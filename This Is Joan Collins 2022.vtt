00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.640
Okay. so what
are we waiting for?

3
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.360
We're
getting a nice light.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Official YIFY movies site:

5
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.640
All right.

6
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.680
You look great.
have a look at that-

7
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.800
Well. I look fine in life.

8
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.400
That's what I'm saying.

9
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.920
And usually. I should
look better on the screen

10
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.280
than I do in life.

11
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.040
I'm just gonna move out.

12
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.840
They're just gonna stick
a film light in Joan.

13
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.480
if that's all right?

14
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.680
See. this light is great.
if this is right on my face.

15
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.160
This light is not flattering
because you've got the-

16
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.120
So. this is for your
all big key light down here.

17
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.480
Yeah. I'm getting stiff now.

18
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.320
let's go. let's
just do something.

19
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.320
Are we ready?

20
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.080
Okay. ready. I'm gonna start.

21
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.520
Are we on?

22
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.480
Lovely Joan Collins.

23
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.680
Dame Joan
Collins. everybody!

24
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.320
Okay. listen up.

25
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.200
I've been around for a
while. and you know what?

26
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.920
It's tough.

27
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.680
I was in Hollywood in what
is called the Golden Age.

28
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.600
and believe me. it wasn't
all chauffeurs and champagne.

29
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.160
Although. along with
my famous alter ego.

30
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.640
Alexis in "Dynasty." I've
had my share of both.

31
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.120
They used to say that female
stars were finished at 27.

32
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.440
but here I am. after seven
decades in the business.

33
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.080
to tell you a thing or two

34
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.240
about how to survive the
perils of the profession.

35
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.520
and what it really feels
like to get what you want.

36
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.880
So this is my story. and
I'm going to tell it my way.

37
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.960
So. right. what are we
gonna call this film?

38
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.280
I was thinking I should
start with Hollywood.

39
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.680
or maybe Mummy and Daddy.

40
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.240
You know what?

41
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.880
I'm just gonna start with me.

42
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.360
It's hard to believe. I know.

43
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.960
but when I started
out in this business.

44
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.400
I wasn't at all
interested in stardom.

45
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.440
I didn't want to be a star.

46
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.200
I had no intention of
wanting to be a star.

47
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.960
I wanted to be an actress
on the stage in England.

48
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.440
Let him approach.

49
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.480
Now. my game plan was
to go to drama school.

50
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.240
graduate to the West End.

51
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.800
and eventually become
a serious actress

52
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.560
of the British theatre.

53
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.760
Exactly how many years have
you been in this business?

54
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.040
Well. I'll tell you.

55
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.240
I actually made my
first tottering steps

56
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.120
onto the stage at
the age of three.

57
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.240
I retired for a bit.
went to nursery school.

58
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.160
then resumed my training
with Grandma Hetty.

59
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.800
Here's Grandma Hetty.
I love this picture.

60
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.280
It says Miss Hetty
Collins. comedy and dance.

61
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.560
and she's doing the splits

62
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.480
and she taught me
to do the splits

63
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.320
when I was about three or four.

64
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.400
Here she is. where she
loves to be. behind the bar.

65
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.840
and she liked a bit
of a bevvy. she did.

66
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.200
This is a picture of
my Auntie Pauline.

67
00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.840
you think that Playboy
was risque. look at that.

68
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.760
And that's where I
inherited it from. maybe.

69
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.760
Here is Daddy.

70
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.120
This is when he was
a hotshot agent.

71
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.360
He was very good looking.

72
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.600
Daddy ran a highly
successful theatrical agency

73
00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.920
in the West End.

74
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.600
They were mostly
vaudeville artists.

75
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.720
and it was a virtual
job centre for singers.

76
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.160
acrobats. ventriloquists
and jugglers.

77
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.680
"This Is Your Life."
this very afternoon

78
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.240
at Heathrow Airport.
from Hollywood.

79
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.680
a glamorous. controversial.

80
00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.400
gossip writers' dream
of a film star arrives.

81
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.520
Why was I always controversial?

82
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.600
What did I do that
was so controversial?

83
00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.960
Just had a few boyfriends.
got married a few times.

84
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.920
Oh. hi you. happy birthday!

85
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.880
-Joan-
-What are you doing here?

86
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.480
I know you crossed the Atlantic

87
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.040
especially to be with
your dad for his birthday.

88
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.440
Oh God!

89
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.200
But he's got a surprise
for you. and so have I.

90
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.680
Joan Collins. tonight.
"This Is Your Life."

91
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.720
I can't believe this!

92
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.280
You're joking!

93
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.080
I. you didn't?

94
00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.240
Joan Collins star of
more than 50 films.

95
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.600
and roles from good
time girl to a nun.

96
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.800
from chorus girl
to Regency lady.

97
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.440
You were born at the family
home in London's Maida Vale.

98
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.400
I was born
sometime between the end

99
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.240
of the Great Depression and
the beginning of World War II.

100
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.600
"Any woman who would reveal
her age would reveal anything."

101
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.240
thus said Oscar Wilde.
and I agree with him.

102
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.360
Not many young men

103
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.240
have to work as hard as Tony.

104
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.480
but then not many bosses
are like Fontaine.

105
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.080
I attempted to shave
a few years off my age

106
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.600
when I was promoting "The Stud."

107
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.480
It's an emergency.

108
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.080
However. the Daily Mirror
dug up my birth certificate.

109
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.120
Joan Collins lies about her age!

110
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.000
Oh God. you'd think I'd
murdered a convent full of nuns.

111
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.080
The reason that actresses
lie about their age.

112
00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.680
and believe me.

113
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.320
I am not the only actress
who has ever done it.

114
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.440
as you can tell.

115
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.840
is because of agents.
producers and directors.

116
00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.640
So you do it purely to
survive in the business.

117
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.760
you do not do it from any
point of view of vanity.

118
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.520
I hadn't seen this book
for a hundred years.

119
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.000
but let me see if a
nice picture of Mummy.

120
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.640
Oh yeah. there's loads
of pictures of her.

121
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.720
with Jackie and me.

122
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.200
-Yeah.
-Yeah. she looks lovely.

123
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.760
She was a wonderful mother.

124
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.320
she was very kind. very caring.
the perfect woman really.

125
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.080
My father was the dominant
male figure. whose word was law

126
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.360
and my mother was the sweet.
beautiful. pleasing woman

127
00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.840
and he was the boss.

128
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.240
And she was so busy trying
to please him all the time.

129
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.760
and I hated that. I hated that.

130
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.960
I vowed. my God.

131
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.000
I'm not gonna have to depend
on a man for everything.

132
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.880
I have to have my own identity.

133
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.120
I can't pinpoint exactly

134
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.240
when I stopped being
Daddy's little darling.

135
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.360
it could have been when
little baby Jackie arrived.

136
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.760
London inferno.

137
00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.080
It could
have been the war.

138
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.840
when we were speedily
packed off to Brighton.

139
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.680
Warning. devastation
in a Britain under siege.

140
00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.920
At the height of the
Blitz we moved back to London.

141
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.920
probably because Mummy didn't
want to leave Daddy alone.

142
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.400
By now. he was
37. very handsome.

143
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.280
and no doubt catnip to the
actresses and chorus girls

144
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.120
who surrounded him.

145
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.240
The
German Armed Forces

146
00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.040
have been utterly defeated.

147
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.600
Then. miraculously.
the war was over.

148
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.400
One day I came home from school

149
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.720
and sitting in the hall was
one of the most handsome men

150
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.240
I'd ever seen.

151
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.640
"How do you do?

152
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.440
You must be Joan.
I'm Roger Moore."

153
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.760
"Daddy. I've just got to
be an actress." I said.

154
00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.920
He didn't want me
to be in showbiz

155
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.040
because he knew the pitfalls.

156
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.240
You know. you'll be
finished before you're 23.

157
00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.200
and the men are so predatory.

158
00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.800
He knew before the 'Me Too'
movement. how they were.

159
00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:58.640
My father also gave me some
very good advice about showbiz.

160
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.280
he said that it's really
the toughest profession

161
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.680
that you can go into.
that it is dog-eat-dog.

162
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.120
Nothing if not stubborn.

163
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.840
I persuaded him that
it was my true calling.

164
00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:14.400
and just like
Alexis. I got my way.

165
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.880
Now you
say you were trained.

166
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:16.680
that was in England?

167
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.040
Yes.

168
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.320
Where did
you do your training?

169
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.600
At the Royal Academy
of Dramatic Art.

170
00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.920
Ah.
well that's considered

171
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.880
the outstanding
school. isn't it?

172
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.600
Yes. I suppose it is.

173
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.000
Mummy walked me to
RADA on my first day.

174
00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.640
"Are you nervous. darling?"

175
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.480
"No. not at all." I lied.

176
00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.160
"Let's face it. Mummy.

177
00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.120
I do have a show
business background."

178
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.640
Let's turn to the
organs of articulation.

179
00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.920
your tongue and your lips.

180
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.240
I simply loved being at RADA.

181
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.560
and we studied every
aspect of our craft.

182
00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.480
Fencing. voice projection.
expressive dancing.

183
00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.840
I remember one of the end
of term reports that I got.

184
00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.800
What kind of an accent is that?

185
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.560
And it said. Miss Collins
has certainly some talent

186
00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.280
and is a very attractive girl.

187
00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.160
but if she doesn't
watch her projection.

188
00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.680
it'll be the films for her
and that would be such a pity.

189
00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.360
Oh yeah. I'm trying
to be American.

190
00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:26.640
Whilst at RADA. I moonlighted
as a teenage photo model.

191
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.040
Then suddenly. an
agent saw my pictures

192
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.120
and persuaded me.
reluctantly. to go into films.

193
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.520
Girls. please.

194
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.160
My first film
was a little epic

195
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.800
in which I had one line
as a beauty contestant.

196
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.520
This was followed
by what would become

197
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.720
my teenage delinquent roles.

198
00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.680
The head of RADA was appalled.

199
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.200
"You simply cannot
go into films!

200
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:54.640
They're just attractive faces
and none of them can act."

201
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:59.480
But the film was offering me
a 300 pound a week salary.

202
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.960
I called my agent.

203
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.760
"You're going to have to give
up RADA. Joanie." he said.

204
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.720
And I did.

205
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.240
It was sad. but it was the
best decision I ever made.

206
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.440
"I Believe in You" gave
me my first proper role.

207
00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.360
Celia Johnson played
my probation officer.

208
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.800
She's an old cow.

209
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.320
That's rather
childish. isn't it?

210
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.040
And then there
was Laurence Harvey.

211
00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.960
Larry epitomised a lifestyle

212
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.560
to which I knew I would
eventually become accustomed.

213
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.160
Luxurious life. the
fine restaurants.
international travel.

214
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.960
gorgeous clothes and
sophisticated parties.

215
00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.720
"I'm going to educate
you. little girl."

216
00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.200
he said sipping
a vintage claret.

217
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.360
I only wish he'd warned
me about Maxwell Reed.

218
00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:58.000
the swashbuckling actor to
whom he had introduced me.

219
00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.120
Hey. Gilliatt!

220
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.400
You dirty pirate thief!

221
00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:07.080
Maxwell Reed was a
very handsome film star.

222
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.760
When I was at school.

223
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.720
I would stick pictures
of all my favourite idols

224
00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:16.560
under my desk. Danny Kaye.
Gene Kelly and Maxwell Reed.

225
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.520
Well. my friend. the
more I see of this girl.

226
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.840
the better I like her.

227
00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:24.280
He asked me out. I
instantly accepted.

228
00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.920
A gigantic powder blue Buick

229
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.200
drew up outside
Bayswater tube station.

230
00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:36.440
"Hi baby. how's it going?"

231
00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.600
He had an American accent.

232
00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.040
which was quite odd for
a man from South London.

233
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:46.480
He was 33. I was
17 and a virgin.

234
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.760
I knew that this would
cause trouble at home.

235
00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:54.640
Oh God. do we really
have to have this bit in?

236
00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:56.320
-Is it-
-I think we do.

237
00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.760
Okay. let's go on.

238
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.400
"Where are we going?"

239
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.240
"You'll see. baby.
it'll be a surprise."

240
00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.560
And it was.

241
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.080
In those days.

242
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.320
my mother would've said
I was taken advantage of.

243
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.920
now we call it date rape.

244
00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:17.760
When she was young.

245
00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.360
Joan Collins went out with a man

246
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.200
who beat. drugged and raped her.

247
00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.800
How did she get even?

248
00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.480
She married him.

249
00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.080
Had I not been so innocent
about men and about sex

250
00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.360
and about the way
things should be.

251
00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.000
I wouldn't have done that.

252
00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.960
but I had this strong long
sense of guilt. so I did it.

253
00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.480
The honeymoon was a fiasco.

254
00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:42.520
outwardly we looked happy.
but I was miserable.

255
00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.320
I didn't know about sex.
and nobody knew about sex

256
00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.560
because it wasn't
as freely available.

257
00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.800
you didn't see on Page Three
of your popular newspapers.

258
00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.480
I'd never even seen a
girl without her clothes.

259
00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.400
let alone a man.

260
00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.760
Now you can clean
all those awkward places.

261
00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:01.040
That dust catching gap between
the carpet and the wall.

262
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.280
those dark depths down
the back of the chairs.

263
00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.960
"I shall do no
cleaning or shopping."

264
00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.680
I announced grandly
to the Daily Mirror.

265
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.760
And I got hate mail from
women all over England.

266
00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:12.720
"How dare you?"

267
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:13.960
"You're not a proper woman."

268
00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.560
"You don't like
cooking and cleaning?"

269
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.760
I said. "No. I don't like
cooking and cleaning."

270
00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.760
Well. this is certainly
a very great honour

271
00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.880
to be chosen this year. Miss
Press Clippings of 1952.

272
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.160
The award
was given to the star

273
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.520
who has had the
year's best publicity

274
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.480
heaped upon her shoulder.

275
00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.640
Quiet on set.
camera rolling.

276
00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.360
The J. Arthur Rank Organisation

277
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.960
was the most powerful
film company in Britain.

278
00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.480
and I was being
groomed for stardom.

279
00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.920
So this book is the book that
Jackie. my sister. kept of me.

280
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.920
and she kept all
my press clippings

281
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
and this is one of the
first ones. August. 1951.

282
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.760
It says "You'll be
seeing more of her."

283
00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.000
Even then I was cast in
the more feisty roles.

284
00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.520
Call yourselves men!

285
00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.000
You're nothing but a
bunch of stupid kids

286
00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.720
that can't be trusted.

287
00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.600
Well. I've been doing some
thinking since last night.

288
00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:05.520
and from now on I'm in charge.

289
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:09.960
These are all when
I was 16. 17. 18.

290
00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.640
"Delightful Delinquent."

291
00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.320
So. with Joan
wearing all the nice things

292
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.960
the press said about her.

293
00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.120
husband Maxwell Reed took his
lovely film star wife home.

294
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.880
But as I was becoming hot.
Max was becoming cold.

295
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.840
"Meet Sheikh Abdul
Ben Kafir." said Max.

296
00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.440
We were in Les Ambassadeurs.

297
00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.720
a terribly chic
nightclub in Mayfair.

298
00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.560
Max had a habit of gravitating
towards rich elderly men

299
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.000
and I was starting
to get a vague idea

300
00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.840
of what this was all about.

301
00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.640
"He'll pay you 10.000
pounds for one night

302
00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.000
and I can even watch."

303
00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.600
"I beg your pardon?

304
00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.400
Are you seriously
suggesting that I go to bed

305
00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.120
with that disgusting
old man for money?"

306
00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.840
"One night. baby. that's all."

307
00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:04.600
I looked at my handsome.
loathsome husband
and began to cry.

308
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.200
"Never in a million years!"

309
00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:11.240
My life was not going
according to plan.

310
00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.680
I went home to Mummy.

311
00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.560
My first marriage I really
don't think I should count

312
00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.080
because I was only
17 and it was.

313
00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:27.360
had I been more worldly wise.
I would not have married.

314
00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:33.280
I look at myself as I was
and I think that is not me.

315
00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.920
Mr. Halsey. you are
your wife agent wanted

316
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.560
on the telephone.

317
00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.000
After making several
successful British movies.

318
00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.080
including this one. I
received a call from my agent.

319
00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.120
"Howard Hawks is making
the Warner Brothers film.

320
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:53.400
"Land of the Pharaohs" in
Rome. and he wants you."

321
00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.240
This was my lucky
break and I knew it.

322
00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.160
because this was an epic movie.

323
00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:08.680
Egypt.
50 centuries ago.

324
00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.840
Within three weeks. I
was whisked off to Rome

325
00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.440
to play the evil
Princess Nellifer.

326
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.720
Don't ever do that again!

327
00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.600
Just how legendary
director Howard Hawks

328
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:24.280
became involved with this
one is a mystery to me.

329
00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:28.960
However. this lavish costume
drama is now a cult movie.

330
00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.360
Look at me. Treneh.

331
00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.680
I'm afraid to.

332
00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.400
Sydney Chaplin.
son of the Charlie.

333
00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.040
played my lover on the
screen and in real life.

334
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.040
La dolce vita was in full swing.

335
00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.360
Syd had a nippy sports car.

336
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.200
and I adored the velocity
and implicit danger

337
00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.000
in those mad drives.

338
00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.800
I'm rather partial
to living in Rome.

339
00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.840
I thought it was
just marvellous.

340
00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.680
At 20. you think
you're immortal.

341
00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.880
nothing was to be
taken seriously

342
00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.720
and after my life of
torment with Maxwell Reed.

343
00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.200
that was okay by me.

344
00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:15.080
"$350 a week. what do you
think of that. Joanie?"

345
00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.320
20th Century Fox was
offering me a contract.

346
00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.960
but I was not about
to sell myself short.

347
00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:24.640
"It's not enough. John.

348
00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:28.920
I want 1.250 or I'll just be
another cheap contract girl."

349
00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.480
Believe it or not.
Fox accepted my terms.

350
00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.520
but they wanted me in
California immediately.

351
00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:42.320
Amidst tears and laughter.
I hugged Mummy and Daddy.

352
00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.120
Jackie and my new
little brother. Bill.

353
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.040
I was going to start a
new life in Hollywood.

354
00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.840
259. take one.

355
00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.320
I arrived in Tinseltown

356
00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.120
at the end of the
Golden Age of cinema

357
00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.000
when the gold was just
beginning to tarnish.

358
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.520
I became part of the last
wave of the contract system.

359
00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.120
when actors were
signed to studios.

360
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.960
Robert Wagner. Kim
Novak. Jayne Mansfield.

361
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.560
And introducing

362
00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.120
Hollywood's most exciting new
personality. Joan Collins.

363
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.080
And now little old me.

364
00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.080
You went to these parties
and you saw Lana Turner

365
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.040
and Rita Hayworth and
Clark Gable and Cary Grant.

366
00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:35.240
all looking just as
good. if not better.

367
00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.600
than they did on the screen.

368
00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.680
I met Joan Crawford
once. who's terrifying.

369
00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.200
and not beautiful at all.

370
00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.840
I will never forget seeing
the dangerously gorgeous

371
00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.600
Ava Gardner.

372
00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.760
She was having a screaming
argument with her date.

373
00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.640
She looked entrancing
and powerful.

374
00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:59.880
like a jungle cat fiercely
protecting her territory.

375
00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.640
the barefoot contessa.

376
00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.760
Years later. this
image came back to me

377
00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.360
when I was thinking
about how to play Alexis.

378
00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.560
but that's for later.

379
00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.640
In Hollywood. I was still
on the nursery slopes.

380
00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:17.520
I was a scruffy
little kid from London

381
00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.400
with sort of blue jeans
and polo neck sweaters.

382
00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.160
and they had to groom
and glamorise me.

383
00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.640
which they did to a tee.

384
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.040
The studio did
everything in its power

385
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.680
to protect us from scandal.

386
00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.080
No hint of
drunkenness. adultery.

387
00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:40.960
or heaven forbid. homosexuality.
ever made the newspapers.

388
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.560
Hollywood was in the business
of selling beautiful dreams.

389
00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.000
The outfits the stars
wore on the screen

390
00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.120
were as important. if not more.
than the films themselves.

391
00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.360
I wonder where the
mystique has gone now.

392
00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:01.960
I wonder where
the glamor's gone.

393
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:08.360
This is a very prized
possession. it weighs a tonne.

394
00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.840
This is my childhood scrapbook.

395
00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.280
I loved movies. I love films.

396
00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.640
so I started keeping
the scrapbooks

397
00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.120
with all my favourite stars in.

398
00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.560
They certainly were
glamorous in those days.

399
00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:22.880
Look at these pictures.

400
00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:26.800
I mean. Hedy Lamarr.
absolutely ravishing.

401
00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.440
They were all beautiful.

402
00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.600
Oh. Richard Widmark.

403
00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.200
All of the girls at school.

404
00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:38.120
we got a tremendous crush on
Richard Widmark. very sinister.

405
00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:44.040
I adored Jean Simmons. I thought
she was just so wonderful.

406
00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.640
she was the one I really
wanted to look like.

407
00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.560
I didn't know when I was
cutting all these pictures out

408
00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:52.520
that many. many of these people.
I would either work with.

409
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.520
I mean. for example. Gene Kelly.

410
00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.760
Bob Hope I loved. I
got to work with him.

411
00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.760
Joan Fontaine. well. I worked
with her a couple of times.

412
00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.600
When she is making
pictures in California.

413
00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.160
Joan Collins enjoys this
view from her small house.

414
00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.640
perched high in the hills
overlooking Hollywood.

415
00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.080
Hello Joan.

416
00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.720
Hello Charles.

417
00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.400
Soon after arriving
in Hollywood.

418
00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.760
I went to a party

419
00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:23.120
and I met three of the
most brilliant actors

420
00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.880
of the 20th century.

421
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:29.320
Marlon Brando. James
Dean and Paul Newman.

422
00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:34.160
all sitting together on one
sofa. the method actors.

423
00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.320
Hey. Stella!

424
00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.840
The method. well.
what is the method?

425
00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.280
Flawed.
troubled. anti-heroes.

426
00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:46.720
Marlon's brooding sensual
looks mesmerised everyone.

427
00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.880
"It's a bums life.
means nothing.

428
00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:53.960
acting is fundamentally
a childish thing to do."

429
00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:58.800
I asked him why. if he hated
acting so much. he made movies.

430
00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:03.080
He smiled. "Money. doll. money."

431
00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:13.200
Now I was 21 and I was in my
first big Hollywood movie.

432
00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.760
"The Virgin Queen."

433
00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:18.960
starring the utterly
terrifying Bette Davis.

434
00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.320
Your Majesty.

435
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.720
Bette played
Queen Elizabeth I.

436
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.960
I played one of
her hand maidens.

437
00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:30.520
Take care how you treat
your queen's possessions.

438
00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:31.960
Mistress Throckmorton.

439
00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.560
I'm sorry. ma'am.

440
00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.920
Bette didn't particularly
like young actresses.

441
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
in real life or on screen.

442
00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.680
Take this strumpet away!

443
00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.080
Take her away!

444
00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.680
"Don't they
teach you anything

445
00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.640
at those English drama
schools. you little fool?"

446
00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.720
She snarled between takes.

447
00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.440
By now. the studio was pulling
out all the stops with me.

448
00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.120
and I was caught up
in the merry-go-round

449
00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.040
of being made into a star.

450
00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:13.400
And in 1955 I was cast in "The
Girl in the Red Velvet Swing"

451
00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.040
with Ray Milland.

452
00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:25.040
I didn't mean it to be
that sort of a kiss.

453
00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.720
I didn't either.

454
00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.680
I loved making
this fabulous film.

455
00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.680
although the costumes.
gorgeous to look at.

456
00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:31.960
were agony to wear.

457
00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.880
The hats were secured
with lethal pins.

458
00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.040
the collars had
little bones in them.

459
00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.480
so if I moved my head too much.

460
00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:41.080
I would get stabbed
in the throat.

461
00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.320
Goodbye. all of you.

462
00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.960
Despite the stunning costumes
and the good reviews for me.

463
00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:55.000
the film didn't do well at
the box office. c'est la vie.

464
00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.120
But I was learning my craft

465
00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.600
and I loved everything
about Hollywood.

466
00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.440
This young
star has been described

467
00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.880
by a Hollywood chief as
the greatest screen asset

468
00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.960
America has imported
from Britain.

469
00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.640
Since she began work there.

470
00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.840
she has climbed rapidly to
stardom. and in doing so.

471
00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.080
has acquired a full measure of
transatlantic sophistication.

472
00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:20.920
Bob. your impressions
of Hollywood. please.

473
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.960
Did you see Joan Collins
while you were there?

474
00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.360
I met Joan Collins while
I was there earlier. yes.

475
00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.040
To me. she seemed
quite American.

476
00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.560
I mean. she had been
given an American accent

477
00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:32.080
and she talked with a very
strong American accent

478
00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.800
and American phrases.

479
00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.080
She seemed to me to have lost
a specific English quality

480
00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.440
that she had over here.

481
00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.800
You must remember.

482
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.160
when a girl like Joan
goes over to Hollywood.

483
00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.000
they're given enormous training

484
00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.720
when they're under
contract with a studio.

485
00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:48.000
but they're also given an
accent and a tone of speech

486
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.760
that makes them suitable
to American audiences.

487
00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:55.960
Now. the name Darryl F. Zanuck

488
00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:58.040
is probably familiar
to most of you.

489
00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:00.600
for he is one of the
most remarkable figures

490
00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:03.520
in the film industry today.

491
00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:04.400
Hi. Mr. Zanuck.

492
00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.400
Good to see you.

493
00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.240
Darryl Zanuck. the head of Fox.

494
00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.920
was one of the
first studio bosses

495
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.560
to have his own steam room
connected to his office.

496
00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.560
I'd heard all the
rumours about Zanuck.

497
00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:18.360
Not long after I arrived.

498
00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.560
he chased me along a corridor
and trapped me against a wall.

499
00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:24.000
he pinned me like a
beetle to a board.

500
00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.640
"You need a real man.
honey. a real man."

501
00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.160
God. he was actually
giving me the oldest line

502
00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.040
in the business.

503
00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:35.000
Luckily. a makeup man
came down the corridor

504
00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.600
and I was able to escape.

505
00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.280
Basically. I'm a
survivor. I have survived.

506
00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:46.480
I have survived
being a young female

507
00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.800
in a business when practically
all the men were predators.

508
00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.160
My father used to say.

509
00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:55.800
"Just give them a knee
in the you-know-what."

510
00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.440
Joan.
do most of the people

511
00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:00.560
whom you do see out here. are
they in motion pictures too?

512
00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.480
Well. I think that everybody
that lives in Los Angeles.

513
00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.680
practically. that I meet is
connected in some way or another

514
00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:06.840
with motion pictures.

515
00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.200
One night at a party
at Gene Kelly's house.

516
00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.880
I siddled up to the bar

517
00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:16.560
and I sat next to a
rather nondescript blonde

518
00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.280
who was sitting by herself.

519
00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.400
"Hi. I'm Marilyn." she said.

520
00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.560
"Hi. I'm Joan."

521
00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.640
Yes. it was she. the
biggest star in the world.

522
00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.120
She was the first girl that
I'd ever seen walking around.

523
00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:33.920
this is like the mid
fifties. without a bra.

524
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.400
in a woollen dress. very
daring in those days.

525
00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.320
And she was just
sitting quite quietly.

526
00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.440
I studied Marilyn Monroe in awe.

527
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:44.760
her face. almost devoid of
makeup. seemed ordinary.

528
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.320
It was hard to believe

529
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.920
she was not only the
biggest star in the world.

530
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
but in retrospect. the greatest
sex goddess of the century.

531
00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:00.360
We chatted.

532
00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:04.040
"Don't let the studio big guys
dictate to you." she warned.

533
00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:08.360
"You're just a piece of
meat to them. we all are.

534
00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:11.400
The Fox bosses are
the most dangerous."

535
00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:14.120
"What do you mean?"
I ask naively.

536
00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.960
"Wolves." mouthed Marilyn.

537
00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.920
looking nervously
over her shoulder

538
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.640
as if expecting one to jump
out from behind a sofa.

539
00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.960
"Look out for Zanuck."
she whispered.

540
00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:28.600
"Do you know what
everybody said about me

541
00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.840
in my first year at Fox?"

542
00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:32.920
I was spellbound.

543
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.800
"They said I was handed around
guys like hors d'oeuvres.

544
00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.440
all of them. can
you believe it?"

545
00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.840
I starred at her. she
gave me her gorgeous smile

546
00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.600
and then I understood why
the world was so bedazzled

547
00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:49.960
by Marilyn Monroe.

548
00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.120
We had another drink and
I watched her shimmy away.

549
00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.480
I never saw Marilyn
Monroe again.

550
00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:01.120
but when I was in Rome in 1962

551
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.320
and I heard the
news of her death.

552
00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:07.720
I must say I wept for her
and for all of her pain.

553
00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.960
After a year at Fox.

554
00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.880
I was loaned out to MGM
for "The Opposite Sex."

555
00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.320
And there I was in a
bathtub covered in suds

556
00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:29.120
when a server walked up and
slapped me with a subpoena.

557
00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:33.360
Maxwell Reed. that
swashbuckling pirate. was back.

558
00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:38.080
demanding $1.250 a
month in support.

559
00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:41.600
"He discovered me."
he said. what a liar!

560
00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:44.120
And just like the pirate in
one of his cheesy movies.

561
00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:48.760
he demanded I hand over the
money he said he deserved.

562
00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.840
You know. it's a funny
thing how much I like money.

563
00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:52.840
and a pretty woman.

564
00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:58.320
That divorce cost
me over $10.000.

565
00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.360
I had to pay Max's legal fees

566
00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:03.360
and give him all the
money in my bank account.

567
00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:07.600
I never heard of a woman
being sued for alimony before.

568
00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:12.440
And here was Maxwell Reed
who. when I divorced him.

569
00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.680
I tore out most
of these pictures

570
00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:18.160
'cause I didn't want
to see them anymore.

571
00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:22.560
With my sister. Jackie. I
left the courtroom aged 23.

572
00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:27.440
poorer. wiser and with a
growing distrust of all men

573
00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.520
and that was divorce number one.

574
00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:37.200
Although women's liberation
was not yet upon us.

575
00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:40.040
I have always considered
myself to be an early model

576
00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.600
of an emancipated woman.

577
00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:47.560
I've always considered myself
to be an early feminist.

578
00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:51.040
feminist. yes. much better
than emancipated woman.

579
00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.640
I made my own money and
I lived by my own rules.

580
00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:59.080
So after my divorce. I
lived with several men.

581
00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:05.000
And after my divorce. after my
divorce. I did what I liked.

582
00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:10.960
I did what I liked.

583
00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:12.320
Is that
because several men

584
00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.360
sounds like several men
all at once. that's why-

585
00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:18.560
Yes. which was
not true.

586
00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:19.880
No. no.

587
00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:23.000
I was. I was a
serial monogamist.

588
00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:24.440
if you know what I mean.

589
00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:28.720
Always true to one man.
and one after another.

590
00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:36.240
By 1958. I had already
appeared in several movies

591
00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:39.720
with some of the most attractive
male stars in Hollywood.

592
00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.600
Paul Newman being one of them.

593
00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.520
I think I can be very
funny. she said modestly.

594
00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:58.920
Gregory Peck was the most
elegant leading man of all.

595
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.520
Go after them. Jim.
and catch them.

596
00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:04.760
Get them. kill them.
kill them. kill them!

597
00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.040
In contrast to his shivery

598
00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:11.160
was the Neanderthal
Richard Burton.

599
00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.760
I played opposite
him in "Sea Wife."

600
00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.040
This is one of the
most stirring stories

601
00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.600
of our time.

602
00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.920
A film about a nun
wrecked on a desert island

603
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.560
with three men.

604
00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.520
All this time. I've been
so near you. all this time.

605
00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.080
We had onscreen chemistry.

606
00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:31.000
but then he made the obligatory
pass as most actors do

607
00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:33.080
and charmingly admitted to me

608
00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:37.920
he would bonk a snake if it
was wearing a skirt. wow!

609
00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.480
On the lot I
found Richard Burton.

610
00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.320
Joan Collins and their
director. Bob McNaught.

611
00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.600
taking a tea break.

612
00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.040
Joan plays the
unusual part of a nun.

613
00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:47.240
something quite new for her.

614
00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.400
I'd admired Burton for years.

615
00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:52.320
he was another one of my
school girl autographs.

616
00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.560
"Dear Ms. Collins. thank
you for your letter.

617
00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.480
best wishes. Richard Burton."

618
00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.600
I've given my word
to someone else.

619
00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:03.920
And here I was acting
opposite this paragon.

620
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.480
the great Richard Burton
was a scalp collector.

621
00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.120
but no way was I tempted.

622
00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.840
Although I saw many
other women fall

623
00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.600
like nine pins at his feet.

624
00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.400
He was a bit of a wolf.

625
00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.120
he was known to be
a bit of a wolf.

626
00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:23.960
I'm surprised
Elizabeth married him.

627
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.400
Don't you love me?

628
00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:29.360
Don't you want Egypt?

629
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.400
Don't you want the world?

630
00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:37.920
I spent early 1959
testing to play Cleopatra

631
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.960
in Fox's big blockbuster.

632
00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:44.200
If you were a king. your
son would reign after you.

633
00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.440
I have no son.

634
00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:46.360
Then get one.

635
00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:51.880
Naturally. the casting
couch reared its ugly head.

636
00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:55.320
The chairman at Fox made it
clear that he had a lot to say

637
00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:58.840
when it came to casting.
"He should know better."

638
00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.960
I thought as I skipped
out of his clutches.

639
00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:03.560
If you slept with the producer.

640
00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.640
you could have been Cleopatra.

641
00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.040
If I slept with a producer.

642
00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.560
I could have played
any part I wanted to

643
00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:11.320
at 20th Century Fox.
those were the days!

644
00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.960
But I didn't. I prefer to
sleep with younger men.

645
00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.680
So I didn't get
the Cleopatra part

646
00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.760
and I was drowning
my sorrows one night

647
00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:25.080
when I became aware of a
young man staring at me

648
00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:28.160
"That Shirley McLean's kid
brother. Warren." said my agent

649
00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:32.520
and the next day the phone
rang and it was Warren.

650
00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:35.680
"Do you wanna have dinner
with me tonight?" He said.

651
00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:36.640
When
you first meet him.

652
00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.040
I think you are 23 and he's 22

653
00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:40.680
and you're famous
and he's not famous.

654
00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:44.400
"He's not famous. he's
broke and he's got spots!"

655
00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.480
said my best friend.
Cappie Badrutt.

656
00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:49.320
but I wasn't bothered by
a man not having money.

657
00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:50.960
in fact. I preferred it

658
00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:53.000
as I believe that if a
man could buy anything.

659
00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.280
it usually meant he thought
it could buy me too.

660
00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.520
I liked Warren Beatty.
I liked his humour.

661
00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.960
his conversation and
his physical packaging.

662
00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:08.040
You said he had to
ring you 80 times a day.

663
00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:11.280
Oh. I didn't say 80. 60 maybe.

664
00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:13.720
I'd heard that men were
at their sexual peak

665
00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.960
between the ages of 17 and 23

666
00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.640
and if Warren was anything
to go by. this was true.

667
00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:24.920
I got a lot of flack from
the studio and also from-

668
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.600
Because of the publicity?

669
00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:28.440
No. because it was shocking.
people didn't live together.

670
00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:29.400
No they didn't.

671
00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:30.680
They just did not do that.

672
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.040
While I was living with Warren.

673
00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:38.000
I was also learning to strip
for the movie "Seven Thieves."

674
00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:44.720
And I was lucky enough to have
the best stripper in America

675
00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.080
as my coach.

676
00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:49.960
Candy Bar taught me
more about sensuality

677
00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:53.560
than I'd learned in all
my years under contract.

678
00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:58.360
At the same time I was
doing "Seven Thieves."

679
00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:01.440
I was craming in wardrobe
tests for "Sons and Lovers."

680
00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.800
which was about to
shoot in England.

681
00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:08.520
"Don't go butterfly. don't
leave your bee!" begged Warren.

682
00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.000
What is your biggest
career mistake?

683
00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:13.440
Turning down a movie
called "Sons and Lovers"

684
00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:15.800
that I was asked to do
when I was under contract

685
00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.280
to do Fox and turning it down

686
00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.920
'cause I was going out with
Warren then and he said.

687
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.840
"No. the script stinks." And
Mary Ure won the Oscar for it.

688
00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:30.680
"I think we should get
engaged." said Warren.

689
00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:36.040
So within a week. the columnists
announced our engagement.

690
00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:37.000
Was that a really happy time.

691
00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:37.960
that time with Warren Beatty?

692
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.440
It was happy. it was sad.

693
00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:43.160
it had a lot of ups
and downs. actually.

694
00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:46.000
Warren was insecure
and argumentative.

695
00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:48.600
so he and I made a
volatile combination.

696
00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.960
Unfortunately I see the
person who I'm in love with

697
00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.440
at the time through rose
coloured spectacles.

698
00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:56.640
it's very. very childish
and naive and stupid.

699
00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:58.520
I'm not like that
anymore. obviously.

700
00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:02.320
We argued so much that our last
few months were a hazy blur

701
00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.920
and I knew that marriage
wasn't going to be the answer.

702
00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:09.480
I accepted a film in London

703
00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:12.360
playing opposite Bob
Hope and Bing Crosby.

704
00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:14.560
"It's crap!" said. Warren.

705
00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:16.880
"Why do you need to do it?"

706
00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:20.360
Two reasons. for the money
and to get away from you.

707
00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:25.440
So that was the end of our
relationship and we knew it.

708
00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:29.760
There's
"Violent Love" with Alice

709
00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:31.040
who clung like a Tigress

710
00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:33.120
to the man every
other woman wanted.

711
00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.080
But by now my career
was stagnating.

712
00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:39.120
I was a utility infielder

713
00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.600
starring in run
of the mill films

714
00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:45.200
and if Fox couldn't get Susan
Hayward or Jean Tierney.

715
00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:46.400
they got me.

716
00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:56.080
In "Road to Hong Kong."

717
00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:58.840
I put on the correct
loving expression.

718
00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:01.840
to gaze into Bing
Crosby's bland blue eyes

719
00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.880
and smell his tobacco breath

720
00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:06.320
and wondered how
people could ever think

721
00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:09.040
that an actress's life
was a bowl of cherries.

722
00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:15.120
I'd now passed my
first quarter century.

723
00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:18.760
an age that young actresses
had learned to dread

724
00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:22.000
ever since the studios
had decreed that 27

725
00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:23.960
was the end of beauty.

726
00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.240
Because people think that
if you're good looking.

727
00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:30.280
there's a tendency for there
not to be too much up here.

728
00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.720
it is again. more difficult
to be taken seriously.

729
00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:36.720
Again. I hate that phrase.
why does it keep on coming up.

730
00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:37.880
Like to be regarded.
let me ask you that.

731
00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:39.440
Oh. all different ways.

732
00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:43.240
And as the 1960s
began to flower.

733
00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:46.000
I began to think seriously
about what I wanted to do

734
00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:47.400
with the rest of my life.

735
00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:52.120
I asked Fox for an early
release from my contract.

736
00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:58.400
What are the
future plans for Joan Collins?

737
00:37:58.480 --> 00:37:59.280
Well.

738
00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:16.720
Anthony Newley was a pop star.

739
00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:20.400
a writer and the of English theatre.

740
00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.760
Where'd you meet Tony?

741
00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.840
Backstage. wasn't it
from "Stop the World?"

742
00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:27.000
Yes. I went to see
"Stop the World."

743
00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:30.640
which was then the sort
of greatest play in London

744
00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:33.800
with Robert Wagner who had just
broken up with Natalie Wood

745
00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:36.040
and I had just broken
up with Warren Beatty

746
00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.880
and Natalie and Warren
were seeing each other

747
00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:41.880
and Bob Wagner and I
were seeing each other.

748
00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:43.040
We went to see the play

749
00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:46.120
and I was absolutely
fascinated with Tony.

750
00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.520
he was so wonderful.

751
00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:53.160
I was trying to remember
where I'd seen him before

752
00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:54.760
then it came to me.

753
00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:57.360
he had played the Artful Dodger

754
00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.480
in David Lean's "Oliver Twist."

755
00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:02.320
Now here he was in his twenties.

756
00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.200
satanic and intense looking.

757
00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:07.800
We went backstage to meet him.

758
00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:15.440
"He loves the ladies." my
friend Joyce Blair had told me.

759
00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:18.800
"He's just never been
able to fall in love!"

760
00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:21.720
"A man who has never
been in love." I thought.

761
00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:25.320
"How sad. how challenging."

762
00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:29.440
Three weeks later
we were lovers.

763
00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:34.200
Tony was brilliant.
funny as hell

764
00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:36.920
but underneath raged a
deep distrust of women

765
00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:40.280
but I didn't know that yet.

766
00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.680
"What can a rich.
beautiful film star

767
00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:46.400
see in a cockney half-
Jewish git like me?" he said.

768
00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:48.600
"I'm half Jewish
too." I replied.

769
00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:51.800
"From Maida Vale via
Sunset Boulevard."

770
00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:54.280
I said. "This will be the
father of my children.

771
00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:55.560
he is so wonderful!"

772
00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.920
After a year and a
half we got married

773
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.840
and my gorgeous daughter
Tara was born in 1963.

774
00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:10.200
Motherhood was really exciting

775
00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:12.960
and I love every minute of it.

776
00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.880
London. Polish-born
director Roman Polanski.

777
00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:20.240
Sharon Tate made
for the Playboy club

778
00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.600
and a star studded reception.

779
00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:25.440
Joan Collins and Anthony Newley.

780
00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:27.920
The Tony Newley's got the
star set really shaking.

781
00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:35.160
It was the 1960s. the
time of the English actor.

782
00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:47.640
Michael Kane. Albert Finney.
Peter Sellers. Terrence Stamp

783
00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:49.720
and now. Anthony Newley.

784
00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.520
they were all taking
America by storm.

785
00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:01.840
Suddenly. anything and anyone
British had enormous appeal.

786
00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:07.680
Now Tony's career was
taking off big time.

787
00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:24.400
In 1965. my beautiful
son Alexander was born.

788
00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:27.200
then we bought a house in LA

789
00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:30.120
and we parted furiously
with our showbiz friends.

790
00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:36.640
Paul Newman. Sammy Davis Jr.
Natalie Wood. Julie Andrews

791
00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:38.480
and of course my sister. Jackie.

792
00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:41.840
And guess what?

793
00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:44.400
I decided to retire.

794
00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:52.320
When I married Tony.
I gave it all up.

795
00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:55.960
that was it. goodbye career.
hello babies and cooking.

796
00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:59.800
As far as America was concerned.
I was now totally unknown.

797
00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:04.640
Is the male member
of this duo English?

798
00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.440
Yeah.

799
00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:09.680
Oh. are you Mr. and
Mrs. Tony Newley?

800
00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:14.640
"Oh. that's Anthony
Newley's wife.

801
00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:16.240
didn't she used
to be an actress?"

802
00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:22.600
Enter the wonderful
world of "Doctor Dolittle."

803
00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:24.680
Tony began rehearsing
for his new role

804
00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:28.280
in "Doctor Dolittle." with
the pompus Rex Harrison.

805
00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:31.800
Tony was totally
wrapped up in his work

806
00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:35.640
and although he told me
he loved. I was dubious.

807
00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.840
he was hardly ever at home.

808
00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:42.440
The beautiful house
complete with pool

809
00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:44.440
and two gorgeous children

810
00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:47.560
couldn't make up for
the emptiness I was
beginning to feel.

811
00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:50.800
especially when the
children started school.

812
00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:06.520
Why wasn't I content like
most Beverly Hills housewives

813
00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:10.600
to be a perfect wife. to lie
by the pool and ruin my skin

814
00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:13.040
then go to the
dermatologist to repair it?

815
00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:16.520
To go to the analyst.
the hen parties. the gym?

816
00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:21.160
Women pulled and tucked but
everyone looked the same.

817
00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.920
Why was I so discontented?

818
00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:39.800
And it was then I
suppose that I thought

819
00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:42.880
"I'm not going to live
another 50 or 60 years

820
00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.960
and not have a career

821
00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:47.360
because I can see now my
children at nursery school.

822
00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:50.200
they've left me more or less
for five or six or seven hours

823
00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:51.520
during the day.

824
00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:52.840
what am I going to
do with my life?

825
00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:55.120
Am I gonna sit here and
wash some man's socks?

826
00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:56.440
No. thank you very much.

827
00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:00.840
I wanted to work.
lights. camera action.

828
00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:02.920
it was in my blood
and I missed it.

829
00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:06.800
So I worked in television.

830
00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:09.600
I had been a star. I'd been
a pretty big star in America

831
00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:13.320
for three or four years. not
big like today. but big-ish

832
00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:17.760
and I realised that I like that.

833
00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.280
I realised that I needed that.

834
00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:22.160
to do what was inside me. Joan.

835
00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:25.800
which is to say. I like
acting. I want to act.

836
00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:30.600
The new generation of
actresses were on the scene.

837
00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:34.840
Julie Christie. Ali
MacGraw. Faye Dunaway.

838
00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:37.600
That's Bonnie.
Faye Dunaway.

839
00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:39.760
that's Clyde. Warren Beatty.

840
00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:42.440
Warren Beatty was on the
crest of superstardom.

841
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.800
As well as becoming
the most famous stud

842
00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:47.920
in the Western hemisphere.

843
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.200
I was raising my children.

844
00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:54.360
I was living in California.
which I still do.

845
00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:57.080
I was working in
episodic television.

846
00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:01.840
However. looking back I was
in some pretty big shows.

847
00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.560
The Man from Uncle."
"The Virginia."

848
00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:07.520
"Batman" and "Star Trek."

849
00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:09.360
Excuse us. miss.

850
00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:12.600
we didn't mean to trespass.
it's cold outside.

851
00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.200
A lie is a very poor
way to say hello.

852
00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:17.880
In "Star Trek."

853
00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:20.200
I played a saintly
mission worker

854
00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:23.440
who tries to prove to the world
that Hitler was a nice guy.

855
00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:30.280
so Dr. Spock allows her
to be run over by a truck.

856
00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:35.480
And what do you know?

857
00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:38.960
It became one of the
most popular "Star
Trek" episodes ever.

858
00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:44.760
At home though. storm
clouds were gathering.

859
00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:48.920
Tony and I gazed
sombrely at each other

860
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.640
across our Wedgewood
dinner service.

861
00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.280
the content act and
the communication

862
00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:56.080
just wasn't there anymore.

863
00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:58.680
we were fast drifting part.

864
00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:03.800
"Would you like to dance?"

865
00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:10.280
Ryan O'Neal sat there
looking arrogant and nervous

866
00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:11.840
at the same time.

867
00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:14.160
but he was the first
man I'd found attractive

868
00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:15.680
for a long time.

869
00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:17.120
"Sure!" I said.

870
00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:20.680
I was guesting on a
TV show at Universal

871
00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:25.280
when he showed up on the set.
"What're you doing tomorrow?"

872
00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:27.200
"Tomorrow's my
birthday." I said.

873
00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:29.720
"And Tony's coming
back from New York."

874
00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:33.600
"I'll call and wish you
a happy birthday then."

875
00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:36.040
Tony didn't make it
back for my birthday.

876
00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:38.280
he just sent a bunch of flowers

877
00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:40.640
but suddenly I
decided what I wanted.

878
00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:45.520
A girl should get what she
wants on her birthday. so I did.

879
00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:48.520
I believe very strongly

880
00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:50.240
in being true to the
person that you are with.

881
00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:51.800
I really do believe in that.

882
00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:52.680
You never cheated?

883
00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:54.440
No. I don't. no.

884
00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:59.280
only. yes. in one instance
that was with Ryan O'Neal.

885
00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:01.360
if you're gonna
cheat on somebody.

886
00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:02.000
cheat with Ryan O'Neal.

887
00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:02.640
Of course.

888
00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:03.480
Right?

889
00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:08.960
It was 1968. Sammy
Davis. Jr.. Paul Newman.

890
00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:12.960
Tony and I invested
in the disco business.

891
00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:14.960
it was called The Factory.

892
00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:19.160
everyone was there. proving
what I have always suspected.

893
00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:21.840
that stars would rather
be around other stars

894
00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:23.080
than anyone else.

895
00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:28.000
One night. Robert Kennedy
showed up oozing charm

896
00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:30.760
and sex appeal and
he asked me to dance.

897
00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:36.240
"Why don't you come to
New York next weekend?

898
00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:37.960
I'd really like
to see you again."

899
00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:42.920
Now this was opening
a Pandora's box

900
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.680
into which even I
wasn't prepared to peep.

901
00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:50.000
"Thanks. Bobby. I'd just
love to. but I just can't.

902
00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:51.280
maybe a rain check?"

903
00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:55.720
He gave me a long.
penetrating look.

904
00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:59.040
"You got it. I'll be waiting."

905
00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:07.120
Six months later. I thought
sadly about that rain check.

906
00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:08.760
I was in Malta

907
00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:11.200
when I heard about Robert
Kennedy's assassination.

908
00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:12.520
I was on a film set.

909
00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:18.200
Tony was now achieving
his life's desire

910
00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:20.840
to write. direct and star

911
00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:23.360
in an erotic avant
garde musical-comedy

912
00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:25.520
based entirely on himself.

913
00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:27.640
My wife doesn't understand me.

914
00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:30.000
"Can Heironymus Merkin
Ever Forget Mercy Humppe

915
00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:32.200
and Fine True Happiness?"

916
00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:35.840
was a felinious movie about
a successful actor/director.

917
00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:37.560
that is to say. Tony.

918
00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:40.800
who's torn between new
wild blonde Mercy Humppe

919
00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:46.120
And raven-haired Polyester
Poontang. that's me.

920
00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:50.080
I had a horrible
feeling that Tony

921
00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.680
was spelling out the
death of our marriage.

922
00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:53.960
You were
directed by your husband.

923
00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:56.200
Anthony Newley.
what was that like?

924
00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:57.720
That was interesting.

925
00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:02.600
He didn't have too much
time for me. actually.

926
00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:04.920
he was very busy with the
rest of the female cast.

927
00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:09.400
Oh my God!

928
00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:11.600
I never saw that!

929
00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:15.040
I realised he'd
been having affairs

930
00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:16.920
from the moment we married

931
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.720
and now he was
blatantly making a movie

932
00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:21.440
about all the women he'd bedded.

933
00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:24.560
Oh.

934
00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:26.000
I was shattered.

935
00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:28.760
Well I've had enough.
I'm taking the children.

936
00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:31.720
I'm taking them back to
Europe. anywhere away from you.

937
00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:34.440
And this time. I mean
it. I really do mean it!

938
00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:40.560
Exit Polyester-Joan
sobbing hysterically.

939
00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:44.520
The film was universally panned
and when I finally saw it.

940
00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.560
I knew there was no
hope for my marriage.

941
00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:51.080
It's never been my style
to stay on a sinking ship.

942
00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.000
I left for London
with my children.

943
00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:59.000
I divorced my second husband

944
00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:01.320
because I was not gonna
spend the rest of my life

945
00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:02.920
being married to man who
was unfaithful to me.

946
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000
it was as simple as that.

947
00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:08.040
I'm telling him this because
it's the absolute truth.

948
00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:09.320
Whatever I was and then

949
00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:10.600
here's this man being
unfaithful to me.

950
00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:12.760
am I gonna take this
for the rest of my life?

951
00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:14.720
What's it gonna be like
when I'm. you know. 45?

952
00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:16.120
No.

953
00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:19.040
You say that
his problem was.

954
00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:22.680
he was never gonna
commit fully to marriage.

955
00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:24.680
I mean. you sort of knew
that from the beginning.

956
00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:27.200
so it was gonna. did you not-

957
00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:29.240
I didn't realise. no. no.

958
00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:35.600
he he'd said he was. he had
thought that maybe he couldn't.

959
00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:37.400
but then once we got married.

960
00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:42.040
once we had the family.
then he was committed.

961
00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:47.000
And I think that as he became
more famous in America.

962
00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:51.720
and then he became a star.
he became a different person.

963
00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:57.920
He strayed and he
strayed big time

964
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.680
and it all came out in that
movie. that fucking movie.

965
00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:02.800
oh my God. what a disaster!

966
00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:11.000
My marriage to Tony
had lasted seven years.

967
00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:15.840
the split was amicable.
painful. hurtful. but amicable.

968
00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:27.880
This man in the speed
boat is Ron Kass.

969
00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:36.000
He was an attractive.
tall American

970
00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:39.040
with amazing green eyes
and an endearing smile.

971
00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:45.920
And he was the president
of Apple Records.

972
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.600
the Beatles recording company.

973
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:53.000
Ron knew what he wanted
and he usually got it.

974
00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:54.960
and what he wanted was me.

975
00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:58.040
We spent time
discovering each other

976
00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:00.520
and the more I discovered.
the more I liked.

977
00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:08.520
When you first meet a man.

978
00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:10.960
what is more likely to
make him attractive to you?

979
00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:14.080
His eyes. his voice.
or his physique?

980
00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:15.440
I'll say physique.

981
00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:16.280
You'll
say the physique?

982
00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:17.920
Yeah.

983
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.000
Well. I mean. you can have
great eyes and a great voice.

984
00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:24.360
but if you ain't got the
bod. you ain't got nothin'.

985
00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:25.920
Yeah. that's
what the Mrs. Said.

986
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:27.960
the physique. you got it!

987
00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:32.680
The following. you
Ron and I married.

988
00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:35.720
Now Ron had three children
from his first marriage.

989
00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:39.760
so we all moved into a lovely
family house in London.

990
00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:44.320
It was exactly what I had
wanted. a warm family home

991
00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:47.480
and soon after that. my
darling Katyana was born.

992
00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:52.320
I was now in my mid thirties.

993
00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:54.680
ancient by movie star standards

994
00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:58.040
and I wasn't gonna sit around
waiting for the next script.

995
00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:00.760
that would go to
Julie Christie anyway.

996
00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:07.920
So. I started to
appear in horror films.

997
00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:20.600
Molly?

998
00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:24.160
These were the good years

999
00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:27.840
and I even agreed to a
role in "The Persuaders"

1000
00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:30.240
with my old friend Roger Moore.

1001
00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:33.280
mainly because it was being
filmed on the French Riviera.

1002
00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:34.280
which I adore.

1003
00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:39.880
In England. life was perfect.

1004
00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:44.120
Then out of the blue.
Ron announced that
we had to upsticks

1005
00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:49.000
and move back to California.
I knew it was a bad idea.

1006
00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:52.280
Ron was about to head a
new film company in LA.

1007
00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:56.240
so with a heavy heart.
I said. bye. bye Britain

1008
00:53:56.320 --> 00:54:00.320
and moved back lock. stock
and Mercedes to LA again.

1009
00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:08.960
And then. sadly.
Ron lost his job.

1010
00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:15.560
I was now the sole breadwinner
of this rather large family.

1011
00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:19.880
I was working in television

1012
00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:22.240
and we didn't socialise
as much as we used to.

1013
00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:26.360
I told Ron that I really
wanted to move by to England.

1014
00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:28.520
LA wasn't good for our kids.

1015
00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:32.200
not to mention it was terrible
for my ego. Ron refused.

1016
00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:37.640
We were fighting a lot.
usually about money.

1017
00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:40.920
Would you accept it
and say a successful.

1018
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:44.000
conventional marriage. that
the man should be the boss?

1019
00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:47.880
What'd you call a successful.
conventional marriage?

1020
00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:56.760
We managed to get by. I guest
starred on several TV shows.

1021
00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:58.920
including "Police Woman."

1022
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.240
You mind if I smoke?

1023
00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:01.080
Yes. I do.

1024
00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:04.440
Well. it's too bad.

1025
00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:06.960
Police. freeze!

1026
00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:08.520
But that didn't
cut it financially.

1027
00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:10.520
not with six kids to support.

1028
00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:15.240
My friend. Samantha Egger.

1029
00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:18.120
with whom I'd worked
on "Starsky and Hutch."

1030
00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:21.720
suggested that I apply
for unemployment benefit.

1031
00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:32.360
So. one sunny afternoon in 1976.

1032
00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:36.400
I reluctantly drove out to
the Department of Unemployment

1033
00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:37.680
in Santa Monica.

1034
00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:43.120
Then I'm saying that I'll
kill Samantha for this.

1035
00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:44.680
this was really the
wrong thing to do

1036
00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:46.680
and I finally got to
the head of the line

1037
00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:49.960
and the woman's looked at my
name and says "Joan Collins!"

1038
00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:52.560
And the whole of the room
looked around and she goes.

1039
00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:54.680
"What're you doing here?"

1040
00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:57.240
So she said "Fill out
this form. Ms. Collins."

1041
00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:59.440
and people coming up saying.
"Can I have your autograph?"

1042
00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:02.000
"Fill out this form and
come back next week."

1043
00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:03.800
I said. "You mean I
don't get the $180 now?"

1044
00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:05.120
She said. "No. next week."

1045
00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:06.440
So I said. "Thank
you very much."

1046
00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:07.680
I took the form and
I never went back.

1047
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.560
At this point. I hear
you probably ask.

1048
00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:13.160
"Why didn't they
just sell the house

1049
00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:15.360
and live a simple life?"

1050
00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:19.240
Well. since I hadn't lived a
simple life since I was 20.

1051
00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:22.760
I wasn't about to start
now and I needed a job

1052
00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:28.520
and what I got was
"Empire of The Ants."

1053
00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:36.960
This film was not going
to win any of us an Oscar.

1054
00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:38.760
in fact. it seemed
more of a certainty

1055
00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:40.360
that it would guarantee

1056
00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:42.520
that none of us would
ever work again.

1057
00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:48.000
I was the so-called
star of this epic.

1058
00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:52.360
And although we'd been
promised stunt doubles.

1059
00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:53.880
they hadn't arrived.

1060
00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:58.480
so four petrified actors
capsized into the filthy water.

1061
00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:04.560
Now Florida swamps are
infested with crocodiles.

1062
00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:06.840
snakes and all kinds of bugs.

1063
00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:11.600
I tried to keep my head
above the loathsome liquid

1064
00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:15.080
as snake like tentacles
attached themselves to my legs

1065
00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:19.560
and when I scrambled out. they
were bleeding from deep cuts.

1066
00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:22.920
A few days later. the
cuts began to fester.

1067
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:24.760
"Terrific!" I thought.

1068
00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:27.440
not only have I possibly
wrecked my career

1069
00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:29.560
by doing this piece of drick.

1070
00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:32.400
but I probably contracted
some fatal disease

1071
00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:34.440
and will have to have
my legs amputated.

1072
00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:40.680
I looked and felt a wreck
and was never so delighted

1073
00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:43.280
as when the last day
of shooting arrived

1074
00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:47.680
and it was finally my turn by
some forgettable plot twist

1075
00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:51.280
to be asphyxiated by
the giant queen ant

1076
00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:53.240
and turned into a zombie.

1077
00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:03.320
And that. I am happy to say.
was my last horror film.

1078
00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:06.680
But that also became a cult.

1079
00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:16.920
Hello!

1080
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.760
I promoted "Empire of The Ants"

1081
00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:20.400
at the Canne Film Festival.

1082
00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:25.600
At a lunch. I was seated next
with distributor of B films

1083
00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:27.240
in the UK.

1084
00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:29.480
"Would you be interested
in making a movie

1085
00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:32.760
from my sister Jackie's best
selling novel "The Stud?"

1086
00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:36.440
Okay. so let's rewind.

1087
00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:38.040
My sister. Jackie.

1088
00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:41.920
had just written a wonderful
book called "The Stud"

1089
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.800
and there was a character in
it called Fontaine Khaled.

1090
00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:46.800
a glamorous socialite.

1091
00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:49.880
however. slightly
nymphomaniacal jet setter.

1092
00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:53.360
She originally came
to me and said.

1093
00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:55.960
could she have the book

1094
00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:57.160
because she thought it was
a wonderful part for her

1095
00:58:57.240 --> 00:58:58.480
and it is a wonderful
part for her.

1096
00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:00.640
Who knows about
the lights. please?

1097
00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:02.760
My career was going
slowly nowhere.

1098
00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:04.040
I was just doing horror films

1099
00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:06.280
and doing bits in
television in America

1100
00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:08.640
and I realised that I had
to put myself in a film

1101
00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:10.000
that was very
commercial otherwise.

1102
00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:11.600
I would probably
never work again.

1103
00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:15.880
So I asked Jackie if she
would write the script

1104
00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:19.200
and that I could then start
taking it to various producers

1105
00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:21.720
and to various people that
I knew to get it financed.

1106
00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:26.520
I had taken it around to
every producer I knew.

1107
00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:28.680
but no one was interested.

1108
00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:30.520
And here I was again at Canne.

1109
00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:34.840
offering my. by now.
slick opening pitch.

1110
00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:37.600
would this man sitting
next to me be interested?

1111
00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:41.760
"As a matter of fact. I would!"
said burley George Walker.

1112
00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:44.680
ex-boxer and now low
budget film producer.

1113
00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:47.400
"That's just the kind of
movie we're interested in!"

1114
00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:51.600
The search for an
actor to play the stud

1115
00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:53.160
became as close to the search

1116
00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:56.240
for Scarlett O'Hara
as we could make it.

1117
00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:58.760
Adam Faith and George
Best were mentioned.

1118
00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:00.720
even Tom Jones was.

1119
01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:03.400
who actually appeared
most anxious to play it.

1120
01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:11.520
Finally. we chose the darkly
brooding. sexy Oliver Tobias.

1121
01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:13.240
Why?

1122
01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:15.360
You'll reek of sex anyway.
it's your main attribute.

1123
01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:18.800
And within months. we
were in production.

1124
01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.880
I was going to star in the film

1125
01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:25.000
with the proviso I do
some tasteful nudity.

1126
01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:29.120
Yes. I could do that. this
was no longer the dark ages.

1127
01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:31.600
It's a nice coat. is it new?

1128
01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:33.600
This?

1129
01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:35.680
No. I've had it for hours.

1130
01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:39.320
Jesus!

1131
01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:40.640
I realised that if
you're gonna make a film

1132
01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:43.040
called "The Stud."
you are copping out

1133
01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:45.720
if you are not showing scenes

1134
01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:48.160
in which you see a
certain amount of flesh.

1135
01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:49.880
That's right.

1136
01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:02.880
Tonight.

1137
01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:05.120
Ian Wooldridge talks to
film actress. Joan Collins.

1138
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.680
Joan. you know as you sit there.

1139
01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:11.160
being who you are
and what you are

1140
01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:14.280
and looking. if I
may say so. gorgeous.

1141
01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:17.200
that millions of men would
love to jump into bed with you.

1142
01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:19.320
does that give you a
feeling of great power?

1143
01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:24.960
I bore the
brunt of sizzling fury

1144
01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:26.680
as though a woman over 40.

1145
01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:30.040
semi-nude was something
truly shocking.

1146
01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:32.840
You appear naked in the film.

1147
01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:34.560
Mm-hmm.

1148
01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.280
Some people might think this
was. you know. overexposure.

1149
01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:37.840
I think I'm right in saying

1150
01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:39.520
that that is the just about
the first British film

1151
01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:43.160
in which you really appeared
in a nude love scene.

1152
01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:44.800
Oh. I would say yes.

1153
01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:48.720
You. in fact. are a sex
symbol.. you accept that?

1154
01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:50.760
Well. I think that's
just part of what I am.

1155
01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:52.040
Raquel Welsh always reckons

1156
01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:54.840
that you should show
the public just so much

1157
01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:56.760
but if you show a lot.
they lose interest.

1158
01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:58.080
I mean. did you have
any misgivings?-

1159
01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:59.920
Ah. shes such a great
philosopher. Raquel.

1160
01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:02.920
Not so hard. Sandro.

1161
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.760
I didn't think I was committing
a crime by revealing my.

1162
01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:08.080
not-to-be-sneezed-at-body.

1163
01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:11.520
You see. I don't think
there's anything wrong

1164
01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:15.240
with being beautiful.
glamorous. well dressed.

1165
01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:17.400
well groomed or
sexually attractive.

1166
01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:21.920
If God was kind enough
to give you those things.

1167
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.720
then I think you might
as well appreciate them

1168
01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:28.880
and not hide your light
under a bushel. as it were.

1169
01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:31.560
Do you think that people
now say when they meet you.

1170
01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:33.400
they mentally undress you. say?

1171
01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:34.680
Not if they've already seen it.

1172
01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:36.000
why should they
want to do it again?

1173
01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:39.080
This is the peg that
you are hung up on

1174
01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:42.600
and I'm not desperately
trying to escape it. you see?

1175
01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:44.520
I'm not saying "No.
no. I'm not that.

1176
01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.160
I will now wear my dowdy skirts

1177
01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:47.960
and I will take off my makeup
and scrape back my hair."

1178
01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:50.160
I'm not going to do it
because I like the way I am.

1179
01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:54.200
And I discovered that my
tag of sultry. sexy bitch

1180
01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:58.000
was one that the public loved
and actually believed in.

1181
01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:59.560
Don't drop it. will you. lover.

1182
01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:03.160
Let's begin with Joan Collins.

1183
01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:04.600
I once read that
she was considered

1184
01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:06.480
to be the main female
object of desire

1185
01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.760
in a survey of teenage boys.

1186
01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:10.480
In a poll of English men.

1187
01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:12.240
I was voted the sexiest woman

1188
01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:14.240
in the world that year. hoorah!

1189
01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:18.240
Certainly. the British
audiences loved it.

1190
01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:21.640
I mean. I know some people
who saw it 36 times.

1191
01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:23.680
I know some people who saw
it four and five times.

1192
01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:26.320
and I would say that it
would be very successful.

1193
01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:27.440
touch wood.

1194
01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:30.080
And it was.

1195
01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:33.480
Joan Collins.
Oliver Tobias. "The Stud."

1196
01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:39.160
"The Stud"
was a giant success.

1197
01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:41.480
the biggest money in
Britain at that time.

1198
01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:43.080
other than the Bond films.

1199
01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:45.600
so now I was a
household name again.

1200
01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:48.680
Oh. can't you smell
those Italian wines!

1201
01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:50.520
So fused with
herbs and spices

1202
01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:51.520
from four continents.

1203
01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.000
Oh. I'm being boring.

1204
01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:54.240
Oh. sorry!

1205
01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:55.880
I made a series of
commercials for Cinzano

1206
01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:57.280
with Leonard Rossiter.

1207
01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:58.080
Getting your head down. sweetie?

1208
01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.920
Jolly good idea.

1209
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.560
And he was such a
brilliant comedian

1210
01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:04.320
that my main problem was to
stop shrieking with laughter.

1211
01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:08.480
From the
same stable as "The Stud"

1212
01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:11.520
now comes "The Bitch."

1213
01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:14.160
"The Bitch." I
never liked that title.

1214
01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:16.560
"The Bitch."
another million plus investment

1215
01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:19.840
and another limousine ride to
a premier with Joan Collins.

1216
01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:25.960
Ms. Collins sweeps in to play
her very professional part

1217
01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:29.000
in the razzmatazz which will
get the film talked about

1218
01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:32.720
and sold to the public. no
matter what the critics say.

1219
01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:38.880
Then I've got a dream
deal with British Airways.

1220
01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:43.000
one commercial and free
travel for three years!

1221
01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:44.720
There's a sort of
Renaissance here.

1222
01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:47.960
I think the seventies
were a bad time

1223
01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.080
and I think that the eighties
are going to be tremendous.

1224
01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:50.960
I hope.

1225
01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:59.640
On August the first
1980. I flew to Paris.

1226
01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:02.280
the following day. the
unthinkable happened.

1227
01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:07.320
my daughter. Katy. had been
in a terrible accident.

1228
01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:11.840
Even now. it's hard for
me to talk about it.

1229
01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:13.920
Well. she was
knocked down by a car

1230
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.160
and sustained very
serious brain injuries

1231
01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:21.080
and I was told that
she was going to die

1232
01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:25.920
and then she was in a
coma for a very long time.

1233
01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:28.480
You and your husband
got a mobile home

1234
01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:30.000
outside the hospital
and spent all this time

1235
01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:32.080
talking with her
and being with her.

1236
01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:35.760
Yes. the only way that I
was able to really cope

1237
01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:39.760
was by almost pretending
that it wasn't happening.

1238
01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:42.360
that it was like.
happening to somebody else.

1239
01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:45.840
Eventually she started
to make little sounds

1240
01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:49.960
and then she took her
first faltering steps.

1241
01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:52.920
She was going to be all right.

1242
01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:56.640
Katy's accident
was the worst thing

1243
01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:57.840
that ever happened to me.

1244
01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:05.000
I took Kay on
holiday to Marbella.

1245
01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:07.600
she still had a way to
go for complete recovery.

1246
01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:10.280
but she was thriving
in the sunshine.

1247
01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:13.240
I'd been begging Ron to
sell the house in LA.

1248
01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:14.920
we really needed the money.

1249
01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:18.880
Despite the success of
"The Stud" and "The Bitch."

1250
01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:21.480
George Walker was
refusing to pay my share

1251
01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.800
of the video sales.
which were huge.

1252
01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:28.880
One day. my brother discovered
a tonne of unpaid bills

1253
01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:31.760
in Ron's desk and documents

1254
01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:36.000
that showed that we had a
huge mortgage on the house.

1255
01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:40.120
I flew to LA to find out that
our car had been impounded.

1256
01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:42.120
People were calling to be paid.

1257
01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:44.560
including our cleaning
lady and the gardener.

1258
01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:46.360
it was a nightmare.

1259
01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:52.720
And then the phone
rang. it was my agent.

1260
01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:55.400
"Joany. have you ever
heard of "Dynasty?""

1261
01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:57.440
"No. never. what's "Dynasty?""

1262
01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:01.280
"It's a bit like Dallas. they
want you. it's a great role.

1263
01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:06.120
her name is Alexis. she's a
bitch but brilliantly smart."

1264
01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:11.120
"Okay. I'll think
about it." so I did.

1265
01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:13.160
I mean. I'd never
heard of the show.

1266
01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:14.760
it hadn't played in England.

1267
01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:18.960
it was about sort of 35 or
45 on the ratings in America.

1268
01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.160
it wasn't terribly successful.

1269
01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:28.080
These opening credits
are still thrilling.

1270
01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:32.960
I never have actually wanted
to do a series particularly

1271
01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:34.680
and they had to sort of
twist my arm to do it

1272
01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:36.000
and a lot of the
reason why I did it

1273
01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:38.440
was because I felt that
being in California

1274
01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:40.360
for six months with Katy.

1275
01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:41.840
rather than being in
the English winter.

1276
01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:43.120
would be very beneficial.

1277
01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:48.480
That six months turned
into nine years.

1278
01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:54.160
I think that. you
know. like any role.

1279
01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:56.320
you're always the
second or third choice

1280
01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:00.400
and I think they wanted
Elizabeth Taylor or Sophia Loren

1281
01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:02.400
or Raquel Welch. I don't know.

1282
01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:03.680
there was a whole bunch people

1283
01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:05.640
that were mentioned
before me. but I got it.

1284
01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:11.320
Season two. episode one.

1285
01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:15.800
my first day of filming.
enter Alexis Carrington.

1286
01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:20.640
Would you state your
full name please?

1287
01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:22.720
Alexis Morell-Carrington.

1288
01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:25.200
And your residence?

1289
01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:28.040
Alexis is the mysterious
ex-wife of oil tycoon.

1290
01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:29.160
Blake Carrington.

1291
01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:31.400
who is on trial for the murder

1292
01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:34.520
of his son's homosexual lover.

1293
01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:37.480
Alexis is the surprise witness.

1294
01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:39.920
I was very young when I
married Mr. Carrington.

1295
01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:43.400
At first. it was a good
marriage in every sense.

1296
01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:45.680
we had an excellent
relationship.

1297
01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:48.320
But I knew it was me
that was really on trial.

1298
01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:51.040
Okay. here's this
actress from England.

1299
01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:52.760
now show us what you can do.

1300
01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:58.560
I'm glad to see that your
father had your teeth fixed.

1301
01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:00.440
if not your tongue.

1302
01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:05.000
I had convinced the producers

1303
01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:08.080
to let me play the stylish
Alexis as an English woman.

1304
01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:11.680
"Little America won't
understand you!" said my agent.

1305
01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:13.360
I be your pardon?

1306
01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:16.880
"Yes. they will!" I argued.
"I have perfect good diction!"

1307
01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:19.680
I'd like to please a phone
call to Paris. please.

1308
01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:20.840
Yes. the one in France.

1309
01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:26.600
I realised that Alexis could
be viewed as somewhat cliched.

1310
01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:28.840
but there was enough
humour in her lines

1311
01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:31.880
for me to build an
interesting character.

1312
01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:34.560
Nobody takes me to the cleaners
and to bed in the same day.

1313
01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:36.680
Mr. Dexter. good night.

1314
01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:39.440
So I go off to go in this series

1315
01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:42.480
and have become. in a
period of three months.

1316
01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:44.560
the most hated
woman on television.

1317
01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:47.160
Get out of my sight.
you miserable has been.

1318
01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:48.760
Of course. if you've seen
Joan Collins on that show.

1319
01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:51.360
you know who put the
nasty in "Dynasty." right?

1320
01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:53.840
What a dump.

1321
01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:55.600
And all these little
kids were waving at me

1322
01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:57.440
from a station waggon
and they were waving

1323
01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:59.160
and waving like that. they
were about seven or eight

1324
01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:02.240
and so I sort of waved
back and I said "Hello!"

1325
01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:04.320
They said "Hello.
Alexis. Alexis!

1326
01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:05.760
We hate you!"

1327
01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:07.480
Now listen to me.
you little tramp.

1328
01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:10.400
Did you ever say to them.
"This is lousy dialogue?"

1329
01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:11.680
Constantly!

1330
01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:13.080
Oh. that's all I
was ever saying.

1331
01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:14.960
I said. "How can I say this?"

1332
01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:16.480
And they said. "Well
rewrite it." so I did.

1333
01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:19.000
Yes. she's strong. she's
assertive and she's a big bitch

1334
01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:20.520
but that's okay.

1335
01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:23.520
"Being bad is good
business for Joan Collins."

1336
01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:26.480
Oh. Daddy saying.

1337
01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:29.960
"I'm so proud of my sexy.
superbitch daughter."

1338
01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:31.720
He would never have
said those words.

1339
01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:34.680
"Rise of the superbitch."

1340
01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:36.960
Oh yes. the superbitch.

1341
01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:39.960
I don't know made this
book. it's not my writing.

1342
01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:42.760
I think at one point I
had three secretaries.

1343
01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:47.200
A lot of the reason that women
admire her is that she says.

1344
01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:49.320
"This is what I'm going to do

1345
01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:50.920
and nothing's going to stop me

1346
01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.880
and if a man can do
it. I can do it."

1347
01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:54.600
And she thinks like a man

1348
01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:56.480
and so people call her a
bitch a lot of the time

1349
01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:58.080
and actually she's just
being very business like.

1350
01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:00.120
very assertive. very tough.
very strong and saying.

1351
01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:01.720
"I'm gonna do this!"

1352
01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:04.040
How do you get that
reputation of being a bitch?

1353
01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:07.840
I was kind of upset at first
when I first came to America

1354
01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:09.680
and everybody thought
that I was this

1355
01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:11.640
and then I just thought
there's nothing I can do.

1356
01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:12.880
take the money and run

1357
01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:13.960
and let them think
you're the biggest bitch

1358
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.920
in kingdom come!

1359
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.480
"Dynasty." which had been
languishing in the ratings.

1360
01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:21.360
began to climb to the top.

1361
01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:25.840
Oh. this is really a good one.

1362
01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:27.760
John Forsythe. of course.
always in the middle.

1363
01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:29.400
in his contract.

1364
01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:31.920
he always had to be in
the top or in the middle.

1365
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.200
"At "Dynasty."
"Dallas" shoot out.

1366
01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:38.440
panic on "Dallas" as
"Dynasty's" ratings soar."

1367
01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:39.360
I like that.

1368
01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:45.560
And that. my darling. is
how it should be done.

1369
01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:49.920
And that's Alexis for you.
steely but with panache.

1370
01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:53.760
When the producers realised

1371
01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:58.600
that fights between Alexis
and her arch enemy. Crystal.

1372
01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:01.440
played by Linda Evans
were ratings gold.

1373
01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:04.760
they'd concoct at
least two every season.

1374
01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:07.120
You miserable bitch!

1375
01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:10.080
In one. we had to
fall into a lily pond

1376
01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:12.640
and fight like demented frogs.

1377
01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:15.120
Linda was supposed to
sock me in the jaw.

1378
01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:17.440
but freeze before connecting

1379
01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:22.320
so the stunt double could
take over. but she let rip.

1380
01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:25.840
She had a right hook
like Mike Tyson.

1381
01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:28.880
"Gee. I'm so sorry!" she said.

1382
01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:30.240
This was my house

1383
01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:32.600
while you were living
in a shack somewhere.

1384
01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:34.400
Alexis. if you don't
go down those stairs

1385
01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:37.280
and out that door. I'll
throw you out myself!

1386
01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:41.600
I wouldn't want you to
exert yourself. my dear.

1387
01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:43.000
I'm leaving.

1388
01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:46.800
150 million people
tuned in each week

1389
01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:48.680
to watch us slug it out.

1390
01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:51.600
I went from being practically
unknown in America

1391
01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:55.720
to becoming one of the most
popular actresses in the world.

1392
01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:05.360
When you think of sexy
television vixens.

1393
01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:07.920
my first guest
immediately comes to mind.

1394
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.240
And Joan Collins
joins us this morning

1395
01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:10.960
from Los Angeles.
good morning. Joan.

1396
01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:12.600
Well. hi.

1397
01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:14.920
The most talked about
lady in the world today.

1398
01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.320
We on?

1399
01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:18.320
And certainly one of
the most glamorous.

1400
01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:20.120
First off. I love you.

1401
01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:21.760
You're not so bad yourself.

1402
01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:23.960
Joan Collins was once called
a poor mans Elizabeth Taylor.

1403
01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:25.280
well no more.

1404
01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:26.960
Thank you boys.
I'll see you later.

1405
01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:29.320
One of the most talked about
women in the Western world.

1406
01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:30.320
Thank you.

1407
01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:32.160
Would you welcome Joan Collins.

1408
01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.440
It took her a
while to get there.

1409
01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:43.040
but ever since she
became Alexis Carrington.

1410
01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:44.680
Joan Collins has remained

1411
01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:48.440
one of the most commanding
presences on television.

1412
01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:55.200
Yes. Americans really
have been spending $10.000

1413
01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:57.800
for each of these
Joan Collins dolls.

1414
01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:00.480
I had the feeling I
might be a star again

1415
01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:04.720
when I was asked to take part
in "The Night of 100 Stars."

1416
01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:07.760
Backstage. my friend
Henry Winkler was filming.

1417
01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:11.080
There was so many
faces from my past.

1418
01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:14.440
I hadn't seen Betty Davis
since "The Virgin Queen"

1419
01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:16.760
and she was still
just as intimidating.

1420
01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:20.800
As we left. Roger
Moore patted my cheek.

1421
01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:22.640
"Fame at last. Joany."

1422
01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.240
Actress Joan Collins is the
latest star to be honoured

1423
01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:31.120
with a star on her own in
Hollywood's Walk of Fame.

1424
01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:34.880
In Germany. where it was
called "Der Denver-Clan."

1425
01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:41.400
I was known as Der Denver-Beast.

1426
01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:44.440
I'm the voice of Joan
Collins in "Denver Clan."

1427
01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:46.120
I'm very proud about it

1428
01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:48.640
because I think she's just
marvellous. she's great.

1429
01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:52.680
I was made into a wax work.

1430
01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:55.640
I turned on the Christmas
lights in Regent Street.

1431
01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:01.040
I've never seen
anything like this.

1432
01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:04.200
And best of all. I
won a Golden Globe.

1433
01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:05.440
Joan Collins.

1434
01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.680
This is a special award for me

1435
01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:16.360
because the last time
that I won an award

1436
01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:20.760
was for the most
promising actress of 1957.

1437
01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:23.560
so it's taken me a bit of time.

1438
01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:26.240
but I'm really happy
to have it. thank you.

1439
01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:29.400
It's a big kick. I have to
tell you. it's really a kick.

1440
01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:37.720
I mean. you were
huge. "Dynasty" was huge.

1441
01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:39.040
Well first of all.

1442
01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:40.680
it was the right show
for the right time.

1443
01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:44.760
it had beautiful
people. beautiful
clothes. beautiful sets.

1444
01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:48.000
real flowers. real caviar.

1445
01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:51.480
real anger behind the
scenes. from some of us.

1446
01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:55.880
The 1980s was the me decade.

1447
01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:58.520
The markets were trading bonds

1448
01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:00.360
with the bravado of Gordon Gekko

1449
01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:04.160
and the stock market
soared. obviously.

1450
01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:06.880
and people were making
lot. lot. lot of money

1451
01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:09.960
and investing it and
living the good life.

1452
01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:11.880
The 1980s was a great decade.

1453
01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:14.440
I don't care what
people say about it.

1454
01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:18.560
I don't care if they say it
was all greed and Gordon Gekko.

1455
01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:25.200
I love Gordon Gekko
and I miss it.

1456
01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:30.160
Joan knows how to make
money and ooh la la.

1457
01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:31.800
she knows how to spend it.

1458
01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:34.320
This house is a
house that I bought

1459
01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:37.920
just a year or two
after "Dynasty" started.

1460
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.920
Well actress Joan Collins
is following the footsteps

1461
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.240
of other top celebrities.

1462
01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:43.760
she has put her name on
a new line of perfume.

1463
01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:47.520
Something Scoundrel.
my favourite fragrance.

1464
01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:51.520
The Joan Collins
lingerie collection.

1465
01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:53.800
It was one long spending spree

1466
01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:56.760
and "Dynasty" echoed
it all on television.

1467
01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:00.640
Mr. President. how are you?

1468
01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:02.240
Very. very good Blake.

1469
01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:04.880
People clammered to be on
"Dynasty." even for a walk on.

1470
01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:07.160
Hi. hello.

1471
01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:08.760
Hello Alexis. it's
good to see you.

1472
01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:10.960
Good to see you. I haven't
seen since Portofino.

1473
01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:16.200
One day. the network received
a call from Donald Trump.

1474
01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:19.160
"I'd just love to have
a part on "Dynasty."

1475
01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:21.120
"Well. I'm afraid all
the roles are cast."

1476
01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:23.000
said the head of talent.

1477
01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:24.680
"But you don't understand.

1478
01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:27.680
I would be great as
one of Alexis' lovers."

1479
01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:31.240
The Alexis look
became the symbol

1480
01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:33.520
of the powerful eighties woman.

1481
01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:37.560
shoulder pads. couture and
lots and lots of bling.

1482
01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:41.640
Do you want to come in
and see me do my makeup?

1483
01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:43.480
Is that what you want?

1484
01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:46.160
During "The Stud." I
invented a makeup look

1485
01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:48.920
which I stuck to more
or less ever since.

1486
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.320
big hair. smokey eyes
and bright lipstick.

1487
01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:54.360
So when "Dynasty" came along.

1488
01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:58.160
the Alexis look was already
in place. it was mine.

1489
01:17:58.240 --> 01:17:59.680
Right. done.

1490
01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:03.480
By now. my picture
had been on the cover

1491
01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:07.600
of practically every magazine.
I was on top of the world.

1492
01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:10.480
but I'd been at
that rodeo before.

1493
01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:12.680
I knew full well that
it wouldn't last.

1494
01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:16.400
Everybody thought
that. you know.

1495
01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:18.760
I had the world on a string
and that I was playing this.

1496
01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:22.680
you know. tough. hard.
calculating woman but in life.

1497
01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:24.840
I was pretty miserable.

1498
01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:28.640
It was hard to keep up the
facade of being happy with Ron.

1499
01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:31.440
my closest friends saw
the marriage crumbling.

1500
01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:34.720
even if I refused to acknowledge
it openly at the time.

1501
01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:38.320
I went to a marriage
counsellor at one time

1502
01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:40.360
when I was married to Ron

1503
01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:42.000
because I really didn't want to.

1504
01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:44.800
I didn't wanna have
another failure.

1505
01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:49.240
but it just really
prolongs the agony.

1506
01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:50.800
We eventually did split up.

1507
01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:54.120
You've
had three marriages.

1508
01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:57.400
you had a sense of what
love is in those marriages

1509
01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:01.440
or you haven't achieved
what the classic love is.

1510
01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:02.680
What is the classic love?

1511
01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:04.000
Well. you know-

1512
01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:05.640
Romeo and Juliet?

1513
01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:06.280
Romeo and
Juliet. you know. whatever.

1514
01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:08.000
but no-

1515
01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:09.520
Well. yeah. the classic love
that lasts for about a year.

1516
01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:10.720
Is there-

1517
01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:12.240
That's what they had. if that.

1518
01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:13.720
Do you think Romeo and Juliet

1519
01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:15.880
would've stayed happily
married for 10 years?

1520
01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:19.040
Even when she had to do the
dishes and raise the children.

1521
01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:22.080
you think that love
would've stayed the same?

1522
01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:23.080
Of course not!

1523
01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:31.200
It was 1983 and that same
year I posed for Playboy.

1524
01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:36.320
Oh!

1525
01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:39.760
My God!

1526
01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:45.040
These are filth!

1527
01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:48.280
Okay. so Playboy.

1528
01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:49.960
Incidentally. Playboy.

1529
01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:51.840
you wanna see Joan Collins
without any clothes on?

1530
01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:54.000
Oh no!

1531
01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:56.000
Well now Joan Collins
has created quite a stir

1532
01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:57.640
by appearing in a photo layout

1533
01:19:57.720 --> 01:19:59.360
for the December
Playboy magazine.

1534
01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:01.760
the issue already looks to
be one of the top sellers

1535
01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:02.640
Playboy has ever had.

1536
01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:03.640
Did you see it?

1537
01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:04.440
Yes. I have seen it.

1538
01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:05.160
Did you all see it?

1539
01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:06.520
Yeah.

1540
01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:09.800
It's the only one
that I got paid for.

1541
01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:14.200
I had done hundreds of
magazine covers by that time

1542
01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:17.000
and since. but it's the
one that I got paid for.

1543
01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:18.400
probably the reason I did it.

1544
01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:23.520
One of the reasons that
I did the Playboy layout

1545
01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:25.240
was because I'm a feminist
and because I wanted to say.

1546
01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:29.560
"Hey. look. you don't have
to be 23 to be in Playboy.

1547
01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:32.000
you don't have to be
considered only attractive

1548
01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:33.680
if you're very young.

1549
01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:36.360
you can be attractive and you
can be sexy if you're older."

1550
01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:38.800
And I want other other
women who are older.

1551
01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:40.920
who are terrified
of getting older.

1552
01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.600
it's sick and frightening

1553
01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:45.640
how terrified women
are of getting older.

1554
01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:47.440
I like this picture
on the cover.

1555
01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:50.440
I think it's really
a very good picture

1556
01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:54.320
and it's glamorous without
being raunchy and nasty.

1557
01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:56.600
John Forsythe from
"Dynasty." loathed it.

1558
01:20:57.960 --> 01:20:59.760
He stormed into the
producer's office

1559
01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:02.440
in a classic Blake
Carrington rage

1560
01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:05.280
yelling "She's a disgrace
to our fine show!"

1561
01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:07.840
And just what do you
think you are doing here?

1562
01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:09.960
"Dynasty."

1563
01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:12.560
Accepting the
award for "Dynasty"

1564
01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:14.160
are Diahann Carroll.
Joan Collins-

1565
01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:17.280
Things came to head in 1986

1566
01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:20.440
when "Dynasty" won the
People's Choice Awards.

1567
01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:22.080
John was supposed to accept it

1568
01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:25.200
but the presenter
made a beeline for me

1569
01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:26.960
and plonked it in my hand.

1570
01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:29.640
Thank you. I know I
speak for all of us

1571
01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:31.760
when we say how thrilled we are.

1572
01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:33.480
John was furious and
hardly spoke to me

1573
01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:34.960
for the rest of the season.

1574
01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:37.680
And now I'm gonna give
it to the big boss.

1575
01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:38.880
You said it.

1576
01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:45.600
When it came to renegotiating
my "Dynasty" contract.

1577
01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:47.600
I found out that John Forsythe

1578
01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:52.240
was being paid much more than
me. I had to take a stand.

1579
01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:55.440
I realised that I had never
thought like a businesswoman.

1580
01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:59.200
I had thought like a
ding-a-ling sort of artiste.

1581
01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:01.720
I cannot be bothered
with things like money.

1582
01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:03.800
Now. if I had been a male actor

1583
01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:06.720
and had helped pull the
ratings up from nowhere

1584
01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:08.680
to number one in the world.

1585
01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:11.000
the networks would've been
falling over themselves

1586
01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:14.720
to give me parity
without me having to beg.

1587
01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:16.400
The British actress.
Joan Collins.

1588
01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:19.320
has been offered an extra
20.000 pounds a week

1589
01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:21.520
to go on playing the
arch villain Alexis

1590
01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:23.600
in the television
soap opera "Dynasty."

1591
01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:25.240
So don't underestimate me.

1592
01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:27.000
I'm not the same naive
little English girl

1593
01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:28.040
fresh out of boarding school

1594
01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:29.720
that you met all
those years ago.

1595
01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:31.360
I'm a very respected
businesswoman

1596
01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:32.680
and if you don't wanna
do business with me.

1597
01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:35.200
there are plenty of
other people who will.

1598
01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:37.520
I think I learned
a lot from Alexis

1599
01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:40.240
and her sharp business acumen.

1600
01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:41.920
If she accepts.

1601
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.040
it'll take her salary to
1.5 million pounds a year.

1602
01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:46.000
Finally.

1603
01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:59.600
Peter Holm was a tall.
blonde Scandinavian.

1604
01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:04.640
a sort of male version
of Britt Ekland.

1605
01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:07.720
I was. believe it
or not. a pop star

1606
01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:09.360
when I was about 20 years.

1607
01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:10.200
What was
the name of the group?

1608
01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:11.120
Me. Peter Holm.

1609
01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:19.880
I fell in love with him the
first time I saw him sing.

1610
01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:21.240
I did. didn't I?

1611
01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:22.200
He didn't speak
actually. you see.

1612
01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:23.960
I said "Does this man speak?"

1613
01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:25.280
And then somebody
sort of nudged him

1614
01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:27.440
and said "Get out
your guitar. Peter.

1615
01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:29.600
maybe she'll be impressed."

1616
01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:31.320
It worked. it worked instantly.

1617
01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:40.120
Big mistake.

1618
01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:43.360
After three
failed marriages.

1619
01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:45.320
she was resigned
to remaining single

1620
01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:48.160
until she saw Peter Holm
across a crowded restaurant

1621
01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:49.480
at a London lunch.

1622
01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:52.280
Today. Joan believes
there is such a thing

1623
01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:54.360
as a marriage made in heaven.

1624
01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:58.560
Joan Collins.

1625
01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:01.200
who's better known nowadays
as Alexis in "Dynasty"

1626
01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:04.240
has married for the fourth
time at the age of 52.

1627
01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:07.600
It didn't take long for
the problems to start.

1628
01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:09.840
It was almost a
sort of case history

1629
01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:13.200
of a very powerful.
successful woman

1630
01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:16.240
marrying a sort of man
who was not powerful

1631
01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:18.880
and not successful and
not really doing anything

1632
01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:21.080
and getting taken over.

1633
01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:22.920
He fired my agents and managers.

1634
01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:24.360
"You're famous. sweetie.

1635
01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:27.280
you don't need any
of these parasites!"

1636
01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:30.520
but then took 20% of my income.

1637
01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:31.840
"If I'm not here. sweetie.

1638
01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:33.920
you'll just go back
to your old ways

1639
01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.880
and these parasites will
just take and take and take."

1640
01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:41.600
None of my friends liked him.
but I stupidly didn't listen.

1641
01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:42.840
She's so sweet.

1642
01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:44.920
I had allowed the Swede

1643
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.240
to totally control
my business life.

1644
01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:51.720
His anger was venomous and
whenever he had fights.

1645
01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:53.920
he would sneer sarcastically.

1646
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.440
"If only people could
see the great Alexis now.

1647
01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:00.560
what a pathetic cry baby."

1648
01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:02.960
How often
have others exploited you?

1649
01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:05.600
Quite a bit.

1650
01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:07.560
It must seem pretty pathetic

1651
01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:10.000
that a successful
woman in her prime

1652
01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:12.960
should allow herself
to be so bullied.

1653
01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:16.080
The trouble was. I was
far too stubborn to admit

1654
01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:19.120
I'd made a terrible.
terrible mistake.

1655
01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:21.120
I faced him with it after
we'd been married. I said.

1656
01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:23.120
"You're a sociopath and
if you continue like this.

1657
01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:24.400
I will divorce you."

1658
01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:26.240
This is after a few
months. he said.

1659
01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:29.160
"You will look like the biggest
fool in the world." he said.

1660
01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:31.960
"Alexis getting divorced
after four months."

1661
01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:34.120
I said "I'm not Alexis. I'm Joan

1662
01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:36.720
and I married you because I
thought you were one thing

1663
01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:38.360
and you're another. and
if you continue like this.

1664
01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:39.360
I'm gonna divorce."

1665
01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:44.320
TV star Joan Collins
and husband. Peter Holm

1666
01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:46.640
will start airing their
dirty laundry in public today

1667
01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:48.760
when they're much publicised
divorce case begins

1668
01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:50.120
in a Los Angeles courtroom.

1669
01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:54.000
Peter Holm. Miss
Collins' fourth husband.

1670
01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:55.480
insists the British
actress should pay him

1671
01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:57.440
50.000 pounds a month.

1672
01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:58.800
The trial could
generate more heat

1673
01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:00.800
than some "Dynasty" scenes.

1674
01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:02.720
Earlier this month.
Mr. Holm locked himself

1675
01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:05.320
in the Hollywood Hills mansion
he shared with the actress

1676
01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:08.280
threatening to shoot anyone
who tried to evict him.

1677
01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.080
He said. "If you divorce me.
I'm going to destroy you.

1678
01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:11.680
I'm gonna take all your money."

1679
01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:13.240
And he threatened all of that
and he tried all of that.

1680
01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:14.600
Collins' attorney says

1681
01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:16.200
it's kind of like
any other divorce.

1682
01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:18.960
except his client's name
happens to be Joan Collins.

1683
01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:25.600
And finally. the judge allowed
him only $80.000. only?

1684
01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:27.520
Ha!

1685
01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:29.200
Joan. would
you ever marry again?

1686
01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:32.040
No. I said. "I don't need
a husband. I need a wife."

1687
01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:35.640
And that was
divorce number four.

1688
01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:44.200
Joan took the character
Alexis and ran with it.

1689
01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:46.840
it made her the most
watched woman on television

1690
01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:48.880
in more than 90 countries.

1691
01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:54.040
"Dynasty" had now brought
me fame and fortune

1692
01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:56.240
to a staggering degree.

1693
01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:57.760
On my last day on "Dynasty."

1694
01:26:57.840 --> 01:26:59.720
I ordered champagne for the crew

1695
01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:01.760
and a cake. which said

1696
01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:05.600
"It's been the best.
I love you all. Joan."

1697
01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:09.960
But I couldn't stop the
tears rolling down my cheeks.

1698
01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:27.720
As the nineties dawned.

1699
01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:31.400
outsized bling and big hair
were no longer in Vogue

1700
01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:34.560
and my life was branching
in a new direction.

1701
01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:36.360
I wouldn't have expected
you to be celibate

1702
01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:38.600
after we were divorced
anymore than I was.

1703
01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:39.960
What?

1704
01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:41.640
Ever since RADA. I'd
wanted to play Amanda

1705
01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:43.480
in Noel Cowards "Private Lives"

1706
01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:46.160
and now I finally had my chance.

1707
01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:48.120
The curtain dropped
to rapturous applause

1708
01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:51.320
for Joan Collins' first
night on the West End stage.

1709
01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:54.200
the star playing the lead in
Noel Coward's "Private Lives."

1710
01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:56.440
received a standing ovation.

1711
01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:59.600
I then co-produced and starred
in a series of Coward plays

1712
01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:01.240
for the BBC.

1713
01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:04.160
with a cast which included
my ex-husband Anthony Newley.

1714
01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:05.840
I couldn't help it!

1715
01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:07.800
It doesn't matter why you
did it or how you did it.

1716
01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:08.680
you did it!

1717
01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:10.360
All right. I did!

1718
01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:13.680
Tony and I drew heavily upon
our own marital experiences.

1719
01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:16.520
no method acting needed here.

1720
01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:18.520
but those years
were now behind us.

1721
01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:20.600
life's too short
to bear grudges.

1722
01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:24.960
Entree!

1723
01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:26.400
Ah. lovely!

1724
01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:27.760
Oh. look at this.

1725
01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:31.760
Welcome to my house. welcome.

1726
01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:35.440
That's our little pool.

1727
01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:37.520
Oh. look at that pool!

1728
01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:39.280
Oh. Joan!

1729
01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:40.920
It's nice. isn't it?

1730
01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.520
Like her sister. Jackie Collins.

1731
01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:45.040
Joan has turned her real
life experiences in Hollywood

1732
01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:47.720
into a hot new book
called "Prime Time."

1733
01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:48.920
This is the work area.

1734
01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:51.680
This is where I
write blockbusters

1735
01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:53.760
with my "Dictionary of English
Synonyms and Antonyms."

1736
01:28:58.880 --> 01:28:59.640
I lie here.

1737
01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:05.120
I hop on the telephone.
hello mother.

1738
01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:06.760
I said to Katy. who was then 14.

1739
01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:08.320
I said. "Are you going
to read "Prime Time?"

1740
01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:10.960
She said. "Mummy. I don't
read trash fiction."

1741
01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:14.760
The only award
Jane Collins might get

1742
01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:18.120
for her first novel is for
a record number of signings.

1743
01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:19.920
500 in an hour.

1744
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.480
"Prime Time" was a best seller
and so was my next book.

1745
01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:27.760
Every time I read this
book. and I have to say.

1746
01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:29.480
I've read it a few times.

1747
01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:33.360
I think it's such a good book.

1748
01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:37.600
My agent then got me a
staggering $2 million deal

1749
01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:41.320
to write two steamy
novels for Random House.

1750
01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:43.960
I delivered two novels
in a timely manner

1751
01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:49.160
and then Random House
decided to sue me.

1752
01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:51.240
The actress Joan
Collins took the stand

1753
01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:53.000
in a real courtroom drama.

1754
01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:55.040
she's defending her
literary reputation

1755
01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:57.040
after being sued
by her publishers

1756
01:29:57.120 --> 01:29:59.440
for the return of a
million dollar advance.

1757
01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:01.760
They say her efforts to
write steamy blockbusters

1758
01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:03.440
fell short at the mark.

1759
01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:06.680
I was locked into the
biggest fight of my life.

1760
01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:10.960
So you tell one story
when you're suing them

1761
01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:13.760
and you tell this jury another

1762
01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:15.880
when you're trying to keep
from returning the advance.

1763
01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:16.880
yes or no?

1764
01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:18.080
No. I haven't-

1765
01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:19.920
No. no is the answer.
next question.

1766
01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.440
Don't you have any shame?

1767
01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:23.760
Abstain. please. counsellor!

1768
01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:25.520
It was absolutely brutal.

1769
01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:27.240
The actress seemed
on the brink of tears

1770
01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:28.680
after that bruising session

1771
01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:31.000
and she turned away from
the courtroom camera.

1772
01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:33.840
"Don't let them rattle
you." My friend said.

1773
01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:38.520
"Be strong. just
be. become Alexis."

1774
01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:44.400
The next day I walked
into the courtroom

1775
01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:47.400
and I became Alexis.

1776
01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:50.880
Don't get yourself into a
court fight with this woman.

1777
01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:53.440
Did you sometimes
call this "Athena?"

1778
01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:55.120
Sometimes I called it
"Hitler's mistress."

1779
01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:58.000
it went through so
many different names.

1780
01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:00.760
That is a pretty
good Alexis line.

1781
01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:04.040
Oh. Mr. Keller.

1782
01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:05.080
you're not supposed
to come close to me

1783
01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:07.160
without asking permission.

1784
01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:11.360
After two weeks. the jury filed
in to deliver the verdict.

1785
01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:13.400
A moment of
tension as Joan Collins

1786
01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:14.880
awaits the jury verdict

1787
01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:16.880
on whether she's broken
her book contract.

1788
01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:19.160
Did defendant Joan
Collins fail to deliver

1789
01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:21.000
a complete manuscript.
what is the answer?

1790
01:31:21.080 --> 01:31:22.400
No.

1791
01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:23.200
Was that unanimous?

1792
01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:24.040
Yes.

1793
01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:30.240
I'd won with a little
help from Alexis.

1794
01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:35.080
Justice had been served
and oh. how sweet it was.

1795
01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:36.840
The actress Joan
Collins is celebrating

1796
01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:38.080
her courtroom victory

1797
01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:40.880
over her American
publishers Random House.

1798
01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:43.560
That the 62-year-old
actress thanked the jury.

1799
01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:45.320
asked by one if they could keep

1800
01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:47.600
the copies of her
unpublished blockbuster.

1801
01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:48.960
"A Ruling Passion."

1802
01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:50.840
Ms. Collins offered
to autograph them.

1803
01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:55.120
11 Men and women who were
all college graduates.

1804
01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:57.160
who all. none of them
had seen "Dynasty."

1805
01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:59.760
none of them had read
my books. so they said!

1806
01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.840
And I think Random House
are trying to teach a lesson

1807
01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:05.400
to not only me. but
to other authors.

1808
01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:06.760
They don't wanna pay this.

1809
01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:08.720
but nobody held a
gun to their head

1810
01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:09.560
to give me all that money.

1811
01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:10.640
We love you!

1812
01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:17.800
Now. could it be fifth time
lucky for Joan Collins?

1813
01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:20.320
The 68-year-old
actress tied the knot

1814
01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:22.480
at London's Claridge's
hotel today.

1815
01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:23.920
her new and fifth husband.

1816
01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.960
Percy Gibson. is 32
years her junior.

1817
01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:30.520
The dress code
was. of course. glamorous.

1818
01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:32.960
sadly. a deal with the
celebrity magazine.

1819
01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:34.960
precluded a glimpse
of the bride.

1820
01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:36.240
Great and again.

1821
01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:38.240
hold for me. that's
fabulous. still.

1822
01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:40.160
Absolutely love it.
yeah. look at that!

1823
01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:50.680
I first set eyes on Percy
Gibson in the year 2000.

1824
01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:53.520
he was managing a
theatre production

1825
01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:54.760
that I was going to be in.

1826
01:32:56.840 --> 01:32:59.840
The fact that I was older
didn't matter to us.

1827
01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:02.200
it was giddy. it was fantastic

1828
01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:04.960
and Percy and I
fell madly in love.

1829
01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:07.560
I. Joan Henrietta Collins.

1830
01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:10.320
Do take thee. Percy
Michael Gibson.

1831
01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:13.160
Do take thee. Percy
Michael Gibson.

1832
01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:16.040
To be my
lawful. wedded husband.

1833
01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:18.360
To be my lawful. wedded husband.

1834
01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:22.000
We been together ever since.

1835
01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:26.320
I finally found my true
soulmate and my husband forever.

1836
01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:32.480
Dame Joan Collins
for services to charity.

1837
01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:36.960
In 2015. I received one of the
greatest honours of my life.

1838
01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:38.600
a dame hood.

1839
01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:39.880
Dame Joan Collins.

1840
01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:41.760
I can't say it enough.
Dame Joan Collins.

1841
01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:44.680
Oh. I love it. thank you.

1842
01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:47.040
I know I've had a lucky life.

1843
01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:50.000
but I think I've also had
my fair share of disaster

1844
01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:51.240
and unhappiness.

1845
01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:56.840
And there have been three
miserable. horrible divorces.

1846
01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:59.520
Dame Joan Collins.

1847
01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:02.280
The terrible situation when
my daughter almost died.

1848
01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:05.160
bankruptcy. almost.

1849
01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:10.040
not getting any work
as an actor. a lot.

1850
01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:12.920
Dame Joan
Collins everyone!

1851
01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:16.040
But who wants reality?

1852
01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:18.400
There's already too much
of it in today's world.

1853
01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:21.520
And as they say
in show business.

1854
01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:23.640
that's not what
the public pay for.

1855
01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:29.560
That is a wrap for Joan Collins!

1856
01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:37.440
I think people like the glamour
girl called Joan Collins.

1857
01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:39.960
Off we go!

1858
01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:43.720
Even if they understand
glamour is just an illusion.

1859
01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:55.160
Is that it?

1860
01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:56.560
Are we done?

1861
01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:04.240
I don't suppose we could
open the window for a second

1862
01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:06.200
or put it on some AC?

1863
01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:09.000
'Cause maybe I shouldn't
wear a sweater.

1864
01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:13.440
I think maybe I shouldn't
wear this sweater.

1865
01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:14.840
does it look okay?

1866
01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:16.120
You look great.

1867
01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:17.560
But I'm boiling.

1868
01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:22.120
'Cause I'm gonna take the books

1869
01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:24.200
and when I look at them.
I'm gonna put them here.

1870
01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:25.600
is that all right?

1871
01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:28.480
All right. we'll
just do that then.
