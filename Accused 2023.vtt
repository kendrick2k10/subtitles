doesn't mean there's been no progress.

'Cause I don't get it.

01:03:38.291 --> 01:03:39.875
We… we need to call the pol--

842
01:03:39.958 --> 01:03:42.333
Uh. we need to call the police. okay?
Yeah.

843
01:03:42.916 --> 01:03:44.958
Right. No. no. no.
Don't you call the police.

844
01:03:45.041 --> 01:03:48.791
Because by the time they get here.
you'll be dead from hypothermia.

845
01:03:48.875 --> 01:03:51.666
You'll dry yourself with those towels.
put on that dry sweater.

846
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:53.291
and I'll go and make us a cup of tea.

847
01:03:53.375 --> 01:03:56.750
Put on the clothes. and I'll drive you
to the police station myself.

848
01:03:59.083 --> 01:04:00.041
Okay?

849
01:04:00.583 --> 01:04:01.541
Okay.

850
01:04:04.666 --> 01:04:08.208
I-- I'm sorry for-- for waking you

851
01:04:08.291 --> 01:04:10.958
and just bringing all this shit
to your door.

852
01:04:11.041 --> 01:04:13.833
You're all right.
Sure. wasn't asleep anyway.

853
01:04:13.916 --> 01:04:16.291
I potter around at night
with the radio on.

854
01:04:16.958 --> 01:04:20.125
This bombing. awful business.

855
01:04:20.208 --> 01:04:21.458
Do you take sugar?

856
01:04:21.541 --> 01:04:22.625
Uh. s-- sorry?

857
01:04:22.708 --> 01:04:25.500
-In your tea. Do you take sugar?
-Uh. no. No. thank you.

858

861
01:04:46.916 --> 01:04:49.791
-[man 1 on radio] …about town…
-[Ms. Daly] Right. What did he say?

862
01:04:49.875 --> 01:04:53.375
-[man 2] Mm. that was a close call.
-[man 1] Doesn't bear thinking about.

863
01:04:53.458 --> 01:04:57.541
Uh. now. we haven't seen
any arrests made yet.

864
01:04:57.625 --> 01:05:01.083
However. there's been quite the buzz
on social media

865
01:05:01.166 --> 01:05:02.666
regarding the whole situation.

866
01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:04.541
Uh. you'll remember earlier on.

867
01:05:04.625 --> 01:05:07.666
the police put out a call
for help from the public…

868
01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:08.625
Milk and no sugar.

869
01:05:08.708 --> 01:05:11.416
…that seems to have really rallied
the whole country together.

870
01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:15.458
It seems as if the Internet may have done
what the police could not do

871
01:05:15.541 --> 01:05:17.791
and named the suspect.

872
01:05:17.875 --> 01:05:21.041
[man 1] Right. If you've been anywhere
on social media in the past few hours…

873
01:05:21.125 --> 01:05:24.875
-Hm. I'll just leave the teabag in.
-…you will know the name Harri Bhavsar.

874
01:05:24.958 --> 01:05:28.291
[man 2] It's trending all over.
Harri Bhavsar. yes.

-[Ms. Daly] No sugar. it's the blue one.
-[Harri] Thanks.

885
01:06:20.583 --> 01:06:24.541
So. uh. these men you said were after you.

886
01:06:25.291 --> 01:06:26.666
Two. I think.

887
01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:28.625
And they had weapons. you say?

888
01:06:29.375 --> 01:06:32.958
Yeah. Bats. hammers.
I-- I don't know what else.

889
01:06:33.041 --> 01:06:36.291
And do you think they're still

890
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:40.625
I don't know.

891
01:06:40.708 --> 01:06:44.583
Ms. Daly. maybe-- Let's just forget
the tea. and let's just-- let's just go.

892
01:06:44.666 --> 01:06:46.333
No. no. You stay where you are.

893
01:06:46.416 --> 01:06:47.625
-You'll be hungry. so.
-No. no--

894
01:06:47.708 --> 01:06:50.625
I'll get you some biscuits.
Don't you move a muscle now.

895
01:06:50.708 --> 01:06:51.833
I'll get you biscuits.

896
01:06:52.416 --> 01:06:54.666

01:07:40.625 --> 01:07:45.416
Oh. that's nice. Must be nice
to skip. you know. gray old England.

904
01:07:46.625 --> 01:07:50.458
Have they gone back home?
What country are you from. Harri?

905
01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:59.125
Ms. Daly. I think. um…
I think it's time we just got going.

906
01:08:01.375 --> 01:08:02.500
But you're wet.

907
01:08:02.583 --> 01:08:03.916
To the police station?

908
01:08:05.166 --> 01:08:06.541
Why are you so wet?

909
01:08:07.583 --> 01:08:10.291
Uh-- I fell in the pool. Uh…

[gasps] What happened to you?

920
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
You were such a lovely boy.

Listen to me.

929
01:09:09.125 --> 01:09:11.416
I didn't survive
what I went through in Belfast

930
01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:15.750
to come here and be taken advantage of
and lied to by you.

01:15:39.458 --> 01:15:42.083
-Say sorry. Say fucking sorry!
-I didn't fucking do it!

1013
01:15:42.166 --> 01:15:44.125
You killed fucking Jack.
though. didn't you?

1014
01:15:44.208 --> 01:15:45.625
[sobbing] I didn't…

1015
01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000

1019
01:16:19.250 --> 01:16:20.708
Why you runnin'. Harri?

1020
01:16:21.791 --> 01:16:23.041
Nowhere to go. lad.

1021
01:16:46.916 --> 01:16:48.458

[Harri] Please--
Please. just let-- Please--

1027
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:31.708
[loud creaking]

1028
01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:34.708
[man] Look at you. Pathetic.

1029
01:17:35.833 --> 01:17:37.166
[creaking continues]

1030
01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:39.166
Got you now. you little fuckin' prick.

[man wheezing]

1035
01:18:25.416 --> 01:18:26.416
I don't want to die.

1036
01:18:27.375 --> 01:18:29.791
No. no. don't-- don't go.
Don't go. please. please.

1037
01:18:29.875 --> 01:18:32.041
Please don't go. Please don't.

1038
01:18:35.208 --> 01:18:36.083
Stop!

1039
01:18:38.041 --> 01:18:39.625

-Please!

01:18:45.458 --> 01:18:46.791
[man chokes]

1041
01:18:52.541 --> 01:18:55.541
[screaming] Help!

1042

[breathing shakily]

1048
01:19:36.125 --> 01:19:37.500
[Chloe] Harri. hey. um…

1049
01:19:37.583 --> 01:19:38.583
[sobbing]

1050
01:19:38.666 --> 01:19:42.708
Uh. I-- I've been trying to call you
all night. but I can't get through.

1051
01:19:43.458 --> 01:19:46.333
I'm-- I'm really sorry about earlier.

1052
01:19:46.416 --> 01:19:47.958
The things they're saying about you--

1053
01:19:48.041 --> 01:19:52.625
You're right. It's gone way too far.
and it's all bullshit. It's all lies.

1054
01:19:52.708 --> 01:19:56.375
And… I don't know why
I acted that way. and it's--

1055
01:19:56.458 --> 01:19:58.708
It was fucked up. and I'm so sorry.

1056
01:19:59.625 --> 01:20:02.666
I'm really. really. really worried
about you. Harri. Please--

1057
01:20:03.166 --> 01:20:05.583
Please just--
Just-- just call me back. please.

1058
01:20:06.583 --> 01:20:08.041
[sniffles]

1059
01:20:16.416 --> 01:20:17.791
Oh. fuck. what?

1060
01:20:17.875 --> 01:20:19.625
What the fuck-- What the f--

1061
01:20:20.541 --> 01:20:21.750
[sinister music]

1062
01:20:22.333 --> 01:20:23.958

[music thumping from car speakers]

1066
01:20:44.333 --> 01:20:46.333
[soft ambient music]

1067
01:21:00.166 --> 01:21:03.541
Thank you. John. Well. this morning police
apprehended and took into custody

1068
01:21:03.625 --> 01:21:06.958
a 28-year-old man who is believed
to be responsible for the London bombing

1069
01:21:07.041 --> 01:21:08.958
which took place yesterday morning.

1070
01:21:09.041 --> 01:21:11.458
Paul Lock has been described
by those who knew him

1071
01:21:11.541 --> 01:21:15.125
as "harmless" and "a kind. gentle soul."

1072
01:21:15.208 --> 01:21:17.333
With his motive for the attack
still unclear.

1073
01:21:17.416 --> 01:21:19.833
speakers in the wider London community
are now asking

1074
01:21:20.333 --> 01:21:23.916
what could have pushed this man's
mental state to do such a terrible thing?

1075
01:21:24.666 --> 01:21:28.041
[man 1] That was David Lister
reporting live from central London.

1076
01:21:28.125 --> 01:21:30.833
So. can you tell us more about Paul Lock?

1077
01:21:30.916 --> 01:21:33.833
[man 2] Well. we've seen a statement
from one of his schoolteachers

1078
01:21:33.916 --> 01:21:36.916
who referred to him
as "quiet and reserved."

1079
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.833
They said they couldn't ever imagine
Paul acting like this.

1080
01:21:39.916 --> 01:21:42.833
It's just so far
from the realm of possibility.

1081
01:21:42.916 --> 01:21:46.375
And that follows on from several
other accounts by people who knew him.

1082
01:21:46.458 --> 01:21:49.416
[man 1] Mm. these stories about. uh.
Lock's manifesto.

1083
01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:51.166
which was unearthed hours ago.

1084
01:21:51.250 --> 01:21:53.500
has shown a different side to him.

1085
01:21:53.583 --> 01:21:57.291
The 30-page document was filled
with hate speech. threats.

1086
01:21:57.375 --> 01:22:01.666
and calls for action and justice
for a multitude of. as he claims.

1087
01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:04.833
"sins" the United Kingdom
is apparently guilty of.

1088
01:22:04.916 --> 01:22:05.750
[siren wailing]

1089
01:22:05.833 --> 01:22:09.750
We've no doubt seen a rise
in far-right ideology across Birmingham…

1090
01:22:09.833 --> 01:22:13.833
[man 3] This is for all those innocent
fuckin' people that you butchered.

1091
01:22:13.916 --> 01:22:15.500
Don't fuckin' look away!

1092
01:22:15.583 --> 01:22:18.208
Thank you. Harri. for having me here today

1093
01:22:18.291 --> 01:22:19.750
and speaking to me about this.

1094
01:22:19.833 --> 01:22:21.958
I know it must be
really difficult for you.

1095
01:22:22.583 --> 01:22:26.916
And it was only about a week ago today
that you were here in-- in this house

1096
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:31.041
and experiencing something that most of us
out there just couldn't imagine.

1097
01:22:31.125 --> 01:22:32.000
[birdsong]

1098
01:22:32.083 --> 01:22:34.791
Many of our listeners will no doubt have
heard about that day

1099
01:22:34.875 --> 01:22:38.333
you traveled home from London
to look after your family pet.

1100
01:22:38.416 --> 01:22:40.625
Yo-- your parents had left.

1101
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.041
and you were here alone
when people started accusing you online

1102
01:22:46.125 --> 01:22:48.458
of being behind the London bombings.

1103
01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:54.083
We can only guess how scared
you might have been in those moments. but…

1104
01:22:55.666 --> 01:22:59.125
only you know what it was like
when those two vigilantes

1105
01:22:59.208 --> 01:23:00.875
arrived outside your front door.

1106
01:23:01.708 --> 01:23:03.500
fueled by the witch hunt.

1107
01:23:03.583 --> 01:23:04.500
[crow caws]

1108
01:23:04.583 --> 01:23:08.000
They were convinced of a lie.
as so many people were.

1109
01:23:09.208 --> 01:23:10.500
Mmm--

1110
01:23:10.583 --> 01:23:12.500
It's all… [sighs]

1111
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.333
Just-- too much to bear thinking about.

1112
01:23:17.541 --> 01:23:20.125
And. uh. obviously.
you've been through a lot.

1113
01:23:20.208 --> 01:23:21.458
and yet…

1114
01:23:22.750 --> 01:23:24.625
Now that your name has been cleared

1115
01:23:25.583 --> 01:23:28.333
and the terrorist
has been taken off the streets.

1116
01:23:30.291 --> 01:23:33.041
a lot of people will have
forgotten your story.

1117
01:23:33.125 --> 01:23:34.875
-[rhythmic phone vibrations]
-Harri…

1118
01:23:35.875 --> 01:23:40.250
A lot of people will have assumed
that your life has gone back to normal.

1119
01:23:40.333 --> 01:23:42.333
[vibrations continue]

1120
01:23:44.916 --> 01:23:47.208
So. to start.

1121
01:23:48.541 --> 01:23:51.166
I want to know how you feel about that.

1122
01:23:51.250 --> 01:23:52.916
[vibrations continue]

1123
01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
[vibrations getting louder]

1124
01:24:12.208 --> 01:24:14.750
[somber. poignant music]
