3
00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:27.610
My husband and I worked
for everything I had.

4
00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.154
Don't come near me!

5
00:00:29.237 --> 00:00:30.739
Okay. okay.

6
00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.450
Okay. Hey. you don't wanna do this.

7
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:36.703
I don't know how I could be so stupid!

8
00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:39.039
Hey. hold on a second.
Give me your hand.

9
00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:43.126
I have nothing! Nothing!

10
00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:44.711
Sure. you do.

11
00:00:44.794 --> 00:00:46.755
Mrs. Feldman.
how about you take a step towards me?

12
00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:48.673
-We'll go inside and talk.

13
00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:51.342
I need a Crisis Response Unit here
right now.

14
00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:54.429
Get that chopper out of here!
No. no. no. no!

15
00:01:37.514 --> 00:01:38.765
Mmm.

16
00:01:41.976 --> 00:01:42.811
Hey. bear.

17
00:01:42.894 --> 00:01:43.895
Hey. baby.

18
00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:45.897
You gotta get up.

19
00:01:46.648 --> 00:01:48.441
<i> </i>I know.

20
00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:51.611
Is that rain?

21
00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:54.030
Yeah. it stopped about an hour ago.

22
00:01:55.573 --> 00:01:58.159
I left the keys on the table for you.
by the way.

23
00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.787
Baby. it's Tuesday.

24
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.414
You take your mom to the grocery store
on Tuesdays.

25
00:02:03.498 --> 00:02:04.791
Nah. it's...

26
00:02:04.874 --> 00:02:07.877
...it's fine. I told her
I'd come by later tonight. and...

27
00:02:08.586 --> 00:02:09.754
I just need to stay in.

28
00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:13.633
Are you okay?

29
00:02:14.425 --> 00:02:15.260
-Yeah.
-What's wrong?

30
00:02:15.343 --> 00:02:17.387
No. no. nothing. Nothing's wrong.

31
00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:18.805
Nothing's wrong.

32
00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:20.098
Take the car.

33
00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:21.766
Now. get up.

34
00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:27.147
Okay. well. you'll tell me later.
like you always do.

35
00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:28.898
I'll wait.

36
00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:32.402
-All right?
-Okay.

37
00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:05.059
<i> Now we're going</i>
<i>to move over to the Grace Waters case.</i>

38
00:03:05.143 --> 00:03:06.352
<i>Everyone's talking about it.</i>

39
00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:08.938
<i>The woman killed her husband. allegedly.</i>

40
00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:12.609
<i>Hold on. now.</i>
<i>Yes. we must say "allegedly."</i>

41
00:03:15.653 --> 00:03:18.072
<i>We have a population</i>
<i>of less than 100.000.</i>

42
00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:19.991
<i>Nothing like this</i>
<i>has ever happened before--</i>

43
00:03:20.074 --> 00:03:22.410
<i>But have you seen the reports from the DA?</i>

44
00:03:22.493 --> 00:03:24.746
<i>It's clear. She totally did it.</i>

45
00:03:33.254 --> 00:03:34.172
Jasmine.

46
00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:37.133
Coming.

47
00:03:44.515 --> 00:03:45.934
Here. Your next case.

48
00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:49.729
Grace Waters? I can't do this.

49
00:03:49.812 --> 00:03:51.272
Yeah. you can. and you will.

50
00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:53.775
She wants to plead guilty.
so this is completely easy.

51
00:03:53.858 --> 00:03:56.527
Go talk to her. talk to the DA.
get it worked out.

52
00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:58.738
get the plea done.
It's really high-profile.

53
00:03:58.821 --> 00:04:00.198
and we don't need it mishandled
or going to trial.

54
00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:02.033
What about giving it to Tilsa or Donnie?

55
00:04:02.116 --> 00:04:03.493
I mean. they are more...

56
00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:05.453
-...equipped to do this--
-You are doing it.

57
00:04:05.536 --> 00:04:06.829
We go through this all the time.

58
00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:08.706
You <i>can </i>do it.
Plea deals are your specialty.

59
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:09.999
She's adamant about pleading guilty.

60
00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:12.252
There's an overwhelming mountain
of evidence against her.

61
00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:14.462
This is open-and-shut.
Just go get it done.

62
00:04:14.545 --> 00:04:16.798
I want it done this week
so this media circus will go away.

63
00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:18.258
-Thank you.
-But. Rory. I...

64
00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:20.426
Go.

65
00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:23.012
Okay.

66
00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:27.267
Can you believe this?

67
00:04:27.892 --> 00:04:31.104
Ah! Congratulations. girl.
You know we all wanted it.

68
00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:33.940
I cannot believe he gave it to you.

69
00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:35.942
Donnie. shut the hell up.

70
00:04:36.025 --> 00:04:38.319
-I don't understand.
-But who asked you? It's not the time.

71
00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:39.988
This is nothing to celebrate. Tilsa.

72
00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:41.656
Look. it's a big case.

73
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.118
but you have a great relationship
with the DA. right?

74
00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:46.995
So maybe that's in her best interest.

75
00:04:48.037 --> 00:04:48.997
Great.

76
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.541
I have a great relationship with the DA.

77
00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:52.583
That's awesome.

78
00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:57.213
<i>Either way. it's really sad. Look around.</i>

79
00:04:57.297 --> 00:05:00.341
<i>And I don't see any way out of it.</i>
<i>If you ask me. it's getting worse.</i>

80
00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:02.635
<i>I can tell you.</i>
<i>without a doubt. the whole town's talking.</i>

81
00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.429
<i>This morning. while I was getting coffee.</i>

82
00:05:04.512 --> 00:05:07.390
<i>two or three conversations.</i>
<i>all about the Grace Waters case.</i>

83
00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:10.226
<i>Well. that's interesting.</i>
<i>How about our next caller?</i>

84
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.478
<i> I mean.</i>
<i>I feel like she's totally guilty.</i>

85
00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:15.273
<i>I don't even know</i>
<i>why we are wasting money with a trial.</i>

86
00:05:15.356 --> 00:05:17.734
<i>Just tie her up to an electric chair.</i>
<i>and hit the switch.</i>

87
00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:19.569
<i>Boom! Problem solved.</i>

88
00:05:31.205 --> 00:05:33.541
We're outside
the Holloway Correctional Facility.

89
00:05:33.624 --> 00:05:35.585
where Grace Waters is being held.

90
00:05:35.668 --> 00:05:37.628
She's scheduled for court in three days.

91
00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:41.382
As many of you know. she's been accused
of murdering her husband.

92
00:05:47.138 --> 00:05:49.640
Hi. I'm Jasmine Bryant
from the public defender's office.

93
00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:51.267
I'm here for Grace Waters.

94
00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:53.144
Yes. ma'am.
Step through here for me. please.

95
00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:58.399
And just put your bag on the table for me.

96
00:05:58.483 --> 00:05:59.317
Okay.

97
00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:05.156
-All right.
-Okay.

98
00:06:17.835 --> 00:06:21.297
Just have a seat.
and I will be right back with her.

99
00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:22.632
-E-Excuse me.

100
00:06:22.715 --> 00:06:25.009
- Yes?
-Um. is there anything I should know?

101
00:06:25.093 --> 00:06:26.469
Is this your first murderer?

102
00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:28.012
Yeah.

103
00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:30.640
You don't have anything to worry about.
She'll be shackled.

104
00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:24.861
Put your hands on the desk for me.

105
00:07:37.331 --> 00:07:40.543
I'm your attorney. Jasmine Bryant.

106
00:07:41.043 --> 00:07:44.547
I'm from the public defender's office.
I was appointed by the court.

107
00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:48.009
I told them I didn't want a lawyer.

108
00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:51.554
Well. if not me.
then some other lawyer will be here.

109
00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:53.764
The judge was very clear on that.

110
00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:57.226
So. I understand
that you want to plead guilty?

111
00:08:00.354 --> 00:08:01.606
How old are you?

112
00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:04.400
Twenty-six.

113
00:08:06.402 --> 00:08:08.571
What school did you go to?

114
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.198
Ruston.

115
00:08:10.698 --> 00:08:12.617
Community college.

116
00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:16.078
And then I went on to Baniview Law.

117
00:08:18.789 --> 00:08:20.291
Your file... um...

118
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.211
I had a chance to glance at it
on my way over here.

119
00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:26.506
and. um. I'm a little confused.
You worked at a bank.

120
00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:29.800
you've never even had a traffic violation.
and now you're here.

121
00:08:30.676 --> 00:08:34.055
I'm gonna ask the DA for 15 years
with the possibility of parole.

122
00:08:34.263 --> 00:08:36.265
I may be able to sell that to him.

123
00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:38.601
You're Catholic.

124
00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:41.812
-Yes.
- That wasn't a question.

125
00:08:42.271 --> 00:08:43.397
I see the rosary.

126
00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:48.444
Are you Catholic?

127
00:08:48.945 --> 00:08:50.363
<i>In the name of the Father.</i>

128
00:08:50.446 --> 00:08:51.447
and the Son.

129
00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:53.449
<i>and the Holy Spirit...</i>

130
00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:55.159
So. you pray the rosary?

131
00:08:57.078 --> 00:08:57.912
Yes.

132
00:09:01.123 --> 00:09:03.584
I want to move to a prison close to here.

133
00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:08.631
I want to be able to see my son
and my grandbaby...

134
00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:10.675
at some point.

135
00:09:12.134 --> 00:09:13.135
And I want that

136
00:09:13.803 --> 00:09:15.096
in the plea deal.

137
00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:19.517
Okay. I'll see what I can do.

138
00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:22.478
Guard!

139
00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.691
<i> Okay. So what was she like?</i>

140
00:09:26.774 --> 00:09:29.360
<i>Well.</i>
<i>it was nothing like I expected.</i>

141
00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:32.655
<i>She was like my mom. and yours.</i>
<i>She was...</i>

142
00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:34.073
gentle.

143
00:09:34.156 --> 00:09:35.700
- Hmm. Mm.
- Gentle.

144
00:09:35.783 --> 00:09:37.868
You know. but. at first glance...

145
00:09:40.037 --> 00:09:42.331
she appears to be
a picture-perfect defendant.

146
00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:44.041
She baked cookies for kids.

147
00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:47.336
she sang in a church choir.
she taught Sunday school.

148
00:09:48.045 --> 00:09:51.007
There's a lot of good things here
for you to build a solid defense.

149
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.675
The evidence against her is overwhelming.

150
00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:55.052
But beyond a reasonable doubt?
It was circumstantial.

151
00:09:56.554 --> 00:09:59.140
She confessed she did it.
She wants to plead guilty.

152
00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:01.642
- I mean...

153
00:10:01.726 --> 00:10:03.102
-This--
- Donnie. just chill.

154
00:10:03.185 --> 00:10:04.937
No. no. no. No. no.

155
00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:06.939
-What. Donnie?

156
00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:10.026
I-I-I'm not trying to take away
from your remarkable ability

157
00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:11.110
as a public defender.

158
00:10:11.193 --> 00:10:14.071
um. but they gave you this case
because they want you to plead it.

159
00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:15.031
be done with it.

160
00:10:15.114 --> 00:10:17.992
as to not embarrass
the public defender's office.

161
00:10:18.075 --> 00:10:20.995
But how embarrassing would it be.
due to the high profile of this case.

162
00:10:21.078 --> 00:10:22.413
if you were missing something?

163
00:10:22.496 --> 00:10:23.998
What could I be missing. Donnie?

164
00:10:24.081 --> 00:10:26.626
Okay. like she said. okay.
what could she be missing?

165
00:10:26.709 --> 00:10:28.002
The woman confessed. right?

166
00:10:28.085 --> 00:10:30.755
-Exactly.
- Please don't encourage her.

167
00:10:30.838 --> 00:10:32.381
Did she confess to you?

168
00:10:32.965 --> 00:10:35.426
-No. she told the officers that she--
-Ah. You see?

169
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:37.511
You see? This is what I'm talkin' about.

170
00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:40.306
You can't just plea her down
without knowing all of the facts.

171
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:42.350
I know the facts. okay?

172
00:10:42.433 --> 00:10:44.268
This is an open-and-shut. Donnie.

173
00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:46.395
With our workload.
we don't have enough time or money

174
00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:47.396
to even deal with this.

175
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.774
Hell. the drug dealers we represent
make more money than us.

176
00:10:49.857 --> 00:10:51.359
and they have no respect for us.

177
00:10:51.442 --> 00:10:53.277
Look. I'm not gonna go back and forth
with you.

178
00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:54.487
- Sorry.
-You always do this.

179
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.864
but what does that have to do
with the Sunday school teacher

180
00:10:56.947 --> 00:10:58.699
who bakes cookies
for kids in the neighborhood?

181
00:11:01.577 --> 00:11:03.913
Okay. so I think we should leave.

182
00:11:07.541 --> 00:11:10.086
You know. that is the most sensible thing
you've said all night.

183
00:11:10.169 --> 00:11:11.003
Thank you.

184
00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:13.089
You know.
I will never get used to seeing

185
00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:14.256
people going to jail.

186
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.884
Either this is your cause. or it ain't.

187
00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:18.594
Figure it out. Jas.

188
00:11:20.429 --> 00:11:21.389
-Jordan.
-Night. girl.

189
00:11:21.472 --> 00:11:22.890
- Hm.
- So we'll see you tomorrow.

190
00:11:22.973 --> 00:11:24.350
-Yeah.
- Okay. y'all have a nice night.

191
00:11:24.433 --> 00:11:26.894
-Thanks for having us. Beautiful home.
- You. too. Tilsa.

192
00:11:26.977 --> 00:11:28.688
I'mma talk to him. okay?

193
00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:30.773
-Don't worry about it.
- Just a little chat.

194
00:11:30.856 --> 00:11:34.860
Donnie. get your ass over here!
This is why they don't invite us no more.

195
00:11:34.944 --> 00:11:36.362
How you actin' right now...

196
00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:41.867
-See what I mean?
- Yeah.

197
00:11:43.494 --> 00:11:44.495
Can't win.

198
00:11:53.587 --> 00:11:55.798
I saw an old woman fall to her death.

199
00:11:57.842 --> 00:11:58.801
But I'm all right.

200
00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:03.973
Your turn.

201
00:12:10.438 --> 00:12:12.940
You know.
when I graduated from law school...

202
00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:17.069
I thought I had hit the lottery.

203
00:12:17.862 --> 00:12:18.696
Yeah.

204
00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:20.948
But now that I'm into it. I...

205
00:12:24.034 --> 00:12:24.994
These people

206
00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:26.787
are murderers

207
00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:28.706
and liars.

208
00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.333
And they're thieves. babe.

209
00:12:32.334 --> 00:12:33.711
And to defend them. I...

210
00:12:37.631 --> 00:12:40.217
I'm just having second thoughts
about all of this.

211
00:12:42.136 --> 00:12:43.012
Really.

212
00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:47.224
I just wanna stay there long enough

213
00:12:47.933 --> 00:12:50.060
so I can get these student loans paid off.

214
00:12:54.023 --> 00:12:55.816
I don't want to be a lawyer anymore.

215
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.109
No. come on.

216
00:12:57.193 --> 00:12:58.152
I don't.

217
00:13:01.739 --> 00:13:02.907
Oh. come on.

218
00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:04.074
I don't.

219
00:13:04.158 --> 00:13:06.702
- This is what you're meant to do.

220
00:13:07.411 --> 00:13:08.913
You know that. babe. Come on.

221
00:13:16.545 --> 00:13:19.548
Last night I may have had one too many.
My bad.

222
00:13:20.341 --> 00:13:21.509
Was that an apology?

223
00:13:21.592 --> 00:13:23.052
If that's what you call it.

224
00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:25.387
Well. I think you do a great job. Jasmine.

225
00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:27.431
Thanks. Tilsa.

226
00:13:28.724 --> 00:13:30.059
At about 7:30.

227
00:13:30.142 --> 00:13:32.895
When are you talking to. uh. the DA
about Grace Waters?

228
00:13:32.978 --> 00:13:34.730
-Uh. later this afternoon.
- Get it done.

229
00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:37.191
-get it done. get it done.
-I'm meeting him at court.

230
00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:39.819
Jasmine.

231
00:13:39.902 --> 00:13:41.904
There's a Malcolm Waters here to see you.

232
00:13:41.987 --> 00:13:42.863
Who's that?

233
00:13:43.739 --> 00:13:45.783
-I don't know.
-Is he in the appointment book?

234
00:13:45.866 --> 00:13:46.784
Okay. all right.

235
00:13:47.868 --> 00:13:48.702
Malcolm?

236
00:13:48.786 --> 00:13:50.204
Yes. are you Jasmine?

237
00:13:50.287 --> 00:13:51.288
Yes. hi.

238
00:13:51.372 --> 00:13:52.957
Grace Waters is my mother.

239
00:13:53.165 --> 00:13:54.542
-Oh.
-You're gonna help her. right?

240
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:55.835
Um...

241
00:13:55.918 --> 00:13:57.419
- Uh. please.
-Uh...

242
00:13:57.503 --> 00:14:00.798
I love my mother.
and I know she's innocent. I know she is.

243
00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:04.176
-She couldn't do that to anyone. No one.

244
00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.136
She wouldn't even kill spiders
when I was growing up.

245
00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.930
She'd make my dad take 'em outside
in a cup.

246
00:14:08.013 --> 00:14:09.181
You have to help her.

247
00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:11.600
She wants to plead guilty.

248
00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:14.562
No. no. no.
don't let her do that. please.

249
00:14:14.645 --> 00:14:16.814
If I could talk to her.
She won't see me.

250
00:14:16.897 --> 00:14:19.358
You have to help her
or get me in to see her.

251
00:14:19.441 --> 00:14:21.068
You can't let her plead guilty.

252
00:14:22.611 --> 00:14:24.989
I'm sorry. there's nothing I can do.

253
00:14:25.447 --> 00:14:26.657
She wants to plead.

254
00:14:30.244 --> 00:14:31.245
I'm sorry.

255
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:36.292
Absolutely not.

256
00:14:36.375 --> 00:14:39.003
-I want life without parole.
-Look. are you serious?

257
00:14:39.128 --> 00:14:41.547
She has no record. She's a model citizen.

258
00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:42.965
She has no priors.

259
00:14:43.048 --> 00:14:44.925
Come on. we want 15 years.

260
00:14:45.175 --> 00:14:46.135
No deal.

261
00:14:46.635 --> 00:14:48.846
She wants a plea. she gets the max.

262
00:14:51.515 --> 00:14:53.350
Well.
what about giving her Millstone Prison.

263
00:14:53.434 --> 00:14:56.103
-so she'll be closer to her son?
-That I'll consider.

264
00:14:58.564 --> 00:15:00.024
<i>They're offering the maximum.</i>

265
00:15:00.107 --> 00:15:02.651
life without the possibility of parole.

266
00:15:04.778 --> 00:15:08.240
-And that's the best they can do?
- He's adamant about it.

267
00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:11.911
If we went to trial.
he could ask for the death penalty.

268
00:15:16.123 --> 00:15:18.834
-I think you should take this deal.

269
00:15:21.462 --> 00:15:22.338
Okay.

270
00:15:25.966 --> 00:15:26.800
Okay?

271
00:15:31.805 --> 00:15:33.140
Okay. do it.

272
00:16:42.209 --> 00:16:43.252
<i>Yes?</i>

273
00:16:43.335 --> 00:16:44.712
<i> Hi. Miss Sarah?</i>

274
00:16:44.795 --> 00:16:45.629
<i> Yes?</i>

275
00:16:45.713 --> 00:16:47.172
<i>This is Jasmine Bryant.</i>

276
00:16:47.256 --> 00:16:48.757
<i>I'm representing Grace Waters.</i>

277
00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:51.885
<i>Is it possible that I could come by</i>
<i>this morning?</i>

278
00:16:51.969 --> 00:16:53.637
<i>Why. yes. I'm home.</i>

279
00:16:53.721 --> 00:16:56.974
<i>My address is 2342 West Lesson Lane.</i>

280
00:16:57.599 --> 00:16:59.435
- <i>Okay. Thank you.</i>
-<i> All right.</i>

281
00:17:00.185 --> 00:17:01.228
<i>See you then.</i>

282
00:17:02.354 --> 00:17:03.272
Hi.

283
00:17:04.148 --> 00:17:06.400
Hi. uh. would you mind. please?

284
00:17:06.483 --> 00:17:07.985
- Oh. sure.
-This thing is so heavy.

285
00:17:08.068 --> 00:17:09.737
- No problem.
-Oh. my goodness.

286
00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:11.405
I got three tenants.

287
00:17:11.822 --> 00:17:14.074
-Ooh. yeah.

288
00:17:14.199 --> 00:17:16.160
Just get it on this curb.
and we'll be fine.

289
00:17:16.243 --> 00:17:17.244
- Okay.

290
00:17:19.413 --> 00:17:21.498
-Thank you. Thank you so much.

291
00:17:21.582 --> 00:17:22.541
Okay.

292
00:17:23.917 --> 00:17:25.419
Oh. yeah. that's. uh--

293
00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:27.963
That's one of my tenants. there.

294
00:17:28.047 --> 00:17:29.548
They don't have family. It's sad.

295
00:17:29.631 --> 00:17:30.507
But come on in. honey.

296
00:17:30.591 --> 00:17:32.468
-Come in out of this rain.
- Okay.

297
00:17:32.551 --> 00:17:33.552
Do you like coffee?

298
00:17:33.635 --> 00:17:36.388
- Oh. I do. Thank you very much.
- All right.

299
00:17:39.349 --> 00:17:41.643
They said there would be sunshine today.

300
00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:44.521
So much for what they know.

301
00:17:44.605 --> 00:17:47.524
-I know. right? I know.

302
00:17:49.193 --> 00:17:50.402
- So...

303
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:53.238
...what brings you to see me?

304
00:17:53.697 --> 00:17:54.531
Um...

305
00:17:57.242 --> 00:17:58.494
Tears.

306
00:17:59.787 --> 00:18:00.704
Um...

307
00:18:01.205 --> 00:18:03.123
I saw Miss Grace cry tears

308
00:18:03.207 --> 00:18:06.376
that I've never seen
a guilty person cry yesterday.

309
00:18:07.294 --> 00:18:09.630
You know. I have to tell you.
I feel really bad.

310
00:18:11.048 --> 00:18:12.591
A lot of this is my fault.

311
00:18:14.426 --> 00:18:15.552
Why do you say that?

312
00:18:16.845 --> 00:18:19.515
Age is a bitch. darling.
It'll sneak up on you.

313
00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.811
One day you all lovely-lookin'.
just like you. all young and lovely.

314
00:18:24.186 --> 00:18:27.773
Seem like the next day you're my age.
wondering where all the time went.

315
00:18:27.856 --> 00:18:30.859
- I'm a little older than she is.

316
00:18:32.736 --> 00:18:35.697
But I didn't want her to be like me.

317
00:18:36.406 --> 00:18:37.282
Lonely...

318
00:18:38.117 --> 00:18:39.284
and livin' in a house

319
00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:42.121
with old ladies and their cats.

320
00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:46.375
She's such a good soul.

321
00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:49.711
So. I tried to encourage her to go out.

322
00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:51.296
you know. all the time. but...

323
00:18:52.131 --> 00:18:53.090
she wouldn't do it.

324
00:18:54.925 --> 00:18:55.759
Thank you.

325
00:18:55.843 --> 00:18:58.720
You're welcome.
And then. when her. uh. son got married...

326
00:19:00.139 --> 00:19:02.057
...that's when everything took a turn.

327
00:19:02.724 --> 00:19:07.396
I mean. I literally watched
as she changed before my very eyes.

328
00:19:07.479 --> 00:19:11.608
It was after the wedding. We were sitting
and talking over a glass of wine. and...

329
00:19:11.942 --> 00:19:15.445
Oh. she was so sad about
what she thought her life would be.

330
00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:17.656
and... and what it was.

331
00:19:17.739 --> 00:19:19.032
And it wasn't bad.

332
00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:22.161
No. 'cause she had a lovely home.
Beautiful home.

333
00:19:22.244 --> 00:19:24.163
-And a good job. too.
-Okay.

334
00:19:24.246 --> 00:19:25.789
But her ex-husband.

335
00:19:25.873 --> 00:19:28.000
he was living better than she was. and...

336
00:19:28.709 --> 00:19:33.714
seemed like his wife was living
Grace's dream. and--

337
00:19:35.048 --> 00:19:36.258
You gonna take notes?

338
00:19:37.301 --> 00:19:39.469
Oh. Yes. Uh. thank you.

339
00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:45.893
Yes.

340
00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:49.188
So. it was after the wedding.

341
00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:52.774
and we had come in.
We hadn't even taken off our dresses.

342
00:19:52.858 --> 00:19:56.320
when she started to just--
just come apart at the seams.

343
00:19:56.403 --> 00:19:59.489
I mean. that wedding took place
in her ex-husband's house.

344
00:19:59.573 --> 00:20:01.200
and that used to be Grace's house.

345
00:20:01.283 --> 00:20:02.910
-Hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

346
00:20:03.118 --> 00:20:05.954
I don't know. Grace. why'd they have
to have a wedding in the house?

347
00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:07.331
-Mm-hmm.
-And those tacky drapes.

348
00:20:07.414 --> 00:20:09.416
Wait. now. those were my drapes.

349
00:20:09.499 --> 00:20:11.251
Thank you.

350
00:20:11.335 --> 00:20:15.005
-He didn't even change the drapes?
-He didn't even change the drapes.

351
00:20:15.088 --> 00:20:17.507
We built a life in that house.

352
00:20:18.717 --> 00:20:20.052
And here I am. just...

353
00:20:20.594 --> 00:20:21.553
Angry.

354
00:20:21.637 --> 00:20:24.890
No. I'm not really angry.
I'm just hurt.

355
00:20:24.973 --> 00:20:27.267
And angry. Go on. say it.

356
00:20:27.726 --> 00:20:28.560
Okay.

357
00:20:29.186 --> 00:20:30.938
Okay. I am angry.

358
00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:32.356
Damn right.

359
00:20:32.439 --> 00:20:34.524
And you have every right. so be pissed.

360
00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:35.984
Hell.

361
00:20:36.193 --> 00:20:38.445
That little heifer's young enough
to be his daughter.

362
00:20:38.528 --> 00:20:39.363
Right?

363
00:20:41.198 --> 00:20:43.575
She is five years older than my son.

364
00:20:44.618 --> 00:20:45.786
Our son.

365
00:20:47.829 --> 00:20:48.997
Just so unfair.

366
00:20:49.623 --> 00:20:51.875
It's like he just went on with his life.

367
00:20:53.543 --> 00:20:56.713
Like I was some kind of speed bump
that just slowed him down.

368
00:20:59.091 --> 00:20:59.925
Just...

369
00:21:04.054 --> 00:21:05.264
How did I even get here?

370
00:21:07.391 --> 00:21:08.725
I want my life back.

371
00:21:11.395 --> 00:21:13.272
I want my youth back.

372
00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:15.691
I want to laugh.

373
00:21:17.317 --> 00:21:19.152
I wanna love somebody. I wanna...

374
00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:20.779
be loved.

375
00:21:21.697 --> 00:21:24.199
-I can't help you with your youth.

376
00:21:24.449 --> 00:21:26.451
but I can help you with the rest of it.

377
00:21:27.953 --> 00:21:30.789
You need to get the hell out this house
and meet somebody.

378
00:21:30.872 --> 00:21:32.124
Who?

379
00:21:32.791 --> 00:21:34.668
-I don't know.

380
00:21:34.751 --> 00:21:36.461
But I see these commercials on TV.

381
00:21:36.545 --> 00:21:41.049
You could go on ChristianDateOnline.com.

382
00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:42.050
What?

383
00:21:42.134 --> 00:21:44.136
- You could!
-No. I could not.

384
00:21:44.219 --> 00:21:46.847
No. Come on. now. Sarah.

385
00:21:47.639 --> 00:21:51.101
No. come on. If I wanted to meet someone.
I want to do it...

386
00:21:51.685 --> 00:21:53.478
I want to do it the old-fashioned way.

387
00:21:54.354 --> 00:21:57.024
Might be a little late in the evening
for the old-fashioned way.

388
00:21:57.107 --> 00:21:59.735
- <i>So how'd the two meet?</i>

389
00:22:00.444 --> 00:22:01.903
At an art gallery.

390
00:22:02.738 --> 00:22:03.572
Hold on.

391
00:22:05.782 --> 00:22:07.034
Let me see.

392
00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.380
Hi there. Oh...

393
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:25.635
This is a flyer
from when they repossessed her house.

394
00:22:27.346 --> 00:22:28.847
They put everything out on the street.

395
00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:31.266
and I gathered those things that I could.
at least the things

396
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:33.894
-I thought that would be of value to her.
- Mm-hmm.

397
00:22:34.311 --> 00:22:38.815
This is a flyer from his show
at that gallery where she met him.

398
00:22:38.899 --> 00:22:40.067
-Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

399
00:22:40.817 --> 00:22:42.903
That's his photograph.

400
00:22:43.487 --> 00:22:45.989
He gave her the original
the day after he met her.

401
00:22:46.573 --> 00:22:47.783
He was a photographer.

402
00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:49.618
You can keep that.

403
00:22:49.701 --> 00:22:50.535
Thank you.

404
00:22:50.619 --> 00:22:54.289
I'd love to talk to you some more.
but my ladies haven't had their breakfast.

405
00:22:55.582 --> 00:22:58.251
Would you mind if we talked again later?

406
00:22:58.335 --> 00:23:01.588
Oh. okay. Um. sure. Um...

407
00:23:03.423 --> 00:23:05.675
Thank you.
Thank you so much for having me.

408
00:23:05.759 --> 00:23:07.094
No. thank you for coming.

409
00:23:07.177 --> 00:23:08.512
Huh? It's...

410
00:23:08.678 --> 00:23:10.889
-Okay. Oh! Um...

411
00:23:11.139 --> 00:23:12.599
-That's nothing. come on.
-Okay.

412
00:23:12.682 --> 00:23:16.686
Uh. thank you for caring so much
about Grace and taking good care.

413
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:17.938
All right. thank you so much.

414
00:23:18.021 --> 00:23:19.731
- All right.
- Have a great day.

415
00:23:19.815 --> 00:23:21.942
- Thank you. Buh-bye.
- Okay. bye-bye.

416
00:23:30.409 --> 00:23:31.243
Hey. babe.

417
00:23:31.743 --> 00:23:32.953
Come here. look at this.

418
00:23:33.036 --> 00:23:34.621
Can I get a hello first?
Can I get some love?

419
00:23:34.704 --> 00:23:35.539
Hey.

420
00:23:36.081 --> 00:23:38.875
Okay. Now. look at this
and tell me what you see.

421
00:23:38.959 --> 00:23:42.003
-Uh... that's luminol.
-Yes.

422
00:23:42.087 --> 00:23:44.256
- It's a lot of blood. too.
- Mm-hmm.

423
00:23:44.923 --> 00:23:47.801
And it's dark in some places
and lighter in the others.

424
00:23:48.718 --> 00:23:49.928
Yeah. and?

425
00:23:50.011 --> 00:23:53.473
And if he lost this much blood. say.
from a blow to the head.

426
00:23:54.057 --> 00:23:56.143
why is it pooling from the outside in.

427
00:23:56.226 --> 00:23:58.895
as it looks like it did in the picture?
Hmm?

428
00:23:59.354 --> 00:24:02.190
Then I'd say that you're asking
the questions a good lawyer would.

429
00:24:10.323 --> 00:24:11.658
Rory. hi.

430
00:24:11.741 --> 00:24:14.953
-Some coffee in here. please. Yeah?
-Um. yeah. I wanted you to see this.

431
00:24:15.036 --> 00:24:17.205
You see how the blood is pooling
from the outside in?

432
00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:19.791
-Yeah.
-I wanna hire an expert in blood splatter

433
00:24:19.875 --> 00:24:20.876
and in luminol--

434
00:24:20.959 --> 00:24:22.752
Where have you been
for the past nine months?

435
00:24:22.836 --> 00:24:24.880
This office cannot afford
a blood pattern expert.

436
00:24:24.963 --> 00:24:26.715
What you talking about?
What's this about anyway?

437
00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:28.884
Grace Waters. her defense.

438
00:24:31.887 --> 00:24:33.388
That woman is pleading guilty.

439
00:24:33.472 --> 00:24:35.182
I don't know what you're talking about.

440
00:24:35.265 --> 00:24:38.018
Now. get down to the jail
and get the plea deal signed.

441
00:24:38.101 --> 00:24:39.561
It's already there. Get it signed.

442
00:24:39.644 --> 00:24:41.771
This circus needs to stop.
My phone's ringing off the hook.

443
00:24:41.855 --> 00:24:43.815
I've got the mayor and everybody
calling me about this.

444
00:24:43.899 --> 00:24:46.443
Rory. but I found some really great stuff.
and I think--

445
00:24:46.526 --> 00:24:47.360
Jasmine.

446
00:24:49.321 --> 00:24:50.989
If you argued like this in court.

447
00:24:51.072 --> 00:24:52.782
you could actually be a lawyer.

448
00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.034
Go.

449
00:25:00.582 --> 00:25:02.459
Coffee! Coffee! Coffee!

450
00:25:04.085 --> 00:25:05.504
- So sorry.
-Thank you.

451
00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:08.632
What the hell is this?

452
00:25:11.551 --> 00:25:14.513
This is the plea agreement from the DA.

453
00:25:15.305 --> 00:25:18.058
He did manage to say
that he will put you in a facility

454
00:25:18.141 --> 00:25:19.726
that's close to your son.

455
00:25:22.646 --> 00:25:23.730
You can sign here.

456
00:25:28.944 --> 00:25:30.487
You have a pen?

457
00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:33.073
Yeah. Sorry.

458
00:25:49.965 --> 00:25:51.424
Who've you been talkin' to?

459
00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:55.053
Your friend Sarah.

460
00:25:57.722 --> 00:25:59.808
Grace. please tell me what happened.

461
00:26:00.892 --> 00:26:02.227
What did he do to you?

462
00:26:04.437 --> 00:26:05.313
Please.

463
00:26:07.315 --> 00:26:08.149
Tell me.

464
00:26:15.574 --> 00:26:16.783
<i>Heels.</i>

465
00:26:21.079 --> 00:26:22.205
Heels.

466
00:26:28.253 --> 00:26:30.714
I don't know why
I remember the heels that day.

467
00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.967
It was a normal day. like any other.

468
00:26:38.346 --> 00:26:39.556
When you wake up...

469
00:26:42.475 --> 00:26:44.019
you don't know that...

470
00:26:46.521 --> 00:26:50.233
today will be the day
to change your life...

471
00:26:54.904 --> 00:26:55.739
End it.

472
00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.452
<i>Everything felt so normal.</i>

473
00:27:05.957 --> 00:27:07.000
Thank you.

474
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:22.432
<i>After work that day.</i>
<i>I went to a... a gallery opening.</i>

475
00:27:23.266 --> 00:27:24.559
<i>I was a little tired.</i>

476
00:27:24.643 --> 00:27:28.772
<i>but I wanted to see this exhibit</i>
<i>that Sarah had told me about.</i>

477
00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:32.442
<i>She was worried about me</i>
<i>being in the house too much. </i>

478
00:27:33.735 --> 00:27:35.945
<i>But she was adamant that I go. so...</i>

479
00:27:37.322 --> 00:27:38.156
<i>I did.</i>

480
00:27:39.115 --> 00:27:42.202
- Hi.
<i>-</i> Excuse me.<i> </i>I'm sorry.

481
00:27:43.286 --> 00:27:44.162
-Ah...
-I get it.

482
00:27:44.245 --> 00:27:48.375
you have to see these in the right light.
And the best lighting in the room is...

483
00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:50.627
right here. so...

484
00:27:52.003 --> 00:27:53.254
The owner's a family friend.

485
00:27:53.338 --> 00:27:55.799
and I don't have the heart to tell her
that the lighting sucks.

486
00:27:55.882 --> 00:27:59.844
Well. it's not really that bad
from right here.

487
00:28:00.428 --> 00:28:02.430
And what do you know
about shadows and light?

488
00:28:02.722 --> 00:28:03.640
Well...

489
00:28:04.099 --> 00:28:06.893
I don't know anything
as well as this photographer.

490
00:28:08.019 --> 00:28:10.188
She's... brilliant.

491
00:28:10.271 --> 00:28:12.315
What makes you so sure that she's a she?

492
00:28:13.692 --> 00:28:15.568
Hmm. The name.

493
00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:17.696
Shannon.

494
00:28:18.071 --> 00:28:19.614
And look at the shadows.

495
00:28:19.698 --> 00:28:22.701
the way she captures
the emotions of these tribes.

496
00:28:22.784 --> 00:28:25.704
Now. only a woman sees like that.
It's beautiful.

497
00:28:25.787 --> 00:28:27.872
You know what?
I think she's Ethiopian. too.

498
00:28:27.956 --> 00:28:31.710
because she has to know somebody to get in
and get to know these people.

499
00:28:31.793 --> 00:28:34.671
Some of these places are extremely remote.

500
00:28:34.754 --> 00:28:38.508
I think only a native
can navigate this closely.

501
00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:40.802
You seem to know a lot about Ethiopia.

502
00:28:40.885 --> 00:28:43.805
Just what I've read.

503
00:28:44.222 --> 00:28:45.515
I love Africa.

504
00:28:45.932 --> 00:28:46.933
African history.

505
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:48.560
- Mm.
-I wanna go one day.

506
00:28:49.144 --> 00:28:51.146
You should. It'll change your life.

507
00:28:52.021 --> 00:28:53.606
Oh. you've been?

508
00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:55.567
-I have.
- Lucky you.

509
00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:57.402
-Lucky me. to meet you.
-Mm-hmm.

510
00:29:00.238 --> 00:29:01.614
Ooh. wow. is that a...

511
00:29:01.698 --> 00:29:03.825
-Is that an Uzo<i> </i>necklace?
-Yeah. good eye.

512
00:29:04.367 --> 00:29:05.994
-Wow.
-Got this in Africa. One of a kind.

513
00:29:08.913 --> 00:29:09.831
Wow.

514
00:29:09.914 --> 00:29:10.749
Beautiful.

515
00:29:11.624 --> 00:29:12.625
We need you.

516
00:29:13.334 --> 00:29:15.211
Excuse me while I take
this handsome thing away.

517
00:29:15.754 --> 00:29:16.921
-Please.
-Absolutely.

518
00:29:17.005 --> 00:29:19.382
Okay.

519
00:29:23.803 --> 00:29:25.221
Ladies and gentlemen.

520
00:29:25.305 --> 00:29:27.182
thank you so much
for coming to this exhibit.

521
00:29:27.265 --> 00:29:31.728
We are so excited
to have this amazing artist here.

522
00:29:32.103 --> 00:29:34.272
We love his work here in Holloway.

523
00:29:34.355 --> 00:29:37.859
Introducing Shannon Delong.
ladies and gentlemen.

524
00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:43.698
Ladies and gentlemen. thank you so much
for coming out tonight.

525
00:29:43.782 --> 00:29:45.283
I really appreciate that.

526
00:29:45.742 --> 00:29:48.244
Um. for those of you that don't know me.

527
00:29:48.953 --> 00:29:50.121
I am an introvert.

528
00:29:50.747 --> 00:29:53.750
which means I have trouble
speaking in front of...

529
00:29:55.251 --> 00:29:57.253
-semi-large crowds.

530
00:29:57.337 --> 00:29:59.923
But I hope
you enjoy the exhibit. It's called "Guzo."

531
00:30:00.006 --> 00:30:02.258
It is from my travels in Ethiopia.

532
00:30:02.675 --> 00:30:03.635
And remember...

533
00:30:04.719 --> 00:30:07.222
a lot of the proceeds tonight
go to charity. so...

534
00:30:07.847 --> 00:30:09.516
please spend a large amount of money.

535
00:30:09.599 --> 00:30:12.060
- Hear. hear.
- Okay? Thank you.

536
00:30:12.143 --> 00:30:13.353
-Enjoy.

537
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:28.493
<i>The next day. I got to work.</i>

538
00:30:28.576 --> 00:30:31.746
<i>and I didn't even know</i>
<i>how he found out where I worked.</i>

539
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:33.081
<i>but there it was.</i>

540
00:30:33.164 --> 00:30:34.833
<i>He was flirting with me.</i>

541
00:30:35.416 --> 00:30:38.294
<i>Nobody had flirted with me in 25 years.</i>

542
00:30:38.378 --> 00:30:39.963
<i>and I had butterflies.</i>

543
00:30:40.338 --> 00:30:42.090
<i>Grown-ass woman with butterflies.</i>

544
00:30:43.091 --> 00:30:45.635
<i>It was beautifully tragic.</i>

545
00:30:46.177 --> 00:30:48.805
<i>Before I knew it. I was smiling and giddy.</i>

546
00:30:49.222 --> 00:30:50.765
<i>I felt like a schoolgirl.</i>

547
00:30:51.349 --> 00:30:54.561
<i>I wondered. "Why? Who was this man?</i>

548
00:30:55.061 --> 00:30:56.604
<i>Why was he flirting with me?"</i>

549
00:30:56.855 --> 00:30:59.983
<i>That voice in my head was screaming.</i>
<i>"What does he want? What does he want?"</i>

550
00:31:00.733 --> 00:31:02.777
<i>But I was intrigued.</i>

551
00:31:03.319 --> 00:31:06.489
<i>So I called Sarah</i>
<i>to see if I should go out with him.</i>

552
00:31:07.448 --> 00:31:10.159
<i>You will not believe</i>
<i>what your photographer did.</i>

553
00:31:10.243 --> 00:31:11.661
Do you need me to drive you?

554
00:31:11.744 --> 00:31:15.123
<i>-'Cause you </i>are <i>going. Call him.</i>
- What?

555
00:31:15.748 --> 00:31:16.708
Call him.

556
00:31:17.375 --> 00:31:20.295
Okay. okay. I will.

557
00:31:20.378 --> 00:31:22.964
You are crazy and pushy.

558
00:31:24.215 --> 00:31:26.676
<i>I did wait a day to call him.</i>

559
00:31:26.968 --> 00:31:28.303
<i>I couldn't seem desperate.</i>

560
00:31:28.386 --> 00:31:29.304
Call you?

561
00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:32.724
Yeah. I don't think so. buddy.

562
00:31:34.684 --> 00:31:36.895
<i>But curiosity got the best of me.</i>

563
00:31:36.978 --> 00:31:39.063
<i>When I got to work the next day. I said.</i>

564
00:31:39.522 --> 00:31:40.648
<i>"What the hell?"</i>

565
00:31:42.942 --> 00:31:46.195
- <i>Hi.</i>
-Hi. Um. uh...

566
00:31:46.279 --> 00:31:47.405
<i>How are you?</i>

567
00:31:49.365 --> 00:31:52.368
Oh. don't act like you know who this is.

568
00:31:52.452 --> 00:31:53.786
<i>It's Grace. right?</i>

569
00:31:54.287 --> 00:31:56.915
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>You got my photo?</i>

570
00:31:57.373 --> 00:31:59.751
- <i>Yes. I did. Thank you.</i>
<i>-</i> <i>No.</i>

571
00:31:59.959 --> 00:32:01.920
<i>I'm not accepting your thank-you</i>
<i>over the phone.</i>

572
00:32:02.003 --> 00:32:03.838
<i>Oh. </i> <i>O-Okay.</i>

573
00:32:04.255 --> 00:32:06.799
- <i>Only over dinner.</i>
<i>-</i><i> Mm. Okay.</i>

574
00:32:06.883 --> 00:32:10.053
<i>I know this perfect. little.</i>
<i>quaint. hole-in-the-wall diner.</i>

575
00:32:10.136 --> 00:32:11.930
<i>Well. I-I'm fine with that.</i>

576
00:32:15.141 --> 00:32:15.975
Thank you.

577
00:32:17.352 --> 00:32:18.811
So. tell me something.

578
00:32:18.895 --> 00:32:20.521
how did you find me?

579
00:32:20.939 --> 00:32:22.148
You signed my guestbook.

580
00:32:22.732 --> 00:32:25.151
Tell me something.
Why'd it take you so long to call me?

581
00:32:28.154 --> 00:32:30.740
I mean. there I was.
I met this beautiful woman

582
00:32:31.157 --> 00:32:32.659
that I wanted to know a lot more about.

583
00:32:32.742 --> 00:32:35.161
and she just kinda left me standing there.
so...

584
00:32:36.079 --> 00:32:40.041
I know you've had many young.
beautiful women.

585
00:32:40.124 --> 00:32:41.000
I mean. um...

586
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:44.003
I was just wondering.

587
00:32:44.545 --> 00:32:46.089
-Why me?

588
00:32:46.923 --> 00:32:48.758
First of all. yes.

589
00:32:49.842 --> 00:32:51.469
I have had more than my share.

590
00:32:52.053 --> 00:32:55.515
But as you get older. that kind of thing
no longer interests you.

591
00:32:55.598 --> 00:32:57.684
and you said
something kind of interesting to me.

592
00:32:57.767 --> 00:33:00.144
You said. "Why me?"

593
00:33:00.937 --> 00:33:02.939
As people. we--
we tend to do that to ourselves.

594
00:33:03.022 --> 00:33:05.316
It's always like.
"Why me? Why me? Why me?"

595
00:33:05.608 --> 00:33:07.944
Shouldn't the question be.
"Why <i>not </i>you?"

596
00:33:10.488 --> 00:33:11.906
Divorce will do that to you.

597
00:33:13.116 --> 00:33:13.950
Make you...

598
00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:16.035
question who you are.

599
00:33:18.246 --> 00:33:19.497
So. why get divorced?

600
00:33:20.623 --> 00:33:21.708
People grow apart.

601
00:33:23.543 --> 00:33:24.669
Why aren't you married?

602
00:33:24.752 --> 00:33:27.255
-That question. yeah.
- Mmm.

603
00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:30.758
Now. I-I guess
it's just 'cause I grew up everywhere.

604
00:33:31.342 --> 00:33:34.178
and I was always kind of a gypsy.
Military kid.

605
00:33:34.721 --> 00:33:37.974
Uh. name it. New York. Boston.

606
00:33:38.641 --> 00:33:40.309
Atlanta. DC. Seattle.

607
00:33:40.393 --> 00:33:43.479
Korea. Madrid. Japan. West Africa.
in that order.

608
00:33:43.563 --> 00:33:45.148
-Wow.

609
00:33:45.231 --> 00:33:47.608
Name a culture. I saw it.
I experienced it.

610
00:33:47.692 --> 00:33:49.736
But that was also hard to. you know.

611
00:33:49.819 --> 00:33:51.529
put down roots as a young man.

612
00:33:52.613 --> 00:33:53.990
I never wanted to be married.

613
00:33:56.242 --> 00:33:58.703
If I'm honest.
I really didn't want the responsibility.

614
00:33:58.786 --> 00:34:02.373
and a lot of women are into that.
You'd be surprised. you know.

615
00:34:02.457 --> 00:34:04.000
Yeah. I know.

616
00:34:04.083 --> 00:34:06.377
-Yeah.
-But that had to be hard as a kid.

617
00:34:06.461 --> 00:34:08.212
I mean. living everywhere.

618
00:34:08.296 --> 00:34:09.964
It was. But it was fun as a man.

619
00:34:10.923 --> 00:34:12.759
- No. not... I don't...

620
00:34:12.842 --> 00:34:15.219
'Cause not everything's about that.
Your mind's in the gutter.

621
00:34:15.303 --> 00:34:16.262
Okay? Yeah.

622
00:34:17.513 --> 00:34:19.223
I mean. seeing the world...

623
00:34:19.307 --> 00:34:20.183
Mm-hmm?

624
00:34:20.266 --> 00:34:22.977
...through the eyes of a 35-millimeter.
there's...

625
00:34:23.853 --> 00:34:24.729
nothing like that.

626
00:34:24.812 --> 00:34:27.732
-That sounds like fun.
- It was. Met a lot of people.

627
00:34:28.399 --> 00:34:29.984
-But I never met a stranger.
- Mm.

628
00:34:30.443 --> 00:34:31.944
I mean. take us. for example.

629
00:34:33.488 --> 00:34:35.990
-What?
-Well. don't you feel comfortable with me?

630
00:34:36.074 --> 00:34:37.825
- Honestly?

631
00:34:38.618 --> 00:34:40.203
Well. honestly. I just met you.

632
00:34:41.954 --> 00:34:43.748
And if we're being honest.
let's keep being honest.

633
00:34:43.831 --> 00:34:46.084
You keep doing this one thing.
You keep doing this one--

634
00:34:46.167 --> 00:34:48.795
-You have a pattern. You judge.
-Ooh. Oh.

635
00:34:48.878 --> 00:34:51.005
You can't say you don't.
because I'm watching you do it.

636
00:34:51.089 --> 00:34:51.964
- Okay.
-You judge.

637
00:34:52.048 --> 00:34:53.174
You know. it's just...

638
00:34:54.342 --> 00:34:55.468
It's kinda hard...

639
00:34:56.803 --> 00:35:00.473
you know.
when you walk in the room. and you...

640
00:35:01.516 --> 00:35:04.602
find your husband having sex
with his secretary.

641
00:35:04.685 --> 00:35:06.145
who is now his wife.

642
00:35:12.443 --> 00:35:13.861
I'm sorry to hear that.

643
00:35:14.654 --> 00:35:15.613
Thank you.

644
00:35:18.324 --> 00:35:19.200
Wine?

645
00:35:20.493 --> 00:35:22.745
Yes.

646
00:35:22.829 --> 00:35:26.040
<i> I </i>did <i>start to trust him</i>
<i>very quickly.</i>

647
00:35:26.666 --> 00:35:28.042
<i>I don't even know why.</i>

648
00:35:28.334 --> 00:35:32.171
<i>He was so kind.</i>
<i>and... and he knew what to say.</i>

649
00:35:32.839 --> 00:35:33.881
<i>He was gentle.</i>

650
00:35:34.549 --> 00:35:39.095
<i>I didn't even know that a man could be</i>
<i>that perfect. feel that perfect.</i>

651
00:35:39.428 --> 00:35:41.681
<i>I didn't want our first date to end.</i>

652
00:35:42.348 --> 00:35:43.558
<i>And neither did he.</i>

653
00:35:47.937 --> 00:35:48.896
Thank you. Kaitlyn.

654
00:35:51.816 --> 00:35:53.151
-Whoo!

655
00:35:53.234 --> 00:35:56.404
So your ex. he. uh...
he owns a mortgage company?

656
00:35:56.487 --> 00:35:59.073
Oh...
Why are you still on that?

657
00:35:59.323 --> 00:36:00.658
Okay.

658
00:36:01.033 --> 00:36:04.162
Hint. if a...
if a man is asking about your ex.

659
00:36:04.245 --> 00:36:05.997
it's because he's trying to see
how he measures up.

660
00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:06.998
Oh.

661
00:36:07.248 --> 00:36:09.083
And from what I can ascertain.

662
00:36:10.042 --> 00:36:11.878
unlike me. he's rich. and so are you.

663
00:36:14.213 --> 00:36:17.258
Well. <i>he</i> owns a mortgage company.

664
00:36:17.341 --> 00:36:20.303
- Mm.
-Not me. And I'm not rich.

665
00:36:21.387 --> 00:36:24.557
-I left the marriage and everything in it.
- Hmm?

666
00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:28.144
-You didn't fight for the money?
-Not a thing. no. I didn't want anything.

667
00:36:28.686 --> 00:36:32.398
I just wanted out.
I was... tired of the lies.

668
00:36:32.481 --> 00:36:33.858
-I get that.
- Mmm.

669
00:36:33.941 --> 00:36:34.942
I don't know why that is.

670
00:36:35.026 --> 00:36:37.069
why men have so much trouble
just being honest.

671
00:36:37.153 --> 00:36:38.738
And so you always tell the truth?

672
00:36:38.821 --> 00:36:41.657
Absolutely. 100%.
It-- It gets me in trouble sometimes.

673
00:36:41.741 --> 00:36:44.577
because I have this thing where
I just always say what's on my mind.

674
00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:46.996
Oh...

675
00:36:47.496 --> 00:36:48.372
Okay.

676
00:36:48.456 --> 00:36:51.876
Oh. my God. It is 2:00 a.m.

677
00:36:51.959 --> 00:36:52.793
Wow.

678
00:36:52.877 --> 00:36:56.172
I have to be at work at. uh. 7:00.

679
00:36:56.714 --> 00:36:57.590
Quit.

680
00:37:00.927 --> 00:37:02.178
Am I gonna see you again?

681
00:37:02.553 --> 00:37:04.430
Do you wanna see me again?

682
00:37:05.514 --> 00:37:07.016
I don't want you to leave now.

683
00:37:08.434 --> 00:37:09.310
Good night.

684
00:37:12.355 --> 00:37:14.565
<i>I didn't even realize</i>
<i>how long it had been</i>

685
00:37:14.649 --> 00:37:16.484
<i>since I had been touched.</i>

686
00:37:16.567 --> 00:37:19.111
<i>since I had a man reach for my hand.</i>

687
00:37:20.154 --> 00:37:24.909
<i>I felt something in me</i>
<i>that I hadn't felt in years.</i>

688
00:37:25.576 --> 00:37:29.288
<i>I tried to identify the feeling.</i>
<i>the emotions.</i>

689
00:37:29.372 --> 00:37:31.540
<i>but I couldn't bring it into focus</i>

690
00:37:31.624 --> 00:37:36.087
<i>because it was warmed over in fear.</i>

691
00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:38.464
<i>I was so terrified.</i>

692
00:37:38.547 --> 00:37:40.549
<i>The alarms going off in my head.</i>

693
00:37:40.633 --> 00:37:43.135
<i>telling myself</i>
<i>that I was too old for this shit.</i>

694
00:37:43.511 --> 00:37:46.305
<i>In my head.</i>
<i>I'm hearing that he's leading me on.</i>

695
00:37:46.514 --> 00:37:47.807
<i>that he wanted something.</i>

696
00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:52.061
<i>So I kept repeating to myself</i>
<i>what he said.</i>

697
00:37:52.144 --> 00:37:53.396
<i>"Why not you?" </i>

698
00:37:53.479 --> 00:37:55.523
<i>Why not me?</i>

699
00:37:56.148 --> 00:37:58.359
<i>Maybe God had answered</i>
<i>a seven-year-old prayer</i>

700
00:37:58.442 --> 00:38:00.569
<i>that I had prayed since my divorce.</i>

701
00:38:00.653 --> 00:38:02.655
<i>Maybe this </i>was <i>him.</i>

702
00:38:02.738 --> 00:38:05.741
<i>Somehow. he knew me</i>
<i>almost better than I did myself.</i>

703
00:38:06.284 --> 00:38:09.787
<i>Ooh. he was in my head</i>
<i>and well on his way to my heart.</i>

704
00:38:10.246 --> 00:38:14.166
<i>and I hadn't even known this man</i>
<i>for two days.</i>

705
00:38:15.793 --> 00:38:17.044
I know I'm a fool.

706
00:38:17.878 --> 00:38:20.715
-You're not a fool.
-Then what would you call it?

707
00:38:21.882 --> 00:38:22.717
Human.

708
00:38:24.135 --> 00:38:25.720
I don't wanna talk about this no more.

709
00:38:25.803 --> 00:38:28.723
No. Grace.<i> </i>please.

710
00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:30.433
Go on.

711
00:38:31.767 --> 00:38:32.643
So. tell me.

712
00:38:32.727 --> 00:38:34.395
<i>He was a perfect gentleman.</i>

713
00:38:34.478 --> 00:38:36.439
-What do you dream about?
-Mm-mm.

714
00:38:37.023 --> 00:38:39.567
-Dreams come with heartaches. so no.

715
00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:40.526
No. no. no. no.

716
00:38:40.609 --> 00:38:43.446
I know. somewhere in that big heart
of yours. you still dream.

717
00:38:43.529 --> 00:38:44.447
Come on.

718
00:38:44.613 --> 00:38:48.075
Well. my dream <i>was</i> to be a great mother.

719
00:38:48.743 --> 00:38:51.537
And I managed to do that.

720
00:38:52.371 --> 00:38:54.290
Ah. I got a great kid.

721
00:38:55.833 --> 00:38:59.086
Got about two more years
in graduate school.

722
00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:01.422
-Hmm?
-One of the proudest moments of my life.

723
00:39:01.505 --> 00:39:03.299
-Okay.

724
00:39:03.382 --> 00:39:05.384
You beam about him when you talk.

725
00:39:05.468 --> 00:39:07.970
-Oh. that's my heart.
-Ah.

726
00:39:08.054 --> 00:39:09.972
I just don't like
the tramp he's married to.

727
00:39:10.056 --> 00:39:12.433
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.
t-tell me how you really feel.

728
00:39:12.516 --> 00:39:15.978
I know. I'm sorry. God.
I don't call women names.

729
00:39:16.062 --> 00:39:18.481
-You just did.
<i>-</i>

730
00:39:18.564 --> 00:39:19.482
Yeah.

731
00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:20.858
It's just. he...

732
00:39:22.318 --> 00:39:24.153
-He deserves better.
- Hm.

733
00:39:25.112 --> 00:39:27.239
But I gotta let him be an adult.
you know?

734
00:39:27.323 --> 00:39:28.240
That you do.

735
00:39:28.324 --> 00:39:30.743
Boys will be boys. You have to let them
make their mistakes.

736
00:39:30.826 --> 00:39:32.995
Spoken like someone who's made a few.

737
00:39:33.079 --> 00:39:34.747
-More than a few. A lot.
- Mm.

738
00:39:36.916 --> 00:39:40.544
But. like your son.
I adored my mother.

739
00:39:40.628 --> 00:39:43.506
How do you know he adores me?

740
00:39:44.507 --> 00:39:45.383
How could he not?

741
00:39:47.426 --> 00:39:51.263
Well. we don't talk as much...
since she came around.

742
00:39:51.806 --> 00:39:52.932
That's a shame.

743
00:39:53.933 --> 00:39:58.020
I used to talk to my mother...
every day. three times a day sometimes.

744
00:39:58.104 --> 00:40:00.481
-Oh. wow. that's beautiful.
- Yeah.

745
00:40:01.732 --> 00:40:06.445
You know. I've been walking you home
several nights in a row now.

746
00:40:06.529 --> 00:40:08.864
-Yeah.
-Yeah. it's been-- it's been nice.

747
00:40:08.948 --> 00:40:11.117
But I've never seen
the inside of the house.

748
00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.576
I'm just kind of wondering why that is.

749
00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:16.372
Is it because you got a man in there?
Did your ex-husband buy the house?

750
00:40:16.497 --> 00:40:18.082
Is he hiding in the bushes
with an OJ knife?

751
00:40:18.165 --> 00:40:20.167
- Oh. wait.
-Does he own a white Bronco?

752
00:40:20.251 --> 00:40:21.669
-Stop.
-What's happening?

753
00:40:21.752 --> 00:40:24.713
Just stop.
Now. you know I don't have nobody.

754
00:40:24.797 --> 00:40:27.883
and ain't nobody in that house.
And I bought my own house. thank you.

755
00:40:28.676 --> 00:40:30.177
-Excuse me.

756
00:40:30.803 --> 00:40:32.972
You know this house was built
in the 1800s?

757
00:40:33.055 --> 00:40:35.766
And I refurbished it all by myself.
thank you.

758
00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:36.684
Wow.

759
00:40:36.767 --> 00:40:38.894
A lot of blood. sweat. and tears in there.

760
00:40:38.978 --> 00:40:40.062
But I love it.

761
00:40:41.522 --> 00:40:43.858
Very first house I ever bought.

762
00:40:45.192 --> 00:40:46.026
It's beautiful.

763
00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:47.111
Thank you.

764
00:40:47.987 --> 00:40:49.864
I would love to see the inside.

765
00:40:52.533 --> 00:40:54.743
You've been a perfect gentleman. Shannon.

766
00:40:56.954 --> 00:40:58.205
Mmm. but...

767
00:40:58.914 --> 00:40:59.957
That's still a no?

768
00:41:01.292 --> 00:41:02.168
For now.

769
00:41:04.628 --> 00:41:05.463
Okay.

770
00:41:07.423 --> 00:41:08.299
Tomorrow. then.

771
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:10.885
-Okay.
-Same time?

772
00:41:10.968 --> 00:41:11.802
Mm-hmm.

773
00:41:11.886 --> 00:41:13.846
-Different place?
- Mm-hmm.

774
00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:15.014
French. maybe?

775
00:41:16.056 --> 00:41:17.725
-Okay.
-You like French?

776
00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:20.019
<i>-Oui. oui.</i>
-Ooh.

777
00:41:20.102 --> 00:41:21.103
<i>Enchanté.</i>

778
00:41:25.441 --> 00:41:26.442
Good night.

779
00:41:26.525 --> 00:41:27.401
<i>Au revoir.</i>

780
00:41:33.699 --> 00:41:36.911
<i>Now. when I was in my 20s.</i>
<i>I could do that. out every night.</i>

781
00:41:36.994 --> 00:41:38.996
<i>but not so at this time in my life.</i>

782
00:41:39.079 --> 00:41:40.706
<i>I was so damn tired at work.</i>

783
00:41:41.415 --> 00:41:46.128
<i>but it didn't matter. I felt alive again.</i>
<i>I felt free.</i>

784
00:41:47.254 --> 00:41:49.590
<i>I mean.</i>
<i>I was burning the midnight oil</i>

785
00:41:49.673 --> 00:41:51.759
<i>and the candle at both ends.</i>

786
00:41:51.842 --> 00:41:53.969
<i>I was falling asleep at my desk.</i>

787
00:41:54.053 --> 00:41:56.639
<i>some days. in meetings with my boss.</i>

788
00:41:56.722 --> 00:41:58.098
<i>I was so out of my head.</i>

789
00:41:59.183 --> 00:42:00.226
<i>but I didn't care.</i>

790
00:42:00.643 --> 00:42:03.354
<i>All those years at that bank.</i>
<i>and I didn't even care.</i>

791
00:42:04.647 --> 00:42:07.816
<i>I was loving every moment</i>
<i>of being thought about</i>

792
00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:10.402
<i>and called and texted.</i>

793
00:42:10.861 --> 00:42:13.948
<i>I was just in heaven.</i>

794
00:42:16.784 --> 00:42:20.246
- <i>♪ Oh! ♪</i>
- <i>♪ Ride on Jesus ♪</i>

795
00:42:20.329 --> 00:42:22.540
<i>Three months came and went</i>
<i>like three days.</i>

796
00:42:22.623 --> 00:42:24.750
<i>and... and I had held him off.</i>

797
00:42:25.125 --> 00:42:29.004
<i>but I knew the time was comin'.</i>
<i>and. oh. he was trying.</i>

798
00:42:29.338 --> 00:42:32.841
<i>I mean. the man was going to church</i>
<i>with me.</i>

799
00:42:32.925 --> 00:42:34.635
<i>and he wasn't even the type at all.</i>

800
00:42:34.718 --> 00:42:38.347
<i>He was not into the church scene.</i>

801
00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:43.018
<i>Despite him not being into the church.</i>
<i>it was still magical.</i>

802
00:42:43.644 --> 00:42:45.354
<i>We had so much in common.</i>

803
00:42:45.437 --> 00:42:47.856
<i>I could start a sentence.</i>
<i>and he would finish it.</i>

804
00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:49.191
<i>It was just unreal.</i>

805
00:42:49.275 --> 00:42:51.735
- <i>He was really my soulmate.</i>

806
00:42:51.819 --> 00:42:55.239
<i>I had found what I was looking for.</i>
<i>and it felt so good.</i>

807
00:42:57.199 --> 00:43:01.036
<i>It was becoming harder and harder</i>
<i>to hold out and keep him at bay.</i>

808
00:43:01.996 --> 00:43:04.999
- <i>I was falling. and falling hard.</i>

809
00:43:05.708 --> 00:43:07.793
<i>We'd talk on the phone</i>
<i>until the sun came up.</i>

810
00:43:08.377 --> 00:43:10.754
<i>We even fell asleep on the phone</i>
<i>a few times.</i>

811
00:43:10.838 --> 00:43:13.632
<i>I didn't even recognize this new person</i>
<i>that I had become.</i>

812
00:43:14.341 --> 00:43:17.886
<i>and when I would tell myself to slow down.</i>
<i>slow down.</i>

813
00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:19.680
<i>-Sarah was right there.</i>

814
00:43:19.763 --> 00:43:22.558
-It's your fault.
-No. no. no. no. no.

815
00:43:22.725 --> 00:43:24.685
Oh. I have never seen you this happy.

816
00:43:24.768 --> 00:43:26.395
-Mm!

817
00:43:26.478 --> 00:43:28.731
-Oh. girl. I am. I am.
-Uh-huh. Ooh...

818
00:43:29.732 --> 00:43:33.360
<i>And I was. </i>
<i>I was so happy.</i>

819
00:43:34.153 --> 00:43:35.779
- I'm scared.
- Do you trust me?

820
00:43:35.863 --> 00:43:38.699
<i> I was just about willing</i>
<i>to do anything for him.</i>

821
00:43:38.782 --> 00:43:41.869
<i>-</i>Do you trust me?
- Yes.<i> </i>

822
00:43:42.286 --> 00:43:44.872
-Yeah. What is this. baby? What is it?
-Turn around.

823
00:43:44.955 --> 00:43:46.373
Ooh. wait. wait. no no. no.

824
00:43:46.457 --> 00:43:50.544
No. I feel. like. high grass or something.
I don't wanna be bit by no snake. Shannon.

825
00:43:50.628 --> 00:43:52.004
Okay. okay. okay. listen.

826
00:43:52.087 --> 00:43:53.255
-We talked about this.
-Yes.

827
00:43:53.964 --> 00:43:55.549
-Yeah.
-You're judging too much.

828
00:43:55.633 --> 00:43:58.010
-Okay. okay. okay.
-Just feel. okay? Just feel.

829
00:43:58.302 --> 00:43:59.386
All right. okay.

830
00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:01.180
What is this. baby? What is this?

831
00:44:01.263 --> 00:44:03.140
-My eyes closed...
-Spin around. spin around.

832
00:44:03.223 --> 00:44:04.308
-My eyes closed?
-Yes.

833
00:44:04.391 --> 00:44:07.144
-Eyes closed. spin around.
-Okay. okay. okay.

834
00:44:07.227 --> 00:44:11.023
-Okay. open. open.

835
00:44:13.067 --> 00:44:15.611
Oh. Shannon. that's beautiful.

836
00:44:16.904 --> 00:44:19.281
Oh. baby. those are beautiful.

837
00:44:20.449 --> 00:44:22.951
Oh. my God.

838
00:44:23.035 --> 00:44:24.912
Look at 'em. look at 'em!

839
00:44:24.995 --> 00:44:28.165
Ooh!

840
00:44:28.248 --> 00:44:31.293
I need a jar. And you can catch 'em
and put 'em inside...

841
00:44:31.627 --> 00:44:32.670
What are you doin'?

842
00:44:32.753 --> 00:44:34.963
-Grace Waters...
- What are you doin'?

843
00:44:35.214 --> 00:44:36.298
...will you marry me?

844
00:44:38.425 --> 00:44:39.635
-Yes.
- Is that a yes?

845
00:44:39.718 --> 00:44:41.720
-So. come on. give it to me.

846
00:44:46.517 --> 00:44:48.811
<i>I said yes before I knew it.</i>

847
00:44:52.147 --> 00:44:54.483
<i>I couldn't resist him for some reason.</i>

848
00:44:55.234 --> 00:44:56.902
<i>He was electric...</i>

849
00:44:59.363 --> 00:45:03.075
<i>...and so good at making me feel good.</i>

850
00:45:03.659 --> 00:45:04.743
<i>It was incredible.</i>

851
00:45:04.827 --> 00:45:05.911
Why are you takin' pictures?

852
00:45:05.994 --> 00:45:09.873
-Move this way...
- <i>Most of my entire life lived.</i>

853
00:45:09.957 --> 00:45:11.250
<i>and here I was.</i>

854
00:45:12.334 --> 00:45:15.379
- Victoria's Secret.

855
00:45:17.047 --> 00:45:19.967
<i>I thought love was over for me.</i>
<i>I really did.</i>

856
00:45:20.426 --> 00:45:22.886
<i>Those were the happiest days of my life.</i>

857
00:45:24.179 --> 00:45:25.013
<i>Until...</i>

858
00:45:26.181 --> 00:45:28.100
Please. tell me what else happened.

859
00:45:32.646 --> 00:45:34.189
You know Danielle Mitchell.

860
00:45:36.233 --> 00:45:37.443
She died here.

861
00:45:39.862 --> 00:45:41.196
She was your client.

862
00:45:43.949 --> 00:45:46.493
Now. I know a little something about you.
Jasmine.

863
00:45:47.745 --> 00:45:49.329
You've never tried a case.

864
00:45:50.998 --> 00:45:53.459
And word around here.
when they saw you come in...

865
00:45:55.002 --> 00:45:57.504
was that they had sent me
the worst of the worst

866
00:45:58.088 --> 00:46:00.007
of the public defender's office.

867
00:46:03.719 --> 00:46:05.304
You don't win.

868
00:46:06.263 --> 00:46:07.389
You plead.

869
00:46:08.891 --> 00:46:10.476
That's what you do.

870
00:46:11.101 --> 00:46:13.312
which was. uh. fine with me.

871
00:46:15.856 --> 00:46:17.608
Now give me the damn pen.

872
00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:29.620
- <i>What. she said all that?</i>
<i>-</i> <i>Yeah. but she's right.</i>

873
00:46:29.703 --> 00:46:33.248
I mean. what am I doing?
I have the signed plea agreement.

874
00:46:33.332 --> 00:46:35.918
I'm just gonna take it
to the DA's office. you know?

875
00:46:36.668 --> 00:46:40.214
I just want to be done with all this.

876
00:46:41.048 --> 00:46:42.841
I just want to move to Brookhaven.

877
00:46:42.925 --> 00:46:46.595
have a bunch of babies.
and have you support the family.

878
00:46:46.678 --> 00:46:47.513
-Yeah. okay.
-Come on.

879
00:46:47.596 --> 00:46:49.556
No. that'll last maybe two weeks.

880
00:46:50.265 --> 00:46:52.643
-One. One.
-Yeah. probably. Probably one.

881
00:46:55.854 --> 00:46:58.482
I just know there's so much more
to this story. baby.

882
00:46:59.233 --> 00:47:00.692
I just know there is.

883
00:47:02.319 --> 00:47:04.446
-There is.
-Okay. Well...

884
00:47:04.947 --> 00:47:07.950
she told you that much. just get her
to tell you the rest of the story.

885
00:47:09.451 --> 00:47:11.537
No. I'm done.

886
00:47:13.205 --> 00:47:14.039
I'm done.

887
00:47:18.168 --> 00:47:19.002
No. you're not.

888
00:47:20.003 --> 00:47:21.421
<i>Is the plea deal done?</i>

889
00:47:21.922 --> 00:47:23.215
At this point...

890
00:47:24.842 --> 00:47:27.594
if you wanna be in here
for the rest of your life.

891
00:47:27.678 --> 00:47:28.971
so be it.

892
00:47:29.638 --> 00:47:33.016
I have your signed agreement.
I'm just waiting to take it to the DA.

893
00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:35.519
And you're right about me
not winning any cases.

894
00:47:36.353 --> 00:47:39.273
or not even trying one for that matter.
but...

895
00:47:40.941 --> 00:47:43.360
most of my cases were simple misdemeanors

896
00:47:44.194 --> 00:47:46.071
or a few felonies that I pled out.

897
00:47:46.864 --> 00:47:49.283
But. Grace.
I've never met anyone like you.

898
00:47:49.575 --> 00:47:51.076
I never met anyone

899
00:47:51.577 --> 00:47:53.370
that I felt. in my heart.

900
00:47:54.037 --> 00:47:55.163
was innocent.

901
00:47:55.581 --> 00:47:57.791
even though you're telling me
you're guilty.

902
00:47:59.585 --> 00:48:02.379
You know. Grace.
I don't know how I can help you.

903
00:48:02.462 --> 00:48:04.923
But if you tell me what happened...

904
00:48:06.675 --> 00:48:08.927
I promise you I will try.

905
00:48:10.554 --> 00:48:12.639
Grace. please tell me what else happened.

906
00:48:15.726 --> 00:48:18.312
You stopped at him
asking you to marry him.

907
00:48:20.814 --> 00:48:22.149
We got married.

908
00:48:23.275 --> 00:48:24.818
And it was a whirlwind.

909
00:48:28.488 --> 00:48:31.408
It was the happiest time of my life.

910
00:48:31.491 --> 00:48:33.994
- <i>I was in love.</i>

911
00:48:34.828 --> 00:48:38.790
<i>He was everything I imagined</i>
<i>and wanted in a man.</i>

912
00:48:39.333 --> 00:48:42.544
<i>The way he spoke. the way he touched me.</i>

913
00:48:42.628 --> 00:48:44.671
<i>and the way he made love to me.</i>

914
00:48:45.464 --> 00:48:47.549
<i>When he held me. I felt so safe.</i>

915
00:48:47.633 --> 00:48:49.593
<i>-I thought. "How is this possible?</i>

916
00:48:49.676 --> 00:48:51.678
<i>Everyone should be this happy."</i>

917
00:48:51.762 --> 00:48:53.055
Baby girl.

918
00:48:53.138 --> 00:48:55.098
<i>He was wonderful.</i>

919
00:48:56.350 --> 00:48:57.893
<i>The man of my dreams.</i>

920
00:48:58.352 --> 00:49:00.187
-Come on.
-What have you done?

921
00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:01.480
Ah. you know what I've done.

922
00:49:01.563 --> 00:49:03.565
Wait. wait. wait. let me sit up.

923
00:49:03.857 --> 00:49:05.525
<i>He was so nice to me.</i>

924
00:49:05.609 --> 00:49:07.611
Oh. wow.

925
00:49:07.694 --> 00:49:08.904
<i>So sweet.</i>

926
00:49:08.987 --> 00:49:10.322
-You're welcome.
-Thank you.

927
00:49:10.405 --> 00:49:12.532
- <i>So kind.</i>

928
00:49:12.991 --> 00:49:15.869
<i>My life went from black-and-white</i>
<i>and routine...</i>

929
00:49:15.953 --> 00:49:18.372
<i>-...to happy and over-the-top.</i>

930
00:49:18.455 --> 00:49:19.414
Hey.

931
00:49:21.375 --> 00:49:22.459
Hold on. hon.

932
00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:25.504
I heard you like red.

933
00:49:25.587 --> 00:49:27.547
-Yes. I do. and I love roses.
- Those are for you.

934
00:49:27.631 --> 00:49:30.425
And...<i> </i>this is for me.

935
00:49:30.509 --> 00:49:31.343
Oh. no.

936
00:49:31.593 --> 00:49:32.511
- Oh. yes.
-No.

937
00:49:32.594 --> 00:49:33.470
Oh. yes.

938
00:49:33.762 --> 00:49:36.098
<i>But like watching a magic show.</i>

939
00:49:36.181 --> 00:49:38.600
<i>-I was so in love and so blinded</i>

940
00:49:38.684 --> 00:49:40.519
<i>by what he was showing me in his hands</i>

941
00:49:40.602 --> 00:49:44.064
<i>that I never looked at</i>
<i>what he was hiding behind his back.</i>

942
00:49:44.147 --> 00:49:45.816
Okay. okay. Stop.

943
00:49:47.943 --> 00:49:49.486
These are beautiful.

944
00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:50.904
So are you.

945
00:49:50.988 --> 00:49:53.365
Thank you.

946
00:49:54.658 --> 00:49:56.535
<i>But for all those happy days.</i>

947
00:49:56.743 --> 00:49:59.037
<i>I was in for twice as much hell.</i>

948
00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:04.960
<i>And it all started to fall apart</i>
<i>as quickly as it began.</i>

949
00:50:24.229 --> 00:50:25.063
No.

950
00:50:26.815 --> 00:50:27.774
Not yet.

951
00:50:28.692 --> 00:50:30.360
Did you enjoy the fireflies?

952
00:50:31.319 --> 00:50:34.197
-Who are you talking to?
-No. I can't wait to see you. too.

953
00:50:37.034 --> 00:50:38.660
Yeah. I'll call you tomorrow.

954
00:50:39.995 --> 00:50:42.122
-Bye.

955
00:50:45.417 --> 00:50:46.626
Who were you talking to?

956
00:50:53.383 --> 00:50:54.259
Grace.

957
00:50:55.093 --> 00:50:55.927
Yeah?

958
00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:03.727
There's two things I don't like.

959
00:51:06.146 --> 00:51:06.980
Okay.

960
00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:10.067
One is being checked up on...

961
00:51:14.446 --> 00:51:16.156
and the other's being questioned.

962
00:51:20.035 --> 00:51:20.952
Okay.

963
00:51:23.538 --> 00:51:26.124
I just... I just missed you.

964
00:51:32.714 --> 00:51:33.757
I miss you. too.

965
00:51:50.816 --> 00:51:53.902
Why did he have to go downstairs
to have the conversation?

966
00:51:54.444 --> 00:51:56.238
<i>And then he got so defensive.</i>

967
00:51:56.613 --> 00:51:59.574
That's just men sometimes.
It's probably nothing.

968
00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:02.119
Or it could be another woman.

969
00:52:02.202 --> 00:52:03.495
You know what. Sarah?

970
00:52:05.038 --> 00:52:06.832
This all happened so fast.

971
00:52:06.915 --> 00:52:09.626
<i>Okay. don't go making a mountain</i>
<i>out of a molehill.</i>

972
00:52:09.709 --> 00:52:12.587
Okay? It's probably nothing.

973
00:52:13.171 --> 00:52:14.047
Miss Waters?

974
00:52:14.131 --> 00:52:15.841
Hold on. Yes?

975
00:52:15.924 --> 00:52:18.802
Mr. Clyde would like to see you
in the conference room right away. please.

976
00:52:19.386 --> 00:52:21.096
Okay. Thank you.

977
00:52:21.179 --> 00:52:22.264
Mm-hmm.

978
00:52:22.347 --> 00:52:25.475
-Hey. Sarah. I gotta go.
<i>-</i><i> Why you gotta go. baby?</i>

979
00:52:25.559 --> 00:52:28.186
- <i>My boss wants to see me.</i>
-Oh.

980
00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:30.105
Okay. talk to you later.

981
00:52:34.151 --> 00:52:35.986
<i>I thought it was strange</i>
<i>that my boss</i>

982
00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:39.030
<i>and all the corporate officers</i>
<i>wanted to see me in the middle of the day.</i>

983
00:52:39.114 --> 00:52:42.409
<i>I had no idea of the bombshell</i>
<i>he would drop.</i>

984
00:52:42.492 --> 00:52:44.161
Mr. Clyde. you wanted to see me?

985
00:52:45.954 --> 00:52:48.623
We just completed an internal audit
of your department.

986
00:52:48.707 --> 00:52:52.752
$379.000 is missing from your accounts.

987
00:52:52.836 --> 00:52:54.462
Well. there has to be some mistake.

988
00:52:54.546 --> 00:52:58.175
It was signed for with your company ID.
your password.

989
00:52:58.258 --> 00:53:00.635
your computer's IP. your laptop.

990
00:53:00.719 --> 00:53:02.637
your name. your codes.

991
00:53:03.096 --> 00:53:05.140
What is wrong with you. Grace?

992
00:53:06.141 --> 00:53:09.519
You thought that we wouldn't notice
that kind of money being moved?

993
00:53:09.603 --> 00:53:11.855
-No. Mr. Clyde. I-I never--
- You're fired!

994
00:53:12.564 --> 00:53:13.565
You're fired.

995
00:53:13.648 --> 00:53:16.067
<i>I couldn't find words to defend myself.</i>

996
00:53:16.151 --> 00:53:18.695
I want that money.
or you're going to jail.

997
00:53:18.778 --> 00:53:21.990
Now please leave
before I have security escort you out.

998
00:53:22.073 --> 00:53:25.577
<i> I was just so shocked</i>
<i>that he would treat me like that.</i>

999
00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:26.828
<i>They knew me!</i>

1000
00:53:27.329 --> 00:53:28.705
<i>I couldn't believe this.</i>

1001
00:53:28.788 --> 00:53:31.958
<i>I had worked for this company for years.</i>

1002
00:53:32.042 --> 00:53:34.127
<i>It had helped me have a good life.</i>

1003
00:53:34.211 --> 00:53:37.130
<i>and they were throwing me out</i>
<i>for something I didn't do.</i>

1004
00:53:38.256 --> 00:53:39.758
<i>Something I would never do.</i>

1005
00:53:40.717 --> 00:53:42.052
<i>It was horrible.</i>

1006
00:53:42.844 --> 00:53:44.638
<i>I felt sick to my stomach.</i>

1007
00:53:45.222 --> 00:53:48.099
<i>But little did I know</i>
<i>the worst was yet to come.</i>

1008
00:53:50.518 --> 00:53:51.937
-He's not answering?
-No.

1009
00:53:52.896 --> 00:53:55.899
He's probably with whoever the hell
he was talking to on the phone.

1010
00:53:57.234 --> 00:53:58.318
I can't believe this.

1011
00:53:58.818 --> 00:53:59.945
We just got married.

1012
00:54:00.028 --> 00:54:01.863
and he probably with some other woman.
and I'm sitting up here.

1013
00:54:01.947 --> 00:54:03.823
trying to figure out
what to do about this mess!

1014
00:54:03.907 --> 00:54:05.367
Grace. Grace. come on now.

1015
00:54:05.450 --> 00:54:07.994
Calm down.
and tell me how you think this happened.

1016
00:54:08.078 --> 00:54:09.412
I don't know. Sarah.

1017
00:54:10.705 --> 00:54:11.623
I don't know.

1018
00:54:13.041 --> 00:54:14.376
-I mean.

1019
00:54:14.459 --> 00:54:15.919
maybe somebody's trying--

1020
00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:19.756
-Somebody stole my identity. I don't know.

1021
00:54:22.676 --> 00:54:23.718
Hey.

1022
00:54:24.427 --> 00:54:25.428
Where you been?

1023
00:54:25.512 --> 00:54:27.931
-I've been calling you for hours.
-Have you?

1024
00:54:28.473 --> 00:54:29.349
Yeah.

1025
00:54:30.433 --> 00:54:32.394
-I was. uh--
-With your new woman?

1026
00:54:34.854 --> 00:54:37.023
You take her to the fireflies
like you did me?

1027
00:54:38.149 --> 00:54:39.401
Wow.

1028
00:54:41.069 --> 00:54:43.488
Sarah. would you excuse us
for a second. please?

1029
00:54:45.615 --> 00:54:47.284
No. I'm not going anywhere.

1030
00:54:48.285 --> 00:54:49.869
I'd like to talk to my wife.

1031
00:54:51.955 --> 00:54:53.873
I'm not going anywhere.

1032
00:54:56.751 --> 00:54:57.919
So. this is what you wanna do?

1033
00:54:58.003 --> 00:55:00.171
You wanna talk to me like this
in front of your friend?

1034
00:55:01.131 --> 00:55:02.674
<i>Her</i> friend.

1035
00:55:03.508 --> 00:55:05.010
And you remember that.

1036
00:55:05.093 --> 00:55:06.720
It's all right. Sarah.

1037
00:55:07.304 --> 00:55:08.346
You sure?

1038
00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:09.556
Yeah.

1039
00:55:10.348 --> 00:55:11.182
Go on.

1040
00:55:12.434 --> 00:55:13.310
All right.

1041
00:55:14.436 --> 00:55:15.312
Okay.

1042
00:55:15.395 --> 00:55:17.105
-You call me.
-Yeah.

1043
00:55:22.444 --> 00:55:23.570
So. who is she?

1044
00:55:23.987 --> 00:55:24.821
Who is who?

1045
00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:26.239
The woman.

1046
00:55:26.698 --> 00:55:27.824
Did you take her?

1047
00:55:28.325 --> 00:55:30.035
'Cause I heard you on the phone.

1048
00:55:54.309 --> 00:55:55.810
I was talking to the nurses.

1049
00:55:58.855 --> 00:56:00.857
The head nurse. she's 60.

1050
00:56:01.441 --> 00:56:03.818
I set up this photo shoot with the kids.

1051
00:56:04.861 --> 00:56:06.071
Kind of did it for you.

1052
00:56:08.656 --> 00:56:09.949
They have cancer. Grace.

1053
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:13.119
I figured you'd like the shoot because...

1054
00:56:14.329 --> 00:56:15.914
that's where I proposed to you.

1055
00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:22.837
You know what's not gonna happen?

1056
00:56:25.715 --> 00:56:27.592
Because we already discussed this.

1057
00:56:29.928 --> 00:56:32.305
I'm not gonna sit here and be acc--
You know what? Fuck this.

1058
00:56:32.389 --> 00:56:34.224
Wait. baby. I'm sorry.

1059
00:56:34.307 --> 00:56:35.433
I'm sorry.

1060
00:56:35.683 --> 00:56:36.559
I'm sorry.

1061
00:56:38.603 --> 00:56:41.356
Listen. I just had one of the worst days
of my life.

1062
00:56:42.273 --> 00:56:43.316
I got fired.

1063
00:56:46.194 --> 00:56:47.362
-Fired?
- Yeah.

1064
00:56:48.738 --> 00:56:50.156
I don't know what happened.

1065
00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:53.201
but somebody got into my accounts.
they got my passwords...

1066
00:56:54.494 --> 00:56:55.412
I don't know.

1067
00:56:56.579 --> 00:56:59.833
-I don't know what to do.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. baby.

1068
00:57:00.834 --> 00:57:04.546
I mean.
I've been calling the banks all day.

1069
00:57:04.629 --> 00:57:08.216
I-I think-- I think somebody maybe...

1070
00:57:08.299 --> 00:57:10.093
Maybe somebody stole my identity.

1071
00:57:10.176 --> 00:57:13.054
-Baby. I don't know what to do.
-Baby. it's okay. it's okay. Okay?

1072
00:57:13.138 --> 00:57:14.222
Look. we're gonna handle it.

1073
00:57:14.305 --> 00:57:15.557
-Okay.
-I'm here.

1074
00:57:16.808 --> 00:57:17.642
I'm sorry.

1075
00:57:17.725 --> 00:57:20.270
No. I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry this happened.

1076
00:57:20.353 --> 00:57:22.897
We're gonna make it right.
Just tell me who call.

1077
00:57:24.649 --> 00:57:27.819
I don't know... start t-trying to call

1078
00:57:27.902 --> 00:57:29.988
my credit accounts
or something like that.

1079
00:57:30.071 --> 00:57:31.614
-I don't know who all to call.
-Okay.

1080
00:57:31.698 --> 00:57:33.366
Maybe I'll try to call the IRS.
I don't know.

1081
00:57:33.450 --> 00:57:34.993
-We'll figure it out together.
- Okay.

1082
00:57:36.035 --> 00:57:38.204
-This is...
-Just breathe. just breathe.

1083
00:57:38.288 --> 00:57:40.540
-Come here. breathe.
-Thank you.<i> </i>

1084
00:57:40.623 --> 00:57:42.667
-<i> He was so...</i>
-I'm sorry.

1085
00:57:42.750 --> 00:57:44.419
<i>...concerned.</i>

1086
00:57:44.502 --> 00:57:45.837
-Come on. Let's call 'em.
-Okay.

1087
00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:46.754
We gotta get this.

1088
00:57:46.838 --> 00:57:49.382
<i>We stayed up most of the night</i>
<i>trying to figure out what happened.</i>

1089
00:57:49.466 --> 00:57:50.967
Who do you got? Who you got?

1090
00:57:51.050 --> 00:57:53.261
Uh. the IRS again. Let me try...

1091
00:57:53.344 --> 00:57:55.722
<i>The next morning.</i>
<i>I got up really early</i>

1092
00:57:55.805 --> 00:57:56.973
<i>and called the police.</i>

1093
00:57:57.515 --> 00:58:00.143
<i>-They were no help at all. so...</i>
-Is there anything you can do?

1094
00:58:00.226 --> 00:58:01.394
<i>...I went to the bank.</i>

1095
00:58:01.478 --> 00:58:03.688
I'm sorry. is this your signature?

1096
00:58:03.771 --> 00:58:05.648
It matches your signature card.

1097
00:58:05.732 --> 00:58:08.359
Well. it looks like mine.
but. uh. what is that?

1098
00:58:08.443 --> 00:58:10.361
-'Cause I didn't sign it.
- Oh.

1099
00:58:10.904 --> 00:58:13.948
We need to know when you can make
the payment on your mortgage.

1100
00:58:14.407 --> 00:58:15.909
It's 30 days behind.

1101
00:58:15.992 --> 00:58:16.826
What mortgage?

1102
00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:19.537
My house has been paid for
for over four years.

1103
00:58:19.621 --> 00:58:20.830
Well. it was.

1104
00:58:20.914 --> 00:58:26.044
and then you took out a $375.000 mortgage

1105
00:58:26.127 --> 00:58:27.879
exactly 42 days ago.

1106
00:58:27.962 --> 00:58:29.339
What are you talking about?

1107
00:58:29.422 --> 00:58:31.799
The payments were set up
as direct withdrawal.

1108
00:58:31.883 --> 00:58:34.886
and your account is now overdrawn by...

1109
00:58:34.969 --> 00:58:36.012
$4.600.

1110
00:58:36.095 --> 00:58:39.015
Wait a minute.

1111
00:58:41.851 --> 00:58:43.186
This can't be right.

1112
00:58:45.313 --> 00:58:46.356
Wait a minute.

1113
00:58:48.274 --> 00:58:49.442
I didn't do this.

1114
00:58:49.526 --> 00:58:51.945
But as I was trying to tell
one of your tellers.

1115
00:58:52.028 --> 00:58:55.823
I think that somebody
has stolen my identity.

1116
00:58:56.533 --> 00:58:59.244
See. because how is this kind of stuff
even possible?

1117
00:58:59.327 --> 00:59:01.871
'Cause I didn't sign this.
and I never came in here.

1118
00:59:01.955 --> 00:59:02.872
This was not me.

1119
00:59:02.956 --> 00:59:04.207
It was notarized.

1120
00:59:04.582 --> 00:59:05.542
By whom?

1121
00:59:06.084 --> 00:59:08.753
Uh... Flynch Notary.

1122
00:59:08.836 --> 00:59:11.631
Hold on. can I just borrow this
for a minute? Excuse me.

1123
00:59:11.923 --> 00:59:14.300
-Flynch Notary.
-Flynch Notary.

1124
00:59:14.384 --> 00:59:15.385
-Mm-hmm.
-Um...

1125
00:59:15.468 --> 00:59:21.558
-the address is 2989 Sycamore Street.
-2989... Sycamore Street.

1126
00:59:21.641 --> 00:59:22.725
Lord. have mercy.

1127
00:59:24.018 --> 00:59:25.770
What is going on?

1128
00:59:25.853 --> 00:59:27.939
I'm sorry.
but while we look into this.

1129
00:59:28.022 --> 00:59:31.025
we're gonna need a payment
so your house doesn't go into foreclosure.

1130
00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.985
Okay.

1131
00:59:33.152 --> 00:59:34.362
What is going on?

1132
00:59:35.446 --> 00:59:36.990
<i>I went to Sycamore Street.</i>

1133
00:59:37.615 --> 00:59:39.784
<i>and it was an old. abandoned house.</i>

1134
00:59:40.243 --> 00:59:42.161
<i>The mail was piling up. It was...</i>

1135
00:59:42.954 --> 00:59:45.582
<i>All of it was addressed to somebody</i>
<i>named A. McKathy.</i>

1136
00:59:46.332 --> 00:59:50.461
<i>I was just upset that some stranger</i>
<i>would do this to me.</i>

1137
00:59:50.545 --> 00:59:52.088
<i>It was horrible.</i>

1138
00:59:52.171 --> 00:59:53.339
<i>I went back to the bank</i>

1139
00:59:53.423 --> 00:59:55.675
<i>to get video surveillance. and...</i>
<i>and. well...</i>

1140
00:59:56.843 --> 01:00:00.054
<i>That's when everything I knew shattered.</i>

1141
01:00:05.351 --> 01:00:06.394
You did it.

1142
01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:09.856
What?

1143
01:00:13.901 --> 01:00:14.777
You okay?

1144
01:00:15.737 --> 01:00:16.613
You did it.

1145
01:00:18.031 --> 01:00:18.990
Did what?

1146
01:00:19.324 --> 01:00:20.617
You went to my bank.

1147
01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:23.620
and you took out a mortgage on my house.

1148
01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:28.708
Grace...
I don't know what you're talking about.

1149
01:00:29.375 --> 01:00:30.543
Check your cell.

1150
01:01:02.867 --> 01:01:04.369
Grace...<i> </i>

1151
01:01:05.787 --> 01:01:07.747
I needed the money. Grace.

1152
01:01:09.791 --> 01:01:13.169
And what kind of man
wants to ask his woman for money?

1153
01:01:14.128 --> 01:01:15.088
I mean. come on.

1154
01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:19.676
I had debts that had to be paid
by some people

1155
01:01:19.759 --> 01:01:21.678
that are not to be messed with.

1156
01:01:22.178 --> 01:01:24.722
And I just thought
because we're partners. we're married.

1157
01:01:24.806 --> 01:01:26.057
-so I just figured that...
-Mm-mm.

1158
01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:27.308
you'd want me to have it.

1159
01:01:27.392 --> 01:01:30.311
- Why don't you--
-Oh. my God.

1160
01:01:33.022 --> 01:01:34.649
-You stole the money from my job. too.
- I did not.

1161
01:01:34.732 --> 01:01:36.484
-Yes. you did!
-I'll pay you back. I'm gonna--

1162
01:01:36.567 --> 01:01:37.652
My accounts?

1163
01:01:38.486 --> 01:01:40.029
My-- My-- My passwords?

1164
01:01:41.114 --> 01:01:42.448
You did that. Shannon?

1165
01:01:43.282 --> 01:01:44.492
You did that.

1166
01:01:47.161 --> 01:01:48.037
No.

1167
01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:50.248
N-No.

1168
01:01:52.166 --> 01:01:54.627
I want you to give me back...

1169
01:01:55.628 --> 01:01:56.713
all that money.

1170
01:02:00.007 --> 01:02:03.219
I can go to jail.

1171
01:02:04.095 --> 01:02:05.847
Where-- Where is it?

1172
01:02:06.305 --> 01:02:09.100
I need you to give me back that money.

1173
01:02:11.185 --> 01:02:12.979
-I can't.
- What the hell?

1174
01:02:13.062 --> 01:02:13.938
It's mine now.

1175
01:02:14.021 --> 01:02:16.524
What the fuck are you talkin' about?

1176
01:02:17.024 --> 01:02:18.776
Do you know the laws of this state?

1177
01:02:20.987 --> 01:02:22.113
Because I do.

1178
01:02:24.449 --> 01:02:26.242
And as your lawfully wedded husband.

1179
01:02:26.325 --> 01:02:29.203
-I have every fucking right to that money!

1180
01:02:31.873 --> 01:02:33.374
You lucky I got two phones.

1181
01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:36.502
<i> He was talkin'.</i>
<i>and I didn't hear anything.</i>

1182
01:02:37.128 --> 01:02:38.546
<i>I couldn't believe this.</i>

1183
01:02:39.046 --> 01:02:41.299
<i>-I had been conned.</i>

1184
01:02:41.382 --> 01:02:43.384
<i>All of it was a lie.</i>

1185
01:02:43.968 --> 01:02:47.221
<i>I knew it. but my brain couldn't process</i>
<i>what he had done.</i>

1186
01:02:48.264 --> 01:02:50.767
<i>There I was with nothing.</i>

1187
01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:53.186
<i>He had taken every bit of it.</i>

1188
01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:55.855
<i>and I was so lost.</i>

1189
01:02:56.355 --> 01:02:59.442
<i>How could this sweet. loving man</i>

1190
01:02:59.525 --> 01:03:03.571
<i>become this cold. calculating demon</i>
<i>in no time?</i>

1191
01:03:03.946 --> 01:03:07.116
<i>I was beyond hurt by the betrayal.</i>

1192
01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.202
I want you out of my house.

1193
01:03:10.119 --> 01:03:13.122
I want you out of my house.
and I want you out of my house.<i> </i>now.

1194
01:03:13.206 --> 01:03:14.540
And I want an ashtray.

1195
01:03:17.001 --> 01:03:18.419
You son of a bitch.

1196
01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:25.927
<i>He was laughing at me.</i>

1197
01:03:26.010 --> 01:03:28.888
You keep saying <i>"your </i>house."

1198
01:03:29.138 --> 01:03:31.474
That marriage license says <i>our </i>house.

1199
01:03:31.557 --> 01:03:33.601
<i>It was bad enough</i>
<i>that he had taken all my money.</i>

1200
01:03:33.684 --> 01:03:34.977
<i>but here he was laughin'.</i>

1201
01:03:35.061 --> 01:03:36.854
-You watch.
-I'm watchin'.

1202
01:03:37.855 --> 01:03:38.898
Ashtray.

1203
01:03:41.275 --> 01:03:42.527
Ashtray. bitch!

1204
01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:44.153
<i>And he wouldn't leave.</i>

1205
01:03:44.237 --> 01:03:46.531
<i>I called the police.</i>
<i>I told them everything.</i>

1206
01:03:46.781 --> 01:03:49.951
He does not own this house.
I've owned this house for four years.

1207
01:03:50.034 --> 01:03:52.078
<i>They told me</i>
<i>that there was nothing they could do.</i>

1208
01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:55.414
<i>and that I needed a lawyer</i>
<i>because this was a civil matter.</i>

1209
01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:57.834
<i>Sarah recommended a lawyer.</i>
<i>and we went to see him.</i>

1210
01:03:57.917 --> 01:03:59.085
Ten thousand dollars?

1211
01:03:59.168 --> 01:04:02.755
<i>The attorney told me</i>
<i>that his retainer was $10.000.</i>

1212
01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:05.758
<i>and it could be as long as two years</i>
<i>to get to court.</i>

1213
01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:08.052
He's already taken so much-- Sarah.

1214
01:04:08.135 --> 01:04:09.512
<i>My hands were tied.</i>

1215
01:04:09.595 --> 01:04:13.432
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>
<i>I was just so outdone.</i>

1216
01:04:13.641 --> 01:04:14.934
Oh. my God.

1217
01:04:50.303 --> 01:04:51.262
Not yet.

1218
01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:00.855
Mm!

1219
01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:11.616
Shannon. get your black ass
out of my motherfucking house!

1220
01:05:12.283 --> 01:05:13.200
I mean it!

1221
01:05:13.284 --> 01:05:16.370
-Respect my motherfucking privacy!
-You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch!

1222
01:05:16.454 --> 01:05:17.371
Get some goddamn locks

1223
01:05:17.455 --> 01:05:19.373
-on these doors.
-You black-ass bastard!

1224
01:05:19.457 --> 01:05:20.791
You son of a bitch!

1225
01:05:21.626 --> 01:05:22.627
What?

1226
01:05:24.462 --> 01:05:26.464
So. you brought me to your mom's house?

1227
01:05:27.048 --> 01:05:29.800
-My momma live better than that.

1228
01:05:29.884 --> 01:05:31.177
-Where were we?
- Come on.

1229
01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:33.512
-Mm! Okay.
- Don't worry about it.

1230
01:05:33.679 --> 01:05:34.889
Mm!

1231
01:05:37.099 --> 01:05:38.726
<i>Then it washed over me.</i>

1232
01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:42.396
<i> I went numb.</i>

1233
01:05:45.149 --> 01:05:48.069
<i>You ever had that numb feeling?</i>

1234
01:05:49.445 --> 01:05:51.989
<i>Like what's going on with you</i>
<i>can't be real?</i>

1235
01:05:53.866 --> 01:05:55.242
<i>It just can't be.</i>

1236
01:05:57.828 --> 01:06:01.415
<i>I couldn't believe that I was this age</i>

1237
01:06:01.499 --> 01:06:03.501
<i>and I let this happen to me.</i>

1238
01:06:05.086 --> 01:06:07.088
-That was great.
-Mm-hmm.

1239
01:06:07.171 --> 01:06:09.215
-Will I see you again?

1240
01:06:10.424 --> 01:06:12.718
Yeah. if your mom
don't break in on us again.

1241
01:06:14.053 --> 01:06:15.012
She won't.

1242
01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:20.309
<i>Was I that stupid</i>
<i>that I would let this happen?</i>

1243
01:06:23.437 --> 01:06:24.271
<i>Not me.</i>

1244
01:06:26.732 --> 01:06:27.984
<i>I'm educated</i>

1245
01:06:28.943 --> 01:06:29.986
<i>and smart.</i>

1246
01:06:33.531 --> 01:06:36.200
<i>Was I that lonely...</i>

1247
01:06:37.743 --> 01:06:39.912
<i>...that I would let this fool</i>

1248
01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:41.831
<i>take advantage of me?</i>

1249
01:06:42.832 --> 01:06:44.291
<i>I didn't understand it.</i>

1250
01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:48.254
Should've joined us.

1251
01:06:54.719 --> 01:06:56.137
That look killed me. baby.

1252
01:06:59.056 --> 01:07:00.016
Aw.

1253
01:07:03.352 --> 01:07:05.354
It's kind of like
the same one you got now.

1254
01:07:07.231 --> 01:07:09.358
Shannon. please give me my money.

1255
01:07:11.736 --> 01:07:12.570
What?

1256
01:07:14.989 --> 01:07:16.073
I'm looking at

1257
01:07:16.949 --> 01:07:19.702
-being prosecuted by my job.

1258
01:07:20.995 --> 01:07:22.913
-Grace. again with that?
-Give me my money.

1259
01:07:22.997 --> 01:07:24.206
-Please.
-Grace. Grace. Grace.

1260
01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:25.791
Grace. Grace. Grace. Grace.

1261
01:07:30.171 --> 01:07:31.756
Now. the way I look at it...

1262
01:07:35.926 --> 01:07:37.386
you owe me that money.

1263
01:07:38.846 --> 01:07:40.848
Yeah. I mean. think about it.

1264
01:07:42.850 --> 01:07:44.143
All the sex...

1265
01:07:45.352 --> 01:07:48.689
and the joy I brought
to your miserable fucking life!

1266
01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:52.234
Yeah.

1267
01:07:54.153 --> 01:07:55.112
You owe me.

1268
01:08:02.078 --> 01:08:02.912
I mean...<i> </i>um...

1269
01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:05.915
I don't mean to yell.

1270
01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:11.045
You're a nice lady. Grace.

1271
01:08:13.547 --> 01:08:15.007
You're a very nice lady.

1272
01:08:17.718 --> 01:08:19.595
One of the nicest I ever met. really.

1273
01:08:24.642 --> 01:08:28.187
That's why it's been so hard for me
to do this.

1274
01:08:33.442 --> 01:08:34.318
Yeah.

1275
01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:37.738
I guess the nicest thing I can do
is tell you the truth.

1276
01:08:47.123 --> 01:08:48.332
You see. I love you.

1277
01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:53.129
I really do love you. I...

1278
01:08:55.339 --> 01:08:58.467
I'm just never gonna love you
the same way that you love me.

1279
01:09:05.516 --> 01:09:07.351
And women your age. you know...

1280
01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:09.436
How's the phrase go?

1281
01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:11.313
Low-hanging fruit.

1282
01:09:12.565 --> 01:09:13.399
Single.

1283
01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:16.402
Vulnerable.

1284
01:09:18.696 --> 01:09:19.530
Lonely.

1285
01:09:21.198 --> 01:09:22.408
Fuckin' weak.

1286
01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:27.454
I mean. if you think about it...

1287
01:09:29.248 --> 01:09:31.667
it's your fuckin' fault.
You made this too easy.

1288
01:09:36.547 --> 01:09:37.590
But you don't think.

1289
01:09:48.767 --> 01:09:49.602
Grace. I'm hun--

1290
01:10:33.437 --> 01:10:35.981
<i>I couldn't believe that I had killed him.</i>

1291
01:10:57.753 --> 01:10:59.964
<i>I got in my car.</i>
<i>and I just drove...</i>

1292
01:11:01.674 --> 01:11:02.967
<i>and drove.</i>

1293
01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:06.595
<i>Before I knew it.</i>
<i>I was in the middle of nowhere.</i>

1294
01:11:06.679 --> 01:11:07.638
Sarah.

1295
01:11:10.349 --> 01:11:12.309
He's in my basement.

1296
01:11:15.437 --> 01:11:16.730
I killed him.

1297
01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:20.985
You told Sarah you killed him?

1298
01:11:21.318 --> 01:11:22.152
Yes.

1299
01:11:22.236 --> 01:11:24.446
-And you didn't remove the body?
- No.

1300
01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:26.031
I left him there.

1301
01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:29.368
Sarah went to the house.

1302
01:11:29.451 --> 01:11:31.287
Then she called me and told me

1303
01:11:31.829 --> 01:11:33.205
there wasn't a body.

1304
01:11:34.623 --> 01:11:35.666
He was gone.

1305
01:11:36.917 --> 01:11:39.003
Wait. are you telling me he's not dead?

1306
01:11:39.086 --> 01:11:40.838
No. I know he's dead.

1307
01:11:41.547 --> 01:11:43.299
-But he wasn't there.

1308
01:11:44.425 --> 01:11:45.426
Time's up.

1309
01:11:47.928 --> 01:11:49.430
Grace. where was the body?

1310
01:11:50.597 --> 01:11:51.932
Where was he?

1311
01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:54.518
I don't know.

1312
01:11:57.730 --> 01:12:00.024
<i>You didn't tell me</i>
<i>she told you she killed him.</i>

1313
01:12:00.107 --> 01:12:02.609
You can't keep this kind of thing from me.
Sarah.

1314
01:12:02.693 --> 01:12:03.819
I'm trying to help her.

1315
01:12:03.902 --> 01:12:06.655
and this is the kind of information
that I need to know.

1316
01:12:07.323 --> 01:12:08.699
So you went to her house?

1317
01:12:09.575 --> 01:12:10.576
Yes.

1318
01:12:11.327 --> 01:12:12.828
And what happened when you got there?

1319
01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:19.752
There is nothing you can say
that I can use against her.

1320
01:12:20.627 --> 01:12:21.462
Okay?

1321
01:12:22.755 --> 01:12:24.798
It's not just her I'm worried about.

1322
01:12:26.258 --> 01:12:27.343
Who?

1323
01:12:28.135 --> 01:12:30.804
If you knew something
and you didn't tell the police.

1324
01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:33.182
that's a crime. right?

1325
01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:36.727
If the DA knew this. then. yes.

1326
01:12:37.853 --> 01:12:39.063
You would be charged.

1327
01:12:40.606 --> 01:12:41.648
Not me.

1328
01:12:42.566 --> 01:12:43.984
Her son. Malcolm.

1329
01:12:44.443 --> 01:12:45.569
He was there.

1330
01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:47.863
Malcolm?

1331
01:12:49.073 --> 01:12:51.325
<i>Well. did he say anything?</i>

1332
01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:53.744
<i>Did you see anything unusual?</i>

1333
01:12:53.827 --> 01:12:56.330
<i>He was just a little agitated. and...</i>

1334
01:12:56.413 --> 01:12:58.957
it was quick. you know?
He-- He just drove away.

1335
01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:01.335
Well. what happened
when you got in the house?

1336
01:13:01.418 --> 01:13:05.047
I went down to the basement.
but there was no body there.

1337
01:13:05.756 --> 01:13:08.884
There was just blood everywhere.
all over the basement stairs.

1338
01:13:09.843 --> 01:13:11.387
What do you think happened?

1339
01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:12.805
I think Malcolm...

1340
01:13:13.931 --> 01:13:15.933
took the body before I got there...

1341
01:13:16.850 --> 01:13:17.684
or...

1342
01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:21.647
Or if Grace was in a state of shock.

1343
01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:24.525
she might have dragged that body up
and put it in the back of her car.

1344
01:13:24.608 --> 01:13:26.860
drove out to the country.
and dumped it somewhere.

1345
01:13:26.944 --> 01:13:29.905
Mm-mm. No. no. No. no. She didn't do that.

1346
01:13:31.448 --> 01:13:32.324
I believe her.

1347
01:13:33.867 --> 01:13:35.786
I just love her so much.

1348
01:13:38.455 --> 01:13:40.124
I'm sorry. Miss Sarah.

1349
01:13:40.207 --> 01:13:42.000
I just... I...

1350
01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:44.169
You did all you could for her. Miss Sarah.

1351
01:13:47.464 --> 01:13:49.925
- It's all right. It's all right.
-I'm so sorry. Miss Sarah.

1352
01:13:50.884 --> 01:13:53.178
-I'll fix it.
- Okay. okay.

1353
01:13:54.138 --> 01:13:56.515
Now we know why she wants to plead guilty.

1354
01:13:57.224 --> 01:13:58.100
Why?

1355
01:13:59.518 --> 01:14:00.894
To protect her son.

1356
01:14:03.063 --> 01:14:03.897
Oh...

1357
01:14:07.025 --> 01:14:09.570
- Baby. you coming to bed?
-In a little bit.

1358
01:14:09.653 --> 01:14:12.489
Oh. babe. when you get to work tomorrow.
can you look up Shannon Delong.

1359
01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:14.450
without anybody noticing?

1360
01:14:14.533 --> 01:14:16.034
Uh. I really shouldn't do that.

1361
01:14:16.577 --> 01:14:17.411
Please?

1362
01:14:20.372 --> 01:14:21.832
Okay. I'll see what I can do.

1363
01:14:21.915 --> 01:14:23.709
-Thank you.

1364
01:14:28.255 --> 01:14:31.175
So you see.
she's trying to protect her son and Sarah.

1365
01:14:31.258 --> 01:14:33.260
- Mm.
- Now I need your help.

1366
01:14:34.094 --> 01:14:35.512
Jasmine. my office.

1367
01:14:36.889 --> 01:14:39.433
Meet me at my house at 7:00.
both of you. okay?

1368
01:14:39.516 --> 01:14:40.642
All right.

1369
01:14:41.226 --> 01:14:42.936
She's really gonna defend her.

1370
01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:45.981
Yeah. not if Mr. Rory Plea-Deal
has anything to say about it.

1371
01:14:46.064 --> 01:14:47.149
- You right.
- Hm.

1372
01:14:47.232 --> 01:14:49.401
I got it. Thanks.

1373
01:14:49.818 --> 01:14:51.111
That was the DA's office.

1374
01:14:51.195 --> 01:14:53.739
You wanna tell me why they don't have
the plea from Grace Waters yet?

1375
01:14:54.615 --> 01:14:57.534
There's been a change of events.
She doesn't want to plead guilty.

1376
01:14:57.618 --> 01:14:59.161
She wants to try the case.

1377
01:14:59.244 --> 01:15:01.121
She can't afford to go to trial.

1378
01:15:01.205 --> 01:15:03.707
This office cannot afford to go to trial.

1379
01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:06.210
What are you gonna do? You gonna plead.
It's three weeks away.

1380
01:15:06.293 --> 01:15:07.794
Is that what you're planning on doing?

1381
01:15:07.878 --> 01:15:08.879
-Yes.
- Ah.

1382
01:15:09.463 --> 01:15:10.297
That's great.

1383
01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:13.258
Now all of a sudden you want to be
this hero and you want to try a case?

1384
01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:14.927
You're not ready. I've been watching you.

1385
01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:16.887
I gave you this for a reason. you plea.

1386
01:15:16.970 --> 01:15:19.556
Here's what you're gonna do.
You're gonna go down to that jailhouse.

1387
01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:21.183
and you're gonna get her
to sign that plea.

1388
01:15:21.266 --> 01:15:22.392
and you're gonna get it done.

1389
01:15:23.852 --> 01:15:26.480
Never mind. I'll do it.
I'll do it. Thanks.

1390
01:15:29.691 --> 01:15:31.902
Grace. I don't have a lot of time. Now...

1391
01:15:31.985 --> 01:15:35.781
I think we have enough reasonable doubt
to get that into the jury's mind.

1392
01:15:35.864 --> 01:15:37.199
and that means an acquittal.

1393
01:15:37.824 --> 01:15:39.409
Did the DA take the deal?

1394
01:15:39.493 --> 01:15:41.495
No. no. no. No. listen to me.

1395
01:15:42.037 --> 01:15:45.457
I know Sarah and your son
were at the house the day he died.

1396
01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:47.000
Who told you that?

1397
01:15:48.043 --> 01:15:49.419
This is my mess.

1398
01:15:49.503 --> 01:15:53.507
I dragged them into this.
and I will not let my son go to jail.

1399
01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:55.425
Did your son help you get rid of the body?

1400
01:15:55.509 --> 01:15:58.428
No. he did not.
and don't you ever ask me that again.

1401
01:15:58.595 --> 01:16:00.264
Okay. look.
my boss is gonna walk

1402
01:16:00.347 --> 01:16:01.640
into that door any minute.

1403
01:16:01.723 --> 01:16:04.434
and I need you to tell him
that you have changed your mind.

1404
01:16:04.518 --> 01:16:05.769
and you do not want a plea.

1405
01:16:05.852 --> 01:16:10.315
The only thing I asked the DA to do
was to put me in a prison close to my son.

1406
01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:12.025
and you want me to jeopardize that? No!

1407
01:16:12.109 --> 01:16:14.486
-But what if you go free?
-You can't do that.

1408
01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:17.406
Yeah. I know I can't
if you don't let me fight for you!

1409
01:16:17.614 --> 01:16:19.908
Please. let me fight for you!

1410
01:16:20.534 --> 01:16:22.536
-I can do it.

1411
01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:28.834
Jasmine. I had a feeling you'd be here.

1412
01:16:28.917 --> 01:16:29.751
Hi.

1413
01:16:31.128 --> 01:16:33.797
My name is Rory Garraux.
I'm Jasmine's boss.

1414
01:16:34.381 --> 01:16:37.342
And I think that she's been giving you
some misleading information.

1415
01:16:38.093 --> 01:16:39.094
I'd like you to understand something.

1416
01:16:39.177 --> 01:16:41.221
My office has looked at your case
up and down.

1417
01:16:41.305 --> 01:16:44.641
and we think a plea is a good idea.
That way. you can be near your son.

1418
01:16:44.725 --> 01:16:46.602
I know that's important to you. yes?

1419
01:16:47.811 --> 01:16:50.314
So my purpose here today is to find out

1420
01:16:50.397 --> 01:16:52.941
if it's still your intention
to plead guilty.

1421
01:16:57.029 --> 01:16:59.781
Miss Waters.
is it your intention to plead guilty?

1422
01:17:02.743 --> 01:17:04.077
I wanna go to court.

1423
01:17:24.431 --> 01:17:26.099
I know you talked her into this.

1424
01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:28.644
When you lose this case.

1425
01:17:29.603 --> 01:17:33.231
I promise you.
you're fired. and your career's over.

1426
01:17:39.738 --> 01:17:41.990
Hope I don't lose my job.
but I ran him. and he's clean.

1427
01:17:42.074 --> 01:17:45.827
Damn it. He's a con artist.
He probably has several different aliases.

1428
01:17:45.911 --> 01:17:50.415
Well. okay. Uh. do you know any of them.
or do you have fingerprints or something?

1429
01:17:51.083 --> 01:17:52.584
Oh. my God. Um...

1430
01:17:53.335 --> 01:17:56.380
Try this. It's a long shot.
but see what happens.

1431
01:17:56.463 --> 01:17:59.508
Okay. Babe. I was kidding. but great.
Another thing to get me fired.

1432
01:17:59.925 --> 01:18:01.134
Thanks. babe. Okay.

1433
01:18:01.385 --> 01:18:03.470
Um... I'm gonna call Sarah to the stand.

1434
01:18:04.179 --> 01:18:05.722
I don't know. that could be tricky.

1435
01:18:05.806 --> 01:18:07.391
The DA doesn't know that she called her.

1436
01:18:07.474 --> 01:18:09.476
But if he's good.
he could potentially get it out of her.

1437
01:18:09.559 --> 01:18:11.770
No. no. no. No. She's strong.

1438
01:18:11.853 --> 01:18:13.271
- I don't know. Jasmine.
-She's strong.

1439
01:18:13.355 --> 01:18:14.773
That's. uh. really risky.

1440
01:18:14.856 --> 01:18:16.817
I need to establish
that she's a good person.

1441
01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:18.985
and what better person to do that
than her best friend?

1442
01:18:19.069 --> 01:18:20.195
-Right?
-Yeah.

1443
01:18:20.487 --> 01:18:23.323
-Yeah. that's true.
-I-I don't know. I don't know anymore.

1444
01:18:24.783 --> 01:18:28.453
Well. what else do we have
besides blood pooling and no body? Huh?

1445
01:18:30.497 --> 01:18:33.250
Okay. All we need is reasonable doubt.

1446
01:18:34.251 --> 01:18:35.377
Okay. let's just start again.

1447
01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:37.671
This is the third time we've started.
Look. there's nothing here.

1448
01:18:37.754 --> 01:18:38.880
Okay? There's no smoking gun.

1449
01:18:38.964 --> 01:18:41.758
Well. we need to find enough
circumstantial evidence to become one.

1450
01:18:45.971 --> 01:18:46.805
What?

1451
01:18:48.598 --> 01:18:50.392
Nothing. The fire.

1452
01:18:50.934 --> 01:18:51.893
We love it.

1453
01:18:52.477 --> 01:18:54.438
- I'll start again.
-I'm gonna take this file. Jasmine.

1454
01:18:54.521 --> 01:18:55.605
You get the phone records.

1455
01:19:02.696 --> 01:19:04.156
Opening statements.

1456
01:19:09.828 --> 01:19:11.496
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

1457
01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:16.126
Today. we are gonna prove.
without a reasonable doubt.

1458
01:19:16.918 --> 01:19:17.753
that this woman...

1459
01:19:19.296 --> 01:19:21.298
Grace Anne Waters.

1460
01:19:21.798 --> 01:19:26.219
murdered Shannon DeShawn Delong
in cold blood.

1461
01:19:27.637 --> 01:19:28.555
How'd she do it?

1462
01:19:30.348 --> 01:19:31.975
Well. she took a baseball bat.

1463
01:19:32.684 --> 01:19:33.560
like this one...

1464
01:19:34.728 --> 01:19:37.773
and she beat him to death.

1465
01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:42.444
Not only that. the evidence
is gonna show how she did it.

1466
01:19:42.736 --> 01:19:44.863
The motive will show why she did it.

1467
01:19:45.822 --> 01:19:46.865
And it's up to you

1468
01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:50.660
to show what happens to people
who break the law.

1469
01:19:51.244 --> 01:19:55.040
People like Grace Anne Waters
who are cold-blooded killers.

1470
01:19:56.041 --> 01:19:57.292
People with no regard...

1471
01:19:58.210 --> 01:19:59.419
for human life.

1472
01:20:00.754 --> 01:20:03.256
You have a chance. at this time.

1473
01:20:04.216 --> 01:20:07.177
to take Grace Anne Waters. a murderer...

1474
01:20:08.553 --> 01:20:10.806
off the streets forever.

1475
01:20:17.312 --> 01:20:18.355
Mrs. Bryant?

1476
01:20:24.986 --> 01:20:26.613
Mrs. Bryant.

1477
01:20:27.864 --> 01:20:29.616
Opening statements?

1478
01:20:43.213 --> 01:20:45.382
You've heard the prosecution assert

1479
01:20:46.216 --> 01:20:49.177
that there is evidence to prove
that she is guilty.

1480
01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:51.930
Well. we want you to know...

1481
01:20:52.889 --> 01:20:56.393
that that same evidence will prove

1482
01:20:56.476 --> 01:20:58.728
that she is not guilty.

1483
01:20:59.271 --> 01:21:02.649
Grace Waters is not a cold-blooded killer.

1484
01:21:02.732 --> 01:21:04.317
She's a grandmother.

1485
01:21:04.818 --> 01:21:07.028
She feeds the homeless.

1486
01:21:07.487 --> 01:21:09.531
She teaches Sunday school.

1487
01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:11.783
She bakes cookies.

1488
01:21:13.034 --> 01:21:14.160
Just look at her.

1489
01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:15.579
Look at her.

1490
01:21:16.246 --> 01:21:17.706
This is a nightmare for her.

1491
01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:22.460
and as it can be for anyone
who is on trial for murder

1492
01:21:22.544 --> 01:21:23.670
and is innocent.

1493
01:21:24.504 --> 01:21:26.506
Grace loved her husband.

1494
01:21:26.590 --> 01:21:29.593
and she did not cause his disappearance.

1495
01:21:29.676 --> 01:21:31.761
And the reason I say "disappearance"

1496
01:21:31.845 --> 01:21:34.806
is because the evidence will show
that there is. not now.

1497
01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:38.518
nor has there ever been.
any evidence that a murder happened.

1498
01:21:38.602 --> 01:21:40.979
No body found.

1499
01:21:41.855 --> 01:21:44.774
That's because she did not murder him.

1500
01:21:46.484 --> 01:21:48.278
Beyond reasonable doubt.

1501
01:21:49.696 --> 01:21:53.783
That's the conclusion you need to get past
in order to reach a verdict.

1502
01:21:55.243 --> 01:21:57.287
There are a lot of doubts here.

1503
01:21:58.955 --> 01:22:00.749
And they're all beyond reasonable.

1504
01:22:02.459 --> 01:22:03.293
You'll see.

1505
01:22:05.086 --> 01:22:06.004
You'll see.

1506
01:22:09.007 --> 01:22:10.175
Wow. that was good.

1507
01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:11.843
Mm. Don't doubt her.

1508
01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:14.679
It'll be a lot easier
when she stops doubting herself.

1509
01:22:15.055 --> 01:22:16.097
Call your first witness.

1510
01:22:16.181 --> 01:22:18.725
Prosecution calls
Detective Marshall Thomas.

1511
01:22:19.142 --> 01:22:21.102
Do you solemnly affirm
that you will tell the truth.

1512
01:22:21.186 --> 01:22:24.439
the whole truth. and nothing but the truth
under the pains and penalties of perjury?

1513
01:22:24.522 --> 01:22:26.316
-I do.
- Detective Thomas...

1514
01:22:27.192 --> 01:22:30.820
were you the officer that was called
to 1828 Bruben Lane?

1515
01:22:30.904 --> 01:22:31.738
Yes.

1516
01:22:31.821 --> 01:22:33.239
Did you find a body?

1517
01:22:33.323 --> 01:22:34.532
No. we didn't.

1518
01:22:34.616 --> 01:22:37.410
So you assumed that this was blood loss.

1519
01:22:37.911 --> 01:22:39.746
No assumption. we have DNA testing.

1520
01:22:39.829 --> 01:22:43.333
Well. can your DNA test determine
when that blood was left there?

1521
01:22:43.416 --> 01:22:45.210
No. the stains were cleaned up.

1522
01:22:45.293 --> 01:22:48.421
So it's a possibility that the blood
could have been left there over time?

1523
01:22:49.547 --> 01:22:51.007
I suppose. but that's not--

1524
01:22:51.091 --> 01:22:53.468
Like over several different times
to add up to that same amount?

1525
01:22:54.719 --> 01:22:55.720
That's highly unlikely.

1526
01:22:55.804 --> 01:22:56.972
I didn't ask if it was likely.

1527
01:22:57.055 --> 01:22:59.808
I asked was it reasonably possible that
that could happen?

1528
01:23:01.059 --> 01:23:03.395
Yes. Anything's possible.

1529
01:23:04.270 --> 01:23:05.689
No further questions.

1530
01:23:06.147 --> 01:23:07.440
The blood spatter.

1531
01:23:07.524 --> 01:23:10.735
Is that normal in this position
for blunt force trauma?

1532
01:23:11.444 --> 01:23:12.278
Yes.

1533
01:23:12.988 --> 01:23:15.365
See. so when I looked at this. I saw--

1534
01:23:15.448 --> 01:23:17.534
Objection. Your Honor.
Is there a question here?

1535
01:23:17.617 --> 01:23:18.827
Sustained.

1536
01:23:21.329 --> 01:23:23.164
So the trajectory of the blood

1537
01:23:23.248 --> 01:23:26.584
could have been from something hitting it
after it was already there?

1538
01:23:27.544 --> 01:23:28.420
Yes.

1539
01:23:29.254 --> 01:23:30.422
No further questions.

1540
01:23:32.257 --> 01:23:35.093
Do you remember where you were
the night of August the 17th?

1541
01:23:35.176 --> 01:23:37.387
Do you use illegal narcotics?

1542
01:23:37.637 --> 01:23:39.431
So you worked with Mr. Delong?

1543
01:23:39.931 --> 01:23:41.933
Did you find him to be
a responsible young man?

1544
01:23:42.017 --> 01:23:43.226
Have you slept with him. ma'am?

1545
01:23:43.309 --> 01:23:44.978
- Objection.
-Sustained.

1546
01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:48.231
When he asked to take your picture.
was he flirty?

1547
01:23:48.314 --> 01:23:50.942
- Did you let him?
-Objection. Your Honor. move to strike.

1548
01:23:51.026 --> 01:23:52.652
- On what grounds?
- Your Honor--

1549
01:23:52.736 --> 01:23:54.320
Don't make me warn you again.

1550
01:23:54.404 --> 01:23:56.406
Did you meet him there
in the store?

1551
01:23:57.032 --> 01:23:58.408
Did you know he was married?

1552
01:23:58.491 --> 01:24:00.910
How many men have you seen her
in church with?

1553
01:24:00.994 --> 01:24:02.829
Was she affectionate with these men?

1554
01:24:02.912 --> 01:24:03.913
Objection. Your Honor.

1555
01:24:03.997 --> 01:24:05.123
Overruled.

1556
01:24:06.332 --> 01:24:07.417
<i>How we doing?</i>

1557
01:24:07.834 --> 01:24:10.420
Well. the prosecutor
is blowing us out the water.

1558
01:24:11.629 --> 01:24:13.465
Now. you know I did not call your son.

1559
01:24:14.215 --> 01:24:15.050
Thank you.

1560
01:24:15.216 --> 01:24:17.719
But Sarah I can call to the stand.

1561
01:24:18.428 --> 01:24:22.390
and. um. I can raise reasonable doubt
by simply asking if she killed Shannon.

1562
01:24:22.474 --> 01:24:23.475
-Listen--
- No.

1563
01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:26.770
Now. you don't listen. do you?
That is my friend.

1564
01:24:27.645 --> 01:24:30.148
Grace. I really feel like
we have an in there

1565
01:24:30.231 --> 01:24:31.483
-if we can just--
- Jasmine.

1566
01:24:31.566 --> 01:24:35.737
Do it. and I promise you. I will stand up
and scream I did it. that I'm guilty.

1567
01:24:36.112 --> 01:24:38.865
Okay.

1568
01:24:40.283 --> 01:24:41.117
All right.

1569
01:24:54.130 --> 01:24:57.550
Wow. the prosecution has
some unbelievably strong witnesses.

1570
01:24:57.634 --> 01:24:59.469
-I know.
-So what are you gonna do?

1571
01:24:59.552 --> 01:25:01.179
I have to call Sarah to the stand.

1572
01:25:01.262 --> 01:25:04.182
Mmm. Jasmine. if you don't go after her
and give the jury something--

1573
01:25:04.265 --> 01:25:05.391
Don't you think I know that?

1574
01:25:05.475 --> 01:25:07.519
Okay. but you need her to be
more than just a character witness.

1575
01:25:07.602 --> 01:25:09.646
I know that. too.
And I can't go left on her.

1576
01:25:09.729 --> 01:25:10.688
or Grace'll lose it.

1577
01:25:10.772 --> 01:25:13.650
And I can't ask her about Shannon
and Grace's relationship.

1578
01:25:13.733 --> 01:25:16.736
because that'll give the prosecution
another motive. I got it. Donnie.

1579
01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:17.654
Okay?

1580
01:25:17.904 --> 01:25:18.738
Okay.

1581
01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:20.657
You know I'm just trying to help. right?

1582
01:25:21.241 --> 01:25:22.325
-Thanks.
- Yes. ma'am.

1583
01:25:26.454 --> 01:25:27.664
Babe. sleep.

1584
01:25:28.498 --> 01:25:29.541
I can't.

1585
01:25:30.333 --> 01:25:31.417
It's gonna be fine.

1586
01:25:31.835 --> 01:25:32.669
It will.

1587
01:25:33.086 --> 01:25:35.296
I just hope Sarah doesn't blow it.

1588
01:25:36.422 --> 01:25:38.800
Well. you. Donnie.
and Tilsa prepped her. right?

1589
01:25:39.217 --> 01:25:40.051
Yeah. but...

1590
01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:44.472
-she's all I have.
- Mm.

1591
01:25:45.598 --> 01:25:48.184
Stop stressing.
I'm gonna be off early tomorrow.

1592
01:25:48.268 --> 01:25:51.229
I'm gonna get there as soon as I can.
I'm gonna watch you knock it out. okay?

1593
01:25:53.022 --> 01:25:53.898
Now. go to sleep.

1594
01:25:57.193 --> 01:25:58.278
<i>Miss Miller.</i>

1595
01:25:58.736 --> 01:26:02.323
can you tell the court
about your relationship with Grace?

1596
01:26:05.535 --> 01:26:06.703
We're best friends.

1597
01:26:08.413 --> 01:26:10.331
And how close are you two?

1598
01:26:11.374 --> 01:26:14.377
She's like the sister I never had.

1599
01:26:16.921 --> 01:26:19.841
And how long
have you known each other. Miss Miller?

1600
01:26:20.675 --> 01:26:21.676
For six years.

1601
01:26:22.886 --> 01:26:25.096
And in that time of knowing her.
Miss Miller.

1602
01:26:25.638 --> 01:26:29.767
have you ever seen Grace violent or angry?

1603
01:26:30.393 --> 01:26:32.729
Oh. no. Oh. no.

1604
01:26:33.271 --> 01:26:36.774
She's not a violent person.
even when she should be.

1605
01:26:36.858 --> 01:26:38.234
What do you mean by that?

1606
01:26:39.277 --> 01:26:42.655
I have seen people be very mean to Grace.

1607
01:26:42.739 --> 01:26:44.574
and she just prayed for them.

1608
01:26:45.283 --> 01:26:48.536
Now. the prosecution wants us to believe.
Miss Miller.

1609
01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:52.081
that Grace is a cold-blooded murderer.

1610
01:26:52.165 --> 01:26:54.167
- Objection.
- Sustained.

1611
01:26:54.626 --> 01:26:56.794
I'm not gonna warn you again.
Mrs. Bryant.

1612
01:26:56.878 --> 01:26:58.421
Ask a question.

1613
01:27:02.175 --> 01:27:03.218
Miss Miller.

1614
01:27:03.551 --> 01:27:05.178
is Grace capable

1615
01:27:05.261 --> 01:27:08.014
of murdering someone?

1616
01:27:10.308 --> 01:27:13.144
G-Grace? Oh. no. No. no.

1617
01:27:13.686 --> 01:27:15.980
She would never hurt anyone. She wouldn't.

1618
01:27:16.397 --> 01:27:19.525
Is she capable of beating someone
with a bat?

1619
01:27:21.069 --> 01:27:22.487
Absolutely not.

1620
01:27:24.197 --> 01:27:25.406
No further questions.

1621
01:27:25.907 --> 01:27:28.534
- Thank you. Miss Miller.

1622
01:27:33.248 --> 01:27:34.207
Miss Miller.

1623
01:27:34.290 --> 01:27:36.834
you say the two of you were close friends?

1624
01:27:37.627 --> 01:27:38.503
Yes.

1625
01:27:38.586 --> 01:27:41.130
So would she call you
when she was in trouble?

1626
01:27:41.214 --> 01:27:42.048
No.

1627
01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:45.051
- She wouldn't?
-I mean. yes.

1628
01:27:45.134 --> 01:27:46.427
Yes. she would.

1629
01:27:46.928 --> 01:27:48.304
Well. did she call you
on the...

1630
01:27:48.388 --> 01:27:50.348
the night in question. August 17th?

1631
01:27:52.058 --> 01:27:53.017
Uh...

1632
01:27:55.603 --> 01:27:58.147
-I know you want to protect your friend.
-Objection. Your Honor.

1633
01:27:58.231 --> 01:27:59.565
Sustained.

1634
01:28:00.525 --> 01:28:02.860
Miss Miller.
you are under oath to tell the truth.

1635
01:28:02.944 --> 01:28:06.030
Did she call you the night of August 17th?

1636
01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:11.494
Uh...  Yes.

1637
01:28:11.953 --> 01:28:13.705
What did you talk about?

1638
01:28:14.455 --> 01:28:16.332
How we were gonna feed the homeless.

1639
01:28:16.874 --> 01:28:18.710
What exactly did she say?

1640
01:28:18.918 --> 01:28:21.504
Just that she was excited about it. and...

1641
01:28:22.005 --> 01:28:25.341
we talked about her son. Malcolm.
for a while.

1642
01:28:26.092 --> 01:28:26.968
Hmm.

1643
01:28:27.051 --> 01:28:28.678
How long did you speak?

1644
01:28:30.013 --> 01:28:31.306
About 15 minutes.

1645
01:28:33.308 --> 01:28:34.434
Okay. Well...

1646
01:28:35.518 --> 01:28:38.146
the. uh. phone record shows that

1647
01:28:38.730 --> 01:28:42.150
the two of you talked
for less than two minutes.

1648
01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:43.443
Is that about right?

1649
01:28:43.526 --> 01:28:44.360
Objection!

1650
01:28:45.737 --> 01:28:46.904
On what grounds?

1651
01:28:46.988 --> 01:28:49.615
This particular phone record
was not in discovery.

1652
01:28:50.199 --> 01:28:51.034
Approach.

1653
01:28:56.914 --> 01:28:59.584
Your Honor. the defense was not given
this phone record.

1654
01:28:59.667 --> 01:29:01.669
Your Honor.
if you look at the list of documents.

1655
01:29:01.753 --> 01:29:03.004
it's on discovery.

1656
01:29:03.087 --> 01:29:05.256
But. Your Honor. we did not get this
in discovery.

1657
01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:08.051
this particular phone record.
nor have we had the time to.

1658
01:29:08.134 --> 01:29:11.929
It says here that they were given
months ago.

1659
01:29:13.890 --> 01:29:16.392
Well. I was just given this case
three weeks ago. and there was--

1660
01:29:16.476 --> 01:29:19.479
Your Honor. we can't be held responsible
for Miss Bryant's incompetence here.

1661
01:29:19.562 --> 01:29:20.396
She had them.

1662
01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:21.939
You may continue.

1663
01:29:22.023 --> 01:29:23.274
Thank you. Your Honor.

1664
01:29:24.984 --> 01:29:26.152
But. Your Honor. if we can--

1665
01:29:26.235 --> 01:29:28.905
Welcome to trial. Mrs. Bryant.

1666
01:29:29.364 --> 01:29:30.615
Now. step away.

1667
01:29:45.129 --> 01:29:45.963
Okay.

1668
01:29:47.799 --> 01:29:48.883
Where was I?

1669
01:29:50.343 --> 01:29:51.344
Phone records.

1670
01:29:52.595 --> 01:29:53.679
Now. they show...

1671
01:29:54.263 --> 01:29:57.058
that you spoke for less than two minutes.
right?

1672
01:29:58.184 --> 01:30:00.436
I-I really don't remember.

1673
01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:01.854
It's been so long ago.

1674
01:30:01.938 --> 01:30:04.399
Well. maybe you remember
what you did after the call.

1675
01:30:04.482 --> 01:30:05.525
What did you do?

1676
01:30:06.025 --> 01:30:08.861
Well. it was late. so I went to bed.

1677
01:30:09.529 --> 01:30:12.490
Well. then why was your cell phone used

1678
01:30:13.116 --> 01:30:14.867
and pinged to a cell tower

1679
01:30:14.951 --> 01:30:16.911
near Grace's home a few moments later?

1680
01:30:18.037 --> 01:30:20.331
I-I... I don't recall.

1681
01:30:20.415 --> 01:30:22.667
Her phone records show
an incoming call from you.

1682
01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:24.168
Did you call her?

1683
01:30:25.253 --> 01:30:27.588
Miss Miller. you made it very clear
earlier in your testimony

1684
01:30:27.672 --> 01:30:28.923
that you two are friends.

1685
01:30:29.549 --> 01:30:31.175
I understand. you care for her deeply.

1686
01:30:31.759 --> 01:30:34.262
-Are you covering for her now?
-No.

1687
01:30:34.345 --> 01:30:36.431
Then can you please clear up
these phone records?

1688
01:30:36.514 --> 01:30:38.891
She lives in Rotwell County.
It's very rural.

1689
01:30:38.975 --> 01:30:42.228
She called you once. you called her twice.
Why?

1690
01:30:42.311 --> 01:30:44.564
-I don't remember.
- It's on the phone records.

1691
01:30:44.647 --> 01:30:46.899
She called you. you spoke
for less than two minutes.

1692
01:30:46.983 --> 01:30:49.652
Then you went to her house.
you called her.

1693
01:30:49.735 --> 01:30:50.987
then you were at your house.

1694
01:30:51.070 --> 01:30:53.406
You called her again 45 minutes later.
Why?

1695
01:30:53.906 --> 01:30:54.907
I don't remember.

1696
01:30:54.991 --> 01:30:58.744
Miss Miller. do you understand
that you can be put in jail for perjury?

1697
01:30:58.828 --> 01:31:00.621
You do know what perjury is. right?

1698
01:31:06.586 --> 01:31:07.503
Your Honor...

1699
01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:12.341
The witness will answer.

1700
01:31:14.677 --> 01:31:17.680
She told me that she killed him.

1701
01:31:21.184 --> 01:31:22.852
I'm sorry. Grace.

1702
01:31:27.064 --> 01:31:28.232
No further questions.

1703
01:31:32.862 --> 01:31:34.489
Mrs. Bryant. your witness.

1704
01:31:36.532 --> 01:31:38.075
No further questions. Your Honor.

1705
01:31:38.159 --> 01:31:39.118
Okay.

1706
01:31:39.952 --> 01:31:40.912
You may step down.

1707
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:47.877
Is the defense resting. Mrs. Bryant?

1708
01:31:48.544 --> 01:31:49.795
The defense rests.

1709
01:31:50.671 --> 01:31:52.965
Closing arguments in the morning
at 9:00 a.m.

1710
01:31:53.049 --> 01:31:54.133
-We're adjourned.

1711
01:31:54.217 --> 01:31:55.551
All rise.

1712
01:32:01.724 --> 01:32:03.351
-You tried.

1713
01:32:22.245 --> 01:32:24.080
How could you miss the phone records?

1714
01:32:25.998 --> 01:32:26.958
I. um...

1715
01:32:27.959 --> 01:32:29.335
I didn't see them. sir.

1716
01:32:29.418 --> 01:32:30.253
I. um...

1717
01:32:31.587 --> 01:32:33.798
I thought I saw them.
but I didn't-- I didn't see them.

1718
01:32:33.881 --> 01:32:36.008
and I was just completely overwhelmed.

1719
01:32:36.092 --> 01:32:37.009
-I--
-Overwhelmed.

1720
01:32:37.093 --> 01:32:38.803
You didn't see 'em? I saw 'em.

1721
01:32:38.886 --> 01:32:41.514
'Cause I was shadowing you.
I was watching it all along.

1722
01:32:42.098 --> 01:32:47.770
I don't get it. I...
...I just sit in that office for 25 years.

1723
01:32:47.853 --> 01:32:49.438
watching people like you come in.

1724
01:32:49.522 --> 01:32:52.149
then go out to private practice.
go to other firms. make more money.

1725
01:32:52.233 --> 01:32:55.236
but I respect it.
I'm insulted by your callous demeanor.

1726
01:32:56.153 --> 01:32:57.363
You know what you just did?

1727
01:32:57.446 --> 01:32:59.949
This is 101.
You let a witness leave the stand

1728
01:33:00.032 --> 01:33:01.617
saying that your client was a murderer.

1729
01:33:03.119 --> 01:33:04.161
That's what you did.

1730
01:33:04.829 --> 01:33:07.039
That's what they're gonna think about
all night long.

1731
01:33:10.126 --> 01:33:11.043
I don't get it.

1732
01:33:13.921 --> 01:33:16.924
I guess it's a millennial thing.
I'll never understand it.

1733
01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:46.329
Baby. come on. just eat a little bit.

1734
01:33:48.372 --> 01:33:49.415
Please. come on.

1735
01:33:49.498 --> 01:33:52.668
I don't want it!
Who are you. my father? I don't want it!

1736
01:34:03.054 --> 01:34:03.971
I'm sorry.

1737
01:34:05.514 --> 01:34:06.349
Okay?

1738
01:34:08.392 --> 01:34:11.354
I'm just really stressed right now.

1739
01:34:11.937 --> 01:34:13.397
and I know you're upset.

1740
01:34:13.981 --> 01:34:16.067
but you heard the way he talked to me.

1741
01:34:16.651 --> 01:34:19.111
-Why didn't you say something?
-'Cause he made a lot of good points.

1742
01:34:19.945 --> 01:34:21.030
I don't like the way he said it.

1743
01:34:21.113 --> 01:34:23.783
but he was telling you the truth. Jasmine.
The truth hurts sometimes.

1744
01:34:25.409 --> 01:34:26.243
Wow.

1745
01:34:27.536 --> 01:34:30.623
-I can't believe you're taking his side.
-I'm not on his side. baby.

1746
01:34:30.706 --> 01:34:32.124
I'm on your side. I'm on our side.

1747
01:34:32.208 --> 01:34:33.834
I'm on whatever's going
to make you better.

1748
01:34:34.293 --> 01:34:35.127
Truth is hard to get.

1749
01:34:35.211 --> 01:34:36.962
but it can make you strong
if you just let it.

1750
01:34:37.046 --> 01:34:39.048
-You are such an ass.
- I'm not the ass.

1751
01:34:39.131 --> 01:34:40.508
-You are such an ass!
-I'm not the ass.

1752
01:34:40.591 --> 01:34:42.760
-I don't walk away when things get hard.
-Are you serious?

1753
01:34:42.843 --> 01:34:44.929
-Yeah. I'm dead serious.
-Really?

1754
01:34:45.012 --> 01:34:47.473
You can't keep running away
your whole life

1755
01:34:47.556 --> 01:34:48.933
hiding behind plea deals. Jasmine.

1756
01:34:49.016 --> 01:34:52.353
I was trying! That's the reason
why I'm trying this case.

1757
01:34:52.436 --> 01:34:54.355
Okay. so somebody says something
that sets you back.

1758
01:34:54.438 --> 01:34:55.606
and you just walk away. babe.

1759
01:34:55.690 --> 01:34:57.149
-The case is lost!
-No. it's not.

1760
01:34:57.233 --> 01:34:58.359
You saw the jury!

1761
01:34:58.442 --> 01:35:01.237
-What am I supposed to do?
-You're supposed to do your job. babe!

1762
01:35:02.029 --> 01:35:03.030
Till the end!

1763
01:35:03.114 --> 01:35:05.700
I'm serious. the job you were born to do.
That's...

1764
01:35:05.783 --> 01:35:06.617
Baby.

1765
01:35:07.243 --> 01:35:10.329
I saw the fire in your eyes
when you started this case.

1766
01:35:10.413 --> 01:35:12.623
and I saw it just go away
as soon as this moment happened.

1767
01:35:12.707 --> 01:35:13.916
Just find it again.

1768
01:35:16.085 --> 01:35:17.128
It's done.

1769
01:35:17.628 --> 01:35:19.088
The case is closed.

1770
01:35:19.171 --> 01:35:21.173
All that's left is the closing argument.

1771
01:35:21.549 --> 01:35:22.800
There's nothing I can do.

1772
01:35:22.883 --> 01:35:25.261
Well. you better write
one hell of a closing argument.

1773
01:35:25.344 --> 01:35:26.220
Hmm?

1774
01:35:30.474 --> 01:35:31.934
I'm tired.

1775
01:35:32.601 --> 01:35:33.436
Babe.

1776
01:35:39.650 --> 01:35:42.445
You've heard the testimony
of over 45 witnesses

1777
01:35:42.528 --> 01:35:44.363
that have attested to her guilt.

1778
01:35:44.864 --> 01:35:47.867
Her own best friend said
she told her that she killed him.

1779
01:35:48.534 --> 01:35:50.202
She knew her better than anyone.

1780
01:35:50.286 --> 01:35:53.247
Miss Waters killed Shannon Delong.

1781
01:35:53.330 --> 01:35:56.500
and she dragged his body
out to a swamp in the country.

1782
01:35:56.917 --> 01:35:58.169
never to be found again.

1783
01:35:59.086 --> 01:36:00.171
That's cold-blooded.

1784
01:36:00.838 --> 01:36:02.131
That is calculated.

1785
01:36:02.214 --> 01:36:04.550
That is premeditated murder.

1786
01:36:05.509 --> 01:36:07.636
And it's your job to bring her to justice.

1787
01:36:07.845 --> 01:36:08.929
It is your job

1788
01:36:09.013 --> 01:36:12.016
to find her guilty.
and we have the utmost faith in you.

1789
01:36:12.099 --> 01:36:14.018
and our legal system. that you will.

1790
01:36:15.227 --> 01:36:16.103
Thank you.

1791
01:36:20.065 --> 01:36:21.108
Mrs. Bryant?

1792
01:36:24.278 --> 01:36:25.738
Mrs. Bryant.

1793
01:36:27.323 --> 01:36:28.324
Are you okay?

1794
01:36:31.702 --> 01:36:33.454
The defense calls Sarah Miller.

1795
01:36:33.954 --> 01:36:36.290
Your Honor. both sides rested yesterday.

1796
01:36:36.373 --> 01:36:37.917
Approach the bench.

1797
01:36:44.381 --> 01:36:45.966
Your Honor. both sides rested.

1798
01:36:46.050 --> 01:36:48.844
I understand the counsel is a novice here.
This is ridiculous.

1799
01:36:48.928 --> 01:36:51.555
Hold on. Counsel. Mrs. Bryant.

1800
01:36:51.639 --> 01:36:55.226
you do understand
that both sides have rested?

1801
01:36:55.309 --> 01:36:56.435
Yes. I do. Your Honor.

1802
01:36:56.519 --> 01:36:59.563
but I would like to recall Miss Miller
to the stand.

1803
01:36:59.647 --> 01:37:01.982
On what grounds?

1804
01:37:02.650 --> 01:37:05.945
I should have questioned her
after she said what she said.

1805
01:37:06.237 --> 01:37:08.155
and I should not have rested.

1806
01:37:08.239 --> 01:37:10.282
and I would like to question her again
because--

1807
01:37:10.366 --> 01:37:13.327
That's not how this works.

1808
01:37:13.410 --> 01:37:17.373
Once you rest. you cannot call a witness.

1809
01:37:17.456 --> 01:37:19.041
Just take it up in appeal.

1810
01:37:19.333 --> 01:37:21.001
Closing arguments right now.

1811
01:37:21.085 --> 01:37:23.087
-But. Your Honor. if I could just--
- Ah!

1812
01:37:23.754 --> 01:37:25.714
Step back and argue.

1813
01:37:27.466 --> 01:37:29.176
Now. Counselor.

1814
01:37:40.396 --> 01:37:42.648
-The defense calls Sarah Miller.
-Your Honor...

1815
01:37:42.731 --> 01:37:45.276
Mrs. Bryant. I have already ruled on that.

1816
01:37:45.359 --> 01:37:46.902
and I will not tolerate any more--

1817
01:37:46.986 --> 01:37:48.153
Take the stand. Miss Miller.

1818
01:37:48.612 --> 01:37:50.781
-Take the stand.
- Mrs. Bryant!

1819
01:37:51.532 --> 01:37:53.200
Miss Miller. sit back down.

1820
01:37:53.284 --> 01:37:54.952
You are not taking the stand.

1821
01:37:55.035 --> 01:37:57.413
Counselors. in my chambers now.

1822
01:37:57.496 --> 01:37:59.248
I will not be going
to Your Honor's chambers

1823
01:37:59.331 --> 01:38:02.126
-until Miss Miller takes the stand.
-I have ruled on the matter.

1824
01:38:02.209 --> 01:38:04.753
and you will come to my chambers.

1825
01:38:04.837 --> 01:38:08.382
I'm not going into Your Honor's chambers
until Miss Miller takes the stand.

1826
01:38:08.799 --> 01:38:11.343
-Miss Miller. take the stand. please.
- Mrs. Bryant.

1827
01:38:11.427 --> 01:38:14.805
if you do not come into my chambers
right now.

1828
01:38:15.639 --> 01:38:19.268
I will hold you in contempt.

1829
01:38:21.395 --> 01:38:23.689
The defense calls Sarah Miller
to the stand.

1830
01:38:23.772 --> 01:38:25.983
Bailiff.

1831
01:38:29.153 --> 01:38:30.905
-Can you believe this?

1832
01:38:37.453 --> 01:38:39.079
So what the hell was that?

1833
01:38:39.163 --> 01:38:40.456
The hell do you care?

1834
01:38:40.539 --> 01:38:41.832
I'm fired anyway.

1835
01:38:43.417 --> 01:38:46.754
Yeah. that's true.
So you throw your life away anyway?

1836
01:38:49.048 --> 01:38:50.382
That's what you wanted. isn't it?

1837
01:38:52.009 --> 01:38:53.010
What I wanted?

1838
01:38:53.093 --> 01:38:54.136
Mm-hmm.

1839
01:38:54.219 --> 01:38:56.555
-No.
-And if that's what it takes.

1840
01:38:57.181 --> 01:38:58.641
She shouldn't go to jail.

1841
01:38:59.016 --> 01:38:59.975
This is unfair.

1842
01:39:00.059 --> 01:39:02.311
Unfair. unfair. That's the word.

1843
01:39:03.729 --> 01:39:04.813
Now you get it.

1844
01:39:04.897 --> 01:39:07.816
All of this is unfair.
The law can be unfair. but it was your job

1845
01:39:07.900 --> 01:39:10.277
to walk into that courtroom
and make it fair.

1846
01:39:10.361 --> 01:39:12.529
- But instead. what'd you do?

1847
01:39:12.613 --> 01:39:14.990
Go to court half-assed
after you convinced this woman

1848
01:39:15.074 --> 01:39:16.825
to not take a great plea deal?

1849
01:39:17.451 --> 01:39:19.995
Now look. it's all unfair.

1850
01:39:20.079 --> 01:39:22.748
Listen. I love this personal conviction
that you got going on right now.

1851
01:39:22.831 --> 01:39:24.208
but it's on the wrong side of time.

1852
01:39:24.291 --> 01:39:27.753
The judge is gonna make you sit here
until you apologize.

1853
01:39:27.836 --> 01:39:28.879
You think that's something.

1854
01:39:28.963 --> 01:39:32.007
he gave us a recess so that
<i>we</i> can do your closing arguments.

1855
01:39:32.091 --> 01:39:33.425
Donnie is thrilled.

1856
01:39:33.509 --> 01:39:36.220
You weren't gonna get a mistrial.
What the hell were you thinking?

1857
01:39:38.305 --> 01:39:39.473
Enjoy your time here.

1858
01:39:40.599 --> 01:39:41.475
Hey. Rory.

1859
01:39:43.018 --> 01:39:43.852
Yeah?

1860
01:39:44.937 --> 01:39:45.980
Fuck you.

1861
01:39:50.442 --> 01:39:52.236
Passion behind bars.

1862
01:39:53.153 --> 01:39:53.988
Nice.

1863
01:39:58.617 --> 01:39:59.952
We. the jury.

1864
01:40:00.035 --> 01:40:02.621
find Grace Waters. the defendant.

1865
01:40:02.705 --> 01:40:06.500
guilty of murder as charged
by the state of Virginia.

1866
01:40:20.597 --> 01:40:21.890
I'm all right. baby.

1867
01:40:23.684 --> 01:40:24.685
I'm all right.

1868
01:40:25.644 --> 01:40:27.896
-It's okay. I got him.
- Sarah.

1869
01:40:28.272 --> 01:40:30.399
- It's okay. I got him.
-Thank you.

1870
01:40:32.026 --> 01:40:33.110
It's all right.

1871
01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:36.405
Is that an Uzo?

1872
01:40:36.488 --> 01:40:38.949
Got this in Africa. One of a kind.

1873
01:40:42.286 --> 01:40:44.038
I got him. It's okay.

1874
01:40:50.002 --> 01:40:52.796
<i> You will not believe</i>
<i>what your photographer did.</i>

1875
01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:54.715
Do you need me to drive you?

1876
01:40:55.174 --> 01:40:56.884
<i> 'Cause you are going.</i>

1877
01:41:00.596 --> 01:41:02.139
Guard!

1878
01:41:02.222 --> 01:41:04.558
You want to talk to me like that
in front of your friend?

1879
01:41:05.059 --> 01:41:06.393
<i>Her </i>friend.

1880
01:41:08.854 --> 01:41:09.938
Guard!

1881
01:41:10.773 --> 01:41:12.524
I need to call my lawyer.

1882
01:41:12.608 --> 01:41:15.277
<i> The verdict</i>
<i>in the Grace Waters case is guilty.</i>

1883
01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:17.654
<i>Sentencing is scheduled</i>
<i>in just a few months.</i>

1884
01:41:18.197 --> 01:41:21.950
<i>This turn of events is no shock to anybody</i>
<i>who was in the courtroom today</i>

1885
01:41:22.034 --> 01:41:22.868
<i>or the jurors.</i>

1886
01:41:22.951 --> 01:41:24.536
<i>This was what was expected.</i>

1887
01:41:24.620 --> 01:41:28.082
<i>Grace was expected to be convicted.</i>
<i>and nothing changed here today.</i>

1888
01:41:35.089 --> 01:41:37.633
<i>...predict that some sort</i>
<i>of plea deal is in the works.</i>

1889

Just come on in.

1940
01:44:01.902 --> 01:44:04.196
You're at Miss Sarah's house.
This is where you live.

01:44:04.279 --> 01:44:06.823
-This is your house. it's okay.
-No. no. No.

1942

2989 Sycamore Street.

1951
01:44:38.230 --> 01:44:39.773
I don't wanna die here like...

1953
01:44:46.113 --> 01:44:48.448

Jumped off the roof. dear.

1955
01:44:50.534 --> 01:44:53.120

1964
01:45:22.190 --> 01:45:23.734
Somebody got into my accounts.

I had to build my own boat first.

Ain't that a fact?

1970
01:45:41.543 --> 01:45:44.254
I mean. I can't help everybody.

1971
01:45:50.677 --> 01:45:52.220
They're hungry.

I think he's done. He's done.

2029
01:52:03.425 --> 01:52:05.135
<i>What we've learned is that</i>
<i>Shannon Delong.</i>

2030
01:52:05.218 --> 01:52:06.594
<i>whose real name is Maurice Mills.</i>

2031
01:52:06.678 --> 01:52:09.639
and his mother. Betty Mills.
also known as Sarah Miller.

2032
01:52:09.723 --> 01:52:11.266
have been kidnapping elderly women.

2033
01:52:11.349 --> 01:52:14.644
taking their wealth and holding them
hostage for their social security.

2034
01:52:14.728 --> 01:52:16.730
Now he's wanted in nine states for bigamy

2035
01:52:16.813 --> 01:52:19.107
and several other crimes.
including racketeering.

2036
01:52:19.190 --> 01:52:20.191
And we've also discovered

2037
01:52:20.275 --> 01:52:23.361
that not only were these two
holding the elderly women hostage.

2038
01:52:23.445 --> 01:52:27.407
but he's wanted in several states
for conning at least 16 middle-aged women

2039
01:52:27.490 --> 01:52:28.491
that we can verify.

2040
01:52:28.575 --> 01:52:31.786
Now. the mother-and-son duo
have been at this for over 25 years.

2041
01:52:31.870 --> 01:52:34.622
stealing millions from their victims
over this time period.

2042
01:52:34.706 --> 01:52:36.916
<i>Grace Waters was one of the victims.</i>

2043
01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.043
In light of the new evidence
we received.

2044
01:52:39.127 --> 01:52:42.964
the state of Virginia wishes to apologize
to Miss Waters.

2045
01:52:43.047 --> 01:52:44.883
and you are free to go.

2046
01:53:07.322 --> 01:53:09.365
<i>We are working on finding out</i>
<i>what happened</i>

2047
01:53:09.449 --> 01:53:11.326
to the fortunes of these women.

2048
01:53:11.409 --> 01:53:13.077
Grace Waters' public defender.

2049
01:53:13.161 --> 01:53:16.539
Jasmine Bryant. is the reason
this entire scheme was uncovered.

2050
01:53:17.749 --> 01:53:19.751
- Miss Waters--
-Here they come. Here they come.

2051
01:53:22.337 --> 01:53:23.797
- Okay.
- Miss Waters.

2052
01:53:25.381 --> 01:53:27.634
Miss Waters. how does it feel to be free?

2053
01:53:28.051 --> 01:53:28.885
Wonderful.

2054
01:53:30.053 --> 01:53:32.096
Miss Waters. are you glad it's over?

2055
01:53:33.973 --> 01:53:35.058
It ain't over.

2056
01:53:36.893 --> 01:53:37.811
Excuse me.

2057
01:53:39.854 --> 01:53:44.067
At present. Sarah Miller.
rather. Betty Mills. is still on the run.

2058
01:53:45.443 --> 01:53:48.363
<i> So what kind of experience</i>
<i>do you have working with the elderly?</i>

2059
01:53:48.446 --> 01:53:49.781
<i> I take care of them.</i>

2060
01:53:50.532 --> 01:53:51.449
And I love them

2061
01:53:52.116 --> 01:53:53.868
just like they're my own family.

2062
01:53:54.828 --> 01:53:56.621
Well. come. I want you to meet my mother.

2063
01:53:56.704 --> 01:53:58.164
I'd like that.

2064
01:53:58.248 --> 01:53:59.415
What's her name again?

2065
01:53:59.499 --> 01:54:01.501
-LuAnn.
- LuAnn.

2066
01:54:01.584 --> 01:54:03.837
Oh. I think I read about her.

2067
01:54:04.128 --> 01:54:06.297
Didn't she work
with some financial institution?

2068
01:54:06.798 --> 01:54:09.050
-Oh. yeah. she did.
- Hmm.

2069
01:54:09.133 --> 01:54:10.635
What was her position again?

2070
01:54:10.718 --> 01:54:13.429
-She was a manager for ten years.
-Oh. my.

2071
01:54:13.513 --> 01:54:15.014
Impressive.
