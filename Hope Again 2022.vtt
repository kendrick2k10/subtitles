3
00:04:38.903 --> 00:04:41.614
- Girls. don't forget to unload the van.

4
00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:42.448
- Okay. mom.

5
00:04:54.502 --> 00:04:55.670
- Cheer up girls.

6
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.006
It's not like it's the
first time we've moved.

7
00:04:58.006 --> 00:04:59.966
- Probably not the last time either.

8
00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.926
- It's okay with me.

9
00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:03.553
I make friends wherever I go.

10
00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:43.968
- Hey Ralph. you wanted to see me?

11
00:05:43.968 --> 00:05:46.262
- Yes. yes. come on in Darla.

12
00:05:54.562 --> 00:05:55.897
Just make yourself at home.

13
00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:57.940
- How are you doing?

14
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.029
- It's been pretty rough.

15
00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:04.947
It's not easy going through a divorce.

16
00:06:04.947 --> 00:06:06.657
- Can you tell us about the divorce?

17
00:06:06.657 --> 00:06:07.909
- Ralph?
- Well?

18
00:06:09.118 --> 00:06:12.914
- If you feel comfortable
telling us what's been going on.

19
00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:14.040
maybe we can help.

20
00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:18.419
- It's a very long story.

21
00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:22.465
but the short version of it

22
00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:26.219
is that my husband decided
after 19 years of marriage.

23
00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:27.929
that he didn't wanna be married anymore.

24
00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:31.682
And he's also told me that he
wants to explore other options

25
00:06:31.682 --> 00:06:33.434
and other life possibilities.

26
00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:39.107
- Well. was there any
infidelity during your marriage?

27
00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:40.358
- Not that I know of. no.

28
00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:43.319
- Oh. sorry to hear that.

29
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.322
So how are you responding?

30
00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:47.448
How are you taking it?

31
00:06:48.991 --> 00:06:51.369
- I'm trying to let go somehow.

32
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.831
- You're not fighting for it?

33
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:56.999
You're not fighting for your marriage?

34
00:06:56.999 --> 00:06:59.335
- I'm not going to force myself on him.

35
00:06:59.335 --> 00:07:01.254
and I'm not gonna stay
in a loveless marriage.

36
00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:03.881
and I'm not gonna make my
young vulnerable daughters

37
00:07:05.299 --> 00:07:08.386
be around someone who
clearly does not love them

38
00:07:08.386 --> 00:07:09.262
or their mother.

39
00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:12.140
- No. we understand that.

40
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.476
It's just that-
- What?

41
00:07:15.476 --> 00:07:16.894
- Well. here at our church.

42
00:07:16.894 --> 00:07:21.899
we believe that the only
biblical reason for a divorce is.

43
00:07:23.776 --> 00:07:26.279
well it's marital unfaithfulness.

44
00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:29.991
Well. since there was no infidelity.

45
00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:33.369
Yeah. I know you mentioned
that he said he wanted

46
00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:34.829
to pursue other avenues.

47
00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:38.249
but since there wasn't any actual cheating

48
00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:41.377
and you're just willing to
go with it and not fight

49
00:07:41.377 --> 00:07:43.463
for your marriage...

50
00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:45.465
- What are you saying?

51
00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:48.718
Are you trying to say that
it's my fault even partially?

52
00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:52.805
My young girls need to know
that they are valued and loved.

53
00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:56.350
And if he's not willing to do it.

54
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.269
then he can be on his way.

55
00:07:58.269 --> 00:07:59.687
The Bible also says that.

56
00:07:59.687 --> 00:08:02.523
"If the wicked choose to
depart. let them depart."

57
00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:05.234
- It just looks bad.

58
00:08:08.696 --> 00:08:11.949
You know very well the blow

59
00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:15.453
that the leadership team
here has had this past year

60
00:08:15.453 --> 00:08:20.458
with the youth pastor
scandal. he deceived us all.

61
00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:23.377
and now a young girl's life
will never be the same.

62
00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:28.508
We just have to make sure
that the congregation

63
00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:30.510
and the membership know

64
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.679
that we're not willing to just
throw anyone into leadership.

65
00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:36.807
that we're not going to
hire child predators.

66
00:08:36.807 --> 00:08:40.061
or bums. or divorcing couples.

67
00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:44.524
- What is this about. your image?

68
00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:45.942
Come on. Ralph.

69
00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:47.401
You knew about my husband.

70
00:08:47.401 --> 00:08:49.695
You knew how hard I tried for years

71
00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:50.905
to get him to come to church.

72
00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:52.740
- That's not the point.

73
00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.200
- What is the point?

74
00:08:55.284 --> 00:08:59.121
The Bible says to avoid
all appearances of evil.

75
00:08:59.121 --> 00:09:02.083
And quite frankly. we're just
not doing a good job of that.

76
00:09:04.835 --> 00:09:09.215
It's like evil is just prancing around.

77
00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:12.134
dancing all over our living
rooms for all to see.

78
00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:17.890
- So you're releasing me
from the leadership team?

79
00:09:20.726 --> 00:09:21.561
- We have to.

80
00:09:23.145 --> 00:09:27.149
We can't afford to have any
more rumors going around.

81
00:09:27.149 --> 00:09:29.068
- What am I going to tell my girls

82
00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:31.028
who now do not have a father?

83
00:09:31.028 --> 00:09:32.697
And now. they don't even
have a leadership role

84
00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:33.990
in their own church.

85
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.576
- Oh. this does not affect
your girls in any way.

86
00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:39.328
They are completely fine
to stay where they are.

87
00:09:39.328 --> 00:09:41.414
- Our family is broken up enough

88
00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:44.458
and I will allow no more of it. goodbye.

89
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:53.759
- Was that completely necessary?

90
00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:21.579
- So I was thinking about in my new room.

91
00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:22.663
adding my bed on that one wall-

92
00:10:22.663 --> 00:10:24.040
- Is that the room I want?

93
00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:27.877
- What room are you talking about?

94
00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:29.170
- The room at the end of the hall.

95
00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:30.379
- The one with the big window?

96
00:10:30.379 --> 00:10:32.131
- I told you that's the one I wanted.

97
00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:33.591
- No. that's the one I get.

98
00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:35.551
- Actually guys. I wanted that one.

99
00:10:35.551 --> 00:10:37.345
- No. that's the one I get.

100
00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:39.221
- Do you guys actually
think you're the one

101
00:10:39.221 --> 00:10:40.056
that's getting the room?

102
00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:40.890
- Yes. I do.

103
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:41.724
I do think that.

104
00:10:41.724 --> 00:10:43.017
- And why do you think that?

105
00:10:43.017 --> 00:10:44.560
- Because I should get it.

106
00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.478
- I'm the oldest.

107
00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:46.604
You shouldn't be the one who gets it.

108
00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:49.148
- So. I don't care if you're the oldest.

109
00:10:49.148 --> 00:10:50.691
- I would just really appreciate it

110
00:10:50.691 --> 00:10:52.193
if I was the one that got the room.

111
00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:53.819
- I'm sorry. but you're the oldest

112
00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:55.863
and you always think you
get everything you want.

113
00:10:55.863 --> 00:10:58.491
I'm getting the room.
- Grow up.

114
00:11:05.456 --> 00:11:06.999
- Girls. I've had enough.

115
00:11:06.999 --> 00:11:08.918
Megan. go clean up.

116
00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:10.878
Kayla. go to your room.

117
00:11:10.878 --> 00:11:13.005
- What room?
- What room?

118
00:11:59.844 --> 00:12:03.889
- Dear heavenly Father.
in the name of Jesus.

119
00:12:05.474 --> 00:12:07.476
I just ask you to help me.

120
00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:13.899
I have felt so rejected.

121
00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:19.822
You Lord. You are so good

122
00:12:23.367 --> 00:12:28.372
and You are so faithful Lord.

123
00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:34.962
Forgive me Lord for
letting this bitterness

124
00:12:34.962 --> 00:12:36.464
and pain seep in me.

125
00:12:41.218 --> 00:12:46.223
Just change this heart of
stone into a heart of flesh.

126
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.521
And Lord. help me to forgive Bill.

127
00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:57.985
In fact. right now Lord.
I choose to forgive him.

128
00:13:00.529 --> 00:13:02.740
I forgive him for leaving us.

129
00:13:03.574 --> 00:13:05.785
And Lord. I just ask that
wherever he is right now Lord.

130
00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:07.369
that You would bless him.

131
00:13:07.369 --> 00:13:10.289
And that You would bring
people into his life Lord.

132
00:13:10.289 --> 00:13:11.540
that point to You.

133
00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:16.003
And Lord. that he would
see his deep need for You.

134
00:13:24.386 --> 00:13:27.139
And Lord. I just ask that You
would be with my daughters.

135
00:13:27.139 --> 00:13:29.266
that You would be with our daughters.

136
00:13:29.266 --> 00:13:31.769
I know Lord that You are love.

137
00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:36.315
I just ask that You help them
to see their worth in You.

138
00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:39.568
Lord. I believe that
they are gonna be okay

139
00:13:39.568 --> 00:13:41.487
because they're going to turn to You.

140
00:13:41.487 --> 00:13:43.155
that they're turning to You. Lord.

141
00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:48.869
I know Lord God that they
are turning to You right now

142
00:13:48.869 --> 00:13:51.205
in this time of hardship.

143
00:13:51.205 --> 00:13:53.624
And they are seeking You and
they are finding their worth

144
00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:54.959
in You Lord.

145
00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:56.794
I believe that Lord.

146
00:13:56.794 --> 00:13:59.797
You're saying in Your word.
that all things work for good

147
00:13:59.797 --> 00:14:02.049
for those who love You.
and we love You Lord.

148
00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:05.553
Thank You so much for
all that You do for us.

149
00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:07.555
And thank You for Your love Lord.

150
00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:09.098
We grasp that love Lord.

151
00:14:09.098 --> 00:14:12.768
You are the Lord of Lords
and the King of kings.

152
00:14:12.768 --> 00:14:15.020
and You are the way
the truth and the life.

153
00:14:16.939 --> 00:14:18.649
Thank You Lord for being there.

154
00:14:20.818 --> 00:14:22.528
I commit myself to You Lord.

155
00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:26.240
Please mold me and heal
me and transform me

156
00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.700
to be more like Jesus.

157
00:14:28.826 --> 00:14:31.287
In Jesus' precious name. amen.

158
00:14:54.768 --> 00:14:55.978
Let's just talk about this.

159
00:14:55.978 --> 00:14:57.563
- Look. I've had enough.

160
00:14:57.563 --> 00:14:59.356
I cannot do this anymore.

161
00:15:00.274 --> 00:15:02.234
No. there's no anything!

162
00:15:02.234 --> 00:15:03.152
- We gotta keep trying.

163
00:15:03.152 --> 00:15:04.653
Let's go to church together.

164
00:15:04.653 --> 00:15:05.779
Let's get some counseling.

165
00:15:05.779 --> 00:15:08.324
- Listen. what'll
God for this relationship?

166
00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:10.284
He hasn't been here for 19 years!

167
00:15:10.284 --> 00:15:11.869
- Please Bill.
don't give up on us!

168
00:15:11.869 --> 00:15:13.662
- There is no way.

169
00:15:13.662 --> 00:15:14.872
I can't do this anymore.

170
00:15:14.872 --> 00:15:17.374
I just don't love you anymore.

171
00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.836
- What about the girls?

172
00:15:22.504 --> 00:15:23.797
- What about the girls?

173
00:15:23.797 --> 00:15:25.215
- Don't you care about them?

174
00:15:25.215 --> 00:15:26.050
- Are you kidding?

175
00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:27.301
Of course I care about them!

176
00:15:27.301 --> 00:15:28.928
Do not turn this on me.

177
00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:32.264
You'll pray for me God.

178
00:15:32.264 --> 00:15:35.267
Pray for this marriage that's
been doomed for 19 years.

179
00:15:35.267 --> 00:15:37.394
- Don't give up on us.

180
00:15:37.394 --> 00:15:38.896
- Give up on what?

181
00:15:38.896 --> 00:15:40.689
I don't love you anymore.

182
00:15:40.689 --> 00:15:42.232
Give up on what?

183
00:15:42.232 --> 00:15:44.068
- But what about the girls?

184
00:15:44.068 --> 00:15:45.069
- What about the girls?

185
00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:45.903
What about 'em?

186
00:15:45.903 --> 00:15:46.862
- Don't you care about 'em?

187
00:15:46.862 --> 00:15:51.367
- Do not do this to me.
of course I care about them!

188
00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:52.785
- Oh God!

189
00:16:07.758 --> 00:16:10.135
So I think I'm enjoying
your cat decorations

190
00:16:10.135 --> 00:16:12.096
more than ever before this year.

191
00:16:12.096 --> 00:16:16.558
- Oh wow. so how are you doing?

192
00:16:16.558 --> 00:16:19.603
- So you've heard about
what happened at church?

193
00:16:19.603 --> 00:16:20.437
- Yeah.

194
00:16:21.897 --> 00:16:24.900
- So I'm sitting here
coming to the realization

195
00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:27.987
that everything that I thought
was important in 19 years

196
00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:30.739
is basically just kind of
fallen apart overnight.

197
00:16:30.739 --> 00:16:34.201
And I have to come to the
realization that I have to do it

198
00:16:34.201 --> 00:16:36.328
on my own and start over again.

199
00:16:36.328 --> 00:16:38.455
- You know it doesn't
have to be like that?

200
00:16:39.331 --> 00:16:40.416
- You know what.

201
00:16:40.416 --> 00:16:42.334
something about you
ever since we were kids

202
00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:45.295
is that you just can't seem
or are willing to see things

203
00:16:45.295 --> 00:16:46.296
as they really are.

204
00:16:48.924 --> 00:16:51.176
- Has anyone from church
reached out to you?

205
00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:54.054
- No.

206
00:16:56.598 --> 00:16:59.309
- There are still some of
us who are praying for you.

207
00:16:59.309 --> 00:17:00.144
- Don't say that.

208
00:17:00.144 --> 00:17:01.645
You don't know that.

209
00:17:01.645 --> 00:17:03.564
And don't believe
everything everybody says.

210
00:17:03.564 --> 00:17:06.066
Also just because someone
says they're praying for you.

211
00:17:06.066 --> 00:17:07.443
doesn't mean that they are.

212
00:17:07.443 --> 00:17:08.485
Love is action.

213
00:17:09.653 --> 00:17:10.696
- That's true.

214
00:17:10.696 --> 00:17:12.489
- And we can't just sweep
everything under the rug

215
00:17:12.489 --> 00:17:13.824
and act like it's not happening.

216
00:17:13.824 --> 00:17:14.992
For the first time in my life.

217
00:17:14.992 --> 00:17:17.494
I'm all on my own and I'm
doing it all by myself.

218
00:17:19.121 --> 00:17:21.206
- Listen. you're gonna find another church

219
00:17:21.206 --> 00:17:22.916
and you're gonna make new friends.

220
00:17:22.916 --> 00:17:24.418
- I don't think so.

221
00:17:24.418 --> 00:17:26.837
- What do you want then?

222
00:17:26.837 --> 00:17:28.797
Do you wanna be alone?

223
00:17:28.797 --> 00:17:31.592
- I want to be more selective
on who I allow to be close

224
00:17:31.592 --> 00:17:33.385
to me and my children.

225
00:17:33.385 --> 00:17:35.971
And I'm not looking for church
leadership for starters.

226
00:17:52.112 --> 00:17:55.908
- So guys. our first day
of school is tomorrow.

227
00:17:55.908 --> 00:17:58.577
- I know. do you guys think
we're gonna be popular?

228
00:17:59.578 --> 00:18:01.497
- I highly doubt it Caitlyn.

229
00:18:01.497 --> 00:18:06.502
We're not jocks. movie people.
musicians. we're nobodys.

230
00:18:11.215 --> 00:18:12.049
- I'm a jock.

231
00:18:12.049 --> 00:18:14.301
- And I sing and play ukulele.

232
00:18:14.301 --> 00:18:17.221
You've never been on a
real cross country team

233
00:18:17.221 --> 00:18:22.226
and you are just a
beginner. we're nobodys.

234
00:18:22.476 --> 00:18:25.896
- Maybe so. but I'm no quitter.

235
00:18:25.896 --> 00:18:29.149
- You're just a jock and
you're just a musician.

236
00:18:30.192 --> 00:18:34.363
- Okay.
- I'm a foodie too.

237
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:40.285
- Oh. my.
- I'm also really good

238
00:18:40.911 --> 00:18:44.456
at sewing and my kind of
music never goes out of style.

239
00:18:45.624 --> 00:18:47.167
- What kind of style is that?

240
00:18:47.167 --> 00:18:48.961
- Cute teen rock music.

241
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:54.133
- If you see me at school. don't
look at me. don't touch me.

242
00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:58.804
don't talk to me and especially
don't sit with me at lunch.

243
00:19:31.712 --> 00:19:34.298
- So. are you new here?

244
00:19:34.298 --> 00:19:35.883
- That obvious. huh?

245
00:19:35.883 --> 00:19:36.717
- No. it's just

246
00:19:36.717 --> 00:19:38.510
that there aren't many
attractive girls around here

247
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:41.638
so when one does come around.
it's pretty noticeable.

248
00:19:41.638 --> 00:19:42.681
- Oh really?

249
00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:45.309
I'd say these halls are
full of attractive girls.

250
00:19:45.309 --> 00:19:50.063
So yeah. you're gonna have
to do better than that.

251
00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:53.442
- Hello handsome. who's this?

252
00:19:55.152 --> 00:19:56.153
- It's no one.

253
00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:59.114
I mean. she's new here.

254
00:19:59.114 --> 00:20:00.449
- I'd say so.

255
00:20:00.449 --> 00:20:02.367
- I didn't catch her name though.

256
00:20:02.367 --> 00:20:03.202
- Kayla.

257
00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:05.662
- Braiden. and this is
my girlfriend. Cami.

258
00:20:05.662 --> 00:20:07.623
- So where'd you move from?

259
00:20:07.623 --> 00:20:10.792
- Bakersville. it's about an
hour and a half away from here.

260
00:20:10.792 --> 00:20:11.627
- I see.

261
00:20:12.669 --> 00:20:14.129
- I saw you at our football game.

262
00:20:14.129 --> 00:20:16.089
Yeah. I just forgot to mention.

263
00:20:16.089 --> 00:20:18.967
- Oh right. yeah. that's
much more believable

264
00:20:18.967 --> 00:20:20.636
than the first reason you gave me.

265
00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:23.513
- We should probably get going to class.

266
00:20:23.513 --> 00:20:25.015
It was really nice to see you.

267
00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:26.016
I'll see you around.

268
00:20:26.016 --> 00:20:27.809
- Nice to meet you Carla.

269
00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:33.190
- Kayla. and right back at ya.

270
00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:36.860
This is gonna be an interesting first week

271
00:20:38.028 --> 00:20:39.863
and I never went to a football game.

272
00:20:39.863 --> 00:20:41.240
This is my first day.

273
00:20:49.289 --> 00:20:52.209
- So why am I here again?

274
00:20:52.209 --> 00:20:53.460
- It's just school policy

275
00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:56.255
that when a student goes
through a traumatic event

276
00:20:56.255 --> 00:21:00.050
such as a death or separation
of parents in the household.

277
00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:03.136
or really any other life-changing event

278
00:21:03.136 --> 00:21:08.141
that we allow students to miss
three hours of class per week

279
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.018
to give them counseling.

280
00:21:10.018 --> 00:21:13.605
- Oh. sweet. well. it's well
worth it for the free coffee.

281
00:21:16.483 --> 00:21:19.152
- So how are things at home?

282
00:21:19.152 --> 00:21:21.571
- I mean. fine I guess.

283
00:21:21.571 --> 00:21:24.616
Making some new friends here
and getting involved in band

284
00:21:24.616 --> 00:21:27.202
so yeah. that's really cool.

285
00:21:29.079 --> 00:21:31.248
- You're not having any problems at home?

286
00:21:31.248 --> 00:21:32.666
- Oh. no. not at all.

287
00:21:33.625 --> 00:21:36.169
I just got a new ukulele for my birthday

288
00:21:36.169 --> 00:21:39.006
and me and my sisters
all got their own rooms

289
00:21:39.006 --> 00:21:40.507
for the first time.

290
00:21:40.507 --> 00:21:42.217
So I can't really complain.

291
00:21:43.427 --> 00:21:44.594
- What about your dad?

292
00:21:47.222 --> 00:21:50.100
- Well. I don't really see my dad much.

293
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.893
but I'm sure he's just busy.

294
00:21:54.521 --> 00:21:56.481
This is so good.

295
00:21:56.481 --> 00:21:58.817
Do you think I could have another cup?

296
00:21:58.817 --> 00:22:02.195
I promise I'll tell you
about all my problems.

297
00:22:05.699 --> 00:22:06.867
- She's in denial.

298
00:22:08.076 --> 00:22:09.619
- What do you mean?

299
00:22:09.619 --> 00:22:14.041
- She's suppressing all
this pain and anguish

300
00:22:14.041 --> 00:22:16.752
and not addressing the issues at home.

301
00:22:18.128 --> 00:22:22.758
- That's Caitlyn. that's
how she copes with things.

302
00:22:22.758 --> 00:22:25.093
She's in her own little world.

303
00:22:25.093 --> 00:22:27.637
- Yes well. I think I need to work

304
00:22:27.637 --> 00:22:28.972
with her a little bit more

305
00:22:28.972 --> 00:22:31.099
because if she doesn't
address these issues.

306
00:22:31.099 --> 00:22:33.435
they're gonna manifest themselves

307
00:22:33.435 --> 00:22:38.023
in other ways one day
when you least expect it.

308
00:22:38.023 --> 00:22:41.777
- Okay. do whatever you
feel you need to do.

309
00:22:41.777 --> 00:22:43.904
- Okay well. if you have
any questions or concerns.

310
00:22:43.904 --> 00:22:46.031
give me a call.
- Thank you.

311
00:23:01.171 --> 00:23:02.506
- Hey. are you new here?

312
00:23:02.506 --> 00:23:05.634
- You're like the fifth person
today who's asked me that.

313
00:23:05.634 --> 00:23:07.052
- Oh. sorry.

314
00:23:07.052 --> 00:23:08.178
- It's all good.

315
00:23:08.178 --> 00:23:10.222
At least you came up and said something.

316
00:23:10.222 --> 00:23:12.849
Most. everyone just gives me looks.

317
00:23:12.849 --> 00:23:15.185
- Oh well. most of us
still welcome newcomers.

318
00:23:15.185 --> 00:23:16.728
I'm just terrible with faces.

319
00:23:16.728 --> 00:23:20.065
- Well. I'm the same way
with names so I get ya.

320
00:23:20.065 --> 00:23:22.067
I'm Megan.
- Ashley.

321
00:23:22.067 --> 00:23:24.861
- Tell me that three more
times before we leave tonight.

322
00:23:24.861 --> 00:23:25.737
- Okay. deal.

323
00:23:27.531 --> 00:23:28.573
Well. why don't you just come over here?

324
00:23:28.573 --> 00:23:30.450
I'll introduce you to
the rest of the group.

325
00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:34.871
- Yeah. I just got wait
on the other extensions

326
00:23:34.871 --> 00:23:36.748
of me basically.

327
00:23:36.748 --> 00:23:37.999
- Oh. you're waiting for someone?

328
00:23:37.999 --> 00:23:40.127
- Yeah. my two sisters.

329
00:23:40.127 --> 00:23:41.795
I don't know what's keeping them.

330
00:23:43.171 --> 00:23:44.673
Oh. there they are.

331
00:23:44.673 --> 00:23:45.799
- Sorry. we're late.

332
00:23:45.799 --> 00:23:47.676
Kayla got lost in the five meter building

333
00:23:47.676 --> 00:23:49.845
and my therapy session went over

334
00:23:49.845 --> 00:23:52.472
because I was on the verge of suicide.

335
00:23:52.472 --> 00:23:55.475
- Yeah. I gotta meet with
that counselor tomorrow.

336
00:23:55.475 --> 00:23:57.185
- Me too.

337
00:23:57.185 --> 00:23:59.020
- Well. if it wasn't for the free coffee.

338
00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:00.605
I wouldn't be there.

339
00:24:00.605 --> 00:24:03.859
- Yeah well guys. this is Anna.

340
00:24:03.859 --> 00:24:08.405
- Ashley.
- Ashley. of course. sorry.

341
00:24:08.405 --> 00:24:10.907
- It's okay. y'all can
just join us up here.

342
00:24:10.907 --> 00:24:11.741
- Okay.

343
00:24:22.294 --> 00:24:24.337
- Hey. are you busy?

344
00:24:24.337 --> 00:24:25.338
- Nope. come on in.

345
00:24:27.048 --> 00:24:27.883
- I just wanted to let you know

346
00:24:27.883 --> 00:24:28.925
that I ran some more numbers

347
00:24:28.925 --> 00:24:31.136
from the real estate account
like you wanted me to

348
00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:32.262
and it just so happens that

349
00:24:32.262 --> 00:24:34.514
that piece of property
right at the county line.

350
00:24:34.514 --> 00:24:37.476
all the way up to as far
as the 85 mile marker

351
00:24:39.227 --> 00:24:40.061
is up for sale.

352
00:24:41.062 --> 00:24:42.898
- Okay. and I suppose you
want me to strike a deal

353
00:24:42.898 --> 00:24:44.316
with the owners?

354
00:24:44.316 --> 00:24:45.692
- Absolutely. that's you and Barbara.

355
00:24:45.692 --> 00:24:46.735
That's y'all's forte.

356
00:24:46.735 --> 00:24:47.569
Y'all can handle that.

357
00:24:47.569 --> 00:24:48.403
I've nothing to do with that.

358
00:24:48.403 --> 00:24:50.697
But the reason I wanted to
tell you about it specifically

359
00:24:50.697 --> 00:24:52.324
is ironically enough.

360
00:24:54.117 --> 00:24:57.078
this piece of land is where
your old church is on.

361
00:24:58.205 --> 00:25:00.749
- Okay I mean. and why
would I care about that?

362
00:25:01.666 --> 00:25:02.542
- Well. I don't know.

363
00:25:02.542 --> 00:25:04.127
I just thought you might be interested.

364
00:25:04.127 --> 00:25:06.004
- Ben. what is going on

365
00:25:06.004 --> 00:25:08.757
in that schemish little mind of yours?

366
00:25:08.757 --> 00:25:11.635
- All right. I admit it.

367
00:25:12.719 --> 00:25:13.553
So I was just thinking

368
00:25:13.553 --> 00:25:16.473
that maybe since that
particular plot of land

369
00:25:16.473 --> 00:25:20.143
is say no longer under
government ownership.

370
00:25:20.143 --> 00:25:21.269
- It isn't?

371
00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:23.897
- No. it's actually been
under private ownership

372
00:25:23.897 --> 00:25:26.233
for about the last two
and a half years or so.

373
00:25:26.233 --> 00:25:27.275
The old owners basically just cashed out

374
00:25:27.275 --> 00:25:29.277
and went and got some land further West

375
00:25:29.277 --> 00:25:30.111
or whatever or whatnot.

376
00:25:30.111 --> 00:25:33.782
But anyway. the point is if in fact.

377
00:25:33.782 --> 00:25:36.993
you wanna show your old
little church people whatnot.

378
00:25:36.993 --> 00:25:40.455
once our company acquires
the ownership for that land.

379
00:25:40.455 --> 00:25:41.665
you can do whatever you wanna do with it.

380
00:25:41.665 --> 00:25:42.666
- Like what?

381
00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:49.965
- I don't know. sell it. burn
it to the ground .

382
00:25:53.385 --> 00:25:54.302
Catch you later.

383
00:26:08.024 --> 00:26:11.111
- So girls. how was your first day?

384
00:26:11.111 --> 00:26:11.945
- Good.
- Good.

385
00:26:13.488 --> 00:26:15.615
- Everyone kept staring at us

386
00:26:15.615 --> 00:26:17.951
and commenting about the way we dress.

387
00:26:18.994 --> 00:26:22.872
They kept using this one word.
like consi. consi-something.

388
00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:28.211
- Conservative?

389
00:26:28.211 --> 00:26:30.171
- Right. that's it. conservative.

390
00:26:31.131 --> 00:26:33.883
- Caitlyn. your counselor called today.

391
00:26:33.883 --> 00:26:36.011
She said you're suppressing a lot of pain.

392
00:26:37.804 --> 00:26:41.016
- I am. that coffee causes heartburn

393
00:26:45.228 --> 00:26:47.397
for me after five cups.

394
00:26:47.397 --> 00:26:49.858
- No wonder you can't sleep.

395
00:26:49.858 --> 00:26:51.818
You're doped out on caffeine.

396
00:26:55.405 --> 00:26:56.323
Anybody else?

397
00:26:58.283 --> 00:27:00.285
- I met a cute guy today.

398
00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:07.125
Relax. he's got a girlfriend
much hotter than me.

399
00:27:07.375 --> 00:27:08.543
- I doubt that.

400
00:27:10.211 --> 00:27:11.921
- That's not saying much.

401
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:14.549
- Girls?

402
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:17.218
- I bet you didn't meet a cute guy today.

403
00:27:17.218 --> 00:27:21.014
- Well. I will admit you got me there.

404
00:27:21.014 --> 00:27:22.891
but I did make a new friend.

405
00:27:22.891 --> 00:27:24.934
- Oh yeah.
- Who?

406
00:27:26.186 --> 00:27:27.562
- Her name's Ashley.

407
00:27:27.562 --> 00:27:30.440
She is one of the leaders
of the on-campus crusade.

408
00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:33.109
And she wants us to go to
church with her on Sunday.

409
00:27:33.109 --> 00:27:35.153
- No.
- No?

410
00:27:35.153 --> 00:27:36.946
I already told her we would.

411
00:27:36.946 --> 00:27:39.157
I thought that would be a no brainer.

412
00:27:39.157 --> 00:27:41.993
- Mom. I know how you
feel about what happened.

413
00:27:41.993 --> 00:27:44.663
but you don't want us
to go to church anymore?

414
00:28:06.017 --> 00:28:08.061
- Maybe you can have her over for dinner.

415
00:28:12.023 --> 00:28:13.525
- I'm sure that would be fine.

416
00:28:53.606 --> 00:28:56.443
- No. you just said that. right?

417
00:28:56.443 --> 00:29:00.196
You know. wait. you know
when you're leaving?

418
00:29:28.516 --> 00:29:31.144
- Oh. did you do that all by yourself?

419
00:29:31.144 --> 00:29:34.063
- Oh. it's only 2000 pieces.

420
00:29:34.063 --> 00:29:36.983
You start from the corners
and work your way in.

421
00:29:36.983 --> 00:29:38.067
It's no big deal.

422
00:29:38.985 --> 00:29:42.447
- I see. and how are things at home?

423
00:29:44.824 --> 00:29:48.119
- We're getting along despite
everything that's happened.

424
00:29:48.119 --> 00:29:50.663
- Are you adjusting well to school?

425
00:29:50.663 --> 00:29:52.290
- Well. it's school.

426
00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:54.209
I have to make the most of everything.

427
00:29:55.668 --> 00:29:56.920
I'm the oldest

428
00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.672
so my little sisters look
to me for leadership.

429
00:29:59.672 --> 00:30:02.926
If I'm okay. they can find
it in themselves to be okay.

430
00:30:09.724 --> 00:30:12.018
- Are you finding school challenging?

431
00:30:12.018 --> 00:30:14.687
- My life sucks. okay?

432
00:30:14.687 --> 00:30:17.065
I'm the poster child for the doped up.

433
00:30:17.065 --> 00:30:20.652
can't function. problem
teen of the new generation.

434
00:30:20.652 --> 00:30:22.779
Now. can you just pack me full of Prozac.

435
00:30:22.779 --> 00:30:24.989
or lithium. or tranquilizers.

436
00:30:24.989 --> 00:30:27.700
or canned arsenic for that matter.

437
00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:30.495
or whatever it is you guys prescribe

438
00:30:30.495 --> 00:30:32.956
and send me on my merry way.

439
00:30:32.956 --> 00:30:34.707
I'm missing gym class.

440
00:30:43.132 --> 00:30:44.717
- She said what?

441
00:31:02.944 --> 00:31:04.362
- Hey. you're crazy.

442
00:31:04.362 --> 00:31:06.322
- I'd rather be crazy than be with you.

443
00:31:20.837 --> 00:31:22.922
- Okay last night. your dogs kept me up

444
00:31:22.922 --> 00:31:25.717
for half an hour because he
was scratching in the inside

445
00:31:25.717 --> 00:31:27.468
of the gate.
- Oh my God. what?

446
00:31:27.468 --> 00:31:28.803
- And so. I was a little upset

447
00:31:28.803 --> 00:31:29.762
so I yelled. "Stop!"

448
00:31:32.557 --> 00:31:33.558
- Oh my God.

449
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:37.562
- He listened to me and
I was like. "Fabulous."

450
00:32:24.943 --> 00:32:26.653
- Hey.
- Hey.

451
00:32:26.653 --> 00:32:29.572
- So about church this Sunday.

452
00:32:29.572 --> 00:32:30.698
- You can't come?

453
00:32:30.698 --> 00:32:32.742
- Well. let's just say my mom wants

454
00:32:32.742 --> 00:32:34.786
to get to know you first.

455
00:32:35.912 --> 00:32:37.538
kind of know what she's
getting herself into.

456
00:32:37.538 --> 00:32:39.540
- Oh yeah. of course. that's fine.

457
00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:42.043
- Awesome. could you
come to dinner tonight

458
00:32:42.043 --> 00:32:43.252
or maybe tomorrow night?

459
00:32:44.462 --> 00:32:46.422
- Yeah. tonight can be fine.

460
00:32:46.422 --> 00:32:48.049
- Great. I'm hungry.

461
00:32:48.049 --> 00:32:49.759
My mom makes a lot.
- Okay.

462
00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.237
This is really good. thank you.

463
00:33:09.237 --> 00:33:11.406
- Oh yeah. it is isn't it?

464
00:33:14.325 --> 00:33:16.953
- So Ashley. do you go

465
00:33:16.953 --> 00:33:19.122
to church around here
somewhere close do you?

466
00:33:19.122 --> 00:33:21.416
- Yeah. my dad is actually
the Senior Pastor.

467
00:33:23.501 --> 00:33:26.796
- And your parents aren't
divorced I suppose?

468
00:33:26.796 --> 00:33:27.630
- Mom?

469
00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:29.215
- Oh no. they're very much together

470
00:33:29.215 --> 00:33:30.675
and very much in love.

471
00:33:30.675 --> 00:33:32.176
In fact. I think just last week.

472
00:33:32.176 --> 00:33:35.179
my dad got my mom this really nice gift

473
00:33:35.179 --> 00:33:38.349
and we were so excited.

474
00:33:38.349 --> 00:33:40.893
My dad. oh.

475
00:33:43.104 --> 00:33:45.940
- That's very nice.

476
00:33:54.699 --> 00:33:57.160
Well Ashley. we want our daughters

477
00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:01.372
to be in an environment
that's safe. very safe.

478
00:34:08.588 --> 00:34:12.592
- Well yeah. our church is
definitely in a safe section

479
00:34:12.592 --> 00:34:14.677
of town for sure.

480
00:34:14.677 --> 00:34:18.806
- She means friendly
environment and non-judgemental.

481
00:34:23.269 --> 00:34:28.274
- Oh. oh yeah. our church is
definitely all about that.

482
00:34:28.274 --> 00:34:30.902
The culture of our church
is definitely one of grace.

483
00:34:31.819 --> 00:34:34.238
- Because that's what
our last church said.

484
00:34:35.698 --> 00:34:36.741
- It's okay.

485
00:34:40.161 --> 00:34:43.206
- Mom wouldn't keep us from
going to church would she?

486
00:34:45.166 --> 00:34:46.626
- Where are you going?

487
00:34:46.626 --> 00:34:48.294
- To get a second helping.

488
00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:52.632
- Grab me one more too while
you're out there please.

489
00:34:52.632 --> 00:34:54.842
- You're gonna get fat.

490
00:34:54.842 --> 00:34:58.096
- Nope. I have another 10
years to eat like a pig

491
00:34:58.096 --> 00:35:00.890
before my metabolism catches up with me.

492
00:35:02.975 --> 00:35:04.852
according to my science teacher.

493
00:37:08.017 --> 00:37:09.727
- Oh. here comes Bradley!

494
00:37:09.727 --> 00:37:11.812
- Hey there!

495
00:37:11.812 --> 00:37:13.648
- What's up?

496
00:37:14.815 --> 00:37:15.733
- Hey guys.

497
00:37:25.785 --> 00:37:27.453
- Dude. that girl is staring you down.

498
00:37:27.453 --> 00:37:28.371
- Yeah man.

499
00:39:26.781 --> 00:39:27.948
- Sidney?

500
00:39:27.948 --> 00:39:28.866
- Yeah. that's him. that's Sidney.

501
00:39:28.866 --> 00:39:30.242
- I was almost in the cold.

502
00:39:35.956 --> 00:39:37.583
- My name was almost .

503
00:39:41.253 --> 00:39:42.963
- This is Chadwin's plant. Edward

504
00:39:44.757 --> 00:39:46.759
He's very handsome.

505
00:39:46.759 --> 00:39:48.969
- I used to water him so much.

506
00:39:48.969 --> 00:39:49.845
I don't know why.

507
00:39:55.434 --> 00:39:57.728
- All right. all right everybody.

508
00:39:57.728 --> 00:39:59.688
Thank you guys all for coming.

509
00:39:59.688 --> 00:40:00.940
For those of you who don't know me.

510
00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:02.066
I am Terrence.

511
00:40:02.066 --> 00:40:02.983
I see some new faces.

512
00:40:02.983 --> 00:40:04.693
It's very nice to have you guys.

513
00:40:04.693 --> 00:40:07.488
And this is my lovely fiance. Andrea.

514
00:40:07.488 --> 00:40:10.366
Together. we run the Young Life Program

515
00:40:10.366 --> 00:40:11.492
on Thursday evenings.

516
00:40:11.492 --> 00:40:15.246
or lead or figurehead
this little assembly.

517
00:40:15.246 --> 00:40:16.163
if you will.

518
00:40:17.039 --> 00:40:20.960
So we would like to go around
and introduce each other.

519
00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.420
And I know that you
guys that have been here

520
00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:24.755
for a while have done
this a million times.

521
00:40:24.755 --> 00:40:27.299
but we'd like to make
a level playing field

522
00:40:27.299 --> 00:40:29.427
for all of our newcomers.

523
00:40:29.427 --> 00:40:32.930
So if you want. state your name.

524
00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:36.183
your year in school and how
many years you've been coming

525
00:40:36.183 --> 00:40:37.768
to Living Waters.

526
00:40:37.768 --> 00:40:40.479
And of course a fun fact.

527
00:40:40.479 --> 00:40:42.690
something interesting that
you would like other people

528
00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:44.942
in the group to know about you.

529
00:40:44.942 --> 00:40:46.819
So I'll start as always.

530
00:40:46.819 --> 00:40:49.989
And then Andrea will go and
we'll go around this way.

531
00:40:51.407 --> 00:40:53.951
So again. my name is Terrence.

532
00:40:53.951 --> 00:40:57.037
I am a fourth year at NHU.

533
00:40:57.037 --> 00:41:00.499
I've been coming to Living
Waters for 12 years.

534
00:41:00.499 --> 00:41:01.417
leading for three.

535
00:41:02.334 --> 00:41:05.588
And a fun fact about myself
is that my dad is that Pastor

536
00:41:05.588 --> 00:41:07.423
that you guys all see on TV.

537
00:41:09.592 --> 00:41:11.927
- Hi. I'm Andrea like Terrence said.

538
00:41:11.927 --> 00:41:14.138
I am a junior at NHU.

539
00:41:14.138 --> 00:41:15.681
I've been coming here for five years now.

540
00:41:15.681 --> 00:41:18.726
And my interesting thing is
that I've been in every country

541
00:41:18.726 --> 00:41:20.352
in Europe following the Newsboys.

542
00:41:21.896 --> 00:41:23.647
- Must be nice.

543
00:41:24.648 --> 00:41:25.483
- Kayla!

544
00:41:27.526 --> 00:41:29.403
- Yeah. it was really an experience.

545
00:41:35.367 --> 00:41:37.495
- I'm Braiden. I'm a senior

546
00:41:37.495 --> 00:41:41.081
and this is me and my
girlfriend's first time too.

547
00:41:41.081 --> 00:41:42.833
Interesting fact about me

548
00:41:42.833 --> 00:41:44.335
is that I actually won the MVP

549
00:41:44.335 --> 00:41:46.754
of our high school's football
team two years in a row.

550
00:41:46.754 --> 00:41:48.380
And here's to three.

551
00:41:50.257 --> 00:41:51.967
- Oh. that's where I know you from.

552
00:41:51.967 --> 00:41:53.010
you scored that winning touchdown

553
00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:55.596
against was it Willow Creek last year?

554
00:41:55.596 --> 00:41:57.723
- Yeah. I did it again
against Mountain View.

555
00:41:57.723 --> 00:41:59.058
- Oh yeah. I saw that too.

556
00:41:59.058 --> 00:42:01.185
Heck yeah man. welcome.
- Yeah.

557
00:42:06.607 --> 00:42:09.318
- So I'm Cami. it's my first night here.

558
00:42:09.318 --> 00:42:11.070
I'm a senior at school.

559
00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:12.279
Interesting thing about me

560
00:42:12.279 --> 00:42:14.490
is that I got to interview
Reese Witherspoon

561
00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:16.158
for an article in our magazine.

562
00:42:16.158 --> 00:42:17.952
She was so awesome.

563
00:42:17.952 --> 00:42:19.370
- Wow.

564
00:42:21.789 --> 00:42:23.791
- Hi. I'm Ashley.

565
00:42:23.791 --> 00:42:28.420
I am a senior here at Heath
High and I've been going here

566
00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:30.339
for about four years now.

567
00:42:33.092 --> 00:42:35.678
I'd say the most
interesting thing about me

568
00:42:35.678 --> 00:42:39.139
is that I've read the Bible
four times all the way through.

569
00:42:39.139 --> 00:42:41.809
- Wow. that's interesting.

570
00:42:41.809 --> 00:42:44.228
- Well then. what's
your favorite book then?

571
00:42:44.228 --> 00:42:47.523
- Oh golly. I don't really
have a favorite book.

572
00:42:47.523 --> 00:42:50.025
It's more like I like
the New Testament better

573
00:42:50.025 --> 00:42:51.068
than the Old Testament.

574
00:42:51.068 --> 00:42:53.612
- The New Testament. what
about the Old Testament?

575
00:42:53.612 --> 00:42:56.657
The battles like the Israelites led by.

576
00:42:56.657 --> 00:42:59.451
let's see Moses and Joshua and King David?

577
00:43:00.578 --> 00:43:01.453
- I'm sure your favorite

578
00:43:01.453 --> 00:43:03.747
is the Israelites
getting exiled to Babylon

579
00:43:03.747 --> 00:43:06.333
and that evil King Zedekiah
getting his eyes gouged out

580
00:43:06.333 --> 00:43:08.419
and his sons killed right in front of him.

581
00:43:09.378 --> 00:43:13.674
- Yeah. no.

582
00:43:13.674 --> 00:43:16.635
- Okay. hi. I'm Megan.

583
00:43:16.635 --> 00:43:18.846
I'm here tonight with my two sisters

584
00:43:18.846 --> 00:43:21.807
and I'll let them introduce themselves.

585
00:43:21.807 --> 00:43:25.477
I am new to Heath High
going into my senior year

586
00:43:25.477 --> 00:43:27.271
and this is our first night here.

587
00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:31.692
I guess my interesting thing
about me/accomplishment

588
00:43:31.692 --> 00:43:35.404
is I won state title for
individual track last year.

589
00:43:35.404 --> 00:43:39.658
- Wow.
- Wow.

590
00:43:42.995 --> 00:43:46.498
- Hi. I'm Caitlyn. and like she said.

591
00:43:46.498 --> 00:43:50.711
first time here and
interesting thing about me

592
00:43:50.711 --> 00:43:54.173
is I'm awesome at everything I do.

593
00:43:55.633 --> 00:43:57.843
No. I'm just kidding.

594
00:43:57.843 --> 00:43:59.595
I'm a singer/songwriter.

595
00:44:01.388 --> 00:44:06.352
- Oh. that's cool.
- Wow.

596
00:44:12.399 --> 00:44:17.112
- I'm Kayla. first time and
nothing interesting about me.

597
00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:20.574
- Oh come on. I'm sure there's something.

598
00:44:20.574 --> 00:44:25.579
- No. no famous dad or any
dad really for that matter.

599
00:44:25.996 --> 00:44:28.415
No track star crap. no music.

600
00:44:34.421 --> 00:44:39.051
no trophies. no state title. no football

601
00:44:39.051 --> 00:44:41.929
no "Legally blonde" actresses. no Europe.

602
00:44:51.814 --> 00:44:53.148
- Well. I'm sure you've accomplished more

603
00:44:53.148 --> 00:44:54.441
than you think you have.

604
00:44:55.442 --> 00:44:57.486
- She just hasn't found her niche yet.

605
00:44:58.320 --> 00:44:59.863
- Well. just remember

606
00:44:59.863 --> 00:45:02.408
that you're a child of
God first and foremost.

607
00:45:02.408 --> 00:45:05.119
Hold fast to that and build from there.

608
00:45:05.119 --> 00:45:06.787
- Now you sound like my mom.

609
00:45:07.663 --> 00:45:10.624
- Okay. so before we turn
this into a pity party

610
00:45:10.624 --> 00:45:12.835
for whining losers. let's move on.

611
00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:19.466
- Well. thanks for coming tonight guys.

612
00:45:19.466 --> 00:45:20.926
And thanks for sharing.

613
00:45:20.926 --> 00:45:22.219
Kayla is not alone.

614
00:45:22.219 --> 00:45:24.555
We understand many of you guys
are going through hard times

615
00:45:24.555 --> 00:45:26.098
that you don't wanna talk about tonight.

616
00:45:26.098 --> 00:45:28.225
And we completely understand.

617
00:45:28.225 --> 00:45:31.145
We just hope the message
tonight blesses you.

618
00:45:31.145 --> 00:45:32.730
By the way Ashley.

619
00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:35.399
I think we can all agree
that the Old Testament

620
00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:37.568
is not as good as the New Testament.

621
00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:44.074
Speaking of which. that brings
us to the topic of the night.

622
00:45:45.409 --> 00:45:50.414
So this semester. we will be
focusing on. drum roll please.

623
00:45:56.545 --> 00:45:58.839
Now. I'm going to use an old term here

624
00:45:58.839 --> 00:46:02.176
and it's something that's
very important to us.

625
00:46:02.176 --> 00:46:03.677
And it's something that
we're all called to be

626
00:46:03.677 --> 00:46:06.263
as individuals and as a church.

627
00:46:07.139 --> 00:46:09.308
And this is a little cliche.

628
00:46:09.308 --> 00:46:12.352
a little misplaced. overused ministers.

629
00:46:14.146 --> 00:46:15.981
We're called to minister or to effect.

630
00:46:15.981 --> 00:46:18.525
but a word I think better describes it

631
00:46:18.525 --> 00:46:20.778
is to impact.

632
00:46:22.070 --> 00:46:25.616
We're all called to
impact those around us.

633
00:46:26.617 --> 00:46:28.577
And it's not just our friends and the ones

634
00:46:28.577 --> 00:46:30.871
that are closest to us.

635
00:46:30.871 --> 00:46:32.706
We're called to impact even those

636
00:46:32.706 --> 00:46:34.333
that are farthest from God.

637
00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:39.880
So the question that we wanna ask tonight

638
00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:42.883
is how often have we been doing that?

639
00:46:46.678 --> 00:46:48.180
I know I'm not perfect.

640
00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:51.475
There's plenty of people that
I run into in my everyday life

641
00:46:51.475 --> 00:46:54.102
that I am frankly too busy for.

642
00:46:55.312 --> 00:46:58.732
And other times I say that I'm too busy

643
00:46:58.732 --> 00:47:01.443
even though there's a million
other things I could be doing

644
00:47:01.443 --> 00:47:02.277
at the moment.

645
00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:07.157
So with that. let's open Ephesians 4.

646
00:47:08.325 --> 00:47:12.204
and there's a verse that
I want you to go over.

647
00:47:12.204 --> 00:47:15.207
I think it speak a little
bit of truth into this.

648
00:47:15.207 --> 00:47:18.001
Start with verse 29 alrighty.

649
00:47:22.089 --> 00:47:25.843
"No foul language should
come out of your mouths.

650
00:47:25.843 --> 00:47:29.429
"but only such as is good
for needed edification

651
00:47:29.429 --> 00:47:32.224
"that it may impart
grace to those who hear.

652
00:47:34.017 --> 00:47:37.187
"And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God

653
00:47:37.187 --> 00:47:40.899
"with which you were sealed
for the day of redemption.

654
00:47:43.026 --> 00:47:47.406
"All bitterness. fury. anger. shouting.

655
00:47:48.407 --> 00:47:52.870
"inner viling must be removed
from you along with all

656
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:53.787
"of their malice.

657
00:47:54.955 --> 00:47:59.585
"And be kind to one
another. compassionate.

658
00:47:59.585 --> 00:48:04.172
"forgiving one another as God
has forgiven you in Christ."

659
00:48:06.758 --> 00:48:09.094
- I think these are all
verses that we kind of know

660
00:48:09.094 --> 00:48:10.971
in our heads. but it's
not really something

661
00:48:10.971 --> 00:48:13.640
that we practice on a day-to-day basis.

662
00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:16.560
hasn't really penetrated our hearts.

663
00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:19.354
In our modern Western Christian culture.

664
00:48:19.354 --> 00:48:21.773
we're so focused on the
importance of our lives

665
00:48:21.773 --> 00:48:23.984
and our schedules that we're not focusing

666
00:48:23.984 --> 00:48:25.319
on what's really important.

667
00:48:28.822 --> 00:48:32.284
even if we ourselves don't
think we're important or matter.

668
00:49:03.899 --> 00:49:07.319
- Hey. I just wanted to give
some words of encouragement.

669
00:49:07.319 --> 00:49:08.570
Megan told me you guys

670
00:49:08.570 --> 00:49:11.448
were kind of going through
a hard time right now.

671
00:49:11.448 --> 00:49:14.159
- Yeah. she talks too much.

672
00:49:14.159 --> 00:49:15.786
- Yeah. some of us do.

673
00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:18.664
I just wanted to know if you wanted

674
00:49:18.664 --> 00:49:20.749
to maybe get some coffee sometime?

675
00:49:20.749 --> 00:49:23.710
I'd love to hear your story
and see what we can do to help.

676
00:49:24.586 --> 00:49:28.215
- I appreciate the gesture Miss. Europe.

677
00:49:28.215 --> 00:49:31.635
but I really don't think
that's the best idea.

678
00:49:44.189 --> 00:49:46.233
How's Saturday morning sound?

679
00:49:46.233 --> 00:49:48.318
- Sounds good. I'll write down my number.

680
00:50:24.604 --> 00:50:26.398
- Hey. thank you so much
for inviting me over

681
00:50:26.398 --> 00:50:27.315
to dinner the other night.

682
00:50:27.315 --> 00:50:28.150
It was so fun.

683
00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:30.152
- Yeah. thanks for inviting me to this.

684
00:50:30.152 --> 00:50:31.486
- I'm so glad you all came.

685
00:50:31.486 --> 00:50:33.238
- Yeah. thanks for inviting us.

686
00:50:34.281 --> 00:50:39.286
Also. would you keep
Kayla in your prayers?

687
00:50:39.411 --> 00:50:41.538
Our family's been going through divorce

688
00:50:41.538 --> 00:50:43.957
and she hasn't been taking it very well.

689
00:50:43.957 --> 00:50:45.959
- Oh no. yeah. absolutely.

690
00:50:48.003 --> 00:50:49.629
And about the other night. I'm so sorry.

691
00:50:49.629 --> 00:50:52.632
I did not know you guys
were going through that.

692
00:50:52.632 --> 00:50:53.884
- No. it's okay.

693
00:50:53.884 --> 00:50:56.053
I'm the one that should
have said something.

694
00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:58.764
- We should get together sometime.

695
00:50:58.764 --> 00:50:59.765
- Yeah. we should.

696
00:50:59.765 --> 00:51:00.932
We should go to a coffee shop.

697
00:51:00.932 --> 00:51:02.476
- I love coffee.

698
00:51:10.942 --> 00:51:12.277
- Hey!
- Oh. hey.

699
00:51:14.988 --> 00:51:17.699
- I'm old enough to know
when it's time to skedaddle.

700
00:51:17.699 --> 00:51:19.451
- Where do you think you're going?

701
00:51:19.451 --> 00:51:21.953
- You two have to talk.

702
00:51:21.953 --> 00:51:23.830
- You're not escaping that easily.

703
00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:27.334
- Come on. you know it's new
guy. new girl. they meet.

704
00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:31.379
- Quit your babbling and get over here.

705
00:51:31.379 --> 00:51:32.839
- Oh. okay.

706
00:51:34.007 --> 00:51:35.884
- So cool message tonight. huh?

707
00:51:35.884 --> 00:51:37.010
- Yeah. for sure.

708
00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:38.011
You can never hear too much

709
00:51:38.011 --> 00:51:40.472
about loving others. huh Caitlyn?

710
00:51:40.472 --> 00:51:42.891
- Yeah. love is dope.

711
00:51:44.726 --> 00:51:46.520
- Well. I just wanted to let you know

712
00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:47.729
that some of us are going
to see that new movie

713
00:51:47.729 --> 00:51:49.272
at the theater downtown on Saturday

714
00:51:49.272 --> 00:51:53.693
and you're welcome to join us if you want.

715
00:51:53.693 --> 00:51:55.862
- Yeah. that's so nice of you.

716
00:51:55.862 --> 00:51:58.698
I'll check my schedule
and let you know tomorrow.

717
00:52:00.367 --> 00:52:03.120
- Hi. you social butterfly.

718
00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:04.371
- She knows what I do.

719
00:52:04.371 --> 00:52:06.123
- Yeah. you again.

720
00:52:06.123 --> 00:52:09.709
- Yes.
- I invited her

721
00:52:09.709 --> 00:52:12.129
to come to the movies with
our group on Saturday.

722
00:52:12.129 --> 00:52:14.047
- Our group. what group?

723
00:52:14.047 --> 00:52:16.466
It was just supposed to be the two of us.

724
00:52:16.466 --> 00:52:18.009
- Well. plans change.

725
00:52:19.052 --> 00:52:23.849
- Oh. I mean. she's a very busy girl.

726
00:52:23.849 --> 00:52:26.351
She probably doesn't have
time for us on Saturday.

727
00:52:27.269 --> 00:52:30.689
- You know what. that reminds me.

728
00:52:30.689 --> 00:52:34.317
I actually have a birthday gig to go to

729
00:52:34.317 --> 00:52:35.694
with my sister Saturday.

730
00:52:35.694 --> 00:52:37.612
- We do?

731
00:52:37.612 --> 00:52:41.575
Oh right. Owen Sue. of course. my bad.

732
00:52:42.784 --> 00:52:44.661
- So maybe next time.

733
00:52:45.996 --> 00:52:46.872
- Next time.

734
00:52:49.791 --> 00:52:52.210
- Great. see y'all round.

735
00:52:52.210 --> 00:52:53.211
- See you next week.

736
00:52:54.171 --> 00:52:56.548
- What. you'll see are next week?

737
00:52:56.548 --> 00:53:01.011
- Heartbreaker. you're
gonna be a heartbreaker.

738
00:53:01.011 --> 00:53:03.054
- Shut up. you're not big enough

739
00:53:03.054 --> 00:53:05.223
to where I still can't kick your butt.

740
00:54:06.618 --> 00:54:08.370
- Good morning. everyone.

741
00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:10.288
It's another beautiful Sunday morning.

742
00:54:11.831 --> 00:54:12.666
With heavy hearts.

743
00:54:12.666 --> 00:54:15.794
we have an announcement
that we need to make.

744
00:54:15.794 --> 00:54:20.799
It's gonna be hard for some of
you congregation to swallow.

745
00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:23.969
It's certainly very difficult for us.

746
00:54:23.969 --> 00:54:26.179
but our church has reached a decision

747
00:54:29.474 --> 00:54:31.893
and we regret to inform everyone.

748
00:54:38.191 --> 00:54:40.110
- Babe. did you see Stacy?

749
00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:41.987
I mean. she was judging me

750
00:54:41.987 --> 00:54:44.072
especially when the
offering was going around.

751
00:54:44.072 --> 00:54:46.574
She was watching how much
we were putting in there.

752
00:54:46.574 --> 00:54:48.702
Babe. I'm just feeling a
lot of judgment right now.

753
00:54:48.702 --> 00:54:51.496
Did you see the way that
Stacy looked at you?

754
00:54:51.496 --> 00:54:52.539
- Yeah. I did. but I don't
think it was because of him.

755
00:54:54.291 --> 00:54:56.001
- We need to talk to them about it.

756
00:54:56.001 --> 00:54:57.919
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

757
00:54:57.919 --> 00:54:59.629
- Why do you have to
make everything a joke?

758
00:54:59.629 --> 00:55:00.463
It's not a joke.

759
00:55:00.463 --> 00:55:01.339
It's not funny. I'm serious.

760
00:55:01.339 --> 00:55:04.009
- It's very healing to people.

761
00:55:04.009 --> 00:55:06.511
- Babe. I just feel like
everyone's judging us.

762
00:55:06.511 --> 00:55:08.388
I mean. did you see Connie?
- Yeah.

763
00:55:08.388 --> 00:55:09.472
- The way that she looked at us.

764
00:55:09.472 --> 00:55:11.808
- She smells funny today. it's weird.

765
00:55:11.808 --> 00:55:13.852
- I think it's her grandmother's perfume.

766
00:55:15.103 --> 00:55:17.897
So we need to not say anything about that.

767
00:55:17.897 --> 00:55:19.524
- Hey.
- Hi!

768
00:55:24.321 --> 00:55:27.615
It's just so hard what's going in.

769
00:55:27.615 --> 00:55:29.117
I'm so sorry about all that.

770
00:55:29.117 --> 00:55:30.827
- It is. yeah.

771
00:55:30.827 --> 00:55:33.872
Pastor Smith and his wife
have been here for 20 years.

772
00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:37.167
- I know. it's heartbreaking.

773
00:55:37.167 --> 00:55:38.126
- And we're here to support him

774
00:55:38.126 --> 00:55:39.669
and his family any way we can.

775
00:55:42.756 --> 00:55:44.507
- Paul. you're on the board.

776
00:55:44.507 --> 00:55:46.426
I mean. I hate to keep
airing dirty laundry.

777
00:55:46.426 --> 00:55:49.095
but did you have anything to do with this?

778
00:55:51.431 --> 00:55:54.392
- It was a business decision
that we needed to make

779
00:55:54.392 --> 00:55:57.270
and it's been staring us in
the face for a while now.

780
00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:59.189
We tried to come up with
alternate solutions.

781
00:55:59.189 --> 00:56:01.107
but let's face it. our
membership is dwindling

782
00:56:01.107 --> 00:56:04.277
and we're just not getting
the offerings that we used to.

783
00:56:06.321 --> 00:56:08.073
People wanna keep blowing
this out of proportion

784
00:56:08.073 --> 00:56:10.909
like it's a direct stab to
Pastor Smith and his family.

785
00:56:10.909 --> 00:56:13.286
It's not. it's not personal at all.

786
00:56:13.286 --> 00:56:15.705
- No.
- We don't wanna see him go.

787
00:56:17.290 --> 00:56:19.209
but it was a business decision.

788
00:56:19.209 --> 00:56:22.337
And you would have done the
same thing at your company.

789
00:56:22.337 --> 00:56:24.422
When the numbers are
down as tough as it is.

790
00:56:24.422 --> 00:56:25.298
you do layoffs.

791
00:56:25.298 --> 00:56:27.759
It's how every business in the world works

792
00:56:28.593 --> 00:56:30.762
and we gotta do what's
best for the church.

793
00:56:33.932 --> 00:56:34.766
- I understand.

794
00:56:36.559 --> 00:56:39.229
- Well. if you'll excuse me.
I'll go pick up the kids.

795
00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:44.484
- Get up.

796
00:56:46.152 --> 00:56:48.947
- So hey Ralph. we got any
of that tripping budget left

797
00:56:48.947 --> 00:56:49.781
by any chance?

798
00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:52.325
- No. we're fresh out.

799
00:56:52.325 --> 00:56:54.035
- Well. come on baby.

800
00:56:54.035 --> 00:56:56.913
we're probably the next
ones to get kicked out.

801
00:56:57.789 --> 00:56:59.374
- Are you going to group lunch?

802
00:56:59.374 --> 00:57:02.043
- Yeah. yeah.

803
00:57:03.211 --> 00:57:04.879
- Okay. I'll save you a seat.

804
00:57:08.383 --> 00:57:12.011
- This place has become a laughing stock.

805
00:57:12.011 --> 00:57:13.805
- Hey. can I talk to you for a second?

806
00:57:16.307 --> 00:57:18.059
- Why do you always have to be a joker?

807
00:57:18.059 --> 00:57:19.644
- Because it's funny.

808
00:57:19.644 --> 00:57:23.440
- It's not. seriously stop it. shut up.

809
00:57:25.316 --> 00:57:28.653
- I just wanted to ask
you about what's going on.

810
00:57:28.653 --> 00:57:30.697
I mean. I talked to you about
what happened with my sister.

811
00:57:30.697 --> 00:57:32.907
but now Pastor Smith?

812
00:57:32.907 --> 00:57:34.909
What is happening with our church?

813
00:57:34.909 --> 00:57:39.914
- I know. honestly.
I've been really praying

814
00:57:40.039 --> 00:57:42.250
about what's been going on lately.

815
00:57:42.250 --> 00:57:44.711
And especially with your sister.

816
00:57:44.711 --> 00:57:45.837
I don't even fully agree

817
00:57:45.837 --> 00:57:49.174
with the decisions being made about that.

818
00:57:49.174 --> 00:57:52.719
And I just feel like our
church panics at the first sign

819
00:57:52.719 --> 00:57:53.511
of a problem.

820
00:57:53.511 --> 00:57:57.348
and I'm just really
feeling convicted about it.

821
00:58:17.494 --> 00:58:20.663
- I can't believe they did this to us.

822
00:58:22.790 --> 00:58:25.877
They can't do this to us.

823
00:58:25.877 --> 00:58:29.047
The church wouldn't even
exist without you Harold.

824
00:58:29.047 --> 00:58:32.592
- Honey. technically they
can. but you have to remember.

825
00:58:32.592 --> 00:58:37.555
they're responsible for the
church's financial future.

826
00:58:37.597 --> 00:58:40.975
I mean. if tithes and
offerings aren't up to par.

827
00:58:40.975 --> 00:58:43.186
and you have to admit they
haven't been for quite a while.

828
00:58:43.186 --> 00:58:45.772
then sacrifices have to be made.

829
00:58:47.106 --> 00:58:47.941
- But why us?

830
00:58:49.317 --> 00:58:51.861
We are the church.

831
00:58:52.904 --> 00:58:54.239
They wouldn't be anywhere near

832
00:58:54.239 --> 00:58:56.074
where they are today without us.

833
00:58:57.492 --> 00:59:00.620
- You have to understand
that we get paid generously

834
00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:01.621
for what we do.

835
00:59:03.289 --> 00:59:07.001
Look. you have to stop looking at it

836
00:59:07.001 --> 00:59:10.004
as what they've done to us.

837
00:59:10.004 --> 00:59:13.716
rather more what God is doing through us

838
00:59:13.716 --> 00:59:15.927
in this unfortunate situation.

839
00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:21.391
- Are you gonna fight it Harold?

840
00:59:21.391 --> 00:59:23.768
Don't you feel it's unjust?

841
00:59:25.436 --> 00:59:28.856
- I could Amanda. but what
would I really be fighting for?

842
00:59:30.191 --> 00:59:33.069
And what kind of example
would we be leading

843
00:59:33.069 --> 00:59:36.531
especially to those who know
us at church and beyond?

844
00:59:37.824 --> 00:59:41.828
Look honey. we have to pray over this

845
00:59:42.787 --> 00:59:47.750
and see what God does in the
meantime in providing for us.

846
00:59:48.251 --> 00:59:52.005
in meeting our needs and
then what the next step is.

847
00:59:54.465 --> 00:59:56.551
- You can't fool me Harold.

848
00:59:58.303 --> 01:00:00.888
You're just as worried as I am.

849
01:00:02.765 --> 01:00:04.684
- We'll get through it.

850
01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:21.284
- Look. I need to get
something straight with you.

851
01:00:22.243 --> 01:00:25.163
- Okay.
- Braiden's mine. okay?

852
01:00:25.163 --> 01:00:27.123
I've seen the way you've
been flirting with him.

853
01:00:27.123 --> 01:00:28.750
- Flirting?

854
01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:29.792
- Last week at Bible study.

855
01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:32.003
he couldn't keep his eyes
off of you all night.

856
01:00:32.003 --> 01:00:33.838
- And that's my fault?

857
01:00:33.838 --> 01:00:35.673
- You and your sisters
parade yourself around

858
01:00:35.673 --> 01:00:36.799
like you're something special.

859
01:00:36.799 --> 01:00:39.135
You show up at a new school
with your perfect clothes

860
01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:41.095
and your crazy hair.

861
01:00:41.095 --> 01:00:43.598
You don't keep quiet like the others.

862
01:00:43.598 --> 01:00:46.017
You just show up. guns blazing.

863
01:00:46.017 --> 01:00:49.646
- Look girl. Braiden.
you can have him. okay.

864
01:00:51.064 --> 01:00:52.523
Let's just say he's not my type.

865
01:00:52.523 --> 01:00:54.275
- Oh. he's not good enough for you?

866
01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:58.613
- You're jealous. it's obvious.

867
01:00:58.613 --> 01:01:01.532
- Oh honey. don't play with the big girls.

868
01:01:01.532 --> 01:01:05.662
You don't wanna play in
the big leagues I promise.

869
01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:08.581
You we're in way. way over your head.

870
01:01:08.581 --> 01:01:12.251
- I got to go to class. but yeah.

871
01:01:12.251 --> 01:01:14.962
try to have more confidence in yourself.

872
01:01:14.962 --> 01:01:17.924
I mean. Braiden's not stalking me yet.

873
01:01:17.924 --> 01:01:20.635
He's still talking to you. right?

874
01:01:26.057 --> 01:01:30.228
- Okay. you want war.

875
01:01:30.228 --> 01:01:31.145
I'll give you war.

876
01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:33.398
Two can play that game.

877
01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.332
- So you and your family
are new to the area?

878
01:01:54.669 --> 01:01:56.796
- What's left of us. yeah.

879
01:01:56.796 --> 01:01:58.589
- Yeah. Ashley told me you guys

880
01:01:58.589 --> 01:02:00.049
were going through a divorce.

881
01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:02.301
- Oh she did huh?

882
01:02:03.177 --> 01:02:05.638
- I'm sorry. I was just trying to help.

883
01:02:05.638 --> 01:02:07.765
- Not only did I go through a divorce

884
01:02:07.765 --> 01:02:08.850
when I was eight years old.

885
01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:12.395
but the man my mom was married
to wasn't even my real dad.

886
01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:15.148
I was what the church would
call an illegitimate child.

887
01:02:16.691 --> 01:02:19.777
- I'm what you would call
not the brightest crown

888
01:02:19.777 --> 01:02:20.945
in the box.

889
01:02:20.945 --> 01:02:22.905
I'm sorry. what's that mean?

890
01:02:22.905 --> 01:02:27.326
- Oh. I was born out of wedlock
and for the longest time.

891
01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:32.081
I really. really
struggled with my identity

892
01:02:32.081 --> 01:02:35.418
as a person and my
certainty as a child of God.

893
01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:38.546
I mean. I wasn't even supposed to exist.

894
01:02:38.546 --> 01:02:41.090
I was a result of my parents' sin

895
01:02:42.133 --> 01:02:44.677
and being in the middle of a divorce.

896
01:02:44.677 --> 01:02:47.555
it's like. how can God honestly love me

897
01:02:47.555 --> 01:02:49.098
and have a plan for me?

898
01:02:49.098 --> 01:02:50.391
I believed it for everyone else.

899
01:02:50.391 --> 01:02:52.769
but I couldn't accept it for myself.

900
01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:56.647
And I was just so afraid that
one day it would be revealed

901
01:02:56.647 --> 01:03:00.026
to me that I wouldn't inherit
the great things from God

902
01:03:00.026 --> 01:03:03.029
that my pastors and my religious people

903
01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:04.447
that I knew growing up would.

904
01:03:07.283 --> 01:03:11.329
It took me a long time to
realize that we're all here

905
01:03:11.329 --> 01:03:12.914
for a reason.

906
01:03:12.914 --> 01:03:17.126
And God loves to take people
from broken circumstances

907
01:03:17.126 --> 01:03:19.545
and make them into something wonderful.

908
01:03:19.545 --> 01:03:20.546
that's what He does.

909
01:03:21.506 --> 01:03:24.509
- When I first came here.
no one ever talked to me.

910
01:03:24.509 --> 01:03:27.220
People would pass right by
me and not even say a word.

911
01:03:28.846 --> 01:03:30.139
Guys that I would talk to.

912
01:03:31.682 --> 01:03:33.643
They would just say they were too busy.

913
01:03:34.977 --> 01:03:37.522
Then the next week. they'd
be with another girl.

914
01:03:41.776 --> 01:03:43.069
It upset me to the point

915
01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:44.654
that I felt like I wasn't good enough

916
01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:47.990
to be in a relationship
with a good Christian man.

917
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:50.451
I felt like I didn't fit in
with the Christian circle.

918
01:03:51.452 --> 01:03:53.120
If God loved me so much.

919
01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:55.706
then why did I mean so
little to His other children.

920
01:04:00.002 --> 01:04:02.547
- I appreciate you all
sharing your stories with me.

921
01:04:04.382 --> 01:04:06.467
- You feel similar because your dad left?

922
01:04:07.969 --> 01:04:12.098
- Honestly. I'm not really
sure how I'm feeling about it.

923
01:04:12.098 --> 01:04:14.183
- Were you close with your dad?

924
01:04:14.183 --> 01:04:16.894
- Still am. he says him
leaving mom had nothing

925
01:04:16.894 --> 01:04:18.145
to do with us.

926
01:04:20.773 --> 01:04:22.024
- You believe him. right?

927
01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:25.653
- I guess.

928
01:04:27.488 --> 01:04:29.407
- I guess what we're trying to say

929
01:04:29.407 --> 01:04:33.160
is that you shouldn't let this experience

930
01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:37.206
define your relationship with
God and how you view God.

931
01:04:38.708 --> 01:04:41.294
God wants us to fight for
our relationship with Him

932
01:04:41.294 --> 01:04:44.297
and our relationship with
our spouses and others.

933
01:04:47.425 --> 01:04:48.718
- Thanks.

934
01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:50.970
- Do you mind if we pray for you?

935
01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:51.804
- Sure.

936
01:04:58.978 --> 01:05:01.981
- Heavenly Father. I
pray for Kayla right now.

937
01:05:01.981 --> 01:05:03.858
Please give her a peace and a comfort

938
01:05:03.858 --> 01:05:06.152
that only You can give.

939
01:05:06.152 --> 01:05:09.238
I pray that we would
be good friends to her

940
01:05:09.238 --> 01:05:11.532
and that we would understand and help her

941
01:05:11.532 --> 01:05:12.867
and that she would understand

942
01:05:12.867 --> 01:05:15.578
that we're glorifying You.

943
01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:20.583
I pray God that You'd please
give her family comfort

944
01:05:21.292 --> 01:05:25.880
and that she'd be able to
fit in well with school.

945
01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:30.885
that You'd help her with
school and all her friends.

946
01:05:31.552 --> 01:05:33.638
I pray that she'd start
making more friends

947
01:05:33.638 --> 01:05:38.434
and that she would grow in You
and a relationship with You

948
01:05:38.434 --> 01:05:39.810
and her family.

949
01:05:39.810 --> 01:05:42.438
Please give her and her
family a peace and a comfort

950
01:05:42.438 --> 01:05:44.482
that only You can give.

951
01:05:44.482 --> 01:05:46.442
I pray that we give blessing to her

952
01:05:46.442 --> 01:05:48.235
and that we'd encourage her

953
01:05:48.235 --> 01:05:50.404
and that she would be blessed by us

954
01:05:50.404 --> 01:05:55.409
and want to turn to You
Lord for everything.

955
01:05:55.534 --> 01:05:59.080
I pray that we all would
be more dependent on You

956
01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:03.459
and rely on who Christ is
and what He has done for us

957
01:06:03.459 --> 01:06:04.543
on the cross.

958
01:06:09.465 --> 01:06:12.051
- And Lord. I just pray
that you please just protect

959
01:06:12.051 --> 01:06:13.469
and guard Kayla's heart

960
01:06:13.469 --> 01:06:15.471
as she goes through these uncertain times.

961
01:06:15.471 --> 01:06:17.807
And I pray for Your hand to just be

962
01:06:17.807 --> 01:06:20.768
on her whole family right
now during these times Lord.

963
01:06:20.768 --> 01:06:22.687
And I pray that You just
help her to keep in mind

964
01:06:22.687 --> 01:06:25.815
that she's a child of God
first and foremost Lord.

965
01:06:25.815 --> 01:06:29.110
And I just pray for Your love
to just show in her life Lord.

966
01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:30.569
And thank You for these amazing times

967
01:06:30.569 --> 01:06:31.904
that we've got together.

968
01:06:31.904 --> 01:06:34.365
And all the things I ask
in Your holy name. amen.

969
01:06:34.365 --> 01:06:36.158
- Amen.
- Amen. thank you.

970
01:07:00.266 --> 01:07:01.517
- Good morning.

971
01:07:01.517 --> 01:07:03.436
- Hey. how are you doing?

972
01:07:03.436 --> 01:07:05.062
- Moving right along. I suppose.

973
01:07:05.062 --> 01:07:06.022
And you?

974
01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:08.357
- Great. I have the afternoon off work

975
01:07:08.357 --> 01:07:11.235
so I'm gonna go do a little
early Christmas shopping.

976
01:07:11.235 --> 01:07:13.529
You and the girls still
coming over on Friday?

977
01:07:13.529 --> 01:07:16.699
- Of course. the girls
are excited to see you.

978
01:07:16.699 --> 01:07:18.784
- Hey. I heard you found a new church.

979
01:07:21.662 --> 01:07:22.955
- They're exploring other options

980
01:07:22.955 --> 01:07:24.373
with their friends at school.

981
01:07:25.332 --> 01:07:27.418
They haven't really convinced
me to come along yet.

982
01:07:27.418 --> 01:07:28.335
- Well. why not?

983
01:07:28.335 --> 01:07:31.589
I figured you'd be excited
to start somewhere new?

984
01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:33.466
- You know that I'm not
going to keep my daughters

985
01:07:33.466 --> 01:07:34.967
from going back to church.

986
01:07:34.967 --> 01:07:36.343
I just would never do that.

987
01:07:37.553 --> 01:07:39.680
It's just my job to protect them.

988
01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:41.599
And naturally. I'm afraid

989
01:07:41.599 --> 01:07:44.393
that they're going to be
greatly disappointed again.

990
01:07:44.393 --> 01:07:46.395
I just don't want them to
turn their backs on God

991
01:07:46.395 --> 01:07:49.065
because of the wrongs that the
church has done toward them.

992
01:07:50.107 --> 01:07:51.859
I just wish they would have waited.

993
01:07:53.486 --> 01:07:55.404
- It is all part of the plan Darla.

994
01:07:55.404 --> 01:07:57.031
I want you to believe that.

995
01:07:57.031 --> 01:07:59.492
Anyway. I was calling because
I wanted to let you know

996
01:07:59.492 --> 01:08:00.951
about something that happened at church.

997
01:08:00.951 --> 01:08:02.453
It might make you feel better.

998
01:08:03.454 --> 01:08:04.747
- I'm all ears.

999
01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:06.957
I need some good news about right now.

1000
01:08:06.957 --> 01:08:09.335
- Well. I wouldn't say
that it's good news.

1001
01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:10.753
Pastor Smith got let go.

1002
01:08:10.753 --> 01:08:12.671
They say due to financial reasons.

1003
01:08:13.714 --> 01:08:15.341
- Really?

1004
01:08:15.341 --> 01:08:18.761
- Yeah. it's made a lot of people upset.

1005
01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:22.181
but we took up a collection
for him and his wife

1006
01:08:22.181 --> 01:08:25.434
before a lot of people took off.

1007
01:08:25.434 --> 01:08:26.936
- Took off?

1008
01:08:26.936 --> 01:08:28.187
- Yeah. but no.

1009
01:08:28.187 --> 01:08:30.606
a bunch of people thought
this was a huge injustice

1010
01:08:30.606 --> 01:08:32.358
and they left the church.

1011
01:08:32.358 --> 01:08:34.193
Anyway. I just wanted to let you know

1012
01:08:34.193 --> 01:08:37.113
that what happened to you was not right

1013
01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:38.614
and it wasn't your fault.

1014
01:08:38.614 --> 01:08:40.991
It's just. these guys have their ideas

1015
01:08:40.991 --> 01:08:42.368
about how things should be done

1016
01:08:42.368 --> 01:08:44.537
and they don't stray from them.

1017
01:08:44.537 --> 01:08:46.831
- Well. - I appreciate
you letting me know.

1018
01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:49.125
- Well. to be honest.

1019
01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:51.418
we're trying to get better as
a church. but to be honest.

1020
01:08:51.418 --> 01:08:54.338
I feel like the congregation
is in its Twilight stage.

1021
01:08:59.093 --> 01:09:01.470
- You may be more right than you think.

1022
01:09:02.638 --> 01:09:04.723
- Well. don't wish bad things on anyone.

1023
01:09:04.723 --> 01:09:05.933
You're better than that.

1024
01:09:13.315 --> 01:09:14.400
Listen. I got to go.

1025
01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:16.402
It's time for me to start my shopping.

1026
01:09:18.904 --> 01:09:20.531
I'll see you girls on Friday.

1027
01:09:20.531 --> 01:09:21.615
- You bet.

1028
01:09:21.615 --> 01:09:24.451
- All right. love you.
- Love you.

1029
01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:26.704
- All right. bye.

1030
01:09:53.314 --> 01:09:54.648
- I miss you guys too.

1031
01:10:02.323 --> 01:10:04.491
- Can you please be quiet?

1032
01:10:58.754 --> 01:11:01.382
- She's just telling me to stop.

1033
01:11:19.733 --> 01:11:23.070
Watch this. I just learned it yesterday.

1034
01:11:25.823 --> 01:11:27.157
Pretty cool huh?

1035
01:11:31.161 --> 01:11:36.166
It's so hard.

1036
01:12:29.428 --> 01:12:31.930
- Hey. I'm hanging out with
some friends for a little bit.

1037
01:12:31.930 --> 01:12:33.390
- On a school night?

1038
01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:36.352
- I won't be out late.

1039
01:13:44.503 --> 01:13:46.088
- So where do you wanna go?

1040
01:13:46.088 --> 01:13:48.132
- I don't know. wherever you wanna go.

1041
01:13:49.508 --> 01:13:51.552
- I know this cool place.

1042
01:13:51.552 --> 01:13:55.681
- Okay. what kind of place?

1043
01:13:55.681 --> 01:13:58.142
- Just somewhere where we can talk.

1044
01:14:24.543 --> 01:14:25.878
- Do you know him?

1045
01:14:25.878 --> 01:14:28.755
- Yeah. it's a smelly
old hobo begging again.

1046
01:14:28.755 --> 01:14:29.840
I'll take care of him.

1047
01:14:39.057 --> 01:14:40.267
Hey buddy. you hungry?

1048
01:14:41.852 --> 01:14:43.187
- God bless you.

1049
01:14:55.365 --> 01:14:58.494
- Bon apetit buddy.

1050
01:15:02.998 --> 01:15:04.333
- God bless you.

1051
01:15:35.781 --> 01:15:36.823
- Bradley!

1052
01:15:36.823 --> 01:15:38.659
- Hey guys. what's up?

1053
01:15:42.496 --> 01:15:43.580
- This is my girl Kayla.

1054
01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:45.832
- Oh. yes I see you.
- Okay.

1055
01:16:22.619 --> 01:16:24.204
- You feeling okay?

1056
01:16:30.877 --> 01:16:32.546
- What's wrong baby?

1057
01:16:42.764 --> 01:16:43.599
What the?

1058
01:17:07.581 --> 01:17:11.335
- Hey. we were in the neighborhood

1059
01:17:11.335 --> 01:17:13.837
and thought we would give you a lift.

1060
01:17:15.047 --> 01:17:16.798
- Seriously?

1061
01:17:16.798 --> 01:17:19.551
- We're gonna get some
ice cream on the way home.

1062
01:17:23.138 --> 01:17:26.350
We only have one seat
left for one passenger.

1063
01:17:27.517 --> 01:17:29.436
- We could probably squeeze.

1064
01:17:29.436 --> 01:17:34.316
Oh yep. only one seat left. sorry.

1065
01:17:38.612 --> 01:17:40.405
- I'll get you for this later.

1066
01:17:49.831 --> 01:17:51.750
- You'll thank me for this later.

1067
01:17:55.420 --> 01:17:56.254
- I'll text you.

1068
01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:07.432
- You forgot this.

1069
01:18:21.697 --> 01:18:22.948
- One thing that God really put

1070
01:18:22.948 --> 01:18:24.616
on our hearts to talk about tonight

1071
01:18:24.616 --> 01:18:28.370
is division among believers.
division in the church.

1072
01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:31.039
And one thing that Paul talks
about in the New Testament

1073
01:18:31.039 --> 01:18:32.416
is that we'll be recognized

1074
01:18:32.416 --> 01:18:35.919
or identified might be a more
accurate word for our fruit.

1075
01:18:35.919 --> 01:18:37.963
our love for one another.

1076
01:18:37.963 --> 01:18:41.258
- Yeah. even amongst the
strongest of Christians.

1077
01:18:41.258 --> 01:18:45.804
sin can creep in and drive a
wedge in your relationships.

1078
01:18:45.804 --> 01:18:47.222
Now. one thing God has shown me

1079
01:18:47.222 --> 01:18:52.227
is that our minds are so finite.

1080
01:18:52.811 --> 01:18:54.229
that God is so much bigger.

1081
01:18:55.230 --> 01:18:57.816
so much bigger than the
limited circumstances

1082
01:18:57.816 --> 01:19:00.777
that our minds can create
on the path in front of us.

1083
01:19:14.499 --> 01:19:16.460
- Hey Andrea. can I ask you something?

1084
01:19:17.377 --> 01:19:18.628
- Yeah. what's up?

1085
01:19:18.628 --> 01:19:20.714
- I have something I need your advice on.

1086
01:19:20.714 --> 01:19:21.548
- Okay.

1087
01:19:25.969 --> 01:19:26.887
- Are you done?

1088
01:19:26.887 --> 01:19:27.721
- Are you?

1089
01:19:29.181 --> 01:19:31.224
- You are the one that
doesn't know what they want.

1090
01:19:31.224 --> 01:19:32.476
- Are you kidding me?

1091
01:19:32.476 --> 01:19:34.352
- If I was kidding. we wouldn't
be having this conversation.

1092
01:19:34.352 --> 01:19:35.645
- Oh my God.

1093
01:19:42.778 --> 01:19:45.071
- Of me being not participating

1094
01:19:45.071 --> 01:19:46.656
when I'm the one who called you over here

1095
01:19:46.656 --> 01:19:48.366
to actually have this conversation.

1096
01:19:48.366 --> 01:19:50.577
I honestly care about this.

1097
01:19:50.577 --> 01:19:51.661
And you're the one that kind of like.

1098
01:19:51.661 --> 01:19:54.456
you're the one that's always doing this.

1099
01:19:54.456 --> 01:19:55.665
always bringing stuff up.

1100
01:19:55.665 --> 01:19:58.335
You aren't bringing anything up.

1101
01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:30.784
- Bummer.

1102
01:22:02.584 --> 01:22:04.920
- Hey you. just wanted to let you know

1103
01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:06.796
that me and Cami are no more.

1104
01:22:06.796 --> 01:22:08.757
- Oh. goody.

1105
01:22:08.757 --> 01:22:11.259
- Yeah. she just wasn't for me.

1106
01:22:11.259 --> 01:22:14.054
- And let me guess. I am?

1107
01:22:14.054 --> 01:22:18.224
- Well. I mean maybe-
- Save it.

1108
01:22:18.224 --> 01:22:20.185
I'm gonna save you from the embarrassment

1109
01:22:20.185 --> 01:22:22.062
of making a fool of yourself.

1110
01:22:22.062 --> 01:22:24.731
I'm not even remotely
interested in you at all.

1111
01:22:37.452 --> 01:22:39.329
- But you don't even know me.

1112
01:22:39.329 --> 01:22:42.165
- Well. I would say in a
way I know you quite well.

1113
01:22:42.165 --> 01:22:44.960
certainly better than
Cami ever did. excuse me.

1114
01:22:49.297 --> 01:22:50.173
- Busted .

1115
01:23:28.253 --> 01:23:31.840
- Oh. wonderful. if you're
here to gloat don't. okay.

1116
01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:34.009
Today's not the day to mess with me.

1117
01:23:34.009 --> 01:23:37.095
- No. I just wanted to
come and say I'm sorry

1118
01:23:37.971 --> 01:23:40.598
and that you deserve much better.

1119
01:23:40.598 --> 01:23:41.891
- Don't mess with me.

1120
01:23:41.891 --> 01:23:46.062
- No seriously. think about all
the ways you've been acting.

1121
01:23:46.062 --> 01:23:50.859
trying to hold onto someone
that isn't the best for you.

1122
01:23:51.693 --> 01:23:54.779
And I think you knew it deep down inside.

1123
01:23:54.779 --> 01:23:57.032
that's why you were holding on so tight

1124
01:23:57.032 --> 01:23:59.784
and it almost made you a
whole different person.

1125
01:23:59.784 --> 01:24:02.954
- You don't know anything about
me or who I am as a person.

1126
01:24:02.954 --> 01:24:05.498
- I know what a head
over heels girl in love

1127
01:24:05.498 --> 01:24:07.042
with the wrong man looks like.

1128
01:24:08.376 --> 01:24:10.879
My sisters are going through it now

1129
01:24:10.879 --> 01:24:13.048
and I'm gonna be patient with them.

1130
01:24:14.007 --> 01:24:16.926
There was a time when I was so obsessed

1131
01:24:16.926 --> 01:24:18.887
with someone I wanted to be with.

1132
01:24:18.887 --> 01:24:21.264
I was so infatuated with him

1133
01:24:21.264 --> 01:24:24.100
that I couldn't see
myself not being with him.

1134
01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:26.478
but God had other plans

1135
01:24:26.478 --> 01:24:29.022
and He showed me how miserable
my life would have been

1136
01:24:29.022 --> 01:24:31.149
with someone who seemed to look good

1137
01:24:31.149 --> 01:24:33.026
and seemed to be the best for me.

1138
01:24:33.026 --> 01:24:35.445
But in reality. I just didn't have a clear

1139
01:24:35.445 --> 01:24:37.280
and raw picture of my life.

1140
01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:39.449
Just like they talked
about at Bible study.

1141
01:24:40.784 --> 01:24:42.535
- I almost don't even care anymore.

1142
01:24:44.788 --> 01:24:47.957
What's an amazing Godly man
gonna wanna do with me now.

1143
01:24:47.957 --> 01:24:49.417
my sins and flaws and all?

1144
01:24:51.044 --> 01:24:54.339
- Yeah. I used to think that way too.

1145
01:24:54.339 --> 01:24:57.217
I was so obsessed with what
I thought was realistic.

1146
01:24:57.217 --> 01:24:59.427
I left no room for faith.

1147
01:24:59.427 --> 01:25:03.098
I realized if you're
genuinely pursuing God.

1148
01:25:03.098 --> 01:25:04.057
then at that point.

1149
01:25:04.057 --> 01:25:06.392
you really have no
excuse to not trust Him.

1150
01:25:07.811 --> 01:25:11.523
- What if God wants me to be
single for the rest of my life?

1151
01:25:11.523 --> 01:25:14.526
- I may not be mature
enough to bring my 2 cents.

1152
01:25:14.526 --> 01:25:17.445
but we live in a world where
we blame everything on God.

1153
01:25:17.445 --> 01:25:20.448
our failures. the devil's schemes.

1154
01:25:20.448 --> 01:25:22.951
If you were to be single
for the rest of your life.

1155
01:25:22.951 --> 01:25:25.245
it's not because God
didn't bring you anybody.

1156
01:25:26.079 --> 01:25:27.038
In the Bible. it says.

1157
01:25:27.038 --> 01:25:29.415
"Delight yourself in the Lord
and He'll give you the desires

1158
01:25:29.415 --> 01:25:30.667
"of your heart."

1159
01:25:30.667 --> 01:25:32.669
So if it's your desire to get married.

1160
01:25:32.669 --> 01:25:34.587
ask God and pursue it.

1161
01:25:34.587 --> 01:25:35.797
That's just my thoughts.

1162
01:25:37.048 --> 01:25:41.219
- You're right. that makes
perfect sense. thank you.

1163
01:25:41.219 --> 01:25:44.139
I guess I was just so obsessed with him

1164
01:25:44.139 --> 01:25:46.182
that I lost who I was along the way.

1165
01:25:47.183 --> 01:25:48.560
It's not me.

1166
01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:51.062
Listen. I'm so sorry about the
way I've acted in the past.

1167
01:25:51.062 --> 01:25:53.148
It's not who I am.

1168
01:25:53.148 --> 01:25:53.982
I was just obsessed with him

1169
01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:56.067
that I kind of lost myself along the way.

1170
01:25:56.067 --> 01:25:58.862
I've been a completely different person.

1171
01:25:58.862 --> 01:26:02.073
- Friends?
- Friends.

1172
01:26:17.755 --> 01:26:20.758
- So how has the new school been?

1173
01:26:20.758 --> 01:26:23.052
- It's awesome. I get free coffee.

1174
01:26:23.052 --> 01:26:26.681
get to skip class and get to
talk about my life all day.

1175
01:26:26.681 --> 01:26:28.308
It's pretty great.

1176
01:26:28.308 --> 01:26:29.893
- Wow.

1177
01:26:29.893 --> 01:26:32.562
- That's coming to a close very soon.

1178
01:26:32.562 --> 01:26:33.563
- For real?

1179
01:26:35.315 --> 01:26:36.149
Fine.

1180
01:26:37.233 --> 01:26:39.194
- Oh. the drama.

1181
01:26:39.194 --> 01:26:41.571
- It's definitely been
a wild semester so far.

1182
01:26:42.906 --> 01:26:46.701
- Well. I definitely
wanna hear all about it.

1183
01:26:46.701 --> 01:26:47.535
Are you girls done?

1184
01:26:47.535 --> 01:26:48.870
You look like you're done.

1185
01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:50.788
- Yeah. I am.
- Me too.

1186
01:26:50.788 --> 01:26:53.208
- I mean. I could always
go for more .

1187
01:26:54.250 --> 01:26:55.627
- Pig.

1188
01:26:55.627 --> 01:26:56.961
- Go ahead and enjoy some more.

1189
01:26:56.961 --> 01:26:58.379
Clean up when you're done.

1190
01:26:58.379 --> 01:26:59.839
Your aunt and I need to talk.

1191
01:27:01.216 --> 01:27:02.467
- Ooh. that sounds serious.

1192
01:27:02.467 --> 01:27:03.301
Wait a second.

1193
01:27:03.301 --> 01:27:06.221
does that mean that they're
gonna clean up in my kitchen?

1194
01:27:07.263 --> 01:27:09.349
This is great.

1195
01:27:09.349 --> 01:27:12.393
You girls growing up is
definitely to my benefit.

1196
01:27:12.393 --> 01:27:13.228
Does this mean

1197
01:27:13.228 --> 01:27:15.063
I don't get them Christmas
presents this year?

1198
01:27:15.063 --> 01:27:16.231
- No. what?
- What?

1199
01:27:16.231 --> 01:27:17.398
- No. no.
- No.

1200
01:27:20.777 --> 01:27:23.279
- No. no. no. no. no. no.

1201
01:27:23.279 --> 01:27:24.948
- No. I'm kidding.

1202
01:27:24.948 --> 01:27:26.574
I already bought you presents.

1203
01:27:26.574 --> 01:27:27.408
Are you kidding me.

1204
01:27:27.408 --> 01:27:29.661
You gotta wait for them.

1205
01:27:29.661 --> 01:27:31.829
Okay. this is big tonight.

1206
01:27:51.849 --> 01:27:53.935
- So do you always have to decorate

1207
01:27:53.935 --> 01:27:55.687
for Christmas before Thanksgiving?

1208
01:27:55.687 --> 01:27:57.897
- Yes. I do always have to decorate

1209
01:27:57.897 --> 01:28:00.316
for Christmas before Thanksgiving.

1210
01:28:02.944 --> 01:28:03.778
- Put your foot down.

1211
01:28:03.778 --> 01:28:05.154
- Why are you all up in my business?

1212
01:28:05.154 --> 01:28:06.948
- Because I'm always up in your business.

1213
01:28:06.948 --> 01:28:10.034
- Oh. well. you know I'm about to get up

1214
01:28:10.034 --> 01:28:12.036
in your business too.

1215
01:28:12.036 --> 01:28:14.330
Are you gonna go to church
with the girls on Sunday?

1216
01:28:14.330 --> 01:28:16.207
- I'm just still trying

1217
01:28:16.207 --> 01:28:18.042
to debate whether I should go or not.

1218
01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:20.044
- So why?

1219
01:28:21.713 --> 01:28:23.089
- Well. I'm glad they're going.

1220
01:28:23.089 --> 01:28:26.259
but I just feel like it's too late for me.

1221
01:28:27.802 --> 01:28:29.429
They don't need a divorced woman

1222
01:28:29.429 --> 01:28:32.056
at the church justified or unjustified.

1223
01:28:34.851 --> 01:28:39.439
- I talked to Ralph and Yvette
at small group on Wednesday

1224
01:28:39.439 --> 01:28:43.026
and I feel like they're both
the starting to understand

1225
01:28:43.026 --> 01:28:44.777
and see what's happening to us.

1226
01:28:44.777 --> 01:28:46.654
I even pulled Yvette aside and I'm like.

1227
01:28:46.654 --> 01:28:47.780
"What have we become?"

1228
01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:49.574
It just seems like ever
since that incident

1229
01:28:49.574 --> 01:28:50.950
with a youth pastor.

1230
01:28:50.950 --> 01:28:54.078
we've been making more
and more rash decisions

1231
01:28:54.078 --> 01:28:54.912
in the church

1232
01:28:54.912 --> 01:28:58.082
and it is causing a lot of division.

1233
01:28:58.082 --> 01:29:00.126
And I just say all that to say. I mean.

1234
01:29:00.126 --> 01:29:03.296
God is your ultimate authority.
not the church leadership.

1235
01:29:03.296 --> 01:29:05.089
not your boss at work.

1236
01:29:05.089 --> 01:29:07.800
And if you know that
you're right with God.

1237
01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:10.470
it gives you the ability to forgive people

1238
01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:13.264
who are just being dumb humans.

1239
01:29:14.223 --> 01:29:17.435
Can only see things from
their own perspective.

1240
01:29:17.435 --> 01:29:20.313
and they're not 100% right about anything.

1241
01:29:22.231 --> 01:29:25.151
Even when I told you about what
happened with Pastor Smith.

1242
01:29:28.321 --> 01:29:29.864
whatever it is that our
church is dealing with.

1243
01:29:29.864 --> 01:29:33.159
whether it's weakened leadership
or people are overreacting

1244
01:29:33.159 --> 01:29:35.119
because of past experiences.

1245
01:29:35.119 --> 01:29:38.664
And it doesn't change God's
love or affection for you.

1246
01:29:38.664 --> 01:29:41.709
but I feel like deep down.
maybe you feel like it does.

1247
01:29:41.709 --> 01:29:43.961
- But. what about what they said?

1248
01:29:43.961 --> 01:29:44.921
Like I'm not fighting

1249
01:29:44.921 --> 01:29:46.839
for my marriage like it's all my fault?

1250
01:29:48.091 --> 01:29:53.096
- Well. I mean. I grew up with
you and I think we both know

1251
01:29:53.638 --> 01:29:57.183
that you are perfectly capable of fighting

1252
01:29:57.183 --> 01:29:59.102
and I don't even remember one instance

1253
01:29:59.102 --> 01:30:00.228
when you were wrong.

1254
01:30:01.354 --> 01:30:05.274
- Okay. yeah. yeah.

1255
01:30:07.568 --> 01:30:09.028
- And has anything ever been your fault?

1256
01:30:09.028 --> 01:30:11.406
No. nothing has ever been your fault.

1257
01:30:13.366 --> 01:30:16.744
Oh come on. I mean. you
know what I felt about Bill?

1258
01:30:16.744 --> 01:30:18.246
I mean. I know you were sick of his lies.

1259
01:30:18.246 --> 01:30:19.747
I was sick of his lies.

1260
01:30:20.623 --> 01:30:24.210
I mean. it's not fair what he
did to you. church did to you.

1261
01:30:24.210 --> 01:30:26.003
I mean. it's not fair that you have

1262
01:30:26.003 --> 01:30:28.589
to go through a divorce
without your church family.

1263
01:30:28.589 --> 01:30:31.551
or start over again in a new town.

1264
01:30:31.551 --> 01:30:34.804
a new job. the new school for the girls.

1265
01:30:37.598 --> 01:30:40.017
just all of it. single parenting.

1266
01:30:40.017 --> 01:30:42.812
But it does remind me of
what mom always used to say.

1267
01:30:42.812 --> 01:30:47.150
She said. "Pray for a
spirit of unselfishness

1268
01:30:48.109 --> 01:30:50.611
"even if you don't feel
like you've been selfish."

1269
01:30:58.494 --> 01:31:00.329
What?

1270
01:31:00.329 --> 01:31:02.832
- Well. you know about my new company.

1271
01:31:02.832 --> 01:31:05.960
how we buy. sell land. property venues?

1272
01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:07.044
- Right.

1273
01:31:07.044 --> 01:31:10.047
- Well. somehow our company
started to do business

1274
01:31:10.047 --> 01:31:11.757
with the owner of the plot of land

1275
01:31:11.757 --> 01:31:15.052
that owns some businesses.
including the church.

1276
01:31:16.179 --> 01:31:19.640
So I requested for that
building to be torn down

1277
01:31:20.975 --> 01:31:24.395
and the document just came in this week

1278
01:31:24.395 --> 01:31:26.731
and all it needs is my signature.

1279
01:31:29.317 --> 01:31:32.069
- Okay well. please tell me
that you did not sign that.

1280
01:31:57.637 --> 01:32:02.642
- No. instead I signed
a check for a donation

1281
01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:05.186
to Pastor Smith

1282
01:32:05.186 --> 01:32:06.771
and I set that document aside.

1283
01:32:06.771 --> 01:32:08.564
maybe to think about it for later.

1284
01:32:08.564 --> 01:32:11.984
- Okay well. please just tell
me you're gonna tear it up

1285
01:32:11.984 --> 01:32:13.277
and throw it away.

1286
01:32:14.612 --> 01:32:18.032
- Yes I am.
- Okay. good.

1287
01:32:20.243 --> 01:32:23.079
I mean. you just have to pray
for a way to move past this.

1288
01:32:23.079 --> 01:32:24.956
I mean. the girls need you.

1289
01:32:24.956 --> 01:32:28.042
I can tell Kayla. she has
some abandonment issues.

1290
01:32:28.042 --> 01:32:29.544
I know she's getting some
help from the church.

1291
01:32:29.544 --> 01:32:31.837
but still. it's still affecting them.

1292
01:32:31.837 --> 01:32:36.467
It's affecting all of them
and you and me. mostly me.

1293
01:32:36.467 --> 01:32:38.719
- Yes.
- And that's what matters.

1294
01:32:41.389 --> 01:32:42.932
Oh yeah. that in itself is just a thing.

1295
01:32:42.932 --> 01:32:46.269
Whatever. I always forget about that.

1296
01:32:46.269 --> 01:32:48.104
I love you sis.
- I love you too.

1297
01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:51.440
Thank you.
- Oh. thank you.

1298
01:33:15.089 --> 01:33:17.008
- Are you still talking to him?

1299
01:33:19.468 --> 01:33:20.970
- What makes you think you have the right

1300
01:33:20.970 --> 01:33:23.389
to constantly be in my business?

1301
01:33:23.389 --> 01:33:26.726
- I've been your best
friend all your life.

1302
01:33:26.726 --> 01:33:30.187
I've always been up in your
business and you in mine.

1303
01:33:30.187 --> 01:33:32.356
What's so different about now?

1304
01:33:32.356 --> 01:33:34.317
- I just wanna make my own decisions

1305
01:33:34.317 --> 01:33:37.445
and stop being treated like
I'm some dumb little girl

1306
01:33:37.445 --> 01:33:39.322
that doesn't know what's best for her.

1307
01:33:43.701 --> 01:33:46.704
- You know just as well as I do.

1308
01:33:46.704 --> 01:33:50.750
people our age don't make good
decisions without guidance.

1309
01:33:50.750 --> 01:33:52.335
Let's face it.

1310
01:33:52.335 --> 01:33:55.254
neither of us have been
the same since dad left.

1311
01:33:56.255 --> 01:33:59.759
Shoot. the only one that's
been normal is Caitlyn.

1312
01:34:02.970 --> 01:34:04.680
- Caitlyn doesn't count.

1313
01:34:05.556 --> 01:34:09.852
I mean. look at her.
everything's a joke to her.

1314
01:34:09.852 --> 01:34:13.189
Just like the counselor
says. she's suppressing it.

1315
01:34:14.357 --> 01:34:18.986
- Maybe she just chooses joy
over dwelling and sadness.

1316
01:34:21.697 --> 01:34:25.409
You can make the choice to let
your experiences define you.

1317
01:34:25.409 --> 01:34:28.496
You can choose to believe
that all your new friends

1318
01:34:28.496 --> 01:34:31.624
from church are gonna one day leave you

1319
01:34:31.624 --> 01:34:35.544
or you can trust that God will
bring people into your life.

1320
01:34:35.544 --> 01:34:38.714
some permanent and some for a season

1321
01:34:38.714 --> 01:34:41.050
and it's your job not to run them off.

1322
01:34:42.968 --> 01:34:45.846
- You can't trust anyone to stay.

1323
01:34:45.846 --> 01:34:46.681
- Yes. you can.

1324
01:34:52.770 --> 01:34:56.524
Kayla. just just know that God is there

1325
01:34:56.524 --> 01:34:58.609
even when others cannot be.

1326
01:34:58.609 --> 01:35:01.862
Just concentrate on you there for others.

1327
01:35:01.862 --> 01:35:04.824
Think about it. are you perfect?

1328
01:35:04.824 --> 01:35:06.659
Do you care for Cami at school?

1329
01:35:06.659 --> 01:35:07.952
- What?

1330
01:35:07.952 --> 01:35:09.578
No way.

1331
01:35:09.578 --> 01:35:11.622
- She's a friend of mine now.

1332
01:35:13.082 --> 01:35:14.458
Very much so.

1333
01:35:15.501 --> 01:35:17.712
I'll explain later.

1334
01:35:17.712 --> 01:35:18.629
- What happened?

1335
01:35:21.465 --> 01:35:26.011
- Braiden broke up with her
and I took the chance to...

1336
01:35:28.848 --> 01:35:31.726
- What?
- Show her compassion.

1337
01:35:31.726 --> 01:35:34.228
That's all I felt for her was compassion.

1338
01:35:35.062 --> 01:35:38.065
I prayed that God would help
me see her through His eyes.

1339
01:35:41.569 --> 01:35:42.361
- Was it hard?

1340
01:35:43.446 --> 01:35:45.364
- It was until I prayed that prayer.

1341
01:36:12.683 --> 01:36:16.604
- Dear God. why am I doing this to myself?

1342
01:36:17.563 --> 01:36:22.568
You've always been so faithful
to me. but out of my anger.

1343
01:36:22.735 --> 01:36:24.487
I've turned my back on You.

1344
01:36:26.530 --> 01:36:29.366
I'm sorry. please forgive me

1345
01:36:29.366 --> 01:36:31.327
for all the wrong decisions I have made

1346
01:36:32.411 --> 01:36:33.788
that has led me to sin.

1347
01:36:35.289 --> 01:36:37.875
Heal my heart and help me to trust You

1348
01:36:38.959 --> 01:36:40.711
and get me back on the path that leads

1349
01:36:40.711 --> 01:36:44.548
to life. righteousness and joy

1350
01:36:45.758 --> 01:36:48.052
that I know only truly comes from You.

1351
01:36:49.595 --> 01:36:51.305
Help me to love my family

1352
01:36:54.558 --> 01:36:57.102
and thank You for my sisters and my mom.

1353
01:36:58.521 --> 01:37:01.482
And just help me to love
and appreciate them.

1354
01:37:03.442 --> 01:37:06.153
I know I haven't been the
easiest person to be around.

1355
01:37:07.154 --> 01:37:09.824
but help me to change that.

1356
01:37:11.909 --> 01:37:13.035
Heal me Lord.

1357
01:37:23.671 --> 01:37:27.591
I'm sorry I've been so rude
and impossible to deal with.

1358
01:37:29.552 --> 01:37:31.095
- We knew you'd come around.

1359
01:37:32.388 --> 01:37:34.431
- It's been hard on all of us.

1360
01:37:34.431 --> 01:37:35.474
We love you.

1361
01:37:35.474 --> 01:37:37.393
And you know God will see us through.

1362
01:38:34.575 --> 01:38:36.076
- Whose flowers are these?

1363
01:38:36.076 --> 01:38:38.621
Girls. who got these flowers?

1364
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:40.706
- I did. mom.

1365
01:38:43.792 --> 01:38:44.919
- Why?

1366
01:38:44.919 --> 01:38:48.088
They're beautiful. my
favorite. pink roses.

1367
01:38:48.088 --> 01:38:49.632
But why did you get them?

1368
01:38:49.632 --> 01:38:52.259
- Because you've always been there for me.

1369
01:38:52.259 --> 01:38:53.969
You're the strongest person I know.

1370
01:38:56.138 --> 01:38:58.182
- You are an awesome daughter.

1371
01:39:00.684 --> 01:39:01.644
Thank you Megan.

1372
01:39:03.312 --> 01:39:04.563
I love you.

1373
01:39:04.563 --> 01:39:05.689
- I love you too.

1374
01:39:05.689 --> 01:39:07.816
- And you've always been there for me too.

1375
01:39:24.458 --> 01:39:28.253
- Kayla. didn't think we'd forget you

1376
01:39:28.253 --> 01:39:30.255
on your special day did you Miss. Kayla?

1377
01:39:32.424 --> 01:39:33.258
- We're taking you out to dinner.

1378
01:39:33.258 --> 01:39:34.385
You can't say no.

1379
01:39:34.385 --> 01:39:36.261
- Oh. I know just the place.

1380
01:39:38.639 --> 01:39:40.599
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you. wow.

1381
01:39:41.934 --> 01:39:44.019
- Oh. look at that?

1382
01:39:44.019 --> 01:39:45.896
That is so sweet.

1383
01:39:45.896 --> 01:39:47.523
Do you think they'd
mind if I took a video?

1384
01:39:47.523 --> 01:39:49.233
Just the creepy aunt in the background?

1385
01:39:49.233 --> 01:39:52.277
- Not at all.
- Of the sweet moment.

1386
01:39:52.277 --> 01:39:54.405
- It's so good to see Kayla happy.

1387
01:39:54.405 --> 01:39:58.242
- Oh. it's precious. love it.

1388
01:40:00.494 --> 01:40:03.414
- Well. I have the check

1389
01:40:03.414 --> 01:40:05.916
to give to you to give to
Pastor Smith at your church.

1390
01:40:05.916 --> 01:40:07.209
- Well. you know what?

1391
01:40:07.209 --> 01:40:09.837
I am having dinner with
him and his wife tonight.

1392
01:40:09.837 --> 01:40:13.090
Do you wanna join us?
- Okay. we'll be there.

1393
01:40:13.090 --> 01:40:14.133
- Awesome.

1394
01:40:24.268 --> 01:40:26.311
- Well. we regret not having a chance

1395
01:40:26.311 --> 01:40:29.023
to really get to know you
better while we were there.

1396
01:40:29.023 --> 01:40:32.860
but just this whole experience.
it's taken us by storm.

1397
01:40:33.736 --> 01:40:34.570
- It sure has.

1398
01:40:34.570 --> 01:40:37.448
- But. I accepted a new position down.

1399
01:40:37.448 --> 01:40:41.326
what. a couple of hours
South of here to a new church

1400
01:40:41.326 --> 01:40:43.787
so all is well with us.

1401
01:40:43.787 --> 01:40:48.751
Just wish God would have
chose a less dramatic way

1402
01:40:49.168 --> 01:40:50.502
of moving us on .

1403
01:40:52.171 --> 01:40:53.297
- We all do.

1404
01:40:55.382 --> 01:40:59.344
- But we have learned so much
through this whole experience.

1405
01:40:59.344 --> 01:41:01.055
I mean. we sure have.

1406
01:41:01.055 --> 01:41:02.806
- Oh. so have we.

1407
01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:07.811
- Really. tell us about it?

1408
01:41:07.811 --> 01:41:09.104
- I've been through a lot.

1409
01:41:09.980 --> 01:41:12.941
When my husband left me. it crushed me.

1410
01:41:12.941 --> 01:41:14.651
I mean. really crushed me.

1411
01:41:15.569 --> 01:41:18.238
And the hardest part was
that the church didn't help.

1412
01:41:19.239 --> 01:41:21.033
I just needed someone to be there for me

1413
01:41:21.033 --> 01:41:22.117
and to encourage me.

1414
01:41:24.369 --> 01:41:26.622
I just needed to be strong for my kids.

1415
01:41:28.665 --> 01:41:30.209
Wanna know how I did it?

1416
01:41:30.209 --> 01:41:31.043
- Absolutely.

1417
01:41:31.043 --> 01:41:32.795
- Oh. we really wanna hear it. yes.

1418
01:41:35.047 --> 01:41:37.591
- With the help of
someone very close to me

1419
01:41:37.591 --> 01:41:39.676
who helped me push past my pain.

1420
01:41:42.304 --> 01:41:44.598
I started to just abide in the Lord.

1421
01:41:44.598 --> 01:41:47.309
I started to press into the
Lord and spend time alone

1422
01:41:47.309 --> 01:41:49.186
with Him and reading His word.

1423
01:41:49.186 --> 01:41:52.981
The Lord minister to me
personally in my quiet time

1424
01:41:52.981 --> 01:41:56.360
and let me realize He was still in control

1425
01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:58.612
even in the midst of my loneliness.

1426
01:41:59.655 --> 01:42:01.448
And you know what I found out?

1427
01:42:01.448 --> 01:42:03.367
God did not forsake me.

1428
01:42:05.369 --> 01:42:08.497
When the church shunned
me. that wasn't God.

1429
01:42:08.497 --> 01:42:12.000
that was just fallen people
blinded by their own opinions.

1430
01:42:13.168 --> 01:42:17.714
But God. He accepted me. and He loved me.

1431
01:42:19.925 --> 01:42:24.930
and He forgave me and He
encouraged me to get back up again.

1432
01:42:24.930 --> 01:42:27.599
That is the power of Jesus.

1433
01:42:27.599 --> 01:42:28.767
- Amen.
- Amen.

1434
01:42:30.644 --> 01:42:34.398
- I'm so sorry you went through all that.

1435
01:42:34.398 --> 01:42:36.108
- We didn't realize all that was happening

1436
01:42:36.108 --> 01:42:40.028
to you at our church. but
I praise God that the Lord.

1437
01:42:40.028 --> 01:42:41.363
He's been ministering

1438
01:42:41.363 --> 01:42:44.241
to you the same way He's
been ministering to us.

1439
01:43:12.811 --> 01:43:14.813
- Hey there. I'm Kyle.

1440
01:43:14.813 --> 01:43:16.440
I'm Pastor Harold's son.

1441
01:43:25.616 --> 01:43:27.868
I hear you used to go to our church.

1442
01:43:27.868 --> 01:43:30.078
How have we not met before?

1443
01:43:30.078 --> 01:43:30.913
- I don't know.

1444
01:43:37.544 --> 01:43:39.379
- Okay. time to go.

1445
01:43:39.379 --> 01:43:42.257
- Yup. got some more gifts to open.

1446
01:43:42.257 --> 01:43:46.762
- Caitlyn. Kayla where do
you think you guys are going?

1447
01:43:46.762 --> 01:43:48.388
I'm talking to you.

1448
01:43:49.765 --> 01:43:50.974
Come back here.

1449
01:43:52.017 --> 01:43:53.018
Guys. I'm serious.

1450
01:43:54.436 --> 01:43:55.771
- You'll thank me later.

1451
01:43:55.771 --> 01:43:57.397
- Oh my gosh.

1452
01:43:57.397 --> 01:43:59.233
Oh. no you were not.

1453
01:44:01.860 --> 01:44:03.528
Hi. I'm Megan.

1454
01:44:05.197 --> 01:44:06.031
- Hi.

1455
01:44:10.661 --> 01:44:11.495
- All right everybody.

1456
01:44:11.495 --> 01:44:14.289
it's time for Kayla to give
her birthday speech tonight.

1457
01:44:16.333 --> 01:44:20.045
- Speech. speech. speech. speech. speech.

1458
01:44:20.045 --> 01:44:22.965
- Speech.
speech. speech. speech.

1459
01:44:22.965 --> 01:44:25.550
speech. speech. speech. speech.

1460
01:44:28.762 --> 01:44:29.721
- Okay. okay. okay.

1461
01:44:31.306 --> 01:44:35.352
Well. thank you all for
coming and for the presents.

1462
01:44:35.352 --> 01:44:40.357
And thank you for just being there for me.

1463
01:44:43.944 --> 01:44:44.903
As most of you know.

1464
01:44:44.903 --> 01:44:46.738
I'm going through a really hard time.

1465
01:44:49.741 --> 01:44:51.535
I appreciate how supportive

1466
01:44:51.535 --> 01:44:53.495
and accepting you've all been to me.

1467
01:44:55.580 --> 01:44:57.249
It means more to me than you know.

1468
01:44:59.209 --> 01:45:02.337
God is healing me and He's
showing me how faithful He is.

1469
01:45:04.131 --> 01:45:06.550
This has been an amazing evening.

1470
01:45:07.551 --> 01:45:10.178
Your encouragement has showed me

1471
01:45:10.178 --> 01:45:14.308
that even when you're hurting.
God can give you hope again.

1472
01:45:20.230 --> 01:45:22.107
Now let's see some cake!

1473
01:46:57.702 --> 01:46:59.329
- You can do a little turn maybe?
