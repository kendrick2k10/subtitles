3
00:00:48.542 --> 00:00:49.667
‐ Hi there.

4
00:00:49.667 --> 00:00:51.375
My name is Marcus Lund.
and you are listening

5
00:00:51.375 --> 00:00:52.917
to The Ultimate Playlist of Noise.

6
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.083
I hope you can hear me.

7
00:00:56.542 --> 00:00:57.917
because I definitely cannot.

8
00:01:04.583 --> 00:01:06.875
I'm sharing the past few months
of my life with you.

9
00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:11.167
which I think can only be described
as "extraordinarily formative."

10
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.833
Darling don't you go
and cut your hair

11
00:01:14.833 --> 00:01:17.208
WOMAN:
Hey. you're gonna miss the bus.

12
00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:21.792
I said‐‐

13
00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:25.542
I said. "You're gonna miss the bus."

14
00:01:26.208 --> 00:01:27.708
This is absurd.

15
00:01:28.167 --> 00:01:30.792
‐ Why? One's for music.
and one's for ambiance.

16
00:01:30.792 --> 00:01:33.083
Look. What if you want
to listen to Neil Young

17
00:01:33.083 --> 00:01:36.333
while roasting marshmallows
in the Smoky Mountains?

18
00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:38.625
‐ Uh. what are the chances of listening
to Cat's in the Cradle

19
00:01:38.625 --> 00:01:41.167
while you give a valedictorian speech?

20
00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:43.708
‐ Well. I have a 2.8 GPA.
so you do the math.

21
00:01:43.708 --> 00:01:46.458
Math. Ugh. no thank you.

22
00:01:46.458 --> 00:01:48.167
‐ Yeah. Now you see my problem.

23
00:01:52.042 --> 00:01:53.417
MARCUS:
Look. I know what you're thinking:

24
00:01:53.417 --> 00:01:55.292
is wearing two pairs
of headphones overkill?

25
00:01:55.292 --> 00:01:57.750
Yes. Do I care? No.

26
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.708
My town has won America's Safest Suburb
12 years in a row.

27
00:02:00.708 --> 00:02:03.167
The only notable landmark is
the Chili's where Obama ate.

28
00:02:03.167 --> 00:02:04.708
I think he got mozzarella sticks.

29
00:02:04.708 --> 00:02:06.500
I don't know.
there's a picture on the wall.

30
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.125
The point is sound is my escape
into something bigger than myself.

31
00:02:10.125 --> 00:02:12.917
Some people play video games.
some watch movies.

32
00:02:12.917 --> 00:02:15.958
I listen to Sonic Youth while pretending
I'm walking through a thunderstorm.

33
00:02:18.208 --> 00:02:19.875
‐ Where is it? Come on!

34
00:02:20.375 --> 00:02:22.792
MARCUS: Other than that.
I'm just your average teenager.

35
00:02:22.792 --> 00:02:25.583
acne. mood swings. weird elbows.

36
00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:32.958
You guys ready for Sharkitecture tomorrow?

37
00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.417
‐ Oh my God. I'm so excited.

38
00:02:34.417 --> 00:02:38.458
‐ Hey. if I buy you pizza after.
will you help me crowdsurf?

39
00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:40.083
‐ You have that much faith
in my upper body strength?

40
00:02:40.083 --> 00:02:42.792
‐ No. but I am a risk taker.

41
00:02:45.542 --> 00:02:46.833
Get ready.

42
00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:47.958
‐ Your coccyx bone.

43
00:02:48.458 --> 00:02:50.000
If you were to describe me
to a police officer.

44
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.625
you'd probably say something like

45
00:02:51.625 --> 00:02:53.458
"that kid with the ugly‐ass scar
on his back."

46
00:02:56.833 --> 00:02:59.083
When I was a kid.
our house caught fire.

47
00:03:04.208 --> 00:03:05.958
My older brother Alex rescued me.

48
00:03:15.125 --> 00:03:16.375
He didn't survive.

49
00:03:18.833 --> 00:03:22.208
Everything I do. I do for Alex.

50
00:03:22.208 --> 00:03:25.375
I wear his headphones.
Use his tape recorder.

51
00:03:26.625 --> 00:03:27.958
And listen to his music.

52
00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:30.750
All of his music.

53
00:03:33.875 --> 00:03:36.208
Especially Sylvie Scar.

54
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.417
It's sort of made me the resident
"playlist doctor" at my school.

55
00:03:48.542 --> 00:03:49.708
‐ It's tomorrow. right?

56
00:03:50.375 --> 00:03:51.417
All right.

57
00:03:51.417 --> 00:03:53.583
"The Ultimate Playlist of Third Dates."

58
00:03:53.583 --> 00:03:55.375
Begins and ends with D'Angelo.

59
00:03:55.375 --> 00:03:58.792
Here's "The Ultimate Playlist
of Suburban Acid Trips."

60
00:03:58.792 --> 00:04:01.500
So we have Animal Collective for the rise.

61
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.250
Brian Eno for the fall.

62
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.083
and Belle and Sebastian
in case you hallucinate

63
00:04:06.083 --> 00:04:07.458
your face is lasagna again.

64
00:04:07.875 --> 00:04:10.500
"The Ultimate Playlist
of Getting Mr. Denver's Attention."

65
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.917
WOMAN: Conway Twitty?

66
00:04:17.792 --> 00:04:19.458
‐ So about that C‐minus?

67
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.917
All right. I need a closer
for "The Ultimate Playlist

68
00:04:22.917 --> 00:04:24.958
of Facebook Stalking Your Ex At Three AM."

69
00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.292
Any suggestions?
‐ Oh. Pig Destroyer.

70
00:04:27.875 --> 00:04:30.417
‐ Yeah. it's a strong choice.

71
00:04:30.417 --> 00:04:32.500
‐ You're making this playlist
for yourself?

72
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.292
‐ No. some kid who got dumped
at Homecoming.

73
00:04:34.292 --> 00:04:36.417
‐ Ah!
I wondered why you were making a playlist

74
00:04:36.417 --> 00:04:38.250
for an ex when you've
never had a girlfriend?

75
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.750
LAURA:
Dude...

76
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.625
you just got roasted by your mom.

77
00:04:41.625 --> 00:04:43.083
‐ Shut up.
‐ I'm sorry.

78
00:04:43.083 --> 00:04:44.333
‐ No. it's fine. Thank you.

79
00:04:44.333 --> 00:04:45.958
Guys. are you almost ready?

80
00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.542
DOMINIC: Wait. Hold on.

81
00:04:47.542 --> 00:04:50.042
‐ Dad. what are you looking for?

82
00:04:50.042 --> 00:04:51.542
DOMINIC:
Hold on. Ha ha! Got it!

83
00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:56.542
All right. Me and Sylvie Scar
at The Pyramid.

84
00:04:56.542 --> 00:04:58.292
1979.

85
00:04:58.292 --> 00:05:00.083
MARCUS: What?
DOMINIC: Yeah. before she was big.

86
00:05:00.083 --> 00:05:01.875
SARAH: Whoa!
‐ Nice. Mr. Lund.

87
00:05:01.875 --> 00:05:03.208
‐ Holy shit. Dad.

88
00:05:03.208 --> 00:05:05.417
Why didn't you tell me
you used to be cool?

89
00:05:05.417 --> 00:05:07.500
Hey. we should get a picture
with Sharkitecture after the show!

90
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.917
‐ As long as you're home by ten.

91
00:05:09.417 --> 00:05:12.167
‐ Wh‐‐ Mom. the show ends at ten.
What if there's an encore?

92
00:05:12.167 --> 00:05:13.792
‐ Then the encore
had better be done by ten.

93
00:05:13.792 --> 00:05:15.458
‐ Do you not understand
how an encore works?

94
00:05:15.458 --> 00:05:16.833
‐ It's a school night. You know the rules.

95
00:05:16.833 --> 00:05:19.208
‐ Mrs. Lund. because we don't
actually live in this house.

96
00:05:19.208 --> 00:05:20.625
we're gonna stay out as late as we want.

97
00:05:20.625 --> 00:05:21.542
ALYSSA: That's fine.

98
00:05:22.458 --> 00:05:23.375
‐ Sorry. dude.

99
00:05:23.625 --> 00:05:24.625
‐ Sorry. dude.

100
00:05:25.708 --> 00:05:27.917
‐ Well. this is a police state.

101
00:05:27.917 --> 00:05:29.208
Just want to let you know that.

102
00:05:29.208 --> 00:05:30.167
‐ I love you too.

103
00:05:30.167 --> 00:05:31.792
‐ Calling the ACLU.

104
00:05:31.792 --> 00:05:33.458
SARAH:
Has your mom gotten a little bit‐‐

105
00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:36.958
MARCUS: No. it's fine. She definitely is
a little bit more‐‐

106
00:05:37.667 --> 00:05:39.000
‐ Bitchy?
‐ Laura!

107
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.500
‐ Overprotective! Thank you.

108
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.292
Look. I'm the same age
as Alex was when he passed away.

109
00:05:44.292 --> 00:05:46.958
so I think she's just getting
a little extra

110
00:05:47.792 --> 00:05:49.000
"hands‐on."

111
00:05:49.417 --> 00:05:50.333
Thanks.

112
00:05:50.333 --> 00:05:52.750
‐ Well. she means best.

113
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.958
‐ Yeah. But her best can just be
kind of annoying sometimes.

114
00:05:57.083 --> 00:06:00.792
But. you know. at least I have you guys.

115
00:06:00.792 --> 00:06:02.958
LAURA:
Aww. and you always will.

116
00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.875
Except for right now.
because you won't drink.

117
00:06:04.875 --> 00:06:06.958
Sarah and I are gonna go do shots
in the ladies room.

118
00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.083
‐ Oh. come on!
‐ We'll meet you at the front. all right?

119
00:06:08.083 --> 00:06:09.167
‐ Alcoholics.
LAURA: Sorry.

120
00:06:09.167 --> 00:06:10.458
‐ Hey. go watch the opener!

121
00:06:11.458 --> 00:06:14.042
‐ Who is the opener anyway.
some middle school ska band?

122
00:06:14.458 --> 00:06:16.875
Why can't we just admit
that no one cares about the opener

123
00:06:16.875 --> 00:06:18.625
and we should just skip to the‐‐

124
00:06:18.625 --> 00:06:20.375
WOMAN:

125
00:06:20.375 --> 00:06:21.583
‐ ...main attraction.

126
00:06:21.583 --> 00:06:24.458
Now. I don't know if I believe
in love at first sight.

127
00:06:24.875 --> 00:06:26.583
But love at first sound?

128
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.625
Yeah. I could believe that.

129
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.542
stretched out before me

130
00:07:10.792 --> 00:07:12.625
MARCUS:
In a funny sort of way...

131
00:07:12.625 --> 00:07:14.292
‐ Guess that's all the time I have.
‐ What? No!

132
00:07:14.292 --> 00:07:17.792
...the sudden jump from beautiful music
to disappointing silence

133
00:07:17.792 --> 00:07:19.917
was a great foreshadowing
of events to come.

134
00:07:19.917 --> 00:07:21.125
Let her play.

135
00:07:21.125 --> 00:07:23.250
Because spoiler alert.

136
00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.708
sometimes things aren't
exactly as they seem.

137
00:07:26.708 --> 00:07:28.375
What seemed like a great opportunity

138
00:07:28.375 --> 00:07:30.917
to meet one of the best musicians
I've ever heard

139
00:07:32.125 --> 00:07:34.667
was actually a great opportunity
to get elbowed in the face.

140
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.500
And what seemed like an acid trip
going horribly awry

141
00:07:46.917 --> 00:07:48.500
was actually me having a seizure.

142
00:08:21.292 --> 00:08:22.375
‐ Dom.

143
00:08:24.042 --> 00:08:25.792
Hey.
‐ Hey. buddy.

144
00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:27.125
Hi.

145
00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:28.708
Can you hear me?

146
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.417
‐ Where am I?

147
00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:35.000
‐ You're in the hospital. sweetheart.
You had a seizure.

148
00:08:38.083 --> 00:08:39.833
‐ Did it look cool?

149
00:08:58.333 --> 00:08:59.917
ALYSSA:
Are they cancerous?

150
00:08:59.917 --> 00:09:01.833
DOCTOR: No.
Typically. these tumors are benign.

151
00:09:01.833 --> 00:09:04.750
Of course. that's not conclusive
until we get a biopsy.

152
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:07.375
And... I am recommending surgery.

153
00:09:07.875 --> 00:09:08.750
‐ Brain surgery?

154
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.000
DOCTOR: Yes.

155
00:09:11.208 --> 00:09:13.750
We have Dr. Higgins who will be here
at the end of the month.

156
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.625
and we can wait till then to do this.

157
00:09:15.625 --> 00:09:19.333
We'll just give you some medications
that will control any possible seizures.

158
00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:24.417
Because of the location
of this specific tumor.

159
00:09:24.417 --> 00:09:27.167
the whole auditory area is compromised.

160
00:09:27.167 --> 00:09:30.250
so there will be complications
post‐surgical.

161
00:09:31.583 --> 00:09:32.583
‐ My hearing?

162
00:09:33.708 --> 00:09:34.875
‐ Yes.

163
00:09:34.875 --> 00:09:36.458
The biggest one being

164
00:09:37.042 --> 00:09:38.625
you will lose your hearing.

165
00:09:41.125 --> 00:09:42.667
‐ What about hearing aids?

166
00:09:42.667 --> 00:09:46.208
‐ Well. you'll no longer have the anatomy
that would support a hearing aid.

167
00:10:05.667 --> 00:10:07.583
MARCUS: Things were pretty bad there
for a while.

168
00:10:10.333 --> 00:10:12.042
Everything sounded sad.

169
00:10:14.667 --> 00:10:16.542
Like it was saying goodbye.

170
00:10:24.875 --> 00:10:27.083
WOMAN:
Yeah. that should be nice.

171
00:10:29.833 --> 00:10:31.167
WOMAN:
Are they flying in?

172
00:11:22.125 --> 00:11:25.458
‐ And then these. which are
the little white ones‐‐

173
00:11:28.042 --> 00:11:29.000
Are you listening?

174
00:11:30.167 --> 00:11:31.417
‐ Yeah. I got it.

175
00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:33.458
‐ Marcus.

176
00:11:33.458 --> 00:11:34.875
look at me.

177
00:11:35.542 --> 00:11:37.208
If you don't. you know you're going
to have another seizure.

178
00:11:37.208 --> 00:11:38.125
‐ Mom.

179
00:11:40.583 --> 00:11:41.417
‐ All right.

180
00:11:41.875 --> 00:11:44.250
The last one you need to take. um.

181
00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:46.458
every other day. so I figured
Monday. Wednesday. Friday.

182
00:11:47.667 --> 00:11:49.625
Okay?
‐ Cool.

183
00:11:49.625 --> 00:11:51.583
How many of those to kill myself?

184
00:11:56.333 --> 00:11:57.958
‐ He was just kidding.

185
00:12:06.917 --> 00:12:08.708
MARCUS: Do you guys know who the opener
was at The Pyramid?

186
00:12:08.708 --> 00:12:09.792
SARAH: I thought openers sucked.

187
00:12:09.792 --> 00:12:11.833
MARCUS:
No. not this one. She was incredible.

188
00:12:11.833 --> 00:12:13.000
I wish I knew her name.

189
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.208
‐ Was she hot?

190
00:12:14.208 --> 00:12:16.083
‐ It's not about that.
it's about the music.

191
00:12:17.167 --> 00:12:18.292
‐ She was totally hot.

192
00:12:21.792 --> 00:12:24.083
‐ Hey.
Grab your coats. we're going in ten.

193
00:12:24.083 --> 00:12:26.208
‐ What? Where?
‐ To a comedy improv show.

194
00:12:26.208 --> 00:12:27.792
‐ I don't want to go to a comedy show.

195
00:12:27.792 --> 00:12:29.458
‐ It'll be fun.

196
00:12:29.458 --> 00:12:30.333
Come on. girls.

197
00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:31.792
‐ Where is it?

198
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.042
ALYSSA:
It's at West Gate Cathedral.

199
00:12:34.583 --> 00:12:36.000
‐ Church improv?

200
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.167
‐ Hey. I'm gonna tell you something.

201
00:12:37.167 --> 00:12:39.000
I sure hope these donuts is holy!

202
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.458
IMPROVISER: Joseph. I said‐‐
‐  Hey. we can go.

203
00:12:44.458 --> 00:12:45.708
‐ Yes!

204
00:12:46.292 --> 00:12:47.375
Hey. come on.

205
00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:49.917
IMPROVISER:
All right. this next scene. folks.

206
00:12:49.917 --> 00:12:51.667
we need a suggestion from the audience.

207
00:12:51.667 --> 00:12:53.542
I need a gift for baby Jesus.

208
00:12:55.917 --> 00:12:58.750
‐ Having a brain tumor is
the perfect excuse to start drinking.

209
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:00.000
‐ Definitely ask me again

210
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.792
if my mom ever makes me go
to another Friday night at church.

211
00:13:04.042 --> 00:13:05.167
‐ At least she's trying.

212
00:13:05.792 --> 00:13:08.125
‐ Yeah. I get it.
It's just...

213
00:13:09.917 --> 00:13:11.792
I don't want to laugh.

214
00:13:12.583 --> 00:13:14.292
I don't want to pretend to be happy.

215
00:13:14.292 --> 00:13:16.917
You know what I want her to say?
I want her to say.

216
00:13:16.917 --> 00:13:19.417
"Marcus. I'm so sorry.

217
00:13:19.417 --> 00:13:22.667
This really sucks and if I were you.
I'd probably kill myself."

218
00:13:22.667 --> 00:13:25.167
‐ I don't think your mom is going
to tell you to kill yourself.

219
00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:31.292
‐ Yeah. well. she's making me want to.

220
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.458
Look. I don't wanna be
the dramatic sick kid.

221
00:13:36.458 --> 00:13:39.042
but I really love sound.

222
00:13:41.083 --> 00:13:42.958
That sounds so dumb to say but

223
00:13:43.792 --> 00:13:45.000
I really love it.

224
00:13:46.875 --> 00:13:48.667
And I know I have
my whole life ahead of me.

225
00:13:48.667 --> 00:13:51.417
but I just can't help thinking about

226
00:13:51.417 --> 00:13:53.958
all the sounds
I'm never gonna get to hear.

227
00:13:55.333 --> 00:13:57.292
Like the engine of my first car.

228
00:13:58.458 --> 00:13:59.625
Or my kid's laugh.

229
00:14:00.667 --> 00:14:03.625
I know I'm lucky because I'm not dying

230
00:14:03.625 --> 00:14:05.042
and I don't have cancer.

231
00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.583
It's just my hearing.

232
00:14:07.583 --> 00:14:09.917
Obviously I can live without my hearing.

233
00:14:12.375 --> 00:14:14.167
I just don't want to.

234
00:14:17.333 --> 00:14:18.500
Oh shit! Hide the flask!

235
00:14:19.667 --> 00:14:20.667
‐ Hey.

236
00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.792
MARCUS:
Holy shit. my playlist worked.

237
00:14:27.708 --> 00:14:29.125
‐ Ms. Richardson!

238
00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.125
Get some! That's kinda cute.

239
00:14:32.833 --> 00:14:36.250
‐ You know what? I bet AP History teachers
are the kinkiest teachers.

240
00:14:37.417 --> 00:14:39.917
Ooh. but let's not stick around
to find out.

241
00:14:39.917 --> 00:14:42.500
‐ Hey. at least you got to hear this
before you went deaf.

242
00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:46.458
‐ Oh yeah. Ms. Richardson's
cowboy wet dream come true.

243
00:14:46.458 --> 00:14:48.042
You can cross that one off your list.

244
00:14:50.208 --> 00:14:51.750
MARCUS:
Okay. so. yeah. I know it's dumb.

245
00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:54.042
and I wish I could say I came up
with it myself.

246
00:14:54.042 --> 00:14:56.208
But if it weren't
for my history teacher getting laid

247
00:14:56.708 --> 00:14:58.458
the idea would have never come to me.

248
00:14:59.333 --> 00:15:01.792
The Ultimate Playlist of Noise.

249
00:15:04.083 --> 00:15:04.958
The plan was simple.

250
00:15:05.792 --> 00:15:07.667
I would road trip across America.

251
00:15:07.667 --> 00:15:10.375
recording all my favorite sounds
before my surgery.

252
00:15:11.125 --> 00:15:11.958
The big sounds.

253
00:15:12.458 --> 00:15:13.750
the small sounds.

254
00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:15.708
and everything in between.

255
00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:19.542
All I had to do was make a list...

256
00:15:19.542 --> 00:15:21.667
but it had to be perfect.

257
00:15:22.458 --> 00:15:24.458
Nothing boring. No B sides.

258
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:28.333
I wanted the greatest hits album.

259
00:15:30.417 --> 00:15:32.417
A life's worth of hearing
crammed into just one month.

260
00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.875
It would be like a going‐away party
for my ears.

261
00:15:36.875 --> 00:15:39.208
with all my favorite sounds invited.

262
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.042
SARAH: Ooh. what about
a volcanic explosion?

263
00:15:53.542 --> 00:15:56.083
‐ Where are we gonna find
a volcanic explosion?

264
00:15:56.083 --> 00:15:57.375
‐ Yeah? Well. how are you gonna find

265
00:15:57.375 --> 00:16:00.792
"100 Soda Cans Opening
At The Same Time"?

266
00:16:00.792 --> 00:16:02.167
‐ Sounds kinda cool. right?

267
00:16:05.042 --> 00:16:06.000
Yes!

268
00:16:10.208 --> 00:16:11.167
Here it is.

269
00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:13.167
Alex's old mic.

270
00:16:14.292 --> 00:16:15.208
All right.

271
00:16:21.583 --> 00:16:23.292
Testing. testing. one. two‐‐

272
00:16:24.833 --> 00:16:26.167
Jesus. this is dusty.

273
00:16:30.458 --> 00:16:32.292
Testing. testing. one. two‐‐

274
00:16:32.292 --> 00:16:33.625
Still works.

275
00:16:33.625 --> 00:16:35.250
‐ Jesus. this is dusty.
‐ All right.

276
00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:37.417
‐ At risk of sounding
completely insensitive.

277
00:16:38.583 --> 00:16:40.458
why are you recording this
if you're going deaf?

278
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.292
‐ Beethoven was deaf.
he still composed music.

279
00:16:48.417 --> 00:16:50.083
I don't know. watching people listen to it

280
00:16:50.083 --> 00:16:52.000
will be the next best thing
to hearing it again.

281
00:16:53.583 --> 00:16:54.500
‐ Aww.

282
00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:56.750
‐ All right. I got 49 entries.

283
00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:58.875
I need one more.
and I've got an even 50.

284
00:16:58.875 --> 00:17:02.125
SARAH: Okay. my vote is still
volcanic explosion.

285
00:17:02.125 --> 00:17:05.250
Or Cate Blanchett whispering

286
00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:06.333
"I love you."

287
00:17:06.333 --> 00:17:07.708
That might just be a me thing.

288
00:17:07.708 --> 00:17:08.625
LAURA: I love it.

289
00:17:16.292 --> 00:17:17.750
‐ Yello.
MARCUS: Hi.

290
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:19.833
Is this Trolley Studios?
MAN: Yup.

291
00:17:19.833 --> 00:17:21.750
If you wanna book studio time.
go to our website‐‐

292
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:23.375
MARCUS:
Oh no. no. no. actually.

293
00:17:23.375 --> 00:17:26.875
I was wondering if someone I know
ever recorded with you guys.

294
00:17:26.875 --> 00:17:28.542
Maybe a demo or something?

295
00:17:28.542 --> 00:17:29.708
Would have been a while ago.

296
00:17:29.708 --> 00:17:30.917
‐ How long ago we talking?

297
00:17:31.583 --> 00:17:33.458
‐ Like. ten years ago?

298
00:17:33.458 --> 00:17:36.500
MAN:
Oof. Um. okay. who are you looking for?

299
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.708
MARCUS:
Alex Lund.

300
00:17:38.542 --> 00:17:41.667
He's my brother.
‐ Alex? Alex Lund?

301
00:17:42.333 --> 00:17:43.542
You're his brother?

302
00:17:43.542 --> 00:17:45.292
‐ Yeah! You know him?

303
00:17:45.292 --> 00:17:46.917
‐ Dude. I was his drummer!

304
00:17:46.917 --> 00:17:48.708
‐ No way!
MAN: Yes way!

305
00:17:48.708 --> 00:17:51.667
Alex was the all‐time greatest. man.

306
00:17:52.625 --> 00:17:54.500
I miss the hell out of that guy.

307
00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:57.333
You know what?
We totally did record a demo here.

308
00:17:57.333 --> 00:18:00.208
but that would have been ages ago.

309
00:18:00.208 --> 00:18:00.667
Oh!

310
00:18:00.667 --> 00:18:02.792
God!

311
00:18:02.792 --> 00:18:04.042
You in New York?
‐ Yeah.

312
00:18:05.458 --> 00:18:07.125
Yeah. I will be. I just. um.

313
00:18:07.792 --> 00:18:09.208
I just have to talk to my mom first.

314
00:18:09.208 --> 00:18:10.833
MAN: Okay.
‐ Talk to your mom about what?

315
00:18:12.042 --> 00:18:13.000
‐ Um‐‐

316
00:18:21.583 --> 00:18:22.875
‐ Absolutely not.

317
00:18:23.833 --> 00:18:24.667
‐ What?

318
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.917
Why?
ALYSSA: Honey.

319
00:18:26.917 --> 00:18:29.292
you can't go on a road trip to New York.

320
00:18:30.625 --> 00:18:32.417
‐ I mean. was it the tie?

321
00:18:32.417 --> 00:18:34.292
‐ The tie did take me
out of it a little bit.
‐ No.

322
00:18:34.292 --> 00:18:36.208
‐ Dom.
‐ I'm just saying it's a loud tie!

323
00:18:36.208 --> 00:18:37.250
‐ Yeah. it is a loud tie.

324
00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:38.333
DOMINIC: What happened to that
nice blue one I got you?

325
00:18:38.333 --> 00:18:39.708
‐ I spilled Nesquik on it.

326
00:18:39.708 --> 00:18:41.750
‐ Can't we have anything nice‐‐
‐ It's enough with the ties.

327
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:43.042
DOMINIC: Okay.

328
00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:46.125
ALYSSA: Marcus‐‐

329
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.125
Honey.

330
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.917
you have seizure medication to figure out.

331
00:18:50.917 --> 00:18:53.292
you have ASL classes.
you have to finish school‐‐

332
00:18:53.292 --> 00:18:55.083
‐ No. I called. They said I could
finish classes over the summer.

333
00:18:55.958 --> 00:18:58.542
‐ Why can't you just listen
to all the sounds on the internet?

334
00:18:58.542 --> 00:19:01.583
‐ And what. use headphones?
That's like wearing a condom!

335
00:19:01.583 --> 00:19:03.083
‐ Oh. buddy‐‐
‐ What is that supposed to mean?

336
00:19:03.542 --> 00:19:04.958
‐ Okay. Mo‐‐ I'm sorry. Mom.

337
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:10.292
This is the last chance for me to hear
what it sounds like to be alive.

338
00:19:11.458 --> 00:19:13.083
My last chance to hear Alex.

339
00:19:15.792 --> 00:19:17.458
You have to know how much
this means to me.

340
00:19:17.458 --> 00:19:18.708
‐ Sweetheart. I do.

341
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.208
I understand.

342
00:19:33.167 --> 00:19:35.625
I'm sorry. it's not a good idea.

343
00:19:35.625 --> 00:19:37.292
‐ Jesus Christ. why do you have
to be so difficult?

344
00:19:37.292 --> 00:19:39.625
‐ Hey. hey. come on.
‐ No. I mean it!

345
00:19:39.625 --> 00:19:41.167
I have one month left
of my life as I know it.

346
00:19:41.167 --> 00:19:42.958
and you want me to spend it
in a sign language class.

347
00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:45.708
‐ Marcus. you have one month
to prepare for the rest of your life.

348
00:19:45.708 --> 00:19:48.208
‐ I don't care about the rest
of my life. Mom.

349
00:19:53.083 --> 00:19:54.042
God!

350
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:31.625
‐ "Number 17: Fast‐Talking Auctioneer."

351
00:20:32.208 --> 00:20:35.958
You gotta admit. it's a...
it's a pretty good list.

352
00:20:37.125 --> 00:20:39.667
‐ I'm gonna go talk to him.
‐ Okay.

353
00:20:42.458 --> 00:20:43.750
ALYSSA: Marcus. sweetheart.

354
00:20:45.625 --> 00:20:46.708
Can we talk?

355
00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:03.500
‐ Ohh! Okay.

356
00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:04.583
Here we go.

357
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.208
All right. mic check. mic check.

358
00:21:10.042 --> 00:21:13.542
Huh! Hi. I'm Marcus Lund.

359
00:21:13.542 --> 00:21:15.833
and you're listening
to the Ultimate Playlist of‐‐

360
00:21:15.833 --> 00:21:17.583
Holy shit!

361
00:21:17.583 --> 00:21:18.708
Oh my god!

362
00:21:19.042 --> 00:21:20.000
Oh my god!

363
00:21:21.875 --> 00:21:23.083
Oh my god.

364
00:21:23.667 --> 00:21:24.292
Are you okay?

365
00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:26.917
‐ Hitchhikers. yeah?
‐ What?

366
00:21:27.375 --> 00:21:29.333
I'm so sorry. I didn't even see you.

367
00:21:29.333 --> 00:21:30.833
Should I call an ambulance? Are you okay‐‐

368
00:21:30.833 --> 00:21:32.958
‐ Just go! Go!
‐ Oh my god. your head‐‐

369
00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:34.333
‐ Go. go. go. go. go!
‐ Okay. Okay.

370
00:21:34.958 --> 00:21:36.042
Okay.

371
00:21:38.458 --> 00:21:39.542
Sure you're okay?

372
00:21:39.542 --> 00:21:43.250
I could drop you uptown or downtown
or anywhere on the way.

373
00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:46.250
I feel so bad.
I actually don't know what's on the way.

374
00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:47.583
I'm headed to New York!

375
00:21:47.583 --> 00:21:48.833
Also are you hot? Because‐‐

376
00:21:48.833 --> 00:21:50.083
‐ What did you say?

377
00:21:50.083 --> 00:21:52.208
‐ N‐‐ no. not like "are you hot." like‐‐

378
00:21:52.208 --> 00:21:54.750
‐ No. You're going to New York?
‐ Yeah.

379
00:21:55.417 --> 00:21:57.208
Is... is that okay?

380
00:21:58.958 --> 00:22:00.292
‐ How long till we get there?

381
00:22:00.708 --> 00:22:02.292
‐ We?
‐ Yeah.

382
00:22:02.292 --> 00:22:03.417
We. I'm coming.

383
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.417
‐ To New York City. The city of New York.
that's where you're going?

384
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:08.917
‐ Yes.

385
00:22:08.917 --> 00:22:11.667
‐ There's no way you're also going
to New York.

386
00:22:11.667 --> 00:22:12.958
I can barely believe I'm going.

387
00:22:12.958 --> 00:22:14.625
‐ Two people can both want
to go to the same place!

388
00:22:14.625 --> 00:22:17.583
‐ Mmm. no. Not like this. This is weird.

389
00:22:17.583 --> 00:22:18.792
‐ This is not weird!

390
00:22:18.792 --> 00:22:20.208
‐ Yes. it is!
‐ No. it's‐‐

391
00:22:20.917 --> 00:22:21.708
God damn it.

392
00:22:22.792 --> 00:22:24.500
‐ Who's this guy?
WOMAN: Benjie.

393
00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.042
my boyfriend.

394
00:22:26.042 --> 00:22:28.250
‐ Oh.
‐ Or ex‐boyfriend.

395
00:22:28.833 --> 00:22:30.625
‐ Oh.
‐ He's gonna kill us.

396
00:22:30.625 --> 00:22:31.917
‐ Oh!

397
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.208
Shit!

398
00:22:34.958 --> 00:22:36.042
‐ What are you doing?

399
00:22:37.375 --> 00:22:38.958
‐ It's a red light!
‐ So?

400
00:22:39.833 --> 00:22:41.125
‐ There's cars coming.

401
00:22:41.125 --> 00:22:43.083
‐ Jesus Christ!

402
00:22:46.167 --> 00:22:47.208
BENJIE:
Give me the guitar. you bitch!

403
00:22:47.208 --> 00:22:48.500
WOMAN:
I'm not letting you take her.

404
00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:49.500
‐ Where is it?

405
00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.667
‐ No. no. no. no. no.

406
00:22:51.667 --> 00:22:53.667
BENJIE: I told you what would happen.
WOMAN: It's not yours!

407
00:22:53.667 --> 00:22:54.625
‐ Wendy. give me the guitar.

408
00:22:54.625 --> 00:22:56.625
‐ No! Get us out of here!
MARCUS: It's red.

409
00:22:56.625 --> 00:22:57.583
There's cars!
‐ Drive.

410
00:22:57.583 --> 00:22:59.292
‐ I can't.
BENJIE: I'm taking it!

411
00:22:59.292 --> 00:23:00.208
WENDY: Drive!

412
00:23:00.208 --> 00:23:03.333
MARCUS: I've never felt that
"time slowing down" sensation before.

413
00:23:04.042 --> 00:23:05.583
but when Wendy grabbed my knee.

414
00:23:06.042 --> 00:23:08.208
oh my god.

415
00:23:08.708 --> 00:23:10.708
A million thoughts were running
through my head. like

416
00:23:10.708 --> 00:23:14.333
"Should I flex my knee?
Do girls think strong knees are hot?"

417
00:23:15.083 --> 00:23:17.333
I probably should have been
more concerned with the fact that.

418
00:23:17.333 --> 00:23:19.708
you know. she was trying to get me
to voluntarily manslaughter

419
00:23:19.708 --> 00:23:21.542
her ex‐boyfriend with a minivan. but still

420
00:23:22.708 --> 00:23:23.625
look at those eyes.

421
00:23:25.958 --> 00:23:28.250
I'd totally go to jail for those eyes.

422
00:23:29.042 --> 00:23:30.958
‐ Drive!
BENJIE: Give me the goddamn guitar.

423
00:23:31.917 --> 00:23:33.667
MARCUS: Shit! Shit! Shit! Sorry.

424
00:23:33.667 --> 00:23:35.500
BENJIE: Stop the car. you psycho!

425
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.125
‐ You're the psycho. you crazy‐‐
‐ Stop this car!

426
00:23:48.333 --> 00:23:49.208
‐ Hi.

427
00:23:50.167 --> 00:23:51.125
I'm Wendy.

428
00:23:57.875 --> 00:24:00.458
VOICEMAIL: Hey. it's Marcus.
Leave me a message or text me‐‐

429
00:24:04.833 --> 00:24:06.667
‐ He's not answering.
I'm going to go find him.

430
00:24:06.667 --> 00:24:08.667
‐ W‐‐ whoa. whoa!
Hey. wait a minute. Wait‐‐

431
00:24:08.667 --> 00:24:10.083
Hold on. Hold on.
‐ Do you have the keys?

432
00:24:10.083 --> 00:24:11.292
‐ Yes. but just hold on a second.

433
00:24:11.292 --> 00:24:12.958
‐ He is not going
on this stupid road trip.

434
00:24:12.958 --> 00:24:14.042
‐ Stupid?

435
00:24:14.042 --> 00:24:15.292
‐ It's dangerous.

436
00:24:15.292 --> 00:24:17.833
‐ Okay. maybe. but it's not stupid.

437
00:24:17.833 --> 00:24:21.333
Like. dropping out of college
to go backpacking across South America

438
00:24:21.333 --> 00:24:23.250
wasn't stupid.
‐ Dom. they're completely different.

439
00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:25.500
‐ Yeah. We didn't even tell
our parents we were going.

440
00:24:27.875 --> 00:24:30.833
Look. all I'm saying is.
one month from now.

441
00:24:30.833 --> 00:24:34.292
there's a Marcus who never found peace
with losing his hearing.

442
00:24:34.292 --> 00:24:36.583
But there's also a Marcus who did.

443
00:24:36.583 --> 00:24:39.375
And I don't think you and I want
to be the parents

444
00:24:40.083 --> 00:24:42.125
who decides which one he gets to be.

445
00:24:49.167 --> 00:24:50.750
‐ It's not safe.
‐ I know.

446
00:24:51.917 --> 00:24:54.667
He's smart. Like his. like his mom. okay.

447
00:24:54.667 --> 00:24:56.750
He'll stay out of trouble. Don't worry.

448
00:25:01.042 --> 00:25:03.167
MARCUS:
So are we safe now?

449
00:25:03.708 --> 00:25:05.375
‐ Well. that was a terrible introduction.

450
00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:10.458
‐ Oh. we've actually met before.

451
00:25:10.917 --> 00:25:12.333
Kinda.

452
00:25:12.333 --> 00:25:14.083
‐ Wait. are you the kid I stabbed?

453
00:25:14.083 --> 00:25:15.792
‐ What? No!

454
00:25:16.667 --> 00:25:18.083
‐ Okay. Good.

455
00:25:18.583 --> 00:25:19.833
‐ You stabbed a kid?

456
00:25:20.667 --> 00:25:22.875
‐ I accidentally stabbed him. I was like‐‐

457
00:25:22.875 --> 00:25:24.667
We were moshing at Japandroids.

458
00:25:24.667 --> 00:25:27.500
and I just kinda nicked him
in the eye with a corn dog.

459
00:25:28.958 --> 00:25:32.167
‐ Jesus. No. I saw you play
at The Pyramid.

460
00:25:33.583 --> 00:25:35.458
‐ You saw me play?
‐ Yeah.

461
00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:37.375
You were incredible!

462
00:25:38.917 --> 00:25:40.208
You have an amazing voice.

463
00:25:40.208 --> 00:25:44.667
and your song was. like. catchy.
but also different.

464
00:25:45.083 --> 00:25:47.708
‐ People don't usually give
a shit about openers.

465
00:25:49.083 --> 00:25:51.708
‐ Well... one day you'll be the headliner.

466
00:25:58.833 --> 00:25:59.958
‐ Ooh.

467
00:26:01.167 --> 00:26:02.292
Are those fun pills?

468
00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:06.042
Oh no. they're sad pills?

469
00:26:11.292 --> 00:26:12.250
WAITRESS: Enjoy.

470
00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:18.250
‐ "100 Soda Cans Opening
At The Same Time."

471
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:20.667
Easily my favorite.

472
00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:23.250
‐ Sorry.

473
00:26:24.167 --> 00:26:25.917
I can't imagine losing my hearing.

474
00:26:26.833 --> 00:26:28.417
I think I'd wanna kill myself
if I were you.

475
00:26:34.625 --> 00:26:36.583
Well. is this why you're going
to New York?

476
00:26:37.583 --> 00:26:38.583
‐ Yeah.

477
00:26:41.375 --> 00:26:42.375
What about you?

478
00:26:54.125 --> 00:26:55.167
Got enough locks?

479
00:26:55.708 --> 00:26:56.500
‐ No.

480
00:26:57.583 --> 00:27:00.125
What you are about to see is
the single most important thing

481
00:27:00.125 --> 00:27:01.542
in my entire life.

482
00:27:02.792 --> 00:27:03.833
Okay?

483
00:27:03.833 --> 00:27:05.375
‐ Okay.
‐ Okay.

484
00:27:07.208 --> 00:27:09.417
MARCUS: Holy shit.
WENDY: Hmm. This is Darling.

485
00:27:09.417 --> 00:27:10.792
She's a limited edition‐‐

486
00:27:10.792 --> 00:27:13.333
BOTH:
1959 Gold Fender Stratocaster.

487
00:27:14.042 --> 00:27:15.917
‐ Wow. with your obscure guitar knowledge.

488
00:27:15.917 --> 00:27:17.125
‐ Obscure?

489
00:27:17.125 --> 00:27:20.750
Sylvie Scar destroyed one of these
at her Berlin Wall protest!

490
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:21.708
It's my shirt.

491
00:27:22.583 --> 00:27:24.917
Wait. one second. I swear.

492
00:27:27.833 --> 00:27:30.167
‐ Oh wow! It is your shirt.

493
00:27:33.917 --> 00:27:34.667
‐ Can I‐‐

494
00:27:37.583 --> 00:27:38.458
‐ Yeah.

495
00:27:38.458 --> 00:27:39.917
‐ I promise I'll be careful.

496
00:27:39.917 --> 00:27:40.792
‐ Mmm.

497
00:27:43.792 --> 00:27:45.083
‐ Hi. Darling.

498
00:27:46.292 --> 00:27:47.917
She's gorgeous.

499
00:27:47.917 --> 00:27:49.208
‐ Hmm. she is.

500
00:27:50.292 --> 00:27:52.250
She was there for me when no one else was.

501
00:27:54.208 --> 00:27:56.792
Whoa. slow down. St. Vincent.

502
00:27:58.292 --> 00:27:59.792
‐ I only know a few chords.

503
00:28:00.333 --> 00:28:02.375
My brother used to teach me. but. um.

504
00:28:03.042 --> 00:28:04.458
we didn't really get that far.

505
00:28:06.417 --> 00:28:07.375
Thanks.

506
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.250
‐ Wow!

507
00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:15.333
A Sylvie shirt and a ringtone?

508
00:28:15.333 --> 00:28:16.042
Nerd.

509
00:28:17.125 --> 00:28:18.333
MARCUS: Yeah.

510
00:28:18.333 --> 00:28:19.292
I wish I could see her live.

511
00:28:22.333 --> 00:28:23.292
‐ Well.

512
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.500
I don't know. what if you could?

513
00:28:28.833 --> 00:28:30.042
‐ What?

514
00:28:30.042 --> 00:28:31.750
‐ That's why I'm going to New York.

515
00:28:32.625 --> 00:28:34.667
I sent her my demo.
and she wants to meet me.

516
00:28:35.167 --> 00:28:35.958
‐ What?

517
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:37.833
Sorry.

518
00:28:38.625 --> 00:28:40.833
Wendy. this is insane.

519
00:28:40.833 --> 00:28:42.458
I mean. do you really think
she's gonna sign you?

520
00:28:42.458 --> 00:28:43.917
Maybe.

521
00:28:45.333 --> 00:28:46.708
If I get there.

522
00:28:46.708 --> 00:28:48.083
‐ Wow!

523
00:28:55.917 --> 00:28:57.208
He wants to sell Darling.

524
00:28:59.167 --> 00:29:00.375
What a shitty boyfriend.

525
00:29:00.375 --> 00:29:01.417
‐ Ex‐boyfriend.

526
00:29:03.167 --> 00:29:06.167
Look. I know this is all.
like. happening really fast.

527
00:29:06.167 --> 00:29:08.708
and I know you have your playlist
to finish and everything. I just.

528
00:29:10.292 --> 00:29:12.458
I‐‐ I really have to get to New York.

529
00:29:12.458 --> 00:29:14.042
My life depends on it.

530
00:29:15.083 --> 00:29:17.500
Like. Marcus. what are
the chances that we meet?

531
00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.042
Seriously. what are the chances?

532
00:29:19.042 --> 00:29:21.375
I mean. it's crazy. And I know
crazy is supposed to be a bad thing.

533
00:29:21.375 --> 00:29:25.000
but like... what if. just for right now.

534
00:29:26.583 --> 00:29:27.958
crazy is a good thing?

535
00:29:27.958 --> 00:29:29.042
What if

536
00:29:31.875 --> 00:29:33.333
crazy was supposed to happen?

537
00:29:41.042 --> 00:29:43.583
MARCUS:
My brain said. "Don't go with her.

538
00:29:43.583 --> 00:29:45.917
"You have a mission
that doesn't include being curb stomped

539
00:29:45.917 --> 00:29:48.000
by a crazy motorcycle murder‐man."

540
00:29:50.042 --> 00:29:51.042
But then again.

541
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:54.167
my brain did have a gigantic tumor in it.

542
00:29:54.167 --> 00:29:55.458
VOICEMAIL:
Hey. it's Marcus.

543
00:29:55.458 --> 00:29:57.500
Leave me a message
or text me like a normal person.

544
00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.667
MARCUS: So how could I trust
what it said anyway?

545
00:30:01.375 --> 00:30:02.250
Ready?

546
00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:08.250
You! Me! Dancing! playing

547
00:30:55.583 --> 00:30:56.750
‐ Only 80?

548
00:31:00.958 --> 00:31:02.708
‐ All right.

549
00:31:04.333 --> 00:31:05.875
Take two!

550
00:31:07.792 --> 00:31:09.125
Whoo!

551
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.250
The beats. yeah. they were coming
out the speakers

552
00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:32.000
straight in your sneakers

553
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.708
‐ All right. do you want to try
doing it‐‐ push it back.

554
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:36.625
Nice!

555
00:31:49.917 --> 00:31:50.958
MARCUS:
Wendy made me happy.

556
00:31:53.375 --> 00:31:54.375
Really happy.

557
00:31:55.625 --> 00:31:57.125
I didn't stand a chance.

558
00:32:09.375 --> 00:32:10.792
‐ Sold it. $120.

559
00:32:10.792 --> 00:32:11.750
gentleman in the front.
‐ What?

560
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:14.042
She was like one of those
"caution. falling rocks" signs.

561
00:32:15.667 --> 00:32:17.583
Like. what am I gonna do
about falling rocks?

562
00:32:18.417 --> 00:32:19.917
How am I supposed
to take caution against that?

563
00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:24.000
If it happens. it happens.

564
00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:27.125
And oh my god. did it happen.

565
00:32:28.833 --> 00:32:30.667
‐ Aah!

566
00:33:05.625 --> 00:33:07.292
MARCUS:
Wendy was awesome.

567
00:33:09.375 --> 00:33:11.833
She was clever. she was funny.

568
00:33:13.458 --> 00:33:14.500
she was beautiful.

569
00:33:15.167 --> 00:33:16.958
and most of all. she was‐‐

570
00:33:16.958 --> 00:33:18.417
‐ Totally out of your league.

571
00:33:18.417 --> 00:33:20.125
‐ Says who?
LAURA: Says me.

572
00:33:20.125 --> 00:33:22.333
I mean. look at those
cheek bones. dude.

573
00:33:22.333 --> 00:33:23.750
She's like a hard nine.

574
00:33:24.458 --> 00:33:27.250
You're what? A soft six.

575
00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:29.958
‐ What? I'm at least like a seven. eight.

576
00:33:29.958 --> 00:33:31.083
‐ Six‐point‐five.

577
00:33:31.083 --> 00:33:32.875
‐ Well. it's subjective. so‐‐

578
00:33:32.875 --> 00:33:35.417
‐ Look. we just don't want you
coming home with a broken heart. okay.

579
00:33:35.417 --> 00:33:37.250
Those are really hard to fix.

580
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:40.667
‐ My heart is the least of my worries.
It's my brain that's the issue.

581
00:33:40.667 --> 00:33:43.292
‐ Wait. you really like her?

582
00:33:45.208 --> 00:33:46.458
MARCUS: She's different.

583
00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:49.667
‐ Different is what I need right now.

584
00:33:50.792 --> 00:33:52.708
Uhh! All right. I gotta go.

585
00:33:52.708 --> 00:33:53.958
Don't worry about me. okay.

586
00:33:53.958 --> 00:33:55.792
‐ Please be safe!
‐ Try and get laid!

587
00:33:56.333 --> 00:33:57.333
‐ Bye.

588
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:04.542
‐ Oh. hey.

589
00:34:05.292 --> 00:34:07.667
thank you for letting me use
your ancient dildo.

590
00:34:07.667 --> 00:34:09.500
‐ No. I hate it.
I'm definitely throwing it away.

591
00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.250
‐ No. you can't.

592
00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:14.625
It's like an artifact from
the sexual revolution. It's history.

593
00:34:14.625 --> 00:34:15.917
Just use it as a paperweight.

594
00:34:15.917 --> 00:34:18.000
‐ It's way too big to be a paperweight.

595
00:34:18.542 --> 00:34:20.083
‐ Marcus. it's not that big.

596
00:34:32.167 --> 00:34:34.542
Hmm. what do we have here?

597
00:34:35.042 --> 00:34:37.333
MARCUS: Jesus. what the hell
happened here?

598
00:34:37.833 --> 00:34:39.500
WENDY:
I think somebody had a party.

599
00:34:39.958 --> 00:34:41.917
Yech! Ohh!

600
00:34:41.917 --> 00:34:43.333
MARCUS: Oh my gosh.

601
00:34:43.333 --> 00:34:46.167
‐ What are you?
MARCUS: Very. very expired.

602
00:34:46.167 --> 00:34:48.542
‐ This thing looks like
it's from the Reagan administration.

603
00:34:48.542 --> 00:34:49.958
‐ Stay‐‐ stay away from it.

604
00:34:50.917 --> 00:34:52.750
No. let's leave it there.
What are you doing?

605
00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:54.167
Mr. Gorbachev.

606
00:34:54.167 --> 00:34:56.167
tear down this wall.
‐ Okay.

607
00:34:57.292 --> 00:35:00.542
Um. number 13 on my list is
"A Perfect Strike."

608
00:35:00.542 --> 00:35:04.083
If I. uh. kneel down by the pins.
do you think you can try to bowl one?

609
00:35:06.042 --> 00:35:08.000
‐ Yup. I'm a great bowler.

610
00:35:13.583 --> 00:35:14.583
‐ You sure about that?

611
00:35:14.583 --> 00:35:16.042
‐ I'm warming up.

612
00:35:16.792 --> 00:35:18.083
‐ Warm up.

613
00:35:24.333 --> 00:35:26.333
If you want. I can try
to put the bumpers up.

614
00:35:26.333 --> 00:35:27.833
‐ Lick my ass.

615
00:35:27.833 --> 00:35:29.208
‐ Hey. why don't we just switch.

616
00:35:29.583 --> 00:35:31.000
‐ What? No. I can do it!

617
00:35:32.417 --> 00:35:34.375
‐ Mmm. No. you can't.

618
00:35:34.375 --> 00:35:35.708
‐ Why? Because I'm a woman?

619
00:35:35.708 --> 00:35:38.292
‐ No. because you bowl
like a five‐year‐old.

620
00:35:38.292 --> 00:35:40.667
‐ Okay. Well. I bet you I can roll
a strike before you can.

621
00:35:40.667 --> 00:35:42.042
‐ Oh! You bet?

622
00:35:42.042 --> 00:35:42.917
‐ No. I mean‐‐

623
00:35:42.917 --> 00:35:45.125
‐ No. no! If you're so confident.
let's bet. come on!

624
00:35:45.125 --> 00:35:47.542
‐ Okay. Fine! Um.

625
00:35:47.542 --> 00:35:49.458
whoever rolls a strike first
is the winner.

626
00:35:49.458 --> 00:35:51.625
and the loser has to...

627
00:35:51.625 --> 00:35:53.208
‐ Kiss the winner.
‐ ...eat the Reagan dog.

628
00:35:55.042 --> 00:35:56.583
‐ Eat the Reagan dog.

629
00:35:56.583 --> 00:35:58.458
Yup. that's what I said.

630
00:36:01.083 --> 00:36:02.625
You ready?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

631
00:36:02.625 --> 00:36:03.958
‐ Okay.
‐ Okay.

632
00:36:03.958 --> 00:36:05.333
‐ Get ready to lose.

633
00:36:08.625 --> 00:36:10.333
Ohh!

634
00:36:10.333 --> 00:36:12.292
Damn.
‐ Not bad.

635
00:36:12.875 --> 00:36:15.375
‐ Yeah. yeah. go on.
Go roll another gutter.

636
00:36:17.625 --> 00:36:18.750
Not the gutter. remember?

637
00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:20.833
‐ Right. So the middle?

638
00:36:20.833 --> 00:36:22.625
‐ Well. ideally.
‐ Okay. okay.

639
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.875
That's what they call "getting hustled."

640
00:36:33.042 --> 00:36:34.083
Here. you're gonna need this.

641
00:36:35.792 --> 00:36:37.250
Da‐da‐da‐na!

642
00:36:44.375 --> 00:36:46.917
Four more years!
Four more years!

643
00:36:46.917 --> 00:36:48.042
God damn it.

644
00:36:54.958 --> 00:36:56.042
‐ Hey. Marcus.

645
00:36:56.958 --> 00:36:59.167
let's go double or nothing
on some taquitos.

646
00:36:59.167 --> 00:37:01.375
MARCUS:
I hate you.

647
00:37:07.625 --> 00:37:09.125
‐ Uhh! Yeah!
‐ Damn!

648
00:37:09.542 --> 00:37:11.292
That was a good one.
‐ Uhh‐‐

649
00:37:12.583 --> 00:37:14.500
‐ Did you ever just watch hours
of YouTube videos

650
00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:15.542
of people cracking their back?

651
00:37:15.542 --> 00:37:17.958
‐ What? No.

652
00:37:19.042 --> 00:37:20.167
‐ Yeah. me either.

653
00:37:23.875 --> 00:37:24.958
‐ What is that smell?

654
00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:28.500
Is that you?

655
00:37:30.583 --> 00:37:32.333
Oh. you smell like a dead animal.

656
00:37:32.833 --> 00:37:34.208
‐ I don't smell. I just‐‐
‐ Um.

657
00:37:35.083 --> 00:37:36.792
let's go.
‐ Hey. where are you going?

658
00:37:36.792 --> 00:37:38.333
‐ I don't know. to find
a river or something.

659
00:37:38.333 --> 00:37:39.750
We need to clean you up.

660
00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:41.875
‐ You know. actually it's more likely
to drown in a river at night because‐‐

661
00:37:41.875 --> 00:37:43.625
because you can't...
‐ You are so lame!

662
00:37:44.208 --> 00:37:46.625
‐ ...tell how fast the rapids are going.
All right.

663
00:37:50.667 --> 00:37:54.125
Well. now I can add "getting mauled
by a bear" to the list.

664
00:37:55.667 --> 00:37:56.750
‐ Jackpot.

665
00:38:02.125 --> 00:38:03.125
What are you doing?

666
00:38:06.583 --> 00:38:09.250
‐ Rich people. man.
I don't pretend I understand them.

667
00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:12.000
but I will take advantage of them.

668
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.375
‐ No. no. no. what about the river?

669
00:38:15.333 --> 00:38:17.292
‐ Well. I thought rivers were dangerous.

670
00:38:17.292 --> 00:38:18.917
‐ Yeah. but this is illegal.

671
00:38:18.917 --> 00:38:21.708
‐ Well. Marcus.
would you rather break the law

672
00:38:21.708 --> 00:38:23.000
or would you rather drown?

673
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:25.208
‐ There's nothing in between?

674
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:28.917
God.

675
00:38:35.958 --> 00:38:38.333
Yep. I'm a felon now. so that's cool.

676
00:38:49.042 --> 00:38:50.708
‐ Have you never seen a girl
in her underwear before?

677
00:38:52.333 --> 00:38:54.208
‐ Yeah. Like. dozens.

678
00:38:55.458 --> 00:38:56.333
‐ Okay.

679
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:09.792
‐ No.

680
00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:12.583
No. no. we're not shampooing
in someone else's pool.

681
00:39:12.583 --> 00:39:13.458
That's where I draw the line.

682
00:39:13.458 --> 00:39:16.833
‐ Oh. well. you better draw it then.

683
00:39:18.458 --> 00:39:20.000
‐ Am I being hustled again?
‐ What?

684
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:21.958
No.

685
00:39:22.792 --> 00:39:24.042
I pinkie promise.

686
00:39:29.833 --> 00:39:32.042
Woo‐hoo!
‐ Shut up.

687
00:39:37.125 --> 00:39:39.292
‐ Wait. wait. what are you doing?
Take your shirt off.

688
00:39:39.292 --> 00:39:41.750
‐ No. I swim with my shirt on.
‐ Why?

689
00:39:42.208 --> 00:39:43.333
That's weird.

690
00:39:43.333 --> 00:39:44.625
‐ No. it's not.
‐ Yes. it is.

691
00:39:44.625 --> 00:39:46.208
Just take it off.
‐ I don't want to.

692
00:39:46.625 --> 00:39:48.167
‐ Don't be lame. Why?

693
00:39:48.167 --> 00:39:49.250
‐ 'Cause I don't want to!

694
00:39:51.833 --> 00:39:52.708
‐ Fine.

695
00:39:53.833 --> 00:39:54.708
‐ Okay.

696
00:39:57.250 --> 00:39:59.042
Oh. Jesus. it's so cold!

697
00:39:59.042 --> 00:40:00.292
‐ Marcus. just‐‐ Shhh!
‐ Why didn't you tell me it was‐‐

698
00:40:00.292 --> 00:40:01.833
‐ We're gonna die‐‐

699
00:40:01.833 --> 00:40:03.375
MAN: Hey! Who is that?

700
00:40:05.583 --> 00:40:07.583
Get the hell out of my house!

701
00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:11.125
MARCUS: God!
WENDY: Go! Go! Go! Go!

702
00:40:14.375 --> 00:40:15.250
‐ Whoa!

703
00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:16.375
Ah! Ahh!

704
00:40:17.375 --> 00:40:18.958
WENDY:
Come on. you idiot!

705
00:40:23.417 --> 00:40:25.833
It was an indoor pool.
It wasn't that cold.

706
00:40:25.833 --> 00:40:27.792
‐ No. it was basically an ice rink.

707
00:40:31.292 --> 00:40:34.333
‐ Oh. dude. you really
gashed yourself up on that fall.

708
00:40:34.333 --> 00:40:35.458
‐ No. it's fine.

709
00:40:35.458 --> 00:40:38.750
‐ No. no. You need to Neosporin that

710
00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:40.458
before you turn into The Fly.

711
00:40:40.458 --> 00:40:41.583
‐ Don't worry about it.

712
00:40:42.083 --> 00:40:43.417
‐ It's gonna get infected.

713
00:40:44.083 --> 00:40:44.917
‐ No. it won't.

714
00:40:46.833 --> 00:40:47.708
‐ Marcus.

715
00:40:48.708 --> 00:40:49.917
Just let me fix it.

716
00:40:52.333 --> 00:40:53.583
Okay. yeah.

717
00:41:05.375 --> 00:41:07.833
Um. so this is gonna sting.

718
00:41:11.458 --> 00:41:12.667
Almost done.

719
00:41:14.583 --> 00:41:15.583
‐ Thanks.

720
00:41:17.583 --> 00:41:18.833
‐ What are friends for?

721
00:41:20.458 --> 00:41:21.500
‐ Are we friends?

722
00:41:24.458 --> 00:41:25.500
‐ Are we not?

723
00:41:26.958 --> 00:41:30.458
‐ No. I'm not saying we're not.
I was... just checking.

724
00:41:31.833 --> 00:41:33.000
I'm glad we're friends.

725
00:41:35.375 --> 00:41:36.750
‐ I get it.

726
00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:39.167
It's hard for girls
to be friends with you. isn't it?

727
00:41:39.917 --> 00:41:41.000
‐ What?

728
00:41:42.125 --> 00:41:45.708
‐ Well. I mean. for someone who's seen
"dozens of girls" in their underwear.

729
00:41:46.333 --> 00:41:49.708
I'm sure it's like you just want
to be friends with them

730
00:41:49.708 --> 00:41:51.583
but they always want something more.

731
00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:53.750
‐ Yeah.

732
00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:57.000
That for sure happens.

733
00:41:59.042 --> 00:42:01.042
‐ But... not us.

734
00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:03.375
We're just friends. right?

735
00:42:09.458 --> 00:42:11.708
So you're. you're not a virgin?

736
00:42:14.125 --> 00:42:15.083
‐ No.

737
00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:18.125
‐ You've had sex before?

738
00:42:21.958 --> 00:42:25.792
So you know how to...
give a woman what she wants?

739
00:42:31.333 --> 00:42:32.375
Good.

740
00:42:33.542 --> 00:42:36.250
Wouldn't want you going deaf
before you hear a girl orgasm.

741
00:42:37.917 --> 00:42:38.958
Good night. friend.

742
00:42:41.792 --> 00:42:42.792
‐ Good night.

743
00:42:51.125 --> 00:42:52.458
Chainsaw.

744
00:42:54.917 --> 00:42:56.583
Excuse me!

745
00:42:58.250 --> 00:42:59.792
Hey. excuse me!

746
00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:01.125
Hey!

747
00:43:01.625 --> 00:43:03.542
Are you cutting down another tree?

748
00:43:05.458 --> 00:43:07.167
Hey. can I record?

749
00:43:07.167 --> 00:43:08.625
Yeah. Tree?

750
00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:08.417
‐ Can I ask you something personal?

751
00:44:10.583 --> 00:44:11.500
‐ You can try.

752
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.667
‐ Your ex‐boyfriend. Benjie.

753
00:44:17.625 --> 00:44:19.458
Just kinda seemed like a‐‐

754
00:44:19.458 --> 00:44:21.375
‐ Like a piece of shit?

755
00:44:22.875 --> 00:44:23.792
‐ Yeah.

756
00:44:24.917 --> 00:44:26.292
And so.

757
00:44:29.083 --> 00:44:30.833
I‐‐ I don't know. I was just wondering‐‐

758
00:44:30.833 --> 00:44:34.208
‐ Like. why I would date him
in the first place?

759
00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:37.750
‐ Yeah.

760
00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:46.958
‐ Sometimes. you... you meet people who

761
00:44:49.917 --> 00:44:53.125
really. really make you care about
what they think about you.

762
00:44:53.125 --> 00:44:55.125
Like. even if you hate them.

763
00:44:57.542 --> 00:45:00.167
for some reason.
you still want them to like you.

764
00:45:00.875 --> 00:45:02.375
It's like their superpower.

765
00:45:04.208 --> 00:45:06.417
‐ It's a pretty shitty superpower.

766
00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:13.208
‐ He always thought I was dumb
for wanting to be... a rockstar.

767
00:45:17.208 --> 00:45:19.500
‐ Well. it is dumb to want
to be a rockstar.

768
00:45:22.375 --> 00:45:25.125
‘Cause you already are one.

769
00:45:30.375 --> 00:45:31.958
Roller rink!

770
00:45:41.333 --> 00:45:44.042
Well. there's too many people.
I can't get a clean take.

771
00:45:44.042 --> 00:45:45.542
‐ Oh my god. Watch it!

772
00:45:45.542 --> 00:45:47.875
ANNOUNCER: Okay. skaters.
time to grab yourself a partner

773
00:45:47.875 --> 00:45:49.208
and slow things down.

774
00:45:49.208 --> 00:45:51.500
Because it's couple's skate.
and Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now.

775
00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:52.833
‐ Ah. I love this song

776
00:45:52.833 --> 00:45:54.083
‐ Me too.

777
00:45:54.083 --> 00:45:57.250
playing

778
00:46:01.708 --> 00:46:03.208
Hey. maybe we should‐‐

779
00:46:04.167 --> 00:46:05.958
‐ Whoa! Okay.

780
00:46:06.292 --> 00:46:07.875
Okay. you know what? That's it.

781
00:46:07.875 --> 00:46:09.375
Give me that thing.

782
00:46:09.375 --> 00:46:11.208
‐ What? Why?
‐ Give me‐‐

783
00:46:11.208 --> 00:46:13.083
Just keep skating.

784
00:46:15.042 --> 00:46:17.500
‐ Where are you going?
WENDY: Just keep skating.

785
00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:31.208
don't ever look back

786
00:46:33.208 --> 00:46:34.875
‐ Sorry. Sorry.

787
00:46:35.292 --> 00:46:36.250
Sorry.

788
00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:39.667
Baby. we can make it
if we're heart to heart

789
00:46:51.083 --> 00:46:51.958
MAN: Come on!

790
00:46:52.917 --> 00:46:55.792
‐ Wendy.
I think there's a fire.

791
00:46:55.792 --> 00:46:57.792
‐ No. there's not. I pulled the alarm.

792
00:46:57.792 --> 00:46:59.333
‐ What? Why?

793
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:00.958
‐ For us.

794
00:47:02.208 --> 00:47:03.917
We are the fire.

795
00:47:03.917 --> 00:47:04.708
Come on.

796
00:47:06.542 --> 00:47:08.125
‐ Oh yeah!

797
00:47:13.083 --> 00:47:17.500
I will stay here with you

798
00:47:30.625 --> 00:47:32.500
‐ Are you okay?

799
00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:33.875
‐ Yeah. Are you?
‐ Yeah.

800
00:47:33.875 --> 00:47:38.750
Put your arms around me. baby.
don't ever let go

801
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:47.833
if we're heart to heart

802
00:47:47.833 --> 00:47:49.167
‐ What does that mean?

803
00:47:51.583 --> 00:47:53.125
‐ It means my ass is soaked.

804
00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:02.250
‐ Did I get it?

805
00:48:03.375 --> 00:48:05.417
‐ Perfect.
‐ Yay!

806
00:48:08.042 --> 00:48:10.250
WENDY:
This was a terrible idea.

807
00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:11.708
‐ Terrible.

808
00:48:32.167 --> 00:48:33.917
MARCUS: Do you have my mic?
‐ Yeah.

809
00:48:33.917 --> 00:48:35.208
‐ Thanks.

810
00:48:35.208 --> 00:48:37.458
‐ Um. so I'm gonna go check
some voice mails.

811
00:48:37.458 --> 00:48:38.417
‐ You're not coming?

812
00:48:38.417 --> 00:48:41.583
‐ No offense. but "Cows Sound
Kinda Cool I Guess."

813
00:48:41.583 --> 00:48:43.542
uh. sounds like something you wrote
when you were high.

814
00:48:43.542 --> 00:48:46.083
‐ Cows. okay. are
under‐appreciated animals.

815
00:48:46.083 --> 00:48:48.417
and I happen to think
they sound kinda cool. so‐‐

816
00:48:48.958 --> 00:48:50.708
‐ Hey. man. don't let me stop you.

817
00:48:58.250 --> 00:48:59.958
You gotta talk to her sometime.

818
00:48:59.958 --> 00:49:01.583
‐ I thought you had voice mails to check?

819
00:49:14.917 --> 00:49:16.083

Can't wait to see what you got.

830
00:49:32.625 --> 00:49:35.083
‐ Hey. girl.
you got a moo for me?

831
00:49:36.917 --> 00:49:37.667
Okay.

832
00:49:40.542 --> 00:49:41.625
Just one moo.

833
00:49:42.292 --> 00:49:43.708
that's all I need.

834
00:49:43.708 --> 00:49:46.375
BENJIE: And to think
I wasted so many years

835
00:49:46.375 --> 00:49:48.958
pretending I liked
your shitty. boring songs.

836
00:49:48.958 --> 00:49:51.083
You know that's why I came
up to you in the first place. right?

837
00:49:51.083 --> 00:49:53.333
I was like. "Damn. she's hot.

838
00:49:53.333 --> 00:49:54.750
"Maybe if I tell her
she got a nice voice.

Sir. d‐‐ uh. does she moo?

Is there one that moos more?

Hey.
‐ Hey.

846
00:50:33.083 --> 00:50:34.167
‐ How'd the voicemails go?

I think the next town's
about 30 minutes away‐‐

851
00:50:51.125 --> 00:50:53.458
‐ I need a drink. Do you want a drink?

852
00:50:54.417 --> 00:50:55.125
‐ Yeah.

853
00:50:56.125 --> 00:50:57.500
Yeah. we could get a drink.

854
00:50:59.083 --> 00:51:00.250
‐ You've drank before. right?

855
00:51:00.625 --> 00:51:03.792
‐ Yeah. I've... been drunk
a bunch of times.

856
00:51:05.333 --> 00:51:06.583
‐ Cool. dude.

857
00:51:07.125 --> 00:51:10.000
‐ Uh. but come to think of it.
I'll probably just have a sip or two.

858
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.042
‐ Whatever. Fine.

859
00:51:22.458 --> 00:51:25.583
MARCUS: And. like.
you're like a hard nine.

860
00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:28.458
and I'm like a soft six‐point‐five.

861
00:51:29.250 --> 00:51:32.167
And I know I'm supposed
to play "hard to get"

862
00:51:32.167 --> 00:51:35.417
but look at me. I'm so easy to get.

863
00:51:37.458 --> 00:51:40.042
‐ Okay. Okay. okay.

864
00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:42.708
All right. I think you've had enough.
‐ No!

865
00:51:48.833 --> 00:51:50.792
Why didn't you ask me about my scar?

866
00:51:53.375 --> 00:51:56.250
‐ I just figured you've answered
enough questions about it.

867
00:51:57.875 --> 00:51:58.833
‐ Yeah.

868
00:51:59.708 --> 00:52:04.333
Usually that's the case. but right now.
I kinda want to talk about it.

869
00:52:06.125 --> 00:52:07.000
‐ Okay.

870
00:52:09.625 --> 00:52:11.000

00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:12.500

872
00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:14.125

873
00:52:14.125 --> 00:52:15.708
‐ Hey. what's up with that scar?

874
00:52:15.708 --> 00:52:17.500
‐ Oh. thanks for asking.

875
00:52:19.125 --> 00:52:22.208
I. um. I got it when I was a kid.

876
00:52:23.667 --> 00:52:25.500
My house burned down.

877
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.375
and my big brother Alex

878
00:52:30.375 --> 00:52:31.958
died rescuing me.

879
00:52:34.042 --> 00:52:36.458
‐ Oh. I'm... I'm sorry.

880
00:52:36.958 --> 00:52:38.000
‐ Mm. don't be.

881
00:52:40.833 --> 00:52:44.583
‐ I know it's no consolation.
but. um. it's a pretty badass scar.

882
00:52:44.583 --> 00:52:46.625
‐ Nah. It's ugly.

883
00:52:47.458 --> 00:52:51.458
But. you know. I'd rather have
an ugly reminder

884
00:52:51.458 --> 00:52:55.167
that love exists than no reminder at all.

885
00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:00.917
You would have liked him.

886
00:53:01.417 --> 00:53:04.250
He also wanted to be a musician.

887
00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:08.333
and... yeah. he was awesome.

888
00:53:09.375 --> 00:53:12.000
But. you know. he had
to give that up to save me.

889
00:53:14.208 --> 00:53:16.000
He gave up his dream

890
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.250
to save me.

891
00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:23.208
And I look at you.

892
00:53:23.208 --> 00:53:26.708
and I see that you're still chasing
your dream

893
00:53:26.708 --> 00:53:29.417
even after all the shit
you've been through.

894
00:53:30.417 --> 00:53:34.125
And... I don't know.

895
00:53:35.583 --> 00:53:38.542
I just hope that one day you look at me

896
00:53:38.542 --> 00:53:40.083
the same way I look at you.

897
00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:49.292
‐ That's a silly thing to say.

898
00:53:58.292 --> 00:53:59.250
BOTH: Ohh!

899
00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:00.833

904

905
00:54:14.917 --> 00:54:16.917
‐ Welcome to your first hangover.

906
00:54:17.833 --> 00:54:20.542
‐ Oh my God! My head.

907
00:54:20.542 --> 00:54:23.708
Oh. if this is what hangovers are.
I'm never drinking again.

908
00:54:24.125 --> 00:54:25.500
It hurts so much.

909
00:54:26.417 --> 00:54:28.167
‐ Well. this might make you feel better.

910
00:54:29.167 --> 00:54:30.333
MARCUS:
Oh my God. we made it.

911
00:54:30.958 --> 00:54:32.292
We made it.

912
00:54:33.583 --> 00:54:35.750
Oh. wait. wait. I had a... I had a song.

913
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:37.500
I had a song queued for this.

she's my grandmother's cousin.

927
00:56:14.333 --> 00:56:16.792
but I've always just called her my aunt.

928
00:56:16.792 --> 00:56:17.583
MARCUS: Okay.

929
00:56:19.583 --> 00:56:21.500

she was kicked by a deer

930
00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:23.750
in the head when she was five. so just‐‐

931
00:56:24.667 --> 00:56:26.042

WENDY: Hi!

932

AUNT DELILAH:
Oh. it's cold out there.

934
00:56:30.958 --> 00:56:32.083
Oh. Wendy.
‐ Hi!

935
00:56:32.083 --> 00:56:34.208
AUNT DELILAH: It's so good to see you.
‐ You too!

936
00:56:34.208 --> 00:56:36.958
AUNT DELILAH:
Oh my gosh. Aww.

937
00:56:36.958 --> 00:56:38.792
‐ Um. this is Marcus.
This is the kid I told you about.

938
00:56:38.792 --> 00:56:39.875
‐ Oh.

939
00:56:40.375 --> 00:56:42.875
Oh. are you the one that's going blind?

940
00:56:42.875 --> 00:56:45.750
‐ Uh. no. Actually. I'm going deaf.

941
00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:47.417
‐ Oh! Thank goodness.

942
00:56:47.417 --> 00:56:49.917
Oh my gosh. can you imagine going blind?

943
00:56:49.917 --> 00:56:52.125
‐ Yeah. no. it sounds awful.

944
00:56:53.250 --> 00:56:55.375
‐ Sounds! Deaf!

945
00:56:56.458 --> 00:56:57.583
I get it.
WENDY: Right.

946
00:56:57.583 --> 00:57:00.000
‐ I get it. Here. follow me.

947
00:57:01.708 --> 00:57:03.333
Oh! Oh!

948
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.667
‐ You were a cute baby.
‐ Jesus!

949
00:57:25.083 --> 00:57:26.208
You scared me.

950
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.583
‐ How stoked do you think
kid Wendy would be to see you right now?

951
00:57:29.583 --> 00:57:33.000
‐ I don't think three‐year‐old Wendy knew
who Sylvie Scar was.

952
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.583
‐ Yeah. but she'd see that your dreams
were about to come true.

953
00:57:35.583 --> 00:57:37.000
‐ Since when do you drink tea?

954
00:57:37.708 --> 00:57:39.208
‐ Since your aunt insisted.

955
00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:41.625
It's actually not bad.

956
00:57:44.292 --> 00:57:48.042
Although I did just find
a LEGO Minifigure in it.

957
00:57:48.042 --> 00:57:51.042
‐ Yeah. she does that to make sure
the tea bag doesn't get lonely.

958
00:57:52.083 --> 00:57:53.375
‐ All right. that's pretty cute.

959
00:57:58.042 --> 00:57:58.958
You almost ready?

960
00:58:00.125 --> 00:58:01.708
‐ Yeah. um.

961
00:58:01.708 --> 00:58:02.833
I just need a minute.

962
00:58:03.417 --> 00:58:04.292
‐ Okay.

963
00:58:04.958 --> 00:58:06.083
Cool.

964
00:58:06.083 --> 00:58:07.083
I'll go hang out with your aunt.

965
00:58:07.708 --> 00:58:08.750
‐ Have fun.

966
00:58:14.167 --> 00:58:16.292
‐ Okay. I think I'm this way.

967
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.083
‐ Yeah. um. I'm down here.

968
00:58:19.833 --> 00:58:21.083
‐ Okay. Well‐‐

969
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.500
Sing your heart out. Wendy Green.

970
00:58:28.208 --> 00:58:29.375
Sylvie's gonna love you.

971
00:58:31.250 --> 00:58:33.292
‐ Thanks. I will.

972
00:58:35.417 --> 00:58:36.625
‐ Hey.

973
00:58:37.958 --> 00:58:38.833
You okay?

974
00:58:39.292 --> 00:58:41.000

981
00:59:30.125 --> 00:59:32.667
He lives and breathes.
Bring it in. brother.

982
00:59:32.667 --> 00:59:34.375
Oh my God!

983
00:59:35.125 --> 00:59:36.750
Look at you. You work out?

984
00:59:36.750 --> 00:59:37.750
‐ Uh‐‐
‐ Huh?

985
00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:39.458
‐ P. E.
‐ Come on.

986
00:59:39.458 --> 00:59:40.667
I can't get over this.

987
00:59:40.667 --> 00:59:43.458
You look so much like your brother.
it is blowing my mind.

988
00:59:43.458 --> 00:59:44.792
It's all in the eyes.

989
00:59:45.208 --> 00:59:45.958
‐ Thanks.

990
00:59:45.958 --> 00:59:47.917
‐ Let me get that cassette tape.
I'll be right back. all right?

991
00:59:53.125 --> 00:59:54.792
DENNIS: There she is.

992
00:59:55.375 --> 00:59:56.625
Check it out.

993
00:59:56.625 --> 00:59:58.542
It's the only demo I could find.

994
00:59:58.542 --> 00:59:59.833
You know. we were mostly a punk band.

995
00:59:59.833 --> 01:00:02.625
but. uh. this is one
of his more softer songs.

996
01:00:03.583 --> 01:00:04.917
Would never play it live.

997
01:00:15.250 --> 01:00:16.500
All right.

998
01:00:19.292 --> 01:00:22.417
Uh. this is Through the Smoke.

999
01:00:23.083 --> 01:00:24.208
take... four?

1000
01:00:48.708 --> 01:00:50.042
‐ He's so good.

1001
01:01:08.458 --> 01:01:11.000
‐ Did he write these lyrics?
DENNIS: Oh yeah.

1002
01:01:18.625 --> 01:01:21.958
‐ You know. in retrospect. I guess I wish
I would have paid more attention to them.

1003
01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:26.167
but I was young.

1004
01:01:26.167 --> 01:01:27.542
I didn't think about it.

1005
01:01:28.125 --> 01:01:29.667
I just thought they sounded cool.

1006
01:01:30.958 --> 01:01:32.333
‐ What are you talking about?

1007
01:01:36.708 --> 01:01:41.083
‐ I mean. you know. uh.
the‐‐ the whole fire thing.

1008
01:01:41.958 --> 01:01:43.583
‐ What about it?

1009
01:01:43.583 --> 01:01:47.250
‐ You know. how he...
how he started it and everything.

1010
01:01:52.417 --> 01:01:54.208
Okay. you know what? Maybe we should‐‐
‐ No.

1011
01:01:55.125 --> 01:01:58.292
Alex didn't start the fire.
he saved me from it.

1012
01:02:01.292 --> 01:02:02.917
That's the only reason I'm alive.

1013
01:02:04.125 --> 01:02:06.292
‐ You know. maybe you should talk
to your parents.

1014
01:02:06.292 --> 01:02:09.042
‐ No. I'm talking to you right now.

1015
01:02:09.667 --> 01:02:10.833
Let's talk.

1016
01:02:12.917 --> 01:02:14.792
My brother was a hero.

1017
01:02:15.875 --> 01:02:17.375
He saved my life.

1018
01:02:20.875 --> 01:02:24.583
‐ Look. man. I am really sorry.
but that's just.

1019
01:02:25.792 --> 01:02:27.375
that's not what happened.

1020
01:02:38.917 --> 01:02:41.375
Alex started the fire.

1021
01:02:51.208 --> 01:02:54.167
It was a... you know.

1022
01:02:57.875 --> 01:02:59.792
it was a suicide. man.

1023
01:03:07.208 --> 01:03:10.083
The whole scene. we were devastated.
We loved Alex.

1024
01:03:10.083 --> 01:03:13.417
Oh. come on. man. I'm really sorry.
I‐‐ I thought you knew.

1025
01:03:24.542 --> 01:03:25.500
‐ Marcus!

1026
01:03:26.583 --> 01:03:27.792
Marcus. where are you?

1027
01:03:28.458 --> 01:03:31.083
Marcus. ar‐‐ are you okay. sweetheart?
Are you okay?

1028
01:03:31.083 --> 01:03:32.750
‐ Is it true about Alex?

1029
01:03:37.417 --> 01:03:38.417
Mom?

1030
01:03:52.208 --> 01:03:53.000
Wendy!

1031
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.417

1032
01:03:55.417 --> 01:03:56.708

‐ We're having raisins.

1033
01:03:56.708 --> 01:03:58.000

1034
01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.833

and then she grabbed all her stuff.

1036
01:04:03.583 --> 01:04:04.958
and then she called a taxi.

1037
01:04:04.958 --> 01:04:06.208

01:04:43.917 --> 01:04:45.375
Wendy. where's Darling?

1050
01:04:45.375 --> 01:04:46.292
‐ Um.

1051
01:04:47.958 --> 01:04:49.625
I sold her to a dealer.

1052
01:04:49.625 --> 01:04:50.667
MAN:
Hey. lady. you dropped this.

1053
01:04:50.667 --> 01:04:52.083
‐ What about Sylvie?
What about your meeting?

1054
01:04:52.083 --> 01:04:53.542
‐ Uh. yeah. I'll be right there.

1055
01:04:54.375 --> 01:04:56.333
‐ I made it up.
‐ No. no. you sent her your demo.

1056
01:04:56.333 --> 01:04:57.333
She said she wanted to meet you‐‐

1057
01:04:57.333 --> 01:04:58.583
‐ Marcus. I made it up.

1058
01:04:58.583 --> 01:05:00.583
Hey. hands off.
‐ You lied to me?

1059
01:05:00.583 --> 01:05:01.750
MAN: It's in everyone's way.
‐ Um‐‐

1060
01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:03.208
‐ You lied to me for a ride?
‐ What?

1061
01:05:03.208 --> 01:05:05.333
No. No. no. no‐‐
‐ What the hell is wrong with you?

1062
01:05:05.333 --> 01:05:07.625
‐ Marcus. I was in
an abusive relationship.

1063
01:05:07.625 --> 01:05:10.208
I was making music
that no one wanted to hear.

1064
01:05:10.208 --> 01:05:13.458
Darling is my ticket out.
To a normal life.

1065
01:05:13.458 --> 01:05:15.875
Like. some people.
they don't achieve their dreams‐‐

1066
01:05:15.875 --> 01:05:16.542
‐ Stop!

1067
01:05:16.542 --> 01:05:18.125
‐ Some people just have to live
normal lives. and that's okay!

1068
01:05:18.125 --> 01:05:20.833
‐ Okay. Well. I'm glad I let you live
your dream before you gave it up.

1069
01:05:21.958 --> 01:05:23.042
‐ Come on. Marcus. That's not fair.

1070
01:05:23.042 --> 01:05:24.500
‐ Bye. Wendy.
‐ Marcus!

1071
01:05:26.125 --> 01:05:27.292
Marcus.

1072
01:05:32.167 --> 01:05:34.583
Yeah. I'm coming. Back off!

1073
01:05:52.250 --> 01:05:53.292
‐ Marcus?

1074
01:06:14.417 --> 01:06:15.125
‐ Hey!

1075
01:06:15.667 --> 01:06:17.125
‐ Sorry. we're closed. Come back tomorrow.

1076
01:06:17.125 --> 01:06:18.333
‐ Did Marcus come back here?

1077
01:06:20.875 --> 01:06:23.917
‐ Oh. Uh. no. he did not. Why?

1078
01:06:23.917 --> 01:06:25.583
Hey. wait. wait. wait. wait. wait.

1079
01:06:25.583 --> 01:06:28.458
If you see him. can you give this
to him for me?

1080
01:06:29.125 --> 01:06:32.208
I mean. I doubt he'll even want it.
but just in case.

1081
01:06:32.208 --> 01:06:33.542
‐ Why wouldn't he want this?

1082
01:06:34.458 --> 01:06:37.542
‐ Oh boy. I really have
to do this twice today?

1083
01:06:38.875 --> 01:06:40.083
Great.

1084
01:06:44.917 --> 01:06:50.500
Is it really this fun
when you're on my mind

1085
01:06:54.958 --> 01:07:00.792
to be in your life

1086
01:08:05.417 --> 01:08:10.958
when you're on my mind

1087
01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:18.667
to be in your life

1088
01:08:26.958 --> 01:08:28.375
PARAMEDIC:
Sir? Sir. can you hear me?

1089
01:08:31.250 --> 01:08:32.667
PARAMEDIC:
Sir. do you know where you are?

1090
01:10:11.625 --> 01:10:15.333
‐ Alex was diagnosed with bipolar one
when he was 13.

1091
01:10:17.958 --> 01:10:21.958
He struggled with anxiety
and depression and psychosis.

1092
01:10:23.250 --> 01:10:25.542
He took medication and normally he was.

1093
01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:29.042
he was the Alex you remember.

1094
01:10:32.333 --> 01:10:34.458
But sometimes. he would have

1095
01:10:35.417 --> 01:10:36.625
"episodes."

1096
01:10:39.333 --> 01:10:40.875
and he wouldn't be Alex anymore.

1097
01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:49.958
‐ Why didn't you tell me?

1098
01:10:57.292 --> 01:10:58.417
‐ You were young.

1099
01:11:00.708 --> 01:11:02.917
Somehow after the fire.

1100
01:11:02.917 --> 01:11:05.958
when you woke up. you were convinced
that Alex had saved you.

1101
01:11:09.458 --> 01:11:11.125
I couldn't take that away from you.

1102
01:11:21.625 --> 01:11:23.083
To be really honest.

1103
01:11:27.292 --> 01:11:28.958
it was easier to let you believe that.

1104
01:11:32.917 --> 01:11:35.000
‐ He set fire to the house with me in it.

1105
01:11:37.417 --> 01:11:40.083
and you let me believe this whole time
that he was some big hero?

1106
01:11:40.083 --> 01:11:43.333
‐ Alex did not set fire to that house.
his sickness did.

1107
01:11:46.208 --> 01:11:47.292
Marcus‐‐

1108
01:11:47.917 --> 01:11:49.250
‐ How do you live with yourself

1109
01:11:50.542 --> 01:11:52.042
lying to your son like that?

1110
01:12:01.708 --> 01:12:03.625
‐ You can hate me right now. It's okay.

1111
01:12:04.250 --> 01:12:05.333
It's okay.

1112
01:12:06.208 --> 01:12:07.750
Just don't hate Alex.

1113
01:12:08.917 --> 01:12:10.750
Because he was a good kid.

1114
01:12:11.125 --> 01:12:13.125
and he fought his demons every day.

1115
01:12:13.125 --> 01:12:15.625
and he was as much of a victim as you are.

1116
01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:18.458
‐ I guess I didn't really know who he was.

1117
01:12:18.458 --> 01:12:19.417
‐ Yes. you did.

1118
01:12:19.417 --> 01:12:20.625
Marcus. look at me.

1119
01:12:21.875 --> 01:12:23.375
The Alex you knew was real.

1120
01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:26.542
and he loved you so much‐‐

1121
01:12:26.542 --> 01:12:27.917
‐ Bullshit!

1122
01:12:27.917 --> 01:12:29.375
‐ Marcus‐‐
‐ Don't "Marcus" me.

1123
01:12:30.875 --> 01:12:33.875
I drove across the country
to hear his voice

1124
01:12:34.625 --> 01:12:37.292
only to realize that everything
I thought I knew.

1125
01:12:37.292 --> 01:12:39.583
everything I based my life on. was a lie.

1126
01:12:39.583 --> 01:12:41.583
because you didn't have
the courage to tell me the truth.

1127
01:12:41.583 --> 01:12:42.583
‐ I was trying to protect you‐‐

1128
01:12:42.583 --> 01:12:45.375
‐ Yeah. well. you're not really good
at protecting your fucking kids. are you?

1129
01:12:56.875 --> 01:12:57.875
‐ I'm so sorry.

1130
01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:41.458
VOICEMAIL:
Hey. it's Marcus.

1131
01:13:41.458 --> 01:13:43.667
Leave me a message or text me
like a normal person.

1132
01:16:03.708 --> 01:16:04.583
AUCTIONEER: Sold it.

1133
01:16:04.583 --> 01:16:06.625
$120. gentleman in the front.

1134
01:16:12.583 --> 01:16:13.708
MARCUS: What do you think they're saying?

1135
01:16:14.792 --> 01:16:16.208
WENDY:
They're probably flirting.

1136
01:16:41.208 --> 01:16:42.333
MARCUS:
Ladies and gentlemen.

1137
01:16:42.333 --> 01:16:46.333
we are very lucky to be listening
to the very first recording

1138
01:16:46.333 --> 01:16:50.000
of the world's next overnight sensation.

1139
01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:53.458
MARCUS:
I'm happy to have met you. Wendy.

1140
01:16:54.417 --> 01:16:56.667
Don't forget me
when you're all famous. all right?

1141
01:17:25.417 --> 01:17:26.625
Please.

1142
01:17:26.625 --> 01:17:28.417
Selling it was a huge mistake.

1143
01:17:28.417 --> 01:17:30.333
‐ Sorry. All sales are final.

1144
01:17:30.333 --> 01:17:33.667
‐ Come on. man. you have no idea
how much that guitar means to me.

1145
01:17:33.667 --> 01:17:34.708
‐ Buy it back.

1146
01:17:35.417 --> 01:17:37.500
‐ It's twice what I sold it for.

1147
01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:39.208
‐ Sorry. sweetheart. a deal's a deal.

1148
01:17:39.208 --> 01:17:40.458
‐ I don't have that kind of money.

1149
01:17:40.458 --> 01:17:41.542
‐ What are you. deaf?

1150
01:18:52.750 --> 01:18:54.000
WENDY: Hey. it's me.

1151
01:18:55.250 --> 01:18:57.958
I know you're probably
still mad at me. and. uh...

1152
01:19:00.417 --> 01:19:01.625
I don't blame you.

1153
01:19:02.583 --> 01:19:04.583
I really put you through the wringer.

1154
01:19:07.125 --> 01:19:09.000
I found out about your brother. Marcus.

1155
01:19:09.833 --> 01:19:11.167
I'm so sorry. dude.

1156
01:19:12.167 --> 01:19:14.333
I can't imagine how much that hurts.

1157
01:19:16.208 --> 01:19:20.333
But. um. don't let this
change him for you.

1158
01:19:20.708 --> 01:19:23.958
I feel like we grow up
and people are always... saying that.

1159
01:19:23.958 --> 01:19:26.750
no matter what.
everything will work out in the end.

1160
01:19:29.792 --> 01:19:31.208
But I don't know.

1161
01:19:31.708 --> 01:19:34.208
Like. isn't it way more complicated
than that?

1162
01:19:35.625 --> 01:19:39.250
I can't tell you how to live
with your memories of Alex. but.

1163
01:19:41.375 --> 01:19:43.417
God. Marcus. I hope you find a way.

1164
01:19:44.125 --> 01:19:47.583
I hope you can learn to love him
for who he really was

1165
01:19:48.875 --> 01:19:51.125
and not who you imagined him to be.

1166
01:19:52.417 --> 01:19:57.125
Though you do imagine people
to be pretty great.

1167
01:20:01.250 --> 01:20:02.667
I got Darling back.

1168
01:20:02.667 --> 01:20:06.250
It took a little. um... convincing.

1169
01:20:10.542 --> 01:20:12.083
I'm taking my guitar.
MAN: I told you‐‐

1170
01:20:12.083 --> 01:20:14.750
WENDY: Listen. I don't think you know
who you're dealing with. buddy!

1171
01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:17.583
MAN: Jesus Christ!
WENDY: I'm taking my guitar back.

1172
01:20:17.583 --> 01:20:20.000
and if you're smart.
you won't get in my way.
MAN: Put that down!

1173
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.167
That's worth $2.000!
WENDY: I don't care.

1174
01:20:21.167 --> 01:20:22.458
MAN: Who do you think you are?
WENDY: I'm a woman on a mission.

1175
01:20:22.458 --> 01:20:24.333
MAN: You're crazy!
WENDY: Bet your ass I'm crazy. dude!

1176
01:20:24.333 --> 01:20:26.083
MAN: I'm gonna call the cops.
WENDY: Go ahead!

1177
01:20:26.083 --> 01:20:27.708
Here is your money.

1178
01:20:28.375 --> 01:20:30.583
Dude. don't call me "sweetheart."

1179
01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:33.542
Yeah. not my proudest moment.

1180
01:20:33.542 --> 01:20:36.042
But Darling is back home
where she belongs.

1181
01:20:36.042 --> 01:20:39.542
and she wouldn't be if it.
if it weren't for you.

1182
01:20:43.708 --> 01:20:46.167
Anyway. enough of the sappy shit.
I have a surprise for you.

1183
01:20:46.167 --> 01:20:47.542
‐ You ready?
‐ Yeah.

1184
01:20:48.458 --> 01:20:49.542
‐ All right.

1185
01:20:53.625 --> 01:20:55.542
WENDY:
Okay. so it's not perfect.

1186
01:20:55.542 --> 01:20:59.208
but in. like. some dumb kind of way it's.

1187
01:21:00.125 --> 01:21:02.625
maybe that's the point.
you know. that. um.

1188
01:21:02.625 --> 01:21:06.417
reality never really matches
your expectations?

1189
01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:15.875
I... um.

1190
01:21:17.083 --> 01:21:19.500
I just want you to be happy. Marcus.

1191
01:21:21.167 --> 01:21:22.500
I just want you to be happy.

1192
01:21:27.333 --> 01:21:28.167
DENNIS: You good?

1193
01:21:28.917 --> 01:21:30.750
‐ Yeah. Yeah. I think so.

1194
01:21:38.167 --> 01:21:42.542
Far From Home playing

1195
01:23:23.792 --> 01:23:26.208
:
Hi. I'm Marcus Lund.

1196
01:23:26.208 --> 01:23:28.417
and you're listening
to The Ultimate Playlist of‐‐

1197
01:23:28.417 --> 01:23:30.292
Holy shit!

1198

: Nice.

1199
01:23:55.333 --> 01:23:56.292
Perfect.

1200
01:23:58.667 --> 01:23:59.417
Great job.

1201
01:24:11.167 --> 01:24:12.542
‐ The windchimes were beautiful.

1202
01:24:52.750 --> 01:24:53.958
‐ Hey. Dad.

1203
01:24:53.958 --> 01:24:55.583
Can I lock it?

1204
01:24:56.042 --> 01:24:56.917
‐ Yeah.

1205
01:25:31.458 --> 01:25:32.542
‐ You okay?

1206
01:25:33.042 --> 01:25:34.208
‐ Yeah.
‐ Okay.

1207
01:25:34.708 --> 01:25:35.958
‐ Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Yes.

1208
01:25:39.167 --> 01:25:40.208
Check vitals one more time. please.

1209
01:25:40.917 --> 01:25:42.292
That's gonna hit you in a little bit.

1210
01:25:42.292 --> 01:25:44.292
‐ Okay.
‐ You got this.

1211
01:25:44.292 --> 01:25:45.333
NURSE: The waiting room
is right over here.

1212
01:25:45.333 --> 01:25:47.625
‐ Can we. can we stay with him
for a little longer?

1213
01:25:47.625 --> 01:25:48.458
DOCTOR: Mm‐hmm.

1214
01:25:48.458 --> 01:25:49.917
NURSE: I'm just gonna
set you back a bit. okay?

1215
01:25:49.917 --> 01:25:50.875
‐ Okay.

1216
01:26:08.417 --> 01:26:10.292
‐ We'll be right here waiting for you.

1217
01:26:10.792 --> 01:26:11.792
All right?

‐ Wait. Wait. um‐‐

1221
01:26:22.458 --> 01:26:23.625

01:26:24.917 --> 01:26:26.583

‐ Wait. Marcus. hang on. hang on.

1225
01:26:30.167 --> 01:26:32.417
‐ Mom.
‐ I know. It's okay. It's okay.

1226
01:26:35.042 --> 01:26:37.417
‐ I can't do it. I can't do it.
Please. just one more day.

1227
01:26:37.417 --> 01:26:39.583
‐ Okay.
‐ Please. just one more day.

1228
01:26:39.583 --> 01:26:41.583
‐ It's okay.

1229
01:26:43.917 --> 01:26:45.125
Listen to me.

1230
01:26:47.125 --> 01:26:48.500
You're going to be okay.

1231
01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:51.042
I promise you.

1232
01:26:53.042 --> 01:26:55.500
We're right here for you.
We're not going anywhere.

1233
01:26:57.458 --> 01:26:58.292
All right. baby?

1234
01:27:04.958 --> 01:27:06.208
It's gonna be okay.

1235
01:27:09.958 --> 01:27:11.292
‐ Did he like me?

1236
01:27:13.417 --> 01:27:14.667
‐ Oh. sweetheart.

1237
01:27:15.708 --> 01:27:16.833
He loved you.

1238
01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.833
He loved you so much.

1239
01:27:25.708 --> 01:27:27.542
‐ I'm sorry for yelling at you.

1240
01:27:29.250 --> 01:27:30.583
ALYSSA: Ohh!

1241
01:27:36.583 --> 01:27:37.708
Listen to me.

1242
01:27:39.958 --> 01:27:41.167
I love you

1243
01:27:42.083 --> 01:27:44.000
more than anything in the world.

1244
01:32:04.042 --> 01:32:05.458
MARCUS:
If you asked me a few months ago

1245
01:32:05.458 --> 01:32:07.500
what life would be like
without my hearing.

1246
01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:11.708
I wouldn't have been able to answer
because I was too afraid

1247
01:32:11.708 --> 01:32:13.458
of losing such a huge part of me.

1248
01:32:14.833 --> 01:32:16.208
But now.

1249
01:32:16.833 --> 01:32:19.750
I see that life without sound
is still beautiful.

1250
01:32:22.042 --> 01:32:24.042
It's just a different kind of beautiful.

1251
01:32:26.250 --> 01:32:27.292
One that I just met.

1252
01:32:28.292 --> 01:32:29.708
That I'm excited to get to know.

1253
01:32:32.583 --> 01:32:34.000
Just because I can't hear anymore

1254
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.500
doesn't mean I experience my life
any less than I used to.

1255
01:32:39.625 --> 01:32:41.000
'Course I miss sounds.

1256
01:32:45.292 --> 01:32:47.333
Saying goodbye to something
you love is hard.

1257
01:32:49.167 --> 01:32:51.125
But sometimes if I really focus.

1258
01:32:53.125 --> 01:32:54.917
I can still kinda hear it.

1259
01:32:55.333 --> 01:32:56.917
ALEX:
All right. I'll play this.

1260
01:32:57.542 --> 01:32:58.917
and then you play at the same time.

1261
01:32:58.917 --> 01:33:00.542
Green!

1262
01:33:00.542 --> 01:33:02.375
Yellow!

1263
01:33:02.375 --> 01:33:03.875
Orange!

1264
01:33:03.875 --> 01:33:05.583
Orange!

1265
01:33:12.625 --> 01:33:14.458
MARCUS:
All things considered.

1266
01:33:14.458 --> 01:33:15.958
I'd say that my life is pretty great.

1267
01:33:16.458 --> 01:33:18.625
I still have my friends. my family.

1268
01:33:19.042 --> 01:33:21.167
and the adventure that will always
remind me of Wendy.

1269
01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:22.750
And of Alex.

1270
01:33:23.667 --> 01:33:25.208
And that's a life worth living.

1271
01:33:25.208 --> 01:33:26.833
with or without hearing.

1272
01:33:27.875 --> 01:33:28.958
So. now.

1273
01:33:28.958 --> 01:33:30.333
without further ado.

1274
01:33:31.333 --> 01:33:34.167
please enjoy
The Ultimate Playlist of Noise.

1275
01:34:27.542 --> 01:34:29.917
‐ Okay. and then we'll loop that back
into the chorus.

1276
01:34:29.917 --> 01:34:31.042
DENNIS: No problem. Wendy.

1277
01:34:31.042 --> 01:34:32.000
‐ Okay.

1278
01:34:40.042 --> 01:34:41.833
Hey. uh. can I take five?

1279
01:34:56.208 --> 01:34:57.917
ALEX:
All right.

1280
01:34:59.333 --> 01:35:02.167
Uh. this is Through the Smoke.

1281
01:35:02.708 --> 01:35:04.500
take... four?

1282
01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:05.625
Take four.

1283
01:38:31.250 --> 01:38:36.375
near the zoo line

1284
01:38:51.583 --> 01:38:54.292

1285
01:39:00.292 --> 01:39:02.708
