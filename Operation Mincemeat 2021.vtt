01:17:49.875 --> 01:17:50.916
Marco!

4
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.291
- What?
-Listen…

5
01:20:34.875 --> 01:20:36.000
{\an8} All good.

6
01:20:36.083 --> 01:20:38.125
{\an8} …from Cardiff Martín Willy.

7
01:20:38.208 --> 01:20:39.583
{\an8}HUELVA ROMAN CATHOLIC CEMETERY

8
01:20:39.666 --> 01:20:42.708
And then look
what is inside that bag. please.

9
01:20:43.208 --> 01:20:46.541
Thanks for notifying me
a comrade of mine has fallen.

10
01:20:47.041 --> 01:20:50.458
I'm Judge Pascual del Pobil.
instructor of the Spanish Navy.

11
01:20:52.625 --> 01:20:56.291
I guess that would be
a complicated case for a local forensic.

12
01:20:56.375 --> 01:20:58.750
I'm Dr. del Torno.
provisional forensic

13
01:20:58.833 --> 01:21:02.333
and head of pathologic anatomy
department at a university in Madrid.

14
01:21:02.416 --> 01:21:03.916
The local forensic died.

15
01:21:04.916 --> 01:21:08.041
By the way.
I fired the local police of Huelva.

16
01:21:08.125 --> 01:21:11.916
They are corrupted
and controlled by the Nazis.

17
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.833
I will take care of this personally.

18
01:21:14.916 --> 01:21:18.291
It is clear that your naval officer
was floating in water for quite some time.

19
01:21:24.583 --> 01:21:27.250
Since his personal objects
belong to the British government.

20
01:21:27.333 --> 01:21:28.708
you can take them with you.

21
01:21:30.416 --> 01:21:32.083
Me? Take them now?

22
01:21:32.166 --> 01:21:36.541
Yes. No need to go through my superiors.
Commander Gomez-Beare.

23
01:21:36.625 --> 01:21:40.833
The papers are yours
to return to your king.

24
01:21:50.375 --> 01:21:52.375
I appreciate the offer.

25
01:21:52.458 --> 01:21:54.333
But there is a protocol.

26
01:21:54.416 --> 01:21:56.541
and we both know
the minds of naval superiors.

27
01:21:56.625 --> 01:21:58.125
Do you know mine?

28
01:21:58.833 --> 01:22:01.666
-Admiral Moreno?
-Moreno is a hopeless nitpicker.

29
01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:04.916
Moreno is a pain in the ass.

30
01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:08.500
So why rouse the beast?

31
01:22:09.166 --> 01:22:11.708
Better to gather the papers
and keep them here for safe-keeping.

32
01:22:11.791 --> 01:22:14.291
give a full report to Moreno later.
then return them to me.

33
01:22:14.375 --> 01:22:16.708
We could. But it is hot.

34
01:22:16.791 --> 01:22:18.750
Your man stinks.

35
01:22:18.833 --> 01:22:21.291
And lunch and a siesta
are only moments away.

36
01:22:21.375 --> 01:22:24.625
But they are watching. are they not?

37
01:22:26.916 --> 01:22:28.125
Those men.

38
01:22:29.833 --> 01:22:34.166
Fine. if you insist. The papers will go

39
01:22:34.250 --> 01:22:36.916
to our Naval Office in Huelva.

40
01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:41.208
In the meantime.
dear coroner. make this quick.

41
01:22:41.291 --> 01:22:44.333
I see no reason to rush.

42
01:22:44.416 --> 01:22:47.666
I specialized in drownings at the Academy.

43
01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:49.791
so I find this case of great interest.

44
01:22:51.083 --> 01:22:54.625
Specialized in drownings?

45
01:22:54.708 --> 01:22:58.750
Yes. If this case even is a drowning.

46
01:23:41.958 --> 01:23:46.083
Doctor. our man here has clearly drowned.

47
01:23:46.166 --> 01:23:48.791
His body has given up the ghost.
I think we can agree.

48
01:23:48.875 --> 01:23:53.583
There is only one decent thing
we can do now for his poor sodden soul.

49
01:26:39.083 --> 01:26:42.458
In the name of the Father.
the Son. and the Holy Spirit.

50
01:26:42.541 --> 01:26:43.458
Amen.

51
01:26:44.875 --> 01:26:46.083
Jesus Christ…

52
01:26:46.166 --> 01:26:48.458
It will be my funeral next.

53
01:26:49.250 --> 01:26:53.625
I should've taken that
bloody briefcase when I had the chance.

54
01:26:53.708 --> 01:26:57.208
My superiors are frantic for it.

55
01:26:57.708 --> 01:26:59.958
Perhaps the case is already en route.

56
01:27:00.458 --> 01:27:02.541
To where? Have you heard gossip?

57
01:27:03.833 --> 01:27:07.083
This is a small town. Lieutenant.
Treacherously small.

58
01:27:07.583 --> 01:27:09.500
The chair maker has been asking questions.

59
01:27:43.458 --> 01:27:46.083
- Admiral Moreno.
- Come with me. please.

60
01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:57.125
I need to hear
that conversation.

61
01:28:11.583 --> 01:28:13.500
I've missed you. Captain.

62
01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:25.875
Are you here
because you missed me. David?

63
01:29:38.125 --> 01:29:42.333
I am here. Colonel.
out of our shared duty to the Fuhrer.

64
01:29:44.250 --> 01:29:48.708
Admiral Moreno insists
they know nothing of British documents

65
01:29:49.625 --> 01:29:52.791
we know are in his possession.

66
01:29:53.791 --> 01:29:57.458
Papers the Fuhrer needs to see.

67
01:30:01.375 --> 01:30:03.375
And what is in the documents?

68
01:30:05.625 --> 01:30:09.041
Something the British
are very keen to hide.

69
01:30:12.208 --> 01:30:15.875
Now. I know Moreno is incorruptible…

70
01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:19.041
but in your hands…

71
01:30:21.916 --> 01:30:23.333
And what of your hands?

72
01:33:30.958 --> 01:33:32.833
Captain.
this traveling case

73
01:33:32.916 --> 01:33:34.083
has come into our possession.

74
01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:36.625
We don't know its contents.

75
01:33:37.375 --> 01:33:40.333
We do know it's the property
of the British government.

76
01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.833
And at times like these. with countries
at war and allegiances so fragile.

77
01:33:44.333 --> 01:33:46.666
Spain wishes to see
its safe return to its owner.

78
01:33:48.458 --> 01:33:50.125
Thank you very much.
