00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:43.026
It's a bit difficult to explain

4
00:15:43.985 --> 00:15:45.654
Every day you wake up.

5
00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:48.073
and find you have nowhere to go.

6
00:15:48.657 --> 00:15:50.492
It comes to your mind.

7
00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:54.913
"My God. why did you do this?"

8
00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:17.096
Can we get an interview about the Max?

9
00:26:52.778 --> 00:26:54.363
I'm doing OK.

10
00:30:23.864 --> 00:30:26.242
They're going to ask you apparently
about a manager

11
00:30:26.325 --> 00:30:29.286
who sought to halt the production
of the 737 MAX today.

12
00:30:29.912 --> 00:30:32.289
Did you know about anything like that?

13
00:30:32.373 --> 00:30:34.124
What would your response to that be now?

14
00:35:04.561 --> 00:35:08.524
BOEING: So I guess what
I'll start with then. is the control law

15
00:35:08.607 --> 00:35:11.318
that is referred to in the press right now
called MCAS.

16
00:35:11.527 --> 00:35:14.780
So it's just a little bit of software
in the flight control system.

17
00:35:14.863 --> 00:35:18.325
Obviously. in the accident
a couple of weeks ago

18
00:35:18.408 --> 00:35:20.953
it's been reported that
the system misbehaved.

19
00:35:26.291 --> 00:35:28.669
BOEING: A million miles
you're going to fly this airplane.

20
00:35:28.752 --> 00:35:30.796
and maybe once
you're going to see this ever.

21
00:35:30.879 --> 00:35:34.424
So we try not to overload the crews
with information that's unnecessary.

22
00:35:34.508 --> 00:35:37.803
And I don't know that
understanding this system

23
00:35:37.886 --> 00:35:40.889
would have changed the outcome of this.

24
00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:21.462
Administrator Dickson you're our hope.

25
00:56:21.921 --> 00:56:23.130
you are our hope.

26
00:57:58.767 --> 00:57:59.810
Thank you so much.

27
00:57:59.977 --> 00:58:01.228
That took courage.

28
00:58:03.105 --> 00:58:04.982
You're doing the right thing
by making sure it gets fixed

29
00:58:05.107 --> 00:58:06.984
and no other family
has to go through this.

30
00:58:07.151 --> 00:58:08.194
Thank you.

31
01:05:07.321 --> 01:05:08.238
Yeah.

32
01:05:20.584 --> 01:05:23.545
One of our engineers
turned in a safety report

33
01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:25.922
and the manager was upset.

34
01:05:26.381 --> 01:05:28.342
Because now you've got a delay
in the program.

35
01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:31.345
and it's all going to impact
the program's schedule

36
01:05:31.428 --> 01:05:33.388
and managers retaliate.

37
01:05:33.972 --> 01:05:36.308
And so the people that I talk to

38
01:05:36.391 --> 01:05:38.143
said that they have not seen

39
01:05:38.393 --> 01:05:39.478
any change.

40
01:05:41.813 --> 01:05:44.650
There's some real problems
with the organization.

41
01:05:45.651 --> 01:05:48.320
In all fairness. we went through ten years

42
01:05:48.528 --> 01:05:51.698
of just absolutely amazing safety level.

43
01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:57.454
But then. there was a lot of complacency.
both in industry and at the agency.

44
01:05:57.913 --> 01:06:01.667
And Boeing has huge influence politically.

45
01:06:02.167 --> 01:06:05.420
A lot of money put into lobbying Congress.

46
01:06:06.129 --> 01:06:09.216
And it just shows the acceptance
of the Boeing...

47
01:06:09.925 --> 01:06:11.968
the Boeing position on things.

48
01:06:12.511 --> 01:06:15.138
because the Agency and Congress

49
01:06:15.347 --> 01:06:18.016
they are focused on enabling industry

50
01:06:19.351 --> 01:06:22.479
and I think the belief system is
that is safe enough.
