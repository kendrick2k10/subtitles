{\an8}Yes. I did.

{\an8}You know. I just realized
you're drinking wine again.

31
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.410
{\an8}Mm-hmm. I am.

32
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.788
{\an8}Arianna saw Daniel using
a sippy cup on a video chat.

33
00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:03.206
{\an8}and she is a convert.

34
00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:05.291
{\an8}She always wants to do
everything that he's doing.

35
00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:06.459
{\an8}- Ohh!
- So. I welcome

36
00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:09.629
{\an8}caffeine. spicy foods. and...

37
00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.632
{\an8}the nectar of the gods
back into my life.

38
00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:13.675
{\an8}Cheers to that!

39
00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:15.176
{\an8}Cheers.

40
00:02:16.428 --> 00:02:17.721
{\an8}Mm.

41
00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:20.682
{\an8}One more thing for you
to look forward to. Tracy.

42
00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:22.809
{\an8}Oh... hard pass.

43
00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:25.020
{\an8}Nick and I are sure that
we should not be responsible

44
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.438
{\an8}for another human being.

45
00:02:26.438 --> 00:02:29.149
{\an8}He is managing his restaurants
all night long.

46
00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:30.734
{\an8}I'm running the auction house
all day.

47
00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:32.569
{\an8}I'm asleep
when he comes home at night.

48
00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.029
{\an8}he's asleep when
I go to work in the morning.

49
00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:35.405
{\an8}and that is pretty much

50
00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:37.240
{\an8}the entirety
of our relationship.

51
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.783
But it's not like
I don't talk to him about it.

52
00:02:38.783 --> 00:02:40.201
I have tried.

53
00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:42.579
and he always has
these really helpful suggestions

54
00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:43.580
of changes...

55
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.706
I could make.

56
00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:45.957
That you can make?

57
00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:47.292
- Mm-hmm.
- You never had

58
00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:48.752
a honeymoon.
did you?

59
00:02:48.752 --> 00:02:50.879
Avery. we haven't been
in a room together long enough

60
00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.339
to decide where to go.

61
00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:53.423
That's okay.
you'll figure it out.

62
00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:54.341
How?

63
00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:55.842
What do you mean. "how"?

64
00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:58.636
I mean. <i>how?</i>

65
00:02:58.636 --> 00:03:00.221
If you never see each other.
talk to each other.

66
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:03.183
or do something
to fix the situation.

67
00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:04.934
how are you
gonna figure it out?

68
00:03:04.934 --> 00:03:06.936
She kind of has a point.

69
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.078
Hi.

70
00:03:23.078 --> 00:03:24.746
Oh. hey.

71
00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:26.373
How was work?

72
00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:28.375
Ah...

73
00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:30.043
nothing I love more
than 20 tourists

74
00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:31.961
showing up
ten minutes before we close

75
00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:33.046
and being rude
to my staff.

76
00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:34.714
Hope you explained to them

77
00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:37.217
that's not how
we do things in New York.

78
00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:39.427
I wish it was that simple.

79
00:03:39.427 --> 00:03:41.388
I was trying to get
some work done in the office.

80
00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:43.348
and I had to stop that
to go help wait tables--

81
00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:45.475
it was a whole thing.

82
00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:47.811
I was hoping to get out of there
on the earlier side tonight.

83
00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:48.812
I'm sorry you didn't.

84
00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:49.854
Mm.

85
00:03:49.854 --> 00:03:51.523
So...

86
00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:54.109
what are you
still doing up?

87
00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:56.736
I just wanted to talk to you.

88
00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:57.904
Okay.

89
00:03:57.904 --> 00:04:00.407
Like. uh... talk?

90
00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:03.827
Or... "talk" talk?

91
00:04:03.827 --> 00:04:05.453
I was hoping

92
00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:06.746
that we could talk.

93
00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:09.666
so that we can avoid
having to "talk" talk.

94
00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:13.878
I miss you.

95
00:04:13.878 --> 00:04:15.922
I miss us.

96
00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:18.133
Yeah. I miss you. too.

97
00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:19.801
And I was just
thinking about that.

98
00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:22.470
I was thinking
that we needed a date.

99
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.555
You know.
maybe take the morning off...

100
00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:26.433
Mm-hmm. This is more than
just a date.

101
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.061
What we need is our honeymoon.

102
00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:34.149
Honeymoon?

103
00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:36.443
Yeah.

104
00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:37.944
You know. my nonna
was just threatening

105
00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:39.779
to kick me out of the family
for that exact issue.

106
00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:41.031
What?

107
00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:42.824
Apparently. I am not
living up to the standard

108
00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:44.200
set by Serchio men.

109
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.745
Well...

110
00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:48.079
one could argue

111
00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:50.165
that perhaps the standard
was set by Serchio women.

112
00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:52.042
but I know what you mean.

113
00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:53.710
I think you got a point there.

114
00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:57.172
Honeymoon.

115
00:04:57.172 --> 00:04:58.757
Okay.

116
00:04:58.757 --> 00:05:00.300
Where are we going?

117
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.344
I'm so glad you asked.

118
00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:05.221
You are gonna just
close your eyes

119
00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:07.307
and spin.

120
00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:09.100
- Really?
- Seriously!

121
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.268
That is so not like us.

122
00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:11.686
I know.
It's gonna be amazing.

123
00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:12.896
All right.

124
00:05:12.896 --> 00:05:15.106
Keep your eyes closed.

125
00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:18.651
Ooh. Japan!

126
00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:21.488
Oh! That would be so amazing.
And I've been working

127
00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:23.406
with a Japanese firm
that could totally help--

128
00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.576
Right.
No work on our honeymoon.

129
00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:28.036
Japan is out.
Your turn. spin.

130
00:05:30.038 --> 00:05:31.414
Brazil!

131
00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:34.292
Ooh.
Remember my ex-fiancée

132
00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:35.710
that went to Rio to open
two different restaurants?

133
00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:38.880
Your turn again.

134
00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:43.093
Uh... oh!

135
00:05:43.093 --> 00:05:45.303
Know anyone in Greece?

136
00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:47.013
No. You?

137
00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:48.056
No.

138
00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:50.433
Looks like
the island of Rhodes.

139
00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:52.185
Well. I'll start looking up
places for us to stay.

140
00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:55.355
What if... what if

141
00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:57.691
we just booked our first night--

142
00:05:57.691 --> 00:05:58.942
And?

143
00:05:58.942 --> 00:06:01.319
...And then we just play
the rest of it by ear?

144
00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:03.029
Wing it?

145
00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:04.364
Yeah. just wing it.

146
00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:06.241
That is so not like us.

147
00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:08.159
I know.
What the heck? Let's do it.

148
00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:10.453
Yeah. Yeah.

149
00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:11.746
Let's do it.

150
00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:52.662
Wow! This is beautiful.

151
00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:54.831
Too tired to focus my eyes.

152
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:55.915
I'll look later.

153
00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:02.839
Yes. yes. Yes. yes.

154
00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:05.091
Hi.

155
00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:07.218
Welcome to Kallithea.
How may I help you?

156
00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:10.680
Well. we had a reservation
last night. under Serchio.

157
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.392
Ah. Mr. and Mrs. Serchio...
yes!

158
00:07:14.392 --> 00:07:15.727
Oh. we wondered
what happened to you.

159
00:07:15.727 --> 00:07:18.646
Ah. well.
our. uh. plane got delayed.

160
00:07:18.646 --> 00:07:20.190
Mm-hmm. Yes.

161
00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.775
So. I know we had a reservation
for last night.

162
00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:24.652
but we didn't have a plan
for the second night. so...

163
00:07:24.652 --> 00:07:27.030
We were wondering if you had
any vacancies for tonight?

164
00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.531
It's our honeymoon.

165
00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:30.033
Oh! Honeymoon!

166
00:07:30.033 --> 00:07:31.284
Congratulations!

167
00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:33.286
Newlyweds.
How wonderful for you.

168
00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:34.537
Well. we're not exactly n--

169
00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:37.082
So. um...

170
00:07:37.082 --> 00:07:38.917
can we check in early?

171
00:07:38.917 --> 00:07:40.460
I'm afraid not.

172
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.795
Okay. well.
I guess we can wait--

173
00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:42.962
Yeah.

174
00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:46.174
No. I mean.
you cannot check in at all.

175
00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:47.717
We're completely booked up.

176
00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:50.095
Completely?
Like how completely?

177
00:07:50.095 --> 00:07:51.054
Completely. I'm sorry.

178
00:07:51.054 --> 00:07:52.597
Well. do you have

179
00:07:52.597 --> 00:07:54.182
a recommendation
for another place?

180
00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:57.435
Yes. I could. but I doubt
they would have anything either.

181
00:07:57.435 --> 00:08:00.355
There's a very big
football tournament

182
00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:01.815
being held in Rhodes.

183
00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:04.109
I believe you in America
call it soccer. right?

184
00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.362
Yes. well...

185
00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:08.655
for the next few days.

186
00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:10.240
I'm afraid you're not
going to find any hotels

187
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.867
in the entire city of Rhodes.

188
00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:16.913
I'm sorry.

189
00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:21.418
Well. so much for winging it.

190
00:08:21.418 --> 00:08:24.087
I guess we could
go back to the airport.

191
00:08:24.087 --> 00:08:25.672
Oh. no. if that means

192
00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:27.882
getting on an airplane
again today.

193
00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:30.260
preemptively. no.

194
00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:37.017
Excuse me.

195
00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:39.978
I'm so sorry to interrupt.
but I just overheard you inside.

196
00:08:39.978 --> 00:08:41.771
My name is Penelope.

197
00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:43.273
Everyone calls me "Pen".
Excuse me.

198
00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:44.774
Hi. Pen.

199
00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:48.194
I. um. run a delivery boat
between islands.

200
00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:52.032
I'm going down to Lindos--
a tiny town in the south.

201
00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:55.285
Also. the most romantic places
in all of Greece!

202
00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:58.538
There's a beautiful old inn there.

203
00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:00.832
being fixed up
by a brother and sister.

204
00:09:00.832 --> 00:09:03.168
I heard your problem.
so I texted them.

205
00:09:03.168 --> 00:09:04.794
and there's a room available.

206
00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:07.422
I would be happy
to give you a lift.

207
00:09:07.422 --> 00:09:09.341
They are very good hosts.

208
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.054
When things seem too good
to be true.

209
00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:15.138
they usually are.

210
00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:16.598
Yeah. sorry.
we're a little skeptical.

211
00:09:16.598 --> 00:09:18.600
you know.
being from New York and all.

212
00:09:19.851 --> 00:09:21.936
I'm just too tired
to deal with a shakedown

213
00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:23.938
in the middle
of the Aegean Sea.

214
00:09:23.938 --> 00:09:24.856
I'm sorry. Pen.

215
00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:29.861
I make you a deal.

216
00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:31.821
Since I'm going there anyway.

217
00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:33.865
you don't have to pay
for the ride.

218
00:09:33.865 --> 00:09:36.117
Think of it
as a wedding gift.

219
00:09:55.387 --> 00:09:57.097
- Hey. Pen!
- Hey. Leo.

220
00:09:57.097 --> 00:09:58.098
Why aren't you in school?

221
00:09:58.098 --> 00:09:59.391
Half-day.

222
00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:00.475
For everyone.
or just for you?

223
00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:07.065
So how far is this place?

224
00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:08.108
Not that far.

225
00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:09.901
Just on the other side
of the town.

226
00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:11.111
Wait.

227
00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:12.862
Please...

228
00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:15.448
please tell me there's
a taxi stand somewhere nearby.

229
00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:16.950
Oh. no cars allowed.

230
00:10:17.826 --> 00:10:19.619
What do you mean. no cars?

231
00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:21.037
How do we get there?

232
00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:40.724
Hello!

233
00:10:40.724 --> 00:10:42.267
You must be Nick and Tracy.

234
00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:43.351
You're Tessa?

235
00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:44.644
Yes!

236
00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:46.021
If I'd known
you had arrived at the harbor.

237
00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:48.189
I'd have picked you up
in a cart.

238
00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:49.357
Wait. wait. wait...

239
00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:51.401
you have carts?

240
00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:53.028
Sure.

241
00:10:53.028 --> 00:10:54.487
Never mind.
you're here now.

242
00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:56.573
So. welcome to Casita Casita.

243
00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:58.867
This way. please.

244
00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:00.910
Oh! Oh!

245
00:11:09.127 --> 00:11:10.253
Oh. thank you.

246
00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:14.507
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

247
00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:16.509
Nice to meet you.

248
00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:17.761
Please. Come!

249
00:11:17.761 --> 00:11:21.181
Well. I'm afraid we do have
a late check-out

250
00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:22.432
in our honeymoon suite.

251
00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:24.184
but you are more than welcome

252
00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:26.269
to use one of the other rooms
to rest.

253
00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:27.395
then we can move you later.

254
00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:28.688
Is that okay for you?

255
00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:30.523
Oh. yes. yes.

256
00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:31.858
Tessa. you could
give me a pillow.

257
00:11:31.858 --> 00:11:34.152
and I would fall asleep
right here.

258
00:11:34.152 --> 00:11:36.863
I think I'd do all right
with just a flat rock.

259
00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:40.033
Well. I'm sure
we can do better than a rock.

260
00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:43.536
Oh. I have to go.
Okay. room four.

261
00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:45.038
Here.
Up the stairs on the left.

262
00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:47.165
Sorry.

263
00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:51.378
Okay. well. we're almost there.

264
00:11:51.378 --> 00:11:53.213
So close.

265
00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:57.634
Ah. it's so beautiful.

266
00:11:57.634 --> 00:11:58.885
Yeah. it is.

267
00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:00.887
I'm just glad the veil
made it safely.

268
00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:03.264
and I'm gonna air it out.

269
00:12:05.016 --> 00:12:06.893
So... what do you
want to do first?

270
00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:42.262
Hi.

271
00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:43.722
What's your name. please?

272
00:12:43.722 --> 00:12:45.223
I'm Tracy.

273
00:12:45.223 --> 00:12:46.474
My name is Leo.

274
00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:47.976
Short for Leonidas.

275
00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:50.603
Leonidas?
Like the runner?

276
00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:51.813
Yes!

277
00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:53.773
I'm a runner. too.

278
00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:56.776
Many Americans
don't know about Leonidas.

279
00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:59.362
Well. I'm a history buff.

280
00:12:59.362 --> 00:13:02.282
What is a "buff"?

281
00:13:02.282 --> 00:13:04.075
A buff is a person who...

282
00:13:04.075 --> 00:13:05.827
likes something
or studies something

283
00:13:05.827 --> 00:13:07.495
more than other people.

284
00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:09.914
Well. I'm an art buff.

285
00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:12.042
and I'm drawing
a picture of you.

286
00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:15.295
How much?

287
00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:18.214
You know what really matters?

288
00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:19.966
Is that you have
a picture to take with you.

289
00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:21.718
to remind you of Lindos.

290
00:13:21.718 --> 00:13:23.470
Uh-huh.

291
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.180
How much?

292
00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.307
Tracy... Tracy.

293
00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:29.476
Can you really put a price
on memories?

294
00:13:30.894 --> 00:13:33.229
Well. you can.
if you want me to pay for it.

295
00:13:34.564 --> 00:13:36.107
Five Euros?

296
00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:39.986
Can I see it?

297
00:13:39.986 --> 00:13:42.197
Yes.

298
00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:47.285
Wow!

299
00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:49.913
That's really good.

300
00:13:49.913 --> 00:13:50.914
Ah. there you are!

301
00:13:50.914 --> 00:13:52.415
I want you to meet somebody.

302
00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:53.750
This is Xander.

303
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.001
This is Tessa's brother--
he's the chef here.

304
00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:56.127
This is my wife. Tracy.

305
00:13:56.127 --> 00:13:57.921
- Nice to meet you.
- And you.

306
00:13:57.921 --> 00:14:00.882
Leo. I asked you
not to bother the guests.

307
00:14:01.675 --> 00:14:02.509
Don't eat here.

308
00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:04.386
Save yourselves!

309
00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:09.224
Kids.

310
00:14:17.524 --> 00:14:19.567
Tessa!

311
00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:21.403
They want some lunch.

312
00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:23.405
How is my s <i>tifatho</i> coming?

313
00:14:23.405 --> 00:14:25.615
Oh. it's... coming.

314
00:14:25.615 --> 00:14:27.492
Mm. mm. mm. mm!

315
00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:28.993
Okay.

316
00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:30.120
I'll come with the luggage
to the honeymoon suite

317
00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.372
and after.
we'll serve together.

318
00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:34.374
Okay.

319
00:15:07.991 --> 00:15:10.326
It's nice. right?

320
00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:11.327
It is.

321
00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:12.328
Mm.

322
00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:13.329
Quiet.

323
00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:14.789
No sirens.

324
00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:16.583
no people screaming
at each other.

325
00:15:17.876 --> 00:15:19.794
How are we gonna get to sleep?

326
00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:22.380
Okay.

327
00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.590
Lunch is served.

328
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:24.591
It looks good.

329
00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:26.092
Uh-huh.

330
00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:28.720
Uh. this is Xander's
special s <i>tifatho.</i>

331
00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.472
It's a Greek stew.

332
00:15:30.472 --> 00:15:32.932
Uh. enjoy.

333
00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:34.809
Is it always so quiet here?

334
00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:36.394
Well. it won't be soon.

335
00:15:36.394 --> 00:15:39.105
I have two more guests arriving
late tomorrow from England.

336
00:15:39.105 --> 00:15:40.357
I think this is the first time

337
00:15:40.357 --> 00:15:42.525
we've ever had
three rooms booked.

338
00:15:42.525 --> 00:15:44.652
It's so exciting.

339
00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:46.363
That's wonderful.

340
00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:52.744
Well?

341
00:15:52.744 --> 00:15:54.579
What do you think?

342
00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:59.084
This is. um... really. mm...

343
00:15:59.834 --> 00:16:01.336
Interesting?

344
00:16:01.336 --> 00:16:03.672
- Mm.
- I'm so glad you like it!

345
00:16:03.672 --> 00:16:04.923
Nick. I noticed
your last name.

346
00:16:04.923 --> 00:16:06.216
Are you Italian?

347
00:16:07.384 --> 00:16:08.635
Bravo.

348
00:16:08.635 --> 00:16:10.053
Then tomorrow. I will cook
some Italian pasta

349
00:16:10.053 --> 00:16:11.346
in your honor.

350
00:16:11.346 --> 00:16:12.931
Okay. go.

351
00:16:12.931 --> 00:16:14.516
I'll go get you some water.

352
00:16:14.516 --> 00:16:15.475
Thank you!

353
00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:16.559
Thank you so much.

354
00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:17.811
What was that?

355
00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:20.105
Oh... my eyes are watering.

356
00:16:24.401 --> 00:16:27.153
Xander's food is awful.
I couldn't even swallow it.

357
00:16:27.153 --> 00:16:29.322
My mouth actually just refused.

358
00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:30.657
I feel bad for Tessa.
She must know.

359
00:16:30.657 --> 00:16:32.200
Mm-hmm.

360
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.868
She just doesn't want to hurt
her brother's feelings.

361
00:16:33.868 --> 00:16:36.246
Why didn't we get
more of this baklava?

362
00:16:36.246 --> 00:16:37.622
Because we have
to pace ourselves.

363
00:16:37.622 --> 00:16:38.832
We do?

364
00:16:38.832 --> 00:16:40.333
Is that a rule?

365
00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:42.419
Yeah. only when it comes
to donkey rides.

366
00:16:43.837 --> 00:16:46.423
Oh... Nick?

367
00:16:46.423 --> 00:16:49.009
Yes?

368
00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:50.510
Can I ask you something?

369
00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:52.053
Anything.

370
00:16:52.053 --> 00:16:55.807
Can we never talk about
the donkey rides again ever?

371
00:16:55.807 --> 00:16:57.058
Okay. pinky promise.

372
00:16:57.058 --> 00:16:59.394
Oh... pinky promise.

373
00:16:59.394 --> 00:17:01.521
Hey. Tracy!

374
00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:02.897
Hi! Leo?

375
00:17:02.897 --> 00:17:04.357
Nick. you remember Leo. right?

376
00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:05.567
Hi.

377
00:17:05.567 --> 00:17:07.610
You know what.
I owe you for that picture.

378
00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:08.945
Yes! 10 Euros.

379
00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:10.697
Five Euros.

380
00:17:10.697 --> 00:17:13.074
Don't try to hustle me. kid.

381
00:17:13.074 --> 00:17:14.868
We're from New York.
It's not going to work.

382
00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:16.036
You're from New York?

383
00:17:16.036 --> 00:17:17.495
I love New York.

384
00:17:17.495 --> 00:17:19.706
That's how I learned
to speak English so good.

385
00:17:19.706 --> 00:17:20.915
Ahem!

386
00:17:20.915 --> 00:17:23.335
"In the criminal justice system.

387
00:17:23.335 --> 00:17:25.795
the people are represented
by two separate

388
00:17:25.795 --> 00:17:28.298
yet equally important groups..."

389
00:17:28.298 --> 00:17:29.799
Very nice. very nice.
very nice.

390
00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:31.176
That was really good. Wow!

391
00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:37.640
I've got to go before
the goblin catches me. Bye!

392
00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.601
Bye!

393
00:17:49.444 --> 00:17:51.696
He's a really talented kid.

394
00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:52.697
Yeah.

395
00:17:52.697 --> 00:17:54.491
Odd. but pretty cute.

396
00:18:07.337 --> 00:18:08.254
Nick?

397
00:18:11.299 --> 00:18:13.134
Nick?

398
00:18:14.928 --> 00:18:16.429
I knew it!

399
00:18:16.429 --> 00:18:20.183
I'd recognize the smell
of that marinara sauce anywhere.

400
00:18:20.183 --> 00:18:21.601
Uh-huh.
and it smells delicious.

401
00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:24.187
I had horrible jet lag.
I couldn't sleep.

402
00:18:24.187 --> 00:18:25.647
So you're cooking?

403
00:18:25.647 --> 00:18:28.149
Oh. just a little.

404
00:18:29.234 --> 00:18:31.403
Tessa and Xander
are really nice people.

405
00:18:31.403 --> 00:18:32.612
and they have been working
their tails off

406
00:18:32.612 --> 00:18:33.863
trying to get this place
up and running.

407
00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:35.699
and it's all gonna get torpedoed

408
00:18:35.699 --> 00:18:36.741
because Xander is literally

409
00:18:36.741 --> 00:18:38.952
the worst cook
in the entire world.

410
00:18:38.952 --> 00:18:40.286
We're on vacation.

411
00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:42.372
It's our honeymoon.
and you're working!

412
00:18:42.372 --> 00:18:43.373
Mm-hmm.

413
00:18:43.373 --> 00:18:44.624
This is Xander's sauce.
Try it.

414
00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:45.625
Nick.

415
00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:47.627
<i>Try it.</i>

416
00:18:52.841 --> 00:18:55.301
- Oh. that was so gross.
- I got you. I got you.

417
00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:02.600
Okay. so what's your plan?

418
00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.436
You're just gonna replace
his sauce with yours?

419
00:19:04.436 --> 00:19:06.521
That is exactly the plan.

420
00:19:07.647 --> 00:19:09.524
We had a deal. Nick.

421
00:19:10.525 --> 00:19:12.736
It's just
a little marinara sauce.

422
00:19:12.736 --> 00:19:14.904
It's not like I'm managing
an entire kitchen.

423
00:19:14.904 --> 00:19:15.989
Here.

424
00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:17.323
I woke up alone.

425
00:19:17.323 --> 00:19:19.409
in the middle of the night.
on our honeymoon.

426
00:19:19.409 --> 00:19:21.202
For me.

427
00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:22.787
it feels like
you're still working.

428
00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:29.210
Goodnight.

429
00:19:42.349 --> 00:19:43.933
<i>Okay. but that's kind of sweet.</i>

430
00:19:43.933 --> 00:19:45.185
<i>No. it is sweet.</i>

431
00:19:45.185 --> 00:19:46.394
<i>I understand</i>

432
00:19:46.394 --> 00:19:48.563
that I'm the bad guy
in this story.

433
00:19:48.563 --> 00:19:49.564
It's just. well.
we promised each other

434
00:19:49.564 --> 00:19:51.399
we wouldn't work
on our honeymoon.

435
00:19:51.399 --> 00:19:52.942
and we didn't even
last a day.

436
00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:56.613
And you haven't answered
any texts from Stanley?

437
00:19:57.655 --> 00:19:59.074
That's different.

438
00:19:59.074 --> 00:20:00.575
Tracy. how is it different?

439
00:20:00.575 --> 00:20:02.160
<i>I don't know! It's just--
It's different.</i>

440
00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.495
<i>Well. I for one.</i>

441
00:20:03.495 --> 00:20:05.914
<i>am very jealous
about your trip.</i>

442
00:20:05.914 --> 00:20:07.082
Oh! Me too.

443
00:20:07.082 --> 00:20:08.333
Except for the donkey part.

444
00:20:08.333 --> 00:20:10.460
That was sort of fun. though.

445
00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:13.171
All right. here. You have
to check out this place.

446
00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:14.506
Isn't it gorgeous?

447
00:20:14.506 --> 00:20:15.924
Oh. speaking of gorgeous...

448
00:20:15.924 --> 00:20:17.425
<i>Hello. ladies!</i>

449
00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:19.344
Hello!

450
00:20:19.344 --> 00:20:20.261
<i>I'm gonna leave
you two honeymooners</i>

451
00:20:20.261 --> 00:20:21.763
alone now. Bye.

452
00:20:21.763 --> 00:20:22.847
Have fun. you two!

453
00:20:22.847 --> 00:20:24.808
Bye.

454
00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:30.271
So. you forgive me
for abandoning you last night?

455
00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:32.649
Of course. I do.
I understand.

456
00:20:32.649 --> 00:20:34.109
You do?

457
00:20:34.109 --> 00:20:35.944
Yeah. I do.

458
00:20:35.944 --> 00:20:38.279
Thanks.

459
00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:40.323
What are you reading?

460
00:20:40.323 --> 00:20:42.200
Your mind.

461
00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.493
Ooh!

462
00:20:47.997 --> 00:20:50.500
<i>Kalimera!</i>

463
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.210
Lady Dalton and Mr. Dalton.

464
00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:54.462
I'm Alexandros.
but you can call me Xander.

465
00:20:54.462 --> 00:20:56.256
- Call me Colin. please.
- Let me help you with those.

466
00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:04.014
Grandma?

467
00:21:05.682 --> 00:21:08.476
I'm sorry my sister. Tessa.
isn't here to greet you.

468
00:21:08.476 --> 00:21:10.770
but she had to run into town.

469
00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:13.523
I'm sure we'll catch up later.

470
00:21:16.693 --> 00:21:17.986
Okay.

471
00:21:17.986 --> 00:21:20.321
Colin. we have you upstairs
in room number four.

472
00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:21.823
and Lady Dalton.

473
00:21:21.823 --> 00:21:24.409
you are right next to Colin
in room number five.

474
00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:25.493
- Perfect.
- Lady Dalton.

475
00:21:25.493 --> 00:21:27.037
do you have trouble
with the stairs?

476
00:21:27.037 --> 00:21:30.165
Because we can accommodate you
downstairs. if needed.

477
00:21:30.165 --> 00:21:31.875
Don't be absurd.
young man.

478
00:21:33.251 --> 00:21:35.253
We have a couple
from New York staying. too.

479
00:21:35.253 --> 00:21:37.172
Nick and Tracy.

480
00:21:37.172 --> 00:21:38.465
You'll get to meet them
at dinner.

481
00:21:38.465 --> 00:21:41.509
Do they have trouble
with the stairs?

482
00:21:42.594 --> 00:21:44.596
We look forward
to meeting them.

483
00:21:54.564 --> 00:21:55.732
Hey.

484
00:21:55.732 --> 00:21:56.775
Aw.

485
00:21:57.942 --> 00:21:59.194
Last one to the bar
buys the margaritas.

486
00:21:59.194 --> 00:22:00.695
What? Wait!

487
00:22:00.695 --> 00:22:01.696
Hold on!

488
00:22:01.696 --> 00:22:03.114
Wait for me!

489
00:22:11.206 --> 00:22:12.749
Hey. Leo.

490
00:22:12.749 --> 00:22:13.958
Hi.

491
00:22:13.958 --> 00:22:15.043
Hey. Tracy.

492
00:22:15.043 --> 00:22:16.586
Hi.

493
00:22:16.586 --> 00:22:19.255
So. um.
what are you working on?

494
00:22:19.255 --> 00:22:21.675
Nothing.

495
00:22:23.426 --> 00:22:25.261
Do you know
that I went to college

496
00:22:25.261 --> 00:22:26.680
and studied art history?

497
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.182
It's what I do now.
for a living.

498
00:22:29.182 --> 00:22:31.101
You draw?

499
00:22:31.101 --> 00:22:33.144
Well. not nearly as well
as you do.

500
00:22:34.396 --> 00:22:35.605
But do you know what I can do?

501
00:22:35.605 --> 00:22:37.065
What?

502
00:22:37.065 --> 00:22:39.025
I can tell
when someone's work

503
00:22:39.025 --> 00:22:40.902
really comes from their heart.

504
00:22:40.902 --> 00:22:43.405
There's an honesty to it.

505
00:22:43.405 --> 00:22:45.990
It's something you can't fake.

506
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:49.119
It means the difference
between a good piece

507
00:22:49.119 --> 00:22:50.537
and a great one.

508
00:22:54.624 --> 00:22:56.334
I'll see you later. Leo.

509
00:22:56.334 --> 00:22:58.211
See you. Tracy.

510
00:23:13.143 --> 00:23:14.811
Thank you!

511
00:23:29.159 --> 00:23:30.910
Hey there!

512
00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:33.163
Everyone's meeting
down at the bar for a drink.

513
00:23:33.163 --> 00:23:34.956
All right. I'll be right down.

514
00:23:37.125 --> 00:23:40.253
Oh... wow.
Room with a view.

515
00:23:40.253 --> 00:23:42.339
Oh. it's incredible.
isn't it?

516
00:23:42.339 --> 00:23:45.717
And the fragrance-- I just love
the smell of the sea air.

517
00:23:45.717 --> 00:23:47.177
Mm-hmm.

518
00:23:48.553 --> 00:23:49.846
Can you believe
we finally made it?

519
00:23:51.056 --> 00:23:53.266
Mm.

520
00:23:55.894 --> 00:23:57.020
What's that?

521
00:23:58.063 --> 00:23:59.230
Oh.

522
00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:02.192
It's a sketch
that Leo did for me.

523
00:24:02.192 --> 00:24:03.526
Oh.

524
00:24:03.526 --> 00:24:05.320
And he just gave it to you?

525
00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.113
For free?

526
00:24:07.113 --> 00:24:09.491
Kid's got some talent.

527
00:24:09.491 --> 00:24:11.326
And there's a story there. too.

528
00:24:11.326 --> 00:24:14.371
Something going on with him
he doesn't want everyone to see.

529
00:24:14.371 --> 00:24:15.497
That's a shame.

530
00:24:15.497 --> 00:24:17.082
He's way too young for that.

531
00:24:17.082 --> 00:24:19.626
No kid should have to hide
who they really are.

532
00:24:19.626 --> 00:24:21.961
You're a good man.
Nick Serchio.

533
00:24:21.961 --> 00:24:23.880
Mm.

534
00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.840
Don't believe
everything you hear.

535
00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.801
Nick?

536
00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:30.804
What's wrong?

537
00:24:32.222 --> 00:24:34.307
Nick. where's the veil?

538
00:24:40.063 --> 00:24:43.149
I know I left it
in the closet of room four

539
00:24:43.149 --> 00:24:44.526
when we were in there.

540
00:24:44.526 --> 00:24:45.694
Xander probably forgot
to take it

541
00:24:45.694 --> 00:24:46.695
when he transferred our rooms.

542
00:24:46.695 --> 00:24:48.530
I'm sure
that's what happened.

543
00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:49.906
but let me
just figure this out--

544
00:24:49.906 --> 00:24:52.200
- Oh! Ahh!
- Whoa! Sorry. sorry.

545
00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.077
No. it's my fault.

546
00:24:56.871 --> 00:24:59.374
Uh... you must be Mr. Dalton?

547
00:24:59.374 --> 00:25:01.084
It's Colin.

548
00:25:01.084 --> 00:25:02.335
Ah. Mr. Colin.

549
00:25:02.335 --> 00:25:04.629
No. just... just "Colin".

550
00:25:04.629 --> 00:25:06.131
Ah. Oh. Colin.

551
00:25:06.131 --> 00:25:07.465
Yes. Uh. I'm Tessa.

552
00:25:07.465 --> 00:25:09.843
Oh. Um...

553
00:25:09.843 --> 00:25:13.388
Sorry. I found this wedding veil
in my wardrobe.

554
00:25:13.388 --> 00:25:15.348
Does...
Does it belong to anyone?

555
00:25:15.348 --> 00:25:16.725
Yes! Uh...

556
00:25:16.725 --> 00:25:18.393
it belongs
to Nick and Tracy.

557
00:25:18.393 --> 00:25:19.519
- That'd be us.
- That's us.

558
00:25:19.519 --> 00:25:21.229
- Oh. sorry.
- Yeah.

559
00:25:21.229 --> 00:25:22.397
Thank you so much.

560
00:25:22.397 --> 00:25:23.273
Pleasure to meet you guys.

561
00:25:25.275 --> 00:25:27.569
So. uh...
who's getting married?

562
00:25:27.569 --> 00:25:30.280
It's actually quite a story.

563
00:25:32.073 --> 00:25:34.284
Want to hear it?

564
00:25:40.457 --> 00:25:42.417
This sauce is exceptional.

565
00:25:42.417 --> 00:25:44.002
Mm! My compliments
to the chef.

566
00:25:47.297 --> 00:25:50.175
Tessa... Xander. why don't you
sit and eat with us?

567
00:25:50.175 --> 00:25:51.009
Yes. please.

568
00:25:51.009 --> 00:25:52.010
Join us?

569
00:25:53.887 --> 00:25:55.263
Uh. sure.

570
00:25:55.263 --> 00:25:58.433
You were saying there's
a story regarding your veil?

571
00:25:58.433 --> 00:26:00.143
The lace work
is extraordinary!

572
00:26:00.143 --> 00:26:02.729
Thank you. yes.
It's from the 1800s--

573
00:26:02.729 --> 00:26:04.731
from the House of Stefano
in Burano. Italy.

574
00:26:04.731 --> 00:26:05.857
Oh. and you have it with you

575
00:26:05.857 --> 00:26:07.108
because you're
on your honeymoon?

576
00:26:07.108 --> 00:26:09.486
Actually. we've been married
for three years.

577
00:26:09.486 --> 00:26:10.737
Yeah. but we are
on our honeymoon...

578
00:26:10.737 --> 00:26:11.988
it's just a little delayed.

579
00:26:11.988 --> 00:26:13.198
My dear boy.

580
00:26:13.198 --> 00:26:15.075
that's not a delay--
that's criminal neglect!

581
00:26:15.075 --> 00:26:17.369
I'm surprised
you're still married.

582
00:26:18.787 --> 00:26:20.622
Why are you traveling
with the veil. then?

583
00:26:20.622 --> 00:26:23.041
Oh. we're taking it
to my sister Monica in Spain.

584
00:26:23.041 --> 00:26:25.001
- So she's getting married?
- No.

585
00:26:25.001 --> 00:26:27.087
She's not even dating anyone.

586
00:26:27.087 --> 00:26:28.963
And I'll let Tracy
take it from here.

587
00:26:30.256 --> 00:26:33.259
Okay. My two best friends and I
were antiquing

588
00:26:33.259 --> 00:26:37.055
and this shop owner told us
that the veil has a legend.

589
00:26:37.055 --> 00:26:39.641
that whoever is in possession
of the veil

590
00:26:39.641 --> 00:26:41.476
will find true love.

591
00:26:41.476 --> 00:26:43.561
So. of course. the three of us
had to buy it together.

592
00:26:43.561 --> 00:26:47.023
And were you all engaged
at that time?

593
00:26:47.023 --> 00:26:48.274
Not even close.

594
00:26:48.274 --> 00:26:50.026
How fun!

595
00:26:50.026 --> 00:26:52.487
So. did the legend
come to pass?

596
00:26:52.487 --> 00:26:55.073
Well. my friends would say yes.
but I'm--

597
00:26:55.073 --> 00:26:56.700
Skeptical?

598
00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.284
Skeptical. Exactly.

599
00:26:58.284 --> 00:26:59.744
Although. all three of you
did meet your husbands

600
00:26:59.744 --> 00:27:01.454
while you were
holding the veil.

601
00:27:01.454 --> 00:27:03.498
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

602
00:27:03.498 --> 00:27:05.667
And actually.
my friend's mother-in-law

603
00:27:05.667 --> 00:27:07.502
and my other friend's
assistant.

604
00:27:07.502 --> 00:27:10.714
So. my sister. Monica.
is very. um...

605
00:27:10.714 --> 00:27:11.923
She's spicy.

606
00:27:11.923 --> 00:27:13.967
Yeah. uh. "spicy marinara".

607
00:27:15.176 --> 00:27:17.053
So. my family thought
it'd be a good idea

608
00:27:17.053 --> 00:27:18.680
to give her
a little gentle nudge.

609
00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:22.225
And if the magic of the veil
works again?

610
00:27:22.225 --> 00:27:25.145
If the veil works
for a sixth time...

611
00:27:25.145 --> 00:27:28.314
then even I will
have to believe in it.

612
00:27:28.314 --> 00:27:31.568
Aw... I love romantic stories!

613
00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:33.778
Well...

614
00:27:33.778 --> 00:27:35.321
here's to romance!

615
00:27:35.321 --> 00:27:36.656
Romance.

616
00:27:44.622 --> 00:27:47.125
Morning!

617
00:27:47.125 --> 00:27:48.877
Morning.

618
00:27:48.877 --> 00:27:50.420
Morning?
Morning?

619
00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:51.963
- Hmm!
- Oh!

620
00:27:51.963 --> 00:27:53.590
Uh...

621
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:55.425
that's a lovely shade.

622
00:27:55.425 --> 00:27:57.218
Does it match my eyes?

623
00:27:57.218 --> 00:27:58.595
Uh. I'm so sorry.

624
00:27:58.595 --> 00:28:00.597
No. no.
it's-it's completely my fault.

625
00:28:00.597 --> 00:28:01.723
I-I shouldn't have
startled you.

626
00:28:01.723 --> 00:28:03.183
No. no.
I'm gonna get you a rag.

627
00:28:03.183 --> 00:28:05.643
Actually...
It's quite a nice effect.

628
00:28:05.643 --> 00:28:07.604
It definitely
improves the shirt.

629
00:28:07.604 --> 00:28:09.272
No. you're just being kind.

630
00:28:09.272 --> 00:28:10.315
I'm not.

631
00:28:10.315 --> 00:28:11.983
And look. you know.

632
00:28:11.983 --> 00:28:14.903
seeing as I've already been
consecrated in. um...

633
00:28:14.903 --> 00:28:16.863
some shade of blue
I can't read--

634
00:28:18.031 --> 00:28:19.616
"Mediterranean blue."

635
00:28:19.616 --> 00:28:20.909
Yes.

636
00:28:20.909 --> 00:28:22.994
Do you. um.
have an extra brush?

637
00:28:24.788 --> 00:28:26.414
Ah. But...

638
00:28:26.414 --> 00:28:28.166
But you're our guest.

639
00:28:28.166 --> 00:28:29.668
A guest who's on London time.

640
00:28:29.668 --> 00:28:31.544
I-I've been up for hours.

641
00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.507
Sure. Um...

642
00:28:35.507 --> 00:28:37.092
which one do you pick?

643
00:28:37.092 --> 00:28:38.593
Uh...

644
00:28:38.593 --> 00:28:40.178
that one.

645
00:28:41.846 --> 00:28:43.056
Okay. like this?

646
00:28:43.056 --> 00:28:44.057
Yeah. I like this one.
It's good.

647
00:28:51.856 --> 00:28:53.566
Ah. I could get used
to swimming every day.

648
00:28:53.566 --> 00:28:55.944
Well. you could always go
swimming in the Hudson at home.

649
00:28:55.944 --> 00:28:57.195
Yeah. if you want me
to start glowing.

650
00:28:58.613 --> 00:29:01.116
Nick. where's the veil?

651
00:29:04.452 --> 00:29:06.746
- Hi!
- Hi...

652
00:29:06.746 --> 00:29:07.789
Can we look
in your closet. please?

653
00:29:11.876 --> 00:29:14.504
Okay. This is weird.

654
00:29:14.504 --> 00:29:15.505
Isn't it?

655
00:29:15.505 --> 00:29:17.507
Uh. is everything okay?

656
00:29:17.507 --> 00:29:19.300
Yes. it is now.

657
00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:22.345
My veil migrated
back to Colin's closet.

658
00:29:22.345 --> 00:29:23.346
What?

659
00:29:23.346 --> 00:29:24.639
Please understand--

660
00:29:24.639 --> 00:29:26.099
I'm just as confused
about all this as you are.

661
00:29:26.099 --> 00:29:27.559
I've been with Tessa
all morning.

662
00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.645
Painting.

663
00:29:30.645 --> 00:29:32.272
It's true!

664
00:29:32.272 --> 00:29:35.859
So you're not
an international veil thief?

665
00:29:35.859 --> 00:29:37.485
I stick to jewelry. mainly.

666
00:29:37.485 --> 00:29:39.070
The occasional sports car.

667
00:29:40.697 --> 00:29:42.532
I love mysteries.
"Who did it?"

668
00:29:42.532 --> 00:29:44.367
Not me.

669
00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:49.414
Look. the veil didn't
just get up and walk away.

670
00:29:49.414 --> 00:29:50.999
Hi! Hello.

671
00:29:50.999 --> 00:29:52.667
Will you have dinner
with us tonight?

672
00:29:52.667 --> 00:29:53.877
No.

673
00:29:53.877 --> 00:29:55.587
- We're just--
- We're going for...

674
00:29:55.587 --> 00:29:56.713
...into town...
- ...town. uh...

675
00:29:56.713 --> 00:29:58.173
- ...for dinner.
- Dinner.

676
00:29:58.173 --> 00:29:59.507
But stay tomorrow.
because I'm making <i>pastitsio--</i>

677
00:29:59.507 --> 00:30:01.009
it's like Greek lasagna.

678
00:30:01.009 --> 00:30:02.635
I'm starting it tonight.

679
00:30:02.635 --> 00:30:04.763
It's better
if it has time to sit.

680
00:30:04.763 --> 00:30:06.222
Ah.

681
00:30:06.222 --> 00:30:07.682
Is <i>pastitsio</i> hard to make?

682
00:30:07.682 --> 00:30:09.267
Not if
you know how to cook.

683
00:30:13.063 --> 00:30:15.648
I found a book of Greek letters
for Daniel.

684
00:30:15.648 --> 00:30:16.900
Okay.

685
00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:18.234
And then. look
at this cute little outfit

686
00:30:18.234 --> 00:30:20.278
I found for-- oh!
...Arianna.

687
00:30:20.278 --> 00:30:21.529
So cute. right?

688
00:30:21.529 --> 00:30:23.656
And then I got this...

689
00:30:23.656 --> 00:30:26.159
art supplies
for Leo.

690
00:30:27.243 --> 00:30:29.120
Leo?

691
00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:32.123
Isn't it weird to buy
a kid you don't know a gift?

692
00:30:32.123 --> 00:30:34.584
Well. you've seen his pencil--
it's like an inch long!

693
00:30:34.584 --> 00:30:36.586
And he's drawing on envelopes.

694
00:30:41.299 --> 00:30:43.468
I got a hypothetical question
for you here.

695
00:30:43.468 --> 00:30:44.928
Let's just say

696
00:30:44.928 --> 00:30:47.430
some stranger bought
your child a gift--

697
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:49.265
would you feel uneasy?

698
00:30:49.265 --> 00:30:51.768
Well. my child would not
be selling their drawings

699
00:30:51.768 --> 00:30:53.353
for five Euros
on the dock.

700
00:30:54.771 --> 00:30:57.524
I'm just trying
to help him with that.

701
00:30:57.524 --> 00:30:59.317
Yeah.

702
00:31:02.904 --> 00:31:04.489
Do you hear that?

703
00:31:05.824 --> 00:31:07.367
I don't hear anything.

704
00:31:07.367 --> 00:31:08.451
Exactly.

705
00:31:08.451 --> 00:31:10.120
How long do you think
it'll take us

706
00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:12.455
to get used
to all this quiet around here?

707
00:31:12.455 --> 00:31:15.959
Well. I could use a good
car alarm right about now.

708
00:31:24.676 --> 00:31:26.261
Leo!

709
00:31:26.261 --> 00:31:27.637
Oh. Leo. hey.
I'm so glad you're here.

710
00:31:27.637 --> 00:31:28.680
Hi. Tracy and Nick.

711
00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.140
I'm sorry.
I've got to go.

712
00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:32.392
Well. I just--
I have something for you.

713
00:31:32.392 --> 00:31:34.019
Here.

714
00:31:35.228 --> 00:31:37.731
Thank you. but... no. I can't.

715
00:31:37.731 --> 00:31:40.525
Oh. it's from me to you.

716
00:31:40.525 --> 00:31:42.652
Tracy. I...

717
00:31:42.652 --> 00:31:43.987
Please. please.
consider it

718
00:31:43.987 --> 00:31:45.155
payment for the drawing
that you made me.

719
00:31:45.155 --> 00:31:47.991
Okay.

720
00:31:47.991 --> 00:31:49.451
Thank you. Thank you.

721
00:31:49.451 --> 00:31:50.827
I've got to go! Bye!

722
00:31:50.827 --> 00:31:52.037
Bye.

723
00:31:57.584 --> 00:32:00.086
I just made a huge mistake.
didn't I?

724
00:32:03.048 --> 00:32:04.132
Hello. Leo.

725
00:32:07.719 --> 00:32:09.429
And what do we have here?

726
00:32:22.567 --> 00:32:24.819
Nick?

727
00:32:26.946 --> 00:32:29.282
Nick?

728
00:32:38.333 --> 00:32:39.626
Really?

729
00:32:39.626 --> 00:32:41.211
Mm.

730
00:32:41.211 --> 00:32:44.381
Um. yeah. I-I hadn't made
<i>pastitsio</i> in a while.

731
00:32:44.381 --> 00:32:46.591
and. um. I thought
I'd jump in.

732
00:32:46.591 --> 00:32:48.677
Wait. you're replacing
his entire dish now?

733
00:32:48.677 --> 00:32:51.262
Ooh. trust me--
it was not salvageable.

734
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:54.516
Do you mind grating
a little cheese for me?

735
00:32:55.725 --> 00:32:58.144
Uh. forgive the intrusion.

736
00:32:58.144 --> 00:33:00.146
I was looking for...

737
00:33:00.146 --> 00:33:01.481
never mind.

738
00:33:01.481 --> 00:33:04.859
Oh! Oh. you're. uh...
making <i>pastitsio?</i>

739
00:33:04.859 --> 00:33:06.528
- I am.
- Huh.

740
00:33:06.528 --> 00:33:08.238
Ahh!

741
00:33:08.238 --> 00:33:10.281
This is all
making sense now.

742
00:33:10.281 --> 00:33:11.700
What is?

743
00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:15.286
I couldn't quite figure out
how last night's marinara

744
00:33:15.286 --> 00:33:18.289
came from the same kitchen
as tonight's moussaka.

745
00:33:18.289 --> 00:33:20.125
I take it the. uh. marinara
was yours?

746
00:33:20.125 --> 00:33:21.918
Guilty. Shh.

747
00:33:21.918 --> 00:33:24.462
He owns two very successful
restaurants in New York City.

748
00:33:24.462 --> 00:33:25.422
Oh. really?

749
00:33:25.422 --> 00:33:27.257
Well. very good.
Well done. you.

750
00:33:27.257 --> 00:33:29.217
Well. I shall. uh...
leave you to it

751
00:33:29.217 --> 00:33:32.470
and I look forward
to tasting it.

752
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:33.847
Toodle-pip!

753
00:33:35.306 --> 00:33:36.516
Is this enough cheese?

754
00:33:36.516 --> 00:33:38.685
Aw. come on.
what kind of question is that?

755
00:33:38.685 --> 00:33:39.811
Is there ever enough cheese?

756
00:33:39.811 --> 00:33:42.272
Good point.

757
00:33:42.272 --> 00:33:44.107
Oh. here. let me. uh...

758
00:33:44.107 --> 00:33:45.608
lend you
a little assistance.

759
00:33:45.608 --> 00:33:46.484
Mm-hmm.

760
00:33:48.278 --> 00:33:49.988
Ah. you look so beautiful
when you cook.

761
00:33:55.994 --> 00:33:57.287
Morning!

762
00:33:58.413 --> 00:33:59.706
Morning.

763
00:33:59.706 --> 00:34:01.791
I'm. uh. heading into town.

764
00:34:01.791 --> 00:34:04.336
Yeah. I thought I might
do a bit of shopping.

765
00:34:04.336 --> 00:34:06.629
Okay. Have a good day.

766
00:34:06.629 --> 00:34:08.840
I have a question.

767
00:34:10.508 --> 00:34:12.552
Yes?

768
00:34:12.552 --> 00:34:13.720
Haggling--

769
00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.472
uh. yes or no?

770
00:34:15.472 --> 00:34:17.474
Oh. uh. no.

771
00:34:17.474 --> 00:34:20.060
I mean. in Greece.
the price is always the price.

772
00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:21.311
Oh. good.

773
00:34:21.311 --> 00:34:22.812
I'm terrible at it.

774
00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:29.444
Uh. I...

775
00:34:29.444 --> 00:34:31.988
actually have
a little bit of time.

776
00:34:31.988 --> 00:34:33.948
if you need an interpreter.

777
00:34:33.948 --> 00:34:35.492
Yes!

778
00:34:35.492 --> 00:34:39.037
<i>Yes!</i>
I would really appreciate that.

779
00:34:39.037 --> 00:34:40.580
Okay. I'll go change.

780
00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.004
I said no work. Stanley.

781
00:34:48.004 --> 00:34:50.131
Because I'm on my honeymoon!

782
00:34:50.131 --> 00:34:51.549
No!

783
00:34:51.549 --> 00:34:53.551
No. No.

784
00:34:53.551 --> 00:34:54.678
Wait...

785
00:34:54.678 --> 00:34:56.012
and no!

786
00:34:56.012 --> 00:34:57.931
Goodbye. Stanley.

787
00:34:59.557 --> 00:35:01.226
Nick and I promised each other
we wouldn't work

788
00:35:01.226 --> 00:35:02.435
on our honeymoon.

789
00:35:02.435 --> 00:35:04.270
but my colleague
is very determined.

790
00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:05.814
What do you do. my dear?

791
00:35:05.814 --> 00:35:08.733
I work at an auction house
that's affiliated with the Met.

792
00:35:08.733 --> 00:35:11.486
I think you do more
than just work in it.

793
00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:14.447
You're in charge. aren't you?

794
00:35:14.447 --> 00:35:16.366
That's why they call you
on your honeymoon.

795
00:35:16.366 --> 00:35:18.868
Yeah. I guess I am.

796
00:35:20.203 --> 00:35:22.872
Don't undersell yourself.
my dear.

797
00:35:22.872 --> 00:35:26.292
We need to be proud
of what we accomplish. no?

798
00:35:26.292 --> 00:35:28.420
And proud of each other as well.

799
00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:33.967
Thank you.

800
00:35:50.025 --> 00:35:51.443
This way. please.

801
00:36:10.503 --> 00:36:11.796
Mm!

802
00:36:11.796 --> 00:36:13.423
Is that Ouzo I smell?

803
00:36:13.423 --> 00:36:15.008
Good nose.

804
00:36:15.008 --> 00:36:17.010
Ah... thank you!

805
00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:19.304
Mm.

806
00:36:19.304 --> 00:36:21.306
Aw. did I wake you up?

807
00:36:21.306 --> 00:36:23.475
Yeah.

808
00:36:23.475 --> 00:36:25.435
Well... I have a theory.
You want to hear it?

809
00:36:25.435 --> 00:36:27.062
- Of course.
- Okay.

810
00:36:27.062 --> 00:36:29.022
So I saw
Tessa and Colin in town

811
00:36:29.022 --> 00:36:31.441
and they were very friendly.

812
00:36:31.441 --> 00:36:33.818
Well. they are
very friendly people.

813
00:36:33.818 --> 00:36:37.280
No. I mean friendly
with a capital "F".

814
00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.240
Ooh. capital-"F" friendly?

815
00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:41.284
- So...
- Hmm.

816
00:36:41.284 --> 00:36:43.828
Who has keys to Colin's room
and to our room?

817
00:36:43.828 --> 00:36:44.996
Tessa!

818
00:36:44.996 --> 00:36:46.414
And if she likes Colin.

819
00:36:46.414 --> 00:36:50.502
maybe she thinks the veil
will exert its power?

820
00:36:50.502 --> 00:36:51.753
I like where
you're going with this.

821
00:36:51.753 --> 00:36:52.837
- Mm-hmm. right?
- All right.

822
00:36:52.837 --> 00:36:54.631
Hello.

823
00:36:54.631 --> 00:36:56.841
I am Headmaster Papadopoulos.

824
00:36:56.841 --> 00:36:58.927
and I run
the boys' academy here in town.

825
00:36:58.927 --> 00:37:00.512
- Oh! Hello.
- Hi.

826
00:37:00.512 --> 00:37:02.263
- Nick. Nice to--
- I'll get right to the point.

827
00:37:02.263 --> 00:37:04.849
Please do not give
my students presents.

828
00:37:04.849 --> 00:37:06.518
Do you mean the art set
that I got for--

829
00:37:06.518 --> 00:37:08.395
Leo was nearly expelled

830
00:37:08.395 --> 00:37:10.438
because I was certain
he stole that art set.

831
00:37:10.438 --> 00:37:11.690
Well. I'm sorry.

832
00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:14.192
but that seems like
your mistake. not Leo's.

833
00:37:14.192 --> 00:37:16.611
Ma'am. With all due respect.

834
00:37:16.611 --> 00:37:18.947
if you want to help my students.

835
00:37:18.947 --> 00:37:21.991
we have a proper way
to make donations.

836
00:37:21.991 --> 00:37:26.246
If you can't do that.
please leave my boys alone.

837
00:37:26.246 --> 00:37:28.581
Is that clear?

838
00:37:30.625 --> 00:37:33.211
Ahem.

839
00:37:33.211 --> 00:37:34.754
Yeah. that's perfectly clear.

840
00:37:36.006 --> 00:37:37.465
Now let me be clear.

841
00:37:37.465 --> 00:37:39.551
Please don't ever
use that tone of voice

842
00:37:39.551 --> 00:37:41.386
with my wife again. okay?

843
00:37:41.386 --> 00:37:43.013
Have a nice day.

844
00:37:51.938 --> 00:37:54.399
You tried to warn me.
and I didn't listen. I'm sorry.

845
00:37:54.399 --> 00:37:55.400
Ah. it's okay.

846
00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:56.568
It's not okay!

847
00:37:56.568 --> 00:37:57.986
What if I had
gotten Leo expelled?

848
00:37:57.986 --> 00:37:59.362
Oh. come on.

849
00:37:59.362 --> 00:38:01.573
Do you really think a kid
that parkours himself

850
00:38:01.573 --> 00:38:03.491
through the window every night
just as the bell rings

851
00:38:03.491 --> 00:38:05.452
isn't in trouble
on the regular?

852
00:38:05.452 --> 00:38:07.412
You did get all "Mr. Tough Guy"
on that headmaster.

853
00:38:07.412 --> 00:38:09.289
Hey. he deserved it. eh?

854
00:38:09.289 --> 00:38:11.624
It started to make
my knees a little weak.

855
00:38:11.624 --> 00:38:13.293
It's a good thing
I'm here to catch you.

856
00:38:13.293 --> 00:38:15.086
My hero.

857
00:38:15.086 --> 00:38:16.963
Mm.

858
00:38:21.676 --> 00:38:24.596
I just feel terrible
that I got Leo in trouble.

859
00:38:24.596 --> 00:38:26.973
I think it's sweet
that you're worried about him.

860
00:38:26.973 --> 00:38:28.641
Just like a Mama Bear!

861
00:38:28.641 --> 00:38:30.560
Okay. let's not
get carried away here.

862
00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:31.895
In the "plus" column.

863
00:38:31.895 --> 00:38:34.939
Nick's <i>pastitsio</i>
was delicious last night.

864
00:38:34.939 --> 00:38:36.107
I thought you two
were on your honeymoon.

865
00:38:36.107 --> 00:38:37.484
Why is he cooking?

866
00:38:37.484 --> 00:38:39.903
Yeah! What happened
to you two not working?

867
00:38:39.903 --> 00:38:42.864
We decided
that it doesn't count as work.

868
00:38:42.864 --> 00:38:43.782
<i>Yeah. right.</i>

869
00:38:43.782 --> 00:38:45.367
<i>Wh-- Daniel. no-no-- whoa!</i>

870
00:38:45.367 --> 00:38:46.242
<i>I gotta go.
Love you guys. bye!</i>

871
00:38:46.242 --> 00:38:47.619
<i>Me too.</i>

872
00:38:47.619 --> 00:38:48.828
<i>Check out my channel.
my new video's up!</i>

873
00:38:48.828 --> 00:38:49.579
I will!

874
00:38:49.579 --> 00:38:51.289
Love you. Mwah!

875
00:38:51.289 --> 00:38:52.791
I know her!

876
00:38:52.791 --> 00:38:54.959
That's "Everyone's Favorite
Art Historian".

877
00:38:54.959 --> 00:38:57.128
Yeah! Yeah.
that's one of my best friends.

878
00:38:57.128 --> 00:38:58.588
Really?

879
00:38:58.588 --> 00:39:00.006
Tell her. please.
thank you from me.

880
00:39:00.006 --> 00:39:02.342
I'm learning about art
from her videos.

881
00:39:02.342 --> 00:39:04.594
Aw. she'll love to hear that.

882
00:39:04.594 --> 00:39:06.680
But you're also learning art
in school. right?

883
00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:09.516
"There is no money
in art. Leo.

884
00:39:09.516 --> 00:39:12.477
"You're wasting your time. Leo!

885
00:39:12.477 --> 00:39:15.355
Do more maths. Leo!"

886
00:39:15.355 --> 00:39:16.815
Well. I'm really sorry

887
00:39:16.815 --> 00:39:18.566
that I got you in trouble
with your headmaster.

888
00:39:18.566 --> 00:39:21.861
I'm always in trouble
with my headmaster.

889
00:39:21.861 --> 00:39:23.321
I know!

890
00:39:23.321 --> 00:39:25.824
You should ask your friend
to do a video at our school.

891
00:39:27.367 --> 00:39:30.995
We have a. you know. a jug--
like an urn--

892
00:39:30.995 --> 00:39:32.872
with a drawing on it.
from long ago.

893
00:39:32.872 --> 00:39:35.041
and we think maybe
it's Leonidas.

894
00:39:35.041 --> 00:39:37.335
The first one. not me.

895
00:39:37.335 --> 00:39:39.671
Your friend could do a video
about that.

896
00:39:39.671 --> 00:39:41.673
and people would want
to watch it.

897
00:39:41.673 --> 00:39:43.883
and they'd give money
to the school.

898
00:39:43.883 --> 00:39:47.679
and Headmaster Papadopoulos
would like me more.

899
00:39:49.305 --> 00:39:51.433
That is a great idea.

900
00:39:51.433 --> 00:39:53.018
and I'm sure Emma would love
to do it.

901
00:39:53.018 --> 00:39:55.687
but she has a little girl
and she lives in Italy.

902
00:39:55.687 --> 00:39:58.356
and I just don't know
that that would work out.

903
00:39:58.356 --> 00:40:01.234
But you could ask...

904
00:40:01.234 --> 00:40:02.235
couldn't you?

905
00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:05.280
Please?

906
00:40:23.089 --> 00:40:23.923
Oh! Hi.

907
00:40:23.923 --> 00:40:25.050
Hi.

908
00:40:28.136 --> 00:40:29.846
Does the wedding veil

909
00:40:29.846 --> 00:40:31.598
have other skills
besides finding love--

910
00:40:31.598 --> 00:40:33.224
teleportation. perhaps?

911
00:40:33.224 --> 00:40:35.310
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.

912
00:40:46.696 --> 00:40:49.449
So. I read about
this hike up to this monastery--

913
00:40:49.449 --> 00:40:50.575
it's about
a four-hour round trip.

914
00:40:50.575 --> 00:40:52.327
You interested?

915
00:40:52.327 --> 00:40:53.828
No. but that works out

916
00:40:53.828 --> 00:40:56.414
with my plans for the morning perfectly.

917
00:40:56.414 --> 00:40:57.832
Oh. are you going sleuthing?
Hmm?

918
00:40:57.832 --> 00:40:59.459
"The case of
the transporting veil"?

919
00:40:59.459 --> 00:41:01.044
Exactly!

920
00:41:01.044 --> 00:41:03.588
I'd be happy to be
the Watson to your Sherlock.

921
00:41:03.588 --> 00:41:05.256
Oh. The Danno to my McGarrett?

922
00:41:05.256 --> 00:41:06.549
Nice! Yeah.

923
00:41:06.549 --> 00:41:07.759
The Nick to your Nora.

924
00:41:07.759 --> 00:41:09.511
I see what you did there.

925
00:41:14.557 --> 00:41:16.559
Well. good morning. everyone.

926
00:41:16.559 --> 00:41:17.977
Good morning!

927
00:41:17.977 --> 00:41:19.270
Hi.
There's coffee. if you'd like.

928
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:20.271
Oh. no. thank you.

929
00:41:20.271 --> 00:41:21.815
We're heading out
on a hike today.

930
00:41:21.815 --> 00:41:23.942
Yup. Yeah. Big. old hike--
gone for a couple of hours.

931
00:41:23.942 --> 00:41:25.527
Mm-hmm. Yep. we'll be
gone for a while.

932
00:41:25.527 --> 00:41:26.611
So. see you later. Bye.

933
00:41:26.611 --> 00:41:28.655
- Bye.
- Bye.

934
00:41:38.873 --> 00:41:39.916
Think they bought it?

935
00:41:39.916 --> 00:41:41.126
- Oh. yeah. totally.
- Yeah.

936
00:41:41.126 --> 00:41:41.960
- Mm.
- Mwah.

937
00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:43.128
- Have a good hike.
- Okay.

938
00:41:43.128 --> 00:41:44.129
Love you.

939
00:41:46.506 --> 00:41:47.966
Ah. well...

940
00:41:47.966 --> 00:41:49.592
I think I might
go back upstairs

941
00:41:49.592 --> 00:41:51.052
and have a nice little nap.

942
00:41:51.052 --> 00:41:52.971
Okay.

943
00:41:58.184 --> 00:42:00.061
Aye-yi-yi!
- Tessa!

944
00:42:28.131 --> 00:42:29.299
Oh.

945
00:42:29.299 --> 00:42:31.509
What are you doing here?

946
00:42:31.509 --> 00:42:34.679
Oh! Where am I?
I'm so confused.

947
00:42:34.679 --> 00:42:37.307
Oh! Am I sleepwalking?

948
00:42:37.307 --> 00:42:38.433
Okay.

949
00:42:38.433 --> 00:42:39.768
I might have bought that

950
00:42:39.768 --> 00:42:43.271
if I hadn't seen you
pick that lock like a pro.

951
00:42:43.271 --> 00:42:45.023
Oh.

952
00:42:45.023 --> 00:42:46.358
I think maybe
we should have a little chat.

953
00:42:53.031 --> 00:42:55.992
Oh. it's beautiful here.
isn't it?

954
00:42:55.992 --> 00:42:58.370
It was my grandson's idea
to come here.

955
00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:01.456
His parents aren't much
for traveling. but...

956
00:43:01.456 --> 00:43:04.209
oh. Colin and I have had
such wonderful adventures

957
00:43:04.209 --> 00:43:05.585
since I retired.

958
00:43:05.585 --> 00:43:06.961
Retired from what?

959
00:43:06.961 --> 00:43:10.340
Oh. you know...
British government.

960
00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:11.508
"Home Office".

961
00:43:11.508 --> 00:43:12.717
Picking locks?

962
00:43:13.968 --> 00:43:17.389
Well. there was a time
when the wars were cold.

963
00:43:17.389 --> 00:43:21.226
and people with certain skills
and temperaments

964
00:43:21.226 --> 00:43:22.477
were useful.

965
00:43:22.477 --> 00:43:24.896
Well. may I say
thank you for your service?

966
00:43:24.896 --> 00:43:27.482
Well. one does what one can
with what one has.

967
00:43:29.025 --> 00:43:30.151
Okay.

968
00:43:30.151 --> 00:43:32.112
So why were you
trying to steal my veil?

969
00:43:32.112 --> 00:43:34.823
Colin is ready to settle down

970
00:43:34.823 --> 00:43:37.117
and Tessa is exactly
the kind of girl

971
00:43:37.117 --> 00:43:38.910
I would have chosen
for him.

972
00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:41.329
And if I'm being honest...

973
00:43:41.329 --> 00:43:44.666
since I intend to play
with my great-grandbabies.

974
00:43:44.666 --> 00:43:47.544
I'd rather he fell in love
with someone in a warm climate.

975
00:43:47.544 --> 00:43:49.295
So you believe in the veil?

976
00:43:49.295 --> 00:43:50.547
Oh. my dear!

977
00:43:50.547 --> 00:43:52.966
I've lived a long time
and seen many things.

978
00:43:52.966 --> 00:43:54.968
Believing in the veil
doesn't even break a sweat.

979
00:43:56.177 --> 00:43:58.179
Well. the legend does say

980
00:43:58.179 --> 00:44:01.349
whoever is "in <i>possession</i>
of the veil..."

981
00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:04.394
And Colin was definitely
in possession of the veil

982
00:44:04.394 --> 00:44:05.979
when he first met Tessa.

983
00:44:05.979 --> 00:44:07.063
Well. okay then.

984
00:44:07.063 --> 00:44:09.315
Your work here is done. 007.

985
00:44:09.315 --> 00:44:11.568
You don't need to keep
breaking into my room.

986
00:44:11.568 --> 00:44:13.486
Old habits die hard!

987
00:44:18.283 --> 00:44:19.868
- Ouzo?
- Ouzo.

988
00:44:19.868 --> 00:44:21.578
- Cheers. Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

989
00:44:23.538 --> 00:44:26.041
You know what I was thinking
today up at the monastery?

990
00:44:26.041 --> 00:44:28.126
I hope it's not
that you want to become a monk?

991
00:44:28.126 --> 00:44:29.461
No!

992
00:44:29.461 --> 00:44:30.754
Emphatically. no.

993
00:44:32.047 --> 00:44:34.257
Um. I was thinking
I really miss cooking.

994
00:44:35.383 --> 00:44:36.968
What do you mean?

995
00:44:36.968 --> 00:44:39.137
You spend all day and all night
at those restaurants.

996
00:44:39.137 --> 00:44:40.138
I know...

997
00:44:40.138 --> 00:44:41.890
but I don't do any cooking anymore.

998
00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:43.850
I'm just dealing with vendors

999
00:44:43.850 --> 00:44:46.227
and shipping and refrigeration
and more vendors.

1000
00:44:46.227 --> 00:44:48.271
I mean. don't get me wrong--
I love what I do.

1001
00:44:48.271 --> 00:44:50.398
But I just really miss.
you know.

1002
00:44:50.398 --> 00:44:53.401
just cooking for the customers and...

1003
00:44:53.401 --> 00:44:55.028
and for you.

1004
00:44:55.028 --> 00:44:58.490
Well. how do
we make that happen?

1005
00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:02.744
I don't know...
but I want to figure it out.

1006
00:45:02.744 --> 00:45:03.870
We're gonna figure it out.

1007
00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:06.081
- Okay.
- Just the two of us.

1008
00:45:06.081 --> 00:45:07.791
- Yeah.
- Surprise!

1009
00:45:07.791 --> 00:45:09.668
Emma?

1010
00:45:09.668 --> 00:45:11.169
How are you here?

1011
00:45:11.169 --> 00:45:13.004
I know I'm crashing
your honeymoon.

1012
00:45:13.004 --> 00:45:16.091
which is maybe
the tackiest thing ever...

1013
00:45:16.091 --> 00:45:18.927
but you texted me
about that Grecian urn.

1014
00:45:18.927 --> 00:45:21.721
and I'm only two hours away. so...

1015
00:45:21.721 --> 00:45:22.764
I can't believe you came!

1016
00:45:22.764 --> 00:45:24.933
What--
What Grecian urn?

1017
00:45:24.933 --> 00:45:26.434
Oh. apparently.
they found one at Leo's school.

1018
00:45:26.434 --> 00:45:28.353
The school with the headmaster
who yelled at you?

1019
00:45:28.353 --> 00:45:29.562
- Exactly.
- Who yelled at you?

1020
00:45:29.562 --> 00:45:30.522
Avery!

1021
00:45:30.522 --> 00:45:32.273
Hi!

1022
00:45:32.273 --> 00:45:34.776
I couldn't let her
crash your honeymoon without me!

1023
00:45:34.776 --> 00:45:35.694
Of course not!

1024
00:45:40.949 --> 00:45:42.784
I really like Leo.

1025
00:45:42.784 --> 00:45:44.744
He's talented and funny.
and sweet.

1026
00:45:44.744 --> 00:45:47.247
and he always has
a side hustle going.

1027
00:45:48.415 --> 00:45:50.417
You seem really taken
with this kid.

1028
00:45:50.417 --> 00:45:52.794
Oh. Well. I showed you
his work. right?

1029
00:45:52.794 --> 00:45:54.254
He's really good!

1030
00:45:54.254 --> 00:45:56.464
And I just want to help him.
if I can. that's all.

1031
00:45:56.464 --> 00:45:59.968
But that means facing
the dreaded headmaster?

1032
00:45:59.968 --> 00:46:01.386
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1033
00:46:01.386 --> 00:46:02.679
Exactly.

1034
00:46:02.679 --> 00:46:05.181
All right. Break time's over.
Let's go. ladies.

1035
00:46:05.181 --> 00:46:07.392
All right. Back to it.

1036
00:46:16.818 --> 00:46:18.278
I called
and the school secretary told me

1037
00:46:18.278 --> 00:46:20.697
he brings the kids up here
once every month.

1038
00:46:20.697 --> 00:46:22.532
and today is that day.

1039
00:46:26.244 --> 00:46:27.412
Wow...

1040
00:46:39.674 --> 00:46:41.551
Yeah. Wow.

1041
00:46:42.886 --> 00:46:44.512
Can you believe
we're actually up here?

1042
00:46:44.512 --> 00:46:47.474
It's like we're standing
in the middle of history.

1043
00:46:47.474 --> 00:46:48.975
It's just unreal.

1044
00:46:48.975 --> 00:46:50.685
It's amazing that these places
are still here.

1045
00:46:50.685 --> 00:46:52.103
you know.
centuries later.

1046
00:46:52.103 --> 00:46:54.022
It's undeniably...

1047
00:46:54.022 --> 00:46:55.482
selfie time.

1048
00:46:55.482 --> 00:46:56.608
Yes!

1049
00:46:56.608 --> 00:46:57.567
Here. let me take it.

1050
00:46:57.567 --> 00:46:58.860
No. honey. get in.

1051
00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:00.028
We crashed your honeymoon--

1052
00:47:00.028 --> 00:47:01.112
the least you can do
is crash our selfie.

1053
00:47:01.112 --> 00:47:02.489
- Yeah.
- Okay. fine.

1054
00:47:02.489 --> 00:47:04.824
And he's got longer arms.
it's gonna be great.

1055
00:47:06.076 --> 00:47:07.952
Everyone say... "Acropolis!"

1056
00:47:07.952 --> 00:47:09.829
Acropolis!

1057
00:47:11.664 --> 00:47:13.750
- Aw. so great.
- Wait.

1058
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:14.876
That's him!

1059
00:47:14.876 --> 00:47:16.252
Over this way.

1060
00:47:16.252 --> 00:47:17.545
Come on!

1061
00:47:17.545 --> 00:47:18.797
Wait. wait. wait.
What're you gonna say to him?

1062
00:47:18.797 --> 00:47:19.923
I don't know. I'll think
of something on the way.

1063
00:47:19.923 --> 00:47:22.217
Come on!

1064
00:47:23.927 --> 00:47:24.969
Great.

1065
00:47:24.969 --> 00:47:27.097
More steps.

1066
00:47:30.725 --> 00:47:32.102
Mr. Papadopoulos? Hi.

1067
00:47:32.102 --> 00:47:33.395
Excuse me.

1068
00:47:33.395 --> 00:47:35.647
Sorry.
Um. do you remember me?

1069
00:47:35.647 --> 00:47:37.482
I-I wondered if you have
a moment to talk?

1070
00:47:45.198 --> 00:47:47.575
And these videos
are successful?

1071
00:47:47.575 --> 00:47:49.077
They are.

1072
00:47:49.077 --> 00:47:51.371
In fact. some of the places
I've visited

1073
00:47:51.371 --> 00:47:54.249
even started charging
a small entrance fee. so...

1074
00:47:54.249 --> 00:47:55.625
it's been beneficial
to their budgets as well.

1075
00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:59.129
Did Leo put you up to this?

1076
00:47:59.129 --> 00:48:00.839
Not exactly.

1077
00:48:00.839 --> 00:48:02.757
But he did ask
to be in the video.

1078
00:48:02.757 --> 00:48:03.967
Of course. he has.

1079
00:48:03.967 --> 00:48:05.427
And knowing Leo.

1080
00:48:05.427 --> 00:48:08.013
I'm sure he also requested
a fee for his services?

1081
00:48:08.013 --> 00:48:09.389
Just a small one.

1082
00:48:09.389 --> 00:48:11.641
But we would need permission
from his parents

1083
00:48:11.641 --> 00:48:12.767
in order to allow it.

1084
00:48:13.977 --> 00:48:15.103
You don't know. then?

1085
00:48:15.103 --> 00:48:16.229
Know what?

1086
00:48:16.229 --> 00:48:17.772
He lives at the school
full-time.

1087
00:48:17.772 --> 00:48:19.649
Leo has no family.

1088
00:48:20.692 --> 00:48:23.319
I didn't know.

1089
00:48:23.319 --> 00:48:26.448
That's why I asked you
not to encourage his art.

1090
00:48:26.448 --> 00:48:29.951
The boys who live at our school
don't need to study art.

1091
00:48:29.951 --> 00:48:33.455
They need marketable skills--
such engineering or a trade--

1092
00:48:33.455 --> 00:48:35.373
so they can work
as soon as they leave school.

1093
00:48:35.373 --> 00:48:39.294
Running and art
are lovely hobbies.

1094
00:48:39.294 --> 00:48:41.963
but neither will support him
when he grows up.

1095
00:48:41.963 --> 00:48:43.298
Well. with
all due respect. sir--

1096
00:48:43.298 --> 00:48:44.841
we all went to art school

1097
00:48:44.841 --> 00:48:46.926
and now we work
in that industry.

1098
00:48:46.926 --> 00:48:47.761
Quite successfully.

1099
00:48:47.761 --> 00:48:49.429
Yes...

1100
00:48:49.429 --> 00:48:52.098
but you all likely
had safety nets. didn't you?

1101
00:48:52.098 --> 00:48:53.975
Someone to help.
if you needed it?

1102
00:48:53.975 --> 00:48:57.187
Um... we did. yes.

1103
00:48:58.188 --> 00:49:00.482
Leo has no one.

1104
00:49:00.482 --> 00:49:02.901
If he doesn't learn a skill now.

1105
00:49:02.901 --> 00:49:04.986
he'll still be drawing pictures
for tourists down on the docks

1106
00:49:04.986 --> 00:49:06.237
when he's 40.

1107
00:49:06.237 --> 00:49:10.116
Surely. you must see
I want more for him.

1108
00:49:10.116 --> 00:49:11.826
Yes. I do see that.

1109
00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:15.997
What is he saving up for?

1110
00:49:19.751 --> 00:49:21.711
He has an uncle in Athens.

1111
00:49:21.711 --> 00:49:23.463
Not a real uncle--

1112
00:49:23.463 --> 00:49:26.508
a man who used to live
in the downstairs unit.

1113
00:49:26.508 --> 00:49:30.720
and this man would watch Leo
when his mother worked.

1114
00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:34.724
It was one of those families
people make when they need to.

1115
00:49:34.724 --> 00:49:35.934
What happened?

1116
00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:41.314
The uncle got forgetful
and went to a memory facility.

1117
00:49:41.314 --> 00:49:43.858
and then his mother passed.

1118
00:49:43.858 --> 00:49:45.902
which is how Leo ended up here.

1119
00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:51.825
The boy mails a drawing
to his uncle every week.

1120
00:49:51.825 --> 00:49:53.743
so some money goes to postage.

1121
00:49:53.743 --> 00:49:56.037
And the rest.

1122
00:49:56.037 --> 00:49:58.373
he is saving
to go and visit him.

1123
00:49:58.373 --> 00:49:59.416
Well. is there someone
who could take him?

1124
00:49:59.416 --> 00:50:02.460
I mean. it's only a day trip.

1125
00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:04.921
The uncle is not even likely
to even remember Leo.

1126
00:50:07.841 --> 00:50:10.385
I'm sorry. Mr. Papadopoulos.

1127
00:50:10.385 --> 00:50:13.054
I can see that you want
what's best for him.

1128
00:50:14.139 --> 00:50:16.349
I just want to help.

1129
00:50:17.559 --> 00:50:18.643
So do I.

1130
00:50:18.643 --> 00:50:21.187
And I don't want to break
that boy's heart

1131
00:50:21.187 --> 00:50:24.024
any more than
it's already been broken.

1132
00:50:24.024 --> 00:50:26.317
Good day.

1133
00:50:45.086 --> 00:50:46.796
Nick!

1134
00:50:46.796 --> 00:50:48.506
Hey. Xander.

1135
00:50:49.883 --> 00:50:51.176
Is everything okay?

1136
00:50:51.176 --> 00:50:52.802
Oh. yes.

1137
00:50:52.802 --> 00:50:54.846
Sure. Fine. Heh. You?

1138
00:50:54.846 --> 00:50:56.014
- Great.
- Good.

1139
00:50:56.014 --> 00:50:57.474
Yes.

1140
00:50:57.474 --> 00:50:59.517
Okay. I'm...
I'm gonna go to the bar.

1141
00:50:59.517 --> 00:51:01.186
Okay.

1142
00:51:01.186 --> 00:51:02.062
I forgot the cinnamon!

1143
00:51:03.688 --> 00:51:05.815
On the <i>pastitsio--</i> I realized
I forgot to add cinnamon.

1144
00:51:05.815 --> 00:51:08.360
Critical. right?
But I forget!

1145
00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:11.488
But when I looked.
the cinnamon was in there.

1146
00:51:11.488 --> 00:51:13.531
So... maybe I have
one of those elves

1147
00:51:13.531 --> 00:51:15.492
that come in the night
to fix the shoes.

1148
00:51:15.492 --> 00:51:17.243
except. for me.
they fix the food.

1149
00:51:17.243 --> 00:51:18.495
Xander...

1150
00:51:18.495 --> 00:51:19.871
Then I looked you up
on the Internet. Nick.

1151
00:51:19.871 --> 00:51:21.998
and I know
what happened to my food--

1152
00:51:21.998 --> 00:51:24.876
why it got so good!

1153
00:51:24.876 --> 00:51:26.586
All right. look.
I didn't mean to interfere.

1154
00:51:26.586 --> 00:51:28.755
I'm really sorry
that I upset you--

1155
00:51:28.755 --> 00:51:30.340
No. I'm not upset.

1156
00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:32.842
Nick. I'm terrified!

1157
00:51:32.842 --> 00:51:34.678
I'm making seafood
for eight people tonight.

1158
00:51:34.678 --> 00:51:36.554
and I don't want
to poison us all!

1159
00:51:36.554 --> 00:51:37.764
Help me.

1160
00:51:37.764 --> 00:51:40.684
Okay. Okay.

1161
00:51:40.684 --> 00:51:42.394
Ohh...

1162
00:51:44.729 --> 00:51:45.647
Oh...

1163
00:51:48.358 --> 00:51:50.985
Oh! Look at what
I got for Daniel.

1164
00:51:50.985 --> 00:51:52.237
I wonder what it says.

1165
00:51:52.237 --> 00:51:54.489
"Greetings from Greece."

1166
00:51:54.489 --> 00:51:55.532
I didn't know
you could read Greek.

1167
00:51:55.532 --> 00:51:57.200
I can't.
I can read T-shirts.

1168
00:52:00.578 --> 00:52:03.289
Trace. I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry about Leo.

1169
00:52:03.289 --> 00:52:04.791
Oh. thanks.

1170
00:52:04.791 --> 00:52:06.501
You were just trying
to do the right thing. you know?

1171
00:52:06.501 --> 00:52:07.669
It's not your fault

1172
00:52:07.669 --> 00:52:09.170
that the headmaster
doesn't agree.

1173
00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:10.588
I know. I know.

1174
00:52:10.588 --> 00:52:12.132
I just wish that there was
something I could--

1175
00:52:12.132 --> 00:52:13.758
Hello?

1176
00:52:13.758 --> 00:52:15.760
Yes.

1177
00:52:16.928 --> 00:52:19.305
Really?

1178
00:52:19.305 --> 00:52:20.557
Thank you!

1179
00:52:20.557 --> 00:52:22.350
Thank y-- thank you so much.
Mr. Papadopoulos.

1180
00:52:22.350 --> 00:52:23.560
Thank you!

1181
00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:25.353
I don't know what made him
change his mind.

1182
00:52:25.353 --> 00:52:27.147
but he did. and ladies.
we are making a video!

1183
00:52:27.147 --> 00:52:28.231
Come on!

1184
00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:33.278
Leonidas won
all three of his foot races.

1185
00:52:33.278 --> 00:52:35.530
in four separate Olympic Games.

1186
00:52:35.530 --> 00:52:38.408
The island of Rhodes
has changed a lot since his day.

1187
00:52:38.408 --> 00:52:40.660
but I think.
if you listen closely.

1188
00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:43.705
you can hear the next
Leonidas of Rhodes

1189
00:52:43.705 --> 00:52:47.459
training for his shot
at Olympic glory.

1190
00:52:49.669 --> 00:52:51.004
<i>Hey!</i>

1191
00:52:51.004 --> 00:52:52.088
Yay!

1192
00:52:52.088 --> 00:52:53.631
Whoo!

1193
00:52:53.631 --> 00:52:54.716
- Was that good?
- Put it there. buddy.

1194
00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:03.892
Dinner is served!

1195
00:53:03.892 --> 00:53:06.144
- Wow!
- Ooh!

1196
00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:11.900
Oh. thank you.

1197
00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:12.942
Hey! Leo!

1198
00:53:12.942 --> 00:53:14.194
Where are you going?

1199
00:53:14.194 --> 00:53:16.613
It's your dinnertime.

1200
00:53:16.613 --> 00:53:18.698
I should leave you alone.

1201
00:53:18.698 --> 00:53:20.158
Yeah. don't worry...

1202
00:53:20.158 --> 00:53:21.493
Nick cooked.

1203
00:53:22.952 --> 00:53:24.537
Come on!

1204
00:53:24.537 --> 00:53:25.789
Get over here.

1205
00:53:25.789 --> 00:53:27.665
Yeah.

1206
00:53:28.833 --> 00:53:29.876
There you go.

1207
00:53:29.876 --> 00:53:31.252
They'll make you
do the dishes. though.

1208
00:53:56.403 --> 00:53:58.571
Trace?

1209
00:54:02.033 --> 00:54:04.119
Tracy?

1210
00:54:09.416 --> 00:54:10.625
So...

1211
00:54:10.625 --> 00:54:12.127
you were right.

1212
00:54:12.127 --> 00:54:15.296
Waking up alone is no fun.

1213
00:54:15.296 --> 00:54:17.215
Zero stars.
Do not recommend.

1214
00:54:19.676 --> 00:54:22.512
I thought I was gonna just
come down and make a PB and J.

1215
00:54:22.512 --> 00:54:24.681
but Xander's
homemade peanut butter's

1216
00:54:24.681 --> 00:54:27.017
gone bad or something.

1217
00:54:28.143 --> 00:54:29.686
Mm. well. that's because
this is tahini.

1218
00:54:29.686 --> 00:54:32.147
Yeah. and your. uh...

1219
00:54:32.147 --> 00:54:33.857
and your "jelly" is fish eggs.

1220
00:54:33.857 --> 00:54:34.858
Ugh.

1221
00:54:34.858 --> 00:54:37.736
Ah. and that's why
I don't cook.

1222
00:54:39.821 --> 00:54:41.322
Mm.

1223
00:54:42.949 --> 00:54:44.534
My friends just showed up here.

1224
00:54:44.534 --> 00:54:45.910
crashing our honeymoon.

1225
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:48.038
and you handled it
like a champ.

1226
00:54:48.038 --> 00:54:51.166
You are seriously
the best husband in the world.

1227
00:54:51.166 --> 00:54:52.709
Mm. Wait. I-I'm sorry--
what was that last part?

1228
00:54:52.709 --> 00:54:54.377
Oh. yeah. No.
You just get it the one time.

1229
00:54:54.377 --> 00:54:55.712
Yeah.

1230
00:54:55.712 --> 00:54:57.380
I know how it is
with the three of you--

1231
00:54:57.380 --> 00:54:59.174
and they were here
before me. so...

1232
00:55:00.425 --> 00:55:02.427
Oh. what is that?

1233
00:55:02.427 --> 00:55:05.305
Oh. uh. it's just a sketch
that Leo made me.

1234
00:55:06.973 --> 00:55:08.391
- Wow!
- Yeah.

1235
00:55:08.391 --> 00:55:10.143
"Wow."

1236
00:55:10.143 --> 00:55:12.062
He's a talented kid.

1237
00:55:12.062 --> 00:55:14.981
Mm-hmm.

1238
00:55:17.442 --> 00:55:20.570
You. know. I've never seen you
so taken with a child before.

1239
00:55:20.570 --> 00:55:23.114
Usually. you keep them
at arms' length.

1240
00:55:24.574 --> 00:55:26.868
Oh. sweetheart.

1241
00:55:26.868 --> 00:55:28.244
Hey. hey. hey!

1242
00:55:28.244 --> 00:55:30.830
There's no crying on honeymoons.

1243
00:55:30.830 --> 00:55:32.707
That's baseball.

1244
00:55:32.707 --> 00:55:34.626
Okay. whatever it is...

1245
00:55:34.626 --> 00:55:36.544
come on. talk to me.

1246
00:55:36.544 --> 00:55:37.796
What's going on?

1247
00:55:37.796 --> 00:55:41.341
I just want to help him.
you know?

1248
00:55:41.341 --> 00:55:45.011
And... I get it.
he has his own life.

1249
00:55:45.011 --> 00:55:47.430
I get that it's none
of our business.

1250
00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:49.516
and that it's totally not me. but...

1251
00:55:49.516 --> 00:55:52.268
but still...

1252
00:55:52.268 --> 00:55:54.604
You want to go take him
to see his uncle. don't you?

1253
00:55:54.604 --> 00:55:56.481
The one
who doesn't remember him?

1254
00:55:56.481 --> 00:55:58.566
Okay. even if
that's what happens.

1255
00:55:58.566 --> 00:56:00.026
maybe that would help Leo.

1256
00:56:00.026 --> 00:56:03.029
maybe he could just
finally move on. you know?

1257
00:56:06.491 --> 00:56:10.787
You remember when I said
that art kit was a bad idea?

1258
00:56:10.787 --> 00:56:12.997
I feel like this
is kinda like that.

1259
00:56:15.667 --> 00:56:18.044
This is his gift.

1260
00:56:19.212 --> 00:56:20.797
It's all he has...

1261
00:56:20.797 --> 00:56:23.925
and he shared it with me.

1262
00:56:26.261 --> 00:56:27.762
And it's beautiful.

1263
00:56:29.723 --> 00:56:33.351
What am I supposed to do.
just leave?

1264
00:56:33.351 --> 00:56:36.438
"Well. thanks. kid!
Good luck with your life!"

1265
00:56:38.815 --> 00:56:41.067
It just doesn't
feel right to me.

1266
00:56:44.029 --> 00:56:46.197
Well. you have to get
permission from the headmaster.

1267
00:56:47.532 --> 00:56:49.451
That seems highly unlikely.

1268
00:56:49.451 --> 00:56:52.662
I know.

1269
00:56:52.662 --> 00:56:54.914
I just have to try.

1270
00:57:03.506 --> 00:57:05.383
Good morning!

1271
00:57:05.383 --> 00:57:07.510
Oh. good morning.
Lady Dalton.

1272
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:09.679
Uh... this came for you.

1273
00:57:09.679 --> 00:57:11.806
Ah! Excellent.
Thank you.

1274
00:57:11.806 --> 00:57:13.850
I told Xander I'd go into town

1275
00:57:13.850 --> 00:57:15.435
to pick up some supplies
for dinner tonight.

1276
00:57:15.435 --> 00:57:16.519
What are you doing today. Nan?

1277
00:57:16.519 --> 00:57:19.022
First. I plan
to finish my book.

1278
00:57:19.022 --> 00:57:22.901
Then I'm going
to man the desk for Tessa here.

1279
00:57:22.901 --> 00:57:25.111
so that she can go into town
and have a nice lunch.

1280
00:57:25.111 --> 00:57:26.071
Oh--

1281
00:57:26.071 --> 00:57:27.864
And you
are going to escort her.

1282
00:57:27.864 --> 00:57:29.741
You can do your shopping
on the way back.

1283
00:57:29.741 --> 00:57:33.203
And I am not entertaining
any questions on this topic.

1284
00:57:33.203 --> 00:57:35.413
Thank you.

1285
00:58:03.149 --> 00:58:04.109
Hey. Leo.

1286
00:58:04.109 --> 00:58:05.026
Hi!

1287
00:58:05.026 --> 00:58:06.444
Want to go
for a jog with me?

1288
00:58:06.444 --> 00:58:07.987
- Yeah.
- All right. let's do it.

1289
00:58:07.987 --> 00:58:09.906
I'll go slow
so you can keep up.

1290
00:58:19.165 --> 00:58:21.668
I've got a cramp.
Ho. ho. Oh!

1291
00:58:23.336 --> 00:58:26.548
You know. the shameful part is.
I know you're holding back.

1292
00:58:26.548 --> 00:58:27.966
Don't be ashamed. Nick.

1293
00:58:27.966 --> 00:58:30.218
You run really fast...

1294
00:58:30.218 --> 00:58:31.928
for an old man.

1295
00:58:31.928 --> 00:58:34.264
Who you calling old man.
spring chicken?

1296
00:58:34.264 --> 00:58:35.890
Sit down.

1297
00:58:37.017 --> 00:58:38.643
Was your mom a runner?

1298
00:58:38.643 --> 00:58:40.103
Yeah.

1299
00:58:40.103 --> 00:58:41.896
She ran all the way
through school.

1300
00:58:41.896 --> 00:58:45.316
That's why
she named me Leonidas.

1301
00:58:45.316 --> 00:58:47.110
My uncle says he ran. too.

1302
00:58:47.110 --> 00:58:48.319
Yeah?

1303
00:58:48.319 --> 00:58:51.239
He liked the. uh...
the. uh. little jumps.

1304
00:58:51.239 --> 00:58:52.741
The little jumps?

1305
00:58:52.741 --> 00:58:54.284
Oh. the hurdles?

1306
00:58:54.284 --> 00:58:56.077
Yes! "Hurdles".

1307
00:58:56.077 --> 00:58:58.705
Nice. That's the uncle
you want to go see?

1308
00:58:58.705 --> 00:59:01.207
He doesn't remember
things anymore.

1309
00:59:02.917 --> 00:59:04.794
I know you want
to go see him.

1310
00:59:04.794 --> 00:59:07.922
but. people.
when they lose their memory.

1311
00:59:07.922 --> 00:59:08.715
sometimes.
they don't recognize--

1312
00:59:08.715 --> 00:59:10.050
I know.

1313
00:59:10.050 --> 00:59:12.594
He might not
remember me anymore.

1314
00:59:14.179 --> 00:59:15.680
Are you sure
you're prepared for that?

1315
00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:17.557
I am.

1316
00:59:17.557 --> 00:59:19.642
Because...

1317
00:59:19.642 --> 00:59:23.313
if he doesn't remember me.
that's okay.

1318
00:59:23.313 --> 00:59:26.107
I remember him.

1319
00:59:26.107 --> 00:59:29.069
and he gets a visit
from a nice stranger.

1320
00:59:30.362 --> 00:59:31.905
Come on. Nick. we've got
a kilometer and a half to go.

1321
00:59:31.905 --> 00:59:33.365
Wait. wait. wait. hold on.

1322
00:59:33.365 --> 00:59:34.491
My shoelace is untied.

1323
00:59:34.491 --> 00:59:35.867
- Oh--
- Yeah.

1324
00:59:40.288 --> 00:59:42.749
I still can't believe
we crashed your honeymoon.

1325
00:59:42.749 --> 00:59:43.792
Are you kidding?
I can.

1326
00:59:43.792 --> 00:59:45.168
Totally on-brand!

1327
00:59:45.168 --> 00:59:47.170
Oh. and we're gonna have
to come back for the wedding

1328
00:59:47.170 --> 00:59:48.838
if the legend of the veil continues.

1329
00:59:48.838 --> 00:59:50.006
Oh. Avery!

1330
00:59:50.006 --> 00:59:52.008
Hey. um. I meant to ask you.

1331
00:59:52.008 --> 00:59:54.219
is Peter still involved
in children's art programs?

1332
00:59:54.219 --> 00:59:55.136
Sure.

1333
00:59:55.136 --> 00:59:56.638
Are you thinking
about for Leo?

1334
00:59:56.638 --> 00:59:58.223
I am.

1335
00:59:58.223 --> 00:59:59.933
I was hoping maybe we could
find him a better school--

1336
00:59:59.933 --> 01:00:01.101
one that's right for him.

1337
01:00:01.101 --> 01:00:03.395
Maybe something in Athens?

1338
01:00:03.395 --> 01:00:05.355
And Nick and I
could help with the costs.

1339
01:00:05.355 --> 01:00:07.232
I'll definitely ask Peter
to look around.

1340
01:00:07.232 --> 01:00:08.775
but have you
talked to Nick about this?

1341
01:00:08.775 --> 01:00:10.777
Not yet.

1342
01:00:10.777 --> 01:00:13.655
Well. don't you think
you should?

1343
01:00:13.655 --> 01:00:15.073
It's kind of
a couple's decision--

1344
01:00:15.073 --> 01:00:16.908
not really something you do
on your own. right?

1345
01:00:16.908 --> 01:00:18.827
I'm just working up
the nerve. okay. Emma?

1346
01:00:20.245 --> 01:00:22.414
Excuse me. ladies.
but we really must get going.

1347
01:00:22.414 --> 01:00:23.915
Of course. yes.

1348
01:00:23.915 --> 01:00:24.874
Oh. thank you so much.

1349
01:00:24.874 --> 01:00:26.334
Here.

1350
01:00:26.334 --> 01:00:27.335
Oh!

1351
01:00:27.335 --> 01:00:28.461
Thank you.

1352
01:00:29.754 --> 01:00:31.381
Thanks.

1353
01:00:31.381 --> 01:00:33.049
The long goodbye!

1354
01:00:33.049 --> 01:00:34.426
I hate this part.

1355
01:00:37.429 --> 01:00:38.471
Mwah. mwah!

1356
01:00:40.765 --> 01:00:42.434
So. when do you want to go?

1357
01:00:42.434 --> 01:00:44.269
Where?

1358
01:00:44.269 --> 01:00:47.355
To go talk to Leo's headmaster
about visiting his uncle.

1359
01:00:48.481 --> 01:00:49.733
How did you know?

1360
01:00:49.733 --> 01:00:51.651
I know my wife.

1361
01:00:56.781 --> 01:00:58.366
I am pleased with the video.

1362
01:00:58.366 --> 01:01:01.453
We have already had
a number of inquiries.

1363
01:01:01.453 --> 01:01:03.246
Oh. good. I'm thrilled.

1364
01:01:03.246 --> 01:01:05.290
I will be sure to let
my friend know.

1365
01:01:05.290 --> 01:01:09.127
And now I believe
you want something else from me?

1366
01:01:10.587 --> 01:01:12.255
Yes.

1367
01:01:12.255 --> 01:01:13.506
The uncle?

1368
01:01:13.506 --> 01:01:14.758
The uncle.

1369
01:01:18.595 --> 01:01:20.638
Sir. my wife has
about a hundred reasons

1370
01:01:20.638 --> 01:01:22.015
why this would be a good idea.

1371
01:01:22.015 --> 01:01:23.808
and she would happily
pitch 'em all to you.

1372
01:01:23.808 --> 01:01:25.268
But at the end of the day.

1373
01:01:25.268 --> 01:01:27.270
what's most important is.

1374
01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:28.646
would this trip
be helpful to Leo?

1375
01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:37.155
Every week.

1376
01:01:37.155 --> 01:01:39.407
for two years now.

1377
01:01:39.407 --> 01:01:42.118
Leo sends this uncle a picture.

1378
01:01:42.118 --> 01:01:44.579
He never replies.

1379
01:01:44.579 --> 01:01:46.956
- He might not even still--
- Excuse me.

1380
01:01:46.956 --> 01:01:50.001
But I think this trip
is about Leo's heart...

1381
01:01:50.001 --> 01:01:52.420
it's not about
the uncle's memory.

1382
01:01:54.964 --> 01:01:57.133
Yes. I see.

1383
01:02:00.595 --> 01:02:02.013
Okay.

1384
01:02:02.013 --> 01:02:06.101
Yes. you may take him to Athens
to see his uncle.

1385
01:02:06.101 --> 01:02:09.104
Thank you so much.
Mr. Papadopoulos.

1386
01:02:09.104 --> 01:02:10.855
I fear it won't go
as you hope.

1387
01:02:10.855 --> 01:02:13.441
Well. I hope
it won't go as you fear.

1388
01:02:13.441 --> 01:02:14.567
Yes!

1389
01:02:14.567 --> 01:02:15.735
So when can we go?

1390
01:02:15.735 --> 01:02:17.070
Leo!

1391
01:02:17.070 --> 01:02:19.280
What did we discuss
about eavesdropping?

1392
01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:22.158
I'm sorry. Mr. Papadopoulos.

1393
01:02:25.870 --> 01:02:26.996
So when can we go?

1394
01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:34.462
Honey!

1395
01:02:34.462 --> 01:02:36.756
We told Pen
we would meet her and Leo

1396
01:02:36.756 --> 01:02:37.882
at the dock at 10:00!

1397
01:02:37.882 --> 01:02:39.300
Come on!

1398
01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:41.136
Yeah.
I'm coming. I'm coming.

1399
01:02:41.136 --> 01:02:42.220
Good luck in Athens.

1400
01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:43.513
Oh. thank you so much.

1401
01:02:43.513 --> 01:02:45.557
Oh. look at you--
doing a little gardening.

1402
01:02:45.557 --> 01:02:47.892
Oh. uh. yeah. well.
you know. it needed doing. so.

1403
01:02:47.892 --> 01:02:49.269
Uh-huh.

1404
01:02:49.269 --> 01:02:51.104
- Nick. come on!
- Ah. okay. okay!

1405
01:02:51.104 --> 01:02:54.274
Just hope there's not
any donkeys out there.

1406
01:02:55.525 --> 01:02:57.277
Donkeys?

1407
01:02:59.946 --> 01:03:01.406
Hi.

1408
01:03:01.406 --> 01:03:02.782
Oh. hey.

1409
01:03:02.782 --> 01:03:03.742
Want to have a break?

1410
01:03:03.742 --> 01:03:04.868
Yeah. sure. Yeah.

1411
01:03:04.868 --> 01:03:07.245
Thank you.

1412
01:03:07.245 --> 01:03:11.082
You know. I'm so focused
on fixing the inside.

1413
01:03:11.082 --> 01:03:14.002
I totally forget
about the outside.

1414
01:03:14.002 --> 01:03:15.628
We could...

1415
01:03:15.628 --> 01:03:18.506
take up some of old shrubs
from around the back

1416
01:03:18.506 --> 01:03:20.383
and-and plant
some new fruit trees.

1417
01:03:21.468 --> 01:03:22.927
"We"?

1418
01:03:22.927 --> 01:03:24.846
Sorry. no. I--
I meant you.

1419
01:03:26.389 --> 01:03:27.807
Of course.

1420
01:03:27.807 --> 01:03:30.852
Although. I was thinking...

1421
01:03:30.852 --> 01:03:33.104
your WiFi here
is really good...

1422
01:03:33.104 --> 01:03:35.065
so I could work.

1423
01:03:35.065 --> 01:03:36.858
and Nan loves it here. too.

1424
01:03:36.858 --> 01:03:38.485
So...

1425
01:03:38.485 --> 01:03:40.195
maybe we could...

1426
01:03:40.195 --> 01:03:41.654
could stay on for a while?

1427
01:03:43.281 --> 01:03:45.492
Are you going
to break my heart?

1428
01:03:46.659 --> 01:03:48.119
No.

1429
01:03:48.119 --> 01:03:49.871
I don't do that.

1430
01:03:51.998 --> 01:03:53.249
Would it...

1431
01:03:53.249 --> 01:03:55.669
be all right if I--

1432
01:04:18.024 --> 01:04:20.110
It's just right over here.
I think.

1433
01:04:20.110 --> 01:04:22.362
There it is!

1434
01:04:25.407 --> 01:04:26.700
Wait.

1435
01:04:28.326 --> 01:04:31.329
What if he doesn't remember?

1436
01:04:33.206 --> 01:04:35.166
Whatever happens.
we will be there with you.

1437
01:04:35.166 --> 01:04:37.002
no matter what. okay?

1438
01:04:37.002 --> 01:04:38.878
Come here.

1439
01:05:22.756 --> 01:05:24.007
Uncle Orion?

1440
01:05:26.092 --> 01:05:28.636
Do you remember me?

1441
01:05:38.104 --> 01:05:40.273
I forget so much...

1442
01:05:40.273 --> 01:05:41.524
these days.

1443
01:05:43.068 --> 01:05:45.737
So much.

1444
01:05:47.113 --> 01:05:48.907
But I will

1445
01:05:48.907 --> 01:05:52.118
always remember...

1446
01:05:52.118 --> 01:05:54.537
my little Leo.

1447
01:05:57.499 --> 01:06:00.960
Come here. boy.
Come here!

1448
01:06:07.967 --> 01:06:09.302
Let's get outta here.

1449
01:06:20.063 --> 01:06:22.023
How you doing?

1450
01:06:22.023 --> 01:06:23.566
Fine.

1451
01:06:23.566 --> 01:06:25.694
- For real?
- For real.

1452
01:06:25.694 --> 01:06:27.696
Liar.

1453
01:06:30.490 --> 01:06:32.158
Okay. well. here's the thing.

1454
01:06:32.158 --> 01:06:34.285
I. um...

1455
01:06:34.285 --> 01:06:36.246
I spoke to Peter

1456
01:06:36.246 --> 01:06:38.623
about trying to find

1457
01:06:38.623 --> 01:06:41.960
a more art-centric
secondary school for Leo

1458
01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:43.920
in Athens.

1459
01:06:48.383 --> 01:06:51.011
Wow. that's really
not like you. Trace.

1460
01:06:53.722 --> 01:06:55.015
I know.

1461
01:06:57.142 --> 01:06:58.852
I know.

1462
01:07:06.484 --> 01:07:08.069
<i>So. Peter has been</i>

1463
01:07:08.069 --> 01:07:09.612
checking everywhere

1464
01:07:09.612 --> 01:07:10.947
and there is a residential
school with a strong art program

1465
01:07:10.947 --> 01:07:12.407
<i>in Athens.</i>

1466
01:07:12.407 --> 01:07:13.742
<i>but it's wait-listed
for two years.</i>

1467
01:07:13.742 --> 01:07:16.494
Okay. well. that's better
than nothing. I guess.

1468
01:07:16.494 --> 01:07:18.121
I mean. we can get him
on the list now. right?

1469
01:07:18.121 --> 01:07:20.248
<i>But they have very little
in the way of athletics</i>

1470
01:07:20.248 --> 01:07:21.416
<i>and their test scores
are much lower</i>

1471
01:07:21.416 --> 01:07:22.751
<i>than where he is now.</i>

1472
01:07:22.751 --> 01:07:24.836
Oh! Why did I think
this would be easy?

1473
01:07:26.421 --> 01:07:29.716
Wait.
What aren't you telling me?

1474
01:07:29.716 --> 01:07:31.259
She has the worst poker face.

1475
01:07:31.259 --> 01:07:33.261
<i>You'd think she'd get
better at it over the years.</i>

1476
01:07:33.261 --> 01:07:34.929
<i>I'm right here.
I can hear you.</i>

1477
01:07:34.929 --> 01:07:36.598
Tell me. Avery.

1478
01:07:36.598 --> 01:07:37.974
<i>Okay. fine.
Peter wanted me</i>

1479
01:07:37.974 --> 01:07:40.393
to mention he did find
a school that fit the bill.

1480
01:07:40.393 --> 01:07:41.895
It's grade 7 through 12.

1481
01:07:41.895 --> 01:07:43.104
focuses on art.

1482
01:07:43.104 --> 01:07:44.981
has a strong sports program.
including track.

1483
01:07:44.981 --> 01:07:48.109
and has a residential program
for international students.

1484
01:07:48.109 --> 01:07:50.028
- That sounds perfect!
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1485
01:07:50.028 --> 01:07:51.237
It's very expensive. though.

1486
01:07:51.237 --> 01:07:53.573
How much?

1487
01:07:53.573 --> 01:07:55.200
Numbers that make me nervous.

1488
01:07:56.951 --> 01:07:58.745
And where is it?

1489
01:07:58.745 --> 01:07:59.788
Okay. this is the funny part.

1490
01:07:59.788 --> 01:08:00.622
Why?

1491
01:08:00.622 --> 01:08:01.915
<i>It's in New York City.</i>

1492
01:08:01.915 --> 01:08:04.459
<i>It's about 12 blocks
from your house.</i>

1493
01:08:05.585 --> 01:08:06.795
You know what? I gotta run.

1494
01:08:06.795 --> 01:08:08.463
<i>I gotta pick up Daniel
from daycare.</i>

1495
01:08:08.463 --> 01:08:09.881
<i>but I'm gonna
email you all the info.</i>

1496
01:08:09.881 --> 01:08:10.924
Thank you.

1497
01:08:10.924 --> 01:08:13.385
Seriously. Avery.
thank you so much.

1498
01:08:13.385 --> 01:08:14.552
Love you.

1499
01:08:14.552 --> 01:08:15.804
Bye. Love you both.

1500
01:08:29.943 --> 01:08:30.860
How expensive?

1501
01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:32.821
Numbers
that make Avery nervous.

1502
01:08:32.821 --> 01:08:33.780
Hmm!

1503
01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:36.324
But we could save money...

1504
01:08:36.324 --> 01:08:38.284
if we let Leo live with us.

1505
01:08:39.744 --> 01:08:41.037
Maybe?

1506
01:08:48.461 --> 01:08:49.921
Trace. uh...

1507
01:08:49.921 --> 01:08:51.715
we've been dancing around
this topic

1508
01:08:51.715 --> 01:08:52.716
the entire time
we've been here.

1509
01:08:52.716 --> 01:08:55.385
We don't even see each other.

1510
01:08:55.385 --> 01:08:56.845
We just don't have time.

1511
01:08:56.845 --> 01:08:58.638
and now you want to add
a kid into the mix?

1512
01:08:58.638 --> 01:09:00.056
You're right.

1513
01:09:00.056 --> 01:09:03.643
It's time to stop dancing and...

1514
01:09:03.643 --> 01:09:06.187
...leave Leo
out of the equation.

1515
01:09:08.648 --> 01:09:10.942
Nick. sometimes. I feel like

1516
01:09:10.942 --> 01:09:14.404
I'm married
to a bunch of cute Post-it notes

1517
01:09:14.404 --> 01:09:16.906
and delicious leftovers.

1518
01:09:18.158 --> 01:09:20.368
Yeah. I get it.

1519
01:09:20.368 --> 01:09:21.494
So we have to fix it.

1520
01:09:21.494 --> 01:09:24.706
I want to.

1521
01:09:24.706 --> 01:09:27.125
Do you have any ideas?

1522
01:09:27.125 --> 01:09:30.211
Well. there are two of us
in this marriage...

1523
01:09:31.588 --> 01:09:34.591
So. either we figure
this out together.

1524
01:09:34.591 --> 01:09:36.801
- or...
- Or...?

1525
01:09:36.801 --> 01:09:39.095
We won't figure it out at all.

1526
01:10:01.951 --> 01:10:03.078
May I?

1527
01:10:03.078 --> 01:10:05.080
Oh. please. join me.

1528
01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:06.915
Tracy.

1529
01:10:06.915 --> 01:10:10.460
I have held onto this box
for a very long time.

1530
01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:12.671
Some of its contents are mine.

1531
01:10:12.671 --> 01:10:14.464
some belonged to my parents...

1532
01:10:14.464 --> 01:10:16.341
even my grandparents.

1533
01:10:16.341 --> 01:10:18.259
What's inside?

1534
01:10:18.259 --> 01:10:20.804
Letters.

1535
01:10:20.804 --> 01:10:23.932
And I am ready
to send them to auction...

1536
01:10:23.932 --> 01:10:27.602
because I have finally found

1537
01:10:27.602 --> 01:10:29.646
someone I can trust.

1538
01:10:30.563 --> 01:10:31.815
Why me?

1539
01:10:31.815 --> 01:10:33.733
There are several reasons.

1540
01:10:33.733 --> 01:10:35.985
but mostly because
I've seen you with your friends.

1541
01:10:36.945 --> 01:10:39.155
I had a friendship
like that once.

1542
01:10:39.155 --> 01:10:41.074
So I know.

1543
01:10:41.074 --> 01:10:42.492
that to keep
that kind of friendship

1544
01:10:42.492 --> 01:10:44.703
for that long...

1545
01:10:44.703 --> 01:10:46.663
that is someone you can trust.

1546
01:10:46.663 --> 01:10:48.623
I'm honored. Lady Dalton.

1547
01:10:48.623 --> 01:10:51.626
With the proceeds
of these letters.

1548
01:10:51.626 --> 01:10:53.503
I am setting up a scholarship

1549
01:10:53.503 --> 01:10:55.338
for Leo to attend
whichever school

1550
01:10:55.338 --> 01:10:57.132
you and your husband
think best.

1551
01:10:57.132 --> 01:11:00.176
Lady Dalton.
that is so kind of you.

1552
01:11:00.176 --> 01:11:01.594
but you can't think that--

1553
01:11:01.594 --> 01:11:03.722
The advantage of being me
is I can do whatever I want.

1554
01:11:05.056 --> 01:11:07.934
Now. that boy will do
spectacular things one day.

1555
01:11:07.934 --> 01:11:09.602
as long as he has people
in his life

1556
01:11:09.602 --> 01:11:11.646
like you and Nick
to guide him.

1557
01:11:11.646 --> 01:11:12.981
With the rest of this.

1558
01:11:12.981 --> 01:11:16.192
I intend to buy
a little cottage up the road.

1559
01:11:16.192 --> 01:11:17.485
so I can live here

1560
01:11:17.485 --> 01:11:19.112
when Colin and Tessa
get married.

1561
01:11:19.112 --> 01:11:20.780
Oh. nothing large...

1562
01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:24.993
just five or six bedrooms. maybe?

1563
01:11:24.993 --> 01:11:26.828
It sounds like
you're expecting those letters

1564
01:11:26.828 --> 01:11:29.205
to bring quite a lot.

1565
01:11:29.205 --> 01:11:30.331
Who are they from?

1566
01:11:30.331 --> 01:11:33.084
Oh. just some names

1567
01:11:33.084 --> 01:11:36.338
that may well
be familiar to you.

1568
01:11:36.338 --> 01:11:37.422
Spencer...

1569
01:11:37.422 --> 01:11:38.673
Windsor...

1570
01:11:38.673 --> 01:11:40.342
Mountbatten...

1571
01:11:40.342 --> 01:11:42.635
Churchill.

1572
01:11:42.635 --> 01:11:44.304
Winston Churchill?

1573
01:11:44.304 --> 01:11:46.431
Your tea's getting cold. dear.

1574
01:12:06.076 --> 01:12:07.410
Excuse me...

1575
01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:08.411
is this sunset taken?

1576
01:12:09.412 --> 01:12:10.789
Please.

1577
01:12:20.298 --> 01:12:22.300
So. I talked
to my sister. Monica. last night

1578
01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:23.468
about a couple things.

1579
01:12:23.468 --> 01:12:25.553
One. she offered
her opinion

1580
01:12:25.553 --> 01:12:28.056
about my successes
as a husband.

1581
01:12:29.265 --> 01:12:31.559
And two...

1582
01:12:31.559 --> 01:12:33.186
I offered her

1583
01:12:33.186 --> 01:12:36.898
the position of business manager
at the restaurant.

1584
01:12:38.108 --> 01:12:39.984
Now she'll get to yell at people
and get paid for it.

1585
01:12:39.984 --> 01:12:41.444
instead of her doing it
for free.

1586
01:12:41.444 --> 01:12:42.612
Well. you know what they say--

1587
01:12:42.612 --> 01:12:43.738
you do what you love.

1588
01:12:43.738 --> 01:12:45.156
you don't work
a day in your life.

1589
01:12:45.156 --> 01:12:46.825
Yeah.

1590
01:12:50.787 --> 01:12:52.580
As far as Leo is concerned.

1591
01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:53.915
I just never thought

1592
01:12:53.915 --> 01:12:55.834
that I'd be making cannolis
for a bake sale

1593
01:12:55.834 --> 01:12:57.919
or taking a kid and his friends
to the Jets' games

1594
01:12:57.919 --> 01:12:59.546
or having somebody live with us.

1595
01:12:59.546 --> 01:13:01.548
It's just not
who I thought we were.

1596
01:13:06.011 --> 01:13:09.597
Okay.

1597
01:13:09.597 --> 01:13:11.558
Then we won't do it.

1598
01:13:12.851 --> 01:13:14.060
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

1599
01:13:16.813 --> 01:13:19.899
And I do really want
to help Leo...

1600
01:13:21.192 --> 01:13:23.486
...but we don't have to be
involved in his life.

1601
01:13:23.486 --> 01:13:25.280
if that's not what you want.

1602
01:13:29.993 --> 01:13:31.411
You know. the thing is.

1603
01:13:31.411 --> 01:13:32.954
the more I think about it.

1604
01:13:32.954 --> 01:13:34.372
the more I realize...

1605
01:13:34.372 --> 01:13:35.957
that is what I want.

1606
01:13:35.957 --> 01:13:38.793
You know.
I-I know that it's not us...

1607
01:13:38.793 --> 01:13:40.795
Maybe it is us?

1608
01:13:40.795 --> 01:13:42.422
Maybe it is!

1609
01:13:44.174 --> 01:13:45.675
I love you.

1610
01:13:45.675 --> 01:13:47.218
Good.

1611
01:13:47.218 --> 01:13:48.887
'cause you're stuck with me forever.

1612
01:13:57.062 --> 01:13:59.522
Can you believe this view?

1613
01:13:59.522 --> 01:14:01.358
It's beautiful.

1614
01:14:14.746 --> 01:14:16.664
With your permission.
we would like

1615
01:14:16.664 --> 01:14:19.793
to present these options to Leo.
and let him decide for himself.

1616
01:14:19.793 --> 01:14:22.045
Art and running?

1617
01:14:22.045 --> 01:14:24.047
Yeah.

1618
01:14:24.047 --> 01:14:26.758
And when he's done with school.
then what?

1619
01:14:26.758 --> 01:14:28.677
Well...

1620
01:14:28.677 --> 01:14:32.681
Enough of this foolishness.

1621
01:14:32.681 --> 01:14:35.266
I know you think
you're saving him.

1622
01:14:35.266 --> 01:14:37.060
You're not.

1623
01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:39.604
Go home.

1624
01:14:39.604 --> 01:14:42.148
Leave him and me alone.

1625
01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:47.904
Leo.

1626
01:14:54.411 --> 01:14:55.954
Leo! Wait!

1627
01:15:04.045 --> 01:15:05.797
Mr. Papadopoulos.

1628
01:15:05.797 --> 01:15:08.591
what do you do for fun?

1629
01:15:08.591 --> 01:15:11.344
Or to relax?

1630
01:15:11.344 --> 01:15:13.513
Well. uh...

1631
01:15:14.889 --> 01:15:16.933
I read a lot.

1632
01:15:16.933 --> 01:15:19.644
Mysteries. mostly.

1633
01:15:19.644 --> 01:15:23.231
And I go to the cinema
and museums.

1634
01:15:23.231 --> 01:15:25.442
And I sing at the church choir.

1635
01:15:25.442 --> 01:15:29.446
Those are all
very beautiful forms of art.

1636
01:15:32.157 --> 01:15:35.285
Someone wrote that book.

1637
01:15:35.285 --> 01:15:36.995
Someone...

1638
01:15:36.995 --> 01:15:39.164
filmed that movie.

1639
01:15:39.164 --> 01:15:41.291
painted that masterpiece...

1640
01:15:42.459 --> 01:15:45.211
...and composed the music
that you sing.

1641
01:15:47.547 --> 01:15:50.300
What would your life be like
without art?

1642
01:15:51.551 --> 01:15:53.303
Could you even last a week?

1643
01:15:55.347 --> 01:15:57.974
Especially
when times are tough.

1644
01:15:57.974 --> 01:16:00.769
You and I have
one thing in common--

1645
01:16:00.769 --> 01:16:03.480
we both turn to the arts
for comfort.

1646
01:16:04.731 --> 01:16:06.316
I can't predict the future...

1647
01:16:07.984 --> 01:16:10.236
...but I do know one thing.

1648
01:16:11.863 --> 01:16:16.868
Leo will either grow up
to be an artist...

1649
01:16:16.868 --> 01:16:20.455
or he will grow up frustrated
and regretful

1650
01:16:20.455 --> 01:16:23.375
that he never even
got the chance.

1651
01:16:41.267 --> 01:16:42.602
Hey.

1652
01:16:42.602 --> 01:16:43.853
Mind if I sit down?

1653
01:16:54.072 --> 01:16:57.325
If I go to school
in New York...

1654
01:16:57.325 --> 01:17:00.245
could I live
with you and Tracy?

1655
01:17:01.204 --> 01:17:03.164
Yeah. if you want.

1656
01:17:06.126 --> 01:17:10.046
And when I run in the Olympics.

1657
01:17:10.046 --> 01:17:11.631
could I still
represent Greece?

1658
01:17:11.631 --> 01:17:13.091
Of course!

1659
01:17:13.091 --> 01:17:14.884
You're Greek.
Nothing can change that.

1660
01:17:18.471 --> 01:17:20.765
Could I still
write to my uncle every week?

1661
01:17:20.765 --> 01:17:22.517
Absolutely.

1662
01:17:22.517 --> 01:17:24.519
You could even come visit him.
if you want.

1663
01:17:25.854 --> 01:17:28.440
And could you add

1664
01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:30.108
some Greek food
to your fusion restaurants?

1665
01:17:30.108 --> 01:17:32.444
Ooh... I don't know about that.

1666
01:17:32.444 --> 01:17:34.487
I mean. we could ask Xander
for some recipes--

1667
01:17:34.487 --> 01:17:35.572
No!

1668
01:17:41.494 --> 01:17:44.873
What if Headmaster Papadopoulos
won't let me go?

1669
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:50.628
Oh...

1670
01:17:52.213 --> 01:17:54.299
I don't know. Leo.

1671
01:17:55.842 --> 01:17:57.552
I just don't know.

1672
01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:00.680
Come here.

1673
01:18:13.443 --> 01:18:15.028
Did you check under the bed?

1674
01:18:15.028 --> 01:18:16.446
Yeah. twice.
Did you check the dresser?

1675
01:18:16.446 --> 01:18:17.447
Twice.

1676
01:18:17.447 --> 01:18:19.199
You know. I can't believe

1677
01:18:19.199 --> 01:18:20.992
Papadopoulos
didn't even contact us.

1678
01:18:20.992 --> 01:18:22.911
Yeah. Want me to head
down to the school

1679
01:18:22.911 --> 01:18:24.329
and lean on him a little?

1680
01:18:24.329 --> 01:18:26.539
No.
but thank you for offering.

1681
01:18:26.539 --> 01:18:27.499
Mm.

1682
01:18:27.499 --> 01:18:29.250
Where is Xander?

1683
01:18:35.048 --> 01:18:37.092
So. are you still
taking the veil to Spain?

1684
01:18:37.092 --> 01:18:38.635
Oh! No. actually.

1685
01:18:38.635 --> 01:18:40.512
We're gonna give it
to Nick's sister. Monica.

1686
01:18:40.512 --> 01:18:42.430
when she joins us
in New York next week.

1687
01:18:42.430 --> 01:18:44.724
Oh.

1688
01:18:44.724 --> 01:18:46.393
Oh. Lady Dalton.

1689
01:18:46.393 --> 01:18:47.560
it's been such
a pleasure getting to know you.

1690
01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:49.145
For me. too.

1691
01:18:49.145 --> 01:18:51.356
Mrs. Serchio?

1692
01:18:51.356 --> 01:18:55.110
I have a young man here
who would like to talk to you...

1693
01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:56.903
about art.

1694
01:19:06.705 --> 01:19:09.249
There will be
several kilometers of red tape

1695
01:19:09.249 --> 01:19:11.376
to get through.
to make this happen.

1696
01:19:11.376 --> 01:19:12.669
Do we look like
the kind of people

1697
01:19:12.669 --> 01:19:13.837
that are afraid
of a little red tape?

1698
01:19:15.755 --> 01:19:17.590
Thank you very much.

1699
01:19:34.941 --> 01:19:36.234
Hurray!

1700
01:19:44.868 --> 01:19:46.911
I can't believe
we're back in Greece so soon.

1701
01:19:46.911 --> 01:19:48.580
Not that I'm complaining.

1702
01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:50.707
Isn't Tessa
a stunning bride?

1703
01:19:50.707 --> 01:19:52.667
In a beautiful veil.

1704
01:19:52.667 --> 01:19:55.253
And the earrings
from Arianna's portrait

1705
01:19:55.253 --> 01:19:56.671
look great with your dress.

1706
01:19:56.671 --> 01:19:57.797
Thank you!

1707
01:19:57.797 --> 01:19:59.090
I think they look great
with everything.

1708
01:19:59.090 --> 01:20:00.425
You look beautiful.

1709
01:20:00.425 --> 01:20:02.218
Tracy?
Lady Dalton told me

1710
01:20:02.218 --> 01:20:03.386
that you said

1711
01:20:03.386 --> 01:20:05.388
if the veil worked
for a sixth time.

1712
01:20:05.388 --> 01:20:07.474
that you would finally
believe in it.

1713
01:20:07.474 --> 01:20:09.934
It's actually seven times.

1714
01:20:09.934 --> 01:20:11.061
Oh. that's right!

1715
01:20:11.061 --> 01:20:12.645
Nick's sister's
finally found love.

1716
01:20:12.645 --> 01:20:14.314
Is the wedding
gonna be in New York?

1717
01:20:14.314 --> 01:20:16.149
It is. Next month.

1718
01:20:16.149 --> 01:20:17.275
Do you want to crash it?

1719
01:20:17.275 --> 01:20:19.486
Uh. absolutely. we do!

1720
01:20:19.486 --> 01:20:20.820
I mean. that's what we do.

1721
01:20:24.991 --> 01:20:26.242
Hey. Mom!

1722
01:20:26.242 --> 01:20:27.452
Pen has a new boat
and she says

1723
01:20:27.452 --> 01:20:28.953
that she can take me out
in it tomorrow.

1724
01:20:28.953 --> 01:20:30.163
Is that okay?

1725
01:20:30.163 --> 01:20:31.206
Sure.

1726
01:20:31.206 --> 01:20:33.041
Ah! Yes! Thank you!

1727
01:20:34.209 --> 01:20:36.127
Tracy...

1728
01:20:36.127 --> 01:20:38.421
did Leo just call you "Mom"?

1729
01:20:38.421 --> 01:20:40.048
Yeah. he does that sometimes.

1730
01:20:40.048 --> 01:20:41.383
I'm...

1731
01:20:41.383 --> 01:20:44.469
I'm just letting him decide
who I am to him.

1732
01:20:44.469 --> 01:20:46.304
I think that's beautiful.

1733
01:20:46.304 --> 01:20:47.806
- You do?
- Yes.

1734
01:20:47.806 --> 01:20:49.182
You think it's okay?

1735
01:20:49.182 --> 01:20:52.435
I think that's very okay.

1736
01:20:52.435 --> 01:20:53.978
Milady? Sorry to interrupt.

1737
01:20:53.978 --> 01:20:55.563
- May I have this dance?
- Always.

1738
01:20:57.816 --> 01:21:00.360
Oh!

1739
01:21:01.528 --> 01:21:02.654
Oh. you know what?

1740
01:21:02.654 --> 01:21:04.322
Could we just have the bottle?

1741
01:21:04.322 --> 01:21:05.699
Thank you.

1742
01:21:05.699 --> 01:21:07.200
- I mean. just in case.
- Just in case!

1743
01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:08.785
Yeah. we'll just
sit it right there.

1744
01:21:08.785 --> 01:21:09.744
Give me your glass.

1745
01:21:20.463 --> 01:21:23.633
Thank you so much
for lending me the veil.

1746
01:21:23.633 --> 01:21:26.052
And for bringing it
here last year.

1747
01:21:26.052 --> 01:21:28.513
I'm so happy for you.

1748
01:21:29.889 --> 01:21:32.392
You're coming back down
to the party. aren't you?

1749
01:21:32.392 --> 01:21:33.518
Oh. yes. we will.

1750
01:21:33.518 --> 01:21:35.353
We just have a tradition
to see to first.

1751
01:21:35.353 --> 01:21:36.646
Okay. See you down there.

1752
01:21:36.646 --> 01:21:38.148
Okay.

1753
01:21:38.148 --> 01:21:39.774
All right...

1754
01:21:39.774 --> 01:21:41.276
I think it's time.

1755
01:21:41.276 --> 01:21:42.986
It's time.

1756
01:21:42.986 --> 01:21:45.405
Can you imagine
how different our lives would be

1757
01:21:45.405 --> 01:21:47.198
without the veil?

1758
01:21:47.198 --> 01:21:48.241
I can't even think about it.

1759
01:21:48.241 --> 01:21:50.994
Does that mean
you finally believe?

1760
01:21:50.994 --> 01:21:54.330
Avery.

1761
01:21:54.330 --> 01:21:55.957
I believe in the veil.

1762
01:21:55.957 --> 01:21:58.209
Oh!

1763
01:21:58.209 --> 01:21:59.878
To the veil!

1764
01:22:11.890 --> 01:22:14.267
Hello! <i>Kalimera.</i>

1765
01:22:14.267 --> 01:22:16.102
What a beautiful hat!

1766
01:22:17.562 --> 01:22:20.774
You seem just like
the kind of fine ladies

1767
01:22:20.774 --> 01:22:23.401
who appreciate
great jewelry.

1768
01:22:23.401 --> 01:22:24.986
Come. come.
Follow me. follow me.

1769
01:22:28.073 --> 01:22:30.909
Look... at this.

1770
01:22:30.909 --> 01:22:32.243
Oh. that is so pretty.

1771
01:22:32.243 --> 01:22:34.371
It looks very old.

1772
01:22:34.371 --> 01:22:35.497
19th century?

1773
01:22:35.497 --> 01:22:39.417
Yes! They say 1860s.

1774
01:22:39.417 --> 01:22:42.796
but this is
a very special piece.

1775
01:22:42.796 --> 01:22:44.130
Really?

1776
01:22:44.130 --> 01:22:45.757
What's so special about it?

1777
01:22:45.757 --> 01:22:49.803
Apparently. there is a legend
associated with this necklace.

1778
01:22:49.803 --> 01:22:52.722
For anyone
who is in possession of it...

1779
01:22:55.058 --> 01:22:56.643
Want to hear about it?

1780
01:22:58.436 --> 01:22:59.854
Tell me more.

1781
01:23:04.526 --> 01:23:05.777
When I first met Tracy.

1782
01:23:05.777 --> 01:23:08.279
she tried to steal
my alteration appointment.

1783
01:23:08.279 --> 01:23:09.614
Because when I first met Nick.

1784
01:23:09.614 --> 01:23:11.449
he had already
stolen my appointment.

1785
01:23:11.449 --> 01:23:12.784
What? You were 15 minutes late!

1786
01:23:12.784 --> 01:23:14.411
In my restaurant.
if you're 15 minutes late.

1787
01:23:14.411 --> 01:23:15.578
you lose
your reservation.

1788
01:23:15.578 --> 01:23:17.497
He was 15 minutes early.

1789
01:23:17.497 --> 01:23:19.457
What. do you seat people
when they arrive early?

1790
01:23:19.457 --> 01:23:21.584
Absolutely.

1791
01:23:21.584 --> 01:23:23.461
Oh. Well. it doesn't matter.

1792
01:23:23.461 --> 01:23:24.796
Well. it doesn't matter.

1793
01:23:24.796 --> 01:23:25.964
because she just stole
her appointment back.

1794
01:23:25.964 --> 01:23:27.382
What can I say?

1795
01:23:27.382 --> 01:23:29.092
All's fair
in love and veils.

1796
01:23:29.092 --> 01:23:30.635
Ooh. nice.
