- Turkey's economy...
- Europe is in the same situation...

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.496
- Multiply the figures of tuik by two and a half…
- raise. raise. raise. how far?

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.216
- The target is the 100th anniversary of the republic…
- uff!

6
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.240
By Allah. nothing
to watch is on TV.

7
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.600
You really lost our heart.

8
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.600
Look at this situation. you
go up a channel. everything

9
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.880
is fine. you go down a
channel. everything is very bad.

10
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.400
You go up a channel. we fly.
you go down a channel. we crash.

11
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.640
Which one is my brother.
you made us crazy too.

12
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.320
Aha. the bill came too.

13
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.376
Every month. the invoice comes on the same
day. at the same hour. at the same minute.

14
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.280
So it hasn't changed. It doesn't bounce.

15
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
900 pounds?

16
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.160
How about 900 liras?
No. no. I'll take another look.

17
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.520
I looked. it's still 900 lira.
I swear it can't be something like that.

18
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.560
Would it cost 900 liras to the tiny house?

19
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.000
Is she 90? No. there is another zero.

20
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.960
God. God. Ahh. God. God!

21
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.400
I'm on fire. god. I'm
on fire. my god friends.

22
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.240
Grow up friends. I swear I got
burned. I burned for a long time.

23
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.520
- I was stabbed in my back.
- What's going on. recep. what's going on?

24
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.160
I received a 900 lira
electricity bill. brother salih.

25
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.720
50 lira was coming here.
How much did it cost you?

26
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.376
- It doesn't come to me.
- How is it not coming?

27
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.480
My cut has already been recep for three
months. I couldn't pay. they hung up.

28
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.280
Oh my god. let me save my life too. By
Allah. I will leave myself to the void...

29
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.536
- What is this? What's this?
- I'll take an order. get out.

30
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.960
Walk away. To the start order.
My electricity bill came to 900 lira.

31
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.080
Shhh look at me halime.
how much is it for you?

32
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.440
200 came.

33
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.736
Are you using illegally or are
you using electricity from me?

34
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.240
- Did you hook my line?
- Get out of there. Get out of here.

35
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.800
Go get your order from
somewhere else. don't bother me.

36
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.400
I swear I'm going to
throw myself here huh.

37
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.040
Friends. friends!

38
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.296
Brother salih. let me know that I am going
to go inside nurullah and commit suicide.

39
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.680
Don't be ridiculous. Rex.

40
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.200
I'm ending my life. sorry.
I am committing suicide.

41
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.760
- My mother.
- Get well soon. brother.

42
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.560
Thanks. Thank you. Thanks to friends.
Thanks to friends. nurullah.

43
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.000
Brother. why are you talking
like that. you make me sad.

44
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.280
I have 400 lira income. how
can I pay the 900 lira bill?

45
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.920
Is this a thermal power plant?

46
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.800
Is this an industrial facility?

47
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.920
Is this a factory?

48
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.440
Two rooms and a living room here.
Look how insanity came. did you see?

49
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.040
- Brother. should it not exceed 150 kilowatts?
- How can I understand him. nurullah?

50
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.416
- I don't know.
- How will I know?

51
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.896
Do we put a meter on our ass and we will
understand that one hundred and fifty kilowatts.

52
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.560
How do we know?
I'm lighting two light bulbs.

53
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.200
I only light two light bulbs.
I am nurullah in this house.

54
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.920
Ah. they are also open. Close and close.

55
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.160
Get up. close quickly.
Next month we burned again.

56
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.000
I swear to you. god will give you trouble
for lighting a light bulb from now on.

57
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.520
God damn that Thomas

58
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.600
Edison. and that
Nicola Tesla. too.

59
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.440
Brother. calm down please. calm down.

60
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.040
Either I save. save.
save. came here.

61
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.600
I warm my shirt by
putting the lahmacun of the

62
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.840
night before while ironing
the shirt the next day.

63
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.920
I dry my socks in the
oven with the pastry.

64
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.280
This is how we live. but nurullah.
Are you dead? Are we living?

65
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.520
Brother. calm down bro. Do not scare me.

66
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.040
Well. from now on. I will only be illuminated
with a gas lamp at home. There's no other.

67
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.160
I will walk around the house with candlesticks
like the 14th century English royal family.

68
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.520
Open it. open my grandma's mahogany chest.

69
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.440
There would be a kerosene lamp in
it. three or five of them. Find them.

70
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.360
It's a shame. We are human. human.

71
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.040
Is it there? Did you find it?

72
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.480
Smooth! Mixing. digging
woman's chest. neat.

73
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.480
Oh brother. you're fine. you're fine.

74
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.120
- What happened man?
- There is a deed.

75
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.856
Don't mess with the woman's private
belongings. Find the gas lamp there.

76
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.040
Don't you know bro?

77
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.240
What will you do. son?
I call you gas lamp. leave the deed.

78
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.960
Gee.
Did the deceased have any other heirs?

79
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.096
- Did not have.
- Well. then this deed is your brother.

80
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.160
I don't want it. nurullah.

81
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.856
I don't want anything from the title deed.
I have no eyes for the property.

82
00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.280
Brother. take a look at this deed.

83
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.520
You attached it to the deed.

84
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.440
It's called yutan village.

85
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.456
All right. This is my grandmother's village house.
which we went to as a child. It's a dirty place.

86
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.640
He also has a key.
Come on. let's go to that village.

87
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.096
Don't be ridiculous. nurullah.

88
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.640
I'm already depressed.
I can't take village life at all. please.

89
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.536
Look. we're going to get some fresh air.
Our feet will touch the ground.

90
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.096
Let's throw out our electricity.
brother. in the village.

91
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.720
Look. you said electricity
again. you pissed me off.

92
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.416
You got my genies on me. huh? I was just
forgetting. you said electricity again.

93
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.600
Brother. don't hurt me.
let's go to that village.

94
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.360
- No. nurullah. I can't go.
- Let's go bro.

95
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.840
- No. I won't go.
- Please bro. let's go bro.

96
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.560
- Don't break me. please.
- Beg some more.

97
00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.320
- Please. it'll be fine.
- Beg some more.

98
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.440
- Come on. Rex.
- All right. go pack my suitcase.

99
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.400
Okay. go pack my suitcase.

100
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.216
- Salih brother!
- What happened. recep?

101
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.320
Make me a Lane.

102
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.560
Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow.
Would you look at this situation. nurullah?

103
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.880
Live your mind. it
was really perfect.

104
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.600
I swear. look. I can smell
my grandmother right now.

105
00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.840
It also mixes with a little
bit of dung. but I get it.

106
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.160
Ya recep. this house is very neglected.
We can't fix this house.

107
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.536
Nurullah. once you start. you
can finish this place in two days.

108
00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.520
- I'll do it?
- I'll do it?

109
00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.360
Of course you will. Aren't you my squire?

110
00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.440
Come on. come on.
I'll help you too. come on. okay.

111
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.680
Let's go. start! Come. Lol. Lol.

112
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Yes. It was very nice.

113
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.680
Get started son.

114
00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.840
Work! Paint properly!

115
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.040
Yes. get out there. Beautiful.
Hang it there. Remove. remove. remove.

116
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.360
Fix it there. where you hammered the nail.
and I'll see. No. no. it's been long.

117
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.800
You just pull it out.
knot it in there nicely.

118
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.816
Let me check the knot. Hey.

119
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.560
Take this out and tie it up nicely.

120
00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.520
Yes. did you knot it?
Hang it there nicely now.

121
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.376
Very nice. Let me have a look there.
I'm at it now. Let me see a minute.

122
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.560
Ok. it was like a flower
nurullah. it was perfect.

123
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.960
It's good like that.

124
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.800
Aha! What is it?

125
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.520
Hello! Damn! Burst! Hello!

126
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.360
- What does that say?
- No?

127
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.736
- Sorry. I don't understand. what are you saying?
- No. I say. what did you not understand?

128
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.720
No. it's like "hello". "burst" or
something. What's happening?

129
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.496
Do you have a military friend
in front of you? What's up?

130
00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.920
Okay ma'am. don't get into a
double polemic with me there.

131
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.880
Look. this is everyone's
owned land. you

132
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.080
can't come here and
set up camp in your head.

133
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.240
Camp below.
To the pasture. let's go to the pasture!

134
00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.560
- Come on bro. mind your business.
- One second. ezgi.

135
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.480
What are you saying bro? Ha?

136
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.120
Can't understand what you are saying.

137
00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.256
I'm coming. tell me. tell me here. What do
you say. what do you say? Please tell me.

138
00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.216
Looks like your nervous
system is a little up in the air.

139
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.160
I understand you
have mental problems.

140
00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.600
This is not a campground.

141
00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.920
This is everyone's
own. their own land.

142
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.600
I know my friend already owns
the land. This land is mine.

143
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.040
- Does this land belong to you?
- Yes it's mine.

144
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.040
Who says?

145
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:09.080
How about "who says"? I'm saying.
Inherited from my late grandfather. Gee.

146
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.040
Here is my grandmother's legacy.
Gee.

147
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.920
What are you showing off to me here?

148
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.656
What are you talking about. bullshit?
No. also what's going on with you?

149
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.296
What are you messing with people?
It's not your land. it's nothing.

150
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.600
Nobody who! My god. my lord.

151
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.040
Okay ma'am. okay.
Either we are neighbors here.

152
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.016
They said that the neighbor
needs the neighbour's ashes.

153
00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.200
You come tomorrow.

154
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.440
"I'm out of lemon. do you have any lemons?"
"I'm out of salt. do you have salt?"

155
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.000
Then you say that I stayed in
the field. worked. my back was stiff.

156
00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.720
My entire neck was burned. Massage the
shoulders with yogurt like this. you say.

157
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:38.960
- Aa!
- You call me.

158
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.640
- You call me.
- What are you saying bro? Repent. repent.

159
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:43.976
Why would I tell you such a thing?

None. Ok? Come on. Come on thanks.

Can't I backbite

Don't let people dictate such
a standard of living! Just relax!

178
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.536

Brother. this table is
reserved. so I can't sit here.

187

Is there a reserved table in the village

Brother. now you are new in the village.

189
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.416
the reserved table of the headman. He
doesn't want me to sit someone else down.

190
00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:27.040
No! As far as I know. the
headman's desk is in his office.

191
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.600
Did the headman get a
table in the village cafe?

Who is the mayor? What is the

Brother. you are right. it
is a slightly different model.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.456
When someone else sits down. he goes
crazy. then he takes his anger out on me.

196
00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.536
There is a different model
in the village now. coach.

197
00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.200
Get this in your head.

You see. don't you look?

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.496
Go to the most luxurious restaurant.
you will not find a kiwi orallet.

205
00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.200
But there is always a cafe in the village.

206
00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.960

You're talking about something
like "it didn't happen. it didn't happen".

213
00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.576
Don't bother with the coffee shop.

214
00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.360
I don't have a problem.

We would even play games along
the creek. throwing stones at each other.

225
00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.400
Don't you remember?

232
00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.200
The people show confidence.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.800
Tuh the choice you make.

Real estate is my own business.
I have a company.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.160
But believe me. I can't
find the time to do it.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.920
Of course. of course. dear.
Same problem with all of you.

242
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.440
You can't spare time

Will you beat it or leave it until

This has been the case
since childhood. nurullah.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.856
Her grandmother used to give
the cows to go graze. the cows

260
00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:25.840
always come. one or two
missing. Later we realized that

261
00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:29.200
he was selling the cows one by one. he was
spending it in the farm. Dishonourable.

262
00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.120
See you soon asshole.

Uff!

I really can't sleep. huh.

269
00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.240
I was terribly awkward about my place.
This woman already got on my nerves.

270
00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:08.056
They said don't buy a house. buy a neighbor. How nice. we said
that the side plot is empty. the woman came with her house.

271
00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.520
Blue-eyed yellow scourge.

272
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.240
Look at this. Here he is
snoring like a bulldog dog.

277
00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.496

278
00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.640
- In the barn?
- You're snoring like glass.

279
00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.560
Get up. get out! Exit!

280
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.520
Was it "god wake me up.
make me fall into dreams"?

281
00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.280
Here you go.

282

Aha! What are they doing there?

288
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.440

Thank you.

323

Now. is this mud that we
have known since childhood.

324
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.240
that buffaloes poop into.
that comes out of those rocks?

325
00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.520
A. yes. yes. We're talking
about mud coming out of the rocks.

326
00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.760
- Is that mud medicinal?
- I don't know. bro.

327
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.856
Ok. you go on.
If I have any questions. I will continue.

328
00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.120
I'm always waiting.
Yeah. what were we saying?

329
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.640
This mineral is high. this
healing mud is of course

330
00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:59.760
thanks to my uncle's
leadership and strong leadership.

331
00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.200
We will introduce it to the whole world.
So what are we going to introduce?

332
00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.160
Of course with this project.

333
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.640
Yutanbiance thermal resort hotel.

334
00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:12.760
Translate. As you can see
here. my dear village friends. this

335
00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:16.640
is a facility located on an
area of ​​150.000 square meters.

336
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:20.840
Aha! What the hell is that nurullah?
They're getting pretty busy here.

337
00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.600
Let's move on to the next picture.

338
00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.960
Here are our mud spas
and pools. Change.

339
00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:27.920
Dear brothers and sisters.
we have come to one of the

340
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.120
most striking and important
places of our project.

341
00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:35.840
Imagine you have a pistachio-shaped
pool with 24/7 chocolate flowing.

342
00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:39.760
You get out of the normal pool.
you put your mouth on the chocolate.

343
00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.680
you go into the pool again. Could
such a beautiful thing be possible?

344
00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:43.760
Let's change.

345
00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.120
Look. hop on the slide directly
from your room. you enter the pool in

346
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.440
the morning without washing your
face. There can be no such thing.

347
00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.680
Translate.

348
00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:54.136
Would you take a look at this beauty?
To the beauty of this project...

349
00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.000
My uncle really shed.
A work of mastery.

350
00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.960
- Do you believe?
- Here you go.

351
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.080
I'm looking at the project now. but I couldn't
see our village. Where exactly is our village?

352
00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:07.320
So. it's perfectly normal for you not to see
it. Because we removed your village from there.

353
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.760
How did you remove the village? How
do you think about removing the village?

354
00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.176
Everyone here has a home. a dormitory.
Isn't it so. gentlemen?

355
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.560
Right!

356
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.016
E. it goes like this. We. our peasant
brothers and sisters. bought their

357
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:21.240
houses. plots and lands at a price
higher than the current market price.

358
00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.720
It is very easy to
remove after purchase.

359
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.160
Anyways. Yes. When we came
to this area. I was just telling about

360
00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.080
it. and in the forest area. as you
can see. without harming the nature.

361
00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.200
we are deploying large and
small villa-style houses here.

362
00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.080
- Look here.
- Here you go. brother.

363
00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:44.000
Now. as far as I can see here. you
are building a house in the forest.

364
00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.600
Then you will cut
down trees here too.

365
00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.880
Yes. that's right.

366
00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.240
No. We said we don't touch nature.

367
00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:54.400
We place those houses
there by moving the trees there.

368
00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.240
How will you transport the
100-year-old pine forest?

369
00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:01.160
- Are you kidding us. idiot?
- What are you talking about bro? Who is this?

370
00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:06.160
E. he has a house here. he has a land. So
I know when I was a kid. Leave it to me.

371
00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.000
Ya recep. if you love your god.

372
00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.600
don't be against such
a beautiful project.

373
00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.160
We don't want it right
away. we don't want it.

374
00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:16.616
Of course. I will say we do not want it. asım.
I'm looking at the project. excuse me like my ass.

375
00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.440
Don't be silly. sir.
What an ass.

376
00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.840
So it's a pretty cool project.
Everyone liked it. This will be rewarded.

377
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.960
- I want to say something too.
- You were missing. teacher.

378
00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:29.376
If you love a silent god. we are talking.
You have no property. you have no property.

379
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:33.000
Cut it. cut it! The teacher will talk. of
course. Shall we listen to you or your teacher?

380
00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.640
- Speak. son.
- Thank you brother.

381
00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.720
Look. this project has no
contribution to the people of this region.

382
00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.160
Only you will profit from this business.

383
00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:44.760
The villagers are left with what
they sell for three cents. Is not it?

384
00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.000
Right.

385
00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.816
Why would the villagers
sell you this place?

386
00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.240
If they keep it. they will
be much more profitable.

387
00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.160
He. more profitable.

388
00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.600
Guys. you are talking nonsense.

389
00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.400
Already more than 50
percent of my peasant brothers

390
00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.520
already signed the
pre-sale contract.

391
00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:04.240
What the hell. who signed what?
I own the land here.

392
00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:07.440
Heirlooms from my grandmother
are both this village and these forests.

393
00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.840
We have so many memories here.
We grew those trees with our hands.

394
00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:15.520
I will not make you do this project here. I
will not cut down a single tree. you understand?

395
00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:19.120
Don't come here with your
hair as if you licked a buffalo.

396
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.880
I say no to your project.
No. no. no!

397
00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.120
Who cares about you
bro? After I find 50 percent.

398
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.000
I print expropriation
and expropriation as well.

399
00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.000
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

400
00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.880
No! It was that easy.

401
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.920
Look. I came here. first I
listened a little to understand

402
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.120
the subject. but I didn't
like your way of speaking.

403
00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.960
My neighbor. My neighbor.
His hand is fork. Now this is burned.

404
00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.360
- What do you trust. no?
- Come on. This one was missing. Who is this?

405
00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.720
Well. I see it for the first time in my life.
It's an environmentalist. feminist thing. I guess.

406
00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:53.760
What do you say? Don't talk nonsense.
I introduce myself. Attorney büşra altın.

407
00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.240
I also own the land here.

408
00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.800
Who are you. I don't understand that.

409
00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.560
We destroy. we destroy.
we expropriate. we collapse!

410
00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:03.240
What's up? Who are you threatening
with what? What do you trust?

411
00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.400
Look. sister. if you are a
lawyer. then you know how

412
00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.376
expropriation works. you
probably understand. right?

413
00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.840
I understand. I know very
well that expropriation business.

414
00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.040
Do you know how many I canceled?

415
00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.720
I know people like you very well.

416
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.680
Do you think you can do anything
with your money? Get out of there!

417
00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.856
Look. I didn't mean to be
disrespectful because you're a

418
00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.880
lady. but you came here and
did your show. Bravo. Bravo.

419
00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.520

For one thing. not a woman. a woman. This

Look. I'll deal with you here.

422
00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.480

Ms. Büşra. let me break
their mouths and noses.

Who are you?

432
00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.160
If I hit that chair on the
head of it. it will be okay.

433
00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.240
No! No no! Chair… ah. a!

- Don't be upset with the man! Fuck off!

I wrote you in a corner.
I'll deal with you. wait for me!

You are all welcome.
Thank you too for coming.

- You are welcome.
- Now. if I'm not mistaken

444
00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.480
six or seven months ago this
company came to our village.

445
00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.400
- Hmm.
- They wandered. dusted.

446
00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:33.200
after that. as you can guess.
they contacted our headman. asım.

447
00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.800
- Rep bro?
- No. teacher. nothing.

448
00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.520
- Brother?
- I didn't do anything. teacher.

449
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.680
Anyways. They had a meeting at the cafe.

450
00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:47.960
Tensions broke out. there were arguments.

451
00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.760
The majority said no at first.

452
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.640
There was even the
headman asim among them.

453
00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.600
- Aha look. didn't I tell you. son?
- You said it. brother.

454
00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.040
Muhtar asim has a definite job.

455
00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.480
Brother. whatever happened
next. for some reason.

456
00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:03.400
those who said no at
first started to say yes.

457
00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:06.320
Of course. There was a scam there.

458
00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.640
Of course dear.

459
00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:13.480
That stupid headman. that stupid
asım is the organizer of all these things.

460
00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.800
I'll tell you. Whatever he
did. we must do the same.

461
00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.776
- I don't know. could I explain?
- Yeah. he's right.

462
00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.440
We need to talk to these
sales people one by one.

463
00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:25.656
Look. Smart girl. Educated girl. The girl thawed the
roasted chickpeas right away without saying "lebleb".

464

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.960
Don't do it on behalf of

eggs. They're gurgling.

476
00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.640
- Tahsin emmi. don't sell your hand here.
- I will sell it.

477
00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.920
- Don't sell.
- I will sell it.

478
00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.680
- Don't sell.
- No. I'll sell it.

479
00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:24.000
There are lands that you put up for sale.
Let me love your eyes to sell their land.

480
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.720
What's wrong with you from my lands?

481
00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.960
What if I sell to you. what if I don't?

482
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.400
- The lands are mine. I will sell the lands.
- Why are you beating us out of nowhere?

483
00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.320
- Selamun aleykum.
- Uncle. we heard that you are selling too.

484
00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.600
- We will sell it.
- But your places were also partners.

485
00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.320
-Partnered. We're here to
say. "come. think about it again."

486
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.560
I don't want it to be sold.

487
00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.480
Okay. if you don't
want it. I won't sell

488
00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.240
it. so let's talk to
other partners. then.

489
00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:47.000
Look. now listen to me carefully.
We are five siblings.

490
00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:51.360
Orhan and osman hang out in the pavilion.
Orhan opposes his brother.

491
00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.400
They stick one
slap to each other.

492
00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:56.400
Orhan shook him from
below with a knife 37 times.

493
00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.240
- Is osman dead?
- It came out six months later.

494
00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.280
- The handle of the knife is still inside.
- Hoot!

495
00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.040
Selamunaleykum my aunt sultan.
Wasn't there an uncle?

496
00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.480
What was the matter. tell me.

497
00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.080
No. sister. it's not something you know.
We need to talk to him.

498
00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.960
Why can't you tell me? Are men and
women not equal? Tell me so I know.

499
00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:14.040
We will talk about the sale of land.
You probably don't know.

500
00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.680
What plot? Which plot? What sale?

501
00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:19.720
Who did he sell it to? When did it sell?
He can't sell without me knowing.

502
00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:23.616
Look. they're going to destroy this whole village.
all these forests. I love your eye. don't sell it.

503
00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:26.600
I will sell. I'm going to sell it. what
are you messing with. my nephew?

504
00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.000
This time orhan goes after samet.

505
00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:30.200
He is arguing with his wife.

506
00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:33.280
He ties the rope to his own
wife and takes her to the forest.

507
00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.800
Six months later. they found his bones.

508
00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:36.960
What are you saying?

509
00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:41.120
Osman emmi came out of coma. He
followed samet. When you can't find samet

510
00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.880
- she slipped into samet's fiancee.
- Whoa!

511
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.816
- Don't sell.
- I've made up my mind. I'll sell it.

512
00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.256
- Don't sell.
- Impossible. No. I will sell.

513
00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.656
- Don't sell it.
- I'll sell whatever you say.

514
00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:51.016
- Don't sell. Don't sell!
- I put my mind to it. I will sell it.

515
00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.840
- Can I tell you something?
- Like this.

516
00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.520
Look. on the other hand. I
shot a lion in the mountains.

517
00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.520
Give me this.
Why are you drinking like this?

518
00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.000
I'm depressed. I'm drinking.
I found this. I'm drinking.

519
00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.520
He! What's this? Let
me have a look at this.

520
00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.640
Recep brother. this is
hand sanitizer you know.

521
00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:11.320
Are you drinking antibacterial
here at dusk. brother ismail?

522
00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.800
Is something like this drinkable?

523
00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.000
I'm full of germs. I am in trouble.

524
00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.480
I drink this. I expel
germs with urine.

525
00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.800
Yahu. worry is not something
like a germ or bacteria

526
00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.280
so that brother ismail can
be used with antibacterial.

527
00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.720
- Feel. feel.
- I urinate.

528
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.536
Ismail brother. let me
love your eyes. drink less.

529
00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.720
Or do you not know
about the sale of this land?

530
00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.640
Your very vulgar
husband is selling this land.

531
00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:33.096
We can't sell that shoddy honor!
He can't sell without me knowing.

532
00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:36.680
It can never sell. Can't I
just chop it up with an ax now?

533
00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:38.680
You bastard! Unaware of me...

534
00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.600
Let's go teacher. Murder is being
committed here. run away. How much!

535
00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:45.160
- Samet prints them on the bed.
- OMG. Look at the events. To?

536
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.840
They take osman's sister nimet
and throw them into the acid well.

537
00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.576
Now that the situation is
like this. they throw songül

538
00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:54.880
and nergiz. her uncle's
daughters. into the sawdust.

539
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.680
- It's a lot of sawdust.
- Yes. they grind it with a sawdust.

540
00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:01.240
I swear. uncle. can I tell you
something? Very right decision.

541
00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:02.760
What kind of family are you?

542
00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.400
Buy it and go! God damn you.
Get up. let's go.

543
00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.840
Oof.

544
00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.016
- No. I'll sell it.
- Don't sell.

545
00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.816
- I put my mind to it. I will sell it.
- Don't sell.

546
00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:11.416
You're going to take
my arm off. I will sell it.

547
00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.000
If you sell. sell. If you sell. sell.

548
00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.640
- Good by.
- Is it a Rose?

549
00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.720
You can go.

550
00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.096
- What a stubborn man you are.
- I will sell it.

551
00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.216
What a stubborn man you are.

552
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.240
Rose Rose.

553
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:30.840
Maybe there was no result.

554
00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:34.120
Well. we went through the list one by one.
Men say Noah. not prophet.

555
00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:35.896
They all have a word in their mouth.

556
00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.200
I will sell and I will sell.
I will sell and I will sell.

557
00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.880
Don't do it! Uff!

558
00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.776
- What did you do?
- Well. my situation is not good either.

559
00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.096
I have been reading their eia
assessment report since morning.

560
00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.920
Pretty much approved.

561
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.656
Is it okay if we object to the eia report?

562
00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:52.400
We object. but you know that the
factor here is the benefit to the local

563
00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:57.120
people. and 50 percent of them want
this job. So we're not very strong there.

564
00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:00.736
Ms. Büşra. you still make your objection. They
say we didn't get out and hope is not lost.

565
00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:02.320
Okay. okay. so let me do it.

566
00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:06.800
- Recep! Recep!
- Aha! Nurullah. This is the voice of the ax sultan.

567
00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:09.320
- Oops!
- My mother came to cut us now. I wonder?

568
00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.600
- The sultan with the ax?
- He. Aunt sultan. He always travels with his axe.

569
00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:19.720
Recep! Recep!
You have you! You have you!

570
00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:23.040
-What happened. aunt sultan. what's wrong?
God sent you to us.

571
00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:26.760
Are you a maniac. aunt sultan?

572
00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:30.360
If you're going to say something nice.
why do you come with the ax in your hand?

573
00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.600
- Oh. never mind my job.
- What happened. please?

574
00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.880
The subject is very important.
We do not sell our goods.

575
00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:39.640
We do not sell our lands. fields.
villages. forest lands or any of them.

576
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.240
- Isn't it. girls?
- Yes! We do not sell!

577
00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.680
And ladies. your husbands
have already signed the

578
00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:48.000
contract with the company.
He has already given the land.

579
00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.680
How does he give? How does he give?

580
00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.440
Are you my mother or my father?
Who are you you bastard!

581
00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.736
- Are you talking to me?
- No. I'm not telling you.

582
00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.640
I say it will be my husband.
Isn't it girls?

583
00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.640
- Yes. right. yes.
- They can't.

584
00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:01.680
Here. plots and fields
are given as a wedding gift.

585
00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.360
- How did they give it to him?
- What gift?

586
00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:07.200
Here. while the girls get married.
her father gives her a field.

587
00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:09.800
Half of that field is built on the
girl so that her husband does

588
00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:13.640
not crush her. Half of those
fields are ours. They cannot sell.

589
00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:17.240
A minute. A minute. A minute.
Now ladies. do I understand correctly?

590
00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:21.000
Do you own half of these lands that your
husbands handed over to the company?

591
00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.296
- Yes!
- It belongs to us.

592
00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.440
Let me see. Take it. see it with your eyes.

593
00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.800
- Look. büşra.
- Give me that now.

594
00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:33.080
By Allah. the deeds were written jointly.

595
00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.440
- Do you think it will work?
- Naughty. recep!

596
00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:38.480
How could the whole
company overlook such a thing?

597
00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.360
Good luck to you girls.

598
00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.560
Good luck to your
fathers who do this as well.

599
00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.576
- Thank you.
- Thank you. lawyer lady.

600
00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:45.616
Now look. we're going to do this.

601
00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:48.280
You meet me at school
early in the morning.

602
00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.800
- Ok.
- We print petitions to the teacher.

603
00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.520
After that. you put
your signature nicely.

604
00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.280
You give the power of attorney to büşra.

605
00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:59.080
I'm taking those documents. I'm meeting
with büşra at the court. Understood?

606
00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.080
Okay.

607
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:03.360
God! Well. çökelek. now you think.

608
00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:06.040
Can you deal with
the anatolian woman?

609
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.800
Ladies. you go like this. sit down nicely.

610
00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:11.920
- I will inform the teacher and come.
- Ok.

611
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.960
…and we talked about how
rich it is in terms of vegetation.

612
00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.240
- This is…
- shh teacher.

613
00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:19.456
- Grab your computer and come outside.
- Recep brother. I'm in class. what happened bro?

614
00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:20.720
Five minutes. come on. grab it.

615
00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.480
I'll cut your tongue out.

616
00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.000
- What happened bro?
- Women object to the sale.

617
00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:34.480
The lands were always shared.

618
00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:37.136
Büşra is waiting for the petition.
I'll take it in the summer. Come on.

619
00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:40.160
Brother. the good news is that I
can't leave the kids and go anywhere.

620
00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.240
What should I do!

621
00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.960
- I call you an urgent matter. teacher.
- E. let's do this. recep brother.

622
00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:48.536
you go to the class for me. I'll
go out. I'll take care of it and come.

623
00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:51.440
No. Impossible. Not possible. No. It's not.

624
00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:54.680
- Brother. then I can't go out either.
- All right. Exit. Exit.

625
00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.840
Children. you will study with your
teacher recep for five to ten minutes.

626
00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.760
Then I'll be right back. okay?

627
00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.760
- Come on.
- Late.

628
00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:11.680
Sit down. Sit down.

629
00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:18.400
Aunts. Now everybody tells
me their names in order. okay?

630
00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.320
Get your tongue out now.
You said you were out.

631
00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.800
This is how you were doing to me. Let's do.

632
00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:26.840
We stayed alone. What happened?

633
00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:33.320
Yes guys. You wait quietly.
calmly. until your teacher arrives.

634
00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:36.240
I don't want to talk among
yourselves. is that understood guys?

635
00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:38.160
Here I am in compulsory service. Please.

636
00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.160
- Sorry?
- Our teacher is in our country

637
00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:42.856
he was talking about agricultural products.

638
00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:46.216
What shall we do? When your teacher comes.
he will tell you about agricultural products.

639
00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.800
Why? Do not you know?

640
00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:49.480
I know. son. Of course I know.

641
00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.880
We've been past where you live.
At that time. we also sat.

642
00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:54.640
- I guess I know.
- Then tell me.

643
00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:59.360
Tell me!
To explain! To explain!

644
00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:03.600
Stop. Children please.
Ok. guys please. Ok. cut it!

645
00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.880
A! I don't like that at all.

646
00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:10.200
Ok. I'll tell you.
Since you asked for it.

647
00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:13.336
I will handle the lesson differently. I will
work with the question and answer technique.

648
00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:15.920
Yes. I'm asking then.

649
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.560

important agricultural product?

650
00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:23.560
What? Is there any answer?
Let me see. Hey. tell me.

651
00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:25.800

655
00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:40.600

656
00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.961
You're probably saying
because of your hair. Not apricot.

657
00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:44.480
Is there?

658
00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.920
Receipt! Now listen carefully to me.

659
00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:53.080
The most important
agricultural product of our country

660
00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.600
dried beans.

661
00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:00.240
Either. You look so dumb.
You were surprised.

662
00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:03.280
For the first time. the truth is
being told to you here. friends.

663
00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.160
Well. let's repeat it now.

664
00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:08.560
Baked beans!

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:12.320
Well done. bravo to all of you.

666
00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.760

667
00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:17.480
- Recep brother. the petitions are okay.

668
00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.520
Guys. take care of yourself.

669
00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:02.400
Is the attorney here?
Barrister? The trial will begin.

670
00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.720
- Are you looking for a brother?
- Here you go.

671
00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.400
Either I have to give the
following to my lawyer lady.

672
00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.360
- Where is he himself?
- Lawyer lady is inside.

673
00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:13.360
- I'll give them a try then.
- The trial is about to begin.

674
00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:16.440
- Give it fast and get out now.
- Okay thank you. God bless you. Thanks.

675
00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:21.720
There is no Mrs. Büşra here.

676
00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:25.880
Yes. good day. Here. sit down.

677
00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:30.280
- Mr. Deputy. please take your place.

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.440
Here you go. Sit down.

679
00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:33.720
- Is that so?
- Yes. here you go.

680
00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.360
I was going to give the
document to the friend. but…

681
00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:40.120
- well. if you say sit down. let's sit down.
- Yes. the plaintiff's attorney. come on.

682
00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:43.760
Dear president. as in my
client's written statement...

683
00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:45.160
Selamun aleykum.

684
00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.360
Aleykumselam. who are you?

685
00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:49.320
I am recep ivedik. my brother. Who are you?

686
00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:51.520
- Feridun is my name.
- I'm glad. brother.

687
00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:55.920
Well bro. where is my lawyer?

688
00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:59.280
How should I know brother. your lawyer?
I don't know you.

689
00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:00.720
Aren't you a lawyer?

690
00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.240
- No. I'm not a lawyer.
- Then why did you come and sit here?

691
00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:06.720
…we demand alimony
of 100.000 tl. sir.

692
00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:10.000
E but yuh so now. Ms. Judge.
is 100.000 tl worth alimony?

693
00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:13.080
Sir. sit down.
Did I promise you?

694
00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.816
- Miss judge. look. this man is me…
- okay. enough! I didn't promise.

695
00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:18.880
Look. I'll throw it out. Mr. Deputy.
take care of it. Check it out though.

696
00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.720
I'm very sorry. sir.
Listen. woman.

697
00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.440
- Yes. go ahead. lawyer lady.
- Thank you. your honor.

698
00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:26.800
The psychological violence that my
client has suffered during his marriage…

699
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.120
god. I'm done.
I swear I'm done.

700
00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:33.416
I was left without a lawyer at the most important
hearing. Now they'll take me until my frostbite.

701
00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.760
- Oh my god…
- don't stop crying.

702
00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:37.960
Don't give up right now.
There is recep ivedik next to you.

703
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:38.960
Relax.

704
00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:41.256
I will get you out of here.
You leave it. leave it to me.

705
00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.960
Didn't you just say
you're not a lawyer?

706
00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.240
I am not. I have
nothing to do with being a

707
00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:47.240
lawyer. but I will do a
better job than a lawyer.

708
00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.760
You can't be my lawyer or anything.

709
00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:51.080
Do you have any alternatives
other than me right now?

710
00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:55.800
Do you have any alternative from me now?
I'm your only way out. Do not. Calm down.

711
00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:59.760
Plaintiff's attorney was heard.
Defendant was asked to defend his counsel.

712
00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:01.760
- Here you go. deputy.
- Watch me now.

713
00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:08.840
I will say. your honor. and distinguished
members of the jury. but the juror must be

714
00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:11.200
you do not use it in the ayvalık region.
No because.

715
00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:13.880
Therefore. I would like to
start my words as follows.

716
00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:15.840
Your honor!

717
00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:20.440
Can you see an adjective of that?
Can you take a look at this adjective?

718
00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:22.840
Excuse me. donkey
farts on your face. sir.

719
00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:25.720
Can you take a look at
that adjective. that adjective?

720
00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:28.520
It has officially turned into a medlar.

721
00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.800
It's a shackled donkey.

722
00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:35.080
This man worked day and night nonstop.

723
00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:39.720
Day and night. I say.
miss judge. day and night.

724
00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:43.240
Why? To make this woman happy.

725
00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:46.240
- This man… do you have children?
- I have got a son.

726
00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:49.840
He has one son from this woman.
a man who has a stable child.

727
00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:53.920
Let's see if he pulls his hand away
one day. let's ask that boy. Let's ask!

728
00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:58.920
Why didn't he pull? Because this
man is the father. It's father. father!

729
00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:02.080
Babos. Babo this man. babo!

730
00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:05.040
This is a man who. without
thinking of himself for

731
00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:08.680
an ounce. is only a father
to that stubborn child.

732
00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:12.320
This is such a man.
Isn't that worth it too?

733
00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:16.200
Your honor. I object
and please for the record.

734
00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:20.280
Feridun bey spent even the gold
that was worn in the childhood of his

735
00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:24.200
child in gambling and coin markets
and did not replace it in any way.

736
00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:25.840
Damn boy. did you eat the baby's gold?

737
00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:30.760
Either I bought some coins. I made such
a mixed basket. they all went bankrupt.

738
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.240
Hey. let me put it in your character. Let me
put it in the character of a man like you.

739
00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:36.920
Recep. what do you mean…

740
00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:43.160
Your honor. sir. feridun is human too.

741
00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:48.520
Like all people. feridun
can make mistakes.

742
00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:51.360
Mistake is for humans. sir.

743
00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:55.280
Yes. as feridun is a complete commodity

744
00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:00.120
it's true. he bought all his wealth
and invested the baby's gold in coins.

745
00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:03.080
False! I say it to your face too. Goods!

746
00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.840
False. I say it to your face. Goods!

747
00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:08.800
I'm saying look. property.

748
00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:10.760
Wrong sir.

749
00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:14.360
But. is this the end of our wrong life?

750
00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:18.120
Can't we hold on to
any other human value?

751
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.640
An idiot. a property.

752
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.400
are we going to spend it here
just because he made a mistake?

753
00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:28.360
Does he have no humanity?
Don't you have any conscience?

754
00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.120
It also has a heart.

755
00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:33.160
There's a tiny little
pigeon heart over there.

756
00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:36.560
Cuckoo. Cuckoo. Cuckoo.

757
00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:39.200
That's how he throws it.
Shall we break this heart?

758
00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:44.680
There is one very important quality that
this man has never had. Do you know what?

759
00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:47.040
Loyalty!

760
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.360
Loyalty is what it's called.

761
00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:55.280
They call it monogamy feridun in
the neighborhood. monogamy feridun.

762
00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:56.800
Because he is monogamous.

763
00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:02.240
He is loyal. he is a perfect. flawless
personality that puts loyalty at the forefront.

764
00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:05.920
Isn't that worth it too?
Does that even matter?

765
00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:07.736
Your honor. the main reason for

766
00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:12.240
this lawsuit is
feridun bey's infidelity.

767
00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:16.400
Video recordings and photos are
available in the attached file. sir.

768
00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.720
What am I hearing?
What am I hearing?

769
00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:21.520
Did you cheat on your wife?
Did you cheat son?

770
00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:23.520
- It was a little getaway.
- Tell the truth.

771
00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.520
- It wasn't a big deal.
- Tell the truth!

772
00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.936
They're exaggerating. recep.
There is no such thing actually.

773
00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:29.600
God damn you!

774
00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:32.360
Yes. it's over I suppose?
I will now decide.

775
00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:36.520
Sir. I would like to inform you of a
decision we made jointly with feridun.

776
00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:38.760
With all due respect
to your decision.

777
00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:42.080
Sir. feridun whispered
deeply in my ear.

778
00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:46.640
She said that I have worn out this woman
a lot. I bent this woman's head forward.

779
00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:50.280
Elimde. malımda. mülkümde
babadan kalan ne varsa dedi. Ben

780
00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:53.240
hepsini. bütün mal varlığımı
bu kadına geçiriyorum dedi.

781
00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.400
On the record. sir.

782
00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:56.840
- What. how? What are you saying. recep?
- Shut the hell up!

783
00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:00.000
He said sir. I said no alimony.

784
00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.480
the lady said to give me alimony.

785
00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:04.776
Madam judge. is there such a thing?
- Sit down. sit down!

786
00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.040
Sir. I also have a
special request from you.

787
00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:11.440
If there is cumuk cimik in the law.
it is a two-year solitary confinement.

788
00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:14.736
- Alone. Let him sleep and come to his senses.
- What about solitary confinement? What are you saying. recep?

789
00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:16.560
- Think about the shit he ate.
- Is it okay?

790
00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:18.440
- There is no such thing.
- Please be quiet.

791
00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:21.760
- But look. please. There can be no such thing.
- Silence! Be quiet please.

792
00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:25.040
Sit down! That is justice.
The woman is one hundred percent right.

793
00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:28.520
Aa. Recep. What are you doing here?
Come here. get out.

I wish you a good day.

Late. Sorry again. take it easy.

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:46.000
What are you doing?
So. what is this outfit?

801
00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.856
Well. while I was waiting for you.
I found it there because everyone

802
00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:51.080
was walking around like this. I
put it on me. It fit very well though.

803
00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:52.600
Aa. Good luck to me.

804
00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:55.720
Our eyes are clear. I won
my first case. I cleared the guy.

805
00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.240
I always played women. always women.

806
00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:59.520
- What?
- The information you want is here.

807
00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:01.000

808
00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:04.040
Either the judge is waiting for us.
Can you walk quickly? My god. my lord!

809
00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:12.240
Dear yutan village residents.
All of you are welcome. you brought joy.

810
00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:19.680
As çökelek holding. our philosophy
is always to collapse… to solve…

811
00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:24.560
we built it on solving.
Your problems are our problems.

812
00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:28.640
Of course. as we set out on
this road. we had a real leader.

813
00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:33.600
I would like to give credit to
my own uncle. enver çökelek.

814
00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:37.320
who is a true opinion leader.
He has a video message for you.

815
00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:40.800
With your applause. my uncle

817
00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:52.840
I'm enver çökelek.
I am the owner of çökelek holding.

818
00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:56.320

Çökelek holding. 50 years of experience.

821
00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:09.760
Yutanbiance is the biggest
project of çökelek holding.

822
00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:13.200
This project will either
be done or will be done.

823
00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:16.280
When I came to yutan
village years ago. I

824
00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:18.920
realized that this place
has a different beauty.

825
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.760
It doesn't matter. I said. "this
place should be mine. it's mine."

826
00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:26.400
Then I met the healing swallow mud.

827
00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:28.720
I had some friends with me.

828
00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:32.400
They said. "brother. take this mud and rub
it on your face. You are getting younger."

829
00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:33.840
I said god.

830
00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:37.480
So I took a handful. put
this mud on my forehead.

831
00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:40.840
I swear. it's been 10
minutes. I'm almost younger.

832
00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:43.600
I said it's a miracle. Miracle!

833
00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:48.680
That's the day. I said I have to take
this mud. put it on everyone's forehead.

834
00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:53.080
I hope we will put it on your forehead. We will
put it on the forehead of the whole nation.

835
00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.960
Greetings everyone. Goodbye.

836
00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:00.320
Bravo uncle. Bravo uncle.

837
00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.720

to the signing ceremony.

838
00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:06.576

- Yeah. everyone is lining up.

839
00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:08.520

No. no. No flooding.
I'm here to sign too.

849
00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:33.120
By god. we have been very
prejudiced towards çökelek holding.

850
00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.840
In other words. as I studied
the project and got into

851
00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:38.040
it. I fell in love once again.
Where are we signing?

852
00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:41.160
Good luck to you. recep.
Well. that would suit you too. Well done.

You found the right way. I will take

854
00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.320

Nasty bastard!
It's your fault in the castle area anyway.

862
00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:10.360
Mr. Erdem. you have spent so much money. but
unfortunately. this project is a dream for a while.

863
00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:11.440
What do you mean dream?

864
00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:13.960
This sale cannot be made
without the consent of these women.

865
00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:15.496
- We don't have consent!
- You can't sell!

866
00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:18.840
How? Can something like that happen?
What are they saying. asim?

867
00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:22.640
Erdem bey. whatever the men say here.
Women have no say.

868
00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:23.776
- How not!
- What does it mean?

869
00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:26.360
Don't do it! The court never says so.

870
00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:28.736
The judge made the annulment. it passed.

871
00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:30.720
These women also
have a say. understood?

872
00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:33.440
Semih. what the hell
is this guy? What's this?

873
00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:35.040
Sir. the headman directed us that way.

874
00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:37.576
What do you say. my brother. that
the headman is the headman? Gee.

Mr. Erdem. what have we
seen in the real estate sector?

890
00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:29.760
Those who go to the deed and
return without signing. such things.

891
00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:33.936
What does this have to do with the real estate sector. what
does it have to do with his return from the title deed?

Ah. the phone is ringing.
Look how painful it sounds.

893

Sir uncle?

894
00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:42.160
Put the phone on speaker.

I'm taking it uncle one second.

896
00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:49.320
E. sir. you are on
loudspeaker now. uncle.

897

Dude are you stupid?

898

- Estagfurullah. my uncle. That thing…

Then you are retarded.

900
00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:01.000
E. huh… which man is my uncle?

901
00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:05.760
The guy making the move at the signing ceremony.
The photographer threw it all away. here it is.

902
00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:07.520
I am that photographer…

903
00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:11.080
- I do not understand.
- Ha. you're saying...

904
00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:13.320
E. yes uncle. unfortunately
there was someone there who

905
00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:16.720
created a small unpleasant
incident and tried to go wild.

906
00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:19.720
But don't worry. we are
very used to such situations.

907
00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:22.400
We deal with these kind of guys
a lot when we go out on the field.

908
00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:25.960
After all. he is an ignorant peasant. sir.
There is nothing to exaggerate.

909
00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.200
Of course dear. In the
real estate industry…

910
00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:31.520
the startup is from the real
estate industry. Are you telling me?

00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:35.400
Look at me. get that man

No. no. I think he

916
00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:52.320
If it wasn't. it would make such zang
zung. zing zung sounds. In that respect.

917
00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:55.160
Am I going to explain to you?
He came to me and says zang zung.

918
00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:57.576
Go find this man as soon as possible.
take him to my uncle immediately.

919
00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:58.720

- No. you're not allowed.

We solve puzzles among

Yahu recep. what did you
do in the signature today?

00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:45.560
A phone call just came from above. From the
very beginning of the holding. from the top.

950
00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:26.920
Your weather won't hurt us.

951
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.920
I didn't buy it with public money.

952
00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:32.080
Enver bey donated the
car to the headman's office.

953
00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:36.240
Don't you understand bullshit? Well.
asım. I'll clear your head again. huh.

954
00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:37.760
I will come with my own car.

955
00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:39.776
Wait for me at the exit of
the village. I will follow you.

956
00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:42.520
Well okay. I'm waiting huh.
We go back to back.

957
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.000
Mr. Enver.

958
00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:53.200
Then after.

959
00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:56.240
You know. there was recep
ivedik you wanted to host?

960
00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:57.360
- Ha.

961
00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:58.760
Ok. wait there.

962
00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:01.480
- He is with you right now.
- What?

963
00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:04.096
Hey. I'm here. I am here. in front of you.

964
00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:06.560
Bloody alive. look.
It's not virtual either. It's real. look.

965
00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:08.640
Is your name recep?

966
00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:09.760
He is recep ivedik.

967
00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:11.880
Sit down late.

968
00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:15.680
Don't gesture to me like that. son.
You will talk to me like a man.

969
00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:19.400
You will not speak to me in the imperative.
Take a seat. Mr. Recep. you will say.

970
00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:22.560
Here you go. Mr. Recep.

971
00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:24.880
Yeah like that. Be smart. be a man.

972
00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:29.240
- Come on. leave us alone.
- Len!

973
00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:33.416
Yes. you called. we came.
what are we going to talk about?

974
00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:36.640
Huh. like this.
Let's have dessert. talk sweet. shall we?

975
00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.200
What are these?

976
00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:42.560
These are 22 carat gold
plated dragon fruit desserts.

977
00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:46.336
Where did you get these? Did you buy it from
the covered market? I did not understand.

978
00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:51.400
No. I have a special cook. this is how he
makes desserts. decorates them with gold.

979
00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:54.120
Dude. are you sick?
Are you a maniac?

980
00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:57.400
Are you mentally ill. son?
Are you uncomfortable?

981
00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:02.000
People do ten somersaults on
the way to the wedding to wear a

982
00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:04.576
quarter of gold. do you put gold
on the dessert and eat it here?

983
00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:07.600
What kind of life is this?
What kind of lifestyle is this?

984
00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:10.280
Let's say now I ate this. gold.

985
00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:14.000
Suppose we bought it for 10 liras.
I ate. gold fell to seven liras.

986
00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:16.920
What will I do? You can't take a shit.

987
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.336
At least you think that I can keep it
inside me so that we don't do any harm.

988
00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:20.960
- Just eat.
- No no.

989
00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:23.600
I can't eat 22 karat.
This is probably 22 Gauge.

990
00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:25.680
I can't eat other than
24. it makes me gas.

991
00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:26.960
You know.

992
00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:30.880
Mr. Recep. take a look around.

993
00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:32.920
What do you see?

994
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.480
I'm looking at something like this...

995
00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:40.080
I see one artificial pond. It's full of
shit. That makes a fly. It's a filthy place.

996
00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:42.880
One stone house in
the back. too big for you.

997
00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:45.840
And I see a lonely old man
waiting for death. that's all.

998
00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:47.800
Hah. that old old man.

999
00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:52.360
the owner of all the
beauties you see and count.

1000
00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:55.800
Now he will bring the same
beauties to your village.

1001
00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:59.080
I will make a corner of
heaven just like this place.

1002
00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:02.640
Thanks brother. We do not
need the heaven you will create.

1003
00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:05.560
Our village is already an
idyllic place. do you understand?

1004
00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:08.720
Just don't touch your hand.
we don't want anything else.

1005
00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:11.680
What a nonsense person you are.

1006
00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:16.240
I've been speaking beautifully
all along. but you're forcing me.

1007
00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:20.240
What if I force you brother? Ha? Let
me see. what will happen when I force you?

1008
00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:23.320
Look. my lion. don't cross the line!

1009
00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:26.360
You are smart man.
Your intuition is strong.

1010
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.000
Take your receivables. take care
of your way. let go of this business.

1011
00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:33.640
Here you go.

1012
00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:35.640
What is this?

1013
00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:39.656
What did you write here?
Did you write your tc ID. what is this?

1014
00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:42.440
The number I intend to
give you. I wrote it down.

1015
00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:45.080
- Ha. you wrote me a lot of checks.
- I wrote a check.

1016
00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:48.160
Is there a check left? 1970 model pieces.

1017
00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:50.880
Switch to blockchain until you
put virtual glasses on your eyes.

1018
00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:52.360
You should at least offer bitcoin.

1019
00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:55.160
Take your check and steal it on your head.

1020
00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:57.960
We don't need your
check or your money. son.

1021
00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:01.080
Look. I'm telling you once and for all.

1022
00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:04.600
Whether you want it or not.
even if the whole village stands

1023
00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:10.080
up. that project will be built
there. Did you understand?

1024
00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:15.360
Oh. if you try to prevent it. you
will suffer the consequences now.

1025
00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:18.880
- What are the results brother? Let's know.
- I'll burn. I'll burn!

1026
00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:21.240
That's how you know it. Ok?

1027
00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:23.760
You must have thought we
were yesterday's children.

1028
00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:28.000
We are the baby of güngören. son. These dry
threats of yours will not work against us.

1029
00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:31.400
The disaster you will create
will be a festival for us. brother.

1030
00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:33.040
Do your best.

1031
00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:36.800
Get your hands off our
skirts and make up your mind.

1032
00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:40.360
Don't mind me.
Come on. stay safe.

1033
00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:53.920
Geh. geh. geh. geh. geh. geh.
Geh. geh. geh. geh. geh. geh. geh.

1034
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.640
What's going on here bro?

1035
00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:57.680
What is it. what?
What are you doing? What?

1036
00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:00.240
Mr. Erdem. Someone with
sheep came. Mr. Erdem.

1037
00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:03.240
Hey! What's going on here?

1038
00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:07.440
Virtue! Virtue!

1039
00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:10.320
What are you doing here bro?

1040
00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:14.320
Come. I'll show you around with
your friends. "crack head!"

1041
00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:17.920
- Are you sick bro?
- What are you doing. asshole. huh?

1042
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.040
Construction has also stopped.
you're sitting idly by. aren't you? Ha?

1043
00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:23.800
You know. you were the
huge çökelek holding? Ha?

1044
00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:26.320
It was getting 50 percent.
You'll find my shit 50 percent.

1045
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:28.840
Look beautiful bro.
We're builders. okay?

1046
00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:31.800
We know how to wait. don't worry.
We are used to these situations.

1047
00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:34.880
Look at me. if you have a
bell. come and lead these.

1048
00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:36.560
You are a leader spirit.

1049
00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:39.320
Just go. for god's sake.
Don't find the trouble on us. Come on. go.

1050
00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:44.320
Take the cottage cheese! Take the cottage cheese!
Collapse precipitate. Knife pocket knife precipitate.

1051
00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:45.280
What the hell is this?

1052
00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:47.616
Cakir cracked cottage cheese.
Cakir cracked cottage cheese.

1053
00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:50.360
Laughing Rose Lily cottage cheese.
Laughing Rose Lily cottage cheese.

1054
00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:52.880
- Come on. walk!
- I don't understand what kind of man you are.

1055
00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:55.400
Geh. geh. geh. geh. geh. geh. geh. virtue!

1056
00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:58.480
Geh. geh. geh. geh. geh. virtue!
Geh. geh. geh. geh. geh. geh. geh.

1057
00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:01.800
Huh. The moon is beautiful.
Look at the consistency of this.

1058
00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:03.200
- This is perfect.
- Oh. give it.

1059
00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:05.720
- Look at this.
- Healing the moon.

1060
00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:10.080
I mean. look at what educated. cultured.
university graduates. law graduate women are doing.

1061
00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:11.800
It means that ignorance remains.

1062
00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:15.560
What does it matter?
What a beautiful healing mud.

1063
00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:17.176
Shouldn't we take advantage of that too?

1064
00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:19.480
What a beautiful skin. it
brightens and tightens recep.

1065
00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:22.800
Who told you this? Who told you
that this place makes it beautiful?

1066
00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:25.936
If not. will çökelek holding be torn because
I will come and establish a facility?

1067
00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:27.536
What if we take it out and
send it to the laboratory

1068
00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:30.440
for an analysis. the
laboratory will shut it down.

1069
00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:31.920
You're exaggerating a little now.

1070
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.000
This mud exists so that animals
can come and cool themselves.

1071
00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:39.360
The animal comes. pours itself
out of the mud. cools its body.

1072
00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:41.840
His intestines are working.
he is lying on his side.

1073
00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:45.440
He says.

1074
00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:48.800
He's letting go.

1075
00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:50.520
Good. Filthy.

1076
00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:52.216
You take it too. you rub it on your face.

1077
00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:55.600
That's enough.
Uff. you made us nauseous.

1078
00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:59.280
Even if this mud is healing. would
the women of our village be like this?

1079
00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:01.960
I remember in the past.
there was an aunt necla. she

1080
00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:05.680
put it on her face. she had
a beard. Bearded woman.

1081
00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:08.920
- Tell the truth.
- He left and left. He left the village.

1082
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:12.400
Well. why didn't you tell us that from the
beginning? We drove it all over us. recep.

1083
00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:15.216
Nothing happens at once.
He practiced for two years.

1084
00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:17.120
Currently in manisa.
He lives in mental illness.

1085
00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:20.080
A minute!

1086
00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:21.600
- What happened?
- Shhh.

1087
00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:23.840
- What is it?
- Wait a minute.

1088
00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:27.360
- Do you hear. nurullah?
- There is a sound. brother.

1089
00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:31.440
Truck movement sound
with chainsaw sound.

1090
00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:32.600
No more moon. A!

1091
00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:35.120
Or did they set the
construction in motion. büşra?

1092
00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:37.120
God bless you!

1093
00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:39.736
Get up now. tell the villagers quickly.
Let's meet at the door. quick.

1094
00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:41.776
- Get up. we're going too. Get up. let's go.
- Recep. A minute.

1095
00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:43.400
How can I come like this?

1096
00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:45.000
- Quick. quick. quick.
- Moon!

1097
00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:52.600
The villagers are
here. where is the curd?

1098
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.240
- The villagers are here. where is the cottage cheese?
- Turn it off. turn it off.

1099
00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:59.880
Bursstt! Slow down. Slow!

1100
00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:01.720
No. what a crowd.
what's going on here?

1101
00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:03.080
What's really going on with you?

1102
00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:05.360
We stopped your construction
here with a court decision.

1103
00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:07.800
You work very hard.
we hear it with our ears.

1104
00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:13.000
My dear brother. we have
already overturned that

1105
00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:15.640
court decision you have
taken in a higher court.

1106
00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:17.040
Son. give me the file.

1107
00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:18.880
- Here you go. sir.
- Let me see.

1108
00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:23.520
- I don't understand. look at this. büşra.
- Is this a supreme court decision?

1109
00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:25.360
- Yes.
- Hmm. Did you handle it as a lawyer?

1110
00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:26.840
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1111
00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:29.480
I said if my uncle steps
in. he'll get it done. right?

1112
00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:31.480
What does büşra say.
did they stop the decision?

1113
00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:33.080
Wait a minute. I'm looking.

1114
00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:35.440
Normally they don't make such a decision.

1115
00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:38.880
What did you do to make such
a decision? What did you give?

1116
00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:41.720
Did you give money?
Did you give money? Did you buy a man?

1117
00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:44.880
No no. No money giving.
Where did it come from?

1118
00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:47.120
We just negotiated with the new owners.

1119
00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:49.456
Well. what a coincidence.
when the 50 percent majority was

1120
00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:53.160
found again. the court changed
the decision in our favor. right?

1121
00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:55.160
Thanks to the realtor.

1122
00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:57.040
Aha! What did you say?

1123
00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:58.280
No. no. I didn't say.

1124
00:56:58.320 --> 00:56:59.816
- You said real estate agent. son.
- I didn't say no.

1125
00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:02.016
- You said real estate agent. I heard it with my own ears.
- No. no. I didn't say. I didn't say realtor.

1126
00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:04.160
- Real estate… did you hear that too?
- Yes!

1127
00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:05.736
- You said real estate agent.
- There is no real estate agent.

1128
00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:08.640
Which realtor did you deal with?
Which realtor did you work with?

1129
00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:10.640
No bro. no real estate agent. come on.

You'll be careful who you
mess with from now on. okay?

1131
00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:15.800
Oh. by the way. ma'am.

1132
00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:18.480
Do you know what you did
to your face it was amazing?

1133
00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:21.960

00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:31.520
This is not over here. know it like this.

1137
00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:32.640
Run it. Run it.

1138
00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:35.960
Büşra. I can only think of a
real estate agent around here.

1139
00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:37.760
- Isn't that right. friends?
- Yes!

1140
00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:40.960
Let's go and have a talk with him.
The matter will be clear then.

1141
00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:42.520
Go nurullah.

Aleykumselam. brother recep. Welcome.

1146
00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:23.080
They said there is someone
dealing with real estate around here.

1147
00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:25.880
We were also going to
look at some properties.

1148
00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:29.080
E. I already told you
you're a realtor. remember?

1149
00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:31.120
How did you look?

1150
00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:33.120
I was looking for something like this.

1151
00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:37.440
Ah! Ah! What's going on?

1152
00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:40.200
How did they find 50 percent?
How did they find it?

1153
00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:42.800
Wait. let me love your eyes.
stop. calm down. Ok. I'll explain.

1154
00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:46.640
These guys. look. they're very strong men.
I was consulting them.

1155
00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:48.400
When the villager stopped selling...

1156
00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:50.880
-To?
I sold the ones with power of attorney.

1157
00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:52.720
Of course it wasn't enough.

1158
00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:55.360
The village had common
areas. it stood empty.

1159
00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:58.240
Whether it's the headman's
office. the council of elders.

1160
00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:02.080
the village square. etc. I
have allocated this for 49 years.

1161
00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:05.280
- Of course. dear. don't let it sit idly. right?
- Is not it?

1162
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.000
Ah!

1163
00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:10.800
Ah! Wait. let me kiss your feet. recep.
I love your eyes.

1164
00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:13.280
Look. I made it for my nephews.
They said they would fire me.

1165
00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:15.320
If you love your god. don't shoot anymore.

1166
00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:19.600
Damn. is it a forbidden bite for
your nephews? Huh. is it the place?

1167
00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:21.960
Since you sold the
village. my son. I will not

1168
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:24.600
let you stay in this
village anymore. headman.

1169
00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:27.120
- Make up your mind!
- Ah!

1170
00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:30.680
Expect trouble from me. mayor.
Expect trouble from me!

1171
00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:33.560
Go away!

1172
00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:38.520
Recep bro! Recep bro! Recep bro!

1173
00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:42.760
Brother. such a notification came to the
school. What is this? I didn't fully understand.

1174
00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:44.560
Let me see. maybe I'll understand.

1175
00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:47.880
Aha. He says evacuate the school.

1176
00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:51.280
They gave 30 days.
You vacate the school within 30 days.

1177
00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:53.840
Evacuation? Well. where do we go?

1178
00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:56.976
There are so many students in the school.
Also. what does school have to do with it?

1179
00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.816
What if this clumsy headman had transferred
everything. the common area of ​​the

1180
00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:03.640
village. the school. the construction
company. to the construction company.

1181
01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:06.280
I've already beaten
him on this subject.

1182
01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:09.240
But now that the commitment
has come. I'm going to stick it once.

1183
01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:11.776
Recep bro! Recep brother.
there is no brother. It's not like that.

1184
01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:14.240
I say. let's go to the council
of elders of our village.

1185
01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:16.640
let's explain the situation
well. Let's ask their opinion.

1186
01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:17.880
Come on. let's talk.

1187
01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.080
What happened to them son?
Aren't they dead?

1188
01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:33.200
No. brother. they are
upset because they are old.

1189
01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:35.280
Uncle ihsan is the
president. if you want a nudge.

1190
01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:41.760
Uncle ihsan? Uncle ihsan? Uncle ihsan!

1191
01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:43.080
Hey to your father's donkey...

1192
01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:47.720
Uncle ihsan. they are selling the
village here. you are sleeping soundly.

1193
01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:50.120
- What kind of a council of elders is this?
- Who? What?

1194
01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:52.560
- Uncle ihsan. there is a headman.
- Yes.

1195
01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:57.640
The headman has given this council of elders
building to the contractors for 49 years.

1196
01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:00.520
They will challenge you from here.
They're going to kick your ass.

1197
01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:02.920
What? Did they sell the
council of elders building?

1198
01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:07.280
The elders are our red line.
Nobody can wash. nobody can sell.

1199
01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:09.480
How do your ears hear
when it comes to your work?

1200
01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:12.920
I said the council of elders. the tip
touched you. you started to hear right away.

1201
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.240
We need to send this headman
from the village urgently.

1202
01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:19.256
We don't want this headman anymore. What
are we going to do to send this headman?

1203
01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:22.000
Very simple.
We have a century-old tradition.

1204
01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:24.720
You will call the headman
to the square. you will quarrel.

1205
01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:26.520
No. uncle ihsan. don't talk nonsense.

1206
01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.016
Are we going to shoot a man in
the village square from now on?

1207
01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:31.320
We can't shoot like that.
I can't hold a gun. no.

1208
01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.736
Uncle ihsan. what are you saying?
Does such a thing ever happen?

1209
01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:35.920
What weapon? You
will have a love affair

1210
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.560
with words. not with
a gun. but with a saz.

1211
01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:40.240
No. no. I can't. Definitely.

1212
01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:42.440
I can't do it. uncle
ihsan. I certainly can't.

Recep ivedik. headman of yutan village.

1265
01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:12.520
Either there is a construction site and if you
send an authorized person. let's check this place.

1266
01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:15.680
Don't be silly. sir. What report?
What inspection?

1267
01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:19.480
Cut it out! Get your hands down!
The state is standing in front of you!

1268
01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:30.040
You know. I saw it the other day. a
man is carrying a plank. his friend is

1269
01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:34.320
the digger operator. he is panning
his friend with the tip of the bucket.

1270
01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:36.056
The man says what is going
on. I took a look in the air.

1271
01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.280
Does such a thing happen?
Is such a thing possible. sir?

1272
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.960
But the fish stinks from the head.
Here you are.

1273
01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:50.840
He's a very unworthy.
unqualified scumbag.

1274
01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:52.360
His uncle put this here.

1275
01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:54.456
His hand does not hold bread.
Are you a university graduate?

1276
01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:57.320
Brother. I graduated from
two universities in america.

1277
01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:01.080
Why didn't you study in Turkey?
Since you are such a Turkish citizen.

1278
01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:02.880
Why didn't you read here?

1279
01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.920
Ungrateful! What was
not enough for you here?

1280
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.736
They didn't buy it here. it's obvious to the school.
his uncle had it taught there with his money.

1281
01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:10.760
You don't have money for everything.

1282
01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:13.520
Rich baby la you.
La rich baby. filthy Baton Baton.

1283
01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:35.080
It has to stay a while. For him to feel.

1284
01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:43.320
Good day. are you picking?
They work double shifts 24 hours a day.

1285
01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:45.720
The men became like zombies.
Come check it out here.

1286
01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:49.240
Follow me sir. I told you. A
large number of uninsured workers

1287
01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:51.600
are employed in this
workplace. Let's give it a try now.

1288
01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:53.480
Do you believe?
Are you insured son?

1289
01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:56.840
- No. I get daily wages.
- Here you go.

1290
01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:58.120
My boss is lying.

1291
01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:59.976
This is a friend of this.
they know each other.

1292
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.200
Cut it out! The government doesn't lie!
Your name is on the back of it.

1293
01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:04.856
Is my name written here?
This is your name!

1294
01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:06.360

Hello. good day.

1298
01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.680
Hey. I was going to meet with an official.

1299
01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:19.800
Honorable minister. my respects.
How did they connect you directly?

1300
01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:22.736
I won't keep you busy. Shall we
transfer it to the private pen. minister?

1301
01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:24.960
Hello. Good afternoon. fire department?

1302
01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:28.000
It is necessary to conduct an audit.
I am the headman of yutan village.

1303
01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:30.840
There is a construction here.
Well. they have no preparations.

1304
01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:42.200
Huh. A fire extinguisher caught my eye.

1305
01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:44.040
Sir. you can see what you want.

1306
01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:47.280
Pre-construction friends have
already tested all of them. Is not it?

1307
01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:48.816
- Shall we tighten it. manager?
- Squeeze. squeeze.

1308
01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:49.840
Let's take it.

1309
01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:54.840
Pin it. I threw. Three. two. one.
Bass. it's empty.

1310
01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:57.960
- It's empty. look. look.
- Does it suit you?

1311
01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:59.320
Shame on you!

1312
01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:01.880
Is human life that cheap?

1313
01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:04.440
Where. I can't see the lightning rod?

1314
01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:05.816
It's not just you. I can't see it either.

1315
01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:08.216
Nobody can see it because it doesn't exist.
Where is the lightning rod?

1316
01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:09.256
Where is my son lightning rod?

1317
01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:11.576
Sir. we had it installed. but
they must have stolen it at night.

1318
01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:14.720
We did. we had.
We were obsessed.

1319
01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:16.840
I will be your lightning rod. my friend.

1320
01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:18.216
By Allah. did you eat the
lightning bolt to your brain?

1321
01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:20.360
They get 20 million volts
out of your ass here huh!

1322
01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:22.816
You'll be shining brightly here
at night. like a night light. huh.

1323
01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:24.656
Sir. there will probably
be a sanction for this.

1324
01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:27.920
Yes. the report is finished. If you sign
here. I read. I understand. your name.

1325
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.320
Skip the summer penalty. sir.

1326
01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:30.936
Unfortunately. I will write
an administrative fine for this.

1327
01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:32.960
Hurry! Administrative fine for you.

1328
01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:35.600
What if the general is
standing in front of you. general!

1329
01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:37.840
So is there a penalty
like this. but sir?

1330
01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.160
I'm closing this business
until I get the lightning rod.

1331
01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:42.296
- Oo…
- I will give information to the necessary places.

1332
01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:44.120
- Scramble the blackboard!
- Mr. Muhtar!

1333
01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:46.440
Hurry! Punish you here. Add!

1334
01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:49.840
Come on brother. come on. For god's
sake. please take this man with you.

1335
01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:51.536
- They put the punishment on you!
- Sir. please.

1336
01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:52.960
I'm so sorry. sir.
I am very sorry.

1337
01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:55.000
- Two days for him too.
- Add two more days.

1338
01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:58.280
They punished him for hashing.
Punish you for snapping!

1339
01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:01.760
Write. write. I will ask you.
My uncle will show you the rustling.

1340
01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:10.840
How did we become such
a nuisance to the men?

1341
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.480
You stand still. stand still.

1342
01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:15.240
When the ministry of
labor imposes a penalty on

1343
01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:17.880
them. then you see enver
çökelek's facial expression.

1344
01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:21.160
He will smash
his virtue. like this.

1345
01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:24.040
My only son. what kind of shit is he?

1346
01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:28.000
I also went into that toilet. I
swear you fucked up like a high five.

1347
01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:30.056
I've been holding it for
three days. for him. brother.

1348
01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:32.920
I swear you also left it
shaped like a python snake.

1349
01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.680
The inspector at the ministry of labor looked
at it and said I will ask for an assignment.

1350
01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:40.016
He said that this is not so. He said get
it from here like this with a vacuum truck.

1351
01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:43.080
Aha! Did that voice come from us?

1352
01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:44.160
I don't know bro.

1353
01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:47.416
My mother. the car is on fire. nurullah!

1355
01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:51.576
- Nurullah. we need to put this out!
- Don't come close. bro!

1356
01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:54.560
Nurullah the car is on fire!
The red devil is on fire. man.

1357
01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:56.576
- Brother. it explodes.
- It won't explode. nurullah.

1358
01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:59.160
- Explodes. explodes.
- It won't explode! Let's turn this off!

1359
01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:00.816
- Nurullah. my car is on fire.

1360
01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:03.696
- They'll explode. brother.

1361
01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:06.480
I say it won't explode. son.
It won't explode. it won't explode.

1362
01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:08.840
I had the gas tank of
the car made with a skid.

1363
01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:10.496
The warehouse is at home. it won't explode!

1364
01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:13.576
When I said I'm going to tell you something.
the car burned down and turned into ashes.

1365
01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:17.160
My god. my lord. the red
devil is on fire. the red devil!

1366
01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:21.440
Burned red devil!
Burned red devil!

1367
01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:29.280
You see. don't you. nurullah?

1368
01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:31.800
They burned the red devil like a Rose.

1369
01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:35.240
Look. it's still smoldering. smoldering.

1370
01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:39.920
Hey go hey. What memories
do we have with you. red devil.

1371
01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:43.320
Gungoren cauldron. you scoop. what

1372
01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:46.440
- Ah!
- Aha look who came. nurullah.

1373
01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:48.880
- Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa!
- Go turn off the water.

1374
01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:50.120
- How could it be?
- Burnt.

1375
01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:54.160
I was very sorry! I'm so sorry. how
could such a thing happen. asim?

1376
01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:56.656
My dear villager brother
recep. I mean. there

1377
01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:59.000
have been some
misunderstandings with you before.

1378
01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:01.880
there have been conflicts.
but you are my neighbor.

1379
01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:04.160
I mean. we're looking at
each other's faces here.

1380
01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:06.136
We will get through these
difficult times together.

1381
01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:09.000
As soon as we heard it. we immediately ran.
Is there anything we can do?

1382
01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:11.160
Thank you. thank

- Why did you come?
- I came to say get well soon. recep.

1384
01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:18.160
I mean. is humanity dead or not?

1385
01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.000
We have been acquainted for so many years.

1386
01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:24.160
I also moved to the private sector.
I'm at yutanbiance with Mr. Erdem.

1387
01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:26.080
Really? Best wishes.

1388
01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:30.840
Well. We wanted to grow a little as a
company. It was a very important addition.

1389
01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:32.960
Yes. yes. they added
you very well. erdem.

1390
01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:36.760
In other words. you have created a very nice
ambiance with two different types of curmudgeons.

1391
01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:40.160
Well done to you. Shh look at me.
They gossip about you in the village.

1392
01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:41.640
- About us?
- How so?

1393
01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:46.000
They say they have a relationship. Now I don't
know if it's financial or something else.

1394
01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:49.800
- Who says?
- Come. come closer. Come closer. I'll say your name.

1395
01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:53.080
- Ah!
- Walk. go! Go away!

1396
01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:55.320
- It's my fault when it comes to you.
- Walk go!

1397
01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:57.400
Sir. leave it alone. he is
an incompetent person.

1398
01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:01.240
Is there a retard in front of you?
Ha? God's idiots.

1399
01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:04.600
You see. don't you. nurullah?
Now we are completely sure.

1400
01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:07.000
There is a rule in the illegitimate realm.

1401
01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:10.560
Nurullah is the one who does
the first thing to get well soon.

1402
01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:13.880
E bro. then when the tube

1404
01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:20.120
What does that have to do with it?

You said come. we came. brother recep.

1418
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.240
We are at your service. master.

1419
01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:16.000
Let's hit it. let's break it. recep Abi.

1420
01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:18.600
Thank you. do not miss. Come with me.

1421
01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:27.480
Friends. we are starting our
hunger strike for our village.

1422
01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:32.080
Teacher. come on.
Let's take a nice video of us.

1423
01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:34.400
It's pathetic. it's a
heart touching video

1424
01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:36.360
about the human drama
here. Do you understand?

1425
01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:37.280
Ready bro.

1426
01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:41.360
Yes. you see. we tied
ourselves to the tree with chains.

1427
01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:44.600
For what? We are doing all
this to stop this construction.

1428
01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:46.200
We started our hunger strike.

1429
01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:48.680
We expect the intense
interest of the press here soon.

1430
01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:52.440
We will not give up. if necessary.
you will find our bodies tied

1431
01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:55.920
and in chains. but we will not
give up on this hunger strike.

1432
01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:57.736
- Did you captured it?
- I took it bro.

1433
01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:00.416
Ok. very nice. You organized the
full participation press. didn't you?

1434
01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:02.760
I told them all.
I texted each and every one of them.

1435
01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:06.080
Very nice. Look at me son.
This strike is a very serious strike.

1436
01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:11.640
No matter what I say. don't
worry. you're not unraveling us.

1437
01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:13.640
- Okay bro. we got it.
- Deal?

1438
01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:16.440
Hunger can create all
kinds of states in a person.

1439
01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:18.520
It makes me particularly aggressive.

1440
01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:19.880
I can threaten you.

1441
01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:22.480
I say I'll cut off your
head. I'll stab you. I'll

1442
01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:25.000
tell my master. I'll lay
you under the tree. I say

1443
01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:26.760
I'll say all kinds of things. wait for me.

1444
01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:29.160
But you still don't solve
it. do you understand son?

1445
01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:30.616
All right. recep brother. we have a deal.

1446
01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:32.880
It only takes two things
for you to untie us.

1447
01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:34.480
Fainting and death.

1448
01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:36.800
We want to go
all the way. got it?

1449
01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:37.960
Ok bro. we got a deal.

1450
01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:41.400
Ok. Come on guys.
May our gaza be blessed!

1451
01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:43.520
- Blessed be the chief.
- Blessed be the chief.

1452
01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:46.616
Shh. should we have had a drink of water before
we started? Have you started the strike son?

1453
01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:47.520
It started bro.

1454
01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:50.200
We couldn't drink water either.
our mouth is sticky on our tongue.

1455
01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:54.240
- No. what's going on here?
- They went on a hunger strike. Mr. Erdem.

1456
01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:56.000
- On a hunger strike?
- Yes.

1457
01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:00.160
What if he can't stand that chubby hunger. he already
eats the people next to him in that third minute.

1458
01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:09.960
- How many minutes has it been?
- Recep brother. it's been 47 minutes right now.

1459
01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:12.600
How about 47? How about 47 minutes?

1460
01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:15.296
Three and a half. four hours passed.
my stomach clock says so. my body clock.

1461
01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:16.320
It works just as well.

1462
01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:20.681
- Where is the press. son?
- I talked bro. they will come.

1463
01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:26.200
What about? What about?
What about the press?

1464
01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:28.800
He didn't come. Look.
my nerves started to play.

1465
01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:30.640
slowly. aggression
started. if you are aware.

1466
01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:33.000
Someone is coming. Someone is coming.

1467
01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:35.320
- What happened. sister?
- You're on strike?

1468
01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:37.440
We brought you food in case you're hungry.

1469
01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:41.440
- Sister. we are on hunger strike. hunger!
- It's okay. you can eat when you're hungry. gari.

1470
01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:45.160
Or do you not understand the word?
This isn't a normal strike. it's not.

1471
01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:48.120
You think this is a labor
union strike? Hunger strike!

1472
01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:50.120
It's not "you eat when
you're hungry. gari".

1473
01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:53.160
We can't eat when we're hungry. gari!
We can't eat when we're hungry. gari!

1474
01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:56.360
We try not to eat.
you bring trays of food.

1475
01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:58.440
They also put
chicken on bulgur pilaf.

1476
01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:01.640
Are you trying to be a hindrance to us.
are you trying to be a support. ladies?

1477
01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:04.200
- Please go.
- What do we know. dear?

1478
01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.480
Please. Not this way. but yeah.

1479
01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:12.440
Shall we take a spoon?
Shh. let me get a spoon from him.

1480
01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:15.080
Come here.
Give me a chicken leg.

1481
01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:18.080
- Well. I can't do it. son. untie me.
- No.

1482
01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:19.760
- Untie me. son.
- No. recep brother. no.

1483
01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:21.400
- Solve it.
- Not possible.

1484
01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:25.440
God give me Patience.
God. give me strength.

1485
01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:41.280
Aa… a… nurullah. Nurullah.

1486
01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:42.840
Yes bro.

1487
01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:45.200
- Are you eating lentil meatballs?
- What patties?

1488
01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:48.360
- Are you eating lentil meatballs?
- What meatball bro?

1489
01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:50.640
Come on. the ball exploded?

1490
01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:53.176
Is it the ball? It's not ramadan.
it's nothing. what ball bro?

1491
01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:55.360
The ball just exploded. Wow. it exploded.

1492
01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:58.880
God give me Patience.
How are you guys. are you okay?

1493
01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:01.080
We are fine. We are
used to hunger. brother.

1494
01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:02.936
- We are super. brother.
- We're fine too. chief.

1495
01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:04.800
You're used to my shit. my shit!

1496
01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:08.040
On the long road. you stop and drink
soup at every facility every 45 minutes.

1497
01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:13.000
I'm done. untie me son. Untie me son.
How many hours has it been?

1498
01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:15.840
- Recep brother. we passed five hours. brother.
- How much?

1499
01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:20.960
- Pst. What are you doing here son?
- Are you talking to me right now?

1500
01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:23.561
- I'm talking to you. yes.
- I'm fine. what are you doing?

1501
01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:26.040
Oh well. what should I
do. I just went out to graze.

1502
01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:28.600
We are also on a hunger strike.
- Good. take it easy.

1503
01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:30.480
What are you eating son?

1504
01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:32.376
Give it to us too. I love your
eyes. we are very hungry.

1505
01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:34.560
I can't give it.
Aren't you on strike?

1506
01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:36.280
Give me some goat cheese.

1507
01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:40.320
What about recep. who lost the goat
cheese and who finds it. for god's sake?

1508
01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:45.800
But a nice baked beans for you.
a nice buttered rice with it. okay?

1509
01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:49.440
It says beans. What dried beans… it is very
difficult. Do you have any dried beans?

1510
01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:54.320
Run to the village. run gallop. run to
the village. bring beans. Quadruple run.

1511
01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:56.560
Okay. okay. okay. Let's take it easy.

1512
01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:59.560
Recep brother? Receptionist?

1513
01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:01.120
- Sorry?
- Rep bro.

1514
01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:03.760
- Sorry?
- Who are you talking to?

1515
01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:06.960
- Son. weren't you a goat?
- No. bro. What goat?

1516
01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:09.040
Your adjective was goat just now.

1517
01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:11.400
I swear I saw a goat.
You were just a white-bearded goat.

1518
01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:14.080
Brother. recep brother.
Look. you're not good at all. huh.

1519
01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:16.016
So your head is pretty much gone.
Come to yourself.

1520
01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:18.400
I've been very bad. my son.
Untie me. I've been very bad.

1521
01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:19.880
I just saw you goat.

1522
01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:23.880
I started a conversation with you as a
goat. Untie me. I've been so bad. please.

1523
01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:26.536
No bro. we talked about it. you
said don't solve it. I can't do anything.

1524
01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:30.080
Okay. I'm telling you solve it now. Right
now. I'm telling you to untie me immediately.

1525
01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:32.560
But recep brother. we talked
about this too. You said solve.

1526
01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:36.120
I said that too. I said untie me!

1527
01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:39.016
I'm the one who said that.
I'm the one who said that too.

1528
01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:42.520
If I told you to untie me. you will
untie me. Who gave you that order?

1529
01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:44.920
-You gave it. bro.
I'm giving this order too.

1530
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.176
Okay. but you said that too.
If I say that. don't solve it. you said.

1531
01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:49.040
Are you going to make me hurt me?

1532
01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:51.640
I'm giving the order.
Untie me right here.

1533
01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:54.800
You said don't solve it except death
and fainting. That's why I don't fix it.

1534
01:18:54.880 --> 01:19:00.240
God. give me Patience.
Aa. something is happening to me.

1535
01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:06.120
Aa. my brain is out of power right now.
Look. look. I'm going. look. slowly.

1536
01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:08.560
- Rep bro!
- Look. look. look. My eyes are slipping.

1537
01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:11.560
Rep bro!

1538
01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:15.360
- Brother. I'm here.
- Recep? Recep? Passed out. sir. Solve. solve.

1539
01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:17.680
Chief. come to your senses. Head?

1540
01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:20.240
Uff.

1541
01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:24.080
Well. hunger strike is not for me at all.
The press had no interest at all.

1542
01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:28.160
Nor was it created a sensation.
We floundered there for nothing.

1543
01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:30.360
We urgently need to find
someone famous here.

1544
01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:32.000
Otherwise. the press is not interested.

1545
01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:34.216
Brother recep. a friend of mine
works for the company that makes

1546
01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:38.720
rsvps to galas. I think he
has it. let me ask you a question.

1547
01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:41.600
Wouldn't it be okay. son. if
your friend is already working

1548
01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:43.696
in rsvp. he has the whole
list. Tell me to send it quickly.

1549
01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:44.720
E. okay I'm asking.

1550
01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:46.456
Let me check quickly.
Write and send the list.

1551
01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:48.696
Quick. quick. quick. Did he send the list?
Has the list arrived?

1552
01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:49.720
I'm writing bro. stop.

1553
01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:51.856
Let me see if it came?
Have you got the list. son. look.

1554
01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:53.360
Hah. I sent it.

1555
01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:54.576
Is the list here. check it out.

1556
01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:56.240
My brother was sending it in two minutes.

1557
01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:57.800
Look son. it beeped beeping.

1558
01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:00.600
He trembled. my son. look at him.
Has the list arrived?

1559
01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:03.160
- Come on.
- Aha. it's here.

1560
01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:06.000
- Brother. I swear he's here.
- Give. give. give. give.

1561
01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:11.240
Aha. the list is here.
Let's start with the first now. Fazil say.

1562
01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:13.920
It's not alphabetical. is it?

1563
01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:17.680
Hello. Good day sir.
Is it cemal resit Rey?

1564
01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:20.680
Hey. would you look at the backstage.
I was going to meet with fazil?

1565
01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:24.520
Who is fazil? Fazil say. who will it be?
Who else is Turkey's pride?

1566
01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:25.760
Take a look. it's over there.

1567
01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:29.640
We also think that
there will be a social

1568
01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:30.896
responsibility concert
around yutan village.

1569
01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:34.320
Such a beautiful Meadow will put his piano
in the middle of the grass. it will rattle.

1570
01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:37.960
We will also call the press.
No. how can we find the piano?

1571
01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:40.776
We can't find the piano. No. we
don't have a piano. How does it not?

1572
01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:44.040
We invited a clarinetist to the last
wedding. he came with his own clarinet.

1573
01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:46.480
He will take his grand
piano. he will come. brother.

1574
01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:48.576
Is there an artist who does
not bring his own gold coin?

1575
01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:49.320
How big is it?

1576
01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:52.096
Whatever my brother has a big
tool. we are not interested in his tool.

1577
01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:53.440
It will ring here.

1578
01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:55.920
I can arrange org here. org.
Okay. close. okay.

1579
01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:00.000
Art basket. Empty works.

1580
01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:02.400
Hello. I was going to see tarkan.

1581
01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:05.760
We either have a social responsibility
business or in our yutan village.

1582
01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:09.656
Yes. There will be a construction here. there will
be natural slaughter. We are waiting for tarkan.

1583
01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:12.880
Can't come? E is going to hasankeyf.
He knew how to travel there.

1584
01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:16.320
He's singing "lucky. late". I swear
he didn't pass. So they passed us by.

1585
01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:17.880
Okay. ma'am. close. okay.

1586
01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:21.920
Hello. I was going to meet with ezel. Yes.

1587
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.680

responsibility?

1589
01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:29.040
We are planning such a concert
around yutan village for this trio.

1590
01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:32.400
Wow. it was an unforgettable trio.
Which trio? Ezel. celik. ercan.

1591
01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:38.120
It's ezel. Isn't it ezel's song. "we were going to
have a daughter. I'm on the road without my daughter."

1592
01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:41.040
Isn't that ezel? Is it special?
Who was ezel? Rapper?

1593
01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:43.560
No. no. no. we don't get rappers. no.
In Berlin?

1594
01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:46.600
No. I can't bring it from Berlin anyway.
I'll bring it from bolu at most.

1595
01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:48.760
Ok. Ok. Thank you.
Thanks. Thank you.

1596
01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:53.720
No brother. we couldn't meet
anyone on a common point.

1597
01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:55.560
Brother. I have a friend but…

1603
01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:10.120
What is he saying? What is he saying?

1604
01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:12.560
Hello murat. How are you?

1605
01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:15.320
I missed you too. brother.

1606
01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:18.160
Murat. I know that you
are warm to social projects.

1607
01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:21.800
E. we were going to invite you somewhere
to shoot a video. To yutan village.

1608
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.040
Will you be free? Can you come!

1609
01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:28.680
I already knew you were a nice person.
I'll put you in position now.

1610
01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:34.240
Deep down. deep down. my dear murat.
I love you. kiss you. Brother is coming.

1611

I swear you caught a mouse since
it was a cat. nurullah. Well done.

1612
01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:41.200
Uff. Look at this.

01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:49.040
Come to a place on time. brother.
Be a little human.

1616
01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:50.480
Brother murat is not like that.

- Aha. it's here. Aha. it came.
- I swear he's here.

1618
01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:55.640
I swear it came.

1619
01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:03.720
Nuro!

1620
01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:06.160
- Wow. grasshopper!
- You haven't changed at all!

1621
01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:09.920
- Oh! Welcome. Welcome.
- Thank you.

1622
01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:13.880
You forgot.

1623
01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:17.200
Let me introduce you. my friend recep.
My best friend from the neighborhood.

I thought you were huge. like

1628
01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:26.520
"keyhulan". you
were pretty bored.

1629
01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:28.120
You only have that song

1630
01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:31.720
"to the bottom. deeper to the
bottom" that song is so good.

1631
01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:34.720
Deeper. deeper.

1632
01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:38.160
Well. that's what I said already.
It's at the bottom. Deeper. deeper.

1633
01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:39.240
Thanks.

1634
01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:40.840

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:46.920
Well. okay. Where is that construction?

1638
01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:49.800
Sister aunt. you take a break

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:52.840
Not aunt. my manager. Ayşe.

01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:54.536
Manager. sit down to
the cafe late. your feet

01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:01.200
Well. what shall we do then.
let's go together. Here you go.

1644
01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:06.480
Wow. wow. wow!
They destroyed the beautiful forest.

1645
01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:08.920
How do you sing with
your artistic sensibility?

1646
01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.320
They pretty much fucked up in the forest.

1647
01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:13.680
They destined it. That's why we called you.

1648
01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:15.800
We invited a valuable
voice artist like

1649
01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:18.120
you. who has millions
of followers. here.

1650
01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:21.920
With such a sad. emotional
awareness video. do you understand?

1651
01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.680
I'm with yutan village. i'm
against this yutanbiance. we need

1652
01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:29.640
to shoot a video like this and
gasp someone like yutan. murat.

1653
01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:32.560
Okay. so I can gas
that video to millions...

1654
01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:34.616
Oh. I ate your mouth.
Where shall we go. here?

1655
01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:36.760
Let's shoot a good video.
Come on bro. Get behind me.

1656
01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:39.560
- Has everyone got a seat?
- Aunt. you come too.

1657
01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:42.280
- A. no. no. I will not come.
- Is it good like that?

1658
01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:46.440
Hello dears. I'm in yutan village
right now and I'm very angry.

1659
01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:48.720
You will understand why I am so

1660
01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:50.240
angry and you
will agree with me.

1661
01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:52.760
That disgusting project you
see behind me is destroying

1662
01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:56.640
this beautiful forest
and making it concrete.

1663
01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:02.000
A vile company called çökelek holding is
in the middle of these beautiful forests.

1664
01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:04.240
He made a project
called yutanbiance and

1665
01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:07.200
started to concrete
these beautiful forests.

1666
01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:11.440
Together with my peasant
brothers. we have come here to

1667
01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:14.360
resist so that these beautiful
forests are not destroyed.

1668
01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:18.720
Don't forget. #utanbiance. #defolçökelek!

1669
01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:22.040
- God damn you all!
- Thank you.

1670
01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:24.560
- Brother. your hit was great.
- Thanks.

1671
01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:27.896
By god. I thought you wouldn't be able to finish
it either. but you put it together very well.

1672
01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:29.576
By the way. it's like
I told your followers

1673
01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:32.320
to goddamn it.
you can fix that too.

1674
01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:34.840
Shh. look. come
on. post this nicely

1675
01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:36.680
so that millions can
see this. come on.

1676
01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:37.920
Well. what time is it now?

1677
01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:41.000
What are you going to
do. share the time. son.

1678
01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:42.400
Let's put it on at eight o'clock.

1679
01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:45.840
Because it's eight prime time times.
That is when you have the most interaction.

1680
01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:47.400
Are you the national channel. son?

1681
01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:49.920
You are a romantic
prince in this country once.

1682
01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.000
You have the freedom to
put it wherever you want.

1683
01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:54.576
whenever you want. however
you want. to whomever you want.

1684
01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:56.360
It's not me. you.
Shall I put it or you?

1685
01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:59.920
Don't you put it? This is how it is. Put
this on. come on. Let me love your eyes.

1686
01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.320
Okay. let's do it this
way. trust me. I'll tweet at

1687
01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:05.520
eight o'clock that I'll
have very important news.

1688
01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:07.600
After that. I think this will be over.

1689
01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:11.680
Well. if you're the master of this business.
then it's worth listening to. Isn't it nurullah?

1690
01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:15.200
After all. when we call a water heater to
our house. we trust him. It's the same head.

1691
01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:17.520
Good luck to your heart. i'm
glad you came. my brother.

1692
01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:19.480
Thanks. E. is that all nuro?

drink well. let's take us somewhere.

1694
01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:24.800
Well. the man is right.
Shame on you.

1695
01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:27.760
Why are you friends with this ox?
You will hang with me. murat.

1696
01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:29.840
Stick with me. live your life.

1697
01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:31.456

How did you like the place?
I built you a riverbank.

1702
01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:43.440
It couldn't be more beautiful.

You can't see it in your dream. you see it in your
place. you sit at your table. you see it. don't you?

1708

We will provide a very good
service. do not embarrass us.

1709
01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:05.080
Do not worry. Brother. what should
I make you do. what would you like?

1710
01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:10.160
Now let's do it this way. you

1711
01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:11.920
Let it cook in a heavy fire. we will talk.

season. we don't have it right now.

1725
01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:47.800
How is it not the season of mushrooms? On
the way… mushrooms are everywhere. we saw it.

1726
01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:50.760
- But I'm not sure about them.
- What do you mean. I'm not sure bro?

1727
01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:52.816
The swallow mushroom we know.
We have been eating since childhood.

1728
01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:54.560
- Is it a lie?
- What we always eat.

1729
01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:57.216
Are we going to say no? Are we going
to say no to the customer? Go collect it.

1730
01:27:57.240 --> 01:27:59.056
It's none of my business. I'm
not taking any responsibility. man.

1731
01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:01.376
- Okay. okay. don't get involved. Go collect it.
- Alright.

1732
01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:03.856
But what if we don't eat what we don't
know? The man says he is not sure.

1733
01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:04.920
No sister. no.

1734
01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.640
The mushroom we know. the mushroom we eat.
It's what we always eat.

1735
01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:11.560
And we're going to wrap the pine cone paste.
Vegan pine cone paste. so we are suckers.

1736
01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:15.960
Wow. We're sitting on the bank of
that river with the huge murat dalkılıç.

1737
01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:17.600
Did it ever occur to you?

1738
01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:20.240
Murat. I will ask you a
question if it is not private.

1739
01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:22.160
- Of course.
- Aunt. plug your ears.

1740
01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:24.920
Who are you hanging out with
from this art community now?

1741
01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:27.800
- Come on. let me love recep's eyes.
- Tell me. tell me.

1742
01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:30.616
At the beginning of forty years. we
come together in this beautiful place…

1743
01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:33.320
tell me. tell me. Here we are us.

1744
01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:35.800
- No no. Ok.
- Well. let's not force it.

1745
01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:41.240
Recep. mushroom is also mushroom.

1746
01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:44.480
I had it specially made for you.
I sautéed it in a casserole.

1747
01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:46.680
- Will you take my sister?
- E. thank you. thank you.

1748
01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:49.200
- See death.
- I won't eat bro. thank you.

1749
01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:52.000
He cries. He cries. He cries.

1750
01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:54.240
I won't take it. pull it out.

1751
01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:56.600
What about your eyes. my love?

1752
01:28:56.680 --> 01:29:01.160
You found such a fresh. crimson mushroom
at the beginning of forty years. Eat it!

1753
01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:02.240
I will not eat murat.

1754
01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:04.600
You ate too much too.
stop eating this. please.

1755
01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:05.520
Imm.

1756
01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:09.080
My dear. whoever eats
this mushroom. regrets it.

1757
01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:11.120
- and the one who doesn't eat it regrets it.
- Ah!

1758
01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:13.000
- My mother!
- What happened?

1759
01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:15.496
- What happened?
- My mother! My mother. my mother. my mother.

1760
01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:16.680
What happened murat?

1761
01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:19.360
Mom. I have a pain in the
back of my head. right here. stop.

1762
01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:22.480
Where exactly?
What happened to you murat?

1763
01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:24.640
What should I know. ayşe?
It came in from somewhere.

1764
01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:26.176
-A. a. a!
It may be an ohmicron variant.

1765
01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:27.280
Moon! Moon! Moon!

1766
01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:30.400
Gee. What happened murat?
Try to explain it to me exactly.

1767
01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:32.456
-Ah! I do not know.
The child cannot put it into words.

1768
01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:34.320
What is happening to you murat right now?

1769
01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:38.560
My eyes… is it dark now?
Is it dark now?

1770
01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:41.760
- Murat. what darkening?
- No. it's bright. murat.

1771
01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:44.640
Look at me. Murat?
Murat. what's wrong with you?

1772
01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:46.440
I guess he doesn't
see. the boy looks blank.

1773
01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:48.800
Murat? What's going on. murat?

1774
01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:52.400
Murat. I'm calling ercan right now.
we're going to the hospital right now.

1775
01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:55.040
- Where is the nearest hospital here?
- There is a clinic nearby.

1776
01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:57.480
Ercan. bring the car
quickly. I'm taking murat out.

1777
01:29:57.560 --> 01:30:00.080
- Don't worry about that.
- Ercan. bring the car!

1778
01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:07.200
Please follow the light.
Do you see the light?

1779
01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:10.000
I really don't see anything. doctor.

1780
01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:11.560
Can't you see this light?

1781
01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:13.600
There seems to be a slight glow. Came.

1782
01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:16.920
Gone. Came. Gone.

1783
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.760
Coming. Gone.

1784
01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:20.880
- Oh murat. oh!
- Understood.

1785
01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:23.680
There is no neurological finding.
It may be poisoning.

1786
01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:26.440
There may be nerve palsy
due to a toxic substance.

1787
01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:28.800
Did you eat anything?
Like that. something different?

1788
01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:31.400
Here we ate mushrooms. and
then we ate that cone paste.

1789
01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:33.560
I told you. murat. not to eat these.

1790
01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:36.680
Was yours red with
white spots like this?

1791
01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:38.160
Maybe it was something like that.

1792
01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:39.640
Yes. it was something like that.

1793
01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:41.240
That's the dangerous kind.

1794
01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:46.560
Oh. they poisoned! They poisoned my chalky
eyes. they poisoned me. Without pity.

1795
01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:50.960
What if this man's left eye is 20 million
dollars and his right eye is 30 million dollars.

1796
01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:53.280
But he was poisoned. They poisoned it.

1797
01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:57.680
No. darling. it's fine.
But of course we were afraid.

1798
01:30:58.120 --> 01:31:02.600
Uff! It was half past eight.
No more videos. nothing.

1799
01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:04.440
We shivered. yes.

1800
01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:08.200
I'm going to talk to this guy's meningitis
and I'm going to make him shoot this video.

1801
01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:12.600
No. my love. don't worry.
Murat is fine. everything is fine.

1802
01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:16.040
- Shall we hang up? I will talk something.
- I'll call you later. okay?

1803
01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:17.080
I'll call later.

1804
01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:21.640
Madam. I'm interrupting you
with honey. it's half past eight

1805
01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:24.096
o'clock. there was this video of
ours that murat bey will share.

1806
01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:25.440
come on. share this now.

1807
01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:27.816
He said eight o'clock. he said
prime time. they all ran away.

1808
01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:30.400
Let him post this before he
runs away and let's make a mess.

1809
01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:32.040
Let's come with a bang. huh.

1810
01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:35.600
My brother is in the hospital.
he is blind. do you realize?

1811
01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:38.880
I hope it will fix.
It's ours. not that video. please post it.

1812
01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:41.880
Come on. Go talk to him and
he's still holding the hand. take

1813
01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:43.896
your hand like this. hit the
phone like this and press the post.

1814
01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:44.960
Come on. I love your eyes.

1815
01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:49.360
Damn! The man went blind.
what post are you still talking about?

1816
01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:51.160
Do you post this video or not?

1817
01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:52.960
I don't. I do not share.

1818
01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:54.640
- You don't share?
- I don't share.

1819
01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:57.280
Shame on you! Shame on you.

1820
01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:59.400
Shame on artists like you.

1821
01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:02.800
We took you. we fed you. we drank you.
You also locked the account to us.

1822
01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:05.520
We ate and drank what?
Are you kidding me?

1823
01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:08.456
At least you weren't going to share the
video. why did you lock the account to us?

1824
01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:10.816
Isn't it shameful? We have three
cents of money. we are peasants.

1825
01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:11.920
Look. I'm going crazy now!

1826
01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.960
Get out of my sight. I don't
want to deal with you anymore.

1827
01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:17.000
Oh. look. don't let murat
stand up until tomorrow.

1828
01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:19.120
what am I going to do
with you. you'll see then.

1829
01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:21.120
Disgraceful bastards! Nasty bastards!

1830
01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:24.280
- Don't raise your voice!
- Ill mannered! Nasty bastard!

1831
01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:27.560
We pay for the banderol on
every tape. On every tape.

1832
01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:30.120
We've lifted you up with our tax.

1833
01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:31.680
Come here.

1834
01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:34.680
I will go inside. He
doesn't see it anyway. if

1835
01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:37.840
the phone is around.
I'll take it. I'll post it.

1836
01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:40.960
We're going to cut our own belt ourselves.
you understand? Get on the erket.

1837
01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:42.320
Ok bro.

1838
01:32:58.120 --> 01:32:59.120
Who did come?

1839
01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:00.520
Aisha?

1840
01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:02.880
Who is there?

1841
01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:07.440
Aisha?

1842
01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:14.160
I also started to hear
voices from the unknown.

1843
01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:17.120
What is this?
It says facial recognition.

1844
01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:23.240
It doesn't recognize my face.
Are we going to make this face read now?

1845
01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.000
What is this blackout?

1846
01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:31.400
No. it didn't.

1847
01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:34.840
Damn!

1848
01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:36.240
It didn't happen.

1849
01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:44.520
Damn! Something passes before my
eyes. a shadow passes by. I will go crazy.

1850
01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:49.000
Damn! Damn! Damn!

1851
01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:52.360
No. it doesn't. What a face. it
feels like. the phone doesn't read.

1852
01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:54.320
Murat. fuck that mushroom you ate. murat.

1853
01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:56.960
Damn!

1854
01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:01.200
Opened. Bye-bye. prime time.

1855
01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:05.960
Damn! Who is there? Look. don't
get on my nerves in this hospital.

1856
01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:08.880
Nurullah. I picked up the phone.
How are we going to share it now?

1857
01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:09.960
I don't know bro.

1858
01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:12.040
Is that murat's phone?

1859
01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:14.240
- Brother. the girl came.
- I saw. I saw the girl.

1860
01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:15.640
What are you doing?

1861
01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:18.760
Well. we're not doing anything.
The phone rang bitterly.

1862
01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:20.736
When there was no minister. the
boy was blind or he always looked

1863
01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:23.480
for the other side with his
hand. so I entered and opened it.

1864
01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:26.560
What are you talking about bro?
Give me that phone.

1865
01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:29.480
You're not going anywhere from here now.
Because I'm calling the police!

1866
01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:32.600
- Why? Why are you calling the police?
- For stealing.

1867
01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:33.800
- We?
- Yes.

1868
01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:35.600
Repent. shame on you.

1869
01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:38.280
I'm sorry. Call. call.
Call. call the police.

1870
01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:40.536
- I'm looking. I'm looking.
- Search. The police will not come.

1871
01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:42.080
- Why?
- This is the gendarmerie zone.

1872
01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:44.480
My god! I'm calling. you stop.

1873
01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:46.960
Then call telecom. connect fiber.
Okay?

1874
01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:49.216
You stop. don't go
anywhere. I'm looking. look.

1875
01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:53.000
Then call the coast guard.
come by land zodiac. Okay?

1876
01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:53.960
Look. I called.

1877
01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:57.880
- Wow. manager like you. Shame on you.
- Oh my god!

1878
01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:03.000
Yes friends.

1879
01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:07.000
We will jointly stop the
construction of çökelek holding here.

1880
01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:10.800
We have not been completely
successful in anything we have done so far.

1881
01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:14.560

We do not want this project
together with the villagers of yutan.

1902
01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:13.240
We don't want it!

1903
01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:15.440
We are resisting here
and will continue to resist!

1904
01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:19.080
The precipitate will go away!

1905
01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:22.640
The precipitate will go away!

1906

Black warehouse! The
corrupt forces are in front of you.

The position is clear. The
view is clear. Get in line.

Ah! What is this?

1918
01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:05.880

yutan's answer to you.

1921
01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:16.560
-We do not want this construction.
We will not cut our trees.

1922
01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:19.720
Our ancestors and
grandfathers left us these forests.

1923
01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:22.480
We do not sell these
forests. nor will we sell them.

1924
01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:23.840

01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:29.680
Very little. 278. You have to speed up.
Speed up. Speed up. pace. Tempo.

Don't be stunned. don't lose our Patience!

01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:49.760
We are peasants. we are right. we will win!

1950
01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:53.920
Let's see. lion! Beautiful.

1951
01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.480
- Rep bro! Recep bro! Recep bro!
- I'm in the game. son.

1952
01:38:57.560 --> 01:38:59.480
- Brother. it's very important.
- Ok. say.

1953
01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:01.456
Brother. according to the
intelligence I got. foreign

1954
01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:04.120
investors will come to see
the construction tomorrow.

1955
01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:07.400
They would tour the field. So. you
understand. the situation is very serious.

1956
01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:11.280
Look. you. So it invites foreign
investors to the construction.

1957
01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:14.320
The jackal will find money
and speed up the construction.

1958
01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:16.960
Guys. then I say to these
incoming investors. let's

1959
01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:20.240
have a nice black warehouse
welcome ceremony. Say what?

1960
01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:23.760
Let's show Turkish
hospitality. Mr. Recep.

1961
01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:26.720
I've hurt their heads all over. chief.

1962
01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:29.016
No. there is no such thing
as mouth-nose-breaking.

1963
01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:32.000
We're just going to open the black
warehouse horror package for them.

1964
01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:33.920
We're going to make a
nice horror arrangement.

1965
01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:36.720
Let them be afraid that they
will run away with their heels.

1966
01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:40.320
Guys. this is just welcoming.

1967
01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:52.360
Dear friend. here is our sample
villa that we talked about in the project.

1968
01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:54.200
This is our sample villa.

1969
01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:56.000
- Impressive design. isn't it?
- Uh huh.

1970
01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:58.320
He has a very
impressive design. he says.

1971
01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:01.400
Beautiful. So let's
move on to the woods to

1972
01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:02.776
talk about the rest of
the project. Here you go.

1973
01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:04.560
Sure. let's
go and see. yes. yes.

1974
01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:10.240
Please Michael. look! A very nice place.

1975
01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:14.680
- It's a beautiful place. isn't it?
- Wonderful!

1976
01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:18.680
But trees are very frequent. So. you're
going to have to cut down some of these

1977
01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:22.600
trees to build a vacation resort here.
How do you intend to solve this problem?

1978
01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:23.920
Many trees.

1979
01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:27.280
Don't panic.
we'll cut it off in a crack.

1980
01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:30.360
We start three days.

1981
01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:34.160
Hmm. three days huh? You're too fast!

1982
01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:38.120
But you know. in
the usa cutting trees

1983
01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:39.880
is a big deal. the
laws are very strict.

1984
01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:42.800
Do you expect any problems
during this operation?

1985
01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:44.840
About the villagers or the media?

1986
01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:49.400
We Turks have a very
famous saying; We'll handle it!

1987
01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:52.680
- Don't worry. it's all set.
- Perfect.

1988
01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:55.320
Don't worry. that's
the easiest part anyway.

1989
01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:58.040
These are peasants. These are ignorant.

1990
01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:02.400
If they take two cents of money. they
will sell their field. land. house. bark.

1991
01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:05.480
They're already fed up here.
They are the simplest.

1992
01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:09.720
You don't need to worry about the
media either. We already have them all.

1993
01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:12.320
They can't make
headlines without asking us.

1994
01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:15.800
We feed them all well.
We do all the work very easily.

1995
01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:21.720
Project fifty villas. But we
will build one hundred and fifty villas!

1996
01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:24.720
- How?
- Wonderful.

1997
01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:26.400
- Hocus pocus.
- Hocus pocus.

1998
01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:31.440
- Wow. wow. wow. wow.
- Aha!

1999
01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:36.360
Wow mom. Wow mom.
Wow mom. Who do I see?

2000
01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:38.600
- Who is this?
- He's a crazy peasant.

2001
01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:43.160
Big businessman erdem
çökelek and his saz friends. huh?

2002
01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:44.560
What are you doing here?

2003
01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:47.840
Are they American. huh?
How about you guys?

2004
01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:51.840
What do you nine here?
What your near. huh?

2005
01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.080
What is he
saying. I don't understand?

2006
01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:55.160
It's ridiculous.

2007
01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:56.936
My son does not
understand that these are in English.

2008
01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:00.600
I say what are you doing. he doesn't answer.
Shouldn't these be outsourced like you?

2009
01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:01.936
Did you come again troublemaker?

2010
01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:04.936
Look at me. I'll Bury you in the middle of
this construction. Did you understand me?

2011
01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:06.480
You scared us. you took our minds.

2012
01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:10.880
I'll take your mind. open
your brain. put it on a plate.

2013
01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:14.080
I will throw onion. garlic.
chili pepper and sumac on it.

2014
01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:15.160
Plug. plug. plug. plug!

2015
01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:18.040
I will cut cold cuts and serve.
izmir style. You wait longer.

2016
01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:18.920
Go go!

2017
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.400
You've been talking here all along.

2018
01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:23.680
You say hocus pocus. huh?

2019
01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:26.520
We listened to the
subject of trees. villas. etc.

2020
01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:29.760
I just wanted to give you a
hocus pocus. Look. watch now.

2021
01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:31.160
Look at my hands.

2022
01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:34.216
Look at my hands. Take a good look
at my hands. Look. look. look. Do you see?

2023
01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:36.560
Look. look. look. Look what's
going on. Ah what is this?

2024
01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:38.280
Look. he made the same move again.

2025
01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:40.600
Look good. Ha!

2026
01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:41.920
- Aha!
- Oh!

2027
01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:43.776
- Yeah.
- Where did these come from. son?

2028
01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:46.520
- I don't know. sir.
- What happened? You were astonished.

2029
01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:49.320
You have a mind.
One of your eyes popped out.

2030
01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:52.080
Uh. Michael? Jonathan?
How beautiful. isn't it?

2031
01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:55.360
Cut the trees here as you wish.
Oh what a homeland.

01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:02.880
Given Rose. taken Rose.
Isn't that what it's called?

2035
01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:05.440
Given Rose. taken Rose. huh?
Is it that easy?

2036
01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:08.256
Who are they? Take my
Rose. give my Rose. what does that mean?

2037
01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:09.800
My son. take them away.

2038
01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:12.120
Fuck off.
We have no business with you. Fuck off.

2039
01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:13.920
Do not. Don't go somewhere...

2040
01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Where are you going son!
Peace. come here.

2041
01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:17.840
Let's give this dog a ride first.

2042
01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:20.296
- Come. let's take you around.
- Look at me. let my uncle know!

2043
01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:23.560
- Inform the gendarmerie! Save me!
- All right. son. Let's fly. let's fly.

2044
01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:27.400
He flew. he flew. He flew.
he flew. He flew. he flew.

2045
01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:31.280
Let me go! What kind of people are you?

2046
01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:35.080
Let me go. Leave. Leave.
Download me. Download me.

2047
01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:37.600
Let's get that jacket so nothing happens.
It looks expensive.

2048
01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:39.640
Why are you taking my jacket?
Let me go.

2049
01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:41.080
- Calm down. calm down.
- Leave it.

2050
01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:42.240
Let's tie hands.

2051
01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:44.016
- He's also shamelessly rude.
- Let's tie hands.

2052
01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:46.096
You know. I'm going to
tell my uncle. he'll kill you.

2053
01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:47.896
- Calm down. my dude.
- You will crawl in jail.

2054
01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:49.600
- Did you understand me?
- Turn it over!

2055
01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:51.080
- Leave it. Ah!
- Come on!

2056
01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:53.520
- That's it. Let's see.
- Do not! Look. my hair will break.

2057
01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:57.240
- A. Two. Three.
- Do not! Do not!

2058
01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:05.840
They are rude. Bastards.
And you're laughing.

2059
01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:07.160
What kind of person are you?

2060
01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:09.520
By Allah. it was
exactly as his uncle said.

2061
01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:11.080
Fifteen years made a difference. huh?

2062
01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:14.720
My uncle will make you
crawl in jail. you will see this.

2063
01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:17.080
Let's do what you do! Nasty bastards.

2064
01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:20.840
Well come on then. stay well.
Take care. see you tomorrow.

2065
01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:22.760
Let's run. guys. See you later.

2066
01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:25.800
Do not go! Where are you?
Don't leave me here.

2067
01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:27.400
Animals eat me here.

2068
01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:32.840
Help! I'm done!

2069
01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:39.280
- So you complained about us. huh?
- Of course I will. Who are you?

2070
01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:40.680
Who are you? Who are you?

2071
01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:42.880
I will show you who I am.
It's almost time. wait.

2072
01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:45.560
Then let us show you something.
Give me son.

2073
01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:49.640
Let's see. Here. burn it from here.

2074
01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:52.800
- Damn this is me!
- Hop! Don't touch son. just watch.

2075
01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:57.000
We start three days.
The project is fifty villas. But we…

2076
01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:58.920
Bastards.

2077
01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.600
You saved everything.
Dishonest bastards!

2078
01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:04.280
We found a bastard like
you. shall we not record it son?

2079
01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:07.400
Come on. complain now.
Please be. Come on.

2080
01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:11.240
The commander has arrived.
The commander has arrived.

2081
01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:14.840
- Mr. Erdem. get well soon.
- Thanks.

2082
01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:17.760
Now. friends have
taken their statements.

2083
01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:21.120
So I called you to take your
statement. Are you complaining?

2084
01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:22.920
E. now. sir.

2085
01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:26.440
Of course. while you were
away. we had a little talk with

2086
01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:29.080
friends here. and they already
apologized to me on apology.

2087
01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:31.960
Who apologized?
Repentance. no. none of us apologized.

2088
01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:34.800
Sir. we stand behind our action.

2089
01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:37.720
If this happens again. we will
take it again and throw it in the mud.

2090
01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:40.680
E. sir. now you know. we are neighbors.

2091
01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:43.456
So we're going to look each other
in the face. right? After this moment.

2092
01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:46.760
I think we should not prolong this
case at all. I'm not a complainer.

2093
01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:50.280
Mr. Erdem. there is a case
of assault. Are you sure?

2094
01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:52.920
Sir. I'm very sorry.
It's not assault. it's bullying.

2095
01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:57.200
No sir. no. Ok. I'm sure.
I'm not complaining about them.

2096
01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:00.480
- Hello good day.
- Have a nice day.

2097
01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:03.120
I came as soon as I got the news.
I am their lawyer. büşra altın.

2098
01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:04.936
What is the matter. what
happened? What is the complaint?

2099
01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:08.840
No complaints. lawyer lady.
You can get friends. Here you go.

2100
01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:11.360
Hmm. Ok. fine. Here you go guys.

2101
01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:14.200
Good evening. commander.

2102
01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:15.680
Be smart. let me see.

2103
01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.440
- Have a nice day.
- Have a nice day.

2104
01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:23.520
Here are the peasant youth. sir.
They think they are having fun.

2105
01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:31.200
I'm leaving here for two
days. look what happened.

2106
01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:33.616
I'm collecting you guys from
the corners of the police station.

2107
01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:36.440
If you hadn't come. they would
have left us anyway. büşra.

2108
01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:40.120
We have such a video that we
blackmailed erdem with this video.

2109
01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:42.600
- We tied your mouth.
- What video is that? Give me one.

2110
01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:49.040
The video where erdem talks
about all the filth of çökelek holding.

2111
01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:51.560
Dumped idiot while hanging
around with investors.

2112
01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:54.640
…but we'll make it 150 villas.

2113
01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:57.280
Three days. it starts!

2114
01:46:57.600 --> 01:46:59.920
We cannot use this video. This is garbage.

2115
01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:03.880
How is it garbage?
The man is officially revealing it here.

2116
01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:05.760
Take it. hold it by your ear. throw it in.

2117
01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:08.600
You took this video in secret.
No. this is unusable.

2118
01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.136
Of course we did it undercover.
How else would we shoot?

2119
01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:13.720
Dear recep. I guess I
can't explain myself to you.

2120
01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:16.160
There is such a thing
as kvkk. This is crime.

2121
01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:17.680
No prosecutor would accept that.

2122
01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:19.920
I cannot use it.
I can't use it as evidence.

2123
01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:23.440
How is this justice? How is this law?
What is kvk? Is that possible?

2124
01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:26.880
The man is frankly confessing here.
The man is confessing his guilt here.

2125
01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:28.376
Recep. will you calm down for a second?

2126
01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:30.480
Such law is not justice.
Right. law. justice!

2127
01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:34.160
It's not like that. it should sink to the
ground. Take this. hold it. give it to the court.

2128
01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:36.800
That's not how things work.

2129
01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:39.760
But I have an idea. Look. we

2130
01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:42.520
can't use that as
evidence. But…

2131
01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:45.600
- but?
- But…

2132
01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:47.440
but?

2133
01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:52.016
I don't understand anything.
you keep making eyebrows. büşra.

2134
01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:54.040
Uff. All right. I'm telling you.

2135
01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:57.280
We can leak this video to the Internet.
I'm not saying anything more.

2136
01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:01.080
He's right. I solve this with
vpn. I'll even upload it right now.

2137
01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:04.680
Take it son. upload it now. Upload now.
but don't let us lose track of you. huh.

2138
01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:06.640
You guys. upload these and let

2139
01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:10.240
this video hit all
news sites… abov!

2140
01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:13.480
How will these people break up?

2141
01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:17.480
They will see the inside of the whole
precipitate. People who will spit in their faces.

2142
01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:21.640
It will be a fire place. We're going
to make a fuss. we're going to rattle.

2143
01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:24.240
- What's going to happen?
- It will be very nice.

2144
01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:27.960
- There is only one very serious incident. büşra.
- What is it?

2145
01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:32.320
If you've noticed in the video. erdem
was saying we'll be here in three days.

2146
01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:35.960
Three days. They can come in at any time.

2147
01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:39.560
So from now on we will keep watch
in the forest with the black barn.

2148
01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:44.000
Seagull mustache. Go get some
stuff. meet me at the forest entrance.

2149
01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:46.120
We'll be on watch with you tonight.

2150
01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:49.240
- Thank you. chief.
- Come on. stay well.

2151
01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:00.680
Do you hear. fatih?

2152
01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:02.880
I hear it. chief.

2153
01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:05.520
The gray owl howls.

2154
01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:15.800
According to a belief. one
of the darkest nights in the

2155
01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:18.280
world. which is it. if a grizzly
owl howls three times...

2156
01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:22.280
…an orphan calf's
heart is broken.

2157
01:49:25.320 --> 01:49:26.320
Do you look at the mana?

2158
01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:28.280
Very beautiful chief.

2159
01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:32.400
At the moment. only the
wolves are standing. fatih.

2160
01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:36.000
Coyotes. dogs. everybody sleeps.

2161
01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:39.520
Your brother is tired.

2162
01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:42.160
I will rest now.

2163
01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:46.040
I'll have a little look at the ganyan tomorrow.
and then I'll go to bed. Take care of yourself.

2164
01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:47.320
Good evening. chief.

2165
01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:02.360
Are they sleeping?

2166
01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:05.040
What can I say. give them a nudge?

2167
01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:07.016
- Am I really poking?
- I think we should wake him up.

2168
01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:08.440
I guess nothing will happen. right?

2169
01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:11.760
Shst. Hello. Get up. Hey! Shst.

2170
01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:14.160
He's waking up.

2171

My mother! What's going on?

2172
01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:18.640
Stop bro.

- What support did you come to?
- To yutan village.

2176
01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:26.400
Did you come here to support?

2177
01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:28.720
Yes. we are also not alone.
We all came together.

2178
01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:32.200
Brother. the video has
already started working.

Exactly bro. We've
seen the video. It was tt.

Wow. wow. wow. wow. wow. wow. Would

2184
01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:54.680
I want to cry bro.

Our eyes are on the road. I kiss.

2190
01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:36.480
E… we fucked up. You wait here.

2191
01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:38.080
Welcome uncle.

2192
01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:40.040
What the hell is that?

2193
01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:42.720
You have disgraced our family.

2194
01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:46.320
You have disgraced our business.
What is it that we took from you?

2195
01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:48.040
Uncle. I am a victim of fate.

2196
01:51:48.120 --> 01:51:52.200
You see. Officially installed.
I was left in the middle of a conspiracy.

2197
01:51:52.280 --> 01:51:57.120
What assembly? What blackmail?
Is there a child in front of you. huh?

2198
01:51:57.960 --> 01:51:59.576
Estağfurullah uncle. what does that mean?

2199
01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:01.640
You talk about it
publicly because you're

2200
01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:04.880
an idiot. because
you're an empty talker.

2201
01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:06.640
Uncle. don't worry. I'll wrap up

2202
01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:08.440
the whole thing as
soon as possible.

2203
01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:13.120
What will you recover?
Normally. you can't make a bed yet.

2204
01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:17.400
Look at me. finish this job tomorrow.
This thing got out of control.

2205
01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:24.800
You start cutting tomorrow. You
will level the forest. erdem. Straight!

2206
01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:27.440
Understood. All right.
don't worry. uncle.

2207
01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:29.280
I will do as you wish.

2208
01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:31.696
By the way. I will say something.
we have been busy since you

2209
01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:34.320
came. we couldn't chat. How is
your mood? Is your health good?

2210
01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:35.960
Get out! Get out!

2211
01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:39.080
Are you kidding me?
Scoundrel. Get out. get out!

2212
01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:41.240
Good day uncle. take it easy.

2213
01:52:42.440 --> 01:52:44.760
- What are you doing here?
- Well. shall we say hello?

2214
01:52:44.880 --> 01:52:45.880
Oh. too.

2215
01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:54.080
Oh my lord. what an honor
it is to see you on the field.

2216
01:52:54.520 --> 01:52:55.520
Thank you. thank you.

2217
01:52:55.680 --> 01:52:59.640
Mr. Enver. my commission job was
interrupted and I did something for him.

2218
01:52:59.720 --> 01:53:03.680
E. there was a transfer process regarding
the school and the council of elders.

2219
01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:07.040
I would have an extra for this event.

2220
01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:08.040
What extra?

2221
01:53:08.120 --> 01:53:12.880
By extra I mean commission.
Either I handed over the common areas.

2222
01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:16.640
And you were going to give me
double commission. That was said.

2223
01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:19.840
Initiation commission.
Impolite bastard.

2224
01:53:20.120 --> 01:53:23.920
We're giving you food every day here.
What a worthless person you are.

2225
01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.400
Shameless. Don't you have any pain?

2226
01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:29.040
Mr. Enver. you are speaking slowly alone.

2227
01:53:29.640 --> 01:53:31.080
I solved this.

2228
01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:35.640
If it weren't for me. recep and the
lawyer woman would be making you horny.

2229
01:53:36.280 --> 01:53:39.400
Get out. you naughty bastard.
Get out. don't get me in trouble.

2230
01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:42.400
Come on. Get out.
You dishonest pimp. Fuck off!

2231
01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:45.560
Wow. So that's it.

01:53:45.640 --> 01:53:49.000
Thank you until you see
your work. then ya Allah.

2233
01:53:49.800 --> 01:53:52.080
I have two words for you. enver.

2234
01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:55.640
You have wronged the
most wrong person here.

2235
01:53:55.720 --> 01:53:59.760
Asım civan will not forgive the
one who wronged asım civan.

2236
01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:03.240
I'll bring a wick from your nose.
Shame on you.

2237
01:54:03.800 --> 01:54:05.600
Get out. Get out!

2238
01:54:05.680 --> 01:54:08.760
But I will write your name
on the mountains. enver!

2239
01:54:08.840 --> 01:54:10.200
- You bastard pimp!
- Do not worry.

2240
01:54:10.280 --> 01:54:14.960
I will bring wick wick in your nose.
Ah. I'm writing. I'll bring a wick.

2241
01:54:15.040 --> 01:54:16.040
Fuck!

2242
01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:20.200
Yes. dear yutan village resisters.

2243
01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:24.920
You have come this far with us to
protect this village and these forests.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:26.120
Thank you. exist.

2245

Bravo!

2246
01:54:32.520 --> 01:54:37.200
I hope this resistance will yield results and
we will take this çökelek holding from here.

2247
01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:39.440
With god's permission. we
will send them away. friends.

2248
01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:42.000
Bravo!

2249
01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:47.960
My older sister! My older sister!

2250
01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:51.200
You did not listen to every word!
This is the head.

2251
01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.720
Look. you're going to make
me ban teflon pan. huh.

2252
01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:56.720
I swear I will have
teflon pans collected.

2253
01:54:56.800 --> 01:54:58.640
- Ok you are right.
- Of course I'm right.

2254
01:55:00.680 --> 01:55:03.840
Oh look who's coming from there.
Junior çökelek.

2255
01:55:04.120 --> 01:55:07.840
Whoops!

2256
01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.200
I'm calling
out to the invaders here.

2257
01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:15.960
It's a crime you committed.
This is private property.

2258
01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:20.280
You can't just come by waving
your arms. set up a tent and camp.

2259
01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:21.640
Whoops!

2260
01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:23.840
Hoot! Hoot!

2261
01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:26.280
I give you 24 hours.

2262
01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:29.840
When I come tomorrow. if I
see even one of you here. I

2263
01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:33.480
will crush you with construction
equipment. trucks. dozers.

2264
01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:35.960
Whoops!

2265
01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:37.680
- Hoot!
- Come on!

2266
01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:40.080
God damn you… virtue!

2267
01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:43.240
- What?

2268
01:55:45.240 --> 01:55:46.240
Cut it out!

2269
01:55:46.520 --> 01:55:47.520
Hold this.

2270
01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:50.480
Yes. friends. you heard that bastard.

2271
01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:54.160
He says I will crush you.
I'll flatten this place. he says.

2272
01:55:55.080 --> 01:56:00.680
While we are here. no one can
flatten these forests or this village.

2273
01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:03.960
We will defend this place
with our lives. god willing.

2274
01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:06.520
Bravo.

2275
01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:18.720
Hop! Shoo! No. who are you looking at?

2276
01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:22.320
Well. I'm sorry. lawyer lady. the door
was open. so I came all of a sudden.

2277
01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:25.280
- I brought good news.
- Here. tell me. What. what happened?

2278
01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:27.520
I came here to make
a friendly speech.

2279
01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:28.920
Don't you?

2280
01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:33.160
We had a small argument with enver.
but he ended my employment contract.

2281
01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:36.440
Oh. woe. woe.
I'm so sorry. look at this now.

2282
01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:39.440
I couldn't lift a
little. I couldn't eat it.

2283
01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:41.480
I was spoken badly to my face a little.

2284
01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:45.200
I gathered my money.
I bought my personal items.

2285
01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:47.320
But I bought a little too much.

2286
01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:04.520
Forehead. See your good.

2287
01:57:07.320 --> 01:57:09.840
Does it contain company
information now?

2288
01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:12.160
Peh. What is not? There are all.

2289
01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:13.760
And you give it to me.

2290
01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:16.040
I have a life philosophy.

2291
01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:17.640
Is that so. what is it?

2292
01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:20.200
Enemy of my enemy is my friend.

2293
01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:24.720
They got the wrong guy.
Well. excuse me.

2294
01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:30.920
Man. I hope you are not lying.

2295
01:57:37.640 --> 01:57:38.880
Yes friends.

2296
01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:43.480
Tomorrow when they come
here. they won't find us here.

2297
01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:46.800
At midnight. we will clear
the forest in the morning.

2298
01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:50.920
They'll think we're gone.
So are we really going?

2299
01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:52.440
No!

2300
01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:55.160
- Shall we leave the forest to them?
- No!

2301
01:57:56.160 --> 01:57:58.360
We will retreat into
the forest. friends.

2302
01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.640
We will face them with the Crescent tactic.

2303
01:58:02.720 --> 01:58:05.080
Everyone will have a place.

2304
01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:08.680
Friends. the name of this
forest is the forests of yutan.

2305
01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:13.920
And I hope these forests will
swallow çökelek holding tomorrow.

2306
01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:15.960
- May our gaza be blessed!
- Blessed!

2307
01:58:24.720 --> 01:58:29.440
"…shut up. Threaten if necessary."
Wow. Whoa!

2308
01:58:29.880 --> 01:58:33.840
All of these will be accounted for.
What is that? Useless. Stop.

2309
01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:39.280
Did you do that too?

2310
01:58:40.480 --> 01:58:43.280
What? What? Now I'm done with you son.

2311
01:58:46.760 --> 01:58:49.320
Wow idiots.
Can something like this be mailed?

2312
01:58:49.400 --> 01:58:51.800
They are idiots.
I will burn you from here. from here.

2313
01:58:56.720 --> 01:58:58.256
- This is the construction site.
- I understand. chief.

2314
01:58:58.280 --> 01:59:00.040
It has two entrances. Here. Here.

2315
01:59:00.120 --> 01:59:02.400
Generally. we harass
erdem from here.

2316
01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:07.960
They will make two exits. From here they
will come out into the forest and down.

2317
01:59:08.040 --> 01:59:10.080
We will be scattered in the forest.

2318
01:59:10.160 --> 01:59:12.640
Spraying will be done
from right. left and middle.

2319
01:59:12.720 --> 01:59:15.640
They won't be able to see us here.
We will hide in the forest.

2320
01:59:15.720 --> 01:59:17.400
- You got it. right?
- I understand. chief.

2321
01:59:17.720 --> 01:59:21.016
What they spray from here will also come out.
and what they spray from here will also come out.

2322
01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:24.600
Everyone will swarm here.
The incoming prey will fall into our lap.

2323
01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:26.456
- Do you understand?
- I understand. chief.

2324
01:59:26.480 --> 01:59:27.920
- You got shit!
- I understand.

2325
01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:46.360
Ah! God damn it.

Ugh. Your voice sounds choppy.

I found their internal
correspondence.

I want you to move very quickly.

2340
02:00:43.240 --> 02:00:46.880
As one tree falls. you will begin

The campers have left the area. sir.
There is no one here.

02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:25.600
Of course they will go. they will go.

Understood. Mr. Erdem. Ok.

2358
02:01:55.200 --> 02:01:58.240
Can I just say one thing? Since we

2359
02:01:58.280 --> 02:02:01.000
My uncle will be very proud of me.
