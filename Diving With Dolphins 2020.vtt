00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:31.448
NARRATOR: Our oceans are
the lifeblood of our planet.

4
00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.208
My grandfather. Jacques Cousteau.
inspired the world

5
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.753
through his exploration.
sharing the mysteries

6
00:00:44.962 --> 00:00:47.589
of one of Earth's most important habitats.

7
00:01:07.818 --> 00:01:11.154
It was in that spirit that a team
of Disneynature filmmakers

8
00:01:11.655 --> 00:01:15.409
embarked on a quest to shed new light
on this hidden world...

9
00:01:20.664 --> 00:01:23.417
...and on one
of its most enchanting inhabitants.

10
00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:32.092
NARRATOR: For wildlife filmmakers.
the ocean presents the greatest challenge.

11
00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.194
It is unforgiving.

12
00:01:37.973 --> 00:01:40.684
And visits beneath the waves
are fleeting.

13
00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:51.903
Here. they will enter a realm
where they are not the masters.

14
00:01:57.284 --> 00:01:59.494
And they must be respectful of the locals.

15
00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:02.164
MAN: No. no. no. no. no!

16
00:02:05.334 --> 00:02:06.885
NARRATOR: The team's mission?

17
00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:09.504
To reveal what it's like to live...

18
00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:11.715
-...in a dolphin's world.

19
00:02:20.057 --> 00:02:24.061
In the Red Sea.
wildlife cinematographer. Roger Horrocks.

20
00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:27.230
is preparing to film
the main character of our story...

21
00:02:28.315 --> 00:02:29.650
bottlenose dolphins.

22
00:02:30.651 --> 00:02:32.819
He has filmed dolphins all over the world.

23
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.822
but it's his first time in this location.

24
00:02:36.948 --> 00:02:40.827
The key to his success
lies with scientist. Angela Ziltener.

25
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.997
Having studied them here
for over a decade.

26
00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:47.376
she is a virtual gatekeeper
to the Red Sea dolphins.

27
00:02:47.793 --> 00:02:50.379
Certainly. the dolphins are
probably one of the most

28
00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:52.422
charismatic animals
that you do get in the ocean.

29
00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:54.508
They're mammals.
people can relate to them.

30
00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:58.387
Um. they're very. you know.
they have a mammalian consciousness.

31
00:02:58.553 --> 00:03:01.348
So. we have a kinship with them.

32
00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:05.852
NARRATOR:
As a highly experienced free-diver.

33
00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:10.315
Roger certainly has the athleticism
to keep up with dolphins underwater.

34
00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:13.110
ROGER: Filming dolphins
is probably the most physical

35
00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:15.779
-because they are incessantly on the move.
-

36
00:03:16.697 --> 00:03:19.741
So. the biggest challenge
is really just keeping up with them

37
00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:24.246
and coming across those moments
of pure. beautiful interaction.

38
00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:29.876
It was massively helpful to have Angela.

39
00:03:30.168 --> 00:03:33.714
who has spent an incredible amount of time
in that location.

40
00:03:34.341 --> 00:03:36.842
Her knowing the dolphins
helped us tremendously.

41
00:03:38.427 --> 00:03:41.179
NARRATOR: Angela is
one of the few scientists in the world

42
00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:43.390
who studies them by scuba diving.

43
00:03:45.517 --> 00:03:49.813
It has allowed her to get to know
over 200 individual dolphins.

44
00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:52.232
-and allowed them to get to know her.
-

45
00:03:52.983 --> 00:03:57.279
ANGELA: To understand the animals.
you actually have to be one of them.

46
00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.449
That means not that you are
the animal itself.

47
00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:03.285
but that you are accepted in the group.

48
00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:09.291
You will actually see all the individuals
and that every dolphin is different.

49
00:04:10.292 --> 00:04:13.628
Every dolphin has their own personality.
like humans.

50
00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.339
-NARRATOR: The pod knows Angela.

51
00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:20.260
but will the dolphins accept
our strange new cinematographer?

52
00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:23.847
ROGER: I. kind of. knew
literally from the moment that I got in

53
00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:26.107
that this was a great opportunity.

54
00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:30.604
When those dolphins
were absolutely keen to interact.

55
00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:33.115
not only with each other.
but also with me as a cameraman...

56
00:04:33.315 --> 00:04:35.776
-...so that was just such a joy.

57
00:04:37.152 --> 00:04:40.739
Wild animals actually wanting
to be filmed. It was amazing.

58
00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:53.502
ROGER: The more we film.
the more we got a sense

59
00:04:53.668 --> 00:04:55.420
of how they operate as groups.

60
00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:59.049
You know. one thing that was very.
very marked for me

61
00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:02.761
was the degree of interaction
between the dolphins.

62
00:05:03.595 --> 00:05:06.890
It was astounding to see
how tactile they were.

63
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.269
ROGER: Dolphins spent time fin rubbing.

64
00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:13.563
and touching each other.
grooming each other.

65
00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:17.108
I thought initially
it was maybe a romantic thing.

66
00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:19.528
but actually. it's a bonding thing.

67
00:05:20.237 --> 00:05:23.323
They are emotional.
highly intelligent creatures.

68
00:05:23.532 --> 00:05:25.659
-very. very similar to us.
-

69
00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:30.872
NARRATOR: And it wasn’t long
before Roger spotted another example

70
00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:32.749
of their playful intelligence.

71
00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:40.298
ROGER: A group of juveniles just came in
and they were almost showing off.

72
00:05:40.924 --> 00:05:44.761
I remember that feeling of knowing
this is a unique piece of behavior

73
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.097
and probably never going to get
this chance again.

74
00:05:48.473 --> 00:05:51.101
NARRATOR:
They flick their fluke to clear the sand.

75
00:05:51.726 --> 00:05:54.104
exposing a piece of coral.

76
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.859
And voilà. a toy is born.

77
00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:12.873
Few animals spend so much time playing.

78
00:06:13.606 --> 00:06:15.150
yet this perceived playfulness

79
00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:18.003
might also be one of the ways
that young dolphins

80
00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.255
-practice their hunting skills.
-

81
00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:27.888
ROGER: You can just. kind of.
see that intelligence

82
00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:30.140
and that mischievousness
about them.

83
00:06:30.307 --> 00:06:35.729
and again. just such an incredible insight
into how intelligent these animals are.

84
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.611
I think dolphins just do it
because they absolutely love it.

85
00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:44.829
and they enjoy the skill
and the challenge.

86
00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:52.054
I think they do it
for the sheer fun of it.

87
00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:08.511
NARRATOR: Angela's research has revealed
another aspect of dolphin life

88
00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:10.555
rarely witnessed in the wild...

89
00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:13.099
sleeping.

90
00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:19.230
This group of dolphins
is so relaxed in her presence.

91
00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:21.816
they take a nap as she watches...

92
00:07:24.653 --> 00:07:25.904
and Roger films.

93
00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:34.037
Dolphins sleep
with just half the brain at a time.

94
00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:39.209
Half the brain needs to be awake
to remember to surf as to breathe

95
00:07:40.043 --> 00:07:42.629
and to keep an eye out for any danger.

96
00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:47.676
As a consequence
of having such active brains.

97
00:07:47.968 --> 00:07:52.347
wild dolphins. just like us.
need lots of sleep.

98
00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:57.268
ROGER: They do these beautiful movements.
synchronized movements where they

99
00:07:57.485 --> 00:07:59.237
come up and they go back down again.

100
00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:04.109
It's very. you know. very soporific.
very slow.

101
00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:07.278
Really. really beautiful to watch.

102
00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:11.241
It just felt very poetic.

103
00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:23.211
NARRATOR: Thanks to Angela.
Roger and the team

104
00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:27.924
are starting to get a taste
of what it's like to be a wild dolphin.

105
00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:33.430
Knowledge they will need to build on.
in the next leg of their adventure.

106
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:40.437
It was just an absolute privilege
to be... to have that kind of access

107
00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:45.316
to. you know. these animals on their terms
because they choose to be with you.

108
00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:47.694
You know. you can't force them
to be with you. and I think.

109
00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:50.280
you know. of all the locations I've dived.

110
00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:52.407
they were the most welcoming.

111
00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:56.369
um. and that was. you know.
something that I'll never forget.

112
00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:01.124
NARRATOR:
Roger has made filming dolphins look easy.

113
00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:06.129
but will cinematographer. Didier Noirot.
have the same luck in Hawaii

114
00:09:06.504 --> 00:09:09.257
filming the next main characters
of our story?

115
00:09:12.677 --> 00:09:13.970
Humpback whales.

116
00:09:18.349 --> 00:09:22.020
Hawaii is a very good location to film
humpback whales...

117
00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:25.398
because of the whale population.

118
00:09:25.857 --> 00:09:28.318
-DIDIER: You're sure to see whales there.
-

119
00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:32.739
DIDIER: Crystal clear water.
so. that's perfect place to film whales.

120
00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:38.661
NARRATOR: It is also here that every year.
the females give birth to their calves.

121
00:09:41.122 --> 00:09:44.292
And filming a mother and calf
is the team's first task.

122
00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:48.797
They set out aboard the Luckey Strike

123
00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:51.216
where skipper Tad Luckey

124
00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:55.011
and a group of scientists
led by Professor Joe Mobley

125
00:09:55.386 --> 00:09:58.515
are their best chance
for locating these family pairs.

126
00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:01.226
This is always a big challenge.

127
00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:04.354
You don't know what you get.
never in advance.

128
00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:06.147
These whales are so difficult.

129
00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:10.652
It's very tricky for the producer. I mean.

130
00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:14.572
NARRATOR: Finding a whale in Hawaii
is not that hard.

131
00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:17.826
but skipper Tad
has to find the right whale.

132
00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:19.911
and that's the challenge.

133
00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:23.790
DIDIER: To find the right whale to film.

134
00:10:24.374 --> 00:10:27.877
especially mom and calf.
I have no expectation.

135
00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:32.507
That means I never know
what I'm going to get on camera.

136
00:10:34.717 --> 00:10:38.221
NARRATOR: As part of Jacques Cousteau's
original expedition team.

137
00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:42.809
Didier has over 30 years' experience
filming whales.

138
00:10:43.768 --> 00:10:44.894
I have 200.

139
00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:48.606
NARRATOR: But each opportunity
is always unpredictable.

140
00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:53.486
Come on. Come on.

141
00:10:55.479 --> 00:10:57.406
NARRATOR: It is a mother and calf

142
00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:02.662
but will Mom accept Didier
as easily as the dolphins warmed to Roger?

143
00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:04.706
You can try.

144
00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:07.170
Go ahead.

145
00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:10.670
DIDIER: The difficult thing to film
when you film mother and calf

146
00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:14.716
is to get close. silently.
as close as you get.

147
00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:19.053
NARRATOR:
He uses a bubble-free rebreather apparatus

148
00:11:19.429 --> 00:11:21.097
to silently approach.

149
00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:29.480
And any whale that doesn't accept
Didier's presence is left alone.

150
00:11:33.886 --> 00:11:36.196
The team needs to find a friendly whale

151
00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:38.489
that is comfortable around a diver.

152
00:11:44.078 --> 00:11:45.205
Well. they just left.

153
00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:48.875
We were ready to go. but now they are far.

154
00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:53.129
NARRATOR: But attempts to film
another mom and calf...

155
00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:55.340
produced the same result.

156
00:11:55.882 --> 00:11:59.594
DIDIER: When you see mother and calf.
the mother is always very aware.

157
00:11:59.928 --> 00:12:03.473
She's protecting the calf.
so any unknown thing

158
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.351
like me would make her alert.

159
00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:08.728
Take two for nothing.

160
00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:14.234
NARRATOR: Another one gets away.

161
00:12:15.777 --> 00:12:19.113
-The mom and calf left.
-WOMAN: You have nothing. huh?

162
00:12:23.618 --> 00:12:24.619
Go.

163
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:33.302
NARRATOR:
Didier is becoming all too familiar

164
00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:35.755
with the backsides of mother whales.

165
00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:43.805
DIDIER: So. you have to keep trying.

166
00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:49.185
finding a whale. new whale.
and one that lets you come close.

167
00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:59.529
NARRATOR:
After a long. unsuccessful day.

168
00:12:59.946 --> 00:13:02.240
he makes one last attempt.

169
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.784
DIDIER:
By the way. this is the ninth time.

170
00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:09.998
NARRATOR: Then. a stroke of luck.

171
00:13:10.373 --> 00:13:14.210
Didier has found a playful.
approachable calf.

172
00:13:14.544 --> 00:13:18.506
DIDIER: You don't dive and go straight
for the mom with the calf underneath.

173
00:13:18.715 --> 00:13:21.384
You first have to make friends
with the calf.

174
00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:25.555
If the calf stays around you.
that he is not scared. then turns around.

175
00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:28.891
the whale will know down there.
even if she sleeps.

176
00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:31.227
you know. she knows that there is someone.

177
00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:34.564
but she knows the calf is happy
with this someone.

178
00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:37.025
so she may tolerate that.

179
00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:44.615
NARRATOR: And as it dives back
under its mother to rest.

180
00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:48.411
-Didier follows quietly.
-

181
00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:51.956
DIDIER: Now is the time.
because maybe after the whale will leave.

182
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:55.001
and I will lose her for good.

183
00:13:55.293 --> 00:13:58.629
So. I decided to swim very. very slowly.

184
00:13:59.088 --> 00:14:02.091
and without making any noise at all.

185
00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:09.015
NARRATOR: Mom watches him carefully.

186
00:14:09.682 --> 00:14:12.185
but she seems content
with him alongside her.

187
00:14:15.063 --> 00:14:17.148
Finally. success.

188
00:14:19.233 --> 00:14:20.526
Divers like Didier...

189
00:14:20.943 --> 00:14:24.947
are just humble visitors
in this vast undersea world...

190
00:14:26.616 --> 00:14:28.910
but even the most powerful of creatures

191
00:14:29.118 --> 00:14:31.537
will sometimes allow you
to get close to them.

192
00:14:35.124 --> 00:14:36.959
After weeks of persistence.

193
00:14:37.251 --> 00:14:41.047
the team finally succeeded in filming
a mother and calf.

194
00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:46.928
This mother's duty is to protect her calf
while it grows quickly.

195
00:14:47.261 --> 00:14:51.101
before the long migration
back to Arctic waters.

196
00:14:51.349 --> 00:14:53.643
As they travel between resting spots.

197
00:14:53.976 --> 00:14:57.772
the mother encourages her calf
to breach repeatedly.

198
00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:07.907
It may look like just some fun
splashing about.

199
00:15:08.314 --> 00:15:12.620
but it's key to helping the young calf
build strength and muscles.

200
00:15:13.214 --> 00:15:15.540
that also develops
their breath-holding abilities.

201
00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:34.308
The close bond
between a mother whale and her calf

202
00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:37.478
provide our filmmakers
with their first inroad

203
00:15:37.687 --> 00:15:39.647
into humpback whale society.

204
00:15:41.983 --> 00:15:44.861
Shallow coastal waters
are the perfect sanctuary

205
00:15:45.403 --> 00:15:48.239
for a young calf
to grow healthy and strong.

206
00:15:49.157 --> 00:15:52.452
Away from the dangers
found in deeper. open waters.

207
00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:59.292
But it is also where it will soon
be introduced

208
00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:01.461
to a greater whale community.

209
00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:03.713
a complex society...

210
00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:08.426
one our team
is just beginning to understand.

211
00:16:13.681 --> 00:16:16.100
To truly understand a dolphin's world...

212
00:16:17.059 --> 00:16:21.063
the filmmakers need to journey
to the very heart of their ocean home.

213
00:16:23.232 --> 00:16:25.526
To the foundations of the whole story.

214
00:16:26.694 --> 00:16:29.030
A delicately balanced ecosystem...

215
00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:33.618
that is sanctuary to millions
of incredible supporting characters.

216
00:16:35.703 --> 00:16:37.163
A coral reef.

217
00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:41.792
Capturing the intricacies
of this underwater world

218
00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:45.254
requires a great deal
of technical camera skill

219
00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:48.966
and an exceptional eye
for precision and detail.

220
00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:55.181
Cinematographer. Doug Anderson.
is the perfect choice for such a job.

221
00:16:56.807 --> 00:16:59.352
DOUG: We wanted to make that experience
of viewing the reef

222
00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:00.937
as immersive as possible.

223
00:17:01.103 --> 00:17:02.522
So. we tried different techniques...

224
00:17:02.813 --> 00:17:05.191
...as many things
as we could think of

225
00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:08.486
to try and get
more engaging photography.

226
00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:12.448
Uh. we used this underwater scooter.

227
00:17:12.615 --> 00:17:15.493
which is like a torpedo
with a propeller on it.

228
00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:19.664
to get that feeling of the dolphin
like gliding over the reef.

229
00:17:26.337 --> 00:17:29.131
We used a jib. which is like a camera
on the end of an arm.

230
00:17:29.298 --> 00:17:31.717
which allowed us to make
for very stable tracking moves

231
00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:34.220
over the coral reef.
and really try and bring

232
00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:38.808
the character of the individual species
that we wanted to include

233
00:17:39.175 --> 00:17:40.176
to the screen.

234
00:17:47.984 --> 00:17:50.898
Of all the underwater habitats
on the planet.

235
00:17:51.153 --> 00:17:54.198
it's coral reefs
that are the most overtly diverse.

236
00:17:55.491 --> 00:18:00.871
Just amazed by the color. and the life.
and beauty in front of me.

237
00:18:02.121 --> 00:18:04.333
Absolutely breathtaking when you're there.

238
00:18:07.128 --> 00:18:09.505
Intense experiences of life.

239
00:18:18.848 --> 00:18:21.225
I like to think of a coral reef
a bit like a city.

240
00:18:22.751 --> 00:18:24.826
The buildings are the corals.

241
00:18:27.398 --> 00:18:32.403
Those buildings provide homes
and habitat for countless animals.

242
00:18:34.639 --> 00:18:37.617
Every animal that lives there
is as important to each other

243
00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:39.035
as the next one.

244
00:18:40.494 --> 00:18:42.814
But there are very obvious animals
in the coral reef

245
00:18:43.247 --> 00:18:44.957
that do very important jobs.

246
00:18:48.878 --> 00:18:51.464
NARRATOR: Doug wants to find
key characters like these...

247
00:18:52.256 --> 00:18:54.675
to highlight critical links
in the community.

248
00:18:56.132 --> 00:18:59.180
These handsome devils
are the perfect example.

249
00:19:00.556 --> 00:19:01.974
Bumphead parrotfish.

250
00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:06.571
They are the local groundskeepers.

251
00:19:06.896 --> 00:19:10.207
clearing the reef
of dead algae-covered coral.

252
00:19:15.404 --> 00:19:21.077
Recently. as our oceans have warmed.
coral reefs have bleached and died.

253
00:19:22.078 --> 00:19:24.538
Reefs with parrotfish are quickly cleaned.

254
00:19:24.872 --> 00:19:28.501
and new coral can recolonize
so the reef lives on.

255
00:19:30.044 --> 00:19:33.756
Reefs that have lost
to their parrotfish rarely recover.

256
00:19:38.469 --> 00:19:41.430
Parrotfish are important
to maintain the health of the reef...

257
00:19:42.598 --> 00:19:45.309
but Doug also discovers
another important fish.

258
00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:49.522
The incredible. workaholic cleaner wrasse.

259
00:19:52.358 --> 00:19:55.361
DOUG: There are moments in the reef
where it becomes very obvious

260
00:19:55.528 --> 00:19:57.738
how controlled and complex

261
00:19:57.947 --> 00:20:00.574
the relationships
between the individual animals are.

262
00:20:01.027 --> 00:20:04.328
And one of them. for sure.
is watching cleaner wrasse do their work.

263
00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.457
They do an enormously important job.

264
00:20:08.624 --> 00:20:11.043
and that's pick the parasites
and dead skin

265
00:20:11.335 --> 00:20:12.628
and scales and everything else off.

266
00:20:13.003 --> 00:20:14.755
You know. they're getting
right inside their mouths

267
00:20:14.922 --> 00:20:18.467
and inside their gills.
They're constantly busy.

268
00:20:19.009 --> 00:20:21.804
They are just so fun to watch.

269
00:20:23.222 --> 00:20:24.849
And they. kind of.
do this funny little dance

270
00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:26.434
to try and bring in business.

271
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:31.397
Everyone comes to their cleaning stations.

272
00:20:32.264 --> 00:20:33.724
Cute little reef fish.

273
00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:36.736
And then you've got big predators.

274
00:20:37.903 --> 00:20:39.613
I tell you. it really takes
your breath away

275
00:20:39.947 --> 00:20:41.031
when you watch a cleaner wrasse

276
00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.409
going into the mouth
of a two-feet predator.

277
00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:46.120
There's just this convention
on the reef.

278
00:20:46.203 --> 00:20:50.708
they do not touch the cleaner wrasse.
It's one of those really lovely examples

279
00:20:50.958 --> 00:20:54.712
of how intricate
the relationships on a reef are.

280
00:20:58.841 --> 00:21:01.719
NARRATOR: While Doug continues
to explore the interconnections

281
00:21:01.886 --> 00:21:03.637
between the fish and the reef...

282
00:21:05.097 --> 00:21:08.267
back in the Red Sea.
Roger is about to find out

283
00:21:08.684 --> 00:21:11.312
that dolphins have similar dependencies.

284
00:21:13.981 --> 00:21:16.817
Angela has discovered
an incredible connection

285
00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:19.320
that dolphins have with the coral here.

286
00:21:19.663 --> 00:21:22.907
ROGER: I was really excited
about this one particular unique behavior

287
00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:24.617
that Angela had told me about.

288
00:21:24.859 --> 00:21:27.736
which I was really determined
to capture on film.

289
00:21:35.628 --> 00:21:38.547
NARRATOR: Angela has brought Roger
to a very special location

290
00:21:38.756 --> 00:21:40.883
that the dolphins
like to visit every day...

291
00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:45.429
and from which they reap great benefits.

292
00:21:46.388 --> 00:21:49.186
ROGER: The key focus for me
was that feeling. as a cameraman.

293
00:21:49.336 --> 00:21:53.395
knowing this is a unique piece of behavior
and is that wonderful pressure...

294
00:21:53.562 --> 00:21:55.356
-...to get it into the film.

295
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:04.865
NARRATOR: Angela's hard-earned
acceptance by the dolphins

296
00:22:05.241 --> 00:22:09.703
is what allowed her to follow them
and make this incredible discovery.

297
00:22:11.497 --> 00:22:13.415
ANGELA:
There is one certain kind of coral.

298
00:22:13.666 --> 00:22:15.417
It's called the gorgonian coral.

299
00:22:16.126 --> 00:22:22.466
And they really like to rub each body part
in this coral because it's quite soft.

300
00:22:29.682 --> 00:22:31.559
This rubbing behavior seems to be

301
00:22:31.767 --> 00:22:35.104
such an important aspect
in their daily life.

302
00:22:40.442 --> 00:22:43.445
ROGER: So. it's so wonderful
to see them. kind of. lining up.

303
00:22:44.488 --> 00:22:46.991
And they're very gentle.
They don't like fight to get through.

304
00:22:47.157 --> 00:22:50.578
And they're very courteous and allow
the one to go after the other.

305
00:22:51.537 --> 00:22:53.622
And then they circle back
and go through again.

306
00:23:00.713 --> 00:23:03.257
So. it's a wonderful
social ritual as well.

307
00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.014
ANGELA: What we also know
about different corals.

308
00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:12.266
they have antibacterial substances.

309
00:23:13.851 --> 00:23:17.646
So. it could also be
that the dolphins actually use also

310
00:23:17.813 --> 00:23:23.903
these corals for medicine. for example.
for even prevention for skin diseases.

311
00:23:26.322 --> 00:23:28.032
It's difficult to really prove it

312
00:23:28.282 --> 00:23:31.619
because it can be also
a very nice feeling.

313
00:23:32.411 --> 00:23:37.666
but we have to find out if it's a really
awareness of self-medication.

314
00:23:39.001 --> 00:23:41.337
NARRATOR:
Angela's groundbreaking observations

315
00:23:41.712 --> 00:23:43.464
have broaden our understanding.

316
00:23:43.881 --> 00:23:47.843
and also pose important new questions
about dolphin behavior.

317
00:23:49.762 --> 00:23:52.723
ROGER: The hypothesis
that Angela's exploring.

318
00:23:53.182 --> 00:23:55.351
and you know.
if this can be proven to be true.

319
00:23:55.726 --> 00:23:58.520
it just highlights the amazing
interdependence

320
00:23:58.687 --> 00:24:01.023
between these mammals
and the coral reefs.

321
00:24:02.566 --> 00:24:06.487
Not only do they come here
to rest and to play and to feel safe.

322
00:24:07.404 --> 00:24:10.366
but they're also actually coming
to heal themselves.

323
00:24:13.827 --> 00:24:17.206
NARRATOR: Angela hopes to reveal
more about these dolphins' lives

324
00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:20.501
so that we can protect them
and their reef home

325
00:24:20.751 --> 00:24:22.294
long into the future.

326
00:24:25.881 --> 00:24:30.344
But a coral reef doesn't always provide
a healthy sanctuary to its residents.

327
00:24:31.011 --> 00:24:33.180
as Doug is about to find out.

328
00:24:34.431 --> 00:24:38.102
DOUG: Obviously we have this vibrancy.
this color. this beauty.

329
00:24:38.268 --> 00:24:40.229
It's that. you know.
the light side of the reef.

330
00:24:40.496 --> 00:24:43.749
but the reef has its back alleys. too.

331
00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:46.694
It's got its dark places.

332
00:24:47.444 --> 00:24:48.862
Places where...

333
00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:54.493
you know. visually. things aren't just
all joy and beauty and vibrancy.

334
00:24:54.827 --> 00:24:57.955
but feel a little bit more
on the sinister side.

335
00:25:00.332 --> 00:25:04.461
NARRATOR: They are the places
that most divers dare not venture.

336
00:25:06.797 --> 00:25:08.549
Doug and his team are in Malaysia.

337
00:25:09.341 --> 00:25:10.676
on their way to Sipadan.

338
00:25:11.051 --> 00:25:15.097
an oceanic island
with a unique and hidden secret

339
00:25:15.514 --> 00:25:18.600
that reveals the dangers
some of our characters face

340
00:25:18.892 --> 00:25:20.561
right in their backyard.

341
00:25:21.478 --> 00:25:24.481
Sipadan is an extraordinary.
little island.

342
00:25:25.274 --> 00:25:28.986
It's a rock in the middle
of hundreds of meters of water.

343
00:25:29.653 --> 00:25:31.447
And it's a marine reserve.

344
00:25:31.613 --> 00:25:35.451
and there is just
an absolute heap of turtles here.

345
00:25:39.955 --> 00:25:42.541
NARRATOR: This reef would seem
like the perfect sanctuary.

346
00:25:44.293 --> 00:25:48.255
But beneath its tranquil shell
hides potential catastrophe

347
00:25:48.589 --> 00:25:50.257
for any wayward turtle.

348
00:25:52.468 --> 00:25:55.888
Inside the reef structure.
there's a catacomb.

349
00:25:56.263 --> 00:25:58.265
And that's what they are here to film.

350
00:25:59.043 --> 00:26:02.102
DOUG: I had heard of Turtle Cave
20 years previously.

351
00:26:02.478 --> 00:26:04.188
and how tricky it was to get in.

352
00:26:06.815 --> 00:26:09.443
...a small operation.
Just even getting the kit in there.

353
00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:12.529
before we even start thinking
of lighting it or doing the photography.

354
00:26:13.906 --> 00:26:15.574
We've got a jib.
which is like a big boom

355
00:26:15.741 --> 00:26:18.077
with a camera on one end
and weights on the other.

356
00:26:19.661 --> 00:26:21.330
We've got communications underwater.

357
00:26:21.622 --> 00:26:23.499
which mean that we can
talk to each other.

358
00:26:25.375 --> 00:26:26.960
We do have comms with the boat.

359
00:26:27.252 --> 00:26:30.172
um. but we lose that as soon
as we're through the cave entrance.

360
00:26:30.631 --> 00:26:32.633
Topside. topside. this is divers.

361
00:26:32.841 --> 00:26:34.760
We are just about to enter the cave.

362
00:26:34.968 --> 00:26:36.095
See you on the other side.

363
00:26:36.512 --> 00:26:38.597
HELEN: They could be down there
for a good three hours.

364
00:26:39.848 --> 00:26:41.183
If anything does go wrong.

365
00:26:41.391 --> 00:26:44.019
there's really nothing
that we can do from up here.

366
00:26:44.394 --> 00:26:46.105
All we can really do is wait.

367
00:26:47.848 --> 00:26:50.892
So. fingers crossed.
it all goes according to plan.

368
00:26:51.401 --> 00:26:52.986
Oh. divers

369
00:26:54.196 --> 00:26:57.032
Divers. divers. are you okay?

370
00:26:58.909 --> 00:27:00.619
We're at the cave

371
00:27:01.354 --> 00:27:04.679
Such a spooky place

372
00:27:04.957 --> 00:27:06.750
Very eerie

373
00:27:07.334 --> 00:27:08.961
Oh. divers...

374
00:27:10.921 --> 00:27:13.757
DOUG: We realize that this is going to be
a really tough place for us to work.

375
00:27:14.133 --> 00:27:15.425
We have to lay lines

376
00:27:15.717 --> 00:27:18.262
so that we could feel our way
in and out of the cave.

377
00:27:19.263 --> 00:27:21.807
There's no light in there.
It's a small passage.

378
00:27:22.099 --> 00:27:24.017
We only illuminate it with a flashlight.

379
00:27:25.511 --> 00:27:28.722
Okay now. so. you're getting glimpses
of just how remote

380
00:27:29.164 --> 00:27:31.166
and how difficult to get into.
and therefore.

381
00:27:31.433 --> 00:27:33.348
difficult to get out of this space was.

382
00:27:35.445 --> 00:27:37.781
I never felt completely at ease.

383
00:27:46.123 --> 00:27:48.709
DOUG: Usually. you know.
when you're diving open ocean.

384
00:27:49.001 --> 00:27:52.087
you get a problem. you run out of gas.
you got an equipment problem.

385
00:27:52.462 --> 00:27:55.340
you just go up. And in a cave.
you can't do that.

386
00:27:55.507 --> 00:27:58.844
You know. there's only out.

387
00:28:01.305 --> 00:28:03.765
And then. obviously. the other big thing
is it's dark in there. you know.

388
00:28:03.891 --> 00:28:06.643
from an equipment point of view.
so we're going to have to light it.

389
00:28:07.144 --> 00:28:10.689
Most of the thought went into how
we were going to logistically do it

390
00:28:10.856 --> 00:28:13.650
rather than the actual visuals
of what it was going to look like.

391
00:28:13.984 --> 00:28:17.154
Then it really wasn't until I turned
the lights on in the cave

392
00:28:17.321 --> 00:28:19.364
that I really got a sense
of what sort of place it was.

393
00:28:20.949 --> 00:28:23.243
What I saw was a tomb.

394
00:28:24.036 --> 00:28:25.954
And on the ledges of these caverns

395
00:28:26.371 --> 00:28:28.957
lay the almost perfect skeletons
of green turtles

396
00:28:29.249 --> 00:28:31.251
that had. over the years. died there.

397
00:28:40.469 --> 00:28:42.804
This turtle behind you

398
00:28:44.681 --> 00:28:47.976
Wondering what you are doing

399
00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:50.562
Filming in the cave

400
00:28:51.772 --> 00:28:54.233
He wants to come with you

401
00:28:54.983 --> 00:28:58.195
With you. come with you...

402
00:28:58.654 --> 00:29:01.615
NARRATOR: Doug must move
very slowly and carefully.

403
00:29:02.366 --> 00:29:05.077
The cave floor is covered
in fine sediment.

404
00:29:09.748 --> 00:29:12.334
Some believe this to be
the powdered remains

405
00:29:12.834 --> 00:29:18.423
of thousands of turtle skeletons
that have crumbled over countless ages.

406
00:29:18.966 --> 00:29:22.386
And one false move
could cloud the entire cave.

407
00:29:22.636 --> 00:29:25.973
making it difficult for the crew
to find their way out.

408
00:29:31.979 --> 00:29:34.314
After hours of meticulous setup.

409
00:29:35.274 --> 00:29:38.193
Doug starts to reveal
the cave's haunting secrets

410
00:29:38.443 --> 00:29:42.990
from the perspective of a turtle
who has tragically lost its way.

411
00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:52.541
DOUG: It felt like being in a church.

412
00:29:53.583 --> 00:29:55.419
I felt enormous respect for the place.

413
00:29:56.295 --> 00:29:58.880
There was a sense of peace and reverence.

414
00:30:00.215 --> 00:30:03.802
An eerie connection to something.

415
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:06.680
We all felt it.

416
00:30:07.806 --> 00:30:10.809
A coral reef. in many ways.
is a giver of life...

417
00:30:11.893 --> 00:30:13.186
but it also takes.

418
00:30:15.814 --> 00:30:19.192
NARRATOR: Hours later.
they make their way back to the surface

419
00:30:19.693 --> 00:30:23.030
-and to the safety of the boat.
-

420
00:30:25.824 --> 00:30:27.826
For you...

421
00:30:40.147 --> 00:30:43.108
That was so much more special
than I thought it would be.

422
00:30:43.467 --> 00:30:47.054
It was really quite touching
to see all these turtle skeletons

423
00:30:47.262 --> 00:30:49.514
in the bottom of the cave.
and then. you know.

424
00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:52.768
just imagining the turtles
when they got lost in there

425
00:30:52.851 --> 00:30:55.062
and how scared and afraid
they must've been.

426
00:30:59.232 --> 00:31:02.027
NARRATOR: To convey the broader story
of this undersea world.

427
00:31:02.402 --> 00:31:05.489
the filmmakers wanted to balance
these harsh realities

428
00:31:06.198 --> 00:31:08.533
with scenes of beauty and enchantment.

429
00:31:09.618 --> 00:31:10.911
And back in Hawaii.

430
00:31:11.328 --> 00:31:14.915
Didier has found
the greatest enchantment of all.

431
00:31:17.167 --> 00:31:19.544
A singing male humpback whale

432
00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:24.174
with hundreds of others
from miles around joining the chorus.

433
00:31:27.886 --> 00:31:30.931
NARRATOR: Just 50 years ago.
these waters were quiet.

434
00:31:33.225 --> 00:31:37.104
Scientist. Joe Mobley. has been monitoring
their population recovery.

435
00:31:39.523 --> 00:31:42.776
JOE: Humpback whales in North Pacific
were hunted to near extinction

436
00:31:42.968 --> 00:31:45.220
until they were protected in 1966.

437
00:31:45.695 --> 00:31:47.739
At that time. there were probably
under a thousand whales

438
00:31:47.948 --> 00:31:48.949
that came to Hawaii.

439
00:31:49.574 --> 00:31:51.576
But now. 50 years later.

440
00:31:51.993 --> 00:31:56.123
there are maybe as many as 10.000 animals
that visit the Hawaiian Islands.

441
00:31:57.749 --> 00:32:01.294
So. this day on the Luckey Strike.
we were looking for a singer.

442
00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:04.423
To show that the whales
communicate together.

443
00:32:04.589 --> 00:32:06.174
it's part of a community.

444
00:32:06.425 --> 00:32:10.720
NARRATOR: But nothing prepared Didier
for what he was about to encounter.

445
00:32:10.846 --> 00:32:12.514
...hundred feet down
and we can see the back fins.

446
00:32:12.764 --> 00:32:14.599
There are a lot of mackerel showing here.
which is...

447
00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.811
That's a whale right here.
this red mark right here.

448
00:32:18.562 --> 00:32:21.022
-It's down a hundred feet.
-He's right there.

449
00:32:21.231 --> 00:32:24.067
-He was singing away...
-DIDIER: I heard it. too.

450
00:32:24.234 --> 00:32:25.652
Well. the girls said they could hear him

451
00:32:25.777 --> 00:32:27.863
-clear as could be on the bow.
-DIDIER: Yeah.

452
00:32:29.781 --> 00:32:33.118
DIDIER: Being on the boat.
we can hear the male singing so strong

453
00:32:33.285 --> 00:32:35.162
when you are right above the singer.

454
00:32:37.581 --> 00:32:39.416
-We can still hear him.
-DIDIER: Yeah. yeah. yeah.

455
00:32:39.708 --> 00:32:40.876
So. we're very close.

456
00:32:42.377 --> 00:32:44.921
DIDIER:
So. gently. we went down into the water.

457
00:32:54.806 --> 00:32:58.268
DIDIER:
Today I looked down. then two whales came.

458
00:32:58.602 --> 00:33:02.314
and they start to move
and to stop in front of me.

459
00:33:02.898 --> 00:33:04.232
Right in front of me.

460
00:33:16.161 --> 00:33:20.332
NARRATOR: Then. an unimaginable event
began to unfold

461
00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:21.917
before Didier's eyes.

462
00:33:26.922 --> 00:33:31.635
DIDIER: Then. a third whale came.
and they start to dance together.

463
00:34:20.392 --> 00:34:27.357
It's really a gift from nature
to be first row in the theater.

464
00:34:33.613 --> 00:34:35.198
Diving with those giants.

465
00:34:35.865 --> 00:34:38.994
you finally realize how small you are.

466
00:34:51.172 --> 00:34:54.797
That was one of the best moments
of my life.

467
00:34:55.051 --> 00:34:56.761
That was just magnificent.

468
00:35:08.441 --> 00:35:10.191
You can't forget any of those moments

469
00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:13.987
when you are alone. very small
next to those giants. you know.

470
00:35:14.195 --> 00:35:16.740
So. it is really something like it is...

471
00:35:17.073 --> 00:35:19.284
I will keep in my memory forever.

472
00:35:21.202 --> 00:35:25.040
NARRATOR: What Didier has managed
to capture is just a tiny glimpse

473
00:35:25.457 --> 00:35:28.627
into the humpback's complex.
social behavior.

474
00:35:29.878 --> 00:35:32.797
But we are yet to understand
the true meaning

475
00:35:32.964 --> 00:35:35.216
of this magnificent whale ballet.

476
00:35:40.597 --> 00:35:45.018
Dolphins take their social activities
to a whole new level.

477
00:35:47.187 --> 00:35:50.982
And the team wanted to show
exactly how they get their thrills.

478
00:35:52.317 --> 00:35:53.985
ROGER:
They're a symbol of freedom. you know.

479
00:35:54.194 --> 00:35:56.446
They roam the oceans.
They're not constrained.

480
00:35:56.704 --> 00:36:02.243
And you really see that perhaps.
most beautifully expressed when they surf.

481
00:36:04.079 --> 00:36:06.247
NARRATOR:
Surfing dolphins are a regular sight

482
00:36:06.456 --> 00:36:09.751
on the Wild Coast of South Africa.
where Roger grew up.

483
00:36:11.211 --> 00:36:16.091
Now. he's returning to his roots
with a team of big wave specialists

484
00:36:16.591 --> 00:36:19.552
to try and film
this amazing dolphin behavior.

485
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:25.684
ROGER: The reason we chose the Wild Coast
is that we know it's got dolphins.

486
00:36:25.892 --> 00:36:28.353
We know that in the winter.
when the winter swells come through.

487
00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:29.979
it's got these incredible swells.

488
00:36:31.481 --> 00:36:34.192
NARRATOR: And Roger's goal
is to film them by getting

489
00:36:34.526 --> 00:36:36.945
right inside the surf zone.

490
00:36:39.114 --> 00:36:41.324
Fellow cinematographer. Jamie McPherson.

491
00:36:41.574 --> 00:36:45.995
has attached a gyro-stabilized camera
on the back of a high-speed boat.

492
00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:51.251
while skipper. Carl. negotiates the boat
behind the breaking waves.

493
00:36:53.002 --> 00:36:55.797
Pro surf veteran. Paris.
will use a jet ski

494
00:36:55.964 --> 00:36:59.134
to place Roger
right in front of the break.

495
00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:02.220
The stage is set.

496
00:37:02.804 --> 00:37:05.473
and the dolphins have turned up
as if on cue.

497
00:37:05.849 --> 00:37:08.101
traveling up the coastline
in large groups.

498
00:37:09.644 --> 00:37:12.981
But the crew have just met
their first hurdle.

499
00:37:13.565 --> 00:37:19.529
Ironically. the infamous Wild Coast
has turned completely calm.

500
00:37:21.573 --> 00:37:25.034
We've passed literally. I would say.
two to three hundred dolphins.

501
00:37:25.301 --> 00:37:28.304
maybe. you know. in about
six or seven different pods.

502
00:37:28.538 --> 00:37:32.584
So. the dolphins are here.
but absolutely no swell.

503
00:37:33.042 --> 00:37:35.253
It's good that we got dolphins.
we just need a decent wave.

504
00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:37.430
At the moment we got no decent wave. so...

505
00:37:38.631 --> 00:37:41.176
Hopefully in the next two days.
we're supposed to get some better swells.

506
00:37:41.342 --> 00:37:44.679
So. it's just a case of waiting
and hoping that the swell picks up

507
00:37:44.846 --> 00:37:48.057
and that dolphins actually fancy
having a surf.

508
00:37:52.687 --> 00:37:56.733
But what we did get
was this incredibly clean patch of water.

509
00:37:56.941 --> 00:37:59.277
which in the Transkei
is very. very unusual.

510
00:38:00.195 --> 00:38:01.529
So. we took this opportunity

511
00:38:01.696 --> 00:38:04.866
to try and get some underwater shots
of these dolphins coming through.

512
00:38:05.563 --> 00:38:09.120
Holding fingers. fins.
crossing rostrums and blowholes

513
00:38:09.329 --> 00:38:10.830
and flukes and flippers
and hands and feet.

514
00:38:11.122 --> 00:38:12.916
Everything we can cross. we're crossing.

515
00:38:14.626 --> 00:38:16.753
NARRATOR:
Roger dives into the clear shallows

516
00:38:16.961 --> 00:38:18.046
of the beach break.

517
00:38:21.382 --> 00:38:25.094
And soon. an enthusiastic
dolphin pod approaches.

518
00:38:26.721 --> 00:38:29.224
ROGER: When I got in the water
with the dolphins for the first time.

519
00:38:29.682 --> 00:38:32.685
there's this kind of strange jostling
back flexing behavior.

520
00:38:32.852 --> 00:38:36.773
Now. whether that was some social.
you know. interaction. I'm not sure.

521
00:38:37.106 --> 00:38:39.526
And I've never seen this before
anywhere else in the world.

522
00:38:43.655 --> 00:38:46.908
NARRATOR: As luck would have it.
with Roger now in amongst the pod.

523
00:38:47.909 --> 00:38:50.036
a set of waves finally comes in.

524
00:38:51.454 --> 00:38:54.040
And our lead actors are in business.

525
00:38:56.292 --> 00:38:58.545
ROGER:
The speed that came through was amazing.

526
00:38:59.546 --> 00:39:03.341
You actually see the way
they are using the energy of the wave

527
00:39:03.508 --> 00:39:05.927
to gain the momentum.
They're riding the pressure wave.

528
00:39:06.302 --> 00:39:08.596
And then you see them turn.
sort of build up speed.

529
00:39:08.763 --> 00:39:10.306
and then they bank left.

530
00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.059
And it's that pressure that shoots them
out the back of the wave.

531
00:39:13.351 --> 00:39:16.229
And it was just marvelous
to be in amongst all of that.

532
00:39:16.521 --> 00:39:18.606
It was just such a bonus.

533
00:39:20.774 --> 00:39:21.942
NARRATOR: But soon.

534
00:39:22.076 --> 00:39:24.454
the swell begins
to get dangerous for Roger.

535
00:39:24.737 --> 00:39:25.905
Time to get out.

536
00:39:28.575 --> 00:39:30.368
At last. surf is up.

537
00:39:30.869 --> 00:39:33.246
And with it. more dolphins.

538
00:39:33.663 --> 00:39:35.248
Hello. do you read me?

539
00:39:35.373 --> 00:39:38.293
There's quite a lot of dolphins
that are moving for the surf zone.

540
00:39:38.668 --> 00:39:41.838
So. yeah. looking very strong.
I think we're going to get something.

541
00:39:42.338 --> 00:39:43.423
Come on down.

542
00:39:45.466 --> 00:39:49.137
NARRATOR: Finally.
it's action stations for Jamie's team.

543
00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:54.642
JAMIE: Dolphins in the wave.

544
00:39:55.268 --> 00:39:58.646
NARRATOR: Carl must maneuver his boat
skillfully inside the surf zone...

545
00:40:00.106 --> 00:40:02.567
and get Jamie into the best
possible position.

546
00:40:04.652 --> 00:40:06.321
JAIMIE: You have to outrun the wave.

547
00:40:06.821 --> 00:40:08.948
But then. at certain point.
you have to get out. which means

548
00:40:09.157 --> 00:40:10.742
going over the top
of the 15-foot wave.

549
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:12.535
so there's a 15-foot drop
in the back of it.

550
00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:15.914
NARRATOR: As they battle the waves.
Carl must also guide Jamie to where

551
00:40:16.214 --> 00:40:17.840
the dolphins might leap out.

552
00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:19.784
Watch out. There they go.

553
00:40:22.003 --> 00:40:23.922
CARL:
Yeah. So. we got in the face of that wave.

554
00:40:26.466 --> 00:40:28.092
JAMIE: Technically. it's very tricky to be

555
00:40:28.217 --> 00:40:30.053
tight on a dolphin
that's swimming through a wave whilst

556
00:40:30.403 --> 00:40:32.867
you're driving the other way
at high speed.

557
00:40:35.725 --> 00:40:37.727
NARRATOR:
But it finally starts to pay off

558
00:40:38.292 --> 00:40:42.106
as Jamie captures wave after wave
of dolphin magic.

559
00:40:51.574 --> 00:40:53.576
JAMIE: It's the most exciting.
dynamic thing that I've done.

560
00:41:03.836 --> 00:41:07.048
NARRATOR: But Carl mustn't get caught
too far in front of the waves.

561
00:41:07.966 --> 00:41:11.302
If they begin to crest.
they can easily flip his boat.

562
00:41:12.637 --> 00:41:14.722
This is where Roger and Paris come in.

563
00:41:15.798 --> 00:41:18.092
-Time to deploy the jet ski.
-Yeah. Let's go.

564
00:41:18.351 --> 00:41:20.228
ROGER: It was the first time
that I've ever attempted

565
00:41:20.395 --> 00:41:22.063
to film dolphins from a jet ski.

566
00:41:22.438 --> 00:41:24.315
But what we hoped for was just to get

567
00:41:24.399 --> 00:41:26.901
one or two unique shots
in front of the wave.

568
00:41:27.193 --> 00:41:30.738
Those waves were big. you know.
It's a big wave.

569
00:41:31.698 --> 00:41:33.908
You've got a really skilled pilot
trying to get you

570
00:41:34.075 --> 00:41:35.702
into these really difficult situations

571
00:41:35.868 --> 00:41:38.538
where that wave could just swamp you
at any time.

572
00:41:39.288 --> 00:41:40.581
Paris was just astounding.

573
00:41:40.832 --> 00:41:44.419
He was able to just anticipate
how the wave was going to break.

574
00:41:45.294 --> 00:41:46.671
I'll never forget that moment where

575
00:41:46.888 --> 00:41:49.098
there was a really nice break
coming through.

576
00:41:49.465 --> 00:41:51.050
really good-sized pod of dolphins.

577
00:41:52.552 --> 00:41:54.303
We really had a go at one wave...

578
00:41:56.305 --> 00:41:59.600
and then I just remember seeing dolphins
in the face of the wave.

579
00:42:01.476 --> 00:42:04.396
Paris has got to wait. wait. wait.
He's got to judge it.

580
00:42:06.088 --> 00:42:09.694
Just this. you know. wonderful image
of them all racing down the wave.

581
00:42:09.861 --> 00:42:12.989
And then. as that wave breaks.
he's going to accelerate us out of there.

582
00:42:13.448 --> 00:42:14.824
And it happened so quickly.

583
00:42:21.664 --> 00:42:24.000
ROGER: It was really the shot
that I was so hoping to get.

584
00:42:28.796 --> 00:42:31.174
This is so exhilarating.
You've been waiting for so long. you know.

585
00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:33.593
you're sitting.
you're waiting for. like. days and days.

586
00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:36.137
And then suddenly. you know.
the set's here and everything's right.

587
00:42:36.345 --> 00:42:38.264
And in the next minute. you know.
Stevie just picks up.

588
00:42:38.431 --> 00:42:40.475
he goes. "Pick up the things."
and. bang. you know. on it.

589
00:42:40.641 --> 00:42:42.894
exactly as we predicted.
just jumping down the face.

590
00:42:43.352 --> 00:42:45.146
surfing the wave together.
jumping out the back.

591
00:42:45.646 --> 00:42:47.523
ROGER: I mean. it's fantastic. yeah.

592
00:42:49.067 --> 00:42:52.779
NARRATOR: Our filmmakers have captured
some incredible. dynamic scenes

593
00:42:53.045 --> 00:42:54.839
of dolphins letting loose.

594
00:42:56.866 --> 00:42:59.952
But a dolphin's daily life
is not all fun and games.

595
00:43:02.914 --> 00:43:04.499
They also need to find food.

596
00:43:05.291 --> 00:43:07.251
not often found on the reef itself.

597
00:43:12.465 --> 00:43:15.343
And one of the most amazing
dolphin feeding grounds

598
00:43:15.968 --> 00:43:17.178
is in the Bahamas.

599
00:43:18.805 --> 00:43:20.389
Onboard the Dolphin Dream.

600
00:43:20.657 --> 00:43:24.060
our Bahamian team are relying
on skipper Scott Smith.

601
00:43:24.477 --> 00:43:27.980
a veteran dolphin finder.
to take them to the action.

602
00:43:30.817 --> 00:43:32.944
Joining the crew
for this portion of the story

603
00:43:33.469 --> 00:43:35.346
is cinematographer Paul Atkins

604
00:43:35.905 --> 00:43:40.576
a marine biologist and dolphin specialist
who's filmed them all over the world.

605
00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:53.840
PAUL: I've been filming dolphins
and whales for over 30 years.

606
00:43:54.924 --> 00:43:57.510
So. I've filmed bottlenose dolphins
in the Bahamas before.

607
00:43:58.302 --> 00:44:01.139
I always look for an opportunity
to go back.

608
00:44:02.306 --> 00:44:04.892
It's just always a thrill
to get in the water

609
00:44:05.353 --> 00:44:07.353
and to see animals that I'm familiar with.

610
00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:12.024
And sometimes.
I feel like they remember me.

611
00:44:12.275 --> 00:44:14.443
that they're coming up to me
and saying hello.

612
00:44:15.695 --> 00:44:18.072
Eventually. when they stop paying
attention to you.

613
00:44:18.239 --> 00:44:20.408
and then you become a part of their tribe.

614
00:44:20.575 --> 00:44:23.870
And it's an extraordinary experience
when you can just travel with them

615
00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:26.080
and see what they do.

616
00:44:28.457 --> 00:44:32.587
NARRATOR: Paul is here to capture
dolphins hunting in a very special way.

617
00:44:35.673 --> 00:44:38.718
They use a type of sonar
called echolocation.

618
00:44:39.635 --> 00:44:41.804
which works kind of like x-ray vision.

619
00:44:47.685 --> 00:44:52.106
They emit a series of rapid-fire clicks
that bounce off hidden objects.

620
00:44:53.107 --> 00:44:55.735
allowing them to locate food
beneath the sand...

621
00:44:59.363 --> 00:45:01.490
food like razorfish.

622
00:45:06.787 --> 00:45:09.415
PAUL:
When you're with a group of dolphins.

623
00:45:09.749 --> 00:45:13.169
you feel privileged
to be witnessing their culture.

624
00:45:15.671 --> 00:45:20.509
Dolphins are one of the few animals
besides humans and great apes

625
00:45:20.801 --> 00:45:23.095
that actually have been shown
to have culture.

626
00:45:23.526 --> 00:45:26.641
And that culture is based
on ways of finding food.

627
00:45:37.485 --> 00:45:38.527
NARRATOR: Around the world.

628
00:45:38.945 --> 00:45:41.739
dolphins have developed
different feeding strategies

629
00:45:42.156 --> 00:45:43.741
depending on their habitat.

630
00:45:45.201 --> 00:45:49.163
And some of them involve
extraordinary levels of teamwork.

631
00:45:53.584 --> 00:45:56.212
These shallow tidal mudflats in Florida

632
00:45:56.472 --> 00:46:00.322
are a rich feeding ground
for many marine and coastal animals.

633
00:46:02.009 --> 00:46:04.053
And with its great abundance of fish.

634
00:46:04.303 --> 00:46:09.100
it has given rise to a unique
and spectacular dolphin hunting technique

635
00:46:09.809 --> 00:46:11.644
known as mud ringing.

636
00:46:17.525 --> 00:46:19.193
Scientist. Laura Engleby.

637
00:46:19.652 --> 00:46:23.781
has brought cinematographer
Jamie McPherson onto these tidal flats

638
00:46:24.031 --> 00:46:26.617
in search of this remarkable phenomenon.

639
00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:32.290
For Jamie. it may not be as heart-stopping

640
00:46:32.456 --> 00:46:34.792
as filming dolphins surfing the big waves.

641
00:46:35.501 --> 00:46:37.086
but it is just as difficult.

642
00:46:41.716 --> 00:46:44.010
-JAMIE: Oh. damn it.
-

643
00:46:44.337 --> 00:46:46.887
JAMIE: From the boat. it's tricky because
you have to work out where they are.

644
00:46:47.346 --> 00:46:48.931
The camera's right on sea level.

645
00:46:49.482 --> 00:46:51.067
You only see them when they surface.

646
00:46:51.267 --> 00:46:52.476
So. you see the fins occasionally.

647
00:46:52.727 --> 00:46:54.603
You're trying to work out
where they're going to go.

648
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:56.247
It's very hard to coordinate that.

649
00:46:56.856 --> 00:46:59.275
It's very tricky to be in the right place
at the right time.

650
00:47:02.361 --> 00:47:05.239
NARRATOR: Suddenly. the dolphins
look like they are teaming up

651
00:47:05.614 --> 00:47:07.033
and coordinating their efforts.

652
00:47:07.455 --> 00:47:08.605
WOMAN:
No. Jamie. now they're to the right.

653
00:47:08.951 --> 00:47:10.619
-To the right.
-JAMIE: Coming where?

654
00:47:10.703 --> 00:47:12.079
-WOMAN 1: To your right.
-WOMAN 2: Right.

655
00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:14.105
WOMAN 1: See them?

656
00:47:15.458 --> 00:47:16.917
NARRATOR: They've started to hunt.

657
00:47:21.063 --> 00:47:24.108
Jamie zeroes in on the action
with his zoom lens.

658
00:47:29.764 --> 00:47:31.223
JAMIE: Well. you see a lot of splashing.

659
00:47:33.601 --> 00:47:36.687
They don't put their heads up to catch
the fish until the very last second.

660
00:47:37.396 --> 00:47:40.232
The dolphins still have to try and catch
fish that's flying through the air.

661
00:47:40.566 --> 00:47:42.735
So. to see the look on their faces
and see how quick they are

662
00:47:42.818 --> 00:47:45.863
at reacting to the fish that are flying
really immerses you in it.

663
00:47:47.031 --> 00:47:49.158
But to understand the behavior
and really see what was going on.

664
00:47:49.825 --> 00:47:51.202
we had to get in the air.

665
00:48:02.972 --> 00:48:06.183
NARRATOR: Spotting dolphin pods
across these vast mudflats

666
00:48:06.475 --> 00:48:08.853
is much easier in a helicopter.

667
00:48:10.137 --> 00:48:11.639
I see some dolphins right down here.

668
00:48:11.847 --> 00:48:15.059
NARRATOR: Each day.
dolphins travel up these tidal channels

669
00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:17.269
into dangerously shallow waters.

670
00:48:18.229 --> 00:48:21.399
lured here by the sheer bounty
of fish to be had.

671
00:48:23.042 --> 00:48:24.919
It looks like they're in
really shallow water there.

672
00:48:27.029 --> 00:48:29.031
NARRATOR:
It's so shallow here at low tide.

673
00:48:29.323 --> 00:48:31.242
they often have to swim on their sides.

674
00:48:36.789 --> 00:48:40.626
This one certainly seems
to be having fun hunting in the sea grass.

675
00:48:41.085 --> 00:48:43.587
What are you doing?

676
00:48:48.384 --> 00:48:50.219
NARRATOR:
But this is not the hunting behavior

677
00:48:50.302 --> 00:48:51.512
the crew are looking for.

678
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:54.014
So. they continue their search.

679
00:48:54.498 --> 00:48:56.225
-PILOT: Yeah. I'm bringing it around.
-LAURA: All right.

680
00:48:56.308 --> 00:48:57.685
-PILOT: Yeah. preparing...
-LAURA: Yeah...

681
00:48:57.768 --> 00:48:59.073
PILOT: ...turning the nose right now...

682
00:48:59.186 --> 00:49:00.479
JAMIE: Yeah. I will. So. we'll just

683
00:49:00.604 --> 00:49:02.523
come back to these guys
if we can't find anything else.

684
00:49:03.149 --> 00:49:04.150
NARRATOR: Nearby.

685
00:49:04.316 --> 00:49:06.944
another group of dolphins
reveal some of the risks

686
00:49:07.153 --> 00:49:09.196
of hunting in such shallow waters.

687
00:49:10.281 --> 00:49:13.242
-LAURA: Oh. they're definitely stranded.
-JAMIE: Yeah. they're definitely stranded.

688
00:49:14.535 --> 00:49:16.787
LAURA: Quite amazing. They made
a little mud hole for themselves.

689
00:49:17.872 --> 00:49:21.959
They have come around in tight circles
and have created a mud hole

690
00:49:22.209 --> 00:49:23.752
to where they can at least swim

691
00:49:24.003 --> 00:49:26.755
and not get sun burns
and not flip on their sides

692
00:49:26.881 --> 00:49:28.924
because the worse thing.
when they're stuck like that.

693
00:49:29.091 --> 00:49:32.511
is they can crush their internal organs
with their own body weight and overheat.

694
00:49:33.554 --> 00:49:35.890
JAMIE: It's horrible to see
'cause you can see they're stressed out.

695
00:49:36.015 --> 00:49:38.066
you can see they're worried.
and there's nothing you can do.

696
00:49:38.241 --> 00:49:40.352
You're in a helicopter flying around
and no one can help them.

697
00:49:43.564 --> 00:49:45.441
NARRATOR:
Laura knows the tide is rising.

698
00:49:45.691 --> 00:49:47.693
so the dolphins will soon be freed.

699
00:49:49.778 --> 00:49:52.281
And before long. they spot something.

700
00:49:53.032 --> 00:49:54.158
Mud clouds.

701
00:49:57.077 --> 00:50:00.623
As they approach. they can see
the dolphins are definitely hunting.

702
00:50:01.582 --> 00:50:04.335
LAURA: From the air.
it offers a whole different perspective

703
00:50:04.502 --> 00:50:05.753
of what's going on.

704
00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:09.757
They're clearly chasing some prey.
but this is a feeding strategy

705
00:50:09.924 --> 00:50:11.675
that hasn't been documented
in the literature

706
00:50:11.842 --> 00:50:13.969
that we're just now.
through this aerial footage.

707
00:50:14.136 --> 00:50:16.472
able to really see what they're doing.

708
00:50:17.848 --> 00:50:20.017
NARRATOR:
But this still isn't the hunting behavior

709
00:50:20.184 --> 00:50:21.435
they've come here to film.

710
00:50:24.563 --> 00:50:26.106
Then. finally.

711
00:50:26.689 --> 00:50:28.775
Jamie spots what they've been looking for.

712
00:50:29.443 --> 00:50:34.406
This dolphin beats up the mud
with its fluke. creating a perfect circle.

713
00:50:36.158 --> 00:50:37.326
A mud ring.

714
00:50:38.118 --> 00:50:40.037
Aww. Wow. Aww.

715
00:50:40.287 --> 00:50:41.956
NARRATOR: This technique in itself...

716
00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:45.000
showcases
the dolphin's remarkable intelligence

717
00:50:45.751 --> 00:50:50.172
as they use the muddy substrate
to form the perfect fishing net.

718
00:50:53.383 --> 00:50:55.760
I see they've got
a shoal of fish surrounded.

719
00:50:56.053 --> 00:50:57.555
Yeah. it's really nice.

720
00:50:58.055 --> 00:51:01.183
NARRATOR: Other dolphins have
corralled the shoal of fish into the ring.

721
00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:04.895
And the entrapped fish.
in trying to escape.

722
00:51:05.145 --> 00:51:07.439
leap straight into their waiting mouths.

723
00:51:21.245 --> 00:51:23.664
Absolutely perfect.
there's a whole shoal of fish.

724
00:51:24.415 --> 00:51:26.417
You can see the dolphins
trying to get around them.

725
00:51:29.461 --> 00:51:31.589
-Look at that. there.
-

726
00:51:31.922 --> 00:51:34.091
-LAURA: That is amazing.
-JAMIE: That's pretty amazing.

727
00:51:39.471 --> 00:51:41.890
JAMIE: I've never seen anything
that coordinated.

728
00:51:42.516 --> 00:51:44.643
And they're definitely working together
and communicating

729
00:51:45.019 --> 00:51:46.729
to better coordinate the ring

730
00:51:46.937 --> 00:51:48.939
and make the fish leap
and land where dolphins are waiting.

731
00:51:49.106 --> 00:51:51.692
-It's. yeah. an amazing display.
-

732
00:52:17.635 --> 00:52:19.511
NARRATOR:
The team's patience has paid off.

733
00:52:20.621 --> 00:52:22.623
They've finally captured on film

734
00:52:23.057 --> 00:52:27.186
this remarkable cooperative
hunting strategy of bottlenose dolphins.

735
00:52:32.232 --> 00:52:34.818
In much deeper waters
off the coast of Hawaii.

736
00:52:35.944 --> 00:52:37.946
our whale team have returned to film

737
00:52:38.113 --> 00:52:40.491
a great gathering of male humpbacks.

738
00:52:43.077 --> 00:52:44.078
But this gathering

739
00:52:44.244 --> 00:52:47.289
is not in the same cooperative spirit
as the dolphins.

740
00:52:48.499 --> 00:52:49.667
Quite the opposite.

741
00:52:51.043 --> 00:52:53.462
An intense competition is brewing.

742
00:52:55.381 --> 00:52:57.758
Here. they gather in the greatest numbers

743
00:52:58.008 --> 00:53:01.804
to take part
in the most spectacular battle in nature.

744
00:53:11.095 --> 00:53:13.440
Back on the Luckey Strike.
Tad has now teamed up

745
00:53:13.731 --> 00:53:16.234
with Paul Atkins
to film this great ritual.

746
00:53:17.194 --> 00:53:21.907
They are following a female humpback
who has a number of males in hot pursuit.

747
00:53:23.492 --> 00:53:26.620
PAUL: There's definitely an air
of excitement and tension when you're

748
00:53:26.787 --> 00:53:28.956
headed out to film one of these battles.

749
00:53:29.206 --> 00:53:31.125
You're never quite sure
what's going to happen.

750
00:53:32.126 --> 00:53:34.795
They're going really fast
at eleven o'clock.

751
00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:43.303
NARRATOR: Professor Joe Mobley
is documenting the activity from the bow.

752
00:53:46.223 --> 00:53:50.436
And as the boat catches up with the pod.
things really start to heat up.

753
00:53:53.021 --> 00:53:55.399
The battle is about to commence.

754
00:54:02.114 --> 00:54:04.074
The males begin to chase one another.

755
00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:16.545
It's a pretty fast-moving pod.

756
00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:26.805
As Paul begin to film
some spectacular surface behavior.

757
00:54:27.389 --> 00:54:29.975
more and more whales join the competition.

758
00:54:33.395 --> 00:54:36.106
All these challengers
are racing to catch up

759
00:54:36.315 --> 00:54:38.484
and displace the current front-runner.

760
00:54:39.276 --> 00:54:42.738
wanting to become the ultimate champion.

761
00:54:52.289 --> 00:54:55.417
Out in front.
the female is setting the pace.

762
00:54:59.797 --> 00:55:02.966
But this surface view does not reveal
the whole combat.

763
00:55:03.467 --> 00:55:05.844
as Joe has speculated for many years.

764
00:55:06.887 --> 00:55:10.307
JOE: The frustrating thing is I'm bound
to the above-surface world.

765
00:55:10.682 --> 00:55:12.643
where we're limited to probably
less than ten percent

766
00:55:12.810 --> 00:55:13.894
of their total behavior.

767
00:55:14.186 --> 00:55:16.396
You know. most of what's important
is going down below.

768
00:55:19.691 --> 00:55:21.068
Looks good for pole cam. right?

769
00:55:21.310 --> 00:55:22.311
Go ahead.

770
00:55:22.611 --> 00:55:24.071
We're going to give it a try.

771
00:55:25.447 --> 00:55:27.783
JOE: So. increasingly. I've been
relying on opportunities like this

772
00:55:27.991 --> 00:55:31.253
to work with film crews
with their high-tech equipment.

773
00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:33.205
And those kinds of instruments
basically give us

774
00:55:33.372 --> 00:55:35.582
a whale's eye view.
It puts us in their world.

775
00:55:35.874 --> 00:55:37.835
Much more likely to answer
the kinds of questions

776
00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:40.254
that we've been asking for decades now.

777
00:55:41.813 --> 00:55:42.940
TAD: Okay. you've got it?

778
00:55:43.131 --> 00:55:45.884
PAUL: So. we designed the granddaddy
of all pole cams.

779
00:55:46.218 --> 00:55:47.803
and this had never been tried before.

780
00:55:48.428 --> 00:55:49.471
MAN: Okay. I got it.

781
00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:53.308
PAUL: And the pole cam system
has to be beefy and sturdy enough

782
00:55:53.559 --> 00:55:57.145
to withstand moving through water
at four to five knots.

783
00:55:57.437 --> 00:55:58.939
sometimes six knots.

784
00:56:01.316 --> 00:56:04.319
NARRATOR: Paul hopes to capture
a unique underwater perspective

785
00:56:04.486 --> 00:56:06.196
of this great contest.

786
00:56:08.448 --> 00:56:11.118
On top deck.
he prepares the viewing monitor.

787
00:56:12.786 --> 00:56:15.622
As the boat races to catch up
with the charging giants.

788
00:56:16.456 --> 00:56:19.626
skipper Tad must get his boat
right alongside them.

789
00:56:28.343 --> 00:56:29.636
PAUL: Okay. there's two whales.

790
00:56:30.387 --> 00:56:32.180
Now there's three whales in the frame.

791
00:56:33.065 --> 00:56:35.567
Okay. there's one
dead center in the frame.

792
00:56:36.101 --> 00:56:37.561
This is great position. Tad.

793
00:56:38.729 --> 00:56:42.190
Oh. he's coming up right here.
right here. this is good.

794
00:56:43.983 --> 00:56:45.752
Stay in and let these guys catch up.

795
00:56:47.195 --> 00:56:49.823
NARRATOR: By combining
Paul's underwater and surface filming

796
00:56:51.408 --> 00:56:53.493
with aerial footage by helicopter...

797
00:56:54.786 --> 00:56:57.205
PAUL: Oh. this is great. Tad. Hold this.

798
00:56:57.827 --> 00:57:02.044
...he starts to reveal the intensity
of this battle like never before.

799
00:57:05.047 --> 00:57:07.841
Okay. there's one below that's coming.
This is great position. Tad.

800
00:57:08.508 --> 00:57:12.137
PAUL: And he's coming up right here.
right here. this is good.

801
00:57:15.432 --> 00:57:16.433
Wow.

802
00:57:16.850 --> 00:57:17.851
Geez.

803
00:57:23.065 --> 00:57:25.108
NARRATOR:
All the whales dive down into the deep.

804
00:57:30.238 --> 00:57:31.490
PAUL: Diving. diving.

805
00:57:33.033 --> 00:57:34.419
And there they go.

806
00:57:35.077 --> 00:57:37.287
Now. we can see them all
diving towards the bottom.

807
00:57:37.454 --> 00:57:38.914
going down about 200 feet.

808
00:57:40.499 --> 00:57:42.167
Sometimes it goes... so we can follow them

809
00:57:42.334 --> 00:57:43.919
straight down the bottom
and you see them.

810
00:57:44.169 --> 00:57:46.380
Looks like they're rubbing on the bottom
at 200 feet.

811
00:57:46.755 --> 00:57:48.256
If we could get a camera down there.

812
00:57:48.423 --> 00:57:50.550
we might find out
where's it's all really happening.

813
00:57:50.926 --> 00:57:53.971
Maybe that's where the actual mating
is occurring.

814
00:57:54.846 --> 00:57:56.056
-Who knows?
-Coming up.

815
00:57:56.223 --> 00:57:57.599
They're still stuck on us right here.

816
00:57:57.975 --> 00:58:00.352
NARRATOR:
Suddenly. erupting back up from the deep.

817
00:58:00.727 --> 00:58:03.772
the conflict resumes
at an even greater pace.

818
00:58:05.107 --> 00:58:06.817
Yeah. yeah. yeah. because this is...

819
00:58:07.442 --> 00:58:09.486
Yeah. this is really getting good.

820
00:58:10.988 --> 00:58:14.199
NARRATOR: Over 25 male whales
charge past the camera.

821
00:58:14.658 --> 00:58:16.785
blowing streams off aggressive bubbles.

822
00:58:17.536 --> 00:58:19.037
-PAUL: Lot of bubbles.
-MAN: Yeah.

823
00:58:19.496 --> 00:58:20.914
-PAUL: Tons of bubbles.
-MAN: Coming up.

824
00:58:29.881 --> 00:58:32.968
NARRATOR: Those in the rear
try to force the front-runners under.

825
00:58:34.011 --> 00:58:38.765
ruthlessly ramming them to slow them down
and take the lead nearest to the female.

826
00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:47.441
This is the most immense
ocean competition in nature.

827
00:58:52.195 --> 00:58:54.448
Finally. as the other males tire.

828
00:58:54.717 --> 00:58:57.826
the two fastest and strongest
take primary positions

829
00:58:59.327 --> 00:59:01.121
hot on the heels of the female.

830
00:59:13.967 --> 00:59:16.887
In the last moments.
a challenger lunges forward

831
00:59:17.154 --> 00:59:18.864
and forces his rival under...

832
00:59:21.641 --> 00:59:23.060
and out of the race...

833
00:59:24.853 --> 00:59:27.522
claiming his place as the victor.

834
00:59:34.821 --> 00:59:35.906
And they're gone.

835
00:59:37.908 --> 00:59:39.117
PAUL: And there they go.

836
00:59:43.622 --> 00:59:46.374
NARRATOR: This battle is finally over.

837
00:59:48.919 --> 00:59:52.297
One mighty humpback has fought
and won the right

838
00:59:52.589 --> 00:59:55.300
to be the protector of our lone female.

839
01:00:01.973 --> 01:00:05.018
Filming this magnificent event
was only possible

840
01:00:05.227 --> 01:00:08.855
because protection has allowed
whale societies to rebuild.

841
01:00:12.317 --> 01:00:16.071
Unfortunately.
such success stories are rare.

842
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:18.406
And unlike the humpbacks.

843
01:00:19.074 --> 01:00:21.785
the populations
of our ocean's greatest predators

844
01:00:22.202 --> 01:00:23.620
are in huge decline.

845
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.671
Over a hundred million sharks
are fished each year

846
01:00:33.421 --> 01:00:36.466
to satisfy the demands
of the shark finning industry.

847
01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:42.472
Giants like the tiger shark
are becoming increasingly rare.

848
01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:48.145
And their overblown reputation
as frightening and deadly predators

849
01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:50.147
has not helped them.

850
01:00:58.446 --> 01:01:01.283
Paul. however. having filmed sharks
for many years.

851
01:01:01.533 --> 01:01:04.619
knows they are nothing like
this cartoonish stereotype.

852
01:01:07.038 --> 01:01:09.833
The first time I saw sharks underwater.
what impressed me was

853
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.461
how extraordinarily beautiful they are.
how graceful they are.

854
01:01:13.837 --> 01:01:18.008
how perfectly adapted that
they're swimming and how agile they are.

855
01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:21.094
And then. the next thing
that impresses you about sharks.

856
01:01:21.386 --> 01:01:23.430
because you grow up with all of this fear.

857
01:01:23.638 --> 01:01:25.807
is they don't seem
to be threatening you.

858
01:01:26.224 --> 01:01:27.893
PAUL: They don't seem to be that scary.

859
01:01:33.607 --> 01:01:35.192
When tiger sharks show up...

860
01:01:36.318 --> 01:01:38.403
their presence
kind of dominates the scene.

861
01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:41.456
Pretty much. you have your attention
on the tiger shark.

862
01:01:41.907 --> 01:01:43.116
and you never turn your back on it.

863
01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:46.411
because they tend to know
which direction you're looking at.

864
01:01:47.078 --> 01:01:49.206
and they tend to want to come up
behind you.

865
01:01:54.377 --> 01:01:57.172
But they like to test.
they like to see what you are.

866
01:01:57.339 --> 01:02:01.384
And part of that testing
can be pushing its nose into you.

867
01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:07.891
And what you can do
is just put your hand on its nose

868
01:02:08.016 --> 01:02:09.726
and just gently push them away.

869
01:02:10.185 --> 01:02:13.188
PAUL: What other predator on land
could you do that with?

870
01:02:13.438 --> 01:02:16.733
If you did it with bears
that were feeding. or lions. or tigers.

871
01:02:17.275 --> 01:02:18.735
you'd probably get mauled.

872
01:02:19.361 --> 01:02:22.656
And yet. here with one of the biggest.
baddest. predators on the planet.

873
01:02:23.114 --> 01:02:25.116
in terms of the way we feel about them.

874
01:02:25.450 --> 01:02:27.744
and it's perfectly safe to do that. so...

875
01:02:39.881 --> 01:02:42.676
NARRATOR: Sharks are not only
misunderstood by humans.

876
01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:47.514
but their important role in maintaining
a well-balanced ocean ecosystem

877
01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:49.683
is often overlooked.

878
01:02:55.647 --> 01:02:58.650
A healthy coral reef has many sharks.

879
01:02:59.025 --> 01:03:03.321
but in today's oceans. these reefs
are increasingly hard to find.

880
01:03:06.992 --> 01:03:09.494
Underwater cinematographer.
Denis Lagrange.

881
01:03:09.744 --> 01:03:13.540
has known for years
about one of the last strongholds on Earth

882
01:03:14.045 --> 01:03:16.849
for large gatherings of grey reef sharks.

883
01:03:17.544 --> 01:03:22.048
He's in French Polynesia. preparing
to dive these shark-infested waters.

884
01:03:30.265 --> 01:03:34.686
On an incoming tide. hundreds
of reef sharks school in this channel.

885
01:03:44.446 --> 01:03:48.116
Like Paul. Denis has no fear
of these apex predators.

886
01:03:48.533 --> 01:03:51.036
for he knows he is not on their menu.

887
01:03:52.746 --> 01:03:55.915
DENIS: For me. sharks are
one of the most of incredible creature

888
01:03:56.082 --> 01:03:58.251
in the ocean. and you really feel it.

889
01:04:02.881 --> 01:04:05.884
And when we have
all these sharks gather together

890
01:04:06.217 --> 01:04:08.011
and they're really concentrated.

891
01:04:08.428 --> 01:04:10.180
it's an amazing spectacle.

892
01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:14.021
and French Polynesia is the last place.
I think. in the world.

893
01:04:14.196 --> 01:04:15.821
where you can see that.

894
01:04:18.521 --> 01:04:22.150
We try to justify why sharks
should be saved and not killed.

895
01:04:22.484 --> 01:04:26.821
try to fight against shark finning.
but I think it's important to repeat it

896
01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.366
because they are
at the top of the food chain.

897
01:04:29.949 --> 01:04:32.577
They're cleaning the reef
of all natural sickness.

898
01:04:52.514 --> 01:04:56.935
So. if you have no predators.
the reef will just not be in good shape.

899
01:04:57.227 --> 01:04:58.395
It's a reality.

900
01:04:59.437 --> 01:05:01.314
We have to try our best
to protect the shark.

901
01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:04.859
And French Polynesia.
it's one of the only country in the world

902
01:05:05.235 --> 01:05:07.821
who really protect the shark.
It's written in the law.

903
01:05:08.154 --> 01:05:11.241
You're not allowed to kill sharks.
you're not allowed to fish sharks.

904
01:05:12.784 --> 01:05:15.120
NARRATOR: And the protection of sharks
in these waters

905
01:05:15.286 --> 01:05:18.289
allows them to fulfil their role
as vital hunters.

906
01:05:20.458 --> 01:05:22.961
But most sharks don't hunt
during daylight hours.

907
01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:26.548
The serious hunting action occurs
after dark.

908
01:05:28.341 --> 01:05:31.386
So. Denis's next dive
would be a much greater challenge.

909
01:05:32.262 --> 01:05:36.307
filming sharks hunting at night
for his very first time.

910
01:05:39.894 --> 01:05:42.397
They put on special chainmail shark suits

911
01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:46.109
designed to stop a reef shark's teeth
from puncturing the skin.

912
01:05:48.278 --> 01:05:50.947
Sharks don't often
intentionally bite humans.

913
01:05:51.739 --> 01:05:55.618
But in the heat of a feeding frenzy.
it's wise to take precautions.

914
01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:00.457
We expect a lot of shark action tonight.

915
01:06:02.333 --> 01:06:03.751
I hope we will survive.

916
01:06:04.335 --> 01:06:06.129
-MAN: Should we go now?
-We should go.

917
01:06:06.504 --> 01:06:07.505
Yeah.

918
01:06:09.424 --> 01:06:11.092
-MAN: Are we good?
-Are we good?

919
01:06:11.593 --> 01:06:12.677
Yeah.

920
01:06:15.763 --> 01:06:18.391
NARRATOR:
It's more like a special forces operation.

921
01:06:19.517 --> 01:06:20.727
And it needs to be.

922
01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:41.831
NARRATOR:
A few sharks appear straight away.

923
01:06:44.918 --> 01:06:46.503
Then the numbers build quickly.

924
01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:56.137
DENIS:
When you first dive down to the reef

925
01:06:56.554 --> 01:06:59.682
and you see this amazing
number of sharks altogether.

926
01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:01.935
you feel a little scared.

927
01:07:09.734 --> 01:07:11.361
NARRATOR: The surface team is anxious.

928
01:07:11.986 --> 01:07:14.572
They can see the sharks
amassing from above.

929
01:07:16.241 --> 01:07:20.495
DENIS: We've never seen that before.
Daytime. the shark kind of lazy.

930
01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:22.872
but as soon as you're diving
at night with them.

931
01:07:23.498 --> 01:07:25.917
you really see how powerful they can be.

932
01:07:32.298 --> 01:07:34.926
NARRATOR: While the fish
remain hidden. they are safe.

933
01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:43.268
But a nervous reef fish breaks cover...

934
01:07:44.519 --> 01:07:46.229
and the feeding frenzy is on.

935
01:07:47.355 --> 01:07:50.316
DENIS: To be eaten by a shark
is a really big issue.

936
01:07:50.567 --> 01:07:54.153
When you have hundreds of them
in front of you or coming right at you.

937
01:07:54.445 --> 01:07:56.990
they don't care about you.
they just want the fish.

938
01:08:20.054 --> 01:08:21.764
DENIS: No. no. no. no. no!

939
01:08:30.914 --> 01:08:32.775
On l'a fait! On l'a fait!

940
01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:38.656
No. but then you have to pay attention

941
01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:40.450
-to the little fish going between us.
-Oh là là.

942
01:08:40.575 --> 01:08:42.368
-yeah. yeah. yeah.
-"Get away. get away."

943
01:08:42.619 --> 01:08:45.455
When they're frenzy. you know.
there are a lot of them.

944
01:08:45.747 --> 01:08:48.958
DENIS: If they come to you.
I mean. they kick you down.

945
01:08:49.208 --> 01:08:52.920
I really felt it. you know.
a little fish went out of the coral.

946
01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:55.673
and they went on it.
and they don't care about you.

947
01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.216
you know. just going for the fish.

948
01:08:57.550 --> 01:09:01.638
It was like a river. water flowing.
And then afterwards. another image.

949
01:09:02.305 --> 01:09:05.308
he was the middle of the LA.
Los Angeles traffic.

950
01:09:05.433 --> 01:09:07.185
-MAN: You know. like in the movie?
-

951
01:09:08.686 --> 01:09:11.439
You know. the big turnaround
and. like. cars everywhere.

952
01:09:12.106 --> 01:09:15.735
Huh? Highway. but full of cars.
like big traffic jam.

953
01:09:15.902 --> 01:09:17.612
and this was Denis in the middle of that.

954
01:09:17.904 --> 01:09:20.114
-I went to LA...
-It was just like flowing.

955
01:09:20.865 --> 01:09:22.950
like water. sharks flowing around him.

956
01:09:26.037 --> 01:09:29.791
They've been around here.
they've been here for 400 million years.

957
01:09:30.667 --> 01:09:33.711
I mean. those species are like...
When you see them hunting.

958
01:09:34.253 --> 01:09:37.674
it's like. you know. okay.
evolution made them so powerful.

959
01:09:37.924 --> 01:09:39.092
It's like the top.

960
01:09:39.926 --> 01:09:42.261
When they hunt.
it's just like beautiful to watch.

961
01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:43.721
Beautiful.

962
01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:54.982
NARRATOR:
On our cinematographers' quest

963
01:09:55.233 --> 01:09:58.778
to share with you
a tiny glimpse into a dolphin's world.

964
01:09:59.779 --> 01:10:01.572
they visited some unique places.

965
01:10:02.281 --> 01:10:05.284
many of which
are some of the last examples

966
01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:07.495
of thriving ocean communities.

967
01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:12.041
Healthy coral reefs. rich in life.

968
01:10:12.375 --> 01:10:16.295
once fringed every landmass
across our tropical oceans...

969
01:10:17.588 --> 01:10:20.174
yet today. very few remain.

970
01:10:21.259 --> 01:10:23.636
We are killing them.

971
01:10:26.597 --> 01:10:28.850
Pollution and unsustainable fishing

972
01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:33.229
are just a few of the destructive
practices causing their demise.

973
01:10:44.490 --> 01:10:48.494
Sadly. during the three years it took
for the team to make this film.

974
01:10:49.078 --> 01:10:52.498
a third of the Great Barrier Reef
bleached and died.

975
01:10:55.710 --> 01:10:59.464
Without immediate action.
most scientists agree

976
01:10:59.714 --> 01:11:04.677
that almost all coral reefs
will be destroyed in just 50 years.

977
01:11:06.637 --> 01:11:09.015
Countless creatures will cease to exist.

978
01:11:11.184 --> 01:11:14.353
And our dolphins will have lost
their vital home.

979
01:11:18.983 --> 01:11:24.113
But there is hope.
with one of the simplest of solutions...

980
01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:26.824
protection.

981
01:11:29.786 --> 01:11:34.957
The best example.
the islands of Palau in Micronesia.

982
01:11:36.876 --> 01:11:40.171
Didier has come here
to film a very special event.

983
01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:45.468
DIDIER: So. when I knew I was going
to go to Palau. I was very excited

984
01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:47.011
because I have never been.

985
01:11:48.346 --> 01:11:52.600
When I first put my head in the water.
I realized how beautiful it was.

986
01:11:54.435 --> 01:11:57.271
It's that sort of place
where you have strong upwellings

987
01:11:57.563 --> 01:11:59.774
bringing rich water from the depths.

988
01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:02.068
very rich in nutrients.

989
01:12:02.443 --> 01:12:05.655
Makes a top-class reef. very rich in life.

990
01:12:06.096 --> 01:12:07.614
with all those fish everywhere.

991
01:12:08.825 --> 01:12:10.159
And not only the small ones.

992
01:12:10.952 --> 01:12:12.745
Giants and other predators...

993
01:12:15.248 --> 01:12:17.708
all kind of fish.
We have all the food chain.

994
01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:23.548
Mantas. hundreds of sharks.
everyone is here.

995
01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:32.056
NARRATOR: In 1998.

996
01:12:32.348 --> 01:12:35.768
everyone thought that this reef
might have been lost forever.

997
01:12:37.478 --> 01:12:40.690
An El Niño event had bleached
and killed the coral.

998
01:12:42.733 --> 01:12:45.778
But you-know-who stepped in to clean up...

999
01:12:47.321 --> 01:12:49.407
our trusty bumphead parrotfish.

1000
01:12:51.242 --> 01:12:54.203
And with the added help
of government-enforced protection...

1001
01:12:55.288 --> 01:12:57.498
the reef is now as good as new.

1002
01:13:06.607 --> 01:13:11.696
Not surprisingly. Palau is now famous
for its great fish gatherings.

1003
01:13:12.847 --> 01:13:17.435
Every full moon. all the bumpheads
gather at dawn to spawn.

1004
01:13:19.186 --> 01:13:23.441
This is the legendary spectacle
Didier has come here to film.

1005
01:13:32.533 --> 01:13:35.620
DIDIER: To film the bumpheads spawning
is a special event

1006
01:13:35.912 --> 01:13:38.748
because this is something I do
for the first time.

1007
01:13:40.458 --> 01:13:42.043
First. you see all those fish...

1008
01:13:44.013 --> 01:13:46.756
and it's not ten. 30.
it's hundreds of them.

1009
01:13:48.549 --> 01:13:51.719
They are big massive fish.
like 20. 30 kilos.

1010
01:13:53.971 --> 01:13:56.682
For a cameraman.
this is something unique.

1011
01:14:03.356 --> 01:14:06.359
NARRATOR: Didier must remain poised
and ready the whole time.

1012
01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:10.738
because the actual spawning event
could occur at any moment.

1013
01:14:12.114 --> 01:14:14.158
DIDIER: When they aggregate.
you are on the reef.

1014
01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:17.411
so you wait. you wait.
and all of a sudden.

1015
01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:19.664
they stop to go out in the blue.

1016
01:14:20.081 --> 01:14:22.291
and this is where the action will start.

1017
01:14:23.167 --> 01:14:24.377
This is where...

1018
01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:28.089
things get complicated because you have
to swim against the current.

1019
01:14:28.464 --> 01:14:31.300
and we can't compete with the fish.

1020
01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:33.052
You know. they are much faster than us.

1021
01:14:34.061 --> 01:14:38.182
When the first female comes to spawn.
then they will all come together.

1022
01:14:38.557 --> 01:14:41.018
They go up. swim up.
and all the males follow.

1023
01:14:41.185 --> 01:14:43.396
You have two. three. four.
sometimes up to ten.

1024
01:14:43.763 --> 01:14:47.099
And you have to be very reactive
because this is very fast.

1025
01:14:47.817 --> 01:14:49.694
Not missing any action.

1026
01:14:51.362 --> 01:14:55.741
NARRATOR: Millions of parrotfish eggs
are released into the warm ocean currents.

1027
01:14:56.075 --> 01:14:59.829
creating the next generation
of reef saviors.

1028
01:15:05.376 --> 01:15:08.087
In discovering these spectacles
across the world.

1029
01:15:08.963 --> 01:15:13.050
our filmmakers have also given us
a valuable insight

1030
01:15:13.384 --> 01:15:16.470
into how we can help our fragile oceans.

1031
01:15:21.058 --> 01:15:22.893
With international protection.

1032
01:15:23.561 --> 01:15:27.064
more places like Palau
would be able to recover...

1033
01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:34.739
creating a healthier.
more productive ocean.

1034
01:15:37.908 --> 01:15:40.578
One full of incredible characters...

1035
01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:44.415
-...that can continue to thrive

1036
01:15:45.124 --> 01:15:47.418
long into the future.
