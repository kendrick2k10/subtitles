3
00:02:51.583 --> 00:02:53.583
We've done everything we can.

4
00:02:54.791 --> 00:02:57.375
It would be wise to consider a threshold.

5
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:08.750
Sis... it's not fair to leave him like this.

6
00:03:17.416 --> 00:03:19.208
I'm not giving up on him.

7
00:06:12.541 --> 00:06:13.458
Zurab.

8
00:06:20.416 --> 00:06:22.833
I just heard from the prison.

9
00:06:26.833 --> 00:06:29.958
They're extending your brother's
prison sentence by ten years.

10
00:07:15.583 --> 00:07:17.000
Governor.

11
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.875
Zurab. Always wonderful to see you.

12
00:07:22.083 --> 00:07:23.625
How are you. my friend?

13
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.250
I've been better.

14
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:27.208
One of our prize bulls is sick.

15
00:07:27.208 --> 00:07:29.208
We have to kill him.

16
00:07:29.208 --> 00:07:31.083
Bury him before he infects the others.

17
00:07:31.083 --> 00:07:33.208
You asked me here to commiserate?

18
00:07:35.208 --> 00:07:37.041
Walk with me. would you?

19
00:07:43.041 --> 00:07:45.833
You said it was urgent.

20
00:07:47.291 --> 00:07:49.833
I just heard that this morning
you signed off on

21
00:07:49.833 --> 00:07:52.916
extending my brother's prison sentence
by ten years.

22
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:57.583
Your brother threw a DEA agent off a roof.

23
00:07:58.833 --> 00:08:01.166
The Americans are all over us.

24
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.458
When Davit and I were young.

25
00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:09.500
I was to protect my brother at all costs.

26
00:08:10.291 --> 00:08:12.541
My father would never let me forget it.

27
00:08:13.333 --> 00:08:17.333
I contested his extradition to the States.

28
00:08:18.041 --> 00:08:20.166
Kept him in a Georgian prison.

29
00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:24.750
I even allowed his family
to be housed in prison with him.

30
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.250
Let's not forget who put you
in this office. And why.

31
00:08:30.416 --> 00:08:33.375
I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do.

32
00:08:35.541 --> 00:08:40.083
One of our prize bulls is sick.

33
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:43.333
You told me.

34
00:13:47.416 --> 00:13:50.500
Don't wake them.
It's hard for them to fall asleep in here.

35
00:13:52.083 --> 00:13:53.125
Come.

36
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.458
No.

37
00:13:55.083 --> 00:13:55.958
No?

38
00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.125
Not tonight.

39
00:13:59.458 --> 00:14:01.916
It's been weeks
since they've seen the sun.

40
00:14:02.416 --> 00:14:06.083
They can't survive like this.
It's hard on them.

41
00:14:06.083 --> 00:14:07.375
Hard?

42
00:14:08.666 --> 00:14:10.208
He needs to grow up hard.

43
00:14:10.208 --> 00:14:12.333
There are other places to hide.

44
00:14:12.708 --> 00:14:14.833
Sure. in here your brother protects us.

45
00:14:14.833 --> 00:14:17.500
But I don't want my son
to become a <i>Nagazi.</i>

46
00:14:17.833 --> 00:14:20.041
The last thing I need is your fat mouth.

47
00:14:20.041 --> 00:14:21.583
What are you going to do?

48
00:14:22.375 --> 00:14:24.333
Drag me into your cell?

49
00:14:25.333 --> 00:14:27.041
You forgetting you're my wife?

50
00:14:27.041 --> 00:14:29.375
Not your property.

51
00:14:31.041 --> 00:14:33.166
Maybe I raise them on my own. huh?

52
00:14:34.208 --> 00:14:35.916
You would not be missed.

53
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.041
Mom. you okay?

54
00:15:07.541 --> 00:15:09.750
I thought you were sleeping.

55
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.125
Are you sure you are okay?

56
00:15:22.625 --> 00:15:23.750
I'm fine.

57
00:15:28.625 --> 00:15:30.000
I'm sorry.

58
00:15:30.708 --> 00:15:32.458
It's okay. my love.

59
00:15:34.416 --> 00:15:36.750
Don't worry. It'll be okay.

60
00:15:39.333 --> 00:15:41.125
Maybe Dad is right.

61
00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:45.791
I do need to grow up hard.

62
00:15:46.541 --> 00:15:48.375
So I can become a <i>Nagazi.</i>

63
00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:24.666
We can get a shipment of weapons
to Seoul by tomorrow night.

64
00:20:24.666 --> 00:20:27.875
And my brother Yaz
will fly there to deliver it personally.

65
00:20:28.791 --> 00:20:30.708
I have tickets to the game tomorrow.

66
00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:37.166
Sorry. I have to call you back.

67
00:21:21.541 --> 00:21:22.916
You're going to miss the game.

68
00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:24.666
Fucking hell.

69
00:22:57.833 --> 00:23:00.708
- You're already edgy.
- But I need to talk about it.

70
00:23:08.041 --> 00:23:09.750
- Are you ready?
- Let's go.

71
00:23:19.583 --> 00:23:20.791
Freezing out there.

72
00:23:21.291 --> 00:23:22.666
They don't want to sleep in the cold.

73
00:23:22.666 --> 00:23:24.666
they shouldn't kill people for a living.

74
00:23:59.625 --> 00:24:00.958
207 unlocked.

75
00:24:01.458 --> 00:24:02.791
You got five minutes.

76
00:24:30.458 --> 00:24:33.000
Power is out everywhere.

77
00:24:35.875 --> 00:24:37.791
Going to check it out.

78
00:25:09.208 --> 00:25:10.958
Sandro. wake up. We have to go.

79
00:25:10.958 --> 00:25:12.125
Get dressed.

80
00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:15.708
Who is this man?

81
00:25:15.708 --> 00:25:17.666
He's going to take us out of here.

82
00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:27.375
Put your shoes on.

83
00:25:29.208 --> 00:25:30.791
Where are we going?

84
00:25:31.583 --> 00:25:33.208
I'll tell you later.

85
00:25:40.708 --> 00:25:41.708
Dad?

86
00:25:43.583 --> 00:25:45.375
This man is getting us out of here.

87
00:25:45.375 --> 00:25:47.333
Your father's waiting outside.

88
00:26:33.875 --> 00:26:37.208
<i>Code Red. Security. lock down the exits.</i>

89
00:26:41.583 --> 00:26:45.666
<i>Security breach. All guards. Code Red.</i>

90
00:26:47.916 --> 00:26:50.833
<i>Alert. perimeter breached.
Close down the exits.</i>

91
00:27:07.875 --> 00:27:11.000
<i>Alert. perimeter breached.
Close down the exits.</i>

92
00:29:09.708 --> 00:29:12.750
Don't be afraid.
Go up. and I'll come up too.

93
00:29:21.875 --> 00:29:24.083
Where are you taking my children?
Motherfucker!

94
00:29:31.625 --> 00:29:33.083
You bitch.

95
00:31:32.916 --> 00:31:35.833
<i>Alert. riot in the square.
Lock down the exits.</i>

96
00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:42.041
<i>Alert. riot in the square.
Lock down the exits.</i>

97
00:31:45.458 --> 00:31:48.875
<i>Alert. all units to the prison courtyard.
Close down all the exits.</i>

98
00:31:54.166 --> 00:31:57.875
<i>Code Red. Security. lock down the exits.</i>

99
00:32:27.916 --> 00:32:32.000
<i>Close all gates. Guards. get to the walls.</i>

100
00:36:41.166 --> 00:36:43.291
Where's Father? You told me he was coming.

101
00:36:43.291 --> 00:36:45.333
He'll meet us later.

102
00:38:43.166 --> 00:38:44.333
What do they know?

103
00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:03.541
- Why are Uncle's men shooting at us?
- Are you okay?

104
00:39:38.583 --> 00:39:39.958
Don't they know we're in this car?

105
00:41:34.541 --> 00:41:36.291
It hurts!

106
00:43:14.458 --> 00:43:15.625
Reaper Team. in position.

107
00:43:16.083 --> 00:43:17.208
Move. move.

108
00:43:26.833 --> 00:43:28.416
Reaper 1 and 2.
you have to stop this train.

109
00:43:28.916 --> 00:43:30.666
Copy. moving toward the engine.

110
00:43:33.375 --> 00:43:34.250
Go. go!

111
00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:26.583
Reaper 1 is down.

112
00:44:27.166 --> 00:44:28.041
Breaching!

113
00:47:14.416 --> 00:47:15.583
What's going on?

114
00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:32.791
I'm sorry.

115
00:48:35.208 --> 00:48:37.500
This was deeply resourced.

116
00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:39.791
Lead operative was A-plus.

117
00:48:40.333 --> 00:48:41.875
There's maybe four or five guys

118
00:48:41.875 --> 00:48:43.125
who could've done this to us.

119
00:48:43.541 --> 00:48:44.791
Was this the Chechens?

120
00:48:44.791 --> 00:48:46.666
It's not their style.

121
00:48:46.666 --> 00:48:48.666
They don't organize like this.

122
00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:50.791
Someone wanted revenge.

123
00:48:50.791 --> 00:48:53.375
With your brother. that's no short list.

124
00:48:54.416 --> 00:48:55.458
No.

125
00:48:57.208 --> 00:48:59.958
This wasn't revenge.

126
00:49:02.833 --> 00:49:05.041
This was something else.

127
00:49:37.125 --> 00:49:38.750
Where's Father?

128
00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:41.375
There isn't time for this.
Your sister needs help.

129
00:49:41.375 --> 00:49:42.708
I'm not leaving without him.

130
00:49:42.708 --> 00:49:45.125
- Come on. Your sister needs help.
- I'm not going.

131
00:49:45.708 --> 00:49:47.625
Your father isn't coming.

132
00:49:50.833 --> 00:49:52.125
Is he dead?

133
00:50:09.333 --> 00:50:10.500
Please. Sandro.

134
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:34.250
Davit!

135
00:51:35.541 --> 00:51:36.458
I tried to protect him.

136
00:51:36.458 --> 00:51:38.250
Is this protection?

137
00:51:40.416 --> 00:51:43.750
You fight for your brother
till your last drop of blood.

138
00:52:06.916 --> 00:52:08.916
Full medical detail.

139
00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:11.416
I need you to meet us
at Donau-City Strasse.

140
00:52:43.666 --> 00:52:45.666
Calm down. She's just trying to help.

141
00:52:45.666 --> 00:52:47.083
Don't patronize me.

142
00:52:47.458 --> 00:52:49.750
A doctor will be there when we land.
Try to rest.

143
00:53:19.416 --> 00:53:21.125
You are a brave girl.

144
00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:25.875
I'm listening.

145
00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:28.958
Uncle... It's me. Sandro.

146
00:54:29.291 --> 00:54:31.041
Sandro? Where are you?

147
00:54:32.791 --> 00:54:34.875
Was my father going to kill my mother?

148
00:54:37.291 --> 00:54:38.125
Sandro--

149
00:54:38.125 --> 00:54:39.333
Answer me!

150
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:44.000
Don't listen to anything your mother says.
you understand me?

151
00:54:45.375 --> 00:54:46.833
She did this.

152
00:54:47.875 --> 00:54:50.375
She had your father killed. Understand?

153
00:54:52.583 --> 00:54:55.583
She has wanted to take you away
from your father for years.

154
00:54:57.208 --> 00:55:00.000
<i>And now you are with the man
who killed him.</i>

155
00:55:01.625 --> 00:55:02.791
<i>So where are you?</i>

156
00:55:06.375 --> 00:55:08.291
You're a <i>Nagazi.</i> Be your father's son.

157
00:55:10.166 --> 00:55:12.083
Where are you heading?

158
00:55:15.666 --> 00:55:17.583
<i>Where are you heading?</i>

159
01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:33.291
This is the most important thing
I will ever ask you to do.

160
01:00:33.708 --> 01:00:35.583
To rectify this desecration.

161
01:00:36.958 --> 01:00:39.750
This filth came to our home
and murdered our family.

162
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:41.458
Our brothers.

163
01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:46.000
By God's law. he must die by our hand.

164
01:00:47.666 --> 01:00:50.875
You are my brothers. My life is yours.

165
01:00:51.625 --> 01:00:54.416
I'll follow you to the end.

166
01:00:54.958 --> 01:00:56.666
My life is yours.

167
01:00:57.333 --> 01:00:58.250
And mine.

168
01:01:19.041 --> 01:01:20.875
You're throwing their lives away.

169
01:01:21.125 --> 01:01:23.416
This path doesn't end well.

170
01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:31.083
"You fight for your brother
till your last drop of blood."

171
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.416
I haven't forgotten my father's lesson.

172
01:01:35.250 --> 01:01:36.458
Have you?

173
01:05:17.583 --> 01:05:18.750
Up or down?

174
01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:20.875
They'll come down. More options.

175
01:05:22.083 --> 01:05:23.166
The children?

176
01:05:28.125 --> 01:05:30.666
"Meet me in the back alley."

177
01:05:40.458 --> 01:05:41.708
What did you do?

178
01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:43.333
I'm sorry. Mama...

179
01:05:43.333 --> 01:05:46.208
Sandro... What did you do? How could you?!

180
01:05:46.208 --> 01:05:48.666
He doesn't care about you!

181
01:05:48.666 --> 01:05:51.333
He's gonna kill us!

182
01:05:51.875 --> 01:05:53.666
The <i>Nagazi</i> are my family.

183
01:06:03.125 --> 01:06:04.666
I am your family.

184
01:06:05.375 --> 01:06:07.291
Nina is your family!

185
01:08:25.208 --> 01:08:27.416
We need backup!

186
01:09:14.666 --> 01:09:15.541
Come. boy.

187
01:09:19.458 --> 01:09:20.583
Don't listen to him.

188
01:09:25.041 --> 01:09:26.291
Come back to us.

189
01:09:31.875 --> 01:09:33.083
Come to your family.

190
01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:08.291
It wasn't my mother's fault.

191
01:10:08.291 --> 01:10:10.541
She just wanted us to get out of there.

192
01:10:14.916 --> 01:10:17.000
Get in the car. stay here!

193
01:10:19.291 --> 01:10:20.333
Watch the boy.

194
01:11:44.291 --> 01:11:45.833
Team three. take them out.

195
01:11:46.333 --> 01:11:47.250
Quick.

196
01:12:07.625 --> 01:12:09.125
They're up top.

197
01:12:09.541 --> 01:12:11.375
Force them back into the building.

198
01:12:41.083 --> 01:12:42.916
<i>Pin him in!</i>

199
01:13:07.958 --> 01:13:09.458
Commander. do we have permission
to engage?

200
01:13:09.458 --> 01:13:11.041
Shooters on the roof.

201
01:13:11.208 --> 01:13:12.500
<i>Cleared to engage.</i>

202
01:13:13.833 --> 01:13:15.125
<i>Police!</i>

203
01:14:15.458 --> 01:14:16.333
Reload!

204
01:15:25.291 --> 01:15:27.458
- Team one. they're headed to you.
- We're ready.

205
01:15:31.666 --> 01:15:34.250
Sergo. Konstantine. secure the entrance.
Everyone else. up top.

206
01:15:47.458 --> 01:15:48.416
You okay?

207
01:15:49.958 --> 01:15:51.333
You're gonna be okay.

208
01:15:53.875 --> 01:15:54.875
I am sorry.

209
01:15:56.541 --> 01:15:58.541
I'm so sorry I dragged you into this.

210
01:16:15.250 --> 01:16:16.750
Is he going to kill my mother?

211
01:16:20.583 --> 01:16:23.208
If you wanted her alive.

212
01:16:23.666 --> 01:16:25.625
you shouldn't have called.

213
01:21:13.291 --> 01:21:14.458
Traitor!

214
01:25:17.583 --> 01:25:18.541
What happened?

215
01:28:09.041 --> 01:28:10.500
I thought I would never see you again.

216
01:28:42.416 --> 01:28:44.000
The whole country is looking for us.

217
01:28:46.125 --> 01:28:47.958
Then go. get on the plane.

218
01:28:56.250 --> 01:28:57.958
We lost ten <i>Nagazi</i> today.

219
01:28:58.208 --> 01:28:59.916
Good soldiers.

220
01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:01.541
It's enough.

221
01:29:01.875 --> 01:29:03.000
Don't be afraid.

222
01:29:03.916 --> 01:29:04.875
It'll be fine.

223
01:29:09.833 --> 01:29:11.958
Be an example to Sandro.

224
01:29:13.250 --> 01:29:14.916
You're no good to him dead.

225
01:29:14.916 --> 01:29:16.791
or rotting in an Austrian prison.

226
01:29:16.791 --> 01:29:19.666
How can I be an example to Sandro.

227
01:29:19.666 --> 01:29:21.583
if I run away?

228
01:29:22.375 --> 01:29:24.250
Let's ask God.

229
01:29:34.791 --> 01:29:37.708
"Fear not. for I'm with you."

230
01:29:40.208 --> 01:29:42.250
"The Lord is near to the brokenhearted."

231
01:29:42.250 --> 01:29:43.625
I know. I've read it.

232
01:29:45.791 --> 01:29:47.791
I once believed God took your hearing.

233
01:29:48.125 --> 01:29:52.958
so he could whisper right into your ear.

234
01:29:55.041 --> 01:29:57.000
But now you only hear your rage.

235
01:29:58.458 --> 01:30:00.666
You know who my father
used to compare you to?

236
01:30:01.416 --> 01:30:03.666
Do you remember the cricket
from the movie?

237
01:30:03.666 --> 01:30:05.750
The one who sits on the boy's nose.

238
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:07.666
Always chirping nonsense in his ear.

239
01:30:07.666 --> 01:30:09.833
Chirping and chirping. again and again.

240
01:30:10.750 --> 01:30:11.833
Do you remember it?

241
01:30:13.250 --> 01:30:15.291
And where is your father now?

242
01:30:18.541 --> 01:30:19.833
Where is your brother?

243
01:30:40.291 --> 01:30:42.458
I always knew
there was a bullet waiting for me.

244
01:30:43.833 --> 01:30:47.416
but not from your gun.

245
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.166
Sweetheart.

246
01:31:15.958 --> 01:31:17.416
You got so big.

247
01:31:19.791 --> 01:31:22.333
Aunt Mia's going to take us
somewhere safe. Okay?

248
01:31:23.333 --> 01:31:24.958
Is Sandro coming?

249
01:36:55.208 --> 01:36:56.083
Hurry up.

250
01:38:54.416 --> 01:38:55.875
Go. Take his gun.

251
01:38:58.791 --> 01:39:00.583
Don't make me tell you again.

252
01:39:51.666 --> 01:39:53.333
I said to point the gun at him.

253
01:40:05.250 --> 01:40:07.208
This is the man who killed your father.

254
01:40:09.250 --> 01:40:10.333
Avenge him.

255
01:40:26.958 --> 01:40:28.166
Pull the trigger.

256
01:41:03.291 --> 01:41:04.500
Disappointing.

257
01:41:34.750 --> 01:41:37.083
I'm going to blow his asshole face off.

258
01:44:46.166 --> 01:44:47.166
I will not...

259
01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:48.833
stop.
