3
00:00:26.736 --> 00:00:30.239
I dreamed about this shit as a kid.

4
00:00:34.702 --> 00:00:38.497
I could zone out for hours
and just be in a fairyland.

5
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:45.755
I'ma be a real millionaire.

6
00:00:45.838 --> 00:00:47.465

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:04.482
I ain't know how.

10
00:01:04.565 --> 00:01:08.235

11
00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:10.946
But. I was gonna get there.

12
00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:14.158
No matter what.

13
00:02:56.552 --> 00:02:59.722
Baby's coming down. speed cameras.

14
00:06:51.078 --> 00:06:57.584
I could fuck up and he could be like me.

15
00:28:06.977 --> 00:28:08.562
Play the whole verse over.

16
00:28:24.161 --> 00:28:25.704
Keep that.

17
00:28:25.788 --> 00:28:27.331
Play it. let me know how it sounds.

18
00:29:39.153 --> 00:29:40.946

to get this dude.

19
00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:42.907

20
00:29:45.075 --> 00:29:46.660

00:29:55.961 --> 00:29:59.340
I'm on the ground with this.
I'm personally touching this.

25
00:31:20.212 --> 00:31:23.299
C'mon man. let me go to sleep.

26
00:31:23.382 --> 00:31:24.466
I've been at it.

27
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:05.878
If I'm in the crowd I'm learning with you.

28
00:34:05.961 --> 00:34:07.671
I say "Lil" y'all say "Baby"

29
00:34:07.755 --> 00:34:09.381
Lil "Baby." Lil "Baby"

30
00:34:09.465 --> 00:34:11.008
You know. and then by the time

31
00:34:11.091 --> 00:34:13.719
it's time to bring him
out it's already a vibe.

32
00:34:13.802 --> 00:34:17.931
Some of the stuff I'ma mute it
'cause I'ma let you go over the crowd.

33
00:34:20.184 --> 00:34:22.978
I gotta learn how to talk to the crowd.
I don't talk to the crowd.

34
00:34:23.771 --> 00:34:25.230
Like I don't talk to the crowd.

35
00:34:25.314 --> 00:34:26.732
I don't say shit!

36
00:34:27.274 --> 00:34:28.692
I swear to God I don't say shit

37
00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:32.613

38
00:34:38.952 --> 00:34:39.661

You can't be scared
'cause I'm scared already!

42
00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:48.170
Both of us can't be scared!

43
00:34:48.253 --> 00:34:49.505
When I first walked on the stage.

44
00:34:49.588 --> 00:34:51.256

45
00:34:52.633 --> 00:34:54.635

57
00:54:13.501 --> 00:54:16.587
And what's continuing to go on.

58
00:59:14.927 --> 00:59:17.012
Mhm?

59
00:59:17.096 --> 00:59:20.724
You know that man who died. George Floyd?

60
00:59:20.808 --> 00:59:22.726
The one who couldn't breathe?

61
00:59:22.810 --> 00:59:26.730
Right. the one who the police killed?

62
00:59:26.814 --> 00:59:29.275
His daughter. she's turning six years old

63
00:59:29.358 --> 00:59:32.695
and she's having a birthday party.

64
00:59:33.153 --> 00:59:35.239
I'm gonna pay for her birthday party.

65
00:59:35.322 --> 00:59:36.156

66
00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:37.408

67
00:59:37.491 --> 00:59:39.034

68
00:59:39.118 --> 00:59:40.160
Alright.

69
00:59:40.244 --> 00:59:43.247
Alright. I'll be home in a minute.

70
01:00:55.944 --> 01:00:56.904

71
01:00:56.987 --> 01:00:58.822
Hell yeah. I'm alright man

72
01:00:58.906 --> 01:01:01.241
Man. I'm just happy to be around

73
01:01:01.325 --> 01:01:03.744
be able to do what a n**** doing.

74
01:07:13.947 --> 01:07:16.491
Y'all don't got no coats?

75
01:07:17.909 --> 01:07:21.204
No I don't have no coat.

76
01:07:21.288 --> 01:07:23.832
Y'all don't got no coats?
You don't got no coat little man?

77
01:08:42.077 --> 01:08:46.623
Ain't nothing like where you come from.
you know what I'm saying?

78
01:08:46.706 --> 01:08:51.503
But I get the chills from
that type of stuff though.

79
01:08:52.546 --> 01:08:55.257
I got more love than anything.

80
01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:57.884
I done helped some of
them with their businesses

81
01:08:57.968 --> 01:09:00.512
it's like check-up. like

82
01:09:00.595 --> 01:09:02.681
What you doing? What you been up to?

83
01:09:02.764 --> 01:09:05.100
Or I see the people I grew up with

84
01:09:05.183 --> 01:09:07.894
I used to be bad as hell.
now I ain't seen them in a minute.

85
01:09:10.730 --> 01:09:12.941
N****s I go to school with...

86
01:09:13.024 --> 01:09:15.652
they been to prison. who out of prison

87
01:09:15.735 --> 01:09:17.654
I coulda went that route.
I coulda went this route.

88
01:09:17.737 --> 01:09:19.322
This could be my reality.

89
01:09:19.406 --> 01:09:21.575
That shit give me the chills.
you know what I'm saying?

90
01:12:49.407 --> 01:12:51.576
And then. I guess
the last question here is

91
01:12:51.659 --> 01:12:53.912
Could you tell -
and you can talk to the camera.

92
01:12:53.995 --> 01:12:55.371
What it means to be heard?

93
01:12:55.455 --> 01:12:59.334
And what it's like to help
other people's voices be heard.

94
01:13:55.932 --> 01:13:58.601
Turn that TV off.

95
01:19:31.225 --> 01:19:33.019
I think she just want to make sure

96
01:19:33.102 --> 01:19:34.687
in certain moments

97
01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:36.731
you passionate
in the moment of performing.

98
01:19:36.814 --> 01:19:38.274
I'm telling her like though

99
01:19:38.357 --> 01:19:39.942
you don't even gotta tell me that.

100
01:19:40.026 --> 01:19:40.776
Because you already know what to do.

101
01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:42.320
This is like...

102
01:19:42.403 --> 01:19:44.739
I'm serious about this.

103
01:19:44.822 --> 01:19:47.492
I'm telling her I'm gonna be
there on the floor. Everything.

104
01:19:47.575 --> 01:19:49.827
I got it. I'm gonna goddamn perform.

105
01:19:49.911 --> 01:19:52.163
She's like "you better perform."

106
01:19:52.246 --> 01:19:53.206
Because this is one of them moments.

107
01:19:53.289 --> 01:19:54.707
it's a big moment.

108
01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:56.751
This is gonna be like a...

109
01:19:56.834 --> 01:19:58.544
a moment.

110
01:19:58.628 --> 01:20:01.672
It's a different platform.

111
01:20:01.756 --> 01:20:05.468
It's gonna be on some whole other shit.

112
01:20:05.551 --> 01:20:08.387
Some of these people not
even heard this song before

113
01:20:08.471 --> 01:20:10.806
and it's gonna be on some
what the hell is this?

114
01:20:28.407 --> 01:20:30.535
They killing all the rappers
so I wore a vest.

115
01:20:31.911 --> 01:20:34.080
They killing rappers so I wore a vest!

116
01:20:34.163 --> 01:20:35.998
The vest too big though.

117
01:20:37.917 --> 01:20:40.169
Man I could perform in this. Britney.

118
01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:50.555
Yeah you know I'm grateful
to be here today. man.

119
01:20:50.638 --> 01:20:52.557
Could be somewhere selling dope.

120
01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.978
I've got my acceptance speech!

121
01:20:57.061 --> 01:20:58.229
I'm grateful to be here

122
01:20:58.312 --> 01:21:01.691
I could be somewhere selling dope.

123
01:21:10.908 --> 01:21:13.452
Oh the Grammys said they want him there?

124
01:21:13.536 --> 01:21:14.704
On the day?

125
01:21:14.787 --> 01:21:19.667
Well that must mean
that they gon' give him

126
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:20.751
an award.

127
01:21:20.835 --> 01:21:21.877
I think you're gonna win.

128
01:21:23.129 --> 01:21:25.047
But they got some kind of crazy voting

129
01:21:25.131 --> 01:21:27.550
and whoever their board is

130
01:21:27.633 --> 01:21:29.427
it go off of their board.

131
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:32.597
It ain't going off popular vote so

132
01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:33.973
I don't know it be tricky with-

133
01:21:34.056 --> 01:21:37.268
Your performance is the
only one that's outdoors.

134
01:21:37.351 --> 01:21:40.396
We're closing LA Live
and Staples Center down.

135
01:21:40.479 --> 01:21:41.689
Like it doesn't really make sense.

136
01:21:41.772 --> 01:21:43.899
I'd be very surprised if you didn't win.

137
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:05.272
It's okay. you're rich!

138
01:24:56.008 --> 01:24:57.510
I'm going on TV. Britney.

139
01:24:57.593 --> 01:24:59.428
You gon' kill this shit.

140
01:30:37.307 --> 01:30:39.935
I can see my plan. what I'm trying to do.

141
01:30:40.018 --> 01:30:41.979
it's gon' work.

142
01:30:48.235 --> 01:30:52.948
I'ma have a full legacy.
it's just gon' be started from rap.

143
01:30:54.658 --> 01:30:56.743
'Cause I took it to this
point in three years.

144
01:30:56.827 --> 01:31:00.289
I plan on living to at least
like sixty. seventy.

145
01:31:00.372 --> 01:31:02.666
That's a long time from now.

146
01:31:05.419 --> 01:31:06.628
Even though I got to this point

147
01:31:06.712 --> 01:31:08.589
where it's damn near you
can ask a question like

148
01:31:08.672 --> 01:31:09.965
"What do you think
your legacy is going to be?"

149
01:31:10.048 --> 01:31:11.258
'cause I done built a legacy

150
01:31:11.341 --> 01:31:14.803
where if I stop right now
I could leave it.

151
01:31:14.887 --> 01:31:17.806
It's already a full one
if I stopped today.

152
01:31:19.766 --> 01:31:23.061
But man. you gotta just
imagine what I'm finna do.

153
01:31:23.145 --> 01:31:26.732
Now that my brain is untrapping.

154
01:31:28.358 --> 01:31:31.111
I'll never be trapped again.

155
01:31:32.779 --> 01:31:35.991
I'm just getting started.
