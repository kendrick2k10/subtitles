00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:51.677
<i>We're here for a reason.</i>

4
00:00:51.677 --> 00:00:54.972
<i>Put on this earth
for a higher purpose.</i>

5
00:00:54.972 --> 00:00:56.974
<i>I have to believe that.</i>

6
00:00:56.974 --> 00:00:59.351
<i>I have to believe
that there's a higher purpose</i>

7
00:00:59.351 --> 00:01:03.814
<i>for me being here on this
corner at this time of day.</i>

8
00:01:03.814 --> 00:01:06.984
<i>Looking at those
fucking doors again.</i>

9
00:01:06.984 --> 00:01:08.944
<i>I'm worried
that you get too close.</i>

10
00:01:08.944 --> 00:01:11.446
<i>- Yeah. I'm getting close.</i>
- Too close to that world.

11
00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:14.867
You don't kill anybody. Don't
shoot him in the face. okay?

12
00:01:14.867 --> 00:01:16.493
Where's his fucking money?

13
00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:22.249
<i>But I'm early
and in no rush whatsoever</i>

14
00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:24.668
<i>to find
out what that purpose is.</i>

15
00:01:24.668 --> 00:01:27.129
<i>The why can wait. but the how.</i>

16
00:01:27.129 --> 00:01:31.091
<i>that's actually a pretty
good story.</i>

17
00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:32.968
You tell them
you're an architect.

18
00:01:32.968 --> 00:01:35.345
You can go with a doctor
or a lawyer if you want.

19
00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:37.973
but I'm telling you
the chicks can somehow sniff
those out right away.

20
00:01:37.973 --> 00:01:39.641
Why don't you just
tell them the truth?

21
00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:41.310
The second
you tell them you're a cop.

22
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.687
you can see the hamster wheel
start turning.

23
00:01:43.687 --> 00:01:45.814
They go through every
bad thing they've done.

24
00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:47.608
Wondering how it can be used
against them.

25
00:01:47.608 --> 00:01:50.277
So you tell them
that you're an architect.

26
00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:53.155
It's a desk job.
Relatable. safe.

27
00:01:53.155 --> 00:01:55.616
but distinguished enough.
Not scare them off.

28
00:01:55.616 --> 00:02:00.329
And architects make money.
so that helps.

29
00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.247
What happens when they find out
you're lying?

30
00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:03.290
Never happens.

31
00:02:04.708 --> 00:02:07.920
I got to say. you know...

32
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.965
Sounds good and all but I mean
dating sounds like a nightmare.

33
00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:14.134
It is. You're a lucky man.

34
00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:16.595
Married to a great woman.

35
00:02:16.595 --> 00:02:19.473
Yeah...

36
00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:21.475
Trouble at home?

37
00:02:21.475 --> 00:02:23.810
Yeah.

38
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.521
I don't want to talk about it.

39
00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:28.899
It's the job.
You need to find a balance.

40
00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:34.112
I used to buy her flowers.
you know. just because.

41
00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:36.865
And then it was only on
special occasions. right?

42
00:02:36.865 --> 00:02:38.909
But those became
too few to count.

43
00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.369
and then it was only
when I fucked up.

44
00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:44.581
and. you know.
I fucked up a lot.

45
00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:46.917
So eventually. you know.

46
00:02:46.917 --> 00:02:49.628
flowers didn't mean
anything anymore.

47
00:02:49.628 --> 00:02:52.297
so I stopped.

48
00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:54.842
Sounds like you do
want to talk about it.

49
00:02:54.842 --> 00:02:58.679
Bobby. go back
home to your wife.

50
00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:01.723
get her some flowers
and get that balance back.

51
00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:14.695
Hey.

52
00:03:14.695 --> 00:03:15.779
Bobby.

53
00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:17.489
Shut your mouth.

54
00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.284
Hey. don't you talk
to her like that.

55
00:03:23.287 --> 00:03:24.997
Why don't you shut
your mouth too?

56
00:03:27.416 --> 00:03:29.585
I got you flowers.

57
00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:34.214
Maybe you should
just leave. man.

58
00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:39.928
<i>I should have taken
his advice. But instead...</i>

59
00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:41.638
Bobby. stop!

60
00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:43.682
<i>I decided to
redecorate my kitchen.</i>

61
00:03:43.682 --> 00:03:47.269
Stop! Stop.

62
00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.189
Stop! Bobby. please. stop!

63
00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:58.071
Please!

64
00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:23.722
<i>There's a moment
right before you're fully awake</i>

65
00:04:23.722 --> 00:04:27.476
<i>where there's
a slight chance that you
could still be dreaming.</i>

66
00:04:27.476 --> 00:04:31.980
<i>And then comes the moment
when you realize you're not.</i>

67
00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:36.735
<i>I've been married
for almost ten years</i>

68
00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:39.738
<i>and a cop for almost twelve.</i>

69
00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:41.406
Well. how do you know that

70
00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:44.535
he doesn't have
a license for that?

71
00:04:44.535 --> 00:04:47.246
No. no. that's
because you think that.

72
00:04:47.246 --> 00:04:50.749
You think that. See. you
can't make assumptions.

73
00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:53.210
Yeah. Yeah.

74
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.796
Hey. there's a fresh pot
over there if you're interested.

75
00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:59.258
I got to call you back.
Okay. Bye bye.

76
00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:03.971
You're going
to be here for a while.

77
00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:05.138
you should make the most of it.

78
00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:07.516
Oh. yeah? How do I do that?

79
00:05:07.516 --> 00:05:09.268
Start typing. See what happens.

80
00:05:09.268 --> 00:05:11.228
Tell you exactly
what's going to happen.

81
00:05:11.228 --> 00:05:14.106
I'm going to make one typo
and this typewriter

82
00:05:14.106 --> 00:05:16.108
is going straight
out the goddamn window.

83
00:05:16.108 --> 00:05:19.236
Maybe. Maybe. You'll like it.

84
00:05:19.236 --> 00:05:23.282
Who knows. maybe you're
the next Ernest Hemingway.

85
00:05:26.243 --> 00:05:29.246
Yeah. I'm going to get
a cup of coffee
and get that window open.

86
00:05:29.246 --> 00:05:31.290
That's a start.

87
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.543
<i>They let me keep my badge.
but took my gun.</i>

88
00:05:34.543 --> 00:05:36.920
<i>I guess it was a smart move
or else my brains</i>

89
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.464
<i>would be all over this
coffee machine right now.</i>

90
00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:42.676
Hey. you got a minute?

91
00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:46.471
<i>I put the guy in the hospital.
And they put me behind a desk.</i>

92
00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:50.934
-  <i>Pat to Baker's office.</i>
-  It's Rick.

93
00:05:50.934 --> 00:05:52.936
How are you doing. Pam?<i>-Good. Rick and you?</i>

94
00:05:52.936 --> 00:05:55.022
Yeah. I'm okay.<i>-What can I do for you?</i>

95
00:05:55.022 --> 00:05:56.481
Is the chief around?

96
00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:57.816
<i>Sure. Just hold a minute.</i>

97
00:05:57.816 --> 00:05:59.026
Okay. Thank you.

98
00:05:59.026 --> 00:06:00.903
You got till I get off hold.

99
00:06:00.903 --> 00:06:02.946
You need to give me
something more than paperwork

100
00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:05.824
to keep me busy. I mean. I'm
losing my mind behind that desk.

101
00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:09.286
I really feel for you.
what you're going through
with Mary.

102
00:06:09.286 --> 00:06:13.624
It breaks my heart.
But my hands are tied.

103
00:06:13.624 --> 00:06:16.710
You're lucky that they're
allowing you in this building.

104
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.629
Lucky. Rick. you got
to do something.

105
00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:21.089
First of all. it's captain.

106
00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:22.674
It's not Rick.

107
00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:25.093
Second of all.
I did do something.

108
00:06:25.093 --> 00:06:26.386
And you know what?

109
00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:27.721
That's why you're standing

110
00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:29.181
in my office and you're

111
00:06:29.181 --> 00:06:31.099
not standing
on an unemployment line.

112
00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:33.018
He was sleeping
with my wife. Rick.

113
00:06:33.018 --> 00:06:34.561
And what did you do?

114
00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:36.396
- You disfigured him?
- I broke his nose.

115
00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:39.441
Okay? Let's not get
too dramatic here.

116
00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:41.818
<i>- Captain Callahan?</i>
- Yes. Pam.

117
00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:43.946
<i>Can you hold for
a teensy bit longer?</i>

118
00:06:43.946 --> 00:06:48.033
Okay. sweetheart.
You have a teensy bit longer.

119
00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:50.786
Listen. I know. I just.

120
00:06:50.786 --> 00:06:53.664
sometimes I get
a bit of a hot head.

121
00:06:53.664 --> 00:06:56.291
Hot head?
You went fucking nuclear.

122
00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:57.876
You should have seen him. Rick.
I mean.

123
00:06:57.876 --> 00:07:00.170
You should have just
walked out of there

124
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.090
like I suggest that
you walk out of here now.

125
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:08.262
I don't have time to
babysit your conscience.

126
00:07:08.262 --> 00:07:11.056
I'm under a lot of stress
with this department.

127
00:07:11.056 --> 00:07:13.058
<i>- Captain Callahan?</i>
- Yes.

128
00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:14.476
<i>I'm going to
put you through now.</i>

129
00:07:14.476 --> 00:07:16.436
Okay. thank you. Hold.

130
00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:21.483
Close the door behind you. okay?

131
00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:23.861
Hey. Captain Callahan.
Hi. sir. How you doing?

132
00:07:31.076 --> 00:07:34.037
<i>♪ Welcome back ♪</i>

133
00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:37.249
<i>♪ Welcome back. welcome back ♪</i>

134
00:07:37.249 --> 00:07:39.585
<i>♪ Welcome back ♪</i>

135
00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:13.285
I told you. this was
some Grade-A shit.

136
00:08:13.285 --> 00:08:14.995
It's great man.
some Grade-A shit.

137
00:08:14.995 --> 00:08:17.122
You know what?
Fucking take it or leave it.

138
00:08:17.122 --> 00:08:19.208
<i>In a situation like this.</i>

139
00:08:19.208 --> 00:08:23.378
<i>I'm required
to step in and regulate.</i>

140
00:08:23.378 --> 00:08:26.548
<i>But I was too drunk
to give a shit.</i>

141
00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:27.841
Cut you the--

142
00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:29.676
<i>Chris Rosenberg.</i>

143
00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:32.095
<i>He might have looked
like a dirtbag drug dealer</i>

144
00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:34.806
<i>mainly because that's
exactly what he was.</i>

145
00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:36.642
<i>He was pretty good at it. too.</i>

146
00:08:36.642 --> 00:08:39.520
<i>So good. in fact. that one day
someone noticed.</i>

147
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.772
<i>Roy DeMeo.</i>

148
00:08:41.772 --> 00:08:44.149
<i>If the devil
decided to walk to Earth.</i>

149
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:47.694
<i>he'd do it as Roy DeMeo
and no one would be the wiser.</i>

150
00:08:47.694 --> 00:08:49.738
<i>Roy loved his big brother. Anthony.</i>

151
00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:52.366
<i>I mean. he fucking
idolized him.</i>

152
00:08:52.366 --> 00:08:55.702
<i>But Roy's life changed forever
in the spring of '51</i>

153
00:08:55.702 --> 00:09:00.082
<i>when Anthony came back
from Korea in a body bag.</i>

154
00:09:00.082 --> 00:09:02.251
<i>By the time
he was out of high school.</i>

155
00:09:02.251 --> 00:09:05.295
<i>Roy had a pretty good
loan shark and racket going.</i>

156
00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:07.840
<i>Business was good.
mainly because everyone</i>

157
00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.299
<i>knew not to mess with Roy.</i>

158
00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:11.134
<i>By the late '60s.</i>

159
00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:13.053
<i>Roy was running
with the Gambino family.</i>

160
00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:15.806
<i>Anthony Gaggi.</i>

161
00:09:15.806 --> 00:09:17.432
<i>Everybody called him Nino.</i>

162
00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:20.769
<i>He was a capo
in the Gambino family.</i>

163
00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:23.605
<i>Roy had his fingers
in everything
from loan sharking</i>

164
00:09:23.605 --> 00:09:25.858
<i>to grand theft auto
to drug dealing.</i>

165
00:09:25.858 --> 00:09:27.568
<i>The Gambinos frowned
upon the last one.</i>

166
00:09:27.568 --> 00:09:30.070
<i>but Roy became one
of their top earners.</i>

167
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:33.156
<i>So they kept him
as their dirty little secret.</i>

168
00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:34.783
<i>Roy took Chris under his wing.</i>

169
00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:36.326
<i>He saw something in him.</i>

170
00:09:36.326 --> 00:09:38.871
<i>Chris became
Roy's right hand man.</i>

171
00:09:38.871 --> 00:09:40.831
<i>But that night.
I didn't know any of that.</i>

172
00:09:40.831 --> 00:09:43.625
<i>All I knew was some asshole
was about to get killed</i>

173
00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:46.086
<i>by another asshole.</i>

174
00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:50.132
<i>And in that moment.
something in the me just...</i>

175
00:09:58.807 --> 00:10:02.102
<i>I took out
every raw deal I can dealt
in my life until then.</i>

176
00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:05.230
<i>Right into this poor
bastard's fucking face.</i>

177
00:10:14.615 --> 00:10:18.160
Ah. fuck. I didn't mean to...

178
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.664
Thanks. You got a car?

179
00:10:27.753 --> 00:10:30.047
So. what do you do. Bobby?

180
00:10:30.047 --> 00:10:32.257
I'm an architect.

181
00:10:32.257 --> 00:10:35.552
Architect? You build
houses and shit?

182
00:10:35.552 --> 00:10:36.803
Yeah.

183
00:10:40.224 --> 00:10:42.100
Yeah. I don't buy it.

184
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.520
You're just too shitty
to be an architect.

185
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.773
Well. you know.
I'm a shitty architect.

186
00:10:51.693 --> 00:10:53.529
- Thanks for the ride.
- Oh. yeah.

187
00:10:53.529 --> 00:10:56.281
And. uh. you know. thanks
for stepping in back there.

188
00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:59.243
Oh. yeah. don't mention it.

189
00:10:59.243 --> 00:11:01.620
Appreciate
if you didn't. either.

190
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.455
Mum's the word.

191
00:11:03.455 --> 00:11:05.499
<i>You know...</i>

192
00:11:05.499 --> 00:11:07.042
Chris.

193
00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:08.627
<i>...for a degenerate scumbag...</i>

194
00:11:08.627 --> 00:11:11.296
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah.

195
00:11:11.296 --> 00:11:14.216
<i>...this guy was all right.</i>

196
00:11:14.216 --> 00:11:16.343
Mum's the word.

197
00:11:28.105 --> 00:11:30.440
It was a Cadillac. Gold.

198
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.109
We just bought it.

199
00:11:32.109 --> 00:11:34.611
When you say gold.
you mean yellow?

200
00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:36.947
What difference does it make?
I saw the guy.

201
00:11:36.947 --> 00:11:39.116
he was about 5'9. 5'10.

202
00:11:39.116 --> 00:11:41.201
You know. that real
distinguished type. with the...

203
00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:43.954
- Ma'am. Ma'am.
- a mustache.

204
00:11:43.954 --> 00:11:46.623
Not trying to be rude.
but nine times out of ten

205
00:11:46.623 --> 00:11:48.375
you know what happens
when a car gets stolen?

206
00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:49.960
It stays stolen.

207
00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.670
Look. I'll take a report.
but I can't

208
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.047
promise you any miracles.

209
00:11:54.047 --> 00:11:57.009
So what the fuck
am I paying taxes for?

210
00:12:04.641 --> 00:12:06.977
You ever hear
of the Gemini Lounge?

211
00:12:06.977 --> 00:12:09.479
The place on Flatlands?

212
00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:12.900
Yeah. it's a mob watering hole.

213
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.569
You think any big fish
swim around in there?

214
00:12:15.569 --> 00:12:19.406
Big. small. probably
a couple of barracudas also.

215
00:12:51.188 --> 00:12:53.023
<i>I was looking at pieces
of a puzzle</i>

216
00:12:53.023 --> 00:12:54.942
<i>with no idea
how they fit together.</i>

217
00:12:54.942 --> 00:12:59.279
<i>But it was enough
to get me off my ass.</i>

218
00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:02.491
<i>I felt like
I had a purpose again.</i>

219
00:13:02.491 --> 00:13:04.451
<i>All I had to do was prove it.</i>

220
00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:07.454
<i>How fucking hard could that be?</i>

221
00:13:08.872 --> 00:13:10.999
Go away. I'm busy.

222
00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:16.797
Do you know how knocking works?

223
00:13:16.797 --> 00:13:18.715
First you knock on the door.

224
00:13:18.715 --> 00:13:20.467
You wait for the other person
on the other side of the door

225
00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:23.929
to respond to you.
What did you do?

226
00:13:23.929 --> 00:13:26.598
- I got a lead.
- You got a what?

227
00:13:26.598 --> 00:13:28.809
I met this guy last night.

228
00:13:28.809 --> 00:13:30.853
- Good for you.
- I did some digging.

229
00:13:30.853 --> 00:13:35.941
And he's part
of Roy DeMeo's crew.

230
00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:42.406
Roy DeMeo. Do you even
have a fucking clue who he is?

231
00:13:42.406 --> 00:13:45.742
- I think I got something here.
- You know what you got?

232
00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:49.329
You got a ton of paperwork
on your desk. A mountain.

233
00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:51.790
And if you don't get
going processing that shit

234
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:54.001
it's going to
become two mountains.

235
00:13:54.001 --> 00:13:56.003
I mean.
these are mobsters. Rick.

236
00:13:56.003 --> 00:13:59.214
We got stacks of files
on these guys.
Just gathering dust.

237
00:13:59.214 --> 00:14:01.216
Bobby. you know
what mobsters are?

238
00:14:01.216 --> 00:14:03.635
They're fucking animals.
You know what they do?

239
00:14:03.635 --> 00:14:05.637
They kill each other.
And you know what?

240
00:14:05.637 --> 00:14:07.264
They got my blessing.

241
00:14:07.264 --> 00:14:09.975
We can set something up here.
something big.

242
00:14:09.975 --> 00:14:12.477
I mean. I can go undercover.

243
00:14:12.477 --> 00:14:14.730
- Undercover?
- Yeah. Remember that Queens job?

244
00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:16.690
I was on that job
for three months.

245
00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.525
Nobody could have done that
better than me. You know that.

246
00:14:18.525 --> 00:14:20.777
You know what I got here?
You see this?

247
00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:23.780
This is paperwork telling me

248
00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.742
that this is the end
of the police department
as we know it.

249
00:14:26.742 --> 00:14:30.329
I got budget cuts.
I got layoffs.
I got financial problems.

250
00:14:30.329 --> 00:14:31.788
We were on thin ice.

251
00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:33.665
Get this out of
your fucking head.

252
00:14:33.665 --> 00:14:37.377
Bobby. I love you. but get
this out of your head. please.

253
00:14:45.427 --> 00:14:51.808
<i>If I ever needed proof
that I was a colossal asshole.
this was it.</i>

254
00:14:51.808 --> 00:14:55.187
<i>I was at my wit's end. I mean.
the bottom of the barrel.</i>

255
00:14:55.187 --> 00:14:57.022
<i>Especially when it came to her.</i>

256
00:15:20.879 --> 00:15:23.006
What are you doing here. Bobby?

257
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:25.634
Can I see her?

258
00:15:28.136 --> 00:15:30.097
You really scared her.

259
00:15:30.097 --> 00:15:31.682
Did you know about it?

260
00:15:34.142 --> 00:15:38.438
You mean Bobby. what did
you think was gonna
happen? Come on.

261
00:15:38.438 --> 00:15:40.065
I mean. I don't know.

262
00:15:40.065 --> 00:15:41.275
I definitely didn't think
she was gonna

263
00:15:41.275 --> 00:15:42.776
go off and fuck another guy.

264
00:15:42.776 --> 00:15:45.028
Hey. listen to me. They didn't.

265
00:15:46.905 --> 00:15:49.324
She didn't.

266
00:15:49.324 --> 00:15:52.619
She needed someone.
and he was there. okay?
You weren't. Bobby.

267
00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:54.288
Can I just talk to her? Mary.

268
00:15:54.288 --> 00:15:56.164
Mary. can I just talk
to you for five minutes?

269
00:15:56.164 --> 00:15:58.834
Just five minutes. please.

270
00:15:58.834 --> 00:16:00.878
Come on.

271
00:16:02.212 --> 00:16:06.091
Come here. I'm right here.

272
00:16:06.091 --> 00:16:08.552
Hey.

273
00:16:08.552 --> 00:16:14.016
Wow. wow. you look. uh.
you look great.

274
00:16:16.059 --> 00:16:19.354
Listen. I want you
to know that. uh.

275
00:16:19.354 --> 00:16:22.566
I know how I get sometimes.

276
00:16:22.566 --> 00:16:25.360
And I'm working really hard
to not be that way.

277
00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.989
You know. the captain says
I'm getting a promotion.

278
00:16:28.989 --> 00:16:31.909
Just around the corner.
I mean. things are goin' up.

279
00:16:31.909 --> 00:16:35.287
I quit drinking.
I'm doing pushups every day.

280
00:16:35.287 --> 00:16:37.456
You know I want
to get better for you.

281
00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:40.751
I know. I know.

282
00:16:40.751 --> 00:16:42.461
Broken record. right?

283
00:16:42.461 --> 00:16:45.964
But this time
it's different. I swear. just...

284
00:16:45.964 --> 00:16:48.175
Bob...

285
00:16:48.175 --> 00:16:50.928
Just give me one
more chance. Mary.

286
00:16:50.928 --> 00:16:52.554
Bobby. I...

287
00:16:54.681 --> 00:16:58.227
I don't have anything more
to give you.

288
00:17:01.605 --> 00:17:04.942
- I can't do this.
- Hey. hey.
You can't do what. Mary?

289
00:17:04.942 --> 00:17:06.610
You can't do what?

290
00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:08.862
Just look me in the eyes.

291
00:17:08.862 --> 00:17:12.157
Look me in the eyes
and tell me that you don't
love me anymore. huh?

292
00:17:12.157 --> 00:17:14.159
Just tell me that you don't
love me anymore.

293
00:17:14.159 --> 00:17:18.539
Tell me that you're willing to
throw away the last ten years.

294
00:17:18.539 --> 00:17:20.165
And I'll leave.

295
00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:22.167
I'm just asking you for

296
00:17:22.167 --> 00:17:23.877
one more chance. Mary.

297
00:17:23.877 --> 00:17:25.796
Please.

298
00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:30.467
All right. all right. Go inside.

299
00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:32.219
Bobby. come on stop it.

300
00:17:32.219 --> 00:17:34.429
Just give her some time. okay. honey?

301
00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:36.849
- Yeah.
- Just some time.

302
00:17:36.849 --> 00:17:39.726
Yeah.

303
00:17:39.726 --> 00:17:42.729
<i>I needed to get busy and quick.</i>

304
00:17:42.729 --> 00:17:45.983
<i>If I wanted everyone's respect
back. especially Mary's.</i>

305
00:17:45.983 --> 00:17:49.069
<i>I was going to have to take it.
not wait for their permission.</i>

306
00:17:49.069 --> 00:17:51.113
<i>And if I was
going to do it at all.</i>

307
00:17:51.113 --> 00:17:53.615
<i>I would have to do it right.</i>

308
00:17:58.704 --> 00:18:01.415
<i>It's I had Chris's
routine down to T.</i>

309
00:18:01.415 --> 00:18:04.042
<i>I even knew his favorite brand
of cigarettes.</i>

310
00:18:08.714 --> 00:18:11.884
<i>It was now or fucking never.</i>

311
00:18:11.884 --> 00:18:14.678
<i>This was really
where the barracuda swam.</i>

312
00:18:14.678 --> 00:18:16.471
<i>It was time I went fishing.</i>

313
00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:49.713
<i>Joseph Guglielmo.
They called him Dracula.</i>

314
00:18:49.713 --> 00:18:51.548
<i>You don't get a nickname
like that for giving</i>

315
00:18:51.548 --> 00:18:53.300
<i>off warm. fuzzy vibes.</i>

316
00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.052
- Goddamn it. Joe!
- Now what?

317
00:18:55.052 --> 00:18:56.887
You gotta call the Armenian.

318
00:18:56.887 --> 00:18:58.722
The girls' toilet's
back up again.

319
00:18:58.722 --> 00:19:00.682
- Ah. jeez.
- I'm wearing sandals.

320
00:19:00.682 --> 00:19:02.476
You better tell him
to come quick so I could

321
00:19:02.476 --> 00:19:04.895
- drown him in that bowl.
- Okay. all right. All right.

322
00:19:04.895 --> 00:19:06.146
What'll it be?

323
00:19:06.146 --> 00:19:09.233
Um. just a bourbon.

324
00:19:09.233 --> 00:19:12.694
<i>Gina stuck out like a daisy
among the weeds in there.</i>

325
00:19:12.694 --> 00:19:15.239
<i>She was a niece or someone's
cousin or something</i>

326
00:19:15.239 --> 00:19:18.700
<i>and completely crazy to be
working in a place like that.</i>

327
00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.495
Hey. Gina. come here.
I want to talk to you.

328
00:19:21.495 --> 00:19:25.082
- Ugh. yeah?
- When we going out on that
dinner date you and me. huh?

329
00:19:25.082 --> 00:19:28.794
Um. last time I checked.
hell still hasn't frozen over.

330
00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.506
<i>That orangutan was Luca Santi.</i>

331
00:19:32.506 --> 00:19:35.509
<i>The only thing bigger than
his mouth was his debt to Roy.</i>

332
00:19:35.509 --> 00:19:37.344
So what's a pretty girl
like you know about hell?

333
00:19:37.344 --> 00:19:39.555
Keep pushing your luck
and you'll find out.

334
00:19:39.555 --> 00:19:42.516
Holy shit.
That's that fucking guy.
you see that fucking guy.

335
00:19:42.516 --> 00:19:44.393
That's the guy I was
telling you about.

336
00:19:44.393 --> 00:19:47.521
- Loverboy over here.
- With the thing. the architect.

337
00:19:47.521 --> 00:19:48.605
Fuck you guys.

338
00:19:48.605 --> 00:19:50.148
Get lost.

339
00:19:52.442 --> 00:19:53.443
Billy.

340
00:19:54.278 --> 00:19:56.738
- Bobby. Bobby.
- Bobby. right?

341
00:19:56.738 --> 00:19:58.156
The architect.

342
00:19:58.156 --> 00:20:01.285
Yeah. well. you know.
not anymore.

343
00:20:01.285 --> 00:20:02.995
Oh. you get shit-canned?

344
00:20:02.995 --> 00:20:05.247
Is that why're you here
drowning your sorrows?

345
00:20:05.247 --> 00:20:08.083
Uh. let's just say that.
you know.

346
00:20:08.083 --> 00:20:10.752
building shit houses
wasn't for me.

347
00:20:10.752 --> 00:20:13.547
You know what is for you.
Hey. Gina. Gina.

348
00:20:13.547 --> 00:20:16.008
Get this fucking guy
whatever he wants. all right?

349
00:20:16.008 --> 00:20:18.343
Want another?

350
00:20:18.343 --> 00:20:20.804
So. what are
you doing here. Bobby?

351
00:20:20.804 --> 00:20:26.226
Well. you know.
a bar is a bar. right?

352
00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:29.438
Bar is a bar. that's right.

353
00:20:29.438 --> 00:20:32.024
But what are you doing here?

354
00:20:32.024 --> 00:20:33.984
This is a lounge.

355
00:20:36.403 --> 00:20:38.238
What's the difference?

356
00:20:41.116 --> 00:20:42.409
It's a good question.

357
00:20:42.409 --> 00:20:43.994
Gina. Joseph. Bobby.

358
00:20:43.994 --> 00:20:46.163
Bobby. Gina. Joseph.
Gina's the pretty one.

359
00:20:46.163 --> 00:20:49.374
- Hey. I'm pretty.
- Yeah. your mother's a liar.

360
00:20:49.374 --> 00:20:52.336
- Architect huh?
- Yeah.

361
00:20:52.336 --> 00:20:55.923
Nice. A lot of school for that?

362
00:20:55.923 --> 00:20:58.175
I'm more of the
learn by doing type.

363
00:20:58.175 --> 00:21:00.385
- I like that.
- Want another one?

364
00:21:00.385 --> 00:21:01.720
Oh. please.

365
00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.056
- Make it a double.
- Please.

366
00:21:04.056 --> 00:21:05.849
You sure you're
in the right place?

367
00:21:05.849 --> 00:21:08.310
He's in the right place.
Listen. later on tonight.

368
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:10.145
my buddies got a place
right next door.

369
00:21:10.145 --> 00:21:11.688
Going to play cards.
You should come by.

370
00:21:11.688 --> 00:21:13.565
Yeah. cards. Okay.

371
00:21:13.565 --> 00:21:15.359
Get him the fuck
out of here. Cheers.

372
00:21:15.359 --> 00:21:17.402
You don't fucking
play cards anyway.

373
00:21:17.402 --> 00:21:19.571
- I should get going here.
- Nah. come on.

374
00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:21.573
What. you got
somewhere you got to be?

375
00:21:23.242 --> 00:21:24.743
Fuck it. All right.

376
00:21:24.743 --> 00:21:25.869
- Come on.
- Thanks for the drink.

377
00:21:29.831 --> 00:21:32.292
Ignore these guys. Hey. guys.

378
00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:35.087
Bobby. this is the guys.
This is the guy I was telling
you about. the architect.

379
00:21:35.087 --> 00:21:39.341
This is Louis. This is Gianni.
This is Freddie. Guys. Bobby.

380
00:21:39.341 --> 00:21:40.634
Hey. take a seat.

381
00:21:40.634 --> 00:21:43.804
How you doing. Bobby?

382
00:21:43.804 --> 00:21:47.266
<i>Freddie DiNome.
Freddie was a pro
race car driver</i>

383
00:21:47.266 --> 00:21:49.893
<i>who was probably born
with a wrench in his hand.</i>

384
00:21:49.893 --> 00:21:52.062
<i>He ran a body shop
and was pretty much</i>

385
00:21:52.062 --> 00:21:54.314
<i>the head of the crew's
auto theft ring.</i>

386
00:21:54.314 --> 00:21:57.025
<i>He also stood so close to
your face when he talked</i>

387
00:21:57.025 --> 00:21:58.735
<i>to you that you could
have guessed what he had</i>

388
00:21:58.735 --> 00:22:00.362
<i>had for lunch that day.</i>

389
00:22:00.362 --> 00:22:02.531
Chris says you got his back
the other night.

390
00:22:05.409 --> 00:22:09.663
<i>On account of how bad
his breath was.
my guess was always shit.</i>

391
00:22:09.663 --> 00:22:11.540
I'm telling you. you should
have seen this guy's face

392
00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:12.833
after Bobby was done with him.

393
00:22:12.833 --> 00:22:15.169
looked like fucking mincemeat.

394
00:22:15.169 --> 00:22:16.712
Did he kill him?

395
00:22:16.712 --> 00:22:19.464
<i>Louis Russo and Gianni Russo.</i>

396
00:22:19.464 --> 00:22:21.008
<i>The Gemini brothers.</i>

397
00:22:21.008 --> 00:22:23.093
<i>Roy DeMeo was the devil.</i>

398
00:22:23.093 --> 00:22:25.596
<i>Louie and Gianni
were his top demons.</i>

399
00:22:25.596 --> 00:22:27.890
<i>They were good thieves
and good killers.</i>

400
00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:29.266
<i>Perfect soldiers.</i>

401
00:22:29.266 --> 00:22:30.851
No. no. I didn't kill him.

402
00:22:30.851 --> 00:22:32.936
I mean. he was still
breathing when I left.

403
00:22:32.936 --> 00:22:34.521
- Barely
- Ah. barely.

404
00:22:34.521 --> 00:22:36.273
I didn't mean to hurt him
so fucking bad.

405
00:22:36.273 --> 00:22:38.358
But how bad did
you mean to hurt him?

406
00:22:38.358 --> 00:22:40.402
You know. just enough so that
he couldn't remember

407
00:22:40.402 --> 00:22:43.071
his own fucking name for
a couple of weeks. I don't know.

408
00:22:44.656 --> 00:22:46.617
- Tough guy.
- We got a Marciano over here.

409
00:22:47.659 --> 00:22:49.203
Marciano over here.

410
00:22:49.203 --> 00:22:50.871
This guy hasn't stopped
talking about you.

411
00:22:50.871 --> 00:22:52.456
Non-fucking-stop he's been
going on about you.

412
00:22:52.456 --> 00:22:54.499
Listen. listen. we can
always use an extra

413
00:22:54.499 --> 00:22:56.502
pair of hands around here.

414
00:22:56.502 --> 00:22:58.837
What you think of
a career change. kid?

415
00:22:58.837 --> 00:23:00.631
Fuck.

416
00:23:00.631 --> 00:23:02.591
<i>You know. I had to
hold back a bit.</i>

417
00:23:02.591 --> 00:23:03.842
Nah...

418
00:23:03.842 --> 00:23:05.844
<i>Not seem too eager.</i>

419
00:23:05.844 --> 00:23:08.388
You guys are fucking
all right and all.
I mean you know...

420
00:23:08.388 --> 00:23:10.724
Bobby. we're cool
enough for you.

421
00:23:10.724 --> 00:23:12.226
We want to make sure
we're all right for you.

422
00:23:12.226 --> 00:23:13.894
Chris. we're all right.

423
00:23:13.894 --> 00:23:17.814
We're talking about
working in the shade. right?

424
00:23:17.814 --> 00:23:20.067
- The fucking shade?
- What is this. Motown?

425
00:23:20.067 --> 00:23:21.777
What the fuck you talkin' about?

426
00:23:23.779 --> 00:23:27.449
Fucking tell you. definitely
pushing a lot more than pencils.

427
00:23:27.449 --> 00:23:28.742
that's for sure.

428
00:23:28.742 --> 00:23:30.577
Making some good fucking dough.

429
00:23:30.577 --> 00:23:32.371
What would I be doing?

430
00:23:32.371 --> 00:23:35.415
Whatever the fuck it takes.

431
00:23:35.415 --> 00:23:37.042
You in?

432
00:23:41.505 --> 00:23:44.049
I fucking had you. right?
I fucking had you.

433
00:23:44.049 --> 00:23:47.010
He fucked it up.<i>-I knew these guys.</i>

434
00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:48.762
<i>And I knew I had them.</i>

435
00:23:50.931 --> 00:23:53.267
<i>We keep it out of
the books. Off the record.</i>

436
00:23:53.267 --> 00:23:56.144
James can wipe my files.
set me up with a new identity.

437
00:23:56.144 --> 00:23:57.563
If I get one whiff.

438
00:23:57.563 --> 00:23:58.981
that the whole thing's
going south.

439
00:23:58.981 --> 00:24:00.732
I bail. okay? You have my word.

440
00:24:00.732 --> 00:24:01.942
And no one's the wiser.

441
00:24:01.942 --> 00:24:04.695
The answer is still no.

442
00:24:04.695 --> 00:24:06.697
Do you know what
the fuck you're dealing with?

443
00:24:06.697 --> 00:24:08.699
Listen. I've been looking
into a few things and I'm

444
00:24:08.699 --> 00:24:10.492
telling you. this could be huge.

445
00:24:10.492 --> 00:24:13.078
You know what? This might be
a goddamn game to you.

446
00:24:13.078 --> 00:24:14.580
Maybe you're trying
to impress Mary

447
00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:16.290
and get killed
by these scumbags.

448
00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:18.125
but it ain't
going to impress me. okay?

449
00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:23.463
I'm a better man than I've
shown in the past few weeks.

450
00:24:23.463 --> 00:24:24.506
Okay?

451
00:24:27.009 --> 00:24:28.969
Let me prove it.

452
00:24:38.979 --> 00:24:41.315
All right? Let me see
what you got. All right.

453
00:24:41.315 --> 00:24:46.570
Yeah. I mean. I pulled
files on all these guys.

454
00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:48.655
They're all just sitting there.

455
00:24:48.655 --> 00:24:53.577
And I got ins with them.
I got my fucking hooks in.
You know?

456
00:24:53.577 --> 00:24:55.996
You know who you're
dealing with. right?

457
00:24:55.996 --> 00:24:58.290
I'm gonna come
on board with you.

458
00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:01.293
You make sure you tell me every
fucking thing that goes on.

459
00:25:01.293 --> 00:25:02.961
I won't let you down. Rick.

460
00:25:02.961 --> 00:25:05.589
Captain. you have my word.

461
00:25:07.674 --> 00:25:10.010
He has to disappear completely.

462
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:12.054
All his fucking files. Everything.

463
00:25:15.098 --> 00:25:16.975
That's not going
to be easy. Captain.

464
00:25:16.975 --> 00:25:19.061
I can't just snap my fingers.

465
00:25:19.061 --> 00:25:21.188
Jimmy. do it.

466
00:25:21.188 --> 00:25:22.981
You're lucky these guys
aren't from a different borough.

467
00:25:22.981 --> 00:25:24.608
Otherwise my hands
would be tied.

468
00:25:24.608 --> 00:25:26.610
Nobody's to know what
the hell we're doing.

469
00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:29.738
You know it.
he knows it. I know it.
one other person.

470
00:25:29.738 --> 00:25:31.323
The Chief of Internal Affairs.

471
00:25:31.323 --> 00:25:33.450
That's just in case we fuck up

472
00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:35.327
and step on
our cocks. you understand?

473
00:25:35.327 --> 00:25:38.330
All I'm saying is these guys
don't fuck around.

474
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:41.875
I don't fuck around.
And his fucking balls
are on the line.

475
00:25:41.875 --> 00:25:45.671
You ready. son?

476
00:25:45.671 --> 00:25:49.800
By the way. you're going
to be ridin' shotgun.
Protect his ass.

477
00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.134
What?

478
00:25:51.134 --> 00:25:53.011
We're gonna be roommates.

479
00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:05.691
Cozy.

480
00:26:05.691 --> 00:26:07.943
Yeah. you can have the bedroom.

481
00:26:07.943 --> 00:26:10.696
How generous.

482
00:26:10.696 --> 00:26:13.699
Well. let's get to work.

483
00:26:13.699 --> 00:26:16.577
<i>James was thorough.
I had to give him that.</i>

484
00:26:16.577 --> 00:26:20.372
Robert DeBono.

485
00:26:20.372 --> 00:26:24.168
You didn't tell 'em
your last name. did you?

486
00:26:24.168 --> 00:26:27.921
Hey. do you think that
I should leave this behind?

487
00:26:27.921 --> 00:26:31.884
You know. just in case those
fuckers try and frisk me?

488
00:26:31.884 --> 00:26:34.386
You think they checked
you out already?

489
00:26:34.386 --> 00:26:36.638
I didn't put in an application.
James. but. yeah.

490
00:26:36.638 --> 00:26:37.806
I'm pretty
sure I'm in the clear.

491
00:26:37.806 --> 00:26:40.142
You're pretty sure? Heh.

492
00:26:40.142 --> 00:26:42.436
You're pretty sure?

493
00:26:44.313 --> 00:26:46.356
Did anybody ever
mention the Gemini Method?

494
00:26:54.781 --> 00:26:57.701
See all those guys
in those photos?

495
00:26:57.701 --> 00:27:00.245
They went into that apartment
at the back of the club.

496
00:27:00.245 --> 00:27:01.788
They never came out.

497
00:27:05.542 --> 00:27:09.838
A method. The Gemini Method.

498
00:27:09.838 --> 00:27:11.757
It all happens
in that apartment.

499
00:27:17.513 --> 00:27:20.557
<i>It was clear where
Roy DeMeo fit in all this.</i>

500
00:27:20.557 --> 00:27:22.851
<i>But if I was going to get
to him. I had to impress</i>

501
00:27:22.851 --> 00:27:24.853
<i>his flunkies first.</i>

502
00:27:24.853 --> 00:27:28.941
<i>And if I did get to him.
we needed to get him on tape.</i>

503
00:27:38.325 --> 00:27:40.744
I'm going to
get fucking electrocuted.

504
00:27:40.744 --> 00:27:44.164
So. listen. do me a favor.
Don't get it wet.

505
00:27:44.164 --> 00:27:46.708
Don't go in the fucking rain.
What do you want from me?

506
00:27:46.708 --> 00:27:49.628
What I need you to do is
get this guy. Roy DeMeo.

507
00:27:49.628 --> 00:27:53.215
I want him on tape.
giving an order.

508
00:27:53.215 --> 00:27:55.759
If we get that done.
we can get the fuck out

509
00:27:55.759 --> 00:27:57.594
of here and have
a friggin' party.

510
00:27:57.594 --> 00:27:59.596
Cap? Cap. if you want me
to take good pictures.

511
00:27:59.596 --> 00:28:01.932
- I'm going to need more cars.
- Cars?

512
00:28:01.932 --> 00:28:04.935
Yeah to alternate.
I need at least four cars.

513
00:28:04.935 --> 00:28:07.855
Jimmy. You want
a fucking helicopter. too?

514
00:28:07.855 --> 00:28:09.314
These guys are not stupid.

515
00:28:09.314 --> 00:28:10.858
They're going to notice
the same car

516
00:28:10.858 --> 00:28:12.734
on the fucking same
street every day.

517
00:28:12.734 --> 00:28:14.820
They're going to get curious.
They're going to come over.

518
00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:16.071
they're going to see a guy
with a fucking camera
in the car.

519
00:28:16.071 --> 00:28:17.739
I'll give you two fucking cars.

520
00:28:17.739 --> 00:28:19.783
and then I'm going to give you
a longer lens

521
00:28:19.783 --> 00:28:22.077
so could stay two fucking
blocks away. Okay?

522
00:28:22.077 --> 00:28:24.705
I got two cars.
That's what I got now.

523
00:28:24.705 --> 00:28:27.583
- Bobby! Let's go.

524
00:28:27.583 --> 00:28:31.795
All right. Hey. he's here.
he's here. Are you ready?

525
00:28:31.795 --> 00:28:33.589
Bobby. give me a second.
I'll be right there. all right?

526
00:28:33.589 --> 00:28:35.215
Okay. All right.

527
00:28:38.218 --> 00:28:40.345
What the fuck? Let's go!

528
00:28:42.181 --> 00:28:45.184
- Hey.
- Hey. what you going
to a wedding?

529
00:28:45.184 --> 00:28:47.352
I want to make
a good impression.

530
00:28:47.352 --> 00:28:49.438
Whatever. You drivin'. Come on.

531
00:28:49.438 --> 00:28:51.607
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

532
00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:54.610
All right.

533
00:29:04.828 --> 00:29:07.372
<i>DeMeo had no problem
selling this stuff.</i>

534
00:29:07.372 --> 00:29:09.708
<i>but he never wanted
to see his guys doing it.</i>

535
00:29:09.708 --> 00:29:13.253
- You want some?
- No. no. I'm good.

536
00:29:13.253 --> 00:29:15.964
<i>If it wasn't booze or tobacco.
he better not catch</i>

537
00:29:15.964 --> 00:29:18.175
<i>you putting it
anywhere near your lips.</i>

538
00:29:18.175 --> 00:29:20.302
<i>And especially not
up your nose.</i>

539
00:29:34.316 --> 00:29:37.945
<i>If there was one thing
wise guys really
got a kick out of.</i>

540
00:29:37.945 --> 00:29:40.239
<i>it was nicknames.</i>

541
00:29:41.907 --> 00:29:44.701
<i>Freddie was known
as Broadway Freddie.</i>

542
00:29:44.701 --> 00:29:47.287
<i>a relic from his
alleged racing days.</i>

543
00:29:47.287 --> 00:29:49.039
Hey!

544
00:29:49.039 --> 00:29:50.958
Hey. boys. What up?

545
00:29:50.958 --> 00:29:52.835
A fucking grease monkey.
Look at his broad.

546
00:29:52.835 --> 00:29:54.461
- She's got a fat fucking ass.

547
00:29:54.461 --> 00:29:56.088
You like it. kid?

548
00:29:56.088 --> 00:29:58.549
Oh. man.

549
00:29:58.549 --> 00:30:00.717
Very much.

550
00:30:00.717 --> 00:30:03.720
<i>- Te amo.</i>
- Too much. Too much.

551
00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.472
Hey. you know
anything about cars. kid?

552
00:30:05.472 --> 00:30:07.140
Aside from driving them.
not much.

553
00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:09.184
I mean. I know how
to change a flat tire.

554
00:30:09.184 --> 00:30:10.644
Freddie here's going
to teach you a lot more

555
00:30:10.644 --> 00:30:12.271
than how to change
a fucking flat.

556
00:30:12.271 --> 00:30:15.274
So I guess you never
boosted a car then. huh?

557
00:30:15.274 --> 00:30:17.901
- You guessed right.
- Yeah.

558
00:30:17.901 --> 00:30:20.195
Why don't you take this
screwdriver and follow me?

559
00:30:20.195 --> 00:30:21.446
All right.

560
00:30:26.493 --> 00:30:28.871
First things first.
jam it in the ignition

561
00:30:28.871 --> 00:30:30.998
and fucking smack
it like your old lady.

562
00:30:30.998 --> 00:30:32.207
Hey.

563
00:30:38.046 --> 00:30:39.965
All right. good.
Now start her up.

564
00:30:44.261 --> 00:30:46.388
He's got performance anxiety.

565
00:30:46.388 --> 00:30:48.765
Fuck.

566
00:30:48.765 --> 00:30:50.601
It's your first time.

567
00:30:50.601 --> 00:30:52.519
It happens. kid.

568
00:30:56.398 --> 00:30:57.900
This here is plan B.

569
00:31:00.402 --> 00:31:03.614
Cut those two wires in there.

570
00:31:03.614 --> 00:31:05.908
And fucking tie them together.
Yep. Those two.

571
00:31:05.908 --> 00:31:09.244
All right. good. Now cut those
two fucking wires. Those two.

572
00:31:09.244 --> 00:31:11.121
Don't fucking touch them.

573
00:31:11.121 --> 00:31:14.166
Good. now make them kiss.

574
00:31:17.961 --> 00:31:19.254
Yeah!

575
00:31:19.254 --> 00:31:21.006
All right. all right. all right.

576
00:31:21.006 --> 00:31:23.759
Fuckin' boy is a natural.
Look at that. Told you.

577
00:31:23.759 --> 00:31:25.844
<i>I hate to admit it. but.</i>

578
00:31:25.844 --> 00:31:29.932
<i>I kind of felt pretty
goddamn proud of myself.</i>

579
00:31:29.932 --> 00:31:33.352
<i>These guys would steal eight.
even ten cars a day.</i>

580
00:31:33.352 --> 00:31:35.187
<i>And no shit boxes. either.</i>

581
00:31:35.187 --> 00:31:38.482
<i>These had to be top
of the line vehicles.</i>

582
00:32:03.048 --> 00:32:04.800
<i>I always wanted a Corvette.</i>

583
00:32:07.553 --> 00:32:10.722
<i>It killed me to even put
a fucking scratch
on that thing.</i>

584
00:32:18.647 --> 00:32:20.732
Whoa. whoa. whoa. Mick.
Mick. get over here!

585
00:32:20.732 --> 00:32:22.943
Fuckin' Bobby.
already gonna fuck up.

586
00:32:24.361 --> 00:32:27.656
Hey. get out of the car.
get outta the car.

587
00:32:27.656 --> 00:32:29.032
<i>This wasn't good.</i>

588
00:32:29.032 --> 00:32:30.450
<i>I felt like he just caught me</i>

589
00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:32.077
<i>with my dick in his wife.</i>

590
00:32:32.077 --> 00:32:34.079
This is Tony's car. right?

591
00:32:34.079 --> 00:32:35.539
Who the fuck is Tony?

592
00:32:35.539 --> 00:32:37.165
Should we go get him?

593
00:32:37.165 --> 00:32:39.376
Hold it. This guy.
he's got it. he's got it.

594
00:32:39.376 --> 00:32:41.170
Keep speaking. Tony.
What do you talk--

595
00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:43.463
Tony's the fucking guy
told me to take the--

596
00:32:46.383 --> 00:32:49.386
Is he out of his fuckin' mind?

597
00:32:49.386 --> 00:32:53.265
You're a rat. Yeah you are.
You fuckin' rat!

598
00:32:53.265 --> 00:32:57.019
Come on you fuckin' pussies!
Huh. c'mon!

599
00:32:57.019 --> 00:32:59.605
-  Fuck you!
-  Oh yeah. fuck me!

600
00:32:59.605 --> 00:33:01.732
Fuckin' say something motherfuckers.

601
00:33:01.732 --> 00:33:03.192
I'll fuck you up right now.

602
00:33:03.192 --> 00:33:04.985
<i>I hadn't felt that good</i>

603
00:33:04.985 --> 00:33:06.945
<i>since my team made
the finals in Little League.</i>

604
00:33:09.823 --> 00:33:12.284
Now we're going to get
in fucking trouble
because of you.

605
00:33:12.284 --> 00:33:16.038
<i>And that's exactly
how this felt. Like a team.</i>

606
00:33:16.038 --> 00:33:18.790
You couldn't get a fucking
Lincoln or a Cadillac.
somethin' fuckin' nice?

607
00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:21.376
A fuckin' Lincoln?
Hey. this car's a beauty!

608
00:33:21.376 --> 00:33:24.505
Finally. someone with some
fucking taste around here.

609
00:33:24.505 --> 00:33:28.217
Oooh. all right!

610
00:33:28.217 --> 00:33:30.177
That was the first of many.

611
00:33:30.177 --> 00:33:32.763
Roy's going to be real happy.
Believe that.

612
00:33:32.763 --> 00:33:35.432
<i>That was the first time
any of them mentioned Roy.</i>

613
00:33:35.432 --> 00:33:37.601
- Those Irish pricks make you?
-  Make them?

614
00:33:37.601 --> 00:33:39.019
They didn't know
what fucking hit 'em.

615
00:33:39.019 --> 00:33:40.604
Yeah. was it anybody we know?

616
00:33:40.604 --> 00:33:42.272
Fucking tourists. I don't know.

617
00:33:42.272 --> 00:33:44.358
It's DeBono. right?

618
00:33:44.358 --> 00:33:46.944
- What?
- Your name?

619
00:33:46.944 --> 00:33:49.821
- Oh. yeah.
- Bobby Bones.

620
00:33:49.821 --> 00:33:52.407
- Bobby Bones.
- I like it. Bobby Bones.

621
00:33:52.407 --> 00:33:55.118
- Bones.
- Bobby fucking Bones. I like it.

622
00:33:55.118 --> 00:33:57.204
<i>Mobsters and their nicknames.</i>

623
00:33:57.204 --> 00:33:58.622
- Here's to the Irish.

624
00:33:58.622 --> 00:34:01.416
Hello?

625
00:34:01.416 --> 00:34:03.585
I got it.

626
00:34:03.585 --> 00:34:06.672
Boys. Time to go.

627
00:34:06.672 --> 00:34:07.965
Now.

628
00:34:13.053 --> 00:34:14.721
Where they goin'?

629
00:34:14.721 --> 00:34:17.349
We're gonna go next door.

630
00:34:20.185 --> 00:34:21.979
<i>Next door to
the Gemini Lounge was</i>

631
00:34:21.979 --> 00:34:24.022
<i>an apartment where
the gang would get together.</i>

632
00:34:27.568 --> 00:34:28.986
<i>There he was.</i>

633
00:34:32.364 --> 00:34:33.615
<i>Roy DeMeo.</i>

634
00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:38.453
<i>The air got thicker
the closer I got to him.</i>

635
00:34:51.717 --> 00:34:52.718
Sit down.

636
00:34:57.389 --> 00:34:59.725
Heard you've been
doing a good job.

637
00:34:59.725 --> 00:35:00.934
He's been doing great.

638
00:35:04.146 --> 00:35:06.690
<i>I started to sweat
and suddenly was very</i>

639
00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:09.026
<i>aware of that goddamn wire.</i>

640
00:35:09.026 --> 00:35:11.278
You having a good time
with my guys?

641
00:35:11.278 --> 00:35:14.031
Oh. yeah. I mean.
great bunch of guys.

642
00:35:16.033 --> 00:35:19.203
You know. I was a butcher's
apprentice when I was a kid.

643
00:35:19.203 --> 00:35:21.455
He's the one who taught me

644
00:35:21.455 --> 00:35:24.041
between a good piece
of meat and a bad one.

645
00:35:25.709 --> 00:35:28.462
How to cut through
the joints. not the bones.

646
00:35:30.589 --> 00:35:33.509
You know. Muslims and Jews.
they don't eat pork.

647
00:35:33.509 --> 00:35:35.177
You knew that. right?

648
00:35:35.177 --> 00:35:37.930
They think it's a dirty animal

649
00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:39.932
because they roll around
in their shit.

650
00:35:39.932 --> 00:35:42.893
Even fuck in their shit.

651
00:35:42.893 --> 00:35:46.355
They're considered
the dirtiest of the dirty.

652
00:35:46.355 --> 00:35:49.024
The pig. not the Muslims
and Jews.

653
00:35:52.277 --> 00:35:53.904
You bring me a pig.

654
00:35:55.405 --> 00:35:58.534
And I cut him up
with absolute pleasure.

655
00:35:58.534 --> 00:36:01.828
I mean. nothing I love
more than a dead pig

656
00:36:01.828 --> 00:36:02.955
at the end of my knife.

657
00:36:07.543 --> 00:36:08.544
You know why?

658
00:36:13.549 --> 00:36:15.092
Because I'm fucking Catholic.

659
00:36:23.433 --> 00:36:25.102
Fuckin' with you.

660
00:36:25.102 --> 00:36:27.229
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

661
00:36:27.229 --> 00:36:31.191
All right. We're gonna eat.
Chris. put this in the freezer.

662
00:36:31.191 --> 00:36:32.901
Keeping an eye on you. Bobby.

663
00:36:32.901 --> 00:36:34.945
I'm hearing good things.

664
00:36:34.945 --> 00:36:38.657
<i>Roy fucking DeMeo
liked what he saw.</i>

665
00:36:38.657 --> 00:36:41.660
<i>I was floored.</i>

666
00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:45.747
<i>I had dinner with them
that night like
we were old college buddies.</i>

667
00:36:48.458 --> 00:36:51.170
<i>I wouldn't see Roy for
almost a month after that.</i>

668
00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:53.172
<i>but what I got from him
and the crew that night</i>

669
00:36:53.172 --> 00:36:55.883
<i>set up a pretty solid
foundation for our case.</i>

670
00:36:57.509 --> 00:36:59.720
That was a fucking crazy day.

671
00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:01.138
It's the life. I'm tellin' you.

672
00:37:01.138 --> 00:37:02.723
Roy's a fucking good guy. too.

673
00:37:02.723 --> 00:37:05.142
- I mean. he's cool.
- Yeah. he's something.

674
00:37:05.142 --> 00:37:07.060
Yeah.

675
00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:11.148
Here's for that first impression
you wanted. you did good.

676
00:37:11.148 --> 00:37:13.942
<i>That was more cash
than I made in a month.</i>

677
00:37:13.942 --> 00:37:16.486
All right.
I'll see you tomorrow.

678
00:37:16.486 --> 00:37:18.238
Sweet dreams. Bobby.

679
00:37:37.174 --> 00:37:38.884
That was fucking crazy.

680
00:37:41.053 --> 00:37:42.763
What happened in that apartment?

681
00:37:49.895 --> 00:37:51.980
We're gonna need more film.

682
00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:53.899
We're going to need
a bigger board.

683
00:38:01.448 --> 00:38:03.951
<i>The next few weeks
felt like work.</i>

684
00:38:03.951 --> 00:38:05.702
<i>Hard work.</i>

685
00:38:05.702 --> 00:38:08.163
<i>We were hitting Roy's
quota of ten cars a day.</i>

686
00:38:08.163 --> 00:38:11.291
<i>and I was quickly
becoming an expert.</i>

687
00:38:17.381 --> 00:38:19.007
<i>One of their biggest operations</i>

688
00:38:19.007 --> 00:38:23.136
<i>was shipping luxury cars
off to Kuwait.</i>

689
00:38:23.136 --> 00:38:25.973
<i>I mean. everybody was paid off.</i>

690
00:38:37.317 --> 00:38:46.702
<i>♪ We're going out
We're gonna kill it again ♪</i>

691
00:38:46.702 --> 00:38:49.621

And again and again ♪</i>

692
00:38:54.251 --> 00:38:56.545
Jesus. Motherfucker!

693
00:38:56.545 --> 00:38:58.505
I didn't hear you coming. man.

694
00:38:58.505 --> 00:39:01.592
- We heard you coming.
- Yeah. I know. I know.
it's been.

695
00:39:01.592 --> 00:39:03.302
it's been a rough week.

696
00:39:03.302 --> 00:39:04.887
Mother in law has been
living with us.

697
00:39:06.763 --> 00:39:07.764
Say no more.

698
00:39:10.684 --> 00:39:13.020
All right. we'll tell
Roy you said hi.

699
00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:15.564
<i>They hustled porn
and any other sleazy thing</i>

700
00:39:15.564 --> 00:39:18.150
<i>you can think of.</i>

701
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:22.905
<i>And a few things you wish
you never knew existed.</i>

702
00:39:22.905 --> 00:39:26.867
<i>♪ We're going out
We're gonna kill it again ♪</i>

703
00:39:26.867 --> 00:39:30.454
<i>I spent most of my time
with Chris. driving mostly.</i>

704
00:39:30.454 --> 00:39:33.290
<i>But when he was high.
he had a pretty big mouth.</i>

705
00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:35.167
<i>and he was high all the time.</i>

706
00:39:35.167 --> 00:39:37.669
Meeting in an alley like
a bunch of fucking amateurs.

707
00:39:39.713 --> 00:39:42.382
That's why I don't do business
with junkies.

708
00:39:42.382 --> 00:39:44.885
<i>We go from nickels
and dimes to full keys.</i>

709
00:39:44.885 --> 00:39:47.221
<i>And there was no shortage
of customers.</i>

710
00:39:47.221 --> 00:39:49.389
Yo. How you doing. Chris?

711
00:39:49.389 --> 00:39:51.475
I'm all right. I'm all right.
Hey. how are we doing?

712
00:39:51.475 --> 00:39:53.143
- This is Deb.
-  There she is.

713
00:39:53.143 --> 00:39:55.103
- This is Roxanne.
- How are you doing. Roxanne?

714
00:39:55.103 --> 00:39:58.065
-  The fuck's your name?
- Jennifer.

715
00:39:58.065 --> 00:40:00.317
- That's fucking
Jennifer. I guess.
- It's Jennifer. Chris.

716
00:40:00.317 --> 00:40:02.319
This is my boy Bobby. Pleasure
make your acquaintance.

717
00:40:02.319 --> 00:40:05.030
Yo. yo. yo. did you hear
I had a fucking heart attack.

718
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:07.533
- For real?
- Dude. I woke up.
I fucking had a heart attack.

719
00:40:07.533 --> 00:40:09.117
My heart's pounding
like this. I don't know

720
00:40:09.117 --> 00:40:10.327
what the fuck's going on.

721
00:40:10.327 --> 00:40:11.828
My dick's not getting hard.

722
00:40:11.828 --> 00:40:13.455
I'm like. what the fuck?

723
00:40:13.455 --> 00:40:15.374
Next thing you know.
swear to God. I woke up.

724
00:40:15.374 --> 00:40:17.584
Scary shit. you're like
30 years old. What the hell.

725
00:40:17.584 --> 00:40:19.044
- how the fuck is that possible?
- Was it the coke?

726
00:40:19.044 --> 00:40:20.212
I don't think
it's the coke. man.

727
00:40:20.212 --> 00:40:21.964
It's not my fucking coke.

728
00:40:21.964 --> 00:40:23.590
If you had a heart attack.
'cause you're buying coke.

729
00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:25.467
you're fucking buying coke
from somebody else.

730
00:40:25.467 --> 00:40:27.219
You know I'd never buy coke

731
00:40:27.219 --> 00:40:29.429
from anyone else. motherfucker.
I just want to tell you...

732
00:40:29.429 --> 00:40:32.266
<i>That fucking hero cop
was back in my head.</i>

733
00:40:32.266 --> 00:40:36.228
<i>He told me girls
can sniff out bullshit.</i>

734
00:40:36.228 --> 00:40:38.689
I'll take it. man.
this is some good shit.

735
00:40:38.689 --> 00:40:42.526
What else would
I bring you. Come on.

736
00:40:42.526 --> 00:40:44.736
Hey. your girl all right.

737
00:40:44.736 --> 00:40:47.573
She's kind of having
a little bit of
a staring contest with me. huh?

738
00:40:49.032 --> 00:40:51.535
Maybe she likes you. Bobby.

739
00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:56.748
Give me the dough.
Give me the fucking dough.

740
00:40:56.748 --> 00:40:58.250
Hey. I don't like this

741
00:40:58.250 --> 00:41:00.294
What don't you like?

742
00:41:00.294 --> 00:41:02.796
- I don't like him.
- She doesn't like him.

743
00:41:02.796 --> 00:41:05.966
Oh. you don't like me?
You know what?
I don't fucking like you.

744
00:41:05.966 --> 00:41:07.718
- Hey-hey-hey.
- You don't have to like him.

745
00:41:07.718 --> 00:41:09.595
Where'd he find you?

746
00:41:09.595 --> 00:41:12.222
Give me the fucking money.
Ronny. Sick of this bullshit.

747
00:41:12.222 --> 00:41:13.682
Disrespectful women. God damn.

748
00:41:13.682 --> 00:41:15.058
Sorry.

749
00:41:15.058 --> 00:41:17.352
- Fuck you!
- Get the fuck outta here.

750
00:41:17.352 --> 00:41:20.147
<i>After a while. I started
to get a bit worried.</i>

751
00:41:20.147 --> 00:41:22.441
<i>Not that I'd blow
my cover or anything.</i>

752
00:41:22.441 --> 00:41:25.819
<i>but I actually
started having fun.</i>

753
00:41:25.819 --> 00:41:28.113
Your own fucking house!

754
00:41:28.113 --> 00:41:31.200
It'll be the last time
I see your face here
this month. Garo.

755
00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:32.951
What the hell do
you want me to say?

756
00:41:32.951 --> 00:41:34.995
It's an old building.
It's going to have problems.

757
00:41:34.995 --> 00:41:36.496
Oh. is that what
you want me to tell Roy?

758
00:41:36.496 --> 00:41:38.123
That the building's
got problems?

759
00:41:38.123 --> 00:41:39.875
You don't have to
tell him anything.

760
00:41:39.875 --> 00:41:42.419
- I'm going to fix it.
- Oh. you'll fix it. huh?

761
00:41:42.419 --> 00:41:45.589
<i>Place was falling apart.
That's Garo. the landlord.</i>

762
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:48.467
<i>He was always trying to fix
the plumbing and failing.</i>

763
00:41:48.467 --> 00:41:50.594
Oh. you'll fix it. hon.

764
00:41:50.594 --> 00:41:54.848
No more problems.
but no more rent. You got it?

765
00:41:54.848 --> 00:41:57.434
- Yeah.
-  <i>Gina held her own.</i>

766
00:41:57.434 --> 00:42:00.145
<i>I was impressed. but more than</i>

767
00:42:00.145 --> 00:42:02.606
<i>a little messed up. so I needed
to get my head straight.</i>

768
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:08.904
- Hey.
- Jesus. Bobby. You scared me.

769
00:42:08.904 --> 00:42:10.989
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.

770
00:42:10.989 --> 00:42:12.950
How did you know
I was going to be here?

771
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:15.577
I'm a detective. remember?

772
00:42:15.577 --> 00:42:17.496
No. you know. it's Monday.

773
00:42:17.496 --> 00:42:20.040
I figured. you know. I know
you like to shop on Mondays.

774
00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:21.959
There's less crowds.
so I figured I'd drop by

775
00:42:21.959 --> 00:42:24.586
and see if you still did.
I'm sorry.

776
00:42:27.047 --> 00:42:30.342
Hey. No. I got it.
I got it. I got it.

777
00:42:30.342 --> 00:42:34.137
I want you to know
how sorry I am.
You know. I mean.

778
00:42:34.137 --> 00:42:37.474
I want you to know that...

779
00:42:37.474 --> 00:42:41.019
showing up at your door
like that the other day and.

780
00:42:41.019 --> 00:42:42.729
let's call
a spade of spade. right?

781
00:42:42.729 --> 00:42:45.607
I've been a miserable bastard.
I'm embarrassed.

782
00:42:45.607 --> 00:42:47.901
And I'm sorry that
I haven't been by.

783
00:42:47.901 --> 00:42:49.695
but I got something
going on with work.

784
00:42:49.695 --> 00:42:51.071
- You know. I mean.
- Oh. yeah.

785
00:42:51.071 --> 00:42:53.407
it's top secret. but no.

786
00:42:53.407 --> 00:42:55.659
it's one of the biggest things
of my career.

787
00:42:55.659 --> 00:42:58.370
I just wanted to let you know.

788
00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:01.498
- Bobby. I have to go. I'm sorry.
- Listen. listen.
you don't have to go.

789
00:43:01.498 --> 00:43:03.542
Just talk to me for two seconds.

790
00:43:03.542 --> 00:43:05.335
I want to go.

- Just two goddamn seconds.
Come on.

- Hey. are you okay. miss?
- She's fine. Okay?

793
00:43:09.756 --> 00:43:11.258
Listen. pal.

794
00:43:11.258 --> 00:43:13.051
like I'm going to call the cops.

795
00:43:13.051 --> 00:43:14.970
Yeah. call your mother. asshole.

Okay. listen. Mary. please.

797

Lady does not want to hear
what you have to say.

Just. just let me hear what--
Just-- Mary!

801
00:43:41.079 --> 00:43:45.042
- You okay?
- Yeah. I just gotta
stay focused.

802
00:43:45.042 --> 00:43:48.212
I hate dealing with this
fucking piece of shit.

803
00:43:48.212 --> 00:43:50.547
Oh. Oh. Bobby. Hey.

804
00:43:50.547 --> 00:43:52.216
The fuck are you doing?

805

Bobby. relax.
You're doing a good job.

806
00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:58.263
Good? We don't have
jack fucking shit yet.

00:43:58.263 --> 00:44:00.474
I mean. this is fucking
taking too long.

808
00:44:00.474 --> 00:44:02.768
Man. these guys are
going to fucking bury me.

809
00:44:02.768 --> 00:44:04.394
You fucking crazy?

810
00:44:04.394 --> 00:44:06.480
You got rolls and rolls
of this shit.

811
00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:09.483
Look. just get DeMeo
to say he pulls the strings

812
00:44:09.483 --> 00:44:10.692
and we go home.

813
00:44:10.692 --> 00:44:13.529
All right. relax.

814
00:44:13.529 --> 00:44:16.615
- Calm down.
- Yeah. Yeah.

815
00:44:20.118 --> 00:44:21.453
You read my mind.

816
00:44:24.289 --> 00:44:26.792
- Where is everybody?
- Out.

817

<i>Nino Gaggi in the flesh.</i>

Thank you.

833

All right. well.
just keep your head down.

834
00:45:12.296 --> 00:45:14.381
your ears pricked. and mm-hmm.

835
00:45:14.381 --> 00:45:16.758
You keep coming with the "sirs."
you could do very good.

836
00:45:16.758 --> 00:45:19.011
-  <i>Nino smiled a lot.</i>
- Welcome.

837
00:45:19.011 --> 00:45:20.804
<i>Which almost made you
forget that he was</i>

00:45:20.804 --> 00:45:22.723
<i>a fucking stone cold killer.</i>

839
00:45:22.723 --> 00:45:25.100

Bobby. come with me. Joseph.
let me know when the guys come.

841
00:45:28.312 --> 00:45:30.272
And close the fucking door.
There's a breeze in here.

842
00:45:30.272 --> 00:45:32.065
I told you a million
fucking times.

<i>This was one of them.</i>

846
00:45:59.676 --> 00:46:03.138
Did you. uh.
did you ever do any time?

847
00:46:03.138 --> 00:46:04.556
No.

848
00:46:06.058 --> 00:46:07.559
You know that guy
you guys beat up?

849
00:46:07.559 --> 00:46:08.685
- You and Chris?
- Yeah.

850
00:46:08.685 --> 00:46:10.395
He's in the hospital.

851
00:46:10.395 --> 00:46:12.356
He's not talking right now
because he can't talk.

852
00:46:13.065 --> 00:46:14.107
Yeah.

853
00:46:14.107 --> 00:46:16.818
But when he gets out.

854
00:46:16.818 --> 00:46:18.362
you might have a problem.

855
00:46:18.362 --> 00:46:20.822
Yeah. Honestly.
I didn't mean to...

856
00:46:28.497 --> 00:46:29.665
Did you ever kill anybody?

857
00:46:35.337 --> 00:46:39.424
<i>It wasn't because
he scared me or intimidated me.</i>

858
00:46:39.424 --> 00:46:43.554
<i>But there was something
about him. something familiar.</i>

859
00:46:43.554 --> 00:46:46.056
<i>So I did something that
I never thought I'd do</i>

860
00:46:46.056 --> 00:46:50.269
<i>when asked
that specific question.
I told the truth.</i>

861
00:46:50.269 --> 00:46:51.478
Yes.

862
00:46:51.478 --> 00:46:53.063
How many?

863
00:46:55.858 --> 00:46:57.025
Just one.

864
00:46:57.025 --> 00:46:58.694
What happened?

865
00:47:02.948 --> 00:47:05.450
He was trying to kill me.

866
00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:08.495
Why was he trying to kill you?

867
00:47:08.495 --> 00:47:10.581
He was disrespecting my sister.

868
00:47:10.581 --> 00:47:14.585
So I clocked him in front
of the other kids.

869
00:47:14.585 --> 00:47:20.007
He was a bigger kid
and he chased me onto the roof.

870
00:47:20.007 --> 00:47:25.304
And we were struggling. but.

871
00:47:25.304 --> 00:47:31.185
there's that moment. you know.
where you make a choice
and I just...

872
00:47:31.185 --> 00:47:33.478
threw him off the fucking roof.

873
00:47:35.898 --> 00:47:38.692
And they call it a suicide.

874
00:47:40.903 --> 00:47:43.071
I. uh.

875
00:47:43.071 --> 00:47:46.033
I never told that
to anybody before.

876
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:52.664
So you did it...

877
00:47:52.664 --> 00:47:55.584
to honor your sister.
did she know
what you did for her?

878
00:47:55.584 --> 00:48:01.715
She didn't say much about it.
You know. she was. uh...
she was dead.

879
00:48:01.715 --> 00:48:07.471
She. uh. she killed herself
earlier that summer. so...

880
00:48:07.471 --> 00:48:09.765
Kid was just mouthing off
about my dead sister

881
00:48:09.765 --> 00:48:12.893
and I couldn't let it slide.

882
00:48:12.893 --> 00:48:14.353
How old were you?

883
00:48:15.854 --> 00:48:17.689
Sixteen.

884
00:48:17.689 --> 00:48:19.107
Stupid.

885
00:48:25.072 --> 00:48:26.281
What did it feel like?

886
00:48:30.285 --> 00:48:32.329
Didn't feel like anything.

887
00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:41.421
Hello?

888
00:48:43.048 --> 00:48:44.383
Okay.

889
00:48:49.304 --> 00:48:52.266
Come with me. Come on.

890
00:48:52.266 --> 00:48:53.976
<i>Something was up.</i>

891
00:48:53.976 --> 00:48:56.395
<i>For a second. I thought
Roy made me for sure.</i>

892
00:48:56.395 --> 00:48:57.646
Come on.

893
00:49:00.274 --> 00:49:03.110
<i>He was eyeing me
like a hawk back there.</i>

894
00:49:09.491 --> 00:49:12.619
Guys. come with me.
I'll call you later. Chris.

895
00:49:12.619 --> 00:49:15.038
- Yeah.
- Come on. Come on. come on.

896
00:49:15.038 --> 00:49:18.333
<i>Whatever was going down
was going down soon.</i>

897
00:49:18.333 --> 00:49:20.502
<i>And by the look
on Chris's face.</i>

898
00:49:20.502 --> 00:49:22.129
<i>it was going
to be something big.</i>

899
00:49:22.129 --> 00:49:24.047
- Ah.
- What's up?

900
00:49:24.047 --> 00:49:27.926
- We got to wait.
- For what?

901
00:49:27.926 --> 00:49:29.636
For the guys to get back.

902
00:49:31.763 --> 00:49:33.265
Come with me.

903
00:49:33.265 --> 00:49:34.766
I wanna pick your brain
about something.

904
00:49:37.352 --> 00:49:41.190
Hey. what's up?

905
00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:45.444
Ever since Roy got made.
things have been uh. different.

906
00:49:45.444 --> 00:49:47.696
You know. Paul treats him
like a prince on account of

907
00:49:47.696 --> 00:49:49.907
the Westies deal
with the rest of us...

908
00:49:49.907 --> 00:49:51.867
we're basically slinging shit.

909
00:49:51.867 --> 00:49:54.161
<i>Let me fill you in
on what he's talking about.</i>

910
00:49:54.161 --> 00:49:56.538
<i>DeMeo had a hard time
getting made.</i>

911
00:49:56.538 --> 00:50:00.250
<i>But when he helped
put the Irish mob.
also known as the Westies.</i>

912
00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:02.127
<i>in bed with the Gambinos.</i>

913
00:50:02.127 --> 00:50:03.754
<i>Paul Castellano
was tickled pink</i>

914
00:50:03.754 --> 00:50:05.923
<i>and decided it was time.</i>

915
00:50:05.923 --> 00:50:08.467
Now. sometimes we do things
we ain't supposed to do

916
00:50:08.467 --> 00:50:11.720
and Roy. God bless him.
he turns a blind eye.

917
00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:13.764
And sometimes you get
the chance to cut yourself

918
00:50:13.764 --> 00:50:17.142
a bigger piece of the pie.

919
00:50:17.142 --> 00:50:20.979
But this time. we're goin'
for a bigger fucking pie.

920
00:50:20.979 --> 00:50:23.190
Well. how much bigger?

921
00:50:24.399 --> 00:50:26.527
I got a guy down in Florida.

922
00:50:26.527 --> 00:50:27.903
And it stays between us. right?

923
00:50:27.903 --> 00:50:29.363
Yeah. of course.

924
00:50:32.741 --> 00:50:35.786
- Colombians.
- Colombians?

925
00:50:35.786 --> 00:50:37.496
They're bringing
some grade-A shit.

926
00:50:37.496 --> 00:50:39.331
Like actual fucking coke.

927
00:50:39.331 --> 00:50:41.083
Not the bullshit
that we're dealing.

928
00:50:41.083 --> 00:50:42.918
And you're not telling Roy?

929
00:50:42.918 --> 00:50:45.546
I'm not telling anybody.

930
00:50:45.546 --> 00:50:48.173
So what do you think?

931
00:50:48.173 --> 00:50:49.883
I mean. what's the problem?

932
00:50:52.094 --> 00:50:54.805
They're bringing a lot
of fucking powder. Bobby.

933
00:50:54.805 --> 00:50:58.225
More than I can move on my own
comfortably. I got to admit.

934
00:50:58.225 --> 00:51:00.185
So. I was thinkin'.

935
00:51:00.185 --> 00:51:02.855
I'll bring you in.
We could share it.

936
00:51:05.065 --> 00:51:07.776
Man. ah...

937
00:51:07.776 --> 00:51:10.529
I mean. I don't know. Chris.
I mean...

938
00:51:10.529 --> 00:51:12.906
I don't know if I'm ready
for something like that.

939
00:51:16.159 --> 00:51:20.247
Yeah. okay.
Yeah. you're not ready.
you're not ready.

940
00:51:20.247 --> 00:51:22.624
It's all good.
What am I going to do. right?

941
00:51:24.877 --> 00:51:26.920
I thought you'd be
more excited about this.

942
00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:30.465
I thought you'd jump at it.
But I guess I was wrong.

943
00:51:30.465 --> 00:51:32.467
Mum better be the fucking word.
though. right?

944
00:51:32.467 --> 00:51:35.512
Mum's my favorite
fucking word. Come on.

945
00:51:35.512 --> 00:51:38.974
All right. good.

946
00:51:38.974 --> 00:51:41.518
Let's get out of here.

947
00:51:41.518 --> 00:51:43.520
<i>No fucking way.</i>

948
00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:45.314
<i>Chris could have made a deal
with the Russians.</i>

949
00:51:45.314 --> 00:51:48.108
<i>for all I cared.
I was after Roy.</i>

950
00:51:48.108 --> 00:51:50.235
All right. Roy.
I'll see you later.

951
00:51:55.115 --> 00:51:58.368
Bobby. Front seat.

952
00:51:58.368 --> 00:52:00.370
<i>One of the things
I learned quick was that</i>

953
00:52:00.370 --> 00:52:02.039
<i>sitting in the passenger seat</i>

954
00:52:02.039 --> 00:52:04.291
<i>with a maniac
in the backseat behind you</i>

955
00:52:04.291 --> 00:52:07.753
<i>was the worst possible position
to be in during a road trip.</i>

956
00:52:22.559 --> 00:52:24.436
<i>We were headed out of the city.</i>

957
00:52:24.436 --> 00:52:26.605
<i>James was going to have
to sit this one out.</i>

958
00:52:26.605 --> 00:52:29.858
<i>or we were going
to get made for sure.</i>

959
00:52:35.364 --> 00:52:38.742
No. I don't
know what's going on. but...

960
00:52:38.742 --> 00:52:40.160
I know.

961
00:52:44.873 --> 00:52:46.208
Come here.

962
00:52:49.837 --> 00:52:50.838
Open the trunk.

963
00:52:58.679 --> 00:53:00.430
Remember him?

964
00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:02.391
<i>It was the guy
I fucked up that night</i>

965
00:53:02.391 --> 00:53:04.351
<i>with Chris in the bathroom.</i>

966
00:53:04.351 --> 00:53:07.437
<i>If there was one thing
Roy would not tolerate.</i>

967
00:53:07.437 --> 00:53:09.773
<i>it was loose ends.</i>

968
00:53:09.773 --> 00:53:14.528
<i>Everything is so clear
when you look back at it.</i>

969
00:53:14.528 --> 00:53:17.030
<i>I should have killed them
all right then and there.</i>

970
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:19.283
<i>But in situations like this.</i>

971
00:53:19.283 --> 00:53:23.412
<i>instead of doing
what you should do.</i>

972
00:53:23.412 --> 00:53:25.789
<i>you do what you have to do.</i>

973
00:53:30.377 --> 00:53:32.129
<i>I remembered that kid
on the roof.</i>

974
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:35.924
<i>And I remembered my sister.</i>

975
00:53:37.217 --> 00:53:40.179
Freddy. close the trunk.
Let's go. Go.
Get back in the car.

976
00:53:40.179 --> 00:53:42.723
<i>And I felt nothing.</i>

977
00:53:42.723 --> 00:53:44.516
Go. back in the car.

978
00:53:49.313 --> 00:53:50.314
Let's go.

979
00:54:06.288 --> 00:54:07.414
<i>Remember him?</i>

980
00:54:50.290 --> 00:54:51.792
Where'd they take you?

981
00:54:51.792 --> 00:54:55.045
Oh. man. I don't
want to talk about it.

982
00:54:55.045 --> 00:54:56.255
What's that supposed to mean?

983
00:54:56.255 --> 00:54:57.798
Nothing.

984
00:54:57.798 --> 00:55:00.634
Give me. give me the tape.

985
00:55:00.634 --> 00:55:01.927
Just let it go. okay?

986
00:55:01.927 --> 00:55:03.428
Where the fuck is the tape?

987
00:55:03.428 --> 00:55:05.180
Just let it go. okay?

988
00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:06.598
You want me to call
the captain and tell them that

989
00:55:06.598 --> 00:55:08.267
you think I should
just let it go?

990
00:55:08.267 --> 00:55:10.185
We are going to get
everything we need to put

991
00:55:10.185 --> 00:55:11.895
these guys away for the rest
of their fucking lives. okay?

992
00:55:11.895 --> 00:55:15.524
But right now. you just
need to trust me. Okay?

993
00:55:15.524 --> 00:55:18.527
Just let it go.

994
00:55:18.527 --> 00:55:22.155
All right? Let it go.

995
00:55:32.708 --> 00:55:38.046
<i>I couldn't face her anymore.
Not until it was all over.</i>

996
00:55:38.046 --> 00:55:40.591
<i>Even just sitting here might be
putting her in danger.</i>

997
00:55:40.591 --> 00:55:42.426
<i>but I had to see her again.</i>

998
00:55:42.426 --> 00:55:45.846
<i>Her smile was the only thing
keeping me going.</i>

999
00:55:45.846 --> 00:55:47.806
<i>I had to find a way back to it.</i>

1000
00:56:07.701 --> 00:56:10.954
Hey. Mister Nice Guy.

1001
00:56:10.954 --> 00:56:15.375
Yeah. hey. um. is Chris here?

1002
00:56:15.375 --> 00:56:18.420
No. I haven't seen him
since yesterday.

1003
00:56:21.882 --> 00:56:23.800
What's with the long face?

1004
00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:25.677
It's. uh. it's nothin'

1005
00:56:25.677 --> 00:56:27.846
I know a lie when I hear one.

1006
00:56:29.515 --> 00:56:33.644
Well. girl trouble.

1007
00:56:33.644 --> 00:56:37.272
I knew it. Always is.

1008
00:56:37.272 --> 00:56:39.983
What. you think
it's that simple?

1009
00:56:39.983 --> 00:56:42.236
Yeah. I could have his legs
blown off and still not feel

1010
00:56:42.236 --> 00:56:44.196
as bad as when there's
girl trouble.

1011
00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:49.368
I'll let you be
in my ear for a bit.

1012
00:56:49.368 --> 00:56:51.870
Hey. Bobby. Let's go.

1013
00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:53.205
We're going for a drive.

1014
00:57:32.369 --> 00:57:35.038
<i>We were paying
Luca Santi visit.</i>

1015
00:57:35.038 --> 00:57:37.583
<i>His debt was ballooning.
and the twins were ordered to</i>

1016
00:57:37.583 --> 00:57:40.460
<i>give him what they called
a final warning.</i>

1017
00:57:56.226 --> 00:58:00.230
Get the fuck down. Sit down.

1018
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:03.483
Guys. come on.
calm down. please.

1019
00:58:03.483 --> 00:58:06.987
Listen. guys.
I had a good month.
A really good month.

1020
00:58:06.987 --> 00:58:08.906
A couple more months like this
and I'll have this. all--

1021
00:58:08.906 --> 00:58:10.240
Where's the fuckin' money?

1022
00:58:12.868 --> 00:58:15.787
I'm good for it. Roy knows this.

1023
00:58:15.787 --> 00:58:18.540
- Roy don't want your word.
- He wants his fucking money.

1024
00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:20.918
I know. Just give me a chance.
Give me a chance.

1025
00:58:20.918 --> 00:58:23.170
You could have three good months
and you're still going to be
fucking short.

1026
00:58:23.170 --> 00:58:25.672
- You understand that?
- Come on guys. please.

1027
00:58:25.672 --> 00:58:28.425
Put your hand on the book.

1028
00:58:28.425 --> 00:58:30.636
- Put your hand on the book.
- Come on. guys.

1029
00:58:30.636 --> 00:58:32.763
It doesn't have to be like this.
I'll take care of you.

1030
00:58:32.763 --> 00:58:34.765
Your hand. put it on
the fuckin' book!

1031
00:58:36.892 --> 00:58:40.395
Bobby. hold him down.
Bobby. get the fuck over there.

1032
00:58:40.395 --> 00:58:43.232
- Hold him the fuck down.
-  Come on.

1033
00:58:43.232 --> 00:58:46.109
Guys. give me a chance to
make this right. please.

1034
00:58:46.109 --> 00:58:51.615
Luca. it's your neck
or your fucking hand? Which one?
Hmm?

1035
00:58:51.615 --> 00:58:53.784
Listen. you got to understand.
you can come into the bar.

1036
00:58:53.784 --> 00:58:57.663
you can have a drink.
you can try to look up
Gina's skirt. okay?

1037
00:58:57.663 --> 00:58:59.206
But if you don't pay Roy.

1038
00:58:59.206 --> 00:59:01.375
I'm going to cut your
fucking tongue out

1039
00:59:01.375 --> 00:59:04.002
and I'm going to feed it
to that hooker you call
your fucking wife.

1040
00:59:04.002 --> 00:59:05.754
You understand?

1041
00:59:05.754 --> 00:59:06.964
Yes.

1042
00:59:06.964 --> 00:59:08.340
Good.

1043
00:59:25.858 --> 00:59:26.859
I'll see you next week. Luca.

1044
00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:33.532
<i>Nothing was phasing me anymore.</i>

1045
00:59:33.532 --> 00:59:36.743
<i>I mean. what was going on
in my fucking head?</i>

1046
00:59:39.454 --> 00:59:41.790
The fuck you doing?

1047
00:59:41.790 --> 00:59:44.543
You lost your fucking mind.

1048
00:59:44.543 --> 00:59:46.420
Huh? Have you?

1049
00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:48.172
If someone sees us.
we're fucking dead.

1050
00:59:48.172 --> 00:59:50.382
Yeah. you know what? I'm taking
the fucking night off.

1051
00:59:50.382 --> 00:59:53.343
Hey. Fuck.

1052
01:00:14.239 --> 01:00:16.283
- Hey.
- Hey.

1053
01:00:18.702 --> 01:00:23.916
Ooh. you're finally letting
your hair down. I like it.

1054
01:00:23.916 --> 01:00:27.252
- Roy in his office?
- No. it's his kid's
birthday today.

1055
01:00:27.252 --> 01:00:31.507
Oh. well. happy birthday.

1056
01:00:31.507 --> 01:00:33.425
What time do you get off?

1057
01:00:33.425 --> 01:00:35.177
You tell me.

1058
01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:50.859
<i>It wasn't
the best course of action. but...</i>

1059
01:00:50.859 --> 01:00:53.153
<i>it was pretty fucking good.</i>

1060
01:00:53.153 --> 01:00:58.867
<i>♪ We're gonna stay
In paradise ♪</i>

1061
01:00:58.867 --> 01:01:03.997
<i>♪ Lost in the waves
Lost in your eyes ♪</i>

1062
01:01:50.377 --> 01:01:54.965
My wife. she. uh. she left me.

1063
01:01:58.427 --> 01:01:59.928
You got any kids?

1064
01:01:59.928 --> 01:02:04.183
Nah. never got around to it.

1065
01:02:04.183 --> 01:02:07.269
That's a good thing. right?

1066
01:02:07.269 --> 01:02:11.231
Don't want any rugrats getting
mixed up in all that bullshit.

1067
01:02:11.231 --> 01:02:12.733
Yeah.

1068
01:02:14.359 --> 01:02:17.362
Hey. Roy has kids?

1069
01:02:17.362 --> 01:02:19.114
Yeah. three of them.

1070
01:02:19.114 --> 01:02:22.618
I just never took him
for a family man.

1071
01:02:22.618 --> 01:02:27.706
Mm. A lot of people don't.
But...

1072
01:02:27.706 --> 01:02:31.168
family is at the top
of Roy's priorities.

1073
01:02:31.168 --> 01:02:32.961
You know who he is. right?

1074
01:02:32.961 --> 01:02:34.588
I mean. you know what he does.

1075
01:02:37.049 --> 01:02:38.091
Sure.

1076
01:02:44.014 --> 01:02:45.265
And you're okay with it?

1077
01:02:53.774 --> 01:02:55.108
I gotta close up.

1078
01:02:57.069 --> 01:02:58.820
Thanks for the talk.

1079
01:03:06.370 --> 01:03:10.165
<i>I couldn't tell
if she was just a bartender
or in on everything.</i>

1080
01:03:10.165 --> 01:03:12.709
<i>All I knew was
that I was getting lost.</i>

1081
01:03:18.215 --> 01:03:19.967
Captain.

1082
01:03:19.967 --> 01:03:22.636
Wow. Yeah.

1083
01:03:22.636 --> 01:03:26.098
You've been real busy.
I see you guys are
really. really busy.

1084
01:03:26.098 --> 01:03:28.183
Yes. sir.

1085
01:03:28.183 --> 01:03:30.727
You know why I'm here
at two o'clock
in the fucking morning?

1086
01:03:30.727 --> 01:03:34.731
You think I came over to here
to have fucking coffee with you?

1087
01:03:34.731 --> 01:03:37.401
Let me tell you.
I got a call from Jim

1088
01:03:37.401 --> 01:03:41.530
and Jim is very
concerned about you.

1089
01:03:41.530 --> 01:03:43.031
I don't know what he told you.

1090
01:03:43.031 --> 01:03:45.158
okay. but everything
is under control.

1091
01:03:45.158 --> 01:03:47.160
Is it really under control?

1092
01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:49.288
- Is it really?
- Yeah.

1093
01:03:51.164 --> 01:03:55.127
Jim. tell him what you told me.

1094
01:03:55.127 --> 01:03:58.672
I said I'm worried
that you're getting too close.

1095
01:03:58.672 --> 01:04:00.716
Are you getting
too close. Bobby?

1096
01:04:00.716 --> 01:04:03.051
Yeah. I'm getting close.
I mean. how else are we going

1097
01:04:03.051 --> 01:04:04.803
to get these guys?
Across the street?

1098
01:04:04.803 --> 01:04:06.722
Too close to that world.

1099
01:04:06.722 --> 01:04:10.309
Bobby. Where the fuck
is your wire?

1100
01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:13.729
- Well. I already took it off.
- How are you going to get
a recording with this scumbag--

1101
01:04:13.729 --> 01:04:16.190
I was afraid they were
going to find it.

1102
01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:20.110
And then you tell Jimmy

1103
01:04:20.110 --> 01:04:22.654
that you're taking off tonight?

1104
01:04:22.654 --> 01:04:25.282
What? No. uh...
I don't. I don't.

1105
01:04:25.282 --> 01:04:27.659
I don't remember what I said.

1106
01:04:27.659 --> 01:04:30.329
<i>Taking the fucking night off.
Okay? Don't wait up.</i>

1107
01:04:30.329 --> 01:04:32.206
Listen to me.

1108
01:04:32.206 --> 01:04:34.458
Now. you stop this bullshit.

1109
01:04:34.458 --> 01:04:37.461
You get DeMeo on the tape
giving one order.

1110
01:04:37.461 --> 01:04:40.297
just one order we'll wrap
this whole place up.

1111
01:04:40.297 --> 01:04:42.591
Take all these pictures.
all these tapes

1112
01:04:42.591 --> 01:04:46.720
and all the files on my desk.
so I could present it
to the department.

1113
01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:48.347
You gotta understand something.

1114
01:04:48.347 --> 01:04:49.806
I'm telling you right now.

1115
01:04:49.806 --> 01:04:52.434
if I fucking have to
come back here.

1116
01:04:52.434 --> 01:04:54.394
I'm shutting this whole
fucking thing down.

1117
01:04:54.394 --> 01:04:56.647
I don't know what's going on
in your fucked up head.

1118
01:04:56.647 --> 01:05:00.400
but I don't like
the way you're acting.

1119
01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:03.612
I want you to watch this
fucking guy. okay? Please.

1120
01:05:06.156 --> 01:05:07.407
Okay?

1121
01:05:14.289 --> 01:05:17.835
It's getting late.
so I'm gonna go to bed.

1122
01:05:30.013 --> 01:05:31.849
That's not the knock.

1123
01:05:46.822 --> 01:05:47.823
Bobby?

1124
01:06:10.679 --> 01:06:12.347
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
keep it down. Okay?

1125
01:06:12.347 --> 01:06:14.183
Listen. my girl's
asleep in there.

1126
01:06:14.183 --> 01:06:17.102
I fucked up. Bobby.
I fucked up bad.

1127
01:06:17.102 --> 01:06:19.813
Calm down. Calm-calm down.
What happened?

1128
01:06:19.813 --> 01:06:21.940
I don't know. The deal
was going like clockwork.

1129
01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:23.150
I don't know what came over me.

1130
01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:26.195
<i>Fuck. The Colombians.</i>

1131
01:06:29.281 --> 01:06:32.492
<i>Not only did he kill
his Cuban contacts
from Florida.</i>

1132
01:06:32.492 --> 01:06:34.620
<i>but one of the dealers
he killed was related</i>

1133
01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:37.998
<i>to the head of a fucking
Colombian drug cartel.</i>

1134
01:06:37.998 --> 01:06:41.502
<i>His cousin.
And worst of all. the other one</i>

1135
01:06:41.502 --> 01:06:43.962
<i>was his goddamn girlfriend.</i>

1136
01:06:43.962 --> 01:06:46.048
<i>Chris killed everybody.</i>

1137
01:06:46.048 --> 01:06:49.051
Okay. All right?
Where are the bodies?

1138
01:06:49.051 --> 01:06:50.469
I called the guys.

1139
01:06:50.469 --> 01:06:51.720
I had to cut them in.

1140
01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:53.472
What are you doing here then?

1141
01:06:53.472 --> 01:06:55.807
I got to lay low for a while.

1142
01:06:55.807 --> 01:06:57.643
Here? Are you out of your mind?

1143
01:06:57.643 --> 01:06:59.102
They're fucking looking for me.

1144
01:06:59.102 --> 01:07:00.896
If they find me.
they'll fucking kill me.

1145
01:07:00.896 --> 01:07:03.065
<i>I was already looking
at a dead man.</i>

1146
01:07:03.065 --> 01:07:05.526
<i>but I was also
seeing an opportunity.</i>

1147
01:07:05.526 --> 01:07:06.818
Just go to Roy.

1148
01:07:08.904 --> 01:07:10.364
I can't do that.

1149
01:07:10.364 --> 01:07:12.491
Listen. maybe he can
make some calls.

1150
01:07:12.491 --> 01:07:15.452
Pull some fucking strings
for you. I'll go there
with you. Chris.

1151
01:07:15.452 --> 01:07:16.870
I gave them his name.

1152
01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:17.955
What?

1153
01:07:17.955 --> 01:07:19.373
I gave them his name.

1154
01:07:19.373 --> 01:07:20.874
I told him my name
was Chris DeMeo.

1155
01:07:20.874 --> 01:07:23.544
Chris fucking DeMeo.
I wasn't thinking.

1156
01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:29.842
Right. Let's go to Roy.

1157
01:07:33.595 --> 01:07:34.930
You don't know Roy.

1158
01:07:37.057 --> 01:07:39.434
Chris? Chris?

1159
01:07:41.103 --> 01:07:43.105
I'll fucking call you. Okay?

1160
01:07:49.194 --> 01:07:50.988
Hey. Give me the wire.

1161
01:08:00.664 --> 01:08:02.583
I know. What do
you want me to do?

1162
01:08:10.632 --> 01:08:12.301
Okay. everybody's here.

1163
01:08:12.301 --> 01:08:16.305
That's good.
One big happy family.

1164
01:08:16.305 --> 01:08:18.056
Except for one.

1165
01:08:22.311 --> 01:08:24.104
Look.

1166
01:08:24.104 --> 01:08:26.315
I want you to think real hard
about what you do

1167
01:08:26.315 --> 01:08:28.775
and say when I walk out of here.

1168
01:08:28.775 --> 01:08:30.402
Because Roy's going to tell me.

1169
01:08:30.402 --> 01:08:33.197
and I'm telling you.
I am promising you

1170
01:08:33.197 --> 01:08:36.116
that I have almost
no fucking fuse left.

1171
01:08:36.116 --> 01:08:39.161
Do you understand?
Huh. you understand?

1172
01:08:45.292 --> 01:08:47.753
You find this son of a bitch.
You understand? You find him.

1173
01:08:47.753 --> 01:08:50.297
- Yeah.
- Okay? I took you under my wing.

1174
01:08:50.297 --> 01:08:53.634
You go down for this.
we go down. Okay?

1175
01:08:53.634 --> 01:08:56.303
And there's only one
other way out of it. Okay?

1176
01:08:56.303 --> 01:08:58.388
And I pray to God
it doesn't happen.

1177
01:08:58.388 --> 01:09:00.724
It's not going to happen.
You got to understand something.

1178
01:09:00.724 --> 01:09:03.352
- I raised him like my own.
- Oh. please.

1179
01:09:03.352 --> 01:09:05.187
The next time we talk
this fucking kid

1180
01:09:05.187 --> 01:09:07.231
better be out of
the picture. Roy.

1181
01:09:07.231 --> 01:09:09.691
Or there's no talk.

1182
01:09:09.691 --> 01:09:11.985
Better get him.

1183
01:09:11.985 --> 01:09:14.321
<i>Roy's true colors
really showed
when he was pissed.</i>

1184
01:09:14.321 --> 01:09:17.616
<i>And that day.
his color was bright red.</i>

1185
01:09:17.616 --> 01:09:20.160
<i>It was obvious that
the shit hit the fan.</i>

1186
01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:21.703
Hey.

1187
01:09:21.703 --> 01:09:23.288
Seen Chris?

1188
01:09:23.288 --> 01:09:25.541
No. no. no. why?

1189
01:09:27.793 --> 01:09:29.461
- You guys are close. right?
- Yeah.

1190
01:09:32.256 --> 01:09:34.383
Find him.

1191
01:09:34.383 --> 01:09:37.219
- Bring him to me.
-  <i>He actually
looked concerned.</i>

1192
01:09:37.219 --> 01:09:39.346
- Just bring him here. okay.
- Okay. yeah.

1193
01:09:39.346 --> 01:09:41.723
- If you talk to him.
you call me.
-  You got it. boss.

1194
01:09:41.723 --> 01:09:44.309
<i>But I knew what would happen
to Chris if he came back here.</i>

1195
01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:45.435
<i>Everybody did.</i>

1196
01:09:45.435 --> 01:09:47.104
No one's seen him.

1197
01:09:47.104 --> 01:09:48.939
<i>I spent the next few days</i>

1198
01:09:48.939 --> 01:09:51.233
<i>turning over every dirty stone
I could think of.</i>

1199
01:09:51.233 --> 01:09:54.736
<i>It was like looking for
a junkie in a haystack.</i>

1200
01:09:54.736 --> 01:09:57.739
<i>Now. while I was
out looking for Chris.</i>

1201
01:09:57.739 --> 01:10:01.326
<i>the crew had other business
to attend to.</i>

1202
01:10:01.326 --> 01:10:02.995
Hey.<i>-Luca Santi.</i>

1203
01:10:02.995 --> 01:10:05.122
Hi. Luca.

1204
01:10:05.122 --> 01:10:10.043
<i>I thought I finally had Gina
figured out. but I was way off.</i>

1205
01:10:12.171 --> 01:10:15.465
<i>They called it
the Gemini Method.</i>

1206
01:10:15.465 --> 01:10:17.843
<i>Gina would lead
the marks to the door.</i>

1207
01:10:17.843 --> 01:10:20.762
<i>A pretty face can really get
a guy's guard down.</i>

1208
01:10:20.762 --> 01:10:23.140
<i>Roy made sure everyone knew
what they were doing.</i>

1209
01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:25.100
<i>I don't know how many times
they did it.</i>

1210
01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:28.228
<i>but it had to be a lot.
They perfected it.</i>

1211
01:10:28.228 --> 01:10:31.315
Come on.

1212
01:10:31.315 --> 01:10:33.942
<i>Roy had had it
with Luka's shortcomings</i>

1213
01:10:33.942 --> 01:10:37.654
<i>and decided it was time
to take him out.</i>

1214
01:10:37.654 --> 01:10:41.783
<i>Roy would start things off
by popping the poor bastard
in the head.</i>

1215
01:10:41.783 --> 01:10:46.163
<i>And someone had to wrap
the head in a towel to keep
the bleeding under control.</i>

1216
01:10:48.498 --> 01:10:52.503
<i>A knife in the heart
would not only make sure
that the bastard was dead.</i>

1217
01:10:52.503 --> 01:10:55.464
<i>but a dead heart would also
stop the bleeding.</i>

1218
01:10:55.464 --> 01:10:58.300
Gina. you okay?

1219
01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:01.011
- Yeah.
- Drag him to the bathtub.

1220
01:11:01.011 --> 01:11:05.182
<i>They'd hang the body
over the bathtub
and drain it dry.</i>

1221
01:11:05.182 --> 01:11:07.851
<i>These fucking guys
sat around eating pizza</i>

1222
01:11:07.851 --> 01:11:11.480
<i>while the body drained
in the tub.</i>

1223
01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:16.360
<i>Roy had one philosophy
no body. no crime.</i>

1224
01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:19.071
<i>So he did what he did best.</i>

1225
01:11:19.071 --> 01:11:21.573
<i>He made that bastard disappear.</i>

1226
01:11:28.330 --> 01:11:31.041
<i>The last step was dumping
the parts
into separate dumpsters</i>

1227
01:11:31.041 --> 01:11:34.294
<i>around town that were special
for food waste.</i>

1228
01:11:34.294 --> 01:11:36.505
<i>They all got put
in a special part of the dump</i>

1229
01:11:36.505 --> 01:11:39.132
<i>where they were buried
because food rots.</i>

1230
01:11:39.132 --> 01:11:41.176
<i>And even if they brought dogs.</i>

1231
01:11:41.176 --> 01:11:44.763
<i>the smell was so bad that
they wouldn't find shit.</i>

1232
01:11:44.763 --> 01:11:47.558
<i>No body. no crime.</i>

1233
01:11:47.558 --> 01:11:49.393
<i>About a week went by.</i>

1234
01:11:49.393 --> 01:11:51.478
<i>Still no sign of Chris.</i>

1235
01:11:51.478 --> 01:11:54.523
<i>The guys weren't really
scouring the earth
for him either.</i>

1236
01:11:54.523 --> 01:11:56.775
<i>Roy was getting paranoid.</i>

1237
01:11:56.775 --> 01:12:00.696
<i>The Colombians wanted blood.
Chris's blood.</i>

1238
01:12:00.696 --> 01:12:02.781
<i>He sent his family out of town</i>

1239
01:12:02.781 --> 01:12:05.158
<i>and locked himself up
in his house.</i>

1240
01:12:05.158 --> 01:12:08.620
<i>One day. Roy spots a guy
parked outside
for a little too long.</i>

1241
01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:11.456
<i>and he absolutely loses it.</i>

1242
01:12:11.456 --> 01:12:15.460
<i>He was sure the Colombians
had sent a hitman
to take him out.</i>

1243
01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:18.672
<i>Roy was MIA
for a while after that.</i>

1244
01:12:18.672 --> 01:12:22.843
<i>Turns out the kid wasn't even
a Colombian hitman after all.</i>

1245
01:12:22.843 --> 01:12:25.012
<i>He was just a kid who went
door to door</i>

1246
01:12:25.012 --> 01:12:27.890
<i>selling vacuums to help
pay for college.</i>

1247
01:12:27.890 --> 01:12:30.434
<i>- Roy was actually
torn up about it.</i>
- Shit.

1248
01:12:30.434 --> 01:12:32.936
Shit!<i>-He didn't leave
his house for days.</i>

1249
01:12:32.936 --> 01:12:35.689
<i>Plus he had Paul Castellano
and the entire</i>

1250
01:12:35.689 --> 01:12:38.901
<i>Gambino family telling him that
if he didn't kill Chris</i>

1251
01:12:38.901 --> 01:12:41.195
<i>that he would take his place.</i>

1252
01:12:41.195 --> 01:12:44.448
<i>And nobody knew
where Chris was.</i>

1253
01:12:46.742 --> 01:12:51.079
<i>For a week I was looking
for that son of a bitch.</i>

1254
01:12:51.079 --> 01:12:52.372
<i>But in the end...</i>

1255
01:12:52.372 --> 01:12:53.498
James?

1256
01:12:53.498 --> 01:12:55.083
<i>...he found me.</i>

1257
01:12:59.755 --> 01:13:01.423
Don't worry.

1258
01:13:01.423 --> 01:13:03.509
You ain't gonna wake him.

1259
01:13:14.770 --> 01:13:17.189
It's over. Chris.

1260
01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:20.108
You're right. Bobby. it is.

1261
01:13:20.108 --> 01:13:23.320
You killed a police officer.
man. that's my fucking partner.

1262
01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:26.823
I fucking trusted you. Bobby.

1263
01:13:26.823 --> 01:13:29.034
What you don't understand--

1264
01:13:29.034 --> 01:13:32.829
No. Shut up. Shut the fuck up.
You mother--

1265
01:13:32.829 --> 01:13:36.625
Fuck! You're fucking cop. Bobby.

1266
01:13:41.797 --> 01:13:45.592
I came to you for your help.
for your guidance.

1267
01:13:45.592 --> 01:13:49.555
And you've got
a fucking family tree.

1268
01:13:49.555 --> 01:13:52.766
Don't even know what Roy's gonna
do to you when he finds out.

1269
01:13:55.519 --> 01:13:59.648
This a lot bigger than
a. a few dead Colombians.

1270
01:13:59.648 --> 01:14:00.691
Don't you?

1271
01:14:00.691 --> 01:14:03.318
Listen to me. Chris.

1272
01:14:03.318 --> 01:14:05.946
We are in the same boat here. okay?

1273
01:14:05.946 --> 01:14:08.365
We're both fucking dead.

1274
01:14:08.365 --> 01:14:10.617
Okay?

1275
01:14:10.617 --> 01:14:12.744
We can make a deal. okay?

1276
01:14:12.744 --> 01:14:14.538
Listen. just listen to me.

1277
01:14:14.538 --> 01:14:17.833
You just give them
all up. all right?

1278
01:14:17.833 --> 01:14:20.335
We're going to put you
in witness protection.

1279
01:14:20.335 --> 01:14:22.838
I can make that fucking call
right now.

1280
01:14:22.838 --> 01:14:24.339
you're fucking dead otherwise.

1281
01:14:24.339 --> 01:14:27.301
I may be a lot of things. Bobby.

1282
01:14:27.301 --> 01:14:30.262
but a rat ain't one of them.

1283
01:14:30.262 --> 01:14:33.849
I need you to sit down now.

1284
01:14:33.849 --> 01:14:36.310
Sit the fuck down. Bobby.

1285
01:14:37.978 --> 01:14:39.605
I'm sitting down. Chris.

1286
01:14:41.523 --> 01:14:42.816
All right?

1287
01:14:50.115 --> 01:14:52.659
Chris. Chris. listen to me.

1288
01:14:52.659 --> 01:14:55.871
You call Roy right now.
and I swear to God.

1289
01:14:55.871 --> 01:14:59.208
he is going to
kill us both. Okay?

1290
01:15:04.171 --> 01:15:05.923
- Roy?
-  <i>Chris.</i>

1291
01:15:05.923 --> 01:15:08.133
<i>- Jesus Christ.</i>
- Yeah. it's me.

1292
01:15:08.133 --> 01:15:10.802
<i>Where the fuck have you been?</i>

1293
01:15:10.802 --> 01:15:14.431
Look. I can't really say
where I've been. but--

1294
01:15:14.431 --> 01:15:15.974
<i>Where are you?</i>

1295
01:15:15.974 --> 01:15:18.310
Look. just listen to me. okay?

1296
01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:19.978
I got something
that's going to knock

1297
01:15:19.978 --> 01:15:21.313
your fucking socks off.

1298
01:15:21.313 --> 01:15:23.690
I know I fucked up big. okay?

1299
01:15:23.690 --> 01:15:25.734
But what I got.
it's going to make you
forgive me

1300
01:15:25.734 --> 01:15:28.737
for all of it.<i>-Forgive you?</i>

1301
01:15:28.737 --> 01:15:31.240
<i>Get your ass over here. Chris.</i>

1302
01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:32.658
I'm leaving soon.

1303
01:15:32.658 --> 01:15:34.451
<i>- Now.</i>
- Okay. I'm bringing Bob--

1304
01:15:42.584 --> 01:15:44.837
Let's go. Bobby.

1305
01:15:48.507 --> 01:15:51.176
Okay. All right.

1306
01:15:56.932 --> 01:15:59.643
<i>That was the longest
ride of my life.</i>

1307
01:15:59.643 --> 01:16:02.104
<i>I knew I was dead on arrival.</i>

1308
01:16:02.104 --> 01:16:04.523
<i>A million things were
racing through my head.</i>

1309
01:16:04.523 --> 01:16:06.984
<i>But one of them was
muting all the others.</i>

1310
01:16:06.984 --> 01:16:08.986
<i>I didn't care
about the cheating.</i>

1311
01:16:08.986 --> 01:16:10.988
<i>I didn't care about anything.</i>

1312
01:16:10.988 --> 01:16:13.991
<i>I just wanted Mary back.</i>

1313
01:16:13.991 --> 01:16:18.829
<i>But in that moment.
in that moment. I realized...</i>

1314
01:16:18.829 --> 01:16:21.915
<i>that I didn't deserve her.</i>

1315
01:16:47.858 --> 01:16:48.859
Fuck.

1316
01:16:55.282 --> 01:16:58.410
Why did he have a gun on you?

1317
01:16:58.410 --> 01:17:00.245
He was out of his mind.

1318
01:17:00.245 --> 01:17:03.290
I mean. he was going to
come here and kill everybody.

1319
01:17:03.290 --> 01:17:04.958
I mean. he showed
up my door acting like

1320
01:17:04.958 --> 01:17:06.752
a fucking lunatic.
saying he was going to use me

1321
01:17:06.752 --> 01:17:08.670
as a decoy. I mean. he was
going to shoot you. Roy.

1322
01:17:08.670 --> 01:17:10.756
He said he was going
to fucking blow away

1323
01:17:10.756 --> 01:17:12.466
fucking everybody. including me.

1324
01:17:12.466 --> 01:17:14.426
I mean. he was
fucking out of control.

1325
01:17:19.389 --> 01:17:20.599
Ah. fuck.

1326
01:17:21.934 --> 01:17:22.976
Put him in the car.

1327
01:17:24.770 --> 01:17:26.271
- Fuck.
- It's just fucked. man.

1328
01:17:26.271 --> 01:17:28.023
Crazy.

1329
01:17:28.023 --> 01:17:29.608
Put him in the car.

1330
01:18:08.647 --> 01:18:11.525
<i>He didn't say a word
the entire drive.</i>

1331
01:18:31.170 --> 01:18:34.965
<i>If I was going to make
a move. it was going to
have to be soon.</i>

1332
01:18:34.965 --> 01:18:38.427
<i>But machine guns were
going to be a problem.</i>

1333
01:18:38.427 --> 01:18:41.388
Will you open the trunk?

1334
01:18:56.486 --> 01:18:58.322
Sorry. kid.

1335
01:19:00.199 --> 01:19:02.618
<i>Roy loved Chris like a son.</i>

1336
01:19:14.588 --> 01:19:16.215
Don't shoot him
in the face. okay?

1337
01:19:37.861 --> 01:19:38.862
Get out of the way.

1338
01:19:59.299 --> 01:20:01.301
<i>I found out later that
in order to appease</i>

1339
01:20:01.301 --> 01:20:03.345
<i>the Colombians. they had
to leave them out there.</i>

1340
01:20:03.345 --> 01:20:05.138
<i>You know. make
a big fucking show of it.</i>

1341
01:20:05.138 --> 01:20:06.932
<i>Make the news and all that.</i>

1342
01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:12.646
<i>I wasn't scared sitting
in the front this time.</i>

1343
01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:17.484
<i>Felt like a cat
with nine fucking lives.</i>

1344
01:20:45.053 --> 01:20:49.057
Come by the apartment
tomorrow night.

1345
01:20:49.057 --> 01:20:51.435
Eight o'clock.

1346
01:20:51.435 --> 01:20:53.854
- For what?
- Play some cards.

1347
01:20:58.942 --> 01:21:01.069
<i>James was dead. Chris was dead.</i>

1348
01:21:01.069 --> 01:21:02.613
<i>The whole thing was

1349
01:21:05.699 --> 01:21:09.369
<i>I never stepped one foot
inside the Gemini Lounge again.</i>

1350
01:21:22.174 --> 01:21:24.051
You good?

1351
01:21:24.051 --> 01:21:25.385
Yeah.

1352
01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:48.492
That's goodbye.

1353
01:21:48.492 --> 01:21:50.577
I don't. I don't understand.

1354
01:21:50.577 --> 01:21:51.912
I told you I was working

1355
01:21:51.912 --> 01:21:53.497
that job. get some extra cash

1356
01:21:53.497 --> 01:21:55.624
on the side. and. um.

1357
01:21:55.624 --> 01:21:58.418
I just wanted you to have it.

1358
01:21:58.418 --> 01:22:01.797
You might hear some things
about me in the next
couple of days.

1359
01:22:01.797 --> 01:22:03.757
What is going on. Bobby?

1360
01:22:03.757 --> 01:22:08.136
I just want you to know
that I'm so sorry.

1361
01:22:08.136 --> 01:22:11.265
For everything. and...

1362
01:22:12.808 --> 01:22:16.103
I really hope...

1363
01:22:16.103 --> 01:22:18.814
that you find the happiness
that you deserve. honey.

1364
01:22:25.028 --> 01:22:26.029
Bobby.

1365
01:22:33.579 --> 01:22:35.455
<i>The department did not take us</i>

1366
01:22:35.455 --> 01:22:37.457
<i>going over their heads lightly.</i>

1367
01:22:37.457 --> 01:22:40.169
<i>We got a fellow officer killed.</i>

1368
01:22:40.169 --> 01:22:44.047
<i>They had no choice but to make
an example out of Rick and me.</i>

1369
01:22:44.047 --> 01:22:46.091
<i>If it wasn't for all
the evidence we got.</i>

1370
01:22:46.091 --> 01:22:49.344
<i>things could have
turned out a lot worse for us.</i>

1371
01:22:49.344 --> 01:22:51.722
<i>But none of it
saw the light of day.</i>

1372
01:22:51.722 --> 01:22:55.225
<i>The Department decided
to save face
and filed everything away.</i>

1373
01:22:57.603 --> 01:22:59.521
<i>It looked
like business as usual.</i>

1374
01:22:59.521 --> 01:23:02.232
<i>but things were never the same.</i>

1375
01:23:02.232 --> 01:23:04.401
<i>Roy was getting
too much FBI attention</i>

1376
01:23:04.401 --> 01:23:07.154
<i>and was convinced that
his days were numbered.</i>

1377
01:23:07.154 --> 01:23:08.822
<i>He was right.</i>

1378
01:23:08.822 --> 01:23:11.950
<i>Paul Costellano
ordered the hit.</i>

1379
01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:17.122
<i>And in the end.
his two most loyal soldiers
did the deed.</i>

1380
01:23:19.166 --> 01:23:24.338
<i>As for me. I couldn't
let it all be for nothing.</i>

1381
01:23:24.338 --> 01:23:26.757
<i>I made a call
and set up a meeting.</i>

1382
01:23:26.757 --> 01:23:30.302
<i>I found someone who wanted
the same thing I did.</i>

1383
01:23:30.302 --> 01:23:32.137
<i>I didn't know
what they looked like.</i>

1384
01:23:32.137 --> 01:23:35.891
<i>but they assured me
that they knew me. So I waited.</i>

How the hell did you fool us?

1395

1402

You go into witness protection.

1403
01:24:55.470 --> 01:24:59.933
And you disappear for the rest

1404
