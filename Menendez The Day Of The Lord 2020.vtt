00:00:52.708 --> 00:00:57.458
POLICE

5
00:01:22.208 --> 00:01:24.708
Why do we have so many security measures
for this idiot?

6
00:01:25.708 --> 00:01:26.708
They say he's damned.

7
00:01:32.291 --> 00:01:34.166
The accursed priest.

8
00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.166
Bless me.

9
00:02:34.625 --> 00:02:36.791
Bless me really hard. Father.

10
00:02:38.833 --> 00:02:41.166
Make me a son. A new son.

11
00:02:42.166 --> 00:02:43.791
The old one is downstairs.

12
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.958
Did you think you saved him?

13
00:02:48.833 --> 00:02:51.583
My son is waiting for you.
with his blown-up head.

14
00:02:52.541 --> 00:02:53.791
Not in heaven...

15
00:02:54.583 --> 00:02:56.958
but in hell. where you sent him.

16
00:02:59.083 --> 00:03:00.666
Does that make you happy?

17
00:03:32.625 --> 00:03:37.583
FRIDAY

18
00:04:00.416 --> 00:04:01.250
Yes?

19
00:04:03.833 --> 00:04:04.708
Hello.

20
00:04:08.541 --> 00:04:09.916
How did you find this number?

21
00:04:13.416 --> 00:04:15.666
No. I'm fine. Relax.

22
00:04:16.625 --> 00:04:17.666
I've been busy.

23
00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:21.250
Yes. I was getting things in order.
you know?

24
00:04:22.416 --> 00:04:23.500
Fixing my house.

25
00:04:26.541 --> 00:04:29.250
I know I should've told you before. but...

26
00:04:30.583 --> 00:04:32.500
I needed time to clear things up.

27
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.416
Of course I'm upset. In fact.
we shouldn't be speaking right now.

28
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.958
Yes. it's been hard.

29
00:04:47.166 --> 00:04:50.291
You're one of the few that still worries
about me since I got out.

30
00:04:50.833 --> 00:04:53.791
SPANISH PRIEST
FOUND GUILTY OF MURDER

31
00:04:55.875 --> 00:04:58.833
I know you don't like me saying this.
but it's the truth.

32
00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:01.291
Lying is a sin.

33
00:05:02.375 --> 00:05:04.041
You know me better than anyone else.

34
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.708
No. I left that behind.

35
00:05:10.291 --> 00:05:11.125
I only smoke now.

36
00:05:16.208 --> 00:05:17.458
I have to go.

37
00:05:18.791 --> 00:05:21.166
Yes. I'll call you. I promise.

38
00:05:52.166 --> 00:05:53.750
Hurry up. you pansy.

39
00:05:54.125 --> 00:05:56.333
Come on. open the door. Menéndez.

40
00:05:58.875 --> 00:06:01.458
"You shall not close the door
to a true friend.

41
00:06:01.541 --> 00:06:04.041
not when all he brings
is kindness inside."

42
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.250
It was something like that.

43
00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:08.500
You taught that to me.

44
00:06:09.208 --> 00:06:11.250
You just made that up. Sebas.

45
00:06:21.875 --> 00:06:24.625
What's happening. man?

46
00:06:24.708 --> 00:06:27.375
Come here. hairy beast.

47
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.333
Well. well. look at this.

48
00:06:35.625 --> 00:06:38.125
I like it.

49
00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:41.333
It has a certain style. 
I don't know what to call it. It's...

50
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:43.541
spacious.

51
00:06:44.541 --> 00:06:46.208
You're not pulling one on me. Sebas.

52
00:06:51.833 --> 00:06:52.791
What do you want?

53
00:06:53.416 --> 00:06:54.291
Nothing.

54
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.125
I just came to visit an old friend.

55
00:06:57.291 --> 00:06:59.041
Am I not allowed to do that. Father?

56
00:06:59.875 --> 00:07:00.875
Don't call me that.

57
00:07:01.833 --> 00:07:02.875
You know that I'm...

58
00:07:04.083 --> 00:07:04.916
I'm not...

59
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Stop it with that bullshit.
You're who you are. That'll never change.

60
00:07:10.583 --> 00:07:11.750
What do you want?

61
00:07:22.416 --> 00:07:23.291
You know...

62
00:07:24.333 --> 00:07:28.375
one thing I learned in life is that one
should have a radar to detect danger.

63
00:07:29.208 --> 00:07:33.000
If you don't pay attention. 
some asshole could slit your throat.

64
00:07:33.291 --> 00:07:34.333
In a split second.

65
00:07:34.541 --> 00:07:36.375
you're dead. asshole.

66
00:07:37.583 --> 00:07:40.083
I always believed 
I had a sixth sense for that.

67
00:07:40.625 --> 00:07:44.500
But once I met you. I realized my talent
was nothing compared to yours.

68
00:07:45.333 --> 00:07:48.000
You can detect evil. I've seen it.

69
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:50.583
At the fifth gallery.

70
00:07:51.458 --> 00:07:52.958
The way you treated people.

71
00:07:53.416 --> 00:07:56.833
The way you calmed them down.
you gave them peace.

72
00:07:57.666 --> 00:07:59.416
That's why you won our respect.

73
00:07:59.583 --> 00:08:03.416
The respect of tough people.
people that don't put up with anything.

74
00:08:03.791 --> 00:08:05.041
And look at what it did.

75
00:08:05.875 --> 00:08:09.000
I was the biggest son of a bitch
you could've ever met.

76
00:08:10.375 --> 00:08:11.666
I've done so many things...

77
00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:14.333
terrible. shitty things...

78
00:08:16.375 --> 00:08:19.125
Calm down. Sebastián. calm down.
Tell me.

79
00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:21.875
I didn't see this coming.

80
00:08:22.041 --> 00:08:25.375
I didn't see it coming. shit.

81
00:08:26.791 --> 00:08:28.791
You know about regret.

82
00:08:29.291 --> 00:08:31.291
You know the meaning of forgiveness.

83
00:08:31.375 --> 00:08:33.000
Remember what you said to me.

84
00:08:33.333 --> 00:08:35.458
about what you did before going in?

85
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.583
Why did they pick you?

86
00:08:39.333 --> 00:08:41.291
To help the weak.

87
00:08:41.625 --> 00:08:42.833
the lost ones.

88
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.041
Those that let Satan dry their souls
and rot their hearts.

89
00:08:47.291 --> 00:08:48.541
Sebas. stop.

90
00:08:49.291 --> 00:08:50.291
What's going on?

91
00:08:50.791 --> 00:08:52.375
Are you using again?

92
00:08:52.791 --> 00:08:54.041
I wish. I...

93
00:08:55.666 --> 00:08:57.166
I need your help now.

94
00:08:58.166 --> 00:08:59.625
I really need your help.

95
00:09:00.708 --> 00:09:03.208
It would be fine 
if they did anything to me.

96
00:09:03.416 --> 00:09:05.083
Open me up completely.

97
00:09:05.208 --> 00:09:10.416
eviscerate me. step on my head.
even cut my balls off.

98
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.208
But not this. Not this. fuck.

99
00:09:12.583 --> 00:09:17.583
Not this. No one should touch my baby.
And that thing isn't my daughter anymore.

100
00:09:17.666 --> 00:09:19.875
No. no. What are you saying?

101
00:09:20.333 --> 00:09:22.250
My daughter has it inside.

102
00:09:22.541 --> 00:09:26.750
She has the goddamn horned devil
inside her body.

103
00:09:26.833 --> 00:09:28.500
What are you saying. you sinner?

104
00:09:29.208 --> 00:09:31.583
Please. help me. I'm begging you.

105
00:09:31.875 --> 00:09:34.666
You have to get it out.
You're the only one who can.

106
00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.083
Please. don't do it for me.

107
00:09:36.416 --> 00:09:38.375
I'm just a piece of shit.

108
00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:39.916
But her...

109
00:09:40.458 --> 00:09:42.208
None of this is her fault.

110
00:09:44.541 --> 00:09:45.708
I tried everything.

111
00:09:46.125 --> 00:09:48.375
Mental hospitals. doctors.

112
00:09:54.125 --> 00:09:56.625
You do know my methods
are very particular. right?

113
00:09:56.708 --> 00:09:57.541
Yes.

114
00:10:00.125 --> 00:10:02.458
And knowing that this situation
could get violent...

115
00:10:04.541 --> 00:10:06.500
are you still willing
to go through with it?

116
00:10:06.625 --> 00:10:09.833
I'd rather see my daughter die
and go to heaven with the Lord

117
00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.666
than for her to be alive with Satan.

118
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.583
Sebas. it could be many other things.

119
00:10:15.166 --> 00:10:18.541
She could be going through a bad phase.
or have bad influences in her life.

120
00:10:18.625 --> 00:10:20.250
My daughter is possessed.

121
00:10:20.541 --> 00:10:23.041
Please. do you think I'm stupid?

122
00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:26.916
I bought her a cat. A Persian cat.

123
00:10:27.833 --> 00:10:29.916
That cat was very fucking expensive.

124
00:10:30.791 --> 00:10:33.708
They became inseparable.
They were always together.

125
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.375
One day. the cat disappeared.
I found its body buried in the garden.

126
00:10:38.458 --> 00:10:39.625
Beheaded.

127
00:10:40.333 --> 00:10:42.208
My daughter acted as if nothing happened.

128
00:10:42.833 --> 00:10:47.041
A few days later. I found the head
under her bed. in a shoe box.

129
00:10:48.041 --> 00:10:50.208
I have no doubt that she did it.

130
00:10:51.291 --> 00:10:52.541
When I saw her...

131
00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.166
it wasn't her.

132
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.500
I saw the Devil himself.

133
00:11:00.375 --> 00:11:01.583
Those eyes.

134
00:11:04.041 --> 00:11:06.666
I'll never forget those eyes.

135
00:11:21.166 --> 00:11:22.541
Bring her to me tomorrow.

136
00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:51.125
HORNY GIRLS

137
00:11:56.416 --> 00:11:59.291
LOADING... WAIT A MOMENT

138
00:12:07.458 --> 00:12:10.791
I'm not buying anything.
Get out of here!

139
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.625
It's me. Father. Marisa.

140
00:12:14.041 --> 00:12:15.208
Of course.

141
00:12:16.916 --> 00:12:18.125
Marisa. of course.

142
00:12:20.666 --> 00:12:21.541
How stupid of me.

143
00:12:25.708 --> 00:12:26.750
It's Friday.

144
00:12:27.916 --> 00:12:29.291
I know it's Friday.

145
00:12:29.875 --> 00:12:30.958
That's why I'm here.

146
00:12:33.208 --> 00:12:34.250
I forgot about it.

147
00:12:36.083 --> 00:12:38.000
I don't even know what day it is. Marisa.

148
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.791
You should go out more. Father.

149
00:12:42.875 --> 00:12:45.166
It's not right for you
to always be locked in here.

150
00:12:47.791 --> 00:12:48.625
How are you?

151
00:12:49.875 --> 00:12:52.083
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

152
00:12:56.708 --> 00:12:58.458
Before I forget. Father.

153
00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:01.875
Lola and Martín say "hi."

154
00:13:04.541 --> 00:13:05.708
From the store.

155
00:13:07.583 --> 00:13:09.416
They're wondering when you'll come by.

156
00:13:10.083 --> 00:13:11.750
They really want to see you.

157
00:13:15.666 --> 00:13:17.791
Leave it. It's not necessary.

158
00:13:17.875 --> 00:13:20.000
-But. Father--
-I've told you a million times.

159
00:13:20.291 --> 00:13:24.125
It's not necessary for you to keep coming.
I'm grateful. but it's not necessary.

160
00:13:26.291 --> 00:13:28.250
But it pains me to see you this way.

161
00:13:29.916 --> 00:13:31.666
You have no idea how much it does.

162
00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:33.791
And I just want to be alone.

163
00:13:34.916 --> 00:13:36.625
I'm fine. don't worry.

164
00:13:38.041 --> 00:13:38.916
I'm fine.

165
00:13:39.708 --> 00:13:41.041
You don't owe me anything.

166
00:13:42.916 --> 00:13:44.000
I owe you my life.

167
00:13:45.083 --> 00:13:46.125
You saved me.

168
00:13:48.166 --> 00:13:49.041
Maybe.

169
00:13:52.416 --> 00:13:53.583
But at what cost?

170
00:13:55.791 --> 00:13:57.416
I don't know if it was worth it.

171
00:13:59.583 --> 00:14:01.166
Never doubt that. Father.

172
00:14:02.833 --> 00:14:04.458
Just look around you.

173
00:14:06.333 --> 00:14:08.333
Surely you know there's a God.

174
00:14:10.166 --> 00:14:11.791
Look into my eyes.

175
00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.041
He's in there.

176
00:14:16.541 --> 00:14:17.708
In my mouth.

177
00:14:21.541 --> 00:14:22.750
In my heart.

178
00:14:26.166 --> 00:14:27.333
In your mouth.

179
00:14:32.416 --> 00:14:33.416
What time is it?

180
00:14:34.625 --> 00:14:36.791
I have so much left to do.

181
00:14:38.166 --> 00:14:40.791
But I'll come back to do the dishes.

182
00:14:40.875 --> 00:14:44.333
I have no problem doing them. Father.

183
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.291
Don't worry about it.

184
00:14:55.916 --> 00:14:58.083
When I need you. I'll call you.

185
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.916
But you shouldn't live like this.

186
00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:07.666
Why don't you move
to the guest house?

187
00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.833
You'd have clean clothes.

188
00:15:12.625 --> 00:15:14.208
Warm food.

189
00:15:15.833 --> 00:15:16.916
And I...

190
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.708
I'd take care of you. Father.

191
00:15:59.166 --> 00:16:00.125
You again?

192
00:16:00.791 --> 00:16:02.000
What do you want?

193
00:16:03.208 --> 00:16:04.666
Are you really asking me that?

194
00:16:06.541 --> 00:16:07.541
I don't know.

195
00:16:08.833 --> 00:16:10.958
Ask her yourself. Ask Marisa.

196
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Or what?

197
00:16:14.375 --> 00:16:17.458
Don't you think I know you send her
every Friday? I'm not stupid.

198
00:16:20.416 --> 00:16:21.500
You know what?

199
00:16:22.458 --> 00:16:23.750
I lied to you before.

200
00:16:24.875 --> 00:16:27.458
Of course I drink. Of course I do.

201
00:16:27.708 --> 00:16:31.708
It's the only thing that keeps me here.
that allows me to put up with myself.

202
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.291
That's why I don't call you
or invite you to my house.

203
00:16:38.375 --> 00:16:39.625
And I want to apologize.

204
00:17:37.666 --> 00:17:38.791
Protection?

205
00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:58.916
SATURDAY

206
00:20:25.333 --> 00:20:29.875
E. MENÉNDEZ. THE PRIEST:
VICTIM AND EXECUTIONER

207
00:20:46.583 --> 00:20:47.916
He's with the Lord now.

208
00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:53.291
I know we belong to you.

209
00:20:56.291 --> 00:20:57.583
But he was too young.

210
00:21:11.833 --> 00:21:12.666
Who is it?

211
00:21:13.125 --> 00:21:14.500
Good afternoon. Father.

212
00:21:15.583 --> 00:21:16.958
What did I tell you yesterday?

213
00:21:17.791 --> 00:21:19.416
Good afternoon. Menéndez.

214
00:21:50.333 --> 00:21:53.375
Lower the volume.
You're going to end up deaf.

215
00:22:02.083 --> 00:22:06.333
Look. honey. he's Mr. Menéndez.
The friend I told you about.

216
00:22:32.291 --> 00:22:34.958
Pay no mind to her.
You know how young people are nowadays.

217
00:22:35.041 --> 00:22:36.750
Shit! I almost died.

218
00:22:45.083 --> 00:22:47.208
You see. honey? You'll be fine here.

219
00:23:04.208 --> 00:23:06.750
Poor thing.
I don't even get mad at her anymore.

220
00:23:06.833 --> 00:23:09.250
We've had to go to so many places.

221
00:23:09.333 --> 00:23:11.750
that she's probably tired of it by now.

222
00:23:12.291 --> 00:23:13.541
And I feel the same way.

223
00:23:14.916 --> 00:23:16.541
She seems to be fine right now.

224
00:23:17.208 --> 00:23:19.291
But I guess I don't have to tell you that.

225
00:23:20.416 --> 00:23:21.375
Sebas.

226
00:23:22.416 --> 00:23:25.333
I'm sorry to make you come here
and waste your time...

227
00:23:26.875 --> 00:23:28.291
but I don't think I can.

228
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.416
-What are you saying?
-I don't feel ready.

229
00:23:31.791 --> 00:23:32.958
What are you saying?

230
00:23:35.625 --> 00:23:36.666
What are you saying?

231
00:23:37.708 --> 00:23:40.958
For fuck's sake.
don't give me that bullshit now.

232
00:23:41.041 --> 00:23:43.125
Can't you see? This is crazy!

233
00:23:43.208 --> 00:23:46.541
What's crazy is what's happening
to my daughter.

234
00:23:47.125 --> 00:23:51.375
You promised me yesterday.
Right here. Or am I lying?

235
00:23:51.458 --> 00:23:53.041
No. you're not lying.

236
00:23:53.625 --> 00:23:55.458
But I wasn't myself yesterday.

237
00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:58.125
I was a little drunk.

238
00:24:07.041 --> 00:24:10.166
-What are you doing. Sebastián?
-This needs to end now.

239
00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.125
You have no right. none!

240
00:24:12.791 --> 00:24:15.000
Have I ever asked you
to start doing drugs again?

241
00:24:15.458 --> 00:24:18.041
No. this isn't that simple. my friend.

242
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.750
Don't you get it? The things I'll have
to do to your daughter will destroy me!

243
00:24:24.708 --> 00:24:28.375
Maybe I should slit my own throat
with that knife and not do it.

244
00:24:29.166 --> 00:24:32.208
And I don't mean that to be pitiful.

245
00:24:38.875 --> 00:24:39.958
Fine.

246
00:24:40.208 --> 00:24:42.833
I'll see what I can do.
But get up. come on.

247
00:24:42.916 --> 00:24:45.083
Thank you. Thank you very much.

248
00:24:52.291 --> 00:24:53.416
I'm leaving. honey.

249
00:25:01.916 --> 00:25:02.791
Behave.

250
00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:27.125
Your father is a good man.

251
00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:29.750
-He really loves you.
-He's crazy.

252
00:25:32.708 --> 00:25:34.916
But he says I'm the crazy one.

253
00:25:37.833 --> 00:25:38.875
But whatever.

254
00:25:40.125 --> 00:25:42.333
As long as I don't have
to keep listening to him.

255
00:25:43.208 --> 00:25:44.166
Here I am.

256
00:25:44.875 --> 00:25:45.750
That's right.

257
00:25:46.958 --> 00:25:47.958
Here we are.

258
00:25:48.875 --> 00:25:49.791
Yes.

259
00:25:54.083 --> 00:25:55.166
Well...

260
00:25:56.625 --> 00:25:58.125
Shall I show you around?

261
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.916
So you can start familiarizing yourself.

262
00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:03.083
I guess.

263
00:26:06.583 --> 00:26:09.166
The living room is here.
and the kitchen is that way.

264
00:26:10.333 --> 00:26:11.166
Follow me.

265
00:26:11.833 --> 00:26:13.208
I'll show you to your room.

266
00:26:42.166 --> 00:26:43.000
Look.

267
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:46.041
This is your room.

268
00:26:55.666 --> 00:26:57.833
The bathroom's right there.

269
00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:03.625
I'll leave you to it.
Make yourself at home.

270
00:27:04.583 --> 00:27:06.500
I'll be downstairs in the living room.

271
00:27:13.708 --> 00:27:14.875
So now what?

272
00:27:15.708 --> 00:27:17.666
Am I supposed to vomit bile?

273
00:27:29.166 --> 00:27:30.125
Shit.

274
00:28:05.625 --> 00:28:06.666
What's up. girl?

275
00:28:07.166 --> 00:28:08.166
Are you guys there?

276
00:28:10.458 --> 00:28:11.291
Well...

277
00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:14.916
No. I just got here.

278
00:28:15.833 --> 00:28:16.666
But...

279
00:28:16.916 --> 00:28:20.500
I saw there's a subway station nearby.
so I'll be there in an hour.

280
00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:24.958
Of course I'll be there.

281
00:28:26.208 --> 00:28:29.291
You think I'd stay in some priest's house?
Fuck. no.

282
00:28:33.625 --> 00:28:37.625
Yes. but they had fought
and needed to be alone. so...

283
00:28:38.083 --> 00:28:39.083
I said yes.

284
00:28:39.833 --> 00:28:42.250
Then maybe they'll reconcile or something.

285
00:28:48.041 --> 00:28:48.875
Hey.

286
00:28:51.125 --> 00:28:52.375
I have to go.

287
00:28:53.916 --> 00:28:55.000
See you soon.

288
00:28:55.958 --> 00:28:56.791
Yes.

289
00:29:47.125 --> 00:29:48.083
What's wrong?

290
00:29:49.375 --> 00:29:51.791
In the-- in the closet.

291
00:29:52.916 --> 00:29:54.333
Someone was watching me.

292
00:30:19.208 --> 00:30:20.208
Shit.

293
00:30:23.208 --> 00:30:24.291
Open this door!

294
00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:27.166
Open the door!

295
00:30:30.333 --> 00:30:32.916
It was you. wasn't it? You old pig!

296
00:30:33.541 --> 00:30:37.416
Open the door. or I'll start screaming
that you're raping me!

297
00:30:38.291 --> 00:30:39.500
I have no neighbors.

298
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:41.333
Who else would live around here?

299
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:44.125
I said open the fucking door.

300
00:30:44.375 --> 00:30:47.166
You fucking pedophile. Open it now!

301
00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:48.500
You're holding it...

302
00:30:52.833 --> 00:30:53.833
the wrong way.

303
00:32:33.041 --> 00:32:34.583
I was just about to wake you up.

304
00:32:39.416 --> 00:32:40.250
Here.

305
00:32:52.583 --> 00:32:53.833
I know that this...

306
00:32:54.708 --> 00:32:56.375
can't be easy for you.

307
00:32:58.541 --> 00:33:00.666
Being here. with a complete stranger.

308
00:33:04.916 --> 00:33:06.750
But you must trust your father.

309
00:33:08.625 --> 00:33:10.125
He's doing it for your own good.

310
00:33:12.416 --> 00:33:14.416
To be honest. I...

311
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.541
I also wasn't very convinced
to begin with.

312
00:33:19.416 --> 00:33:20.958
But you know him.

313
00:33:21.666 --> 00:33:22.750
He's very persuasive.

314
00:33:26.375 --> 00:33:28.041
You must know better than anyone.

315
00:33:28.625 --> 00:33:29.666
He won't stop.

316
00:33:30.541 --> 00:33:33.500
Until we take out the Devil
from inside you. shit!

317
00:33:38.333 --> 00:33:39.250
Is it hot?

318
00:33:40.625 --> 00:33:41.583
The tea.

319
00:33:42.833 --> 00:33:43.875
Is it hot?

320
00:33:56.083 --> 00:33:56.916
Yes.

321
00:33:57.833 --> 00:33:58.666
A little.

322
00:34:01.708 --> 00:34:02.833
But I like it like this.

323
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:04.750
It was an eventful morning.

324
00:34:10.166 --> 00:34:12.000
You'll see. this will be over soon.

325
00:34:14.708 --> 00:34:17.083
I imagine you already had plans for today.
Right?

326
00:34:18.208 --> 00:34:19.125
Of course.

327
00:34:20.833 --> 00:34:22.416
Were you going out with friends?

328
00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:27.208
Were you spying on me?

329
00:34:32.833 --> 00:34:33.666
So what?

330
00:34:34.791 --> 00:34:37.500
Aren't you going to tell me
where you and your friends were going?

331
00:34:39.416 --> 00:34:41.416
This guy is so intense.

332
00:34:43.041 --> 00:34:46.541
Your dad said you've been going out a lot
these past few months.

333
00:34:46.708 --> 00:34:48.541
My father can go screw himself.

334
00:34:49.083 --> 00:34:50.958
My dad. my dad.

335
00:34:51.916 --> 00:34:54.333
He keeps insisting that I'm acting weird.

336
00:34:55.208 --> 00:34:58.541
He keeps telling that to everyone. Fuck...

337
00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:00.666
I'm a teenager.

338
00:35:01.625 --> 00:35:04.458
It's normal for us to be weird. Right?

339
00:35:05.166 --> 00:35:07.541
A very foul-mouthed teenager. for sure.

340
00:35:08.083 --> 00:35:11.833
Go fuck yourself. you son of a bitch.

341
00:35:11.916 --> 00:35:15.708
Idiot. asshole. stupid. moron.

342
00:35:28.208 --> 00:35:29.250
I don't do drugs.

343
00:35:30.416 --> 00:35:33.416
I don't even steal candy
at the store. Okay?

344
00:35:36.416 --> 00:35:38.541
I have a dancing group with my friends.

345
00:35:42.666 --> 00:35:46.541
We want to be in a talent show on TV.

346
00:35:48.666 --> 00:35:50.666
With the money I was going to make there.

347
00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:52.541
I was going to leave my house.

348
00:35:54.958 --> 00:35:57.250
-Is that so strange?
-No.

349
00:35:58.375 --> 00:35:59.416
It's not strange.

350
00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:02.416
In fact. we just finished a dance.

351
00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:05.083
It's amazing.

352
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:07.833
Can I show you?

353
00:36:09.125 --> 00:36:12.250
-Yes. I'd like to see it.
-Yes?

354
00:36:13.625 --> 00:36:15.791
You dirty old man.

355
00:36:18.291 --> 00:36:21.916
You think I'd start dancing here.
in front of a priest?

356
00:36:22.583 --> 00:36:24.875
Knowing your shady reputation?

357
00:36:25.375 --> 00:36:26.541
Fuck. no.

358
00:36:30.833 --> 00:36:32.666
We'd have to know each other first.

359
00:36:40.458 --> 00:36:41.750
You want to know me...

360
00:36:43.125 --> 00:36:44.291
Father?

361
00:36:44.916 --> 00:36:46.125
You're evil incarnate.

362
00:36:51.583 --> 00:36:53.041
You're so direct.

363
00:36:56.541 --> 00:36:57.791
Did you undress me?

364
00:37:02.583 --> 00:37:06.458
Did you see me naked. Father?

365
00:37:12.166 --> 00:37:13.250
I have to pee.

366
00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:17.125
Careful with the handle. it's broken.

367
00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:32.166
This dude is so strange.

368
00:37:45.541 --> 00:37:48.333
This man is so crazy.

369
00:38:35.083 --> 00:38:36.291
Occupied!

370
00:38:38.625 --> 00:38:40.125
Occupied!

371
00:38:41.166 --> 00:38:42.541
Wait!

372
00:38:46.458 --> 00:38:47.666
Menéndez!

373
00:38:49.708 --> 00:38:51.125
Menéndez!

374
00:38:51.916 --> 00:38:53.125
Did you call me?

375
00:38:53.333 --> 00:38:54.791
Yes. what are you doing?

376
00:38:55.375 --> 00:38:57.916
Nothing. I'm down here. What's going on?

377
00:39:02.583 --> 00:39:03.791
Nothing!

378
00:39:04.375 --> 00:39:05.541
Nothing.

379
00:39:09.041 --> 00:39:12.541
Fuck. maybe my dad is right
and I am crazy.

380
00:39:46.208 --> 00:39:48.083
One of the beams is loose.

381
00:39:48.333 --> 00:39:50.500
It won't tighten up. 
no matter how much I try.

382
00:39:50.958 --> 00:39:52.333
But I'll fix it right away.

383
00:39:53.541 --> 00:39:55.500
Wait for me downstairs.
I'll be right there.

384
00:39:55.583 --> 00:39:57.416
Don't worry. I didn't...

385
00:39:59.666 --> 00:40:00.666
I just peed.

386
00:40:32.375 --> 00:40:34.500
Why does your father think
you're possessed?

387
00:40:40.541 --> 00:40:42.916
He told me about your cat.
among other things.

388
00:40:45.208 --> 00:40:46.833
My cat disappeared. That's it.

389
00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:49.875
I don't know what he told you.

390
00:40:50.666 --> 00:40:52.750
but don't believe everything he says.

391
00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:55.375
Or what?

392
00:40:57.083 --> 00:40:58.875
Do you really think I'm possessed?

393
00:41:00.791 --> 00:41:02.208
I know you feel it. Raquel.

394
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:03.958
That strength.

395
00:41:04.958 --> 00:41:07.791
The inertia to disregard everything
and question everything.

396
00:41:07.875 --> 00:41:10.333
To laugh about everything
and look down at everything.

397
00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.708
You're young. Raquel. That's not bad.

398
00:41:14.458 --> 00:41:15.541
It's not a sin.

399
00:41:16.916 --> 00:41:18.666
Priests are so funny.

400
00:41:19.708 --> 00:41:21.125
Free will doesn't exist.

401
00:41:21.625 --> 00:41:24.791
He knows everything you'll do.
everything you'll think. before you do.

402
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:27.041
But you shouldn't fear.

403
00:41:27.875 --> 00:41:30.583
To love someone that understands you
just the way you are...

404
00:41:31.041 --> 00:41:32.625
Isn't it wonderful to have that trust?

405
00:41:35.458 --> 00:41:36.708
Don't lecture me.

406
00:41:37.208 --> 00:41:39.583
I'm not lecturing. I'm just speaking.

407
00:41:42.666 --> 00:41:43.791
You're weird.

408
00:41:46.666 --> 00:41:48.000
The way you speak.

409
00:41:49.041 --> 00:41:51.000
Living alone in this house.

410
00:41:54.416 --> 00:41:55.333
I don't know.

411
00:41:56.625 --> 00:41:57.500
It's strange.

412
00:41:59.166 --> 00:42:00.666
I haven't always lived here.

413
00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:02.958
-Before...
-Before?

414
00:42:04.208 --> 00:42:05.250
Before going to jail?

415
00:42:08.166 --> 00:42:10.458
I don't know what you did
to end up there...

416
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.125
but my dad always speaks highly of you.

417
00:42:15.333 --> 00:42:17.208
Even though he hates priests.

418
00:42:17.958 --> 00:42:20.000
At his core. your father is a good person.

419
00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:23.833
It's there. even if he doesn't show it.
He's suffered a lot.

420
00:42:26.541 --> 00:42:28.125
My father's an idiot.

421
00:42:29.875 --> 00:42:31.083
Don't speak ill of your father.

422
00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:33.083
Never.

423
00:42:33.791 --> 00:42:36.000
Your father has made mistakes
many times.

424
00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:38.125
but he's trying to make amends.

425
00:42:38.666 --> 00:42:40.666
He's trying to help you.
so you won't suffer.

426
00:42:53.125 --> 00:42:54.000
As I was saying.

427
00:42:54.875 --> 00:42:56.208
I haven't always lived here.

428
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:59.625
I used to work and travel a lot.

429
00:43:00.666 --> 00:43:02.125
I knew a lot of people. but...

430
00:43:04.083 --> 00:43:05.250
but those days are over.

431
00:43:06.875 --> 00:43:07.833
A girl?

432
00:43:09.375 --> 00:43:10.333
Yes?

433
00:43:12.666 --> 00:43:13.500
Of course.

434
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:16.375
I've known many women.

435
00:43:17.083 --> 00:43:18.041
And many men.

436
00:43:20.666 --> 00:43:22.458
That's not what I'm talking about.

437
00:43:23.666 --> 00:43:25.250
I know that.

438
00:43:25.958 --> 00:43:27.958
You want to know if I had a girlfriend.

439
00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:31.833
Well. yes.

440
00:43:32.791 --> 00:43:34.125
Those who are like you...

441
00:43:35.333 --> 00:43:36.166
can you?

442
00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:38.416
I met a girl once.
like the ones you're mentioning.

443
00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:41.666
Shit. that's rough.

444
00:43:41.916 --> 00:43:43.541
But nothing happened between us.

445
00:43:43.958 --> 00:43:45.333
Although I did love her.

446
00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:48.166
In fact...

447
00:43:49.333 --> 00:43:51.375
it made me question my career choice.

448
00:43:52.416 --> 00:43:53.750
I was about to...

449
00:43:55.791 --> 00:43:56.708
but I didn't.

450
00:43:58.666 --> 00:44:01.208
So you and her never...

451
00:44:04.666 --> 00:44:05.500
you know...

452
00:44:13.125 --> 00:44:14.916
Our relationship was different.

453
00:44:16.375 --> 00:44:17.750
By then. I had realized

454
00:44:17.833 --> 00:44:20.875
that I had a different way
of connecting with people.

455
00:44:23.416 --> 00:44:25.791
I realized there are things
that aren't meant for me.

456
00:44:28.333 --> 00:44:29.375
That's shitty.

457
00:44:29.916 --> 00:44:30.791
Maybe.

458
00:44:32.416 --> 00:44:33.708
Has it ever happened to you?

459
00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:36.333
Something you couldn't explain.

460
00:44:37.166 --> 00:44:39.250
Something that makes you
question everything.

461
00:44:42.041 --> 00:44:43.833
When everything becomes dark...

462
00:44:45.708 --> 00:44:47.125
and you pick the wrong path.

463
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:55.125
You can tell me.

464
00:44:56.791 --> 00:44:58.041
It'll stay between us.

465
00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:00.916
Tell me. Raquel.

466
00:45:02.333 --> 00:45:03.750
I will understand.

467
00:45:08.916 --> 00:45:10.916
I also met someone.

468
00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:15.750
He was older than me.

469
00:45:17.125 --> 00:45:18.666
He didn't go to my school.

470
00:45:23.125 --> 00:45:24.875
Javi invited me to a party.

471
00:45:27.583 --> 00:45:29.666
But my dad won't let me go
to those things.

472
00:45:31.791 --> 00:45:32.625
So I...

473
00:45:33.291 --> 00:45:34.958
lied to my father and went anyway.

474
00:45:37.708 --> 00:45:39.375
But it wasn't a real party.

475
00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:44.875
Javi was there...

476
00:45:45.541 --> 00:45:46.708
with his friends.

477
00:45:48.666 --> 00:45:49.833
And a few women.

478
00:45:51.958 --> 00:45:52.916
Watching me.

479
00:45:56.541 --> 00:45:58.416
Everyone was making fun of me.

480
00:46:02.291 --> 00:46:03.958
But I don't know...

481
00:46:04.625 --> 00:46:05.708
I don't know...

482
00:46:06.875 --> 00:46:10.000
I didn't want them to think
I was just a little girl.

483
00:46:12.666 --> 00:46:14.541
I can't remember everything.

484
00:46:24.916 --> 00:46:25.916
I'm sorry.

485
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.083
I'm sorry.

486
00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:52.625
Let me show you my dance.

487
00:47:03.166 --> 00:47:06.416
Don't worry. I know it by memory.
Besides. I can hear it.

488
00:47:22.625 --> 00:47:23.666
Let's go!

489
00:48:18.833 --> 00:48:19.875
Let's go to bed.

490
00:50:19.041 --> 00:50:19.916
Please.

491
00:50:22.041 --> 00:50:23.291
Please. let me go.

492
00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:27.250
I didn't do anything.
Let me go. please.

493
00:50:27.708 --> 00:50:30.125
I swear... I swear...

494
00:50:30.208 --> 00:50:32.833
I didn't do anything. I swear.

495
00:50:34.666 --> 00:50:35.750
Call my dad.

496
00:50:35.833 --> 00:50:37.875
Call my dad. please.

497
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.166
Please.

498
00:50:44.708 --> 00:50:47.041
I won't say anything. I swear.

499
00:50:48.708 --> 00:50:50.583
Please. let me go.

500
00:50:52.166 --> 00:50:54.583
Please. let me go.

501
00:50:54.875 --> 00:50:57.083
Let me go. please.

502
00:51:05.125 --> 00:51:10.083
Let me go. I swear. I won't tell anyone.
I swear.

503
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:11.375
Please.

504
00:51:15.166 --> 00:51:16.416
The day of the Lord.

505
00:51:17.333 --> 00:51:21.000
SUNDAY

506
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.250
This is where we find ourselves.

507
00:51:34.041 --> 00:51:35.333
You and me.

508
00:51:35.958 --> 00:51:36.791
Alone.

509
00:51:39.791 --> 00:51:41.208
I want to show you something.

510
00:51:54.833 --> 00:51:55.666
Look.

511
00:51:56.875 --> 00:51:58.833
I've had to do it quickly. but...

512
00:51:59.208 --> 00:52:00.875
my work was well worth it. right?

513
00:52:01.583 --> 00:52:03.083
What are you going to do with it?

514
00:52:05.041 --> 00:52:06.833
I'd rather not use it. but...

515
00:52:07.375 --> 00:52:09.125
I don't think I'll be that fortunate.

516
00:52:13.166 --> 00:52:14.250
You see...

517
00:52:16.625 --> 00:52:19.000
my working methods are very rough.

518
00:52:20.333 --> 00:52:22.416
I've been fighting evil for years.

519
00:52:23.125 --> 00:52:25.000
The most efficient.

520
00:52:25.666 --> 00:52:28.541
fastest way of completing my task.

521
00:52:28.958 --> 00:52:30.000
is this one.

522
00:52:31.625 --> 00:52:34.125
Believe me when I say it.
I don't like it at all. but...

523
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.583
not all jobs are pleasant. right?

524
00:52:39.375 --> 00:52:40.958
So let's do it the easy way.

525
00:52:42.041 --> 00:52:43.500
I won't ask for your name.

526
00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:45.625
or what you want.

527
00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:48.916
Just go away.

528
00:52:49.416 --> 00:52:52.208
Leave. and leave this body alone.

529
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.208
Otherwise.

530
00:52:56.250 --> 00:52:58.833
you'll have to feel true pain.

531
00:52:59.916 --> 00:53:03.000
And when you want to leave.
you won't be able to.

532
00:53:04.333 --> 00:53:06.708
And you'll beg me to kill you.

533
00:53:10.041 --> 00:53:11.125
And I will.

534
00:53:12.541 --> 00:53:14.791
-I'm afraid.
-No.

535
00:53:15.583 --> 00:53:16.958
You're not afraid.

536
00:53:17.875 --> 00:53:19.375
You're fear itself.

537
00:53:19.791 --> 00:53:20.958
You're evil incarnate.

538
00:53:24.416 --> 00:53:26.000
You're crazy.

539
00:53:26.541 --> 00:53:28.666
You're fucking crazy.

540
00:53:29.041 --> 00:53:30.625
Get me out of here.

541
00:53:30.916 --> 00:53:32.791
I don't like being played with.

542
00:53:33.083 --> 00:53:35.208
Abandon this girl's body.

543
00:53:38.250 --> 00:53:39.833
I don't like to repeat myself.

544
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.083
Leave this girl's body.

545
00:53:47.208 --> 00:53:48.625
I'm telling you again.

546
00:53:49.125 --> 00:53:50.916
Abandon Raquel's body!

547
00:53:51.416 --> 00:53:54.458
Go fuck yourself. you crazy asshole!

548
00:54:01.041 --> 00:54:02.875
Did you think it was just for show?

549
00:54:04.625 --> 00:54:07.083
Doing something just for show is lying.

550
00:54:07.541 --> 00:54:10.750
and lying is a sin.

551
00:54:13.625 --> 00:54:15.666
A sin!

552
00:54:23.166 --> 00:54:25.041
What now? What?

553
00:54:25.458 --> 00:54:26.500
Shall we go on?

554
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.000
Or are you leaving?

555
00:54:45.583 --> 00:54:47.000
It's decided. then.

556
00:55:29.166 --> 00:55:31.041
Yes. relax. she's here.

557
00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:33.125
But...

558
00:55:33.375 --> 00:55:35.500
I'll need you to come over and help me.

559
00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:41.083
I'm sorry for calling so late.

560
00:55:41.291 --> 00:55:42.708
but I had to call you.

561
00:55:43.583 --> 00:55:45.666
I already started.
There's no doubt about it.

562
00:55:46.791 --> 00:55:49.375
It's a possession. And a strong one.

563
00:55:49.958 --> 00:55:51.708
But Sebastián can take it.

564
00:55:51.958 --> 00:55:54.916
He needs his most loved person near me.
That's the method.

565
00:55:55.375 --> 00:55:57.416
It's time to do something good. right?

566
00:55:59.666 --> 00:56:00.791
Thank you for listening.

567
00:56:01.458 --> 00:56:02.416
Hearing your voice...

568
00:56:03.291 --> 00:56:04.625
gives me encouragement.

569
00:56:39.375 --> 00:56:41.750
Where is she? Where?

570
00:56:41.916 --> 00:56:43.208
Where's my daughter?

571
00:56:44.083 --> 00:56:46.083
-I have her downstairs.
-Downstairs.

572
00:56:47.250 --> 00:56:48.166
Good.

573
00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:49.458
Good.

574
00:56:52.166 --> 00:56:53.333
How is she?

575
00:56:54.666 --> 00:56:55.500
Calm down.

576
00:57:01.333 --> 00:57:03.625
What's that awful smell? It's bad. right?

577
00:57:04.083 --> 00:57:05.875
Yes. I've been using a special incense.

578
00:57:05.958 --> 00:57:07.958
Shit. I'm going to vomit. It's disgusting.

579
00:57:08.041 --> 00:57:10.708
The whole house stinks.
Your daughter hasn't noticed it.

580
00:57:10.791 --> 00:57:12.208
That's the first symptom.

581
00:57:12.291 --> 00:57:16.333
I gave her rotten meat. and she ate it
without a problem. Second symptom.

582
00:57:16.416 --> 00:57:19.416
You're right. medicine won't be able
to cure your daughter.

583
00:57:19.833 --> 00:57:22.083
I analyzed her completely.
and on the surface.

584
00:57:23.041 --> 00:57:24.166
she seems to be okay.

585
00:57:24.916 --> 00:57:26.083
But it's all a facade.

586
00:57:28.416 --> 00:57:31.708
This afternoon she took a nap
and was speaking in a strange language.

587
00:57:32.291 --> 00:57:35.500
Her body is hiding blisters and marks
with very specific patterns.

588
00:57:35.583 --> 00:57:37.666
Those are her third and fourth symptoms
of possession.

589
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:41.166
And I didn't even mention the urine.
her fifth symptom. Want me to go on?

590
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.333
I've seen it before.

591
00:57:44.916 --> 00:57:46.250
She isn't your daughter anymore.

592
00:57:46.333 --> 00:57:50.500
She's a carcass that houses the Devil.
and he won't let go so easily.

593
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:55.583
You took pictures of my daughter.

594
00:57:57.083 --> 00:57:58.208
Naked.

595
00:58:01.958 --> 00:58:04.708
I'm going to need your help. Sebastián.
and it won't be easy.

596
00:58:04.791 --> 00:58:07.000
You won't like what you see down there.

597
00:58:07.083 --> 00:58:09.958
but you have to think that the person
down there isn't your daughter.

598
00:58:10.041 --> 00:58:12.000
-Fine.
-It's of the utmost importance.

599
00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:14.625
It's the key to make sure this goes well.

600
00:58:14.708 --> 00:58:15.958
What do you want me to do?

601
00:58:16.041 --> 00:58:19.166
What we're going to do is an aggression
against all the rules.

602
00:58:19.250 --> 00:58:21.250
A few sermons.
and more divine intervention.

603
00:58:21.333 --> 00:58:25.000
The devil will feel so much pain.
that he'll abandon Raquel's body.

604
00:58:25.083 --> 00:58:28.291
When he does that. he'll be weak enough
for us to destroy him.

605
00:58:28.375 --> 00:58:30.375
But the damage we do to her body.

606
00:58:30.458 --> 00:58:32.375
won't she suffer later for it?

607
00:58:35.666 --> 00:58:37.541
There's a hospital nearby.

608
00:58:38.541 --> 00:58:40.166
We're going to need this.

609
00:58:41.958 --> 00:58:43.083
Put this on.

610
00:58:45.250 --> 00:58:48.541
I'm going to highlight some paragraphs.
You'll have to read them.

611
00:58:48.625 --> 00:58:50.916
Shouldn't you be doing that?

612
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.083
I'm not a priest.

613
00:58:52.166 --> 00:58:55.166
Priest or not. it doesn't matter.
You're a Christian. right?

614
00:58:57.166 --> 00:58:59.000
-Well. yes.
-Good.

615
00:58:59.875 --> 00:59:02.500
I'm highlighting the parts
you have to read.

616
00:59:03.041 --> 00:59:05.250
I'll be busy punishing Satan.

617
00:59:12.208 --> 00:59:13.708
Don't you have Post-Its?

618
00:59:14.208 --> 00:59:15.041
What?

619
00:59:15.125 --> 00:59:18.958
Post-It. something to mark the pages.
A bookmark.

620
00:59:19.041 --> 00:59:22.791
Otherwise I'll get confused. How am I
supposed to find these? It's a lot.

621
00:59:25.833 --> 00:59:27.416
Forgive me. my Lord.

622
00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:29.250
It's for a good cause.

623
00:59:38.416 --> 00:59:39.375
Look.

624
00:59:39.916 --> 00:59:41.833
You're going to start with this one.

625
00:59:42.083 --> 00:59:43.125
then these.

626
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:45.291
and you'll finish with this one.

627
00:59:45.958 --> 00:59:48.458
Reading this will drive the demon crazy.

628
00:59:48.541 --> 00:59:52.666
That way. he won't be thinking clearly.
and that's what we want. my friend.

629
00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:56.208
Do you have  the mask
or the balaclava I asked you to bring?

630
00:59:57.541 --> 01:00:00.958
Since I left so quickly. 
I only brought what I could find.

631
01:00:02.125 --> 01:00:05.625
-And you didn't tell me what it was for.
-It's not for me. but for you.

632
01:00:06.958 --> 01:00:09.208
You're using it to conceal your identity.

633
01:00:09.916 --> 01:00:12.750
Remember when you pretended
to be an American in jail?

634
01:00:12.833 --> 01:00:14.541
-Yes. I do.
-Great.

635
01:00:15.291 --> 01:00:17.041
I need you to speak with that accent.

636
01:00:17.125 --> 01:00:19.375
The less the Devil knows about you.
the better.

637
01:00:21.333 --> 01:00:23.541
I'm going to fuck Satan.

638
01:00:32.708 --> 01:00:35.083
Shit. I can't see a thing
with this mask on.

639
01:00:35.625 --> 01:00:36.541
Silence.

640
01:00:39.666 --> 01:00:42.500
My God. Father. I don't know
if I'll be able to do it.

641
01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:05.875
Please.

642
01:01:11.583 --> 01:01:12.791
Now. read.

643
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.333
Don't hurt me. please.

644
01:01:20.833 --> 01:01:22.291
Please!

645
01:01:24.958 --> 01:01:26.375
Please!

646
01:01:27.833 --> 01:01:30.750
-"Under the protection of the Divine--"
-Accent.

647
01:01:31.291 --> 01:01:32.208
American accent.

648
01:01:37.625 --> 01:01:40.083
"Under the protection of the Divine.

649
01:01:40.333 --> 01:01:43.000
I've given them the power
to walk over serpents.

650
01:01:43.083 --> 01:01:45.458
to defeat the forces of the enemy."

651
01:01:45.833 --> 01:01:47.416
You're my Lord. my refuge.

652
01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:51.041
"You. that live protected by the Divine.
tell the Lord:

653
01:01:51.125 --> 01:01:54.208
My refuge and my bastion. my God.
in whom I trust."

654
01:01:54.291 --> 01:01:56.541
-Don't hurt me.
-You're my Lord. my refuge.

655
01:01:56.625 --> 01:02:01.166
"He will free you from the nets
of the hunter and the pestilence.

656
01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:05.208
You will not fear the terrors
of the night. or the arrow during the day.

657
01:02:05.291 --> 01:02:07.708
or the pestilence that stalks
in the shadows."

658
01:02:07.791 --> 01:02:10.750
-You're my Lord. my refuge.
-Don't hurt me. please.

659
01:02:10.833 --> 01:02:14.125
"Even if a thousand fall to your left.
and ten thousand to your right.

660
01:02:14.208 --> 01:02:15.833
you will not be touched:

661
01:02:15.958 --> 01:02:18.166
his arm is a shield and armor."

662
01:02:18.250 --> 01:02:20.500
-Please!
-You're my Lord. my refuge.

663
01:02:20.583 --> 01:02:23.708
"No evil will reach you. 
because you made the Lord your refuge

664
01:02:23.791 --> 01:02:26.291
and the Divine is your defense."

665
01:02:26.375 --> 01:02:28.000
You're my Lord. my refuge.

666
01:02:28.375 --> 01:02:31.041
"They will take you in their hands.

667
01:02:31.125 --> 01:02:33.416
so you never trip on any rock;

668
01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:36.333
you will walk over lions and serpents."

669
01:02:36.666 --> 01:02:38.666
You're my Lord. my refuge.

670
01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:43.875
"He gave himself to me. 
for that. I will glorify him.

671
01:02:43.958 --> 01:02:46.916
I will protect him.
because he knows my name.

672
01:02:47.625 --> 01:02:49.875
he will call for me. and I will answer.

673
01:02:49.958 --> 01:02:54.125
I will be with him during dangers.
I will defend him and glorify him."

674
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Abandon Raquel's body.

675
01:02:58.333 --> 01:03:01.875
"He will enjoy a long life
and he will see my salvation."

676
01:03:01.958 --> 01:03:03.875
You are my Lord. my refuge.

677
01:03:16.333 --> 01:03:19.208
"Glory be to the Father. and to the Son.
and to the Holy Spirit;

678
01:03:19.291 --> 01:03:22.541
as it was in the beginning.
is now. and will be forever. Amen."

679
01:03:22.625 --> 01:03:24.125
You are my Lord. my refuge.

680
01:03:26.708 --> 01:03:28.916
This one is done. Shall I continue?

681
01:03:29.333 --> 01:03:30.250
No. wait.

682
01:03:31.333 --> 01:03:33.416
I think our friend wants to say something.

683
01:03:41.166 --> 01:03:43.666
Stop. please.

684
01:03:46.083 --> 01:03:47.125
Help me.

685
01:03:47.416 --> 01:03:49.541
Talk to me. and only to me.

686
01:03:52.958 --> 01:03:54.750
You're crazy.

687
01:03:56.416 --> 01:03:58.875
Don't hit me anymore. please.

688
01:03:59.166 --> 01:04:01.500
Are you going to abandon this body
that isn't yours?

689
01:04:01.916 --> 01:04:03.916
How am I supposed to do that?

690
01:04:14.708 --> 01:04:15.625
Read.

691
01:04:20.916 --> 01:04:24.541
"In the beginning was the Word.
and the Word was with God.

692
01:04:24.625 --> 01:04:27.750
and the Word was God.
The same was in the beginning with God.

693
01:04:32.458 --> 01:04:35.083
All things came into being through him.

694
01:04:35.166 --> 01:04:37.375
and without him
not one thing came into being.

695
01:04:37.458 --> 01:04:39.375
What has come into being in him was life.

696
01:04:39.458 --> 01:04:42.291
and the life
was the light of all people..."

697
01:04:42.375 --> 01:04:45.500
-Son of a fucking bitch!
-"The light shines in the darkness."

698
01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:48.291
-Get me out!
-"He himself was not the light.

699
01:04:48.375 --> 01:04:51.291
but he came to testify to the light.
The true light.

700
01:04:51.375 --> 01:04:53.916
which enlightens everyone.
was coming into the world."

701
01:05:04.916 --> 01:05:07.291
-Continue reading. please.
-But Father. my daughter.

702
01:05:07.375 --> 01:05:09.958
"...as of a father’s only son.
full of grace and truth."

703
01:05:10.041 --> 01:05:12.416
If I tell you to read. you read.
Understood?

704
01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:14.875
-Yes. but--
-No buts!

705
01:05:14.958 --> 01:05:17.375
I told you before.
She's not your daughter anymore.

706
01:05:19.125 --> 01:05:21.666
Are you sure? How can you be so sure?

707
01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:25.166
What if she's my daughter
and you're mutilating her with my help?

708
01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:28.833
Do you see the drawings on the floor?
Under Raquel? Do you see them?

709
01:05:28.916 --> 01:05:31.958
Those keep the Devil active.
never passive.

710
01:05:32.041 --> 01:05:33.958
Your daughter isn't there. believe me.

711
01:05:34.375 --> 01:05:36.083
Okay. okay.

712
01:05:36.333 --> 01:05:38.375
But Father. please. take it easy on her.

713
01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:40.166
What are you doing?

714
01:05:40.541 --> 01:05:41.416
Listen to me.

715
01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:44.541
If you don't do as I say. he will take
full possession of your daughter.

716
01:05:44.625 --> 01:05:47.291
He will devour her soul
the moment he gets the chance.

717
01:05:47.375 --> 01:05:50.416
he will inject his poison
and spread it throughout your body.

718
01:05:50.791 --> 01:05:53.083
You. You already smell like him.

719
01:05:53.166 --> 01:05:57.500
I noticed it yesterday when you came.
He won't leave until we end him.

720
01:05:57.666 --> 01:05:59.208
And I know how to do it.

721
01:05:59.750 --> 01:06:02.416
Believe me. it's my curse.

722
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.625
Listen well. Sebas.
Our souls are at stake.

723
01:06:06.958 --> 01:06:10.625
And you won't know what you have
until you lose it.

724
01:06:10.708 --> 01:06:11.583
Dad?

725
01:06:17.416 --> 01:06:18.375
Dad?

726
01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:21.833
I knew it was you.

727
01:06:22.041 --> 01:06:23.083
Dad...

728
01:06:23.666 --> 01:06:24.500
Let's go.

729
01:06:28.208 --> 01:06:29.958
I'm sorry. sweetie.

730
01:06:31.875 --> 01:06:33.250
You don't need this anymore.

731
01:06:33.833 --> 01:06:35.000
She knows who you are.

732
01:06:42.416 --> 01:06:43.666
Read this here.

733
01:06:54.958 --> 01:06:56.375
What are you going to do?

734
01:06:58.625 --> 01:07:00.125
Leave. and I'll stop.

735
01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:10.916
"Thy will be done. Lord. over us.
the way everyone expects you to."

736
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:11.958
Lord. have mercy.

737
01:07:17.666 --> 01:07:19.750
My daughter. for fuck's...

738
01:07:24.916 --> 01:07:28.708
"Send your Holy Spirit..." Shit!

739
01:07:29.250 --> 01:07:32.833
"And things will be created.
and you'll renovate the earth."

740
01:07:32.916 --> 01:07:34.416
Lord. have mercy.

741
01:07:46.875 --> 01:07:49.500
Abandon this body.
servant of the Devil.

742
01:07:49.583 --> 01:07:53.250
My daughter. "And in my poor soul.
there will be nothing more."

743
01:07:55.541 --> 01:07:57.208
Lord. have mercy!

744
01:07:58.708 --> 01:08:01.250
For fuck's sake!

745
01:08:02.125 --> 01:08:03.541
This isn't right!

746
01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:06.708
This isn't right. you son of a bitch!

747
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.208
You're killing my baby!

748
01:08:09.291 --> 01:08:13.750
And I was helping you do it.
you son of a bitch!

749
01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:16.375
This is all a bunch of bullshit!

750
01:08:16.583 --> 01:08:19.125
This is fucked!

751
01:08:32.791 --> 01:08:34.791
I'm sorry. sweetie.

752
01:08:39.166 --> 01:08:41.708
-I'm sorry. please.
-Take me.

753
01:08:50.375 --> 01:08:52.041
I'm sorry. honey.

754
01:09:03.875 --> 01:09:05.208
The eyes.

755
01:09:06.583 --> 01:09:07.833
Those eyes.

756
01:09:19.416 --> 01:09:21.500
Thank you. Daddy.

757
01:09:40.666 --> 01:09:44.458
Do you like beating up girls?

758
01:09:45.375 --> 01:09:46.625
Menéndez.

759
01:09:49.916 --> 01:09:51.750
Protection. my Lord. protection!

760
01:09:55.375 --> 01:09:57.958
You're sick!

761
01:10:00.750 --> 01:10:02.916
I like it.

762
01:10:07.583 --> 01:10:09.416
Do you like my body?

763
01:10:18.333 --> 01:10:19.916
So delicious.

764
01:12:26.125 --> 01:12:27.708
Please.

765
01:12:28.041 --> 01:12:29.541
Officer...

766
01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:33.083
They're torturing me.

767
01:12:33.458 --> 01:12:35.333
And raping me.

768
01:12:35.875 --> 01:12:39.375
Please. come. right away.

769
01:12:45.041 --> 01:12:46.750
I have to go.

770
01:12:47.291 --> 01:12:49.250
Please. hurry.

771
01:12:57.125 --> 01:12:59.750
Good morning. Father.

772
01:13:00.333 --> 01:13:01.666
How did you sleep?

773
01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:05.208
You snore like a pig!

774
01:13:11.208 --> 01:13:14.750
It's been a very eventful day.

775
01:13:17.416 --> 01:13:18.625
We should...

776
01:13:19.166 --> 01:13:21.083
try to relax. don't you think?

777
01:13:22.875 --> 01:13:26.125
I know you're dying to do it.

778
01:13:26.666 --> 01:13:28.166
Tell me. Menéndez.

779
01:13:29.416 --> 01:13:31.333
Do you want to play?

780
01:13:32.333 --> 01:13:36.166
I've given myself to the Lord.
he knows temptation has no power over me.

781
01:13:36.250 --> 01:13:37.750
The Lord is omnipresent.

782
01:13:39.291 --> 01:13:41.166
You're impotent.

783
01:13:47.125 --> 01:13:50.125
I must admit that you surprised me.

784
01:13:50.833 --> 01:13:52.833
You haven't caved in yet.

785
01:13:54.166 --> 01:13:56.083
I always knew it was you.

786
01:13:57.958 --> 01:14:01.875
Congratulations. really!

787
01:14:03.833 --> 01:14:07.458
I thought that after so many years.
you'd be rusty.

788
01:14:08.208 --> 01:14:09.916
But you aren't.

789
01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:12.500
Tell me.

790
01:14:13.583 --> 01:14:15.458
How's Marisa?

791
01:14:16.958 --> 01:14:18.208
Her son...

792
01:14:18.708 --> 01:14:21.291
is suffering a lot with us.

793
01:14:21.416 --> 01:14:23.333
In hell.

794
01:14:23.416 --> 01:14:26.166
Her son is in heaven with the Lord!

795
01:14:40.291 --> 01:14:42.375
For fuck's sake!

796
01:14:43.791 --> 01:14:45.083
Hi. Daddy.

797
01:14:50.208 --> 01:14:53.666
Now I remember. you like to watch.

798
01:14:55.125 --> 01:14:56.750
I'll put on a show.

799
01:15:03.083 --> 01:15:04.375
What are you doing?

800
01:15:08.250 --> 01:15:11.458
Stop. please.
Oh. for crying out loud. no.

801
01:15:12.125 --> 01:15:14.500
No. No.

802
01:15:15.875 --> 01:15:18.541
Concentrate.
You can do it. Sebas. concentrate.

803
01:15:25.583 --> 01:15:26.791
Concentrate.

804
01:15:27.333 --> 01:15:30.125
Concentrate. Sebas. you can do it.
Concentrate.

805
01:15:35.916 --> 01:15:37.208
What do I do?

806
01:15:37.875 --> 01:15:41.333
Stop. please! No. this is my daughter!

807
01:15:41.416 --> 01:15:45.416
-My daughter is blowing me!
-Be strong. Sebastián!

808
01:15:54.875 --> 01:15:56.333
Dad.

809
01:15:58.875 --> 01:16:01.666
This is starting to get interesting.

810
01:16:08.250 --> 01:16:12.541
I do practice what I preach.
unlike your God.

811
01:16:15.291 --> 01:16:17.375
You're really going to like this.

812
01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:27.458
You shouldn't do these things!

813
01:16:27.666 --> 01:16:30.708
Stop. for fuck's sake! Please. stop!

814
01:16:30.791 --> 01:16:36.000
Kill me! Kill me. don't do this to me!

815
01:16:38.625 --> 01:16:40.250
I'm serious. Kill me.

816
01:16:41.333 --> 01:16:44.208
It seems they don't teach you
how to tie knots in hell!

817
01:16:48.291 --> 01:16:50.291
Shut up. you fucking priest!

818
01:16:52.666 --> 01:16:53.708
Daddy.

819
01:16:53.791 --> 01:16:57.666
Daddy. this man is doing things
to my flower.

820
01:16:58.416 --> 01:17:00.750
But don't get jealous. Daddy.

821
01:17:02.291 --> 01:17:04.708
You did it much better.

822
01:17:10.458 --> 01:17:15.833
The wolf had five little wolves.

823
01:17:18.125 --> 01:17:23.875
Five little wolves behind the broom.

824
01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:30.166
Five she raised.
and five she gave birth to.

825
01:17:30.250 --> 01:17:33.041
and to the five she gave milk--

826
01:17:35.041 --> 01:17:39.000
That's what extinguishers are for. bitch!

827
01:17:39.375 --> 01:17:40.375
You shall not kill.

828
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.791
That thing isn't my daughter.

829
01:17:44.375 --> 01:17:46.583
If you do it. you'll never get her back.

830
01:17:48.125 --> 01:17:49.416
Fuck.

831
01:17:50.291 --> 01:17:51.625
Fuck.

832
01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:53.541
My daughter.

833
01:17:54.250 --> 01:17:55.333
Help me.

834
01:17:56.083 --> 01:17:57.375
Help me.

835
01:18:15.291 --> 01:18:18.541
We'll tie up Raquel with this
and expel the demon.

836
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.250
This is fucking heavy.
Isn't a rope enough?

837
01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:24.833
These chains are from the Inquisition.

838
01:18:25.041 --> 01:18:27.166
They were used for ancestral exorcisms.

839
01:18:27.291 --> 01:18:30.208
They possess all the suffering
of all those possessed souls.

840
01:18:30.291 --> 01:18:32.458
It will torment the demon
while we finish.

841
01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:38.541
Scream now. goddamn demon!

842
01:18:50.583 --> 01:18:51.416
What's this?

843
01:18:51.791 --> 01:18:54.291
This will keep it in place
when he leaves your daughter.

844
01:18:57.250 --> 01:18:58.625
I want to finish him.

845
01:19:00.041 --> 01:19:02.375
"God. creator and defender
of the human race--"

846
01:19:02.458 --> 01:19:04.416
Not with that accent.
It knows who you are.

847
01:19:09.208 --> 01:19:11.541
"God. creator and defender
of the human race.

848
01:19:11.625 --> 01:19:14.208
look upon your servant.
Raquel Montoya.

849
01:19:14.291 --> 01:19:17.791
you created her in your image
and called her to be a part of your glory.

850
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.375
The adversary torments her cruelly.

851
01:19:23.458 --> 01:19:26.625
oppresses her with violent force.
and troubles her with cruel terror.

852
01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:32.041
Listen. Heavenly Father.
to the cries of your pleading church.

853
01:19:32.125 --> 01:19:35.916
do not allow your servant
to be possessed by the father of lies.

854
01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.708
Listen. merciful God.

855
01:19:38.916 --> 01:19:42.375
to the prayer of the blessed Virgin Mary.
whose Son.

856
01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:45.583
dying on the Cross.
crushed the head of the old serpent.

857
01:19:45.666 --> 01:19:48.291
and entrusted all men to the Mother
as her children.

858
01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:58.416
Let the light of the truth
shine over this servant of yours."

859
01:20:13.625 --> 01:20:17.333
"God of everything good.
stop this diabolical action decisively.

860
01:20:17.416 --> 01:20:20.875
Lord of freedom and grace.
untie the knots of perversion.

861
01:20:20.958 --> 01:20:24.083
Repel. O Lord. the Devil's power.
break asunder his snares and traps.

862
01:20:24.166 --> 01:20:26.541
put the unholy tempter to flight.

863
01:20:26.625 --> 01:20:29.500
Let your servant be protected
in mind and body.

864
01:20:29.625 --> 01:20:32.375
so that this servant may sincerely
and steadfastly

865
01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:35.708
render you the service which is your due.

866
01:20:35.791 --> 01:20:37.958
through Christ. our Lord."

867
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Amen.

868
01:21:17.291 --> 01:21:19.333
Pick up your daughter
and take her upstairs.

869
01:21:52.916 --> 01:21:54.791
Free Raquel. Sebastián.

870
01:22:32.625 --> 01:22:34.500
I should congratulate you. Menéndez.

871
01:22:40.416 --> 01:22:41.708
What are you playing at?

872
01:22:42.416 --> 01:22:44.291
You lost your faith a long time ago.

873
01:22:44.916 --> 01:22:47.333
My faith is intact
and stronger than ever.

874
01:22:47.791 --> 01:22:49.500
I believe in the Lord and all his glory.

875
01:22:50.250 --> 01:22:51.958
Do you believe you saved Raquel?

876
01:22:52.041 --> 01:22:55.041
I believe in Christ's strength.
and I believe in you. fallen angel.

877
01:22:55.125 --> 01:22:57.875
You're flesh of his flesh.
blood of his blood. like everyone.

878
01:22:57.958 --> 01:23:00.166
We all owe ourselves to Him.
without exception.

879
01:23:00.916 --> 01:23:02.541
You did not save my son.

880
01:23:03.208 --> 01:23:05.833
He suffered in life.
and now he suffers in hell.

881
01:23:06.083 --> 01:23:08.291
You should've spent more time in jail.

882
01:23:09.208 --> 01:23:10.750
Did you like hurting him?

883
01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.208
Did you get excited?

884
01:23:12.541 --> 01:23:15.833
I order you to materialize.
I tie you to the terrestrial plane.

885
01:23:15.916 --> 01:23:18.958
Suffer the consequences
in your corrupt. evil soul.

886
01:23:21.208 --> 01:23:23.583
Did it excite you to hit my daughter?

887
01:23:24.375 --> 01:23:26.250
You're a pervert.

888
01:23:26.666 --> 01:23:28.916
No one should trust you.

889
01:23:29.333 --> 01:23:31.416
In the name of the Father.
I ask that your sins

890
01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:33.291
solidify in haggard flesh.

891
01:23:33.375 --> 01:23:35.875
By the Grace of God.
let your heart pump the blood

892
01:23:35.958 --> 01:23:38.333
that you stole from the souls
you tormented!

893
01:23:41.666 --> 01:23:43.208
You're sick.
