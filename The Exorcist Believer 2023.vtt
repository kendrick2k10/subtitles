Oh. madame...

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:40.642
No. no.
- It's beautiful! Mwah!

5
00:01:40.642 --> 00:01:43.437
- It's beautiful.
- You are beautiful.

6
00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:45.772
- God bless you.

7
00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:47.858
Ah. no...

8
00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:58.201
Excuse me.

9
00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:00.329
Excuse me. miss.

10
00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:03.081
I show you something special.

11
00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:05.459
And blessing for your baby.

12
00:02:52.047 --> 00:02:54.174
I like your necklace.

13
00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:56.009
You like my bracelet?

14
00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.511
My grandma gave it to me.

15
00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:01.807
- I like it.
- Yay.

16
00:03:01.807 --> 00:03:03.392
Hey. nice lady.

17
00:03:03.392 --> 00:03:04.518
Mm-hmm.

18
00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:07.187
Your English is very good.

19
00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:08.855
- The pretty lady.
- Hello.

20
00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:10.607
The pretty lady.

21
00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:18.532
- Ooh!

22
00:03:18.532 --> 00:03:19.533
Hello.

23
00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:22.702
How are you?

24
00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:24.246
- Bien.
- Bien?

25
00:03:24.246 --> 00:03:25.956
- Ah.
Take your picture?

26
00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.380
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

27
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.048
She's cute.

28
00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:36.550
You all right?

29
00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:39.636
What's going on?

30
00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:43.223
I met this woman today
at the market

31
00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:46.101
who gave me the most beautiful

32
00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:49.813
blessing of protection
for Angela.

33
00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:51.356
Hmm.

34
00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:53.275
So you actually believe
in all that?

35
00:03:53.275 --> 00:03:54.693
Yes.

36
00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:09.332
- Oh. my God.
- It's beautiful.

37
00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:14.838
Jesus. cover this place
with your love.

38
00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:17.132
God.

39
00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:19.801
Whew.

40
00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:24.181
You think they'll let me
go up in the bell tower

41
00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:26.099
and take a shot
of the whole city? -Mm.

42
00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.601
What you think?

43
00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:29.060
- Go for it.
- Let's go.

44
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.896
No. baby. my feet hurt.

45
00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:35.442
We should go back.

46
00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:37.194
No. you go ahead.
go get the shot.

47
00:04:37.194 --> 00:04:39.112
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

48
00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.322
All right. I love you.

49
00:04:40.322 --> 00:04:42.032
I love you.

50
00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:19.588
Sorenne!

51
00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:29.681
Protect her.

52
00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:00.962
You don't... I-I...
I speak English.

53
00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:03.757
He's saying that your wife has
serious injuries.

54
00:07:03.757 --> 00:07:08.053
Anything we do to keep her
alive will endanger your child.

55
00:07:08.053 --> 00:07:09.929
Your baby.

56
00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:12.807
- I don't understand.

57
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.685
It's a difficult choice.

58
00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:18.021
We cannot save them both.

59
00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:21.524
We are so sorry.

60
00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:17.831
Angela?

61
00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:20.834
Got to get a move on.

62
00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:22.752
Ange.

63
00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:26.214
20 minutes.

64
00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:30.468
All right.

65
00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:32.887
Hurry up
and finish your breakfast.

66
00:08:32.887 --> 00:08:35.181
- Slept in past my alarm.
- You can have it.

67
00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:37.183
You eat it.
I'm not eating meat anymore.

68
00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:38.643
Talking about?

69
00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:40.019
Oh. it's that documentary
you watched. right?

70
00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:41.646
Gave you bad dreams
like I told you it would?

71
00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:43.231
Poor little piggies.
I mean. think about it.

72
00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:45.567
You're just enjoying your day
chilling in a mud bath.

73
00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:47.360
and then...

74
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.987
And then...

75
00:08:48.987 --> 00:08:51.740
All 'cause some farmer
got sick of eating oatmeal.

76
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.616
So. ice cream for breakfast.

77
00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:54.993
Fine with me.

78
00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:56.786
You got that math thing today. right?

79
00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:58.204
Math Champ Challenge.
It's tomorrow.

80
00:08:58.204 --> 00:08:59.539
Don't bite your nails.

81
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:02.250
Um. I was wondering

82
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.711
if I could do homework
at Katherine's today?

83
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:06.671
Like. go home with her?
Her dad can bring me home.

84
00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:08.673
Well. I was thinking that

85
00:09:08.673 --> 00:09:10.383
we could just do
what we always do.

86
00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:12.302
You know. I come get you after
school. you come to the studio.

87
00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:14.095
do your homework. we spend
time together... -Yeah. I know.

88
00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:15.597
- That's-that's what I'm asking.
- ...which we never do.

89
00:09:15.597 --> 00:09:16.848
That's what I'm saying.

90
00:09:16.848 --> 00:09:18.808
I mean. I do have friends.
you know.

91
00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:20.226
Yeah. I know you have friends.

92
00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:22.729
You know. b-but what I'm saying
is. like...

93
00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:25.231
- Poor little piggies!
- ...I'm your friend.

94
00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:27.734
Angela.
we don't have time for this.

95
00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:30.737
Very sweet.

96
00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:33.573
Very funny.

97
00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:36.576
- Somebody sees one documentary.

98
00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:41.164
You know. it's very mature.

99
00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:46.085
Angela.

100
00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:47.420
Damn it.

101
00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.088
Ange.

102
00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:55.762
Okay.

103
00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:57.972
We're doing this.

104
00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:01.726
Angela Renée Fielding.

105
00:10:02.727 --> 00:10:05.271
This is not a game.

106
00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:07.482
It's time to go now.

107
00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:09.275
Right now.

108
00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:19.077
Aha! Yeah. yeah!

109
00:10:19.077 --> 00:10:19.953
Stop. Fine. fine.

110
00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:21.788
- The master!
- Yeah. eat this.

111
00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:23.206
Enjoy the taste of your poor.
defenseless little animal.

112
00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:24.916
- Please. Please.
- I will. I will enjoy the taste

113
00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:27.293
of this poor. defenseless
animal. -

114
00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:28.920
Hey. Angela!

115
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.464
Tell your dad
I'll meet him at the gym.

116
00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:32.549
You got it. Mr. Mullen.

117
00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:34.634
You can tell him yourself.

118
00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:36.469
Hey. what's up?

119
00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:38.555
- Hey.
- What?

120
00:10:38.555 --> 00:10:40.306
- Where'd you get this?
- Oh. I. um.

121
00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:42.767
got it at the store
with my allowance.

122
00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:45.562
Don't lie to me now.

123
00:10:45.562 --> 00:10:47.146
I found it with Mom's stuff.

124
00:10:47.146 --> 00:10:48.898
- Just thought it was nice.
- Your mom's stuff?

125
00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:50.900
Or through your dad's stuff?
'Cause I think I remember

126
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.236
- where I put it.
Hey. Mr. Fielding.

127
00:10:53.236 --> 00:10:54.946
Mr. Fielding.
you're going to leave

128
00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:57.240
your trash cans
out here all week?

129
00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.492
You just take the cans.

130
00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:01.160
and you drag 'em
down your driveway.

131
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.580
- Nice to see you. too.
- Try being a neighbor.

132
00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.373
Forgot to bring 'em in. huh?

133
00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:06.833
It was your turn.

134
00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:09.085
I do first and third Tues...

135
00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:11.921
I'm-I'm sorry. okay?

136
00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:13.673
- I'm sorry.
- Ah. leave 'em.

137
00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:16.050
- She could use the excitement.

138
00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:32.817
Shut up. okay?

139
00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:35.028
Do not park... Oh. my gosh.

140
00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:37.363
One sec.

141
00:11:37.363 --> 00:11:39.282
Can't park there.
That's a bus lane. -One second.

142
00:11:39.282 --> 00:11:41.367
Come on! -HANNAH: Katherine's
wearing flip-flops to school?

143
00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:42.702
Give that back!

144
00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:44.078
- Hey. that's mine!
Flip-flops?

145
00:11:44.078 --> 00:11:45.622
Katherine. what happened
to your new shoes?

146
00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:46.873
Tyler colored on them
with Magic Marker.

147
00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:48.333
Not today. guys. Not today.

148
00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:50.168
You said they gave you
blisters. -Shut up!

149
00:11:50.168 --> 00:11:52.045
Don't tell your sister
to shut up. -Okay. I got to go.

150
00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:53.963
Bye. Mom. Bye. Dad. -She's got
something on her lips. Hey.

151
00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:55.381
You're stepping on my
backpack! Hands off! Get off!

152
00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:57.008
I want it off.
- You're embarrassing me.

153
00:11:57.008 --> 00:11:58.718
You call us when you get
to Deshannah's. -I will.

154
00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.470
- Promise me. Promise me.
- I will!

155
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.388
- Promise.

156
00:12:02.388 --> 00:12:04.140
I shouldn't have snapped
at you. -Can't park there!

157
00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.850
- One sec. One second.
- That...

158
00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:08.311
- It's a fire lane.
- One sec. Hey.

159
00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:10.396
It's just. you know.
Mom's stuff is...

160
00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:12.357
It's precious.

161
00:12:14.692 --> 00:12:16.319
You be home by dinner.

162
00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:21.115

"Nameless here for evermore..."

A séance?

173
00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:40.009
Just tell them that we're
doing homework. all right?

174
00:12:40.009 --> 00:12:41.928
My dad agreed.
so don't worry about it.

175
00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:43.930
I don't think he's gonna
call Miranda. -STUDENT: Shh!

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.517
Quiet!

177
00:12:47.517 --> 00:12:48.935

181
00:12:54.023 --> 00:12:55.942

- This it is and nothing more.'"
- Shh!

184
00:12:59.737 --> 00:13:02.323
What if they call?

185
00:13:02.323 --> 00:13:04.200
They're not gonna.

186
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.160
What if they do?

187
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.787
Tell them we were just
doing homework.

188
00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:09.455
and then we. like.
just left for home.

189
00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:10.581
Okay? Say. "For home."

190
00:13:10.581 --> 00:13:13.084
What did I say?!

191
00:13:13.084 --> 00:13:16.295
One. two! One. one. two!

192
00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:18.339
One. one. two!

193
00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:19.549
One. two!

194
00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:21.050
You got to suck the air
out of your teeth.

195
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.343
It's a thing. right?

196
00:13:22.343 --> 00:13:24.303
One. two! One. one. two!

197
00:13:24.303 --> 00:13:26.639
What you got going on
this weekend?

198
00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:29.475
Angie's got a soccer thing
all day Saturday. You?

199
00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:32.311
My church is having
a pancake lunch on Sunday.

200
00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:33.646
You can both come.

201
00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:34.939
Some of us get
a little freaked out

202
00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:36.566
when people start
speaking in tongues.

203
00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:42.697
Okay. Exactly.

204
00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:45.950
And so. my dad's not gonna call
'cause he's going to the. um...

205
00:13:54.709 --> 00:13:56.169
What are we doing?

206
00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:57.837
"What are we doing?"
This is your idea.

207
00:13:57.837 --> 00:13:59.964
You know something's out there.

208
00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:08.598
You think I'm crazy. don't you?

209
00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:10.433
We light the candle
and hold the pendulum

210
00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:12.727
and ask the spirit
yes-or-no questions

211
00:14:12.727 --> 00:14:15.188
about angels and demons
and devils

212
00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:17.273
and pastors and saints.

213
00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:19.192
And lions and tigers
and bears and...

214
00:14:19.192 --> 00:14:20.735
Shut up.

215
00:14:20.735 --> 00:14:22.278
Watch this.

216
00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:24.697
Uh... (laughing): Okay.
what are you. insane?

217
00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:26.365
- Whoo!
- Excuse you.

218
00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:29.869
You can light your own candles.

219
00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:32.121
Get your sticks
and rub them together

220
00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:34.082
like you did at camp.

221
00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:46.552
- Boo!

222
00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:50.223
It's been a while. Yeah.

223
00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:51.641
- All right. here we go.
Nice and tall. Whoo!

224
00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:53.101
Come on. buddy.
That's not bad.

225
00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:54.352
Let's smile.
Okay.

226
00:14:54.352 --> 00:14:56.229
That's not bad at all.
Ah. there we go.

227
00:14:56.229 --> 00:14:57.855
I like this. but I also think

228
00:14:57.855 --> 00:14:59.232
have the kids in the middle...

229
00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:00.983
Do you want...
Do you want her and then him?

230
00:15:00.983 --> 00:15:02.235
Let's get you guys
closer together.

231
00:15:02.235 --> 00:15:03.736
Can we get...
get a little closer?

232
00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:05.029
Come on. honey.
Come on.

233
00:15:05.029 --> 00:15:06.322
Get you right in the front.

234
00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:08.282
- Hang you upside down?
- Yeah.

235
00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:10.868
Where's Dad? Everybody!

236
00:15:10.868 --> 00:15:12.078
- Come right here.
- Come back.

237
00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:14.080
Smile.
- I am!

238
00:15:15.289 --> 00:15:16.582
I'm gonna teach you
how to be a man.

239
00:15:16.582 --> 00:15:17.750
I-I'm getting good stuff.

240
00:15:19.252 --> 00:15:20.711
I'm gonna count to three.

241
00:15:20.711 --> 00:15:22.421
One. two...

242
00:15:28.302 --> 00:15:30.263
You light a candle

243
00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:34.058
and just clear your mind.

244
00:15:35.143 --> 00:15:38.187
Just start speaking
what she says to you.

245
00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:47.071
Okay.

246
00:15:48.698 --> 00:15:50.908
Angela.

247
00:15:50.908 --> 00:15:52.785
- Angela.
-  Katherine.

248
00:15:52.785 --> 00:15:54.954
- That's so creepy.

249
00:16:51.594 --> 00:16:53.721
Come on.

250
00:17:03.731 --> 00:17:05.399
Ange?

251
00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:08.027
You asleep?

252
00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:21.040
Ange?

253
00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:31.175
ANGELA
Hey. it's Angela.

254
00:17:31.175 --> 00:17:32.969
I don't check this. so text me.

255
00:17:32.969 --> 00:17:34.470
Bye.

256
00:17:47.316 --> 00:17:48.567
Hello?

257
00:17:48.567 --> 00:17:50.111
Hi. Hey. This is. um...

258
00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:51.654
This is Victor Fielding.
Angela's dad.

259
00:17:51.654 --> 00:17:53.739
She said she was coming over
to Katherine's house

260
00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:55.825
to do homework this afternoon.

261
00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:57.743
- I was just... was looking...
No.

262
00:17:57.743 --> 00:17:59.495
- Are they still...
- Uh. Katherine told me

263
00:17:59.495 --> 00:18:02.206
she was going over to study
at Deshannah's house.

264
00:18:02.206 --> 00:18:03.541
I'm sorry. who is that?

265
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:05.209
Deshannah Young?
A friend of Katherine's.

266
00:18:05.209 --> 00:18:07.086
She told me they were gonna go
over there and study.

267
00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:08.462
- They're there?
- Maybe Angela's with them?

268
00:18:08.462 --> 00:18:10.506
The girls are at
Deshannah's house?

269
00:18:10.506 --> 00:18:11.966
Yeah. you know. maybe
they're studying together.

270
00:18:11.966 --> 00:18:13.592
Let me give her mom a try.

271
00:18:13.592 --> 00:18:16.262
Okay. give me a call back
if you... if you don't mind.

272
00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:18.264
- Yep.
- Thanks.

273
00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:26.314
Hold on just a second.
It's Deshannah.

274
00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:28.607
Do you know where
they were going?

275
00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:30.860
I don't know
where they were going.

276
00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.111
They just wanted me to say

277
00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:33.904
they were here
in case anyone called.

278
00:18:33.904 --> 00:18:37.283
Well. did you see them together
or did you see where they went?

279
00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:39.285
This is. uh... this is Tony.
I'm Katherine's father.

280
00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:42.496
Did-did you see them
get in a car with anybody?

281
00:18:42.496 --> 00:18:44.290
They were just walking.

282
00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:46.625
Walked away.
walked into the woods.

283
00:18:47.418 --> 00:18:49.462
I'm getting my coat.

284
00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:55.468
- Katherine!
- Katherine!

285
00:18:55.468 --> 00:18:57.136
Angela!

286
00:19:02.224 --> 00:19:03.642
Katherine!

287
00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:09.273
Where are the police?

288
00:19:09.273 --> 00:19:10.483
They said they'd be here soon.

289
00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:12.318
- Katherine!
- Katherine!

290
00:19:14.236 --> 00:19:16.697
- Angela!
Katherine!

291
00:19:19.033 --> 00:19:20.785
Why did...

292
00:19:20.785 --> 00:19:22.161
All right. they're on
their way. See. that's them.

293
00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:23.412
- They're getting here.
- Okay.

294
00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:32.671
Honey. it's Mom and Dad!

295
00:19:37.676 --> 00:19:39.845
Katherine!

296
00:19:45.226 --> 00:19:47.436
Katherine!

297
00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:50.773
Angela?

298
00:19:51.982 --> 00:19:53.859
Katherine!

299
00:20:07.957 --> 00:20:10.042
Tony!

300
00:20:10.042 --> 00:20:12.002
- Katherine!
Miranda!

301
00:20:12.002 --> 00:20:13.546
They've been here.

302
00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:15.965
They've been here.
She's been here.

303
00:21:11.395 --> 00:21:13.772
And here are your daughters.

304
00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.109
Angela and Katherine.

305
00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:19.111
They depart campus after school.

306
00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:22.406
They proceed at 2:45.

307
00:21:22.406 --> 00:21:24.617
That's about seven hours ago.

308
00:21:24.617 --> 00:21:26.702
And that's the last
information we have.

309
00:21:26.702 --> 00:21:29.288
- We found their shoes...
- No. we found their shoes.

310
00:21:29.288 --> 00:21:30.664
- But no footprints.

311
00:21:30.664 --> 00:21:32.958
What about that
homeless camp out there?

312
00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:34.627
Someone...

313
00:21:34.627 --> 00:21:36.295
Somebody is living out there.
There are people out there.

314
00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:37.838
There's got to be
somebody that knows.

315
00:21:37.838 --> 00:21:39.465
I understand. There is
a transient community...

316
00:21:39.465 --> 00:21:40.883
Transient community?
Yes.

317
00:21:40.883 --> 00:21:42.343
Is that what you call
a bunch of fucking bums?

318
00:21:42.343 --> 00:21:44.428
So far.
the interviews with them

319
00:21:44.428 --> 00:21:46.096
do not indicate
any connection...

320
00:21:46.096 --> 00:21:47.640
That's shocking. Shocking.

321
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.350
Is there anything else going on
with your daughter...

322
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:51.477
We are looking
into every option.

323
00:21:51.477 --> 00:21:53.062
...that we should know?

324
00:21:53.062 --> 00:21:54.313
Pardon me?

325
00:21:54.313 --> 00:21:55.814
That you haven't told us?

326
00:21:55.814 --> 00:21:57.399
To be honest with you. sir.
I didn't even know

327
00:21:57.399 --> 00:21:58.901
our daughter was friends
with your daughter.

328
00:21:58.901 --> 00:22:00.611
Katherine is a free spirit.
She is a popular kid.

329
00:22:00.611 --> 00:22:02.154
- She is well liked.
- If I did. this would not be

330
00:22:02.154 --> 00:22:03.989
the first time we were meeting.
I promise you that.

331
00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:05.658
She is a-a youth group leader
at our church. ma'am.

332
00:22:05.658 --> 00:22:07.660
No. 'cause...
'cause what I'm saying is.

333
00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:12.414
my daughter and I are...
we're connected. close.

334
00:22:12.414 --> 00:22:14.250
She doesn't do
all the activities

335
00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.043
like the free spirit.
so I don't know.

336
00:22:16.043 --> 00:22:17.753
I'm just saying sometimes
there's things we don't know.

337
00:22:17.753 --> 00:22:19.213
Well. I don't know you.
you know?

338
00:22:19.213 --> 00:22:20.673
Sometimes there's things.

339
00:22:20.673 --> 00:22:22.341
as parents. we don't know.

340
00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:23.884
- We don't know you!
- What you know about me

341
00:22:23.884 --> 00:22:25.678
is that the only thing
that's ever mattered

342
00:22:25.678 --> 00:22:27.388
is protecting my kid.
That's what you know about me.

343
00:22:27.388 --> 00:22:28.681
Well. then. where are they?

344
00:22:28.681 --> 00:22:30.349
- Okay.

345
00:22:30.349 --> 00:22:31.892
Okay. it's okay. it's okay.

346
00:22:31.892 --> 00:22:33.519
Where could they be?
- Hey. Listen up. Okay.

347
00:22:33.519 --> 00:22:35.062
That's what
we need to worry about.

348
00:22:35.062 --> 00:22:37.356
I know you're all upset.

349
00:22:38.482 --> 00:22:40.734
I know you're all stressed.

350
00:22:40.734 --> 00:22:42.695
The good news is
they left together.

351
00:22:42.695 --> 00:22:46.282
Statistically. it's likely your
girls are just out being girls.

352
00:22:46.282 --> 00:22:50.703
We need to recognize that
we all have a common goal here.

353
00:22:50.703 --> 00:22:53.539
Let's get your girls home safe.

354
00:22:54.456 --> 00:22:57.126
Let's do that. Right now.

355
00:23:10.848 --> 00:23:12.600
All the surrounding counties

356
00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.851
- should be looped in.
Excuse me. Mr. Officer.

357
00:23:13.851 --> 00:23:15.728
Don't act like
you don't know me.

358
00:23:15.728 --> 00:23:17.521
See if they can increase
their patrols in the area...

359
00:23:17.521 --> 00:23:19.607
My name is Mark Garbage.
Mr. Garbage.

360
00:23:19.607 --> 00:23:21.150
Don't steal my stuff.

361
00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:22.901
We're just asking
questions. all right?

362
00:23:22.901 --> 00:23:24.737
Asking if you've seen anything.

363
00:23:24.737 --> 00:23:26.655
trying to figure out
who might have seen something.

364
00:23:26.655 --> 00:23:28.407
You don't know nothing.

365
00:23:28.407 --> 00:23:29.867
We weren't looking or nothing.

366
00:23:29.867 --> 00:23:32.119
- Just out here doing nothing.

367
00:23:40.419 --> 00:23:41.754
"The jaws that bite.

368
00:23:41.754 --> 00:23:43.422
"the claws that catch!

369
00:23:43.422 --> 00:23:45.382
"Beware the Jubjub bird.

00:23:45.382 --> 00:23:47.301

00:23:52.097 --> 00:23:54.099

00:23:54.099 --> 00:23:55.392
"And stood awhile in thought.

00:23:55.392 --> 00:23:57.853

384
00:24:18.123 --> 00:24:20.000
I'm joined now
by the pastor of the church

385
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.503
and the mother of one
of the missing girls.

386
00:24:22.503 --> 00:24:24.630
How are you holding up?

387
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:27.549
If she's out there
and she can hear this.

388
00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:29.551
please come home.

389
00:24:29.551 --> 00:24:32.721
We're praying for Katherine
and her friend Angela.

390
00:24:32.721 --> 00:24:35.641
And Angela's father.
who's suffering along...

391
00:24:42.981 --> 00:24:44.775
I know you said
you didn't see her.

392
00:24:44.775 --> 00:24:47.736
but did you see any other kids
out there in the woods?

393
00:24:47.736 --> 00:24:49.446
There's kids.

394
00:24:49.446 --> 00:24:51.657
Yeah. that's what I'm...

395
00:24:51.657 --> 00:24:54.451
- Tell me about them.

396
00:24:54.451 --> 00:24:56.036
Kids come out there.

397
00:24:56.036 --> 00:24:59.832
You know. the ones. uh.
that got no place to be.

398
00:25:02.918 --> 00:25:05.504
- There's other kids. too.

399
00:25:05.504 --> 00:25:08.716
Kids that don't want to be
told what to do.

400
00:25:08.716 --> 00:25:11.593
Kids that don't want to go home.

401
00:25:11.593 --> 00:25:14.555
even though they got good ones.

402
00:25:14.555 --> 00:25:16.473
Run off looking for things.

403
00:25:16.473 --> 00:25:18.183
Doing things ought not be done.

404
00:25:18.183 --> 00:25:21.520
No. no. that's not...
that's not my kid.

405
00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.732
Maybe a kid like that.
she don't find her mama.

406
00:25:24.732 --> 00:25:26.525
Mommy. Mommy.

407
00:25:26.525 --> 00:25:29.111
Mommy!

408
00:25:29.111 --> 00:25:31.697
Maybe. uh. find
something else instead.

409
00:25:31.697 --> 00:25:33.699
Mommy. Mommy.

410
00:26:26.293 --> 00:26:27.961
Hello?

411
00:26:45.771 --> 00:26:48.273
Hey. Victor.
Oh. good. you're home.

412
00:26:48.273 --> 00:26:50.609
This is my friend Dr. Beehibe.

413
00:26:55.447 --> 00:26:57.866
It's okay. It's...
Uh. they're-they're with me.

414
00:26:57.866 --> 00:26:59.618
It's the...
This is a good thing.

415
00:26:59.618 --> 00:27:01.620
- This is...
Is Angela here?

416
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.163
No. she's not here.
This is Dr. Beehibe.

417
00:27:03.163 --> 00:27:04.957
- Is Angela here?
- No. no. she's not here.

418
00:27:04.957 --> 00:27:06.208
- This is my friend Dr. Beehibe.
- We're doing a blessing.

419
00:27:06.208 --> 00:27:07.459
We are bringing her back.

420
00:27:07.459 --> 00:27:08.961
We want to bring her back protected.

421
00:27:08.961 --> 00:27:10.629
- This is... This is okay.
- We want her to come back.

422
00:27:10.629 --> 00:27:12.005
She's doing
a blessing on her room.

423
00:27:12.005 --> 00:27:14.299
That-that's all.
just-just to keep Angela safe.

424
00:27:14.299 --> 00:27:15.968
I need you to get everybody out.

425
00:27:15.968 --> 00:27:17.469
Uh. ladies. come on.

426
00:27:17.469 --> 00:27:19.221
Faster. Stu.
- Come on.

427
00:27:19.221 --> 00:27:21.014
Come on.

428
00:27:23.016 --> 00:27:25.018
Hey. pal. I was just
trying to help.

429
00:27:25.018 --> 00:27:27.187
- Get the fuck out.
- Okay.

430
00:28:01.513 --> 00:28:04.057
When my sister was sick...

431
00:28:04.975 --> 00:28:07.227
...and we did all we could...

432
00:28:09.354 --> 00:28:10.939
...for her to find relief.

433
00:28:10.939 --> 00:28:13.859
she had to go outside

434
00:28:13.859 --> 00:28:16.653
of her belief system.
outside of my beliefs.

435
00:28:18.405 --> 00:28:19.781
We're your neighbors.

436
00:28:19.781 --> 00:28:22.534
And we just want
to be there for you

437
00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:25.120
and-and do anything that we can.

438
00:28:29.791 --> 00:28:32.377
She doesn't have her raincoat.

439
00:28:32.377 --> 00:28:35.005
Dad. Dad. she has the fever!

440
00:28:35.005 --> 00:28:36.757
I just come out
and she went down!

441
00:28:36.757 --> 00:28:39.009
Hurry and get the kit.
I'll call Dr. Bethero.

442
00:28:39.009 --> 00:28:41.553
The tub and the mat.
Bring me the whole thing.

443
00:28:41.553 --> 00:28:43.764
- Okay. Okay.
- Hurry and get the kit.

444
00:28:43.764 --> 00:28:45.515
- Bring a blanket.
- Yeah.

445
00:28:45.515 --> 00:28:46.683
Bring a blanket. too.

446
00:28:46.683 --> 00:28:48.060
Blanket.

447
00:29:42.698 --> 00:29:44.449
Dad?

448
00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:46.702
Where are we?

449
00:29:46.702 --> 00:29:48.537
Dad!

450
00:30:02.634 --> 00:30:04.136
Hey.

451
00:30:04.136 --> 00:30:05.679
- Where is she? She's this way?
- She's just admitted.

452
00:30:05.679 --> 00:30:07.014
Come here.

453
00:30:09.266 --> 00:30:11.143
You are not...
You are not in trouble.

454
00:30:11.143 --> 00:30:12.644
You're not in trouble.

455
00:30:12.644 --> 00:30:14.354
You're not grounded.
Mommy and Daddy

456
00:30:14.354 --> 00:30:15.564
- aren't gonna be mad at you.
- But you have to...

457
00:30:17.399 --> 00:30:18.608
Angela.

458
00:30:18.608 --> 00:30:19.985
Okay. okay. sir...

459
00:30:22.821 --> 00:30:24.990
VICTOR
Hey.

460
00:30:28.285 --> 00:30:30.912
- Are you hurt?
- Are you mad at me?

461
00:30:30.912 --> 00:30:33.707
No. I'm not mad at you. Uh-uh.

462
00:30:33.707 --> 00:30:36.043
I'm so sorry.
I lost track of time.

463
00:30:36.043 --> 00:30:38.170
- Angela.
- Don't worry about that.

464
00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:40.672
Can you tell your dad
how long you've been gone?

465
00:30:40.672 --> 00:30:42.132
How long?

466
00:30:42.132 --> 00:30:43.717
Why do you keep asking me that?

467
00:30:43.717 --> 00:30:45.093
- It's important.
- Why do you keep asking?

468
00:30:45.093 --> 00:30:46.470
It sounds like she wants to...

469
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:48.013
Angela.

470
00:30:48.013 --> 00:30:50.390
Just tell your father
the same thing you told me.

471
00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:52.350
How long do you think
you were gone?

472
00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:54.603
I don't know. uh...

473
00:30:56.897 --> 00:30:59.191
A few hours?

474
00:31:03.779 --> 00:31:05.530
No.

475
00:31:07.115 --> 00:31:10.035
Baby. you've been gone
three days.

476
00:31:16.708 --> 00:31:18.043
I'm Dr. Lowell.

477
00:31:18.043 --> 00:31:20.045
It's very nice
to meet you today.

478
00:31:20.045 --> 00:31:22.464
Can you tell us anything
that you remember?

479
00:31:22.464 --> 00:31:23.924
We were just walking.

480
00:31:23.924 --> 00:31:25.217
And then it started raining.

481
00:31:25.217 --> 00:31:28.553
And we went into
that barn and...

482
00:31:28.553 --> 00:31:29.930
That's all I remember.

483
00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:31.223
She don't remember
too much. um...

484
00:31:31.223 --> 00:31:33.100
Okay. Okay.

485
00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:35.268
But. um. her-her feet.

486
00:31:35.268 --> 00:31:37.229
Her feet look really bad.

487
00:31:37.229 --> 00:31:39.981
Well. in order for
us to kind of get a better idea

488
00:31:39.981 --> 00:31:43.068
of what has been going on
over the past three days.

489
00:31:43.068 --> 00:31:44.569
we need to examine you.

490
00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:46.238
Sometimes when
children deal with either

491
00:31:46.238 --> 00:31:48.490
significant psychological
or traumatic injuries.

492
00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:50.408
they can maybe have some
retrograde amnesia

493
00:31:50.408 --> 00:31:52.828
where they may not remember
events that might have happened.

494
00:31:52.828 --> 00:31:54.412
How are you feeling. honey?

495
00:31:54.412 --> 00:31:55.539
Are you in pain?

496
00:31:55.539 --> 00:31:57.082
I don't know.

497
00:31:57.082 --> 00:31:58.834
Okay. Very good.

498
00:31:58.834 --> 00:32:00.752
Has she ever been
treated with hypnosis? -No.

499
00:32:00.752 --> 00:32:02.754
- Ah.
- Anybody in the family have

500
00:32:02.754 --> 00:32:04.422
any. um. psychiatric illnesses?

501
00:32:04.422 --> 00:32:06.258
No. She's healthy.
She's real strong.

502
00:32:06.258 --> 00:32:07.926
So I'm gonna
take down the buttons. okay?

503
00:32:07.926 --> 00:32:09.761
Dad. if you have any
questions at any time. just...

504
00:32:09.761 --> 00:32:11.263
Does she have
access to any medications

505
00:32:11.263 --> 00:32:12.597
- around the house?
No.

506
00:32:12.597 --> 00:32:14.432
- Okay.

507
00:32:15.851 --> 00:32:17.602
- What's going on here?
Hi. honey.

508
00:32:17.602 --> 00:32:19.271
Um. this is Dr. Lowell.

509
00:32:19.271 --> 00:32:20.939
- Hi. ma'am. I'm Dr. Lowell.
- Why didn't you wait on me?

510
00:32:20.939 --> 00:32:22.440
Feel free to stand next to her.

511
00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.192
Okay.
we'll start again from the top.

512
00:32:24.192 --> 00:32:25.819
I'm just gonna touch you
right here. okay? Gonna just...

513
00:32:25.819 --> 00:32:28.071
She's not complaining of any
pain. but she's disoriented.

514
00:32:28.071 --> 00:32:30.949
which can happen
with head trauma.

515
00:32:30.949 --> 00:32:32.409
We're just gonna
take a look over here.

516
00:32:32.409 --> 00:32:34.119
Okay. very good.
Thank you. Joe.

517
00:32:34.119 --> 00:32:36.955
Now we have to do one last
portion of the exam.

518
00:32:36.955 --> 00:32:38.373
It's a little bit uncomfortable.

519
00:32:38.373 --> 00:32:40.292
These here.
these are called stirrups.

520
00:32:40.292 --> 00:32:41.751
And. Dad. if you're okay. this
is the more sensitive part.

521
00:32:41.751 --> 00:32:43.461
Just gonna change my gloves.

522
00:32:43.461 --> 00:32:44.963
Hey. babe. I'm gonna...
I'm gonna see you

523
00:32:44.963 --> 00:32:46.256
in a few minutes. okay?

524
00:32:46.256 --> 00:32:47.757
If at any point
you feel discomfort.

525
00:32:47.757 --> 00:32:49.092
please let me know.

526
00:32:49.092 --> 00:32:50.468
You're gonna feel
a little bit of cold jelly

527
00:32:50.468 --> 00:32:53.805
and lots of pressure.
but no pain. okay?

528
00:32:53.805 --> 00:32:55.473
Just a little bit
of pressure. okay?

529
00:32:55.473 --> 00:32:58.768
I'm just gonna be
taking a few samples.

530
00:32:58.768 --> 00:32:59.978
I'm looking to see

531
00:32:59.978 --> 00:33:01.396
if your hymenal ring
is still intact.

532
00:33:01.396 --> 00:33:04.649
Sometimes when people are
touched inappropriately.

533
00:33:04.649 --> 00:33:07.235
those things can be damaged.

534
00:33:07.235 --> 00:33:09.196
We are all done.
Here you go.

535
00:33:09.196 --> 00:33:11.323
Yeah. you got it. Good girl.

536
00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:17.204
We conducted
rigorous physical exams

537
00:33:17.204 --> 00:33:18.788
and cognitive interviews.

538
00:33:18.788 --> 00:33:20.207
There's no sign of distress.

539
00:33:20.207 --> 00:33:22.417
no evidence of sexual assault.

540
00:33:22.417 --> 00:33:25.420
Toxicology is normal.
Their stories are consistent.

541
00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:27.839
They both say they just went
to hang out in the woods.

542
00:33:27.839 --> 00:33:30.175
they got lost on the way back.
and they were afraid

543
00:33:30.175 --> 00:33:32.177
of getting in trouble.
so they just kept walking.

544
00:33:32.177 --> 00:33:34.012
Three days later. they end up
30 miles down the road

545
00:33:34.012 --> 00:33:36.848
in some farmer's barn with no
concept of time having passed.

546
00:33:36.848 --> 00:33:38.308
They met someone out there.

547
00:33:38.308 --> 00:33:39.684
There has to be something
they're not telling us.

548
00:33:39.684 --> 00:33:41.311
I don't understand.
no concept of time...

549
00:33:41.311 --> 00:33:42.562
Our heads go
to complicated places

550
00:33:42.562 --> 00:33:44.189
when we're faced
with undefined anomalies.

551
00:33:44.189 --> 00:33:45.774
Mommy.

552
00:33:45.774 --> 00:33:47.359
But you guys should
consider yourselves lucky.

553
00:33:47.359 --> 00:33:49.277
Sure. girls keep secrets.

554
00:33:49.277 --> 00:33:52.530
but every test is clean.

555
00:33:53.323 --> 00:33:55.533
Everything is perfectly normal.

556
00:33:55.533 --> 00:33:57.369
Can I go home now?

557
00:33:59.246 --> 00:34:00.622
Normally. I hate it

558
00:34:00.622 --> 00:34:02.582
when someone I know
turns up here.

559
00:34:02.582 --> 00:34:06.169
but I got to tell you.
I just about died of happiness

560
00:34:06.169 --> 00:34:08.672
when I saw your name
on the intake board.

561
00:34:08.672 --> 00:34:11.132
- Now. don't you worry.

562
00:34:11.132 --> 00:34:15.595
Gonna have you out of here
in no time at all.

563
00:34:15.595 --> 00:34:18.890
I had been praying for you
night and day.

564
00:34:25.689 --> 00:34:27.565
Can I go home now?

565
00:34:30.902 --> 00:34:32.570
Okay.

566
00:34:36.908 --> 00:34:39.119
You know that I love you. right?

567
00:34:40.287 --> 00:34:42.747
You know
you can tell me anything.

568
00:34:43.748 --> 00:34:46.584
What were you and Katherine
doing out there in those woods?

569
00:34:46.584 --> 00:34:47.877
I don't know.

570
00:34:47.877 --> 00:34:50.422
I wanted to find the...

571
00:34:53.883 --> 00:34:56.553
I wanted to talk to Mama.

572
00:34:57.345 --> 00:34:59.431
Sometimes I hear her voice.

573
00:35:00.265 --> 00:35:02.434
She talks to me.

574
00:35:02.434 --> 00:35:05.687
Yeah. baby. sometimes
I hear her voice. too.

575
00:35:06.771 --> 00:35:09.357
- It doesn't mean...
- I wanted Katherine to hear.

576
00:35:09.357 --> 00:35:11.943
She reads the Bible.
She goes to church.

577
00:35:11.943 --> 00:35:13.778
I wanted to tell if I was crazy.

578
00:35:13.778 --> 00:35:16.448
- If it was really her.
- You're not crazy.

579
00:35:22.787 --> 00:35:24.205
You light a candle.

580
00:35:26.291 --> 00:35:28.084
Clear your mind.

581
00:35:28.084 --> 00:35:30.295
- Drip. drop...

582
00:35:30.295 --> 00:35:34.299
You stand in the trees holding
something that you love

583
00:35:34.299 --> 00:35:36.634
that gives you connection.

584
00:35:36.634 --> 00:35:40.096
You just start speaking
what the spirit says to you.

585
00:35:40.096 --> 00:35:42.557
What did the spirit say to you?

586
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:58.823
She wasn't there.

587
00:35:58.823 --> 00:36:00.658
No one was.

588
00:36:01.701 --> 00:36:04.454
We took the scarf.
That was my connection.

589
00:36:06.706 --> 00:36:08.375
Okay.

590
00:36:15.256 --> 00:36:17.509
Leave me alone now.

591
00:36:22.597 --> 00:36:24.307
Yeah. of course.

592
00:36:27.143 --> 00:36:28.853
Yeah.

593
00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:06.850
- Hey. baby.

594
00:37:08.059 --> 00:37:10.687
Go ahead and brush your teeth.
We got church tomorrow.

595
00:37:12.605 --> 00:37:14.232
Hey. Mama.

596
00:37:14.232 --> 00:37:16.860
do you mind if I sleep
in your bed tonight?

597
00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.653
Of course you can.

598
00:37:18.653 --> 00:37:20.905
Get brushed up
and come snuggle in.

599
00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:40.800
What you doing up. ladybug?

600
00:37:42.093 --> 00:37:43.887
Got to use the bathroom?

601
00:37:49.601 --> 00:37:51.686
Let's get you back to bed.

602
00:38:15.001 --> 00:38:16.794
Night.

603
00:38:44.614 --> 00:38:46.991
- What'd you say?

604
00:38:48.785 --> 00:38:50.078
Huh?

605
00:38:53.498 --> 00:38:55.792
I heard you say something.

606
00:38:59.295 --> 00:39:00.838
I didn't say nothing.

607
00:39:24.362 --> 00:39:26.364
Bathroom.

608
00:39:28.157 --> 00:39:29.701
Aah!

609
00:39:29.701 --> 00:39:31.828
Fucking...

610
00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:37.041
Who's ready for breakfast?

611
00:39:38.126 --> 00:39:41.546
We got Dad's famous pancakes.

612
00:39:42.297 --> 00:39:45.216
We got rocky road.

613
00:39:45.216 --> 00:39:47.468
Because why the hell not?

614
00:39:47.468 --> 00:39:49.262
If rocky road ain't
get you up...

615
00:39:49.262 --> 00:39:51.556
I don't know.

616
00:39:51.556 --> 00:39:53.099
Breakfast in bed.

617
00:39:55.935 --> 00:39:58.021
Hey.

618
00:39:58.021 --> 00:40:00.982
I never known you to sleep
through rocky road.

619
00:40:22.962 --> 00:40:25.548
Hey. Hey. hey. Ange?

620
00:40:26.466 --> 00:40:30.553
Hey. Ange. I think

Let's get you cleaned up.

00:40:50.448 --> 00:40:52.575
How are your feet?

00:40:55.244 --> 00:40:57.497
Okay. let's. uh...

628
00:40:57.497 --> 00:40:59.916

And I'm gonna...

631
00:41:07.131 --> 00:41:09.676
Now. I've moved that. Um...

632
00:41:09.676 --> 00:41:13.471
just... sit-sit-sit down.

633
00:41:28.945 --> 00:41:30.655
Huh.

634
00:41:49.507 --> 00:41:51.259
Ange?

635
00:42:26.252 --> 00:42:28.546
Ange?

636
00:42:50.151 --> 00:42:51.360
Angela?

637
00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:53.070
Where is she?

638
00:42:53.821 --> 00:42:56.073
- Angela?
- Where is she?!

639
00:42:58.075 --> 00:43:00.411
- Hey! Hey.

640
00:43:00.411 --> 00:43:02.914
- Hey. hey. Hey!

641
00:43:02.914 --> 00:43:04.957
Hey.

642
00:43:06.167 --> 00:43:07.418
Angela!

643
00:43:07.418 --> 00:43:08.836
Leave me alone!

644
00:43:08.836 --> 00:43:11.672
I want my mother.
and I want her right now!

645
00:43:11.672 --> 00:43:14.634
Stop touching me!
You're hurting me!

646
00:43:16.093 --> 00:43:19.347
Fuck you! Fuck all of you!

647
00:43:19.347 --> 00:43:20.765
Help! Help!

648
00:43:20.765 --> 00:43:22.600
No. we got you.

649
00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:24.727
She's been violently seizing.

650
00:43:24.727 --> 00:43:27.188
Let me go! Get off of me!

651
00:43:28.105 --> 00:43:30.066
I want to go home.
you son of a bitch!

652
00:43:30.066 --> 00:43:31.609
Hold her down.
Calm down. honey.

653
00:43:31.609 --> 00:43:32.944
- Honey. calm down.

654
00:43:32.944 --> 00:43:34.737
Calm down. honey.
You'd better calm down.

655
00:43:36.614 --> 00:43:38.157
Calm down.
Calm down. Calm down.

656
00:43:38.157 --> 00:43:39.951
- Daddy! Daddy!
- You're gonna feel better soon.

657
00:43:39.951 --> 00:43:41.619
Be careful there. sir.
Be careful there.

658
00:43:41.619 --> 00:43:42.954
Okay. let's get her in the bed.

659
00:43:42.954 --> 00:43:44.872
We'll just wait
until she calms down.

660
00:43:44.872 --> 00:43:47.291
Honey. you're gonna go to bed.
You're gonna go to sleep soon.

661
00:43:47.291 --> 00:43:49.377
You're gonna go to sleep soon.
Calm down.

662
00:43:49.377 --> 00:43:50.920
- Calm down. Calm down.
- Shh.

663
00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:52.922
We'll wait until
she calms down. -Shh.

664
00:43:52.922 --> 00:43:54.799
Calm down.
You're gonna go to bed soon.

665
00:43:54.799 --> 00:43:57.051

Okay. here we go.
Let's go ahead and get

Okay. checking vitals.

I need blood pressure.
heart rate. respiratory rate.

669
00:44:02.849 --> 00:44:04.433
- oxygen level.
Okay.

670
00:44:04.433 --> 00:44:05.852
Okay.

671
00:44:05.852 --> 00:44:07.520
So I think we're ready
for the medical examiner.

672
00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:08.980
- If someone can call him.
Okay.

673
00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:10.648
We need you out of the room.

674
00:44:10.648 --> 00:44:12.817
We're gonna take
good care of her. okay?

675
00:44:16.153 --> 00:44:18.656
Daddy's here. baby.

676

Daddy's here.

677
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:52.106
Have you ever seen
anything like this?

678
00:44:53.357 --> 00:44:56.944
Lord.
let your word fill our hearts.

679
00:44:56.944 --> 00:45:00.114
May all we do here today
glorify your name.

- Amen.
Amen.

681

Put your foot down.

He has seen it fit
to return to us our lost sheep.

and from there
your blood was spilled

00:47:35.019 --> 00:47:36.937
and has flowed
through the ages of time.

725
00:47:39.899 --> 00:47:42.193
For we know that...

00:47:44.195 --> 00:47:46.322
Father...

727
00:47:47.114 --> 00:47:49.158
Father. because of that blood...

The body and the blood.

729
00:47:50.701 --> 00:47:55.039
...we were saved one day
and claimed heaven as our home.

Mom. Mom. -KATHERINE: The body
and the blood.

731
00:47:59.543 --> 00:48:02.213
-  Katherine.
- The body and the blood.

732
00:48:02.213 --> 00:48:04.048
Katherine.

733
00:48:06.509 --> 00:48:09.720
So we praise you tonight
in Jesus' name. Amen.

734
00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.555

00:48:31.075 --> 00:48:32.743
Stop it!

746
00:48:32.743 --> 00:48:34.120
- The body and the blood!
- Enough!

747
00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:36.205
- The body and the blood!
- Stop it!

00:48:36.205 --> 00:48:38.207
The body and the blood!
The body and the blood!

00:48:38.207 --> 00:48:39.834

751
00:48:55.182 --> 00:48:56.767
What about the neurologist?

752
00:48:56.767 --> 00:49:01.939
Didn't he say that hormones.
stress. they can...

753
00:49:01.939 --> 00:49:04.316
they can bring on. like.
a trancelike state?

754
00:49:04.316 --> 00:49:06.110
Maybe that's why
they're not talking

755
00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:08.112
and not... they're not
making any sense. they can't...

756
00:49:08.112 --> 00:49:09.864
They take off their shoes.

757
00:49:09.864 --> 00:49:11.907
They walk 30 miles.

758
00:49:11.907 --> 00:49:14.785
You think that's hormones. puberty?

759
00:49:14.785 --> 00:49:16.453
No.

760
00:49:18.706 --> 00:49:20.040
No. I don't.

761
00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:21.500
Miranda. please. Not now.

762
00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:22.918
Katherine was supposed
to be baptized a week ago.

763
00:49:22.918 --> 00:49:24.378
He doesn't even understand.

764
00:49:24.378 --> 00:49:26.130
- In our church...
Okay? And I pushed it

765
00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:28.007
because I wanted her grandma
to be there.

766
00:49:28.007 --> 00:49:29.466
- It was selfish.
- It's not your fault.

767
00:49:29.466 --> 00:49:30.926
In our church. we don't
baptize them as infants.

768
00:49:30.926 --> 00:49:32.219
We wait until they're old enough

769
00:49:32.219 --> 00:49:33.304
to understand
Christian discipline.

770
00:49:33.304 --> 00:49:34.680
Something they did out there

771
00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:37.474
opened them up
for an unholy spirit to enter.

772
00:49:37.474 --> 00:49:40.311
That's how
demonic possession works.

773
00:49:43.147 --> 00:49:44.815
Do you know where Jesus went

774
00:49:44.815 --> 00:49:47.151
after he died on the cross.
Victor? -TONY: Miranda.

775
00:49:47.151 --> 00:49:51.822
He went to hell to declare
his authority over the devil.

776
00:49:51.822 --> 00:49:54.658
And he reappeared
three days later.

777
00:49:55.701 --> 00:49:59.246
Three days. just like our girls.

778
00:49:59.246 --> 00:50:01.999
You think they went to hell?

779
00:50:03.876 --> 00:50:06.420
Burned their feet in hell?

780
00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:09.173
Got possessed by the devil?

781
00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:14.803
Uh. pagan activity
or-or-or talking to the dead.

782
00:50:14.803 --> 00:50:16.263
Wherever those girls went.

783
00:50:16.263 --> 00:50:18.349
they brought something back
with them.

784
00:50:19.099 --> 00:50:22.061
Y'all need to get some sleep.

785
00:50:47.378 --> 00:50:49.421
Angela?

786
00:50:51.048 --> 00:50:57.096
Sister Mary Xavier.

787
00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:02.768
Scraped out she was.

788
00:51:02.768 --> 00:51:06.397
like a rotten pumpkin.

789
00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:15.572
Your baby.

790
00:51:24.123 --> 00:51:26.250
Help me! No!

791
00:51:27.126 --> 00:51:29.211
Each of the nine types

792
00:51:29.211 --> 00:51:31.672
has an associated fear.
basic desire

793
00:51:31.672 --> 00:51:33.132
and core motivation.

794
00:51:33.132 --> 00:51:35.926
In an attempt to meet
this basic desire.

795
00:51:35.926 --> 00:51:37.469
we can acquire dysfunctional

796
00:51:37.469 --> 00:51:40.222
and self-destructive
patterns of behavior.

797
00:51:40.222 --> 00:51:41.640
The Enneagram framework
can help us

798
00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:44.184
explain and understand
the stimulus

799
00:51:44.184 --> 00:51:46.437
for your daughter's
maladaptive behavior.

800
00:51:46.437 --> 00:51:48.147
It can also provide insight

801
00:51:48.147 --> 00:51:51.775
into her dissociative
identity disorder.

802
00:51:55.404 --> 00:51:56.530
I wasn't prepared
for the questions.

803
00:51:56.530 --> 00:51:58.115
We offer 24-hour monitoring...

804
00:51:58.115 --> 00:51:59.450
Did you get
to cheer at the game?

805
00:51:59.450 --> 00:52:01.243
...with trauma-informed
programming.

806
00:52:01.243 --> 00:52:02.786
a treatment team
for managing medications...

807
00:52:02.786 --> 00:52:04.830
What do you like to do
with your dogs?

808
00:52:04.830 --> 00:52:06.457
Play.

809
00:52:06.457 --> 00:52:09.168
...an hour
of regular therapy each day.

810
00:52:21.472 --> 00:52:22.639
Hey.

811
00:52:23.849 --> 00:52:27.728
You asked me if I've ever seen
anything like this before.

812
00:52:27.728 --> 00:52:29.396
No.

813
00:52:29.396 --> 00:52:33.317
But there are people out there
who have.

814
00:52:34.151 --> 00:52:36.278
I read this in college.

815
00:52:36.278 --> 00:52:38.989
I think
it might have some answers

816
00:52:38.989 --> 00:52:41.241
that Angela's doctors
don't have.

817
00:52:41.241 --> 00:52:43.660
Spiritual texts. Thanks. Got it.

818
00:52:45.537 --> 00:52:47.122
You don't believe in God?

819
00:52:47.122 --> 00:52:49.375
I don't believe in the question.

820
00:52:50.751 --> 00:52:52.669
You know. you religious types
are all alike. you know that?

821
00:52:52.669 --> 00:52:54.713
Something bad happens.
must be the devil.

822
00:52:54.713 --> 00:52:57.007
Something good happens.
must be God.

823
00:52:57.007 --> 00:53:00.511
It is a myth made up by people

824
00:53:00.511 --> 00:53:05.015
to explain things
they will never understand.

825
00:53:05.015 --> 00:53:07.267
I already did this.

826
00:53:08.268 --> 00:53:10.145
I learned the Lord's Prayer.

827
00:53:10.145 --> 00:53:11.730
I learned the Apostles' Creed.

828
00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:13.232
What'd I get?

829
00:53:13.232 --> 00:53:16.026
I got to watch my wife die.

830
00:53:16.026 --> 00:53:18.195
Watch them cut my baby girl
out of her stomach.

831
00:53:18.195 --> 00:53:20.322
And now I got to...

832
00:53:21.198 --> 00:53:24.618
Mr. Fielding. the way I see it.

833
00:53:24.618 --> 00:53:27.371
that makes your daughter
a miracle.

834
00:53:28.414 --> 00:53:30.457
Well. I got to go
check my miracle

835
00:53:30.457 --> 00:53:32.042
into the mental institution.

836
00:53:32.042 --> 00:53:33.710
Now. you'll excuse me.

837
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:36.463
- Before you slam the door.

838
00:53:36.463 --> 00:53:38.841
can you give me a minute?

839
00:53:47.766 --> 00:53:50.269
When I was younger.
I was going to become a nun.

840
00:53:50.269 --> 00:53:52.312
if you can believe it.

841
00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:56.650
I thought I was ready
to give my life to the Lord.

842
00:53:56.650 --> 00:53:58.610
but I wasn't.

843
00:53:58.610 --> 00:54:02.823
And I broke
my personal commitment.

844
00:54:03.907 --> 00:54:06.285
Right before I took my vows.

845
00:54:09.997 --> 00:54:12.958
I got pregnant...

846
00:54:12.958 --> 00:54:14.751
and I chose not to keep it.

847
00:54:16.086 --> 00:54:18.338
All novitiates choose a new name

848
00:54:18.338 --> 00:54:20.591
before they enter the convent.

849
00:54:20.591 --> 00:54:24.052
They change their name
to mark the transformation

850
00:54:24.052 --> 00:54:26.513
from their old life.

851
00:54:26.513 --> 00:54:29.516
I never got to use my name.

852
00:54:29.516 --> 00:54:31.768
but your daughter just did.

853
00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:35.647
"Sister Mary Xavier." she said.

854
00:54:35.647 --> 00:54:37.941
And she knew
what happened to my baby.

855
00:54:38.859 --> 00:54:42.571
I never told anyone
what name I had chosen.

856
00:54:43.489 --> 00:54:46.200
Or about my pregnancy.

857
00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:49.119
Not then. not since.

858
00:54:49.119 --> 00:54:52.539
Not a single living soul.

859
00:55:46.843 --> 00:55:48.845
I guess you're
somewhat of an expert

860
00:55:48.845 --> 00:55:50.847
in demonic possession.
is that correct?

861
00:55:50.847 --> 00:55:52.683
I guess you could say that.

862
00:55:52.683 --> 00:55:55.102
So did you just walk into
the Catholic church one day

863
00:55:55.102 --> 00:55:57.771
and say. "I want to sign up
for exorcist school"?

864
00:55:57.771 --> 00:56:00.899
Well. for starters.
I'm not an exorcist.

865
00:56:00.899 --> 00:56:02.693
I leave that
to the professionals.

866
00:56:02.693 --> 00:56:05.571
No. my journey began
as a mother.

867
00:56:05.571 --> 00:56:07.114
driven by
my love for my daughter.

868
00:56:07.114 --> 00:56:10.325
and I've dedicated my life
to try to understand

869
00:56:10.325 --> 00:56:12.035
the phenomenon.

870
00:56:12.035 --> 00:56:13.579
And also to help other parents

871
00:56:13.579 --> 00:56:14.997
who are going through hardships
of the unexplained.

872
00:56:14.997 --> 00:56:17.040
You've had the chance to give

873
00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.375
lectures all over the world.

874
00:56:18.375 --> 00:56:20.252
You've even had a chance
to speak at the Vatican.

875
00:56:20.252 --> 00:56:22.713
- Come. come. come. come. come.
I have. but. you know.

876
00:56:22.713 --> 00:56:25.549
possession isn't
a Catholic invention.

877
00:56:25.549 --> 00:56:27.342
Was an actress...

878
00:56:27.342 --> 00:56:29.011
turned educator.

879
00:56:29.011 --> 00:56:30.304
Kind of education.

880
00:56:30.304 --> 00:56:31.805
An expert of exorcists.

881
00:56:31.805 --> 00:56:33.390
Not an exorcist.

882
00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:34.516
Hello.
Hi. hi.

883
00:56:34.516 --> 00:56:35.976
My name is Ann Brooks.

884
00:56:35.976 --> 00:56:37.311
Oh. I was just calling about
a client of yours.

885
00:56:37.311 --> 00:56:38.562
uh. Chris MacNeil.

886
00:56:38.562 --> 00:56:40.355
The Rite of Exorcism is

887
00:56:40.355 --> 00:56:42.608
one of the oldest human rituals.

888
00:56:42.608 --> 00:56:44.109
Every culture in every country.

889
00:56:44.109 --> 00:56:46.653
for as far back as history
has been recorded.

890
00:56:46.653 --> 00:56:49.489
has a ceremony to dispel
negative energies

891
00:56:49.489 --> 00:56:52.034
and to journey toward healing.

892
00:56:52.034 --> 00:56:54.328
From the Muslim rites
to the Hebrew dybbuks.

893
00:56:54.328 --> 00:56:56.455
to the Zoroastrian texts.

894
00:56:56.455 --> 00:56:58.749
There are even some incantations
for exorcism

895
00:56:58.749 --> 00:57:00.584
in the Dead Sea Scrolls.

896
00:57:00.584 --> 00:57:03.503
So. I think
I know the answer to this.

897
00:57:03.503 --> 00:57:06.298
but is demonic possession real?

898
00:57:06.298 --> 00:57:08.425
I think the right question is:

899
00:57:08.425 --> 00:57:10.427
Are the people that I visit--

900
00:57:10.427 --> 00:57:12.596
is their suffering real?

901
00:57:12.596 --> 00:57:14.973
Absolutely.

902
00:57:24.524 --> 00:57:26.485
Father Maddox?

903
00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:32.908
Someone I know is suffering
and needs help.

904
00:57:43.335 --> 00:57:45.128
Look. look. Yeah.

905
00:57:45.128 --> 00:57:46.880
Okay. All right.

906
00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:49.007
- Good dog.

907
00:57:49.007 --> 00:57:51.718
Where's your mommy?
Your mama home?

908
00:57:51.718 --> 00:57:53.220
Huh?

909
00:57:58.266 --> 00:58:00.852
Do you believe any
of this stuff is actually real?

910
00:58:00.852 --> 00:58:03.313
Placebos are real.

911
00:58:03.313 --> 00:58:05.691
The power of suggestion is real.

912
00:58:05.691 --> 00:58:07.317
Belief is real.

913
00:58:07.317 --> 00:58:10.487
I think what you're asking me is...

914
00:58:10.487 --> 00:58:15.075
if I believe any of this stuff
will really help your daughter.

915
00:58:15.075 --> 00:58:20.372
But what you should be asking
is if you believe it.

916
00:58:20.372 --> 00:58:22.290
Hmm. Skeptic.

917
00:58:22.290 --> 00:58:24.167
That's good.

918
00:58:24.167 --> 00:58:26.920
But that'll only get you so far.

919
00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:30.173
After that. you got to come up
with some real answers.

920
00:58:30.173 --> 00:58:32.676
I know some spiritual
counselors that...

921
00:58:32.676 --> 00:58:35.595
No. no.
No. that's not what we need.

922
00:58:35.595 --> 00:58:38.014
I want to talk about Regan.

923
00:58:38.014 --> 00:58:39.975
About her exorcism.

924
00:58:44.354 --> 00:58:48.692
I didn't actually witness it.
you know. the exorcism.

925
00:58:48.692 --> 00:58:51.069
- They wouldn't let me.
- Why not?

926
00:58:52.028 --> 00:58:53.447
My opinion.

927
00:58:53.447 --> 00:58:55.866
it's 'cause I'm not a member
of their damn patriarchy.

928
00:58:57.534 --> 00:58:59.619
I may not have
witnessed the exorcism.

929
00:58:59.619 --> 00:59:03.039
but I sure as all hell
witnessed the possession.

930
00:59:04.082 --> 00:59:07.210
I spent the next ten years
trying to understand

931
00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:09.045
what I saw with my own eyes.

932
00:59:09.045 --> 00:59:12.132
I studied every culture.
every religion.

933
00:59:12.132 --> 00:59:14.176
every ritual for it
I could find.

934
00:59:14.176 --> 00:59:18.138
I just learned so much
about all this stuff.

935
00:59:18.138 --> 00:59:22.517
I wanted people to understand
that it's possible to survive

936
00:59:22.517 --> 00:59:24.644
the most traumatic experiences

937
00:59:24.644 --> 00:59:27.898
and not only survive but thrive.

938
00:59:30.066 --> 00:59:31.610
Is this her? Is this Regan?

939
00:59:31.610 --> 00:59:32.986
Yeah.

940
00:59:32.986 --> 00:59:34.613
That's her.

941
00:59:36.907 --> 00:59:38.617
But then the book came out.

942
00:59:38.617 --> 00:59:41.745
It was such a huge success.

943
00:59:41.745 --> 00:59:42.996
She hated it.

944
00:59:42.996 --> 00:59:45.832
She never forgave me
for writing it.

945
00:59:45.832 --> 00:59:47.542
I never forgave myself.

946
00:59:47.542 --> 00:59:49.586
She went into hiding.

947
00:59:49.586 --> 00:59:51.004
She moved away.

948
00:59:51.004 --> 00:59:53.590
Even now. I don't know
where she is.

949
00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:55.675
She won't tell me.

950
00:59:57.260 --> 01:00:01.932
There are many dark forces
in this world. Mr. Fielding.

951
01:00:01.932 --> 01:00:04.309
Not all of them
are supernatural.

952
01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:07.604
I wake up every morning

953
01:00:07.604 --> 01:00:10.148
wondering where my daughter is.

954
01:00:10.148 --> 01:00:12.776
Praying that
I'll see her sweet face again

955
01:00:12.776 --> 01:00:14.277
one of these days.

956
01:00:15.904 --> 01:00:17.614
There's something
I saw in your book

957
01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:19.616
that made me come here today.

958
01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:21.785
They took some photos
in the hospital.

959
01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:28.959
I want to help my daughter
like you helped yours.

960
01:00:28.959 --> 01:00:31.127
Like you helped Regan.

961
01:00:43.056 --> 01:00:44.808
Oh. thank God.

962
01:00:46.476 --> 01:00:49.813
Father Maddox.
Victor. Angela's father.

963
01:00:49.813 --> 01:00:51.189
And Chris MacNeil.

964
01:00:51.189 --> 01:00:52.858
- the woman I told you about.
- Of course.

965
01:00:52.858 --> 01:00:55.277
Thank you so much
for joining us.

966
01:00:55.277 --> 01:00:57.988
I assume you're familiar with
our sanctioned procedures. yes?

967
01:00:57.988 --> 01:00:59.197
I am.

968
01:00:59.197 --> 01:01:00.699
Where is she?

969
01:01:17.382 --> 01:01:19.885
She knows who I am.

970
01:01:21.011 --> 01:01:23.680
Where's the other girl?

971
01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.807
Taking care of her at home.

972
01:01:25.807 --> 01:01:28.018
That's not a good idea.

973
01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:35.984
She's waiting for you.

974
01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:49.497
There's no one home.

975
01:01:51.499 --> 01:01:53.126
Yes. there is.

976
01:01:53.126 --> 01:01:54.878
Your call has been forwarded

977
01:01:54.878 --> 01:01:56.796
to an automated...

978
01:02:02.218 --> 01:02:03.678
Tony?

979
01:02:03.678 --> 01:02:05.805
Miranda.

980
01:02:05.805 --> 01:02:07.182
Hey. Tony.

981
01:02:10.143 --> 01:02:11.895
Miranda?

982
01:02:19.694 --> 01:02:22.072
Oh. my gosh.

983
01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:27.577
Where did she go?

984
01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:28.870
They were looking for spirits.

985
01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:30.121
I'm Chris MacNeil.

986
01:02:30.121 --> 01:02:32.374
- She came home.
- I'm here to help.

987
01:02:32.374 --> 01:02:34.292
Tony? Hey.

988
01:02:35.335 --> 01:02:36.586
This is my friend Chris.

989
01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:37.545
She's gonna do
everything she can

990
01:02:37.545 --> 01:02:38.463
to help our daughters.

991
01:02:38.463 --> 01:02:39.756
We've all sinned.

992
01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:41.549
We've all fallen short.

993
01:02:41.549 --> 01:02:44.010
But my sin has weakened me.

994
01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:46.054
God is punishing us.

995
01:02:46.054 --> 01:02:47.472
- Come on.

996
01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:01.486
Katherine?

997
01:03:15.834 --> 01:03:17.794
Protect our
little girl from this evil.

998
01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:20.463
Comfort her with your spirit.

999
01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:24.592
Hide her from this evil realm
with your power. Lord.

1000
01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:28.138
Lord. you are the light
in the darkness.

1001
01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:30.473
- Surround her...
Where's Katherine?

1002
01:03:31.391 --> 01:03:34.310
Let's get you out of here.
all right?

1003
01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:46.823
I know who you are.

1004
01:03:48.366 --> 01:03:50.785
And you know who I am.

1005
01:03:50.785 --> 01:03:52.495
We've met before.

1006
01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:55.290
But I'm not talking to you now.

1007
01:03:55.290 --> 01:03:58.460
Are you looking for Regan?

1008
01:03:59.461 --> 01:04:01.671
Are you looking for Regan?

1009
01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:03.923
Are you looking
for Regan?!

1010
01:04:03.923 --> 01:04:06.843
Don't be scared.

1011
01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:09.054
We're here to help you.

1012
01:04:09.054 --> 01:04:11.473
We can tell you where she is.

1013
01:04:11.473 --> 01:04:13.933
All you have to do is ask.

1014
01:04:13.933 --> 01:04:16.352
I ask nothing of you.

1015
01:04:16.352 --> 01:04:18.772
I renounce you.

1016
01:04:18.772 --> 01:04:21.691
I come here to return life
to this child

1017
01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:24.861
from whom it is
unwillingly taken.

1018
01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:27.280
You don't know
what happened to her.

1019
01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.990
but we do.

1020
01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:31.618
She burns in hell!

1021
01:04:36.873 --> 01:04:39.918
Mom! Help! Mother. please!

1022
01:04:39.918 --> 01:04:42.003
Mother. please make it stop!
It's hurting!

1023
01:04:42.003 --> 01:04:45.006
In the name of all holy beings.

1024
01:04:45.006 --> 01:04:49.761
in the name of
my beloved daughter Regan.

1025
01:04:49.761 --> 01:04:51.096
- release this child.

1026
01:04:51.096 --> 01:04:53.139
Release this child.

1027
01:04:53.139 --> 01:04:55.934
- Release this child!

1028
01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:20.917
Katherine.

1029
01:05:31.094 --> 01:05:33.096
I am no devil.

1030
01:05:34.806 --> 01:05:36.724
There is none.

1031
01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:46.025
You want to see your beloved.

1032
01:05:46.025 --> 01:05:47.652
cunting daughter?

1033
01:05:47.652 --> 01:05:49.904
Help. I...

1034
01:05:49.904 --> 01:05:51.656
Open your eyes.

1035
01:05:51.656 --> 01:05:53.158
Chris.

1036
01:05:56.452 --> 01:05:57.787
Sorenne!

1037
01:05:57.787 --> 01:06:01.291
Protect her.

1038
01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:02.750
Sorenne!

1039
01:06:10.842 --> 01:06:12.635
- What did you do?
- Victor. no.

1040
01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:14.387
What did you do?!

1041
01:06:28.610 --> 01:06:31.696
Tony? Tony.

1042
01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:42.665
I feel them. I feel those girls.

1043
01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:44.125
I feel them.

1044
01:06:44.125 --> 01:06:49.130
Mommy. why can't you make it
stop hurting?

1045
01:07:10.443 --> 01:07:12.362
Most Reverend Fathers.

1046
01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:14.364
after consideration
of all of the evidence

1047
01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:16.282
and possible outcomes

1048
01:07:16.282 --> 01:07:18.743
and what I have seen
with mine own eyes.

1049
01:07:18.743 --> 01:07:21.162
we ask your support
in approaching the bishop

1050
01:07:21.162 --> 01:07:22.538
to sanction the exorcism.

1051
01:07:22.538 --> 01:07:24.582
Well. Father.
we are here to support you.

1052
01:07:24.582 --> 01:07:27.502
We want to be here for you
in-in any circumstances.

1053
01:07:27.502 --> 01:07:28.878
This is
a very dangerous situation.

1054
01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:30.129
Dangerous for you. Father.

1055
01:07:30.129 --> 01:07:31.506
Dangerous for
the Catholic church.

1056
01:07:31.506 --> 01:07:34.968
Please understand.
I have prayed with her

1057
01:07:34.968 --> 01:07:36.594
and observed her actions.

1058
01:07:36.594 --> 01:07:39.430
When I... when I rest...
when I rested my hand

1059
01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:42.225
upon her head.
I felt nothing but pain.

1060
01:07:42.225 --> 01:07:46.187
There is a-a spirit that
is present alongside of them.

1061
01:07:46.187 --> 01:07:48.815
We must move forward
as soon as possible

1062
01:07:48.815 --> 01:07:50.233
with this ritual.

1063
01:07:50.233 --> 01:07:52.652
with the help of all of you.

1064
01:07:52.652 --> 01:07:57.532
lest the lives of two of our
Lord's young children be lost.

1065
01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:06.124
Who's that?

1066
01:08:06.124 --> 01:08:07.417
It's Victor.

1067
01:08:07.417 --> 01:08:10.586
I'm so sorry
I brought you back into this.

1068
01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:12.422
This is my fault.

1069
01:08:12.422 --> 01:08:15.300
Do you know what that thing
said to me when I...

1070
01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:17.302
I was in the room with it?

1071
01:08:17.302 --> 01:08:21.848
It tried to convince me
that Regan is dead.

1072
01:08:23.182 --> 01:08:24.600
What do you believe?

1073
01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:27.770
Oh. well. I don't think that.
I'll tell you.

1074
01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:30.440
Hope is what keeps me alive.

1075
01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:33.234
And that's what you're gonna
have to find to do this.

1076
01:08:33.234 --> 01:08:37.113
What happened in there
wasn't your fault.

1077
01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:40.950
Something inside our girls
called out for help.

1078
01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:42.952
It brought you to me.

1079
01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:44.495
It put me in that room.

1080
01:08:44.495 --> 01:08:47.457
Those girls are connected now.

1081
01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:49.375
Their families are connected.

1082
01:08:49.375 --> 01:08:52.128
I have studied
the Rite of Exorcism

1083
01:08:52.128 --> 01:08:54.505
in every culture
that I could find.

1084
01:08:55.381 --> 01:08:57.800
They all have
different ceremonies.

1085
01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:00.845
but the one thing
they all have in common.

1086
01:09:00.845 --> 01:09:06.184
the most important thing
of all. is people.

1087
01:09:06.184 --> 01:09:08.519
We go to church
in times of trouble

1088
01:09:08.519 --> 01:09:11.439
because we believe
it's the house of God.

1089
01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:15.860
But also. there are people
there. other people--

1090
01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:19.489
whether it's family
or neighbors or strangers.

1091
01:09:19.489 --> 01:09:23.159
Yes. they're all there
to affirm their faith in God.

1092
01:09:23.159 --> 01:09:24.744
but they're also there

1093
01:09:24.744 --> 01:09:27.830
to affirm their faith
in each other.

1094
01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:29.624
It's not over.

1095
01:09:29.624 --> 01:09:34.337
Maybe Regan is gone. but you
can bring your daughter back.

1096
01:09:34.337 --> 01:09:38.299
You've got to bring everyone together.

1097
01:09:38.299 --> 01:09:41.386
That's what will make this work.

1098
01:09:58.694 --> 01:10:00.363
Hey. pal. Listen.

1099
01:10:00.363 --> 01:10:02.281
I need to get in touch
with the woman

1100
01:10:02.281 --> 01:10:06.202
you had come over the house
and do the blessing.

1101
01:10:06.994 --> 01:10:08.538
What was her name again?

1102
01:10:19.132 --> 01:10:21.134
This your family?

1103
01:10:21.134 --> 01:10:22.718
No.

1104
01:10:22.718 --> 01:10:26.222
Just asking
to borrow some earth.

1105
01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:28.391
Now. when you take something.

1106
01:10:28.391 --> 01:10:31.060
you have to give something
in return.

1107
01:10:32.019 --> 01:10:34.147
How much do you know
about what I do. Mr. Fielding?

1108
01:10:34.147 --> 01:10:36.149
About root work?

1109
01:10:36.149 --> 01:10:37.483
Not enough.

1110
01:10:37.483 --> 01:10:40.403
Enslaved people
that were brought here.

1111
01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:42.738
they relied on
traditional beliefs

1112
01:10:42.738 --> 01:10:44.699
about spirit
brought from Africa.

1113
01:10:44.699 --> 01:10:48.369
They combined that with native
tools to protect themselves.

1114
01:10:48.369 --> 01:10:50.830
and they balanced it
with the herbs and roots

1115
01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:54.917
that are growing in the earth
that they're forced to till

1116
01:10:54.917 --> 01:10:57.462
or the shells of the ocean

1117
01:10:57.462 --> 01:10:59.630
that carried them
from their homes.

1118
01:10:59.630 --> 01:11:01.507
When I had my oncology practice.

1119
01:11:01.507 --> 01:11:05.094
I didn't put much credence
in traditional healing rituals.

1120
01:11:05.094 --> 01:11:09.390
but I learned that sometimes.

1121
01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:12.560
to go forward.
you have to go back.

1122
01:11:14.312 --> 01:11:16.564
Which way are you headed?

1123
01:11:30.453 --> 01:11:32.622
The beginning and the end.

1124
01:11:32.622 --> 01:11:34.415
This is the eternal space.

1125
01:11:34.415 --> 01:11:38.294
This is the ancestral space.
the realm of mysteries.

1126
01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:41.130
And what we want to do
is open up a channel

1127
01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:42.673
to this realm

1128
01:11:42.673 --> 01:11:45.968
to give us what we need
here on earth.

1129
01:11:45.968 --> 01:11:48.888
And that's what
we're going to do tonight.

1130
01:11:48.888 --> 01:11:51.432
You need to break through
this watery realm

1131
01:11:51.432 --> 01:11:54.310
that is separating
these two dimensions.

1132
01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:58.981
We want them to come through.
We want them to come through.

1133
01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:02.610
Ready?

1134
01:12:11.827 --> 01:12:13.913
Daddy's got you. Come on.

1135
01:12:15.331 --> 01:12:16.999
Miranda. I'm going in.

1136
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.961
Get the door.

1137
01:12:19.961 --> 01:12:21.629
It's okay. baby.

1138
01:12:45.319 --> 01:12:47.530
Down. All right.

1139
01:12:48.322 --> 01:12:50.449
- Okay.
- All right.

1140
01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:54.829
If this doesn't work

1141
01:12:54.829 --> 01:12:57.415
and something else goes wrong
and they take her from us.

1142
01:12:57.415 --> 01:12:59.292
- I don't know what I'm...
- Miranda. Shh. shh.

1143
01:12:59.292 --> 01:13:00.876
Hey.

1144
01:13:00.876 --> 01:13:02.378
It's going to work.

1145
01:13:02.378 --> 01:13:05.256
The priest is on his way. Shh.

1146
01:13:05.256 --> 01:13:07.049
It has to work.

1147
01:13:10.553 --> 01:13:12.847
- Here you go. man.
- Thanks.

1148
01:13:13.931 --> 01:13:15.725
Check if they're even.

1149
01:13:22.481 --> 01:13:25.067
All right. we got it.

1150
01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:26.902
It's good. Stu.

1151
01:13:26.902 --> 01:13:28.487
Thanks.

1152
01:13:38.956 --> 01:13:40.499
Hello. Father.

1153
01:13:40.499 --> 01:13:43.169
We're almost ready.
Everyone is gathering inside.

1154
01:13:43.169 --> 01:13:45.421
Ann. I. um...

1155
01:13:46.547 --> 01:13:48.799
I spoke to the diocese.

1156
01:13:48.799 --> 01:13:51.719
and they have determined that...

1157
01:13:51.719 --> 01:13:54.722
given the circumstances.
the well-being of these girls

1158
01:13:54.722 --> 01:13:58.434
would best be helped through
psychiatric intervention.

1159
01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:01.604
But you...

1160
01:14:01.604 --> 01:14:03.606
- you know it's more than that.
- I...

1161
01:14:03.606 --> 01:14:05.274
- I-I am sorry.

1162
01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:07.652
Okay. but it doesn't matter.

1163
01:14:07.652 --> 01:14:09.779
I cannot be a part of this.

1164
01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:12.239
Please understand.
people have died

1165
01:14:12.239 --> 01:14:13.783
on both sides of possession.

1166
01:14:13.783 --> 01:14:16.535
What you're doing here
is dangerous.

1167
01:14:16.535 --> 01:14:18.120
and it is religious interference.

1168
01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:19.330
No.

1169
01:14:19.330 --> 01:14:21.123
We're doing it.

1170
01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.710
- With or without you. Father.

1171
01:14:25.836 --> 01:14:27.713
- I-I...
- With or without you.

1172
01:14:27.713 --> 01:14:29.298
I'm sorry. Ann.

1173
01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:32.635
- I just... I cannot.
- With all due respect. Father.

1174
01:14:32.635 --> 01:14:35.054
what do you expect us to do?

1175
01:14:35.054 --> 01:14:38.474
Sit there and watch
those children suffer?

1176
01:14:49.193 --> 01:14:50.736
Here.

1177
01:14:52.029 --> 01:14:53.572
Hold on tight.

1178
01:14:53.572 --> 01:14:56.659
You keep your distance
from them.

1179
01:14:56.659 --> 01:14:59.370
you follow
the Rule of Saint Benedict.

1180
01:14:59.370 --> 01:15:00.871
and you stand up
to this creature

1181
01:15:00.871 --> 01:15:02.832
with deprecatory prayer.
do you understand?

1182
01:15:02.832 --> 01:15:04.834
When Jesus called
his 12 together...

1183
01:15:06.043 --> 01:15:08.838
...he granted them the power
and authority

1184
01:15:08.838 --> 01:15:11.465
to cast out all demons.

1185
01:15:11.465 --> 01:15:13.676
- to cure all diseases.
- Yes.

1186
01:15:13.676 --> 01:15:15.594
And then he sent them
out into the world

1187
01:15:15.594 --> 01:15:18.681
to proclaim the kingdom of God
and to heal. Ann.

1188
01:15:18.681 --> 01:15:20.516
- Yes.
- To heal the sick.

1189
01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:22.518
Yes.

1190
01:15:26.814 --> 01:15:31.193
The power of Christ works
through all of us.

1191
01:15:34.697 --> 01:15:36.866
"In my name
they shall cast out devils.

1192
01:15:36.866 --> 01:15:38.701
"they shall speak
with new tongues.

1193
01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:40.202
"they shall take up serpents.
they shall

1194
01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:43.456
lay hands on the sick.
and they shall recover."

1195
01:15:43.456 --> 01:15:45.082
The girls are sleeping.

1196
01:15:45.082 --> 01:15:46.542
They're ready.

1197
01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:48.586
Has Father Maddox arrived?

1198
01:15:48.586 --> 01:15:50.171
He's not gonna be joining us.

1199
01:15:50.171 --> 01:15:51.797
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

1200
01:15:51.797 --> 01:15:53.799
He's not coming?
This was the entire point.

1201
01:15:53.799 --> 01:15:55.551
Something about the church
wouldn't let him.

1202
01:15:55.551 --> 01:15:57.386
Miranda. this isn't
what we talked about.

1203
01:15:59.555 --> 01:16:02.224
I live...

1204
01:16:02.224 --> 01:16:03.934
in the name of Jesus.

1205
01:16:07.813 --> 01:16:10.941
Here. we are asking God

1206
01:16:10.941 --> 01:16:14.653
to free these children
from infestation.

1207
01:16:14.653 --> 01:16:18.073
We are asking God to intervene.

1208
01:16:18.073 --> 01:16:20.993
I'm not denying the grace
of a holy priest.

1209
01:16:20.993 --> 01:16:24.622
but I can give it
everything I've got.

1210
01:16:25.664 --> 01:16:28.626
I am meant to do it.

1211
01:16:28.626 --> 01:16:30.294
I can do it.

1212
01:16:31.462 --> 01:16:35.132
I can perform the Roman Rite.

1213
01:16:35.132 --> 01:16:37.510
I see now

1214
01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:40.095
why the Lord took me out
of the convent.

1215
01:16:41.889 --> 01:16:45.768
I see now why he put me
in the house next door.

1216
01:16:46.644 --> 01:16:49.897
To be here with you tonight.

1217
01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:53.150
It's going to take all of us.

1218
01:16:57.488 --> 01:16:58.823
I like it.

1219
01:16:59.657 --> 01:17:01.283
It takes all kinds.

1220
01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:02.618
We're here.

1221
01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:04.787
We're together.

1222
01:17:04.787 --> 01:17:06.288
This can work. It'll work.

1223
01:17:06.288 --> 01:17:07.957
- I hope you're sure.
Yeah. I'm sure.

1224
01:17:07.957 --> 01:17:10.543
You better be. too.
before you step in that room.

1225
01:17:10.543 --> 01:17:13.838
We all better be. Anybody else
want to leave. leave now.

1226
01:17:14.672 --> 01:17:16.966
Once we start.
we're not stopping.

1227
01:17:19.385 --> 01:17:20.928
That's it.

1228
01:17:22.054 --> 01:17:23.681
After you.

1229
01:17:59.717 --> 01:18:01.677
Smell got worse.

1230
01:18:15.691 --> 01:18:17.026
Is that Katherine's heartbeat?

1231
01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:19.236
They're beating in sync.

1232
01:18:29.872 --> 01:18:31.790
Shall we begin?

1233
01:18:36.837 --> 01:18:39.256
Their vibrations are strong.

1234
01:18:42.009 --> 01:18:44.428
I call on you
to put your hands on us

1235
01:18:44.428 --> 01:18:48.390
that we might keep safe the
heart of these dear children.

1236
01:18:49.308 --> 01:18:52.269
It's gris-gris. for protection.

1237
01:18:52.269 --> 01:18:54.688
Once we get started.

1238
01:18:54.688 --> 01:18:57.066
try not to touch the children.

1239
01:19:02.446 --> 01:19:04.406
Okay.

1240
01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:16.418

Demon. your voice

See you in hell.

- You are the whore of God.
- No.

1286
01:21:21.043 --> 01:21:25.255
You were to honor your mother
with a child in her name.

1287
01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:32.012
Did the power of Christ
compel you?

1288
01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:35.140
We need to try something else.

1289
01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:36.558
Something different.
Something new.

1301
01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:34.867
I share my tortures
with none but God.

01:22:46.461 --> 01:22:48.714
REVANS and MIRANDA:
Glory. forever and ever.

1303
01:23:05.939 --> 01:23:08.025
What's happening to us?

1304
01:23:12.279 --> 01:23:15.824
Drip. drop. Drip. drop.

1305
01:23:15.824 --> 01:23:17.659
Drip. drop.

1306
01:23:42.267 --> 01:23:44.144
Let's see what root work can do.

1307
01:23:44.144 --> 01:23:46.104
Put the bowls at their side.

1308
01:23:46.104 --> 01:23:48.440
This is our end
and our beginning.

1309
01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:52.152
"It is you who will trample
our affliction.

1310
01:23:52.152 --> 01:23:54.363
healing in atonement
for our sisters."

1311
01:23:54.363 --> 01:23:56.281
It was the hyssop branch

1312
01:23:56.281 --> 01:23:58.367
that was raised
to quench the lips

1313
01:23:58.367 --> 01:24:00.035
of the lamb on the cross.

1314
01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:01.328
What are you doing?

1315
01:24:01.328 --> 01:24:02.871
Vinegar offered in jest

1316
01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:04.665
- that became our salvation.

1317
01:24:04.665 --> 01:24:06.041
- She knows what she's doing.
What is she doing?

1318
01:24:06.041 --> 01:24:07.542
I mean. what-what is that?

1319
01:24:07.542 --> 01:24:09.002
"I will sprinkle clean water
on you.

1320
01:24:09.002 --> 01:24:10.379
and you will be clean.
I will..."

1321
01:24:10.379 --> 01:24:12.381
"And I will cleanse you
from all impurities

1322
01:24:12.381 --> 01:24:14.967
and from all idols." Ezekiel.

1323
01:24:14.967 --> 01:24:16.885
Ezekiel.

1324
01:24:16.885 --> 01:24:19.221
And when they cut
the flesh of the lamb.

1325
01:24:19.221 --> 01:24:23.100
it was water and blood
that poured to the earth.

1326
01:24:28.814 --> 01:24:30.357
Baby.

1327
01:24:32.401 --> 01:24:34.361
KATHERINE
Mama.

1328
01:24:38.282 --> 01:24:39.616
Oh. baby. I'm right here.

1329
01:24:39.616 --> 01:24:41.410
- Mommy. I-I can't see you.
- No. don't...

1330
01:24:41.410 --> 01:24:43.078
- Where are you?
- Don't-don't touch her.

1331
01:24:49.751 --> 01:24:52.462
Dad!

1332
01:24:52.462 --> 01:24:54.298
- It hurts!
- Angela. Angela.

1333
01:24:54.298 --> 01:24:56.091
Don't touch her.
Don't touch her.

1334
01:24:56.091 --> 01:24:57.968
- Daddy. it hurts.
- Angela. Angela. I'm here.

1335
01:25:00.304 --> 01:25:01.680
They're trying to release.

1336
01:25:03.056 --> 01:25:04.891
Release it. Angela.

1337
01:25:04.891 --> 01:25:07.269
Release. Believe.

1338
01:25:07.269 --> 01:25:09.354
Release it. baby.

1339
01:25:09.354 --> 01:25:10.647
Dad. it's coming.

1340
01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:13.233
Dad!

1341
01:25:23.118 --> 01:25:24.161
What is that?

1342
01:25:24.161 --> 01:25:25.454
It's vapor from inside.

1343
01:25:25.454 --> 01:25:26.955
They're at a critical temperature.

1344
01:25:26.955 --> 01:25:28.457
The start of an eruption.

1345
01:25:28.457 --> 01:25:30.459
This is putrid.

1346
01:25:56.985 --> 01:25:58.820
Oh. my God.

1347
01:26:14.336 --> 01:26:16.797
- Is it over? Is that it?
No.

1348
01:26:16.797 --> 01:26:19.007
- It's a start.
In the name of Jesus.

1349
01:26:19.007 --> 01:26:21.593
- In the name of Jesus...
In the name of Jesus.

1350
01:26:21.593 --> 01:26:24.471
Lord. help us keep these
connections to each other.

1351
01:26:24.471 --> 01:26:25.722
In the name of Jesus...
To you.

1352
01:26:25.722 --> 01:26:27.682
- To these children.
- Take this bowl.

1353
01:26:27.682 --> 01:26:30.477
Dump it to the east.
away from the house.

1354
01:26:30.477 --> 01:26:31.686
In the name of Jesus...

1355
01:26:31.686 --> 01:26:33.313
In the name of Jesus...

1356
01:26:33.313 --> 01:26:34.856
- In the name of Jesus...
- In the name of Jesus...

1357
01:26:34.856 --> 01:26:37.109
In the name of Jesus...

1358
01:26:37.109 --> 01:26:39.653
In the name of Jesus.

1359
01:27:01.383 --> 01:27:04.094
...for your blessing. dear Lord.
for I know not what I do.

1360
01:27:04.094 --> 01:27:06.221
- And know that I am...

1361
01:27:07.556 --> 01:27:09.558
The fight's in there.

1362
01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:16.898
"...who was led into the desert

1363
01:27:16.898 --> 01:27:20.777
"after his baptism by John
to vanquish you.

1364
01:27:20.777 --> 01:27:23.405
Yield. then. to God."

1365
01:27:26.032 --> 01:27:28.243
"Yield. then. to God."

1366
01:27:28.243 --> 01:27:30.078
- Yield to God.
"In the person of Pharaoh

Thy kingdom come.
thy will be done...

1371
01:27:56.771 --> 01:28:01.026
You never wanted me.

1372
01:28:07.407 --> 01:28:09.951
You made your choice

1373
01:28:09.951 --> 01:28:12.787
when my mother was dying!

1374
01:28:12.787 --> 01:28:15.248
Your wife has serious injuries.

1375
01:28:15.248 --> 01:28:16.625
Anything we do to keep her alive

1376
01:28:16.625 --> 01:28:18.251
will endanger your child.

1377
01:28:18.251 --> 01:28:20.712
and we cannot save them both.

1378
01:28:24.257 --> 01:28:25.675
Save my wife.

1379
01:28:25.675 --> 01:28:27.969
Then save my wife.

1380
01:28:29.304 --> 01:28:31.389
Don't listen to it. Victor.

1381
01:28:31.389 --> 01:28:32.724
Don't. Victor.

1382
01:28:32.724 --> 01:28:35.143
Let them kill the child.

1383
01:28:35.143 --> 01:28:36.978
You wanted Mother.

1384
01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:40.357
Victor.

1385
01:28:40.357 --> 01:28:45.654
God played a trick on you.

1386
01:28:46.655 --> 01:28:48.907
The baby lived instead.

1387
01:28:48.907 --> 01:28:50.450
What?

1388
01:28:50.450 --> 01:28:51.993
The one you never wanted.

1389
01:28:51.993 --> 01:28:55.664
So we ripped her from the belly
of your dying bride!

1390
01:28:57.499 --> 01:29:00.126
Now you
have to make another choice.

1391
01:29:00.126 --> 01:29:02.170
One girl lives.

1392
01:29:02.170 --> 01:29:04.130
One girl dies.

1393
01:29:04.130 --> 01:29:05.799
Deceiver!

1394
01:29:05.799 --> 01:29:09.427
Do not offer that which is
already belongs to God.

1395
01:29:14.641 --> 01:29:16.518
Do it. Father.

1396
01:29:16.518 --> 01:29:18.687
Make the choice
you should have made then.

1397
01:29:18.687 --> 01:29:19.938
Choose me!

1398
01:29:19.938 --> 01:29:22.023
No. Mother. choose me.

1399
01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:28.488
Protect her.

1400
01:29:30.699 --> 01:29:32.742
Choose me.

1401
01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:35.287
Choose me.

1402
01:29:35.287 --> 01:29:37.497
- Choose me.
- Choose me.

1403
01:29:37.497 --> 01:29:40.041
They can't be asking us
to do this.

1404
01:29:40.041 --> 01:29:43.461
Lead us not astray with
your forked tongue of lies.

1405
01:29:43.461 --> 01:29:45.964
Please. choose me.

1406
01:29:45.964 --> 01:29:49.301
Please. Daddy. choose me.

1407
01:29:49.301 --> 01:29:52.470
- Choose me.
- Choose me.

1408
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:54.723
Please. Daddy.

1409
01:29:57.434 --> 01:30:00.395
KATHERINE
Who's got to go?

1410
01:30:00.395 --> 01:30:02.731
Eeny. meeny.

1411
01:30:02.731 --> 01:30:06.443
miny. mo.

1412
01:30:07.402 --> 01:30:11.406
KATHERINE and ANGELA:
You must choose.

1413
01:30:11.406 --> 01:30:13.825
or both girls die.

1414
01:30:19.414 --> 01:30:21.082
I won't choose.

1415
01:30:22.083 --> 01:30:23.918
We can't choose.

1416
01:30:26.254 --> 01:30:27.922
ANGELA
Choose me.

1417
01:30:27.922 --> 01:30:31.593
Who's gonna make it?

1418
01:30:34.304 --> 01:30:36.014
In the name of

1419
01:30:36.014 --> 01:30:38.558
the Father and of the Son

1420
01:30:38.558 --> 01:30:40.268
and of the Holy Ghost.

1421
01:30:40.268 --> 01:30:41.770
Amen.

1422
01:30:41.770 --> 01:30:44.272
Most glorious prince of
the heavenly armies... -Oh.

1423
01:30:44.272 --> 01:30:46.149
...Saint Michael the Archangel.

1424
01:30:46.149 --> 01:30:48.777
defend us in our battle against
principalities and powers.

1425
01:30:48.777 --> 01:30:50.403
- against the rulers...
Thank you. Father.

1426
01:30:50.403 --> 01:30:51.946
...of this world of darkness.

1427
01:30:51.946 --> 01:30:54.991
against the spirits of
wickedness in the high places.

1428
01:30:54.991 --> 01:30:56.826
- Come to the assistance of men

1429
01:30:56.826 --> 01:30:59.329
whom God has created
in his likeness

1430
01:30:59.329 --> 01:31:01.581
and whom he has redeemed
at a great price

1431
01:31:01.581 --> 01:31:03.375
from the tyranny of the devil.

1432
01:31:04.959 --> 01:31:06.711
I charge you. Satan.

1433
01:31:06.711 --> 01:31:10.256
I charge you. Satan.
enemy of human salvation.

1434
01:31:10.256 --> 01:31:13.843
acknowledge the justice
and goodness of God the Father.

1435
01:31:13.843 --> 01:31:15.929
who. by his righteous judgment.

1436
01:31:15.929 --> 01:31:19.391
has damned your pride
and your envy.

1437
01:31:19.391 --> 01:31:22.018
Depart from
these servants of God

1438
01:31:22.018 --> 01:31:24.771
whom the Lord has made
in his own image.

1439
01:31:24.771 --> 01:31:26.856
who are adorned with his gifts

1440
01:31:26.856 --> 01:31:29.609
and adopted as daughters
of his mercy.

1441
01:31:29.609 --> 01:31:32.821
I charge you. Satan.
prince of this world.

1442
01:31:32.821 --> 01:31:37.325
acknowledge the power and
the strength of Jesus Christ.

1443
01:31:37.325 --> 01:31:39.536
who defeated you in the desert.

1444
01:31:39.536 --> 01:31:41.579
overcame you in the garden.

1445
01:31:41.579 --> 01:31:44.708
despoiled you on the cross.

1446
01:31:44.708 --> 01:31:46.793
- and in rising from the tomb...

1447
01:31:46.793 --> 01:31:49.671
...transferred your spoils
into the kingdom of light.

1448
01:31:49.671 --> 01:31:52.507
Depart through this sign
of the holy cross... -Depart.

1449
01:31:52.507 --> 01:31:53.842
...of our Lord Jesus Christ...

1450
01:31:53.842 --> 01:31:54.676
Depart.

1451
01:31:54.676 --> 01:31:56.177
- ...who lives

1452
01:31:56.177 --> 01:31:58.388
and reigns forever.

1453
01:31:58.388 --> 01:32:00.056
The lion of the tribe of Judah.

1454
01:32:00.056 --> 01:32:02.726
the offspring of David.
has conquered.

1455
01:32:02.726 --> 01:32:04.477
May your mercy. Lord.
descend upon us.

1456
01:32:04.477 --> 01:32:06.521
As great is our hope in you.

1457
01:32:06.521 --> 01:32:08.148
Imperat tibi Deus Pater.

1458
01:32:08.148 --> 01:32:10.775
- Imperat tibi Deus Filius.

1459
01:32:10.775 --> 01:32:12.360
- Imperat tibi...

1460
01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:14.612
...Deus Spiritus Sanctus.

1461
01:32:14.612 --> 01:32:17.907
Imperat tibi Christus.

1462
01:32:17.907 --> 01:32:19.033
Aeter...

1463
01:32:37.385 --> 01:32:39.512
Oh!

1464
01:32:39.512 --> 01:32:42.348
- No!
No!

1465
01:32:42.348 --> 01:32:44.309
Tony?

1466
01:32:53.067 --> 01:32:54.527
No! No. no.

1467
01:32:54.527 --> 01:32:56.154
No. please. God.

1468
01:32:56.154 --> 01:32:58.948
No. No.

1469
01:32:58.948 --> 01:33:00.617
Angela. listen.
that's your mother's scarf.

1470
01:33:00.617 --> 01:33:02.035
Don't touch her!
- No. no. no!

1471
01:33:02.035 --> 01:33:03.411
- That's your mother's scarf.
- Don't touch her.

1472
01:33:03.411 --> 01:33:04.204
- And she loved you.
- Come on.

1473
01:33:04.204 --> 01:33:05.580
And I love you.

1474
01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:07.123
And I'm sorry
I took the scarf from you.

1475
01:33:07.123 --> 01:33:09.501
I'm sorry I took it from you.
but you are in there.

1476
01:33:09.501 --> 01:33:10.752
But you come home.

1477
01:33:10.752 --> 01:33:13.046
Angela. you come
where you can hear me.

1478
01:33:14.297 --> 01:33:15.590
Hey.

1479
01:33:16.382 --> 01:33:17.467
Hey.

1480
01:33:18.676 --> 01:33:19.969
Their heartbeats.

1481
01:33:19.969 --> 01:33:21.596
There are two heartbeats.
Is it working?

1482
01:33:21.596 --> 01:33:22.806
It's working.

1483
01:33:22.806 --> 01:33:23.890
I know you can hear me.

1484
01:33:23.890 --> 01:33:25.141
Now. we will get through this.

1485
01:33:25.141 --> 01:33:26.810
If you don't make it.
I don't make it.

1486
01:33:26.810 --> 01:33:29.145
All right? Come on home.

1487
01:33:30.939 --> 01:33:33.983
She loved you. and I love you.

1488
01:33:35.902 --> 01:33:38.905
KATHERINE
What about me?

1489
01:33:38.905 --> 01:33:40.365
Mommy?

1490
01:33:41.574 --> 01:33:43.117
Daddy?

1491
01:33:44.327 --> 01:33:46.663
I don't want to die.

1492
01:33:50.583 --> 01:33:52.043
I choose you. Katherine!

1493
01:33:52.043 --> 01:33:53.628
Tony...

1494
01:33:53.628 --> 01:33:54.921

You can't!

- Angela. Angela.
I... Okay. I'm getting...

1500
01:34:03.513 --> 01:34:04.764
- Angela. Angela.
- Get those straps off.

1501
01:34:04.764 --> 01:34:06.015
She's gonna be okay.

1502
01:34:06.015 --> 01:34:07.725
- She's gonna be okay.
Angela?

1503
01:34:07.725 --> 01:34:09.686
- Ange?
- I'm trying. I-I g...

1504
01:34:09.686 --> 01:34:11.062
Pull it.
I've got it.

1505
01:34:11.062 --> 01:34:12.689
Angela? Angela?
Harder.

1506
01:34:12.689 --> 01:34:13.815
What's happening?

1507

Angela? Angela?

1508
01:34:15.149 --> 01:34:16.276

01:35:42.236 --> 01:35:43.404
Angela!

1510
01:35:51.913 --> 01:35:52.956
Baby?

1511
01:35:52.956 --> 01:35:55.249
Oh. Mommy... Mommy's right here.

1512
01:35:55.249 --> 01:35:56.459

I'm right here. baby.

1514
01:35:57.710 --> 01:35:58.753
KATHERINE
Mommy. I'm cold.

1515
01:35:58.753 --> 01:35:59.754
Help me! Help her.

1516
01:35:59.754 --> 01:36:01.089
Please help.

1517
01:36:01.089 --> 01:36:02.256
- Mommy.
Get her out of here.

1518
01:36:02.256 --> 01:36:04.008
We're gonna get you out.

- Katherine. baby. Katherine.
Sweetheart?

1523
01:36:20.483 --> 01:36:22.735
Mama?

1524
01:36:22.735 --> 01:36:23.945
- Mama?
Mommy.

1525
01:36:23.945 --> 01:36:25.113
Mommy. Mommy.

1526
01:36:25.113 --> 01:36:27.991
- Mama? Mama?
- Mommy.

1527
01:36:27.991 --> 01:36:29.784
Baby. please wake up.
Please. Mommy's right here.

1528
01:36:29.784 --> 01:36:31.119
- Come on.
I choose you. Katherine!

1529
01:36:31.119 --> 01:36:33.579
Mommy. Mama. where'd you go?

1530
01:36:33.579 --> 01:36:36.249
I choose you.
Katherine. -Mommy. I'm in...

1531
01:36:47.135 --> 01:36:47.969

She's not breathing.
Katherine's not breathing.

Let's get her up.
No. no. no. no. no!

1538
01:37:12.493 --> 01:37:14.078
Katherine. Katherine.
- Hey. hey. hey. Wake up.

1539
01:37:14.078 --> 01:37:15.371
We've been tricked.
We've been tricked.

01:37:15.371 --> 01:37:17.123

1544
01:37:22.503 --> 01:37:24.338
Hey. Hey.

1545
01:37:26.674 --> 01:37:28.009
Hey. wake up!

1546
01:37:28.009 --> 01:37:29.635
Hey. Baby.

1547
01:37:31.012 --> 01:37:32.346
Katherine!

1548
01:37:32.346 --> 01:37:34.057
- Let's get her up.
- Come on. Come on.

1549
01:37:34.057 --> 01:37:35.600
- Come on. Get her up. please!
I chose you!

1550
01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:37.351
- Can somebody help us?
- Come on. Let's get her up.

1551
01:37:37.351 --> 01:37:38.895
- Come on. Up. up. up. up.

1552
01:37:38.895 --> 01:37:40.313
Up. up. up.

1553
01:37:40.313 --> 01:37:41.606
- Hold her head. Hold her.

1554
01:37:41.606 --> 01:37:42.982

1555
01:37:42.982 --> 01:37:44.192
- I got her.
Come on. come on.

1556
01:37:44.192 --> 01:37:45.568
All right. Out of the way.

1557
01:37:45.568 --> 01:37:46.527
Hey.
Mommy's right here. Come on.

1558
01:37:53.785 --> 01:37:55.870
Somebody help us!

1559
01:38:01.417 --> 01:38:03.753
I did not do this.
Wake up. baby.

1560
01:38:03.753 --> 01:38:05.171
Hurry. hurry.

1561
01:38:05.171 --> 01:38:06.380
Wake up.
Mommy's right here. Come on.

1562
01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:08.049
We have an emergency.

1563
01:38:08.049 --> 01:38:09.383
Um. a young girl is going
into cardiac arrest.

1564
01:38:09.383 --> 01:38:12.386
Send the paramedics
and an ambulance now.

1565
01:38:13.971 --> 01:38:15.056
Out of the way.

1566
01:38:17.475 --> 01:38:18.476
And...

1567
01:38:18.476 --> 01:38:20.061
clear!

1568
01:38:28.236 --> 01:38:29.987
Patience obtains all things.

1569
01:38:29.987 --> 01:38:31.572
All things will pass away.

1570
01:38:33.574 --> 01:38:35.243
God never changes.

1571
01:38:57.014 --> 01:38:58.933
Hey. Dispatch. we've got

1572
01:38:58.933 --> 01:39:00.518
a 13-year-old female
that's conscious...

1573
01:39:00.518 --> 01:39:02.770
Can I check your pulse. please?

1574
01:39:02.770 --> 01:39:04.522
...cuts to her body.

1575
01:39:04.522 --> 01:39:06.274
Go ahead and start...

1576
01:39:06.274 --> 01:39:07.650
What I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna check your pulse

1577
01:39:07.650 --> 01:39:09.402
and your breathing. okay?

1578
01:39:09.402 --> 01:39:11.445
Can you do me a big favor
and breathe in?

1579
01:39:11.445 --> 01:39:13.823
Just trying to
figure out what's going on.

1580
01:39:19.370 --> 01:39:21.622
Can I check your pulse?

1581
01:39:30.548 --> 01:39:32.758
Look. I'm sorry
about what's gone on here.

1582
01:39:32.758 --> 01:39:34.343
I'm sorry. We're all just...

1583
01:39:34.343 --> 01:39:36.387
Hey. Stuart. Do you
mind if I call you Stuart?

1584
01:39:36.387 --> 01:39:38.598
Is there anything
that we can do for you

1585
01:39:38.598 --> 01:39:40.474
at this time?

1586
01:39:44.604 --> 01:39:46.647
Sh-She's gone.
I know she's gone.

1587
01:39:46.647 --> 01:39:48.649
Don't touch her.
It's okay. Tony.

1588
01:39:48.649 --> 01:39:50.109
She's gone.

1589
01:40:21.682 --> 01:40:24.310
We should wait
for your counsel to continue.

1590
01:40:25.478 --> 01:40:28.064
Do you think
they'll make it through this?

1591
01:40:30.358 --> 01:40:33.527
I've seen families recover
from things you can't imagine.

1592
01:40:37.365 --> 01:40:39.575
What do you think evil is?

1593
01:40:42.912 --> 01:40:45.206
I'll tell you
what I think it is.

1594
01:40:46.499 --> 01:40:49.543
I think that we're born
in this world

1595
01:40:49.543 --> 01:40:52.171
with hope and dreams

1596
01:40:52.171 --> 01:40:54.382
and a desire to be happy.

1597
01:40:54.382 --> 01:40:57.009
And the devil has one wish:

1598
01:40:57.009 --> 01:40:58.719
make us give up.

1599
01:41:05.643 --> 01:41:07.103
Like Job.

1600
01:41:07.103 --> 01:41:09.480
like Job in the desert.

1601
01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:10.815
we can endure.

1602
01:41:10.815 --> 01:41:13.192
We can heal.

1603
01:41:16.821 --> 01:41:19.740
For some of us.
it'll be harder than others.

1604
01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:22.618
For some of us...

1605
01:41:24.078 --> 01:41:27.206
...it'll take a lot longer
to find that peace.

1606
01:41:29.292 --> 01:41:32.378
But that peace. too.
will be a choice.

1607
01:41:38.592 --> 01:41:42.513
A choice to find the blessings
all around us.

1608
01:41:44.348 --> 01:41:46.767
We carry those with us.

1609
01:41:48.769 --> 01:41:50.521
I love you so much.

1610
01:41:56.485 --> 01:42:00.740
And maybe that's
all God-- any god--

1611
01:42:00.740 --> 01:42:03.451
or any good person
really wants from us.

1612
01:42:04.201 --> 01:42:06.245
Just to keep going.

1613
01:42:06.996 --> 01:42:08.622
To make the choice

1614
01:42:08.622 --> 01:42:12.877
to hold on tight
and never let go.

1615
01:42:12.877 --> 01:42:15.129
To believe.

1616
01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:22.636
Victor. is that you?

1617
01:42:36.984 --> 01:42:38.819
No. Mom.

1618
01:42:38.819 --> 01:42:40.488
- It's me.

1619
01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:44.617
Regan.
