3
00:00:56.482 --> 00:00:58.000
- Hey. come here.

4
00:00:59.103 --> 00:00:59.931
I got you.

5
00:01:11.827 --> 00:01:12.689
The same one?

6
00:01:19.137 --> 00:01:20.724
You wanna talk about it?

7
00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:33.517
- It just...

8
00:01:35.551 --> 00:01:36.724
It felt so vivid.

9
00:01:40.793 --> 00:01:42.379
Like I could feel it.

10
00:01:45.241 --> 00:01:47.241
I was drowning.

11
00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:50.137
And I think someone was
trying to help me this time.

12
00:01:50.172 --> 00:01:51.793
- Really?

13
00:01:51.827 --> 00:01:56.482
Who was it?

14
00:01:58.206 --> 00:01:59.448
- I don't know.

15
00:02:02.517 --> 00:02:04.448
I couldn't see anything.

16
00:02:04.482 --> 00:02:05.655
There was blood everywhere.

17
00:02:08.275 --> 00:02:09.896
But I could feel him.

18
00:02:14.655 --> 00:02:15.482
- Him?

19
00:02:23.827 --> 00:02:24.896
- I don't know.

20
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.517
- Babe. we're gonna get
through this. all right?

21
00:02:31.241 --> 00:02:32.379
- What if we don't?

22
00:02:32.413 --> 00:02:34.931
- We don't have any choice.

23
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.206
We gotta get through this.

24
00:02:49.724 --> 00:02:53.172
- You're such an optimist.

25
00:02:53.241 --> 00:02:55.206
- With a dash of love.

26
00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:56.517
Of course.

27
00:02:56.586 --> 00:02:57.931
Mm.

28
00:02:57.965 --> 00:02:59.620
Let's get your meds.

29
00:03:01.655 --> 00:03:03.000
- No. I made up my mind.

30
00:03:03.034 --> 00:03:04.931
I'm not going to...

31
00:03:04.965 --> 00:03:06.379
- Going to what?

32
00:03:06.413 --> 00:03:07.241
Take them?

33
00:03:08.586 --> 00:03:11.241
- Will you just hear me out?

34
00:03:11.931 --> 00:03:12.758
Okay?

35
00:03:13.724 --> 00:03:14.551
They...

36
00:03:16.965 --> 00:03:19.620
They make me lethargic.

37
00:03:21.517 --> 00:03:25.448
Like. sometimes I can't even
function or do simple things.

38
00:03:25.448 --> 00:03:27.827
- And that's just because
you're stressed out. all right?

39
00:03:27.862 --> 00:03:29.724
You're working a lot.
between the shop.

40
00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:30.620
with Jada. with me.

41
00:03:32.413 --> 00:03:34.275
And you can't be every
woman all the time. babe.

42
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.655
- Bryce. I made up my mind.

43
00:03:45.482 --> 00:03:48.482
- And that's it? No discussion?

44
00:03:48.551 --> 00:03:51.620
No thought on how
this ended last time

45
00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:52.448
with you going--

46
00:03:52.517 --> 00:03:53.482
- Don't. Don't.

47
00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:55.413
- No.

48
00:03:55.413 --> 00:03:56.931
- Don't go there.

49
00:03:56.931 --> 00:03:58.724
- No. we've already moved in
now and unpacked our shit.

50
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.931
The last tango
around you sneaking

51
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:04.034
and not taking your
medication resulted

52
00:04:04.068 --> 00:04:05.827
in your agoraphobia
making you believe

53
00:04:05.827 --> 00:04:07.586
you were trapped in your car.

54
00:04:07.655 --> 00:04:08.793
You punched out the window.

55
00:04:08.862 --> 00:04:10.551
That's how you got
the scar on your hand.

56
00:04:10.586 --> 00:04:14.620
You ran for blocks on end.
Faith. until you collapsed.

57
00:04:14.655 --> 00:04:17.793
Is that what you wanna
relive. day in and day out?

58
00:04:17.827 --> 00:04:19.827
That's the experience we
wanna give our daughter?

59
00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:38.517
Babe.

60
00:04:40.965 --> 00:04:43.000
I'm begging you. please.

61
00:04:45.068 --> 00:04:49.482
Take the medication so we
can start our day in peace.

62
00:05:10.586 --> 00:05:12.724
I love you and you know this.

63
00:05:14.862 --> 00:05:16.413
This is what's best.

64
00:05:29.517 --> 00:05:31.724
Jada! It's time for
school. monster!

65
00:06:26.862 --> 00:06:28.000
- Can I join you?

66
00:06:55.517 --> 00:06:56.758
Good morning my loves.

67
00:06:57.896 --> 00:06:59.586
Good morning. princess.

68
00:06:59.655 --> 00:07:00.724
Muah!

69
00:07:00.724 --> 00:07:02.172
- Morning. daddy.

70
00:07:02.241 --> 00:07:04.068
- Morning. darling.

71
00:07:08.275 --> 00:07:11.275
And I believe I already
gave you a good morning.

72
00:07:11.275 --> 00:07:13.000
- Oh. is that so?

73
00:07:13.034 --> 00:07:13.862
- Mm-hm.

74
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.137
- Good morning and welcome
to New Day World News.

75
00:07:20.137 --> 00:07:22.862
Joining me this morning
is presidential candidate

76
00:07:22.896 --> 00:07:26.275
and retired four-star
general. Michelle Dupree.

77
00:07:26.344 --> 00:07:27.586
She is best known--

78
00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:29.103
- Babe.
- Hm?

79
00:07:29.172 --> 00:07:30.586
- For leading a successful
mission into Afghanistan

80
00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.551
and the take down
of the OCI regime.

81
00:07:32.586 --> 00:07:34.034
A terrorist organization--

82
00:07:34.068 --> 00:07:34.862
- Babe. did you remember--

83
00:07:34.862 --> 00:07:35.965
- Just give me a second.

84
00:07:36.034 --> 00:07:37.137
- By
overthrowing and killing

85
00:07:37.206 --> 00:07:40.758
then President
Abdur-Raheem Zalmai.

86
00:07:40.758 --> 00:07:42.758
Welcome to New Day.
General Dupree.

87
00:07:42.758 --> 00:07:44.862
and congratulations on
your recent retirement

88
00:07:44.931 --> 00:07:47.551
and of course. your
bid for the presidency.

89
00:07:47.551 --> 00:07:48.793
- Thank you for having me.

90
00:07:48.827 --> 00:07:51.620
That was quite an introduction.

91
00:07:51.655 --> 00:07:53.103
You know. Lydia. one
of the things that I

92
00:07:53.103 --> 00:07:55.931
am most proud of was
being able to assist

93
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.137
the new democratically elected
president of Afghanistan

94
00:07:59.137 --> 00:08:01.034
with taking power.

95
00:08:01.034 --> 00:08:02.896
It's a great addition
to my life's work

96
00:08:02.931 --> 00:08:05.241
to see the Afghani people
receive the liberation

97
00:08:05.275 --> 00:08:07.586
and leadership they
so rightly deserve.

98
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:10.655
- I was watching that.

99
00:08:10.724 --> 00:08:11.931
- Exactly.

100
00:08:11.965 --> 00:08:15.620
Meanwhile. your husband
and our daughter

101
00:08:15.655 --> 00:08:17.172
have been trying to
get your attention.

102
00:08:18.793 --> 00:08:21.137
Did you remember to make
arrangements for Jada?

103
00:08:21.172 --> 00:08:23.137
You know she has a half
day at school today.

104
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:26.620
- Oh my god. Bryce. I forgot.

105
00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:27.827
Can you please call in?

106
00:08:27.862 --> 00:08:30.586
- No. we talked about this.

107
00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.862
I told you. I have
patients all day today.

108
00:08:32.896 --> 00:08:34.758
Which is why you
agreed this morning

109
00:08:34.827 --> 00:08:36.517
that you would figure it out.

110
00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.862
- I know. I meant to.

111
00:08:39.862 --> 00:08:42.172
And I just got distracted.

112
00:08:44.379 --> 00:08:45.689
You know that general on TV?

113
00:08:45.758 --> 00:08:48.896
She looks. like.
really familiar to me.

114
00:08:50.241 --> 00:08:52.068
- That's because
she's always on TV.

115
00:08:52.103 --> 00:08:54.965
And you're a news
hound and that's that.

116
00:08:57.206 --> 00:08:58.000
- Right.

117
00:08:59.344 --> 00:09:01.827
So a half a day. huh. Jada?

118
00:09:01.862 --> 00:09:04.724
Look. mommy has to
work late. okay?

119
00:09:04.724 --> 00:09:07.275
Because there's inventory
coming into the store

120
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:09.068
and I gotta close.

121
00:09:09.103 --> 00:09:11.000
Karena asked for
the evening off.

122
00:09:11.068 --> 00:09:11.827
- Karena?

123
00:09:11.896 --> 00:09:13.103
- Mm-hm.

124
00:09:13.137 --> 00:09:14.241
- Who's that?

125
00:09:14.275 --> 00:09:15.241
- Yeah. she's my new employee.

126
00:09:15.275 --> 00:09:16.586
She's so good.

127
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.620
- What happened to Melissa?

128
00:09:20.655 --> 00:09:21.862
- Ugh. she was terrible.

129
00:09:21.931 --> 00:09:24.965
Had no customer
service experience.

130
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.689
I mean. she just felt
like she was too good

131
00:09:27.724 --> 00:09:28.689
to touch people's feet.

132
00:09:28.724 --> 00:09:29.793
So I was like. listen girl.

133
00:09:29.827 --> 00:09:31.172
go be a rocket
scientist or something.

134
00:09:31.206 --> 00:09:32.827
Since you wanna act
like you're just

135
00:09:32.862 --> 00:09:34.827
too good to do anything.

136
00:09:34.827 --> 00:09:38.310
- I thought we agreed to
select new employees together.

137
00:09:38.344 --> 00:09:40.172
- We did.

138
00:09:40.172 --> 00:09:42.689
But I needed someone right away.

139
00:09:42.724 --> 00:09:43.896
Karena it is.

140
00:09:47.413 --> 00:09:48.586
It's not a big deal.

141
00:09:49.862 --> 00:09:53.413
Look. how about I text Miss Amy

142
00:09:53.448 --> 00:09:54.965
about picking you up for us?

143
00:09:55.896 --> 00:09:57.931
- Miss Amy to the rescue!

144
00:09:57.965 --> 00:10:00.241
And I'll get to play
with her puppies.

145
00:10:00.275 --> 00:10:01.655
- Mm-hm.

146
00:10:03.241 --> 00:10:04.862
Done.

147
00:10:04.931 --> 00:10:06.068
- Jada gets what she wants.

148
00:10:07.379 --> 00:10:08.724
All the time.

149
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.965
- Eat all your carrots today.

150
00:10:12.965 --> 00:10:13.793
Promise?

151
00:10:14.965 --> 00:10:16.344
Good.

152
00:10:16.379 --> 00:10:17.172
- That's my baby.

153
00:10:32.206 --> 00:10:33.241
- Whew.

154
00:11:03.068 --> 00:11:06.241
- Yeah. I need these.
I'm coming back for you.

155
00:11:06.241 --> 00:11:07.000
Faith.

156
00:11:08.758 --> 00:11:10.068
Guess who has a date?

157
00:11:13.448 --> 00:11:14.275
Okay. I'm just gonna tell you.

158
00:11:14.275 --> 00:11:15.448
You're taking too long.

159
00:11:15.482 --> 00:11:16.379
My grandma.

160
00:11:17.827 --> 00:11:18.448
- What?

161
00:11:18.448 --> 00:11:19.896
- You heard me.

162
00:11:19.965 --> 00:11:21.724
Granny said she
met a man online.

163
00:11:21.758 --> 00:11:24.896
She liked him and they
went on a few dates.

164
00:11:24.931 --> 00:11:27.517
So she gonna live her best life.

165
00:11:27.517 --> 00:11:31.931
So. she can't babysit
my son tomorrow.

166
00:11:35.379 --> 00:11:38.379
- Okay. so Mr.
Steal-Your-Grandmother
is in full effect?

167
00:11:38.413 --> 00:11:40.344
- Pretty much. yeah.

168
00:11:40.413 --> 00:11:42.413
- All right. well. that's okay

169
00:11:42.448 --> 00:11:43.896
because I have a
sitter for Jada tonight

170
00:11:43.896 --> 00:11:45.068
and I did plan on closing.

171
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.965
And I'll just figure some
things out for tomorrow.

172
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.137
- Okay. oof!

173
00:11:50.172 --> 00:11:51.689
I'm getting out of here.

174
00:11:51.758 --> 00:11:53.206
Thank you. Faith. girl.

175
00:11:53.275 --> 00:11:54.379
- Mm-hm!

176
00:11:54.448 --> 00:11:55.310
- Best boss ever.

177
00:11:55.344 --> 00:11:56.172
- Mm-hm!

178
00:11:57.517 --> 00:12:00.000
- Oh shit. Um. and
can you clock me out?

179
00:12:02.275 --> 00:12:03.413
Okay.

180
00:12:04.862 --> 00:12:06.068
Oh. I'm so sorry.

181
00:12:06.103 --> 00:12:07.344
I did not even see you.

182
00:12:07.344 --> 00:12:09.068
- It's fine.

183
00:12:09.068 --> 00:12:11.896
I was actually just going
to ask for directions.

184
00:12:11.896 --> 00:12:15.758
My phone died and this
was my navigation.

185
00:12:15.793 --> 00:12:17.103
- Happens to me all the time.

186
00:12:17.103 --> 00:12:20.379
Look. all you do is
exit the parking lot.

187
00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:23.379
make a left. and you'll
see the signs. okay?

188
00:12:23.448 --> 00:12:24.310
- Thank you.

189
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:25.137
- You're welcome. bye.

190
00:12:44.379 --> 00:12:47.344
- I'll just get right to it.

191
00:12:47.344 --> 00:12:48.413
Dupree can't be trusted.

192
00:12:50.413 --> 00:12:51.931
- You're just figuring that out?

193
00:12:53.965 --> 00:12:56.793
Listen. I know she was
your father's right hand.

194
00:12:58.482 --> 00:13:00.206
He prided himself on maintaining

195
00:13:00.275 --> 00:13:02.275
these powerful connections
and he worked hard

196
00:13:02.344 --> 00:13:04.103
to construct this
impressive empire

197
00:13:04.137 --> 00:13:06.103
of Afghan heroin
but that Dupree...

198
00:13:06.137 --> 00:13:08.241
- Yeah. but since his
death. Dupree's changed.

199
00:13:08.275 --> 00:13:09.103
- Yeah.

200
00:13:10.448 --> 00:13:11.379
- She's quieter.

201
00:13:13.241 --> 00:13:15.379
Gained a lot more power
in a short amount of time.

202
00:13:15.413 --> 00:13:16.931
- Mm.

203
00:13:16.965 --> 00:13:19.344
- It's part of the
reason I relocated.

204
00:13:19.413 --> 00:13:21.517
You know. the main office
from New York to LA.

205
00:13:23.586 --> 00:13:24.172
Dupree's here.

206
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:26.965
And I've got a feeling
she's setting something up

207
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.379
to take us out. undercut us.

208
00:13:33.482 --> 00:13:34.965
You don't think she's
running for president

209
00:13:34.965 --> 00:13:36.448
for the betterment
of the people do you?

210
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:55.827
- Oh!

211
00:13:55.827 --> 00:13:57.413
- Bravo. General. Bravo.

212
00:14:00.448 --> 00:14:01.448
- Mr. Secretary.

213
00:14:03.206 --> 00:14:04.344
- You told me every
one of those soldiers

214
00:14:04.379 --> 00:14:06.448
in that unit was dead.

215
00:14:06.517 --> 00:14:10.344
Thomas Richardson. suicide.
shot himself in the head.

216
00:14:10.379 --> 00:14:14.379
Carol Davinson. alcohol
poisoning. drank
herself to death.

217
00:14:14.379 --> 00:14:18.137
Marilyn Roman. electrocuted
in a freak accident.

218
00:14:18.206 --> 00:14:21.034
And Imani Avant drowned.

219
00:14:22.965 --> 00:14:23.896
Allegedly.

220
00:14:32.931 --> 00:14:34.137
- This is impossible.

221
00:14:37.551 --> 00:14:38.965
Uh.

222
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
- Now fix it.

223
00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:25.931
- I need a moment.

224
00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.206
- You got it. boss.

225
00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:45.448
- Dominique.

226
00:15:47.482 --> 00:15:49.000
I need to see you.

227
00:16:17.068 --> 00:16:22.137
Come here. baby.

228
00:16:22.827 --> 00:16:24.379
- You called for me?

229
00:16:24.413 --> 00:16:25.551
- Mm. oh. I did.

230
00:16:28.862 --> 00:16:30.551
- I'm here.

231
00:16:30.586 --> 00:16:32.206
- I missed you.

232
00:16:32.206 --> 00:16:33.482
- Missed you. too.

233
00:16:50.068 --> 00:16:51.275
- So I just got a call.

234
00:16:52.448 --> 00:16:53.275
- Okay.

235
00:16:57.413 --> 00:16:59.379
Ah.

236
00:16:59.413 --> 00:17:00.068
- And it contradicts every
fucking thing you told me

237
00:17:00.103 --> 00:17:01.655
about Imani's death. bitch.

238
00:17:03.551 --> 00:17:04.379
Is she alive?

239
00:17:05.758 --> 00:17:06.827
- I promise.

240
00:17:06.862 --> 00:17:08.310
I swear she's dead.

241
00:17:09.448 --> 00:17:10.275
I swear.

242
00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:21.448
You asked me to protect
the family and I did.

243
00:17:22.827 --> 00:17:24.344
At all costs.

244
00:17:26.344 --> 00:17:28.310
Imani betrayed all
of us. remember?

245
00:17:30.448 --> 00:17:32.275
Remember? Remember that?

246
00:17:33.586 --> 00:17:34.620
She had to pay.

247
00:17:36.206 --> 00:17:37.517
This has to be a mistake.

248
00:17:45.896 --> 00:17:50.620
- For your sake. I
hope it is. bitch.

249
00:17:51.586 --> 00:17:52.413
Now get the fuck off me!

250
00:17:55.586 --> 00:17:57.379
Get your shit and get out.

251
00:18:21.896 --> 00:18:22.724
- Hello.

252
00:18:23.965 --> 00:18:26.241
- Scarlet never lost her letter.

253
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:27.379
- Really?

254
00:18:27.448 --> 00:18:28.275
- Absolutely.

255
00:18:32.344 --> 00:18:33.482
- So. no wet bird?

256
00:18:34.517 --> 00:18:35.758
- I have no fucking idea.

257
00:18:37.275 --> 00:18:38.517
But I need you to go look.

258
00:18:39.758 --> 00:18:40.448
- Where?

259
00:18:42.241 --> 00:18:43.241
- I'll text you the rest.

260
00:19:33.827 --> 00:19:34.827
- Don't move.

261
00:19:34.862 --> 00:19:36.275
- Wait. wait.

262
00:19:36.344 --> 00:19:36.827
Wait. you can have
whatever you want.

263
00:19:36.862 --> 00:19:38.241
- Get down!

264
00:19:38.275 --> 00:19:39.034
- You can have
whatever you want!

265
00:19:39.034 --> 00:19:39.931
I promise you. I don't. ah!

266
00:19:40.931 --> 00:19:41.931
- Stay down!

267
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.896
I told you not to move.

268
00:19:51.586 --> 00:19:54.965
- Keep
'em up. keep 'em up.

269
00:19:56.896 --> 00:19:58.379
- Clear.

270
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.793
- Is that crystal clear?

271
00:20:04.931 --> 00:20:05.931
- Near the front door.

272
00:20:05.965 --> 00:20:06.827
Near the front door.

273
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.620
- Stay right there.

274
00:22:05.931 --> 00:22:07.517
- I should have both
of your fucking heads

275
00:22:07.517 --> 00:22:08.620
right here. right now.

276
00:22:14.931 --> 00:22:17.034
- You look like you
could use a meal.

277
00:22:17.103 --> 00:22:18.689
You want some?

278
00:22:18.724 --> 00:22:20.000
- Your father gave
you one fucking job.

279
00:22:20.034 --> 00:22:21.758
One.

280
00:22:21.793 --> 00:22:23.517
To be a good son.

281
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.689
But you couldn't
even handle that.

282
00:22:27.965 --> 00:22:31.000
I mean my god. Raymond
handed you everything.

283
00:22:32.068 --> 00:22:34.827
Money. his multi-million dollar

284
00:22:34.862 --> 00:22:36.758
liquor distribution business.

285
00:22:36.827 --> 00:22:39.000
his connections. Afghanistan.

286
00:22:40.068 --> 00:22:40.896
Me.

287
00:22:44.068 --> 00:22:47.586
But no matter how much he
loved you and took care of you.

288
00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:49.620
and even though you
were his junior.

289
00:22:51.482 --> 00:22:53.551
there's still one thing
he couldn't teach you.

290
00:22:54.965 --> 00:22:55.586
Loyalty.

291
00:23:06.068 --> 00:23:08.517
Your sister was not only
a better soldier than you.

292
00:23:10.482 --> 00:23:12.172
she was more of a man
than you'll ever be.

293
00:23:15.965 --> 00:23:17.827
So maybe she should
have been left alive.

294
00:23:21.965 --> 00:23:22.965
She is dead. right?

295
00:23:29.172 --> 00:23:31.655
Well. you know what they say.

296
00:23:31.655 --> 00:23:34.620
You want something done
right. do it yourself.

297
00:23:36.689 --> 00:23:38.000
- Well. I guess she's dead then.

298
00:23:55.482 --> 00:23:56.551
- You can play this game.

299
00:23:57.931 --> 00:23:59.827
But you and I both know
who loses in the end.

300
00:24:02.517 --> 00:24:03.137
You'll go down.

301
00:24:05.068 --> 00:24:07.172
And so will your
family's entire legacy.

302
00:24:09.172 --> 00:24:09.758
- Hm.

303
00:24:10.758 --> 00:24:12.172
You know. my father always said.

304
00:24:13.758 --> 00:24:15.724
"Those on the
proximity to power"

305
00:24:15.758 --> 00:24:18.931
"are sometimes deluded into
thinking they wield it."

306
00:24:21.137 --> 00:24:24.586
"But in fact. it's the
man standing behind you"

307
00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:26.896
"that decides if you take
that next step or not."

308
00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:40.965
- Are those his final words?

309
00:24:43.137 --> 00:24:45.827
You were the last one to see
your father alive. right?

310
00:24:50.793 --> 00:24:54.862
Strange how he died
so suddenly like that.

311
00:24:57.068 --> 00:24:57.965
With only you there.

312
00:25:16.068 --> 00:25:16.896
- Ha. ha.

313
00:25:18.241 --> 00:25:20.896
Next time have some class and
order the steak medium rare.

314
00:25:27.793 --> 00:25:29.793
And don't fuck up my fundraiser!

315
00:25:52.103 --> 00:25:53.931
- What the hell is this?

316
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:16.000
Looks like a robbery gone wrong.

317
00:26:17.896 --> 00:26:18.862
- Gone wrong is right.

318
00:26:20.724 --> 00:26:21.344
This is professional.

319
00:26:23.379 --> 00:26:24.172
- A gang hit?

320
00:26:25.827 --> 00:26:27.172
- From the looks of
this. more than that.

321
00:26:28.689 --> 00:26:29.862
All these bodies are armed.

322
00:26:32.965 --> 00:26:35.000
All I know is that
whatever it is.

323
00:26:36.137 --> 00:26:37.758
it's ruining my weekend plans.

324
00:26:40.275 --> 00:26:40.896
Any witnesses?

325
00:26:46.413 --> 00:26:47.344
- Just one. sir.

326
00:27:25.206 --> 00:27:26.827
- Sir.

327
00:27:26.862 --> 00:27:28.344
I've been here for hours.

328
00:27:28.379 --> 00:27:31.103
An officer still has not
come and taken my report.

329
00:27:31.172 --> 00:27:32.724
Now I know I don't
have to wait this long

330
00:27:32.758 --> 00:27:34.206
to make a report
for my wife missing.

331
00:27:34.206 --> 00:27:36.482
- Well. is she missing
voluntarily or involuntarily?

332
00:27:36.551 --> 00:27:38.758
I mean. I see husbands everyday.

333
00:27:38.793 --> 00:27:40.000
And don't even get me
started on the wives

334
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000
looking for their husbands.

335
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.034
- My wife is missing!

336
00:27:44.068 --> 00:27:45.793
Okay. she could be in danger.

337
00:27:45.827 --> 00:27:47.172
She doesn't have her medication.

338
00:27:47.241 --> 00:27:48.862
Anything could have happened.

339
00:27:48.896 --> 00:27:51.275
She owns a shoe store. she
shut down. did not come home.

340
00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:52.448
- Which shoe store. sir?

341
00:27:52.482 --> 00:27:54.034
- The Gleaming Slipper.

342
00:27:54.103 --> 00:27:56.000
On the strip mall
right off the freeway.

343
00:27:58.034 --> 00:27:58.965
- Wait right here.

344
00:28:00.344 --> 00:28:01.172
Hey.

345
00:28:03.379 --> 00:28:05.275
Call Hoffman.

346
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:07.000
I think this might
have something to do
with those murders.

347
00:28:07.068 --> 00:28:07.896
- Murders?

348
00:28:17.344 --> 00:28:18.793
- Mr. Dames.

349
00:28:18.827 --> 00:28:19.793
Mr. Avant is in a
meeting right now.

350
00:28:19.827 --> 00:28:20.793
Please. have a seat.

351
00:28:23.517 --> 00:28:25.965
I said. he's in a meeting.

352
00:28:25.965 --> 00:28:28.068
You can't go in there. stop!

353
00:28:28.137 --> 00:28:31.206
Mr. Avant. I
explained to Mr. Dames

354
00:28:31.241 --> 00:28:34.172
that you were in a
meeting and he insisted.

355
00:28:34.206 --> 00:28:35.758
- It's fine. Nola.

356
00:28:35.827 --> 00:28:36.827
- Are you sure?

357
00:28:36.862 --> 00:28:38.241
Because I can call security.

358
00:28:38.275 --> 00:28:39.793
- I am security.

359
00:28:39.793 --> 00:28:40.448
Good day. Nola.

360
00:28:42.931 --> 00:28:45.344
- I promise you.
Nola. it's fine.

361
00:28:50.793 --> 00:28:52.034
Good day. Mr. Dames.

362
00:28:53.379 --> 00:28:54.000
Take a seat.

363
00:28:55.517 --> 00:28:58.482
- What type of fucking
mission are you sending me on?

364
00:28:58.517 --> 00:29:00.413
Are you playing with
me or something?

365
00:29:00.482 --> 00:29:01.068
- What?

366
00:29:02.517 --> 00:29:03.379
I've been waiting
on word from you

367
00:29:03.413 --> 00:29:04.517
since last night and nothing.

368
00:29:05.448 --> 00:29:06.965
So you tell me.

369
00:29:07.034 --> 00:29:08.241
What mission you been on?

370
00:29:08.275 --> 00:29:10.172
- Anytime you've given
me a job. I do it.

371
00:29:12.034 --> 00:29:13.931
I've never given you any
reason to check up on me.

372
00:29:13.965 --> 00:29:15.034
or clean up after me.

373
00:29:15.965 --> 00:29:17.068
And I never needed back up.

374
00:29:17.103 --> 00:29:19.241
- That's why I hired you.

375
00:29:19.275 --> 00:29:22.275
- Yeah. I go to carry out
the job you hired me to do.

376
00:29:22.275 --> 00:29:24.586
And you send a god damn
A-team to the scene before me?

377
00:29:26.103 --> 00:29:26.931
- What?

378
00:29:28.034 --> 00:29:32.896
What the fuck is
he talking about?

379
00:29:32.965 --> 00:29:34.172
- Unless it was you?

380
00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:36.137
- Ha. ha!

381
00:29:36.137 --> 00:29:38.034
You're out of your mind.

382
00:29:38.068 --> 00:29:40.137
Supreme. get your boy. man.

383
00:29:42.344 --> 00:29:44.965
- See. maybe you
nervous. scared.

384
00:29:45.931 --> 00:29:47.034
that I'm getting too close.

385
00:29:49.551 --> 00:29:52.172
Close enough to take your
place and push you out the way.

386
00:29:53.275 --> 00:29:55.551
So you send me into an ambush.

387
00:29:55.551 --> 00:29:56.482
- Two things. boy.

388
00:29:58.068 --> 00:30:01.000
One. you could never
take my fucking place.

389
00:30:01.034 --> 00:30:03.862
And I don't send mother
fuckers to kill. they send me.

390
00:30:03.896 --> 00:30:05.310
So calm your ass
down and leave me out

391
00:30:05.344 --> 00:30:07.413
of whatever bullshit
you really got going on.

392
00:30:08.931 --> 00:30:12.482
- Fellas. this is real cute.

393
00:30:12.482 --> 00:30:13.965
I hate to break this up.

394
00:30:13.965 --> 00:30:16.896
But somebody better tell
me what's going on now.

395
00:30:16.965 --> 00:30:17.482
Talk!

396
00:30:17.517 --> 00:30:18.482
Where's she at?

397
00:30:18.517 --> 00:30:19.344
- She got away.

398
00:30:22.344 --> 00:30:23.275
- Fuck.

399
00:30:23.344 --> 00:30:24.172
- And it definitely was her.

400
00:30:25.482 --> 00:30:26.034
- So what now?

401
00:30:27.448 --> 00:30:28.931
- What you mean. what now?

402
00:30:30.206 --> 00:30:33.068
I'll find her. I'll
execute her. period.

403
00:30:36.172 --> 00:30:38.034
- Yeah. that's
exactly what we'll do.

404
00:30:39.241 --> 00:30:41.931
But first we're gonna
let her come to us.

405
00:30:41.965 --> 00:30:43.827
If there's one thing
I know about Dorothy.

406
00:30:45.206 --> 00:30:46.344
that bitch will always
find her way home.

407
00:31:10.448 --> 00:31:12.931
- It's only me and you. Imani.

408
00:32:00.551 --> 00:32:01.172
- Ah!

409
00:32:12.241 --> 00:32:13.034
Oh shit.

410
00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:29.724
- Mr. Newford.

411
00:32:29.793 --> 00:32:30.655
I'm detective Hoffman.

412
00:32:32.586 --> 00:32:34.344
We'd like to show
you some footage.

413
00:32:34.379 --> 00:32:35.620
- Footage of what?

414
00:32:35.689 --> 00:32:37.344
- An incident that
occurred last night.

415
00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:41.068
Maybe it'll shine some light

416
00:32:41.103 --> 00:32:42.206
on where your wife is.

417
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:07.241
Is that your wife?

418
00:33:09.413 --> 00:33:10.620
- That's not the wife I know.

419
00:33:31.068 --> 00:33:31.724
- Can I help you?

420
00:33:33.517 --> 00:33:35.620
- Who are you and why
are you in my house?

421
00:33:35.655 --> 00:33:36.448
- Excuse me?

422
00:33:38.413 --> 00:33:40.379
- Where's Bryce and Jada?

423
00:33:40.413 --> 00:33:42.206
- Ma'am. ma'am.

424
00:33:42.241 --> 00:33:43.758
You probably got
the wrong address.

425
00:33:43.827 --> 00:33:45.517
- Are you fucking crazy?

426
00:33:45.517 --> 00:33:46.724
- Ma'am are you okay?

427
00:33:46.758 --> 00:33:48.206
- I live here. where
the fuck is my family?

428
00:33:48.241 --> 00:33:49.137
- Ma'am. hey. hey. hey.

429
00:33:49.206 --> 00:33:50.137
Are you all right?

430
00:33:50.206 --> 00:33:51.137
- Honey. is everything okay?

431
00:33:51.206 --> 00:33:52.206
I heard yelling.

432
00:33:52.206 --> 00:33:53.551
- No. baby. it's all right.

433
00:33:53.586 --> 00:33:54.551
I'm gonna handle this.

434
00:33:54.551 --> 00:33:55.586
- And she's in my fucking robe.

435
00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:56.137
What the fuck is--
- Hey!

436
00:33:58.172 --> 00:33:59.724
- Where the fuck is my family?

437
00:33:59.724 --> 00:34:01.137
- Ah!

438
00:34:01.137 --> 00:34:02.137
- I'm not gonna ask you again.

439
00:34:02.137 --> 00:34:03.206
- I'm on with the police.

440
00:34:03.241 --> 00:34:04.724
- Call them.

441
00:34:04.758 --> 00:34:06.344
This is my fucking house.
they'll figure this shit out.

442
00:34:06.379 --> 00:34:08.137
- Hurry. please. she's
attacking us now.

443
00:35:28.482 --> 00:35:29.724
- Bryce.

444
00:35:29.724 --> 00:35:32.896
- Daddy. daddy! Where's Mommy?

445
00:35:32.896 --> 00:35:34.586
- Hey. baby.

446
00:35:34.586 --> 00:35:36.758
Uh. Mommy's gonna
be home soon. okay?

447
00:35:36.793 --> 00:35:38.620
I promise that.

448
00:35:38.655 --> 00:35:40.448
But guess what?

449
00:35:40.482 --> 00:35:41.724
- What?

450
00:35:41.793 --> 00:35:43.448
- So you know. you
love the lake house.

451
00:35:44.551 --> 00:35:45.827
- Yes.

452
00:35:45.827 --> 00:35:47.482
- Amy's gonna take
you to the lake house

453
00:35:47.482 --> 00:35:50.241
and Mommy and I will
join you soon. all right?

454
00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:51.724
- Yay. the lake!

455
00:35:51.758 --> 00:35:53.931
- We're gonna
have so much fun.

456
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.482
Let's go pack. okay?

457
00:35:55.482 --> 00:35:56.482
- Okay!

458
00:37:14.413 --> 00:37:15.689
- What the fuck?

459
00:37:34.724 --> 00:37:37.517
- You should not
be on this phone.

460
00:38:17.034 --> 00:38:17.862
- Senator.

461
00:38:22.517 --> 00:38:23.827
- I'm not pleased.

462
00:38:26.689 --> 00:38:28.793
Matter of fact. that's
an understatement.

463
00:38:31.931 --> 00:38:32.862
I'm vexed.

464
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:36.931
I'm quite vexed.

465
00:38:40.586 --> 00:38:43.448
I need to understand how
a veteran CIA officer

466
00:38:43.482 --> 00:38:45.034
allows any of this to happen.

467
00:38:48.103 --> 00:38:50.034
Please. fill me in.

468
00:38:51.931 --> 00:38:54.448
Because the last come to
Jesus moment that we had.

469
00:38:54.482 --> 00:38:57.517
you told me you were weening
her off the medication

470
00:38:57.551 --> 00:38:58.793
and slowly bringing her around.

471
00:38:58.793 --> 00:39:00.586
- Yes. I was bringing
her around but--

472
00:39:00.655 --> 00:39:01.482
- Shh.

473
00:39:03.068 --> 00:39:04.965
I was raised to believe
that anything before

474
00:39:04.965 --> 00:39:06.896
that "but" is bullshit.

475
00:39:08.724 --> 00:39:09.965
So why don't you
do us both a favor

476
00:39:10.034 --> 00:39:13.172
and skip to the part
where somehow. once again.

477
00:39:13.241 --> 00:39:16.172
you led me into a mess that
I have to clean up for you

478
00:39:16.241 --> 00:39:17.793
and your assigned bride.

479
00:39:17.827 --> 00:39:19.000
- If you'll let me
explain. Senator.

480
00:39:19.068 --> 00:39:22.448
- You see. that's
my issue. Alexander.

481
00:39:22.482 --> 00:39:23.689
You're always explaining.

482
00:39:25.137 --> 00:39:28.034
First. you explained
that in order for Avant

483
00:39:28.103 --> 00:39:30.482
to feel that she was
in a normal family.

484
00:39:30.517 --> 00:39:32.482
she needed a child.

485
00:39:32.517 --> 00:39:34.137
So we arranged for
you to adopt one.

486
00:39:36.068 --> 00:39:39.689
Then you explained that she
was bored being a housewife

487
00:39:39.724 --> 00:39:41.758
so we put things
in place for her

488
00:39:41.827 --> 00:39:44.586
to open a fucking business.

489
00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:48.206
All under the guise that you
would be bringing her around

490
00:39:48.241 --> 00:39:51.862
just in time for me to use
the information that I need.

491
00:39:51.896 --> 00:39:53.758
And yet all I've
gotten out of it

492
00:39:53.793 --> 00:39:55.896
is Dupree's poll numbers rising

493
00:39:55.931 --> 00:39:58.172
and her climbing
directly up my ass

494
00:39:58.241 --> 00:39:59.896
in the presidential race.

495
00:39:59.896 --> 00:40:01.137
- My wife. I mean...

496
00:40:01.172 --> 00:40:03.551
- No. you're right.

497
00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:06.448
You were correct. Your wife.

498
00:40:07.793 --> 00:40:09.586
Because clearly.
you've fallen in love.

499
00:40:10.862 --> 00:40:13.655
- With all due respect. Senator.

500
00:40:13.689 --> 00:40:15.965
let's be real here for a moment.

501
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.068
You knew Avant and I
had a thing going on

502
00:40:18.137 --> 00:40:19.931
before any of this.

503
00:40:19.931 --> 00:40:21.931
Which is why you and
the head of your company

504
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.896
elected that I'd be on
top of this assignment.

505
00:40:24.931 --> 00:40:27.000
And the fact that she's
been shot and has amnesia.

506
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:27.724
that's real.

507
00:40:28.862 --> 00:40:31.000
We've just been prolonging it

508
00:40:31.068 --> 00:40:33.689
so that we can wait it out
until the election year.

509
00:40:34.517 --> 00:40:35.827
And that was your call.

510
00:40:35.896 --> 00:40:37.896
- It was. Why?

511
00:40:39.758 --> 00:40:41.758
Because if she stepped
into total recall

512
00:40:41.793 --> 00:40:43.965
she would confront Dupree

513
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.103
and Dupree would
try to kill her.

514
00:40:46.103 --> 00:40:47.793
Again.

515
00:40:47.793 --> 00:40:49.827
And probably get
away with everything.

516
00:40:49.862 --> 00:40:50.793
- And that
wouldn't have been good

517
00:40:50.827 --> 00:40:52.068
for you running for president.

518
00:40:52.068 --> 00:40:53.551
- Exactly.

519
00:40:53.586 --> 00:40:55.724
- But I've done
everything so far

520
00:40:55.793 --> 00:40:56.965
that you've asked me to do.

521
00:40:56.965 --> 00:40:58.758
- Everything except
keeping bandits

522
00:40:58.827 --> 00:41:01.103
from kidnapping your
asset outside a store.

523
00:41:01.137 --> 00:41:02.724
Other than that.
you're doing great.

524
00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:08.068
Now. this election's gonna
be here before you know it.

525
00:41:09.965 --> 00:41:12.172
And you shoulda brought
her around by now. Doctor.

526
00:41:13.862 --> 00:41:16.517
Especially if you expect
me to nominate you

527
00:41:16.551 --> 00:41:18.689
as the head of the Central
Intelligence Agency.

528
00:41:20.137 --> 00:41:21.620
Unless that's changed?

529
00:41:21.655 --> 00:41:22.827
- Nothing's changed. sir.

530
00:41:23.931 --> 00:41:26.793
At the same time. we
both know the process

531
00:41:26.862 --> 00:41:29.827
of removing this medication
can cause severe hallucinations

532
00:41:29.862 --> 00:41:31.793
and even be deadly.

533
00:41:31.862 --> 00:41:33.724
Which is why the
weening takes time.

534
00:41:34.965 --> 00:41:37.206
- You know what takes time?

535
00:41:37.206 --> 00:41:38.896
You dragging this
out takes time.

536
00:41:40.551 --> 00:41:42.034
You should have let her
just have some seizures

537
00:41:42.034 --> 00:41:44.068
or whatever the fuck it
is and get on with it.

538
00:41:45.965 --> 00:41:48.758
Yet here we are with soldier
gone wild on the loose.

539
00:41:48.793 --> 00:41:50.241
Two dead hit men
in the parking lot

540
00:41:50.275 --> 00:41:52.103
and god only knows
who sent them.

541
00:41:52.137 --> 00:41:55.068
And police evidence that
your wife killed them.

542
00:41:56.793 --> 00:41:58.758
Evidence that we now
have to make disappear.

543
00:41:58.793 --> 00:41:59.551
- I've handled that.

544
00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:01.172
- Oh yeah.

545
00:42:01.206 --> 00:42:04.068
Yeah. let's not forget about
the police report you filed.

546
00:42:04.068 --> 00:42:06.689
- Of course. I've gotta
play the concerned husband.

547
00:42:06.689 --> 00:42:07.827
- Okay. let's cut the bullshit.

548
00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:12.551
You're not fooling any
fucking body with that.

549
00:42:12.586 --> 00:42:14.241
You were concerned.

550
00:42:14.275 --> 00:42:15.655
About your wife.

551
00:42:19.793 --> 00:42:20.620
Now.

552
00:42:23.275 --> 00:42:27.137
You have 72 hours to get
her ass back in place

553
00:42:27.137 --> 00:42:29.793
and resume your assignment.

554
00:42:32.896 --> 00:42:35.000
Or I'm gonna eliminate
the whole operation.

555
00:42:37.379 --> 00:42:40.896
And I do mean the
whole operation.

556
00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:55.827
- Going up.

557
00:43:19.103 --> 00:43:22.275
- If I don't leave.
he's going to kill me.

558
00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:23.620
And you too.

559
00:43:24.965 --> 00:43:26.206
- What happened?

560
00:43:26.275 --> 00:43:30.137
- Listen. I have to
tell you something.

561
00:43:30.172 --> 00:43:30.965
- Anything.

562
00:43:33.689 --> 00:43:35.896
- Supreme was apart of
the original hit on Imani.

563
00:43:37.206 --> 00:43:38.931
He got the orders from
the General but...

564
00:43:44.413 --> 00:43:45.241
- But what?

565
00:43:47.689 --> 00:43:48.275
- I did it.

566
00:43:54.206 --> 00:43:55.758
I was desperate for money.

567
00:43:55.793 --> 00:43:57.103
for my mother's medical expenses

568
00:43:57.137 --> 00:44:00.275
and... I just agreed.

569
00:44:02.137 --> 00:44:04.655
And I swear I thought
Imani was dead.

570
00:44:06.344 --> 00:44:07.896
- Why did they want her dead?

571
00:44:07.931 --> 00:44:10.724
- Something about.
she knew too much

572
00:44:10.758 --> 00:44:12.724
and that she was gonna
be bringing everyone down

573
00:44:12.758 --> 00:44:14.034
with the information she had.

574
00:44:15.413 --> 00:44:18.482
Something went down
in Afghanistan.

575
00:44:18.551 --> 00:44:21.758
And the General returned
on operation wipe out.

576
00:44:21.793 --> 00:44:23.896
The entire troops
were knocked off.

577
00:44:23.896 --> 00:44:24.724
- You?

578
00:44:24.724 --> 00:44:26.413
- Hell no!

579
00:44:26.448 --> 00:44:28.896
One body of blood on my hands
was more than enough for me.

580
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.275
- What's General Dupree's
real ties to Supreme?

581
00:44:34.275 --> 00:44:38.344
- She was his father's
overseas connect. then his.

582
00:44:38.379 --> 00:44:40.793
Now he and Jonathan are
going a different direction

583
00:44:40.827 --> 00:44:42.172
with another connect.

584
00:44:42.206 --> 00:44:43.344
- Who?

585
00:44:43.379 --> 00:44:44.793
- I don't know.

586
00:44:44.793 --> 00:44:45.689
- I need you to find that out.

587
00:44:45.724 --> 00:44:46.724
- Why?

588
00:44:48.896 --> 00:44:51.827
We need to get out
of here like we said.

589
00:44:53.206 --> 00:44:56.000
I have access to
Supreme's accounts

590
00:44:56.068 --> 00:44:58.862
and I've transferred more
than enough money into mine.

591
00:44:58.896 --> 00:45:00.068
He won't miss it.

592
00:45:02.551 --> 00:45:06.965
I've packed my bags and as
soon as I leave here. I'm gone.

593
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.310
And I want you to come with me.

594
00:45:11.896 --> 00:45:15.034
But if you decide
that you wanna stay

595
00:45:15.068 --> 00:45:17.827
and remain loyal to
him. I promise you.

596
00:45:17.827 --> 00:45:19.068
he's gonna take you down too.

597
00:45:20.482 --> 00:45:22.413
Especially since he sent
you to bring her back

598
00:45:22.448 --> 00:45:23.517
and you haven't.

599
00:45:23.517 --> 00:45:24.862
- Shh. shh. shh.

600
00:45:26.068 --> 00:45:26.896
Shh.

601
00:45:27.551 --> 00:45:29.137
Let me worry about that.

602
00:46:18.965 --> 00:46:21.206
- Officer. I'm gonna need
you to uncuff this patient.

603
00:46:21.241 --> 00:46:23.000
- I have orders to keep her
restrained at all times.

604
00:46:23.034 --> 00:46:24.517
- Orders and this
patient's health

605
00:46:24.551 --> 00:46:26.310
are not of the same importance.

606
00:46:26.310 --> 00:46:28.448
Okay. she needs a
CT scan of her head.

607
00:46:30.551 --> 00:46:32.413
Anyhow. when I
return I'd appreciate

608
00:46:32.448 --> 00:46:34.206
my patient being
out of these cuffs.

609
00:47:07.517 --> 00:47:08.931
- Faith Newford's room.

610
00:47:08.965 --> 00:47:09.586
- Uh. 450.

611
00:47:12.137 --> 00:47:12.965
- Okay.

612
00:47:17.724 --> 00:47:22.000
All right. anyone in the room.
get them out. immediately.

613
00:47:22.034 --> 00:47:23.137
Standby until I get there.

614
00:47:24.413 --> 00:47:25.241
I need to handle this.

615
00:47:26.586 --> 00:47:29.000
If she escapes.
bring her back to me.

616
00:47:30.068 --> 00:47:30.896
Alive.

617
00:47:46.275 --> 00:47:47.551
- Don't do anything
stupid. okay?

618
00:47:53.586 --> 00:47:55.241
- Oh. fuck!

619
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.310
- What the fuck is
going on here. Newford?

620
00:47:59.344 --> 00:48:01.586
You can't just run up
in here and bark orders.

621
00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:04.206
Your wife is needed for
questioning and you know why.

622
00:48:07.413 --> 00:48:08.241
- Ah. god.

623
00:48:13.413 --> 00:48:15.344
- Now call off your fucking dogs

624
00:48:15.379 --> 00:48:17.206
and get your ass out
of my investigation.

625
00:48:17.275 --> 00:48:18.172
Or this won't end well.

626
00:48:24.206 --> 00:48:26.000
- Hey. Cap.

627
00:48:26.034 --> 00:48:29.551
I have a detective...
Hoffman here.

628
00:48:31.275 --> 00:48:33.034
He doesn't seem to understand
his position. Captain.

629
00:48:35.689 --> 00:48:36.310
Thank you. sir.

630
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.068
He's clear for sure.

631
00:48:42.758 --> 00:48:45.379
- Shit head.

632
00:48:45.413 --> 00:48:46.241
Captain.

633
00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:49.482
Yeah. but...

634
00:48:49.551 --> 00:48:50.379
Okay.

635
00:48:53.586 --> 00:48:54.379
Fuck!

636
00:49:03.310 --> 00:49:04.068
- Ah!

637
00:49:05.413 --> 00:49:06.241
Oh.

638
00:49:08.689 --> 00:49:09.517
Hey!

639
00:49:11.344 --> 00:49:12.103
- Faith.

640
00:49:15.655 --> 00:49:16.620
Wait.

641
00:49:16.655 --> 00:49:18.034
- God damn it.

642
00:50:43.551 --> 00:50:44.344
- Bryce?

643
00:50:45.413 --> 00:50:46.517
- Target secure.

644
00:50:48.275 --> 00:50:49.241
Faith. baby.

645
00:50:51.137 --> 00:50:52.103
I know you're scared.

646
00:50:54.793 --> 00:50:56.103
But I need you to trust me.

647
00:50:58.551 --> 00:51:00.310
I need you to come with me.

648
00:51:00.310 --> 00:51:01.586
I can explain!

649
00:51:48.241 --> 00:51:49.517
- And then she gonna say.

650
00:51:49.586 --> 00:51:51.482
you must be taking
diet baby aspirin.

651
00:51:51.517 --> 00:51:52.551
Because them blue
pills you takin.

652
00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:54.275
ain't doing shit for you.

653
00:51:54.310 --> 00:51:56.275
I mean. she clean cussed me out.

654
00:51:56.275 --> 00:51:58.344
Said she's looking to
settle down with a stallion.

655
00:51:59.344 --> 00:52:00.517
Ha!

656
00:52:00.551 --> 00:52:03.655
I told her. bitch.
you are 72 years old.

657
00:52:03.724 --> 00:52:05.620
The only stallion you'll
be settling down with

658
00:52:05.689 --> 00:52:06.724
is Jesus Christ.

659
00:52:15.379 --> 00:52:16.517
Yeah. sure did!

660
00:52:24.379 --> 00:52:25.172
Yeah. all right. Momma.

661
00:52:25.206 --> 00:52:26.793
I love you too.

662
00:52:26.827 --> 00:52:27.448
All right.

663
00:52:35.379 --> 00:52:36.517
- Alrighty. here we go!

664
00:52:38.655 --> 00:52:39.482
All right.

665
00:52:45.965 --> 00:52:47.413
Alrighty. Ralph.

666
00:52:48.931 --> 00:52:51.103
Are you ready for
your last ride?

667
00:52:54.413 --> 00:52:55.379
All right. here we go.

668
00:52:57.241 --> 00:52:58.448
Vroom. vroom. vroom!

669
00:52:59.793 --> 00:53:00.758
Ah!

670
00:53:02.517 --> 00:53:06.931
Watch out. going
through the door!

671
00:53:06.965 --> 00:53:07.793
Ah.

672
00:53:09.758 --> 00:53:10.586
Ah.

673
00:53:15.965 --> 00:53:16.724
Here we go.

674
00:53:18.379 --> 00:53:19.206
Look out.

675
00:53:54.862 --> 00:53:55.517
Here we go.

676
00:53:56.758 --> 00:53:57.586
Ah.

677
00:54:02.448 --> 00:54:04.000
- Hold it.

678
00:54:04.034 --> 00:54:05.689
- Oh. shit.

679
00:54:05.724 --> 00:54:06.551
They got me.

680
00:54:10.724 --> 00:54:12.896
Listen. listen.

681
00:54:12.931 --> 00:54:13.724
I can explain.

682
00:54:15.586 --> 00:54:19.724
Now. I've been meaning to
file my taxes since '96.

683
00:54:19.724 --> 00:54:21.620
But after what I seen
y'all do to Ron Isley--

684
00:54:21.655 --> 00:54:23.758
- Sir. please step
away from the vehicle.

685
00:54:23.793 --> 00:54:26.448
- No. I. I can't do that. now.

686
00:54:26.482 --> 00:54:29.827
You see. I know exactly
what this is about.

687
00:54:29.862 --> 00:54:32.586
- Sir. I need you to move
away from the vehicle.

688
00:54:34.758 --> 00:54:35.586
Now.

689
00:54:36.931 --> 00:54:37.689
Thank you.

690
00:54:39.310 --> 00:54:40.724
- Shit.

691
00:54:40.758 --> 00:54:43.482
For 32 years I done
bagged and zipped

692
00:54:43.482 --> 00:54:45.448
and bagged and zipped
and bagged some more.

693
00:54:46.793 --> 00:54:48.620
And nobody ever come
behind me to check my work.

694
00:54:48.689 --> 00:54:50.068
It's that new
supervisor of mine.

695
00:54:50.103 --> 00:54:51.482
I know she sent you.

696
00:54:52.517 --> 00:54:53.724
I'm filing a grievance.

697
00:54:53.758 --> 00:54:54.551
Today.

698
00:54:55.586 --> 00:54:57.379
And poor Ralph.

699
00:54:57.379 --> 00:54:59.862
All he did was drop
dead on Wednesday.

700
00:54:59.862 --> 00:55:01.448
And he can't even rest in peace

701
00:55:01.448 --> 00:55:02.517
without the po-po
running up on him.

702
00:55:08.827 --> 00:55:09.655
Shoot.

703
00:55:30.103 --> 00:55:30.965
- Sorry about the
inconvenience. sir.

704
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:31.827
Have a good day.

705
00:55:33.758 --> 00:55:35.034
Sir. sorry.

706
00:55:36.862 --> 00:55:37.758
- What... you?

707
00:55:39.586 --> 00:55:40.448
It's a damn shame.

708
00:55:44.896 --> 00:55:45.827
God damn shame.

709
00:55:47.965 --> 00:55:48.793
God damn shit.

710
00:55:49.965 --> 00:55:51.482
I tell ya. Ralph.

711
00:55:51.482 --> 00:55:53.931
A black man can't catch a break.

712
00:55:54.758 --> 00:55:55.551
- Get out.

713
00:55:58.172 --> 00:56:00.724
- I knew that bag was a
little too bulky for Ralph.

714
00:56:02.482 --> 00:56:04.000
Look. don't shoot now.

715
00:56:04.034 --> 00:56:07.103
Because you won't get no
argument and no ID from me.

716
00:56:07.137 --> 00:56:08.517
- I don't wanna hurt you.

717
00:56:08.551 --> 00:56:09.724
- That makes two of us.

718
00:56:09.724 --> 00:56:11.793
- I'll be needing this hearse.

719
00:56:11.827 --> 00:56:13.931
- Lady. you can
have this hearse.

720
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.068
You can have the keys.
Ralph's old stinkin' ass.

721
00:56:17.137 --> 00:56:18.448
All of it.

722
00:56:18.517 --> 00:56:20.448
You ain't getting no
argument from me. lady.

723
00:56:20.517 --> 00:56:21.689
I ain't seen nothing.

724
00:56:33.586 --> 00:56:34.586
Ha.

725
00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:35.655
- Step away slow.

726
00:56:36.896 --> 00:56:37.724
- Okay.

727
00:56:38.793 --> 00:56:40.793
All right. take it easy.

728
00:57:30.172 --> 00:57:31.275
- Faith!

729
00:57:31.344 --> 00:57:33.448
Oh my god. are you okay?

730
00:57:35.310 --> 00:57:37.689
- I don't know what to do.

731
00:57:39.862 --> 00:57:41.931
I don't know what to do.

732
00:57:41.965 --> 00:57:43.068
I'm trying everything.

733
00:57:43.103 --> 00:57:44.241
I'm...

734
00:57:44.241 --> 00:57:45.551
I'm lost.

735
00:57:47.103 --> 00:57:49.103
My world is falling apart
and I don't know who I am.

736
00:57:49.137 --> 00:57:50.103
I don't know what to do.

737
00:57:50.137 --> 00:57:51.517
- Is it Bryce?

738
00:57:51.586 --> 00:57:52.241
Is it Jada?

739
00:57:54.689 --> 00:57:57.103
Why are you in a
hospital gown and a robe?

740
00:57:57.137 --> 00:57:59.241
- I don't know.

741
00:57:59.241 --> 00:58:01.137
I don't know how I got here.

742
00:58:01.206 --> 00:58:02.793
I don't...

743
00:58:02.862 --> 00:58:03.896
- It's okay. it's okay.

744
00:58:03.931 --> 00:58:05.068
Shh. It's okay.

745
00:58:05.103 --> 00:58:06.827
Let's get you
changed and showered

746
00:58:06.827 --> 00:58:08.344
and something to eat. okay?

747
00:58:08.344 --> 00:58:09.241
Then we'll talk.

748
00:58:31.068 --> 00:58:32.827
Tell me what's going on.

749
00:58:35.827 --> 00:58:36.862
Were you in the hospital?

750
00:58:38.724 --> 00:58:39.896
And why do you have a gun?

751
00:58:42.793 --> 00:58:44.275
- Girl. I feel like
I'm losing my mind.

752
00:58:46.724 --> 00:58:49.206
My entire life as I
know it has been erased.

753
00:58:52.931 --> 00:58:55.241
I go home and there's
random people in my home.

754
00:58:56.827 --> 00:58:57.931
And my baby is gone.

755
00:59:00.172 --> 00:59:03.000
And then I'm at the
hospital and Bryce shows up

756
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.931
and he's a completely
different person.

757
00:59:07.068 --> 00:59:08.241
He pulled a gun on me.

758
00:59:08.275 --> 00:59:09.862
- What?

759
00:59:09.896 --> 00:59:10.965
What do you mean?

760
00:59:11.034 --> 00:59:13.034
- I've been kidnapped.

761
00:59:13.068 --> 00:59:14.103
- What? By who?

762
00:59:14.137 --> 00:59:16.275
- I've been shot at.

763
00:59:16.310 --> 00:59:18.000
- With bullets?

764
00:59:18.068 --> 00:59:20.000
- I've been called Imani Avant.

765
00:59:22.241 --> 00:59:24.620
- Who?

766
00:59:24.655 --> 00:59:25.931
Who is that?

767
00:59:25.931 --> 00:59:27.965
- I don't know.

768
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.793
I don't know. but
whoever she is.

769
00:59:30.827 --> 00:59:32.137
somebody wants the bitch dead.

770
00:59:38.137 --> 00:59:38.862
- Um...

771
00:59:40.724 --> 00:59:43.655
What floor of the hospital
did you say you were on again?

772
00:59:44.862 --> 00:59:45.827
The locked one?

773
00:59:47.931 --> 00:59:48.896
- I'm not crazy.

774
00:59:50.206 --> 00:59:51.896
- I... I didn't say that.

775
00:59:53.275 --> 00:59:54.000
It's just...

776
00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:58.931
What did you say your
husband did again?

777
00:59:58.965 --> 01:00:01.310
What kind of friends
do y'all have?

778
01:00:01.344 --> 01:00:02.896
- He's a doctor.

779
01:00:04.965 --> 01:00:06.931
We don't have friends.

780
01:00:06.931 --> 01:00:07.965
We have a nanny.

781
01:00:09.379 --> 01:00:10.172
And there's you.

782
01:00:17.862 --> 01:00:18.655
Look.

783
01:00:24.896 --> 01:00:26.724
A couple of years ago

784
01:00:26.758 --> 01:00:28.172
I was in a really
serious car accident.

785
01:00:30.758 --> 01:00:32.206
I got amnesia from it.

786
01:00:35.034 --> 01:00:36.413
Bryce has been really good about

787
01:00:36.448 --> 01:00:38.137
filling me in on the
details of my life.

788
01:00:43.724 --> 01:00:44.275
- Girl.

789
01:00:45.931 --> 01:00:48.931
Look. I'm not a cop or nothing

790
01:00:48.931 --> 01:00:52.931
but I do watch
"Investigation ID."

791
01:00:52.931 --> 01:00:54.620
And this sounds like
one of those stories

792
01:00:54.655 --> 01:00:57.068
called A Whole Damn Problem.

793
01:00:57.103 --> 01:01:01.241
And on the last episode. this
man stole his wife's identity

794
01:01:01.275 --> 01:01:02.413
and gave it to the mistress.

795
01:01:02.448 --> 01:01:03.448
- Karena.
- Babe.

796
01:01:03.482 --> 01:01:04.310
- Karena.

797
01:01:05.448 --> 01:01:06.310
This is not that.

798
01:01:11.448 --> 01:01:13.344
- Then why would somebody
call you by another name?

799
01:01:17.448 --> 01:01:18.068
- I don't know.

800
01:01:23.862 --> 01:01:26.724
- Well. let's Google
that name and see.

801
01:01:32.827 --> 01:01:33.413
Imani Avant.

802
01:01:39.379 --> 01:01:43.068
War hero and
heiress to the Avant

803
01:01:43.103 --> 01:01:46.241
Liquor Distribution
Company dynasty.

804
01:01:46.241 --> 01:01:49.724
Dead after
accidentally drowning.

805
01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:54.931
Faith.

806
01:01:56.103 --> 01:01:56.931
Is this you?

807
01:02:04.793 --> 01:02:06.448
- Will you click on that?

808
01:02:11.586 --> 01:02:14.827
- Captain Imani Avant has
been laid to rest today.

809
01:02:14.896 --> 01:02:16.241
The war hero and daughter

810
01:02:16.241 --> 01:02:20.034
of well revered business
man Raymond Avant Senior

811
01:02:20.103 --> 01:02:22.275
drown tragically after returning

812
01:02:22.275 --> 01:02:25.000
from a successful
tour in Afghanistan.

813
01:02:33.137 --> 01:02:37.034
Captain Avant is survived
by her brother Raymond Jr.

814
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.896
As you can see. the
well loved army soldier

815
01:02:43.896 --> 01:02:47.379
was so highly regarded
that four-star general

816
01:02:47.379 --> 01:02:52.068
Michelle Dupree and Secretary
of Defense. Arthur Bridges

817
01:02:53.586 --> 01:02:55.103
were in attendance
at her service.

818
01:03:00.896 --> 01:03:02.137
- Okay. click on her.

819
01:03:09.448 --> 01:03:10.275
Zoom in.

820
01:03:17.379 --> 01:03:18.206
- Yeah.

821
01:03:19.413 --> 01:03:22.206
I'm so glad you came
up here with me.

822
01:03:24.275 --> 01:03:26.931
I so needed a moment
away from the city.

823
01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:30.586
And plus I've been wanting
to get here for awhile.

824
01:03:30.586 --> 01:03:32.344
- Yeah.

825
01:03:32.379 --> 01:03:34.103
Honestly. this
place is beautiful.

826
01:03:37.137 --> 01:03:38.551
You know my brother
really loves you.

827
01:03:40.517 --> 01:03:43.137
I haven't seen him this
happy since our mother died.

828
01:03:44.586 --> 01:03:46.344
- I love him too.

829
01:03:46.379 --> 01:03:49.034
And I would do anything for him.

830
01:03:57.448 --> 01:03:58.068
- Ha!

831
01:04:02.965 --> 01:04:03.551
Sorry.

832
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.482
This wine is really strong.

833
01:04:09.586 --> 01:04:11.172
The wine is strong.

834
01:04:14.379 --> 01:04:17.103
Yeah. I thought the wine
overseas was strong. ha!

835
01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:19.448
This...

836
01:04:25.965 --> 01:04:26.586
- Cheers.

837
01:04:38.482 --> 01:04:39.103
- Wait.

838
01:04:48.206 --> 01:04:49.137
- Um...

839
01:04:51.034 --> 01:04:52.655
Are you sure you're okay?

840
01:04:54.689 --> 01:04:56.241
- What's the date
on that article?

841
01:05:00.034 --> 01:05:02.965
- Uh. the funeral
was only a year ago.

842
01:05:07.310 --> 01:05:08.965
- Bryce said we've
been married 10 years.

843
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:09.965
That can't be me.

844
01:05:15.172 --> 01:05:16.310
Pull up that picture again.

845
01:05:35.482 --> 01:05:36.275
Fuck.

846
01:05:41.241 --> 01:05:42.448
- Yeah.

847
01:05:42.482 --> 01:05:45.275
And that guy. Raymond Jr.

848
01:05:46.379 --> 01:05:48.000
Better known as Supreme.

849
01:05:49.413 --> 01:05:50.965
The one that they're
saying is your...

850
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.344
I mean. her brother.

851
01:05:55.034 --> 01:05:56.586
He owns the Avant
Suite downtown.

852
01:05:58.172 --> 01:06:00.517
It's one of those high
end exclusive clubs

853
01:06:00.551 --> 01:06:02.000
for the rich and famous.

854
01:06:04.379 --> 01:06:08.413
Politicians. A-listers.
that's who goes there.

855
01:06:11.827 --> 01:06:13.482
You know. I've heard

856
01:06:13.517 --> 01:06:16.448
a lot of things about
that Avant family.

857
01:06:18.551 --> 01:06:21.206
Like. powerful.

858
01:06:23.551 --> 01:06:25.310
And dangerous things.

859
01:06:29.068 --> 01:06:30.206
- Dangerous like what?

860
01:06:33.689 --> 01:06:35.206
Karena. run!

861
01:06:35.206 --> 01:06:36.103
- Girl.

862
01:06:36.137 --> 01:06:37.068
- Girl. run!

863
01:06:37.103 --> 01:06:38.379
- Okay. all right.

864
01:06:40.551 --> 01:06:41.379
Ah!

865
01:06:51.137 --> 01:06:52.275
- God damn it!

866
01:07:34.896 --> 01:07:35.724
- Hey!

867
01:07:42.379 --> 01:07:43.206
- Ah!

868
01:07:45.241 --> 01:07:45.827
- Fuck!

869
01:08:02.551 --> 01:08:03.758
- Faith!

870
01:08:03.793 --> 01:08:04.620
Get in!

871
01:08:05.793 --> 01:08:06.724
Get in. girl.

872
01:08:06.758 --> 01:08:07.586
Come on.

873
01:08:10.758 --> 01:08:12.379
Girl. close the door. close
the door. close the door.

874
01:08:14.655 --> 01:08:17.172
People are really
coming after you. faith.

875
01:08:17.241 --> 01:08:17.931
Why?

876
01:08:19.931 --> 01:08:20.862
Has this got something
to do with your family?

877
01:08:20.931 --> 01:08:21.862
- I don't know. Karena.

878
01:08:21.931 --> 01:08:23.275
- Some mafia type shit?

879
01:08:23.275 --> 01:08:24.517
- I don't know!

880
01:08:25.689 --> 01:08:27.310
But I need to find out.

881
01:08:27.344 --> 01:08:29.413
- Right. because you like some

882
01:08:29.482 --> 01:08:31.379
wingnut terminator type bitch.

883
01:08:31.413 --> 01:08:32.931
I mean. you fucked
a handful of men up

884
01:08:32.931 --> 01:08:34.344
with one karate kick.

885
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.482
How you do that?

886
01:08:40.931 --> 01:08:41.862
- Good question.

887
01:08:45.758 --> 01:08:47.448
I need to talk to Bryce.

888
01:08:47.517 --> 01:08:49.586
- Yeah. call him.

889
01:08:50.655 --> 01:08:51.551
Right now.

890
01:08:57.965 --> 01:08:58.793
- Hello?

891
01:09:01.034 --> 01:09:02.310
Hey. baby. is that you?

892
01:09:04.827 --> 01:09:05.862
Where are you?

893
01:09:05.896 --> 01:09:07.379
Come home. please.

894
01:09:08.275 --> 01:09:10.206
You need your medication.

895
01:09:12.344 --> 01:09:12.965
- Bryce.

896
01:09:16.068 --> 01:09:17.551
- Faith.

897
01:09:19.586 --> 01:09:20.896
- We need to talk.

898
01:09:30.896 --> 01:09:31.655
- What'd he say?

899
01:09:33.965 --> 01:09:34.793
- He knows something.

900
01:09:35.965 --> 01:09:36.793
Take me home.

901
01:09:51.379 --> 01:09:52.689
- I don't know. Faith.

902
01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:53.517
Are you sure?

903
01:09:55.379 --> 01:09:57.586
- Whatever is going on. I
can't just leave Jada here.

904
01:09:59.586 --> 01:10:01.655
We'll figure some shit out.

905
01:10:01.724 --> 01:10:04.206
- Well. then I'm
coming with you.

906
01:10:04.275 --> 01:10:07.275
- What I need you to
do is just get your son

907
01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:09.241
and your grandmother
and go somewhere safe.

908
01:10:10.931 --> 01:10:11.482
- I will.

909
01:10:38.931 --> 01:10:41.275
- Let me know if you can
get anymore information.

910
01:10:53.379 --> 01:10:55.206
- What the fuck is going on?

911
01:10:55.275 --> 01:10:56.517
- Faith.

912
01:10:56.551 --> 01:10:58.655
- Why did you have a
gun at the hospital?

913
01:10:58.655 --> 01:11:00.620
- A gun? I was there
to bring you home.

914
01:11:03.482 --> 01:11:04.413
- Don't lie to me.

915
01:11:06.758 --> 01:11:08.655
- Faith. babe.

916
01:11:10.758 --> 01:11:11.689
Give me the gun.

917
01:11:13.793 --> 01:11:15.034
All of this is happening

918
01:11:15.103 --> 01:11:17.793
because you're off
your medications.

919
01:11:17.827 --> 01:11:20.689
I told you this would happen.

920
01:11:21.655 --> 01:11:23.689
All right. the panic attacks.

921
01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:25.793
The violence.

922
01:11:28.551 --> 01:11:29.517
Feeling trapped.

923
01:11:36.551 --> 01:11:39.517
I love you. so much.

924
01:11:40.793 --> 01:11:41.620
Okay?

925
01:11:44.758 --> 01:11:46.586
And I promise we're gonna
get past this but...

926
01:11:48.896 --> 01:11:49.724
You've gotta trust me.

927
01:12:04.724 --> 01:12:07.620
I'm so sorry this
is happening to you.

928
01:12:20.931 --> 01:12:22.103
Come on. let's go to bed.

929
01:12:22.137 --> 01:12:22.965
Come on.

930
01:12:26.827 --> 01:12:27.655
Come on.

931
01:12:45.551 --> 01:12:47.413
Come on babe. let's go.

932
01:13:32.862 --> 01:13:33.896
- I'm disappointed
in you. bitch.

933
01:13:33.896 --> 01:13:35.793
I'm so disappointed in you.

934
01:13:36.862 --> 01:13:37.965
Uh-huh.

935
01:13:39.517 --> 01:13:40.137
Stealing?

936
01:13:42.068 --> 01:13:44.758
Sending a woman to do a man's
job. I can deal with that.

937
01:13:44.827 --> 01:13:46.517
That's my fault.

938
01:13:46.517 --> 01:13:48.000
But ain't no bitch
gonna steal from me.

939
01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:06.413
- Okay.

940
01:14:12.655 --> 01:14:13.862
- I'm sorry.

941
01:14:13.896 --> 01:14:14.965
I've never been like this.

942
01:14:16.137 --> 01:14:16.793
- You only live once.

943
01:14:30.103 --> 01:14:31.000
- Same one?

944
01:14:34.103 --> 01:14:34.931
- No.

945
01:14:38.103 --> 01:14:39.724
This time someone shot me.

946
01:14:41.068 --> 01:14:45.896
- Really?

947
01:14:46.827 --> 01:14:51.551
You wanna talk about it?

948
01:14:52.034 --> 01:14:52.827
- No.

949
01:14:55.551 --> 01:14:57.965
I just want to get
my day started.

950
01:15:01.103 --> 01:15:03.103
- Babe. listen.

951
01:15:03.103 --> 01:15:07.344
I know you don't like
taking them pills. but...

952
01:15:07.379 --> 01:15:08.517
We'll get through this.

953
01:15:14.172 --> 01:15:15.000
- I know.

954
01:15:19.586 --> 01:15:20.931
- Now who's the optimist?

955
01:15:23.586 --> 01:15:24.793
- With a dash of love.

956
01:15:28.689 --> 01:15:29.896
Jada. monster!

957
01:15:30.931 --> 01:15:31.965
It's time to get up.

958
01:15:53.793 --> 01:15:54.551
May I join you?

959
01:16:08.103 --> 01:16:09.931
I'll take that as a yes.

960
01:16:15.241 --> 01:16:16.034
- Mm.

961
01:16:28.137 --> 01:16:29.620
She's back at home now.

962
01:16:29.689 --> 01:16:31.103
Everything's back to normal.

963
01:16:31.137 --> 01:16:33.724
I've got eyes on her
everywhere this time.

964
01:16:33.724 --> 01:16:36.793
In a few days I'll lower the
dosage on her medication.

965
01:16:36.827 --> 01:16:38.896
We should be able to
find the documents then.

966
01:16:39.758 --> 01:16:40.586
- Well done.

967
01:16:43.827 --> 01:16:44.655
Now.

968
01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.103
Who sent those men?

969
01:16:49.448 --> 01:16:50.241
- General Dupree.

970
01:16:52.448 --> 01:16:54.862
But Dupree's men weren't
the only ones to show up.

971
01:16:56.793 --> 01:16:57.620
The brother's men.

972
01:16:59.275 --> 01:17:01.172
- Hm.

973
01:17:01.172 --> 01:17:02.931
- Raymond Supreme Avant Jr.

974
01:17:04.896 --> 01:17:06.068
Daddy's little prince.

975
01:17:07.896 --> 01:17:10.137
Handed life on a
palladium spoon.

976
01:17:10.172 --> 01:17:12.275
My sources tell me it was Dupree

977
01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:14.413
who ordered the brother
to execute his sister.

978
01:17:16.482 --> 01:17:18.827
And that's how she got the
bullet in the back of the head.

979
01:17:21.310 --> 01:17:21.965
- Wow.

980
01:17:25.862 --> 01:17:28.344
It appears as though it's
time to return the favor.

981
01:17:28.379 --> 01:17:29.241
- Absolutely.

982
01:17:37.103 --> 01:17:39.275
- And yet somehow you're
still sitting here with me.

983
01:17:48.241 --> 01:17:49.896
- Good morning. gentlemen.

984
01:17:49.896 --> 01:17:51.862
I appreciate you stopping in.

985
01:17:51.896 --> 01:17:53.931
I'm still a little bit upset
about my sweet Dominique

986
01:17:53.965 --> 01:17:55.931
so forgive me if I'm
not myself. all right?

987
01:17:57.448 --> 01:17:59.379
- Well. I still
can't believe it.

988
01:17:59.379 --> 01:18:00.275
- Me either.

989
01:18:02.379 --> 01:18:04.413
I know you loved her.
she was good to you.

990
01:18:04.448 --> 01:18:06.241
- Too good.

991
01:18:06.275 --> 01:18:08.931
- I don't want you to
worry about it. okay?

992
01:18:08.965 --> 01:18:10.344
I've already put some men on it

993
01:18:10.413 --> 01:18:12.000
and we'll figure
out who did this.

994
01:18:12.068 --> 01:18:13.724
- Yeah. well my
money's on Dupree.

995
01:18:18.586 --> 01:18:20.275
That's okay.

996
01:18:20.310 --> 01:18:21.551
No worries.

997
01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:24.137
Karma is the master
mother fucker. trust.

998
01:18:25.034 --> 01:18:26.137
Ha.

999
01:18:26.172 --> 01:18:27.862
Speaking of Dupree.

1000
01:18:27.896 --> 01:18:30.206
Those men who snatched Imani
before you got there. Khalil.

1001
01:18:30.241 --> 01:18:31.344
- Yeah?

1002
01:18:31.379 --> 01:18:32.827
- Those were the General's men.

1003
01:18:34.862 --> 01:18:37.103
- Are you sure General
Dupree did that?

1004
01:18:37.172 --> 01:18:39.137
- Yeah. that bitch.

1005
01:18:40.517 --> 01:18:41.896
She was actually
the one who gave me

1006
01:18:41.931 --> 01:18:44.551
the intel I gave
you. but obviously

1007
01:18:44.586 --> 01:18:46.724
she ain't trust me enough
to take care of it.

1008
01:18:49.793 --> 01:18:51.000
- She could have got me killed.

1009
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:51.896
- Right.

1010
01:18:53.241 --> 01:18:54.482
That's all right. I got
something for her ass.

1011
01:18:54.551 --> 01:18:55.482
- And what is that?

1012
01:18:57.172 --> 01:18:59.241
- A mark in the cemetery
and a slow walk to hell.

1013
01:19:00.344 --> 01:19:01.827
I just gotta get her there.

1014
01:19:03.103 --> 01:19:05.034
- Well. she does
have the fundraiser

1015
01:19:05.068 --> 01:19:06.103
at the club coming up.

1016
01:19:11.034 --> 01:19:11.862
- Indeed.

1017
01:20:52.413 --> 01:20:53.137
- Oh shit.

1018
01:21:24.137 --> 01:21:24.965
Faith?

1019
01:22:03.448 --> 01:22:05.931
Well. isn't this a
pleasant surprise.

1020
01:22:07.448 --> 01:22:08.275
- Is it?

1021
01:22:13.275 --> 01:22:15.379
Did you forget it's
our anniversary?

1022
01:22:18.310 --> 01:22:19.137
Mm.

1023
01:22:21.275 --> 01:22:22.586
Now who's forgetting?

1024
01:22:27.241 --> 01:22:29.000
- Does it matter now?

1025
01:22:59.689 --> 01:23:01.241
- Slow down. baby.

1026
01:23:02.379 --> 01:23:03.758
Let me do the rest.

1027
01:23:37.724 --> 01:23:38.517
- Faith.

1028
01:23:38.551 --> 01:23:39.379
- Shh.

1029
01:23:42.586 --> 01:23:47.344
Don't say another fucking word.

1030
01:23:50.724 --> 01:23:52.241
Xavier Alexander.

1031
01:23:56.137 --> 01:23:57.241
I wanna know what's going on.

1032
01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:00.482
Don't lie to me.

1033
01:24:02.206 --> 01:24:03.482
Don't try to gaslight me.

1034
01:24:05.137 --> 01:24:06.137
Because I love you.

1035
01:24:08.172 --> 01:24:09.344
But I will fucking kill you.

1036
01:24:12.827 --> 01:24:14.379
I want to know
every single detail.

1037
01:24:18.689 --> 01:24:19.517
- Okay.

1038
01:24:20.689 --> 01:24:21.517
Listen.

1039
01:24:23.517 --> 01:24:25.034
When you got home
from Afghanistan.

1040
01:24:26.241 --> 01:24:27.586
you went to the head

1041
01:24:27.586 --> 01:24:29.206
of the Senate Foreign
Affairs Committee.

1042
01:24:33.172 --> 01:24:36.241
With the promise of returning
with documents and proof.

1043
01:24:38.517 --> 01:24:42.172
- Well. keep up the
good work. Captain.

1044
01:24:42.206 --> 01:24:43.482
- Thank you. sir.

1045
01:24:43.517 --> 01:24:44.344
- Absolutely.

1046
01:24:45.689 --> 01:24:47.862
- Suddenly soldiers

1047
01:24:47.896 --> 01:24:50.206
in your unit were
showing up dead.

1048
01:24:51.827 --> 01:24:53.344
I was put on the case.

1049
01:24:55.931 --> 01:24:58.448
Powell wanted proof of what
went on in Afghanistan.

1050
01:24:59.793 --> 01:25:01.413
I had been assigned
to follow you.

1051
01:25:02.793 --> 01:25:04.620
That night at the
lake. you were there

1052
01:25:04.655 --> 01:25:06.172
with your brother's girlfriend.

1053
01:25:07.655 --> 01:25:10.344
I had to fall back a few
places or blow my cover.

1054
01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:12.827
And I lost you for a moment.

1055
01:25:14.586 --> 01:25:17.517
When I found you.
you were drowning.

1056
01:25:20.862 --> 01:25:22.655
I pulled you out.

1057
01:25:22.655 --> 01:25:24.517
I thought I had
lost you forever.

1058
01:25:26.206 --> 01:25:28.896
Everything that happened after
that was to keep you alive.

1059
01:25:30.310 --> 01:25:31.586
You actually had amnesia.

1060
01:25:32.965 --> 01:25:34.586
But when you started to heal

1061
01:25:34.586 --> 01:25:36.448
and your memories
were flooding back.

1062
01:25:36.482 --> 01:25:37.896
we were in a full operation.

1063
01:25:39.689 --> 01:25:41.620
And I was scared you
would go full metal jacket

1064
01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:43.758
to bring down General
Dupree too soon.

1065
01:25:49.793 --> 01:25:51.379
So I had to create us a life.

1066
01:25:53.379 --> 01:25:54.482
One you would believe.

1067
01:25:56.586 --> 01:25:58.448
Suppress your memories
with medication

1068
01:25:58.517 --> 01:26:00.655
and keep you safe
until the right time.

1069
01:26:19.482 --> 01:26:20.586
- How do I look?

1070
01:26:22.275 --> 01:26:22.689
- You look great.

1071
01:26:28.275 --> 01:26:28.896
A lot better.

1072
01:26:55.344 --> 01:26:57.000
I mean. what did
you want me to do?

1073
01:26:57.034 --> 01:26:58.965
I couldn't just
let them kill you.

1074
01:26:58.965 --> 01:26:59.896
- You killed me.

1075
01:27:01.551 --> 01:27:04.344
Because what the fuck
is a Faith Newford?

1076
01:27:04.413 --> 01:27:05.586
I am Imani Avant.

1077
01:27:07.896 --> 01:27:09.758
What the fuck is
that besides murder?

1078
01:27:13.551 --> 01:27:16.517
And then your dumb ass
couldn't even be creative.

1079
01:27:17.827 --> 01:27:19.724
You named me the
same god damn thing.

1080
01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Did you not know that Faith
and Imani mean the same thing?

1081
01:27:26.034 --> 01:27:27.758
- Of course.

1082
01:27:27.827 --> 01:27:28.758
It's symbolic.

1083
01:27:30.413 --> 01:27:31.344
That's why I picked it.

1084
01:27:35.344 --> 01:27:35.965
Imani.

1085
01:27:39.517 --> 01:27:40.586
You are back now.

1086
01:27:43.482 --> 01:27:44.896
And you know what that means.

1087
01:28:14.413 --> 01:28:15.586
- You make the call?

1088
01:28:15.586 --> 01:28:16.551
- Did exactly as you instructed.

1089
01:28:17.655 --> 01:28:18.965
As soon as she hits her mark.

1090
01:28:20.172 --> 01:28:20.965
it'll be in place.

1091
01:28:22.689 --> 01:28:25.379
- Taking out a
presidential candidate.

1092
01:28:25.413 --> 01:28:26.620
You're a bold mother fucker.

1093
01:28:28.137 --> 01:28:29.517
- I was raised that way.

1094
01:28:33.448 --> 01:28:34.413
- Excuse me. fellas.

1095
01:28:45.068 --> 01:28:46.103
- Got it.

1096
01:28:46.137 --> 01:28:47.793
Everything's a go.

1097
01:28:47.862 --> 01:28:49.689
- Catch her ass right there.

1098
01:28:58.517 --> 01:29:00.551
- Everything okay. Khalil?

1099
01:29:03.034 --> 01:29:03.655
- Mm-hm.

1100
01:29:16.172 --> 01:29:17.551
- You all right. Jabril?

1101
01:29:19.586 --> 01:29:21.137
- Yes sir. I think
we're being followed.

1102
01:29:31.206 --> 01:29:32.103
Coming up on the left.

1103
01:29:41.586 --> 01:29:43.586
- Oh. I think we're okay.

1104
01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:45.551
Think you're just being
a little paranoid.

1105
01:29:45.586 --> 01:29:46.758
- Yeah. I think we're clear.

1106
01:29:48.068 --> 01:29:49.620
- You may be right.

1107
01:29:50.862 --> 01:29:51.793
- Yeah. I'll tell
you what. though.

1108
01:29:51.862 --> 01:29:53.379
These poll numbers are going up.

1109
01:29:54.517 --> 01:29:56.068
I like to see that.

1110
01:29:56.103 --> 01:29:56.827
- Yes. sir.

1111
01:30:04.241 --> 01:30:06.620
- Okay. now what the
hell is this now?

1112
01:30:06.655 --> 01:30:07.931
- Just construction. sir.

1113
01:30:07.931 --> 01:30:09.827
We're just gonna
take this detour.

1114
01:30:09.862 --> 01:30:11.689
It's probably gonna
make us late. though.

1115
01:30:13.827 --> 01:30:15.137
- Ah. it's probably
better. anyway.

1116
01:30:16.517 --> 01:30:18.689
Let her get there first.

1117
01:30:18.724 --> 01:30:20.448
I'm gonna steal some of her
thunder when I get there.

1118
01:30:20.448 --> 01:30:21.103
- Ha!

1119
01:30:29.517 --> 01:30:30.827
- Yo. what the fuck?

1120
01:30:30.896 --> 01:30:31.586
Jabril. what the fuck
are you doing. man?

1121
01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:32.862
- Yo. somebody's following us!

1122
01:30:35.068 --> 01:30:36.068
- Well. go!

1123
01:30:36.103 --> 01:30:37.034
Go. go. go!

1124
01:30:37.068 --> 01:30:38.068
- Just hang on. I got this.

1125
01:30:41.068 --> 01:30:42.758
Oh shit.

1126
01:30:42.793 --> 01:30:44.896
- Who the fuck is this.
Jabril. who is this?

1127
01:30:44.896 --> 01:30:45.827
- I don't know!

1128
01:30:45.896 --> 01:30:47.034
- Shit. he's getting close. man.

1129
01:30:47.103 --> 01:30:48.206
Come on. come on.
You gotta step on it!

1130
01:30:48.206 --> 01:30:49.103
- Shit. here we go.

1131
01:30:54.862 --> 01:30:56.103
- Right. Right.
right. right. right!

1132
01:30:58.965 --> 01:31:02.034
Go around.

1133
01:31:02.068 --> 01:31:04.103
Who the fuck is this?

1134
01:31:06.896 --> 01:31:09.275
Go in the tunnel. Go
in the tunnel. go!

1135
01:31:09.310 --> 01:31:11.551
Tunnel. tunnel. tunnel!

1136
01:31:11.586 --> 01:31:12.344
- Ah.

1137
01:31:12.379 --> 01:31:13.689
Just hang on. I got this.

1138
01:31:18.931 --> 01:31:20.724
- This is fucking Dupree.

1139
01:31:22.689 --> 01:31:24.310
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa!

1140
01:31:26.034 --> 01:31:27.896
What the fuck?

1141
01:31:27.931 --> 01:31:32.206
Go back. go back. go
back. go back. go back!

1142
01:31:32.241 --> 01:31:34.000
Ah!

1143
01:31:38.137 --> 01:31:38.965
Yo.

1144
01:31:40.551 --> 01:31:41.551
- Stay in the car. we got this.

1145
01:31:41.586 --> 01:31:42.689
- Wait. wait. wait.

1146
01:31:42.724 --> 01:31:43.862
- Yo. let's go.

1147
01:31:43.862 --> 01:31:44.758
Stay here. we got this.
- Don't move!

1148
01:31:44.793 --> 01:31:46.000
- No. wait.

1149
01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.068
No. no. wait. wait.
wait! Hold it.

1150
01:31:48.586 --> 01:31:49.931
- Stay in the car!

1151
01:32:04.068 --> 01:32:06.724
- Come on. come on.
Put the gun down.

1152
01:32:06.758 --> 01:32:08.896
What are you gonna
do. shoot a senator?

1153
01:32:08.931 --> 01:32:10.275
Doubtful.

1154
01:32:10.310 --> 01:32:12.137
Just take me to whoever
fucking sent you.

1155
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.862
- We're honored to host
you. Madam General.

1156
01:32:40.862 --> 01:32:42.655
- It is an honor to
be here. Jonathan.

1157
01:32:47.379 --> 01:32:49.724
- General
Dupree. General Dupree!

1158
01:32:49.724 --> 01:32:52.172
- Thank you. thank
you all for coming.

1159
01:32:52.241 --> 01:32:55.034
Remember. spread the word. Vote.

1160
01:32:57.724 --> 01:32:58.551
- Madam General.

1161
01:33:00.172 --> 01:33:01.344
- Thank you. Jonathan.

1162
01:33:01.379 --> 01:33:02.172
- You're welcome.

1163
01:33:03.758 --> 01:33:07.000
- General
Dupree! One more photo!

1164
01:33:38.827 --> 01:33:41.310
- There he is.

1165
01:33:41.310 --> 01:33:42.275
Ha. ha. ha!

1166
01:33:42.344 --> 01:33:43.758
- Congratulations.

1167
01:33:43.793 --> 01:33:45.758
- Thank you. it is
so good to see you.

1168
01:33:45.827 --> 01:33:47.000
How have you been?

1169
01:33:47.034 --> 01:33:48.206
- I've been great.
I've been great.

1170
01:33:48.241 --> 01:33:49.862
- Yes. I hear you've
been traveling.

1171
01:33:49.862 --> 01:33:51.137
- Yes. but you know. I wouldn't
miss this for the world.

1172
01:33:51.206 --> 01:33:52.862
I have to come out
and support anything

1173
01:33:52.896 --> 01:33:54.068
and everything you do.

1174
01:33:54.103 --> 01:33:55.793
- Thank you. thank you.

1175
01:33:55.827 --> 01:33:57.137
It means the world
to me. you know that.

1176
01:33:57.206 --> 01:33:58.206
- Yes. yes.

1177
01:33:58.241 --> 01:33:59.344
I believe you're gonna win.

1178
01:33:59.344 --> 01:34:00.379
- I do too.

1179
01:34:03.827 --> 01:34:05.000
- You're
gonna take it all the way.

1180
01:34:13.827 --> 01:34:15.344
- Thank you. Hello. everyone.

1181
01:34:15.379 --> 01:34:16.793
- Congratulations.

1182
01:34:16.827 --> 01:34:17.724
- Thank you. what
a beautiful table.

1183
01:34:17.758 --> 01:34:19.068
- Anything you need. we're here.

1184
01:34:19.103 --> 01:34:21.862
- Thank you. that's
so good to know.

1185
01:35:29.379 --> 01:35:31.068
- No place like home. huh. sis?

1186
01:35:34.379 --> 01:35:36.413
You look good.

1187
01:35:36.448 --> 01:35:38.827
For somebody who's seen the
light twice. how was it?

1188
01:35:41.827 --> 01:35:42.793
- You tried to kill me.

1189
01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:45.137
- No.

1190
01:35:47.827 --> 01:35:49.103
I sent somebody else to do it.

1191
01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.965
And because I thought you'd
be dead and stay there.

1192
01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.413
I didn't think you'd
get mad about it.

1193
01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:00.896
- How could you?

1194
01:36:02.241 --> 01:36:04.310
Put a hit out on
your own sister?

1195
01:36:05.344 --> 01:36:06.206
- Please.

1196
01:36:06.275 --> 01:36:07.965
Come on. now.

1197
01:36:07.965 --> 01:36:10.379
We have never celebrated
or been attached to that.

1198
01:36:11.275 --> 01:36:13.103
That sibling thing.

1199
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:15.241
You know?

1200
01:36:15.310 --> 01:36:16.655
We just arrived here at
the same fucked up time

1201
01:36:16.655 --> 01:36:18.482
by way of the same
fucked up people.

1202
01:36:18.482 --> 01:36:20.310
You know it and I know it.

1203
01:36:20.344 --> 01:36:21.172
So spare me.

1204
01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:24.172
- Mm.

1205
01:36:24.172 --> 01:36:26.172
You really are
the devil himself.

1206
01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:35.862
Did you kill Daddy?

1207
01:36:38.965 --> 01:36:40.413
He had cancer but
it wasn't terminal.

1208
01:36:43.241 --> 01:36:45.862
- You were off to the Army.

1209
01:36:45.931 --> 01:36:48.000
Trying to save the world.

1210
01:36:49.275 --> 01:36:50.241
You don't know that.

1211
01:36:51.137 --> 01:36:54.241
- I know when I came
back our dad's body was

1212
01:36:54.241 --> 01:36:55.965
reduced to a bag of ashes.

1213
01:36:57.137 --> 01:36:59.137
- That's because our
father didn't want

1214
01:36:59.137 --> 01:37:01.206
people looking down
on him in a casket.

1215
01:37:02.275 --> 01:37:04.310
So me. being the oldest.

1216
01:37:04.344 --> 01:37:06.241
and the only one who
was here with him.

1217
01:37:06.275 --> 01:37:07.344
I followed instructions.

1218
01:37:07.413 --> 01:37:08.379
- You didn't follow shit.

1219
01:37:10.344 --> 01:37:11.620
You never followed anything.

1220
01:37:11.655 --> 01:37:13.586
You expect me to believe that.

1221
01:37:13.586 --> 01:37:14.448
You hated him.

1222
01:37:14.448 --> 01:37:16.103
- Ah. don't deflect.

1223
01:37:18.172 --> 01:37:19.344
I hated you.

1224
01:37:19.379 --> 01:37:21.137
- Oh. because you
were jealous of me?

1225
01:37:22.206 --> 01:37:23.103
Right?

1226
01:37:25.241 --> 01:37:27.413
Because I was more like
Daddy than you would ever be?

1227
01:37:30.344 --> 01:37:32.310
You know what Daddy
and I had in common?

1228
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:35.068
Honor.

1229
01:37:36.241 --> 01:37:37.172
Loyalty.

1230
01:37:38.241 --> 01:37:39.275
Respect.

1231
01:37:41.586 --> 01:37:43.931
You're just a narcissist
who wanted everything.

1232
01:37:45.137 --> 01:37:46.344
And no matter what Daddy did.

1233
01:37:46.413 --> 01:37:48.965
it was never good
enough for you.

1234
01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.137
And you know why that is?

1235
01:37:52.379 --> 01:37:55.517
Because you're just some
little weak ass boy still.

1236
01:37:57.655 --> 01:37:58.586
And we both know that.

1237
01:38:06.344 --> 01:38:07.172
- Cute.

1238
01:38:08.241 --> 01:38:09.413
He ain't never give me shit.

1239
01:38:11.655 --> 01:38:12.482
It was you.

1240
01:38:14.724 --> 01:38:17.310
You were his prized possession.

1241
01:38:20.482 --> 01:38:22.344
- Is that why you put
a bullet in his head?

1242
01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:24.620
- Maybe.

1243
01:38:26.551 --> 01:38:27.206
- Maybe.

1244
01:38:29.482 --> 01:38:31.000
I might put a bullet in yours.

1245
01:38:32.137 --> 01:38:32.965
- Ha.

1246
01:38:36.206 --> 01:38:37.000
Go for it.

1247
01:38:44.413 --> 01:38:45.551
- Fucking bitch!

1248
01:39:26.448 --> 01:39:27.793
- Yeah. huh?

1249
01:39:27.793 --> 01:39:30.275
Where your fucking daddy
at now. mother fucker?

1250
01:39:54.758 --> 01:39:56.448
You ain't got the fucking heart.

1251
01:40:24.862 --> 01:40:25.586
- And I believe your father's
in the military. yes?

1252
01:40:25.655 --> 01:40:26.655
- Yes. yes.

1253
01:40:26.689 --> 01:40:28.034
A two-star general.

1254
01:40:28.068 --> 01:40:29.275
- Meh. I got a
couple stars on him.

1255
01:40:29.344 --> 01:40:30.758
but I won't hold
that against him.

1256
01:40:34.551 --> 01:40:35.379
- Get her out of here!

1257
01:40:35.413 --> 01:40:36.689
Get her out of here!

1258
01:40:36.689 --> 01:40:38.206
- Let's go. move. move.

1259
01:40:38.241 --> 01:40:39.000
- Move.

1260
01:41:42.758 --> 01:41:44.241
- Well. well. well.

1261
01:41:45.758 --> 01:41:47.655
I must admit. it's
good to see you.

1262
01:41:50.172 --> 01:41:52.206
You always were a
persistent little thing.

1263
01:41:55.620 --> 01:41:57.448
Surely. you didn't
come to kill me.

1264
01:41:58.827 --> 01:42:00.137
Did you. soldier?

1265
01:42:04.379 --> 01:42:06.172
Always was your
biggest downfall.

1266
01:42:07.310 --> 01:42:08.620
Trying to outshine the master.

1267
01:42:10.482 --> 01:42:12.137
Didn't Raymond
teach you anything?

1268
01:42:13.344 --> 01:42:14.827
- This isn't about my father.

1269
01:42:17.275 --> 01:42:18.551
This is about me and you.

1270
01:42:23.758 --> 01:42:24.862
- Salam Alaikum.

1271
01:42:24.931 --> 01:42:26.275
- Alaikum salam.

1272
01:42:54.275 --> 01:42:55.586
- Balcony. do you see him?

1273
01:42:55.620 --> 01:42:56.413
- I see him.

1274
01:42:59.275 --> 01:43:01.310
- Hey Cap. we got a lot
of movement up there.

1275
01:43:02.379 --> 01:43:04.310
We need to move. now.

1276
01:43:06.482 --> 01:43:07.482
- We're on the move.

1277
01:43:11.758 --> 01:43:13.448
- I got a phone. 12 o'clock.

1278
01:43:16.862 --> 01:43:18.586
I don't like this.

1279
01:43:18.620 --> 01:43:20.724
- We need to
get the President out now.

1280
01:43:20.724 --> 01:43:21.896
- I think we should--

1281
01:43:36.827 --> 01:43:37.724
- We gotta move!

1282
01:43:39.275 --> 01:43:40.241
Move!

1283
01:44:05.896 --> 01:44:07.758
- Cap. wait.

1284
01:44:07.827 --> 01:44:08.586
Maybe you should--

1285
01:44:08.655 --> 01:44:09.793
- I shouldn't what?

1286
01:44:09.862 --> 01:44:11.517
I shouldn't say
anything to the General

1287
01:44:11.517 --> 01:44:13.655
about how she sent us on a
fucking suicide mission. huh?

1288
01:44:15.034 --> 01:44:15.862
Move. soldier.

1289
01:44:31.482 --> 01:44:32.448
- Mission accomplished?

1290
01:44:32.482 --> 01:44:34.034
- What mission. General Dupree?

1291
01:44:34.103 --> 01:44:35.586
The real one or the fake one?

1292
01:44:49.068 --> 01:44:51.344
That was a drone hit.

1293
01:44:51.379 --> 01:44:53.068
Not suicide bombers. not rebels.

1294
01:44:53.103 --> 01:44:54.517
- Be easy. soldier.

1295
01:44:54.517 --> 01:44:55.620
- I lost three men out there.

1296
01:44:55.689 --> 01:44:57.413
- Stand down.
soldier. last warning.

1297
01:44:57.448 --> 01:44:58.310
- That was a fucking ambush!

1298
01:44:58.379 --> 01:45:00.379
- Everything went as planned.

1299
01:45:00.379 --> 01:45:01.862
- Not the plan relayed to me.

1300
01:45:03.827 --> 01:45:07.862
We were supposed to save
President Zalmai. not kill him.

1301
01:45:07.896 --> 01:45:11.482
And then blame it on some
makeshift. OCI rebels

1302
01:45:11.482 --> 01:45:14.724
who were armed with American
weapons and ammunition

1303
01:45:14.758 --> 01:45:16.931
and then conveniently
named terrorists by you.

1304
01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:18.379
- Now you're in violation.

1305
01:45:18.413 --> 01:45:19.689
I said. stand the fuck down!

1306
01:45:19.689 --> 01:45:22.000
- Oh yeah. well tell
it to fucking Congress.

1307
01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:23.586
Because I already
alerted the head

1308
01:45:23.620 --> 01:45:25.068
of Foreign Affairs
Committee. Senator Powell.

1309
01:45:25.103 --> 01:45:26.965
that this mission
was faulty by design.

1310
01:45:43.586 --> 01:45:44.586
- We have a problem.

1311
01:45:49.689 --> 01:45:51.724
You know. you always
were too self righteous

1312
01:45:51.793 --> 01:45:52.793
for your own good.

1313
01:45:54.172 --> 01:45:56.793
Nobody gives a fuck
about those people.

1314
01:45:56.793 --> 01:45:58.827
The world has painted
them as terrorists

1315
01:45:58.827 --> 01:46:01.724
and just maybe
that's what they are.

1316
01:46:03.655 --> 01:46:05.689
Do you think anyone
cared that we were

1317
01:46:05.724 --> 01:46:08.482
the ones who actually ordered
the hit on their president?

1318
01:46:09.758 --> 01:46:10.758
That would be a hell no.

1319
01:46:10.793 --> 01:46:11.931
And you know why?

1320
01:46:13.827 --> 01:46:15.482
Because the world
has relegated them

1321
01:46:15.517 --> 01:46:17.034
to being throw away people.

1322
01:46:18.172 --> 01:46:19.965
Not even worthy of the land

1323
01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.379
and the rich resources
they sit upon.

1324
01:46:23.896 --> 01:46:25.827
Every time somebody
fills their gas tank

1325
01:46:25.827 --> 01:46:28.000
or heats their
house or buys oil.

1326
01:46:28.034 --> 01:46:29.448
do you think they give a damn

1327
01:46:29.482 --> 01:46:32.137
that we were the ones
who ran over villages

1328
01:46:32.172 --> 01:46:35.413
and started wars and created
faux rescue missions to get it?

1329
01:46:37.034 --> 01:46:38.689
Again. that would be a no.

1330
01:46:38.758 --> 01:46:42.586
And that is because those
people don't matter. Imani.

1331
01:46:42.620 --> 01:46:44.241
And for the life of
me. I can't understand

1332
01:46:44.241 --> 01:46:45.551
why the fuck you think they do.

1333
01:46:45.586 --> 01:46:46.655
- They're people.

1334
01:46:48.655 --> 01:46:49.827
They deserve to live.

1335
01:46:50.965 --> 01:46:51.931
And live well.

1336
01:46:53.758 --> 01:46:55.137
Liberation and democracy.

1337
01:46:56.517 --> 01:46:57.689
That was your mantra.

1338
01:46:59.862 --> 01:47:00.758
Or...

1339
01:47:02.241 --> 01:47:04.275
Does that not matter
to you when it comes

1340
01:47:04.310 --> 01:47:05.482
to black and brown babies?

1341
01:47:05.551 --> 01:47:07.931
- Oh god. here we go.

1342
01:47:07.965 --> 01:47:09.172
The race card.

1343
01:47:09.241 --> 01:47:10.620
I don't make up the
rules. princess.

1344
01:47:10.655 --> 01:47:11.862
I just enforce them.

1345
01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:15.275
And you.

1346
01:47:15.275 --> 01:47:17.586
You've gotta be the biggest
hypocrite of them all.

1347
01:47:19.310 --> 01:47:21.000
I know you don't think
the Avant's wealth

1348
01:47:21.034 --> 01:47:22.793
just came from your
daddy's good looks.

1349
01:47:26.655 --> 01:47:27.931
How many women
and children died?

1350
01:47:29.551 --> 01:47:30.862
How many rebels
were paid to guard

1351
01:47:30.896 --> 01:47:33.724
your daddy's coca and
poppy plantations. huh?

1352
01:47:35.344 --> 01:47:37.034
How many villages
pillaged so you could be

1353
01:47:37.068 --> 01:47:38.206
amongst the 1%?

1354
01:47:39.689 --> 01:47:42.034
Going to your fancy schools.

1355
01:47:42.034 --> 01:47:44.034
Living in your mansions.

1356
01:47:44.034 --> 01:47:45.758
- Don't try to blame
this on my father

1357
01:47:45.793 --> 01:47:48.206
because we both know you were
his partner in all of this.

1358
01:47:49.551 --> 01:47:50.137
- Yes!

1359
01:47:51.275 --> 01:47:53.482
Yes. I was!

1360
01:47:54.310 --> 01:47:55.586
And you wanna know why?

1361
01:47:57.103 --> 01:47:59.000
Because we understood
each other.

1362
01:48:00.620 --> 01:48:02.103
We understood the assignment.

1363
01:48:03.724 --> 01:48:07.310
But you. little miss ungrateful.

1364
01:48:07.379 --> 01:48:09.793
So determined to destroy
everything we built

1365
01:48:09.827 --> 01:48:11.172
and take your own family
down in the process.

1366
01:48:11.172 --> 01:48:12.034
And for what?

1367
01:48:13.137 --> 01:48:14.068
The good of man?

1368
01:48:15.965 --> 01:48:17.586
Oh please. that is such
a pile of bullshit.

1369
01:48:17.620 --> 01:48:18.965
- You should rot in hell.

1370
01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:20.793
- And you should watch
your fucking back.

1371
01:48:22.103 --> 01:48:23.931
Because your borrowed
time is ticking.

1372
01:48:26.241 --> 01:48:28.965
Now move. soldier.

1373
01:48:53.137 --> 01:48:57.896
- Freeze!

1374
01:48:58.724 --> 01:48:58.965
- Mother fucker.

1375
01:49:10.344 --> 01:49:11.206
- I'm okay.

1376
01:49:11.206 --> 01:49:12.000
I promise.

1377
01:49:23.241 --> 01:49:24.034
- Commander.

1378
01:49:25.344 --> 01:49:26.931
- Sergeant Myles Brailey.

1379
01:49:30.758 --> 01:49:31.931
- Look at you.

1380
01:49:32.862 --> 01:49:34.655
Okay. this is different.

1381
01:49:35.689 --> 01:49:36.793
- You like it?

1382
01:49:36.827 --> 01:49:38.172
- So is this your new uniform?

1383
01:49:38.206 --> 01:49:38.965
- I guess so.

1384
01:49:40.137 --> 01:49:41.586
Ha. good to see you.

1385
01:49:41.655 --> 01:49:42.241
- Good to see you. too.

1386
01:49:45.344 --> 01:49:48.000
Looks like it's time to get
that tatted back on. hm?

1387
01:49:49.103 --> 01:49:50.000
- Sergeant Brailey.

1388
01:49:51.758 --> 01:49:54.862
Or should I say. Khalil Dames?

1389
01:49:56.206 --> 01:49:58.862
My brother. thank you.

1390
01:49:58.931 --> 01:50:00.724
We couldn't have got
this done without you.

1391
01:50:03.068 --> 01:50:04.034
And now that you're back.

1392
01:50:06.172 --> 01:50:08.344
we need to figure out
where these documents are.

1393
01:50:10.172 --> 01:50:14.586
- Well. it looks like you
don't have to search very far.

1394
01:50:15.965 --> 01:50:17.310
The documents are
in the pendant.

1395
01:50:25.034 --> 01:50:26.275
- The whole time?

1396
01:50:26.344 --> 01:50:27.862
- The whole time.

1397
01:50:27.896 --> 01:50:29.655
- The documents
are in the pendant.

1398
01:50:29.655 --> 01:50:31.965
- It's in the pendant.

1399
01:50:31.965 --> 01:50:33.724
- You know what we went through?

1400
01:50:33.758 --> 01:50:34.862
- We could have died.

1401
01:51:10.758 --> 01:51:12.827
- Dupree. Dupree. Dupree.

1402
01:51:16.965 --> 01:51:19.379
I usually don't
come to such events.

1403
01:51:19.448 --> 01:51:22.689
But for you. I decided
to make an exception.

1404
01:51:25.137 --> 01:51:27.689
I had such high hopes for us.

1405
01:51:27.724 --> 01:51:29.379
You were so smart.

1406
01:51:29.413 --> 01:51:31.827
And you were definitely on
your way to being president.

1407
01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.034
But you allowed
your own ambitions

1408
01:51:36.068 --> 01:51:38.034
to get ahead of what I
instructed you to do.

1409
01:51:39.241 --> 01:51:41.965
And now. you know
how this works.

1410
01:51:43.379 --> 01:51:47.172
Don't worry. I made all
the proper arrangements.

1411
01:51:47.241 --> 01:51:50.965
And this will be easy and quiet.

1412
01:52:08.344 --> 01:52:09.758
Cyanide gas.

1413
01:52:11.413 --> 01:52:12.206
It'll be quick.

1414
01:52:14.551 --> 01:52:16.724
Painful. but quick.

1415
01:52:18.482 --> 01:52:21.965
You'll feel dizzy.
the room will spin.

1416
01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:23.068
You'll begin to seize.

1417
01:52:24.448 --> 01:52:25.931
Your heart will race.

1418
01:52:25.965 --> 01:52:27.482
Your blood pressure will spike.

1419
01:52:29.551 --> 01:52:32.103
And then it'll all be over.

1420
01:53:16.620 --> 01:53:17.413
Clean this up.

1421
01:53:34.862 --> 01:53:37.137
- Officers Avant.
Brailey. Alexander.

1422
01:53:38.172 --> 01:53:39.103
Job well done.

1423
01:53:40.517 --> 01:53:42.827
This is what happens when
agencies work together.

1424
01:53:42.862 --> 01:53:44.896
The CIA and Army spec ops.

1425
01:53:44.931 --> 01:53:46.827
we're all brothers and
sisters when we're out there.

1426
01:53:46.862 --> 01:53:49.000
Congratulations.

1427
01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.034
Let's not forget
your field team.

1428
01:53:51.068 --> 01:53:52.241
They worked fast and diligently

1429
01:53:52.275 --> 01:53:54.137
when things started to go south.

1430
01:53:54.206 --> 01:53:55.206
Thank you for your service.

1431
01:53:56.586 --> 01:53:58.034
By now you've all heard
that General Dupree

1432
01:53:58.068 --> 01:53:59.862
has committed suicide.

1433
01:53:59.931 --> 01:54:02.344
Not surprising. she took
the coward's way out.

1434
01:54:02.379 --> 01:54:04.482
And while she'll never
face a court of law

1435
01:54:04.482 --> 01:54:08.275
or jury of her peers. I've
received classified intel

1436
01:54:08.275 --> 01:54:09.931
that she orchestrated
the killing

1437
01:54:09.965 --> 01:54:13.000
of President Zalmai to extend
the war in Afghanistan.

1438
01:54:13.034 --> 01:54:13.862
- Why?

1439
01:54:15.206 --> 01:54:15.896
- She was involved
in a operation

1440
01:54:15.931 --> 01:54:17.413
that was allowing tons of heroin

1441
01:54:17.448 --> 01:54:20.206
into our country via
our nation's ports.

1442
01:54:20.206 --> 01:54:21.586
And she was colluding
with the rebels

1443
01:54:21.620 --> 01:54:24.172
of South and West Africa
to build a drug empire.

1444
01:54:25.241 --> 01:54:27.068
When our new
president is elected.

1445
01:54:27.103 --> 01:54:28.344
I'll work with
that administration

1446
01:54:28.413 --> 01:54:30.620
to have the op declassified.

1447
01:54:30.655 --> 01:54:33.206
So Dupree will be disgraced
and go down in history

1448
01:54:33.275 --> 01:54:35.482
as a war criminal.
a drug dealer.

1449
01:54:35.517 --> 01:54:37.965
and a traitor to
the United States.

1450
01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:39.448
And all of you
will be recognized

1451
01:54:39.448 --> 01:54:40.620
for the heroes that you are.

1452
01:54:42.034 --> 01:54:42.862
Carry on.

1453
01:54:58.379 --> 01:55:01.344
- What was that look about?

1454
01:55:01.379 --> 01:55:04.137
- How would Bridges
know about the pipeline?

1455
01:55:04.172 --> 01:55:05.000
- The pendant.

1456
01:55:09.310 --> 01:55:10.620
- I haven't given
it to anyone yet.

1457
01:55:36.551 --> 01:55:37.758
- Confirming.

1458
01:55:37.793 --> 01:55:40.517
Delta-three-nine-nine
charlie-six.

1459
01:55:40.586 --> 01:55:42.172
- Confirmed.

1460
01:55:42.206 --> 01:55:43.241
- New
assignment ready.

1461
01:55:44.448 --> 01:55:45.275
- Go.

1462
01:56:03.068 --> 01:56:04.241
- Well. this is interesting.

1463
01:56:05.620 --> 01:56:07.689
I never thought we'd
be here. you and me.

1464
01:56:10.275 --> 01:56:11.241
- Neither did I.

1465
01:56:13.103 --> 01:56:14.275
- Did you hear about Dupree?

1466
01:56:15.482 --> 01:56:16.379
She didn't do so well.

1467
01:56:19.793 --> 01:56:21.000
- That's typical.

1468
01:56:29.172 --> 01:56:30.344
Doesn't surprise me. though.

1469
01:56:34.206 --> 01:56:35.344
She got ahead of herself.

1470
01:56:38.206 --> 01:56:41.206
- So tell me. how do you
plan on getting out of this?

1471
01:56:44.655 --> 01:56:49.241
- Let's just say. I
have a little faith.

1472
01:56:54.448 --> 01:56:55.310
- Well. she better hurry.
