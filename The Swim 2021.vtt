[ethereal music playing]

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.381
[man]<i> The idea of swimming</i>
<i>across the Pacific Ocean</i>

5
00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:51.750
<i>is very crazy.</i>

6
00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:54.219
But if the mind is strong.
I mean. you can

7
00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:55.621
take the body anywhere.

8
00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:02.661
<i>My attraction for the ocean
is due to the fact that</i>

9
00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:05.864
<i>at the surface. it seems like
it's the same.</i>

10
00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:10.969
<i>But it's... No. it's not.</i>

11
00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:15.974
<i>There's so many layers to it
and the more</i>

12
00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:17.076
<i>I'm in contact with it.</i>

13
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.711
<i>the more I discover myself
through it.</i>

14
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.484
I think this swim for him

15
00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:29.154
<i>is linked to a much deeper
and secret side of him</i>

16
00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.624
<i>where he would transport to
almost another universe.</i>

17
00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:37.996
<i>This is something
deep inside him</i>

18
00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:41.100
<i>that even he struggles
to understand.</i>

19
00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:46.004
The swim is not
a goal by itself.

20
00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.274
<i>It's not just swimming
from point A to point B.</i>

21
00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:55.114
It is a way to test myself.
and to... to find myself.

22
00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:13.232
So. Trinh. did you think
he was a little crazy?

23
00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:14.900
I... That's what I used to think

24
00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:16.001
- at the beginning. but...
- Yeah.

25
00:02:16.035 --> 00:02:19.249
...it's just a part of him
that's wonderful. and

26
00:02:19.273 --> 00:02:21.373
um. not many people can do it.

27
00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:23.208
- [Oprah] Nope.
- [all laughing]

28
00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.047
[Oprah]<i> Seventy-three days</i>
<i>after swimming with sharks.</i>

29
00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:31.250
<i>being stung daily by jellyfish.</i>

30
00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:33.585
<i>and battling 20-foot waves.</i>

31
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.221
<i>Ben arrived in France.</i>

32
00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:38.090
When I did the Atlantic.
I thought it was

33
00:02:38.124 --> 00:02:40.225
that one-time thing

34
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.226
<i>and that was it.</i>

35
00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:42.895
It was very difficult.

36
00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:45.764
All your senses are deprived.

37
00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:47.366
So. day after day.

38
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.503
all that becomes much
more difficult to deal with.

39
00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:53.672
Now I hear you plan
to do the Pacific?

40
00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:54.873
That's correct.

41
00:02:54.908 --> 00:02:56.909
When I arrived.
my first words were.

42
00:02:56.943 --> 00:02:59.411
"Never again."
And few months after.

43
00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:00.946
"No. I need to go back."

44
00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.581
<i>It's something that I need.</i>

45
00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:14.459
- I added a tablespoon of flour.
- Do you wanna rinse that out?

46
00:03:18.598 --> 00:03:19.932
Um. today is my dad's birthday.

47
00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:24.069
- He's turning 51.
- We're making a cake.

48
00:03:24.103 --> 00:03:25.404
Are you guys gonna
start it with him?

49
00:03:25.438 --> 00:03:27.906
Yes. That's the theory.

50
00:03:28.808 --> 00:03:30.709
For however long Max can swim.

51
00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:31.643
[all laughing]

52
00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:34.112
[cameraman] Are you excited
for it to be done?

53
00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:35.280
Yes. I can't wait.

54
00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:38.250
Yeah. it hasn't been easy.

55
00:03:38.284 --> 00:03:41.787
Yes. We haven't had any
vacations for...

56
00:03:41.821 --> 00:03:43.388
the last seven years.

57
00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:47.259
Every year it was. like. "Oh.
it's gonna happen this year."

58
00:03:47.293 --> 00:03:48.560
And the next year.
and the next year.

59
00:03:48.595 --> 00:03:50.295
So. yeah.

60
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.498
So. I'm ready.
I'm ready for him to just

61
00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:55.634
find out what it is.
to find himself

62
00:03:55.668 --> 00:03:56.835
and maybe...

63
00:03:58.104 --> 00:03:59.371
if it works. it's great.

64
00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:01.340
If it doesn't work.
he knows his limits.

65
00:04:07.013 --> 00:04:10.482
Yeah. yeah. That's a long.
long way. right?

66
00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:11.984
It's really far. [laughs]

67
00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:16.021
[Ben]<i> Yeah. it has been</i>
<i>very difficult.</i>

68
00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:18.957
I look at it. what I'm
doing is very selfish.

69
00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:21.994
<i>but I think I stumbled
on to the ocean</i>

70
00:04:22.028 --> 00:04:24.162
<i>as a way to unlock my mind.</i>

71
00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:27.232
A door to part of me that I
cannot find anywhere else.

72
00:04:28.234 --> 00:04:31.803
<i>In some ways. I am fortunate</i>

73
00:04:31.838 --> 00:04:35.607
to have found that.
but it creates a lot of.

74
00:04:35.642 --> 00:04:37.976
uh. difficulty
and challenges for people

75
00:04:38.011 --> 00:04:39.811
that are living around me.

76
00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:44.316
He's mentioned that. "I wish
that this is not a part of me."

77
00:04:47.654 --> 00:04:50.922
I think it's an addiction.
A. um... an obsession.

78
00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:59.064
I'm scared
and I'm worried for him.

79
00:04:59.098 --> 00:05:00.232
[chuckles nervously]

80
00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:01.300
Yeah.

81
00:05:08.908 --> 00:05:10.909
<i>If I could remove that from me.</i>

82
00:05:10.943 --> 00:05:12.411
maybe I would be better off.

83
00:05:12.445 --> 00:05:15.480
But at the same time. it
could be losing a part of me.

84
00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:24.723
In some ways. it's a curse.

85
00:05:24.757 --> 00:05:26.325
[all laughing]

86
00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:30.429
[all cheering and applauding]

87
00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:36.068
[percussive music playing]

88
00:05:54.253 --> 00:05:57.022
It's the last stage
of the preparation. Finally.

89
00:05:57.056 --> 00:05:59.024
<i>Seven years of the boat.</i>

90
00:05:59.058 --> 00:06:00.625
<i>It was very complex
to put in place</i>

91
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.428
<i>because no boat is designed
to last in the ocean.</i>

92
00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:05.297
six to eight months
without any stop.

93
00:06:06.566 --> 00:06:07.966
[man]<i> It only takes two</i>
<i>to three weeks</i>

94
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.801
<i>to cross an ocean. usually.</i>

95
00:06:09.836 --> 00:06:11.937
<i>We're gonna be out at sea
for months.</i>

96
00:06:11.971 --> 00:06:13.138
Okay.

97
00:06:13.172 --> 00:06:14.439
[Yoav speaking]

98
00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:25.484
[Paul]<i> We had to design</i>
<i>all the system</i>

99
00:06:25.518 --> 00:06:27.652
<i>to try and be self-sufficient</i>

100
00:06:27.687 --> 00:06:30.455
because once we leave. there
is no one to help us out there.

101
00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:37.229
[Yoav]<i> We're letting one person
be in the water all the time.</i>

102
00:06:37.296 --> 00:06:39.831
which on other boats.
you refer to as an emergency.

103
00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:40.866
Always a man overboard.

104
00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:44.069
<i>It's not something
you do lightly.</i>

105
00:06:44.103 --> 00:06:45.003
It's a risk.

106
00:06:48.007 --> 00:06:51.410
[Paul]<i> My main responsibility
will be taking care of my uncle.</i>

107
00:06:51.444 --> 00:06:55.180
And. naturally. like.
all my energy goes to it.

108
00:06:55.214 --> 00:06:58.784
Thank you. You guys
look out for each other. okay?

109
00:06:58.818 --> 00:07:02.487
All our lives are in danger
and Ben knows it.

110
00:07:02.522 --> 00:07:04.423
- Be safe. okay?
- Yeah. Thank you very much.

111
00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:08.026
- Okay?
- Yeah.

112
00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:10.529
[horn blowing]

113
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.034
[Ty Dalitz]<i> It's Mother Nature</i>
<i>out there.</i>

114
00:07:16.068 --> 00:07:17.636
<i>Anything can happen.</i>

115
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.038
<i>So. I guess. that's the risk
we have to take.</i>

116
00:07:20.072 --> 00:07:21.706
It's also the adventure. so...

117
00:07:31.417 --> 00:07:35.053
[melancholy piano music playing]

118
00:07:52.205 --> 00:07:54.973
<i>I have many fears
and worries about this trip.</i>

119
00:07:55.007 --> 00:07:58.243
<i>But I want my family
to understand that sometimes</i>

120
00:07:58.277 --> 00:08:00.045
<i>you have risk in life.</i>

121
00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:04.216
but you have to not let
the fear and worries

122
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.318
stop you from
what makes you happy.

123
00:08:10.089 --> 00:08:12.057
<i>When I became a father.</i>

124
00:08:12.091 --> 00:08:15.160
<i>it was very clear
in my mind that</i>

125
00:08:15.194 --> 00:08:17.929
<i>what I could provide to them was</i>

126
00:08:17.964 --> 00:08:21.766
<i>not materialistic things. but</i>

127
00:08:21.801 --> 00:08:25.237
<i>something deeper and something
that is much more important.</i>

128
00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:29.274
You know. finding a passion.
going after your dreams.

129
00:08:29.308 --> 00:08:32.644
<i>I would hope that's what
my kids will get out of it.</i>

130
00:08:38.684 --> 00:08:39.885
- Go ahead.
- Uh...

131
00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.786
You go. Go on. Yeah.

132
00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:45.457

[Ben speaking]

134
00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:09.514
[man] Bye. guys.

135
00:09:30.469 --> 00:09:32.671
- All right. Let's go.
- Let's go.

136
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.114
<i>I have been dreaming.
eating. sleeping</i>

137

<i>the Pacific swim
for so long that</i>

138
00:09:45.551 --> 00:09:49.154
<i>now it comes. now it's reality.</i>

139
00:09:49.188 --> 00:09:51.122
<i>I'm like a tiger in a cage.</i>

140
00:09:51.157 --> 00:09:53.692
And please open the cage
for me to leave.

141
00:09:55.027 --> 00:09:57.529
[Paul]<i> I'm not scared about Ben.</i>

142

<i>Even if he gets eaten
by a shark.</i>

143
00:09:59.865 --> 00:10:02.167
or if we lose him in a storm.

144
00:10:02.201 --> 00:10:05.537
<i>deep inside him. he has this
dream of crossing an ocean.</i>

145
00:10:07.406 --> 00:10:12.177
<i>It would be worse for him
leaving without doing the Pacific</i>

146
00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:14.746
than dying trying.

147
00:10:30.429 --> 00:10:31.696
[Paul] Amazing progress.

148
00:10:31.731 --> 00:10:34.032
Fifteen in only five hours.

149
00:10:34.066 --> 00:10:36.134
[Maks]<i> This is the first day</i>
<i>of many to come.</i>

150
00:10:36.168 --> 00:10:37.936
I'm really happy. [laughs]

151
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:39.704
It should be good. Yes! f

152
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.747
<i>We're about to start.</i>

153
00:10:56.255 --> 00:10:59.591
You just have to adjust the
speed so that Ben follows you.

154
00:11:00.226 --> 00:11:01.760
<i>Speed up. speed down.</i>

155
00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:04.396
<i>It's like a video game.</i> [laughs]

[radio chatter] <i>One. two. one.</i>

157
00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:15.707
Holy shit. 21 miles already.
That's awesome.

158
00:11:15.741 --> 00:11:18.243
I'm 100% convinced
that Ben will make it.

159
00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:21.479
Ben. dolphins!

160
00:11:22.448 --> 00:11:24.082
Oh. it can really move.

161
00:11:24.116 --> 00:11:25.917
Yeah. That's. like. seven.

162
00:11:25.951 --> 00:11:28.553
[Paul]<i> If we just had dolphins
the whole way across the Pacific.</i>

163
00:11:29.321 --> 00:11:30.588
we'd be there in. like. a month.

164
00:11:46.939 --> 00:11:48.740
Ben. Ben. Ben.

165
00:11:57.316 --> 00:11:58.783
- Feel all right?
- Yeah.

166
00:12:08.127 --> 00:12:09.227
Wow. I think that...

167
00:12:10.496 --> 00:12:11.529
Fuck me.

168
00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:14.632
- There's a shark.
- I think it's there. yeah.

169
00:12:14.667 --> 00:12:16.835
Yeah. yeah. The shark. uh...
it's following them.

170
00:12:19.105 --> 00:12:21.506
Seagull to Disco.
Seagull to Disco. Over.

171
00:12:25.111 --> 00:12:26.177
Yeah. that's good.

172
00:12:28.981 --> 00:12:31.683
We just. uh. spotted a shark.

173
00:12:31.717 --> 00:12:35.019
Uh. we think there is a shark
around you. Over.

174
00:12:40.226 --> 00:12:42.527
Seagull to Disco.
Do you receive me?

175
00:12:56.208 --> 00:12:57.475
All right. You ready?

176
00:12:59.645 --> 00:13:01.412
Perfect time to lose connection.

177
00:13:04.683 --> 00:13:06.885
Hey! There is a shark!

178
00:13:12.024 --> 00:13:13.191
There is a shark!

179
00:13:17.196 --> 00:13:18.196
Fuck me.

180
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.732
Ben. Ben. Ben.

181
00:13:20.766 --> 00:13:23.434
There was a massive
big fin just over there.

182
00:13:25.437 --> 00:13:27.739
- Just right there. See it?
- Oh. sh...

183
00:13:34.947 --> 00:13:36.214
What do you wanna do?

184
00:13:42.621 --> 00:13:44.355
Wow. This is crazy.

185
00:13:56.402 --> 00:13:57.702
Wow.

186
00:14:03.475 --> 00:14:04.609
This is so amazing.

187
00:14:18.657 --> 00:14:21.459
Does he want to swim
with the shark or what?

188
00:14:23.128 --> 00:14:25.930
[Ty]<i> If a shark decided</i>
<i>to attack us right now.</i>

189
00:14:25.965 --> 00:14:27.632
<i>we wouldn't have much hope.</i>

190
00:14:27.666 --> 00:14:30.435
I'd just ask very politely
for it not to.

191
00:14:48.988 --> 00:14:52.223
I think it saw the dingy
and me as one part.

192
00:14:52.258 --> 00:14:53.725
<i>But it was amazing</i>

193
00:14:53.759 --> 00:14:56.261
<i>to have that big beast
coming around like that.</i>

194
00:14:56.295 --> 00:14:57.662
<i>the eyes following.</i>

195
00:14:58.264 --> 00:15:00.632
[he mutters]

196
00:15:00.666 --> 00:15:04.302
And then. after it went away.
went back into swimming.

197
00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.289
So. day 35 on the swim.

198
00:15:24.323 --> 00:15:27.492
Yesterday was day 34.

199
00:15:27.526 --> 00:15:33.631
Two little knobs
that you bite on.

200
00:15:33.666 --> 00:15:36.134
So. I've got eight hours
biting the same thing.

201
00:15:36.168 --> 00:15:39.270
Your teeth are sore
and also you start. uh.

202
00:15:39.305 --> 00:15:41.706
developing some blisters
inside your lip.

203
00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.542
For me. I need to be
able to move it.

204
00:15:44.576 --> 00:15:47.845
So. I cut one off
and so that I can

205
00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.682
use different teeth
on the one that is left.

206
00:15:50.716 --> 00:15:52.450
This one is out.

207
00:15:52.484 --> 00:15:54.352
So now. I can have it
on the left. and then

208
00:15:54.386 --> 00:15:56.054
I can rotate it.

209
00:15:56.088 --> 00:15:57.889
And I'm going to bite
on the side.

210
00:15:57.923 --> 00:15:59.157
and then after.
I cannot move it.

211
00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:07.765
[man] Good luck. Ben! Bye-bye.

212
00:16:24.049 --> 00:16:26.584
<i>I cannot wrap my mind
around being in the water</i>

213
00:16:26.618 --> 00:16:29.287
<i>for 5.500 miles. No. I cannot.</i>

214
00:16:33.625 --> 00:16:36.194
<i>What you have to do
is to use your mind</i>

215
00:16:36.228 --> 00:16:40.398
<i>to try to escape
in that environment.</i>

216
00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:44.669
<i>For example. the first hour.
I'm going to start</i>

217
00:16:44.703 --> 00:16:47.472
<i>about reliving the birthday.</i>

218
00:16:52.778 --> 00:16:54.679
<i>Remember who was there</i>

219
00:16:54.713 --> 00:16:56.748
<i>and if I hugged them
or kissed them.</i>

220
00:16:56.782 --> 00:16:59.050
<i>what type of perfume
they were wearing.</i>

221
00:16:59.084 --> 00:17:02.854
<i>Try to remember the feel of
the heat of the sun on my arm</i>

222
00:17:02.888 --> 00:17:05.623
<i>and then. what I hear.
you know. was it loud?</i>

223
00:17:05.657 --> 00:17:09.460
<i>So. as soon as I engage
all my senses.</i>

224
00:17:09.495 --> 00:17:12.797
<i>boom. my mind's going to
disconnect from my body.</i>

225
00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:19.437
<i>I cannot control people.</i>

226
00:17:19.471 --> 00:17:21.105
<i>I cannot control
the environment.</i>

227
00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.940
<i>I cannot control the weather.</i>

228
00:17:22.975 --> 00:17:25.643
<i>The only thing that
I can control is my mind</i>

229
00:17:25.677 --> 00:17:28.379
<i>and how I'm going to react
to a problem.</i>

230
00:17:39.191 --> 00:17:43.961
Today's biggest challenge is
not to melt in the sun.

231
00:17:43.996 --> 00:17:45.396
It's way too hot.

232
00:17:47.199 --> 00:17:49.600
It's almost time for a break.
You wanna have a drink?

233
00:17:49.635 --> 00:17:51.202
Fix your goggles?

234
00:17:59.211 --> 00:18:00.711
He's right here now.

235
00:18:03.949 --> 00:18:06.217
[all laughing]

236
00:18:17.596 --> 00:18:19.263
Not afraid.

237
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.601
Just chilling.

238
00:18:31.543 --> 00:18:32.877
[laughing] It's kind of scary.

239
00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:35.012
Don't peck me.

240
00:18:41.253 --> 00:18:42.887
Don't be shy.

241
00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:45.056
Oh. that's awesome.

242
00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:46.891
- [all laughing]
- Oh. that's so awesome.

243
00:18:46.925 --> 00:18:48.693
I think the albatross.
it's. like.

244
00:18:48.727 --> 00:18:51.028
come along to give him
a little fist bump. to say.

245
00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.498
"Keep going.

246
00:18:53.532 --> 00:18:54.899
We appreciate
all of your hard work."

247
00:18:55.534 --> 00:18:56.834
[albatross chirping]

248
00:19:20.959 --> 00:19:22.260
[Paul speaking]

249
00:19:31.303 --> 00:19:32.904
It's there.

250
00:19:34.973 --> 00:19:37.108
Disco. Disco. this is
Seagull. Seagull.

251
00:19:37.142 --> 00:19:40.778
I saw a lot of debris
floating around the boat.

252
00:19:40.812 --> 00:19:41.979
There is a lot.

253
00:19:42.014 --> 00:19:44.015
[on radio]

254
00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:45.850
Thank you.

255
00:19:47.486 --> 00:19:48.953
[whispers] Oh. yes.

256
00:19:53.158 --> 00:19:55.193
Sorry. Ben. Little thing...

257
00:20:02.401 --> 00:20:05.036
This is the bag
that will collect the sample.

258
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:07.138
The water passes through here.

259
00:20:07.172 --> 00:20:09.440
We collect the micro plastic
and keep it here.

260
00:20:09.474 --> 00:20:11.342
Again. let's do it.

261
00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:18.115
With this net. we collect
the micro plastic

262
00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:19.150
that is in the ocean.

263
00:20:19.184 --> 00:20:21.586
For micro plastic research.

264
00:20:26.858 --> 00:20:30.161
The net again.
Houston. it's swimming!

265
00:20:30.195 --> 00:20:32.430
To cross the Pacific.
that was my dream.

266
00:20:32.464 --> 00:20:36.300
<i>But also. this is
some great opportunity</i>

267
00:20:36.335 --> 00:20:41.472
<i>to understand plastic
floating all around the Pacific.</i>

268
00:20:41.506 --> 00:20:44.742
When we deploy the net. we
need to take the time to half an hour.

269
00:20:44.776 --> 00:20:47.144
- [timer beeps]
- Very important.

270
00:20:59.791 --> 00:21:01.559
[beeping]

271
00:21:04.396 --> 00:21:06.264
- It's too full.
- Ugh!

272
00:21:07.499 --> 00:21:10.434
[Maria] Now we'll see
what is inside it.

273
00:21:10.469 --> 00:21:11.969
- You see this?
- [Maria] Oh. yeah.

274
00:21:19.678 --> 00:21:21.646
[Maria] Yeah. there is
micro plastic.

275
00:21:24.816 --> 00:21:27.885
This is just one sample
from many. many. many

276
00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:29.420
that we will take on this trip.

277
00:21:30.055 --> 00:21:31.822
Now we have 26 pieces.

278
00:21:31.857 --> 00:21:36.460
But we see also a lot of big pieces
of plastic floating around here.

279
00:21:36.495 --> 00:21:37.662
Yeah.

280
00:21:37.696 --> 00:21:41.565
Today we found... We passed
heaps of trash in the water.

281
00:21:44.536 --> 00:21:45.369
Oh. yeah.

282
00:21:46.705 --> 00:21:47.738
Donuts?

283
00:21:50.742 --> 00:21:53.210
So heaps of trash in the water.

284
00:21:53.245 --> 00:21:54.545
Always going past.

285
00:21:59.584 --> 00:22:00.751
All right.

286
00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:05.423
I've never seen so much plastic

287
00:22:05.457 --> 00:22:07.692
since we started the trip.

288
00:22:07.726 --> 00:22:09.060
<i>It was everywhere.</i>

289
00:22:09.094 --> 00:22:11.696
<i>Under a few big pieces.</i>

290
00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:14.532
<i>usually you have a colony
or a school of little fish.</i>

291
00:22:14.566 --> 00:22:16.867
Apparently it's a way for them

292
00:22:16.902 --> 00:22:19.670
to have some type of shelter.

293
00:22:19.705 --> 00:22:23.007
But once we remove
the piece from the ocean.

294
00:22:23.041 --> 00:22:25.076
then they will
come and go under me

295
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:26.811
and stay round me
for a little bit.

296
00:22:28.447 --> 00:22:32.783
<i>And it was mind boggling to
see how much plastic it was.</i>

297
00:22:35.253 --> 00:22:36.654
A lot.

298
00:22:56.074 --> 00:22:57.641
[all exclaim]

299
00:23:22.868 --> 00:23:24.135
How do you feel?

300
00:23:26.638 --> 00:23:27.671
Okay.

301
00:23:27.706 --> 00:23:29.340
- Yeah.
- You want to have any tea or something?

302
00:23:29.374 --> 00:23:31.409
You want some food
or something else?

303
00:23:31.443 --> 00:23:32.543
Yeah.

304
00:23:38.216 --> 00:23:39.216
Okay.

305
00:24:07.512 --> 00:24:09.146
Good luck. man.

306
00:24:09.181 --> 00:24:10.381
Let's roll.

307
00:24:36.675 --> 00:24:38.742
[Ben]<i> My father</i>
<i>taught me how to swim.</i>

308
00:24:39.578 --> 00:24:40.978
<i>I was about five years old.</i>

309
00:24:41.012 --> 00:24:42.613
<i>in the south of France.</i>

310
00:24:44.349 --> 00:24:46.917
<i>I remember him pushing me up</i>

311
00:24:46.952 --> 00:24:49.353
<i>on my belly to make sure
I was going to rise.</i>

312
00:24:49.387 --> 00:24:50.588
<i>over the wave.</i>

313
00:24:51.623 --> 00:24:53.991
<i>And when he passed away.</i>

314
00:24:54.025 --> 00:24:56.894
<i>it was very difficult for me.</i>

315
00:24:58.396 --> 00:25:00.264
[gulls cawing]

316
00:25:00.866 --> 00:25:02.233
<i>Now I'm the father.</i>

317
00:25:02.267 --> 00:25:05.069
<i>I realize I'm not
going to be here forever.</i>

318
00:25:05.103 --> 00:25:07.137
<i>and how I'm going
to live my life.</i>

319
00:25:10.108 --> 00:25:12.243
<i>I have a passion
about the ocean.</i>

320
00:25:12.277 --> 00:25:15.713
<i>and looking at it as an old man</i>

321
00:25:15.747 --> 00:25:18.549
<i>sitting in the chair
and back at his life.</i>

322
00:25:18.583 --> 00:25:20.417
<i>"saying. "So what have
you done in your life?</i>

323
00:25:20.452 --> 00:25:23.587
<i>How did you use your talent
or your passion?</i>

324
00:25:23.622 --> 00:25:24.922
<i>"Did you change anything?"</i>

325
00:25:24.956 --> 00:25:27.291
<i>And I don't want
to miss that. Yeah.</i>

326
00:25:28.927 --> 00:25:31.829
<i>Wouldn't be a better life.</i>

327
00:25:46.778 --> 00:25:48.979
But he knows that
he is doing good. though.

328
00:26:01.393 --> 00:26:04.728
Welcome to one of the most
amazing places of the boat.

329
00:26:04.763 --> 00:26:08.365
the jungle. the cabin
I share with Ben.

330
00:26:09.701 --> 00:26:11.835
Why is it called the jungle?

331
00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:15.005
It's humid
and it smells like a jungle.

332
00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:18.542
I've got this bunk.
it's a bit too short.

333
00:26:18.577 --> 00:26:20.010
I used to fall out of my bed.

334
00:26:20.045 --> 00:26:22.179
That's why
I make this rope here.

335
00:26:22.213 --> 00:26:24.114
Most of the time when
it's dark. you can't see.

336
00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:25.883
I put one foot next to Maria.

337
00:26:25.917 --> 00:26:28.886
Actually. it's always. like. um.

338
00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.988
"It doesn't matter
if she's sleeping."

339
00:26:31.756 --> 00:26:33.157
And that's how I sleep.

340
00:26:33.191 --> 00:26:35.159
Pretty comfortable. I guess.

341
00:26:35.193 --> 00:26:38.362
It's probably the best room
on the boat. let's be honest.

342
00:26:38.396 --> 00:26:42.366
Except that Maks
is really smelly.

343
00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.268
and Maria snores.

344
00:26:44.302 --> 00:26:45.703
- Shut up!
- You do.

345
00:26:45.737 --> 00:26:47.137
No.

346
00:26:47.172 --> 00:26:50.107
I have pictures of my family.

347
00:26:50.141 --> 00:26:53.010
so when I need to go back home.

348
00:26:53.044 --> 00:26:57.615
I open this box. that brings
me back the nice memories.

349
00:26:57.649 --> 00:27:01.085
<i>Yeah. Ben took care of me.
when I was a child.</i>

350
00:27:01.119 --> 00:27:03.420
<i>He was a godfather.</i>

351
00:27:03.455 --> 00:27:07.091
<i>I really don't feel like
I'm an individual.</i>

352
00:27:07.726 --> 00:27:09.560
I feel like I'm just...

353
00:27:12.163 --> 00:27:14.832
I'm just an energy pushing Ben.

354
00:27:16.735 --> 00:27:20.804
And I have no doubt
that I'm meant to be here.

355
00:27:35.553 --> 00:27:37.621
[heavy breathing]

356
00:27:42.761 --> 00:27:43.594
Get up.

357
00:27:44.396 --> 00:27:45.929
Time to wake up. mate.

358
00:27:45.964 --> 00:27:48.799
The weather system.
it's gotten worse.

359
00:27:53.972 --> 00:27:55.939
So we had a pretty rough night.

360
00:27:55.974 --> 00:27:58.742
Thirty. thirty-five knot winds

361
00:27:58.777 --> 00:28:00.944
and we didn't sleep that much.

362
00:28:00.979 --> 00:28:03.147
Then we were caught by...
[makes crashing sound]

363
00:28:03.181 --> 00:28:04.682
...waves suddenly everywhere.

364
00:28:04.716 --> 00:28:06.984
I think Ben
didn't have a good sleep

365
00:28:07.018 --> 00:28:08.686
last night
because of the weather.

366
00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.587
[Ty] Plus you were
seasick yesterday.

367
00:28:10.622 --> 00:28:13.123
[Paul] Yes. he gave all
his protein back to the fish.

368
00:28:13.892 --> 00:28:16.760
We just received a report

369
00:28:16.795 --> 00:28:19.463
from the weather company.

370
00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:28.338
They are saying there is
a big system coming at us.

371
00:28:31.609 --> 00:28:32.776
Sucks.

372
00:28:32.811 --> 00:28:35.846
The gods of the ocean are
not with us for now.

373
00:28:39.517 --> 00:28:41.085
[Ty] The storm that
they were tracking

374
00:28:41.119 --> 00:28:43.120
stretches all the way south.

375
00:28:43.154 --> 00:28:45.222
and all the way
pretty much up to Russia.

376
00:28:46.024 --> 00:28:48.092
Eighteen knots of wind.

377
00:28:48.126 --> 00:28:49.860
and that's us just next to it.

378
00:28:49.894 --> 00:28:52.696
That's the kind of storm
that throw boats in the air.

379
00:28:53.565 --> 00:28:54.765
Scary.

380
00:28:54.833 --> 00:28:57.901
We have the position of where
Ben stopped yesterday.

381
00:28:57.936 --> 00:29:00.337
So we know where to come back.

382
00:29:03.908 --> 00:29:06.744
Hopefully in no more
than three to five days

383
00:29:06.778 --> 00:29:08.045
we can head back out.

384
00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:34.171
I hate being on land.
I really do.

385
00:29:35.507 --> 00:29:38.075
The time of the year is now
that there's just.

386
00:29:38.109 --> 00:29:41.178
like. a conveyor belt
of typhoons coming up for us.

387
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:48.018
[Ben]<i> Having to wait now</i>
<i>back on land.</i>

388
00:29:48.052 --> 00:29:50.988
<i>means that it will be
later in the season.</i>

389
00:29:51.022 --> 00:29:54.191
And later in the season
means water being colder

390
00:29:54.225 --> 00:29:56.727
and also having more storms

391
00:29:56.761 --> 00:30:00.297
<i>and stronger storms as
we get closer to the US.</i>

392
00:30:06.371 --> 00:30:10.174
Now we have three
new guys on<i> The Swim.</i>

393
00:30:10.208 --> 00:30:12.409
So. hello. I'm Paul.

394
00:30:12.443 --> 00:30:15.012
Um. first.
updates on the weather.

395
00:30:15.046 --> 00:30:18.749
The idea is to wait and see
what this system look like.

396
00:30:18.783 --> 00:30:21.051
And you can see
that Ben is very happy

397
00:30:21.085 --> 00:30:22.085
with this situation.

398
00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.420
[laughter]

399
00:30:23.454 --> 00:30:24.788
That's my happy face.

400
00:30:35.733 --> 00:30:38.068
<i>Hello and thank you for calling
Weather Routing Incorporated.</i>

401
00:30:38.102 --> 00:30:40.304
Please press...

402
00:30:40.338 --> 00:30:42.573
Departure is scheduled
tomorrow afternoon

403
00:30:42.607 --> 00:30:45.676
and I just received
an email from WRI

404
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:48.078
saying. "Don't go tomorrow."

405
00:30:48.112 --> 00:30:50.714
[woman]<i> Weather Routing.</i>
<i>How can I help you today?</i>

406
00:30:50.748 --> 00:30:53.817
Uh. so. we would like
to talk about the forecast

407
00:30:53.852 --> 00:30:56.186
that we received from you.

408
00:30:56.221 --> 00:30:58.922
<i>Okay. Uh. they do have a concern</i>

409
00:30:58.957 --> 00:31:04.561
<i>it could reach potentially a tropical
storm or potentially typhoon status</i>

410
00:31:04.596 --> 00:31:07.631
<i>round around the time the
vessel would be in that vicinity.</i>

411
00:31:07.665 --> 00:31:09.066
<i>At this point.
I would not recommend</i>

412
00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:11.435
<i>heading out
or even trying to get east.</i>

413
00:31:16.107 --> 00:31:20.544
What if we get out tomorrow
and keep monitoring the system?

414
00:31:20.578 --> 00:31:24.281
<i>Some other systems
will stay off to the south.</i>

415
00:31:26.584 --> 00:31:30.487
We are very inclined
to go out and try our luck.

416
00:31:32.957 --> 00:31:36.360
<i>Okay. um. I'm very hesitant</i>

417
00:31:36.427 --> 00:31:42.032
<i>at this point to definitely
say to depart.</i>

418
00:31:42.066 --> 00:31:44.067
<i>Really not much time to be
able to get out of way</i>

419
00:31:44.102 --> 00:31:46.436
<i>if the system
does accelerate too much.</i>

420
00:31:46.471 --> 00:31:48.805
<i>But to be quite honest.
this is very routine.</i>

421
00:31:49.774 --> 00:31:51.008
Awesome.

422
00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.915
[wind howling]

423
00:32:16.301 --> 00:32:17.701
Ready for a swim?

424
00:32:20.004 --> 00:32:22.539
[Ben]<i> The animal was not happy</i>
<i>out of the water.</i>

425
00:32:23.875 --> 00:32:25.242
All right.

426
00:32:31.816 --> 00:32:33.317
Ooh. yay!

427
00:32:34.085 --> 00:32:35.218
- There it is.
- [clapping]

428
00:32:36.387 --> 00:32:37.254
Back in the water.

429
00:32:44.829 --> 00:32:46.730
- Oh. yeah.
- [laughs]

430
00:32:48.566 --> 00:32:50.400
[Ty] Back where he belongs.

431
00:32:56.708 --> 00:32:59.343
That's so good. So happy.

432
00:33:00.745 --> 00:33:01.912
[bird squawking]

433
00:33:11.756 --> 00:33:15.392
It's like we are all plugged
to Ben's swim.

434
00:33:15.426 --> 00:33:19.229
and we need Ben to swim
to feed our own energy.

435
00:33:19.263 --> 00:33:21.865
Once Ben is in the water
and starts swimming.

436
00:33:21.933 --> 00:33:24.234
it's like a magic
happening on the boat.

437
00:33:24.268 --> 00:33:26.236
Everyone is happy.

438
00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:27.871
There it is. there it is.

439
00:33:27.905 --> 00:33:28.972
Hey!

440
00:33:29.607 --> 00:33:31.608
[whooping]

441
00:33:31.642 --> 00:33:36.079
And the new people
James. Bryan and Gonzalo.

442
00:33:36.114 --> 00:33:37.581
getting used to the boat.

443
00:33:38.383 --> 00:33:40.417
New cameraman not just here

444
00:33:40.451 --> 00:33:42.619
- to. uh. film.
- Yeah.

445
00:33:42.653 --> 00:33:43.854
Gotta sail the boat sometimes.

446
00:33:43.888 --> 00:33:45.222
Reef one. reef two.

447
00:33:45.256 --> 00:33:46.523
- I got those terms.
- He knows it.

448
00:33:46.557 --> 00:33:47.391
Yeah.

449
00:33:48.826 --> 00:33:50.594
Ooh!

450
00:33:50.628 --> 00:33:53.063
Normally you don't have
a chance like right now

451
00:33:53.097 --> 00:33:54.431
to jump in the water.

452
00:33:54.465 --> 00:33:56.266
Too nice. man. Too nice.

453
00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:57.367
No sharks. right?

454
00:33:58.903 --> 00:34:01.671
- I told you about the time we did see a shark. though.
- That's nice.

455
00:34:01.706 --> 00:34:02.939
Yeah?

456
00:34:02.974 --> 00:34:05.308
Had a massive shark come
around us and the boat.

457
00:34:05.343 --> 00:34:07.077
Don't say that.
I don't wanna know that.

458
00:34:07.111 --> 00:34:08.779
We're gonna need a bigger boat.

459
00:34:21.826 --> 00:34:23.527
Sunset is here.

460
00:34:23.561 --> 00:34:26.563
And Ben just stopped swimming.

461
00:34:27.799 --> 00:34:28.632
Oh! Oh!

462
00:34:31.002 --> 00:34:32.502
[both] Oh!

463
00:34:33.504 --> 00:34:34.671
Whoa.

464
00:34:34.705 --> 00:34:36.173
- [both laugh]
- So awesome.

465
00:34:40.611 --> 00:34:44.081
I did. uh. five hours
and about 15 miles.

466
00:34:44.115 --> 00:34:47.484
So it's just a slow restart.

467
00:34:47.518 --> 00:34:50.520
I think it's better that he
does it slowly and sustainable.

468
00:34:50.555 --> 00:34:52.589
We must preserve
his body as much as we can.

469
00:34:52.623 --> 00:34:54.224
'Cause it will be tested.

470
00:34:55.293 --> 00:34:56.793
Good day. Very good day.

471
00:34:56.828 --> 00:34:58.395
[winch winding]

472
00:34:59.163 --> 00:35:01.131
I just hope tomorrow.

473
00:35:01.165 --> 00:35:03.300
when we wake up.
we won't find an email

474
00:35:03.334 --> 00:35:05.635
saying. "Typhoon!
Go back to Japan."

475
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:07.003
Please. no.

476
00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:26.156
Today's
a very good day. I'm thinking.

477
00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:27.591
with the trash we collected.

478
00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.427
Big variety of trash.

479
00:35:30.461 --> 00:35:32.729
We've got some ketchup.

480
00:35:32.763 --> 00:35:34.197
some Styrofoam.

481
00:35:34.232 --> 00:35:37.567
a straw. and the remains
of a plastic cup.

482
00:35:56.454 --> 00:35:57.287
[squawking]

483
00:36:00.291 --> 00:36:01.591
Hi.

484
00:36:01.626 --> 00:36:04.995
- Look at that.
- It's crazy.

485
00:36:05.029 --> 00:36:07.631
- To see a beautiful bird.
- So cool.

486
00:36:10.601 --> 00:36:11.968
You know what type
of a bird is that?

487
00:36:12.003 --> 00:36:13.904
It's a gannet or a booby.

488
00:36:13.938 --> 00:36:15.238
He's the captain. you know.

489
00:36:15.273 --> 00:36:18.408
He looks like the captain
of this garbage boat.

490
00:36:30.087 --> 00:36:31.821
Phosphoric acid solution.

491
00:36:35.826 --> 00:36:37.627
More than 900 miles offshore

492
00:36:37.662 --> 00:36:39.796
and we still find this
sort of stuff in the ocean.

493
00:36:40.598 --> 00:36:41.932
That's scary.

494
00:37:23.641 --> 00:37:25.141
- Look at that.
- Oh!

495
00:37:25.176 --> 00:37:27.277
- [fish grunting]
- Wow.

496
00:37:27.311 --> 00:37:29.479
I was in the water just
cooling down in a break.

497
00:37:29.513 --> 00:37:31.514
And then I heard...
[makes whooshing sound]

498
00:37:31.549 --> 00:37:33.049
Like. behind us.

499
00:37:33.084 --> 00:37:34.618
As soon as Maks heard.
"Oh. it wasn't a shark."

500
00:37:34.652 --> 00:37:36.353
he was. like. "Okay." Boing!

501
00:37:37.822 --> 00:37:39.389
- Wow.
- That's amazing. guys.

502
00:37:44.528 --> 00:37:46.496
[Maks] It's a big ocean
and suddenly you have

503
00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:48.064
massive creatures
playing with you

504
00:37:48.099 --> 00:37:50.367
and looking and. like. trying
to see what we're doing.

505
00:37:51.636 --> 00:37:53.536
[Ty] They're trying
to talk to you.

506
00:37:54.505 --> 00:37:56.373
Ben dived down under the water.

507
00:37:56.407 --> 00:37:58.174
and they were just
swimming together. like.

508
00:37:58.809 --> 00:38:00.710
[fish whistling]

509
00:38:07.752 --> 00:38:09.653
[Ty] They just were
cruising past.

510
00:38:09.687 --> 00:38:12.088
had a look. "Oh. yeah.
you guys are boring."

511
00:38:12.123 --> 00:38:13.556
And then left. [chuckles]

512
00:38:13.591 --> 00:38:14.658
Yes!

513
00:38:14.992 --> 00:38:16.393
Yes!

514
00:38:16.427 --> 00:38:17.861
Fuck. yeah.

515
00:38:17.895 --> 00:38:18.995
Totally cool.

516
00:38:19.764 --> 00:38:21.197
Yeah. man.

517
00:38:21.232 --> 00:38:22.632
That was magic.

518
00:38:30.541 --> 00:38:32.375
Wow!

519
00:38:34.612 --> 00:38:36.746
We woke up with a beautiful
sight. double rainbow.

520
00:38:39.984 --> 00:38:42.585
It's there because conditions
are a little bit rough.

521
00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:43.753

we're gonna stop the swim.

and the only way we could
get it is by being parachuted.

So I jumped out of a plane

606

I don't have a parachute on."

00:50:56.953 --> 00:50:58.587
[thunder crashes]

698
00:51:09.032 --> 00:51:09.832
[shouts]

699
00:51:11.334 --> 00:51:12.802
[laughing]

700
00:51:19.342 --> 00:51:20.509
It's cold.

701
00:51:22.979 --> 00:51:24.480
[shouting and laughing]

702
00:51:32.689 --> 00:51:34.356
[thunder crashes]

703
00:51:53.176 --> 00:51:55.678
His body is changing

704
00:51:55.712 --> 00:51:58.848
and he lost three percent
of his body fat.

705
00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:14.763
Yeah.

706
00:52:18.401 --> 00:52:22.905
It's amazing how fragile
material becomes

707
00:52:22.939 --> 00:52:25.374
after being in the sun
for so long.

708
00:52:34.084 --> 00:52:36.852
It happens after a while

709
00:52:36.887 --> 00:52:38.621
of a lot of stress to the sails.

710
00:52:44.194 --> 00:52:46.896
So this is holding
a very important part.

711
00:53:02.112 --> 00:53:02.945
One hour.

712
00:53:07.017 --> 00:53:10.152
Just keep swimming.
Just keep swimming.

713
00:53:10.187 --> 00:53:12.054
I don't think I can even
comprehend.

714
00:53:12.088 --> 00:53:15.391
He's been thinking
about this for 20 years.

715
00:53:15.425 --> 00:53:18.227
I've never had an idea
that lasts more than one year

716
00:53:18.261 --> 00:53:22.464
and he's been having this
in mind. this dream.

717
00:53:22.499 --> 00:53:24.033
for 20 years.

718
00:53:24.067 --> 00:53:26.569
But his mind.
I think it's unbreakable

719
00:53:26.603 --> 00:53:29.271
and that's never gonna break.
He's gonna keep going

720
00:53:29.306 --> 00:53:30.906
until his body breaks.

721
00:53:30.941 --> 00:53:33.309
the boat breaks
or the weather stops him.

722
00:55:10.273 --> 00:55:12.141
[woman] Ben. Ben. Ben. Ben. Ben!

723
00:55:40.236 --> 00:55:41.837
- [man 1] Maks. Ben is here.
- [Maks] Yeah.

724
00:55:41.871 --> 00:55:44.273
Yeah. Hey. man. Sit down. man.

725
00:55:47.811 --> 00:55:48.911
You hit the propeller?

726
00:55:49.245 --> 00:55:50.079
Yeah.

727
00:55:50.814 --> 00:55:52.414
Let's get you in. get you warm.

728
00:55:59.956 --> 00:56:01.523
[Maks] Can you open your eyes?

729
00:56:04.327 --> 00:56:05.794
- [Maks] You see me good?
- Yeah.

730
00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:06.995
Can you feel my finger?

731
00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:14.603
No. It's okay.

732
00:56:16.706 --> 00:56:18.340
<i>We couldn't see anything.</i>

733
00:56:18.375 --> 00:56:20.676
So I was picturing
behind his cap.

734
00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:22.544
an open wound with the brain.

735
00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:25.714
[Maks] No stitching for now.

736
00:56:27.117 --> 00:56:29.184
It's okay. Maria. Thank you.

737
00:56:38.328 --> 00:56:39.561
I didn't control it well.

738
00:56:39.596 --> 00:56:42.865
That's okay. Ben didn't
lose conscious or anything?

739
00:56:42.899 --> 00:56:43.799
No. No.

740
00:56:47.437 --> 00:56:48.871
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

741
00:56:55.512 --> 00:56:56.745
Can be worse. you know.
if the reaction

742
00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:59.248
puts the hand right in the face.

743
00:56:59.282 --> 00:57:01.683
- A lucky man.
- Very lucky man.

744
00:57:14.531 --> 00:57:17.933
Tomorrow. Ben. what do
you think about the day off?

745
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:21.703
Day off?

746
00:57:23.206 --> 00:57:25.040
Ben. you know you can have rest.

747
00:57:25.074 --> 00:57:27.543
I know the weather will come
and I will have my days.

748
00:58:14.991 --> 00:58:16.225
[exhales]

749
00:58:16.259 --> 00:58:17.626
Really insane. man.

750
00:58:19.762 --> 00:58:21.296
More trash. unfortunately.

751
00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:29.238
Hello. from the middle
of the Pacific.

752
00:58:29.806 --> 00:58:31.440
- With Gonzo.
- Hello.

753
00:58:31.474 --> 00:58:32.808
Yo-yo-yo. What is that?

754
00:58:34.978 --> 00:58:36.345
Oh. It's foam.

755
00:59:01.371 --> 00:59:06.642
Every five minutes finding
a piece of plastic debris.

756
00:59:12.916 --> 00:59:13.749
Wow.

757
00:59:16.486 --> 00:59:18.921
There is a lot in this area.

758
00:59:20.089 --> 00:59:22.724
I already found 117

759
00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:25.761
and there is still more to find.

760
00:59:33.736 --> 00:59:36.371
Oh. what's that over there?

761
00:59:36.406 --> 00:59:38.707
That's not food.
No. no. you can't have that.

762
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:43.345
Just found this little box
here of something

763
00:59:44.013 --> 00:59:45.847
and that'll end up being food.

764
00:59:45.882 --> 00:59:48.283
And they'll take it
back to their nest

765
00:59:48.318 --> 00:59:51.320
and then their hatchlings
will probably die

766
00:59:51.354 --> 00:59:52.721
because of all the plastic
they've eaten.

767
01:00:27.924 --> 01:00:29.625
- [man] Pieces of twine.
- [woman] Yeah.

768
01:00:29.659 --> 01:00:31.393
Plastic bag.

769
01:00:31.427 --> 01:00:33.462
[woman] How
it's. like. degrading.

770
01:00:33.496 --> 01:00:35.130
[man] It's gonna get eaten away.

771
01:00:35.164 --> 01:00:37.332
creating little tiny.
tiny microbes.

772
01:00:38.167 --> 01:00:39.868
Two hundred and fifty pieces.

773
01:00:39.902 --> 01:00:42.504
What was the last record?
84? 85?

774
01:00:42.538 --> 01:00:44.473
- Yeah.
- Almost tripled.

775
01:00:45.842 --> 01:00:47.242
Down here it's wild.

776
01:00:50.546 --> 01:00:53.315
Wow. man. It's so nasty.

777
01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:56.284
The worst place
I think in the whole trip.

778
01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:58.053
I think I have
plastic everywhere.

779
01:00:58.087 --> 01:01:00.155
I have plastic in my pants.

780
01:01:00.189 --> 01:01:02.157
It's full of plastic. Just full.

781
01:01:10.266 --> 01:01:11.800
Yeah. It's fucking horrible.

782
01:01:13.736 --> 01:01:15.404
You don't even have
to look for it.

783
01:01:15.438 --> 01:01:17.072
You just put your hand
in the water and you have

784
01:01:18.307 --> 01:01:20.876
dozens of trash
just in your hand.

785
01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:29.685
Crazy. I saw a lot
of particles in the water.

786
01:01:29.719 --> 01:01:31.920
High concentration
of plastic and all that

787
01:01:31.954 --> 01:01:34.923
and then on the surface.
there we saw. like. a bucket.

788
01:01:34.957 --> 01:01:37.626
nails and big plastic items.

789
01:01:38.261 --> 01:01:39.394
Very strange.

790
01:01:42.465 --> 01:01:45.500
<i>It was more than what
I could understand</i>

791
01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:47.302
and we had to stop

792
01:01:48.404 --> 01:01:51.006
because if we were
to collect the plastic.

793
01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.507
we would have spent all night.

794
01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:54.910
<i>We don't have time.
we have to go to the boat</i>

795
01:01:54.944 --> 01:01:58.180
and we have to let
this soup float around

796
01:01:58.214 --> 01:01:59.481
and just go away.

797
01:02:01.784 --> 01:02:03.485
<i>I don't know what to do
with this feeling.</i>

798
01:02:05.321 --> 01:02:06.822
<i>I just feel powerless.</i>

799
01:02:09.225 --> 01:02:10.926
<i>I'm probably angry at myself</i>

800
01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.928
<i>because I'm like everyone.</i>

801
01:02:12.962 --> 01:02:15.597
<i>We use plastic.
We throw away plastic.</i>

802
01:02:15.631 --> 01:02:18.800
But no one sees that.

803
01:02:18.835 --> 01:02:22.170
<i>It reminds me
how huge the problem is</i>

804
01:02:23.039 --> 01:02:25.540
and how hard it
will be to fix that.

805
01:02:27.844 --> 01:02:29.845
<i>So I cannot look at that</i>

806
01:02:29.879 --> 01:02:31.446
<i>and just do nothing.</i>

807
01:02:37.186 --> 01:02:38.653
[wind blowing]

808
01:02:44.994 --> 01:02:46.061
[bird squawking]

809
01:02:50.266 --> 01:02:51.099
Yeah.

810
01:03:04.213 --> 01:03:05.647
Real big swell.

811
01:03:05.681 --> 01:03:06.748
We've seen it coming

812
01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:08.917
but then it was just...
It's moving quick.

813
01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:10.585
Got 35 knots already.

814
01:03:42.952 --> 01:03:44.920
Okay. so the base
of the discussion

815
01:03:44.954 --> 01:03:46.855
is our ability to support Ben.

816
01:03:46.889 --> 01:03:50.258
Even if it means
three weeks of rough weather

817
01:03:50.293 --> 01:03:52.227
and one day of swim days.

818
01:03:52.261 --> 01:03:54.129
as long as Ben is here to swim.

819
01:03:54.730 --> 01:03:56.464
we are here for him.

820
01:03:59.702 --> 01:04:02.537
And so support Ben
as much as we can.

821
01:04:02.572 --> 01:04:04.039
every day we can.

822
01:04:04.073 --> 01:04:05.941
If something serious
happened to the main sail.

823
01:04:05.975 --> 01:04:07.976
we should maybe decide to leave.

824
01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:11.046
to not fall back
on something else.

825
01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:14.249
[scoffs] This is. like.
the opposite of my instinct.

826
01:04:14.317 --> 01:04:17.285
Is to say. "All right.
we're just gonna sit here

827
01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.955
until something goes wrong."

828
01:04:19.989 --> 01:04:23.024
It's. like. you leave
before that situation happens.

829
01:04:26.462 --> 01:04:29.931
I know I'm a very closed person.

830
01:04:29.966 --> 01:04:33.068
I don't show too much of my...
enthusiasm

831
01:04:33.102 --> 01:04:35.937
or too much of my sadness.
or if I'm gonna... you know.

832
01:04:36.772 --> 01:04:40.242
Obviously the weather
it's an issue.

833
01:04:40.276 --> 01:04:42.878
But the way
I look at it. it's. uh.

834
01:04:42.912 --> 01:04:46.248
more than just an expedition
from one point to another.

835
01:04:46.282 --> 01:04:49.784
For me. it's a way
to... to gauge the limits.

836
01:04:49.819 --> 01:04:53.221
When you are faced with
something that is

837
01:04:53.256 --> 01:04:56.625
a big challenge.
how do we all react to it?

838
01:04:58.761 --> 01:05:01.396
The expedition.
on a bigger picture.

839
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:02.364
it's what it is.

840
01:05:34.063 --> 01:05:35.997
[waves crashing]

841
01:05:50.246 --> 01:05:53.748
If we look. one. two. three.

842
01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:58.053
four-and-a-half days ahead.

843
01:05:58.087 --> 01:06:00.388
- look at this.
- Oh-ho-ho-ho.

844
01:06:00.423 --> 01:06:04.759
This is the first time I see
100 knots wind.

845
01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:06.494
- It's something we need to go away from.
- Yeah.

846
01:06:07.496 --> 01:06:09.064
[man 1] It's just dangerous.

847
01:06:14.036 --> 01:06:15.303
[man 2] Pretty nervous.

848
01:06:17.239 --> 01:06:19.708
We cannot get a coastguard
helicopter out here.

849
01:06:34.457 --> 01:06:36.891
[boat creaking]

850
01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:39.995
[rumbling and crashing]

851
01:06:49.138 --> 01:06:50.305
[woman]

852
01:07:00.983 --> 01:07:02.050
[woman]

853
01:07:19.635 --> 01:07:20.869
[grunting]

854
01:08:12.621 --> 01:08:16.991
This was only around
the high 40s. I think.

855
01:08:17.026 --> 01:08:20.829
and the typhoon
that's coming towards us

856
01:08:20.863 --> 01:08:23.531
is apparently 100 knots.

857
01:08:23.566 --> 01:08:25.900
So we don't want to be here.

858
01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:28.369
That's. like.
no more solar panels.

859
01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:31.206
no more wind generators.

860
01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:33.141
no more people.

861
01:08:33.175 --> 01:08:34.342
no more boat.

862
01:08:35.778 --> 01:08:37.178
And no more<i> Swim.</i>

863
01:09:10.613 --> 01:09:11.980
- [waves crashing]
- Whoa!

864
01:09:14.583 --> 01:09:16.084
[boat clattering]

865
01:09:16.118 --> 01:09:17.852
[man] Whoa! Down!

866
01:09:20.856 --> 01:09:23.091
[Maks]

867
01:09:31.033 --> 01:09:32.967
- It's very bad.
- It's very bad. yeah.

868
01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:39.941
Reef two just gave up.

869
01:09:40.476 --> 01:09:41.342
It snapped.

870
01:09:43.012 --> 01:09:45.914
On a sailboat.
you have a main sail

871
01:09:45.948 --> 01:09:47.448
and it's very big.

872
01:09:47.483 --> 01:09:49.784
According to the amount
of wind you get.

873
01:09:49.818 --> 01:09:51.119
you can make it smaller.

874
01:09:53.522 --> 01:09:56.157
Reefs make the sail smaller.

875
01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:58.459
You just don't want to have
too much sail

876
01:09:58.494 --> 01:09:59.527
when there's a lot of wind.

877
01:10:02.965 --> 01:10:04.799
[Ben]

878
01:10:04.833 --> 01:10:06.634
[Ty]

879
01:10:09.305 --> 01:10:12.106
We lost our second reef.

880
01:10:12.141 --> 01:10:14.142
All the stitches just...
[mimics exploding]

881
01:10:14.176 --> 01:10:15.176
Ripped apart.

882
01:10:20.849 --> 01:10:21.950
So it's not good.

883
01:10:30.426 --> 01:10:33.428
This is reef 2.
This tore off completely.

884
01:10:33.462 --> 01:10:37.232
There's a line pulling down
the edge of the sail

885
01:10:37.266 --> 01:10:38.866
attaching it to the boom.

886
01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:40.802
So this is
a very important part.

887
01:10:53.415 --> 01:10:56.084
Yeah. this is probably
the wrong. emotional thing

888
01:10:56.118 --> 01:10:58.953
but I would like to see
Ben in the water again. and...

889
01:10:58.988 --> 01:11:00.388
[Yoav]

890
01:11:00.422 --> 01:11:02.890
But. really. I think
we need to go. okay?

891
01:11:04.159 --> 01:11:06.094
We're already beyond
the safe zone.

892
01:11:16.739 --> 01:11:18.406
- I think it makes sense.
- Yeah.

893
01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:21.909
Ben?

894
01:11:28.884 --> 01:11:29.817
Ben?

895
01:11:32.154 --> 01:11:33.855
[Paul]

896
01:11:47.736 --> 01:11:51.572
I look at the same thing as them.
and I come to the same conclusions.

897
01:11:57.579 --> 01:12:00.048
You know. what I noticed
about the reef.

898
01:12:00.082 --> 01:12:02.917
is that they're all
being pulled from the bottom.

899
01:12:04.286 --> 01:12:08.256
So my thinking is that
putting less tension on the sail.

900
01:12:08.290 --> 01:12:11.559
making sure that when we
pull the reef.

901
01:12:11.593 --> 01:12:16.064
it is in the same direction
as whatever holds it.

902
01:12:16.098 --> 01:12:19.300
The way it's being pulled right
now. it's the wrong configuration.

903
01:12:20.202 --> 01:12:21.502
Reef 2 is already gone.

904
01:12:21.537 --> 01:12:24.872
We can't... It's the best one.
we need to get home.

905
01:12:24.907 --> 01:12:25.907
and it's gone.

906
01:12:27.076 --> 01:12:29.043
They all break at the bottom.

907
01:12:29.078 --> 01:12:32.880
meaning that the tension
is too much in that direction.

908
01:12:32.915 --> 01:12:36.017
To try a new way now

909
01:12:36.051 --> 01:12:38.553
could mean that we break
the last thing that we...

910
01:12:38.587 --> 01:12:40.188
Yeah. it's not trying
a new thing.

911
01:12:40.222 --> 01:12:41.589
it's just putting less tension.

912
01:12:41.623 --> 01:12:43.024
So by putting less tension.

913
01:12:43.058 --> 01:12:45.593
you have less likelihood
to break it.

914
01:12:45.627 --> 01:12:48.730
Ben. finding an innovative way
to do it doesn't change

915
01:12:48.764 --> 01:12:50.732
- the current state of the reef.
- Yeah.

916
01:12:50.766 --> 01:12:53.601
We seriously damaged
our main sail

917
01:12:53.635 --> 01:12:56.738
which is our main sail.

918
01:12:56.772 --> 01:12:58.840
Any solution we now have
is not enough.

919
01:12:58.874 --> 01:13:02.710
I think we need to go when we still
have some control on our situation.

920
01:13:02.744 --> 01:13:06.314
Any day longer that we
stay here in these conditions.

921
01:13:06.348 --> 01:13:08.516
it worries the shit out of me.

922
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:11.853
[clears throat] I'm kind of
against nine people.

923
01:13:16.859 --> 01:13:20.161
I'm not in the position
right now

924
01:13:20.195 --> 01:13:22.830
where I want to throw the towel

925
01:13:22.865 --> 01:13:24.332
and say. "Okay. let's go home."

926
01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:42.717
[Paul]

927
01:13:46.889 --> 01:13:48.322
It's not different...

928
01:13:48.357 --> 01:13:49.791
I see the risk.

929
01:13:49.825 --> 01:13:52.126
The risk. is it worth taking?

930
01:13:52.161 --> 01:13:55.096
Yeah. for me. I'm willing
to push the limits.

931
01:13:55.130 --> 01:13:57.832
These are limits of sailing and these
are not the limits we came to test.

932
01:13:58.801 --> 01:14:02.537
For me. uh.
it will never be enough.

933
01:14:02.571 --> 01:14:04.539
That's not about you. that's
not about your limits here.

934
01:14:04.573 --> 01:14:08.075
it's about survival.

935
01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:10.211
I'm not talking about
my personal limit.

936
01:14:10.245 --> 01:14:12.880
but I'm talking about
the limits in general

937
01:14:12.915 --> 01:14:14.549
of what that boat will take.

938
01:14:14.583 --> 01:14:17.652
I'm willing to push further
than anybody else.

939
01:14:17.686 --> 01:14:19.520
That's why I have
a different mindset.

940
01:14:19.555 --> 01:14:22.690
I'm trying to explain for me
why it is a failure

941
01:14:23.525 --> 01:14:25.593
and that will never change.

942
01:14:25.627 --> 01:14:27.028
That's all.

943
01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:03.998
[electric shaver whirring]

944
01:15:18.247 --> 01:15:19.313
Yeah.

945
01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:20.648
- [laughing]
- Please keep that.

946
01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:22.450
Please.

947
01:15:22.484 --> 01:15:23.985
That's so good.

948
01:15:24.019 --> 01:15:25.786
Yeah. it's crazy.

949
01:15:25.821 --> 01:15:26.988
It's freaking awesome.

950
01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:30.791
Yeah. I have
a mustache envy right now.

951
01:15:31.293 --> 01:15:32.159
Like. big time.

952
01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:33.461
[chuckling]

953
01:15:34.596 --> 01:15:35.696
[whistling]

954
01:15:40.969 --> 01:15:42.303
[electric shaver whirring]

955
01:15:58.587 --> 01:15:59.921
[mouthing]

956
01:16:01.323 --> 01:16:02.590
[laughing]

957
01:16:06.361 --> 01:16:09.063
[phone line ringing]

958
01:16:09.097 --> 01:16:12.033
- [Trinh]<i> Hello?</i>
- Hello! How are you?

959
01:16:13.068 --> 01:16:15.202
<i>Hey. happy Thanksgiving.</i>

960
01:16:15.236 --> 01:16:18.806
Yeah. I'm calling to wish you
happy Thanksgiving too.

961
01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.575
<i>- Hi. Dad.</i>
- How are you. Ana?

962
01:16:21.176 --> 01:16:23.411
<i>- Good.</i>
- [Max]<i> Hey. Dad.</i>

963
01:16:23.445 --> 01:16:25.513
- Max. is that you?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

964
01:16:25.547 --> 01:16:27.148
I will be there for Christmas.

965
01:16:27.182 --> 01:16:29.317
What do you want me
to bring you from the ocean?

966
01:16:29.351 --> 01:16:30.918
I have a lot of plastic.

967
01:16:31.687 --> 01:16:33.487
<i>- Uh. okay.</i>
- [chuckles]

968
01:16:33.522 --> 01:16:35.556
Enjoy your Thanksgiving. okay?

969
01:16:36.258 --> 01:16:37.992
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Bye-bye. love you.

970
01:16:38.026 --> 01:16:39.393
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Bye.

971
01:16:52.874 --> 01:16:55.376
Yeah. I've been thinking
about the trip

972
01:16:55.410 --> 01:16:56.844
and what we have accomplished.

973
01:16:57.879 --> 01:16:59.313
A lot of good things happened

974
01:16:59.348 --> 01:17:02.483
and also a lot of
disappointing moments.

975
01:17:03.251 --> 01:17:05.353
The moment also that to find out

976
01:17:05.387 --> 01:17:07.088
that the equipment broke

977
01:17:07.122 --> 01:17:10.257
and we won't be able
to pursue the world record.

978
01:17:10.292 --> 01:17:14.462
That was very disappointing
for me. very sad moment.

979
01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:21.102
Being in the water
with all those sea creature.

980
01:17:22.204 --> 01:17:23.604
<i>it is very unique</i>

981
01:17:23.639 --> 01:17:27.441
<i>because that's the only place
you can really enjoy</i>

982
01:17:27.476 --> 01:17:29.577
<i>that type of experience.</i>

983
01:17:36.118 --> 01:17:39.787
<i>Every time I see something
living in the ocean</i>

984
01:17:39.821 --> 01:17:42.089
<i>it reinforces the reason why</i>

985
01:17:42.124 --> 01:17:44.225
<i>we are doing this expedition.</i>

986
01:17:49.364 --> 01:17:50.564
<i>A hundred years ago.</i>

987
01:17:50.599 --> 01:17:54.835
<i>exploring the ocean was about
looking for treasure.</i>

988
01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:57.505
<i>For us.
it's re-exploring the ocean</i>

989
01:17:57.539 --> 01:18:00.374
<i>and we are looking for trash
and for debris.</i>

990
01:18:01.476 --> 01:18:04.745
And strangely enough.
when we find the debris.

991
01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:06.981
<i>we are somewhat happy</i>

992
01:18:07.015 --> 01:18:08.849
<i>and sad at the same time.</i>

993
01:18:08.884 --> 01:18:11.452
We are happy because it's
something that is tangible.

994
01:18:11.486 --> 01:18:15.756
<i>We can really put our finger
on what the problem is.</i>

995
01:18:15.791 --> 01:18:17.858
<i>but it's sad because
it shouldn't be there.</i>

996
01:18:20.896 --> 01:18:24.632
[Paul] For 160 days. we
were focused on the same goal.

997
01:18:24.666 --> 01:18:26.467
Put Ben in the water every day.

998
01:18:26.501 --> 01:18:30.071
I don't know.
it's like losing a big beacon

999
01:18:30.105 --> 01:18:31.972
that you have on
every day in mind.

1000
01:18:32.007 --> 01:18:37.178
and losing one of the main
reasons why you wake up.

1001
01:18:37.212 --> 01:18:39.647
<i>But it was very great
for everyone</i>

1002
01:18:39.681 --> 01:18:42.416
<i>to kind of shift
and allocate all our energy</i>

1003
01:18:42.451 --> 01:18:43.951
<i>to what is the expedition now</i>

1004
01:18:43.985 --> 01:18:46.253
<i>which is heading to Hawaii.</i>

1005
01:18:46.288 --> 01:18:48.255
And on the way. collecting trash

1006
01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:49.457
as many as we can.

1007
01:18:53.361 --> 01:18:56.197
The fact that we've only been making
plastic for a certain amount of time

1008
01:18:56.231 --> 01:18:58.599
and already. we have already

1009
01:18:58.633 --> 01:19:01.902
put plastic
absolutely everywhere...

1010
01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.440
I didn't expect it to be
so widespread.

1011
01:19:12.881 --> 01:19:14.048
Whoa!

1012
01:19:14.082 --> 01:19:16.584
This is the worst stuff 'cause
it breaks up so easy.

1013
01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:25.760
[Ty]<i> We had these amazing days</i>
<i>where the animals came to us</i>

1014
01:19:25.794 --> 01:19:28.162
<i>and I felt this
awe and appreciation</i>

1015
01:19:28.196 --> 01:19:29.964
<i>of the sheer beauty of them.</i>

1016
01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:34.235
<i>And then the trash came to us.</i>

1017
01:19:45.247 --> 01:19:47.414
[Paul]<i> It's like you are</i>
<i>working in the forest</i>

1018
01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:49.450
<i>and under the leaves.</i>

1019
01:19:50.418 --> 01:19:52.052
<i>there is a layer of plastic.</i>

1020
01:19:55.123 --> 01:19:56.757
<i>Plastic is our signature
in the ocean.</i>

1021
01:20:09.571 --> 01:20:10.604
Sample.

1022
01:20:11.573 --> 01:20:14.208
All of this. this is of plastic.

1023
01:20:14.242 --> 01:20:15.209
hundreds and hundreds.

1024
01:20:15.243 --> 01:20:18.546
like. four. every five minutes
around the boat.

1025
01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:21.315
<i>This big debris are only
the tip of the iceberg.</i>

1026
01:20:21.349 --> 01:20:23.184
<i>It is everywhere
under the surface.</i>

1027
01:20:29.024 --> 01:20:30.424
<i>The ocean is plastic.</i>

1028
01:21:09.364 --> 01:21:10.631
We are there!

1029
01:21:13.268 --> 01:21:15.302
[cheering]

1030
01:21:17.906 --> 01:21:20.641
Guys. there is
a very weird albatross.

1031
01:21:20.675 --> 01:21:22.509
[crew cheering]

1032
01:21:23.745 --> 01:21:25.079
So cool!

1033
01:21:25.947 --> 01:21:27.348
City. There's a city here.

1034
01:21:29.351 --> 01:21:31.418
It's the magic gate to Hawaii.

1035
01:21:33.121 --> 01:21:35.122
It's wonderful to see
the color green again.

1036
01:21:35.156 --> 01:21:38.325
I'm so excited for how we will
arrive in Hawaii.

1037
01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:41.562
Taste different food.
go for beers.

1038
01:21:41.596 --> 01:21:43.163
Just meet people. [chuckles]

1039
01:21:46.935 --> 01:21:48.569
Look at this.

1040
01:21:48.603 --> 01:21:51.272
We are putting all the garbage
that we found on the deck.

1041
01:21:53.475 --> 01:21:57.344
We are approaching one mile.

1042
01:22:01.349 --> 01:22:02.983
That's very rare.
that's a Ben smile.

1043
01:22:12.727 --> 01:22:14.061
Everything has an end.

1044
01:22:23.672 --> 01:22:25.005
Ty is going in.

1045
01:22:26.007 --> 01:22:28.475

When I was little. in France.

I remember being at the beach
with my parents.

1061

<i>I never remember
finding plastic in the sand.</i>

1062

<i>Now. everywhere you step on the
beach. you are going to find plastic.</i>

So just in my lifetime. it's
like... [mimics explosion]

<i>Now I see the ocean
and it's in peril right now.</i>

1069
01:25:17.846 --> 01:25:22.416
<i>If I love it. I better do
anything I can to try to protect it.</i>
