Maybe.

25
00:07:53.734 --> 00:07:55.170
[Chantelle] You're all sweaty.

I was trying
not to notice.

30
00:08:07.095 --> 00:08:08.313
It's annoying.

31
00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:10.011
You want me
to shoot it for you?

32
00:08:10.751 --> 00:08:11.839
Yeah.

33
00:08:12.404 --> 00:08:15.669
Just have to find it first
and get a gun.

34
00:08:15.843 --> 00:08:19.020
I think I know where it is.
Gun in the drawer downstairs.

35
00:08:19.934 --> 00:08:21.631
What? No. there isn't.

36
00:08:21.805 --> 00:08:23.328
Yeah. In the living room.

37
00:08:24.634 --> 00:08:26.593
-Are you serious?
-Mm-hmm.

38
00:08:27.376 --> 00:08:30.074
-That can't be legal.
-It's John's uncle.

39
00:08:34.905 --> 00:08:36.341
You're happy?

40
00:08:38.474 --> 00:08:39.519
Very.

41
00:08:40.694 --> 00:08:41.738
And you?

42
00:08:43.087 --> 00:08:44.349
Despite being dragged here.

43
00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:46.482
[chuckles]
You were not dragged here.

44
00:08:49.311 --> 00:08:52.270
So. you're feeling recharged?

45
00:08:53.054 --> 00:08:54.229
I think so.

46
00:08:56.144 --> 00:08:58.363
Okay. let's maybe
give it a couple more days

47
00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:00.714
before making
any bold statements.

48
00:09:02.063 --> 00:09:04.065
I'm very happy
when I'm here with you.

49
00:09:04.239 --> 00:09:06.589
Oh. yeah?
When are you here without me?

50
00:09:06.763 --> 00:09:08.504
I'm not.

51
00:09:08.678 --> 00:09:11.333
Not bringing any other women
here behind my back. are you?

52
00:09:11.986 --> 00:09:14.031
-It's an interesting idea.
-[Chantelle chuckles]

53
00:09:14.205 --> 00:09:16.468
-Oy!
-Easy. tiger.

54
00:09:18.383 --> 00:09:21.169
I think we should
go out for breakfast.

55
00:09:21.996 --> 00:09:23.127
[William] Where?

56
00:09:26.696 --> 00:09:28.437
Can we go somewhere
with a little bit more life?

57
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.180
There isn't anywhere.
Not in walking distance.

58
00:09:32.659 --> 00:09:34.051
Their coffee's crap.

59
00:09:34.225 --> 00:09:35.705
Then have tea.

60
00:09:35.879 --> 00:09:38.099
I'm not dignifying
that with a response.

61
00:09:39.013 --> 00:09:40.188
Okay.

62
00:09:40.362 --> 00:09:44.540
How about
we have coffee in bed

63
00:09:44.714 --> 00:09:47.021
and then
we have food after?

64
00:09:48.239 --> 00:09:49.327
Okay.

65
00:09:49.501 --> 00:09:52.853

[Chantelle] Hold-- hold up.

70
00:11:18.808 --> 00:11:19.853
What's wrong?

71
00:11:20.767 --> 00:11:22.507
Got something in my shoe.

72
00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:23.770
You want to go back?

73
00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.815
-No.
-If you want to go back.

74
00:11:25.989 --> 00:11:27.687
just say so.
don't make excuses.

75
00:11:29.863 --> 00:11:31.516
-See?
-Okay. then.

76
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:35.042
Do you hear that?

77
00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:37.131
What?

78
00:11:37.305 --> 00:11:38.523
Silence.

79
00:11:39.524 --> 00:11:40.700
[William] Mm-hmm.

80
00:11:43.224 --> 00:11:46.488
Sometimes I wish
we could just escape it all.

81
00:11:46.662 --> 00:11:47.924
Well. we have.

82
00:11:48.098 --> 00:11:50.753
No. I mean. like.
permanently. you know?

83
00:11:50.927 --> 00:11:53.451
Just leave everything behind

84
00:11:53.625 --> 00:11:55.845
and start fresh
in a place like this.

85
00:11:56.019 --> 00:11:58.500
It's a nice idea.
but it's too quiet here.

86
00:11:58.674 --> 00:12:01.155
-It would get boring.
-Quiet is good.

87
00:12:01.329 --> 00:12:02.939
Boring is good.

88
00:12:03.635 --> 00:12:06.377
Escaping the rat race.
even better.

89
00:12:06.551 --> 00:12:07.814
You'd miss the noise.

90
00:12:07.988 --> 00:12:09.467
You'd want
to go home in a month.

91
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:14.472
What if we just did it?
What if we just relocate?

92
00:12:15.256 --> 00:12:18.563
-People would miss us.
-Yeah. but would we miss them?

93
00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:20.217
Maybe. Maybe not.

94
00:12:20.783 --> 00:12:21.915
[rustling]

95
00:12:22.567 --> 00:12:23.786
Do you hear that?

96
00:12:24.569 --> 00:12:25.745
What now?

97
00:12:26.571 --> 00:12:28.356
I thought
I heard something.

98
00:12:29.052 --> 00:12:31.881
-Was it the silence again?
-Very funny.

99
00:12:32.926 --> 00:12:35.755
No. it was like
something was moving.

100
00:12:35.929 --> 00:12:38.758
-It was probably a squirrel.
-It was bigger than that.

101
00:12:39.236 --> 00:12:41.586
You do get rabid
badgers in these parts.

102
00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:42.892
All right. shut up.

103
00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:47.157
What if it's an escaped convict
or an ax murderer. huh?

104
00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:49.333
[William] Then I guess
I'd have to kick his ass.

105
00:12:50.334 --> 00:12:52.162
Come on. let's get going
before it rains.

106

[fire crackling faintly]

111
00:14:46.798 --> 00:14:48.975
You know it's far too warm
a night to have a fire going.

112
00:14:49.758 --> 00:14:52.500
-It's romantic.
-It is.

113
00:14:54.067 --> 00:14:56.460
I think we should
come back here every year.

114
00:14:57.809 --> 00:14:59.811
There's more places for us to
see than just here. you know?

115
00:14:59.986 --> 00:15:02.814
Yeah. but this
is our place.

116
00:15:02.989 --> 00:15:04.512
It's special.

117
00:15:05.165 --> 00:15:06.427
It doesn't have
a hot tub.

118
00:15:07.776 --> 00:15:09.865
Okay. what is your obsession
with hot tubs?

119
00:15:10.431 --> 00:15:12.389
You know there's
a perfectly good bath. right?

120
00:15:13.347 --> 00:15:14.914
That's not the same.

121
00:15:25.315 --> 00:15:26.447
What's wrong?

122
00:15:28.797 --> 00:15:31.191
You will always look after me.
won't you. William?

123
00:15:33.845 --> 00:15:35.847
I think we better
not have any more wine.

124
00:15:36.022 --> 00:15:39.286
No. I'm not kidding.
You will. right?

125
00:15:40.678 --> 00:15:42.680
-You know that.
-Well. then say it.

126
00:15:44.117 --> 00:15:45.727
I'm being serious.

127
00:15:49.557 --> 00:15:52.429
Okay.
I'll always take care of you.

128
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.128
Where is this
coming from anyway?

129
00:15:57.782 --> 00:15:59.045
I don't know just...

130
00:16:00.698 --> 00:16:01.786
I want to feel safe.

131
00:16:02.918 --> 00:16:05.399
You are safe.
Nothing bad is gonna happen.

132
00:16:07.618 --> 00:16:10.143
I just
get this feeling like...

133
00:16:11.883 --> 00:16:13.973
It's like
we've been here before.

134
00:16:14.147 --> 00:16:15.452
but it's different.

135
00:16:17.541 --> 00:16:19.282
Maybe it's what's ahead.

136
00:16:21.763 --> 00:16:22.938
Okay.

137
00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.556
I feel like
I know what's coming.

138
00:16:34.471 --> 00:16:35.907
And it doesn't
feel good.

139
00:16:36.647 --> 00:16:38.910
But this is good.
Right here. right now.

140
00:16:41.522 --> 00:16:42.697
This is all we need.

141
00:16:43.219 --> 00:16:46.570
Just you and me
together. yeah?

142
00:16:47.702 --> 00:16:48.790
Yeah.

143
00:16:49.356 --> 00:16:50.400
Yeah.

144
00:16:50.574 --> 00:16:53.055

[music stops]

148
00:17:40.102 --> 00:17:42.017
[Chantelle] Hurry up.
It's starting to rain.

149
00:17:46.108 --> 00:17:48.719
-Shit.
-What's wrong?

150
00:17:49.981 --> 00:17:52.506
-I scraped my wrist.
-Here. let me see.

151
00:17:56.597 --> 00:17:58.642
Yeah. I think you'll live.

152
00:17:59.295 --> 00:18:00.862
[William] You reckon?

153
00:18:01.036 --> 00:18:02.864
I mean. if we get you
back to the cottage in time.

154
00:18:03.038 --> 00:18:04.866
we might even
save the hand.

155
00:18:05.519 --> 00:18:06.694
[William]
Well. that's a relief.

156
00:18:08.217 --> 00:18:10.350
Better be careful
injuring yourself like that.

157
00:18:10.524 --> 00:18:12.352
Don't want people
to think you're self-harming.

158
00:18:18.575 --> 00:18:21.274
[Chantelle sobbing]

[distant howling]

173
00:22:46.408 --> 00:22:48.889
[Chantelle]
So I don't know when exactly.

174
00:22:49.063 --> 00:22:51.326
but she is definitely
going to come.

175
00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.068
I think probably
sometime at the end of October.

176
00:22:58.464 --> 00:22:59.639
Well?

177
00:23:02.511 --> 00:23:03.904
Remember
what you said last time?

178
00:23:05.514 --> 00:23:06.646
When?

179
00:23:08.517 --> 00:23:10.127
Last time we were here.

180
00:23:10.867 --> 00:23:13.087
You said you had a feeling
like we'd been here before.

181
00:23:15.785 --> 00:23:16.830
Maybe.

182
00:23:18.353 --> 00:23:19.876
I'm feeling
like that right now.

183

And you call me strange?

184

Does this feel
real to you?

185

Does this feel like
we're actually here right now?

186
00:23:30.974 --> 00:23:32.106
Yes.

187
00:23:33.368 --> 00:23:35.501
Anyway. can we get back
to reality for a minute

188
00:23:35.675 --> 00:23:37.720
so you can actually
answer my question?

189

putting this off for ages.

are weird sometimes.

as well.

It was the same thing.

gone out. have you?

it's not safe.

233

I only went for a walk
down the road.

234
00:30:59.596 --> 00:31:00.728
[John] You didn't
want to see her?

235
00:31:00.902 --> 00:31:02.730
No.

236
00:31:02.904 --> 00:31:04.732
[John] It's too risky. all
right? You need to be smart.

237
00:31:04.906 --> 00:31:05.994
And. hey. you don't understand
what's going on out there.

238
00:31:06.168 --> 00:31:07.300
I think I do.

239

[John]
Listen to me. all right?

240
00:31:09.519 --> 00:31:10.129
You can't take a risk like
that again. Do you understand?

Okay. I won't.

Do you blame me?

you. you know that.

246
00:31:22.793 --> 00:31:24.143

247

going on back home.

What. you've been online?

00:31:38.635 --> 00:31:39.985
No.

255
00:31:40.159 --> 00:31:41.638
[John]
Where did you see it. then?

256
00:31:41.812 --> 00:31:43.814
-A newspaper.
-[John] Oh. for fuck's sake!

257
00:31:43.989 --> 00:31:45.207
They were on display
outside the shop.

258
00:31:45.381 --> 00:31:46.774
Nobody saw me.

259
00:31:46.948 --> 00:31:49.081
-I didn't go in.
-[John] For your own good.

260
00:31:49.255 --> 00:31:50.299
you've got to stay away
from people.

261
00:31:50.473 --> 00:31:51.735
We discussed this already.

262
00:31:52.475 --> 00:31:53.607
I know we did.

263
00:31:54.477 --> 00:31:55.652
I just had to do something.

264
00:31:56.218 --> 00:31:58.742
[John] You can't.
You have to stay in.

265

266
00:32:03.225 --> 00:32:04.748
I do appreciate
everything you've done.

267
00:32:05.271 --> 00:32:07.142
[John] Good.

268
00:32:07.316 --> 00:32:08.404
Because I'm in as much trouble
as you if we're found out.

269
00:32:10.754 --> 00:32:12.147
I'll be more careful.

270
00:32:12.321 --> 00:32:13.975

away from the TV

271
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:16.543

make any phone calls.

272
00:32:16.717 --> 00:32:18.153
I'll see if I can
get you next week.

273

Next week?

274
00:32:20.025 --> 00:32:21.287
[John]
I can't do earlier than that.

275
00:32:21.461 --> 00:32:22.810
I think
they might be watching me.

276
00:32:24.159 --> 00:32:25.465
Can you tell me
anything else?

277
00:32:25.639 --> 00:32:28.120
[John]
No. Now just stay inside.

watching me.

363
00:44:03.989 --> 00:44:05.991
Well. they're--
they're part of this now.

364
00:44:06.165 --> 00:44:07.645
But they're not real.

365
00:44:09.603 --> 00:44:10.909
And neither are you.

366
00:44:16.175 --> 00:44:18.830
I can assure you
this is very real.

367
00:44:19.004 --> 00:44:20.396
I'm not a figment
of your imagination

368
00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:21.702
and neither are they.

369
00:44:21.876 --> 00:44:23.573
You can't run
from the truth

370
00:44:23.748 --> 00:44:28.404
and you can't solve this
by causing harm to yourself.

371
00:44:31.233 --> 00:44:34.280
Yes. I know about that.

372
00:44:37.587 --> 00:44:40.460
And I can assure you.
it would solve nothing.

373
00:44:41.591 --> 00:44:43.419
It would put an end
to my suffering.

374
00:44:45.683 --> 00:44:49.251
Leaving
that thing outside. alone.

375
00:44:50.949 --> 00:44:52.472
It would start
all over again.

376
00:44:54.343 --> 00:44:55.954
It won't be like before.

377
00:44:56.955 --> 00:44:58.391
It's locked away.

I think
you should go now.

381

It'â€™s going to
happen again.

382
00:45:14.015 --> 00:45:16.931
And it's going to
keep on happening again

383
00:45:17.105 --> 00:45:20.021
unless you do
what needs to be done.

384
00:45:20.718 --> 00:45:22.807
We'll suffer
because of you.

do you think you need to know?

I don't see any danger.

to keep out of sight.

Of course you know.

don't understand it.

You want one?

467
00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:09.681
-Uh. maybe not.
-You know. I was thinking

468
00:54:09.855 --> 00:54:11.857
on the way over here.
we should really

469
00:54:12.031 --> 00:54:13.598
get a proper machine.

470
00:54:13.772 --> 00:54:16.035
just something we can
bring with us when we come.

471
00:54:16.209 --> 00:54:17.776
[Chantelle chuckles]
You're always complaining

472
00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:19.168
about the coffee
when we get here.

473
00:54:19.343 --> 00:54:21.258
so it'â€™d solve that problem.

00:54:22.650 --> 00:54:23.869
Hm.

00:54:24.043 --> 00:54:25.697

going to drive over

a few bits and pieces.

living off of deer

00:54:33.313 --> 00:54:35.620

make us a proper dinner.

come sit with me?

don't you think?

you're too hard on yourself.

it was the trip.

to worry about this right now.

something happened.

494

You don't remember that?

I don't know what
you're talking about.

It-- it was bad.

but it-- it was serious.

You're not well. William.

-Can you stop saying that?
-You need to stop this.

500
00:55:38.552 --> 00:55:39.858
And how did we
leave things?

501
00:55:40.032 --> 00:55:41.642
-Leave what things?
-Between you and me.

502
00:55:41.816 --> 00:55:43.992
-What does that matter?
-I want you to tell me

503
00:55:44.166 --> 00:55:45.907
how we left things
between you and me.

504
00:55:46.081 --> 00:55:47.561
Like normal. I suppose.

505
00:55:49.258 --> 00:55:51.304
But if the trip was the last
time I saw you. that was.

506
00:55:51.478 --> 00:55:52.653
what. two months ago?

507
00:55:52.827 --> 00:55:54.133
Yeah.
something like that.

508
00:55:54.307 --> 00:55:55.221
That can't be
the last time we spoke.

509
00:55:55.395 --> 00:55:57.179
I think it probably was.

510
00:55:57.354 --> 00:55:59.530
Two months since we last spoke
and that seems normal to you?

511
00:55:59.704 --> 00:56:01.967
We haven't spoken
for two whole months.

512
00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:04.448
Have you got your medication
here with you. William?

513

00:56:25.251 --> 00:56:26.339
You hear that?

517
00:56:27.558 --> 00:56:28.602
What?

Silence.

Same as it always is.

520
00:56:36.958 --> 00:56:38.438
I was hearing things
before at night.

What. more of your rabid
squirrels. was it? [chuckles]

522
00:56:47.055 --> 00:56:48.405
Have you ever thought
there was such a thing

as a perfect moment?

524
00:56:50.624 --> 00:56:51.669
Of course.

Beside perfect.

526
00:56:55.977 --> 00:56:57.414
you just wanted to
relive it again and again.

even though you knew
it wasn't real anymore.

528
00:57:03.115 --> 00:57:04.856
We don't need
to relive anything.

529
00:57:07.075 --> 00:57:08.250
There's something
going on here.

530
00:57:09.295 --> 00:57:10.339
I don't know what...

531
00:57:11.297 --> 00:57:12.907
but that thing
is out there in the woods...

532
00:57:14.256 --> 00:57:17.303
and we're just here.
you and me. together.

533
00:57:17.999 --> 00:57:20.306
Uh. you've lost me with that.

534
00:57:25.572 --> 00:57:27.139
I remember
something else from the trip.

535
00:57:28.836 --> 00:57:29.881
You got hurt.

536
00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:32.449
I got hurt?

537
00:57:37.018 --> 00:57:40.108
No. no. that'â€™s not right.
You must be imagining things.
