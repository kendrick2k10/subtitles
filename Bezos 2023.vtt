3
00:00:17.118 --> 00:00:18.952
Five. four...

4
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.421
Command engine start.

5
00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:22.790
Two. one. Ignition.

6
00:00:39.507 --> 00:00:41.475
WOMAN:
Oh. yeah. look at her go!

7
00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:43.677
Mission control has confirmed
New Shepard has cleared

8
00:00:43.811 --> 00:00:46.780
the tower on her way
to space from Launch Site One

9
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.684
in the west Texas desert with
Mannequin Skywalker on board.

10
00:00:55.656 --> 00:00:57.358
JEFF:
I was born into great wealth.

11
00:00:57.491 --> 00:00:59.227
Not monetary wealth.

12
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.994
but the wealth
of a loving family.

13
00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.365
A family that fostered
my curiosity

14
00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:07.000
and encouraged me
to dream big.

15
00:01:09.337 --> 00:01:13.741
My mom. Jackie. had me
when she was 17 years old.

16
00:01:15.843 --> 00:01:19.913
My dad's name is Miguel.
He adopted me when I was four.

17
00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.084
He was 16 when he came
to the United States

18
00:01:24.218 --> 00:01:27.488
from Cuba. shortly after
the Castro Regime.

19
00:01:30.324 --> 00:01:32.393
My dad didn't speak English

20
00:01:32.526 --> 00:01:34.862
and he did not have
an easy path.

21
00:01:34.995 --> 00:01:38.098
What he did have was grit
and determination.

22
00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:41.202
Together.
with my grandparents.

23
00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.036
these hard-working.

24
00:01:43.171 --> 00:01:46.039
resourceful. and loving
people made me who I am.

25
00:01:50.744 --> 00:01:53.447
I walked away from
a steady job on Wall Street

26
00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:56.450
into a Seattle garage
to pursue my dream.

27
00:01:56.917 --> 00:01:59.687
fully understanding
that it might not work.

28
00:02:00.788 --> 00:02:04.425
It feels just like yesterday
I was driving packages

29
00:02:04.558 --> 00:02:06.059
to the post office myself.

30
00:02:06.727 --> 00:02:10.298
dreaming that one day
we might afford a forklift.

31
00:02:13.434 --> 00:02:15.135
You earn trust slowly.
over time.

32
00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.205
doing hard things well.

33
00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:21.209
We offer fast shipping
and everyday low prices.

34
00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:23.977
We make promises
to our customers

35
00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:25.546
that we intend to keep.

36
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.816
We make principled decisions.

37
00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:32.653
however unpopular.
and our approach is working.

38
00:03:23.804 --> 00:03:26.039
Jeff. David just asked
about you. let's go.

39
00:03:26.173 --> 00:03:28.309
-We're late.
-Shit!

40
00:03:30.844 --> 00:03:33.947
Oh. my goodness.
how are you always late?

41
00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:35.883
'Cause I'm always working.

42
00:03:36.817 --> 00:03:38.719
Let's see how well that excuse
works on David.

43
00:03:40.688 --> 00:03:43.190
-Is this a sleeping bag?
-No.

44
00:03:49.497 --> 00:03:52.533
You do know that
that's a poor answer

45
00:03:52.666 --> 00:03:54.335
to tell me that
that's a jump bag

46
00:03:54.502 --> 00:03:55.969
instead of a sleeping bag

47
00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.738
when you have a pillow
sticking out of it?

48
00:03:57.871 --> 00:04:01.174
-You believe it.
-Come on. man.

49
00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:03.477
Okay. here we go.

50
00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:05.245
Mr. Bezos.
thanks for joining us.

51
00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:06.847
You mean. I had a choice?

52
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.516
Back to what
we were talking about.

53
00:04:08.682 --> 00:04:10.351
Look. we're not gonna
spend all day

54
00:04:10.484 --> 00:04:12.019
talking about how great
our quarter was.

55
00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:13.721
Our numbers are fine.

56
00:04:13.854 --> 00:04:15.389
but that's not
what we're gonna do.

57
00:04:15.523 --> 00:04:17.057
We wanna talk about
how we're gonna move

58
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.692
the business forward. right?

59
00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.728
So. I wanted to spend
a little time going over

60
00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:22.696
an idea that Anton
and his team brought us.

61
00:04:22.863 --> 00:04:25.666
Let's put it up on the board.
Online brokerage.

62
00:04:26.434 --> 00:04:29.570
The idea that we would
actually start transacting

63
00:04:29.703 --> 00:04:31.872
completely online.

64
00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.107
Where consumers
can go on and instantaneously

65
00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:35.843
execute a trade.

66
00:04:35.943 --> 00:04:38.045
Now. I think all of you
are kind of wondering

67
00:04:38.211 --> 00:04:39.713
how it's gonna affect us
on the fee side.

68
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.415
and there's gonna be less fee.

69
00:04:41.549 --> 00:04:43.216
but there's also gonna be
less cash going out.

70
00:04:43.351 --> 00:04:45.052
That's a win-win for everybody.
isn't it?

71
00:04:45.185 --> 00:04:47.721
As we move forward.
I wanna see good ideas.

72
00:04:47.855 --> 00:04:50.090
the next big idea.

73
00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.292
Does that make sense to you?

74
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.695
And remember one thing:

75
00:04:54.795 --> 00:04:56.263
It's all about the data.

76
00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:32.232
I don't know. I just...

77
00:05:33.601 --> 00:05:34.968
feel like I'm in a rut.

78
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.939
Sometimes like I don't want
to get back into writing.

79
00:05:39.106 --> 00:05:40.774
You should. 100%.

80
00:05:41.442 --> 00:05:44.445
Yeah. but there's
no money in that.

81
00:05:45.312 --> 00:05:46.680
Could be.

82
00:05:46.814 --> 00:05:48.482
You're an amazing writer.
you know that.

83
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.819
You're my husband.
you have to say that.

84
00:05:51.952 --> 00:05:53.454
I'm serious!

85
00:05:53.621 --> 00:05:55.088
Some of the stuff
you've written

86
00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:56.757
just makes me want to cry.

87
00:05:56.857 --> 00:05:58.859
-Ugh.
-And I have several times.

88
00:05:58.992 --> 00:06:00.528
-Oh. stop.

89
00:06:06.834 --> 00:06:09.369
You're amazingly talented.
You know that.

90
00:06:12.806 --> 00:06:14.341
Thank you.

91
00:06:15.943 --> 00:06:17.978
It's just easier said
than done sometimes.

92
00:06:20.514 --> 00:06:23.050
With the job and all. I just
don't have as much time for it.

93
00:06:25.786 --> 00:06:28.489
And it's not like
I don't love my job.

94
00:06:28.656 --> 00:06:30.891
I'm so grateful
for the opportunity. but...

95
00:06:32.526 --> 00:06:36.564
I never imagined myself
as a glorified secretary.

96
00:06:39.066 --> 00:06:40.568
You're not a secretary.

97
00:06:41.502 --> 00:06:43.336
You're a novelist trapped
in a boring job.

98
00:06:43.504 --> 00:06:45.205
believe me. I know.

99
00:06:45.338 --> 00:06:48.842
Yeah. VP of the company
understands.

100
00:06:50.678 --> 00:06:52.012
Things are good right now.

101
00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.749
but I always pictured I'd start
a business or something.

102
00:06:56.349 --> 00:06:58.652
Never thought that I'd just end
up as another hedge fund guy.

103
00:07:00.688 --> 00:07:02.089
Well. what's stopping you?

104
00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:05.225
Just gotta be there.

105
00:07:06.093 --> 00:07:07.995
No. seriously.

106
00:07:08.095 --> 00:07:10.197
what's-- what's stopping you
from starting your own company?

107
00:07:10.363 --> 00:07:11.932
A business idea.

108
00:07:12.065 --> 00:07:14.067
There's the logistics.
the supply chain.

109
00:07:14.201 --> 00:07:15.703
I-- I don't know
the first thing

110
00:07:15.836 --> 00:07:17.538
about getting a business off
the ground.

111
00:07:18.038 --> 00:07:20.541
Plus. I have a steady job.
why would I risk that?

112
00:07:20.708 --> 00:07:22.710
No. no. Forget that!

113
00:07:22.876 --> 00:07:24.377
You can get another job
if you wanted to.

114
00:07:24.545 --> 00:07:26.046
I mean. with a mind like yours.

115
00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:27.781
you'd get hired
anywhere in an instant.

116
00:07:28.916 --> 00:07:30.217
Seriously.

117
00:07:33.754 --> 00:07:36.356
If you wanna start
your own company.

118
00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:38.225
you should go for it.

119
00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:44.798
You're right.
You're right.

120
00:07:44.932 --> 00:07:46.567
No more excuses.

121
00:07:49.402 --> 00:07:50.738
And there is something.

122
00:07:52.072 --> 00:07:53.473
I read an article
the other day.

123
00:07:54.041 --> 00:07:59.780
Did you know that the internet
is growing at 2.300% a year?

124
00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:03.250
Holy shit. that's a lot.

125
00:08:03.416 --> 00:08:07.254
Yeah. That's an understatement.
Nothing grows at 2.300%.

126
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.722
Ever.

127
00:08:11.925 --> 00:08:13.293
Yeah.

128
00:08:14.094 --> 00:08:18.265
I mean. that's the
million-dollar idea. I guess.

129
00:08:18.398 --> 00:08:20.433
It's-- It's numbers. really.

130
00:08:20.601 --> 00:08:23.270
but if I could find a way
to capitalize on it...

131
00:08:24.304 --> 00:08:26.640
I mean. imagine
if we started a business

132
00:08:26.774 --> 00:08:29.442
and in its first year
did a million dollars in sales

133
00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.411
and grew 2.300%.

134
00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:33.947
That means its second year
would do $23 million.

135
00:08:34.114 --> 00:08:36.183
and then if it grew
another 2.300%

136
00:08:36.316 --> 00:08:39.687
it would do $529 million
in its third year.

137
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:44.324
-Wow.
-Yeah.

138
00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:47.961
Could be the idea
David's been looking for.

139
00:08:49.663 --> 00:08:51.131
Well. are you gonna
tell him about it?

140
00:08:51.665 --> 00:08:54.201
Not yet. I don't even know
what we're gonna sell.

141
00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:58.606
Whatever it is...

142
00:09:00.641 --> 00:09:01.942
it could be big.

143
00:10:50.818 --> 00:10:53.486
Move!
First time in New York?

144
00:11:35.162 --> 00:11:36.496
-Jeff! Jeff!
-One quick minute.

145
00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:38.031
Jeff. he's on a call!

146
00:11:38.165 --> 00:11:39.366
A great opportunity.

147
00:11:39.499 --> 00:11:40.801
I'd-- It'd be a real honor.

148
00:11:41.468 --> 00:11:42.702
Absolutely.

149
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.038
I agree.

150
00:11:45.172 --> 00:11:47.374
-What is this?
-Tomorrow's best idea.

151
00:11:47.507 --> 00:11:49.276
Okay. Tom.
let me give you a call back.

152
00:11:49.376 --> 00:11:50.944
something just came up. okay?

153
00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:52.345
Hey. thanks so much.

154
00:11:54.147 --> 00:11:55.949
That was a friend
at the White House.

155
00:11:56.817 --> 00:11:58.285
President's asking me
to be on his council

156
00:11:58.385 --> 00:12:00.120
for science and technology.

157
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.856
-Congratulations.
-Well. it's important. right?

158
00:12:03.323 --> 00:12:05.192
But obviously
not as important as this.

159
00:12:05.325 --> 00:12:09.396
Tell me something that grows
at a 2.300% annual growth rate.

160
00:12:09.529 --> 00:12:12.032
Outside of petri dishes.
nothing.

161
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.368
Forget about it. keep reading.
Right there.

162
00:12:15.502 --> 00:12:17.237
That's a month's work.
right there.

163
00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:19.172
Jeff.
if you don't shut the fuck up

164
00:12:19.339 --> 00:12:20.908
it's gonna take me
a month to read it.

165
00:12:21.508 --> 00:12:23.076
Forget about it.
Let me bottom line it.

166
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.513
-Books.
-Books? That's your idea?

167
00:12:26.646 --> 00:12:27.848
It's tomorrow's best idea.

168
00:12:27.981 --> 00:12:29.549
The one
you've been looking for.

169
00:12:29.682 --> 00:12:32.052
Jeff. I haven't been looking
for books. In fact.

170
00:12:32.185 --> 00:12:34.354
I don't even know what
the fuck you're talking about.

171
00:12:34.487 --> 00:12:36.689
-Have you gotten any sleep?
-Let me explain it to you.

172
00:12:36.824 --> 00:12:39.860
See. millions of copies of
books are published every year

173
00:12:39.993 --> 00:12:42.362
and-- and millions more
internationally.

174
00:12:42.863 --> 00:12:45.933
but a physical store can only
carry several thousand books.

175
00:12:46.066 --> 00:12:47.667
Well. that's true
of any retailer.

176
00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:49.169
Right. take Barnes & Noble.

177
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:52.005
$1.6 billion a year in sales.

178
00:12:52.705 --> 00:12:55.775
But any physical
Barnes & Noble store

179
00:12:55.909 --> 00:12:58.078
only has thousands of copies.

180
00:12:58.912 --> 00:13:02.382
Now. add several
of Barnes & Noble stores.

181
00:13:02.549 --> 00:13:04.451
and you still
have thousands of copies.

182
00:13:04.584 --> 00:13:07.120
But there's potentially
millions of copies

183
00:13:07.254 --> 00:13:09.589
that could be sold.
but not in a physical store.

184
00:13:10.891 --> 00:13:13.726
Now. imagine a virtual store

185
00:13:16.563 --> 00:13:19.766
that was open 24 hours a day.
seven days a week.

186
00:13:21.534 --> 00:13:24.637
and could carry an infinite
amount of books.

187
00:13:24.771 --> 00:13:26.874
potentially every book
that ever existed.

188
00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.076
Jeff. do me a favor.

189
00:13:29.209 --> 00:13:31.078
Go wash up. shave.

190
00:13:31.211 --> 00:13:32.645
and that sleeping bag
that you have?

191
00:13:32.779 --> 00:13:34.481
Go take a little nap.

192
00:13:34.614 --> 00:13:37.150
And I want you to meet me
in the park in an hour. okay?

193
00:13:57.104 --> 00:14:00.107
-You clean up nice.
-Thanks. David.

194
00:14:00.673 --> 00:14:03.810
You know. it's a great idea
with a good plan.

195
00:14:06.779 --> 00:14:08.748
I'm so relieved you--
you liked it.

196
00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:10.450
I mean. with 76--

197
00:14:10.617 --> 00:14:12.519
Take a look at that guy
over there.

198
00:14:14.754 --> 00:14:16.456
Now take a look at that guy.

199
00:14:19.426 --> 00:14:21.028
Which one
do you think's happier?

200
00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:25.532
-The one with the hotdog.
-Why do you say that?

201
00:14:25.665 --> 00:14:27.834
He's living for the moment.

202
00:14:27.968 --> 00:14:30.637
Does that mean that the other
guy's miserable? Right?

203
00:14:31.304 --> 00:14:32.973
Maybe. Yeah.

204
00:14:33.106 --> 00:14:35.976
Let's jump ahead 20 years
to 2014.

205
00:14:36.109 --> 00:14:37.877
Who do you think's
gonna be happier.

206
00:14:38.011 --> 00:14:40.313
the guy eating hotdogs
that didn't plan for his future

207
00:14:40.447 --> 00:14:42.215
or the guy
who worked his ass off

208
00:14:42.349 --> 00:14:44.151
to get where he wanted to go?

209
00:14:44.651 --> 00:14:47.120
People always make
the same mistake.

210
00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.456
They focus on short-term goals
instead of planning

211
00:14:49.556 --> 00:14:51.959
for the future. instead
of planning for the future

212
00:14:52.059 --> 00:14:54.694
and using a short-term strategy
to execute it.

213
00:14:55.528 --> 00:14:57.998
You're the youngest
vice president

214
00:14:58.165 --> 00:15:00.467
of the fastest growing
hedge fund in America.

215
00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.735
You make a six-figure salary.

216
00:15:03.503 --> 00:15:05.672
Your coworkers respect you.

217
00:15:05.838 --> 00:15:08.408
and you want to throw all of
that away to. what. sell books?

218
00:15:09.542 --> 00:15:10.810
I thought you liked the idea.
David.

219
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.312
I do like the idea.

220
00:15:12.412 --> 00:15:14.214
I actually think
it's a great idea.

221
00:15:14.347 --> 00:15:16.416
but it's not for me.

222
00:15:16.549 --> 00:15:19.186
and I definitely don't think
it's for you.

223
00:15:19.852 --> 00:15:22.389
Jeff. you're brilliant
and you're ambitious

224
00:15:22.522 --> 00:15:24.357
and I love that about you.

225
00:15:25.858 --> 00:15:29.196
but. ultimately.
you have to think bigger. okay?

226
00:15:29.362 --> 00:15:31.564
You have a career to grow.
and you have places to go

227
00:15:31.698 --> 00:15:33.200
and you have a family
to take care of

228
00:15:33.366 --> 00:15:34.767
and your wife wants
to move your--

229
00:15:34.901 --> 00:15:36.369
your whole family forward.

230
00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:39.406
But I don't think that's
gonna happen with your plan.

231
00:15:43.376 --> 00:15:44.911
Okay? Let's head out.

232
00:15:49.049 --> 00:15:50.583
Well.
what Alisson should know--

233
00:15:50.717 --> 00:15:52.552
MAN ON TV:
What is internet. anyway?

234
00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.689
Internet is that
massive computer network.

235
00:15:56.789 --> 00:15:58.891
Starting your own business
is one of the most

236
00:15:59.059 --> 00:16:00.960
challenging things you can do.

237
00:16:01.094 --> 00:16:03.196
The risk often outweighs
the rewards.

238
00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:05.732
but I'm telling you.
if you know what you're doing

239
00:16:05.898 --> 00:16:07.434
and you got nothing
to lose.

240
00:16:07.567 --> 00:16:09.536
then why not. right?

241
00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:12.039
That's because fear-- fear is
what runs the human heart.

242
00:16:12.139 --> 00:16:14.107
Hey.

243
00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:16.109
But if you got the
guts to face what's ahead--

244
00:16:16.243 --> 00:16:19.779
-When'd you get home?
-A little while ago.

245
00:16:19.912 --> 00:16:21.748
I didn't have
two pennies to rub together.

246
00:16:21.881 --> 00:16:23.783
But I didn't let it
slow me down. you know why?

247
00:16:23.916 --> 00:16:25.585
I'll tell you why.
When I was a kid.

248
00:16:25.718 --> 00:16:27.454
I used to caddy at this
country club.

249
00:16:27.587 --> 00:16:28.988
And every morning...

250
00:16:32.125 --> 00:16:35.095
Brought some take out.
You hungry?

251
00:16:38.731 --> 00:16:40.500
Those biscuits
will ruin your dinner.

252
00:16:45.938 --> 00:16:48.941
-What'd you get?
-Chinese.

253
00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:12.832
So... you gonna tell me
why you left work early today?

254
00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:18.037
No reason.

255
00:17:18.638 --> 00:17:20.873
Oh. come on. I know
you had your pitch with David

256
00:17:21.007 --> 00:17:23.310
and look at you.
you're wallowing in self-pity.

257
00:17:23.843 --> 00:17:25.145
No. I'm not.

258
00:17:25.312 --> 00:17:26.679
Jeff. you're a terrible liar.

259
00:17:29.616 --> 00:17:31.151
He's not interested. okay?

260
00:17:32.452 --> 00:17:33.720
Well. why not?

261
00:17:33.853 --> 00:17:35.188
He said it was a great idea.

262
00:17:35.322 --> 00:17:37.056
just not for the company
or for me.

263
00:17:38.024 --> 00:17:39.726
What the hell's that
supposed to mean?

264
00:17:39.859 --> 00:17:42.362
It means I shouldn't be
taking risks like this.

265
00:17:43.496 --> 00:17:46.166
And he asked me. would I risk
everything for this idea?

266
00:17:46.299 --> 00:17:47.900
And. honestly. I wouldn't.

267
00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:50.503
Well.
why wouldn't you risk it all?

268
00:17:52.905 --> 00:17:55.408
I don't think the risk
is worth the opportunity.

269
00:17:56.909 --> 00:18:00.180
I have a steady career.
we have a family.

270
00:18:01.348 --> 00:18:02.815
What if we wanna
have kids one day?

271
00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:04.851
I can't be living
with this kind of risk.

272
00:18:05.017 --> 00:18:07.587
Whoa. whoa. hold up there.
cowboy.

273
00:18:09.522 --> 00:18:12.859
Listen. if we wanna have kids.

274
00:18:13.025 --> 00:18:14.861
we'll discuss
that in the future.

275
00:18:15.362 --> 00:18:16.729
Later on down the line.

276
00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:20.533
As for your job.
you can get another one.

277
00:18:21.401 --> 00:18:23.536
You're Jeff Bezos.

278
00:18:23.703 --> 00:18:26.706
the youngest VP
in the history of D.E. Shaw.

279
00:18:26.839 --> 00:18:28.775
you really think
this is your only opportunity

280
00:18:28.908 --> 00:18:30.210
for a good job in the future?

281
00:18:31.378 --> 00:18:32.612
Hell no!

282
00:18:33.213 --> 00:18:35.047
Whatever it is
you choose to do.

283
00:18:35.182 --> 00:18:37.550
you're going to be
incredible at.

284
00:18:39.051 --> 00:18:40.453
I know it.

285
00:18:41.388 --> 00:18:44.224
And if this is something
that you wanna do.

286
00:18:44.724 --> 00:18:46.092
then I believe in you.

287
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.796
And you need to believe
in yourself.

288
00:18:49.929 --> 00:18:52.765
'cause you're not just someone
who takes unnecessary risks.

289
00:18:52.899 --> 00:18:56.269
you're someone who-- who
looks at the possibilities.

290
00:18:56.403 --> 00:18:58.070
runs the numbers.

291
00:18:58.238 --> 00:19:00.106
and then takes the chances
that are worth taking!

292
00:19:04.611 --> 00:19:06.746
You said to think
about the future. right?

293
00:19:10.082 --> 00:19:12.219
Is D.E. Shaw
really what you envision

294
00:19:12.319 --> 00:19:14.053
for the rest of your life?

295
00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.942
Regret... minimization.

296
00:19:38.311 --> 00:19:39.946
What?

297
00:19:41.948 --> 00:19:43.950
Regret minimization framework.

298
00:19:44.116 --> 00:19:46.319
I need to minimize
the amount of regrets

299
00:19:46.453 --> 00:19:47.787
that I'm gonna have by age 80.

300
00:19:48.921 --> 00:19:51.291
Okay. that's--
that's one way to look at it.

301
00:19:53.092 --> 00:19:55.962
See. I'm not gonna regret being
a part of this Internet thing.

302
00:19:56.095 --> 00:19:59.432
but I will regret not trying.
and if it fails. who cares?

303
00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.635
I'm not living my life
in regret.

304
00:20:03.503 --> 00:20:04.804
So. you're gonna go for it?

305
00:20:04.971 --> 00:20:06.205
Yeah. we're going for it!

306
00:20:07.006 --> 00:20:10.109
All right. Internet man!
So. what's our next move?

307
00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:11.611
We're quitting our jobs.

308
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.816
I'm sorry. We?

309
00:20:17.317 --> 00:20:19.486
Yeah. I'm not doing
this without you.

310
00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:23.890
And we're not starting
a business venture here.

311
00:20:25.024 --> 00:20:27.860
-I need you.
-But-- But...

312
00:20:27.994 --> 00:20:29.362
We can do this.

313
00:20:31.498 --> 00:20:32.732
It's gonna be okay.

314
00:20:33.833 --> 00:20:36.503
We have savings.
we're gonna be together.

315
00:20:38.471 --> 00:20:39.706
You can have time to write.

316
00:20:44.977 --> 00:20:46.212
It's gonna work out.

317
00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.850
-Okay. Okay. I'm in.
-Okay? Doing it?

318
00:20:51.017 --> 00:20:52.385
-We're doing it.
-We're doing it!

319
00:20:56.055 --> 00:20:58.925
-You're amazing.
-I'm so excited for us.

320
00:20:59.058 --> 00:21:00.593
This is gonna work.

321
00:21:00.727 --> 00:21:03.229
-I'm scared. but I'm excited.
-I'm scared. too!

322
00:21:04.731 --> 00:21:06.065
Zander.

323
00:21:06.198 --> 00:21:07.834
Hey. it's Jeff Bezos.

324
00:21:08.568 --> 00:21:13.373
Yeah. MacKenzie's great.
I'm starting a new business.

325
00:21:14.206 --> 00:21:15.708
We're gonna sell
on the Internet.

326
00:21:15.875 --> 00:21:17.910
Yeah. Warren. Internet.

327
00:21:18.044 --> 00:21:20.913
I-N-T-E-R-N-E-T.

328
00:21:23.049 --> 00:21:25.017
Yeah.
You have a modem. right?

329
00:21:26.386 --> 00:21:29.188
Yeah. you're gonna
go online and buy.

330
00:21:29.288 --> 00:21:31.558
You know how you said
if I ever had a big idea

331
00:21:31.691 --> 00:21:33.893
to call you and-- and. um--
This is it.

332
00:21:34.361 --> 00:21:36.062
We're starting a website.

333
00:21:37.063 --> 00:21:38.398
Website.

334
00:21:38.531 --> 00:21:40.733
Yeah. Nancy. Okay.

335
00:21:42.569 --> 00:21:45.472
Hmm. We don't have a name
for it yet.

336
00:21:45.605 --> 00:21:46.906
Valuation?

337
00:21:48.541 --> 00:21:50.242
A million dollars?

338
00:21:50.377 --> 00:21:53.245
Yeah. Bill. the valuation
isn't determined yet.

339
00:21:53.713 --> 00:21:56.082
We don't know what the profit
margins are gonna be.

340
00:21:56.215 --> 00:21:58.951
No. I'm working
on the business plan.

341
00:21:59.552 --> 00:22:01.954
No. I've never started
a business before.

342
00:22:02.822 --> 00:22:04.991
That's the point.
it's called a startup.

343
00:22:05.458 --> 00:22:08.094
How about instead of saying
it's a startup business.

344
00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:13.633
why don't you tell them
it's an investment opportunity?

345
00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:16.803
If you just invest $50.000...

346
00:22:17.604 --> 00:22:21.441
Yeah. Listen. David.
It's going to be big.

347
00:22:21.608 --> 00:22:22.909
We're still working
on the plan.

348
00:22:23.009 --> 00:22:24.276
but-- but we'd love
to invite you

349
00:22:24.444 --> 00:22:25.778
to be one
of the first investors.

350
00:22:25.945 --> 00:22:27.847
What do you mean
I'd make a terrible CEO?

351
00:22:34.954 --> 00:22:36.288
How much is it?

352
00:22:37.624 --> 00:22:38.958
$50.000.

353
00:22:40.927 --> 00:22:42.629
Can't even start
a business with that.

354
00:22:42.762 --> 00:22:44.196
No. that can't be.

355
00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:46.032
we must've called
over 60 people today.

356
00:22:46.165 --> 00:22:47.700
And half of them said no.

357
00:22:50.302 --> 00:22:51.538
Maybe we can get a loan?

358
00:22:52.338 --> 00:22:55.341
No bank is gonna lend us money.
We're a startup.

359
00:22:56.676 --> 00:22:58.010
What do we do. then?

360
00:22:59.278 --> 00:23:00.647
I don't know.

361
00:23:13.893 --> 00:23:15.127
Let's go.

362
00:23:19.198 --> 00:23:23.069
-You sure about this?
-It's our only option.

363
00:23:24.336 --> 00:23:25.705
But it's up to you.

364
00:23:27.707 --> 00:23:29.041
All right.

365
00:23:36.683 --> 00:23:39.385
There you are! Oh!

366
00:23:40.386 --> 00:23:43.355
-Hey. Mom.
-You made it!

367
00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:45.024
Why didn't you give us
some warning?

368
00:23:45.191 --> 00:23:47.193
I-- I would've rolled out
the red carpet.

369
00:23:47.326 --> 00:23:48.861
You know me.
spontaneous to a fault.

370
00:23:48.995 --> 00:23:50.563
Did you hear that?

371
00:23:50.697 --> 00:23:53.700
He's about as spontaneous
as a stopwatch.

372
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.236
Oh. you look exhausted.
Well. come on in. come in.

373
00:23:58.037 --> 00:24:01.040
-Oh. Mike. they're here!
-Oh. my God!

374
00:24:01.207 --> 00:24:03.375
That's my boy. Oh. welcome!

375
00:24:04.544 --> 00:24:07.680
So good to see you!
You look great!

376
00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:09.281
So happy you guys made it.
look at this!

377
00:24:09.415 --> 00:24:10.683
-Hey. Dad.
-Welcome.

378
00:24:10.783 --> 00:24:12.118
This is so great
you guys are here!

379
00:24:12.251 --> 00:24:14.053
Feels so good when you're here.

380
00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:16.055
thank you so much. you guys.
for coming. Gonna be great.

381
00:24:16.222 --> 00:24:17.590
Okay. I've gotta ask.

382
00:24:17.724 --> 00:24:19.058
is he still totally
unorganized?

383
00:24:19.225 --> 00:24:21.227
-Mom!
-Yes.

384
00:24:21.393 --> 00:24:23.763
You know. when he was a kid.
he used to be just like that.

385
00:24:23.896 --> 00:24:25.732
He had so many inventions.
remember. Mike.

386
00:24:25.898 --> 00:24:28.367
up in his room that we finally
had to turn over the garage

387
00:24:28.467 --> 00:24:31.070
-to make it your workshop!
-Thanks. Mom.

388
00:24:31.237 --> 00:24:32.939
Oh. Mike. would you take the
luggage? Take their luggage.

389
00:24:33.072 --> 00:24:35.074
We're gonna have a good time.
we're so happy.

390
00:24:35.241 --> 00:24:36.442
-Thank you. All right.
-Thank you.

391
00:24:36.576 --> 00:24:38.110
So...

392
00:24:41.581 --> 00:24:44.416
-Oh. my gosh. is that you?
-It's me.

393
00:24:44.584 --> 00:24:46.152
MACKENZIE:
That is such a cute photo.

394
00:24:47.253 --> 00:24:49.088
A lot of memories. eh?

395
00:24:49.221 --> 00:24:51.290
Ah! We're so happy
you guys are here.

396
00:24:51.423 --> 00:24:53.259
-Let's sit. sit. come on.
-Let's go.

397
00:24:55.261 --> 00:24:58.965
So. is it happening?
Are we gonna be grandparents?

398
00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.434
-No.
-No.

399
00:25:02.569 --> 00:25:04.470
-Oh!
-Not yet.

400
00:25:04.604 --> 00:25:06.606
This is a great time for you.
you are so busy

401
00:25:06.739 --> 00:25:08.507
and you're doing so many
great things. it's better

402
00:25:08.641 --> 00:25:10.777
to keep working now.
have the kid when you're ready.

403
00:25:10.943 --> 00:25:12.144
How's work?

404
00:25:12.845 --> 00:25:17.483
Actually... we quit our jobs.

405
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:20.286
-You quit?
-Yeah.

406
00:25:20.452 --> 00:25:21.688
Both of you guys?

407
00:25:22.288 --> 00:25:23.656
-Yep.
-Yep.

408
00:25:24.657 --> 00:25:26.425
Did you have a fight
with David?

409
00:25:26.525 --> 00:25:28.460
No. things are fine with David.
you know.

410
00:25:28.628 --> 00:25:30.462
I think he's one
of the smartest people I know.

411
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:32.865
and somebody that uses
both sides of his brain.

412
00:25:32.999 --> 00:25:35.935
But. um. just.
an opportunity came up

413
00:25:36.035 --> 00:25:37.604
that we just couldn't pass up.

414
00:25:37.704 --> 00:25:39.639
So. you got another offer?

415
00:25:40.472 --> 00:25:42.474
No. Mom. um...

416
00:25:43.009 --> 00:25:46.679
We're actually starting
a business online.

417
00:25:46.813 --> 00:25:48.480
On the Internet.
Selling books.

418
00:25:49.148 --> 00:25:50.817
The Internet?

419
00:25:50.983 --> 00:25:53.886
So. the Internet. it's a vast
network of computers

420
00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:57.356
that communicate with each
other and transfer information.

421
00:25:57.489 --> 00:26:01.193
so why couldn't this network
be used to conduct commerce?

422
00:26:01.794 --> 00:26:05.397
And we've identified
the potential

423
00:26:05.531 --> 00:26:09.669
of selling books through
the Internet as a business.

424
00:26:09.836 --> 00:26:11.237
Well. why would you want
to do that?

425
00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:12.972
Why wouldn't you just go
to the store?

426
00:26:13.072 --> 00:26:16.042
A physical store
can never have every book

427
00:26:16.175 --> 00:26:17.977
that ever existed.

428
00:26:18.077 --> 00:26:20.680
And our virtual store could
potentially have every book

429
00:26:20.847 --> 00:26:22.514
and we'll just ship it to you.

430
00:26:23.049 --> 00:26:24.751
Mm-hmm.

431
00:26:24.884 --> 00:26:28.054
And plus. the internet's
growing at 2.300% a year.

432
00:26:28.855 --> 00:26:30.156
Well. how do you know that?

433
00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:33.059
Well. we've found several
analyst reports

434
00:26:33.192 --> 00:26:35.161
and we've been identifying
other businesses

435
00:26:35.261 --> 00:26:37.830
that-- that have seen that kind
of growth and we believe

436
00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:39.732
we can achieve
that selling books.

437
00:26:40.199 --> 00:26:43.102
I don't know. guys. I think
this seems really risky.

438
00:26:43.235 --> 00:26:45.037
Couldn't you. like.
do this on nights

439
00:26:45.171 --> 00:26:47.373
and weekends.
and keep your current job?

440
00:26:49.041 --> 00:26:50.376
No.

441
00:26:50.877 --> 00:26:53.279
Mom. we-- we already
quit our jobs.

442
00:26:53.412 --> 00:26:57.884
And... we'll regret
not trying this business.

443
00:26:58.017 --> 00:26:59.886
That's actually why we're here.

444
00:27:00.019 --> 00:27:04.256
We were hoping that you both
would consider investing.

445
00:27:07.059 --> 00:27:08.360
How much do you need?

446
00:27:09.028 --> 00:27:10.396
Couple hundred thousand.

447
00:27:15.567 --> 00:27:17.737
Three hundred would be great.

448
00:27:19.238 --> 00:27:22.709
You each would get a couple
percentage points and ownership

449
00:27:22.809 --> 00:27:25.077
in the business and.
if it's successful.

450
00:27:25.244 --> 00:27:27.246
it could be millions
of dollars for you.

451
00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:32.985
But I have to warn you. there's
a 70% chance it could fail.

452
00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:37.824
I mean. that's the majority

453
00:27:37.957 --> 00:27:39.759
of our retirement fund. honey.

454
00:27:39.926 --> 00:27:41.160
When do you need it by?

455
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:46.165
Tomorrow.

456
00:27:46.733 --> 00:27:48.768
Well. I've got an idea.

457
00:27:48.935 --> 00:27:50.770
Dinner's almost ready.

458
00:27:51.237 --> 00:27:53.105
Why don't we have a nice dinner

459
00:27:53.239 --> 00:27:55.842
and we can just talk
about this later?

460
00:28:45.825 --> 00:28:47.493
-You're up early.
-Yeah.

461
00:28:50.196 --> 00:28:51.998
I just wanna tell you.

462
00:28:52.131 --> 00:28:54.500
I don't invest in you
and I hope you understand that.

463
00:29:03.175 --> 00:29:04.376
Why?

464
00:29:05.044 --> 00:29:06.846
You know. it's an idea
that you have to understand.

465
00:29:06.979 --> 00:29:08.380
it takes
a lot of planning.

466
00:29:08.514 --> 00:29:11.050
a lot of things.
and we don't have a lot.

467
00:29:11.717 --> 00:29:13.052
But I'm not gonna tell you.

468
00:29:13.185 --> 00:29:15.054
you know how much
you represent to me.

469
00:29:15.187 --> 00:29:17.389
And I just want to tell you
something.

470
00:29:17.523 --> 00:29:19.591
We live in a free country.
I believe in America

471
00:29:19.725 --> 00:29:21.894
that every dreams
can come true.

472
00:29:22.028 --> 00:29:24.763
And the main thing that I want
you to know...

473
00:29:26.065 --> 00:29:27.433
that I believe in you.

474
00:29:27.566 --> 00:29:28.767
So. I'm going
to give you something.

475
00:29:28.901 --> 00:29:30.202
These are life savings.

476
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:33.840
Thanks. Dad.

477
00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:35.875
-I love you.
-I love you.

478
00:29:42.214 --> 00:29:43.682
I won't let you down.

479
00:29:43.782 --> 00:29:46.252
I know that.
Absolutely. I know that.

480
00:29:53.059 --> 00:29:54.726
Can I ask you
for another favor?

481
00:29:54.894 --> 00:29:56.728
Another favor now?

482
00:29:57.229 --> 00:29:59.131
Can I borrow the truck?

483
00:29:59.265 --> 00:30:01.067
Oh. my God.
you gonna kill me.

484
00:30:01.233 --> 00:30:03.069
Your mom is gonna kill me. too.
because you know that--

485
00:30:03.235 --> 00:30:05.104
Go ahead. enjoy yourself.
Today's a big day.

486
00:30:16.415 --> 00:30:17.783
So. where are we heading?

487
00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:20.552
Just keep heading west. babe.

488
00:30:22.254 --> 00:30:23.755
Okay.

489
00:30:25.591 --> 00:30:28.928
-I'll figure it out soon.
-I mean. take your time.

490
00:30:29.095 --> 00:30:31.297
The movers are only.
I don't know.

491
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:33.099
18 hours behind us.
I don't--

492
00:30:33.265 --> 00:30:35.567
I'm sure they don't mind
driving aimlessly.

493
00:30:36.768 --> 00:30:38.270
It's probably not
the first time they do.

494
00:30:45.111 --> 00:30:46.612
You sure
we're at the right place?

495
00:30:47.113 --> 00:30:48.747
Um. you picked it.

496
00:30:55.955 --> 00:30:57.789
Thank you.

497
00:31:15.674 --> 00:31:17.809
I think I figured out
where we're going.

498
00:31:18.644 --> 00:31:22.114
Oh. I'm really starting
to like the nomad life. though.

499
00:31:22.214 --> 00:31:24.650
Well. normally.
an analysis like this

500
00:31:24.816 --> 00:31:27.053
would take several months.
but since we have 24 hours

501
00:31:27.186 --> 00:31:28.620
to notify the movers.

502
00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.289
I've narrowed it down
to one city.

503
00:31:30.889 --> 00:31:33.192
It's a city
with a favorable tax structure.

504
00:31:33.325 --> 00:31:36.662
a reasonable cost of living.
a highly qualified workforce.

505
00:31:36.828 --> 00:31:38.330
and access to ports.

506
00:31:38.864 --> 00:31:40.166
Ports?

507
00:31:40.699 --> 00:31:42.868
'Cause we'll be getting
so many books from Asia?

508
00:31:43.002 --> 00:31:46.805
You never know.
So. drumroll. please.

509
00:31:49.508 --> 00:31:52.144
We're moving to...
Seattle. Washington.

510
00:31:55.681 --> 00:31:57.916
-Hmm.
-You're not excited.

511
00:31:58.684 --> 00:32:02.921
I mean. the coffee's good.
right?

512
00:32:03.055 --> 00:32:04.690
There's more than just
coffee in Seattle.

513
00:32:07.059 --> 00:32:08.594
I better call the movers.

514
00:32:08.727 --> 00:32:10.762
Yeah. they're gonna need
an actual address.

515
00:32:10.896 --> 00:32:13.032
At least they know
where to point the truck now.

516
00:32:50.136 --> 00:32:51.637
I wanna show you something.

517
00:33:09.055 --> 00:33:10.989
You're about to see
something beautiful.

518
00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:18.930
-It's beautiful.
-Yeah. Cadabra.

519
00:33:21.767 --> 00:33:24.170
-What?
-Cadabra.

520
00:33:24.936 --> 00:33:26.272
That's the name of our company.

521
00:33:28.774 --> 00:33:30.342
Like magic.

522
00:33:43.955 --> 00:33:46.292
So. you're sure
he's gonna do it for a price?

523
00:33:47.193 --> 00:33:48.494
Excellent.

524
00:33:49.195 --> 00:33:51.163
He's a divorce lawyer.
of course!

525
00:33:53.199 --> 00:33:55.334
How exactly is opening
a corporation

526
00:33:55.467 --> 00:33:56.702
like dissolving a marriage?

527
00:33:57.303 --> 00:33:59.171
All right. thank you.

528
00:33:59.305 --> 00:34:01.540
Great. so you'll have a draft
for us by Wednesday.

529
00:34:02.474 --> 00:34:04.810
I'll send you my address
in Seattle once we get there.

530
00:34:05.644 --> 00:34:08.547
Yeah. Cadabra. Inc.

531
00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:11.883
Like Abra Cadabra. Yeah.

532
00:34:12.618 --> 00:34:15.821
No. no. Not a cadaver.
Cadabra.

533
00:34:17.189 --> 00:34:21.360
Yep. No. no. we're not selling
any magic supplies. just books.

534
00:34:22.461 --> 00:34:23.695
Thank you.

535
00:34:28.667 --> 00:34:32.504
Hey. Shel.
How are you? Jeff Bezos.

536
00:34:32.671 --> 00:34:35.474
Yep. Peter Leventhal's friend.

537
00:34:37.509 --> 00:34:39.411
So. we're heading your way.

538
00:34:39.545 --> 00:34:41.147
wanted to see
if you're available tomorrow.

539
00:34:41.247 --> 00:34:43.482
Get some breakfast
and we can talk about a job.

540
00:34:44.916 --> 00:34:47.653
Yep.
San Francisco. perfect.

541
00:34:47.753 --> 00:34:49.488
All right.
Call you in the morning.

542
00:35:00.866 --> 00:35:02.534
GRANDPA:
Okay. here we go. Jeff.

543
00:35:02.701 --> 00:35:05.704
Uh. with your left hand
take the nail like this.

544
00:35:06.905 --> 00:35:09.608
and with your right hand hold
the hammer like that. okay?

545
00:35:09.741 --> 00:35:11.877
Hold it. hold it
with strength. okay?

546
00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:16.548
And then subtly tap on the nail
to seed it in place.

547
00:35:16.682 --> 00:35:19.851
And then when you're ready.
hit it a little harder.

548
00:35:20.419 --> 00:35:24.290
Then take your left hand away
and give it a whack.

549
00:35:24.423 --> 00:35:26.892
-Okay.
-Okay? Try that.

550
00:35:34.233 --> 00:35:36.535
-Did I do it good!
-Yeah. you did it!

551
00:35:36.635 --> 00:35:40.239
All right. drink up!
You boys need to stay hydrated.

552
00:35:40.406 --> 00:35:41.707
Oh. yeah.

553
00:35:44.109 --> 00:35:45.311
Thanks. Grandma.

554
00:35:45.444 --> 00:35:47.145
Supper's ready in 30 minutes.

555
00:35:47.279 --> 00:35:48.980
Go inside and get cleaned up.

556
00:35:49.114 --> 00:35:51.783
I'm making grandpa's
special dish today.

557
00:35:51.917 --> 00:35:53.252
Mm.

558
00:35:54.653 --> 00:35:56.322
You know. you always
wanna have great people

559
00:35:56.455 --> 00:35:57.756
in your life. Jeff.

560
00:35:59.758 --> 00:36:01.593
It's the one way to stay happy.

561
00:36:07.233 --> 00:36:09.134
But make sure
it has at least three bedrooms

562
00:36:09.268 --> 00:36:11.136
and an attached garage.

563
00:36:11.937 --> 00:36:13.605
May I ask why?

564
00:36:13.772 --> 00:36:15.307
I want us to be like

565
00:36:15.441 --> 00:36:17.676
all the great American
suburb stories.

566
00:36:17.809 --> 00:36:19.945
Apple. Dell. Disney.

567
00:36:20.479 --> 00:36:22.614
They all started in a garage.

568
00:36:23.148 --> 00:36:25.016
-You serious?
-Yeah.

569
00:36:25.951 --> 00:36:27.619
But no more than 800 a month.

570
00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:31.690
-Seems like kind of a lot.
-Seven hundred.

571
00:36:32.424 --> 00:36:34.660
And we need the keys tomorrow.

572
00:36:35.794 --> 00:36:37.363
I think the movers are
in Nebraska already.

573
00:36:37.496 --> 00:36:38.797
Okay.

574
00:36:39.331 --> 00:36:40.632
Oh. he's here.

575
00:36:43.635 --> 00:36:44.936
Hi. Shel.

576
00:36:47.038 --> 00:36:48.874
Jeff. My wife. MacKenzie.

577
00:36:49.007 --> 00:36:50.609
MacKenzie. Nice to meet you.

578
00:36:50.709 --> 00:36:52.778
-I'll leave you to it.
-Great.

579
00:36:52.878 --> 00:36:54.946
So. Paul speaks
very highly of you.

580
00:36:55.046 --> 00:36:56.515
Said he doesn't know anybody
that can build

581
00:36:56.648 --> 00:36:58.284
a database as fast as you.

582
00:36:58.384 --> 00:37:00.386
Yeah. I was part of the team
that wrote script decks.

583
00:37:00.519 --> 00:37:02.354
-Oh. impressive stuff.
-It was.

584
00:37:02.488 --> 00:37:05.524
You were also part of the whole
Earth catalogue. correct?

585
00:37:05.657 --> 00:37:07.058
-Indeed.
-Yeah. great.

586
00:37:07.192 --> 00:37:08.560
-You want a coffee?
-Sure.

587
00:37:09.127 --> 00:37:11.062
I'll have a large coffee
and whatever he's having.

588
00:37:11.196 --> 00:37:13.031
Cappuccino.

589
00:37:13.164 --> 00:37:16.201
I'll pay 'cause we actually
have startup capital.

590
00:37:16.335 --> 00:37:18.870
It's from my parents.
don't be overly impressed.

591
00:37:19.004 --> 00:37:20.506
Here.

592
00:37:28.179 --> 00:37:30.015
This is the whole
business plan?

593
00:37:30.148 --> 00:37:33.084
Mm. no. just what I was able
to get done

594
00:37:33.218 --> 00:37:35.186
between Fort Worth and now.

595
00:37:35.321 --> 00:37:37.723
Um. I'll have the rest done
by the time we get to Seattle.

596
00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:41.660
-Books. huh? Nothing else?
-That's it.

597
00:37:43.895 --> 00:37:45.564
You got a name yet?

598
00:37:46.064 --> 00:37:49.868
-Cadabra.
-Cadaver? Like a dead body?

599
00:37:50.035 --> 00:37:53.104
No. Cadabra.
Like a magic trick.

600
00:37:53.872 --> 00:37:55.206
That's much better.

601
00:37:55.774 --> 00:37:58.009
Now.
based on your qualifications.

602
00:37:58.109 --> 00:38:00.612
why are you perfect
for this programming job?

603
00:38:01.713 --> 00:38:04.350
I was under the impression
you were pitching me a job.

604
00:38:06.051 --> 00:38:07.586
-Yeah. but--
-I didn't drive all the way up

605
00:38:07.719 --> 00:38:09.721
from Santa Cruz
to be interviewed.

606
00:38:11.022 --> 00:38:13.392
-I kinda thought it'd be both.
-It's not.

607
00:38:13.525 --> 00:38:15.126
You'd be very lucky to have me.

608
00:38:16.227 --> 00:38:17.563
Probably right.

609
00:38:17.696 --> 00:38:19.297
-I am.
-Fine.

610
00:38:19.431 --> 00:38:21.066
The job is yours
if you want it.

611
00:38:21.199 --> 00:38:22.768
I commend your good judgement.

612
00:38:22.901 --> 00:38:25.270
Now. I must warn you.
the pay is shit.

613
00:38:25.404 --> 00:38:27.238
you will be working
barbaric hours.

614
00:38:27.406 --> 00:38:29.274
but you will receive
some stock options

615
00:38:29.408 --> 00:38:30.909
and it will be
the most difficult project

616
00:38:31.042 --> 00:38:32.444
you've ever worked on.

617
00:38:33.879 --> 00:38:35.947
You know. most tech startups
never make it.

618
00:38:36.415 --> 00:38:38.083
See. in the book business.

619
00:38:38.216 --> 00:38:39.918
there's a huge disparity
between supply and demand

620
00:38:40.085 --> 00:38:41.753
and it's virtually impossible

621
00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:44.790
for a physical bookstore
to carry millions of books.

622
00:38:45.457 --> 00:38:48.660
So. if you're able to build us
a website that can handle

623
00:38:48.794 --> 00:38:52.764
a product category that large.
we will be successful.

624
00:38:53.599 --> 00:38:54.833
Welcome aboard.

625
00:38:58.437 --> 00:39:00.672
Okay. yeah.
Yeah. those dates are perfect.

626
00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:04.109
Amazing. Yeah. great.

627
00:39:04.275 --> 00:39:06.011
Thank you so much.
I'll call you when we arrive.

628
00:39:06.144 --> 00:39:07.446
Okay.

629
00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:10.949
-He's in.
-Well. that was easy.

630
00:39:11.817 --> 00:39:13.452
How'd it go on your end?

631
00:39:13.619 --> 00:39:15.120
You're not the only one
having success.

632
00:39:15.253 --> 00:39:17.989
-Oh!
-Our new home.

633
00:39:20.926 --> 00:39:22.461
Perfect.

634
00:39:28.634 --> 00:39:29.968
-Pleasure.
-Thank you.

635
00:39:34.305 --> 00:39:35.841
Yeah.

636
00:39:51.523 --> 00:39:53.391
Maybe we should've seen it
first before renting.

637
00:39:53.525 --> 00:39:54.826
It's perfect.

638
00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:06.472
That's gotta go.

639
00:40:21.219 --> 00:40:22.521
What do you think?

640
00:40:24.155 --> 00:40:25.691
Potential at best.

641
00:40:26.725 --> 00:40:28.193
Everything we need's
right here.

642
00:40:32.864 --> 00:40:34.265
Whoa! Whoa. whoa. whoa!

643
00:40:45.043 --> 00:40:48.046
We came all the way
from New York for this?

644
00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:50.281
Yeah. this is our new offices.

645
00:40:50.882 --> 00:40:52.183
Got it.

646
00:42:07.458 --> 00:42:08.694
Hey. look who's here!

647
00:42:08.827 --> 00:42:10.762
-Hey. Paul!
-Jeff!

648
00:42:10.862 --> 00:42:13.264
Good to see you.
Paul. meet Shel.

649
00:42:13.364 --> 00:42:14.866
Your reputation precedes you.

650
00:42:15.333 --> 00:42:17.636
-Same.
-How was the farewell party?

651
00:42:17.769 --> 00:42:19.971
I'm a bit hungover.
honestly.

652
00:42:20.105 --> 00:42:21.673
They threw me quite
the sendoff.

653
00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:23.942
Even gave me a lovely gift.

654
00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:27.979
They're a bit skeptical of
Cadabra's chances of success.

655
00:42:28.146 --> 00:42:30.148
so they took up a collection
to tide me over

656
00:42:30.315 --> 00:42:31.482
while I look for work.

657
00:42:33.151 --> 00:42:36.487
-Almost $27.
-Wanna buy some shares?

658
00:42:37.122 --> 00:42:38.824
Mind if I take a peek
at the books first?

659
00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:40.826
Come on.
let me show you your new home.

660
00:42:43.461 --> 00:42:45.563
I just finished setting up
the new computer system.

661
00:42:45.697 --> 00:42:47.165
I went with
high-powered servers.

662
00:42:47.332 --> 00:42:48.867
Splendid.

663
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.501
Only problem is
they draw so much power.

664
00:42:50.669 --> 00:42:52.403
I had to run each one
off a different circuit.

665
00:42:53.004 --> 00:42:54.405
They work great.

666
00:42:54.539 --> 00:42:56.474
so long as you don't plug
anything else in.

667
00:42:59.678 --> 00:43:02.147
Shit. Gimme a second.

668
00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:07.853
-MacKenzie.
-Yes?

669
00:43:08.019 --> 00:43:11.056
-What're you doing?
-Drying my hair!

670
00:43:11.189 --> 00:43:15.026
I told you. don't plug anything
in while we're working.

671
00:43:15.526 --> 00:43:17.195
Well.
what am I supposed to do. then?

672
00:43:17.362 --> 00:43:19.364
Don't plug in any appliances!

673
00:43:19.898 --> 00:43:22.600
Sorry. guys.

674
00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:27.538
All right. guys.
Got some stuff

675
00:43:27.673 --> 00:43:29.708
I want to share with you.
Let me get my notes.

676
00:43:29.841 --> 00:43:31.609
I thought
he came from finance?

677
00:43:31.743 --> 00:43:33.544
Is he a programmer. too?

678
00:43:34.012 --> 00:43:36.614
He majored in computer
science at Princeton.

679
00:43:36.748 --> 00:43:38.549
Oh. dear.

680
00:43:38.684 --> 00:43:40.551
So. I've gone ahead
and analyzed every software

681
00:43:40.719 --> 00:43:42.453
in the marketplace and.
unfortunately.

682
00:43:42.587 --> 00:43:44.555
most of 'em were built
for a mail order system.

683
00:43:44.723 --> 00:43:46.892
The customer places the order.
the order's processed.

684
00:43:47.025 --> 00:43:48.593
and then the inventory's
updated

685
00:43:49.094 --> 00:43:51.562
with three typical product
availabilities: in stock.

686
00:43:51.730 --> 00:43:53.364
out of stock. and unavailable.

687
00:43:53.464 --> 00:43:56.201
Our website's gonna
have seven of them:

688
00:43:56.968 --> 00:43:58.603
shipped within 24 hours.

689
00:43:58.737 --> 00:44:00.205
shipped within two
to three days.

690
00:44:00.305 --> 00:44:01.707
shipped within one
to two weeks.

691
00:44:01.807 --> 00:44:03.374
shipped within four
to six weeks.

692
00:44:03.474 --> 00:44:05.877
not yet published.
out of stock.

693
00:44:05.977 --> 00:44:08.714
and. for hard to find titles.
shipped within three months.

694
00:44:09.948 --> 00:44:11.316
So. what does this all mean?

695
00:44:11.449 --> 00:44:12.818
Indeed.

696
00:44:13.484 --> 00:44:15.120
We need to build
our own software.

697
00:44:15.253 --> 00:44:17.055
So. we're going open source?

698
00:44:17.155 --> 00:44:18.589
We don't have a choice.

699
00:44:18.757 --> 00:44:20.425
You see.
we don't have the finances

700
00:44:20.591 --> 00:44:22.593
to hire a bunch of programmers
to build this for us.

701
00:44:22.728 --> 00:44:24.595
So. we're gonna count
on thousands of programmers

702
00:44:24.763 --> 00:44:28.433
around the world to build it
for us and update it for us.

703
00:44:28.566 --> 00:44:31.669
which is gonna allow us to
focus on what really matters.

704
00:44:32.904 --> 00:44:35.774
Selling books.
Make sense?

705
00:44:36.274 --> 00:44:38.476
So. if we're gonna build
the world's greatest bookstore.

706
00:44:38.609 --> 00:44:40.478
we're gonna need
the world's greatest website.

707
00:44:41.246 --> 00:44:42.480
Let's get to it.

708
00:44:43.982 --> 00:44:45.951
-Jeff.
-Yeah?

709
00:44:46.117 --> 00:44:47.685
I feel the need
to remind you that.

710
00:44:47.819 --> 00:44:49.955
given all the things
you want the site to do.

711
00:44:50.121 --> 00:44:52.357
no one's ever built anything
even remotely like it before.

712
00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:54.159
Exactly.

713
00:44:54.292 --> 00:44:56.494
While we're attempting
the impossible.

714
00:44:56.627 --> 00:44:58.363
what will you be doing?

715
00:44:58.496 --> 00:45:00.698
Attempting the improbable.

716
00:45:00.832 --> 00:45:02.533
I need to raise
a million dollars

717
00:45:02.667 --> 00:45:04.469
if we're gonna get this website
live by summer.

718
00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:08.473
If you're serious about
this timeline. we'll need help.

719
00:45:08.639 --> 00:45:10.541
Fine. Put an ad out.

720
00:45:10.675 --> 00:45:12.010
Which reminds me...

721
00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:18.016
Never again
will we be referred

722
00:45:18.149 --> 00:45:19.985
to as the website
that sells dead bodies.

723
00:45:20.151 --> 00:45:22.287
Cadabra.com is defunct.

724
00:45:26.291 --> 00:45:28.693
Our new name is--
Drumroll...

725
00:45:33.198 --> 00:45:35.200
Relentless.com.

726
00:45:41.506 --> 00:45:44.042
Nick. it's Jeff.
How are you?

727
00:45:44.675 --> 00:45:47.712
You signed the contract.
you said you were sending

728
00:45:47.846 --> 00:45:50.348
the check. and then you put
a stop payment on the check.

729
00:45:50.481 --> 00:45:52.583
Do you understand
how that affects our company?

730
00:45:52.717 --> 00:45:55.020
What do you mean you don't
understand what we're doing?

731
00:45:55.186 --> 00:45:57.655
Yeah. I'm just following up
on that investment

732
00:45:57.755 --> 00:45:59.357
you committed to.

733
00:45:59.524 --> 00:46:01.860
A lot of great companies
have started in a garage.

734
00:46:02.027 --> 00:46:04.362
Apple. Microsoft.

735
00:46:04.529 --> 00:46:06.164
Um. yep.

736
00:46:06.264 --> 00:46:08.699
The company's still going.
but we really need you

737
00:46:08.867 --> 00:46:10.535
to send us the money.
if you can.

738
00:46:10.701 --> 00:46:13.704
It's a virtual Internet store.

739
00:46:14.205 --> 00:46:16.007
There's no physical location.

740
00:46:16.107 --> 00:46:18.176
That's not our business model.

741
00:46:18.276 --> 00:46:20.211
If you're not interested.
just tell me.

742
00:46:20.378 --> 00:46:23.214
We're selling books.

743
00:46:23.714 --> 00:46:25.917
I don't care
if you changed your mind.

744
00:46:26.051 --> 00:46:27.385
if you make commitments.

745
00:46:27.552 --> 00:46:28.887
you gotta
follow through in life.

746
00:46:29.054 --> 00:46:30.956
You can't have
two million products

747
00:46:31.089 --> 00:46:33.391
inside of a bookstore!

748
00:46:33.524 --> 00:46:35.060
You think we're gonna fail?

749
00:46:35.693 --> 00:46:37.295
Well. I think
you're gonna fail.

750
00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:37.188
It's still a little bit
too confusing.

751
00:47:37.956 --> 00:47:39.958
What do you mean?
It's a standard landing page.

752
00:47:40.125 --> 00:47:42.193
You need to imagine that all
of our customers have never

753
00:47:42.327 --> 00:47:43.661
used a computer before.

754
00:47:44.162 --> 00:47:47.865
The homepage has to be very...
user-friendly.

755
00:47:47.999 --> 00:47:50.035
I can't work
on this change tonight.

756
00:47:50.168 --> 00:47:51.869
-I'll work on it tomorrow.
-No. no.

757
00:47:52.003 --> 00:47:53.804
Let's get it done now
while the ideas are fresh.

758
00:47:53.939 --> 00:47:55.473
Jeff. with all due respect.

759
00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:57.375
we've been at this
for 12 hours straight.

760
00:47:57.508 --> 00:47:59.310
And there's 24 hours
in the day. Shel.

761
00:47:59.477 --> 00:48:02.847
I'll redraft it.
And burn the midnight oil.

762
00:48:04.215 --> 00:48:06.517
Jeff?

763
00:48:06.651 --> 00:48:09.387
-One second.
-Jeff.

764
00:48:10.021 --> 00:48:11.822
One second. MacKenzie.

765
00:48:17.695 --> 00:48:19.130
Is it important?

766
00:48:20.331 --> 00:48:24.169
-No. It's fine.
-I'll be up in a bit.

767
00:48:24.335 --> 00:48:26.071
What's a bit?

768
00:48:26.204 --> 00:48:27.505
I don't know!

769
00:48:33.878 --> 00:48:35.346
Goodnight. fellas.

770
00:48:36.514 --> 00:48:38.049
PAUL & SHEL: Night.

771
00:50:10.475 --> 00:50:13.178
-Thank you so much.
-Do you have your receipt?

772
00:50:13.311 --> 00:50:15.613
-Hi. your name?
-Vazquez.

773
00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:19.484
-Hello. How are you?
-Thank you.

774
00:50:19.617 --> 00:50:21.519
-Thank you for attending.
-Of course.

775
00:50:21.652 --> 00:50:23.688
-Hi. your name?
-Hi. Bezos.

776
00:50:23.821 --> 00:50:25.456
Bezos.

777
00:50:25.623 --> 00:50:28.359
-Here.
-Thank you.

778
00:50:28.493 --> 00:50:30.628
Thank you. Hi.

779
00:50:30.795 --> 00:50:33.298
-Okay. okay.

780
00:50:33.464 --> 00:50:36.134
Now it's time
for you brave souls

781
00:50:36.801 --> 00:50:40.805
to stand up and tell us
about yourselves.

782
00:50:41.306 --> 00:50:44.008
Who you are.
your hopes and dreams.

783
00:50:45.976 --> 00:50:47.312
Who's gonna go first?

784
00:50:48.779 --> 00:50:51.216
-Okay.
-Okay. Hi.

785
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:54.152
Hi. I'm Molly Jean Andrews

786
00:50:54.285 --> 00:50:57.188
and I'm from
Green Valley. Arizona.

787
00:50:57.322 --> 00:51:01.159
and I'm opening up a little
shop called Kitchen Bible.

788
00:51:01.326 --> 00:51:03.661
And I have a few cookies.
Do you wanna try one?

789
00:51:03.828 --> 00:51:05.663
All right. Um. you know.

790
00:51:05.796 --> 00:51:07.498
there's gonna be nothing
but cookbooks.

791
00:51:07.665 --> 00:51:09.634
I'm not looking to get rich
or anything.

792
00:51:09.734 --> 00:51:12.002
I just don't wanna lose
my shirt either.

793
00:51:16.841 --> 00:51:21.246
Hello. I'm Charles Allen Morrow
from Highland Park. Illinois.

794
00:51:21.746 --> 00:51:26.050
My shop. Marrow's Antiquaria.
opening in August.

795
00:51:26.184 --> 00:51:29.254
is going to be specializing
in rare books

796
00:51:29.387 --> 00:51:31.856
and autographs in all fields.

797
00:51:32.022 --> 00:51:34.992
-Okay. anybody else?

798
00:51:35.893 --> 00:51:37.195
Oh. please!

799
00:51:38.028 --> 00:51:39.864
Hi. How are you?

800
00:51:39.997 --> 00:51:42.900
Um. my name is Jeff. Jeff Bezos
from Seattle. Washington.

801
00:51:43.033 --> 00:51:45.603
and I'm mainly here to learn
more about the book business

802
00:51:45.736 --> 00:51:48.239
because this summer
we'll be launching

803
00:51:48.373 --> 00:51:51.376
the world's largest bookstore.
relentless.com.

804
00:51:53.378 --> 00:51:54.712
A bit overzealous
for a bookstore.

805
00:51:54.845 --> 00:51:56.214
Don't you think?

806
00:51:56.381 --> 00:51:58.449
Well. I can--
I can explain. actually.

807
00:51:58.583 --> 00:52:01.252
The reason why it'll be
the world's largest bookstore

808
00:52:01.386 --> 00:52:03.388
is because its vast library

809
00:52:03.554 --> 00:52:06.257
is gonna exist exclusively
on the Internet.

810
00:52:07.258 --> 00:52:10.528
-Okay. well...

811
00:52:11.396 --> 00:52:13.731
Let's move on
to the other topics. then.

812
00:52:16.267 --> 00:52:18.035
Um. excuse me one second.

813
00:52:18.135 --> 00:52:20.938
-Hey. Internet guy.
-Who. me?

814
00:52:21.071 --> 00:52:23.308
-Yes. you.
-Hi. how're you doing. sir?

815
00:52:23.441 --> 00:52:25.810
-Do you know who I am?
-Of course. Mr. Leonard Riggio.

816
00:52:25.943 --> 00:52:28.145
-And you are?
-Jeff. Jeff Bezos.

817
00:52:30.114 --> 00:52:31.549
Care to have a drink with me.
Jeff?

818
00:52:37.255 --> 00:52:39.290
See. since books
are a true commodity.

819
00:52:39.424 --> 00:52:41.926
it seemed like the ideal
first product to sell online.

820
00:52:42.059 --> 00:52:43.928
being that books
in every physical--

821
00:52:44.094 --> 00:52:45.796
-Can I get you anything else?
-We're fine.

822
00:52:46.431 --> 00:52:49.099
Books in all your physical
locations are identical.

823
00:52:49.234 --> 00:52:50.835
So. customers
should be comfortable

824
00:52:50.968 --> 00:52:52.470
purchasing them online.

825
00:52:53.103 --> 00:52:56.307
Hmm. Seems like an interesting
idea you have there.

826
00:52:56.441 --> 00:52:58.943
Well. it's more
than just an idea.

827
00:52:59.109 --> 00:53:01.346
-Is it. though?
-Yeah.

828
00:53:01.479 --> 00:53:03.113
I mean. we have programmers
working on it now.

829
00:53:03.248 --> 00:53:04.782
we'll be live this summer.

830
00:53:04.915 --> 00:53:06.984
But until it actually
comes to fruition.

831
00:53:07.117 --> 00:53:09.620
and more than anything.
actually proves to be viable.

832
00:53:09.787 --> 00:53:11.622
it's... just an idea.

833
00:53:11.789 --> 00:53:13.591
What did you say
you're calling it again?

834
00:53:13.691 --> 00:53:14.959
Relentless.

835
00:53:15.626 --> 00:53:17.928
Huh. Peculiar name.

836
00:53:19.163 --> 00:53:21.131
Doesn't quite fit the book
industry. though. does it?

837
00:53:21.299 --> 00:53:22.500
How so?

838
00:53:23.133 --> 00:53:25.836
"Relentless."
I mean. it's aggressive.

839
00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:27.372
You're trying
to lure bookworms in.

840
00:53:27.505 --> 00:53:29.173
you're not trying
to ready them for battle.

841
00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:31.175
See. I never looked
at it that way.

842
00:53:31.309 --> 00:53:33.010
I always thought
our competitors

843
00:53:33.143 --> 00:53:35.646
would see us a certain way.
not-- not the consumer.

844
00:53:35.813 --> 00:53:38.048
And that right there is why
Relentless will never be

845
00:53:38.182 --> 00:53:39.984
anything more
than just an idea.

846
00:53:40.485 --> 00:53:43.220
But. you see.
we're open to an investment

847
00:53:43.354 --> 00:53:45.656
and maybe a partnership
with Barnes & Noble

848
00:53:45.823 --> 00:53:47.558
where we are your Internet
fulfillment wing.

849
00:53:47.692 --> 00:53:50.194
No. I-- I'm sorry. James.

850
00:53:50.328 --> 00:53:53.163
-Uh. Jeff.
-Right. Jeff. uh...

851
00:53:53.831 --> 00:53:55.366
We don't do that.

852
00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:57.335
You see.
we're not just gonna be

853
00:53:57.468 --> 00:53:59.003
another independent bookseller.

854
00:53:59.136 --> 00:54:00.905
Okay. Stop right there.

855
00:54:01.038 --> 00:54:03.508
Right. Do you-- Do you know
who you're speaking to?

856
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:06.243
-Of course.
-But do you really?

857
00:54:06.377 --> 00:54:07.678
Because I'm not
just Leonard Riggio.

858
00:54:07.845 --> 00:54:09.914
I am Barnes & Noble. Inc.

859
00:54:10.047 --> 00:54:13.083
Biggest book retailer in
the entire industry. all right?

860
00:54:13.217 --> 00:54:15.420
And we just had an 87%
gain in revenue

861
00:54:15.553 --> 00:54:16.821
over the last quarter alone.

862
00:54:16.921 --> 00:54:18.389
I'm well aware of your success.

863
00:54:18.523 --> 00:54:20.325
Oh. well. then
you should also be aware

864
00:54:20.425 --> 00:54:22.192
that we're about to open
100 more stores this year.

865
00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:24.094
And then it's only a matter
of time before

866
00:54:24.228 --> 00:54:26.764
independent booksellers such
as yourself become obsolete.

867
00:54:26.897 --> 00:54:29.199
I have no interest
in investing in anything

868
00:54:29.367 --> 00:54:31.201
other than my own company.

869
00:54:31.936 --> 00:54:34.004
But it's more about the future.

870
00:54:34.104 --> 00:54:35.706
Would you like some advice?

871
00:54:35.873 --> 00:54:38.008
-It's Jeff. right?
-Yeah.

872
00:54:38.108 --> 00:54:40.277
Um. I think you should go find
another business

873
00:54:40.411 --> 00:54:41.946
to look at.

874
00:54:42.079 --> 00:54:43.681
Take whatever money you have
and put it into

875
00:54:43.781 --> 00:54:45.616
the manufacturing
sector or something.

876
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:48.118
I-- It's-- You know. they're
having a lot of growth lately.

877
00:54:48.252 --> 00:54:50.721
But you will never find
success in the book industry.

878
00:54:50.855 --> 00:54:52.557
I can guarantee you that.

879
00:54:53.057 --> 00:54:56.060
I'd like to say that
it was good chatting with you.

880
00:54:56.193 --> 00:54:58.028
but. frankly.
it was a waste of time.

881
00:54:58.696 --> 00:55:01.231
That is for the drinks.

882
00:55:01.732 --> 00:55:03.434
And whatever is leftover.
you can consider

883
00:55:03.568 --> 00:55:05.470
it seed money
for a new business venture.

884
00:55:58.789 --> 00:56:00.791
MACKENZIE:
You don't have to be quiet.

885
00:56:00.925 --> 00:56:02.159
I waited up.

886
00:56:06.464 --> 00:56:09.133
-How'd it go?

887
00:56:11.301 --> 00:56:13.638
-Terrible.
-Why? What happened?

888
00:56:13.804 --> 00:56:15.473
I don't wanna talk about it.

889
00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:18.308
Oh. come on.
I'm just asking about your day.

890
00:56:18.976 --> 00:56:21.278
MacKenzie.
I don't wanna talk about it.

891
00:56:23.514 --> 00:56:25.049
It was a complete waste
of time.

892
00:56:25.182 --> 00:56:26.617
Nobody's interested
in our company.

893
00:56:26.717 --> 00:56:28.118
Is that what you wanna hear?

894
00:56:33.658 --> 00:56:35.159
Is this how it's gonna be
from now on?

895
00:56:35.325 --> 00:56:36.794
Like what?

896
00:56:38.496 --> 00:56:40.831
-Like what?
-Like this!

897
00:56:40.998 --> 00:56:43.333
We barely talk. and when
we do talk. you just yell.

898
00:56:43.868 --> 00:56:45.736
-I'm not yelling.
-Yes. you are!

899
00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:47.538
You're yelling.

900
00:56:47.672 --> 00:56:49.540
No. ever since we got here
I can't talk to you

901
00:56:49.674 --> 00:56:52.176
without you getting upset
at me or telling me to shut up.

902
00:56:52.342 --> 00:56:54.579
In case you haven't realized.
I have a company

903
00:56:54.712 --> 00:56:56.547
that I'm trying to get off
the ground.

904
00:56:57.147 --> 00:56:59.584
So. excuse me if I don't
give you 100% of my attention--

905
00:56:59.717 --> 00:57:01.586
I don't want 100%
of your attention.

906
00:57:01.719 --> 00:57:03.721
I just want a fraction of it.

907
00:57:07.658 --> 00:57:09.026
Please.

908
00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:15.199
This is my life. MacKenzie.

909
00:57:15.332 --> 00:57:17.568
and I have everything
in the world invested

910
00:57:17.702 --> 00:57:20.270
in this business
and I will not fail.

911
00:57:20.404 --> 00:57:23.841
I will work 24 hours a day
to make sure that I succeed.

912
00:57:23.941 --> 00:57:26.511
And I'm sorry
if I don't make you a priority.

913
00:57:27.044 --> 00:57:29.847
-We.
-What're you talking about?

914
00:57:29.947 --> 00:57:32.116
We put everything
we had into this.

915
00:57:32.249 --> 00:57:35.385
In case you forgot. I quit
my job and moved here for you!

916
00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:37.387
Give me a break.

917
00:57:38.723 --> 00:57:39.957
Jeff.

918
00:57:42.392 --> 00:57:43.961
You're a really smart guy.

919
00:57:44.562 --> 00:57:46.430
Hell. the smartest guy
I've ever met.

920
00:57:46.564 --> 00:57:48.398
but you've been acting
like a complete dick

921
00:57:48.566 --> 00:57:49.800
since we've gotten here.

922
00:57:51.401 --> 00:57:53.571
How can you not see
how you're acting?

923
00:57:56.607 --> 00:58:01.411
We have a business
that has taken hundreds

924
00:58:01.546 --> 00:58:04.081
of thousands of dollars
of investor funds.

925
00:58:04.615 --> 00:58:08.418
that is days away
from potentially closing.

926
00:58:08.586 --> 00:58:11.255
We have the shittiest
fucking name on the planet.

927
00:58:11.421 --> 00:58:14.759
relentless.com.
that doesn't appeal

928
00:58:14.892 --> 00:58:16.594
to any of our customer base.

929
00:58:17.227 --> 00:58:19.329
So. we need to understand

930
00:58:19.463 --> 00:58:22.299
that Jeff may not have time
for MacKenzie.

931
00:58:22.432 --> 00:58:23.901
God.

932
00:58:24.001 --> 00:58:25.670
'Cause we have other
priorities.

933
00:58:25.803 --> 00:58:28.105
You're not even listening
to what I'm saying.

934
00:58:29.106 --> 00:58:30.808
I get that you have a lot
going on.

935
00:58:30.941 --> 00:58:32.977
I get that everything
is riding on this idea

936
00:58:33.110 --> 00:58:35.479
and I'm not asking you
to stop focusing on that.

937
00:58:35.613 --> 00:58:37.514
I'm asking you to be present.

938
00:58:39.316 --> 00:58:40.751
Be a little more human.
for God's sake.

939
00:58:40.851 --> 00:58:42.186
You're so absorbed
in the computer.

940
00:58:42.319 --> 00:58:43.954
it's like you're not even here.

941
00:58:47.124 --> 00:58:48.626
Whoa. look at that!

942
00:58:48.793 --> 00:58:50.327
-Lot of smoke.
-Yeah.

943
00:58:51.361 --> 00:58:53.998
Okay. Mm-hmm.

944
00:58:54.131 --> 00:58:56.834
Okay. There's some little
coolant over here.

945
00:58:56.967 --> 00:58:58.703
so why don't you
hand me that. Jeff?

946
00:59:02.106 --> 00:59:03.373
There we go.

947
00:59:09.179 --> 00:59:10.480
Okay.

948
00:59:13.450 --> 00:59:15.219
All right.
do you wanna turn it on now?

949
00:59:18.656 --> 00:59:20.891
-Hey!
-Whoa. you fixed it!

950
00:59:21.025 --> 00:59:22.827
You should see a mechanic.
though.

951
00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:24.662
-Thank you so much.
-You're welcome.

952
00:59:24.795 --> 00:59:26.030
You're a godsend.

953
00:59:35.372 --> 00:59:37.642
Okay. here we go.

954
00:59:37.742 --> 00:59:40.510
You know. we really. really did
a good job here today.

955
00:59:40.678 --> 00:59:42.579
We helped out--
Jeff. hey.

956
00:59:42.713 --> 00:59:44.381
-Listen to me. pay attention.
-Okay.

957
00:59:44.514 --> 00:59:46.751
We helped out today.
it's important to give back.

958
00:59:46.884 --> 00:59:49.419
and it's all about
just being human.

959
00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:51.388
-Right?
-Yes. Grandpa.

960
00:59:51.521 --> 00:59:53.157
-So. help me up.

961
00:59:54.424 --> 00:59:55.726
Jeff.

962
00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:57.094
Jeff.

963
00:59:59.196 --> 01:00:01.531
Jeff. are you seriously
not paying attention right now?

964
01:00:02.532 --> 01:00:05.703
-I've gotta go.
-Go where?

965
01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:07.604
I have an idea.

966
01:00:07.738 --> 01:00:09.774
-I need to go to the garage.
-Are you fucking kidding me!

967
01:00:09.907 --> 01:00:11.608
See. this is what I'm talking
about. you're obsessed!

968
01:00:11.742 --> 01:00:13.911
We'll talk tomorrow about this.

969
01:00:14.044 --> 01:00:15.780
No. don't treat me like
I'm one of your employees!

970
01:00:15.913 --> 01:00:18.048
-Jeff!

971
01:00:23.087 --> 01:00:24.454
Hey. guys!

972
01:01:17.942 --> 01:01:23.347
-Hey! How was your trip?
-You look like shit.

973
01:01:25.115 --> 01:01:26.683
Well.
I haven't slept at all.

974
01:01:27.617 --> 01:01:30.187
But it was worth it.
I figured something out.

975
01:01:31.655 --> 01:01:33.958
First off.
relentless.com is out.

976
01:01:34.859 --> 01:01:36.493
It makes us sound crazy.

977
01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:38.829
We don't want our secret
getting out. now. do we?

978
01:01:40.297 --> 01:01:42.299
See. whatever we call ourselves

979
01:01:42.466 --> 01:01:44.534
has to be something
we never need to change.

980
01:01:44.668 --> 01:01:46.470
Can it start
with the letter "A"?

981
01:01:46.636 --> 01:01:48.705
Search engines
have started ranking

982
01:01:48.839 --> 01:01:50.975
the sites alphabetically.
so being right at the top

983
01:01:51.141 --> 01:01:52.542
would be a huge advantage.

984
01:01:52.676 --> 01:01:54.678
-Interesting.
-I've got it.

985
01:01:56.146 --> 01:01:57.447
aar.com.

986
01:01:59.016 --> 01:02:00.350
With two "A"s.

987
01:02:01.986 --> 01:02:03.687
Short for "aardvark"?

988
01:02:04.855 --> 01:02:06.190
Keep working on it.

989
01:02:06.857 --> 01:02:10.327
You see. I realized. we've
been missing a critical factor.

990
01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:12.196
It doesn't matter
if our product library

991
01:02:12.329 --> 01:02:15.532
is the size of seven
New York City phone books.

992
01:02:15.665 --> 01:02:17.167
there's something
we've been missing.

993
01:02:17.334 --> 01:02:19.036
-Can you guess what it is?
-Wouldn't dare.

994
01:02:19.169 --> 01:02:21.671
What's the easiest
way to build customer loyalty?

995
01:02:21.839 --> 01:02:24.341
Um. coupons?

996
01:02:24.842 --> 01:02:26.076
Close.

997
01:02:26.977 --> 01:02:31.681
You see. when you go
to that independent bookstore.

998
01:02:31.816 --> 01:02:32.983
you can take your time.

999
01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:35.319
Browse.
No pressure to buy.

1000
01:02:35.419 --> 01:02:36.987
You know you're getting
a fair price.

1001
01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:38.889
That human touch.

1002
01:02:39.023 --> 01:02:42.259
Now. imagine we can create
that human touch virtually.

1003
01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:48.532
Putting the customer first
no matter what all the time.

1004
01:02:48.698 --> 01:02:50.100
Exactly.

1005
01:02:50.234 --> 01:02:52.402
You see. our competitors
are all focused

1006
01:02:52.536 --> 01:02:54.004
on what they're all doing.

1007
01:02:54.104 --> 01:02:56.040
They're not focused
on the customer.

1008
01:02:56.206 --> 01:02:58.175
We will be focused
on the customer.

1009
01:02:58.275 --> 01:03:00.277
When they get to our home page.
they're gonna see

1010
01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:04.214
our entire product library.
fair prices. fast shipping.

1011
01:03:04.348 --> 01:03:05.582
easy returns.

1012
01:03:06.050 --> 01:03:07.551
No matter what it costs.

1013
01:03:08.886 --> 01:03:10.720
The customer is always first.

1014
01:03:12.722 --> 01:03:14.558
Can you make the homepage
do that?

1015
01:03:14.724 --> 01:03:16.426
It's complicated.

1016
01:03:17.527 --> 01:03:20.730
I know. Do it.

1017
01:03:49.593 --> 01:03:51.061
Still angry?

1018
01:03:56.166 --> 01:03:57.467
I'm sorry.

1019
01:04:02.806 --> 01:04:07.011
Look. I know I've been
a little distracted by work.

1020
01:04:07.144 --> 01:04:09.113
but I'm sorry.

1021
01:04:17.121 --> 01:04:19.789
I don't need you to apologize
for focusing on the company.

1022
01:04:19.924 --> 01:04:22.459
I-- I get
that that's important.

1023
01:04:25.629 --> 01:04:28.698
I need you to apologize
for being an asshole.

1024
01:04:30.434 --> 01:04:33.137
Okay. I get it. you've been
working 18-hour days.

1025
01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:35.505
you're losing money.
you've barely eaten or slept

1026
01:04:35.639 --> 01:04:37.507
or showered. I get that.
I see it.

1027
01:04:38.808 --> 01:04:40.610
But that doesn't give you
a right to treat me

1028
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:42.346
the way
you've been treating me.

1029
01:04:48.318 --> 01:04:49.686
You're right.

1030
01:04:51.821 --> 01:04:53.890
I've lost focus
on what's important

1031
01:04:55.993 --> 01:04:58.695
and it will never happen again.

1032
01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:06.036
I love you.

1033
01:05:10.474 --> 01:05:12.042
I love you. too.

1034
01:05:16.346 --> 01:05:20.050
So. how's the site
coming along?

1035
01:05:20.184 --> 01:05:21.751
Work in progress.

1036
01:05:21.885 --> 01:05:24.021
I got the boys working
on something right now.

1037
01:05:24.188 --> 01:05:26.523
Yeah?
What're they working on?

1038
01:05:27.857 --> 01:05:30.260
Something to help
improve customer experience.

1039
01:05:30.394 --> 01:05:33.530
give people that in-store
touchy feeling.

1040
01:05:33.663 --> 01:05:36.233
You know. the human touch
when shopping.

1041
01:05:38.202 --> 01:05:39.769
You came up with that
on your own?

1042
01:05:39.903 --> 01:05:41.671
Yeah.
last night in the garage.

1043
01:05:45.709 --> 01:05:47.844
Still gotta figure out a new
name for the site. though.

1044
01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:50.880
Wait. You're a writer.

1045
01:05:51.048 --> 01:05:52.716
You should have hundreds
of ideas.

1046
01:05:54.218 --> 01:05:55.519
Okay.

1047
01:05:57.054 --> 01:05:59.223
-I don't know.
-Come on.

1048
01:06:01.725 --> 01:06:05.229
But I-- I struggle with titles.
like. I...

1049
01:06:08.732 --> 01:06:15.239
How 'bout...
earthsbiggestbookstore.com?

1050
01:06:16.906 --> 01:06:19.576
Little wordy.
Great tagline. though.

1051
01:06:21.078 --> 01:06:22.312
Sorry.

1052
01:06:22.446 --> 01:06:24.914
Anyways.
we have bigger fish to fry.

1053
01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:28.252
-Investors?
-Yup.

1054
01:06:28.785 --> 01:06:31.588
I sometimes feel like these
investors are just wasting

1055
01:06:31.755 --> 01:06:33.590
my life away. to be honest.

1056
01:06:34.924 --> 01:06:36.760
I'm sure
you'll figure something out.

1057
01:06:39.263 --> 01:06:40.764
It better happen soon.

1058
01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:45.402
We're running out of time.

1059
01:06:46.436 --> 01:06:48.905
The plan's
to open 97 new superstores

1060
01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:52.242
in addition to its already
existing 261 locations.

1061
01:06:52.342 --> 01:06:54.244
Will this be the end
for independent booksellers?

1062
01:06:54.344 --> 01:06:55.979
Would you mind
turning that TV off?

1063
01:06:58.615 --> 01:07:00.817
-Up next!

1064
01:07:06.956 --> 01:07:08.325
Still don't like it.

1065
01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:11.128
Why not?

1066
01:07:11.795 --> 01:07:13.463
It's not clever enough.

1067
01:07:15.299 --> 01:07:16.966
You said you wanted it simple.

1068
01:07:17.634 --> 01:07:20.504
Simple. but it needs
to have a little bit of...

1069
01:07:20.637 --> 01:07:21.971
What's that word?

1070
01:07:22.106 --> 01:07:24.341
-Charm?
-Exactly.

1071
01:07:24.474 --> 01:07:28.812
You see. it needs to be
charming. make customers smile.

1072
01:07:33.317 --> 01:07:34.651
What's a smile again?

1073
01:07:35.352 --> 01:07:37.487
I think it's the opposite
of that.

1074
01:07:42.192 --> 01:07:43.860
We'll tackle it after lunch.

1075
01:07:44.728 --> 01:07:46.330
You care to join us?

1076
01:07:47.364 --> 01:07:48.898
Not today. boys.

1077
01:07:49.032 --> 01:07:51.301
I need to go have lunch
with an investor.

1078
01:07:54.371 --> 01:07:55.705
-Jeff.
-Yeah.

1079
01:07:55.839 --> 01:07:57.241
Before you go...

1080
01:07:58.542 --> 01:08:00.377
There's a couple of things
that we've been meaning

1081
01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:02.146
-to talk to you about.
-Sure.

1082
01:08:02.246 --> 01:08:05.048
First.
any luck getting us that help?

1083
01:08:05.582 --> 01:08:08.152
The ad's out. but. you know.
I haven't got any leads.

1084
01:08:08.252 --> 01:08:10.420
You mean this job ad?

1085
01:08:12.021 --> 01:08:14.658
"You must have experience
designing and building large

1086
01:08:14.758 --> 01:08:16.760
and complex.
yet maintainable systems.

1087
01:08:16.893 --> 01:08:19.095
and you should be able to do
so in about one-third

1088
01:08:19.229 --> 01:08:21.565
of the time that most competent
people think possible."

1089
01:08:21.698 --> 01:08:24.234
-Perfect.
-"You should have a master's

1090
01:08:24.368 --> 01:08:25.902
degree or doctorate
from a top university.

1091
01:08:26.035 --> 01:08:28.605
World class communication
skills are essential."

1092
01:08:28.738 --> 01:08:30.207
Excellent.

1093
01:08:32.176 --> 01:08:33.543
You go.

1094
01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:35.545
It'll sound nicer
in an English accent.

1095
01:08:36.546 --> 01:08:38.215
With all due respect.
Jeffrey.

1096
01:08:38.882 --> 01:08:40.717
have you lost your bloody mind?

1097
01:08:41.218 --> 01:08:42.786
Why on Earth would someone

1098
01:08:42.919 --> 01:08:44.621
with those qualifications
want to work here?

1099
01:08:44.754 --> 01:08:46.223
You're both working here.

1100
01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:47.891
But you're not describing us
at all.

1101
01:08:48.057 --> 01:08:50.026
Shel attended UC Santa Cruz.

1102
01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:52.061
I got my postdoc in Israel.

1103
01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:54.798
We're not the best.
we're merely the most

1104
01:08:54.931 --> 01:08:57.934
willing to work like dogs
for ludicrously low pay.

1105
01:08:58.802 --> 01:09:00.737
Time is running out.
Jeff. you gotta get off

1106
01:09:00.904 --> 01:09:02.972
your high horse and hire
whoever the hell you can get.

1107
01:09:03.106 --> 01:09:05.475
So. basically
any capable human being?

1108
01:09:07.277 --> 01:09:09.246
All right.
I'll put MacKenzie on it.

1109
01:09:09.413 --> 01:09:11.248
but we gotta figure out where
we're gonna put these people.

1110
01:09:11.415 --> 01:09:13.817
That brings us
to the second thing

1111
01:09:13.950 --> 01:09:15.585
we wanted to talk to you about.

1112
01:09:15.752 --> 01:09:17.954
I mean. look around.
Jeff. come on.

1113
01:09:19.088 --> 01:09:20.924
We could move
those file cabinets

1114
01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:23.593
and squeeze in a couple
of desks over there.

1115
01:09:24.928 --> 01:09:27.964
How are we gonna buy desks?
We've got no money.

1116
01:09:28.097 --> 01:09:30.667
-Jeff!
-Fine.

1117
01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:32.936
We'll figure something out.
All right?

1118
01:09:33.437 --> 01:09:34.938
Maybe I'll use a door.

1119
01:09:42.479 --> 01:09:45.349
Niko! How are you? It's Jeff.

1120
01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:51.321
We're in Seattle
working on a new startup.

1121
01:09:51.988 --> 01:09:53.490
You wanna come over?

1122
01:09:55.625 --> 01:09:57.026
The pay's shit.

1123
01:09:59.496 --> 01:10:02.098
Sure. it probably
pays more than that.

1124
01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.436
All right.
I'll send you some information.

1125
01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:09.138
Bye.

1126
01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.716
Hello? Arthur!

1127
01:10:19.849 --> 01:10:21.685
It's good to hear from you.

1128
01:10:22.286 --> 01:10:23.520
How's the business coming?

1129
01:10:25.855 --> 01:10:28.658
Yeah.
That's what I like to hear.

1130
01:10:28.825 --> 01:10:31.160
So. to what do I owe
the pleasure today?

1131
01:10:34.664 --> 01:10:39.869
Yeah. yeah. I've heard of it.
the so-called online bookstore.

1132
01:10:44.974 --> 01:10:46.209
Really?

1133
01:10:47.344 --> 01:10:50.914
Yeah. uh-- I-- Thanks. Arthur.
I appreciate you telling me.

1134
01:10:51.047 --> 01:10:52.916
Oh. you better believe
I'm gonna take care of this.

1135
01:10:53.049 --> 01:10:56.420
Yeah. thanks again.
Yeah. we'll talk soon.

1136
01:10:59.556 --> 01:11:01.024
This is where
the magic happens.

1137
01:11:09.032 --> 01:11:10.734
It's a dump.

1138
01:11:10.867 --> 01:11:13.503
I know. Come on. that's
your desk right over there.

1139
01:11:20.410 --> 01:11:22.045
Is this a door?

1140
01:11:22.546 --> 01:11:23.947
It's the best desk
money can buy.

1141
01:11:25.915 --> 01:11:27.617
Now. here's the rest
of the team.

1142
01:11:27.751 --> 01:11:30.053
Shel. Paul. MacKenzie you know.

1143
01:11:30.219 --> 01:11:31.888
Of course.
Hey. MacKenzie.

1144
01:11:32.055 --> 01:11:35.058
So. you've got your computer.
your full setup there.

1145
01:11:35.559 --> 01:11:37.561
-Hey. Jeff.
-Slight problem.

1146
01:11:37.694 --> 01:11:39.095
How slight?

1147
01:11:39.228 --> 01:11:40.964
One that threatens
our very existence.

1148
01:11:41.097 --> 01:11:42.566
British drôlerie there?

1149
01:11:42.732 --> 01:11:44.968
No. deadly serious.
I'm afraid.

1150
01:11:45.769 --> 01:11:47.737
I went to run a test
on the checkout

1151
01:11:47.904 --> 01:11:49.906
to see if we could order
an actual book

1152
01:11:50.073 --> 01:11:52.141
and. to my horror.
the distributor requires

1153
01:11:52.275 --> 01:11:54.444
a 10-book minimum order
on all retailers.

1154
01:11:54.578 --> 01:11:55.912
What?

1155
01:11:56.079 --> 01:11:58.415
Ten books per order.
no exceptions.

1156
01:11:58.582 --> 01:11:59.883
That makes no sense.

1157
01:11:59.983 --> 01:12:02.151
I know. I told them that.

1158
01:12:02.285 --> 01:12:03.920
But seeing as they're
the largest distributor

1159
01:12:04.087 --> 01:12:05.922
with five million titles
and I'm a nobody.

1160
01:12:06.089 --> 01:12:07.757
they weren't really
interested in my opinion.

1161
01:12:07.924 --> 01:12:10.093
It's just how they've always
done business.

1162
01:12:10.259 --> 01:12:11.961
Let's try a different
distributor.

1163
01:12:12.095 --> 01:12:13.997
The only other
distributor that matters

1164
01:12:14.130 --> 01:12:15.765
has the identical policy.

1165
01:12:15.932 --> 01:12:18.835
I humbled myself.
begged them to let our poor.

1166
01:12:18.968 --> 01:12:21.270
fledgling company order
less than a minimum

1167
01:12:21.438 --> 01:12:23.673
and they told me
to go fuck myself.

1168
01:12:24.441 --> 01:12:27.477
Not in those words exactly.
but pretty close.

1169
01:12:28.978 --> 01:12:30.447
So. what's the bottom line?

1170
01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:32.649
For every one book we order.

1171
01:12:32.782 --> 01:12:34.350
we're gonna have to pay
for ten.

1172
01:12:34.484 --> 01:12:36.119
We're gonna burn
through our cash reserves

1173
01:12:36.252 --> 01:12:38.187
in less than three months.

1174
01:12:38.788 --> 01:12:40.657
And then we'll be swimming
in inventory

1175
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:42.626
we don't even need
with no place to put it.

1176
01:12:53.336 --> 01:12:55.138
How does the payment work?

1177
01:12:56.806 --> 01:12:59.008
Do they charge you
when you order the book?

1178
01:13:00.477 --> 01:13:01.878
Or when they ship it?

1179
01:13:02.646 --> 01:13:04.147
Or when we actually get it?

1180
01:13:04.313 --> 01:13:06.616
-When the books arrive.
-You're sure?

1181
01:13:06.716 --> 01:13:08.117
Yeah.

1182
01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:09.953
So. if we order ten books.

1183
01:13:10.053 --> 01:13:11.655
but only seven arrive--

1184
01:13:11.821 --> 01:13:13.389
We're only billed
for the seven.

1185
01:13:13.523 --> 01:13:15.324
-Niko!
-Yeah.

1186
01:13:15.492 --> 01:13:16.893
You were a biology teacher.

1187
01:13:17.026 --> 01:13:18.995
-Yeah.
-I need you to find me

1188
01:13:19.162 --> 01:13:21.030
the most obscure science
book out there.

1189
01:13:21.164 --> 01:13:23.132
Something that is impossible
to find.

1190
01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:38.347
Here's a hot title.

1191
01:13:38.515 --> 01:13:41.217
The Lichen-Flora of Chicago
and Vicinity

1192
01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:43.386
by William Wirt Calkins.

1193
01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:48.892
Carver Press. 1896.
Definitely out of print.

1194
01:13:49.025 --> 01:13:50.760
Perfect.

1195
01:13:50.894 --> 01:13:52.862
Now. what's the name
of the new Grisham book?

1196
01:13:52.996 --> 01:13:54.698
The Rainmaker.

1197
01:13:54.864 --> 01:13:56.700
Let's go ahead and order
one copy of The Rainmaker.

1198
01:13:57.534 --> 01:14:00.870
nine copies
of Niko's science book.

1199
01:14:02.038 --> 01:14:04.107
And the distributor
should only charge us

1200
01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:05.942
for the one copy
of The Rainmaker.

1201
01:14:06.776 --> 01:14:08.778
Yeah. And if any of the back
ordered books arrive.

1202
01:14:08.912 --> 01:14:10.213
we'll just return them.

1203
01:14:11.214 --> 01:14:12.616
Now what?

1204
01:14:12.749 --> 01:14:14.250
We wait. I suppose.

1205
01:14:14.718 --> 01:14:17.721
No. Full speed ahead.

1206
01:14:17.887 --> 01:14:19.355
Even if it's off a cliff?

1207
01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:22.626
We've done worse. Let's go!

1208
01:14:22.759 --> 01:14:26.129
-Full steam.

1209
01:14:26.262 --> 01:14:27.764
Hello?

1210
01:14:29.432 --> 01:14:30.734
Yeah. this is him.

1211
01:14:36.072 --> 01:14:38.908
I'm available.
Tomorrow?

1212
01:14:42.111 --> 01:14:44.447
I'll be there. Thank you.

1213
01:14:50.219 --> 01:14:51.988
That was Leonard Riggio
of Barnes & Noble.

1214
01:14:52.121 --> 01:14:53.489
What did he want?

1215
01:14:53.623 --> 01:14:54.991
He wants to meet tomorrow.

1216
01:14:55.792 --> 01:14:58.061
Something about
a business opportunity.

1217
01:14:58.562 --> 01:15:00.096
Well. that's good.

1218
01:15:01.097 --> 01:15:04.668
Yeah. That's good.

1219
01:15:38.467 --> 01:15:41.470
-Jeff?
-Oh. Mr. Riggio.

1220
01:15:42.839 --> 01:15:44.540
-Pleasure.
-Good to see you.

1221
01:15:46.776 --> 01:15:48.678
What would you like
to talk about?

1222
01:15:48.812 --> 01:15:51.848
An old friend
gave me a call the other day.

1223
01:15:53.016 --> 01:15:54.684
Told me about you. actually.

1224
01:15:55.284 --> 01:15:57.186
Seems you didn't take my advice

1225
01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:00.624
and you're still going around
trying to get investments.

1226
01:16:01.124 --> 01:16:02.659
Can you blame me?

1227
01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:07.063
See. it's not that you're
pursuing this silly little idea

1228
01:16:07.196 --> 01:16:09.332
that bothers me.
it's the fact that apparently

1229
01:16:09.498 --> 01:16:10.734
you still are referring to it

1230
01:16:10.867 --> 01:16:12.168
as the world's
biggest bookstore.

1231
01:16:13.670 --> 01:16:15.204
I don't see a problem with it.

1232
01:16:15.338 --> 01:16:17.206
You-- You don't see
why that offends me?

1233
01:16:18.007 --> 01:16:19.909
-No.
-Well. then. I'll tell you.

1234
01:16:21.678 --> 01:16:23.579
How old are you Jeff?
What. about 35?

1235
01:16:23.713 --> 01:16:25.248
Thirty-one.

1236
01:16:25.381 --> 01:16:28.384
When you were a one-year-old.

1237
01:16:28.517 --> 01:16:32.856
I opened a little shop called.
uh. Student Book Exchange.

1238
01:16:33.522 --> 01:16:35.692
I was just a kid
at the time at NYU.

1239
01:16:35.825 --> 01:16:39.362
but it turned into be
a major retailer.

1240
01:16:39.528 --> 01:16:41.264
Coast to coast.

1241
01:16:41.397 --> 01:16:43.532
Well. I mean. that's amazing.

1242
01:16:43.667 --> 01:16:46.235
You should just listen.
you might learn something.

1243
01:16:47.370 --> 01:16:49.205
So. a little bit later.

1244
01:16:49.338 --> 01:16:50.907
it was when you were
about seven years old.

1245
01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:54.043
I acquired a little shop
called Barnes & Noble.

1246
01:16:54.210 --> 01:16:56.245
and I liked its name.
so I used it

1247
01:16:56.379 --> 01:16:58.214
after I picked up
a few hundred more shops.

1248
01:16:59.215 --> 01:17:02.051
But Wall Street said.
"Well. there's no more room.

1249
01:17:02.218 --> 01:17:04.420
my friend. to grow
in the book industry."

1250
01:17:04.553 --> 01:17:09.225
and I said. "Fuck you.
I'm just getting started."

1251
01:17:10.259 --> 01:17:12.595
And that's when I invented
the superstore.

1252
01:17:13.229 --> 01:17:16.966
So. you don't understand
why you calling yourself

1253
01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:18.902
the world's biggest
bookstore offends me?

1254
01:17:19.602 --> 01:17:22.305
Well. it's because
it's a goddamn lie.

1255
01:17:22.438 --> 01:17:25.441
We hold that title and will
for many more years to come.

1256
01:17:25.975 --> 01:17:27.744
And if we ever lose it.

1257
01:17:27.911 --> 01:17:32.716
it'll be to Crown or.
I don't know. Kmart or Borders.

1258
01:17:34.083 --> 01:17:36.585
Not to some dope who's
working out of a shit hole.

1259
01:17:36.753 --> 01:17:39.723
who hasn't sold one
single book in his entire life.

1260
01:17:39.823 --> 01:17:41.057
I understand.

1261
01:17:41.157 --> 01:17:44.227
Yeah. I'm pretty articulate.

1262
01:17:45.929 --> 01:17:48.564
You see. it's not meant to be
taken literally.

1263
01:17:49.265 --> 01:17:51.234
It's just a way
for our customers to understand

1264
01:17:51.334 --> 01:17:54.003
the vast extent and potential
of the Internet.

1265
01:17:54.137 --> 01:17:56.172
See. I don't care
what your intentions are.

1266
01:17:56.305 --> 01:17:58.274
just stop saying it.

1267
01:17:59.275 --> 01:18:01.945
You don't
and I'll sue your ass.

1268
01:18:02.645 --> 01:18:05.081
But not right now. no.

1269
01:18:05.181 --> 01:18:07.316
Not even after you've actually
sold a few thousand books.

1270
01:18:07.450 --> 01:18:09.652
I'm gonna wait
for just the right time.

1271
01:18:09.786 --> 01:18:11.120
like the week
that you go public.

1272
01:18:11.755 --> 01:18:13.790
And then you'll be dead
in the crib.

1273
01:18:14.490 --> 01:18:17.961
Or I can make you
a proposal right now

1274
01:18:18.127 --> 01:18:21.030
so we can bury this idea five
feet. under where it belongs.

1275
01:18:22.631 --> 01:18:25.501
Barnes & Noble is willing
to acquire this idea

1276
01:18:25.634 --> 01:18:28.337
from you for the gracious
sum of $1 million.

1277
01:18:29.505 --> 01:18:31.808
I mean. God knows that's
more than what it's worth.

1278
01:18:32.275 --> 01:18:34.210
But. you know.
it should be enough for you

1279
01:18:34.343 --> 01:18:35.812
to cover and recoup
your losses.

1280
01:18:35.945 --> 01:18:37.513
pay whoever you owe.

1281
01:18:37.646 --> 01:18:40.817
and bother someone
other than myself.

1282
01:18:42.118 --> 01:18:43.486
You're naive.

1283
01:18:44.988 --> 01:18:48.657
Frankly.
insults me to a degree.

1284
01:18:48.825 --> 01:18:54.730
but you have ambition that
reminds me of my younger self.

1285
01:18:55.664 --> 01:18:57.666
I. too. had dreams
of being a conqueror.

1286
01:18:57.834 --> 01:19:02.738
but you would be a fool
not to take this offer.

1287
01:19:07.676 --> 01:19:09.012
See.
you have one thing wrong.

1288
01:19:10.914 --> 01:19:12.415
I'm not a conqueror.

1289
01:19:14.017 --> 01:19:15.518
I'm an explorer.

1290
01:19:15.684 --> 01:19:17.386
What's the difference?

1291
01:19:19.188 --> 01:19:20.756
It pays to explore.

1292
01:19:23.226 --> 01:19:25.829
You remember that time
at that bar in Miami?

1293
01:19:27.230 --> 01:19:28.764
I was so excited.

1294
01:19:28.898 --> 01:19:31.700
I'm meeting Leonard Riggio.
the legend.

1295
01:19:31.868 --> 01:19:35.704
CEO of Barnes & Noble.
and inviting him

1296
01:19:35.872 --> 01:19:39.375
on this journey with me
to invest in amazon.com.

1297
01:19:40.877 --> 01:19:42.678
And when you walked out
on that meeting.

1298
01:19:42.778 --> 01:19:44.547
I realized something.

1299
01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:51.387
You're the past
and I'm the future.

1300
01:19:52.721 --> 01:19:55.624
And one day. your stores
will start to close.

1301
01:19:55.758 --> 01:19:57.593
just like all those
independent bookstores

1302
01:19:57.726 --> 01:19:59.896
you proudly
put out of business.

1303
01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:03.566
And your empire
will begin to crumble

1304
01:20:04.133 --> 01:20:06.936
the day that my website
goes live.

1305
01:20:28.958 --> 01:20:31.460
Jeff? How'd it go?

1306
01:20:31.594 --> 01:20:33.162
-Good.

1307
01:20:33.296 --> 01:20:35.098
He offered to buy us out.

1308
01:20:35.764 --> 01:20:37.266
-What?
-How much?

1309
01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:38.767
A million.

1310
01:20:41.637 --> 01:20:43.439
Yes!

1311
01:20:45.141 --> 01:20:47.110
You said yes. right?

1312
01:20:47.610 --> 01:20:49.312
I told him to go fuck himself.

1313
01:20:49.445 --> 01:20:51.114
Are you bloody mad?

1314
01:20:53.749 --> 01:20:56.986
You see. he's willing
to pay us a million dollars

1315
01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:59.956
before we're even live.
Doesn't that tell you anything?

1316
01:21:00.123 --> 01:21:03.126
He's scared. He's scared
of what we're gonna become.

1317
01:21:03.292 --> 01:21:05.161
Jeff. be sensible.

1318
01:21:05.294 --> 01:21:07.663
We don't have any cash.
we don't have any investors.

1319
01:21:07.796 --> 01:21:09.698
At this rate. we're never
gonna get off the ground.

1320
01:21:09.832 --> 01:21:11.500
Why are you challenging me
about this?

1321
01:21:11.634 --> 01:21:13.669
I'm not challenging you.

1322
01:21:13.802 --> 01:21:15.804
Listen. do I need to go
under this table.

1323
01:21:15.972 --> 01:21:17.706
get the certificate
that says I'm the CEO

1324
01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:19.775
of this company
to tell you to trust me?

1325
01:21:20.643 --> 01:21:22.011
Honey...

1326
01:21:22.645 --> 01:21:26.182
Anyways. after what I told him.
that deal's gone.

1327
01:21:26.315 --> 01:21:28.184
But I do have good news.

1328
01:21:28.317 --> 01:21:31.687
What good news could you
possibly give us after this?

1329
01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:33.122
Our name.

1330
01:21:34.323 --> 01:21:35.824
Come on. Get close.

1331
01:21:35.992 --> 01:21:37.660
Come on! Drumroll. please.

1332
01:21:47.503 --> 01:21:50.073
Whoa!

1333
01:21:51.507 --> 01:21:52.908
I like that!

1334
01:21:53.042 --> 01:21:55.744
Amazon.com!

1335
01:21:55.878 --> 01:21:57.981
Named after the world's
largest river!

1336
01:21:58.081 --> 01:22:00.984
Actually. five times bigger
than the second largest river.

1337
01:22:01.084 --> 01:22:02.918
Bet he tells us
what it is.

1338
01:22:03.052 --> 01:22:04.820
The Congo. of course.

1339
01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:06.922
Amazon.com is a name
we'll never need to change.

1340
01:22:07.056 --> 01:22:11.094
It tells everybody that we are
the world's biggest bookstore.

1341
01:22:11.227 --> 01:22:13.529
And it starts with an A.
just for you.

1342
01:22:16.432 --> 01:22:22.405
-Yeah.
-Um. is it Amazon.com

1343
01:22:23.072 --> 01:22:26.042
or without and just Amazon?

1344
01:22:26.209 --> 01:22:29.378
It's Amazon.com. The dot com
is-- is to be included

1345
01:22:29.545 --> 01:22:31.080
in every instance.

1346
01:22:31.214 --> 01:22:34.950
One more question. Um. why?

1347
01:22:35.851 --> 01:22:37.786
See.
the dot com tells our customers

1348
01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:41.557
that we exist exclusively
on the internet.

1349
01:22:41.690 --> 01:22:44.227
That's true of a lot of places.

1350
01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:46.629
No one else uses the dot com.

1351
01:22:47.563 --> 01:22:49.798
But we will be the first.

1352
01:22:52.435 --> 01:22:54.903
All right. Niko. you still
got those friends in New York?

1353
01:22:55.071 --> 01:22:56.905
Sure. I know some guys.

1354
01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:58.307
Well. we need to raise
some money fast.

1355
01:22:58.441 --> 01:22:59.908
Let's get some new investors.

1356
01:23:00.043 --> 01:23:01.410
Shel. let's pull up
that homepage.

1357
01:23:01.577 --> 01:23:02.911
Come on. let's get to work.

1358
01:23:07.250 --> 01:23:10.086
Now. see where it says
"World's Biggest Bookstore?"

1359
01:23:10.719 --> 01:23:12.255
Cut it.

1360
01:23:12.421 --> 01:23:14.490
Now. scroll
all the way to the top.

1361
01:23:16.092 --> 01:23:19.595
Right there. On the top.

1362
01:23:23.999 --> 01:23:25.301
Bolder.

1363
01:23:26.102 --> 01:23:28.971
Bolder. Perfect.

1364
01:24:02.538 --> 01:24:04.440
Yeah.

1365
01:24:23.126 --> 01:24:25.861
-It worked!

1366
01:24:25.994 --> 01:24:28.997
-Whoo!
-Nice.

1367
01:24:29.132 --> 01:24:31.334
-Oh. wow.

1368
01:24:32.668 --> 01:24:34.570
Because it's an online model.

1369
01:24:34.703 --> 01:24:37.005
we believe we can have
significant cost advantages

1370
01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:38.874
and undercut our competitors.

1371
01:24:39.007 --> 01:24:40.676
And what's to stop them
both from opening

1372
01:24:40.809 --> 01:24:42.578
their own online stores?

1373
01:24:42.711 --> 01:24:44.847
Well. they likely will.
Um. but they're doomed to fail.

1374
01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:46.515
Because they're probably
gonna be competing

1375
01:24:46.649 --> 01:24:48.217
with themselves
in that scenario. right?

1376
01:24:48.351 --> 01:24:50.353
Exactly.
Their physical locations.

1377
01:24:50.486 --> 01:24:52.020
And to compete.
they're gonna have to close

1378
01:24:52.155 --> 01:24:53.722
those physical locations.

1379
01:24:53.856 --> 01:24:55.591
and I doubt
they're gonna do that.

1380
01:24:55.724 --> 01:24:57.426
And if they do.
it's not gonna be anytime soon.

1381
01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:59.528
By then. Amazon will have
the market share

1382
01:24:59.695 --> 01:25:01.264
and it'll be too late.

1383
01:25:01.397 --> 01:25:04.032
Exactly. We believe that
we will probably lose money

1384
01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:06.369
for up to 20 years.

1385
01:25:06.502 --> 01:25:09.538
Uh. but at Amazon.com.
we're focused on the long-term.

1386
01:25:09.672 --> 01:25:12.241
Uh. not short-term
profitability.

1387
01:25:12.375 --> 01:25:15.077
Um. because we don't charge
our customers sales tax.

1388
01:25:15.211 --> 01:25:18.714
uh. we believe we can continue
to gain market share.

1389
01:25:18.847 --> 01:25:20.616
um. without profitability.

1390
01:25:20.749 --> 01:25:23.719
You're talking about
monopolizing the market here.

1391
01:25:23.886 --> 01:25:25.888
You really want to get
into that. Mr. Bezos?

1392
01:25:26.054 --> 01:25:29.225
Monopolizing is-- is a very.
uh. harsh word.

1393
01:25:29.392 --> 01:25:31.527
Um. it's more survival
of the fittest.

1394
01:25:31.627 --> 01:25:33.596
Um. the smaller companies
will fail.

1395
01:25:33.729 --> 01:25:35.864
Obviously.
in order for us to succeed.

1396
01:25:35.964 --> 01:25:37.933
we need to continuously
be raising capital.

1397
01:25:38.066 --> 01:25:41.437
and. um. this company will
require significant amounts

1398
01:25:41.570 --> 01:25:43.639
of capital if we're gonna
build the infrastructure

1399
01:25:43.772 --> 01:25:45.140
and the system
to have higher revenue

1400
01:25:45.274 --> 01:25:46.809
and higher profitability
down the road.

1401
01:25:46.942 --> 01:25:48.977
But you have
so many big box stores.

1402
01:25:49.111 --> 01:25:50.713
They're not gonna let you
get away with this.

1403
01:25:50.813 --> 01:25:52.781
Well. physical locations
are paying up

1404
01:25:52.915 --> 01:25:55.251
to $10 a square foot
when we pay pennies

1405
01:25:55.418 --> 01:25:56.819
a square foot
for our warehouses

1406
01:25:56.952 --> 01:25:58.554
that can be located
just outside

1407
01:25:58.654 --> 01:26:00.389
of big metropolitan areas.

1408
01:26:00.489 --> 01:26:02.591
Uh. we only have a small
facility right now in Seattle.

1409
01:26:02.758 --> 01:26:05.794
but we believe expanding
those facilities nationwide

1410
01:26:05.928 --> 01:26:08.096
will get the product
to our customers quicker

1411
01:26:08.264 --> 01:26:11.267
and allow us to maintain
that lower cost structure.

1412
01:26:11.434 --> 01:26:13.636
To me.
if I'm hearing you correctly.

1413
01:26:13.769 --> 01:26:15.604
you're open 24 hours.

1414
01:26:15.771 --> 01:26:18.173
it's faster and easier
to buy books.

1415
01:26:18.307 --> 01:26:20.243
it's cheaper
'cause of sales tax.

1416
01:26:20.343 --> 01:26:22.345
and it's cheaper
for you to deliver that

1417
01:26:22.478 --> 01:26:24.680
'cause you don't have the cost
of brick and mortar.

1418
01:26:24.813 --> 01:26:26.315
Does it end with books.

1419
01:26:26.449 --> 01:26:28.183
or would there be
an opportunity to sell

1420
01:26:28.317 --> 01:26:30.185
other products and services
to this customer base?

1421
01:26:30.319 --> 01:26:33.121
Other categories that we look
to expand into are music

1422
01:26:33.289 --> 01:26:36.459
and. um. other
vast library categories.

1423
01:26:45.968 --> 01:26:49.305
I mean that was the greatest
performance ever.

1424
01:26:49.438 --> 01:26:51.340
-Thanks!
-And it means a lot. like.

1425
01:26:51.474 --> 01:26:53.509
when you said
full steam ahead. like this--

1426
01:26:53.642 --> 01:26:55.344
But what about
small businesses?

1427
01:26:55.478 --> 01:26:57.813
-What about 'em?
-They're honest people.

1428
01:26:57.946 --> 01:26:59.682
We're a small business.

1429
01:26:59.815 --> 01:27:01.149
we should be helping
each other out.

1430
01:27:01.284 --> 01:27:02.985
We won't be for long.

1431
01:27:03.118 --> 01:27:05.821
If this is gonna work.
we have to continue to scale.

1432
01:27:09.525 --> 01:27:11.660
-All right. team.

1433
01:27:13.296 --> 01:27:17.333
So. as you all know.
beta testing begins today.

1434
01:27:17.833 --> 01:27:20.168
We've assembled a list of
several hundred of our friends

1435
01:27:20.336 --> 01:27:22.338
and family
that will be receiving a link

1436
01:27:22.471 --> 01:27:25.374
to a test site where
they can place test orders.

1437
01:27:25.508 --> 01:27:27.343
Of course.
they could place a real order.

1438
01:27:27.476 --> 01:27:28.644
but there's a chance that

1439
01:27:28.744 --> 01:27:30.145
there'll still be some
glitches.

1440
01:27:30.245 --> 01:27:33.649
Now. there's a lot
of work to be done

1441
01:27:33.749 --> 01:27:39.555
before the whole site goes live
in July. but there's a saying.

1442
01:27:39.688 --> 01:27:41.557
You can work long.
you can work hard.

1443
01:27:41.690 --> 01:27:43.191
and you can work smart.

1444
01:27:43.359 --> 01:27:44.760
but you can only
pick two of them.

1445
01:27:45.361 --> 01:27:48.831
At Amazon.com. we need
all three every single day.

1446
01:27:48.931 --> 01:27:52.267
If we're gonna make Amazon.com
the world's greatest website.

1447
01:27:52.401 --> 01:27:55.070
it begins with all
of our hard work.

1448
01:27:55.203 --> 01:27:56.605
So. let's go.

1449
01:28:17.393 --> 01:28:19.061
Ready?

1450
01:28:26.068 --> 01:28:28.971
-We're live.

1451
01:28:52.395 --> 01:28:54.329
I'm going to get
something to eat.

1452
01:28:55.631 --> 01:28:56.999
Care to join me?

1453
01:28:59.101 --> 01:29:00.836
-I'm gonna hang back.
-All right.

1454
01:29:01.570 --> 01:29:03.672
-Niko?
-Yeah. I could eat.

1455
01:29:04.473 --> 01:29:07.175
-Jeff?
-I'm good. thank you.

1456
01:29:07.309 --> 01:29:10.446
-All right.

1457
01:29:24.427 --> 01:29:25.994
Jeff. can I talk to you
for a second?

1458
01:29:26.128 --> 01:29:27.463
Sure.

1459
01:29:29.632 --> 01:29:31.634
So. I guess because
we're on the home stretch now.

1460
01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:33.368
I've been thinking.

1461
01:29:33.502 --> 01:29:35.370
I look at everything
I've given to this company

1462
01:29:35.504 --> 01:29:38.140
and quite frankly.
I put everything I had into it.

1463
01:29:38.306 --> 01:29:40.008
Paul has. too.

1464
01:29:40.142 --> 01:29:41.710
I mean. we built the damn site.

1465
01:29:41.844 --> 01:29:43.311
The site is everything.
you know that.

1466
01:29:43.979 --> 01:29:45.548
You guys are rock stars.
I know.

1467
01:29:47.215 --> 01:29:49.117
So. I guess
what I'm wondering is.

1468
01:29:49.217 --> 01:29:51.987
why aren't we founders
along with you and MacKenzie?

1469
01:29:52.154 --> 01:29:54.457
Why aren't we receiving
founder's shares?

1470
01:29:57.560 --> 01:29:58.961
'Cause you never asked.

1471
01:30:02.330 --> 01:30:04.567
You remember that time
we got together for coffee?

1472
01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:06.569
Came up with the terms
of your agreement.

1473
01:30:06.702 --> 01:30:09.638
wrote up the contract.
which you signed.

1474
01:30:11.006 --> 01:30:16.011
Now. whatever the difference
is from what you did receive

1475
01:30:17.345 --> 01:30:20.683
to what you believe you're due
should be a lesson to you.

1476
01:30:21.383 --> 01:30:24.419
Know your worth. Shel.

1477
01:30:27.556 --> 01:30:29.658
When we had first met
in that coffee shop.

1478
01:30:29.758 --> 01:30:31.259
I knew my worth.

1479
01:30:32.027 --> 01:30:34.162
I knew my worth so much.
I was willing to follow

1480
01:30:34.262 --> 01:30:36.699
this dream of yours
to revolutionize commerce.

1481
01:30:38.066 --> 01:30:39.902
I know you wanna
change the world.

1482
01:30:40.035 --> 01:30:42.070
Jeff. but what're you trying
to change it to?

1483
01:30:42.871 --> 01:30:44.740
Huh. To think
I figured you out.

1484
01:30:52.581 --> 01:30:54.216
I just want to make history.

1485
01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:40.963
Hey. I'm going to bed.
You should. too.

1486
01:31:41.096 --> 01:31:45.067
-I should. too.
-No. but really. You should.

1487
01:31:46.602 --> 01:31:48.303
It's the weekend.

1488
01:31:48.436 --> 01:31:50.405
The test is running smoothly.
and there's no reason

1489
01:31:50.505 --> 01:31:52.507
why you can't get a good
night's sleep with your wife.

1490
01:31:54.610 --> 01:31:56.111
While you're at it.

1491
01:31:56.278 --> 01:31:57.780
why don't you send
Paul and Shel home. too.

1492
01:31:57.946 --> 01:31:59.615
You're right.

1493
01:32:00.282 --> 01:32:02.017
Don't sound too excited.

1494
01:32:03.786 --> 01:32:08.090
I just feel like watching
my toddler learn how to walk.

1495
01:32:09.792 --> 01:32:11.459
If I don't pay attention...

1496
01:32:11.627 --> 01:32:14.162
It's gonna crack its head open
on a chrome coffee table?

1497
01:32:14.630 --> 01:32:16.164
Exactly.

1498
01:32:18.366 --> 01:32:20.002
That's a feeling
I wouldn't trust.

1499
01:32:20.636 --> 01:32:22.004
It's just a test.

1500
01:32:22.871 --> 01:32:24.339
None of this matters yet.

1501
01:32:24.472 --> 01:32:26.308
it's gonna be a few weeks
before any orders

1502
01:32:26.474 --> 01:32:28.711
even maybe come in.
you know--

1503
01:32:35.884 --> 01:32:37.720
Is that what I think it is?

1504
01:32:38.186 --> 01:32:40.656
Fluid Concepts
and Creative Analogies.

1505
01:32:42.490 --> 01:32:43.692
Paid with a credit card.

1506
01:32:44.359 --> 01:32:45.861
We got our first order.
