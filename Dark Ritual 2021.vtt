- Well.

72
00:04:32.651 --> 00:04:34.619
I think we should increase
her dosage and see.

73
00:04:35.102 --> 00:04:36.172
It might help.

Gave me a call. and
when I went in.

99
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:27.645
it looked like the place could
have been abandoned

101
00:08:30.924 --> 00:08:32.753

- Huh.

106
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.761
Why did it take you so
long to notice?

107
00:08:42.625 --> 00:08:43.730
- I mean. I own the place. yeah.
sure.

108
00:08:44.627 --> 00:08:46.180
but I got other things going.
right?

109
00:08:47.043 --> 00:08:47.975
And for the most part.
these kids.

110
00:08:48.976 --> 00:08:50.150
as long as they don't burn
the place down.

111
00:08:50.771 --> 00:08:52.462
I feel lucky. you know?

112
00:08:53.325 --> 00:08:53.705
And these work-study kids.

113
00:08:54.913 --> 00:08:58.020
most of them pay their entire
lease all at once up front.

114
00:08:58.917 --> 00:09:00.194
So. you know.

115
00:09:01.402 --> 00:09:04.440
Didn't Brian tell you
about the grant?

116
00:09:06.131 --> 00:09:07.650
- No. he didn't mention a grant.

117
00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:11.551
but that would make sense.
though.

118
00:09:13.345 --> 00:09:17.108
- Anyway. I left everything
pretty much as it was.

119
00:09:18.281 --> 00:09:21.630
except for some minor remodeling
that I'm doing in there.

Could...

126
00:09:49.761 --> 00:09:51.280
Could Brian have been on drugs?

127
00:09:52.177 --> 00:09:53.351
- Not that I know of.

128
00:09:54.766 --> 00:09:57.631
This isn't like him. even if he
does live with other people.

129

And speaking of other people.

130

what are you gonna do with
all their stuff?

131
00:10:04.258 --> 00:10:07.572
- Well. I contacted their folks.

132
00:10:08.746 --> 00:10:10.299
Nobody's gotten back in
touch with me.

133
00:10:11.369 --> 00:10:12.266
You're the first.

134
00:10:14.786 --> 00:10:17.617
As far as their stuff. I do have
to make my money back.

135
00:10:18.272 --> 00:10:19.619
just like everybody else.

136
00:10:21.379 --> 00:10:22.863
- Guess I can understand that.

137
00:10:29.525 --> 00:10:31.596
Is it okay if I look
around a little bit?

138
00:10:37.395 --> 00:10:38.223
- Sure.

139
00:10:38.776 --> 00:10:39.811

00:15:24.406 --> 00:15:25.786
- One can only hope.

184
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.479
And who knows. I mean.
these kids.

185
00:15:29.411 --> 00:15:31.068
they get overseas
offers all the time.

186
00:15:32.138 --> 00:15:35.313
I mean. maybe Brian got one and
just jumped on it.

187
00:15:36.832 --> 00:15:40.077
- I mean. it's not like him to
just leave all of his crap.

188
00:15:45.082 --> 00:15:47.981
[unsettling music]

189
00:15:52.572 --> 00:15:54.746
- There once was a deer
in the forest.

190
00:15:55.368 --> 00:15:56.334
Summer was very. very hot.

191
00:15:57.335 --> 00:15:59.820
and in the heat. the deer
became very thirsty.

192
00:16:00.338 --> 00:16:00.821
[unsettling music]

193
00:16:01.926 --> 00:16:04.411
He found a small spring and
decided to take a drink.

194
00:16:05.274 --> 00:16:05.930
He noticed his
reflection in the water.

195
00:16:07.104 --> 00:16:10.348
and greatly admired the size and
the shape of his antlers.

196
00:16:11.832 --> 00:16:15.526
They were vast and ornate. and
oh so very pointed.

197
00:16:20.186 --> 00:16:21.773
- Jennifer. - Brian?

198
00:16:22.809 --> 00:16:24.397
- Jennifer. - Brian.
is that you?

199
00:16:25.846 --> 00:16:26.847
- As the deer contemplated
himself in the spring.

200
00:16:27.365 --> 00:16:28.677
a lion approached.

201
00:16:29.367 --> 00:16:30.196
Seeing the deer so distracted.

202
00:16:31.197 --> 00:16:33.337
the lion crouched to
spring upon the deer.

203
00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:36.754
The deer sensed the lion
immediately and took flight.

204
00:16:37.444 --> 00:16:38.100
The deer was very fast indeed.

205
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:42.622
and as long as the path
remained smooth and open.

206
00:16:43.968 --> 00:16:44.727
he remained a safe distance
away from the lion.

207
00:16:45.797 --> 00:16:48.145
- Brian. where have you been.
what are you doing?

208
00:16:48.628 --> 00:16:51.010
[tense music]

209
00:16:51.424 --> 00:16:52.011
- Go back.

210
00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:56.325
Don't come back to this house.
Jennifer!

211
00:16:58.776 --> 00:17:00.778
Go back!

212
00:17:02.193 --> 00:17:03.022
- Brian!

213
00:17:04.057 --> 00:17:04.989
Brian!

214
00:17:05.438 --> 00:17:07.715
Brian. Brian!

215
00:17:09.787 --> 00:17:10.615
Brian!

216
00:17:15.205 --> 00:17:17.346
[roaring]

217
00:17:18.623 --> 00:17:19.797
Brian. please!

218
00:17:36.607 --> 00:17:37.435
Brian?

219
00:17:50.138 --> 00:17:51.277
What the hell?

220
00:18:01.873 --> 00:18:03.427
Brian. is that you?

221
00:18:07.776 --> 00:18:10.089
Brian. what are you doing.
stop fooling around.

222
00:18:10.572 --> 00:18:12.091
- Come on. Sis.

223
00:18:12.643 --> 00:18:13.264
We can play catch.

224
00:18:13.954 --> 00:18:15.473
- No. no. no. can't be real.

225
00:18:16.164 --> 00:18:17.820
- Just you and me. - Brian.

226
00:18:18.304 --> 00:18:18.649
- Like old times.

227
00:18:19.167 --> 00:18:20.202
- Not real. stop.

228
00:18:20.858 --> 00:18:22.066
Not real. not real. no.

229
00:18:22.825 --> 00:18:23.792
This isn't real.
this isn't real.

230
00:18:24.551 --> 00:18:25.518
This isn't real.
this isn't real.

231
00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:27.520
It's not real. stop.

232
00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:30.592
Shut up. make it stop. - Now
what's wrong. Sis?

233
00:18:31.213 --> 00:18:31.524
- [Jennifer] Make it stop.

234
00:18:32.766 --> 00:18:34.492
- I told you not to come back
here. but you wouldn't listen.

235
00:18:35.183 --> 00:18:35.597
- Shut up. shut up. shut up.

236
00:18:36.494 --> 00:18:38.013
- Just like Mother told
you not to look.

237
00:18:38.634 --> 00:18:39.187
- [Jennifer] Make it stop.

238
00:18:39.808 --> 00:18:40.843
- But you looked anyway.

239
00:18:41.465 --> 00:18:42.121
- Make it stop. fuck you.

240
00:18:43.191 --> 00:18:45.676
- Now since you're here. we can
play catch. right?

241
00:18:46.849 --> 00:18:47.126
Right?

242
00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:50.163
- Fuck you. fuck you! -
Just like old times!

243
00:18:51.371 --> 00:18:53.580
Now Jennifer. you know
what Daddy would do

244
00:18:54.236 --> 00:18:55.720
if you didn't listen to him.

245
00:19:00.104 --> 00:19:03.245
But since he's dead. I'm gonna
cut you some slack.

246
00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:11.046
Now. come on over here and give
your big brother a hug.

247
00:19:22.022 --> 00:19:24.024
[suspenseful music]

248
00:19:24.715 --> 00:19:25.681
Jennifer. please listen to me!

249
00:19:26.337 --> 00:19:27.131
Don't. don't come back here!

250
00:19:27.821 --> 00:19:28.581
Please. promise me you won't!

251
00:19:29.582 --> 00:19:30.721
- No. no. no. no-- -
Promise me you won't!

252
00:19:31.308 --> 00:19:32.895
Jennifer. promise me!

253
00:19:33.241 --> 00:19:34.380
[shouts]

254
00:19:34.863 --> 00:19:35.174
- No! - Promise!

255
00:19:36.209 --> 00:19:38.315
Promise me you won't.
promise me you won't!

256
00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.765
[shouts]

257
00:19:42.905 --> 00:19:43.734
Jennifer!

258
00:19:44.562 --> 00:19:45.391
- No!

259
00:19:46.564 --> 00:19:48.359
Brian. I love you too!

260
00:19:52.605 --> 00:19:55.366
[phone vibrates]

261
00:20:04.099 --> 00:20:06.860
Oh shit. forgot to
call her back.

262
00:20:14.351 --> 00:20:15.248
- [Christine] Hi. Jennifer.
it's me.

263
00:20:16.284 --> 00:20:18.355
I know you probably had a
really rough day.

264
00:20:19.287 --> 00:20:19.977
and I probably
shouldn't have let you

265
00:20:20.633 --> 00:20:22.393
go to the house by yourself.

266
00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.154
But just call me back
when you get this.

267
00:20:26.259 --> 00:20:28.606
I wanted to know what the status
was on your brother.

268
00:20:29.055 --> 00:20:29.952
I love you.

269
00:20:33.749 --> 00:20:34.509
- [Brian] Help me. Jen.

270
00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:35.613
- No. no. no. no! - Help me!

271
00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:38.029
Please. I can't leave!

272
00:20:38.513 --> 00:20:41.170
[Brian screams]

273
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:47.625
[roaring]

274
00:20:48.005 --> 00:20:48.281
Jennifer!

275
00:20:48.833 --> 00:20:51.733
[dial tone blares]

276
00:20:57.325 --> 00:20:58.843
- Jennifer. it's me again.

277
00:20:59.706 --> 00:21:00.431
Please call me back soon.
sweetie.

278
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:03.434
I am really worried about Brian.

279
00:21:05.056 --> 00:21:07.473
And I just want you to know that

280
00:21:09.268 --> 00:21:12.340
I know we've had our
differences. but I love you.

281
00:21:13.099 --> 00:21:15.170
and you both mean so much to me.

282
00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:19.070
So just call when you can. okay.
honey?

283
00:21:22.039 --> 00:21:24.593
[solemn music]

284
00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:36.778
[phone rings]

285
00:21:43.336 --> 00:21:44.130
Jenn.

286
00:21:44.648 --> 00:21:45.718
- Hey. Aunt Chris.

287
00:21:46.891 --> 00:21:47.823
I'm sorry for calling
you so late.

288
00:21:48.859 --> 00:21:51.310
I just went to Brian's and
then I passed out.

289
00:21:51.758 --> 00:21:52.518
- It's okay.

290
00:21:53.139 --> 00:21:53.726
Have you heard anything?

291
00:21:54.658 --> 00:21:57.177
- No. that's what I
don't understand.

292
00:21:58.213 --> 00:21:59.352
I mean. he at least would
have packed a bag

293
00:22:00.042 --> 00:22:01.527
or taken some of his stuff.

294
00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:04.323
Especially if he was gonna
go for this long.

295
00:22:05.047 --> 00:22:06.877
- Well. you know. maybe he just.

296
00:22:07.947 --> 00:22:09.328
he got called out and he just
didn't have a chance

297
00:22:09.845 --> 00:22:10.018
to pack anything.

298
00:22:11.122 --> 00:22:12.883
- But he never would've left
without calling me.

299
00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:14.816
He's never left without
saying goodbye.

300
00:22:15.644 --> 00:22:18.267
- Yeah. but he was
really pissed.

301
00:22:18.992 --> 00:22:20.960
- Yeah. but more at you than me.

302
00:22:23.238 --> 00:22:25.827
- Look. Jen. we've
been over this.

303
00:22:27.035 --> 00:22:28.692
There is no way I could
have afforded

304
00:22:29.382 --> 00:22:30.970
to loan him that much money.

305
00:22:31.557 --> 00:22:31.798
And neither could you.

306
00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:33.524
- You could have co...

307
00:22:34.836 --> 00:22:36.493
You could have co-signed on a
loan or something.

308
00:22:37.114 --> 00:22:37.666
- No. I couldn't have.

309
00:22:38.771 --> 00:22:41.532
I would've liked to. but it
doesn't work like that.

310
00:22:42.464 --> 00:22:44.328
It is more complicated
than you think.

311
00:22:45.053 --> 00:22:47.331
- Then who was supposed to. who?

312
00:22:47.918 --> 00:22:49.126
Our parents are dead!

313
00:22:50.334 --> 00:22:53.130
You willingly took this on. but
you weren't willing to...

314
00:23:01.759 --> 00:23:02.588
I'm sorry.

315
00:23:07.109 --> 00:23:07.938
Sorry.

316
00:23:10.699 --> 00:23:11.873
That's not true.

317
00:23:14.082 --> 00:23:17.188
You took us in after all of
those years. after Mom and Dad.

318
00:23:19.812 --> 00:23:22.435
I'm sorry. this is just too much
to handle right now.

319
00:23:25.611 --> 00:23:29.166
Anyway. the landlord said that
he got a study grant.

320
00:23:29.718 --> 00:23:31.168
- Well. that's good.

321
00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:39.901
Look. Jen. I know that you and
your brother were.

322
00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:41.868
are really close.

323
00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:45.803
Especially since

324
00:23:47.115 --> 00:23:48.392
your whore mother

325
00:23:50.601 --> 00:23:53.880
killed my brother in cold blood!

326
00:23:54.329 --> 00:23:54.881
[gun fires]

327
00:23:55.503 --> 00:23:57.125
So brother for brother!

328
00:23:58.540 --> 00:23:59.955
Think the scales are even now.
don't you think?

329
00:24:00.404 --> 00:24:01.578
[gun cocks]

330
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:05.236
Especially since your
parents died.

331
00:24:07.066 --> 00:24:08.861
We just need to stay positive.

332
00:24:09.758 --> 00:24:10.069
Your brother is fine.

333
00:24:10.759 --> 00:24:13.244
He was mad at the both of us.

334
00:24:14.314 --> 00:24:17.283
and he just left on a trip
without letting us know.

335
00:24:18.526 --> 00:24:20.769
- Have you talked to Dr.
Katja lately?

336
00:24:21.701 --> 00:24:23.703
- No. why?

337
00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.396
- Because I keep seeing
all these things.

338
00:24:28.156 --> 00:24:30.330
hearing all these weird things.

339
00:24:32.712 --> 00:24:33.575
- Like what. baby?

340
00:24:35.508 --> 00:24:36.682
- Think I just keep having all
of these dreams about Brian.

341
00:24:37.821 --> 00:24:40.409
and they're not dreams. they're
more like nightmares.

342
00:24:45.414 --> 00:24:48.935
- Well. it's probably the
stress of the situation.

343
00:24:49.591 --> 00:24:50.799
Are you still on your meds?

344
00:24:51.144 --> 00:24:51.973
- Yes.

345
00:24:53.215 --> 00:24:54.389
But it's different.

346
00:24:55.528 --> 00:24:56.322
It's more real. it's not
like it was before.

347
00:24:57.185 --> 00:24:58.600
Like today. when I
was at Brian's.

348
00:24:59.532 --> 00:25:02.017
- Sweetie. your
brother is missing.

349
00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:06.297
and it's affecting you deeply.
as it should.

350
00:25:07.678 --> 00:25:09.473
You need to relax.
get some rest.

351
00:25:10.543 --> 00:25:12.614
Everything's gonna be find.
we're gonna find him.

352
00:25:19.966 --> 00:25:21.174
Maybe you're right. Aunt Chris.

353
00:25:22.072 --> 00:25:22.900
I don't know. it just
doesn't feel--

354
00:25:23.383 --> 00:25:24.350
- Now look. Jen.

355
00:25:24.937 --> 00:25:27.042
Get some rest now. okay?

356
00:25:28.319 --> 00:25:29.907
And I will talk to you tomorrow.

357
00:25:31.633 --> 00:25:32.220
And if you're still
having a rough time.

358
00:25:32.979 --> 00:25:34.533
we'll go and talk to Dr. Katja.

359
00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:36.638
Okay?

360
00:25:39.365 --> 00:25:40.159
I love you.

361
00:25:42.679 --> 00:25:42.955
- I love you.

362
00:25:44.163 --> 00:25:46.165
- [Christine] And call me if
there's any other news. okay?

363
00:25:48.098 --> 00:25:49.651
- Yes. ma'am. - Bye.

364
00:25:51.308 --> 00:25:52.309
- Yeah. bye.

365
00:26:13.399 --> 00:26:16.126
[phone vibrates]

366
00:26:20.924 --> 00:26:23.512
[gentle music]

367
00:26:24.513 --> 00:26:25.135
- [Waitress] Hi. how's it going?

368
00:26:25.653 --> 00:26:26.032
- Hey. what's up?

369
00:26:26.723 --> 00:26:27.240
- I'll be your waitress today.

370
00:26:28.172 --> 00:26:29.760
Can I start you off with
anything to drink?

371
00:26:30.243 --> 00:26:31.003
- Yes. please.

372
00:26:31.486 --> 00:26:32.211
Got some pop?

373
00:26:33.039 --> 00:26:33.833
- Yeah. - Tell you what.
let me just.

374
00:26:34.523 --> 00:26:34.731
let me just have some water.

375
00:26:35.766 --> 00:26:37.112
- Water. okay. I'll be
right back with that.

376
00:26:37.492 --> 00:26:38.320
- Okay.

377
00:26:45.673 --> 00:26:47.606
Hey. beautiful. how you doing?

378
00:26:48.089 --> 00:26:49.124
- Feel like hell.

379
00:26:49.538 --> 00:26:50.712
[chuckles]

380
00:26:51.333 --> 00:26:51.575
- Well. you look it too.

381
00:26:52.162 --> 00:26:53.715
- Always have the jokes.

382
00:26:57.788 --> 00:27:00.101
I'm doing all right for
the circumstances.

383
00:27:01.067 --> 00:27:03.000
- I knew by your tone
something was up.

384
00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:07.004
He's probably just in Peru
checking things out.

385
00:27:11.181 --> 00:27:13.010
- Don't you think he would've
told you that. though?

386
00:27:13.977 --> 00:27:14.253
- You know as well as I do

387
00:27:15.185 --> 00:27:15.944
Brian forgets the most
mundane things.

388
00:27:16.876 --> 00:27:17.636
like brushing his teeth
and eating dinner

389
00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.397
and telling people he's fled the
country for a month.

390
00:27:20.846 --> 00:27:21.674
- That's true.

391
00:27:22.261 --> 00:27:22.641
- Here's your water.

392
00:27:23.296 --> 00:27:24.159
Hi. welcome to Sunny's.

393
00:27:25.022 --> 00:27:26.368
Can I get you
something to drink?

394
00:27:26.817 --> 00:27:27.197
- Water. please.

395
00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:29.130
- [Waitress] Okay. I'll
be right back.

396
00:27:33.513 --> 00:27:34.514
- Thank you.

397
00:27:37.448 --> 00:27:40.831
I think there's something really
wrong with Brian. Ken.

398
00:27:41.211 --> 00:27:42.039
- Like?

399
00:27:43.282 --> 00:27:46.112
- I keep having these
crazy dreams

400
00:27:47.182 --> 00:27:49.598
where he's telling me not to go
back to the house.

401
00:27:50.461 --> 00:27:51.152
- [Kenneth] Wait.
your old house?

402
00:27:51.842 --> 00:27:52.256
Why would you even consider--

403
00:27:53.085 --> 00:27:54.569
- No. no. not our parents'
house.

404
00:27:55.328 --> 00:27:56.882
the house where he was staying.

405
00:27:58.262 --> 00:28:00.299
And it always ends the same.

406
00:28:00.817 --> 00:28:01.956
- How does it end?

407
00:28:02.853 --> 00:28:05.407
- He dies. if you can
call it that.

408
00:28:07.064 --> 00:28:08.617
- What do you mean?

409
00:28:11.275 --> 00:28:13.381
- Something grabs him.

410
00:28:14.451 --> 00:28:15.314
I know this sounds crazy.

411
00:28:15.935 --> 00:28:16.625
- Here's your other water.

412
00:28:16.971 --> 00:28:17.488
- Thanks.

413
00:28:18.455 --> 00:28:19.559
- Do y'all wanna order
something to eat?

414
00:28:20.181 --> 00:28:20.560
- No. I'm fine. thank you.

415
00:28:21.734 --> 00:28:23.529
- Come on. you're gonna let a
hungry man eat by himself?

416
00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:24.081
- Pizza?

417
00:28:25.013 --> 00:28:26.359
- I'll just have
whatever he's having.

418
00:28:26.946 --> 00:28:27.395
- Two veggies please.

419
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:28.741
- All right. I'll have that
right out for y'all.

420
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:30.018
- Thank you.

421
00:28:32.711 --> 00:28:36.956
Look. Jen. are you sure it
isn't just stress?

422
00:28:37.577 --> 00:28:38.889
- What hallucinations?

423
00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:42.237
- I'm telling you
something's really wrong!

424
00:28:43.273 --> 00:28:44.101
- Look. just calm down.

425
00:28:44.999 --> 00:28:46.828
All right. I'm worried
about him too.

426
00:28:48.657 --> 00:28:50.452
He's like a brother to me.

427
00:28:55.043 --> 00:28:58.909
- Yesterday. when I was at his
house packing up his stuff.

428
00:29:00.359 --> 00:29:03.017
I could've swore I saw him
standing there. reaching out.

429
00:29:03.638 --> 00:29:05.467
and saying. "Help me."

430
00:29:11.335 --> 00:29:12.543
- You still taking those?

431
00:29:13.303 --> 00:29:14.822
- Yeah. they help keep me calm.

432
00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:19.688
- Look. Jen. I don't know what
you want me to do.

433
00:29:21.449 --> 00:29:22.139
- I want you to help me.

434
00:29:23.382 --> 00:29:25.487
And not just for me. because
he's your best friend. Kenneth.

435
00:29:26.454 --> 00:29:27.282
- Look. just because he's
my best friend

436
00:29:28.318 --> 00:29:29.422
doesn't mean I have to listen
to some crazy talk

437
00:29:30.009 --> 00:29:31.045
about him being dead.

438
00:29:36.775 --> 00:29:38.846
I didn't mean crazy like that.

439
00:29:41.434 --> 00:29:43.712
- It's just a gut feeling
that I have. okay?

440
00:29:44.886 --> 00:29:45.300
- Well. you also had
a gut feeling

441
00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:48.476
about me marrying Angela
Counter from junior year.

442
00:29:49.063 --> 00:29:49.857
See where that ended up.

443
00:29:50.547 --> 00:29:51.306
- Please. Ken. you're the--

444
00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:52.549
[phone vibrates]

445
00:29:52.998 --> 00:29:53.826
- Jen! - What?

446
00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.277
- Leave now. I'm being watched.

447
00:29:57.174 --> 00:29:58.348
You can't leave.
you'll get trapped.

448
00:29:58.969 --> 00:30:00.281
Here are the instructions.

449
00:30:01.213 --> 00:30:02.352
If you find this. please.

450
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:05.286
[Brian screams]

451
00:30:05.907 --> 00:30:06.874
- Whoa. whoa. what is it?

452
00:30:07.564 --> 00:30:08.876
- Look at the last message.

453
00:30:10.774 --> 00:30:13.190
- It's a text message from
Brian. but it's empty.

454
00:30:14.364 --> 00:30:15.710
- Let me see it.

455
00:30:18.989 --> 00:30:20.404
It was a video
message from Brian.

456
00:30:21.612 --> 00:30:24.581
He was screaming. and there were
all these horrible sounds.

457
00:30:26.479 --> 00:30:28.067
- Look. Jennifer.

458
00:30:30.104 --> 00:30:31.277
Get ahold of yourself.

459
00:30:31.899 --> 00:30:33.728
There's nothing wrong.

460
00:30:35.661 --> 00:30:36.800
- I'll be right back.

461
00:30:47.052 --> 00:30:49.261
Jen. you need to get
ahold of yourself.

462
00:30:50.089 --> 00:30:52.471
He left on a trip.
he was pissed.

463
00:30:53.127 --> 00:30:54.438
Everything's gonna be fine.

464
00:31:00.617 --> 00:31:02.861

[gasps]

466
00:31:07.106 --> 00:31:10.109
Man. I'm really
starting to lose it.

467
00:31:12.353 --> 00:31:13.872
No. no. no. no. - Jennifer.
please help me!

468
00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:14.631
- No. no. no!

469
00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:18.497
No. no. no. no. it's not real.
it's not real. not real.

470
00:31:19.049 --> 00:31:20.292
No. no. no. no. no.

471
00:31:21.362 --> 00:31:23.812
This isn't real. this isn't
real. this isn't real.

472
00:31:24.123 --> 00:31:24.952
- Jen.

473
00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:26.850
- This isn't real.
this isn't real.

474
00:31:27.609 --> 00:31:29.025
This isn't real.
this isn't real.

475
00:31:29.508 --> 00:31:30.716
This isn't real.

476
00:31:31.165 --> 00:31:31.441
This isn't real.

477
00:31:31.993 --> 00:31:33.684
- [Brian] Help. Jen.

478
00:31:34.996 --> 00:31:37.205
Jennifer. look at me.

479
00:31:38.758 --> 00:31:41.313
- This isn't real. - Look at me!

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:49.804
[gentle alt rock music]

481
00:31:57.570 --> 00:31:58.330
- Hey!

482
00:31:58.882 --> 00:31:59.848
Jen. are you okay?

483
00:32:01.471 --> 00:32:02.127
Jennifer. you in there?

484
00:32:02.541 --> 00:32:03.542
[knocking]

[tense music]

486
00:32:06.614 --> 00:32:07.995
Hey. come on. answer me.
are you all right?

487
00:32:08.788 --> 00:32:10.342
- Why are you doing this to me?

488
00:32:13.552 --> 00:32:14.863
- I don't have time.

489
00:32:15.899 --> 00:32:19.627
Please. I need you to come
back to the house.

490
00:32:21.767 --> 00:32:22.319
- But you said that--

491
00:32:22.975 --> 00:32:24.114
- He's right. Jennifer.

492
00:32:25.702 --> 00:32:26.082
You have to go help him.

493
00:32:26.979 --> 00:32:28.325
Don't let him down like
we did before.

494
00:32:28.912 --> 00:32:29.913
This time it's real.

495
00:32:30.949 --> 00:32:34.953
You know what. maybe. maybe we
did let him down.

496
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:37.472
Maybe it is our fault.

497
00:32:38.577 --> 00:32:41.097
Maybe whatever he had to do
for the grant he got

498
00:32:41.752 --> 00:32:42.477
got him a little trouble.

499
00:32:43.478 --> 00:32:45.618
Maybe. maybe there wasn't
a grant at all.

500
00:32:46.688 --> 00:32:48.725
Did you ever think about that?
- No. don't. don't.

501
00:32:49.415 --> 00:32:52.039
- Maybe I did have the money.

502
00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:53.626
but I wanted to
punish him a little

503
00:32:54.489 --> 00:32:58.010
for what his mother did
to our family.

504
00:32:59.632 --> 00:33:02.670
You know. there are a lot of
questions to answer.

505
00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.707
- A lot of questions that
won't be answered

506
00:33:06.639 --> 00:33:09.090
unless you follow
through to the end.

507
00:33:09.573 --> 00:33:10.781
Right. Jennifer?

508
00:33:11.506 --> 00:33:13.612
- Follow through. - To the end.

509
00:33:15.096 --> 00:33:18.306

the only way.

Hey. what was that back there?

531

- You wouldn't even believe
me if I told you.

- [Kenneth] Why don't you
try to explain it?

533
00:34:27.996 --> 00:34:28.928
- Because you'd think that I'm
just some fucking crazy bitch

534
00:34:29.652 --> 00:34:29.895
that's freaking out over nothing

535
00:34:30.896 --> 00:34:33.692
when there's something
actually fucking wrong!

00:34:34.382 --> 00:34:36.902
- [shushes] Jen. - There is.

537
00:34:37.627 --> 00:34:39.629
- It's okay. it's gonna be okay.

538
00:34:43.219 --> 00:34:45.911
Look. look. if you want me to go
in there with you. I will.

539
00:34:47.119 --> 00:34:48.947
But we're only gonna get your
brother's gear and get out.

540
00:34:49.397 --> 00:34:49.570
Nothing else.

541
00:34:50.605 --> 00:34:51.226
- But we gotta get-- - No.
what we have to do

542
00:34:52.193 --> 00:34:52.918
is get your brother's
stuff out of there

543
00:34:53.574 --> 00:34:54.815
before that house gets sold.

544
00:34:55.748 --> 00:34:55.989
- [Jennifer] What if
there's something

545
00:34:56.577 --> 00:34:57.612
actually wrong. Kenneth?

546
00:34:58.958 --> 00:35:00.443
- Let me be the judge of that.

547
00:35:01.961 --> 00:35:02.790
Do you trust me?

548
00:35:04.067 --> 00:35:05.379
Do you trust me?

549
00:35:07.001 --> 00:35:08.313
Do you trust me?

550
00:35:16.148 --> 00:35:17.115
It's gonna be okay.

551
00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:22.672
Look. let me drive. okay?

552
00:35:23.638 --> 00:35:25.261
Just leave it here.
we'll get it later.

553
00:35:25.847 --> 00:35:26.814
We'll get it later.

554
00:35:32.751 --> 00:35:35.202
Listen. just calm down. okay?

555
00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:37.238
Breathe.

556
00:35:38.446 --> 00:35:40.483
- [Jennifer] There it is.

557
00:35:43.348 --> 00:35:44.556
- It doesn't look so bad.

558
00:35:46.627 --> 00:35:48.870
For a house that's supposed to
be really messed up.

559
00:36:04.817 --> 00:36:05.853
- What are you doing? - Nothing.

560
00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:08.062
Just grabbing something.

561
00:36:08.683 --> 00:36:09.063
- Why are you taking that

562
00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:10.409
if you don't think
anything's wrong?

563
00:36:11.583 --> 00:36:14.379
- [Kenneth] Cause sometimes
things go bump in the night.

564
00:36:19.729 --> 00:36:20.454
- What now?

565
00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.594
- Nothing. nothing.

566
00:36:23.457 --> 00:36:24.492
Where's the landlord.

567
00:36:25.666 --> 00:36:27.737
- I walked here. it's healthier.

568
00:36:28.876 --> 00:36:29.773
You should try it.

569
00:36:30.981 --> 00:36:31.430
You might live longer.

570
00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:33.121
- Jesus. man. don't do that.

571
00:36:34.019 --> 00:36:34.537
- What are you. like.
I don't know.

572
00:36:35.572 --> 00:36:38.265
scared something's gonna pop
out and get you?

573
00:36:39.231 --> 00:36:40.577
Booga booga booga? [chuckles]

574
00:36:41.682 --> 00:36:43.925
- It's just when people
materialized out of nowhere.

575
00:36:44.478 --> 00:36:45.306
You know-- - Listen.

576
00:36:46.273 --> 00:36:48.240
I didn't mean to scare you.
all right?

577
00:36:48.758 --> 00:36:49.586
You'll be okay.

578
00:36:51.761 --> 00:36:52.520
[door closes]

579
00:36:53.176 --> 00:36:53.694
- Why are you so jumpy?

580
00:36:54.315 --> 00:36:54.557
Earlier you were all like.

581
00:36:55.558 --> 00:36:56.386
ah. there's nothing wrong
with that house.

582
00:36:56.904 --> 00:36:57.491
- I am not jumpy.

583
00:36:58.457 --> 00:36:59.286
- [Jennifer] Bullshit
you're not jumpy.

584
00:37:00.356 --> 00:37:00.873
- [Kenneth] Look. I'm not
afraid of that guy.

585
00:37:01.943 --> 00:37:04.222
Maybe you're afraid of him. and
you're projecting.

586
00:37:05.084 --> 00:37:05.430
You're projecting
your fear on me.

587
00:37:06.293 --> 00:37:07.017
- Yeah. so as soon as
you saw him.

588
00:37:07.915 --> 00:37:08.226
that's why you almost
shit yourself.

589
00:37:08.812 --> 00:37:09.296
- I did not shit myself.

590
00:37:10.193 --> 00:37:10.814
Might have peed a little.
though.

591
00:37:11.298 --> 00:37:12.126
Hey. wait up!

592
00:37:14.956 --> 00:37:15.785
Sir?

593
00:37:17.027 --> 00:37:18.650
How long have you
owned this place?

594
00:37:20.272 --> 00:37:22.101
- For a while. - How
long's a while?

595
00:37:24.172 --> 00:37:25.726
[groans]

596
00:37:26.347 --> 00:37:28.315
- [Steve] About 10 years.

597
00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:33.975
- Has anything like this
ever happened before?

598
00:37:35.149 --> 00:37:37.979
- I mean. I've had a few
people up and leave.

599
00:37:38.842 --> 00:37:42.363
but no. never
anything like this.

600
00:37:44.158 --> 00:37:44.848
- And you said before that you
have to make money

601
00:37:45.953 --> 00:37:48.542
just like everybody. like you
have done this before.

602
00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:51.614
- Well. there was this one kid.

603
00:37:53.374 --> 00:37:55.687
Yeah. when I was going
through his stuff.

604
00:37:56.377 --> 00:37:59.277
I found a few keys of cocaine

605
00:38:00.623 --> 00:38:03.004
parsed away in
two-liter soda bottles.

606
00:38:05.938 --> 00:38:08.044
Let's just say it more
than took care

607
00:38:08.631 --> 00:38:10.909
of his outstanding rent.

608
00:38:12.738 --> 00:38:14.188
Know what I mean?

609
00:38:17.191 --> 00:38:19.297
So will this be your
last trip here?

610
00:38:20.505 --> 00:38:21.678
- Yeah. I mean. with
Kenneth here.

611
00:38:22.576 --> 00:38:24.198
we should be able to get
everything out.

612
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:25.268
- Well that's good.

613
00:38:26.476 --> 00:38:29.548
cause I'd really like to get
this place cleaned up tomorrow.

614
00:38:30.791 --> 00:38:32.068
and get this place ready to
rent again. you know?

615
00:38:33.241 --> 00:38:36.106
- Yes sir. I guarantee we're
gonna get all his stuff out.

616
00:38:37.556 --> 00:38:38.764
- Excellent. excuse me.

617
00:38:40.663 --> 00:38:42.665
[sighs]

618
00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.909
Now my favorite TV show's
coming on. you see?

619
00:38:47.704 --> 00:38:49.534
And I really hate to
miss an episode.

620
00:38:51.087 --> 00:38:55.091
So if you guys need anything.
you just yell.

621
00:38:56.782 --> 00:38:57.576
- Will do.

622
00:39:04.618 --> 00:39:05.377
See what I mean?

623
00:39:05.998 --> 00:39:06.240
- About the landlord?

624
00:39:07.275 --> 00:39:07.690
- [Jennifer] Yeah. the
drug-running landlord.

625
00:39:08.863 --> 00:39:09.968
- Yeah. pretty creepy as far as
landlords are concerned.

626
00:39:11.038 --> 00:39:12.902
- Okay. first thing I saw
was on his computer.

627
00:39:13.247 --> 00:39:14.697
[laughs]

628
00:39:15.767 --> 00:39:17.493
- One of these. now this is in
pristine condition.

629
00:39:18.425 --> 00:39:20.012
You can see that it's in
fantastic shape.

630
00:39:20.806 --> 00:39:22.946
This is a ceremonial ax.
or a bot.

631
00:39:24.051 --> 00:39:27.123
- What's so scary about some
ancient Mayan artifacts?

632
00:39:28.055 --> 00:39:30.057
It's pretty right on the
point with Brian.

633
00:39:31.507 --> 00:39:33.025
- What the hell. that was not
there two days ago.

634
00:39:33.716 --> 00:39:35.545
- Uh-huh. and what was there?

635
00:39:37.444 --> 00:39:37.823
- It was Brian.

636
00:39:38.893 --> 00:39:41.517
- And let me guess. he was
asking us for help.

637
00:39:43.208 --> 00:39:45.244
- [Jennifer] No. he was
asking us to leave now.

638
00:39:46.107 --> 00:39:48.386
- Well. I suggest we do
what he said.

639
00:39:50.111 --> 00:39:51.527
- [Jennifer] I don't understand.

640
00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:56.394
- Look.

641
00:40:03.055 --> 00:40:04.712
Hey. I'm gonna go to
the bathroom.

642
00:40:05.679 --> 00:40:07.439
Man. this room stinks.

643
00:40:09.959 --> 00:40:11.409
- [Jennifer] Hey Ken?

644
00:40:11.754 --> 00:40:12.548
- Yeah?

645
00:40:13.549 --> 00:40:14.550
- Maybe you're right.

646
00:40:15.516 --> 00:40:16.931
Maybe I'm just freaking out.

647
00:40:18.243 --> 00:40:20.348
- Jennifer. it's gonna
be all right.

648
00:40:21.073 --> 00:40:22.730
Let's just get out of here ASAP.

649
00:40:47.893 --> 00:40:50.378
[phone rings]

650
00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:55.280
- Hello?

651
00:40:55.901 --> 00:40:57.455
- Hey. Chris. it's Kenny.

652
00:40:58.076 --> 00:40:59.077
- Hey. Kenneth. long time.

653
00:41:00.181 --> 00:41:03.012
- Yeah. you know. Brian was
kinda pissed. and...

654
00:41:04.392 --> 00:41:05.704
Well. anyway. speaking of Brian.

655
00:41:06.567 --> 00:41:07.913
I'm at his place with Jennifer.
and--

656
00:41:08.535 --> 00:41:09.950
- Did you find anything?

657
00:41:10.433 --> 00:41:10.744
- Not really.

658
00:41:11.848 --> 00:41:14.368
It doesn't look like anybody's
been here for months.

659
00:41:14.989 --> 00:41:16.197
The place is a total mess.

660
00:41:16.888 --> 00:41:18.165
- Shit. - Look. don't worry.

661
00:41:18.786 --> 00:41:20.029
We're gonna keep looking.

662
00:41:23.377 --> 00:41:25.793
But Chris. I'm really getting
worried about Jen.

663
00:41:26.725 --> 00:41:28.624
I think this is all
going to her head.

664
00:41:29.763 --> 00:41:30.211
I think she had another
episode today.

665
00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:31.419
We were having lunch
at Sunny's--

666
00:41:32.282 --> 00:41:33.318
- Do you know if she
has her pills?

667
00:41:34.353 --> 00:41:36.494
- Yeah. I'm pretty sure she
does have them.

668
00:41:38.185 --> 00:41:39.876
- Okay. what address are you at?

669
00:41:40.532 --> 00:41:43.639
- 4321 Sans Point Avenue.

670
00:41:45.675 --> 00:41:46.504
Yeah. it's my cell.

671
00:41:47.366 --> 00:41:49.023
I'll call you if
anything changes.

672
00:41:50.162 --> 00:41:50.956
Oh. Chris.

673
00:41:53.027 --> 00:41:54.270
Can you please just give
Jennifer a call.

674
00:41:55.133 --> 00:41:56.721
just to make sure
she's all right?

675
00:41:57.342 --> 00:41:58.999
- Okay. thanks. Kenneth.

676
00:42:01.415 --> 00:42:03.451
- No problem. thank you.

677
00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:10.320
[ominous music]

678
00:42:10.907 --> 00:42:12.978
- No. really. thanks.

679
00:42:14.014 --> 00:42:14.842
- Chris?

680
00:42:15.843 --> 00:42:16.154
What the hell?

681
00:42:17.189 --> 00:42:18.466
- You know I really appreciate
you helping me out

682
00:42:19.088 --> 00:42:20.814
with them like this. Ken.

683
00:42:21.539 --> 00:42:22.056
I need all the help I can get.

684
00:42:22.643 --> 00:42:24.058
- Whoa. whoa. hold up.

685
00:42:24.749 --> 00:42:26.440
You're like a mother to them.

686
00:42:26.854 --> 00:42:27.303
To me. even.

687
00:42:28.166 --> 00:42:30.789
- Well. that was then.
this is now.

688
00:42:34.482 --> 00:42:35.518
- The fuck?

689
00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:39.004
The fuck? [chuckles]

690
00:42:39.626 --> 00:42:40.558
Get ahold of yourself.

691
00:42:41.179 --> 00:42:43.008
What the fuck was that?

692
00:42:45.804 --> 00:42:47.806
Hey. somebody's in here!

693
00:42:48.255 --> 00:42:49.049
Who's that?

694
00:42:55.538 --> 00:42:57.160
What the fuck?

695
00:42:59.715 --> 00:43:01.579
[screams]

696
00:43:02.027 --> 00:43:03.373
Excuse me. Miss.

697
00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:12.279
- Oh god.

698
00:43:14.039 --> 00:43:15.282
Please help me.

699
00:43:23.152 --> 00:43:24.049
Get out.

700
00:43:24.498 --> 00:43:25.499
Get out now.

701
00:43:25.844 --> 00:43:27.535
[screams]

702
00:43:27.846 --> 00:43:28.675
Help me!

[growling] [crunching]

704
00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:40.376
- What the fuck!

705

[screams]

706
00:44:02.225 --> 00:44:03.054
Bri?

707
00:44:07.575 --> 00:44:08.576
Is that you?

708
00:44:10.889 --> 00:44:11.683
Brian?

709
00:44:13.409 --> 00:44:14.237
Brian.

710
00:44:17.206 --> 00:44:20.105
[foreboding music]

711
00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:24.178
- Ah. stop worrying about it.
Jennifer.

712
00:44:25.248 --> 00:44:28.389
It's a stupid artifact. like
a piece of a wall.

713
00:44:32.359 --> 00:44:33.809
Or something like that.

714
00:44:51.550 --> 00:44:51.896
- Okay. Brian?

715
00:44:53.035 --> 00:44:54.692
We're back at the hotel room
near the excavation site.

716
00:44:55.693 --> 00:44:58.592
and this is. I don't even
know where to begin.

717
00:44:59.904 --> 00:45:00.145
Let's start over here. okay?

718
00:45:00.801 --> 00:45:01.975
We've got some photographs.

719
00:45:02.458 --> 00:45:02.976
[TV chatters]

720
00:45:04.011 --> 00:45:06.393
- Hey guys. can you turn the
TV down. please?

721
00:45:13.227 --> 00:45:14.539
Seriously. guys!

722
00:45:15.436 --> 00:45:17.197
- You guys need something?

723
00:45:18.405 --> 00:45:20.545
- Christ. this always happens.

724
00:45:21.063 --> 00:45:22.581
Need my own place.

725
00:45:24.066 --> 00:45:27.241
- Of some drawings actually on
the sides of the temple.

726
00:45:28.208 --> 00:45:29.796
Now I will show some
closeups of these later.

727
00:45:30.797 --> 00:45:31.556
but these things are
absolutely amazing.

728
00:45:32.591 --> 00:45:35.663
They seem to indicate that
what we've stumbled on

729
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:40.599
is some sort of rogue
sect of believers

730
00:45:41.497 --> 00:45:42.981
who followed the Mayan
deity Pach-We.

731
00:45:44.017 --> 00:45:45.950
Now that translates. very
roughly of course.

732
00:45:46.467 --> 00:45:47.089
to Flesh Eater.

733
00:45:48.159 --> 00:45:53.164
Now these pictures also show
some sort of ceremony

734
00:45:54.613 --> 00:45:55.407
that they conducted. some sort
of sacrificial ceremony.

735
00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:57.616
[tapping] [chanting]

736
00:45:58.548 --> 00:46:00.447
You know. we also found
some metal pieces.

737
00:46:01.482 --> 00:46:03.450
which we also believe are
part of the ceremony.

738
00:46:04.416 --> 00:46:05.763
And this is complete
conjecture on our part.

739
00:46:06.694 --> 00:46:07.661
but I think maybe
they're even using

740
00:46:08.489 --> 00:46:09.939
some sort of tinfoil hats.
right?

741
00:46:10.284 --> 00:46:10.975
[laughs]

742
00:46:11.423 --> 00:46:11.907
I'm kidding.

743
00:46:12.562 --> 00:46:13.494
Now. interestingly enough.

744
00:46:14.357 --> 00:46:15.669
you'll notice that
the victims here

745
00:46:16.843 --> 00:46:20.260
are having their hearts drawn or
pulled out of their body.

746
00:46:21.261 --> 00:46:22.814
Now we're not sure. it
could be a metaphor.

747
00:46:23.746 --> 00:46:25.196
it could be some sort of
actual parasite.

748
00:46:26.266 --> 00:46:28.095
But what we do think is. you'll
notice these lines

749
00:46:29.234 --> 00:46:30.788
around the victims' heads. or
the sacrificees' heads.

750
00:46:31.789 --> 00:46:33.169
and we believe that
indicates that they were

751
00:46:33.929 --> 00:46:35.482
in some sort of ecstatic state.

752
00:46:36.586 --> 00:46:41.281
experiencing some form of
almost mental trance.

753
00:46:43.421 --> 00:46:46.458
According to these drawings-- -
Nix the ceremonial ax.

754
00:46:46.907 --> 00:46:48.460
Item number 215.

755
00:46:49.461 --> 00:46:50.704
- You can see that it's in
fantastic shape.

756
00:46:51.878 --> 00:46:54.984
This is a ceremonial ax. or a
bot. that they would use.

757
00:46:55.847 --> 00:46:56.227
Now it looks like in
the drawings

758
00:46:57.435 --> 00:47:00.852
they would somehow draw these
creatures out of some sort.

759
00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:04.338
And then. bam. they'd just go
ahead and chop it right there.

760
00:47:05.167 --> 00:47:07.307
and hit it as hard
as they could.

761
00:47:08.342 --> 00:47:08.964
And that would be some part
of the ceremony.

762
00:47:09.896 --> 00:47:11.414
Now we also found--
[moaning on TV]

763
00:47:12.001 --> 00:47:13.382
- God damn it. really?

764
00:47:15.108 --> 00:47:16.040
Guys!

765
00:47:17.696 --> 00:47:18.525
What the hell?

766

[tense music]

769
00:47:38.821 --> 00:47:40.961
[beeping]

770
00:47:43.239 --> 00:47:44.206
- Here's the piece
de resistance.

771
00:47:45.138 --> 00:47:49.452
We have an actual
fossilized human heart.

772
00:47:50.937 --> 00:47:51.834
I know. I know. I couldn't
believe it either at first.

773
00:47:52.524 --> 00:47:52.973
[groaning] - What was that?

774
00:47:54.147 --> 00:47:55.355
- [Professor] I was actually
thinking about boxing it up

775
00:47:56.011 --> 00:47:57.564
in a giant Valentine's box.

776
00:48:00.739 --> 00:48:03.259
- Great. this guy just spills
his stuff and leaves.

777
00:48:04.295 --> 00:48:05.123
Fuck this guy.

778
00:48:07.125 --> 00:48:07.919
Steve!

779
00:48:12.303 --> 00:48:13.131

Damn it. Jennifer. get
ahold of yourself.

Ken!

785
00:48:46.475 --> 00:48:46.682
What did you do. did you--

786
00:48:47.717 --> 00:48:48.546
- [Brian] Yeah. man. just
put it over there.

787
00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:49.788
- Fall in.

788
00:48:53.792 --> 00:48:54.000
Brian?

789
00:48:55.001 --> 00:48:57.175
- Dude. did you see that
next-door neighbor?

790
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.935
- No. why?

791
00:48:58.866 --> 00:49:01.593
- Dude. smoking hot. I'd
love to just...

792
00:49:06.322 --> 00:49:07.979
- I'm sorry. Jennifer.

793
00:49:11.949 --> 00:49:13.709
- No. no. no. no. no.

794
00:49:22.269 --> 00:49:23.581
[laughs]

795
00:49:24.271 --> 00:49:25.963
What are you sorry for. Brian?

796
00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:29.932
God damn you. what are
you sorry for?

797
00:49:31.313 --> 00:49:33.384
[thunder rumbles]

798
00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:34.833
- [Cory] Hey. is that it?

799
00:49:35.524 --> 00:49:37.008
Or is there more in the truck?

800
00:49:43.118 --> 00:49:44.291
- Brian. you okay?

801
00:49:45.948 --> 00:49:47.087
- Holy shit.

802
00:49:47.536 --> 00:49:48.399
- Yeah. why?

803
00:49:50.918 --> 00:49:52.644
- You look like you saw a ghost.

804
00:49:56.786 --> 00:49:58.685
- Could've sworn I just
saw my sister.

805
00:50:01.481 --> 00:50:03.207
- [Elizabeth] Sure you're okay?

806
00:50:03.793 --> 00:50:04.311
- Nothing. I'm fine.

807
00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:08.246
I'm just tired from the move and
all the research work.

808
00:50:08.902 --> 00:50:10.145
- You know what you need?

809
00:50:11.491 --> 00:50:12.664
- Some of that new neighbor
action. [chuckles]

810
00:50:13.251 --> 00:50:14.666
Know what I'm saying?

811
00:50:15.012 --> 00:50:15.771
What?

812
00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:16.841
I'm just saying.

813
00:50:17.911 --> 00:50:18.360
Come on. man. let's get the
rest of the stuff

814
00:50:19.395 --> 00:50:21.087
out of the truck and kick back
and have a couple.

815
00:50:21.639 --> 00:50:24.228
[foreboding music]

816
00:50:24.883 --> 00:50:26.471
- Yeah. yeah. sounds good.

817
00:50:27.921 --> 00:50:30.751
- Just remember. the
offer still stands.

818
00:50:32.063 --> 00:50:33.547
Whenever you want.

819
00:50:38.863 --> 00:50:40.554
[door closes]

820
00:50:40.899 --> 00:50:41.693
- Brian!

821
00:50:42.591 --> 00:50:45.835
I'm right here!

822
00:50:46.146 --> 00:50:46.974
Brian!

823
00:50:49.184 --> 00:50:49.977
Brian!

824
00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:52.428
I'm right here!

825
00:50:53.774 --> 00:50:56.777
Brian. I'm right--

826
00:50:57.261 --> 00:50:58.779
[keys clicking]

827
00:50:59.125 --> 00:50:59.953
Here?

828
00:51:07.581 --> 00:51:12.586
What the?

829
00:51:16.901 --> 00:51:17.729
Brian!

830
00:51:19.076 --> 00:51:21.112
Brian. Brian!

831
00:51:22.182 --> 00:51:22.665
- Hey. what's up?

832
00:51:23.321 --> 00:51:23.666
- [Jennifer] Oh. thank god.

833
00:51:24.391 --> 00:51:26.531
- Hey. how's it going? - Shit.

834
00:51:27.153 --> 00:51:28.395
- I don't mind. actually.

835
00:51:30.673 --> 00:51:31.916
- Kim. still?

836
00:51:33.366 --> 00:51:38.198
- Did you know that this ax was
used for sacrifice

837
00:51:38.819 --> 00:51:40.097
to a Mayan god?

838
00:51:41.063 --> 00:51:41.995
- Ugh. so scary.

839
00:51:42.892 --> 00:51:43.479
- They also used to
cut off the skin

840
00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:46.482
and hang it up as a
safeguard for the god.

841
00:51:48.622 --> 00:51:50.141
- Way too much information.

842
00:51:53.524 --> 00:51:54.180
- You're such a nerd.

843
00:51:54.801 --> 00:51:56.458
- Yeah. but you like it.

844
00:51:56.906 --> 00:51:57.321
- Sometimes.

845
00:51:57.942 --> 00:51:59.944
- You think it's sexy.

846
00:52:00.841 --> 00:52:02.326
- Oh yeah.

847
00:52:06.916 --> 00:52:07.986
- What the fuck?

848
00:52:12.094 --> 00:52:14.234
- Hey. sorry. guys. am
I interrupting?

849
00:52:15.822 --> 00:52:17.168
- No. not at all. what's up?

850
00:52:17.824 --> 00:52:18.135
- [Cory] Not much. man.

851
00:52:18.859 --> 00:52:19.964
Well. what are you working on?

852
00:52:20.896 --> 00:52:22.208
- Well. currently
cataloging an ancient ax

853
00:52:23.001 --> 00:52:24.900
from the city of Kaminal Juy'u.

854
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:26.557
- Kamina what?

855
00:52:27.972 --> 00:52:29.525
- Kaminal Juy'u. it's
a Mayan city.

856
00:52:30.595 --> 00:52:32.735
in the valley of what is now
modern day Guatemala.

857
00:52:34.254 --> 00:52:34.496
- You know what. I'll let
you guys talk.

858
00:52:35.117 --> 00:52:36.705
I'm gonna take a shower.

859
00:52:40.916 --> 00:52:42.918
- So how do you end up with
crazy Guatemalan axes?

860
00:52:43.815 --> 00:52:45.127
Sounds a lot cooler
than med school.

861
00:52:46.024 --> 00:52:46.508
- Yeah. well.
eventually you and Liz

862
00:52:47.543 --> 00:52:47.888
are gonna be making a lot more
money than I will.

863
00:52:48.993 --> 00:52:50.339
so I wouldn't get too suckered
in by all this stuff.

864
00:52:50.719 --> 00:52:51.478
Trust me.

865
00:52:52.238 --> 00:52:52.445
I've seen some pretty weird shit

866
00:52:53.204 --> 00:52:54.585
over the past couple years. man.

867
00:52:57.277 --> 00:52:58.036
Seriously weird.

868
00:53:00.763 --> 00:53:01.247
Anyway. when we were younger.

869
00:53:02.248 --> 00:53:03.076
my sister and I would dig
in the backyard

870
00:53:04.008 --> 00:53:05.182
like we were a couple of
treasure hunters.

871
00:53:05.872 --> 00:53:07.701
- [Cory] [chuckles] Really?

872
00:53:08.081 --> 00:53:08.323
- Yeah.

873
00:53:09.013 --> 00:53:09.220
I remember I found this rock

874
00:53:10.187 --> 00:53:12.085
with a piece of fossil
embedded in it.

875
00:53:13.983 --> 00:53:14.984
Thought that was the
coolest thing.

876
00:53:15.502 --> 00:53:17.021
- I remember that.

877
00:53:18.988 --> 00:53:19.920
- I researched for days
trying to figure out

878
00:53:20.404 --> 00:53:20.783
what it was. too.

879
00:53:21.957 --> 00:53:24.097
And then when I finally did. I
remember I ran up to her.

880
00:53:24.856 --> 00:53:25.961
and I yelled. it's an ammonite!

881
00:53:26.272 --> 00:53:28.343
[laughs]

882
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:31.829
- Yeah.

883
00:53:33.002 --> 00:53:34.970
So does your sister do
this as well?

884
00:53:40.251 --> 00:53:41.148
- No.

885
00:53:41.770 --> 00:53:44.082
No. she kinda withdrew.

886
00:53:45.498 --> 00:53:48.294
You know. after our parents
died. she got really depressed.

887
00:53:49.295 --> 00:53:50.537
She was committed for a while.

888
00:53:50.917 --> 00:53:51.435
- Really?

889
00:53:52.367 --> 00:53:53.230
- Yeah. what started
out as nightmares

890
00:53:53.851 --> 00:53:54.369
slowly became reality.

891
00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:56.198
- Oh. how do you mean?

892
00:53:58.235 --> 00:54:00.651
- She started having these
hallucinations.

893
00:54:05.172 --> 00:54:06.104
Yeah. she freaked out and she
started screaming.

894
00:54:06.657 --> 00:54:07.658
"Not you. not you."

895
00:54:08.314 --> 00:54:09.556
- [Cory] What'd she mean?

896
00:54:11.455 --> 00:54:12.041
- I don't know. she
never told me.

897
00:54:12.939 --> 00:54:15.079
- Thanks for telling my
life story. Bri.

898
00:54:16.977 --> 00:54:18.047
- She's okay now.

899
00:54:19.290 --> 00:54:20.464
She's an accountant.

900
00:54:21.050 --> 00:54:22.259
Self-made one. too.

901
00:54:24.157 --> 00:54:24.709
Actually. I haven't talked
to her in a while.

902
00:54:25.227 --> 00:54:26.055
I kinda miss her.

903
00:54:27.747 --> 00:54:28.575
- I miss you too.

904
00:54:31.854 --> 00:54:34.271
- Yeah. man. I know
what you mean.

905
00:54:35.272 --> 00:54:37.135
So what's up with this thing?

906
00:54:41.485 --> 00:54:41.830
- The Mayans used it as a tool

907
00:54:42.658 --> 00:54:43.659
for conducting
ritual sacrifices.

908
00:54:44.867 --> 00:54:46.904
- [Cory] I wonder how they did
that. the blade ain't even--

909
00:54:47.353 --> 00:54:48.733
Ow! [groans]

910
00:54:49.216 --> 00:54:49.838
- [Brian] Jesus.

911
00:54:50.563 --> 00:54:51.529
Oh. dude. that's a lot of blood.

912
00:54:52.047 --> 00:54:53.255
Oh. whoa. whoa!

913
00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:54.843
Oh. dude!

914
00:54:55.464 --> 00:54:56.362
Jesus. man. what'd you do?

915
00:54:56.983 --> 00:54:57.259
- I don't know. damn it.

916
00:54:57.915 --> 00:54:58.778
The blade didn't look sharp.

917
00:54:59.261 --> 00:54:59.399
- Let me see it.

918
00:55:00.193 --> 00:55:01.470
- It's like a freaking scalpel.

919
00:55:02.368 --> 00:55:02.540
- [Brian] All right. man.
come on.

920
00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:03.714
let's get that bandaged. Doctor.

921
00:55:04.784 --> 00:55:05.647
- [Cory] Well. make sure you
sterilize that thing.

922
00:55:06.544 --> 00:55:07.131
I don't wanna catch
the Mayan clap.

923
00:55:08.097 --> 00:55:08.960
- [Brian] Didn't have
sex with it. man.

924
00:55:10.030 --> 00:55:12.309
That's some powerful VD. though.
think about that.

925
00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:14.311
Gonna have to amputate
your whole hand.

926
00:55:14.794 --> 00:55:15.415
[ominous music]

927
00:55:15.898 --> 00:55:17.279
- What the hell?

928
00:55:17.659 --> 00:55:19.937
[cracking]

929
00:55:55.282 --> 00:55:56.560
- Okay. that's weird.

930
00:55:57.595 --> 00:55:59.494
Where did the heart go? - Brian.
the heart moved

931
00:56:00.149 --> 00:56:02.082
and went into the wall.

932
00:56:07.778 --> 00:56:10.021
[rumbling]

933
00:56:11.506 --> 00:56:13.162
Brian. Brian!

934
00:56:13.749 --> 00:56:15.786
- [Kim] Hey. you okay?

935
00:56:16.407 --> 00:56:17.753
- Yeah. yeah. just fine.

936
00:56:18.754 --> 00:56:20.135
- [Kim] I just thought
something was wrong.

937
00:56:20.929 --> 00:56:22.965
- [Brian] No. I'm cool.
it's fine.

938
00:56:23.656 --> 00:56:25.071
Everything's fine. - Brian.

939
00:56:27.107 --> 00:56:27.936
Bri?

940
00:56:28.971 --> 00:56:29.834
Why am I here?

941
00:56:37.635 --> 00:56:39.706
[groans]

942
00:56:41.846 --> 00:56:42.744
- Oh. damn.

943
00:56:44.987 --> 00:56:46.333
The hell happened?

944
00:56:51.511 --> 00:56:53.410
The hell happened here?

945
00:57:05.214 --> 00:57:06.699
The hell happened?

946
00:57:07.838 --> 00:57:08.666
- Kenneth!

947
00:57:10.081 --> 00:57:10.910
Kenneth!

948
00:57:12.221 --> 00:57:13.050
Kenneth!

949
00:57:15.811 --> 00:57:16.881
Kenneth! - Jen?

950
00:57:17.399 --> 00:57:17.848
Where'd you go?

951
00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:20.229
- [Jennifer] God. please
hear me. Kenneth!

952
00:57:20.747 --> 00:57:23.681
[static crackling]

953
00:57:27.961 --> 00:57:28.790
- Holy shit.

954
00:57:30.654 --> 00:57:31.586
What the fuck is going on?

955
00:57:32.656 --> 00:57:34.899
- I don't know. Ken. just
get me out of here!

956
00:57:36.729 --> 00:57:38.282
- How do you expect me to pull
that one off. sweetie?

957
00:57:39.421 --> 00:57:42.044
- [Jennifer] I don't know. just
figure something out!

958
00:57:50.225 --> 00:57:50.674
- [Dad] Let me see how
you do without me.

959
00:57:51.537 --> 00:57:51.916
- [Mary] I'll do
great without you.

960
00:57:52.779 --> 00:57:54.471
because I did great
with my life.

961
00:57:55.679 --> 00:57:56.714
- [Dad] Yeah. let me know when
you fucking figure that out.

962
00:57:57.474 --> 00:57:58.544
Figure it out. Mary. I wanna see

963
00:57:59.268 --> 00:57:59.614
how you fucking figure it out.

964
00:58:00.615 --> 00:58:01.029
- Oh. I will figure it out!
- You can't figure

965
00:58:01.650 --> 00:58:02.202
anything out on your own.

966
00:58:02.824 --> 00:58:03.065
- Oh. I'll figure it out.

967
00:58:04.066 --> 00:58:04.895
I figured plenty of
things out on my own.

968
00:58:05.482 --> 00:58:06.690
and you don't know.

969
00:58:07.725 --> 00:58:09.589
And I would rather die.

970
00:58:10.832 --> 00:58:12.454
[gun fires]

971
00:58:12.868 --> 00:58:13.869
- Jen. wait!

972
00:58:17.217 --> 00:58:19.599
[wind howls]

973
00:58:27.711 --> 00:58:29.367
[tense music]

974
00:58:29.713 --> 00:58:30.541
- What?

975
00:58:32.232 --> 00:58:33.061
- Hey.

976
00:58:34.027 --> 00:58:35.408
Is that this house?

977
00:58:38.238 --> 00:58:39.757
[audience applauds]

978
00:58:40.517 --> 00:58:42.070
Who are those people behind you?

979
00:58:44.244 --> 00:58:45.556
- Hey. you know you look sexy
when you do that?

980
00:58:46.488 --> 00:58:47.869
- When I play air drums
and take notes?

981
00:58:48.455 --> 00:58:50.181
- Yeah. - Seriously?

982
00:58:50.561 --> 00:58:50.734
- Yeah.

983
00:58:51.493 --> 00:58:51.700
- I guess what they say is true.

984
00:58:52.667 --> 00:58:54.565
you med school chicks are
damaged goods.

985
00:58:55.083 --> 00:58:55.739
- Fix me. Doctor.

986
00:58:56.602 --> 00:58:56.843
- Oh God. Ken. get me
out of here.

987
00:58:57.775 --> 00:58:58.293
I do not wanna see this.
[audience whoops]

988
00:58:59.501 --> 00:59:01.365
- I don't know. I'm thinking
about putting in some popcorn.

989
00:59:01.952 --> 00:59:02.953
extra buttery-- - Ken!

990
00:59:03.609 --> 00:59:05.403
- Sorry. just kidding. jeez.

991
00:59:08.993 --> 00:59:10.374
You might wanna turn around.

992
00:59:13.722 --> 00:59:15.759
- God. it's happening again.

993
00:59:16.553 --> 00:59:17.381
- What. what's happening again?

994
00:59:18.589 --> 00:59:20.177
- Trust me. you don't wanna
know. just get me out of here!

995
00:59:20.798 --> 00:59:22.904
- But I don't have a...

996
00:59:23.249 --> 00:59:24.491
Shit.

997
00:59:24.837 --> 00:59:25.941
No. no!

998
00:59:26.252 --> 00:59:27.080
Jen!

999
00:59:27.425 --> 00:59:28.254
Damn it!

1000
00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:31.257
- Ken. get me out of here!

1001
00:59:31.706 --> 00:59:33.431
[tense music]

1002
00:59:33.742 --> 00:59:34.018

1003
00:59:34.985 --> 00:59:36.573

[audience screaming]

1009
00:59:51.311 --> 00:59:52.727
[Jennifer screams]

1010
00:59:53.624 --> 00:59:54.936
- You're really
getting into this.

1011
00:59:55.453 --> 00:59:56.351
Oh. okay. okay.

1012
00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:58.077
Okay. all right.

1013
00:59:58.767 --> 01:00:01.114

Shut the fucking door.

1023
01:00:41.534 --> 01:00:43.363
- What. are you gonna sit around
and bitch at me all night?

1024
01:00:43.881 --> 01:00:44.261
- Are you serious?

1025
01:00:44.917 --> 01:00:45.262
- Why don't you understand?

1026
01:00:45.883 --> 01:00:46.712
This is my job. all right?

1027
01:00:47.436 --> 01:00:47.885
- I do understand that. okay?

1028
01:00:48.921 --> 01:00:50.854
But you've been working on
this all weekend.

1029
01:00:51.509 --> 01:00:51.820
You can't even look at me.

1030
01:00:53.028 --> 01:00:53.719
I'm just asking you to spend a
little bit of time with me.

1031
01:00:54.858 --> 01:00:57.619
- Yeah. well. I gotta be able to
pay bills. babe. okay?

1032
01:00:58.102 --> 01:00:58.931
- Unbelievable.

1033
01:01:02.831 --> 01:01:03.107
- What the fuck is
wrong with you?

1034
01:01:03.970 --> 01:01:04.799
- This is what's fucking
wrong with me!

1035
01:01:05.834 --> 01:01:07.077
- Kim. please. that is
priceless. all right?

1036
01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:07.767
That is special.

1037
01:01:08.768 --> 01:01:09.424
Promise we will spend
some time together.

1038
01:01:10.287 --> 01:01:11.840
but I need to get this done.
okay?

1039
01:01:12.945 --> 01:01:14.187
Besides. didn't I spend all
last week with you?

1040
01:01:15.154 --> 01:01:17.087
Taking you shopping.
buying you dresses!

1041
01:01:17.777 --> 01:01:22.782
I mean. what if... [roaring]

1042
01:01:23.645 --> 01:01:25.509
[screams] Kim!

1043
01:01:27.166 --> 01:01:29.168
Kim. Kim!

1044
01:01:31.791 --> 01:01:32.861
No!

1045
01:01:33.206 --> 01:01:34.104
[shouts]

1046
01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:37.694
[suspenseful music]

1047
01:01:41.249 --> 01:01:41.905
- No. no. no. no. no. no.

1048
01:01:42.975 --> 01:01:45.598
Brian. now is not the time.
you have to leave.

1049
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.910
- Come on. come on.

1050
01:01:47.773 --> 01:01:48.635
- Here's the piece
de resistance.

1051
01:01:49.567 --> 01:01:54.365
We have an actual
fossilized human heart.

1052
01:01:59.888 --> 01:02:01.614
But what we do think is. you'll
notice these lines

1053
01:02:02.753 --> 01:02:04.582
around the victims' heads. or
the sacrificees' heads.

1054
01:02:05.411 --> 01:02:06.136
[gun fires] We believe
that indicates

1055
01:02:07.206 --> 01:02:09.139
that they were in some sort
of ecstatic state.

1056
01:02:10.209 --> 01:02:14.800
experiencing some form of
almost a mental trance.

1057
01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:19.666
- No. Jen. wait!

1058
01:02:23.256 --> 01:02:24.085
- Don't look.

1059
01:02:26.397 --> 01:02:27.640
- Oh my god. Jen! - Brian!

1060
01:02:28.572 --> 01:02:31.195
- Jen. if you find this.
please leave now.

1061
01:02:32.162 --> 01:02:34.095
If you can't leave.
you'll get trapped.

1062
01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:37.823
Here are the instructions.

1063
01:02:38.168 --> 01:02:38.996
Watch.

1064
01:02:39.928 --> 01:02:40.757
Leave now.

1065
01:02:42.379 --> 01:02:43.345
Leave.

1066
01:02:43.690 --> 01:02:44.484
Shit!

1067
01:02:46.383 --> 01:02:48.385
Fuck. come on. come on.

1068
01:02:49.593 --> 01:02:51.698
- Help! [banging]

1069
01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:54.529
- [Mirror Jennifer] The animal
became disenchanted.

1070
01:02:55.841 --> 01:02:56.876
Some would say it was angry.
- Help me. help!

1071
01:02:57.774 --> 01:02:59.085
- With its weak and
slender legs.

1072
01:02:59.845 --> 01:03:00.017
- Are you gonna let me die here

1073
01:03:01.122 --> 01:03:02.813
just like you let your sister
watch your mother

1074
01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:04.090
blow her brains out?

1075
01:03:04.608 --> 01:03:05.885
- No. no. no. no!

1076
01:03:06.437 --> 01:03:06.783
[unsettling music]

1077
01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:08.405
- They didn't seem to
be as strong

1078
01:03:09.268 --> 01:03:10.752
as those he had seen
on other deer.

1079
01:03:11.615 --> 01:03:13.444
They didn't seem to
be as steady.

1080
01:03:16.896 --> 01:03:18.518
He wondered how on earth they
were supporting him now.

1081
01:03:19.450 --> 01:03:21.659
- You're weak. just
like your sister.

1082
01:03:22.522 --> 01:03:24.801
And soon. we will have you both.

1083
01:03:25.111 --> 01:03:25.284
- No.

1084
01:03:26.388 --> 01:03:27.665
I won't let that happen. -
Brian almost got away.

1085
01:03:28.632 --> 01:03:28.908
- What can you do? -
Found his strength.

1086
01:03:29.875 --> 01:03:30.737
and it carried him to safety.
- You're weak.

1087
01:03:31.462 --> 01:03:33.188
Weak and crazy. - For a time.

1088
01:03:34.086 --> 01:03:35.156
- You're weak just
like your sister.

1089
01:03:36.364 --> 01:03:38.745
- But then he came back. and he
got tangled in the trees.

1090
01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:39.781
- Shut your mouth. - Like you?

1091
01:03:40.886 --> 01:03:43.233
- And his death rattle brought
the lion another meal.

1092
01:03:43.923 --> 01:03:44.303
- Shut up. shut up. - To us.

1093
01:03:45.166 --> 01:03:45.580
- You know what the
difference is

1094
01:03:46.305 --> 01:03:49.066
between you and I? - Shut up!

1095
01:03:49.549 --> 01:03:50.378
- Where's Brian?

1096
01:03:51.551 --> 01:03:53.415
- Spending some time
with a friend.

1097
01:03:53.795 --> 01:03:55.935
[screams]

1098
01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:57.764
- Why me?

1099
01:03:58.144 --> 01:03:59.007
Why Brian?

1100
01:03:59.697 --> 01:04:01.734
- Because it's in the blood.

1101
01:04:02.424 --> 01:04:03.494
It focuses on people like you.

1102
01:04:04.047 --> 01:04:05.082
- Don't you mean us?

1103
01:04:06.083 --> 01:04:07.015
- You mean you haven't
figured it out yet?

1104
01:04:07.602 --> 01:04:08.016
- Figured out what?

1105
01:04:08.741 --> 01:04:10.156
- How's Aunt Christine doing?

1106
01:04:13.573 --> 01:04:14.160
- Why did you take me?

1107
01:04:14.678 --> 01:04:16.128
[static crackles]

1108
01:04:17.163 --> 01:04:20.201
- Brian. I did take you. you
and your sister.

1109
01:04:20.891 --> 01:04:21.512
even though I wasn't ready.

1110
01:04:22.306 --> 01:04:22.824
I mean. I had plans too.
you know.

1111
01:04:23.445 --> 01:04:24.584
You guys changed all that.

1112
01:04:25.137 --> 01:04:25.862
It was no big deal.

1113
01:04:26.483 --> 01:04:27.656
I just had to readjust.

1114
01:04:28.726 --> 01:04:30.452
Feed you and clothe you. -
You're not really here.

1115
01:04:31.074 --> 01:04:31.384
You're not really here.

1116
01:04:32.558 --> 01:04:36.217
- Pay for your head shrinking
and your anti-psychotics.

1117
01:04:37.701 --> 01:04:38.875
But that's what families do for
each other. right?

1118
01:04:39.599 --> 01:04:41.187
They help each other out! - No!

1119
01:04:42.050 --> 01:04:45.260
- I am asking for your help now.
Brian.

1120
01:04:46.158 --> 01:04:49.126
- Brian. don't listen to her.
okay?

1121
01:04:49.713 --> 01:04:50.748
It's not Christine.

1122
01:04:51.646 --> 01:04:53.959
Hey Brian. I need you
to leave now.

1123
01:04:56.409 --> 01:04:58.377
I need you to be strong for me.
Brian. okay?

1124
01:04:58.825 --> 01:05:00.413
- No. Brian.

1125
01:05:01.725 --> 01:05:02.899
Stay with me.

1126
01:05:05.142 --> 01:05:05.971
I was young. - Brian.

1127
01:05:06.557 --> 01:05:07.627
- So young. - Brian!

1128
01:05:09.629 --> 01:05:11.286
- I still am. you know?

1129
01:05:12.184 --> 01:05:13.944
I can't believe how
you've grown up.

1130
01:05:14.738 --> 01:05:16.153
You look just like your father.

1131
01:05:16.671 --> 01:05:17.914
- Brian. Brian.

1132
01:05:19.467 --> 01:05:22.470
[suspenseful music]

1133
01:05:25.956 --> 01:05:26.784
Brian!

1134
01:05:41.006 --> 01:05:42.593
- Also found some metal pieces.

1135
01:05:43.629 --> 01:05:47.253
which we also believe are
part of the ceremony.

1136
01:05:50.670 --> 01:05:52.845
[tapping]

1137
01:06:02.475 --> 01:06:04.650
[tapping]

1138
01:06:10.725 --> 01:06:11.622
We'll show some closeups
of these later.

1139
01:06:12.589 --> 01:06:13.383
but these things are
absolutely amazing.

1140
01:06:14.418 --> 01:06:17.456
They seem to indicate that
what we've stumbled on

1141
01:06:18.422 --> 01:06:22.116
is some sort of rogue
sect of believers

1142
01:06:23.048 --> 01:06:25.050
who followed the Mayan
deity Pach-We.

1143
01:06:26.223 --> 01:06:28.950
That translates. very roughly of
course. to Flesh Eater.

1144
01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:34.991
Now these pictures also show
some sort of ceremony

1145
01:06:36.061 --> 01:06:37.200
some sort of
sacrificial ceremony.

1146
01:06:38.235 --> 01:06:40.513
We're still trying to figure
out the details.

1147
01:06:41.790 --> 01:06:43.033
You'll notice that
the victims here

1148
01:06:44.241 --> 01:06:47.658
are having their hearts drawn or
pulled out of their body.

1149
01:06:48.659 --> 01:06:50.282
Now we're not sure. it
could be a metaphor.

1150
01:06:51.179 --> 01:06:51.628
it could be some sort of
actual parasite.

1151
01:06:52.732 --> 01:06:54.907
You'll notice these lines around
the victims' heads.

1152
01:06:55.528 --> 01:06:56.150
or the sacrificees' heads.

1153
01:06:57.116 --> 01:06:58.117
and we believe that
indicates that they were

1154
01:06:58.911 --> 01:07:00.430
in some sort of ecstatic state.

1155
01:07:01.603 --> 01:07:04.813
The sacrificees had something
drawn out of their bodies.

1156
01:07:06.298 --> 01:07:08.024
With this. I'll anticipate.
we're still very. very early

1157
01:07:08.921 --> 01:07:09.784
in the stages here of
our analysis.

1158
01:07:10.957 --> 01:07:14.099
This is a ceremonial ax. or a
bot. that they would use.

1159
01:07:14.961 --> 01:07:15.307
Now it looks like in
the drawings

1160
01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:19.000
that they somehow draw these
creatures out of some sort.

1161
01:07:20.139 --> 01:07:21.692
and then bam. they just go ahead
and chop it right there

1162
01:07:22.521 --> 01:07:24.143
and hit is as hard
as they could.

1163
01:07:28.803 --> 01:07:31.288
[tense music]

1164
01:07:32.634 --> 01:07:33.325
- I'm right here!

1165
01:07:34.222 --> 01:07:36.776
Come on. come on. come
on and get me!

1166
01:07:37.398 --> 01:07:38.778
What are you waiting for?

1167
01:07:39.676 --> 01:07:42.058
Come on. come on. come
on and get me!

1168
01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:44.267
Come on. what are you
waiting for?

1169
01:07:44.784 --> 01:07:45.820
I'm right here!

1170
01:07:46.407 --> 01:07:47.339
Come on. I'm right here!

1171
01:07:47.891 --> 01:07:49.306
That's what it is.

1172
01:07:50.549 --> 01:07:51.377
You are scared.

1173
01:07:53.586 --> 01:07:57.142
Scared because you know that I
know how to kill you!

1174
01:08:00.179 --> 01:08:02.975
Listen to me. can't even believe
this is happening.

1175
01:08:03.355 --> 01:08:05.598
[growling]

1176
01:08:10.189 --> 01:08:12.674
- No. no. wait. I can stop it!

1177
01:08:22.374 --> 01:08:26.861
- You're not getting Jen. so
let's get this over with.

1178

[somber music]

1179
01:08:34.212 --> 01:08:36.112
- Brian! - Jen. no!

1180
01:08:37.941 --> 01:08:38.872
- Brian. why didn't you leave?

1181
01:08:39.494 --> 01:08:42.428
- Because they wanted you.

1182
01:08:43.878 --> 01:08:45.844
I know how to kill it.

1183
01:08:46.432 --> 01:08:48.434
Stab me in the heart.

1184
01:08:49.090 --> 01:08:50.367
- No. no. no. no. I can't.

1185
01:08:50.953 --> 01:08:51.782
- Please! - I can't.

1186
01:08:52.162 --> 01:08:52.921
- Please!

1187
01:08:53.681 --> 01:08:55.786
Do it. do it! - I can't.
I can't!

No. no.

1191
01:09:16.807 --> 01:09:18.532
- You should have run. Jenn.

1192
01:09:21.191 --> 01:09:22.503
Cause now you're mine.

1193

01:10:00.989 --> 01:10:02.300
- No. Jen. wait!

- Mommy?

1198
01:10:08.721 --> 01:10:09.550
- Jenny?

1199
01:10:10.758 --> 01:10:14.486
I'm so sorry.

I am so sorry.

[gun fires]

1204
01:10:36.370 --> 01:10:38.820
- So you think she saw it all?

1205
01:10:40.374 --> 01:10:44.273
- Yeah. I think so. according
to what Brian said.

1206
01:10:45.206 --> 01:10:47.380
Look. I'm sorry about
your brother.

1207
01:10:48.347 --> 01:10:51.350
- He was a bastard to
Mary and the kids.

1208
01:10:56.148 --> 01:10:57.287
- Are you gonna take custody?

1209
01:10:58.668 --> 01:10:59.496
- Absolutely.

- Come on. Jennifer!

01:11:07.124 --> 01:11:08.056
Where the hell did
you come from?

1213
01:11:08.919 --> 01:11:10.023
- I couldn't save him.
- Save who?

1214
01:11:10.576 --> 01:11:11.163
- [Jennifer] Brian.

1215
01:11:11.715 --> 01:11:12.198
I couldn't save him.

1216
01:11:12.785 --> 01:11:13.510
- [shushes] It's okay.

1217
01:11:14.304 --> 01:11:15.409
I'm right here. I'm right here.

- How do I know that
you're real?

real enough for you?

Come on. let's go!

1222
01:11:32.148 --> 01:11:32.495
- No. wait. we have to kill it.

1223
01:11:33.254 --> 01:11:33.806
- What? - We have to kill it.

1224
01:11:34.531 --> 01:11:35.360
- No. no. no. - It's coming out!

1225

We have to kill it! - No.
listen.

1226
01:11:38.085 --> 01:11:40.296
We gotta get out of
here right now.

Come on!

01:11:50.547 --> 01:11:51.652
What the fuck?

1229
01:11:52.237 --> 01:11:53.585
Hey. just stay here.

1230
01:11:57.485 --> 01:11:58.521
Oh. come on!

1231

- You see. it won't
let us leave.

1232

- The window. come on.

1233
01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:15.710
This can't be happening.

1234
01:12:23.856 --> 01:12:25.375
Why can't we leave. huh?

1235
01:12:27.412 --> 01:12:28.654
What does it want. huh?

1236
01:12:29.309 --> 01:12:29.793
What does it want from us?

1237
01:12:30.276 --> 01:12:31.416
- It wants us!

1238
01:12:32.693 --> 01:12:34.280
Don't you understand that?

1239
01:12:34.833 --> 01:12:35.764
We have to kill it!

01:12:46.707 --> 01:12:49.330
How do you suppose we do that?

1243
01:12:49.606 --> 01:12:50.400
Hm?

1244
01:12:55.059 --> 01:12:58.891
- Brian left us
detailed instructions

1245
01:12:59.478 --> 01:13:00.445
on what we need to do.

1246
01:13:01.066 --> 01:13:02.895
We just need to do it.

1247
01:13:04.725 --> 01:13:06.105
- Oh. [chuckles]

1248
01:13:06.451 --> 01:13:07.279
Well.

1249
01:13:09.833 --> 01:13:11.145
It's easier said than done.

1250
01:13:12.559 --> 01:13:14.700
[mutters]

1251
01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:22.294
- No. no. no. you don't have to.
okay?

1252
01:13:22.708 --> 01:13:23.639
It wants me.

1253
01:13:25.573 --> 01:13:27.299
It wants me. and that's
what it's gonna get.

1254
01:13:27.644 --> 01:13:28.473
- What?

1255
01:13:31.337 --> 01:13:34.443
- You just have to get it
while it's grabbing me.

1256
01:13:35.341 --> 01:13:37.171
and you have to stab me
in the heart.

1257
01:13:38.275 --> 01:13:39.242
Okay. while it's...

1258
01:13:40.312 --> 01:13:40.485
- While it's what?

1259
01:13:41.139 --> 01:13:42.418
- While it's eating me.

1260
01:13:47.181 --> 01:13:50.391
That's the best time to do it.
when it's in-between planes.

1261
01:13:51.288 --> 01:13:53.221
and that's when it's the
most vulnerable.

1262
01:13:54.119 --> 01:13:56.121
That's what Brian tried to do.
but--

1263
01:13:56.535 --> 01:13:57.433
- But what?

1264
01:14:01.195 --> 01:14:02.023
- Nothing.

1265
01:14:04.681 --> 01:14:05.751
- I can't.

1266
01:14:06.338 --> 01:14:07.443
Jen. this is crazy.

1267
01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:09.237
- Listen. Kenneth.

1268
01:14:11.170 --> 01:14:13.827
We have to stand up and fight
this thing. okay?

1269
01:14:14.933 --> 01:14:16.382
We have to do this.

1270
01:14:16.934 --> 01:14:18.454
You have to do this.

1271
01:14:19.558 --> 01:14:20.386
Okay?

1272
01:14:29.948 --> 01:14:30.776
- Yeah.

1273
01:14:35.228 --> 01:14:36.057
Yeah.

1274
01:14:37.127 --> 01:14:37.852
Where's the weapon?

1275
01:14:38.404 --> 01:14:41.304
[foreboding music]

1276
01:14:44.652 --> 01:14:45.826
Come on. let's go.

1277
01:14:46.343 --> 01:14:47.931
[shushes] Wait.

1278
01:14:48.656 --> 01:14:49.070
Did you hear something? - What?

1279
01:14:49.968 --> 01:14:52.487
- [Brian] Hey. Kenneth. Kenneth.
Kenneth.

1280
01:14:53.109 --> 01:14:55.421
Kenneth. Kenneth. Kenneth.

1281
01:14:55.905 --> 01:14:56.940
Kenneth. Kenneth.

1282
01:14:57.562 --> 01:14:57.838
- Kenneth. don't listen.

1283
01:14:58.735 --> 01:14:59.425
it's just this thing
toying with us.

1284
01:15:00.081 --> 01:15:01.255
- But it sounds like Brian.

1285
01:15:01.876 --> 01:15:02.946
Hey Brian. is that you?

1286
01:15:03.429 --> 01:15:03.844
Where you at?

1287
01:15:04.914 --> 01:15:08.020
- [Brian] I'm right here. Ken.
get me out of here.

1288
01:15:08.675 --> 01:15:08.987
- Kenneth. that isn't Brian!

1289
01:15:09.884 --> 01:15:10.091
Trust me. you don't
have to do this!

1290
01:15:11.127 --> 01:15:12.508
- Why don't you wanna save
your brother. huh?

1291
01:15:13.059 --> 01:15:13.300
He's in that wall.

1292
01:15:14.337 --> 01:15:15.338
I can get him out and you
don't have to die.

1293
01:15:15.787 --> 01:15:16.615
- What. Kenneth!

1294
01:15:17.823 --> 01:15:18.548
I'm telling you he's
fucking gone!

1295
01:15:19.135 --> 01:15:20.308
- No. no. he's not!

1296
01:15:21.517 --> 01:15:23.103
He's in there. I'm
gonna get him out.

1297
01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:24.450
We're ending this right now.

1298
01:15:25.313 --> 01:15:29.386
- Just listen to yourself.
Kenneth!

1299
01:15:30.318 --> 01:15:33.080
- Hang on. Bri. I'm
coming to get you!

1300
01:15:33.598 --> 01:15:35.116
Coming to get you!

1301
01:15:36.601 --> 01:15:38.809
[growling]

1302
01:15:41.053 --> 01:15:41.882
The fuck?

1303
01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:46.680
What the fuck?

1304
01:15:48.059 --> 01:15:49.752
[shouts]

1305
01:15:50.130 --> 01:15:50.960
Oh. oh!

1306
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:56.621
[groans]

1307
01:16:09.772 --> 01:16:11.428
Brian. you in there?

1308
01:16:13.327 --> 01:16:15.639
Brian. Brian!

1309
01:16:17.124 --> 01:16:18.850
[grunts]

1310
01:16:19.575 --> 01:16:20.679
I'm coming to get you. Brian!

1311
01:16:21.335 --> 01:16:23.440
Coming to get you. Brian!

1312
01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:25.407
Brian!

1313
01:16:29.136 --> 01:16:30.137
Fuck. Brian!

1314
01:16:36.177 --> 01:16:37.040
- [Brian] Kenneth.

1315
01:16:38.523 --> 01:16:39.353
- Holy shit.

1316
01:16:40.665 --> 01:16:43.668
- What. I told you I
was in here.

1317
01:16:44.219 --> 01:16:45.704
Me and my friends.

1318
01:16:48.983 --> 01:16:50.709
- Come on. Let's get
out of here!

1319
01:16:51.089 --> 01:16:53.436
[giggles]

1320
01:16:53.816 --> 01:16:56.094
[rumbling]

1321
01:17:07.174 --> 01:17:08.002
Come on!

1322
01:17:12.005 --> 01:17:13.663
[glass shatters]

1323
01:17:14.284 --> 01:17:15.147
- [Kenneth] Jennifer!

1324
01:17:15.734 --> 01:17:16.217
- Ken. your arm! - What?

1325
01:17:17.115 --> 01:17:20.118
I know. we'll take
care of it later.

1326
01:17:21.119 --> 01:17:22.291
[snarls]

1327
01:17:22.638 --> 01:17:23.811
Come on!

1328
01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:26.607
[gun fires]

1329
01:17:27.608 --> 01:17:29.299
[shouts]

1330
01:17:29.679 --> 01:17:31.647
[roars]

1331
01:17:35.719 --> 01:17:36.686
Jen. the ax!

1332
01:17:38.273 --> 01:17:39.102
- Got it.

1333
01:17:41.691 --> 01:17:42.519
- Weak.

1334
01:17:43.555 --> 01:17:44.383
Crazy.

1335
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:46.178
Weak.

1336
01:17:47.145 --> 01:17:47.939
Crazy.

1337
01:17:49.768 --> 01:17:50.562
- Give in.

1338
01:17:50.942 --> 01:17:51.839
- Give up.

1339
01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:53.530
- It's not that hard.

1340
01:17:54.186 --> 01:17:54.877
- It's in your blood. baby.

1341
01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:57.880
- She's right. it's
in our blood.

1342
01:17:59.053 --> 01:18:03.333
Can you feel it?

1343
01:18:03.817 --> 01:18:04.818
- No. get away!

1344
01:18:05.163 --> 01:18:07.027
[shouts]

1345
01:18:07.406 --> 01:18:09.407
[yelps]

1346
01:18:14.897 --> 01:18:16.933
[growls]

1347
01:18:27.254 --> 01:18:28.807
- You're gonna end up in the
padded room again.

1348
01:18:29.152 --> 01:18:29.981
- No.

1349
01:18:30.913 --> 01:18:31.050
No.

1350
01:18:31.809 --> 01:18:33.812
- You know what you have to do.

1351
01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:35.849
- You'll never amount
to anything.

1352
01:18:36.434 --> 01:18:37.091
- Get away. [moans]

1353
01:18:38.058 --> 01:18:39.715
- You'll never be like
what I've become!

1354
01:18:40.646 --> 01:18:41.993
- Shut up! - You'll
always be weak!

1355
01:18:42.718 --> 01:18:44.236
- Shut up! - Weak and crazy!

1356
01:18:44.823 --> 01:18:45.134
- Shut up! - Jennifer!

1357
01:18:46.273 --> 01:18:48.344
You know what you have to do! -
Crazy. weak and crazy!

1358
01:18:49.034 --> 01:18:50.277
- Stop it! - Weak and crazy!

1359
01:18:50.933 --> 01:18:51.898
Weak and crazy! - Shut up!

1360
01:18:52.969 --> 01:18:55.558
- You have to kill me before
it kills us both!

1361
01:18:56.248 --> 01:18:57.802
- Weak and crazy! - Kill me!

1362
01:18:58.147 --> 01:18:58.526
[shouts]

1363
01:18:59.355 --> 01:19:00.356
- There was a deer
in the forest.

1364
01:19:00.977 --> 01:19:02.978
Summer was very. very hot.

1365
01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:05.326
In the heat. the deer
became very thirsty.

1366
01:19:06.431 --> 01:19:09.192
He found a small spring and
decided to take a drink.

1367
01:19:10.262 --> 01:19:11.367
He noticed his
reflection in the water.

1368
01:19:12.575 --> 01:19:16.234
and greatly admired the size and
the shape of his antlers.

1369
01:19:16.924 --> 01:19:17.304
[screams] The animal became

1370
01:19:17.787 --> 01:19:19.168
disenchanted.

1371
01:19:19.651 --> 01:19:20.410
[creature roars]

1372
01:19:21.273 --> 01:19:23.413
[groans] His weak
and small legs.

1373
01:19:23.862 --> 01:19:24.103
[somber music]

1374
01:19:25.105 --> 01:19:26.139
They didn't seem to be as
strong as those

1375
01:19:26.796 --> 01:19:28.798
he had seen on other deer.

1376
01:19:29.695 --> 01:19:31.525
They didn't seem to
be as steady.

1377
01:19:34.493 --> 01:19:37.842
He wondered how on earth they
were supporting him.

1378
01:19:38.843 --> 01:19:41.155
As the deer contemplated
himself in the spring.

1379
01:19:41.707 --> 01:19:42.398
a lion approached.

1380
01:19:43.433 --> 01:19:45.781
Seeing the deer so distracted.
the lion crouched.

1381
01:19:46.126 --> 01:19:48.128
[roars]

1382
01:19:52.891 --> 01:19:54.893
[groans]

1383
01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:58.552
[creature screeches]

1384
01:19:59.864 --> 01:20:00.934
The deer was very fast indeed.

1385
01:20:02.004 --> 01:20:05.110
and as long as the path
remained smooth and open.

1386
01:20:06.491 --> 01:20:07.594
the deer remained a safe
distance away.

1387
01:20:07.975 --> 01:20:10.253
[shouting]

1388
01:20:17.019 --> 01:20:19.159
[screams]

1389
01:20:22.990 --> 01:20:25.130
The deer became entangled
with his antlers.

1390
01:20:32.931 --> 01:20:36.107
Thus the lion caught him. and
had a wonderful meal that day.

1391
01:20:36.590 --> 01:20:39.144
[somber music]

1392
01:20:42.285 --> 01:20:43.079
- Fuck!

1393
01:20:48.567 --> 01:20:50.466
[sobs]

1394
01:21:00.303 --> 01:21:02.098
I get it now. you're
the monster too!

1395
01:21:03.513 --> 01:21:06.032
- Still staring in your river.
admiring your antlers.

1396
01:21:07.483 --> 01:21:08.898
You know. time's like a river.
you hear that a lot.

1397
01:21:09.761 --> 01:21:11.280
So much so that it
loses meaning.

1398
01:21:12.005 --> 01:21:13.627
But it's very true in many ways.

1399
01:21:14.766 --> 01:21:15.353
One of which is crucial.

1400
01:21:16.318 --> 01:21:18.839
Each choice cause a
diversion in the river.

1401
01:21:19.529 --> 01:21:21.221
every one making a new branch.

1402
01:21:22.118 --> 01:21:24.809
You're one. I'm another.

1403
01:21:25.397 --> 01:21:26.088
- It doesn't make sense.

1404
01:21:27.089 --> 01:21:28.745
- What of this makes sense
to any sane person?

1405
01:21:29.228 --> 01:21:30.057
- We're the same!

1406
01:21:32.508 --> 01:21:33.335
- Are we?

1407
01:21:34.544 --> 01:21:36.477
- We both looked. we
both saw it!

1408
01:21:37.962 --> 01:21:38.790
- We did.

1409
01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:41.448
- Then why. how does that make
you any different?

1410
01:21:41.966 --> 01:21:42.967
- We both looked!

1411
01:21:43.968 --> 01:21:47.592
We both looked. we both
looked directly at it.

1412
01:21:48.041 --> 01:21:49.352
Both saw it all.

1413
01:21:52.148 --> 01:21:52.907
The difference is this.

1414
01:21:53.874 --> 01:21:57.222
I'm the version of you
that didn't blink.

1415
01:21:59.776 --> 01:22:01.261
Goodbye. Jennifer.

1416
01:22:14.895 --> 01:22:16.827
[gags]

1417
01:22:45.615 --> 01:22:46.340
- Jennifer?

1418
01:22:46.927 --> 01:22:47.996
Jennifer. oh my god!

1419
01:22:48.411 --> 01:22:49.240
Oh my god!

1420
01:22:51.344 --> 01:22:52.001
Jennifer. I tried to call you.

1421
01:22:53.106 --> 01:22:54.762
But somebody picked up. and all
I heard were these.

1422
01:22:55.349 --> 01:22:56.626
these horrible sounds.

1423
01:22:57.938 --> 01:22:59.491
And then I freaked.

1424
01:23:01.424 --> 01:23:02.253
Jen.

1425
01:23:03.530 --> 01:23:05.946
Oh. baby. why?

1426
01:23:27.933 --> 01:23:31.246
[emergency sirens wail]

1427
01:23:43.397 --> 01:23:46.262
[unsettling music]
