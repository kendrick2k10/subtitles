3
00:02:05.334 --> 00:02:06.460
It's really not fair.

4
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.884
Look. the guy's training
for the Olympics. all right.

5
00:02:13.926 --> 00:02:15.261
He shouldn't be allowed to throw around

6
00:02:15.302 --> 00:02:17.137
his diving skills at parties.

7
00:02:20.724 --> 00:02:22.601
At least he could keep
his shirt on. geez.

8
00:02:22.643 --> 00:02:25.479
He should never have a shirt on.

9
00:02:30.276 --> 00:02:31.569
He has no idea who I am.

10
00:02:33.445 --> 00:02:34.822
How sad is that?

11
00:02:36.407 --> 00:02:38.242
Yeah. how sad is that?

12
00:02:57.511 --> 00:02:58.470
I don't understand what

13
00:02:58.512 --> 00:02:59.889
no. I don't understand
what you're asking me.

14
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:00.806
You just gotta hold it.

15
00:03:00.848 --> 00:03:02.641
I'm holding it.

16
00:03:02.683 --> 00:03:03.309
You have to hold it.

17
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.185
Oh man. you drained the keg.

18
00:03:06.228 --> 00:03:08.856
Uh yeah. gotta move faster out here.

19
00:03:08.898 --> 00:03:09.815
Holy shit. the cops.

20
00:03:11.734 --> 00:03:13.611
The future is so hard to predict.

21
00:03:14.278 --> 00:03:16.405
If I had a time machine.

22
00:03:16.447 --> 00:03:17.948
would it even make a
difference to try to go back

23
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.825
and explain to my young
self what was ahead?

24
00:03:43.182 --> 00:03:45.392
Okay well. show me the other one.

25
00:03:46.352 --> 00:03:47.144
This one?

26
00:03:47.186 --> 00:03:48.979
Yes. definitely more affordable.

27
00:03:49.021 --> 00:03:51.231
Larger. but it's not
as like. all-inclusive.

28
00:03:51.273 --> 00:03:51.857
Right. right.

29
00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:52.691
So there'd be a lot more-

30
00:03:52.733 --> 00:03:54.693
Okay. whiskey sours up everybody.

31
00:03:54.735 --> 00:03:55.986
Thank you.

32
00:03:56.028 --> 00:03:57.363
Welcome.

33
00:03:57.404 --> 00:03:58.697
Bud Light Seltzer for the gentleman.

34
00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.908
Thank you for not
making me have to say it.

35
00:04:02.034 --> 00:04:02.701
Oh my God.

36
00:04:02.743 --> 00:04:03.869
Sorry.

37
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:11.543
So I just wanna say. Sam. Emma.
we are so excited for you.

38
00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:14.797
Thank you for helping our daughter

39
00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:16.674
find a second chance at life.

40
00:04:17.758 --> 00:04:19.677
Welcome to our family. son.

41
00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:20.594
Thank you.

42
00:04:21.387 --> 00:04:23.013
The downstairs toilet is clogged.

43
00:04:23.055 --> 00:04:25.641
I had to put my arm all the way in.

44
00:04:25.683 --> 00:04:28.018
Hey Michael. wow.

45
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.645
What. you're welcome.

46
00:04:29.687 --> 00:04:30.646
Thank you.

47
00:04:30.688 --> 00:04:31.563
Sure.

48
00:04:31.605 --> 00:04:34.984
Well. I also have some words
to share.

49
00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:38.570
I am so proud of the life
that you've made. Emma.

50
00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:39.947
And I know it hasn't been easy.

51
00:04:39.989 --> 00:04:42.074
and there are a lot of people

52
00:04:42.116 --> 00:04:46.537
who would've let that
stop them. but not you.

53
00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:48.539
And look. I know you and I.

54
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.582
we drive each other nuts sometimes.

55
00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:53.544
No. what are you talking
about. drive each other nuts?

56
00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:54.461
Ladies.

57
00:04:55.504 --> 00:04:56.422
What I'm trying to say

58
00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:58.882
is that even though
you're my little sister.

59
00:04:58.924 --> 00:05:03.554
I hope to have as big a
heart as you do one day.

60
00:05:04.638 --> 00:05:05.806
Well said. honey.

61
00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:11.395
Well since we're all making speeches

62
00:05:11.437 --> 00:05:12.688
and making each other cry.

63
00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:15.607
I'd like to thank you Marie.

64
00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:17.443
for pushing me to learn an instrument

65
00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:19.445
because I didn't end up learning one.

66
00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:23.824
but I did run into an old
friend. my best friend.

67
00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:26.618
All right. we get it.

68
00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.454
You like your fiance.

69
00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:29.580
Nice for you.

70
00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:31.749
You are so lucky. you have me.

71
00:05:32.124 --> 00:05:34.043
Wow. wow.

72
00:05:35.586 --> 00:05:38.630
I guess that leaves me.

73
00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:42.426
I guess you all know that
I've been madly in love

74
00:05:42.468 --> 00:05:45.971
with Emma for a few
years now. give or take.

75
00:05:46.013 --> 00:05:47.347
It was eighth grade.

76
00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:48.807
Oh. wow Colin. thank you.

77
00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:52.519
Thank you. yeah. I didn't
realize we were keeping track.

78
00:05:52.561 --> 00:05:53.937
Well. I remember meeting
her for the first time

79
00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:56.857
and thinking. that's it. that's
the girl.

80
00:05:57.816 --> 00:06:00.360
And then life took us
in separate directions.

81
00:06:00.402 --> 00:06:02.571
And when we ran back into each other.

82
00:06:02.613 --> 00:06:05.657
we had both grown up quite
a bit. you could say.

83
00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:06.784
But some things don't change.

84
00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:09.745
And when I look at you now. Emma.

85
00:06:09.787 --> 00:06:12.164
it's like I'm right back
in the eighth grade again.

86
00:06:12.206 --> 00:06:16.001
And I'm thinking. that's
her. that's the girl.

87
00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:19.129
And I look at you all.
and I think that's it.

88
00:06:19.171 --> 00:06:20.672
That's the family.

89
00:06:22.591 --> 00:06:24.009
To family.

90
00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:25.677
To family.

91
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:27.971
Cheer. cheer. cheers.

92
00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:31.016
I left my glass over there.

93
00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:37.397
Hi.

94
00:06:37.898 --> 00:06:38.732
Let's go home?

95
00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:41.777

I don't know.

Hello.

00:07:00.963 --> 00:07:04.925
Sweetheart it's

103
00:07:06.552 --> 00:07:08.512

104
00:07:09.805 --> 00:07:10.806
I'm coming home.

105
00:07:13.225 --> 00:07:16.103
Emma. honey. what is it?

106
00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:20.566
What's going on?

107
00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:22.192
Yeah. gotta move fast around here.

108
00:07:22.234 --> 00:07:23.986
Holy shit. the cops.

109
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:25.821
Emma. come on.

110
00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:31.076
My ride's gone and
your ride.

111
00:07:31.118 --> 00:07:32.578
Sam.

112
00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:34.955
So Sam. he's your boyfriend.

113
00:07:34.997 --> 00:07:36.957
He's my best friend.

114
00:07:36.999 --> 00:07:39.585
Ah. so he wants to be your boyfriend.

115
00:07:39.626 --> 00:07:41.712
but you're not into it. right?

116
00:07:41.753 --> 00:07:43.922
No. no. it's not like that.

117
00:07:43.964 --> 00:07:44.798
Sure.

118
00:07:45.757 --> 00:07:47.926
I mean. maybe it's a little
like that.

119
00:07:47.968 --> 00:07:48.927
A little like that?

120
00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:50.804
Shut up.

121
00:07:54.141 --> 00:07:55.934
I can't believe I failed my breathalyser.

122
00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:57.519
My parents are gonna kill me.

123
00:07:58.854 --> 00:07:59.938
That sucks.

124
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.940
Do you ever feel like
everyone's always telling you

125
00:08:01.982 --> 00:08:02.983
who you are?

126
00:08:03.025 --> 00:08:03.984
All the time.

127
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.946
My parents own the bookstore
in town. Blair Books.

128
00:08:07.988 --> 00:08:09.823
Yeah. I put that one together.

129
00:08:09.865 --> 00:08:10.741
Emma Blair.

130
00:08:11.575 --> 00:08:13.243
They think that me and my sister

131
00:08:13.285 --> 00:08:14.995
are going to take it over

132
00:08:15.037 --> 00:08:16.747
and they don't listen when I say

133
00:08:16.788 --> 00:08:19.124
that I never wanna do that.

134
00:08:19.166 --> 00:08:21.293
Marie wants that and that is
fine for her.

135
00:08:21.335 --> 00:08:23.962
She's always been the perfect
little bookseller's daughter.

136
00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:24.880
Right.

137
00:08:24.922 --> 00:08:27.758
But not me. I'm getting
out of here.

138
00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:28.884
Where are you gonna go?

139
00:08:28.926 --> 00:08:30.636
I'm gonna go see the world.

140
00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:32.054
I like that.

141
00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:34.306
You're not what I imagined
you'd be. you know?

142
00:08:34.348 --> 00:08:36.558
You imagined me?

143
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.562
Well. my ex. she thought
you had a crush on me.

144
00:08:40.604 --> 00:08:41.813
She said she caught you
looking at me sometimes.

145
00:08:41.855 --> 00:08:42.648
No. that's not.

146
00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:46.193
That's- that's- that's
completely un-

147
00:08:47.069 --> 00:08:49.780
I don't know maybe for like a
day. freshman year.

148
00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:50.948
There it is.

149
00:08:50.989 --> 00:08:53.575
No. but I obviously don't
have a thing for you now.

150
00:08:53.617 --> 00:08:54.451
Why don't you have a thing for
me now?

151
00:08:54.952 --> 00:08:56.161
Why don't you have a thing for
me now?

152
00:08:56.203 --> 00:09:01.541
I think I do actually. as of
about an hour and a half ago.

153
00:09:03.335 --> 00:09:04.294
But if you aren't interested-

154
00:09:04.336 --> 00:09:05.254
I'm interested.

Well. I know we cancelled Thanksgiving

184
00:11:39.408 --> 00:11:43.412
with my parents last year
because of your shoot in Peru.

185
00:11:43.453 --> 00:11:45.831
Marie's being a real Marie about it.

186
00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:48.750
Yeah. Acton for
Thanksgiving's a good idea.

187
00:11:48.792 --> 00:11:51.503
Yeah. we should probably
tell them the news in person.

188
00:11:51.545 --> 00:11:52.379
What news?

189
00:11:56.842 --> 00:12:00.011
Past six years been
the greatest adventure

190
00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:01.471
I could have ever dreamt of.

191
00:12:01.513 --> 00:12:03.890

196
00:12:16.445 --> 00:12:18.447

She's right. we wouldn't
want to ruin her big day.

The bookseller's
daughter strikes again.

205
00:13:11.249 --> 00:13:12.417
Should we get married.

I can't not fly to Alaska.

222

This is my chance to shoot
a real documentary.

223
00:14:33.123 --> 00:14:37.335
It's also our first anniversary.

224
00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:39.879
You're right. I'm sorry.

225
00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:43.925
We'll celebrate big when I
get back. okay. I promise.

226
00:14:43.967 --> 00:14:48.555
We'll get a cheap flight
somewhere to like. Iceland.

227
00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:53.560
Croatia.
Bali?

228
00:14:54.686 --> 00:14:56.521
Maybe just dinner on
the beach down the street.

229
00:14:56.563 --> 00:14:59.065
Okay. dinner on the
beach down the street.

230
00:14:59.107 --> 00:15:00.150
It's a date.

231
00:15:00.191 --> 00:15:01.067
Okay.

232
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:03.403
Love you past forever.

233
00:15:03.445 --> 00:15:04.112
Love you longer than that.

234
00:15:04.154 --> 00:15:05.655
Do you know how long that is?

235
00:15:05.697 --> 00:15:06.656
Really long time.

236
00:15:06.698 --> 00:15:07.574
So long.

237
00:15:31.181 --> 00:15:32.432
Your husband
was on a helicopter

238
00:15:32.474 --> 00:15:34.476
that went down yesterday in the Pacific.

239
00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:37.395
We found the remains of both pilots.

240
00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:40.273
but we've not yet found your husband.

241
00:15:40.315 --> 00:15:41.274
And we do not believe

242
00:15:41.316 --> 00:15:43.443
he would've been able
to survive the crash.

243
00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:47.155
I'm so sorry.

244
00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:53.119
We're still searching.
let you know right away.

245
00:16:07.717 --> 00:16:12.514
Emma. it's your third day out here.

246
00:16:12.555 --> 00:16:15.558
I'm gonna stay out
here. as long as it takes.

247
00:16:17.352 --> 00:16:19.104
As long as what takes?

248
00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:23.274
He's lost and he's coming
back. and I'm gonna be here.

249
00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:24.526
You- you can't.

250
00:16:26.027 --> 00:16:28.530
I mean. that that won't work.

251
00:16:28.571 --> 00:16:30.281
I'm not giving up on him.

252
00:16:30.323 --> 00:16:31.991
Emma. give me the binoculars.

253
00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:33.118
No. Jesse's coming back.

254
00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:34.369
He was a long distance swimmer.

255
00:16:34.411 --> 00:16:36.413
He was the best in state. he can
do this.

256
00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:38.707
He's not coming back.

257
00:16:38.748 --> 00:16:40.333
You don't know that.

258
00:16:41.835 --> 00:16:45.463
Yeah Em. I do. it's been a week.

259
00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:47.132
They've given up the search.

260
00:16:49.342 --> 00:16:51.803
You just can't stand that
I'm no longer in your shadow.

261
00:16:51.845 --> 00:16:54.264
Well. I know my husband and
I know how incredible he is.

262
00:16:54.305 --> 00:16:57.100
And I'm not gonna let you
say he's anything less

263
00:16:57.142 --> 00:16:59.352
because you like it
better when I feel small.

264
00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:03.106
Emma.

265
00:17:03.148 --> 00:17:03.481
No.

266
00:17:03.523 --> 00:17:03.982
Emma.

267
00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:04.524
Don't console me.

268
00:17:05.734 --> 00:17:07.110
I'm so sorry. Emma.

269
00:17:09.154 --> 00:17:11.030
He's dead. I'm so sorry.

270
00:17:14.826 --> 00:17:16.286
No. he is not.

271
00:17:17.787 --> 00:17:19.122
No. he is not.

272
00:17:19.164 --> 00:17:20.331
Yeah.

273
00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:21.666
No. he is not.

274
00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:26.713
I'm sorry.

275
00:17:26.755 --> 00:17:29.674
No. he's not dead.

276
00:17:29.716 --> 00:17:30.675
I'm sorry.

277
00:17:32.635 --> 00:17:33.720
I'm so sorry.

278
00:17:42.312 --> 00:17:43.688
I don't know-

279
00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:47.108
I don't know how I can live
without him.

280
00:17:48.109 --> 00:17:48.777
I know.

281
00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:54.073
I know. but you will.

282
00:17:55.492 --> 00:17:56.284
How?

283
00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:58.787
You're gonna come home to Acton

284
00:17:58.828 --> 00:18:03.166
and you're gonna move in
with me and I'm gonna make

285
00:18:03.208 --> 00:18:05.710
your breakfast and your
lunches and your dinners

286
00:18:05.752 --> 00:18:09.672
and we're just gonna build you a
new life.

287
00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:14.093
But not right now.

288
00:18:15.762 --> 00:18:20.767
Now you get to just be broken
and I'll hold you together.

289
00:18:23.853 --> 00:18:25.188
I'll hold you together.

290
00:18:41.663 --> 00:18:46.125
Hey. walking down memory lane?

291
00:18:46.918 --> 00:18:49.462
Sorry. did I wake you?

292
00:18:49.504 --> 00:18:50.380
No. not at all.

293
00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:54.592
How are you feeling?

294
00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:55.635
I can't sleep.

295
00:18:57.762 --> 00:18:58.763
How are you feeling?

296
00:19:00.598 --> 00:19:01.474
I don't know.

297
00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:06.604
How about I run you a hot
shower?

298
00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:08.189
Give the old Sam Lee special.

299
00:19:09.315 --> 00:19:10.900
What's the Sam Lee special?

300
00:19:12.569 --> 00:19:14.654
Well. it's me turning on the shower.

301
00:20:20.261 --> 00:20:20.929
Oh. hey honey.

302
00:20:23.556 --> 00:20:24.682
Emma.

303
00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:26.517
I don't like that you're
understocking the classics.

304
00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:29.020
Obviously dad. but not now.

305
00:20:29.062 --> 00:20:31.397
I am not understocking the classics.

306
00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:32.273
You are overstocking the classics.

307
00:20:32.315 --> 00:20:33.816
Colin. focus.

308
00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:34.901
Sorry.

309
00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:38.237
We'll give you some space.

310
00:20:42.367 --> 00:20:45.453
So how are you. really?

311
00:20:48.665 --> 00:20:50.708
I don't know how I'm feeling.

312
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:53.795
I mean. you're probably
feeling confused.

313
00:20:53.836 --> 00:20:54.879
I mean. yeah.

314
00:20:54.921 --> 00:20:57.298
I wasn't finished. you and Jesse.

315
00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.342
you had this beautiful life together

316
00:20:59.384 --> 00:21:02.512
and then he got on a
helicopter and it crashed.

317
00:21:02.553 --> 00:21:04.555
And we all thought he was dead.

318
00:21:04.597 --> 00:21:07.350
And you. you picked yourself up

319
00:21:07.392 --> 00:21:09.936
like this incredible person that
you are.

320
00:21:09.978 --> 00:21:12.730
And you found love again with a
great guy.

321
00:21:12.772 --> 00:21:13.606
Right-

322
00:21:13.648 --> 00:21:15.274
I'm still not finished.

323
00:21:15.316 --> 00:21:16.818
And now what is probably the
happiest day of your life

324
00:21:16.859 --> 00:21:20.780
is also the most complicated
and probably saddest day.

325
00:21:20.822 --> 00:21:23.700
Because no matter what
you do or how you feel.

326
00:21:23.741 --> 00:21:25.785
you're gonna break somebody's
heart.

327
00:21:25.827 --> 00:21:28.746
You've gained something
and you'll lose something.

328
00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:31.791
So it's okay to feel
happy and heartbroken.

329
00:21:35.795 --> 00:21:37.797
Oh. you can talk. I'm done.

330
00:21:37.839 --> 00:21:42.844
Oh. that was incredibly
verbose. but accurate.

331
00:21:43.678 --> 00:21:44.554
Thank you.

332
00:21:46.764 --> 00:21:49.726
Why did I spend my childhood
hating you?

333
00:21:49.767 --> 00:21:50.810
Because I hated you.

334
00:21:51.978 --> 00:21:52.895
Well. why did you hate me?

335
00:21:52.937 --> 00:21:54.981
Because you hated me.

336
00:21:55.023 --> 00:21:59.318
Oh my God. Emma. you
can't wear that to reunite

337
00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.320
with your long lost husband.

338
00:22:03.823 --> 00:22:06.826
Oh my God. amazing.

339
00:22:10.455 --> 00:22:11.789
The color. the color.

340
00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:14.792
Well. I think this works.

341
00:22:14.834 --> 00:22:17.336
I'm just not so sure about this.

342
00:22:17.378 --> 00:22:19.380
I'm engaged and I'm also married.

343
00:22:19.422 --> 00:22:20.882
I'm not sure what the protocol is.

344
00:22:20.923 --> 00:22:22.008
What does your gut tell you?

345
00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:23.342
To throw up. mostly.

346
00:22:24.844 --> 00:22:26.679
Oh yeah. you could wear that one.

347
00:22:26.721 --> 00:22:29.515
Yeah. or you could wear both.

348
00:22:29.557 --> 00:22:32.643
I just won't wear either.

349
00:22:32.685 --> 00:22:35.772
Okay. here we go.

350
00:22:35.813 --> 00:22:37.356
Oh. okay.

351
00:22:38.107 --> 00:22:38.983
Go get him.

352
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:57.627
Hey Joe. Francine.

353
00:22:57.668 --> 00:22:59.087
Emma.

354
00:22:59.128 --> 00:23:02.048
Wow. you look different.

355
00:23:09.222 --> 00:23:10.973
Your boy's coming home. Frannie.

356
00:23:12.809 --> 00:23:15.019
Oh. we decided not to tell Jesse

357
00:23:15.061 --> 00:23:16.938
that you've already moved on.

358
00:23:16.979 --> 00:23:19.732
He's been through enough. don't

Janice.

382
00:25:31.822 --> 00:25:33.824
Hi. we were just talking about you.

383
00:25:33.866 --> 00:25:36.535
Behind your back.

384
00:25:40.206 --> 00:25:41.582
Actually. that's my lunch.

385
00:25:41.624 --> 00:25:42.541
Guess now we're even.

386
00:25:46.629 --> 00:25:47.838
I swore if I ever made it back
to you.

387
00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.966
I'd just tell you how sorry I
was for leaving.

388
00:25:51.592 --> 00:25:54.095
I'm going to spend the rest of
our lives

389
00:25:54.136 --> 00:25:55.137
making it up to you.

390
00:25:57.223 --> 00:25:58.307
I'm engaged.

391
00:25:59.934 --> 00:26:00.810
What.

392
00:26:02.144 --> 00:26:04.605
I'm engaged to be married.

393
00:26:05.898 --> 00:26:07.275
You are married?

394
00:26:07.316 --> 00:26:09.694
No. to someone else.

395
00:26:18.703 --> 00:26:19.704
What?

396
00:26:27.086 --> 00:26:28.879
What. what is so funny?

397
00:26:28.921 --> 00:26:31.632
It's not. no. it's
just horrible.

398
00:26:33.676 --> 00:26:35.344
Yeah. it's terrible.

399
00:26:37.263 --> 00:26:38.347
You know. I think that's the
worst thing

400
00:26:38.389 --> 00:26:39.598
I've ever been told.

401
00:26:45.855 --> 00:26:47.690
Jesse. I didn't know that you
were-

402
00:26:47.732 --> 00:26:50.276
You thought I was dead. You
didn't know.

403
00:26:52.486 --> 00:26:54.238
There you are. you can't
just disappear like that.

404
00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.865
Come on. everybody's waiting
for you.

405
00:26:55.906 --> 00:26:56.782
Come on.

406
00:27:03.289 --> 00:27:04.123
It's too much.

407
00:27:05.082 --> 00:27:07.209
It's okay. just breathe.

408
00:27:08.294 --> 00:27:11.380
Hey. hey. hey. hey. I'm here.

409
00:27:11.422 --> 00:27:16.635
It's been a long time since
I've seen so many people.

410
00:27:19.347 --> 00:27:20.348
I should get going.

411
00:27:22.683 --> 00:27:24.977
Yeah. I'll stay here tonight

412
00:27:25.019 --> 00:27:27.313
'cause they really need me.

413
00:27:28.773 --> 00:27:30.733
But then I need to be with you.

414
00:27:30.775 --> 00:27:32.860
Can we go somewhere tomorrow?

415
00:27:32.902 --> 00:27:34.070
Of course.

416
00:27:34.111 --> 00:27:36.655
Let's go to Maine.
let's go to the cabin.

417
00:27:36.697 --> 00:27:37.740
Sure.

418
00:27:37.782 --> 00:27:38.657
First thing.

419
00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.285
Yeah. first thing.

420
00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.797
Hey. you're home.

421
00:27:52.838 --> 00:27:54.131
You're still making me a
grilled cheese

422
00:27:54.173 --> 00:27:55.925
with dairy-free cheddar?

423
00:27:55.966 --> 00:27:58.969
Yeah well. I figured just in
case you came back. you know.

424
00:27:59.929 --> 00:28:02.181
my little lactose intolerant.

425
00:28:02.223 --> 00:28:09.397
So how is he? still very.
very. very. very handsome.

426
00:28:10.981 --> 00:28:13.275
He seems good.

427
00:28:13.317 --> 00:28:16.070
I'm a little overwhelmed. but good.

428
00:28:16.112 --> 00:28:17.696
Good mostly.

429
00:28:17.738 --> 00:28:19.907
Good.

430
00:28:21.492 --> 00:28:22.868
Good that he seems good.

431
00:28:26.956 --> 00:28:31.961
I saw you kissing him on the news.

432
00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.799
I'm not upset about it.

433
00:28:36.841 --> 00:28:41.846
I just... not telling
you felt wrong somehow.

434
00:28:41.887 --> 00:28:44.056
So I just wanted you to know.

435
00:28:46.058 --> 00:28:47.351
I'm really sorry. Sam.

436
00:28:47.393 --> 00:28:49.186
This has all been so-

437
00:28:49.228 --> 00:28:51.397
Confusing. it's confusing.

438
00:28:56.277 --> 00:28:59.113
Hey. it's gonna be all right.

439
00:29:00.406 --> 00:29:01.490
It's gonna be okay.

440
00:29:02.283 --> 00:29:03.159
Okay.

441
00:29:03.951 --> 00:29:06.829
I love you so much. Sam.

442
00:29:06.871 --> 00:29:07.872
I love you.

443
00:29:33.063 --> 00:29:34.023
I need you.

444
00:29:46.452 --> 00:29:47.828
Are you sure?

445
00:29:48.621 --> 00:29:49.455
Yeah.

446
00:30:16.148 --> 00:30:17.149
Where's your ring?

447
00:30:32.498 --> 00:30:34.500
You are gonna have to choose.
you know.

448
00:30:40.005 --> 00:30:42.174
I mean. he's your husband.

449
00:30:49.014 --> 00:30:50.933
I think we should call off the wedding.

450
00:30:53.352 --> 00:30:54.979
What?

451
00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.021
I mean. can you honestly say

452
00:30:56.063 --> 00:30:58.190
that no matter what
happens from this moment on

453
00:30:58.232 --> 00:30:59.942
that you're ready to spend

454
00:30:59.984 --> 00:31:01.360
the rest of your life with me?

455
00:31:12.496 --> 00:31:16.875
If we're gonna have a
future. you gotta go.

456
00:31:18.961 --> 00:31:21.088
You gotta go and do
whatever you need to do

457
00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:22.131
in order to know.

458
00:31:24.216 --> 00:31:25.259
I could stay at a hotel

459
00:31:25.301 --> 00:31:27.469
or you could stay at Marie
or your parent's. but-

460
00:31:27.511 --> 00:31:29.096
No. I get it.

461

Oh my.

487
00:33:08.153 --> 00:33:09.613
Would you run the store?

488
00:33:09.655 --> 00:33:10.489
Are you able to?

489
00:33:11.573 --> 00:33:13.325
Yeah. I'd be happy to.

490
00:33:15.536 --> 00:33:18.997

with two people at the same
time?

Maybe some people can.

493
00:33:24.586 --> 00:33:28.507
I don't even think
that's the point though.

494
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:32.636
You're a different person with
Sam than you were with Jesse.

495
00:33:32.678 --> 00:33:36.473
And maybe it's not
about who you love more.

496
00:33:36.515 --> 00:33:38.517
Maybe it's about whether
you wanna be the person

497
00:33:38.559 --> 00:33:41.019
you could be with Jesse

498
00:33:41.061 --> 00:33:44.106
or the person that
you're becoming with Sam.

499
00:33:45.149 --> 00:33:48.026
Wow. you're good lately.

500
00:33:48.068 --> 00:33:49.111
I just know you.

501
00:34:55.511 --> 00:34:56.470
You look great.

502
00:34:59.348 --> 00:35:00.224
You do.

503
00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.644
Oh. you gotta drive the whole way.

504
00:35:03.685 --> 00:35:06.605
My license expired when they
issued my death certificate.

505
00:35:06.647 --> 00:35:08.232
Okay.

506
00:35:08.273 --> 00:35:09.358
Good times.

507
00:36:14.923 --> 00:36:17.259
Hey. do you mind if
we stop by the store?

508
00:36:17.301 --> 00:36:19.469
I guess I left some stuff
at Marie's last night.

509
00:36:19.511 --> 00:36:22.806
Sure. Your stuff isn't at
your place?

510
00:36:22.848 --> 00:36:24.683
No. I'm not currently at my place.

511
00:36:25.684 --> 00:36:26.643
Okay.

512
00:36:27.603 --> 00:36:29.563
I'm looking forward to seeing everyone.

513
00:36:29.605 --> 00:36:31.315
Your parents still
recommending Walden Pond?

514
00:36:31.356 --> 00:36:32.691
To anyone who walks in
and then going.

515
00:36:32.733 --> 00:36:34.943
"You know. Walden Pond is just
down the road."

516
00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.946
Well. my parents are retired now.

517
00:36:37.988 --> 00:36:40.490
Really? Good for them.

518
00:36:40.532 --> 00:36:42.993
So Marie's finally inherited her
birthright?

519
00:36:43.035 --> 00:36:45.871
The bookseller's daughter
has become the book seller.

520
00:36:45.913 --> 00:36:48.999
Actually. I run it.

521
00:36:49.041 --> 00:36:50.417
Oh yeah. you run it.

522
00:36:50.459 --> 00:36:52.419
No. I'm serious. I run the bookstore.

523
00:36:53.712 --> 00:36:54.671
Oh.

524
00:36:54.713 --> 00:36:58.592
I know. I used to
hate it. but I lost you

525
00:36:58.634 --> 00:37:03.639
and I had nothing. so I moved
back home and there it was.

526
00:37:05.557 --> 00:37:06.892
Em.

527
00:37:06.934 --> 00:37:07.809
What?

528
00:37:09.728 --> 00:37:10.687
Come on. let's go.

529
00:37:22.491 --> 00:37:24.326
You are a sight for sore eyes.

530
00:37:24.368 --> 00:37:27.454
We are so happy you're okay. Jesse.

531
00:37:27.496 --> 00:37:28.997
Yeah. I missed you guys too.

532
00:37:29.039 --> 00:37:29.915
Hi.

533
00:37:31.333 --> 00:37:34.795
God. a real life
Odysseus is back to Ithaka.

534
00:37:34.836 --> 00:37:37.464
It's good to see
you're still reading. sis.

535
00:37:37.506 --> 00:37:38.507
Hi Sophie.

536
00:37:44.304 --> 00:37:46.390
You're hungry?

537
00:37:46.431 --> 00:37:49.309
Wait a minute. I want you to
meet someone.

538
00:37:51.103 --> 00:37:54.398
Jesse. this is my daughter Sophie.

539
00:37:54.439 --> 00:37:57.526
Sophie. this is Jesse.

540
00:37:58.819 --> 00:37:59.903
Hey.

541
00:38:00.946 --> 00:38:01.863
Okay. hey.

542
00:38:03.073 --> 00:38:04.074
Welcome back.

543
00:38:04.116 --> 00:38:05.117
Thank you. good to see you.

544
00:38:05.158 --> 00:38:09.454
I guess a lot's happened
since you've been gone.

545
00:38:09.496 --> 00:38:10.706
She is adorable.

546
00:38:11.665 --> 00:38:12.541
Congratulations.

547
00:38:12.582 --> 00:38:13.458
Thank you.

548
00:38:14.334 --> 00:38:15.085
Say hi to Mike for me.

549
00:38:15.127 --> 00:38:16.962
You can tell him yourself. hey.

550
00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:19.506
How you been?

551
00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:22.300
Stranded on a desert island. man.

552
00:38:22.342 --> 00:38:23.010
Oh right.

553
00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:26.596
Must have been nice to get away.

554
00:38:27.472 --> 00:38:28.348
For a bit. yeah.

555
00:38:29.391 --> 00:38:30.851
We should hit the road.

556
00:38:30.892 --> 00:38:32.477
Yeah.

557
00:38:32.519 --> 00:38:35.063
We're gonna head to the
cabin. just for a couple days.

558
00:38:35.105 --> 00:38:37.441
Thank you.

559
00:38:37.482 --> 00:38:40.318
Yeah.

560
00:38:41.486 --> 00:38:44.489
Actually. can I drive?

561
00:38:44.531 --> 00:38:45.615
Without a license?

562
00:38:45.657 --> 00:38:47.534
Well. it's a technicality.

563
00:38:49.036 --> 00:38:50.078
Come on. it'd be fun.

564
00:38:50.996 --> 00:38:52.330
Okay.

565
00:38:52.372 --> 00:38:53.040
Thank you.

566
00:38:57.002 --> 00:38:57.836
Morning.

567
00:38:57.878 --> 00:38:58.712
Good morning.

568
00:38:58.754 --> 00:39:00.380
Morning. Mr. Lee.

569
00:39:00.422 --> 00:39:02.924
Liz. you are a trumpet player.
please spit out your gum.

570
00:39:02.966 --> 00:39:04.968
Rest of you. let's jump right in.

571
00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:10.015
So Debussy is considered our
first impressionist composer.

572
00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:15.937
Impressionist. can anybody
tell me what that means. Zoe?

573
00:39:15.979 --> 00:39:18.148
It doesn't have a melody or something.

574
00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:18.982
Right. right.

575
00:39:19.024 --> 00:39:22.152
Debussy was less concerned about
a melody

576
00:39:22.194 --> 00:39:27.365
and more about evoking
a mood and an emotion.

577
00:39:31.661 --> 00:39:33.663
He used notes like a paintbrush.

578
00:39:33.705 --> 00:39:36.041
painting colors that
conveyed an impression.

579
00:39:39.628 --> 00:39:43.840
So what moods are being
conveyed right now?

580
00:39:43.882 --> 00:39:45.509
Go ahead. shout them out.

581
00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:46.676
Sadness.

582
00:39:46.718 --> 00:39:47.594
Loneliness.

583
00:39:48.386 --> 00:39:50.388
Fear you might lose Emma forever.

584
00:39:52.182 --> 00:39:53.391
Really. really. Zoe?

585
00:39:53.433 --> 00:39:55.435
You got that from the song?

586
00:39:55.477 --> 00:39:57.437
No. I got that from how
you were playing the song.

587
00:39:57.479 --> 00:39:58.814
I mean. are we really not
gonna talk

588
00:39:58.855 --> 00:40:00.565
about your husband in-law?

589
00:40:00.607 --> 00:40:01.525
My what?

590
00:40:01.566 --> 00:40:02.359
The guy that's married
to your wife. man.

591
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:05.028
Your brother- husband. or whatever.

592
00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:07.072
Marcus. he's not my
brother- husband.

593
00:40:07.114 --> 00:40:08.740
Oh you know. my cousin
is in a closed quad

594
00:40:08.782 --> 00:40:09.699
and it really works for them.

595
00:40:09.741 --> 00:40:11.868
So I don't see why a triple
can't work.

596
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:14.538
Okay. first of all. Dylan.
it's called a throuple and-

597
00:40:14.579 --> 00:40:17.040
Okay. we're not having this conversation.

598
00:40:17.082 --> 00:40:18.834
All right. let's go. instruments up.

599
00:40:18.875 --> 00:40:19.543
Oh. whoa. whoa.

600
00:40:19.584 --> 00:40:21.545
Hey. Clair de Lune. come on.

601
00:40:22.754 --> 00:40:24.422
I'm trying to get palm reading.

602
00:40:24.464 --> 00:40:25.841
No. no. no. no. no.

603
00:40:25.882 --> 00:40:28.802
Okay. the most romantic
place we ever went to.

604
00:40:28.844 --> 00:40:29.719
Ooh.

605
00:40:30.512 --> 00:40:35.642
I know I'm supposed to say Paris.

606
00:40:35.684 --> 00:40:39.062
But it's
Amsterdam.

607
00:40:39.104 --> 00:40:40.063
Yeah.

608
00:40:40.105 --> 00:40:41.148
New Year's Eve.

609
00:40:41.189 --> 00:40:45.861
We fought about that stupid
bike lock until 11:59.

610
00:40:45.902 --> 00:40:46.778
Yeah.

611
00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:49.447
And then the clock turned
and you said.

612
00:40:49.489 --> 00:40:50.407
"Well. I don't care who lost it.

613
00:40:50.448 --> 00:40:52.617
I just wanna spend my whole year
with you."

614
00:40:53.577 --> 00:40:54.953
And then you kissed me

615
00:40:54.995 --> 00:40:59.916
and then felt like nothing
mattered except us.

616
00:41:01.501 --> 00:41:02.294
And you're right.

617
00:41:03.795 --> 00:41:06.047
You did lose that lock. by the way.

618
00:41:06.089 --> 00:41:08.842
No. you lost the lock by the river.

619
00:41:08.884 --> 00:41:09.759
No. no.

620
00:41:10.677 --> 00:41:11.595
I've had a lot of time to think
about this

621
00:41:11.636 --> 00:41:14.723
and I have decided I
remember you losing it.

622
00:41:14.764 --> 00:41:15.807
Okay.

623
00:41:15.849 --> 00:41:17.225
Agree to disagree.

624
00:41:17.267 --> 00:41:18.143
Okay.

625
00:41:39.831 --> 00:41:41.833
Hey. come on.

626
00:41:43.001 --> 00:41:43.835
Our cabin awaits.

627
00:41:58.767 --> 00:42:00.518
Oh. come on.

628
00:42:03.855 --> 00:42:07.025
Tuba. Come on. tuba. get it together.

629
00:42:07.067 --> 00:42:07.984
I thought I did pretty good.

630
00:42:08.026 --> 00:42:11.238
You are Marcus. yeah.
you are. you're great.

631
00:42:11.279 --> 00:42:15.825
You're.

632
00:42:15.867 --> 00:42:16.868
Great.

633
00:42:24.751 --> 00:42:25.794
We haven't been here since-

634
00:42:25.835 --> 00:42:26.711
Our wedding.

635
00:42:27.712 --> 00:42:29.881
Right. that whole thing.

636
00:42:39.683 --> 00:42:40.809
Do you want a drink?

637
00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:41.643
Please.

638
00:42:41.685 --> 00:42:42.435
Okay. great.

639
00:42:42.477 --> 00:42:44.145
Let's see what we can find here.

640
00:42:54.406 --> 00:42:56.116
So you can build a fire now?

641
00:42:57.284 --> 00:42:58.702
So you get tattoos now.

642
00:43:03.748 --> 00:43:05.834
I guess a lot has changed.

643
00:43:05.875 --> 00:43:07.085
Some things. yeah. sure.

644
00:43:08.712 --> 00:43:11.715
But nothing that really matters.
To us.

645
00:43:14.926 --> 00:43:15.760
Finally.

646
00:43:17.387 --> 00:43:18.263
Finally.

647
00:43:29.774 --> 00:43:35.864
Smooth.

648
00:43:38.158 --> 00:43:39.701
What does it say?

649
00:43:41.077 --> 00:43:41.953
Oh.

650
00:43:46.124 --> 00:43:48.001
"And so I walked on."

651
00:44:03.433 --> 00:44:05.643
I'll never leave your side again.

652
00:44:11.775 --> 00:44:18.782
All I ever wanted was. one
more day to be with you.

653
00:44:32.462 --> 00:44:36.966
I missed your face. I missed
your face. I missed your-

654
00:44:39.469 --> 00:44:41.721
I missed the feel of you.

655
00:47:10.078 --> 00:47:10.954
Jesse.

656
00:47:17.293 --> 00:47:22.298
Just turns on when you need
it. off when you don't.

657
00:47:24.926 --> 00:47:25.593
Yeah.

658
00:47:27.262 --> 00:47:28.429
Faucets are wild. huh?

659
00:47:31.182 --> 00:47:32.392
What happened out there?

660
00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:41.401
Nah. I just wanna focus on us
right now.

661
00:47:43.403 --> 00:47:45.446
I'll tell you what I do need.

662
00:47:45.488 --> 00:47:49.909
I mean. what I really. really need.

663
00:47:53.204 --> 00:47:54.080
Breakfast.

664
00:47:55.123 --> 00:47:57.417
Oh. you're such a jerk.

665
00:47:57.458 --> 00:47:58.293
You know that?

666
00:47:58.334 --> 00:47:59.210
Yeah.

667
00:48:01.087 --> 00:48:02.547
Mr. Lee. just a couple questions.

668
00:48:02.589 --> 00:48:03.506
Oh shit.

669
00:48:03.548 --> 00:48:06.092
Mr. Lee. is the wedding off?

670
00:48:06.134 --> 00:48:07.594
Is- is Emma here. is she here?

671
00:48:07.635 --> 00:48:09.470
Can we just get a little
privacy please?

672
00:48:09.512 --> 00:48:11.180
"We". does that mean you're
still getting married?

673
00:48:11.222 --> 00:48:12.432
No. I- I-

674
00:48:12.473 --> 00:48:13.391
It's off?

675
00:48:13.433 --> 00:48:14.976
I honestly don't know.

676
00:48:15.226 --> 00:48:16.644
Are you afraid that your
fiance's gonna leave you

677
00:48:16.686 --> 00:48:18.021
and go back to her husband?

678
00:48:18.062 --> 00:48:20.106
Sam. have you talked to Jesse
yet?

679
00:48:20.148 --> 00:48:22.400
Can you give us any
details about the wedding?

680
00:48:27.697 --> 00:48:28.656
Feel a little bad

681
00:48:28.698 --> 00:48:30.241
you had to move back to
New England. it's cold.

682
00:48:30.283 --> 00:48:32.285
You don't have to feel bad.

683
00:48:32.327 --> 00:48:34.954
I'm just glad that neither
of us is stuck anymore

684
00:48:34.996 --> 00:48:38.708
and we can start living
again. go travelling.

685
00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:42.170
Travelling. you don't
wanna settle somewhere safe.

686
00:48:42.211 --> 00:48:43.129
We have home base.

687
00:48:43.171 --> 00:48:47.050
Sure. but now I was thinking
Venice Beach.

688
00:48:47.091 --> 00:48:48.718
anywhere in California would be good.

689
00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:49.719
I mean. was the best time of our lives.

690
00:48:49.761 --> 00:48:52.055
Mexican food was top notch.

691
00:48:52.096 --> 00:48:54.307
And you can work from
anywhere. right?

692
00:48:54.349 --> 00:48:56.392
Travel. writting. riding could
be wherever we want.

693
00:48:56.434 --> 00:49:00.355
Well. I haven't written
a travel piece in years.

694
00:49:01.272 --> 00:49:02.106
Really?

695
00:49:03.149 --> 00:49:05.568
I know you do the store. but I
just assumed

696
00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:10.198
you were still doing
what you wanted it to do.

697
00:49:10.239 --> 00:49:12.533
The store. it is what I wanna do.

698
00:49:12.575 --> 00:49:15.995
You know. I like seeing the regulars.

699
00:49:16.037 --> 00:49:18.414
getting a crack at the new releases.

700
00:49:18.456 --> 00:49:19.332
This coming from the girl

701
00:49:19.374 --> 00:49:20.583
that wouldn't read the "Hunger
Games?"

702
00:49:20.625 --> 00:49:23.211
Well. turns out the "Hunger
Games" is actually pretty great.

703
00:49:24.295 --> 00:49:25.505
Hey. how you doing?

704
00:49:25.546 --> 00:49:28.091
Could we please have two bacon.

705
00:49:28.132 --> 00:49:30.176
egg and cheese biscuits
with home fries. please?

706
00:49:30.218 --> 00:49:32.553
Actually. I don't eat cheese anymore.

707
00:49:32.595 --> 00:49:34.138
It's like a whole thing.

708
00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:35.098
Okay.

709
00:49:35.139 --> 00:49:36.516
One egg and cheese biscuit with
home fries

710
00:49:36.557 --> 00:49:38.101
and my beautiful wife-

711
00:49:38.142 --> 00:49:40.019
Fried egg on toast.

712
00:49:41.145 --> 00:49:43.064
Fried egg on toast.

713
00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:45.066
Yes.

714
00:49:46.192 --> 00:49:49.362
Emerson and Alcott and
Thoreau were all from Concord.

715
00:49:50.488 --> 00:49:53.658
I had a lot of time to do
reading while you were gone.

716
00:49:54.659 --> 00:49:57.662
A lot of existential dread. you
might say.

717
00:49:59.205 --> 00:50:01.165
But you know what? Thoreau.
he knows what's up.

718
00:50:01.207 --> 00:50:02.750
And Walden Pond-

719
00:50:02.792 --> 00:50:04.627
Is just down the road.

720
00:50:05.545 --> 00:50:07.130
Yes. yes.

721
00:50:07.171 --> 00:50:10.007
Oh. and when the leaves change
in autumn.

722
00:50:12.719 --> 00:50:16.514
When you died. when I
thought you were dead.

723
00:50:17.682 --> 00:50:22.061
I had nothing and came back here.

724
00:50:23.104 --> 00:50:24.313
My parents and Marie.

725
00:50:25.231 --> 00:50:28.025
they basically nursed me back to life.

726
00:50:28.067 --> 00:50:31.446
They picked out all these
books to distract me.

727
00:50:31.487 --> 00:50:34.615
And that's when I read
"Hunger Games". by the way.

728
00:50:34.657 --> 00:50:41.622
And "Wild" and "Octavia
Butler" and "Joan Didion".

729
00:50:41.664 --> 00:50:45.168
And that's when I realized
that I wasn't alone.

730
00:50:48.379 --> 00:50:52.049
All these people that had. come
before me

731
00:50:52.091 --> 00:50:57.054
they. they felt this pain that I
felt and they found way through

732
00:50:57.096 --> 00:51:00.308
and. I could too.

733
00:51:03.728 --> 00:51:08.399
Then this place. this
place put me back together.

734
00:51:14.405 --> 00:51:17.533
You and I. we had this idea

735
00:51:17.575 --> 00:51:21.496
that our adventures
had to be grand. right?

736
00:51:21.537 --> 00:51:23.539
That we had to go to
Madrid and the Great Wall

737
00:51:23.581 --> 00:51:26.834
and go everywhere extraordinary.

738
00:51:26.876 --> 00:51:31.088
But extraordinary's everywhere.

739
00:51:32.715 --> 00:51:35.510
Running a bookstore and
being with our families

740
00:51:35.551 --> 00:51:39.096
and raising our kids here.
that's a great adventure.

741
00:51:45.561 --> 00:51:46.437
Kids?

742
00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:51.359
I wasn't sure you ever wanted to
have any.

743
00:51:53.402 --> 00:51:54.487
I wasn't sure either.

744
00:51:57.657 --> 00:51:58.533
But I am now.

745
00:51:59.450 --> 00:52:03.788
I could build a family here.
it's home.

746
00:52:08.793 --> 00:52:12.463
Well. I am very thankful to
this place

747
00:52:12.505 --> 00:52:14.215
for keeping such good care of you

748
00:52:15.550 --> 00:52:16.425
while I was gone.

749
00:52:30.648 --> 00:52:31.482
Sorry I'm late.

750
00:52:32.441 --> 00:52:33.317
It's all good.

751
00:52:35.319 --> 00:52:36.904
All right. everybody. Phones away.

752
00:52:38.239 --> 00:52:39.657
Seriously Debbie Sue. let's go.

753
00:52:41.826 --> 00:52:44.328
Put away the God damn phones!

754
00:52:47.665 --> 00:52:50.835
Sorry. that was excessive.

755
00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:54.547
I'm going through a real
stressful time right now.

756
00:52:54.589 --> 00:52:59.594
And wait. Penny. Tom. please
explain why you're in my class.

757
00:53:00.428 --> 00:53:02.221
We all wanna be here for you.

758
00:53:02.263 --> 00:53:04.390
In case you explode. we
wanted to watch it happen.

759
00:53:04.432 --> 00:53:08.269
And if you do explode. then
we wanna be there for you.

760
00:53:08.311 --> 00:53:09.478
Well. thank you.

761
00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:11.272
But I'm fine and you're not in orchestra.

762
00:53:11.314 --> 00:53:13.316
so please get out of my class.

763
00:53:13.357 --> 00:53:14.817
The rest of you. instruments up.

764
00:53:22.658 --> 00:53:23.868
Actually. can somebody please
tell me

765
00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:25.912
what the hell it means when someone

766
00:53:25.953 --> 00:53:28.706
is texting you for 18 hours

767
00:53:28.748 --> 00:53:30.416
and doesn't hit send?

768
00:53:30.458 --> 00:53:32.793
I mean. what the crap are these
dots?

769
00:53:32.835 --> 00:53:34.211
Is she texting me?

770
00:53:34.253 --> 00:53:35.588
Is she not texting me. is it
good news?

771
00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:36.589
Is it not good news?

772
00:53:36.631 --> 00:53:37.798
If I want it to be good news.

773
00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:40.259
does that make me a bad person?

774
00:53:40.301 --> 00:53:41.677
Is it selfish?

775
00:53:41.719 --> 00:53:45.514
Is it selfish to want
my fiance to be my wife?

776
00:53:45.556 --> 00:53:47.350
I mean. apparently it is.

777
00:53:47.391 --> 00:53:50.478
Well. I'm sorry that I
didn't survive a plane crash

778
00:53:50.519 --> 00:53:53.814
and spend four years on
some small island somewhere.

779
00:53:53.856 --> 00:53:55.983
I guess that makes me an asshole somehow.

780
00:53:58.778 --> 00:54:00.821
Of all the people in the world.

781
00:54:00.863 --> 00:54:02.782
why did it have to be him?

782
00:54:02.823 --> 00:54:04.951
Why is it always him?

783
00:54:07.954 --> 00:54:12.917
I met her first. I loved
her first. finders keepers.

784
00:54:14.627 --> 00:54:16.879
Not that she's some soccer
ball in the playground.

785
00:54:16.921 --> 00:54:18.798
Obviously she can
make her own decisions.

786
00:54:18.839 --> 00:54:20.967
as can all of the bright.

787
00:54:21.008 --> 00:54:23.552
capable young women
in this class.

788
00:54:23.594 --> 00:54:27.014
But I do think that finders
keepers applies here.

789
00:54:27.056 --> 00:54:28.349
No. no. I don't.

790
00:54:28.391 --> 00:54:29.183
No. I don't.

791
00:54:29.225 --> 00:54:30.476
That. that's the patriarchy talking

792
00:54:30.518 --> 00:54:33.479
and we must all fight it together.

793
00:54:45.741 --> 00:54:48.869
I just want her to love me
more than she loves him.

794
00:54:53.499 --> 00:54:56.335
Well. that was wildly inappropriate.

795
00:54:57.795 --> 00:54:58.796
I'm gonna stop.

796
00:54:58.838 --> 00:55:00.715
No man. for God's
sakes. just keep talking.

797
00:55:10.099 --> 00:55:12.101
Maybe we should go a bit slower.

798
00:55:12.143 --> 00:55:13.102
Really?

799
00:55:13.144 --> 00:55:14.603
Yeah.

800
00:55:14.645 --> 00:55:15.938
Come on. it's a little fun. right?

801
00:55:18.733 --> 00:55:19.692
This is not good.

802
00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:22.361
We'll be fine. it's okay.

803
00:55:22.403 --> 00:55:23.612
You don't have your license.

804
00:55:23.654 --> 00:55:25.489
It'll be good. it'll be good.

805
00:55:25.531 --> 00:55:26.282
I told you earlier.

806
00:55:26.323 --> 00:55:27.908
I said you don't have your license.

807
00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:33.456
Hello Officer. how can I help
you?

808
00:55:33.497 --> 00:55:36.667
You were speeding.
License and registration.

809
00:55:36.709 --> 00:55:38.419
That was an honest mistake. truly.

810
00:55:38.461 --> 00:55:39.837
And I'm very sorry.

811
00:55:39.879 --> 00:55:42.631
Maybe we could get off with the
warning?

812
00:55:42.673 --> 00:55:44.675
License and registration.

813
00:55:44.717 --> 00:55:45.801
I technically don't have it.

814
00:55:45.843 --> 00:55:49.764
He's been lost at sea.
maybe you've heard about it.

815
00:55:49.805 --> 00:55:51.849
It's been all over the news.

816
00:55:51.891 --> 00:55:53.768
If I could reach back.

817
00:55:53.809 --> 00:55:55.770
I can grab an article to show you.

818
00:56:03.903 --> 00:56:04.779
Here.

819
00:56:09.533 --> 00:56:10.868
This doesn't explain why
you're driving.

820
00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:12.661
let alone speeding.

821
00:56:12.703 --> 00:56:14.997
Oh. he just wanted everything

822
00:56:15.039 --> 00:56:18.375
to feel normal for once.
We both do.

823
00:56:20.878 --> 00:56:21.796
You have a license ma'am?

824
00:56:21.837 --> 00:56:23.422
Me? yes. yes I do.

825
00:56:38.479 --> 00:56:42.399
Okay. Ms. Blair. looks
like you're driving now.

826
00:57:13.139 --> 00:57:15.808
Please try to keep
it under 55. all right?

827
00:57:15.850 --> 00:57:16.725
Welcome home.

828
00:57:17.601 --> 00:57:18.602
Thank you.

829
00:57:24.024 --> 00:57:26.819
You changed your name back.

830
00:57:26.861 --> 00:57:29.905
I thought you were dead.

831
00:57:29.947 --> 00:57:31.866
So you went to the
social security office

832
00:57:31.907 --> 00:57:34.577
and changed your name back?

833
00:57:34.618 --> 00:57:37.121
There's more to it than that.

834
00:57:38.581 --> 00:57:39.456
Okay.

835
00:57:40.958 --> 00:57:43.210
She should be with the
person that she loves the most.

836
00:57:43.252 --> 00:57:46.547
Not necessarily the person
that loves her the most.

837
00:57:47.631 --> 00:57:50.551
because I love the most.
I love her the most.

838
00:57:51.927 --> 00:57:53.762
I know that everyone thinks
that he must love her the most

839
00:57:53.804 --> 00:57:55.598
because he survived the
desert island for her.

840
00:57:55.639 --> 00:57:58.225
But I comforted her while
he was on that island.

841
00:57:59.935 --> 00:58:04.064
You know. I sat with her
while she cried for him.

842
00:58:04.106 --> 00:58:08.903
And I figured out a way to love
someone with my whole heart.

843
00:58:08.944 --> 00:58:11.488
knowing that a part of
her would always love him.

844
00:58:13.532 --> 00:58:15.117
And I did that for her.

845
00:58:17.745 --> 00:58:19.663
Well. you should probably get
outta here.

846
00:58:19.705 --> 00:58:23.042
Oh yeah. like American Lit can
hold a candle to this drama.

847
00:58:23.083 --> 00:58:25.961
It's inappropriate to keep
you from your classes. Dylan.

848
00:58:27.129 --> 00:58:27.963
On the other hand.

849
00:58:28.005 --> 00:58:30.549
there's still a lot to
discuss here.

850
00:58:32.176 --> 00:58:33.177
All right. hit me.

851
00:58:40.809 --> 00:58:43.187
Honestly. you know what the
weirdest part about all this is?

852
00:58:45.022 --> 00:58:47.691
Everyone thinks they're the
hero of their own story.

853
00:58:48.275 --> 00:58:51.946
Everyone. maybe I'm not the hero.

854
00:58:56.367 --> 00:58:57.660
Maybe I'm the bad guy.

855
00:59:15.010 --> 00:59:16.637
Jesse. please.

856
00:59:17.596 --> 00:59:19.556
Jesse. talk to me. please.

857
00:59:20.724 --> 00:59:24.186
I was supposed to come home
to my wife who waited for me.

858
00:59:24.228 --> 00:59:25.688
Jesse. I did wait.

859
00:59:25.729 --> 00:59:27.231
You got engaged to someone else.

860
00:59:27.273 --> 00:59:29.066
Because I thought you were dead.

861
00:59:29.108 --> 00:59:30.025
So you replaced me.

862
00:59:30.067 --> 00:59:32.778
No. I didn't replace you. I
loved you.

863
00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:34.196
I still love you.

864
00:59:34.238 --> 00:59:35.739
This fiance. you love him too?

865
00:59:39.827 --> 00:59:41.829
Do you love him or not!?

866
00:59:42.955 --> 00:59:47.918
Yes. yes I love him.

867
00:59:51.714 --> 00:59:53.048
Do you love him more than me?

868
00:59:53.090 --> 00:59:54.341
Is he better than me?

869
00:59:54.383 --> 00:59:56.176
Jesse. no. it's not like that.

870
00:59:56.218 --> 00:59:58.053
Sam and I-

871
00:59:58.095 --> 00:59:59.054
So he's got a name.

872
00:59:59.096 --> 01:00:00.055
His name's Sam.

873
01:00:09.106 --> 01:00:09.982
Sam Lee.

874
01:00:13.736 --> 01:00:15.821
I bet this was a dream come true
for him.

875
01:00:15.863 --> 01:00:16.655
That is not fair.

876
01:00:16.697 --> 01:00:18.615
You have no idea what I went through.

877
01:00:18.657 --> 01:00:19.658
You went through.

878
01:00:21.368 --> 01:00:24.621
I was on a dead rock
for four years. alone.

879
01:00:26.123 --> 01:00:28.292
Starving and just trying not to die.

880
01:00:29.877 --> 01:00:33.881
That whole time you know
what I thought about? This.

881
01:00:35.299 --> 01:00:38.344
You. I just thought about us.

882
01:00:40.304 --> 01:00:42.389
Right now was supposed
to be the good time.

883
01:00:43.974 --> 01:00:46.643
I was supposed to come home
to a life I was missing.

884
01:00:50.356 --> 01:00:54.276
My part was to get back to
you and your part was to wait.

885
01:00:56.403 --> 01:01:00.783
I did my part Emma. what did you
do?

886
01:01:00.824 --> 01:01:02.368
I had to live my life.

887
01:01:05.496 --> 01:01:07.414
I had to learn how to live
without you.

888
01:01:11.794 --> 01:01:13.003
You managed to do that.

889
01:01:18.342 --> 01:01:19.134
Jesse.

890
01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:21.470
You know. they say if you love someone.

891
01:01:21.512 --> 01:01:23.472
you should set them free.

892
01:01:23.514 --> 01:01:27.101
I'm starting to realize
that if you love someone.

893
01:01:27.142 --> 01:01:29.436
you don't let anything stand in
your way.

894
01:01:29.478 --> 01:01:31.271
You shout it from the mountaintops.

895
01:01:31.313 --> 01:01:33.148
You race through traffic.

896
01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:36.735
You survived being
marooned on a desert island

897
01:01:36.777 --> 01:01:39.029
and swim for miles just
to get back to them.

898
01:01:39.071 --> 01:01:40.906
Son of a bitch. I'm screwed.

899
01:02:47.139 --> 01:02:48.182
Dear Jesse.

900
01:02:49.558 --> 01:02:51.894
You've been gone more
than three years now.

901
01:02:52.603 --> 01:02:55.772
but there hasn't been a day
when I haven't thought of you.

902
01:02:56.273 --> 01:02:59.359
At first. I refused to
admit you were gone.

903
01:03:02.154 --> 01:03:03.947
I couldn't sleep. I couldn't
eat.

904
01:03:07.868 --> 01:03:09.411
Even after the search was called off

905
01:03:09.453 --> 01:03:12.998
and they said you were dead.
it was so hard to let go.

906
01:03:14.833 --> 01:03:17.085
Hey. you've
tried to call Jesse Lerner.

907
01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:18.837
I obviously have better things
to do.

908
01:03:18.879 --> 01:03:21.298
so leave a message and I'll call
you back.

909
01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:22.257
I felt pain

910
01:03:22.299 --> 01:03:24.384
that I didn't think was humanly possible.

911
01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:28.805
At times. it nearly broke me.

912
01:03:30.974 --> 01:03:34.603
Hey. came across this at the store.

913
01:03:34.645 --> 01:03:37.940
It's by Joan Didion about
the death of her husband.

914
01:03:37.981 --> 01:03:39.441
I hate being given books.

915
01:03:39.483 --> 01:03:43.028
I know. just a shot in the dark.

916
01:03:43.070 --> 01:03:44.071
Just in case you wanted to read

917
01:03:44.112 --> 01:03:45.822
how someone else got through it.

918
01:03:53.038 --> 01:03:54.289
I mean. at least give me a
happy book.

919
01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:56.416
I don't wanna read about people dying.

920
01:03:56.458 --> 01:03:58.544
Okay. I can work with that.

921
01:03:58.585 --> 01:04:00.629
How about "Pride and Prejudice"?

922
01:04:00.671 --> 01:04:02.047
Or falling in love.

923
01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:05.384
Okay. wow.

924
01:04:06.426 --> 01:04:09.846
So no death or love.

925
01:04:10.556 --> 01:04:11.515
I'll make a list.

926
01:04:11.557 --> 01:04:14.560
There's gotta be like
three books in existence

927
01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:16.520
that don't deal with either.

928
01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:22.192
I used to
think grief was chronic.

929
01:04:22.234 --> 01:04:24.319
Just a never ending cycle of bad days

930
01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:26.405
with the occasional good day.

931
01:04:26.446 --> 01:04:28.865
No D or L. this one's
conquered.

932
01:04:30.492 --> 01:04:35.497
♪ Makes you tethered. tethered ♪

933
01:04:36.039 --> 01:04:40.043
♪ Trust when you fall
and every risk you take ♪

934
01:04:40.085 --> 01:04:44.172
♪ Knowing redemption's always on
its way ♪

935
01:04:44.214 --> 01:04:48.176
♪ Let all the courage start to
wake ♪

936
01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:51.930
♪ Unafraid. unafraid ♪

937
01:04:53.307 --> 01:04:57.144
♪ Unafraid. unafraid ♪

938
01:04:57.185 --> 01:04:58.103
♪ Unafraid. unafraid ♪

939
01:04:58.145 --> 01:05:01.898
You were right. I loved
it. what else you got?

940
01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:05.444
That can had love or
death in them. tons.

941
01:05:06.528 --> 01:05:07.529
But then I started to think

942
01:05:07.571 --> 01:05:09.489
that maybe the good days

943
01:05:09.531 --> 01:05:11.617
could be good weeks or good months.

944
01:05:14.369 --> 01:05:17.372
♪ Look for better measure.
measure ♪

945
01:05:17.414 --> 01:05:18.040
Oh. just say it.

946
01:05:18.081 --> 01:05:20.584
My baby's finally a bookworm.

947
01:05:23.253 --> 01:05:24.546
Doesn't mean that I
wanna let go of the memories

948
01:05:24.588 --> 01:05:27.049
of you or the love I have for you.

949
01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:30.552
but it does mean that I'm
ready to let go of the sadness.

950
01:05:34.264 --> 01:05:36.141
I will carry you with me always.

951
01:05:37.517 --> 01:05:40.395
but I cannot define myself
by the loss anymore.

952
01:05:40.437 --> 01:05:41.605
And that's four.

953
01:05:41.647 --> 01:05:43.565
But you already know that
'cause you're super good at it.

954
01:05:43.607 --> 01:05:45.651
So let me just play it you just
for fun.

955
01:05:52.532 --> 01:05:54.117
Emma?

956
01:05:54.159 --> 01:05:55.535
Sam?

957
01:05:55.577 --> 01:05:57.120
Here.

958
01:05:57.162 --> 01:05:58.163
Hi.

959
01:05:58.205 --> 01:05:59.581
Here. let me help you with that.

960
01:06:01.333 --> 01:06:03.669
Oh my God. It still works.

961
01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:04.169
Sorry.

962
01:06:04.211 --> 01:06:05.712
You're good.

963
01:06:05.754 --> 01:06:06.755
Yeah. you don't have to buy it.

964
01:06:06.797 --> 01:06:08.590
Oh my God. Hi.

965
01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:09.883
Hi.

966
01:06:09.925 --> 01:06:10.759
How are you?

967
01:06:10.801 --> 01:06:11.593
I'm good.

968
01:06:11.635 --> 01:06:12.469
Have you been...?

969
01:06:12.511 --> 01:06:13.970
Can't believe-

970
01:06:14.012 --> 01:06:15.013
I mean-

971
01:06:15.055 --> 01:06:17.099
Yeah. you look. yeah wow.

972
01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:17.766
Emma Blair.

973
01:06:17.808 --> 01:06:19.434
Wow. can't believe it.

974
01:06:38.328 --> 01:06:39.204
Keep reading.

975
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:44.084
I'm going out into the world
with an open heart now.

976
01:06:44.126 --> 01:06:47.003
and I'm going to go where life
takes me.

977
01:06:47.045 --> 01:06:49.256
So you wanna learn an
instrument?

978
01:06:49.297 --> 01:06:52.134
Yeah. we can't all play
every single one of them yet.

979
01:06:52.175 --> 01:06:53.009
Hey. I will have you know.

980
01:06:53.051 --> 01:06:55.137
I'm actually pretty bad at the harp.

981
01:06:55.178 --> 01:06:56.179
Oh okay.

982
01:06:56.221 --> 01:06:58.807
No. that's a lie. I'm
pretty good. I'm always-

983
01:06:58.849 --> 01:07:01.226
Well. I thought I'd start
with something easy like piano.

984
01:07:01.268 --> 01:07:03.562
Oh. well. if you want my advice.

985
01:07:03.603 --> 01:07:06.314
Yes. your advice is the
exact advice I would like.

986
01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:07.566
You should definitely go for
this one.

987
01:07:07.607 --> 01:07:09.067
It's 88 keys.

988
01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:11.153
It's weighted. it's perfect to
learn on.

989
01:07:11.194 --> 01:07:12.320
Great. I'll take it.

990
01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:13.572
Great.

991
01:07:13.613 --> 01:07:14.740
You're a good salesman.

992
01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:17.284
Do you ring me up here or up
there. or?

993
01:07:18.368 --> 01:07:20.412
Oh. no. no. no. I don't work here.

994
01:07:20.454 --> 01:07:21.288
Oh my God.

995
01:07:21.329 --> 01:07:23.248
Yeah. I came for a pedal

996
01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:25.083
and I've just been looking for
an excuse

997
01:07:25.125 --> 01:07:27.043
to keep talking to you. so.

998
01:07:30.088 --> 01:07:32.048
Jesse's dead.

999
01:07:32.090 --> 01:07:33.049
Yeah. yeah.

1000
01:07:33.091 --> 01:07:37.512
I heard. I'm so sorry.
I should have called.

1001
01:07:37.554 --> 01:07:39.222
Oh. no. no. it's okay.

1002
01:07:39.264 --> 01:07:41.266
When I started dating him.

1003
01:07:41.308 --> 01:07:44.394
I guess I stopped being a good
friend to you. so it's okay.

1004
01:07:44.436 --> 01:07:45.312
It's on me.

1005
01:07:46.396 --> 01:07:49.274
So what do you do then
when you're not pretending?

1006
01:07:49.316 --> 01:07:51.568
I teach Orchestra at AB.

1007
01:07:52.527 --> 01:07:54.404
Wow. that's crazy.

1008
01:07:54.446 --> 01:07:55.530
Yeah. I know. I know.

1009
01:07:55.572 --> 01:08:00.076
I'm back at Acton running the store.

1010
01:08:00.869 --> 01:08:01.703
Blair Books.

1011
01:08:01.745 --> 01:08:02.746
Yeah.

1012
01:08:02.788 --> 01:08:04.623
You used to hate it there.

1013
01:08:04.664 --> 01:08:05.791
People change. I guess.

1014
01:08:05.832 --> 01:08:07.167
Yeah. thank God for that.

1015
01:08:07.209 --> 01:08:09.211
Yeah. I agree. thank God.

1016
01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:11.880
Well. I'll have to drop by sometime.

1017
01:08:11.922 --> 01:08:13.507
Say hi.

1018
01:08:13.548 --> 01:08:15.550
I'd like that. that would be nice.

1019
01:08:16.426 --> 01:08:17.844
I'm happy to say I've reached a place

1020
01:08:17.886 --> 01:08:19.638
where your memory brings me joy.

1021
01:08:20.514 --> 01:08:23.558
I have found meaning in life
that I never would've guessed.

1022
01:08:27.395 --> 01:08:28.730
Wow.

1023
01:08:28.772 --> 01:08:29.564
See. the funny thing about this

1024
01:08:29.606 --> 01:08:32.692
is that you do actually work here.

1025
01:08:32.734 --> 01:08:34.486
Well. I'm so glad you stopped by

1026
01:08:34.528 --> 01:08:38.365
because I've actually become
quite good at the piano.

1027
01:08:38.406 --> 01:08:39.074
Really?

1028
01:08:39.115 --> 01:08:40.867
Yes. you'd be very impressed.

1029
01:08:40.909 --> 01:08:44.746
I know "Chopsticks" and "Heart
and Soul".

1030
01:08:44.788 --> 01:08:46.832
It's like the core of
western music right there.

1031
01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:50.544
Very good. Well. show me what
you got.

1032
01:08:50.585 --> 01:08:51.586
Well. I don't have a piano.

1033
01:08:51.628 --> 01:08:54.422
Sure you do. Anything
you can play on the piano

1034
01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:56.341
you can play on the counter.

1035
01:08:56.383 --> 01:08:57.467
It's an old music
teacher's trick.

1036
01:08:57.509 --> 01:08:59.678
Here. gimme a song.

1037
01:08:59.719 --> 01:09:02.556
Beethoven.

1038
01:09:02.597 --> 01:09:05.934
Okay. that's less of a
song and more of a person.

1039
01:09:05.976 --> 01:09:07.853
But I think we can work with that.

1040
01:09:07.894 --> 01:09:09.771
Ready?

1041
01:09:09.813 --> 01:09:11.815
Yeah.

1042
01:09:16.361 --> 01:09:17.362
Oh. I know this one.

1043
01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:21.741
You wanna take this one?

1044
01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:23.451
There you go.

1045
01:09:43.305 --> 01:09:44.931
What is your sister doing?

1046
01:09:44.973 --> 01:09:46.641
That's more.

1047
01:09:46.683 --> 01:09:47.976
Living.

1048
01:09:48.018 --> 01:09:50.979
Oh. so that's what that looks like.

1049
01:09:51.021 --> 01:09:51.855
There. it's good.

1050
01:09:56.693 --> 01:09:59.321
So I should probably buy a book

1051
01:09:59.362 --> 01:10:01.656
so it doesn't seem like I came
in here

1052
01:10:01.698 --> 01:10:02.407
just to talk to you.

1053
01:10:04.242 --> 01:10:04.910
This one.

1054
01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:08.830
On the house.

1055
01:10:08.872 --> 01:10:09.706
Yeah?

1056
01:10:09.748 --> 01:10:12.500
Yeah. or you can just. you can
owe me.

1057
01:10:12.542 --> 01:10:15.545
Or how about I take
you to lunch sometime?

1058
01:10:16.504 --> 01:10:17.672
Lunch?

1059
01:10:17.714 --> 01:10:19.341
Yeah. yeah.

1060
01:10:19.382 --> 01:10:22.385
I was thinking sometime
between breakfast and dinner.

1061
01:10:23.929 --> 01:10:25.221
Lunch sounds nice.

1062
01:10:25.889 --> 01:10:27.307
Great.

1063
01:10:27.349 --> 01:10:28.224
Okay.

1064
01:10:38.026 --> 01:10:39.611
Tell me everything.

1065
01:10:39.653 --> 01:10:43.323
I think if I work hard.
I can have the sort of life

1066
01:10:43.365 --> 01:10:45.033
that you would've wanted for me.

1067
01:10:45.075 --> 01:10:46.576
I can't go on a date. right?

1068
01:10:46.618 --> 01:10:48.954
Like. that's crazy.

1069
01:10:48.995 --> 01:10:52.832
I can call him next year
maybe if he's still single.

1070
01:10:52.874 --> 01:10:54.751
Well. shutting yourself
off from the world

1071
01:10:54.793 --> 01:10:57.712
doesn't prove how much
you loved your husband.

1072
01:10:57.754 --> 01:11:00.590
You have your whole life ahead
of you. You should live it.

1073
01:11:06.054 --> 01:11:09.307
I believe I can have a happy future

1074
01:11:09.349 --> 01:11:12.268
where I love and am loved in return.

1075
01:11:28.076 --> 01:11:30.578
So we've been dating six months now.

1076
01:11:32.956 --> 01:11:33.790
Yeah.

1077
01:11:35.709 --> 01:11:39.379
One of the months was
February. so it's light six.

1078
01:11:41.715 --> 01:11:42.590
Come on.

1079
01:11:43.591 --> 01:11:45.969
Well. long or short.

1080
01:11:49.848 --> 01:11:51.391
I think I'm in love with you.

1081
01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:59.441
but I don't think I'm ready to
say it.

1082
01:11:59.482 --> 01:12:00.525
Or hear myself say it.

1083
01:12:07.615 --> 01:12:08.491
Well.

1084
01:12:11.453 --> 01:12:13.663
Don't tell anyone I told you.

1085
01:12:15.498 --> 01:12:16.708
but I think I'm in love with you too.

1086
01:12:19.878 --> 01:12:21.504
I always have been.

1087
01:12:48.031 --> 01:12:48.990
I don't know. it all kind
of sounds the same to me.

1088
01:12:49.032 --> 01:12:51.409
I'm not gonna lie. but
I know that you love it.

1089
01:12:51.451 --> 01:12:52.118
So I appreciate it.

1090
01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:53.078
Thank you.

1091
01:12:53.119 --> 01:12:55.580
Hey. you wanna go this way?

1092
01:12:56.539 --> 01:12:57.957
Let's go for a walk.

1093
01:12:57.999 --> 01:13:00.794
I'm sorry. we're gonna go down
some steps.

1094
01:13:00.835 --> 01:13:01.669
What?

1095
01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:02.754
Yep.

1096
01:13:02.796 --> 01:13:03.421
And you're gonna keep your eyes closed

1097
01:13:03.463 --> 01:13:04.672
because you trust me. right?

1098
01:13:04.714 --> 01:13:06.007
I do. I trust you.

1099
01:13:06.049 --> 01:13:06.841
Okay. one foot. here we go.

1100
01:13:06.883 --> 01:13:08.635
That's perfect. you're doing great.

1101
01:13:08.676 --> 01:13:11.930
I'm sorry. are we going
onto the green line?

1102
01:13:11.971 --> 01:13:13.807
We are not going onto the
green line.

1103
01:13:13.848 --> 01:13:15.767
It kind of feels like you're
taking me onto the green line.

1104
01:13:15.809 --> 01:13:16.643
It's not true.

1105
01:13:16.684 --> 01:13:17.685
Oh. Jesus.

1106
01:13:17.727 --> 01:13:20.146
The lighting here is much
better. I promise you.

1107
01:13:20.188 --> 01:13:22.524
Okay. so here's the thing.

1108
01:13:22.565 --> 01:13:23.858
Yep.

1109
01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:25.193
All right.

1110
01:13:25.235 --> 01:13:26.027
Where am I going?

1111
01:13:26.069 --> 01:13:28.696
You're here. I got you.

1112
01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:30.740
So here's the thing.

1113
01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:34.619
I bought something a few weeks ago.

1114
01:13:35.578 --> 01:13:39.082
and I haven't been able to
decide when to give it to you.

1115
01:13:40.917 --> 01:13:42.877
I was doing some thinking and I realized

1116
01:13:42.919 --> 01:13:46.464
that it should probably
be you that decides.

1117
01:13:48.091 --> 01:13:49.092
Okay.

1118
01:13:59.727 --> 01:14:00.603
Oh my gosh.

1119
01:14:02.105 --> 01:14:03.898
Your students.

1120
01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:06.734
We have been working on
this for a few months now.

1121
01:14:07.819 --> 01:14:10.822
I'd call it your song. on
account of it being yours.

1122
01:14:10.864 --> 01:14:13.116
but Elton John kind of
beat me to the punch.

1123
01:14:13.158 --> 01:14:17.036
So it's currently untitled.

1124
01:14:17.078 --> 01:14:19.581
Guys. actually. can we cut the
music?

1125
01:14:19.622 --> 01:14:21.749
Sorry. the sound is
really traveling in here.

1126
01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:23.459
Sorry Mr. Lee.

1127
01:14:23.501 --> 01:14:24.460
No. it's fine.

1128
01:14:25.628 --> 01:14:26.504
Hey.

1129
01:14:26.963 --> 01:14:27.797
Hi.

1130
01:14:29.632 --> 01:14:36.598
Emma. I was put on this earth
to be yours. and I am so.

1131
01:14:36.639 --> 01:14:38.808
so lucky to be able to call you mine.

1132
01:14:40.852 --> 01:14:44.606
I believe in us. I believe
we're good for each other.

1133
01:14:44.647 --> 01:14:48.026
And I believe that I'm a
better man because of you.

1134
01:14:52.864 --> 01:14:53.740
Here it is.

1135
01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:56.659
And I don't want you to do anything

1136
01:14:56.701 --> 01:15:01.706
except hold on to it
and just keep it safe.

1137
01:15:03.291 --> 01:15:08.504
And when you're ready. if you're
ever ready. I'll be ready.

1138
01:15:24.562 --> 01:15:25.563
I love it.

1139
01:15:27.023 --> 01:15:28.191
And I love you.

1140
01:15:31.277 --> 01:15:32.153
Thank you.

1141
01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:39.160
I love you so much.

1142
01:16:43.891 --> 01:16:46.102
So I'm going to say yes to Sam Lee.

1143
01:16:47.687 --> 01:16:49.647
I think that you would like him
for me.

1144
01:16:50.648 --> 01:16:52.984
He's kind. he makes me laugh.

1145
01:16:53.026 --> 01:16:55.737
And he makes room for you.

1146
01:16:55.778 --> 01:16:57.238
He accepts the full me.

1147
01:16:58.448 --> 01:17:00.616
and he knows the full me
includes you.

1148
01:17:05.663 --> 01:17:06.998
Sam.

1149
01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:07.874
What are you doing?

1150
01:17:07.915 --> 01:17:09.250
I'm proposing to you.

1151
01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:11.085
I'm in my underwear.

1152
01:17:11.127 --> 01:17:12.003
I don't care.

1153
01:17:12.837 --> 01:17:17.633
Sam Lee. you are my second chance.

1154
01:17:17.675 --> 01:17:20.678
You are the arms that helped
me pull myself back up.

1155
01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:22.930
You're the life that I never saw coming.

1156
01:17:22.972 --> 01:17:24.265
You are my reminder that life

1157
01:17:24.307 --> 01:17:25.850
can be unexpectedly beautiful.

1158
01:17:25.892 --> 01:17:27.810
and I promise I will spend
the rest of our lives

1159
01:17:27.852 --> 01:17:29.645
trying to be that reminder for you.

1160
01:17:31.439 --> 01:17:32.774
Will you marry me?

1161
01:17:32.815 --> 01:17:33.191
Yes.

1162
01:17:33.816 --> 01:17:35.109
Yes. will you marry me?

1163
01:17:35.151 --> 01:17:38.154
Yes. yes. yes.

1164
01:17:38.988 --> 01:17:43.993
I wanna be happy and I want
more love in my life. Jesse.

1165
01:17:44.243 --> 01:17:47.789
So I'm asking for your
blessing to embrace it.

1166
01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:49.248
Your love. Emma.

1167
01:17:58.174 --> 01:18:00.343
You know what I thought
on our wedding day.

1168
01:18:01.969 --> 01:18:05.848
What.

1169
01:18:05.890 --> 01:18:09.977
I was putting on my tux.
I was a little nervous.

1170
01:18:10.937 --> 01:18:15.358
I just thought. at least
I picked the right person.

1171
01:18:17.318 --> 01:18:19.695
I always thought. no
matter how hard it got.

1172
01:18:21.197 --> 01:18:25.201
at least we picked the right person.

1173
01:18:30.373 --> 01:18:34.293
You gotta keep being the right person.

1174
01:18:38.548 --> 01:18:41.426
You have to change together

1175
01:18:41.467 --> 01:18:43.386
so that you can stay the right person.

1176
01:18:45.096 --> 01:18:46.180
I wanna be with you.

1177
01:18:48.182 --> 01:18:50.143
So if staying in Acton for a bit
is important

1178
01:18:50.184 --> 01:18:51.144
then I will do it.

1179
01:18:51.185 --> 01:18:52.061
A bit?

1180
01:18:52.103 --> 01:18:52.895
As long as you need.

1181
01:18:52.937 --> 01:18:55.106
Jesse. I wanna stay here always.

1182
01:18:56.065 --> 01:18:57.733
I want to continue our life here.

1183
01:18:58.818 --> 01:19:00.153
Because of the store?

1184
01:19:00.194 --> 01:19:01.404
No. Jesse. it's not just
because of the store...

1185
01:19:01.446 --> 01:19:02.905
How about this?

1186
01:19:02.947 --> 01:19:05.032
We go on a big famous
bookstore tour of Europe

1187
01:19:05.074 --> 01:19:06.868
and we can see all the
world's greatest libraies.

1188
01:19:06.909 --> 01:19:09.162
Jesse. I wanna stay here.
I wanna be with my family.

1189
01:19:12.915 --> 01:19:17.128
You're asking me now that I am free.

1190
01:19:19.005 --> 01:19:20.339
now that I can go anywhere

1191
01:19:22.133 --> 01:19:24.969
to chain myself to a
life that I can't live.

1192
01:19:30.850 --> 01:19:32.310
My world is here. Jesse.

1193
01:19:33.895 --> 01:19:35.855
I have people I love.

1194
01:19:35.897 --> 01:19:39.400
I feel like I belong. like
I'm a part of something.

1195
01:19:39.442 --> 01:19:43.237
And I have found a peace with
myself here

1196
01:19:43.279 --> 01:19:46.949
that I never expected. This life

1197
01:19:46.991 --> 01:19:49.535
that my parents pushed on me. I
left it.

1198
01:19:49.577 --> 01:19:51.412
And then I lived my own life.

1199
01:19:51.454 --> 01:19:52.497
And then life brought me back to them.

1200
01:19:53.873 --> 01:19:54.540
And now.

1201
01:19:57.210 --> 01:20:00.296
I've chosen all of this.

1202
01:20:01.881 --> 01:20:04.008
I've chosen it for myself.

1203
01:20:05.468 --> 01:20:06.552
This is who I am now.

1204
01:20:08.846 --> 01:20:10.973
You're different.

1205
01:20:11.015 --> 01:20:12.016
Not in a bad way.

1206
01:20:15.853 --> 01:20:19.148
You just changed.

1207
01:20:23.277 --> 01:20:24.278
See. the Emma I knew.

1208
01:20:25.863 --> 01:20:29.575
she wanted to be as far
away as humanly possible

1209
01:20:29.617 --> 01:20:31.327
from Blair Books.

1210
01:20:31.369 --> 01:20:34.622
And she was never gonna sit still

1211
01:20:34.664 --> 01:20:37.833
until she had seen the entire world.

1212
01:20:39.418 --> 01:20:43.089
She loved me and only me.

1213
01:20:48.177 --> 01:20:49.845
That's not you anymore.

1214
01:20:52.473 --> 01:20:53.849
No. it's not.

1215
01:20:56.936 --> 01:20:59.146
I promise we can
live any life you want.

1216
01:20:59.188 --> 01:21:00.398
Just not Acton.

1217
01:21:03.317 --> 01:21:07.113
You're asking me to be
someone that I'm not anymore.

1218
01:21:07.154 --> 01:21:08.114
You're asking me to be someone

1219
01:21:08.155 --> 01:21:10.116
I always told you I wouldn't be.

1220
01:21:30.970 --> 01:21:32.430
We didn't stay the right person.

1221
01:21:44.233 --> 01:21:48.321
I could try and be the
right person for you.

1222
01:21:48.362 --> 01:21:51.324
You can try and make yourself
the right person for me. but...

1223
01:21:54.952 --> 01:21:56.078
That's not real love.

1224
01:21:59.707 --> 01:22:01.083
We should head back.

1225
01:22:09.675 --> 01:22:12.136
You wanna stay here
just a little bit longer?

1226
01:22:16.307 --> 01:22:17.183
Okay.

1227
01:22:46.379 --> 01:22:48.422
You know. there was a game
I used to play out there

1228
01:22:52.468 --> 01:22:55.721
and I'd just asked myself.
what's Emma doing right now?

1229
01:22:55.763 --> 01:22:57.264
And I'd say something like.

1230
01:22:57.306 --> 01:23:00.184
I bet she's eating tapas in Barcelona

1231
01:23:00.226 --> 01:23:05.064
or she's on the beach
in Malibu. In Berlin.

1232
01:23:06.691 --> 01:23:07.566
I was always wrong.

1233
01:23:10.319 --> 01:23:14.156
You were here and I never
guessed here.

1234
01:23:20.162 --> 01:23:21.706
I'm starting to see it.

1235
01:23:22.623 --> 01:23:23.499
This is you.

1236
01:23:26.335 --> 01:23:28.129
I never stopped loving you.

1237
01:23:31.215 --> 01:23:32.174
Do you believe me?

1238
01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:35.761
I'm really try to.

1239
01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:40.641
One day you might.

1240
01:23:41.726 --> 01:23:42.601
I hope so.

1241
01:23:45.646 --> 01:23:47.314
Come on. let's go.

1242
01:23:47.356 --> 01:23:52.361
♪ Now our wild song are oldies ♪

1243
01:23:55.197 --> 01:24:00.202

weren't meant to be. huh?

1249
01:24:32.151 --> 01:24:34.528
I don't think things
have to last to be real.

1250
01:24:35.905 --> 01:24:37.823
We can be meant to have been.

1251
01:24:39.825 --> 01:24:41.076
Meant to have been.

1252
01:24:42.745 --> 01:24:43.621
Yeah.

1253
01:24:57.134 --> 01:24:57.802
Thank you.

1254
01:24:59.261 --> 01:25:00.137
For what?

1255
01:25:00.971 --> 01:25:02.223
The thought of seeing you again.

1256
01:25:04.642 --> 01:25:05.810
You saved my life.

1257
01:26:12.209 --> 01:26:13.836
I know that for her.

1258
01:26:13.878 --> 01:26:16.255
it's sometimes been him
and sometimes been me.

1259
01:26:17.464 --> 01:26:19.300
For me. it's always been her.

1260
01:26:21.468 --> 01:26:22.970
All right. that's the end of the day.

1261
01:26:23.012 --> 01:26:26.473
I'm out of things to
say. It is what it is.

1262
01:26:27.975 --> 01:26:29.935
It's outta my hands now.

1263
01:26:29.977 --> 01:26:31.437
It's Emma's choice to make.

1264
01:26:33.355 --> 01:26:34.690
Mr. Lee.

1265
01:26:34.732 --> 01:26:37.651
Isn't that exactly what
you did in high school?

1266
01:26:37.693 --> 01:26:38.611
What are you talking about?

1267
01:26:38.652 --> 01:26:39.862
She's right.

1268
01:26:39.904 --> 01:26:42.948
You never just told Emma how you felt.

1269
01:26:42.990 --> 01:26:45.326
You hinted at it. but you never
said it.

1270
01:26:45.367 --> 01:26:48.329
Yeah. this Jesse guy.
he never makes it unclear.

1271
01:26:48.370 --> 01:26:49.830
He wants her and he
always let her know that.

1272
01:26:49.872 --> 01:26:51.540
He puts it all out on the line.

1273
01:26:51.916 --> 01:26:53.542
Yeah. if you're gonna go
down. Sam. go down swinging.

1274
01:26:54.919 --> 01:26:55.961
Go tell this woman how

1275
01:26:56.003 --> 01:26:56.670
heartbroken you'll be

1276
01:26:56.712 --> 01:26:57.463
without her.

1277
01:26:57.504 --> 01:26:59.256
Yeah.

1278
01:26:59.298 --> 01:27:02.217
Remind her of the life you
two could have had together.

1279
01:27:03.719 --> 01:27:04.887
I can't lose her.

1280
01:27:04.929 --> 01:27:06.889
Then do something about it.

1281
01:27:06.931 --> 01:27:08.515
Yeah.

1282
01:27:11.977 --> 01:27:14.355
I gotta go. I gotta go.

1283
01:27:30.913 --> 01:27:31.872
Thank you.

1284
01:27:37.586 --> 01:27:38.587
Sam!

1285
01:27:40.589 --> 01:27:41.590
Sam?

1286
01:27:44.093 --> 01:27:45.678
Damn it.

1287
01:27:46.929 --> 01:27:47.930
Pick up your phone. man.

1288
01:27:52.601 --> 01:27:55.479
Oh. hey Marie. I. uh- Hello.

1289
01:27:56.397 --> 01:27:57.481
I'm looking for Emma.

1290
01:27:57.523 --> 01:27:59.858
Hey. hey.

1291
01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:01.568
She's not here.

1292
01:28:01.610 --> 01:28:02.820
Any idea where she went?

1293
01:28:02.861 --> 01:28:05.406
Um. She. um...

1294
01:28:05.447 --> 01:28:06.824
Just tell me.

1295
01:28:06.865 --> 01:28:08.075
I don't wanna tell you.

1296
01:28:08.117 --> 01:28:08.951
Marie.

1297
01:28:09.952 --> 01:28:12.913
She... You know. um. she...

1298
01:28:12.955 --> 01:28:15.290
She's with Jesse. right?

1299
01:28:15.624 --> 01:28:18.085
Look. I know. okay.

1300
01:28:18.127 --> 01:28:20.004
I know.

1301
01:28:20.045 --> 01:28:21.588
And it's fine.

1302
01:28:21.630 --> 01:28:23.799
Just. just tell me where they went.

1303
01:28:24.633 --> 01:28:25.509
I can take it.

1304
01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:28.470
They went to the cabin in Maine.

1305
01:28:37.688 --> 01:28:40.774
Shit. Mother. Shit.

1306
01:28:43.736 --> 01:28:44.611
As friends?

1307
01:28:46.447 --> 01:28:48.407
As friends. right. right?

1308
01:28:48.449 --> 01:28:50.951
It's a simple question.
As friends?

1309
01:28:50.993 --> 01:28:53.037
Did they go as friends? Were
they friends?

1310
01:28:53.078 --> 01:28:54.997
Were they friendly? Were
they platonically friends?

1311
01:28:55.039 --> 01:28:56.957
I don't know how to answer that.

1312
01:29:06.383 --> 01:29:07.843
Sam.

1313
01:29:07.885 --> 01:29:08.761
You're back.

1314
01:29:08.802 --> 01:29:09.636
Is Sam here?

1315
01:29:09.678 --> 01:29:11.472
Yeah. he was just here.

1316
01:29:11.513 --> 01:29:12.473
He was looking for you.

1317
01:29:12.514 --> 01:29:13.599
He was looking for me.

1318
01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:15.976
Well. how did he seem.
hopeful. angry. devastated?

1319
01:29:16.018 --> 01:29:18.020
At first he was hopeful.

1320
01:29:18.062 --> 01:29:18.896
Oh. that's great.

1321
01:29:18.937 --> 01:29:20.606
And then I told him you went
to Maine

1322
01:29:20.647 --> 01:29:23.442
with Jesse and he got sort of devastated.

1323
01:29:23.484 --> 01:29:28.405
Oh my God. Marie. I've ruined it.

1324
01:29:28.447 --> 01:29:29.448
No.

1325
01:29:29.490 --> 01:29:31.575
I've completely ruined
it by loving them both.

1326
01:29:31.617 --> 01:29:32.868
Also. though. um...

1327
01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:34.536
I've lost them both.

1328
01:29:34.578 --> 01:29:36.371
Don't you think maybe you
should be

1329
01:29:36.413 --> 01:29:37.664
like a little more mad at me?

1330
01:29:37.706 --> 01:29:39.374
No. I'm not mad at you

1331
01:29:39.416 --> 01:29:42.419
because you were there for
me through all of this.

1332
01:29:42.461 --> 01:29:43.879
No. I'm not mad.

1333
01:29:43.921 --> 01:29:45.130
You're not even a little mad

1334
01:29:45.172 --> 01:29:46.840
for that day on the dock when
I convinced you your husband

1335
01:29:46.882 --> 01:29:48.467
was dead and it turned out I was
wrong?

1336
01:29:48.509 --> 01:29:51.011
No. Marie. I was insane
that day on the dock.

1337
01:29:51.053 --> 01:29:53.013
If I had spent the last four years

1338
01:29:53.055 --> 01:29:55.641
believing that he was alive.
I would've lost my mind.

1339
01:29:55.682 --> 01:29:57.684
No. I did the best I
could with the information

1340
01:29:57.726 --> 01:30:00.562
that I had and that led me to Sam.

1341
01:30:01.730 --> 01:30:03.774
I can't lose him Marie.

1342
01:30:03.816 --> 01:30:07.986
So don't. go tell him
what you just told me.

1343
01:30:08.028 --> 01:30:09.696
You're right.

1344
01:30:09.738 --> 01:30:10.739
This isn't over yet.

1345
01:30:14.118 --> 01:30:14.993
Let's go.

1346
01:30:16.453 --> 01:30:17.788
Come on. come on.

1347
01:30:22.918 --> 01:30:24.086
Pick up. pick up.

1348
01:30:28.757 --> 01:30:29.591
Hello.

1349
01:30:29.633 --> 01:30:30.300
Sam. can you hear me?

1350
01:30:30.342 --> 01:30:31.593
Emma. yeah. I can hear you.

1351
01:30:31.635 --> 01:30:32.886
Can you hear me?

1352
01:30:32.928 --> 01:30:36.181
Sam. I need you back.

1353
01:30:36.223 --> 01:30:37.015
Hello?

1354
01:30:37.057 --> 01:30:39.685
Jesse was gone and I was broken.

1355
01:30:39.726 --> 01:30:40.894
Emma. you're breaking up.
Hello?

1356
01:30:40.936 --> 01:30:45.858
But then I put myself back together

1357
01:30:45.899 --> 01:30:47.901
and the person that I became
chose you.

1358
01:30:54.783 --> 01:30:56.910
Sam! Sam.

1359
01:30:56.952 --> 01:30:59.121
Sam. don't hang up.

1360
01:30:59.163 --> 01:30:59.955
I just hit someone.

1361
01:30:59.997 --> 01:31:03.208
Ah. honey. you hit me.

1362
01:31:03.250 --> 01:31:04.960
Shit. are you okay?

1363
01:31:05.878 --> 01:31:08.046
No. no. I'm not.

1364
01:31:08.922 --> 01:31:09.882
I haven't slept in days.

1365
01:31:09.923 --> 01:31:12.718
There's reporters camped
outside of our house.

1366
01:31:12.759 --> 01:31:15.762
I've lost all semblance of
privacy with my students.

1367
01:31:15.804 --> 01:31:16.680
I'm terrible.

1368
01:31:16.722 --> 01:31:17.389
Sam.

1369
01:31:17.431 --> 01:31:18.765
No. no. I need to say something.

1370
01:31:18.807 --> 01:31:22.936
I need to. I've loved every
version of you

1371
01:31:22.978 --> 01:31:26.231
and I will love every version
of you that you become.

1372
01:31:27.733 --> 01:31:32.237
I am madly in love with
you Em. and I'm in.

1373
01:31:32.279 --> 01:31:35.824
I swear to God with every
fiber of my being. I am in.

1374
01:31:36.700 --> 01:31:39.786
But I refuse to settle for part
of you.

1375
01:31:41.163 --> 01:31:42.539
I need you to be in too.

1376
01:31:44.166 --> 01:31:45.959
I'm in. I'm in.

1377
01:31:46.001 --> 01:31:48.962
I'm so sorry it took you so
long to understand that.

1378
01:31:49.004 --> 01:31:51.590
Jesse was right for me once.
but you are right for me now.

1379
01:31:51.632 --> 01:31:54.718
And I promise I will work
for the rest of my days

1380
01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:56.136
to be the right person to you.

1381
01:31:56.178 --> 01:31:57.638
You be whoever you want.

1382
01:31:58.889 --> 01:32:01.642
If you're in. I'm in. nothing
you do could ever change that.

1383
01:32:04.144 --> 01:32:05.562
I went to Maine with Jesse.

1384
01:32:05.604 --> 01:32:08.815
I already said that I was in. okay.

1385
01:32:08.857 --> 01:32:10.901
Just save the rest for couples therapy.

1386
01:32:10.943 --> 01:32:11.944
Okay.

1387
01:32:15.197 --> 01:32:17.950
Our life starts now. together.

1388
01:32:19.701 --> 01:32:21.828
You're a good man.

1389
01:32:21.870 --> 01:32:23.622
I'm all right.

1390
01:32:30.003 --> 01:32:31.171
Oh. oh. oh.

1391
01:32:31.213 --> 01:32:32.839
Oh my God. are you okay?

1392
01:32:32.881 --> 01:32:34.841
Sit down for a bit.

1393
01:32:34.883 --> 01:32:36.009
It's a little spinny.

1394
01:32:39.221 --> 01:32:42.015
Excuse me. can somebody
call an ambulance?

1395
01:32:42.057 --> 01:32:42.933
Yeah. thank you.

1396
01:32:44.017 --> 01:32:46.561
Hey. shut up. just go around.

1397
01:32:48.313 --> 01:32:49.731
We're fine. thank you.

1398
01:32:51.608 --> 01:32:52.609
I love you.

1399
01:32:52.651 --> 01:32:53.777
Oh. I love you too.

1400
01:32:53.819 --> 01:32:55.195
Ah. sorry.

1401
01:32:55.237 --> 01:32:57.030
No. no. no. it's fine.

1402
01:32:57.072 --> 01:32:58.782

Emma. I met

1408
01:33:36.862 --> 01:33:39.323
Somehow she's convinced me
to get back in the water.

1409
01:33:40.782 --> 01:33:41.992
But it feels freeing now.

1410
