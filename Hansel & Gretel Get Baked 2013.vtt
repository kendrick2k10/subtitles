2
00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:34.790
Take them into the forest now.

3
00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.979
You stay here.

4
00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:05.023
I'll be back soon.

5
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.086
- Wait!
- No!

6
00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:10.055
I said. stay here!

7
00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:18.432
Father! Wait!

8
00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:22.190
Help us! Please!

9
00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:23.291
Hello! Is anybody there?

10
00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:47.209
Eat!

11
00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:51.657
Eat!

12
00:05:01.067 --> 00:05:02.091
Eat!

13
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.335
{Screaming}
Eat!

14
00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:12.810
This oven's not hot enough!

15
00:05:12.912 --> 00:05:13.901
More wood!

16
00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:44.069
What?

17
00:06:08.768 --> 00:06:10.133
Is it hot enough for you now?

18
00:06:11.237 --> 00:06:14.297
<i>My sister and I
never saw our parents again.</i>

19
00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:17.233
<i>It was just the two of us.</i>

20
00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.808
<i>But we learned a couple of things
while trapped in that house.</i>

21
00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:25.144
<i>One: Never walk into a house
made of candy.</i>

22
00:06:27.653 --> 00:06:31.350
<i>And two: If you're going to kill a witch.</i>

23
00:06:31.457 --> 00:06:32.719
<i>set her ass on fire.</i>

24
00:09:00.973 --> 00:09:03.066
Fresh milk! Fresh milk

25
00:09:03.175 --> 00:09:07.373
for the children!
Keep your children healthy! Fresh milk!

26
00:09:08.781 --> 00:09:11.614
After weeks of living in fear.

27
00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:16.677
we have finally caught the one
responsible for all this terror!

28
00:09:16.789 --> 00:09:17.056
For crimes against
the city and people of Augsburg.

29
00:09:17.056 --> 00:09:21.425
For crimes against
the city and people of Augsburg.

30
00:09:22.361 --> 00:09:27.856
and for consorting with
the spawn of Satan.

31
00:09:29.268 --> 00:09:33.728
I hereby accuse this woman

32
00:09:35.074 --> 00:09:38.510
of the craft of witchery!

33
00:09:38.644 --> 00:09:41.340
Burn her! Burn her!

34
00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:44.546
Behold

35
00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:47.514
the eyes of the demon.

36
00:09:50.156 --> 00:09:51.316
Go to hell.

37
00:09:59.565 --> 00:10:01.032
Order!

38
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.489
Order!

39
00:10:06.772 --> 00:10:07.761
Berringer.

40
00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:10.538
this is still my town.

41
00:10:13.245 --> 00:10:14.678
Listen to me.

42
00:10:15.514 --> 00:10:18.540
As your mayor. I know only too well

43
00:10:18.651 --> 00:10:23.088
that many of you
have lost precious loved ones to this

44
00:10:23.222 --> 00:10:27.056
witch plague.
but we can't just burn this woman.

45
00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:29.184
We first need evidence.

46
00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:30.455
We can't just have...

47
00:10:30.563 --> 00:10:33.760
You know a witch when you see one!

48
00:10:33.866 --> 00:10:37.927
They ride at night
and they make pacts with the devil!

49
00:10:39.005 --> 00:10:42.532
This woman will burn!

50
00:10:42.675 --> 00:10:45.075
Burn her! Burn her!

51
00:10:52.551 --> 00:10:56.078
Let the girl go
or I'm going to blow your sheriff's brains

52
00:10:56.188 --> 00:10:58.281
all over these fucking hillbillies.

53
00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:02.188
Move. Go on.

54
00:11:02.294 --> 00:11:04.728
Let her go. Go over there.

55
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:05.819
Check her.

56
00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.094
What's your name?

57
00:11:10.302 --> 00:11:11.599
What's your name?

58
00:11:12.371 --> 00:11:14.396
- Mina.
- Don't worry.

59
00:11:14.807 --> 00:11:18.470
When a woman truly deals in witchcraft.
she cannot hide it.

60
00:11:18.577 --> 00:11:23.378
A nasty rot sets in. It shows in her teeth.

61
00:11:23.482 --> 00:11:25.143
in her skin and her eyes.

62
00:11:25.251 --> 00:11:28.345
This is not a witch. This woman's clean.

63
00:11:29.822 --> 00:11:34.452
I'm sure your sheriff was only trying
to protect you good people.

64
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.858
But your mayor has done
a very smart thing.

65
00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.955
He hired us.

66
00:11:40.066 --> 00:11:42.091
My name is Gretel.

67
00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:44.362
and this is my brother. Hansel.

68
00:11:45.604 --> 00:11:47.799
We know that many of your children
have gone missing.

69
00:11:47.907 --> 00:11:51.274
But killing an innocent woman
will not bring them back.

70
00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:53.436
Go home! We don't want you here!

71
00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:55.013
We don't want more evil in Augsburg!

72
00:11:55.114 --> 00:11:58.242
Well. evil is upon you.
whether you like it or not.

73
00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:01.376
Now if your children are still alive.

74
00:12:02.521 --> 00:12:06.013
we will find them.
But if anyone harms this woman.

75
00:12:07.526 --> 00:12:09.289
you're going to have me to deal with.

76
00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:11.260
Now go home!

77
00:12:11.363 --> 00:12:13.194
Go!

78
00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:24.771
I guess you're free to go.

79
00:12:26.345 --> 00:12:27.471
Thank you.

80
00:12:29.548 --> 00:12:30.708
Hansel.

81
00:12:32.084 --> 00:12:33.210
You're welcome.

82
00:12:35.121 --> 00:12:37.919
What the hell do you think
you're doing? Huh?

83
00:12:38.023 --> 00:12:41.618
That woman is a suspect in my custody.
You can't just come here...

84
00:12:41.727 --> 00:12:45.060
Any man with half a brain
could see that she was not a witch.

85
00:12:45.498 --> 00:12:46.760
Now listen. Sheriff.

86
00:12:46.866 --> 00:12:48.629
Hansel and Gretel
have been brought here...

87
00:12:48.734 --> 00:12:50.725
You better listen!

88
00:12:51.904 --> 00:12:55.271
I'm not going to have this bitch
and her scoundrel of a brother

89
00:12:55.975 --> 00:12:57.272
coming into my town.

90
00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:01.204
telling me what to do.

91
00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.717
Don't!

92
00:13:10.356 --> 00:13:11.823
Just don't.

93
00:13:16.929 --> 00:13:19.591
Come on. Let's get you started.

94
00:13:22.434 --> 00:13:25.961
<i>There's been reports of
a strange cottage in the north forest.</i>

95
00:13:26.739 --> 00:13:29.003
<i>Locals won't go near the place.</i>

96
00:13:30.309 --> 00:13:32.903
<i>A good place to start the investigation.</i>

97
00:13:47.927 --> 00:13:49.417
Move!

98
00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:24.412
Gretel!

99
00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:47.640
She looks angry.

100
00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:50.244
Yeah.

101
00:15:50.349 --> 00:15:52.977
A face like that. I'd be angry. too.

102
00:15:55.921 --> 00:15:57.479
Would you shut up?

103
00:15:58.257 --> 00:16:00.555
<i>That witch we found
was a dead end. Mayor.</i>

104
00:16:00.659 --> 00:16:02.286
<i>No trace of any kids. I'm sorry.</i>

105
00:16:02.394 --> 00:16:04.191
But we found this.

106
00:16:06.999 --> 00:16:09.194
That is called the Blood Moon. Mayor.

107
00:16:10.002 --> 00:16:11.469
An eclipse of the moon.

108
00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:14.630
It happens once in a generation
and is a night most holy to witches.

109
00:16:15.441 --> 00:16:16.703
Oh. my God.

110
00:16:17.443 --> 00:16:18.432
When?

111
00:16:18.544 --> 00:16:21.445
According to this.
three nights from now.

112
00:16:21.547 --> 00:16:23.981
There's no doubt in my mind
that all this is connected.

113
00:16:24.083 --> 00:16:26.051
Children being taken in these numbers

114
00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:28.142
from the roads and fields
so close to town.

115
00:16:28.253 --> 00:16:31.950
A witch does not come out
in the open like that.

116
00:16:32.057 --> 00:16:33.524
Not unless she has to.

117
00:16:36.128 --> 00:16:38.961
Witch activity
has been increasing lately.

118
00:16:39.064 --> 00:16:42.033
More sightings.
animal slaughter. Sabbaths.

119
00:16:42.968 --> 00:16:44.629
It seems the coming of the Blood Moon

120
00:16:44.737 --> 00:16:47.934
is dragging every damned witch
from their dark hiding place.

121
00:16:49.742 --> 00:16:50.936
So.

122
00:16:51.977 --> 00:16:53.069
it seems like a good thing

123
00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:55.078
that you brought us here.
doesn't it. Mayor?

124
00:16:56.382 --> 00:16:57.610
Half your money now.

125
00:16:57.716 --> 00:17:01.812
The rest when the children
are brought back alive.

126
00:17:03.355 --> 00:17:05.050
Oh. there he is. right on time.

127
00:17:05.157 --> 00:17:07.990
This is Jackson.
He knows these woods inside and out.

128
00:17:08.093 --> 00:17:10.493
And he'll take you to where
the last sightings were.

129
00:17:10.596 --> 00:17:13.064
Yeah. We can be there in a few hours.

130
00:17:13.165 --> 00:17:13.399
Not at night. It's too dangerous.

131
00:17:13.399 --> 00:17:15.833
Not at night. It's too dangerous.

132
00:17:15.934 --> 00:17:17.094
We'll leave in the morning.

133
00:17:17.202 --> 00:17:19.136
Yeah. she's right.
It's much too dangerous.

134
00:17:20.105 --> 00:17:23.632
So. any place
we can get a drink in this hellhole?

135
00:17:30.149 --> 00:17:31.207
Shut up!

136
00:17:31.316 --> 00:17:34.376
The last one they took was a boy.

137
00:17:34.486 --> 00:17:38.650
Less than two days ago.
so the scent is still fresh.

138
00:17:40.092 --> 00:17:45.029
100 shilling for every child
you return alive.

139
00:17:46.031 --> 00:17:47.055
You better be fast

140
00:17:47.666 --> 00:17:50.601
before our mayor's witch hunters

141
00:17:50.702 --> 00:17:52.897
rob this town blind.

142
00:17:53.605 --> 00:17:54.697
You leave tonight.

143
00:17:57.476 --> 00:17:59.967
In witch country at night?

144
00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:01.205
You must be out of your mind.

145
00:18:51.196 --> 00:18:52.663
I'm telling you.

146
00:18:53.665 --> 00:18:55.223
we should put the fire out.

147
00:18:55.367 --> 00:18:56.493
We're hunting witches.

148
00:18:57.402 --> 00:19:00.303
not bears. And we have to eat.

149
00:19:25.697 --> 00:19:28.257
Such beautiful creatures.

150
00:19:31.937 --> 00:19:33.495
Are they yours?

151
00:19:34.273 --> 00:19:35.797
Yes. ma'am.

152
00:19:37.876 --> 00:19:39.844
Why have you come here?

153
00:19:41.046 --> 00:19:44.447
To the dark of the forest?

154
00:19:46.251 --> 00:19:47.878
A child was taken. ma'am.

155
00:19:50.088 --> 00:19:52.921
We're here to find him
and take him back.

156
00:19:54.359 --> 00:19:56.919
There are no children here.

157
00:20:00.432 --> 00:20:01.729
Here...

158
00:20:03.335 --> 00:20:04.893
There's only death!

159
00:20:07.239 --> 00:20:08.228
Witch!

160
00:20:09.241 --> 00:20:10.265
Fools!

161
00:20:12.044 --> 00:20:13.944
This is my land!

162
00:20:22.554 --> 00:20:24.522
How dare you?

163
00:20:34.399 --> 00:20:35.423
Please?

164
00:20:37.569 --> 00:20:39.628
Please. God... No.

165
00:20:39.738 --> 00:20:42.172
There's no use in praying. my friend.

166
00:20:43.208 --> 00:20:48.441
Even your God knows better
than to come here.

167
00:21:09.334 --> 00:21:12.132
There have been
abductions here and here.

168
00:21:12.237 --> 00:21:13.499
on both sides of the river.

169
00:21:14.006 --> 00:21:15.633
And on this last one.

170
00:21:16.141 --> 00:21:18.006
we believe a troll was involved.

171
00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.840
- A troll?
- Trolls are extra.

172
00:21:20.946 --> 00:21:22.413
Another round.

173
00:21:22.514 --> 00:21:25.312
It's really unusual. Look at this one.

174
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.441
A father and three children attacked.

175
00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.620
One child was taken.
but she didn't touch the other two.

176
00:21:31.323 --> 00:21:32.290
That's weird.

177
00:21:32.391 --> 00:21:33.517
That's so weird.

178
00:21:33.625 --> 00:21:36.423
- It is strange. It is strange. okay!
- Yeah. yeah.

179
00:21:36.528 --> 00:21:38.189
Then again.
we hunt witches for a living.

180
00:21:38.297 --> 00:21:39.389
What's normal. really?

181
00:21:39.498 --> 00:21:42.365
Excuse me. Hansel and Gretel?

182
00:21:42.501 --> 00:21:44.298
Oh. my God. I can't believe you're here.

183
00:21:44.403 --> 00:21:46.234
I'm Ben. Benjamin Walser.

184
00:21:46.338 --> 00:21:48.898
I am really quite a fan of your work.

185
00:21:49.007 --> 00:21:50.031
That's great.

186
00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:51.871
It's nice to meet you. Benjamin.

187
00:21:51.977 --> 00:21:53.604
Listen. if it's not too much trouble.

188
00:21:53.712 --> 00:21:55.407
- would you please sign...
- Oh. no...

189
00:21:55.514 --> 00:21:57.243
Okay.

190
00:21:57.349 --> 00:21:58.816
Oh. my.

191
00:21:58.917 --> 00:22:01.408
Yeah. that's from when you
found the Fox Witch of Antwerp

192
00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:02.612
and sank her in the moat.

193
00:22:02.721 --> 00:22:05.588
And this one's from the
Secret Witch Ring of Belsen.

194
00:22:05.691 --> 00:22:08.489
When they tried to put a gate to
hell under the courthouse.

195
00:22:08.593 --> 00:22:11.255
I mean. you guys. you certainly
taught those witches a thing or two.

196
00:22:11.363 --> 00:22:12.387
Wow.

197
00:22:12.497 --> 00:22:15.398
This is amazing. And weird.

198
00:22:15.534 --> 00:22:17.263
- A little creepy.
- Yeah...

199
00:22:17.369 --> 00:22:18.961
You really keep all this stuff.

200
00:22:19.071 --> 00:22:20.038
All right. well...

201
00:22:20.138 --> 00:22:22.732
I just have so many questions.
Do you mind?

202
00:22:22.841 --> 00:22:24.365
- You know. we have...
- Oh. no. no.

203
00:22:24.476 --> 00:22:26.103
- You go ahead.
- All right.

204
00:22:27.779 --> 00:22:30.839
Okay. How do you best kill a witch?

205
00:22:30.949 --> 00:22:31.973
Hansel?

206
00:22:33.552 --> 00:22:36.146
Cutting off their heads tends to work.

207
00:22:36.254 --> 00:22:37.482
Ripping out their hearts.

208
00:22:37.589 --> 00:22:39.352
And skinning them is also nice.

209
00:22:39.458 --> 00:22:41.392
Yeah. but burning is the best way.

210
00:22:41.493 --> 00:22:43.393
'Cause that's the only way to be safe.

211
00:22:43.495 --> 00:22:46.055
- Burning. yeah. of course.
- Burn them all.

212
00:22:46.164 --> 00:22:48.860
Is it true that witches can't harm you?

213
00:22:50.502 --> 00:22:52.629
Well. no. that is horseshit. son.

214
00:22:52.738 --> 00:22:54.399
Their magic doesn't work on us.

215
00:22:54.539 --> 00:22:57.099
And they haven't killed us. yet.

216
00:22:57.209 --> 00:22:58.471
Do you think that's because of

217
00:22:58.577 --> 00:23:00.875
the witch that you burned
when you were children?

218
00:23:01.012 --> 00:23:03.344
I guess that's how
it all started for you guys.

219
00:23:03.448 --> 00:23:05.609
I mean. is that how
you became witch hunters?

220
00:23:05.717 --> 00:23:06.809
How did you get your guns?

221
00:23:06.918 --> 00:23:08.146
- How did you get your weapons?
- Okay. okay.

222
00:23:08.253 --> 00:23:11.120
There's lots of things to do.
You're a really nice kid.

223
00:23:11.223 --> 00:23:13.316
but we have a town under attack.

224
00:23:17.929 --> 00:23:19.362
She killed them!

225
00:23:22.434 --> 00:23:23.833
She killed them all.

226
00:23:24.703 --> 00:23:26.227
Who killed what?

227
00:23:26.872 --> 00:23:27.998
The witch!

228
00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.031
She killed the trackers. All of them.

229
00:23:32.377 --> 00:23:34.641
She gave me a message.

230
00:23:35.847 --> 00:23:37.144
For you all.

231
00:23:56.802 --> 00:23:58.702
The Curse of Hunger
for Crawling Things.

232
00:24:02.574 --> 00:24:04.132
I fucking hate that one.

233
00:24:04.242 --> 00:24:06.733
That was awesome.

234
00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:01.823
It's working.

235
00:25:09.741 --> 00:25:12.437
It's not even warm.

236
00:25:12.544 --> 00:25:15.513
Muriel. this could change everything.

237
00:25:15.614 --> 00:25:19.050
It will change everything.

238
00:25:19.718 --> 00:25:23.210
We will be invincible.

239
00:25:23.321 --> 00:25:24.788
Take it out.

240
00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:27.690
Take it out! Take it out!

241
00:25:30.595 --> 00:25:32.324
It's of no use if it doesn't last.

242
00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:33.988
I can make it last.

243
00:25:36.735 --> 00:25:38.828
Forever.

244
00:26:06.264 --> 00:26:07.731
Where are we going?

245
00:26:08.633 --> 00:26:10.100
We're almost there.

246
00:26:19.444 --> 00:26:20.843
Hey.

247
00:26:21.913 --> 00:26:22.902
Hey.

248
00:26:23.782 --> 00:26:25.579
I just had this really weird dream.

249
00:26:26.618 --> 00:26:28.677
- Oh. yeah?
- Yeah.

250
00:26:28.787 --> 00:26:29.879
About what?

251
00:26:33.625 --> 00:26:36.560
I think it was about our mother.

252
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:40.359
We don't talk about that.

253
00:26:42.634 --> 00:26:43.931
Go to sleep.

254
00:27:17.602 --> 00:27:19.900
What do you think? Boy. girl?

255
00:27:20.372 --> 00:27:22.932
Okay. Here you go. I'll take this.

256
00:27:28.213 --> 00:27:29.976
A little small for you. maybe.

257
00:27:30.582 --> 00:27:32.277
Oh. hello.

258
00:27:32.884 --> 00:27:34.852
No. this. this is...

259
00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.017
This is not for me.

260
00:27:38.556 --> 00:27:41.150
So. how goes the witch hunting?

261
00:27:41.259 --> 00:27:43.887
It's good. Witch hunting's good.

262
00:27:48.066 --> 00:27:50.159
It's strange being among these people.

263
00:27:50.268 --> 00:27:51.292
Yeah?

264
00:27:52.103 --> 00:27:54.162
If you hadn't come.
they'd have burned me alive.

265
00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:57.037
Yeah. well. I probably
would have let them.

266
00:27:57.175 --> 00:27:59.075
but I'm old-fashioned that way.

267
00:27:59.244 --> 00:28:02.213
My sister. however.
requires a little bit more evidence

268
00:28:02.347 --> 00:28:03.678
before someone gets roasted.

269
00:28:07.385 --> 00:28:10.081
Have you ever come across a witch
that you didn't want to kill?

270
00:28:10.188 --> 00:28:11.519
No. never.

271
00:28:12.424 --> 00:28:14.324
The only good witch is a dead witch.

272
00:28:18.797 --> 00:28:20.424
Can you hold this?

273
00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.600
Are you all right?

274
00:28:29.974 --> 00:28:31.066
Yeah.

275
00:28:34.779 --> 00:28:36.337
When I was a kid.

276
00:28:37.182 --> 00:28:39.548
a witch made me eat
so much candy. I got sick.

277
00:28:40.719 --> 00:28:44.348
Something happened to me.
I have to take this injection

278
00:28:45.123 --> 00:28:47.023
every few hours or else I die.

279
00:28:48.626 --> 00:28:50.287
You have the sugar sickness.

280
00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:55.598
I actually know a thing or two about it
if you ever need any help...

281
00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.327
It's all right.

282
00:28:57.435 --> 00:28:59.096
- So...
- I'm fine.

283
00:29:07.145 --> 00:29:08.840
It was good seeing you.

284
00:29:08.947 --> 00:29:10.005
Yeah.

285
00:29:10.615 --> 00:29:12.173
You're very handsome.

286
00:29:12.917 --> 00:29:14.942
And no man in this town
will walk with me.

287
00:29:17.222 --> 00:29:18.849
And you have

288
00:29:19.624 --> 00:29:20.613
my pumpkin.

289
00:29:24.896 --> 00:29:26.761
I... I have to go.

290
00:29:27.732 --> 00:29:28.858
See you.

291
00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:47.179
It'll all be perfect.

292
00:29:47.285 --> 00:29:51.278
Daddy! Daddy. please help me! I'm lost!

293
00:29:54.959 --> 00:29:56.586
Daddy. please!

294
00:30:00.765 --> 00:30:02.892
Please help me! I'm lost!

295
00:30:05.303 --> 00:30:08.431
Daddy. I'm scared!
I'm alone in the woods!

296
00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:11.438
I can help you. little boy.

297
00:30:11.976 --> 00:30:13.466
Sweet little boy.

298
00:30:14.145 --> 00:30:15.237
Please help me!

299
00:30:16.147 --> 00:30:18.081
Daddy! I'm scared!

300
00:30:18.249 --> 00:30:20.046
I'm alone in the woods!

301
00:30:23.321 --> 00:30:24.788
<i>Please help...</i>

302
00:30:31.763 --> 00:30:33.492
You move. you die.

303
00:30:36.034 --> 00:30:37.228
Get her wand.

304
00:32:14.933 --> 00:32:16.457
I like your toys.

305
00:32:18.102 --> 00:32:22.004
They have brought
a live witch into my office!

306
00:32:22.173 --> 00:32:25.870
They need to interrogate her.
That's all there is to it. Now...

307
00:32:27.245 --> 00:32:30.043
Good night. Sheriff.

308
00:32:39.257 --> 00:32:42.055
You tell us what we want
and this might not end up

309
00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.128
being the most painful night of your life.

310
00:32:45.096 --> 00:32:46.563
- The children.
- Where are they?

311
00:32:47.465 --> 00:32:48.432
They still alive?

312
00:32:53.538 --> 00:32:55.335
These witches. they never learn.

313
00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.404
Let's try this again.

314
00:33:05.183 --> 00:33:08.414
Where are the children? Why so many?

315
00:33:09.587 --> 00:33:10.576
Where are the children?

316
00:33:10.688 --> 00:33:10.822
The blood of the twelve moons

317
00:33:10.822 --> 00:33:12.790
The blood of the twelve moons

318
00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:15.085
will soon be collected.

319
00:33:16.894 --> 00:33:18.191
And after that.

320
00:33:18.696 --> 00:33:21.995
only one object remains.

321
00:33:23.701 --> 00:33:25.430
Why don't you just burn her?

322
00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:27.870
We're wasting our time. She's useless.

323
00:33:27.972 --> 00:33:30.566
Twelve moons. Twelve...

324
00:33:30.708 --> 00:33:32.107
Twelve. twelve...

325
00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:34.508
How many children
have been taken so far?

326
00:33:34.946 --> 00:33:36.675
I don't know. ten or eleven.

327
00:33:36.781 --> 00:33:38.578
The files. We need to count them.

328
00:33:44.922 --> 00:33:47.550
- It's eleven.
- Eleven. Twelve moons.

329
00:33:47.658 --> 00:33:49.387
They need one more child.
One more child.

330
00:33:49.494 --> 00:33:50.961
Look.
there's got to be some sort of pattern.

331
00:33:51.062 --> 00:33:52.324
- Look for their age...
- Yeah.

332
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:53.795
...hair colour. genders. something.

333
00:33:53.898 --> 00:33:56.264
- I've got five girls.
- Six boys.

334
00:33:57.035 --> 00:33:58.093
You need another girl?

335
00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:00.201
"Twelve moons." what does that mean?

336
00:34:00.304 --> 00:34:01.931
It's a month. It's a month.

337
00:34:04.008 --> 00:34:05.908
There's no April. April is missing.
It's April.

338
00:34:06.077 --> 00:34:07.669
They need a girl born in April.

339
00:34:09.814 --> 00:34:11.213
You are too late.

340
00:34:20.725 --> 00:34:21.714
- Go!
- Yes!

341
00:34:24.195 --> 00:34:27.221
Sheriff. birth records of Augsburg.
Do you have them here?

342
00:34:27.365 --> 00:34:31.859
It is there.
Strictly for the law of this town. not for

343
00:34:31.969 --> 00:34:33.766
filthy bounty hunters like yourself.

344
00:34:33.871 --> 00:34:34.860
Come on.

345
00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:37.134
There can't be that many.

346
00:34:42.647 --> 00:34:43.807
- Anything?
- I only got one!

347
00:34:43.915 --> 00:34:45.712
Little girl. six years old. born April 8th.

348
00:34:46.884 --> 00:34:48.442
- She's the only one I could find.
- You go.

349
00:34:49.487 --> 00:34:50.545
This girl. do you know her?

350
00:34:50.655 --> 00:34:52.555
Yes. I know her. Mary Behlmer.

351
00:34:52.657 --> 00:34:54.955
Where does she live?
Sheriff. she's in danger!

352
00:35:05.002 --> 00:35:06.094
Fire! Fire!

353
00:35:08.306 --> 00:35:10.331
Time is up. Tell me where she lives.

354
00:35:24.155 --> 00:35:25.383
Over here!

355
00:35:32.964 --> 00:35:35.125
Mama!

356
00:35:40.571 --> 00:35:42.232
Stop! Stop right there!

357
00:35:45.543 --> 00:35:47.738
Oh. no! No. no. Oh. no.

358
00:35:48.012 --> 00:35:49.707
No. Lucas! Lucas.

359
00:35:51.649 --> 00:35:52.741
No!

360
00:35:57.555 --> 00:35:59.546
Damn you!

361
00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:05.189
Take her back!

362
00:36:14.238 --> 00:36:15.637
To the well!

363
00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:16.798
Over here!

364
00:36:17.608 --> 00:36:19.838
We need more help!

365
00:36:27.752 --> 00:36:30.220
Now whatever happens.
I want you to stay cool.

366
00:36:31.155 --> 00:36:34.022
- Follow my lead. Okay?
- Got it.

367
00:36:34.125 --> 00:36:35.786
Are you a good shot?

368
00:36:35.893 --> 00:36:37.224
No.

369
00:36:37.328 --> 00:36:38.761
Not really.

370
00:36:40.965 --> 00:36:42.227
That's why I use a shotgun.

371
00:36:55.379 --> 00:36:56.505
Gretel.

372
00:36:57.081 --> 00:36:58.708
the famous witch hunter.

373
00:37:00.318 --> 00:37:01.751
Finally we meet.

374
00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:03.312
Who are you?

375
00:37:06.557 --> 00:37:07.956
I see you got my invitation.

376
00:37:08.759 --> 00:37:11.523
Say your name
before my arrows rip out your throat.

377
00:37:12.396 --> 00:37:13.658
I go by many names.

378
00:37:14.732 --> 00:37:18.327
none of which
you're worthy of pronouncing.

379
00:37:23.741 --> 00:37:24.730
Oh. my God.

380
00:37:44.195 --> 00:37:45.457
Help! Help!

381
00:37:47.198 --> 00:37:48.256
Please!

382
00:37:50.001 --> 00:37:50.990
Hey!

383
00:38:04.682 --> 00:38:06.582
Help!

384
00:38:25.169 --> 00:38:27.160
Shit.

385
00:38:40.885 --> 00:38:44.048
Don't worry. I'm not going to kill you.

386
00:38:44.722 --> 00:38:45.916
Not now.

387
00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:48.315
And not like this.

388
00:38:50.695 --> 00:38:52.390
You

389
00:38:52.496 --> 00:38:54.259
have something I need.

390
00:38:55.433 --> 00:38:58.061
The last ingredient.

391
00:39:22.827 --> 00:39:26.627
Humans have such ghastly taste.

392
00:39:37.074 --> 00:39:39.065
I think this place...

393
00:39:43.581 --> 00:39:45.378
...could use a bit

394
00:39:50.221 --> 00:39:51.848
of colour.

395
00:40:10.775 --> 00:40:12.436
Shit!

396
00:40:46.977 --> 00:40:48.376
- Good morning.
- What are you doing?

397
00:40:48.479 --> 00:40:52.040
You were covered in filth. so I was just

398
00:40:52.883 --> 00:40:54.077
cleaning.

399
00:41:06.063 --> 00:41:07.621
What happened?

400
00:41:10.334 --> 00:41:10.468
Well. the witches took a young girl.

401
00:41:10.468 --> 00:41:11.958
Well. the witches took a young girl.

402
00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:14.537
and a lot of people died in the fires.

403
00:41:15.005 --> 00:41:17.200
And now the Sheriff.
he's blaming you and your brother

404
00:41:17.308 --> 00:41:18.502
for what happened last night.

405
00:41:19.343 --> 00:41:21.140
Augsburg's not really
safe for you anymore.

406
00:41:21.245 --> 00:41:22.576
And my brother?

407
00:41:22.746 --> 00:41:24.077
Last time I saw him.
he was fighting one of them

408
00:41:24.181 --> 00:41:26.411
on her broom. flying out of town.

409
00:41:33.357 --> 00:41:34.483
Right.

410
00:41:36.427 --> 00:41:37.724
Wow.

411
00:41:38.429 --> 00:41:40.329
Where did you get all this stuff?

412
00:41:41.966 --> 00:41:43.263
From everywhere.

413
00:41:43.868 --> 00:41:46.632
I actually plan to be a witch hunter.
too. when I get older.

414
00:41:46.737 --> 00:41:47.704
Like you guys.

415
00:41:48.639 --> 00:41:50.402
This isn't the life we chose. Ben.

416
00:41:55.379 --> 00:41:57.506
I was wondering about that story

417
00:41:58.549 --> 00:42:00.676
about your parents leaving you.

418
00:42:01.218 --> 00:42:02.685
Is all that true?

419
00:42:03.387 --> 00:42:04.411
Yep.

420
00:42:07.391 --> 00:42:08.517
Why?

421
00:42:10.561 --> 00:42:11.858
I don't know.

422
00:42:12.563 --> 00:42:14.190
That's what they did.

423
00:42:19.403 --> 00:42:22.372
I'm sorry. Do you want some porridge?

424
00:42:23.407 --> 00:42:24.704
Sure.

425
00:42:34.919 --> 00:42:39.049
Not too hot. not too cold. but just right.

426
00:42:47.665 --> 00:42:48.962
So last night.

427
00:42:49.099 --> 00:42:51.659
who was she.
the witch who attacked us?

428
00:42:52.903 --> 00:42:53.892
I don't know.

429
00:42:54.004 --> 00:42:57.963
She looked normal
at first. but then she changed her face.

430
00:42:58.909 --> 00:43:01.434
- I thought only Grand...
- Grand Witches have that ability. yeah.

431
00:43:11.055 --> 00:43:13.080
Who is this?

432
00:43:16.093 --> 00:43:18.926
She lived outside of town
a long time ago.

433
00:43:21.065 --> 00:43:23.761
<i>She was accused of witchcraft.
but she never confessed.</i>

434
00:43:24.802 --> 00:43:26.565
We just burned her anyway.

435
00:43:27.271 --> 00:43:28.329
You're safe.

436
00:43:29.406 --> 00:43:30.395
You'll be safe.

437
00:43:34.945 --> 00:43:36.469
I have to find my brother.

438
00:43:39.183 --> 00:43:40.480
Hansel!

439
00:43:41.552 --> 00:43:42.576
Hey!

440
00:43:42.753 --> 00:43:44.345
Hansel! Are you all right?

441
00:43:47.758 --> 00:43:49.385
Oh. shit.

442
00:43:51.762 --> 00:43:53.525
The witch hunting is going well. I see.

443
00:43:54.031 --> 00:43:55.157
Yeah.

444
00:43:57.901 --> 00:43:59.368
Hey. say. can you...

445
00:44:00.437 --> 00:44:03.099
Can you tell me
which way is back to town?

446
00:44:04.041 --> 00:44:05.030
That way.

447
00:44:06.977 --> 00:44:08.103
That way.

448
00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:10.572
Okay.

449
00:44:10.981 --> 00:44:12.107
Thank you!

450
00:44:13.317 --> 00:44:15.148
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

451
00:44:16.854 --> 00:44:19.584
- You need some help?
- No. I'm fine.

452
00:44:19.957 --> 00:44:21.584
I'm fine. Thank you.

453
00:44:22.726 --> 00:44:24.956
Okay. I'll see you later.

454
00:44:25.362 --> 00:44:26.727
Mother...

455
00:44:31.969 --> 00:44:33.231
Are you okay?

456
00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:34.835
Hi. Help me.

457
00:44:43.814 --> 00:44:45.338
Hansel!

458
00:44:50.821 --> 00:44:52.448
Hansel!

459
00:44:58.262 --> 00:44:59.320
Are you done yet?

460
00:44:59.763 --> 00:45:01.492
I've got to get to my sister.

461
00:45:02.366 --> 00:45:04.027
This may take a while.

462
00:45:07.438 --> 00:45:09.565
But if we don't clean it.
you'll get the fever.

463
00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:11.805
Fever?

464
00:45:14.445 --> 00:45:16.242
You've really taken a beating.
haven't you?

465
00:45:17.781 --> 00:45:20.807
I think the real damage
was to my dignity.

466
00:45:21.685 --> 00:45:23.983
which I left somewhere
in that tree back there.

467
00:45:33.297 --> 00:45:35.356
It's probably going to be easier
if you just get in.

468
00:45:37.201 --> 00:45:38.793
Oh. no. no. No. I can't.

469
00:45:39.136 --> 00:45:40.467
The water is healing.

470
00:45:41.371 --> 00:45:43.771
Yeah. I don't swim well.

471
00:45:44.374 --> 00:45:46.274
Then I'll go in with you.

472
00:45:49.546 --> 00:45:51.173
Oh. okay.

473
00:46:00.057 --> 00:46:01.456
Oh. boy.

474
00:46:11.335 --> 00:46:13.701
So. it's healing waters. did you say?

475
00:46:18.308 --> 00:46:22.108
You know. the last time
I was in waters like this.

476
00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:25.872
I came across
a formidable Serpent Witch.

477
00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:28.650
She mostly looked like a toad

478
00:46:28.752 --> 00:46:29.878
but she could breathe underwater.

479
00:46:30.187 --> 00:46:32.655
which made her difficult to track.

480
00:46:35.192 --> 00:46:36.625
She was deadly.

481
00:46:37.828 --> 00:46:39.625
You talk too much.

482
00:46:45.803 --> 00:46:47.293
Hansel!

483
00:46:54.011 --> 00:46:55.638
Hansel!

484
00:47:42.626 --> 00:47:43.786
Come here.

485
00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:52.164
She's a wild one. eh?

486
00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:54.837
What do you think you're doing?

487
00:47:54.972 --> 00:47:59.306
You're under arrest
for the burning of Augsburg

488
00:47:59.476 --> 00:48:01.740
and for bringing
the witch plague to our streets.

489
00:48:01.879 --> 00:48:05.007
Listen. you idiot! The witches are
planning something big!

490
00:48:05.115 --> 00:48:07.242
I need to find my brother
and save your shitty little...

491
00:48:07.351 --> 00:48:08.818
Shut up.

492
00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:11.217
This time.

493
00:48:11.922 --> 00:48:15.551
I do the talking. You do the bleeding.

494
00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:24.158
Bitch!

495
00:48:36.213 --> 00:48:38.841
You're making this too easy.

496
00:48:42.619 --> 00:48:44.746
You want some more? Huh?

497
00:48:51.628 --> 00:48:52.754
What

498
00:48:53.797 --> 00:48:55.025
the hell?

499
00:49:02.873 --> 00:49:03.840
No!

500
00:50:02.188 --> 00:50:03.519
Following this road.
you should be able to

501
00:50:03.656 --> 00:50:05.988
make it back to Augsburg by nightfall.

502
00:50:06.425 --> 00:50:07.551
Yeah.

503
00:50:08.828 --> 00:50:10.125
I hope so.

504
00:50:11.097 --> 00:50:12.860
When you find your sister.

505
00:50:12.965 --> 00:50:14.899
could you come back to see me again?

506
00:50:17.169 --> 00:50:18.966
Yes. of course.

507
00:50:54.173 --> 00:50:55.140
Drink.

508
00:50:56.042 --> 00:50:57.009
No.

509
00:50:59.545 --> 00:51:01.604
Drink!

510
00:51:38.250 --> 00:51:40.218
Why did you save me?

511
00:51:43.022 --> 00:51:44.080
Trolls

512
00:51:44.657 --> 00:51:47.125
serve witches.

513
00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:55.397
Hey. wait.

514
00:51:56.802 --> 00:51:58.565
Wait!

515
00:52:04.043 --> 00:52:05.340
What's your name?

516
00:52:07.813 --> 00:52:09.781
Edward.

517
00:52:13.486 --> 00:52:14.475
Edward. wait!

518
00:52:15.488 --> 00:52:16.819
Where am I?

519
00:53:33.399 --> 00:53:34.696
Hansel?

520
00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:35.892
Gretel?

521
00:53:36.001 --> 00:53:36.968
Where have you been?

522
00:53:37.102 --> 00:53:38.296
Where have you been?

523
00:53:46.478 --> 00:53:47.604
- Hi.
- Hi.

524
00:53:47.746 --> 00:53:49.043
Hey. what happened to your face?

525
00:53:50.649 --> 00:53:52.139
Gretel?

526
00:53:52.251 --> 00:53:53.309
- Who did this to you?
- I'm okay.

527
00:53:53.419 --> 00:53:54.386
Who did this to you?

528
00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:55.487
I'm okay.

529
00:53:57.590 --> 00:53:59.217
Honey. I'm sorry.

530
00:54:00.426 --> 00:54:01.893
I'm sorry.

531
00:54:07.766 --> 00:54:09.063
You okay?

532
00:54:09.602 --> 00:54:10.899
I'm okay.

533
00:54:16.275 --> 00:54:17.572
Where are we?

534
00:54:19.111 --> 00:54:20.305
I don't know.

535
00:54:23.349 --> 00:54:24.373
You okay?

536
00:54:24.483 --> 00:54:26.178
Did you have to land on me?

537
00:54:30.122 --> 00:54:31.749
What is this place?

538
00:54:45.638 --> 00:54:47.731
This isn't a regular witch's lair.

539
00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:48.898
No.

540
00:54:50.709 --> 00:54:53.007
Let's get the hell out of here.

541
00:55:04.423 --> 00:55:05.720
Hey. sis?

542
00:55:08.093 --> 00:55:10.527
I think you're going to
want to come see this.

543
00:55:20.773 --> 00:55:23.241
I think this is our old house.

544
00:55:24.943 --> 00:55:26.740
And this is our old room.

545
00:55:29.114 --> 00:55:30.411
Here. Look.

546
00:55:31.383 --> 00:55:32.680
There's your bed.

547
00:55:33.619 --> 00:55:34.677
Right?

548
00:55:39.024 --> 00:55:40.286
Remember this?

549
00:55:46.298 --> 00:55:47.765
I think that's you.

550
00:55:48.467 --> 00:55:51.095
And some sort of vicious badger.

551
00:55:56.975 --> 00:55:58.602
Old beds.

552
00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:09.117
Hansel.

553
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:14.959
You ever wonder
what happened to our parents?

554
00:56:22.134 --> 00:56:24.261
We don't talk about that. Gretel.

555
00:56:24.403 --> 00:56:25.927
We made a promise. you know that.

556
00:56:26.472 --> 00:56:28.599
Why do you think
the witches' spells don't work on us?

557
00:56:28.741 --> 00:56:29.708
Leave it alone.

558
00:56:29.808 --> 00:56:31.366
- This is our house.
- Yeah?

559
00:56:31.477 --> 00:56:32.944
This is where we grew up!

560
00:56:33.045 --> 00:56:34.979
And what does that look like to you?

561
00:56:35.481 --> 00:56:37.881
I don't know. Gretel.
We grew up over a witch's lair.

562
00:56:37.983 --> 00:56:39.007
So what? So we're cursed?

563
00:56:39.118 --> 00:56:41.018
No. I think that our mother was...

564
00:56:43.522 --> 00:56:48.391
I see you finally found your way
home after all these years.

565
00:56:49.094 --> 00:56:50.891
How very sweet.

566
00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:04.008
I remember this house.

567
00:57:04.543 --> 00:57:06.511
The house of Adrianna.

568
00:57:07.379 --> 00:57:09.574
the Great White Witch.

569
00:57:11.717 --> 00:57:14.379
Your whore of a mother.

570
00:57:18.590 --> 00:57:21.024
Let me tell you a little story.

571
00:57:26.899 --> 00:57:31.029
Once upon a time.
near a shitty little town.

572
00:57:32.070 --> 00:57:36.837
there was a farmer who fell
in love with a white witch.

573
00:57:37.576 --> 00:57:40.204
<i>And with their two beautiful children.</i>

574
00:57:40.579 --> 00:57:43.047
<i>oh. they were so happy.</i>

575
00:57:44.583 --> 00:57:47.051
<i>But not for long.</i>

576
00:57:49.421 --> 00:57:52.879
<i>During a Blood Moon. there is a potion</i>

577
00:57:53.258 --> 00:57:56.056
<i>that will make you immune to fire.</i>

578
00:57:57.262 --> 00:57:59.389
<i>The key to the potion</i>

579
00:57:59.498 --> 00:58:03.798
<i>is the heart of a Grand White Witch.</i>

580
00:58:04.937 --> 00:58:08.805
<i>But your mother.
the most powerful white witch.</i>

581
00:58:08.941 --> 00:58:10.909
<i>was too strong for us.</i>

582
00:58:11.610 --> 00:58:13.874
<i>So it had to be you. Gretel.</i>

583
00:58:14.246 --> 00:58:17.511
<i>It had to be your heart.</i>

584
00:58:18.417 --> 00:58:22.444
<i>As the Blood Moon approached.
I sent out a little rumour</i>

585
00:58:23.422 --> 00:58:25.413
<i>to the people of Augsburg.</i>

586
00:58:26.158 --> 00:58:28.285
<i>And when she knew they were coming.</i>

587
00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:31.490
<i>she had your father take you
into the forest to hide you.</i>

588
00:58:31.597 --> 00:58:32.928
Father! Wait!

589
00:58:34.066 --> 00:58:35.055
Don't let her get away!

590
00:58:35.167 --> 00:58:36.828
<i>She didn't know what
they would do to her.</i>

591
00:58:36.935 --> 00:58:39.233
<i>but she was too proud to run.</i>

592
00:58:39.605 --> 00:58:43.541
<i>And a white witch would never use her
magic against humans.</i>

593
00:58:45.244 --> 00:58:47.235
<i>When your father came back for her...</i>

594
00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:49.469
No!

595
00:58:49.581 --> 00:58:51.344
<i>... they hanged him.</i>

596
00:58:51.450 --> 00:58:53.577
- Run him up!
- No!

597
00:58:55.454 --> 00:58:57.752
<i>... right in front</i>

598
00:58:58.457 --> 00:59:02.086
<i>of your mother's burning flesh!</i>

599
00:59:09.701 --> 00:59:11.168
<i>Adrianna was gone.</i>

600
00:59:13.205 --> 00:59:15.435
<i>But so was your heart.</i>

601
00:59:17.142 --> 00:59:19.770
<i>And the Blood Moon passed.</i>

602
00:59:20.712 --> 00:59:22.009
The end.

603
00:59:22.814 --> 00:59:25.647
It's a beautiful story. don't you think?

604
00:59:26.818 --> 00:59:29.446
They died to save you.

605
00:59:31.723 --> 00:59:32.951
And all your life.

606
00:59:33.091 --> 00:59:35.150
how you've hated them.

607
00:59:35.661 --> 00:59:37.390
Tomorrow

608
00:59:37.496 --> 00:59:40.829
sisters from all dark corners of the land

609
00:59:40.933 --> 00:59:43.663
will join me in the light
of the Blood Moon

610
00:59:44.169 --> 00:59:46.637
for the greatest Sabbath of all.

611
00:59:47.673 --> 00:59:49.470
The only thing left

612
00:59:50.342 --> 00:59:52.640
is the everlasting power

613
00:59:53.178 --> 00:59:54.805
of the heart

614
00:59:55.247 --> 00:59:57.477
of a Grand White Witch.

615
00:59:57.583 --> 00:59:58.709
You know. you talk too much.

616
01:00:09.528 --> 01:00:11.894
Bad move. witch hunter.

617
01:00:17.703 --> 01:00:19.330
Hansel!

618
01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:31.348
Drink it. It will help the pain.

619
01:00:34.553 --> 01:00:35.679
Mina?

620
01:00:42.227 --> 01:00:43.785
What did you do?

621
01:00:43.895 --> 01:00:45.362
Mina?

622
01:00:52.471 --> 01:00:53.768
You're a witch?

623
01:00:53.972 --> 01:00:56.065
There are good witches in the world.

624
01:00:56.208 --> 01:00:58.369
- Not many. but some.
- You stay back.

625
01:00:58.644 --> 01:00:59.975
I'm a witch. but I won't hurt you.

626
01:01:00.145 --> 01:01:02.443
I checked you. You were...
You were clean.

627
01:01:02.547 --> 01:01:04.674
Yeah. but only the dark witches
bear the signs.

628
01:01:04.816 --> 01:01:07.216
Dark witches?
What are you talking about?

629
01:01:07.386 --> 01:01:08.353
Think about it.

630
01:01:08.487 --> 01:01:11.456
if their spells don't work on you.
why would mine?

631
01:01:12.491 --> 01:01:14.118
I'm not like them. Hansel.

632
01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:20.728
Gretel. Shit.

633
01:01:22.267 --> 01:01:24.895
- Where are you going?
- They have my sister.

634
01:01:25.037 --> 01:01:26.664
Who has your sister?

635
01:01:26.772 --> 01:01:28.740
Witches have my sister. They...

636
01:01:28.974 --> 01:01:30.601
- Where?
- They said something

637
01:01:31.176 --> 01:01:34.270
about a ritual or a gathering.
I don't know.

638
01:01:34.446 --> 01:01:37.643
There's a place deep in the forest.
nearby the mountains.

639
01:01:37.849 --> 01:01:40.943
A place dark witches use
for their Sabbath.

640
01:01:41.119 --> 01:01:42.347
Where is it?

641
01:01:42.454 --> 01:01:43.421
Hansel. I...

642
01:01:43.522 --> 01:01:44.887
Mina. how do I get there?

643
01:01:45.023 --> 01:01:46.820
If there is a Sabbath.
there will be many witches.

644
01:01:46.925 --> 01:01:49.587
They'll be too powerful.
They'll kill you. Hansel.

645
01:01:50.462 --> 01:01:51.861
I don't have time for this.

646
01:01:52.030 --> 01:01:55.329
No. listen. Hansel.
I found something here. in this cave.

647
01:01:56.134 --> 01:01:59.934
Something very powerful.
Something that could help us.

648
01:02:00.639 --> 01:02:03.403
<i>The Abramelin Grimoire! It exists!</i>

649
01:02:03.508 --> 01:02:05.271
This is the book
of protection against black magic.

650
01:02:06.912 --> 01:02:09.380
I can't believe this.
Where did you find it?

651
01:02:09.481 --> 01:02:11.005
Don't ask. kid.

652
01:02:11.183 --> 01:02:12.548
If this thing does what it says.

653
01:02:12.651 --> 01:02:14.380
it will allow us
to penetrate their protection.

654
01:02:14.486 --> 01:02:15.453
Oh. yeah?

655
01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:18.214
Their wands won't
protect them anymore.

656
01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:19.357
We just need something to bless.

657
01:02:19.524 --> 01:02:21.822
Okay. let's start with this.

658
01:02:46.518 --> 01:02:48.713
I hope this works.

659
01:02:58.029 --> 01:02:59.326
You ever shoot a gun?

660
01:03:00.532 --> 01:03:03.000
Well. I did win the county fair

661
01:03:04.035 --> 01:03:05.468
three times.

662
01:03:07.205 --> 01:03:09.503
All right. In that case...

663
01:03:13.879 --> 01:03:15.744
Don't touch the gun.

664
01:03:32.564 --> 01:03:33.531
Edward.

665
01:03:35.066 --> 01:03:36.693
What are you doing here?

666
01:03:38.970 --> 01:03:40.437
What's going on?

667
01:03:44.409 --> 01:03:46.036
Muriel.

668
01:03:52.751 --> 01:03:54.184
Edward.

669
01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:56.480
I need your help.

670
01:04:01.426 --> 01:04:03.053
Please. Edward.

671
01:04:06.331 --> 01:04:10.233
Hey! You filthy oaf!

672
01:04:10.335 --> 01:04:12.803
Get the children. We're moving out.

673
01:04:17.776 --> 01:04:20.404
It's time.

674
01:04:30.856 --> 01:04:31.914
Okay. are we good?

675
01:04:32.757 --> 01:04:33.883
Yes.

676
01:04:45.036 --> 01:04:48.597
Well. as far as you go. kid.

677
01:04:49.541 --> 01:04:52.339
But. I will leave you with this.

678
01:04:54.546 --> 01:04:56.207
- Wow!
- Find a place to hide.

679
01:04:56.348 --> 01:04:57.406
Shoot anything that moves.

680
01:04:59.050 --> 01:05:00.347
Good luck.

681
01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:23.037
Shut up!

682
01:05:46.064 --> 01:05:47.429
After tonight.

683
01:05:48.233 --> 01:05:51.532
no sister will be burned on their pyres!

684
01:05:53.672 --> 01:05:56.903
No sister will be ashes on the ground!

685
01:05:57.108 --> 01:05:59.076
I want your brains!

686
01:05:59.978 --> 01:06:00.945
And now.

687
01:06:02.247 --> 01:06:04.977
now we feast!

688
01:06:05.650 --> 01:06:07.345
That's a lot of witches.

689
01:06:08.386 --> 01:06:09.353
Okay.

690
01:06:09.921 --> 01:06:11.946
I'm going to go down
around the other side.

691
01:06:12.424 --> 01:06:15.052
Push them into the middle.
get them away from the kids.

692
01:06:15.327 --> 01:06:18.057
Now. when you see my signal.
you unleash hell.

693
01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:19.727
Wish me luck.

694
01:06:28.039 --> 01:06:29.438
Yes.

695
01:06:30.809 --> 01:06:33.642
The hour has come!

696
01:06:34.446 --> 01:06:37.244
The Blood Moon arrives!

697
01:06:37.949 --> 01:06:43.546
The Grand White Witch dies!

698
01:06:50.128 --> 01:06:52.255
Listen to me carefully!

699
01:06:52.964 --> 01:06:56.422
If you let my sister
and the children go now.

700
01:06:56.968 --> 01:07:00.267
I'll consider not killing
each and every one of you.

701
01:07:01.473 --> 01:07:02.940
- Finish him.
- Yes.

702
01:07:13.318 --> 01:07:14.683
Please work.

703
01:08:05.703 --> 01:08:09.161
We have to hurry. You get the children.
I'll get her heart!

704
01:08:09.641 --> 01:08:10.938
Now. move!

705
01:08:39.737 --> 01:08:40.863
Walk!

706
01:08:41.239 --> 01:08:42.365
Move it!

707
01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:49.638
Come on!

708
01:08:49.747 --> 01:08:50.714
Gretel!

709
01:08:56.354 --> 01:08:57.548
Edward.

710
01:08:58.022 --> 01:08:58.989
Gretel!

711
01:09:00.058 --> 01:09:02.322
I'm okay! Go get the children!

712
01:09:03.928 --> 01:09:04.986
Stay still!

713
01:09:07.932 --> 01:09:10.059
Get off of me!

714
01:09:29.354 --> 01:09:30.480
No!

715
01:09:43.301 --> 01:09:44.598
Thank you!

716
01:10:13.364 --> 01:10:14.729
- Shit!
- Too late.

717
01:10:24.008 --> 01:10:25.134
Gretel!

718
01:10:47.532 --> 01:10:48.999
Well. where are you going?

719
01:10:49.234 --> 01:10:50.531
I have to help Edward!

720
01:10:50.802 --> 01:10:53.771
Edward. Who the fuck's Edward?

721
01:11:42.053 --> 01:11:44.146
- Hell. yeah!
- Ben!

722
01:11:45.790 --> 01:11:47.451
Hansel! Hansel!

723
01:11:47.625 --> 01:11:49.684
I did it! I shot her! Muriel.

724
01:11:49.794 --> 01:11:52.763
- Where?
- I shot her down. over there.

725
01:11:52.897 --> 01:11:54.023
Good job.

726
01:12:01.406 --> 01:12:02.873
She's close.

727
01:12:14.285 --> 01:12:15.445
Edward?

728
01:12:59.597 --> 01:13:01.497
You can't be serious.

729
01:13:15.079 --> 01:13:16.546
Is this...

730
01:13:16.981 --> 01:13:18.539
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

731
01:13:19.517 --> 01:13:20.484
Wow.

732
01:13:20.752 --> 01:13:24.711
Whatever you do.
don't eat the fucking candy.

733
01:13:36.667 --> 01:13:38.965
Stop right there.

734
01:13:39.370 --> 01:13:41.065
or the little boy dies.

735
01:13:42.306 --> 01:13:45.275
I thought it would
be fitting for us to end up here.

736
01:13:45.643 --> 01:13:47.167
where it all began.

737
01:13:47.812 --> 01:13:50.280
Kind of lost its charm a little. huh?

738
01:13:50.882 --> 01:13:52.179
Drop it.

739
01:13:57.722 --> 01:13:58.689
Good boy.

740
01:14:00.324 --> 01:14:01.291
Don't worry. kid.

741
01:14:03.161 --> 01:14:04.287
I'm not going to let her hurt you.

742
01:14:04.529 --> 01:14:05.496
Oh. really?

743
01:14:06.330 --> 01:14:07.627
Really.

744
01:14:17.842 --> 01:14:19.537
The end is near.

745
01:14:20.411 --> 01:14:21.639
witch hunter.

746
01:14:23.681 --> 01:14:28.516
I wish I could say
it would be painless. but that

747
01:14:29.387 --> 01:14:31.321
would be a lie.

748
01:14:38.729 --> 01:14:39.753
Get away from him.

749
01:14:41.232 --> 01:14:43.530
Always funny seeing
a white witch with a wand.

750
01:14:45.470 --> 01:14:48.371
What are you going to do?
Hit me with your love spell?

751
01:14:52.243 --> 01:14:53.710
Not bad.

752
01:14:59.750 --> 01:15:03.208
Sacrificing yourself to save a human.

753
01:15:03.921 --> 01:15:05.218
Pathetic.

754
01:15:10.761 --> 01:15:12.490
No!

755
01:15:18.870 --> 01:15:20.394
Mina. Hey.

756
01:15:20.972 --> 01:15:22.166
Come here.

757
01:15:26.110 --> 01:15:27.407
Hansel.

758
01:15:31.282 --> 01:15:32.249
Hansel.

759
01:15:33.050 --> 01:15:34.517
I tried to stop her.

760
01:15:34.785 --> 01:15:36.980
You did. You did good.

761
01:15:38.456 --> 01:15:39.923
You did good.

762
01:16:11.489 --> 01:16:13.684
You got to be fucking kidding me.

763
01:17:19.123 --> 01:17:20.784
Oh. please.

764
01:17:20.958 --> 01:17:22.152
Please?

765
01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:23.850
Please. stop.

766
01:17:25.529 --> 01:17:26.757
Please.

767
01:17:26.964 --> 01:17:27.953
Yeah. nice try.

768
01:18:40.938 --> 01:18:42.098
Finish her already.

769
01:19:05.529 --> 01:19:08.089
<i>Revenge doesn't change the past.</i>

770
01:19:12.303 --> 01:19:14.328
<i>It won't bring our parents back.</i>

771
01:19:14.705 --> 01:19:16.673
- You all right?
- Oh. yeah.

772
01:19:16.974 --> 01:19:18.601
Glad to hear it.

773
01:19:19.477 --> 01:19:20.705
<i>But it sure as hell feels good.</i>

774
01:19:24.648 --> 01:19:27.014
<i>My sister and I know the truth.</i>

775
01:19:28.886 --> 01:19:30.854
<i>We know who we are now.</i>

776
01:19:32.757 --> 01:19:34.156
<i>And so do they.</i>

777
01:19:36.694 --> 01:19:38.491
<i>They know our story.</i>

778
01:19:39.263 --> 01:19:40.730
<i>our powers.</i>

779
01:19:41.732 --> 01:19:42.756
<i>what we can do.</i>

780
01:19:45.035 --> 01:19:46.662
<i>And they should fear us.</i>

781
01:19:49.907 --> 01:19:50.874
<i>All of us.</i>

782
01:19:51.375 --> 01:19:53.036
We should be getting close now.

783
01:19:53.277 --> 01:19:55.575
And so after this next one.
we've got three more to go.

784
01:19:55.846 --> 01:19:59.304
Three? You said three more
three witches ago.

785
01:19:59.550 --> 01:20:01.745
Come on. you always say.
more witches. more money. right?

786
01:20:01.952 --> 01:20:03.852
Yeah. but you ain't getting any of it.

787
01:20:03.954 --> 01:20:05.182
Unless you want to pull the cart.

788
01:20:07.424 --> 01:20:08.721
Right. big guy?

789
01:20:08.993 --> 01:20:10.153
I told you he'd come in handy.

790
01:20:12.062 --> 01:20:14.360
<i>There are good witches in the world.</i>

791
01:20:15.065 --> 01:20:16.692
<i>We know that now.</i>

792
01:20:17.568 --> 01:20:21.129
<i>But for the ones practicing
the black arts. beware.</i>

793
01:20:21.238 --> 01:20:22.899
<i>We're coming for you.</i>

794
01:20:23.641 --> 01:20:26.269
<i>No matter where you are. we'll find you.</i>

795
01:20:28.145 --> 01:20:29.874
<i>And dead or alive.</i>

796
01:20:30.881 --> 01:20:32.314
<i>we'll take you down.</i>

797
01:20:32.683 --> 01:20:34.913
Edward. want to knock?

798
01:20:35.286 --> 01:20:36.617
<i>My vote:</i>

799
01:20:37.521 --> 01:20:39.045
<i>Dead.</i>

800
01:21:04.415 --> 01:21:07.816
I hate to break it to you.
but it's not going to be an open casket.
