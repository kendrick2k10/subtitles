WEBVTT

1
00:00:36.662 --> 00:00:37.872
Here we go.

2
00:00:37.955 --> 00:00:40.374
One. two...

3
00:00:40.458 --> 00:00:41.667
You guys wanna story?

4
00:00:43.169 --> 00:00:44.920
Yeah. I got a story.
A fuckin' doozy.

5
00:00:45.004 --> 00:00:47.048
Is this the one
where you say you own Facebook?

6
00:00:47.131 --> 00:00:49.800
Starts like this.
On the seventh day. God rested.

7
00:00:49.884 --> 00:00:51.343
I love God.
He's my favourite God.

8
00:00:51.427 --> 00:00:53.345
Yeah. but he's God. so he knew
that if after six days of

9
00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:54.555
crazy you gotta rest on Sunday.

10
00:00:54.638 --> 00:00:56.015
Rest every day.

11
00:00:56.098 --> 00:00:57.892
But what about those poor
bastards going through six days

12
00:00:57.975 --> 00:01:00.478
of crazy. not knowing that the
seventh day is going to be a day

13
00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:02.897
of rest. or just another
day at the shit storm?

14
00:01:04.023 --> 00:01:05.274
Those are the poor
bastards we should toast.

15
00:01:05.357 --> 00:01:06.317
To the shit storm!

16
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.195
Who knows. maybe a couple
of angels come along

17
00:01:09.278 --> 00:01:10.279
and nudge him in the
right direction.

18
00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:12.073
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

19
00:01:12.156 --> 00:01:14.909
This is the story of
Frank and Nancy Teagarten.

20
00:01:14.992 --> 00:01:17.495
Their seven days started on
the morning they dropped

21
00:01:17.578 --> 00:01:18.746
their daughter off at college.

22
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.458
Wow.

23
00:01:24.376 --> 00:01:26.212
Seems just like yesterday
I was pushing you on the swings

24
00:01:26.295 --> 00:01:27.755
in Gardner Park.

25
00:01:27.838 --> 00:01:29.048
Yeah.

26
00:01:29.131 --> 00:01:32.426
And now.
look at our college girl.

27
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.804
on her way to
becoming a veterinarian.

28
00:01:34.887 --> 00:01:37.556
Now. baby.
We're just a phone call away.

29
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.810
five hour car ride away.
50 minute plane ride away.

30
00:01:40.893 --> 00:01:43.062
You know we're there
for you. anything you need.

31
00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:44.230
You have our numbers.

32
00:01:44.313 --> 00:01:46.941
Yes. I practically
have them memorized.

33
00:01:47.024 --> 00:01:48.484
Good.

34
00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:50.277
But. don't call after 10:00 pm
cause we'll probably be asleep.

35
00:01:51.403 --> 00:01:52.780
That was a joke.
You know that was a joke. right?

36
00:01:52.863 --> 00:01:55.199
I love
your jokes. daddy.

37
00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:56.867
Do you like your bed?

38
00:01:56.951 --> 00:01:58.244
Yeah.

39
00:01:58.327 --> 00:01:59.995
We should have gotten
her a better mattress.

40
00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:01.580
How come we didn't
think of that?

41
00:02:01.664 --> 00:02:03.374
Know what this room
needs. is a Medeco lock.

42
00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:05.000
- Medeco makes a very sturdy lock.
- Yeah.

43
00:02:05.084 --> 00:02:07.211
And what's with this co-ed dorm?
Why are we doing that?

44
00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:09.255
She's in a co-ed dorm.
whose idea was that?

45
00:02:09.338 --> 00:02:10.089
That's wrong.

46
00:02:10.172 --> 00:02:12.758
I love you guys so much.

47
00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:15.219
Thank you.

48
00:02:17.263 --> 00:02:18.889

Which part?

65
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.403
All of it. I promise.

66
00:04:02.243 --> 00:04:03.494
Can I help you?

67
00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:05.412
Sorry. guys.
Gotta hook it up.

68
00:04:05.496 --> 00:04:06.121
Shit!

69
00:04:06.205 --> 00:04:07.081
What. now?

70
00:04:07.164 --> 00:04:09.875
Hey. man. I'm just
doing my job. all right?

71
00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.003
We just dropped our daughter
off at college. and we've been

72
00:04:13.087 --> 00:04:14.296
really. really busy.

73
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.965
I'll send a payment
in a few days.

74
00:04:16.048 --> 00:04:18.342
Look. it's not me.
it's Volvo. okay?

75
00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:20.761
They don't fuck around when
it comes to a lease. Okay?

76
00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:22.888
I just need a little more time.

77
00:04:22.972 --> 00:04:24.598
There is a back story. here.

78
00:04:24.682 --> 00:04:27.059
Always is. brother.
Always is.

79
00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:28.852
Would you like to hear it?

80
00:04:34.775 --> 00:04:36.068
All right. shoot.

81
00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:37.987
I started a medical company.

82
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.365
Put everything we had into it.
making a medical innovation

83
00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:43.284
that's been adding
years to people's lives.

84
00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:46.662
We rolled the dice hard.
but we believed in it.

85
00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:47.955
Then there was a problem.

86
00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:50.416
Small. but enough for
some news stories.

87
00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:52.668
They started calling us
"controversial." which is the

88
00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:53.794
toughest word in our business.

89
00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:56.714
and it's been bad
dominoes ever since.

90
00:04:56.797 --> 00:04:59.133
Now. our daughter doesn't
know at all about this.

91
00:04:59.216 --> 00:05:01.593
We've been holding it together
until she went off to college.

92
00:05:01.677 --> 00:05:03.512
and now we're gonna
hold it together

93
00:05:03.595 --> 00:05:05.514
until we get back
on our feet.

94
00:05:06.557 --> 00:05:07.474
What do you make?

95
00:05:07.558 --> 00:05:08.851
What. salary?

96
00:05:08.934 --> 00:05:10.269
Product.

97
00:05:10.352 --> 00:05:13.147
Artificial heart valves designed
for transfemoral placement.

98
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.981
which means...

99
00:05:14.064 --> 00:05:16.233
Dual leg artery. I know.

100
00:05:16.317 --> 00:05:18.027
You know what I used to
do before this repo shit?

101
00:05:19.153 --> 00:05:19.820
Paramedic.

102
00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:21.030
Oh!

103
00:05:21.113 --> 00:05:22.990
Yeah. People used to
be glad to see me show up.

104
00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:25.284
Yesterday. I had to
take three child seats

105
00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:26.910
out of the back of a Lexus.

106
00:05:26.994 --> 00:05:29.079
lay em out on their lawn.
like I was setting up

107
00:05:29.163 --> 00:05:32.041
for some goddamn baby
Lollapalooza concert.

108
00:05:32.124 --> 00:05:34.251
The Wiggles or some shit.

109
00:05:34.335 --> 00:05:35.461
- Remember them?
- No.

110
00:05:35.544 --> 00:05:37.379
Fuckin' Yum Yum Fruit Salad.

111
00:05:37.463 --> 00:05:40.049
I got kids.
It was sad.

112
00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:44.178
Shit. Okay. look.

113
00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:45.846
I'll tell em you weren't here.

114
00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:48.265
But the most I can get
you is days. not weeks.

115
00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:49.683
All right?

116
00:05:49.767 --> 00:05:52.895
So. if I were you. I'd find a
way to put some loot in my suit.

117
00:05:52.978 --> 00:05:55.481
Sell some crack.
or I'll be back!

118
00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:02.821
Thank you.

119
00:06:02.905 --> 00:06:04.198
Thank you.

120
00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:05.949
Finally a break.

121
00:06:14.458 --> 00:06:17.461
What about the.
uh. lamp in the den?

122
00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:19.296
It's broken.

123
00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.591
So. we sell it as-is.
or we fix it?

124
00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:25.302
We don't fix things.
Frank. we only ruin them.

125
00:06:25.386 --> 00:06:28.055
Hi guys.
Having a yard sale?

126
00:06:28.138 --> 00:06:31.600
Uh. no. Bert. Our living
room puked all over our yard.

127
00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:32.559
What?

128
00:06:32.643 --> 00:06:33.811
Bye.

129
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:35.896
Oh. look. Frank.

130
00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:40.192
A two thousand dollar Breville
Oracle espresso machine.

131
00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:42.569
And we just had to have it.

132
00:06:42.653 --> 00:06:47.157
But we never even took
it out of the damn box.

133
00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:49.243
Just be happy that the
thing is still in the box.

134
00:06:49.326 --> 00:06:52.329
it's worth two thousand dollars.
one eighth of that is a.

135
00:06:52.413 --> 00:06:53.414
it's a car payment.

136
00:06:53.497 --> 00:06:55.082
Why did we get all this stuff?

137
00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:59.420
Stuff. stuff. stuff everywhere.
and I can't even afford to get

138
00:06:59.503 --> 00:07:03.048
my roots done or
get a bikini wax.

139
00:07:03.132 --> 00:07:05.175
Hey. guys.
You're having a yard sale?

140
00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:06.844
Hi. Jason.

141
00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:09.513
No. Jason. our house
got hit by a tidal wave.

142
00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:11.723
Just ours.
It's a freak of nature.

143
00:07:11.807 --> 00:07:13.851
Heh. well I'm glad it was yours.

144
00:07:13.934 --> 00:07:16.311
Cause. salt water. it's like
kryptonite for the wheelchair.

145
00:07:16.395 --> 00:07:18.272
Jason. are you making
a handicap joke?

146
00:07:18.355 --> 00:07:20.357
I'm sorry. I thought...

147
00:07:20.441 --> 00:07:21.567
Cause...

148
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.194
I'm the one in the...
Uh. Rachel called me.

149
00:07:24.278 --> 00:07:25.487
It sounds like she
made it off fine.

150
00:07:25.571 --> 00:07:27.531
So. the two of you were trying
to make the long distance

151
00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:29.450
thing work? The odds
are against it. Jason.

152
00:07:29.533 --> 00:07:32.119
and she's ambitious
and you live at home.

153
00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:33.328
Frank...

154
00:07:33.412 --> 00:07:34.246
Yes?

155
00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:36.665
Don't pay any attention
to him. Jason.

156
00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:38.542
He's been drinking.

157
00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:40.294
Well. I'd better be
off to work. so...

158
00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:42.921
Hey Jason. do you wear
your Staples uniform under your

159
00:07:43.005 --> 00:07:45.048
clothes like Superman. or do
you go home and change at your

160
00:07:45.132 --> 00:07:47.301
mom's. where you
live. with your mom?

161
00:07:55.476 --> 00:07:57.186
Can't understand
the whispered Spanish.

162
00:07:57.269 --> 00:07:59.730
Mr. Teagarten. I'd really
like to get along with you.

163
00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:01.732
even if Rachel and I
are eventually just friends.

164
00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:04.985
nothing more. 'cause I think
you guys are amazing people.

165
00:08:05.068 --> 00:08:06.320
Thank you. Jason.

166
00:08:06.403 --> 00:08:07.988
Have a nice day.

167
00:08:08.864 --> 00:08:10.240
Enjoy the ride.

168
00:08:10.324 --> 00:08:11.366
Ow.

169
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:13.911
Ah. cause of the wheelchair.
That's...

170
00:08:14.953 --> 00:08:16.413
have a nice one.

171
00:08:20.292 --> 00:08:22.669
Nigel. how's it going
over there in London. huh?

172
00:08:22.753 --> 00:08:24.671
Are they still
driving backwards?

173
00:08:24.755 --> 00:08:26.006
What are you talking about?

174
00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:28.926
You know what I mean.

175
00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:33.514
You know. sideways.
the cars. the street?

176
00:08:33.597 --> 00:08:34.765
Have you been drinking?

177
00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:36.350
Oh. that's hilarious.

178
00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:37.434
Seriously.

179
00:08:38.894 --> 00:08:40.771
Listen to me. I am gonna
be travelling for a while.

180
00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:43.440
all right? I'm gonna be gone to
Nepal. I'll be gone for about

181
00:08:43.524 --> 00:08:44.983
four months.
I'll be off the grid.

182
00:08:45.067 --> 00:08:46.443
Oh. that's weird.
Hey. listen. Nigel.

183
00:08:46.527 --> 00:08:48.153
while I have you on
the phone. I think I need

184
00:08:48.237 --> 00:08:51.156
to ask you for more
money to watch the house.

185
00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.783
Cause I'm over there
like three days a week.

186
00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:54.326
What are you talking about?

187
00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:56.286
It's not that hard
to watch my house.

188
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:57.496
I live right next door to you.

189
00:08:57.579 --> 00:09:00.123
I can get the kid down the
street to do it for free.

190
00:09:00.207 --> 00:09:03.043
just so he can go in
and watch cable. Jesus.

191
00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:04.795
What did he say
about more money?

192
00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:07.130
I don't think he's into it.

193
00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:09.883
I'm going to Nigel's
for a minute.

194
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:39.913
No.

195
00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:45.877
Hello. this is Frank.

196
00:09:46.503 --> 00:09:48.213
Oh. hi. Uh...

197
00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:50.382
Yes. I am going to pay you soon.

198
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.385
No. I don't know when.
but your credit card is very

199
00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:54.803
important to me. so I...

200
00:09:55.721 --> 00:09:57.306
Yes. I know that. but...

201
00:09:58.557 --> 00:10:00.183
Well. I do want to work with
you. so how about this?

202
00:10:00.267 --> 00:10:02.185
I'll send you the credit card.
and you just shove it up

203
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:04.354
your fucking ass.
Does that work?

204
00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:14.448
Yes.

205
00:10:15.157 --> 00:10:16.783
Yes. Yes.

206
00:10:20.495 --> 00:10:21.747
Absolutely not.

207
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:23.290
It's a Chateau Latour.

208
00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:25.042
It's worth 800 dollars.

209
00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:26.918
Have you lost your mind?

210
00:10:27.002 --> 00:10:27.794
Wait a minute.

211
00:10:27.878 --> 00:10:30.339
Since when did
you start smoking?

212
00:10:30.422 --> 00:10:31.673
Just now.

213
00:10:31.757 --> 00:10:33.216
Ha. Great timing.

214
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.010
Just when we can't afford it.

215
00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:37.262
Nigel has hundreds
of bottles of wine.

216
00:10:37.346 --> 00:10:38.388
He doesn't need more wine.

217
00:10:38.472 --> 00:10:40.182
He needs a punch in the
face. but not more wine.

218
00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:41.808
Would you please
have some decency?

219
00:10:41.892 --> 00:10:44.645
You're supposed to be
looking after his property.

220
00:10:44.728 --> 00:10:46.813
not parting it out
like an old Chevy.

221
00:10:46.897 --> 00:10:47.397
What?

222
00:10:47.481 --> 00:10:48.649
What's next?

223
00:10:48.732 --> 00:10:51.818
You gonna put an ad on
Craigslist and rent it out?

224
00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.655
Rent out his house?

225
00:10:54.738 --> 00:10:56.823
Rent out Nigel's house?

226
00:10:56.907 --> 00:10:58.325
On Craigslist?

227
00:10:58.909 --> 00:11:00.243
That's insane.

228
00:11:00.327 --> 00:11:01.912
Stop changing the subject.

229
00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:04.915
Put that bottle of wine back.

230
00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:06.208
Right now.

231
00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:08.293
Shame on you. Frank.

232
00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:15.425
♪ "Hurdy gurdy. hurdy gurdy.
hurdy gurdy gurdy" he sang ♪

233
00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:18.804
♪ Here comes the Roly Poly Man ♪

234
00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:21.473
♪ He's singing songs of love ♪

235
00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:24.810
♪ "Roly poly. roly poly.
roly poly poly" he sang ♪

236
00:11:24.893 --> 00:11:26.687
I love this album.

237
00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:28.939
Are they still called albums?

238
00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:31.024
Albummmmmms....

239
00:11:32.651 --> 00:11:35.237
See dee dee
dee dee dee...

240
00:11:36.071 --> 00:11:37.531
See dee dee dee dee...

241
00:11:40.283 --> 00:11:42.035
You know the Filipinos?

242
00:11:42.119 --> 00:11:43.495
Bob and Teresa?

243
00:11:43.578 --> 00:11:45.205
From the Philippines.

244
00:11:45.288 --> 00:11:48.625
They used to strap coca tree
bark to their bodies before

245
00:11:48.709 --> 00:11:49.835
they went to battle.

246
00:11:49.918 --> 00:11:54.005
The cocaine would leech
into their bloodstream.

247
00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:58.385
and get them amped up to help
them overcome the fear of war.

248
00:11:58.468 --> 00:12:00.762
Frank. we're at war.

249
00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:04.141
I don't think we can get our
hands on that kind of bark.

250
00:12:04.224 --> 00:12:06.059
We ran out of vodka.

251
00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:10.063
I wonder what Rachel will
listen to in college.

252
00:12:10.147 --> 00:12:14.609
What music will transport
her back to her youth.

253
00:12:14.693 --> 00:12:16.945
back to a time when her whole
life was in front of her.

254
00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:19.531
I don't know.

255
00:12:20.532 --> 00:12:22.492
I only know I'm sad
about that vodka.

256
00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:27.038
Fuck it.

257
00:12:28.165 --> 00:12:29.666
La Tour baby!

258
00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:34.463
Whatever happens probably will.

259
00:12:35.964 --> 00:12:37.632
Let's finish it inside.

260
00:12:37.716 --> 00:12:38.383
Yeah.

261
00:12:38.884 --> 00:12:39.593
Yeah.

262
00:12:40.218 --> 00:12:42.596
Starts getting
better tomorrow...

263
00:12:43.805 --> 00:12:48.685
When I'm stuck with a
day that's grey. and lonely.

264
00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:52.147
I just stick out my
chin and grin...

265
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.440
Oh.

266
00:12:53.523 --> 00:12:54.775
And saaaaay...

267
00:12:54.858 --> 00:12:59.404
The sun will come out tomorrow

268
00:13:06.745 --> 00:13:12.751
You're only a daaaay
aaaawaaaaaay!

269
00:13:16.338 --> 00:13:18.507
Haha. you
fell on your ass. baby.

270
00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:49.579
Excuse me.

271
00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:51.915
Hi.

272
00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:55.252
What can you tell
me about this house?

273
00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:56.753
I'm sorry?

274
00:13:56.837 --> 00:14:00.257
There was a rental ad for
this house on Craigslist.

275
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.676
but no one's
answering the doorbell.

276
00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:04.845
An ad on Craigslist?

277
00:14:04.928 --> 00:14:05.804
Yeah.

278
00:14:07.222 --> 00:14:08.682
For Nigel's house?

279
00:14:08.765 --> 00:14:11.476
No. somebody named Frank?

280
00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:14.771
The ad's gone. it was
flagged for profanity.

281
00:14:14.855 --> 00:14:16.898
Okay. wait.
Back the fuck up.

282
00:14:16.982 --> 00:14:18.525
Let's start over.
What?

283
00:14:18.608 --> 00:14:21.945
Well. there was an ad. "For
rent. big beautiful fucking

284
00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:26.032
house furnished up the ass."
Obviously. I was intrigued.

285
00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:30.871
Are you okay?

286
00:14:32.581 --> 00:14:34.749
Not even in the ballpark.

287
00:14:46.303 --> 00:14:48.346
Four dollars?

288
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:50.640
Four dollars for a zucchini.

289
00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:54.603
And these people won't even
grease the wheels of their

290
00:14:54.686 --> 00:14:56.271
shopping cart.

291
00:14:57.731 --> 00:14:58.773
Fuckers.

292
00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:09.075
Nancy?

293
00:15:09.159 --> 00:15:10.660
Are you okay?

294
00:15:10.744 --> 00:15:12.329
Oh. you.

295
00:15:12.412 --> 00:15:14.247
Heidi. hi.

296
00:15:14.331 --> 00:15:19.544
I'm fine. it's just that I saw a
spider. and I tried to get it.

297
00:15:19.628 --> 00:15:21.504
My foot got stuck.

298
00:15:21.588 --> 00:15:24.799
Um. are those box
wines in your cart?

299
00:15:28.762 --> 00:15:30.680
No. I'm juicing.

300
00:15:30.764 --> 00:15:32.349
How are Chip and the kids?

301
00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:35.435
Oh. Chip pulled some strings
and got Carter into Yale.

302
00:15:35.518 --> 00:15:37.938
He won't light up the world but
he won't blow it up. either.

303
00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:39.314
Ah.

304
00:15:39.397 --> 00:15:42.150
Oh. totally off-subject. did
you hear about Lisa Chang?

305
00:15:42.233 --> 00:15:43.276
No. Lisa?

306
00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.862
She and Andrew split up.
younger woman. yadda yadda.

307
00:15:45.946 --> 00:15:46.905
you know the drill.

308
00:15:46.988 --> 00:15:51.076
But. Lisa is working
at Macy's now.

309
00:15:51.826 --> 00:15:52.869
At the perfume counter.

310
00:15:52.953 --> 00:15:53.745
Oh my god.

311
00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:55.497
Oh my god.

312
00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.917
She's waving those little
smelly cards in people's faces.

313
00:16:00.752 --> 00:16:02.712
She gained ten pounds.

314
00:16:02.796 --> 00:16:04.631
And she's about to gain more.

315
00:16:04.714 --> 00:16:06.967
Because you have to
be rich to be skinny.

316
00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:11.012
All the cheap foods are
the ones that pork you up.

317
00:16:11.096 --> 00:16:13.765
The sugars. the carbs.
the corn syrup.

318
00:16:13.848 --> 00:16:18.103
I do not understand why the more
preservatives and chemicals

319
00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:21.106
they put in the food.
the cheaper it is.

320
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:25.360
And the food that just comes out
of the earth. it's so expensive.

321
00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:26.444
Bastards!

322
00:16:26.528 --> 00:16:30.448
It's those hippies.
They see they're so going

323
00:16:30.532 --> 00:16:34.744
"hey Dude. look
at this zucchini. man.

324
00:16:34.828 --> 00:16:38.581
It's so beautiful. a
gift from mother earth.

325
00:16:38.665 --> 00:16:40.583
How much should
we charge for it?"

326
00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:45.213
"Uh. I dunno. $4.20?
Heheheh."

327
00:16:55.515 --> 00:16:57.767
Okay. bye. Bye.
Nice to see you.

328
00:16:58.393 --> 00:16:59.853
Bye. Bye.

329
00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:00.854
Bye.

330
00:17:03.565 --> 00:17:05.358
Oh my god. oh my god.

331
00:17:06.818 --> 00:17:08.069
Frank.

332
00:17:08.153 --> 00:17:10.572
I think I'm having an
anxiety attack. and...

333
00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:15.035
Wait. what?

334
00:17:32.135 --> 00:17:33.428
Is this a joke?

335
00:17:35.889 --> 00:17:37.098
But when?

336
00:17:37.182 --> 00:17:38.266
The cheque?

337
00:17:38.349 --> 00:17:39.559
No. the ad.

338
00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:42.270
It must have been last night
when we were drinking.

339
00:17:42.353 --> 00:17:44.147
I thought you did it.
It was all your idea.

340
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.690
My idea?

341
00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:50.779
Frank. I said it to make a
point about how we don't do

342
00:17:50.862 --> 00:17:52.155
anything stupid like that.

343
00:17:52.238 --> 00:17:53.448
Don't you remember?

344
00:17:53.531 --> 00:17:56.367
I don't remember us polishing
off that Chateau Latour.

345
00:17:56.451 --> 00:17:57.535
but we did that too. right?

346
00:17:57.619 --> 00:17:58.912
I remember that.

347
00:17:58.995 --> 00:18:01.956
I remember pulling the cork. it
made that pop sound like the

348
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.418
crunch sound Eve probably
made when she bit the apple.

349
00:18:06.377 --> 00:18:07.587
Baby.

350
00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:09.881
It's six months in advance.
his name is Carl. and for

351
00:18:09.964 --> 00:18:12.467
what it's worth. I think
he was sent from God.

352
00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:17.430
Frank. do you understand
what this means?

353
00:18:18.556 --> 00:18:21.601
It means an entire year
of Rachel's tuition.

354
00:18:22.143 --> 00:18:24.270
Thank you Jesus!

355
00:18:26.981 --> 00:18:29.984
Does this mean we're
gonna celebrate?

356
00:18:31.402 --> 00:18:32.612
Heck yes.

357
00:18:32.695 --> 00:18:34.072
But...

358
00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:35.949
I gotta do something first.

359
00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:37.909
I'll be right back.

360
00:18:56.219 --> 00:18:57.804
Hi. Frank.

361
00:18:57.887 --> 00:19:00.974
Hey. Is that
Dave Brubeck on the stereo?

362
00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:02.058
No.

363
00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:03.476
Too bad. I love Brubeck.

364
00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:06.354
Especially back when Stan
Getz was on tenor sax.

365
00:19:06.437 --> 00:19:09.274
Getz did the soundtrack for
Micky One. which is my favourite

366
00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:12.861
Warren Beatty film.
I wanna say '65. '66.

367
00:19:12.944 --> 00:19:15.155
Warren Beatty was
a handsome boy.

368
00:19:15.238 --> 00:19:17.240
Got all the lady women.
Right?

369
00:19:17.323 --> 00:19:18.867
But you know. Micky
One's not for everyone.

370
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:20.034
You have to be patient.

371
00:19:20.118 --> 00:19:22.412
Unlike Star Wars. that
really trucks along.

372
00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:24.038
Right?
Same with Dances with Wolves.

373
00:19:24.122 --> 00:19:25.790
Kevin Costner. he
was definitely...

374
00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:30.420
Carl. that was bizarre. and
I didn't follow any of it.

375
00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:31.713
Is everything okay?

376
00:19:31.796 --> 00:19:33.173
Oh. it's...

377
00:19:33.256 --> 00:19:34.716
I love the house.

378
00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:36.926
Ha. I'm being rude.
This is my good buddy Joe.

379
00:19:38.428 --> 00:19:41.848
Well. less of a buddy
and more of a parole officer.

380
00:19:43.057 --> 00:19:44.350
I beg your pardon?

381
00:19:44.434 --> 00:19:48.646
Frank. uh. as a new neighbour.
I'm "legally required"

382
00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:52.066
to tell you that I'm a
registered sex offender.

383
00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:52.984
Come again?

384
00:19:53.067 --> 00:19:55.403
Wow. really?

385
00:19:55.486 --> 00:19:56.529
Really what?

386
00:19:56.613 --> 00:19:58.448
I was. I was kidding.
You said "come again"

387
00:19:58.531 --> 00:20:00.950
and I'm a sex offender.
It was a joke.

388
00:20:01.034 --> 00:20:03.119
Carl's a class 3 offender.

389
00:20:03.203 --> 00:20:07.123
He has to notify any resident
within a designated area.

390
00:20:07.207 --> 00:20:08.958
So we'll be going
house to house.

391
00:20:09.042 --> 00:20:10.752
It's kind of like trick or
treating. except we don't get

392
00:20:10.835 --> 00:20:14.339
candy. we tell people
I'm a pedophile.

393
00:20:14.422 --> 00:20:16.674
I'm sorry. I'm having
trouble with my ears.

394
00:20:16.758 --> 00:20:20.845
There's a really loud sound to
them. like a. like a roaring

395
00:20:20.929 --> 00:20:23.264
crashing ocean. so...

396
00:20:23.348 --> 00:20:24.974
What the fuck did you just say?

397
00:20:25.058 --> 00:20:28.436
Baby. tell little Frank that
I'm here. that I'm ready...

398
00:20:28.519 --> 00:20:29.646
Baby. get away from the door.

399
00:20:32.899 --> 00:20:34.150
Wow. Frank.

400
00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:36.152
You really did well.

401
00:20:37.695 --> 00:20:39.989
I did not see that coming.

402
00:20:40.073 --> 00:20:42.492
Good.
I'm glad you didn't plan this.

403
00:20:42.575 --> 00:20:45.995
Gotta burn down the
house to cook the pig.

404
00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:47.038
What?

405
00:20:47.121 --> 00:20:49.082
I'm saying "I did
not see that coming."

406
00:20:49.165 --> 00:20:52.001
Oh. look. They're
going to the Templemans.

407
00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:53.586
Nice people. the Templemans.

408
00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.380
Their lawn is always so green.

409
00:20:55.463 --> 00:20:57.674
I've always wondered
what they use.

410
00:20:57.757 --> 00:21:00.969
Maybe you can call Carl.
You know. the fucking

411
00:21:01.052 --> 00:21:03.721
fucking sex offender.
and ask him to ask them.

412
00:21:05.056 --> 00:21:08.685
Probably
magnesium sulphate.

413
00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:11.854
You realize we're
going to jail. right?

414
00:21:11.938 --> 00:21:14.274
No. Nigel will
never press charges.

415
00:21:14.357 --> 00:21:16.192
I've pulled his fat out
of the fire too many times.

416
00:21:16.276 --> 00:21:18.528
Like last month. his smoke
detector was beeping.

417
00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:20.613
I changed the 9-volt.
didn't even charge him.

418
00:21:20.697 --> 00:21:23.825
Snap out of it. motherfucker.
We're going to jail.

419
00:21:25.368 --> 00:21:27.245
Don't forget your prescriptions
and anything else you might

420
00:21:27.328 --> 00:21:28.621
need for the next few weeks.

421
00:21:28.705 --> 00:21:30.206
Frank. help me.

422
00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.583
Hold this bag.
Hold this bag.

423
00:21:35.044 --> 00:21:37.380
Do you really need all these
panties and such. hun?

424
00:21:37.463 --> 00:21:39.257
No. I'm gonna hide
them in the attic.

425
00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:42.552
I don't want him going
all over my lingerie.

426
00:21:42.635 --> 00:21:44.137
The word is "cumming."
Honey. Cumming.

427
00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.179
I don't give a damn.

428
00:21:45.263 --> 00:21:48.599
I do not want his DNA
on my private things.

429
00:21:48.683 --> 00:21:51.060
Baby. we really don't
know what he did.

430
00:21:51.144 --> 00:21:53.688
Then you should hide
your panties. too.

431
00:22:02.905 --> 00:22:03.740
Hi.

432
00:22:05.533 --> 00:22:09.620
Look. I know I should have
said something. but it's not

433
00:22:09.704 --> 00:22:12.749
like I told you I wasn't
a registered offender.

434
00:22:12.832 --> 00:22:14.375
Oh my god. he just said that.

435
00:22:14.459 --> 00:22:16.336
I saw his lips move
and everything.

436
00:22:16.419 --> 00:22:19.797
Carl. Part of me would like to
punch you in the face right now.

437
00:22:19.881 --> 00:22:21.883
but another part of me would
like to kick you in the balls.

438
00:22:21.966 --> 00:22:23.217
Which do you prefer?

439
00:22:23.301 --> 00:22:26.512
Uh. thanks.
I normally don't get a choice.

440
00:22:26.596 --> 00:22:29.599
But I. I don't know
anything about your house.

441
00:22:29.682 --> 00:22:32.477
How do I know your house
is as nice as this house?

442
00:22:33.102 --> 00:22:34.937
Our house is gorgeous.

443
00:22:35.021 --> 00:22:37.273
Carl. you don't have a choice.

444
00:22:37.357 --> 00:22:41.027
Our house could be a shack
cantilevered over hell's septic

445
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:42.528
tank. and it wouldn't matter.

446
00:22:42.612 --> 00:22:44.447
You either move into our house.
or you're back on the street

447
00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:46.324
because you cannot stay here.

448
00:22:47.367 --> 00:22:51.120
I guess I could
just get my 25 grand back

449
00:22:51.204 --> 00:22:52.705
and find another place.

450
00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.005
You know what?

451
00:23:01.089 --> 00:23:02.465
Fine with me.

452
00:23:02.548 --> 00:23:05.343
Because I'm not even sure
that I want you in my house.

453
00:23:05.426 --> 00:23:09.013
sleeping in our bed.
inside our sheets.

454
00:23:09.097 --> 00:23:11.682
where I sleep
naked all the time.

455
00:23:11.766 --> 00:23:12.683
Ugh.

456
00:23:12.767 --> 00:23:14.811
And what if he finds
our home videos?

457
00:23:14.894 --> 00:23:17.271
Didn't I tell you
not to film that?

458
00:23:17.355 --> 00:23:19.357
Maybe I can make this work.

459
00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.818
Let me run something by you.

460
00:23:21.901 --> 00:23:24.654
The Swedish Duxiana mattress.

461
00:23:24.737 --> 00:23:27.657
I haven't been able to
sleep one night in it.

462
00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:31.577
I'm not really interested in
mattresses normally. but this is

463
00:23:31.661 --> 00:23:36.624
my one time for this mattress.
and I'm not even a mattress guy.

464
00:23:36.707 --> 00:23:38.000
- You want the mattress. Carl?
- Yeah.

465
00:23:38.084 --> 00:23:39.585
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

466
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:40.962
You're not getting the mattress.

467
00:23:41.045 --> 00:23:42.713
Have you ever had
your head examined?

468
00:23:42.797 --> 00:23:44.424
What's in there. pop tarts?

469
00:23:44.507 --> 00:23:48.511
"I'm not even a mattress guy."
Jesus H Christ. Carl. you are

470
00:23:48.594 --> 00:23:49.679
not getting the
fucking mattress.

471
00:23:50.888 --> 00:23:53.015
Why are we going
through the backyard?

472
00:23:53.099 --> 00:23:54.767
Why is the sky blue?

473
00:23:54.851 --> 00:23:58.646
Cause sunlight is refracted by
dust particles in the air and

474
00:23:58.729 --> 00:24:01.399
blue is the dominant
colour of the spectrum?

475
00:24:01.482 --> 00:24:05.236
Did you learn that in the 5th
grade. or from a 5th grader?

476
00:24:05.319 --> 00:24:06.612
Ouch.

477
00:24:09.073 --> 00:24:11.492
Baby. only you would
think of turning Nigel's pool

478
00:24:11.576 --> 00:24:13.870
into our own private drive-in.

479
00:24:13.953 --> 00:24:16.080
Maybe I'm losing my mind.

480
00:24:16.164 --> 00:24:17.874
Awww.

481
00:24:17.957 --> 00:24:19.375
Look at her.

482
00:24:19.459 --> 00:24:22.253
That was Rachel's
5th grade play.

483
00:24:22.336 --> 00:24:24.839
She was so good.
Rachel was the best thing in it.

484
00:24:24.922 --> 00:24:27.175
I'm being objective.
I mean. compared to Rachel.

485
00:24:27.258 --> 00:24:29.177
the rest of these
kids were all laughable.

486
00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:32.930
Their screechy voices
so hard on the ears.

487
00:24:34.348 --> 00:24:36.434
Ah. and there it is.

488
00:24:36.517 --> 00:24:40.813
Janice's grand
unforgettable party.

489
00:24:40.897 --> 00:24:44.484
Your sister only threw that
party to prove how rich she is.

490
00:24:44.567 --> 00:24:48.404
You know. I was in a
98 cents store today.

491
00:24:48.488 --> 00:24:49.947
I bet you anything

492
00:24:50.031 --> 00:24:53.284
that Janice would never
set foot in one of those.

493
00:24:53.367 --> 00:24:55.870
That's only because
she married Dan. not because

494
00:24:55.953 --> 00:24:58.539
she's any smarter than you.

495
00:24:58.623 --> 00:25:01.125
Do you remember when
we went together?

496
00:25:01.209 --> 00:25:04.212
You were craving Baby Ruths.

497
00:25:04.295 --> 00:25:06.255
I just had to have
that Baby Ruth.

498
00:25:06.339 --> 00:25:09.759
On a hunch we bought that
pregnancy test and eight months

499
00:25:09.842 --> 00:25:14.263
later. along came
our little Rachel.

500
00:25:14.764 --> 00:25:16.265
To Baby Ruths.

501
00:25:16.349 --> 00:25:18.017
To Baby Ruths.

502
00:25:23.022 --> 00:25:25.233
Hello?

503
00:25:25.942 --> 00:25:27.735
Mr. Teagarten's not at home.

504
00:25:27.818 --> 00:25:29.278
I'm sorry?

505
00:25:29.362 --> 00:25:30.780
He owes you money?

506
00:25:32.114 --> 00:25:35.618
Well. I'm his butler. not his
accountant. you fucking arse.

507
00:25:39.539 --> 00:25:41.165
That was Mastercard.

508
00:25:41.249 --> 00:25:44.335
Frank. why don't we
sell our funeral plots?

509
00:25:44.418 --> 00:25:48.005
We can get what. 2.000
dollars at least. right?

510
00:25:48.089 --> 00:25:49.799
Shit. baby. I'm sorry.

511
00:25:49.882 --> 00:25:51.717
School wanted a dorm deposit.

512
00:25:52.552 --> 00:25:53.803
Well. how lovely.

513
00:25:53.886 --> 00:25:56.722
I actually have to pee
really badly right now.

514
00:25:56.806 --> 00:25:58.933
and I would normally do it
right here in the pool.

515
00:25:59.016 --> 00:26:01.143
but I don't want to make our
problems any worse.

516
00:26:09.402 --> 00:26:10.945
Is that you. Carl?

517
00:26:13.864 --> 00:26:15.575
What's up. pervert?

518
00:26:15.658 --> 00:26:17.201
What the
hell is going on here?

519
00:26:17.285 --> 00:26:20.246
Nancy. Nancy. call 911!

520
00:26:20.329 --> 00:26:21.664
Who you talking to?

521
00:26:21.747 --> 00:26:23.249
Nobody.

522
00:26:23.332 --> 00:26:24.542
There's nobody else here.

523
00:26:31.424 --> 00:26:32.800
Oh my god.

524
00:26:34.927 --> 00:26:38.306
Run. run. ISIS has come!

525
00:26:39.265 --> 00:26:40.933
I am neutral!

526
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:43.269
Put me down! Put me down!

527
00:27:05.458 --> 00:27:07.752
You know what this bitch was
doing when I grabbed her?

528
00:27:07.835 --> 00:27:10.671
Staring at a little
girl in a leotard.

529
00:27:10.755 --> 00:27:12.423
That was my daughter.

530
00:27:12.506 --> 00:27:14.759
The law won't protect our
community from deviants

531
00:27:14.842 --> 00:27:15.968
like you.

532
00:27:16.052 --> 00:27:17.219
We will.

533
00:27:19.013 --> 00:27:23.267
So if we see you anywhere
near 112 Blue Jay...

534
00:27:32.485 --> 00:27:34.737
We just escaped death.

535
00:27:35.946 --> 00:27:37.990
They thought you were Carl.
because Carl gave out

536
00:27:38.074 --> 00:27:39.200
Nigel's address.

537
00:27:39.283 --> 00:27:41.077
They thought
I was Carl because he gave

538
00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.244
out Nigel's address.

539
00:27:42.328 --> 00:27:44.664
That's what I just said.
why are you screaming?

540
00:27:44.747 --> 00:27:46.123
The gunshots.

541
00:27:46.207 --> 00:27:47.792
My ears are. you know.

542
00:27:49.543 --> 00:27:52.213
You know how you know when
your life is out of control?

543
00:27:53.631 --> 00:27:55.716
When there's a ringing in your
ears and you don't know if it's

544
00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:59.595
a creditor calling or a
kidnapper has fired a shotgun

545
00:27:59.679 --> 00:28:02.390
six inches from your head.

546
00:28:06.018 --> 00:28:08.479
Is that
Spanx over tights?

547
00:28:08.562 --> 00:28:11.065
Yes. I'm double Spanking.

548
00:28:11.148 --> 00:28:13.734
Do you have to scream
it to the world?

549
00:28:15.152 --> 00:28:17.279
Cause right about now. I'd like
to have a pair of really tight

550
00:28:17.363 --> 00:28:20.449
Spanx around my fucking neck.

551
00:28:21.617 --> 00:28:23.494
No. Janice
would never understand.

552
00:28:23.577 --> 00:28:25.287
But she's your sister.

553
00:28:25.371 --> 00:28:27.373
She will ask too many questions.

554
00:28:27.998 --> 00:28:29.792
Our car broke down.

555
00:28:29.875 --> 00:28:31.085
Right.

556
00:28:31.168 --> 00:28:34.672
And I'm barefoot because
we have the Flintstone's car.

557
00:28:34.755 --> 00:28:37.133
and I peddled it like Wilma.

558
00:28:40.219 --> 00:28:41.971
What's your guess
on his net worth?

559
00:28:42.054 --> 00:28:43.347
I'd say at least
a hundred million.

560
00:28:43.431 --> 00:28:45.141
It's as high as two
hundred million.

561
00:28:45.224 --> 00:28:46.183
No. that's too high.

562
00:28:46.267 --> 00:28:48.018
At least a hundred million.

563
00:28:48.102 --> 00:28:49.812
He's definitely well fed.

564
00:28:49.895 --> 00:28:50.938
Please. let's go.

565
00:28:51.021 --> 00:28:53.482
She'll never buy our bullshit.

566
00:28:53.566 --> 00:28:56.694
And you can't tell her. or
anybody else for that matter.

567
00:28:56.777 --> 00:28:59.447
That's how this falling
from grace thing works.

568
00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:02.700
People find out. they look
away. they avert their eyes.

569
00:29:03.159 --> 00:29:04.827
Especially our friends.

570
00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:07.163
Are they really
our friends. then?

571
00:29:07.246 --> 00:29:09.415
Nancy. I'm too tired to have a
deep conversation right now.

572
00:29:11.876 --> 00:29:13.043
But no.

573
00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:16.714
No. Frank. Why are
you forcing me to do this?

574
00:29:16.797 --> 00:29:19.175
I cannot take this
shit right now.

575
00:29:19.258 --> 00:29:21.260
I'm going to get
an anxiety attack.

576
00:29:21.343 --> 00:29:22.678
Not Betty.

577
00:29:22.762 --> 00:29:25.681
Okay. I understand you didn't
want to stay at Janice's.

578
00:29:25.765 --> 00:29:27.349
but now you don't want to stay
at this sister's house?

579
00:29:27.433 --> 00:29:28.768
but we have nowhere to go.

580
00:29:28.851 --> 00:29:31.103
Carl's in our house. we can't go
back to Nigel's because those

581
00:29:31.187 --> 00:29:33.939
psychos said they'd kill us.
we don't have any credit cards.

582
00:29:34.023 --> 00:29:36.150
you're barefoot.
and I feel like hell.

583
00:29:36.233 --> 00:29:37.401
Of course you do.

584
00:29:37.485 --> 00:29:40.362
Cause we're almost there.
That is hell.

585
00:29:40.446 --> 00:29:43.199
It's like we're in Kansas.
and we're about to get sucked

586
00:29:43.282 --> 00:29:47.453
into a tornado and
drop into an inferno

587
00:29:47.536 --> 00:29:50.331
where Oompa-Loompa's on
speed are the gatekeepers.

588
00:29:50.414 --> 00:29:53.000
Baby. I'm going to need
some time to sort through all

589
00:29:53.083 --> 00:29:56.170
those analogies.
Besides. it's not that bad.

590
00:29:56.253 --> 00:29:57.713
Just smile a lot.

591
00:29:57.797 --> 00:29:59.465
See? Smile.

592
00:29:59.548 --> 00:30:00.508
Like this.

593
00:30:00.591 --> 00:30:02.301
Let's see how long that lasts.

594
00:30:07.765 --> 00:30:09.099
Hi Tristan.

595
00:30:09.183 --> 00:30:09.892
Hi Tristan.

596
00:30:09.975 --> 00:30:11.477
Why is she barefoot?

597
00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:14.230
Uh. Tai Chi.
It's very relaxing.

598
00:30:14.313 --> 00:30:15.564
Uh. can we come in?

599
00:30:15.648 --> 00:30:17.608
I guess you could come in.

600
00:30:18.651 --> 00:30:21.278
Dad. Uncle Frank and
Aunt Nancy are here.

601
00:30:21.362 --> 00:30:23.155
That's a really
cool walkie-talkie.

602
00:30:23.239 --> 00:30:26.158
Yeah. well not to me.
My fucking dad won't spring

603
00:30:26.242 --> 00:30:28.994
for the Ace 10s.
which are way more badass.

604
00:30:29.078 --> 00:30:30.496
Hmm.

605
00:30:30.579 --> 00:30:32.623
Navy Seals use Ace 10s. they
also use cool martial arts like

606
00:30:32.706 --> 00:30:34.333
Krav Maga and cool
shit like that.

607
00:30:34.416 --> 00:30:37.127
Tai Chi's for homos. but
you probably knew that.

608
00:30:37.211 --> 00:30:38.838
Smile. Frank.

609
00:30:39.463 --> 00:30:41.006
Oh. hi Trey.

610
00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:42.132
I wish.

611
00:30:42.216 --> 00:30:45.594
My walkie talkie is
dead as a used dick.

612
00:30:45.678 --> 00:30:47.096
You have any 9-volt batteries?

613
00:30:47.179 --> 00:30:48.597
- Me?
- Can I search you?

614
00:30:48.681 --> 00:30:49.682
- What?
- Nothing.

615
00:30:49.765 --> 00:30:52.434
Dad. for god sakes. what
is this. a Becket play?

616
00:30:52.518 --> 00:30:53.894
When did this turn
into Waiting for Godot?

617
00:30:53.978 --> 00:30:56.438
That is quite a reference
for a young lad.

618
00:30:56.522 --> 00:30:58.524
Yeah.
I'm Vladimir and he's Estrago.

619
00:30:58.607 --> 00:31:00.484
- It's Estragon.
- Bullshit.

620
00:31:00.568 --> 00:31:03.612
Dad. chop-chop.
the small talk is getting a

621
00:31:03.696 --> 00:31:04.864
little thin out here.

622
00:31:04.947 --> 00:31:06.824
All right. I'm coming.
I'm coming. don't get

623
00:31:06.907 --> 00:31:07.867
your panties in a wad.

624
00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:09.952
All hail Lord Douchington.

625
00:31:10.035 --> 00:31:11.036
Hi. Bob.

626
00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:12.955
Hey. you made it.
How's the trip?

627
00:31:13.038 --> 00:31:14.373
Found everything okay?

628
00:31:14.456 --> 00:31:15.165
Douche.

629
00:31:15.249 --> 00:31:17.543
Hey. that's TV for a week. pal.

630
00:31:17.626 --> 00:31:19.044
Señor Douche.

631
00:31:19.128 --> 00:31:20.212
Yup.

632
00:31:21.422 --> 00:31:22.506
God.

633
00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:23.841
Delightful.

634
00:31:23.924 --> 00:31:25.843
Hey. so Nance. how
come you're barefoot?

635
00:31:25.926 --> 00:31:27.511
You ain't going
hippie on me. are ya?

636
00:31:27.595 --> 00:31:28.596
Yeah.

637
00:31:28.679 --> 00:31:31.724
I'm like Wilma Flintstone.

638
00:31:32.516 --> 00:31:34.018
Fred was the one who drove.

639
00:31:34.101 --> 00:31:35.644
Wilma just rode shotgun.

640
00:31:35.728 --> 00:31:37.313
She drove sometimes.

641
00:31:37.396 --> 00:31:40.024
So. uh. they're termite
tending your house? What?

642
00:31:40.107 --> 00:31:42.318
Well yeah. we tried to sleep
in the den. but there were all

643
00:31:42.401 --> 00:31:45.321
these fumes. and then it was
like we were back in the 60s.

644
00:31:46.697 --> 00:31:48.657
Well. I wouldn't know.
I'm way younger than you are.

645
00:31:48.741 --> 00:31:50.492
Hey. but I do know
the tending game.

646
00:31:50.576 --> 00:31:52.161
We got spiders.

647
00:31:52.244 --> 00:31:54.997
When those spider eggs pop.
those little spiders come out.

648
00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:56.582
they start biting
everything like crazy.

649
00:31:56.665 --> 00:31:58.417
Smile. Frank.

650
00:31:58.500 --> 00:31:59.418
Heh.

651
00:31:59.501 --> 00:32:01.879
Oh. yeah.
Do I sound defensive?

652
00:32:01.962 --> 00:32:02.838
No.

653
00:32:02.922 --> 00:32:03.923
Is Betty coming down?

654
00:32:04.006 --> 00:32:05.507
I was telling
Frank on the phone.

655
00:32:05.591 --> 00:32:07.301
she's laid up with diarrhea.

656
00:32:07.384 --> 00:32:09.720
Accidentally made a
sandwich out of cat food.

657
00:32:09.803 --> 00:32:12.097
Well. don't worry about us.
We had dinner already.

658
00:32:12.181 --> 00:32:13.933
I think I'm gonna go
see how she's doing.

659
00:32:14.016 --> 00:32:14.850
Hey. hey. hey.

660
00:32:14.934 --> 00:32:16.894
You don't wanna go
up there right now.

661
00:32:16.977 --> 00:32:20.522
She's on the throne. blowing
brown. if you catch my drift.

662
00:32:20.606 --> 00:32:21.815
I caught it. yup.

663
00:32:21.899 --> 00:32:23.734
Hey. but like I said.
you two are welcome to

664
00:32:23.817 --> 00:32:24.860
bunk in the twins' room.

665
00:32:24.944 --> 00:32:27.696
Our room? Why not your room?

666
00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:30.741
Because you two can sleep
on the couch tonight. Over.

667
00:32:31.158 --> 00:32:33.994
Ever hear of a Motel 6? Over.

668
00:32:34.078 --> 00:32:35.204
Hilarious.

669
00:32:35.287 --> 00:32:37.414
I'm just gonna
show you to the room.

670
00:32:37.498 --> 00:32:39.041
hopefully we won't get lost.

671
00:32:39.124 --> 00:32:41.043
Let's do
this every month.

672
00:32:47.007 --> 00:32:48.133
Sorry. fellas.

673
00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:50.094
Sorry enough to go away?

674
00:32:50.177 --> 00:32:51.136
Wow.

675
00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:52.680
The bed is small.

676
00:32:52.763 --> 00:32:55.808
If you're gonna do any stuff on
it. just wash the sheets after.

677
00:32:57.059 --> 00:32:58.227
Will do.

678
00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:00.020
It's gross.

679
00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:02.314
Are we talking about
the same thing?

680
00:33:03.023 --> 00:33:03.816
I'm serious.

681
00:33:03.899 --> 00:33:04.692
I'm sure you are.

682
00:33:04.775 --> 00:33:05.609
Do we have a problem?

683
00:33:05.693 --> 00:33:07.987
I don't think so.
Are we done now?

684
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:10.072
Yeah. I think we're done.

685
00:33:10.155 --> 00:33:12.950
Did you know that you can
hack into baby monitors?

686
00:33:13.033 --> 00:33:16.412
We're teaching our neighbour's
baby how to say the N-word.

687
00:33:17.621 --> 00:33:19.206
Nancy. would you join
me outside for a second?

688
00:33:19.289 --> 00:33:20.290
Yeah.

689
00:33:20.374 --> 00:33:23.002
You understand now what
I was talking about?

690
00:33:23.085 --> 00:33:24.837
Except the Oompa-Loompa's
are not on speed.

691
00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:27.381
they are on angel dust.

692
00:33:27.464 --> 00:33:29.466
How did we get so
lucky with Rachel?

693
00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:32.052
We communicated with her
directly. not through some

694
00:33:32.136 --> 00:33:35.014
CB radio. Let's start
there and reverse engineer it.

695
00:33:37.558 --> 00:33:40.853
I was thinking. we rented
Nigel's house to Carl but we had

696
00:33:40.936 --> 00:33:43.022
to move him over to our house.
which means that Nigel's house

697
00:33:43.105 --> 00:33:44.064
is still empty.

698
00:33:44.148 --> 00:33:46.108
I say we rent Nigel's
house again...

699
00:33:46.191 --> 00:33:47.359
Frank!

700
00:33:47.443 --> 00:33:48.944
Only this time to somebody
who isn't a sex offender.

701
00:33:49.028 --> 00:33:53.073
Or. why don't we just handcuff
ourselves and walk straight into

702
00:33:53.157 --> 00:33:55.117
the police station. Frank?

703
00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.453
This place is filled
with spider webs.

704
00:33:57.536 --> 00:33:58.912
Well. as you can see.
they don't clean.

705
00:33:58.996 --> 00:34:01.331
The original Craigslist
ad is still on my phone.

706
00:34:01.415 --> 00:34:03.208
I say we post it again.

707
00:34:03.292 --> 00:34:05.294
Are you not listening
to me. Frank?

708
00:34:05.711 --> 00:34:09.131
Absolutely no fucking way.

709
00:34:09.214 --> 00:34:10.799
This is where we draw the line.

710
00:34:10.883 --> 00:34:13.010
Baby. I don't know what's on
the other side of that line.

711
00:34:13.093 --> 00:34:14.887
but I do know what's on
this side of that line.

712
00:34:14.970 --> 00:34:16.180
and it is bleak.

713
00:34:16.263 --> 00:34:18.140
Okay. here's the
original Craigslist ad.

714
00:34:18.223 --> 00:34:19.308
- Don't you dare.
- We delete some of

715
00:34:19.391 --> 00:34:20.976
the bad words. I think
you were drunk at the time.

716
00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:22.811
I was drunk at the time?

717
00:34:22.895 --> 00:34:26.190
And it is done.

718
00:34:26.273 --> 00:34:28.859
You just posted it again?
Aaaah. Frank!

719
00:34:28.942 --> 00:34:30.319
You just smoked a spider!

720
00:34:33.947 --> 00:34:35.491
Give me the Heimlich!

721
00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:43.957
What the hell's going on?
You woke up my baby.

722
00:34:44.041 --> 00:34:46.085
Frank. I get it.
you smoked a spider.

723
00:34:46.168 --> 00:34:47.878
But can you keep it down?

724
00:34:48.712 --> 00:34:50.672
Hit me in the back.

725
00:34:52.132 --> 00:34:54.051
Not with the shovel!

726
00:34:55.594 --> 00:34:58.639
Natalie. tell your kids
to stay off my baby monitor.

727
00:34:58.722 --> 00:35:00.891
It's your fault for
having a baby monitor.

728
00:35:00.974 --> 00:35:02.351
It's an attractive nuisance.

729
00:35:02.434 --> 00:35:04.186
There it is.

730
00:35:06.605 --> 00:35:09.358
Frank. are you okay?

731
00:35:09.441 --> 00:35:11.276
Do you want another cigarette?

732
00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.737
Are you all right baby?

733
00:35:39.138 --> 00:35:40.597
Dad. come quick.

734
00:35:40.681 --> 00:35:42.766
Why is Uncle Frank
doing this to me?

735
00:35:45.644 --> 00:35:46.645
Oh my god.

736
00:35:46.728 --> 00:35:47.896
Yes?

737
00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:49.064
Frank!

738
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:51.316
My god.

739
00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.360
What is going on?

740
00:35:53.443 --> 00:35:55.737
Nancy. are you naked?

741
00:35:55.821 --> 00:35:58.323
No. I'm not naked.
It's a shirt.

742
00:35:58.407 --> 00:36:00.367
Tristan. what are those?

743
00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:03.162
It's Aunt Nancy's Spanx.
Uncle Frank made me wear them.

744
00:36:03.245 --> 00:36:04.538
Now stop this.

745
00:36:04.621 --> 00:36:06.456
Frank. how could
you. he's just a boy.

746
00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:07.916
I'm so scared right now.

747
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.501
Oh shit.

748
00:36:09.585 --> 00:36:10.544
Jesus Christ.

749
00:36:10.627 --> 00:36:12.087
Betty...

750
00:36:12.171 --> 00:36:14.506
She just stuck
her tongue out at me.

751
00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:17.384
Frank. downstairs. now.

752
00:36:22.181 --> 00:36:23.599
Who are you?

753
00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:29.771
You know what. Frank?

754
00:36:29.855 --> 00:36:32.774
It's not pleasant to be
mistaken for a sex offender.

755
00:36:32.858 --> 00:36:37.070
and molesting your nephew
in less than 24 hours.

756
00:36:38.155 --> 00:36:40.908
But right now. I feel
sorry for my sister.

757
00:36:40.991 --> 00:36:43.452
I am actually really
worried for her.

758
00:36:43.535 --> 00:36:45.454
As you should be.

759
00:36:45.537 --> 00:36:48.248
Pretty soon. some court
appointed therapist

760
00:36:48.332 --> 00:36:50.167
is going to be white
knuckling with those two kids.

761
00:36:51.585 --> 00:36:53.212
I see that your sister
calmed down enough to lend

762
00:36:53.295 --> 00:36:54.421
you her wig. huh?

763
00:36:54.504 --> 00:36:57.507
Uh. yeah. I don't know whose
wig is it. in that house.

764
00:36:57.591 --> 00:36:59.468
Well. it helps us hide
from the kidnappers.

765
00:37:00.886 --> 00:37:02.971
Hey. are you Wayne. the
guy that answered the ad?

766
00:37:03.055 --> 00:37:04.223
- Yeah. yeah.
- I'm Frank.

767
00:37:04.306 --> 00:37:06.350
What are you two. in the
witness protection program?

768
00:37:06.433 --> 00:37:08.477
No. we were just sunning
ourselves in the backyard.

769
00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:09.853
- Is that your truck. Wayne?
- Yeah.

770
00:37:09.937 --> 00:37:11.230
Oh that's fantastic.
Step inside and we'll

771
00:37:11.313 --> 00:37:12.773
just take a look at the house.
Okay?

772
00:37:16.235 --> 00:37:18.654
The ad said the house
comes furnished?

773
00:37:18.737 --> 00:37:21.198
Uh. yep. It only needs
a mattress. Long story.

774
00:37:21.281 --> 00:37:22.699
The previous tenant took it.

775
00:37:22.783 --> 00:37:23.700
Short story.

776
00:37:23.784 --> 00:37:26.203
Okay then.
I wrote you a cheque.

777
00:37:26.995 --> 00:37:27.996
You uh. that's it?

778
00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.331
You don't want to
have a look around?

779
00:37:29.414 --> 00:37:30.415
It's not to be an asshole.

780
00:37:30.499 --> 00:37:31.708
You want to rent
the place or not?

781
00:37:31.792 --> 00:37:33.335
I mean. I got shit
tons of stuff to do.

782
00:37:33.418 --> 00:37:35.462
Yes. uh. no. uh. sure.

783
00:37:35.545 --> 00:37:37.756
It's just that normally
there's a process.

784
00:37:37.839 --> 00:37:39.633
We learned the hard
way to ask questions.

785
00:37:39.716 --> 00:37:42.052
Did you hear that?

786
00:37:43.136 --> 00:37:44.388
What's that?

787
00:37:45.681 --> 00:37:46.723
Good lord.

788
00:37:46.807 --> 00:37:48.058
Oh. there's
something on my face.

789
00:37:48.141 --> 00:37:49.977
No. don't touch your face!
Don't panic.

790
00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:52.104
You're covered in spiders.

791
00:37:52.187 --> 00:37:53.605
Jesus. baby don't move.

792
00:37:55.899 --> 00:37:57.693
Agh. they're
crawling on my body.

793
00:37:57.776 --> 00:37:59.945
Get them. get them!

794
00:38:00.946 --> 00:38:03.407
They're biting me.
they're biting me!

795
00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:06.576
They're
biting me. get them out!

796
00:38:12.499 --> 00:38:14.710
Get them out!

797
00:38:34.229 --> 00:38:36.064
Oh Frank.
what have I done?

798
00:38:36.148 --> 00:38:37.733
Tell my Rachel I love her.

799
00:38:37.816 --> 00:38:39.443
You're not going to die.
you're not going to die.

800
00:38:39.526 --> 00:38:40.986
You hear me? Woah! Woah!

801
00:38:41.069 --> 00:38:43.405
Stop scratching yourself. don't
antagonize it. for god sake's.

802
00:38:43.989 --> 00:38:45.407
Nancy! You're gonna be fine.

803
00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:47.159
the doctors will
give you an ointment.

804
00:38:47.242 --> 00:38:48.702
Hold on. hold on.

805
00:38:48.785 --> 00:38:50.454
God I hate spiders. don't you?

806
00:38:50.537 --> 00:38:52.706
- Wait. there's another one.
- Woah!

807
00:39:06.803 --> 00:39:09.264
♪ Kickin' up a storm.
black clouds of grey ♪

808
00:39:09.348 --> 00:39:12.059

812
00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:33.705
Oh.

813
00:39:34.373 --> 00:39:35.832
Tyler. how are you?

814
00:39:35.916 --> 00:39:38.543
Uh. Frank. how are you?

815
00:39:38.627 --> 00:39:41.046
I'm on the right side of the
grass my man. what's the happs?

816
00:39:42.255 --> 00:39:45.008
No offence Frank. but
how did you get in here?

817
00:39:45.092 --> 00:39:47.010
This is a restricted
access garage.

818
00:39:48.095 --> 00:39:50.013
Well. I still have
my Jensen parking pass.

819
00:39:50.097 --> 00:39:53.058
and I have an interview
today up on 16 with Gretina.

820
00:39:54.476 --> 00:39:57.062
Gretina's not on
16 anymore. Frank.

821
00:39:57.145 --> 00:39:58.605
What floor are they on?

822
00:39:58.688 --> 00:40:00.107
They moved to Seattle.

823
00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:04.319
Well. don't remind me.
cause I'm dying for a Starbucks.

824
00:40:04.403 --> 00:40:06.321
but the meeting is on Skype.

825
00:40:06.405 --> 00:40:08.990
I'm gonna Skype to uh. Seattle.

826
00:40:12.536 --> 00:40:13.495
Don't. don't.

827
00:40:13.578 --> 00:40:15.372
Don't Tyler. don't
give me that look.

828
00:40:15.455 --> 00:40:17.165
I know that look. Please.

829
00:40:18.625 --> 00:40:19.876
Everything's fine.

830
00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.211
Everything with us is okay.

831
00:40:21.294 --> 00:40:24.172
Honey. you remember Tyler
Rector from Jensen Med?

832
00:40:24.256 --> 00:40:25.298
Baby. can you hear me?

833
00:40:34.099 --> 00:40:35.308
How can I help?

834
00:40:37.102 --> 00:40:40.605
So that's the long and
short but the silver lining is

835
00:40:40.689 --> 00:40:42.190
that. at least for now.

836
00:40:42.274 --> 00:40:44.151
we don't have to worry
about Rachel's college.

837
00:40:44.234 --> 00:40:45.402
But. we're homeless.

838
00:40:47.279 --> 00:40:49.614
Wow. that's quite a story.

839
00:40:50.615 --> 00:40:53.076
So all this started
with one mistake?

840
00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:56.037
With a bunch of
smaller ones shooting off it.

841
00:40:56.121 --> 00:41:00.917
Kind of like when a spider egg
pops. and all these little

842
00:41:01.001 --> 00:41:05.130
spiders come and
bite you in the ass.

843
00:41:05.213 --> 00:41:07.090
Are you gonna eat that?

844
00:41:07.174 --> 00:41:08.842
No. please.

845
00:41:09.426 --> 00:41:10.760
Thank you.

846
00:41:11.678 --> 00:41:13.013
Listen. guys.

847
00:41:13.096 --> 00:41:14.514
I know someone.

848
00:41:14.598 --> 00:41:16.933
His name's Randall.
Let me give him a call.

849
00:41:17.017 --> 00:41:18.768
Frank. he might have
something for you.

850
00:41:18.852 --> 00:41:19.936
It'd be a start.

851
00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:21.730
Tyler.
that would be great.

852
00:41:21.813 --> 00:41:24.107
And we also still
have Wayne's cheque.

853
00:41:24.191 --> 00:41:25.984
We can always cash that.

854
00:41:27.319 --> 00:41:30.405
Frank. if you cash that cheque.
then it's no longer one mistake.

855
00:41:30.489 --> 00:41:31.656
It becomes a pattern.

856
00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:34.451
Exactly. That's what
I've been trying to tell him.

857
00:41:34.534 --> 00:41:37.787
But Tyler. desperation
is a bitch.

858
00:41:37.871 --> 00:41:42.459
Thank you so much for everything
that you've done to help us.

859
00:41:42.542 --> 00:41:45.629
So. you guys have your
work cut out for you.

860
00:41:45.712 --> 00:41:49.382
Just remember. grass can
grow through concrete.

861
00:41:50.634 --> 00:41:54.054
Did he say your ass can
grow through concrete?

862
00:41:54.137 --> 00:41:58.725
No. no. the phrase is "grass
can grow through concrete."

863
00:41:59.809 --> 00:42:01.561
Could I give you that. please?
Do you mind if I...?

864
00:42:01.645 --> 00:42:03.021
Thank you.

865
00:42:07.859 --> 00:42:10.529
Nancy. you're
gonna be all right.

866
00:42:14.991 --> 00:42:16.451
Don't panic. Nancy.

867
00:42:16.993 --> 00:42:18.745
You're gonna take a hot bath.

868
00:42:18.828 --> 00:42:20.956
You're gonna get fresh clothes.

869
00:42:21.039 --> 00:42:22.832
you're gonna do your
hair and makeup.

870
00:42:22.916 --> 00:42:25.252
In three minutes
you'll be yourself.

871
00:42:25.335 --> 00:42:27.462
What the fuck?

872
00:42:28.838 --> 00:42:30.674
Thank you for taking
this lunch. I know you're busy.

873
00:42:30.757 --> 00:42:31.967
No. of course.

874
00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:33.552
Tyler called me. told me a
little about your background.

875
00:42:33.635 --> 00:42:36.054
Well. I hope he exaggerated
in all the right places.

876
00:42:38.056 --> 00:42:39.724
That's my wife. I'm sorry.

877
00:42:40.267 --> 00:42:41.017
Hi honey.

878
00:42:41.101 --> 00:42:42.936
Dammit Frank. We're cursed.

879
00:42:43.019 --> 00:42:45.981
I am at Nigel's house.
and everything is gone.

880
00:42:46.064 --> 00:42:50.151
They took my purse. my
phone. Nigel's furniture.

881
00:42:50.235 --> 00:42:54.322
That guy Wayne was all
wrong. and we knew it.

882
00:42:54.406 --> 00:42:57.492
Now fuck it. they
stole everything!

883
00:42:57.576 --> 00:42:59.244
I see. uh.

884
00:42:59.327 --> 00:43:00.704
That's uh. yes.

885
00:43:00.787 --> 00:43:02.122
That's great.

886
00:43:02.205 --> 00:43:04.833
Thanks for calling. and
we'll celebrate later. okay?

887
00:43:04.916 --> 00:43:06.459
I'll see you. Bye.

888
00:43:06.543 --> 00:43:07.794
No. no. don't hang up.

889
00:43:07.877 --> 00:43:08.712
You okay?

890
00:43:08.795 --> 00:43:10.005
Uh. yeah. it's all good.

891
00:43:10.088 --> 00:43:13.925
My wife just got an article
published in Omni magazine.

892
00:43:14.759 --> 00:43:15.802
Great.

893
00:43:15.885 --> 00:43:17.429
Omni must be feeling good too.

894
00:43:17.512 --> 00:43:18.972
Be back up and running.

895
00:43:19.055 --> 00:43:20.098
I'm sorry?

896
00:43:20.181 --> 00:43:22.517
They folded about
two decades ago.

897
00:43:23.727 --> 00:43:25.145
Wow.

898
00:43:25.228 --> 00:43:28.148
Man plans and God
laughs. right? I mean-

899
00:43:28.231 --> 00:43:30.150
Everybody's got a
plan until you get...

900
00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:32.277
punched in the face.

901
00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:33.445
Jesus.

902
00:43:33.528 --> 00:43:34.779
Sorry. Frank.

903
00:43:35.614 --> 00:43:36.740
I'm sorry.

904
00:43:36.823 --> 00:43:37.699
No. no.

905
00:43:37.782 --> 00:43:39.284
I'm Frank. you're...

906
00:43:39.367 --> 00:43:41.369
- Randall.
- Randall. Right.

907
00:43:41.453 --> 00:43:43.538
I'm sorry.
Can we start over again?

908
00:43:44.122 --> 00:43:44.998
Sure.

909
00:43:46.833 --> 00:43:48.543
Hi. I'm Frank.

910
00:44:10.148 --> 00:44:11.483
For God sake!

911
00:44:11.566 --> 00:44:14.277
Carl!
I just need to get a few things.

912
00:44:49.062 --> 00:44:51.648
You come in my house. you
come in my house. you like that?

913
00:44:51.731 --> 00:44:52.816
You like that?

914
00:44:58.571 --> 00:45:02.325
I'm sorry. my gosh.
did you change your hair?

915
00:45:06.246 --> 00:45:08.081
I'm so sorry about
the pepper spray.

916
00:45:08.164 --> 00:45:09.582
I thought you were an intruder.

917
00:45:09.666 --> 00:45:11.209
Not that you look
like an intruder.

918
00:45:11.292 --> 00:45:13.878
I'm against profiling.
not that I necessarily would

919
00:45:13.962 --> 00:45:17.966
want sushi from a redhead.
I prefer an Asian chap.

920
00:45:18.049 --> 00:45:19.551
if you know what I mean.

921
00:45:19.634 --> 00:45:21.177
Why didn't my key work?

922
00:45:21.261 --> 00:45:23.138
I had the locks changed.

923
00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:24.806
You what?

924
00:45:24.889 --> 00:45:26.474
You can't change our locks.

925
00:45:26.558 --> 00:45:27.517
Carl?

926
00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:28.977
Oh. um...

927
00:45:29.728 --> 00:45:31.438
This is not your house. Carl.

928
00:45:31.521 --> 00:45:32.647
I. look...

929
00:45:32.731 --> 00:45:34.649
What are you wearing?

930
00:45:34.733 --> 00:45:36.234
What. this?

931
00:45:36.317 --> 00:45:39.070
You know what. I uh.
I got you guys a key.

932
00:45:39.154 --> 00:45:40.488
Um.

933
00:45:40.572 --> 00:45:42.240
Uh. there you go.

934
00:45:43.199 --> 00:45:44.117
What the?

935
00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:46.327
The wood's so you
don't misplace it.

936
00:45:46.411 --> 00:45:47.495
Carl.

937
00:45:48.246 --> 00:45:50.123
This is not a gas station.

938
00:45:50.206 --> 00:45:51.833
What is wrong with you?

939
00:45:52.751 --> 00:45:53.877
Whatever.

940
00:45:54.753 --> 00:45:57.046
I just need to get some
stuff from my closet.

941
00:45:58.214 --> 00:45:59.966
Your closet?

942
00:46:01.885 --> 00:46:03.178
Wha- what is this?

943
00:46:03.261 --> 00:46:05.305
I mean. what is this?

944
00:46:05.388 --> 00:46:06.848
Where's my stuff?

945
00:46:06.931 --> 00:46:08.349
What have you done
with my closet?

946
00:46:08.433 --> 00:46:10.226
I made it into a panic room.

947
00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:12.103
You can't do that. Carl.

948
00:46:12.187 --> 00:46:14.147
Remember. this is
not your house.

949
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:15.982
Did you ever see the
Jody Foster movie?

950
00:46:16.065 --> 00:46:17.567
And please put a shirt on.

951
00:46:18.443 --> 00:46:21.070
I. I've been really
nervous lately.

952
00:46:21.154 --> 00:46:24.324
People have been ringing the
doorbell all day asking about

953
00:46:24.407 --> 00:46:27.869
the yard sale and then I was
really scared when I saw the

954
00:46:27.952 --> 00:46:31.206
video on the internet of
you and Frank being kidnapped

955
00:46:31.289 --> 00:46:32.540
with a shotgun.

956
00:46:32.624 --> 00:46:33.958
There's a video on the internet?

957
00:46:34.042 --> 00:46:35.668
Nancy. you're the
best part of it.

958
00:46:35.752 --> 00:46:37.128
You came across really real.

959
00:46:37.212 --> 00:46:40.006
I was real. you dumb fuck.

960
00:46:41.174 --> 00:46:44.093
Uh. we're locked in.

961
00:46:45.303 --> 00:46:48.556
Did you say
"catalytic converters?"

962
00:46:50.183 --> 00:46:52.644
Frank. I know it's not a
sexy business. but catalytic

963
00:46:52.727 --> 00:46:55.063
converters are like
mini treasure chests.

964
00:46:55.146 --> 00:46:58.191
We snip them off the cars.
smelt em down and sell off the

965
00:46:58.274 --> 00:46:59.400
expensive metals.

966
00:46:59.484 --> 00:47:01.653
Palladium. rhodium. platinum.

967
00:47:02.779 --> 00:47:04.447
Most cases. cat cons
are worth more than the

968
00:47:04.531 --> 00:47:05.573
junk cars themselves.

969
00:47:07.075 --> 00:47:10.161
You mean I would crawl
underneath the car.

970
00:47:10.245 --> 00:47:13.456
and snip them?
That's the job?

971
00:47:15.375 --> 00:47:17.210
Listen. Frank.
I'm gonna be honest.

972
00:47:18.545 --> 00:47:21.047
I could use the extra hand but
I don't need the extra hand.

973
00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:24.425
Tyler told me you needed a
leg up. this is what I got.

974
00:47:25.552 --> 00:47:27.637
I'm really glad you're here.

975
00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:29.222
Me gusta.

976
00:47:30.265 --> 00:47:33.643
Ugh. aw jeez. That was...

977
00:47:33.726 --> 00:47:35.103
Ugh.

978
00:47:35.186 --> 00:47:36.855
That was--

979
00:47:36.938 --> 00:47:41.067
If you ever try anything like
that again. I am gonna kick your

980
00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:44.696
ass up and down this panic
room like an air hockey puck.

981
00:47:45.697 --> 00:47:47.031
Oh. okay.

982
00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:56.040
Thank you virgin. for making
Carl such a breathtaking moron.

983
00:47:58.167 --> 00:48:01.588
You forgot about the
attic hatch. Einstein.

984
00:48:03.423 --> 00:48:07.802
Hey. I'm sorry about
the misunderstanding.

985
00:48:07.886 --> 00:48:10.221
I guess I misread your signals.

986
00:48:10.305 --> 00:48:11.639
What signals?

987
00:48:11.723 --> 00:48:14.267
God. your legs are so strong.

988
00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:16.811
I guess it's from
running track. huh?

989
00:48:16.895 --> 00:48:18.146
I saw your medals.

990
00:48:18.229 --> 00:48:19.647
How did you find my medals?

991
00:48:19.731 --> 00:48:21.107
They were hidden in the garage.

992
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:22.692
Yeah. way back there.

993
00:48:22.775 --> 00:48:24.569
And you should really
hide them better.

994
00:48:24.652 --> 00:48:26.905
You were the fastest on
the team. but what I don't

995
00:48:26.988 --> 00:48:30.158
understand is. in the relay.
why did you run fourth?

996
00:48:30.241 --> 00:48:32.160
Shouldn't the fastest
runner go first?

997
00:48:32.243 --> 00:48:33.870
Maybe you weren't the fastest.

998
00:48:33.953 --> 00:48:35.872
I was the fastest.

999
00:48:35.955 --> 00:48:37.457
That's not the way it works.

1000
00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:39.626
When you're the fastest. you...

1001
00:48:39.709 --> 00:48:42.128
Oh. what am I doing.
why am I talking to you?

1002
00:48:42.211 --> 00:48:43.671
Please help me out.

1003
00:48:44.797 --> 00:48:46.799
The bottom line
is. I'm interested.

1004
00:48:46.883 --> 00:48:51.888
And I. I work hard. and I take
any job I do very seriously.

1005
00:48:52.889 --> 00:48:53.848
Okay.

1006
00:48:53.932 --> 00:48:56.017
Here comes the cold water.

1007
00:48:57.393 --> 00:48:59.646
We can only offer you about a
third of what you were making.

1008
00:48:59.729 --> 00:49:01.731
Tyler told me your
ballpark salary.

1009
00:49:01.814 --> 00:49:03.942
You did very. very well.

1010
00:49:04.025 --> 00:49:05.068
A third?

1011
00:49:06.277 --> 00:49:07.695
Listen. I wish it was different.

1012
00:49:07.779 --> 00:49:10.198
I used to make high-end five
figures over at Brent Talbot.

1013
00:49:10.281 --> 00:49:11.616
then the fan hit the shit.

1014
00:49:11.699 --> 00:49:14.535
Now. I got a sales staff of guys
longing for the days

1015
00:49:14.619 --> 00:49:17.830
of Hugo Boss suits and
paychecks with commas in 'em.

1016
00:49:19.082 --> 00:49:20.500
Frank. you think I like
crawling around in the dirt

1017
00:49:20.583 --> 00:49:22.043
snipping smoke sacks?

1018
00:49:23.252 --> 00:49:25.088
Shit. some days I look at one of
those cat cons and think

1019
00:49:25.171 --> 00:49:28.883
"I'll just wrap my lips
around it. take a deep breath.

1020
00:49:28.967 --> 00:49:30.802
go meet some dead relatives."

1021
00:49:30.885 --> 00:49:33.346
How old are you? 65?

1022
00:49:34.472 --> 00:49:35.473
66?

1023
00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:36.975
Anyways.

1024
00:49:37.058 --> 00:49:39.811
Guys your age
gotta adapt or die.

1025
00:49:40.561 --> 00:49:42.647
That's the new America.
Trust me.

1026
00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:44.482
I miss the old one. brother.

1027
00:49:46.359 --> 00:49:47.902
Uh. will you excuse me?

1028
00:49:47.986 --> 00:49:51.739
I'm fairly positive I
need to use the bathroom.

1029
00:49:53.408 --> 00:49:54.784
Get your hands off my ass.

1030
00:49:54.867 --> 00:49:55.743
You said push.

1031
00:49:55.827 --> 00:49:57.662
I said push. not fondle.

1032
00:49:57.745 --> 00:49:58.705
Watch the thumb.

1033
00:49:58.788 --> 00:50:01.082
Do you do squats?

1034
00:50:01.165 --> 00:50:02.709
It feels like you do squats.

1035
00:50:04.544 --> 00:50:06.170
You made it.

1036
00:50:06.254 --> 00:50:07.755
Now. lift me up.

1037
00:50:08.256 --> 00:50:09.799
I get claustrophobic.

1038
00:50:09.882 --> 00:50:11.467
No. no.

1039
00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:14.345
First you have to
tell me what you did.

1040
00:50:14.429 --> 00:50:16.764
And no lies. no bullshit.

1041
00:50:16.848 --> 00:50:19.308
You have to tell me. or
I'll leave you there.

1042
00:50:19.392 --> 00:50:21.227
You'll rot.
And I'll just come

1043
00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:24.272
and sprinkle some lime
just to mask the smell.

1044
00:50:25.314 --> 00:50:26.315
I...

1045
00:50:26.399 --> 00:50:29.652
you might not understand.

1046
00:50:31.529 --> 00:50:32.447
True.

1047
00:50:32.530 --> 00:50:34.574
It's a roll of the dice.

1048
00:50:40.288 --> 00:50:42.415
I was swimming in the ocean.

1049
00:50:42.498 --> 00:50:44.959
I was in the water
for a couple hours.

1050
00:50:45.043 --> 00:50:46.377
I...

1051
00:50:46.461 --> 00:50:50.339
I had to pee.
I took off my shorts.

1052
00:50:50.423 --> 00:50:53.259
then I felt something
brush against my leg.

1053
00:50:53.342 --> 00:50:54.802
I knew it was a shark.

1054
00:50:54.886 --> 00:50:58.765
I knew in that moment. and I
know to this day it was a shark.

1055
00:50:58.848 --> 00:50:59.974
and...

1056
00:51:01.350 --> 00:51:04.854
I started swimming to
shore. trying not to panic.

1057
00:51:06.064 --> 00:51:09.525
I saw that there were
some kids swimming there.

1058
00:51:10.818 --> 00:51:15.364
So I was carrying three of
them. trudging and tripping

1059
00:51:15.448 --> 00:51:16.657
and yelling for help.

1060
00:51:16.741 --> 00:51:19.619
The kids were screaming. I
thought they had seen the shark.

1061
00:51:19.702 --> 00:51:22.288
They hadn't. they. um.

1062
00:51:23.498 --> 00:51:26.918
they were frightened
of me. a naked guy.

1063
00:51:28.669 --> 00:51:30.880
My life...

1064
00:51:30.963 --> 00:51:33.466
got pretty hard after that.

1065
00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:37.345
It's true. isn't it?

1066
00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:40.640
Yeah.

1067
00:51:42.183 --> 00:51:43.559
It is.

1068
00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:49.357
You say all these
crazy stupid things.

1069
00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:53.111
But when you suddenly say
something without bullshit.

1070
00:51:54.195 --> 00:51:56.322
Now I know it's true and good.

1071
00:51:56.405 --> 00:51:59.784
But just in case. I'm gonna
leave you there until after

1072
00:51:59.867 --> 00:52:00.660
I take my shower.

1073
00:52:00.743 --> 00:52:02.870
Oh. you know what.
there's some...

1074
00:52:02.954 --> 00:52:05.790
shampoo in my purse on
the kitchen counter.

1075
00:52:05.873 --> 00:52:08.584
Oh. I refilled your
birth control pills.

1076
00:52:08.668 --> 00:52:10.169
You were running low.

1077
00:52:10.253 --> 00:52:11.712
Ha!

1078
00:52:14.841 --> 00:52:17.760
No. no. no. no... No!

1079
00:52:17.844 --> 00:52:18.928
No! No!

1080
00:52:43.077 --> 00:52:45.163
All you perverts
out there watching.

1081
00:52:45.246 --> 00:52:47.081
this might happen to you.

1082
00:52:49.375 --> 00:52:50.877
You might die!

1083
00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:52.211
What the?

1084
00:52:52.295 --> 00:52:54.255
Holy shit. it's him.
The guy from the video!

1085
00:52:54.338 --> 00:52:55.506
No. this is a mistake.

1086
00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:56.924
Die!

1087
00:52:57.008 --> 00:52:58.551
Dude. you're like the No. 1

1088
00:52:58.634 --> 00:53:00.178
trending pervert on
the internet right now.

1089
00:53:00.261 --> 00:53:02.346
My god. why is this happening?

1090
00:53:18.070 --> 00:53:19.155
Stop the truck. Wayne.

1091
00:53:19.238 --> 00:53:20.448
Shit. you again?

1092
00:53:20.531 --> 00:53:21.908
You have my furniture.

1093
00:53:21.991 --> 00:53:24.660
Oh. it's not yours. that house
wasn't yours. and the furniture

1094
00:53:24.744 --> 00:53:25.995
definitely wasn't yours.

1095
00:53:26.078 --> 00:53:27.830
Pull over. Wayne. I
need that furniture.

1096
00:53:27.914 --> 00:53:29.498
You know what you're gonna need?
You're going to need to

1097
00:53:29.582 --> 00:53:31.792
go to a fucking hospital.
that's what you're gonna need.

1098
00:53:31.876 --> 00:53:33.211
I'm gonna put you
in jail. Wayne.

1099
00:53:33.294 --> 00:53:35.463
Oh. you don't have the
balls to call the cops.

1100
00:53:35.546 --> 00:53:38.007
You suck at this crime stuff.

1101
00:53:38.090 --> 00:53:39.425
You know what I'm gonna do?

1102
00:53:39.508 --> 00:53:40.384
You ain't gonna do shit.

1103
00:53:40.468 --> 00:53:42.345
Wayne. I'm gonna
throw a rock at you.

1104
00:53:42.428 --> 00:53:43.679
I pitched in college.

1105
00:53:43.763 --> 00:53:46.349
You probably caught in college.
Dickhead.

1106
00:53:48.643 --> 00:53:49.727
Oh shit...

1107
00:53:49.810 --> 00:53:52.146
Son of a bitch.

1108
00:53:57.735 --> 00:53:59.111
Holy shit.
are you okay?

1109
00:53:59.195 --> 00:54:01.113
You hit a fucking pedestrian.

1110
00:54:06.786 --> 00:54:07.870
Sorry. Wayne.

1111
00:54:09.372 --> 00:54:11.791
Hey! Hey!

1112
00:54:12.166 --> 00:54:14.335
Get back here. you asshole!

1113
00:54:25.054 --> 00:54:26.889
What fresh hell is this?

1114
00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:29.267
Dios mio!

1115
00:54:29.350 --> 00:54:30.810
No. no. no. I didn't...

1116
00:54:31.310 --> 00:54:33.020
Ohm...

1117
00:54:40.278 --> 00:54:42.446
Ommmm.

1118
00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:50.079
Shit. shit.
Now what?

1119
00:55:03.467 --> 00:55:05.052
- Frank!
- Shit!

1120
00:55:05.136 --> 00:55:06.470
Panic room! Car gone!

1121
00:55:06.554 --> 00:55:07.763
Keep walking. the cops.

1122
00:55:07.847 --> 00:55:09.265
Found Nigel's stuff.
don't look over.

1123
00:55:09.348 --> 00:55:10.766
It's in the back of the truck.
Don't look over.

1124
00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:11.934
Excuse me.

1125
00:55:13.311 --> 00:55:15.688
Hi. Are you
Mr. Bathgate's neighbours?

1126
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:17.565
Yes. officer.

1127
00:55:17.648 --> 00:55:20.109
Yeah. we got a report of
a burglary at his house.

1128
00:55:20.192 --> 00:55:22.820
suspicious activity.
Have you seen anything?

1129
00:55:22.903 --> 00:55:25.531
A burglary?
What. at Nigel's house?

1130
00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:27.867
Good sweet Christ.

1131
00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:30.745
what is happening to our
sweet little neighbourhood?

1132
00:55:30.828 --> 00:55:32.830
Uh. are you okay sir?

1133
00:55:32.913 --> 00:55:34.206
No.

1134
00:55:34.290 --> 00:55:37.752
I'm devastated beyond reason.

1135
00:55:43.049 --> 00:55:44.300
Sweet Christ.

1136
00:55:45.343 --> 00:55:47.178
You know. I wasn't into that.

1137
00:55:47.261 --> 00:55:48.804
Never?

1138
00:55:49.347 --> 00:55:50.639
Not really.

1139
00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:53.351
Not even in a school
play or anything?

1140
00:55:53.434 --> 00:55:54.769
Yeah. I was never into drama.

1141
00:55:54.852 --> 00:55:57.396
I mean. sure. in the third
grade I played a teacup.

1142
00:55:57.480 --> 00:56:00.608
Why all the questions
about acting?

1143
00:56:00.691 --> 00:56:02.693
You think I came across as fake?

1144
00:56:02.777 --> 00:56:04.820
I think there's better acting
every time Larry King says

1145
00:56:04.904 --> 00:56:07.323
- "til death do us part."
- That's very funny.

1146
00:56:07.406 --> 00:56:09.033
You wanna hear something
else that's funny?

1147
00:56:09.116 --> 00:56:11.327
There's a video of us getting
kidnapped on YouTube.

1148
00:56:11.410 --> 00:56:12.703
I know.

1149
00:56:19.919 --> 00:56:22.630
You don't know how many times
I've fantasized about getting

1150
00:56:22.713 --> 00:56:26.258
rid of you for at least two
months. but now that I'm going

1151
00:56:26.342 --> 00:56:30.346
to yail. I'm going to be
devastated without you.

1152
00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:32.598
You're going back to college?

1153
00:56:32.681 --> 00:56:36.394
You know that when I say
"yail" I mean prison.

1154
00:56:42.441 --> 00:56:46.445
Using his mother's house. and by
that I mean his mother's garage.

1155
00:56:47.863 --> 00:56:50.866
I'm sure Jason's home. rubbing
his mother's feet or something.

1156
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:52.618
We know you're in there. Jason.

1157
00:56:57.748 --> 00:56:58.958
Hi.

1158
00:56:59.041 --> 00:57:02.169
Oh. hey. hi Mr. and
Mrs. Teagarten. Is that...

1159
00:57:02.253 --> 00:57:03.671
actually. I wasn't hiding.

1160
00:57:03.754 --> 00:57:04.964
Is everything okay?

1161
00:57:05.047 --> 00:57:06.132
Why wouldn't it be. Jason?

1162
00:57:06.215 --> 00:57:07.883
It's just that you've
never been to my house

1163
00:57:07.967 --> 00:57:10.511
before in like two years
and it's what. 10:00 PM?

1164
00:57:10.594 --> 00:57:13.389
Actually. it isn't
okay. and you can help.

1165
00:57:13.472 --> 00:57:15.182
Rachel's always saying
that you're some kind

1166
00:57:15.266 --> 00:57:16.392
of computer genius.

1167
00:57:16.475 --> 00:57:18.227
She says I'm a computer genius?

1168
00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:19.687
That's very sweet.

1169
00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:21.522
I'm sure it was like a
throwaway. like an aside.

1170
00:57:21.605 --> 00:57:22.731
you know. "he's
a computer genius"

1171
00:57:22.815 --> 00:57:24.108
you know. just like saying...

1172
00:57:24.191 --> 00:57:25.943
Oh. you know what. I bet it's
cause she knows it's on my dream

1173
00:57:26.026 --> 00:57:28.112
boards to become a computer
genius. I bet that's where that

1174
00:57:28.195 --> 00:57:29.905
came from. Did she actually
say that. like in an email.

1175
00:57:29.989 --> 00:57:31.157
or was it in
person to you just...

1176
00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:32.950
Jason!
This isn't about you!

1177
00:57:33.033 --> 00:57:35.619
We need your help with
a video of me and Nancy.

1178
00:57:37.746 --> 00:57:38.706
Okay.

1179
00:57:38.789 --> 00:57:43.085
So you want me to make
a video of you guys?

1180
00:57:44.378 --> 00:57:45.212
No.

1181
00:57:45.296 --> 00:57:46.630
Get your mind
out of the gutter!

1182
00:57:46.714 --> 00:57:48.716
Good lord Jason.
you take the cake.

1183
00:57:51.093 --> 00:57:53.471
It's so much more
fucked up than that.

1184
00:57:53.554 --> 00:57:55.764
Die!!

1185
00:57:55.848 --> 00:57:58.100
Look at this.
This is insane.

1186
00:57:58.184 --> 00:57:59.602
When did this happen?

1187
00:57:59.685 --> 00:58:01.604
It feels like in
another lifetime.

1188
00:58:01.687 --> 00:58:03.481
Yet also like Tuesday.

1189
00:58:03.564 --> 00:58:05.107
Okay. well. we have
to call the police.

1190
00:58:05.191 --> 00:58:06.442
No. no. No police.

1191
00:58:06.525 --> 00:58:08.486
It was a misunderstanding
but everything's okay now.

1192
00:58:08.569 --> 00:58:10.070
It was a hiccup.

1193
00:58:10.154 --> 00:58:12.198
A hiccup?
You being kidnapped?

1194
00:58:12.281 --> 00:58:14.492
A hiccup.
It was a hiccup. A hiccup.

1195
00:58:14.575 --> 00:58:16.827
You don't call 911 every time
you have the hiccups do you. no.

1196
00:58:16.911 --> 00:58:18.329
I mean. maybe you
do. but I don't.

1197
00:58:18.412 --> 00:58:19.747
Listen. Jason.

1198
00:58:19.830 --> 00:58:22.249
We don't want
Rachel to see this.

1199
00:58:22.333 --> 00:58:23.751
She would only worry.

1200
00:58:23.834 --> 00:58:26.545
That's why we must
take this down.

1201
00:58:26.629 --> 00:58:28.422
Yeah. yeah. yeah.
Shouldn't be a problem.

1202
00:58:28.506 --> 00:58:30.216
Although. these guys
should be punished though.

1203
00:58:30.299 --> 00:58:33.052
cause they cannot do that.
Especially to you guys. I mean-

1204
00:58:35.387 --> 00:58:37.056
Oh my god. okay. that's actually
Rachel Skyping me right now.

1205
00:58:37.139 --> 00:58:38.098
We're not here.

1206
00:58:38.182 --> 00:58:39.308
She'll know there's
something wrong.

1207
00:58:39.391 --> 00:58:41.143
We would only be here with
you if we were desperate.

1208
00:58:41.227 --> 00:58:43.938
No. no. I want to see her
little face. even if it's for

1209
00:58:44.021 --> 00:58:47.066
just a second. We can hide.
she won't know we're here.

1210
00:58:47.149 --> 00:58:48.108
please. please. please.

1211
00:58:48.192 --> 00:58:48.943
All right. go ahead.

1212
00:58:49.026 --> 00:58:50.569
Really? Okay.

1213
00:58:52.696 --> 00:58:54.240
Yo. hey Rach.
What's up?

1214
00:58:54.323 --> 00:58:55.950
I can only talk
for a few minutes.

1215
00:58:56.033 --> 00:59:00.120
Jessie is a great roommate. but
she's throwing her third party

1216
00:59:00.204 --> 00:59:01.622
in four days. and she's...

1217
00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:04.291
Jason?

1218
00:59:04.375 --> 00:59:05.709
Are you okay?

1219
00:59:05.793 --> 00:59:07.253
What? I'm fine.

1220
00:59:07.336 --> 00:59:09.255
That's... how about you?

1221
00:59:09.338 --> 00:59:11.882
Well. actually.
I'm a little worried.

1222
00:59:11.966 --> 00:59:14.385
My mom called. and
I tried calling her back.

1223
00:59:14.468 --> 00:59:15.594
and she's not picking up.

1224
00:59:15.678 --> 00:59:18.138
Oh. uh.
that's. you know.

1225
00:59:18.222 --> 00:59:21.058
It's her. cause her phone.
it's um. her phone is broken.

1226
00:59:21.141 --> 00:59:22.476
You saw her?

1227
00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:23.936
Yeah. they had a
yard sale yesterday.

1228
00:59:24.019 --> 00:59:25.437
A yard sale?

1229
00:59:25.521 --> 00:59:27.606
No. that's.. I'm sorry.
"yard sale." what's...

1230
00:59:27.690 --> 00:59:29.650
no. they were. cause they
were in the yard. so...

1231
00:59:29.733 --> 00:59:31.318
I ran into them cause
I took a shortcut.

1232
00:59:31.402 --> 00:59:35.030
Um. to. to go to work at
Staples. where I am the

1233
00:59:35.114 --> 00:59:36.323
assistant manager.

1234
00:59:36.407 --> 00:59:39.326
This is weird.
Mom always calls me right back.

1235
00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:40.536
This isn't like her.

1236
00:59:40.619 --> 00:59:45.082
Well. it could be 'cause
she's singing and dancing.

1237
00:59:45.165 --> 00:59:46.500
and also blowing someone.

1238
00:59:46.584 --> 00:59:48.586
Uh. her birthday. Isn't
it her birthday pretty soon?

1239
00:59:48.669 --> 00:59:51.255
Oh of course. poor mom.

1240
00:59:52.214 --> 00:59:55.676
Jason. I should surprise her.

1241
00:59:56.760 --> 00:59:58.721
I'll come home for her
birthday. she'll love that.

1242
00:59:58.804 --> 01:00:00.014
Yeah. yeah. they both would.

1243
01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:01.223
Yeah. they would both
love that for sure.

1244
01:00:01.307 --> 01:00:02.224
You should come on down.

1245
01:00:02.308 --> 01:00:03.559
I'll try dad. he'll love it.

1246
01:00:03.642 --> 01:00:06.103
I'll get tulips. tulips are her
favourite flowers. and I'll

1247
01:00:06.186 --> 01:00:08.856
invite all her sisters. and
everyone will be there...

1248
01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:16.196
That's funny. you hear that?

1249
01:00:17.406 --> 01:00:19.533
It's my dad's ringtone.

1250
01:00:22.911 --> 01:00:24.413
Okay. you know what. Rachel?

1251
01:00:24.496 --> 01:00:25.956
I really gotta
tell you something.

1252
01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:27.082
Actually. your parents...

1253
01:00:29.627 --> 01:00:32.921
Jason. you really are a little
quisling. you know that?

1254
01:00:33.005 --> 01:00:35.382
Okay. he was from Norway.

1255
01:00:35.466 --> 01:00:38.093
I felt terrible
lying to Rachel.

1256
01:00:38.177 --> 01:00:40.638
I understand. because you never
know when the lies are going to

1257
01:00:40.721 --> 01:00:44.224
stop and they just keep coming.
Pushing you out of the way.

1258
01:00:44.308 --> 01:00:47.186
taking over
your life completely.

1259
01:00:47.269 --> 01:00:50.230
What a beautiful street.

1260
01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:51.607
Do you have raccoons?

1261
01:00:51.690 --> 01:00:53.901
Yeah. sporadically.

1262
01:00:53.984 --> 01:00:55.027
I love them.

1263
01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:56.320
Is that your guy's moving truck?

1264
01:00:56.403 --> 01:00:59.323
No. Well. yes. we're just
trying to sell a few things.

1265
01:00:59.406 --> 01:01:01.075
From the back of a truck?

1266
01:01:01.158 --> 01:01:03.369
Eh. we're trying to
finish off our yard sale.

1267
01:01:03.452 --> 01:01:05.788
For the truck and the computer.
using that. uh. Skype thing.

1268
01:01:05.871 --> 01:01:06.789
Anyhow.

1269
01:01:06.872 --> 01:01:08.290
You mean like a
virtual yard sale?

1270
01:01:08.374 --> 01:01:11.085
Wow. did you come up with
that idea. Mr. Teagarten?

1271
01:01:11.168 --> 01:01:12.378
What? Uh. yeah. sure.

1272
01:01:12.461 --> 01:01:13.462
Anyway. thanks for
your help and...

1273
01:01:13.545 --> 01:01:14.838
That's genius!
Do you see the potential?

1274
01:01:14.922 --> 01:01:16.757
Not one iota.
We gotta run now.

1275
01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:19.468
Wait. Mr. and Mrs. Teagarten.
I think there's something

1276
01:01:19.551 --> 01:01:20.469
I need to show you.

1277
01:01:20.552 --> 01:01:22.680
For the love of Christ.
Jason. what is it?

1278
01:01:28.143 --> 01:01:30.479
So the park was actually
built in the '50s. it kind of

1279
01:01:30.562 --> 01:01:34.233
fell on hard times. was vacant
for a while. so some friends

1280
01:01:34.316 --> 01:01:37.319
and I we pooled our money and
bought it. and we spent the

1281
01:01:37.403 --> 01:01:39.363
last two years
just fixing it up.

1282
01:01:39.446 --> 01:01:41.448
Jason. this is amazing.

1283
01:01:41.532 --> 01:01:42.741
Thank you.

1284
01:01:45.327 --> 01:01:46.787
This is what I
wanted to show you.

1285
01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:49.623
All of our trailer homes have a
storage space. because people

1286
01:01:49.707 --> 01:01:52.042
are downsizing from
like 3500 square feet.

1287
01:01:52.126 --> 01:01:55.003
These days I guess it's
like that everywhere.

1288
01:01:55.087 --> 01:01:57.464
So this is where your
virtual yard sale comes in.

1289
01:01:57.548 --> 01:02:01.510
You can upload streaming video
and people can browse it.

1290
01:02:01.593 --> 01:02:02.886
like in real time.

1291
01:02:02.970 --> 01:02:06.140
So you've got almost a live yard
sale. but you're bidding like

1292
01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:10.185
eBay online. so you call
it something like YardBay.

1293
01:02:11.645 --> 01:02:14.523
I'm sure you've thought all this
through. but I'd love to help.

1294
01:02:14.606 --> 01:02:16.275
I can computer
code it all for you.

1295
01:02:19.403 --> 01:02:20.362
Hello?

1296
01:02:21.572 --> 01:02:22.698
No. Mr. Teagarten no here.

1297
01:02:22.781 --> 01:02:24.366
Call back later.

1298
01:02:25.701 --> 01:02:28.579
He in the shower now. washing
his body with shampoo and honey.

1299
01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:31.206
He have a shingles.

1300
01:02:34.543 --> 01:02:36.920
That was an old fraternity
buddy of mine. Clyde Drexler.

1301
01:02:37.755 --> 01:02:39.214
I mean. he's a fan
of Clyde Drexler.

1302
01:02:39.298 --> 01:02:39.923
Mm-hmm.

1303
01:02:40.007 --> 01:02:41.008
Trailblazers.

1304
01:02:41.091 --> 01:02:43.677
Um. anyway. uh. thanks
for the tour Jason.

1305
01:02:43.761 --> 01:02:45.846
This was impressive.
Mobile homes and crap.

1306
01:02:45.929 --> 01:02:48.307
I'm sorry. that
sounded patronizing.

1307
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:50.350
Food for thought.

1308
01:02:50.434 --> 01:02:51.852
Thanks for your
help with the video.

1309
01:02:51.935 --> 01:02:53.145
Anytime.

1310
01:02:57.649 --> 01:02:59.318
Boy.
Jason sure can talk.

1311
01:03:00.444 --> 01:03:01.737
Okay. I better call Randall
and tell him I'll take that

1312
01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:03.614
catalytic converter job.

1313
01:03:05.032 --> 01:03:07.409
Okay. I'm
gonna go get a Baby Ruth.

1314
01:03:08.994 --> 01:03:10.662
A Baby Ruth?

1315
01:03:17.503 --> 01:03:18.504
Shit.

1316
01:03:22.925 --> 01:03:24.009
Excuse me.

1317
01:03:24.635 --> 01:03:26.053
Hey. I'm sorry to bother ya.

1318
01:03:26.136 --> 01:03:29.014
Do you have any change. or
better yet. do you mind if I use

1319
01:03:29.097 --> 01:03:31.141
your cell phone. it's
kind of an emergency.

1320
01:03:31.225 --> 01:03:33.018
A Baby Ruth candy bar.

1321
01:03:33.101 --> 01:03:34.937
Oh. Baby Ruth.

1322
01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:36.772
I thought you said Zagnut.

1323
01:03:36.855 --> 01:03:38.023
Uh. do you have one?

1324
01:03:38.106 --> 01:03:39.566
Yeah. let me check in the back.

1325
01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:41.401
I'll take two if you have em.

1326
01:03:43.278 --> 01:03:44.196
Buddy. cool off.

1327
01:03:44.279 --> 01:03:46.406
I'm not trying to cause
any problems here.

1328
01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:49.910
You act like you got 50 kilos
back there or something.

1329
01:03:49.993 --> 01:03:52.579
Oh. by the way. how much are...
What? What?

1330
01:03:52.663 --> 01:03:55.082

I found the
king size. is that okay?

1332
01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:12.683
Hello? King size okay?

1333
01:04:14.518 --> 01:04:17.437
You try that
again. motherfucker?

1334
01:04:17.521 --> 01:04:19.273
I'm gonna bust
your fucking head open.

1335

Everybody put your
hands where I can see em!

1336
01:04:24.945 --> 01:04:25.988
On the ground!

1337
01:04:26.071 --> 01:04:27.698
Get on the ground now!

1338
01:04:37.332 --> 01:04:38.667
Jackpot.

1339
01:04:45.382 --> 01:04:47.301
Turns out it was 120 kilos.

1340
01:04:47.759 --> 01:04:50.012
Teagarten.
Frank Teagarten.

1341
01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:55.267
FBI wants to talk to you.
Come on.

1342
01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:57.269
The FBI wants to talk to me?
Why?

1343
01:04:58.228 --> 01:04:59.605
They think you're good lookin'.
Come on.

1344
01:05:02.608 --> 01:05:03.567
Not you.

1345
01:05:14.453 --> 01:05:15.495
Are you okay?

1346
01:05:18.206 --> 01:05:20.500
It seems to me you're
as scared as I am.

1347
01:05:21.752 --> 01:05:23.545
I'm not scared for myself.

1348
01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:27.674
For my daughter.

1349
01:05:28.842 --> 01:05:30.218
We're done talkin'.

1350
01:05:36.183 --> 01:05:37.935
I have a daughter. too.

1351
01:05:39.061 --> 01:05:41.897
Our biggest fear in life
was to disappoint her.

1352
01:05:44.232 --> 01:05:48.278
I'm so ashamed and
worried. and...

1353
01:05:48.362 --> 01:05:50.572
Don't be bitching
to me about your rich life

1354
01:05:50.656 --> 01:05:52.407
and your spoiled brat daughter.

1355
01:05:52.491 --> 01:05:54.076
You know. you're gonna be out
of here in a minute.

1356
01:05:54.159 --> 01:05:55.827
and she'll have her mommy back.

1357
01:05:55.911 --> 01:05:59.373
But now thanks to you. I'm stuck
in here for god knows how long.

1358
01:05:59.456 --> 01:06:00.791
Yeah.

1359
01:06:00.874 --> 01:06:06.463
I will get out. but I will still
be a good-for-nothing fuckup.

1360
01:06:07.881 --> 01:06:10.717
And that might not mean a lot to
you. since it looks like you've

1361
01:06:10.801 --> 01:06:15.847
been a fuckup for a while. but
we only fucked up for one week.

1362
01:06:15.931 --> 01:06:20.602
One week. is all it took
for us to ruin her life.

1363
01:06:20.686 --> 01:06:24.231
She's only 19. and now she's...

1364
01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:25.399
Are you kidding me?

1365
01:06:25.482 --> 01:06:27.234
Your daughter's 19.

1366
01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:28.694
She's supposed to be
taking care of herself.

1367
01:06:29.528 --> 01:06:33.031
My Rose. she's only 7.

1368
01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:38.161
And now. she's all
alone in the world.

1369
01:06:38.996 --> 01:06:40.247
She's got nobody.

1370
01:06:44.376 --> 01:06:48.630
Woman. you have no
idea what shame is.

1371
01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.216
Shit.

1372
01:06:51.299 --> 01:06:53.051
You win.

1373
01:06:55.887 --> 01:06:57.305
Hey. Frank.

1374
01:06:57.389 --> 01:06:59.266
I'm special agent Milhouse.

1375
01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:01.685
This is special agent Barnes.

1376
01:07:01.768 --> 01:07:02.936
Weird night. huh?

1377
01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:04.104
- Yeah.
- God.

1378
01:07:04.187 --> 01:07:07.190
120 kilos of Norteno Cocaine.

1379
01:07:07.274 --> 01:07:08.775
A hell of a bust.

1380
01:07:08.859 --> 01:07:09.943
Yeah.

1381
01:07:10.027 --> 01:07:12.988
You know that we had nothing
to do with this. right?

1382
01:07:13.071 --> 01:07:16.450
Oh. so you think that
we just send out our whole

1383
01:07:16.533 --> 01:07:18.326
field office just for fun.

1384
01:07:19.244 --> 01:07:20.454
This is what we know.

1385
01:07:20.537 --> 01:07:22.789
We've been tailing Chope for
three days. since he entered

1386
01:07:22.873 --> 01:07:24.207
the United States.

1387
01:07:24.291 --> 01:07:26.793
Next thing we know. the three
of you are in a Kwik-E-Mart

1388
01:07:26.877 --> 01:07:29.963
parking lot free for all. so I
think we've got a problem here.

1389
01:07:30.047 --> 01:07:31.381
don't you?

1390
01:07:31.465 --> 01:07:33.008
Frank. if you want to get out
of here tonight. you've got to

1391
01:07:33.091 --> 01:07:35.302
convince us you're not
some big rich drug lord.

1392
01:07:35.385 --> 01:07:36.845
Like. for real.

1393
01:07:38.972 --> 01:07:41.391
Hello?
Mr. Teagarten no home. his phone

1394
01:07:41.475 --> 01:07:44.853
went through a snow blower.
and he chop his head right off.

1395
01:07:50.275 --> 01:07:52.819
I guess owing 300
bucks to Mastercard helped

1396
01:07:52.903 --> 01:07:55.947
convince them we aren't
Mr. and Mrs. El Chapo.

1397
01:07:56.031 --> 01:07:58.950
I can't help thinking
about that little girl.

1398
01:07:59.034 --> 01:08:00.410
Nancy. what are you gonna do?

1399
01:08:00.494 --> 01:08:03.371
Have her come live with us in
this fucking Perri Winkle truck?

1400
01:08:06.625 --> 01:08:08.126
God. this day sucked.

1401
01:08:10.087 --> 01:08:13.090
Carl. he found my medals.

1402
01:08:13.924 --> 01:08:14.966
How did he find them?

1403
01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:16.426
He's a sneaky motherfucker.

1404
01:08:16.510 --> 01:08:20.972
But those medals made me
remember that I used to win.

1405
01:08:22.099 --> 01:08:23.809
I used to have an edge.

1406
01:08:25.102 --> 01:08:28.355
This week. I've cried more
than I have ever cried before.

1407
01:08:29.564 --> 01:08:31.775
and for things that I
would have never cried about

1408
01:08:31.858 --> 01:08:33.318
in the old days.

1409
01:08:35.112 --> 01:08:39.199
It's like I've become
this person I don't know.

1410
01:08:39.282 --> 01:08:40.534
and I don't like.

1411
01:08:41.701 --> 01:08:42.911
Where is this headed?

1412
01:08:45.497 --> 01:08:47.290
We need to talk to Dan.

1413
01:08:47.374 --> 01:08:48.750
Why. and beg for money?

1414
01:08:48.834 --> 01:08:49.876
That's not getting
your edge back.

1415
01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:51.545
That's surrendering.
not winning.

1416
01:08:51.628 --> 01:08:54.214
Guys like Dan. they take
advantage of weakness.

1417
01:08:56.216 --> 01:08:57.717
I'll figure it out.

1418
01:08:59.469 --> 01:09:00.720
I think.

1419
01:09:02.347 --> 01:09:05.684
I bet Rachel used to take
one of those buses to school.

1420
01:09:06.977 --> 01:09:09.646
Long ago. back in the time
when she used to look up to me

1421
01:09:09.729 --> 01:09:11.398
like I was Superman.

1422
01:09:14.317 --> 01:09:16.278
Oh. Frank.

1423
01:09:20.824 --> 01:09:22.367
You crying?

1424
01:09:23.994 --> 01:09:26.830
You were crying.
What a pussy.

1425
01:09:26.913 --> 01:09:28.206
No. I'm not crying.

1426
01:09:28.290 --> 01:09:31.418
But if I was. it's
because good god.

1427
01:09:31.501 --> 01:09:32.794
It's because the
two of you reek.

1428
01:09:32.878 --> 01:09:34.296
Fuck you.

1429
01:09:34.379 --> 01:09:36.381
Hey. you got 10 bucks?
For gas?

1430
01:09:36.464 --> 01:09:39.009
Wow. what timing you have. bum.

1431
01:09:39.092 --> 01:09:40.844
No. actually. we don't
have 10 bucks for gas.

1432
01:09:40.927 --> 01:09:42.304
Liar.

1433
01:09:42.387 --> 01:09:44.097
That's some high-end furniture
you got there. rich asshole.

1434
01:09:44.181 --> 01:09:45.348
Rich?

1435
01:09:45.432 --> 01:09:47.809
You have completely misread
our situation. my man.

1436
01:09:47.893 --> 01:09:49.769
Oh. woah. woah.
I'm not your man.

1437
01:09:49.853 --> 01:09:51.855
He's not your man. fish face.

1438
01:09:53.273 --> 01:09:55.400
I don't think anybody's ever
called me fish face before.

1439
01:09:55.483 --> 01:09:56.860
Good.

1440
01:09:56.943 --> 01:09:58.778
You believe this pile of
fish face. calling me "his man?"

1441
01:09:58.862 --> 01:10:01.781
I'm not your man. so fuck you.

1442
01:10:01.865 --> 01:10:04.951
No. no. It's. uh.
it's more like fuck you.

1443
01:10:05.035 --> 01:10:07.287
I'm sorry. you're not
understanding what we're saying.

1444
01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:08.622
Fuck you.

1445
01:10:08.705 --> 01:10:09.706
What's your name?

1446
01:10:09.789 --> 01:10:10.540
Will.

1447
01:10:10.624 --> 01:10:11.458
What's your name?

1448
01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:12.709
Colin.

1449
01:10:12.792 --> 01:10:14.628
Will. Collin.

1450
01:10:15.503 --> 01:10:16.796
Fuck you.

1451
01:10:18.256 --> 01:10:19.507
Fish face.

1452
01:10:24.930 --> 01:10:26.014
So?

1453
01:10:26.097 --> 01:10:27.641
How long do we sit here for?

1454
01:10:27.724 --> 01:10:28.934
I'm not sure.

1455
01:10:29.893 --> 01:10:32.145
Hey. What are
you doing out there?

1456
01:10:34.272 --> 01:10:35.607
So. what do we got here?

1457
01:10:36.608 --> 01:10:37.817
Where's the other bum?

1458
01:10:37.901 --> 01:10:38.818
Maui.

1459
01:10:38.902 --> 01:10:40.111
I could buy a couple of things.

1460
01:10:40.195 --> 01:10:42.113
Woah. woah. woah. you think
this is some kind of a store?

1461
01:10:42.197 --> 01:10:43.907
What else would
you be doing here?

1462
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:46.409
Well. actually. it's kind
of a- an incredible story.

1463
01:10:46.493 --> 01:10:48.161
- Nancy!
- How much for the paint?

1464
01:10:48.245 --> 01:10:49.829
Spray paint. I'd
like to huff it.

1465
01:10:49.913 --> 01:10:51.122
You want to huff it?

1466
01:10:51.206 --> 01:10:53.083
You want to huff the
can of spray paint?

1467
01:10:53.166 --> 01:10:55.377
You're like. the worst bum ever.

1468
01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:56.378
What is it. a pageant?

1469
01:10:56.461 --> 01:10:57.462
And you came in last.

1470
01:10:57.545 --> 01:10:58.838
Okay. five bucks.

1471
01:10:58.922 --> 01:11:01.258
Five bucks for a can of paint?

1472
01:11:01.341 --> 01:11:02.884
That's what I said.
Five bucks. yes or no.

1473
01:11:02.968 --> 01:11:04.552
There's a line
forming behind you.

1474
01:11:05.637 --> 01:11:07.681
I made you
look. you fucking idiot.

1475
01:11:07.764 --> 01:11:08.807
Fuck off.

1476
01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.354
Stop lookin at me.

1477
01:11:14.437 --> 01:11:15.981
Get away from the gas tank. bum.

1478
01:11:16.064 --> 01:11:17.399
Fuck you.

1479
01:11:22.195 --> 01:11:23.196
Stop and drop.

1480
01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:26.032
Why is this happening?

1481
01:11:26.116 --> 01:11:27.367
You're on fire!

1482
01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:29.160
Run. get the fire extinguisher!

1483
01:11:31.121 --> 01:11:33.581
You not gonna stop. man?
He's on fire!

1484
01:11:33.665 --> 01:11:35.834
I don't need this
shit in my life!

1485
01:11:42.132 --> 01:11:45.218
Oh yeah. lie
on me. get on me girl.

1486
01:11:45.302 --> 01:11:47.721
Oh yeah. grind me
out like a cigarette.

1487
01:11:48.555 --> 01:11:50.682
Yeah. let me return the favour.

1488
01:11:50.765 --> 01:11:52.142
I'm anything but a gentleman.

1489
01:11:52.225 --> 01:11:53.727
Are you okay...

1490
01:11:54.936 --> 01:11:56.229
That's my wife. bum.

1491
01:11:59.566 --> 01:12:01.276
She got on me. dude.

1492
01:12:04.321 --> 01:12:06.740
Bum. put those lamps back.

1493
01:12:08.116 --> 01:12:10.118
So.
that's the basic concept.

1494
01:12:10.201 --> 01:12:15.248
Mmm. Sounds like a good idea.
What. you're calling it YardBay?

1495
01:12:15.332 --> 01:12:16.041
YardBay.

1496
01:12:16.124 --> 01:12:18.043
Great name for a great idea.

1497
01:12:18.126 --> 01:12:19.377
Well. it's Frank's idea.

1498
01:12:19.461 --> 01:12:20.795
You hear that. bums?

1499
01:12:20.879 --> 01:12:22.672
The great idea was my idea.

1500
01:12:22.756 --> 01:12:25.216
A shovel swinging in your
face would be a good idea.

1501
01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:29.179
He already did that.

1502
01:12:29.262 --> 01:12:31.514
While smoking a spider.

1503
01:12:33.099 --> 01:12:35.393
Oh. I believe it.
cause he's a huge dumbass.

1504
01:12:35.477 --> 01:12:37.437
Look at his fat fish face.

1505
01:12:38.355 --> 01:12:41.441
Frank is a
banana split of shit.

1506
01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:43.693
I don't like that.

1507
01:12:43.777 --> 01:12:46.529
I hate to say it. but Frank
is right about one thing.

1508
01:12:47.197 --> 01:12:48.782
You got a good idea.

1509
01:12:48.865 --> 01:12:49.949
Okay?

1510
01:12:51.368 --> 01:12:53.370
But you gotta go in strong when
you're dealing with rich people.

1511
01:12:53.453 --> 01:12:54.996
Otherwise they'll prey on you.

1512
01:12:56.081 --> 01:12:59.167
I would know that. cause I used
to be one of those people.

1513
01:13:00.293 --> 01:13:03.338
Put me out. fish face!

1514
01:13:08.843 --> 01:13:11.179
All right.
I'm out. I'm out.

1515
01:13:11.262 --> 01:13:12.430
You okay?

1516
01:13:12.514 --> 01:13:13.181
Yeah.

1517
01:13:13.264 --> 01:13:14.057
What happened?

1518
01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:15.308
Cigarette.

1519
01:13:15.392 --> 01:13:17.394
Ah. yeah.
Same thing happened to me.

1520
01:13:17.477 --> 01:13:18.436
Feel stupid.

1521
01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:19.521
Yeah.

1522
01:13:19.604 --> 01:13:21.272
All right. well. goodbye Frank.

1523
01:13:21.356 --> 01:13:23.608
Hope a train falls on your face.

1524
01:13:25.568 --> 01:13:27.946
Go siphon some gas
and smoke a cigarette. bum.

1525
01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:30.323
Touché.

1526
01:13:31.324 --> 01:13:32.867
You sure you're all right?

1527
01:13:32.951 --> 01:13:35.370
Yeah. I did the same thing
and next thing you know.

1528
01:13:35.453 --> 01:13:37.038
the flames just jump on ya.

1529
01:13:37.122 --> 01:13:38.248
You think it's
the cigarette. or?

1530
01:13:38.331 --> 01:13:39.374
50/50 chance.

1531
01:13:39.457 --> 01:13:40.959
They were sweet.

1532
01:13:42.961 --> 01:13:44.504
Colin and Will.

1533
01:13:45.463 --> 01:13:46.589
Fuck them.

1534
01:13:57.934 --> 01:14:00.186
Why is there
furniture on the lawn?

1535
01:14:03.648 --> 01:14:06.192
Maybe they were partying.

1536
01:14:06.276 --> 01:14:08.403
They're not like that. Jessie.

1537
01:14:09.988 --> 01:14:11.364
You coming inside?

1538
01:14:11.448 --> 01:14:13.158
I want to start setting
up for the surprise.

1539
01:14:13.241 --> 01:14:15.118
Um. yeah. in a minute.

1540
01:14:15.201 --> 01:14:18.288
I got the spins. I'm just gonna
go back to bed for a little bit.

1541
01:14:18.371 --> 01:14:19.414
Okay.

1542
01:14:26.212 --> 01:14:27.464
That's weird.

1543
01:14:29.382 --> 01:14:30.300
Woah. woah. woah!

1544
01:14:30.383 --> 01:14:31.676
Hey.

1545
01:14:31.759 --> 01:14:34.262
If you're here for the yard
sale. it's in the yard.

1546
01:14:34.345 --> 01:14:35.388
Who are you?

1547
01:14:35.472 --> 01:14:36.556
Who am I?

1548
01:14:36.639 --> 01:14:38.433
I'm a guy holding pepper spray.

1549
01:14:38.516 --> 01:14:39.559
12 ounces...

1550
01:14:39.642 --> 01:14:43.021
3 ounces of pepper spray
at your eyes. all right?

1551
01:14:43.104 --> 01:14:44.022
Who are you?

1552
01:14:44.105 --> 01:14:46.065
I'm Rachel.

1553
01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:47.525
I live here.

1554
01:14:47.609 --> 01:14:50.069
Oh my god. Rachel?

1555
01:14:50.153 --> 01:14:50.904
Yeah.

1556
01:14:50.987 --> 01:14:52.572
Oh. I've heard so
much about you.

1557
01:14:53.364 --> 01:14:54.574
I'm Carl.

1558
01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:59.245
Carl. I think you're gonna

1559
01:14:59.329 --> 01:15:01.498
need to explain to
me what's going on.

1560
01:15:05.376 --> 01:15:08.254
Baby. I think I
figured something out.

1561
01:15:08.338 --> 01:15:10.840
and we're gonna call it
"The Carl."

1562
01:15:13.218 --> 01:15:14.385
Feeling good?

1563
01:15:14.761 --> 01:15:16.846
If good means nervous.

1564
01:15:16.930 --> 01:15:18.223
A Baby Ruth?

1565
01:15:18.306 --> 01:15:21.017
Sometimes a Baby Ruth
is just a candy bar.

1566
01:15:25.104 --> 01:15:27.982
The tournament is cancelled but
I'm sure Dan is still here.

1567
01:15:28.316 --> 01:15:29.943
This has to work.

1568
01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:32.570
You heard what those bums said.
we have to make these rich guys

1569
01:15:32.654 --> 01:15:33.905
wanna give us money.

1570
01:15:33.988 --> 01:15:35.740
Make'em need to give it to us.

1571
01:15:35.823 --> 01:15:38.618
It's fourth and goal. no time
on the clock. you got the ball.

1572
01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:40.245
and I'll just follow your lead.

1573
01:15:47.043 --> 01:15:48.044
Keep it close.

1574
01:15:50.046 --> 01:15:53.132
Oh no. that's not
"fuck you."

1575
01:15:53.216 --> 01:15:54.842
that's somebody else.

1576
01:15:56.511 --> 01:15:57.804
Can you wash it?

1577
01:15:58.388 --> 01:15:59.722
That's fine.

1578
01:16:01.057 --> 01:16:03.184
I have to go to the
locker room to clean up

1579
01:16:03.268 --> 01:16:04.936
and put on my secret weapon.

1580
01:16:05.019 --> 01:16:06.771
- Meet you at the golf carts.
- Okay.

1581
01:16:08.022 --> 01:16:11.150
Okay. well then. where
did they go after that?

1582
01:16:11.234 --> 01:16:12.986
I don't know.

1583
01:16:13.069 --> 01:16:16.239
I mean. it seems to
change every 16 minutes.

1584
01:16:16.948 --> 01:16:18.658
Frankly. I'm worried.

1585
01:16:18.741 --> 01:16:22.912
And your mother. I mean. maybe
you know her better than me.

1586
01:16:22.996 --> 01:16:25.582
but she seems a little unhinged.

1587
01:16:25.665 --> 01:16:29.335
But the point is. I think
your surprise birthday party

1588
01:16:29.419 --> 01:16:31.129
is a wonderful idea.

1589
01:16:31.212 --> 01:16:32.463
Have you ever seen
The Wedding Planner?

1590
01:16:32.547 --> 01:16:34.173
- Mm.
- With J-Lo?

1591
01:16:34.257 --> 01:16:35.925
That's short for Jennifer Lopez.

1592
01:16:36.009 --> 01:16:39.804
Anyway. I love J-Lo.
and not just because she's

1593
01:16:39.887 --> 01:16:42.640
a fellow Latina.
I love her for her dancing.

1594
01:16:42.724 --> 01:16:46.019
I love her for her singing.
I love her for her acting.

1595
01:16:46.102 --> 01:16:47.937
but I never liked her perfume.

1596
01:16:48.021 --> 01:16:49.230
It was gross.

1597
01:16:49.314 --> 01:16:52.942
Carl. I don't think
we're gonna have a party.

1598
01:16:53.985 --> 01:16:55.820
I need to call my
Aunt Betty. and...

1599
01:16:55.903 --> 01:17:00.325
Okay. I need like 12 billion
aspirin and one ounce...

1600
01:17:00.408 --> 01:17:03.995
Oh my god. who is
this hunk of stud hunk...

1601
01:17:04.078 --> 01:17:06.039
Jessie. this is Carl.

1602
01:17:06.122 --> 01:17:09.542
He's. I guess. staying with us.

1603
01:17:09.626 --> 01:17:11.836
Hi. I'm Jessie.

1604
01:17:11.919 --> 01:17:13.921
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

1605
01:17:14.005 --> 01:17:17.800
Did you just call
me a hunk of stud?

1606
01:17:17.884 --> 01:17:21.888
If I was a shark. man.
I would just chomp

1607
01:17:21.971 --> 01:17:24.599
into you like a
little baby seal.

1608
01:17:30.188 --> 01:17:33.066
Please god. don't let
this be a fucking dream.

1609
01:17:40.698 --> 01:17:41.908
Hey. Andy.

1610
01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:43.284
Danny boy.

1611
01:17:43.368 --> 01:17:45.495
Mm.

1612
01:17:46.162 --> 01:17:47.580
Look at that. there's
Nancy at the bar.

1613
01:17:47.664 --> 01:17:48.498
Ooh.

1614
01:17:48.581 --> 01:17:49.874
Saluuut.

1615
01:17:49.957 --> 01:17:51.376
Fancy Nancy.

1616
01:17:51.459 --> 01:17:52.460
Hey guys.

1617
01:17:52.543 --> 01:17:54.170
Hey. Frank.

1618
01:17:54.253 --> 01:17:55.505
Yeah. she's having a few.

1619
01:17:56.714 --> 01:17:58.257
Right now. she couldn't
see the hole in a ladder.

1620
01:17:59.634 --> 01:18:01.469
We've been
celebrating some good news.

1621
01:18:01.552 --> 01:18:03.179
Oh. yeah?
What good news is that?

1622
01:18:03.262 --> 01:18:05.181
Some Silicon Valley news.

1623
01:18:05.264 --> 01:18:06.307
Ooh.

1624
01:18:06.391 --> 01:18:08.601
Hiiii guys.

1625
01:18:08.685 --> 01:18:12.605
Oh bummer. they
cancelled your game.

1626
01:18:12.689 --> 01:18:13.815
I know. I know.

1627
01:18:13.898 --> 01:18:15.483
White balls. white
snow. you know.

1628
01:18:15.566 --> 01:18:17.443
Well. white balls
are better than blue.

1629
01:18:17.527 --> 01:18:18.945
You ever run track?

1630
01:18:19.028 --> 01:18:21.280
Ever run track?
Ever run track?

1631
01:18:21.364 --> 01:18:22.532
You mean with our feet?

1632
01:18:22.615 --> 01:18:23.908
That's why they have golf carts.

1633
01:18:23.991 --> 01:18:25.868
Oh. stop right there baby.

1634
01:18:25.952 --> 01:18:29.330
I need you to pay
attention and to focus.

1635
01:18:29.414 --> 01:18:32.458
because I'm about
to organize you.

1636
01:18:32.542 --> 01:18:33.876
Baby can we talk for a second.

1637
01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:34.502
No.

1638
01:18:34.585 --> 01:18:35.795
No. Honey. I think...

1639
01:18:35.878 --> 01:18:38.840
I talk to you all the time.
I'm sick of talking to you.

1640
01:18:38.923 --> 01:18:39.882
I want to talk to them.

1641
01:18:39.966 --> 01:18:41.676
Stop trying to control me.

1642
01:18:42.802 --> 01:18:44.846
Enjoy the moment. fellas.

1643
01:18:45.722 --> 01:18:50.727
Well. I used to
run four-person relays.

1644
01:18:50.810 --> 01:18:52.145
and this is how it works.

1645
01:18:52.228 --> 01:18:57.066
The second fastest runner
usually starts the race.

1646
01:18:57.150 --> 01:19:00.403
That fucker needs
to get a good lead.

1647
01:19:00.486 --> 01:19:04.407
Andy. smart. hard worker.

1648
01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:07.368
You've earned your money.

1649
01:19:07.452 --> 01:19:08.453
Yes.

1650
01:19:08.536 --> 01:19:13.750
So. I am going to make
you the first runner.

1651
01:19:14.459 --> 01:19:16.210
Come with me.

1652
01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:22.717
The second runner needs to
be solid. and dependable.

1653
01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:23.801
That's you. Steve.

1654
01:19:23.885 --> 01:19:26.929
You've done well in Wall
Street. but you've never

1655
01:19:27.013 --> 01:19:28.890
done anything...

1656
01:19:29.766 --> 01:19:31.309
flashy.

1657
01:19:32.727 --> 01:19:36.272
I am so sorry Rob.
but the slowest

1658
01:19:36.355 --> 01:19:40.109
runner always runs third.

1659
01:19:40.193 --> 01:19:44.238
I know that you're rich.
but it's family money. baby.

1660
01:19:44.322 --> 01:19:47.074
You need to be hungry.

1661
01:19:47.158 --> 01:19:50.953
Maybe today.
shock us baby please.

1662
01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:54.999
And you. my Danny boy.

1663
01:19:56.334 --> 01:19:57.794
You're fourth.

1664
01:19:57.877 --> 01:19:59.253
I'm never fourth.

1665
01:19:59.337 --> 01:20:02.256
But the fourth runner is
always the fastest runner.

1666
01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:03.633
Ahh.

1667
01:20:03.716 --> 01:20:07.053
He's also the smartest runner.

1668
01:20:07.136 --> 01:20:10.181
Because he knows
what it takes to win.

1669
01:20:11.224 --> 01:20:14.727
Either dig deep to
make up for the lost time.

1670
01:20:14.811 --> 01:20:18.272
or run just fast
enough to hold the lead.

1671
01:20:18.356 --> 01:20:22.235
I was always the fourth runner.

1672
01:20:22.318 --> 01:20:25.780
Because I was very. very good.

1673
01:20:26.948 --> 01:20:30.076
So. let's stretch.

1674
01:20:30.159 --> 01:20:32.119
Warm up.

1675
01:20:32.203 --> 01:20:34.622
And assume the position.

1676
01:20:34.705 --> 01:20:36.082
Okay. now I like this part.

1677
01:20:36.165 --> 01:20:38.501
Isn't she something?

1678
01:20:38.584 --> 01:20:39.418
Stand up. baby.

1679
01:20:39.502 --> 01:20:41.546
So now what. we actually run?

1680
01:20:41.629 --> 01:20:46.050
Yes. and Frank is going to tell
you what's at the finish line.

1681
01:20:46.133 --> 01:20:47.301
No. no. baby...

1682
01:20:47.385 --> 01:20:49.512
We have no more room
for investors...

1683
01:20:49.595 --> 01:20:52.181
Please. please.
Frank. I mean. you cannot

1684
01:20:52.265 --> 01:20:56.602
trust those millionaires
from Silicon Valley.

1685
01:20:56.686 --> 01:21:01.649
Silicon is fake.
like the fake silicon boobs.

1686
01:21:01.732 --> 01:21:04.277
they're fake millionaires.
they're nouveau rich.

1687
01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:05.528
It's just a pitch.
it's a pitch...

1688
01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:07.196
Now you have to tell
him about the pig.

1689
01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:07.989
Say the pitch. come on.

1690
01:21:08.072 --> 01:21:10.283
Tell them about the pig.
The pig!

1691
01:21:10.366 --> 01:21:11.701
All right. all right. all right.

1692
01:21:13.578 --> 01:21:16.581
You know the phrase "burn down
the house to cook a pig?"

1693
01:21:17.832 --> 01:21:19.125
You don't have a lot of house
left. we have a lot of

1694
01:21:19.208 --> 01:21:20.877
cooked pig?

1695
01:21:22.169 --> 01:21:23.504
A lot of bankruptcy filings
in this country right now.

1696
01:21:23.588 --> 01:21:24.547
people have lost everything.

1697
01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:26.048
They gambled
and they got wiped out.

1698
01:21:26.841 --> 01:21:28.175
Have I got your attention?

1699
01:21:31.888 --> 01:21:35.558
We help them sell
the barbecued pork.

1700
01:21:36.475 --> 01:21:40.062
People browse yard
sales from home.

1701
01:21:40.897 --> 01:21:42.565
It's called YardBay.

1702
01:21:44.150 --> 01:21:45.693
Yeah baby.

1703
01:21:48.571 --> 01:21:49.572
I like it.

1704
01:21:50.323 --> 01:21:51.699
I like it.

1705
01:21:51.782 --> 01:21:53.200
Let's talk.

1706
01:21:53.284 --> 01:21:56.037
And the winner is....
Dan!

1707
01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:58.164
My wife is so...

1708
01:21:59.457 --> 01:22:00.666
Your acting was brilliant.

1709
01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:01.792
Well. I couldn't
have gotten home

1710
01:22:01.876 --> 01:22:03.252
if you didn't put me on 3rd.
baby.

1711
01:22:03.336 --> 01:22:04.629
I feel great.

1712
01:22:04.712 --> 01:22:05.838
Boy. it really was. wasn't it?

1713
01:22:05.922 --> 01:22:07.173
I just did a Carl.

1714
01:22:07.256 --> 01:22:10.676
My crazy made you look good.
and now they want YardBay!

1715
01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:12.053
I'm gonna call Jason.

1716
01:22:12.136 --> 01:22:14.180
I need to have something to
show Dan over lunch tomorrow.

1717
01:22:14.263 --> 01:22:15.431
Yes.

1718
01:22:16.223 --> 01:22:17.892
Oh. Frank. is it over?

1719
01:22:17.975 --> 01:22:20.645
Are we finally out
of this shit-storm?

1720
01:22:20.728 --> 01:22:23.230
I don't know how. but I
think we did it. didn't we?

1721
01:22:23.314 --> 01:22:25.566
Who said you can't
unring a bell?

1722
01:22:26.567 --> 01:22:28.152
Mom. Dad...

1723
01:22:28.235 --> 01:22:29.612
Rachel.

1724
01:22:31.113 --> 01:22:33.199
And I see you've met Carl.

1725
01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:34.659
Nancy. I've been so worried.

1726
01:22:34.742 --> 01:22:36.410
Carl told me everything.

1727
01:22:36.494 --> 01:22:40.790
I've tried piecing it
together. but I don't know.

1728
01:22:40.873 --> 01:22:43.626
I called Aunt Betty.
she's on her way here.

1729
01:22:43.709 --> 01:22:44.835
Great.

1730
01:22:44.919 --> 01:22:47.296
Honey. it's Nigel.

1731
01:22:48.047 --> 01:22:49.340
Yes...

1732
01:22:50.049 --> 01:22:51.092
Nige.

1733
01:22:51.175 --> 01:22:53.177
I'm sorry. did you
just call me "Nige?"

1734
01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:55.972
Uh. it's possible. I knew
a guy called Adolf Dick once.

1735
01:22:56.055 --> 01:22:57.223
that's a tough name. isn't it?

1736
01:22:57.306 --> 01:23:02.228
Listen. I just had an amazing
conversation with the police

1737
01:23:02.311 --> 01:23:06.107
who informed me that my
house has been burglarized.

1738
01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:09.944
I'm about to board this flight.
and come home and start ripping

1739
01:23:10.027 --> 01:23:12.029
some new assholes.
All right?

1740
01:23:12.113 --> 01:23:14.782
No. no. they caught the culprit.
everything's back in the house.

1741
01:23:14.865 --> 01:23:16.534
It's all good in
the hood. Nigel.

1742
01:23:16.617 --> 01:23:18.869
Oh. oh the police found him?

1743
01:23:18.953 --> 01:23:21.205
They didn't let me know that.
All right. listen.

1744
01:23:21.288 --> 01:23:24.000
I want the perpetrators.
I want them prosecuted

1745
01:23:24.083 --> 01:23:25.835
and I want them sent to jail.
okay?

1746
01:23:25.918 --> 01:23:26.961
No. no. Nigel.

1747
01:23:27.044 --> 01:23:29.880
The thief was hit by a
car and a bike and a rock.

1748
01:23:29.964 --> 01:23:31.590
Isn't that punishment enough?

1749
01:23:31.674 --> 01:23:34.844
You know. even 5000 miles away
I can still smell the bullshit.

1750
01:23:34.927 --> 01:23:36.178
I'm getting on this plane.

1751
01:23:36.262 --> 01:23:38.014
Or. I could go take a
picture of your living room

1752
01:23:38.097 --> 01:23:40.808
and send it to you. and you
could see how it's pristine.

1753
01:23:43.269 --> 01:23:44.770
Yeah. Send it.

1754
01:23:50.943 --> 01:23:54.488
All right. I understand
that you must be mad.

1755
01:23:54.572 --> 01:23:58.075
Mom. I'm mad that you didn't
trust me enough to tell me

1756
01:23:58.159 --> 01:23:59.452
what was going on.

1757
01:23:59.535 --> 01:24:03.831
And also. I'm mad
that I missed out

1758
01:24:03.914 --> 01:24:07.001
on seeing my amazing
parents in action.

1759
01:24:07.793 --> 01:24:09.503
I wish I could have been there.

1760
01:24:09.587 --> 01:24:12.923
because I'll never stop
learning from you guys.

1761
01:24:13.674 --> 01:24:15.551
Rachel.

1762
01:24:20.347 --> 01:24:21.766
Come upstairs to my closet.

1763
01:24:21.849 --> 01:24:23.434
It's now a panic room.

1764
01:24:24.226 --> 01:24:25.311
Hey pervert.

1765
01:24:26.187 --> 01:24:28.397
What did we tell you
about coming back here?

1766
01:24:32.985 --> 01:24:34.278
Where's the main deviant?

1767
01:24:34.361 --> 01:24:35.362
Jason?

1768
01:24:35.446 --> 01:24:37.823
Don't worry. Rach.
I got this.

1769
01:24:37.907 --> 01:24:40.618
No Jason.
don't mess with these guys.

1770
01:24:40.701 --> 01:24:43.662
Frank. we
have a problema!

1771
01:24:43.746 --> 01:24:47.249
No. no. no. Nobody speaks to
Mrs. Teagarten like that.

1772
01:24:48.209 --> 01:24:50.377
What you got there. ironsides?
A cap gun?

1773
01:24:50.461 --> 01:24:51.629
Tasers.

1774
01:24:51.712 --> 01:24:52.880
I carry rent money.

1775
01:24:57.676 --> 01:24:59.762
Holy shit.
those are police tasers.

1776
01:24:59.845 --> 01:25:01.680
Oh. I want that fucker.

1777
01:25:01.764 --> 01:25:03.265
- Be prepared to meet your...
- Give me one.

1778
01:25:03.349 --> 01:25:04.934
Hey. kids.
What are you guys doing here?

1779
01:25:05.017 --> 01:25:06.352
An X-26-6000?

1780
01:25:06.435 --> 01:25:08.020
I'm just right in the middle
of something super important.

1781
01:25:08.104 --> 01:25:10.523
- We really don't want these...
- Back off you stupid fuck.

1782
01:25:10.606 --> 01:25:11.565
Fight me!

1783
01:25:11.649 --> 01:25:12.525
Who are you kids?
Please leave me be...

1784
01:25:12.608 --> 01:25:13.651
Suck a fat one.

1785
01:25:13.734 --> 01:25:14.860
My girlfriend is watching!

1786
01:25:14.944 --> 01:25:15.945
Pussy!

1787
01:25:16.028 --> 01:25:17.154
Take the tasers.
you wore me down.

1788
01:25:20.491 --> 01:25:21.325
Who are you?

1789
01:25:21.408 --> 01:25:22.493
I'm Plumber.

1790
01:25:23.119 --> 01:25:24.453
Ugh!

1791
01:25:24.537 --> 01:25:26.622
Ready for some shock
and awe. fuckers?

1792
01:25:26.705 --> 01:25:27.748
Amen.

1793
01:25:30.835 --> 01:25:32.419
Kneel before your god.

1794
01:25:33.504 --> 01:25:35.047
You guys are wonderful children.
Both of you.

1795
01:25:35.131 --> 01:25:36.215
All right guys.

1796
01:25:37.424 --> 01:25:38.759
All right. we're good.

1797
01:25:38.843 --> 01:25:40.803
Yeah. for once we're having
fucking fun in our lives.

1798
01:25:40.886 --> 01:25:43.139
because you never gave us a good
childhood. so can you just like.

1799
01:25:43.222 --> 01:25:44.390
let us have fun?

1800
01:25:54.483 --> 01:25:56.193
Nice.

1801
01:25:56.277 --> 01:25:57.236
All right. We're done.

1802
01:25:57.319 --> 01:25:58.112
...that was amazing.

1803
01:25:58.195 --> 01:25:59.113
Thanks. baby.

1804
01:26:01.115 --> 01:26:02.867
Okay. I understand the impulse.

1805
01:26:04.118 --> 01:26:06.245
But let's have no more of
this vigilante justice. okay?

1806
01:26:06.328 --> 01:26:08.664
We have to have law and order.
Believe me. I would know.

1807
01:26:16.130 --> 01:26:17.965
All right. listen up.

1808
01:26:18.048 --> 01:26:19.466
We've got two minutes.

1809
01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:20.885
Everything inside.

1810
01:26:22.845 --> 01:26:24.805
Sir. you really need to board.

1811
01:26:24.889 --> 01:26:26.515
Yeah. all right. all right.

1812
01:26:29.643 --> 01:26:33.314
All right. uh. pull my bags off
the plane. I'm going to Nepal.

1813
01:26:33.397 --> 01:26:34.648
You can't be serious.

1814
01:26:34.732 --> 01:26:36.984
Yeah. hurry up. come on. lady!
Let's go.

1815
01:26:37.067 --> 01:26:38.777
Pull the trigger on my bags.

1816
01:26:38.861 --> 01:26:42.615
Uh. airport security
to Gate B31.

1817
01:26:42.698 --> 01:26:44.909
Wait. why. 'cause
I called you lady?

1818
01:26:44.992 --> 01:26:46.118
You said the word "trigger."

1819
01:26:46.202 --> 01:26:47.953
It's not a great word
around here these days.

1820
01:26:48.037 --> 01:26:50.789
Oh. you called the pigs.
you fucking stupid...

1821
01:26:50.873 --> 01:26:53.667
Oh. He is a lady.
that's his... Ugh.

1822
01:27:19.777 --> 01:27:21.153
Good luck.

1823
01:27:21.237 --> 01:27:22.238
Bye.

1824
01:27:22.321 --> 01:27:23.739
Oh. Frank.

1825
01:27:23.822 --> 01:27:26.450
So. I can't talk you
out of this. right?

1826
01:27:26.533 --> 01:27:28.202
No. honey. you can't.

1827
01:27:28.285 --> 01:27:29.578
Good.

1828
01:27:29.662 --> 01:27:30.829
More than good.

1829
01:27:48.347 --> 01:27:50.057
Is this Rose?

1830
01:27:51.558 --> 01:27:54.144
Hi Rose. I am Nancy.

1831
01:27:54.228 --> 01:27:55.688
Where's my daddy?

1832
01:27:55.771 --> 01:27:58.357
Your daddy couldn't come.
but he sent me to get you

1833
01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:00.985
and you're going to see
him really. really soon.

1834
01:28:01.068 --> 01:28:03.821
Meanwhile. I'm gonna
be taking care of you.

1835
01:28:03.904 --> 01:28:04.780
Is that all right?

1836
01:28:04.863 --> 01:28:06.031
Is he in jail?

1837
01:28:06.115 --> 01:28:07.950
Sometimes he goes to jail.

1838
01:28:08.033 --> 01:28:11.578
You shouldn't worry about
that. you must be so tired.

1839
01:28:11.662 --> 01:28:13.872
And hungry.
Are you hungry?

1840
01:28:15.666 --> 01:28:17.209
Thank you very much.

1841
01:28:17.293 --> 01:28:20.296
You're so brave that
you came all that way.

1842
01:28:20.379 --> 01:28:21.380
Were you scared?

1843
01:28:21.463 --> 01:28:22.381
A little.

1844
01:28:32.891 --> 01:28:34.643
Turkey. turkey!

1845
01:28:38.856 --> 01:28:41.400
O'Henry once said that
love and family and country

1846
01:28:41.483 --> 01:28:44.570
are nothing but shadows of
words when a man is starving.

1847
01:28:46.071 --> 01:28:47.489
And today. we are not starving.

1848
01:28:47.573 --> 01:28:49.116
I'm glad you're all here.

1849
01:28:49.199 --> 01:28:53.245
O'Henry once said
that love and family and country

1850
01:28:53.329 --> 01:28:55.289
all together is...

1851
01:28:56.457 --> 01:28:57.583
Uh...

1852
01:28:59.626 --> 01:29:00.836
You're right.

1853
01:29:00.919 --> 01:29:02.046
I'm a douche.

1854
01:29:03.839 --> 01:29:05.049
Yes!

1855
01:29:05.132 --> 01:29:09.219
Yes. you most
certainly are a douche.

1856
01:29:11.221 --> 01:29:13.932
And that is the first
step towards recovery.

1857
01:29:14.016 --> 01:29:14.933
Thank you.

1858
01:29:15.017 --> 01:29:17.895
Okay. okay. here we go.

1859
01:29:19.313 --> 01:29:22.816
I'm thankful that we got rid of
our stuck up. useless friends.

1860
01:29:23.692 --> 01:29:26.111
Our new ones
are a little strange.

1861
01:29:26.195 --> 01:29:28.280
but they are true friends.

1862
01:29:29.531 --> 01:29:32.993
I am so thankful that I
married the love of my life

1863
01:29:33.077 --> 01:29:38.082
and that I know my Frank
and I can overcome anything.

1864
01:29:38.165 --> 01:29:40.667
as long as we are together.

1865
01:29:43.128 --> 01:29:44.922
Rose. Rachel?

1866
01:29:45.881 --> 01:29:48.467
Thank god for Baby Ruths.

1867
01:29:50.386 --> 01:29:51.720
Okay. who's hungry?

1868
01:29:51.804 --> 01:29:53.013
Me.

1869
01:29:53.097 --> 01:29:54.181

1873
01:30:02.689 --> 01:30:05.692
Frank and Nancy lived in Jason's
trailer court for a while.

1874
01:30:05.776 --> 01:30:08.320
and Frank took the job
snipping catalytic converters.

1875
01:30:08.404 --> 01:30:09.988
He's pretty darn good at it.

1876
01:30:10.072 --> 01:30:13.325
They rented the house to Carl.
and they all worked night

1877
01:30:13.409 --> 01:30:14.618
and day on YardBay.

1878
01:30:14.701 --> 01:30:17.162
Last time we checked it was
getting pretty darn huge.

1879
01:30:17.246 --> 01:30:20.165
And it all started
when they got drunk.

1880
01:30:20.249 --> 01:30:21.708
And because they were drunk.

1881
01:30:21.792 --> 01:30:23.877
drunk with love
for their daughter.

1882
01:30:23.961 --> 01:30:26.880
And like the saying goes.
a drunk man's actions are

1883
01:30:26.964 --> 01:30:28.549
a sober man's thoughts.

1884
01:30:28.632 --> 01:30:31.427
