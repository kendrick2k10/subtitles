is all I'm saying. man.

00:00:17.452 --> 00:00:18.389
You get backed up like that.

John. how many years ago
did Nichole leave you.

People are starting to talk. man.

13
00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:31.123
and the Pope called last
week to see if you were okay.

14
00:00:31.123 --> 00:00:31.997
- [John] What did you tell him?

15
00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:32.830

What's that. Mrs. Barden?

126
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.029
John stole your socks again?
- Hey. hey. how do I look?

127
00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:40.167
- You look like a lesbian.

128
00:04:40.167 --> 00:04:41.000

00:04:55.286 --> 00:04:56.812
are you still in school?

136
00:04:56.812 --> 00:05:00.215
- Yeah. I took a year off or three.

137
00:05:00.215 --> 00:05:01.332
three years off.

138
00:05:01.332 --> 00:05:02.802

they're away for the summer.

so place to myself. you know.

141

142
00:05:08.735 --> 00:05:10.119
- Sociology.

What are you doing here?

148
00:05:17.946 --> 00:05:19.691
- Oh. it's a long story.

149
00:05:19.691 --> 00:05:21.330
At the last minute the university decided

150
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.172
to void my AP Chem class.

151
00:05:23.172 --> 00:05:24.886
so I needed to get the credit.

152
00:05:24.886 --> 00:05:26.378
get my masters and.

153
00:05:26.378 --> 00:05:27.633
- That sucks. I'm sorry to hear that.

154
00:05:27.633 --> 00:05:28.466
- Yeah. tell me about it.

155
00:05:28.466 --> 00:05:31.045
but they're letting me audit
it here instead of New York.

156
00:05:31.045 --> 00:05:32.169
saves me like 2.000 bucks.

157
00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.764
- Oh. yeah. who's teaching that class?

158
00:05:34.764 --> 00:05:35.889
- Williams.

159
00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:38.009
- Oh my God. dude.

160
00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:40.019
we're in that class too.

161
00:05:40.019 --> 00:05:40.891
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

162
00:05:40.891 --> 00:05:43.237
- Sure. that's why you
missed the first day.

163
00:05:43.237 --> 00:05:46.266
- Well. yeah. I mean we had
some scheduling problems.

164
00:05:46.266 --> 00:05:48.409
so you know. we are
actually on the way to talk

165
00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:50.311
to professor-
- Williams.

166
00:05:50.311 --> 00:05:52.284

- Okay.

175
00:06:07.135 --> 00:06:09.065
- Six years of rehabilitation
down the drain.

176
00:06:09.065 --> 00:06:10.821
- We have to get into Chem. man.

177
00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:12.652
- John. I'm your friend.

178
00:06:12.652 --> 00:06:13.539
let's keep it that way.

179
00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:15.859
- Let's go to Chem. let's go to Chem.

180
00:06:15.859 --> 00:06:17.319
- You're doing that stupid dance

181
00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:18.152
isn't gonna makes me wanna go any faster.

182
00:06:18.152 --> 00:06:19.182
- Let's go to Chem.
- I have it.

183
00:06:19.182 --> 00:06:21.432
it's not gonna help anyone.

184
00:06:24.808 --> 00:06:27.031
- Excuse me. Professor Williams.

185
00:06:27.031 --> 00:06:27.864
- Yeah.

186
00:06:28.725 --> 00:06:30.532
- I'm trying to get into your
advanced chemistry class.

187
00:06:30.532 --> 00:06:33.281
but they won't let me register
without your signature.

188
00:06:33.281 --> 00:06:34.700
- Well. you're a week late.

189
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.853
I'm sorry. I can't catch up now.

190
00:06:36.853 --> 00:06:38.667
You have to wait till
next semester to sign up.

191
00:06:38.667 --> 00:06:40.775
- Right. sorry. we wasted
your time. come on. man.

192
00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:41.885
- No. no. no. no. no.

193
00:06:41.885 --> 00:06:44.008
Sir. my entire future
depends on me getting

194
00:06:44.008 --> 00:06:46.508
into this class this semester.

195
00:06:47.989 --> 00:06:49.245
- You know. this class is no joke.

196
00:06:49.245 --> 00:06:51.162
- And I'm not laughing.

197
00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:54.955
- Okay. what's the atomic weight of Xenon.

198
00:06:54.955 --> 00:06:55.788
- 131.29.

199
00:06:58.224 --> 00:07:00.557
- Wow. welcome to the class.

200
00:07:01.585 --> 00:07:02.457
Catch up on your own.

201
00:07:02.457 --> 00:07:04.970
and we're starting chapter four. Mr?

202
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:06.636
- Barden. John Barden.

203
00:07:06.636 --> 00:07:08.565
and thank you. you're not
gonna regret this really.

204
00:07:08.565 --> 00:07:09.398
Come on.

205
00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:12.951
- Dude. dude. how the
hell did you know that?

206
00:07:12.951 --> 00:07:16.013
- Oh dude. you said I was an
idiot for buying this shirt.

207
00:07:16.013 --> 00:07:17.914
- I said you were an idiot
for buying 20 of those.

208
00:07:17.914 --> 00:07:19.353
- Well. I don't like to do laundry.

209
00:07:19.353 --> 00:07:22.501
(Steve chuckles)

210
00:07:22.501 --> 00:07:24.766
- So anyways. I woke up
and I was like. wait.

211
00:07:24.766 --> 00:07:26.126
that was your dog licking me?

212
00:07:26.126 --> 00:07:27.896
'Cause I definitely thought it was you.

213
00:07:27.896 --> 00:07:29.229
It was so weird.

214
00:07:32.611 --> 00:07:33.892
- Well. all the hallways look the same.

215
00:07:33.892 --> 00:07:35.645
- Hey. are we in the sociology wing?

216
00:07:35.645 --> 00:07:37.179
Cause I don't understand.

217
00:07:37.179 --> 00:07:39.063
- Wait. hold on. let me ask.

218
00:07:39.063 --> 00:07:41.353
Excuse me. oh. ah. sorry.

219
00:07:41.353 --> 00:07:42.540
- Are they meditating in there?

220
00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.139
- Yeah. how do we get into that class?

221
00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:46.100
- Right. couldn't you just
sleep the entire time.

222
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.239
and pass that class?

223
00:07:47.239 --> 00:07:49.752
- I'd get an A plus plus for sure.

224
00:07:49.752 --> 00:07:51.143
(upbeat music)

225
00:07:51.143 --> 00:07:55.918
- Now as you know Sociology is a science.

226
00:07:56.781 --> 00:08:01.154
and there're many times
when the rules of sociology

227
00:08:01.154 --> 00:08:03.063
combine with science.

228
00:08:03.063 --> 00:08:06.480
and one of those would be the incarnation

229
00:08:07.847 --> 00:08:09.930
of the modern "toofbrush."

230
00:08:14.746 --> 00:08:16.246
Boys. you is late.

231
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.236
- We is?

232
00:08:19.236 --> 00:08:20.601
We sorry.

233
00:08:20.601 --> 00:08:22.279
- Yeah. we got stuck in our other class.

234
00:08:22.279 --> 00:08:23.963
the professor held us late.

235
00:08:23.963 --> 00:08:25.963
- And who might that be?

236
00:08:27.444 --> 00:08:32.419
- Professor Defringsdingbergnessner.

237
00:08:33.918 --> 00:08:35.029
- Who?

238
00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:38.112
- Professor Defringsdingbergnessner.

239
00:08:39.024 --> 00:08:41.142
- Defringsdingbergnessner.

240
00:08:41.142 --> 00:08:42.475
Oh. I knows him.

241
00:08:44.419 --> 00:08:45.252
You know what?

242
00:08:45.252 --> 00:08:46.915
I'll have a chat on him later on.

243
00:08:46.915 --> 00:08:48.710
Make sure he don't keep
my boys after anymore.

244
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:49.543
- Oh. thank you very much.

245
00:08:49.543 --> 00:08:51.120
We'd really appreciate that.

246
00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:51.953
- You bet.

247
00:08:52.957 --> 00:08:53.910
- What are your names. boys?

248
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:57.404
I gotta write in roll book over yonder.

249
00:08:57.404 --> 00:08:58.492
- John Barden.

250
00:08:58.492 --> 00:08:59.325
- Steve.

251
00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:03.094
This guy's a complete freaking idiot.

252
00:09:03.094 --> 00:09:05.261
- He's gotta be faking it.

253
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:08.683
- Okay.

254
00:09:12.334 --> 00:09:13.334
Where was I?

255
00:09:14.309 --> 00:09:15.670
- "Toofbrush?"

256
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:18.785
- "Toofbrush." yes. thank you very much.

257
00:09:18.785 --> 00:09:21.399
We need to talk about the "toofbrush."

258
00:09:21.399 --> 00:09:25.658
and its effects on society
as we know it today.

259
00:09:26.978 --> 00:09:28.296
Before we start.

260
00:09:28.296 --> 00:09:32.638
does anybody have any
questions or comments?

261
00:09:32.638 --> 00:09:35.071
Yes. Willie.

262
00:09:36.174 --> 00:09:41.104
- Sure. I think that the
"toofbrush" is a necessary evil.

263
00:09:41.104 --> 00:09:42.922
- Yes. it is.

264
00:09:42.922 --> 00:09:44.614
I believe that too.

265
00:09:44.614 --> 00:09:47.858
The "toofbrush" or mouth stick

266
00:09:47.858 --> 00:09:50.671
as it was called
frequently back in the day

267
00:09:50.671 --> 00:09:55.663
was invented in 1654 by Sir Walter Toof.

268
00:09:59.113 --> 00:09:59.946
- Hey?

269
00:10:00.969 --> 00:10:02.362
What are you doing?

270
00:10:02.362 --> 00:10:03.965
- Taking notes.

271
00:10:03.965 --> 00:10:06.125
Seriously. leave me alone.

272
00:10:06.125 --> 00:10:08.250
I'm trying to get
something from this class.

273
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:09.083
- From this guy.

274
00:10:09.083 --> 00:10:10.066
are you kidding me?

275
00:10:10.066 --> 00:10:12.125
The only thing you're gonna get is lost.

276
00:10:12.125 --> 00:10:14.168
All right. tell you what?

277
00:10:14.168 --> 00:10:16.606
You're better off coming back to my place.

278
00:10:16.606 --> 00:10:18.971
and trying on my mouth stick.

279
00:10:18.971 --> 00:10:20.715
- You are so sick.

280
00:10:20.715 --> 00:10:23.621
- Oh my God. could you
keep it down. please?

281
00:10:23.621 --> 00:10:25.851
Some of us are actually trying
to do well in this class.

282
00:10:25.851 --> 00:10:27.590
- Unbelievable some people.

283
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:30.331
the lack of respect for
a tenured professor.

284
00:10:30.331 --> 00:10:31.164
- Thank you.

285
00:10:31.164 --> 00:10:32.571
Yes. young lady.

286
00:10:32.571 --> 00:10:34.821
please try to keep it down.

287
00:10:36.717 --> 00:10:39.562
Let's get back to the lesson.

288
00:10:39.562 --> 00:10:42.179
Similar to the caste system in India.

289
00:10:42.179 --> 00:10:43.926
the toothbrush made way

290
00:10:43.926 --> 00:10:48.070
for a bunch of advantaged
people here in the new world.

291
00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:49.268
and we could even-

292
00:10:49.268 --> 00:10:52.367
(phone rings)

293
00:10:52.367 --> 00:10:55.700
- Now class. must I repeat myself again?

294
00:10:58.651 --> 00:11:02.883
There is no room for
that gadgetry junk here

295
00:11:02.883 --> 00:11:04.379
here while I am teaching.

296
00:11:04.379 --> 00:11:05.651
not in my classroom.

297
00:11:05.651 --> 00:11:07.885
Sir. come here. give that to me.

298
00:11:07.885 --> 00:11:08.718
Bring that up here.

299
00:11:08.718 --> 00:11:11.058
I will hold your junk
till the end of class.

300
00:11:11.058 --> 00:11:12.464
(John laughs)

301
00:11:12.464 --> 00:11:13.297
- Shut up.

302
00:11:13.297 --> 00:11:14.130
- Come on.

303
00:11:15.705 --> 00:11:17.372
Do not believe this.

304
00:11:18.379 --> 00:11:19.357
Just give me that.

305
00:11:19.357 --> 00:11:20.190
Thank you.

306
00:11:21.629 --> 00:11:24.177
Hmm. she's gotta be cold.

307
00:11:24.177 --> 00:11:25.427
- Was he gentle with your junk?

308
00:11:25.427 --> 00:11:26.971
- Shut the fuck up. John.

309
00:11:26.971 --> 00:11:27.971
- All right.

310
00:11:29.501 --> 00:11:32.264
So they were using towels
for the longest time

311
00:11:32.264 --> 00:11:33.657
before the toothbrush...

312
00:11:33.657 --> 00:11:37.683
(music drowns out professor)

313
00:11:37.683 --> 00:11:40.550

with the finger deep
into your local talents.

321
00:11:58.689 --> 00:12:01.385
That was Phonetic Plumbing with Llarry.

322
00:12:01.385 --> 00:12:03.846
Up next. we got Wood with their hit song.

323

324

327
00:12:17.559 --> 00:12:19.311
Just when I thought I was out.

328
00:12:19.311 --> 00:12:21.478
she pulls me back in boys.

329
00:12:22.339 --> 00:12:24.885
- Oh. did you just quote
"The Godfather" three?

330
00:12:24.885 --> 00:12:28.968
- I think I just died a
little bit on the inside.

331
00:12:29.864 --> 00:12:33.882
- We should get chicken on the way home.

332
00:12:33.882 --> 00:12:35.280
- You guys suck.

333
00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.197

Hello!

353
00:13:21.737 --> 00:13:23.675
- Hi. do you have an application?

354
00:13:23.675 --> 00:13:24.629
- Yes. I do.

355
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:26.149
- I'm Steve. Steve Dillard.

356
00:13:26.149 --> 00:13:26.982
and you are?

357
00:13:26.982 --> 00:13:28.728
- Cindy Pressman.

358
00:13:28.728 --> 00:13:31.015
- And you must be Cindy's sister

359
00:13:31.015 --> 00:13:33.228
- (chuckles) Cindy. I like this one.

360
00:13:33.228 --> 00:13:35.981
Hello. you're a sweet talker. aren't you?

361
00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:36.978

362
00:13:36.978 --> 00:13:38.134

363
00:13:38.134 --> 00:13:40.801
but you can call me aunt Shelly.

364
00:13:41.783 --> 00:13:43.422
- Aunt Shelly.
- Mm-hmm.

365
00:13:43.422 --> 00:13:44.905
- I love it.

366
00:13:44.905 --> 00:13:46.707
- Do you wanna go get that application?

367
00:13:46.707 --> 00:13:48.238
Follow me.

368
00:13:48.238 --> 00:13:49.071
Excuse me.

369
00:13:55.972 --> 00:14:00.821
- Right. everything here looks...

370
00:14:00.821 --> 00:14:04.970
sexy- um... satisfactory.

371
00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:07.062
Unfortunately. they're
gonna make me ask you

372
00:14:07.062 --> 00:14:08.161
a couple of questions.

373
00:14:08.161 --> 00:14:12.643
so I see you are a senior at Olympia.

374
00:14:12.643 --> 00:14:13.660
- Yes.

375
00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:17.217
- Right. so what made
you want to apply here?

376
00:14:17.217 --> 00:14:18.050
- I don't know.

377
00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:19.079
I like movies.

378
00:14:19.079 --> 00:14:20.202
- No way. I do too.

379
00:14:20.202 --> 00:14:21.535
that's so crazy.

380
00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:25.496
I see you have a birthday coming up.

381
00:14:25.496 --> 00:14:28.563
- In two months?
- Yeah. Yeah.

382
00:14:28.563 --> 00:14:32.730
So how do you feel about
fondling. handling money.

383
00:14:34.138 --> 00:14:36.418
like out of the cash registers?

384
00:14:36.418 --> 00:14:37.289
- Okay. I guess.

385
00:14:37.289 --> 00:14:38.223
- Yeah.

386
00:14:38.223 --> 00:14:41.839
You held a lot of other positions?

387
00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:43.379
- Positions?

388
00:14:43.379 --> 00:14:44.937
- Oh jobs. sorry.

389
00:14:44.937 --> 00:14:47.324
- Oh. jobs. I babysat.

390
00:14:47.324 --> 00:14:50.048
- Great. how about weekends?

391
00:14:50.048 --> 00:14:52.468
- Yeah. I used to babysit on the weekends.

392
00:14:52.468 --> 00:14:55.585
- No. like are you free on the weekends?

393
00:14:55.585 --> 00:14:57.770
- Well. not if I'm working.

394
00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:59.603
- Right. you're smart.

395
00:15:00.918 --> 00:15:03.189
Okay. if the phone were to ring right now.

396
00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:05.965
how would you answer it?

397
00:15:05.965 --> 00:15:07.757
- How complicated are your phones?

398
00:15:07.757 --> 00:15:10.174
I've only used normal phones.

399
00:15:11.751 --> 00:15:13.016
- That's an unfair question.

400
00:15:13.016 --> 00:15:14.483
and I'm not gonna ask it again.

401
00:15:14.483 --> 00:15:17.316
- Okay. what about transportation?

402
00:15:18.202 --> 00:15:19.035
- I don't have a car.

403
00:15:19.035 --> 00:15:20.859
but my uncle Zeke could
probably give me a ride.

404
00:15:20.859 --> 00:15:22.442
- Yeah. uncle Zeke.

405
00:15:26.276 --> 00:15:29.454
(blows raspberries) You
are so hired. (laughs)

406
00:15:29.454 --> 00:15:32.559
So when can you start?
- Next weekend?

407
00:15:32.559 --> 00:15:37.559
- Great. how is Saturday at one?

408
00:15:37.604 --> 00:15:39.032
- Great. I'll be here.

409
00:15:39.032 --> 00:15:41.985
- And so will I.

410
00:15:41.985 --> 00:15:44.029
(upbeat music)

411
00:15:44.029 --> 00:15:45.276
I can't wait. it's gonna be so fun.

412
00:15:45.276 --> 00:15:46.348
(Cindy chuckles)

413
00:15:46.348 --> 00:15:47.495
Throwing pop corn at each other.

414
00:15:47.495 --> 00:15:49.210
no. I can't 'cause then
I'll have to clean it up

415
00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:50.991
and I'm not gonna do that.

416
00:15:50.991 --> 00:15:53.574
(upbeat music)

417
00:16:00.164 --> 00:16:01.808
- Hey.

418
00:16:01.808 --> 00:16:03.558
- Wow. you actually made it.

419
00:16:03.558 --> 00:16:04.707
I'm impressed.

420
00:16:04.707 --> 00:16:05.974
How'd you get into this class?

421
00:16:05.974 --> 00:16:09.154
- I've got some dirt on the professor.

422
00:16:09.154 --> 00:16:11.709
- Notebook. textbook. pen?

423
00:16:11.709 --> 00:16:14.209
- You've got all those. right?

424
00:16:17.656 --> 00:16:20.144
- Thank you.
- Some things never change.

425
00:16:20.144 --> 00:16:23.518
- Okay. we'll be starting
with chapter four today;

426
00:16:23.518 --> 00:16:26.495
Self-organization principles of molecules

427
00:16:26.495 --> 00:16:28.218
under extreme pressure.

428
00:16:28.218 --> 00:16:29.575
- I'm glad you're here. John.

429
00:16:29.575 --> 00:16:31.064
It feels so familiar.

430
00:16:31.064 --> 00:16:33.069
- Well. happy to be entertaining you.

431
00:16:33.069 --> 00:16:35.012
We should get together
though after this. you know.

432
00:16:35.012 --> 00:16:37.157
and just catch up and talk.

433
00:16:37.157 --> 00:16:38.030
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

434
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.863
- I'd like that.

435
00:16:38.863 --> 00:16:40.994
- When placed under intense pressure.

436
00:16:40.994 --> 00:16:43.668
These noble gases tend to act like

437
00:16:43.668 --> 00:16:46.251
what other elements Mr. Barden?

438
00:16:48.879 --> 00:16:49.731
- I'm sorry. sir.

439
00:16:49.731 --> 00:16:53.689
I'm actually still getting
acclimated with the material.

440
00:16:53.689 --> 00:16:56.689
- Okay. but no excuses next class.

441
00:16:58.072 --> 00:17:00.655
(upbeat music)

442
00:17:06.873 --> 00:17:10.102
- Okay class. now everyone's
needing to be getting settled.

443
00:17:10.102 --> 00:17:14.163
Now don't forget your
papers is due next class.

444
00:17:14.163 --> 00:17:15.535
so don't forget 'em.

445
00:17:15.535 --> 00:17:19.427
I aims to get 'em graded by the weekend.

446
00:17:19.427 --> 00:17:20.597
Oh good. you're here.

447
00:17:20.597 --> 00:17:22.608
See. I told you guys he'd show up.

448
00:17:22.608 --> 00:17:24.579
They were gonna leave.

449
00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:26.098
- Were some of y'all gonna leave?

450
00:17:26.098 --> 00:17:27.116
- Yeah. well some of them were.

451
00:17:27.116 --> 00:17:28.466
but I stopped them. so.

452
00:17:28.466 --> 00:17:29.883
- Thank you. son.

453
00:17:33.848 --> 00:17:34.816
- Smooth.

454
00:17:34.816 --> 00:17:35.904
- You're such a fucking prick.

455
00:17:35.904 --> 00:17:37.022
you know that?

456
00:17:37.022 --> 00:17:40.309
- Honey. I am the macaroni and the cheese.

457
00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:43.288
(John laughs)

458
00:17:43.288 --> 00:17:46.455
(ambient piano music)

459
00:18:03.414 --> 00:18:05.057
- Hey. you made it.

460
00:18:05.057 --> 00:18:06.798
Let me get you one of these.

461
00:18:06.798 --> 00:18:08.533
- Wow!
- Don't spill.

462
00:18:08.533 --> 00:18:10.499
- This place hasn't changed a bit.

463
00:18:10.499 --> 00:18:11.892
- Are you kidding me?

464
00:18:11.892 --> 00:18:14.058
This place used to be nasty.

465
00:18:14.058 --> 00:18:15.837
There used to be used condoms.

466
00:18:15.837 --> 00:18:18.703
and syringes. and hobos
fucking over there and stuff.

467
00:18:18.703 --> 00:18:20.703
This place looks great now.

468
00:18:20.703 --> 00:18:22.867
- No. I don't remember all of that.

469
00:18:22.867 --> 00:18:25.982
I guess we didn't really
make it out of the backseat.

470
00:18:25.982 --> 00:18:27.615
- This was kind of our spot. huh?

471
00:18:27.615 --> 00:18:29.548
- It's kinda everyone's spot.

472
00:18:29.548 --> 00:18:32.660
Half the girls I know were
here at one point or another.

473
00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.085
- This place is kind of crazy like that.

474
00:18:34.085 --> 00:18:38.048
It's got some sorta wild
sexual vibe about it. you know?

475
00:18:38.048 --> 00:18:39.251
You know the guys around
town actually call it

476
00:18:39.251 --> 00:18:40.386
the pussy vortex.

477
00:18:40.386 --> 00:18:42.287
- That's disgusting.

478
00:18:42.287 --> 00:18:43.970
- Okay. well. by other guys around town.

479
00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:46.303
I actually just mean. Steve.

480
00:18:47.788 --> 00:18:50.837
- Why do you still hang out with him?

481
00:18:50.837 --> 00:18:52.559
- I don't know.

482
00:18:52.559 --> 00:18:54.264
he's a good friend.

483
00:18:54.264 --> 00:18:57.014
He's there. he's there. you know.

484
00:18:57.894 --> 00:19:00.567
- That's something. I guess.

485
00:19:00.567 --> 00:19:04.759
I just thought you'd be
doing something by now.

486
00:19:04.759 --> 00:19:06.794
You had a lot of plans. John.

487
00:19:06.794 --> 00:19:08.044
- Yeah. I know.

488
00:19:09.113 --> 00:19:09.946
I know.

489
00:19:10.824 --> 00:19:12.341
I'm on the radio now.

490
00:19:12.341 --> 00:19:14.999
It's the night shifts for 101.2.

491
00:19:14.999 --> 00:19:16.773
You remember?

492
00:19:16.773 --> 00:19:19.822
I get to play all the
local band's new music

493
00:19:19.822 --> 00:19:21.334
that can't get on during the day.

494
00:19:21.334 --> 00:19:23.841
so I mean. that's cool.

495
00:19:23.841 --> 00:19:24.674
My boss hates me now.

496
00:19:24.674 --> 00:19:26.885
he's a fucking dick.

497
00:19:26.885 --> 00:19:29.136
He just thinks I'm some
sort of a fuck up. you know?

498
00:19:29.136 --> 00:19:33.486
I may be a weirdo. yes.
but I'm not a fuck up.

499
00:19:35.459 --> 00:19:37.692
I'm not where I want to
be at all in my life.

500
00:19:37.692 --> 00:19:40.192
I still got ideas. just...

501
00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.517
Forget it.

502
00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:45.350
What about you.

503
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:47.019
what's new with you.

504
00:19:47.019 --> 00:19:47.892
- I'm engaged.

505
00:19:47.892 --> 00:19:50.093
(record scratches)

506
00:19:50.093 --> 00:19:51.260
- Um. engaged?

507
00:19:52.744 --> 00:19:56.634
- Yep. he's a professor in New York city.

508
00:19:56.634 --> 00:19:58.441
We're not engaged. engaged.

509
00:19:58.441 --> 00:20:02.330
He still has to finalize
his divorce first. but-

510
00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:04.853
- I'm sorry?
- I know how it sounds.

511
00:20:04.853 --> 00:20:06.020
- Okay?
- Okay.

512
00:20:06.886 --> 00:20:08.719
But this is different.

513
00:20:09.853 --> 00:20:11.270
He listens to me.

514
00:20:12.955 --> 00:20:14.835
- Look. all right.

515
00:20:14.835 --> 00:20:16.234
I'm happy you found someone.

516
00:20:16.234 --> 00:20:17.737
Okay. really. I am.

517
00:20:17.737 --> 00:20:18.570
- Thanks.

518
00:20:19.711 --> 00:20:22.005
Most of my friends aren't
very understanding.

519
00:20:22.005 --> 00:20:24.252
- Ah. well. they're probably just thinking

520
00:20:24.252 --> 00:20:27.248
about what they want instead
of what you want. you know.

521
00:20:27.248 --> 00:20:28.560
People can be like that sometimes.

522
00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:29.393
- I know.

523
00:20:31.467 --> 00:20:33.728
Thanks for being supportive.

524
00:20:33.728 --> 00:20:35.395
- Of course. I'm happy for you.

525
00:20:35.395 --> 00:20:36.478
really. I am.

526
00:20:38.944 --> 00:20:40.740
- Oh. well I guess that's it.

527
00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:43.236
You're just gonna have
to move on. that sucks.

528
00:20:43.236 --> 00:20:45.049
There are other fish in the sea though.

529
00:20:45.049 --> 00:20:46.368
- So. shit. man.

530
00:20:46.368 --> 00:20:47.886
I'm still in the game.

531
00:20:47.886 --> 00:20:48.983
It's just the first quarter.

532
00:20:48.983 --> 00:20:51.247
and contrary to popular belief.

533
00:20:51.247 --> 00:20:52.944
I have endurance.

534
00:20:52.944 --> 00:20:54.456
- John. you need to forget

535
00:20:54.456 --> 00:20:56.619
about Nichole completely. all right?

536
00:20:56.619 --> 00:20:58.499
Get yourself a safe girl.

537
00:20:58.499 --> 00:20:59.647
- What like a high school girl?

538
00:20:59.647 --> 00:21:00.544
- Hey. you know what?

539
00:21:00.544 --> 00:21:02.892
Much like this mix of hops and heaven.

540
00:21:02.892 --> 00:21:05.077
It is an acquired taste.

541
00:21:05.077 --> 00:21:05.910
- I don't know. man.

542
00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:09.381
high school girls seem a
little immature for my taste.

543
00:21:09.381 --> 00:21:10.853
- Oh no. oh no. Steve.

544
00:21:10.853 --> 00:21:11.686
Oh no. he's back.

545
00:21:11.686 --> 00:21:14.415
Oh. oh. oh. no. he's attacking me Steve.

546
00:21:14.415 --> 00:21:16.336
Steve. Steve. help me. Steve.

547
00:21:16.336 --> 00:21:18.057
Oh. oh. no!

548
00:21:18.057 --> 00:21:20.640
(upbeat music)

549
00:21:36.096 --> 00:21:36.929
Fuck!

550
00:21:36.929 --> 00:21:37.874
- Jenga. Bitch!

551
00:21:37.874 --> 00:21:40.156
- Oh. don't pretend you didn't like that.

552
00:21:40.156 --> 00:21:42.424
- Asshole.
- Exactly.

553
00:21:42.424 --> 00:21:45.529
Ready to get to your sociology on?

554
00:21:45.529 --> 00:21:46.943
You wrote your paper?

555
00:21:46.943 --> 00:21:48.214
- Not even a little bit.

556
00:21:48.214 --> 00:21:49.279
- You?

557
00:21:49.279 --> 00:21:51.362
- Who are you talking to?

558
00:21:57.181 --> 00:21:58.983
Hi. yes. Professor Robertson.

559
00:21:58.983 --> 00:22:02.479
This is Steve Dillard from class.

560
00:22:02.479 --> 00:22:04.437
No. sir. you don't teach trigonometry.

561
00:22:04.437 --> 00:22:06.864
Your sociology 101 class.

562
00:22:06.864 --> 00:22:09.458
Yeah. yeah. the one that
starts in 20 minutes.

563
00:22:09.458 --> 00:22:10.891
Yeah. I was just calling to let you know

564
00:22:10.891 --> 00:22:14.041
that John Barden and I are not gonna be.

565
00:22:14.041 --> 00:22:15.262
John Barden.

566
00:22:15.262 --> 00:22:16.872
Yeah. yeah. yeah. he's in the class too.

567
00:22:16.872 --> 00:22:18.958
we're both in the class.

568
00:22:18.958 --> 00:22:19.820
I was just calling to let you know

569
00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:21.653
that our grandma died.

570
00:22:22.958 --> 00:22:26.112
So we aren't gonna be able to make it.

571
00:22:26.112 --> 00:22:27.638
Yes. yes. absolutely. sir.

572
00:22:27.638 --> 00:22:29.027
we will get those papers e-mailed

573
00:22:29.027 --> 00:22:31.415
to you the second. the funeral ends.

574
00:22:31.415 --> 00:22:34.457
Thank you so much. Professor Robertson.

575
00:22:34.457 --> 00:22:37.115
- (claps) Well done. Ferris.

576
00:22:37.115 --> 00:22:38.446
Really. good job.

577
00:22:38.446 --> 00:22:40.167
What about my chemistry class?

578
00:22:40.167 --> 00:22:42.161
- I think I have a blank death certificate

579
00:22:42.161 --> 00:22:43.546
you can borrow if you want.

580
00:22:43.546 --> 00:22:45.372
What are you just printing $50 bills

581
00:22:45.372 --> 00:22:48.022
in the basement or something?

582
00:22:48.022 --> 00:22:51.105
- Oh John. you have so much to learn.

583
00:22:54.554 --> 00:22:55.908
- Okay. that was cool.

584
00:22:55.908 --> 00:22:56.966
- Yeah. right.
- That was cool.

585
00:22:56.966 --> 00:22:59.319
- I didn't even think it
was gonna happen like that.

586
00:22:59.319 --> 00:23:00.419
It just kind of did.

587
00:23:00.419 --> 00:23:03.002
(upbeat music)

588
00:23:22.671 --> 00:23:27.671
- And so it was the peer
pressure from the deviant apes

589
00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:32.032
that made the good apes
start smoking the leaves.

590
00:23:32.032 --> 00:23:35.832
And I don't have to tell
you who that precipitated

591
00:23:35.832 --> 00:23:37.499
the human evolution.

592
00:23:38.449 --> 00:23:42.958
(sighs) Guys. you is late again.

593
00:23:42.958 --> 00:23:45.746
What am I gonna do with you?

594
00:23:45.746 --> 00:23:46.579
- Yeah. sorry.

595
00:23:46.579 --> 00:23:49.079
Hey. did you grade our papers?

596
00:23:52.519 --> 00:23:55.491
- Well. apparently you
boys never turned them in.

597
00:23:55.491 --> 00:23:57.783
- Whoa. hey. whoa. well.
we called you remember?

598
00:23:57.783 --> 00:24:00.107
Dead grandma? Grandma's dead.

599
00:24:00.107 --> 00:24:02.687
- Well. wait. wait. wait. wait. you know.

600
00:24:02.687 --> 00:24:04.972
I think I do remember
something about that.

601
00:24:04.972 --> 00:24:07.378
Yeah. it's coming back to me.

602
00:24:07.378 --> 00:24:08.727
- Yeah. yeah. we e-mailed them.

603
00:24:08.727 --> 00:24:10.887
It says right here you got 'em.

604
00:24:10.887 --> 00:24:12.924
- I'm sure they're down in my office.

605
00:24:12.924 --> 00:24:14.684
After class. meet down in my office.

606
00:24:14.684 --> 00:24:16.013
and we'll go over all of this.

607
00:24:16.013 --> 00:24:17.976
we'll get it squared away.
- Yeah.

608
00:24:17.976 --> 00:24:18.969
- Thank you. boys.

609
00:24:18.969 --> 00:24:19.958
(both chuckling)

610
00:24:19.958 --> 00:24:20.791
- Wow!

611
00:24:20.791 --> 00:24:24.146
- So let's get back now to our lesson.

612
00:24:24.146 --> 00:24:25.696
You say it's evolution.

613
00:24:25.696 --> 00:24:27.478
Some say it's evolution.

614
00:24:27.478 --> 00:24:29.735
I just say it's lution.

615
00:24:29.735 --> 00:24:31.019
Doesn't matter.

616
00:24:31.019 --> 00:24:32.506
Lution is lution.

617
00:24:32.506 --> 00:24:34.117
- Sort of one of going that night.

618
00:24:34.117 --> 00:24:36.327
but then I found out that
they brought in like a midget.

619
00:24:36.327 --> 00:24:39.322
and a flame thrower and it was so hot.

620
00:24:39.322 --> 00:24:40.239
- Oh!
- Wow!

621
00:24:41.743 --> 00:24:43.772
- What the fuck?
- Oh!

622
00:24:43.772 --> 00:24:44.605
- Oh hey.
- Oh. wait. wait.

623
00:24:44.605 --> 00:24:45.686
what the hell are you guys doing here?

624
00:24:45.686 --> 00:24:47.640
Shouldn't you be playing
like Frogger or something?

625
00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:51.872
- Oh. we're looking for
the psychology department.

626
00:24:51.872 --> 00:24:53.275
- Yeah. yeah. they're paying five bucks

627
00:24:53.275 --> 00:24:54.957
for some negative reinforcement testing.

628
00:24:54.957 --> 00:24:56.343
and oh. we're hungry.

629
00:24:56.343 --> 00:24:57.529
- $5 foot long day.

630
00:24:57.529 --> 00:24:59.718
- Mm. $5 foot long.

631
00:24:59.718 --> 00:25:01.541
- You know. all right. whatever. guys.

632
00:25:01.541 --> 00:25:03.181
I'll see you back at my house

633
00:25:03.181 --> 00:25:04.223
- Yeah. yeah.
- Yeah. yeah.

634
00:25:04.223 --> 00:25:05.056
- Yeah. awesome.

635
00:25:05.056 --> 00:25:06.200
All right. so shoo!

636
00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.200
- Thank you.

637
00:25:09.041 --> 00:25:10.930
- You know I didn't know
their asses weren't cemented

638
00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:11.946
to your couch cushion.

639
00:25:11.946 --> 00:25:14.320
so that's pretty weird.

640
00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.618
(John knocks)

641
00:25:15.618 --> 00:25:17.419
- Who's there?

642
00:25:17.419 --> 00:25:18.675
- John.
- Come in.

643
00:25:18.675 --> 00:25:20.171
- Steve.
- Well. come in.

644
00:25:20.171 --> 00:25:21.842
Yeah. it's like the joke. knock. knock.

645
00:25:21.842 --> 00:25:23.402
and then I said who's there.

646
00:25:23.402 --> 00:25:24.235
- Oh!
- Oh.

647
00:25:26.347 --> 00:25:28.734
- Hi. what can I do you for?

648
00:25:28.734 --> 00:25:31.155
- Did you find our papers yet?

649
00:25:31.155 --> 00:25:32.413
- No.

650
00:25:32.413 --> 00:25:36.156
Good. I know it is here somewhere.

651
00:25:36.156 --> 00:25:36.989
I had it.

652
00:25:36.989 --> 00:25:38.705
It's messy here.

653
00:25:40.321 --> 00:25:43.746
- Do you need us to resend them?

654
00:25:43.746 --> 00:25:45.989
- No. no. no. no. this is my fault.

655
00:25:45.989 --> 00:25:47.189
This is all my fault.

656
00:25:47.189 --> 00:25:50.058
It is. I've been busy and you know.

657
00:25:50.058 --> 00:25:51.320
and you. I remember yours.

658
00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.193
it was a good paper.

659
00:25:52.193 --> 00:25:53.981
you did a good job.

660
00:25:53.981 --> 00:25:55.676
a very good job.

661
00:25:55.676 --> 00:25:56.625
You know what?

662
00:25:56.625 --> 00:25:58.856
Let's just cut to the otters head.

663
00:25:58.856 --> 00:26:00.523
and what do you say?

664
00:26:03.564 --> 00:26:05.870
We'll give you a 98.

665
00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:06.787
98 for you.

666
00:26:07.723 --> 00:26:10.229
and for you a 98. right?

667
00:26:10.229 --> 00:26:12.280
- Oh no. no. no. mine
wasn't as good as his.

668
00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.150
- You're right. 81. 81.

669
00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:14.985
We'll just do that.

670
00:26:14.985 --> 00:26:15.818
that's a B.

671
00:26:15.818 --> 00:26:16.651
and B is good.

672
00:26:16.651 --> 00:26:17.484
I like B.

673
00:26:18.822 --> 00:26:20.541
Well. you know. I do
appreciate your waiting.

674
00:26:20.541 --> 00:26:22.547
and again. I do apologize for this.

675
00:26:22.547 --> 00:26:24.336
Sometimes. you know. this comes up.

676
00:26:24.336 --> 00:26:26.617
and it's piling up higher and higher.

677
00:26:26.617 --> 00:26:29.542
and I know that somewhere
inside here I have.

678
00:26:29.542 --> 00:26:31.146
I know it's here. but.

679
00:26:31.146 --> 00:26:31.979
- No. no. no. no.

680
00:26:31.979 --> 00:26:33.573
Hey. hey. our grandma's
shouldn't have died.

681
00:26:33.573 --> 00:26:35.582
- No. she shouldn't have.
- What an idiot. right?

682
00:26:35.582 --> 00:26:37.382
- You know. I just. you know. you can't.

683
00:26:37.382 --> 00:26:38.419
it's not her fault.

684
00:26:38.419 --> 00:26:40.387
but it kinda is.
- A little. a little.

685
00:26:40.387 --> 00:26:41.600
- They can plan a little better.

686
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.633
Why don't you get out of here now?

687
00:26:42.633 --> 00:26:44.685
Because I got some lots of stuff to do.

688
00:26:44.685 --> 00:26:46.521
and I gotta find another paper.

689
00:26:46.521 --> 00:26:47.377
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

690
00:26:47.377 --> 00:26:48.372
- All right. and you take care now.

691
00:26:48.372 --> 00:26:51.076
Whoa. one of you guys
dropped a deuce or something?

692
00:26:51.076 --> 00:26:55.752
- (laughs) and ah. I win.
- What?

693
00:26:55.752 --> 00:26:57.225
- I am the best.
- Fucking cheater.

694
00:26:57.225 --> 00:26:58.094
that's what you are.

695
00:26:58.094 --> 00:27:00.106
- I get the mozzarella stick here.

696
00:27:00.106 --> 00:27:01.618
- Oh. bullshit.

697
00:27:01.618 --> 00:27:02.955
Pick up a joy and let's go again.

698
00:27:02.955 --> 00:27:04.556
- Smells like victory.
- Again.

699
00:27:04.556 --> 00:27:05.595
- Run it back!

700
00:27:05.595 --> 00:27:08.178
(upbeat music)

701
00:27:09.449 --> 00:27:11.620
- Okay. so when a new movie comes in.

702
00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:13.630
it comes in on one of these hard drives.

703
00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:14.639
You know. it's not like the old days

704
00:27:14.639 --> 00:27:16.708
where it came in on multiple reels.

705
00:27:16.708 --> 00:27:19.266
you had to splice the film together.

706
00:27:19.266 --> 00:27:20.410
Okay. whatever.

707
00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:22.635
So anyways. when a new movie comes in.

708
00:27:22.635 --> 00:27:23.736
you come over here.

709
00:27:23.736 --> 00:27:26.014
take out the old hard drive.

710
00:27:26.014 --> 00:27:28.261
put the new one in.

711
00:27:28.261 --> 00:27:29.594
and slide it in.

712
00:27:31.723 --> 00:27:32.893
- I can't see.

713
00:27:32.893 --> 00:27:35.950
Oh. all right. well. come over this way.

714
00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:38.950
(sensual music)

715
00:27:40.774 --> 00:27:44.379
- Yeah. so you. sorry. where was I?

716
00:27:44.379 --> 00:27:46.480
- Sliding it in.

717
00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.540
- What?

718
00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:49.485
- The hard drive.

719
00:27:49.485 --> 00:27:50.652
Oh. all right.

720
00:27:53.286 --> 00:27:54.772
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

721
00:27:54.772 --> 00:27:57.355
(sensual music)

722
00:28:02.344 --> 00:28:03.407
- Frank. get off of him. dude.

723
00:28:03.407 --> 00:28:06.021
- Oh my God. I think my
fucking spleen just ruptured.

724
00:28:06.021 --> 00:28:06.938
- Oh. baby.

725
00:28:08.058 --> 00:28:10.562
- Well. anyway I am getting
the 'cuda back tomorrow.

726
00:28:10.562 --> 00:28:11.447
- No shit!

727
00:28:11.447 --> 00:28:12.280
- Yeah.
- It's about time. man.

728
00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:13.113
- I know you're telling me.

729
00:28:13.113 --> 00:28:15.880
I'm about to be cruising
like all day on Monday.

730
00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:16.991
- Wait. what's Monday?

731
00:28:16.991 --> 00:28:18.121
Is it Arbor day?

732
00:28:18.121 --> 00:28:19.986
- Monday. my friend is what
in high school is referred

733
00:28:19.986 --> 00:28:21.796
to as a half day.

734
00:28:21.796 --> 00:28:23.019
so it'd be sacrilege not

735
00:28:23.019 --> 00:28:25.077
to take advantage of that. right?

736
00:28:25.077 --> 00:28:26.274
- What about the.

737
00:28:26.274 --> 00:28:27.671
what's her name.

738
00:28:27.671 --> 00:28:29.252
the new hottie at work?

739
00:28:29.252 --> 00:28:30.328
- Oh yeah. no. I don't know

740
00:28:30.328 --> 00:28:32.473
if that one's gonna work out this time.

741
00:28:32.473 --> 00:28:33.948
- It's never stopped you before.

742
00:28:33.948 --> 00:28:35.379
- Yeah. but I keep getting older. okay?

743
00:28:35.379 --> 00:28:37.483
I'm gonna get caught pretty soon.

744
00:28:37.483 --> 00:28:38.625
- So don't do it.

745
00:28:38.625 --> 00:28:40.647
- Yeah. okay. you've obviously never seen

746
00:28:40.647 --> 00:28:41.836
this chick before. all right?

747
00:28:41.836 --> 00:28:44.130
You don't say no to a girl like this.

748
00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:45.630
- Ah. you don't.

749
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:46.463
(John laughs)

750
00:28:46.463 --> 00:28:48.552
- All right. yeah. whatever. I don't.

751
00:28:48.552 --> 00:28:51.754
She's not like your average
high school girl. you know?

752
00:28:51.754 --> 00:28:54.726
- What is she advanced?
- Homeschooled?

753
00:28:54.726 --> 00:28:56.010
- No. she's in high school.

754
00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:57.510
I just mean she's.

755
00:28:58.448 --> 00:29:00.612
fuck. I don't know. she's
different. all right?

756
00:29:00.612 --> 00:29:02.868
- But isn't that what
you said about Sarah?

757
00:29:02.868 --> 00:29:04.253
- Yeah. I did say that about Sarah.

758
00:29:04.253 --> 00:29:07.616
but what I met with Sarah's
a fucking psychopath. okay?

759
00:29:07.616 --> 00:29:09.635
- Didn't you date her for like six months?

760
00:29:09.635 --> 00:29:10.569
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I did.

761
00:29:10.569 --> 00:29:12.810
and it was the worst six
months of my life actually.

762
00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:14.092
It was the best sex though.

763
00:29:14.092 --> 00:29:16.831
so I guess in retrospect. it's kinda.

764
00:29:16.831 --> 00:29:19.056
- Whatever happened with that?

765
00:29:19.056 --> 00:29:20.080
- She turned 18.

766
00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.114
I had to cut her loose.

767
00:29:21.114 --> 00:29:23.303
- For Christ's sake. would you
just snap the freaking ball?

768
00:29:23.303 --> 00:29:24.415
- All right.
- Oh. somebody wants

769
00:29:24.415 --> 00:29:26.353
to get to get scored on.

770
00:29:26.353 --> 00:29:27.760
- Okay. okay. I'm coming for you.

771
00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.315
- Yeah.

772
00:29:29.315 --> 00:29:30.148
- Hut!

773
00:29:31.324 --> 00:29:32.490
Oh. there he is.

774
00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:34.078
Oh drop.

775
00:29:34.078 --> 00:29:35.248
- Through the trees!
- Yes!

776
00:29:35.248 --> 00:29:36.609
- In your face. Bob.

777
00:29:36.609 --> 00:29:37.442
Touch down.

778
00:29:37.442 --> 00:29:38.702
- Still got it.

779
00:29:38.702 --> 00:29:40.331
Yeah. you saw that.

780
00:29:40.331 --> 00:29:42.914
(upbeat music)

781
00:29:43.993 --> 00:29:46.410
(indistinct)

782
00:29:48.728 --> 00:29:50.089
- [Professor] There
will be previously seen

783
00:29:50.089 --> 00:29:52.288
in their individual elements

784
00:29:52.288 --> 00:29:56.538
which reaction means (indistinct).

785
00:29:57.968 --> 00:29:58.801
- John?

786
00:30:00.662 --> 00:30:02.579
- An answer Mr. Barden.

787
00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:04.513
- Seven.

788
00:30:05.439 --> 00:30:06.955
- Yeah. very good.

789
00:30:06.955 --> 00:30:10.525
In this way conversion of this
group introduced is stable.

790
00:30:10.525 --> 00:30:14.275
(music drowns out professor)

791
00:30:23.862 --> 00:30:26.779
(triumphant music)

792
00:30:35.655 --> 00:30:38.655
(garage door opens)

793
00:30:46.417 --> 00:30:48.834
(door opens)

794
00:30:53.359 --> 00:30:54.192
- Is he here?

795
00:30:54.192 --> 00:30:55.196
- Yeah. yeah. he's upfront.

796
00:30:55.196 --> 00:30:56.728
and he didn't take his pills today.

797
00:30:56.728 --> 00:30:58.537
- Oh. this is gonna be so ripe.

798
00:30:58.537 --> 00:31:00.067
- Yeah. no shit. dude.

799
00:31:00.067 --> 00:31:01.567
Oh. here he comes.

800
00:31:04.868 --> 00:31:06.741
- Oh. good morning. class.

801
00:31:06.741 --> 00:31:10.629
- [All] Good morning Professor Robertson.

802
00:31:10.629 --> 00:31:11.462
- Yeah.

803
00:31:12.835 --> 00:31:17.295
Today. we needs to talk
about the impact of marriage

804
00:31:17.295 --> 00:31:18.884
in our social system.

805
00:31:18.884 --> 00:31:20.938
Before we's get started.

806
00:31:20.938 --> 00:31:24.021
anyone have any questions or comments.

807
00:31:24.918 --> 00:31:26.085
- Yes. Daniel.

808
00:31:28.047 --> 00:31:31.097
- Sure. marriage is good.

809
00:31:32.962 --> 00:31:34.982
- Well. yes it is.

810
00:31:34.982 --> 00:31:37.784
Thank you for participating.

811
00:31:37.784 --> 00:31:41.523
Marriage is the coming of
two people in a relationship

812
00:31:41.523 --> 00:31:42.685
in a social setting.

813
00:31:42.685 --> 00:31:45.563
or three or four people.
depending on where you live.

814
00:31:45.563 --> 00:31:49.646
like if you live near Utah
or something like that

815
00:31:50.833 --> 00:31:52.660
then it's a whole different story.

816
00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:55.403
but a whole lot more fun.

817
00:31:55.403 --> 00:31:56.653
Let me explain.

818
00:31:58.222 --> 00:32:01.889
Does anyone here know
someone who's married?

819
00:32:03.556 --> 00:32:05.507
Good. good. good. good.

820
00:32:05.507 --> 00:32:06.685
See. in marriage though.

821
00:32:06.685 --> 00:32:08.426
you think you know what it's about.

822
00:32:08.426 --> 00:32:09.995
you do not.

823
00:32:09.995 --> 00:32:12.014
'Cause you see marriage.

824
00:32:12.014 --> 00:32:13.300
it's a scam.

825
00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.639
It's a scam from big
business just to get people

826
00:32:15.639 --> 00:32:18.371
to start marriaging together.

827
00:32:18.371 --> 00:32:20.267
It's really to get people to spend money.

828
00:32:20.267 --> 00:32:21.294
It's a commercial thing.

829
00:32:21.294 --> 00:32:25.544
It really example. again.
i.e. dot. dot. dot. colon.

830
00:32:26.755 --> 00:32:27.977
You would buy a towel.

831
00:32:27.977 --> 00:32:29.317
then you'd buy towels.

832
00:32:29.317 --> 00:32:31.673
and now you buy his and hers towels.

833
00:32:31.673 --> 00:32:33.109
so that you've got to spend more money.

834
00:32:33.109 --> 00:32:35.256
and then it just gets a
little bit crazy. doesn't it?

835
00:32:35.256 --> 00:32:36.509
I think it does.

836
00:32:36.509 --> 00:32:37.759
It really does.

837
00:32:39.865 --> 00:32:44.282
- Another thing. who here
has ever seen a phone book?

838
00:32:45.831 --> 00:32:46.969
Okay. all right.

839
00:32:46.969 --> 00:32:49.845
Now in the phone book. you'll notice

840
00:32:49.845 --> 00:32:51.064
that you've got like Smith.

841
00:32:51.064 --> 00:32:52.487
and the names in the phone book.

842
00:32:52.487 --> 00:32:53.434
all different kinds of names.

843
00:32:53.434 --> 00:32:54.267
and it's Smith.

844
00:32:54.267 --> 00:32:55.100
and then you'd get Jones.

845
00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:56.390
and of course not on the same page.

846
00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:58.993
'cause that would either
be a very. very small town

847
00:32:58.993 --> 00:33:00.099
which isn't a bad thing.

848
00:33:00.099 --> 00:33:01.618
'cause I miss mine.

849
00:33:01.618 --> 00:33:04.077
But also you think about it.

850
00:33:04.077 --> 00:33:05.666
and it would be Smith Jones.

851
00:33:05.666 --> 00:33:09.535
and then they would have
a hyphen Smith-Jones.

852
00:33:09.535 --> 00:33:11.380
'cause people get married
and wanna keep their names.

853
00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:13.018
but then it's just one name.

854
00:33:13.018 --> 00:33:14.926
and then it just goes by Jones.

855
00:33:14.926 --> 00:33:15.759
You see what I'm.

856
00:33:15.759 --> 00:33:18.592
do you understand what I'm saying?

857
00:33:20.131 --> 00:33:22.714
Does anyone have any questions?

858
00:33:23.885 --> 00:33:25.857
- Gregory. yes.

859
00:33:25.857 --> 00:33:27.342
- I'm not in this class.

860
00:33:27.342 --> 00:33:28.425
- You is now.

861
00:33:29.828 --> 00:33:32.085
- I have an unrelated question.

862
00:33:32.085 --> 00:33:34.369
- There is no unrelated questions

863
00:33:34.369 --> 00:33:36.705
when it comes to sociology.

864
00:33:36.705 --> 00:33:39.383
- Fantastic. 'cause I was wondering

865
00:33:39.383 --> 00:33:41.852
what the fuck is wrong with you?

866
00:33:41.852 --> 00:33:45.438
Do you have any idea what
you're talking about?

867
00:33:45.438 --> 00:33:48.650
- That would really be two questions.

868
00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:50.831
- Okay. hello people.

869
00:33:50.831 --> 00:33:52.944
are you buying this bullshit?

870
00:33:52.944 --> 00:33:56.424
Go home. watch cartoons or something.

871
00:33:56.424 --> 00:33:57.811
anything but this.

872
00:33:57.811 --> 00:33:58.644
Jesus!

873
00:34:00.758 --> 00:34:03.175
(door opens)

874
00:34:04.105 --> 00:34:08.480
- And that class is why some
people will never get married.

875
00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.032
'cause it's an anger issue.

876
00:34:10.032 --> 00:34:11.804
It's an anger issue.

877
00:34:11.804 --> 00:34:13.127
It is a bad thing.

878
00:34:13.127 --> 00:34:15.212
Does anyone else have any other questions?

879
00:34:15.212 --> 00:34:17.281
(upbeat music)

880
00:34:17.281 --> 00:34:18.114
- I don't know.

881
00:34:18.114 --> 00:34:19.488
it was just kinda sad really.

882
00:34:19.488 --> 00:34:20.754
- Robertson just like brushed it off.

883
00:34:20.754 --> 00:34:22.150
He probably didn't even hear it.

884
00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:25.017
- Yeah. I guess it helps
to be off planet anyways.

885
00:34:25.017 --> 00:34:26.872
- I wonder what it's
like to be off planet.

886
00:34:26.872 --> 00:34:28.858
- I always thought it
would be like "Star Wars?"

887
00:34:28.858 --> 00:34:30.210
But that takes place in the past. so-

888
00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:31.630
- As long as it's not like Aliens

889
00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:32.699
that's all I care about.

890
00:34:32.699 --> 00:34:34.104
(upbeat music)

891
00:34:34.104 --> 00:34:35.619
So you and new girl going out tonight?

892
00:34:35.619 --> 00:34:37.174
- Yeah. second date.

893
00:34:37.174 --> 00:34:38.537
I better get a piece
of ass this time. man.

894
00:34:38.537 --> 00:34:41.114
She's such a goddamn cock tease.

895
00:34:41.114 --> 00:34:43.722
- Whoa. okay. maybe she's
just a virgin though.

896
00:34:43.722 --> 00:34:44.585
- No. there's no way.

897
00:34:44.585 --> 00:34:46.628
she's way too hot for that.

898
00:34:46.628 --> 00:34:48.296
Besides I swore off virgins.

899
00:34:48.296 --> 00:34:50.188
- It seems awfully out
of character for you.

900
00:34:50.188 --> 00:34:51.021
- No. no. no. no. no.

901
00:34:51.021 --> 00:34:53.311
look there's like an associated smell

902
00:34:53.311 --> 00:34:55.535
with the taking of a girl's virginity.

903
00:34:55.535 --> 00:34:57.891
Yeah. it's disgusting you
can't get it out of the car.

904
00:34:57.891 --> 00:34:59.906
I'm not putting the 'cuda
through that shit again.

905
00:34:59.906 --> 00:35:01.588
- That's messed up dude.

906
00:35:01.588 --> 00:35:02.770
- Anyways I have a new rule about that.

907
00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:04.586
I wait for somebody else
to break them in first.

908
00:35:04.586 --> 00:35:08.002
you know. a boyfriend. uncle. whenever.

909
00:35:08.002 --> 00:35:09.324
- You got fucking problems. man.

910
00:35:09.324 --> 00:35:10.574
- Yes. I do.

911
00:35:10.574 --> 00:35:12.190
- So what are you coming over?

912
00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:13.260
- Yeah. where else would I go?

913
00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:15.990
- I don't know. home. library. playground.

914
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:18.420
We all know how Steve
likes the playgrounds.

915
00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:21.003
(upbeat music)

916
00:35:25.849 --> 00:35:28.682
(car engine revs)

917
00:35:45.313 --> 00:35:48.313
(sensual music)

918
00:36:04.838 --> 00:36:06.346
(van engine revs)

919
00:36:06.346 --> 00:36:08.929
(upbeat music)

920
00:37:12.304 --> 00:37:14.064
- And I totally didn't
expect this to happen.

921
00:37:14.064 --> 00:37:17.314
I mean. he's still married to his wife.

922
00:37:18.536 --> 00:37:20.322
She just thinks that he's
gonna like leave his family

923
00:37:20.322 --> 00:37:22.155
and run away with her.

924
00:37:23.378 --> 00:37:25.071
How do I even spin that?

925
00:37:25.071 --> 00:37:26.628
- It's gotta be tough.

926
00:37:26.628 --> 00:37:28.300
Girls who go for older guys.

927
00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:30.100
they don't like to come back.

928
00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:32.897
- What exactly do you wanna do here?

929
00:37:32.897 --> 00:37:34.974
- I just want them out of
the way out of the way.

930
00:37:34.974 --> 00:37:38.226
- Out of the way or out of the way?

931
00:37:38.226 --> 00:37:41.314
- Come on. man. we don't have to kill him.

932
00:37:41.314 --> 00:37:42.598
Do we?

933
00:37:42.598 --> 00:37:43.431
- No.

934
00:37:44.637 --> 00:37:47.780
No. no. you bunch of idiots. no. okay.

935
00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:49.872
but he is pissing me off. all right?

936
00:37:49.872 --> 00:37:51.296
I mean. he's just using her.

937
00:37:51.296 --> 00:37:53.640
and she just has no idea.

938
00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:54.473
- We could scare him off.

939
00:37:54.473 --> 00:37:56.316
rough him up a little bit.

940
00:37:56.316 --> 00:37:57.794
- Yeah. but then what if it doesn't hold.

941
00:37:57.794 --> 00:38:00.005
and he sticks around anyway.

942
00:38:00.005 --> 00:38:02.050
- Could rough her up a little bit.

943
00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:03.539
- No.

944
00:38:03.539 --> 00:38:05.208
- We can take pictures
of him with a chick.

945
00:38:05.208 --> 00:38:06.041
- With Nichole.

946
00:38:06.041 --> 00:38:07.704
- Yeah. and then send to his wife.

947
00:38:07.704 --> 00:38:09.238
and then he has to choose upfront.

948
00:38:09.238 --> 00:38:10.634
- Yeah. but then when
if he chooses Nichole.

949
00:38:10.634 --> 00:38:13.949
and I'm even more screwed
than I was at first.

950
00:38:13.949 --> 00:38:17.789
- Okay. okay. so find some ho-bag.

951
00:38:17.789 --> 00:38:20.537
you know. some other
chick to sleep with him.

952
00:38:20.537 --> 00:38:22.979
- You're telling me that you're
planning to get me laid is

953
00:38:22.979 --> 00:38:26.932
to hire some whore to have
sex with somebody else.

954
00:38:26.932 --> 00:38:27.988
- Yes.

955
00:38:27.988 --> 00:38:29.766
- Not your best plan.

956
00:38:29.766 --> 00:38:31.288
- Man. forget all that.

957
00:38:31.288 --> 00:38:34.170
This type of guy is probably
a real scumbag already.

958
00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:35.021
Nichole is a bright girl.

959
00:38:35.021 --> 00:38:36.614
she'll come around eventually.

960
00:38:36.614 --> 00:38:38.229
- So what. like I just do nothing?

961
00:38:38.229 --> 00:38:40.787
- No. no. no. keep going after her.

962
00:38:40.787 --> 00:38:42.996
but there's no reason
to cock block this guy.

963
00:38:42.996 --> 00:38:45.418
he'll end up fucking himself eventually.

964
00:38:45.418 --> 00:38:46.251
- I don't know. man.

965
00:38:46.251 --> 00:38:48.777
it just doesn't seem
like enough. you know?

966
00:38:48.777 --> 00:38:51.418
- Okay. well. what other
choice do you have?

967
00:38:51.418 --> 00:38:53.155
- None. okay. none. fine.

968
00:38:53.155 --> 00:38:54.460
Fuck you guys. okay.

969
00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:56.674
Are you guys coming over or what?

970
00:38:56.674 --> 00:38:57.811
- Is your mom gonna be there?

971
00:38:57.811 --> 00:38:59.309
- No. she's been gone all summer. man.

972
00:38:59.309 --> 00:39:01.368
but she made lasagna.

973
00:39:01.368 --> 00:39:02.421
four months ago.

974
00:39:02.421 --> 00:39:03.254
it's in the freezer.

975
00:39:03.254 --> 00:39:04.749
and I'ma heat that shit up.

976
00:39:04.749 --> 00:39:05.812
- [Frank] Still good.

977
00:39:05.812 --> 00:39:08.395
(upbeat music)

978
00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:16.737
- Hello?
- Hey.

979
00:39:17.632 --> 00:39:20.162
- Who's this?
- It's John.

980
00:39:20.162 --> 00:39:23.337
You told me to call.
- Oh. hi.

981
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:26.830
- Something wrong?

982
00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:29.495
You were supposed to go to
New York this weekend. right?

983
00:39:29.495 --> 00:39:33.059
- [Nichole] Nigel says he's
too busy to see me. prick.

984
00:39:33.059 --> 00:39:36.694
I think he's seeing his
wife behind my back.

985
00:39:36.694 --> 00:39:38.111
- That's too bad.

986
00:39:40.179 --> 00:39:41.709
- [Nichole] We should get together.

987
00:39:41.709 --> 00:39:43.643
Dinner this weekend?

988
00:39:43.643 --> 00:39:46.562
- Yeah. sure.
- Sounds great.

989
00:39:46.562 --> 00:39:47.909
Make some plans and call me.

990
00:39:47.909 --> 00:39:48.770
- Yeah. for sure.

991
00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:49.603
I will do.

992
00:39:50.803 --> 00:39:54.257
(John chuckles)

993
00:39:54.257 --> 00:39:55.507
Woo. all right!

994
00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:01.623
- [Steve] How was your call?

995
00:40:01.623 --> 00:40:03.884
- Going out with Nichole this weekend.

996
00:40:03.884 --> 00:40:06.945
Dinner.
- Nice man. good luck.

997
00:40:06.945 --> 00:40:09.679
- You're pissing in your own face. man.

998
00:40:09.679 --> 00:40:11.766
- What about the fiancé?

999
00:40:11.766 --> 00:40:14.393
- Still with his wife.

1000
00:40:14.393 --> 00:40:15.982
- Good. very stable.

1001
00:40:15.982 --> 00:40:18.739
- Look who is talking. man.

1002
00:40:18.739 --> 00:40:21.542
- That actually reminds me.
ah. (blows raspberries).

1003
00:40:21.542 --> 00:40:22.599
(Frank and Bob laugh)

1004
00:40:22.599 --> 00:40:23.921
- [John] Shut up.

1005
00:40:23.921 --> 00:40:26.338
(upbeat music)

1006
00:40:28.298 --> 00:40:29.765
- I gotta manscape.

1007
00:40:29.765 --> 00:40:31.071
Got a date later.

1008
00:40:31.071 --> 00:40:32.725
- Yeah. what's his name?

1009
00:40:32.725 --> 00:40:33.558
- Lucy.

1010
00:40:34.938 --> 00:40:36.844
- Isn't that your mom's name?

1011
00:40:36.844 --> 00:40:38.383
- It's okay. my mom's not in high school.

1012
00:40:38.383 --> 00:40:40.533
(John laughs)

1013
00:40:40.533 --> 00:40:41.584
- That's really fucking funny. dude.

1014
00:40:41.584 --> 00:40:44.001
(all laugh)

1015
00:40:46.902 --> 00:40:49.319
(beer pours)

1016
00:40:52.242 --> 00:40:55.097
- Wow. there's my little heartbreaker.

1017
00:40:55.097 --> 00:40:58.707
Hey. come on and give your uncle
a little kiss now. come on.

1018
00:40:58.707 --> 00:40:59.715
(Zeke and Shelly laughing)

1019
00:40:59.715 --> 00:41:02.383
- Uncle Zeke. I just put my lips on.

1020
00:41:02.383 --> 00:41:03.518
- Cindy Starlight Pressman.

1021
00:41:03.518 --> 00:41:05.623
don't you dare sass your uncle.

1022
00:41:05.623 --> 00:41:06.934
- Sorry. aunt Shelly.

1023
00:41:06.934 --> 00:41:08.175
- Are you having some dinner.

1024
00:41:08.175 --> 00:41:09.856
or are you still watching your figure?

1025
00:41:09.856 --> 00:41:12.689
- I'll watch your figure for you.

1026
00:41:12.689 --> 00:41:14.211
- Nothing for me. thanks.

1027
00:41:14.211 --> 00:41:15.784
I'm going out with Steve tonight.

1028
00:41:15.784 --> 00:41:18.676
- Oh yeah. I don't know what I think

1029
00:41:18.676 --> 00:41:20.607
about this Steve character. huh?

1030
00:41:20.607 --> 00:41:23.153
What are you working in that
flicker shack for. huh anyway?

1031
00:41:23.153 --> 00:41:24.391
You smell like popcorn.

1032
00:41:24.391 --> 00:41:26.189
and you're hardly making anything.

1033
00:41:26.189 --> 00:41:27.022
I told you.

1034
00:41:27.022 --> 00:41:28.396
you want to make some real money

1035
00:41:28.396 --> 00:41:30.660
you gotta go down there
and audition for the Kat.

1036
00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:33.458
- Mm-mh. now Zeke. that
place closed down last year.

1037
00:41:33.458 --> 00:41:34.291
- Oh what?

1038
00:41:34.291 --> 00:41:35.413
Oh shit!
- Yeah. I know.

1039
00:41:35.413 --> 00:41:37.911
- That's where me and our aunt Shelly met.

1040
00:41:37.911 --> 00:41:39.744
She was B squad.

1041
00:41:39.744 --> 00:41:41.416
but I'll tell you she would
have been center stage

1042
00:41:41.416 --> 00:41:44.671
Friday night had I not come
along and snatched her up.

1043
00:41:44.671 --> 00:41:45.917
- That was by the good old days.

1044
00:41:45.917 --> 00:41:47.232
- Yes. one of the good old days.

1045
00:41:47.232 --> 00:41:49.510
- But that's not for Cindy. mm-mh.

1046
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:52.672
Cindy is doing just
fine. aren't you sweetie?

1047
00:41:52.672 --> 00:41:53.524
- Steve's here.

1048
00:41:53.524 --> 00:41:54.357
(car honking)

1049
00:41:54.357 --> 00:41:56.942
- All right. honey. have a good time.

1050
00:41:56.942 --> 00:41:57.775
- Steve's here.

1051
00:41:57.775 --> 00:42:01.257
- Oh no. no. don't worry about it.

1052
00:42:01.257 --> 00:42:02.482
Come on.
- Steve.

1053
00:42:02.482 --> 00:42:05.835
I know I'll give you something
to fill your hands with.

1054
00:42:05.835 --> 00:42:08.590
Come on. come on. let's go. naughty boy.

1055
00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:11.774
- Play hide the beer can.
- Yeah. (laughs)

1056
00:42:23.658 --> 00:42:25.260
- Hey. cut it out.

1057
00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:26.093
- What?

1058
00:42:27.378 --> 00:42:29.802
- Come on. I'm just not ready yet.

1059
00:42:29.802 --> 00:42:31.349
- Have another beer then.

1060
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:33.099
- I'm serious.

1061
00:42:33.099 --> 00:42:34.949
Besides I have to sober up by curfew.

1062
00:42:34.949 --> 00:42:39.251
Aunt Shelly will smell my
breath and spank me again.

1063
00:42:39.251 --> 00:42:42.966
Have you thought anymore
about home coming?

1064
00:42:42.966 --> 00:42:44.996
- Yeah. I thought about it.

1065
00:42:44.996 --> 00:42:45.829
- And?

1066
00:42:48.356 --> 00:42:49.189
- I don't know.

1067
00:42:49.189 --> 00:42:51.013
I need more time. all right?

1068
00:42:51.013 --> 00:42:52.691
- But there's this other
guy who just asking me.

1069
00:42:52.691 --> 00:42:55.204
and I can't keep stalling.

1070
00:42:55.204 --> 00:42:57.695
- So go with him then.

1071
00:42:57.695 --> 00:42:58.955
- I don't want to go with him.

1072
00:42:58.955 --> 00:43:00.834
he's in my grade.

1073
00:43:00.834 --> 00:43:02.392
- Did you tell him that?

1074
00:43:02.392 --> 00:43:04.350
- No. I told him I wanna go with you.

1075
00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:05.854
but that you hadn't decided yet.

1076
00:43:05.854 --> 00:43:08.239
so he'll just have to wait.

1077
00:43:08.239 --> 00:43:09.964
- Okay. so let me get this straight.

1078
00:43:09.964 --> 00:43:13.380
You've just got this kid on hold.

1079
00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:14.213
- Kind of.

1080
00:43:16.362 --> 00:43:17.390
(Steve Chuckles)

1081
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:18.223
- What?

1082
00:43:20.529 --> 00:43:24.094
- No. nothing. nothing come here.

1083
00:43:24.094 --> 00:43:26.677
(upbeat music)

1084
00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:32.703
- [Bob] What do you mean
you haven't done her yet?

1085
00:43:32.703 --> 00:43:33.897
- She's in high school. man.

1086
00:43:33.897 --> 00:43:36.564
She's doesn't even have
a car for Christ sake.

1087
00:43:36.564 --> 00:43:38.330
- So get behind her. grab her arms.

1088
00:43:38.330 --> 00:43:39.809
and ride her like a bicycle.

1089
00:43:39.809 --> 00:43:41.398
- Yeah. I don't think
her mom would appreciate

1090
00:43:41.398 --> 00:43:42.346
that very much.

1091
00:43:42.346 --> 00:43:43.550
- Is her mom hot?

1092
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:46.552
- Probably. but she's
gotta be at least 30.

1093
00:43:46.552 --> 00:43:47.907
- You know what you should do?

1094
00:43:47.907 --> 00:43:49.764
Go to her house when her mom's there.

1095
00:43:49.764 --> 00:43:50.914
get behind her like-

1096
00:43:50.914 --> 00:43:52.398
- What's up. man?

1097
00:43:52.398 --> 00:43:54.926
- I'm just killing time before work.

1098
00:43:54.926 --> 00:43:55.998
- All right. well. I will be

1099
00:43:55.998 --> 00:43:57.878
in my room exercising my God given rights

1100
00:43:57.878 --> 00:44:00.689
to watch free porn and rub one out. so.

1101
00:44:00.689 --> 00:44:02.078
- So think of me.

1102
00:44:02.078 --> 00:44:04.470
- Always do. But you guys. okay?

1103
00:44:05.618 --> 00:44:07.561
I don't want you down
here playing games all day

1104
00:44:07.561 --> 00:44:09.210
in my parents' basement. okay.

1105
00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:11.506
Robert. take out the trash.

1106
00:44:11.506 --> 00:44:13.605
and Franklin. so help me God.

1107
00:44:13.605 --> 00:44:16.492
if I have to ask you to
mow the lawn one more time.

1108
00:44:16.492 --> 00:44:18.186
no more games. that's it.

1109
00:44:18.186 --> 00:44:20.240
- But I hate chores.

1110
00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:22.547
- That's enough out of both of you. okay?

1111
00:44:22.547 --> 00:44:24.630
- You know where I'll be.

1112
00:44:29.311 --> 00:44:30.162
- Have fun. boys.

1113
00:44:30.162 --> 00:44:30.995
(happy music)

1114
00:44:30.995 --> 00:44:31.828
- Yeah.

1115
00:44:35.533 --> 00:44:37.865
(sensual music)

1116
00:44:41.148 --> 00:44:42.316
- There you are.

1117
00:44:42.316 --> 00:44:44.158
I've been looking all over for you.

1118
00:44:44.158 --> 00:44:46.020
- I've been right here.

1119
00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:47.374
- So I see.

1120
00:44:47.374 --> 00:44:48.387
I got your message.

1121
00:44:48.387 --> 00:44:49.220
what's up?

1122
00:44:50.813 --> 00:44:54.021
- So I've decided I'm gonna go.

1123
00:44:54.021 --> 00:44:55.085
- Oh Steve.

1124
00:44:55.085 --> 00:44:56.764
- Yeah. okay. well I'm
telling you right now.

1125
00:44:56.764 --> 00:44:58.275
I'm not going to like it.

1126
00:44:58.275 --> 00:44:59.884
but ii will do it for you.

1127
00:44:59.884 --> 00:45:01.114
- This is gonna be so great.

1128
00:45:01.114 --> 00:45:03.015
My friend. Sandy. she's going
with her boyfriend. Richard.

1129
00:45:03.015 --> 00:45:04.081
if we can totally double.

1130
00:45:04.081 --> 00:45:05.705
- No. no. no. no. no. no doubles.

1131
00:45:05.705 --> 00:45:08.209
no dinners. just me and you. okay.

1132
00:45:08.209 --> 00:45:09.901
and we're not staying long.

1133
00:45:09.901 --> 00:45:12.668
- All right. but we are going?

1134
00:45:12.668 --> 00:45:15.305
- Yes Cindy. we are going to homecoming.

1135
00:45:15.305 --> 00:45:17.013
(sensual music)

1136
00:45:17.013 --> 00:45:18.179
- This is gonna be so great.

1137
00:45:18.179 --> 00:45:20.260
- Yeah.
- I gotta get back downstairs.

1138
00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:21.093
- Okay.

1139
00:45:21.093 --> 00:45:23.676
(sensual music)

1140
00:45:24.713 --> 00:45:25.546
Fuck!

1141
00:45:28.835 --> 00:45:29.668
- It's tough.

1142
00:45:29.668 --> 00:45:32.610
I mean. I know there's a
place for me at the university

1143
00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:33.443
when I graduate.

1144
00:45:33.443 --> 00:45:34.669
but the pay is not very good.

1145
00:45:34.669 --> 00:45:36.272
And then if I accept a
position somewhere else.

1146
00:45:36.272 --> 00:45:38.194
that doesn't leave any room for Nigel.

1147
00:45:38.194 --> 00:45:39.877
He's tenure. so he can't just leave.

1148
00:45:39.877 --> 00:45:41.636
- I don't know about this Nigel guy.

1149
00:45:41.636 --> 00:45:43.638
he just seems like a real douche.

1150
00:45:43.638 --> 00:45:46.077
- (chuckles) Okay.

1151
00:45:46.077 --> 00:45:47.980
He's been a real asshole lately.

1152
00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:50.552
Some guys never grow up.
- I grew up.

1153
00:45:50.552 --> 00:45:52.512
- Sure you did.
- I did.

1154
00:45:52.512 --> 00:45:54.661
- Do you think Boba Fett
could take on the Terminator?

1155
00:45:54.661 --> 00:45:55.729
- Oh my God. in a heartbeat.

1156
00:45:55.729 --> 00:45:57.521
I mean Boba Fett's a bounty hunter.

1157
00:45:57.521 --> 00:46:00.425
Terminator would have
no idea what hit him.

1158
00:46:00.425 --> 00:46:02.060
- Real mature.
- Oh. okay.

1159
00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:03.693
- We've been talking
about me all night though.

1160
00:46:03.693 --> 00:46:04.873
what about you?

1161
00:46:04.873 --> 00:46:06.109
Are you seeing anyone?

1162
00:46:06.109 --> 00:46:07.857
- More like romantically?

1163
00:46:07.857 --> 00:46:09.947
- Yeah. anyone I'd know?

1164
00:46:09.947 --> 00:46:13.518
- Oh. no. I've been kind
of more taking a break

1165
00:46:13.518 --> 00:46:15.089
from the whole dating game.

1166
00:46:15.089 --> 00:46:18.217
I'm trying to like figure some things out.

1167
00:46:18.217 --> 00:46:20.702
- That's good for you.

1168
00:46:20.702 --> 00:46:23.023
How much time have you taken?

1169
00:46:23.023 --> 00:46:25.266
- Well. like five or six-

1170
00:46:25.266 --> 00:46:26.888
- Weeks?

1171
00:46:26.888 --> 00:46:27.721
- Years.

1172
00:46:28.854 --> 00:46:30.905
- John. that's more than
a little bit of time.

1173
00:46:30.905 --> 00:46:31.886
- I know.

1174
00:46:31.886 --> 00:46:34.298
- That's since we broke up.

1175
00:46:34.298 --> 00:46:37.673
Have you not dated
anyone since we broke up?

1176
00:46:37.673 --> 00:46:39.124
- I dated a little bit.

1177
00:46:39.124 --> 00:46:42.041
like right after. but I don't know.

1178
00:46:42.916 --> 00:46:44.042
Okay. oh. okay.

1179
00:46:44.042 --> 00:46:46.206
so I like walnuts.

1180
00:46:46.206 --> 00:46:50.094
I'm not really a Chex Mix kinda guy.

1181
00:46:50.094 --> 00:46:50.956
- What?

1182
00:46:50.956 --> 00:46:53.434
- Okay. so Steve. he likes Chex Mix.

1183
00:46:53.434 --> 00:46:55.037
He likes the variety.

1184
00:46:55.037 --> 00:46:57.195
He likes to really dig in there.

1185
00:46:57.195 --> 00:47:00.534
and shove as much shit into
his face as he possibly can

1186
00:47:00.534 --> 00:47:02.956
where I like walnuts.

1187
00:47:02.956 --> 00:47:07.257
I like to really take my
time to crack into the-

1188
00:47:07.257 --> 00:47:09.135
- This is a terrible analogy.
- It's not great.

1189
00:47:09.135 --> 00:47:10.302
It's not good.

1190
00:47:11.911 --> 00:47:14.638
I guess what I'm trying
to say is you ruined me

1191
00:47:14.638 --> 00:47:15.634
for other women.

1192
00:47:15.634 --> 00:47:17.811
- Oh. because I'm a nut.

1193
00:47:17.811 --> 00:47:18.797
- Oh. that was bad.

1194
00:47:18.797 --> 00:47:19.887
that was not good.

1195
00:47:19.887 --> 00:47:21.045
- We should probably get going.

1196
00:47:21.045 --> 00:47:23.048
- Yeah. where's this waiter been?

1197
00:47:23.048 --> 00:47:24.631
I don't know where.

1198
00:47:25.812 --> 00:47:28.620
- So what time did you
even get back last night?

1199
00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:32.703
- 9:30. and I got a good night kiss.

1200
00:47:35.187 --> 00:47:36.080
Okay. it was on the cheek.

1201
00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:37.894
but it was close to the lips.

1202
00:47:37.894 --> 00:47:38.727
and I paid for dinner.

1203
00:47:38.727 --> 00:47:41.157
so that's gotta mean something. right?

1204
00:47:41.157 --> 00:47:43.743
- It means you are out 50 bucks.

1205
00:47:43.743 --> 00:47:44.576
- Okay.

1206
00:47:44.576 --> 00:47:46.038
- Look. man. if you're not gonna be down

1207
00:47:46.038 --> 00:47:47.487
below fighting for scraps.

1208
00:47:47.487 --> 00:47:48.438
like the rest of us.

1209
00:47:48.438 --> 00:47:50.913
you need to swim your ass to the surface.

1210
00:47:50.913 --> 00:47:54.080
and tickle the little man in the boat.

1211
00:47:56.490 --> 00:47:58.184
Oh. I decided I'm going to homecoming.

1212
00:47:58.184 --> 00:47:59.017
- What?

1213
00:47:59.017 --> 00:47:59.850
No shit. dude.

1214
00:47:59.850 --> 00:48:01.382
You've gotta be fucking shitting me.

1215
00:48:01.382 --> 00:48:02.715
There is no way.

1216
00:48:03.569 --> 00:48:05.215
- I figured if she's
gonna put out. you know.

1217
00:48:05.215 --> 00:48:06.822
this'll be the night

1218
00:48:06.822 --> 00:48:08.833
- God. you are gonna
humiliate yourself in front

1219
00:48:08.833 --> 00:48:11.489
of an entire high school
just to get this girl in bed.

1220
00:48:11.489 --> 00:48:12.601
are you kidding?

1221
00:48:12.601 --> 00:48:14.812
Why don't you graduate
to real women. dude?

1222
00:48:14.812 --> 00:48:16.909
- 'Cause let me tell you
something about real women.

1223
00:48:16.909 --> 00:48:17.742
- Please.

1224
00:48:17.742 --> 00:48:19.355
- They don't date guys like us. all right?

1225
00:48:19.355 --> 00:48:20.535
We're on the level.

1226
00:48:20.535 --> 00:48:22.242
Okay. we don't hide our demands.

1227
00:48:22.242 --> 00:48:25.525
and we don't try to put on a show.

1228
00:48:26.375 --> 00:48:28.511
or they don't want what
we have to offer. okay.

1229
00:48:28.511 --> 00:48:29.915
They don't want love.

1230
00:48:29.915 --> 00:48:31.183
They're not looking for sex.

1231
00:48:31.183 --> 00:48:34.140
They're looking for a
lifestyle. all right?

1232
00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:35.554
"What kind of car does he drive?

1233
00:48:35.554 --> 00:48:36.492
Is he rich?"

1234
00:48:36.492 --> 00:48:37.702
It's fucking vicious.

1235
00:48:37.702 --> 00:48:38.666
(John laughs)

1236
00:48:38.666 --> 00:48:40.455
Every hot girl that we knew in high school

1237
00:48:40.455 --> 00:48:42.432
was always dating a college guy. right?

1238
00:48:42.432 --> 00:48:43.895
- Yeah.
- They shopped up.

1239
00:48:43.895 --> 00:48:46.472
that always left guys like
me and you stuck somewhere

1240
00:48:46.472 --> 00:48:48.701
in between the fat chicks and the freaks.

1241
00:48:48.701 --> 00:48:50.143
- Fat chicks. oh...

1242
00:48:50.143 --> 00:48:52.291
- Dating isn't something that's
meant to be enjoyed. man.

1243
00:48:52.291 --> 00:48:54.132
It's an emotional trash compactor

1244
00:48:54.132 --> 00:48:56.031
that's half filled with broken wills.

1245
00:48:56.031 --> 00:48:58.525
and it's topped off with rejection.

1246
00:48:58.525 --> 00:48:59.680
- Okay.

1247
00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:02.894
- But the game can be
played both ways. right?

1248
00:49:02.894 --> 00:49:04.445
I can shop down.

1249
00:49:04.445 --> 00:49:06.544
because I am the college guy now.

1250
00:49:06.544 --> 00:49:07.811
This is my time.

1251
00:49:07.811 --> 00:49:10.411
I get to take my pick.

1252
00:49:10.411 --> 00:49:12.746
These high school girls
who wouldn't piss on me.

1253
00:49:12.746 --> 00:49:14.834
if I was on fire?

1254
00:49:14.834 --> 00:49:17.629
Now I'm exactly what they're looking for.

1255
00:49:17.629 --> 00:49:19.969
and all of those guys who used to be us.

1256
00:49:19.969 --> 00:49:21.386
those loser guys.

1257
00:49:22.348 --> 00:49:23.181
they don't know it.

1258
00:49:23.181 --> 00:49:24.895
but I'm doing it for them. all right?

1259
00:49:24.895 --> 00:49:29.257
I fuck each and every one of
those girls for those guys

1260
00:49:29.257 --> 00:49:31.100
who couldn't get a date on a Friday night.

1261
00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:32.684
- Wow!
- And it feels good.

1262
00:49:32.684 --> 00:49:33.901
- Well. I'm sure.

1263
00:49:33.901 --> 00:49:35.793
And that's so very noble of you.

1264
00:49:35.793 --> 00:49:37.228
Oh. the King coming down from the castle

1265
00:49:37.228 --> 00:49:38.784
to feed the peasants.

1266
00:49:38.784 --> 00:49:39.861
You're basically a bottom feeder.

1267
00:49:39.861 --> 00:49:41.195
and you know it.

1268
00:49:41.195 --> 00:49:42.553
- I'm a what?
- Bottom feeder. you know.

1269
00:49:42.553 --> 00:49:45.465
you're just strolling along
the bottom of the ocean

1270
00:49:45.465 --> 00:49:47.683
just picking up whatever
garbage you wanna put

1271
00:49:47.683 --> 00:49:48.516
in your mouth.

1272
00:49:48.516 --> 00:49:52.587
just way too lazy to even
just go up and get real food.

1273
00:49:52.587 --> 00:49:54.945
- Okay. yeah. so I'm
eating off the bottom.

1274
00:49:54.945 --> 00:49:57.172
I admit it.

1275
00:49:57.172 --> 00:49:59.445
This is a system that's been
in place for generations.

1276
00:49:59.445 --> 00:50:00.666
The women invented it.

1277
00:50:00.666 --> 00:50:03.570
We just need to learn how to play along.

1278
00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:06.030
Nichole's professor.
what's his fucking name?

1279
00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:06.863
- Nigel.

1280
00:50:06.863 --> 00:50:07.809
- Yeah. Nigel.
- Yeah.

1281
00:50:07.809 --> 00:50:08.980
- Bottom feeder.

1282
00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:09.813
Extra slimy.

1283
00:50:09.813 --> 00:50:10.646
- Oh yeah.

1284
00:50:10.646 --> 00:50:12.780
And you need to be twice
the fish that he is.

1285
00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:14.410
if you wanna win her back.

1286
00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:16.205
that's a lot of work. man.

1287
00:50:16.205 --> 00:50:17.788
And say you put in all that work.

1288
00:50:17.788 --> 00:50:19.775
and you don't get anything.

1289
00:50:19.775 --> 00:50:23.075
or you swim along the bottom.
- Or?

1290
00:50:23.075 --> 00:50:25.866
- You get a girl is twice as hot.

1291
00:50:25.866 --> 00:50:27.625
and a little bit younger.

1292
00:50:27.625 --> 00:50:28.458
- You know what?

1293
00:50:28.458 --> 00:50:29.291
I'm willing to bet you

1294
00:50:29.291 --> 00:50:32.341
that I will be twice as
satisfied winning back Nichole

1295
00:50:32.341 --> 00:50:34.955
than you ever would be fucking this random

1296
00:50:34.955 --> 00:50:37.176
high school sweetheart of yours.

1297
00:50:37.176 --> 00:50:38.658
- If you win her back.

1298
00:50:38.658 --> 00:50:40.825
- Oh. I'll win her back. all right?

1299
00:50:40.825 --> 00:50:42.580
I just got to get rid
of this fiance of hers.

1300
00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:44.143
and I'm fucking golden.

1301
00:50:44.143 --> 00:50:46.643
- Yeah. well. okay. we'll see.

1302
00:50:48.163 --> 00:50:50.337
All right. you're ready?
- Mm-hmm.

1303
00:50:50.337 --> 00:50:53.559
- Okay. time to beat is
two minutes 47 seconds.

1304
00:50:53.559 --> 00:50:55.405
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

1305
00:50:55.405 --> 00:50:56.886
All right. on your mark.
- Mm-hmm.

1306
00:50:56.886 --> 00:50:58.492
- Get set.
- Mm-hmm.

1307
00:50:58.492 --> 00:50:59.862
- Go.

1308
00:50:59.862 --> 00:51:03.159
(water splashes)

1309
00:51:03.159 --> 00:51:05.742
(upbeat music)

1310
00:51:11.667 --> 00:51:15.304
- Please take a look at the
outline for the midterm.

1311
00:51:15.304 --> 00:51:17.806
- Remember it represents
40% of your final grade.

1312
00:51:17.806 --> 00:51:19.825
so please. if you have any questions.

1313
00:51:19.825 --> 00:51:20.908
ask them now.

1314
00:51:27.850 --> 00:51:29.293
(John whistles)

1315
00:51:29.293 --> 00:51:30.126
- Goddamn!

1316
00:51:31.226 --> 00:51:33.136
- Come on. it won't be that bad

1317
00:51:33.136 --> 00:51:34.599
look at these questions.

1318
00:51:34.599 --> 00:51:35.966
- I don't know. Nichole.

1319
00:51:35.966 --> 00:51:39.100
I'm not good at taking tests.

1320
00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:42.071
- Maybe I can help you study.

1321
00:51:42.071 --> 00:51:43.654
- I like that idea.

1322
00:51:45.523 --> 00:51:48.523
(upbeat rock music)

1323
00:51:56.307 --> 00:51:57.882
- Hello. Nichole.

1324
00:51:57.882 --> 00:51:59.664
- Oh. you just missed John.

1325
00:51:59.664 --> 00:52:00.497
He went to class.

1326
00:52:00.497 --> 00:52:02.083
- Yeah. no. I know.

1327
00:52:02.083 --> 00:52:06.181
I was kinda hoping I could
talk to you actually.

1328
00:52:06.181 --> 00:52:09.258
Look. John is. he's a good guy.

1329
00:52:09.258 --> 00:52:10.521
You know that.

1330
00:52:10.521 --> 00:52:15.520
but we both know that he's sensitive.

1331
00:52:16.738 --> 00:52:18.350
- Yeah. I know.

1332
00:52:18.350 --> 00:52:21.523
- So like the last time
that you two were together.

1333
00:52:21.523 --> 00:52:23.690
and then you broke it off.

1334
00:52:25.495 --> 00:52:27.737
things got kinda bad.

1335
00:52:27.737 --> 00:52:29.696
like really bad.

1336
00:52:29.696 --> 00:52:30.529
- Oh. come on.

1337
00:52:30.529 --> 00:52:31.372
- No. I'm talking.

1338
00:52:31.372 --> 00:52:33.302
he was catatonic. okay.

1339
00:52:33.302 --> 00:52:36.197
It took a lot of serious
vitamins to turn that boy around.

1340
00:52:36.197 --> 00:52:37.030
- What's your point?

1341
00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:41.735
- My point is I know you.
you're evil. all right?

1342
00:52:41.735 --> 00:52:44.741
I know exactly what's
gonna happen this time.

1343
00:52:44.741 --> 00:52:47.530
All I'm asking is that you
give me some sort of heads up

1344
00:52:47.530 --> 00:52:49.137
before you fuck him over again. okay?

1345
00:52:49.137 --> 00:52:50.612
- Fuck you. Steve.

1346
00:52:50.612 --> 00:52:52.743
- If you wanna fuck me. that's fine.

1347
00:52:52.743 --> 00:52:55.888
Just like give me a heads
up before you do it. okay?

1348
00:52:55.888 --> 00:52:57.404
Thank you.

1349
00:53:02.239 --> 00:53:04.989
- All right. for society to grow.

1350
00:53:05.885 --> 00:53:10.885
there have to be rules that
everyone is in agreements with.

1351
00:53:11.071 --> 00:53:15.630
Now these are the laws
that keep society going-

1352
00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:16.463
(door shuts)

1353
00:53:20.982 --> 00:53:24.899
but also there's the
common sense things. like-

1354
00:53:27.518 --> 00:53:29.760
right now. it's also
the common sense things

1355
00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:31.889
people forget. like they'll
give someone a stick

1356
00:53:31.889 --> 00:53:33.255
to whoop you in the head with.

1357
00:53:33.255 --> 00:53:34.413
- Where the fuck were you?

1358
00:53:34.413 --> 00:53:37.511
- Dude them falling behind
with all the homecoming crap.

1359
00:53:37.511 --> 00:53:41.374
I gotta get a suit.
tickets. condoms. whatever.

1360
00:53:41.374 --> 00:53:43.313
I gotta get my paycheck after this class.

1361
00:53:43.313 --> 00:53:45.102
- At least. you know. you're
actually gonna get laid.

1362
00:53:45.102 --> 00:53:47.396
Nichole's coming over later to study

1363
00:53:47.396 --> 00:53:48.782
whatever the fuck that means.

1364
00:53:48.782 --> 00:53:50.820
- It means you're gonna be a
wreck for the rest of the day.

1365
00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:53.670
- Boys. y'all hear me?

1366
00:53:55.396 --> 00:53:56.729
- Seven.
- Seven.

1367
00:53:57.689 --> 00:54:01.451
- Good. I thought you
wasn't paying attention.

1368
00:54:01.451 --> 00:54:05.271
So that comes all the way down
then to why people go there.

1369
00:54:05.271 --> 00:54:07.012
and why they end up having to wear them

1370
00:54:07.012 --> 00:54:08.845
before they go inside.

1371
00:54:11.287 --> 00:54:14.204
(video game music)

1372
00:54:16.121 --> 00:54:17.910
- No. no. no. boys come on. out.

1373
00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:20.377
So I got Nichole coming
over at three to study.

1374
00:54:20.377 --> 00:54:21.729
- Hold on. we just need 15 minutes.

1375
00:54:21.729 --> 00:54:22.562
- Out!

1376
00:54:22.562 --> 00:54:24.147
- We're about to flip the score.

1377
00:54:24.147 --> 00:54:25.296
- Now!

1378
00:54:25.296 --> 00:54:28.128
- But John-
- Look. do it tomorrow. Frank.

1379
00:54:28.128 --> 00:54:29.320
Come on. out boys.

1380
00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:30.347
Come on. let's move.

1381
00:54:30.347 --> 00:54:31.559
Let's move. quickly. let's go.

1382
00:54:31.559 --> 00:54:33.476
- We're going.
- You guys move so slow.

1383
00:54:33.476 --> 00:54:34.897
Let's go. come on.

1384
00:54:34.897 --> 00:54:36.064
- All right. look at that. see here we go.

1385
00:54:36.064 --> 00:54:38.341
I'm moving along.
- Move. let's hustle.

1386
00:54:38.341 --> 00:54:40.977
Let's get out of my house.

1387
00:54:40.977 --> 00:54:42.913
- It's our house too.
- It's not.

1388
00:54:42.913 --> 00:54:44.504

- Yeah.

1409
00:56:00.588 --> 00:56:03.171
(upbeat music)

1410
00:56:12.050 --> 00:56:12.883
- So...

1411
00:56:14.568 --> 00:56:16.215
how's Nigel?

1412
00:56:16.215 --> 00:56:17.772
- He's being a prick.

1413
00:56:17.772 --> 00:56:19.958
We got in this huge fight.

1414
00:56:19.958 --> 00:56:21.639
All he ever does this lie to me.

1415
00:56:21.639 --> 00:56:23.222
- That's not right.

1416
00:56:24.294 --> 00:56:26.240
- John. you know you
don't have to get me drunk

1417
00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:27.657
to sleep with me.

1418
00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:31.710
- Ah. but I bought all this beer.

1419
00:56:36.494 --> 00:56:37.653
- How long do you give him?

1420
00:56:37.653 --> 00:56:39.322
- 10 minutes.

1421
00:56:39.322 --> 00:56:40.980
- Ouch. that's cold.

1422
00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:42.292
No faith in him?

1423
00:56:42.292 --> 00:56:44.281
He's a magnificent stallion.

1424
00:56:44.281 --> 00:56:46.047
- How long has it been?

1425
00:56:46.047 --> 00:56:46.880
Six years?

1426
00:56:47.717 --> 00:56:52.704
10 minutes at the top end unless
they're actually studying.

1427
00:56:52.704 --> 00:56:55.454
(both chuckling)

1428
00:56:59.035 --> 00:57:02.028
- Wait Nichole. does this
mean we're back together?

1429
00:57:02.028 --> 00:57:04.196
- Why does this have to mean anything?

1430
00:57:04.196 --> 00:57:07.118
Can't we just fuck for old time's sake.

1431
00:57:07.118 --> 00:57:11.519
- No. I don't want just
some throwaway fuck.

1432
00:57:11.519 --> 00:57:12.691
I want you.

1433
00:57:12.691 --> 00:57:15.699
- Oh God. we can't just
get back together. John.

1434
00:57:15.699 --> 00:57:17.631
It's been six years.

1435
00:57:17.631 --> 00:57:19.717
We're different people.

1436
00:57:19.717 --> 00:57:23.217
I'm just really pissed at Nigel right now.

1437
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:26.590
It's revenge sex.

1438
00:57:26.590 --> 00:57:28.161
Can you handle that?

1439
00:57:28.161 --> 00:57:31.605
- No. I don't think I can.
I have feelings here.

1440
00:57:31.605 --> 00:57:34.230
- Oh God. it's not about feelings.

1441
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:36.978
and it's not about a relationship.

1442
00:57:36.978 --> 00:57:39.311
We had some good times sure.

1443
00:57:40.166 --> 00:57:42.217
but I've changed.

1444
00:57:42.217 --> 00:57:43.744
Maybe you haven't.

1445
00:57:43.744 --> 00:57:45.192
- I...I have.

1446
00:57:45.192 --> 00:57:47.297
- That's it. isn't it?

1447
00:57:47.297 --> 00:57:49.854
God. six years later and
still the same old John.

1448
00:57:49.854 --> 00:57:50.961
- No.

1449
00:57:50.961 --> 00:57:52.473
- You know. I bet you're
still duct taping yourself

1450
00:57:52.473 --> 00:57:54.400
to lawn chairs and jumping in the lake.

1451
00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:56.896
- Okay. my best time's
almost a world record.

1452
00:57:56.896 --> 00:57:59.370
- You know. I almost love you. John.

1453
00:57:59.370 --> 00:58:01.396
but if you could just
act like more of a man.

1454
00:58:01.396 --> 00:58:02.229
- I am.

1455
00:58:02.229 --> 00:58:03.158
- Hell. you hang out with your friends.

1456
00:58:03.158 --> 00:58:04.709
and live in your parents' basement.

1457
00:58:04.709 --> 00:58:08.361
Hell. you're still going to
a two year community college.

1458
00:58:08.361 --> 00:58:09.865
You don't take your life seriously.

1459
00:58:09.865 --> 00:58:10.698
but you expect me

1460
00:58:10.698 --> 00:58:13.558
to think you can take a
relationship seriously?

1461
00:58:13.558 --> 00:58:14.839
- Look. I've changed. okay?

1462
00:58:14.839 --> 00:58:16.060
You may not be able to see it
- Bullshit!

1463
00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:18.146
- but I have.
- Okay. take the chem class.

1464
00:58:18.146 --> 00:58:21.302
It is so obvious that you're
just there to be around me.

1465
00:58:21.302 --> 00:58:22.724
That is a real class.

1466
00:58:22.724 --> 00:58:25.252
and you haven't listened to
a word the professor said.

1467
00:58:25.252 --> 00:58:26.476
You don't care what you get on the exam.

1468
00:58:26.476 --> 00:58:29.691
You just invited me here to sleep with me.

1469
00:58:29.691 --> 00:58:33.215
and I came here because I wanted to too.

1470
00:58:33.215 --> 00:58:35.964
but now you're talking
about a relationship.

1471
00:58:35.964 --> 00:58:38.454
You don't know the responsibility it takes

1472
00:58:38.454 --> 00:58:40.835
to make a relationship work.

1473
00:58:40.835 --> 00:58:43.709
- Oh I...I...I...I might-

1474
00:58:43.709 --> 00:58:45.118
- You know what?

1475
00:58:45.118 --> 00:58:47.085
I'll tell you what.

1476
00:58:47.085 --> 00:58:49.462
you wanna prove to me that
you know what it takes

1477
00:58:49.462 --> 00:58:53.629
to build a real relationship.
you ace that midterm.

1478
00:58:54.668 --> 00:58:55.501
- What?

1479
00:58:55.501 --> 00:58:57.180
- You get an A on that test.

1480
00:58:57.180 --> 00:59:00.313
and it'll show me that
you know what it takes.

1481
00:59:00.313 --> 00:59:01.655
You don't get an A.

1482
00:59:01.655 --> 00:59:02.488
it's all over.

1483
00:59:02.488 --> 00:59:04.388
- Look. Nichole. that's
fucking ridiculous.

1484
00:59:04.388 --> 00:59:05.465
- No buts.

1485
00:59:05.465 --> 00:59:06.757
I know it's crazy.

1486
00:59:06.757 --> 00:59:10.272
but I'm gonna give you your shot.

1487
00:59:10.272 --> 00:59:11.522
I owe you that.

1488
00:59:13.424 --> 00:59:15.354
You've got a week and a half

1489
00:59:15.354 --> 00:59:18.820
better take the plastic
off those text books.

1490
00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:23.550
- But they're (stammers).

1491
00:59:23.550 --> 00:59:25.010
- Oh. my God.

1492
00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:27.427
(door opens)

1493
00:59:29.165 --> 00:59:30.332
- Bye. Nichole.

1494
00:59:30.332 --> 00:59:31.460
- Bye Nichole.

1495
00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:34.043
(upbeat music)

1496
00:59:37.719 --> 00:59:39.049
- Dibs on controller one.

1497
00:59:39.049 --> 00:59:41.632
(upbeat music)

1498
01:00:12.088 --> 01:00:13.338
Oh yeah. shit!

1499
01:00:34.816 --> 01:00:36.514
- (laughs) Cool Ranch!

1500
01:00:36.514 --> 01:00:38.769
- Right. I figured you do
deserve to see me in something

1501
01:00:38.769 --> 01:00:40.393
that isn't a t-shirt.

1502
01:00:40.393 --> 01:00:41.672
- Hell. I've seen you naked.

1503
01:00:41.672 --> 01:00:45.616
- Hey. I thought we agreed
to never talk about that.

1504
01:00:45.616 --> 01:00:47.202
- What's going on with the tie.

1505
01:00:47.202 --> 01:00:48.384
- Might wanna work on as a clip on.

1506
01:00:48.384 --> 01:00:50.215
so I don't know how to do it.

1507
01:00:50.215 --> 01:00:52.632
- Oh my God. come here. dude.

1508
01:00:57.673 --> 01:00:58.953
- What's this?

1509
01:00:58.953 --> 01:01:01.660
- If I don't pass my chemistry midterm.

1510
01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:03.663
I lose Nichole forever.

1511
01:01:03.663 --> 01:01:04.818
- So?

1512
01:01:04.818 --> 01:01:06.318
- So I'm studying.

1513
01:01:07.375 --> 01:01:09.083
- Aren't you on the air in an hour.

1514
01:01:09.083 --> 01:01:10.866
- Yeah. but I'm just
gonna look at my notes

1515
01:01:10.866 --> 01:01:11.848
in between the songs

1516
01:01:11.848 --> 01:01:14.718
and then it's back to the wall.

1517
01:01:14.718 --> 01:01:16.718
no sleep for me tonight.

1518
01:01:18.142 --> 01:01:18.975
By the looks of it.

1519
01:01:18.975 --> 01:01:20.511
and you won't be getting very much either.

1520
01:01:20.511 --> 01:01:21.611
- Shit. I better not.

1521
01:01:21.611 --> 01:01:24.002
This stuff was expensive.

1522
01:01:24.002 --> 01:01:25.270
- All right. well. I thought I had.

1523
01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:26.804
- I'll Google it.

1524
01:01:26.804 --> 01:01:28.650
- You got condoms though. right?

1525
01:01:28.650 --> 01:01:31.040
- Buddy. I am a Trojan shareholder.

1526
01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.014
- Atta boy!

1527
01:01:32.014 --> 01:01:34.651
Well. remember if you get
caught behind enemy lines

1528
01:01:34.651 --> 01:01:37.581
we will disavow any
knowledge of your existence.

1529
01:01:37.581 --> 01:01:40.031
- For queen and country. sir.

1530
01:01:40.031 --> 01:01:41.063
- Godspeed.

1531
01:01:41.063 --> 01:01:43.980
(orchestral music)

1532
01:01:47.428 --> 01:01:49.033
- Oh and John?

1533
01:01:49.033 --> 01:01:54.033
You do realize those pages
are double-sided. correct?

1534
01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:55.043
Good luck.

1535
01:01:55.043 --> 01:01:55.876

- Uh-huh.

1545
01:02:31.153 --> 01:02:34.236
- What do you do you do for a living?

1546
01:02:36.712 --> 01:02:38.129
- I make bullets.

1547
01:02:39.634 --> 01:02:40.659
- Cool.

1548
01:02:40.659 --> 01:02:42.989
You like sell them to Mega Mart or?

1549
01:02:42.989 --> 01:02:45.351
(Shelly laughs)

1550
01:02:45.351 --> 01:02:47.143
- Zeke. Zeke. don't scare the boy.

1551
01:02:47.143 --> 01:02:48.857
don't scare the boy.

1552
01:02:48.857 --> 01:02:51.491
Honey. Zeke here is a big Teddy bear.

1553
01:02:51.491 --> 01:02:52.590
and you don't have to be scared.

1554
01:02:52.590 --> 01:02:53.714
aint that right. Zeke?

1555
01:02:53.714 --> 01:02:56.214
(Zeke growls)

1556
01:02:57.569 --> 01:02:59.692
- Well. that must be Cindy
now coming down the stairs?

1557
01:02:59.692 --> 01:03:00.859
- Please God.

1558
01:03:03.550 --> 01:03:05.468
- Oh my God. look at my baby.

1559
01:03:05.468 --> 01:03:06.301
- [Zeke] Whoo!

1560
01:03:06.301 --> 01:03:07.661
- My beautiful girl.

1561
01:03:07.661 --> 01:03:08.805
Looks good enough to eat.

1562
01:03:08.805 --> 01:03:10.721
She gets that from her Aunt.

1563
01:03:10.721 --> 01:03:13.572
- Come here. girl. let me look at you.

1564
01:03:13.572 --> 01:03:15.250
Come on. spin around.

1565
01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:16.802
Goddamn!

1566
01:03:16.802 --> 01:03:17.635
Woo!

1567
01:03:17.635 --> 01:03:19.816
Now you got my card in case you need

1568
01:03:19.816 --> 01:03:20.835
to get in touch with me.

1569
01:03:20.835 --> 01:03:23.252
- Yeah. yes. sir. right here.

1570
01:03:25.772 --> 01:03:27.748
(foot stomps)

1571
01:03:27.748 --> 01:03:28.831
- Uncle Zeke.

1572
01:03:31.802 --> 01:03:32.635
- Come on.

1573
01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:36.025
- All right. be good have fun.

1574
01:03:36.025 --> 01:03:36.858
- Okay.

1575
01:03:40.017 --> 01:03:41.829
- You take care of our
Cindy here. you hear?

1576
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:43.101
- Oh yes. yes. sir.

1577
01:03:43.101 --> 01:03:44.455
- Not too good.

1578
01:03:44.455 --> 01:03:46.350
You gotta leave me some.

1579
01:03:46.350 --> 01:03:47.933
- Okay.
- All right.

1580
01:03:48.781 --> 01:03:49.614
- All right.

1581
01:03:49.614 --> 01:03:51.281
- I'll walk you out.

1582
01:03:54.112 --> 01:03:55.385
- All this butt grabbing
got me feeling kind

1583
01:03:55.385 --> 01:03:56.802
of a certain way.

1584
01:03:57.870 --> 01:04:01.120
Damn. them girls look like their grandma.

1585
01:04:03.929 --> 01:04:05.080
- Bye. bye. love birds.

1586
01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:07.671
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

1587
01:04:07.671 --> 01:04:10.553
- Jesus. I thought we'd
never get out of there.

1588
01:04:10.553 --> 01:04:12.775
- Yeah. sorry about that.

1589
01:04:12.775 --> 01:04:16.024
He wasn't supposed to be here today.

1590
01:04:16.024 --> 01:04:18.157
- You really think they believed
that I'm in high school?

1591
01:04:18.157 --> 01:04:19.303
I mean.

1592
01:04:19.303 --> 01:04:21.490
- I told them you were a junior.

1593
01:04:21.490 --> 01:04:23.506
- Really?
- Yeah.

1594
01:04:23.506 --> 01:04:25.007
Besides I told him you have a curfew.

1595
01:04:25.007 --> 01:04:27.943
and I'll be staying with some
friends after homecoming.

1596
01:04:27.943 --> 01:04:29.193
- What friends?

1597
01:04:32.595 --> 01:04:34.595
- The ones at the hotel.

1598
01:04:54.591 --> 01:04:57.486
- You do look really great by the way.

1599
01:04:57.486 --> 01:04:58.319
- I know.

1600
01:04:59.259 --> 01:05:02.092
(car engine revs)

1601
01:05:07.866 --> 01:05:10.449
(upbeat music)

1602
01:05:12.147 --> 01:05:14.152
- Hey man. I really
think we should upgrade

1603
01:05:14.152 --> 01:05:17.150
our video game system to
something that's not 50 years old.

1604
01:05:17.150 --> 01:05:18.935
- I mean. we'll upgrade
our video game system

1605
01:05:18.935 --> 01:05:21.789
when John upgrades his video game system.

1606
01:05:21.789 --> 01:05:22.655
- That's fair.

1607
01:05:22.655 --> 01:05:23.572
Yeah. yeah.

1608
01:05:24.507 --> 01:05:26.268
- I'm just gonna rack up these Ws.

1609
01:05:26.268 --> 01:05:27.728
'cause you haven't won in like ages.

1610
01:05:27.728 --> 01:05:28.881
like I'm really.

1611
01:05:28.881 --> 01:05:30.741
I'd rather play the
computer at this point.

1612
01:05:30.741 --> 01:05:31.860
- This is why I hate playing

1613
01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:33.294
when you're wearing the victory shawl.

1614
01:05:33.294 --> 01:05:35.511
Let me just. I mean. you only Victors get

1615
01:05:35.511 --> 01:05:38.261
to wear the victory shawl loser.

1616
01:05:39.324 --> 01:05:40.318
- You're a loser.

1617
01:05:40.318 --> 01:05:41.641
- Your mom's a loser.

1618
01:05:41.641 --> 01:05:43.241
(upbeat music)

1619
01:05:43.241 --> 01:05:44.491
- Okay. thanks.

1620
01:05:46.807 --> 01:05:51.807
- Señor Dillard?
Esteban? Estás tú?

1621
01:05:54.044 --> 01:05:56.629
Don't you think you're a little old

1622
01:05:56.629 --> 01:05:59.495
to be attending homecoming.

1623
01:05:59.495 --> 01:06:02.016
like maybe it's kinda
inappropriate for you

1624
01:06:02.016 --> 01:06:03.349
to even be here.

1625
01:06:05.452 --> 01:06:08.669
- Well. it's no more inappropriate
than the flask you keep

1626
01:06:08.669 --> 01:06:09.752
in your desk.

1627
01:06:10.688 --> 01:06:12.860
- Go have a good time. okay?

1628
01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:14.054
Yeah. (laughs)

1629
01:06:14.054 --> 01:06:14.887
Gracias.

1630
01:06:16.504 --> 01:06:18.333
- Yep. this is homecoming.

1631
01:06:18.333 --> 01:06:20.083
- I'll be right back.

1632
01:06:21.335 --> 01:06:23.918
(upbeat music)

1633
01:06:26.885 --> 01:06:27.789
- You know her?

1634
01:06:27.789 --> 01:06:29.066
- Yeah Cindy Pressman.

1635
01:06:29.066 --> 01:06:30.126
She's in my class.

1636
01:06:30.126 --> 01:06:31.075
- Yeah.

1637
01:06:31.075 --> 01:06:32.576
You want her don't you?

1638
01:06:32.576 --> 01:06:34.119
- Oh yeah. she's all right.

1639
01:06:34.119 --> 01:06:36.192
Yeah. well. it is never gonna happen.

1640
01:06:36.192 --> 01:06:39.848
so come on. don't worry. man.

1641
01:06:39.848 --> 01:06:40.874
You know what?

1642
01:06:40.874 --> 01:06:43.483
You keep your eye on those
junior high girls. alright?

1643
01:06:43.483 --> 01:06:46.066

Oh shit. 101.2. the bartender.

1652

That was Adam Infantino

1653
01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:17.900
Sorry about all that dead
air I was well. whatever.

1654
01:07:17.932 --> 01:07:20.765
Up next to we got some Pus
Buckets. some Shelly Wilkes.

01:07:31.215 --> 01:07:34.373
gets two tickets to
Patrick Jaouen on the 17th.

1661
01:07:34.373 --> 01:07:36.948
so 101.2.

1662
01:07:38.514 --> 01:07:43.514
- [Man] 101.2. Rochester's.
original (beep) station.

1663
01:07:43.724 --> 01:07:44.557
- God!

1664
01:07:46.096 --> 01:07:48.679
(mellow music)

1665
01:07:53.026 --> 01:07:54.976
- Well. I'm gonna go freshen up.

1666
01:07:54.976 --> 01:07:58.143
(mellow upbeat music)

1667
01:08:01.380 --> 01:08:04.130
- Well bed. it's just me and you.

1668
01:08:05.983 --> 01:08:07.971
You don't let me down.

1669
01:08:07.971 --> 01:08:11.155
maybe I'll wipe you off after.

1670
01:08:11.155 --> 01:08:12.383
Deal?

1671
01:08:12.383 --> 01:08:14.966
(mellow music)

1672
01:08:32.623 --> 01:08:35.285
- So what do you think?

1673
01:08:35.285 --> 01:08:37.302
- Lamb of God.

1674
01:08:45.108 --> 01:08:46.012
- Be gentle.

1675
01:08:46.012 --> 01:08:49.429
(mellow music continues)

1676
01:09:00.326 --> 01:09:02.909
(upbeat music)

1677
01:10:05.072 --> 01:10:07.074
- How was your test asshole?

1678
01:10:07.074 --> 01:10:08.506
- Don't ask.

1679
01:10:08.506 --> 01:10:10.006
How was the dance?

1680
01:10:12.186 --> 01:10:13.709
- Not so great.

1681
01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:14.690
- Don't tell me it didn't happen.

1682
01:10:14.690 --> 01:10:16.265
- No. it happened.

1683
01:10:16.265 --> 01:10:17.515
It's just that...

1684
01:10:20.139 --> 01:10:21.972
- It's just that what?

1685
01:10:23.216 --> 01:10:24.784
- All right. well. I
didn't wanna fuck around

1686
01:10:24.784 --> 01:10:25.853
and cum too fast.

1687
01:10:25.853 --> 01:10:30.473
so I snuck off and jerked off
in the bathroom three times

1688
01:10:30.473 --> 01:10:31.306
during the dance.

1689
01:10:31.306 --> 01:10:32.252
- (laughs) You did not.

1690
01:10:32.252 --> 01:10:33.839
- Yeah. yeah. I did.

1691
01:10:33.839 --> 01:10:36.698
- And then when it came
time to assemble the troops.

1692
01:10:36.698 --> 01:10:38.487
we were out of ammo.

1693
01:10:38.487 --> 01:10:39.779
- So what did you do?

1694
01:10:39.779 --> 01:10:41.028
- I did what any good soldier would do.

1695
01:10:41.028 --> 01:10:42.578
I faked it.

1696
01:10:42.578 --> 01:10:43.738
- You faked it.

1697
01:10:43.738 --> 01:10:45.730
- Eight times.
- Only eight?

1698
01:10:45.730 --> 01:10:47.410
- I ran out of condoms.

1699
01:10:47.410 --> 01:10:49.835
- So what. dude. you were faking it.

1700
01:10:49.835 --> 01:10:52.805
- Yeah. but I didn't
wanna spoil the illusion.

1701
01:10:52.805 --> 01:10:55.882
- Well dude. Bravo. Mr. Copperfield.

1702
01:10:55.882 --> 01:10:56.754
- It's inhuman. man.

1703
01:10:56.754 --> 01:10:59.638
I can't live up to this chick's standards.

1704
01:10:59.638 --> 01:11:01.629
I mean. if I have to repeat
a performance like that.

1705
01:11:01.629 --> 01:11:05.629
I'm gonna blow my colon out or worse.

1706
01:11:07.048 --> 01:11:08.610
- So you're coming to class today or what?

1707
01:11:08.610 --> 01:11:12.158
- Hell no. those chairs would kill me.

1708
01:11:12.158 --> 01:11:12.991
No.

1709
01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:18.999
When do you figure out about your test?

1710
01:11:18.999 --> 01:11:20.816
- Next week.

1711
01:11:20.816 --> 01:11:22.335
- I don't know if I made it though. man.

1712
01:11:22.335 --> 01:11:24.606
- No. I'm sure you did.

1713
01:11:24.606 --> 01:11:27.383
You and that science shit
are like this. you know?

1714
01:11:27.383 --> 01:11:29.414
- I guess. yeah.

1715
01:11:29.414 --> 01:11:31.612
- Oh. oh. are you okay?

1716
01:11:31.612 --> 01:11:33.279
Come on.
- Oh my God.

1717
01:11:35.044 --> 01:11:36.687
- [Steve Is it possible for your own sperm

1718
01:11:36.687 --> 01:11:38.200
to kick you in the nuts?

1719
01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:41.160
I didn't think that was.

1720
01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:43.013
- Dude. no friendly fire.

1721
01:11:43.013 --> 01:11:44.232
- Well. maybe don't get in my way.

1722
01:11:44.232 --> 01:11:45.065
- You shot me.

1723
01:11:45.065 --> 01:11:46.234
You fucking shot me.

1724
01:11:46.234 --> 01:11:47.327
- Yeah. I'm about to do it again.

1725
01:11:47.327 --> 01:11:49.324
- You miss more shots than
a fucking Stormtrooper.

1726
01:11:49.324 --> 01:11:50.776
and you fucking shot me?

1727
01:11:50.776 --> 01:11:53.559
- Yeah. yeah. I did.
- Bullshit!

1728
01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:54.418
- You're bullshit.

1729
01:11:54.418 --> 01:11:55.809
- Get wrecked.

1730
01:11:55.809 --> 01:11:56.642
- Fine.

1731
01:11:56.642 --> 01:11:57.697
(Bob laughs)

1732
01:11:57.697 --> 01:11:59.457
- I love you. man.
- I love you too.

1733
01:11:59.457 --> 01:12:02.124
(both laughing)

1734
01:12:04.438 --> 01:12:05.848
- Hold on. hold on.

1735
01:12:05.848 --> 01:12:07.214
What if somebody comes?

1736
01:12:07.214 --> 01:12:08.547
- Somebody will.

1737
01:12:17.388 --> 01:12:19.055
- It's for the best.

1738
01:12:23.595 --> 01:12:25.371
- What do you want?

1739
01:12:25.371 --> 01:12:26.954
- I'm just leaving.

1740
01:12:30.774 --> 01:12:33.268
- I can't accept your exam sheet.

1741
01:12:33.268 --> 01:12:34.101
- But why?

1742
01:12:35.488 --> 01:12:37.016
- Because you were still
filling in the bubbles

1743
01:12:37.016 --> 01:12:39.137
after I told everybody to
put their pencils down.

1744
01:12:39.137 --> 01:12:40.648
I can't accept it.

1745
01:12:40.648 --> 01:12:42.189
- I busted my ass to finish.

1746
01:12:42.189 --> 01:12:43.622
All I was doing was filling out my name

1747
01:12:43.622 --> 01:12:44.601
on the other side of the sheet.

1748
01:12:44.601 --> 01:12:46.039
- Yeah. well. there are rules.

1749
01:12:46.039 --> 01:12:46.872
I'm sorry.

1750
01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:50.668
- Do you know who I am?

1751
01:12:50.668 --> 01:12:52.137
- No.

1752
01:12:52.137 --> 01:12:52.970
- Good.

1753
01:12:55.788 --> 01:12:58.448
- (laughs) Brilliant.

1754
01:12:58.448 --> 01:13:01.959
- Mr. Barden. I finished
correcting your exam.

1755
01:13:01.959 --> 01:13:02.821
- You have?

1756
01:13:02.821 --> 01:13:04.702
- Yes. and I have to be honest.

1757
01:13:04.702 --> 01:13:06.673
I find it pretty surprising.

1758
01:13:06.673 --> 01:13:10.128
Well. I do you know some things
about the periodic table.

1759
01:13:10.128 --> 01:13:12.784
- Apparently not. I mean.
statistically speaking

1760
01:13:12.784 --> 01:13:15.011
you should have had at least
one of those answers correct.

1761
01:13:15.011 --> 01:13:19.761
I mean. you really dinged the
hell out of the bell curve.

1762
01:13:24.119 --> 01:13:25.689
You know Mr. Barden.

1763
01:13:25.689 --> 01:13:27.574
I noticed recently you've
been kind of distracted.

1764
01:13:27.574 --> 01:13:31.666
I mean. are you going
through something personal?

1765
01:13:31.666 --> 01:13:33.573
- Yeah. kind of.

1766
01:13:33.573 --> 01:13:36.450
I mean. I can make arrangements for you

1767
01:13:36.450 --> 01:13:37.802
to take the exam again.

1768
01:13:37.802 --> 01:13:40.430
- If I'm being honest I really don't think

1769
01:13:40.430 --> 01:13:42.416
it's gonna make too big of a difference.

1770
01:13:42.416 --> 01:13:44.293
but thank you.

1771
01:13:44.293 --> 01:13:45.609
- Look here. I'm gonna be honest with you.

1772
01:13:45.609 --> 01:13:46.526
I like you.

1773
01:13:47.582 --> 01:13:49.177
and frankly a lot.

1774
01:13:49.177 --> 01:13:53.260
I mean. would you like to
get an A in this class?

1775
01:13:54.404 --> 01:13:55.571
- An A?
- Yeah.

1776
01:13:58.003 --> 01:14:00.586
- What do I have to do for a C?

1777
01:14:02.865 --> 01:14:07.690
- Society will not allow a "Sissy" to-

1778
01:14:10.101 --> 01:14:12.197
You're late again. son.

1779
01:14:12.197 --> 01:14:14.179
Is that Professor
Ding-a-ling-a-fing-a-dinger

1780
01:14:14.179 --> 01:14:15.679
keeping you after?

1781
01:14:17.089 --> 01:14:18.936
- Something like that.

1782
01:14:18.936 --> 01:14:20.033
- Where were you?

1783
01:14:20.033 --> 01:14:21.227
- I got my test back.

1784
01:14:21.227 --> 01:14:22.904
- Oh. nice. how'd you do?

1785
01:14:22.904 --> 01:14:24.295
- I got an A.

1786
01:14:24.295 --> 01:14:26.390
- Cool. man. I told you
you got that chemistry down

1787
01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:27.593
to a science.

1788
01:14:27.593 --> 01:14:29.960
- Yeah. do you have any gum?

1789
01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:32.116
- Over the years it became-
you have to make a sissy

1790
01:14:32.116 --> 01:14:33.713
which was a number-

1791
01:14:33.713 --> 01:14:35.796
- We have an ugly school.

1792
01:14:37.511 --> 01:14:39.281
(Cindy sniffles)

1793
01:14:39.281 --> 01:14:40.989
- Shit. Shit. shit!
- What. what?

1794
01:14:40.989 --> 01:14:42.406
- Come on.
- What?

1795
01:14:43.248 --> 01:14:44.699
Oh my God.

1796
01:14:44.699 --> 01:14:46.606
- Dude?
- What?

1797
01:14:46.606 --> 01:14:47.439
- That's Cindy.

1798
01:14:47.439 --> 01:14:49.360
- Oh!
- She's waiting for me.

1799
01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:51.229
- Are we gonna launch
another offensive admiral.

1800
01:14:51.229 --> 01:14:53.323
- Dude. she can't get enough.

1801
01:14:53.323 --> 01:14:54.315
- Poor baby.

1802
01:14:54.315 --> 01:14:55.657
- No. I'm serious. man.

1803
01:14:55.657 --> 01:14:57.051
- All right. my pubes are going gray.

1804
01:14:57.051 --> 01:14:57.912
my back hurts.

1805
01:14:57.912 --> 01:15:00.603
I'm thirsty like all the time.

1806
01:15:00.603 --> 01:15:02.659
She's sucking the life out of me.

1807
01:15:02.659 --> 01:15:03.627
- Literally?
- Yeah.

1808
01:15:03.627 --> 01:15:04.460
(John laughs)

1809
01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:06.701
- Look. if I'm not at your
house in like two hours

1810
01:15:06.701 --> 01:15:08.626
you gotta text me. okay?

1811
01:15:08.626 --> 01:15:10.579
- Sure.
- No. I'm serious. man.

1812
01:15:10.579 --> 01:15:11.412
All right?

1813
01:15:11.412 --> 01:15:12.245
You don't text me.

1814
01:15:12.245 --> 01:15:13.078
I might not make it.

1815
01:15:13.078 --> 01:15:14.130
I'm gonna need an excuse.

1816
01:15:14.130 --> 01:15:15.854
- Well. I mean. if you're gonna go out.

1817
01:15:15.854 --> 01:15:18.390
it's really not that
bad of a way to do it.

1818
01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:19.223
- I don't know.

1819
01:15:19.223 --> 01:15:20.199
I feel like an old fashioned heart attack

1820
01:15:20.199 --> 01:15:22.368
might be a little bit easier.

1821
01:15:22.368 --> 01:15:23.545
- Maybe you'll get lucky.

1822
01:15:23.545 --> 01:15:25.099
- Maybe.
- Ready?

1823
01:15:25.099 --> 01:15:28.266
- Yeah. let's go.
- All right. come on.

1824
01:15:29.492 --> 01:15:31.462
(John laughs)

1825
01:15:31.462 --> 01:15:33.595
- John. this is Cindy.

1826
01:15:33.595 --> 01:15:35.345
Cindy. this is. John.

1827
01:15:37.444 --> 01:15:40.184
- Hi. I've heard so much about you.

1828
01:15:40.184 --> 01:15:41.135
- Really?

1829
01:15:41.135 --> 01:15:42.917
- No. I haven't actually.

1830
01:15:42.917 --> 01:15:43.750
but I'm gonna go. okay?

1831
01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:46.000
So you kids have fun. yeah.

1832
01:15:47.153 --> 01:15:48.320

Cindy. peed on me.

1854

1855
01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:52.930

1857
01:17:55.697 --> 01:17:56.643
- Steve's new girlfriend.

1858
01:17:56.643 --> 01:17:58.202
- How is that a good thing?

1859
01:17:58.202 --> 01:18:00.984
- (laughs) You see. she peed.

1860
01:18:00.984 --> 01:18:03.029
and then she stopped.

1861
01:18:03.029 --> 01:18:04.105
- Stopped peeing?

1862
01:18:04.105 --> 01:18:06.262
- Stopped having sex.

1863
01:18:06.262 --> 01:18:09.429
three weeks. two days. 16 hours later.

1864
01:18:10.423 --> 01:18:13.663
She's finally done.
- Like for life?

1865
01:18:13.663 --> 01:18:15.299
- God. I hope so.

1866
01:18:15.299 --> 01:18:16.880
- You got fucking problems. man.

1867
01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:17.713
- I don't know.

1868
01:18:17.713 --> 01:18:19.944
it would take a lot
for me to pee on a guy.

1869
01:18:19.944 --> 01:18:20.938
- Really. you should try it.

1870
01:18:20.938 --> 01:18:22.257
You might like it.

1871
01:18:22.257 --> 01:18:23.968
- This boy's a freak.

1872
01:18:23.968 --> 01:18:26.070
- It's no weirder than
John's panty harvest.

1873
01:18:26.070 --> 01:18:27.249
- Panty what?

1874
01:18:27.249 --> 01:18:28.082
- Harvest.

1875
01:18:29.222 --> 01:18:31.550
You guys don't know about this?

1876
01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:33.589
John collects panties.

1877
01:18:33.589 --> 01:18:36.571
He used to take a pair from
me every time we had sex.

1878
01:18:36.571 --> 01:18:40.019
He'd label it with the place.
the time. and the date.

1879
01:18:40.019 --> 01:18:40.852
It was terrible.

1880
01:18:40.852 --> 01:18:42.643
I was spending a fortune on underwear.

1881
01:18:42.643 --> 01:18:44.344
- Sounds like a trophy collection.

1882
01:18:44.344 --> 01:18:46.641
- And that's exactly what it was.

1883
01:18:46.641 --> 01:18:48.138
- You know I still have it. right?

1884
01:18:48.138 --> 01:18:49.727
- Get out. you do not.

1885
01:18:49.727 --> 01:18:50.560
- Sure he does.

1886
01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:53.134
I just looked through
it like two weeks ago.

1887
01:18:53.134 --> 01:18:53.967
- Where is it?

1888
01:18:53.967 --> 01:18:55.634
- It's in my closet.

1889
01:18:58.193 --> 01:19:00.041
- How many did you get?

1890
01:19:00.041 --> 01:19:01.571
- I don't even know. dude.

1891
01:19:01.571 --> 01:19:03.705
- 154.
- No. shit.

1892
01:19:04.665 --> 01:19:05.498
- Yeah. man.

1893
01:19:05.498 --> 01:19:08.916
- Bro. you took 154
panties from that girl.

1894
01:19:08.916 --> 01:19:10.482
- Oh yeah. well. I mean
she was buying in bulk

1895
01:19:10.482 --> 01:19:11.782
at the time. so.

1896
01:19:11.782 --> 01:19:12.782
- Oh my God.

1897
01:19:14.879 --> 01:19:16.933
I forgot how many of these there were.

1898
01:19:16.933 --> 01:19:19.100
- 154.
- Man. I was a slut.

1899
01:19:23.519 --> 01:19:26.275
Nichole Richards. David Coffer's bedroom.

1900
01:19:26.275 --> 01:19:27.858
October 31st. 11:15pm.

1901
01:19:29.563 --> 01:19:31.286
I remember these.

1902
01:19:31.286 --> 01:19:32.119
- So do I.

1903
01:19:34.874 --> 01:19:38.902
- You know. I think we did
it in your car more times

1904
01:19:38.902 --> 01:19:40.564
than we did it in an actual bed.

1905
01:19:40.564 --> 01:19:42.251
- I miss that car.

1906
01:19:42.251 --> 01:19:44.668
- Oh. I don't remember spots.

1907
01:19:49.943 --> 01:19:51.526
You son of a bitch.

1908
01:19:52.472 --> 01:19:53.305
- Look Nichole.

1909
01:19:53.305 --> 01:19:55.555
- Sarah Brand. Sarah Brand?

1910
01:19:57.012 --> 01:19:58.839
And right in the middle
of our relationship.

1911
01:19:58.839 --> 01:20:01.250
you've fucked that fat bitch.

1912
01:20:01.250 --> 01:20:02.146
No. no. no. no I didn't.

1913
01:20:02.146 --> 01:20:03.982
Well. okay. yes. I did sleep with her.

1914
01:20:03.982 --> 01:20:06.026
but no. we weren't dating at the time.

1915
01:20:06.026 --> 01:20:07.845
It was one of those weekends
that we'd broken up.

1916
01:20:07.845 --> 01:20:09.973
- And she did kinda look
like you to be fair.

1917
01:20:09.973 --> 01:20:11.957
besides the whole fat thing.

1918
01:20:11.957 --> 01:20:13.384
but that's an honest mistake.

1919
01:20:13.384 --> 01:20:15.797
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

1920
01:20:15.797 --> 01:20:18.214
- Brooke Peters. Anna Luther.

1921
01:20:19.424 --> 01:20:23.372
Tatiana Cruchev. the exchange student.

1922
01:20:23.372 --> 01:20:25.650
Jesus Christ. you are such an asshole!

1923
01:20:25.650 --> 01:20:26.687
- No. wait. no. no. no. no. no.

1924
01:20:26.687 --> 01:20:28.727
Okay. so you remember when you
wanted to go look at schools.

1925
01:20:28.727 --> 01:20:31.616
so you dumped me so you
could go check out campus.

1926
01:20:31.616 --> 01:20:34.424
and feel what it's like
to be a single woman.

1927
01:20:34.424 --> 01:20:36.793
Oh. what was I supposed
to do to just sit around.

1928
01:20:36.793 --> 01:20:38.104
and wait for you to come back.

1929
01:20:38.104 --> 01:20:40.476
get it out of your system.
- Yes.

1930
01:20:40.476 --> 01:20:44.222
Why didn't you tell me
when we got back together?

1931
01:20:44.222 --> 01:20:46.438
- Well. I knew it would piss you off.

1932
01:20:46.438 --> 01:20:48.634
- Well. congratulations.

1933
01:20:48.634 --> 01:20:50.717
- Nichole. Nichole. wait.

1934
01:20:52.405 --> 01:20:54.655
- You're not wearing pants.

1935
01:20:55.572 --> 01:20:57.962
- Oh. that kinda sucks.

1936
01:20:57.962 --> 01:20:59.451
You just got her back.

1937
01:20:59.451 --> 01:21:02.784
- Thank you Captain Bobvious. thank you.

1938
01:21:05.211 --> 01:21:06.044
Nichole?

1939
01:21:07.137 --> 01:21:07.970
Fuck!

1940
01:21:12.303 --> 01:21:15.317
- All right. I dare one
of you to smell this.

1941
01:21:15.317 --> 01:21:16.234
- How much?

1942
01:21:21.952 --> 01:21:23.084
- Jesus. man!

1943
01:21:23.084 --> 01:21:24.911
Been out there knocking for half an hour.

1944
01:21:24.911 --> 01:21:26.661
why didn't you let me in?

1945
01:21:30.853 --> 01:21:32.120
- Oh shit!

1946
01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:34.218
- Oh. she is not gonna call you.

1947
01:21:34.218 --> 01:21:36.335
- Yes she is. she's just. she's just.

1948
01:21:36.335 --> 01:21:38.191
(phone rings)

1949
01:21:38.191 --> 01:21:39.024
Hello!

1950
01:21:40.402 --> 01:21:42.819
No. no. he doesn't live here.

1951
01:21:44.944 --> 01:21:46.911
- Wrong number?

1952
01:21:46.911 --> 01:21:47.744
- No.

1953
01:21:48.733 --> 01:21:51.804
Yeah. anyways. I gotta
crash here for a few days.

1954
01:21:51.804 --> 01:21:53.626
I need sanctuary.

1955
01:21:53.626 --> 01:21:55.262
- From what?

1956
01:21:55.262 --> 01:21:56.940
- Little miss nympho.

1957
01:21:56.940 --> 01:21:59.023
She's a seminal vampire.

1958
01:22:01.006 --> 01:22:04.276
So is there any way you're
gonna call miss underpants?

1959
01:22:04.276 --> 01:22:06.919
- No. I mean. what do I even say?

1960
01:22:06.919 --> 01:22:07.752
(Steve blows raspberries)

1961
01:22:07.752 --> 01:22:09.429
- You're asking me for advice on women?

1962
01:22:09.429 --> 01:22:11.262
You must be desperate.

1963
01:22:13.617 --> 01:22:16.784
- I'm not getting her back. am I. man?

1964
01:22:18.558 --> 01:22:19.558
- No

1965
01:22:19.558 --> 01:22:22.214
No. not by traditional means you're not.

1966
01:22:22.214 --> 01:22:23.047
You need to talk to somebody

1967
01:22:23.047 --> 01:22:27.205
who actually knows something about women.

1968
01:22:27.205 --> 01:22:30.564
and you need to get me a cheeseburger.

1969
01:22:30.564 --> 01:22:32.064
- Get it yourself.

1970
01:22:32.951 --> 01:22:34.450
- I can't. John.

1971
01:22:34.450 --> 01:22:35.867
I'm in sanctuary.

1972
01:22:41.985 --> 01:22:43.629
- My friends are assholes.

1973
01:22:43.629 --> 01:22:46.212
(bouncy music)

1974
01:22:55.883 --> 01:22:59.412
Well. we're coming up
to the midnight hour.

1975
01:22:59.412 --> 01:23:01.123
the darkest hour.

1976
01:23:01.123 --> 01:23:03.037
The point in the night
where you start to wonder.

1977
01:23:03.037 --> 01:23:05.729
if dawn will even come... Will it?

1978
01:23:05.729 --> 01:23:06.812
Probably not.

1979
01:23:07.676 --> 01:23:10.377
That was "Why Won't I Stop
Crying" by Tweed Jacket.

1980
01:23:10.377 --> 01:23:11.373
and you know what?

1981
01:23:11.373 --> 01:23:13.039
I'm gonna play it again.

1982
01:23:13.039 --> 01:23:14.977
Anybody got any problem with that?

1983
01:23:14.977 --> 01:23:16.508
Didn't think so.

1984
01:23:16.508 --> 01:23:18.925
(Sam knocks)

1985
01:23:20.322 --> 01:23:21.699
Sam. my man.

1986
01:23:21.699 --> 01:23:22.936
You know anything about women?

1987
01:23:22.936 --> 01:23:23.769
- No.

1988
01:23:26.011 --> 01:23:27.178
- Good talk.

1989
01:23:33.417 --> 01:23:36.334
(video game music)

1990
01:23:40.656 --> 01:23:42.867
John. sorry the front door was wide open.

1991
01:23:42.867 --> 01:23:45.285
- Fucking Frank.
- Where's Steve?

1992
01:23:45.285 --> 01:23:46.535
- I don't know.

1993
01:23:47.693 --> 01:23:48.979
- His fucking car is here.

1994
01:23:48.979 --> 01:23:52.229
- Oh. yeah. but I was gonna. oh. okay.

1995
01:23:53.775 --> 01:23:54.608
- Oh shit!

1996
01:23:56.315 --> 01:23:57.148
- Oops.

1997
01:23:58.131 --> 01:24:01.293
- Cindy. what the fuck are you doing here?

1998
01:24:01.293 --> 01:24:03.020
Have you met Betty?

1999
01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:05.965
- Can we go someplace private?

2000
01:24:05.965 --> 01:24:08.033
- I kind of had plans.

2001
01:24:08.033 --> 01:24:11.200
- I'm pregnant.
- I get paid on Friday.

2002
01:24:12.746 --> 01:24:17.005
Look. I've actually given
this quite a bit of thought.

2003
01:24:17.005 --> 01:24:18.505
- I just told you.

2004
01:24:19.729 --> 01:24:22.314
- It doesn't mean I
haven't thought about it.

2005
01:24:22.314 --> 01:24:24.362
Contingencies. okay?

2006
01:24:24.362 --> 01:24:25.560
And I think it's best-

2007
01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:26.795
- I'm not keeping it.

2008
01:24:26.795 --> 01:24:27.867
- No. no. no. listen to me.

2009
01:24:27.867 --> 01:24:30.740
I think that we. what?

2010
01:24:30.740 --> 01:24:32.537
- What do I look like. an idiot?

2011
01:24:32.537 --> 01:24:33.592
I'm not having a kid.

2012
01:24:33.592 --> 01:24:35.852
let alone your kid at 18.

2013
01:24:35.852 --> 01:24:37.377
- What. why not?

2014
01:24:38.826 --> 01:24:41.016
- Steve. you're a loser.

2015
01:24:41.016 --> 01:24:42.664
I mean. look at you.

2016
01:24:42.664 --> 01:24:43.838
You're 25.

2017
01:24:43.838 --> 01:24:45.183
You work at a movie theater.

2018
01:24:45.183 --> 01:24:46.463
You spend all of your time bullshitting

2019
01:24:46.463 --> 01:24:47.465
with your stupid friends.

2020
01:24:47.465 --> 01:24:49.873
and knocking up underage employees.

2021
01:24:49.873 --> 01:24:51.182
You wouldn't make a good husband.

2022
01:24:51.182 --> 01:24:53.019
and you'd be a terrible father.

2023
01:24:53.019 --> 01:24:54.667
and I'm not gonna ruin my whole life

2024
01:24:54.667 --> 01:24:57.383
just to bring your child into the world.

2025
01:24:57.383 --> 01:24:58.806
- But okay. that's not a-

2026
01:24:58.806 --> 01:25:01.212
- No buts. I'm dumping you.

2027
01:25:01.212 --> 01:25:02.842
And I want your word.

2028
01:25:02.842 --> 01:25:05.787
your most serious pledge that
you won't ever tell anyone

2029
01:25:05.787 --> 01:25:07.454
that I was pregnant.

2030
01:25:08.673 --> 01:25:11.579
- Hold on. hold on. that's
not how this is supposed.

2031
01:25:11.579 --> 01:25:13.256
because I thought we-

2032
01:25:13.256 --> 01:25:16.191
- Look. Steve. you have a hot car.

2033
01:25:16.191 --> 01:25:17.613
You bought me beer.

2034
01:25:17.613 --> 01:25:20.042
Dating you made all my friends jealous.

2035
01:25:20.042 --> 01:25:21.802
but I'm getting out of high school soon.

2036
01:25:21.802 --> 01:25:23.771
and there are a lot of
guys who have way more

2037
01:25:23.771 --> 01:25:25.960
to offer than you.

2038
01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:28.795
I want a man who can handle me as a woman.

2039
01:25:28.795 --> 01:25:29.962
not as a girl.

2040
01:25:30.917 --> 01:25:33.222
I'll see you around.

2041
01:25:33.222 --> 01:25:34.055
- But.

2042
01:25:36.064 --> 01:25:40.147
Okay. well you know what
you're fired anyway. so.

2043
01:25:41.174 --> 01:25:43.898
I mean. do you believe that shit?

2044
01:25:43.898 --> 01:25:46.229
Anyway. where were we?

2045
01:25:46.229 --> 01:25:47.396
- Oh. fuck no.

2046
01:25:49.390 --> 01:25:50.307
- What're y--?

2047
01:25:54.212 --> 01:25:56.688
(suspenseful music)

2048
01:25:56.688 --> 01:25:58.438
- What are you doing?

2049
01:25:59.445 --> 01:26:01.464
- Son. is you peeping?

2050
01:26:01.464 --> 01:26:02.297
- What?

2051
01:26:02.297 --> 01:26:04.074
No. it's not like that at all.

2052
01:26:04.074 --> 01:26:05.929
- Look. Willie?

2053
01:26:05.929 --> 01:26:07.125
- No. it's John.

2054
01:26:07.125 --> 01:26:08.407
Dude. I'm in your class

2055
01:26:08.407 --> 01:26:12.793
- Right. John. you can't
be peeping on folks

2056
01:26:12.793 --> 01:26:14.017
when they don't know about it.

2057
01:26:14.017 --> 01:26:15.577
It just ain't right.

2058
01:26:15.577 --> 01:26:16.726
- I know. okay. I'm sorry.

2059
01:26:16.726 --> 01:26:20.173
- Although if you're paid 'em for it.

2060
01:26:20.173 --> 01:26:22.330
that'd be all right. (chuckles)

2061
01:26:22.330 --> 01:26:24.877
Who are you peeping on anyway?

2062
01:26:24.877 --> 01:26:29.061
- Well it. my girlfriend
and I got into a fight. so.

2063
01:26:29.061 --> 01:26:31.703
- Oh. yeah. girlfriends.
that's tough you know.

2064
01:26:31.703 --> 01:26:33.347
I hear that it's a lot of trouble.

2065
01:26:33.347 --> 01:26:35.896
but you know that doesn't allow
you to be peeping on folks

2066
01:26:35.896 --> 01:26:37.154
without them knowing about it.

2067
01:26:37.154 --> 01:26:39.982
especially here on the campus. okay?

2068
01:26:39.982 --> 01:26:42.363
- No. look. I know. okay. I'm sorry.

2069
01:26:42.363 --> 01:26:43.937
- Okay. good.
- It won't happen again.

2070
01:26:43.937 --> 01:26:45.880
- I'll sees you back in class then.

2071
01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:50.130
- Yeah. so Mr. Robertson.
can I ask you a question?

2072
01:26:51.251 --> 01:26:52.501
- You just did.

2073
01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:55.614
(chuckles) I was always
here for my students.

2074
01:26:55.614 --> 01:26:57.005
What can I do you for?

2075
01:26:57.005 --> 01:27:00.613
- So I broke up with my
girlfriend the other day.

2076
01:27:00.613 --> 01:27:01.962
Okay. look. I'm gonna be honest with you.

2077
01:27:01.962 --> 01:27:03.712
she broke up with me.

2078
01:27:05.606 --> 01:27:08.617
It's cause every time
when we used to break up.

2079
01:27:08.617 --> 01:27:11.433
I would just go and sleep with
like half of the high school.

2080
01:27:11.433 --> 01:27:12.963
that was like seven years ago though.

2081
01:27:12.963 --> 01:27:15.542
so I guess what I'm asking is

2082
01:27:15.542 --> 01:27:17.661
how do I get her back?

2083
01:27:17.661 --> 01:27:21.603
- She broke half a school
up seven years ago.

2084
01:27:21.603 --> 01:27:22.662
- Dude.
- That's incredible.

2085
01:27:22.662 --> 01:27:24.245
- No man. we broke.

2086
01:27:25.166 --> 01:27:26.600
dude. nevermind. man.

2087
01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:28.342
I'm just. I'll get outta here.

2088
01:27:28.342 --> 01:27:30.937
- All right. John. John.
wait. hold up. hold up.

2089
01:27:30.937 --> 01:27:33.687
Listen. I know. forget the teeth.

2090
01:27:35.507 --> 01:27:37.554
I can't tell you how
to get your girl back.

2091
01:27:37.554 --> 01:27:39.938
but I can tell you this.

2092
01:27:39.938 --> 01:27:42.174
life is full of crossroads.

2093
01:27:42.174 --> 01:27:45.938
you know. points that make
you a sit up and take notice.

2094
01:27:45.938 --> 01:27:47.518
You got a lot of choices to make.

2095
01:27:47.518 --> 01:27:50.272
and sometimes you make the wrong ones.

2096
01:27:50.272 --> 01:27:54.356
and when that happens you
gotta wake up. you know.

2097
01:27:54.356 --> 01:27:55.757
Re-evaluate what's going on.

2098
01:27:55.757 --> 01:27:56.911
Figure out what you're doing wrong.

2099
01:27:56.911 --> 01:27:59.216
and then get back on track.

2100
01:27:59.216 --> 01:28:00.365
You run yourself into the ground

2101
01:28:00.365 --> 01:28:03.627
you're gonna end up crazy and alone.

2102
01:28:03.627 --> 01:28:04.627
You hear me?

2103
01:28:06.483 --> 01:28:09.340
Good. all right. let me ask you this.

2104
01:28:09.340 --> 01:28:10.840
does she hate you?

2105
01:28:12.096 --> 01:28:13.612
Good.

2106
01:28:13.612 --> 01:28:15.695
Hate and love are the same.

2107
01:28:15.695 --> 01:28:18.225
It's apathy that you can't repair.

2108
01:28:18.225 --> 01:28:21.554
I mean. once that hits. it's
like a brick wall. you know?

2109
01:28:21.554 --> 01:28:23.072
And then you're just left to face the rest

2110
01:28:23.072 --> 01:28:27.823
of your life with all the
hope and glory behind you.

2111
01:28:27.823 --> 01:28:30.080
It'll make you bitter.

2112
01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:31.663
You still got time.

2113
01:28:33.306 --> 01:28:34.473
Use it wisely.

2114
01:28:37.215 --> 01:28:38.298
- Okay. okay.

2115
01:28:39.752 --> 01:28:41.672
- I got my own sociology project.

2116
01:28:41.672 --> 01:28:43.025
I'm working on.

2117
01:28:43.025 --> 01:28:47.275
I'll see you later. Gary. (laughs)

2118
01:28:48.121 --> 01:28:49.622
- What the fuck was that?

2119
01:28:49.622 --> 01:28:51.509
Oh my God (laughs)

2120
01:28:51.509 --> 01:28:52.956

2121
01:28:52.956 --> 01:28:57.889
(depressing Rock guitar)

2122
01:28:59.077 --> 01:29:02.160
- Jesus. what the hell happened here?

2123
01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:05.004
- Man. you guys stink.

2124
01:29:06.035 --> 01:29:08.868
When's the last time you showered?

2125
01:29:09.710 --> 01:29:11.268
- We're out of beer.

2126
01:29:11.268 --> 01:29:13.952
- Yeah. so it's the rest of
Rochester from the look of it.

2127
01:29:13.952 --> 01:29:17.203
- I can see sober at
the end of the horizon.

2128
01:29:17.203 --> 01:29:18.908
and I don't like it.

2129
01:29:18.908 --> 01:29:22.878
- Damn. these bitches fucked
you boys all the way up.

2130
01:29:22.878 --> 01:29:24.950
- How much longer you guys
think you're gonna be at this?

2131
01:29:24.950 --> 01:29:27.158
- I think we got enough sips and drops

2132
01:29:27.158 --> 01:29:29.864
for like two more hours.

2133
01:29:29.864 --> 01:29:33.341
- Well shit. we're not
gonna be here that long.

2134
01:29:33.341 --> 01:29:34.446
- Where are you going?

2135
01:29:34.446 --> 01:29:35.318
(upbeat music)

2136
01:29:35.318 --> 01:29:37.413
- We have a book tour.

2137
01:29:37.413 --> 01:29:38.921
- A what?

2138
01:29:38.921 --> 01:29:39.754
- Yeah. we've been working

2139
01:29:39.754 --> 01:29:41.518
with professor Robertson all semester.

2140
01:29:41.518 --> 01:29:43.202
- Sorry. we couldn't tell ya.

2141
01:29:43.202 --> 01:29:45.048
- What you wrote a book?

2142
01:29:45.048 --> 01:29:45.949
- Yeah.

2143
01:29:45.949 --> 01:29:48.737
What you think we just spend
all our time here? (laughs)

2144
01:29:48.737 --> 01:29:50.413
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

2145
01:29:50.413 --> 01:29:51.895
- Well. we have this idea

2146
01:29:51.895 --> 01:29:54.652
that most people were basically sheep.

2147
01:29:54.652 --> 01:29:56.448
You put them in the room
with an authority figure.

2148
01:29:56.448 --> 01:29:58.437
and they'll follow along
no matter how outrageous.

2149
01:29:58.437 --> 01:30:00.828
or ridiculous that person is.

2150
01:30:00.828 --> 01:30:02.728
- So we took that idea
to professor Robertson.

2151
01:30:02.728 --> 01:30:04.837
and he suggested a grand social experiment

2152
01:30:04.837 --> 01:30:08.254
with his sociology 101 class. your class.

2153
01:30:09.471 --> 01:30:13.138
and thus crazy professor
Robertson was born.

2154
01:30:15.826 --> 01:30:17.459
- Hey. we brought you guys a gift.

2155
01:30:17.459 --> 01:30:19.780
- Yeah. and why do you think we're here?

2156
01:30:19.780 --> 01:30:21.780
Ta-dah. and it's signed.

2157
01:30:23.872 --> 01:30:26.236
Come on guys. don't be
too hard on yourselves.

2158
01:30:26.236 --> 01:30:28.530
You're the only ones who
saw through the experiment.

2159
01:30:28.530 --> 01:30:30.548
Turns out being huge assholes

2160
01:30:30.548 --> 01:30:33.131
helps you see through bullshit.

2161
01:30:34.352 --> 01:30:35.632
- Well. we gotta jet.

2162
01:30:35.632 --> 01:30:38.773
