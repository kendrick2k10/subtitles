You mean her fake fake furs?

356
00:18:41.204 --> 00:18:42.903
[they laugh]

357
00:18:42.997 --> 00:18:45.906
How could I forget?

358
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.918
You know. that sparked
my love for fashion.

359
00:18:49.045 --> 00:18:51.170
You've always had an eye.

360
00:18:51.256 --> 00:18:53.247
Okay.

361
00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:55.749
You were always so fearless.

362
00:18:55.844 --> 00:18:58.094
To a fault. I might add.

363
00:18:58.221 --> 00:19:02.181
You were going to save the world
all while rocking my designs.

364
00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:03.391
Me?

365
00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:08.980
I'll start by saving the world
from people like Dorian Fields.

366
00:19:09.065 --> 00:19:16.404
Yeah. well. if anyone is going
to take him down. it's you.

367
00:19:19.033 --> 00:19:21.659
[Hollis]
Sorry. Late night.

368
00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:25.538
Work or pleasure?

369
00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:27.290
Neither.

370
00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:30.784
Just the creaking sounds
of justice keeping me up.

371
00:19:30.879 --> 00:19:34.589
Keep the coffee hot.
Many sleepless nights await.

372
00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:36.716
For now. let's talk
about our first case.

373
00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:38.125
I filed the will.

374
00:19:38.219 --> 00:19:40.094
Oh. I have that...

375
00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:41.929
Where where where's that?

376
00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:47.268
Great. I have the inventory of
Jeffrey's valuables right here.

377
00:19:49.898 --> 00:19:51.939
Yeah. this doesn't
make any sense.

378
00:19:52.025 --> 00:19:53.641
Why would somebody
kill this guy?

379
00:19:53.735 --> 00:19:55.976
He's got a car and an old boat.

380
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:57.820
Can't be worth more than
$20.000 grand combined.

381
00:19:57.947 --> 00:19:59.155
That doesn't add up.

382
00:19:59.282 --> 00:20:00.323
Yeah. I know.

383
00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:02.325
I couldn't agree with you more.

384
00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:09.081
By the way. I got you breakfast.

385
00:20:09.167 --> 00:20:11.083
Yeah. where is it?
I'm starving.

386
00:20:11.169 --> 00:20:13.044
I ate it.

387
00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:16.255
You were late.

388
00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:20.843
Come on!

389
00:20:21.638 --> 00:20:22.845
Yikes.

390
00:20:23.681 --> 00:20:25.640
Nothing like taking
your frustrations out

391
00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:27.892
on a lumpy old bag
that can't punch back.

392
00:20:32.315 --> 00:20:34.398
You okay. man?

393
00:20:35.276 --> 00:20:37.685
When is it gonna go away. Dave?

394
00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:40.947
You know. I bust my ass
12. 16 hours a day.

395
00:20:41.032 --> 00:20:42.823
Yeah. I follow the rules.

396
00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:47.245
And one lack in judgement. you
know. it cost me my career climb

397
00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:51.999
Well. that error nearly
cost a man his life. Jon.

398
00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:53.417
Internal Affairs cleared me.
You know that.

399
00:20:53.503 --> 00:20:57.463
And you know that other cops
don't care what IA has to say.

400
00:20:57.548 --> 00:20:59.507
Do you?

401
00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:01.375
Come on. Jon.

402
00:21:01.469 --> 00:21:03.803
You get all the best cases.

403
00:21:03.888 --> 00:21:05.379
What's your beef?

404
00:21:05.473 --> 00:21:07.139
Look. it's not about
the best cases.

405
00:21:07.225 --> 00:21:09.850
It's about being respected
by the people I work with.

406
00:21:09.936 --> 00:21:12.228
It's about being trusted.

407
00:21:15.024 --> 00:21:17.149
Patience. grasshopper.

408
00:21:18.027 --> 00:21:19.610
Get to work!

409
00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:26.742
[Rena]
I'm at Kaila's.

410
00:21:26.869 --> 00:21:28.619
Miller. how am I supposed to
know what time to meet you

411
00:21:28.705 --> 00:21:29.912
if you won't tell me?

412
00:21:30.039 --> 00:21:32.748
Rena we have to be careful.
We don't know who's listening.

413
00:21:32.875 --> 00:21:34.834
Okay. well I can't crack a code

414
00:21:34.919 --> 00:21:37.169
every time I need
to talk to you.

415
00:21:37.255 --> 00:21:38.379
No. look. Rena...

416
00:21:38.464 --> 00:21:39.580
Okay. look. Never mind.

417
00:21:39.674 --> 00:21:41.081
I'll just. I'll bring
everything to your house later

418
00:21:41.175 --> 00:21:42.883
and we can just...

419
00:21:44.262 --> 00:21:46.137
Miller. I'll call you back.

420
00:21:54.439 --> 00:21:55.730
Kaila?

421
00:22:04.574 --> 00:22:06.449
Kaila...

422
00:22:11.205 --> 00:22:13.947
[car engine running]

423
00:22:14.042 --> 00:22:15.449
Kaila?

424
00:22:15.543 --> 00:22:17.951
[car engine running]

425
00:22:18.046 --> 00:22:19.453
No no no no.

426
00:22:19.547 --> 00:22:20.588
Kaila! No!

427
00:22:20.673 --> 00:22:22.131
[screams]
No!

428
00:22:22.258 --> 00:22:23.957
[screaming]

429
00:22:24.052 --> 00:22:26.302
No! No!

430
00:22:26.429 --> 00:22:27.386
[screaming. crying]

431
00:22:27.472 --> 00:22:28.679
Kaila!

432
00:22:30.224 --> 00:22:32.475
[sobbing]

433
00:22:37.357 --> 00:22:39.690
[Faber]Ms. Martinez. when was
the last time you saw Ms.Gentry?

434
00:22:39.776 --> 00:22:41.141
This morning at the gym.

435
00:22:41.235 --> 00:22:42.976
Did she seem depressed or...?

436
00:22:43.071 --> 00:22:45.646
She didn't kill herself. if
that's what you're implying.

437
00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:48.824
She wouldn't give up that easy.

438
00:22:48.951 --> 00:22:51.952
Do you know anyone who might
have wanted to see her dead?

439
00:22:52.038 --> 00:22:55.331
Rena and Gene said that Kaila
was doing an expose

440
00:22:55.458 --> 00:22:57.833
on the CEO of a big non-profit.

441
00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.827
Dorian Fields.

442
00:22:59.921 --> 00:23:00.920
[Faber]
Okay...

443
00:23:01.005 --> 00:23:03.330
An anonymous source gave
her some damning evidence

444
00:23:03.424 --> 00:23:05.257
of wrongdoing at the charity.

445
00:23:05.343 --> 00:23:06.967
Fields was pretty
upset about it.

446
00:23:07.053 --> 00:23:07.968
Upset enough to kill her?

447
00:23:08.054 --> 00:23:10.012
It certainly looks
that way. doesn't it?

448
00:23:13.393 --> 00:23:14.975
[Faber] We'll pick this
back up tomorrow.

449
00:23:15.061 --> 00:23:15.976
Yeah.

450
00:23:16.062 --> 00:23:17.678
Why don't you go home
and get some rest.

451
00:23:17.772 --> 00:23:19.146
[Gene]
Let's go.

452
00:23:22.318 --> 00:23:24.110
Call you later. Okay?

453
00:23:28.282 --> 00:23:30.324
So what do you think?

454
00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:35.538
I think that you and your fellow
sleuths should sit this one out.

455
00:23:35.665 --> 00:23:37.865
Your friend really
needs you right now.

456
00:23:37.959 --> 00:23:42.002
And you need to focus
on your bar exam.

457
00:23:43.965 --> 00:23:46.540
You know. it's interesting...

458
00:23:47.385 --> 00:23:50.886
For a man who's so tight-lipped
about his own life.

459
00:23:51.013 --> 00:23:54.473
you sure do have a lot
to say about mine.

460
00:24:03.651 --> 00:24:05.225
[Abby]
Thanks for breakfast.

461
00:24:05.319 --> 00:24:07.227
[Hollis]
Of course.

462
00:24:07.321 --> 00:24:09.396
[Abby]
As lovely as it was

463
00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:11.657
I can't help wondering if
maybe you have something

464
00:24:11.742 --> 00:24:14.535
on your mind besides french
toast and dark roast.

465
00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:17.404
Do you know Dorian Fields?

466
00:24:17.498 --> 00:24:18.497
Of course.

467
00:24:18.583 --> 00:24:21.167
He gave me my first
million-dollar listing.

468
00:24:21.252 --> 00:24:25.212
Sold it after two showings so.
needless to say. he likes me.

469
00:24:25.298 --> 00:24:26.505
Do you like him?

470
00:24:26.591 --> 00:24:30.009
Let's see...he could have gotten
any broker to sell his house

471
00:24:30.094 --> 00:24:31.343
but he chose me.

472
00:24:31.429 --> 00:24:33.888
So. yeah. I love the guy.

473
00:24:36.559 --> 00:24:39.852
I think he might have
had Rena's friend killed.

474
00:24:39.937 --> 00:24:41.854
What?

475
00:24:41.939 --> 00:24:45.599
She was a reporter for News4All.
Doing an expose on him.

476
00:24:45.693 --> 00:24:48.235
Hollis! That's a
serious accusation.

477
00:24:48.321 --> 00:24:50.154
I know. I know.

478
00:24:51.365 --> 00:24:55.117
I told Rena we'd help her
figure out who killed Kaila.

479
00:24:55.244 --> 00:24:57.411
So tell me about Dorian.
Tell me about him.

480
00:24:57.497 --> 00:25:00.873
He's loaded. Connected.
Powerful.

481
00:25:00.958 --> 00:25:02.583
The full trifecta.

482
00:25:02.668 --> 00:25:04.627
Okay. but what about like

483
00:25:04.754 --> 00:25:06.795
loving. compassionate. generous?

484
00:25:06.923 --> 00:25:09.289
Come on.
He runs a non-profit.

485
00:25:09.383 --> 00:25:10.624
Does he use donations
to buy real estate...

486
00:25:10.718 --> 00:25:12.301
Okay. Hollis. stop!
Stop!

487
00:25:12.428 --> 00:25:13.961
Are you sure you
want to do this?

488
00:25:14.055 --> 00:25:15.796
Cause I'm not sure
I want to do this.

489
00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:17.139
-Are you afraid of this guy?
-No. I...

490
00:25:17.266 --> 00:25:18.632
Then what?

491
00:25:18.726 --> 00:25:20.142
Dorian and I move
in the same circles.

492
00:25:20.269 --> 00:25:21.435
I don't want him
to think that

493
00:25:21.521 --> 00:25:23.062
I'm poking around
in his affairs.

494
00:25:23.147 --> 00:25:25.305
It could be very
bad for my business.

495
00:25:25.399 --> 00:25:27.307
And we can't have
that. can we Abby?

496
00:25:27.401 --> 00:25:28.809
Okay. that's not fair!

497
00:25:28.903 --> 00:25:30.986
Some of us have a lot to lose.

498
00:25:31.113 --> 00:25:34.240
I don't? Rena doesn't?

499
00:25:34.325 --> 00:25:36.650
Look...

500
00:25:36.744 --> 00:25:40.246
We're not all as
fearless as you are.

501
00:25:41.582 --> 00:25:44.491
You need to dial
it down a bit here.

502
00:25:44.585 --> 00:25:46.159
Why are you even
looking into this case

503
00:25:46.254 --> 00:25:47.962
when we don't even know
what happened to Jeffrey?

504
00:25:48.047 --> 00:25:49.663
Because Rena's our
friend and she's hurting.

505
00:25:49.757 --> 00:25:51.665
Hell. we're all hurting.

506
00:25:51.759 --> 00:25:55.135
I just can't sit
back and do nothing.

507
00:25:57.306 --> 00:25:59.515
I'll see what I
can find on Dorian.

508
00:25:59.642 --> 00:26:01.559
Discreetly.

509
00:26:08.901 --> 00:26:11.318
[Hollis] So Brian.
You wanted to see us.

510
00:26:11.737 --> 00:26:14.530
I know I just seem like a
guy who hates his stepmother

511
00:26:14.657 --> 00:26:16.523
but that's not the case.

512
00:26:16.617 --> 00:26:18.525
I mean. don't get me wrong.

513
00:26:18.619 --> 00:26:23.414
I do hate her but
it's more than that.

514
00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:27.868
I think she was
having an affair.

515
00:26:27.962 --> 00:26:29.870
Okay...

516
00:26:29.964 --> 00:26:31.371
With whom?

517
00:26:31.465 --> 00:26:34.041
I'd rather not say.

518
00:26:34.135 --> 00:26:36.209
Did Jeffrey know about this?

519
00:26:36.304 --> 00:26:38.045
I told him but he
didn't believe me.

520
00:26:38.139 --> 00:26:39.880
At least he pretended he didn't.

521
00:26:39.974 --> 00:26:42.558
What does that mean?

522
00:26:42.685 --> 00:26:47.187
I think he was planning to
leave Joelle for another woman.

523
00:26:47.273 --> 00:26:49.023
Ano...

524
00:26:49.108 --> 00:26:51.066
What other woman?
Who who was she?

525
00:26:51.193 --> 00:26:52.860
I don't know.

526
00:26:52.945 --> 00:26:54.528
But I'm worried.

527
00:26:54.614 --> 00:26:57.564
I mean. people are
winding up dead.

528
00:26:57.658 --> 00:27:00.567
I think Joelle and her lover.

529
00:27:00.661 --> 00:27:03.245
I think they might
have killed my dad.

530
00:27:03.372 --> 00:27:05.998
Okay. back up.

531
00:27:06.083 --> 00:27:09.084
Who died besides your dad?

532
00:27:09.211 --> 00:27:11.962
Nobody. I meant him.

533
00:27:13.174 --> 00:27:14.581
All right.

534
00:27:14.675 --> 00:27:16.508
What's going on with
my dad's estate?

535
00:27:16.594 --> 00:27:18.802
He said someday he
would leave me his boat.

536
00:27:18.888 --> 00:27:21.680
It's like a hundred years old
and probably not worth much but

537
00:27:21.766 --> 00:27:24.016
I'd like to list it
as soon as possible.

538
00:27:24.101 --> 00:27:26.927
Might be enough cash
to get out of town.

539
00:27:27.021 --> 00:27:28.562
You're leaving town?

540
00:27:28.648 --> 00:27:30.263
Yeah. soon as possible.

541
00:27:30.358 --> 00:27:32.933
That doesn't make you
look suspicious at all.

542
00:27:33.027 --> 00:27:39.907
Well. my mom's
gone. my dad's gone.

543
00:27:39.992 --> 00:27:44.611
I don't really have a
reason to stay here. Right?

544
00:27:44.705 --> 00:27:49.291
So if you could speed things up.
I could really use the cash.

545
00:27:49.418 --> 00:27:50.959
I think Joelle's
probably going to try to

546
00:27:51.087 --> 00:27:53.954
pin the murder on me.

547
00:27:54.048 --> 00:27:57.633
But... Look. I didn't do it!

548
00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:01.303
I didn't kill my dad.

549
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:04.098
I loved him.

550
00:28:11.399 --> 00:28:12.973
[Abby] I take it we're not
going to wait on Rena.

551
00:28:13.067 --> 00:28:14.566
[Gene] No. We don't have
that much time.

552
00:28:14.652 --> 00:28:16.110
She'll be here.

553
00:28:16.195 --> 00:28:17.486
What've we got?

554
00:28:17.613 --> 00:28:19.655
I'm still working on the number
combinations that Jeffrey wrote

555
00:28:19.782 --> 00:28:21.481
in the books but it's
a lot of numbers

556
00:28:21.575 --> 00:28:22.491
and a lot of
combinations.

557
00:28:22.618 --> 00:28:23.984
It's taking longer
than I though it would.

558
00:28:24.078 --> 00:28:24.985
Okay. how much longer?

559
00:28:25.079 --> 00:28:27.246
I don't know. It's a
lot of combinations.

560
00:28:27.331 --> 00:28:29.081
A lot of possibilities
for where they can land.

561
00:28:29.166 --> 00:28:30.582
So. I'm just going
to keep working.

562
00:28:30.668 --> 00:28:31.959
I won't rest until I'm done.

563
00:28:32.044 --> 00:28:33.493
Okay. Okay okay.
Abby?

564
00:28:33.587 --> 00:28:35.996
If you guys tell anyone
this I will deny it.

565
00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:38.132
Dorian Fields paid
off the mortgage

566
00:28:38.217 --> 00:28:40.300
on the News4All
headquarters.

567
00:28:40.386 --> 00:28:41.552
Okay.

568
00:28:41.637 --> 00:28:43.846
Well. now we know who's calling
the shots at that outlet.

569
00:28:43.973 --> 00:28:46.140
No wonder Kaila's
article got shut down.

570
00:28:46.225 --> 00:28:48.642
We need to get to
Kaila's source.

571
00:28:48.728 --> 00:28:50.844
Or at the very least.
find her evidence.

572
00:28:50.938 --> 00:28:52.312
Yeah. but I'm pretty
sure her evidence

573
00:28:52.398 --> 00:28:53.564
is in police custody now.

574
00:28:53.649 --> 00:28:56.016
Either that or the killers found
it when they murdered her.

575
00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:57.067
Hmm. True.

576
00:28:57.153 --> 00:28:59.186
Okay. so where are we
on the Jeffrey front?

577
00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.447
Brian's convinced that
our beloved hero

578
00:29:01.532 --> 00:29:03.115
is unfaithful to his wife.

579
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.357
What makes him think that?

580
00:29:04.452 --> 00:29:06.693
I don't know. I don't know.

581
00:29:06.787 --> 00:29:08.787
But who else is afraid we
might find out Jeffrey

582
00:29:08.873 --> 00:29:11.123
wasn't the saint
we thought he was.

583
00:29:15.045 --> 00:29:17.463
Has anyone heard from Rena?

584
00:29:28.601 --> 00:29:30.225
Rena Martinez.

585
00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:32.895
Dorian Fields.

586
00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:36.190
Please.

587
00:29:44.325 --> 00:29:49.411
So. I was delighted to get
your invitation to meet.

588
00:29:49.538 --> 00:29:53.165
I'm a huge fan of your designs.

589
00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:55.000
So...

590
00:29:56.837 --> 00:29:59.246
What can I do for you?

591
00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:05.302
The question is. what can
I do for you. Mr. Fields.

592
00:30:27.535 --> 00:30:30.035
Let me get a steak sandwich.

593
00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:33.372
Make that two.

594
00:30:47.179 --> 00:30:49.805
All right.
Hope you're hungry.

595
00:30:49.932 --> 00:30:51.390
Thank you.

596
00:30:54.895 --> 00:30:56.562
Detective!

597
00:30:56.939 --> 00:30:58.272
Jonathan.

598
00:30:59.149 --> 00:31:01.149
-Hey.
-Hi.

599
00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:03.476
-How are you?
-I'm good.

600
00:31:03.571 --> 00:31:06.572
You know. just grabbing
some lunch and studying.

601
00:31:06.657 --> 00:31:07.814
Yeah. me too.

602
00:31:07.908 --> 00:31:10.951
Ah. grabbing lunch.

603
00:31:11.787 --> 00:31:14.913
So how much do you know about
Brian and Joelle Wallace?

604
00:31:14.999 --> 00:31:17.157
Look. I thought I told you to
stay away from the investigation

605
00:31:17.251 --> 00:31:19.159
You know. Brian is pretty
sure that his stepmother

606
00:31:19.253 --> 00:31:21.086
had something to do
with his dad's death.

607
00:31:21.171 --> 00:31:22.129
And let me guess.

608
00:31:22.214 --> 00:31:25.165
She's convinced that
he killed him. right?

609
00:31:25.259 --> 00:31:27.968
So any number one suspects?

610
00:31:28.053 --> 00:31:29.336
I don't have one.

611
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:30.596
Really?

612
00:31:30.681 --> 00:31:32.806
Yeah. the case has been handed
over to another detective.

613
00:31:32.892 --> 00:31:34.341
Why?

614
00:31:34.435 --> 00:31:36.176
I'm on the Kaila Gentry case now

615
00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:38.312
since it's been officially
ruled a homicide.

616
00:31:38.397 --> 00:31:40.439
Was there ever any doubts?

617
00:31:40.524 --> 00:31:43.150
Well the manner in which
she died suggested suicide.

618
00:31:43.235 --> 00:31:44.276
But?

619
00:31:44.361 --> 00:31:46.778
But forensics revealed
that she was already dead.

620
00:31:46.864 --> 00:31:49.281
or close to it. when she
was placed in the car.

621
00:31:49.366 --> 00:31:53.201
We just released a statement.
Blunt force trauma to the head.

622
00:31:53.579 --> 00:31:55.037
I got to go.

623
00:31:55.164 --> 00:31:58.624
You should. ah. get
back to your lunch.

624
00:32:05.466 --> 00:32:07.966
So. where we at with
Jeffrey Wallace?

625
00:32:19.647 --> 00:32:20.896
Hollis.

626
00:32:21.523 --> 00:32:23.023
Where are you going?

627
00:32:23.108 --> 00:32:24.891
Hollis!
What's going on?

628
00:32:24.985 --> 00:32:27.319
[Hollis] I got to go Mark.
I'll call you later.

629
00:32:30.574 --> 00:32:32.240
Rena!

630
00:32:32.368 --> 00:32:34.034
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

631
00:32:34.119 --> 00:32:35.827
Come on. Hollis.

632
00:32:35.913 --> 00:32:37.746
You're not the
only super sleuth.

633
00:32:37.873 --> 00:32:38.872
I got this.

634
00:32:38.958 --> 00:32:39.957
Super sleuth!

635
00:32:40.042 --> 00:32:41.792
You know. even if I don't
get the goods on him.

636
00:32:41.877 --> 00:32:43.910
I'll still expose my
line to a bunch of

637
00:32:44.004 --> 00:32:47.089
snooty rich folk who might
just become potential clients.

638
00:32:47.216 --> 00:32:50.425
Yeah. but I thought your designs
were supposed to be high fashion

639
00:32:50.552 --> 00:32:52.085
for the everyday girl.

640
00:32:52.179 --> 00:32:55.588
Well. rich girls live
everyday too. don't they?

641
00:32:55.683 --> 00:32:57.599
Look. relax.

642
00:32:57.726 --> 00:33:01.228
Getting close to Fields
means one step closer

643
00:33:01.313 --> 00:33:02.771
to finding out
who killed Kaila.

644
00:33:02.898 --> 00:33:04.764
Yeah. but how are you
have your designs ready

645
00:33:04.858 --> 00:33:06.692
in time for the event?

646
00:33:06.777 --> 00:33:10.770
I'll put my models in
one-of-a-kind samples.

647
00:33:10.864 --> 00:33:12.772
The rich and famous will
bid on what they want

648
00:33:12.866 --> 00:33:15.117
and I'll make custom
designs for them.

649
00:33:15.244 --> 00:33:19.612
Okay. Sounds like you've
got it all figured out.

650
00:33:19.707 --> 00:33:21.614
You handle this and I'll stay
on top of the Jeffrey case.

651
00:33:21.709 --> 00:33:23.709
Just call us sleuth sisters.

652
00:33:23.794 --> 00:33:26.453
Sleuth sisters... Okay.
[laughs]

653
00:33:26.547 --> 00:33:28.788
What's the next step
with Mr. Fields?

654
00:33:28.882 --> 00:33:30.465
Well. he's coming over tomorrow

655
00:33:30.592 --> 00:33:32.300
to check out the pieces
for the auction.

656
00:33:32.428 --> 00:33:36.463
You know. after a few drinks
he's more a philanderer than a

657
00:33:36.557 --> 00:33:39.891
philanthropist so I'll make
sure the models are on break.

658
00:33:39.977 --> 00:33:42.635
Smart girl. Smart girl.

659
00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:43.854
Ah. one more thing.

660
00:33:43.939 --> 00:33:47.474
Do you have any unused office
space you could spare?

661
00:33:47.568 --> 00:33:49.809
I'm sure we can
figure something out.

662
00:33:49.903 --> 00:33:50.819
I got to go.

663
00:33:50.946 --> 00:33:51.811
Where are you going?

664
00:33:51.905 --> 00:33:54.481
Oh. just...
Happy hour with the boys.

665
00:33:54.575 --> 00:33:55.449
But. but...

666
00:33:55.534 --> 00:33:57.409
Make yourself at home.
Call you later.

667
00:33:57.494 --> 00:33:58.910
Okay...

668
00:34:02.791 --> 00:34:04.824
[Miller whispering]
I don't like this.

669
00:34:04.918 --> 00:34:07.294
[Gene whispering] Why are we
breaking into Kaila's house.

670
00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:09.921
[Miller]
It will just take a second.

671
00:34:14.261 --> 00:34:16.011
[Miller]
I just need a little light here.

672
00:34:19.808 --> 00:34:21.641
[Miller]
What are we looking for?

673
00:34:21.727 --> 00:34:23.510
[Rena] Evidence.

674
00:34:23.604 --> 00:34:26.346
The documents that
she told us about.

675
00:34:26.982 --> 00:34:27.981
[Miller]
Where do we start?

676
00:34:28.067 --> 00:34:30.183
I mean. she's got a
lotta stuff in here.

677
00:34:30.277 --> 00:34:31.193
[Gene]
Well think.

678
00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.153
Where would Kaila hide
something of value?

679
00:34:33.238 --> 00:34:35.906
[Rena] Well she would definitely
think outside the box.

680
00:34:43.332 --> 00:34:46.541
[Miller]
Oh. and here is the box.

681
00:35:10.442 --> 00:35:12.234
Gene.

682
00:35:18.617 --> 00:35:20.659
Miller. Miller. come here.

683
00:35:22.204 --> 00:35:24.621
[Gene] I can't make heads or
tails of this stuff.

684
00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.741
[Miller] Didn't these people
ever hear of digital bookkeeping

685
00:35:28.836 --> 00:35:30.919
and online spreadsheets?

686
00:35:32.798 --> 00:35:34.256
[Rena]
Wait.

687
00:35:40.305 --> 00:35:44.090
[Miller reading] From the desk
of Jeffrey A. Wallace?

688
00:35:44.184 --> 00:35:46.101
[Rena]
We should call Hollis.

689
00:35:50.023 --> 00:35:51.982
Come on. Jon. Hands up

690
00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.776
You always leave yourself
vulnerable. Come on!

691
00:35:55.112 --> 00:35:56.611
[Hollis]
Hey!

692
00:35:56.738 --> 00:35:58.697
You could have told me to
meet you somewhere else.

693
00:35:58.782 --> 00:36:00.031
But then you wouldn't
get a chance

694
00:36:00.117 --> 00:36:02.826
to show off your
elite boxing skills.

695
00:36:02.911 --> 00:36:05.954
Your text said it
was urgent. so...

696
00:36:06.081 --> 00:36:07.614
Yes!

697
00:36:07.708 --> 00:36:11.626
We found these documents
at Kaila Gentry's house.

698
00:36:12.921 --> 00:36:16.289
Yeah. I heard someone crossed
the police line last night.

699
00:36:16.383 --> 00:36:17.624
I should've known it was you.

700
00:36:17.718 --> 00:36:20.126
It was not... me.

701
00:36:20.637 --> 00:36:22.596
Can you just look
at the documents?

702
00:36:22.931 --> 00:36:24.723
I will.

703
00:36:26.059 --> 00:36:28.643
Okay. so you're mad because I...

704
00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:31.104

have the note.

Oh come on. seriously.
I know you have an idea.

Look. what I can tell you. is
that the casings found at the

814

scene were traced
back to a ghost gun.

815
00:42:25.043 --> 00:42:27.293
Maybe someone we didn't
even think about?

816
00:42:27.963 --> 00:42:30.964
Right. But who had a close
enough relationship to Jeffrey?

817

I mean. someone who would want
to kill him to keep a secret?

I got documents signed
by Jeffrey so that Miller

832

can match the handwriting to
the scribble on the note.

833
00:43:28.982 --> 00:43:30.389
Great. What else did you find?

834
00:43:30.483 --> 00:43:33.318
Not much. really.
But I took a bunch of photos.

835
00:43:38.158 --> 00:43:40.408
There's that brandy bottle.

enough relationship to Jeffrey?

him killed to keep a secret?

planning to leave Joelle

845
00:44:03.683 --> 00:44:05.600

What?

00:44:12.359 --> 00:44:14.192
Huh? Oh nothing nothing.

Let's just go.

849
00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:16.694
Okay. Yeah yeah.

850
00:44:32.504 --> 00:44:35.538
[Hollis] Okay. Yeah. I know I
know. It's not your brand.

851

[Abby]
It'll do.

852
00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:39.208
What's with the brandy?

853
00:44:39.302 --> 00:44:43.096
[Hollis] It was Jeffrey's
favorite. And Rory's.

854
00:44:47.394 --> 00:44:50.520
So. listen...

855
00:44:50.605 --> 00:44:54.524
Do you think maybe next time
we could meet for lunch?

00:44:55.694 --> 00:44:58.403
Not 7 a.m. or 10 p.m.

858
00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:02.073
Michael's just.
getting suspicious.

859
00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:05.993
Should he be?

860
00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:12.241
I don't really know how to
say this and sound all dainty

861
00:45:12.335 --> 00:45:14.252
and quiet.

862
00:45:14.379 --> 00:45:17.413
But I'm just gonna spit it out.

863
00:45:17.507 --> 00:45:20.425
Were you and Jeffrey
having an affair?

864
00:45:23.513 --> 00:45:26.422
Jeffrey was my friend.

865
00:45:26.516 --> 00:45:28.725
We talked about our
marital problems.

866
00:45:28.810 --> 00:45:31.602
Maybe a little more
than we should have.

867
00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:33.771
We cried into our drinks

868
00:45:33.898 --> 00:45:36.399
maybe a little more
than we should have.

869
00:45:38.528 --> 00:45:42.605
Is that your answer?

870
00:45:42.699 --> 00:45:45.608
What do you want me to tell you?

871
00:45:45.702 --> 00:45:48.611
Just the truth.

872
00:45:48.705 --> 00:45:50.613
Were you and Jeffrey
having an affair?

873
00:45:50.707 --> 00:45:53.583
It's just a simple
yes or no question.

874
00:45:53.668 --> 00:45:57.336
No. It isn't.

875
00:45:59.215 --> 00:46:02.458
Marriage is hard. Jeffrey.

876
00:46:02.552 --> 00:46:05.628
I mean sometimes I
wish I could just...

00:46:05.722 --> 00:46:08.097
throw in the
monogrammed towels.

878
00:46:08.183 --> 00:46:09.307
Tell me about it.

879
00:46:09.434 --> 00:46:12.802
At least your spouse is a
responsible. upstanding citizen.

880
00:46:12.896 --> 00:46:15.229
But he didn't marry one.

881
00:46:15.315 --> 00:46:18.649
[Jeffrey chuckles]

882
00:46:18.777 --> 00:46:23.780
I don't know what I'd do if I
didn't have you to talk to.

883
00:46:25.742 --> 00:46:29.485
You've always been there for me.

884
00:46:29.579 --> 00:46:33.247
You mean the world to me.
You know that?

885
00:46:50.558 --> 00:46:55.344
Jeffrey was one of the
closest friends I ever had.

886
00:46:55.438 --> 00:46:59.181
He was always there for me.

887
00:46:59.275 --> 00:47:03.653
It wasn't a whirlwind romance.
It was a moment.

888
00:47:03.738 --> 00:47:07.114
And we weren't proud of it. but
we didn't regret it either. so

889
00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:09.859
To answer your question...

890
00:47:09.953 --> 00:47:13.037
It was complicated.

891
00:47:13.331 --> 00:47:16.541
How did you find out?

892
00:47:18.002 --> 00:47:20.336
Clever deduction.

893
00:47:20.421 --> 00:47:23.038
Process of elimination.

894
00:47:23.132 --> 00:47:25.842
Just a lucky guess.

895
00:47:28.763 --> 00:47:30.680
So...

896
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:35.351
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Ask me.

897
00:47:35.436 --> 00:47:38.646
Did I have anything
to do with his murder?

898
00:47:43.987 --> 00:47:49.407
Do you know who killed Jeffrey?

899
00:47:49.534 --> 00:47:53.068
No.

900
00:47:53.162 --> 00:47:55.905
I loved him. Hollis.

901
00:47:55.999 --> 00:47:57.707
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

902
00:47:57.792 --> 00:47:59.241
but I know how much
you looked up to him.

903
00:47:59.335 --> 00:48:01.627
And I didn't want you
to think less of him.

904
00:48:03.965 --> 00:48:06.465
Of me.

905
00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:10.803
We just needed each other.

906
00:48:15.143 --> 00:48:17.685
I understand.

907
00:48:25.194 --> 00:48:27.945
Are you going to
tell the Angels?

908
00:48:28.072 --> 00:48:30.823
The police?

909
00:48:33.494 --> 00:48:36.621
It's not my story to tell.

910
00:48:46.382 --> 00:48:49.842
[Abby's phone rings]

911
00:48:54.349 --> 00:48:55.973
Hey.

912
00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:03.639
Yeah. I'm just leaving
a client meeting.

913
00:49:03.733 --> 00:49:06.484
I'll be home shortly.

914
00:50:41.706 --> 00:50:44.790
What the hell are you doing
lurking around here by yourself?

915
00:50:46.544 --> 00:50:47.877
Are you okay?

916
00:50:47.962 --> 00:50:50.755
Sure. I'm fine.

917
00:50:51.883 --> 00:50:54.800
[footsteps approaching]

918
00:50:57.972 --> 00:50:59.180
Oh. there you go.

919
00:50:59.265 --> 00:51:00.255
Hey.

920
00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:02.591
Hey. so. of course.
Miller called the meeting

921
00:51:02.685 --> 00:51:03.893
and he's not here!

922
00:51:03.978 --> 00:51:05.519
Anybody know what's up?

923
00:51:05.605 --> 00:51:07.429
Yeah. the fact that Miller
called a meeting at all

924
00:51:07.523 --> 00:51:08.564
is weird.

925
00:51:08.649 --> 00:51:09.932
I haven't been home. I
haven't done anything yet.

926
00:51:10.026 --> 00:51:12.267
Well. he called me when we
were in Jeffrey's office...

927
00:51:12.361 --> 00:51:15.696
Wait! What?
You were at Jeffrey's office?

928
00:51:15.782 --> 00:51:17.323
What am I missing?

929
00:51:17.408 --> 00:51:19.116
What the hell is going
on with you people?

930
00:51:19.535 --> 00:51:20.609
[Gene]
No seriously.

931
00:51:20.703 --> 00:51:21.777
Guys!

932
00:51:22.246 --> 00:51:24.246
[Gene]
Oh. there you are.

933
00:51:24.332 --> 00:51:25.873
Okay! I figured it out.

934
00:51:25.958 --> 00:51:28.793
It's a code.
It's a routing code!

935
00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:30.086
[Miller]
You remember the note?

936
00:51:30.171 --> 00:51:32.713
You remember the note that we
found in Kaila's envelope?

937
00:51:32.799 --> 00:51:34.123
Yeah.

938
00:51:34.217 --> 00:51:35.958
I'm sorry.

939
00:51:36.052 --> 00:51:37.459
The handwriting
didn't match Jeffrey.

940
00:51:37.553 --> 00:51:38.961
I didn't find a clue there.
I'm sorry Rena.

941
00:51:39.055 --> 00:51:40.429
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

942
00:51:40.515 --> 00:51:42.131
You kept the note. Miller?

943
00:51:42.225 --> 00:51:44.466
I thought we gave
everything to Faber.

944
00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:46.802
Yeah. No. Just this one.

945
00:51:46.896 --> 00:51:48.104
You can get mad
at me later. okay?

946
00:51:48.189 --> 00:51:49.063
This is bigger than this.

947
00:51:49.148 --> 00:51:50.439
So so. I was going
through the numbers.

948
00:51:50.525 --> 00:51:51.807
I was going through
the numbers.

949
00:51:51.901 --> 00:51:53.400
I had so many notepads. so many
numbers. so many combinations.

950
00:51:53.486 --> 00:51:55.477
It was kind of fun at first but
then I was like I'm not sure

951
00:51:55.571 --> 00:51:56.654
if I want to do this anymore.

952
00:51:56.781 --> 00:51:58.656
But then I picked this up
to do the comparison of the

953
00:51:58.783 --> 00:52:00.324
handwriting and when I turned it
over there's all this scribbling

954
00:52:00.451 --> 00:52:01.492
on the back of the note.

955
00:52:01.619 --> 00:52:02.660
All this scribbling.

956
00:52:02.787 --> 00:52:07.456
But here I found the
numbers 702 214 75702 2154075.

957
00:52:07.542 --> 00:52:08.916
What does it mean?
Is it a phone number?

958
00:52:09.001 --> 00:52:10.251
No it's not a phone number.

959
00:52:10.336 --> 00:52:13.129
It's a routing code to a bank
account in the Cayman Islands.

960
00:52:13.214 --> 00:52:17.508
Jeffrey owns it and it's got a
balance of $5 million dollars.

961
00:52:18.386 --> 00:52:20.094
Are you sure?

962
00:52:20.179 --> 00:52:22.596
Where the hell would
Jeffrey get $5 million?

963
00:52:22.682 --> 00:52:25.099
Why would he keep it in
an offshore account?

964
00:52:25.184 --> 00:52:27.768
Clearly because he didn't
want anyone to know about it!

965
00:52:27.854 --> 00:52:29.511
Maybe it was some
kind of payoff?

966
00:52:29.605 --> 00:52:32.356
No! Jeffrey would never
take a payoff. Okay.

967
00:52:32.483 --> 00:52:33.732
There must be some
other explanation.

968
00:52:33.818 --> 00:52:37.853
But guys! Why would there be a
page from Jeffrey's notepad

969
00:52:37.947 --> 00:52:39.855
found amongst Kaila's stuff?

970
00:52:39.949 --> 00:52:41.949
With Kaila's name
and address on it.

971
00:52:42.034 --> 00:52:43.492
But Jeffrey didn't write it.

972
00:52:43.578 --> 00:52:45.194
[Abby]
Then who did?

973
00:52:45.288 --> 00:52:48.363
It had to be someone who had
access to Jeffrey's office.

974
00:52:48.457 --> 00:52:50.532
Yeah. maybe his wife.
Or his son.

975
00:52:50.626 --> 00:52:51.876
Yeah.

976
00:52:52.003 --> 00:52:53.535
Well. what do we do?

977
00:52:53.629 --> 00:52:55.204
[Abby] We're going to keep it
under wraps

978
00:52:55.298 --> 00:52:57.706
until we get more
information.

979
00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:59.383
I cannot keep it under wraps!
Okay?

980
00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:01.210
I'm handling Jeffrey's estate.

981
00:53:01.304 --> 00:53:04.713
I have a fiduciary
responsibility to his family.

982
00:53:04.807 --> 00:53:07.683
I assume they already know.
Right?

983
00:53:07.768 --> 00:53:09.643
[Gene]
What if they do?

984
00:53:09.729 --> 00:53:12.396
What if that's why
he was murdered?

985
00:53:13.733 --> 00:53:15.057
Okay.

986
00:53:15.151 --> 00:53:16.558
I'll keep the note a secret

987
00:53:16.652 --> 00:53:19.228
but I have to tell them
about the money. Okay?

988
00:53:19.322 --> 00:53:21.063
I can't afford for this
to come back and bite me.

989
00:53:21.157 --> 00:53:22.364
I'm trying to pass the bar...

990
00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:23.699
[Abby] Of course. of course.
Do what you gotta do. Hollis.

991
00:53:23.784 --> 00:53:27.411
We'll just let the chips
fall where they may.

992
00:53:34.712 --> 00:53:36.337
Bye.

993
00:53:41.677 --> 00:53:43.418
Hollis. nice find!

994
00:53:43.512 --> 00:53:46.013
I know. Right?
This place is great.

995
00:53:46.098 --> 00:53:47.014
Whoo!

996
00:53:47.099 --> 00:53:48.891
She did good!

997
00:53:52.521 --> 00:53:55.856
Oh. I told Joelle and Brian
we wanted to talk to them.

998
00:53:55.942 --> 00:53:59.318
Do you think they knew
about the offshore accounts?

999
00:53:59.904 --> 00:54:01.570
We'll find out soon enough.

1000
00:54:01.656 --> 00:54:02.437
I suppose we...

1001
00:54:02.531 --> 00:54:04.573
[Rena]
Hollis? Is that you?

1002
00:54:05.076 --> 00:54:08.610
It's her. The girl
from your hearing.

1003
00:54:08.955 --> 00:54:10.279
-Hi Rena!
-Hey girl.

1004
00:54:10.373 --> 00:54:11.914
Oh by the way. that's Mark...

1005
00:54:11.999 --> 00:54:14.449
The lawyer I was
telling you about.

1006
00:54:14.543 --> 00:54:16.043
You guys met at my hearing.

1007
00:54:16.128 --> 00:54:17.836
-Hey.
-Hi.

1008
00:54:25.471 --> 00:54:27.596
Are you ready to go meet...

1009
00:54:27.682 --> 00:54:29.640
Joelle and Brian?

1010
00:54:30.518 --> 00:54:32.184
Huh?

1011
00:54:35.481 --> 00:54:37.731
Okay. Judging by
your reactions.

1012
00:54:37.817 --> 00:54:40.317
I'm going to assume you
didn't know about the money.

1013
00:54:41.153 --> 00:54:43.821
I had no idea.

1014
00:54:44.782 --> 00:54:46.824
What happens now?

1015
00:54:46.951 --> 00:54:50.786
Well. I'm going to
be honest with you.

1016
00:54:50.871 --> 00:54:54.156
Offshore banks don't have the
best reputation for cooperating

1017
00:54:54.250 --> 00:54:57.793
with foreigners so it may be
a while before we find out if

1018
00:54:57.878 --> 00:55:00.662
Jeffrey even named
a beneficiary.

1019
00:55:00.756 --> 00:55:02.831
Doesn't money like
that usually go to a...

1020
00:55:02.925 --> 00:55:04.499
Spouse?

1021
00:55:04.593 --> 00:55:05.843
Or a child?

1022
00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:08.512
Okay. Let's not speculate here.

1023
00:55:08.639 --> 00:55:10.505
[Joelle] Did the police
know about this?

1024
00:55:10.599 --> 00:55:12.507
Uh... No.

1025
00:55:12.601 --> 00:55:14.852
But. we are going to tell them.

1026
00:55:14.979 --> 00:55:15.936
Yes!

1027
00:55:16.022 --> 00:55:18.230
They're going to think I
killed Jeffrey for sure.

1028
00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:22.351
So. back to this money.

1029
00:55:23.612 --> 00:55:26.989
[Hollis] Can we trust you two to
keep this under wraps for now?

1030
00:55:27.783 --> 00:55:29.074
Of course.

1031
00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:31.693
Okay. your discretion will make
it easier for us to protect you

1032
00:55:31.787 --> 00:55:33.862
and your interests
in this money.

1033
00:55:33.956 --> 00:55:36.040
[Hollis' phone rings]
Oh. excuse me for one minute.

1034
00:55:36.709 --> 00:55:39.034
I just need to take
this really quickly.

1035
00:55:39.128 --> 00:55:41.545
[whispers] Don't leave me
with them.

1036
00:55:41.672 --> 00:55:43.714
[whispers] You'll be fine.
You've got this.

1037
00:55:43.841 --> 00:55:45.132
Excuse me.

1038
00:55:47.887 --> 00:55:49.803
[Gene on phone]
Hola!

1039
00:55:49.889 --> 00:55:53.140
I got some juicy info
on your boy Faber.

1040
00:55:53.225 --> 00:55:56.810
Really? So. what'd you find?

1041
00:55:56.896 --> 00:56:02.224
Well. apparently Faber acted on
a hunch and ignored protocol.

1042
00:56:02.318 --> 00:56:04.059
His partner almost got killed.

1043
00:56:04.153 --> 00:56:07.729
Faber spiraled. Dave
Walker. remember.

1044
00:56:07.823 --> 00:56:09.740
well they were friends
back in Chicago.

1045
00:56:09.867 --> 00:56:11.200
He got Faber to move to Philly.

1046
00:56:11.285 --> 00:56:12.451
Okay.

1047
00:56:12.536 --> 00:56:14.036
He got tried to keep his records
under wraps but. you know.

1048
00:56:14.121 --> 00:56:17.572
some of the cops caught wind of
the internal investigation.

1049
00:56:17.666 --> 00:56:22.002
and needless to say. they
aren't too crazy about Faber.

1050
00:56:22.088 --> 00:56:25.914
I also have a little
tidbit about his partner

1051
00:56:26.008 --> 00:56:27.416
Detective Lincoln.

1052
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:28.759
[Hollis]
Oh do tell.

1053
00:56:28.886 --> 00:56:32.054
[Gene] Dorian Fields donated to
daddy's re-election campaign.

1054
00:56:32.139 --> 00:56:34.756
Lincoln family roots
run deep in this city

1055
00:56:34.850 --> 00:56:38.427
and she's the only one who
hasn't made a name for herself

1056
00:56:38.521 --> 00:56:41.355
in law enforcement or politics.

1057
00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:42.689
[laughs]

1058
00:56:42.775 --> 00:56:45.609
[Gene] So what are you going to
do with all this information

1059
00:56:45.736 --> 00:56:47.361
about your cop crush?

1060
00:56:47.446 --> 00:56:49.613
I don't know.
What would you do?

1061
00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:54.118
[Gene] Hmm...
Save it for a rainy day.

1062
00:56:54.745 --> 00:56:56.778
[Gene] Why do I have the feeling

1063
00:56:56.872 --> 00:57:00.207
that your interest in
Faber's background is more

1064
00:57:00.292 --> 00:57:01.917
personal than professional?

1065
00:57:02.002 --> 00:57:05.295
Okay! So got to go.
Thanks for the info.

1066
00:57:07.842 --> 00:57:09.758
My apologies.

1067
00:57:10.136 --> 00:57:12.761
Okay...
So we're good?

1068
00:57:29.864 --> 00:57:31.488
-[gunshot. smashing glass]
-[Rena screaming]

1069
00:57:50.342 --> 00:57:52.501
Did you see a car or
anything. Ms. Martinez?

1070
00:57:52.595 --> 00:57:54.336
No no. There was
nothing outside.

1071
00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:55.304
I didn't see anything.

1072
00:57:55.389 --> 00:57:56.388
[Hollis]
Rena!

1073
00:57:57.850 --> 00:58:00.509
Rena. what happened?
What happened?

1074
00:58:00.603 --> 00:58:02.102
Gunshot through her front door.

1075
00:58:02.188 --> 00:58:04.012
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?

1076
00:58:04.106 --> 00:58:05.680
I'm okay. Thank you.

1077
00:58:05.774 --> 00:58:07.516
Clearly. someone thinks
you know something.

1078
00:58:07.610 --> 00:58:09.860
that you have some kind
of damaging information.

1079
00:58:09.987 --> 00:58:11.019
Well. we do.

1080
00:58:11.113 --> 00:58:13.489
What about the documents
that Hollis gave you?

1081
00:58:13.574 --> 00:58:15.365
It's a good thing you
didn't get shot over those.

1082
00:58:15.493 --> 00:58:17.117
There's wasn't anything I
found that wasn't already

1083
00:58:17.203 --> 00:58:19.027
on your friend's computer.

1084
00:58:19.121 --> 00:58:22.197
So you're telling me that
Kaila died for nothing?

1085
00:58:22.291 --> 00:58:24.333
That she had no hard evidence?

1086
00:58:24.418 --> 00:58:27.503
Well. it looks that way.
But the killer didn't know that.

1087
00:58:27.588 --> 00:58:31.039
Which also means they don't
know how much you know.

1088
00:58:31.133 --> 00:58:32.299
That's why you
need to be careful.

1089
00:58:32.384 --> 00:58:35.043
I'd hate to see something to
happen to either one of you.

1090
00:58:35.137 --> 00:58:37.888
Which is why I'm assigning
protective duty to you both.

1091
00:58:38.015 --> 00:58:40.516
Look. I need you to keep a low
profile for the next couple of

1092
00:58:40.601 --> 00:58:42.017
days until I get to
the bottom of things.

1093
00:58:42.102 --> 00:58:43.552
No. No can do.

1094
00:58:43.646 --> 00:58:44.770
Yeah. No.

1095
00:58:44.855 --> 00:58:47.055
We have the Fields of Giving
Fundraiser tomorrow night.

1096
00:58:47.149 --> 00:58:48.890
My designs are on display.

1097
00:58:48.984 --> 00:58:51.059
You've got to be
kidding me right now?

1098
00:58:51.153 --> 00:58:53.061
No. she's not kidding
and neither am I.

1099
00:58:53.155 --> 00:58:55.322
We have to find out who
this Joey Barnes guy is.

1100
00:58:55.407 --> 00:58:57.866
I'm sure he's connected
to all of this.

1101
00:58:57.952 --> 00:58:59.401
Well. then I'm assigning
an officer to you.

1102
00:58:59.495 --> 00:59:01.328
I'll take Rena.

1103
00:59:02.665 --> 00:59:04.331
Officer of the law.

1104
00:59:04.416 --> 00:59:05.740
And you know. Hollis
and I. we work here.

1105
00:59:05.834 --> 00:59:08.085
Mark can take me. I'll be fine.

1106
00:59:08.212 --> 00:59:10.245
Fine. Then. Hollis...

1107
00:59:10.339 --> 00:59:12.005
Absolutely not! No.

1108
00:59:12.091 --> 00:59:15.083
I'm not spending my evening
being chaperoned by some

1109
00:59:15.177 --> 00:59:17.252
clingy detective
I barely know. No. No.

1110
00:59:17.346 --> 00:59:18.887
Okay. then I'll go with you.

1111
00:59:18.973 --> 00:59:21.181
And keep an eye on you.

1112
00:59:21.267 --> 00:59:22.849
And you of course!

1113
00:59:24.853 --> 00:59:26.603
Actually. that's not a bad idea.

1114
00:59:26.730 --> 00:59:28.597
Because if something goes
down. you can just like

1115
00:59:28.691 --> 00:59:30.399
arrest the person right
there on the spot.

1116
00:59:30.484 --> 00:59:31.933
Sure.

1117
00:59:32.027 --> 00:59:33.402
Look. do I need a
ticket for this thing?

1118
00:59:33.487 --> 00:59:35.770
Ah. no. I got you covered.

1119
00:59:35.864 --> 00:59:39.274
Actually. do you have a suit?

1120
00:59:39.368 --> 00:59:42.578
Do you own a suit?
Like a nice suit?

1121
00:59:42.955 --> 00:59:44.746
Actually I do.

1122
00:59:46.250 --> 00:59:48.417
Of course you do. Sorry.

1123
00:59:48.502 --> 00:59:50.619
So it's a date.

1124
00:59:50.713 --> 00:59:52.120
[Faber]
A pretend date.

1125
00:59:52.214 --> 00:59:54.423
Protective duty date.

1126
00:59:54.508 --> 00:59:56.008
Yeah.

1127
00:59:56.093 --> 00:59:58.293
I'll pick you up at 7.

1128
00:59:58.387 --> 01:00:01.972
Actually. I'll meet you there
because I might have to help

1129
01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:04.057
Rena set some things up.

1130
01:00:04.143 --> 01:00:05.767
[Faber]
I'll send a car then.

1131
01:00:05.853 --> 01:00:07.561
A... nice car.

1132
01:00:07.646 --> 01:00:09.479
Not a police car.

1133
01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:25.996
[Lincoln]
Ahem...

1134
01:00:28.667 --> 01:00:30.208
Peace offering?

1135
01:00:38.218 --> 01:00:40.260
I didn't realize
we were fighting.

1136
01:00:40.346 --> 01:00:45.340
Listen. I know things haven't
been easy for you around here.

1137
01:00:45.434 --> 01:00:47.676
They haven't been
easy for me either.

1138
01:00:47.770 --> 01:00:50.145
Everyone just assumes I'm only
here because of my father.

1139
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:52.147
So you're not?

1140
01:00:52.232 --> 01:00:54.015
Sorry.

1141
01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:56.860
I forgot we were being nice.

1142
01:00:56.987 --> 01:01:00.689
I know you think you got
stuck with me because. well.

1143
01:01:00.783 --> 01:01:02.991
nobody else wants
to be your partner.

1144
01:01:03.077 --> 01:01:04.526
So much for being nice.

1145
01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:07.663
But. if we are going to
be stuck with each other.

1146
01:01:07.748 --> 01:01:10.290
we may as well make
the most of it. Right?

1147
01:01:10.959 --> 01:01:13.251
Let's prove them wrong.

1148
01:01:14.922 --> 01:01:17.205
You know. as much as
I hate to admit it.

1149
01:01:17.299 --> 01:01:19.591
I do like the
sound of that.

1150
01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:23.378
I know you haven't been
straight up with me

1151
01:01:23.472 --> 01:01:24.805
about the Kaila Gentry case.

1152
01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:28.475
Hey. look. if Dorian Fields is
involved. we need to expose him.

1153
01:01:32.815 --> 01:01:34.106
Okay. look.

1154
01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:36.891
I don't know a whole lot about
Dorian Fields' involvement.

1155
01:01:36.985 --> 01:01:40.395
Not yet anyway.
but. you're right.

1156
01:01:40.489 --> 01:01:42.698
We'll figure it out.

1157
01:01:44.576 --> 01:01:46.618
Partner.

1158
01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:48.995

No.

You listen. sweetheart.

1224
01:05:31.136 --> 01:05:35.305
It won't kill you to hang up the
tough cop routine for one night.

1225
01:05:35.432 --> 01:05:38.475
Especially when you're talking
to one of my biggest donors.

1226
01:05:38.602 --> 01:05:39.968
I don't trust the guy.

1227
01:05:40.062 --> 01:05:41.937
Well. then trust me.

1228
01:05:42.022 --> 01:05:43.438
I know people.

1229
01:05:43.523 --> 01:05:44.806
[Dorian on microphone]
Ahem...

1230
01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:46.975
Good evening. folks!

1231
01:05:47.069 --> 01:05:48.068
[clapping]

1232
01:05:51.031 --> 01:05:55.650
I promise that I will not take
too much of your time.

1233
01:05:55.744 --> 01:05:58.662
First of all. Rena.
How great are her designs?

1234
01:05:58.789 --> 01:06:01.656
Absolutely exquisite.

1235
01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:02.749
[clapping]

1236
01:06:02.834 --> 01:06:07.662
I really. simply just
want to thank our donors.

1237
01:06:07.756 --> 01:06:08.505
[clapping]

1238
01:06:08.632 --> 01:06:11.174
Thank you. We are
so so grateful.

1239
01:06:11.301 --> 01:06:12.667
[clapping]

1240
01:06:12.761 --> 01:06:18.014
And last. but certainly
certainly not least.

1241
01:06:18.141 --> 01:06:20.174
my right hand...

1242
01:06:20.268 --> 01:06:23.311
Joey.
Come on up.

1243
01:06:23.397 --> 01:06:24.345
Come on.

1244
01:06:24.439 --> 01:06:25.355
Thank you.

1245
01:06:25.482 --> 01:06:31.319
[clapping]

1246
01:06:31.405 --> 01:06:32.445
There she is.

1247
01:06:50.424 --> 01:06:52.040
That's Joelle!

1248
01:06:52.134 --> 01:06:53.675
Joelle is Joey Barnes!

1249
01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.677
I know. She was one of the
first people I checked out

1250
01:06:55.762 --> 01:06:57.045
when I was put on
the Wallace case.

1251
01:06:57.139 --> 01:06:58.379
[Faber]
Barnes is her maiden name.

1252
01:06:58.473 --> 01:06:59.547
[Hollis] Wait. hold on
hold on hold on.

1253
01:06:59.641 --> 01:07:01.307
You knew and you didn't tell me?

1254
01:07:01.393 --> 01:07:03.051
What. so you could run off
half-cocked. confront her.

1255
01:07:03.145 --> 01:07:04.561
possibly get
yourself killed.

1256
01:07:04.688 --> 01:07:05.720
Seriously?

1257
01:07:05.814 --> 01:07:07.564
-Joelle?
-Exactly!

1258
01:07:07.691 --> 01:07:09.482
Faber. you have to arrest her!

1259
01:07:09.568 --> 01:07:12.485
I will. but I just have to
make sure the arrest sticks.

1260
01:07:12.571 --> 01:07:14.062
[Faber]
I got to follow protocol.

1261
01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:16.740
[whispers] One more photo and
then I think I have to leave.

1262
01:07:16.867 --> 01:07:18.241
Did you hear about something?

1263
01:07:20.162 --> 01:07:21.903
[Hollis] Ladies' room. Come on.

1264
01:07:21.997 --> 01:07:23.038
I'm sorry.

1265
01:07:25.167 --> 01:07:26.207
Bye bye.

1266
01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:33.414
[Rena] Okay. so all we need are
copies of those fake contracts

1267
01:07:33.508 --> 01:07:34.749
to match Joelle's
handwriting. right?

1268
01:07:34.843 --> 01:07:38.086
Yeah. And if it matches up to
the note on Jeffrey's letterhead

1269
01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:40.421
and the signature on the
retainer she signed

1270
01:07:40.515 --> 01:07:42.015
for me and Mark.
we've got her.

1271
01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:43.058
Perfect.

1272
01:07:43.143 --> 01:07:44.926
-Let's do it.
-Okay.

1273
01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:47.353
Dorian's office should
be around here somewhere.

1274
01:07:50.692 --> 01:07:52.567
[Rena]
Okay. This is it.

1275
01:07:54.988 --> 01:07:56.738
Here. use this.

1276
01:07:56.823 --> 01:07:58.364
It's perfect.

1277
01:08:00.243 --> 01:08:01.659
It's stuck.

1278
01:08:08.293 --> 01:08:10.785
Well. Hollis...

1279
01:08:10.879 --> 01:08:13.838
Needless to say.
your firm is fired.

1280
01:08:17.636 --> 01:08:19.627
[Faber's phone buzzing]

1281
01:08:19.721 --> 01:08:21.304
I'm sorry.

1282
01:08:28.563 --> 01:08:29.979
Before you get any crazy ideas

1283
01:08:30.107 --> 01:08:32.306
you should know I'm
an excellent shot.

1284
01:08:32.859 --> 01:08:34.642
One whimper. scream or...

1285
01:08:34.736 --> 01:08:36.644
[Rena] You're not that
great a shot.

1286
01:08:36.738 --> 01:08:38.488
You missed me last time.

1287
01:08:38.615 --> 01:08:41.116
[Joelle]
I was just trying to scare you.

1288
01:08:41.201 --> 01:08:43.151
I needed you to back off!

1289
01:08:43.245 --> 01:08:44.485
[Rena] And you wanted
Kaila to back off too.

1290
01:08:44.579 --> 01:08:45.912
That's why you
killed her.

1291
01:08:45.997 --> 01:08:47.664
[Joelle]
I didn't want to.

1292
01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:49.824
But she wouldn't stop.

1293
01:08:49.918 --> 01:08:51.835
She just kept
digging and prying.

1294
01:08:51.962 --> 01:08:54.162
She was going to
ruin everything!

1295
01:08:54.256 --> 01:08:55.964
What about Jeffrey?

1296
01:08:56.049 --> 01:08:58.833
Did you kill him too
for the $5 million?

1297
01:08:58.927 --> 01:09:02.679
I didn't know about the
money until you told me.

1298
01:09:05.433 --> 01:09:09.435
We could have had the
life I always wanted.

1299
01:09:09.521 --> 01:09:12.021
But he chose to keep
it hidden away from me.

1300
01:09:12.149 --> 01:09:14.107
Why would he do that?

1301
01:09:14.192 --> 01:09:18.278
So you turned to Dorian.
your partner in crime.

1302
01:09:20.407 --> 01:09:21.856
Yes.

1303
01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:24.692
But I fell in love with the guy.

1304
01:09:24.786 --> 01:09:25.785
[Hollis]
What about poor Jeffrey?

1305
01:09:25.871 --> 01:09:29.289
Did you even consider
him in any of this?

1306
01:09:31.626 --> 01:09:35.036
Jeffrey was my white knight.

1307
01:09:35.130 --> 01:09:41.876
He taught me to dream of
a better life for myself.

1308
01:09:41.970 --> 01:09:44.554
But he could never
give it to me.

1309
01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:48.683
Or he chose not to.

1310
01:09:49.561 --> 01:09:52.386
Joelle. you don't
have to do this.

1311
01:09:53.398 --> 01:09:56.065
This is the only thing I can do.
I'm sorry Hollis.

1312
01:09:56.193 --> 01:09:57.400
[Joelle screams]

1313
01:10:01.323 --> 01:10:05.867
[Hollis] Rena. Rena.
Look at me. Look at me!

1314
01:10:05.952 --> 01:10:08.077
Rena look at me.

1315
01:10:09.539 --> 01:10:12.916
Kaila would not
want you to do this.

1316
01:10:13.043 --> 01:10:14.667
Don't do it.

1317
01:10:37.651 --> 01:10:41.736
Breathe. Come on. Rena. breathe.
I got you. I got you. Breathe.

1318
01:10:45.617 --> 01:10:48.451
-[Rena sobs]
-Breathe. come on. Breathe.

1319
01:11:02.926 --> 01:11:04.050
-Hi.
-Hi.

1320
01:11:04.135 --> 01:11:05.960
-What is going on here?
-We're just going to have...

1321
01:11:06.054 --> 01:11:07.804
This is very embarrassing.
I actually have...

1322
01:11:07.931 --> 01:11:09.222
I'm just going to
slip out for a sec...

1323
01:11:09.307 --> 01:11:11.266
We're just going to
have a little talk.

1324
01:11:11.351 --> 01:11:12.800
Right...

1325
01:11:12.894 --> 01:11:14.310
At the station.
Take him to the station.

1326
01:11:14.437 --> 01:11:15.603
I was just going to say...
All right.

1327
01:11:15.689 --> 01:11:17.355
-Okay.
-Okay.

1328
01:11:22.612 --> 01:11:25.146
[Dave] What the hell are
you doing. Jon?

1329
01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:27.907
[Faber]Joelle has just confessed
to killing Kaila Gentry.

1330
01:11:27.993 --> 01:11:31.286
She also set up a raft
of fraudulent activities

1331
01:11:31.371 --> 01:11:33.821
within the Fields Of
Giving organization.

1332
01:11:33.915 --> 01:11:35.323
I hope you know
what you're doing.

1333
01:11:35.417 --> 01:11:36.833
We have a recorded confession.

1334
01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:39.160
You better do
everything by the book.

1335
01:11:39.254 --> 01:11:41.337
Our butts are going to
be on the line for this.

1336
01:11:41.464 --> 01:11:42.422
Understood.

1337
01:11:42.507 --> 01:11:44.966
I'm going back to the station.
See you there.

1338
01:11:50.348 --> 01:11:52.140
Hey hey hey.
Are you guys okay?

1339
01:11:52.225 --> 01:11:53.558
What happened?

1340
01:11:53.643 --> 01:11:54.675
Everything!

1341
01:11:54.769 --> 01:11:57.345
I got justice for my girl.
Thanks to this one.

1342
01:11:57.439 --> 01:11:59.605
We did it together.

1343
01:11:59.691 --> 01:12:01.232
And now we finally know

1344
01:12:01.318 --> 01:12:03.818
why Kaila's name was
in Jeffrey's notebook.

1345
01:12:03.903 --> 01:12:06.020
Joelle put it on there.

1346
01:12:06.114 --> 01:12:07.655
Joelle said she didn't kill him.

1347
01:12:07.741 --> 01:12:10.199
And she didn't know anything
about the $5 million.

1348
01:12:10.327 --> 01:12:14.996
Then who killed him.
And why?

1349
01:12:16.374 --> 01:12:17.498
I'm going to go.

1350
01:12:17.584 --> 01:12:19.542
Wait. What?
Where are you going?

1351
01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:21.627
To the police station.

1352
01:12:21.713 --> 01:12:24.380
I have a feeling that Kaila's
death and Jeffrey's death

1353
01:12:24.507 --> 01:12:27.041
are more closely linked
than we realize.

1354
01:12:27.135 --> 01:12:29.677
Got to get justice
for Jeffrey too.

1355
01:12:31.056 --> 01:12:34.182
[indistinct instructions]

1356
01:12:36.019 --> 01:12:37.226
Okay. Are you ready?

1357
01:12:37.354 --> 01:12:38.386
What are you doing?

1358
01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:39.387
I'm coming with you.

1359
01:12:39.481 --> 01:12:41.731
No. Hollis. this
is a police matter.

1360
01:12:41.858 --> 01:12:43.891
I still need to take all these
people in for questioning.

1361
01:12:43.985 --> 01:12:46.152
Okay. I'm coming with you.
Let's go.

1362
01:12:46.237 --> 01:12:48.062
No. you're not.
You're going home.

1363
01:12:48.156 --> 01:12:50.064
I can't...

1364
01:12:50.158 --> 01:12:52.867
Because you're my police escort.

1365
01:12:53.703 --> 01:12:56.237
Fine. Fine.

1366
01:12:56.331 --> 01:12:57.872
But you wait in my office.

1367
01:12:57.957 --> 01:12:59.207
I'm not going to let
any of these people

1368
01:12:59.292 --> 01:13:00.741
get off on a technicality.

1369
01:13:00.835 --> 01:13:03.628
Okay. Come on.
Skedaddle.

1370
01:13:04.381 --> 01:13:06.506
Oh! Remind me to tell you about

1371
01:13:06.591 --> 01:13:09.300
Jeffrey's $5 million dollar
bank account on the way.

1372
01:13:10.678 --> 01:13:13.221
Wait! What?
Five million?

1373
01:13:13.306 --> 01:13:14.931
Hollis. Hollis!

1374
01:13:18.645 --> 01:13:21.354
[Hollis]
Yeah. so. that was my evening.

1375
01:13:21.481 --> 01:13:23.356
Now I just sit and cool my heels

1376
01:13:23.483 --> 01:13:25.358
and wait for the
interrogations to start.

1377
01:13:25.485 --> 01:13:27.527
Wait. Are you in
Faber's actual office?

1378
01:13:27.654 --> 01:13:29.862
-Yep.
-Okay.

1379
01:13:29.989 --> 01:13:31.697
That station should have
a wired closed circuit.

1380
01:13:31.825 --> 01:13:33.524
Do you have access
to his computer?

1381
01:13:33.618 --> 01:13:35.326
Kind of.

1382
01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:42.333
Okay. look for a tab
that says conferencing.

1383
01:13:42.419 --> 01:13:44.368
You should be able to
scroll through the cameras.

1384
01:13:44.462 --> 01:13:46.421
Let me see. Let me see.

1385
01:13:49.676 --> 01:13:51.542
Miller. you're a genius.

1386
01:13:51.636 --> 01:13:53.594
[Miller]
Thanks. I know.

1387
01:13:54.597 --> 01:13:56.881
We still need to figure
out who killed Jeffrey?

1388
01:13:57.559 --> 01:13:59.350
Shh! Shh! I'll put you
on speaker phone.

1389
01:13:59.436 --> 01:14:00.768
We might find out.
Hold on. hold on.

1390
01:14:03.148 --> 01:14:06.566
[Faber] Well. Mr. Fields.
Your lawyer is on her way.

1391
01:14:06.693 --> 01:14:08.526
[Dorian] Great. Great great.

1392
01:14:08.611 --> 01:14:11.279
Is there anything you'd like to
share with us in the meantime?

1393
01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:16.826
Anything that Joey. I'm
sorry. Joelle. was up to.

1394
01:14:16.911 --> 01:14:19.737
was definitely not at
my level of review.

1395
01:14:19.831 --> 01:14:20.913
Hmmm.

1396
01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:24.542
Were you having intimate
relations with Joelle Wallace.

1397
01:14:24.627 --> 01:14:26.127
aka Joey Barnes?

1398
01:14:26.212 --> 01:14:30.089
[scoffs] No. No.

1399
01:14:30.216 --> 01:14:32.750
No. It wasn't that.

1400
01:14:32.844 --> 01:14:39.765
So if we get a search warrant
for your house. cars. bedroom.

1401
01:14:39.893 --> 01:14:42.768
we're not going to
find any of her DNA?

1402
01:14:55.408 --> 01:15:00.328
Solicitation. extortion. etc.

1403
01:15:00.413 --> 01:15:04.123
We know you killed Kaila Gentry.

1404
01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:06.283
Did you also kill your
husband to get your hands

1405
01:15:06.377 --> 01:15:08.836
on the $5 million he had
stashed away in the Caymans?

1406
01:15:08.922 --> 01:15:11.172
I didn't know about
the $5 million.

1407
01:15:11.257 --> 01:15:14.634
I learned about it
from Hollis and Mark.

1408
01:15:14.761 --> 01:15:18.846
How did your husband get his
hands on that kind of money?

1409
01:15:18.932 --> 01:15:23.851
I have no idea. I swear.

1410
01:15:26.439 --> 01:15:29.482
Let's talk about your work
with Fields of Giving.

1411
01:15:29.609 --> 01:15:32.318
Did you know that Joelle
Wallace stands to inherit

1412
01:15:32.445 --> 01:15:34.820
$5 million dollars now
that her husband is dead?

1413
01:15:34.948 --> 01:15:36.656
Why would I know that?

1414
01:15:38.284 --> 01:15:41.318
We found this sign-in sheet

1415
01:15:41.412 --> 01:15:44.989
from Jeffrey Wallace's
office from a few weeks ago.

1416
01:15:45.083 --> 01:15:47.324
So what?

1417
01:15:47.418 --> 01:15:49.326
My name is not on that.

1418
01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:51.379
No. it's not.

1419
01:15:51.464 --> 01:15:55.967
You did fake your name but you
didn't fake your signature.

1420
01:15:56.052 --> 01:16:00.346
See we had a handwriting
expert determine that

1421
01:16:00.473 --> 01:16:05.142
this is in fact your
handwriting. sir.

1422
01:16:13.486 --> 01:16:15.111
[message notification]

1423
01:16:17.448 --> 01:16:19.857
Wanna know what we think?

1424
01:16:19.951 --> 01:16:21.951
Dorian knew about
the $5 million.

1425
01:16:22.036 --> 01:16:24.537
He figured if he killed your
husband. he could sweet talk you

1426
01:16:24.664 --> 01:16:26.247
out of your inheritance and
maybe even get you to take

1427
01:16:26.332 --> 01:16:29.208
the fall for his murder.

1428
01:16:29.919 --> 01:16:33.170
Do you know who Dorian
was when I first met him?

1429
01:16:33.256 --> 01:16:36.882
Small time con man. hustling
people in the streets.

1430
01:16:37.010 --> 01:16:40.720
I built his empire.

1431
01:16:40.847 --> 01:16:44.015
And now he's double crossing me.

1432
01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:47.518
I guess there's no honor
amongst thieves. huh?

1433
01:16:50.315 --> 01:16:54.892
I know how to connect
Dorian to Jeffrey's murder.

1434
01:16:55.153 --> 01:16:56.277
[message notification]

1435
01:16:56.362 --> 01:16:59.063
Oh. bad news for you. Dorian.

1436
01:16:59.157 --> 01:17:01.782
Looks like your girlfriend
is rolling over on you.

1437
01:17:01.868 --> 01:17:04.401
Which is a shame because
I could have sworn

1438
01:17:04.495 --> 01:17:06.245
she was the one who
killed her husband.

1439
01:17:06.372 --> 01:17:08.706
I guess I was wrong.

1440
01:17:08.791 --> 01:17:11.584
But you know what?

1441
01:17:11.711 --> 01:17:14.378
My investigating wasn't
completely in vain.

1442
01:17:15.548 --> 01:17:17.757
What are you even talking about?

1443
01:17:17.884 --> 01:17:19.258
Oh right!

1444
01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:22.803
You see this man?

1445
01:17:24.891 --> 01:17:27.141
His name is John Paluto.

1446
01:17:27.226 --> 01:17:31.604
Now John and Joelle have
a rather shady history.

1447
01:17:31.731 --> 01:17:33.648
She introduced you
to him so he could

1448
01:17:33.733 --> 01:17:36.942
help launder some of your
Fields of Giving profits.

1449
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:39.362
So what?

1450
01:17:40.406 --> 01:17:43.115
He also knew Jeffrey Wallace.

1451
01:17:43.242 --> 01:17:45.951
Maybe he killed him.

1452
01:17:46.079 --> 01:17:49.113
Maybe. he and Joelle did it!

1453
01:17:49.374 --> 01:17:50.623
Wow!

1454
01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:52.833
Now why didn't we think of that!

1455
01:17:52.919 --> 01:17:55.461
It's a really good thing that we
brought John in for questioning.

1456
01:17:55.588 --> 01:17:58.130
Even better that he
struck a deal with us.

1457
01:17:58.257 --> 01:18:00.466
He told us he defaulted
on a loan to you...

1458
01:18:00.593 --> 01:18:02.426
-Oh. he said that?
-And to pay up.

1459
01:18:02.512 --> 01:18:04.962
He offered you access
to a much bigger haul.

1460
01:18:05.056 --> 01:18:08.307
The $5 million dollars he set
up for Jeffrey Wallace

1461
01:18:08.434 --> 01:18:10.142
in the Caymans.
unbeknownst to his wife.

1462
01:18:10.269 --> 01:18:12.302
Now he also told us

1463
01:18:12.397 --> 01:18:14.313
you were planning on
blackmailing Jeffrey

1464
01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:15.806
and handing all of
it over to you.

1465
01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:17.483
-He said that?
-Uh huh.

1466
01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:21.320
[shouting] You do not have
one ounce of proof!

1467
01:18:21.447 --> 01:18:24.198
You have nothing!
This is...

1468
01:18:24.283 --> 01:18:25.991
[whispers]
You have nothing.

1469
01:18:26.119 --> 01:18:27.660
Hollis. I think I got something!

1470
01:18:27.787 --> 01:18:30.830
What what what what?
What are you talking about?

1471
01:18:30.957 --> 01:18:33.657
I accessed the security
footage from Jeffrey's office.

1472
01:18:33.751 --> 01:18:37.161
And using my self-taught
expertise in image forensics.

1473
01:18:37.255 --> 01:18:40.005
I was able to determine that the
video was. in fact. manipulated.

1474
01:18:40.133 --> 01:18:42.499
And quite well. I might add.

1475
01:18:42.593 --> 01:18:45.803
They used sophisticated video
editing software that relies on

1476
01:18:45.888 --> 01:18:49.348
mathematical equations to create
sort of a blurring effect

1477
01:18:49.475 --> 01:18:50.725
that mask reality.

1478
01:18:50.810 --> 01:18:52.893
So wherever I saw the blurred
effects on the video. or pieces

1479
01:18:52.979 --> 01:18:56.021
of video that had been
manipulated or omitted.

1480
01:18:56.149 --> 01:18:59.692
Pieces that show
Dorian at the scene!

1481
01:18:59.819 --> 01:19:02.737
Dorian was quite careful to
allude most of the cameras.

1482
01:19:02.822 --> 01:19:04.697
The artful dodger that he is.
but...

1483
01:19:04.824 --> 01:19:08.033
His reflection.
He couldn't hide his reflection.

1484
01:19:08.161 --> 01:19:10.536
And I caught it in one of the
mirrors in Jeffrey's office.

1485
01:19:10.663 --> 01:19:13.622
Wait a minute! What?
In the mirror?

1486
01:19:14.667 --> 01:19:17.209
We got him. Hollis!

1487
01:19:17.336 --> 01:19:18.878
We got him!

1488
01:19:19.005 --> 01:19:20.880
Send me the footage and
I'll show it to Faber.

1489
01:19:21.007 --> 01:19:22.715
Hurry. okay? Hurry!

1490
01:19:22.842 --> 01:19:24.383
It's already on the way.

1491
01:19:29.182 --> 01:19:32.099
We got him. Jeffrey.

1492
01:19:32.185 --> 01:19:34.018
We got him.

1493
01:19:39.025 --> 01:19:40.900
[Faber] I don't even want
to know how

1494
01:19:41.027 --> 01:19:42.318
Miller got this footage or why.

1495
01:19:42.403 --> 01:19:43.727
We'll get our guys on it.

1496
01:19:43.821 --> 01:19:46.739
You can pretend you figured
it out all by yourself!

1497
01:19:46.866 --> 01:19:48.240
[chuckles]
Sure.

1498
01:19:49.869 --> 01:19:51.452
Some date.

1499
01:19:51.537 --> 01:19:53.287
Are you kidding me?

1500
01:19:53.372 --> 01:19:56.248
You took down two
murderers in one night.

1501
01:19:56.375 --> 01:20:00.336
With your help.
And the other book club members.

1502
01:20:00.755 --> 01:20:02.579
Let's get out of here.

1503
01:20:02.673 --> 01:20:05.382
What's gonna happen
to Jeffrey's money?

1504
01:20:05.468 --> 01:20:07.760
Is it going to be returned
to the authorities now?

1505
01:20:07.887 --> 01:20:13.307
Well. depends on how well
the bank cooperates and

1506
01:20:13.392 --> 01:20:17.061
whether or not Jeffrey
had any final requests.

1507
01:20:17.146 --> 01:20:22.900
Dorian still thinks it's all
going to Joelle but. who knows?

1508
01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:27.071
I had a good night
tonight. Detective!

1509
01:20:27.490 --> 01:20:28.939
I guess.

1510
01:20:29.033 --> 01:20:31.951
Seriously? No...

1511
01:20:32.078 --> 01:20:35.621
Listen. I know what it feels
like to be judged by your past

1512
01:20:35.748 --> 01:20:37.665
and have people think
they know you because

1513
01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:40.125
they heard about something
you may have done wrong.

1514
01:20:40.253 --> 01:20:44.547
But for what it's worth. I think
you're one hell of a detective.

1515
01:20:47.093 --> 01:20:49.969
And a pretty awesome guy too.

1516
01:20:50.847 --> 01:20:52.555
Perfect.

1517
01:20:53.891 --> 01:20:55.766
Come on.

1518
01:21:08.865 --> 01:21:10.480
That was an interesting
evening. right...

1519
01:21:10.575 --> 01:21:11.866
Hollis! Hollis!

1520
01:21:11.951 --> 01:21:12.867
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa!

1521
01:21:12.952 --> 01:21:13.817
I'm sorry sorry sorry...

1522
01:21:13.911 --> 01:21:15.661
No. it's okay!
This is Jeffrey's son.

1523
01:21:15.788 --> 01:21:17.162
-Hey.
-Hi Brian.

1524
01:21:17.290 --> 01:21:22.167
I heard the news. My dad
told me you were smart.

1525
01:21:22.295 --> 01:21:25.504
He knew something was
going to happen to him.

1526
01:21:25.631 --> 01:21:27.715
I tried to save him.
I really did.

1527
01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:30.301
I really did. I'm sorry.

1528
01:21:30.386 --> 01:21:33.262
Stop stop stop! It's okay.

1529
01:21:36.809 --> 01:21:38.183
It's okay.

1530
01:21:54.493 --> 01:21:56.035
[Brian V.O.]
Dear Hollis.

1531
01:21:56.162 --> 01:21:58.028
There are a couple more things
I think you should know

1532
01:21:58.122 --> 01:22:00.205
about my dad.

1533
01:22:00.333 --> 01:22:02.041
I know you still have questions

1534
01:22:02.168 --> 01:22:04.835
and I hope I can at least
answer one of them.

1535
01:22:04.921 --> 01:22:06.337
He told me about the
five million dollars

1536
01:22:06.422 --> 01:22:08.631
right before he was killed.

1537
01:22:08.716 --> 01:22:11.258
He'd taken a pay off back in the
day because he needed money for

1538
01:22:11.344 --> 01:22:14.044
my mom's medical bills.

1539
01:22:14.138 --> 01:22:16.931
I didn't want to say anything
because I was scared

1540
01:22:17.016 --> 01:22:19.558
and I didn't want to
get him in trouble.

1541
01:22:19.685 --> 01:22:21.727
He did it out of
love for my mom.

1542
01:22:21.854 --> 01:22:25.856
And by the way. I
was Kaila's source.

1543
01:22:25.942 --> 01:22:28.725
And I was the one who sent
you guys the group text...

1544
01:22:28.819 --> 01:22:30.778
And the books.

1545
01:22:30.863 --> 01:22:34.740
If anything should happen to me.
son. I want you to send these

1546
01:22:34.867 --> 01:22:37.242
books to the members
of the book club.

1547
01:22:37.370 --> 01:22:39.411
Grab that notepad.

1548
01:22:39.538 --> 01:22:41.538
I'm going to give you
their names and addresses.

1549
01:22:41.624 --> 01:22:43.740
Contact them immediately.

1550
01:22:43.834 --> 01:22:45.084
Ready?

1551
01:22:45.211 --> 01:22:49.579
Abby Caldwell. 2027
Lakefield Street.

1552
01:22:49.674 --> 01:22:51.248
You got that?

1553
01:22:51.342 --> 01:22:53.592
Hollis Morgan...

1554
01:22:53.719 --> 01:22:54.927
[Brian V.O.]
My dad knew

1555
01:22:55.054 --> 01:22:57.972
something was going
to happen to him.

1556
01:22:58.057 --> 01:23:00.590
I tried to save him...

1557
01:23:00.685 --> 01:23:02.893
But I couldn't.

1558
01:23:02.979 --> 01:23:06.605
I've left town for awhile but
I have a feeling I'll be back.

1559
01:23:06.732 --> 01:23:11.568
And you'll be happy to
know I kept my dad's boat.

1560
01:23:11.654 --> 01:23:14.446
Thanks for being a
good friend to my dad.

1561
01:23:14.573 --> 01:23:17.074
He always said you
were his favorite.

1562
01:23:17.159 --> 01:23:19.493
Well you're my favorite too.

1563
01:23:19.578 --> 01:23:22.579
Love Brian.

1564
01:23:56.282 --> 01:23:58.490
Detective Faber.
Am I in trouble?

1565
01:23:58.617 --> 01:24:01.151
Not that I know of.

1566
01:24:01.245 --> 01:24:04.821
I just wanted to congratulate
you on taking the bar.

1567
01:24:04.915 --> 01:24:07.166
How do you feel?

1568
01:24:07.293 --> 01:24:09.334
I feel good.

1569
01:24:09.462 --> 01:24:11.495
You are going to make
an excellent attorney.

1570
01:24:11.589 --> 01:24:14.498
I'm really looking forward to
our professional paths crossing.

1571
01:24:14.592 --> 01:24:16.967
Our professional paths?

1572
01:24:17.053 --> 01:24:19.762
[chuckles] Well. now that
you mention it...

1573
01:24:19.847 --> 01:24:23.348
That 'pretend date' of ours.
it was quite adventurous.

1574
01:24:23.476 --> 01:24:26.018
Indeed. yeah it was.

1575
01:24:26.812 --> 01:24:29.679
I was wondering if you would
consider a 'real' date?

1576
01:24:29.774 --> 01:24:32.941
You know. one that
didn't end in a takedown.

1577
01:24:33.027 --> 01:24:36.019
I'll definitely
consider that one day.

1578
01:24:36.322 --> 01:24:38.030
All right.

1579
01:24:38.157 --> 01:24:39.406
Well. in the meantime.

1580
01:24:39.492 --> 01:24:45.120
I'm just going to sit here on
these steps and enjoy my lunch.

1581
01:25:15.027 --> 01:25:17.152
[cheering. cork popping]

1582
01:25:17.530 --> 01:25:21.615
[happy chatter]

1583
01:25:30.876 --> 01:25:32.242
To Hollis!

1584
01:25:32.336 --> 01:25:35.963
The one to call if we ever end
up on the wrong side of the law.

1585
01:25:36.048 --> 01:25:38.590
-Again!
-Again!

1586
01:25:38.717 --> 01:25:40.259
To Hollis!

1587
01:25:40.386 --> 01:25:41.385
[glasses clinking]

1588
01:25:45.808 --> 01:25:47.349
Thank you guys.

1589
01:25:47.434 --> 01:25:51.770
Thank you so much for
being my friends...

1590
01:25:51.897 --> 01:25:54.431
My family.

1591
01:25:54.525 --> 01:25:56.275
To Jeffrey...

1592
01:25:56.402 --> 01:25:57.767
To Jeffrey.

1593
01:25:57.862 --> 01:25:59.069
And to the Fallen Angels!

1594
01:25:59.155 --> 01:26:00.362
Yes!
