00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:10.468
My curiosity with the unknown
began when I was a kid

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Official YIFY movies site:
YTS.MX

4
00:00:10.552 --> 00:00:12.012
staring up at the stars.

5
00:00:13.763 --> 00:00:15.432
I would obsess over the concept

6
00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:19.728
of whether or not
we were alone in the universe.

7
00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.064
Someone's freaking me out.
someone's walking over there.

8
00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:26.568
And now my two friends.
Jason Mewes and Jamie Kennedy.

9
00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:29.029
are coming along with me
to investigate.

10
00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:31.322
Oh. I see it. I see it.
Right here.

11
00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:32.949
That is not a satellite.

12
00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.492
We're talking with experts...

13
00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:38.621
It's craziness here that you can't
really put into a category.

14
00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:44.085
..searching for
the elusive skinwalker...

15
00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:46.713
I BLEEP saw a skinwalker.
No.

16
00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:48.256
Look. and we got it on BLEEP tape.

17
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.676
..and are hellbent
to find out if aliens.

18
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.303
interdimensional beings.

19
00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:58.391
and other unexplained
aerial phenomena are real.

20
00:01:01.353 --> 00:01:04.481
(THEME MUSIC)

21
00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:24.501
Alright. guys.

22
00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:27.587
I brought you to the Uinta Basin
because this whole region.

23
00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:30.256
you'll see.
you will never go to a place

24
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.303
and meet so many people who've had
so many paranormal experiences.

25
00:01:35.387 --> 00:01:38.640
Most people think
"Oh. it's Skinwalker Ranch."

26
00:01:38.723 --> 00:01:41.351
It's not. it's this
entire basin we're in.

27
00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:43.937
Essentially. we're surrounded
by all these mountains...

28
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.146
Yeah.

29
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.940
..so it's kind of like
we're at the lowest point

30
00:01:47.023 --> 00:01:49.442
in this. like.
valley that we're in.

31
00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:53.071
Maybe there's something here
and we're on top of it.

32
00:01:53.154 --> 00:01:56.574
It would be amazing finding
some evidence of a UFO. man.

33
00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:59.202
I could see the headlines right now.

34
00:01:59.703 --> 00:02:01.454
Yeah. dude. Totally.

35
00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:03.832
I've heard numerous theories
as to what it is.

36
00:02:03.915 --> 00:02:06.918
Some people think that this place
is some kind of ley line portal.

37
00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:09.587
The way it was described
to me is a...

38
00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:11.840
You know what a deck hook
is on an aircraft carrier?

39
00:02:11.923 --> 00:02:14.217
It's those hooks that.
when the planes come in and land.

40
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.844
it. like. slows
the planes down?

41
00:02:15.927 --> 00:02:17.345
Yeah. yeah.

42
00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:20.682
They say that this is a deck hook
for interdimensional travel.

43
00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:22.517
Wow.

44
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.477
So there's so much
magnetic energy here.

45
00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:27.439
this is like an entry
point into our reality.

46
00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:29.441
(LAUGHS)
Oh. dude!

47
00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:31.401
Isn't that...
You just went so deep. so quick!

48
00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:33.111
(LAUGHS)
Love it.

49
00:02:33.194 --> 00:02:36.781
People have seen every sort
of craft imaginable out here.

50
00:02:36.865 --> 00:02:39.242
They've seen the classic
saucers out here.

51
00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:42.370
they've seen the lights
that move really intelligently.

52
00:02:42.454 --> 00:02:44.330
Everything happens out here.

53
00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.211
So. where are you guys at
with aliens?

54
00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:54.215
I've always been open to them
and I totally believe. you know.

55
00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.885
just like you guys do.
and I feel like there's

56
00:02:56.968 --> 00:02:59.429
something missing and there's this
collective unconsciousness

57
00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:01.556
that we want
to find out something bigger.

58
00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:02.682
Mm-hm.

59
00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:04.601
We've all done
a lot of cool stuff. you know.

60
00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:06.770
Movies and TV shows
and it's been great.

61
00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:12.067
But I do feel like I'm still
searching for this deeper meaning.

62
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.318
Yeah.

63
00:03:13.401 --> 00:03:15.487
I do feel like if I found
something like this.

64
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.448
it would make me feel
a little bit more whole.

65
00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:20.283
Does that make sense?
Deep. yeah. yeah.

66
00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:21.826
Yeah. dude.
It sure does.

67
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.538
For me. for anything that's not
right up in my face proof.

68
00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:28.625
uh. you know. it makes me
a little sceptical but I...

69
00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:29.793
Really?

70
00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:32.170
...I feel like it's possible.
I feel like why wouldn't there be

71
00:03:32.253 --> 00:03:34.547
another planet out there
filled with people?

72
00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:38.593
I don't believe we're the only ones.
I think it's crazy.

73
00:03:38.677 --> 00:03:41.429
I think there's nothing unique
about life in the universe.

74
00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:43.890
I just think we don't know
how to find it yet.

75
00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:48.061
What do you guys
know about Skinwalker?

76
00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:51.064
I never heard about it
until last month.

77
00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:52.732
Really?
Yes.

78
00:03:52.816 --> 00:03:56.528
And then since then. four times.
and then you guys hit me up.

79
00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:58.321
Isn't it weird how the world
works like that sometimes?

80
00:03:58.405 --> 00:03:59.572
Isn't that weird? Yeah.

81
00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:01.074
Like. that's just something
in the ether right there

82
00:04:01.157 --> 00:04:02.325
and it was just like...
Totally.

83
00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:03.785
..like you're meant to be here.
I know.

84
00:04:03.868 --> 00:04:05.829
I don't know about anything
about this area.

85
00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:07.706
I don't know anything
about skinwalkers.

86
00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:12.252
You know. of course
I know basic UFO stuff.

87
00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:14.879
So some of the weird things
about Skinwalker

88
00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:18.091
that people have reported are UFOs.

89
00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:21.344
cryptids.
so like weirdass creatures.

90
00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:24.097
Obviously skinwalkers.
which is a Native American.

91
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.768
uh. like a cursed medicine man that
will go and torment a rival tribe.

92
00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:32.272
There's tons of weird
spirit-type things.

93
00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:34.524
People have experienced time warps.

94
00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:38.194
You name it. it happens here.
Wow.

95
00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:41.281
Oh. dude. if we could find. like.
a way to go back in time. though...

96
00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:43.241
We need a time warp.
It'd be so sweet. dude.

97
00:04:43.324 --> 00:04:45.493
Maybe a time where all of a sudden.
we're back at the hotel.

98
00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:47.370
2002 was so much better.
Yeah.

99
00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:49.372
(LAUGHS)

100
00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:51.499
I'll take the '90s.

101
00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:11.519
Let's go for a little ride.

102
00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:13.229
Shotgun.

103
00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:15.774
Gonna go in the helicopter
hopefully to see a bird's eye view

104
00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:19.402
of all these places
all in one shot from above.

105
00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:22.864
Ooh. mic check one two. one two.

106
00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:25.742
So we can get an idea
of what we're walking into.

107
00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:35.126
Yeah.

108
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.046
(LAUGHS)

109
00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:47.597
Look at that. dude.
Crazy.

110
00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:50.350
Um. alright. guys.
so like the whole point

111
00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:52.394
in why we're doing this
is we kind of just thought

112
00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:56.898
we'd get an aerial understanding of
where we're gonna be investigating.

113
00:05:56.981 --> 00:05:59.150
Are we allowed
to fly over these areas?

114
00:05:59.234 --> 00:06:00.443
Yep.
Yep.

115
00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:02.112
You know what
I'm talking about. though?

116
00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:03.905
Oh. I know what
you're talking about.

117
00:06:03.988 --> 00:06:06.408
We're gonna get buzzed
by two F-16s pretty soon.

118
00:06:07.742 --> 00:06:09.035
It's vast.

119
00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:11.079
So do you guys see
why they call it the Basin?

120
00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:13.206
'Cause. like. we're kind of...
Like. if you look.

121
00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:14.791
we're in the middle of a valley.

122
00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:16.584
but it's like the lowest point
in the valley.

123
00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:17.961
Yeah.
Oh. yeah.

124
00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:22.882
So we're gonna loop around
on. uh. McCoy Flats.

125
00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:29.389
This is cool. look at that.

126
00:06:30.181 --> 00:06:32.058
Massive.

127
00:06:32.142 --> 00:06:34.519
Wow. dude. this is the view.

128
00:06:34.602 --> 00:06:36.312
That is wild.

129
00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:39.899
Yup. Skinwalker's right here.

130
00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:45.572
Oh. look at that big circle
right there. guys.

131
00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:47.407
Like it looks like...
Look at that.

132
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.325
It's almost like a big.
uh. what are those called?

133
00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:50.952
The old-school time dials.
Oh. yeah.

134
00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:53.121
Yeah. This is all Skinwalker
right here.

135
00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:58.376
Wow. Yeah. what are the circles for?
That's just crop culture?

136
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.086
Yeah. just agriculture.

137
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.422
Seriously. this is. like. so crazy.

138
00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:05.008
Seeing the whole basin from up here.

139
00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:08.136
I don't know how we're gonna
cover it in just a few days.

140
00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:13.391
Well. there you have it. man.
we got a bird's eye view.

141
00:07:15.143 --> 00:07:17.228
It's very different
from the air versus the ground.

142
00:07:17.312 --> 00:07:19.689
It's remote out there.
there is nothing out there.

143
00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:22.567
It doesn't get any cooler than that.
No.

144
00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.195
You know? It's like
if I was an alien race.

145
00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:27.197
I mean. if you don't want
to be seen. then yeah.

146
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.158
Yeah. this is a place
to not be seen.

147
00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:32.702
Yeah. honest to God.
it looked kind of peaceful.

148
00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:35.538
But it could be one of those things
like that's how they suck you in.

149
00:07:38.083 --> 00:07:40.669
We got to see these
different areas from up high.

150
00:07:40.752 --> 00:07:44.756
but now we have to go. I think.
put our feet down and investigate.

151
00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:46.174
Thank you. sir.

152
00:07:46.257 --> 00:07:49.177
Next up. I've set up a phone call
with a friend of mine

153
00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.637
named Jeremy Corbell.

154
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.889
Jeremy is
an investigative journalist

155
00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:56.685
whose kind of area of expertise
is UFOs

156
00:07:56.768 --> 00:08:00.146
and the high strangeness
that comes along with it.

157
00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:03.316
So I think it's good to kind of
hear his take on things

158
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.068
and. you know.
Jeremy's a straight shooter.

159
00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:07.320
He doesn't deal
in the world of paranoia.

160
00:08:07.404 --> 00:08:09.197
he doesn't deal in the hysteria

161
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.449
that often follows
the subject matter.

162
00:08:14.536 --> 00:08:17.080
(ZOOM CALL CONNECTS)

163
00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.042
Jeremy Corbell. How are you. sir?

164
00:08:21.126 --> 00:08:23.044
Thanks for. uh. taking
a minute to chat with us.

165
00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:24.379
What's up. Jack?

166
00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:26.881
So I'm with Jason Mewes
and I'm with Jamie Kennedy.

167
00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:29.843
and we are up here
in the Uinta Basin.

168
00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:32.679
What do you think
is going on in the area?

169
00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:37.308
The Uinta Basin is a place
where the world is thin.

170
00:08:37.392 --> 00:08:39.144
where there's a perforation.

171
00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:42.522
Credible individuals
on a daily basis

172
00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:45.316
experience and engage a phenomenon

173
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.653
that is not yet well-studied
by science.

174
00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:54.075
And Skinwalker Ranch
was used as a living laboratory.

175
00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:57.704
It is currently being used
as a living laboratory.

176
00:08:57.787 --> 00:09:00.290
The National Institute
of Discovery Science

177
00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:04.210
and then also the government program
were studying and using the ranch.

178
00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:07.589
They would set up
these interactive games like.

179
00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:12.260
you know. jacks and dice and cards.
and they would build things

180
00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:14.054
and they would look
for communication.

181
00:09:14.137 --> 00:09:16.097
and they would get responses.

182
00:09:16.181 --> 00:09:18.391
There were movements
of these objects.

183
00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:20.727
and it's all recorded
and it's very fascinating.

184
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:26.566
Do you think this place could be...
is some kind of weird energy vortex?

185
00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:31.654
The Uinta Basin.
I don't know what's going on there.

186
00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:36.201
But I do know
that if you really dig in

187
00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:37.994
and you spend a little bit of time.

188
00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:40.955
you will see an experience things
for yourself

189
00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:44.918
that will shake the foundations
of what you think reality is.

190
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:48.088
So you believe that there
actually is potentially

191
00:09:48.171 --> 00:09:52.384
physical danger related
to investigating the Uinta Basin?

192
00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:53.551
Look.

193
00:09:53.635 --> 00:09:58.098
Anywhere you are.
there is an element of danger

194
00:09:58.181 --> 00:10:01.184
to. uh. looking
into the extraordinary.

195
00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:06.231
You're entering a zone that
really is like the Twilight Zone.

196
00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:08.900
where shadow and substance collide.

197
00:10:08.983 --> 00:10:12.070
It's mythology. it's physical.
tangible things.

198
00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:14.072
it's things
that we don't know about.

199
00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:15.865
It is a place of high strangeness.

200
00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:20.704
Every single person.
if you can get them to talk.

201
00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:24.749
has a personal story
or knows somebody that does.

202
00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:29.045
Now honestly.
it's so much around that area.

203
00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:32.382
don't try to pretend like we know
what's going on there.

204
00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:37.679
When you go there. remember.
throughout history.

205
00:10:37.762 --> 00:10:41.391
the observer
becomes the observed.

206
00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:42.892
OK.

207
00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:45.311
Yeah. he seems to know a lot.

208
00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:47.313
and I assume...
It sounded like he's been here.

209
00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:51.317
I love that he's saying that
everybody here pretty much

210
00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:55.030
either has a story
or knows someone who has a story.

211
00:10:55.113 --> 00:10:56.948
Well. I think we know
where we need to go.

212
00:10:57.032 --> 00:10:58.533
Yeah.
Yeah. let's do it.

213
00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:00.326
Let's do it.
I'll grab this.

214
00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:02.746
You know. it was good chatting
with Jeremy

215
00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:05.040
and I think it was good for the guys
to hear it from him

216
00:11:05.123 --> 00:11:07.625
because he's at the forefront
of so much information

217
00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:10.545
that's coming out
about UFOs and extra-terrestrials

218
00:11:10.628 --> 00:11:13.256
or interdimensional...
Whatever you want to call it.

219
00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.467
And he gave some pretty
interesting points.

220
00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:21.723
We're about to pull up
to Ryan Burns' property.

221
00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:24.351
Um. Ryan Burns.
uh. has written a book

222
00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:28.188
about Skinwalker and his personal
experiences that he's witnessed.

223
00:11:28.271 --> 00:11:31.608
He's like an OG
Skinwalker investigator.

224
00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:32.901
Hm.

225
00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:34.152
We're also gonna meet
with Ben Hansen.

226
00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:38.156
who was in the FBI for a period
of time and he's a UFO expert.

227
00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:43.411
UFOlogist. and really. uh. has
a grasp of what's going on here.

228
00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:47.791
Alrighty.

229
00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:55.423
Ryan Burns.
(LAUGHS)

230
00:11:55.507 --> 00:11:56.841
Ben Hansen.

231
00:11:56.925 --> 00:11:59.010
What's up?
What's going on. gentlemen?

232
00:11:59.094 --> 00:12:01.429
How's it going. my man?
Ben. nice to meet you.

233
00:12:01.513 --> 00:12:03.014
Jamie.
Thanks for having us.

234
00:12:03.098 --> 00:12:04.474
Jason.
Ben.

235
00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:06.434
Alright. guys. Here we are.

236
00:12:06.518 --> 00:12:09.020
What have you heard of
or what have you seen

237
00:12:09.104 --> 00:12:11.898
within the last year
on this property?

238
00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:15.193
I was with another researcher.
very. very good researcher

239
00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:18.113
and there was three lights.

240
00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:20.615
They were in sort of a formation

241
00:12:20.699 --> 00:12:23.326
and they just flashed us.
about six feet above us.

242
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:24.661
Yeah. yeah.
Woah.

243
00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:26.371
And...
Make... Did it make a noise?

244
00:12:26.454 --> 00:12:28.331
It was totally silent.
Wow.

245
00:12:28.415 --> 00:12:31.292
It went over a little bluff
and we heard kind of a thunk.

246
00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:34.129
And we looked up over the crevasse

247
00:12:34.212 --> 00:12:38.925
and we could see the puff of smoke
or dust where it had landed.

248
00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:42.679
And from that spot.
it's gonna sound crazy.

249
00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:47.767
sort of a amorphous. coagulating.

250
00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:51.396
like. bunch of nanoparticles
just started spinning.

251
00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:53.565
and it turned into a wolf
right in front of us.

252
00:12:53.648 --> 00:12:55.608
What?
Right in front of us. yeah.

253
00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:58.278
Hold on. So you saw
a large cylinder type of thing

254
00:12:58.361 --> 00:13:00.113
and it formulated
a wolf. you're saying?

255
00:13:00.196 --> 00:13:01.781
Yeah. it was like.
if you could picture

256
00:13:01.865 --> 00:13:03.491
a bunch of gnats or bees
or something...

257
00:13:03.575 --> 00:13:04.909
Yeah. yeah. makes sense.

258
00:13:04.993 --> 00:13:06.911
..just spinning and then boom.
No way.

259
00:13:06.995 --> 00:13:09.039
And then what happened to the wolf?
Wait. so then what happened?

260
00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:10.832
So you see the wolf.
you're like. "Oh my gosh.

261
00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:12.083
"Did we see that?"

262
00:13:12.167 --> 00:13:13.835
And then what does
the wolf do. just run off?

263
00:13:13.918 --> 00:13:15.462
We literally came in and. like.

264
00:13:15.545 --> 00:13:17.464
we were so freaked out that we.
like. hugged each other.

265
00:13:17.547 --> 00:13:24.429
At that point. it just
sort of unspun and dissipated.

266
00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:26.473
Whoa.

267
00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:31.644
You know. I signed up for hopefully
seeing some blinky lights.

268
00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:33.730
I did not think this was part
of what it is.

269
00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:36.483
and it is. yeah.
it is a little terrifying.

270
00:13:36.566 --> 00:13:40.320
There's consequences getting to
interact with some of these things.

271
00:13:40.403 --> 00:13:43.907
It's craziness here that you can't
really put into a category.

272
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:45.367
Yeah.
Right?

273
00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.577
You don't get very far
telling these stories at parties

274
00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:51.206
because people can't grasp
the bizarreness that happens.

275
00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:52.624
Yeah.

276
00:13:52.707 --> 00:13:54.751
Why here? Why the basin?

277
00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:57.295
You could go back to the theories
of the Native Americans

278
00:13:57.379 --> 00:14:00.548
and that perhaps it was a curse
that was put on one tribe

279
00:14:00.632 --> 00:14:04.552
against another tribe. right.
and that the land itself is cursed.

280
00:14:04.636 --> 00:14:06.304
Mm-hm. true.

281
00:14:06.388 --> 00:14:08.932
Uh. it's anybody's guess. Those are
really hard things to test.

282
00:14:09.015 --> 00:14:11.643
You know. there are some very unique
features that are only found

283
00:14:11.726 --> 00:14:15.939
in this. this part of Utah
anywhere in the country. really.

284
00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:17.899
You could get
into theories of portals.

285
00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:20.151
In fact. he's got photos of things

286
00:14:20.235 --> 00:14:23.238
that look like have opened up
and things have walked out of it.

287
00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:24.823
That's what I want see.

288
00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:27.033
And. you know. I don't know how much
you filled the guys in

289
00:14:27.117 --> 00:14:28.702
on the craziness here.

290
00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:31.162
but one of the rules. of course.
is you don't dig. right?

291
00:14:31.246 --> 00:14:33.623
Yeah.
When you dig. activity heightens.

292
00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:35.834
Yeah. it means you probably
don't want to be next

293
00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:37.752
to an oil rig digging 24/7.

294
00:14:37.836 --> 00:14:41.631
What I've heard from the oil workers
and some of their girlfriends

295
00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:44.926
is that they leave offerings.

296
00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:47.470
a sandwich or something so that
they don't get messed with.

297
00:14:47.554 --> 00:14:49.889
And it works?
I guess. I don't know.

298
00:14:49.973 --> 00:14:51.057
Wow.

299
00:14:51.141 --> 00:14:53.685
Wow. Interesting. interesting.
A sandwich.

300
00:14:53.768 --> 00:14:55.812
One thing about the basin. right?

301
00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:58.732
It seems like there's an energy.
when you come here.

302
00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:01.818
whatever you come with.
whatever emotion you come with.

303
00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:05.155
if you come fearful.
it amplifies the fear.

304
00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:09.951
If you come here. you know. and
you're a little more. uh. open

305
00:15:10.035 --> 00:15:13.830
and benevolent. it seems like those
people don't fare as badly.

306
00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:17.459
Are there government agencies
out here conducting research?

307
00:15:17.542 --> 00:15:19.294
Or is that just conspiracy theory?

308
00:15:19.377 --> 00:15:22.505
Well. as you know. Jack.
the recent revelation

309
00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:25.925
from the DOD was that right.
they had the. uh. AATIP program.

310
00:15:26.009 --> 00:15:29.512
They put 22 million dollars
into. um.

311
00:15:29.596 --> 00:15:31.890
looking at unidentified phenomena.

312
00:15:31.973 --> 00:15:34.434
That also spun off
something else called AAWSAP.

313
00:15:34.517 --> 00:15:38.021
which was the Advanced Aerospace
Weapons Applications Program.

314
00:15:38.104 --> 00:15:41.441
where they were actually
trying to make weapons

315
00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:43.818
to deal with these advanced threats.

316
00:15:43.902 --> 00:15:47.364
So if the government thinks
that this is a threat.

317
00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:49.908
it's probably a threat.

318
00:15:49.991 --> 00:15:51.534
You actually think it's a threat?

319
00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:54.579
These aren't just.
like. inquisitive beings

320
00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:57.123
from somewhere
or drones or whatever?

321
00:15:57.207 --> 00:15:59.793
It is a bit different than just.
say. having a UFO sighting.

322
00:15:59.876 --> 00:16:03.088
I mean. you gotta remember
what was happening to livestock.

323
00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:04.881
Yeah.
OK. in the basin.

324
00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:08.468
Not just. again. the ranch.
a lot of cattle mutilations.

325
00:16:08.551 --> 00:16:10.804
Uh. people's livelihoods
being destroyed.

326
00:16:10.887 --> 00:16:13.723
And whatever this is.
if it's multiple things.

327
00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:17.519
we don't really know. but it seems
to be toying with people.

328
00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:24.776
So let me ask you.
'cause you've messed around a lot

329
00:16:24.859 --> 00:16:26.319
with this stuff?
Too much.

330
00:16:26.403 --> 00:16:27.904
Are you cool?
No.

331
00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:29.531
So you have issues?
Yeah.

332
00:16:29.614 --> 00:16:31.700
What do you mean. cool?
(LAUGHS)

333
00:16:31.783 --> 00:16:35.078
Well. he looks healthy.
Don't poke the bear. so to speak.

334
00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:36.621
Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.

335
00:16:36.705 --> 00:16:37.872
So. but you say stuff happens.

336
00:16:37.956 --> 00:16:40.834
I clean up nice. but yeah. It's...
Dude. but why?

337
00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:43.962
Why. since this is such
a trepidatious thing.

338
00:16:44.045 --> 00:16:45.296
why do you mess with it?

339
00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:47.382
We are dealing with something
that might be like

340
00:16:47.465 --> 00:16:50.427
an alien artificial intelligence
and they're messing with us?

341
00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:51.803
I want to know.

342
00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:54.472
We want to dive into aliens.
Where do we go for that?

343
00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:56.266
You guys should go to McCoy Flat.

344
00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:59.394
More lights in the sky.
more stuff on the ground right now.

345
00:16:59.477 --> 00:17:01.730
And that's a really active area.

346
00:17:01.813 --> 00:17:04.524
so like Jack says.
this stuff. it just moves.

347
00:17:04.607 --> 00:17:06.151
It's just constantly moving around.

348
00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:09.571
When you say active. like.
what has happened in the last week?

349
00:17:09.654 --> 00:17:12.282
I was just talking
to a guy right over here.

350
00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:15.618
He said he goes out there
with a lawn chair and a six-pack.

351
00:17:15.702 --> 00:17:18.121
He sits down and he says
before he has a chance

352
00:17:18.204 --> 00:17:19.873
to get to his second beer.
the light show starts.

353
00:17:19.956 --> 00:17:21.583
Wow.

354
00:17:21.666 --> 00:17:25.879
I'm hoping that we find
something otherworldly.

355
00:17:25.962 --> 00:17:29.007
We'll goof around. but you know.
when it comes to this. I'm serious.

356
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.759
I'm just an open-minded person.

357
00:17:30.842 --> 00:17:33.803
And there's a lot of smoke
with aliens.

358
00:17:33.887 --> 00:17:37.515
interdimensions.
shapeshifters.

359
00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:40.435
There's a lot of smoke.
I want to find something. you know.

360
00:17:40.518 --> 00:17:43.271
As long as it doesn't mess me up.

361
00:17:43.355 --> 00:17:45.148
Can we circle up
at the end of the week

362
00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:47.192
and we'd love to share with you...
If we find anything...

363
00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:48.860
That would be awesome.
Yeah. let's do.

364
00:17:48.943 --> 00:17:50.195
Alright.
Alright.

365
00:17:50.278 --> 00:17:51.529
Let's hit it.

366
00:17:51.613 --> 00:17:56.451
It seems like whatever
the activity is here. it's all over.

367
00:17:56.534 --> 00:17:58.953
And I think Ryan
made a really good point

368
00:17:59.037 --> 00:18:01.206
that this energy
is a trickster energy

369
00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:03.833
and it manifests into whatever
you fear the most.

370
00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:06.086
So that's why I think
it's so random.

371
00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:08.296
some people fear ghosts.
some people fear aliens.

372
00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:09.839
some people fear cryptids.

373
00:18:09.923 --> 00:18:12.759
and why are they here
and why are people seeing them here?

374
00:18:12.842 --> 00:18:15.470
Are they actually here
or is this energy manifesting

375
00:18:15.553 --> 00:18:16.930
into your worst nightmares?

376
00:18:23.186 --> 00:18:23.447
2
00:17:43.560 -- 00:17:45.640 align:middle line:90% position:50%
So we're just getting
cameras all set.

377
00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:32.987
Check. check. check.

378
00:18:33.071 --> 00:18:35.240
We have a whole massive
area to cover.

379
00:18:35.323 --> 00:18:37.450
Check. check. check.
We got it. it's checked.

380
00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:39.828
Yeah. we got you. you're checked.
Alright. cool.

381
00:18:39.911 --> 00:18:44.499
We've got cameras all around us. uh.
try and get as much sky as possible.

382
00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:49.921
Camera 1 is kind of towards
the end of this parking lot area.

383
00:18:51.965 --> 00:18:54.009
Number 2 is on top of the hill.

384
00:18:54.092 --> 00:18:57.220
3 is facing kind of
towards the moon.

385
00:18:57.303 --> 00:19:01.641
and 4 is way down south.

386
00:19:01.725 --> 00:19:03.852
Really. this experience is more
about us observing the...

387
00:19:03.935 --> 00:19:06.104
How's that? Woodchuck to Squirrel.
Woodchuck to Squirrel. how's that?

388
00:19:06.187 --> 00:19:08.732
Uh. you're looking good.
you're coming in loud and clear.

389
00:19:08.815 --> 00:19:10.483
Good. Let's do a full-on check.

390
00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:16.364
# Yeah. move it like that.
mm-hm. uh-huh. #

391
00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.579
Alright. Alright.

392
00:19:23.455 --> 00:19:26.458
Alright. so I've done
my fair share of ghost hunts.

393
00:19:26.541 --> 00:19:28.293
paranormal investigations.
but I've never done.

394
00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:31.671
like. an official UFO hunt
like this.

395
00:19:31.755 --> 00:19:35.091
I mean. I've done some stuff
but it's been. like. UFO-adjacent.

396
00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:37.635
Well. we like tech too. you know.

397
00:19:37.719 --> 00:19:39.596
for what we call skywatching.

398
00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:42.223
So I asked Ben Hansen to join us
in our investigation

399
00:19:42.307 --> 00:19:45.060
because Ben
is a professional UFOlogist.

400
00:19:45.143 --> 00:19:47.771
He knows how to hunt UFOs.

401
00:19:47.854 --> 00:19:49.230
We're gonna try
different techniques.

402
00:19:49.314 --> 00:19:50.940
he's got some really cool tech
we can play with.

403
00:19:51.024 --> 00:19:53.651
I've got some cool toys too.
so we're just gonna check out

404
00:19:53.735 --> 00:19:56.821
this location
and see if we get anything. man.

405
00:19:56.905 --> 00:19:59.949
This is what I would call
my basic setup

406
00:20:00.033 --> 00:20:01.451
when I do these
things. right?

407
00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:03.119
I use this when I fly.

408
00:20:03.203 --> 00:20:07.707
Basically. this gives us an aerial
view. so if you have anything

409
00:20:07.791 --> 00:20:10.085
that we're seeing in the sky.
one of the first things I like

410
00:20:10.168 --> 00:20:14.798
to do is to eliminate it being
a commercial plane of some sort. OK?

411
00:20:14.881 --> 00:20:16.091
So...
Will that tell you

412
00:20:16.174 --> 00:20:17.425
if it's a commercial plane?

413
00:20:17.509 --> 00:20:20.720
Every plane that's in the area
has to broadcast its data.

414
00:20:20.804 --> 00:20:23.556
If you were to see something
in the sky and were not sure.

415
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.017
we would come to this
and we'd say.

416
00:20:26.101 --> 00:20:28.520
"OK. well. what is there
in the area that's flying around?"

417
00:20:28.603 --> 00:20:30.689
Well. right now.
there is no air traffic.

418
00:20:30.772 --> 00:20:32.065
No.

419
00:20:32.148 --> 00:20:33.858
The plane will give its data
and it'll say.

420
00:20:33.942 --> 00:20:35.652
"Well. that's such and
such airline. Flight whatever."

421
00:20:35.735 --> 00:20:36.903
Mm-hm.

422
00:20:36.986 --> 00:20:38.780
It'll give its altitude.
um. its direction.

423
00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:40.365
everything will
show up here.

424
00:20:40.448 --> 00:20:42.325
That's awesome.
So that's just one tool.

425
00:20:42.409 --> 00:20:44.411
We've got our cameras set up.
thanks to you guys.

426
00:20:44.494 --> 00:20:45.995
we've got some coverage
on the ground.

427
00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:48.039
Everyone should have
high-powered lights

428
00:20:48.123 --> 00:20:49.666
that might come in use later.

429
00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:53.586
We've got radios
to communicate to each other.

430
00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:56.548
I wouldn't recommend
that we split up too far.

431
00:20:56.631 --> 00:20:58.008
No.

432
00:20:58.091 --> 00:20:59.968
Just because of the dangers
of everything that's out here.

433
00:21:00.051 --> 00:21:05.098
But as we go out. we have got
night vision up the wazoo.

434
00:21:05.181 --> 00:21:07.559
Jack's brought some. I have some.

435
00:21:07.642 --> 00:21:10.562
This is military grade.
a new technology

436
00:21:10.645 --> 00:21:12.105
called white phosphor

437
00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:15.316
which amplifies it
about 80.000 times.

438
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.068
Holy BLEEP.

439
00:21:17.152 --> 00:21:19.571
(LAUGHS)
Wow.

440
00:21:19.654 --> 00:21:22.490
Look at the skies.
Wow.

441
00:21:22.574 --> 00:21:25.201
This is insane.

442
00:21:25.285 --> 00:21:27.579
I see so many things
in the sky right now.

443
00:21:27.662 --> 00:21:29.831
like I know they're probably not.

444
00:21:29.914 --> 00:21:32.250
but they look like there's a bunch
of resting spaceships.

445
00:21:32.334 --> 00:21:34.336
What are those flickering things?

446
00:21:34.419 --> 00:21:35.879
Just stars.

447
00:21:35.962 --> 00:21:38.256
The night vision is insane.

448
00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:41.301
To put those on
and just to be able to just see

449
00:21:41.384 --> 00:21:44.179
not only far but details.

450
00:21:45.305 --> 00:21:47.098
It's like looking in the day.

451
00:21:47.182 --> 00:21:50.393
Imagine seeing something
coming at you like rawr.

452
00:21:50.477 --> 00:21:52.354
I know.
(LAUGHS)

453
00:21:52.437 --> 00:21:55.690
So we have the night
vision to look up and see...

454
00:21:55.774 --> 00:21:59.027
Hopefully we have lights to see
where we're going. compasses.

455
00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.489
Basically tonight. we just want
to keep our eyes and ears open.

456
00:22:02.572 --> 00:22:05.325
see what's out there.
see if we can see anything. right?

457
00:22:05.408 --> 00:22:07.994
That's. that's the game plan.
Alright. let's do it.

458
00:22:08.078 --> 00:22:09.954
Go. fight. win?
Yes.

459
00:22:10.038 --> 00:22:12.582
Uh. uh. Skinwalker.
Skinwalkers!

460
00:22:17.504 --> 00:22:18.922
There you go.

461
00:22:19.964 --> 00:22:21.341
You got a chair?
I'm good.

462
00:22:21.424 --> 00:22:23.843
Alright. have we got the night vizh?
We got the thermals.

463
00:22:24.761 --> 00:22:26.513
Let's go!

464
00:22:26.596 --> 00:22:29.641
Not that I know where I'm going.
but come on and follow me.

465
00:22:30.475 --> 00:22:32.977
Oh. that's good.
(LAUGHS)

466
00:22:36.022 --> 00:22:38.400
I think this is good.
I like this 'cause it's flat.

467
00:22:38.483 --> 00:22:40.318
Alright.

468
00:22:40.402 --> 00:22:42.028
Maybe right around here?
Alright.

469
00:22:42.112 --> 00:22:43.738
Are we all gonna sit
in the same spot?

470
00:22:43.822 --> 00:22:45.240
Yeah. For now.
Oh. OK.

471
00:22:45.323 --> 00:22:47.158
The more sky we can see. the better.

472
00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:55.583
How about right here?

473
00:22:56.543 --> 00:22:57.919
Alrighty.

474
00:22:59.754 --> 00:23:02.215
Alright. guys. uh. crew.
do you think we can kill the lights

475
00:23:02.298 --> 00:23:04.259
so that we can. uh.
pull out the night visions?

476
00:23:04.342 --> 00:23:05.677
Go IR?

477
00:23:17.522 --> 00:23:20.233
I'm seeing something moving!

478
00:23:22.027 --> 00:23:25.989
I'm seeing something
I cannot identify.

479
00:23:26.072 --> 00:23:29.117
Is it moving in a straight line?
I don't know.

480
00:23:31.119 --> 00:23:33.413
It could be a satellite.
Oh. I see something moving.

481
00:23:33.496 --> 00:23:34.706
Yes!

482
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:36.541
What is it?

483
00:23:36.624 --> 00:23:39.794
Well. I'd say it's a satellite if it
keeps moving in a straight line.

484
00:23:39.878 --> 00:23:42.255
Straight line?
Yeah.

485
00:23:42.339 --> 00:23:44.341
It gets smaller. though.

486
00:23:44.424 --> 00:23:48.636
That's what happens when things
move away. It's kind of fading out.

487
00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.555
It's fading out.

488
00:23:50.638 --> 00:23:53.808
So what happens is they go
into the earth's shadow.

489
00:23:55.185 --> 00:23:57.771
And they can kind of look
like they just disappeared.

490
00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:00.482
Yeah. I don't know
if I believe that.

491
00:24:00.565 --> 00:24:02.025
(LAUGHS)

492
00:24:05.362 --> 00:24:07.364
Oh. what the BLEEP is that?

493
00:24:07.447 --> 00:24:09.741
I can see it with my naked eye.
No. there's one there.

494
00:24:09.824 --> 00:24:11.159
That is not a satellite.

495
00:24:13.536 --> 00:24:13.797
2
00:23:15.040 -- 00:23:17.520 align:middle line:65% position:50%
There's one there too.
Where's the other one?

496
00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:19.918
Right there on the other side of it.
they're going at each other.

497
00:24:20.001 --> 00:24:22.003
Yeah. they're going
opposite directions.

498
00:24:22.087 --> 00:24:23.838
Satellites still.
Come on!

499
00:24:23.922 --> 00:24:25.799
But you see what I'm saying?

500
00:24:25.882 --> 00:24:28.218
You're gonna see
a gazillion more satellites

501
00:24:28.301 --> 00:24:29.886
than you've ever
seen in your life.

502
00:24:29.969 --> 00:24:34.182
No. come on. man.
Dude. I gotta take these off.

503
00:24:34.265 --> 00:24:37.560
Ben. you see something moving.
I'm like "Oh. BLEEP what's that?"

504
00:24:37.644 --> 00:24:40.313
And he's like. "Well.
that looks like Satellite G-75

505
00:24:40.397 --> 00:24:42.899
"'cause what it is
is the same track..."

506
00:24:42.982 --> 00:24:45.652
Every time I think I see something.
he tells me it's not.

507
00:24:46.611 --> 00:24:48.571
So I saw something zip.
I'm like "What's that?"

508
00:24:48.655 --> 00:24:50.699
And he's like "It's just
a shooting star." I was like OK.

509
00:24:50.782 --> 00:24:54.452
Ben is. uh. he's a little bit
of a Benny...

510
00:24:54.536 --> 00:24:56.871
What is it. Debbie Downer?

511
00:24:56.955 --> 00:25:00.333
So Benny. Benny Bumout.

512
00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:03.795
I think it's time that we. uh.

513
00:25:03.878 --> 00:25:07.590
have you guys do some
sort of manifesting or something.

514
00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.928
Do. uh. do what you do best
and put out your vibes.

515
00:25:14.681 --> 00:25:18.935
Come. Come.

516
00:25:19.019 --> 00:25:22.355
You know. of course you're
getting a vibe of. like.

517
00:25:22.439 --> 00:25:24.149
wow. this is extraordinary.

518
00:25:24.232 --> 00:25:27.986
Visually. it's unreal and just
something I've never seen.

519
00:25:28.069 --> 00:25:30.822
I mean. there's so much being thrown
at me from beginning to end

520
00:25:30.905 --> 00:25:34.200
that it's. you know. it's hard
to pinpoint your feelings.

521
00:25:34.284 --> 00:25:39.164
Maybe we should try some signalling.
We can. uh. use the spotlights.

522
00:25:39.247 --> 00:25:42.917
Basically. we're going
to introduce ourselves

523
00:25:43.001 --> 00:25:45.879
and introduce our intent
of what we're here.

524
00:25:45.962 --> 00:25:48.423
and then we can all do...
Maybe start with the same signal.

525
00:25:48.506 --> 00:25:50.175
We'd approach it in the same way

526
00:25:50.258 --> 00:25:52.844
as if we were going
to a paranormally active house

527
00:25:52.927 --> 00:25:56.389
or something.
I'd say "My name is Ben Hansen."

528
00:25:57.223 --> 00:25:58.641
"My name is Jack."

529
00:25:59.351 --> 00:26:00.935
"My name's Jamie Kennedy."

530
00:26:01.019 --> 00:26:03.480
"My name's Jason Mewes."

531
00:26:03.563 --> 00:26:07.233
"And we're here to document evidence
and communicate.

532
00:26:07.317 --> 00:26:11.404
"And to establish communication.
we have lights

533
00:26:11.488 --> 00:26:15.533
"that if we shine these
into the sky. into the ground.

534
00:26:15.617 --> 00:26:17.994
"if you're able to appear somewhere

535
00:26:18.078 --> 00:26:21.623
"that we can see you or signal back.
please feel free to do so."

536
00:26:21.706 --> 00:26:23.833
Has everyone got their light?
Yup.

537
00:26:23.917 --> 00:26:25.418
Just point it straight up in the air

538
00:26:25.502 --> 00:26:30.131
and then we'll go on. off.
on. off. on. off.

539
00:26:30.215 --> 00:26:31.424
like three times.

540
00:26:31.508 --> 00:26:36.888
OK. here we go.
One. two. three.

541
00:26:36.971 --> 00:26:39.724
One...
Whoops.

542
00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:46.064
Two. Gotta cycle through
the whole thing. three.

543
00:26:47.399 --> 00:26:49.859
Now leave it off.

544
00:26:54.781 --> 00:26:57.867
Keep scanning the sky.
keep looking down the horizon.

545
00:27:04.416 --> 00:27:07.127
As you're looking over there.
let's look over this way.

546
00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:09.004
So we're signalling again. right?

547
00:27:09.087 --> 00:27:12.716
Yep. Two. three.

548
00:27:15.427 --> 00:27:20.015
Two. Three.

549
00:27:31.526 --> 00:27:33.194
Whoa!
What?

550
00:27:33.278 --> 00:27:34.612
Crazy BLEEP shooting star.

551
00:27:34.696 --> 00:27:36.322
Oh. Huh.

552
00:27:36.406 --> 00:27:38.241
That was crazy. though.

553
00:27:38.324 --> 00:27:40.201
That didn't look like
a shooting star. though.

554
00:27:40.285 --> 00:27:41.578
Where?

555
00:27:41.661 --> 00:27:44.497
It was right here. It went pshew.

556
00:27:44.581 --> 00:27:45.957
It didn't have a trail to it.

557
00:27:46.041 --> 00:27:48.168
You know shooting stars
will have a trail?

558
00:27:48.251 --> 00:27:54.382
It literally just looked like
a star just moving without a trail.

559
00:27:54.466 --> 00:27:56.634
Was it really fast or semi?

560
00:27:56.718 --> 00:27:57.886
Super fast.

561
00:27:57.969 --> 00:28:00.638
Oh. you see that light flash?
Where? Where?

562
00:28:00.722 --> 00:28:02.390
OK. This is really odd.
Where?

563
00:28:02.474 --> 00:28:04.434
Look where my flashlight is.
It's not moving.

564
00:28:06.603 --> 00:28:08.271
Holy BLEEP.

565
00:28:08.355 --> 00:28:10.023
Oh. crap. come.
come on. come on. come on.

566
00:28:10.106 --> 00:28:11.566
There it is.
There it is.

567
00:28:11.649 --> 00:28:13.526
OK. got it. I got it.
What the BLEEP is that?

568
00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:14.819
I got one. one flash.

569
00:28:16.821 --> 00:28:18.615
Oh. I see it again!

570
00:28:18.698 --> 00:28:21.201
It's not blinking
like a traditional plane.

571
00:28:21.284 --> 00:28:22.577
That's weird.

572
00:28:23.203 --> 00:28:24.913
Hold on. here comes a plane.

573
00:28:26.831 --> 00:28:29.334
OK. I got something coming.
but it's...

574
00:28:29.417 --> 00:28:30.835
That's a plane.
That's a plane we're looking at?

575
00:28:30.919 --> 00:28:32.420
Yeah. that's one plane for sure.

576
00:28:32.504 --> 00:28:34.005
But that's not what we were
just looking at.

577
00:28:34.089 --> 00:28:38.051
That's every second.
Boom. Boom. Boom.

578
00:28:38.134 --> 00:28:40.053
The other one that flashed.

579
00:28:40.136 --> 00:28:43.515
it was like flash. one.
two. three. four. five. six...

580
00:28:43.598 --> 00:28:45.725
It was quite lengthy.
Yeah. it was very lengthy.

581
00:28:45.809 --> 00:28:47.727
That was not a plane.
I don't think. bro.

582
00:28:47.811 --> 00:28:50.188
OK. I need someone
to reach for my tablet.

583
00:28:50.271 --> 00:28:52.232
Right there. Jay.

584
00:28:52.315 --> 00:28:53.608
Oh. yeah.

585
00:28:53.692 --> 00:28:55.902
I want to make sure
this is not a plane.

586
00:28:59.114 --> 00:29:00.907
So that's one going this way.
that's's going...

587
00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:04.119
There's nothing flying away from us.
No. Wow. dude.

588
00:29:04.202 --> 00:29:06.246
Oh. that's crazy.

589
00:29:07.247 --> 00:29:09.624
I feel like we should
give another flash.

590
00:29:09.708 --> 00:29:12.210
We'll do the flashlight. flash 'em.

591
00:29:12.293 --> 00:29:18.758
And then I say we start moving down
towards. uh. base camp again.

592
00:29:18.842 --> 00:29:21.219
That is a great plan.
Let's go.

593
00:29:21.302 --> 00:29:23.138
Alright.

594
00:29:24.681 --> 00:29:27.517
Who's ready?
I'm ready.

595
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.145
Three. two. one.

596
00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:34.315
Three. two. one.

597
00:29:36.651 --> 00:29:38.778
Three. two. one.

598
00:29:42.907 --> 00:29:44.784
Why don't I have a light?

599
00:29:44.868 --> 00:29:46.828
'Cause you gave it to me.
Alright.

600
00:29:46.911 --> 00:29:48.663
Here. You can have my light. Jamie.

601
00:29:48.747 --> 00:29:50.832
Well. I'm gonna do it after? And...

602
00:29:52.292 --> 00:29:55.128
(LAUGHS)
"Here's a PS!"

603
00:29:55.211 --> 00:29:56.671
(LAUGHS)
PS.

604
00:29:56.755 --> 00:30:00.216
I'm focused on one thing.
helping to spot something

605
00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.969
out of the ordinary.
supernatural. uh. and such.

606
00:30:03.053 --> 00:30:04.804
Not worried about other things

607
00:30:04.888 --> 00:30:07.474
that could be lurking around.

608
00:30:07.557 --> 00:30:09.476
animals or anything crazy
like that.

609
00:30:09.559 --> 00:30:12.062
So. uh. there's no fear
but excitement.

610
00:30:12.145 --> 00:30:13.730
It's the excitement and adrenaline

611
00:30:13.813 --> 00:30:16.566
being like.
"Wow. I think I saw something."

612
00:30:16.649 --> 00:30:19.152
Let's move up to the ridge

613
00:30:19.235 --> 00:30:21.821
and I feel like if we get up there.
then we can see more.

614
00:30:21.905 --> 00:30:24.115
Right now I can only see
this hilltop.

615
00:30:24.199 --> 00:30:25.617
I can't see past it.

616
00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:27.452
Sounds like a good plan.
Get higher. baby.

617
00:30:27.535 --> 00:30:29.579
Alright. I'll fuck with that. Jay.
I'll fuck with that.

618
00:30:29.662 --> 00:30:32.374
Alright. let's go!
Regulators. mount up!

619
00:30:32.457 --> 00:30:34.334
Oh. I don't have my chair. Shit.

620
00:30:40.173 --> 00:30:42.133
Alright. guys.
I found our spot.

621
00:30:43.134 --> 00:30:44.761
Wow.

622
00:30:47.889 --> 00:30:50.934
Wow. It looks a little flat.

623
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:54.688
I'm into this.

624
00:30:55.563 --> 00:30:57.482
Where you going. bro?

625
00:30:59.234 --> 00:31:02.028
Hey. bro. it's not cool
if you go by yourself.

626
00:31:02.112 --> 00:31:05.281
You get bit by a rattlesnake. bro.
I'm not sucking the venom out.

627
00:31:10.912 --> 00:31:13.665
Dude. this looks so cool
in the night vision.

628
00:31:13.748 --> 00:31:15.125
what he looks like.
look at him.

629
00:31:15.208 --> 00:31:18.753
One man on his journey.

630
00:31:18.837 --> 00:31:22.173
Here's the deal.
I gotta go out alone.

631
00:31:22.257 --> 00:31:24.467
I think that would be the way.

632
00:31:24.551 --> 00:31:26.720
I think that's the way to see
some of this shit.

633
00:31:26.803 --> 00:31:27.971
When it knows you're vulnerable.

634
00:31:28.054 --> 00:31:31.182
This is the Jamie Kennedy
Paranormal Experience.

635
00:31:31.266 --> 00:31:33.393
Ha ha. yeah!

636
00:31:33.476 --> 00:31:34.978
Yeah. spin-off.

637
00:31:43.069 --> 00:31:45.280
What's over here?
Where?

638
00:31:45.363 --> 00:31:47.741
It's a shack right there.

639
00:31:47.824 --> 00:31:50.035
Have you looked
through the night vision?

640
00:31:50.952 --> 00:31:52.662
I just saw something over here.

641
00:31:52.746 --> 00:31:54.122
Really?

642
00:31:54.205 --> 00:31:56.291
Where's our... No. the campground's
right there. bro.

643
00:31:56.374 --> 00:31:57.542
Campground's here.

644
00:31:57.625 --> 00:32:00.337
Holy crap. there's something
back there. dude.

645
00:32:04.841 --> 00:32:05.102
2
00:30:47.320 -- 00:30:49.960 align:middle line:65% position:50%
There was something back here.
just turned on and turned off.

646
00:32:09.054 --> 00:32:10.597
The beam...
Was it like a visible light?

647
00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:12.182
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

648
00:32:12.265 --> 00:32:14.809
It had a light looking at us
and when I went like this.

649
00:32:14.893 --> 00:32:19.064
it saw me put the pointer on it
and it turned its light off.

650
00:32:19.147 --> 00:32:22.192
I'm looking through the thermal
and I'm not seeing anyone.

651
00:32:22.275 --> 00:32:24.819
No? Whoa. dude.
That's crazy. then.

652
00:32:24.903 --> 00:32:27.113
I would see someone moving around
if there was someone out there.

653
00:32:27.197 --> 00:32:28.782
Right there's our campground.

654
00:32:28.865 --> 00:32:30.617
'cause look at our campground.
see how there's a light?

655
00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:32.535
Are you fucking serious? Right here.

656
00:32:32.619 --> 00:32:34.788
OK. I just saw another blink.
There's another blink.

657
00:32:34.871 --> 00:32:36.664
Turn your light off.
Over there? Oh. oh. oh.

658
00:32:36.748 --> 00:32:38.166
Hold on. turn your light off.
Right in that same area.

659
00:32:38.249 --> 00:32:39.751
there was a slight blink.
Yup. yup.

660
00:32:39.834 --> 00:32:42.796
It's not coming up on thermal.
whatever the fuck that is.

661
00:32:43.505 --> 00:32:48.218
It blinked and then...
Right there.

662
00:32:48.301 --> 00:32:50.136
It's. like. travelling.

663
00:32:54.516 --> 00:32:57.102
Whatever it is not giving off
any heat signature.

664
00:32:57.185 --> 00:32:59.062
so it's not someone out there.
I would see them.

665
00:32:59.771 --> 00:33:02.023
It looked like they were just
standing there watching us.

666
00:33:02.107 --> 00:33:04.526
and then when I put my pointer
towards it.

667
00:33:04.609 --> 00:33:07.278
it was like.
"Turn off the light. shoot."

668
00:33:07.362 --> 00:33:10.615
I thought it was our base camp.
That's crazy. see?

669
00:33:11.241 --> 00:33:13.785
The observers become the observed.

670
00:33:13.868 --> 00:33:16.955
I got. like. two flashes
before it disappeared.

671
00:33:18.665 --> 00:33:20.709
Dude. I don't know. this is weird.

672
00:33:21.376 --> 00:33:25.338
If it is aware of us
and it's curious about us...

673
00:33:25.422 --> 00:33:26.798
Yeah.

674
00:33:26.881 --> 00:33:28.883
..so far. it's been
at quite a distance.

675
00:33:28.967 --> 00:33:31.386
It's almost like
it's kind of circling us

676
00:33:31.469 --> 00:33:33.722
but it wouldn't have
to turn on a light

677
00:33:33.805 --> 00:33:35.682
if it didn't want to. right?
We're assuming.

678
00:33:35.765 --> 00:33:37.225
Yeah.

679
00:33:37.308 --> 00:33:39.269
It's almost like it wanted you
to see that.

680
00:33:39.352 --> 00:33:41.271
And it was some kind of light.

681
00:33:41.354 --> 00:33:43.940
some kind of...
This middle of this area

682
00:33:44.024 --> 00:33:47.235
where there's definitely no roads.
so it definitely wasn't a car.

683
00:33:47.318 --> 00:33:49.863
it wasn't a motorcycle. it was...

684
00:33:49.946 --> 00:33:52.282
And it wasn't anybody from the crew.

685
00:33:52.365 --> 00:33:55.535
Like. I can't explain that
and it was definitely something

686
00:33:55.618 --> 00:33:57.704
very. very strange.

687
00:33:57.787 --> 00:34:01.958
What. four or five witnesses?
Like. that's pretty significant.

688
00:34:02.042 --> 00:34:03.877
If someone was messing with us.

689
00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:05.670
your thermal should've picked up
on it.

690
00:34:05.754 --> 00:34:06.838
Yeah. didn't.

691
00:34:06.921 --> 00:34:09.007
And there was.
there's nobody out there

692
00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:10.467
and it looked like
it was moving faster

693
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:13.970
than a person could be running
in the dark over this terrain.

694
00:34:14.054 --> 00:34:16.222
so it was.
it was very weird.

695
00:34:16.306 --> 00:34:19.768
So I think we should. uh.
maybe call it for the night.

696
00:34:19.851 --> 00:34:21.478
Start reviewing some of the footage.

697
00:34:21.561 --> 00:34:24.356
seeing if any of the stationary
cameras picked up anything.

698
00:34:24.439 --> 00:34:25.815
Yes.

699
00:34:25.899 --> 00:34:28.693
And. uh. reconvene about tomorrow.
Sounds like a plan.

700
00:34:28.777 --> 00:34:31.571
I like it. and we can go through
all of the. uh. items we have

701
00:34:31.654 --> 00:34:36.034
and see if we want to bring
anything different. uh. tomorrow.

702
00:34:36.117 --> 00:34:38.328
Alright. Let's go!

703
00:34:40.955 --> 00:34:43.958
Uh. my first. like.
real UFO investigation.

704
00:34:44.042 --> 00:34:46.086
um. pretty interesting.

705
00:34:46.169 --> 00:34:48.254
You know. we got some results.

706
00:34:48.338 --> 00:34:51.341
I think the tactic moving forward
is to kind of keep it along the same.

707
00:34:51.424 --> 00:34:52.717
You know. we've gotta
interview witnesses.

708
00:34:52.801 --> 00:34:55.011
we gotta find great locations
to go investigate.

709
00:34:55.095 --> 00:34:57.305
and we gotta post up
and watch the skies.

710
00:35:01.643 --> 00:35:03.186
Hey. guys. check this out.

711
00:35:03.269 --> 00:35:06.856
So at the 45 second mark.
look right here.

712
00:35:08.692 --> 00:35:11.444
See this odd blip.

713
00:35:13.863 --> 00:35:15.657
See that?
Oh. wow. yeah.

714
00:35:18.785 --> 00:35:21.454
We did catch it. this is what we
were seeing down here in the valley.

715
00:35:21.538 --> 00:35:23.331
Yes. And we were concerned
that we didn't catch it.

716
00:35:23.415 --> 00:35:25.917
The fact that you reacted
at the same time...

717
00:35:26.001 --> 00:35:27.210
Yeah.

718
00:35:27.293 --> 00:35:29.087
..tells me that it wasn't
an insect right in front

719
00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:31.339
of the camera here because
it was seen down below us.

720
00:35:31.423 --> 00:35:33.550
100 percent.
and you can even see me look.

721
00:35:33.633 --> 00:35:35.593
I look. 'cause I'm like
"Oh. that's the camp."

722
00:35:35.677 --> 00:35:37.971
and I'm like.
"Wait. no. there's the camp."

723
00:35:39.973 --> 00:35:43.476
We had the night vision and we
didn't see anything around.

724
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.895
so it couldn't have been someone
driving a bicycle or anything.

725
00:35:45.979 --> 00:35:47.689
Mm-hm.
And other people saw it.

726
00:35:47.772 --> 00:35:49.107
so I wasn't seeing things.

727
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:51.234
Well. and the fact that it was
kind of flared up. you know.

728
00:35:51.317 --> 00:35:54.529
from the camera's point of view here
tells me

729
00:35:54.612 --> 00:35:56.614
it was actually pretty bright.
because it looks like it's happening

730
00:35:56.698 --> 00:35:59.909
just right there in the sage.
but it's really down in the valley.

731
00:35:59.993 --> 00:36:01.369
Yeah.
So it's pretty big.

732
00:36:01.453 --> 00:36:02.704
So look at this.

733
00:36:02.787 --> 00:36:06.332
I found this really interesting.
We saw lights that were pulsing.

734
00:36:06.416 --> 00:36:07.792
Yes.
Yep.

735
00:36:07.876 --> 00:36:10.170
So tell me when you see it flash.

736
00:36:12.881 --> 00:36:14.466
Right there.
Yep.

737
00:36:14.549 --> 00:36:17.677
OK. Now watch again nearby.
there it goes again.

738
00:36:17.761 --> 00:36:19.179
Oh!
Yep. yep.

739
00:36:19.262 --> 00:36:21.348
OK. Each time it flashes.
it's slightly moving.

740
00:36:21.431 --> 00:36:22.599
Mm-hm.

741
00:36:22.682 --> 00:36:24.559
The easiest explanation is
it's gonna be...It's a plane.

742
00:36:24.642 --> 00:36:27.395
But most anti-collision lights
on planes

743
00:36:27.479 --> 00:36:31.191
don't just do single strobe.
they'll do like a double strobe.

744
00:36:31.274 --> 00:36:34.319
You at least have...
Have to have your beacon on.

745
00:36:34.402 --> 00:36:38.323
which is normally red and that's
like a steady pulse. right?

746
00:36:38.406 --> 00:36:39.491
OK.

747
00:36:40.992 --> 00:36:45.830
So I'm gonna put it in my box
of "Ehh. interesting. interesting."

748
00:36:45.914 --> 00:36:48.583
I like it. I like it. as long
as you got a box for that.

749
00:36:48.667 --> 00:36:51.836
To me it's still exciting.
This is just the first day. so...

750
00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.129
Yeah.
So I'm really excited.

751
00:36:53.213 --> 00:36:54.589
'cause we got that on video.

752
00:36:54.673 --> 00:36:56.591
And I wish it was a little bit
clearer. but hey.

753
00:36:56.675 --> 00:36:58.468
beggars can't be choosers.

754
00:36:58.551 --> 00:37:00.804
And I know in the area
that we even see on video.

755
00:37:00.887 --> 00:37:04.224
which is great. it was
a big open field like this.

756
00:37:04.307 --> 00:37:07.894
so it wasn't a road. it didn't
happen to be a fast passing car.

757
00:37:07.977 --> 00:37:09.854
This absolutely correlates
with the activity

758
00:37:09.938 --> 00:37:13.024
that Ryan was discussing yesterday
with the strange light anomalies.

759
00:37:13.108 --> 00:37:17.445
I was actually expecting. uh. less.

760
00:37:17.529 --> 00:37:19.030
I didn't think we caught anything

761
00:37:19.114 --> 00:37:21.700
when. uh. Jay saw
that mysterious light.

762
00:37:21.783 --> 00:37:23.660
Um. so I was pleased
that we got something.

763
00:37:23.743 --> 00:37:27.664
I mean. I'm not 100 percent sure
that that is the light he saw.

764
00:37:27.747 --> 00:37:29.791
but there is some
strange flare going on.

765
00:37:29.874 --> 00:37:32.544
Was it definitively a UFO?
Can't say.

766
00:37:32.627 --> 00:37:34.254
But is it anomalous? Yup.

767
00:37:34.337 --> 00:37:37.841
Well. I think it's important
that we continue meeting people.

768
00:37:37.924 --> 00:37:40.343
hearing these eyewitness
testimonies.

769
00:37:41.052 --> 00:37:44.597
I love adventure.
Searching for things unknown

770
00:37:44.681 --> 00:37:45.932
is an adventure.

771
00:37:46.016 --> 00:37:47.809
And I hope we can avoid
the negative things

772
00:37:47.892 --> 00:37:52.939
and just enjoy the company. uh.
of Jack and Jamie and myself

773
00:37:53.023 --> 00:37:57.027
and all the people we meet and get
to hear what they have to say.

774
00:38:05.785 --> 00:38:07.829
So we just got done
reviewing some evidence.

775
00:38:07.912 --> 00:38:10.290
Um. so now it's time
to talk to locals.

776
00:38:10.373 --> 00:38:13.626
We want to canvass the basin
and get as many witness accounts

777
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:17.047
as possible to help us figure out
what our next moves are

778
00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:18.381
in this investigation.

779
00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:22.135
Why are we meeting out here?

780
00:38:22.218 --> 00:38:25.722
You're now here to show
you some areas of the oil field

781
00:38:25.805 --> 00:38:28.391
that. uh.
scare the crap out of me.

782
00:38:28.475 --> 00:38:29.976
It's 108.

783
00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:32.062
Yeah. It's 108 degrees out.

784
00:38:32.145 --> 00:38:34.189
We couldn't meet in your garage?
No.

785
00:38:34.272 --> 00:38:35.815
OK.

786
00:38:35.899 --> 00:38:37.317
You gotta live it.
(CHUCKLES)

787
00:38:39.486 --> 00:38:42.781
I've been prior
law enforcement. retired.

788
00:38:42.864 --> 00:38:44.991
uh. private investigations
after that.

789
00:38:45.075 --> 00:38:48.953
Having had a background
in anthropology and archaeology.

790
00:38:49.037 --> 00:38:51.790
I decided
to melt the two together

791
00:38:51.873 --> 00:38:56.086
and investigate things
that dealt with. uh. ancient

792
00:38:56.169 --> 00:38:58.880
uh. historical data that was lost

793
00:38:58.963 --> 00:39:02.801
and a lot of the unexplainable
that goes along with that.

794
00:39:05.804 --> 00:39:08.014
I live in East Carbon. Utah.

795
00:39:08.098 --> 00:39:11.851
and I've had rather
unusual experiences

796
00:39:11.935 --> 00:39:15.772
with. uh. non-human entities.

797
00:39:15.855 --> 00:39:17.273
OK.

798
00:39:22.278 --> 00:39:26.783
I'm a tribal member of the Uintah
and Ouray Indian reservation here.

799
00:39:26.866 --> 00:39:30.161
which encompasses over two and
a half million acres.

800
00:39:30.245 --> 00:39:32.372
I'm also part of the.
uh. Lakota nation

801
00:39:32.455 --> 00:39:34.332
from up in North
and South Dakota.

802
00:39:34.416 --> 00:39:37.794
We've always known about this.
uh. the Skinwalker Ranch area.

803
00:39:37.877 --> 00:39:41.172
Actually. it's burial grounds around
all those cliffs around it.

804
00:39:41.256 --> 00:39:44.884
so that whole area
was known as kind of.

805
00:39:44.968 --> 00:39:47.470
I wouldn't say evil.
but there was a negative force.

806
00:39:49.014 --> 00:39:51.975
First time I ever saw
a skinwalker was out here.

807
00:39:52.058 --> 00:39:53.560
A skinwalker?
Yeah.

808
00:39:53.643 --> 00:39:55.103
What did it look like?

809
00:39:55.186 --> 00:39:56.563
I backed up my truck to the well.

810
00:39:56.646 --> 00:39:58.815
I had the lights on on the truck
so you could see.

811
00:39:58.898 --> 00:40:01.776
And as I looked through
the mirror behind my truck.

812
00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:04.946
this thing was underneath my truck.

813
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:07.073
so I sort of
peeked through the mirror.

814
00:40:07.157 --> 00:40:09.951
This thing stands up
from underneath the truck.

815
00:40:10.035 --> 00:40:13.246
puts its hand on there.
and looks right at the mirror.

816
00:40:13.329 --> 00:40:17.375
Well. the truck sits about
12 feet up from the trailer.

817
00:40:17.459 --> 00:40:19.586
It's probably two feet under that.

818
00:40:19.669 --> 00:40:22.005
So when it stood up.
it stood straight up

819
00:40:22.088 --> 00:40:24.591
and it looked like a fox. his face.

820
00:40:24.674 --> 00:40:27.344
But its eyes were brilliant blue.

821
00:40:27.427 --> 00:40:30.138
Wow. The way you did that
was. like...

822
00:40:30.889 --> 00:40:33.058
Yeah. It stood up.
Manny.

823
00:40:33.141 --> 00:40:34.726
Yeah.
Like. it's...

824
00:40:34.809 --> 00:40:36.394
Well. how do you know
it's a skinwalker?

825
00:40:36.478 --> 00:40:39.481
Another way to tell.
it's a wolf-looking thing.

826
00:40:39.564 --> 00:40:41.858
A wolf?
Wolf. fox. coyote.

827
00:40:41.941 --> 00:40:45.153
It had the face
of a coyote. almost.

828
00:40:45.236 --> 00:40:46.654
Like Wile E. Coyote?

829
00:40:46.738 --> 00:40:47.822
Yeah. like Wile E. Coyote.

830
00:40:52.243 --> 00:40:56.539
For the last several years.
I'd been focusing on the petroglyphs

831
00:40:56.623 --> 00:40:59.167
and pictographs
that are in this area.

832
00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:01.169
Those really do fascinate me

833
00:41:01.252 --> 00:41:03.755
because it's just so amazing
that people. like.

834
00:41:03.838 --> 00:41:07.217
sat and drew stories out on the wall

835
00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:09.386
and they are there
for so long.

836
00:41:09.469 --> 00:41:12.597
What's crazy to hear is it looks
like you're watching a horror movie.

837
00:41:12.681 --> 00:41:14.474
Yeah.
Or science fiction movie.

838
00:41:14.557 --> 00:41:17.519
And there's aerial phenomena
that you can see.

839
00:41:17.602 --> 00:41:20.355
In Nine Mile Canyon.
you have what look to be UFOs

840
00:41:20.438 --> 00:41:24.901
with aliens and it's showing uplift.
it's showing stuff coming out of it.

841
00:41:24.984 --> 00:41:29.948
There is a spot where there are
26 different figures coming out.

842
00:41:30.031 --> 00:41:33.034
five species out of what looks
to be a portal.

843
00:41:35.203 --> 00:41:35.464
2
00:39:56.200 -- 00:39:58.600 align:middle line:68% position:50%
When was the last time you had.

844
00:41:41.126 --> 00:41:43.628
uh. an encounter
with a non-human entity?

845
00:41:43.712 --> 00:41:47.549
This orb has been following me
ever since

846
00:41:47.632 --> 00:41:50.969
my first encounter
with this entity.

847
00:41:51.052 --> 00:41:54.806
In 2008. I started having
these visitations

848
00:41:54.889 --> 00:41:59.644
from a non-human
humanoid-type being.

849
00:42:05.525 --> 00:42:07.277
Could you describe
what it looked like?

850
00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:11.614
Yeah. He was dark brown.
He had a large cranium

851
00:42:11.698 --> 00:42:17.328
with three. uh. ridges
that had one main ridge

852
00:42:17.412 --> 00:42:20.373
in the centre of the skull

853
00:42:20.457 --> 00:42:22.751
and then one smaller one
on each side.

854
00:42:22.834 --> 00:42:27.213
Uh. he had large black...
They weren't the typical oval eyes.

855
00:42:27.297 --> 00:42:30.091
These were more round.

856
00:42:30.175 --> 00:42:35.096
But they were like four or five
times bigger than a human.

857
00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:39.184
He had a very narrow. petite chin.

858
00:42:39.267 --> 00:42:42.103
He was about five and a half
foot tall.

859
00:42:42.187 --> 00:42:45.482
He had a very small mouth.
he never talked.

860
00:42:45.565 --> 00:42:49.152
The only time he had talked.
it was done telepathically.

861
00:42:49.235 --> 00:42:50.445
Wow.

862
00:42:52.864 --> 00:42:55.658
We were always told
to stay away from this river.

863
00:42:55.742 --> 00:42:57.077
stay away from these cliffs.

864
00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:59.245
You know. stay away
from all this area.

865
00:42:59.329 --> 00:43:01.039
And especially at night. you know.

866
00:43:03.041 --> 00:43:06.127
And in regards to skinwalkers.
I'll just say I have

867
00:43:06.211 --> 00:43:11.925
no beef with them. just so they know
I have no beef with them.

868
00:43:12.008 --> 00:43:16.304
I feed 'em. I take 'em offerings.
I joke. I tease.

869
00:43:16.388 --> 00:43:19.099
They like it
when you're happy. but any...

870
00:43:19.182 --> 00:43:20.809
I'd say that too.
But anyhow...

871
00:43:20.892 --> 00:43:22.811
You should put that
out there. right?

872
00:43:22.894 --> 00:43:24.145
Yeah. Yeah. Yes. absolutely.

873
00:43:25.146 --> 00:43:27.148
What was another experience you had?

874
00:43:27.232 --> 00:43:28.900
If you look back behind you.

875
00:43:28.983 --> 00:43:30.527
Skinwalker Ranch
is right back there.

876
00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:33.571
I had three UFOs come out
of that area right there.

877
00:43:33.655 --> 00:43:35.907
three glowing
amber lights come up.

878
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:40.245
and then they all sort of moved
to the right. basically going east.

879
00:43:40.328 --> 00:43:43.540
It flew probably
a good 30. 40 yards out.

880
00:43:43.623 --> 00:43:46.251
It pulled up. went next
to each other like this.

881
00:43:46.334 --> 00:43:48.545
and then spun this way. whsst.

882
00:43:48.628 --> 00:43:51.881
This and then just...
They disappeared.

883
00:43:51.965 --> 00:43:54.217
they just turned
into dots and poof. gone.

884
00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:56.136
And then. hyperspeeded?

885
00:43:56.219 --> 00:43:59.347
Yeah. I don't know if hyperspeed.
but it disappeared.

886
00:43:59.431 --> 00:44:02.017
Wow. Really?
Yeah.

887
00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:04.144
How come I never get
to see this shit?

888
00:44:07.105 --> 00:44:09.441
We're at. uh.
Bottle Hollow Reservoir.

889
00:44:09.524 --> 00:44:13.445
and the history behind this
reservoir is just intense.

890
00:44:13.528 --> 00:44:17.949
This place was filled in by the
Army Corps of Engineers in 1970.

891
00:44:18.033 --> 00:44:20.076
but before that. it was a canyon

892
00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:22.996
that had supposed
strange occurrences.

893
00:44:23.079 --> 00:44:27.876
Um. UFOs had been seen.
I'll show you a photo.

894
00:44:27.959 --> 00:44:31.254
This is before the water
was. uh. filled in

895
00:44:31.338 --> 00:44:33.631
to the canyon
and turned into a reservoir.

896
00:44:33.715 --> 00:44:36.384
What you're looking at.
there is a location

897
00:44:36.468 --> 00:44:41.222
that would be right over here.
right where we're at.

898
00:44:41.306 --> 00:44:42.807
OK. Mm-hm.

899
00:44:42.891 --> 00:44:44.809
And it looks like
there was a huge runway.

900
00:44:44.893 --> 00:44:47.145
Yeah. yeah. yeah.
In the ground. And I...

901
00:44:47.228 --> 00:44:49.064
I see that right there on top. yeah.

902
00:44:49.147 --> 00:44:51.858
Yeah. it looks to have been
a huge runway

903
00:44:51.941 --> 00:44:55.195
leading right into the canyon wall
just on the other side.

904
00:44:55.278 --> 00:44:58.365
The roads have been created. uh.

905
00:44:58.448 --> 00:45:02.911
by the Ute tribe in what looks
to be. uh. geoglyphs.

906
00:45:02.994 --> 00:45:06.998
It's these huge circles that are in
these patterns that can. guess what?

907
00:45:07.082 --> 00:45:09.459
Only be seen from the air.
Wow.

908
00:45:09.542 --> 00:45:11.503
And it's massive.
And guess where it's at?

909
00:45:11.586 --> 00:45:14.964
It's right on the other side
of where this runway used to be.

910
00:45:16.883 --> 00:45:18.176
What have you seen?

911
00:45:18.259 --> 00:45:20.303
You seem like you've got
a wealth of alien knowledge?

912
00:45:20.387 --> 00:45:22.305
I've seen quite
a bit here in the basin.

913
00:45:22.389 --> 00:45:26.685
One that comes to mind
that was unforgettable for me

914
00:45:26.768 --> 00:45:32.816
was I have this feeling
to go for a drive one night.

915
00:45:32.899 --> 00:45:35.276
end up in. uh.
Wolf Creek Pass.

916
00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:38.363
And I notice this light
up on the ridge.

917
00:45:38.446 --> 00:45:42.826
It started to move along
this ridge line.

918
00:45:42.909 --> 00:45:45.412
Did this for. like. 15 minutes.
it was pretty slow.

919
00:45:45.495 --> 00:45:48.998
And then it zipped back
to its original spot

920
00:45:49.082 --> 00:45:52.419
and then just went shoop.
like to nothing.

921
00:45:52.502 --> 00:45:55.005
It was almost like it powered down.

922
00:45:55.088 --> 00:45:57.298
And then in that same spot.

923
00:45:57.382 --> 00:46:01.803
it started to. like.
build back up energy or something.

924
00:46:01.886 --> 00:46:04.848
That's when I got the one picture.
Oh. OK.

925
00:46:04.931 --> 00:46:06.766
Ooh.

926
00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:09.185
I got it when
it was powering back up.

927
00:46:09.269 --> 00:46:11.062
but you can see the shape of it.

928
00:46:16.526 --> 00:46:20.655
The last time I had
an encounter with him.

929
00:46:20.739 --> 00:46:26.286
he came and after a while.
what seemed like a couple minutes.

930
00:46:26.369 --> 00:46:30.165
everything turned to fuzzy white
and I passed out.

931
00:46:30.248 --> 00:46:35.086
And I came to. I was lying face down
on a. uh. what looked like

932
00:46:35.170 --> 00:46:38.256
a stainless steel table

933
00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:41.301
and the room was full
of these entities.

934
00:46:41.384 --> 00:46:46.431
And there was also humans in there
wearing white lab coats.

935
00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:53.146
Do you think that the drilling
has anything to do with it?

936
00:46:53.229 --> 00:46:59.486
They say once you dig in the earth.
the earth digs into you.

937
00:46:59.569 --> 00:47:01.488
Well. could be.

938
00:47:01.571 --> 00:47:04.824
Could be a way of trying
to get people to stop drilling.

939
00:47:04.908 --> 00:47:06.951
But I'm not for sure on that.

940
00:47:07.035 --> 00:47:11.122
'Cause it is land that was
somebody else's before ours.

941
00:47:11.206 --> 00:47:13.958
Do you feel that it's.
like. a Native American

942
00:47:14.042 --> 00:47:19.089
spiritual thing happening.
or do you think it's otherworldly?

943
00:47:19.172 --> 00:47:22.008
I think it's more otherworldly.

944
00:47:25.804 --> 00:47:28.723
I purchased several
different magnetometers.

945
00:47:28.807 --> 00:47:32.519
which reads the magnetic level
of the earth's centre

946
00:47:32.602 --> 00:47:35.939
at a specific location
on the land.

947
00:47:36.022 --> 00:47:39.567
I went through this basin
and took hundreds of data points.

948
00:47:39.651 --> 00:47:41.277
which took weeks.

949
00:47:41.361 --> 00:47:45.365
I came across three magnetic
atypical readings.

950
00:47:45.448 --> 00:47:48.159
which were so phenomenal.

951
00:47:48.243 --> 00:47:52.414
These three magnetic readings
were down

952
00:47:52.497 --> 00:47:55.625
to a negative 14 microtesla

953
00:47:55.709 --> 00:47:58.586
all the way up
to about a 50 microtesla.

954
00:47:58.670 --> 00:48:03.383
So we're getting these reads
that are going from a negative 14

955
00:48:03.466 --> 00:48:05.802
all the way up to about 50.
that should never happen.

956
00:48:05.885 --> 00:48:07.345
Yeah. yeah.

957
00:48:07.429 --> 00:48:11.349
Unless we're coming up against
an atypical magnetic structure or...

958
00:48:11.433 --> 00:48:13.351
Where you know. or maybe
some places you do know

959
00:48:13.435 --> 00:48:14.602
and you're like.
"Oh. look. here's something.

960
00:48:14.686 --> 00:48:16.688
"there's something built under."

961
00:48:16.771 --> 00:48:18.273
Like if someone has a bomb shelter.

962
00:48:18.356 --> 00:48:19.691
you might get a reading
like that. right?

963
00:48:19.774 --> 00:48:22.360
You would absolutely.
because there's less of that space

964
00:48:22.444 --> 00:48:26.406
in between the centre of the earth
to where we are on the top.

965
00:48:26.489 --> 00:48:27.991
OK.

966
00:48:28.074 --> 00:48:29.743
But to get this constant flux...
Yeah.

967
00:48:29.826 --> 00:48:32.078
..it should never happen.
no matter where we are.

968
00:48:32.162 --> 00:48:35.206
Unless something massive
is underground.

969
00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:40.378
like some type of device or a craft
or some type of vehicle

970
00:48:40.462 --> 00:48:43.757
or. uh. an underground building
or structure

971
00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:45.425
that we're just not aware of.

972
00:48:45.508 --> 00:48:48.136
And all three of these readings

973
00:48:48.219 --> 00:48:52.432
were in a diagonal. perfectly
straight line at 8.34 degrees.

974
00:48:52.515 --> 00:48:55.393
and it runs right through
the centre of Skinwalker Ranch.

975
00:48:57.812 --> 00:49:00.690
All these experiences.
have they stuck with you?

976
00:49:00.774 --> 00:49:04.110
They stick to me to the point
that I don't like being out here

977
00:49:04.194 --> 00:49:06.196
alone at night
in the oil field anymore.

978
00:49:06.279 --> 00:49:08.031
So what do you do?
Working days now.

979
00:49:08.114 --> 00:49:09.824
so I don't have to
come out here at night.

980
00:49:09.908 --> 00:49:11.868
Definitely don't get
creeped out anymore.

981
00:49:11.951 --> 00:49:14.287
'cause as you see.
you can see for miles.

982
00:49:14.371 --> 00:49:16.915
Nothing's gonna creep you out
here during the day.

983
00:49:16.998 --> 00:49:18.917
So that's why you wanted
to meet during the day?

984
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.502
Yeah. It's a lot easier.

985
00:49:20.585 --> 00:49:24.464
You come out here. you don't feel
that weird presence at night.

986
00:49:24.547 --> 00:49:26.549
Really?
Yeah.

987
00:49:26.633 --> 00:49:28.635
I think it's kind of peaceful.
I think.

988
00:49:28.718 --> 00:49:30.762
It is peaceful
until you get out there.

989
00:49:30.845 --> 00:49:33.556
Especially if you had experience.
you get out there

990
00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:35.809
and you're like "OK. I know
there's stuff out here."

991
00:49:35.892 --> 00:49:37.977
so you're on edge.

992
00:49:38.687 --> 00:49:40.855
So this is real. this has
got you freaked out. huh?

993
00:49:40.939 --> 00:49:43.566
Yeah. Creeps me out. Till you
lived through it. you don't know.

994
00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:46.611
There's a lot more stuff
going on instead of just here.

995
00:49:46.695 --> 00:49:49.406
Out towards Fantasy Canyon
and out towards the east.

996
00:49:49.489 --> 00:49:51.491
out those wells towards Colorado.

997
00:49:51.574 --> 00:49:53.952
there's a lot of stuff
still out more that way.

998
00:49:54.035 --> 00:49:59.332
Fantasy...Fantasy Canyon.

999
00:49:59.416 --> 00:50:00.625
Yep.

1000
00:50:00.709 --> 00:50:04.337
So after talking to these guys.
I feel that. you know.

1001
00:50:04.421 --> 00:50:07.716
they definitely shed
some light on things.

1002
00:50:07.799 --> 00:50:11.052
It's all just more evidence
of what we're doing.

1003
00:50:11.136 --> 00:50:15.640
more accounts of situations.
more proof. more things that are.

1004
00:50:15.724 --> 00:50:18.893
you know. it just adds value
to what. uh. we're here.

1005
00:50:18.977 --> 00:50:22.856
It just brings the excitement
to what we're doing here.

1006
00:50:22.939 --> 00:50:27.444
Manny said the place to go
was Fantasy Canyon.

1007
00:50:27.527 --> 00:50:31.656
And I. you know. with all respect.
I haven't seen anything yet.

1008
00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:37.912
So. gotta go to Fantasy Canyon
and see what is up.

1009
00:50:41.583 --> 00:50:41.843
2
00:48:38.840 -- 00:48:40.600 align:middle line:90% position:50%
Are we doing this?

1010
00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:47.088
Alright. gents. Fantasy Canyon.

1011
00:50:47.172 --> 00:50:48.465
Who interviewed the dude
that was like.

1012
00:50:48.548 --> 00:50:50.967
"Fantasy Canyon is the shit"?
I did.

1013
00:50:51.051 --> 00:50:52.218
Yeah. yeah.

1014
00:50:52.302 --> 00:50:54.262
So he said that's where he sees
the most crazy stuff.

1015
00:50:54.346 --> 00:50:56.848
What kind of stuff did he say
he witnessed out there?

1016
00:50:56.931 --> 00:51:00.769
Uh. skinwalker was
in his truck. Uh...

1017
00:51:00.852 --> 00:51:03.438
In his truck?
Yeah. behind the chains.

1018
00:51:03.521 --> 00:51:04.814
What?!

1019
00:51:04.898 --> 00:51:06.608
Uh. a little bit of fox
with blue eyes.

1020
00:51:06.691 --> 00:51:09.694
This sounds like this is gonna be
the spot. right here.

1021
00:51:09.778 --> 00:51:13.448
Did he feel like people should be
fearful of their own safety?

1022
00:51:13.531 --> 00:51:17.243
Yeah. he said he was very
scared and he said

1023
00:51:17.327 --> 00:51:22.082
he saw things that just looked
very. very. very frightening to him.

1024
00:51:23.583 --> 00:51:26.252
And always alone. Always alone.

1025
00:51:26.336 --> 00:51:30.548
So that's the thing is.
we're gonna have to split up.

1026
00:51:30.632 --> 00:51:31.883
But what if we don't split up.

1027
00:51:31.966 --> 00:51:33.968
'cause I'm afraid to split up.
so what if I. like.

1028
00:51:34.052 --> 00:51:36.054
get on your shoulders
and you wear. like. a trenchcoat?

1029
00:51:36.137 --> 00:51:37.430
Mm-hm.

1030
00:51:37.514 --> 00:51:39.599
And we look like
a really tall person.

1031
00:51:39.683 --> 00:51:41.559
All three of us could do it.
Done.

1032
00:51:41.643 --> 00:51:45.522
I did think it was very ominous.
what Jeremy was saying about

1033
00:51:45.605 --> 00:51:49.109
if you're looking for something.
it will be looking back at you.

1034
00:51:49.192 --> 00:51:55.657
Remember. throughout history.
the observer becomes the observed.

1035
00:51:56.241 --> 00:51:58.576
You're not frightened. James?

1036
00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:01.371
Dude. it's eerie.
It can be eerie.

1037
00:52:02.288 --> 00:52:04.082
If we came face
to face with something.

1038
00:52:04.165 --> 00:52:05.875
we'd be getting observed.

1039
00:52:05.959 --> 00:52:08.586
hopefully only observed
and not bum-rushed.

1040
00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:10.046
Mm-hm.

1041
00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:12.966
We'll try to. uh. be very quiet.

1042
00:52:13.049 --> 00:52:15.677
Yeah. I think silence.
silence is gonna be golden in this.

1043
00:52:16.803 --> 00:52:19.764
Yeah. Ben is not with us tonight.
where it's just us.

1044
00:52:19.848 --> 00:52:23.852
We're gonna just be out there
with a childlike sense of wonder.

1045
00:52:23.935 --> 00:52:26.062
You got the stuff.
We got all the stuff.

1046
00:52:26.146 --> 00:52:27.856
You got
the night goggles. right?

1047
00:52:27.939 --> 00:52:29.357
Yep.
Yeah. you got the goodies.

1048
00:52:29.441 --> 00:52:30.692
Yep.
The training wheels are off

1049
00:52:30.775 --> 00:52:32.360
and we're ready to go.
I'm in.

1050
00:52:32.444 --> 00:52:36.406
We have to do one of these. bro.
One. two. three. skinwalker.

1051
00:52:36.489 --> 00:52:39.868
Yo. Fantasy Canyon.
here we come. my friends.

1052
00:52:39.951 --> 00:52:42.746
Ooh. I love how
we're all talking about. like.

1053
00:52:42.829 --> 00:52:45.665
the craziness
and it just gets dark and gloomy.

1054
00:52:49.794 --> 00:52:52.797
Already I feel like just.
just travelling here...

1055
00:52:52.881 --> 00:52:55.050
Feels weird. Different. right?
Different.

1056
00:52:55.133 --> 00:52:57.135
Fucking wild.
Whoa!

1057
00:52:57.218 --> 00:52:59.387
That lightning!
Yeah. look at this.

1058
00:52:59.471 --> 00:53:01.431
Look at these rocks. man.

1059
00:53:01.514 --> 00:53:04.100
This is wild.
Ahh!

1060
00:53:04.184 --> 00:53:06.019
Look at that.
Ahh!

1061
00:53:06.102 --> 00:53:07.979
This is. like. dinosaurs.

1062
00:53:08.063 --> 00:53:10.732
Whoa!
Shizzle.

1063
00:53:11.733 --> 00:53:14.736
That was fucking nuts!
Yeah. dude.

1064
00:53:14.819 --> 00:53:16.196
It's lightning.

1065
00:53:16.279 --> 00:53:19.491
The fact that as soon as we started
our drive to Fantasy Canyon.

1066
00:53:19.574 --> 00:53:22.827
the weather went from. like.
100 degrees and clear

1067
00:53:22.911 --> 00:53:25.705
to all of a sudden thunderstorms
is concerning.

1068
00:53:25.789 --> 00:53:28.458
It's like something doesn't
want us out here tonight.

1069
00:53:28.541 --> 00:53:31.836
I just thought I saw something.
like. running alongside of us.

1070
00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:33.338
Shut the fuck up.

1071
00:53:33.421 --> 00:53:35.507
I swear. I'm not kidding.
Are you serious?

1072
00:53:35.590 --> 00:53:37.258
I'm looking. I'm looking. though.

1073
00:53:37.342 --> 00:53:38.927
Like up on the ridge?

1074
00:53:39.010 --> 00:53:40.929
Right where...
It's where that barrel is.

1075
00:53:41.012 --> 00:53:42.472
Like. that deep.

1076
00:53:42.555 --> 00:53:44.599
But I swear when I looked over.
I saw something.

1077
00:53:44.683 --> 00:53:46.726
like. hauling ass with us.

1078
00:53:48.061 --> 00:53:49.813
Here we go. look. Fantasy Canyon.

1079
00:53:49.896 --> 00:53:53.692
Ain't no cell service
out here. boys. Shit.

1080
00:53:57.779 --> 00:54:00.156
This is like the type of shit

1081
00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:02.617
where shit will pop out
from a rock. I'm serious.

1082
00:54:02.701 --> 00:54:04.536
Alright. boys.

1083
00:54:04.619 --> 00:54:06.830
We're here. boys. let's go.

1084
00:54:09.207 --> 00:54:10.709
Ooh. this is weird.

1085
00:54:10.792 --> 00:54:13.294
(SIGHS)
Wow.

1086
00:54:16.798 --> 00:54:18.425
Alright. so here's the plan.

1087
00:54:18.508 --> 00:54:19.968
We've got all sorts of gear.

1088
00:54:20.051 --> 00:54:22.137
everything from ghost gear

1089
00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:25.932
to. like. high-level
night vision and thermal.

1090
00:54:26.016 --> 00:54:29.728
Alright. let me see here. Radar.
Yeah.

1091
00:54:29.811 --> 00:54:32.355
You see something moving.
we blast it.

1092
00:54:32.439 --> 00:54:34.482
Ba-dew.
(LAUGHS)

1093
00:54:34.566 --> 00:54:36.234
And we'll see if we can get it.

1094
00:54:36.317 --> 00:54:38.069
You're bringing the machete?

1095
00:54:38.153 --> 00:54:40.363
Dude. I'm bringing this
because if we come face to face

1096
00:54:40.447 --> 00:54:43.450
with one of these things.
respect. but...

1097
00:54:43.533 --> 00:54:46.286
Fair enough.
This was such a great...

1098
00:54:46.369 --> 00:54:47.704
Ooh. that's good.
Yeah.

1099
00:54:47.787 --> 00:54:50.373
I mean. you can hear
a bee fart with this.

1100
00:54:50.457 --> 00:54:51.875
One of your farts.

1101
00:54:51.958 --> 00:54:53.960
Oh. you don't need this.
Bro.

1102
00:54:54.044 --> 00:54:56.296
We got these.
I'm gonna take these. thank you.

1103
00:54:56.379 --> 00:54:59.257
I think this is what
you're looking for. young man.

1104
00:54:59.341 --> 00:55:01.176
Oh. hell yeah.

1105
00:55:01.259 --> 00:55:02.927
Is this what you're looking for?

1106
00:55:03.011 --> 00:55:05.430
Those are what you're looking for.
These are what you need.

1107
00:55:05.513 --> 00:55:07.098
The golden goose.

1108
00:55:07.182 --> 00:55:09.517
Alrighty. Got that.
I got my flashlight.

1109
00:55:09.601 --> 00:55:12.520
Yeah. I got my light.
my laser. my night vision.

1110
00:55:16.441 --> 00:55:20.403
The vibe in itself is just.
you know. you get a feeling.

1111
00:55:20.487 --> 00:55:22.739
like a different feeling
of something...

1112
00:55:22.822 --> 00:55:25.658
Something's watching you
or something's around.

1113
00:55:25.742 --> 00:55:27.827
Like I don't know. but I just.
it feels that way.

1114
00:55:27.911 --> 00:55:30.497
you start to feel like.
it's just unreal.

1115
00:55:31.748 --> 00:55:33.458
Is this where we're doing
the offering?

1116
00:55:33.541 --> 00:55:35.460
Put that right in the circle.
Right here in the circle.

1117
00:55:35.543 --> 00:55:38.296
I don't know if we just. like. leave
a can and leave a pack of smokes.

1118
00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:40.256
Let's get the machete. bro.

1119
00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:42.092
Try to chop the can right in half.

1120
00:55:42.175 --> 00:55:43.760
You really want to do that?

1121
00:55:43.843 --> 00:55:46.429
Yeah. We gotta open it for 'em.

1122
00:55:47.639 --> 00:55:49.224
Are you kidding me?

1123
00:55:49.307 --> 00:55:51.518
No. I'm not kidding.
Give it a skippity-bop-bop.

1124
00:55:51.601 --> 00:55:54.145
What if they don't have
the technology to open up a can?

1125
00:55:54.229 --> 00:55:55.438
I think that's stupid.

1126
00:55:55.522 --> 00:55:57.524
Alright. you gonna give it a chop?
But you can do it.

1127
00:55:57.607 --> 00:55:58.942
You want me to chop it?

1128
00:55:59.025 --> 00:56:00.652
Have at it. friend.

1129
00:56:00.735 --> 00:56:05.407
Alright. This is for y'all
and all who might like it.

1130
00:56:08.743 --> 00:56:10.829
Should I go for it? You ready?
Do it.

1131
00:56:12.205 --> 00:56:15.125
Oh...
Look at that. Look at that.

1132
00:56:15.208 --> 00:56:17.043
Like a glove.

1133
00:56:17.127 --> 00:56:19.963
Yeah. I know you...
It's open now. bro.

1134
00:56:20.046 --> 00:56:24.009
"I know you're from another galaxy.
let me give you some dented corn."

1135
00:56:24.092 --> 00:56:26.678
OK. there we go. Corny love.

1136
00:56:26.761 --> 00:56:28.763
There we go!
There we go. exactly. now.

1137
00:56:28.847 --> 00:56:31.516
That knife is sharp as hell. bro.

1138
00:56:31.599 --> 00:56:33.935
There is thy corn.

1139
00:56:34.894 --> 00:56:38.398
Here's some tobacco. here's some
corn. We mean no disrespect.

1140
00:56:38.481 --> 00:56:40.275
No disrespect.

1141
00:56:40.358 --> 00:56:43.278
I don't know. Jay throws a pack
of Marlboro reds in there

1142
00:56:43.361 --> 00:56:46.781
and fucking corn from Costco?

1143
00:56:46.865 --> 00:56:50.910
It's like Jesus Christ.
and then he. like. opens it.

1144
00:56:50.994 --> 00:56:55.373
like fucking janky style
and cuts it in half.

1145
00:56:55.457 --> 00:56:56.499
I think that was a little...

1146
00:56:56.583 --> 00:56:58.752
That was. like.
disrespectful to the spirits.

1147
00:56:58.835 --> 00:57:02.172
Um. so hopefully
they don't get pissed off.

1148
00:57:03.048 --> 00:57:04.632
Let's go.

1149
00:57:13.683 --> 00:57:16.603
This is some of
the craziest rocks I've ever seen.

1150
00:57:16.686 --> 00:57:18.980
whoa. it is slippery up here. boys.

1151
00:57:19.898 --> 00:57:25.695
Ho-ho. shit.
This is insane.

1152
00:57:26.196 --> 00:57:28.573
This is one of the craziest
looking places I've ever seen.

1153
00:57:30.492 --> 00:57:32.243
I feel like the energy
here's a different energy

1154
00:57:32.327 --> 00:57:34.245
from where we were.
Yeah.

1155
00:57:35.288 --> 00:57:37.290
We should trek up there.
OK.

1156
00:57:44.923 --> 00:57:45.183
2
00:55:29.600 -- 00:55:31.720 align:middle line:90% position:50%
We should cruise in.
we should find a good vantage point.

1157
00:57:54.099 --> 00:57:55.558
Yeah.
On. like. a hilltop

1158
00:57:55.642 --> 00:57:57.143
and we should just hunker down.

1159
00:58:01.898 --> 00:58:07.028
Ooh. alright.
I think this is the good spot.

1160
00:58:12.826 --> 00:58:14.786
Alright. here we go.

1161
00:58:14.869 --> 00:58:16.996
Oh. Yeah. baby.

1162
00:58:20.458 --> 00:58:22.794
Alright. guys. let's do.
like. a bit of an intention.

1163
00:58:24.087 --> 00:58:27.590
We left you guys. uh. an offering.

1164
00:58:30.301 --> 00:58:32.262
Let's just sit here for a minute.

1165
00:58:48.153 --> 00:58:50.447
If you look that way. Jack...
Yeah.

1166
00:58:50.530 --> 00:58:53.742
..there's something blinking
on the horizon.

1167
00:58:54.993 --> 00:58:57.245
Oh. yeah.
You see that?

1168
00:58:57.328 --> 00:58:58.580
Yeah.

1169
00:58:58.663 --> 00:59:00.457
There's two things. What is that?

1170
00:59:03.501 --> 00:59:05.253
It's not a plane.
This one isn't.

1171
00:59:05.337 --> 00:59:07.380
That's blinking big time. right?

1172
00:59:07.464 --> 00:59:09.632
The one underneath.
but it's not moving.

1173
00:59:09.716 --> 00:59:13.178
It's all over the place.
It's erratic. It's erratic.

1174
00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:17.640
That's super erratic.
I'm gonna track it for a little bit.

1175
00:59:17.724 --> 00:59:20.727
Yeah. dude. it's moving.
but barely. Like...

1176
00:59:22.103 --> 00:59:23.313
Yeah.
Look at the...

1177
00:59:23.396 --> 00:59:25.106
Look at on both sides.
those aren't moving.

1178
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:26.608
No.
You think they're stars?

1179
00:59:26.691 --> 00:59:28.026
I don't know.

1180
00:59:29.110 --> 00:59:31.863
Wait. the other one is starting
to go up in the air. dude.

1181
00:59:32.739 --> 00:59:35.617
So is that the bottom moving
right now? It's going up.

1182
00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:39.829
That...it's weird.
The blinking's gone.

1183
00:59:41.373 --> 00:59:43.875
The blinking has gone.

1184
00:59:54.886 --> 00:59:58.765
I'd rather see a craft
right now than a creature.

1185
00:59:58.848 --> 01:00:00.225
Mm.
To be real with you.

1186
01:00:01.810 --> 01:00:03.770
You know?
Yeah.

1187
01:00:03.853 --> 01:00:07.482
I feel like this would be. like.
where creatures would. like...

1188
01:00:07.565 --> 01:00:09.526
Hide out.
Yeah. right?

1189
01:00:21.246 --> 01:00:22.288
Whoa.

1190
01:00:23.373 --> 01:00:26.251
What is that?
Do you see the little black?

1191
01:00:26.334 --> 01:00:27.585
Yeah.

1192
01:00:27.669 --> 01:00:31.006
OK. Now watch.
It seems like it didn't move.

1193
01:00:32.132 --> 01:00:35.385
But after Jay puts his light there.
there's nothing there.

1194
01:00:35.468 --> 01:00:37.178
Right. I'm gonna put
the light up. watch out.

1195
01:00:37.262 --> 01:00:38.763
OK. three. two. one. go.

1196
01:00:38.847 --> 01:00:40.849
Huh. Now turn it off.

1197
01:00:43.518 --> 01:00:45.103
It's so weird!

1198
01:00:45.186 --> 01:00:46.855
Yeah. right?
What the fuck?

1199
01:00:46.938 --> 01:00:48.648
Right?
That's so weird.

1200
01:00:48.732 --> 01:00:51.735
It's something black there.
Not moving.

1201
01:00:51.818 --> 01:00:57.991
It could be a crevasse
and that way. we are a shadow.

1202
01:00:58.074 --> 01:01:00.201
Yeah. It's so weird.

1203
01:01:00.285 --> 01:01:01.661
I know.

1204
01:01:02.454 --> 01:01:03.913
See it there?
Yeah.

1205
01:01:03.997 --> 01:01:05.498
And now it's gone.

1206
01:01:05.582 --> 01:01:08.752
It's like when you observe it.
it's gone.

1207
01:01:08.835 --> 01:01:12.672
Through the night vision.
when we looked across these canyons.

1208
01:01:12.756 --> 01:01:14.758
it looked like someone
was stood there.

1209
01:01:14.841 --> 01:01:16.926
and then when you shine the
flashlight. there was nothing there.

1210
01:01:17.010 --> 01:01:18.636
I don't know. it's really odd.

1211
01:01:22.849 --> 01:01:23.110
2
00:58:56.240 -- 00:58:58.640 align:middle line:65% position:50%
Alright. Let's. uh.
let's go off on our own.

1212
01:01:30.523 --> 01:01:34.527
So the three of are gonna separate
and go our kind of own ways

1213
01:01:34.611 --> 01:01:36.488
and do some bit
of exploring around.

1214
01:01:36.571 --> 01:01:39.866
Apparently skinwalkers only tend
to show up when you're alone.

1215
01:01:39.949 --> 01:01:43.995
I'm gonna post up.
I'm gonna try to listen.

1216
01:01:48.208 --> 01:01:51.086
(WHIMPERS)

1217
01:01:58.385 --> 01:01:59.636
Brr.

1218
01:01:59.719 --> 01:02:02.972
Oh. shit.
Like. what makes something

1219
01:02:03.056 --> 01:02:06.559
out of straw that's in
this kind of weather?

1220
01:02:06.643 --> 01:02:09.521
Dude. there's something else
that's been in here.

1221
01:02:10.814 --> 01:02:12.607
(SCREAMS)

1222
01:02:12.691 --> 01:02:15.902
Oh. shit. dude.
Oh. shit. dude.

1223
01:02:16.653 --> 01:02:20.115
There could be hundreds in here.
we better get out of here.

1224
01:02:23.993 --> 01:02:25.787
I never seen a real bat.

1225
01:02:25.870 --> 01:02:30.583
Or what if it's
a shapeshifter. bro? Straight up.

1226
01:02:31.793 --> 01:02:35.171
There's a feeling
that it's not just animals.

1227
01:02:35.255 --> 01:02:36.923
It could be many things.

1228
01:02:39.384 --> 01:02:42.053
Now whose tracks are these?

1229
01:02:52.689 --> 01:02:54.607
Now look at this clay.

1230
01:02:54.691 --> 01:02:57.485
That's grey and that's red.

1231
01:02:57.569 --> 01:03:04.325
Like something was burned
or it bled out. Is this blood?

1232
01:03:04.409 --> 01:03:10.123
There's streaks of red all over
these mountains. Fascinating.

1233
01:03:15.754 --> 01:03:21.426
Oh. shit. This looks like
some kind of graveyard

1234
01:03:21.509 --> 01:03:23.720
from back in the day.

1235
01:03:23.803 --> 01:03:25.764
Look at that one.

1236
01:03:25.847 --> 01:03:29.184
That's like Transylvania
or some shit.

1237
01:03:29.267 --> 01:03:31.102
What if this is more
than aliens?

1238
01:03:33.229 --> 01:03:35.023
What if this is vampires?

1239
01:03:43.615 --> 01:03:48.286
Oh. shit. Shit.
Look at this.

1240
01:03:48.370 --> 01:03:51.498
It goes deep in there.
That hole keeps going.

1241
01:03:53.083 --> 01:03:57.212
Damn. that's like a total
hiding spot. This is intense.

1242
01:03:58.463 --> 01:04:01.174
There's something out here.
I don't know what.

1243
01:04:03.635 --> 01:04:07.472
Oh. fuck.
Something just freaked me out.

1244
01:04:07.555 --> 01:04:08.640
someone's walking over there.

1245
01:04:08.723 --> 01:04:11.226
Who's over there? Look.

1246
01:04:13.812 --> 01:04:15.522
You see?

1247
01:04:17.691 --> 01:04:19.442
Who is that?

1248
01:04:25.907 --> 01:04:28.410
Must be one of us. 'cause they're
walking towards the cars.

1249
01:04:32.288 --> 01:04:34.958
No. he just fucking turned.

1250
01:04:35.875 --> 01:04:37.627
Now they're running.

1251
01:04:38.461 --> 01:04:40.130
Whoever the fuck they're...

1252
01:04:40.213 --> 01:04:43.550
Who is that?
Now he's running full belt.

1253
01:04:44.467 --> 01:04:46.219
You can see them. right?

1254
01:04:49.723 --> 01:04:53.810
Holy fuck. dude.
They just walked over the ridge.

1255
01:04:55.311 --> 01:04:57.188
Who the BLEEP is that?

1256
01:04:57.981 --> 01:05:01.192
I literally just watched someone
come from behind the hill

1257
01:05:01.276 --> 01:05:03.403
and I thought
it was one of our crew.

1258
01:05:03.486 --> 01:05:05.739
And it's like oh.
he's going towards the cars.

1259
01:05:05.822 --> 01:05:08.033
Must be one of us. 'cause they're
walking towards the cars.

1260
01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:16.249
No. he just fucking turned.
Now they're running.

1261
01:05:17.083 --> 01:05:19.502
And he just fucking kept running

1262
01:05:19.586 --> 01:05:22.630
and they're. like. somewhere
in this region here.

1263
01:05:24.299 --> 01:05:28.553
That was fucking weird.
Who the fuck was that?!

1264
01:05:31.639 --> 01:05:33.683
We need to go find
whoever the fuck that is.

1265
01:05:36.436 --> 01:05:38.521
Did I just see a fucking skinwalker?

1266
01:05:40.315 --> 01:05:42.650
OK. it was on the other side
of this.

1267
01:05:42.734 --> 01:05:45.320
They were in this.
like. gully right here.

1268
01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:49.699
It stopped here.

1269
01:05:49.783 --> 01:05:52.952
And then it took off this way
and started running.

1270
01:05:53.036 --> 01:05:55.372
And you see this
little berm right here?

1271
01:05:55.455 --> 01:06:02.754
It went over this. whoever it was.
Here we go. look. look.

1272
01:06:02.837 --> 01:06:07.676
Footprints. Look. see?

1273
01:06:08.927 --> 01:06:10.970
I told you. they were running.

1274
01:06:11.054 --> 01:06:17.435
OK. another one here. here. Here.

1275
01:06:19.562 --> 01:06:21.314
Who the fuck was this?

1276
01:06:22.107 --> 01:06:25.235
Dude. I think we saw
a fucking skinwalker. bro.

1277
01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:27.581
2
01:03:45.960 -- 01:03:48.320 align:middle line:65% position:50%
Can you radio and tell everyone
to come back to base camp?

1278
01:06:35.203 --> 01:06:36.913
He says...

1279
01:06:38.373 --> 01:06:40.709
We're coming!

1280
01:06:40.792 --> 01:06:42.460
Jamie.
Yeah.

1281
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:45.630
You guys aren't gonna
fucking believe me

1282
01:06:45.714 --> 01:06:47.799
when I tell you this shit.

1283
01:06:47.882 --> 01:06:50.677
Dude. I swear to God.
I fucking saw a skinwalker.

1284
01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:52.095
No!
And we...

1285
01:06:52.178 --> 01:06:53.638
And we got it on fucking tape. dude.
No!

1286
01:06:53.722 --> 01:06:55.974
Dude. Dude. I'm like...

1287
01:06:56.057 --> 01:06:58.977
I saw some crazy shit. but...

1288
01:07:04.107 --> 01:07:06.568
Dude. there's fucking footprints.

1289
01:07:07.402 --> 01:07:08.987
Put it on something.

1290
01:07:09.070 --> 01:07:11.531
Dude. our corn and tobacco offerings
actually worked!

1291
01:07:11.614 --> 01:07:13.366
Jay. watch where you're stepping.
because there's tracks here.

1292
01:07:13.450 --> 01:07:17.120
Dude. I fucking shit do not.
I think I fucking saw a skinwalker.

1293
01:07:17.203 --> 01:07:18.830
Wait. what?

1294
01:07:18.913 --> 01:07:20.999
I'm up here on the ridge.
I'm looking through this.

1295
01:07:21.082 --> 01:07:22.876
I see someone come
marching around this bend.

1296
01:07:22.959 --> 01:07:24.544
you see how
the hills curves down here?

1297
01:07:24.627 --> 01:07:26.421
Yeah. yeah. yeah.
And there's this gully.

1298
01:07:26.504 --> 01:07:28.256
I see someone...
But dude. I'm talking.

1299
01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:31.176
like. doing this shit.
like fucking marching.

1300
01:07:31.259 --> 01:07:33.386
And I'm like.
"Who the fuck is that?"

1301
01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:35.305
And I thought "Oh. is it maybe.
I don't know.

1302
01:07:35.388 --> 01:07:38.475
"is it one of the producers coming
back to get a battery or whatever?"

1303
01:07:38.558 --> 01:07:42.604
He starts walking and I see
he stops 'cause he sees the cars.

1304
01:07:42.687 --> 01:07:44.439
Yeah.

1305
01:07:44.522 --> 01:07:45.899
And there's no head torch.

1306
01:07:45.982 --> 01:07:47.734
And you know how fucking dark
it is right now?

1307
01:07:47.817 --> 01:07:49.235
Yeah.

1308
01:07:49.319 --> 01:07:50.820
He pivots and starts running.

1309
01:07:50.904 --> 01:07:53.573
Look at these footprints
right here. dude.

1310
01:07:53.656 --> 01:07:55.200
Is it a fucking hiker?

1311
01:07:55.283 --> 01:07:56.951
Dude. he starts fucking running.

1312
01:07:57.035 --> 01:07:59.120
Yeah. yeah. yeah. I can see.
Look here.

1313
01:07:59.204 --> 01:08:01.456
This isn't a big foot.
this is like a Size 7 foot.

1314
01:08:01.539 --> 01:08:03.166
Yeah.

1315
01:08:03.249 --> 01:08:04.709
OK. well. let's follow it.

1316
01:08:04.793 --> 01:08:07.128
I did and it ends. Look.

1317
01:08:07.212 --> 01:08:09.047
Look how light they are too.
some of them.

1318
01:08:09.130 --> 01:08:11.049
He comes belting through here.

1319
01:08:11.132 --> 01:08:13.593
But dude. where did he go?!

1320
01:08:16.930 --> 01:08:19.849
Is he going in. like. circles
right here and disappear?

1321
01:08:23.103 --> 01:08:25.397
And he comes through here. Jay.
Wow.

1322
01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:27.774
And he comes down right here.
right where you're walking.

1323
01:08:27.857 --> 01:08:29.234
Yeah.

1324
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:32.112
I don't see more footprints.

1325
01:08:32.195 --> 01:08:34.656
Here. I'll show you where...
Here's a footprint here.

1326
01:08:34.739 --> 01:08:36.449
So this is my foot.

1327
01:08:36.533 --> 01:08:39.536
But I. dude. I got here
five minutes after.

1328
01:08:39.619 --> 01:08:41.329
Yeah.

1329
01:08:41.413 --> 01:08:44.082
And I'm fucking scanning everywhere
and I can't see anyone.

1330
01:08:45.125 --> 01:08:47.043
No. it's empty. it's empty.
They may have gone

1331
01:08:47.127 --> 01:08:48.545
to this oil thing over here.

1332
01:08:48.628 --> 01:08:50.213
We got him on tape. by the way.

1333
01:08:50.296 --> 01:08:51.673
I want to see that.

1334
01:08:51.756 --> 01:08:53.091
We have to play that back.

1335
01:08:53.675 --> 01:08:56.052
It must be one of us 'cause
they're walking towards the cars.

1336
01:09:00.348 --> 01:09:04.686
No. he just fucking turned.
Now they're running.

1337
01:09:05.812 --> 01:09:08.189
Well. guys. listen. we gotta
get back and review this.

1338
01:09:08.273 --> 01:09:11.317
I mean. I've been looking
for this for a long time now.

1339
01:09:11.401 --> 01:09:14.279
I'm guessing we probably spooked it.

1340
01:09:14.362 --> 01:09:17.032
The observers become the observed.

1341
01:09:17.115 --> 01:09:18.992
We're gonna play it back
and you're gonna see.

1342
01:09:19.075 --> 01:09:20.827
You're going to see.

1343
01:09:20.910 --> 01:09:22.370
Wow.

1344
01:09:22.454 --> 01:09:25.749
If this evidence
is something unexplainable.

1345
01:09:25.832 --> 01:09:28.209
this is. like. the crown jewel.

1346
01:09:28.293 --> 01:09:30.003
Unbelievable.

1347
01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:52.942
So last night. we captured
some pretty legit evidence.

1348
01:09:53.026 --> 01:09:55.737
I'm very excited to share it
with Jay and Jamie.

1349
01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:58.907
Apparently they found some
stuff too. we kind of split up

1350
01:09:58.990 --> 01:10:03.453
all the stuff and. you know.
reviewed amongst ourselves.

1351
01:10:03.536 --> 01:10:05.747
But yeah. we got some good stuff.

1352
01:10:14.964 --> 01:10:17.217
Alright.

1353
01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:19.469
Alright. alright. alright.
Wow.

1354
01:10:29.062 --> 01:10:30.980
Alright. my friend.

1355
01:10:31.064 --> 01:10:34.526
I'm excited because I know
you got something to show

1356
01:10:34.609 --> 01:10:36.736
and I know we got
something to show.

1357
01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:38.113
Oh. we do?

1358
01:10:38.196 --> 01:10:41.616
So. uh. Jamie and I
last night. uh. went over.

1359
01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:44.869
through some footage from the
stationary cameras we had placed.

1360
01:10:44.953 --> 01:10:48.123
I feel we got something a little odd

1361
01:10:48.206 --> 01:10:51.001
and you really have
to look right here. OK?

1362
01:10:51.084 --> 01:10:54.254
So you see this shadowy figure.
uh. thing right there.

1363
01:10:54.337 --> 01:10:56.089
Yeah.
Right now it looks like

1364
01:10:56.172 --> 01:10:58.717
a shadowy maybe
piece of rock or something.

1365
01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:02.137
But if you stare
right at that shadow...

1366
01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:06.016
Stare at it.
Shadow.

1367
01:11:13.356 --> 01:11:15.108
Huh. it. like. fades away.

1368
01:11:15.191 --> 01:11:17.068
Yeah. It just goes away.

1369
01:11:17.152 --> 01:11:18.903
But it was. like. standing there.
standing there.

1370
01:11:18.987 --> 01:11:20.405
And then there's a light.

1371
01:11:20.488 --> 01:11:22.699
And then all of a sudden. some...
Almost like it saw someone coming.

1372
01:11:22.782 --> 01:11:24.409
it said...
Yeah.

1373
01:11:24.492 --> 01:11:26.161
Holy shit.

1374
01:11:26.244 --> 01:11:28.580
That was a. like. it looks
like a silhouette.

1375
01:11:28.663 --> 01:11:30.123
Yep.
Right?

1376
01:11:30.206 --> 01:11:32.000
Yeah. even a little head.
you can even see it right there.

1377
01:11:32.083 --> 01:11:34.085
Yeah. and then it looks like it
moves there and then vanishes.

1378
01:11:35.045 --> 01:11:36.588
Whoa.

1379
01:11:36.671 --> 01:11:39.549
So no one was in this area
and it's way up there. so.

1380
01:11:40.717 --> 01:11:46.014
That's so weird.
What do you think that is?

1381
01:11:46.097 --> 01:11:49.726
Do you think that.
that is potentially a spirit?

1382
01:11:49.809 --> 01:11:52.103
Do you think that's an alien?
Do you think it's cryptid?

1383
01:11:52.187 --> 01:11:53.480
What do you think that is?

1384
01:11:53.563 --> 01:11:55.148
I don't. I don't even want
to try to figure out

1385
01:11:55.231 --> 01:11:58.026
what it might be except
for something awesome.

1386
01:11:58.109 --> 01:12:01.321
Because any of those things
you mentioned would be awesome.

1387
01:12:01.404 --> 01:12:04.032
but it's...I feel like it.
it is something.

1388
01:12:04.115 --> 01:12:05.950
So again. I don't want to speculate

1389
01:12:06.034 --> 01:12:11.081
'cause I feel like if it was
an alien. an alien has some kind of.

1390
01:12:11.164 --> 01:12:14.834
uh. luminescence glow
or some kind of. something sexy.

1391
01:12:14.918 --> 01:12:16.753
In my brain.
OK.

1392
01:12:16.836 --> 01:12:18.838
You know? Skinwalker. I feel
like. would move different.

1393
01:12:18.922 --> 01:12:20.298
Mm-hm.
You know?

1394
01:12:20.382 --> 01:12:23.510
I feel like this is almost. yeah.
more of a shaman spirit.

1395
01:12:23.593 --> 01:12:26.179
like he just sort of was like...
(BUZZING)

1396
01:12:26.262 --> 01:12:27.597
Like hovering.

1397
01:12:27.681 --> 01:12:30.475
And yeah. just sort of fiddles.
fizzles away.

1398
01:12:30.558 --> 01:12:31.851
OK.

1399
01:12:31.935 --> 01:12:33.436
That looks like a person.

1400
01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:35.897
It looks like a person stood there
with his arms down by his side

1401
01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:37.774
and just kind of like.
checking shit out.

1402
01:12:37.857 --> 01:12:39.025
Was creeping. yeah.

1403
01:12:39.109 --> 01:12:41.277
Remember we saw the black figure?
Yeah.

1404
01:12:41.361 --> 01:12:43.363
And then when we put light on it.
it wasn't there?

1405
01:12:44.572 --> 01:12:46.783
That's a kind of
a version of that. yeah?

1406
01:12:46.866 --> 01:12:48.576
Yeah. last night.
when we were back there

1407
01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:50.078
looking over and over about it.
I agree.

1408
01:12:50.161 --> 01:12:53.248
It's definitely something
that's not there when it's there.

1409
01:12:58.003 --> 01:13:00.338
Alright. guys.
Are you ready to see?

1410
01:13:00.422 --> 01:13:03.925
I'm ready to see the creme
de la creme of the crop.

1411
01:13:04.009 --> 01:13:06.553
I mean. that's not bad.
what we found. That is not bad.

1412
01:13:06.636 --> 01:13:08.888
I think it's good. yeah.
And that is a solid find.

1413
01:13:08.972 --> 01:13:10.140
Yeah.

1414
01:13:10.223 --> 01:13:12.767
Alright. gents. Brace yourselves.

1415
01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:15.280
2
01:10:17.520 -- 01:10:20.640 align:middle line:90% position:50%
Brace yourselves. OK.

1416
01:13:27.157 --> 01:13:29.701
Whoa. whoa. whoa! I see him!

1417
01:13:29.784 --> 01:13:31.244
Oh. shit.

1418
01:13:31.327 --> 01:13:33.788
What the fuck!
Oh. shit!

1419
01:13:33.872 --> 01:13:35.915
Look at how fucking fast
he's moving too.

1420
01:13:35.999 --> 01:13:37.542
Ohh. shit!

1421
01:13:37.625 --> 01:13:39.627
No head torch. nothing.

1422
01:13:45.592 --> 01:13:47.218
Look. and now he's going over.

1423
01:13:47.302 --> 01:13:49.721
Wait. why. he...
Go back. go back.

1424
01:13:49.804 --> 01:13:52.015
Go back. you bastich.

1425
01:13:53.725 --> 01:13:55.518
I see him right. right there.

1426
01:13:57.896 --> 01:14:01.107
Look how fast he's moving. dude.
nobody moves that fast.

1427
01:14:01.191 --> 01:14:04.486
You're right.
he totally saw the cars

1428
01:14:04.569 --> 01:14:06.696
and went this way and went...
Yeah. Yeah.

1429
01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:08.782
I thought he just went a beeline.
No.

1430
01:14:08.865 --> 01:14:11.368
He. like. is beelining it. and then
he sees and the he's like "Whoop!"

1431
01:14:11.451 --> 01:14:13.495
And then over that pass.

1432
01:14:13.578 --> 01:14:15.372
No. but the dude literally
was like...

1433
01:14:15.455 --> 01:14:16.706
Yeah. but our crew wasn't...

1434
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:18.750
Oh. shit. a minivan. And then...

1435
01:14:18.833 --> 01:14:21.252
That's why I'm saying.
he wouldn't have left.

1436
01:14:21.336 --> 01:14:23.296
What the fuck?
Skinwalker. dude.

1437
01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:27.217
Dude. that's so bizarre.
That's an entity with no...

1438
01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:29.469
Now..
..stuff on. No lights.

1439
01:14:29.552 --> 01:14:31.388
That guy walking is pretty crazy.

1440
01:14:32.722 --> 01:14:35.308
Did it look. like. webbed
or winged or anything like that?

1441
01:14:35.392 --> 01:14:40.105
No.
But 1:45 in the morning.

1442
01:14:40.188 --> 01:14:44.859
disappears like.
there's definitely smoke.

1443
01:14:44.943 --> 01:14:46.319
There's a lot of smoke.

1444
01:14:46.403 --> 01:14:48.988
I haven't seen fire yet
but a lot of smoke.

1445
01:14:49.072 --> 01:14:50.990
We should pop back over there first.
Yeah.

1446
01:14:51.074 --> 01:14:52.992
And see if we can follow
where his tracks went.

1447
01:14:53.076 --> 01:14:54.786
Yeah. Let's do that.

1448
01:14:54.869 --> 01:14:56.705
And then I think we should start
going back to where he came from.

1449
01:14:56.788 --> 01:14:59.541
So now that the sun's up.
I want to recheck the area

1450
01:14:59.624 --> 01:15:02.669
that we saw this figure
walking through.

1451
01:15:02.752 --> 01:15:05.714
Hopefully we can get a better idea
of if it is or isn't a skinwalker.

1452
01:15:08.466 --> 01:15:10.260
Have you ever had
anything like that?

1453
01:15:10.343 --> 01:15:12.971
I've never captured
anything like that.

1454
01:15:13.054 --> 01:15:15.515
You've never captured an entity?
Not like that.

1455
01:15:15.598 --> 01:15:17.976
You're welcome.
(LAUGHS)

1456
01:15:18.059 --> 01:15:22.188
OK. so he kind of gets to here
and then he beelines it up.

1457
01:15:22.272 --> 01:15:25.358
So we know. remember. we found
his prints here last night.

1458
01:15:25.442 --> 01:15:26.860
Yeah.

1459
01:15:26.943 --> 01:15:30.488
But it rained some more. So...

1460
01:15:30.572 --> 01:15:32.323
Walk in each other's prints.

1461
01:15:32.407 --> 01:15:34.993
But yeah. we also gotta fan out

1462
01:15:35.076 --> 01:15:36.911
and see if we can see
where he came up.

1463
01:15:38.288 --> 01:15:40.749
Was this it? Yeah. this was it.

1464
01:15:41.624 --> 01:15:43.335
Now look. there's tracks down here.

1465
01:15:44.169 --> 01:15:45.754
Yeah. this is where we came.

1466
01:15:45.837 --> 01:15:48.214
So we were all walking
around here last night.

1467
01:15:51.843 --> 01:15:53.470
There is footprints here.

1468
01:15:58.933 --> 01:16:02.562
I think he would've gone.
continued this way on here.

1469
01:16:06.232 --> 01:16:07.859
What are these?

1470
01:16:07.942 --> 01:16:09.194
There's prints here.

1471
01:16:09.277 --> 01:16:11.029
A print here.
A print there.

1472
01:16:11.112 --> 01:16:13.573
He came through here.
Yeah. Yeah.

1473
01:16:13.656 --> 01:16:15.492
He came this way.
Yeah.

1474
01:16:15.575 --> 01:16:17.160
Whatever it is.

1475
01:16:17.243 --> 01:16:18.870
That's a big print.

1476
01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:22.040
Jamie. he came this way.

1477
01:16:22.123 --> 01:16:23.583
How do you know?

1478
01:16:23.667 --> 01:16:26.586
'Cause I'm seeing.
I'm seeing. like. footprints.

1479
01:16:26.670 --> 01:16:28.672
Here. look here.

1480
01:16:28.755 --> 01:16:34.386
Boom. Here. footprint. Here. here.

1481
01:16:34.469 --> 01:16:36.221
He came through here.

1482
01:16:43.311 --> 01:16:44.896
I want to do our test. I want to...

1483
01:16:44.979 --> 01:16:46.856
I want to get someone to run.
Yeah.

1484
01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:48.858
Let's see what it looks like.
see how fast we can go.

1485
01:16:55.949 --> 01:17:01.162
OK. I was right here.
Now. Anthony. can you hear me?

1486
01:17:02.414 --> 01:17:05.792
OK. I need you to head in.
into the canyon more.

1487
01:17:12.632 --> 01:17:14.384
Keep going.

1488
01:17:20.473 --> 01:17:22.183
Right there.

1489
01:17:22.267 --> 01:17:23.685
OK. hold on.

1490
01:17:23.768 --> 01:17:25.478
This is where you first saw him?

1491
01:17:25.562 --> 01:17:28.773
I saw him come from right
where Anthony is.

1492
01:17:29.733 --> 01:17:33.403
Alright. think Bigfoot
style power walk.

1493
01:17:33.486 --> 01:17:36.072
So I timed the video
and it takes that figure

1494
01:17:36.156 --> 01:17:38.366
10 seconds to cover this distance.

1495
01:17:39.284 --> 01:17:41.244
Alright. Start now.

1496
01:17:41.327 --> 01:17:42.912
Now!

1497
01:17:51.588 --> 01:17:53.715
In my head...
That's 10.

1498
01:17:53.798 --> 01:17:58.053
Yeah. I have 10 too. yup.
And boom. stop.

1499
01:17:58.136 --> 01:17:59.471
15 seconds.

1500
01:17:59.554 --> 01:18:01.890
So 15. 16 seconds almost.

1501
01:18:01.973 --> 01:18:03.600
Five seconds.

1502
01:18:03.683 --> 01:18:05.560
Yeah. I mean. the other guy
was hauling butt. dude.

1503
01:18:05.643 --> 01:18:07.020
Whatever. whoever.
whatever that was.

1504
01:18:07.103 --> 01:18:09.856
it was hauling almost...
Pretty quick.

1505
01:18:09.939 --> 01:18:11.024
Yeah.

1506
01:18:11.107 --> 01:18:12.817
I mean. if he was a lot taller.
'Cause he's moving pretty fast.

1507
01:18:12.901 --> 01:18:15.403
Yeah. but look. Let's. let's see
if we can sync this up.

1508
01:18:18.156 --> 01:18:19.574
OK.

1509
01:18:29.542 --> 01:18:31.419
He's definitely not running.

1510
01:18:31.503 --> 01:18:36.299
I think for me. I would love
to show this to Ryan

1511
01:18:36.383 --> 01:18:38.259
and see if he's ever seen
anything like this.

1512
01:18:38.343 --> 01:18:39.761
I know he has seen skinwalkers.

1513
01:18:39.844 --> 01:18:43.056
I would. I would love
to show it to him.

1514
01:18:43.139 --> 01:18:44.766
like. "Hey. is this anything
you've seen?"

1515
01:18:44.849 --> 01:18:46.017
Yeah.

1516
01:18:46.101 --> 01:18:48.687
"Is it common to see random people
roaming around Fantasy Canyon

1517
01:18:48.770 --> 01:18:49.979
"at 1:30
in the morning?"

1518
01:18:50.063 --> 01:18:52.232
No. yeah. yeah.
And moving that speed.

1519
01:18:52.315 --> 01:18:53.900
There. there's no sense...

1520
01:18:53.983 --> 01:18:56.486
He was like. trying his hardest
to move that fast.

1521
01:18:56.569 --> 01:18:57.654
Yeah.

1522
01:18:57.737 --> 01:18:59.948
Alright. let's head back.
Ryan's gonna meet us pretty soon

1523
01:19:00.031 --> 01:19:02.117
and I want to show the footage
to him and get his opinion.

1524
01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:03.743
Yeah.

1525
01:19:07.455 --> 01:19:07.716
2
01:16:01.200 -- 01:16:03.160 align:middle line:90% position:50%
Here he is.
There he is.

1526
01:19:18.133 --> 01:19:20.510
Look at that. you could see
that van from a mile away.

1527
01:19:20.593 --> 01:19:22.429
(WHISTLES)

1528
01:19:23.304 --> 01:19:25.849
Spacewolf. Ryan Burns.

1529
01:19:25.932 --> 01:19:28.101
Here comes Spacewolf.
What's up. dude?

1530
01:19:28.184 --> 01:19:30.103
How's it going. guys?
Good to see you.

1531
01:19:30.186 --> 01:19:31.646
The most well-dressed man
in the basin.

1532
01:19:31.730 --> 01:19:34.232
Really. that's a great vibe. bro.
Thanks. man.

1533
01:19:34.315 --> 01:19:35.483
I love it.

1534
01:19:35.567 --> 01:19:37.235
We got some stuff.
Oh. I'm excited.

1535
01:19:37.318 --> 01:19:38.778
Let's start with Night 1

1536
01:19:38.862 --> 01:19:41.448
when we were out
at McCoy Flats with Ben.

1537
01:19:41.531 --> 01:19:43.158
We were just getting started

1538
01:19:43.241 --> 01:19:45.577
and we saw something
flashing in the sky.

1539
01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:47.746
Oh. You see that light flash?

1540
01:19:47.829 --> 01:19:49.039
Where? Where?

1541
01:19:49.122 --> 01:19:50.749
This is really odd.
Where?

1542
01:19:50.832 --> 01:19:52.375
Look where my flashlight is.
It's not moving.

1543
01:19:54.753 --> 01:19:56.421
Holy shit.
You got it?

1544
01:19:56.504 --> 01:19:58.548
What the BLEEP is that?
I got one flash.

1545
01:20:00.425 --> 01:20:02.218
Oh. I see it again!

1546
01:20:02.302 --> 01:20:05.513
It looked like a satellite
but it wasn't moving.

1547
01:20:05.597 --> 01:20:07.682
and it was just pulsating
and then it stopped.

1548
01:20:07.766 --> 01:20:10.769
Later. we saw another light
moving across the flats.

1549
01:20:12.437 --> 01:20:14.898
Holy crap. there's something
back there. dude.

1550
01:20:14.981 --> 01:20:17.442
It's not coming up on thermal.
whatever the fuck that is.

1551
01:20:19.652 --> 01:20:22.280
Right there. It's. like. travelling.

1552
01:20:26.159 --> 01:20:27.994
Holy cow.

1553
01:20:29.788 --> 01:20:32.207
Now let's get into
our second investigation.

1554
01:20:32.290 --> 01:20:37.754
One piece in particular. I think
you'll. uh. greatly appreciate.

1555
01:20:37.837 --> 01:20:42.217
I was up at this rock.
like. kind of pile right there.

1556
01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:46.096
And I look and into this.
like. washed-out. dried riverbed.

1557
01:20:46.179 --> 01:20:48.765
I see someone just walking.

1558
01:20:48.848 --> 01:20:50.433
Yeah.
No headlight. nothing.

1559
01:20:50.517 --> 01:20:53.311
And just booking it.
and I'm like "Who is that?"

1560
01:20:55.980 --> 01:20:58.733
Must be one of us. 'cause they're
walking towards the cars.

1561
01:21:02.654 --> 01:21:07.409
No. he just fucking turned.
Now they're running.

1562
01:21:08.743 --> 01:21:10.495
Whoever the fuck that...
Who is that?

1563
01:21:11.079 --> 01:21:13.790
I could make out enough detail
in the thermal.

1564
01:21:13.873 --> 01:21:15.875
the guy was kind of
like a head walker.

1565
01:21:15.959 --> 01:21:17.877
like his head was kind
of hunched. hunched forward.

1566
01:21:17.961 --> 01:21:21.548
And he was really swinging his arms
and he was booking it.

1567
01:21:21.631 --> 01:21:23.299
Yeah.
He gets to about probably

1568
01:21:23.383 --> 01:21:25.385
30 yards from those poles.

1569
01:21:25.468 --> 01:21:27.721
and he looks up and we had
all our cars lined up here.

1570
01:21:27.804 --> 01:21:30.140
And he looks and I see him stop

1571
01:21:30.223 --> 01:21:33.893
and he pivots and runs
full speed over the hill.

1572
01:21:33.977 --> 01:21:38.815
He kept running. And they're. like.
somewhere in this region here.

1573
01:21:39.899 --> 01:21:44.988
That was fucking weird.
Who the fuck was that?!

1574
01:21:46.072 --> 01:21:47.615
I'll just show you on here.

1575
01:21:47.699 --> 01:21:51.077
OK. Watch where my laser pointer is.

1576
01:21:51.161 --> 01:21:52.912
Oh. totally.

1577
01:22:00.545 --> 01:22:02.589
Yeah. he's booking.

1578
01:22:06.801 --> 01:22:08.887
We lost him over the ridge
at this point.

1579
01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:14.476
It was covering ground pretty fast.

1580
01:22:14.559 --> 01:22:16.978
Yes. It covered what...
We just did an experiment.

1581
01:22:17.062 --> 01:22:19.397
One of our guys just tried
to cover the same distance

1582
01:22:19.481 --> 01:22:21.608
at. like. a full power stride.

1583
01:22:21.691 --> 01:22:23.068
Wow. Yeah.

1584
01:22:23.151 --> 01:22:24.277
And it took him 15 seconds.

1585
01:22:24.361 --> 01:22:26.196
In the video. he covers
the same distance in 10.

1586
01:22:26.279 --> 01:22:27.447
Yeah.

1587
01:22:27.530 --> 01:22:29.407
And the gentleman that did
the test for us. like.

1588
01:22:29.491 --> 01:22:32.118
runs every day. so he's not even
like someone that's out of shape.

1589
01:22:32.202 --> 01:22:35.372
He was going full blast and he
did it in. like 15 to 20 seconds.

1590
01:22:35.455 --> 01:22:37.457
This is not the easiest terrain.
No.

1591
01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:39.167
And the moon.
there was no moon last night

1592
01:22:39.250 --> 01:22:41.169
because the clouds were so dense.
That's right.

1593
01:22:41.252 --> 01:22:43.880
And it was pitch black out here.
1:45 in the morning.

1594
01:22:45.173 --> 01:22:46.758
It was raining out.
Yep.

1595
01:22:46.841 --> 01:22:48.760
There was no reason
for anyone to be out.

1596
01:22:48.843 --> 01:22:50.428
Oh. it was raining too?
It was raining.

1597
01:22:50.512 --> 01:22:52.013
And that. we found his tracks.

1598
01:22:52.097 --> 01:22:54.849
They start actually all the way
over by one of the oil pumps.

1599
01:22:54.933 --> 01:22:56.309
Yeah.

1600
01:22:56.393 --> 01:22:58.353
I got...here. I got photos.
actually. I can show you.

1601
01:22:58.436 --> 01:23:00.855
Of some in the mud. Um...
They look like a little shoe.

1602
01:23:00.939 --> 01:23:02.941
Yeah. they do look like small feet.

1603
01:23:03.024 --> 01:23:05.819
Oh. yeah. Which is weird.

1604
01:23:05.902 --> 01:23:07.654
Oh. wow.

1605
01:23:07.737 --> 01:23:09.781
We took it all the way.
the tracks. near the oil.

1606
01:23:09.864 --> 01:23:11.241
And then they just stopped.

1607
01:23:11.324 --> 01:23:12.742
And there was no car they came up.

1608
01:23:12.826 --> 01:23:17.205
Unless a helicopter dropped him off.
we don't know how he started there.

1609
01:23:17.288 --> 01:23:18.707
Here. you want to look.
check again?

1610
01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:20.750
Yeah. I totally do.

1611
01:23:20.834 --> 01:23:23.336
Last night I was buzzing 'cause I'm
like "Hang on a second here."

1612
01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:25.338
Yeah. you guys have
some pretty good stuff.

1613
01:23:25.422 --> 01:23:27.173
You think so?
Yeah.

1614
01:23:27.257 --> 01:23:29.384
I can't stop watching this.

1615
01:23:29.467 --> 01:23:30.927
Dude. keep watching it.

1616
01:23:31.011 --> 01:23:34.514
Since you see this.
have you seen anything like this

1617
01:23:34.597 --> 01:23:36.725
in your findings
or heard of something like this?

1618
01:23:36.808 --> 01:23:39.310
Well. it goes right along
the normal way

1619
01:23:39.394 --> 01:23:42.230
they act and react to people.

1620
01:23:42.313 --> 01:23:44.649
It. it seems to be
watching you at first.

1621
01:23:44.733 --> 01:23:46.026
Mm-hm.

1622
01:23:46.109 --> 01:23:50.822
And then you became aware of it
and it tried to evade.

1623
01:23:50.905 --> 01:23:53.742
They're usually in the shadows
watching people.

1624
01:23:53.825 --> 01:23:55.035
Yeah.

1625
01:23:56.578 --> 01:23:59.456
I think this is just phenomenal.

1626
01:23:59.539 --> 01:24:00.665
Yeah.

1627
01:24:00.749 --> 01:24:03.626
I had an expectation to see some
lights moving around the sky. maybe.

1628
01:24:03.710 --> 01:24:05.045
Yeah.

1629
01:24:05.128 --> 01:24:08.506
I was not expecting to capture
something like this.

1630
01:24:08.590 --> 01:24:11.384
That's. that's just not
your average nightwalker.

1631
01:24:11.468 --> 01:24:12.802
No.
(LAUGHS)

1632
01:24:12.886 --> 01:24:14.637
Well. I hope this did some justice.

1633
01:24:14.721 --> 01:24:16.681
'cause. uh. I don't know what
we could do better than that.

1634
01:24:16.765 --> 01:24:18.850
No. I think you guys
engaged with something

1635
01:24:18.933 --> 01:24:21.144
that most people
don't want to engage with.

1636
01:24:21.227 --> 01:24:22.354
Mm-hm.

1637
01:24:22.437 --> 01:24:24.272
It doesn't look as human
as I thought it would.

1638
01:24:24.356 --> 01:24:27.275
Yeah. Well. Ryan. thank you so much.
Thank you.

1639
01:24:27.359 --> 01:24:29.235
I really appreciate it.
Thank you. brother.

1640
01:24:29.319 --> 01:24:30.820
Thank you. guys.

1641
01:24:30.904 --> 01:24:33.365
Alright. Well. let's. uh.
load up the gear and get out.

1642
01:24:33.448 --> 01:24:34.824
Let's go. let's go.

1643
01:24:34.908 --> 01:24:36.659
And let's make sure
we have night vision.

1644
01:24:36.743 --> 01:24:38.119
Yes.
Thermal.

1645
01:24:39.746 --> 01:24:45.251
I think this could be a free-for-all
out here. Skinwalkers. aliens.

1646
01:24:45.335 --> 01:24:48.004
I mean. dude. it's a party.

1647
01:24:48.088 --> 01:24:50.799
Maybe this is the place where.
like. there's a little leak

1648
01:24:50.882 --> 01:24:54.302
in the system and things
kind of can pass through

1649
01:24:54.386 --> 01:24:56.137
and you're like "Oh. shit."

1650
01:24:56.221 --> 01:25:00.141
This is. like. Bourbon Street
for paranormal.

1651
01:25:00.225 --> 01:25:02.352
You know what I'm saying.

1652
01:25:02.435 --> 01:25:05.480
You know. the funny thing about
being in the Uinta Basin.

1653
01:25:05.563 --> 01:25:07.440
people are kind of drawn here

1654
01:25:07.524 --> 01:25:13.196
for specific things. UFOs.
portals. cryptids. skinwalkers.

1655
01:25:13.279 --> 01:25:16.533
But when you come here
looking for it.

1656
01:25:16.616 --> 01:25:19.828
I often find you find something
you're not looking for.

1657
01:25:20.787 --> 01:25:25.667
We came here looking for UFOs.
and I think we found something

1658
01:25:25.750 --> 01:25:28.795
that would go
into the "other than" category.

1659
01:25:28.878 --> 01:25:32.257
Yes. So we've seen a light.
we've seen a moving shadow.

1660
01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:33.550
Yep.

1661
01:25:33.633 --> 01:25:35.635
We've seen. uh.
something blinking in the sky

1662
01:25:35.719 --> 01:25:38.888
and we've seen a partridge
in a pear tree.

1663
01:25:38.972 --> 01:25:40.640
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.

1664
01:25:40.724 --> 01:25:43.727
I've never been
to a place like this. ever.

1665
01:25:43.810 --> 01:25:45.061
Yeah.

1666
01:25:45.145 --> 01:25:46.688
It's its own realm over here.

1667
01:25:46.771 --> 01:25:49.149
It really is. it does feel
like a different place.

1668
01:25:49.232 --> 01:25:50.525
like its own entity.

1669
01:25:56.156 --> 01:25:59.284
