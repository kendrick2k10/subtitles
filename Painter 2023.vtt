00:03:30.125 --> 00:03:34.375
"Friends took the bike
to roam around."

4
00:03:35.875 --> 00:03:37.666
Hey. Painter! Painter!

5
00:03:39.916 --> 00:03:41.166
I need you here. man!

6
00:03:43.375 --> 00:03:47.166
"Friends took the bike
to roam around."

7
00:03:48.166 --> 00:03:50.250
"Friends took the bike..."

8
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.166
Come on now.
I need to buy sweets too.

9
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.750
Bought it today

10
00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:09.291
Please write it

11
00:04:10.125 --> 00:04:11.125
use your brush

12
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.000
I want you to write surname.

13
00:04:14.375 --> 00:04:15.375
Sidhu.

14
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.625
To start your day.

15
00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:20.166
When I opened my eyes
in the morning.

16
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.541
I heard the chirping of birds.

17
00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.000
A gust of wind filled my heart.

18
00:04:26.375 --> 00:04:27.541
Then when

19
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.625
the first ray of sun hit my face.

20
00:04:33.125 --> 00:04:34.791
my day had started only then.

21
00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:39.166
Wow! Nice! What a poem!

22
00:04:39.625 --> 00:04:41.375
Now please write
surname for me too.

23
00:04:42.375 --> 00:04:43.625
Bro. I don't write.

24
00:04:43.916 --> 00:04:45.166
You can get it done
from somewhere else.

25
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.916
Why? Do you have henna
on your hands?

26
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.125
You have the colours
and the brush too.

27
00:04:49.875 --> 00:04:51.750
Please write it.
Take some extra money.

28
00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:52.750
What's the problem?

29
00:04:52.791 --> 00:04:54.125
The problem is that you are

30
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.416
in the wrong place
for your job to get done.

31
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.125
He is not that kind of painter.
He is a different one.

32
00:04:59.375 --> 00:05:00.875
What is that different kind?

33
00:05:00.916 --> 00:05:03.666
A painter is a painter.
Come on. man!

34
00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:06.000
At the same time.
the customer is a form of God.

35
00:05:06.125 --> 00:05:07.416
and he is denying God himself.

36
00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:10.791
If it goes on like this.
he will die of hunger.

37
00:05:10.875 --> 00:05:12.250
Hey. boy!

38
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.750
Bring tea and hot fritters.

39
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.000
Look at him!

40
00:05:31.125 --> 00:05:34.250
Guys like him borrow
a bike from others

41
00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:38.000
and then roam around as if he
has bought it. Such an item he was!

42
00:05:40.125 --> 00:05:42.500
Leave it. The poor guy was naive.

43
00:05:43.625 --> 00:05:44.500
How would he know?

44
00:05:45.916 --> 00:05:47.875
You are also quite naive.
a man of God.

45
00:05:48.041 --> 00:05:50.041
You also don't know
anything about worldliness.

46
00:05:51.875 --> 00:05:53.916
It is better to be
ignorant of worldliness.

47
00:05:55.875 --> 00:05:57.375
If you want to know.

48
00:05:58.375 --> 00:06:00.250
then keep an eye
on the nature around you.

49
00:06:00.791 --> 00:06:02.541
That is what is it
trying to talk to us.

50
00:06:03.791 --> 00:06:05.750
It's trying to tell us
something all the time.

51
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.125
Teaching us something.
Explaining something.

52
00:06:10.291 --> 00:06:11.875
Even I can't understand you. man.

53
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.750
But I enjoy talking to you.

54
00:06:13.791 --> 00:06:17.625
Your words and my fritters.
Here. have it.

55
00:06:18.875 --> 00:06:20.375
I've told you so many times.

56
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.416
Change your job profile a bit.

57
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.791
At the same time. start the work
of writing. You can earn more.

58
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.625
The use of money
gives greed to man.

59
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.541
It has swallowed the
world without teeth.

60
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.875
Don't tell me stories about money.

61
00:06:38.375 --> 00:06:40.375
I have a sky of colours

62
00:06:42.041 --> 00:06:43.625
and the land of the canvas.

63
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.625
Tell me. what else do you want?

64
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.375
Life doesn't go on
with such thoughts.

65
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.625
You have got to go
the way the world goes.

66
00:06:53.666 --> 00:06:55.000
It is your illusion.

67
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.875
A person's thinking is
his world and his life.

68
00:07:00.625 --> 00:07:01.625
I am happy the way I am.

69
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.125
Here we go. You are happy.

70
00:07:10.375 --> 00:07:13.416
but it seems that God is angry.
The weather turned bad.

71
00:07:14.291 --> 00:07:16.250
Now people will eat
my fritters fiercely.

72
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.375
Great! Let me go and earn something.

73
00:07:19.416 --> 00:07:21.125
Okay. then.

74
00:07:36.291 --> 00:07:37.500
Bad?

75
00:07:39.166 --> 00:07:41.166
It looks quite nice to me.

76
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:32.500
"Now the moon is here.
and the earth went up there."

77
00:08:38.416 --> 00:08:44.500
"Now the moon is here.
and the earth went up there."

78
00:08:44.875 --> 00:08:51.541
"Ever since I saw you.
my vision became clear."

79
00:08:54.125 --> 00:09:01.416
"I'm reading your
face like a story."

80
00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:08.666
"Like heaven on earth."

81
00:09:09.375 --> 00:09:16.125
"Like heaven on earth."

82
00:09:28.666 --> 00:09:35.250
"My paintings' actions
are now calling your name."

83
00:09:35.291 --> 00:09:42.125
"Like nature has
put on a new dress."

84
00:09:44.875 --> 00:09:51.000
"By setting the shade of gold
coloured water in the heart."

85
00:09:51.125 --> 00:09:58.000
"Clay toys are walking
towards the stars today."

86
00:10:01.125 --> 00:10:07.875
"My life has become
a series of colours."

87
00:10:08.375 --> 00:10:15.250
"Like heaven on earth."

88
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:22.875
"Like heaven on earth."

89
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.500
"Nowadays. I observe things
with my eyes."

90
00:10:41.625 --> 00:10:48.291
"I pay attention
to even the little things."

91
00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:57.541
"Dewdrops dance on flowers
and leaves in the morning."

92
00:10:57.625 --> 00:11:04.791
"Even in the water. there is
a match of colours of its own."

93
00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:14.250
"The way lightning hides
in the clouds."

94
00:11:14.291 --> 00:11:21.875
"Like heaven on earth."

95
00:11:21.916 --> 00:11:30.500
"Like heaven on earth."

96
00:11:40.875 --> 00:11:41.750
Wow!

97
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.000
She is very pretty.

98
00:11:44.666 --> 00:11:45.625
Who is she?

99
00:11:46.916 --> 00:11:48.250
Dark coloured flower

100
00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:50.750
of a beautiful woman.

101
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:53.500
Like coal is the decoration

102
00:11:53.875 --> 00:11:55.250
of the burning fuel.

103
00:11:55.791 --> 00:11:57.750
Uh... Coal!

104
00:12:04.125 --> 00:12:06.125
Glow on the forehead.
Passion in the eyes.

105
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:07.625
The noise of silence on the lips.

106
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.375
Meet me when it rains.

107
00:12:22.125 --> 00:12:23.500
My word!

108
00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:26.000
You are amazing!

109
00:12:27.875 --> 00:12:29.750
People make the whole incomplete.

110
00:12:30.375 --> 00:12:32.000
and you have completed
the incomplete.

111
00:12:32.625 --> 00:12:34.250
Wow!
- No.

112
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.625
it's still incomplete.

113
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.250
But still.

114
00:12:40.375 --> 00:12:41.625
you have done an amazing job.

115
00:12:42.166 --> 00:12:44.041
I didn't make it.
It just got made itself.

116
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:47.625
By the God

117
00:12:48.625 --> 00:12:49.625
and also by me.

118
00:13:04.125 --> 00:13:06.291
Dad. I missed you so much.

119
00:13:06.916 --> 00:13:09.125
We missed you too dear.

120
00:13:09.166 --> 00:13:11.000
You've came back after 3 years.

121
00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:15.041
Happy birthday. Simi. dear.
- Aww! Thank you so much. Dad.

122
00:13:15.625 --> 00:13:18.791
But this is not done. My gift?

123
00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.875
Surprise!
- Hmm? Wow!

124
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.625
I'm so excited!

125
00:13:23.791 --> 00:13:28.500
But. Dad. you didn't spoil my
surprise for your surprise. did you?

126
00:13:29.125 --> 00:13:29.916
Mm-mm.

127
00:13:30.666 --> 00:13:33.750
Then it's fine.
Let's just hurry back home now.

128
00:13:34.291 --> 00:13:35.750
Sure. honey.

129
00:13:36.375 --> 00:13:38.291
Shinde. take the car to the market.

130
00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.000
Stop the car. Stop it here.

131
00:13:44.375 --> 00:13:46.416
Simi dear. you just sit here.
I'll be back.

132
00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.125
Simi. what happened?

133
00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:38.125
Do you want something?

134
00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:40.500
Dad. look at this.

135
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.666
How beautifully made!

136
00:14:44.791 --> 00:14:46.000
I want this one.

137
00:14:46.416 --> 00:14:47.625
I want this.

138
00:14:48.791 --> 00:14:50.166
Huh! Right away!

139
00:14:54.625 --> 00:14:57.000
Painter. Hey. Painter!

140
00:15:01.666 --> 00:15:02.916
Greetings. Sir.

141
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.375
Everything is all right.

142
00:15:07.166 --> 00:15:09.625
My girl has liked
this painting of yours.

143
00:15:10.416 --> 00:15:12.125
And it's her birthday too.

144
00:15:12.375 --> 00:15:14.416
Do one thing. Give it to her.

145
00:15:15.875 --> 00:15:17.416
Please forgive me but not this one.

146
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:20.500
You can have something else.

147
00:15:21.625 --> 00:15:22.750
Why anything else?

148
00:15:23.125 --> 00:15:24.625
I like this one.

149
00:15:25.041 --> 00:15:27.000
You just say the amount.
How much do you want?

150
00:15:30.125 --> 00:15:32.500
No. Sir. It's not about the money.

151
00:15:32.916 --> 00:15:35.875
Actually. it's not finished yet.
It's incomplete.

152
00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:39.541
I want only this one!

153
00:15:40.041 --> 00:15:42.166
Send it home when
you are done with it.

154
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.541
Let's go. Dad. Huh!

155
00:15:54.625 --> 00:15:56.500
Tell me. how come you are here?

156
00:15:56.875 --> 00:15:57.666
What should I say?

157
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
I am here to tell
about my husband's misdeeds.

158
00:16:01.125 --> 00:16:03.291
Oho! Now what happened?

159
00:16:03.375 --> 00:16:05.875
What else! He Roams
around during the day

160
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.750
and beats me up at night.

161
00:16:08.125 --> 00:16:10.125
I am fed up with all this.

162
00:16:10.666 --> 00:16:12.500
Please tell Sir
and send him to jail.

163
00:16:12.791 --> 00:16:14.791
I'll take what's left of my life.

164
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.875
Where is he? - Don't know where
he has gone since morning.

165
00:16:19.166 --> 00:16:21.375
He didn't even tell me.

166
00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:24.000
Hey. Ramu! Give me my mobile.

167
00:16:24.375 --> 00:16:25.875
Let me ask him when he'll be here.

168
00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.000
Mm! Leave it now!

169
00:16:33.625 --> 00:16:34.625
Simi!

170
00:16:34.666 --> 00:16:36.125
Surprise!

171
00:16:39.875 --> 00:16:40.666
Thank God!

172
00:16:41.375 --> 00:16:42.625
I'm so glad to see you.

173
00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:44.500
Oh!

174
00:16:45.125 --> 00:16:47.500
So you guys were planning this.

175
00:16:47.541 --> 00:16:50.125
Brother. I put my husband in jail.

176
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:51.750
He's ruined my life.

177
00:16:52.166 --> 00:16:55.875
Look. Bachno. Don't
do bad to anyone today.

178
00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:59.125
Today is my baby girl's birthday.

179
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.166
Happy birthday. Honey.

180
00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:04.000
Thank you. Mom. I love you.

181
00:17:04.041 --> 00:17:06.125
Love you too. my love.

182
00:17:06.375 --> 00:17:07.791
Listen. madam.

183
00:17:07.875 --> 00:17:09.500
today is your baby girl's birthday.

184
00:17:09.791 --> 00:17:12.375
Won't I get something
on this occasion?

185
00:17:13.041 --> 00:17:14.875
Be here in the evening
with your husband.

186
00:17:15.875 --> 00:17:17.041
You will get everything.

187
00:17:17.375 --> 00:17:19.500
Hmm.
- Sure. Sir.

188
00:17:23.125 --> 00:17:24.125
Madam.

189
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.375
don't stare at me like that.

190
00:17:26.875 --> 00:17:28.500
It was all your daughter's plan.

191
00:17:29.125 --> 00:17:30.291
I had nothing to do with this.

192
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:34.791
No. Mom. I swear I didn't
know anything. It was

193
00:17:36.041 --> 00:17:37.166
all Dad's planning.

194
00:17:37.541 --> 00:17:39.000
What!
- Hmm.

195
00:17:39.625 --> 00:17:42.291
Now that you are with your mother.
you joined her. - Of course.

196
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.250
Here's your gift!

197
00:17:53.875 --> 00:17:55.541
Wow! Dad.

198
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:58.750
it got finished?
- I bought it as it is.

199
00:17:58.875 --> 00:18:00.500
How can it happen that my girl

200
00:18:00.625 --> 00:18:03.125
likes something and does
not get it when I am there?

201
00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:05.416
Hmm?
- Aww!

202
00:18:05.541 --> 00:18:06.416
Dad.

203
00:18:08.125 --> 00:18:10.000
Love you. Dad. I love you so much.

204
00:18:10.375 --> 00:18:13.750
Love you too.
- Thank you for this.

205
00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:16.125
Come on now.

206
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:36.666
"I brought a convoy
of flowers for you."

207
00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:40.666
At your doorsteps.

208
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:52.375
"The song I once sang while
sitting alone is stuck in my mind."

209
00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:59.000
"I brought a convoy
of flowers for you."

210
00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.791
At your doorsteps.

211
00:19:05.541 --> 00:19:14.750
"The song I once sang while
sitting alone is stuck in my mind."

212
00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:44.666
"Best wishes for the light
on your forehead."

213
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:50.416
"I don't want to wake up
from the sleep of your dreams."

214
00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:55.875
"I don't want to wake up
from the sleep of your dreams."

215
00:19:56.041 --> 00:20:04.875
"My heart beats so that
no tears fall in your destiny."

216
00:20:07.166 --> 00:20:11.666
"I brought a convoy
of flowers for you."

217
00:20:12.041 --> 00:20:15.375
At your doorsteps.

218
00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:25.750
"The song I once sang while
sitting alone is stuck in my mind."

219
00:20:42.541 --> 00:20:44.500
Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

220
00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:47.666
Thank you.

221
00:20:48.291 --> 00:20:50.791
We are so lucky to have you here.

222
00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:52.791
Meet him.

223
00:20:53.166 --> 00:20:54.750
He is Mr. Painter.

224
00:20:55.166 --> 00:20:58.500
He looks like Juliet's Romeo

225
00:20:59.041 --> 00:21:01.791
but has the swagger of Bond.

226
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:05.000
After all. you gave the painting.

227
00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:06.791
Mm-mm. I didn't give it.

228
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Pardon?

229
00:21:55.291 --> 00:21:57.625
I don't want this
painting like this.

230
00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:02.375
I'm sorry on his behalf.

231
00:22:09.375 --> 00:22:10.916
Shall we? Greetings.

232
00:22:14.125 --> 00:22:15.375
But tell me. at least.

233
00:22:15.875 --> 00:22:16.750
who is she?

234
00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:19.541
Tell me. how much do you want?

235
00:22:20.625 --> 00:22:21.625
Five lakh rupees?

236
00:22:24.791 --> 00:22:25.875
Ten lakh rupees?

237
00:22:35.541 --> 00:22:36.916
I just want the right price.

238
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.666
It's not just money.
It can be anything.

239
00:22:41.041 --> 00:22:42.875
It can be the respect of the eyes

240
00:22:43.625 --> 00:22:45.625
or the sweetness
of the way you talk.

241
00:22:46.375 --> 00:22:48.125
It could be a smile.

242
00:22:49.375 --> 00:22:51.125
and it could be a tear too.

243
00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:56.625
But it is incomplete at the moment.

244
00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:05.041
Yes. I'm a maid.

245
00:23:05.791 --> 00:23:07.875
Yes. I'm a maid.

246
00:23:08.625 --> 00:23:11.125
I go to people's houses
and clean them.

247
00:23:11.875 --> 00:23:14.500
Fulfils every order of the owners.

248
00:23:16.041 --> 00:23:18.166
But being a maid is not a crime.

249
00:23:19.166 --> 00:23:20.500
They all are servants here.

250
00:23:21.625 --> 00:23:24.291
Everyone is working
under someone or the other.

251
00:23:25.125 --> 00:23:27.500
Some do it out of passion.
and some out of compulsion.

252
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:29.875
Some are doing it for greed.

253
00:23:30.416 --> 00:23:33.166
She's good for maid's role.
- We are all servants of God.

254
00:23:33.625 --> 00:23:35.041
It's not the job
that is big or small.

255
00:23:35.625 --> 00:23:37.000
It's the thinking that matters.

256
00:23:38.291 --> 00:23:41.541
It's all written in karma.

257
00:23:43.625 --> 00:23:45.875
But when nature plays its game.

258
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:48.125
it does not take long
for the master to become

259
00:23:48.166 --> 00:23:50.125
the servant and the servant
to become the master.

260
00:23:50.875 --> 00:23:51.916
Luck is like that.

261
00:23:52.541 --> 00:23:54.166
It can change anytime.

262
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:57.041
But people's taunts never go away.

263
00:23:57.875 --> 00:24:00.625
They always live
in our minds as sorrow.

264
00:24:01.416 --> 00:24:05.000
What kind of justice
is it to taunt others

265
00:24:06.416 --> 00:24:08.875
by being a servant yourself?
- Cut it. madam.

266
00:24:09.125 --> 00:24:10.000
Take some rest.

267
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.791
You were given
only two lines to act.

268
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.500
and you acted for
the complete reel.

269
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:17.750
Also. it's a maid's role.

270
00:24:18.125 --> 00:24:20.250
You were reading the whole script.

271
00:24:20.791 --> 00:24:21.916
Maid's role?

272
00:24:23.125 --> 00:24:25.500
I was told that there are auditions
for the lead character.

273
00:24:25.625 --> 00:24:27.875
Yes. for the lead character too.

274
00:24:28.375 --> 00:24:31.416
But seeing your look. you have
been given the role of a maid.

275
00:24:32.041 --> 00:24:34.250
The character's role
is small but very good.

276
00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:39.416
Congrats. you are selected.
- Hello! Learn to respect talent.

277
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.875
I am not here to be a maid.

278
00:24:42.125 --> 00:24:43.416
I am here to be the lead actor.

279
00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:45.166
Next!

280
00:24:45.875 --> 00:24:47.125
But. Sir...
- Next.

281
00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:49.166
Sir...
- Madam. please.

282
00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:50.625
Please leave.

283
00:24:53.541 --> 00:24:54.541
What happened?

284
00:24:55.291 --> 00:24:57.125
The same as usual.

285
00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:00.000
They saw my complexion
but not my talent.

286
00:25:00.916 --> 00:25:03.166
They were asking me to do
a small role of a maid. Huh!

287
00:25:03.625 --> 00:25:05.375
A maid! My foot!

288
00:25:06.666 --> 00:25:10.541
It's okay. We'll go to some other
audition. You just don't worry.

289
00:25:11.375 --> 00:25:12.791
Let's have tea.

290
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.750
Two cups of tea. please.

291
00:25:38.666 --> 00:25:39.375
Here. Tea.

292
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.500
These big companies don't even
give big roles to small artists.

293
00:25:58.166 --> 00:26:01.541
I can't become a big actress
by doing small roles.

294
00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.375
Industry taunts seeing
the tag of a junior artist.

295
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.125
You know that.

296
00:26:09.125 --> 00:26:11.250
Yeah. I know.

297
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:14.625
That's why you should never give up.

298
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.166
I will never let you give up.

299
00:26:17.791 --> 00:26:19.500
I won't give up.

300
00:26:19.625 --> 00:26:23.291
Those who think that beauty is seen
only in colour will accept defeat.

301
00:26:24.125 --> 00:26:27.625
Those who think small-town
people are just part of the crowd.

302
00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:31.250
I will work in a
bigger studio than this.

303
00:26:31.916 --> 00:26:33.125
That. too. as a lead.

304
00:26:34.375 --> 00:26:36.250
May that day come soon.

305
00:26:36.875 --> 00:26:38.916
May you also find someone
different from the world

306
00:26:39.416 --> 00:26:41.166
who only sees your talent.

307
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:44.750
Just don't get upset.

308
00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:47.041
I'm not getting upset.

309
00:26:47.375 --> 00:26:48.916
I know I'm very talented

310
00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:50.666
and pretty too.

311
00:26:51.125 --> 00:26:52.500
Swine doesn't know

312
00:26:52.541 --> 00:26:55.500
the value of pearls.

313
00:27:16.416 --> 00:27:17.250
Hello.

314
00:27:18.291 --> 00:27:19.125
Hello.

315
00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:20.666
'Greetings. Aunt.'

316
00:27:21.666 --> 00:27:23.125
Greetings. my dear.

317
00:27:23.916 --> 00:27:24.750
How are you?

318
00:27:25.166 --> 00:27:26.500
It's all good here. Aunt.

319
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.291
Where is Sara my dear?

320
00:27:28.416 --> 00:27:30.000
Aunt. she is in taking shower.

321
00:27:30.125 --> 00:27:31.125
Taking shower?

322
00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:31.750
Yes.

323
00:27:32.041 --> 00:27:33.666
Pali dear. you also come someday

324
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:36.500
I will definitely come.
Here is Sara.

325
00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:42.500
Greetings. Mom.

326
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.291
Greetings. my dear.

327
00:27:45.166 --> 00:27:46.500
How was your day?

328
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.750
Today's? It was great.

329
00:27:50.416 --> 00:27:52.375
They have shortlisted me.

330
00:27:53.041 --> 00:27:54.500
They will call me soon.

331
00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:58.500
Don't know in which list do they put you.

332
00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:05.250
It's been 3 years since you're trying to become an actress.

333
00:28:05.875 --> 00:28:07.500
Nothing has happened yet.

334
00:28:08.166 --> 00:28:10.125
I'm very close to my goal now.

335
00:28:10.666 --> 00:28:12.916
Three-four studios
have shortlisted me.

336
00:28:13.875 --> 00:28:15.750
Some or the other movie
will definitely start.

337
00:28:16.375 --> 00:28:17.375
I really believe it.

338
00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:19.375
My dear.

339
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.041
These films..

340
00:28:21.625 --> 00:28:23.375
Are not meant for people like us.

341
00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:26.000
These are better suited for rich people.

342
00:28:26.875 --> 00:28:28.375
My dear. come back home.

343
00:28:29.291 --> 00:28:32.750
I've got 2-3 good marriage propsals for you.

344
00:28:33.416 --> 00:28:35.000
Yes. Mom. I'm ready to get married.

345
00:28:35.625 --> 00:28:37.000
But after becoming an actress.

346
00:28:37.791 --> 00:28:40.125
I can't think of anything else

347
00:28:40.875 --> 00:28:42.500
until my dream comes true.

348
00:28:44.875 --> 00:28:48.375
Anyone can see illusion of water in dessert.

349
00:28:49.791 --> 00:28:54.166
But theres no surity of that illusion turning to reality.

350
00:28:55.375 --> 00:28:57.625
If your father was alive today.

351
00:28:58.125 --> 00:29:00.541
He would have brought you back home.

352
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:03.375
Come back home my dear.

353
00:29:05.875 --> 00:29:07.125
Good night.

354
00:29:10.791 --> 00:29:12.041
Good night.

355
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.125
Greetings. Mr. Painter.

356
00:29:26.791 --> 00:29:28.791
Hello. Jagya. How are you?

357
00:29:28.875 --> 00:29:30.750
I'm fine.
- What's new?

358
00:29:30.791 --> 00:29:32.916
New...
- How was Nimmi's wedding?

359
00:29:33.291 --> 00:29:34.750
Yes. it was great.

360
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000
I am going to her place.

361
00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:38.625
I'm thinking of
getting her something.

362
00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:42.041
Uh... How much for this picture?

363
00:29:43.791 --> 00:29:46.250
How much do you have?
- I just have...

364
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:49.000
Here. That's all I have.

365
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.375
That's more than enough.

366
00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:04.541
Tell your dad to
clear the previous bills.

367
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.291
Here. Take this.

368
00:30:06.875 --> 00:30:08.250
Here. Get going.

369
00:30:09.125 --> 00:30:12.000
Oh! Madam. it's you!
Greetings. wait a minute.

370
00:30:14.875 --> 00:30:15.791
Please have a seat.

371
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:18.916
Madam. what would you
like to have? Tea or fritters?

372
00:30:19.916 --> 00:30:21.000
First. tell me.

373
00:30:21.625 --> 00:30:24.041
do you make all this
to sell or for yourself?

374
00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:26.166
Pardon? What do you mean?

375
00:30:26.541 --> 00:30:30.000
I mean. do your tea and
fritters have any price.

376
00:30:30.625 --> 00:30:32.750
or are they priceless like

377
00:30:33.041 --> 00:30:34.500
that painter's painting?

378
00:30:34.916 --> 00:30:36.625
Oh! Not at all.

379
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:38.041
I'm a pure businessman.

380
00:30:38.125 --> 00:30:41.000
If someone gives me a higher price.
I will be sold immediately.

381
00:30:41.125 --> 00:30:42.625
let alone these fritters.

382
00:30:44.875 --> 00:30:48.000
What kind of person is this
who rejected ten lakh rupees?

383
00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:51.041
This is not an ordinary man.
He is a resident of another world.

384
00:30:51.125 --> 00:30:53.291
God accidentally sent him
into this world.

385
00:30:54.625 --> 00:30:55.666
I didn't get you.

386
00:30:56.541 --> 00:30:57.500
It's just that

387
00:30:58.125 --> 00:31:00.625
he has no attachment to money.
No concern for the world.

388
00:31:01.541 --> 00:31:03.500
He is the king
of the world of colours.

389
00:31:03.916 --> 00:31:05.250
You can't say anything about him.

390
00:31:05.375 --> 00:31:08.125
He can give things
worth lakhs for pennies

391
00:31:08.166 --> 00:31:10.166
and won't give things
worth pennies. even in lakhs.

392
00:31:11.375 --> 00:31:13.125
The way he sees

393
00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:16.166
and feels nature.
he only acts with nature.

394
00:31:17.375 --> 00:31:19.000
Acts?
- Yes!

395
00:31:19.291 --> 00:31:20.750
He acts with nature.

396
00:31:22.166 --> 00:31:23.500
Interact!

397
00:31:23.791 --> 00:31:25.750
Yeah. same thing. Act.

398
00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.916
People call him mad
when they listen to him.

399
00:31:29.625 --> 00:31:33.291
Only God knows if he is mad
or if people are.

400
00:31:34.375 --> 00:31:35.375
And that painting...

401
00:31:35.875 --> 00:31:38.791
The girl in it. is she special

402
00:31:38.875 --> 00:31:40.500
that he doesn't want to sell it?

403
00:31:40.875 --> 00:31:42.250
Even he doesn't know that.

404
00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:44.750
He got a torn picture one day.

405
00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:47.125
He finished it with his art.

406
00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:49.500
There's nothing more special
than colours for him.

407
00:31:50.041 --> 00:31:52.000
Hey. boy. give me that glass.

408
00:31:59.166 --> 00:32:01.750
Yes. darling. Why are you worried?

409
00:32:01.791 --> 00:32:03.500
I got your work done.

410
00:32:03.875 --> 00:32:06.250
Yeah. I am doing
my next movie with Ammy.

411
00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:09.625
What! Don't you know Ammy?

412
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.291
Ammy Wirk. Which other Ammy.
do you know?

413
00:32:13.625 --> 00:32:15.916
Yeah. The film will
be shot in the UK.

414
00:32:18.041 --> 00:32:20.916
Why are you worried about the
expenses? That's the producer's job.

415
00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:24.000
I can go with you if you want.

416
00:32:26.166 --> 00:32:28.875
You can fulfil your promise.

417
00:32:32.541 --> 00:32:34.625
Come on. Don't start again.

418
00:32:35.875 --> 00:32:39.000
I... I already knew that when
you would be a big actress.

419
00:32:39.541 --> 00:32:42.375
then you would ditch me.

420
00:32:43.666 --> 00:32:44.750
Babe...

421
00:32:45.541 --> 00:32:48.041
Okay. I'll call you later. Okay?

422
00:32:48.875 --> 00:32:49.625
Yeah.

423
00:32:50.125 --> 00:32:52.625
Okay. fine. No problem.
We'll talk about it.

424
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.750
Okay. bye. Take care.

425
00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:59.291
Hello.
- Hello. Sir. How are you?

426
00:33:00.125 --> 00:33:02.000
How are you?
- Good.

427
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:05.375
I just came to give you my pictures.

428
00:33:06.166 --> 00:33:07.291
I just got them done.

429
00:33:13.166 --> 00:33:16.500
What was the need to get new
pictures? I already have a lot.

430
00:33:17.791 --> 00:33:19.000
Sir. these pictures...

431
00:33:19.541 --> 00:33:21.125
To whomever I send
your pictures like this.

432
00:33:21.166 --> 00:33:22.500
he sends me back like this.

433
00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:27.250
Sara. dear...

434
00:33:28.375 --> 00:33:30.125
I have told you so many times.

435
00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:33.500
Don't waste your time on lead roles.

436
00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:37.916
Do whatever small character you get.

437
00:33:38.625 --> 00:33:40.500
The one who has to dominate

438
00:33:41.041 --> 00:33:43.250
dominates even in a small scene.

439
00:33:44.875 --> 00:33:47.125
If God wills. you will
also. get the lead role.

440
00:33:47.666 --> 00:33:48.791
Why are you getting worried?

441
00:33:49.166 --> 00:33:50.541
Do you know any such girl

442
00:33:50.875 --> 00:33:53.250
who has become an actress like this?
- Not again. dear.

443
00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:57.500
Use your brain. Play it safe.

444
00:33:58.875 --> 00:34:03.125
Mere acting is not enough
to become an actress.

445
00:34:03.541 --> 00:34:05.041
Much more has to be done.

446
00:34:05.375 --> 00:34:09.041
You'll grow old waiting
for the lead roles.

447
00:34:09.125 --> 00:34:12.250
Then you will get the role
of the actress's aunt or mother.

448
00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:14.625
Listen to me.

449
00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:17.041
and stop dreaming
about the lead roles.

450
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:18.541
Hmm.

451
00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:36.791
Thanks for your concern.

452
00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:40.250
And yeah. if God has put you
on this duty to give advice.

453
00:34:40.375 --> 00:34:43.541
then you should advise someone
to fulfil dreams and not give up.

454
00:34:52.416 --> 00:34:53.916
Hello. Mr. Painter!

455
00:34:54.666 --> 00:34:55.916
You owe me a party.

456
00:34:57.875 --> 00:34:59.250
Party?
- Come on.

457
00:34:59.541 --> 00:35:01.375
You have won a lottery of 30 lakhs.

458
00:35:01.625 --> 00:35:02.791
I should get a party.

459
00:35:05.125 --> 00:35:06.125
A lottery of 30 lakhs?

460
00:35:06.541 --> 00:35:07.500
I didn't get you.

461
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:09.500
The daughter of the village head

462
00:35:09.791 --> 00:35:11.125
whose party we went to.

463
00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:13.125
Huh!
- Birthday party.

464
00:35:13.375 --> 00:35:15.625
She came here.
She was asking about you.

465
00:35:17.375 --> 00:35:19.000
Then?
- Oh!

466
00:35:19.375 --> 00:35:21.541
Innocent man. she likes you.

467
00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:24.375
How do you know?

468
00:35:25.291 --> 00:35:26.125
Really?

469
00:35:26.416 --> 00:35:28.125
As if you know everything.

470
00:35:31.791 --> 00:35:34.541
Once. even I tried a lot for a girl.

471
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:37.000
I have some experience too.

472
00:35:37.625 --> 00:35:40.416
Look. she feels something for you.

473
00:35:42.875 --> 00:35:44.041
Yeah. she does.

474
00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:46.291
I know that.

475
00:35:46.666 --> 00:35:48.625
She feels quite angry
thinking about me.

476
00:35:48.916 --> 00:35:51.500
Anger is the first stage of love.

477
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:53.250
Didn't you see Romeo and Juliet?

478
00:35:54.916 --> 00:35:56.875
You can use your
experience elsewhere.

479
00:35:57.375 --> 00:35:59.000
I don't care about all that.

480
00:36:00.416 --> 00:36:02.000
You know that very well.

481
00:36:04.625 --> 00:36:05.666
That's the problem.

482
00:36:07.375 --> 00:36:09.041
I know it all too well.

483
00:36:11.291 --> 00:36:12.500
Now youth is in full swing.

484
00:36:14.041 --> 00:36:16.875
There is no feeling
of lack of anything at this age.

485
00:36:18.041 --> 00:36:21.250
Everyone needs someone
to take care of in old age.

486
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000
If I don't think about you.
then who else will?

487
00:36:28.291 --> 00:36:29.250
I think

488
00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:34.625
about a sister-in-law like Simi.
I mean. exactly. Simi.

489
00:36:35.125 --> 00:36:37.250
The one who takes
care of you. your house.

490
00:36:37.625 --> 00:36:40.375
your colours. and your paintings.

491
00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.541
Then you will have two
or three young painters

492
00:36:45.666 --> 00:36:47.875
who would jump here and there.

493
00:36:48.625 --> 00:36:51.500
And then I'll make hot
and crispy fritters for them.

494
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.791
If you are settled.

495
00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:58.666
then my worries will be over.

496
00:37:01.791 --> 00:37:04.541
Think about it.
She is a Canadian return.

497
00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:06.375
Do you know that
people roam around with

498
00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:08.041
30 lakh rupees to
marry a Canadian girl?

499
00:37:09.041 --> 00:37:10.250
And you are happy like this.

500
00:37:10.666 --> 00:37:12.875
Think. bro! Canada!

501
00:37:14.791 --> 00:37:16.791
What will I do in a foreign country?

502
00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:20.875
I am happy in my country land.

503
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.916
So take some soil
from here with you.

504
00:37:23.875 --> 00:37:25.750
People even take
scooters and tractors

505
00:37:25.875 --> 00:37:28.000
to Canada. so you
can take a bit of soil.

506
00:37:29.875 --> 00:37:32.750
Look. you don't have
to arrange any money.

507
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.625
You just have to love a little.

508
00:37:35.791 --> 00:37:38.500
You don't try to love.
You just fall in love.

509
00:37:39.291 --> 00:37:40.375
And when there is love.

510
00:37:41.166 --> 00:37:43.166
you can't think of anything else.

511
00:37:44.791 --> 00:37:47.125
And anyway. love happens only once.

512
00:37:50.291 --> 00:37:53.375
and I'm in love
with this world of mine.

513
00:37:55.125 --> 00:37:56.625
Now this is everything to me.

514
00:37:58.250 --> 00:38:00.375
I don't need any more love.

515
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.666
Uh...
- Can I do some work now?

516
00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:07.500
Your customers must be
looking for you at your shop.

517
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.916
Your tea is going to get cold.
Drink it.

518
00:38:35.041 --> 00:38:36.000
Sara.

519
00:38:37.125 --> 00:38:38.125
I ordered food for us.

520
00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:41.250
Will you please serve it?
I'll freshen up in 2 minutes.

521
00:39:05.875 --> 00:39:06.666
Guess what?

522
00:39:07.416 --> 00:39:10.041
What?
- I have good news for you.

523
00:39:10.541 --> 00:39:11.916
Good news?
- Hmm.

524
00:39:12.166 --> 00:39:13.166
What is it?

525
00:39:13.416 --> 00:39:16.000
Have some patience. Let
me eat first. then I'll tell you.

526
00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:19.291
No. I can't. Tell me right now.

527
00:39:19.875 --> 00:39:22.500
Come on... - I won't eat.
What is this?

528
00:39:27.375 --> 00:39:30.666
I met a producer
at the ad shoot. I went to.

529
00:39:30.916 --> 00:39:33.375
He wants a girl exactly
like you for his movie.

530
00:39:33.875 --> 00:39:36.375
I showed him your pictures
and also told him about you.

531
00:39:36.875 --> 00:39:40.250
And the good news is
that he's called you over tomorrow.

532
00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:42.291
Really?
- Yes!

533
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Thank you. Paali.

534
00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:46.291
Don't thank me now. Say it later.

535
00:39:46.541 --> 00:39:48.625
First. go and meet him tomorrow.

536
00:39:48.875 --> 00:39:49.875
Now let me eat.

537
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:01.791
Hello. Sir.

538
00:40:03.875 --> 00:40:04.625
Hello.

539
00:40:04.916 --> 00:40:06.750
Have a seat.
- Thank you.

540
00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:12.625
Uh... Sara.

541
00:40:13.875 --> 00:40:14.791
Sara Hayat Ali.

542
00:40:15.125 --> 00:40:16.000
Yeah. good name.

543
00:40:16.291 --> 00:40:17.625
Are you a local from Chandigarh?

544
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.291
No. Sir. I belong to Malerkotla.

545
00:40:20.875 --> 00:40:22.625
I live here for work.

546
00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:24.250
Okay.

547
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.416
I saw your audition.

548
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:27.875
I liked it.

549
00:40:28.791 --> 00:40:30.166
Have you worked before?

550
00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:32.375
No. Sir. I'm still looking
for my break.

551
00:40:32.666 --> 00:40:34.875
But I did theatre
from school to college.

552
00:40:35.375 --> 00:40:38.041
I did a lot of skits
and stage plays.

553
00:40:38.625 --> 00:40:42.000
Seeing my acting.
I always got the lead role.

554
00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:45.166
I thought about leading
in films after the theatre.

555
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.166
but no one noticed my talent here.

556
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:50.750
It can be noticed.

557
00:40:51.916 --> 00:40:53.541
but people don't want to notice.

558
00:40:54.791 --> 00:40:57.875
They are all conventional.
They don't want to try new things.

559
00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:00.250
I have thought something different.

560
00:41:01.125 --> 00:41:02.875
Different than world. something new.

561
00:41:03.791 --> 00:41:06.875
I want to bring a different concept.

562
00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:08.750
I appreciate it. Sir.

563
00:41:09.916 --> 00:41:11.750
I am going to announce
a movie very soon.

564
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.666
This film is the story of a girl

565
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.250
whom the world tries to suppress.

566
00:41:17.625 --> 00:41:18.416
But that girl

567
00:41:19.166 --> 00:41:20.541
will not be suppressed.

568
00:41:20.916 --> 00:41:22.916
Wow! It's a great concept.

569
00:41:23.291 --> 00:41:25.000
Your face is very charming.

570
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.375
You're very beautiful.

571
00:41:26.875 --> 00:41:28.375
Different from other girls.

572
00:41:29.125 --> 00:41:32.041
you have all the qualities it takes
to become a star.

573
00:41:33.625 --> 00:41:35.750
And I'll make you a star.

574
00:41:36.041 --> 00:41:38.625
I am signing you
in a lead role in this film.

575
00:41:39.625 --> 00:41:42.375
Thank you so much. Sir.
- Welcome to the board.

576
00:41:42.625 --> 00:41:43.625
Thank you. Sir.

577
00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:50.375
What happened?

578
00:41:52.375 --> 00:41:54.250
Tell me. what happened?

579
00:42:01.916 --> 00:42:03.291
Still no positive outcome?

580
00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:06.375
No problem.

581
00:42:06.625 --> 00:42:09.625
I know another producer.
We'll go to him.

582
00:42:16.875 --> 00:42:19.625
Yay!

583
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:23.291
Oh my! Thank God!

584
00:42:23.791 --> 00:42:25.916
Do you know that since the morning

585
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.375
I had a very strong intuition
of good news? - This is it.

586
00:42:29.166 --> 00:42:30.541
I just needed my first break.

587
00:42:31.291 --> 00:42:32.791
Now I will give my best.

588
00:42:33.041 --> 00:42:34.666
Yes.
- I have to work hard day and night.

589
00:42:35.125 --> 00:42:38.875
You deserve more. Sara. This
is just the beginning. You'll see.

590
00:42:38.916 --> 00:42:40.875
People will only talk
about you everywhere.

591
00:42:40.916 --> 00:42:42.666
TV. Radio. Cinema.

592
00:42:43.125 --> 00:42:45.500
Sara will be everywhere.
- Aww!

593
00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:04.875
What's the matter? Can't you sleep?

594
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.375
Sleep also has a strange pattern.

595
00:43:09.166 --> 00:43:10.875
I couldn't sleep
because of stress before.

596
00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:13.000
Today. I can't sleep
because of my happiness.

597
00:43:13.375 --> 00:43:15.875
After so many struggles.
so many rejections and

598
00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:18.250
such a long time. finally!

599
00:43:20.375 --> 00:43:23.041
What kind of dream is which
doesn't require struggle?

600
00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:26.041
You were right. Pali.

601
00:43:26.625 --> 00:43:28.500
He must be someone special

602
00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:30.375
who would look at me
without any discrimination.

603
00:43:31.166 --> 00:43:34.000
Thank you so much. for
letting me meet that guy.

604
00:43:34.625 --> 00:43:37.041
Don't thank me. thank God.

605
00:43:37.416 --> 00:43:39.416
I only did my duty as a friend.

606
00:43:39.875 --> 00:43:41.500
my star Sara.

607
00:43:42.125 --> 00:43:44.375
Anyone who has a friend like you.

608
00:43:44.416 --> 00:43:45.750
is already a star.

609
00:43:46.291 --> 00:43:48.750
Oh! Shall we go and
sleep now. Ms Star?

610
00:43:49.541 --> 00:43:51.666
I heard that stars never sleep.

611
00:43:52.875 --> 00:43:55.125
Oh! As if!

612
00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:58.375
Let's go! Stars don't sleep! As if!

613
00:44:18.666 --> 00:44:20.500
How beautiful do
you want to make it?

614
00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:28.250
God has made her beautiful.

615
00:44:30.666 --> 00:44:33.000
I am just trying to copy him.

616
00:44:33.375 --> 00:44:35.375
Why don't you do my painting?

617
00:44:35.791 --> 00:44:36.916
I am also beautiful.

618
00:44:37.625 --> 00:44:39.791
I am more beautiful than her.

619
00:44:46.875 --> 00:44:47.666
Sit!

620
00:44:55.041 --> 00:44:57.375
Nature has made
everything really beautiful.

621
00:44:58.291 --> 00:45:00.750
And it has created humans
as the most beautiful creature.

622
00:45:03.375 --> 00:45:07.875
Its an old habbit of humans to destroy beautiful things.

623
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:11.500
Humans were supposed to be close to nature.

624
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:13.500
But they went away.

625
00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:15.916
If the curtains are removed.

626
00:45:16.666 --> 00:45:18.291
everyone is really beautiful.

627
00:45:19.875 --> 00:45:23.041
Anyhow. nature has not done
any discrimination against anyone.

628
00:45:25.041 --> 00:45:26.750
Then why do you discriminate?

629
00:45:28.291 --> 00:45:30.791
No matter how much beauty
is hidden behind curtain.

630
00:45:31.416 --> 00:45:32.666
it doesn't matter.

631
00:45:38.125 --> 00:45:42.750
if there are no curtains. it
becomes hard to express beauty.

632
00:45:50.375 --> 00:45:51.625
Greetings. Mom!

633
00:45:52.375 --> 00:45:53.625
Greetings. my dear!

634
00:45:54.375 --> 00:45:56.166
Mom. God has listened to me.

635
00:45:56.416 --> 00:45:58.250
In my desert of dreams.
I didn't get water.

636
00:45:58.625 --> 00:46:00.000
but whole ocean.

637
00:46:00.416 --> 00:46:03.125
I am on the verge of achieving my
dreams that I saw with open eyes.

638
00:46:03.291 --> 00:46:06.250
Sara. are you telling me truth?

639
00:46:07.166 --> 00:46:08.041
Thank god.

640
00:46:08.375 --> 00:46:10.541
Yes. Mom. Today.
my first movie's shoot...

641
00:46:10.916 --> 00:46:13.125
I mean. my work is going to start.

642
00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:15.250
I am really happy today.

643
00:46:16.041 --> 00:46:18.791
'I will go the shrine right away
and offer my prayers.'

644
00:46:19.875 --> 00:46:22.541
'I pray that God
makes my Sara happy.'

645
00:46:22.875 --> 00:46:26.000
Yes. Mom. Please pray that
God fulfils everyone's dreams.

646
00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:28.666
Mine too?

647
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:29.875
Mom!

648
00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:31.166
My dear.

649
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:33.000
I also have dreams.

650
00:46:33.166 --> 00:46:34.416
That you get married.

651
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.250
Get a husband.

652
00:46:36.375 --> 00:46:37.625
Have kids.

653
00:46:37.875 --> 00:46:39.125
Have your family.

654
00:46:39.375 --> 00:46:41.541
It will happen. Mom.
Everything will happen.

655
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.250
And everything will be really good.

656
00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:45.125
Should i call the middlemen?

657
00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:47.166
Shall I go ahead
and work first. Mom?

658
00:46:48.916 --> 00:46:51.541
Okay. I'll call you in the night.

659
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:53.375
Thn we'll talk.

660
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:55.375
Okay then! Goodbye!

661
00:46:56.125 --> 00:46:58.625
Okay. daughter. Goodbye!

662
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.500
Oh God. thanks a lot!

663
00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:10.500
Hello. are you ready?

664
00:47:10.916 --> 00:47:11.750
Hello. sir!

665
00:47:21.166 --> 00:47:23.416
First movie! First day!

666
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:24.791
How are you feeling?

667
00:47:25.916 --> 00:47:27.375
I can't explain. sir.

668
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000
Everything feels like a dream.

669
00:47:30.125 --> 00:47:33.625
Thank you so much. You have
come into my life as the God.

670
00:47:34.125 --> 00:47:36.291
I don't know how I should thank you.

671
00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:38.000
Like how you are supposed to do.

672
00:47:38.041 --> 00:47:39.791
do it like that.
- Thank you. sir.

673
00:47:40.125 --> 00:47:41.791
Thank you very much.

674
00:47:44.541 --> 00:47:46.000
It is not done like this.

675
00:47:46.541 --> 00:47:47.500
I didn't get you.

676
00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:54.291
You are not that innocent
that you don't understand.

677
00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:57.875
Come to me.

678
00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:00.625
Leave it now.

679
00:48:01.291 --> 00:48:02.625
Okay now.

680
00:48:06.291 --> 00:48:07.625
Hey. what's this?

681
00:48:08.791 --> 00:48:10.000
Look there. Who is he?

682
00:48:11.166 --> 00:48:12.125
Brother. what happened?

683
00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:15.041
Someone has focused
a laser on me. Check it.

684
00:48:15.541 --> 00:48:17.666
No. brother. Those are
just light adjustments.

685
00:48:18.041 --> 00:48:19.500
Light adjustments?
- Yes.

686
00:48:19.541 --> 00:48:22.125
Light adjustments. Move! Relax.

687
00:48:24.166 --> 00:48:25.125
Ready!

688
00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:27.750
Where did you find this fool from?

689
00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:37.166
What's happening with me today?

690
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.166
You are not that innocent
that you don't understand.

691
00:49:23.791 --> 00:49:25.750
'In the desert of dreams.
I didn't get water.'

692
00:49:26.041 --> 00:49:27.625
'but a companion.'

693
00:49:28.125 --> 00:49:30.875
'I am on the verge of achieving my
dreams that I saw with open eyes.'

694
00:49:30.916 --> 00:49:33.500
'Yes. Mom. Today.
my first movie's shoot...'

695
00:49:33.875 --> 00:49:35.875
'I mean. my work
is going to start.'

696
00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:37.916
'I am really happy today.'

697
00:49:51.875 --> 00:49:54.666
'I will go the shrine right away
and offer my prayers.'

698
00:49:55.875 --> 00:49:58.750
'I pray that God
makes my Sara happy.'

699
00:50:19.791 --> 00:50:22.625
'Yes. Mom. Today.
my first movie's shoot...'

700
00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:27.375
'In the desert of dreams.
I didn't get water but a companion.'

701
00:50:28.041 --> 00:50:30.125
'One day. I will work
in a bigger studio.'

702
00:50:30.166 --> 00:50:32.750
'that too in a lead role.'

703
00:50:32.875 --> 00:50:34.250
'...offer my prayers.'
- 'One day...'

704
00:50:34.291 --> 00:50:38.750
'I will work in
a bigger studio in a lead role.'

705
00:50:38.791 --> 00:50:42.541
'I got whole ocean. Yes. Mom!'

706
00:50:42.625 --> 00:50:45.375
'One day. I will work
in a bigger studio.'

707
00:51:04.041 --> 00:51:05.666
Simi. right?
- Yes.

708
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:07.541
We talked over the phone.
- Yes.

709
00:51:08.125 --> 00:51:09.875
Come! Have a seat.
- Thank you.

710
00:51:13.291 --> 00:51:14.166
What will you have?

711
00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:15.625
Coffee or...
- Coffee.

712
00:51:15.666 --> 00:51:16.666
Hot or cold?

713
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.500
Hot coffee.
- Okay.

714
00:51:18.791 --> 00:51:20.125
Two hot coffees. please!

715
00:51:22.125 --> 00:51:25.000
Are you an art lover?
Do you like paintings?

716
00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:28.500
No. Actually. yes.

717
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:29.791
What does that mean?

718
00:51:30.375 --> 00:51:32.750
I was not one. before
seeing your painting.

719
00:51:33.041 --> 00:51:35.625
That painter. made me an art lover.

720
00:51:37.416 --> 00:51:39.750
No one is ready to
pay me even 10.000.

721
00:51:40.166 --> 00:51:41.416
and you spent ten lacs.

722
00:51:42.041 --> 00:51:43.875
What did you see in that photo?

723
00:51:44.375 --> 00:51:45.750
I didn't see anything.

724
00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:47.875
that painter saw it.

725
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.375
I only liked that painting.

726
00:51:51.416 --> 00:51:54.000
I wanted to buy it.
but he didn't sell it.

727
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.875
In fact. I didn't get that painting
even after bidding ten lacs on it.

728
00:51:59.625 --> 00:52:01.375
Then I received a call from you.

729
00:52:01.791 --> 00:52:04.541
I thought that I didn't
get the girl's painting.

730
00:52:04.625 --> 00:52:06.250
at least I could meet the girl.

731
00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:09.750
Seriously? Did he reject ten lacs?

732
00:52:11.125 --> 00:52:13.000
Does this world have
these kind of people?

733
00:52:13.541 --> 00:52:15.750
I don't know about
others. but he is.

734
00:52:16.416 --> 00:52:17.916
He is a world in himself.

735
00:52:18.250 --> 00:52:19.625
a world of canvas.

736
00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:21.750
a lover of nature.

737
00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:23.666
a king of colours.

738
00:52:24.250 --> 00:52:25.166
You said it right.

739
00:52:26.125 --> 00:52:27.375
He must be someone like this.

740
00:52:28.125 --> 00:52:30.291
My colour. which was
rejected by everyone till now.

741
00:52:31.291 --> 00:52:34.041
his colours made that my beauty.

742
00:52:34.541 --> 00:52:36.291
I really want to meet him.

743
00:52:36.625 --> 00:52:38.791
I also want that both of
you meet each other.

744
00:52:38.875 --> 00:52:41.375
So that he can see all of you.

745
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:43.375
What do you mean by all of you?

746
00:52:43.875 --> 00:52:45.125
Actually. he...

747
00:52:45.166 --> 00:52:46.625
found half of your picture.

748
00:52:46.916 --> 00:52:49.500
But he completed
that with his own talent.

749
00:52:50.875 --> 00:52:54.500
Amazing! He didn't just
complete my picture.

750
00:52:54.875 --> 00:52:56.791
he completed my whole life.

751
00:52:59.250 --> 00:53:01.166
I am going tomorrow. Come with me.

752
00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:03.375
I will arrange a meeting.
- Yes. Definitely!

753
00:53:03.416 --> 00:53:04.625
Okay.

754
00:53:04.916 --> 00:53:08.541
I am staying in Hotel Marriott.
Be there. We will go together.

755
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.000
Why meet in a hotel?

756
00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:11.875
We have formed a relationship now

757
00:53:12.250 --> 00:53:14.041
and relatives stay at home.

758
00:53:14.125 --> 00:53:17.250
Not to a hotel. you are
coming with me to my home.

759
00:53:18.375 --> 00:53:19.666
No. It's okay.

760
00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:23.666
No. It's not okay. You are
coming with me. That's final.

761
00:53:24.291 --> 00:53:26.125
Do you stay with your family?

762
00:53:26.625 --> 00:53:29.666
No! No! I am staying
with my friend Pali.

763
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:31.625
Pali will be really
happy to meet you.

764
00:53:31.875 --> 00:53:32.541
Okay then.

765
00:53:42.375 --> 00:53:44.166
Your house is beautiful.

766
00:53:45.541 --> 00:53:46.750
Thank you!

767
00:53:47.625 --> 00:53:48.625
Thank you!

768
00:53:51.125 --> 00:53:53.875
She is Pali.
Pali. this is Simi.

769
00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:55.791
The girl with ten lacs?

770
00:53:58.916 --> 00:54:00.250
Yes. That's me.

771
00:54:00.541 --> 00:54:01.625
You didn't tell me that...

772
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:03.416
your friend is a doctor.

773
00:54:04.916 --> 00:54:07.125
Then she will be an
advocate tomorrow

774
00:54:07.416 --> 00:54:09.000
and a police officer
day after tomorrow.

775
00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:10.750
How so?

776
00:54:11.291 --> 00:54:12.750
Pali is also an actor.

777
00:54:12.875 --> 00:54:14.041
She shoots advertisements.

778
00:54:14.125 --> 00:54:16.000
New shoot. new outfit.

779
00:54:16.125 --> 00:54:17.875
Oh! That's good.

780
00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:22.000
You. actors. have an amazing life.

781
00:54:22.125 --> 00:54:25.000
You can live so many
lives in a single life.

782
00:54:26.041 --> 00:54:28.375
Wow! She talks beautifully.

783
00:54:30.125 --> 00:54:30.916
Hello!
- Hi!

784
00:54:31.041 --> 00:54:32.250
I am glad to meet you.

785
00:54:32.291 --> 00:54:35.166
Actually. It was a continious shoot. So I came to like this.

786
00:54:35.625 --> 00:54:36.625
Did you eat something?

787
00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:39.125
No. We were waiting for you?

788
00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:41.500
She makes such delicious food

789
00:54:41.541 --> 00:54:43.541
that your stomach will be full.
but not your heart.

790
00:54:44.416 --> 00:54:47.250
I don't know about her acting. but she is a good cook.

791
00:54:47.375 --> 00:54:48.500
Shut up!

792
00:54:50.375 --> 00:54:51.875
Let the jokes aside.

793
00:54:52.375 --> 00:54:54.500
she is also a great actor

794
00:54:54.875 --> 00:54:55.625
and a good human.

795
00:54:56.250 --> 00:55:01.125
There are very few people who
have faith on your dreams as much as you do.

796
00:55:01.541 --> 00:55:03.541
That's enough! You don't
need to sugarcoat anymore.

797
00:55:03.916 --> 00:55:06.291
I will get freshen up and then cook.
- Okay.

798
00:55:06.375 --> 00:55:07.750
You guys can carry
on your conversation.

799
00:55:07.875 --> 00:55:08.625
Okay.

800
00:55:09.250 --> 00:55:10.000
Let's go!

801
00:55:10.916 --> 00:55:12.625
In this industry.
most of the people

802
00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:14.416
wait to give a chance
to a new artist

803
00:55:14.791 --> 00:55:16.250
so that they can get a chance.

804
00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:19.625
I didn't give a chance to them
and didn't give me a chance.

805
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.625
After a lot of struggle.

806
00:55:21.666 --> 00:55:23.416
I thought that I was not
made for this industry.

807
00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:26.041
I was going to get
over with this when...

808
00:55:26.125 --> 00:55:27.375
Pali called me.

809
00:55:27.625 --> 00:55:29.250
Then she told me
about that picture.

810
00:55:29.291 --> 00:55:31.375
He didn't just make
a picture of mine.

811
00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:34.791
but he made the line
of life in my horoscope.

812
00:55:35.291 --> 00:55:37.500
I can never repay him.

813
00:55:43.375 --> 00:55:46.666
Sometimes. our conditions go...

814
00:55:46.916 --> 00:55:48.250
against our lives.

815
00:55:48.666 --> 00:55:51.375
And it's never easy
to fight with them.

816
00:55:53.375 --> 00:55:55.625
But we should not lose hope.

817
00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:59.916
We have to face
them. That's what life is.

818
00:56:01.416 --> 00:56:02.791
Pali always used to say that

819
00:56:03.416 --> 00:56:04.791
he must be someone special

820
00:56:05.250 --> 00:56:07.291
who would look at you
without any discrimination.

821
00:56:07.375 --> 00:56:08.166
Yes.

822
00:56:08.541 --> 00:56:10.000
You have said it right.

823
00:56:10.625 --> 00:56:13.250
He has really looked at you
without any discrimination.

824
00:56:14.666 --> 00:56:16.000
Shall I tell you the truth?

825
00:56:16.875 --> 00:56:19.375
After seeing the painting
that he has made of you.

826
00:56:19.416 --> 00:56:22.791
I find you more beautiful
than myself today.

827
00:56:26.416 --> 00:56:29.500
Girls. dinner is ready. Come fast!

828
00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:33.125
Shall we go? - Yes.
- Let's have dinner.

829
00:56:46.875 --> 00:56:47.666
Hello!

830
00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:49.375
Yes.

831
00:56:50.250 --> 00:56:52.791
Okay. Yes. I am a local.

832
00:56:53.916 --> 00:56:54.875
Right now?

833
00:56:55.875 --> 00:56:57.000
Okay. No problem!

834
00:56:57.625 --> 00:57:00.625
I am coming. Okay. Thank you. sir.

835
00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:03.375
What happened?

836
00:57:03.916 --> 00:57:05.291
Finally. I received the call

837
00:57:05.375 --> 00:57:07.500
for which I have been
waiting since so many years.

838
00:57:07.875 --> 00:57:09.375
It was a call from Rom.
the producer.

839
00:57:09.416 --> 00:57:11.291
He is asking me to
come and meet him.

840
00:57:11.625 --> 00:57:13.041
So I have to go.

841
00:57:15.125 --> 00:57:17.541
I will come to meet him by
tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

842
00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:20.125
Promise?
- Promise.

843
00:57:20.625 --> 00:57:22.000
But I have to go now.

844
00:57:22.666 --> 00:57:23.500
It's okay.

845
00:57:32.666 --> 00:57:34.875
Did you face any issues on the way?
- No. sir.

846
00:57:35.125 --> 00:57:36.500
The director will be
here within two minutes.

847
00:57:36.541 --> 00:57:39.125
See! He is here. Sir! - Yes.
- Sara.

848
00:57:40.125 --> 00:57:42.000
Oh! Photo girl!
- Yes.

849
00:57:44.125 --> 00:57:46.250
Three years back. I wrote a story.

850
00:57:47.041 --> 00:57:50.250
But I didn't find a
fresh face for that.

851
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.666
Then I saw your viral photo.

852
00:57:55.666 --> 00:57:58.750
And I thought that yes.
this can be that face.

853
00:57:59.625 --> 00:58:02.000
that face on which
eyes can get stuck.

854
00:58:03.875 --> 00:58:06.291
Congratulations! You
are doing my picture.

855
00:58:07.375 --> 00:58:08.375
that. too. as a lead role.

856
00:58:09.375 --> 00:58:10.541
Thank you. sir!

857
00:58:10.625 --> 00:58:13.875
Thank you so much!
- It's okay. You deserve this.

858
00:58:14.375 --> 00:58:15.666
Manu!
- Yes. sir!

859
00:58:15.750 --> 00:58:17.375
Take care of the paperwork.
- Yes. sir.

860
00:58:17.666 --> 00:58:20.250
Complete all the formalities.
- Definitely. sir. - Okay?

861
00:58:20.625 --> 00:58:21.500
Done. sir!

862
00:58:21.791 --> 00:58:23.166
I will see you then.
- Yes. sir.

863
00:58:23.875 --> 00:58:26.625
One more thing! Do
you have a boyfriend?

864
00:58:27.625 --> 00:58:28.500
No. sir!

865
00:58:28.625 --> 00:58:30.166
Mom.
- Yes.

866
00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:31.875
Will she accompany
you on the shooting?

867
00:58:31.916 --> 00:58:34.250
No. sir! She is a housewife.
She stays at home.

868
00:58:35.916 --> 00:58:37.625
Sign her. then.
- Okay. sir!

869
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.041
What happened?

870
00:58:47.125 --> 00:58:48.500
The movie is finalised.

871
00:58:48.625 --> 00:58:49.875
Really?
- Yes.

872
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.291
Wow!

873
00:58:55.875 --> 00:58:58.500
Here. Ms. Sara! Please sign it.

874
00:59:09.875 --> 00:59:11.750
Congratulations. Ms Sara!
- Thank you. Manu sir!

875
00:59:11.875 --> 00:59:12.625
Best of luck!

876
00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:22.125
You have to throw a party.
- Definitely.

877
00:59:23.375 --> 00:59:26.166
You can give him a party later.
For now. we have to leave on time.

878
00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:29.125
or else we will miss the bus and
have to pay high rent for the cab.

879
00:59:30.375 --> 00:59:31.625
What are you talking about?

880
00:59:32.375 --> 00:59:34.375
Her bus journey is over now.

881
00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:37.791
Since today. she
will enjoy a star life.

882
00:59:38.416 --> 00:59:40.250
Star life?

883
00:59:41.291 --> 00:59:43.750
After signing our
production house's movie.

884
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:44.750
an artist becomes a star.

885
00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:48.625
Now we will take
care of her every need.

886
00:59:49.375 --> 00:59:50.791
They only say that.

887
00:59:54.125 --> 00:59:56.875
Sara. this is your new car

888
00:59:58.375 --> 00:59:59.666
and a new flat

889
01:00:00.166 --> 01:00:01.541
from our production house.

890
01:00:02.541 --> 01:00:04.000
Thank you!
- Yes.

891
01:00:06.125 --> 01:00:07.041
They only say that.

892
01:00:10.541 --> 01:00:11.875
Come. Ms. Sara!

893
01:00:11.916 --> 01:00:14.250
From today onwards.
you will stay here.

894
01:00:14.625 --> 01:00:15.541
Wow!

895
01:00:16.541 --> 01:00:18.541
Such a beautiful house!
- Right!

896
01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:31.000
Sir!

897
01:00:34.291 --> 01:00:35.750
Look for something for me too.

898
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.500
I am also an artist.

899
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.500
I will put my blood
and sweat into it.

900
01:00:40.041 --> 01:00:41.166
They only say that.

901
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.500
I was just kidding about that.

902
01:00:45.541 --> 01:00:47.000
I am also doing the same.

903
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:48.750
kidding.

904
01:00:50.375 --> 01:00:51.625
Thank you so much. sir!

905
01:00:52.041 --> 01:00:55.125
Sorry! I am so happy that I have
no other words than thank you.

906
01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:56.375
It's okay. Ms Sara.

907
01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:57.875
You should take a rest for now.

908
01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.250
The car will be here to take you

909
01:01:00.291 --> 01:01:01.500
on the shoot tomorrow morning.
- Sure.

910
01:01:01.625 --> 01:01:02.750
See you there!
- See you!

911
01:01:02.791 --> 01:01:04.625
Sir. I will also come.

912
01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:06.125
They only say that.

913
01:01:14.541 --> 01:01:16.750
Finally. after three
years of searching.

914
01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:18.916
I found the face
that I was looking for.

915
01:01:19.791 --> 01:01:21.500
Now. my dream movie
will go on the floor.

916
01:01:21.916 --> 01:01:22.750
I am so happy.

917
01:01:23.666 --> 01:01:26.625
Thanks to all of you for
investing in the movie.

918
01:01:28.125 --> 01:01:31.416
We have only done this for
our friendship. Now it's your turn.

919
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.875
Take care that you don't make
us face a loss because of a dream.

920
01:01:34.916 --> 01:01:37.625
Listen to me! Dreams can be broken.

921
01:01:38.250 --> 01:01:39.625
but the money should not be lost.

922
01:01:39.666 --> 01:01:43.291
Brother. don't worry! We will
get the money on the table.

923
01:01:43.666 --> 01:01:45.166
Our story is really strong.

924
01:01:45.875 --> 01:01:47.625
Is it a comedy film?
- No.

925
01:01:48.875 --> 01:01:49.750
It's a period movie.

926
01:01:50.250 --> 01:01:53.000
A king's love with
a commoner's daughter.

927
01:01:53.666 --> 01:01:55.125
And then their separation.

928
01:01:55.375 --> 01:01:56.375
Union...

929
01:01:57.125 --> 01:01:59.625
and then tears.
- That's alright.

930
01:01:59.666 --> 01:02:02.500
Only a comedy film
gets the full money back.

931
01:02:03.166 --> 01:02:04.875
You can take care
of everything else.

932
01:02:05.250 --> 01:02:08.375
Brother. not every movie is
made to get the money back.

933
01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.250
I mean that getting the
money back is also important.

934
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.750
Actually. cinema is the
reflection of the society.

935
01:02:15.875 --> 01:02:16.250
Yes.

936
01:02:16.375 --> 01:02:17.666
Sometimes. we need
to show the society...

937
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:20.750
their face through a movie.

938
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000
It's your decision. But
think about it once more.

939
01:02:24.291 --> 01:02:27.250
Who even watches these kind of
movies? That too from the old times?

940
01:02:27.625 --> 01:02:30.250
People look for taste and fun.

941
01:02:30.375 --> 01:02:31.625
Entertainment.

942
01:02:32.125 --> 01:02:34.500
Vidya Balan has also
said the same thing.

943
01:02:34.625 --> 01:02:37.666
Entertainment!
Entertainment! Entertainment!

944
01:02:38.166 --> 01:02:40.625
Guys. comedy is not the
only way of entertainment.

945
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.416
A person who laughs all the
time is called crazy by the world.

946
01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:49.500
If a serious story
is told correctly.

947
01:02:50.125 --> 01:02:51.625
that's also a type
of entertainment.

948
01:02:51.916 --> 01:02:55.166
He is a director.
brother. and a writer too.

949
01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:57.500
He won't let us win with his words.

950
01:02:59.291 --> 01:03:01.000
Make whatever you want to make.

951
01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:03.875
We also want to see which
'Mughal-E-Azam' you will make.

952
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.625
Okay! Cheers!
- Cheers!

953
01:03:10.041 --> 01:03:11.125
Sara!

954
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Her name is Sara.

955
01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:19.375
Then?

956
01:03:20.416 --> 01:03:21.291
What then?

957
01:03:22.125 --> 01:03:23.625
I went to meet her.

958
01:03:23.666 --> 01:03:25.791
I also told her
everything about you.

959
01:03:26.375 --> 01:03:29.541
I thought that I should
make both of you meet.

960
01:03:30.375 --> 01:03:32.291
She promised to come.

961
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:35.375
but sadly. she didn't come
even after making the promise.

962
01:03:36.125 --> 01:03:37.416
But I never said that...

963
01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:39.000
I wanted to meet her.

964
01:03:39.541 --> 01:03:42.000
Why? Don't you love her?

965
01:03:42.666 --> 01:03:43.500
Love?

966
01:03:44.875 --> 01:03:47.250
I also love the moon and stars.

967
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:50.000
the Sun that glows
among those cold clouds.

968
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:54.291
and even this amusing rose.

969
01:03:55.666 --> 01:03:58.500
But it doesn't mean that they
have to come and meet me.

970
01:03:59.375 --> 01:04:01.750
It's not important for someone
to be near us to love them.

971
01:04:01.791 --> 01:04:04.250
By the way. it's been four days.

972
01:04:04.666 --> 01:04:06.125
She didn't give me a call.

973
01:04:06.166 --> 01:04:08.000
But she said to me that

974
01:04:08.375 --> 01:04:09.416
she would come.

975
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
See! I think that she
doesn't remember anything.

976
01:04:13.375 --> 01:04:14.875
And here you are.

977
01:04:15.250 --> 01:04:17.125
who has made her
reach to great heights.

978
01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:21.291
When you put a price on her.
she became a person of that world.

979
01:04:21.916 --> 01:04:23.875
But you were the
one who put a price.

980
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.500
But you made the picture.

981
01:04:26.791 --> 01:04:29.250
Yes. I did.

982
01:04:33.041 --> 01:04:35.250
But she is also a human.

983
01:04:36.041 --> 01:04:37.750
Not just the human.

984
01:04:38.125 --> 01:04:40.250
whoever gets a price here.

985
01:04:40.666 --> 01:04:43.750
they forget their old world
and enters a new world.

986
01:04:45.125 --> 01:04:47.000
The new one always
forgets about the old one.

987
01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:50.041
That's how it works.

988
01:05:52.875 --> 01:05:55.041
Finally. we are here.
- Yes.

989
01:05:56.916 --> 01:05:57.875
Yes mam?

990
01:05:59.250 --> 01:06:00.291
Two fresh juices.

991
01:06:00.375 --> 01:06:02.125
a subway for madam.

992
01:06:02.250 --> 01:06:05.125
After that. green tea
with fat-free cookies

993
01:06:05.166 --> 01:06:08.375
and we will have green salad
for lunch. that too without sauces.

994
01:06:08.625 --> 01:06:10.125
Go and get it.
- So much?

995
01:06:11.875 --> 01:06:13.250
They can do this much.

996
01:06:13.375 --> 01:06:15.625
Bigger the production.
the bigger the treatment.

997
01:06:15.875 --> 01:06:18.000
Don't worry! I know everything.

998
01:06:22.625 --> 01:06:23.750
Sara. Sukh!

999
01:06:24.250 --> 01:06:25.375
Sukh?

1000
01:06:25.416 --> 01:06:26.625
Superstar Sukh!

1001
01:06:26.875 --> 01:06:29.041
Wow! They have signed you with him.

1002
01:06:29.125 --> 01:06:31.166
No! He must not be him.

1003
01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:33.500
He must be someone
new. I am also new.

1004
01:06:36.291 --> 01:06:38.041
Oh God! I hope he
is the same. Sukh.

1005
01:06:40.666 --> 01:06:43.250
He is the same. - What?
- Look there.

1006
01:06:47.791 --> 01:06:50.916
He is coming towards us. - Yes.
- Sir. one minute.

1007
01:06:52.416 --> 01:06:55.000
Brother. she is Sara.
the actress with you.

1008
01:06:56.416 --> 01:06:57.500
Hello!
- Hello!

1009
01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:59.416
Your eyes are really beautiful.
- Thank you!

1010
01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:01.291
Hi. sir! I am Pali.

1011
01:07:01.875 --> 01:07:02.875
I am Sara's best friend.

1012
01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:04.416
Hello!

1013
01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:08.666
Oh God!
- Are you crazy? What are you doing?

1014
01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:26.500
"The moon and
stars talk about you."

1015
01:07:26.625 --> 01:07:32.125
"All of them want to
look at your innocence."

1016
01:07:32.250 --> 01:07:37.500
"The moon and
stars talk about you."

1017
01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:42.916
"All of them want to
look at your innocence."

1018
01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:48.500
"No one was before you.
and no one is after you."

1019
01:07:48.541 --> 01:07:51.500
"I have the wish to
meet you. darling."

1020
01:07:51.541 --> 01:07:54.000
"Like how king and queen meet."

1021
01:07:54.125 --> 01:07:57.250
"I have the wish to
meet you. darling."

1022
01:07:57.375 --> 01:08:00.000
"Like how king and queen meet."

1023
01:08:11.625 --> 01:08:17.250
"I fell in love with the
way your hair flew"

1024
01:08:17.291 --> 01:08:22.416
"I can die on the way with
which your eyelids closed."

1025
01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:28.166
"I fell in love with the
way your hair flew"

1026
01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:33.666
"I can die on the way with
which your eyelids closed."

1027
01:08:33.750 --> 01:08:38.791
"There is no comparison to
you. you are excellent. darling."

1028
01:08:38.875 --> 01:08:41.791
"I have the wish to
meet you. darling."

1029
01:08:41.875 --> 01:08:44.291
"Like how king and queen meet."

1030
01:08:44.375 --> 01:08:47.625
"I have the wish to
meet you. darling."

1031
01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:50.416
"Like how king and queen meet."

1032
01:08:56.541 --> 01:08:58.375
Hello. Yeah. Deep.

1033
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.375
I'm all right. What about you?

1034
01:09:02.166 --> 01:09:03.166
Of course.

1035
01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:05.875
Yes. we will meet soon.
I am coming soon.

1036
01:09:07.166 --> 01:09:09.416
Okay. bye. Take care.

1037
01:09:16.375 --> 01:09:17.541
Simi dear.

1038
01:09:18.666 --> 01:09:20.500
when are you going back?

1039
01:09:20.875 --> 01:09:22.875
How many more days
are left for you to return?

1040
01:09:23.291 --> 01:09:24.916
I have to go next week. Mom.

1041
01:09:25.416 --> 01:09:28.500
But to be honest.
I do not feel like going at all.

1042
01:09:28.791 --> 01:09:29.875
I wish I could stay

1043
01:09:30.375 --> 01:09:32.750
right here with you.
- Aww. my baby!

1044
01:09:33.250 --> 01:09:35.291
What are Mom and
daughter discussing?

1045
01:09:35.375 --> 01:09:37.125
Tell me something too.

1046
01:09:37.625 --> 01:09:40.500
It's nothing. Simi was saying

1047
01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.291
she does not feel like going at all.

1048
01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:48.416
Honey. even we don't want you to go.

1049
01:09:49.875 --> 01:09:52.375
We. too. want you to stay
with us as much as possible.

1050
01:09:53.625 --> 01:09:55.375
But this time. your father's love

1051
01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:57.250
will stop you. right?
- Why?

1052
01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:59.416
What about Mom's love?
- Oh!

1053
01:10:00.125 --> 01:10:02.625
What did I say? You always look
for reasons to fight.

1054
01:10:02.666 --> 01:10:06.000
Am I looking for reasons?
You need a chance to fight with me.

1055
01:10:06.125 --> 01:10:08.875
When did I fight with you?
- What were you doing just now?

1056
01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.375
Stop it now. Simi is right here.

1057
01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:13.000
You are always
talking about yourself.

1058
01:10:13.125 --> 01:10:14.541
You always look for my fault.

1059
01:10:14.625 --> 01:10:17.000
As if you never did anything.

1060
01:10:17.041 --> 01:10:18.500
Come on now. Enough.

1061
01:10:35.416 --> 01:10:37.541
Wow! Wonderful!

1062
01:10:38.375 --> 01:10:39.291
Amazing!

1063
01:10:40.791 --> 01:10:42.500
Wow. very good!

1064
01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Good job. Sukh.

1065
01:10:44.250 --> 01:10:45.041
Congrats!

1066
01:10:45.416 --> 01:10:48.250
Congrats. - Congratulations!
- To you too.

1067
01:10:48.250 --> 01:10:49.125
To you too.

1068
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.250
Wow! Amazing scene!

1069
01:10:54.125 --> 01:10:55.291
Amazing job.

1070
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:57.000
It was so good.

1071
01:10:58.041 --> 01:11:00.166
Amazing work!
I did such an amazing job!

1072
01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:04.000
Of course. - I mean.
our team. you. even madam too.

1073
01:11:04.375 --> 01:11:07.291
Director. our movie
is a sure shot hit.

1074
01:11:08.125 --> 01:11:09.750
You just get the money out

1075
01:11:09.875 --> 01:11:12.291
of the producer for promotions.
- Of course.

1076
01:11:12.375 --> 01:11:15.291
The movie is really good. Sir.
It's beautiful.

1077
01:11:15.375 --> 01:11:18.000
Our hard work paid off.

1078
01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Sir. - Hmm?
- Our poster is out now.

1079
01:11:21.416 --> 01:11:22.250
Look at this.

1080
01:11:23.541 --> 01:11:24.500
Yeah. it's good.

1081
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.416
Come on. man.
Try something else too.

1082
01:11:27.875 --> 01:11:29.000
It's still the same thing.

1083
01:11:29.041 --> 01:11:30.791
Sir. it's already the 4th poster.

1084
01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:32.500
What is it. Sir?

1085
01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:34.500
No problem.
- Actually.

1086
01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:36.125
the way our movie is.

1087
01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.750
it is not visible in the poster.

1088
01:11:38.875 --> 01:11:40.250
Yeah. sure.

1089
01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.666
I look so good in this. right?

1090
01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:44.666
I mean. we look so good.

1091
01:11:44.916 --> 01:11:48.625
Sir. why are you worried?
Our film is already a hit.

1092
01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:51.625
Even the poster is great!
- Of course.

1093
01:11:52.250 --> 01:11:55.041
Yeah. it's good.
But it could have been better.

1094
01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:58.125
Actually. the poster
is the first impression

1095
01:11:58.250 --> 01:12:00.000
of the film.
- Hmm.

1096
01:12:00.666 --> 01:12:02.500
Sara.
- Yes?

1097
01:12:03.250 --> 01:12:06.250
Who made that picture of you?

1098
01:12:06.666 --> 01:12:07.916
That picture?
- Yes.

1099
01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:09.916
It was a painter.

1100
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.250
Manu. - Yes. Sir?
- Call that painter.

1101
01:12:12.291 --> 01:12:14.750
Okay. Sir. - Tell him that
I want to meet him. - Sure. Sir.

1102
01:12:14.875 --> 01:12:15.916
Miss Sara.

1103
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.166
give me his number.

1104
01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:18.500
I will talk to him.

1105
01:12:19.375 --> 01:12:21.375
Okay. Sir. I'll talk to him
and give you an update.

1106
01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:22.250
Sukh. shall we?

1107
01:12:22.375 --> 01:12:23.750
We have to meet
the music director too.

1108
01:12:23.791 --> 01:12:25.000
Okay.
- Sure.

1109
01:13:22.625 --> 01:13:25.291
Hey. stand up. Don't warm
the bench for no reason.

1110
01:13:26.166 --> 01:13:27.750
Uh... Greetings.

1111
01:13:28.125 --> 01:13:29.166
Tea?

1112
01:13:29.791 --> 01:13:31.750
No. I don't want tea today.

1113
01:13:32.625 --> 01:13:34.750
What is it? Is everything all right?

1114
01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:38.500
Okay. tell me something.

1115
01:13:39.166 --> 01:13:41.500
When you want to tell
your heart to someone.

1116
01:13:42.125 --> 01:13:43.875
then what is the right time?

1117
01:13:45.666 --> 01:13:48.000
When the very thought
of this comes to the heart.

1118
01:13:48.375 --> 01:13:49.625
that is the right time.

1119
01:13:50.625 --> 01:13:53.125
But why are you telling me...

1120
01:13:57.125 --> 01:13:59.000
When it's the right time.

1121
01:13:59.125 --> 01:14:01.250
As they say. good luck!

1122
01:14:12.375 --> 01:14:15.791
Two colours together make
a new colour. don't they?

1123
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:18.625
Yeah.

1124
01:14:20.791 --> 01:14:22.875
These new colours bring freshness.

1125
01:14:27.625 --> 01:14:28.916
Would you like to have something?

1126
01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:32.666
Yes. An answer.

1127
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:35.375
An answer to my hope.

1128
01:14:36.125 --> 01:14:39.791
See. now I have also
started talking like you.

1129
01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:43.791
I didn't get you.

1130
01:14:44.250 --> 01:14:46.000
Even I don't know

1131
01:14:46.416 --> 01:14:50.500
when this happened and how.
All I know now

1132
01:14:51.125 --> 01:14:52.125
is that it happened.

1133
01:14:53.666 --> 01:14:56.416
What happened?
- You tell me something.

1134
01:14:57.250 --> 01:15:00.000
I feel the wind nowadays.

1135
01:15:00.875 --> 01:15:03.166
Everything around me is colourful.

1136
01:15:03.666 --> 01:15:07.250
I admonish myself and forbid myself.

1137
01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:10.125
You still don't understand?

1138
01:15:11.125 --> 01:15:13.166
No.
- Silly.

1139
01:15:14.541 --> 01:15:15.500
Well. tell me.

1140
01:15:16.125 --> 01:15:18.250
what do you do with your colours?

1141
01:15:18.791 --> 01:15:19.625
Love.

1142
01:15:21.416 --> 01:15:22.625
Simi.

1143
01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:47.125
Hi.

1144
01:15:48.291 --> 01:15:51.000
I am Sara. I'm sorry
I'm a little late.

1145
01:15:51.791 --> 01:15:55.166
The day Simi told me about you.
I was about to come to meet you.

1146
01:15:56.125 --> 01:15:59.166
Then my work started.
That too because of you.

1147
01:16:00.125 --> 01:16:01.750
I was busy with that only.

1148
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:04.625
Then as soon as I got time.
I came to meet you.

1149
01:16:05.291 --> 01:16:08.750
Thank you for getting me off the
ground to the heights of the sky.

1150
01:16:11.375 --> 01:16:12.791
What? Didn't you recognise her?

1151
01:16:13.291 --> 01:16:17.750
She is the one whose beauty you
have brought to the whole world.

1152
01:16:21.166 --> 01:16:22.000
No.

1153
01:16:22.791 --> 01:16:23.625
it's not her.

1154
01:16:24.250 --> 01:16:25.916
Not her. What do you mean?

1155
01:16:27.375 --> 01:16:30.750
The picture I had received
didn't want anything from me.

1156
01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:32.500
I just got it.

1157
01:16:33.375 --> 01:16:35.000
But the one who has come
to meet me today

1158
01:16:35.250 --> 01:16:37.166
has come for some reason.

1159
01:16:38.916 --> 01:16:41.375
Very good! You were right. Simi.

1160
01:16:41.916 --> 01:16:43.375
He reads faces very well.

1161
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.250
Yes. I am here for a reason.

1162
01:16:46.875 --> 01:16:49.375
But if my need is connected
with you. so what is my fault?

1163
01:16:49.875 --> 01:16:52.041
As my dream is being fulfilled
because of you.

1164
01:16:52.541 --> 01:16:54.416
it should not remain incomplete
because of you.

1165
01:16:54.791 --> 01:16:56.750
That's why I'm here
to take you with me.

1166
01:16:56.791 --> 01:16:58.791
You have to do one
more painting of me.

1167
01:16:59.041 --> 01:16:59.875
One more?

1168
01:17:00.375 --> 01:17:04.250
The director says that the poster
for the film will be made

1169
01:17:04.250 --> 01:17:06.000
by the same painter
who made my painting.

1170
01:17:07.041 --> 01:17:09.416
You will get good money for it.

1171
01:17:15.875 --> 01:17:17.125
Thank you.

1172
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:19.541
I don't need money.

1173
01:17:20.625 --> 01:17:23.750
Forgive me. but I can't go with you.

1174
01:17:37.666 --> 01:17:39.166
When a small-town girl

1175
01:17:40.291 --> 01:17:44.625
comes out of her house
with big dreams.

1176
01:17:45.625 --> 01:17:48.125
everyone rejects her
because of her complexion.

1177
01:17:49.125 --> 01:17:52.041
But she still sticks to her dream.

1178
01:17:53.875 --> 01:17:54.625
Then one day.

1179
01:17:55.541 --> 01:17:58.666
someone painted her picture
and took her to her destination.

1180
01:18:00.791 --> 01:18:05.125
Because of you. I am standing
a step from my destination.

1181
01:18:06.250 --> 01:18:08.500
If you don't take me up
by holding my hand.

1182
01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:11.250
then this time.
I will fall in such a way

1183
01:18:11.291 --> 01:18:12.750
that I will not be able to survive.

1184
01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:15.166
I will really die.

1185
01:18:17.375 --> 01:18:20.041
If that's what you had to do.
then why did you save my life?

1186
01:18:21.166 --> 01:18:22.625
Why did you paint my picture?

1187
01:18:30.250 --> 01:18:32.041
Sara is absolutely right.

1188
01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:34.250
You had saved her life.

1189
01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:38.250
Now you must go
to save her dreams too.

1190
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:46.166
Sara loves her art as passionately
as you love your art.

1191
01:18:47.125 --> 01:18:48.125
Don't you think

1192
01:18:49.125 --> 01:18:53.125
that an artist should
help another artist?

1193
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:57.000
After all. this is what
nature teaches us.

1194
01:19:21.166 --> 01:19:22.750
Cheers!

1195
01:19:26.375 --> 01:19:29.125
I think our movie will bring
a big change to the cinema.

1196
01:19:30.375 --> 01:19:32.375
People have seen
a lot of innocuous films.

1197
01:19:33.625 --> 01:19:35.375
Sensitive cinema is needed now.

1198
01:19:35.625 --> 01:19:36.541
Like art.

1199
01:19:36.875 --> 01:19:37.750
Like passion.

1200
01:19:37.875 --> 01:19:40.166
You know...
- I still can't digest it.

1201
01:19:40.750 --> 01:19:43.125
A good thing is rarely liked
by our people.

1202
01:19:43.125 --> 01:19:44.875
You should add some
comedy to the movie.

1203
01:19:45.125 --> 01:19:48.125
Believe me. you should try
Harman Cheema in your movie.

1204
01:19:50.750 --> 01:19:52.625
He will wreak havoc. Havoc!

1205
01:20:00.166 --> 01:20:02.916
Hello. Sir. He is Mr. Painter.

1206
01:20:03.291 --> 01:20:04.500
Welcome.

1207
01:20:05.125 --> 01:20:07.500
We are so lucky to have you here.

1208
01:20:08.041 --> 01:20:08.875
Thank you.

1209
01:20:09.250 --> 01:20:11.041
Sara must have told you that

1210
01:20:11.125 --> 01:20:13.250
we have made a very good movie.

1211
01:20:13.625 --> 01:20:15.625
So I want you to also
be a part of this film

1212
01:20:15.666 --> 01:20:17.000
and make such a poster

1213
01:20:17.625 --> 01:20:21.125
of our actress. which is
even better than before.

1214
01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.125
Every artist presents
his new work a little better

1215
01:20:27.625 --> 01:20:29.875
than his previous work.

1216
01:20:29.916 --> 01:20:33.000
But sometimes people understand.
and sometimes. they don't.

1217
01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:35.250
Wow! Wonderful!

1218
01:20:35.541 --> 01:20:36.666
Now we have got the right person.

1219
01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:39.666
Hmm. - I am sure
you will do great this time too.

1220
01:20:40.375 --> 01:20:42.500
They are the producers of our film.

1221
01:20:42.541 --> 01:20:44.125
And. Sir. he's that painter.

1222
01:20:44.416 --> 01:20:46.375
Now he will make a new poster
for our film.

1223
01:20:46.625 --> 01:20:48.291
Get ready for the poster first.

1224
01:20:48.666 --> 01:20:49.916
Come on. Painter.

1225
01:20:50.375 --> 01:20:51.750
sit here. Join us.

1226
01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:53.625
Make a peg for the guy.

1227
01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:55.625
Forgive me

1228
01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.250
I don't drink.
- Manu.

1229
01:20:57.666 --> 01:20:59.625
Room.
- Got it. Sir.

1230
01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:03.250
Come. Sir. Let me
show you your room.

1231
01:21:03.291 --> 01:21:04.791
Have some rest.

1232
01:21:07.416 --> 01:21:09.750
Got it? I just need to get the feel.

1233
01:21:10.250 --> 01:21:11.625
I think it would be perfect.

1234
01:21:12.541 --> 01:21:13.750
Rest. I will...

1235
01:21:13.791 --> 01:21:17.125
Manu. - Yes. Sir?
- Call Sara. Tell her to sit here.

1236
01:21:17.375 --> 01:21:19.625
Sure. Sir. She is getting ready.
She'll be here.

1237
01:21:19.916 --> 01:21:22.375
There's no need for her to be here.
- Inspiration.

1238
01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.250
I think if she is in here.

1239
01:21:24.625 --> 01:21:27.375
then you'll get some help.
- No. Sir.

1240
01:21:28.166 --> 01:21:29.791
I made it without
even seeing her before.

1241
01:21:30.625 --> 01:21:32.000
Anyway.

1242
01:21:32.625 --> 01:21:34.250
I have heard the story of the movie.

1243
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:37.500
Now all I have to do
is tell your story

1244
01:21:38.291 --> 01:21:39.875
in my colours.
- Oh my!

1245
01:21:40.375 --> 01:21:43.250
Wonderful!
This is called confidence.

1246
01:21:43.541 --> 01:21:44.375
Manu.

1247
01:21:44.875 --> 01:21:46.625
learn from him.
- Sure. Sir. Of course.

1248
01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.375
Okay. No problem.

1249
01:21:48.791 --> 01:21:50.166
Whatever you feel comfortable with.

1250
01:21:50.666 --> 01:21:53.375
Now we will meet only when the
poster is complete. Okay? - Sure.

1251
01:22:11.125 --> 01:22:17.375
"I swear to God.
I will sing your song"

1252
01:22:17.416 --> 01:22:23.750
"just like the twinkling
of stars in the dark."

1253
01:22:27.125 --> 01:22:33.666
"Even the half-moon
shines so gracefully."

1254
01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:39.500
"So imagine what the
full moon would feel like."

1255
01:22:42.916 --> 01:22:50.375
"Happiness has entered my heart."

1256
01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:57.875
"Like heaven on earth."

1257
01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:06.500
"Like heaven on earth."

1258
01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:23.666
"Convoys of fortune stopped
at your door."

1259
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:29.875
"All the complaints that
were there with life are gone."

1260
01:23:33.416 --> 01:23:36.500
"Somewhere there is sunshine.
Somewhere there is shade."

1261
01:23:36.541 --> 01:23:39.541
"Somewhere there is peace.
Somewhere there is noise."

1262
01:23:39.625 --> 01:23:47.250
"but beyond this.
the reality is something else."

1263
01:23:49.291 --> 01:23:56.375
"Somehow. I got connected
to the light."

1264
01:23:56.416 --> 01:24:03.875
"Like heaven on earth."

1265
01:24:03.875 --> 01:24:11.000
"Like heaven on earth."

1266
01:25:09.250 --> 01:25:10.250
What are you looking at?

1267
01:25:15.166 --> 01:25:16.250
Nothing. just

1268
01:25:17.875 --> 01:25:19.041
looking at the moon.

1269
01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.166
The seeker also found
spots in the moon.

1270
01:25:24.875 --> 01:25:26.125
and a lover gave it

1271
01:25:27.375 --> 01:25:29.500
the status of a lover.

1272
01:25:31.041 --> 01:25:33.875
It is up to the beholder
whether he sees a lover

1273
01:25:34.791 --> 01:25:35.625
or spots.

1274
01:25:39.375 --> 01:25:40.625
Thank you so much

1275
01:25:40.875 --> 01:25:44.250
that you came here on my request.
I owe you.

1276
01:25:45.541 --> 01:25:47.250
There is nothing like that.

1277
01:25:48.750 --> 01:25:51.500
Wherever God decides for a person.

1278
01:25:53.291 --> 01:25:54.875
he has to go there.

1279
01:25:56.166 --> 01:25:58.041
Nobody does anybody a favour.

1280
01:26:01.625 --> 01:26:03.875
Everyone's life has its
own different journey.

1281
01:26:06.041 --> 01:26:07.541
If not a favour.
think of it as help.

1282
01:26:08.791 --> 01:26:12.000
But I will never forget
what you did for me.

1283
01:26:12.791 --> 01:26:14.916
It's human nature to forget.

1284
01:26:15.541 --> 01:26:16.625
Well.

1285
01:26:17.541 --> 01:26:21.000
I'm glad to be of use to you.

1286
01:26:21.875 --> 01:26:25.166
And I'm lucky you painted
my picture a second time.

1287
01:26:36.916 --> 01:26:39.875
Wow! Very good! Excellent!

1288
01:26:41.041 --> 01:26:45.125
Sir. you are not a painter
but a magician. A magician.

1289
01:26:45.750 --> 01:26:47.625
A magician of colours. Ah!

1290
01:26:50.166 --> 01:26:51.791
I have seen many artists.

1291
01:26:52.416 --> 01:26:55.250
but I have not seen the soul
in anyone's art.

1292
01:26:55.916 --> 01:26:58.000
Put life into the picture.
- Absolutely.

1293
01:26:58.041 --> 01:26:59.625
The picture looks so alive.

1294
01:27:01.166 --> 01:27:03.250
Bro. meet me.

1295
01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.375
We will make more paintings.

1296
01:27:06.875 --> 01:27:08.625
Manu.
- Yes. Sir?

1297
01:27:08.875 --> 01:27:11.125
Prepare for the screening party.
- Sure. Sir.

1298
01:27:11.541 --> 01:27:13.250
We will reveal this poster there.

1299
01:27:13.291 --> 01:27:14.125
Hmm.
- Sure. Sir.

1300
01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:17.166
Sir. you must come to the party.
- Okay.

1301
01:27:17.250 --> 01:27:19.875
Sara. - Yes?
- It's your duty to bring him.

1302
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:20.916
Okay?
- Okay.

1303
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Sukh. shall we?

1304
01:27:23.041 --> 01:27:23.875
Good luck. bro.

1305
01:27:37.041 --> 01:27:39.166
Come on. Bring me some fritters.

1306
01:27:39.916 --> 01:27:40.916
Have a seat.

1307
01:27:42.541 --> 01:27:44.125
Here's your tea.

1308
01:27:44.625 --> 01:27:46.875
and here are your fritters.

1309
01:27:47.791 --> 01:27:50.041
Mr. Sidhu.

1310
01:27:51.875 --> 01:27:54.000
There are many in the market.

1311
01:27:54.041 --> 01:27:56.416
Not everyone is like your friend.

1312
01:28:01.916 --> 01:28:03.125
It's closed. right?

1313
01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:06.750
I told you that this is
not the way of business.

1314
01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:09.416
Everything I say comes true.

1315
01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:11.625
See. I closed his shop.

1316
01:28:11.875 --> 01:28:13.500
Give it back.

1317
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.500
Movie people have
taken your painter.

1318
01:28:18.916 --> 01:28:21.500
He is working with big actors
and actresses.

1319
01:28:21.791 --> 01:28:23.500
Like people have fans.

1320
01:28:23.541 --> 01:28:25.875
my Painter friend also has fans.

1321
01:28:28.041 --> 01:28:29.750
Movie guys?
- Yeah.

1322
01:28:29.791 --> 01:28:32.916
That's why the shop is closed.
See. he is so famous now.

1323
01:28:33.250 --> 01:28:34.291
You can come here too.

1324
01:28:34.375 --> 01:28:36.625
I will get one or two
paintings made for you too.

1325
01:28:36.666 --> 01:28:38.041
Come on now. Leave.

1326
01:28:38.375 --> 01:28:39.500
Hey. bro.
- Yeah.

1327
01:28:40.375 --> 01:28:41.916
Tell your painter

1328
01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.666
to introduce me to Neeru Bajwa.

1329
01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.375
I want to see

1330
01:28:45.416 --> 01:28:48.500
if she is really that beautiful
or if it's all a camera trick.

1331
01:28:48.916 --> 01:28:51.541
You can think of it as a trick.

1332
01:28:51.625 --> 01:28:54.500
Get lost! Wants to meet Neeru Bajwa.

1333
01:28:54.791 --> 01:28:56.500
I will take black paint
from the painter

1334
01:28:56.541 --> 01:28:57.875
and paint it on your name.

1335
01:28:58.875 --> 01:29:02.250
They have taken the painter
with them. not you.

1336
01:29:02.291 --> 01:29:04.416
Why are you acting so smart?

1337
01:29:05.041 --> 01:29:06.875
You have to make tea anyway.

1338
01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.666
Good for nothing.
- Get lost!

1339
01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:10.750
If you come back now.

1340
01:29:10.875 --> 01:29:12.500
I will poison your dumplings.

1341
01:29:12.625 --> 01:29:14.250
Trying to make fun of me.

1342
01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:18.666
Do your work.

1343
01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:50.125
What is the hurry to leave?

1344
01:29:50.416 --> 01:29:52.291
At least stay till the party.

1345
01:29:53.125 --> 01:29:54.000
No.

1346
01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:57.041
now that my job is done.

1347
01:29:58.750 --> 01:29:59.791
I think I should leave.

1348
01:30:00.250 --> 01:30:02.125
My house. my shop.

1349
01:30:02.625 --> 01:30:03.791
my love.

1350
01:30:06.541 --> 01:30:08.250
everyone must be waiting for me.

1351
01:30:10.125 --> 01:30:11.875
Everything would be
incomplete without me.

1352
01:30:13.375 --> 01:30:17.750
House can be built here as well
as shop. What's so special in there?

1353
01:30:18.166 --> 01:30:20.416
The real appreciation
of art is here.

1354
01:30:21.250 --> 01:30:23.875
You'll see. you will
become famous overnight.

1355
01:30:26.625 --> 01:30:28.041
Those who become famous overnight

1356
01:30:29.041 --> 01:30:30.791
also. become anonymous overnight.

1357
01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:34.250
The way fame comes.

1358
01:30:34.541 --> 01:30:36.041
the way it goes.

1359
01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:38.791
All you need is art.
appreciation can

1360
01:30:40.166 --> 01:30:42.375
find you even in the
deepest corner of the Earth.

1361
01:30:43.250 --> 01:30:45.250
It sounds good to talk
about all these things.

1362
01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:47.416
but today's truth is that

1363
01:30:47.916 --> 01:30:49.916
it takes money even to breathe.

1364
01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:56.291
The will of the breather

1365
01:30:57.166 --> 01:30:58.916
and a little bit of air
is enough to breathe.

1366
01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:02.375
The world that gives money and fame

1367
01:31:03.125 --> 01:31:05.166
makes you sit on
the top in one moment

1368
01:31:05.875 --> 01:31:08.125
and can bring you down on
the ground in the next moment.

1369
01:31:08.625 --> 01:31:13.166
Anyways. I suffocate being
around greedy and mean people.

1370
01:31:13.875 --> 01:31:15.875
I am very happy with what
I am and wherever I am.

1371
01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:18.541
Goodbye.

1372
01:31:46.250 --> 01:31:48.541
Hey. why are you upset?

1373
01:31:49.875 --> 01:31:51.875
Now even your
dreams are coming true.

1374
01:31:52.625 --> 01:31:55.291
Come on. Your movie
is getting released.

1375
01:31:55.625 --> 01:31:56.875
What else do you want?

1376
01:31:57.291 --> 01:31:58.875
He did something to me.

1377
01:31:59.875 --> 01:32:04.000
He... He touched my soul.
- Hmm?

1378
01:32:19.291 --> 01:32:22.291
He hasn't come yet
but will come soon.

1379
01:32:23.916 --> 01:32:26.250
Do the villagers ever come back
after going to the city?

1380
01:32:27.625 --> 01:32:30.625
Well. I'm going back to Canada.

1381
01:32:33.125 --> 01:32:34.500
Give it to him.

1382
01:32:34.916 --> 01:32:37.000
You should have met him
before leaving.

1383
01:32:39.125 --> 01:32:40.750
I had come to meet.

1384
01:32:41.291 --> 01:32:42.625
but I think

1385
01:32:44.166 --> 01:32:48.125
the guys who were meant to
be together have already met.

1386
01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:14.625
"My love. I agree that you
are the master of colours."

1387
01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:24.250
"Tell me where the love
of the capricious is sold."

1388
01:33:24.750 --> 01:33:32.791
"You took my breath away.
leaving my soul empty."

1389
01:33:33.916 --> 01:33:41.750
"Do you like the colour
of a broken heart?"

1390
01:33:42.125 --> 01:33:50.875
"My love. I agree that you
are the master of colours."

1391
01:33:51.000 --> 01:34:00.125
"Tell me where the love
of the capricious is sold."

1392
01:34:14.791 --> 01:34:24.125
"Why couldn't my colours fill you?"

1393
01:34:24.166 --> 01:34:32.541
"What are you lost in that
our issues are not resolved?"

1394
01:34:33.291 --> 01:34:42.250
"Why couldn't my colours fill you?"

1395
01:34:42.375 --> 01:34:50.291
"What are you lost in that
our issues are not resolved?"

1396
01:34:50.666 --> 01:34:52.750
"You are stonehearted."

1397
01:34:52.791 --> 01:34:59.500
"You didn't understand my pain.
Why are you colourless?"

1398
01:34:59.750 --> 01:35:08.750
"There is no colour in your heart.
You are selfish."

1399
01:35:09.875 --> 01:35:14.416
"Now. even you will
not see the colour"

1400
01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:17.875
"of the sorrow of being alone."

1401
01:35:17.916 --> 01:35:26.625
"My love. I agree that you
are the master of colours."

1402
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:37.125
"Tell me where the love
of the capricious is sold."

1403
01:35:41.875 --> 01:35:43.500
Hey... Painter.

1404
01:35:43.750 --> 01:35:44.916
Hey. handle this.

1405
01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:50.500
Hey. Painter.

1406
01:35:52.541 --> 01:35:53.750
You are back!

1407
01:35:54.250 --> 01:35:55.125
How are you?

1408
01:35:55.875 --> 01:35:58.666
To be honest. without your words.
even my dumplings

1409
01:35:58.875 --> 01:36:00.250
seemed tasteless.

1410
01:36:00.916 --> 01:36:01.875
Really!

1411
01:36:02.416 --> 01:36:03.500
Simi was here.

1412
01:36:04.166 --> 01:36:06.666
She gave it to you before leaving.

1413
01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:13.541
Let me bring tea for you.

1414
01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:21.000
'I'm going back'

1415
01:36:21.666 --> 01:36:24.541
'empty-handed.
Actually. it was my fault.'

1416
01:36:25.250 --> 01:36:27.875
'A picture made by whom
did not come in my share.'

1417
01:36:28.625 --> 01:36:30.625
'I asked God for him only.'

1418
01:36:31.041 --> 01:36:33.541
'And. yeah. no one hangs
the curtains themselves.'

1419
01:36:34.166 --> 01:36:35.750
'People hang them.'

1420
01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.750
'But if someone is there
to see beyond the curtains.'

1421
01:36:39.125 --> 01:36:40.875
'then the curtains
also. get removed.'

1422
01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:43.750
'I didn't get my love.'

1423
01:36:44.875 --> 01:36:47.250
'but you be happy with your love.'

1424
01:36:47.625 --> 01:36:50.416
Greetings. everyone.

1425
01:36:50.666 --> 01:36:54.875
I am your filmy friend. and you are
watching my channel Filmy Akhbaar.

1426
01:36:55.875 --> 01:36:58.125
Don't forget to like
and share the video.

1427
01:36:58.666 --> 01:37:00.250
So. friends. let's start

1428
01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:03.666
the review of this week's
released the film Rajkumar.

1429
01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.666
The film stars superstar Sukh.
in the lead role.

1430
01:37:07.375 --> 01:37:10.500
and a new girl has
been launched with him.

1431
01:37:10.791 --> 01:37:12.625
Her name is Sara.

1432
01:37:13.750 --> 01:37:15.500
Sank the whole fleet.

1433
01:37:15.541 --> 01:37:19.041
Actually. the whole problem
of this film starts from here.

1434
01:37:19.416 --> 01:37:22.875
How can you take a new girl
with such a big artist?

1435
01:37:23.875 --> 01:37:28.500
Look. the pairing of a star actress
with a star. the actor looks good.

1436
01:37:29.625 --> 01:37:31.125
Well. leave it.

1437
01:37:31.666 --> 01:37:34.416
Debbie Singh directed this film.

1438
01:37:35.125 --> 01:37:37.916
I don't know how he would
have convinced his bait...

1439
01:37:38.125 --> 01:37:41.250
I mean. the producer
to make this story.

1440
01:37:41.375 --> 01:37:43.666
If we talk about
the story of this film.

1441
01:37:44.250 --> 01:37:46.875
then the story is of the era
of Kings and Queens.

1442
01:37:47.541 --> 01:37:49.041
Who watches such movies?

1443
01:37:49.750 --> 01:37:53.250
I had to watch it
because I have to review.

1444
01:37:54.041 --> 01:37:56.291
But. friends. you
have no compulsion.

1445
01:37:56.625 --> 01:37:59.625
It's up to you whether you
want to see this movie or not.

1446
01:37:59.916 --> 01:38:03.041
But this movie is a complete flop.

1447
01:38:04.250 --> 01:38:06.250
Flop!

1448
01:38:08.625 --> 01:38:09.625
Look at this.

1449
01:38:10.125 --> 01:38:11.666
Those who do not have any work.

1450
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:13.666
they start their own channel.

1451
01:38:14.291 --> 01:38:16.375
It is easy to make fun of films.

1452
01:38:16.416 --> 01:38:18.875
Let them make films themselves.
They would know the reality.

1453
01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.750
Why are you listening
to his rubbish?

1454
01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:24.000
They stamp us as a flop in moments.

1455
01:38:24.875 --> 01:38:28.041
On the one hand. these people
talk about promoting new talent.

1456
01:38:28.791 --> 01:38:30.750
and on the other hand.
they push them back

1457
01:38:31.166 --> 01:38:33.291
because they are new.

1458
01:38:35.416 --> 01:38:36.916
They are so double-faced. Paali.

1459
01:38:37.125 --> 01:38:39.625
Obviously. Hit and flop is
just a tag. Life moves on.

1460
01:38:39.666 --> 01:38:42.166
After one hit.
people forget everything.

1461
01:38:48.666 --> 01:38:50.916
In the process of fulfilling
your dream. we lost so much.

1462
01:38:51.125 --> 01:38:52.916
Film line worms are made of rubber.

1463
01:38:53.541 --> 01:38:54.375
They don't die.

1464
01:38:55.500 --> 01:38:56.875
Some sink. and some swim.

1465
01:38:57.666 --> 01:39:00.875
You. directors. keep bait
for your selfishness.

1466
01:39:01.791 --> 01:39:04.750
Then you kill that bait by
giving it the name of the producer.

1467
01:39:05.625 --> 01:39:07.750
That too mercilessly.

1468
01:39:08.625 --> 01:39:10.250
Are you getting my point?

1469
01:39:10.666 --> 01:39:13.125
This is the problem
with the directors and writers.

1470
01:39:13.916 --> 01:39:15.500
There was nothing wrong
with my film.

1471
01:39:16.625 --> 01:39:18.000
People's reaction is wrong.

1472
01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:20.291
My film is 100 times better

1473
01:39:20.791 --> 01:39:22.625
than the films that
are becoming hits.

1474
01:39:22.666 --> 01:39:24.500
You. yourself. are
saying that those are hits.

1475
01:39:27.166 --> 01:39:30.625
The public has nothing
to do with art and nature.

1476
01:39:31.250 --> 01:39:32.875
They just want to laugh.

1477
01:39:33.750 --> 01:39:35.666
Even if you have
to tickle them yourself.

1478
01:39:36.500 --> 01:39:37.625
This is how you do business.

1479
01:39:38.500 --> 01:39:41.541
Sir. I need an OTP
that's on your phone.

1480
01:39:42.791 --> 01:39:43.875
What OTP?

1481
01:39:43.916 --> 01:39:45.750
Sir. rent and maintenance

1482
01:39:45.875 --> 01:39:48.041
of Miss Sara's flat.

1483
01:39:48.125 --> 01:39:49.375
One lakh rupees only.

1484
01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:50.916
Stop it with your 'only'.

1485
01:39:51.625 --> 01:39:53.041
I won't pay for anyone now.

1486
01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:54.625
Throw her out.

1487
01:39:55.041 --> 01:39:56.375
She is an actress of a flop film.

1488
01:39:57.416 --> 01:39:59.875
Get her out of here.
- Sir. listen... - Hello.

1489
01:40:00.375 --> 01:40:01.375
don't say anything.

1490
01:40:01.791 --> 01:40:03.250
Quiet. Shh!

1491
01:40:03.750 --> 01:40:04.750
Quiet!

1492
01:40:06.250 --> 01:40:08.791
Got your OTP? Leave.

1493
01:40:13.125 --> 01:40:15.791
How dare you? How can you do this?

1494
01:40:16.375 --> 01:40:20.041
Where should we go now?
- Sorry. Mam.

1495
01:40:20.375 --> 01:40:23.166
But the Producer has asked
to vacate the flat immediately.

1496
01:40:24.291 --> 01:40:26.375
Sara... Sara. did you see?

1497
01:40:26.666 --> 01:40:30.000
Their film flopped. so they
are throwing us out of here.

1498
01:40:30.125 --> 01:40:31.000
Really sorry. Mam.

1499
01:40:31.375 --> 01:40:32.750
Even I feel bad for you.

1500
01:40:33.416 --> 01:40:35.291
But you have to leave now.

1501
01:40:35.916 --> 01:40:37.750
You just... Just shut up!

1502
01:40:38.125 --> 01:40:39.666
I'm helpless too. Mam.

1503
01:41:03.541 --> 01:41:05.375
Miss Sara. the car
is waiting outside.

1504
01:41:05.750 --> 01:41:09.375
Tell me wherever you want
to go. The driver will drop you off.

1505
01:41:13.416 --> 01:41:14.500
No. thanks.

1506
01:41:18.875 --> 01:41:20.416
Such a cheap producer he was.

1507
01:41:20.875 --> 01:41:23.041
We have to be upfront from now on.

1508
01:41:23.125 --> 01:41:24.541
Either don't provide accommodation

1509
01:41:24.666 --> 01:41:26.916
and if you do. then don't
take it away. This is not done.

1510
01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.166
This won't be needed now.

1511
01:41:31.041 --> 01:41:32.500
I won't do any more movies.

1512
01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.125
This was the last one.

1513
01:41:35.250 --> 01:41:36.750
I don't want to be an actress.

1514
01:41:37.375 --> 01:41:38.416
I am happy being Sara.

1515
01:41:39.125 --> 01:41:40.041
Keep your spirits up.

1516
01:41:40.375 --> 01:41:42.375
Everyone stands up
after fumbling like this.

1517
01:41:43.250 --> 01:41:44.250
That's it. Paali.

1518
01:41:44.916 --> 01:41:46.250
I saw what I wanted to see.

1519
01:41:47.916 --> 01:41:49.125
My mother was right

1520
01:41:50.125 --> 01:41:53.250
that my dreams were nothing but
an illusion of water in the desert.

1521
01:41:54.541 --> 01:41:56.000
He was also right.

1522
01:41:56.666 --> 01:41:59.500
The world makes you sit
on the top in one moment

1523
01:42:00.375 --> 01:42:01.666
and can bring you down

1524
01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
on the ground in the next moment.

1525
01:42:05.791 --> 01:42:07.416
What the hell are you talking about?

1526
01:42:08.041 --> 01:42:10.291
And why are we sitting
here at the bus stand?

1527
01:42:11.125 --> 01:42:12.916
I have a friend.
Let's go to her place.

1528
01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.125
Come on. Let's go.
- No. Paali.

1529
01:42:15.166 --> 01:42:16.000
You go.

1530
01:42:17.625 --> 01:42:19.166
I know where I want to go.

1531
01:42:30.625 --> 01:42:31.750
You were right.

1532
01:42:32.625 --> 01:42:34.791
About people. about
being famous. about fame.

1533
01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:37.375
you were right about everything.

1534
01:42:39.375 --> 01:42:40.750
This world doesn't give

1535
01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:43.125
as much as it makes you lose.

1536
01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:45.250
I have realised

1537
01:42:45.875 --> 01:42:47.541
that dreaming is not a bad thing.

1538
01:42:48.750 --> 01:42:51.000
but leaving everything
to chase them blindly

1539
01:42:51.916 --> 01:42:53.250
is also not the right thing.

1540
01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:55.500
What happened?

1541
01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:00.625
I am in love with you.

1542
01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:06.750
Just like the way
you love your colours.

1543
01:43:08.250 --> 01:43:11.500
I want to leave my world
and be a part of your world.

1544
01:43:12.791 --> 01:43:16.625
I want to spend my whole life
with these pictures of yours.

1545
01:43:18.625 --> 01:43:20.666
I will stay wherever you say.
Anyway. you want.

1546
01:43:24.125 --> 01:43:25.875
I... I love you.

1547
01:43:28.500 --> 01:43:29.875
I love you too.

1548
01:43:32.125 --> 01:43:33.541
But as a human being.

1549
01:43:34.375 --> 01:43:36.750
As a part of that vast nature.

1550
01:43:39.750 --> 01:43:41.125
To be honest.

1551
01:43:46.916 --> 01:43:49.000
I am in love only with my art.

1552
01:43:51.250 --> 01:43:52.625
With my colours

1553
01:43:54.375 --> 01:43:56.000
and with these paintings of mine.

1554
01:43:56.666 --> 01:43:59.416
Love happens only once.

1555
01:44:00.250 --> 01:44:02.000
If I love someone else.

1556
01:44:02.875 --> 01:44:04.750
it will not be loyalty with love.

1557
01:44:07.875 --> 01:44:10.041
But I'm glad you came here today.

1558
01:44:11.375 --> 01:44:14.500
You have no curtains today.

1559
01:44:15.250 --> 01:44:18.375
Now you look like the one I painted.

1560
01:44:23.875 --> 01:44:28.125
I feel my colours. got coloured in her colours.

1561
01:44:29.750 --> 01:44:30.750
Or maybe.

1562
01:44:31.750 --> 01:44:33.875
I'm just starting to see
beyond the colours.

1563
01:44:58.875 --> 01:45:05.541
"I am your nature.
and you are my God."

1564
01:45:06.041 --> 01:45:13.000
"Like heaven on earth."

1565
01:45:13.291 --> 01:45:20.416
"Like heaven on earth."

1566
01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:28.166
"Like heaven on earth."
