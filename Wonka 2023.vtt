everywhere.

but you’re welcome
to take a look if you want.

180
00:09:57.047 --> 00:09:59.049
I’ll just give it a once-over.

181
00:10:06.826 --> 00:10:09.664
Well. that all seems
to be in order.

182
00:10:09.664 --> 00:10:10.698
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

183
00:10:10.698 --> 00:10:12.667
Hello.
- Ah!

184
00:10:12.667 --> 00:10:14.471
Then welcome to Scrubitt’s.

185
00:10:16.033 --> 00:10:19.410
There you are. Mr. Wonka.
The entrepreneurial suite.

186
00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:22.512
There’s your four-poster.
and your sink plus soap.

187
00:10:22.512 --> 00:10:24.041
and there’s a little mint
on your pillow.

188
00:10:24.041 --> 00:10:25.680
Fantastic.

189
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.847
What kind people.

190
00:10:35.558 --> 00:10:37.725
Noodle!

191
00:10:38.187 --> 00:10:39.760
Oh. Noodle!

192
00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:40.860
Yes. Mrs. Scrubitt?

193
00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:42.697
I’ve been lookin’ for you.

194
00:10:42.697 --> 00:10:43.731
What do you want?

195
00:10:43.731 --> 00:10:45.766
I wanna teach you a lesson.
you miserable little bookworm.

196
00:10:45.766 --> 00:10:46.701
What did I do wrong?

197
00:10:46.701 --> 00:10:47.966
You know what you did.
you brat.

198
00:10:47.966 --> 00:10:49.935
- Stop squirming!
- What? No. please.

199
00:10:50.738 --> 00:10:52.608
You ever
interfere in my business again.

200
00:10:52.608 --> 00:10:55.578
and you’ll be
in this coop all week.
Do you understand?

201
00:10:55.578 --> 00:10:58.680
Yes. Mrs. Scrubitt.
Sorry. Mrs. Scrubitt.

202
00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:02.178
I should think so. too.

203
00:11:30.239 --> 00:11:33.077
Here we go. Mamma.

204
00:11:38.621 --> 00:11:42.625
Ladies and gentlemen
of the Galeries Gourmet.

205
00:11:42.625 --> 00:11:44.088
my name is Willy Wonka.

206
00:11:44.088 --> 00:11:47.498
and I have come to show you
a marvelous morsel.

207
00:11:47.498 --> 00:11:48.928
an incredible edible.

208
00:11:48.928 --> 00:11:51.634
an unbeatable eatable.

209
00:11:51.634 --> 00:11:53.834
the likes of which
this world has never seen.

210
00:11:53.834 --> 00:11:56.639
So quiet up and listen down.

211
00:11:56.639 --> 00:11:58.839
No. scratch that. reverse it.

212
00:11:58.839 --> 00:12:00.742
I give to you

213
00:12:00.742 --> 00:12:01.578

-  Bravo!

240
00:13:20.217 --> 00:13:21.119
Thank you.

241
00:13:21.119 --> 00:13:23.990
- Miss Bon-Bon?
- Yes. Mr. Slugworth.

242
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.958
Call the police.

243
00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.223
Very good. sir.

244
00:13:26.223 --> 00:13:28.797
Well. who wants to try one?

245
00:13:28.797 --> 00:13:31.096
-  Me. please!
-  I will.

246
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.770
Mr. Slugworth. sir.
-  ’Scuse me.

247
00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:35.837
Mr. Fickelgruber.

248
00:13:35.837 --> 00:13:38.235
- And Mr. Prodnose.

249
00:13:38.235 --> 00:13:39.071
What an honor.

250
00:13:39.071 --> 00:13:40.336
Ever since
I was a little boy...

251
00:13:40.336 --> 00:13:42.613
- That is quite a handshake.

252
00:13:42.613 --> 00:13:45.044
It’s a business handshake.
Mr. Wonka.

253
00:13:45.044 --> 00:13:47.849
Lets people know
I mean business.

254
00:13:47.849 --> 00:13:48.949
- Huh...
- Now. come along.

255
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:54.119
Let’s try one of these
so-called Hoverchocs.

256
00:14:03.293 --> 00:14:04.734
Ooh.

257
00:14:04.734 --> 00:14:06.868
It’s not just chocolate.
is it?

258
00:14:06.868 --> 00:14:08.265
There’s...

259
00:14:08.265 --> 00:14:09.970
- marshmallow.
-  That’s right.

260
00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:12.401
Harvested from
the mallow marshes of Peru.

261
00:14:12.401 --> 00:14:14.403
And caramel.

262
00:14:14.403 --> 00:14:16.372
But... but it’s...
-  Salted.

263
00:14:16.372 --> 00:14:19.408
With the bittersweet tears
of a Russian clown.

264
00:14:19.408 --> 00:14:22.081
-  And is that...

265
00:14:22.081 --> 00:14:23.819
Surely not?

266
00:14:23.885 --> 00:14:24.347
Cherry?

267
00:14:24.347 --> 00:14:26.151
Cherry-picked by
the pick of the cherry pickers

268
00:14:26.151 --> 00:14:28.120
from the Imperial Gardens
in Japan.

269
00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.387
- Well. Mr. Wonka.

270
00:14:31.387 --> 00:14:33.895
I’ve been in this business
a very long time.

271
00:14:33.895 --> 00:14:34.896
and I can safely say

272
00:14:34.896 --> 00:14:38.130
that of all the chocolate
I have ever tasted.

273
00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:40.198
this is without doubt

274
00:14:40.198 --> 00:14:43.366
the absolute 100% worst.

275
00:14:43.366 --> 00:14:44.400
- Whoo!

276
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.006
There we have it.
ladies and gentlemen.

277
00:14:46.006 --> 00:14:48.239
An endorsement from Mr...

278
00:14:48.239 --> 00:14:49.042
Wait. The worst?

279
00:14:49.042 --> 00:14:52.012
We three
are the fiercest of rivals.

280
00:14:52.012 --> 00:14:53.376
and yet we agree on one thing.

281
00:14:53.376 --> 00:14:55.983
A good chocolate
should be simple.

282
00:14:55.983 --> 00:14:57.380
Plain. Uncomplicated.

283
00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.054
Whereas this. with all
its bells and whistles...

284
00:15:01.054 --> 00:15:03.452
Well. it’s just...

285
00:15:03.452 --> 00:15:05.190
Weird.

286
00:15:05.388 --> 00:15:06.389
That’s a shame.

287
00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:09.964
- If you thought
the chocolate was weird.

288
00:15:09.964 --> 00:15:12.769
you’re gonna hate
what happens next.

289
00:15:12.835 --> 00:15:14.232
- Hmm?

290
00:15:14.232 --> 00:15:16.069
What’s happening?
Whoa. what’s going on?

291
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:18.071
That’s the hoverfly.

292
00:15:18.071 --> 00:15:19.875
It’s broken
out of its cocoon.

293
00:15:19.875 --> 00:15:22.009
It’s flapping its wings
like billy-oh.

294
00:15:23.109 --> 00:15:25.914
My hair!
You mean a fly is doing this?

295
00:15:25.914 --> 00:15:27.047
Yes. But don’t worry.

296
00:15:27.047 --> 00:15:29.148
It’ll be completely unharmed.
- Oh. thank you.

297
00:15:29.148 --> 00:15:31.117
In about 20 minutes.
it’ll get tired

298
00:15:31.117 --> 00:15:33.086
and exit through your rear.

299
00:15:33.086 --> 00:15:33.889
You what?

300
00:15:33.889 --> 00:15:35.990
He means we’re going to
fart them out of our botties!

301
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:37.761
Yes. I know what he meant.

302
00:15:37.761 --> 00:15:39.224
You’re off your rocker. Wonka!

303
00:15:39.224 --> 00:15:40.159
Who in their right mind

304
00:15:40.159 --> 00:15:41.765
wants a chocolate
that makes you fly?

305
00:15:41.765 --> 00:15:43.459
Well. let’s find out.
shall we?

306
00:15:43.459 --> 00:15:44.834
Who’s for a Hoverchoc?

307
00:15:44.834 --> 00:15:47.133
-  I want one!

308
00:15:47.133 --> 00:15:50.037
One sovereign. please.
Thank you.

309
00:15:50.037 --> 00:15:51.302
Thank you very much.

310
00:15:51.302 --> 00:15:53.744
One sovereign.
Thank you. madam.

311
00:15:53.744 --> 00:15:55.141
Enjoy your flight.

312
00:15:55.911 --> 00:15:58.881
Look. I’m flying!
I’m flying!

313
00:16:01.213 --> 00:16:03.754
How’s the view
up there?

314
00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:07.219
Not too high. darling!

315
00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.255
Beat it. kid.

316
00:16:10.255 --> 00:16:12.323
All right. folks.
Nothin’ to see here.

317
00:16:12.323 --> 00:16:16.899
Just a small group of people
defyin’ the laws of gravity.

318
00:16:16.899 --> 00:16:17.966
- Yeah.
- Hook ’em. boys.

319
00:16:17.966 --> 00:16:19.528
That’s the Hoverchoc.
sir. That’s the point.

320
00:16:19.528 --> 00:16:22.938
I’m afraid
we’ve had some complaints
about you. sir.

321
00:16:22.938 --> 00:16:23.873
Complaints?

322
00:16:23.873 --> 00:16:25.941
That you’re disrupting
the trade of other businesses.

323
00:16:25.941 --> 00:16:28.438
I’m regrettably obliged
to move you on

324
00:16:28.438 --> 00:16:29.945
and to confiscate

325
00:16:29.945 --> 00:16:31.078
- your earnings.

326
00:16:31.078 --> 00:16:32.882
Hey!
What are you doing?
-  No!

327
00:16:32.882 --> 00:16:34.378
Don’t worry.
it’s going to a good cause.

328
00:16:34.378 --> 00:16:36.413
-  Get off.
- Sick kids. or something.

329
00:16:36.413 --> 00:16:38.052
Sorry. sir. Rules is rules.

330
00:16:38.052 --> 00:16:39.482
Cheeky devil. you!
Come here!

331
00:16:39.482 --> 00:16:42.826
Could you at least
leave me a sovereign?

332
00:16:42.826 --> 00:16:45.125
I need to pay for my room.

333
00:16:47.292 --> 00:16:50.526
- Here.

334
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:52.935
Thank you.

335
00:16:55.465 --> 00:16:58.072
Evening. Mr. Wonka.

336
00:16:58.369 --> 00:16:59.172
How’d it go?

337
00:16:59.172 --> 00:17:00.437
Not quite as well
as I’d hoped.

338
00:17:00.437 --> 00:17:03.880
Oh. shame. Well. I’m afraid
we do have to settle up now.

339
00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.081
Well. thankfully.
the room’s taken care of.

340
00:17:07.081 --> 00:17:08.918
Believe we said a sovereign.

341
00:17:08.918 --> 00:17:09.820
For the room. yes.

342
00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:12.350
But you have incurred
a few extras

343
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:16.156
during the course of your
residency with ourselves.

344
00:17:16.156 --> 00:17:19.126
- Have I?
- Yes. you have.

345
00:17:19.126 --> 00:17:22.426
There was that glass of gin
you had on arrival.

346
00:17:22.426 --> 00:17:23.592
and if I remember rightly.

347
00:17:23.592 --> 00:17:26.331
you warmed your cockles
by the fire.

348
00:17:26.331 --> 00:17:27.497
He did indeed. Mrs. Scrubitt.

349
00:17:27.497 --> 00:17:30.170
- Cockle-warming is extra. see?

350
00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.436
Used the stairs
to get to his room. and all.

351
00:17:32.436 --> 00:17:34.372
Oh. then
you’ve got your stair charge.

352
00:17:34.372 --> 00:17:37.881
and that is per step.
I’m afraid. Up and down.

353
00:17:37.881 --> 00:17:39.014
Now. tell me. Mr. Wonka.

354
00:17:39.014 --> 00:17:41.885
did you happen
to use the mini bar?

355
00:17:41.885 --> 00:17:43.018
There’s a minibar?

356
00:17:43.018 --> 00:17:44.250
Mini bar of soap.

357
00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:45.086
By the sink.

358
00:17:45.086 --> 00:17:46.956
Uh... I might have. briefly.
- Oh-ho!

359
00:17:46.956 --> 00:17:49.387
See? Even Bleacher knows
you never touch the mini bar.

360
00:17:49.387 --> 00:17:51.895
and he was raised in a ditch.

361
00:17:51.895 --> 00:17:53.226
Add in your mattress hire.

362
00:17:53.226 --> 00:17:55.327
your linen lease.
and your pillow penalty.

363
00:17:55.327 --> 00:17:57.494
and you are looking at...

364
00:17:57.494 --> 00:17:59.133
Ten thousand sovereigns.

365
00:17:59.133 --> 00:18:00.299
You gotta be kidding me?

366
00:18:00.299 --> 00:18:02.873
It’s all in the small print. dearie.

367
00:18:02.873 --> 00:18:04.567
I don’t have
10.000 sovereigns.

368
00:18:05.535 --> 00:18:07.306
Then we have a problem.
Mr. Wonka.

369
00:18:07.306 --> 00:18:08.571
You’re gonna
have to work it off

370
00:18:08.571 --> 00:18:10.881
in the Wash House. ain’t ya?

371
00:18:10.881 --> 00:18:12.212
At a sovereign a day.

372
00:18:12.212 --> 00:18:13.180
Ten thousand days is...

373
00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:14.445
Twenty-seven years.

374
00:18:14.445 --> 00:18:15.611
- Hey!
-  Four months.

375
00:18:15.611 --> 00:18:17.052
And 16 days.

376
00:18:22.618 --> 00:18:24.488
-  Ah.

377
00:18:24.488 --> 00:18:27.557
You must be
Mr. Wonka.
- Who are you?

378
00:18:27.557 --> 00:18:31.429
Abacus Crunch.
chartered accountant.

379
00:18:31.429 --> 00:18:32.463
At least. I was.

380
00:18:32.463 --> 00:18:34.300
- Now. uh...
- He runs the place.

381
00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:37.237
And you best do as he says.
or you’ll answer to me.

382
00:18:37.237 --> 00:18:39.041
Piper Benz. Plumber by trade.

383
00:18:39.041 --> 00:18:41.604
This is
Miss Lottie Bell.

384
00:18:41.604 --> 00:18:43.111
Hi.

385
00:18:43.111 --> 00:18:44.046
She don’t talk much.

386
00:18:44.046 --> 00:18:48.479
And I’m Larry Chucklesworth!

387
00:18:48.479 --> 00:18:49.414
Comedian.

388
00:18:49.414 --> 00:18:50.250
Hmm.

389
00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:52.219
So they got all of you. too.
did they?

390
00:18:52.219 --> 00:18:53.319
I’m afraid so.

391
00:18:53.319 --> 00:18:54.584
We each of us found ourselves

392
00:18:54.584 --> 00:18:56.025
in need of a cheap place
to stay.

393
00:18:56.025 --> 00:18:58.357
and neglected
to read the small print.

394
00:18:58.357 --> 00:19:02.658
One moment of stupidity.
followed by endless regret.

395
00:19:02.658 --> 00:19:06.629
Sounds like my third marriage.

396
00:19:06.695 --> 00:19:08.466
I’m sorry. I do that a lot.

397
00:19:08.466 --> 00:19:09.599
He does.
- A lot.

398
00:19:09.599 --> 00:19:11.568
I’ve only
been married once.

399
00:19:11.568 --> 00:19:12.635
and it didn’t work out.

400
00:19:12.635 --> 00:19:14.307
There’s gotta be
some way outta here.

401
00:19:14.307 --> 00:19:15.572
You don’t think
we’ve tried?

402
00:19:15.572 --> 00:19:18.047
There are bars on the window
and there’s a dog on the door.

403
00:19:18.047 --> 00:19:19.675
And even
if you could get out.

404
00:19:19.675 --> 00:19:20.951
that contract is watertight.

405
00:19:20.951 --> 00:19:24.383
If you’re not here
at roll call. Mrs. Scrubitt
will call the police.

406
00:19:24.383 --> 00:19:25.483
they’ll bring you right back.

407
00:19:25.483 --> 00:19:28.024
and she’ll charge you
a thousand
for the inconvenience.

408
00:19:28.684 --> 00:19:30.356
All right. everybody.
Back to work.

409
00:19:30.356 --> 00:19:31.555
- Come along. Mr. Wonka.

410
00:19:31.555 --> 00:19:34.591
- You come with me.

411
00:19:34.591 --> 00:19:38.166
You’re in here. On suds.

412
00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.304

436
00:20:58.279 --> 00:20:59.709

442
00:21:42.422 --> 00:21:45.161
Told you to read
the small print.

443
00:21:45.458 --> 00:21:47.658
Slight problem with that.

444
00:21:48.461 --> 00:21:50.199
You can’t read. can you?

445
00:21:50.199 --> 00:21:54.401
I focused my studies
almost exclusively
on chocolate.

446
00:21:54.401 --> 00:21:55.369
I see.

447
00:21:55.369 --> 00:21:58.240
For everything else.
I’ve relied on the kindness
of strangers.

448
00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:02.838
And look
where that’s got you.
The staff quarters.

449
00:22:03.179 --> 00:22:04.741
You’ve got a bed.

450
00:22:07.249 --> 00:22:09.119
You had a bed.

451
00:22:09.119 --> 00:22:13.288
Desk. and a wash basin/toilet.

452
00:22:13.288 --> 00:22:14.322
- Ugh.
- The water comes

453
00:22:14.322 --> 00:22:17.589
in two temperatures. Cold...

454
00:22:17.589 --> 00:22:19.525
...and colder.

455
00:22:20.262 --> 00:22:22.231
How much do you owe them?

456
00:22:22.231 --> 00:22:23.265
Ten thousand.

457
00:22:23.265 --> 00:22:25.729
Count yourself lucky.
I owe 30.

458
00:22:25.729 --> 00:22:27.599
What? How do you
owe them money?

459
00:22:27.599 --> 00:22:30.437
I thought they found you
down a laundry chute.

460
00:22:30.437 --> 00:22:31.306
Oh. they did.

461
00:22:31.306 --> 00:22:33.143
Took me in out of the goodness
of their hearts

462
00:22:33.143 --> 00:22:35.739
and charged me
for the privilege.

463
00:22:35.739 --> 00:22:36.773
What a pair of monsters.

464
00:22:36.773 --> 00:22:40.315
The greedy beat the needy
every time. Mr. Wonka.

465
00:22:40.315 --> 00:22:42.317
Guess it’s just
the way of the world.

466
00:22:42.317 --> 00:22:43.516
Oh. come on. Noodle.

467
00:22:43.516 --> 00:22:46.750
That’s just your
Orphan Syndrome talking.

468
00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:48.818
- My what?
- Your Orphan Syndrome.

469
00:22:48.818 --> 00:22:52.690
And we are not gonna
be eating any slops.

470
00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:54.230
What are you doing?

471
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:55.858
I’m making chocolate.
o’ course.

472
00:22:55.858 --> 00:22:56.892
How do you like it? Dark?

473
00:22:56.892 --> 00:23:00.203
White? Nutty?
Absolutely insane?

474
00:23:00.203 --> 00:23:01.402
I don’t know.

475
00:23:01.402 --> 00:23:03.833
I’ve never had any.

476
00:23:03.833 --> 00:23:06.902
You’ve never had chocolate?

477
00:23:06.902 --> 00:23:08.508
- No.
-  What?

478
00:23:08.508 --> 00:23:10.774
You’ve never had chocolate?

479
00:23:10.873 --> 00:23:11.775
Still no.

480
00:23:11.775 --> 00:23:14.646
Well. this is unbelievable.
I mean. this is outrageous.

481
00:23:14.646 --> 00:23:16.879
Well. lucky for you. Noodle.
I have a selection

482
00:23:16.879 --> 00:23:18.518
of the world’s
finest ingredients

483
00:23:18.518 --> 00:23:20.619
right here
in my travel factory.

484
00:23:26.229 --> 00:23:26.757
Whoa.

485
00:23:26.757 --> 00:23:29.430
Where to begin?
That’s the question.

486
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:30.662
I know!

487
00:23:30.662 --> 00:23:31.465
Silver Linings.

488
00:23:31.465 --> 00:23:34.633
Made of condensed
thunder clouds

489
00:23:34.765 --> 00:23:36.668
and liquid sunlight.

490
00:23:36.668 --> 00:23:39.308
Helps you see
that faint ray o’ hope

491
00:23:39.308 --> 00:23:41.442
beyond the shadow of despair.

492
00:23:41.442 --> 00:23:42.344
Just what we need.

493
00:23:42.344 --> 00:23:43.741
- wouldn’t you say?

494
00:23:43.741 --> 00:23:45.743
Did you always
wanna make chocolate?

495
00:23:45.743 --> 00:23:47.646
No.

496
00:23:47.646 --> 00:23:49.285
Back when I was your age.

497
00:23:49.285 --> 00:23:51.353
I wanted to be a magician.

498
00:23:51.353 --> 00:23:53.322
My mom was a cook.

499
00:23:53.322 --> 00:23:55.786
We lived on the river.
just the two of us.

500
00:23:55.786 --> 00:24:00.230
In a perfect little
world of our own.

501
00:24:00.989 --> 00:24:03.266
The way I remember it.
I used to spend

502
00:24:03.266 --> 00:24:04.729
every waking hour
trying to come up

503
00:24:04.729 --> 00:24:08.535
with some new trick
to impress my mom.

504
00:24:08.832 --> 00:24:10.570
Bravo!

505
00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:14.475
But the real magic
came from her.

506
00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:17.940
We didn’t have a lotta money.
but each week.

507
00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:19.876
she brought home
one cocoa bean.

508
00:24:19.876 --> 00:24:21.614
And by the time my birthday
came around.

509
00:24:21.614 --> 00:24:25.618
there was enough to make
a single bar o’ chocolate.

510
00:24:25.618 --> 00:24:28.918
But it wasn’t
just any old chocolate.

511
00:24:28.918 --> 00:24:30.689
Far from it.

512
00:24:30.689 --> 00:24:33.758
This has to be
the best chocolate
in the world.

513
00:24:33.758 --> 00:24:35.364
Oh.
don’t know about that.

514
00:24:35.364 --> 00:24:37.993
They say the very best
comes from a place

515
00:24:37.993 --> 00:24:39.698
called the Galeries Gourmet.

516
00:24:39.698 --> 00:24:43.339
Theirs can’t be any better
than yours. Mamma.

517
00:24:43.339 --> 00:24:44.637
It’s impossible.

518
00:24:44.637 --> 00:24:47.805
Well. as it so happens.

519
00:24:47.805 --> 00:24:49.411
I do know a little secret

520
00:24:49.411 --> 00:24:52.843
that even
those fancy-pants don’t.

521
00:24:53.349 --> 00:24:54.383
What is it?

522
00:24:54.383 --> 00:24:55.010
I’ll tell ya.

523
00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:59.421
When you’re older.
Now get to sleep.

524
00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:06.659
We should go. Amma.

525
00:25:06.659 --> 00:25:07.891
Where’s that. then?

526
00:25:07.891 --> 00:25:10.058
To the Galeries Gourmet.
- What?

527
00:25:10.058 --> 00:25:11.796
And start a shop?
- Yeah.

528
00:25:11.796 --> 00:25:14.700
With our name above the door
and everything.

529
00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:17.835
That’s a wonderful dream. honey.

530
00:25:17.901 --> 00:25:20.541
Is that all it is?

531
00:25:21.003 --> 00:25:23.379
Just a dream?

532
00:25:24.413 --> 00:25:25.909
Hey now.

533
00:25:27.482 --> 00:25:32.487
Every good thing in this world
started with a dream.

534
00:25:32.487 --> 00:25:33.950
So you hold on to yours.

535
00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:36.689
And when you do share
chocolate with the world.

536
00:25:36.689 --> 00:25:40.858
oh. I’ll be right there
beside ya.

537
00:25:40.858 --> 00:25:41.595
Promise?

538
00:25:41.595 --> 00:25:42.695
Do better than that.

539
00:25:42.695 --> 00:25:45.962
I pinkie promise.

540
00:25:47.601 --> 00:25:48.866
Now.

541
00:25:48.866 --> 00:25:50.505
sleep.

542
00:25:52.408 --> 00:25:55.840
So. what was it. Willy?

543
00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:57.842
What was the secret?

544
00:25:57.842 --> 00:26:00.482
I never found out.

545
00:26:00.812 --> 00:26:02.913
Soon after. she fell sick.

546
00:26:02.913 --> 00:26:08.424
And before I knew it.
all I had left
was her bar of chocolate.

547
00:26:12.021 --> 00:26:13.891
That’s why I’m here. Noodle.

548
00:26:13.891 --> 00:26:17.499
So I can feel the same way
I did back then.

549
00:26:17.499 --> 00:26:20.062
eating chocolate with her.

550
00:26:20.898 --> 00:26:21.833
What do you mean?

551
00:26:21.833 --> 00:26:24.869
My mom once promised
that when I share chocolate
with the world.

552
00:26:24.869 --> 00:26:27.102
she’d be right there
beside me.

553
00:26:28.411 --> 00:26:30.743
I know it sounds crazy.
but I always hoped

554
00:26:30.743 --> 00:26:33.141
she’d somehow
keep that promise.

555
00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:37.420
She might even
tell me her secret.

556
00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:45.120
Here. Try one.

557
00:27:02.808 --> 00:27:04.942
Wish you hadn’t done that.

558
00:27:04.942 --> 00:27:07.813
You don’t like it?
- No.

559
00:27:07.813 --> 00:27:11.047
I like it. It’s just...

560
00:27:11.179 --> 00:27:12.048
What?

561
00:27:12.048 --> 00:27:16.426
Now each day
I don’t have chocolate
will be a little harder.

562
00:27:16.426 --> 00:27:21.156
Then how would you like
to have all the chocolate
you can eat. every day.

563
00:27:21.156 --> 00:27:22.828
for the rest of your life?

564
00:27:22.828 --> 00:27:23.994
A lifetime supply?

565
00:27:23.994 --> 00:27:26.436
A lifetime supply.

566
00:27:26.436 --> 00:27:27.162
What would I have to do?

567
00:27:27.162 --> 00:27:28.999
Not much.
Just get me out of here.

568
00:27:28.999 --> 00:27:30.671
Are you crazy?
- Shh!

569
00:27:30.671 --> 00:27:32.607
It’s easy. I’ll get someone
to cover my shift.

570
00:27:32.607 --> 00:27:34.444
and you could smuggle me out
in your laundry cart.

571
00:27:34.444 --> 00:27:35.808
- But I...
- Just for a few hours. mind.

572
00:27:35.808 --> 00:27:37.744
No one will even know
I was gone.

573
00:27:37.744 --> 00:27:38.844
What’s the point of that?

574
00:27:38.844 --> 00:27:40.912
To sell chocolate. o’ course!
We’ll split the profits

575
00:27:40.912 --> 00:27:42.716
and pay off Mrs. Scrubitt
in no time.

576
00:27:42.716 --> 00:27:43.651
It’s a nice idea. Willy.

577
00:27:43.651 --> 00:27:45.752
- It’s a great idea.
- But it’ll never work.

578
00:27:45.752 --> 00:27:47.721
’Course it will.
Eat your chocolate.

579
00:27:47.721 --> 00:27:48.854
You don’t understand.

580
00:27:48.854 --> 00:27:51.824
Mrs. Scrubitt’s like a hawk.
She keeps her beady eye
on everything

581
00:27:51.824 --> 00:27:55.762
that comes in and out
of the Wash House except...

582
00:27:56.191 --> 00:27:57.797
Huh.

583
00:27:57.863 --> 00:27:59.535
What is it?

584
00:27:59.535 --> 00:28:00.998
No. it’s nothing.

585
00:28:00.998 --> 00:28:02.802
Oh. okay.

586
00:28:02.901 --> 00:28:03.572
Huh.

587
00:28:03.572 --> 00:28:04.837
Double-huh!
That’s not nothing.

588
00:28:04.837 --> 00:28:06.542
That’s the Silver Lining.
It’s given you an idea.

589
00:28:06.542 --> 00:28:09.039
Okay. So. the one time
she dropped her guard

590
00:28:09.039 --> 00:28:11.107
was when this aristocrat
came to the laundry.

591
00:28:11.107 --> 00:28:13.109
He was only
asking for directions.

592
00:28:13.109 --> 00:28:15.716
but she was all over him
like a rash.

593
00:28:15.716 --> 00:28:17.080
It was disgusting.

594
00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:17.982
That’s it. Noodle.

595
00:28:17.982 --> 00:28:19.621
All we have to do
is find an aristocrat

596
00:28:19.621 --> 00:28:21.953
and slip out
while she’s distracted.

597
00:28:21.953 --> 00:28:22.987
Yeah. but...

598
00:28:22.987 --> 00:28:26.562
where are we going
to find an aristocrat?

599
00:28:29.026 --> 00:28:30.093
Huh.

600
00:28:30.093 --> 00:28:31.699
Huh?

601
00:28:32.095 --> 00:28:33.030
Huh.

602
00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:33.866
A double-huh.

603
00:28:33.866 --> 00:28:35.230
Do you have
a pencil and paper?

604
00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:38.739
- Uh-huh.
- I got an idea.

605
00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:59.694
I’ve come
to make a confession.

606
00:29:01.564 --> 00:29:05.029
You sound great. fellas.
Keep it up.

607
00:29:08.802 --> 00:29:12.300
Forgive me. Father.
for I have sinned.

608
00:29:12.872 --> 00:29:17.811
I have had 150 of these
since my last confession.

609
00:29:19.274 --> 00:29:23.113
Temptation is very hard
to resist.

610
00:29:26.017 --> 00:29:27.656
Mmm.

611
00:29:27.656 --> 00:29:29.823
Send me down.

612
00:29:29.922 --> 00:29:33.563
- I’ll see you later.

613
00:29:37.831 --> 00:29:40.570
Good evening. Chief.

614
00:29:40.669 --> 00:29:41.736
They’re all waiting.

615
00:29:41.736 --> 00:29:43.804
Thank you very much.

616
00:29:44.739 --> 00:29:47.203
Good evening. gentlemen.
I’ve brought my invoice.

617
00:29:47.203 --> 00:29:51.845
One chocolatier moved on
for the usual fee.

618
00:29:51.845 --> 00:29:53.143
Oh.

619
00:29:53.143 --> 00:29:54.276
Here we go. baby.

620
00:29:54.276 --> 00:29:55.651
There’s the good stuff. Yeah.

621
00:29:55.651 --> 00:29:57.279
Tell me. Chief...
Mm-hmm?

622
00:29:57.279 --> 00:30:00.084
...how would you like
to earn a few more of those?

623
00:30:00.084 --> 00:30:01.118
Oh. I am listening.

624
00:30:01.118 --> 00:30:02.724
We think
that Mr. Wonka

625
00:30:02.724 --> 00:30:07.058
might require a little more
than simply moving on.

626
00:30:07.058 --> 00:30:09.027
- Oh.
-  He’s good.

627
00:30:09.027 --> 00:30:10.160
Too good.

628
00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:10.996
And what’s more.

629
00:30:10.996 --> 00:30:13.229
he only charges
a sovereign a chocolate.

630
00:30:13.229 --> 00:30:17.134
So anyone can afford them.
even the...

631
00:30:18.267 --> 00:30:19.741
You know. the...

632
00:30:19.741 --> 00:30:22.007
- The poor?
-  Oh. dear.

633
00:30:22.007 --> 00:30:25.043
I’ve just been
a little bit sick in my mouth.

634
00:30:25.043 --> 00:30:26.814
Could you please refrain
from mentioning

635
00:30:26.814 --> 00:30:28.244
that demographic
in my presence?

636
00:30:28.244 --> 00:30:30.147
He doesn’t like it
when people say "poor."

637
00:30:30.147 --> 00:30:31.918
-  Sorry. Felix.

638
00:30:31.918 --> 00:30:35.086
We want you to send
Wonka a message.

639
00:30:35.086 --> 00:30:36.692
Backed up by physical force.

640
00:30:36.692 --> 00:30:39.662
That if he attempts to sell
chocolate in this town again.

641
00:30:39.662 --> 00:30:43.699
he is liable to meet
with a little accident.

642
00:30:43.699 --> 00:30:45.965
In which he dies.

643
00:30:45.965 --> 00:30:47.362
Yeah. no. I...
I got that already.

644
00:30:47.362 --> 00:30:48.836
You don’t have
to keep saying it.

645
00:30:48.836 --> 00:30:50.970
I’m just making sure
we’re all on the same page.

646
00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:52.037
Well. no one’s on your page.

647
00:30:52.037 --> 00:30:54.006
What’s that supposed to mean?
Well. I know what it means...

648
00:30:54.006 --> 00:30:55.073
Actually. what does it mean?

649
00:30:55.073 --> 00:30:57.306
Gentlemen. please.

650
00:30:58.010 --> 00:30:59.979
So. what do you say. Chief?

651
00:30:59.979 --> 00:31:00.881
Do we have a deal?

652
00:31:00.881 --> 00:31:03.785
Well. listen. fellas.
I’m an officer of the law.

653
00:31:03.785 --> 00:31:08.317
I can’t just go around
roughin’ up your competition.

654
00:31:08.955 --> 00:31:10.660
I’m sorry.

655
00:31:10.891 --> 00:31:11.694
Well now. Chief.

656
00:31:13.795 --> 00:31:16.699
I can see that
you’re a man of integrity.

657
00:31:18.932 --> 00:31:19.834
Thank you.

658
00:31:19.834 --> 00:31:22.364

710
00:33:33.264 --> 00:33:33.935
Oh. wow.

711
00:33:33.935 --> 00:33:36.905
The unmistakable
sound of love.

712
00:33:36.971 --> 00:33:38.170
You what?

713
00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:40.337
Don’t tell me
you hadn’t noticed.

714
00:33:40.337 --> 00:33:41.107
What?

715
00:33:41.107 --> 00:33:43.076
She’s madly in love with you.

716
00:33:43.076 --> 00:33:44.880
Mrs. Scrubitt?

717
00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:45.980
Besotted.

718
00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.246
And why not? Look at you.

719
00:33:48.246 --> 00:33:49.214
Fine figure of a man.

720
00:33:49.214 --> 00:33:51.854
You just need to tidy
yourself up a little bit.

721
00:33:51.854 --> 00:33:53.548
Get some new clothes.

722
00:33:53.548 --> 00:33:55.352
Have a bath.

723
00:33:55.352 --> 00:33:56.023
A bath?

724
00:33:56.023 --> 00:33:59.158
You do know
what they say. right?

725
00:33:59.895 --> 00:34:00.588
What do they say?

726
00:34:00.588 --> 00:34:02.392
She’ll be thankful
for an ankle.

727
00:34:02.392 --> 00:34:05.032
- Yes.
- And pleased to see your knees.

728
00:34:05.032 --> 00:34:06.132
- Right.
- But if you wanna

729
00:34:06.132 --> 00:34:08.266
make her sigh...
- Tell me.

730
00:34:08.266 --> 00:34:10.532
Show her some thigh.

731
00:34:11.874 --> 00:34:12.908
Bleacher!

732
00:34:12.908 --> 00:34:14.272
It’s overflowing now.

733
00:34:14.272 --> 00:34:16.175
Get in there. Back to work.
- All right.

734
00:34:16.175 --> 00:34:17.572
It’s up to me ankles!

735
00:34:17.572 --> 00:34:19.475
- Time-waster.

736
00:34:19.475 --> 00:34:21.180
- Bleacher!

737
00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:24.216
Curse that idle peasant.

738
00:34:32.554 --> 00:34:34.490
What you got there?

739
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:36.228
Nothing.

740
00:34:36.294 --> 00:34:39.198
Do you like that coop. Noodle?

741
00:34:39.198 --> 00:34:39.968
All right.

742
00:34:39.968 --> 00:34:43.301
I was collecting laundry
from Professor Monocle
the other day.

743
00:34:43.301 --> 00:34:44.005
Yeah.

744
00:34:44.005 --> 00:34:46.535
He’s writing a book about
the Bavarian Royal Family.

745
00:34:46.535 --> 00:34:47.206
Boring.

746
00:34:47.206 --> 00:34:49.945
He’s got sketches of noblemen
all over his wall.

747
00:34:49.945 --> 00:34:50.407
So?

748
00:34:50.407 --> 00:34:53.278
This one
looked rather familiar.

749
00:34:54.642 --> 00:34:55.313
Oh.

750
00:34:55.313 --> 00:34:57.953
Blow me.
That looks exactly like...

751
00:34:57.953 --> 00:34:59.284
Mr. Bleacher.

752
00:34:59.284 --> 00:35:03.552
Are you telling me Bleacher
is a Bavarian aristocrat?

753
00:35:03.552 --> 00:35:05.356
- Uh-huh.

00:35:05.356 --> 00:35:07.325

No. ya didn’t.

About yea high.

824
00:37:45.186 --> 00:37:46.451
Comes in the dead
of the night.

825
00:37:46.451 --> 00:37:47.716
and he steals
all my chocolate.

826
00:37:47.716 --> 00:37:51.687
Been happening every few weeks
for the past three.
four years now.

827

Really?

828
00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:53.425
Sometimes I spy him

829
00:37:53.425 --> 00:37:55.625
in that strange realm
’twixt sleep and wake.

830
00:37:55.625 --> 00:37:57.825
green hair glinting
in the moonlight.

831
00:37:57.825 --> 00:37:58.727
Green hair?

832
00:37:58.727 --> 00:38:00.465

catch him. Noodle.

833

- Willy.
- When I do...

834

Willy!
- Hmm?

835
00:38:02.566 --> 00:38:04.733
You don’t seriously expect me
to believe this. do you?

836
00:38:04.733 --> 00:38:07.802
Of course I do. What other
explanation is there?

837
00:38:07.802 --> 00:38:08.638
I don’t know.

838
00:38:08.638 --> 00:38:10.211

- Mm-hmm.

839
00:38:10.211 --> 00:38:11.542
...dream ’bout
Little Green Man...

840
00:38:11.542 --> 00:38:12.675
Orange man. green hair. Yeah.

841
00:38:12.675 --> 00:38:14.083
...and while you’re dreaming.

842
00:38:14.083 --> 00:38:16.217
stuff your face
with chocolate!

843
00:38:16.217 --> 00:38:18.120
Stuff my...

844
00:38:18.186 --> 00:38:19.253
That makes a lot more sense.

845
00:38:19.253 --> 00:38:20.485
Why’d I ever think
this would work?

846
00:38:20.485 --> 00:38:22.124
I’ve been eating
all my own chocolate?

847
00:38:22.124 --> 00:38:23.653
- Stupid Silver Linings.
- I don’t think I have been.

848
00:38:23.653 --> 00:38:24.324
Hey!

849
00:38:24.324 --> 00:38:25.754
There’s nothing stupid
about my chocolate.

850
00:38:25.754 --> 00:38:28.262
If Mrs. Scrubitt
had spotted us.

851
00:38:28.262 --> 00:38:30.132
I’d be in the coop right now.

852
00:38:30.132 --> 00:38:31.298
Look. I’m sorry. okay?

853
00:38:31.298 --> 00:38:32.860
But we can make
more chocolate.

854
00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:35.500
Only problem is
I’m all out of milk.

855
00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:38.338
Well. that’s not a problem.

856
00:38:38.404 --> 00:38:40.373
Milk.

857
00:38:40.373 --> 00:38:42.672
A. that is stealing.

858
00:38:42.672 --> 00:38:43.376
And C.

859
00:38:43.376 --> 00:38:45.708
Willy Wonka does not use
any old cow’s milk.

860
00:38:45.708 --> 00:38:46.808
For this particular creation.

861
00:38:46.808 --> 00:38:49.712
I require the milk
of a giraffe.

862
00:38:49.712 --> 00:38:50.779
Okay... fine.

863
00:38:50.779 --> 00:38:53.485
As a matter of fact.
there’s one at the zoo.

864
00:38:53.485 --> 00:38:54.255
Bingala!

865
00:38:54.255 --> 00:38:56.851
But A.
the zoo is not that way.

866
00:38:56.851 --> 00:38:58.127
Great.

867
00:38:58.127 --> 00:38:58.622
And B.

868
00:38:58.622 --> 00:39:01.559
they’re not gonna let you just
walk in there and milk it.

869
00:39:01.559 --> 00:39:05.431
Mm. That. my dear Noodle.
is why we’re very lucky

870
00:39:05.431 --> 00:39:09.402
the Little Orange Man
didn’t find this.

871
00:39:13.472 --> 00:39:14.275
What is it?

872
00:39:14.275 --> 00:39:15.375
From Zoo Management.

873
00:39:15.375 --> 00:39:18.741
In recognition
of your years of service.

874
00:39:18.741 --> 00:39:21.513
But I’ve only
been here a year.

875
00:39:21.579 --> 00:39:26.188
Which is why
there’s only one chocolate.

876
00:39:26.551 --> 00:39:27.486
Huh.

877
00:39:27.486 --> 00:39:28.685
Well. thank you very much.

878
00:39:28.685 --> 00:39:31.655
You’re welcome.
Good night!

879
00:39:32.293 --> 00:39:33.756
Hey. well done. Noodle.

880
00:39:33.756 --> 00:39:35.725
So. what is it really?

881
00:39:35.725 --> 00:39:37.199
It’s called A Big Night Out.

882
00:39:37.199 --> 00:39:38.662
A single chocolate
that perfectly mimics

883
00:39:38.662 --> 00:39:40.532
a night on the town.
-  Mmm.

884
00:39:40.532 --> 00:39:43.403
The outer layer.
a champagne truffle.

885
00:39:43.403 --> 00:39:44.404
That’s lovely.

886
00:39:44.404 --> 00:39:46.274
The next is white wine.

887
00:39:46.274 --> 00:39:47.341
Mmm.

888
00:39:47.341 --> 00:39:48.342
Followed by red.

889
00:39:48.342 --> 00:39:49.541
Now we are talking!

890
00:39:49.541 --> 00:39:51.279
That’s when the singing
and dancing starts.

891
00:39:51.279 --> 00:39:53.710
♪ We’re gonna
Have a party tonight!♪

892
00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:57.186
It’s when he hits
the layer o’ whiskey fudge
he’ll get emotional.

893
00:39:57.186 --> 00:39:59.947
She was
the only woman I ever loved!

894
00:39:59.947 --> 00:40:02.389
He might do
something reckless.

895
00:40:02.389 --> 00:40:03.522
I’ll give her a call.

896
00:40:03.522 --> 00:40:06.327
What harm could it do?

897
00:40:06.327 --> 00:40:07.856
Hello. Gwennie? It’s Basil.

898
00:40:07.856 --> 00:40:10.760
I just wanted to say.
I’ve always loved you.

899
00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:13.301
I love you so much. What?

900
00:40:13.301 --> 00:40:14.203
It’s Basil Bond.

901
00:40:14.203 --> 00:40:15.864
We sat together
in chemistry at school.

902
00:40:15.864 --> 00:40:16.931
No. no. don’t hang up!

903
00:40:16.931 --> 00:40:20.638
Finally. some old port
from the back
of the cupboard. and...

904
00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:24.345
Hmm.

905
00:40:24.345 --> 00:40:26.446
Let’s go.

906
00:40:26.446 --> 00:40:28.382
Noodle. let’s go.

907
00:40:29.548 --> 00:40:30.813
Why don’t they
fly away?

908
00:40:30.813 --> 00:40:34.289
I don’t know.
Perhaps they haven’t
thought of it.

909
00:40:34.289 --> 00:40:36.588
You’re kidding?
No. I’m serious.

910
00:40:36.588 --> 00:40:37.919
That’s the thing
about flamingos.

911
00:40:37.919 --> 00:40:40.592
They need someone
to show ’em the way.

912
00:40:40.592 --> 00:40:42.363
Huh.

913
00:40:45.597 --> 00:40:47.599
Giraffe.

914
00:40:47.731 --> 00:40:51.636
Giraffe. Giraffe.

915
00:40:52.604 --> 00:40:54.672
Ah! Giraffe.

916
00:40:59.578 --> 00:41:02.251
You have got to learn
how to read.

917
00:41:02.251 --> 00:41:02.812
Why?

918
00:41:02.812 --> 00:41:04.385
You were nearly
eaten by a tiger.

919
00:41:04.385 --> 00:41:05.716
"Nearly" is the key word
there. Noodle.

920
00:41:05.716 --> 00:41:07.520
I’ve nearly been eaten
by a lot of things.

921
00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:10.391
and none of them
got more than a nibble.

922
00:41:11.854 --> 00:41:12.855
Giraffe.

923
00:41:12.855 --> 00:41:15.330
Okay. I’ll learn how to read.

924
00:41:33.942 --> 00:41:37.946
Good evening.
Miss. um...

925
00:41:37.946 --> 00:41:40.322
Abigail.
-  Abigail.

926
00:41:40.949 --> 00:41:42.720
Whoa! Easy. now.

927
00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:44.887
I brought acacia mints.

928
00:41:51.025 --> 00:41:51.795
Oh.

929
00:41:51.795 --> 00:41:54.831
Giraffes are just crazy
about my acacia mints.

930
00:41:54.831 --> 00:41:56.470
Love ’em more
than anything else.

931
00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:59.704
Except being scratched
under the chin. you see?

932
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:03.378
You wanna
give it a go. Noodle?

933
00:42:03.378 --> 00:42:04.643
Me?

934
00:42:04.643 --> 00:42:06.843
Yeah. Why not?

935
00:42:07.745 --> 00:42:09.648
Okay.

936
00:42:14.015 --> 00:42:15.049
- Ugh!
-  Oh!

937
00:42:15.049 --> 00:42:18.492
Think she likes you.

938
00:42:19.086 --> 00:42:20.428
Miss Abigail.

939
00:42:20.428 --> 00:42:22.892
if my colleague here
gives you a good scratch.

940
00:42:22.892 --> 00:42:24.894
do you think you could
possibly spare us

941
00:42:24.894 --> 00:42:27.336
a pint or two of your milk?

942
00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:33.738
So. have you done
this before?

943
00:42:33.738 --> 00:42:36.675
Once. In Africa.

944
00:42:36.675 --> 00:42:38.446
Magnificent beast.

945
00:42:38.446 --> 00:42:41.009
Was she wild?
Wild?

946
00:42:41.009 --> 00:42:43.484
She was absolutely furious.

947
00:42:43.484 --> 00:42:45.046
You sure can be silly. Willy.

948
00:42:45.046 --> 00:42:48.082
I suppose that’s true-dle.
Noodle.

949
00:42:48.082 --> 00:42:49.523
True-dle?

950
00:42:49.523 --> 00:42:51.019
That doesn’t work. does it?

951
00:42:51.019 --> 00:42:52.559
Nothing rhymes with Noodle.

952
00:42:52.559 --> 00:42:55.595
Where’d you get that name. anyway?

953
00:42:55.595 --> 00:42:57.091
Doesn’t matter.

954
00:42:57.498 --> 00:42:58.994
No. go on.

955
00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:02.866
This.

956
00:43:03.372 --> 00:43:06.133
It’s all I have
of my real parents. See?

957
00:43:06.133 --> 00:43:10.940
"N" for Noodle.
Or Nora. or Nina.

958
00:43:11.138 --> 00:43:13.008
or nothing at all.

959
00:43:13.008 --> 00:43:14.548
Can’t you trace the owner?

960
00:43:14.548 --> 00:43:16.814
You don’t think I’ve tried?

961
00:43:17.111 --> 00:43:18.651
When I was a kid.

962
00:43:18.651 --> 00:43:21.423
I always hoped
that I’d find my parents.

963
00:43:21.423 --> 00:43:25.460
And they’d live
in this beautiful old building
full of books.

964
00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:29.959
My mom. she’d be waiting there
for me at the door.

965
00:43:29.959 --> 00:43:30.993
and I’d run into her arms.

966
00:43:30.993 --> 00:43:35.701
She’d give me this big hug
like she’d never let me go.

967
00:43:36.735 --> 00:43:40.640
But then I realized
it was just a stupid dream.

968
00:43:42.037 --> 00:43:44.677
There’s nothing stupid
about that.

969
00:43:44.677 --> 00:43:45.645
Isn’t there?

970
00:43:45.645 --> 00:43:48.714
I know things haven’t
been easy for you. Noodle.

971
00:43:48.714 --> 00:43:49.814
But they’re gonna get better.

972
00:43:49.814 --> 00:43:53.818
I’m not gonna let you rot
in that Wash House forever.

973
00:43:53.818 --> 00:43:54.819
You promise?

974
00:43:54.819 --> 00:43:57.558
I can do better than that.

975
00:43:58.020 --> 00:43:58.988
I pinkie promise.

976
00:43:58.988 --> 00:44:01.991
And that’s the most
solemn vow there is.

977
00:44:04.961 --> 00:44:05.797
Get scratchin’.

978
00:44:05.797 --> 00:44:09.999
We don’t have long
until that guard comes
to-dle. Noodle.

979
00:44:09.999 --> 00:44:13.772
- To-dle!
- It’s not even a word!

980
00:44:13.838 --> 00:44:14.575
Oh.

981
00:44:14.575 --> 00:44:16.742

Certainly. Officer.

1022
00:47:18.088 --> 00:47:20.288
- Be on your way. Affable.
-  Are you sure. sir?

1023

Oh. yeah.
This is between
me and Mr. Wonka.

1024
00:47:23.225 --> 00:47:24.798
You better
get outta here. Noodle.

1025
00:47:24.798 --> 00:47:26.129
- But Willy...
- Don’t worry about me.

1026
00:47:26.129 --> 00:47:27.834
I’ve talked my way out
of tighter spots than this.

1027
00:47:27.834 --> 00:47:29.968
I’ll meet you
back at the cart.

1028
00:47:30.067 --> 00:47:32.740
Now. Officer.
if this is about Abigail...

1029
00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:34.676
I got a message for you. pal.

1030
00:47:34.676 --> 00:47:35.369
Whoa! No.

1031
00:47:36.304 --> 00:47:40.242
Do not sell chocolate
in this town!

1032
00:47:40.242 --> 00:47:42.948
- You got it?

1033
00:47:43.652 --> 00:47:44.686
Not really. I’m afraid.

1034
00:47:44.686 --> 00:47:48.217
Oh. so you got a mouth on you.
huh. Candy Man?

1035
00:47:48.217 --> 00:47:48.987
I said...

1036
00:47:48.987 --> 00:47:52.760
- Don’t sell chocolate!

1037
00:47:53.695 --> 00:47:55.290
You hear me that time?

1038
00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:57.930
I have water in my ears.

1039
00:47:58.095 --> 00:47:58.931
Oh.

1040
00:47:58.931 --> 00:48:00.768
Yeah. that... You’ve...

1041
00:48:00.768 --> 00:48:03.067
Okay. that makes sense. Yeah.

1042
00:48:03.067 --> 00:48:05.135
Listen. I’m sorry.

1043
00:48:05.135 --> 00:48:06.708
I’m all outta whack.

1044
00:48:06.708 --> 00:48:09.304
Truth is. I don’t wanna
be doin’ this.

1045
00:48:09.304 --> 00:48:11.141
I don’t want you
to be doing this.

1046
00:48:11.141 --> 00:48:12.945
But I still gotta
give ya a message.

1047
00:48:12.945 --> 00:48:14.914
Sell chocolate
in this town again.

1048
00:48:14.914 --> 00:48:17.719
you’re gonna get more
than a bonk on the head.

1049
00:48:17.719 --> 00:48:19.721
I don’t have
a bonk on the head.

1050
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:23.351
What is with me today? I...

1051
00:48:23.351 --> 00:48:26.222
Can you give me
just a second?
- Sure.

1052
00:48:28.455 --> 00:48:29.896
Lord Bleachowitz.

1053
00:48:29.896 --> 00:48:34.736
Mrs. Scrubitt.
Your eyes are like
two rabbit droppings

1054
00:48:34.736 --> 00:48:35.704
in a couple of bowls

1055
00:48:35.704 --> 00:48:36.837
- of custard.
- Oh!

1056
00:48:36.837 --> 00:48:38.806
You really do have a way
with words.

1057
00:48:38.806 --> 00:48:41.171
See you downstairs.

1058
00:48:41.171 --> 00:48:43.008
Geronimo!

1059
00:48:43.008 --> 00:48:44.713
Ah. Mr. Wonka.

1060
00:48:44.713 --> 00:48:46.110
Good of you to join us.

1061
00:48:46.110 --> 00:48:48.783
Not late. am I?
-  Well. no.

1062
00:48:48.783 --> 00:48:50.048
Cutting it a bit fine. but...

1063
00:48:50.048 --> 00:48:51.379
Has Tiddles been
pulling his weight?

1064
00:48:51.379 --> 00:48:52.952
- As a matter of fact.

1065
00:48:52.952 --> 00:48:54.085
Tiddles has been
a very good boy.

1066
00:48:54.085 --> 00:48:56.087
and productivity is up 30%.

1067
00:48:56.087 --> 00:48:57.484
We took
the afternoon off.

1068
00:48:57.484 --> 00:48:59.222
But that’s not the point.

1069
00:48:59.222 --> 00:49:00.421
This is the point.

1070
00:49:00.421 --> 00:49:01.961
Not now. Larry.
- Sorry.

1071
00:49:01.961 --> 00:49:03.732
The point is...

1072
00:49:03.732 --> 00:49:04.458
Where have you been?

1073
00:49:04.458 --> 00:49:07.362
And why do you smell
of giraffe?

1074
00:49:07.362 --> 00:49:08.968
Guess I owe you guys
an explanation.

1075
00:49:08.968 --> 00:49:11.201
Mm.
The truth is.

1076
00:49:11.201 --> 00:49:12.334
I’m a chocolate maker.

1077
00:49:12.334 --> 00:49:15.238
Not just any chocolate.
The best in the world.

1078
00:49:15.238 --> 00:49:18.879
Ah. well.
Noodle’s flattering me.
but she’s right.

1079
00:49:18.879 --> 00:49:19.781
They’re exquisite.

1080
00:49:19.781 --> 00:49:22.784
Plan is to sell chocolate
and pay off Mrs. Scrubitt.

1081
00:49:22.784 --> 00:49:25.413
At least.
that was the plan. until...

1082
00:49:25.413 --> 00:49:26.315
Oh. let me guess.

1083
00:49:26.315 --> 00:49:30.187
You had a little run-in
with the Chief of Police?

1084
00:49:30.187 --> 00:49:31.188
How do you know that?

1085
00:49:31.188 --> 00:49:34.521
Because I was
Slugworth’s accountant.

1086
00:49:34.521 --> 00:49:35.929
For a week. at least.

1087
00:49:35.929 --> 00:49:37.524
His regular bookkeeper
was off sick.

1088
00:49:37.524 --> 00:49:39.328
- Station. please.
-  And I was called

1089
00:49:39.328 --> 00:49:42.265
halfway across the country
to take his place.

1090
00:49:42.265 --> 00:49:44.003
Good evening. Mr. Slugworth.

1091
00:49:44.003 --> 00:49:47.006
I just need
your signature on...

1092
00:49:47.006 --> 00:49:49.437
Seemed a straightforward job.

1093
00:49:49.437 --> 00:49:50.306
Oh.

1094
00:49:50.306 --> 00:49:52.209
Until I realized

1095
00:49:52.209 --> 00:49:54.915
there were two sets of books.

1096
00:49:54.915 --> 00:49:56.950
One for the authorities.

1097
00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:59.546
and one which told the truth.

1098
00:49:59.546 --> 00:50:03.418
Slugworth. Fickelgruber.
and Prodnose

1099
00:50:03.418 --> 00:50:05.288
have been in cahoots
for years.

1100
00:50:05.288 --> 00:50:08.060
A sort of chocolate cartel.
if you will.

1101
00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:10.260
They’ve been watering down
their chocolate

1102
00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:13.395
and storing the excess
in a secret vault

1103
00:50:13.395 --> 00:50:14.968
deep beneath the cathedral.

1104
00:50:14.968 --> 00:50:18.235
guarded round the clock
by a corrupt cleric

1105
00:50:18.235 --> 00:50:21.909
and 500 chocoholic monks.

1106
00:50:21.909 --> 00:50:26.012
The only way in is down
a secret elevator. and past

1107
00:50:26.012 --> 00:50:28.377
the Mistress of the Keys.

1108
00:50:28.377 --> 00:50:30.412
A subterranean sentinel...

1109
00:50:30.412 --> 00:50:32.821
...who hasn’t seen
sunlight in years.

1110
00:50:32.821 --> 00:50:34.218
Good evening.

1111
00:50:34.218 --> 00:50:36.055
There’s thousands
of gallons of chocolate

1112
00:50:36.055 --> 00:50:39.421
down there. and the Cartel
use it to bribe.

1113
00:50:39.421 --> 00:50:42.127
blackmail. and bludgeon
the competition.

1114
00:50:42.127 --> 00:50:44.833
I do not care that
they were school children...

1115
00:50:44.833 --> 00:50:48.232
...they were in our way.
Next time. put your foot down.

1116
00:50:48.232 --> 00:50:49.068
Miss Bon-Bon?

1117
00:50:49.068 --> 00:50:50.498
Good morning. Mr. Slugworth.

1118
00:50:50.498 --> 00:50:53.567
From now on. I’ll be keeping
the ledger in the vault.

1119
00:50:53.567 --> 00:50:55.877
Very good. sir.

1120
00:50:56.504 --> 00:50:58.407
Oh. and Mr. Crunch?

1121
00:50:59.606 --> 00:51:00.508
Yes?

1122
00:51:00.508 --> 00:51:02.543
You’re fired.

1123
00:51:04.149 --> 00:51:05.887
Very good. sir.

1124
00:51:06.316 --> 00:51:07.889
I’m sorry. Mr. Wonka.

1125
00:51:07.889 --> 00:51:10.958
but they’ve got you
right where they want you.

1126
00:51:10.958 --> 00:51:13.620
You can’t get a shop
without selling chocolate.

1127
00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:18.064
and you can’t sell chocolate
without a shop.

1128
00:51:20.869 --> 00:51:22.464
Hey. Noodle!

1129
00:51:22.464 --> 00:51:24.235
Noodle! Psst!

1130
00:51:25.467 --> 00:51:27.040
What is it. Willy?

1131
00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:28.305
Watch out.

1132
00:51:28.305 --> 00:51:29.603
Whoa!

1133
00:51:34.641 --> 00:51:35.609
What’s this for?

1134
00:51:35.609 --> 00:51:39.580
Your wages.
A lifetime supply. remember?

1135
00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:41.054
You didn’t have to do that.

1136
00:51:41.054 --> 00:51:44.893
Of course I did.
I gave you my word.

1137
00:51:45.025 --> 00:51:46.323
Well. thanks.

1138
00:51:46.323 --> 00:51:50.294
I’ve got something
for you. too.
- For me?

1139
00:51:55.629 --> 00:51:56.432
What’s this?

1140
00:51:56.432 --> 00:51:59.501
Glass half full?
- Other way up.

1141
00:51:59.501 --> 00:52:00.975
Glass half empty.

1142
00:52:00.975 --> 00:52:03.505
It’s an "A."
Your first letter.

1143
00:52:03.505 --> 00:52:05.980
I’m teaching you to read.

1144
00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:06.574
Oh. Noodle.

1145
00:52:06.574 --> 00:52:09.676
Well. I can’t have
my business partner
eaten by a tiger.

1146
00:52:09.676 --> 00:52:11.414
Or nearly eaten.

1147
00:52:11.414 --> 00:52:12.382
So we’re still partners?

1148
00:52:12.382 --> 00:52:14.648
Sure. but I don’t know
how we’re gonna
sell any chocolate.

1149
00:52:14.648 --> 00:52:19.323
Every time the police show up.
you’d have to vanish
into thin air.

1150
00:52:19.323 --> 00:52:20.522
Like a magician.

1151
00:52:20.522 --> 00:52:21.358
Right!

1152
00:52:21.358 --> 00:52:23.360
Yeah. but it’s one thing
when you’re onstage.

1153
00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:26.231
You have ropes and pulleys
and trapdoors.

1154
00:52:26.231 --> 00:52:27.496
There’s none of those
on the street.

1155
00:52:27.496 --> 00:52:29.498
As a matter of fact.
there are.

1156
00:52:29.498 --> 00:52:32.105
There are trapdoors
all over the city.

1157
00:52:32.105 --> 00:52:33.601
They’re called storm drains.

1158
00:52:33.601 --> 00:52:35.108
I’d be happy
to show you around

1159
00:52:35.108 --> 00:52:36.274
if you cut me in
on the action.

1160
00:52:36.274 --> 00:52:38.111
-  If you’re recruiting.

1161
00:52:38.111 --> 00:52:40.014
I’d do anything
to get out of here

1162
00:52:40.014 --> 00:52:41.048
and make up with my wife.

1163
00:52:41.048 --> 00:52:43.479
I don’t have
any practical skills. but.

1164
00:52:43.479 --> 00:52:46.152
I can talk
like I’m under water.

1165
00:52:46.152 --> 00:52:49.452
And if you need someone
to handle communications.

1166
00:52:49.452 --> 00:52:51.157
I’m your woman.

1167
00:52:51.157 --> 00:52:52.554
Lottie?

1168
00:52:52.554 --> 00:52:54.325
What? Why you all
staring at me?

1169
00:52:54.325 --> 00:52:56.096
I did not know
she could speak.

1170
00:52:56.096 --> 00:52:58.263
I thought you were a mime.
-  No.

1171
00:52:58.263 --> 00:53:01.068
I actually used to work
at the telephone exchange.

1172
00:53:01.068 --> 00:53:04.665
But back then.
I was quite the chatterbox.

1173
00:53:04.665 --> 00:53:06.975
But since I came here.

1174
00:53:07.107 --> 00:53:08.570
I haven’t had much
to chat about.

1175
00:53:08.570 --> 00:53:10.539
-  Far be it from me

1176
00:53:10.539 --> 00:53:12.310
to pour cold water
on all your fun.

1177
00:53:12.310 --> 00:53:15.115
but if Mrs. Scrubitt
catches you trying to escape.

1178
00:53:15.115 --> 00:53:18.349
you’ll all get six months
in the coop.

1179
00:53:18.349 --> 00:53:19.317
So just think about that

1180
00:53:19.317 --> 00:53:22.518
before getting involved
in this harebrained scheme.

1181
00:53:22.518 --> 00:53:25.026
But it’s not harebrained.
Abacus.

1182
00:53:25.026 --> 00:53:27.721
Willy’s chocolates
are incredible.

1183
00:53:27.721 --> 00:53:28.491
Try one.

1184
00:53:28.491 --> 00:53:30.064
That’s very kind
of you. Noodle.

1185
00:53:30.064 --> 00:53:34.002
I don’t care how good
his chocolates are.

1186
00:53:35.003 --> 00:53:37.071
When do we start?

1187
00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:49.149
I guess what I’m trying
to say. Barbara. is. um.

1188
00:53:49.149 --> 00:53:52.383
- will you marry me?
-  Oh.

1189
00:53:52.383 --> 00:53:53.186
I dunno. Colin.

1190
00:53:53.186 --> 00:53:55.023
You’re a lovely man.
but I’m looking for someone

1191
00:53:55.023 --> 00:53:56.321
to sweep me off my feet.
You know.

1192
00:53:56.321 --> 00:53:59.489
whisk me off
to a life of adventure.

1193
00:53:59.489 --> 00:54:01.557
Could that be you?

1194
00:54:01.755 --> 00:54:02.789
- No.
- Oh.

1195
00:54:02.789 --> 00:54:05.495
Not with my chronic
lack of self-confidence.

1196
00:54:05.495 --> 00:54:08.201
Uh. I best be off.
- Oh. but Colin...

1197
00:54:08.201 --> 00:54:11.237
Sorry to have
wasted your time. Barbara.

1198
00:54:11.237 --> 00:54:13.206
Uh. taxi!

1199
00:54:18.178 --> 00:54:20.312
Uh. monsieur.
can I help you?

1200
00:54:20.312 --> 00:54:21.511
Oh. waiter.

1201
00:54:21.511 --> 00:54:24.712

1297
00:58:37.866 --> 00:58:40.341

No. no. no. no.

Okay.

1300
00:58:47.579 --> 00:58:49.977

Ooh!

1305
00:59:58.485 --> 01:00:00.784
- Gotcha!

1306
01:00:00.784 --> 01:00:01.884
What the devil?

1307
01:00:01.884 --> 01:00:04.557
Let me out of here.
I demand to be released.

1308
01:00:04.557 --> 01:00:06.427
Incredible.
It can speak.

1309
01:00:06.427 --> 01:00:07.890
Well.
of course I can speak.

1310
01:00:07.890 --> 01:00:09.793
Now let me out of here.
or I shall shriek.

1311
01:00:09.793 --> 01:00:11.432
-  Wow.
- Let me out!

1312
01:00:11.432 --> 01:00:14.996
Not until I take
a good look at you.

1313
01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:17.405
-  Wow.

1314
01:00:17.405 --> 01:00:18.032
Good evening.

1315
01:00:18.032 --> 01:00:20.705
So you’re the funny little man
who’s been following me.

1316
01:00:20.705 --> 01:00:23.510
"Funny little man"?
How dare you.

1317
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:24.445
I will have you know

1318
01:00:24.445 --> 01:00:26.172
that I am a perfectly
respectable size

1319
01:00:26.172 --> 01:00:28.581
for an Oompa Loompa.

1320
01:00:28.581 --> 01:00:29.516
An Oompa-what-now?

1321
01:00:29.516 --> 01:00:32.783
In fact. in Loompaland.
I am regarded
as something of a whopper.

1322
01:00:32.783 --> 01:00:34.455
They call me Lofty.

1323
01:00:34.455 --> 01:00:36.622
So. I will thank you
to stop gawping at me

1324
01:00:36.622 --> 01:00:37.887
as though I was
something unpleasant

1325
01:00:37.887 --> 01:00:39.185
you’d found
in your handkerchief.

1326
01:00:39.185 --> 01:00:43.431
I find it uncomfortable
and. frankly. rude.

1327
01:00:43.431 --> 01:00:44.498
Um...

1328
01:00:44.498 --> 01:00:45.928
- Sorry.
- Now let me out of here.

1329
01:00:45.928 --> 01:00:47.435
You have absolutely no right

1330
01:00:47.435 --> 01:00:50.537
to go around
embottling innocent strangers.

1331
01:00:50.537 --> 01:00:51.098
Innocent?

1332
01:00:51.098 --> 01:00:53.969
Hold on. you’ve been
stealing from me. For years.

1333
01:00:53.969 --> 01:00:55.971
Well. you started it.

1334
01:00:55.971 --> 01:00:56.675
Me?

1335
01:00:56.675 --> 01:00:58.941
You stole our cocoa beans.

1336
01:00:58.941 --> 01:01:01.108
What are you talking about?

1337
01:01:01.108 --> 01:01:04.881
Do you mean
that you don’t even remember?

1338
01:01:04.881 --> 01:01:06.520
Remember what?

1339
01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:09.116
The day you...

1340
01:01:09.182 --> 01:01:11.184
destroyed my life.

1341
01:01:11.184 --> 01:01:13.692
No. I don’t remember that.

1342
01:01:13.692 --> 01:01:14.726
Well then. young man.

1343
01:01:14.726 --> 01:01:16.156
Allow me
to refresh your memory

1344
01:01:16.156 --> 01:01:19.566

so ruinously catchy

leave your mind.

1346
01:01:22.899 --> 01:01:24.164
Oh. I don’t think
I wanna hear that.

1347
01:01:24.164 --> 01:01:25.704

01:03:38.738 --> 01:03:40.135
and jumped out of the window.

1407
01:03:40.135 --> 01:03:43.072
Of course he did.

1408
01:03:43.138 --> 01:03:45.107
You don’t believe me. do you?

1409
01:03:45.107 --> 01:03:46.746
Honestly? No.

1410
01:03:46.746 --> 01:03:47.846
No!

1411
01:03:47.846 --> 01:03:48.374
No.

1412
01:03:48.374 --> 01:03:50.717
- No.
- Definitely not.

1413
01:03:50.717 --> 01:03:51.344
But.

1414
01:03:51.344 --> 01:03:52.818
as it so happens.

1415
01:03:52.818 --> 01:03:55.051
we don’t need
to sell chocolate today.

1416
01:03:55.051 --> 01:03:55.953
And why is that?

1417
01:03:55.953 --> 01:03:57.020
You know that shop?

1418
01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:59.759
The one you’ve
been dreaming of?

1419
01:04:13.905 --> 01:04:16.743
Now. I know
what you’re thinking.

1420
01:04:16.743 --> 01:04:19.911
It may need a little work.

1421
01:04:20.846 --> 01:04:22.375
Looks like someone
left the water running

1422
01:04:22.375 --> 01:04:24.179
twenty years ago
and the ceiling fell through.

1423
01:04:24.179 --> 01:04:27.149
And the ceiling above that.
and the ceiling above that.

1424
01:04:27.149 --> 01:04:29.921
But that means
we can afford it.

1425
01:04:29.921 --> 01:04:31.021
For a week. anyway.

1426
01:04:31.021 --> 01:04:32.924
And we’d finally
be legitimate.

1427
01:04:32.924 --> 01:04:34.893
The police wouldn’t
have any excuse

1428
01:04:34.893 --> 01:04:36.763
to keep bothering us.

1429
01:04:36.763 --> 01:04:39.964
So.
what do you think. Willy?

1430
01:04:39.964 --> 01:04:41.702
Do you like it?

1431
01:04:43.264 --> 01:04:45.266
Do I like it?

1432
01:04:47.037 --> 01:04:48.940
Noodle. it’s just
as I always imagined.

1433
01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:52.812
No. scratch that.
it’s better than I imagined.

1434
01:04:52.812 --> 01:04:53.879
I mean. look at this place.

1435
01:04:53.879 --> 01:04:56.376
I mean. yeah. it’s a wreck.
but... the potential!

1436
01:04:56.376 --> 01:04:57.685
The bones!

1437
01:04:57.685 --> 01:05:00.182
You mark my words.
this is gonna
be the best chocolate shop

1438
01:05:00.182 --> 01:05:01.821
the world has ever seen.
- Whoo!

1439
01:05:01.821 --> 01:05:03.757
You won’t be scrub-scrubbin’
much longer. Noodle.

1440
01:05:03.757 --> 01:05:05.858
-  We’ll all be free.

1441
01:05:05.858 --> 01:05:07.695
As free as flamingos!

1442
01:05:19.168 --> 01:05:21.236
There’s six of them
in total.

1443
01:05:21.236 --> 01:05:22.270
Including the little girl.

1444
01:05:22.270 --> 01:05:24.305
She seems to be the brains
of the operation.

1445
01:05:24.305 --> 01:05:28.144
They’re based out of a laundry
called Scrubitt and Bleacher.

1446
01:05:28.144 --> 01:05:30.245
Scrubitt’s?

1447
01:05:30.245 --> 01:05:32.313
That’s right. Why. you know it?

1448
01:05:32.313 --> 01:05:34.887
Yes. as a matter of fact.
I do.

1449
01:05:34.887 --> 01:05:36.086
They just
rented a shop.

1450
01:05:36.086 --> 01:05:38.385
So. legally. I can’t
touch them. But illegally.

1451
01:05:38.385 --> 01:05:40.959
I’m happy to do
whatever you guys want.

1452
01:05:40.959 --> 01:05:43.027
You want ’em all
to have a little accident?

1453
01:05:43.027 --> 01:05:44.358
In which they die?

1454
01:05:44.358 --> 01:05:45.227
Not a problem.

1455
01:05:45.227 --> 01:05:47.394
But it’s gonna cost you
a lot more chocolate.

1456
01:05:47.394 --> 01:05:48.362
It’s all right. Chief.

1457
01:05:48.362 --> 01:05:50.496
And also. I’d. uh.
be grateful for an advance.

1458
01:05:50.496 --> 01:05:53.741
’Cause the last boxes
you gave me...

1459
01:05:53.741 --> 01:05:55.138
they’re gone.

1460
01:05:55.138 --> 01:05:55.941
All of them?

1461
01:05:55.941 --> 01:05:57.272
I’ve been eating
these little paper cases

1462
01:05:57.272 --> 01:05:58.845
for the... for the past
three days.

1463
01:05:58.845 --> 01:06:01.309
You know. you think they’re
gonna give you the same hit.

1464
01:06:01.309 --> 01:06:03.476
They don’t.

1465
01:06:03.476 --> 01:06:04.411
Oh.

1466
01:06:04.411 --> 01:06:05.885
There you go. Chief.

1467
01:06:05.885 --> 01:06:08.184
There’s plenty more
where that came from.

1468
01:06:08.184 --> 01:06:09.922
You stand down for now.

1469
01:06:09.922 --> 01:06:12.122
We’ll give you a call
when the time is right.

1470
01:06:18.326 --> 01:06:19.459
What is it. Arthur?

1471
01:06:19.459 --> 01:06:20.427
The girl.

1472
01:06:20.427 --> 01:06:23.936
You don’t really think
it could be her. do you?

1473
01:06:24.398 --> 01:06:25.102
I do.

1474
01:06:25.102 --> 01:06:28.402
You always assured us
she wouldn’t be a problem.

1475
01:06:28.402 --> 01:06:30.811
He’s right. You did assure us.

1476
01:06:30.811 --> 01:06:32.406
And she won’t be.

1477
01:06:32.406 --> 01:06:33.539
Nor will Wonka.

1478
01:06:33.539 --> 01:06:36.542
I’ll see to it. personally.

1479
01:06:39.083 --> 01:06:41.547
Who is it?
What d’you want?

1480
01:06:44.154 --> 01:06:46.552
Mr. Slugworth.

1481
01:06:46.552 --> 01:06:48.796
Just a minute. sir.

1482
01:06:49.357 --> 01:06:50.193
Good evening.

1483
01:06:50.193 --> 01:06:53.460
- Good evening.
-  Who is it.
puffy-wu...

1484
01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:55.297
-  Stone me.

1485
01:06:55.297 --> 01:06:56.232
It’s Mr. Slugworth.

1486
01:06:56.232 --> 01:06:58.872
To what do we owe the honor?

1487
01:06:58.872 --> 01:07:01.303
You have a guest.
A Mr. Wonka?

1488
01:07:01.303 --> 01:07:03.206
He’s been sneaking out
to sell chocolate

1489
01:07:03.206 --> 01:07:05.175
with the help
of your serving girl.

1490
01:07:05.175 --> 01:07:07.045
Why. that little brat.

1491
01:07:07.045 --> 01:07:08.013
Well. quite.

1492
01:07:08.013 --> 01:07:12.281
I wondered if you might
help me put an end to their...

1493
01:07:12.347 --> 01:07:14.118
business.

1494
01:07:22.896 --> 01:07:25.228
Here we go. Mamma.

1495
01:07:33.434 --> 01:07:37.372
Ladies and gentlemen.
greetings to you all.

1496
01:07:37.372 --> 01:07:40.309
and welcome to Wonka’s.

1497
01:07:40.309 --> 01:07:42.344
Tremendous things
are in store.

1498
01:07:42.344 --> 01:07:46.249
both literally
and metaphorically.

1499
01:07:46.249 --> 01:07:47.580
What?

1500
01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:49.351
In there?

1501
01:07:49.989 --> 01:07:51.419

That comes to 89 sovereigns.

1559
01:11:30.341 --> 01:11:32.838
A bargain at twice the price.

1560
01:11:32.838 --> 01:11:33.641
Thank you. sir.

1561
01:11:33.641 --> 01:11:36.248
And how would
you like your change?

1562
01:11:36.248 --> 01:11:38.316
Spendable or edible?

1563
01:11:38.316 --> 01:11:40.648
Oh. edible. please.

1564
01:11:41.517 --> 01:11:42.815
Enjoy.

1565
01:11:42.815 --> 01:11:46.225
And. uh. don’t forget
to eat your basket.

1566
01:11:46.225 --> 01:11:47.259
Oh.

1567
01:11:47.259 --> 01:11:50.163
Abacus. that man just
gave us 100 sovereigns.

1568
01:11:50.163 --> 01:11:52.759
I know. Noodle!

1569
01:11:52.759 --> 01:11:53.661
Who’s next?

1570
01:11:53.661 --> 01:11:55.168
That’ll be me.
Me!

1571
01:11:59.766 --> 01:12:00.767
Uh...

1572
01:12:00.767 --> 01:12:02.142
Mr. Wonka?

1573
01:12:02.142 --> 01:12:03.638
Yes?

1574
01:12:03.869 --> 01:12:05.706
What’s going on here?

1575
01:12:05.706 --> 01:12:07.180
Oh. my goodness.

1576
01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:08.544
That’s impossible.

1577
01:12:08.544 --> 01:12:10.381
Unless...

1578
01:12:13.186 --> 01:12:15.419
Yeti sweat?

1579
01:12:15.419 --> 01:12:17.586
The most powerful
hair potion in the world.

1580
01:12:17.586 --> 01:12:19.489
But I didn’t put it in there.

1581
01:12:19.489 --> 01:12:22.195
Ladies and gentlemen!
Your attention. please!

1582
01:12:22.195 --> 01:12:24.626
There appears
to be a manufacturing error.

1583
01:12:24.626 --> 01:12:26.562
Nobody eat the flowers!

1584
01:12:26.562 --> 01:12:28.597
Uh. why not?

1585
01:12:28.597 --> 01:12:29.532
What’s wrong with them?

1586
01:12:29.532 --> 01:12:31.237
What’s the matter
with this toadstool?

1587
01:12:31.237 --> 01:12:33.635
My daughter took one bite.
and just look at her!

1588
01:12:33.635 --> 01:12:36.572
There’s nothing wrong
with the chocolate milk.

1589
01:12:36.572 --> 01:12:37.342
is there?

1590
01:12:37.342 --> 01:12:38.442
I’m terribly sorry. everyone.

1591
01:12:38.442 --> 01:12:40.147
and I don’t know
how to explain this. but...

1592
01:12:40.147 --> 01:12:42.677
it appears that the chocolates
have been poisoned!

1593
01:12:42.677 --> 01:12:43.777
- Poisoned?

1594
01:12:43.777 --> 01:12:45.647
- Poisoned?
- He poisoned my child!

1595
01:12:45.647 --> 01:12:47.682
I didn’t...
I didn’t poison them.

1596
01:12:47.682 --> 01:12:49.519
I want my money back.

1597
01:12:49.519 --> 01:12:50.850
I want compensation.

1598
01:12:50.850 --> 01:12:52.819
I want revenge.

1599
01:12:53.655 --> 01:12:54.788
Whoa!

1600
01:13:00.266 --> 01:13:01.795
No. no! Please!

1601
01:13:05.766 --> 01:13:09.770
This is what you get for
mustach-ing my daughter!

1602
01:13:11.376 --> 01:13:15.215
I’ll wait for you.
Help! I have
to get away from this place.

1603
01:13:15.908 --> 01:13:17.712
And that. I believe.

1604
01:13:17.712 --> 01:13:21.848
is the end
of Wonka’s Chocolate Shop.

1605
01:13:40.471 --> 01:13:42.770
I don’t understand.
What...

1606
01:13:44.673 --> 01:13:45.938
What...

1607
01:13:46.576 --> 01:13:47.544
What happened?

1608
01:13:47.544 --> 01:13:49.414
Isn’t it obvious?

1609
01:13:49.414 --> 01:13:51.977
The Chocolate Cartel.

1610
01:13:53.814 --> 01:13:56.883
It’s okay. Willy.
We can rebuild.

1611
01:13:56.883 --> 01:13:58.258
We can start again.

1612
01:13:58.258 --> 01:14:00.590
There’s no point. Noodle.

1613
01:14:01.459 --> 01:14:03.329
It didn’t work.

1614
01:14:03.329 --> 01:14:04.594
What do you mean?

1615
01:14:04.594 --> 01:14:07.465
She promised
she would be here.

1616
01:14:08.796 --> 01:14:09.962
She wasn’t.

1617
01:14:09.962 --> 01:14:12.404
You didn’t actually
think that...

1618
01:14:12.404 --> 01:14:13.933
No. I did.

1619
01:14:16.276 --> 01:14:16.936
Stupid dream.

1620
01:14:16.936 --> 01:14:19.543
Don’t say that. Willy.
Please don’t ever...

1621
01:14:19.543 --> 01:14:21.281
Come on. Noodle.

1622
01:14:21.281 --> 01:14:25.010
I think Mr. Wonka
needs to be alone.

1623
01:14:35.295 --> 01:14:41.466
Every good thing
in this world
started with a dream.

1624
01:14:43.963 --> 01:14:46.735
So you hold on to yours.

1625
01:14:46.735 --> 01:14:52.312
And when
you do share chocolate
with the world. oh...

1626
01:14:52.939 --> 01:14:56.580
I’ll be right there beside ya.

1627
01:14:57.548 --> 01:15:01.288
Terrible shame.
what happened here.

1628
01:15:02.421 --> 01:15:03.752
Take it you’re
responsible?

1629
01:15:03.752 --> 01:15:06.821
Us? Oh. no.
Well. not personally.

1630
01:15:06.821 --> 01:15:10.561
We may have
encouraged Mrs. Scrubitt

1631
01:15:10.561 --> 01:15:12.365
to enhance your creations.

1632
01:15:12.365 --> 01:15:13.663
We paid her
to poison them.

1633
01:15:13.663 --> 01:15:17.370
Yes.
thank you. Gerald.
You’re welcome.

1634
01:15:17.370 --> 01:15:18.998
So why have you come?

1635
01:15:18.998 --> 01:15:20.901
- To gloat?
- Oh. no. Mr. Wonka.

1636
01:15:20.901 --> 01:15:23.409
I don’t waste my time
with that sort of thing.

1637
01:15:23.409 --> 01:15:26.412
We’ve come
to offer you a deal.

1638
01:15:26.412 --> 01:15:32.077
This is the precise amount
you owe Mrs. Scrubitt.

1639
01:15:32.077 --> 01:15:35.718
This is for
the number cruncher.

1640
01:15:35.916 --> 01:15:37.390
the plumber.

1641
01:15:37.390 --> 01:15:39.524
the telephonist.

1642
01:15:39.524 --> 01:15:43.330
the so-called funny-man.

1643
01:15:43.330 --> 01:15:45.530
and this...

1644
01:15:46.630 --> 01:15:47.565
is for the girl.

1645
01:15:47.565 --> 01:15:49.633
Now. we put in
a bit extra for her.

1646
01:15:49.633 --> 01:15:51.932
So that she can
get a place to live.

1647
01:15:51.932 --> 01:15:53.769
clothes. toys...

1648
01:15:54.605 --> 01:15:56.475
books.

1649
01:15:56.805 --> 01:15:58.708
Oh. yes. Mr. Wonka.

1650
01:15:58.708 --> 01:16:04.516
You could change her life.
Change all their lives.

1651
01:16:05.385 --> 01:16:07.519
And what would I have to do?

1652
01:16:07.684 --> 01:16:09.455
Leave town.

1653
01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:11.556
Oh. and. um.

1654
01:16:11.688 --> 01:16:14.889
never make chocolate again.

1655
01:16:14.889 --> 01:16:17.056
There’s a boat
sailing at midnight.

1656
01:16:17.056 --> 01:16:19.663
And for their sake.
as much as your own.

1657
01:16:19.663 --> 01:16:22.699

1688

But I bring glad tidings
on that score.

1689

What’s that?

1690
01:18:59.251 --> 01:19:01.022
I’ve been doing my sums.

1691
01:19:01.022 --> 01:19:03.255
One more jar. and we’re even.

1692
01:19:03.255 --> 01:19:06.698
Or. if you prefer.
I will accept half a jar

1693

of those rather
amusing Hoverchocs.

1694
01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:10.801
- You’re outta luck.

1695
01:19:10.801 --> 01:19:11.967
I don’t make chocolate
anymore.

1696
01:19:11.967 --> 01:19:16.202
Oh. dear. please don’t tell me
you’re going to go through
with this ridiculous deal?

1697
01:19:16.202 --> 01:19:17.236
I have to.

1698
01:19:17.236 --> 01:19:19.040
For Noodle.

1699
01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:21.812
I promised her a better life.

1700
01:19:22.043 --> 01:19:22.945
I pinkie promised.

1701
01:19:22.945 --> 01:19:24.881
You should stand up
to those bullies.

1702
01:19:24.881 --> 01:19:26.014
Give ’em the old one-two.

1703
01:19:26.014 --> 01:19:29.050
That’s what
an Oompa Loompa would do.

1704
01:19:31.052 --> 01:19:32.086
But if you are determined

1705
01:19:32.086 --> 01:19:35.155
to just sit there
feeling sorry for yourself.

1706
01:19:35.155 --> 01:19:36.926
I am going flat.

1707
01:19:36.926 --> 01:19:38.664
Good night. sir.

1708
01:19:47.233 --> 01:19:48.333
Huh.

1709
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:54.174
What is it?

1710
01:19:54.174 --> 01:19:54.977
No. nothing.

1711
01:19:54.977 --> 01:19:58.684
Well. it’s obviously something
because you said. "Huh."

1712
01:19:58.684 --> 01:20:01.016
I’m sorry. Forget it.

1713
01:20:01.346 --> 01:20:05.020
- Very well.

1714
01:20:09.057 --> 01:20:09.728
Huh.

1715
01:20:09.728 --> 01:20:11.125
Oh. you did it again.

1716
01:20:11.125 --> 01:20:12.731
Tell me what it is.
or I shall poke you

1717
01:20:12.731 --> 01:20:14.029
quite viciously
with a cocktail stick.

1718
01:20:14.029 --> 01:20:16.130
Look. Where Slugworth
shook my hand.

1719
01:20:16.130 --> 01:20:17.967
His ring left a mark. See?

1720
01:20:17.967 --> 01:20:19.870
It’s an "A."
surrounded by "S"s.

1721
01:20:19.870 --> 01:20:22.741
So what?
His name is Arthur Slugworth.

1722
01:20:22.741 --> 01:20:24.105
It’s probably a family ring.

1723
01:20:24.105 --> 01:20:26.272
Yes. but Noodle has one
just like it.

1724
01:20:26.272 --> 01:20:27.141
- Noodle?
- Uh-huh.

1725
01:20:27.141 --> 01:20:31.310
Why would Noodle the orphan
have a Slugworth family ring?

1726
01:20:31.310 --> 01:20:33.884
There’s only one reason
I can think of.

1727
01:20:33.884 --> 01:20:34.654
Which is?

1728
01:20:34.654 --> 01:20:36.249
And if I’m correct. Noodle
could be in grave danger.

1729
01:20:36.249 --> 01:20:38.625
Well. come on. Wonka.
Spit it out.

1730
01:20:38.625 --> 01:20:40.253
Produce your owl pellet
of wisdom.

1731
01:20:40.253 --> 01:20:42.255
There’s no time.
I gotta get back.

1732
01:20:42.255 --> 01:20:43.729
Captain!
- Wonka?

1733
01:20:43.729 --> 01:20:47.997
Come back here. Wonka!
I demand an explanation.

1734
01:20:47.997 --> 01:20:49.328
Captain?

1735
01:20:49.867 --> 01:20:54.399
On second thoughts.
the explanation can wait.

1736
01:20:54.399 --> 01:20:56.170
Good day to you.

1737
01:21:04.651 --> 01:21:05.377
Well. gentlemen.

1738
01:21:05.377 --> 01:21:09.414
one dead chocolatier.
as requested.

1739
01:21:10.690 --> 01:21:11.317
Miss Bon-Bon?

1740
01:21:11.317 --> 01:21:13.121
Yes. Mr. Slugworth?

1741
01:21:13.121 --> 01:21:15.662
Give the chief his chocolate.

1742
01:21:23.263 --> 01:21:24.770
My. my.

1743
01:21:24.770 --> 01:21:27.036
What a lot o’ long faces
this morning.

1744
01:21:27.036 --> 01:21:30.303
It’s almost as though you lot
had a sneaky little scheme

1745
01:21:30.303 --> 01:21:32.107
to try and wriggle out
of your contracts.

1746
01:21:32.107 --> 01:21:35.748
Which spectacularly misfired.

1747
01:21:35.748 --> 01:21:38.146
But I’ve got some good news
for you lot.

1748
01:21:38.146 --> 01:21:39.180
not that you deserve it.

1749
01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:43.690
Your friend. Mr. Wonka.
done a deal with Mr. Slugworth.

1750
01:21:43.690 --> 01:21:44.185
What?

1751
01:21:44.185 --> 01:21:48.794
Gave up on his dream
to settle your accounts.

1752
01:21:48.860 --> 01:21:51.225
Mr. Crunch.
- Present.

1753
01:21:54.393 --> 01:21:56.296
You’re free to go.

1754
01:21:57.165 --> 01:21:58.001
Scram. bookworm.

1755
01:21:58.001 --> 01:21:59.706
Bell.
Hello.

1756
01:21:59.706 --> 01:22:01.301
Sling yer hook.

1757
01:22:01.301 --> 01:22:02.005
Benz.

1758
01:22:02.005 --> 01:22:04.106
You ain’t gotta tell me twice.

1759
01:22:04.106 --> 01:22:05.272
Chucklesworth.

1760
01:22:05.272 --> 01:22:07.373
You’ve been
a terrible audience.

1761
01:22:07.373 --> 01:22:08.176
Good night!

1762
01:22:08.176 --> 01:22:09.914
Yeah. well. you ain’t been
much of a comedian. mate.

1763
01:22:09.914 --> 01:22:12.048
I know.
- Hey. Larry.

1764
01:22:12.048 --> 01:22:15.282
Keep going.
You’ve got something.

1765
01:22:15.282 --> 01:22:16.151
You scare me.

1766
01:22:16.151 --> 01:22:19.484
And finally. Noodle.

1767
01:22:19.484 --> 01:22:21.959
Biggest pile o’ the lot.

1768
01:22:21.959 --> 01:22:24.192
But this isn’t
to pay your bill.

1769
01:22:24.192 --> 01:22:26.799
This is to keep you here.

1770
01:22:26.799 --> 01:22:28.097
What do you mean?

1771
01:22:28.097 --> 01:22:30.264
My friend. Mr. Slugworth.

1772
01:22:30.264 --> 01:22:32.871
doesn’t think
nasty little urchins like you

1773
01:22:32.871 --> 01:22:34.268
should be out on the streets.

1774
01:22:34.268 --> 01:22:35.841
lowering the tone.

1775
01:22:35.841 --> 01:22:37.337
So. he gave me this money

1776
01:22:37.337 --> 01:22:41.209
to keep you down
in the Wash House for good.

1777
01:22:41.209 --> 01:22:44.146
And I’m only
too happy to oblige.

1778
01:22:44.146 --> 01:22:45.378
- I hate you!
-  Hey!

1779
01:22:45.378 --> 01:22:46.852
- Hey. hey. hey.

1780
01:22:46.852 --> 01:22:48.513
Look at her go.
Lord Bleachowitz.

1781
01:22:48.513 --> 01:22:50.218
- Lord Bleachowitz?

1782
01:22:50.218 --> 01:22:53.023
You don’t still think
he’s a lord. do you?

1783
01:22:53.023 --> 01:22:53.760
What?

1784
01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:55.861
We made it up.
you stupid old hag.

1785
01:22:55.861 --> 01:22:57.225
She’s...
she’s lying.

1786
01:22:57.225 --> 01:22:59.964
Right. that’s it.
you horrible little brat.

1787
01:22:59.964 --> 01:23:02.901
You’re goin’ in the coop.
my girl.

1788
01:23:02.901 --> 01:23:05.904
And you!
Take them dungarees off.

1789
01:23:05.904 --> 01:23:09.138
you... you peasant.

1790
01:23:09.138 --> 01:23:11.107
But Puffy-wuffy.

1791
01:23:11.107 --> 01:23:13.043
I wuv you.

1792
01:23:39.333 --> 01:23:40.367
Hello. Noodle.

1793
01:23:40.367 --> 01:23:44.437
Willy.
I thought you’d gone.

1794
01:23:44.503 --> 01:23:45.207
I did.

1795
01:23:45.207 --> 01:23:46.538
Slugworth promised you
a better life.

1796
01:23:46.538 --> 01:23:49.541
but he didn’t exactly
keep his side of the bargain.

1797
01:23:49.541 --> 01:23:51.213
So I came back. We all did.

1798
01:23:51.213 --> 01:23:52.478
Hey. Noodle.
How do?

1799
01:23:52.478 --> 01:23:54.183
Hey.
Surprise!

1800
01:23:54.183 --> 01:23:56.251
He wants me
locked up forever.

1801
01:23:56.251 --> 01:23:57.890
Yeah. well. that figures.

1802
01:23:57.890 --> 01:23:59.925
Why? What’s he got against me?

1803
01:23:59.925 --> 01:24:01.289
I don’t know. Noodle.
Not for sure.

1804
01:24:01.289 --> 01:24:04.226
All I know for certain
is that you won’t be safe
until Slugworth

1805
01:24:04.226 --> 01:24:07.097
- is behind bars.

1806
01:24:07.097 --> 01:24:10.298
And how exactly
is that supposed to happen?

1807
01:24:10.298 --> 01:24:12.069
Abacus.
You said the Cartel keep

1808
01:24:12.069 --> 01:24:13.840
a record
of all their dirty deeds.

1809
01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:15.006
In the green ledger. yes.

1810
01:24:15.006 --> 01:24:16.370
So if we can
get hold o’ that.

1811
01:24:16.370 --> 01:24:18.075
we can prove that
they poisoned our chocolate.

1812
01:24:18.075 --> 01:24:19.846
Scrubitt and Bleacher
would go to jail.

1813
01:24:19.846 --> 01:24:20.880
and we’ll all be free.

1814
01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:22.607
Uh. yes. but may I remind you.

1815
01:24:22.607 --> 01:24:24.983
they keep that ledger
in a vault.

1816
01:24:24.983 --> 01:24:26.479
Guarded by a corrupt cleric.

1817
01:24:26.479 --> 01:24:28.514
And 500 chocoholic monks.

1818
01:24:28.514 --> 01:24:31.022
-  Mm-hmm.
- That’s all true.

1819
01:24:31.022 --> 01:24:33.585
But I went for a long.
cold swim this morning.

1820
01:24:33.585 --> 01:24:35.224
Cold water is very good
for the brain.

1821
01:24:35.224 --> 01:24:36.962
Stimulates
the neural pathways.

1822
01:24:36.962 --> 01:24:39.459
And after just four miles.
it came to me.

1823
01:24:39.459 --> 01:24:41.164
How an ingenious orphan.

1824
01:24:41.164 --> 01:24:42.264
an accountant. a plumber.

1825
01:24:42.264 --> 01:24:44.068
a telephone exchange operator.

1826
01:24:44.068 --> 01:24:46.070
and a man
who can speak underwater.

1827
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:47.137
could combine those talents.

1828
01:24:47.137 --> 01:24:48.600
and pull off
the heist of the century.

1829
01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:51.405
But even if we do get
our hands on that ledger.

1830
01:24:51.405 --> 01:24:54.914
the Cartel will simply bribe
their way out of trouble.

1831
01:24:54.914 --> 01:24:56.883
It’s what they do.

1832
01:24:56.883 --> 01:24:58.610
The greedy
beat the needy. Willy.

1833
01:24:58.610 --> 01:25:00.953
It’s just the way
of the world.

1834
01:25:00.953 --> 01:25:02.053
You’re right. Noodle.

1835
01:25:02.053 --> 01:25:03.989
I guess that’s why
there’s one other thing to do.

1836
01:25:03.989 --> 01:25:07.652
- What’s that?
-  Change the world.

1837
01:25:10.391 --> 01:25:11.524
Whoa!

1838
01:25:12.932 --> 01:25:14.131
Where do we start?

1839
01:25:26.077 --> 01:25:27.375
’Scuse me. sir.

1840
01:25:27.375 --> 01:25:30.444
Could you spare
a piece of chocolate
for a starvin’ orphan?

1841
01:25:30.444 --> 01:25:34.954
I’m sorry. my child.
I don’t have any on me.

1842
01:25:34.954 --> 01:25:36.989
Oh.

1843
01:25:37.418 --> 01:25:40.388
Then have some acacia mints.

1844
01:25:41.092 --> 01:25:42.489
Yes!

1845
01:25:43.930 --> 01:25:47.098
"To Basil Bond.
employee of the week."

1846
01:25:47.098 --> 01:25:48.594
Oh. that’s lovely...

1847
01:26:00.045 --> 01:26:02.014
Everything all right
back there?

1848
01:26:02.014 --> 01:26:05.314
Everything’s fine.
Isn’t it. Abigail?

1849
01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:08.152
Tell her she might
want to duck.

1850
01:26:08.152 --> 01:26:10.484
Tell her she might
wanna what?

1851
01:26:10.484 --> 01:26:12.222
Duck!

1852
01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:16.325
Good morning. brethren.

1853
01:26:16.325 --> 01:26:17.656
Good morning. Father.

1854
01:26:17.656 --> 01:26:19.163
Now. as you all know.

1855
01:26:19.163 --> 01:26:22.397
it’s Baron von
Schmeichelhammer’s
funeral today.

1856
01:26:22.397 --> 01:26:25.433
And his widow is...

1857
01:26:25.433 --> 01:26:28.106
a bit of a pious type.
-  Ugh!

1858
01:26:28.106 --> 01:26:29.635
So. I don’t want
to see anyone

1859
01:26:29.635 --> 01:26:32.209
eating chocolate
during the service.

1860
01:26:32.209 --> 01:26:34.046
Yes. Father.

1861
01:26:34.046 --> 01:26:35.146
We all know that one day.

1862
01:26:35.146 --> 01:26:37.181
we shall be judged
for our sins.

1863
01:26:37.181 --> 01:26:40.679
but it’s not going
to be today.

1864
01:26:40.679 --> 01:26:43.319
Amen.

1865
01:26:56.233 --> 01:26:58.268
There. there.

1866
01:26:58.268 --> 01:26:59.401

It’s an emergency.

You too. octopus.

1885

There’s a giraffe.
- What? Oh. yeah. I think

1886
01:27:47.218 --> 01:27:48.714
we did lose a giraffe.

1887
01:27:48.714 --> 01:27:50.320
Well. could you come
and get it?

1888
01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:53.818

A weak and wicked chocoholic!

1892
01:28:22.781 --> 01:28:23.815
Good morning. everyone.

1893
01:28:23.815 --> 01:28:26.785
Welcome
to St. Benedict’s.

1894
01:28:26.785 --> 01:28:30.459
Baroness.
I’m so sorry for your loss.

1895
01:28:30.459 --> 01:28:35.662
We’re just having a few
technical difficulties. um.

1896
01:28:35.662 --> 01:28:36.597
so you might want to pop

1898
01:28:40.667 --> 01:28:41.470
Ah. the cavalry.

1899
01:28:41.470 --> 01:28:45.342
Are you the cleric
who called about a giraffe?

1900
01:28:50.710 --> 01:28:52.778
All clear.

1901
01:29:17.704 --> 01:29:19.904
Huh. "Thanks
for all your hard work."

1902
01:29:19.904 --> 01:29:23.842
"Father Julius
and the Chocolate Cartel."

1903
01:29:23.842 --> 01:29:26.152
Oh. that’s nice.

1904
01:29:26.482 --> 01:29:27.153
Mmm.

1905

Here we are. Father.

1906
01:29:28.748 --> 01:29:30.288
- One giraffe.

1907
01:29:30.288 --> 01:29:32.554
Marvelous.
Thank you. thank you.

actually.

1916
01:29:58.448 --> 01:29:59.284
Hello?

1917
01:29:59.284 --> 01:30:01.616
Basil? It’s Gwennie.

You were right.

Cool.

spilled its load.

flamingos about these days.

Well.
hurry it along now. will you?

1926
01:30:42.789 --> 01:30:45.297
The town square
was closed this morning

1927
01:30:45.297 --> 01:30:48.234
after a bizarre incident
at the city cathedral.

1928
01:30:48.234 --> 01:30:51.798
Delaying the funeral
of noted philanthropist.

1929
01:30:51.798 --> 01:30:53.800
Baron von Schmeichelhammer.

1930
01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:55.802
In nomine Patris.

1931
01:30:55.802 --> 01:31:00.312
et Filii. et Spiritus Sancti.

1932
01:31:00.378 --> 01:31:01.676
Amen.

1933
01:31:05.581 --> 01:31:08.584
Sorry. I’d best get that.

1934
01:31:09.552 --> 01:31:11.521
- Hello. pulpit?
-  Father.

1935
01:31:11.521 --> 01:31:12.654
Everything all right there?

1936
01:31:12.654 --> 01:31:14.656
Oh. yes. Mr. Slugworth.

1937
01:31:14.656 --> 01:31:16.526
All tickety-boo.

1938
01:31:16.526 --> 01:31:17.461
At least. it is now.

1939
01:31:17.461 --> 01:31:19.023
- What do you mean by that?

1940
01:31:19.023 --> 01:31:20.728
Oh. we had a giraffe
in here earlier.

1941
01:31:20.728 --> 01:31:22.862
Had to clear the whole place
for about 20 minutes.

1942
01:31:22.862 --> 01:31:25.667
but everything’s
back to normal.

1943
01:31:27.570 --> 01:31:28.274
Hello?

1944
01:31:28.274 --> 01:31:30.936
Damn the flamingos.
Donovan! Floor it!

1945
01:31:30.936 --> 01:31:32.410
Yes. sir!

1946
01:31:35.446 --> 01:31:36.876
Idiot!

1947
01:31:40.418 --> 01:31:42.354
Anything?
- Nothing.

1948
01:31:42.354 --> 01:31:43.289
Well. keep looking.

1949
01:31:43.289 --> 01:31:44.422
It’s not in here. Willy.

1950
01:31:44.422 --> 01:31:45.786
But Abacus said
that it was here.

1951
01:31:45.786 --> 01:31:48.327
Abacus has been
in the Wash House
for the past four years.

1952
01:31:48.327 --> 01:31:49.856
Maybe all the scrubbing
has gone to his head.

1953
01:31:49.856 --> 01:31:54.498
’Cause all that’s down here
is just a bunch
of stupid old chocolate.

1954
01:32:09.447 --> 01:32:11.317
Willy. look!

1955
01:32:18.654 --> 01:32:19.952
We did it. Noodle.

1956
01:32:19.952 --> 01:32:22.394
- We got ’em.

1957
01:32:23.362 --> 01:32:25.859
Naughty. naughty.
Mr. Wonka.

1958
01:32:25.859 --> 01:32:29.401
You’ve caused us
quite a bit of trouble.

1959
01:32:29.401 --> 01:32:30.831
You and your urchin.

1960
01:32:30.831 --> 01:32:32.866
Yeah. but she’s not
just an urchin.

1961
01:32:32.866 --> 01:32:34.472
is she. Mr. Slugworth?

1962
01:32:35.902 --> 01:32:37.904
You’re family.

1963
01:32:37.970 --> 01:32:38.839
What?

1964
01:32:38.839 --> 01:32:41.644
What are you talking about.
Willy?

1965
01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:44.449
You know that ring. Noodle?

1966
01:32:44.449 --> 01:32:46.011
The one your parents gave you?

1967
01:32:46.011 --> 01:32:48.684
Mr. Slugworth has one
just like it.

1968
01:32:48.684 --> 01:32:50.983
Don’t you. Mr. Slugworth?

1969
01:32:50.983 --> 01:32:53.491
As a matter of fact. I do.

1970
01:32:53.491 --> 01:32:58.727
That belonged to my brother.
Zebedee.

1971
01:32:58.727 --> 01:32:59.761
Was he my father?

1972
01:32:59.761 --> 01:33:02.401
A hopeless romantic
is what he was.

1973
01:33:02.401 --> 01:33:04.997
Fell in love with
a common little bookworm.

1974
01:33:04.997 --> 01:33:06.900
died before
they could marry.

1975
01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:11.938
Leaving me sole heir
to the family fortune.

1976
01:33:12.411 --> 01:33:14.677
Or so I thought.

1977
01:33:14.677 --> 01:33:16.008
But nine months later.

1978
01:33:16.008 --> 01:33:17.944
your mother turned up
on my doorstep.

1979
01:33:17.944 --> 01:33:22.916
begging me to get a doctor
for her sick little newborn.

1980
01:33:23.015 --> 01:33:24.852
I said I would help.

1981
01:33:24.852 --> 01:33:27.052
But you didn’t.
Did you?

1982
01:33:27.052 --> 01:33:28.053
Oh. no.

1983
01:33:28.053 --> 01:33:30.924
Instead. you put me
down a laundry chute.

1984
01:33:30.924 --> 01:33:32.695
Bye-bye. baby.

1985
01:33:32.695 --> 01:33:34.994
Mrs. Scrubitt found me.

1986
01:33:34.994 --> 01:33:35.962
She saw the ring.

1987
01:33:35.962 --> 01:33:39.768
Thought it was an "N."
and called me Noodle.

1988
01:33:39.933 --> 01:33:40.868
But it wasn’t.

1989
01:33:40.868 --> 01:33:43.101
It was "Z." For Zebedee.

1990
01:33:43.101 --> 01:33:44.102
Well. quite.

1991
01:33:44.102 --> 01:33:46.973
When your mother returned.
I told her you had died.
-  Oh. no!

1992
01:33:46.973 --> 01:33:48.711
She was
heartbroken. of course.

1993
01:33:48.711 --> 01:33:50.515
But. uh. I gave her
a handful of sovereigns

1994
01:33:50.515 --> 01:33:53.980
and had her escorted
from my property.

1995
01:33:55.421 --> 01:33:57.588
What was her name?

1996
01:33:57.687 --> 01:33:58.655
Eh?

1997
01:33:58.655 --> 01:34:01.658
My mom. What was her name?

1998
01:34:02.428 --> 01:34:03.660
Ooh.

1999
01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:05.662
Let me see. Um...

2000
01:34:05.827 --> 01:34:08.533
No. I don’t think
I could remember that.

2001
01:34:08.533 --> 01:34:12.163
Sorry.
But you have to understand.

2002
01:34:12.163 --> 01:34:13.604
she was very poor.

2003
01:34:13.604 --> 01:34:16.002
- Sorry. Felix.

2004
01:34:16.002 --> 01:34:17.905
Her name was Dorothy.

2005
01:34:17.905 --> 01:34:21.007
Dorothy Smith.
It says so right here.

2006
01:34:21.106 --> 01:34:22.173
Dorothy?

2007
01:34:22.173 --> 01:34:23.680
Well. what do you know?

2008
01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:26.683
I guess you did teach me
to read after all.

2009
01:34:27.453 --> 01:34:29.180
Well.
this is all very touching.

2010
01:34:29.180 --> 01:34:30.819
but back to business.

2011
01:34:30.819 --> 01:34:31.985
We’ll take that. thank you.

2012
01:34:31.985 --> 01:34:35.791
How much chocolate
do you have at your factory.
Mr. Fickelgruber?

2013
01:34:35.791 --> 01:34:37.892
Oh. about 80.000 gallons.

2014
01:34:37.892 --> 01:34:40.059
- Prodnose?

2015
01:34:40.059 --> 01:34:40.994
Seventy-five?

2016
01:34:40.994 --> 01:34:43.469
And I’ve got 150.

2017
01:34:43.601 --> 01:34:45.471
That should be enough.

2018
01:34:45.471 --> 01:34:46.934
For what?

2019
01:34:47.033 --> 01:34:50.641
Death by chocolate.

2020
01:35:08.153 --> 01:35:10.056
On you go.

2021
01:35:28.074 --> 01:35:29.845
Uh. gentlemen.

2022
01:35:30.274 --> 01:35:31.583
Considering the situation.

2023
01:35:31.583 --> 01:35:34.817
I wondered if you’d do
a good deed on my behalf.

2024
01:35:34.817 --> 01:35:35.785
A what?

2025
01:35:35.785 --> 01:35:36.621
"A good deed."

2026
01:35:36.621 --> 01:35:39.019
It’s a sort of pointless act
of selflessness...

2027
01:35:39.019 --> 01:35:41.527
Yes. of course. Mr. Wonka.

2028
01:35:41.527 --> 01:35:42.957
What would you like us to do?

2029
01:35:42.957 --> 01:35:46.598
I was wondering if you could
give this to someone.

2030
01:35:46.796 --> 01:35:48.831
Only if you happen to see him.

2031
01:35:48.831 --> 01:35:49.667
And who is it?

2032
01:35:49.667 --> 01:35:52.197
A little orange man.
- Eh?

2033
01:35:52.197 --> 01:35:53.836
A little orange man.

2034
01:35:53.836 --> 01:35:54.771
About eight inches high.

2035
01:35:54.771 --> 01:35:56.201
with orange skin
and bright green hair.

2036
01:35:56.201 --> 01:35:59.743
I owe him a jar of chocolates.
you see. And. well.

2037
01:35:59.743 --> 01:36:03.010
I think these might be
the best I ever made.

2038
01:36:03.010 --> 01:36:03.945
Well. in that case.

2039
01:36:03.945 --> 01:36:07.113
I’ll make sure
he gets them personally.

2040
01:36:11.216 --> 01:36:13.592
Farewell. Mr. Wonka.

2041
01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:15.924
Urchin.

2042
01:36:26.869 --> 01:36:30.070
-  Willy...

2043
01:36:54.798 --> 01:36:56.294
What are we gonna do. Willy?

2044
01:36:56.294 --> 01:37:00.331
I don’t know. Noodle.
I’ll think of something.

2045
01:37:06.370 --> 01:37:08.680
Best chocolate
he ever made. eh?

2046
01:37:10.979 --> 01:37:12.915
Whoo-hoo.
- Oh!

2047
01:37:14.213 --> 01:37:15.115
I got it!

2048
01:37:15.115 --> 01:37:17.051
What is it?
Did you think of something?

2049
01:37:17.051 --> 01:37:17.986
Yes. I did.

2050
01:37:17.986 --> 01:37:19.625
If we’re gonna drown
in chocolate. Noodle.

2051
01:37:19.625 --> 01:37:22.089
and let’s face it. we’re gonna
drown in chocolate.

2052
01:37:22.089 --> 01:37:23.387
then it’s gonna
be Wonka chocolate.

2053
01:37:23.387 --> 01:37:26.830
We’re not gonna drown. Willy.
Look. there’s a light.

2054
01:37:26.830 --> 01:37:29.096
We’ll let the chocolate
lift us up.

2055
01:37:29.096 --> 01:37:30.295
we’ll bang on the glass.

2056
01:37:30.295 --> 01:37:32.902
and pray somebody hears us.

2057
01:37:32.902 --> 01:37:35.168
That’s a much better idea.

2058
01:37:37.203 --> 01:37:38.039
Ah. gentlemen.

2059
01:37:38.039 --> 01:37:40.272
It was a bit of a close shave
this morning.

2060
01:37:40.272 --> 01:37:41.812
and I was wondering if perhaps

2061
01:37:41.812 --> 01:37:45.684
we could rethink
our arrangement. Or...

2062
01:37:47.015 --> 01:37:51.184
Or... just leave things
as they are.

2063
01:37:51.184 --> 01:37:53.054
Father.

2064
01:37:53.153 --> 01:37:55.287
Well. Wonka might be as nutty
as a fruitcake.

2065
01:37:55.287 --> 01:37:56.959
but he sure knew
how to make chocolate.

2066
01:37:56.959 --> 01:37:58.356
Mmm.
- But do you think

2067
01:37:58.356 --> 01:38:01.029
we should have saved some
for the Little Orange Man?

2068
01:38:01.029 --> 01:38:02.129
Tell me you’re joking.

2069
01:38:02.129 --> 01:38:05.330
Uh. yes. Yes. I am.
Sorry. why am I?

2070
01:38:05.330 --> 01:38:07.068
Because
there’s no such thing

2071
01:38:07.068 --> 01:38:10.401
as a little orange man.
ya nincompoop.

2072
01:38:12.678 --> 01:38:14.680
Help!
Help!

2073
01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:16.176
Somebody help. please!

2074
01:38:16.176 --> 01:38:17.947
Please help!
- Help!

2075
01:38:17.947 --> 01:38:20.818
Look. Look.
somebody’s coming. Look.

2076
01:38:20.818 --> 01:38:23.150
Willy. we’re saved!

2077
01:38:35.261 --> 01:38:38.803
I’m sorry. Noodle.
- Don’t be.

2078
01:38:38.935 --> 01:38:41.168
You found my family.

2079
01:38:41.168 --> 01:38:43.973
A mom who loved me.

2080
01:38:43.973 --> 01:38:46.778
That’s all I ever wanted.

2081
01:38:48.043 --> 01:38:49.946
Deep breath now.

2082
01:39:03.190 --> 01:39:06.765
Mmm! Exquisite.

2083
01:39:06.765 --> 01:39:09.460
You mustn’t let yourself
get so worked up.

2084
01:39:09.460 --> 01:39:11.429
It’s just a bit of chocolate.

2085
01:39:11.429 --> 01:39:13.398
-  Correction.

2086
01:39:13.398 --> 01:39:17.743
It was actually my chocolate.

2087
01:39:23.375 --> 01:39:27.247
You have made
a very grave error. gentlemen.

2088
01:39:27.247 --> 01:39:29.480
You steal from
an Oompa Loompa.

2089
01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:30.789
we take back

2090
01:39:30.789 --> 01:39:32.516
a thousandfold.

2091
01:39:39.864 --> 01:39:41.965
What’s going on. Willy?

2092
01:39:42.064 --> 01:39:44.132
It’s draining. Noodle.

2093
01:39:44.132 --> 01:39:46.002
We’ve been saved!

2094
01:39:46.002 --> 01:39:49.038
- By who?
- I don’t know.

2095
01:39:49.104 --> 01:39:51.777
By the Little Orange Man!

2096
01:39:51.777 --> 01:39:52.503
- Look.
- Wh...

2097
01:39:52.503 --> 01:39:54.274
The Little Orange Man!

2098
01:39:54.274 --> 01:39:57.079
Thank you.
Little Orange Man! Thank you!

2099
01:40:20.201 --> 01:40:23.105
Gentlemen.
Thank goodness you’re okay.

2100
01:40:23.105 --> 01:40:25.371
I came as fast as I could.

2101
01:40:33.379 --> 01:40:35.117
Whew! Car shrunk.

2102
01:40:35.117 --> 01:40:36.184
I’m sure it did.

2103
01:40:36.184 --> 01:40:38.252
And you’ve nothing
to worry about. Chief.

2104
01:40:38.252 --> 01:40:39.187
All under control.

2105
01:40:39.187 --> 01:40:40.584
A couple of thieves broke in.
but I’m afraid

2106
01:40:40.584 --> 01:40:44.093
they met with a little...
accident.

2107
01:40:44.093 --> 01:40:46.997
In which they died.

2108
01:40:47.932 --> 01:40:49.461
That’s actually
rather good. Gerald.

2109
01:40:49.461 --> 01:40:51.100
I wouldn’t be
so sure about that.

2110
01:40:51.100 --> 01:40:53.971
Officer. would you kindly
take a look at this?

2111
01:40:53.971 --> 01:40:54.466
Wonka!

2112
01:40:54.466 --> 01:40:56.204
It details
every single illegal payment

2113
01:40:56.204 --> 01:40:58.107
these men have ever made.

2114
01:40:58.107 --> 01:40:59.009
Thousands of them.

2115
01:40:59.009 --> 01:41:01.539
Affable. don’t listen
to her. She’s lyin’.

2116
01:41:01.539 --> 01:41:03.882
Well. of course she is.

2117
01:41:03.882 --> 01:41:05.345
She’s not. sir.

2118
01:41:05.345 --> 01:41:07.512
She’s absolutely right.

2119
01:41:07.578 --> 01:41:09.316
It’s incredible.

2120
01:41:09.481 --> 01:41:10.548
Oh. Well.

2121
01:41:10.548 --> 01:41:12.352
Then that sounds like a case

2122
01:41:12.352 --> 01:41:13.584
for the Chief of Police.

2123
01:41:13.584 --> 01:41:16.895
So you give it to me. Affable.
I’ll. uh...
I’ll take it off your hands.

2124
01:41:16.895 --> 01:41:18.292
You know.
save you the paperwork.

2125
01:41:18.292 --> 01:41:20.228
I can’t do that.
I’m afraid. sir.

2126
01:41:20.228 --> 01:41:21.196
Why’s that?

2127
01:41:21.196 --> 01:41:24.001
Because your name
is written down here.

2128
01:41:24.001 --> 01:41:24.496
Huh?

2129
01:41:24.496 --> 01:41:26.003
- A lot.
- Gentlemen...

2130
01:41:26.003 --> 01:41:27.873
-  You’re under arrest.
-  Run.

2131
01:41:27.873 --> 01:41:29.237
We puttin’
handcuffs on. here?

2132
01:41:29.237 --> 01:41:30.469
- That’s okay. Noodle.

2133
01:41:30.469 --> 01:41:32.141
Give it one second.

2134
01:41:34.176 --> 01:41:36.145
What’s happening?

2135
01:41:36.145 --> 01:41:37.080
Why are we airborne?

2136
01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:38.576
You didn’t eat
any of those chocolates.

2137
01:41:38.576 --> 01:41:40.545
did you. Mr. Slugworth?
- Why?

2138
01:41:40.545 --> 01:41:42.052
Because
they’re Hoverchocs.

2139
01:41:42.052 --> 01:41:44.285
Delayed action.
but extra strong.

2140
01:41:44.285 --> 01:41:46.221
You think you’re
very clever. don’t you. Wonka?

2141
01:41:46.221 --> 01:41:50.159
Well. there’s a billion
sovereigns of chocolate
beneath our feet.

2142
01:41:50.159 --> 01:41:51.226
We’ll get the best lawyers.

2143
01:41:51.226 --> 01:41:54.196
bribe the judge.
rig the jury if we have to.

2144
01:41:54.196 --> 01:41:56.231
We’ll be fine.

2145
01:41:56.231 --> 01:41:58.904
I wish I’d thought of that.

2146
01:42:01.566 --> 01:42:03.271
Hey. Noodle!

2147
01:42:21.124 --> 01:42:22.059
What is that?

2148
01:42:22.059 --> 01:42:23.423
It’s our chocolate!

2149
01:42:23.423 --> 01:42:25.425
All our chocolate!

2150
01:42:25.425 --> 01:42:26.360
We’re ruined!

2151
01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:27.966
Hey. don’t worry. gentlemen.

2152
01:42:27.966 --> 01:42:30.463
You’ll come down eventually.

2153
01:42:30.463 --> 01:42:33.565
Probably. I think.

2154
01:42:33.565 --> 01:42:35.600
But until then.

2155
01:42:35.699 --> 01:42:38.174
ladies and gentlemen.

2156
01:42:38.174 --> 01:42:41.947
Willy Wonka and friends...

2157
01:42:41.947 --> 01:42:45.247
...invite you
to enjoy our chocolate.

2158
01:42:45.247 --> 01:42:48.712
Yay! Magic Wonka!

2159
01:42:51.616 --> 01:42:53.156
Gwennie?

2160
01:42:53.156 --> 01:42:55.422
Basil!

2161
01:42:55.620 --> 01:42:56.962
What did I say. Abacus.

2162
01:42:56.962 --> 01:42:59.393
I told you
we could fix it all.

2163
01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:18.511
Your cup.

2164
01:43:18.676 --> 01:43:19.545
Thank you.

2165
01:43:19.545 --> 01:43:21.052
- There you are.
-  There you go.

2166
01:43:21.052 --> 01:43:22.317
Careful. not too much.

2167
01:43:22.317 --> 01:43:23.681
Okay.

2168
01:45:00.844 --> 01:45:04.650
Mmm.
- Oh. thank you.

2169
01:45:04.650 --> 01:45:05.750
Thank you.

2170
01:45:05.750 --> 01:45:08.291
Mmm.
Thank you.

2171
01:45:08.291 --> 01:45:10.821
Mmm.
-  Oh.

2172
01:45:19.533 --> 01:45:21.172
Huh.

2173
01:45:23.768 --> 01:45:28.212
So...
how does it feel. Willy?

2174
01:45:28.278 --> 01:45:30.709
Is it as good as you remember?

2175
01:45:31.512 --> 01:45:33.316
Every little bit.

2176
01:45:36.451 --> 01:45:38.849
I wish it could last forever.

2177
01:45:44.591 --> 01:45:46.593
I guess it’s time.

2178
01:45:48.133 --> 01:45:48.760
Time for what?

2179
01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:53.204
Do you know
how many people in this city
are named D. Smith?

2180
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:54.205
106.

2181
01:45:54.205 --> 01:45:57.340
And luckily. you have
a friend who works
at the telephone exchange.

2182
01:45:57.340 --> 01:45:59.870
And she spent
the entire afternoon

2183
01:45:59.870 --> 01:46:01.476
ringing around.

2184
01:46:01.476 --> 01:46:03.445
And guess what?

2185
01:46:04.380 --> 01:46:06.184
We found her.

2186
01:46:06.481 --> 01:46:07.713
You found my mom?

2187
01:46:07.713 --> 01:46:10.518
She works
in the library.

2188
01:46:11.321 --> 01:46:13.422
That’s where she lives.

2189
01:46:14.687 --> 01:46:16.590

So goes a good deed

2209
01:47:58.593 --> 01:47:59.693
in a weary world.

2210
01:47:59.693 --> 01:48:01.761
I was wondering
if I’d see you again.

2211
01:48:01.761 --> 01:48:03.862
I’m not going anywhere.
Willy Wonka.

2212
01:48:03.862 --> 01:48:05.798
Not until you’ve
paid your debt.

2213
01:48:05.798 --> 01:48:07.272
Now. I know you tried.

2214
01:48:07.272 --> 01:48:10.308
Loompa law is very clear
on this subject.

2215
01:48:10.308 --> 01:48:10.902
Until such time

2216
01:48:10.902 --> 01:48:14.675
as the chocolate is physically
in my hand...

2217
01:48:15.775 --> 01:48:17.414
Oh. Thank you.

2218
01:48:17.414 --> 01:48:20.417
Thank you. For saving my life.

2219
01:48:21.011 --> 01:48:22.980
Well. I suppose
that concludes our business.

2220
01:48:22.980 --> 01:48:25.851
I will now return
to my beloved Loompaland.

2221
01:48:25.851 --> 01:48:30.724
Where the cocoa beans grow in
disappointingly small numbers.

2222
01:48:30.724 --> 01:48:32.429
and my friends
look down on me.

2223
01:48:32.429 --> 01:48:34.662
What? I thought
they called you Lofty.

2224
01:48:34.662 --> 01:48:37.896
The truth is that
I am a quarter-inch

2225
01:48:37.896 --> 01:48:39.931
below average.

2226
01:48:39.931 --> 01:48:41.471
They call me Shorty-pants.

2227
01:48:41.471 --> 01:48:43.704
- But there it is.

2228
01:48:43.704 --> 01:48:44.936
Good day to you. sir.

2229
01:48:44.936 --> 01:48:47.609
Uh. it’s a shame
you have to go.

2230
01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:48.643
I said good day.

2231
01:48:48.643 --> 01:48:50.678
If I’m gonna share
my chocolate with the world.

2232
01:48:50.678 --> 01:48:52.416
I’m gonna need
more than a shop.

2233
01:48:52.416 --> 01:48:53.384
I’m sure you will.

2234
01:48:53.384 --> 01:48:54.418
I’m gonna need a factory.

2235
01:48:54.418 --> 01:48:55.914

2236
01:48:55.914 --> 01:48:58.917
