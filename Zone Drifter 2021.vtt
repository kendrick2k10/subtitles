3
00:00:10.768 --> 00:00:13.935
(intense synth music)

4
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:24.316
(haunting music)

5
00:01:10.288 --> 00:01:11.788
(explosion booms)

6
00:01:11.788 --> 00:01:14.205
(man groans)

7
00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:15.988
- Hey!

8
00:01:15.988 --> 00:01:16.821
Come on!

9
00:01:18.883 --> 00:01:20.423
I need you right here.

10
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.983
Okay.

11
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.633
We're gonna storm that bunker.

12
00:01:41.872 --> 00:01:45.539
If you move fast enough.
they won't see you.

13
00:01:47.827 --> 00:01:50.994
(intense synth music)

14
00:01:55.477 --> 00:01:56.890
Go!

15
00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.390
(guns firing)

16
00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:04.796
(intense synth music)

17
00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:55.297
- I'm out.

18
00:02:55.297 --> 00:02:56.630
I'm out of ammo!

19
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.810
(guns firing)

20
00:03:04.196 --> 00:03:06.696
(tense music)

21
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.700
When the armies of Victoria and Seattle

22
00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.493
attacked our western borders.

23
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.743
we fought together on the front lines.

24
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.650
Wave after wave of infantry

25
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.863
smashed their way through our defenses.

26
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.303
The Sons kept in constant formation.

27
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.460
sweeping the streets.

28
00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.043
burning and grinding the gears of war.

29
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.423
When our squad was hit by an ambush.

30
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:30.273
he gained rank and became a guiding force.

31
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.563
We dug in. put our faith in him.

32
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.973
For days they rained down
small arms and firebombs.

33
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.743
But because of him. we made it through.

34
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.370
But not without consequence.

35
00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.683
He was captured and tortured.

36
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.633
By the time we found him.
he was never the same.

37
00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:02.593
War had changed him.

38
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.903
I didn't see the madness
building in his eyes.

39
00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.243
or the hate.

40
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.543
When I look back now. I can see it.

41
00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.582
Sergeant Merle Ramses of
the Intercontinental Army.

42
00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.003
He was my brother.

43
00:06:27.644 --> 00:06:30.590
Him and his men left me with nothing

44
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.363
but a set of footprints
leading into the wastes.

45
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.183
I'd say he has at least 30
men with him. maybe more.

46
00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.693
While I was in the army.

47
00:06:45.323 --> 00:06:48.803
I heard rumors of a
massive radiation signature

48
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.243
coming from way out deep.

49
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.397
He was always consumed with the idea

50
00:06:56.054 --> 00:06:57.654
of some kind of hydrogen weapon.

51
00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.523
However. by the sources I've seen.

52
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.733
it could be something much more powerful.

53
00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:19.619
(dramatic synth music)

54
00:07:39.113 --> 00:07:41.780
(woman screams)

55
00:08:21.091 --> 00:08:24.341
This looks like the work of my brother.

56
00:08:25.288 --> 00:08:28.038
I'm getting close. I can feel it.

57
00:08:32.142 --> 00:08:35.392
(dramatic synth music)

58
00:09:47.043 --> 00:09:50.293
(man breathes heavily)

59
00:09:57.093 --> 00:09:59.753
(owl hoots)

60
00:09:59.753 --> 00:10:02.253
(tense music)

61
00:10:08.879 --> 00:10:11.212
(gun fires)

62
00:10:18.763 --> 00:10:20.780
Where's Ramses?

63
00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.073
- Ramses over there.

64
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:23.873
Ramses dead.

65
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:28.313
- Now I'm sure you've noticed.

66
00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:33.728
I'm not a man to play games.

67
00:10:33.728 --> 00:10:35.187
You wouldn't like that.

68
00:10:35.187 --> 00:10:37.753
(man groans)

69
00:10:37.753 --> 00:10:39.003
I won't kill you quickly.

70
00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.776
You wouldn't like that.

71
00:10:41.776 --> 00:10:42.690
(man coughs)

72
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:44.163
It's gonna fester.

73
00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.533
take a couple days to work through you.

74
00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.130
Chances are it'll call the carrions.

75
00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:03.440
or you can lay out here
and cook in the sun.

76
00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.943
Your best bet is to tell
me where my brother is.

77
00:11:16.345 --> 00:11:19.360
and I'll see about making a
quicker road to hell for you.

78
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.340
- I don't know.

79
00:11:24.679 --> 00:11:26.383
He went into the desert.

80
00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:33.533
I heard stories if you go
that way. you don't come back.

81
00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:43.183
Now kill me. you son of a bitch.

82
00:11:43.183 --> 00:11:44.016
(man spits)

83
00:11:44.016 --> 00:11:44.849
Kill me!

84
00:11:48.492 --> 00:11:49.820
- If you don't have any objections with me

85
00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.773
taking a look at that kid over there.

86
00:11:55.084 --> 00:11:57.890
I don't think you'll
be needing it with you.

87
00:11:57.890 --> 00:11:58.850
Die. law.

88
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:04.963
- You're one man.

89
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.593
He's got a fuckin' army.

90
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.123
You don't stand a chance.

91
00:12:13.078 --> 00:12:15.495
(man coughs)

92
00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:21.572
You know that wife of yours?

93
00:12:26.024 --> 00:12:28.607
(glass breaks)

94
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:31.533
She begged me.

95
00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.240
She begged me to stop.

96
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:44.643
She said your name. I
don't know how many times.

97
00:12:46.644 --> 00:12:49.311
(intense music)

98
00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:31.737
(ominous music)

99
00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:43.563
- [Travis] I wonder what the hell

100
00:13:43.563 --> 00:13:44.883
could bring them out this far.

101
00:13:47.256 --> 00:13:49.023
I can't say I care much what it is.

102
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:53.240
But the plot points on this map

103
00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.083
leads straight into no man's land.

104
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:57.583
deep into the waste.

105
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.910
Hundreds of miles of nothing
but heartache and desperation.

106
00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:05.713
To lead his men into
that kind of wilderness.

107
00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.163
he must want it bad.

108
00:14:09.163 --> 00:14:11.496
(gun fires)

109
00:14:21.367 --> 00:14:24.034
(intense music)

110
00:14:25.967 --> 00:14:28.467
(guns firing)

111
00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:28.560
There's too many of them.

112
00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:30.970
We need to retreat.

113
00:15:38.453 --> 00:15:40.530
- I don't know.

114
00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:42.923
- I've got a family. a wife.

115
00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:45.123
Let's fall back.

116
00:15:51.113 --> 00:15:51.946
Merle!

117
00:15:55.623 --> 00:15:57.956
(gun fires)

118
00:16:01.452 --> 00:16:04.119
(intense music)

119
00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:28.260
- The great fire painted
the skies a crimson shade

120
00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.483
leaving charred remains at my feet.

121
00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:40.723
I realized this nation was doomed to fail.

122
00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:43.163
but I kept fighting.

123
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:48.813
We had sworn an oath to
the Intercontinental Army.

124
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:57.150
Then news came. the Sons were
moving towards my hometown.

125
00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.673
sweeping and murdering a few cities away.

126
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:06.123
I had no choice.

127
00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:12.723
I had to desert the army and find my wife.

128
00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.542
My brother didn't see it that way.

129
00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.772
His eyes were on fire when I left.

130
00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:31.303
I begged him to come with me.

131
00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:34.758
and he called me a coward.

132
00:17:34.758 --> 00:17:36.800
We're out here alone. we gotta go!

133
00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.833
I told him if he changed his mind.

134
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:41.563
he knew where to find me.

135
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:47.293
He said nothing. and watched me go.

136
00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.583
By the time I broke
free from the maelstrom.

137
00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.013
most of our platoon was dead.

138
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:59.703
and our army was crumbling.

139
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.293
After years had gone by.

140
00:18:06.669 --> 00:18:08.393
I thought I had lost my brother.

141
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.400
Another casualty to a war
that changed the world.

142
00:18:15.717 --> 00:18:19.073
And that became the seeds for his revenge.

143
00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:22.683
I paid a terrible price.

144
00:18:24.663 --> 00:18:27.330
(ominous music)

145
00:20:12.448 --> 00:20:15.781
(man speaking on radio)

146
00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:35.003
(man yells)
(guns firing)

147
00:20:44.607 --> 00:20:47.274
(intense music)

148
00:21:14.453 --> 00:21:16.786
(man yells)

149
00:21:19.693 --> 00:21:22.026
(gun fires)

150
00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:36.363
(Travis yells)

151
00:22:00.227 --> 00:22:02.644
(man groans)

152
00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.903
These cannibals. wild men.

153
00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:14.893
Growing up after the fires of war.

154
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:18.730
No sense of decency left.

155
00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:20.873
just scavengers of an old world.

156
00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:26.707
The chances of me walking
out of this just plummeted.

157
00:22:37.192 --> 00:22:40.192
(melancholic music)

158
00:22:44.955 --> 00:22:48.406
(Hannah laughs)

159
00:22:48.406 --> 00:22:51.116
(glass breaks)

160
00:22:51.116 --> 00:22:53.314
(gun fires)

161
00:22:53.314 --> 00:22:56.064
(haunting music)

162
00:23:23.587 --> 00:23:25.703
I went searching for my wife.

163
00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:30.583
War had left nothing but
death and ash in its wake.

164
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:38.470
I knew that there is a slim
chance I would find her alive.

165
00:23:43.082 --> 00:23:46.290
And I had made a promise
to Hannah years prior.

166
00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:52.283
If she was still alive. I
knew where she would be.

167
00:23:54.828 --> 00:23:56.553
- [Hannah] Travis?

168
00:23:56.553 --> 00:24:01.344
- When I found her. I held her so tight.

169
00:24:01.344 --> 00:24:04.007
I wish that moment could last forever.

170
00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:08.813
Out of all the destruction.

171
00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:10.860
I had her to hold on to.

172
00:24:12.148 --> 00:24:14.743
I could see all the loss
Hannah had been through.

173
00:24:16.273 --> 00:24:19.413
The death of so many
people that she had loved.

174
00:24:20.583 --> 00:24:23.860
I told her about my father's cabin.

175
00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:25.463
how we could start a new life.

176
00:24:28.175 --> 00:24:31.367
I saw the hope once
again return to her eyes.

177
00:24:33.935 --> 00:24:36.518
(crows cawing)

178
00:24:38.531 --> 00:24:41.781
(dramatic synth music)

179
00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:12.480
All right.

180
00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.493
I'm backing up.

181
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:19.380
- Yeah. keep backing up
and throw them guns down.

182
00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:20.280
- I can't do that.

183
00:25:21.391 --> 00:25:23.630
Not while you have that
shooter pointed at me.

184
00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:25.063
- Why are you following us?

185
00:25:26.407 --> 00:25:27.730
- "Us"?

186
00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:28.627
Who else is out here with you?

187
00:25:28.627 --> 00:25:31.000
- Me and the cat. smart guy.

188
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.240
Why are you following us?

189
00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.130
- To tell you the truth.

190
00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:36.830
I didn't know who I was following.

191
00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:40.180
You dragging around that cat carrier

192
00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:43.130
makes a mighty strange track.

193
00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:44.190
I didn't know what I'd find.

194
00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:45.940
- I think I'm just gonna shoot you.

195
00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:47.190
- Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

196
00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:50.433
All right. look.

197
00:25:51.881 --> 00:25:53.131
The way I got it figured.

198
00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:56.963
is you got me dead before
I raise my barrel up.

199
00:25:58.009 --> 00:26:00.860
But you'll also notice
I also have my shooter

200
00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:03.190
pointed right at Mr. Kitty over there.

201
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:04.623
- Stay away from that cat!

202
00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:09.500
- Now. I'll be backing off.

203
00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:13.110
I was just curious. is all.

204
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:15.160
I haven't seen very many people out here.

205
00:26:17.216 --> 00:26:20.123
I don't suppose you tell
me who the hell you are

206
00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:24.410
and how you've been surviving out here?

207
00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:28.113
I didn't think so.

208
00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:30.163
I'll be on my way.

209
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:35.103
I'll leave your gun up
on the top of the hill.

210
00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:39.263
- You're just leaving?

211
00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:41.513
- Yup.

212
00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.390
- [Cat Lady] Where are you going?

213
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:48.603
- I'm looking for someone.
and you're not them.

214
00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:51.100
So I'll be on my way.

215
00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:52.600
- I'm looking for someone too.

216
00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:58.083
My sister. she disappeared
a couple days ago.

217
00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:00.763
There's a town up north.

218
00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:04.950
maybe the someone you're
looking for is there too.

219
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:06.100
- That town isn't safe.

220
00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:09.780
They'll gut you and not
think twice about it.

221
00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:13.547
You'd be wise to steer
clear of that hellhole.

222
00:27:13.547 --> 00:27:15.083
- But what about my sister?

223
00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:18.930
- What does she look like?

224
00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:21.173
- Really pretty with blond hair.

225
00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:24.363
I have a photo.

226
00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:35.983
- I did see someone like
this a couple days back.

227
00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.750
There was nothing I
could do for them though.

228
00:27:41.788 --> 00:27:42.938
They were already dead.

229
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:47.600
- Are you just saying that

230
00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:48.993
to get a rise out of me?

231
00:27:51.969 --> 00:27:53.052
- Afraid not.

232
00:27:55.149 --> 00:27:56.732
Her throat was cut.

233
00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.763
Looked like it was a
mercy when it happened.

234
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:03.703
I'm sorry.

235
00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:20.990
She was as out of place

236
00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:23.183
as the tracks she was leaving in the sand.

237
00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:27.630
It would've been a mercy
to put a bullet in her.

238
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.223
save her from the agony that lies ahead.

239
00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:35.663
Her supplies might have been useful.

240
00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:38.663
or a waste of a bullet.

241
00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:44.340
Anyone dumb enough to
aimlessly wander the desert

242
00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:45.963
will surely pay the price.

243
00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:52.160
It's a wonder that she's lasted this long.

244
00:28:53.342 --> 00:28:56.092
(dramatic music)

245
00:29:34.893 --> 00:29:37.773
When my mind drifts like worried fire.

246
00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:41.223
I always go back to that place.

247
00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:43.673
It comforts me.

248
00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:48.220
My chair. my favorite coffee mug.

249
00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:50.420
the way that picture would sit crooked

250
00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:52.338
on the way to our bed.

251
00:29:52.338 --> 00:29:54.110
The sound of the pine trees

252
00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:55.633
that would sway in the breeze.

253
00:29:57.432 --> 00:29:58.800
(Hannah chuckles)

254
00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.210
I memorized that place.

255
00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:02.213
Every inch of it.

256
00:30:04.494 --> 00:30:06.960
I walked those steps in my mind

257
00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.213
over and over again.

258
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:14.813
That lovely island of isolation
high in the mountains.

259
00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:18.143
Where we made a life for ourselves.

260
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:21.633
One filled with love and hope.

261
00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.283
Five years passed.

262
00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:28.363
My wife gave birth to our son.

263
00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:33.483
After all this world had shown me.

264
00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:38.766
I knew I had found my way home.

265
00:30:38.766 --> 00:30:41.433
(hopeful music)

266
00:30:47.505 --> 00:30:50.005
(guns firing)

267
00:30:55.929 --> 00:30:58.512
(Hannah yells)

268
00:31:02.134 --> 00:31:03.217
I'm so sorry.

269
00:31:06.435 --> 00:31:07.711
(glass breaks)

270
00:31:07.711 --> 00:31:10.716
(Travis yells)

271
00:31:10.716 --> 00:31:12.371
(baby cries)

272
00:31:12.371 --> 00:31:14.704
(gun fires)

273
00:31:15.971 --> 00:31:18.554
(Travis yells)

274
00:31:20.316 --> 00:31:23.233
(mysterious music)

275
00:31:33.612 --> 00:31:34.445
No. no!

276
00:31:36.351 --> 00:31:38.851
(tense music)

277
00:32:27.334 --> 00:32:31.803
I'd give anything to kill
the pain in this arm.

278
00:32:32.723 --> 00:32:36.433
A shot of whisky. a mercy bullet.

279
00:32:38.295 --> 00:32:40.212
The fever's setting in.

280
00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:42.773
I'd lost the trail.

281
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:47.580
and I'm not sure if I'm anywhere close

282
00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:49.080
to the coordinates on the map.

283
00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:53.570
Lost in the desert.

284
00:32:55.705 --> 00:32:57.649
I can't focus.

285
00:32:57.649 --> 00:32:59.949
I've been seeing double
for the last two days.

286
00:33:00.823 --> 00:33:05.010
And I'm just guessing at this point.

287
00:33:07.913 --> 00:33:11.280
A compass is all that separates me

288
00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:13.483
from being buried out here in the sand.

289
00:33:15.917 --> 00:33:17.803
And it's no longer pointing north.

290
00:33:22.012 --> 00:33:24.720
The pain shoots through
my body with each step.

291
00:33:25.942 --> 00:33:30.280
A shriveled nose. cracked
eyes meet with blood.

292
00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:31.893
face down in the dirt.

293
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.937
This is what lies ahead.

294
00:33:36.867 --> 00:33:38.960
It won't be long now.

295
00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.710
(dramatic music)

296
00:34:17.786 --> 00:34:22.703
(gun fires)
(glass breaks)

297
00:34:39.735 --> 00:34:40.735
I thought...

298
00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:45.683
We gave up on following each other.

299
00:34:52.947 --> 00:34:56.201
I could just shoot you right now

300
00:34:56.201 --> 00:34:57.483
and get it over with.

301
00:34:58.882 --> 00:35:00.213
- What happened to you?

302
00:35:01.097 --> 00:35:02.233
Are you sick?

303
00:35:05.203 --> 00:35:06.803
(Travis grunts)

304
00:35:06.803 --> 00:35:07.636
- Okay.

305
00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:16.293
- That wound on your arm is infected.

306
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:19.610
You should really let me help you.

307
00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:26.620
I'm sure you know what this is.

308
00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:28.793
I'll help you under one condition.

309
00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.470
You give me some of what
you were eating last night.

310
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:33.883
it smelled pretty good.

311
00:35:38.684 --> 00:35:42.101
- It's scrawny. but it'll fill the belly.

312
00:35:44.881 --> 00:35:45.903
You build the fire.

313
00:35:54.818 --> 00:35:56.318
Thank you. Hannah.

314
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:16.493
Let's start by heading towards
those mountains over there.

315
00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:20.673
Go until you find the river.

316
00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:23.110
and then follow it downstream.

317
00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:26.980
- Why would I want to do that?

318
00:36:28.413 --> 00:36:30.583
- Because you're bound to find somebody.

319
00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:33.013
- I already found someone.

320
00:36:36.251 --> 00:36:39.501
(dramatic synth music)

321
00:37:06.141 --> 00:37:08.569
- What are you doing here?

322
00:37:08.569 --> 00:37:10.019
- I decided to come this way.

323
00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:12.733
- I'm going this way.

324
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:24.400
- Purely coincidence we're both here.

325
00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:26.583
- Is that so?

326
00:37:29.073 --> 00:37:32.323
(dramatic synth music)

327
00:38:01.534 --> 00:38:02.367
Hold up.

328
00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:05.553
Don't come up here.

329
00:38:18.689 --> 00:38:19.689
- Oh my God.

330
00:38:21.892 --> 00:38:23.059
What happened?

331
00:38:24.248 --> 00:38:25.748
- I'm not certain.

332
00:38:27.127 --> 00:38:29.450
But this certainly looks
like the work of men

333
00:38:30.465 --> 00:38:31.865
that I'm aiming to run into.

334
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:35.820
- What do you want with such people?

335
00:38:37.844 --> 00:38:42.844
(guns firing)
(intense music)

336
00:38:44.289 --> 00:38:45.882
- It's a trap!

337
00:38:45.882 --> 00:38:48.000
(gun fires)

338
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:48.833
Go. go!

339
00:38:51.021 --> 00:38:53.354
(gun fires)

340
00:39:05.845 --> 00:39:07.501
I can't do it.

341
00:39:07.501 --> 00:39:08.445
- What?

342
00:39:08.445 --> 00:39:09.362
What is it?

343
00:39:11.837 --> 00:39:16.067
- When I say. you shoot that gun of yours.

344
00:39:16.067 --> 00:39:17.763
You got me?

345
00:39:17.763 --> 00:39:18.599
You got me?

346
00:39:18.599 --> 00:39:20.153
- Yeah. yeah.

347
00:39:20.153 --> 00:39:21.736
- Switch positions.

348
00:39:24.849 --> 00:39:26.449
Get over me. now.

349
00:39:26.449 --> 00:39:29.283
(gun fires)

350
00:39:29.283 --> 00:39:31.777
Get your gun loaded.

351
00:39:31.777 --> 00:39:34.277
(tense music)

352
00:39:36.397 --> 00:39:37.230
Now. go!

353
00:39:38.433 --> 00:39:40.726
(gun fires)

354
00:39:40.726 --> 00:39:42.276
I'm gonna go up the front.

355
00:39:42.276 --> 00:39:43.763
You go that way and flank them.

356
00:39:43.763 --> 00:39:44.682
You got me?

357
00:39:44.682 --> 00:39:45.515
- Yeah.

358
00:39:45.515 --> 00:39:46.598
- Go. go. go!

359
00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:55.323
It's clear.

360
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:59.770
- Where'd they go?

361
00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:09.020
- There's no one.

362
00:40:11.252 --> 00:40:12.213
No one for miles.

363
00:40:15.588 --> 00:40:16.670
- I thought you shot one of them.

364
00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:17.683
where's the body?

365
00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:23.023
- It's a good question.

366
00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:27.973
No shells. no tracks.

367
00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:32.173
They just disappeared.

368
00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:37.033
Doesn't make any sense.

369
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:41.130
I've heard of seeing ghosts in the desert.

370
00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:45.437
but those bullets. they were real enough.

371
00:40:46.657 --> 00:40:49.407
(dramatic music)

372
00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:57.950
I got comfortable with the idea

373
00:40:57.950 --> 00:41:00.483
spending the rest of
my days at that cabin.

374
00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:03.883
Thought I could leave this world behind.

375
00:41:08.406 --> 00:41:11.573
I didn't see it then. how wrong I was.

376
00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:16.193
I always told her it was going to be okay.

377
00:41:18.098 --> 00:41:19.098
I was lying.

378
00:41:21.435 --> 00:41:22.352
To us both.

379
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.670
I didn't want any of the
nightmares in this world

380
00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:28.603
to touch her.

381
00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.953
I thought we had found home.

382
00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:42.903
In the end. I was wrong.

383
00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:49.570
- What was she like?

384
00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:57.373
That's who you're thinking
about. I can tell.

385
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:01.303
- She was kind.

386
00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:08.080
Would've done anything for you.

387
00:42:12.198 --> 00:42:14.140
- My sister would do that too.

388
00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:14.973
Drift away.

389
00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:19.440
She'd dance around the room

390
00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.823
and dream of these far away places.

391
00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:25.833
The beach. the hot sun on her skin.

392
00:42:26.748 --> 00:42:29.983
Or a fancy restaurant with
gourmet food on the plates.

393
00:42:33.004 --> 00:42:35.467
I called them warm places in her mind.

394
00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:39.677
She started to look for those places.

395
00:42:39.677 --> 00:42:43.863
and it got the best of her.

396
00:42:46.090 --> 00:42:47.323
- Sorry for your loss.

397
00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:57.607
- What your brother did
to you was horrible.

398
00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:01.063
You're a good man.

399
00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:03.383
You can't just-

400
00:43:03.383 --> 00:43:04.300
- Negative.

401
00:43:05.603 --> 00:43:07.103
With all due respect. darling.

402
00:43:08.650 --> 00:43:11.033
you don't know what you're talking about.

403
00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:14.387
Or how good I am or not.

404
00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:23.360
- Why are we stopping?

405
00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:25.440
- Get your ass down.

406
00:43:39.731 --> 00:43:42.455
(gun fires)

407
00:43:42.455 --> 00:43:45.790
- Jesus. who are you shooting at?

408
00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:46.623
- Damn it.

409
00:43:47.517 --> 00:43:48.350
- What?

410
00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:49.300
- I just winged him.

411
00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:50.200
Come on. let's go.

412
00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:52.500
- Who are you shooting at?

413
00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:54.730
- Move it. come on!

414
00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:55.803
- He's over here.

415
00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:00.180
Looks like he's hurt pretty bad.

416
00:44:01.864 --> 00:44:04.690
- Then his troubles will
be over soon enough.

417
00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:07.085
You may want to look
the other way. darling.

418
00:44:07.085 --> 00:44:08.900
- You can't shoot him.

419
00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:09.830
- Why not?

420
00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:11.730
- [Cat Lady] Because he's defenseless!

421
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:14.890
- That isn't any kind of excuse.

422
00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:15.870
He has his coming.

423
00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:19.320
- You know. he might be
more help to you alive.

424
00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:21.890
You said you were looking
for all the soldiers. right?

425
00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:24.680
Well. he might be able to
tell you where they are.

426
00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:26.380
but he can't do that if he's dead.

427
00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:32.440
- Nah.

428
00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:34.413
He's unconscious. shot in the belly.

429
00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:37.670
He'll bleed to death
before he even wakes up.

430
00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:40.910
Shooting him at this
point is a mercy killing.

431
00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:48.259
- I don't think the bullet
even went that far in.

432
00:44:48.259 --> 00:44:50.463
It feels like it bounced
off a rib or something.

433
00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:54.630
- This one's gonna bounce
off the back of his skull.

434
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:55.940
Get the hell out of the way!

435
00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:56.773
- No!

436
00:44:58.743 --> 00:44:59.576
- All right.

437
00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:02.200
You stay here and watch him die.

438
00:45:09.615 --> 00:45:12.032
(man coughs)

439
00:45:18.741 --> 00:45:21.408
(ominous music)

440
00:46:29.757 --> 00:46:31.958
- Inform Command we
have located the source

441
00:46:31.958 --> 00:46:33.176
of the disturbance.

442
00:46:33.176 --> 00:46:34.509
- Sir. yes. sir.

443
00:46:36.405 --> 00:46:39.405
(tense synth music)

444
00:47:15.038 --> 00:47:20.038
(guns firing)
(Travis yells)

445
00:47:35.404 --> 00:47:38.487
(grenades exploding)

446
00:47:53.257 --> 00:47:55.570
- [Merle] Did you really
think you could kill us all?

447
00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:57.513
- [Travis] No. just you.

448
00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:00.370
- [Merle] Get up.

449
00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:04.783
- What?

450
00:48:07.289 --> 00:48:08.839
You gonna shoot me in the back?

451
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:15.203
- Those tribals. they come
to this place to sacrifice.

452
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.783
It's surrounded by some
kind of energy field.

453
00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:25.173
The skulls serve as a warning.

454
00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:29.073
They worship what lies beyond.

455
00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:32.809
Now start walking.

456
00:48:32.809 --> 00:48:35.309
(tense music)

457
00:49:29.872 --> 00:49:32.622
(haunting music)

458
00:50:28.350 --> 00:50:29.803
- Your fire's almost out.

459
00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:33.370
Maybe I should just stand here

460
00:50:33.370 --> 00:50:35.150
and watch you freeze to death.

461
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:37.433
take my compass off your dead body.

462
00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:40.403
But I felt inclined to say hello.

463
00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:43.813
- Hello.

464
00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:46.670
- You have something that belongs to me.

465
00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:53.140
- What's going on?

466
00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:55.820
- I don't associate with his kind.

467
00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:58.660
I best be leaving before I start shooting.

468
00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:00.083
- No. don't go!

469
00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:03.990
They kidnapped him three months ago

470
00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:05.800
and made him ride with them.

471
00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:09.653
He's just as much a
victim in this as anyone.

472
00:51:09.653 --> 00:51:13.990
- And how do I know he
didn't cook up some story

473
00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:15.920
to save his ass?

474
00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:18.540
I don't feel inclined to
sleep next to you either.

475
00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:20.640
Who knows what you'll take from me next?

476
00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:23.150
- I only took it so you'd come back.

477
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:25.693
- You chose to stay with him!

478
00:51:26.530 --> 00:51:28.430
You chose to stay here and die.

479
00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:30.243
don't put that bang on me!

480
00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:33.690
- You could save me from my ignorance.

481
00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:35.940
if you were the gentlemanly sort.

482
00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:38.590
- Good thing I'm not thusly
inflicted then. isn't it?

483
00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:45.171
So is he dying or what?

484
00:51:45.171 --> 00:51:46.192
- I mean the bleeding stopped.

485
00:51:46.192 --> 00:51:49.030
but I don't know.

486
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:51.240
- Well. how about it. you son of a bitch!

487
00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:53.000
- Don't shoot. don't shoot!

488
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.233
Please. don't shoot.

489
00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:57.410
Don't shoot.

490
00:51:57.410 --> 00:51:59.560
- He's not one of them. you know.

491
00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:00.993
Those men you're after.

492
00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:03.890
- It's true.

493
00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:04.723
It's true. sir.

494
00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:07.983
I'm not.

495
00:52:09.804 --> 00:52:12.503
A couple months ago they
got my brother and I.

496
00:52:14.782 --> 00:52:15.832
They killed my folks.

497
00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:21.060
Took all the supplies they
needed. burn everything else.

498
00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:23.263
- So why didn't they kill you. Cat Meat?

499
00:52:25.182 --> 00:52:28.413
- The head guy. Ramses.
he's after something.

500
00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:32.803
Well. he told us we could be soldiers.

501
00:52:33.852 --> 00:52:34.952
He said he'd train us.

502
00:52:36.222 --> 00:52:37.822
It's awful what they made us do.

503
00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:42.273
Ramses tried to make my
brother and I kill each other.

504
00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:47.563
Said one would die. the
other would get to eat.

505
00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:49.393
And...

506
00:52:51.482 --> 00:52:52.682
That night my brother...

507
00:52:58.500 --> 00:52:59.550
- So. you killed him.

508
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:03.550
- See?

509
00:53:03.550 --> 00:53:05.500
You're not the only one in some sorrow.

510
00:53:08.350 --> 00:53:10.330
You shot the poor kid.

511
00:53:10.330 --> 00:53:11.710
- Yeah. and I might shoot him some more

512
00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:13.873
if I don't like what he has to tell me.

513
00:53:13.873 --> 00:53:16.040
I might shoot you too.

514
00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:18.040
Save me a world of trouble.

515
00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:18.963
- I ran away.

516
00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:21.580
They didn't even bother following me.

517
00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:23.483
- Why do you suppose that is?

518
00:53:24.502 --> 00:53:26.952
- I'm not really sure.
Ramses is after something.

519
00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:31.720
I don't even think he
knows what it is himself.

520
00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:33.600
Something kinda out of the ordinary.

521
00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:38.600
Something supernatural. kinda godly.

522
00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:41.240
Heard guys around camp talking about it.

523
00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:42.970
Talking about when you get near.

524
00:53:42.970 --> 00:53:45.350
they kinda go a little bit crazy.

525
00:53:45.350 --> 00:53:47.510
Kinda lose their mind a little bit.

526
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:50.263
Shooting at men out of the wilderness.

527
00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:53.693
and just disappear. no bodies.

528
00:53:54.770 --> 00:53:56.413
- We head that way tomorrow.

529
00:54:03.905 --> 00:54:08.405
I don't like the fact I'm
being followed by these two.

530
00:54:13.146 --> 00:54:16.840
I should let them fall
asleep and gut them both.

531
00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:18.347
save some heartache.

532
00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:29.023
But I have to admit.

533
00:54:30.250 --> 00:54:32.453
it's not all bad seeing another face.

534
00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:34.980
- Stop. just...

535
00:54:37.708 --> 00:54:39.500
Just wait a minute.

536
00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:42.830
- [Travis] Even if it is
a sad excuse for a woman

537
00:54:42.830 --> 00:54:45.260
and a piss poor soldier.

538
00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:48.533
These are cold-blooded.
battle hardened soldiers.

539
00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:52.713
My current company won't stand a chance.

540
00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:58.340
(tense music)

541
00:55:06.868 --> 00:55:09.201
(gun fires)

542
00:55:15.378 --> 00:55:16.720
- [Cat Lady] Who the
hell is shooting at us?

543
00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:17.603
- Stay down.

544
00:55:22.587 --> 00:55:25.347
(gun fires)

545
00:55:25.347 --> 00:55:27.847
(tense music)

546
00:55:35.674 --> 00:55:36.757
Drop the gun!

547
00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:44.040
- Is he...

548
00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.280
- No. it went behind him.

549
00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:47.113
He fainted.

550
00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:50.580
- Hey.

551
00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:53.300
I don't really appreciate being shot at.

552
00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:55.343
- Of course I was shooting at you.

553
00:55:55.343 --> 00:55:56.360
You take a man's livelihood

554
00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:58.380
and then come back to finish the job?

555
00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:02.220
Well. do it if you're
gonna do it. you cowards!

556
00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:04.440
- What is he blabbering about?

557
00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:05.453
- Hard to say.

558
00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:07.663
Give him some space.

559
00:56:10.450 --> 00:56:11.283
Now...

560
00:56:12.930 --> 00:56:15.790
Why don't you tell me what the
hell you were talking about

561
00:56:15.790 --> 00:56:17.980
and I'll decide whether
or not I'll shoot you.

562
00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:19.763
- Him and his buddies.

563
00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:25.380
Some sort of soldiers come
across me and my wagon.

564
00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:27.230
I got away. but they took everything.

565
00:56:28.290 --> 00:56:31.153
except my gun. and now I'm
damn near out of ammunition.

566
00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:34.110
- You're more likely to
hit what you were aiming at

567
00:56:34.110 --> 00:56:35.483
if you use it as a club.

568
00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:37.793
How long ago was this?

569
00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:40.140
- Ask your friend.

570
00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:44.450
- I'm asking you. friend.

571
00:56:47.050 --> 00:56:49.400
Better start talking
before I lose my patience.

572
00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:55.832
- A few days ago one of them said

573
00:56:55.832 --> 00:56:58.010
they was gonna come back and. well.

574
00:56:58.010 --> 00:57:00.130
I saw that uniform and
figured you'd just come back

575
00:57:00.130 --> 00:57:01.193
to finish me off.

576
00:57:02.490 --> 00:57:04.703
- That uniform does attract gunfire.

577
00:57:07.410 --> 00:57:10.900
I can assure you he
wasn't amongst those men

578
00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:11.733
that you speak of.

579
00:57:11.733 --> 00:57:15.120
- Well. if you think that
makes me feel any better.

580
00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:17.650
you. sir. are sorely mistaken.

581
00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:19.403
You desert bandits are all alike.

582
00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:23.330
You can take my gun. I ain't got any food.

583
00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:28.053
- No. you seem miserable enough as it is.

584
00:57:29.282 --> 00:57:31.450
I'm gonna keep the gun for a while though

585
00:57:31.450 --> 00:57:32.550
before I give it back.

586
00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:37.850
I guess we make camp here tonight.

587
00:57:39.128 --> 00:57:41.593
I'll see what I can do
about hunting some food.

588
00:57:52.110 --> 00:57:54.070
- What are we gonna do
about the old timer?

589
00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:57.070
- Well. I figure let him run his mouth

590
00:57:57.070 --> 00:57:58.817
for a minute or two more.

591
00:57:58.817 --> 00:58:00.313
then I'll shoot him.

592
00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:03.340
Even though I said I wouldn't.

593
00:58:05.307 --> 00:58:07.107
Get that fire started. I'll be back.

594
00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:23.263
- I haven't sorted this all out myself.

595
00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:25.490
But maybe...

596
00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:31.631
Maybe a power. maybe someone or something

597
00:58:31.631 --> 00:58:34.580
greater than man keeps an eye

598
00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:39.060
when we become too
destructive or too powerful.

599
00:58:39.060 --> 00:58:41.950
Steps in and stomps us down to nothing.

600
00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:46.667
and leaves a few of us
to rebuild and forget.

601
00:58:49.010 --> 00:58:50.263
- That's nonsense.

602
00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:53.440
- You believe what you want.

603
00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:54.583
That's what I heard.

604
00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:58.150
And that doesn't sit with me well either.

605
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:59.930
but there's something
else happening here now.

606
00:58:59.930 --> 00:59:00.763
that's for sure.

607
00:59:00.763 --> 00:59:05.640
- So. all of this. because of a tall tale?

608
00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:09.210
- Now. I know this area
wasn't heavily populated.

609
00:59:09.210 --> 00:59:12.073
but there were cities
and there were towns.

610
00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:15.010
And they're gone. just gone.

611
00:59:15.010 --> 00:59:18.740
Even the big cities after
the riots and the fires.

612
00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:20.540
there was evidence of some settlements.

613
00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:21.490
but they are gone.

614
00:59:21.490 --> 00:59:24.250
It's like they never
existed in the first place.

615
00:59:24.250 --> 00:59:27.360
I mean. there are very few people left.

616
00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:30.640
And maybe a power that is greater than man

617
00:59:32.010 --> 00:59:34.883
is cleansing the earth of evil.

618
00:59:35.830 --> 00:59:38.593
- I think we found ourselves
a true believer this time.

619
00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:42.560
You gonna add this one
to your collection too?

620
00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:44.540
- I want to hear what he has to say.

621
00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:46.680
- Yeah. of course you do.

622
00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:48.279
You're insane too.

623
00:59:48.279 --> 00:59:49.112
- Ugh!

624
00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:52.862
- I like an appreciative audience.

625
00:59:52.862 --> 00:59:54.952
(Cat Lady chuckles)

626
00:59:54.952 --> 00:59:57.869
(soldier whistles)

627
01:00:03.312 --> 01:00:06.812
(Old Man plays harmonica)

628
01:00:09.535 --> 01:00:10.618
- Aw. Christ.

629
01:00:21.216 --> 01:00:23.883
(calming music)

630
01:00:45.649 --> 01:00:47.066
- She was pretty.

631
01:00:55.570 --> 01:00:59.115
You act like you're the only
one that's lost something.

632
01:00:59.115 --> 01:01:00.965
Me and that soldier. who have we got?

633
01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:04.840
You've heard the stories.

634
01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:07.400
You know if you go marching
out there after your brother.

635
01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:08.823
you're not coming back.

636
01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:12.400
And what's it gonna do if you do kill him?

637
01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.003
It's not gonna change anything.

638
01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:18.533
You've got a chance here
to do something good.

639
01:01:18.533 --> 01:01:19.890
or we can go with the old timer

640
01:01:19.890 --> 01:01:23.050
and find one of those towns
he's been talking about.

641
01:01:23.050 --> 01:01:24.890
We can all help each other out.

642
01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:26.560
We can start over.

643
01:01:30.350 --> 01:01:34.257
- There was a time that
would've been a real good offer.

644
01:01:40.350 --> 01:01:41.200
And you're right.

645
01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:46.783
There is no need for you or
that boy to come with me.

646
01:01:47.992 --> 01:01:49.592
- But what would your wife want?

647
01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:02.253
- [Travis] The old man was
nuts. no doubt about that.

648
01:02:03.770 --> 01:02:06.420
But he seemed the best and
only choice for those two.

649
01:02:07.835 --> 01:02:11.110
He could get them to one of
those towns he spoke about.

650
01:02:11.110 --> 01:02:14.080
Lead them away from whatever awaits me

651
01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.153
over that ridge.

652
01:02:24.239 --> 01:02:27.239
(tense synth music)

653
01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:55.813
(gun fires)

654
01:03:02.924 --> 01:03:04.774
They were shooting in all directions.

655
01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:10.083
Whoever hit these men
had the numbers to do it.

656
01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:14.213
More ghosts in the desert.

657
01:03:15.975 --> 01:03:18.975
(tense synth music)

658
01:03:28.210 --> 01:03:29.760
Is there anybody here with you?

659
01:03:35.410 --> 01:03:37.827
Where's the rest of your men?

660
01:03:40.133 --> 01:03:41.683
What the hell's wrong with you?

661
01:03:42.605 --> 01:03:43.522
Look at me!

662
01:03:46.101 --> 01:03:47.018
Look at me!

663
01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:50.890
- Holster your weapon. soldier.

664
01:03:50.890 --> 01:03:52.057
Nice and slow.

665
01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:57.973
Take a walk. move.

666
01:04:12.533 --> 01:04:15.616
On your knees nice and slow. soldier.

667
01:04:28.270 --> 01:04:31.493
So. you and I. we're
gonna finish the mission.

668
01:04:33.010 --> 01:04:34.693
Our men didn't die for no reason.

669
01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:40.563
Him over there. he's been
like that for three days.

670
01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:43.800
It's like they're all gone inside.

671
01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:47.680
And I'm sure by now you realize

672
01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:49.953
that things are a little
bit different around here.

673
01:04:51.130 --> 01:04:53.943
He hasn't talked. hasn't eaten.

674
01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:57.210
everything starts to seem different.

675
01:04:57.210 --> 01:04:59.310
He hasn't even taken his fuckin' mask off.

676
01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:05.053
Closer we got to it.

677
01:05:06.061 --> 01:05:08.011
the more they all started acting crazy.

678
01:05:10.050 --> 01:05:10.883
Even the men on...

679
01:05:10.883 --> 01:05:13.216
(gun fires)

680
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:27.880
(dramatic synth music)

681
01:05:49.131 --> 01:05:53.214
(man speaks in foreign language)

682
01:08:42.792 --> 01:08:45.292
(eerie music)

683
01:09:40.511 --> 01:09:42.928
(man grunts)

684
01:09:54.893 --> 01:09:56.813
- Are you fuckin' crazy now?

685
01:09:57.992 --> 01:09:59.430
- I don't know.

686
01:09:59.430 --> 01:10:00.263
Maybe.

687
01:10:00.263 --> 01:10:02.309
- You've got that shit in your head.

688
01:10:02.309 --> 01:10:03.540
You're losing it just like the others.

689
01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:04.763
you almost killed me!

690
01:10:07.156 --> 01:10:08.793
- That wouldn't be the first time.

691
01:10:11.107 --> 01:10:12.950
Where did you come from anyway?

692
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:15.464
- I've been following you
for the last few days.

693
01:10:15.464 --> 01:10:17.273
- You should've stayed with the old man.

694
01:10:19.487 --> 01:10:20.590
Give me my gun.

695
01:10:20.590 --> 01:10:22.840
- No. I think I'll hold
on to it for a while.

696
01:10:23.884 --> 01:10:24.717
- No.

697
01:10:24.717 --> 01:10:25.880
(gun fires)

698
01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:27.733
I only have three bullets left.

699
01:10:29.276 --> 01:10:31.340
What the hell do you
want with my gun anyway?

700
01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:32.820
- Why do you think I'd blindly follow

701
01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:35.727
the same son of a bitch who
put a bullet into my side?

702
01:10:35.727 --> 01:10:38.900
- I don't know.

703
01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:40.643
Maybe you're touched in the head.

704
01:10:40.643 --> 01:10:42.139
- You act like you're the only one

705
01:10:42.139 --> 01:10:43.910
that's got something to fight for.

706
01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:45.540
I'm going after Ramses.

707
01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:47.653
I'm going with or without you.

708
01:10:49.077 --> 01:10:51.410
- Are you sure that's a wise idea?

709
01:10:51.410 --> 01:10:52.933
You know what I'm up against.

710
01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:54.969
- They killed my brother.

711
01:10:54.969 --> 01:10:56.452
they killed my whole family.

712
01:10:57.910 --> 01:10:59.380
I'm going.

713
01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:00.213
- All right.

714
01:11:01.059 --> 01:11:02.743
Stop pointing that thing at me.

715
01:11:09.537 --> 01:11:12.537
(tense synth music)

716
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:26.263
Get down.

717
01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:30.870
I saw some movement over there.

718
01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:34.270
No. no. no.

719
01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:35.320
Leave that holstered.

720
01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:40.080
They have a perimeter set up.

721
01:11:41.330 --> 01:11:43.350
They hear those gunshots.

722
01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:45.103
the whole lot will be after us.

723
01:11:49.498 --> 01:11:50.957
We could do this by hand.

724
01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:53.693
Move fast.

725
01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:55.853
Silent.

726
01:11:57.041 --> 01:11:59.541
(tense music)

727
01:12:05.570 --> 01:12:06.403
- Maybe two men.

728
01:12:14.862 --> 01:12:17.446
(men groaning)

729
01:12:18.314 --> 01:12:20.639
(gun fires)

730
01:12:20.639 --> 01:12:23.389
(dramatic music)

731
01:12:30.448 --> 01:12:32.948
(guns firing)

732
01:13:13.842 --> 01:13:14.702
- [Travis] We gotta go!

733
01:13:14.702 --> 01:13:15.937
Go now!

734
01:13:15.937 --> 01:13:16.770
- Hoorah!

735
01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:22.380
(guns firing)

736
01:13:27.839 --> 01:13:30.422
(Travis yells)

737
01:14:01.965 --> 01:14:04.465
(eerie music)

738
01:14:23.868 --> 01:14:26.535
(Travis groans)

739
01:14:53.145 --> 01:14:54.110
- What the hell are you doing out here

740
01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:55.673
in the middle of hell anyway?

741
01:14:57.340 --> 01:14:59.773
- Something's in the mouth of this canyon.

742
01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:06.063
Something that changes you.

743
01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:09.112
Gets inside your mind.

744
01:15:10.177 --> 01:15:12.850
And I think you know
what I'm talking about.

745
01:15:12.850 --> 01:15:14.093
You've seen it too.

746
01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:17.660
It drove some of the men mad.

747
01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:19.173
I'm not sure what it is.

748
01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:23.110
But I know it's connected to
those crazy sons of bitches

749
01:15:23.110 --> 01:15:25.770
that managed to take out most of my men.

750
01:15:25.770 --> 01:15:28.452
They seem to be protecting
whatever's out there.

751
01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:31.483
and their numbers are growing.

752
01:15:32.389 --> 01:15:34.922
You can't seem to kill 'em. can you?

753
01:15:34.922 --> 01:15:36.172
- I don't know.

754
01:15:37.183 --> 01:15:39.313
I really didn't try that hard.

755
01:15:42.005 --> 01:15:43.639
- Well. I did.

756
01:15:43.639 --> 01:15:46.170
They've all mutated somehow.

757
01:15:46.170 --> 01:15:49.020
They act more like animals than people.

758
01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:52.030
We found one of the bodies
after they attacked.

759
01:15:52.030 --> 01:15:54.059
It was horribly disfigured.

760
01:15:54.059 --> 01:15:57.570
He was one of the Sons. a captain no less.

761
01:15:57.570 --> 01:16:00.400
He must've discovered something out there.

762
01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:01.969
or built some kind of weapon.

763
01:16:01.969 --> 01:16:03.570
- I don't care what's out there.

764
01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:07.013
You've been crazy long before all this.

765
01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:09.920
So what exactly do you
have to gain from it?

766
01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:11.870
- Some of the brains back home.

767
01:16:15.639 --> 01:16:18.253
they think this could be
a source of real power.

768
01:16:20.570 --> 01:16:22.270
Power that could change the world.

769
01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:24.103
- Oh. really?

770
01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:27.020
Well. what is it then?

771
01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:28.452
- No one's seen it yet.

772
01:16:29.389 --> 01:16:31.063
No one's been close enough.

773
01:16:35.771 --> 01:16:38.771
But it is powerful. that's for sure.

774
01:16:41.309 --> 01:16:42.713
Man gets ahold of that.

775
01:16:44.710 --> 01:16:47.097
he could be the next ruler of the world.

776
01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:53.010
- And I'll make sure you're
dead before that happens.

777
01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:00.460
- You were so pathetic.

778
01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:03.010
calling her like you were.

779
01:17:03.010 --> 01:17:05.350
Like some maimed animal

780
01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:07.153
needing to be put down.

781
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:10.233
So I did what I had to do.

782
01:17:11.322 --> 01:17:13.013
and I bashed your brains in.

783
01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:15.532
Looks like my blow was light.

784
01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:20.677
Must've been because
you're family and all.

785
01:17:23.504 --> 01:17:25.704
- And I'll see you dead
before this is over.

786
01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:28.719
- I think you could try.

787
01:17:32.730 --> 01:17:35.450
- You will pay for what you did. Merle.

788
01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:37.200
- Now you've come here for revenge?

789
01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:43.130
I don't think that's why you're here.

790
01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:49.000
I think you're here for me to put a bullet

791
01:17:50.416 --> 01:17:51.963
right between your eyes.

792
01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:55.362
How about it?

793
01:17:57.380 --> 01:17:59.693
Just a squeeze of the trigger.

794
01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:04.253
and then you get to see your family again.

795
01:18:08.653 --> 01:18:11.240
Isn't that what you want?

796
01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:13.898
- If you're gonna shoot me.

797
01:18:13.898 --> 01:18:15.150
then get it over with!

798
01:18:19.905 --> 01:18:21.987
- You don't deserve that.

799
01:18:23.639 --> 01:18:25.800
You don't deserve anything.

800
01:18:37.499 --> 01:18:40.499
(tense synth music)

801
01:18:49.466 --> 01:18:51.966
(guns firing)

802
01:19:09.446 --> 01:19:10.779
- What the hell?

803
01:19:12.884 --> 01:19:13.928
What's all that gunfire?

804
01:19:13.928 --> 01:19:15.530
- Come on. we've gotta get out of here.

805
01:19:15.530 --> 01:19:16.980
Someone's attacking the camp.

806
01:19:18.585 --> 01:19:21.085
(guns firing)

807
01:20:30.138 --> 01:20:32.721
(Travis yells)

808
01:20:35.849 --> 01:20:38.349
(guns firing)

809
01:20:54.603 --> 01:20:55.889
- I saw your brother slipping off

810
01:20:55.889 --> 01:20:57.340
when the savages attacked us.

811
01:20:58.824 --> 01:21:00.180
Me and the kid tried to tail him.

812
01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:01.200
- Which way did he go?

813
01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:02.170
- He went up over that ridge.

814
01:21:02.170 --> 01:21:04.753
right between those rocks. right there.

815
01:21:04.753 --> 01:21:07.253
(guns firing)

816
01:21:16.976 --> 01:21:19.660
- [Travis] I need you guys to go.

817
01:21:19.660 --> 01:21:21.809
- He's out there by himself
with these things chasing him.

818
01:21:21.809 --> 01:21:23.090
Let him find his own end.

819
01:21:23.090 --> 01:21:24.490
- You don't know my brother.

820
01:21:25.591 --> 01:21:26.710
This is something I've gotta do.

821
01:21:26.710 --> 01:21:28.700
- You've got nothing left to prove.

822
01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:30.160
He's as good as dead anyway.

823
01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:31.463
- I need you guys to go.

824
01:21:32.332 --> 01:21:33.360
Now!

825
01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:34.520
- No.

826
01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:35.530
That's the way Ramses went.

827
01:21:35.530 --> 01:21:38.013
that's the way I'm going
whether you like it or not.

828
01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.500
- I tried to keep him safe.

829
01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:41.480
I tried to lead him out of here

830
01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:43.000
and keep him safe just like you said.

831
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.780
- No. I know you did.

832
01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:46.445
I'll see you guys soon.

833
01:21:46.445 --> 01:21:47.891
Now go. go!

834
01:21:47.891 --> 01:21:50.391
(guns firing)

835
01:21:57.148 --> 01:21:58.315
It's his hide.

836
01:21:59.414 --> 01:22:01.914
(guns firing)

837
01:23:19.471 --> 01:23:20.304
- Ramses!

838
01:23:26.496 --> 01:23:28.996
(guns firing)

839
01:23:34.639 --> 01:23:36.844
(Travis yells)

840
01:23:36.844 --> 01:23:39.344
(tense music)

841
01:23:47.178 --> 01:23:49.678
(guns firing)

842
01:24:08.937 --> 01:24:10.943
- You dumb son of a bitch.

843
01:24:12.639 --> 01:24:13.990
Why didn't you wait for me?

844
01:24:23.588 --> 01:24:25.500
Come. you need to rest.

845
01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:27.340
I'm gonna get you out of here.

846
01:24:27.340 --> 01:24:29.228
Maybe that old timer can fix you up.

847
01:24:29.228 --> 01:24:31.978
(soldier grunts)

848
01:24:36.996 --> 01:24:37.829
- Get him.

849
01:24:39.973 --> 01:24:41.139
You have to...

850
01:24:42.343 --> 01:24:43.343
You have to.

851
01:24:52.327 --> 01:24:54.827
(guns firing)

852
01:25:03.882 --> 01:25:06.632
(dramatic music)

853
01:26:47.469 --> 01:26:50.052
(Travis yells)

854
01:27:25.879 --> 01:27:28.462
(men grunting)

855
01:28:20.362 --> 01:28:23.279
(mysterious music)

856
01:29:21.286 --> 01:29:22.119
- Hey!

857
01:29:23.252 --> 01:29:25.752
(tense music)

858
01:30:01.850 --> 01:30:02.693
It's over.

859
01:30:04.550 --> 01:30:08.173
- The anomaly is just over that rise.

860
01:30:10.620 --> 01:30:15.620
Finish me off. and all
that power is yours.

861
01:30:16.639 --> 01:30:18.600
- Not much has been on my mind

862
01:30:19.889 --> 01:30:22.333
except ending your worthless existence.

863
01:30:25.570 --> 01:30:27.202
I'm done with revenge.

864
01:30:29.290 --> 01:30:31.243
You're not worth the extra ammo.

865
01:30:33.380 --> 01:30:34.862
You lose any more blood.

866
01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:38.620
there ain't nothing on this earth

867
01:30:38.620 --> 01:30:41.683
or anywhere else that'll bring you back.

868
01:30:43.210 --> 01:30:44.540
- You mean to tell me

869
01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:49.930
you're not just a slightly bit interested

870
01:30:53.430 --> 01:30:54.733
what's over that ridge?

871
01:30:57.693 --> 01:31:00.850
I sacrificed everything to get here.

872
01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:06.690
It's only 50 yards.

873
01:31:06.690 --> 01:31:08.763
You could change things in this world.

874
01:31:10.580 --> 01:31:11.793
Make a difference.

875
01:31:13.270 --> 01:31:15.270
- There's some things better left alone.

876
01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:19.083
That's something you never understood.

877
01:31:21.090 --> 01:31:23.143
You ain't gonna hurt anybody else.

878
01:31:24.035 --> 01:31:25.285
and neither are your men.

879
01:31:26.332 --> 01:31:28.232
- You're just gonna leave me out here?

880
01:31:30.139 --> 01:31:34.513
Not even give yourself the
satisfaction of revenge?

881
01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:37.273
- Yeah.

882
01:31:39.550 --> 01:31:40.413
I reckon so.

883
01:31:42.469 --> 01:31:45.719
(dramatic synth music)

884
01:33:13.209 --> 01:33:15.876
(ominous music)
