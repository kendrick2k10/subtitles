A NETFLIX DOCUMENTARY

4
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:32.583
Morals

5
00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:37.166
are behaviors that society judges.

6
00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:41.958
Ethics

7
00:00:42.583 --> 00:00:46.375
are behaviors that your conscience judges.

8
00:00:47.625 --> 00:00:49.375
Each person.

9
00:00:49.875 --> 00:00:52.083
depending on where
and when they were born.

10
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:53.625
draws a line

11
00:00:53.708 --> 00:00:56.875
and says here to here is good.
and here to here is bad.

12
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.458
And what's craziest about this

13
00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:03.375
is when you get close to that line.

14
00:01:07.916 --> 00:01:10.333
<i>And that's why you decided to rob a bank?</i>

15
00:01:11.916 --> 00:01:13.083
<i>Why did you do it?</i>

16
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.291
Why did I rob a bank?

17
00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:19.708
That's a question

18
00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:22.666
I've asked myself many times.

19
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.500
I think the most reasonable answer is

20
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:29.458
the significance of death.

21
00:01:33.375 --> 00:01:35.708
At some point in the history of humanity.

22
00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:38.250
they realized life was very limited.

23
00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:42.291
since suddenly we passed through here
and didn't leave anything behind.

24
00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958
Therefore. I believe
the significance of death

25
00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:49.791
can come in two forms:

26
00:01:51.791 --> 00:01:53.041
as children

27
00:01:53.583 --> 00:01:54.791
or as art.

28
00:01:58.375 --> 00:02:00.375
That's what transcends death.

29
00:02:00.458 --> 00:02:02.583
a book you write. a painting.

30
00:02:03.375 --> 00:02:04.666
a pyramid.

31
00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:07.458
an artistic theft.

32
00:02:07.541 --> 00:02:11.125
I believe that. in this aspect.
the significance of death.

33
00:02:11.208 --> 00:02:15.000
realizing that life is finite.
is another reason

34
00:02:15.083 --> 00:02:17.500
that also led me to this.

35
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.916
<i>Four heavily armed criminals</i>

36
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.208
<i>enter the bank with the intent to rob it.</i>

37
00:02:29.833 --> 00:02:34.291
<i>There's a lot of tension in San Isidro.</i>
<i>A hostage situation.</i>

38
00:02:34.375 --> 00:02:38.208
<i>The Falcon Group intervened. and</i>
<i>the area is surrounded. We're there live.</i>

39
00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:40.000
<i>The famous Falcon Group</i>

40
00:02:40.083 --> 00:02:42.875
<i>doesn't know the safes are underground?</i>

41
00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958
<i>Let me continue speaking.</i>

42
00:02:45.041 --> 00:02:49.500
<i>All the hostages have been released.</i>
<i>and no criminals have been arrested.</i>

43
00:02:49.583 --> 00:02:52.791
<i>They looted 143 safety deposit boxes.</i>

44
00:02:52.875 --> 00:02:55.250
<i>Ninety-five million dollars.</i>

45
00:02:55.333 --> 00:02:58.416
<i>Maybe they're really smart guys.</i>
<i>but no matter how long it takes.</i>

46
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.208
<i>they'll have a nice story</i>
<i>to tell their cellmates in jail.</i>

47
00:03:04.208 --> 00:03:08.208
<i>The most spectacular robbery</i>
<i>in Argentinian criminal history.</i>

48
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:11.750
<i>Some people called it</i>
<i>"the robbery of the century."</i>

49
00:03:12.708 --> 00:03:16.583
<i>A police officer who got in told me.</i>
<i>"They vanished into thin air."</i>

50
00:03:24.125 --> 00:03:25.791
-All right. Fer.
-This again?

51
00:03:25.875 --> 00:03:27.458
Tell me what you want me to say.

52
00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:30.500
FERNANDO ARAUJO
THE ARTIST

53
00:03:30.583 --> 00:03:35.500
2003… Yeah. it was 2003.
I was the happiest man on earth.

54
00:03:35.583 --> 00:03:39.000
If you had surveyed everyone.
I'd be the happiest.

55
00:03:42.291 --> 00:03:43.291
I'd found

56
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:45.750
a calling.

57
00:03:47.666 --> 00:03:50.166
Suddenly. I wanted to make art.

58
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.125
For this. all I needed was
a 50-square-meter studio.

59
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.583
A place set up
to be able to aggravate my senses.

60
00:04:08.708 --> 00:04:10.416
At that time.

61
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.500
visual arts.

62
00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:15.166
martial arts.

63
00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.500
cannabis arts…

64
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.500
I was writing a book

65
00:04:24.583 --> 00:04:27.875
about the benefits of cannabis
and cultivating it indoors.

66
00:04:49.416 --> 00:04:51.041
It was an entire year off.

67
00:04:51.125 --> 00:04:54.208
full of a lot
of experimenting and craziness.

68
00:04:57.458 --> 00:04:58.583
I found myself in states

69
00:04:58.666 --> 00:05:01.041
where I didn't know
if it was day or night.

70
00:05:02.791 --> 00:05:06.166
I was doing painting.
the book about growing indoors.

71
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.416
Control it.

72
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.083
I had found a purpose and I loved that.

73
00:05:22.166 --> 00:05:25.041
What I didn't imagine

74
00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:29.375
is that after developing
these plants indoors.

75
00:05:31.708 --> 00:05:35.916
I was gonna have
a pretty important revelation.

76
00:06:05.208 --> 00:06:06.458
And…

77
00:06:08.916 --> 00:06:10.666
I decided to rob a bank.

78
00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.833
I didn't know how yet.

79
00:06:21.833 --> 00:06:23.375
but one thing was sure.

80
00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.083
There had to be some art in it.

81
00:06:34.416 --> 00:06:37.958
And that idea beganto take hold of me

82
00:06:38.041 --> 00:06:40.875
to the point that it was like.
"To hell with the paintings."

83
00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.791
and the only thing
I did from then on. 24/7.

84
00:06:43.875 --> 00:06:47.583
was think about how to rob a bank.

85
00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:04.166
My name is Luis Mario Vitette Sellanes.

86
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.125
I'm Uruguayan. I'm 65 years old.

87
00:07:12.208 --> 00:07:14.583
I was born in a place with good habits.

88
00:07:15.125 --> 00:07:17.375
with a really good economic situation.

89
00:07:19.083 --> 00:07:21.291
I define myself as a burglar.

90
00:07:21.375 --> 00:07:22.958
And what's a burglar?

91
00:07:23.041 --> 00:07:25.166
A burglar knows a little about jewels.

92
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.000
a little about locks.
and a little about art.

93
00:07:28.083 --> 00:07:29.666
a little about everything.

94
00:07:31.791 --> 00:07:35.666
Although my first crime
didn't have anything to do with robbery.

95
00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.250
I got to know jail. real jail.

96
00:07:39.333 --> 00:07:43.625
And anyone who knows jail
is not the same when they get out.

97
00:07:43.708 --> 00:07:45.833
And you learn all kinds of crimes.

98
00:07:45.916 --> 00:07:48.166
And you're gonna become a criminal.

99
00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:49.791
Rufi!

100
00:07:50.291 --> 00:07:51.125
Rufián!

101
00:07:52.083 --> 00:07:52.916
Charlotte!

102
00:07:54.833 --> 00:07:59.208
One day I went on a short trip.
and I said. "I'm not coming back anymore."

103
00:07:59.291 --> 00:08:01.666
I traveled to the Republic of Argentina.

104
00:08:08.458 --> 00:08:13.666
What does a fugitive
going to a foreign country do?

105
00:08:15.291 --> 00:08:17.166
He connects with criminals.

106
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:20.125
LUIS MARIO VITETTE
THE ACTOR

107
00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.250
Maybe we all. at some point.

108
00:08:27.333 --> 00:08:29.875
think about robbing a bank. you know?

109
00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:33.416
We watch movies.
but this idea started to take hold.

110
00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.916
I had to share it with someone.

111
00:08:38.875 --> 00:08:40.583
And it was with my shrink.

112
00:08:42.666 --> 00:08:47.541
The first thing I said to Jorge.
I remember. is. "I'm gonna rob a bank."

113
00:08:47.625 --> 00:08:49.041
"Why a bank?"

114
00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:51.416
Well. if it weren't a bank.
it'd be a casino.

115
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.250
Go there. a casino…

116
00:08:53.875 --> 00:08:55.750
I'm not against capitalism.

117
00:08:55.833 --> 00:08:59.333
To me. it's a great system that works.

118
00:08:59.416 --> 00:09:02.291
The only thing is
I wanted a chunk of the business.

119
00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:04.458
I wasn't gonna found a bank.

120
00:09:04.541 --> 00:09:07.750
I was gonna rob it. as Brecht said.

121
00:09:13.416 --> 00:09:16.916
At that time. he thought
it was part of the cannabis delusion.

122
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.708
all these ideas he'd been hearing from me.

123
00:09:19.791 --> 00:09:23.250
He said. "Okay. all good.
Let's leave it at that."

124
00:09:26.333 --> 00:09:30.041
So I started looking for a bank first.

125
00:09:30.666 --> 00:09:32.625
I live in Acassuso.

126
00:09:32.708 --> 00:09:36.791
a place where I was born. where I grew up.

127
00:09:38.666 --> 00:09:41.916
There was a bank on Libertador and Perú.

128
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.083
and I said. "This is the bank."

129
00:09:46.666 --> 00:09:48.125
The Acassuso Río Bank.

130
00:09:48.208 --> 00:09:49.041
BANK

131
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.250
Well. my name is Rubén de la Torre.
People call me Beto.

132
00:10:26.208 --> 00:10:28.416
I was born
in the Constitución neighborhood.

133
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.333
I went to Catholic school.

134
00:10:32.166 --> 00:10:34.750
I was there until I was 12.
I was even an altar boy.

135
00:10:34.833 --> 00:10:38.291
helping at Mass and everything.
but when I'd leave church.

136
00:10:38.375 --> 00:10:42.083
we'd go out to do some mischief
with friends because they were

137
00:10:42.166 --> 00:10:43.416
a lot like me.

138
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:48.458
It all started as an adventure.

139
00:10:48.541 --> 00:10:50.458
Later it became a habit

140
00:10:50.541 --> 00:10:53.458
and kept going until we'd steal some cars.

141
00:10:53.541 --> 00:10:56.458
Then they caught me and I went to Devoto.

142
00:10:56.541 --> 00:10:59.000
and I was put
with some of the worst people

143
00:10:59.083 --> 00:11:01.000
who had stolen guns

144
00:11:01.083 --> 00:11:05.625
and did attacks and commando-style hits.

145
00:11:05.708 --> 00:11:07.916
I got on board with them. let's say.

146
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:14.041
Theft and crime also became a vice.

147
00:11:14.916 --> 00:11:15.958
It was like.

148
00:11:16.791 --> 00:11:20.250
filling a void. I don't know.
But it was something I was missing.

149
00:11:20.333 --> 00:11:23.916
BETO DE LA TORRE
THE THUG

150
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.333
A bank can be robbed

151
00:11:25.833 --> 00:11:28.291
when it's open or when it's closed.

152
00:11:31.041 --> 00:11:33.083
When it's open. that means go in

153
00:11:34.458 --> 00:11:35.791
with guns…

154
00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.416
and try to get to the vault.

155
00:11:41.125 --> 00:11:43.500
Something that's impossible.

156
00:11:43.583 --> 00:11:47.583
The employees.
the private security have a button.

157
00:11:50.708 --> 00:11:53.333
And automatically. after a few minutes.

158
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.125
you're surrounded.
and you can't even take the coins.

159
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.458
Already. using guns

160
00:12:02.541 --> 00:12:07.708
wasn't my style
for what I was trying to do.

161
00:12:07.791 --> 00:12:09.583
something artistic without violence.

162
00:12:12.791 --> 00:12:16.166
So obviously I went with the other option:
when it was closed.

163
00:12:18.125 --> 00:12:22.500
And when it's closed.
the way to do it is with a hole.

164
00:12:22.583 --> 00:12:24.958
And this was the idea I developed.

165
00:12:25.041 --> 00:12:28.291
When you think of something like this.
you can't call your friends like.

166
00:12:28.375 --> 00:12:31.083
"Do you wanna do this?"
I mean. let's say. no.

167
00:12:31.166 --> 00:12:33.291
You have to find the right people.

168
00:12:33.375 --> 00:12:36.458
My motto is "intelligence over gunpowder."

169
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.250
Sebastián García Bolster.

170
00:12:51.291 --> 00:12:53.666
I'm Sebastián García Bolster.

171
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:55.833
And I don't know why. but

172
00:12:56.875 --> 00:12:58.541
they call me "the Engineer."

173
00:12:58.625 --> 00:13:01.833
SEBASTIÁN GARCÍA BOLSTER
THE ENGINEER

174
00:13:03.333 --> 00:13:08.083
I've lived my whole life in Martínez.
a typical middle-class family.

175
00:13:10.083 --> 00:13:11.458
I would see a device

176
00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:15.166
and think about
how I could get better results

177
00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:17.500
or more energy. more power.

178
00:13:20.291 --> 00:13:24.166
I studied. finished high school.
electrical technician.

179
00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:26.500
and then I started engineering. I quit.

180
00:13:27.166 --> 00:13:29.083
I started a motorcycle repair shop.

181
00:13:29.166 --> 00:13:33.875
From the repair shop.
I changed it until it became

182
00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.375
purely and exclusively
a Jet Ski repair shop.

183
00:13:39.458 --> 00:13:42.541
Fernando went to the same school as me.
the San Isidro Tech School.

184
00:13:42.625 --> 00:13:44.500
He was a year older than me.

185
00:13:44.583 --> 00:13:48.791
We became friends.
We went on vacation together.

186
00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:54.041
Fernando suggests I do this.

187
00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:57.291
I didn't steal. I never stole.

188
00:13:58.791 --> 00:14:01.583
But robbing a bank was all right.

189
00:14:01.666 --> 00:14:05.375
<i>Return our savings!</i>
<i>I worked my whole life.</i>

190
00:14:05.458 --> 00:14:09.500
My family always suffered
because of banks.

191
00:14:11.708 --> 00:14:12.666
Stealing is bad.

192
00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:16.791
but stealing from a bank that did
so much harm to people isn't so bad.

193
00:14:17.375 --> 00:14:19.250
He tells me about it.

194
00:14:19.333 --> 00:14:21.750
and I didn't say. "No. you're…"

195
00:14:21.833 --> 00:14:26.750
"No. yeah. whatever technical
or mechanical thing you need.

196
00:14:26.833 --> 00:14:28.625
count on me to do it."

197
00:14:28.708 --> 00:14:30.708
As a condition. I don't take risks.

198
00:14:30.791 --> 00:14:32.625
If it's not perfect.

199
00:14:33.666 --> 00:14:34.916
I don't get into it.

200
00:14:41.333 --> 00:14:44.416
I was gonna rent a house
that was four blocks away.

201
00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:49.375
make a tunnel.
and get to the basement of the bank.

202
00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:53.583
because the vault was down there.

203
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.750
But it wasn't that easy.
What if it collapsed on me?

204
00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:00.125
Because…

205
00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.583
Come on. Let's be honest.

206
00:15:02.666 --> 00:15:04.333
I've never dug a hole

207
00:15:04.416 --> 00:15:06.750
other than to plant weed.

208
00:15:09.833 --> 00:15:12.416
At the same time. I realized

209
00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.791
that when you get inside.
there are motion sensors.

210
00:15:17.083 --> 00:15:20.750
I spent months there
figuring out how they worked.

211
00:15:21.375 --> 00:15:24.000
I designed some suits
that could get by them.

212
00:15:29.083 --> 00:15:30.166
It worked.

213
00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:33.125
That's how Mr. Caterpillar is born.

214
00:15:36.041 --> 00:15:41.291
But getting past
the motion sensor system wasn't important.

215
00:15:41.375 --> 00:15:42.791
It was the vault itself.

216
00:15:45.166 --> 00:15:49.166
This insanity. which
I was sure I was gonna solve.

217
00:15:50.041 --> 00:15:51.458
was pretty complicated.

218
00:15:51.541 --> 00:15:54.583
So I fell apart.

219
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.125
At one point. I say it can't be done.

220
00:15:59.208 --> 00:16:00.375
It can't be done.

221
00:16:11.666 --> 00:16:15.500
I'm overwhelmed.

222
00:16:18.875 --> 00:16:24.250
I had invested a lot of time.
knowledge. and money buying stuff.

223
00:16:35.166 --> 00:16:38.333
And. well. this still wasn't working.

224
00:16:40.541 --> 00:16:41.958
I don't figure it out.

225
00:17:24.875 --> 00:17:27.333
Hope was born again.

226
00:17:27.416 --> 00:17:29.791
A new idea was born.

227
00:17:33.083 --> 00:17:35.666
Automatically. at three in the morning.

228
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:40.083
I left to look for
an Internet café to go online

229
00:17:40.166 --> 00:17:44.000
and see if anyone
had had this idea before.

230
00:17:45.416 --> 00:17:47.833
It was much more daring.

231
00:17:48.833 --> 00:17:51.875
A high-flying performance.

232
00:17:54.833 --> 00:17:57.291
And the idea was very simple…

233
00:18:00.541 --> 00:18:03.333
mixing the two methodologies:

234
00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:05.708
when the bank is closed
and when it's open.

235
00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:08.375
Go in.

236
00:18:09.083 --> 00:18:12.125
simulating an in-and-out robbery.
go to the registers.

237
00:18:12.208 --> 00:18:15.416
wait for the police to surround us.

238
00:18:16.208 --> 00:18:19.916
and use the tunnel.
not to enter. but to leave.

239
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:32.250
No one had ever done anything like this.

240
00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:35.166
And

241
00:18:36.125 --> 00:18:41.000
when you're a trailblazer.
you have a huge possibility of success

242
00:18:41.083 --> 00:18:43.791
because people aren't
ready for something new.

243
00:18:43.875 --> 00:18:46.208
I was very happy before when I discovered

244
00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:49.250
that art and 50 square meters
worked well for me.

245
00:18:49.333 --> 00:18:51.708
But this was part of that installation.

246
00:18:56.875 --> 00:18:59.500
Fernando would come and tell me.

247
00:18:59.583 --> 00:19:02.416
"Hey. I thought of this thing to do this."

248
00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:08.250
Every problem we had.
we had to evaluate various possibilities.

249
00:19:08.333 --> 00:19:09.708
from his point of view.

250
00:19:09.791 --> 00:19:10.875
from mine.

251
00:19:10.958 --> 00:19:13.041
as if it were a movie.

252
00:19:13.125 --> 00:19:17.166
as if it were an idea
of something in the future to be built.

253
00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:19.000
We're gonna do it like this and this.

254
00:19:19.083 --> 00:19:21.416
The thing I do then is…

255
00:19:22.166 --> 00:19:26.666
Well. what's the ground
in the northern part of Acassuso made of?

256
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:29.166
So that's where I started investigating.

257
00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:36.208
and I remember some workers
were making a drainage tunnel in Olivos.

258
00:19:36.291 --> 00:19:40.541
I go. "Hi. How are you?
I'm an architecture student."

259
00:19:40.625 --> 00:19:43.791
"One question. Can't this collapse?"

260
00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:51.166
He says. "No. the deeper it is.
the harder it is."

261
00:19:52.375 --> 00:19:53.375
Okay.

262
00:19:54.375 --> 00:19:58.625
Upon leaving. I observed some circles
left on the street from the work.

263
00:20:03.541 --> 00:20:04.541
The next day.

264
00:20:05.458 --> 00:20:06.666
I go to <i>calle</i> Perú.

265
00:20:07.541 --> 00:20:10.375
I see a circle this size.

266
00:20:11.416 --> 00:20:12.750
I see another.

267
00:20:13.708 --> 00:20:15.125
I couldn't believe it.

268
00:20:16.041 --> 00:20:20.125
The same circles I'd seen
at the construction site in Olivos.

269
00:20:20.958 --> 00:20:24.666
I mean. those traces every ten meters

270
00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:29.958
that went down <i>calle </i>Perú.
which borders the bank.

271
00:20:30.583 --> 00:20:35.041
were telling me there was
a drainage tunnel below.

272
00:20:48.291 --> 00:20:51.500
And suddenly I find the end of this drain.

273
00:20:52.083 --> 00:20:54.416
Ten blocks from the bank.

274
00:21:28.666 --> 00:21:32.416
I walk about 100 meters in. and I find

275
00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:38.125
a round drain. six meters in diameter

276
00:21:38.208 --> 00:21:42.375
which went through the bowels of the city.

277
00:21:48.583 --> 00:21:50.958
An incredible sight.

278
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.250
And that's where a new stage begins…

279
00:22:49.083 --> 00:22:51.291
called "Donatello Project."

280
00:22:58.333 --> 00:23:01.708
Donatello.
not after the Renaissance artist.

281
00:23:01.791 --> 00:23:04.125
but after the Ninja Turtle.

282
00:23:04.208 --> 00:23:06.791
They were in drainpipes
doing martial arts.

283
00:23:06.875 --> 00:23:08.750
and they were green like weed.

284
00:23:15.416 --> 00:23:20.333
If you walk for 20 minutes
in a dark tunnel

285
00:23:20.416 --> 00:23:23.000
and suddenly I stop you and ask.
"Where are you?"

286
00:23:23.083 --> 00:23:25.125
How should I know? It had to be measured.

287
00:23:36.916 --> 00:23:39.041
One. two.

288
00:23:40.458 --> 00:23:43.041
three. four…

289
00:23:43.125 --> 00:23:45.458
eleven. twelve…

290
00:23:45.541 --> 00:23:48.208
twenty-four. twenty-five…

291
00:23:48.833 --> 00:23:51.416
You know. I never knew

292
00:23:52.208 --> 00:23:54.833
I was gonna study
the cotangent of something

293
00:23:54.916 --> 00:23:56.875
until I decided to rob a bank. Incredible.

294
00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:04.500
It's like all the stuff I studied
in my life was all over the place.

295
00:24:04.583 --> 00:24:07.125
and it suddenly came together. you know?

296
00:24:07.875 --> 00:24:09.750
The cotangent was

297
00:24:10.541 --> 00:24:12.250
the 69 degrees that were necessary

298
00:24:12.333 --> 00:24:15.291
and also the distance
from the hypotenuse. 15 meters.

299
00:24:15.375 --> 00:24:18.583
DRAINPIPE
69 DEGREES

300
00:24:18.666 --> 00:24:20.666
TUNNEL. 15 METERS

301
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:23.375
UPPER CAMERA
BASEMENT

302
00:24:24.708 --> 00:24:29.500
Fernando and I did this whole first stage.

303
00:24:32.625 --> 00:24:36.916
We started to do the first chamber
with pegs and lights.

304
00:24:39.625 --> 00:24:42.458
To make. for example.
a hole kind of like this.

305
00:24:42.541 --> 00:24:44.541
the size of the end of a two-liter bottle.

306
00:24:44.625 --> 00:24:45.791
it takes an hour.

307
00:24:48.416 --> 00:24:49.250
It was impossible.

308
00:24:49.333 --> 00:24:52.708
So I had to bring a 220-volt generator

309
00:24:52.791 --> 00:24:55.875
and use an electro-pneumatic drill.

310
00:24:55.958 --> 00:24:58.708
LOWER CAMERA
2 METERS

311
00:24:58.791 --> 00:25:00.583
DRAINPIPE

312
00:25:02.375 --> 00:25:05.666
Later we realized there was no more money.

313
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:08.333
and we didn't physically
have the time to do it.

314
00:25:08.416 --> 00:25:15.000
so we needed someone to help us
financially as well as manually.

315
00:25:15.083 --> 00:25:17.500
And the second participant is the Doc.

316
00:25:17.583 --> 00:25:21.166
Again. I don't want any heroes.

317
00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:22.333
THE DOC

318
00:25:22.416 --> 00:25:26.416
He had a relative
who was involved in crime.

319
00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:29.833
in the big gangs of the '90s.

320
00:25:29.916 --> 00:25:33.375
Violent people going in with guns.

321
00:25:33.458 --> 00:25:37.125
Suddenly. we had more firepower
than the closest police station.

322
00:25:37.208 --> 00:25:40.875
I know the Doc.
and he seemed like a thoughtful person.

323
00:25:40.958 --> 00:25:42.208
He was a lawyer.

324
00:25:42.291 --> 00:25:44.625
So I was at ease.

325
00:25:44.708 --> 00:25:47.625
We still needed people.
I say we need to look for another person.

326
00:25:47.708 --> 00:25:51.583
and that's how the Doc
introduced me to Beto de la Torre.

327
00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:57.958
I always was in contact with the Doc.

328
00:25:58.791 --> 00:26:02.333
So. at one point.
he meets me at a gas station

329
00:26:02.875 --> 00:26:05.916
and says. "I'm gonna introduce you
to someone. a friend."

330
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.125
Then he introduces me to Facha. Fernando.

331
00:26:12.208 --> 00:26:13.666
A character

332
00:26:15.125 --> 00:26:17.625
who's shocking. strong.

333
00:26:17.708 --> 00:26:21.833
and accustomed to doing things
with violence.

334
00:26:21.916 --> 00:26:24.000
an explosion of gunpowder.

335
00:26:24.708 --> 00:26:28.041
"Look. I don't have
a lot of cash to go around."

336
00:26:28.125 --> 00:26:30.000
He says. "No. but I have a truck."

337
00:26:30.083 --> 00:26:33.250
"I'll sell it.
and we'll buy the materials we need."

338
00:26:35.166 --> 00:26:38.125
But things weren't moving along

339
00:26:38.208 --> 00:26:40.666
at the speed my anxiety was.

340
00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:43.666
I was on this 24/7. and the others…

341
00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:46.333
The Doc had his trials.

342
00:26:46.416 --> 00:26:49.375
Sebastián had woman troubles.

343
00:26:49.458 --> 00:26:51.083
Beta had gout.

344
00:26:51.666 --> 00:26:54.000
His legs were swollen
and he couldn't walk.

345
00:26:55.041 --> 00:26:56.625
I needed another person

346
00:26:57.208 --> 00:26:59.791
who had free time when I was free.

347
00:27:01.625 --> 00:27:03.708
Stealing in Argentina was really easy.

348
00:27:06.916 --> 00:27:09.875
I hung out with all kinds of people.

349
00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:13.208
And I ended up with a "Spider-Man" gang.

350
00:27:15.875 --> 00:27:17.666
So we climbed.

351
00:27:18.375 --> 00:27:20.833
lowered ourselves down.
went up to the 18th. 20th floor.

352
00:27:20.916 --> 00:27:24.250
looking for where people kept their stuff.

353
00:27:26.958 --> 00:27:28.708
When they contacted me.

354
00:27:30.125 --> 00:27:33.416
we agreed I'd come cut open safes

355
00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.916
where we'd split half a million dollars.

356
00:27:37.666 --> 00:27:42.291
I come walking from <i>calle</i> Libertad
really well-dressed. like I liked.

357
00:27:42.375 --> 00:27:45.125
and someone turns to me.
"Hi. Marito. How are you?"

358
00:27:45.208 --> 00:27:46.041
"Hi. Doc."

359
00:27:47.625 --> 00:27:50.833
The first thing he asks me is.
"Do you have money?"

360
00:27:50.916 --> 00:27:53.875
"Yeah. of course." I told him.
"We need to talk."

361
00:27:55.375 --> 00:27:57.291
"I have a very important job."

362
00:27:57.791 --> 00:27:59.625
"I have the job of my life."

363
00:27:59.708 --> 00:28:02.166
"Look. Let me tell you. Marito."
And I said. "Stop."

364
00:28:02.833 --> 00:28:04.958
"If you're in. I'm in.
Don't tell me anything."

365
00:28:10.916 --> 00:28:16.125
I remember that day
there was Sebastián. Beto.

366
00:28:16.625 --> 00:28:18.750
and the Doc brought Marito.

367
00:28:20.125 --> 00:28:24.208
And I meet this tiny person.
1.6 meters tall.

368
00:28:24.291 --> 00:28:26.458
sticking out his chest
like a total shorty.

369
00:28:26.541 --> 00:28:27.958
"Hi. buddy."

370
00:28:28.791 --> 00:28:29.916
"How are you?"

371
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.666
He goes up to the studio
and starts looking at the paintings.

372
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:36.958
I had pictured the studio.

373
00:28:37.041 --> 00:28:38.833
easels. oil paint…

374
00:28:38.916 --> 00:28:40.625
This one was a shithole.

375
00:28:42.625 --> 00:28:45.166
And they introduced me
to the guy with the idea.

376
00:28:45.958 --> 00:28:47.250
some Araujo guy.

377
00:28:49.708 --> 00:28:53.875
He takes me somewhere else
and says. "Look. I cultivate here."

378
00:28:53.958 --> 00:28:56.166
He lifts up a little curtain.
and there are lights

379
00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:58.416
and a ton of marijuana plants.

380
00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.250
A dramatic character.

381
00:29:00.333 --> 00:29:05.125
someone who's really
one of those snake charmers. you know?

382
00:29:05.791 --> 00:29:07.666
I didn't really have a feeling.

383
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:14.000
Beto's greeting seemed really cordial.
And after. it was de la Torre.

384
00:29:14.083 --> 00:29:17.541
I felt myself getting little goosebumps

385
00:29:17.625 --> 00:29:21.833
from that boy named Sebastián.
who I later found out was García Bolster.

386
00:29:22.416 --> 00:29:26.250
That's… I don't know.
Something tells you. "Watch out."

387
00:29:29.125 --> 00:29:32.833
And one day this Araujo guy calls me

388
00:29:32.916 --> 00:29:35.958
and says. "Can you come?
Bring comfortable clothes."

389
00:29:36.041 --> 00:29:38.166
"We might get dirty."

390
00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:42.625
I said. "My God.
where are we going? Am I on time?"

391
00:29:42.708 --> 00:29:44.083
But curiosity

392
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:47.208
killed the cat.

393
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:55.166
The first time was truly terrifying.

394
00:29:56.416 --> 00:30:02.541
Imagine yourself walking here. it's
full of excrement. cans. weapons. pipes.

395
00:30:03.625 --> 00:30:08.500
Pipes. these illegal connections
from houses.

396
00:30:11.083 --> 00:30:15.250
And when we got to the place
that was already done.

397
00:30:15.333 --> 00:30:17.291
the first chamber.

398
00:30:17.375 --> 00:30:20.000
I say. "Look for it and see where it is."

399
00:30:20.083 --> 00:30:22.375
And the guy starts looking
at all the metal plates.

400
00:30:23.916 --> 00:30:26.000
I actually saw a huge ring.

401
00:30:26.083 --> 00:30:28.500
a tremendous circumference.
an enormous pipe.

402
00:30:28.583 --> 00:30:30.291
ten meters full of metal plates.

403
00:30:30.375 --> 00:30:33.708
"What do you see?" "Nothing. buddy.
What am I gonna see? I wanna go."

404
00:30:33.791 --> 00:30:36.541
I opened the metal plate for him.
There was a chamber.

405
00:30:36.625 --> 00:30:39.000
I say. "Look. Here we have
the <i>Baywatch</i> rescue cans."

406
00:30:39.083 --> 00:30:41.250
<i>"Baywatch</i> rescue cans?" He says.

407
00:30:41.333 --> 00:30:42.833
"Where are the girls?"

408
00:30:44.666 --> 00:30:50.083
"No. the <i>Baywatch</i> rescue cans
are in case it suddenly starts raining."

409
00:30:50.166 --> 00:30:52.541
"The water level is gonna rise.

410
00:30:52.625 --> 00:30:55.291
and the only thing
we can do to save our lives

411
00:30:55.375 --> 00:30:58.333
is grab a <i>Baywatch</i> rescue can.
bodysurf on the current.

412
00:30:58.416 --> 00:31:01.375
and pray to whomever you wish

413
00:31:01.458 --> 00:31:03.083
to get out alive."

414
00:31:03.666 --> 00:31:05.791
-"I don't understand."
-"Honestly. I don't either."

415
00:31:05.875 --> 00:31:07.916
I didn't want to look into it
too much either.

416
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.166
because I already saw this was not for me.

417
00:31:11.541 --> 00:31:13.125
He puts the screws back in.

418
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:15.458
and we go back down the path.

419
00:31:16.125 --> 00:31:18.041
Then we get to the end of the tunnel.

420
00:31:18.125 --> 00:31:19.958
Well. I couldn't get that stuff off.

421
00:31:20.041 --> 00:31:23.708
I threw some water from the drain
on myself. and it was worse.

422
00:31:23.791 --> 00:31:26.125
My clothes. horrible.

423
00:31:27.583 --> 00:31:29.166
We got in the truck.

424
00:31:29.791 --> 00:31:33.625
We go along
an endless ledge until it ended.

425
00:31:34.583 --> 00:31:35.958
and I said. "Turn here."

426
00:31:37.625 --> 00:31:39.625
"Did you see where we were below?"

427
00:31:40.916 --> 00:31:41.791
"Yeah. I saw."

428
00:31:42.583 --> 00:31:48.291
"If we make the appropriate tunnel.
it takes us right to the bank's vaults."

429
00:31:49.708 --> 00:31:50.916
Now I liked it.

430
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.375
The hand I needed appeared.

431
00:31:54.458 --> 00:31:58.625
because the guy
was available 24/7 for this.

432
00:32:14.958 --> 00:32:19.416
And that's when we started
months of work with Mario

433
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:22.083
climbing stairs.

434
00:32:22.166 --> 00:32:25.083
electro-pneumatic drilling.

435
00:32:25.166 --> 00:32:28.416
a lot of <i>mate</i> tea.

436
00:32:29.833 --> 00:32:33.500
We left the cars next to the pipe opening.

437
00:32:33.583 --> 00:32:36.083
We tied ropes to them and went in there.

438
00:32:36.583 --> 00:32:38.250
A couple of us went down.

439
00:32:38.333 --> 00:32:41.333
and the others stayed up. standing guard.

440
00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:45.416
Forensic police were 30 meters away.

441
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:50.500
and we didn't know if someone had seen us
from some window and was coming down.

442
00:32:50.583 --> 00:32:53.625
The setbacks were the materials.

443
00:32:54.375 --> 00:33:00.000
We needed drill bits.
grinding discs. lamps. cables.

444
00:33:00.083 --> 00:33:02.000
All the materials we were using.

445
00:33:02.791 --> 00:33:05.583
We had to fix the generator.

446
00:33:05.666 --> 00:33:07.458
buy tools.

447
00:33:07.541 --> 00:33:08.666
-How much is it?
-500.

448
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:10.208
Five hundred with batteries?

449
00:33:10.291 --> 00:33:14.083
And then shoes. hard hats.
and life jackets for everyone.

450
00:33:14.708 --> 00:33:16.125
I had my life.

451
00:33:16.208 --> 00:33:18.416
and at night. well…

452
00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:22.250
They ask me. "Did you steal?"
No. I worked. I treated it like a job.

453
00:33:24.166 --> 00:33:28.625
Since leaving at night
and returning another day was normal.

454
00:33:28.708 --> 00:33:33.375
my ex-wife. Alicia. was worried
Mario was coming to get me to go party.

455
00:33:33.458 --> 00:33:37.041
We were actually going to make the tunnel.
Sometimes we'd also go out.

456
00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:42.875
We spent close to a year
going in and out. A little more.

457
00:33:43.458 --> 00:33:45.333
We still didn't have money.

458
00:33:45.875 --> 00:33:47.708
We still didn't have an ego.

459
00:33:47.791 --> 00:33:51.625
It was us. If a problem arose.
we'd resolve it between us.

460
00:33:54.958 --> 00:34:00.250
I knew that in 15 meters
we had to arrive at the bank.

461
00:34:02.041 --> 00:34:03.541
We were close to the concrete.

462
00:34:05.375 --> 00:34:06.291
and suddenly…

463
00:34:07.958 --> 00:34:10.583
I hit something different.

464
00:34:10.666 --> 00:34:12.583
I hit a different density.

465
00:34:13.541 --> 00:34:16.958
Suddenly I hit something hard.
and it was exciting. you know?

466
00:34:17.041 --> 00:34:19.958
But will it be the bank's wall?

467
00:34:20.041 --> 00:34:24.458
Have I done the calculations right?
Did I measure the bicycle wheel right?

468
00:34:25.416 --> 00:34:28.375
And what if this is
the neighbor's basement wall?

469
00:34:28.458 --> 00:34:30.875
What if on D-Day. I suddenly open the hole

470
00:34:30.958 --> 00:34:35.000
and find the neighbor taking a dump
in the basement bathroom?

471
00:34:35.583 --> 00:34:37.916
Well. to get better precision.

472
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.750
I made a two-meter drill bit.

473
00:34:39.833 --> 00:34:41.750
So where the tunnel ended.

474
00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:44.833
we drilled and came out on the sidewalk.

475
00:34:45.416 --> 00:34:48.416
I say. "Yeah. this is my <i>MacGyver."</i>

476
00:34:49.041 --> 00:34:53.208
The guy solved it for me
with 50 pesos with a Thursday special.

477
00:34:53.291 --> 00:34:54.458
Otherwise. it'd cost 100.

478
00:34:57.708 --> 00:35:01.125
With a normal hole. you have
the whole weekend to open deposit boxes.

479
00:35:01.208 --> 00:35:02.125
Here.

480
00:35:02.666 --> 00:35:06.708
we needed to open deposit boxes
as fast as possible.

481
00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:15.750
So then Fernando says.
"Sure. a device like this.

482
00:35:15.833 --> 00:35:18.875
like sheet-metal workers use. see?"

483
00:35:18.958 --> 00:35:22.625
I say. "Yeah. all right. that's hydraulic.
Let's see what we can design."

484
00:35:29.416 --> 00:35:32.250
We looked for
a standard mini hydraulic unit.

485
00:35:34.541 --> 00:35:37.625
and based on the capacity
of that hydraulic unit.

486
00:35:37.708 --> 00:35:41.875
I designed the cylinder.
the piston that makes it thrust.

487
00:35:43.791 --> 00:35:46.000
And that's how we put the device together.

488
00:35:49.791 --> 00:35:55.125
The back was telescopic.
so you could regulate the distance.

489
00:36:00.666 --> 00:36:04.666
With that device. we were really safe.

490
00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:08.375
We knew in seven seconds
we'd open a deposit box

491
00:36:08.458 --> 00:36:10.500
and no one would hear it.

492
00:36:12.291 --> 00:36:14.541
And that's how
the "power cannon" was born.

493
00:36:24.625 --> 00:36:27.583
We all visualized going down the tunnel

494
00:36:27.666 --> 00:36:30.541
to the drainpipe with the loot.

495
00:36:31.833 --> 00:36:34.500
Now what do we do there?

496
00:36:41.125 --> 00:36:45.958
The primary fundamental idea
was precisely to go to the riverside.

497
00:36:46.041 --> 00:36:49.416
But basically. that's what
the police were gonna think.

498
00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:51.791
The moment they found out
about our escape.

499
00:36:51.875 --> 00:36:53.541
they were going to the river.

500
00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:59.041
Therefore. this is where I say
we have to go the other way.

501
00:37:05.291 --> 00:37:07.666
The other way was an advantage

502
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:09.750
because there were 100 places to get out.

503
00:37:09.833 --> 00:37:13.250
Then. after scoping it out.
we found the best place.

504
00:37:13.333 --> 00:37:14.583
14 blocks from the bank.

505
00:37:14.666 --> 00:37:18.000
close to a corner
where we could park a car.

506
00:37:18.083 --> 00:37:20.291
make a hole in the bottom.
and go directly through

507
00:37:20.375 --> 00:37:23.375
without leaving the tunnel
or anyone seeing us.

508
00:37:25.916 --> 00:37:30.875
Walking inside the tunnel was hard.

509
00:37:30.958 --> 00:37:34.250
because everything
we had to carry was really heavy.

510
00:37:35.041 --> 00:37:40.833
So we thought about raising
the water level to be able to sail.

511
00:37:46.041 --> 00:37:48.041
So we made the dam.

512
00:37:48.125 --> 00:37:51.916
A lot of iron. rope. wood.

513
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.250
and expandable polyurethane
to make it waterproof.

514
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:04.916
"FRONT VIEW"
6 METERS

515
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.791
We went to the surface.
and right then. a really big storm came.

516
00:38:09.708 --> 00:38:12.291
After the storm. ten. 15 days later.

517
00:38:12.375 --> 00:38:14.500
we went down to see the dam.
and it was gone.

518
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.958
The storm had carried it away.

519
00:38:17.041 --> 00:38:19.708
I say. "No. stop.
That's it. We're gonna walk."

520
00:38:19.791 --> 00:38:22.416
"I can assure you
we're gonna take advantage of this."

521
00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:26.583
Enough already. I was done. But suddenly.
I say. "No. let's make the dam.

522
00:38:27.125 --> 00:38:30.500
because when they find out
we had a dam and rubber boots.

523
00:38:31.166 --> 00:38:33.000
it's gonna be terrible."

524
00:38:48.083 --> 00:38:50.916
The idea of studying

525
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.791
how to get to a vault
or how to dig a tunnel

526
00:38:54.875 --> 00:38:57.041
had now become

527
00:38:58.333 --> 00:39:01.833
studying the psychology
of the Falcon Group.

528
00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:07.166
Finding the manual. which was. let's say.

529
00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:11.083
the hostage-taking protocol bible.

530
00:39:14.833 --> 00:39:15.750
Listening

531
00:39:16.458 --> 00:39:18.541
to police radio.

532
00:39:23.625 --> 00:39:25.791
Therefore. I was beginning to understand

533
00:39:25.875 --> 00:39:28.125
the times. methodology.

534
00:39:28.208 --> 00:39:31.875
and things that were gonna happen
when suddenly.

535
00:39:32.583 --> 00:39:35.250
from inside the bank.
they say. "They're robbing us."

536
00:39:38.583 --> 00:39:40.833
For me. knowing the enemy

537
00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:45.416
is when the war is almost won.

538
00:39:55.958 --> 00:40:01.250
We need a specific truck
to be able to open a door on the floor.

539
00:40:01.333 --> 00:40:03.375
I think we paid
five or six thousand dollars.

540
00:40:04.083 --> 00:40:07.750
And Beto de la Torre took it
to a house he has in Wilde.

541
00:40:09.916 --> 00:40:12.500
We modified the truck there.

542
00:40:12.583 --> 00:40:18.208
We cut off part of it
so we could pass things through the floor.

543
00:40:18.291 --> 00:40:21.875
We got to work.
and his wife was there. you see?

544
00:40:21.958 --> 00:40:24.291
And I said. "What is she doing here?"

545
00:40:27.833 --> 00:40:32.375
We were looking at each other.
How come this lady was here too?

546
00:40:32.458 --> 00:40:34.583
"No. it's fine."

547
00:40:35.791 --> 00:40:36.750
That's it.

548
00:40:36.833 --> 00:40:42.416
That was the time I met Alicia Di Tullio.

549
00:40:43.833 --> 00:40:46.625
ALICIA DI TULLIO
THE WIFE

550
00:40:46.708 --> 00:40:48.916
Still. she didn't even know my name.

551
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.208
because at no point
did I introduce myself or anything.

552
00:40:53.125 --> 00:40:54.125
But I was there.

553
00:40:57.875 --> 00:40:59.791
We need a driver for the van.

554
00:40:59.875 --> 00:41:01.916
The Countryman. Zalloechevarría.

555
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:02.958
A law man.

556
00:41:03.041 --> 00:41:04.458
JULIÁN ZALLOECHEVARRÍA
THE COUNTRYMAN

557
00:41:04.541 --> 00:41:06.416
After that. we added the Kid.

558
00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:07.333
THE KID

559
00:41:07.416 --> 00:41:08.500
"You'll be there on D-Day."

560
00:41:08.583 --> 00:41:11.916
"The only thing you have to do
is point a gun and do what we tell you."

561
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.083
Yeah. imagine.

562
00:41:32.666 --> 00:41:36.708
I spent 500 days thinking about this job.

563
00:41:38.833 --> 00:41:40.833
I didn't do anything except that.

564
00:41:43.375 --> 00:41:47.250
The first day I already knew
how to get the money from there.

565
00:41:47.916 --> 00:41:51.625
but. nevertheless. the second day
I revised my achievement.

566
00:41:51.708 --> 00:41:53.166
And the third day too.

567
00:41:57.666 --> 00:42:00.291
How many times
did we revise our achievement?

568
00:42:04.208 --> 00:42:07.083
I came up with the plan in September 2004.

569
00:42:07.708 --> 00:42:09.958
Do you know what I honestly thought?

570
00:42:10.041 --> 00:42:13.125
That by the beginning of 2005.
we'd be able to do it.

571
00:42:17.625 --> 00:42:22.458
I never thought it was gonna be so hard
and take more than a year.

572
00:42:40.208 --> 00:42:43.875
SCANZIANI TAILOR SHOP

573
00:42:46.333 --> 00:42:47.333
Pants.

574
00:42:49.166 --> 00:42:53.166
I was so in that I wanted to go in
even if it rained or was raining.

575
00:42:56.916 --> 00:42:59.666
At that time. the only risk was

576
00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:02.458
when there was a hostage situation.
someone brilliant.

577
00:43:02.541 --> 00:43:07.416
someone who thought
we could escape through the sewers.

578
00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:10.625
would block our exit. and bye.
we wouldn't be going anywhere.

579
00:43:29.916 --> 00:43:34.250
I wasn't very focused the other day.

580
00:43:35.541 --> 00:43:37.500
But I was determined.

581
00:43:41.208 --> 00:43:43.791
When everything was discovered.
it was like

582
00:43:45.416 --> 00:43:47.250
we were gonna create a novel.

583
00:43:49.208 --> 00:43:51.750
It was gonna be the focus of the summer.

584
00:44:26.416 --> 00:44:29.416
Our event's gonna be Friday. January 13.

585
00:44:30.125 --> 00:44:31.541
Is anyone superstitious?

586
00:44:34.833 --> 00:44:35.958
Very well.

587
00:44:36.041 --> 00:44:39.791
JANUARY 13. 2006
D-DAY

588
00:45:06.916 --> 00:45:09.250
I got up at seven in the morning.

589
00:45:09.958 --> 00:45:14.000
I got dressed carefully
and got my shoes. shirt. and tie ready.

590
00:45:15.666 --> 00:45:17.416
I went to pick up the Kid.

591
00:45:19.166 --> 00:45:21.583
And we headed for the D-Day zone.

592
00:45:23.541 --> 00:45:28.166
I remember being at a big table at night.

593
00:45:29.458 --> 00:45:32.958
having absolutely everything
I needed to take.

594
00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:36.583
totally sanitized of fingerprints.

595
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.333
Let's think about
and review the positions.

596
00:45:45.416 --> 00:45:48.708
First. at 9:00 a.m..

597
00:45:49.416 --> 00:45:52.666
Sebastián is gonna go down the drainpipe.

598
00:45:57.166 --> 00:45:58.833
I started walking.

599
00:45:58.916 --> 00:46:00.708
I got to the dam.

600
00:46:02.166 --> 00:46:04.500
At the dam. I took the motor

601
00:46:05.958 --> 00:46:09.541
and verified that everything
was in good condition.

602
00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:19.583
And I pushed myself up
against the hole that went to the bank.

603
00:46:19.666 --> 00:46:23.666
And I waited until they gave me the okay.

604
00:46:30.333 --> 00:46:31.375
The Doc…

605
00:46:33.625 --> 00:46:34.458
and Beto.

606
00:46:35.208 --> 00:46:37.291
you're gonna walk in.

607
00:46:38.333 --> 00:46:41.791
Alicia went with me to the place.

608
00:46:42.375 --> 00:46:44.375
She dropped me off
on the corner of the bank

609
00:46:44.875 --> 00:46:48.375
and left. She left the car
where she had to leave the car.

610
00:46:48.875 --> 00:46:49.875
My car.

611
00:46:51.041 --> 00:46:53.750
Now. the Countryman goes

612
00:46:54.708 --> 00:46:56.166
and is gonna get in position

613
00:46:57.041 --> 00:47:00.291
in the escape sewer
at 3 Sargentos and Libertad.

614
00:47:13.166 --> 00:47:14.583
I parked.

615
00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:20.208
We went walking
with the Kid for a block or two.

616
00:47:20.708 --> 00:47:25.375
We found the Ford Escort
that was already waiting for us.

617
00:47:26.208 --> 00:47:28.791
We stood there chatting.
both of us really well-dressed.

618
00:47:28.875 --> 00:47:31.583
I had on my classic three-piece suit.

619
00:47:31.666 --> 00:47:35.541
We passed by and saw the parked car
with Marito and the other colleague.

620
00:47:35.625 --> 00:47:37.041
"Hi. How are you?"

621
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.666
I'm gonna arrive in this vehicle.

622
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:51.458
I'm gonna leave it. marked.
with some tire spikes in the backseat

623
00:47:51.541 --> 00:47:57.041
so when the Falcon Group approaches.
they'll see it was our escape vehicle.

624
00:48:02.708 --> 00:48:07.250
That January 13th. we go in.
I make sure everything's fine.

625
00:48:07.333 --> 00:48:08.458
REAL SECURITY CAMERAS
RÍO BANK

626
00:48:08.541 --> 00:48:10.250
The alarms. the security cameras.

627
00:48:10.333 --> 00:48:14.208
and that's where I give
the present to the local police.

628
00:48:14.291 --> 00:48:15.791
WALTER SERRANO
THE GUARD

629
00:48:15.875 --> 00:48:18.458
During that time.
which seemed to pass pretty quickly.

630
00:48:18.541 --> 00:48:20.250
I was really tired.

631
00:48:20.333 --> 00:48:23.875
Moreover. I think I was even half asleep.

632
00:48:24.666 --> 00:48:28.750
On the way. yeah. really slowly
and really smoothly. I put on some drops.

633
00:48:28.833 --> 00:48:32.583
That sticky adhesive is a gadget we have

634
00:48:32.666 --> 00:48:36.166
to disguise our fingerprints.

635
00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:39.750
And we got
to the parking garage of the bank.

636
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:46.666
We get out really calmly.

637
00:48:47.166 --> 00:48:49.125
And when we faced the door to go in.

638
00:48:49.208 --> 00:48:52.458
the bunker policeman
signals to us and says that

639
00:48:52.541 --> 00:48:57.041
at noon the employees go to lunch.
and that door stays closed.

640
00:48:57.708 --> 00:48:59.958
So we picked up the pace with the Kid.

641
00:49:00.458 --> 00:49:02.000
We went up the ramp.

642
00:49:02.583 --> 00:49:05.041
We went right to the main door.

643
00:49:05.125 --> 00:49:09.458
and the Doc and Beto
were just entering the bank.

644
00:49:11.083 --> 00:49:16.833
I noticed someone wearing an apron.

645
00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:21.625
I zoom in with that camera.
I get it with a camera from the front.

646
00:49:21.708 --> 00:49:24.041
Right when this person starts walking.

647
00:49:24.666 --> 00:49:27.500
you can see a gun at his waist.

648
00:49:51.166 --> 00:49:53.000
I went in. I showed the gun.

649
00:49:54.291 --> 00:49:55.416
Don't move. Let's go.

650
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.833
There were people waiting in line.
so I went…

651
00:49:58.916 --> 00:49:59.875
Freeze.

652
00:49:59.958 --> 00:50:02.416
…restrained the security guard.

653
00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:05.791
I showed people. "All right.
this is a robbery. Everyone on the floor."

654
00:50:05.875 --> 00:50:08.750
On the floor. This is a robbery.
Everyone on the floor.

655
00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:13.916
"Look at the floor
and there won't be any problems."

656
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.416
"Everything will be fine.
but do what we say."

657
00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:18.958
ESTELA MARIS
THE CUSTOMER

658
00:50:19.041 --> 00:50:22.833
I see someone
with a salmon or pink-colored shirt.

659
00:50:22.916 --> 00:50:25.375
I see he has a gun in his hand already.

660
00:50:25.458 --> 00:50:26.291
Let's go.

661
00:50:26.375 --> 00:50:29.583
Then I sound the alarm. I send the alert
that the bank is being robbed.

662
00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:31.666
Second floor.

663
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:34.833
Marito and the Kid take it.

664
00:50:36.625 --> 00:50:37.625
Watch out!

665
00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:40.958
When you start working at the bank.
they give you training

666
00:50:41.041 --> 00:50:43.291
in case these things happen.

667
00:50:43.375 --> 00:50:45.958
What they say in the course
is that the modus operandi

668
00:50:46.041 --> 00:50:49.666
usually is that they're quick. They last
one and a half. two. three minutes.

669
00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:50.875
They're fast.

670
00:50:51.625 --> 00:50:54.958
I remembered that.
I was on the floor and started to count.

671
00:50:55.041 --> 00:50:57.333
LEANDRO
THE BANK EMPLOYEE

672
00:51:31.458 --> 00:51:33.833
I see someone enter
and go towards the ATM.

673
00:51:33.916 --> 00:51:37.958
He had a hat and overalls on.
I run out and grab him. It was Fernando.

674
00:51:38.041 --> 00:51:41.708
I didn't recognize him 'cause
I hadn't seen him dressed like that.

675
00:51:45.416 --> 00:51:48.833
The Kid and I got to the second floor.

676
00:51:55.041 --> 00:51:56.125
Identical operation.

677
00:51:56.208 --> 00:51:58.500
"Everyone on the floor.
This is a robbery."

678
00:52:02.166 --> 00:52:04.666
Two more strides.
and I jumped over the glass.

679
00:52:05.916 --> 00:52:07.958
and landed in the cashier's enclosure.

680
00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:12.333
"The money! Let's go!"

681
00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.291
I'm gonna get the police radio.

682
00:52:15.791 --> 00:52:21.125
I'm gonna listen to exactly
when the police nearby arrive.

683
00:52:21.208 --> 00:52:26.000
At that time.
we're gonna do stage one of the plan:

684
00:52:26.083 --> 00:52:26.916
"Cuckoo."

685
00:52:28.333 --> 00:52:30.125
What I'm gonna do is take a hostage.

686
00:52:30.791 --> 00:52:33.083
wait for the first patrol car to arrive.

687
00:52:33.166 --> 00:52:36.458
and pretend I want to escape
from the bank with him.

688
00:52:41.583 --> 00:52:44.041
I'm gonna wait
until they tell me to stand down.

689
00:52:44.125 --> 00:52:46.041
and I'm gonna go back inside.

690
00:52:47.291 --> 00:52:51.333
And this action is
what's gonna stop them from thinking

691
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.541
we're gonna escape through a tunnel.

692
00:52:53.625 --> 00:52:55.708
'cause if we wanna escape
through the door…

693
00:52:56.625 --> 00:52:58.208
Once "Cuckoo" is done.

694
00:52:58.291 --> 00:53:00.541
we're gonna close the bank door.

695
00:53:00.625 --> 00:53:03.458
and that's when we go to stage two.

696
00:53:05.875 --> 00:53:08.750
And that's when I heard the police siren.

697
00:53:09.833 --> 00:53:14.666
and then you start
having a ton of questions.

698
00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:18.958
because in the end. it's not
an in-and-out robbery. How does this end?

699
00:53:22.208 --> 00:53:23.958
<i>Ultimo momento.</i>

700
00:53:25.166 --> 00:53:28.375
<i>They rob a bank in San Isidro.</i>

701
00:53:34.083 --> 00:53:36.333
Then we move on to stage three.

702
00:53:36.416 --> 00:53:40.750
which is taking out
the guard in the basement.

703
00:53:42.291 --> 00:53:44.833
This guy is the one
communicating with the outside.

704
00:53:44.916 --> 00:53:50.541
He can't see or hear
anything from the vault.

705
00:53:50.625 --> 00:53:53.708
We grabbed the manager.
We went to the bunker.

706
00:53:54.458 --> 00:53:56.041
It was all a matter of seconds.

707
00:53:56.125 --> 00:53:59.666
It sounds like a lot of stuff.
but it was all in seconds.

708
00:53:59.750 --> 00:54:03.208
Come on.
Get out because we're going. All right.

709
00:54:03.291 --> 00:54:08.708
From above. we hear them
start telling the policeman to get out.

710
00:54:09.291 --> 00:54:13.250
He grabs me and says.
"Stay calm. Cop. surrender."

711
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:15.375
I say. "I'm not gonna."

712
00:54:15.458 --> 00:54:19.250
And in no way
did he want to open that door.

713
00:54:19.333 --> 00:54:21.791
In the event that he doesn't want to go…

714
00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:26.458
we're gonna cover the windows

715
00:54:26.541 --> 00:54:31.208
and one of us will drive him crazy
pounding on the windows.

716
00:54:31.958 --> 00:54:33.958
Come out. All right. let's go.

717
00:54:34.041 --> 00:54:37.291
The one in the overalls
gets a little irritated.

718
00:54:37.916 --> 00:54:42.000
He grabs the operations manager
by the hair

719
00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:45.625
and pushes her up against the window
of the bunker door.

720
00:54:45.708 --> 00:54:47.416
I said. "Listen. buddy."

721
00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:49.708
"I just got out of Sierra Chica.

722
00:54:49.791 --> 00:54:52.125
and I'm going back.
so don't make this complicated."

723
00:54:52.208 --> 00:54:57.000
"I give you my word as an old thief
that I will release you immediately."

724
00:54:57.083 --> 00:55:00.000
"I came out to give you my word
I won't kill you." he was saying.

725
00:55:00.083 --> 00:55:03.541
And the girl was telling him
not to leave 'cause they'll kill him.

726
00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:06.833
That was ugly.

727
00:55:09.125 --> 00:55:10.916
And… nothing.

728
00:55:13.708 --> 00:55:17.500
Because he was working every day.
He's a guy who worked with you.

729
00:55:18.208 --> 00:55:19.541
What if they shot him?

730
00:55:24.333 --> 00:55:26.583
Come out of there. Let's go.

731
00:55:27.958 --> 00:55:30.666
The operations manager says. crying.

732
00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:32.875
already having a nervous breakdown.

733
00:55:32.958 --> 00:55:36.333
to turn myself in and she hadn't
spent time with her granddaughter.

734
00:55:36.416 --> 00:55:39.000
They're messing with your friends
and coworkers. you know?

735
00:55:39.083 --> 00:55:42.125
They're threatening to kill one of us.
They're gonna kill another.

736
00:55:42.708 --> 00:55:45.208
It makes you angry.
You feel angry and really helpless.

737
00:55:45.291 --> 00:55:46.458
Let's go.

738
00:55:47.083 --> 00:55:48.166
Tell him to come out.

739
00:55:48.250 --> 00:55:52.416
I say to the person
in the gray suit. "I'll go."

740
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000
"Stay calm. Don't touch the hostages."

741
00:55:55.083 --> 00:55:57.666
"All I ask is that
you don't touch the hostages."

742
00:55:58.625 --> 00:56:00.083
He opened the door.

743
00:56:00.166 --> 00:56:02.625
He put the gun on the table

744
00:56:02.708 --> 00:56:05.083
and the phone. his means of communication.

745
00:56:05.166 --> 00:56:07.083
When I go out.
I put my hands up and surrender.

746
00:56:07.166 --> 00:56:10.083
And he doesn't search me like a rookie.

747
00:56:10.166 --> 00:56:13.833
He searches me like someone
who fully knows what he's doing.

748
00:56:17.333 --> 00:56:19.791
I took his hands.
and we went down the stairs.

749
00:56:19.875 --> 00:56:21.416
I took him to the door.

750
00:56:22.375 --> 00:56:25.750
I put his regulation 9 mm to his back.

751
00:56:26.375 --> 00:56:29.458
I took the magazine out
and flipped the bullet around

752
00:56:30.083 --> 00:56:33.791
to prevent the rapid fire of the gun.

753
00:56:37.250 --> 00:56:40.250
"Go away." "What?" "Go away."
We open the door for him.

754
00:56:45.625 --> 00:56:47.125
And he left. We let him go.

755
00:56:47.208 --> 00:56:48.875
We released the policeman.

756
00:56:48.958 --> 00:56:50.375
I start to have doubts.

757
00:56:50.458 --> 00:56:53.250
"Who are they?
What is the gang armed with?"

758
00:56:53.333 --> 00:56:54.708
"Who did you call?"

759
00:56:55.625 --> 00:56:58.833
Sergeant Serrano couldn't believe

760
00:56:59.375 --> 00:57:02.541
he was gonna walk out of a robbery.

761
00:57:05.958 --> 00:57:08.791
When I got closer to the chief
on the street. I saw the bank.

762
00:57:09.291 --> 00:57:12.333
I look at the second floor.
I see this person in a gray suit

763
00:57:12.416 --> 00:57:14.458
like this. showing a Nextel.

764
00:57:17.958 --> 00:57:20.958
When he shows the Nextel.
I tell Gustavo it's mine.

765
00:57:21.041 --> 00:57:22.916
He says. "How do you know?"
"It has a logo."

766
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.500
I say. "One of my daughters glued it on."

767
00:57:25.583 --> 00:57:27.416
"It's mine. Call it 'cause it's mine."

768
00:57:40.416 --> 00:57:41.375
First.

769
00:57:41.458 --> 00:57:44.416
two people were gonna be
in charge of the negotiation.

770
00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:45.625
the Doc and me.

771
00:57:50.208 --> 00:57:52.625
Later. because I ham it up.

772
00:57:54.083 --> 00:57:55.791
because of how I word things…

773
00:57:57.958 --> 00:57:59.583
my theater studies.

774
00:57:59.666 --> 00:58:02.958
and the way I deal with them.

775
00:58:04.625 --> 00:58:08.833
the Doc said. "No.
Marito has to be the negotiator."

776
00:58:39.875 --> 00:58:41.250
And that's how it went.

777
00:58:46.416 --> 00:58:51.000
A fake mustache. a kippah.
some glasses. and a hood.

778
00:58:54.541 --> 00:58:56.583
In my role as negotiator.

779
00:58:58.416 --> 00:59:00.291
the newspapers started to say…

780
00:59:03.208 --> 00:59:05.166
"The man in the gray suit."

781
00:59:35.166 --> 00:59:36.000
Hello?

782
00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:38.541
Yes. ma'am.

783
00:59:40.333 --> 00:59:42.958
No. ma'am. I'm not Walter Serrano.

784
00:59:44.541 --> 00:59:47.791
But I already freed your husband.
ma'am. so relax.

785
00:59:49.833 --> 00:59:53.375
Yes. ma'am. I'm one of the thieves. Relax.

786
00:59:53.458 --> 00:59:54.916
Calm down. please.

787
00:59:55.416 --> 00:59:57.125
I'm gonna make them call you.

788
00:59:57.791 --> 00:59:59.541
Calm down. ma'am.

789
01:00:00.333 --> 01:00:02.250
Get off this line. please.

790
01:00:04.583 --> 01:00:08.083
Immediately. I slammed
the phone on the glass

791
01:00:09.208 --> 01:00:12.041
so this lieutenant would contact me.

792
01:00:12.125 --> 01:00:13.583
And I said.

793
01:00:14.375 --> 01:00:16.583
"Walter Serrano's wife called me."

794
01:00:16.666 --> 01:00:20.166
"Please tell him to call her
because she's desperate."

795
01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:22.250
Back to our live report

796
01:00:22.333 --> 01:00:24.208
on the bank robbery
with hostages in San Isidro.

797
01:00:24.291 --> 01:00:25.583
BANK ROBBERY
AND HOSTAGES TAKEN

798
01:00:25.666 --> 01:00:28.125
<i>Avenida Libertador</i>
<i>is blocked off for three blocks.</i>

799
01:00:28.208 --> 01:00:29.666
You can't be here. Go back.

800
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:32.916
<i>And this has been restricted</i>
<i>even more for press access.</i>

801
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.208
<i>We've been put</i>
<i>almost a block and a half away</i>

802
01:00:36.708 --> 01:00:38.833
<i>from the middle of the action.</i>

803
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.625
The next step

804
01:00:43.708 --> 01:00:46.041
is to close the parking gate.

805
01:00:46.125 --> 01:00:49.000
Basically. if the police
go in the parking garage.

806
01:00:49.083 --> 01:00:51.458
we won't succeed.

807
01:00:52.208 --> 01:00:55.375
Why? Because we can't get
the "power cannon" out of the car.

808
01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:15.000
After 12:30 p.m..

809
01:01:16.166 --> 01:01:18.291
I feel like they start

810
01:01:18.916 --> 01:01:20.625
to beep me.

811
01:01:20.708 --> 01:01:22.291
and they say. "Break."

812
01:01:23.250 --> 01:01:28.416
I punch and feel like they start
moving things on the other side.

813
01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:31.833
That's because I hit
the back of a piece of furniture.

814
01:01:31.916 --> 01:01:36.125
Then they couldn't find
where the hole I made was.

815
01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:47.250
It's an important moment to see
the weirdo's face through that hole 'cause

816
01:01:48.666 --> 01:01:50.125
it's our escape route.

817
01:02:17.208 --> 01:02:19.250
I got in position there

818
01:02:19.333 --> 01:02:22.625
to work on
the easier deposit boxes. let's say.

819
01:02:22.708 --> 01:02:23.875
What do I mean by easier?

820
01:02:23.958 --> 01:02:26.875
The ones with the least distance
between the hinges and the box.

821
01:02:31.166 --> 01:02:33.250
The time was more or less calculated

822
01:02:33.333 --> 01:02:37.041
to be able to open
400 deposit boxes in two hours.

823
01:02:37.125 --> 01:02:39.250
1:03 PM

824
01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:48.791
<i>We're unaware of the kidnappers' demands</i>

825
01:02:48.875 --> 01:02:52.416
<i>to free the hostages and surrender.</i>

826
01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:57.500
<i>There's a stream</i>
<i>of patrol cars and officers.</i>

827
01:02:57.583 --> 01:03:01.666
<i>but no solution to this issue is in sight.</i>

828
01:03:04.916 --> 01:03:10.541
We were watching a monitor. a TV
without audio. which is in all banks.

829
01:03:10.625 --> 01:03:12.750
The media was already on top of it.

830
01:03:13.625 --> 01:03:16.416
And at that moment. I look out a window

831
01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:19.583
and see the guy with the radio antenna
pointing at me.

832
01:03:20.125 --> 01:03:23.791
But he started to look
to the side. like this.

833
01:03:23.875 --> 01:03:27.416
He'd look at me. look at the radio.
and look to the side.

834
01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:29.000
I said. "What's going on?"

835
01:03:29.791 --> 01:03:32.916
Like an old thief.
I think something's wrong.

836
01:03:33.625 --> 01:03:36.750
He says. "Here comes the person
who's gonna negotiate with you."

837
01:03:36.833 --> 01:03:38.916
"Who is it?"
"The guy with the beard." he says.

838
01:04:01.208 --> 01:04:02.583
Miguel Ángel Sileo.

839
01:04:03.250 --> 01:04:07.500
I was a major in the Falcon Special Forces
for the Buenos Aires police.

840
01:04:08.125 --> 01:04:11.291
I was a negotiator
and a member of the tactical team.

841
01:04:11.958 --> 01:04:15.416
MIGUEL SILEO
THE NEGOTIATOR

842
01:04:19.708 --> 01:04:21.958
We park our cars. like normal.

843
01:04:23.583 --> 01:04:25.958
And they got us up to speed.

844
01:04:27.583 --> 01:04:32.708
They gave me the phone number
to the device inside the bank.

845
01:04:33.833 --> 01:04:37.416
I get behind a kind of truck-like vehicle

846
01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:40.125
with my partner.
who also covers me like a shield.

847
01:04:41.375 --> 01:04:42.458
There I reach out.

848
01:04:43.125 --> 01:04:44.916
And he starts to explain what happened.

849
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.208
It was an in-and-out robbery
that went wrong. and they were trapped.

850
01:04:49.291 --> 01:04:52.333
They didn't want to hurt anyone.
but didn't want to go back to jail either.

851
01:04:52.416 --> 01:04:54.083
"Look. buddy."

852
01:04:54.166 --> 01:04:57.041
"I just did 15 years in Sierra Chica."

853
01:04:57.916 --> 01:05:01.291
"So let's make this short and easy."

854
01:05:01.375 --> 01:05:06.291
The negotiator.
the first-class policeman by profession.

855
01:05:06.375 --> 01:05:09.291
knows I'm a first-class thief
by profession

856
01:05:09.375 --> 01:05:11.250
when I said I was in Sierra Chica.

857
01:05:11.333 --> 01:05:14.250
Beyond what's being said.
I also pay a lot of attention.

858
01:05:14.333 --> 01:05:18.458
as do all the negotiators.
to their non-verbal signs. gestures.

859
01:05:18.541 --> 01:05:22.250
This person was seated
and had crossed his legs.

860
01:05:22.333 --> 01:05:27.125
So his posture didn't match
what was going on at the moment.

861
01:05:27.208 --> 01:05:28.708
BANK ROBBERY:
THEY RELEASE TWO HOSTAGES

862
01:05:28.791 --> 01:05:32.666
Normally when hostages are taken.
there's a lot of stress. adrenaline.

863
01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:34.041
People yell and swear at us.

864
01:05:34.791 --> 01:05:36.000
Listen to one thing.

865
01:05:36.541 --> 01:05:37.666
Listen to me.

866
01:05:38.416 --> 01:05:40.916
Take care of the crisis committee.

867
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.083
so I can take care
of the situation in here. All right?

868
01:05:44.166 --> 01:05:48.208
I said. "Okay. release someone
who's nervous. a victim."

869
01:05:48.291 --> 01:05:50.958
Keep in mind
I got rid of my natural enemy.

870
01:05:51.458 --> 01:05:53.833
I let police officer Walter Serrano go.

871
01:05:53.916 --> 01:05:56.416
That's a gesture of goodwill.

872
01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:59.125
Don't ask for more hostages.
Done. All right.

873
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000
I turn on the cell phone.
We're all looking at each other.

874
01:06:05.083 --> 01:06:07.250
And my boss said.
"Buy us some time. Sileo."

875
01:06:07.333 --> 01:06:09.416
It was the same thing I wanted. time.

876
01:06:10.208 --> 01:06:11.875
Time to open deposit boxes.

877
01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:18.458
I wasn't stopping to see what was in them.

878
01:06:18.541 --> 01:06:22.416
If it could be opened or anything.
I was already onto the second row.

879
01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:26.333
I was meticulous. breaking all the locks.

880
01:06:29.291 --> 01:06:31.875
While I was breaking
all the deposit boxes.

881
01:06:31.958 --> 01:06:35.541
someone from the bank appeared

882
01:06:35.625 --> 01:06:36.791
and yelled at me.

883
01:06:37.583 --> 01:06:39.666
"What are you doing here?"

884
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:44.083
I look at the person like this.
Obviously I had a mask on.

885
01:06:44.166 --> 01:06:45.625
And Fernando says.

886
01:06:45.708 --> 01:06:49.458
"You don't give any more orders.
I give the orders now."

887
01:06:49.541 --> 01:06:53.583
And the person left.
But I was like. "Oops. they got me."

888
01:06:54.208 --> 01:06:58.000
2:17 PM

889
01:06:58.083 --> 01:06:59.625
We had a lot of hostages.

890
01:07:00.416 --> 01:07:02.083
Later. we found out there were 23.

891
01:07:02.166 --> 01:07:03.875
Don't be dumbasses.

892
01:07:04.416 --> 01:07:06.166
There was one who came

893
01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:10.458
and was a little more violent
in the way he was and how he treated you.

894
01:07:11.166 --> 01:07:14.125
Another came saying. "Stay calm.
The district attorney is coming."

895
01:07:14.208 --> 01:07:16.958
"We're negotiating and
turning ourselves in. Stay calm."

896
01:07:17.041 --> 01:07:20.333
There was a really nervous man.
He was about to explode.

897
01:07:20.416 --> 01:07:21.916
He wanted to pee.

898
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.458
He was kind of whining.

899
01:07:23.541 --> 01:07:28.208
"My man?" "I can't go." "Why?"
"Because they're looking at me."

900
01:07:28.291 --> 01:07:31.083
"Well. go on the stairs. buddy. Please."

901
01:07:33.375 --> 01:07:36.625
This situation started
to make people nervous.

902
01:07:36.708 --> 01:07:38.208
"What's wrong. crazy man?"

903
01:07:38.708 --> 01:07:41.083
"I can't go. I'm nervous."

904
01:07:41.166 --> 01:07:43.708
No. buddy. Come on. You're leaving.

905
01:07:43.791 --> 01:07:45.708
All right. come here.

906
01:07:45.791 --> 01:07:47.000
Let's go. Now.

907
01:07:47.083 --> 01:07:50.541
We opened the barricade.
and we threw him out. literally.

908
01:07:50.625 --> 01:07:52.791
Immediately. the elite corps came.

909
01:07:52.875 --> 01:07:55.041
hugged him. threw a few punches.

910
01:07:55.125 --> 01:07:57.583
because they didn't know
if he was a hostage or a thief.

911
01:07:58.166 --> 01:08:00.125
Are you pregnant. ma'am?

912
01:08:00.208 --> 01:08:03.291
Okay. you're leaving. Come here.

913
01:08:04.166 --> 01:08:08.458
<i>There's movement here</i>
<i>in the Río Bank area.</i>

914
01:08:08.541 --> 01:08:11.750
<i>Two people have been released.</i>
<i>a man and a woman.</i>

915
01:08:11.833 --> 01:08:15.500
<i>We're seeing the moment when the woman was</i>

916
01:08:16.416 --> 01:08:21.083
<i>released by the criminals</i>
<i>who were holding hostage</i>

917
01:08:21.791 --> 01:08:24.791
<i>Río Bank employees as well as customers.</i>

918
01:08:24.875 --> 01:08:30.708
<i>We found out there are intense</i>
<i>negotiations with people from the police</i>

919
01:08:30.791 --> 01:08:33.833
<i>who are trying</i>
<i>to convince them to give up.</i>

920
01:08:33.916 --> 01:08:37.416
BANK ROBBERY
THEY FREE TWO HOSTAGES

921
01:08:39.416 --> 01:08:41.166
I had two radios.

922
01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:43.208
One on the police's channel

923
01:08:43.291 --> 01:08:47.791
and another to communicate
with my partners.

924
01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:49.625
And I had another.

925
01:08:50.166 --> 01:08:52.958
which was a really cheap radio.

926
01:08:53.041 --> 01:08:56.958
the kind that comes in a pair.

927
01:08:57.583 --> 01:09:00.208
That radio. which came with channels.

928
01:09:00.291 --> 01:09:02.916
I remember starting to scan

929
01:09:04.250 --> 01:09:07.416
and listen to the Falcon Group.

930
01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:11.208
I remember grabbing Mario
and saying. "Listen to this."

931
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.166
I was listening to the snipers

932
01:09:17.250 --> 01:09:20.541
send info to the head of the operation

933
01:09:20.625 --> 01:09:24.166
and the head of the operation
responding to the snipers.

934
01:09:24.250 --> 01:09:25.458
I heard them say…

935
01:09:26.083 --> 01:09:27.458
"I have the one above."

936
01:09:28.041 --> 01:09:29.500
"I have the one below."

937
01:09:30.541 --> 01:09:34.125
That means if the boss says. "Now."

938
01:09:34.208 --> 01:09:37.333
de la Torre and I
get a bullet in the forehead.

939
01:09:38.333 --> 01:09:41.291
And de la Torre saw them.
He came and took the Nextel from me

940
01:09:41.958 --> 01:09:45.000
and said. "Get those guys down
or I'll kill someone live."

941
01:09:45.083 --> 01:09:46.541
I don't remember the words well.

942
01:09:46.625 --> 01:09:50.041
because we agree it was
an extreme and intense situation.

943
01:09:50.125 --> 01:09:53.750
So those people get off the roof
at the request of the man.

944
01:09:54.333 --> 01:09:57.791
But there were three Falcon snipers.

945
01:09:58.666 --> 01:09:59.500
He never saw them.

946
01:10:00.583 --> 01:10:03.208
3:10 PM

947
01:10:03.291 --> 01:10:08.791
We determined a certain amount of time
for the work at the bank.

948
01:10:08.875 --> 01:10:12.583
Opening the deposit boxes
and moving the hostages.

949
01:10:12.666 --> 01:10:16.500
In that amount of time.
we'd opened 143 deposit boxes.

950
01:10:16.583 --> 01:10:22.583
The others were gonna take the time
to modify the equipment.

951
01:10:22.666 --> 01:10:25.000
all of which we didn't plan for.

952
01:10:25.083 --> 01:10:28.958
So it was decided we were leaving.

953
01:10:29.041 --> 01:10:31.875
Once the two hours were up.

954
01:10:32.541 --> 01:10:39.416
we get in position
to lower the loot as fast as possible.

955
01:10:42.416 --> 01:10:46.666
I get a call from Araujo.

956
01:10:47.291 --> 01:10:49.083
<i>Let's go. Pizza stage.</i>

957
01:10:49.166 --> 01:10:51.583
So I take one more call.

958
01:10:52.458 --> 01:10:54.375
He says they're gonna turn themselves in.

959
01:10:54.458 --> 01:10:57.333
"All right. you're right. buddy.
This isn't going anywhere."

960
01:10:57.416 --> 01:10:58.958
And they wanted

961
01:10:59.833 --> 01:11:01.875
to eat something
because they'd spend many days

962
01:11:01.958 --> 01:11:04.125
at the police station
and wouldn't be able to eat.

963
01:11:04.208 --> 01:11:05.875
"Bring me some pizzas."

964
01:11:05.958 --> 01:11:09.041
"Bring me some sodas.
We'll eat and turn ourselves in."

965
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.791
I clarify they weren't fugazzettas.

966
01:11:13.875 --> 01:11:17.791
In a report. I think one of them said.
"If I ask Sileo for a fugazzetta.

967
01:11:17.875 --> 01:11:20.000
five fugazzettas.
he'll realize there are five of us.

968
01:11:20.083 --> 01:11:22.583
and in five minutes enter the bank."
It was gonna be like that.

969
01:11:22.666 --> 01:11:26.500
From that point.
once his request was received

970
01:11:26.583 --> 01:11:29.416
and the exchange was to be made.
communication was lost.

971
01:11:38.083 --> 01:11:40.041
What am I gonna do in the meantime?

972
01:11:40.541 --> 01:11:45.833
I'm gonna put the guns
that I'm gonna be leaving in the vault.

973
01:11:47.708 --> 01:11:51.375
And I'm on to the "Hair Bleach" stage.

974
01:11:51.958 --> 01:11:56.416
This is five liters of bleach
spilled to avoid DNA.

975
01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:57.625
And this is the hair.

976
01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:05.375
I'm the last one out with Araujo.

977
01:12:05.458 --> 01:12:11.041
With a rope. he wedges his foot down
and brings the piece of furniture.

978
01:12:20.916 --> 01:12:22.958
García Bolster tried starting…

979
01:12:24.250 --> 01:12:25.333
He couldn't get it to start.

980
01:12:28.916 --> 01:12:32.041
And Vitette was really nervous

981
01:12:32.125 --> 01:12:36.083
and started going. "Don't put
starter fluid in it. You'll flood it."

982
01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:41.958
With the loot and a motor
that won't start. I go crazy.

983
01:12:42.875 --> 01:12:45.375
Vitette tried to start the motor

984
01:12:45.458 --> 01:12:48.500
and couldn't get it to start.
so they start to row.

985
01:12:53.041 --> 01:12:56.250
We were all going in the one up front.
which had the motor.

986
01:12:56.333 --> 01:13:02.125
except Araujo who was gonna
take the alternative inflatable raft.

987
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.625
I remember throwing myself
in the rear raft

988
01:13:09.333 --> 01:13:10.666
on top of the money.

989
01:13:10.750 --> 01:13:14.208
Over bags and bags of money. like this.

990
01:13:15.416 --> 01:13:17.833
We passed by a sewer
really close to the bank.

991
01:13:17.916 --> 01:13:19.916
We saw shadows and heard sounds.

992
01:13:20.541 --> 01:13:23.625
And suddenly. the motor started.

993
01:13:28.708 --> 01:13:33.541
We went the last 14 blocks
with the motor running.

994
01:13:37.125 --> 01:13:40.083
We warned the other partner.
the Countryman. who was up above.

995
01:13:40.166 --> 01:13:42.333
that we were already below.

996
01:13:42.416 --> 01:13:46.083
So he lifted the cover above
with a rod 'cause it was heavy.

997
01:13:48.375 --> 01:13:50.791
I think I was the last to arrive.

998
01:13:50.875 --> 01:13:53.166
They were all in the truck.

999
01:13:53.250 --> 01:13:54.750
Nothing else would fit.

1000
01:13:54.833 --> 01:13:56.708
just people and bags.

1001
01:14:04.250 --> 01:14:05.583
We'll load the loot.

1002
01:14:08.083 --> 01:14:09.083
And voilà.

1003
01:14:15.708 --> 01:14:19.625
We had everyone in a caravan
going to where we'd split the money.

1004
01:14:23.250 --> 01:14:28.000
My idea is they were barricading
the entrances and were gonna resist.

1005
01:14:29.250 --> 01:14:31.125
We no longer heard any noise.

1006
01:14:31.208 --> 01:14:32.666
There was no one.

1007
01:14:33.208 --> 01:14:35.000
We started to look at each other.

1008
01:14:35.583 --> 01:14:39.500
I was thinking they're gonna pose
as hostages and change their clothes.

1009
01:14:39.583 --> 01:14:41.541
They're upstairs waiting for the police.

1010
01:14:46.333 --> 01:14:48.666
We arrive at the place
where a gate opened.

1011
01:14:49.416 --> 01:14:51.375
and we started unloading the bags.

1012
01:14:52.166 --> 01:14:53.541
And bags…

1013
01:14:53.625 --> 01:14:56.375
I didn't want to mess with your fantasy.

1014
01:14:56.458 --> 01:14:57.708
And more bags.

1015
01:14:57.791 --> 01:15:01.250
Right away in the beginning.
I wanted to turn on the TV

1016
01:15:01.333 --> 01:15:02.708
to see where they were.

1017
01:15:02.791 --> 01:15:05.375
The Falcon Group still hadn't gone inside.

1018
01:15:05.458 --> 01:15:09.416
We had all the bags in that place.

1019
01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.208
And suddenly.

1020
01:15:16.291 --> 01:15:17.916
"At this time. they're going in…"

1021
01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.625
And we saw live

1022
01:15:20.708 --> 01:15:24.750
how the group was going in to catch us.

1023
01:15:26.875 --> 01:15:28.416
"Police!"

1024
01:15:29.166 --> 01:15:31.500
The door opened. and we went in.

1025
01:15:31.583 --> 01:15:33.666
I thought I was
going into combat at that moment.

1026
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:36.541
THEY RELEASE THE HOSTAGES

1027
01:15:36.625 --> 01:15:39.083
<i>7:12 p.m.. we can see movement</i>

1028
01:15:39.166 --> 01:15:43.458
<i>of police officers</i>
<i>and the Falcon Group who are going in.</i>

1029
01:15:43.541 --> 01:15:44.958
A mallet to the window.

1030
01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:47.375
and in two seconds
they took over the branch.

1031
01:15:49.583 --> 01:15:51.875
This is where
you start to classify who is who.

1032
01:15:52.875 --> 01:15:54.333
They're all suspects.

1033
01:15:56.041 --> 01:15:58.125
They searched all of us.

1034
01:15:58.208 --> 01:15:59.833
with our hands up.

1035
01:16:00.708 --> 01:16:04.291
And when we left.
my mom was outside with her husband.

1036
01:16:04.916 --> 01:16:07.666
And. well. they let them see us.
Nothing else.

1037
01:16:10.625 --> 01:16:13.791
I found my husband and my son.

1038
01:16:14.583 --> 01:16:16.541
A really emotional moment.

1039
01:16:18.083 --> 01:16:21.791
<i>Anabella. the criminals.</i>
<i>the four criminals. were they arrested?</i>

1040
01:16:21.875 --> 01:16:25.166
<i>What happened exactly?</i>
<i>What do you know from there?</i>

1041
01:16:25.250 --> 01:16:28.458
<i>Yes. the four criminals were subdued</i>

1042
01:16:28.541 --> 01:16:32.125
<i>who were found taking this bank branch.</i>

1043
01:16:32.208 --> 01:16:34.958
<i>It just ended recently.</i>

1044
01:16:35.041 --> 01:16:39.833
<i>moments ago at exactly 7:20 p.m.</i>

1045
01:16:39.916 --> 01:16:43.666
They started classifying people
as bank employees and customers.

1046
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:47.000
Well. the line started to get shorter
until there wasn't anyone else.

1047
01:16:49.541 --> 01:16:53.833
I remember we put
all the money to the side.

1048
01:16:53.916 --> 01:16:56.333
A hundred thousand dollars.
we made a little pile.

1049
01:16:56.958 --> 01:17:00.916
A hundred thousand dollars. A little pile.

1050
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.166
The room started to come along.

1051
01:17:03.250 --> 01:17:06.041
At one point. I was sitting on a mountain.

1052
01:17:06.958 --> 01:17:10.333
a mountain of bundles of $10.000.

1053
01:17:10.416 --> 01:17:13.708
<i>In San Isidro.</i>
<i>the hostage situation is over.</i>

1054
01:17:13.791 --> 01:17:16.541
<i>We're live after seven hours.</i>

1055
01:17:16.625 --> 01:17:18.875
<i>The hostages are free.</i>
<i>and no criminals have been arrested.</i>

1056
01:17:18.958 --> 01:17:20.458
HOSTAGES FREED
THE THIEVES HAVE ESCAPED

1057
01:17:20.541 --> 01:17:23.916
"It's all here. Great!
What joy! Let's split it."

1058
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.416
Someone said. "A calculator?"
No. buddy. No calculators.

1059
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.500
We did the math.
and I remember there was $20 left over.

1060
01:17:31.583 --> 01:17:33.375
And since there was $20 left

1061
01:17:33.458 --> 01:17:36.291
and there were five of us
and we didn't have change.

1062
01:17:36.375 --> 01:17:37.833
Vitette tore it up.

1063
01:17:42.291 --> 01:17:44.875
There were people looking in the rooms.

1064
01:17:44.958 --> 01:17:48.250
because people were
cleared out of the bank one by one.

1065
01:17:48.333 --> 01:17:52.583
When someone says. "This piece
of furniture doesn't go there."

1066
01:17:53.250 --> 01:17:56.291
they realize.
They move the furniture and find the hole.

1067
01:17:58.625 --> 01:18:00.750
-Where are you going?
-To the left.

1068
01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:07.000
The boss wants to go in.
There's a homemade door and a booby trap.

1069
01:18:07.708 --> 01:18:11.083
The explosives brigade is called in.
specialists in this area.

1070
01:18:11.166 --> 01:18:14.583
<i>The four criminals escaped</i>

1071
01:18:14.666 --> 01:18:18.875
<i>through the bank's storm drain</i>
<i>with the loot.</i>

1072
01:18:18.958 --> 01:18:21.833
<i>Anabella. I mean. here we're getting</i>
<i>complete misinformation.</i>

1073
01:18:21.916 --> 01:18:25.083
<i>They even gave versions</i>
<i>of the arrest of the four criminals.</i>

1074
01:18:25.166 --> 01:18:27.750
<i>only to now say</i>
<i>they escaped with the loot.</i>

1075
01:18:27.833 --> 01:18:30.875
They tell us
there are people in the trees.

1076
01:18:30.958 --> 01:18:32.708
and we're gonna look in the trees.

1077
01:18:32.791 --> 01:18:36.291
They say there are people in the water.
we'll ask the coast guard to help.

1078
01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:41.958
It'd be around five.

1079
01:18:42.583 --> 01:18:44.583
it was clearing up.

1080
01:18:46.458 --> 01:18:50.250
At home. all relaxed. the TV had no idea.

1081
01:18:50.750 --> 01:18:53.166
The question was.
"How much did they take?"

1082
01:18:53.250 --> 01:18:55.875
No! "Where are the thieves?"

1083
01:18:55.958 --> 01:19:00.250
We all wanted to go. I imagine.
I wanted to go. They all wanted to go.

1084
01:19:00.333 --> 01:19:03.833
So everyone grabbed
what was theirs and left.

1085
01:19:03.916 --> 01:19:08.958
Really. there wasn't even a goodbye.
"See you tomorrow." No.

1086
01:19:09.041 --> 01:19:11.083
We go and go
and don't see each other again.

1087
01:19:28.166 --> 01:19:31.208
So we said goodbye forever.

1088
01:19:33.458 --> 01:19:36.666
We took my truck and went with the Kid.

1089
01:19:44.208 --> 01:19:48.875
We left on the Pan American Highway
in my truck with the windows open

1090
01:19:50.166 --> 01:19:51.791
and the music turned up.

1091
01:19:53.166 --> 01:19:55.541
And in the seat in back were four bags.

1092
01:19:55.625 --> 01:20:00.500
His was a little smaller than mine.
but four garbage bags full of money.

1093
01:20:11.625 --> 01:20:16.833
I went in my car to get the bag.
put it in my trunk. and went home.

1094
01:20:25.416 --> 01:20:28.250
I'm a really calm person.

1095
01:20:28.333 --> 01:20:29.750
No…

1096
01:20:30.416 --> 01:20:33.041
It's not like
then I went to a crazy party.

1097
01:20:33.125 --> 01:20:37.000
No. I stayed at home
and had a ton of money.

1098
01:20:40.791 --> 01:20:43.250
I took the Kid. dropped him off.
and we said goodbye.

1099
01:20:43.333 --> 01:20:45.583
From there I went back a few blocks

1100
01:20:45.666 --> 01:20:47.833
and went to Santa Fe 2590

1101
01:20:47.916 --> 01:20:50.625
where I lived
on the 13th floor in apartment 47.

1102
01:20:52.958 --> 01:20:57.166
I went to my bedroom. took off my clothes.

1103
01:20:57.250 --> 01:20:59.083
I went for a walk and washed up.

1104
01:20:59.166 --> 01:21:03.166
I don't even think I dried off.
and I just opened those bags.

1105
01:21:06.875 --> 01:21:10.166
I just had real contact with the money

1106
01:21:10.250 --> 01:21:12.583
by having so much money in my hands.

1107
01:21:12.666 --> 01:21:15.041
But it wasn't mine. It was everyone's.

1108
01:21:15.125 --> 01:21:21.500
But now this. that I had here
at my house. was mine.

1109
01:21:30.041 --> 01:21:33.458
I arrived and I think it was my birthday.
They were all waiting.

1110
01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.250
Mainly Alicia. her eyes wide like this.

1111
01:21:42.125 --> 01:21:43.791
The feeling in the moment

1112
01:21:44.458 --> 01:21:49.875
is that I left the bag of money there
and everyone was looking at me.

1113
01:21:50.833 --> 01:21:52.041
And now what?

1114
01:21:59.166 --> 01:22:03.375
I couldn't sleep for two days.

1115
01:22:11.250 --> 01:22:15.125
We had talked about
how Araujo wanted a little poster.

1116
01:22:15.625 --> 01:22:20.333
I tell him. "If the police see the poster.
it's because we left."

1117
01:22:20.416 --> 01:22:23.458
"If we left. we're counting money."

1118
01:22:23.541 --> 01:22:26.583
"And if we're counting money.
why provoke them?"

1119
01:22:26.666 --> 01:22:28.166
"Pull their tail?"

1120
01:22:34.375 --> 01:22:38.708
<i>They left the traces of a fake escape</i>
<i>and booby-trap bombs</i>

1121
01:22:38.791 --> 01:22:43.250
<i>and a message mixed with irony</i>
<i>and the search for popular significance</i>

1122
01:22:43.333 --> 01:22:44.541
<i>which said…</i>

1123
01:22:44.625 --> 01:22:45.833
In a rich man's neighborhood…

1124
01:22:45.916 --> 01:22:46.875
Without guns or grudges…

1125
01:22:46.958 --> 01:22:48.041
It's only money…

1126
01:22:48.125 --> 01:22:49.333
And no love.

1127
01:22:49.416 --> 01:22:53.000
IN A RICH MAN'S NEIGHBORHOOD
WITHOUT GUNS OR GRUDGES.

1128
01:22:53.083 --> 01:22:56.458
IT'S ONLY MONEY AND NO LOVE

1129
01:22:56.541 --> 01:22:58.750
One of the main things

1130
01:22:58.833 --> 01:23:01.625
that thieves always have.
and this is why they go down.

1131
01:23:01.708 --> 01:23:04.208
is ego and vanity.

1132
01:23:04.708 --> 01:23:09.791
After such a robbery. do you think
these guys aren't gonna talk about it?

1133
01:23:10.375 --> 01:23:14.916
Last Friday the 13th was a dark Friday.
as the superstition goes. you might say.

1134
01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:19.083
They didn't take long
to suspect corrupt police officers

1135
01:23:19.166 --> 01:23:22.333
in the face of
a string of violent acts in the suburbs.

1136
01:23:22.416 --> 01:23:25.041
<i>No matter how much they search.</i>
<i>they can't find them.</i>

1137
01:23:25.125 --> 01:23:29.916
<i>The work of investigators</i>
<i>has collided with a flawless plan so far.</i>

1138
01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.416
<i>The Río Bank thieves</i>
<i>have left nothing to chance.</i>

1139
01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:34.916
Maybe they were really smart guys.

1140
01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.291
COMMISSIONER OSVALDO SEISDEDOS

1141
01:23:36.375 --> 01:23:39.958
But we at the Ministry of Security.
in the justice system. and at the police.

1142
01:23:40.041 --> 01:23:43.000
also have very intelligent investigators.

1143
01:23:43.083 --> 01:23:46.000
and no matter how long it takes.
these individuals will be arrested

1144
01:23:46.083 --> 01:23:49.416
and will have a nice story
to tell their cellmates.

1145
01:23:54.708 --> 01:23:57.458
I planned my vacation

1146
01:23:57.541 --> 01:24:00.708
to the same place I've gone my whole life.

1147
01:24:01.958 --> 01:24:04.083
I knew everything had turned out perfect.

1148
01:24:04.166 --> 01:24:05.833
No one had seen me.

1149
01:24:05.916 --> 01:24:08.833
I had not been recorded on any camera.

1150
01:24:08.916 --> 01:24:13.958
I was really calm.
Let's say. I thought there was no risk.

1151
01:24:33.083 --> 01:24:34.541
After 15 days.

1152
01:24:35.041 --> 01:24:38.791
what I had expected started.
going to San Juan.

1153
01:24:40.250 --> 01:24:42.875
TO BAUCHAZETA

1154
01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:58.958
I went with alpine equipment.

1155
01:24:59.041 --> 01:25:02.250
cans of tuna.

1156
01:25:03.041 --> 01:25:07.208
books by Osho. and a police scanner.

1157
01:25:31.083 --> 01:25:34.291
The weeks after the crime.

1158
01:25:35.708 --> 01:25:37.000
I came to Uruguay.

1159
01:25:38.333 --> 01:25:42.708
I made the rounds to see my family.
did some good deeds.

1160
01:25:47.250 --> 01:25:50.375
I was free. I had money. It was the best.

1161
01:25:52.833 --> 01:25:54.625
GOLD

1162
01:25:57.208 --> 01:25:59.416
<i>Love</i>

1163
01:26:08.666 --> 01:26:11.250
I had the cell phone shop
that was doing really well.

1164
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:16.083
For her part. Alicia also had her work.
The two stores were working.

1165
01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:24.208
I started walking around
to start getting rid of evidence.

1166
01:26:29.666 --> 01:26:31.083
One day. I come

1167
01:26:31.166 --> 01:26:34.375
and I find my bag's out of place.
"What happened here?"

1168
01:26:34.458 --> 01:26:39.333
I saw there were
considerably fewer bundles of dollars.

1169
01:26:39.416 --> 01:26:41.041
"Listen. Did you take something?"

1170
01:26:41.125 --> 01:26:44.333
"Yeah. I took
five or six little bags with me."

1171
01:26:44.416 --> 01:26:46.625
Five little bags was 300.000 dollars.

1172
01:26:48.750 --> 01:26:53.791
The days passed. Another day. I put
some sterling pounds in a drawer too.

1173
01:26:55.666 --> 01:26:57.875
One day I open the drawer.
and they were gone.

1174
01:26:57.958 --> 01:26:59.125
"No. I also took them."

1175
01:26:59.208 --> 01:27:01.916
"You don't have to touch anything."
And an argument started.

1176
01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.291
"Bring them back." "No."
"Bring it back now." "No.

1177
01:27:05.833 --> 01:27:07.583
An argument. I left home.

1178
01:27:07.666 --> 01:27:10.625
I take what was left. go somewhere else.
and she calls the cops on me.

1179
01:27:11.416 --> 01:27:12.250
<i>I saw him.</i>

1180
01:27:12.333 --> 01:27:13.166
COURTHOUSE
SAN ISIDRO

1181
01:27:13.250 --> 01:27:16.583
<i>The cameras pointed at the bank.</i>
<i>and he was going up the stairs.</i>

1182
01:27:16.666 --> 01:27:18.666
<i>I recognized his clothes</i>
<i>and I recognized him.</i>

1183
01:27:18.750 --> 01:27:19.708
ALICIA DI TULLIO'S VOICE

1184
01:27:19.791 --> 01:27:21.875
<i>Eighteen years with someone…</i>

1185
01:27:21.958 --> 01:27:24.041
<i>I couldn't see his face.</i>
<i>but I knew it was him.</i>

1186
01:27:24.125 --> 01:27:26.833
Alicia Di Tullio was
a confidential witness.

1187
01:27:26.916 --> 01:27:30.125
who spontaneously appeared
at the prosecutor's office.

1188
01:27:31.416 --> 01:27:34.375
claiming she knew the facts.

1189
01:27:34.458 --> 01:27:35.791
GASTÓN GARBUS
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY

1190
01:27:35.875 --> 01:27:38.916
Specifically. that her husband
had participated in the heist

1191
01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:42.916
and that she knew
where some of the loot was.

1192
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.458
In the lawsuit.
there was no objective evidence

1193
01:27:45.541 --> 01:27:49.041
that allowed us to say
what happened between them.

1194
01:27:49.125 --> 01:27:51.250
I sense it has to do with money.

1195
01:27:51.333 --> 01:27:56.625
and not out of spite
because there was another woman.

1196
01:27:56.708 --> 01:28:00.375
There was this whole theory of resentment.
which is a huge lie.

1197
01:28:00.458 --> 01:28:05.666
If I had another woman. I'd go by.
leave her some money. and leave.

1198
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:09.250
I wasn't going anywhere
without my wife and son. but okay.

1199
01:28:09.333 --> 01:28:11.500
She thought otherwise.

1200
01:28:11.583 --> 01:28:13.791
She valued money more than family.

1201
01:28:13.875 --> 01:28:14.875
And that's how it was.

1202
01:28:14.958 --> 01:28:19.958
That's the tragic outcome of my story.

1203
01:28:20.041 --> 01:28:21.791
Well. I think. of everyone's.

1204
01:28:23.458 --> 01:28:25.875
Di Tullio describes everyone

1205
01:28:26.666 --> 01:28:29.875
and avoids giving names.

1206
01:28:35.291 --> 01:28:39.750
I went with my daughter
and young grandchildren to a beach house.

1207
01:28:40.333 --> 01:28:42.000
And I took two phones.

1208
01:28:42.083 --> 01:28:45.083
One from Uruguay
and another from Argentina.

1209
01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:49.708
Then my Argentinian phone rings.

1210
01:28:49.791 --> 01:28:51.500
and my alarms went off.

1211
01:28:54.041 --> 01:28:55.791
"Hello?" The Doc.

1212
01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.625
"Beto's wife is betraying us."

1213
01:29:00.291 --> 01:29:03.708
"She wants us all
to give her 300.000 dollars each."

1214
01:29:03.791 --> 01:29:05.875
"Otherwise. she'll turn us in."

1215
01:29:05.958 --> 01:29:09.208
"Doc. she can go fuck herself.
I'm not giving her anything."

1216
01:29:09.291 --> 01:29:12.208
"Let Beto fix what he has to with her.
Don't get me involved."

1217
01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:17.500
But I was left
with the uneasiness of the decision.

1218
01:29:19.125 --> 01:29:22.541
<i>The man arrested</i>
<i>was identified as Alberto Torre.</i>

1219
01:29:22.625 --> 01:29:24.875
<i>who spent almost 20 of his 52 years</i>

1220
01:29:24.958 --> 01:29:28.375
<i>in prison for armed robberies</i>
<i>and kidnappings for ransom.</i>

1221
01:29:29.375 --> 01:29:33.125
<i>At Portela 56.</i>
<i>home of the son of one of the detainees.</i>

1222
01:29:33.208 --> 01:29:34.916
<i>part of the loot was found.</i>

1223
01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.916
<i>938.700 dollars.</i>

1224
01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:42.416
<i>30.084 euros. and 80.315 pesos.</i>

1225
01:29:42.916 --> 01:29:45.458
We're carrying out seven raids

1226
01:29:45.541 --> 01:29:48.708
in the capital city
and province of Buenos Aires.

1227
01:29:48.791 --> 01:29:53.791
Long guns and handguns have been seized.
All of them were used in the bank robbery.

1228
01:29:53.875 --> 01:29:56.333
This is an intelligence war.
and we intend to win.

1229
01:30:00.375 --> 01:30:02.916
The fact that Di Tullio
provided some information

1230
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:07.291
that made some raids
happen earlier than others

1231
01:30:07.375 --> 01:30:12.625
doesn't imply the line of investigation
just started with Di Tullio.

1232
01:30:13.291 --> 01:30:15.125
The first pieces of evidence

1233
01:30:15.208 --> 01:30:20.833
came from a phone number
the perpetrators give to a media outlet.

1234
01:30:20.916 --> 01:30:24.583
That phone had an impact
on some phone covers.

1235
01:30:24.666 --> 01:30:28.333
And those covers at one time
had other chips.

1236
01:30:28.833 --> 01:30:32.875
And a phone comes up
that kept communication

1237
01:30:32.958 --> 01:30:35.541
with Vitette Sellanes' family in Uruguay.

1238
01:30:35.625 --> 01:30:40.208
with de la Torre's phone shop.and a phone
in Sebastián García Bolster's name.

1239
01:30:52.041 --> 01:30:54.583
If Di Tullio hadn't talked.

1240
01:30:54.666 --> 01:30:57.166
maybe someone would have later.

1241
01:30:58.375 --> 01:31:04.583
But I was imagining it'd be
a few years later. not a few months.

1242
01:31:07.791 --> 01:31:10.958
<i>After all this.</i>
<i>the man arrested last Saturday</i>

1243
01:31:11.041 --> 01:31:15.583
<i>will be investigated by the district</i>
<i>attorney in charge. Dr. Jorge Apolo.</i>

1244
01:31:15.666 --> 01:31:19.208
<i>We're talking about</i>
<i>52-year-old Alberto de la Torre.</i>

1245
01:31:20.125 --> 01:31:24.250
I automatically said.
"How much does Di Tullio know about me?"

1246
01:31:24.333 --> 01:31:30.083
I remember only having seen her once
when we went to get the truck ready.

1247
01:31:30.166 --> 01:31:34.250
So I was pretty calm in a way.

1248
01:31:35.041 --> 01:31:37.375
But after a few weeks.

1249
01:31:37.458 --> 01:31:41.083
they arrested Sebastián at Villa Gesell.

1250
01:31:42.291 --> 01:31:48.041
<i>This is Sebastián Bolster. the man accused</i>

1251
01:31:48.125 --> 01:31:51.000
<i>of collaborating with the criminals</i>

1252
01:31:51.625 --> 01:31:57.583
<i>to perfect and construct</i>
<i>the tunnel used to commit the robbery</i>

1253
01:31:57.666 --> 01:32:01.041
<i>at the Río Bank branch in Acassuso.</i>

1254
01:32:04.708 --> 01:32:08.750
I was looking for
the little red dot on my body.

1255
01:32:08.833 --> 01:32:11.833
because I imagined them
already targeting me

1256
01:32:11.916 --> 01:32:14.125
and that they were gonna come for me.

1257
01:32:16.833 --> 01:32:20.791
What I did was wait. Through my lawyers.

1258
01:32:20.875 --> 01:32:23.750
I got access to the proceedings

1259
01:32:23.833 --> 01:32:26.666
and was finally able to see
what legal action to take.

1260
01:32:28.416 --> 01:32:31.500
As the days passed.
I decided to lose weight.

1261
01:32:34.375 --> 01:32:38.708
I was 110 kilos on D-Day.

1262
01:32:39.916 --> 01:32:40.958
Therefore.

1263
01:32:41.041 --> 01:32:45.416
knowing it was very possible
I'd be in a lineup.

1264
01:32:46.166 --> 01:32:53.041
I started a strict training regimen
and diet to lose weight.

1265
01:32:59.291 --> 01:33:04.000
<i>The truck with the hole was found</i>
<i>completely burnt in Alejandro Korn.</i>

1266
01:33:04.083 --> 01:33:09.000
<i>blocks away from the house where</i>
<i>fat Julián was arrested last Saturday.</i>

1267
01:33:09.083 --> 01:33:12.666
<i>the man who had driven</i>
<i>the day of the robbery.</i>

1268
01:33:12.750 --> 01:33:16.041
<i>After 30 days under arrest.</i>
<i>Sebastián García Bolster</i>

1269
01:33:16.125 --> 01:33:18.250
<i>spent the night at his father's house.</i>

1270
01:33:18.333 --> 01:33:19.500
What's your occupation?

1271
01:33:19.583 --> 01:33:20.833
I fix Jet Skis.

1272
01:33:20.916 --> 01:33:26.958
My whole life. I've gone to the river
to try Jet Skis. This is all so crazy.

1273
01:33:27.041 --> 01:33:29.708
<i>Regarding his alleged escape</i>
<i>to Villa Gesell.</i>

1274
01:33:29.791 --> 01:33:31.708
<i>where he was finally arrested.</i>

1275
01:33:31.791 --> 01:33:35.375
<i>he said it was a regular family outing.</i>

1276
01:33:36.208 --> 01:33:38.375
I called my lawyers in Argentina

1277
01:33:39.833 --> 01:33:42.041
and told them to put me straight.

1278
01:33:48.750 --> 01:33:53.166
<i>He boarded a plane.</i>
<i>Aerolíneas Argentinas flight 1213</i>

1279
01:33:53.250 --> 01:33:55.458
<i>left at 8:00 a.m. from Montevideo.</i>

1280
01:33:55.541 --> 01:33:58.583
<i>But the welcome took place at Aeroparque.</i>

1281
01:33:58.666 --> 01:34:02.125
I was in Uruguay
when they robbed the bank!

1282
01:34:02.208 --> 01:34:05.083
I was in Montevideo
when they robbed the bank!

1283
01:34:05.166 --> 01:34:08.375
-Why did you turn yourself in. Mario?
-Why. Mario?

1284
01:34:09.083 --> 01:34:10.958
Is he the famous man in the gray suit?

1285
01:34:11.041 --> 01:34:12.000
Yes. indeed.

1286
01:34:12.083 --> 01:34:13.708
This is the man in the gray suit.

1287
01:34:13.791 --> 01:34:16.708
the gang leader. and the mastermind
of this criminal operation

1288
01:34:16.791 --> 01:34:18.625
that took place at the bank in Acassuso.

1289
01:34:23.958 --> 01:34:27.833
And so days passed
until my file got to me.

1290
01:34:28.875 --> 01:34:31.000
It was eight volumes.

1291
01:34:31.083 --> 01:34:33.625
Each volume was 200 pages.

1292
01:34:33.708 --> 01:34:36.166
It was 1.600 pages.

1293
01:34:36.875 --> 01:34:38.458
And trust me.

1294
01:34:39.041 --> 01:34:43.583
I've never read something
with as much passion

1295
01:34:44.250 --> 01:34:46.083
as I read that file.

1296
01:34:51.250 --> 01:34:53.125
I wanted to know what had happened

1297
01:34:53.208 --> 01:34:56.166
after such a plan
that went like clockwork.

1298
01:34:57.166 --> 01:34:58.541
What went wrong?

1299
01:35:04.041 --> 01:35:07.291
And suddenly I realized
they had an arrest warrant out for me.

1300
01:35:10.708 --> 01:35:15.166
I see a green car from my hideout.

1301
01:35:17.625 --> 01:35:20.791
And I see two people
starting to walk towards me.

1302
01:35:22.375 --> 01:35:25.833
Suddenly he points an automatic rifle
at me and says. "National Gendarmerie."

1303
01:35:27.791 --> 01:35:31.416
"What are you doing here?" they ask me.
"A spiritual retreat." I say.

1304
01:35:32.166 --> 01:35:36.083
But deep down.
I knew it was a lost cause. Why?

1305
01:35:36.166 --> 01:35:39.625
Basically because I had
eight volumes of my file there.

1306
01:35:40.375 --> 01:35:42.125
"Can we check the tent?"

1307
01:35:44.500 --> 01:35:45.375
"All right."

1308
01:35:45.875 --> 01:35:47.541
Before he checks. I say.

1309
01:35:47.625 --> 01:35:51.625
"Don't waste your time.
I'm Fernando Araujo."

1310
01:35:51.708 --> 01:35:54.791
Araujo. were you alone
when the National Gendarmerie found you?

1311
01:35:54.875 --> 01:35:56.083
Art.

1312
01:35:56.583 --> 01:35:58.375
-What? You were making art?
-Art.

1313
01:35:58.458 --> 01:36:00.333
ROBBERY AT RÍO BANK
FUGITIVE ARRESTED IN SAN JUAN

1314
01:36:00.416 --> 01:36:01.583
What kind of art?

1315
01:36:01.666 --> 01:36:02.916
Tell us.

1316
01:36:03.458 --> 01:36:04.916
There it is. All right.

1317
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.958
<i>All right. without making any statements.</i>
<i>Araujo got in the truck.</i>

1318
01:36:08.041 --> 01:36:10.708
<i>heavily guarded</i>
<i>by the National Gendarmerie.</i>

1319
01:36:10.791 --> 01:36:13.875
<i>which will transfer him</i>
<i>to Jáchal Police Station 21</i>

1320
01:36:13.958 --> 01:36:17.791
<i>where he will surely be interviewed</i>
<i>by Judge Carlos Mateo.</i>

1321
01:36:35.708 --> 01:36:41.500
Overnight. I appear at
the San Isidro Office of Investigations.

1322
01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:45.458
But I was calm.

1323
01:36:48.791 --> 01:36:49.791
Feet together.

1324
01:36:54.291 --> 01:36:57.708
I was incredibly at peace.
Don't ask me why. exactly.

1325
01:36:58.375 --> 01:37:04.625
but what happened next was.
in a way. a natural balance.

1326
01:37:10.208 --> 01:37:12.458
I got the worst
district attorney's office.

1327
01:37:12.541 --> 01:37:13.708
Up.

1328
01:37:14.250 --> 01:37:17.250
But I also got
a really good supervisory judge.

1329
01:37:19.625 --> 01:37:22.916
And he says. "Fernando.
I'm gonna let you off."

1330
01:37:23.416 --> 01:37:25.250
"I'm not putting
an electronic bracelet on you."

1331
01:37:25.333 --> 01:37:27.750
"It's house arrest.
but you can go work every day at the gym

1332
01:37:27.833 --> 01:37:29.666
to give martial arts classes."

1333
01:37:31.666 --> 01:37:33.833
Start of the shoulder blade.

1334
01:37:33.916 --> 01:37:35.708
Obviously. the shoulder blade
here determines…

1335
01:37:35.791 --> 01:37:38.458
But he escapes
and realizes what I'm gonna do to him.

1336
01:37:38.541 --> 01:37:43.375
And. like. 20 days later.
I was suddenly at home. free.

1337
01:37:44.208 --> 01:37:45.541
And I was like this

1338
01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:48.666
for four years.

1339
01:37:57.541 --> 01:38:00.458
<i>Four years later. all those involved</i>

1340
01:38:00.541 --> 01:38:03.125
<i>will appear before the court to be judged</i>

1341
01:38:03.208 --> 01:38:05.541
<i>for what's called</i>
<i>"the robbery of the century."</i>

1342
01:38:06.583 --> 01:38:08.416
2010. trial.

1343
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.041
Beto. Zallo. me. Seba.

1344
01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:21.500
Marito was in another trial.
which was later shortened.

1345
01:38:22.250 --> 01:38:26.541
<i>The four are accused</i>
<i>of both aggravated and armed robbery</i>

1346
01:38:26.625 --> 01:38:28.416
<i>due to the use of firearms.</i>

1347
01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:32.208
We consider the degree cannot be confirmed

1348
01:38:32.291 --> 01:38:35.583
because the guns seized in different raids

1349
01:38:35.666 --> 01:38:37.916
do not coincide with the ones used.

1350
01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.333
which are toy guns.

1351
01:38:39.416 --> 01:38:41.791
I think you have to be
pretty naive to believe

1352
01:38:41.875 --> 01:38:42.708
JUDICIAL AUTHORITY

1353
01:38:42.791 --> 01:38:46.708
such a robbery could be
carried out with two toy guns.

1354
01:38:46.791 --> 01:38:49.875
and this is a low-aggression robbery.

1355
01:38:50.875 --> 01:38:55.208
The guns that
the bank was taken with were replicas.

1356
01:38:55.958 --> 01:38:57.833
It was all designed

1357
01:38:57.916 --> 01:39:01.708
so no one would realize.
obviously. they were toy guns.

1358
01:39:02.416 --> 01:39:05.583
Let's say. legally. if the guns can shoot.

1359
01:39:05.666 --> 01:39:10.041
the sentence is greater
than if the guns don't shoot.

1360
01:39:10.125 --> 01:39:13.083
Well. since that was perfectly known.

1361
01:39:13.166 --> 01:39:15.833
we tried to make it very clear

1362
01:39:15.916 --> 01:39:20.291
what type of legal category
this was gonna fall under.

1363
01:39:20.375 --> 01:39:22.041
The guns were real.

1364
01:39:22.708 --> 01:39:25.500
The guns were real. I can guarantee it.

1365
01:39:25.583 --> 01:39:27.458
No one goes in a bank branch.

1366
01:39:27.541 --> 01:39:31.666
knowing there's security.
armed security. alarms.

1367
01:39:31.750 --> 01:39:35.375
The person with the apron
had a Browning 2000.

1368
01:39:37.666 --> 01:39:39.250
I think he

1369
01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.291
can't bring himself

1370
01:39:43.541 --> 01:39:47.000
to admit they got him with a plastic gun.

1371
01:39:47.083 --> 01:39:49.000
That's what…

1372
01:39:50.458 --> 01:39:53.208
They humiliated him.
and he didn't like it. you know?

1373
01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:04.416
San Isidro. May 21. 2010.

1374
01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:08.250
This court. on this day.
aware of the preceding verdict.

1375
01:40:08.333 --> 01:40:13.333
unanimously sentences
Rubén Alberto de la Torre

1376
01:40:13.416 --> 01:40:16.250
to 15 years in prison.

1377
01:40:16.333 --> 01:40:21.500
José Julián Zalloechevarría
to ten years in prison.

1378
01:40:21.583 --> 01:40:27.208
Sebastián García Bolster
to nine years in prison.

1379
01:40:27.291 --> 01:40:31.875
Fernando Araujo to 14 years in prison.

1380
01:40:34.666 --> 01:40:36.541
In the first trial. they'd been sentenced

1381
01:40:36.625 --> 01:40:41.458
for armed robbery. for using guns
that were proven to be capable of firing.

1382
01:40:41.541 --> 01:40:43.750
What the justice system
finally established

1383
01:40:43.833 --> 01:40:45.750
and what they were convicted for

1384
01:40:45.833 --> 01:40:47.958
is that the guns were prop guns.

1385
01:40:48.041 --> 01:40:51.958
which implies
they weren't capable of firing

1386
01:40:52.041 --> 01:40:53.916
or for their specific purpose.

1387
01:40:54.500 --> 01:40:58.750
The only benefit. in a way.
that Vitette Sellanes had

1388
01:40:58.833 --> 01:41:02.166
was that he'd managed
to miss the trial with his partners.

1389
01:41:02.250 --> 01:41:04.541
We made an agreement
for an abbreviated trial.

1390
01:41:04.625 --> 01:41:08.041
The sentences he had before were combined.

1391
01:41:08.125 --> 01:41:10.083
and he ended up with a single sentence

1392
01:41:10.166 --> 01:41:15.666
that also accounted for
all the crimes he'd done around that time.

1393
01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:19.333
They sentenced me to 14 years.

1394
01:41:19.416 --> 01:41:23.583
but in the end.
I spent a year and a half in jail.

1395
01:41:25.416 --> 01:41:30.208
In total. I spent 25 months
in prison or at the police station

1396
01:41:30.291 --> 01:41:32.625
and after that.
I spent two years on house arrest.

1397
01:41:33.750 --> 01:41:36.125
They gave me 20 years.
what the prosecutor asked for.

1398
01:41:36.208 --> 01:41:37.958
The court gave me 15.

1399
01:41:38.041 --> 01:41:40.333
and an appeal got it to 12 and a half.

1400
01:41:40.416 --> 01:41:42.000
But I served eight and a half.

1401
01:41:43.291 --> 01:41:47.125
I got three more years
from a bureaucratic problem

1402
01:41:47.208 --> 01:41:48.708
or a vendetta.

1403
01:41:48.791 --> 01:41:52.833
But the truth is
I'm not one to use foul language.

1404
01:41:52.916 --> 01:41:54.250
I don't give a fuck.

1405
01:42:02.041 --> 01:42:05.041
Well. my life changed drastically.

1406
01:42:05.125 --> 01:42:08.375
Moreover. after my first release.

1407
01:42:08.458 --> 01:42:12.416
I had depression
because I went from being Sebastián.

1408
01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:14.041
the motorcycle mechanic.

1409
01:42:14.125 --> 01:42:17.666
to Sebastián. the bank robber. let's say.

1410
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:19.875
I went from being a normal person

1411
01:42:19.958 --> 01:42:23.791
to. I don't know.
a supervillain. a superhero.

1412
01:42:23.875 --> 01:42:27.208
I don't know because
people stopped me and congratulated me.

1413
01:42:27.291 --> 01:42:29.291
and I didn't take responsibility.
you know?

1414
01:42:29.375 --> 01:42:31.875
I'd say. "No. I don't know
what you're talking about."

1415
01:42:40.958 --> 01:42:42.541
As of today.

1416
01:42:44.208 --> 01:42:48.500
no amount of money
makes up for the time I lost.

1417
01:42:48.583 --> 01:42:53.166
In a year. I do a ton of stuff. and
in a year in jail. I don't do anything.

1418
01:42:53.250 --> 01:42:55.875
So when you discover
all that time you lost.

1419
01:42:55.958 --> 01:42:59.333
banging your head.
wanting revenge. and going back for more.

1420
01:42:59.416 --> 01:43:02.375
you're gonna add up the years.
You lose a whole lifetime this way.

1421
01:43:02.875 --> 01:43:05.208
I think it's not worth it.

1422
01:43:08.708 --> 01:43:12.458
<i>Hi. Good morning. Beto.</i>
<i>Sorry to bother you.</i>

1423
01:43:13.541 --> 01:43:16.375
<i>Do you know a lawyer?</i>

1424
01:43:17.291 --> 01:43:19.958
Yeah. look. I'm here in the studio.

1425
01:43:20.041 --> 01:43:22.333
The robbery was an adventure.
It was a dream.

1426
01:43:22.416 --> 01:43:26.875
It was like winning the world title.
and. well. that's it.

1427
01:43:36.125 --> 01:43:38.041
The man in the gray suit was a hit.

1428
01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:44.041
I started talking about diamond rings.
a bunch of gold chains.

1429
01:43:44.666 --> 01:43:48.625
I don't smoke. but big Cuban cigars.

1430
01:43:50.458 --> 01:43:52.583
Some provocative tweet…

1431
01:43:53.625 --> 01:43:58.833
15.000 followers on Twitter.
and 20. and now 25.

1432
01:43:58.916 --> 01:44:00.291
Two Facebook accounts.

1433
01:44:01.041 --> 01:44:05.541
The character is arrogant.
rebellious. provocative.

1434
01:44:06.500 --> 01:44:08.583
And the character grew.

1435
01:44:08.666 --> 01:44:12.583
Let's see. Pass me a washcloth. please.
Look. Let's do things right.

1436
01:44:12.666 --> 01:44:14.291
You say the character.

1437
01:44:14.833 --> 01:44:18.291
The character takes off his chains.
his gold. his diamonds.

1438
01:44:18.375 --> 01:44:21.166
I remove my dad's little cross.

1439
01:44:21.666 --> 01:44:24.333
which is a symbol I cherish a lot.

1440
01:44:24.416 --> 01:44:27.666
The character leaves
with a makeup remover wipe.

1441
01:44:28.166 --> 01:44:29.875
Done. That's it.

1442
01:44:32.750 --> 01:44:35.791
Marito wears jeans
because they get wrecked

1443
01:44:36.416 --> 01:44:38.541
working with nitric acid
at his jewelry shop.

1444
01:44:38.625 --> 01:44:40.708
And he wears worn-out jeans.
What's the matter?

1445
01:44:44.083 --> 01:44:46.458
I burn my hands. I cut my fingers.

1446
01:44:46.541 --> 01:44:48.875
I get dirt on the polished ones.
but I'm happy.

1447
01:45:12.833 --> 01:45:15.416
There are people who suddenly idolize this

1448
01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:19.375
and they see it as. I don't know.
something out of a show.

1449
01:45:20.208 --> 01:45:24.041
But let's agree it's not charity work.

1450
01:45:24.125 --> 01:45:25.958
It's a robbery. obviously.

1451
01:45:27.833 --> 01:45:29.833
It's not charity work.

1452
01:45:29.916 --> 01:45:33.875
but all the participants in the story won.

1453
01:45:34.708 --> 01:45:39.541
The district attorneys were promoted.
The police officers became commissioners.

1454
01:45:39.625 --> 01:45:41.791
The judges were awarded.

1455
01:45:42.291 --> 01:45:44.833
The victims got back more than they had.

1456
01:45:44.916 --> 01:45:48.000
The game ended with everyone winning.

1457
01:45:55.583 --> 01:45:57.875
Did you think this was my studio?

1458
01:45:59.291 --> 01:46:02.541
We're magicians.
and sometimes. just sometimes.

1459
01:46:02.625 --> 01:46:04.041
we disappear into thin air.

1460
01:46:24.083 --> 01:46:26.666
You're not gonna ask me
where the money is. are you?

1461
01:46:26.750 --> 01:46:28.958
I can't believe you're so childish.

1462
01:46:35.208 --> 01:46:40.666
Saying how much
was actually stolen from Río Bank

1463
01:46:40.750 --> 01:46:42.708
is really hard to speculate.

1464
01:46:47.541 --> 01:46:50.166
How much money did we take?

1465
01:46:50.666 --> 01:46:53.625
Sometimes I start to think about it
and I swear I don't remember.

1466
01:46:53.708 --> 01:46:56.583
Did you know weed causes memory problems?

1467
01:46:56.666 --> 01:46:58.583
I don't remember exactly.

1468
01:47:04.333 --> 01:47:07.958
How much money did you take
from Río Bank in 2006?

1469
01:47:08.041 --> 01:47:10.250
I'll answer that immediately.

1470
01:47:17.583 --> 01:47:21.708
I understand people's fascination.
journalism. Where is it?

1471
01:47:21.791 --> 01:47:24.291
Yeah. in the Cayman Islands in an account.

1472
01:47:24.375 --> 01:47:26.833
Write it down. account number 24…

1473
01:47:26.916 --> 01:47:28.958
No. that's incredible.

1474
01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:35.458
I think people…

1475
01:47:35.958 --> 01:47:39.291
What goes on in their subconscious?
You know why they wanna know how much?

1476
01:47:39.375 --> 01:47:41.708
Because they say. "Well. I'd do the same."

1477
01:47:41.791 --> 01:47:44.541
So. with the formula. they say.
"How much would I do it for?"

1478
01:47:44.625 --> 01:47:46.625
"How much would I go to prison for?"

1479
01:47:47.333 --> 01:47:49.791
But where is it?

1480
01:47:52.333 --> 01:47:53.500
It's great!

1481
01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.500
It's great.

1482
01:47:56.333 --> 01:47:58.958
IN MEMORY OF MY GRANDMA…
