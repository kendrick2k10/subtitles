4
00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:34.117
Okay. so it is 8:30 in the morning.

5
00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:37.454
And. "Why am I awake?" you ask.
[clicks tongue]

6
00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:39.956
Well. it's kind of a long story.

7
00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:46.212
Um. I sort of unexpectedly
started writing the new album.

8
00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:47.964
and. at that point. I was just like.

9
00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:52.802
"Oh. I'm just writing songs
in quarantine." and then they're--

10
00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:55.305
It just became an album really quickly

11
00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:59.726
and really. really kind of beautifully.
surprisingly.

12
00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.187
And. so...

13
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.400
You can't go into studios now
because they're all closed.

14
00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:09.778
and I've never recorded anywhere else.

15
00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:12.447
Um. and I know that other people
do this all the time.

16
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.533
so it's actually not that special.
but I'm freaking out over it.

17
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:19.788
We've built a home studio in my house.

18
00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:25.543
And so. it's. like--
I'm gonna do vocals today in my house.

19
00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:29.422
It's-- I'm very excited about it.

20
00:01:29.964 --> 00:01:31.007
[sighs]

21
00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:35.011
Okay. so over there is where
my recording booth is.

22
00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:38.807
and then on the other side of the wall...
Laura!

23
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.059
-[Sisk chuckles] Hey.
-[Swift] Yeah.

24
00:01:41.142 --> 00:01:42.227
Jack?

25
00:01:43.853 --> 00:01:45.146
Holy shit.

26
00:01:46.398 --> 00:01:49.192
It's like you're right there.
but instead. you're in New York.

27
00:01:50.985 --> 00:01:53.154
I'm freaking out. We've never done this.

28
00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:57.409
This is crazy.

29
00:02:39.034 --> 00:02:41.536
-First day we've been in the same room.
-Cheers. Yeah.

30
00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:42.954
First moment.

31
00:02:43.038 --> 00:02:44.414
That's so weird.

32
00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:47.625
I think when lockdown happened.

33
00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.212
I just found myself completely listless
and purposeless and...

34
00:02:52.047 --> 00:02:54.007
That-- Then that was in
the first three days of it.

35
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.217
And then-- And then I remembered

36
00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:59.512
-when we met a year before.
-[man] Yeah.

37
00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:01.431
And I'd come to The National show.

38
00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:04.851
and afterward you would come up
and talk to me. and you were so nice.

39
00:03:04.934 --> 00:03:07.228
And I was like.
"How do you guys write songs?"

40
00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:11.649
You were like. "We all live in different
places. so sometimes I'll just make tracks

41
00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:14.944
and send them around
and send them to Matt."

42
00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:16.946
And I just kind of thought to myself.

43
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.283
"If there was ever an opportunity
to work with someone I was such a fan of

44
00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:22.327
who could work like that.
that would be so cool."

45
00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:26.122
Then lockdown happened.
and I texted you. and I was like.

46
00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:30.043
"Hey. Would you even wanna work?
Do you-- Are you in that place right now?"

47
00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:32.504
And I was like. "I don't know
if this is a real text.

48
00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:33.880
-I'm not sure."
-[Swift laughs]

49
00:03:33.963 --> 00:03:35.507
Seemed like a bit? Like a friend--

50
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.592
Well. I was like.
"Is someone pretending? No."

51
00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:38.760
I feel like it's also--

52
00:03:38.843 --> 00:03:41.554
One of the reasons why it resonates
with me so much is because

53
00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:46.643
in the dismantling of all our systems
of life that we've known in the pandemic.

54
00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:47.936
you're left with two options.

55
00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.105
You either cling to it
and try to make it work

56
00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:52.941
or to just say. "Well. I guess
I'm just gonna chart a new path."

57
00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:54.859
and kinda get a frontier mentality.

58
00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:58.488
And I think it was such a thrilling use
of quarantine to say like.

59
00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:02.117
"Well. everything's a blur.
so I'm just gonna rewrite it."

60
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.451
Yeah.

61
00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:07.288
I-- I didn't even tell my label
until a week before we put it out

62
00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:09.457
-that it existed.
-What was that call like?

63
00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:11.209
It was amazing.

64
00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:14.045
I thought it was gonna be stressful.

65
00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.464
and I thought I was gonna
have to kind of stand up.

66
00:04:16.548 --> 00:04:19.884
with shaking hands being like.
"I promise I know what I'm doing.

67
00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:21.803
I know that there's not.
like. a big single.

68
00:04:21.886 --> 00:04:25.098
and I'm not doing. like. a big pop thing.
and I'm not--"

69
00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:30.020
But they-- My label was like.
"Whatever you wanna make. we're down."

70
00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:32.022
You ready to play this whole thing?

71
00:04:32.897 --> 00:04:35.442
Yeah. no. I-- I-- I think it's really
important that we play it.

72
00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:39.446
I think it will take that for me
to realize that it's a real album.

73
00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:42.866
-Seems like a big mirage.
-[Antonoff] It does.

74
00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.617
Never worked on an album like this.

75
00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:46.161
Me neither.

76
00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:47.412
Yeah.

77
00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.622
I don't know if I ever will again.

78
00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:53.877
Like. I don't know if it's how albums
are meant to be made.

79
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.378
It just worked right now.

80
00:04:55.879 --> 00:05:00.175
There's something about the complete
and total uncertainty about life

81
00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:02.594
that causes endless anxiety.

82
00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:05.597
but there's another part
that causes sort of a release

83
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.726
-of the pressures that you used to feel.
-[Antonoff] Mm.

84
00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:13.980
Because if we're going
to have to recalibrate everything.

85
00:05:14.064 --> 00:05:16.900
we should start
with what we love the most first.

86
00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:22.280
And I think that was what we were
sort of unconsciously doing with this.

87
00:05:22.364 --> 00:05:24.657
-[Antonoff] Totally. That is it exactly.
-Yeah.

88
00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:27.452
If everything's gonna fall apart.
then make a record.

89
00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:29.996
And I was so glad that we did
because it turned out that.

90
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.124
like. everybody needed a good cry
as well as us.

It was funny because I-- I feel like
you captured the spirit

138
00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:18.641
of the whole record with that song.

139
00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:22.979
With "the 1" in the sense
of just the way it opens. um.

140
00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:26.024
"I'm doing good. I'm on some new shit.
Been saying 'yes' instead of 'no'."

141
00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:30.487
and I was like. "Is she talking about
writing songs with me

142
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.781
and everything else at the same time
or something--"

143
00:09:32.864 --> 00:09:35.742
I think it has a new--
I think it has a double meaning. The--

144
00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:37.869
Opening the album with the words.

145
00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:41.623
"I'm doing good. I'm on some new shit.
Been saying 'yes' instead of 'no'."

146
00:09:41.706 --> 00:09:45.627
Um. it-- it applies to the situation
that the song is written about where.

147
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:50.632
you know. you're updating a former lover
on what your life is like now

148
00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:52.342
and trying to be positive about it.

149
00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:56.763
But it was also where I am creatively.
where it's like. "I'm just saying yes.

150
00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:59.808
I'm just putting out an album
in the worst time you could put one out.

151
00:09:59.891 --> 00:10:03.478
I'm just making stuff with someone
who I've always wanted to make stuff with

152
00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:06.398
as long as I've been
a fan of The National. And--

153
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:08.817
I'm just gonna say 'yes' to stuff."

154
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.318

-That was so fun.
-[Dessner] Yeah.

213
00:14:01.883 --> 00:14:04.177
Oh. God. This is such a blast.

214
00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.847
This is a real. real damn blast.
You know that?

215
00:14:07.931 --> 00:14:11.726
-You know what this is? A real blast.
-[Dessner] Yeah. that was beautiful. Yeah.

216
00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:17.482
When you sent me the track
for "last great american dynasty."

217
00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:21.277
I had been wanting to write a song
about Rebekah Harkness

218
00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:25.115
since 2013. probably.

219
00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:27.242
And I'd never figured out
the right way to do it

220
00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:29.869
because there was never a track
that felt like it could.

221
00:14:29.953 --> 00:14:36.167
kinda hold an entire story
of somebody's life and whatever

222
00:14:36.251 --> 00:14:38.378
-and move between generations.
-Yeah.

223
00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:41.464
Then when I heard that. I was like.
"Oh. my God. I think this is my opening.

224
00:14:41.548 --> 00:14:45.260
I think this is my moment. I think I can
write the Rebekah Harkness story."

225
00:14:45.343 --> 00:14:47.721
That song is such a <i>folklore</i> moment to me

226
00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:50.807
because it's not about you.
but it is all about you.

227
00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.767
-And it's like--
-Well. it's that country music.

228
00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:56.980
kind of. narrative device
where in country music it's like...

229
00:14:57.063 --> 00:15:00.442
♪ <i>This guy did this</i>
<i>Then this woman did this</i> ♪

230
00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:03.111

that I've been talking about."

232
00:15:07.032 --> 00:15:08.992
Yeah. "I was that kid."
Like-- Which is the best.

233
00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:10.493
You listen to country songs.

234
00:15:10.577 --> 00:15:13.204

My whole body.

when you spin it around.

236
00:15:15.582 --> 00:15:17.042
even though
the story's about someone else.

237
00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:18.793
I think it's the most revealing thing.

238
00:15:18.877 --> 00:15:22.005
-I think it's-- it's so deeply personal.
-Aw.

239
00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:24.215

when you hear that at the end.

-Justin Vernon and William Bowery.

284
00:19:20.452 --> 00:19:24.789
Justin is. uh-- is. uh.
one of the greatest ever.

285
00:19:24.873 --> 00:19:27.334
William. I never got to meet.

286
00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:31.379
There's been a lot of discussion
about William Bowery and his identity

287
00:19:31.463 --> 00:19:34.466
'cause... it's not a real person.

288
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:36.051
It's not?

289
00:19:36.134 --> 00:19:37.218

290
00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:40.096

00:19:43.308 --> 00:19:44.684
-[Swift] Who?
-When?

294
00:19:44.768 --> 00:19:48.271
So. William Bowery is Joe. as we know.

295
00:19:49.189 --> 00:19:53.526
And Joe-- Joe plays piano beautifully.
and he's always just playing

296
00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:56.321
and making things up
and kind of creating things.

297
00:19:56.404 --> 00:19:58.448
And "exile" was crazy

298
00:19:58.531 --> 00:20:03.787
'cause Joe had written
that entire piano part. that... [scats]

299
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.122
And it was singing
the Bon Iver part. The...

306
00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:22.639
-[Antonoff] Wow.
-And so. I was entranced

307
00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:26.726
and asked if. um. we could
keep writing that one.

308
00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:29.062
It was pretty obvious
that it should be a duet

309
00:20:29.145 --> 00:20:31.606
'cause he's got such a low voice
and it sounded really good

310
00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:34.442

-Yeah.

really big Bon Iver fans. And. you know.

I was too afraid to suggest it.

00:20:45.495 --> 00:20:48.081
But. I just--
When I sent it to Aaron. I was like.

"This is. uh. hopefully a duet.
We-- I don't know who with.

00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:56.965
Who would it be with?
Who do you think would be good with this?"

317
00:20:57.048 --> 00:20:59.676

"I think Justin would love this."

00:21:04.723 --> 00:21:06.433
No. I couldn't say it with words.

00:21:06.516 --> 00:21:10.020
Because if I would have said it
and he would have gone to Justin.

322
00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:12.814
and Justin would've said no.
it would've hurt too much.

323
00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:13.898
[Antonoff] Interesting.

324
00:21:13.982 --> 00:21:15.608
When we talked about it. I was like.

325
00:21:15.692 --> 00:21:17.777
"I think he's gonna be
really inspired by this."

326
00:21:17.861 --> 00:21:20.572
And then we sent it to him. and he was.

327
00:21:20.655 --> 00:21:25.076
And then the process of working on it
and what he sent back.

328
00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.787
And he wrote--
Like. we didn't ask him to write anything.

329
00:21:27.871 --> 00:21:30.582
-but he wrote this. like--
-Yeah. He wrote this amazing bridge.

330
00:21:30.665 --> 00:21:31.958

333
00:21:36.171 --> 00:21:38.673
I kept thinking.
"This isn't really going to happen.

334
00:21:38.757 --> 00:21:41.968
Like. Justin is going
to change his mind about this

335
00:21:42.052 --> 00:21:45.555
because this isn't a part of my reality.

336
00:21:45.638 --> 00:21:47.807
There's no way
that this is going to happen.

337
00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:49.893
He's gonna record the vocals

338
00:21:49.976 --> 00:21:51.936
and then decide
he doesn't want to be on the record."

339
00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:54.439
And then. it just never--
That just never happened.

340
00:21:54.522 --> 00:21:58.735
Like. he just is on the album.
and he's just the coolest.

341

[both vocalizing]

410
00:26:44.145 --> 00:26:46.815
Where do we start?
I mean. to me the whole thing starts

411
00:26:46.898 --> 00:26:48.608
with "my tears ricochet."

412
00:26:48.692 --> 00:26:51.361
Yeah. Chronologically.
that's the first thing.

413
00:26:51.444 --> 00:26:53.238
I wrote that one alone.

414
00:26:53.321 --> 00:26:57.158
And it's definitely. I think.
one of the saddest songs on the album.

415
00:26:57.242 --> 00:27:01.037
Yeah. I think it's one
of the best songs you've written.

416
00:27:01.121 --> 00:27:02.122
Aw. thanks.

417
00:27:02.205 --> 00:27:05.625
Which is I think why you crowned it
as a track five.

418
00:27:05.709 --> 00:27:10.422
Yeah. picking a track five
is sort of a pressurized decision.

419
00:27:10.505 --> 00:27:12.924
but I knew from day one
this was probably gonna be it.

420
00:27:13.633 --> 00:27:16.636
-Um. it's kind of a song about karma.
-Yeah.

421
00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.055
It's a song about greed.

422
00:27:19.139 --> 00:27:24.436
It's a song about how somebody
could be your best friend

423
00:27:24.519 --> 00:27:28.898
and your companion
and your most trusted person in your life

424
00:27:28.982 --> 00:27:32.027
and then they could go
and become your worst enemy

425
00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:34.988
who knows how to hurt you because
they were once your most trusted person.

426
00:27:35.071 --> 00:27:37.073
-It's the worst betrayal.
-Yeah.

427
00:27:37.157 --> 00:27:39.242
It does remind me
of people going through a divorce

428
00:27:39.325 --> 00:27:43.204
and having that person
that they swore to be with forever

429
00:27:43.288 --> 00:27:47.375
then become the person that they spend
most of their time talking shit about.

430
00:27:47.459 --> 00:27:51.212
Yeah. and it is that ultimate betrayal
when someone.

431
00:27:51.296 --> 00:27:53.256
-you know. messed you up from the inside.
-Mm-hmm.

432
00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:55.675
Writing this song.
it kind of occurred to me

433
00:27:55.759 --> 00:27:58.386
that in all of the superhero stories.

434
00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:04.309
the hero's greatest nemesis is the villain
that used to be his best friend.

435
00:28:04.392 --> 00:28:07.103
-Yeah.
-Um. that sort of thing.

436
00:28:07.187 --> 00:28:09.147
When you think about that. you think about

437
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:13.610
how there's this beautiful moment
in the beginning of a friendship

438
00:28:13.693 --> 00:28:17.781
where these people have no idea
that one day they'll hate each other

439
00:28:17.864 --> 00:28:21.910
and try to really take each other out.

440
00:28:21.993 --> 00:28:24.287
-Yeah.
-I mean. that's really sad and terrible.

441
00:28:24.371 --> 00:28:27.457
But that's the bird's eye view quality
of the song that I think is so unique

442
00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:32.253
because they're both great. but sometimes
you write. like. very in the moment.

443
00:28:32.337 --> 00:28:34.881
And you're like.
"This happened. and this is how I feel."

444
00:28:34.964 --> 00:28:37.133
I love that. but this song.

445
00:28:37.217 --> 00:28:39.469
which is interesting
that it's the first one that happened

446
00:28:39.552 --> 00:28:42.847
because I think it became a huge theme
on the album. is it's very pulled back.

447
00:28:42.931 --> 00:28:46.434
It's very pulled back and commenting
on the whole experience of it.

448
00:28:46.518 --> 00:28:47.560
Um...

449
00:28:48.937 --> 00:28:50.772

[sighs]

495
00:33:24.963 --> 00:33:28.591
In <i>folklore</i>. there are a lot of songs that
reference each other or lyrical parallels.

496
00:33:28.675 --> 00:33:34.097
and one of the ones that I like
is the entire song "this is me trying"

497
00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:36.766
then being referenced again
in "mirrorball."

498
00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:39.352
which is. "I've never been a natural.
All I do is try."

499
00:33:39.436 --> 00:33:42.564
Yeah. I remember that being an interesting
one for you to actually put down.

500
00:33:42.647 --> 00:33:45.191
'Cause I remember you said it.
and you did it. and you were like.

501
00:33:45.275 --> 00:33:48.528
-"Should I say that? Should I--"
-I was like. "Is that too true? Is that--"

502
00:33:48.611 --> 00:33:53.283
And I think with "mirrorball." sometimes
when I'm writing to an instrumental track.

503
00:33:53.366 --> 00:33:56.327
I'll push play.
and I'll immediately see a scene set.

504
00:33:56.411 --> 00:34:00.915
And this was one of those cases
where I just saw. you know.

505
00:34:00.999 --> 00:34:06.212
lonely disco ball.
twinkly lights. neon signs.

506
00:34:06.296 --> 00:34:08.423
people drinking beer by the bar.

507
00:34:08.506 --> 00:34:11.676
um. a couple of stragglers
on the dance floor.

508
00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:17.390
Just sort of a sad. moonlit.
lonely experience

509
00:34:17.474 --> 00:34:20.018
in the middle of a town
that you've never been.

510
00:34:20.101 --> 00:34:22.479
And I just was thinking.

511
00:34:22.562 --> 00:34:25.815
"Okay. so we have mirrorballs
in the middle of a dance floor

512
00:34:25.899 --> 00:34:27.984
because they reflect light.

513
00:34:28.068 --> 00:34:32.822
They are broken a million times.
and that's what makes them so shiny.

514
00:34:32.906 --> 00:34:35.033
We have people like that in society too.

515
00:34:35.116 --> 00:34:38.244
They hang there. and every time
they break. it entertains us."

516
00:34:38.328 --> 00:34:40.163
-Yeah.
-And...

517
00:34:40.246 --> 00:34:45.126
"And when you shine a light on them.
it's this glittering. fantastic thing.

518
00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:48.046
but then a lot of the time
when the spotlight isn't on them

519
00:34:48.129 --> 00:34:53.468
they're still there. up on a pedestal.
but nobody's watching them."

520
00:34:53.551 --> 00:34:55.970
It's a myth we love.
and then we create it for people.

521
00:34:56.054 --> 00:34:57.055
Yeah. It's the whole--

522
00:34:57.138 --> 00:34:58.932
-Like. "Do the broken thing."
-Do the broken thing.

523
00:34:59.015 --> 00:35:01.309
"Make it fun. Now make it sad.
Now make it cool. Now make it sad."

524
00:35:01.393 --> 00:35:03.561
-Yeah. but when the light's off. be okay.
-Yeah.

525
00:35:03.645 --> 00:35:06.356
It was a metaphor for celebrity.
but it's also a metaphor

526
00:35:06.439 --> 00:35:09.734
for so many people
who have to feel. like--

527
00:35:09.818 --> 00:35:13.446
Everybody else feels like
they have to be on for certain people.

528
00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:17.033
For-- You have to be different versions
of yourself for different people.

529
00:35:17.117 --> 00:35:19.577
Different versions at work.
different versions around friends.

530
00:35:19.661 --> 00:35:22.872
different versions of yourself
around different friends.

531
00:35:22.956 --> 00:35:25.041
Different version of yourself
around family.

532
00:35:25.125 --> 00:35:29.129
-Yeah.
-Everybody has to be duplicitous. um...

533
00:35:29.212 --> 00:35:33.091
or feels that they have to.
in some ways. be duplicitous.

534
00:35:33.174 --> 00:35:36.928
And that's part of the human experience.
but it's also exhausting.

535
00:35:37.012 --> 00:35:39.055
And you kind of learn

536
00:35:39.139 --> 00:35:43.893
that every one of us has the ability
to become a shape-shifter.

537
00:35:44.477 --> 00:35:46.062
-Totally.
-But what does that do to us?

538
00:35:46.146 --> 00:35:49.107
And it also is the first time.
and one of the only times.

539
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:54.029
that the time that we're living through
is actually lyrically addressed.

540
00:35:54.112 --> 00:35:58.825
Um. I think that. you know.
the pandemic and lockdown and all that

541
00:35:58.908 --> 00:36:01.453
runs through this album like a thread
because it's an album

542
00:36:01.536 --> 00:36:04.330
that allows you to feel your feelings.
and it's a product of isolation.

543
00:36:04.414 --> 00:36:09.377
It's a product of all this.
you know. rumination on

544
00:36:09.461 --> 00:36:12.464
what we are as humans. blah. blah. blah.

545
00:36:12.547 --> 00:36:14.632
But this is the first time
in the bridge saying.

546
00:36:14.716 --> 00:36:16.926
"They called off the circus.
burned the disco down

547
00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:19.137
when they sent home the horses
and the rodeo clowns."

548
00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:22.390
I wrote this song right after
I found out all my shows were canceled.

549
00:36:22.474 --> 00:36:24.100
And it's like I'm still on that tightrope.

550
00:36:24.184 --> 00:36:27.645
I'm still trying everything to keep you--
to get you laughing at me.

551
00:36:27.729 --> 00:36:33.568
So. it's like. I realize. here I am
writing all this music. still trying.

552
00:36:33.651 --> 00:36:37.072
and I know I have an excuse to sit back
and not do something.

553
00:36:37.155 --> 00:36:38.865
but I'm not. and I can't.

554
00:36:38.948 --> 00:36:41.034
-and I don't know why that is.
-You don't get it.

555
00:36:41.117 --> 00:36:45.622
But that's what makes it. to me.
a great piece of pandemic-time work.

556
00:36:45.705 --> 00:36:47.332
is that it's not about the pandemic.

557
00:36:47.415 --> 00:36:50.293
It's about the experience
of what happens to an artist

558
00:36:50.377 --> 00:36:51.795
when you're living through a pandemic.

559
00:36:51.878 --> 00:36:54.297
-Yeah. You start there-- You start--
-You start to dream.

560
00:36:55.215 --> 00:36:56.257

With "seven." the song.
I was looking back on it.

601
00:40:36.353 --> 00:40:37.896
I've always wondered--

602
00:40:37.979 --> 00:40:41.399
When I see a kid throwing
a massive tantrum in a grocery store.

603
00:40:41.483 --> 00:40:43.818
-part of me is like. "Man. I feel you."
-[Antonoff chuckles]

604
00:40:43.902 --> 00:40:46.738
Like. "When did I stop doing that
when I was upset?"

605
00:40:46.821 --> 00:40:51.576
Like. "When did I stop being so outraged
that I would throw myself on the floor

606
00:40:51.659 --> 00:40:54.704
and throw the cereal at my mom?"

607
00:40:54.788 --> 00:40:57.540
Well. it also doesn't stop.
but where does it go?

608
00:40:57.624 --> 00:40:58.708
-Yeah.
-That feeling.

609
00:40:58.792 --> 00:41:00.752
Like. we're still having that feeling.
but what is it now?

610
00:41:00.835 --> 00:41:03.672
Yeah. so the idea is. you know.
please picture me before I learn civility.

611
00:41:03.755 --> 00:41:07.175
Like. I used to scream anytime I wanted.

612
00:41:07.258 --> 00:41:09.969
Obviously. you know. we can't be
throwing tantrums all the time.

613
00:41:10.053 --> 00:41:12.764
and we learn that
that's not the right thing to do.

614
00:41:12.847 --> 00:41:15.392

Oh wait. here's the bridge.

661

Wait. here's a better bridge.
Okay. now I have the perfect bridge.

667

And so-- But hearing the patchwork
of that whole thing coming together.

668
00:45:10.001 --> 00:45:11.670
I was just like. um...

669
00:45:11.753 --> 00:45:14.339
I just love what you did on that song.

670
00:45:14.422 --> 00:45:16.800
-It takes me away.
-Thanks. I love what you did on that song.

671
00:45:16.883 --> 00:45:19.219
And I've been kinda in my head.
like. calling the girl from "august"

672
00:45:19.302 --> 00:45:22.097
-either Augusta or Augustine.
-Oh. nice.

673
00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:25.100
-I've been naming her that in my head.
-Well. that changes things for me.

674
00:45:25.183 --> 00:45:27.727
Cause she's really nameless to me.
but now it's forever changed.

675
00:45:27.811 --> 00:45:29.813
[chuckles] What happened in my head was.

676
00:45:29.896 --> 00:45:33.483
okay. so "cardigan"
is Betty's perspective from.

677
00:45:33.566 --> 00:45:37.320
like. 20 to 30 years later.
looking back on this love

678
00:45:37.404 --> 00:45:38.822
that was this tumultuous thing.

679
00:45:38.905 --> 00:45:42.117
In my head. I think Betty and James
ended up together.

680
00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:43.201
-Right?
-Interesting.

681
00:45:43.284 --> 00:45:46.246
So. in my head. she ends up with him.
but he really put her through it.

682
00:45:46.329 --> 00:45:49.165
But. like. "august" was obviously about

683
00:45:49.249 --> 00:45:52.585
the girl that James had
this summer with. right?

684
00:45:52.669 --> 00:45:55.672
So she seems like she's a bad girl.
but really. she's not a bad girl.

685
00:45:55.755 --> 00:45:58.800
She's. like. really a sensitive person
who really fell for him.

686
00:45:58.883 --> 00:46:02.470
And she was trying to seem cool
and seem like she didn't care

687
00:46:02.554 --> 00:46:04.514
because that's what girls have to do.

688
00:46:04.597 --> 00:46:07.851
And she was trying to let him think
that she didn't care.

689
00:46:07.934 --> 00:46:10.603
but she really did. and she thought
they had something very real.

690
00:46:11.312 --> 00:46:13.565
And then he goes back to Betty.

691
00:46:13.648 --> 00:46:17.277
So the idea that there's some.
like. some bad. villain girl

692
00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:19.738
in any type of situation who.
like. takes your man

693
00:46:19.821 --> 00:46:24.784
is actually a total myth because
that's not usually the case at all.

694
00:46:24.868 --> 00:46:27.203
Like. everybody has feelings
and wants to be seen and loved.

695
00:46:27.287 --> 00:46:29.622
and just. like. Augustine.
that's all she wanted was love.

696
00:46:29.706 --> 00:46:32.334
That's what I love about "august" is.
like. it's not a dream.

697
00:46:32.417 --> 00:46:35.045
Even though it sort of sounds like it.
Like. it feels--

698
00:46:35.128 --> 00:46:37.088
The situation feels very close to me.

699
00:46:37.172 --> 00:46:38.757
-Like. getting swept up like that.
-Yeah.

700
00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:42.427
That whole song started with the fact
that I had written down in my phone.

701
00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:46.014
"Meet me behind the mall" years ago.

I loved that.

757
00:50:53.678 --> 00:50:57.265
I'd been thinking about addiction.
and I'd been thinking about people who.

758
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:59.225
if they're either suffering
through mental illness

759
00:50:59.309 --> 00:51:03.146
or they're suffering through addiction
or they have an everyday struggle.

760
00:51:04.564 --> 00:51:07.275
No one pats them on the back every day.

761
00:51:07.359 --> 00:51:10.111
but every day
they are actively fighting something.

762
00:51:10.737 --> 00:51:15.450
But there are so many days
that nobody gives them credit for that.

763
00:51:15.533 --> 00:51:16.576
-Yeah.
-And so.

764
00:51:16.659 --> 00:51:20.830
how often must somebody
who's in that sort of internal struggle

765
00:51:20.914 --> 00:51:23.208
must wanna say to everyone in the room.

766
00:51:23.291 --> 00:51:28.963
"You have no idea how close I am
to going back to a dark place."

767
00:51:29.047 --> 00:51:30.298
-or. "You have no idea."
-Yeah.

768
00:51:30.382 --> 00:51:32.967
"You have no idea
how hard it is to get to the point

769
00:51:33.051 --> 00:51:35.637
-where you guys think is still shitty."
-Yes.

770
00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:37.681
Like. I think about that a lot. Like...

771
00:51:37.764 --> 00:51:43.478
The idea of...
the idea of doing your best. or trying.

772
00:51:43.561 --> 00:51:47.399
is one that only a person knows.
and you know when you're doing it.

773
00:51:47.482 --> 00:51:50.151
And it's so hard.
which is what I get from that song.

774
00:51:50.235 --> 00:51:53.613
when you're doing your damn best.
and it's not good enough.

775
00:51:53.697 --> 00:51:55.407
-Yep.
-And it rarely is.

776
00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:56.991
-Yeah.
-Um...

777
00:51:57.784 --> 00:52:00.745
But it's. you know.
it's a very isolating feeling

778
00:52:00.829 --> 00:52:02.330
which. I think. is funny

779
00:52:02.414 --> 00:52:04.541
'cause it actually is
the thing that binds all of us.

780
00:52:04.624 --> 00:52:08.253
Cause we're all doing our best and feeling
like it's not even close to good enough.

781
00:52:08.336 --> 00:52:10.463
Yeah. I had this idea
that the first verse would be

782
00:52:10.547 --> 00:52:14.801
about someone
who is in sort of a life crisis

783
00:52:14.884 --> 00:52:17.095
and has just been trying and failing

784
00:52:17.178 --> 00:52:19.556
and trying and failing
in their relationship.

785
00:52:19.639 --> 00:52:22.225
has been messing things up
with the people they love.

786
00:52:22.308 --> 00:52:24.185
has been letting everyone down.

787
00:52:24.269 --> 00:52:27.814
and kind of has driven to this overlook.
this cliff.

788
00:52:27.897 --> 00:52:32.527
and is just in the car going.
"I could. like...

789
00:52:32.610 --> 00:52:37.115
I could do whatever I want in this moment.
and it could affect everything forever."

790
00:52:37.198 --> 00:52:40.285
But this person backs up
and drives home. and--

791
00:52:40.368 --> 00:52:43.955
Yeah. I love that. The idea that not
driving off the cliff is an act of trying.

792
00:52:44.039 --> 00:52:44.873
Yeah.

793
00:52:44.956 --> 00:52:46.624
Which is almost
the ultimate act of trying.

794
00:52:46.708 --> 00:52:49.127
Yeah. And then
the second verse is about...

795
00:52:50.086 --> 00:52:53.590
um. you know. someone who felt like
they had a lot of potential in their life.

796
00:52:53.673 --> 00:52:57.177
I think there are a lot of mechanisms
for us in our school days.

797
00:52:57.260 --> 00:53:01.181
in high school or college. to excel and
to be patted on the back for something.

798
00:53:01.264 --> 00:53:03.558
And then I think a lot of people
get out of school

799
00:53:03.641 --> 00:53:08.396
and there are less abilities
for them to get gold stars.

800
00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:11.608
And then you have to make all these
decisions and pave your own way.

801
00:53:11.691 --> 00:53:14.778
and there's no set class course
you can take. and there's--

802
00:53:14.861 --> 00:53:18.281
And. I think a lot of people feel
really swept up in that.

803
00:53:18.365 --> 00:53:22.827
And so I was thinking about this person
who is really lost in life

804
00:53:22.911 --> 00:53:28.625
and then starts drinking
and every second is trying not to.

805
00:53:28.708 --> 00:53:29.709

832
00:56:22.173 --> 00:56:26.177
This was the first album
that I've ever let go of that need

833
00:56:26.261 --> 00:56:28.388
to be 100% autobiographical

834
00:56:28.471 --> 00:56:30.932
because I think I felt like
I needed to do that.

835
00:56:31.016 --> 00:56:34.185
and I felt like fans needed to hear.

836
00:56:34.269 --> 00:56:37.439
like. a stripped-from-the-headlines
account of my life.

837
00:56:37.522 --> 00:56:40.734
And actually.
it ended up being a bit confining

838
00:56:40.817 --> 00:56:44.738
because there's so much more
to writing songs

839
00:56:44.821 --> 00:56:48.616
than just what you're feeling
in your singular story line.

840
00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:50.910
And this was the first time
that I ever was like--

841
00:56:50.994 --> 00:56:54.080
I think it was spurred on by the fact
that I was watching movies every day.

842
00:56:54.164 --> 00:56:55.415
I was reading books every day.

843
00:56:55.498 --> 00:56:57.625
I was thinking
about other people every day.

844
00:56:57.709 --> 00:57:03.131
I was kind of outside
of my own personal stuff.

845
00:57:03.214 --> 00:57:05.133
And so I ended up just. like--

846
00:57:05.216 --> 00:57:07.635
I think that's been my favorite thing
about this album.

847
00:57:07.719 --> 00:57:13.099
is that it's allowed to exist
on its own merit without it just being.

848
00:57:13.183 --> 00:57:14.517
"Oh. people are listening to this

849
00:57:14.601 --> 00:57:17.604
because it tells them something
that they could read in a tabloid."

850
00:57:18.438 --> 00:57:19.647
Interesting.

851
00:57:19.731 --> 00:57:23.193
It-- It to me fees like-- it feels like
a completely different experience.

[Swift] So. "invisible string."

889
01:00:18.201 --> 01:00:20.578
When I first heard
the track that you sent me.

890
01:00:20.662 --> 01:00:24.582
I thought. "I have to write something
that matches it."

891
01:00:24.666 --> 01:00:27.961
and pretty quickly
I came upon the idea of fate.

892
01:00:28.044 --> 01:00:30.463
'Cause sometimes I just.
you know. go into a rabbit hole

893
01:00:30.547 --> 01:00:35.593
of thinking of how things happen.
and I kind of love the romantic idea

894
01:00:35.677 --> 01:00:37.345
that every step you're taking.

895
01:00:37.429 --> 01:00:41.808
you're taking one step closer
to where you're supposed to be.

896
01:00:41.891 --> 01:00:45.645
You know. guided by this little.
like. invisible string. [laughs]

897
01:00:45.729 --> 01:00:49.441
I remember when I bought this
little guitar that has a rubber ridge.

898
01:00:49.524 --> 01:00:51.651
which you have one now too.
but it has this like--

899
01:00:51.735 --> 01:00:53.987
Yeah. You got me one and sent it to me.
and it was. like--

900
01:00:54.070 --> 01:00:57.323
I couldn't believe opening up this.
like. beautiful--

901
01:00:57.407 --> 01:00:58.783
Is it a '50s guitar?

902
01:00:58.867 --> 01:01:00.952
-It is from the late '50s...
-Wow.

903
01:01:01.036 --> 01:01:03.121
...and it's been. like.
[stammers] renovated

904
01:01:03.204 --> 01:01:06.207
so that the bridge deadens the strings.
and it sounds really old.

905
01:01:06.291 --> 01:01:09.753
And it just really kind of
writes songs for you. in a way.

906
01:01:09.836 --> 01:01:11.379
-'cause it's so fun to play.
-Mm-hmm.

907
01:01:11.463 --> 01:01:13.631
And that was the first one
that I wrote with it.

908
01:01:13.715 --> 01:01:18.219
and then you wrote this incredible song
that is all about fate.

909
01:01:18.303 --> 01:01:22.515
and that was another moment where
I just felt there was this serendipity...

910
01:01:22.599 --> 01:01:25.185
happening between us and crazy chemistry.

911
01:01:25.268 --> 01:01:29.189
As far as. like--
You took exactly what I had written.

912
01:01:29.272 --> 01:01:32.275
and it was as though we wrote it together
in a room. or something.

913
01:01:32.359 --> 01:01:36.946
I remembered I wrote it
right after I sent an ex a baby gift.

914
01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:39.824
[laughs]
And I was just like. "Man. life is great."

915
01:01:39.908 --> 01:01:44.996
And I just remember thinking this
is a full signifier that life is great.

[Swift] "mad woman."

967
01:05:57.248 --> 01:06:00.335
The first time I heard
that piano thing you had written.

968
01:06:00.418 --> 01:06:04.464
I just felt like-- It's got these
sort of ominous strings underneath it.

969
01:06:04.547 --> 01:06:06.466
And I was like. "Oh. this is female rage."

970
01:06:06.549 --> 01:06:09.010
Like. "This is a song about female rage.
It has to be."

971
01:06:09.094 --> 01:06:11.930
Like. "I have to figure out
how to make this about female rage."

972
01:06:13.098 --> 01:06:15.058
And then I was thinking...

973
01:06:15.684 --> 01:06:18.561
the most rage-provoking element
of being a female

974
01:06:18.645 --> 01:06:21.439
is the gaslighting that happens when.

975
01:06:22.232 --> 01:06:28.571
you know. for centuries we've been
expected to absorb male behavior silently.

976
01:06:28.655 --> 01:06:33.326
Right? Silent absorption
of whatever any guy decides to do.

977
01:06:33.410 --> 01:06:38.415
And. oftentimes when we.
in our enlightened state

978
01:06:38.498 --> 01:06:43.420
and our emboldened state. now.
respond to bad male behavior

979
01:06:43.503 --> 01:06:47.799
or somebody just doing something
that was absolutely out of line.

980
01:06:47.882 --> 01:06:49.259
and we respond.

981
01:06:49.342 --> 01:06:52.095
that response is treated
like the offense itself.

982
01:06:52.178 --> 01:06:53.179
Yeah.

983
01:06:53.263 --> 01:06:55.265
You know. there's been situations with--

984
01:06:55.348 --> 01:06:59.310
recently. with somebody
who's very guilty of this in my life.

985
01:06:59.394 --> 01:07:01.855
and it's a person who makes me feel.

986
01:07:01.938 --> 01:07:05.483
or tries to make me feel.
like I'm the offender

987
01:07:05.567 --> 01:07:08.611
by having any kind of defense
to his offenses.

988
01:07:08.695 --> 01:07:12.741
It's like. "Oh. I have absolutely no right
to respond or I'm crazy.

989
01:07:12.824 --> 01:07:15.410
I have no right to respond or I'm angry.

990
01:07:15.493 --> 01:07:18.288
I have no right to respond
or I'm out of line."

991
01:07:18.371 --> 01:07:21.875
So you were providing the musical bed
for me to make that point

992
01:07:21.958 --> 01:07:24.169
that I've been trying so hard
to figure out.

993
01:07:24.252 --> 01:07:27.589

1038
01:11:17.861 --> 01:11:21.197
I think I really felt like there should be
a string moment on the album

1039
01:11:21.281 --> 01:11:25.493
because we were towards the end of it.
and it was all very piano and acoustic.

1040
01:11:26.119 --> 01:11:28.538
And you're so good
with string arrangements.

1041
01:11:28.621 --> 01:11:32.459
and. you know. Bryce is--
I mean. a genius.

1042
01:11:32.542 --> 01:11:36.671
And I kinda felt like
there should be a moment where

1043
01:11:36.755 --> 01:11:40.216
there's a song
that was unlike anything I'd done before

1044
01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:44.637
and could really exercise that muscle
that I know that you have.

1045
01:11:44.721 --> 01:11:47.766
And I couldn't-- When I heard it.
I remember thinking.

1046
01:11:47.849 --> 01:11:50.560
"Maybe I wanna tell a sports story."
[chuckles]

1047
01:11:50.643 --> 01:11:55.315
'Cause I had just watched
<i>The Last Dance</i>. and I was...

1048
01:11:55.398 --> 01:11:57.567
and I was thinking all in terms of sports

1049
01:11:57.650 --> 01:12:01.237
and winners and underdogs
and things like that. but actually.

1050
01:12:01.321 --> 01:12:05.617
what I had been doing really frequently

1051
01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:09.120
up until that point was I had been doing
a lot of research on my grandfather

1052
01:12:09.204 --> 01:12:12.207
who fought in World War II at Guadalcanal.

1053
01:12:12.290 --> 01:12:16.878
Which was an extremely bloody battle.

1054
01:12:16.961 --> 01:12:20.340
and. you know. he never talked about it.

1055
01:12:20.423 --> 01:12:24.260
Not with his sons. not with his wife.

1056
01:12:24.344 --> 01:12:26.388
Nobody got to hear
about what happened there.

1057
01:12:26.471 --> 01:12:29.057
And so. my dad had to do
a lot of research.

1058
01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:32.310
and he and his brothers
did a lot of digging

1059
01:12:32.394 --> 01:12:36.356
and found out that my granddad was exposed

1060
01:12:36.439 --> 01:12:38.441
-to some of the worst situations...
-Fighting. yeah.

1061
01:12:38.525 --> 01:12:40.652
...you could ever imagine
as a human being.

1062
01:12:40.735 --> 01:12:44.698
And so. I kind of tried to imagine
what would happen

1063
01:12:44.781 --> 01:12:47.450
in order to make you just never
be able to speak about something.

1064
01:12:47.534 --> 01:12:50.954
When I was thinking about that.
I realized that...

1065
01:12:51.037 --> 01:12:55.500
that there are people. right now.
you know.

1066
01:12:55.583 --> 01:13:00.213
taking a twenty-minute break
in between shifts at a hospital.

1067
01:13:00.296 --> 01:13:03.466
who are having this kind
of trauma happen to them right now.

1068
01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:05.844
that they will probably
never want to speak about.

1069
01:13:06.511 --> 01:13:07.512
You know?

1070
01:13:07.595 --> 01:13:09.889
And so. I just kind of thought. like.

1071
01:13:09.973 --> 01:13:14.394
this is an opportunity
to maybe tell that story.

1072
01:13:15.645 --> 01:13:17.897
The way you weave that together.

1073
01:13:17.981 --> 01:13:19.482
where there's remembrance

1074
01:13:19.566 --> 01:13:22.152
and bearing witness
to your family's history.

1075
01:13:22.235 --> 01:13:26.197
but then recognition
of who the heroes are today.

1076
01:13:26.281 --> 01:13:28.158
It's so moving. And I tried--

1077
01:13:28.241 --> 01:13:31.286
The sense of harmony in that song
is really different than other songs.

1078
01:13:31.369 --> 01:13:34.080
And again. it was as though
we did it in the same room

1079
01:13:34.164 --> 01:13:36.041
-and worked out the chords and everything.
-Yeah.

1080
01:13:36.124 --> 01:13:39.586
And how you sing to it
feels different than any other song.

1081
01:13:39.669 --> 01:13:43.381
It was another moment where it just felt
like I was just thankful to be a musician.

1082
01:13:43.465 --> 01:13:45.967
Or like. "This is why I play music."
You know. something like--

1083
01:13:46.051 --> 01:13:47.802
Yeah. I felt that way with this song too.

1084
01:13:47.886 --> 01:13:51.431
where it was just like. "How did this
slot into place and come together?"

1085
01:13:51.514 --> 01:13:53.516
I often feel with this album.

1086
01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:58.063
there have been times in my life where
things have fallen apart so methodically.

1087
01:13:58.146 --> 01:14:01.149
um. and I couldn't control
how things were going wrong.

1088
01:14:01.232 --> 01:14:02.984
and nothing I did stopped it.

1089
01:14:03.068 --> 01:14:05.362
And I felt like I'd just just been
pushed out of a plane

1090
01:14:05.445 --> 01:14:07.822
and was. like.
scratching at the air on the way down.

1091
01:14:07.906 --> 01:14:10.617
and I felt like the universe
is just doing its thing.

1092
01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:15.288
It's just dismantling my life.
and there's nothing I can do.

1093
01:14:15.372 --> 01:14:18.541
And this is a weird situation where ever
since I started making music with you.

1094
01:14:18.625 --> 01:14:24.756
I felt like that was the universe forcing
things to fall into place perfectly.

1095
01:14:24.839 --> 01:14:26.591
-and there was nothing I could do.
-Yeah.

1096
01:14:26.675 --> 01:14:30.387
It's one of those weird things
that makes you think about life a lot.

1097
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:35.392
where this lockdown could've been a time
where I absolutely lost my mind.

1098
01:14:35.475 --> 01:14:40.021
and instead I think this album was
a real floatation device for both of us.

1140
01:18:53.983 --> 01:18:56.486
One of my favorite things
about this record is the fact that

1141
01:18:56.569 --> 01:18:58.363
there's this trilogy of three.

1142
01:18:58.446 --> 01:19:03.910
The trinity of "betty." "august"
and "cardigan" are all. like...

1143
01:19:04.911 --> 01:19:07.831
We made "august" together.
We made "cardigan" together.

1144
01:19:07.914 --> 01:19:10.792
-We all three made "betty" together.
-[Antonoff] It's perfect.

1145
01:19:10.875 --> 01:19:13.545
And "betty" was-- I just heard Joe singing

1146
01:19:13.628 --> 01:19:17.924
the entire fully formed chorus of "betty"
from another room.

1147
01:19:18.008 --> 01:19:19.009
[Antonoff] Yeah.

1148
01:19:19.092 --> 01:19:21.720
And I just was like. "Hello."

1149
01:19:21.803 --> 01:19:23.346
You're like. "I do this professionally."

1150
01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:25.223
-Hello.
-"I'd love to have a conversation."

1151
01:19:25.306 --> 01:19:27.726
It was a step that
we would never have taken

1152
01:19:27.809 --> 01:19:31.146
because why would we have
ever written a song together?

1153
01:19:31.229 --> 01:19:34.149
I thought you were doing a bit when
you were like. "Joe and I wrote a song."

1154
01:19:34.232 --> 01:19:36.276
Then I was like. "What?"
I thought it was gonna be. like.

1155
01:19:36.359 --> 01:19:39.696
you know. people write cute songs
about their animals. in relationships.

1156
01:19:39.779 --> 01:19:41.698
And then you're like.
"No. no. we wrote a real song"

1157
01:19:41.781 --> 01:19:44.159
and I was like. "What?"
Then you sent it to me. I was like...

1158
01:19:44.242 --> 01:19:46.453
So this was the first time
we had a conversation.

1159
01:19:46.536 --> 01:19:48.872
where I came in and I was like. "Hey.

1160
01:19:49.706 --> 01:19:53.209
this could be really weird.
and we could hate this.

1161
01:19:53.293 --> 01:19:58.590
so because we're in quarantine
and there's nothing else going on.

1162
01:19:58.673 --> 01:20:01.551
could we just try to see what it's like
if we write this song together?"

1163
01:20:01.634 --> 01:20:05.430
So. he was singing the chorus of it.
and I thought it sounded really good

1164
01:20:05.513 --> 01:20:08.933
from a man's voice.
from a masculine perspective.

1165
01:20:09.017 --> 01:20:12.020
And I really liked that
it seems to be an apology.

1166
01:20:12.103 --> 01:20:14.981
And I've written so many songs
from a female's perspective

1167
01:20:15.065 --> 01:20:17.692
of wanting a male apology

1168
01:20:17.776 --> 01:20:21.196
that we decided to make it
from a teenage boy's perspective

1169
01:20:21.279 --> 01:20:23.656
apologizing after he loses
the love of his life

1170
01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:25.992
because he's been foolish.

1171
01:20:26.076 --> 01:20:27.160
Allegedly.

1172
01:20:28.078 --> 01:20:29.079
No. he's been foolish.

1173
01:20:29.162 --> 01:20:31.164
No. according to the Internet.
we don't know what it's about.

1174
01:20:31.247 --> 01:20:32.582
-He's been foolish.
-No. I mean--

1175
01:20:32.665 --> 01:20:35.126
We wrote it. I'm confirming.
He's been foolish. He was a fool.

1176
01:20:35.210 --> 01:20:37.170
I don't know who William Bowery is.

01:25:28.712 --> 01:25:33.049
With the song "peace."
uh. when you sent me this instrumental.

1237
01:25:33.133 --> 01:25:35.552
the first word that I thought of

1238
01:25:35.635 --> 01:25:37.554
was this is what peace sounds like.

1239
01:25:37.637 --> 01:25:41.349
It's got this. you know.
this amazing bass line

1240
01:25:41.433 --> 01:25:44.561
that just made me feel like.
"This is serenity. This is peace."

1241
01:25:44.644 --> 01:25:48.606
And then I was thinking.
maybe you just start with the obvious

1242
01:25:48.690 --> 01:25:52.777
and think about how that could be told
in an interesting way

1243
01:25:52.861 --> 01:25:55.697
that kind of goes against the title.

1244
01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:58.491
Like. "I could never give you peace."

1245
01:25:58.575 --> 01:26:02.412
over the most peaceful sounding
instrumental track.

1246
01:26:02.495 --> 01:26:04.622
Yeah. That's why I sent it to you
'cause you kinda said.

1247
01:26:04.706 --> 01:26:08.668
"Send me everything. including
the most off-the-wall idea you have."

1248
01:26:08.752 --> 01:26:13.715
um. and then you were able
to write a song.

1249
01:26:13.798 --> 01:26:17.927
which. not only does it. like.
have such a beautiful--

1250
01:26:18.011 --> 01:26:24.434
It's just such a beautiful love song
in recognition of the kind of. like. uh...

1251
01:26:24.517 --> 01:26:28.605
insecurity in any relationship
that. like. "Will this actually...

1252
01:26:28.688 --> 01:26:31.858
Will I be able to give you peace?
Will you be at rest with me.

1253
01:26:31.941 --> 01:26:35.028
even though. you know. whatever comes?"

1254
01:26:35.111 --> 01:26:37.197
-Yeah.
-Um. but you also trace the bridge.

1255
01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:39.074
When I heard the bridge.

1256
01:26:39.157 --> 01:26:43.161
and that you traced all the weird timing
and weird chord changes.

1257
01:26:43.244 --> 01:26:45.413
it just felt like.
"Okay. we can do anything.

1258
01:26:45.497 --> 01:26:48.124
We might be able to do anything."
or something. You know. this is a--

1259
01:26:48.208 --> 01:26:52.545
Like. it pushed the collaboration forward
at that moment.

1260
01:26:52.629 --> 01:26:56.091
Where I was like. "Okay. so this
is a weird race. Let's just--" [whooshes]

1261
01:26:56.174 --> 01:27:00.136
Yeah. I think this is a song
that's extremely personal to me

1262
01:27:00.220 --> 01:27:04.182
because there are times when I feel like.

1263
01:27:04.265 --> 01:27:06.351
with everything that's in my control.

1264
01:27:06.434 --> 01:27:12.857
I can make myself seem like someone
who doesn't have an abnormal life.

1265
01:27:12.941 --> 01:27:14.567
And I try that every day.

1266
01:27:14.651 --> 01:27:17.070
Every day it's like.
"How do I make myself.

1267
01:27:17.153 --> 01:27:19.781
among my friends and family
and my loved ones.

1268
01:27:19.864 --> 01:27:23.952
not see this big elephant
that's in the room for a normal life?"

1269
01:27:24.035 --> 01:27:26.079
Because I don't want
the elephant in the room.

1270
01:27:26.162 --> 01:27:27.372
-Yeah.
-You know?

1271
01:27:27.455 --> 01:27:30.208
If you're gonna be in my life.
I feel like there's a certain amount

1272
01:27:30.291 --> 01:27:33.003
that comes with it
that I can't stop from happening.

1273
01:27:33.086 --> 01:27:37.090
I can't stop from you getting a call
in the morning that says. you know.

1274
01:27:37.173 --> 01:27:40.135
the tabloids are writing this today.

1275
01:27:40.218 --> 01:27:45.056
I can't help it if there's a guy
with a long lens camera

1276
01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:49.310
two miles away with a telescope lens
taking pictures of you.

1277
01:27:49.394 --> 01:27:51.813
I can't stop those things from happening.

1278
01:27:51.896 --> 01:27:55.859
And so. this song was basically.
like. is it enough?

1279
01:27:55.942 --> 01:28:00.572
Is the stuff that I can control enough

1280
01:28:00.655 --> 01:28:05.160
to sort of block out
the things that I can't?

1281
01:28:05.243 --> 01:28:06.578
-Yeah.
-Um...

1282
01:28:06.661 --> 01:28:10.331
So. it makes me really. like.
really emotional to hear this song

1283
01:28:10.415 --> 01:28:13.460
and to know
that a lot of people related to it

1284
01:28:13.543 --> 01:28:17.130
who aren't talking about the same things
that I'm talking about.

1285
01:28:17.213 --> 01:28:20.383
They're talking about human complexity.

1286
01:28:20.467 --> 01:28:24.346
Yeah. I love that about the record
in general and this song specifically.

1287
01:28:24.429 --> 01:28:26.473
'Cause to me. it's about--

1288
01:28:26.556 --> 01:28:29.726
I have. in my life.
suffered from depression.

1289
01:28:29.809 --> 01:28:32.354
and I'm a hard person
to be in a relationship with

1290
01:28:32.437 --> 01:28:35.440
or be married to because I go up and down.

1291
01:28:35.523 --> 01:28:39.110
And I can't help it. It's a chemical thing
that happens sometimes.

1292
01:28:39.194 --> 01:28:42.280
And music is a way
of dealing with that for me.

1293
01:28:42.364 --> 01:28:48.870
Um. and just somehow the song captures
the fragility of what that's like

1294
01:28:48.953 --> 01:28:52.165
to be in a relationship with someone
who may or may not have peace

1295
01:28:52.248 --> 01:28:54.125
or may--
But that's. again. my interpretation.

1296
01:28:54.209 --> 01:28:56.127
And someone who
you would wanna provide with peace.

1297
01:28:56.211 --> 01:28:57.796
-Yeah.
-You know. someone that you love.

1298
01:28:57.879 --> 01:29:01.508
so you want them to have
as much peace in their life as possible

1299
01:29:01.591 --> 01:29:06.179
and reconciling the fact that you might
not be their best option for that.

1300
01:29:06.262 --> 01:29:08.682
-but is it still a deal they wanna take?
-Yeah.

Okay. the word hoax
is another word that I love

1338
01:32:29.841 --> 01:32:32.844
'cause I love that it has an "x."
and I love the way that it looks.

1339
01:32:32.927 --> 01:32:34.304
and I love the way it sounds.

1340
01:32:34.387 --> 01:32:37.140
I think with this song being
the last song on the album.

1341
01:32:37.223 --> 01:32:42.395
it kind of embodied all the things
that this album was thematically.

1342
01:32:42.479 --> 01:32:47.233
Like confessions. um.
incorporating nature.

1343
01:32:47.317 --> 01:32:50.612
emotional volatility
and ambiguity at the same time.

1344
01:32:50.695 --> 01:32:54.199
sort of love that isn't just easy.

1345
01:32:54.282 --> 01:32:58.620
And it's the most symbolic. poetic thing

1346
01:32:58.703 --> 01:33:02.040
listing all these things
that this person is to you.

1347
01:33:02.123 --> 01:33:04.292
And I remember I asked you
for advice on this one.

1348
01:33:04.376 --> 01:33:06.086
You did. I think you didn't-- I think...

1349
01:33:06.169 --> 01:33:08.338
Like. to you it meant different things.

1350
01:33:08.421 --> 01:33:10.799
and that was a moment
of. like. doubt or something.

1351
01:33:10.882 --> 01:33:12.926
And I said-- I think I said.

1352
01:33:13.009 --> 01:33:17.097
"What if not all of these feelings
are about the same person?

1353
01:33:17.180 --> 01:33:22.102
What if I'm writing about several
different. very fractured situations?"

1354
01:33:22.185 --> 01:33:24.104
Like. one is about love.

1355
01:33:24.187 --> 01:33:28.149
and one is about a business thing
that really hurt.

1356
01:33:28.233 --> 01:33:31.736
and one is about a sort of relationship
that I consider to be family.

1357
01:33:31.820 --> 01:33:33.488
but that really hurt.

1358
01:33:33.571 --> 01:33:34.614
Yeah. and I remember--

1359
01:33:34.698 --> 01:33:36.408
-This is one of the moments--
-You referenced Matt.

1360
01:33:36.491 --> 01:33:39.035
Yeah. When Matt. you know.
The National and Matt Berninger--

1361
01:33:39.119 --> 01:33:44.457
Often songs are about more than one thing
or many sides of a coin.

1362
01:33:44.541 --> 01:33:46.876
And I just love that.
and I kind of thought.

1363
01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:49.796
"This is-- This feels different.
and it also feels--"

1364
01:33:49.879 --> 01:33:53.299
Um. I kinda like the fact
that you weren't totally sure.

1365
01:33:53.383 --> 01:33:54.843
I definitely had the moment of doubt.

1366
01:33:54.926 --> 01:33:56.970
I had the moment of like.
"I don't usually do this.

1367
01:33:57.053 --> 01:33:59.597
I usually know exactly
what I'm writing about."

1368
01:33:59.681 --> 01:34:03.768
Um. and I was really happy when
you kinda pushed me forward like.

1369
01:34:04.477 --> 01:34:06.396
"Nope. do the thing
that makes you uncomfortable."

1370
01:34:06.479 --> 01:34:09.399
Because I think that's what makes it
a song that really. to me. stands out.

1371
01:34:09.482 --> 01:34:12.944
That line about. "you know it still hurts
underneath my scars

1372
01:34:13.028 --> 01:34:15.655
from when they pulled me apart."
Anyone in my life knows

1373
01:34:15.739 --> 01:34:18.867
-what I'm singing about there. but it--
-"But what you did was just as dark."

1374
01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:21.119
Everybody has that situation in their life

1375
01:34:21.202 --> 01:34:23.747
where it's. like. you let someone in
and they get to know you.

1376
01:34:23.830 --> 01:34:26.374
and they know exactly what buttons
to push to hurt you the most.

1377
01:34:26.458 --> 01:34:27.459
Yeah.

1378
01:34:27.542 --> 01:34:30.795
That thing where the scar healed over.
but it's still painful.

1379
01:34:30.879 --> 01:34:32.422
They still have phantom pain.

1380
01:34:32.505 --> 01:34:33.506
Yeah.

1381
01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:36.593
I think the part
that sounds like love to me is.

1382
01:34:36.676 --> 01:34:38.678
"Don't want no other
shade of blue but you.

1383
01:34:38.762 --> 01:34:40.722
No other sadness in the world would do."

1384
01:34:40.805 --> 01:34:43.850
It sounds like-- To me.
that sounds like what love really is.

1385
01:34:43.933 --> 01:34:45.643
Like. "Who would you be sad with?

1386
01:34:45.727 --> 01:34:47.812
And who would you deal with
when they were sad?"

1387
01:34:47.896 --> 01:34:52.067
And like. "Gray skies every day
for months. would you still stay?"

1388
01:34:52.150 --> 01:34:53.109
Yeah.

1389
01:34:53.193 --> 01:34:56.279

01:38:36.124 --> 01:38:40.295
of what I've wanted to escape from

1430
01:38:40.378 --> 01:38:42.839
and where I saw myself escaping.

1431
01:38:42.922 --> 01:38:46.343
Um. we'd gone to the Lake District
in England. uh. a couple years ago.

1432
01:38:46.426 --> 01:38:47.927
What is the Lake District?

1433
01:38:48.011 --> 01:38:51.348
It's in England. and. you know.
in the 19th century.

1434
01:38:51.431 --> 01:38:54.059
you had a lot of poets
like William Wordsworth.

1435
01:38:54.142 --> 01:38:57.228
and John Keats would spend
a lot of time there.

1436
01:38:57.312 --> 01:39:01.566
There was a poet district.
these artists that moved there.

1437
01:39:01.649 --> 01:39:05.028
and they were kind of heckled for it
and made fun of for it

1438
01:39:05.111 --> 01:39:10.867
as being these eccentrics
and these kind of odd. um. odd artists

1439
01:39:10.950 --> 01:39:13.078
who decided that
they just wanted to live there.

1440
01:39:13.161 --> 01:39:16.164
And I remembered when we went. I thought.

1441
01:39:16.247 --> 01:39:19.959
"Man. I could see this.

1442
01:39:20.043 --> 01:39:21.878
You know. you live in a cottage.

1443
01:39:21.961 --> 01:39:24.506
and you've got wisteria growing up
the outside of it.

1444
01:39:24.589 --> 01:39:27.759
and you just-- [stammers]

1445
01:39:27.842 --> 01:39:30.595
Of course they escaped like that.
Of course they would do that."

1446
01:39:30.679 --> 01:39:34.265
And they had their own community of
other artists who had done the same thing.

1447
01:39:34.349 --> 01:39:39.187
And then. I've always. in my career.
since I was probably about 20.

1448
01:39:39.270 --> 01:39:42.857
written about this sort of
cottage backup plan that I have.

1449
01:39:42.941 --> 01:39:45.652
-You've been writing about that forever.
-I've been writing about it forever.

1450
01:39:45.735 --> 01:39:47.696
You've been writing about
getting out forever.

1451
01:39:47.779 --> 01:39:50.657
Yeah. So "the lakes"
is really talking a lot about

1452
01:39:50.740 --> 01:39:52.867
relating to people who.
hundreds of years ago.

1453
01:39:52.951 --> 01:39:56.788
had the same exit plan and did it.
And they went and did it.

1454
01:39:56.871 --> 01:39:59.582
I went to William Wordsworth's grave

1455
01:39:59.666 --> 01:40:03.336
and just sat there. and I was like.
"Wow. you went and did it."

1456
01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:04.796
-Yeah.
-"You just did it.

1457
01:40:04.879 --> 01:40:07.007
You just went away. and you kept writing.

1458
01:40:07.090 --> 01:40:09.801
but you didn't subscribe to the things
that were killing you."

1459
01:40:09.884 --> 01:40:13.847
[stammers] You left those things behind
in a real way.

1460
01:40:13.930 --> 01:40:17.225
And that's really
the overarching thing that I felt

1461
01:40:17.308 --> 01:40:19.144
when I was writing <i>folklore</i> is.

1462
01:40:19.227 --> 01:40:22.647
I may not be able to go
to the Lakes right now.

1463
01:40:22.731 --> 01:40:26.067
or to go anywhere.
but I'm going there in my head.

1464
01:40:26.151 --> 01:40:28.695
-and this escape plan is working.
-Well. you have your version of it.

1465
01:40:28.778 --> 01:40:31.990
That. to me. is the hope
in this body of work is that

1466
01:40:32.073 --> 01:40:34.034
it's not. "I can't do this. I'm out."

1467
01:40:34.117 --> 01:40:37.912
It's. "I've found something
worth escaping with."

1468
01:40:37.996 --> 01:40:39.831
-And a person to escape with.
-And a person.

1469
01:40:39.914 --> 01:40:43.168
And. to me. that's a huge.
sincere statement of hope

1470
01:40:43.251 --> 01:40:47.839
that everything I'm naming
is completely small compared to this love.

1471
01:40:47.922 --> 01:40:49.716
Yeah. it's the perfect--

1472
01:40:49.799 --> 01:40:54.054
I thought it would be the perfect way
to slot the last puzzle piece in.

1473
01:40:54.137 --> 01:40:56.348
right when people least expected it.

1474
01:40:56.431 --> 01:40:57.432
Yeah.

1475
01:40:57.515 --> 01:41:00.977
Um. because "hoax" as the ending song
for the record.

1476
01:41:01.061 --> 01:41:04.230
I thought was interesting
for a couple weeks.

1477
01:41:04.314 --> 01:41:08.610
but then I wanted to actually come in
with the real last song of the record.

1478
01:41:08.693 --> 01:41:13.239
which is this song that-- "the lakes."
which shows you exactly what--

1479
01:41:13.323 --> 01:41:16.242
It kinda is the overarching theme
of the whole album.

1480
01:41:16.326 --> 01:41:20.955
of trying to escape.
having something you wanna protect.

1481
01:41:21.039 --> 01:41:23.500
trying to protect your own sanity.

1482
01:41:23.583 --> 01:41:26.795
and saying. "Look. they did this
hundreds of years ago.

1483
01:41:27.295 --> 01:41:30.048
I'm not the first person
who's felt this way. They did this."

1484
01:41:30.131 --> 01:41:32.550
It's a really potent statement right now.

1485
01:41:32.634 --> 01:41:34.928
I think the idea of getting away
and figuring out

1486
01:41:35.011 --> 01:41:39.140
how to remove the things
that are not working in one's life

1487
01:41:39.224 --> 01:41:41.226
is the story of this time.

1488
01:41:41.309 --> 01:41:43.520
-Yeah.
-If you're not thinking about that.

1489
01:41:43.603 --> 01:41:45.146

[chuckles]

1527
01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:53.043
[Antonoff softly] Beautiful.

1528
01:44:53.543 --> 01:44:54.753
[Swift] Whiskey?

1529
01:44:54.836 --> 01:44:56.796
-[Dessner] This way to the whiskey.
-[Swift laughs]

1530
01:45:11.436 --> 01:45:15.815
So the record was recorded here.
my studio. and your house.

1531
01:45:15.899 --> 01:45:17.192
Yes.

1532
01:45:17.275 --> 01:45:18.943
Did you give it a name?

1533
01:45:19.027 --> 01:45:22.655
Yes. Think it's called
Kitty Committee Studios on the album?

1534
01:45:22.739 --> 01:45:23.740
It works.

1535
01:45:23.823 --> 01:45:27.243
It does. 'cause I've got cats fighting
in the background. on the bed.

1536
01:45:27.327 --> 01:45:28.995
[Antonoff] There was a big cat vibe. yeah.

1537
01:45:29.079 --> 01:45:30.622
And then the cats were the only people--

1538
01:45:30.705 --> 01:45:32.916
-Laura kept getting cats.
-[Swift] The cats were going in and out

1539
01:45:32.999 --> 01:45:34.542
because if I were to close the door
on them.

1540
01:45:34.626 --> 01:45:35.877
-they'd meow.
-[Antonoff] Yeah.

1541
01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:38.213
[Swift] So they need to be able
to be free-range cats.

1542
01:45:38.296 --> 01:45:39.631
-[Antonoff] Yes.
-Yeah. cage-free.

1543
01:45:41.049 --> 01:45:43.468
Guys. Stop it. Stop. Stop!

1544
01:45:45.261 --> 01:45:48.306
Benjamin always starts it.
and Olivia always finishes it.

1545
01:45:48.390 --> 01:45:51.476
He's twice her size.
but she's an amazing fighter. Look at her.

1546
01:45:51.559 --> 01:45:54.479
It's usually Benjamin and Olivia
that have lots of--

1547
01:45:54.562 --> 01:45:56.564
I call them the marshmallow wars.

1548
01:45:56.648 --> 01:45:59.484
No one's gonna get hurt.
but there's a lot of--

1549
01:45:59.567 --> 01:46:01.027
There's a lot of this.

1550
01:46:01.111 --> 01:46:02.112
It was bizarre.

1551
01:46:02.195 --> 01:46:03.488
It really was bizarre.

1552
01:46:03.571 --> 01:46:06.950
but it was. at the same time.
my favorite recording experience.

1553
01:46:07.033 --> 01:46:10.620
Yeah. I mean. it's just a very cool way
to have made an album.

1554
01:46:10.704 --> 01:46:12.163
Yeah. it really is.

1555
01:46:15.667 --> 01:46:18.086

1556
01:46:18.169 --> 01:46:19.295
