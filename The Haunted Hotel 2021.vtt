(mysterious music)

8
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.679
- I will not look at it.

9
00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:18.202
It is nothing but a coathanging on the door.

10
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.133
It's nothing but a coathanging on the door.

11
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.430
I moved all the furniture to my liking.

12
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.613
I made everything safe.

13
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.680
Could draw the bed curtains.

14
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.723
Then I'll not see what's there.

15
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.750
Oh. come on. you're a grown man.

16
00:04:48.748 --> 00:04:51.498

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.700

has provided some rich entertainment.

19
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.503
A worse crowd of...

20
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.830
A worse crowd of hypocrites

21
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:14.890
I have never seen.

22
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.570
I must think about that serialI've promised Mr. Sloane.

23
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.320
(mysterious music)

24
00:05:35.815 --> 00:05:39.482
It is nothing but a coat.hanging on the door.

25
00:05:40.747 --> 00:05:43.439
But still you...

26
00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:44.272
look at me!

27
00:05:45.516 --> 00:05:50.516
(haunting music)(heavy breathing)

28
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.470
There.

29
00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:55.713
Now you cannot hurt me.

30
00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:00.560
I've had them move the bed. you see.

31
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.960
so that I may sleep withmy head pointing north.

32
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.193
So. all will be well.

33
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.737
Ah. I should sleep.

34
00:06:16.737 --> 00:06:19.654
(mysterious music)

35
00:06:40.001 --> 00:06:42.668
(woman screams)

36
00:06:54.931 --> 00:06:57.181
(knocking)

37
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:08.473
- My dear sir.

38
00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:11.693
I implore you. give me refuge.

39
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.473
I have had a shock. sir.

40
00:07:16.128 --> 00:07:17.910
A most terrible shock.

41
00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:19.180
- Who the devil are you?

42
00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.830
- Upon my word. sir. Inever would've dreamt

43
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:21.663
of such a thing.

44
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:26.313
- Please. sit down.

45
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.430
- I had left my watchupon the table downstairs

46
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:38.040
you see. sir. where I hadenjoyed a brandy or two

47
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.190
with another gentleman.

48
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.883
Then upon returning to my room I realized.

49
00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:49.082
With my candle. I set outto retrieve it. which I did.

50
00:07:50.598 --> 00:07:53.265
(ominous music)

51
00:08:07.407 --> 00:08:10.830
But coming back. all those stairs. sir.

52
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:13.813
they were difficult to climb...

53
00:08:13.813 --> 00:08:15.929
endless corridors.

54
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:18.890
I became quite lost.

55
00:08:19.856 --> 00:08:22.523
(ominous music)

56
00:08:33.352 --> 00:08:35.890
I tried many doors.

57
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.289
and at last I thoughtthat I had found my room.

58
00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:41.424
and I went in.

59
00:08:41.424 --> 00:08:44.091
(ominous music)

60
00:08:50.152 --> 00:08:52.485
(muttering)

61
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:04.660
- Well. go on!

62
00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:08.560
- So. I went in. and got undressed.

63
00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.820
got into bed and drew the curtains.

64
00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:11.653
Then...

65
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.080
Imagine. if you will sir.

66
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.188
my fear

67
00:09:18.704 --> 00:09:22.104
when I heard another presence

68
00:09:22.104 --> 00:09:22.937
in the room.

69
00:09:24.342 --> 00:09:26.150
- A presence?

70
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.983
- Yes.

71
00:09:27.931 --> 00:09:30.848
(mysterious music)

72
00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:55.950
- And pray. sir. what action did you take?

73
00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.620
- Well. I had to makemy presence known. sir.

74
00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.030
Do you see?

75
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:02.933
What could I do?

76
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:07.480
Delicacy would not permit me

77
00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.933
to be seen by a lady.

78
00:10:12.449 --> 00:10:14.430
in my nightcap.

79
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:15.263
- A lady?

80
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:17.330
- Yes. sir.

81
00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:18.763
I was in a lady's bedroom.

82
00:10:20.441 --> 00:10:25.441
(whimsical music)(humming)

83
00:10:37.193 --> 00:10:42.193
(ominous music)(creaking boards)

84
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.450
Time was against me. so I shouted out.

85
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:50.110
"Ahem!"

86
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:51.003
Very loudly.

87
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.513
- Pray. sir.

88
00:10:54.513 --> 00:10:55.620
What was the lady's response?

89
00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:57.690
- I regret. a violent one.

90
00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:00.715
She screamed most horribly

91
00:11:00.715 --> 00:11:02.664
and pushed me out of the room.

92
00:11:02.664 --> 00:11:04.873
She threatened me with an umbrella!

93
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.830
I had no candle and needed assistance.

94
00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:13.620
and so you see. I am at your mercy. sir.

95
00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:17.740
(knocking)(tense music)

96
00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:19.790
- Quick. quick. hide!

97
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:22.290
(tense music)

98
00:11:28.555 --> 00:11:29.388
Can I help you?

99
00:11:29.388 --> 00:11:30.221
- Where is he?

100
00:11:30.221 --> 00:11:31.060
Where is the brute?

101
00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:33.520
- With respect. madam.are you referring to me?

102
00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.950
- I trust. sir. that you are a gentleman.

103
00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:37.720
But there is a rogue in our midst.

104
00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.760
A bespectacled rogue. sir.

105
00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.283
who has affronted my modesty.

106
00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:45.540
I am but a helplessfemale. sir. as you see!

107
00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.773
- This is a most shocking tale. madam.

108
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.730
I did think... I thoughtI heard some footsteps

109
00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:53.580
come past my door a few minutes back.

110
00:11:55.982 --> 00:11:58.482
(tense music)

111
00:12:02.745 --> 00:12:04.270
Uh...

112
00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:07.213
Please. take my coat. forthe sake of your modesty.

113
00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.180
- Thank you. sir.

114
00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:10.013
Very well.

115
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.940
I will pursue the rascal.

116
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.583
I will call the Constable.

117
00:12:15.566 --> 00:12:18.108
Is no woman safe?

118
00:12:18.108 --> 00:12:20.608
(tense music)

119
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:29.160
- Sir. it's safe to come out.

120
00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.513
- God bless you. sir.

121
00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:35.323
You have my undying gratitude. mister-

122
00:12:35.323 --> 00:12:36.240
- Dickens.

123
00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.590
Charles M.

124
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:38.610
And you are?

125
00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:40.503
- Pickwick. sir. at your service.

126
00:12:43.964 --> 00:12:44.797
(ominous music)

127
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:48.683
This is a hazardous place. sir.

128
00:12:51.347 --> 00:12:52.892
Sir?

129
00:12:52.892 --> 00:12:55.809
(mysterious music)

130
00:13:02.099 --> 00:13:02.932
- It's...

131
00:13:04.377 --> 00:13:07.630
rather cold in those corridors.please. take my coat.

132
00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:08.820
- I couldn't possibly sir-

133
00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.623
- No. no. no. I insist.

134
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:13.163
- Well then. sir.

135
00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:15.753
Thank you.

136
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:21.230
I bid you goodnight.

137
00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.023
- Goodnight.

138
00:13:29.693 --> 00:13:32.360
(ominous music)

139
00:13:37.665 --> 00:13:38.620
(laughs)

140
00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.850
I do hope Mr. Pickwickdoesn't meet his nemesis

141
00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:42.050
in those dark corridors.

142
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:51.010
Candle.

143
00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:52.960
He should have a candle.

144
00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.027
Mr. Pickwick!

145
00:13:55.429 --> 00:13:56.262
Pickwck?

146
00:13:58.568 --> 00:13:59.651
Mr. Pickwick?

147
00:14:02.065 --> 00:14:02.898
Huh.

148
00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:10.367
This place is like abarn. and as cold as one.

149
00:14:11.407 --> 00:14:14.324
(mysterious music)

150
00:14:35.006 --> 00:14:37.756
(pen scribbling)

151
00:14:43.432 --> 00:14:45.265
"The Pickwick Papers".

152
00:14:56.592 --> 00:15:00.259
It is nothing but a coathanging on the door.

153
00:15:05.197 --> 00:15:08.280
(1940s dancehall music)

154
00:15:39.677 --> 00:15:40.760
- Mr. Gibson.

155
00:15:42.639 --> 00:15:43.556
Mr. Gibson.

156
00:15:45.263 --> 00:15:46.500
Mr. Gibson?

157
00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:47.870
- Good evening. David.

158
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:49.200
- Good evening. Mr. Gibson.

159
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.292
And how are you. sir?

160
00:15:50.292 --> 00:15:51.386
- I'm very well. thank you.

161
00:15:51.386 --> 00:15:52.280
And yourself?

162
00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.612
- I'm fine.

163
00:15:53.612 --> 00:15:55.930
- How old is your little one now?

164
00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:59.020
- Oh. young Sebastian. heturned three last month.

165
00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.100
- Three?

166
00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:01.863
Goodness. doesn't time fly?

167
00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:06.130
- The same as usual. sir?

168
00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:07.063
- The same. David.

169
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:11.400
- No flowers this year?

170
00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:14.253
- Uh. no. no. not this year.

171
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:17.150
- Well. you know we can alwaysarrange something for you.

172
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.090
- Ah. I felt it was getting a bit stale.

173
00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:20.173
a bit of a cliche.

174
00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.193
- Of course.

175
00:16:28.131 --> 00:16:30.130
You're all booked in. room 218.

176
00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:31.220
- Thank you.

177
00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:33.170
Oh. one other thing.

178
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:34.420
How do I look?

179
00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.410
- You look perfectly handsome. Mr. Gibson.

180
00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:38.350
- That's good to know.

181
00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:39.400
That is good to know.

182
00:16:59.972 --> 00:17:00.805
218.

183
00:17:15.145 --> 00:17:16.640
(knocking)

184
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.473
- Come in.

185
00:17:18.632 --> 00:17:22.252
(faint dancehall music)

186
00:17:22.252 --> 00:17:24.920
Tim.- Julie. you look ravishing.

187
00:17:26.904 --> 00:17:28.413
- Thank you.

188
00:17:28.413 --> 00:17:29.290
- I brought you some flowers.

189
00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:30.433
- Oh. beautiful.

190
00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.260
How was your journey?

191
00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.120
- Fine.

192
00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.780
- Did you remember to lock the back door?

193
00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.860
- And I turned off thelight in the hall. and-

194
00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.592
- Happy anniversary.

195
00:17:38.592 --> 00:17:39.592
- Happy anniversary.

196
00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:43.830
- Here. let me take this.

197
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:45.518
You don't need it.

198
00:17:45.518 --> 00:17:46.893
Come on. stand up straight.

199
00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.073
- Cheers.

200
00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.460
- They look after uswell here. don't they?

201
00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:57.606
- As well as we keep coming.

202
00:17:57.606 --> 00:17:59.530
(chuckles)

203
00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:00.523
- Forty years.

204
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:04.290
Not many people are married this long.

205
00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:07.140
When do we get the letter from the Queen?

206
00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.590
- That's for the 60th. dear. Diamond.

207
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:11.270
This is our Ruby.

208
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:13.890
- Oh. so she'll send us the Crown Jewels.

209
00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:15.788
- Maybe a nice bottle of ruby red.

210
00:18:15.788 --> 00:18:17.860
(chuckling)

211
00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:19.043
- Forty years.

212
00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:21.720
Can you believe it?

213
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.040
- I can believe it. I was there.

214
00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.143
- For most of it.

215
00:18:27.837 --> 00:18:29.837
- It was a differentworld forty years ago.

216
00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.000
This room's certainly different.

217
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.903
This new wallpaper. ugh.

218
00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:37.960
There's no accountingfor taste these days.

219
00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:41.390
Or cleanliness.

220
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.390
You know. maybe it hasn'tchanged that much after all.

221
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:46.463
I think they've justpainted over the cracks.

222
00:18:46.463 --> 00:18:47.530
(chuckling)

223
00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:49.290
- Styles change.

224
00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:51.980
Which reminds me. I found something today.

225
00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:53.243
- Show me what you found. Timothy.

226
00:18:59.462 --> 00:19:01.542
Well. I never...

227
00:19:01.542 --> 00:19:02.780
Where did you find this?

228
00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.380
- In the loft.

229
00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:07.030
I had a rummage. when Richardcame to fix the boiler.

230
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.413
- You know. some imagesin my mind are like smoke.

231
00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:15.470
They come to me quickly.

232
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:19.090
but break away before I havea chance to hold onto them.

233
00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:22.870
But this. the day you came home.

234
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:24.820
it's as clear to me now as it was then.

235
00:19:26.068 --> 00:19:27.220
Have you shown the children?

236
00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:28.750
- I showed Daniel. he loved it.

237
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:30.350
- Of course.

238
00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:32.650
He can put it in thatfamily tree he's making.

239
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.470
I think these were someof my favorite days.

240
00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:39.680
Strange how I can have such fond memories

241
00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.810
of such dark times.

242
00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:43.700
- Everything's better in the past.

243
00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.551
- Especially the wallpaper.

244
00:19:45.551 --> 00:19:46.914
- Especially the wallpaper.

245
00:19:46.914 --> 00:19:48.030
(laughing)

246
00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:50.120
- We could always add a splash of paint.

247
00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.440
This wine's a nice shade of red.

248
00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.980
Oh. come on. let's dance.

249
00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.730
- No. no. no. my legs aren't up to it.

250
00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:56.563
- Yes they are!

251
00:19:56.563 --> 00:19:57.396
- I said no!

252
00:19:58.528 --> 00:20:01.183
(knocking)

253
00:20:01.183 --> 00:20:03.933
(melancholic music)

254
00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.420
- Good evening. Mr. Gibson.

255
00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:14.360
- Where's David?

256
00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.050
- David's finished his shift.

257
00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:17.490
- I thought he finished at 9.

258
00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:19.170
- Not these days. no.

259
00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:21.020
I suppose he wants to be with his son.

260
00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:22.150
- [Tim] Oh.

261
00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:23.410
- Dinner for two?

262
00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:25.313
- Yes. right. thank you.

263
00:20:26.297 --> 00:20:27.130
I'll take it.

264
00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:27.963
- Can I help you?

265
00:20:27.963 --> 00:20:29.833
- Nope. that's all. thank you.

266
00:20:29.833 --> 00:20:30.666
- Okay.

267
00:20:36.143 --> 00:20:39.726
(soft piano music)

268
00:20:48.261 --> 00:20:50.370
- There's some new staff this year.

269
00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:51.970
David's not around this evening.

270
00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:54.910
Did you know his son is three now?

271
00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:56.350
- Yes. I heard.

272
00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:57.293
How lovely.

273
00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:02.639
I'm not in a hurry to lookafter a toddler again though.

274
00:21:02.639 --> 00:21:03.472
- [Tim] Oh?

275
00:21:03.472 --> 00:21:05.130
- Well. remember Sophie?

276
00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:06.400
- Not so much.

277
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.730
Too sleep deprived most of the time.

278
00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:09.563
- Exactly.

279
00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:15.223
We didn't do too badly though.

280
00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:17.375
Did we?

281
00:21:17.375 --> 00:21:18.208
- What. with Sophie?

282
00:21:18.208 --> 00:21:20.270
- I mean. they both turnedout okay. didn't they?

283
00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:22.610
So. we can't have done a terrible job.

284
00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:25.450
- Julie. I think we did a marvelous job.

285
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:26.990
Daniel looks after me much better

286
00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:28.803
than I looked after him these days.

287
00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.180
Still your favorite?

288
00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:38.114
- Well remembered.

289
00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:45.763
- Are you okay?

290
00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:49.023
- I'm happy.

291
00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:53.003
I'm happy with everything wedid. everything we've done.

292
00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.120
- Me too. my lovely.

293
00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:56.953
Me too.

294
00:22:07.224 --> 00:22:10.224
Julie. where's all this coming from?

295
00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.473
- I don't think we shouldcome back next year.

296
00:22:18.511 --> 00:22:22.130
I mean. I don't think youshould come back next year.

297
00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:28.803
Tim. forty years. Tim.

298
00:22:29.957 --> 00:22:31.443
- Here's to fifty.

299
00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:37.123
It's been so wonderful.

300
00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:42.393
- Every single year. everysingle minute has been perfect.

301
00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:44.953
But you don't need me anymore.

302
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:47.539
Not silly old me.

303
00:22:47.539 --> 00:22:49.956
(Tim cries)

304
00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:54.840
- I miss you so much.

305
00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.410
I miss you every single day.

306
00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:58.619
- I miss you too. darling.

307
00:22:58.619 --> 00:23:00.419
- Don't take this away.

308
00:23:00.419 --> 00:23:03.863
- I don't want to. butwe both know I have to.

309
00:23:07.009 --> 00:23:07.842
- Yes.

310
00:23:09.673 --> 00:23:11.637
I know.

311
00:23:12.562 --> 00:23:13.500
I know.

312
00:23:15.274 --> 00:23:16.744
- Will you do something for me?

313
00:23:16.744 --> 00:23:18.435
- Anything.

314
00:23:18.435 --> 00:23:19.285
Anything for you.

315
00:23:20.124 --> 00:23:23.207
(dancehall music starts up)

316
00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:00.268
- Thank you for the flowers.

317
00:24:00.268 --> 00:24:01.896
They're beautiful.

318
00:24:01.896 --> 00:24:04.080
- Not as beautiful as you.

319
00:25:07.912 --> 00:25:08.745
(music: 'The Boogie Man Is Here' plays)

320
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:29.682
- Please be careful with my machine.

321
00:25:29.682 --> 00:25:31.970
(horn beeps)

322
00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:32.803
- [Man] Machine?

323
00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:38.188
- Shall we proceed?

324
00:25:48.939 --> 00:25:51.260
- I've been working here twenty years.

325
00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:52.886
I ain't never seen a ghost.

326
00:25:52.886 --> 00:25:54.700
- The Ghost Club have heard many stories

327
00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:57.360
originating from this hotel.

328
00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.900
- Ghost Club?

329
00:25:58.900 --> 00:25:59.883
You got a club?

330
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:02.610
What you doin' here then?

331
00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:04.240
That's where you'll find your ghosts.

332
00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:05.073
- No.

333
00:26:05.073 --> 00:26:07.730
The Ghost Club is not a club for ghosts.

334
00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:09.850
We explore unexplained phenomena

335
00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:11.980
and seek out linksbetween this mortal coil

336
00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:13.860
and the spirit plane.

337
00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:15.551
Dickens was a member.

338
00:26:24.861 --> 00:26:27.778
(mysterious music)

339
00:27:06.681 --> 00:27:07.514
(knocking)

340
00:27:07.514 --> 00:27:08.347
Come in.

341
00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:11.870
- Good day. madam.

342
00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:15.000
- Good day. good day.

343
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.090
- Good day.

344
00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:18.800
- And what can I do for you?

345
00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:19.633
- I'm the manager.

346
00:27:19.633 --> 00:27:21.610
- You have my congratulations.

347
00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:23.110
Is that all?

348
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:24.506
- Yes.

349
00:27:24.506 --> 00:27:25.339
- Hm.

350
00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:28.173
- I mean no.

351
00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:33.260
I understand you'reconducting an investigation.

352
00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:34.354
- Of sorts.

353
00:27:34.354 --> 00:27:36.346
- An investigation into

354
00:27:36.346 --> 00:27:37.536
the paranormal?

355
00:27:37.536 --> 00:27:39.340
- Yes. that is correct.

356
00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:40.173
- Well...

357
00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.550
Do you have to?

358
00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:44.370
- I don't have to do anything.

359
00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:46.400
but I want to. and so I shall.

360
00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.040
May I present to you.

361
00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.240
the creation that will make me famous.

362
00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.570
The Spectre-O-Meter.

363
00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:54.730
- Funny name.

364
00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:57.320
- It measures the harmonicfrequency of the atmosphere

365
00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:00.280
and determines if a spirit lurks among us.

366
00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.630
and then pinpoints thewhereabouts of the spirit

367
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:06.183
and expresses it with thisself perpetuating locus device.

368
00:28:06.183 --> 00:28:07.070
- The what?

369
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:08.370
- This arrow.

370
00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:10.050
Years of studying the spirit world

371
00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:11.210
have left their mark on me.

372
00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:13.460
and the moment I arrived at this hotel.

373
00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:15.980
I could sense a strong spiritual presence.

374
00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:17.240
- You could?

375
00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.073
Oh dear!

376
00:28:19.928 --> 00:28:20.845
- Mister...

377
00:28:22.532 --> 00:28:23.708
- Urlowe.

378
00:28:23.708 --> 00:28:24.747
Willy Urlowe.

379
00:28:24.747 --> 00:28:26.121
- Mr. Urlowe.

380
00:28:26.121 --> 00:28:29.010
What do you know of the phantomsthat inhabit your hotel?

381
00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:30.490
- Oh. I don't know.

382
00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:33.170
- Mr. Urlowe. I can tell when information

383
00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:34.700
is being withheld from me.

384
00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:35.980
especially when the information

385
00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.460
is being withheld very poorly.

386
00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:39.860
- Oh.

387
00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:42.110
Well. I haven't heard anything myself.

388
00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:45.170
but I think some of the guests have.

389
00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:46.850
and then there was...

390
00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:48.182
- Yes?

391
00:28:48.182 --> 00:28:51.040
- There was that incidentwith a predecessor of mine.

392
00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:52.930
But it's something thatthe staff of this hotel

393
00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:54.150
would much rather forget.

394
00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:56.570
which is why we don'tdiscuss what happened

395
00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:57.670
with the guests. you see.

396
00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:00.750
- Mr. Urlowe. I am no ordinary guest.

397
00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:03.203
- Well. no. of course not. forgive me.

398
00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:05.570
- Well?

399
00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:06.403
- Well. what?

400
00:29:06.403 --> 00:29:07.629
- What happened?

401
00:29:07.629 --> 00:29:08.462
- Oh.

402
00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:14.680
He was murdered.

403
00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.617
Most unpleasantly.

404
00:29:16.617 --> 00:29:18.550
by his wife.

405
00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:20.720
Big kitchen knife.

406
00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:21.900
Horrible.

407
00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:24.600
The guests sometimes hearhim crying in the corridors.

408
00:29:25.951 --> 00:29:26.784
(man yells)

409
00:29:26.784 --> 00:29:27.742
Poor chap.

410
00:29:27.742 --> 00:29:29.260
- And the wife?

411
00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:30.093
- Quite mad.

412
00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:35.413
They found her in the bath in room 223.

413
00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:41.640
- Ah. violent death and suicide.

414
00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.920
Possible unfinished business.

415
00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.220
Could be sentient.

416
00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:47.620
Excellent!

417
00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:48.890
This is excellent.

418
00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:51.040
And has the wife's spirit ever been seen?

419
00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.190
- I don't know. and I don't want to know!

420
00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:55.440
Ghosts are bad for business.

421
00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.080
No one wants to stay in a hotel

422
00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.310
where there's ghouls andspectres and what have you.

423
00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:00.410
- Mr. Urlowe.

424
00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:02.350
I have traveled all the way from London

425
00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:03.630
to stay in this hotel.

426
00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:05.780
and for just one reason.

427
00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:07.000
- The charming rooms?

428
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.030
- No. Mr. Urlowe.

429
00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:10.740
The rumors of otherworldly phenomena.

430
00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:12.210
If I'm prepared to stay in this hotel

431
00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:13.520
for that sole reason.

432
00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:16.540
don't you think others willbe tempted to do the same?

433
00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:19.670
- [Willy] Well. whenyou put it that way...

434
00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:22.547
- Now. I'm determinedto try my machine here.

435
00:30:22.547 --> 00:30:24.383
and I invite you to join me.

436
00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:26.770
- [Willy] I don't think-

437
00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:27.900
- Courage. Mr. Urlowe.

438
00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:29.680
The spirits cannot harm you.

439
00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.500
Aren't you curious about your hotel

440
00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.910
and the mysteries here within?

441
00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:35.170
- Very well.

442
00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:36.210
You're going to do it anyway.

443
00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:37.623
and I suppose I'd rather be here

444
00:30:37.623 --> 00:30:39.261
when you switch it on.

445
00:30:39.261 --> 00:30:40.261
- Very good.

446
00:30:45.307 --> 00:30:46.473
Let us begin!

447
00:30:51.023 --> 00:30:54.128
(machine whirring)

448
00:30:54.128 --> 00:30:57.378
(electricity sparking)

449
00:31:03.236 --> 00:31:04.452
Look!

450
00:31:06.052 --> 00:31:07.902
(dramatic music)

451
00:31:28.716 --> 00:31:29.974
(machine stops)

452
00:31:32.677 --> 00:31:34.673
(knocking)

453
00:31:34.673 --> 00:31:35.731
- Oh. no!

454
00:31:41.347 --> 00:31:43.620
(knocking)

455
00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:45.230
- Spirit!

456
00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:46.910
Reveal yourself!

457
00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:48.673
I am your friend!

458
00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:55.173
- Spirit?

459
00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:57.980
It's only me.

460
00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:58.813
- Blast!

461
00:31:58.813 --> 00:31:59.646
You didn't see a phantom

462
00:31:59.646 --> 00:32:01.560
on the other side of that door. did you?

463
00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:04.950
- No.

464
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:06.383
Can't say that I did.

465
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:08.263
- Curses!

466
00:32:08.263 --> 00:32:09.820
Failed again.

467
00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:11.420
Blast this machine!

468
00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:14.870
- I came to see whatall the noise was about.

469
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:16.913
The lights was flickering downstairs.

470
00:32:18.664 --> 00:32:20.501
I heard you talking to someone.

471
00:32:20.501 --> 00:32:22.929
- Yes. to Mr. Urlowe.

472
00:32:22.929 --> 00:32:24.570
- Mr. Urlowe?

473
00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:26.480
- Yes. Urlowe. the manager.

474
00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.100
He's in the wardrobe.

475
00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:29.860
He joined me in my experiment.

476
00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:32.070
My failed experiment.

477
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:34.113
Mr. Urlowe. you can come out now.

478
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:37.740
- Mr. Urlowe's dead.

479
00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:38.889
- What?

480
00:32:38.889 --> 00:32:40.943
No. he's in the wardrobe. I tell you.

481
00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:45.213
See?

482
00:32:46.195 --> 00:32:47.623
- He can't be.

483
00:32:47.623 --> 00:32:51.341
(fearful whimpering)

484
00:32:51.341 --> 00:32:52.258
Mr. Urlowe?

485
00:32:54.586 --> 00:32:57.890
- This is the managerof the hotel. is it not?

486
00:32:57.890 --> 00:32:58.893
- I'm the manager.

487
00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.260
- Calm down. Mr. Urlowe.

488
00:33:05.327 --> 00:33:08.027
- He was murdered.

489
00:33:08.027 --> 00:33:10.493
That's what happened to him

490
00:33:10.493 --> 00:33:12.581
In this hotel.

491
00:33:12.581 --> 00:33:17.581
(frantic shrieking)(dramatic music)

492
00:33:20.447 --> 00:33:21.280
(lightning and thunder)

493
00:33:32.268 --> 00:33:35.101
(thunder rumbles)

494
00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:39.300
- [Man] The killerstepped from the shadows.

495
00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:42.650
Laura knew with cold certainty

496
00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:46.133
that she would not liveto see the morning.

497
00:33:47.265 --> 00:33:52.265
(thunder rumbles)

498
00:34:02.313 --> 00:34:03.563
- Good evening.

499
00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:05.523
- Evening.

500
00:34:10.054 --> 00:34:12.060
- I'd like a room. please.

501
00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:13.130
- Yes.

502
00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:13.963
Yes. of course.

503
00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:17.590
How long are you staying with us. mister-

504
00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:18.780
- Fearless.

505
00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:20.270
Peter Fearless.

506
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:21.103
- Mr. Fearless.

507
00:34:21.103 --> 00:34:22.112
- A couple of nights.

508
00:34:27.219 --> 00:34:29.235
- Room 17 is...

509
00:34:29.235 --> 00:34:30.643
well. it's really very comfortable.

510
00:34:30.643 --> 00:34:32.766
- Is it a quiet room?

511
00:34:32.766 --> 00:34:34.824
I need a quiet room.

512
00:34:34.824 --> 00:34:36.420
- All our rooms are quiet.

513
00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:37.820
- Well. that's good to hear.

514
00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:42.547
- Do you need a hand with your-

515
00:34:42.547 --> 00:34:43.679
- Just the key.

516
00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:47.120
Good evening.

517
00:34:48.333 --> 00:34:51.251
(mysterious music)

518
00:35:02.245 --> 00:35:03.203
- You are not going to believe

519
00:35:03.203 --> 00:35:04.540
who's just walked in.

520
00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:08.015
Yeah. I heard he hadsome sort of breakdown.

521
00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:12.683
I... guess he's alright now.

522
00:35:15.913 --> 00:35:18.913
(typewriter typing)

523
00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:51.650
- Malcolm. it's Peter.

524
00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:54.920
- [Malcolm] Peter. where the hell are you?

525
00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.020
- Suffolk.

526
00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:57.520
Ipswich. would you believe?

527
00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:58.800
- [Malcolm] Ipswich?

528
00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.690
Are you alright?

529
00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:00.540
- Yeah. I'm fine.

530
00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:03.675
Bloody great in fact. Malc.

531
00:36:03.675 --> 00:36:04.592
Look. Malc.

532
00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.093
I've started the new book.

533
00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:11.360
- [Malcolm] Wow. Peter. that's fantastic.

534
00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:14.380
- I thought I'd stick witha traditional ghost story

535
00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:16.610
rather than guts and gore this time.

536
00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:20.664
Suffolk has lots of ghosts and legends.

537
00:36:20.664 --> 00:36:22.364
I might borrow a few for the book.

538
00:36:23.353 --> 00:36:24.657
- [Malcolm] As long as you're okay.

539
00:36:24.657 --> 00:36:27.217
Are you taking your...

540
00:36:27.217 --> 00:36:28.660
You know. the-

541
00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:30.200
- Yes.

542
00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:31.033
I'm taking them.

543
00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.730
I'm not stupid.

544
00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:35.130
I just need some peace and quiet

545
00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:37.544
to get on with my work. you know?

546
00:36:37.544 --> 00:36:39.842
Make us both rich.

547
00:37:03.759 --> 00:37:06.259
(tense music)

548
00:37:20.625 --> 00:37:21.458
(low growling)

549
00:37:31.814 --> 00:37:34.564
(monster growls)

550
00:37:53.538 --> 00:37:55.871
(dog barks)

551
00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:03.730
You told me all the rooms were quiet.

552
00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:04.563
- Mr. Fearless.

553
00:38:04.563 --> 00:38:05.790
- The dog in the next door room

554
00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:07.548
is making it impossible for me to work.

555
00:38:07.548 --> 00:38:08.648
- We don't allow dogs in here.

556
00:38:08.648 --> 00:38:10.063
- That's plainly not the case.

557
00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:14.270
(tense music)

558
00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:19.420
Well. your pipes must be very rusty.

559
00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:21.263
- My pipes are just fine. thank you.

560

I used to live up to my name.

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:16.660
Now I'm afraid of everything.

591
00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:23.283

You've got to prove the doubters wrong.

620
00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:07.960

701
00:51:31.143 --> 00:51:32.584

702
00:51:32.584 --> 00:51:34.142

00:51:35.016 --> 00:51:37.766
(sirens blaring)

704
00:51:39.584 --> 00:51:42.501
(aircraft engines)

705
00:51:43.565 --> 00:51:46.482
(light flickering)

706
00:51:52.355 --> 00:51:53.188

It was so strange.

712
00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:14.800
The light was flickering.

713
00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:17.400
and then the room was filled with ash.

714
00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:19.400
just drifting through the air like snow.

715
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:24.000
And then I woke up. and you were here.

716
00:52:26.315 --> 00:52:27.455
- It was dead quiet down there.

717
00:52:27.455 --> 00:52:29.308
except for the wireless.

718
00:52:29.308 --> 00:52:30.530
But when I came back up.

719
00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:33.570
the landlady was waitingin that long passage.

720
00:52:33.570 --> 00:52:36.120
Said she could make us cocoa if we'd like.

721
00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:37.210
I said maybe later.

722
00:52:37.210 --> 00:52:38.390
- Oh. I could do with that cocoa.

723
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:39.603
it's freezing in here.

724
00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:41.670
- It'll be warm under the covers.

725
00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:45.600
- Oh. no. Eddie I can't.not now. I'm scared.

726
00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.080
- You're safe with me.

727
00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:49.630
- No. there's somethingodd in this place. I can't.

728
00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:52.400
- I paid for it all.

00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:54.673
Most of my wages.

730
00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:59.703
I love you. Betsy.

731
00:53:01.295 --> 00:53:03.236
I want you to be all mine.

732
00:53:03.236 --> 00:53:05.892
- Eddie. I said no.

733
00:53:05.892 --> 00:53:08.142
(knocking)

734
00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:13.950
- Everything all right. Mrs. Jones?

735
00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:16.413
- No.

736
00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:20.280
I need to go home.

737
00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:31.397
(door shuts)

738
00:53:40.207 --> 00:53:41.763
- My bloody wages.

739
00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:48.873

740
00:53:48.873 --> 00:53:50.680
(lights flickering)

741
00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:52.305
I paid good money for this room!

742
00:53:52.305 --> 00:53:54.685
(banging)

743
00:53:54.685 --> 00:53:55.602
Let me out!

744
00:53:57.135 --> 00:53:58.052
Let me out!

745
00:53:59.416 --> 00:54:02.166
(falling rubble)

746
00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:08.260
- Just hang on a minute for me. Fred.

747
00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:09.450
We've got time before the bus.

748
00:54:09.450 --> 00:54:10.353
- All right. love.

749
00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:12.930
- Hello there.

750
00:54:12.930 --> 00:54:13.910
- How can I help you. madam?

751
00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:16.003
- I wondered if your wife was around.

752
00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:19.490
- What's this regarding?

753
00:54:19.490 --> 00:54:21.304
- She did me a favor thelast time I was here.

754
00:54:21.304 --> 00:54:22.654
I just wanted to thank her.

755
00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:25.850
- You must've been a little girl.

756
00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:30.083
My wife passed away during the war.

757
00:54:31.650 --> 00:54:34.223
- Oh dear. I'm so sorry.I must've made a mistake.

758
00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:36.943
- It was back in '43.

759
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:41.030
Most of the Germanbombing was over the docks

760
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:43.213
or on Ransomes. the munitions factory.

761
00:54:45.210 --> 00:54:47.910
I was a warden on duty. butI didn't like leaving her.

762
00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:51.027
Not in her condition.

763
00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:58.130
She promised me she'd be able to get

764
00:54:58.130 --> 00:54:59.938
down to the cellar if it got bad. but...

765
00:55:02.248 --> 00:55:04.206
in the end. she didn't have time.

766
00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:08.440
Bomb hit the east wing of the hotel.

767
00:55:11.410 --> 00:55:12.353
Brought it all down.

768
00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:18.407
Seven dead. including my Daphne.

769
00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:25.610
- I was so sure it was this hotel.

770
00:55:25.610 --> 00:55:28.680
Room 27 B.

771
00:55:29.773 --> 00:55:31.773
- The B rooms were all in the east wing.

772
00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:34.470
Bomb took 'em all down.

773
00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:37.133
- Right.

774
00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:41.180
Come on. Fred.

775
00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:42.847
Let's catch our bus.

776
00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:36.368
- As of now. you are arepresentative of this hotel.

777
00:56:36.368 --> 00:56:38.803
and you must alwayspresent yourself smartly.

778
00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:40.623
This is for you.

779
00:56:42.450 --> 00:56:44.300
- Uh. actually it's Maisy.

780
00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:47.033
- [Woman] Any furtherquestions. direct them to Tom.

781
00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:50.890
- Is she always like that?

782
00:56:50.890 --> 00:56:52.230
- Always.

783
00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:54.120
Don't worry. it's easyto win her approval.

784
00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:56.440
Just think Victorian servant.

785
00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:59.280
- Be seen and not heard. don'thave any ideas of my own.

786
00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:00.780
Anything else?

787
00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:01.730
- Try not to smile?

788
00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:05.890
- [Woman] Come along. theserooms won't clean themselves.

789
00:57:05.890 --> 00:57:06.937
- We better go.

790
00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:10.113
- Daisy.

791
00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:14.180
- All the rooms on thisfloor need to be spotless

792
00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:16.110
by one o'clock.

793
00:57:16.110 --> 00:57:18.900
Remember. the devil's in...

794
00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:24.433
the detail.

795
00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:28.683
I have high hopes for you. Daisy.

796
00:57:29.808 --> 00:57:30.641
- Maisy!

797
00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:33.493
- Alright.

798
00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:35.640
I'll start at the other end.

799
00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:37.023
and we'll meet in the middle.

800
00:57:38.345 --> 00:57:40.070
The last one to finishbuys the first drinks?

801
00:57:40.070 --> 00:57:41.640
- Alright.

802
00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:43.215
- See you later then.

803
00:57:43.215 --> 00:57:44.048
Daisy.

804
00:57:48.697 --> 00:57:53.697
(mysterious music)(keys jingling)

805
00:58:12.781 --> 00:58:13.683
- Seriously?

806
00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:20.628
You've got to be kidding me.

807
00:58:41.041 --> 00:58:44.116
(mysterious music)

808
00:58:49.607 --> 00:58:50.440
(vacuum running)

809
00:59:40.979 --> 00:59:41.812
Hm?

810
00:59:48.133 --> 00:59:50.633
(door creaks)

811
00:59:55.676 --> 00:59:56.653
- Wow. that is a mess.

812
00:59:56.653 --> 00:59:58.388
- I just cleaned this room.

813
00:59:58.388 --> 00:59:59.221
- You didn't do a very good job.

814
00:59:59.221 --> 01:00:02.863
- No. I mean I've alreadycleaned this room.

815
01:00:02.863 --> 01:00:04.530
- Okay...

816
01:00:04.530 --> 01:00:06.338
well. I need more polish.

817
01:00:08.919 --> 01:00:11.836
(mysterious music)

818
01:00:13.086 --> 01:00:15.836
(vacuum running)

819
01:00:34.329 --> 01:00:39.329
(scrubbing)(bottle spraying)

820
01:00:54.135 --> 01:00:54.968
- Ugh!

821
01:00:56.992 --> 01:00:58.640
(bell rings)

822
01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:00.550
- Staff never ring the bell. Daisy.

823
01:01:00.550 --> 01:01:01.400
- There's a problem.

824
01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:02.233
- A problem?

825
01:01:02.233 --> 01:01:04.130
- Yes. the room. room 116.

826
01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:05.167
I've tried to clean it.

827
01:01:05.167 --> 01:01:07.410
but it refuses to stay clean.

828
01:01:07.410 --> 01:01:11.040
- Look. there are two types ofpeople in this world. Daisy.

829
01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:13.180
Those to whom the world happens.

830
01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:15.820
and those who happen to the world.

831
01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:17.400
You're gonna go back to that room

832
01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:19.640
and show it who's boss.

833
01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:20.612
Conquer it.

834
01:01:20.612 --> 01:01:21.788
(phone rings)

835
01:01:21.788 --> 01:01:23.300
- Please. can I just show you?

836
01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:25.277
- Time's slipping away. Daisy.

837
01:01:32.371 --> 01:01:37.371
(mysterious music)(clock ticking)

838
01:01:53.224 --> 01:01:55.807
(Maisy breathes in)

839
01:02:37.992 --> 01:02:40.288
(ominous music)

840
01:02:40.288 --> 01:02:42.526
(door closes)

841
01:02:42.526 --> 01:02:45.622
(Maisy groans)

842
01:02:45.622 --> 01:02:48.105
(whispered voices and dischordant music)

843
01:03:05.833 --> 01:03:08.454
(bath running)

844
01:03:08.454 --> 01:03:09.287
(thud)

845
01:03:18.650 --> 01:03:20.120
- Tom. have you seen Daisy?

846
01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:20.953
- No.

847
01:03:20.953 --> 01:03:22.920
- Can you give her a hand to finish by 1?

848
01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:24.140
- So my reward for finishing early

849
01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:25.290
is to do more work?

850
01:03:25.290 --> 01:03:27.260
- Practice makes perfect.

851
01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:30.070
Oh. and don't get too distracted.

852
01:03:33.868 --> 01:03:36.451
(bath running)

853
01:03:39.938 --> 01:03:41.640
(knocking)

854
01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:42.473
- Maisy.

855
01:03:53.508 --> 01:03:54.341
Maisy?

856
01:03:59.341 --> 01:04:01.924
(bath running)

857
01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:31.483
Come on!

858
01:04:39.779 --> 01:04:40.612
Hey!

859
01:04:42.003 --> 01:04:43.128
Are you okay?

860
01:04:43.128 --> 01:04:44.461
- It's the room!

861
01:04:56.672 --> 01:04:57.505
(mysterious music)

862
01:05:01.674 --> 01:05:04.257
(bath starts running)

863
01:05:11.151 --> 01:05:13.568
(door slams)

864
01:05:17.833 --> 01:05:20.403
- I do hope you have a pleasant stay.

865
01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:23.810
and if there's anything wecan do. anything at all.

866
01:05:23.810 --> 01:05:25.049
just ask.

867
01:05:25.049 --> 01:05:26.539
- Thank you.

868
01:05:26.539 --> 01:05:29.622
(jaunty music)

869
01:05:43.450 --> 01:05:45.950
(door creaks)

870
01:05:57.496 --> 01:06:00.360
- What are you doing in my room?

871
01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:04.850
- I'm checking for...

872
01:06:04.850 --> 01:06:05.900
Mice.- Mice?!

873
01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:07.100
- No! Not mice.

874
01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:08.866
Um...

875
01:06:08.866 --> 01:06:09.699
rabbits.

876
01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:12.070
- Rabbits.

877
01:06:12.070 --> 01:06:13.680
- Yeah.

878
01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:15.730
Yeah. they can be a really big problem.

879
01:06:15.730 --> 01:06:19.673
Always chewing things.they've got really big teeth.

880
01:06:21.921 --> 01:06:23.000
(knocking)

881
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:23.833
Hello?

882
01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:26.613
Any rabbits in there?

883
01:06:30.487 --> 01:06:33.404
(mysterious music)

884
01:06:41.348 --> 01:06:43.270
- I don't know what to do with you. Bob!

885
01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:44.680
Head office has been on to me.

886
01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:46.696
and they're suggesting I let you go.

887
01:06:46.696 --> 01:06:50.605
But I've said no. no.Bob. he's a nice boy.

888
01:06:50.605 --> 01:06:53.000
he's a nice boy.

889
01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.240
- Thank you. Mrs. Jones.

890
01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:55.073
- [Mrs. Jones] But I'm not sure

891
01:06:55.073 --> 01:06:56.649
you've got what it takes. Bob.

892
01:06:56.649 --> 01:06:57.482
- Well. I do. it's-

893
01:06:57.482 --> 01:07:00.126
- I think you're more of a lost soul.

894
01:07:01.570 --> 01:07:04.373
- I spent years just drifting around.

895
01:07:05.322 --> 01:07:06.870
I don't want to go back there.

896
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:08.610
I need a purpose.

897
01:07:08.610 --> 01:07:09.930
I need this. Mrs. Jones.

898
01:07:09.930 --> 01:07:12.523
- Then you'd betterback your ideas up. Bob.

899
01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:14.280
Come up with a plan.

900
01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:16.653
This is your last chance.then it's curtains.

901
01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:20.780
- Thank you. Mrs. Jones.

902
01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:22.573
You won't regret it.

903
01:07:28.513 --> 01:07:29.346
- Get out.

904
01:07:32.428 --> 01:07:33.261
Out!

905
01:07:40.197 --> 01:07:41.443
- You can do this. Bob.

906
01:07:42.868 --> 01:07:44.743
You're not a nice boy.

907
01:07:45.621 --> 01:07:46.454
You're a...

908
01:07:48.059 --> 01:07:50.101
You're a tiger. grr.

909
01:07:50.101 --> 01:07:50.934
grr!

910
01:07:52.205 --> 01:07:53.038
Grr!

911
01:07:55.106 --> 01:07:55.939
Grr!

912
01:07:59.127 --> 01:07:59.960
GRR!

913
01:08:02.193 --> 01:08:04.526
(cat meows)

914
01:08:08.231 --> 01:08:10.448
(Bob yells)

915
01:08:10.448 --> 01:08:12.781
(screaming)

916
01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:17.430
- In my office. now!

917
01:08:21.171 --> 01:08:23.569
- You said I should buck my ideas up.

918
01:08:23.569 --> 01:08:25.462
- What were you thinking. Bob?

919
01:08:25.462 --> 01:08:29.110
That poor family were traumatized!

920
01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:31.916
I wouldn't be surprised if they sue us!

921
01:08:31.916 --> 01:08:35.290
Oh. head office is gonnawant my head on a block.

922
01:08:35.290 --> 01:08:37.943
And to be honest. I'd rather it be yours!

923
01:08:41.610 --> 01:08:42.981
Oh. Bob!

924
01:08:42.981 --> 01:08:46.827
Can't you hide behind the curtains?

925
01:08:46.827 --> 01:08:48.895
Woo hoo!

926
01:08:48.895 --> 01:08:51.736
Move a bit of furniture. or...

927
01:08:51.736 --> 01:08:56.049
tiptoe round their bedrooms in the night.

928
01:08:56.049 --> 01:08:57.883
Or waft up and down the stairs.

929
01:08:58.899 --> 01:09:01.729
Punters love that kind of thing.

930
01:09:01.729 --> 01:09:04.942
Instead they get some blithering idiot

931
01:09:04.942 --> 01:09:07.414
wanting to chop up their children!

932
01:09:07.414 --> 01:09:09.271
- I don't know.

933
01:09:09.271 --> 01:09:12.438
I guess I'm just not very. you know...

934
01:09:13.511 --> 01:09:15.158
Ghostly.

935
01:09:15.158 --> 01:09:17.077
- You must be able to do something. Bob.

936
01:09:17.077 --> 01:09:17.910
- No.

937
01:09:19.055 --> 01:09:21.513
I'm a terrible. terrible ghost.

938
01:09:23.770 --> 01:09:25.977
- Pull yourself together. Bob.

939
01:09:25.977 --> 01:09:28.144
(sobbing)

940
01:09:31.270 --> 01:09:33.452
There must be something we can do.

941
01:09:35.649 --> 01:09:37.817
(sobbing)

942
01:09:41.444 --> 01:09:42.740
- I've got all sorts of bits and bobs

943
01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:44.180
in my wardrobe. Mrs. Jones.

944
01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:46.030
I'm a bit of a magpie. to be honest.

945
01:09:46.030 --> 01:09:48.440
Hopefully we can find alook that's more suitable.

946
01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:50.490
You know. woo!

947
01:09:50.490 --> 01:09:51.987
Without being too. you know...

948
01:09:51.987 --> 01:09:54.404
Eurghhh!

949
01:09:59.165 --> 01:10:02.757
- Are you preparing towalk through the door?

950
01:10:02.757 --> 01:10:05.210
- I'm trying to rememberwhere I left my key.

951
01:10:05.210 --> 01:10:06.043
- Oh!

952
01:10:11.702 --> 01:10:12.952
Get in. get in.

953
01:10:19.231 --> 01:10:22.314
(lighthearted music)

954
01:10:25.451 --> 01:10:30.451
- Hello. Mrs. Jones.my name's Mr. Cuddles!

955
01:10:36.903 --> 01:10:39.486
(catchy music)

956
01:11:19.050 --> 01:11:21.040
I'll go and put anoutfit on then. shall I?

957
01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:31.040
- What's that under your arm?

958
01:11:32.309 --> 01:11:34.000
- It's my head.

959
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.309
I'm a headless ghost.

960
01:11:35.309 --> 01:11:37.150
- Headless ghost?

961
01:11:37.150 --> 01:11:39.843
But I can see your headwhere your actual head is.

962
01:11:41.166 --> 01:11:43.510
- Well. I haven't worked on that bit yet.

963
01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:45.870
- Like I said. I'm findingthis whole ghost thing

964
01:11:45.870 --> 01:11:46.963
all very difficult.

965
01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:49.540
- What other outfits have you got?

966
01:11:55.700 --> 01:11:58.243
- It's very nice to meet you!

967
01:11:59.456 --> 01:12:00.289
- No.

968
01:12:05.844 --> 01:12:08.994
- I've got a present for Mrs. Jones.

969
01:12:08.994 --> 01:12:11.911
(mysterious music)

970
01:12:15.342 --> 01:12:17.778
(Mrs. Jones screams)

971
01:12:17.778 --> 01:12:18.611
- No.

972
01:12:20.250 --> 01:12:22.410
Have we got a problem here. Bob?

973
01:12:22.410 --> 01:12:23.510
- I'm starting to get-

974
01:12:24.397 --> 01:12:25.230
- What?

975
01:12:25.230 --> 01:12:26.080
- A little bit-- Little bit-

976
01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:27.190
- Ticked off.

977
01:12:27.190 --> 01:12:28.240
- Harsh words. Bob.

978
01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:29.570
- I've given you loads of options.

979
01:12:29.570 --> 01:12:31.800
but you don't seem to like any of them.

980
01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:33.407
It's really quite...

981
01:12:33.407 --> 01:12:34.499
frustrating.

982
01:12:34.499 --> 01:12:35.332
- Frustrating?

983
01:12:35.332 --> 01:12:36.165
- Mm.

984
01:12:36.165 --> 01:12:37.809
- You should try being a hotel manager.

985
01:12:37.809 --> 01:12:40.280
You have to please allthe guests all the time.

986
01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:42.710
and you have to smile all the time.

987
01:12:42.710 --> 01:12:45.460
And when you want to getrid of a member of staff.

988
01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:48.273
well. the paperwork is a nightmare!

989
01:12:49.130 --> 01:12:52.630
- Well. let me tell yousomething. Mrs. Jones.

990
01:12:52.630 --> 01:12:54.246
I might be a rubbish ghost.

991
01:12:54.246 --> 01:12:56.070
but I'm certainly no quitter.

992
01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:59.430
- What's the plan. Bob?

993
01:12:59.430 --> 01:13:00.330
- One more outfit.

994
01:13:01.450 --> 01:13:02.282
Make or break.

995
01:13:03.389 --> 01:13:04.223
This is it.

996
01:13:08.568 --> 01:13:10.035
(Mrs. Jones exhales)

997
01:13:18.996 --> 01:13:20.987
Are you ready. Mrs. Jones?

998
01:13:20.987 --> 01:13:21.843
- Yes.

999
01:13:21.843 --> 01:13:22.675
Get on with it.

1000
01:13:27.213 --> 01:13:29.546
(Bob wails)

1001
01:13:31.342 --> 01:13:33.150
(laughing)

1002
01:13:33.150 --> 01:13:35.450
Are you winding me up?

1003
01:13:35.450 --> 01:13:36.282
- What?

1004
01:13:37.170 --> 01:13:38.520
It's a classic.

1005
01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:40.870
The absolute pinnacle of ghostliness.

1006
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:43.760
The most recognizable anduniversally appreciated

1007
01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:45.154
symbol of eeriness.

1008
01:13:45.154 --> 01:13:46.430
- It's ridiculous!

1009
01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:47.840
- I think it makes a statement.

1010
01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.800
I'm a ghost. deal with it.

1011
01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:50.834
- Take it off.

1012
01:13:50.834 --> 01:13:51.666
- No.

1013
01:13:51.666 --> 01:13:53.239
- Take it off now!- No.

1014
01:13:53.239 --> 01:13:55.214
- Get it off!- No. I won't.

1015
01:13:55.214 --> 01:13:56.389
- Get if off. come on!

1016
01:13:56.389 --> 01:13:58.027
(groaning)

1017
01:13:58.027 --> 01:14:00.527
(tense music)

1018
01:14:03.481 --> 01:14:05.373
(Mrs. Jones screams)

1019
01:14:05.373 --> 01:14:06.831
(a dull thud)

1020
01:14:18.431 --> 01:14:19.809
Now...

1021
01:14:19.809 --> 01:14:21.452
Look what you've done!

1022
01:14:27.636 --> 01:14:31.420
You complete and utter idiot!

1023
01:14:32.296 --> 01:14:34.713
(bell rings)

1024
01:14:35.867 --> 01:14:40.493
(fingers tapping)(catchy music)

1025
01:14:40.493 --> 01:14:43.599
(giggling)

1026
01:14:46.719 --> 01:14:47.559
Come over here!

1027
01:14:47.559 --> 01:14:48.559
- Alright.

1028
01:14:49.718 --> 01:14:51.010
How would you like me?

1029
01:14:51.010 --> 01:14:52.919
- That's perfect. yeah.

1030
01:14:54.364 --> 01:14:55.800
(Mrs. Jones wails)

1031
01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:56.760
- [Woman] Oh my gosh!

1032
01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:58.460
- [Man] What's going on?

1033
01:14:58.460 --> 01:14:59.860
- [Woman] What is she doin'?

1034
01:15:01.333 --> 01:15:03.583
(coughing)

1035
01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:07.080
Is that meant to be scary?

1036
01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:08.816
- [Man] She must be mad.

1037
01:15:08.816 --> 01:15:11.760
(Mrs. Jones coughs)

1038
01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:13.223
Excuse me. can we help you?

1039
01:15:16.358 --> 01:15:18.608
(glass smashes)

1040
01:15:28.386 --> 01:15:33.386
(ATM beeping)

1041
01:15:53.599 --> 01:15:54.442
- Oh. Jesus.

1042
01:15:54.442 --> 01:15:56.117
Dobby. slow down!

1043
01:16:01.416 --> 01:16:04.666
This isn't doin' my health any good Dobby.

1044
01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:11.870
Slow down. don't drawattention to ourselves.

1045
01:16:12.410 --> 01:16:13.597
Christ.

1046
01:16:13.597 --> 01:16:16.764
I'm starting to feel a bit Uncle Dick.

1047
01:16:25.528 --> 01:16:26.968
(groaning)

1048
01:16:26.968 --> 01:16:28.526
- You...

1049
01:16:28.526 --> 01:16:29.626
Have...

1050
01:16:29.626 --> 01:16:30.732
Arrived...

1051
01:16:30.732 --> 01:16:31.565
- Give it.

1052
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:36.950
- Leave it out. George. your missus

1053
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:39.373
wouldn't even trustyou with her TV remote.

1054
01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:42.253
- Not exactly a Premier Inn.

1055
01:16:44.032 --> 01:16:46.450
- It's perfect.

1056
01:16:58.070 --> 01:17:01.559
Beers top floor. stairlift broken.

1057
01:17:01.559 --> 01:17:02.490
Sorry.

1058
01:17:02.490 --> 01:17:04.553
Remind me to give Hobbit a smack.

1059
01:17:13.817 --> 01:17:16.317
(tense music)

1060
01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:25.366
- Scary. innit?

1061
01:17:25.366 --> 01:17:27.600
- Not as scary as your driving. Dobby.

1062
01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:28.612
- Ha ha.

1063
01:17:28.612 --> 01:17:29.446
- Come on!

1064
01:17:30.409 --> 01:17:33.076
(heartbeats)

1065
01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:38.253
(heavy breathing)

1066
01:17:39.512 --> 01:17:42.380
- You alright. George. mate?

1067
01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:43.393
- A bit sick.

1068
01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:45.413
- Car sick?

1069
01:17:46.309 --> 01:17:48.029
- Sick of your ugly mug.

1070
01:17:48.029 --> 01:17:50.590
(laughing)(whispering)

1071
01:17:50.590 --> 01:17:51.980
Do you hear that?

1072
01:17:53.133 --> 01:17:54.540
- It's probably Hobbit.

1073
01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:56.734
- Or your tinnitus.- Come on.

1074
01:17:56.734 --> 01:17:57.567
- Yeah.

1075
01:18:01.583 --> 01:18:04.500
(mysterious music)

1076
01:18:26.410 --> 01:18:28.166
- Well. you've made it.

1077
01:18:28.166 --> 01:18:29.440
(laughing)

1078
01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:31.612
- It went like a dream. Hobbit.

1079
01:18:32.523 --> 01:18:34.396
- Yes!- Yes!

1080
01:18:34.396 --> 01:18:36.646
(laughing)

1081
01:18:39.050 --> 01:18:40.697
- Mickey. boy. we did it.

1082
01:18:41.893 --> 01:18:43.843
The last of the Deptford 8.

1083
01:18:44.710 --> 01:18:46.730
- To the five of us.

1084
01:18:46.730 --> 01:18:51.110
God bless Tonka and Pat. fallen comrades.

1085
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:52.750
God bless Lenny.

1086
01:18:52.750 --> 01:18:54.700
- Like you could've done it without me.

1087
01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:57.469
I'm surprised you found your way upstairs

1088
01:18:57.469 --> 01:18:58.910
without a pack of guide dogs.

1089
01:18:58.910 --> 01:19:00.809
- That's enough of your lip. sunshine.

1090
01:19:03.754 --> 01:19:06.421
(jarring music and screams)

1091
01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:08.930
Right.

1092
01:19:08.930 --> 01:19:11.389
Check the money. every note.

1093
01:19:11.389 --> 01:19:13.177
Any new ones. burn 'em!

1094
01:19:15.972 --> 01:19:18.639
(heart beating)

1095
01:19:31.451 --> 01:19:33.823
- Is that your granddaughter?

1096
01:19:33.823 --> 01:19:34.773
- My little Debbie.

1097
01:19:35.969 --> 01:19:36.920
Isn't she gorgeous?

1098
01:19:38.559 --> 01:19:41.050
I don't want her ending up like us.

1099
01:19:41.050 --> 01:19:42.503
She's gonna be respectable.

1100
01:19:48.639 --> 01:19:50.303
It's family that matters. Mick.

1101
01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:53.643
I'm doing this so she doesn't have to.

1102
01:19:59.389 --> 01:20:00.633
Is anyone else here?

1103
01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:05.213
Terry. Dobby.

1104
01:20:05.213 --> 01:20:06.940
give the place a look.

1105
01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:07.773
Make sure.

1106
01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:16.000
How did you find this place?

1107
01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.393
- People say it's haunted.

1108
01:20:18.330 --> 01:20:21.770
They keep seeing theses old.

1109
01:20:21.770 --> 01:20:25.030
decrepit corpses wandering around.

1110
01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:27.163
so you two should feel right at home.

1111
01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:29.809
- When I was your age.

1112
01:20:29.809 --> 01:20:33.180
I was out there with a shootertaking what I was owed.

1113
01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:34.889
You're just a bed wetter

1114
01:20:34.889 --> 01:20:36.170
sat in front of your laptop

1115
01:20:36.170 --> 01:20:37.610
and talking like a tart.

1116
01:20:37.610 --> 01:20:40.573
- Well the days of shootingyour way out are long gone.

1117
01:20:41.969 --> 01:20:43.480
- When you've lived as long as I have.

1118
01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:45.660
you'll find that havingthe balls to fire a gun

1119
01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:48.596
buys you a lot of influence in this world.

1120
01:20:48.596 --> 01:20:50.487
(intense heartbeats)

1121
01:20:50.487 --> 01:20:52.737
(choking)

1122
01:21:03.530 --> 01:21:05.094
- Boss?

1123
01:21:05.094 --> 01:21:05.928
BOSS?!

1124
01:21:09.410 --> 01:21:10.243
- Well?

1125
01:21:11.180 --> 01:21:12.013
- Nothing.

1126
01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:17.670
- Where's Dobby?

1127
01:21:17.670 --> 01:21:19.090
- Who?

1128
01:21:19.090 --> 01:21:19.923
- Dobby.

1129
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:21.983
- Don't know him.

1130
01:21:21.983 --> 01:21:24.400
- Are you muggin' me off?

1131
01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:26.290
Jackie Dobson.

1132
01:21:26.290 --> 01:21:27.870
Don't mess me about Tel!

1133
01:21:27.870 --> 01:21:31.243
- Boss. it's just thefour of us. and the kid.

1134
01:21:33.304 --> 01:21:34.350
- Have you all lost it?

1135
01:21:34.350 --> 01:21:35.883
Dobby was with us tonight.

1136
01:21:37.130 --> 01:21:38.520
He drove us here!

1137
01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:41.433
- Are you alright?

1138
01:21:41.433 --> 01:21:42.266
- Huh?

1139
01:21:43.150 --> 01:21:43.983
Yeah.

1140
01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:51.550
- He's cracking up.

1141
01:21:51.550 --> 01:21:52.383
- Shut up!

1142
01:21:55.764 --> 01:21:57.246
Boss.

1143
01:21:57.246 --> 01:22:00.370
We're all here. we're all fine.

1144
01:22:00.370 --> 01:22:03.653
and the main thing is. we've got this.

1145
01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:08.450
- This place reminds me ofthat pub on the highroad.

1146
01:22:08.450 --> 01:22:10.590
Massive rambling place.

1147
01:22:10.590 --> 01:22:11.945
- Oh. yeah.

1148
01:22:11.945 --> 01:22:12.830
Yeah!

1149
01:22:12.830 --> 01:22:14.700
The Black Horse!

1150
01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:16.920
You used to run that with Lenny Maitland.

1151
01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:18.120
Right. George?

1152
01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:20.170
- Tricky little fella. Lenny.

1153
01:22:20.170 --> 01:22:22.614
Disappeared with your money. didn't he?

1154
01:22:22.614 --> 01:22:24.164
- Shut up about Lenny Maitland.

1155
01:22:26.260 --> 01:22:28.230
Go and get the rest of the gear.

1156
01:22:28.230 --> 01:22:29.360
- Okay. Boss.

1157
01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:30.723
Just need to take a leak.

1158
01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:32.723
- Hurry up.

1159
01:22:34.384 --> 01:22:36.800
(man peeing)

1160
01:22:41.534 --> 01:22:43.620
What's going on Tel?

1161
01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:45.440
Am I cracking up?

1162
01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:47.903
- We're all cream crackered. Boss.

1163
01:22:48.911 --> 01:22:52.043
- I can't believe you don'tremember Jackie Dobson.

1164
01:22:56.330 --> 01:22:57.230
Come on. Mountain.

1165
01:22:58.460 --> 01:22:59.713
Sort yourself out.

1166
01:23:00.719 --> 01:23:02.077
- Mountain?

1167
01:23:03.559 --> 01:23:05.612
What Mountain?

1168
01:23:05.612 --> 01:23:07.568
- Are you kiddin' me?

1169
01:23:07.568 --> 01:23:08.401
Mountain!

1170
01:23:09.909 --> 01:23:11.492
He's in the khazi!

1171
01:23:15.672 --> 01:23:18.422
(dramatic music)

1172
01:23:25.093 --> 01:23:27.270
- There's no one else here. mate.

1173
01:23:27.270 --> 01:23:28.570
Just the four of us.

1174
01:23:28.570 --> 01:23:30.200
- The four of us?

1175
01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:31.520
There were six of us just now.

1176
01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:33.730
Are you scamming me. Mickey?

1177
01:23:33.730 --> 01:23:35.070
- Calm down!

1178
01:23:35.070 --> 01:23:36.508
Don't go into one.

1179
01:23:36.508 --> 01:23:37.853
- Now you and I go back a long way.

1180
01:23:37.853 --> 01:23:39.755
and you know what I doto people who cross me.

1181
01:23:39.755 --> 01:23:42.505
so are you gonna tell me what's going on?

1182
01:23:42.505 --> 01:23:44.361
- [Hobbit] What's goingon is you're senile.

1183
01:23:44.361 --> 01:23:45.193
- You little-

1184
01:23:45.193 --> 01:23:47.290
- Mate. you need to calm down!

1185
01:23:47.290 --> 01:23:48.343
You're not well.

1186
01:23:51.136 --> 01:23:53.670
- [Hobbit] That's right.take a chill pill.

1187
01:23:53.670 --> 01:23:55.750
- Look. you shut up. sonny!

1188
01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:59.270
- Done something to my pills. haven't you?

1189
01:23:59.270 --> 01:24:00.267
- [Hobbit] What pills?

1190
01:24:00.267 --> 01:24:03.503
- Oh. I'm gonna get dark with you. son!

1191
01:24:07.278 --> 01:24:08.660
What's happened to the lights?

1192
01:24:08.660 --> 01:24:10.621
- It's derelict. innit?

1193
01:24:10.621 --> 01:24:12.170
The leccy's been off for years.

1194
01:24:12.170 --> 01:24:13.750
- Losing it. George?

1195
01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:16.403
- Terry. brass knuckles.

1196
01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:18.153
Terry!

1197
01:24:19.410 --> 01:24:20.782
- It's just me and you.

1198
01:24:21.889 --> 01:24:23.503
the last of the Deptford 5.

1199
01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:26.850
And Hobbit. if he counts.

1200
01:24:26.850 --> 01:24:28.740
- [George] Deptford 5?

1201
01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:33.420
Terry. Dobby. you can all come out now!

1202
01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:34.545
Do I look like the kind of mug

1203
01:24:34.545 --> 01:24:36.190
that's gonna let you take his money?

1204
01:24:37.981 --> 01:24:40.782
- Is that what Lenny Maitland tried to do?

1205
01:24:40.782 --> 01:24:41.800
- You what?

1206
01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:44.860
- He never ran off with your money.

1207
01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:46.389
You made sure of it.

1208
01:24:46.389 --> 01:24:47.223
- Yeah.

1209
01:24:48.620 --> 01:24:50.803
I see the resemblance now.

1210
01:24:53.465 --> 01:24:56.500
Are you trying to avenge your family?

1211
01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:59.083
I tell you what. I did kill Lenny.

1212
01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:02.750
I bricked your granddad up in the basement

1213
01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:04.433
of the Black Horse Hotel.

1214
01:25:05.543 --> 01:25:07.950
- Oh. yeah. I remember.

1215
01:25:07.950 --> 01:25:10.573
You sent me down to thecellar to change a barrel.

1216
01:25:11.450 --> 01:25:12.980
hit me from behind.

1217
01:25:12.980 --> 01:25:15.639
next thing I remember.I'm chained to a pipe.

1218
01:25:15.639 --> 01:25:18.333
brick after brick going up in front of me.

1219
01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:21.473
I begged you for mercy.

1220
01:25:22.469 --> 01:25:24.160
but you just...

1221
01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:25.800
You stood there and laughed.

1222
01:25:28.675 --> 01:25:29.947
- Who are you?

1223
01:25:29.947 --> 01:25:31.920
- How many other mateshave you double-crossed

1224
01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:33.130
over the years. eh?

1225
01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:35.050
What about tonight?

1226
01:25:36.010 --> 01:25:37.610
You got any plans?

1227
01:25:37.610 --> 01:25:39.335
(gun fires)

1228
01:25:39.335 --> 01:25:40.286
(body slumps)

1229
01:25:41.127 --> 01:25:43.511
- What have you done. George?

1230
01:25:43.511 --> 01:25:44.486
He was one of us!

1231
01:25:44.486 --> 01:25:46.400
- Ah. you remember him!

1232
01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:50.166
But you don't rememberTerry. or Dobby. or Mountain?

1233
01:25:51.276 --> 01:25:52.383
- Please. George!

1234
01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:54.173
- What?

1235
01:25:55.047 --> 01:25:57.610
You want me to think I'm going mad?

1236
01:25:57.610 --> 01:25:59.370
Big mistake.

1237
01:25:59.370 --> 01:26:00.820
You should've just killed me.

1238
01:26:02.270 --> 01:26:03.969
That's what I was gonna do to you.

1239
01:26:05.077 --> 01:26:06.553
- Go to hell George.

1240
01:26:06.553 --> 01:26:09.053
(intense heartbeats)

1241
01:26:12.391 --> 01:26:13.224
(dull thud)

1242
01:26:25.108 --> 01:26:27.858
(George shrieks)

1243
01:26:30.398 --> 01:26:32.566
(sobbing)

1244
01:26:41.093 --> 01:26:42.175
- Tonka. Pat?

1245
01:26:44.697 --> 01:26:45.530
No way.

1246
01:26:46.898 --> 01:26:49.440
- The last of the Deptford 8.

1247
01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:51.563
They'd like a word. George.

1248
01:26:54.660 --> 01:26:56.219
- What's happened to my Debbie?

1249
01:26:56.219 --> 01:26:58.389
If you've hurt her...

1250
01:26:58.389 --> 01:27:00.719
- There is no Debbie.

1251
01:27:00.719 --> 01:27:01.853
There's no family.

1252
01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:04.083
They never existed.

1253
01:27:07.648 --> 01:27:10.451
(gun fires)

1254
01:27:10.451 --> 01:27:14.368
(ominous music and voices build)

1255
01:27:14.368 --> 01:27:16.993
(George screams)

1256
01:27:30.405 --> 01:27:33.370
- [Terry] This is the wayhe would've wanted to go.

1257
01:27:33.370 --> 01:27:35.063
On a job with his mates.

1258
01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:38.170
- We said no shooters on this one.

1259
01:27:38.170 --> 01:27:39.160
You don't reckon he would've-

1260
01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:41.380
- No way. not George.

1261
01:27:41.380 --> 01:27:42.717
He wouldn't turn on one of his own.

1262
01:27:42.717 --> 01:27:44.827
- He was a true gent. alright.

1263
01:27:44.827 --> 01:27:47.570
- We'll take care ofyour little Debbie. Boss.

1264
01:27:47.570 --> 01:27:49.030
- Yeah.

1265
01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:50.702
He would've done the same for us.

1266
01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:55.047
- He's in a better place now.

1267
01:27:55.933 --> 01:27:58.366
(dramatic music builds)

1268
01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:03.490
(cursed screams)
