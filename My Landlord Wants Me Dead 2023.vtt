3
00:00:17.452 --> 00:00:18.931
Tell me what?

4
00:00:19.062 --> 00:00:20.368
Was that Kevin?

5
00:00:20.498 --> 00:00:22.718
Yeah. I'm moving in with him.

6
00:00:22.805 --> 00:00:24.459
We're in love.

7
00:00:24.546 --> 00:00:27.592
I'm the one
that's in love with you.

8
00:00:27.723 --> 00:00:30.595
Flattered. seriously.
but. um...

9
00:00:30.726 --> 00:00:32.509
-we can't...
-No. no. no. wait. wait. no.

10
00:00:32.641 --> 00:00:34.817
-Let go!
-I want you to stay here

11
00:00:34.904 --> 00:00:36.253
with me!

12
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.690
I don't love you!

13
00:01:20.167 --> 00:01:22.430
Sorry. I didn't know
it was gonna be this far.

14
00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:34.398
I just don't understand
why she has to stay here.

15
00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:36.313
I told you already.

16
00:01:36.444 --> 00:01:38.271
Ever since
Maddie's mom passed away.

17
00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:39.969
she's gone into a tailspin.

18
00:01:40.056 --> 00:01:42.667
she's failed out of college.
she's completely broke.

19
00:01:42.753 --> 00:01:45.104
She just needs a little help
getting back on her feet.

20
00:01:45.235 --> 00:01:46.932
Well. tell her to get
a cheap motel. then.

21
00:01:47.019 --> 00:01:48.586
Why? This place is empty.

22
00:01:48.717 --> 00:01:51.067
We both live in the city.
You won't let me rent it out.

23
00:01:51.198 --> 00:01:55.115
-you won't let me sell it.
-I'm just not ready.

24
00:02:24.753 --> 00:02:26.711
Well. how long
is she gonna be here?

25
00:02:29.236 --> 00:02:30.715
Must be Maddie.

26
00:02:30.802 --> 00:02:32.848
Well. tell her she has
to stay outta this bedroom.

27
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.807
Yeah. She can stay
in the guest room.

28
00:02:39.333 --> 00:02:40.508
Aunt Grace.

29
00:02:40.638 --> 00:02:43.119
Maddie!

30
00:02:43.206 --> 00:02:44.642
How long has it been?

31
00:02:44.773 --> 00:02:47.515
-Um...
-Come in. come in!

32
00:02:49.647 --> 00:02:52.868
-How old were you?
-I don't know. maybe 12?

33
00:02:52.954 --> 00:02:54.043
That's right.

34
00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:56.045
You were asking everyone
for training bras

35
00:02:56.132 --> 00:02:57.307
for your birthday.

36
00:03:04.836 --> 00:03:06.751
I didn't find out
about your mom's passing

37
00:03:06.882 --> 00:03:08.405
until it was too late.

38
00:03:08.536 --> 00:03:10.233
That's okay.

39
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.192
I would have gone
to the funeral.

40
00:03:12.322 --> 00:03:14.106
It's okay. Aunt Grace.

41
00:03:14.237 --> 00:03:16.370
Really. It's fine.

42
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.025
I'm just glad
we got to reconnect.

43
00:03:20.112 --> 00:03:22.202
Well. you're here now.

44
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.077
You have such a nice house.

45
00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:29.600
Thanks!

46
00:03:29.731 --> 00:03:31.907
Paul and I have really
enjoyed it over the years.

47
00:03:32.037 --> 00:03:33.735
He's been spending
a lot more time here

48
00:03:33.822 --> 00:03:36.085
since we lost our tenant.

49
00:03:37.347 --> 00:03:40.002
But we love
our place in the city.

50
00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:41.569
Are you okay?

51
00:03:47.096 --> 00:03:49.838
Paul and I have been going
through a rough patch.

52
00:03:49.925 --> 00:03:53.755
Um...things just haven't been
the same for about a year.

53
00:03:53.885 --> 00:03:56.105
So sorry to hear that.

54
00:03:56.192 --> 00:03:58.194
Marriage can be tough.

55
00:03:58.281 --> 00:04:00.675
Any relationship
can be tough.

56
00:04:00.762 --> 00:04:04.156
You saw that
with your mom and I.

57
00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:07.638
Are you sure
you should still go?

58
00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.292
To Africa?

59
00:04:12.208 --> 00:04:14.254
I think it'll do us some good.

60
00:04:14.341 --> 00:04:15.951
Ugh. I'm so nervous. too.

61
00:04:16.038 --> 00:04:18.475
It's my first commission
on that side of the world. so...

62
00:04:18.606 --> 00:04:19.998
But you take such good pictures!

63
00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:21.913
You're gonna do great.

64
00:04:22.043 --> 00:04:23.132
What about you?

65
00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:25.003
Have you kept up
with your photography?

66
00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:28.180
Your mom mentioned it once.

67
00:04:28.311 --> 00:04:30.966
said you couldn't focus
on biology because. uh.

68
00:04:31.096 --> 00:04:33.011
you were too busy
being an artist.

69
00:04:35.187 --> 00:04:38.495
Well. that may have been
part of the reason. but...

70
00:04:38.582 --> 00:04:40.628
I don't know.
I just love it.

71
00:04:40.758 --> 00:04:42.630
Just staring outside
at the scenery

72
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.111
is getting my creative juices
flowing.

73
00:04:46.242 --> 00:04:49.289
I can feel your mom's eyes
rollin' from heaven at me

74
00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:50.812
right now.

75
00:04:50.942 --> 00:04:51.987
Me too.

76
00:04:54.511 --> 00:04:56.121
You know what?

77
00:04:56.207 --> 00:04:58.167
You are more than welcome
to use the camera equipment

78
00:04:58.298 --> 00:04:59.690
I'm not taking with me
to Africa.

79
00:04:59.821 --> 00:05:01.605
I mean. some of it's
pretty dated. but...

80
00:05:01.736 --> 00:05:04.216
I'd love to see what you do
with it while I'm gone.

81
00:05:04.347 --> 00:05:07.176
Gosh. thank you!

82
00:05:08.395 --> 00:05:11.398
Well. you should
probably meet Paul.

83
00:05:14.618 --> 00:05:18.361
Paul?
This is my niece Maddie.

84
00:05:18.492 --> 00:05:20.581
Hi. Paul!

85
00:05:20.711 --> 00:05:23.671
Thanks again for letting me
stay here for a while.

86
00:05:23.801 --> 00:05:26.500
I just need a fresh start
is all.

87
00:05:26.587 --> 00:05:28.676
I'm not really happy
about you staying here.

88
00:05:28.763 --> 00:05:31.243
but since you're
Grace's niece. fine.

89
00:05:31.374 --> 00:05:33.507
I just have one rule:

90
00:05:33.594 --> 00:05:35.422
Stay out of this bedroom.

91
00:05:44.866 --> 00:05:46.998
See what I've been
dealing with?

92
00:05:47.085 --> 00:05:50.088
He's been so difficult lately.

93
00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:52.047
I swear. men are
oversized toddlers.

94
00:05:54.615 --> 00:05:58.227
Listen. Maddie.

95
00:05:58.314 --> 00:06:01.012
I'm not sure what's gonna happen
when I come back. but...

96
00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:02.579
if things don't change.

97
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.799
I'm afraid this is
the end of Paul and I.

98
00:06:04.886 --> 00:06:07.279
Don't say that!

99
00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.891
It's true.

100
00:06:10.021 --> 00:06:13.590
which is one of the reasons why
I'm super excited you're here.

101
00:06:13.721 --> 00:06:16.158
If you can help me
get this place into shape.

102
00:06:16.288 --> 00:06:17.725
I could put it
on the market.

103
00:06:17.812 --> 00:06:19.161
Who knows?

104
00:06:19.248 --> 00:06:20.902
Maybe you can help me sell it

105
00:06:21.032 --> 00:06:22.382
and I can give you commission.

106
00:06:22.512 --> 00:06:24.035
Of course!

107
00:06:24.122 --> 00:06:26.386
Anything for you.
Aunt Grace.

108
00:06:26.473 --> 00:06:31.565
Again. I really appreciate
you letting me stay here.

109
00:06:31.652 --> 00:06:33.088
Oh.

110
00:06:33.175 --> 00:06:35.351
And there's one more
important thing

111
00:06:35.482 --> 00:06:37.266
I need to discuss with you.

112
00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:40.051
What is it?

113
00:06:40.138 --> 00:06:42.576
I guess there's no way
of beating around the bush.

114
00:06:42.663 --> 00:06:46.623
Um. Paul and I never got around
to putting internet here.

115
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.408
That's it?

116
00:06:48.495 --> 00:06:50.801
Yes. that's it.

117
00:06:50.888 --> 00:06:53.282
Honestly. my phone's
probably gonna shut off here

118
00:06:53.369 --> 00:06:54.979
soon anyway.
but you know what?

119
00:06:55.066 --> 00:06:57.417
I'm actually looking forward
to just tuning out

120
00:06:57.547 --> 00:06:59.201
and turning off
the rest of the world.

121
00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:01.595
Oh. good!

122
00:07:01.682 --> 00:07:03.379
I wasn't sure
how you were gonna take that.

123
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:06.382
Oh. and the cell reception
is spotty.

124
00:07:06.513 --> 00:07:11.213
Otherwise. the landline
works perfectly great.

125
00:07:11.343 --> 00:07:13.520
What is that thing?

126
00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:14.825
Just kidding.

127
00:07:14.912 --> 00:07:17.262
I saw one
on the History Channel once.

128
00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:19.482
Oh. you're funny.

129
00:07:19.613 --> 00:07:21.092
Come on!

130
00:07:23.747 --> 00:07:26.141
And we have
a fully stocked wine rack.

131
00:07:26.271 --> 00:07:28.230
which you're more than welcome
to raid.

132
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.797
Is this heaven?!

133
00:07:35.498 --> 00:07:38.153
Oh my God. I can't believe
you remember that.

134
00:07:39.371 --> 00:07:40.851
How could I forget?

135
00:07:44.986 --> 00:07:46.596
Any last questions?

136
00:07:46.683 --> 00:07:48.729
No. I don't think so.

137
00:07:48.816 --> 00:07:51.034
Again. I really do
appreciate it.

138
00:07:51.166 --> 00:07:52.907
Please.
Just make yourself at home.

139
00:07:52.994 --> 00:07:55.475
All the important numbers
are on the fridge.

140
00:07:55.562 --> 00:07:57.781
And should anything go wrong.
just--

141
00:07:57.912 --> 00:07:59.000
I know. I know.

142
00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:02.046
You'll be in Africa.
so just call Paul.

143
00:08:02.133 --> 00:08:03.874
Got it.

144
00:08:04.005 --> 00:08:07.051
I'll make sure Paul checks
on you every so often.

145
00:08:07.138 --> 00:08:09.271
Yeah. I'll be sure
to do that.

146
00:08:09.358 --> 00:08:12.622
Okay. Thanks.

147
00:08:12.709 --> 00:08:14.319
Take care. Maddie.

148
00:08:14.406 --> 00:08:16.147
I'll see you
when I get back.

149
00:08:16.278 --> 00:08:18.367
-Have a great time.
-I will.

150
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.212
I'm leaving.

151
00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:38.996
Don't burn the place down.

152
00:09:18.253 --> 00:09:19.602
Great.

153
00:10:03.777 --> 00:10:06.127
Who are you?

154
00:10:10.218 --> 00:10:12.829
Oh. shoot! No...

155
00:11:00.094 --> 00:11:01.225
Um. hello?

156
00:11:01.356 --> 00:11:02.531
Hey. girl.

157
00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:03.619
Maddie?

158
00:11:03.706 --> 00:11:05.403
Where are you
calling me from?

159
00:11:05.534 --> 00:11:07.362
My aunt's--
are you ready for this--

160
00:11:07.449 --> 00:11:10.495
-rotary phone.
-What? No way.

161
00:11:10.626 --> 00:11:13.585
Yeah. I-I kinda misplaced
my cell phone.

162
00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:15.413
Oh.

163
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.807
So how long do you plan
on staying out there?

164
00:11:17.938 --> 00:11:19.026
I don't know.

165
00:11:19.113 --> 00:11:21.202
Until I get
my act together?

166
00:11:21.332 --> 00:11:23.944
Or I become
a famous photographer.

167
00:11:24.031 --> 00:11:25.336
Or they kick me out.

168
00:11:25.423 --> 00:11:26.686
"They"?

169
00:11:26.816 --> 00:11:29.906
Yeah. my aunt and her husband.

170
00:11:29.993 --> 00:11:32.169
I'm supposed to call him
if I need anything

171
00:11:32.256 --> 00:11:33.475
while she's away.

172
00:11:33.562 --> 00:11:36.521
Oh. wow. so he's like
your landlord now?

173
00:11:36.652 --> 00:11:38.175
Yeah. I guess.

174
00:11:38.306 --> 00:11:41.613
Anyway. there's also
this other guy.

175
00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:43.920
He lives next door.

176
00:11:44.051 --> 00:11:46.227
Is he cute?

177
00:11:46.314 --> 00:11:48.577
Uh. I wouldn't have
mentioned him if he wasn't.

178
00:11:49.926 --> 00:11:50.797
True.

179
00:11:50.927 --> 00:11:52.842
Anyway. he and Paul...

180
00:11:52.929 --> 00:11:55.279
-Paul?
-Yeah. the landlord.

181
00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:57.194
or my aunt's husband.

182
00:11:57.281 --> 00:11:58.674
he and the neighbor guy.

183
00:11:58.805 --> 00:12:00.458
they were staring at each other

184
00:12:00.589 --> 00:12:03.592
like there was some kind
of bad history there.

185
00:12:03.679 --> 00:12:06.290
Well. that should be fun.

186
00:12:06.421 --> 00:12:08.075
And the master bedroom
is locked.

187
00:12:08.205 --> 00:12:09.424
So weird.

188
00:12:09.511 --> 00:12:12.993
Anyway. I should probably
get to sleep.

189
00:12:13.123 --> 00:12:15.430
-Bye. girl.
-Bye.

Hey.

206
00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.159
Jesus!

207
00:14:59.289 --> 00:15:01.117
-Dude. you scared me.
-I know. I'm sorry.

208
00:15:01.204 --> 00:15:02.989
I knocked and I--
and I said something

209
00:15:03.119 --> 00:15:04.468
and I saw you in here.

210
00:15:04.599 --> 00:15:06.079
I just--I just wanted
to introduce myself.

211
00:15:06.209 --> 00:15:08.081
So you just decided
to walk right in?

212
00:15:08.168 --> 00:15:10.126
I know. Yeah. like. not cool.

213
00:15:10.257 --> 00:15:13.129
I am. like. full
of regret right now.

214
00:15:13.216 --> 00:15:16.480
I'll--I'll just
leave you alone. okay?

215
00:15:16.611 --> 00:15:20.528
Wait. uh...
I had my headphones on.

216
00:15:22.225 --> 00:15:24.184
That's why
I didn't hear you knock.

217
00:15:24.271 --> 00:15:25.750
Right.

218
00:15:25.837 --> 00:15:30.538
That makes sense.
because...yeah.

219
00:15:30.668 --> 00:15:34.455
Can I...start over and...

220
00:15:34.585 --> 00:15:37.066
Sure. Hi. I'm Maddie.

221
00:15:37.197 --> 00:15:40.113
and I will be staying here
for a couple months.

222
00:15:40.243 --> 00:15:41.984
-Grace is my aunt.
-Oh. very cool!

223
00:15:42.071 --> 00:15:43.464
Uh. I'm Kevin.

224
00:15:43.594 --> 00:15:46.597
I'm your...neighbor.

225
00:15:48.686 --> 00:15:50.819
I guess you already knew that.

226
00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:58.870
Wow.

227
00:15:59.001 --> 00:16:01.047
You know. the depths and detail
are really. uh.

228
00:16:01.177 --> 00:16:02.178
quite impressive.

229
00:16:05.181 --> 00:16:07.096
Yeah. and then.
my parents left.

230
00:16:07.183 --> 00:16:08.924
and I've been here ever since.

231
00:16:09.011 --> 00:16:11.057
I manage a few rental properties
in the area.

232
00:16:11.187 --> 00:16:12.101
It's pretty easy.

233
00:16:12.232 --> 00:16:13.146
It's been good.

234
00:16:13.233 --> 00:16:14.669
That's cool.

235
00:16:14.799 --> 00:16:17.846
Does it ever get lonely
out here?

236
00:16:17.933 --> 00:16:19.108
Yeah.

237
00:16:19.195 --> 00:16:20.544
Yeah. it does.

238
00:16:20.675 --> 00:16:23.634
Well. maybe you won't be
so lonely anymore.

239
00:16:23.721 --> 00:16:25.027
Yeah. maybe.

240
00:16:25.158 --> 00:16:26.724
Well. hey.
if you ever need anything.

241
00:16:26.855 --> 00:16:28.161
you know where I live.

242
00:16:28.248 --> 00:16:29.989
Is that why you stopped by?

243
00:16:30.119 --> 00:16:31.599
Huh? Oh. no. no. I...

244
00:16:31.729 --> 00:16:33.862
I was gonna ask you
if you'd seen my cat.

245
00:16:33.949 --> 00:16:37.561
He's gray. got stripes.
pink collar with "Jazzy" on it.

246
00:16:37.692 --> 00:16:38.998
-Jazzy?
-Mm-hmm.

247
00:16:40.651 --> 00:16:42.349
I haven't seen a cat.

248
00:16:42.479 --> 00:16:47.310
but I was hearing a bunch
of strange noises last night.

249
00:16:47.397 --> 00:16:50.183
-You can set that down.
-Oh. right. um...

250
00:16:51.662 --> 00:16:54.578
Well. some of that
might have been me.

251
00:16:54.665 --> 00:16:56.928
I was looking for Jazzy
out back.

252
00:16:57.059 --> 00:17:00.410
Sorry. but noises are just
a part of this place.

253
00:17:00.497 --> 00:17:03.718
You know. we got raccoons.
skunks. snakes. you name it.

254
00:17:03.848 --> 00:17:05.633
That doesn't sound too safe
for Jazzy.

255
00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.852
Exactly. I mean. you know.
he could hold his own.

256
00:17:07.939 --> 00:17:10.855
but I like to check in with him
every once in a while.

257
00:17:10.942 --> 00:17:14.381
Well. if I see him. I'll be sure
to give you a holler.

258
00:17:14.511 --> 00:17:15.556
Okay.

259
00:17:16.905 --> 00:17:18.776
Oh...

260
00:17:18.863 --> 00:17:20.082
Thank you for my picture.

261
00:17:21.474 --> 00:17:22.780
Oh. hey. uh.

262
00:17:22.911 --> 00:17:25.000
the other day when you were
working on your car.

263
00:17:25.131 --> 00:17:27.436
when my aunt left.
you and...

264
00:17:27.523 --> 00:17:30.832
You were looking at. uh...

265
00:17:30.919 --> 00:17:32.921
Yeah?

266
00:17:33.052 --> 00:17:35.184
Nothing. Never mind.

267
00:17:58.773 --> 00:18:02.255
Crushed. like it was ran over
by a semi truck ten times.

268
00:18:02.385 --> 00:18:05.910
That sucks.
Are you gonna get a new one?

269
00:18:05.997 --> 00:18:08.217
I don't really have the money
for that right now.

270
00:18:08.348 --> 00:18:10.524
Besides. there's no Wi-Fi.

271
00:18:10.611 --> 00:18:12.961
What? That's crazy.

272
00:18:13.048 --> 00:18:14.093
I know. right?

273
00:18:14.223 --> 00:18:15.790
I guess I'll just have to find

274
00:18:15.877 --> 00:18:17.400
other ways to entertain myself.

275
00:18:18.967 --> 00:18:20.708
Speaking of. I met the neighbor.

276
00:18:20.838 --> 00:18:22.623
and he's so cute!

277
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:24.494
Like a puppy.

278
00:18:24.581 --> 00:18:27.410
He's also a landlord.
and he named his cat Jazzy.

279
00:18:27.541 --> 00:18:28.977
How cute is that?

280
00:18:29.064 --> 00:18:32.546
Oh. God. here goes Maddie again
falling in love.

281
00:18:32.633 --> 00:18:34.113
What?

282
00:18:34.243 --> 00:18:37.290
I just said he's cute.
that's all.

283
00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:38.900
Anyway. did you ask him

284
00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:41.511
why he was staring down
your aunt's husband like that?

285
00:18:41.642 --> 00:18:44.340
I was going to.
but then I chickened out.

286
00:18:44.471 --> 00:18:47.300
Ask him. I mean. it might have
something to do with your aunt.

287
00:18:47.387 --> 00:18:49.258
I know. I know. I will.

288
00:18:49.389 --> 00:18:51.478
All right. I gotta go. girl.

289
00:18:51.565 --> 00:18:53.219
-Bye!
-Bye.

290
00:19:50.406 --> 00:19:52.452
Hello?

291
00:19:52.582 --> 00:19:54.018
Anyone there?

292
00:19:57.892 --> 00:19:59.154
Jazzy?

293
00:19:59.285 --> 00:20:01.852
Kitty. is that you?

294
00:20:01.939 --> 00:20:04.028
Your daddy's looking for you.

295
00:20:50.553 --> 00:20:52.163
Paul!

296
00:20:52.294 --> 00:20:54.078
What are you doing here?

297
00:20:54.209 --> 00:20:57.343
I just thought I'd stop by
and see how things are going.

298
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:59.388
Fine. but can't you
give me a heads up

299
00:20:59.475 --> 00:21:02.435
when you're coming over.
or ring the doorbell?

300
00:21:02.522 --> 00:21:04.567
Why would I?

301
00:21:04.654 --> 00:21:06.265
I have the key.

302
00:21:13.228 --> 00:21:17.885
Did you or did you not
spill wine on this pillow?

303
00:21:17.972 --> 00:21:19.190
I-I'm so sorry.

304
00:21:19.321 --> 00:21:21.367
I tried to get it out.

305
00:21:21.454 --> 00:21:24.457
I'll pay to have it cleaned
or whatever.

306
00:21:26.415 --> 00:21:29.505
I'm gonna go put
some clothes on. okay?

307
00:21:29.636 --> 00:21:31.420
You do that.

308
00:21:40.821 --> 00:21:41.909
Hey. Paul?

309
00:21:59.927 --> 00:22:01.581
I thought you left!

310
00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:04.845
Is everything okay?

311
00:22:04.975 --> 00:22:06.368
Why wouldn't it be?

312
00:22:06.455 --> 00:22:07.935
I smelled something weird.

313
00:22:08.065 --> 00:22:10.416
like lavender maybe?

314
00:22:15.072 --> 00:22:17.161
I-I just used the. uh...

315
00:22:17.248 --> 00:22:19.250
Bathroom?

316
00:22:19.338 --> 00:22:22.123
I lit a candle.
I was trying to...

317
00:22:22.253 --> 00:22:23.603
be polite. you know.

318
00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:25.996
Okay. that's cool.

319
00:22:26.083 --> 00:22:29.957
So. are you just gonna
leave it on or what?

320
00:22:30.044 --> 00:22:33.047
Don't go in there. that's our--

321
00:22:33.134 --> 00:22:35.528
It's a special place.

322
00:22:35.615 --> 00:22:37.617
Sure thing.

323
00:22:37.704 --> 00:22:39.314
By the way. did you. uh.

324
00:22:39.445 --> 00:22:42.491
did you turn up the thermostat?

325
00:22:42.578 --> 00:22:44.014
Yeah.

326
00:22:44.101 --> 00:22:45.494
A couple degrees.

327
00:22:45.581 --> 00:22:47.366
No.

328
00:22:47.453 --> 00:22:49.106
You turned it up three degrees.

329
00:22:49.237 --> 00:22:51.195
not a couple.

330
00:22:51.326 --> 00:22:54.242
It needs to stay at 65. or...

331
00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.159
Sixty-five.

332
00:22:58.246 --> 00:23:00.422
Sorry. I was cold.

333
00:23:00.553 --> 00:23:04.818
Maybe you should stop prancing
around in your underwear.

334
00:23:04.905 --> 00:23:06.950
Is there anything else I need
to take care of around here?

335
00:23:07.081 --> 00:23:09.039
Repair?

336
00:23:09.126 --> 00:23:11.302
Maybe more--
more wine stains. huh?

337
00:23:11.433 --> 00:23:14.784
No. I don't think so.

338
00:23:14.915 --> 00:23:16.569
All right.

339
00:23:16.656 --> 00:23:19.702
Oh. I. uh.
met the neighbor. Kevin.

340
00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:25.229
You know. if I were you.
I'd stay away from him.

341
00:24:12.102 --> 00:24:14.322
You found me!

342
00:24:14.409 --> 00:24:17.499
Lucky. my GPS disconnected
like five miles from here.

343
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:19.370
Oh. I know. it's the worst.

344
00:24:20.763 --> 00:24:22.112
Jazzy?

345
00:24:22.199 --> 00:24:23.462
Is that Boy-Toy?

346
00:24:25.551 --> 00:24:28.075
Hey. Kevin.

347
00:24:28.162 --> 00:24:30.947
Oh. hey!

348
00:24:31.078 --> 00:24:32.819
This is my friend Layla.

349
00:24:32.906 --> 00:24:34.864
Hi. Layla. nice to meet you.

350
00:24:34.951 --> 00:24:36.300
Nice to meet you.

351
00:24:36.387 --> 00:24:37.780
Have you found Jazzy yet?

352
00:24:37.911 --> 00:24:40.043
No. I was just looking for him.

353
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:41.305
I'm starting to worry.

354
00:24:41.436 --> 00:24:42.742
I'll keep an eye out.

355
00:24:44.744 --> 00:24:45.919
See ya.

356
00:24:48.835 --> 00:24:51.577
Take another one.
and make me look good this time.

357
00:24:53.796 --> 00:24:55.972
Gorgeous.

358
00:24:56.103 --> 00:24:58.322
He is so cute.

359
00:24:58.453 --> 00:25:00.455
If you don't take advantage
of that while you're here.

360
00:25:00.586 --> 00:25:03.502
I will disown you
and come and do it myself.

361
00:25:03.632 --> 00:25:06.113
I didn't come here
to get a boyfriend.

362
00:25:06.243 --> 00:25:08.637
Well. no one said anything
about getting a boyfriend.

363
00:25:08.724 --> 00:25:09.899
Layla!

364
00:25:12.815 --> 00:25:14.991
This place is so nice.

365
00:25:15.122 --> 00:25:18.168
Yeah. it is.

366
00:25:18.255 --> 00:25:23.130
But...it gets
a bit creepy at night.

367
00:25:23.217 --> 00:25:24.871
I don't know. I...

368
00:25:24.958 --> 00:25:27.961
I feel like there's
always someone watching me.

369
00:25:31.051 --> 00:25:32.443
Shut up!

370
00:25:32.531 --> 00:25:34.054
I do.

371
00:25:34.141 --> 00:25:35.882
You'll never guess
what happened this morning.

372
00:25:35.969 --> 00:25:37.536
I came out of the bathroom.

373
00:25:37.623 --> 00:25:40.713
and Paul was just sitting there
like a creep.

374
00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.236
The husband?

375
00:25:42.323 --> 00:25:44.107
Yes. and he was like.

376
00:25:44.238 --> 00:25:46.675
"Did you just spill wine
on this pillow?"

377
00:25:46.806 --> 00:25:48.372
Then he slammed the door.

378
00:25:48.503 --> 00:25:51.245
When I mentioned Kevin's name.

379
00:25:51.375 --> 00:25:53.203
he said to stay away from him.

380
00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:55.510
What? Why?

381
00:25:55.597 --> 00:25:58.339
I don't know. I have no idea.

382
00:25:58.469 --> 00:26:02.430
And then. I saw blood
on his sleeve and on the door.

383
00:26:02.561 --> 00:26:04.475
Blood?

384
00:26:04.563 --> 00:26:06.129
Are you sure
it wasn't the wine?

385
00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:09.002
I don't know. maybe. but...

386
00:26:09.089 --> 00:26:12.135
he was just so strange.

387
00:26:12.266 --> 00:26:14.485
I don't know why my aunt
keeps trying with him.

388
00:26:14.616 --> 00:26:16.705
Like. what does she
even see in him?

389
00:26:16.836 --> 00:26:19.186
Maybe he's just amazing in bed.

390
00:26:19.273 --> 00:26:21.710
Ew. Layla!
That is so gross!

391
00:26:21.841 --> 00:26:24.626
-He might.
-Oh!

392
00:26:27.977 --> 00:26:30.501
Not bad for a biology dropout.

393
00:26:35.898 --> 00:26:37.944
Ooh! Oh. this is cool.

394
00:26:38.074 --> 00:26:39.685
Looks like some kind of diary.

395
00:26:39.815 --> 00:26:42.644
It needs a key though.

396
00:26:42.731 --> 00:26:43.863
The keys!

397
00:26:51.827 --> 00:26:53.655
Try one of these.

398
00:26:53.786 --> 00:26:55.875
Okay. I think I know
which one it is.

399
00:27:05.275 --> 00:27:08.061
-Let's see.
-Uh. I don't know.

400
00:27:08.148 --> 00:27:09.497
Oh. come on. it's okay.

401
00:27:13.414 --> 00:27:15.503
Oh. look:
"I came back early

402
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:18.549
to find Paul and Kaycee
lounging on the couch.

403
00:27:18.637 --> 00:27:21.814
Paul seemed to move further away
from her when she saw me.

404
00:27:21.944 --> 00:27:25.252
I don't think anything was
going on. but it was still odd.

405
00:27:25.382 --> 00:27:26.862
Kaycee's just so young.

406
00:27:26.993 --> 00:27:29.822
and I don't think Paul
would ever cheat on me."

407
00:27:31.388 --> 00:27:33.086
Okay. we can't.
this is my aunt's.

408
00:27:33.173 --> 00:27:34.217
Oh. come on.

409
00:27:34.304 --> 00:27:36.219
It's okay. come on.
just one more.

410
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:37.612
Just read it.

411
00:27:40.528 --> 00:27:43.357
"I asked Paul if he wanted
to go to the movies tonight.

412
00:27:43.444 --> 00:27:46.273
and he said no again.

413
00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:50.320
He just hasn't been the same
since Kaycee left."

414
00:27:52.409 --> 00:27:53.933
Hmm.

415
00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:55.978
Okay. that's enough.

416
00:27:56.109 --> 00:27:57.153
You're lame!

417
00:27:57.284 --> 00:27:59.068
I wonder who Kaycee is.

418
00:28:08.382 --> 00:28:10.645
Maybe her?

419
00:28:10.776 --> 00:28:13.735
Maybe.

420
00:28:16.477 --> 00:28:18.392
Tell me how it goes with Kevin!

421
00:28:18.479 --> 00:28:19.523
Stop!

422
00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:20.786
See you later.

423
00:28:20.916 --> 00:28:22.526
Hope I don't get lost.

424
00:28:22.613 --> 00:28:24.093
Drive safe.

425
00:28:25.965 --> 00:28:28.054
Bye. girl! Bye!

426
00:28:43.069 --> 00:28:44.157
Kevin?

427
00:30:18.555 --> 00:30:19.643
Answer.

428
00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:24.083
Hello?

429
00:30:24.213 --> 00:30:25.562
Paul. thank God.

430
00:30:25.693 --> 00:30:27.260
Maddie. what's wrong?

431
00:30:27.347 --> 00:30:30.089
I-I-I was just taking a bath.
and. I don't know.

432
00:30:30.176 --> 00:30:32.439
blood just started coming
out of the faucet.

433
00:30:32.569 --> 00:30:34.223
Blood? Are you sure?

434
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:36.965
Yes! I think I know blood
when I see it!

435
00:30:37.052 --> 00:30:39.185
Why would blood be in the pipes?

436
00:30:39.272 --> 00:30:41.665
You sure you're not
on your period. Maddie?

437
00:30:45.017 --> 00:30:46.235
No!

438
00:30:46.366 --> 00:30:48.020
Can't you just come
figure it out?

439
00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:50.370
It's 11 o'clock
at night. Maddie.

440
00:30:50.457 --> 00:30:52.198
Paul. please!

441
00:30:52.328 --> 00:30:55.505
Aunt Grace said. if I need
anything. to just call you.

442
00:30:55.592 --> 00:30:58.160
Maddie. why don't you
just clean yourself off.

443
00:30:58.247 --> 00:31:00.075
and I'll come over
in the morning.

444
00:31:00.206 --> 00:31:01.424
Good night. Maddie.

445
00:31:26.406 --> 00:31:28.625
So. what was it?

446
00:31:28.756 --> 00:31:31.585
Oh. the darnedest thing.

447
00:31:31.715 --> 00:31:34.022
I don't know how it happened.
but some animals

448
00:31:34.153 --> 00:31:36.285
must've gotten
into the septic tank.

449
00:31:36.416 --> 00:31:38.070
Some animals?

450
00:31:38.157 --> 00:31:41.160
I was taking a bath
in animal blood?

451
00:31:41.247 --> 00:31:44.250
Yeah. there was fur
all over the place. too.

452
00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:47.818
Oh. um. yeah. I found this.

453
00:31:49.298 --> 00:31:51.039
Jazzy?

454
00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:53.694
Yeah. I did the best I could
to clean it all up.

455
00:31:53.781 --> 00:31:55.609
but. uh. you know.
if I were you.

456
00:31:55.739 --> 00:31:58.786
I'd let the water run a bit
and cycle through.

457
00:31:58.873 --> 00:32:01.397
Thanks. Paul. I...

458
00:32:01.484 --> 00:32:04.226
I'm sorry I called you so late.

459
00:32:04.313 --> 00:32:07.838
I-I just saw the blood.
and I freaked out.

460
00:32:09.797 --> 00:32:11.233
It's all right.

461
00:32:59.978 --> 00:33:02.806
Did you get lost in there?
It's been like forever.

462
00:33:02.893 --> 00:33:05.722
I was just cleaning up.

463
00:33:05.809 --> 00:33:08.247
Do you know who this is
in the photo?

464
00:33:11.815 --> 00:33:13.992
Yeah. that's Kaycee.

465
00:33:14.079 --> 00:33:15.515
Kaycee?

466
00:33:15.602 --> 00:33:18.474
Who's she?

467
00:33:18.561 --> 00:33:22.522
She's a model that Aunt Grace
used in all of her photo shoots.

468
00:33:22.609 --> 00:33:24.959
She was from New Orleans.

469
00:33:25.046 --> 00:33:27.614
Where is she now?

470
00:33:27.701 --> 00:33:29.355
I don't know.

471
00:33:32.053 --> 00:33:34.795
Do you. uh. you need
anything else?

472
00:33:34.882 --> 00:33:36.666
No. that's it.

473
00:34:18.795 --> 00:34:20.188
Lonely already?

474
00:34:20.275 --> 00:34:22.842
Come in.

475
00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:24.757
I didn't just walk in this time.

476
00:34:24.844 --> 00:34:27.369
No. but you did scare me a bit.

477
00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.850
Well. what do you think?
I've got pizza. wine.

478
00:34:29.937 --> 00:34:31.634
You wanna pop on the big game?

479
00:34:31.721 --> 00:34:33.418
Pizza. yes.

480
00:34:33.505 --> 00:34:35.812
Wine. hell yes.

481
00:34:35.943 --> 00:34:37.118
But the game?

482
00:34:37.205 --> 00:34:38.772
I don't have a TV.

483
00:34:38.859 --> 00:34:42.123
Oh. right. I forgot
you don't have a TV here.

484
00:34:42.254 --> 00:34:43.777
Well. we can just go back
to my place.

485
00:34:43.907 --> 00:34:45.344
I've got an antenna.

486
00:34:45.474 --> 00:34:50.914
Or...maybe we can just enjoy
each other's company?

487
00:34:51.001 --> 00:34:54.092
Okay. but you have
to randomly throw

488
00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:56.268
the word "football" in
every few sentences.

489
00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:00.228
Okay. deal.

490
00:35:05.886 --> 00:35:07.975
Um. I'll go open the wine.

491
00:35:08.062 --> 00:35:09.977
-You can sit.
-Oh. thank you.

492
00:35:25.166 --> 00:35:27.647
Yeah. so. my mom and Grace

493
00:35:27.734 --> 00:35:29.431
never really got along.

494
00:35:29.518 --> 00:35:33.392
I think she always resented
that Grace was so carefree.

495
00:35:33.479 --> 00:35:36.046
and she didn't want her
to influence me.

496
00:35:36.134 --> 00:35:38.005
Well. that kinda backfired.
didn't it?

497
00:35:39.137 --> 00:35:40.921
What about your dad?

498
00:35:41.008 --> 00:35:42.662
He...

499
00:35:42.749 --> 00:35:44.620
ran off when I was two.

500
00:35:44.707 --> 00:35:47.406
No idea where he's at.

501
00:35:47.536 --> 00:35:50.931
Anyway. I tried to follow
in my mom's footsteps

502
00:35:51.018 --> 00:35:54.456
and become a nurse.
but have you ever taken courses

503
00:35:54.543 --> 00:35:57.938
like microbiology
or physiology?

504
00:35:58.025 --> 00:35:59.983
Um. not in the last few hours.

505
00:36:01.246 --> 00:36:03.073
Well. they're super hard.

506
00:36:04.988 --> 00:36:11.038
So. when my mom
passed away last year.

507
00:36:11.125 --> 00:36:12.909
I realized that...

508
00:36:12.996 --> 00:36:14.955
I was just doing it for her.

509
00:36:15.085 --> 00:36:19.525
and it was never really for me.

510
00:36:19.612 --> 00:36:22.397
Photography is my passion.

511
00:36:22.528 --> 00:36:24.007
Just like your aunt.

512
00:36:24.138 --> 00:36:27.097
except she's not training to be
a paparazzi photographer

513
00:36:27.228 --> 00:36:28.360
like you.

514
00:36:28.447 --> 00:36:30.013
That was one photo!

515
00:36:31.363 --> 00:36:32.886
What'd you do with it.
by the way?

516
00:36:32.973 --> 00:36:34.714
Oh. it's definitely going
on my Christmas card.

517
00:36:34.844 --> 00:36:36.150
So. thank you. yeah.

518
00:36:36.237 --> 00:36:38.239
-I'll take a better one.
-Okay.

519
00:36:44.376 --> 00:36:47.596
So. um. how's Paul?

520
00:36:47.683 --> 00:36:49.685
Fine.

521
00:36:49.816 --> 00:36:51.948
-Why?
-Oh. just asking.

522
00:36:52.035 --> 00:36:53.863
I mean. I just see his truck

523
00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:57.127
outside your place
a couple times.

524
00:36:57.215 --> 00:36:58.955
You don't like him. do you?

525
00:36:59.042 --> 00:37:00.261
Why do you say that?

526
00:37:00.348 --> 00:37:01.523
I saw the way

527
00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:04.744
you were looking at him
when I first came.

528
00:37:04.831 --> 00:37:07.616
Paul was always a nice guy.
until...

529
00:37:07.703 --> 00:37:09.531
Until what?

530
00:37:09.618 --> 00:37:12.186
He just. uh. changed.

531
00:37:12.273 --> 00:37:14.101
When?

532
00:37:14.232 --> 00:37:16.756
Him and your aunt
used to rent out the spare room

533
00:37:16.843 --> 00:37:19.149
to really anybody who needs it.

534
00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:22.457
and then all of a sudden.
they just stopped.

535
00:37:22.588 --> 00:37:25.634
After...Kaycee left?

536
00:37:25.765 --> 00:37:27.332
Yeah.

537
00:37:27.419 --> 00:37:29.203
Wait. how do you know that?

538
00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:30.813
Uh. I. um.

539
00:37:30.944 --> 00:37:35.296
I saw her photos
in my aunt's portfolio.

540
00:37:35.383 --> 00:37:37.255
Right.

541
00:37:37.342 --> 00:37:38.995
Did you know her?

542
00:37:39.126 --> 00:37:40.214
Yeah.

543
00:37:40.345 --> 00:37:43.173
Uh. kinda. I mean. I...

544
00:37:43.304 --> 00:37:44.827
I met her like once or twice.

545
00:37:44.958 --> 00:37:48.570
I don't know what happened
to her. um...

546
00:37:48.657 --> 00:37:51.312
Sorry. what was you--
what were you asking about?

547
00:37:51.443 --> 00:37:53.227
Oh. Paul. right. um.

548
00:37:53.314 --> 00:37:55.011
we really haven't said anything
to each other

549
00:37:55.098 --> 00:37:58.101
since we had a bit
of a...disagreement.

550
00:37:58.188 --> 00:37:59.581
About what?

551
00:38:03.542 --> 00:38:05.152
I don't remember.

552
00:38:08.416 --> 00:38:11.463
Yeah. Paul's definitely
something else.

553
00:38:11.593 --> 00:38:13.639
I still don't know
what to make of him.

554
00:38:13.726 --> 00:38:16.859
Oh. and that blood in
the bath tub I told you about.

555
00:38:16.946 --> 00:38:19.253
he said it came
from dead animals

556
00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:22.256
in my septic tank or whatever.

557
00:38:22.343 --> 00:38:24.519
What? Wait. wait. wait.
could that have been Ja--

558
00:38:24.606 --> 00:38:26.216
Oh. no.

559
00:38:26.347 --> 00:38:29.394
It wasn't a cat. it was. uh...

560
00:38:29.524 --> 00:38:30.917
raccoons.

561
00:38:31.004 --> 00:38:34.007
Oh. okay. okay.

562
00:38:34.094 --> 00:38:36.270
But wait.
in the septic tank though?

563
00:38:36.357 --> 00:38:38.141
I don't think that's possible.

564
00:38:38.272 --> 00:38:40.318
That's--that's what he said.

565
00:38:42.972 --> 00:38:45.584
Hey. you okay. Maddie?

566
00:38:45.671 --> 00:38:46.585
Yeah.

567
00:38:47.673 --> 00:38:48.848
Sorry.

568
00:38:48.978 --> 00:38:49.979
Football.

569
00:39:26.494 --> 00:39:27.800
Where'd you get that iPod?

570
00:39:30.019 --> 00:39:31.325
In the drawer

571
00:39:31.412 --> 00:39:33.849
in the guest bedroom.

572
00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:36.635
There's some really cool music
on it.

573
00:39:38.985 --> 00:39:41.814
-What's wrong?
-Uh...

574
00:39:41.944 --> 00:39:44.556
I should just be going. um...

575
00:39:44.686 --> 00:39:47.472
Wait. is everything okay?

576
00:39:47.602 --> 00:39:48.647
Yeah.

577
00:39:48.734 --> 00:39:51.127
Yeah. no. it's--it's...fine.

578
00:39:51.258 --> 00:39:53.260
I just. um...

579
00:39:53.347 --> 00:39:56.306
It's been a while.

580
00:39:56.394 --> 00:39:57.699
Yeah.

581
00:39:59.048 --> 00:40:01.529
But I'll. uh.
see you tomorrow. yeah?

582
00:42:02.563 --> 00:42:03.869
Paul?

583
00:42:05.087 --> 00:42:06.567
Are you in there?

584
00:42:08.743 --> 00:42:10.005
Oh my God!

585
00:42:10.092 --> 00:42:12.007
What are you doing?
You're naked!

586
00:42:12.094 --> 00:42:13.879
I was out and about.
it got late.

587
00:42:14.009 --> 00:42:15.445
so I just thought
I'd crash here.

588
00:42:15.576 --> 00:42:17.056
You can't do that!

589
00:42:17.186 --> 00:42:18.318
I was quiet.

590
00:42:18.405 --> 00:42:20.146
Did you hear me come in?

591
00:42:20.233 --> 00:42:22.670
No. but you just can't freely
come in and out

592
00:42:22.757 --> 00:42:25.499
as you please.
even if it's your house!

593
00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:27.022
Well. your Aunt Grace told me

594
00:42:27.153 --> 00:42:28.850
she wanted me to check in
on you. so...

595
00:42:28.937 --> 00:42:30.504
No. I don't need you to!

596
00:42:30.591 --> 00:42:32.854
I'm fine. I'm really.
really. really fine!

597
00:42:32.985 --> 00:42:34.813
Jeez. you're naked. Paul!

598
00:42:34.943 --> 00:42:36.858
Can't you just leave?

599
00:43:21.163 --> 00:43:22.469
What do you want?

600
00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:23.862
I just...

601
00:43:23.992 --> 00:43:25.907
I want you to be cool
with Maddie is all.

602
00:43:25.994 --> 00:43:27.213
Why do you care?

603
00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:28.867
You know why.

604
00:43:28.954 --> 00:43:31.391
When are you gonna get it
through your thick skull?

605
00:43:31.478 --> 00:43:33.611
I had nothing to do
with Kaycee leaving.

606
00:43:33.698 --> 00:43:35.482
When I get answers. Paul.

607
00:43:45.057 --> 00:43:47.799
-Naked?
-Yes. and...

608
00:43:47.886 --> 00:43:51.106
I'm pretty sure he may have been
in my room last night.

609
00:43:51.193 --> 00:43:54.196
You need to call
and tell your aunt about him.

610
00:43:54.283 --> 00:43:57.243
I have. but her phone
keeps going to voicemail.

611
00:43:57.330 --> 00:43:58.766
What about a hotel or...

612
00:43:58.853 --> 00:44:00.115
A hotel?

613
00:44:00.202 --> 00:44:02.683
I have $50 to my name.

614
00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:04.032
You could stay with Kevin.

615
00:44:04.119 --> 00:44:06.165
I told Aunt Grace
I would take care of the house.

616
00:44:06.295 --> 00:44:07.557
I can't just leave.

617
00:44:07.645 --> 00:44:09.385
-So then...
-I mean. I told Paul

618
00:44:09.516 --> 00:44:10.996
to never come back here.

619
00:44:11.083 --> 00:44:13.912
I...I guess we'll just have
to see what happens now.

620
00:44:13.999 --> 00:44:16.871
-You think he's going to listen?
-Do I have a choice?

621
00:44:44.029 --> 00:44:45.291
Hey. Kevin!

622
00:44:48.598 --> 00:44:51.253
-Hey!
-Hey.

623
00:44:51.384 --> 00:44:54.561
-What are you doing?
-I'm just snapping some photos.

624
00:44:54.648 --> 00:44:56.737
Oh. nice.

625
00:44:56.868 --> 00:44:59.348
I had a really great time
last night.

626
00:44:59.435 --> 00:45:02.090
Me too.

627
00:45:02.177 --> 00:45:05.398
I'm sorry that I had
to bolt out of there.

628
00:45:05.485 --> 00:45:07.966
-I just...
-It's okay.

629
00:45:08.096 --> 00:45:11.709
Um...I...

630
00:45:11.796 --> 00:45:14.755
I have to come clean
about something.

631
00:45:14.886 --> 00:45:18.193
It wasn't just raccoons
found in the septic tank.

632
00:45:18.324 --> 00:45:22.241
It was your cat too. Jazzy.

633
00:45:22.371 --> 00:45:25.157
-What?
-I am so sorry.

634
00:45:25.244 --> 00:45:29.161
I just didn't want
to see you get upset.

635
00:45:29.248 --> 00:45:32.468
I appreciate that. um...

636
00:45:32.599 --> 00:45:34.819
How do you know it was Jazzy?

637
00:45:41.956 --> 00:45:44.742
Paul said there was fur
all over the place.

638
00:45:46.265 --> 00:45:47.570
In the septic tank?

639
00:45:49.485 --> 00:45:51.096
You know what a septic tank is.
right?

640
00:45:51.226 --> 00:45:52.793
No.

641
00:45:52.924 --> 00:45:54.447
Sorry. why?

642
00:45:56.144 --> 00:45:57.667
Just doesn't make sense.

643
00:45:57.755 --> 00:45:59.582
Why would he lie about that?

644
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:03.325
I've gotta go.

645
00:46:03.412 --> 00:46:04.979
Are you sure?

646
00:46:05.066 --> 00:46:08.330
If you wanna talk.
or get your mind off things.

647
00:46:08.417 --> 00:46:10.028
you can always stay.

648
00:46:10.115 --> 00:46:13.031
This time it was
just a cat. Maddie.

649
00:46:13.118 --> 00:46:14.554
What does that mean?

650
00:46:14.684 --> 00:46:16.208
Nothing.

651
00:46:16.338 --> 00:46:18.558
No. I--I meant. it's--

652
00:46:18.645 --> 00:46:20.821
Hey. I'll see you later. okay?

653
00:48:46.619 --> 00:48:47.794
Hello?

654
00:48:49.927 --> 00:48:51.754
Hello? I'm in here!

655
00:48:51.841 --> 00:48:53.234
Maddie?

656
00:48:54.453 --> 00:48:55.933
I'm in the bathroom!

657
00:49:03.897 --> 00:49:06.073
The AC was on full blast.

658
00:49:06.204 --> 00:49:08.771
What? I keep cranking
that thing up.

659
00:49:08.858 --> 00:49:11.644
It has a mind of its own.

660
00:49:11.774 --> 00:49:15.691
Anyways. thanks
for opening the door.

661
00:49:15.822 --> 00:49:17.780
It's a good thing I came over.

662
00:49:17.867 --> 00:49:20.174
You know. I brought some wings.

663
00:49:20.305 --> 00:49:22.350
Thanks.

664
00:49:24.962 --> 00:49:27.007
Um...

665
00:49:27.094 --> 00:49:28.922
Will you...

666
00:49:29.009 --> 00:49:31.185
stay with me tonight?

667
00:49:31.272 --> 00:49:33.318
I'm not really feeling
safe here.

668
00:49:35.842 --> 00:49:37.800
Uh. sure.

669
00:49:48.376 --> 00:49:49.464
Thanks.

670
00:50:03.522 --> 00:50:05.132
Will you get the light?

671
00:50:05.219 --> 00:50:07.569
Oh. yeah. of course.

672
00:50:42.256 --> 00:50:43.736
Kevin?

673
00:50:51.048 --> 00:50:52.701
Are you still here?

674
00:50:57.010 --> 00:51:00.057
Hey. it's just me.

675
00:51:00.187 --> 00:51:01.449
Come here.

676
00:51:02.929 --> 00:51:04.235
How do you feel?

677
00:51:05.671 --> 00:51:08.195
Better. but...where did you go?

678
00:51:08.282 --> 00:51:10.154
I just couldn't get comfortable.

679
00:51:10.241 --> 00:51:12.678
I mean. that room...

680
00:51:12.808 --> 00:51:15.159
The bed is just really small.

681
00:51:15.246 --> 00:51:18.118
You wanna come up to my place?
I've got a queen.

682
00:51:18.249 --> 00:51:20.903
Or we can just try to get
into the master bedroom.

683
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:22.688
There's a queen in there.

684
00:51:22.818 --> 00:51:24.559
What do you think?

685
00:51:27.345 --> 00:51:29.086
It's just an idea.

686
00:51:30.783 --> 00:51:33.612
Yeah. let's do it.

687
00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:38.356
I found a set of keys.
but none of them worked.

688
00:51:38.486 --> 00:51:41.272
Well. let me have a go at it.

689
00:52:28.493 --> 00:52:31.626
I haven't slept that good
in a while.

690
00:52:31.713 --> 00:52:33.846
You know. I think I'm gonna
start staying in here

691
00:52:33.933 --> 00:52:34.934
from now on.

692
00:52:35.021 --> 00:52:36.979
I don't care what Paul thinks.

693
00:52:37.066 --> 00:52:39.286
That sounds like a plan.

694
00:52:54.258 --> 00:52:56.303
What are you lookin' for?

695
00:52:56.434 --> 00:52:59.480
I have no idea.

696
00:52:59.567 --> 00:53:01.830
but Paul comes in here a lot.

697
00:53:17.498 --> 00:53:19.108
Find anything?

698
00:53:19.196 --> 00:53:21.154
No. I mean.

699
00:53:21.241 --> 00:53:25.114
everything seems normal enough.

700
00:53:25.202 --> 00:53:27.334
But why lock the door?

701
00:53:27.421 --> 00:53:29.293
Why not just put a sign on it?

702
00:53:29.423 --> 00:53:30.946
Would a sign have stopped you?

703
00:53:31.033 --> 00:53:32.513
I mean. a lock didn't.

704
00:53:34.689 --> 00:53:35.908
You're right.

705
00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:51.706
Stop!

706
00:53:56.624 --> 00:53:58.670
-What?
-Oh my God.

707
00:54:01.107 --> 00:54:03.065
What happened?

708
00:54:04.763 --> 00:54:06.591
Did you leave the door open
last night?

709
00:54:06.678 --> 00:54:07.679
No!

710
00:54:07.809 --> 00:54:10.508
No. I don't think so.

711
00:54:13.641 --> 00:54:16.514
Oh no.

712
00:54:16.644 --> 00:54:18.429
Maddie. I am so sorry.

713
00:54:20.996 --> 00:54:22.955
Do you think animals
could have done this?

714
00:54:23.085 --> 00:54:24.565
Honestly?

715
00:54:24.652 --> 00:54:27.307
I don't know.

716
00:54:27.394 --> 00:54:29.918
I mean. this is the chicken
I left over last night.

717
00:54:30.005 --> 00:54:32.747
If it was animals. they would've
gotten to this. right?

718
00:54:34.314 --> 00:54:35.924
Oh my God.

719
00:54:42.757 --> 00:54:44.281
That's weird.

720
00:54:44.411 --> 00:54:47.153
Only your photos are ripped up
and none of your aunt's.

721
00:54:49.982 --> 00:54:51.375
You're right.

722
00:54:53.246 --> 00:54:55.988
I think this was Paul.

723
00:54:56.075 --> 00:54:59.252
Why would he trash his own place
and my photos?

724
00:54:59.339 --> 00:55:00.862
And a lot of your clothes.

725
00:55:02.124 --> 00:55:04.126
He's trying to run you out.

726
00:55:04.213 --> 00:55:06.564
-Why? I didn't do anything.
-Just think about it.

727
00:55:06.694 --> 00:55:08.435
I mean. your crushed cell phone.

728
00:55:08.566 --> 00:55:10.655
Jazzy in the septic tank.

729
00:55:10.742 --> 00:55:11.960
the bathroom door knob.

730
00:55:12.047 --> 00:55:14.398
the thermostat
that has a mind of its own.

731
00:55:14.528 --> 00:55:16.922
and now this?

732
00:55:17.009 --> 00:55:19.968
Look. just for now.
why don't you come stay with me?

733
00:55:20.055 --> 00:55:21.796
A little too soon. Kevin.

734
00:55:21.927 --> 00:55:24.756
Okay. I don't mean it like that.

735
00:55:24.843 --> 00:55:28.194
I just mean...to stay safe.

736
00:55:28.281 --> 00:55:29.587
No.

737
00:55:29.717 --> 00:55:31.980
I'm not gonna let him beat me.

738
00:55:34.331 --> 00:55:35.941
I'm gonna catch him.

739
00:55:40.206 --> 00:55:41.903
Come on.

740
00:55:42.034 --> 00:55:43.688
Oh. okay.

741
00:55:49.258 --> 00:55:52.436
Okay. so. I'm gonna set it
on a time lapse.

742
00:55:52.566 --> 00:55:54.873
Aunt Grace used to do this
on our family holidays

743
00:55:55.003 --> 00:55:57.049
when I was little.
and you can see the decorations

744
00:55:57.179 --> 00:56:00.400
going up and the lights
flickering on and off.

745
00:56:00.531 --> 00:56:02.010
You wanna capture us

746
00:56:02.097 --> 00:56:05.100
cleaning up this mess
to test it?

747
00:56:05.187 --> 00:56:06.406
Yeah.

748
00:57:02.419 --> 00:57:04.333
Hi! Oh my gosh!

749
00:57:04.464 --> 00:57:05.726
I love the hair!

750
00:57:05.813 --> 00:57:06.858
Thank you!

751
00:57:06.988 --> 00:57:08.860
Let's get you some wine. girl.

752
00:57:11.253 --> 00:57:13.081
Oh. here's something.

753
00:57:13.168 --> 00:57:15.562
"They make such a cute couple.

754
00:57:15.693 --> 00:57:17.259
It almost feels like kismet

755
00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:19.305
that I was able
to bring them together."

756
00:57:19.392 --> 00:57:20.524
Who's they?

757
00:57:20.611 --> 00:57:22.221
She wouldn't have said that
about Paul.

758
00:57:22.308 --> 00:57:23.962
Ew. Keep reading.

759
00:57:24.092 --> 00:57:26.573
There has to be more juice
in there somewhere.

760
00:57:26.660 --> 00:57:28.836
I mean. most of it is
about her photography.

761
00:57:28.923 --> 00:57:30.838
people she meets. travels.

762
00:57:30.925 --> 00:57:32.536
Did you know
she's been to Japan?

763
00:57:32.623 --> 00:57:34.189
Mm-mm.

764
00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:36.540
Oh wait. I found something else.

765
00:57:36.627 --> 00:57:39.325
"Kevin came over
to confront Paul today.

766
00:57:39.456 --> 00:57:41.022
For whatever reason.
Kevin thinks Paul

767
00:57:41.153 --> 00:57:42.720
had something to do
with Kaycee leaving.

768
00:57:42.807 --> 00:57:46.375
like scaring her...
or even hurting her.

769
00:57:46.506 --> 00:57:48.029
I don't believe that.

770
00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:50.336
I do think it's strange that
she would just up and leave.

771
00:57:50.423 --> 00:57:53.121
but people are funny that way.
and when Kaycee first arrived.

772
00:57:53.208 --> 00:57:55.820
it always felt like
she was just passing through."

773
00:58:00.215 --> 00:58:01.826
Kevin and Kaycee.

774
00:58:05.917 --> 00:58:08.006
They used to be a couple.

775
00:58:10.922 --> 00:58:12.880
Not Paul and Kaycee?

776
00:58:12.967 --> 00:58:14.447
I don't know.

777
00:58:14.534 --> 00:58:17.102
Maybe they had an affair too?

778
00:58:17.189 --> 00:58:19.931
That would explain why Kevin
might've felt a certain way.

779
00:58:20.018 --> 00:58:22.281
if he had known.

780
00:58:22.368 --> 00:58:24.588
Maybe that's why Kaycee left.

781
00:58:24.675 --> 00:58:26.328
I mean. judging
from all these entries.

782
00:58:26.415 --> 00:58:27.808
that's almost a year ago.

783
00:58:41.126 --> 00:58:43.258
Oh. I found something else.

784
00:58:43.389 --> 00:58:44.608
"New Orleans.

785
00:58:44.695 --> 00:58:46.523
That's where Kaycee said
she's from.

786
00:58:46.610 --> 00:58:48.437
She's turning out to be
my favorite model.

787
00:58:48.568 --> 00:58:50.222
She's so full of life.

788
00:58:50.309 --> 00:58:52.267
I know Paul has
a little crush on her.

789
00:58:52.354 --> 00:58:54.052
I mean. who wouldn't?

790
00:58:54.139 --> 00:58:56.054
They have
the New Orleans connection.

791
00:58:56.184 --> 00:58:58.709
It's all harmless though."

792
00:58:58.796 --> 00:59:01.363
Okay. we gotta figure this out.

793
00:59:16.988 --> 00:59:18.555
Hello. Kaycee.

794
00:59:51.936 --> 00:59:54.373
Paul. this is Kaycee Irwin.

795
00:59:58.029 --> 00:59:59.900
She's gonna be renting
the guest room.

796
01:00:03.425 --> 01:00:05.427
Oh. that's good.

797
01:00:05.558 --> 01:00:07.255
Uh. where you from. Kaycee?

798
01:00:07.342 --> 01:00:08.909
New Orleans.

799
01:00:08.996 --> 01:00:10.302
I grew up there.

800
01:00:10.432 --> 01:00:13.000
Yeah. I love the music.
love the food.

801
01:00:13.131 --> 01:00:15.568
We're gonna have to cook you up
something spicy.

802
01:00:15.655 --> 01:00:18.049
-Oh. yes.
-That would be amazing.

803
01:00:18.136 --> 01:00:20.268
Have a seat.

804
01:00:20.399 --> 01:00:23.750
So. um. we don't have Wi-Fi.

805
01:00:23.881 --> 01:00:26.231
and it's an old house. so...

806
01:00:36.197 --> 01:00:38.765
Beautiful. okay.
hold it right there.

807
01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:44.858
Oh. that's gorgeous.
hold it there.

808
01:00:44.989 --> 01:00:46.468
Lift the flowers up
a little bit.

809
01:00:48.906 --> 01:00:50.081
Hey. Paul!

810
01:00:51.865 --> 01:00:53.388
You like my wig?

811
01:00:53.475 --> 01:00:55.434
Yeah. it's really cute.

812
01:00:55.521 --> 01:00:57.262
What are you doing down here?

813
01:00:57.392 --> 01:00:58.829
Oh. I just thought
I'd get some fresh air.

814
01:00:58.916 --> 01:01:00.482
come down and see
how the session's going.

815
01:01:00.569 --> 01:01:02.571
You never visit my sessions.

816
01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:04.399
That's 'cause you're
usually taking pictures

817
01:01:04.486 --> 01:01:06.140
of ugly people like me.

818
01:01:06.227 --> 01:01:10.144
Oh. Paul. you're far from ugly.

819
01:01:10.275 --> 01:01:11.885
Oh. that's beautiful.
right there. hold it.

820
01:01:11.972 --> 01:01:13.017
One. two. three.

821
01:01:31.035 --> 01:01:32.601
Hey. I'm s--I'm sorry.

822
01:01:32.732 --> 01:01:33.820
-Oh.
-Sorry.

823
01:01:33.951 --> 01:01:35.039
didn't mean to bother you.

824
01:01:35.126 --> 01:01:36.170
I'm Kevin.

825
01:01:36.257 --> 01:01:38.390
I live in that house over there.

826
01:01:38.477 --> 01:01:40.000
I'm Kaycee.

827
01:01:40.087 --> 01:01:41.480
It's a pleasure
to meet you. Kaycee.

828
01:01:41.610 --> 01:01:42.742
You just moved in?

829
01:01:42.873 --> 01:01:44.439
I did. yeah.

830
01:01:44.570 --> 01:01:45.702
Welcome to the neighborhood.

831
01:01:45.832 --> 01:01:47.355
How long are you
gonna be staying here?

832
01:01:47.442 --> 01:01:49.836
No idea. just...

833
01:01:49.967 --> 01:01:51.316
I like it here.

834
01:01:58.366 --> 01:02:00.760
I love you.

835
01:02:00.847 --> 01:02:03.458
You know that.

836
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:05.025
Right?

837
01:02:07.158 --> 01:02:09.813
I had a whole plan for us.

838
01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:16.776
What are you doing?

839
01:02:16.907 --> 01:02:17.821
Kaycee.

840
01:02:17.951 --> 01:02:19.387
Get out!

841
01:02:19.474 --> 01:02:20.911
Oh my God!

842
01:02:24.392 --> 01:02:26.394
Yeah. I'm almost done.

843
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:31.660
You got a kitten?

844
01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:35.447
You named him Jazzy?
I love that. that's so cute!

845
01:02:35.577 --> 01:02:37.144
Yeah. I will be right there.

846
01:02:37.275 --> 01:02:40.104
I just have to tell
Paul and Grace.

847
01:02:40.191 --> 01:02:42.671
Okay. bye.

848
01:02:43.847 --> 01:02:45.674
Tell Paul and Grace what?

849
01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:47.067
Was--was that Kevin?

850
01:02:47.154 --> 01:02:50.375
Oh. hey. yeah. um.
I'm moving in with him.

851
01:02:50.462 --> 01:02:53.204
We're in love.

852
01:02:53.291 --> 01:02:55.902
But I'm the one
who's in love with you.

853
01:02:56.033 --> 01:02:59.427
I'm...flattered. seriously.

854
01:02:59.514 --> 01:03:01.603
but. you know. you're married.

855
01:03:01.734 --> 01:03:05.042
Oh. no. no. no. that's been over
for a long time now. yeah.

856
01:03:05.129 --> 01:03:07.131
Uh. yeah. that doesn't matter.

857
01:03:07.261 --> 01:03:10.656
Uh. you just need
to give us a chance.

858
01:03:10.743 --> 01:03:14.094
I'm...I'm so sorry.

859
01:03:14.181 --> 01:03:15.835
Hey. no. no. no. stay here.

860
01:03:15.966 --> 01:03:17.532
Stay here.
just stay here with me.

861
01:03:17.663 --> 01:03:18.969
Let go!

862
01:03:19.099 --> 01:03:20.448
No. no. no. please. please!

863
01:03:20.535 --> 01:03:21.972
I need you here with me. please.

864
01:03:22.102 --> 01:03:24.148
I don't love you!

865
01:03:24.278 --> 01:03:25.497
Get off!

866
01:03:48.041 --> 01:03:50.565
Look what you made me do.

867
01:04:07.756 --> 01:04:10.934
No one will ever come
between us. Kaycee.

868
01:04:11.064 --> 01:04:12.326
No one.

869
01:04:14.154 --> 01:04:16.113
I love you. Kaycee.

870
01:04:35.784 --> 01:04:36.785
Hey!

871
01:04:36.916 --> 01:04:39.658
Hey. leave her alone!

872
01:04:39.788 --> 01:04:41.138
What are you talkin' about?

873
01:04:41.268 --> 01:04:43.923
I know exactly
what you're up to.

874
01:04:44.054 --> 01:04:47.057
Her phone. the bathroom door.
all of it.

875
01:04:47.187 --> 01:04:48.841
And you killed Jazzy.
didn't you?

876
01:04:48.928 --> 01:04:51.235
-You. you are sick.
-Jazzy?

877
01:04:51.365 --> 01:04:54.107
Yes. don't pretend
like you don't remember.

878
01:04:54.194 --> 01:04:56.066
Kaycee's cat. Jazzy.

879
01:04:56.153 --> 01:04:58.590
I bought him a real nice rock.
okay. real nice stone.

880
01:04:58.677 --> 01:05:00.984
even had it engraved.
and I had to bury that collar

881
01:05:01.071 --> 01:05:03.334
in the field out back!

882
01:05:03.464 --> 01:05:06.119
Listen. Paul. I don't know
what you're up to.

883
01:05:06.206 --> 01:05:07.816
but you drove Kaycee
to run away.

884
01:05:07.947 --> 01:05:09.688
and now you're trying to do
the same to Maddie.

885
01:05:09.775 --> 01:05:12.517
Okay. Kevin...

886
01:05:12.647 --> 01:05:15.389
you really wanna know
what happened to Kaycee?

887
01:05:33.364 --> 01:05:35.714
So. what are you up to tomorrow?

888
01:05:35.801 --> 01:05:37.977
I don't know. I think I might
just like go on a hike

889
01:05:38.064 --> 01:05:39.239
and clear my head.

890
01:05:39.370 --> 01:05:40.414
Are you sure?

891
01:05:40.545 --> 01:05:42.242
I wouldn't hike out here alone.

892
01:05:42.329 --> 01:05:43.722
I'll be fine.

893
01:05:43.809 --> 01:05:46.246
If Paul tries to creep
or trash his house again.

894
01:05:46.333 --> 01:05:47.813
I'll have proof
to show my aunt.

895
01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:49.162
Okay.

896
01:05:49.249 --> 01:05:50.468
Just be careful.

897
01:05:50.555 --> 01:05:52.644
and you might want to take
that wig off.

898
01:05:53.862 --> 01:05:55.473
You know what. you can have it.

899
01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:58.171
Oh. gee. thanks!

900
01:05:58.258 --> 01:05:59.781
Let's see.

901
01:06:06.571 --> 01:06:07.920
I'll keep looking through this.

902
01:06:08.007 --> 01:06:09.878
see if I find
anything else. okay?

903
01:06:09.966 --> 01:06:11.184
Call me.

904
01:07:01.321 --> 01:07:03.323
I found something else
in the diary.

905
01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:05.282
"Today was the annual
fall festival.

906
01:07:05.369 --> 01:07:07.284
and I baked the perfect
Dutch apple pie.

907
01:07:07.414 --> 01:07:10.504
but I wasted my time
since I never ended up going.

908
01:07:10.635 --> 01:07:13.681
I was visited by my good friend.
psychiatrist Dr. Fernando Avila.

909
01:07:13.768 --> 01:07:15.727
who agreed to meet with Paul
since he seemed to be

910
01:07:15.857 --> 01:07:18.512
in such a depressive mood
ever since Kaycee left.

911
01:07:18.599 --> 01:07:21.037
Fernando said that Paul
was suffering from a combination

912
01:07:21.124 --> 01:07:23.648
of delusional jealousy
and erotomania

913
01:07:23.735 --> 01:07:25.911
where Paul believed that Kaycee

914
01:07:26.042 --> 01:07:28.696
may have had strong feelings
for him in return.

915
01:07:28.827 --> 01:07:30.785
Once she left.
his heart was broken.

916
01:07:30.872 --> 01:07:33.919
and time will only tell
how long it will take to mend.

917
01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:36.095
Paul did apologize to me
for his behavior.

918
01:07:36.182 --> 01:07:38.576
but I'm not sure
I'll ever be able to recover."

919
01:07:38.663 --> 01:07:42.884
I wonder if--if she knows
how crazy he really is.

920
01:07:42.971 --> 01:07:46.192
Oh. I found one more thing.

921
01:07:46.323 --> 01:07:49.543
I was curious. so I looked up
Dr. Fernando Avila.

922
01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:51.719
and the only one that came up

923
01:07:51.806 --> 01:07:55.332
passed away three days
after the journal entry.

924
01:07:55.462 --> 01:07:56.811
Listen to this:

925
01:07:56.942 --> 01:07:59.249
"Investigators say
Dr. Fernando Avila died

926
01:07:59.379 --> 01:08:02.208
from carbon monoxide poisoning
from his gas-powered furnace.

927
01:08:02.339 --> 01:08:04.341
At the time his body was found.

928
01:08:04.428 --> 01:08:07.605
all carbon monoxide detectors
were reportedly unplugged."

929
01:08:07.692 --> 01:08:10.477
Oh. do you think Paul
had something to do with that?

930
01:08:10.564 --> 01:08:11.826
Maybe.

931
01:08:11.957 --> 01:08:13.437
I do think there's
something with Kaycee

932
01:08:13.524 --> 01:08:15.787
that Paul's holding onto.

933
01:08:15.874 --> 01:08:18.790
That's why he won't let
your aunt sell the house.

934
01:08:18.877 --> 01:08:22.488
Maddie. he's hoping
Kaycee returns one day!

935
01:08:24.361 --> 01:08:26.580
Unless...

936
01:08:26.666 --> 01:08:28.365
Unless what?

937
01:08:28.452 --> 01:08:30.715
Unless she's...

938
01:08:30.801 --> 01:08:33.196
Unless she's already there.

939
01:08:33.282 --> 01:08:35.502
What? Layla. like she's dead?

940
01:08:35.633 --> 01:08:36.982
What?

941
01:08:37.112 --> 01:08:39.462
You're really starting
to freak me out.

942
01:08:39.550 --> 01:08:42.595
Just be careful.

943
01:08:42.683 --> 01:08:44.946
I'm gonna keep looking to see
if I find anything else.

944
01:08:45.032 --> 01:08:46.296
You should ask Kevin too.

945
01:08:46.425 --> 01:08:48.254
Okay. I will.

946
01:08:48.341 --> 01:08:50.300
I'm gonna call you. so pick up.

947
01:08:50.387 --> 01:08:51.256
Bye.

948
01:09:30.601 --> 01:09:31.818
Who is it?

949
01:09:38.609 --> 01:09:40.479
Who is it?

950
01:09:40.611 --> 01:09:43.091
Maintenance. there's a leak
in the apartment below you.

951
01:09:43.221 --> 01:09:45.442
I think it's coming
from your bath tub.

952
01:09:46.703 --> 01:09:48.444
Do you guys have normal hours?

953
01:10:04.983 --> 01:10:07.638
Lookie here.

954
01:10:07.725 --> 01:10:10.031
Imagine that. everything...

955
01:10:10.118 --> 01:10:13.469
about me.
right in this little book.

956
01:10:16.473 --> 01:10:19.215
You know. it's hard
to make a marriage work

957
01:10:19.302 --> 01:10:21.173
when there's no
forgive-and-forget.

958
01:10:23.262 --> 01:10:25.699
You know. uh.

959
01:10:25.786 --> 01:10:28.353
people take landlords
for granted.

960
01:10:28.485 --> 01:10:32.358
Yeah. they think they're
just around to fix things.

961
01:10:32.445 --> 01:10:34.055
but do you know
what else they do?

962
01:10:46.111 --> 01:10:47.895
They save lives.

963
01:11:57.356 --> 01:11:58.791
Kevin?

964
01:12:11.501 --> 01:12:13.851
Kevin. it's Maddie.

965
01:12:13.981 --> 01:12:17.115
I brought you some coffee.

966
01:12:17.202 --> 01:12:21.337
I kinda wanted to talk to you
a little about. um...Kaycee.

967
01:12:26.037 --> 01:12:27.647
Are you mad at me?

968
01:12:33.349 --> 01:12:36.047
Hey. listen. I'm gonna go hiking
and take some photos.

969
01:12:44.011 --> 01:12:45.361
Layla?

970
01:12:48.625 --> 01:12:50.103
Come on. Layla.

971
01:12:50.191 --> 01:12:51.758
I'm sure it was you.

972
01:14:28.638 --> 01:14:30.509
Hello?

973
01:14:30.596 --> 01:14:31.902
Oh. hey. hey. Grace.

974
01:14:31.989 --> 01:14:33.338
So great to hear your voice.

975
01:14:33.425 --> 01:14:35.209
Yeah. how's Africa?

976
01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:37.385
What?

977
01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:39.039
Really?

978
01:14:39.170 --> 01:14:41.651
When?

979
01:14:41.737 --> 01:14:44.044
That's. uh. wonderful news.

980
01:14:44.175 --> 01:14:45.916
Yeah.

981
01:14:46.003 --> 01:14:48.657
No. I don't know why Maddie
wouldn't pick up her phone.

982
01:14:48.788 --> 01:14:51.530
Well. maybe she's outside.

983
01:14:51.617 --> 01:14:52.835
Voicemails?

984
01:14:52.923 --> 01:14:54.751
I don't know...

985
01:14:54.838 --> 01:14:57.580
Look. last time I checked on
her. she was just doing great.

986
01:14:57.710 --> 01:14:59.712
Yeah. well. she'll be
excited to see you.

987
01:14:59.843 --> 01:15:00.931
Yeah.

988
01:15:03.629 --> 01:15:05.152
As will I.

989
01:15:40.231 --> 01:15:41.841
Welcome back. Maddie.

990
01:18:18.868 --> 01:18:19.999
Kevin.

991
01:18:20.085 --> 01:18:21.174
Kevin?!

992
01:18:50.421 --> 01:18:52.466
Enough playing games.

993
01:19:30.330 --> 01:19:33.029
Hey. Maddie!
How ya doin'?

994
01:19:34.334 --> 01:19:36.380
I gotta hand it to ya.

995
01:19:36.467 --> 01:19:39.949
you sure made this game fun.

996
01:19:40.036 --> 01:19:41.994
I mean. really.

997
01:19:42.081 --> 01:19:46.477
I really thought
you would've run away by now.

998
01:19:46.564 --> 01:19:50.523
but I guess you got
a pretty high tolerance

999
01:19:50.655 --> 01:19:52.962
because you don't have
to pay rent!

1000
01:19:55.398 --> 01:19:59.969
Oh. looks like you found
good old Kevin!

1001
01:20:00.056 --> 01:20:02.536
I got kinda tired of him.

1002
01:20:02.623 --> 01:20:04.625
He was gettin' on my nerves.

1003
01:20:04.755 --> 01:20:06.410
Yeah. he was always
snoopin' around.

1004
01:20:06.496 --> 01:20:09.456
stickin' his nose
where it shouldn't be.

1005
01:20:09.543 --> 01:20:12.895
kinda like you.

1006
01:20:12.982 --> 01:20:15.636
What's it gonna be. Maddie?

1007
01:20:15.723 --> 01:20:18.901
Carbon monoxide poisoning?

1008
01:20:18.987 --> 01:20:23.469
Maybe a fall
from a high ladder. huh?

1009
01:20:23.557 --> 01:20:25.124
That'd break your neck.

1010
01:20:28.171 --> 01:20:29.737
Stay away from me. Paul!

1011
01:20:29.825 --> 01:20:31.000
What have you done?

1012
01:20:31.087 --> 01:20:32.305
What do you mean?

1013
01:20:32.392 --> 01:20:33.698
Have you hurt Kaycee?

1014
01:20:33.785 --> 01:20:36.962
Kaycee?
What are you talking about?

1015
01:20:37.049 --> 01:20:38.442
Where is she?

1016
01:20:39.573 --> 01:20:41.184
Did you kill her?

1017
01:20:41.271 --> 01:20:42.794
You hurt her. didn't you?

1018
01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:44.404
You hurt her!

1019
01:21:05.512 --> 01:21:07.514
Oh my God. No. Layla.

1020
01:21:39.111 --> 01:21:40.243
Stop!

1021
01:21:42.941 --> 01:21:45.335
-What did you do to Layla?
-That was your fault. Maddie.

1022
01:21:45.422 --> 01:21:47.119
You should've never gotten
her involved.

1023
01:21:47.250 --> 01:21:49.905
And Kaycee was fine
until you started meddling!

1024
01:21:49.992 --> 01:21:51.994
It's always been about Kaycee.
hasn't it?

1025
01:21:52.081 --> 01:21:54.474
Oh. no. I just wanted her here.
where she belongs.

1026
01:21:54.561 --> 01:21:56.389
She was running
from an abusive relationship.

1027
01:21:56.476 --> 01:21:58.217
and I was taking care of her!

1028
01:21:58.304 --> 01:21:59.827
-And what about Kevin?
-Everything was fine

1029
01:21:59.958 --> 01:22:01.394
till he came into the picture.

1030
01:22:01.481 --> 01:22:03.788
He was taking her away from me!

1031
01:22:03.875 --> 01:22:05.702
You need to stop this. Paul!

1032
01:22:05.790 --> 01:22:07.270
And my poor aunt?

1033
01:22:07.357 --> 01:22:09.228
You've been using her
this whole time.

1034
01:22:09.315 --> 01:22:10.577
You need help!

1035
01:22:10.708 --> 01:22:13.276
No. I'm sorry.
I can't let Kaycee go.

1036
01:22:13.362 --> 01:22:15.059
She needs someone
to take care of her.

1037
01:22:15.147 --> 01:22:16.714
She needs someone
who will love her.

1038
01:22:16.844 --> 01:22:18.455
That person can only be me.

1039
01:22:18.541 --> 01:22:19.891
That's for Layla.

1040
01:22:19.978 --> 01:22:20.936
That's for Kevin.

1041
01:22:22.241 --> 01:22:23.939
That's for Kaycee.

1042
01:22:53.577 --> 01:22:56.536
Okay. ma'am. we have units
arriving to the location.

1043
01:22:56.623 --> 01:22:58.930
Just stay in the house.
keep the door locked.

1044
01:22:59.017 --> 01:23:00.540
and stay on the phone.

1045
01:23:00.627 --> 01:23:03.282
Just stay with me.
You're going to be fine.

1046
01:23:03.369 --> 01:23:04.588
Can you hear me?

1047
01:23:04.718 --> 01:23:06.371
-Yeah.
-Okay. stay with us.

1048
01:23:06.503 --> 01:23:09.332
-I'll be right here.
-Just stay on the phone.

1049
01:23:09.462 --> 01:23:11.202
-Thank you.
-You're going to be fine.

1050
01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:30.108
You're free now. Kaycee.

1051
01:24:37.985 --> 01:24:39.248
What's happening?

1052
01:24:39.335 --> 01:24:40.901
Paul. what have you done?

1053
01:24:44.557 --> 01:24:45.906
Maddie.

1054
01:24:46.037 --> 01:24:47.386
Oh my God.

1055
01:24:49.954 --> 01:24:52.609
It's okay.

1056
01:24:52.696 --> 01:24:55.307
-Oh God.
-It's okay.

1057
01:24:55.438 --> 01:24:57.614
I'm fine.

1058
01:24:57.744 --> 01:24:59.442
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

1059
01:25:43.225 --> 01:25:45.966
I didn't think
you were gonna make it.

1060
01:25:46.053 --> 01:25:47.272
I almost didn't.

1061
01:25:47.359 --> 01:25:49.405
I got so nervous.
I almost threw up.

1062
01:25:51.058 --> 01:25:54.323
Listen. no matter
what happens today.

1063
01:25:54.410 --> 01:25:56.847
I really think you should give
college another shot.

1064
01:25:58.501 --> 01:26:00.371
Make your mom happy.

1065
01:26:00.459 --> 01:26:03.245
Actually. I found
a photography school

1066
01:26:03.375 --> 01:26:05.116
that might work.

1067
01:26:05.202 --> 01:26:07.118
I'm really proud of you.

1068
01:26:07.205 --> 01:26:08.684
Thanks. Aunt Grace.

1069
01:26:08.815 --> 01:26:10.556
I love you so much.

1070
01:26:10.643 --> 01:26:11.688
Oh.
