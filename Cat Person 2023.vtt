<i> You will freeze as you

<i>when his bloody scalpel
probes the forbidden secrets</i>

00:00:43.153 --> 00:00:45.068

<i>of a beautiful girl's
last searing dance</i>

8
00:00:50.856 --> 00:00:53.685

her loveliness.</i>

00:00:54.904 --> 00:00:57.254

18
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.887
Um. I'll do a large
popcorn and Red Vines.

19
00:01:22.888 --> 00:01:24.847
That's an unusual choice.

20
00:01:26.718 --> 00:01:27.806
Thank you.

21
00:01:32.115 --> 00:01:35.075
I don't think I've actually
ever seen someone buy Red Vines.

22
00:01:35.162 --> 00:01:36.598
Okay.

23
00:01:40.471 --> 00:01:43.170
I guess you're wondering
why we sell them. then.

24
00:01:43.257 --> 00:01:45.085
if nobody buys them.

25
00:01:49.611 --> 00:01:50.568
Thanks.

Hey. Where are you?

29
00:02:26.561 --> 00:02:27.649
<i>My room. obviously.</i>

30
00:02:27.736 --> 00:02:29.346
Taylor. did you even
go outside today?

31
00:02:29.433 --> 00:02:30.565
<i>Why would I do that?</i>

32
00:02:30.652 --> 00:02:32.175
<i>No. I had to stay here
and moderate.</i>

33
00:02:32.262 --> 00:02:33.829
Which subreddit
is this again?

34
00:02:33.916 --> 00:02:36.266
<i>The Vagenda. Get back here.
Help me with this.</i>

35
00:02:36.353 --> 00:02:38.138
Okay. If I'm not back
in five minutes.

36
00:02:38.225 --> 00:02:39.182
call campus security.

37
00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.618
<i>Haha. Bleak.</i>

38
00:02:41.706 --> 00:02:43.360
<i>Being a girl is so fun. Bye.</i>

39
00:02:43.447 --> 00:02:44.535
Bye.

40
00:03:13.216 --> 00:03:14.522
Hey. boy.

41
00:03:16.306 --> 00:03:17.699
Hey.

42
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:20.571
You all alone?

43
00:03:22.007 --> 00:03:23.748
Okay. okay.

44
00:03:23.835 --> 00:03:25.185
Good boy.

45
00:03:40.504 --> 00:03:42.332
I don't know.

46
00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:43.942
We can try.

47
00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:46.031
But you have to be
so good. okay?

48
00:03:49.383 --> 00:03:50.253
Okay.

49
00:03:57.652 --> 00:03:59.480
What do you think
you're doing?

50
00:04:00.916 --> 00:04:02.961
Oh. hey. Laura.

51
00:04:03.048 --> 00:04:04.528
How's it going?

52
00:04:05.834 --> 00:04:09.098
It's about to start
pouring. so...

53
00:04:09.185 --> 00:04:12.841
So let's just bring
some weird dog into the dorm?

54
00:04:12.928 --> 00:04:15.452
He's not weird.
He's abandoned.

55
00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:17.367
Look. he's. he's not
gonna bother anyone.

56
00:04:17.454 --> 00:04:19.195
You know the rules. Margot.

57
00:04:19.282 --> 00:04:21.415
No pets. ever.

58
00:04:27.682 --> 00:04:28.944
Come on.

59
00:04:32.687 --> 00:04:34.123
Thanks.

60
00:04:40.825 --> 00:04:42.131
Please.

61
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.136
Help me.

62
00:04:49.486 --> 00:04:51.271
Help me.

63
00:04:55.275 --> 00:04:56.798
Help.

64
00:04:59.844 --> 00:05:01.411
Help.

65
00:05:44.062 --> 00:05:45.803
Hey.

66
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.328
Just making sure you didn't
sneak that dog back in.

67
00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:03.473
And since I'm the founder
and moderator.

68
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.562
it's my job to protect
its integrity.

69
00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:07.825
Right.
You don't want some dumb forum

70
00:06:07.912 --> 00:06:09.349
that's just girls
discussing sex tips.

71
00:06:09.436 --> 00:06:11.438
Right. since that's just
internalized misogyny.

72
00:06:11.525 --> 00:06:13.265
and it's boring. and stupid.

73
00:06:13.353 --> 00:06:16.138
Okay. but get this:
my co-moderator. LadyTalk.

74
00:06:16.225 --> 00:06:19.054
suddenly chimes in.
citing a statistic

75
00:06:19.141 --> 00:06:22.710
that 76% of women
are "into" dick pics.

76
00:06:22.797 --> 00:06:25.408
Really? 76% sounds high.

77
00:06:25.756 --> 00:06:28.803
First of all.
why would LadyTalk.

78
00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:30.631
my co-moderator.
let's not forget.

79
00:06:30.718 --> 00:06:32.589
even bring up
the dreaded dick pic

80
00:06:32.676 --> 00:06:35.723
knowing how hard we've worked
to create a safe space?

81
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.681
And then I think to myself.

82
00:06:37.768 --> 00:06:41.293
"What self-respected femme
even names herself LadyTalk?"

83
00:06:41.381 --> 00:06:44.122
She's trying to be
ironically old-fashioned?

84
00:06:44.209 --> 00:06:45.297
She's a guy.

85
00:06:46.298 --> 00:06:48.562
You think LadyTalk is a guy?

86
00:06:48.649 --> 00:06:51.391
Huh. So now what?

87
00:06:51.478 --> 00:06:53.349
I'm gonna call his ass out.

88
00:06:53.436 --> 00:06:54.829
Will you eat in the room
tonight with me

89
00:06:54.916 --> 00:06:56.004
and help me with this?

90
00:06:56.091 --> 00:06:57.962
I can't tonight.
I gotta work.

91
00:06:58.049 --> 00:06:59.964
Just call in sick.

92
00:07:00.051 --> 00:07:01.357
Margot. will you call in sick?

93
00:07:02.358 --> 00:07:07.015
♪ Well you are

94
00:07:08.886 --> 00:07:11.585

100
00:07:40.788 --> 00:07:43.747
S-sorry. You scared me.

101
00:07:43.834 --> 00:07:45.619
Well. people choose
to be scared.

102
00:07:47.011 --> 00:07:48.752
Did you see the queen?

103
00:07:48.839 --> 00:07:50.885
She still has her wings.

104
00:07:50.972 --> 00:07:52.495
That means
she's still a virgin.

105
00:07:52.582 --> 00:07:54.062
Really?

106
00:07:54.149 --> 00:07:56.281
Usually a girl
that popular is.

107
00:07:56.368 --> 00:07:57.674
you know. active.

108
00:07:57.761 --> 00:08:00.372
It's up to her to decide
when to copulate.

109
00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:01.983
Maybe she doesn't
want to be rushed.

110
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:03.898
and the male
will have to obey.

111
00:08:04.899 --> 00:08:08.076
She'll fly off and mate
with many partners.

112
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.861
A whole colony
for her pleasure.

113
00:08:14.125 --> 00:08:15.518
I hope you don't mind
I opened this.

114
00:08:15.605 --> 00:08:17.433
I saw the box
was from Tarquinia.

115
00:08:19.087 --> 00:08:21.176
Oh. yeah.
generally I don't allow it.

116
00:08:21.263 --> 00:08:23.657
but you're my favorite.
you know that.

117
00:08:23.744 --> 00:08:27.182
These are very precious bones.

118
00:08:27.269 --> 00:08:30.577
For example. what do you make
of this crack. hm?

119
00:08:30.664 --> 00:08:32.274
Doesn't seem like
a natural fracture.

120
00:08:32.361 --> 00:08:33.493
Mm-mm.

121
00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.060
It's almost like
someone sawed it.

122
00:08:38.193 --> 00:08:40.151
Do you think she was
offered up as a sacrifice?

123
00:08:40.238 --> 00:08:43.851
The tomb of the wolves
was in the business of death.

124
00:08:44.416 --> 00:08:47.507
torture. sacrifice.
and. of course. eroticism.

125
00:08:47.594 --> 00:08:49.596
If all that happened to her.

126
00:08:49.683 --> 00:08:51.598
hope she was reincarnated
as an ant.

127
00:08:51.685 --> 00:08:53.730
Better yet. in a queen bee.

128
00:08:53.817 --> 00:08:55.602
When the male
penetrates the queen.

129
00:08:55.689 --> 00:08:57.429
he loses his penis.

130
00:08:57.517 --> 00:09:01.346
In the act of pulling out.
he gets disemboweled and dies.

131
00:09:01.433 --> 00:09:04.306
The act of copulation
is their doom.

132
00:09:09.006 --> 00:09:11.269
<i> Under his spell.
she was both herself</i>

133
00:09:11.356 --> 00:09:12.749
<i>and another being.</i>

134
00:09:12.836 --> 00:09:15.709
<i>the She-Creature
seeking life sustenance</i>

135
00:09:15.796 --> 00:09:17.449
<i>from the stolen
heartbeats of others.</i>

136
00:09:17.972 --> 00:09:19.539
You came back.

137
00:09:19.626 --> 00:09:20.801
I did.

138
00:09:21.845 --> 00:09:24.413
Large popcorn
and. uh. Red Vines.

139
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.330
<i> She was a woman
born to be loved.</i>

140
00:09:28.417 --> 00:09:30.506
<i>and two men wanted her.</i>

141
00:09:30.593 --> 00:09:32.943
<i>One. a man whose
powerful math mind</i>

142
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.207
<i>controlled her every reflex.
except her love.</i>

143
00:09:37.774 --> 00:09:40.429
<i>The other willing
to fight any odds...</i>

144
00:09:40.516 --> 00:09:42.126
$9.50.

145
00:09:42.213 --> 00:09:43.954
I know.

146
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.697
You're getting better
at your job.

147
00:09:47.784 --> 00:09:49.830
Managed not
to insult me this time.

148
00:09:51.745 --> 00:09:54.225
Well. I'm up
for promotion. so...

149
00:09:56.097 --> 00:09:57.098
Enjoy the movie.

150
00:09:57.185 --> 00:09:58.534
Thank you.

151
00:09:58.621 --> 00:10:00.492
<i> Such as few people
have known.</i>

152
00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.234
<i>and only those
who see it can believe.</i>

153
00:10:06.411 --> 00:10:08.109
<i>I don't really know
what I'm going for.</i>

154
00:10:08.196 --> 00:10:10.764
<i>I know he's a killer.
And now you are traveling...</i>

155
00:10:10.851 --> 00:10:12.853
<i> What's wrong?
You're a tough guy.</i>

156
00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.550
<i>Go ahead and cream me.</i>

157
00:10:14.637 --> 00:10:17.161
<i>Break my arm. See if I care.</i>

158
00:10:23.385 --> 00:10:25.735
<i>I'm just gonna keep it
for a little while.</i>

159
00:10:25.822 --> 00:10:28.172
<i>You're an ogre.
just like my father.</i>

160
00:10:28.259 --> 00:10:30.871
<i>He won't let me stay out late
or play records or anything.</i>

161
00:10:32.524 --> 00:10:34.614
<i> Your father won't
let you stay out late?</i>

162
00:10:34.701 --> 00:10:36.224
<i>No. he's terrible.</i>

163
00:10:36.311 --> 00:10:38.879
<i>Once. I was at a party.
and it didn't end till late.</i>

164
00:10:38.966 --> 00:10:40.620
<i>He called the cops.</i>

165
00:10:40.707 --> 00:10:41.708
<i>Can you imagine?</i>

166
00:10:41.795 --> 00:10:42.926
<i>He had the whole
police force...</i>

167
00:10:43.013 --> 00:10:44.972
I was hoping you'd find me.

168
00:10:45.363 --> 00:10:46.626
I know.

169
00:10:46.713 --> 00:10:48.410
<i> Where is it
that you live. Carol?</i>

170
00:10:48.497 --> 00:10:50.847
<i> Over on Armana. Why?</i>

171
00:10:50.934 --> 00:10:53.415
<i>Oh. no. uh-uh.</i>

172
00:10:53.502 --> 00:10:55.809
<i>You thought I'd tell you
where I live?</i>

173
00:10:55.896 --> 00:10:57.767
<i>Not me. Not ole Carol.</i>

174
00:10:58.202 --> 00:11:00.030
<i>The night is young.
and I'm not hittin' the rack</i>

175
00:11:00.117 --> 00:11:01.902
<i>till I get a little action.</i>

176
00:11:01.989 --> 00:11:03.207
<i>
I eat popcorn.</i>

177
00:11:03.294 --> 00:11:04.600
<i>Everybody eats popcorn.</i>

178
00:11:04.687 --> 00:11:06.210
<i>It tastes real nice.</i>

179
00:11:06.297 --> 00:11:10.040
<i>Get yourself some now
at our refreshment stand.</i>

180
00:11:10.127 --> 00:11:11.781
<i>Yum. yum.</i>

181
00:11:11.868 --> 00:11:15.176
<i>It's time for a tasty
and refreshing snack.</i>

182
00:11:21.617 --> 00:11:22.879
Oh. hey.

183
00:11:23.575 --> 00:11:25.708
So fun fact about
"American Graffiti."

184
00:11:25.795 --> 00:11:28.232
Mackenzie Phillips was 12
when she made that film.

185
00:11:28.319 --> 00:11:30.321
which probably violated
child labor laws.

186
00:11:30.408 --> 00:11:32.454
but she is really funny

187
00:11:32.541 --> 00:11:34.978
and. you know.
precocious for 12.

188
00:11:35.065 --> 00:11:37.677
Yeah. Yeah. listen. uh...

189
00:11:38.982 --> 00:11:41.289
Concession Stand Girl...

190
00:11:42.682 --> 00:11:44.335

"My user name is LadyTalk.

198
00:12:31.818 --> 00:12:33.776
but my real name
is James Madley.

199
00:12:33.863 --> 00:12:35.691
and I joined the Vagenda
because I'm interested

200
00:12:35.778 --> 00:12:38.912
in women's issues and being
a part of the solution."

201
00:12:38.999 --> 00:12:40.652
Look at that. he owned it.

202
00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.132
Are you defending
this troll?

203
00:12:42.219 --> 00:12:43.438
Who says he's a troll?

204
00:12:43.525 --> 00:12:44.526
And people lurk in forums

205
00:12:44.613 --> 00:12:46.006
all the time with fake names.

206
00:12:46.093 --> 00:12:47.268
BitchPerfect.

207
00:12:47.355 --> 00:12:49.226
Yeah. but that's
clever and funny.

208
00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:52.142
Ladies. final dress is...

209
00:12:52.229 --> 00:12:53.665
Tonight!

210
00:12:53.753 --> 00:12:55.624
I need you to help
us spread the good word

211
00:12:55.711 --> 00:12:57.931
if you can.
That would be so helpful.

212
00:12:58.018 --> 00:12:59.497
Thank you. babes.
- Sure.

213
00:12:59.584 --> 00:13:02.500
Sure. Would love that.

214
00:13:06.026 --> 00:13:07.941
Is that that guy
Robert again?

215
00:13:08.942 --> 00:13:10.726
Wait. you never said
where he goes to school.

216
00:13:10.813 --> 00:13:11.945
He's. like. 25.

217
00:13:12.032 --> 00:13:13.816
I'm sure he just works.

218
00:13:13.903 --> 00:13:16.645
25. but he's still. uh...
he's still cute. right?

219
00:13:16.732 --> 00:13:19.474
Ish. He's. like. super tall.

220
00:13:19.561 --> 00:13:21.737
But I like tall.
- You love tall.

221
00:13:21.824 --> 00:13:23.086
And his eyes are nice.

222
00:13:23.173 --> 00:13:25.915
They crinkle.
- Yeah. 'cause he's old.

223
00:13:26.394 --> 00:13:28.613
What about the texting?
He got good banter?

224
00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.398
It's good so far.

225
00:13:30.485 --> 00:13:32.269
He's smart and funny.

226
00:13:32.356 --> 00:13:34.924
and he has cats.
Yan and Mu.

227
00:13:35.011 --> 00:13:36.317
He's at the vet
with them right now.

228
00:13:36.404 --> 00:13:37.579
A caretaker.

229
00:13:37.666 --> 00:13:39.537
God. Yan and Mu
are so hilarious.

230
00:13:39.624 --> 00:13:40.712
How can cats be funny?

231
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.018
Well. I mean.
Robert's hilarious.

232
00:13:42.105 --> 00:13:43.237
- Oh.
- Yeah. when he's talking

233
00:13:43.324 --> 00:13:44.760
like them.
- Pause.

234
00:13:44.847 --> 00:13:46.936
He does cat voices?

235
00:13:47.023 --> 00:13:49.286
Oh. that is adorable and sexy.

236
00:13:49.373 --> 00:13:50.810
Mrow!

237
00:13:50.897 --> 00:13:52.812
Wait. you're setting clear
text boundaries. right?

238
00:13:52.899 --> 00:13:55.162
- Oh. my God. Taylor.
- I'm dead serious.

239
00:13:55.249 --> 00:13:56.511
Remember what we said?

240
00:13:56.598 --> 00:13:57.642
I won't double text. okay?

241
00:13:57.729 --> 00:13:59.514
- Don't double text. ever.
- I got it.

242
00:13:59.601 --> 00:14:03.300
And let one text. at least.
go unanswered a day.

243
00:14:03.387 --> 00:14:06.477
Okay. he needs to understand
that you're setting the rules

244
00:14:06.564 --> 00:14:08.610
and he's lucky you're
acknowledging his existence.

245
00:14:08.697 --> 00:14:10.177
I get it.

246
00:14:10.264 --> 00:14:11.482
Thank you.
- Good.

247
00:14:11.569 --> 00:14:14.659
Or you could just have
a good time with him.

248
00:14:14.746 --> 00:14:17.053
I mean. Dave and I.
we barely knew each other

249
00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:18.968
when we joined the Madrigals.

250
00:14:19.055 --> 00:14:21.231
Hm. and look at you now.
you're a character

251
00:14:21.318 --> 00:14:22.929
that doesn't even have
their own name.

252
00:14:23.016 --> 00:14:24.408
You're just the Baker's Wife.

253
00:14:24.495 --> 00:14:25.845
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

254
00:14:25.932 --> 00:14:27.759
Uh. my character doesn't
have a name either.

255
00:14:27.847 --> 00:14:28.804
I'm just the Baker.

256
00:14:28.891 --> 00:14:30.501
At least you have a job.

257
00:14:30.893 --> 00:14:33.635
My point is.
Dave and I were just real easy

258
00:14:33.722 --> 00:14:34.897
about it when we first met.

259
00:14:34.984 --> 00:14:36.464
and look at us.

260
00:14:36.551 --> 00:14:38.292
We've been in love ever since.

261
00:14:39.423 --> 00:14:42.078
We changed...

262
00:14:42.165 --> 00:14:43.993
We're strangers...

263
00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:46.735
I'm meeting you
in the woods.

264
00:14:46.822 --> 00:14:48.519
Who minds.

265
00:14:48.606 --> 00:14:50.347
What dangers.

266
00:14:50.434 --> 00:14:53.873
I hope we'll get
past the woods!

267
00:16:44.374 --> 00:16:45.680
Hey.

268
00:16:48.117 --> 00:16:50.206
Uh. how's it going?

269
00:16:50.293 --> 00:16:51.338
Good. You?

270
00:16:52.295 --> 00:16:53.731
Uh. yeah. it was. like.

271
00:16:53.818 --> 00:16:56.647
two miles from that...
that. uh. parking lot.

272
00:16:57.997 --> 00:17:00.173
Told you it's far.

273
00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.349
Yeah. it's-it's a trek.

274
00:17:03.437 --> 00:17:04.568
Um...

275
00:17:06.614 --> 00:17:08.398
So as promised...

276
00:17:10.705 --> 00:17:13.751
Bamm-Bamm Fruity Pebbles?

277
00:17:13.838 --> 00:17:15.971
Yeah. I had to go to two
different Krogers to. uh...

278
00:17:16.058 --> 00:17:18.452
to find that.
and then the 7-Eleven for the...

279
00:17:18.539 --> 00:17:20.715
the rest of the treasure.

280
00:17:22.456 --> 00:17:24.284
That's so sweet.

281
00:17:26.547 --> 00:17:28.984
So I'll hand this
off to you and...

282
00:17:30.899 --> 00:17:32.596
Do you want to come in?

283
00:17:35.991 --> 00:17:38.733
We can eat.
but only at this table.

284
00:17:39.429 --> 00:17:42.128
You know. everything in here's.
like. 3.000 years old.

285
00:17:42.911 --> 00:17:45.305
Yeah. it's very "Nosferatu."

286
00:17:45.392 --> 00:17:46.610
Right?

287
00:17:46.697 --> 00:17:48.221
Did you know
we did a vampire series

288
00:17:48.308 --> 00:17:49.483
just last month
at the fourplex?

289
00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:51.789
Yeah. yeah.
you included "Blacula."

290
00:17:51.876 --> 00:17:53.704
Well. I didn't
include anything.

291
00:17:53.791 --> 00:17:55.141
I just made the popcorn.

292
00:17:55.228 --> 00:17:56.707
No. my point is.

293
00:17:57.099 --> 00:17:59.797
"Blacula" doesn't belong
in the vampire category.

294
00:17:59.884 --> 00:18:01.582
It belongs in blaxploitation.

295
00:18:02.278 --> 00:18:04.585
Yeah. obviously.

296
00:18:04.672 --> 00:18:08.154
and I did mention that
to the owners at the time.

297
00:18:13.724 --> 00:18:15.335
Do you want...

298
00:18:15.422 --> 00:18:17.293
Sure. yeah. Thanks.

299
00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:21.210
You said you were starving.
so I got a bunch of...

300
00:18:23.517 --> 00:18:25.910
Red Vines. Of course.

301
00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.827
Ooh. I think
the Slurpee spilled a little.

302
00:18:30.741 --> 00:18:32.221
Yeah. it's wild cherry.

303
00:18:32.308 --> 00:18:33.483
Mm.

304
00:18:35.181 --> 00:18:36.312
My favorite.

305
00:18:42.144 --> 00:18:43.537
And this is...

306
00:18:43.624 --> 00:18:47.106
It's a frog lighter
with a cigarette in its mouth.

307
00:18:47.193 --> 00:18:49.108
So cute.

308
00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:51.849
I don't smoke.

309
00:18:51.936 --> 00:18:54.025
- Me either.
- Good.

310
00:18:54.113 --> 00:18:55.244
Yeah.

311
00:18:59.074 --> 00:19:00.293
Ow.

312
00:19:01.946 --> 00:19:03.861
Stupid ant. bit me.

313
00:19:14.002 --> 00:19:14.872
Dead.

314
00:19:15.786 --> 00:19:17.484
Murdered.
- Yeah.

315
00:19:18.311 --> 00:19:20.182
Must've escaped
from the colony.

316
00:19:36.285 --> 00:19:38.592
The queen's the big one.
with the wings.

317
00:19:46.469 --> 00:19:48.079
Oh. that's just storage.

318
00:20:17.631 --> 00:20:18.893
What's this?

319
00:20:31.906 --> 00:20:33.603
They're Etruscan artifacts.

320
00:20:34.909 --> 00:20:37.433
- Etruscan artifacts?
- Yeah.

321
00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:39.566
Pretty sure
they're just human bones.

322
00:20:40.044 --> 00:20:42.133
They're both. from Tarquinia.

323
00:20:42.221 --> 00:20:44.223
- Tarq...
- Italy.

324
00:20:45.485 --> 00:20:48.270
Where they recently discovered
a non-funerary burial site.

325
00:20:48.357 --> 00:20:50.751
Mm. Buried with no funeral.

326
00:20:50.838 --> 00:20:51.795
Sacrificed.

327
00:20:52.709 --> 00:20:53.841
Fucking dark. I know.

328
00:20:54.363 --> 00:20:55.712
See this first skull?

329
00:20:56.452 --> 00:20:58.498
It was probably a slave
who was decapitated.

330
00:20:58.585 --> 00:21:00.543
Then just her body was buried

331
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:02.284
at the base
of the temple wall.

332
00:21:02.371 --> 00:21:04.286
Her body meant
to provide support.

333
00:21:04.852 --> 00:21:09.160
in a sacrificial annihilating
kind of support way.

334
00:21:24.611 --> 00:21:26.177
Why did you shut the door?

335
00:21:27.004 --> 00:21:28.832
I-I didn't.

336
00:21:28.919 --> 00:21:30.443
It-it shut on its own.

337
00:21:31.835 --> 00:21:33.533
Doors don't just shut.

338
00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:35.622
No. I-I guess this one did.

339
00:21:35.709 --> 00:21:39.321
It must've slipped from
the thing that was holding it.

340
00:21:40.627 --> 00:21:41.976
I think it's locked.

341
00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:49.200
Or...

342
00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:52.943
I did it on purpose

343
00:21:54.249 --> 00:21:58.340
because I'm actually...

344
00:21:58.427 --> 00:21:59.515
a werewolf.

345
00:22:02.301 --> 00:22:04.825
Good idea for a series
at the fourplex.

346
00:22:04.912 --> 00:22:06.392
werewolf movies.

347
00:22:06.479 --> 00:22:08.742
Yeah. and the filing cabinet
scene from "The Howling."

348
00:22:08.829 --> 00:22:10.309
that's about
to happen right now.

349
00:22:11.353 --> 00:22:13.399
I just meant a door
doesn't just shut

350
00:22:13.486 --> 00:22:14.748
or lock on its own.

351
00:22:16.097 --> 00:22:17.316
You sure you didn't close it?

352
00:22:18.012 --> 00:22:19.100
Here. can I...

353
00:22:25.802 --> 00:22:27.064
Hold still.

354
00:22:27.151 --> 00:22:28.414
Don't make this hard.

355
00:22:33.549 --> 00:22:34.463
Hey. hey.

356
00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:35.856
Just... just take it easy.

357
00:22:35.943 --> 00:22:36.987
No. get off me!

358
00:22:37.074 --> 00:22:39.207
Just let me. okay?

359
00:23:06.408 --> 00:23:08.802
Seventeen years
I nurtured this colony.

360
00:23:08.889 --> 00:23:10.847
I know. and I'm so sorry.

361
00:23:10.934 --> 00:23:13.415
Here. here is the queen.

362
00:23:13.502 --> 00:23:14.677
dead.

363
00:23:15.548 --> 00:23:17.898
Dead. whoever you are.

364
00:23:19.378 --> 00:23:22.598
Sorry. uh. Robert.
this is Dr. Zaballa.

365
00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.732
Dr. Z. this is Robert.

366
00:23:25.819 --> 00:23:28.561
I was...
I was just stopping by. uh.

367
00:23:28.648 --> 00:23:32.652
but I'm... I'm so sorry
about... about that colony.

368
00:23:32.739 --> 00:23:34.784
That was a thing of beauty.

369
00:23:34.871 --> 00:23:38.309
The worker ants. they fought
hard to defend the queen.

370
00:23:39.267 --> 00:23:40.747
They're all females.

371
00:23:40.834 --> 00:23:41.791
Right.

372
00:23:42.705 --> 00:23:43.706
Oh. you know that?

373
00:23:44.707 --> 00:23:45.969
Are you a myrmecologist?

374
00:23:47.014 --> 00:23:49.843
- Myrmecology is...
- Is the study of ants. I know.

375
00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:53.847
Um. I'm not. but I do...
I know a bit about them.

376
00:23:53.934 --> 00:23:55.457
Then perhaps you know

377
00:23:55.979 --> 00:23:58.721
that the males did nothing
to defend the queen.

378
00:23:59.592 --> 00:24:02.377
but they dug their own grave.
haven't they. Robert?

379
00:24:03.378 --> 00:24:06.903
Because a colony
without the queen will die.

380
00:24:24.704 --> 00:24:28.403
I just wanted to say thank you

381
00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:30.144
for the great snacks.

382
00:24:32.276 --> 00:24:33.495
No problem.

383
00:24:38.631 --> 00:24:40.546
So my fall break
starts tomorrow.

384
00:24:40.633 --> 00:24:42.548
so I'm gonna go back
home for a while.

385
00:24:44.506 --> 00:24:45.855
I hope you'll text me.

386
00:24:48.945 --> 00:24:50.164
Will you?

387
00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.819
I...

388
00:24:52.906 --> 00:24:54.647
Look. it wasn't you
that made me react

389
00:24:54.734 --> 00:24:56.518
like that. okay?

390
00:24:57.519 --> 00:24:58.694
I'm really sorry.

391
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:05.614
And...

392
00:25:07.355 --> 00:25:09.923
I hope tonight doesn't count
as a first date.

393
00:25:13.274 --> 00:25:14.580
Oh. we don't have to count it.

394
00:25:21.151 --> 00:25:22.501
Let's not count it.

395
00:25:41.345 --> 00:25:44.479
Hot washcloths on the bites.

396
00:25:44.566 --> 00:25:46.133
to stop the itching.

397
00:25:47.482 --> 00:25:49.789
Don't use ice. okay?

398
00:25:49.876 --> 00:25:51.094
Okay.

399
00:25:52.835 --> 00:25:56.230
Have a safe trip back
home. and. uh...

400
00:25:57.753 --> 00:25:59.450
I'll see you soon. sweetheart.

No. Kelly. that's impossible.

411
00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.568
We'll definitely need to set up

412
00:27:13.655 --> 00:27:14.917
a serving station in the garage.

413
00:27:15.004 --> 00:27:16.440
But. but. but where's
the ice sculpture going?

414
00:27:16.527 --> 00:27:17.920
That's supposed
to be a surprise.

415
00:27:18.007 --> 00:27:19.269
and it's not like
you can just hide

416
00:27:19.356 --> 00:27:20.749
300 pounds of decorative ice.

417
00:27:20.836 --> 00:27:22.621
Before-- Before we get
too in a fluff here. Kelly.

418
00:27:22.708 --> 00:27:23.970
why don't we just
take a deep breath?

419
00:27:24.057 --> 00:27:26.233
Do not tell me
to breathe. Todd. please.

420
00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.278
Margot. you...
you have been on that phone

421
00:27:28.365 --> 00:27:30.629
since you got here.
Who are you texting?

422
00:27:31.499 --> 00:27:32.718
Oh. is it a boy?

423
00:27:32.805 --> 00:27:34.763
Oh. she's finally
not being so picky

424
00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:36.504
and she likes a boy.
- Kelly. can we just...

425
00:27:36.591 --> 00:27:39.507
I will breathe tomorrow
in yoga class. okay?

426
00:27:39.594 --> 00:27:42.031
Oh. birthday boy.
close your ears. honey.

427
00:27:42.118 --> 00:27:45.295
Oh. let's can
the cutesy stuff. okay?

428
00:27:45.382 --> 00:27:47.428
Okay. Honey. um.
could you just

429
00:27:47.515 --> 00:27:49.691
help us out by moving
your car out of the garage?

430
00:27:49.778 --> 00:27:51.519
- No. it's charging.

431
00:27:51.606 --> 00:27:54.304
Okay. well. there must be
another plug someplace. honey.

432
00:27:54.391 --> 00:27:55.915
We have 200 guests
arriving here--

433
00:27:56.002 --> 00:27:58.004
In six hours. and the guys
are coming to get me.

434
00:27:58.091 --> 00:27:59.875
and we're going to the Y.
The Y?

435
00:27:59.962 --> 00:28:01.529
Are you on that damn
phone again?

436
00:28:01.616 --> 00:28:02.922
She's texting a boy.

437
00:28:03.009 --> 00:28:04.097
What's his name?

438
00:28:06.577 --> 00:28:07.709
- Robert.
- Robert.

439
00:28:07.796 --> 00:28:09.319
Mm-hmm.
His name is Robert.

440
00:28:09.406 --> 00:28:12.105
My first affair was with
a sous-chef named Robert.

441
00:28:12.192 --> 00:28:13.802
You're having an affair?

442
00:28:13.889 --> 00:28:15.456
Could we please focus
on the hundreds of guests

443
00:28:15.543 --> 00:28:16.544
that are arriving
here any minute?

444
00:28:16.631 --> 00:28:17.893
In six hours.

445
00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:19.503
You are not old enough
to have an affair.

446
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:21.723
Okay. can we all just
stop saying "affair"?

447
00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:23.812
It's not even what this is...

448
00:28:23.899 --> 00:28:24.813
yet.

449
00:28:25.901 --> 00:28:27.903
And Robert is a very
interesting man.

450
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:30.253
Oh. a man.

451
00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:31.515
So he's older?

452
00:28:31.602 --> 00:28:33.387
Maybe he's mature.

453
00:28:33.474 --> 00:28:35.519
Or maybe he's not.

454
00:28:35.606 --> 00:28:37.783
In fact. Robert and I
might even move in together.

455
00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:39.523
We'll have a sweet little home

456
00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:41.221
where people will want
to come over and hang out

457
00:28:41.308 --> 00:28:43.440
'cause it's so warm
and inviting and nonintrusive.

458
00:28:43.527 --> 00:28:45.051
Okay. you're texting a man

459
00:28:45.138 --> 00:28:47.140
that you're gonna live with.
I want to talk to this Robert.

460
00:28:47.227 --> 00:28:49.011
Hey. Ernie. honey.
could you give us that little.

461
00:28:49.098 --> 00:28:50.970
um. card that you wave
to start the car?

462
00:28:51.057 --> 00:28:53.102
Kelly. honey.
this is my birthday.

463
00:28:53.189 --> 00:28:55.801
Stop hammering me
about the damn car.

464
00:28:55.888 --> 00:28:57.628
Oh. about tonight.

465
00:28:57.716 --> 00:29:00.501
I don't want any reference
to which birthday this is.

466
00:29:00.588 --> 00:29:01.981
okay. no announcement
about the fact

467
00:29:02.068 --> 00:29:03.373
that I got one foot in the box.

468
00:29:08.248 --> 00:29:09.510
You've got 300 pounds of ice

469
00:29:09.597 --> 00:29:10.990
in the shape
of a six and a zero.

470
00:29:12.295 --> 00:29:13.775
Let it melt.

471
00:29:17.561 --> 00:29:19.694
Why not?
It'll make him so happy.

472
00:29:19.781 --> 00:29:21.435
Because I don't
want to sing tonight.

473
00:29:21.522 --> 00:29:23.263
and it's a dumb song.

474
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:26.092
Dumb?
Marilyn Monroe sang this song.

475
00:29:26.179 --> 00:29:27.484
Yeah. well. things have
changed a little

476
00:29:27.571 --> 00:29:28.964
since Marilyn's day.
- Oh. you know. don't make--

477
00:29:29.051 --> 00:29:30.226
don't make me tired.

478
00:29:30.313 --> 00:29:32.576
I-I read.

479
00:29:32.663 --> 00:29:33.969
I talk to the girls at the gym.

480
00:29:34.056 --> 00:29:36.015
Yeah. things have changed
on the surface.

481
00:29:36.102 --> 00:29:37.843
which means they haven't
really changed at all.

482
00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:39.627
That's something that girls
your age don't understand.

483
00:29:39.714 --> 00:29:40.889
Oh. my God. Here we go.

484
00:29:40.976 --> 00:29:42.761
"Girls my age."
- Yes. girls your age.

485
00:29:42.848 --> 00:29:44.850
I don't know.
you're so self-involved.

486
00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:46.765
You're so entitled.

487
00:29:46.852 --> 00:29:48.549
I mean. is it.
is it your birthday.

488
00:29:48.636 --> 00:29:50.725
or is it Ernie's birthday?
- Are you serious?

489
00:29:50.812 --> 00:29:52.596
I just said I didn't want
to sing the song.

490
00:29:52.683 --> 00:29:54.903
It's weird.
It's uncomfortable.

491
00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:56.165
Oh. well. you know what?

492
00:29:56.252 --> 00:29:57.688
Things aren't always
100% comfortable.

493
00:29:57.776 --> 00:29:59.168
Get over it.
And you know what?

494
00:29:59.255 --> 00:30:02.128
If you. if you want
to get along with a man

495
00:30:02.215 --> 00:30:04.173
and not be alone
your whole entire life

496
00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:06.915
and build a relationship
that actually lasts.

497
00:30:07.002 --> 00:30:10.658
make peace with a little
discomfort now and then.

498
00:30:10.745 --> 00:30:13.095
a little compromise. okay?

499
00:30:13.182 --> 00:30:15.489
I wish. I wish I had known that

500
00:30:15.576 --> 00:30:17.621
the first time around.
with your father.

501
00:30:17.708 --> 00:30:18.884
- Mom.
- He thought he wasn't

502
00:30:18.971 --> 00:30:20.450
my number one.
and there's a few things

503
00:30:20.537 --> 00:30:21.756
I should've done
to let him know.

504
00:30:21.843 --> 00:30:24.411
Mom. it's not
your fault he left.

505
00:30:24.498 --> 00:30:25.760
It isn't.

506
00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:31.287
You know. I get it.

507
00:30:31.374 --> 00:30:33.768

00:32:01.247 --> 00:32:02.596
or anything yet. but...

532
00:32:03.989 --> 00:32:05.164
I think I really like him.

533
00:32:05.251 --> 00:32:06.817
Good.

534
00:32:06.905 --> 00:32:08.732
Well. he's got to go
through me first. so...

535
00:32:10.647 --> 00:32:11.648
- So?
- Hm?

536
00:32:11.735 --> 00:32:13.041
What about you?

537
00:32:13.128 --> 00:32:14.651
Anyone special?

538
00:32:14.738 --> 00:32:16.436
- Um...
- Any... any guys?

539
00:32:16.523 --> 00:32:18.046
Oh. yeah. right.

540
00:32:18.133 --> 00:32:19.918
last time we talked.
I was exploring sex with men.

541
00:32:20.005 --> 00:32:21.920
Um...
- You're not still?

542
00:32:22.007 --> 00:32:25.445
Uh. what I've realized.
actually. is...

543
00:32:25.532 --> 00:32:27.229
I'm an ace...

544
00:32:28.317 --> 00:32:30.929
Uh. which is what
asexuals call themselves.

545
00:32:32.843 --> 00:32:34.454
Do you remember
when we were together

546
00:32:34.541 --> 00:32:37.065
just how. like.
out of my body I was.

547
00:32:37.152 --> 00:32:40.851
how I could never really.
like. enjoy sex?

548
00:32:40.939 --> 00:32:42.853
So I thought I must be gay.

549
00:32:42.941 --> 00:32:44.290
and so then I tried that.

550
00:32:44.377 --> 00:32:46.422
and then that was just.
like. even weirder.

551
00:32:46.509 --> 00:32:49.338
Like. all of this. like.
bizarre pressure to.

552
00:32:49.425 --> 00:32:51.297
like. perform and to.
like. be this. like.

553
00:32:51.384 --> 00:32:54.604
sexual Tarzan or something.
and it felt awful.

554
00:32:54.691 --> 00:32:56.432
So then I looked it up.

555
00:32:56.519 --> 00:32:59.305
and it turns out
that being asexual is.

556
00:32:59.392 --> 00:33:00.959
like. a real thing.

557
00:33:01.046 --> 00:33:03.962
and since then.
I've just felt this relief

558
00:33:04.049 --> 00:33:06.965
because I finally don't have
to pretend to like sex anymore.

559
00:33:09.924 --> 00:33:13.014
Is-is that okay for me to say?

560
00:33:13.101 --> 00:33:14.973
- Oh. my God. yeah. of course.
- Okay.

561
00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:16.844
Of course. I...

562
00:33:16.931 --> 00:33:19.368
But it's not like it was
because of. like. you.

563
00:33:19.455 --> 00:33:20.891
If you'd been the hottest
girl in the world.

564
00:33:20.979 --> 00:33:23.459
I would've still been. like...

565
00:33:23.546 --> 00:33:24.852
And-and not that you're not.

566
00:33:24.939 --> 00:33:25.984
Not that you're--
- Okay.

567
00:33:26.071 --> 00:33:27.463
- Because you are.
- Clay. I get it.

568
00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:28.595
Okay.

569
00:33:29.988 --> 00:33:31.990

Mikey. why don't I hear you

shucking oysters? Come on.

581
00:36:02.836 --> 00:36:04.316
I'm not saying
he's avoiding me.

582
00:36:04.403 --> 00:36:07.449
He still texts every day.
says good morning. good night.

583
00:36:07.536 --> 00:36:08.798
Oh. maybe he's a doorman.

584

What's weird. though. is.

585
00:36:10.278 --> 00:36:11.410
about getting together again--

586
00:36:13.716 --> 00:36:15.457
Seriously? The buzzer?

587
00:36:15.544 --> 00:36:16.850
Somebody's got to stop you.

588
00:36:16.937 --> 00:36:19.026
You know. I could really
use some support here.

589
00:36:19.113 --> 00:36:21.637
I'm trying to figure out
what's going on with this guy.

590
00:36:21.724 --> 00:36:24.684
I'm worried he misinterpreted
a text I sent.

591
00:36:24.771 --> 00:36:26.468
Text you sent?
What does that mean?

592
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:29.819
No. A pic?

593
00:36:29.906 --> 00:36:31.604
No. What...

594
00:36:32.605 --> 00:36:33.823
Tit. ass. pussy?

595
00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:35.999
What?
- No. of course not.

596
00:36:36.086 --> 00:36:37.523
Look. it doesn't matter
what the text was. okay?

597
00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:39.699
I just don't want
to play games with him.

598
00:36:39.786 --> 00:36:41.527
Right. so you'd just rather
expose your vulnerable soul

599
00:36:41.614 --> 00:36:43.137
to a fucking bearded giant?

600
00:36:43.746 --> 00:36:45.792
Seriously. this is me
being supportive.

601
00:36:45.879 --> 00:36:48.055
He holds all the cards
right now. so please.

602
00:36:48.142 --> 00:36:49.491
Margot. for the love of women.

603
00:36:49.578 --> 00:36:51.319
just take back your cards.

604
00:36:58.108 --> 00:37:00.676
I know it's him.
- Actually. no.

605
00:37:00.763 --> 00:37:02.374
It's my mom.
worried I don't have

606
00:37:02.461 --> 00:37:05.159
enough down in my
winter coat. bizarrely.

607
00:37:05.246 --> 00:37:06.291
The woman's insane.

608
00:37:53.294 --> 00:37:54.948
That's where I work.

609
00:37:56.384 --> 00:37:59.082
And "Star Wars" is boring!

610
00:38:38.296 --> 00:38:41.124
Hey.
- Hey.

611
00:38:42.952 --> 00:38:44.214
Let's do this.

612
00:38:44.302 --> 00:38:46.478
We're doing it. Um...

613
00:39:02.842 --> 00:39:05.323
So...

614
00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:08.326
when was the last time
you saw "Empire Strikes Back"?

615
00:39:10.893 --> 00:39:12.765
June.

616
00:39:12.852 --> 00:39:14.157
Of this year?

617
00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:17.030
Wow.

618
00:39:17.117 --> 00:39:19.075
So you've seen it a lot.

619
00:39:21.904 --> 00:39:24.864
The only movie I've seen
that often is "Spirited Away."

620
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:29.129
Do you know it?

621
00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:31.436
Yeah. I know the director.

622
00:39:31.523 --> 00:39:32.915
but I haven't. haven't seen it.

623
00:40:00.639 --> 00:40:02.205
I'm not gonna murder you.

624
00:40:03.859 --> 00:40:05.121
Why would you say that?

625
00:40:06.035 --> 00:40:07.341
It was a joke.

626
00:40:09.822 --> 00:40:11.867
I know it was a joke.

627
00:40:13.782 --> 00:40:15.654
And hey. you can murder me
if you want.

628
00:40:17.482 --> 00:40:18.874
Good to know.

629
00:40:25.359 --> 00:40:26.839
<i> Here.
And. Chewie?</i>

630
00:40:29.581 --> 00:40:31.321
<i>I think we ought to replace
the negative power coupling.</i>

631
00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:47.947
Oh. no. I--

632
00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:50.863
Right. Right.

633
00:40:54.257 --> 00:40:57.260
<i>Hey. Your Worship.
I'm only trying to help.</i>

634
00:40:57.347 --> 00:40:59.437
I'd forgotten
so much of this movie.

635
00:41:01.308 --> 00:41:03.005
You'll remember if you watch.

636
00:41:03.092 --> 00:41:05.138
<i>- So difficult sometimes.
- I do. I really do.</i>

637
00:41:06.269 --> 00:41:08.576
<i>You could be a little
nicer. though.</i>

638
00:41:08.663 --> 00:41:11.231
<i>Come on. admit it. Sometimes
you think I'm all right.</i>

639
00:41:13.668 --> 00:41:15.844
<i>Occasionally. maybe.</i>

640
00:41:15.931 --> 00:41:17.455
I was completely
obsessed with Leia's

641
00:41:17.542 --> 00:41:18.847
side buns when I was a kid.

642
00:41:18.934 --> 00:41:20.545
<i>Scoundrel?</i>

643
00:41:20.632 --> 00:41:21.937
<i>Scoundrel?</i>

644
00:41:24.374 --> 00:41:26.246
<i>I like the sound of that.</i>

645
00:41:27.029 --> 00:41:28.291
<i>Stop that.</i>

646
00:41:28.378 --> 00:41:29.858
<i>Stop what?</i>

647
00:41:29.945 --> 00:41:32.078
<i>Stop that.
My hands are dirty.</i>

648
00:41:32.165 --> 00:41:34.559
<i>My hands are dirty too.
What are you afraid of?</i>

649
00:41:34.646 --> 00:41:35.777
<i>Afraid?</i>

650
00:41:35.864 --> 00:41:37.170
<i>You're trembling.</i>

651
00:41:37.257 --> 00:41:38.911
<i>I'm not trembling.</i>

652
00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:43.785
<i>You like me
because I'm a scoundrel.</i>

653
00:41:43.872 --> 00:41:45.918
<i>There are no scoundrels
in your life.</i>

654
00:41:46.005 --> 00:41:48.355
<i>I happen to like nice men.</i>

655
00:41:48.442 --> 00:41:49.835
<i>I'm a nice man.</i>

656
00:41:49.922 --> 00:41:51.184
<i>No. you're not. You're--</i>

657
00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:57.451
<i>Sir. sir. I've isolated
the reverse power flux
coupling!</i>

658
00:42:00.236 --> 00:42:02.717
<i>Thank you.
Thank you very much.</i>

659
00:42:02.804 --> 00:42:05.024
<i>Oh. you're perfectly
welcome. sir.</i>

660
00:42:21.736 --> 00:42:25.392
So. uh. do you want
to get a drink or...

661
00:42:26.175 --> 00:42:28.569
We could get a drink. I guess.

662
00:42:28.656 --> 00:42:29.875
If you want.

663
00:42:34.488 --> 00:42:36.098
What's up?

664
00:42:36.577 --> 00:42:38.405
Nothing.

665
00:42:38.492 --> 00:42:39.928
Just tired.

666
00:42:41.495 --> 00:42:43.889
I'm sorry. I g...
Yeah. I guess you hated it.

667
00:42:45.673 --> 00:42:48.546
It's the first romantic movie
I ever saw. so I-I figured...

668
00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:57.598
It was about sharing.
it was about sharing

669
00:42:57.685 --> 00:43:00.340
something with her that I love

670
00:43:00.427 --> 00:43:03.386
that's romantic because...

671
00:43:04.953 --> 00:43:08.827
Because your feelings
for her are romantic.

672
00:43:08.914 --> 00:43:12.570
Margot is bright.
Margot is sophisticated.

673
00:43:12.657 --> 00:43:14.223
She knows about movies.

674
00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:18.053
She goes for the subtitled
stuff. like Japanese films.

675
00:43:19.751 --> 00:43:21.579
Maybe she's just
smarter than me.

676
00:43:24.364 --> 00:43:27.149
And that's intimidating.

677
00:43:33.025 --> 00:43:35.593
You don't have to apologize
for the movie.

678
00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:36.942
There were lots of great
moments in it.

679
00:43:37.029 --> 00:43:39.727
like. uh. when Leia says
"I love you" and Han says...

680
00:43:39.814 --> 00:43:41.424
- "I know."
- Yeah.

681
00:43:41.511 --> 00:43:42.904
Classic. right?
- "Hahn. Hahn."

682
00:43:42.991 --> 00:43:44.253
- "Hahn?"
- You said "Haan."

683
00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:45.428
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

684
00:43:45.515 --> 00:43:46.604
Um...

685
00:43:47.996 --> 00:43:49.389
Yeah. I love that.

686
00:43:50.999 --> 00:43:52.348
It was a good idea.

687
00:43:52.435 --> 00:43:54.612
and a drink
is an even better idea.

688
00:43:55.264 --> 00:43:56.788
Okay.

689
00:43:56.875 --> 00:43:58.703
Now we're talking.

690
00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:00.835
So where do.
where do you like to go?

691
00:44:00.922 --> 00:44:02.576
I like Sonny's.

692
00:44:02.663 --> 00:44:04.404
Sonny's. the student ghetto?

693
00:44:05.579 --> 00:44:07.363
I'll take you someplace better.

694
00:44:08.538 --> 00:44:13.805
♪ Yummy. yummy. yummy
I got love in my tummy ♪

695
00:44:13.892 --> 00:44:17.809
♪ And I feel
like loving you... ♪

696
00:44:18.505 --> 00:44:20.812
They make a mean whiskey sour.

697
00:44:20.899 --> 00:44:22.422
Yup. you're good.

698
00:44:22.509 --> 00:44:23.771
We don't have to wait in line.

699
00:44:23.858 --> 00:44:25.120
The guy knows me.

700
00:44:26.295 --> 00:44:27.906
- Yup. you're good.
- Hey. uh. I don't think--

701
00:44:27.993 --> 00:44:29.168
- Hey. man. Hey.
- Hey. man.

702
00:44:29.255 --> 00:44:30.822
- Good to see you. Yeah.
- How are you?

703
00:44:30.909 --> 00:44:32.562
Uh. excuse me.
I just need to see your ID.

704
00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:34.477
- Uh. I'm with him.
- Oh. yeah. She's with me.

starting something. and then.

1057

well. I guessed that you were
committed to me

1058
01:06:10.424 --> 01:06:13.210
or not commit-- But. like.
a little committed to me.

1059

1060
01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:18.258
you went home.
and then this weird loop

1061
01:06:18.345 --> 01:06:19.956
kept playing in my head

1063
01:06:22.175 --> 01:06:24.525

with some stud boyfriend

1064
01:06:24.612 --> 01:06:26.571
in high school.
and I kept thinking.

1065
01:06:26.658 --> 01:06:28.703
she's definitely gonna
hook up with this guy.

1066
01:06:28.790 --> 01:06:31.054
despite what's happening
between us.

1067
01:06:31.141 --> 01:06:33.752
and then you sent that--

1068
01:06:33.839 --> 01:06:36.973
that photo of your breasts.

1069
01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:38.713
and then you said
it was a mistake.

1070
01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:41.194
and I thought.

1071
01:06:41.281 --> 01:06:43.762
that's definitely for that
fucking total douche boyfriend.

1072
01:06:43.849 --> 01:06:46.199
and. you know.
you're probably considering

1073
01:06:46.286 --> 01:06:48.854
fucking him if you weren't
already fucking him.

1074
01:06:50.943 --> 01:06:53.685
And now I know that was...

1075
01:06:53.772 --> 01:06:56.470
obviously wrong. and I should've
just trusted you.

1076
01:07:00.866 --> 01:07:04.087
My former boyfriend
is asexual now.

1077
01:07:04.957 --> 01:07:08.613
as in doesn't want to have sex
with anyone ever again.

1078
01:07:09.962 --> 01:07:12.225
- Well. that's--

1079
01:07:14.271 --> 01:07:16.012
that's good to know. because I--

1080
01:07:16.099 --> 01:07:17.883
I think we're really
good together.

1081
01:07:19.754 --> 01:07:21.452
I mean. I had a good
time tonight.

1082
01:07:23.193 --> 01:07:24.411
Didn't you?

1083
01:07:24.498 --> 01:07:25.891
Yeah. I did.

1084
01:07:25.978 --> 01:07:28.372
- Yeah.
- Um. but I should...

1085
01:07:28.459 --> 01:07:30.287
probably go now.

1086
01:07:30.374 --> 01:07:32.593
N-no.

1087
01:07:34.204 --> 01:07:36.641
No. you got to stay over.
- I can't.

1088
01:07:36.728 --> 01:07:38.338
No. I'll make you scrambled
eggs in the morning.

1089
01:07:38.425 --> 01:07:41.950
Thank you. but. um.
my roommate will be worried.

1090
01:07:42.038 --> 01:07:43.430
- Oh. yeah?
- Yeah.

1091
01:07:43.517 --> 01:07:46.477
Right. Got to get
back to that dorm.

1092
01:07:46.564 --> 01:07:48.827
Yep. 'cause that's...
that's where I live.

1093
01:07:59.142 --> 01:08:00.621
Why don't you like me?

1094
01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:04.930
Why don't you like me?

1095
01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:08.847
Why don't you like me?

1096
01:08:11.067 --> 01:08:13.069
Answer me!
Why don't you like me?

1097
01:08:13.156 --> 01:08:15.506
Why don't you like me? Why?!

1098
01:08:21.686 --> 01:08:22.861
Here I am.

1099
01:08:25.385 --> 01:08:26.952
Hey.

1100
01:08:31.826 --> 01:08:33.785
Glad we got to go on our date.

1101
01:08:34.742 --> 01:08:36.309
Guess that was our date.

1102
01:08:37.528 --> 01:08:38.790
Okay.

1103
01:09:00.333 --> 01:09:01.987
Oh. God.

1104
01:10:14.494 --> 01:10:17.671
So... how was it?

1105
01:10:17.758 --> 01:10:19.238
Great. if you like a guy

1106
01:10:19.325 --> 01:10:21.719
that spends ten hours
a day on YouPorn.

1107
01:10:21.806 --> 01:10:24.504
So what was his go-to move.
the reverse squatting cowgirl?

1108
01:10:24.591 --> 01:10:25.810
Don't make me relive it.

1109
01:10:25.897 --> 01:10:27.638
Or that awful hand thing

1110
01:10:27.725 --> 01:10:29.379
where their fingers are.
like. moving so fast

1111
01:10:29.466 --> 01:10:30.771
that your vagina
starts to smoke?

1112
01:10:30.858 --> 01:10:32.425
- What is that?

1113
01:10:34.035 --> 01:10:36.212
Right now. I just have to
figure out what I'm gonna do.

1114
01:10:37.517 --> 01:10:38.736
Block his number.

1115
01:10:39.476 --> 01:10:41.217
That's a little harsh.

1116
01:10:41.304 --> 01:10:44.437
and even if I did ghost him.
how long till he got the hint?

1117
01:10:44.524 --> 01:10:46.831
Maybe his messages
will keep coming forever.

1118
01:10:46.918 --> 01:10:48.398
Maybe they'll never end.

1119
01:10:49.747 --> 01:10:51.357
Were his cats at least cute?

1120
01:10:53.751 --> 01:10:55.666
I never saw them.

1121
01:10:55.753 --> 01:10:56.928
Like. never?

1122
01:10:58.103 --> 01:11:00.323
Uh-oh. That's...

1123
01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:01.976
That's not good.

1124
01:11:02.063 --> 01:11:03.804
It is weird. isn't it?

1125
01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:06.981
Why would he lie
about having cats?

1126
01:11:07.068 --> 01:11:10.724
Because liking cats makes
a guy seem nonthreatening.

1127
01:11:10.811 --> 01:11:13.074
harmless. sensitive. even.

1128
01:11:13.161 --> 01:11:15.555
He lied because that's how
he wants you to think he is.

1129
01:11:17.775 --> 01:11:19.037
Think about it.

1130
01:11:19.124 --> 01:11:20.517
He's hiding something.

1131
01:11:31.702 --> 01:11:33.530
So fucking not.

1132
01:12:01.079 --> 01:12:02.689
One of us has to die.

1133
01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:29.673
Hey. Robert. my workload has
become really overwhelming

1134
01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:31.327
since I added
Pre-Columbian Histories

1135
01:12:31.414 --> 01:12:32.850
to my already packed schedule.

1136
01:12:32.937 --> 01:12:35.113
so I really need to focus
on my studies right now.

1137
01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:37.245
It's actually quite serious.
because my parents

1138
01:12:37.333 --> 01:12:38.899
have threatened
to "turn off the tap."

1139
01:12:38.986 --> 01:12:40.771
their words. unless I
keep up an A average.

1140
01:12:40.858 --> 01:12:43.382
Wait. I'm sorry.
have you had a stroke?

1141
01:12:43.469 --> 01:12:44.557
I know.

1142
01:12:44.644 --> 01:12:46.124
It's... it's too long.
I need to cut it.

1143
01:12:46.211 --> 01:12:48.387
Uh. yeah. you need to put us
all out of our misery

1144
01:12:48.474 --> 01:12:50.520
and just say.
"I'm not interested."

1145
01:12:50.607 --> 01:12:52.478
I can't say that. Taylor.

1146
01:12:52.565 --> 01:12:55.002
We had sex.
I have to say more.

1147
01:12:55.089 --> 01:12:57.962
- No. you don't.
- I do.

1148
01:12:58.049 --> 01:12:59.703
He's a nice guy.

1149
01:12:59.790 --> 01:13:01.444
sort of.

1150
01:13:01.531 --> 01:13:02.923
And what did he really
do that's so wrong

1151
01:13:03.010 --> 01:13:04.577
except be bad in bed

1152
01:13:04.664 --> 01:13:06.492
and maybe lie about having cats?

1153
01:13:07.624 --> 01:13:09.060
In a way. I kind of miss him.

1154
01:13:09.147 --> 01:13:10.975
Okay. my head
is gonna explode.

1155
01:13:11.062 --> 01:13:13.804
Not the real Robert. obviously.

1156
01:13:13.891 --> 01:13:16.067
but the guy I was texting
with when we first met.

1157
01:13:16.154 --> 01:13:17.938
I really liked that guy.

1158
01:13:18.025 --> 01:13:20.680
Yeah. it's easy to like
a text chain. It's not real.

1159
01:13:20.767 --> 01:13:22.595
Hey. I never opened
the video he sent me.

1160
01:13:22.682 --> 01:13:24.554
Great. now's your chance
to delete it.

1161
01:13:28.166 --> 01:13:29.602
<i>You're trembling.</i>

1162
01:13:29.689 --> 01:13:31.038
<i>I'm not trembling.</i>

1163
01:13:32.083 --> 01:13:33.650
It's sort of sweet.

1164
01:13:33.737 --> 01:13:35.434
It was the first movie
we saw together.

1165
01:13:35.521 --> 01:13:37.175
It's the only movie
you saw together.

1166
01:13:37.262 --> 01:13:38.785
He was really into this scene.

1167
01:13:38.872 --> 01:13:40.744
<i>I happen to like nice men.</i>

1168
01:13:40.831 --> 01:13:42.310
Leia's rocking
that mono-braid.

1169
01:13:42.398 --> 01:13:43.834
but my favorite
was always the side buns.

1170
01:13:43.921 --> 01:13:45.575
That's exactly what I said.

1171
01:13:45.662 --> 01:13:47.751
not that Robert
was remotely interested.

1172
01:13:49.622 --> 01:13:51.102
Oh. wait. there's more.

1173
01:13:51.189 --> 01:13:54.018
Wow. It's a montage.

1174
01:13:54.671 --> 01:13:56.847
- "Blade Runner"?
- Yeah. classic scene.

1175
01:13:56.934 --> 01:13:58.457
Rachael tries to run.
Deckard throws her

1176
01:13:58.544 --> 01:14:00.981
against the blinds.
forces her to say. "Kiss me."

1177
01:14:01.068 --> 01:14:02.592
and then shoves
his mouth on hers.

1178
01:14:02.679 --> 01:14:05.116
and then she falls in love.

1179
01:14:05.203 --> 01:14:06.422
Jesus.

1180
01:14:08.293 --> 01:14:10.426
"Last Crusade."
Indiana berates Elsa.

1181
01:14:10.513 --> 01:14:12.166
forces himself on her.
and then she says.

1182
01:14:12.253 --> 01:14:13.341
"How dare you kiss me?"

1183
01:14:13.429 --> 01:14:15.909
And then. of course.
she kisses him.

1184
01:14:17.955 --> 01:14:20.610
I guess this is just
Robert's idea of romance.

1185
01:14:27.094 --> 01:14:28.356
Taylor!

1186
01:14:28.444 --> 01:14:29.401
No. Taylor!

1187
01:14:30.837 --> 01:14:32.970
No. come on. Taylor.
this isn't funny!

1188
01:14:34.101 --> 01:14:36.147
Taylor. I'm so serious
right now.

1189
01:14:36.234 --> 01:14:39.324
I'm really. really. really.
really. really serious. Taylor!

1190
01:14:43.154 --> 01:14:44.503
You're welcome.

1191
01:14:47.854 --> 01:14:49.290
Oh. my God.

1192
01:14:52.076 --> 01:14:53.686
He's gonna read that.

1193
01:14:53.773 --> 01:14:55.296
It won't kill him.

1194
01:15:04.958 --> 01:15:06.307
You okay? What do you need?

1195
01:15:06.394 --> 01:15:07.439
I think I have a vape.

1196
01:15:07.526 --> 01:15:09.093
What are you doing?
We don't vape.

1197
01:15:10.050 --> 01:15:11.617
You're right. we don't.

1198
01:15:15.186 --> 01:15:16.492
You're sure you're okay?

1199
01:15:17.493 --> 01:15:18.798
Yeah. I'm fine.

1200
01:15:24.848 --> 01:15:26.545
Oh. my God.

1201
01:15:28.547 --> 01:15:30.462
You did this. You read it.

1202
01:15:30.549 --> 01:15:31.681
Okay.

1203
01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:35.249
Uh. okay.

1204
01:15:38.601 --> 01:15:39.776
"Okay. Margot.

1205
01:15:39.863 --> 01:15:42.430
I'm sorry you don't want
to see me anymore.

1206
01:15:42.518 --> 01:15:44.041
I hope I didn't do
anything to upset you.

1207
01:15:44.128 --> 01:15:45.521
You're a sweet girl.

1208
01:15:45.608 --> 01:15:47.523
and I really did enjoy
the time we spent together.

1209
01:15:47.610 --> 01:15:49.437
Let me know if you
change your mind."

1210
01:15:51.309 --> 01:15:52.440
That's it.

1211
01:15:53.398 --> 01:15:55.182
Margot. it's over.

1212
01:15:57.881 --> 01:15:59.665
Oh. my God. thank God.

1213
01:16:00.623 --> 01:16:01.754
You handled this well.

1214
01:16:02.494 --> 01:16:03.843
You're a good girl.

1215
01:16:04.583 --> 01:16:05.802
I'm sorry. Nope. sorry.

1216
01:16:05.889 --> 01:16:07.412
It's too soon. You're right.

1217
01:16:10.067 --> 01:16:13.940
Happy birthday
to you! Hey!

1218
01:16:14.027 --> 01:16:16.856
Happy birthday to you! Hey!

1219
01:16:16.943 --> 01:16:21.426
Happy birthday. dear Beth.

1220
01:16:21.513 --> 01:16:27.519
Happy birthday
to you.

1221
01:16:27.606 --> 01:16:29.303
I miss my bedroom.

1222
01:16:29.390 --> 01:16:30.914
- This is fun.
- Is it?

1223
01:16:31.001 --> 01:16:33.569
And look. there's no costumes
or mime makeup this year.

1224
01:16:34.091 --> 01:16:35.483
I could be a mime.

1225
01:16:35.571 --> 01:16:37.616
I'm trapped at a party.

1226
01:16:37.703 --> 01:16:39.749
Look. if you want
to go. just leave.

1227
01:16:39.836 --> 01:16:41.402
I heard that. No. no. no.

1228
01:16:41.489 --> 01:16:43.056
No one is leaving.

1229
01:16:43.143 --> 01:16:46.538
Dave's still setting up...
... the karaoke room!

1230
01:16:46.625 --> 01:16:48.801
Get ready.
- Taylor. what do you think?

1231
01:16:48.888 --> 01:16:50.760
You. me.

1232
01:16:50.847 --> 01:16:53.589
"The Confrontation"
from "Les Mis"?

1233
01:16:53.676 --> 01:16:54.851
We could sing it.

1234
01:16:54.938 --> 01:16:56.592
And you're shaking your head no.

1235
01:16:56.679 --> 01:16:58.681
- No.
- I di... Never mind.

1236
01:16:58.768 --> 01:17:01.248
Speaking of confrontations. though...

1237
01:17:01.335 --> 01:17:03.076
Taylor. why don't
you tell everybody

1238
01:17:03.163 --> 01:17:04.861
what you've been up to
with your forum thing?

1239
01:17:05.862 --> 01:17:08.212
Taylor has been weeding
out masked men

1240
01:17:08.299 --> 01:17:10.997
on her subreddit. the Vagenda.

1241
01:17:11.084 --> 01:17:13.217
Wait. wait. wait.
What's a masked man?

1242
01:17:13.304 --> 01:17:14.871
Ugh. James Madley.

1243
01:17:14.958 --> 01:17:16.916
Wait. did I tell you
that he started

1244
01:17:17.003 --> 01:17:18.918
this new subreddit
that he's calling. wait...

1245
01:17:19.005 --> 01:17:21.834
wait for it... Man Feminist.

1246
01:17:21.921 --> 01:17:24.663
James Madley? I know him.

1247
01:17:24.750 --> 01:17:26.491
He's a super chill guy.
He's in my comp lit.

1248
01:17:26.578 --> 01:17:27.927
And he's a Lyft driver.

1249
01:17:28.014 --> 01:17:30.060
Yeah. is he the orange car
that's always parked

1250
01:17:30.147 --> 01:17:31.539
outside the North Gate?
- The North Gate.

1251
01:17:31.627 --> 01:17:34.281
Well. that's kind of cute.
actually. isn't it?

1252
01:17:34.368 --> 01:17:37.110
You know. guys talking about
feminism with other guys?

1253
01:17:37.197 --> 01:17:38.285
- Mm.
- It's progress.

1254
01:17:38.372 --> 01:17:40.505
Is it. or is that
just blind dudes

1255
01:17:40.592 --> 01:17:42.507
leading even more blind dudes?

1256
01:17:42.594 --> 01:17:44.552
You should be a guest
moderator on his sub.

1257
01:17:45.379 --> 01:17:46.946
Yeah. and then they'd at least

1258
01:17:47.033 --> 01:17:49.166
have one female voice in there.

1259
01:17:49.253 --> 01:17:50.384
- Yeah.
- Progress.

1260
01:17:50.471 --> 01:17:51.908
Yeah. no. that's a great idea.

1261
01:17:51.995 --> 01:17:54.432
Let's just reward him for lying.

1262
01:17:54.519 --> 01:17:55.999
Really good idea. guys.

1263
01:17:58.523 --> 01:17:59.655
What?
- Okay. well.

1264
01:17:59.742 --> 01:18:00.873
if it's gonna be a mud fight.

1265
01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:02.266
I'm gonna need more booze.
- Yes. please.

1266
01:18:02.353 --> 01:18:03.571
- I'll come.
- You want one?

1267
01:18:03.659 --> 01:18:05.008
Yes. please. Yep.
Double shot. Thank you!

1268
01:18:05.095 --> 01:18:06.400
Yes. happy birthday.

1269
01:18:18.238 --> 01:18:19.326
The bar's that way.

1270
01:18:19.413 --> 01:18:21.111
It's him.

1271
01:18:21.198 --> 01:18:23.591
What? It's who?
Oh. my God. he really is old.

1272
01:18:23.679 --> 01:18:25.289
- No. don't look!
- Who? Him?

1273
01:18:25.376 --> 01:18:26.464
- Where?
- Don't look.

1274
01:18:26.551 --> 01:18:27.726
Oh. it's the guy at the theater.

1275
01:18:27.813 --> 01:18:28.771
Yeah. yeah. I told you about

1276
01:18:28.858 --> 01:18:29.815
that whole debacle. remember?

1277
01:18:29.902 --> 01:18:31.469
- Right.
- I don't know if he saw me.

1278
01:18:31.556 --> 01:18:34.733
Yeah. guy who said he had
cats and didn't have cats...

1279
01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:36.039
- Yeah.
- In the end.

1280
01:18:36.126 --> 01:18:37.736
- Look. I'm just gonna go.
- No. we'll all...

1281
01:18:37.823 --> 01:18:39.259
We're all gonna go. come on.

1282
01:18:39.346 --> 01:18:41.914
Come on. guys. Get up. Yes.
Come on. let's surround her.

1283
01:18:42.001 --> 01:18:43.481
Everyone just be subtle
and normal.

1284
01:18:43.568 --> 01:18:44.917
What?

1285
01:18:51.619 --> 01:18:53.143
Which one is he?

1286
01:19:14.817 --> 01:19:16.079
He saw me.

1287
01:19:21.606 --> 01:19:23.913
Ugh. this is just him
pissing on a lamppost.

1288
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.349
Ignore it.

1289
01:19:32.225 --> 01:19:33.357
This is so bad.

1290
01:19:33.444 --> 01:19:35.663

your fault.

And this was last night
after he sent the text

1303
01:24:00.928 --> 01:24:02.191
where he called you a whore?

1304
01:24:02.278 --> 01:24:03.583
Yeah. the text was last night.

1305
01:24:03.670 --> 01:24:05.281
and then tonight he harassed me

1306
01:24:05.368 --> 01:24:07.500
when he waited for me outside.

1307
01:24:07.587 --> 01:24:09.285
He waited?
I thought he drove off.

1308
01:24:10.416 --> 01:24:12.723
After standing there
for ten minutes.

1309
01:24:12.810 --> 01:24:14.246
Did he approach you?

1310
01:24:14.333 --> 01:24:16.901
Not physically.
but he could see me.

1311
01:24:18.816 --> 01:24:21.210
Actually. I'm not sure if he
could see me through the doors.

1312
01:24:21.297 --> 01:24:24.082
but he knows my hours. so...

1313
01:24:28.217 --> 01:24:30.219
You're gonna say he didn't
break the law.

1314
01:24:30.306 --> 01:24:32.525
- He didn't break the law.
- Okay.

1315
01:24:32.612 --> 01:24:34.179
but I also don't want to be
the next episode

1316
01:24:34.266 --> 01:24:35.572
of "Homicide Hunter."

1317
01:24:36.094 --> 01:24:38.836
"Harassing predator
singles out young woman.

1318
01:24:38.923 --> 01:24:41.491
pursues her.
cops ignore her complaints.

1319
01:24:41.578 --> 01:24:44.624
until she's found in a trash bin
behind the local Kroger's."

1320
01:24:45.886 --> 01:24:48.628
Or the story goes.

1321
01:24:48.715 --> 01:24:51.196
"Average Joe likes young pussy.

1322
01:24:51.283 --> 01:24:53.981
gets frustrated when she doesn't
like him back.

1323
01:24:54.069 --> 01:24:56.506
drinks too much.
calls her a bad name.

1324
01:24:56.593 --> 01:25:00.249
drives to her work to try
to plead his case. chickens out.

1325
01:25:00.336 --> 01:25:04.340
then figures next time.
he'll pick a less hot girl."

1326
01:25:05.167 --> 01:25:07.995
But if Robert actually
does do something

1327
01:25:08.083 --> 01:25:10.737
to break the law
and you can prove it.

1328
01:25:10.824 --> 01:25:12.217
come find me.

1329
01:25:12.957 --> 01:25:15.220
Stop watching "Homicide Hunter."

1330
01:26:20.459 --> 01:26:23.462
Well. can't say
I'm surprised to find

1331
01:26:23.549 --> 01:26:25.247
two lovely ladies
like yourselves

1332
01:26:25.334 --> 01:26:26.422
in here looking for protection.

1333
01:26:26.509 --> 01:26:29.207
Oh. my God. Kelvin?

1334
01:26:29.294 --> 01:26:30.774
You need to shut
that shit down right now.

1335
01:26:30.861 --> 01:26:32.645
Yeah. I'm in no mood
to be hit on

1336
01:26:32.732 --> 01:26:34.343
while my life
might be in danger.

1337
01:26:34.430 --> 01:26:35.605
I'm sorry.

1338
01:26:35.692 --> 01:26:37.259
Don't apologize.

1339
01:26:37.737 --> 01:26:38.869
Uh. okay.

1340
01:26:38.956 --> 01:26:42.177
Um. how can I help you?

1341
01:26:42.742 --> 01:26:44.657
I need to keep someone
away from me.

1342
01:26:44.744 --> 01:26:47.312
- Mm-hmm.
- And if he doesn't stay away.

1343
01:26:47.399 --> 01:26:48.792
I need to be able
to defend myself.

1344
01:26:48.879 --> 01:26:50.750
Mm-hmm. Yeah. All right.

1345
01:26:53.492 --> 01:26:54.624
How about a stun gun?

1346
01:26:54.711 --> 01:26:57.583
- And that just zaps him?
- Yeah.

1347
01:26:58.323 --> 01:27:00.717
The Vipertek VTS-989.
what we got here.

1348
01:27:00.804 --> 01:27:02.197
it's our best seller.

1349
01:27:02.284 --> 01:27:04.373
Fully rechargeable.
- Mm. no. that's not gonna work.

1350
01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:06.244
She's at 4% with her
phone on a good day.

1351
01:27:06.331 --> 01:27:08.899
All righty.
We could keep it simple. then.

1352
01:27:08.986 --> 01:27:10.901
Two words: Smith & Wesson.

1353
01:27:10.988 --> 01:27:12.772
- A gun?
- A gun. gun?

1354
01:27:12.859 --> 01:27:15.427
Kelvin. when you
go home at night.

1355
01:27:15.514 --> 01:27:17.081
what planet is that?

1356
01:27:17.168 --> 01:27:18.996
Do you realize that you're
more likely to get shot

1357
01:27:19.083 --> 01:27:22.042
if you're carrying a gun.
with your own gun?

1358
01:27:24.567 --> 01:27:28.701
Look. ladies. I just want
to help you both feel safe.

1359
01:27:28.788 --> 01:27:30.137
How can I do that?

1360
01:27:31.269 --> 01:27:33.750
I just need to know
if I'm overreacting

1361
01:27:33.837 --> 01:27:36.318
or if there really is a guy
out there after me.

1362
01:27:39.930 --> 01:27:41.975
At least this way.
we're ready for anything.

1363
01:27:44.151 --> 01:27:46.023
God. this is so intense.

1364
01:27:46.110 --> 01:27:48.721
Are you sure a tracking device
is even legal?

1365
01:27:48.808 --> 01:27:50.157
Kelvin said it depends
on the state.

1366
01:27:50.245 --> 01:27:51.855
Oh. we're quoting Kelvin now?

1367
01:27:51.942 --> 01:27:54.249
Taylor. I have
to do something.

1368
01:27:54.336 --> 01:27:57.208
And if Robert is out there
planning to hurt me.

1369
01:27:57.295 --> 01:27:58.818
I have to be able to stop him.

1370
01:27:58.905 --> 01:28:00.951
and to stop him.
I have to know where he is

1371
01:28:01.038 --> 01:28:02.257
at all times.

1372
01:28:04.302 --> 01:28:06.391
Right. but that just means

1373
01:28:06.478 --> 01:28:09.612
that you have to get
that thing on his car.

1374
01:28:10.917 --> 01:28:11.962
Yeah.

1375
01:28:12.963 --> 01:28:14.965
I have to get this thing
on his car soon.

1376
01:28:17.010 --> 01:28:18.360
Party!

1377
01:28:18.447 --> 01:28:19.926
- Motherfucker!
- I know. A hot dog.

1378
01:28:20.013 --> 01:28:21.101
it's horrifying.
Cecilia is having

1379
01:28:21.188 --> 01:28:22.494
a You Are What You Eat Party.

1380
01:28:22.581 --> 01:28:24.191
You gotta come.
- And we even got you costumes.

1381
01:28:24.279 --> 01:28:25.454
You almost gave us
heart attacks.

1382
01:28:25.541 --> 01:28:27.891
Which is so fucking rude.

1383
01:28:27.978 --> 01:28:30.197
You just barge in here.
taking up every inch of space

1384
01:28:30.285 --> 01:28:32.069
with your loud. entitled voices

1385
01:28:32.156 --> 01:28:34.114
and your obnoxious.
meaty costumes?

1386
01:28:34.201 --> 01:28:36.073
I was gonna be an avocado.

1387
01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:37.335
Taylor. we're fine.

1388
01:28:37.422 --> 01:28:38.815
They're just inviting
us to a party.

1389
01:28:38.902 --> 01:28:41.121
Did they ask if we wanted
to be invited to a party?

1390
01:28:41.208 --> 01:28:43.472
We are.
We... We are now.

1391
01:28:43.559 --> 01:28:45.300
Uh. we could...
Yeah. if you want to come.

1392
01:28:46.692 --> 01:28:48.955
I'm sorry. we were just
in the middle of something.

1393
01:28:49.042 --> 01:28:50.653
What? Don't apologize to them.
Why are you always

1394
01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:52.829
apologizing to dudes?
- Relax.

1395
01:28:53.525 --> 01:28:55.135
Why do you have to make
everything into some epic

1396
01:28:55.222 --> 01:28:57.529
battle in your own mind?
It's exhausting.

1397
01:28:57.616 --> 01:29:00.010
Kyle and Lucas didn't
do anything wrong.

1398
01:29:00.097 --> 01:29:02.099
Clearly. this is a bad time.

1399
01:29:02.186 --> 01:29:03.535
So we'll be in the lounge if...

1400
01:29:03.622 --> 01:29:04.928
- Sorry.
- Yeah. sorry.

1401
01:29:05.015 --> 01:29:07.234
We'll knock next time.

1402
01:29:07.322 --> 01:29:09.106
What the fuck was that?

1403
01:29:09.411 --> 01:29:10.499
What is going on?

1404
01:29:10.586 --> 01:29:12.327
Why are you always
against me recently?

1405
01:29:12.414 --> 01:29:14.329
Nobody is against you.

1406
01:29:15.242 --> 01:29:17.549
God. that's all
I'm saying. okay?

1407
01:29:17.636 --> 01:29:19.290
Good.

1408
01:29:19.377 --> 01:29:21.074
Although I'm also saying
that sometimes you make it

1409
01:29:21.161 --> 01:29:22.859
really hard for me
to be for you.

1410
01:29:22.946 --> 01:29:26.341
Oh. really? Oh. well.
I'm always there for you. so...

1411
01:29:26.428 --> 01:29:28.473
- What? No. you're not.
- I am.

1412
01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:30.040
I just took you
to get weapons.

1413
01:29:30.127 --> 01:29:32.564
Okay. let's be honest
about what I really am to you.

1414
01:29:33.304 --> 01:29:35.567
A pair of ears.
A captive audience.

1415
01:29:35.654 --> 01:29:37.526
- Are you joking?
- No.

1416
01:29:37.613 --> 01:29:39.615
You're only there for me
when I agree with you.

1417
01:29:39.702 --> 01:29:43.053
Th... It's... Without me.
you're literally just. like.

1418
01:29:43.140 --> 01:29:46.622
floating around in some
YA fantasy novel.

1419
01:29:46.709 --> 01:29:49.842
Like. I ground you.
Do you understand that?

1420
01:29:49.929 --> 01:29:51.801
I'm always trying
to protect you.

1421
01:29:51.888 --> 01:29:54.543
because I understand
the real world. and you don't.

1422
01:29:54.630 --> 01:29:56.371
What. from your virtual cave?

1423
01:29:56.458 --> 01:29:58.285
Where no one has real names?

1424
01:29:58.373 --> 01:30:00.113
Where no one's a real person
because you're all too afraid

1425
01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:01.680
to actually step out?

1426
01:30:01.767 --> 01:30:03.595
Oh. right.
like how you stepped out?

1427
01:30:03.682 --> 01:30:05.684
How'd that go for you?

1428
01:30:05.771 --> 01:30:07.643
At least I tried to connect
with another human.

1429
01:30:07.730 --> 01:30:09.558
What do you ever do except hide?

1430
01:30:11.211 --> 01:30:12.561
Fuck you.

1431
01:30:12.648 --> 01:30:13.997
This is bullshit.

1432
01:30:14.867 --> 01:30:17.217
Good luck with your
Robert problem. Margot.

1433
01:30:17.304 --> 01:30:18.610
Can't wait for that call.

1434
01:30:18.697 --> 01:30:20.046
Why would I bother calling?

1435
01:30:20.133 --> 01:30:21.831
You'll be too busy posting.

1436
01:30:26.226 --> 01:30:28.185
Fuck.

1437
01:31:54.445 --> 01:31:56.534
I don't want to talk to you.
but I left my charger

1438
01:31:56.621 --> 01:31:57.753
in your room.

1439
01:31:59.145 --> 01:32:00.407
Margot?

1440
01:32:09.591 --> 01:32:11.201
Oh. my God.

1441
01:33:04.210 --> 01:33:05.777
Hey. Hey. Who are you?

1442
01:33:07.866 --> 01:33:08.693
Hey.

1443
01:33:11.130 --> 01:33:12.262
What are you doing?

1444
01:33:13.132 --> 01:33:14.786
I know that dog.

1445
01:33:14.873 --> 01:33:15.961
Go. Go.

1446
01:33:18.747 --> 01:33:21.271
That dog was outside
my dorm weeks ago.

1447
01:33:23.490 --> 01:33:24.840
You've been following me.

1448
01:33:25.884 --> 01:33:28.017
I don't... I...
What is that?

1449
01:33:29.322 --> 01:33:31.586
What is that in your hand?

1450
01:33:33.022 --> 01:33:35.067
What is that in your hand?

1451
01:33:36.765 --> 01:33:37.983
Give it to me.

1452
01:33:52.607 --> 01:33:53.999
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

1453
01:33:54.086 --> 01:33:55.740
We need to go to the
Alphabet Streets immediately.

1454
01:33:55.827 --> 01:33:57.089
- Okay.
- There's this guy named Robert.

1455
01:33:57.176 --> 01:33:58.351
My friend is with him right now.

1456
01:33:58.438 --> 01:34:00.571
I-I don't know his address
or his last name.

1457
01:34:00.658 --> 01:34:02.442
but I just have a really bad
feeling about this. okay.

1458
01:34:02.529 --> 01:34:03.922
so we're just gonna
drive to the Alphabet Streets.

1459
01:34:04.009 --> 01:34:05.097
and we can start looking.

1460
01:34:05.184 --> 01:34:06.925
Okay. all right. all right. um.

1461
01:34:07.012 --> 01:34:08.144
all right. just breathe.

1462
01:34:08.231 --> 01:34:10.146
You might want to buckle up.

1463
01:34:11.538 --> 01:34:14.716
You know. my name's. uh...
my name's James. by the way.

1464
01:34:22.506 --> 01:34:23.550
Fuck.

1465
01:34:26.336 --> 01:34:28.773
What do I do? What do I do?

1466
01:34:34.649 --> 01:34:36.651
What the fuck
is the matter with you?

1467
01:34:37.826 --> 01:34:40.045
Why am I inside your house?

1468
01:34:40.132 --> 01:34:43.222
You were trying
to put a tracker on my car.

1469
01:34:43.309 --> 01:34:45.181
because apparently.
you want to see me in jail.

1470
01:34:45.268 --> 01:34:47.705
This is insane.
I'm just gonna go.

1471
01:34:47.792 --> 01:34:50.229
You're not gonna go.
You're not going anywhere.

1472
01:34:50.316 --> 01:34:51.796
not until I have a plan.

1473
01:34:51.883 --> 01:34:54.581
until I figure out
how to fix this total.

1474
01:34:54.669 --> 01:34:57.889
god-awful.
disastrous mess you put us in.

1475
01:34:59.978 --> 01:35:01.806
Everything is ruined now.

1476
01:35:01.893 --> 01:35:03.765
If I let you out of here
looking like that.

1477
01:35:03.852 --> 01:35:06.245
you're probably gonna get your
wish. and I'm gonna go to jail.

1478
01:35:06.332 --> 01:35:08.595
no matter what I say
about what happened here.

1479
01:35:11.468 --> 01:35:13.296
Everybody believes the woman.

1480
01:35:13.383 --> 01:35:15.777
- Trust me. they don't.
- Oh. no.

1481
01:35:15.864 --> 01:35:18.475
You want to see how much
of a liar you are?

1482
01:35:20.216 --> 01:35:23.306
"I told my parents this morning
they will meet you soon."

1483
01:35:23.393 --> 01:35:26.875
with a... an emoji face
blowing a heart kiss.

1484
01:35:27.832 --> 01:35:29.268
"Break is boring. Good news.

1485
01:35:29.355 --> 01:35:31.401
we'll be in same
zip code again soon."

1486
01:35:31.488 --> 01:35:32.402
with two thumbs up.

1487
01:35:32.489 --> 01:35:33.795
You remember sending that?

1488
01:35:33.882 --> 01:35:35.579
"Thank you for being
so kind last night.

1489
01:35:35.666 --> 01:35:37.363
You're my new favorite person."

1490
01:35:38.625 --> 01:35:40.932
"Today you were
my first text and my last.

1491
01:35:41.019 --> 01:35:43.892
Let's make this every day."
with three questions marks

1492
01:35:43.979 --> 01:35:46.372
and a blushing face
with little hearts.

1493
01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:51.029
I went through all the texts;
there's 156 texts

1494
01:35:51.116 --> 01:35:55.164
that say. "I'm into you.
Robert. I like you. Robert."

1495
01:35:57.949 --> 01:35:59.168
Why'd you say those things?

1496
01:35:59.255 --> 01:36:01.083
Why did you say them
if you don't mean them?

1497
01:36:01.170 --> 01:36:06.001
And why'd you let me blubber on
like some lovesick asshole

1498
01:36:06.088 --> 01:36:07.698
when you obviously loathe me?

1499
01:36:07.785 --> 01:36:10.353
- I don't loathe you.
- Stop lying!

1500
01:36:12.268 --> 01:36:13.530
What about you?

1501
01:36:14.183 --> 01:36:15.706
You were stalking me.

1502
01:36:15.793 --> 01:36:17.534
I was stalking you?

1503
01:36:18.013 --> 01:36:21.756
What. a guy can't see a pretty
girl and want to meet her?

1504
01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:25.194
Okay. yeah. I...
So I followed you.

1505
01:36:25.281 --> 01:36:27.283
but only so I could
run into you.

1506
01:36:27.370 --> 01:36:29.459
Is that... is that a bad thing?

1507
01:36:29.546 --> 01:36:31.374
I mean. is that a bad thing?

1508
01:36:31.461 --> 01:36:33.550
I-I... Am I some kind of bad guy

1509
01:36:33.637 --> 01:36:36.161
'cause I just want to--
I want to fucking meet a girl?

1510
01:36:36.248 --> 01:36:38.816
I want to meet a girl in life
and not on a fucking app?

1511
01:36:38.903 --> 01:36:40.513
I don't want to meet them
through my screen?

1512
01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:42.341
Am I such a bad guy?

1513
01:36:43.821 --> 01:36:46.215
I'm sorry that
I found you attractive.

1514
01:36:46.302 --> 01:36:48.913
and maybe if you'd liked me.
like I thought you did.

1515
01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.437
you would've found that romantic
and not. you know.

1516
01:36:51.524 --> 01:36:53.875
not creepy. and it could've
been our story.

1517
01:36:55.615 --> 01:36:56.703
What?

1518
01:36:56.791 --> 01:36:58.444
The fucking origin story

1519
01:36:58.531 --> 01:37:00.838
that our best man
would've told at our wedding.

1520
01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:04.581
And by the way.
you had your eye on me. too.

1521
01:37:04.668 --> 01:37:06.626
at the movie theater.
didn't you?

1522
01:37:08.150 --> 01:37:09.151
Be honest!

1523
01:37:09.891 --> 01:37:11.718
Just say it! Say it! Say it!

1524
01:37:11.806 --> 01:37:13.198
Don't play games.

1525
01:37:13.285 --> 01:37:15.897
Don't play games
anymore with me.

1526
01:37:16.245 --> 01:37:18.595
You can't say shit.
you can't say a goddamn

1527
01:37:18.682 --> 01:37:20.423
truthful thing
in your fucking life.

1528
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:22.077
Dumbass teenager.

1529
01:37:22.164 --> 01:37:25.428
You just fucking manipulated me.

1530
01:37:25.515 --> 01:37:26.777
I was honest.

1531
01:37:28.648 --> 01:37:29.954
At first.

1532
01:37:31.434 --> 01:37:32.783
But the night we spent here.

1533
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:36.656
we just had such different experiences.

1534
01:37:38.397 --> 01:37:40.051
Wh-what do you mean?

1535
01:37:40.486 --> 01:37:42.010
You had a bad time?

1536
01:37:43.359 --> 01:37:45.622
What? What... What did I do?

1537
01:37:45.709 --> 01:37:47.189
I didn't fuck you well enough?

1538
01:37:48.581 --> 01:37:49.974
You should've told me that!
Tell me!

1539
01:37:50.061 --> 01:37:51.497
Well. when you were
texting me after.

1540
01:37:51.584 --> 01:37:53.630
I was just trying
to spare your feelings.

1541
01:37:57.634 --> 01:37:59.331
Fuck.

1542
01:38:01.768 --> 01:38:03.379
I'm being way too loud.

1543
01:38:03.466 --> 01:38:04.641
I'm being way
too loud right now.

1544
01:38:04.728 --> 01:38:05.903
This is... This is not a--

1545
01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:07.035
Ugh. my eyes.

1546
01:38:07.905 --> 01:38:10.212
Oh. your eyes? Well.
that's also your fault entirely.

1547
01:38:10.299 --> 01:38:12.997
Please. can I just have
some water for my eyes?

1548
01:38:13.519 --> 01:38:15.739
You need saline solution.
not water.

1549
01:38:18.394 --> 01:38:21.397
Oh. my God. you've had
girls mace you before?

1550
01:38:22.354 --> 01:38:23.703
Go on. Go on.

1551
01:38:24.530 --> 01:38:26.576
What. so this
is a regular thing?

1552
01:38:27.620 --> 01:38:29.013
I'm a nurse.

1553
01:38:31.537 --> 01:38:34.192
Not that you ever
bothered to ask.

1554
01:38:34.932 --> 01:38:38.936
I don't know. maybe Ambien
mixed with Klonopin.

1555
01:38:39.328 --> 01:38:41.678
and I just dose you.
and I drop you off on campus.

1556
01:38:41.765 --> 01:38:43.941
and... and you don't
remember how you got there.

1557
01:38:44.028 --> 01:38:46.335
and it'd be as if this whole

1558
01:38:46.422 --> 01:38:48.119
hideous nightmare
never happened.

1559
01:38:49.294 --> 01:38:50.730
That's your plan?

1560
01:38:53.168 --> 01:38:54.909
That is not a good plan.

1561
01:38:54.996 --> 01:38:57.389
Well. because there
is no good plan.

1562
01:38:57.476 --> 01:38:59.174
There is no good plan.

1563
01:38:59.826 --> 01:39:02.003
If you walk out of here
looking like that.

1564
01:39:02.090 --> 01:39:04.135
it's over for me. right?

1565
01:39:04.222 --> 01:39:05.920
I cannot trust you.
- Yes. you can.

1566
01:39:06.007 --> 01:39:07.704
No. I can't!

1567
01:39:08.096 --> 01:39:09.532
Look. why don't we
make a pact?

1568
01:39:09.619 --> 01:39:11.360
- A pact?
- Yeah.

1569
01:39:13.101 --> 01:39:14.667
You let me go...

1570
01:39:17.148 --> 01:39:20.935
You let me go. I never speak
a word of this to anyone.

1571
01:39:21.239 --> 01:39:24.590
and we... we both forget
we ever knew each other.

1572
01:39:24.677 --> 01:39:25.940
Ha.

1573
01:39:27.289 --> 01:39:30.770
- That could work.
- No. No. No.

1574
01:39:32.468 --> 01:39:35.558
Robert. look. if you drug me
like some super predator...

1575
01:39:35.645 --> 01:39:36.951
Oh. God.

1576
01:39:37.038 --> 01:39:39.040
...they will lock
you up for good.

1577
01:39:45.133 --> 01:39:47.004
Oh. my God. my eyes.

1578
01:39:51.269 --> 01:39:52.879
They're burning.

1579
01:39:55.795 --> 01:39:58.755
Can I please just have
some of that solution?

1580
01:39:59.669 --> 01:40:02.324
Please. please.
I'm in so much pain.

1581
01:40:07.068 --> 01:40:08.504
Don't fucking move.

1582
01:41:06.605 --> 01:41:08.738
<i>911. what's your emergency?</i>

1583
01:41:09.304 --> 01:41:10.392
<i>Hello?</i>

1584
01:41:10.479 --> 01:41:11.567
No--

1585
01:41:12.698 --> 01:41:14.004
<i>Hello?</i>

1586
01:41:17.312 --> 01:41:18.313
Fuck.

1587
01:41:26.408 --> 01:41:28.018
Stop. Stop.

1588
01:41:39.029 --> 01:41:41.249
Shut up! Shut up!

1589
01:41:41.336 --> 01:41:42.728
Get in here!

1590
01:41:42.815 --> 01:41:44.165
Get over here!

1591
01:41:47.690 --> 01:41:49.692
Come here. Stop.

1592
01:41:52.869 --> 01:41:55.306
Shut the fuck up. Shut up!

1593
01:42:04.315 --> 01:42:05.882
Shut the fuck up.

1594
01:42:05.969 --> 01:42:07.971
Shut up! Shut--

1595
01:42:13.411 --> 01:42:14.412
Fuck!

1596
01:43:07.073 --> 01:43:08.162
Get off me!

1597
01:43:08.249 --> 01:43:09.641
Enough!

1598
01:43:40.455 --> 01:43:42.631
Hey! Hey!

1599
01:43:47.288 --> 01:43:48.202
Come on.

1600
01:43:49.464 --> 01:43:50.900
Come on! Come on!

1601
01:43:52.423 --> 01:43:54.120
Help! God!

1602
01:44:00.605 --> 01:44:01.867
The drain.

1603
01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:10.441
Come in.

1604
01:44:11.964 --> 01:44:14.140
Margot! Come in.

1605
01:44:15.577 --> 01:44:17.753
Are you fucking crazy?
You got to trust me!

1606
01:44:22.105 --> 01:44:23.019
Come on.

1607
01:44:24.150 --> 01:44:26.718
Trust me! Come on!

1608
01:44:41.951 --> 01:44:43.648
Open it! Hey!

1609
01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:45.563
Robert!

1610
01:44:45.650 --> 01:44:47.130
Let me in!

1611
01:44:47.739 --> 01:44:50.089
Robert! Let me in!

1612
01:44:56.357 --> 01:44:58.054
Okay. turn off Adams
onto Buchanan.

1613
01:44:58.141 --> 01:44:59.447
Then go down Cleveland.

1614
01:44:59.534 --> 01:45:01.492
Okay. what we looking for?

1615
01:45:01.579 --> 01:45:03.233
Oh. my God. there's a fire.

1616
01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:04.669
Wait. drive toward the fire!

1617
01:45:04.756 --> 01:45:06.889
What? Seriously.
drive toward it?

1618
01:45:19.249 --> 01:45:21.164
Is your friend in there?
- I don't know. I don't know.

1619
01:45:21.251 --> 01:45:23.122
I don't even know
if this is the right house.

1620
01:46:02.074 --> 01:46:03.728
We didn't find anyone.

1621
01:46:03.815 --> 01:46:06.165
No. she hasn't responded to my
texts or calls or anything.

1622
01:46:06.252 --> 01:46:07.950
Did... did you check
everywhere?

1623
01:46:08.037 --> 01:46:09.734
It's good news
we didn't find her.

1624
01:46:18.134 --> 01:46:19.309
Hey. Taylor.

1625
01:46:20.745 --> 01:46:22.138
Why don't you let me
take you home?

1626
01:46:24.706 --> 01:46:26.185
I won't... I won't charge you.

1627
01:46:29.667 --> 01:46:33.454
I think you might
already know me.

1628
01:46:37.066 --> 01:46:38.546
I'm BitchPerfect.

1629
01:46:42.637 --> 01:46:44.073
It's nice to finally meet you.

1630
01:46:46.684 --> 01:46:49.383
Hey. Chief. We found
something in the basement.

1631
01:46:50.079 --> 01:46:51.689
Margot?

1632
01:46:56.955 --> 01:46:57.956
All right.

1633
01:47:07.879 --> 01:47:09.228
We got a pulse!

1634
01:47:12.493 --> 01:47:14.146
On both of 'em!

1635
01:47:14.233 --> 01:47:15.626
Come on. let's get 'em up.

1636
01:47:25.549 --> 01:47:26.855
She's up.

1637
01:47:26.942 --> 01:47:28.247
Oh. thank God.

1638
01:47:28.334 --> 01:47:29.466
Hi.

1639
01:47:29.553 --> 01:47:31.337
I-I'm gonna go get your mom.

1640
01:47:31.425 --> 01:47:32.774
Uh. she took a Valium.

1641
01:47:32.861 --> 01:47:34.428
and she's sleeping
in the lounge.

1642
01:47:34.515 --> 01:47:37.169
She's so stressed about this.

1643
01:47:37.256 --> 01:47:38.606
It's really not about
Kelly right now.

1644
01:47:38.693 --> 01:47:40.782
Look. I'm-I'm gonna be
right back. Your mom...

1645
01:47:42.174 --> 01:47:44.438
your mom is gonna
be so relieved.

1646
01:47:44.525 --> 01:47:50.052
You know.
and I'm relieved too. obviously.

1647
01:47:54.796 --> 01:47:56.928
Hi. You're okay.

1648
01:48:25.174 --> 01:48:27.393
I don't know why
you want to look at this.

1649
01:48:27.481 --> 01:48:29.483
Robert Holt is taillights now.

1650
01:48:29.570 --> 01:48:31.963
Okay. he's gone.
It's done. It's over.

1651
01:48:35.445 --> 01:48:37.621
He quit his job
at the hospital.

1652
01:48:39.449 --> 01:48:41.886
The woman at the desk
said he moved to the coast.

1653
01:48:42.365 --> 01:48:44.454
didn't leave any
forwarding information.

1654
01:48:47.196 --> 01:48:49.024
Who knows if that's true
or not. though?

1655
01:48:50.068 --> 01:48:52.549
Maybe he told her to say that
in case I came looking.

1656
01:48:54.986 --> 01:48:56.771
One of these days.
you're gonna have to tell me

1657
01:48:56.858 --> 01:48:58.512
what really happened that night.

1658
01:49:05.823 --> 01:49:08.783
Come on. We're late
for pickleball. Let's go.

1659
01:49:13.091 --> 01:49:16.007
<i> Then.
out of the swamp's depths</i>

1660
01:49:16.094 --> 01:49:19.968
<i>again appears horrifying.
mysterious creatures.</i>

1661
01:49:20.055 --> 01:49:21.447
You've seen it. right?

1662
01:49:22.666 --> 01:49:24.015
- Me?
- Yeah. you know how.

1663
01:49:24.102 --> 01:49:26.278

1664
01:49:26.365 --> 01:49:27.845
and stuff like that?

1665
01:49:27.932 --> 01:49:30.456
Do you recommend
"The Apartment"?

1666
01:49:30.544 --> 01:49:32.110
Embarrassingly.
I haven't seen it.

1667
01:49:32.197 --> 01:49:34.373
You haven't seen it?
It's. like. a classic.

1668
01:49:35.287 --> 01:49:37.899
I mean. you know. they told me
that if you don't see it.

1669
01:49:37.986 --> 01:49:39.553
they're gonna fire you.
but you...

1670
01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:40.902
I think they show
it two nights.

1671
01:49:40.989 --> 01:49:42.381
so you still have tomorrow.

1672
01:49:42.468 --> 01:49:43.557
Well. thank you.

1673
01:49:43.644 --> 01:49:44.819
- Yeah.
- I'll get on that.

1674
01:49:44.906 --> 01:49:46.516
- No. you should.
- Mm-hmm.

1675
01:49:47.430 --> 01:49:50.041
<i> To gratify their
destructive desires.</i>

1676
01:49:54.306 --> 01:49:57.571
