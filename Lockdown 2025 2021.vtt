00:00:25.652 --> 00:00:28.320
How do you think
the world will end?

4
00:00:30.455 --> 00:00:33.191
If you knew the end
of the world was here.

5
00:00:33.225 --> 00:00:35.327
would you be at home
with your family

6
00:00:37.296 --> 00:00:39.599
in the only safe place you know?

7
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:42.702
Or thought you knew?

8
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.640
Or if the real enemy is
within the human heart.

9
00:00:50.242 --> 00:00:52.244
your own heart.

10
00:01:24.544 --> 00:01:26.278
Come on Crystal. really?

11
00:01:26.311 --> 00:01:28.146
Baby girl. come on.

12
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.816
How come you not using
the one next to your room?

13
00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:31.784
The toilet
is stopped up again. Dad.

14
00:01:31.818 --> 00:01:33.285
Oh. know what?

15
00:01:35.555 --> 00:01:36.421
Come on!

16
00:01:37.724 --> 00:01:39.324
When I win this lottery.

17
00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.165
Is it that time of
the month again?

18
00:01:48.668 --> 00:01:49.535
Shit.

19
00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:57.877
Oh!

20
00:01:58.911 --> 00:01:59.779
Man.

21
00:02:11.691 --> 00:02:14.694
Man. it's like.
nobody cut the same.

22
00:02:16.663 --> 00:02:19.297
Today your lucky day.

23
00:02:28.941 --> 00:02:29.809
Junior!

24
00:02:32.411 --> 00:02:33.680
Junior!

25
00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.957
Sleeping on the goddamn job.

26
00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:51.764
For when you awake.

27
00:02:54.433 --> 00:02:55.935
Get your lazy sorry ass up.

28
00:02:55.968 --> 00:02:57.335
What do you want from me?

29
00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:59.639
I want you to stop lying.

30
00:02:59.672 --> 00:03:01.841
Boy. didn't I tell you to put
my barbecue grill together?

31
00:03:01.874 --> 00:03:03.475
Yeah.

32
00:03:03.508 --> 00:03:05.778
Then why you tell me
you did when you didn't?

33
00:03:07.446 --> 00:03:08.313
See.

34
00:03:09.015 --> 00:03:09.982
No!

35
00:03:10.016 --> 00:03:11.383
- No!
- Yeah.

36
00:03:11.416 --> 00:03:12.284
No!

37
00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:14.887
Didn't know you
could move that fast.

38
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:16.488
Man. Dad. do you know how long

39
00:03:16.521 --> 00:03:18.858
it takes me to
upload this stuff?

40
00:03:20.425 --> 00:03:21.393
You know how long
it would take you

41
00:03:21.426 --> 00:03:22.260
to build my grill.

42
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.001
You know what. Junior?

43
00:03:29.035 --> 00:03:30.636
You don't finish shit you start.

44
00:03:31.804 --> 00:03:32.739
Look man.

45
00:03:34.774 --> 00:03:36.508
It's your grill.

46
00:03:36.542 --> 00:03:37.944
You know what?

47
00:03:37.977 --> 00:03:39.645
I pay the bills around
this place. Junior.

48
00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:41.379
That's my food you eat.

49
00:03:41.413 --> 00:03:43.315
My electricity you wasting.

50
00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:44.984
That's my toilet you shit in.

51
00:03:45.017 --> 00:03:47.787
but you can't do one
thing I ask you to do.

52
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.022
It's jackpot Sunday.

53
00:03:50.056 --> 00:03:51.557
I'm cueing.

54
00:03:51.591 --> 00:03:53.458
I want my goddamn grill built.

55
00:03:53.492 --> 00:03:54.359
Or what?

56
00:03:55.762 --> 00:03:57.362
Don't you tempt me.

57
00:03:57.395 --> 00:03:58.263
Don't tempt me.

58
00:04:02.101 --> 00:04:03.035
Don't you temp me.

59
00:04:06.038 --> 00:04:07.974
Don't you tempt me.

60
00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:10.843
And stop
slamming my doors.

61
00:04:37.435 --> 00:04:39.071
Who's that?

62
00:04:39.105 --> 00:04:41.506
Oh. uh. well. that's just
my brother's wife. Lupe.

63
00:04:41.541 --> 00:04:43.709
We're supposed to
get together today

64
00:04:43.743 --> 00:04:45.611
to start planning
for her baby shower.

65
00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:49.081
For lunch.

66
00:04:49.115 --> 00:04:50.917
Who be off they
goddamn mind banging

67
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.885
on my door this
time of the morning?

68
00:04:55.955 --> 00:04:57.790
Good morning. sir.

69
00:04:57.824 --> 00:04:59.725
Didn't they pass
a law banning y'all

70
00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:01.828
from preaching door to door?

71
00:05:04.864 --> 00:05:07.533
Babylon the great has fallen

72
00:05:08.901 --> 00:05:13.906
and on this day when
the moon has darkened

73
00:05:15.473 --> 00:05:17.143
and the stars have
fallen from the sky.

74
00:05:17.176 --> 00:05:19.645
a great panic from the Lord
shall come down upon them.

75
00:05:21.013 --> 00:05:23.115
So that each will
lay hold on the hand

76
00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:25.517
of his fellow

77
00:05:25.551 --> 00:05:28.921
and then every
man's sword shall be

78
00:05:28.955 --> 00:05:30.690
against his brother.

79
00:05:32.424 --> 00:05:34.026
Get off my porch
before I call the police.

80
00:05:36.662 --> 00:05:38.396
You've been warned.

81
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:39.799
The day of truth is here.

82
00:05:41.534 --> 00:05:43.035
Them your people.

83
00:05:52.645 --> 00:05:54.981
What you doing boy?

84
00:05:55.014 --> 00:05:57.183
Come here boy. what's
wrong with you.

85
00:05:57.216 --> 00:05:58.718
What. you done broke my TV?

86
00:06:00.186 --> 00:06:01.486
Hey. wait a minute. come here.

87
00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:02.889
you gettin' sick?

88
00:06:02.922 --> 00:06:04.422
Nah. just a little
something in my throat.

89
00:06:04.456 --> 00:06:05.858
Dreams are a reflection

90
00:06:05.892 --> 00:06:07.560
of the dreamer's inner world.

91
00:06:07.593 --> 00:06:09.528
Dreaming of death is common

92
00:06:09.562 --> 00:06:10.529
in people experiencing-

93
00:06:10.563 --> 00:06:11.731
- What else is on. Dad?

94
00:06:13.666 --> 00:06:14.834
Uh. nothing.

95
00:06:18.204 --> 00:06:19.404
I'm bored.

96
00:06:20.606 --> 00:06:22.041
Won't you go play outside.

97
00:06:22.074 --> 00:06:24.944
I don't have no
one to play with.

98
00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:28.147
Not yet.

99
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.045
Wait a minute. man. come on.

100
00:06:59.078 --> 00:07:00.713
You got your hands all wrong.

101
00:07:00.746 --> 00:07:04.750
Look. get your hands
on the seams. right?

102
00:07:04.784 --> 00:07:06.218
Get the ball up.

103
00:07:06.252 --> 00:07:09.487
Elbow pointed toward the
rim. right there. ready.

104
00:07:09.521 --> 00:07:10.488
Now push it.

105
00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:14.994
Yeah.

106
00:07:15.027 --> 00:07:18.965

Barbecued chicken!

110
00:07:43.889 --> 00:07:45.523
I know. right?

111
00:07:45.558 --> 00:07:47.960
Come on. man. we going inside.

112
00:07:49.628 --> 00:07:52.064
Why aren't
you all bouncy today?

113
00:07:53.866 --> 00:07:56.002
I'm just not really
in a bouncy mood.

114
00:07:56.035 --> 00:07:57.169
Oh. really?

115
00:07:57.203 --> 00:07:58.237
- Really.
- Okay.

116
00:08:00.006 --> 00:08:03.275
I just. well. I have something

117
00:08:03.309 --> 00:08:04.877

118
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.646
and I need you to be serious.

119
00:08:08.781 --> 00:08:13.786
Um. well. I'm missed my period.

120
00:08:55.995 --> 00:08:57.763
It's jackpot Sunday.

121
00:08:57.797 --> 00:08:59.198

payout in U.S. history.

One lucky winner will win $1
billion and counting folks.

124
00:09:06.238 --> 00:09:08.007
That's the count to be.

125
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.643
It's Lotto fever

Good evening.

130
00:09:19.652 --> 00:09:21.087
These pictures over my shoulder

131
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.755
are from Chelyabinsk in Russia.

132
00:09:24.156 --> 00:09:25.724
the same location
that a meteor hit

133
00:09:25.758 --> 00:09:27.760
back in 2013.

134
00:09:27.793 --> 00:09:29.795
The residents are
now experiencing

135
00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:31.764
another phenomenon called

136
00:09:31.797 --> 00:09:35.034
a super charged
electrical rainbow storm.

137
00:09:35.067 --> 00:09:36.402
Yes. you heard me right.

138

Hello. Ms. McGee.

00:09:54.153 --> 00:09:56.021
Hey. Marcos.

It's Lotto time.

155
00:10:09.802 --> 00:10:11.137
Did you see the sky outside?

156
00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:12.671
It looks kind of weird.

157
00:10:12.705 --> 00:10:14.373
Must be all the smog outside.

158
00:10:14.406 --> 00:10:17.076
Won't you quit now. sit

Hey. baby girl.

payout in U.S. history.

00:11:52.471 --> 00:11:54.039
Pops. why do you
hold onto that thing

190
00:11:54.073 --> 00:11:55.975
like it's precious from
"Lord of the Rings."

191
00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:00.980
Better than you
holding onto a job.

00:12:02.481 --> 00:12:05.784
You gonna do that
in front of company?

Well. I'm ready.

206
00:12:37.516 --> 00:12:39.885
ladies and gentlemen are-

207
00:12:46.892 --> 00:12:48.827
What is this?

208
00:12:52.498 --> 00:12:55.301
Come on. you gotta
be kidding me.

209
00:12:57.970 --> 00:12:58.837
Not now.

210
00:13:00.172 --> 00:13:02.474
What. come on. this
can't be a test.

211
00:13:02.508 --> 00:13:04.443
Settle down before
you hurt yourself.

212
00:13:04.476 --> 00:13:05.612
And they better
not be billing me

213
00:13:05.645 --> 00:13:06.879
for this shit. either.

214
00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:08.447
Relax pop.

Look.

216
00:13:12.051 --> 00:13:13.586
It's another one of
those Amber alerts.

217
00:13:27.166 --> 00:13:28.901
Man. it's on every channel.

218
00:13:28.934 --> 00:13:31.036
It's even on my tablet.

219
00:13:37.443 --> 00:13:38.911
This
is not a test.

220
00:13:38.944 --> 00:13:41.146
Repeat. this is not a test

221
00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.148
of the Emergency
Broadcast System.

222
00:13:44.483 --> 00:13:48.387
Under executive order 14962.

223
00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:51.223
a national state of
emergency has been declared

224
00:13:51.256 --> 00:13:53.492
by the President of
the United States.

225
00:13:53.526 --> 00:13:55.595
Is this some sort of a joke?

226
00:13:55.628 --> 00:13:57.029
Under article two.

227
00:13:59.465 --> 00:14:01.066
We're missing it.

228
00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.235
Martial law has been declared.

229
00:14:03.268 --> 00:14:05.237
Habeas corpus has
been suspended.

230
00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:06.673
Right to a trial by jury?

231
00:14:06.706 --> 00:14:08.140
Gone.

232
00:14:08.173 --> 00:14:09.007
Can they do that?

233
00:14:09.041 --> 00:14:10.342
They just did.

234
00:14:10.376 --> 00:14:11.377
A
mandatory 24-hour curfew

235
00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:12.945
has been issued.

236
00:14:12.978 --> 00:14:14.913
Stay in your homes.

237
00:14:14.947 --> 00:14:16.081
Looters will be shot.

238
00:14:16.115 --> 00:14:18.016
Shot?

239
00:14:20.953 --> 00:14:22.321
We're missing
it again. fix it.

240
00:14:22.354 --> 00:14:23.055
This
is not a test.

241
00:14:23.088 --> 00:14:24.022
Wait.

242
00:14:24.056 --> 00:14:25.023
It's on again.

243
00:14:25.057 --> 00:14:26.024
This is-

244
00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:48.447
Okay.

245
00:14:49.549 --> 00:14:50.650
Okay.

246
00:14:50.683 --> 00:14:52.284
It was just a power surge.

247
00:14:53.218 --> 00:14:54.654
Okay.

248
00:14:54.687 --> 00:14:55.655
Yeah. Mr. McGee.
it looks like one

249
00:14:55.688 --> 00:14:56.656
of those brownouts.

250
00:14:56.689 --> 00:14:59.358
Yeah. yeah. let's go.

251
00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.368
Okay. now what is this?

252
00:15:12.304 --> 00:15:15.307
It's like some
kind of a virus.

253
00:15:18.143 --> 00:15:19.445
All the lines are frozen.

254
00:15:21.146 --> 00:15:23.750
Okay. what could have happened

255
00:15:23.783 --> 00:15:25.685
that would have made them issue

256
00:15:25.718 --> 00:15:27.519
a nationwide state of emergency?

257
00:15:29.689 --> 00:15:31.023
Terrorist attack.

258
00:15:32.057 --> 00:15:33.392
It's the Illuminati.

259
00:15:33.425 --> 00:15:34.993
Junior!

260
00:15:35.027 --> 00:15:37.429
I'm telling you. look.

261
00:15:37.463 --> 00:15:39.465
the FEMA coffins.
it's the beginning

262
00:15:39.498 --> 00:15:40.399
of world genocide.

263
00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.537
Look. this is a false
flag operation. okay.

264
00:15:44.571 --> 00:15:46.238
"Black Ops" all the way.

265
00:15:47.607 --> 00:15:49.642
Out of chaos comes
new world order.

266
00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:51.711
It's the fourth Reich.

267
00:15:51.744 --> 00:15:53.312
Okay. you know what. stop it.

268
00:15:53.345 --> 00:15:54.781
Just stop it with all

269
00:15:54.814 --> 00:15:56.783
that YouTube conspiracy
theory bullshit. Junior.

270
00:15:56.816 --> 00:15:58.116
I'm sick of it.

271
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:59.552
Man. why is it bullshit. Pop?

272
00:15:59.586 --> 00:16:01.186
You know what. they
let you post. right?

273
00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:02.321
Yeah.

274
00:16:02.354 --> 00:16:03.590
Okay. then it's bullshit.

275
00:16:12.665 --> 00:16:13.533
Junior!

276
00:16:37.089 --> 00:16:38.457
Junior!

277
00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:39.358
Boy. you gonna
get yourself shot.

278
00:17:00.747 --> 00:17:01.848
There ain't a nickel
worth of sense

279
00:17:01.881 --> 00:17:03.181
between the three of y'all.

280
00:17:03.215 --> 00:17:04.349
Get back in this house!

281
00:17:10.155 --> 00:17:11.189
Spooky shit. huh?

282
00:17:27.607 --> 00:17:29.107

No. no. you promised
you wouldn't leave us.

00:17:50.863 --> 00:17:51.831
How's Evans?

286
00:17:51.864 --> 00:17:53.700
I'm worried.

287
00:17:53.733 --> 00:17:55.768
He's resting again. but
he's still got a high temp.

288
00:17:55.802 --> 00:17:58.303
I gave him something to
try and break the fever.

289
00:18:02.909 --> 00:18:05.645
What are you doing?

290
00:18:07.245 --> 00:18:08.648
Where are
the moon and stars?

291
00:18:08.681 --> 00:18:11.350

Oh. my God. oh. my God.

After all these years.
it's finally here.

320
00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:00.258
Like a thief in the night.

321
00:20:00.292 --> 00:20:00.960
No.

322
00:20:01.994 --> 00:20:03.428

some kind of chemical weapon?

341
00:20:48.741 --> 00:20:50.610

Cindy.

343
00:20:51.778 --> 00:20:53.646

out. her cell phone died.

345

00:23:15.655 --> 00:23:17.957
I'm a need you not
to be Junior tonight.

373
00:23:23.062 --> 00:23:24.030
What is that supposed to mean?

374
00:23:24.063 --> 00:23:26.933
You know what it mean.

375
00:23:30.903 --> 00:23:31.837
Okay. pray.

376
00:23:35.908 --> 00:23:36.776
I got you.

377
00:23:39.612 --> 00:23:40.478
Okay.

378
00:23:50.056 --> 00:23:52.091
Martial
law has been enacted.

379
00:23:52.124 --> 00:23:53.826
Stay in your home.

380
00:23:53.859 --> 00:23:56.529
Mandatory 24-hour
curfew is in effect.

381
00:23:58.965 --> 00:24:01.233
All we gotta do is sit tight

382
00:24:01.267 --> 00:24:03.202
until this is over.

383
00:24:03.235 --> 00:24:06.806
And what happens when
what's going on gets here?

384
00:24:06.839 --> 00:24:08.975
It ain't gonna never
get here. baby girl.

385
00:24:11.043 --> 00:24:14.213
They always let them burn
down they own neighborhood.

386
00:24:14.246 --> 00:24:15.781
Who is them. Dad?

387
00:24:17.183 --> 00:24:18.050
He means me.

388
00:24:18.985 --> 00:24:20.686
If the shoe fit.

389
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:21.687
you can wear that
motherfucker all the way home.

390
00:24:21.721 --> 00:24:22.822
Clarence.

391
00:24:22.855 --> 00:24:24.056
Don't Clarence me.

392
00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:25.591
Don't pay him any mind.

393
00:24:25.624 --> 00:24:27.660
You're not going
anywhere. Marcos. okay.

394
00:24:27.693 --> 00:24:29.061
You better not.

395
00:24:29.095 --> 00:24:30.796
Martial
law has been enacted.

396
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:32.098
Stay in your home.

397
00:24:32.131 --> 00:24:34.166
Mandatory 24-hour curfew.

398
00:24:36.602 --> 00:24:38.671
Stay in your home.

399
00:24:48.748 --> 00:24:50.783
Mom. what was Uncle
Glen talking about?

400
00:24:52.918 --> 00:24:54.220
I would have to get my Bible.

401
00:24:54.253 --> 00:24:56.989
Here we go with that bullshit.

402
00:24:59.925 --> 00:25:01.727
For you yourselves
know very well

403
00:25:01.761 --> 00:25:03.596
that God's day is coming.

404
00:25:03.629 --> 00:25:05.531
exactly as a thief in the night.

405
00:25:09.635 --> 00:25:11.303
It will be instantly upon them.

406
00:25:11.337 --> 00:25:14.273
just as the pangs of
distress of a pregnant woman.

407
00:25:18.677 --> 00:25:19.912
And they will not escape.

408
00:25:28.888 --> 00:25:30.856
Martial
law has been enacted.

409
00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:32.658
Stay in your homes.

410
00:25:32.691 --> 00:25:35.961
A mandatory 24-hour
curfew is in effect.

411
00:25:37.396 --> 00:25:40.666
Mom. do you think
this is from God?

412
00:25:45.738 --> 00:25:48.240
I think that as
long as we stay inside

413
00:25:48.274 --> 00:25:51.243
and together. we're safe.

414
00:25:53.112 --> 00:25:54.647
That's one thing your
crack head brother got right.

415
00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.390
You never could cut
him any slack. could you?

416
00:26:04.423 --> 00:26:07.293
Not when he got his life
together. got married.

417
00:26:07.326 --> 00:26:10.329
bought a home. became
a longshoreman.

418
00:26:12.031 --> 00:26:13.365
Once an addict.
always an addict.

419
00:26:15.167 --> 00:26:17.670
Yeah. and you'd know
about that. wouldn't you.

420
00:26:17.703 --> 00:26:19.171
He didn't have to come by here

421
00:26:19.205 --> 00:26:20.806
and warn us. you know.

422
00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:24.076
He has his own family
to worry about.

423
00:26:26.679 --> 00:26:28.647
That nigga stole my TV.

424
00:26:43.162 --> 00:26:44.997
What happens when
it reaches zero?

425
00:27:02.882 --> 00:27:04.216
How's he doing?

426
00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:05.851
He's burning up.

427
00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:11.824
I think we should
get him to a doctor.

428
00:27:11.857 --> 00:27:12.725
Yeah.

429
00:27:14.093 --> 00:27:17.696
Little man's hot. okay.
come on. let's go.

430
00:27:21.767 --> 00:27:23.302
Oh. there go the Martinezes.

431
00:27:23.335 --> 00:27:25.171
Man. they pack fast.

432
00:27:26.739 --> 00:27:28.274
They got their whole
house on they car.

433
00:27:28.307 --> 00:27:30.342
We'd be leaving.
too. if we were smart.

434
00:27:31.443 --> 00:27:33.245
To where?

435
00:27:33.279 --> 00:27:35.247
I don't know. but
sitting here is just dumb.

436
00:27:35.281 --> 00:27:36.448
We should just go
check on your family

437
00:27:36.482 --> 00:27:38.083
and then head to Uncle Glen's.

438
00:27:39.218 --> 00:27:40.786
Oh. oh.

439
00:27:40.819 --> 00:27:43.055
Mr. Martinez is
getting out his car.

440
00:27:43.088 --> 00:27:44.723
Somebody 'bout to get
cussed out in Spanglish.

441
00:27:53.866 --> 00:27:55.434
We gotta get
him to a hospital.

442
00:27:55.467 --> 00:27:56.902
Where's my keys?

443
00:27:59.438 --> 00:28:01.006
Oh. shit!

444
00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.107
Oh. shit. man. they
just shot Mr. Martinez.

445
00:28:02.141 --> 00:28:03.242
Who did?

446
00:28:03.275 --> 00:28:04.310
Whoever he was arguing with.

447
00:28:07.012 --> 00:28:08.781
Shit. no. man. he just
shot him in the head.

448
00:28:08.814 --> 00:28:10.316
Call the police.

449
00:28:10.349 --> 00:28:11.483
Get away from the window.

450
00:28:11.517 --> 00:28:12.952
Get your ass away.

451
00:28:12.985 --> 00:28:14.987
Get out of the car!

452
00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:17.056
Ortiz. get the
fuck outta the car.

453
00:28:22.194 --> 00:28:23.929
They still in there.

454
00:28:30.102 --> 00:28:30.970
Junior.

455
00:28:32.404 --> 00:28:34.073
- What's wrong you?
- Dad!

456
00:28:34.106 --> 00:28:37.076
No. Junior. do you
want that to be us?

457
00:28:39.245 --> 00:28:42.549
Do you want that
to be us out there?

458
00:28:42.582 --> 00:28:43.449
Us.

459
00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:52.057
Come here.

460
00:28:53.993 --> 00:28:55.794
Stay down. stay down.

461
00:28:57.463 --> 00:28:58.464
Get in here.

462
00:28:59.566 --> 00:29:00.432
Get down.

463
00:29:04.303 --> 00:29:05.237
Get down.

464
00:29:12.177 --> 00:29:14.113
We gotta stay away
from the windows.

465
00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:23.322
We not going anywhere.

466
00:29:23.355 --> 00:29:24.223
What?

467
00:30:07.266 --> 00:30:08.434
Do you hear that?

468
00:30:08.467 --> 00:30:09.335
What?

469
00:30:11.671 --> 00:30:12.539
Mom?

470
00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:14.506
Dad?

471
00:30:34.694 --> 00:30:35.894
Do you hear that?

472
00:30:36.596 --> 00:30:38.163
They're gone.

473
00:30:38.197 --> 00:30:40.499
The helicopters. the sirens.

474
00:30:41.433 --> 00:30:43.035
It's really over?

475
00:30:43.068 --> 00:30:45.204
That's what I'm
talking 'bout. see?

476
00:30:45.237 --> 00:30:47.139
Police got everything
under control.

477
00:30:47.172 --> 00:30:49.208
Now everything'll be
back to normal soon.

478
00:30:49.241 --> 00:30:50.342
Now it's time to find out

479
00:30:50.376 --> 00:30:52.978
the numbers to the jackpot.

480
00:30:53.011 --> 00:30:54.913
I told y'all what today is.

481
00:30:54.947 --> 00:30:56.949
Is that seriously
all you care about?

482
00:31:02.354 --> 00:31:03.455
No.

483
00:31:03.489 --> 00:31:04.557
You know what else I care about?

484
00:31:05.592 --> 00:31:06.458
These ribs.

485
00:31:11.497 --> 00:31:12.632
And this corn.

486
00:31:14.433 --> 00:31:16.636
What if the countdown
was to mark an event?

487
00:31:18.203 --> 00:31:20.139
Yeah. but what kind of event?

488
00:31:21.206 --> 00:31:23.342
Yeah. yeah. the black Watson

489
00:31:23.375 --> 00:31:25.210
and the Latino
Sherlock Holmes now.

490
00:31:25.244 --> 00:31:27.714
is that what this is?

491
00:31:27.747 --> 00:31:28.947
Racist.

492
00:31:30.249 --> 00:31:32.217
I'm black. how
can I be racist.

493
00:31:32.251 --> 00:31:34.386
Duh. by being racist.

494
00:31:37.757 --> 00:31:38.625
No!

495
00:31:42.394 --> 00:31:43.996
Okay.

496
00:31:44.029 --> 00:31:45.464
Okay. I'm not sure
why I did that.

497
00:31:46.733 --> 00:31:48.400
Evan.

498
00:31:48.434 --> 00:31:50.302
Evan was the only
one who ate. right?

499
00:31:52.037 --> 00:31:53.606
Did anybody else
eat anything yet?

500
00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.642
I mean. what if
it was in the food

501
00:31:55.675 --> 00:31:56.643
or with the water?

502
00:31:56.676 --> 00:31:58.010
What was in the water?

503
00:31:58.043 --> 00:31:58.711
The poison.

504
00:31:59.712 --> 00:32:01.146
I mean the attack.

505
00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:02.981
The neighbor with the gas mask.

506
00:32:03.015 --> 00:32:04.349
Yeah?

507
00:32:04.383 --> 00:32:06.452
The only way to
carry out a mass attack

508
00:32:06.485 --> 00:32:08.420
would be through the
food or the water.

509
00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:12.291
Everything else would be.

510
00:32:12.324 --> 00:32:14.326
it would be too
limited. you know.

511
00:32:14.359 --> 00:32:15.494
He's right.

512
00:32:15.528 --> 00:32:16.629
It's better than putting cyanide

513
00:32:16.663 --> 00:32:18.397
in the Kool-Aid.

514
00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:19.732
I mean. you can
potentially kill millions

515
00:32:19.766 --> 00:32:21.333
with the right toxins.

516
00:32:30.409 --> 00:32:31.343
He is right.

517
00:32:31.376 --> 00:32:32.478
Daddy?

518
00:32:32.511 --> 00:32:34.079
What are you doing?

519
00:32:34.112 --> 00:32:36.081
Clarence. have
you lost your mind?

520
00:32:36.114 --> 00:32:37.416
You know who doing this?

521
00:32:37.449 --> 00:32:38.417
What are you talking about?

522
00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:39.485
Are you one of them?

523
00:32:42.254 --> 00:32:43.656
If I knew something.

524
00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:44.591
you think I would
be sitting here?

525
00:32:47.226 --> 00:32:48.695
Mom. please stop him.

526
00:32:50.295 --> 00:32:53.365
Clarence. you're
scaring everyone.

527
00:32:55.267 --> 00:32:59.171
I don't know what
you're talking about.

528
00:33:46.786 --> 00:33:48.453
Where they going?

529
00:33:49.354 --> 00:33:50.422
They leaving.

530
00:33:52.559 --> 00:33:54.493
Looks like we just
became them. Dad.

531
00:34:13.646 --> 00:34:14.547
Who's out there?

532
00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:22.655
I know for damn sure
you know something

533
00:34:23.723 --> 00:34:24.323
about who's part of this.

534
00:34:28.427 --> 00:34:32.297
Mr. McGee. I'm guessing
like everyone else.

535
00:34:32.331 --> 00:34:33.432
You're a liar.

536
00:34:35.167 --> 00:34:36.569
You know how I know you lying?

537
00:34:37.937 --> 00:34:42.542
'Cause a liar knows
a liar and you lying.

538
00:34:46.244 --> 00:34:47.914
Pop. come on. man.

539
00:34:47.947 --> 00:34:49.682
Marcos doesn't have any
reason to lie. all right.

540
00:34:49.716 --> 00:34:51.918
He's got a full
scholarship to USC

541
00:34:51.951 --> 00:34:54.519
and I mean. he's the
smartest kid on the block.

542
00:34:54.554 --> 00:34:57.155
Yeah. but I know
he know something.

543
00:34:57.189 --> 00:34:58.758
No. let him go.

544
00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:02.194
You've gone too far.

545
00:35:03.596 --> 00:35:05.464
And he better start
telling it right now.

546
00:35:05.497 --> 00:35:08.467
I don't know
anything. dammit. come on.

547
00:35:09.535 --> 00:35:11.203
Dad. listen. please stop.

548
00:35:11.236 --> 00:35:13.205
No. no. no. Marcos
is. I'm pregnant.

549
00:35:15.675 --> 00:35:16.508
What?

550
00:35:16.542 --> 00:35:17.710
Dios mio.

551
00:35:17.744 --> 00:35:19.177
Crystal Marie.

552
00:35:19.211 --> 00:35:20.412
You?

553
00:35:20.445 --> 00:35:21.848
I'll blow your fuckin' head off.

554
00:35:21.881 --> 00:35:23.315
Dad. stop. please.

555
00:35:23.348 --> 00:35:24.951
Stay back.

556
00:35:24.984 --> 00:35:26.451
Dad.

557
00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:42.835
It started off as whispers.

558
00:36:02.722 --> 00:36:04.590
You better start
talking right now.

559
00:36:10.763 --> 00:36:12.665
They call themselves VOTV.

560
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.301
Voices of the Voiceless.

561
00:36:17.704 --> 00:36:19.706
Yeah. I heard of them.

562
00:36:19.739 --> 00:36:21.674
New Age religious hacker group.

563
00:36:23.475 --> 00:36:25.310
These are some pill poppin'.
weed smokin' anarchists

564
00:36:25.343 --> 00:36:26.546
ready to start some shit.

565
00:36:29.615 --> 00:36:31.416
I went to a meeting once.

566
00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:32.919
What? You got
invited to a meeting?

567
00:36:32.952 --> 00:36:34.554
You lucky.

568
00:36:34.587 --> 00:36:35.955
Yeah. they're
like all the rest

569
00:36:35.988 --> 00:36:38.658
of the political hounds
pimpin' the system.

570
00:36:38.691 --> 00:36:40.560
Nah. Mr. McGee. you
got it all twisted.

571
00:36:40.593 --> 00:36:43.663
See. these. these were no suits

572
00:36:43.696 --> 00:36:46.966
shaking down corporate
America for handouts.

573
00:36:46.999 --> 00:36:48.701
These were revolutionaries.

574
00:36:49.969 --> 00:36:51.269
a network of old school hippies

575
00:36:51.303 --> 00:36:53.405
that didn't cut their hair.

576
00:36:53.438 --> 00:36:55.407
Vatos who kept the
lokes and tats.

577
00:36:57.043 --> 00:36:59.612
Crypts and Bloods who never
stopped sagging they hat.

578
00:37:01.513 --> 00:37:03.716
Engineers. chemists.
drug lords. teachers.

579
00:37:05.051 --> 00:37:06.719
The dude standing
outside of Home Depot.

580
00:37:08.688 --> 00:37:10.790
They talked about an event
that would change the world.

581
00:37:10.823 --> 00:37:12.892
I didn't know what
they meant then.

582
00:37:15.027 --> 00:37:16.428
But I think I do now.

583
00:37:17.797 --> 00:37:19.899
So you saying this
countdown is what?

584
00:37:19.932 --> 00:37:21.333
Some kind of death clock?

585
00:37:22.668 --> 00:37:24.670
If anybody could
pull this off.

586
00:37:24.704 --> 00:37:26.572
it would be these guys.

587
00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:30.509
Yeah. I mean they
brought down the CIA site.

588
00:37:30.543 --> 00:37:32.645
held it for like 32 minutes.

589
00:37:32.678 --> 00:37:35.014
It leaked like 10 years
of classified information

590
00:37:35.047 --> 00:37:36.983
all over the web.

591
00:37:37.016 --> 00:37:37.884
Shit.

592
00:37:39.351 --> 00:37:41.386
Now. I don't know. but

593
00:37:42.722 --> 00:37:44.824
I remember they'd
always say one thing.

594
00:37:47.627 --> 00:37:48.493
It's coming.

595
00:37:52.098 --> 00:37:53.065
I'll be back.

596
00:37:53.099 --> 00:37:54.399
Where are you going?

597
00:37:54.432 --> 00:37:55.400
I gotta check on my family.

598
00:37:55.433 --> 00:37:56.836
I can get some answers.

599
00:37:56.869 --> 00:37:58.370
No. no. no. I'm
gonna come with you.

600
00:37:58.403 --> 00:38:00.840
No. you're not.

601
00:38:09.115 --> 00:38:11.083
It's too dangerous
for us out there.

602
00:38:13.019 --> 00:38:13.886
I love you.

603
00:38:14.821 --> 00:38:16.388
I love you. too.

604
00:38:27.133 --> 00:38:28.000
Wait.

605
00:38:44.717 --> 00:38:49.722
Now.

606
00:38:50.656 --> 00:38:51.791
I'll be back. I promise.

607
00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:20.052
Why didn't you wait until
you finished college first

608
00:39:20.086 --> 00:39:21.787
like we talked about?

609
00:39:21.821 --> 00:39:23.089
Why did we bother to
get the fucking pills

610
00:39:23.122 --> 00:39:24.522
if you were just gonna...

611
00:39:28.961 --> 00:39:30.596
Yeah. okay. she's pregnant.

612
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:32.430
So what.

613
00:39:32.464 --> 00:39:33.900
I think we got bigger
things to worry about. Pop.

614
00:39:33.933 --> 00:39:36.434
like what's gonna happen
in the next 30 minutes.

615
00:39:38.104 --> 00:39:39.906
I would expect that out
of a lame brain like you.

616
00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:46.545
Your future is so bright.

617
00:39:46.579 --> 00:39:48.080
Marcos is a good
buy. I know that.

618
00:39:48.114 --> 00:39:50.049
but you have your whole
life ahead of you.

619
00:39:50.082 --> 00:39:51.416
Do I. Mom?

620
00:39:54.987 --> 00:39:56.722
Hear me out. baby girl.

621
00:39:59.558 --> 00:40:00.660
Life is like a puzzle.

622
00:40:03.529 --> 00:40:05.031
It's played one piece at a time.

623
00:40:06.632 --> 00:40:09.769
Daddy. I get that.
but it's my puzzle.

624
00:40:10.703 --> 00:40:11.570
Okay.

625
00:40:12.638 --> 00:40:14.573
But. some of these pieces.

626
00:40:14.607 --> 00:40:16.142
you only get one chance to play

627
00:40:17.877 --> 00:40:21.047
and how you play them affects
the rest of your life.

628
00:40:22.915 --> 00:40:25.117
Is this what you really want?

629
00:40:27.887 --> 00:40:28.988
I just don't want you to make

630
00:40:29.021 --> 00:40:30.723
the same mistake I did. sweetie.

631
00:40:31.791 --> 00:40:32.658
Mom. I'm not.

632
00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:35.528
I love Marcos.

633
00:40:37.964 --> 00:40:39.497
What you trying to say?

634
00:40:39.532 --> 00:40:41.567
Your mother and I
don't love one another?

635
00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:40.026
It's like a war out there.

636
00:41:47.967 --> 00:41:48.868
I'll take over.

637
00:42:11.824 --> 00:42:12.758
Hi.

638
00:42:14.126 --> 00:42:16.228
So I'm gonna be Uncle Evan?

639
00:42:20.332 --> 00:42:21.834
How did you know that?

640
00:42:23.369 --> 00:42:26.605
Y'all were fighting
and screaming loud.

641
00:42:26.639 --> 00:42:28.207
Shouldn't everyone be happy

642
00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:29.308
you're having a baby?

643
00:42:35.781 --> 00:42:37.850
I promise to share

644
00:42:37.883 --> 00:42:40.386
and show him how to
count to a hundred

645
00:42:40.419 --> 00:42:42.721
and teach him his ABCs.

646
00:42:44.824 --> 00:42:47.193
Well. what if he is a she?

647
00:42:47.226 --> 00:42:49.261
Then I will teach her. too.

648
00:42:49.295 --> 00:42:52.998
I just wanna be a
good uncle. the best.

649
00:42:54.066 --> 00:42:56.769
You'll do fine. I promise.

650
00:42:59.305 --> 00:43:01.674
He's still running a fever.

651
00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:05.678
Dad. it's hot in here.

652
00:43:05.711 --> 00:43:06.879
It's all right man.

653
00:43:06.912 --> 00:43:09.348
just stay laying
down. all right.

654
00:43:11.083 --> 00:43:13.219
I'm gonna take him
upstairs where it's cooler.

655
00:43:13.252 --> 00:43:15.354
I got it. Mom. it's fine.

656
00:43:15.387 --> 00:43:17.089
Okay.

657
00:43:17.123 --> 00:43:17.990
Thanks.

658
00:43:30.736 --> 00:43:32.037
Pops.

659
00:43:32.071 --> 00:43:33.939
What about the
generator you bought?

660
00:43:35.241 --> 00:43:36.742
What generator?

661
00:43:36.775 --> 00:43:38.444
The one from Y2K.

662
00:43:38.477 --> 00:43:41.380
It's brand new. still in
the box. never used it.

663
00:43:41.413 --> 00:43:42.948
Remember back when you believed

664
00:43:42.982 --> 00:43:44.283
in conspiracy theories.

665
00:43:44.316 --> 00:43:46.352
Yeah. but that was different.

666
00:43:46.385 --> 00:43:47.253
How?

667
00:43:49.021 --> 00:43:50.856
Let's go get this
gennie. come on.

668
00:43:50.890 --> 00:43:53.893
Oh. no. no. no. no. I don't
want you going out there.

669
00:43:53.926 --> 00:43:56.695
Somehow we gotta
find out what's going on.

670
00:43:57.963 --> 00:43:59.798
Yeah. Pops is right.

671
00:43:59.832 --> 00:44:02.034
It'll be all right. Mom.
we'll be right back.

672
00:44:32.198 --> 00:44:34.066
You know where it is?

673
00:44:34.099 --> 00:44:36.001
How am I supposed
to know that?

674
00:44:37.136 --> 00:44:38.070
Really?

675
00:44:40.172 --> 00:44:41.774
Shit.

676
00:44:41.807 --> 00:44:43.075
You bought it.

677
00:44:52.985 --> 00:44:54.220
All these boxes
packed up on top

678
00:44:54.253 --> 00:44:55.854
of one another.

679
00:44:55.888 --> 00:44:58.123
I thought I told you to
clean this place out?

680
00:44:58.157 --> 00:44:59.358
Man. this always
turns into something

681
00:44:59.391 --> 00:45:00.960
about me. man.

682
00:45:00.993 --> 00:45:02.094
I was just waiting on you.

683
00:45:02.127 --> 00:45:04.196
Hey. boy. be quiet.

684
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:07.233
You always poppin'
off at the mouth.

685
00:45:14.006 --> 00:45:14.873
I'm sorry.

686
00:45:16.875 --> 00:45:17.743
What?

687
00:45:19.011 --> 00:45:19.878
You're right.

688
00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:22.848
I've been blaming you

689
00:45:22.881 --> 00:45:24.350
and you've been helping
me out a lot tonight

690
00:45:24.383 --> 00:45:26.518
and I'm really
proud of you. man.

691
00:45:26.553 --> 00:45:27.753
I mean that.

692
00:45:29.455 --> 00:45:32.224
It must be the
end of the world.

693
00:45:32.258 --> 00:45:35.361
See? That's that
bullshit right there.

694
00:45:36.895 --> 00:45:37.863
It's cool. Pop.

695
00:45:43.536 --> 00:45:44.503
Oh. hold up.

696
00:45:45.838 --> 00:45:48.874
Hey. this is a CB radio. right.

697
00:45:48.907 --> 00:45:50.242
We might be able to use this.

698
00:45:57.550 --> 00:45:59.918
Aw. sugar. sugar now.

699
00:45:59.952 --> 00:46:02.521
Pops. you thought
you had swag. huh?

700
00:46:03.455 --> 00:46:04.490
I still got swag.

701
00:46:16.235 --> 00:46:19.505
Maybe it's
up in this corner.

702
00:46:26.078 --> 00:46:27.479
You find anything?

703
00:46:37.189 --> 00:46:38.057
Wow.

704
00:46:50.369 --> 00:46:51.538
What you laughing at?

705
00:46:51.571 --> 00:46:53.573
Nothing. keep looking.

706
00:47:03.449 --> 00:47:05.451
Oh. found it.

707
00:47:23.268 --> 00:47:25.437
Did you know your
sister was pregnant?

708
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:31.176
Yeah.

709
00:47:32.277 --> 00:47:33.145
We talked.

710
00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:36.048
Y'all talk?

711
00:47:37.483 --> 00:47:39.552
Yeah. I mean.
that's what brothers

712
00:47:39.586 --> 00:47:40.587
and sisters do. Pop.

713
00:47:43.021 --> 00:47:45.023
I told her she should wait.

714
00:47:45.057 --> 00:47:47.359
but she just like you
and mom. hard headed.

715
00:47:54.066 --> 00:47:56.268
I can't move this
thing by myself.

716
00:47:59.739 --> 00:48:00.939
Yeah.

717
00:48:17.489 --> 00:48:18.457
What is this?

718
00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:20.492
Oh. it's a CB.

719
00:48:20.527 --> 00:48:22.161
Stands for citizen's band radio.

720
00:48:22.194 --> 00:48:23.128
you know. like the
truck drivers use.

721
00:48:23.162 --> 00:48:24.564
Oh. okay.

722
00:48:26.633 --> 00:48:28.333
I think I got it.

723
00:48:28.367 --> 00:48:32.337
Ah. yeah. still works.

724
00:48:32.371 --> 00:48:35.374
So how far can you
reach out to people on it?

725
00:48:35.407 --> 00:48:36.275
Not that far.

726
00:48:37.342 --> 00:48:38.611
It's got 40 channels. though.

727
00:48:41.113 --> 00:48:43.315
Hello. hello. hello.

728
00:48:43.348 --> 00:48:45.250
Is anybody out there?

729
00:48:45.284 --> 00:48:46.653
Anybody hear me?

730
00:48:46.686 --> 00:48:48.487
Wait. that is not
how the truckers do it.

731
00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:49.988
Let me show you.

732
00:48:51.223 --> 00:48:52.625
Breaker. breaker 1-9er.

733
00:48:52.659 --> 00:48:56.061
This is Little Mama
speaking. do you copy?

734
00:48:58.464 --> 00:49:00.065
Is anybody out there?

735
00:49:04.203 --> 00:49:05.370
Shit. Pop.

736
00:49:05.404 --> 00:49:06.639
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

737
00:49:06.673 --> 00:49:08.541
Okay. you guys stay together.

738
00:49:08.575 --> 00:49:10.008
Junior. don't you leave them.

739
00:49:10.042 --> 00:49:11.243
Oh. my God. Evan.

740
00:49:11.276 --> 00:49:13.345
I got it. go. I got it.

741
00:52:36.015 --> 00:52:36.883
Come on!

742
00:52:37.817 --> 00:52:39.351
What do you want?

743
00:52:59.438 --> 00:53:00.305
Evan!

744
00:53:12.451 --> 00:53:13.820
Get the gun.

745
00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:25.665
Who are you?

746
00:53:28.835 --> 00:53:29.702
Talk.

747
00:53:29.736 --> 00:53:30.803
I can't talk.

748
00:53:31.871 --> 00:53:33.606
The grave has fallen.

749
00:53:35.307 --> 00:53:36.576
When the moon has darkened.

750
00:53:37.643 --> 00:53:39.377
A great panic from the Lord

751
00:53:39.411 --> 00:53:40.880
shall come down on them.

752
00:53:44.851 --> 00:53:46.719
There'll be no escape.

753
00:54:01.701 --> 00:54:02.869
What did he say?

754
00:54:04.904 --> 00:54:06.038
He said he was free.

755
00:54:24.389 --> 00:54:26.391
Get some towels. Junior.

756
00:54:28.528 --> 00:54:29.796
Get some towels.

757
00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:41.406
Daddy?

758
00:54:42.675 --> 00:54:44.043
Dad. what's wrong?

759
00:54:45.645 --> 00:54:46.511
Junior.

760
00:54:53.619 --> 00:54:54.486
Here.

761
00:55:12.071 --> 00:55:15.373
Junior. really. you
brought the white ones.

762
00:55:15.407 --> 00:55:16.742
Man. and I thought you told me

763
00:55:16.776 --> 00:55:18.343
you barricaded the back door.

764
00:55:19.178 --> 00:55:20.780
I mean. I did.

765
00:55:20.813 --> 00:55:22.582
Then why was it
left wide open?

766
00:55:22.615 --> 00:55:25.417
Man. I take back everything
good I said about you.

767
00:55:25.450 --> 00:55:26.786
Man. I don't know you
didn't fuckin' mean it anyway.

768
00:55:26.819 --> 00:55:28.654
When you gonna
grow up and be a man?

769
00:55:28.688 --> 00:55:29.689
You move.

770
00:55:29.722 --> 00:55:30.890
Mom!

771
00:55:30.923 --> 00:55:33.693
Dad.
stop it. please.

772
00:55:33.726 --> 00:55:34.827
Calm down.

773
00:55:34.861 --> 00:55:35.728
Junior!

774
00:55:37.663 --> 00:55:38.931
Junior!

775
00:55:38.965 --> 00:55:40.700
Calm down. please.

776
00:56:33.518 --> 00:56:34.854
Was it all bad?

777
00:56:37.223 --> 00:56:40.026
Do you
want the truth?

778
00:56:44.597 --> 00:56:45.463
Or the lie?

779
00:56:46.232 --> 00:56:47.099
The lie.

780
00:56:54.807 --> 00:56:56.242
We're living a lie.

781
00:56:56.275 --> 00:56:58.144
How about the
truth for a change.

782
00:56:58.177 --> 00:56:59.612
Okay. the truth.

783
00:57:03.149 --> 00:57:05.618
It's been hell every minute.

784
00:57:05.651 --> 00:57:07.820
How the hell can you say that?

785
00:57:07.853 --> 00:57:09.221
Man. I gave you everything.

786
00:57:09.255 --> 00:57:11.757
Everything you wanted to give.

787
00:57:11.791 --> 00:57:13.025
None of it was about me.

788
00:57:13.059 --> 00:57:14.160
You worked. you sweated.

789
00:57:14.193 --> 00:57:17.263
but it was all for you. all you.

790
00:57:17.296 --> 00:57:21.100
Okay. well. well now
I want that to change.

791
00:57:22.702 --> 00:57:23.836
The start of the
great tribulation

792
00:57:23.869 --> 00:57:26.205
and now you wanna change.

793
00:57:26.238 --> 00:57:28.841
It's never too late to change.

794
00:57:28.874 --> 00:57:30.176
Who fed you that lie?

795
00:57:31.744 --> 00:57:33.779
But the strange
thing about a lie?

796
00:57:33.813 --> 00:57:36.182
It always finds a way of
turning into the truth.

797
00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:41.654
One way or another. it's over.

798
00:57:43.856 --> 00:57:44.690
What?

799
00:58:06.178 --> 00:58:07.512
Was that a lie?

800
00:58:09.682 --> 00:58:10.549
No.

801
00:58:12.051 --> 00:58:14.687
But it was a long. long time ago

802
00:58:17.857 --> 00:58:19.759
when you and I were
different people.

803
00:58:22.762 --> 00:58:23.829
I love you. Carmen.

804
00:58:25.898 --> 00:58:28.234
And you and my kids.

805
00:58:29.735 --> 00:58:32.038
They're adults
now. except for Evan.

806
00:58:32.071 --> 00:58:33.172
My family.

807
00:58:38.077 --> 00:58:40.112
You mean more than anything

808
00:58:40.146 --> 00:58:42.114
in the world to me right now.

809
00:58:42.148 --> 00:58:45.651
Especially now. especially
now. especially now.

810
00:58:45.684 --> 00:58:47.086
You have to lose everything

811
00:58:47.119 --> 00:58:48.320
in order to feel alive?

812
00:58:48.354 --> 00:58:50.956
You're sicker than I thought.

813
00:58:50.990 --> 00:58:53.692
You haven't cared about
your family for 25 years.

814
00:58:53.726 --> 00:58:54.960
That's not true.

815
00:58:54.994 --> 00:58:56.796
Evan is the only one

816
00:58:56.829 --> 00:58:57.930
that you ever showed.

817
00:59:01.267 --> 00:59:02.201
What about Evan?

818
00:59:07.139 --> 00:59:08.707
Evan was the only one

819
00:59:08.741 --> 00:59:11.077
you ever showed that
you cared about.

820
00:59:12.211 --> 00:59:14.046
The rest of us you just starved

821
00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:16.282
until we withered away.

822
00:59:26.759 --> 00:59:28.794
Breaker. breaker
this is Lone Wolf.

823
00:59:29.728 --> 00:59:30.729
You copy Little Mama?

824
00:59:33.299 --> 00:59:34.867
Breaker. breaker Lone Wolf.

825
00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:36.202
this is Little
Mama. do you copy?

826
00:59:38.104 --> 00:59:39.305
Let me see. let me see.

827
00:59:39.338 --> 00:59:40.339
What's your 20?

828
00:59:41.807 --> 00:59:43.209
What are those?

829
00:59:43.242 --> 00:59:44.210
It's CB code.

830
00:59:46.045 --> 00:59:47.880
I'm trapped on
the Vincent Thomas bridge

831
00:59:47.913 --> 00:59:51.784
in a greasy side-up in this
goddamn chicken choker.

832
00:59:51.817 --> 00:59:54.854
What's he saying?

833
00:59:55.921 --> 00:59:57.389
He flipped over on his side

834
00:59:57.423 --> 01:00:01.060
and he was hauling chickens.

835
01:00:02.428 --> 01:00:04.230
I got hit by
a cowboy's Cadillac

836
01:00:04.263 --> 01:00:06.365
after he ran over
an organ donor.

837
01:00:08.434 --> 01:00:10.769
I got hit by a pickup truck

838
01:00:10.803 --> 01:00:13.906
that ran over a motorcyclist.

839
01:00:13.939 --> 01:00:15.141
Wait. are you for real?

840
01:00:16.275 --> 01:00:17.676
Copy that. Lone Wolf.

841
01:00:17.710 --> 01:00:18.711
Are you okay?

842
01:00:20.212 --> 01:00:21.814
Knee's all busted up.

843
01:00:23.115 --> 01:00:25.151
I'm not going
anyway anytime soon.

844
01:00:26.919 --> 01:00:28.254
Sure could use
some cactus juice.

845
01:00:28.287 --> 01:00:31.223
Cactus juice.
cactus juice. liquor.

846
01:00:32.491 --> 01:00:34.293
How you
holding up. Little Mama?

847
01:00:36.195 --> 01:00:40.933
We're holding. just me
and my family. scared.

848
01:00:40.966 --> 01:00:43.702
Ask him does he know
anything about an attack.

849
01:00:45.104 --> 01:00:46.906
Please. Lone Wolf. I
mean is there anything

850
01:00:46.939 --> 01:00:48.974
you can tell us about
what's going on. something?

851
01:00:50.342 --> 01:00:52.178
All I know
is I haven't slept

852
01:00:52.211 --> 01:00:55.481
or eaten in two days trying
to stay in front of it.

853
01:00:55.514 --> 01:00:58.250
Two days. I drove like the wind.

854
01:00:58.284 --> 01:00:59.885
In front of what. Lone Wolf?

855
01:01:01.086 --> 01:01:01.954
The fever.

856
01:01:03.322 --> 01:01:05.324
That's what I used to
call it back in Nam.

857
01:01:07.293 --> 01:01:12.131
People caught up.
swept into a frenzy

858
01:01:12.164 --> 01:01:14.700
of killed or be killed.

859
01:01:16.135 --> 01:01:18.137
God used it many
times in the past

860
01:01:18.170 --> 01:01:20.239
to destroy his enemies.

861
01:01:20.272 --> 01:01:23.876
Confusing them until
they killed themselves.

862
01:01:26.011 --> 01:01:29.481
Somewhere out there.
a spark was lit

863
01:01:29.515 --> 01:01:32.918
and it started a fire
in the hearts of man.

864
01:01:32.952 --> 01:01:35.754
a fever not of the
body. but the mind.

865
01:01:37.122 --> 01:01:40.159
For two days I stayed in
front of death's door.

866
01:01:40.192 --> 01:01:44.230
but now it's here knocking.
just like I dreamed.

867
01:01:45.565 --> 01:01:47.233
Are you in trouble. Lone Wolf.

868
01:01:48.801 --> 01:01:50.069
Aren't we
all Little Mama.

869
01:01:51.370 --> 01:01:52.504
I'm Crystal.

870
01:01:53.939 --> 01:01:55.040
I'm Rick.

871
01:01:55.074 --> 01:01:56.141
Nice meeting you. little lady.

872
01:01:57.309 --> 01:01:58.844
The button pushers are here.

873
01:02:03.816 --> 01:02:04.950
Troublemakers.

874
01:02:06.553 --> 01:02:09.121
You get out of there
now. Rick. do you hear me?

875
01:02:09.154 --> 01:02:11.023
Get out now Lone Wolf.

876
01:02:12.091 --> 01:02:13.892
Adios. Little Mama.

877
01:02:15.562 --> 01:02:17.229
Rick!

878
01:02:18.531 --> 01:02:19.398
Rick!

879
01:02:22.368 --> 01:02:24.837
He's only 15
minutes away from us.

880
01:03:11.116 --> 01:03:14.219
Oh. Evan. oh. my God.

881
01:03:15.387 --> 01:03:16.822
Your fever's broken.

882
01:03:19.626 --> 01:03:21.493
Who you waving to. sweetie.

883
01:03:21.528 --> 01:03:23.195
Mom. who is that?

884
01:03:25.197 --> 01:03:26.265
Oh. my God.

885
01:03:28.535 --> 01:03:30.570
Oh. come on sweetie.

886
01:03:34.106 --> 01:03:35.240
Who the hell is that?

887
01:03:38.043 --> 01:03:38.911
Carmen?

888
01:03:47.019 --> 01:03:49.154
Detective Jonathan
Little. LAPD.

889
01:03:49.188 --> 01:03:50.989
may I please come in.

890
01:03:53.125 --> 01:03:54.326
Thank you. sir.

891
01:03:57.996 --> 01:04:00.432
So why
are you here Detective

892
01:04:00.466 --> 01:04:02.301
and what's going on out there?

893
01:04:04.036 --> 01:04:06.372
I wish I had more
information for you.

894
01:04:08.474 --> 01:04:10.509
But I'll tell you what I know.

895
01:04:12.111 --> 01:04:13.212
Crystal. sweetie.
could you take Evan

896
01:04:13.245 --> 01:04:14.980
to the other room. thanks.

897
01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:22.555
About six hours ago

898
01:04:22.589 --> 01:04:24.657
before we lost control
of the airwaves.

899
01:04:24.691 --> 01:04:26.191
a code three was sent out.

900
01:04:28.026 --> 01:04:30.530
It was from a secure line
from Homeland Security.

901
01:04:32.197 --> 01:04:35.033
It stated that 15 cities
from around the world

902
01:04:36.636 --> 01:04:40.305
for the past 30 days have
been systematically poisoned.

903
01:04:42.609 --> 01:04:43.942
How?

904
01:04:43.976 --> 01:04:45.210
The water. the air we breathe.

905
01:04:45.244 --> 01:04:46.512
the food that we eat.

906
01:04:47.614 --> 01:04:49.214
Marcos was right.

907
01:04:49.248 --> 01:04:51.885
L.A. was on top of
that list. I'm sorry.

908
01:04:54.486 --> 01:04:56.121
Somehow that cable got hacked

909
01:04:56.155 --> 01:04:57.322
and leaked onto the internet

910
01:04:57.356 --> 01:05:00.359
and it was run on the banks.

911
01:05:01.661 --> 01:05:04.163
Rumors became fact.

912
01:05:04.196 --> 01:05:05.330
This is the end.

913
01:05:06.432 --> 01:05:08.033
And we lost control.

914
01:05:11.571 --> 01:05:13.071
So why are you here?

915
01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:18.444
Junior. Crystal. can I speak

916
01:05:18.477 --> 01:05:21.313
with your parents in private.

917
01:05:23.081 --> 01:05:25.250
How do you know my
kids' names. Detective?

918
01:05:35.294 --> 01:05:36.763
It's a DNA test.

919
01:05:36.796 --> 01:05:38.464
It was taken six years ago.

920
01:05:44.771 --> 01:05:47.506
I know it's hard.

921
01:05:49.241 --> 01:05:50.476
but I have to see my son.

922
01:05:52.745 --> 01:05:54.614
I never wanted this.

923
01:05:54.647 --> 01:05:56.315
She's telling you the
truth when she says that.

924
01:05:57.684 --> 01:06:00.519
I wanted her to leave
your ass six years ago.

925
01:06:01.453 --> 01:06:03.021
We love each other.

926
01:06:03.055 --> 01:06:05.157
But she wanted to
stick it out for you.

927
01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:07.025
she said for the
sake of the family.

928
01:06:09.361 --> 01:06:11.096
Took a whole lot of
convincing for me

929
01:06:11.129 --> 01:06:13.398
not to come here before now.

930
01:06:13.432 --> 01:06:16.235
But when you got a piece
of you that's out there.

931
01:06:16.268 --> 01:06:17.670
you gonna see it through.

932
01:06:18.738 --> 01:06:20.272
I thought maybe I wasn't making

933
01:06:20.305 --> 01:06:22.441
the right decision
coming here before now.

934
01:06:24.343 --> 01:06:28.347
but living a whole life of
lies makes you wanna do right

935
01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:30.750
and there wasn't a day
in the past six years

936
01:06:30.783 --> 01:06:33.352
I didn't wake up regretting
making that decision.

937
01:06:40.425 --> 01:06:42.294
Sure is funny
how lies turn into

938
01:06:42.327 --> 01:06:45.097
the truth. huh. Carmen?

939
01:06:49.201 --> 01:06:52.237
It's hurts being
lied to. doesn't it?

940
01:06:57.644 --> 01:07:00.713
You let me believe
that he was mine

941
01:07:01.848 --> 01:07:05.552
for six fuckin' years?

942
01:07:05.585 --> 01:07:07.452
For six fuckin' years.

943
01:07:09.889 --> 01:07:11.189
Who was it for. Carmen?

944
01:07:11.223 --> 01:07:12.324
You deserve to know the truth.

945
01:07:12.357 --> 01:07:14.226
Get your fuckin' hands off me.

946
01:07:14.259 --> 01:07:16.729
Was it for you or was it for me?

947
01:07:16.763 --> 01:07:18.765
Who was it for?

948
01:07:18.798 --> 01:07:20.465
Get away from me.

949
01:07:21.901 --> 01:07:23.302
I wanna see my son.

950
01:07:24.604 --> 01:07:26.271
You come in my
fuckin' house tell me

951
01:07:26.305 --> 01:07:29.474
we all gonna die so
you can take my son.

952
01:07:29.508 --> 01:07:31.711
He ain't your son. Clarence.

953
01:07:33.211 --> 01:07:35.180
Six years I've driven
past this house

954
01:07:35.213 --> 01:07:36.883
hoping to get a
glimpse of my son.

955
01:07:36.916 --> 01:07:40.218
I'm gonna be the one to teach
him how to play basketball.

956
01:07:40.252 --> 01:07:41.854
not your ass.

957
01:07:43.388 --> 01:07:46.425
If this is all the time
I have with my son.

958
01:07:46.458 --> 01:07:50.830
I'm gonna spend it with
him right the fuck now.

959
01:07:53.231 --> 01:07:54.734
You think 'cause
you lay a little seed.

960
01:07:54.767 --> 01:07:56.501
that make you a father.

961
01:08:00.573 --> 01:08:02.307
Get the fuck outta my way.

962
01:08:05.945 --> 01:08:08.881
Don't deny Evan
what you never had.

963
01:08:08.915 --> 01:08:11.149
You
shut the fuck up.

964
01:08:11.183 --> 01:08:15.120
Clarence. let the
boy see his father.

965
01:08:26.431 --> 01:08:27.432
Thank you.

966
01:08:48.453 --> 01:08:49.388
Where you going?

967
01:08:51.323 --> 01:08:54.560
I have to be there
when he tells him.

968
01:09:10.877 --> 01:09:12.745
Dad. listen.

969
01:09:14.279 --> 01:09:15.915
We all knew. but we love you.

970
01:09:15.948 --> 01:09:17.282
we don't wanna hurt you.

971
01:09:18.951 --> 01:09:20.553
We just didn't wanna hurt you.

972
01:09:27.292 --> 01:09:27.960
Okay.

973
01:09:33.365 --> 01:09:34.299
You. too?

974
01:09:49.514 --> 01:09:50.382
Okay.

975
01:09:51.918 --> 01:09:53.251
It'll be okay.

976
01:09:54.654 --> 01:09:55.922
Sit down. Dad.

977
01:10:01.493 --> 01:10:03.361
Daddy. it's okay.

978
01:10:05.297 --> 01:10:06.933
Dad. please. stop.

979
01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:12.270
It's okay. Dad.

980
01:10:24.349 --> 01:10:27.553
Daddy. calm down please.
you're scaring me.

981
01:10:32.725 --> 01:10:34.727
Okay. okay.

982
01:10:35.895 --> 01:10:37.697
It's gonna be okay.

983
01:10:40.398 --> 01:10:41.333
I'm okay.

984
01:10:43.335 --> 01:10:44.003
Okay.

985
01:11:28.681 --> 01:11:29.549
Daddy.

986
01:11:30.850 --> 01:11:31.717
Daddy. no.

987
01:11:32.819 --> 01:11:33.653
Dad!

988
01:11:33.686 --> 01:11:34.554
Mom!

989
01:11:37.657 --> 01:11:40.425
You get your hands
off my wife and my kid.

990
01:11:40.458 --> 01:11:41.561
Clarence.

991
01:11:41.594 --> 01:11:42.628
Put the fuckin' gun down.

992
01:11:44.063 --> 01:11:45.598
This is my house.

993
01:11:46.666 --> 01:11:48.901
This is my wife and it's my son.

994
01:11:48.935 --> 01:11:51.403
He ain't your son.

995
01:11:51.436 --> 01:11:52.538
Please. please. don't do this.

996
01:11:52.572 --> 01:11:53.539
don't let this happen this way.

997
01:11:53.573 --> 01:11:54.941
Clarence. I'm sorry.

998
01:11:54.974 --> 01:11:57.577
Please. don't do this.

01:11:57.610 --> 01:11:59.377
Daddy.
please stop it.

1000
01:11:59.411 --> 01:12:00.079
Know what?

1001
01:12:01.647 --> 01:12:06.085
Hopes and dreams are
built on three words.

1002
01:12:07.119 --> 01:12:07.987
I love you.

1003
01:12:10.522 --> 01:12:11.657
You betrayed me.

1004
01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:14.961
All of y'all

1005
01:12:18.064 --> 01:12:18.931
betrayed me.

1006
01:12:22.568 --> 01:12:25.037
Put the fuckin' gun down now.

1007
01:12:25.071 --> 01:12:26.806
Dad. please. stop.

1008
01:12:29.775 --> 01:12:31.143
Come here.

1009
01:12:31.177 --> 01:12:34.479
Come here little man. come on.

1010
01:12:34.512 --> 01:12:35.380
Come on.

1011
01:12:36.514 --> 01:12:37.382
Come on.

1012
01:12:39.018 --> 01:12:40.119
Come to your dad.

Come of your daddy. come.

Come to your dad.

1015
01:13:26.866 --> 01:13:28.200
Come to your dad.

1016
01:13:29.802 --> 01:13:30.670
No.

1017
01:13:33.839 --> 01:13:34.707
No.

1018
01:13:41.013 --> 01:13:43.916
No.

1019
01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:48.955
No. this is just how I dreamed.

1020
01:13:49.889 --> 01:13:51.090
This is not happening.

1021
01:13:51.123 --> 01:13:53.225
- No!
- No!

1022
01:13:55.594 --> 01:13:56.461
Mom!

1023
01:14:01.701 --> 01:14:02.702
Babe!

1024
01:14:02.735 --> 01:14:03.602
Evan!

1025
01:14:15.715 --> 01:14:16.549
Motherfucker!

1026
01:16:05.124 --> 01:16:07.193
You can't have my family.

1027
01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:35.888
I'm sorry. baby.

1028
01:18:16.522 --> 01:18:17.389
No.

01:18:20.292 --> 01:18:21.894
I'm sorry. Junior!

1030
01:19:23.055 --> 01:19:23.922
Evan.

1031
01:19:25.924 --> 01:19:27.293
No matter what people say.

1032
01:19:29.194 --> 01:19:30.496
no matter what you hear.

1033
01:19:32.998 --> 01:19:34.567
I will always be your father.

1034
01:19:38.037 --> 01:19:39.438
I love you. Dad.

1035
01:19:41.373 --> 01:19:42.508
I know. man.

1036
01:19:46.312 --> 01:19:49.281
I want you to remember
something. okay?

1037
01:19:54.253 --> 01:19:58.223

There's no poison attack.

it's all a big lie.

1064
01:24:25.592 --> 01:24:26.626
Mr. McGee.

1065
01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:29.696

What'd you fucking do!

1073
01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:08.701
Don't go out there.

01:25:08.735 --> 01:25:10.335
we're still under martial law.

1075
01:25:10.369 --> 01:25:13.505

Hands up. hands up.

1095
01:28:06.679 --> 01:28:08.014
One lucky winner

will win $1 billion
and counting.

1097
01:28:10.817 --> 01:28:12.819
That's the count.

1098

It's Lotto fever
