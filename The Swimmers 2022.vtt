3
00:03:04.625 --> 00:03:06.291
Why aren't you surprised?

4
00:03:06.375 --> 00:03:08.833
Seems like you knew. little one.

5
00:03:08.916 --> 00:03:10.791
No. of course not. How could I know?

6
00:03:11.875 --> 00:03:13.750
Happy birthday. darling.

7
00:03:13.833 --> 00:03:14.833
Thanks. Mama.

8
00:03:15.916 --> 00:03:18.458
Now go to your room
and change your clothes.

9
00:03:18.541 --> 00:03:21.625
OK. everyone. let's eat.
Help yourselves.

10
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.166
Sara. what are you doing?
Come dance with us.

11
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.125
-In a minute.
-What are you watching?

12
00:03:57.458 --> 00:03:59.625
How many times have I told you
not to watch these things?

13
00:03:59.708 --> 00:04:00.916
This is reality. Mama.

14
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.333
What happened in Tunisia.
Egypt and Libya is happening here.

15
00:04:03.416 --> 00:04:05.916
And I've told you nothing like that
can happen in Syria.

16
00:04:07.583 --> 00:04:09.083
Yalla. darling.

17
00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:12.791
-The party's boring. I don't want to.
-Yalla. for your sister's sake.

18
00:04:19.208 --> 00:04:20.833
Uncle. come on.

19
00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:31.000
I thank God day and night for blessing me
with three strong daughters.

20
00:04:31.083 --> 00:04:33.416
stronger than a thousand sons.

21
00:04:34.375 --> 00:04:39.791
But don't forget how lucky these girls are
that I'm their dad

22
00:04:40.541 --> 00:04:41.583
and their coach.

23
00:04:41.666 --> 00:04:43.291
Here he goes.

24
00:04:44.666 --> 00:04:48.291
Two weeks ago. at the qualifying meet
for the national championships.

25
00:04:48.375 --> 00:04:53.583
Yusra improved her personal best
in the 100m butterfly.

26
00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:56.916
Congrats. Yusra.

27
00:04:58.166 --> 00:04:59.750
But Sara won her heat too.

28
00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:03.541
Yeah. Sara is headstrong
and a leader like me.

29
00:05:03.625 --> 00:05:09.166
But Yusra has discipline.
strength and perseverance.

30
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.708
-She is my powerhouse.
-What about me?

31
00:05:11.791 --> 00:05:15.416
And you. Shahed. Daddy's darling.

32
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.875
are my little warrior.

33
00:05:18.875 --> 00:05:22.583
Dear guests.
I will be the first father in history

34
00:05:22.666 --> 00:05:26.000
to have three daughters
swimming in the Olympics.

35
00:05:43.541 --> 00:05:45.416
Nizar.

36
00:05:52.375 --> 00:05:53.875
-How you doing?
-Good.

37
00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.125
Play a song for us.

38
00:05:55.208 --> 00:05:57.083
-What?
-Play a song for us.

39
00:05:57.166 --> 00:05:59.625
-What's it worth?
-I'll buy you a shot.

40
00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.166
For you guys.

41
00:07:17.208 --> 00:07:19.583
Go. Sara. go. Kick his ass.

42
00:07:19.666 --> 00:07:21.500
Show me then.

43
00:07:21.583 --> 00:07:23.916
No. you can't do that.

44
00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.708
No. I swear you can't do that.

45
00:07:31.916 --> 00:07:32.750
Why?

46
00:07:55.583 --> 00:07:56.458
What?

47
00:07:59.875 --> 00:08:01.083
Razan Haddad is dead.

48
00:08:03.208 --> 00:08:04.333
In a bombing.

49
00:08:07.833 --> 00:08:08.916
My God…

50
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.041
I just saw her.

51
00:08:44.125 --> 00:08:47.083
Sara. be careful. Get back in.

52
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.583
You're so annoying.

53
00:08:52.666 --> 00:08:54.166
Hala. you can help me. you know.

54
00:08:58.583 --> 00:09:03.500
Razan Haddad. We'll never forget you.

55
00:09:14.791 --> 00:09:16.000
Hey. beautiful.

56
00:09:16.791 --> 00:09:17.958
What's up. ladies?

57
00:09:18.041 --> 00:09:21.458
Come have a drink with us.
Unless you don't like the look of me?

58
00:09:21.541 --> 00:09:23.541
Aren't we good enough for you?

59
00:09:30.666 --> 00:09:31.958
Where have you been?

60
00:09:33.375 --> 00:09:35.333
Aren't you out a little late tonight?

61
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:52.875
Sara. shush. be careful.

62
00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.083
Give me the keys.

63
00:09:55.166 --> 00:09:56.791
You'll wake Baba and Mama.

64
00:10:10.708 --> 00:10:11.958
How are you. darling?

65
00:10:18.458 --> 00:10:19.958
Don't be frightened.

66
00:10:22.666 --> 00:10:23.875
Good night. my love.

67
00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.708
Do you have any idea what time it is?

68
00:10:30.791 --> 00:10:33.916
Do you know what your dad
would do if he knew?

69
00:10:40.875 --> 00:10:43.208
Did you hear about Razan Haddad?

70
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.791
I heard.

71
00:10:50.791 --> 00:10:54.708
God bless her soul
and give her mother strength.

72
00:11:05.791 --> 00:11:09.708
Yalla. darling. Time to sleep.
You have training in the morning.

73
00:11:25.625 --> 00:11:26.875
What was my time?

74
00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.125
You're tired.

75
00:11:28.208 --> 00:11:29.750
What was my time. Baba?

76
00:11:30.791 --> 00:11:33.083
Coach. I'll see you at home.

77
00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:51.291
You see?
It's all arm propulsion. not the kick.

78
00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:58.000
You know he went to Sydney when he was 15?

79
00:12:01.416 --> 00:12:04.666
The youngest American swimmer
to compete at the Olympics.

80
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.625
You aren't a true athlete
unless your dream is the Olympics.

81
00:12:15.458 --> 00:12:18.958
You're not going to represent us
at the Nationals this time.

82
00:12:19.041 --> 00:12:22.208
Yusra and Arwa got better times than you.

83
00:12:58.666 --> 00:12:59.791
You're disgusting.

84
00:13:08.375 --> 00:13:09.500
IDs.

85
00:13:16.625 --> 00:13:17.791
Omar?

86
00:13:17.875 --> 00:13:20.833
From Duma? What are you doing here?

87
00:13:24.291 --> 00:13:25.625
Why are you laughing?

88
00:13:25.708 --> 00:13:28.625
Since when has laughing become illegal?

89
00:13:28.708 --> 00:13:29.625
Give me your ID.

90
00:13:29.708 --> 00:13:31.458
Please. she didn't mean disrespect.

91
00:13:31.541 --> 00:13:32.958
Shut up. you.

92
00:13:34.791 --> 00:13:36.375
I'm not disrespecting.

93
00:13:36.458 --> 00:13:38.625
Don't talk too much. Understand?

94
00:13:40.125 --> 00:13:41.583
Raise your arms.

95
00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:52.750
You'd do this to your sisters?

96
00:13:52.833 --> 00:13:54.291
You're not my sister.

97
00:14:01.125 --> 00:14:02.333
Is this your sister?

98
00:14:03.125 --> 00:14:04.625
Stand up.

99
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.041
Raise your arms.

100
00:14:30.916 --> 00:14:32.041
Sniper.

101
00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:35.791
Eyes up.

102
00:14:37.375 --> 00:14:38.875
Look up.

103
00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.250
Go. There are people on the bus.

104
00:14:56.250 --> 00:15:00.083
YOUR PLANES CAN'T BOMB OUR DREAMS

105
00:15:04.083 --> 00:15:07.416
How can I let my girls
travel across Europe on their own?

106
00:15:08.791 --> 00:15:11.666
What happened to
the strong daughters you raised?

107
00:15:14.291 --> 00:15:17.791
You know Razan Haddad is
my third friend to die this month?

108
00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.208
You know how many times
we've come close to death?

109
00:15:21.833 --> 00:15:25.750
We need to get Yusra to Germany
as soon as possible before she turns 18.

110
00:15:27.416 --> 00:15:30.208
The problem is it's so dangerous. my love.

111
00:15:30.291 --> 00:15:32.166
I wish you could go on a plane.

112
00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:35.666
Because European countries
are just handing out visas to Syrians.

113
00:15:36.625 --> 00:15:41.250
Mama. it's very easy. We get to Germany
and apply for family reunion.

114
00:15:41.333 --> 00:15:43.708
and you can all come on a plane.
It's simple.

115
00:15:43.791 --> 00:15:45.750
So I let you two risk your lives.

116
00:15:45.833 --> 00:15:49.166
crawl through the most dangerous parts
of Europe. to get us plane tickets?

117
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:53.208
Everyone's doing it. Hala did it.
She told me it's really easy…

118
00:15:53.291 --> 00:15:54.958
My darling. come here.

119
00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.750
-It's out in the whole neighborhood.
-I'm scared of the dark.

120
00:15:59.833 --> 00:16:01.250
Don't be scared. little one.

121
00:16:01.916 --> 00:16:04.250
I hope the car battery will last.

122
00:16:09.333 --> 00:16:11.791
Yalla. see? Now eat up.

123
00:16:13.375 --> 00:16:15.458
I wish we could go back to Darayya.

124
00:16:17.791 --> 00:16:21.833
-Darayya is still too dangerous.
-The whole of Syria is too dangerous.

125
00:16:21.916 --> 00:16:25.125
But you and your sister walking
across Europe isn't dangerous at all?

126
00:16:25.208 --> 00:16:27.625
Yes. but once we arrive.
we'll all be safe.

127
00:16:27.708 --> 00:16:29.166
That's if you arrive.

128
00:16:30.083 --> 00:16:32.666
And if you arrive. what will you be?

129
00:16:33.333 --> 00:16:34.833
Refugees?

130
00:16:34.916 --> 00:16:36.791
And you'll ruin your swimming careers.

131
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.041
It's the best way.

132
00:16:39.125 --> 00:16:41.791
She always thinks she has the best way.

133
00:16:41.875 --> 00:16:43.083
You're not going.

134
00:16:44.041 --> 00:16:45.416
That's the end of it.

135
00:16:46.583 --> 00:16:50.000
If I was the one who was 17.
you'd let me go on my own.

136
00:17:05.458 --> 00:17:08.791
Baba. about Sara…

137
00:17:11.375 --> 00:17:12.916
Stop thinking about her.

138
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:13.958
Concentrate.

139
00:17:15.375 --> 00:17:18.333
In the water. you're on your own.
It's your fight.

140
00:17:18.416 --> 00:17:20.625
Your aim is to win.
It's not about being nice.

141
00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:23.625
You have a goal. and you must reach it.

142
00:17:23.708 --> 00:17:26.375
Focus on all the things
you have control over.

143
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000
The start.

144
00:17:28.875 --> 00:17:29.833
Streamline.

145
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.333
The kick off the wall. Your breathing.

146
00:20:16.541 --> 00:20:18.625
Two people died on the football field.

147
00:20:29.708 --> 00:20:30.625
Baba.

148
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:33.375
Nizar is going to Germany.

149
00:20:38.083 --> 00:20:40.250
He'll travel with me and Sara
and protect us.

150
00:20:40.333 --> 00:20:42.250
I wouldn't trust him
to cross the road with you.

151
00:20:42.333 --> 00:20:44.000
let alone take you all the way to Germany.

152
00:20:44.083 --> 00:20:45.750
But. Ezzat. Nizar is their cousin.

153
00:20:45.833 --> 00:20:49.541
-You know he would never leave them.
-Whose side are you on?

154
00:20:49.625 --> 00:20:50.916
I'm not taking sides.

155
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.333
This isn't about us.
It's about the girls' lives.

156
00:20:54.416 --> 00:20:56.416
They don't have a future here anymore.

157
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.916
They're not going to summer camp.
Aren't you a mother?

158
00:21:13.125 --> 00:21:17.791
Baba. you see what's happening.
The situation's gone from bad to worse.

159
00:21:17.875 --> 00:21:20.750
How am I gonna make it
to the Olympics if I can't swim?

160
00:21:21.375 --> 00:21:25.000
I promise. when I get to Europe.
I'll keep training.

161
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.083
All the swimmers are leaving.

162
00:21:29.166 --> 00:21:32.458
See? I want to go.
I want to keep training.

163
00:21:32.541 --> 00:21:35.958
-I'll have to go with you.
-And leave Mama and Shahed on their own?

164
00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.833
What will become of me
if something happens to her?

165
00:21:39.916 --> 00:21:42.875
Nothing will happen.
Me and Nizar will be with her.

166
00:21:42.958 --> 00:21:44.166
I promise.

167
00:21:52.833 --> 00:21:54.083
Thank you. Baba.

168
00:21:58.041 --> 00:21:59.916
I'm not going with you.

169
00:22:26.041 --> 00:22:27.041
Dunno.

170
00:23:09.625 --> 00:23:12.375
You fly to Istanbul on a tourist visa.

171
00:23:12.458 --> 00:23:16.291
If anyone asks anything. you're tourists
going to Turkey on holiday.

172
00:23:16.375 --> 00:23:19.000
Find a smuggler
to take you over the Bulgarian border.

173
00:23:19.875 --> 00:23:24.083
This route is more expensive
than the sea crossing. but much safer.

174
00:23:28.208 --> 00:23:32.500
-Ten thousand euro. Guard it.
-How did you get it?

175
00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:36.000
I borrowed it.

176
00:23:36.083 --> 00:23:39.916
Isn't it too much. Baba?
Keep some for yourselves.

177
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.083
I'll try to get more
in case you get stuck.

178
00:23:46.625 --> 00:23:50.833
But if you do get stuck.
you do the talking.

179
00:23:51.791 --> 00:23:54.625
Of course. Don't worry. Uncle.

180
00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:58.333
This is yours.

181
00:24:02.791 --> 00:24:06.291
Tell people you swam for your country.

182
00:24:06.791 --> 00:24:08.458
That has to matter.

183
00:24:09.458 --> 00:24:10.750
You too. Sara.

184
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:21.500
Can I borrow your Converse?

185
00:24:21.583 --> 00:24:24.625
No. they are too big for you.
and I'm taking them with me.

186
00:24:24.708 --> 00:24:27.416
Can I use your nail polish?

187
00:24:29.416 --> 00:24:30.666
No. you'll ruin it.

188
00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:33.750
Can I come with you?

189
00:24:39.166 --> 00:24:41.041
Who would take care of Lulu?

190
00:24:54.625 --> 00:24:56.458
Look what I made you.

191
00:24:58.791 --> 00:25:00.291
You made this?

192
00:25:01.625 --> 00:25:04.208
It's to help you get to Germany.

193
00:25:04.291 --> 00:25:06.291
Oh. my love.

194
00:25:07.708 --> 00:25:09.416
I'm going to take it with me.

195
00:25:10.916 --> 00:25:14.166
Let's put Lulu in her cage
before she poops on your bed.

196
00:25:25.625 --> 00:25:28.125
-Come help us.
-What are you doing?

197
00:25:29.291 --> 00:25:30.875
Lulu's flying.

198
00:25:46.708 --> 00:25:48.458
When you were born.

199
00:25:50.125 --> 00:25:52.833
I decided to give you
the things I didn't have.

200
00:25:56.250 --> 00:26:00.125
Freedom to choose
whatever you want in life.

201
00:26:00.208 --> 00:26:03.000
When I closed my eyes
and imagined your futures…

202
00:26:04.708 --> 00:26:05.708
Here he comes.

203
00:26:06.958 --> 00:26:10.583
…I didn't picture you in a wedding dress
like all the other mothers.

204
00:26:11.666 --> 00:26:13.166
Sorry I'm late.

205
00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:14.916
What happened to you?

206
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.250
I forgot my passport.

207
00:26:17.625 --> 00:26:20.458
All I hoped was for you
to graduate from the best universities…

208
00:26:20.541 --> 00:26:24.750
Don't worry. They are like my sisters.
I'll guard them with my life.

209
00:26:24.833 --> 00:26:25.916
Come here.

210
00:26:27.833 --> 00:26:30.166
Having wonderful careers
and living the best life.

211
00:26:31.375 --> 00:26:33.041
that was everything I wished for.

212
00:26:36.375 --> 00:26:38.458
And we'll have all these things. Mama.

213
00:26:38.541 --> 00:26:40.000
Hopefully.

214
00:26:52.916 --> 00:26:54.250
Oh. my love.

215
00:27:02.208 --> 00:27:05.583
-I'll keep her safe. Don't worry.
-Keep yourself safe too.

216
00:27:06.333 --> 00:27:09.000
As soon as you arrive. call us. OK?

217
00:27:12.791 --> 00:27:14.750
Do you know that I love you?

218
00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:15.666
I know.

219
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:17.083
Do you really know?

220
00:27:18.958 --> 00:27:21.791
Don't go. Please don't go.

221
00:27:21.875 --> 00:27:23.958
We'll meet in Germany soon.

222
00:27:24.041 --> 00:27:25.666
I swear. Really soon.

223
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:28.666
-Passports. Where are you going?
-Istanbul.

224
00:27:31.083 --> 00:27:32.916
Have a safe journey.

225
00:27:42.291 --> 00:27:43.625
May God protect you.

226
00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:05.583
Welcome aboard this flight to Istanbul.

227
00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:08.000
We would like to remind you

228
00:28:08.083 --> 00:28:11.000
that life jackets are
the property of the airline.

229
00:28:11.083 --> 00:28:15.166
Any attempt to take them
will be considered an act of theft

230
00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:16.875
and you will be prosecuted.

231
00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:39.875
Don't hurt my sister.

232
00:29:42.208 --> 00:29:44.250
-No. my bed.
-I'm gonna pass out here.

233
00:29:47.375 --> 00:29:48.791
Enough. What?

234
00:30:27.208 --> 00:30:29.000
We're looking for a smuggler.

235
00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.250
Do you know someone reliable?

236
00:30:43.041 --> 00:30:46.333
-We're still on the European side.
-Yeah. so where do we go?

237
00:30:46.416 --> 00:30:47.958
We've taken the wrong bridge.

238
00:31:21.916 --> 00:31:23.666
They have SIM cards.

239
00:31:40.916 --> 00:31:43.416
What? Why are they dressed like that?

240
00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:47.291
They can't sell the suits.
so they put life jackets on them.

241
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:45.083
One?

242
00:33:52.708 --> 00:33:54.166
They're my daughters.

243
00:34:06.708 --> 00:34:07.875
We go down here?

244
00:34:12.458 --> 00:34:14.666
-You OK?
-Yeah.

245
00:35:02.833 --> 00:35:05.500
-You're Syrian?
-Yeah. Syrian.

246
00:35:06.083 --> 00:35:08.416
-Hello. I'm Nizar Mardini.
-Hi.

247
00:35:09.125 --> 00:35:10.750
-What's your name?
-Ninar.

248
00:35:35.583 --> 00:35:36.541
Where are you from?

249
00:35:36.625 --> 00:35:40.375
I've come from Sudan with my wife. Onnab.
We're going to Sweden. hopefully.

250
00:35:40.875 --> 00:35:43.083
Hello. nice to meet you.

251
00:36:08.625 --> 00:36:12.166
Damascus

252
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.333
Damascus…

253
00:39:22.583 --> 00:39:25.708
Look at its condition.
It's impossible. Look how many people.

254
00:39:25.791 --> 00:39:26.958
We're not going.

255
00:39:28.916 --> 00:39:31.000
Sara. come.

256
00:39:31.083 --> 00:39:32.666
We've paid using everything we have.

257
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:33.583
No. no.

258
00:41:05.125 --> 00:41:08.416
Sara? What if
they don't know how to swim?

259
00:41:15.333 --> 00:41:16.791
Who knows how to swim?

260
00:41:28.208 --> 00:41:31.125
If your hand is up.
help those with their hands down.

261
00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:50.416
We're in this together.
We'll help each other.

262
00:41:58.750 --> 00:41:59.791
God is great.

263
00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:03.583
Put your faith in God. guys.

264
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.958
This boat is damaged.
I swear it's damaged.

265
00:42:32.458 --> 00:42:34.208
Oh God. we're gonna sink.

266
00:42:35.916 --> 00:42:37.250
It's leaking.

267
00:42:38.666 --> 00:42:40.541
It's from the waves. Don't worry.

268
00:42:40.625 --> 00:42:42.083
It's full of water. man.

269
00:42:42.166 --> 00:42:43.791
Guys. it won't sink.

270
00:42:46.333 --> 00:42:48.791
We can handle this. OK? Don't worry.

271
00:42:49.708 --> 00:42:50.541
Baba…

272
00:42:51.208 --> 00:42:52.708
Don't be scared. son.

273
00:43:42.375 --> 00:43:43.458
Let me pass.

274
00:43:47.208 --> 00:43:49.625
Watch out for the kids. The kids.

275
00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:52.500
Listen to me. Listen.

276
00:43:54.625 --> 00:43:58.416
I studied mechanical engineering.
I'll try to fix the engine.

277
00:44:07.958 --> 00:44:09.500
Stay calm.

278
00:44:20.708 --> 00:44:23.291
God is the greatest.

279
00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:47.708
We're too heavy.

280
00:46:41.875 --> 00:46:45.416
Guys. I've got network.
The coast guards. It's ringing.

281
00:47:29.083 --> 00:47:31.125
Abdo. Give me your knife.

282
00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:36.875
Sara. what are you doing?

283
00:47:38.166 --> 00:47:39.208
Help me with the rope.

284
00:47:43.208 --> 00:47:44.500
Sara. what are you doing?

285
00:48:10.208 --> 00:48:11.833
No. No. Yusra. You'll die.

286
00:48:11.916 --> 00:48:14.041
For God's sake. don't do this.

287
00:48:20.541 --> 00:48:22.833
No. Nizar. Don't let her get in.

288
00:48:22.916 --> 00:48:23.916
What can I do?

289
00:56:44.583 --> 00:56:45.583
There's a tap.

290
00:56:45.666 --> 00:56:47.375
Guys. there's water.

291
00:56:47.458 --> 00:56:50.125
Come. There's water.

292
00:56:51.208 --> 00:56:52.583
Bring the children.

293
00:57:04.166 --> 00:57:05.625
OK. let's drink.

294
00:57:30.750 --> 00:57:34.791
I've called you a million times.
Are you OK? Where are you?

295
00:57:34.875 --> 00:57:36.916
In Lesbos. We're in Europe. Mama.

296
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:43.208
Thank God.
I've been praying for you every day.

297
00:57:43.291 --> 00:57:46.833
Bless you. Auntie.
Update my mother and look after her.

298
00:57:46.916 --> 00:57:48.458
Mama's crying.

299
00:57:49.833 --> 00:57:53.166
Joey's out of American Idol.
and it's not fair.

300
00:57:53.250 --> 00:57:54.583
And I miss…

301
00:59:20.208 --> 00:59:22.000
I saw this seagull floating above us.

302
00:59:23.916 --> 00:59:25.916
It stayed with us for a long time.

303
00:59:28.416 --> 00:59:30.875
For some reason.
it felt like it was guiding us.

304
00:59:32.541 --> 00:59:35.541
All I was thinking was how
Mama and Baba had no idea where we were.

305
00:59:35.625 --> 00:59:37.250
And how we didn't answer the phone.

306
00:59:40.291 --> 00:59:43.375
And how stupid it would be
for swimmers to die in the sea.

307
00:59:48.625 --> 00:59:51.833
Do you know what Baba will do
if he knows I let you get in the water?

308
00:59:54.125 --> 00:59:55.708
He'll be proud.

309
01:09:22.416 --> 01:09:23.500
Maybe it's better?

310
01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.291
Yes. no problem.

311
01:10:54.291 --> 01:10:55.333
Hold on.

312
01:13:17.375 --> 01:13:18.916
Thank God you're safe.

313
01:13:20.916 --> 01:13:22.333
Where's Sara?

314
01:13:22.833 --> 01:13:24.333
She still hasn't arrived.

315
01:13:31.333 --> 01:13:33.458
Don't worry. She'll be here soon.

316
01:15:18.625 --> 01:15:19.708
Finally.

317
01:16:32.916 --> 01:16:34.208
Animal.

318
01:20:11.125 --> 01:20:12.000
What?

319
01:22:00.541 --> 01:22:02.625
Maybe we should go home.

320
01:22:03.458 --> 01:22:05.458
We're not going back now. Yusra.

321
01:22:05.541 --> 01:22:07.375
Don't you see how far we've come?

322
01:22:08.375 --> 01:22:10.125
I'm not giving up now.

323
01:22:10.958 --> 01:22:11.958
Look at me.

324
01:22:23.416 --> 01:22:26.458
I listened to you before.
Now you need to listen to me.

325
01:22:26.958 --> 01:22:28.125
Listen to you?

326
01:22:34.291 --> 01:22:35.541
If we went with the others.

327
01:22:35.625 --> 01:22:37.291
If we didn't come at all.

328
01:22:37.375 --> 01:22:38.916
So it's my fault?

329
01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.500
Is it mine?

330
01:22:43.041 --> 01:22:45.125
Why did you bring me here if you hate me?

331
01:22:46.583 --> 01:22:47.750
To save you.

332
01:22:48.333 --> 01:22:49.583
And save the family.

333
01:23:14.250 --> 01:23:16.416
Was that man trying to save me?

334
01:23:18.458 --> 01:23:20.375
I wouldn't have let him hurt you.

335
01:23:21.958 --> 01:23:23.875
I wouldn't let him do anything to you.

336
01:23:32.625 --> 01:23:35.291
I'm scared something bad
will happen again.

337
01:23:37.583 --> 01:23:39.250
I wouldn't be able to handle it.

338
01:24:19.666 --> 01:24:21.041
Which one though?

339
01:24:25.458 --> 01:24:26.833
God. there's a lot of people.

340
01:24:28.375 --> 01:24:30.750
No. that's number three.

341
01:24:32.750 --> 01:24:34.041
Go. yalla.

342
01:25:12.250 --> 01:25:13.916
Is this Germany. guys?

343
01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:18.958
We've arrived.

344
01:25:30.333 --> 01:25:33.625
Hello. Baba. We've arrived in Berlin.

345
01:25:33.708 --> 01:25:36.750
Uncle. we've arrived in Germany.

346
01:25:36.833 --> 01:25:38.833
We'll be seeing you soon.

347
01:25:38.916 --> 01:25:39.833
I love you all.

348
01:25:51.041 --> 01:25:52.625
The Germans are welcoming us.

349
01:25:52.708 --> 01:25:54.166
Enough. We made it.

350
01:25:54.916 --> 01:25:56.083
We made it.

351
01:27:22.875 --> 01:27:24.791
-What?
-I dunno.

352
01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Don't worry. The bomb landed
in the waste ground behind the house.

353
01:29:54.083 --> 01:29:58.041
Baba is checking on Uncle Ahmed.
Did you see about the asylum papers?

354
01:29:58.125 --> 01:30:02.375
Not yet. We're still waiting.
They have to give us an appointment first.

355
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:12.458
It's not Damascus.

356
01:30:15.125 --> 01:30:16.916
Our turn is coming.

357
01:32:23.041 --> 01:32:25.583
Yusra. he's training.

358
01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:22.291
FOREIGNERS OUT

359
01:41:28.583 --> 01:41:29.916
I'm not sleeping well.

360
01:44:46.625 --> 01:44:48.291
Don't you think you're being selfish?

361
01:44:48.375 --> 01:44:52.333
Selfish? I'm selfish?
Mama. Baba. and Shahed are in my heart.

362
01:44:53.458 --> 01:44:57.208
I keep thinking about them.
But you don't. you just carry on.

363
01:44:57.291 --> 01:45:00.625
You're reckless.
They're in danger now because of you.

364
01:45:00.708 --> 01:45:03.875
-You can talk.
-What?

365
01:45:03.958 --> 01:45:05.625
At least I have a goal.

366
01:45:05.708 --> 01:45:07.375
What are you doing here?

367
01:45:07.458 --> 01:45:09.875
You try to be cool
and waste your time partying.

368
01:45:10.750 --> 01:45:11.916
I don't know you anymore.

369
01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.375
You're not swimming.
You're not doing anything.

370
01:45:14.458 --> 01:45:16.583
You're never going to achieve anything.

371
01:49:26.833 --> 01:49:28.916
Tell me about your training.

372
01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:30.125
Of course. Baba.

373
01:49:32.958 --> 01:49:35.083
I want you to describe every detail.

374
01:49:36.541 --> 01:49:38.041
The feeling underwater.

375
01:49:39.208 --> 01:49:41.583
Every stroke. every move you make.

376
01:51:50.208 --> 01:51:52.833
An Olympian.
My own daughter an Olympian.

377
01:51:52.916 --> 01:51:54.250
I can't believe it.

378
01:51:54.333 --> 01:51:56.708
All that time at the poolside
wasn't for nothing.

379
01:51:56.791 --> 01:51:59.083
It's good. It's as it should be.

380
01:51:59.833 --> 01:52:02.291
And Sara? You didn't have the times?

381
01:52:03.583 --> 01:52:05.041
Even for this refugee team?

382
01:52:05.125 --> 01:52:06.583
No. Baba. I didn't.

383
01:52:07.583 --> 01:52:10.583
"Refugee team"?
You say it like it doesn't count.

384
01:53:08.083 --> 01:53:08.916
What?

385
01:55:00.625 --> 01:55:02.375
You've made us walk taller.

386
01:55:03.583 --> 01:55:05.208
Don't worry about winning.

387
01:55:06.958 --> 01:55:08.375
I am so proud of you.

388
01:55:21.333 --> 01:55:22.208
Peace.

389
01:59:36.708 --> 01:59:40.541
Good luck. my love.
I'm not worried because you're lucky.

390
01:59:40.625 --> 01:59:44.333
Luck has nothing to do with it.
Remember everything I've taught you.

391
01:59:44.416 --> 01:59:45.833
Yalla. Shahed.

392
01:59:45.916 --> 01:59:47.083
I hope you win.
