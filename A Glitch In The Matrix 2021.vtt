3
00:00:23.465 --> 00:00:25.534
<i>All right. So...</i>

4
00:00:27.236 --> 00:00:28.570
<i>Can you see me?</i>

5
00:00:28.871 --> 00:00:30.705
<i>Hey!
Yeah. there you are. Hey. Paul.</i>

6
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.709
<i>Hey! So I'm just now
starting the audio recorder.</i>

7
00:00:38.413 --> 00:00:40.315
<i>All right. so that's set up.</i>

8
00:00:41.083 --> 00:00:44.619
<i>And I'm starting
the video recorder.</i>

9
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:54.529
And I'm just making sure
that it's recording.

10
00:00:55.031 --> 00:00:59.202
Okay. So... Hello!

11
00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:00.937
One of the things that

12
00:01:01.237 --> 00:01:03.738
you wrote about was sort
of your first primitive idea

13
00:01:03.873 --> 00:01:06.575
- of simulation theory as a kid.
- Yeah.

14
00:01:06.776 --> 00:01:08.443
Yeah. can you describe
what that was like?

15
00:01:08.778 --> 00:01:11.013
Can I do one thing before that?

16
00:01:11.147 --> 00:01:12.315
Yeah.

17
00:01:12.647 --> 00:01:14.449
'Cause this is gonna set
the tenor for everything.

18
00:01:14.716 --> 00:01:15.885
<i>Please.</i>

19
00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:19.121
<i>Okay. I was in a class
when I was in college.</i>

20
00:01:19.255 --> 00:01:21.090
<i>I went to the University
of Missouri. Columbia.</i>

21
00:01:21.224 --> 00:01:22.624
<i>This was in the early '90s.</i>

22
00:01:23.192 --> 00:01:25.161
<i>And a teacher was
in front of the class</i>

23
00:01:25.294 --> 00:01:26.295
<i>and the teacher said.</i>

24
00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:29.364
<i>"Something interesting
about the brain</i>

25
00:01:29.932 --> 00:01:33.202
<i>is that we actually can map
what we think</i>

26
00:01:33.336 --> 00:01:34.837
<i>about the human nervous system</i>

27
00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:38.241
<i>by the highest level
of technology of the day."</i>

28
00:01:38.841 --> 00:01:41.576
<i>So for example.
when the aqueducts were big.</i>

29
00:01:41.878 --> 00:01:43.980
<i>people thought that
humors controlled the body.</i>

30
00:01:44.113 --> 00:01:47.216
<i>That different liquids
would come in and teach you...</i>

31
00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:49.651
<i>or make you feel
a different way.</i>

32
00:01:49.952 --> 00:01:52.121
<i>And then whenever
the telegraph came.</i>

33
00:01:52.288 --> 00:01:53.655
<i>then all of a sudden
we thought.</i>

34
00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.057
<i>"Well. these are nerve impulses</i>

35
00:01:55.191 --> 00:01:56.859
<i>that go down
sort of like wires."</i>

36
00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:00.830
<i>And then she said. "Now we know
that the brain is a computer."</i>

37
00:02:01.596 --> 00:02:03.165
<i>And I raised my hand. I said.</i>

38
00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.134
<i>"Because that's our highest
level of technology."</i>

39
00:02:05.268 --> 00:02:08.237
<i>And she said. "No. the brain
is a computer."</i>

40
00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:12.507
And I didn't do that well
in the class. but the thing is.

41
00:02:12.641 --> 00:02:14.911
so when we talk
about simulation theory...

42
00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:18.381
we. right now. are living
in a time where.

43
00:02:18.513 --> 00:02:21.183
you know. you have
the PS4. PSVR.

44
00:02:21.317 --> 00:02:22.550
<i>you know.</i>

45
00:02:22.684 --> 00:02:24.419
<i>I'm a Sony brand whore.
so I apologize</i>

46
00:02:24.552 --> 00:02:26.155
<i>for not throwing out
other things.</i>

47
00:02:26.956 --> 00:02:29.058
<i>But the basic. you know.</i>

48
00:02:29.225 --> 00:02:31.827
<i>virtual reality level
of simulation</i>

49
00:02:32.194 --> 00:02:35.264
<i>is something
that we can use as a model.</i>

50
00:02:35.898 --> 00:02:39.268
<i>But it isn't necessarily
what is going on.</i>

51
00:02:39.402 --> 00:02:40.568
<i>and I think that's important.</i>

52
00:02:40.803 --> 00:02:43.672
That we can use it
and we can understand

53
00:02:43.806 --> 00:02:44.974
that's what's going on.

54
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.344
but we aren't necessarily
in a server room somewhere.

55
00:02:48.476 --> 00:02:49.845
It might be something different.

56
00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:52.882
You know. if you run into
a thing in the world

57
00:02:53.015 --> 00:02:55.217
<i>that you don't understand.
your brain is gonna go.</i>

58
00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:57.552
<i>"Okay. maybe
this is what this is."</i>

59
00:02:58.054 --> 00:03:00.622
<i>And as technology
gets more advanced</i>

60
00:03:00.923 --> 00:03:02.524
we'll have better ways
of describing it.

61
00:03:02.757 --> 00:03:04.492
<i>So.
everything that I describe here</i>

62
00:03:05.227 --> 00:03:08.864
<i>keep in mind. you know.
I'm a 21st Century guy.</i>

63
00:03:08.998 --> 00:03:10.498
<i>that's how my brain works.</i>

64
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.336
<i>If you're watching this
in the future. we aren't dumb.</i>

65
00:03:13.468 --> 00:03:15.637
<i>it's just that we don't have
the tools that you have</i>

66
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:16.939
<i>to think of this stuff.</i>

67
00:03:28.918 --> 00:03:31.153
<i>In September of 1977.</i>

68
00:03:31.287 --> 00:03:34.723
<i>the writer Philip K. Dick.</i>
<i>creator of</i> Minority Report.

69
00:03:34.857 --> 00:03:36.725
Blade Runner.
<i>and</i> Total Recall.

70
00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.494
<i>addressed an audience of fans
in Metz. France.</i>

71
00:03:39.962 --> 00:03:42.465
<i>They expected a talk
about science fiction but his</i>

72
00:03:42.597 --> 00:03:45.835
<i>lecture explored religion
and philosophy as well.</i>

73
00:03:46.268 --> 00:03:49.805
<i>To him. all three subjects
were deeply interconnected.</i>

74
00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:59.647
The title of my address is...

75
00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:02.251
"If you find this world bad.

76
00:04:02.617 --> 00:04:04.153
you should see
some of the others."

77
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.758
The subject of this speech...

78
00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:17.867
is a topic which has been
discovered recently.

79
00:04:18.767 --> 00:04:20.568
and which may not exist at all.

80
00:04:20.702 --> 00:04:22.238
I may be talking
about something

81
00:04:22.371 --> 00:04:23.372
that does not exist.

82
00:04:23.973 --> 00:04:26.809
Therefore. I am free to say
everything or nothing.

83
00:04:32.547 --> 00:04:36.584
We are living in
a computer programmed reality

84
00:04:36.786 --> 00:04:39.155
and the only clue
we have to it

85
00:04:39.288 --> 00:04:41.756
<i>is when some variable
is changed.</i>

86
00:04:42.324 --> 00:04:46.262
and some alteration
in our reality occurs.

87
00:04:50.232 --> 00:04:51.801
<i>Philip K. Dick's belief</i>

88
00:04:51.934 --> 00:04:53.536
<i>that we were living in
a digitally created.</i>

89
00:04:53.668 --> 00:04:57.705
<i>artificial world
sounded like madness in 1977.</i>

90
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.676
<i>But then in 1999.</i>
The Matrix <i>introduced</i>

91
00:05:01.811 --> 00:05:04.280
<i>simulation theory
to the wider world.</i>

92
00:05:10.453 --> 00:05:13.189
<i>In the years since the film.
this idea has begun</i>

93
00:05:13.322 --> 00:05:16.058
<i>to be taken seriously
as more than science fiction.</i>

94
00:05:16.591 --> 00:05:19.228
<i>It is fiercely debated online
and in real life</i>

95
00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:23.598
<i>in classrooms. laboratories.
design studios and courtrooms.</i>

96
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.733
So the idea is right.

97
00:05:25.868 --> 00:05:27.369
any sufficiently
advanced civilization

98
00:05:27.503 --> 00:05:32.108
could create simulation
that's like our existence.

99
00:05:32.475 --> 00:05:33.741
and so the theory follows

100
00:05:33.876 --> 00:05:36.744
that maybe
we're in the simulation.

101
00:05:37.346 --> 00:05:39.014
- Have you thought about this?
- A lot.

102
00:05:39.148 --> 00:05:40.748
And are we...

103
00:05:41.016 --> 00:05:46.055
I am actually in a simulation.
and so are you.

104
00:05:50.625 --> 00:05:52.161
So. are we living
in a simulation?

105
00:05:52.461 --> 00:05:57.466
I find it hard to argue
against that possibility.

106
00:05:57.833 --> 00:06:01.769
<i>If all of this is some kind
of informational process</i>

107
00:06:01.904 --> 00:06:03.439
running in some machine.

108
00:06:04.173 --> 00:06:06.708
<i>The machine is not
in this universe.</i>

109
00:06:06.842 --> 00:06:08.144
<i>it's somewhere else.</i>

110
00:06:08.477 --> 00:06:10.846
<i>and this universe is
a consequence of its running.</i>

111
00:06:22.625 --> 00:06:25.594
This is kind of getting that
artifacting or whatever problem.

112
00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:28.097
<i>Brother Mystwood.
hey. how are you?</i>

113
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.834
Hello. I am sorry about
the strange lighting.

114
00:06:33.202 --> 00:06:34.637
All I have is Christmas lights.

115
00:06:35.371 --> 00:06:37.772
You talked about. you know.
sort of this journey

116
00:06:37.907 --> 00:06:40.910
starting after a spade
of synchronicities.

117
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.112
- What were those like?
- Yes.

118
00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:45.548
There's a number of rather
small examples.

119
00:06:46.015 --> 00:06:48.217
You know. the kind of everyday
things that you would.

120
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:50.953
you know...
I'm thinking of someone.

121
00:06:51.086 --> 00:06:53.856
<i>and I turn the corner
and there they are.</i>

122
00:06:57.426 --> 00:07:01.330
I would start giving myself
sort of tests.

123
00:07:02.831 --> 00:07:04.200
I'm thinking of an orange fish.

124
00:07:04.667 --> 00:07:06.969
<i>I would like to see an orange
fish in the next 10 minutes.</i>

125
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.305
<i>And 10 minutes later
in the walk.</i>

126
00:07:09.438 --> 00:07:10.705
<i>I turn down a street</i>

127
00:07:11.073 --> 00:07:12.074
<i>and there's a restaurant
with an orange fish on it</i>

128
00:07:12.208 --> 00:07:13.042
<i>that I'd never seen before.</i>

129
00:07:14.709 --> 00:07:18.147
So. small things like that
occur with enough regularity.

130
00:07:18.614 --> 00:07:23.052
I began to sort of track
my days numerically.

131
00:07:23.786 --> 00:07:25.020
And if you'll allow me to go

132
00:07:25.154 --> 00:07:27.122
on a tangent a little bit here.
Rodney.

133
00:07:27.256 --> 00:07:29.959
I don't enjoy the average
five-day week.

134
00:07:30.092 --> 00:07:33.462
I like to work in weeks
of 12 days.

135
00:07:38.067 --> 00:07:39.568
I would notice that sort
of on every 12th day

136
00:07:39.702 --> 00:07:41.470
<i>I would see a certain
type of thing pop up</i>

137
00:07:41.604 --> 00:07:44.506
<i>and I tracked this over the
course of about a year.</i>

138
00:07:45.407 --> 00:07:47.676
<i>And long story short.
started to notice</i>

139
00:07:48.277 --> 00:07:53.015
you know. things that would pop
up with a certain regularity.

140
00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:57.519
You know. on every third day.
for instance. I would kind of...

141
00:07:57.686 --> 00:07:59.855
<i>that would be when something
would happen</i>

142
00:08:00.556 --> 00:08:02.057
<i>sort of related to my career.</i>

143
00:08:02.191 --> 00:08:04.860
Or every fifth day
I would notice an interesting

144
00:08:04.994 --> 00:08:06.929
synchronicity related
to my family.

145
00:08:07.062 --> 00:08:08.264
<i>so on and so forth.</i>

146
00:08:08.397 --> 00:08:09.965
<i>And at a certain point
of course.</i>

147
00:08:10.099 --> 00:08:12.701
what becomes hard to delineate.
is this regularity

148
00:08:12.835 --> 00:08:16.538
something that I'm noticing
or something that I'm making?

149
00:08:16.672 --> 00:08:18.641
You know. is it a Schrodinger
type of situation.

150
00:08:18.773 --> 00:08:21.277
where just by virtue
of staring at this thing.

151
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.078
it becomes something
that it's not.

152
00:08:24.079 --> 00:08:25.948
One of the big things was

153
00:08:26.282 --> 00:08:30.152
that I would go to a lot
of places with my parents

154
00:08:30.753 --> 00:08:32.321
and they would be empty.

155
00:08:36.125 --> 00:08:37.593
<i>Or very few people.</i>

156
00:08:38.761 --> 00:08:41.897
<i>Like a shopping mall with not
a lot of people in there.</i>

157
00:08:46.402 --> 00:08:50.272
<i>Driving down the road
and never seeing another car.</i>

158
00:08:50.506 --> 00:08:51.573
<i>Things like that.</i>

159
00:08:52.641 --> 00:08:55.010
<i>This is because I moved
from Pontiac. Illinois.</i>

160
00:08:55.144 --> 00:08:58.480
<i>which had more people.</i>

161
00:08:58.881 --> 00:09:02.084
<i>to Dorsey. Illinois.
which had like 500 people.</i>

162
00:09:02.351 --> 00:09:03.819
<i>Our nearest neighbor was
a quarter of a mile</i>

163
00:09:03.952 --> 00:09:05.287
<i>down the road
and all that.</i>

164
00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:07.823
<i>So I didn't interact
with a lot of people.</i>

165
00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:11.960
<i>And one of the things
that I thought.</i>

166
00:09:12.094 --> 00:09:13.696
<i>again. this is in my little.
you know.</i>

167
00:09:13.829 --> 00:09:15.998
<i>I moved there when I was in
like second grade...</i>

168
00:09:16.632 --> 00:09:18.467
<i>In my little brain
I was like. "A-ha!</i>

169
00:09:18.734 --> 00:09:22.137
<i>This is a great way
of saving time and money</i>

170
00:09:22.271 --> 00:09:25.074
<i>because they won't need
to have as many people."</i>

171
00:09:29.278 --> 00:09:31.280
<i>Occasionally. I would
go to St. Louis...</i>

172
00:09:32.281 --> 00:09:33.783
<i>which was about 50 miles away.</i>

173
00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:37.286
<i>But whenever we did.
my Dad had a very tight control</i>

174
00:09:37.619 --> 00:09:39.955
<i>over our schedule
and our itinerary. you know.</i>

175
00:09:40.089 --> 00:09:42.725
<i>Once I saw...</i>

176
00:09:42.891 --> 00:09:44.393
<i>...the idea of a facade.</i>

177
00:09:45.394 --> 00:09:47.496
<i>you know. this is
on a western movie thing.</i>

178
00:09:47.996 --> 00:09:49.531
<i>Once I saw the idea of it.</i>

179
00:09:49.665 --> 00:09:51.433
<i>I was like. "Oh. well.
that's what's happening."</i>

180
00:09:52.334 --> 00:09:54.436
<i>All this time that
we're spending in the car.</i>

181
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:57.573
<i>this 50 minutes
that it takes us.</i>

182
00:09:58.073 --> 00:09:59.341
<i>we're inside this car</i>

183
00:09:59.775 --> 00:10:03.479
<i>they're playing. you know.
this film of us driving</i>

184
00:10:03.612 --> 00:10:06.615
<i>while they're changing all the
sets into the St. Louis set.</i>

185
00:10:11.887 --> 00:10:15.391
<i>But I'm not gonna get to go
and see everything</i>

186
00:10:15.524 --> 00:10:17.926
<i>because my dad is gonna
be there to make sure</i>

187
00:10:18.093 --> 00:10:19.995
<i>that we hit the points
we're supposed to hit</i>

188
00:10:20.162 --> 00:10:22.264
<i>and then we get back in the car
and we go.</i>

189
00:10:29.204 --> 00:10:31.206
Can you see me? There!

190
00:10:31.841 --> 00:10:36.813
I am an East Coaster
who lives in Los Angeles.

191
00:10:37.579 --> 00:10:40.015
I have an electrical
engineering degree from Harvard.

192
00:10:40.315 --> 00:10:41.417
I'm an entrepreneur.

193
00:10:41.885 --> 00:10:43.685
And I've also...

194
00:10:45.187 --> 00:10:47.022
I've got Crohn's disease.

195
00:10:47.289 --> 00:10:51.760
And it all plays in
to the simulation.

196
00:10:52.294 --> 00:10:55.731
I think the sort of
basic idea is that

197
00:10:56.131 --> 00:10:57.966
if you believed it enough...

198
00:10:59.601 --> 00:11:01.537
incredibly high-power
computing devices

199
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:04.640
are gonna be distributed
in society

200
00:11:04.773 --> 00:11:07.509
and that the computers
will get stronger and stronger

201
00:11:07.643 --> 00:11:08.710
like our cell phones...

202
00:11:08.845 --> 00:11:11.146
Hey. you guys! Hey! No! Quiet!

203
00:11:12.314 --> 00:11:15.617
So. you know. if there are
in fact...

204
00:11:17.453 --> 00:11:20.924
enough machines that are running

205
00:11:21.156 --> 00:11:23.258
video game-style
world simulations

206
00:11:23.692 --> 00:11:26.962
the question is. you know. if
there's that many fake realities

207
00:11:27.095 --> 00:11:28.530
and only one base reality.

208
00:11:28.832 --> 00:11:31.967
what are the chances that you
happen to be in base reality?

209
00:11:32.434 --> 00:11:34.036
The odds that we're
in base reality

210
00:11:34.169 --> 00:11:35.337
is one in billions.

211
00:11:40.075 --> 00:11:42.478
<i>The most
influential statistics-based</i>

212
00:11:42.611 --> 00:11:46.048
<i>look at simulation theory
was a 2003 article</i>

213
00:11:46.181 --> 00:11:48.383
<i>by Oxford professor
Nick Bostrom.</i>

214
00:11:48.785 --> 00:11:52.688
<i>It was titled "Are You Living
in a Computer Simulation?"</i>

215
00:11:56.992 --> 00:11:59.361
Well. I was at the time a...

216
00:12:00.429 --> 00:12:03.599
kind of post-doctoral fellow
at Yale University.

217
00:12:03.833 --> 00:12:05.100
The ideas in some vague form

218
00:12:05.234 --> 00:12:07.736
have been with me
for quite some time

219
00:12:07.971 --> 00:12:11.206
that amounted to something more
than just idle speculation.

220
00:12:11.773 --> 00:12:12.876
And so I wrote that up

221
00:12:13.208 --> 00:12:15.410
<i>and published that in</i>
Philosophical Quarterly.

222
00:12:16.478 --> 00:12:20.516
<i>And it immediately evoked
a huge amount of interest.</i>

223
00:12:20.917 --> 00:12:24.553
<i>And has continued to be
a huge amount of interest.</i>

224
00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.689
<i>It seems to come in waves
every year or two.</i>

225
00:12:27.824 --> 00:12:31.460
<i>Some new set of people
discover it for the first time.</i>

226
00:12:32.661 --> 00:12:35.397
So I make a distinction between
the simulation hypothesis

227
00:12:35.531 --> 00:12:37.834
<i>which is the hypothesis
that we are literally</i>

228
00:12:37.967 --> 00:12:39.969
<i>in a computer simulation
engineered</i>

229
00:12:40.235 --> 00:12:41.703
<i>by some advanced civilization.</i>

230
00:12:41.905 --> 00:12:43.372
And the simulation argument.

231
00:12:43.739 --> 00:12:46.910
<i>And it uses some simple
probability theory.</i>

232
00:12:47.042 --> 00:12:49.812
<i>but the basic idea can be
quite easily grasped.</i>

233
00:12:50.145 --> 00:12:53.682
Which is that at least one
of three propositions is true.

234
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:58.587
The first alternative is that
most all civilizations

235
00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.256
<i>at our current stage
of technological development</i>

236
00:13:01.991 --> 00:13:05.627
<i>go extinct before they reach
technological maturity.</i>

237
00:13:10.465 --> 00:13:12.301
The second alternative is
that there is

238
00:13:12.467 --> 00:13:14.069
a very strong convergence

239
00:13:14.436 --> 00:13:17.706
in virtually all technologically
mature civilizations

240
00:13:17.874 --> 00:13:19.741
<i>in that they all lose interest</i>

241
00:13:19.876 --> 00:13:23.111
<i>in creating simulations
of this kind.</i>

242
00:13:23.345 --> 00:13:24.613
<i>They all lose interest</i>

243
00:13:24.781 --> 00:13:26.181
<i>in creating
ancestor simulations.</i>

244
00:13:26.615 --> 00:13:28.450
And the third alternative
is the simulation hypothesis

245
00:13:28.584 --> 00:13:31.453
<i>that we are almost certainly
in a computer simulation.</i>

246
00:13:33.221 --> 00:13:37.225
So if you reject these first two
propositions. it follows that

247
00:13:38.193 --> 00:13:42.598
almost all people with our kinds
of experience are simulated.

248
00:13:42.832 --> 00:13:45.701
<i>And then. conditional on that
being the case. I argue</i>

249
00:13:45.868 --> 00:13:48.337
<i>we should think we are probably
one of the simulated ones</i>

250
00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:51.007
<i>rather than one
of the non-simulated.</i>

251
00:13:51.173 --> 00:13:52.574
<i>exceptional. original ones.</i>

252
00:13:53.076 --> 00:13:55.477
Personally. for me.
it's all about probabilities.

253
00:13:55.611 --> 00:14:01.283
I'm someone who thinks in terms
of probabilities. anyway.

254
00:14:01.985 --> 00:14:04.686
And I've just found in my life

255
00:14:04.821 --> 00:14:08.091
that there's lots
of low probability outcomes

256
00:14:08.523 --> 00:14:10.860
happen again and again
and again. and again.

257
00:14:18.533 --> 00:14:19.468
Bam.

258
00:14:19.635 --> 00:14:21.203
If I keep glancing off
to the side.

259
00:14:21.336 --> 00:14:23.106
it's 'cause my screen's
over there.

260
00:14:23.238 --> 00:14:24.172
<i>Oh. okay.</i>

261
00:14:24.506 --> 00:14:26.042
You're actually
at my drawing table.

262
00:14:26.174 --> 00:14:27.175
So. if I keep
glancing over there.

263
00:14:27.309 --> 00:14:28.577
I'm just looking at you.

264
00:14:29.478 --> 00:14:30.712
And I'll look back to camera.

265
00:14:30.847 --> 00:14:32.481
<i>What kind of drawing do you do?</i>

266
00:14:34.483 --> 00:14:37.653
- It depends. You know Moebius?
- <i>Sure.</i>

267
00:14:37.954 --> 00:14:40.957
Yeah. I re-drew one
of his entire books

268
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:45.394
<i>with characters from</i> Peanuts
<i>instead of characters from him.</i>

269
00:14:45.895 --> 00:14:48.764
And then I just do
painting and stuff like...

270
00:14:49.431 --> 00:14:52.802
just doodling like
fake Mignola stuff.

271
00:14:53.136 --> 00:14:54.070
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

272
00:14:54.636 --> 00:14:57.006
Nothing that wonderful. but...

273
00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.374
I'm working more
on the Moebius-style

274
00:14:59.508 --> 00:15:01.110
for an entire new book
right now.

275
00:15:01.243 --> 00:15:03.880
<i>That's cool.
So. are you a full-time...</i>

276
00:15:04.379 --> 00:15:06.214
- <i>professional comic artist?</i>
- No. no.

277
00:15:06.816 --> 00:15:10.086
I wish. No. I do
Special Ed teaching.

278
00:15:10.953 --> 00:15:12.654
<i>When did you start
thinking that there's more</i>

279
00:15:12.789 --> 00:15:15.424
<i>to simulation theory
than Science Fiction can see?</i>

280
00:15:15.892 --> 00:15:19.028
Well. we know Musk. When he
started talking about it

281
00:15:19.996 --> 00:15:21.630
I really started
thinking about it more.

282
00:15:22.031 --> 00:15:25.534
The strongest argument
for us being in a simulation...

283
00:15:25.667 --> 00:15:27.904
probably being in a simulation.
I think is the following.

284
00:15:29.604 --> 00:15:33.943
<i>That 40 years ago. we had Pong.</i>

285
00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:35.812
<i>Like two rectangles and a dot.</i>

286
00:15:36.145 --> 00:15:37.880
<i>That was what games were.</i>

287
00:15:39.048 --> 00:15:40.415
Now. 40 years later.

288
00:15:40.549 --> 00:15:43.385
we have photo-realistic
3D simulations

289
00:15:43.518 --> 00:15:45.420
<i>with millions of people
playing simultaneously.</i>

290
00:15:45.721 --> 00:15:47.056
<i>And it's getting better
every year.</i>

291
00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:50.893
<i>If you assume any rate
of improvement at all</i>

292
00:15:52.028 --> 00:15:55.564
<i>then the games will become
indistinguishable from reality.</i>

293
00:16:00.402 --> 00:16:04.974
I think that triggered me
to really think hard about it.

294
00:16:12.181 --> 00:16:15.350
Does any one of us remember
in any dim fashion

295
00:16:15.717 --> 00:16:19.354
a worse Earth. circa 1977.
than this?

296
00:16:19.822 --> 00:16:23.525
Have our young men seen visions
and our old men dreamed dreams?

297
00:16:23.692 --> 00:16:24.459
I have.

298
00:16:25.128 --> 00:16:28.663
<i>Nightmare dreams. specifically.
of prisons and jailers</i>

299
00:16:29.065 --> 00:16:30.800
<i>and ubiquitous police.</i>

300
00:16:33.268 --> 00:16:37.240
<i>I wrote out these dreams
in novel after novel.</i>

301
00:16:37.506 --> 00:16:38.774
<i>story after story.</i>

302
00:16:39.108 --> 00:16:41.944
<i>To name two in which
this prior ugly present</i>

303
00:16:42.078 --> 00:16:43.179
<i>obtained most clearly.</i>

304
00:16:43.411 --> 00:16:45.148
<i>I cite</i>
The Man in the High Castle

305
00:16:45.447 --> 00:16:49.384
<i>and my 1974 novel about
the US as a police state</i>

306
00:16:49.651 --> 00:16:52.054
<i>called</i> Flow My Tears.
The Policeman Said.

307
00:16:52.721 --> 00:16:54.891
I'm going to be very candid
with you.

308
00:16:55.191 --> 00:16:59.327
I wrote both novels based on
fragmentary residual memories

309
00:16:59.494 --> 00:17:01.563
of such a horrid
slave state world.

310
00:17:02.031 --> 00:17:04.299
Or perhaps the term "world"
is the wrong one

311
00:17:04.432 --> 00:17:06.035
and I should say
"United States".

312
00:17:06.368 --> 00:17:07.569
since in both novels.

313
00:17:07.702 --> 00:17:09.604
I was writing
about my own country.

314
00:17:10.705 --> 00:17:12.774
Some people claim
to remember past lives.

315
00:17:12.909 --> 00:17:16.344
I claim to remember
a very different present life.

316
00:17:16.979 --> 00:17:20.216
I know of no one who has ever
made this claim before.

317
00:17:20.382 --> 00:17:21.516
but I rather suspect

318
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:23.485
that my experience
is not unique.

319
00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.621
I can even tell you
what caused me to remember.

320
00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:31.127
<i>In late February of 1974.
I was given sodium pentothal</i>

321
00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.628
<i>for the extraction
of impacted wisdom teeth.</i>

322
00:17:34.063 --> 00:17:36.665
<i>Later that day. back home again
but still</i>

323
00:17:36.799 --> 00:17:39.501
<i>deeply under the influence
of the sodium pentothal.</i>

324
00:17:39.768 --> 00:17:42.704
<i>I had a short. acute flash
of recovered memory.</i>

325
00:17:43.239 --> 00:17:45.407
<i>In one instance.
I caught it all.</i>

326
00:17:45.842 --> 00:17:48.811
You are free to believe me
or to disbelieve.

327
00:17:49.111 --> 00:17:51.680
but please take my word on it
that I am not joking.

328
00:17:51.814 --> 00:17:54.716
This is very serious.
a matter of importance.

329
00:17:55.084 --> 00:17:57.619
I am sure that.
at the very least. you'll agree

330
00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:01.523
that for me even to claim this
is in itself amazing.

331
00:18:04.759 --> 00:18:07.529
<i>Philip K. Dick

00:18:25.014 --> 00:18:27.950
<i>wrestled with this text
to edit a single book from it.</i>

339
00:18:29.852 --> 00:18:31.320
It was a great experience.

340
00:18:31.686 --> 00:18:35.224
although a kind of
crazy-making one in a way.

341
00:18:35.358 --> 00:18:40.695
<i>And you're in the antechamber
of the guy's problems</i>

342
00:18:40.863 --> 00:18:44.432
<i>and his trauma.
and his despair.</i>

343
00:18:44.666 --> 00:18:47.003
<i>It was so... such a vast text</i>

344
00:18:47.136 --> 00:18:50.339
<i>that you kinda had to do it
by attrition. really.</i>

345
00:18:50.472 --> 00:18:52.574
<i>There were a number of things
that really worked.</i>

346
00:18:52.707 --> 00:18:54.643
<i>One is that
when he was really engaged</i>

347
00:18:54.777 --> 00:18:55.945
<i>in his own writing...</i>

348
00:18:56.112 --> 00:18:57.545
<i>...we included that.</i>

349
00:18:57.712 --> 00:18:59.481
<i>When he was
describing experiences.</i>

350
00:18:59.614 --> 00:19:00.783
<i>we included that.</i>

351
00:19:01.017 --> 00:19:02.450
<i>There's a part where</i>

352
00:19:02.818 --> 00:19:05.553
<i>Dick describes the writing in
"Exegesis" as a "hell chore".</i>

353
00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.257
<i>I think it really shows
the challenges</i>

354
00:19:08.391 --> 00:19:11.493
<i>of wrestling with
an extraordinary experience.</i>

355
00:19:11.626 --> 00:19:13.095
<i>and particularly experiences</i>

356
00:19:13.262 --> 00:19:16.198
<i>which we can find throughout
religious history</i>

357
00:19:16.332 --> 00:19:20.102
<i>of seeming insights
into reality that.</i>

358
00:19:20.269 --> 00:19:22.437
<i>for whatever positive vision
they give you</i>

359
00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:24.106
<i>about the true
nature of things.</i>

360
00:19:24.673 --> 00:19:26.075
<i>do manage to undermine</i>

361
00:19:26.309 --> 00:19:28.210
<i>your sense
that the everyday world</i>

362
00:19:28.344 --> 00:19:33.448
<i>is at all a coherent.
realistic operation.</i>

363
00:19:33.648 --> 00:19:37.119
<i>And that's quite
a harrowing ride.</i>

364
00:19:44.827 --> 00:19:46.095
I could probably put together
a list

365
00:19:46.228 --> 00:19:49.698
of all the various
small synchronicities

366
00:19:49.832 --> 00:19:51.067
that kept popping up.

367
00:19:51.566 --> 00:19:53.501
but they were just so mundane.
but there was so many of them

368
00:19:53.635 --> 00:19:57.039
that eventually
I took one of these.

369
00:19:57.539 --> 00:19:59.641
you know. a particularly
auspicious day.

370
00:19:59.774 --> 00:20:01.177
I guess. for myself.

371
00:20:01.609 --> 00:20:04.880
<i>And decided I was going to do
a sensory deprivation tank.</i>

372
00:20:06.215 --> 00:20:08.250
<i>Which is not something
I had done before.</i>

373
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.086
<i>But it was just...</i>

374
00:20:11.287 --> 00:20:15.157
<i>something that felt like it'd
be an interesting experience.</i>

375
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:16.826
<i>And so. I did that.</i>

376
00:20:17.059 --> 00:20:19.462
<i>And there's a guy
in New York here.</i>

377
00:20:19.627 --> 00:20:20.896
<i>on 23rd Street</i>

378
00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:22.264
<i>who has
a sensory deprivation tank</i>

379
00:20:22.398 --> 00:20:23.665
<i>in his apartment.</i>

380
00:20:23.866 --> 00:20:25.201
<i>which is a strange thing.
but you go in.</i>

381
00:20:25.334 --> 00:20:27.069
he gives you the spiel.

382
00:20:27.436 --> 00:20:29.537
You ask him any questions.
and then you go into it.

383
00:20:30.473 --> 00:20:32.674
<i>And I. never having
had done this before.</i>

384
00:20:32.808 --> 00:20:34.743
<i>I kind of went into it</i>

385
00:20:34.877 --> 00:20:36.379
<i>not really knowing
what to expect.</i>

386
00:20:36.544 --> 00:20:38.280
<i>But he said. just sort of
ask for what you want</i>

387
00:20:38.414 --> 00:20:40.715
<i>or ask for. you know.
what you'd like to know.</i>

388
00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:42.985
<i>And the sense I got was like.</i>

389
00:20:43.119 --> 00:20:44.753
<i>"Yes. I'm asking the universe.
or whatever</i>

390
00:20:44.887 --> 00:20:46.322
<i>but I'm also really
asking myself."</i>

391
00:20:46.455 --> 00:20:49.859
<i>And maybe those aren't
different things. right?</i>

392
00:20:58.934 --> 00:21:00.469
<i>The first few minutes
were very...</i>

393
00:21:01.404 --> 00:21:03.372
<i>I was very aware
of where I was.</i>

394
00:21:03.506 --> 00:21:04.807
<i>But after a few more minutes.</i>

395
00:21:05.408 --> 00:21:07.910
<i>I sort of stopped
sensing my body.</i>

396
00:21:08.144 --> 00:21:10.813
<i>I could now hear my eyelids.</i>

397
00:21:11.013 --> 00:21:12.614
<i>I could actually hear
what I thought might be</i>

398
00:21:12.747 --> 00:21:14.150
<i>my nervous system.</i>

399
00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:17.219
<i>I kinda. in that state.
had to come out. and said.</i>

400
00:21:17.619 --> 00:21:18.988
<i>"Listen. I get the sense</i>

401
00:21:19.121 --> 00:21:20.790
<i>that you're trying
to tell me something."</i>

402
00:21:21.357 --> 00:21:23.959
<i>I'm not sure I even knew who
the "you" was I was talking to.</i>

403
00:21:24.093 --> 00:21:26.128
<i>I don't know if it was
the universe or...</i>

404
00:21:26.462 --> 00:21:29.764
<i>I'm also an ordained minister.
so I was raised with that.</i>

405
00:21:30.332 --> 00:21:31.566
<i>So there's. you know.</i>

406
00:21:31.699 --> 00:21:33.235
<i>there's a
God part of it for me.</i>

407
00:21:36.472 --> 00:21:37.840
<i>Just sort of asking it.</i>

408
00:21:37.973 --> 00:21:39.308
<i>come out. just come out</i>

409
00:21:39.442 --> 00:21:41.077
<i>and do what it is
you'd like to say.</i>

410
00:21:54.123 --> 00:21:57.093
Yeah. and I'm not
a New Age guy at all.

411
00:21:57.226 --> 00:21:58.928
Or at least I wasn't
before I did this.

412
00:21:59.061 --> 00:22:01.864
But my head started to buzz.

413
00:22:02.131 --> 00:22:05.468
My forehead just started
to violent pounding.

414
00:22:05.667 --> 00:22:08.636
<i>A swirling buzz that I...</i>

415
00:22:08.971 --> 00:22:10.705
<i>I felt like I opened up.</i>

416
00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.575
<i>and I just
became aware like. "Okay</i>

417
00:22:13.042 --> 00:22:15.344
<i>I am not a body at all.
I am a code.</i>

418
00:22:15.544 --> 00:22:17.913
<i>I am a string of letters
and numbers</i>

419
00:22:18.047 --> 00:22:19.415
<i>and acids. and so forth.</i>

420
00:22:19.548 --> 00:22:21.150
<i>And I knew this. of course.
from DNA.</i>

421
00:22:21.283 --> 00:22:24.286
<i>but more than that.
it means. you know.</i>

422
00:22:24.854 --> 00:22:28.357
<i>nothing on me is real."</i>

423
00:22:29.125 --> 00:22:30.692
<i>And nothing on anyone is real.</i>

424
00:22:30.826 --> 00:22:33.395
<i>I'm pattern. I'm a code
constantly replicating itself.</i>

425
00:22:33.529 --> 00:22:36.232
<i>I'm a vibration.
and that's what it is.</i>

426
00:22:36.398 --> 00:22:37.632
<i>Got out of the tank</i>

427
00:22:37.833 --> 00:22:39.268
<i>and I started talking
to the guy.</i>

428
00:22:41.103 --> 00:22:42.304
<i>And he was talking about.</i>

429
00:22:42.438 --> 00:22:43.638
<i>"Oh. it's your
third eye opening</i>

430
00:22:43.771 --> 00:22:45.241
<i>and sometimes that happens"</i>

431
00:22:45.374 --> 00:22:46.976
<i>And I asked him.
"Well. what do I do with that?"</i>

432
00:22:47.109 --> 00:22:48.310
<i>And he's like. "I don't know.
Enjoy it."</i>

433
00:22:50.645 --> 00:22:53.849
I've always had a little bit
of a sense of this.

434
00:22:53.983 --> 00:22:55.717
but this is the big event.

435
00:23:00.089 --> 00:23:01.957
<i>I was about 11 or 12...</i>

436
00:23:02.791 --> 00:23:04.860
<i>and I'm adopted.</i>

437
00:23:05.261 --> 00:23:07.463
<i>I'm a pastor's son.</i>

438
00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:09.598
<i>My adopted dad
is a pastor.</i>

439
00:23:09.731 --> 00:23:11.133
<i>so I go to church every Sunday.</i>

440
00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.903
<i>And I believe at this point
in time. though.</i>

441
00:23:14.036 --> 00:23:15.404
<i>it wasn't a Sunday service.</i>

442
00:23:15.538 --> 00:23:16.738
<i>I think it was like
an Advent service.</i>

443
00:23:16.872 --> 00:23:17.940
<i>It was at nighttime.</i>

444
00:23:18.507 --> 00:23:23.245
<i>And most people have
some reference for church.</i>

445
00:23:23.379 --> 00:23:24.413
<i>but in case you don't.</i>

446
00:23:25.147 --> 00:23:27.249
<i>there are people.
they're dressed up</i>

447
00:23:28.284 --> 00:23:30.553
<i>and they're sitting in...
this is in the early 80s.</i>

448
00:23:30.685 --> 00:23:33.189
<i>so people dressed up more
than they maybe do now.</i>

449
00:23:33.522 --> 00:23:37.293
<i>And they're seating in pews.
Pews are like long benches.</i>

450
00:23:38.127 --> 00:23:39.428
<i>And they have
their hymnals open.</i>

451
00:23:39.562 --> 00:23:40.462
<i>and they're singing.</i>

452
00:23:42.131 --> 00:23:44.967
<i>And I look around
at everyone singing</i>

453
00:23:45.733 --> 00:23:50.239
<i>and I think to myself. "The way
we're making these noises.</i>

454
00:23:50.772 --> 00:23:55.144
<i>is that we have these meat
flaps and we're forcing air</i>

455
00:23:55.277 --> 00:23:57.813
<i>through these meat flaps
and we're making noise.</i>

456
00:23:58.214 --> 00:23:59.882
<i>And we're animals. basically.</i>

457
00:24:00.015 --> 00:24:02.117
<i>yet we put on all these clothes</i>

458
00:24:02.284 --> 00:24:05.487
<i>and we sit in this place.
and we're making these noises</i>

459
00:24:05.621 --> 00:24:07.289
<i>by forcing air
through our meat flaps."</i>

460
00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:10.259
<i>and I start thinking about
how bodies move</i>

461
00:24:10.526 --> 00:24:12.760
<i>and how weird it is
that they move that way.</i>

462
00:24:13.028 --> 00:24:14.897
<i>And just the absurdity
of the situation</i>

463
00:24:15.231 --> 00:24:16.966
<i>keeps on going around.
around in my head.</i>

464
00:24:17.299 --> 00:24:19.935
<i>And I'm like.
"Oh. none of this is real.</i>

465
00:24:20.069 --> 00:24:21.370
<i>That's what's going on."</i>

466
00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:23.239
<i>And as soon as I had
that realization.</i>

467
00:24:23.505 --> 00:24:25.574
<i>the only way
I can describe it is.</i>

468
00:24:25.841 --> 00:24:28.611
<i>I was nowhere. I was nothing.</i>

469
00:24:29.744 --> 00:24:33.349
<i>I felt sort of like
loneliness was a thing.</i>

470
00:24:33.482 --> 00:24:35.884
<i>I was the
personification of it.</i>

471
00:24:36.118 --> 00:24:39.021
<i>I was cut off from everything.
It was only me.</i>

472
00:24:39.822 --> 00:24:43.892
<i>And it was soul-crushing
and claustrophobic.</i>

473
00:24:44.526 --> 00:24:47.930
<i>But I didn't see anything.
It wasn't that I saw blackness.</i>

474
00:24:48.063 --> 00:24:50.733
<i>I wasn't seeing
and I wasn't feeling.</i>

475
00:24:50.899 --> 00:24:54.136
<i>It was this
almost negation of self</i>

476
00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:55.838
<i>except that I was there</i>

477
00:24:56.205 --> 00:25:00.442
<i>feeling this weird emptiness.
this gone-ness.</i>

478
00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:11.287
My entire life.
I'm living with family.

479
00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:14.189
and I'm real used to it.
Specifically. my brother.

480
00:25:15.658 --> 00:25:17.126
And then I go off.

481
00:25:17.593 --> 00:25:19.928
You know. the parents
are always like. "You're 18.

482
00:25:20.062 --> 00:25:21.163
We're kicking you out."

483
00:25:21.563 --> 00:25:23.165
But I kinda beat them
to the punch

484
00:25:23.299 --> 00:25:25.367
because. like.
the day after graduation.

485
00:25:25.501 --> 00:25:26.535
I was out of town.

486
00:25:26.735 --> 00:25:27.870
I had moved away.

487
00:25:28.003 --> 00:25:29.004
And I didn't come back
for years.

488
00:25:30.239 --> 00:25:32.875
But during that time.
I was just alone. you know.

489
00:25:33.008 --> 00:25:34.176
I lived with a friend.

490
00:25:34.376 --> 00:25:35.544
but I didn't have
my brother with me.

491
00:25:36.478 --> 00:25:39.581
And all we would do
for like two straight years

492
00:25:39.715 --> 00:25:40.616
<i>is just play video games.</i>

493
00:25:40.749 --> 00:25:42.217
<i>I worked at a Chili's.</i>

494
00:25:43.018 --> 00:25:45.154
<i>and I would always come home.
we would do stupid things</i>

495
00:25:45.287 --> 00:25:49.725
<i>like play</i> Guitar Hero
<i>for two straight days.</i>

496
00:25:49.858 --> 00:25:54.296
<i>or we would get a game
and do it from front to back.</i>

497
00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:56.231
<i>and then just go back in
and just beat it again.</i>

498
00:25:56.899 --> 00:25:59.968
<i>All the time. video games.
for years and years.</i>

499
00:26:00.836 --> 00:26:02.271
<i>that's literally all I did.</i>

500
00:26:03.272 --> 00:26:05.307
<i>Didn't draw.
didn't do anything.</i>

501
00:26:12.448 --> 00:26:14.650
And so I got into
a dark place there.

502
00:26:14.784 --> 00:26:17.821
It's like. "Maybe I'm stuck
in this rut on purpose.

503
00:26:17.953 --> 00:26:20.022
Maybe it's not my design.
It's whatever."

504
00:26:20.189 --> 00:26:21.724
I'm not religious at all.

505
00:26:22.024 --> 00:26:25.761
but how do I reconcile feeling
like I'm in a rut. though?

506
00:26:26.328 --> 00:26:28.497
Like a preprogrammed rut.

507
00:26:28.897 --> 00:26:30.065
I have to go the science route.

508
00:26:30.834 --> 00:26:35.304
And the only really blending
of religion in science there is

509
00:26:35.537 --> 00:26:38.307
would probably be
a simulation theory.

510
00:26:38.941 --> 00:26:40.242
to be honest with you.

511
00:26:42.812 --> 00:26:44.413
<i>When I had that
first experience</i>

512
00:26:44.546 --> 00:26:46.615
<i>in the church.
the analogy that I use is like.</i>

513
00:26:46.749 --> 00:26:50.085
<i>let's say that your grandpa
has a favorite radio.</i>

514
00:26:50.619 --> 00:26:52.421
<i>And he listens to it
all the time. and all that.</i>

515
00:26:52.554 --> 00:26:55.424
<i>And one day. you decide
to take that radio apart.</i>

516
00:26:55.859 --> 00:26:57.626
<i>And you're looking
at all the pieces</i>

517
00:26:58.060 --> 00:26:59.695
<i>and "Hey. hey.
I took this apart."</i>

518
00:26:59.895 --> 00:27:02.598
<i>And then you realize you can't
put it back together again.</i>

519
00:27:03.298 --> 00:27:04.767
<i>That's the feeling that I had</i>

520
00:27:04.967 --> 00:27:07.837
<i>when I was in that sort
of null state. if you will.</i>

521
00:27:08.337 --> 00:27:09.972
<i>And in my mind...</i>

522
00:27:10.874 --> 00:27:15.177
<i>that is what's outside
of the simulation.</i>

523
00:27:24.953 --> 00:27:26.388
Contemplating this possibility

524
00:27:26.522 --> 00:27:28.624
of a lateral arrangement
of worlds.

525
00:27:29.525 --> 00:27:31.360
a plurality
of overlapping Earths

526
00:27:31.493 --> 00:27:34.730
along whose linking axis
a person can somehow move

527
00:27:34.997 --> 00:27:36.532
and travel in a mysterious way

528
00:27:36.665 --> 00:27:38.934
from worst to fair
to good to excellent.

529
00:27:39.301 --> 00:27:41.470
Contemplating this
in theological terms.

530
00:27:41.838 --> 00:27:45.174
<i>perhaps we could say that
here with we suddenly decipher</i>

531
00:27:45.407 --> 00:27:48.010
<i>the elliptical utterances
which Christ expressed</i>

532
00:27:48.143 --> 00:27:49.813
<i>regarding the kingdom of God.</i>

533
00:27:50.112 --> 00:27:51.915
<i>Specifically.
where it is located.</i>

534
00:27:52.514 --> 00:27:54.784
He seems to have given
contradictory

535
00:27:54.918 --> 00:27:55.951
and puzzling answers.

536
00:27:56.385 --> 00:27:58.954
But suppose. just suppose
for an instant

537
00:27:59.488 --> 00:28:01.223
that the cause of the perplexity

538
00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:02.558
lay not in any desire

539
00:28:02.691 --> 00:28:04.593
on his part
to baffle or to hide.

540
00:28:04.828 --> 00:28:06.995
but in the inadequacy
of the question.

541
00:28:07.831 --> 00:28:09.731
<i>"My kingdom is not
of this world."</i>

542
00:28:09.866 --> 00:28:11.200
<i>he is reported to have said.</i>

543
00:28:11.733 --> 00:28:14.838
<i>"The kingdom is within you.
or possibly it is among you."</i>

544
00:28:15.905 --> 00:28:18.474
<i>It was his mission
to teach his disciples</i>

545
00:28:18.774 --> 00:28:22.277
<i>the secret of crossing along
this orthogonal path.</i>

546
00:28:22.744 --> 00:28:25.280
<i>He did not merely report
what lay there.</i>

547
00:28:25.614 --> 00:28:27.349
<i>He taught the method
of getting there.</i>

548
00:28:27.817 --> 00:28:30.052
<i>But. tragically.
the secret was lost.</i>

549
00:28:30.519 --> 00:28:33.088
<i>The enemy. the Roman authority.
crushed it.</i>

550
00:28:34.423 --> 00:28:36.992
<i>When I saw</i> Star Wars
<i>this morning</i>

551
00:28:37.827 --> 00:28:39.061
<i>I thought to myself...</i>

552
00:28:40.362 --> 00:28:41.463
<i>déjà vu.</i>

553
00:28:46.235 --> 00:28:48.872
<i>The simulation idea
has been around way before</i>

554
00:28:49.004 --> 00:28:52.007
<i>all of us started thinking
about computers.</i>

555
00:28:52.441 --> 00:28:55.477
<i>The concept of people standing
at the Pearly Gates</i>

556
00:28:55.611 --> 00:28:57.579
<i>and looking at their lives.
right?</i>

557
00:28:57.881 --> 00:29:02.618
<i>What is that if not
a debrief. if you will.</i>

558
00:29:02.751 --> 00:29:05.420
<i>after you get out
of a simulation?</i>

559
00:29:05.955 --> 00:29:08.257
Hey. Miller. look what I found.

560
00:29:08.457 --> 00:29:09.324
Wow.

561
00:29:10.125 --> 00:29:12.094
Realistic. isn't it. Mr. Miller?

562
00:29:12.561 --> 00:29:15.497
<i>René Descartes
tried to build an epistemology</i>

563
00:29:15.832 --> 00:29:19.101
<i>from a foundation of skepticism
and radical doubt.</i>

564
00:29:19.468 --> 00:29:21.570
<i>I will suppose
that some malicious demon</i>

565
00:29:21.737 --> 00:29:24.072
<i>has employed his energies
to deceive me.</i>

566
00:29:24.773 --> 00:29:27.609
<i>I shall think that the sky.
the air. the earth</i>

567
00:29:27.776 --> 00:29:30.245
<i>and all external things
are merely the delusions</i>

568
00:29:30.379 --> 00:29:32.782
<i>which he has devised
to ensnare my judgement.</i>

569
00:29:33.749 --> 00:29:37.586
<i>I shall consider myself as not
having hands or flesh or senses</i>

570
00:29:37.887 --> 00:29:40.689
<i>but his falsely believing
that I have all these things.</i>

571
00:29:41.323 --> 00:29:43.692
A slightly more modern version
of the same idea

572
00:29:43.826 --> 00:29:45.962
is the brain in a vat.
Where. again.

573
00:29:46.428 --> 00:29:49.431
you try to challenge
the philosopher

574
00:29:49.665 --> 00:29:51.366
<i>to prove that
the external world exists</i>

575
00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:54.570
<i>and that he or she
is not a brain in a vat</i>

576
00:29:54.871 --> 00:29:56.873
<i>in some
mad scientist's laboratory</i>

577
00:29:57.006 --> 00:29:58.875
<i>being kind of fed inputs</i>

578
00:29:59.308 --> 00:30:01.143
<i>that mimic what
the external world</i>

579
00:30:01.276 --> 00:30:02.678
<i>would have done.</i>

580
00:30:13.455 --> 00:30:14.991
<i>It didn't really matter
how realistic</i>

581
00:30:15.123 --> 00:30:16.325
<i>these thought experiments were.</i>

582
00:30:16.458 --> 00:30:17.827
They were just
logical possibilities.

583
00:30:17.994 --> 00:30:20.362
and the challenge was.
how can you disprove them?

584
00:30:24.166 --> 00:30:25.300
<i>One thousand years</i>

585
00:30:25.434 --> 00:30:27.102
<i>before
Descartes' Evil Demon</i>

586
00:30:27.302 --> 00:30:31.139
<i>a similar idea was put forth
in Ancient Greece by Plato.</i>

587
00:30:31.773 --> 00:30:34.242
He describes. "Imagine.
the situation.

588
00:30:34.643 --> 00:30:38.815
There are figures chained
inside of a cave from birth.

589
00:30:38.948 --> 00:30:41.149
They have no experience
of what's outside of it.

590
00:30:41.316 --> 00:30:42.584
<i>They're looking at a wall.</i>

591
00:30:42.952 --> 00:30:44.453
<i>and on the wall they kind
of see this projection."</i>

592
00:30:44.921 --> 00:30:46.856
<i>You see men
passing along the wall.</i>

593
00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:48.825
<i>carrying all sorts of articles</i>

594
00:30:48.958 --> 00:30:51.226
<i>which they hold projected
above the wall.</i>

595
00:30:51.526 --> 00:30:53.595
<i>Statues of men and animals</i>

596
00:30:53.729 --> 00:30:56.531
<i>made of wood and stone
and various materials.</i>

597
00:31:00.435 --> 00:31:03.940
<i>Of the objects. which are
being carried in like manner.</i>

598
00:31:04.473 --> 00:31:06.575
<i>they would only see
the shadows.</i>

599
00:31:07.076 --> 00:31:08.577
<i>Emily Pothast wrote about</i>

600
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:10.345
<i>this parable's relevance</i>

601
00:31:10.512 --> 00:31:12.648
<i>to both simulation theory
and other aspects</i>

602
00:31:12.849 --> 00:31:15.885
<i>of digital communications
and miscommunications.</i>

603
00:31:18.453 --> 00:31:20.322
<i>It's a very cinematic metaphor.</i>

604
00:31:20.455 --> 00:31:21.723
<i>and I just love that.</i>

605
00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:25.028
<i>how that sort of imagination
of how film affects us.</i>

606
00:31:25.761 --> 00:31:28.998
<i>And just like there's
like that lossiness between</i>

607
00:31:29.132 --> 00:31:31.968
<i>what is really happening
and what perception shows us.</i>

608
00:31:32.135 --> 00:31:35.337
<i>there's sort of lossiness
between what media</i>

609
00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:37.506
<i>shows us and what
the real world outside</i>

610
00:31:37.639 --> 00:31:39.641
<i>of that media
representation is.</i>

611
00:31:39.775 --> 00:31:40.877
<i>So now.</i>

612
00:31:41.243 --> 00:31:42.879
<i>it's not just what their senses
decide to show them.</i>

613
00:31:43.012 --> 00:31:44.680
<i>it's what the media
decides to show them.</i>

614
00:31:44.847 --> 00:31:47.482
And this is extremely
dangerous to our democracy.

615
00:31:48.051 --> 00:31:50.719
<i>Let's go back to Hindu myths.</i>

616
00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:57.526
<i>You find these incredible myths
of like. you know.</i>

617
00:31:57.726 --> 00:32:00.897
<i>the king's going along and
stops for a well and he drinks</i>

618
00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:03.398
<i>and then he goes and has
a whole other existence.</i>

619
00:32:03.532 --> 00:32:04.967
<i>a whole other life.</i>

620
00:32:05.233 --> 00:32:06.836
And then pop! He comes back in.

621
00:32:07.003 --> 00:32:09.204
And they'll even have worlds
within worlds within worlds.

622
00:32:09.337 --> 00:32:12.141
<i>So. you have the structure
of worlds within worlds.</i>

623
00:32:12.274 --> 00:32:13.408
<i>and once you have that</i>

624
00:32:13.709 --> 00:32:16.344
it undermines the primary world.

625
00:32:16.611 --> 00:32:18.246
It really kind of
crystalized for me

626
00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:19.816
when I started observing

627
00:32:19.949 --> 00:32:22.584
the experience
of the villager in <i>Minecraft.</i>

628
00:32:23.886 --> 00:32:25.888
<i>He's a massively simplified
version of us.</i>

629
00:32:26.122 --> 00:32:30.059
<i>He has free will. He moves
about the space as he sees fit.</i>

630
00:32:30.325 --> 00:32:31.626
But the interesting thing.
though.

631
00:32:31.794 --> 00:32:33.196
is for me what it was
with the villager is.

632
00:32:33.628 --> 00:32:36.398
<i>you know. what does he do
when you. the avatar</i>

633
00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.401
<i>come down into the game</i>
<i>of</i> Minecraft?

634
00:32:39.601 --> 00:32:41.670
<i>When you inhabit your avatar</i>
<i>in</i> Minecraft

635
00:32:41.804 --> 00:32:43.505
<i>and you descend to Earth.</i>

636
00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:46.909
what does the villager do
when you encounter him?

637
00:32:47.409 --> 00:32:49.311
<i>He looks at you. you know?</i>

638
00:32:49.779 --> 00:32:52.414
He looks at you as if
you are the same as him.

639
00:32:52.547 --> 00:32:54.549
Of course. you're not.
Because you are being controlled

640
00:32:54.917 --> 00:32:56.451
<i>by an intelligence.
a higher power.</i>

641
00:32:57.053 --> 00:32:59.122
<i>It'd be hilarious if Elon Musk</i>

642
00:32:59.254 --> 00:33:00.288
<i>was a player character.</i>

643
00:33:01.157 --> 00:33:02.825
<i>And he just comes
into the game. like.</i>

644
00:33:02.959 --> 00:33:05.995
<i>"Hey. you guys know...
...we're simulated."</i>

645
00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:08.597
This could be some simulation.

646
00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:10.499
It could.
Do you entertain that?

647
00:33:10.833 --> 00:33:12.869
<i>But then he gets
to log off. go back to...</i>

648
00:33:13.735 --> 00:33:15.270
<i>Artificer. heaven or whatever.</i>

649
00:33:15.403 --> 00:33:19.307
<i>and laugh with his weird
extra-dimensional friends</i>

650
00:33:19.674 --> 00:33:21.576
<i>"Hey. I was just playing around</i>

651
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:23.045
<i>with that simulation
again today.</i>

652
00:33:23.311 --> 00:33:25.680
<i>And I keep dropping them hints.
but no one's picking it up."</i>

653
00:33:26.883 --> 00:33:28.350
<i>But it's interesting because.</i>

654
00:33:28.617 --> 00:33:30.719
for me. the villager speaks to.

655
00:33:30.853 --> 00:33:33.421
there are a few different
levels of what. you know

656
00:33:33.655 --> 00:33:35.024
being raised in
the Christian faith.

657
00:33:35.158 --> 00:33:36.259
I would call God.

658
00:33:36.926 --> 00:33:38.760
<i>There's the God
who made the world.</i>

659
00:33:38.928 --> 00:33:40.762
<i>and then there's the avatar</i>

660
00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:42.430
<i>who's descending in front
of you. and they're different</i>

661
00:33:42.564 --> 00:33:43.900
<i>because the God
who made the world</i>

662
00:33:44.033 --> 00:33:45.734
<i>is not the person
who's in front of you.</i>

663
00:33:45.868 --> 00:33:47.302
<i>We don't get to see that.
We don't get to see</i>

664
00:33:47.435 --> 00:33:48.905
<i>the creator of the game.</i>

665
00:33:49.337 --> 00:33:53.375
To extend this metaphor
to perhaps ridiculous lengths.

666
00:33:53.542 --> 00:33:56.012
You know. one minute.
a pixel on your screen

667
00:33:56.444 --> 00:33:58.313
will be representing a flower.

668
00:33:59.081 --> 00:34:00.216
And it is that flower.

669
00:34:00.817 --> 00:34:02.450
And then the next minute.
a villager will walk in.

670
00:34:02.584 --> 00:34:04.954
and that pixel represents him.

671
00:34:05.353 --> 00:34:06.588
<i>That pixel is part of him.</i>

672
00:34:06.755 --> 00:34:08.257
It doesn't take much
to think about like.

673
00:34:08.390 --> 00:34:10.325
"Well. if I just extrapolate
that to three dimensions.

674
00:34:11.194 --> 00:34:14.964
it's the same as atom
is in cells. You know. one year

675
00:34:15.397 --> 00:34:16.498
this cell's part of me.

676
00:34:16.631 --> 00:34:17.834
and then tomorrow
it'll flake off

677
00:34:17.967 --> 00:34:19.135
and it'll be part
of something else.

678
00:34:19.268 --> 00:34:20.468
And every seven years.

679
00:34:20.635 --> 00:34:22.671
our cells
replace themselves. anyway."

<i>Artist Chris Ware</i>

681
00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:27.475
<i>was so struck
by the implications</i>

682
00:34:27.609 --> 00:34:30.246
<i>of</i> Minecraft <i>that he created</i>

683

<i>Video game itself...</i>

685
00:34:36.052 --> 00:34:37.920
<i>catches this
sort of sense of...</i>

686
00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:40.555
<i>I don't know. more than
anything just like death.</i>

687

688
00:34:42.291 --> 00:34:44.593

689
00:34:44.726 --> 00:34:46.162

<i>closely approximates

692
00:34:52.534 --> 00:34:55.704
a disembodied consciousness
might experience. or something.

693
00:34:55.838 --> 00:34:57.639
I don't know how else
to really put it.

694
00:34:58.707 --> 00:35:01.010
<i>We build these peculiar
sculptures.</i>

695
00:35:01.143 --> 00:35:03.980
<i>She built giant... Well.
"giant" is a relative term</i>

696
00:35:04.113 --> 00:35:05.848
<i>when you're talking
digitally being reality.</i>

697
00:35:05.982 --> 00:35:08.818
<i>But giant sculptures
of myself and my wife</i>

698
00:35:09.218 --> 00:35:12.788
<i>amidst kind of
golden farmhouses</i>

699
00:35:12.922 --> 00:35:16.158
<i>that then would go underground.</i>

700
00:35:16.658 --> 00:35:18.794
<i>and train lines
or mine cart lines</i>

701
00:35:18.928 --> 00:35:22.131
<i>that would go underground
and connect between...</i>

702
00:35:24.432 --> 00:35:26.869
<i>the landscape
that kind of pre-existed.</i>

703
00:35:28.271 --> 00:35:31.941
But now she's 14. so she's
kind of passed beyond.

704
00:35:32.074 --> 00:35:34.576
But now she's in this
sort of baroque phase

705
00:35:34.709 --> 00:35:36.611
where she
and some of her friends

706
00:35:36.745 --> 00:35:38.546
now have gone back to <i>Minecraft</i>

707
00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:41.483
and are now looking at
their worlds that they made

708
00:35:41.683 --> 00:35:44.220
in their preadolescence
and kind of revisiting them.

709
00:35:44.353 --> 00:35:47.622
and listening to the music again
and getting all tearful.

710
00:35:47.756 --> 00:35:49.792
So it's a 14-year-old nostalgia

711
00:35:49.926 --> 00:35:52.128
for a lost world of innocence.
or something.

712
00:35:52.828 --> 00:35:56.698
I guess when she's 40
and I'm 85. or whatever

713
00:35:56.832 --> 00:36:01.203
and downloaded onto
a flash drive

714
00:36:01.337 --> 00:36:03.205
<i>we can continue to visit.</i>

715
00:36:18.254 --> 00:36:20.622
<i>My relationship
with the United States</i>

716
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:22.224
<i>has always been a very bad one.</i>

717
00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.162
<i>It has always seemed to me</i>

718
00:36:27.196 --> 00:36:30.399
<i>that I was about to be arrested
by the American police</i>

719
00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.002
<i>for some obscure reason.</i>

720
00:36:33.135 --> 00:36:36.038
<i>Perhaps that's because</i>
<i>of reading Kafka's</i> The Trial.

721
00:36:36.339 --> 00:36:38.707
<i>That book influenced me
very much.</i>

722
00:36:38.908 --> 00:36:41.710
<i>You know. where someone
is arrested for a crime.</i>

723
00:36:41.844 --> 00:36:44.546
<i>and he's never told
what crime he's committed.</i>

724
00:36:47.649 --> 00:36:51.153
When I was a kid. and one of
the things I really keyed into

725
00:36:51.921 --> 00:36:55.291
was adults at the time
would repeat things

726
00:36:55.825 --> 00:36:56.859
over and over again.

727
00:36:57.026 --> 00:36:58.361
For instance. <i>Newsweek</i> magazine.

728
00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.162
my dad used to get it
all the time.

729
00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:02.465
<i>And we'd be sitting around
the dinner table</i>

730
00:37:03.432 --> 00:37:05.434
<i>and he'd say.
"Well. you know..."</i>

731
00:37:05.567 --> 00:37:07.702
<i>and then he'd say word for word</i>

732
00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:11.941
<i>a sentence that was read</i>
<i>from the</i> Newsweek <i>magazine.</i>

733
00:37:14.609 --> 00:37:16.445
<i>So. it was like the magazine</i>

734
00:37:16.912 --> 00:37:19.048
<i>programmed him to say
that thing.</i>

735
00:37:19.181 --> 00:37:21.350
<i>This wasn't an original thought
that he had.</i>

736
00:37:22.051 --> 00:37:24.487
And that's really where
it started. I guess.

737
00:37:24.652 --> 00:37:29.425
You know. in my. like...
early childhood.

738
00:37:29.557 --> 00:37:34.763
the concept that the people
that I was dealing with were.

739
00:37:34.897 --> 00:37:38.067
I used the term
"chemical robots" at the time.

740
00:37:38.566 --> 00:37:42.471
but the concept that
they weren't actually conscious.

741
00:37:42.972 --> 00:37:44.807
<i>They had these
repeated behaviors</i>

742
00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:46.876
<i>that they would do
over and over again.</i>

743
00:37:50.745 --> 00:37:52.014
<i>In his paper.</i>

744
00:37:52.148 --> 00:37:53.715
<i>Nick Bostrom defined
a simulation</i>

745
00:37:53.849 --> 00:37:55.985
<i>of the entire mental history
of mankind</i>

746
00:37:56.118 --> 00:37:57.987
<i>as an "ancestor simulation"</i>

747
00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:01.857
<i>when estimating the amount of
computing power one might need.</i>

748
00:38:03.392 --> 00:38:05.895
<i>Does the idea
of ancestor simulations</i>

749
00:38:06.028 --> 00:38:08.064
<i>suggest that we are
retracing the steps</i>

750
00:38:08.197 --> 00:38:13.335
<i>of the genuine society
that created the simulation?</i>

751
00:38:14.036 --> 00:38:16.571
Well. that's one possibility.

752
00:38:16.704 --> 00:38:18.773
There could also be
all kinds of variations

753
00:38:19.707 --> 00:38:21.444
<i>ranging from
complete fantasy worlds</i>

754
00:38:21.576 --> 00:38:22.978
<i>that bear no resemblance</i>

755
00:38:23.179 --> 00:38:26.382
<i>to anything that existed
in physical reality</i>

756
00:38:26.549 --> 00:38:28.650
<i>to variations of history.</i>

757
00:38:30.585 --> 00:38:34.156
<i>All of that
is conceptually possible.</i>

758
00:38:35.091 --> 00:38:38.260
But an ancestor simulation
that I talk about in the paper

759
00:38:38.394 --> 00:38:41.197
which is to consider
the type of simulation

760
00:38:41.330 --> 00:38:44.699
where the simulators
would be creating

761
00:38:45.367 --> 00:38:48.070
<i>very detailed simulations
of people like</i>

762
00:38:48.437 --> 00:38:50.638
<i>their historical predecessors.</i>

763
00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:53.342
Maybe not exactly
the same people.

764
00:38:53.943 --> 00:38:55.578
but the same kind of people.

765
00:38:56.112 --> 00:38:59.849
Back when I was 9?
Nine or 10.

766
00:39:00.216 --> 00:39:02.585
I used to joke about
with my brothers and sister

767
00:39:03.018 --> 00:39:05.421
<i>that people would just go home.
and just like sit down</i>

768
00:39:05.554 --> 00:39:07.156
<i>and stare at walls
while no one was watching.</i>

769
00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:09.091
<i>You know. they would
just like...</i>

770
00:39:10.259 --> 00:39:12.561
<i>you know. go home
and T-pose. effectively.</i>

771
00:39:13.596 --> 00:39:15.531
<i>in their private spaces
when they weren't seen</i>

772
00:39:15.697 --> 00:39:16.664
<i>'cause they would just...</i>

773
00:39:17.533 --> 00:39:19.602
<i>deactivate their programming.
I guess.</i>

774
00:39:20.436 --> 00:39:22.938
I used to joke about that.
but that idea ran with me

775
00:39:23.072 --> 00:39:24.772
a lot when I was older.

776
00:39:26.609 --> 00:39:28.310
<i>It kind of became
a little horrifying</i>

777
00:39:28.776 --> 00:39:30.212
<i>that these people
I would talk to.</i>

778
00:39:30.546 --> 00:39:33.382
<i>since nobody was watching.
the program would stop working.</i>

779
00:39:44.026 --> 00:39:45.594
Does not assume that

780
00:39:46.462 --> 00:39:49.598
all the details of our world
would be simulated

781
00:39:50.399 --> 00:39:52.935
to perfect subatomic precision
all the time.

782
00:39:53.335 --> 00:39:55.171
And indeed.
that kind of simulation

783
00:39:55.304 --> 00:39:57.772
might well be
completely intractable.

784
00:39:58.407 --> 00:40:00.742
Obviously. it depends on
the kind of computer power

785
00:40:00.876 --> 00:40:02.144
<i>available in
the basement simulators.</i>

786
00:40:02.278 --> 00:40:04.413
If you have
infinitely fast computers. sure.

787
00:40:04.746 --> 00:40:06.182
<i>But. no. the idea rather</i>

788
00:40:06.315 --> 00:40:07.850
<i>is that you would
be able to create</i>

789
00:40:07.983 --> 00:40:11.420
<i>a simulation capturing
only enough that.</i>

790
00:40:12.588 --> 00:40:13.889
<i>to the simulated creatures.</i>

791
00:40:14.023 --> 00:40:15.424
<i>they couldn't tell
the difference.</i>

792
00:40:15.658 --> 00:40:18.627
<i>And that would involve
some pretty clever footwork</i>

793
00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:20.095
<i>on behalf of the simulators</i>

794
00:40:20.229 --> 00:40:21.964
<i>that they would be able.
for example.</i>

795
00:40:22.097 --> 00:40:23.999
<i>to leave more detail
in a particular part of reality</i>

796
00:40:24.133 --> 00:40:25.601
<i>when we are paying attention.</i>

797
00:40:25.968 --> 00:40:29.338
<i>But then not simulating all
of those details all the time.</i>

798
00:40:31.073 --> 00:40:35.444
I'm occupying maybe
20 square feet?

799
00:40:36.278 --> 00:40:38.847
And yet there's a whole
world that exists

800
00:40:39.048 --> 00:40:40.449
because I know about it.

801
00:40:40.916 --> 00:40:42.251
It is here in my brain.

802
00:40:43.018 --> 00:40:45.788
I worked with a company
for a little while

803
00:40:45.921 --> 00:40:51.060
that launched what is now
a very popular app

804
00:40:51.427 --> 00:40:54.563
that is
an interactive fiction app.

805
00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:56.632
You know. there's an element of.
"Well. it's just like writing

806
00:40:56.764 --> 00:41:00.035
a choose-your-own-adventure.
But what became swiftly...

807
00:41:02.037 --> 00:41:03.239
obvious to me...

808
00:41:05.374 --> 00:41:08.344
how simple some of our
own decision-making is.

809
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:10.079
from a coding perspective.

810
00:41:11.213 --> 00:41:13.549
<i>A popular recent Reddit AMA</i>

811
00:41:13.682 --> 00:41:14.917
<i>was with a user who wrote</i>

812
00:41:15.484 --> 00:41:18.320
<i>"I am a real life
non-player character."</i>

813
00:41:19.088 --> 00:41:21.724
And... all right.
we're all good.

814
00:41:21.991 --> 00:41:24.193
So. a NPC

815
00:41:24.326 --> 00:41:27.896
<i>is a non-player character
that you will normally see</i>

816
00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:29.198
<i>in a video game.</i>

817
00:41:29.764 --> 00:41:33.202
<i>They're usually the people</i>
<i>that</i> aren't controlled

818
00:41:33.435 --> 00:41:36.372
<i>by the player
of the video game.</i>

819
00:41:36.639 --> 00:41:40.442
<i>They are the characters
that were programmed in there.</i>

820
00:41:41.577 --> 00:41:44.179
It's kind of like talking
to a person in real life.

821
00:41:44.413 --> 00:41:48.217
but they only have a set amount
of things that they can say.

822
00:41:48.484 --> 00:41:51.754
Hey. buddy. got a dead cat
in there or what?

823
00:41:52.087 --> 00:41:53.555
And you only have
specific lines

824
00:41:53.689 --> 00:41:55.958
<i>that you can say back to it
in response.</i>

825
00:41:59.194 --> 00:42:01.363
I can only imagine
if I was really a gamer.

826
00:42:01.697 --> 00:42:03.766
how I would experience
social interaction.

827
00:42:03.932 --> 00:42:07.303
<i>But even as a non-game player.
I sometimes find myself</i>

828
00:42:07.469 --> 00:42:10.172
<i>you know. dealing with
non-player characters.</i>

829
00:42:10.773 --> 00:42:16.545
I work at a grocery store.
and I have a specific...

830
00:42:17.513 --> 00:42:19.481
<i>list of things
that I need to accomplish</i>

831
00:42:19.648 --> 00:42:23.018
<i>when greeting a customer
and checking out their items.</i>

832
00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:27.856
<i>And because of that.
it just made logical sense</i>

833
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:30.192
<i>that I create kind of
a mental script</i>

834
00:42:30.326 --> 00:42:31.960
<i>that I go through
with each customer.</i>

835
00:42:32.094 --> 00:42:33.262
<i>When this stimuli happens</i>

836
00:42:33.395 --> 00:42:35.397
<i>to him. generally speaking.</i>

837
00:42:35.597 --> 00:42:36.932
<i>he reacts in this way.</i>

838
00:42:37.099 --> 00:42:39.001
<i>It's not terribly
different from</i>

839
00:42:39.401 --> 00:42:41.570
<i>the code that tells
the chickens</i>

840
00:42:41.704 --> 00:42:42.971
<i>of</i> Minecraft <i>what to do</i>

841
00:42:43.105 --> 00:42:44.808
<i>or the turtles</i>
<i>in</i> Mario Brothers.

842
00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:47.710
<i>or the mosquitoes of me.</i>

843
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:49.211
<i>You know. they're all kind of</i>

844
00:42:49.345 --> 00:42:50.312
<i>operating on the same
principles.</i>

845
00:42:50.814 --> 00:42:52.948
<i>If this then that.
if not then don't.</i>

846
00:42:53.115 --> 00:42:54.750
It's not too much of a leap
to think that

847
00:42:55.017 --> 00:42:56.985
consciousness may mean...

848
00:42:58.788 --> 00:43:00.022
we are being inhabited

849
00:43:00.155 --> 00:43:03.092
by some sort of
player-type intelligence.

850
00:43:03.359 --> 00:43:05.527
The reason everyone loves
to be like.

851
00:43:05.661 --> 00:43:08.297
"Oh. small world."
is because it is. actually.

852
00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:10.199
There just isn't enough
processing power

853
00:43:10.332 --> 00:43:13.068
to render seven billion
consciousnesses.

854
00:43:13.736 --> 00:43:16.205
There are not seven billion
consciousnesses.

855
00:43:16.338 --> 00:43:18.006
Yeah. there might be
seven billion

856
00:43:18.173 --> 00:43:20.876
in the general algorithm
of how many people are on Earth.

857
00:43:21.043 --> 00:43:22.444
But when you start talking
to people.

858
00:43:22.611 --> 00:43:25.381
there's probably like
a couple hundred thousand AI's.

859
00:43:25.714 --> 00:43:30.886
that are serving as
the substream for the. you know.

860
00:43:31.387 --> 00:43:34.089
"people you know" experience
that everyone's having on Earth.

861
00:43:34.223 --> 00:43:36.759
So. when you find that
you know the same people.

862
00:43:36.892 --> 00:43:40.095
or six degrees of separation.
it's just not a surprise at all.

863
00:43:40.229 --> 00:43:42.231
In fact. it's a flaw
in the system.

864
00:43:42.431 --> 00:43:44.868
And that's just the limit of
the actual processing power

865
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.069
of the machine
that the sims running on.

866
00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:49.238
<i>Well. have you ever encountered</i>

867
00:43:49.772 --> 00:43:51.073
<i>a non-player characters?</i>

868
00:43:51.673 --> 00:43:53.342
<i>I mean.
you encounter them all the time</i>

869
00:43:53.475 --> 00:43:54.910
<i>when you're walking down
the street</i>

870
00:43:55.043 --> 00:43:56.378
<i>and you don't interact
with people.</i>

871
00:43:56.512 --> 00:43:58.380
<i>Like. it's just like
in a video game.</i>

872
00:43:58.547 --> 00:44:00.516
<i>It's just. there's much less
processing power</i>

873
00:44:00.649 --> 00:44:03.218
<i>being attributed
to the automatons.</i>

874
00:44:03.952 --> 00:44:05.287
<i>But once you start interacting.</i>

875
00:44:05.421 --> 00:44:07.523
<i>then something has to
actually serve</i>

876
00:44:07.656 --> 00:44:13.228
<i>as the intelligence behind
that so-called human.</i>

877
00:44:15.164 --> 00:44:17.733
Society is rapidly secularizing.

878
00:44:17.867 --> 00:44:20.536
You know. religion is
completely falling apart.

879
00:44:21.737 --> 00:44:24.473
And there's elements of that
that are wonderful.

880
00:44:24.973 --> 00:44:26.375
You know. I think religion plays

881
00:44:27.543 --> 00:44:30.847
an overly restrictive role
in people's lives too often.

882
00:44:31.848 --> 00:44:33.715
Certainly. the religion
I was raised in does.

883
00:44:34.016 --> 00:44:35.617
<i>But I do know people</i>

884
00:44:36.786 --> 00:44:38.187
<i>from my childhood</i>

885
00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:40.589
<i>in a fairly
Evangelical Christian world</i>

886
00:44:41.123 --> 00:44:44.993
<i>who. you know. wanted to...</i>

887
00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:47.029
<i>would've committed
violent acts.</i>

888
00:44:47.296 --> 00:44:50.299
if only God...

889
00:44:51.266 --> 00:44:53.168
<i>if only God
wouldn't punish them for it.</i>

890
00:44:53.368 --> 00:44:54.904
<i>Now. why it takes God
to do that.</i>

891
00:44:55.037 --> 00:44:56.940
<i>as opposed to one's own honor</i>

892
00:44:57.072 --> 00:44:59.174
<i>and self-worth and love
for thy neighbor. I don't know.</i>

893
00:44:59.308 --> 00:45:00.676
<i>But that was case for me.</i>

894
00:45:01.243 --> 00:45:02.511
<i>I believe that this thought.</i>

895
00:45:02.678 --> 00:45:04.279
<i>that we are living
in a simulation.</i>

896
00:45:04.446 --> 00:45:06.916
I think that is going
to just increase in popularity.

897
00:45:07.583 --> 00:45:10.752
And for people who are
content to see

898
00:45:10.887 --> 00:45:12.054
both sides of an argument

899
00:45:12.221 --> 00:45:13.989
and that doesn't
split our heads in two.

900
00:45:14.623 --> 00:45:17.426
you know. for people who are
content to see shades of grey.

901
00:45:17.593 --> 00:45:20.429
I think that's a fine...
it's a fine idea.

902
00:45:20.562 --> 00:45:23.131
Because we don't... you know.
it doesn't change anything

903
00:45:23.265 --> 00:45:24.766
about my daily life.
necessarily.

904
00:45:24.901 --> 00:45:28.136
And it shouldn't.
So I find the simulation okay.

905
00:45:28.537 --> 00:45:30.907
So. if I was created
by a creator God. okay.

906
00:45:31.039 --> 00:45:33.542
So. if I'm a random sparking
of cells. okay. fine.

907
00:45:33.675 --> 00:45:36.011
It doesn't change much about
how I am living day to day.

908
00:45:36.946 --> 00:45:40.148
But there's a lot of people
with very absolutist mindsets.

909
00:45:40.415 --> 00:45:44.486
and I think once you tell them.
"Hey. you're a simulation."

910
00:45:45.554 --> 00:45:47.689
<i>the nihilistic
side of humanity.</i>

911
00:45:47.824 --> 00:45:49.224
<i>their first reaction would be</i>

912
00:45:49.525 --> 00:45:50.994
<i>"Well. it doesn't matter what
they do to anyone else.</i>

913
00:45:51.693 --> 00:45:53.897
<i>because I know that I'm real.
and I feel it."</i>

914
00:45:54.029 --> 00:45:55.798
<i>But if there's no proof
that they're real.</i>

915
00:45:56.833 --> 00:45:59.201
<i>you know.
then what's the point of laws?</i>

916
00:45:59.334 --> 00:46:01.169
<i>What's the point of all this.
you know?</i>

917
00:46:05.507 --> 00:46:09.678
I do honestly think there is
a certain degree of...

918
00:46:11.246 --> 00:46:12.982
inability to separate
real world

919
00:46:13.115 --> 00:46:14.116
from digital realities

920
00:46:14.349 --> 00:46:15.852
<i>when you have something like</i>

921
00:46:16.084 --> 00:46:19.187
<i>the shooter in New Zealand
live-streaming what he's doing</i>

922
00:46:19.354 --> 00:46:22.391
<i>and going after people like
he's in a first-person shooter.</i>

923
00:46:22.558 --> 00:46:25.862
<i>And going after the people who
were like Muslims or. you know.</i>

924
00:46:25.995 --> 00:46:27.262
<i>people shoot up synagogues.</i>

925
00:46:27.729 --> 00:46:30.098
<i>Going after someone who is
constructed as an "other"</i>

926
00:46:30.232 --> 00:46:32.501
<i>by the media that they consume.</i>

927
00:46:33.803 --> 00:46:37.339
We must meet the threat
with our valor. our blood.

928
00:46:37.539 --> 00:46:39.408
indeed. with our very lives

929
00:46:39.775 --> 00:46:42.779
to ensure
that human civilization.

930
00:46:42.979 --> 00:46:44.146
not insect.

931
00:46:44.613 --> 00:46:48.483
<i>dominates this galaxy
now and always!</i>

932
00:46:49.117 --> 00:46:52.254
<i>However. you end up
sort of in that place</i>

933
00:46:52.721 --> 00:46:55.757
<i>where everyone you shoot at
just kind of disappears</i>

934
00:46:55.892 --> 00:46:57.492
<i>and they were all pod people.
you know.</i>

935
00:46:57.626 --> 00:46:59.494
<i>and they weren't real.
or the NPC meme.</i>

936
00:46:59.695 --> 00:47:02.431
<i>you get into a place where
you kind of treat reality</i>

937
00:47:02.664 --> 00:47:05.400
<i>like these are digital.
disposable bodies.</i>

938
00:47:17.245 --> 00:47:18.815
<i>And so one guy might plug in.</i>

939
00:47:18.948 --> 00:47:20.182
<i>he's Kanye West.</i>

940
00:47:20.549 --> 00:47:22.384
<i>One person might plug in.
instead of doing that.</i>

941
00:47:22.517 --> 00:47:25.554
<i>he's Michael Phelps.</i>

942
00:47:25.955 --> 00:47:29.524
They plug in and they play
and they stay at the top level

943
00:47:29.658 --> 00:47:32.527
in some way that they can.
doing different exploits.

944
00:47:33.261 --> 00:47:35.631
But then you have people
who log in.

945
00:47:35.764 --> 00:47:37.766
they used to play a lot
and they were really good.

946
00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:39.969
but then they unplugged
and didn't come back.

947
00:47:40.103 --> 00:47:42.237
Years and years since
they were plugged in our reality

948
00:47:42.371 --> 00:47:45.307
would be a celebrity
who was really good.

949
00:47:45.674 --> 00:47:47.776
and then just fell from grace
and never really came back.

950
00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:51.246
I can't name a specific
celebrity here.

951
00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:54.149
plus I don't want to throw
that into your film.

952
00:47:54.716 --> 00:47:58.253
Anyway. so they would
go totally like.

953
00:47:58.420 --> 00:47:59.755
they'd be going straight

954
00:47:59.922 --> 00:48:01.356
and all of a sudden
they'll be doing something

955
00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:02.591
that's totally perpendicular

956
00:48:02.724 --> 00:48:04.192
to their normal
behavior patterns.

957
00:48:04.559 --> 00:48:07.830
'Cause in a video game.
you're doing it well...

958
00:48:08.831 --> 00:48:10.399
then all of a sudden.
you just get bored

959
00:48:10.699 --> 00:48:12.902
and you start doing something
totally different.

960
00:48:13.036 --> 00:48:14.336
I've done that myself. you know.

961
00:48:14.469 --> 00:48:15.771
I'm playing <i>Grand Theft Auto</i>
and...

962
00:48:16.204 --> 00:48:18.941
you know. you have millions
and millions of dollars

963
00:48:19.075 --> 00:48:20.877
and all of a sudden it's like.
"Yeah. okay...

964
00:48:21.077 --> 00:48:22.979
<i>I think I'm gonna hole up
in this apartment building...</i>

965
00:48:23.112 --> 00:48:25.681
<i>and just see how many police
I can get to try to kill me."</i>

966
00:48:26.248 --> 00:48:29.584
<i>You know. then you kind of
just go for something crazy.</i>

967
00:48:36.025 --> 00:48:38.460
<i>I once said to my uncle...</i>

968
00:48:39.361 --> 00:48:41.196
<i>"What if this is all fake?</i>

969
00:48:41.396 --> 00:48:42.764
<i>You know. what if
none of this is real?"</i>

970
00:48:42.899 --> 00:48:44.801
<i>And he said. "Well. then what's
to keep me</i>

971
00:48:44.934 --> 00:48:47.769
<i>from going door to door just
shooting people in the head?"</i>

972
00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:51.373
<i>"Or what's to keep me from.
you know. shooting you?"</i>

973
00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:56.278
<i>And it always struck me as.
"Is that what you want to do?"</i>

974
00:48:56.745 --> 00:49:00.248
<i>"Is the only thing
keeping you from doing that</i>

975
00:49:00.783 --> 00:49:04.486
<i>the fact that the world is real
and there are consequences?"</i>

976
00:49:06.923 --> 00:49:09.058
Did you see that video
of the gentleman

977
00:49:09.192 --> 00:49:10.459
on the East Coast...

978
00:49:11.027 --> 00:49:12.028
West Coast. I'm sorry.

979
00:49:12.461 --> 00:49:14.496
who. he hijacked...

980
00:49:15.965 --> 00:49:18.667
a commercial air flight
that was empty?

981
00:49:19.135 --> 00:49:20.235
It was just him onboard.

982
00:49:20.635 --> 00:49:22.604
and he had no training
whatsoever.

983
00:49:23.572 --> 00:49:25.774
And he started just flying
around the coast.

984
00:49:29.011 --> 00:49:30.479
What the hell?

985
00:49:31.781 --> 00:49:34.217
Oh. my God.
What is happening right now?

986
00:49:34.382 --> 00:49:35.484
Did you ever see that?

987
00:49:48.865 --> 00:49:51.100
<i>He's flying and he's
talking about things.</i>

988
00:49:51.834 --> 00:49:53.169
<i>This is probably like</i>

989
00:49:53.301 --> 00:49:54.603
<i>jail time for life. huh?</i>

990
00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:57.372
<i>I would hope it is
for a guy like me.</i>

991
00:50:03.146 --> 00:50:05.014
<i>One of the things he's doing is</i>

992
00:50:05.815 --> 00:50:07.482
<i>he's kind of breaking
people's perceptions</i>

993
00:50:07.616 --> 00:50:11.419
<i>'cause he's doing stuff like.
he's doing loops and what not.</i>

994
00:50:11.854 --> 00:50:13.555
<i>He's getting remarkably close
to the ground.</i>

995
00:50:13.688 --> 00:50:15.690
<i>He's over the ocean.
over the land.</i>

996
00:50:16.192 --> 00:50:17.559
<i>He's doing tricks.</i>

997
00:50:20.797 --> 00:50:22.697
<i>Just flying the plane around.</i>

998
00:50:22.865 --> 00:50:24.499
<i>do you seem
comfortable with that?</i>

999
00:50:24.633 --> 00:50:26.035
<i>Oh. hell yeah. It's a blast.</i>

1000
00:50:26.202 --> 00:50:28.403
<i>I've played video games
before. so...</i>

1001
00:50:28.637 --> 00:50:31.506
<i>I... I know what I'm doing
a little bit.</i>

1002
00:50:36.913 --> 00:50:40.348
And this is shortly before
he crashes purposefully

1003
00:50:40.515 --> 00:50:43.618
into a. I believe an island.

1004
00:50:45.087 --> 00:50:46.454
Just offshore.

1005
00:50:47.756 --> 00:50:50.525
But yeah. it's nuts.
that one of his last thoughts

1006
00:50:50.659 --> 00:50:53.796
is how much it's like
a video game to him.

1007
00:50:54.864 --> 00:50:55.764
Then he crashes.

1008
00:51:03.705 --> 00:51:07.310
<i>But yeah. there is a dark side.</i>

1009
00:51:07.442 --> 00:51:08.677
<i>There's people out there</i>

1010
00:51:08.811 --> 00:51:10.478
<i>who are gonna be
chaotic about it.</i>

1011
00:51:26.128 --> 00:51:27.897
...very pronounced
impression

1012
00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:32.534
would probably occur to us.
to many of us. again and again

1013
00:51:32.734 --> 00:51:34.904
and always without explanation.

1014
00:51:35.171 --> 00:51:40.243
The acute. absolute sensation
that we had done once before

1015
00:51:40.709 --> 00:51:42.711
<i>what we were
just about to do now.</i>

1016
00:51:42.912 --> 00:51:45.413
<i>We would have
the overwhelming impression</i>

1017
00:51:46.082 --> 00:51:50.119
<i>that we were reliving
the present. Déjà vu.</i>

1018
00:51:52.255 --> 00:51:53.155
Déjà vu.

1019
00:51:56.025 --> 00:51:58.560
- Switch. Apoc.
- What is it?

1020
00:51:58.727 --> 00:52:00.562
A déjà vu is usually
a glitch in the matrix.

1021
00:52:00.863 --> 00:52:02.365
It happens when
they change something.

1022
00:52:02.899 --> 00:52:05.301
What we need at this point
is to locate.

1023
00:52:05.433 --> 00:52:06.701
to bring forth as evidence

1024
00:52:07.036 --> 00:52:09.305
someone who has managed
somehow.

1025
00:52:09.571 --> 00:52:10.940
it doesn't matter how.

1026
00:52:11.539 --> 00:52:13.876
to retain memories
of a different present.

1027
00:52:14.176 --> 00:52:16.478
Latent. alternate
world impressions.

1028
00:52:16.611 --> 00:52:18.580
different in some
significant way from this.

1029
00:52:18.915 --> 00:52:20.415
<i>Philip K. Dick might have been</i>

1030
00:52:20.548 --> 00:52:21.817
<i>surprised to learn</i>

1031
00:52:22.051 --> 00:52:23.853
<i>how common memories
of a different present</i>

1032
00:52:23.986 --> 00:52:26.355
<i>would become
in the 21st Century.</i>

1033
00:52:26.721 --> 00:52:28.858
If you remember a Kit-Kat
looking like this...

1034
00:52:29.191 --> 00:52:31.861
then you could be living
in an alternate reality.

1035
00:52:32.594 --> 00:52:34.496
Welcome to
"Conspiracy Chat N'That."

1036
00:52:34.729 --> 00:52:36.399
Today's topic is the
mind-warping.

1037
00:52:36.531 --> 00:52:38.334
reality-bending Mandela Effect.

1038
00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:39.902
It's called the Mandela Effect

1039
00:52:40.036 --> 00:52:42.038
because hundreds and hundreds
of thousands of people

1040
00:52:42.171 --> 00:52:45.674
<i>remember Nelson Mandela
dying in prison.</i>

1041
00:52:45.808 --> 00:52:47.343
and that actually
never happened.

1042
00:52:47.475 --> 00:52:49.278
But hundreds and hundreds
of thousands of people are like

1043
00:52:49.412 --> 00:52:51.347
"No. I remember Nelson Mandela
dying in prison."

1044
00:52:51.513 --> 00:52:52.747
But like that never happened.

1045
00:52:53.049 --> 00:52:54.616
<i>So. when reports</i>

1046
00:52:54.884 --> 00:52:55.750
<i>of the former South African
president's death</i>

1047
00:52:55.885 --> 00:52:57.186
<i>became news in 2013.</i>

1048
00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:58.720
<i>it re-sparked
the previous debate</i>

1049
00:52:58.854 --> 00:52:59.822
of whether or not
we've somehow slid

1050
00:52:59.956 --> 00:53:01.656
into an alternate timeline.

1051
00:53:01.791 --> 00:53:03.960
<i>The Berenstein Bears
children books have changed.</i>

1052
00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:05.995
<i>They used to be called
"Berenstein Bears."</i>

1053
00:53:06.128 --> 00:53:07.629
<i>and now they've always
been known as</i>

1054
00:53:07.762 --> 00:53:08.798
<i>"The Berenstain Bears".</i>

1055
00:53:09.165 --> 00:53:11.834
<i>Over 10 thousand
Mandela effects</i>

1056
00:53:11.968 --> 00:53:14.403
<i>have been logged and confirmed.</i>

1057
00:53:14.602 --> 00:53:15.704
<i>If you go back</i>

1058
00:53:15.838 --> 00:53:17.639
and literally find
like a VHS tape

1059
00:53:17.772 --> 00:53:20.508
of like Snow White from 1998

1060
00:53:20.642 --> 00:53:22.211
<i>and you put it in a VHS player.</i>

1061
00:53:22.345 --> 00:53:25.047
they say.
"Magic mirror on the wall".

1062
00:53:25.381 --> 00:53:30.353
Tell me! Tell me. bitch. that
you do not fucking remember

1063
00:53:30.485 --> 00:53:31.887
"Mirror. mirror on the wall."

1064
00:53:32.021 --> 00:53:33.789
Well. that doesn't exist.
Mandela Effect?

1065
00:53:33.923 --> 00:53:36.058
Alternate reality?
I think yes!

1066
00:53:51.807 --> 00:53:53.742
<i>When I was young.
I lived in Mexico.</i>

1067
00:53:54.776 --> 00:53:56.212
<i>Very young. like 10 years old.</i>

1068
00:53:56.345 --> 00:53:57.679
<i>And then I returned there</i>

1069
00:53:58.114 --> 00:54:00.883
for the summer
with my mother once.

1070
00:54:01.716 --> 00:54:03.219
<i>I was 18 years old.</i>

1071
00:54:03.386 --> 00:54:04.987
<i>and I really didn't
know anybody.</i>

1072
00:54:05.254 --> 00:54:07.423
<i>I finally get a call
from some friends.</i>

1073
00:54:07.857 --> 00:54:09.125
<i>friends of friends.</i>

1074
00:54:09.258 --> 00:54:10.493
<i>These guys pick me up.</i>

1075
00:54:10.658 --> 00:54:14.130
<i>and they're in
a 1970 Jeep Wagoneer.</i>

1076
00:54:14.964 --> 00:54:16.432
<i>Big old machine.</i>

1077
00:54:16.765 --> 00:54:19.235
<i>It immediately becomes clear
that they have been drinking</i>

1078
00:54:19.368 --> 00:54:22.737
<i>because they say. "Hey.
help yourself to a beer."</i>

1079
00:54:22.905 --> 00:54:24.373
<i>And I look in the back
of the Wagoneer.</i>

1080
00:54:24.507 --> 00:54:26.208
<i>and there's all
these empties rolling around</i>

1081
00:54:26.342 --> 00:54:28.743
<i>and couldn't find a seat belt.
and I just said.</i>

1082
00:54:28.878 --> 00:54:30.346
<i>"All right. fuck it."
I opened a beer.</i>

1083
00:54:30.946 --> 00:54:33.249
Then. we were driving
down a major street

1084
00:54:33.382 --> 00:54:34.784
in a city called Cuernavaca.

1085
00:54:35.184 --> 00:54:37.920
<i>It had a cement divider
between the two sides...</i>

1086
00:54:38.054 --> 00:54:39.989
<i>...and the driver</i>

1087
00:54:40.456 --> 00:54:44.626
<i>for shits and giggles
decided to pop...</i>

1088
00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:47.729
<i>in an opening.
pop onto the wrong direction</i>

1089
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:50.598
<i>and drive until
there was another opening.</i>

1090
00:54:51.067 --> 00:54:53.035
<i>So we were driving
against traffic</i>

1091
00:54:53.269 --> 00:54:54.602
<i>in the wrong side</i>

1092
00:54:55.371 --> 00:54:59.075
<i>and no cars came. you know.
we didn't get in an accident.</i>

1093
00:54:59.208 --> 00:55:02.644
<i>So that was the first near miss
but I don't count that.</i>

1094
00:55:02.878 --> 00:55:04.146
<i>And so we headed off.</i>

1095
00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:05.915
<i>They...
We went to a liquor store.</i>

1096
00:55:06.048 --> 00:55:08.284
<i>They bought some more liquor.</i>

1097
00:55:09.218 --> 00:55:12.254
<i>They said. "What should we do?
Let's go to the pyramids."</i>

1098
00:55:12.388 --> 00:55:16.325
<i>So there was a pyramid in town.
and so we head over...</i>

1099
00:55:16.459 --> 00:55:19.161
<i>we climb a fence. we're
walking on a Mexican pyramid.</i>

1100
00:55:19.761 --> 00:55:21.564
<i>It's. you know. it's...</i>

1101
00:55:22.565 --> 00:55:24.934
<i>kind of an awesome experience
in and of itself.</i>

1102
00:55:26.634 --> 00:55:28.104
<i>And they're getting bored.</i>

1103
00:55:28.237 --> 00:55:31.073
<i>They say. "All right.
that's it. Let's go home."</i>

1104
00:55:32.674 --> 00:55:34.276
<i>And we get back in
the Wagoneer. and in Mexico</i>

1105
00:55:34.410 --> 00:55:35.978
<i>at that time of year.
this was summer.</i>

1106
00:55:36.112 --> 00:55:39.048
<i>they have monsoons
that last five minutes.</i>

1107
00:55:39.714 --> 00:55:43.751
<i>Now the road's completely wet.
and these guys are drunk</i>

1108
00:55:43.886 --> 00:55:46.188
<i>and I'm sitting
in the back seat.</i>

1109
00:55:47.456 --> 00:55:50.359
<i>The driver says
to the passenger.</i>

1110
00:55:50.493 --> 00:55:54.662
<i>"Hey. man. why don't you take
the wheel for a sec?"</i>

1111
00:55:55.197 --> 00:55:56.999
<i>And I'm sitting in the back
and I'm like...</i>

1112
00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:59.335
<i>"That's the worst idea
I've ever heard!"</i>

1113
00:55:59.468 --> 00:56:02.071
<i>But it's too late. right?
It's too late.</i>

1114
00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:05.574
<i>And he grabs the wheel...</i>

1115
00:56:05.707 --> 00:56:08.944
<i>...and the car hits the side
of the road right away.</i>

1116
00:56:09.211 --> 00:56:11.480
<i>but hits the curve and slides...</i>

1117
00:56:11.914 --> 00:56:13.149
<i>So it hits one side
of the street</i>

1118
00:56:13.282 --> 00:56:15.251
<i>and slides in
the other direction.</i>

1119
00:56:15.417 --> 00:56:17.987
<i>hits another curb
and flies through the air...</i>

1120
00:56:19.555 --> 00:56:22.958
<i>...probably about
a thousand feet through the air</i>

1121
00:56:23.092 --> 00:56:25.127
<i>and lands on the roof.</i>

1122
00:56:30.166 --> 00:56:34.036
<i>All the windows shattered.
and I broke ribs...</i>

1123
00:56:34.336 --> 00:56:37.506
<i>'cause I took the impact
of the roof.</i>

1124
00:56:38.174 --> 00:56:40.876
<i>And gasoline
started pouring out of the car.</i>

1125
00:56:41.010 --> 00:56:42.744
<i>and I got the wind
knocked out of me.</i>

1126
00:56:42.912 --> 00:56:48.716
<i>I crawled out of the window
and got as far away as I could.</i>

1127
00:56:48.851 --> 00:56:51.954
<i>and then a truck pulls up.</i>

1128
00:56:54.156 --> 00:56:57.226
<i>And they say.
"Oh. great. Banditos."</i>

1129
00:56:58.861 --> 00:57:01.830
<i>And then another car pulls up.
and it's the Federales.</i>

1130
00:57:02.097 --> 00:57:03.698
<i>the Mexican police.</i>

1131
00:57:03.899 --> 00:57:05.467
<i>You know. the</i> banditos
<i>just leave.</i>

1132
00:57:05.601 --> 00:57:07.203
<i>And I'm like. "Oh. great.
the police are here."</i>

1133
00:57:07.369 --> 00:57:09.071
<i>And they're like.
"No. actually. it's worse.</i>

1134
00:57:09.205 --> 00:57:10.539
<i>It's worse that they're here."</i>

1135
00:57:11.073 --> 00:57:13.842
<i>"Once they learn
that we've been drinking.</i>

1136
00:57:13.976 --> 00:57:15.511
<i>they're gonna arrest us all.</i>

1137
00:57:15.678 --> 00:57:18.480
<i>and then they're gonna ask
for a big bribe for you.</i>

1138
00:57:18.614 --> 00:57:19.782
<i>because you're American."</i>

1139
00:57:20.816 --> 00:57:22.551
<i>So I was standing
in the darkness.</i>

1140
00:57:22.952 --> 00:57:25.187
<i>and then another car pulls up.</i>

1141
00:57:25.688 --> 00:57:28.190
<i>A guy gets out. and he says...</i>

1142
00:57:29.291 --> 00:57:32.161
<i>"Excuse me.
I am the chief accountant</i>

1143
00:57:32.361 --> 00:57:34.630
<i>of the Cuernavaca
Police Department".</i>

1144
00:57:34.897 --> 00:57:36.632
<i>so the local city police.</i>

1145
00:57:37.633 --> 00:57:40.836
<i>And he knows about the
corruption of the Federales.</i>

1146
00:57:41.303 --> 00:57:47.109
<i>And my hosts managed
to get the information to him</i>

1147
00:57:47.243 --> 00:57:50.913
<i>that they had hidden
an American in the darkness.</i>

1148
00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:54.316
<i>And they got me out of there.</i>

1149
00:57:54.984 --> 00:57:57.586
<i>But the whole thing.
it seemed so...</i>

1150
00:57:57.886 --> 00:58:01.890
<i>so implausible
that I had survived.</i>

1151
00:58:02.291 --> 00:58:05.995
<i>The likelihood of all of that
was just so low.</i>

1152
00:58:06.562 --> 00:58:09.265
<i>Somebody's gotta be
putting their hand on the scale</i>

1153
00:58:09.431 --> 00:58:11.367
<i>'cause I kinda just
looked at it in terms of</i>

1154
00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:14.536
<i>the algorithm tweaking
probabilities.</i>

1155
00:58:14.769 --> 00:58:18.073
<i>so that things are essentially
more interesting</i>

1156
00:58:18.941 --> 00:58:20.342
<i>'cause it's a game.</i>

1157
00:58:24.513 --> 00:58:27.983
Okay. so I think the first
like "public" place where

1158
00:58:28.117 --> 00:58:31.353
I actually was able
to put a name to an idea.

1159
00:58:31.987 --> 00:58:34.990
probably the <i>Matrix</i> movies.
you know?

1160
00:58:36.625 --> 00:58:40.763
<i>You can't mention simulation
without mentioning that.</i>

1161
00:58:41.764 --> 00:58:44.600
<i>The book he keeps
all of his stuff in is...</i>

1162
00:58:45.301 --> 00:58:47.436
<i>what is it called.</i>
Simulation & Simulacra?

1163
00:58:49.071 --> 00:58:50.406
<i>It's right there.
beginning of the movie.</i>

1164
00:58:50.539 --> 00:58:52.174
<i>just throws it
right in your face.</i>

1165
00:58:52.541 --> 00:58:56.178
<i>After the trilogy was over.
they released that animation</i>

1166
00:58:56.812 --> 00:58:57.980
The Animatrix.

1167
00:58:58.247 --> 00:59:00.949
Yeah. I think that one
really hit it home.

1168
00:59:01.083 --> 00:59:02.217
Like. the idea was planted

1169
00:59:02.351 --> 00:59:04.553
and that thing really
pressed on it.

1170
00:59:05.287 --> 00:59:08.824
<i>In</i> Renaissance. Part I
and II. <i>it's kinda hosted by</i>

1171
00:59:09.091 --> 00:59:10.993
<i>almost like this
technology demigod.</i>

1172
00:59:11.694 --> 00:59:13.562
<i>Just kind of bringing you
in and out of reality.</i>

1173
00:59:13.962 --> 00:59:16.865
<i>You know. as far as like what's
going on inside the Matrix.</i>

1174
00:59:16.999 --> 00:59:18.500
<i>what's going on outside
the Matrix.</i>

1175
00:59:18.634 --> 00:59:21.503
<i>the history of
how the simulation was built.</i>

1176
00:59:25.774 --> 00:59:27.209
<i>I moved to Canada.</i>

1177
00:59:27.343 --> 00:59:28.744
<i>I lived in Canada
for a couple of months.</i>

1178
00:59:28.977 --> 00:59:34.950
<i>And so my friend from Illinois
drives up to Canada.</i>

1179
00:59:35.217 --> 00:59:36.485
we're hanging out.

1180
00:59:36.618 --> 00:59:38.253
"What do you want to see?"
"I don't know.

1181
00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:40.856
Let's go and see this dumb
Keanu Reeves action film."

1182
00:59:42.991 --> 00:59:44.828
<i>So we go and see this movie</i>

1183
00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:46.495
<i>and it's pretty good.
pretty good. pretty good.</i>

1184
00:59:46.628 --> 00:59:48.497
<i>And then he gets out
of the tank.</i>

1185
00:59:49.965 --> 00:59:51.533
<i>and we're like. "Whoa!"</i>

1186
00:59:57.940 --> 00:59:59.174
<i>Joshua Cooke</i>

1187
00:59:59.308 --> 01:00:00.844
<i>was a Virginia
high school student</i>

1188
01:00:00.976 --> 01:00:02.411
<i>when he heard about the film.</i>

1189
01:00:04.913 --> 01:00:06.982
<i>So. I was riding in a car</i>

1190
01:00:07.282 --> 01:00:10.319
<i>on the way home.
and a friend of mine</i>

1191
01:00:10.519 --> 01:00:12.254
- <i>was in the car.</i>
- Get in.

1192
01:00:12.488 --> 01:00:14.256
<i>She mentioned this movie</i>

1193
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:16.658
Matrix <i>that people</i>
<i>were going crazy over.</i>

1194
01:00:16.793 --> 01:00:18.394
<i>People were going
to the movie theaters</i>

1195
01:00:18.527 --> 01:00:20.262
<i>15 times in a row to see it.</i>

1196
01:00:20.896 --> 01:00:23.565
<i>And that people were getting
obsessed about it.</i>

1197
01:00:23.699 --> 01:00:24.700
<i>raving about it.</i>

1198
01:00:24.834 --> 01:00:26.268
<i>"Oh. man. you gotta see it!</i>

1199
01:00:26.568 --> 01:00:28.070
<i>You've never seen anything
like it. And the graphics.</i>

1200
01:00:28.203 --> 01:00:29.204
<i>Oh yeah!"</i>

1201
01:00:29.638 --> 01:00:31.173
<i>And then I heard him
say something</i>

1202
01:00:31.306 --> 01:00:32.741
<i>about a black trench coat
and stuff.</i>

1203
01:00:32.876 --> 01:00:35.611
<i>And that really hit me
for a few reasons.</i>

1204
01:00:35.845 --> 01:00:38.213
<i>One is. I had already had
a fascination.</i>

1205
01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:40.282
<i>an obsession really.
with the black trench coat</i>

1206
01:00:40.649 --> 01:00:42.985
<i>because of the movie</i>
The Crow.

1207
01:00:43.452 --> 01:00:45.721
<i>which was my first
movie obsession.</i>

1208
01:00:45.889 --> 01:00:48.323
<i>So I went to the
Blockbuster Video store.</i>

1209
01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:52.194
<i>And. from the very beginning
of the movie.</i>

1210
01:00:53.095 --> 01:00:54.363
<i>it had my attention.</i>

1211
01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:58.567
<i>And it had kind of like
a rough. aggressive.</i>

1212
01:00:59.268 --> 01:01:00.870
<i>you know. Rob Zombie.</i>

1213
01:01:01.003 --> 01:01:02.872
<i>heavy metal theme to it.</i>

1214
01:01:03.005 --> 01:01:04.173
The Matrix.

1215
01:01:04.373 --> 01:01:05.574
<i>The soundtrack
that makes you go...</i>

1216
01:01:05.741 --> 01:01:06.910
<i>Whoa.</i>

1217
01:01:07.042 --> 01:01:08.043
See. I thought about
the structure

1218
01:01:08.177 --> 01:01:09.378
of the whole thing.

1219
01:01:09.511 --> 01:01:11.146
like. what would it be
structurally?

1220
01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:13.982
And an idea came to my mind
of what it would look like.

1221
01:01:15.751 --> 01:01:18.855
<i>I don't think it's just people
in pods somewhere else.</i>

1222
01:01:18.987 --> 01:01:21.623
<i>I think it's something
completely different than that.</i>

1223
01:01:22.524 --> 01:01:24.760
<i>I don't know. When I think
about it. I think of like</i>

1224
01:01:24.928 --> 01:01:28.096
<i>a giant white. brilliant white
marble hallway. right?</i>

1225
01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:29.899
<i>And then there's like a
pedestal in the center.</i>

1226
01:01:30.032 --> 01:01:32.401
<i>and this giant black sphere.</i>

1227
01:01:32.936 --> 01:01:36.371
<i>And that black sphere. to
these people in this reality.</i>

1228
01:01:37.272 --> 01:01:39.675
<i>that's effectively a computer.
you know?</i>

1229
01:01:40.409 --> 01:01:42.110
<i>No. and that
computer's running...</i>

1230
01:01:42.377 --> 01:01:44.179
<i>There could be
a little art museum card</i>

1231
01:01:44.313 --> 01:01:46.682
<i>next to it that says
"Universe... whatever".</i>

1232
01:01:47.316 --> 01:01:50.185
<i>And they just see what happens
out of that black mass</i>

1233
01:01:50.652 --> 01:01:53.823
<i>of stars and clouds. and deep.
deep. deep down.</i>

1234
01:01:54.356 --> 01:01:55.624
<i>people. like us.</i>

1235
01:01:57.426 --> 01:01:58.760
And then you go on
from that model.

1236
01:01:58.895 --> 01:02:02.097
you wonder. "Okay
is it important to them?"

1237
01:02:02.397 --> 01:02:04.333
<i>"Are we a very special case</i>

1238
01:02:04.466 --> 01:02:07.436
that the entire reality
is focused on?"

1239
01:02:07.703 --> 01:02:08.905
<i>'Cause they're trying
to figure out</i>

1240
01:02:09.037 --> 01:02:10.339
<i>what the point of life is.</i>

1241
01:02:10.606 --> 01:02:12.307
<i>and so they just keep
rerunning the universe.</i>

1242
01:02:14.476 --> 01:02:18.447
I think what they want us
to do is improve upon

1243
01:02:19.414 --> 01:02:21.583
the simulation that
they've already made.

1244
01:02:22.184 --> 01:02:25.320
And this was where
we get into GANS.

1245
01:02:26.154 --> 01:02:29.291
I don't know if that's how you
pronounce it. but G-A-N-S.

1246
01:02:30.827 --> 01:02:33.930
Generative Adversarial Networks.

1247
01:02:34.596 --> 01:02:37.332
<i>Basically. the idea is
that you have two AIs...</i>

1248
01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:39.936
<i>and they're competing
with each other.</i>

1249
01:02:40.469 --> 01:02:42.371
<i>AI number one is the Forger.</i>

1250
01:02:43.071 --> 01:02:46.675
<i>It wants to make pictures
of human beings...</i>

1251
01:02:47.276 --> 01:02:51.346
<i>that look like human beings.
enough to fool someone.</i>

1252
01:02:51.747 --> 01:02:54.182
<i>And then you have another one
that's the Inspector.</i>

1253
01:02:54.449 --> 01:02:56.285
<i>The Inspector's job
is to tell the difference</i>

1254
01:02:56.418 --> 01:02:58.186
<i>between fake pictures
of people</i>

1255
01:02:58.320 --> 01:02:59.856
<i>and actual pictures of people.</i>

1256
01:03:00.355 --> 01:03:02.658
<i>And the two of them just run
at each other.</i>

1257
01:03:02.792 --> 01:03:04.027
<i>boom. boom. boom...
Trying to fail.</i>

1258
01:03:04.159 --> 01:03:05.795
<i>trying to win. all that...</i>

1259
01:03:06.061 --> 01:03:09.231
<i>until. eventually. you and I
look at the pictures.</i>

1260
01:03:09.598 --> 01:03:11.000
<i>and they look real to us</i>

1261
01:03:11.633 --> 01:03:14.269
<i>because they've gone through
all these iterations.</i>

1262
01:03:17.539 --> 01:03:21.677
<i>But what are people if not...</i>

1263
01:03:22.411 --> 01:03:24.246
<i>generative
adversarial networks?</i>

1264
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:30.252
<i>Cop tries to solve crime.</i>

1265
01:03:30.452 --> 01:03:32.287
<i>Criminal tries to beat cop.</i>

1266
01:03:32.956 --> 01:03:34.356
I'm gonna kill you.

1267
01:03:35.223 --> 01:03:38.560
You idiot! You made me!

1268
01:03:42.264 --> 01:03:44.067
<i>Hacker tries to hack a system.</i>

1269
01:03:44.333 --> 01:03:46.301
<i>A programmer tries
to fix the system.</i>

1270
01:03:46.702 --> 01:03:50.405
<i>Audience gets jaded
with this type of media.</i>

1271
01:03:50.539 --> 01:03:51.908
<i>So somebody new comes along</i>

1272
01:03:52.041 --> 01:03:53.642
<i>and tries to make
something better.</i>

1273
01:03:53.943 --> 01:03:56.411
<i>We are constantly getting back
and forth at each other.</i>

1274
01:03:56.545 --> 01:03:57.746
<i>If you look at social media.</i>

1275
01:03:57.914 --> 01:03:59.782
<i>maybe this is why we're
always arguing</i>

1276
01:03:59.916 --> 01:04:05.088
<i>because we exist specifically
to refine and hone things.</i>

1277
01:04:05.788 --> 01:04:09.959
<i>In the end.
what do we want to create</i>

1278
01:04:10.192 --> 01:04:12.294
<i>if not another simulation?</i>

1279
01:04:17.366 --> 01:04:18.700
<i>Yeah. I mean.</i>

1280
01:04:19.035 --> 01:04:20.535
<i>there were a few lines in there
that were pretty deep.</i>

1281
01:04:21.637 --> 01:04:24.040
<i>Neo asked Morpheus.
"Why do my eyes hurt?"</i>

1282
01:04:24.874 --> 01:04:28.243
<i>And Morpheus looks at Neo
and says...</i>

1283
01:04:28.410 --> 01:04:30.278
<i>"Because you've never
used them before."</i>

1284
01:04:31.014 --> 01:04:32.915
<i>Well. I felt the same way.
And I felt like.</i>

1285
01:04:33.082 --> 01:04:34.917
<i>"Man. there's gotta be
more than this."</i>

1286
01:04:35.350 --> 01:04:36.752
<i>Okay. "You've never used</i>

1287
01:04:36.886 --> 01:04:39.454
your eyes before"
when he gets out of the Matrix

1288
01:04:39.588 --> 01:04:41.556
and everything's blurry.

1289
01:04:41.723 --> 01:04:44.593
that's very. very similar
to sort of what happens

1290
01:04:44.726 --> 01:04:48.363
in <i>Plato's Cave.</i> when he goes...

1291
01:04:48.764 --> 01:04:50.432
<i>When you're taken
outside the cave.</i>

1292
01:04:50.565 --> 01:04:52.601
<i>it takes a while
for your eyes to adjust</i>

1293
01:04:52.835 --> 01:04:54.569
<i>to what you're seeing
outside the cave.</i>

1294
01:04:54.871 --> 01:04:57.305
<i>And then. when he comes back
inside the cave</i>

1295
01:04:57.472 --> 01:04:59.641
<i>he can't see either</i>

1296
01:04:59.775 --> 01:05:02.045
<i>because he's used to seeing
things as they really are.</i>

1297
01:05:02.177 --> 01:05:03.745
<i>And so. you know. it says.</i>

1298
01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:05.547
<i>"Oh. and your friends
are sort of watching</i>

1299
01:05:05.681 --> 01:05:08.583
<i>on the projection screen.
things.</i>

1300
01:05:08.717 --> 01:05:11.888
<i>And they give themselves awards
for being the fastest</i>

1301
01:05:12.021 --> 01:05:13.990
<i>and best at spotting
what's going on.</i>

1302
01:05:14.123 --> 01:05:16.625
<i>And you just aren't
interested in this anymore</i>

1303
01:05:16.758 --> 01:05:18.427
<i>because you've seen
so much more."</i>

1304
01:05:18.928 --> 01:05:21.530
It's funny how this
just sort of like

1305
01:05:22.031 --> 01:05:25.902
value system
that allows us to believe

1306
01:05:26.035 --> 01:05:29.072
that we know something
that everyone else doesn't.

1307
01:05:29.471 --> 01:05:31.306
Like also contributes
to that othering.

1308
01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:32.708
<i>when he's walking
down the street</i>

1309
01:05:32.842 --> 01:05:34.509
<i>and everyone is fake.
you know?</i>

1310
01:05:34.643 --> 01:05:36.145
<i>And then. yeah.
the person in the red dress.</i>

1311
01:05:36.278 --> 01:05:39.381
<i>and later the guy's like.
"Oh. I engineered her."</i>

1312
01:05:40.449 --> 01:05:42.217
Yeah. that seems like...

1313
01:05:42.350 --> 01:05:44.854
that is such
a school shooter fantasy.

1314
01:05:47.890 --> 01:05:51.359
<i>You have these unique eyes to
see what no one else can see.</i>

1315
01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:53.729
<i>and everyone else
is just like...</i>

1316
01:05:54.529 --> 01:05:57.200
<i>they're just asleep.</i>

1317
01:05:57.365 --> 01:06:01.303
Sleep. Sleep.

1318
01:06:02.471 --> 01:06:04.040
<i>Having told you my story</i>

1319
01:06:04.173 --> 01:06:07.944
<i>about when I was a kid.
when he got out of the tank...</i>

1320
01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:14.249
<i>the immediate thing that
flashed in my mind was. "Okay.</i>

1321
01:06:14.817 --> 01:06:18.253
<i>this is kind of like what
happened to me at that point.</i>

1322
01:06:18.788 --> 01:06:20.355
<i>but there was no tank
to get out of."</i>

1323
01:06:21.023 --> 01:06:24.961
<i>And I maybe didn't even
have a body. per se.</i>

1324
01:06:28.931 --> 01:06:30.499
<i>I went to a store</i>

1325
01:06:30.732 --> 01:06:32.667
<i>in the mall near my house.
it's called Hot Topic.</i>

1326
01:06:32.802 --> 01:06:34.302
<i>I don't know
if you've ever heard of it.</i>

1327
01:06:34.837 --> 01:06:37.305
<i>And they had all kind of
goth wear.</i>

1328
01:06:37.439 --> 01:06:39.142
<i>black clothes.
black everything.</i>

1329
01:06:39.775 --> 01:06:44.013
<i>There was a line of
trench coats hanging on a rack</i>

1330
01:06:44.279 --> 01:06:45.547
<i>in the corner of the store.</i>

1331
01:06:45.714 --> 01:06:47.549
<i>And I was with my sister.
Tiffany.</i>

1332
01:06:47.784 --> 01:06:51.788
<i>And I made a beeline straight
for the trench coats. you know.</i>

1333
01:06:52.287 --> 01:06:55.091
<i>I ran. I ran to them
and I grabbed one.</i>

1334
01:06:55.258 --> 01:06:57.160
<i>and I held it to my chest
real tight...</i>

1335
01:06:57.392 --> 01:06:59.361
<i>like it was like
my girlfriend or something.</i>

1336
01:06:59.494 --> 01:07:00.797
<i>It was. you know...</i>

1337
01:07:01.164 --> 01:07:02.330
<i>My sister's looking at me like.
"What are you doing?</i>

1338
01:07:03.298 --> 01:07:05.467
<i>Whenever I would be going
through something really bad.</i>

1339
01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:07.804
<i>whether it was
being bullied at school</i>

1340
01:07:07.937 --> 01:07:09.839
<i>or whether it was
being abused at home</i>

1341
01:07:10.206 --> 01:07:12.008
<i>I could escape.
I could leave the room.</i>

1342
01:07:12.141 --> 01:07:15.011
<i>I could escape
with the black trench coat on.</i>

1343
01:07:15.744 --> 01:07:17.213
<i>It was like the trench coat</i>

1344
01:07:17.345 --> 01:07:19.548
<i>was like a living.
breathing organism to me.</i>

1345
01:07:20.348 --> 01:07:22.717
<i>You know. It made me feel...</i>

1346
01:07:24.153 --> 01:07:26.289
<i>when I put it on.
it made me feel strong</i>

1347
01:07:27.056 --> 01:07:30.193
<i>it made me feel powerful.
unassailable.</i>

1348
01:07:30.358 --> 01:07:32.829
<i>It made me feel closer
to Neo than I ever been.</i>

1349
01:07:33.196 --> 01:07:36.866
<i>I would wear the trench coat
to the mall mainly.</i>

1350
01:07:36.999 --> 01:07:39.302
<i>I would walk around the mall
just all day</i>

1351
01:07:40.303 --> 01:07:43.005
<i>with the</i> Matrix <i>music</i>
<i>on my headphones.</i>

1352
01:07:43.139 --> 01:07:45.707
<i>I had the soundtrack...
it was in my CD player.</i>

1353
01:07:46.641 --> 01:07:48.144
<i>and people would
see me come in.</i>

1354
01:07:48.311 --> 01:07:50.146
<i>and they would just kind of
back away. you know.</i>

1355
01:07:50.279 --> 01:07:53.115
<i>And I had this sick thrill
of wearing it.</i>

1356
01:07:53.682 --> 01:07:55.750
<i>So being Neo. being Neo was...</i>

1357
01:07:56.319 --> 01:07:58.653
<i>I felt for a long time
it actually saved me.</i>

1358
01:07:58.788 --> 01:08:00.555
<i>but 'til a certain point.</i>

1359
01:08:01.290 --> 01:08:03.326
<i>You know. everything
that's really happened</i>

1360
01:08:03.458 --> 01:08:05.127
<i>with me
has kind of dichotomy.</i>

1361
01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:06.628
<i>sometimes a paradox.</i>

1362
01:08:08.197 --> 01:08:10.765
<i>I've probably watched</i>
The Matrix <i>movie...</i>

1363
01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:12.935
<i>I don't know exact.</i>

1364
01:08:13.102 --> 01:08:14.603
<i>but I know
it was hundreds of times.</i>

1365
01:08:14.971 --> 01:08:17.073
<i>After I saw it the first time.
I had to watch it again.</i>

1366
01:08:17.505 --> 01:08:18.875
<i>And then I had
to watch it again.</i>

1367
01:08:19.008 --> 01:08:20.877
<i>and I watched it again
and again and again.</i>

1368
01:08:21.043 --> 01:08:22.644
<i>There were days
when I would watch it</i>

1369
01:08:22.777 --> 01:08:24.412
<i>two or three times in a row.</i>

1370
01:08:25.314 --> 01:08:27.682
<i>And like the world
that they are in.</i>

1371
01:08:28.184 --> 01:08:32.054
<i>this boring. you know.
trite. mundane...</i>

1372
01:08:32.855 --> 01:08:36.325
<i>you know. just sickening world.
I felt the same way.</i>

1373
01:08:36.792 --> 01:08:38.526
<i>I just felt like
nothing was going right.</i>

1374
01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:39.862
<i>What the hell am I doing here?</i>

1375
01:08:40.096 --> 01:08:41.163
<i>And I felt like. "Man.
there's gotta be</i>

1376
01:08:41.297 --> 01:08:42.530
<i>more than this."</i>

1377
01:08:42.932 --> 01:08:44.233
<i>Maybe there's something</i>
<i>with this</i> Matrix <i>thing.</i>

1378
01:08:44.633 --> 01:08:46.102
<i>Maybe it's real.</i>

1379
01:08:46.302 --> 01:08:48.938
<i>Maybe it's not so fake
after all. You know. who knows?</i>

1380
01:08:58.814 --> 01:09:00.983
<i>One thing I really
want you to know.</i>

1381
01:09:01.217 --> 01:09:03.551
<i>these claims
can neither be proved</i>

1382
01:09:04.053 --> 01:09:07.089
<i>nor can they be even
made to sound rational</i>

1383
01:09:07.223 --> 01:09:08.858
<i>in the usual sense of the word.</i>

1384
01:09:10.092 --> 01:09:12.929
<i>It has taken me over
three years to reach the point</i>

1385
01:09:13.062 --> 01:09:14.864
<i>where I am willing
to tell anyone</i>

1386
01:09:14.997 --> 01:09:17.599
<i>but my closest friends
about my experience</i>

1387
01:09:17.867 --> 01:09:21.569
<i>beginning back
at the vernal equinox of 1974.</i>

1388
01:09:26.574 --> 01:09:28.344
One of the reasons
motivating me

1389
01:09:28.476 --> 01:09:30.346
to speak about it publicly
at last

1390
01:09:30.745 --> 01:09:32.480
to openly make this claim

1391
01:09:32.614 --> 01:09:35.084
is a recent encounter
I have undergone

1392
01:09:35.818 --> 01:09:39.621
which. by the way.
bears a strange resemblance

1393
01:09:40.189 --> 01:09:42.825
to Hawthorne Abendsen's
experience in my novel

1394
01:09:42.959 --> 01:09:45.995
<i>The Man in the High Castle</i>
with the woman Juliana Crain.

1395
01:09:51.733 --> 01:09:54.136
Juliana read Abendsen's book
about a world

1396
01:09:54.270 --> 01:09:56.839
in which Germany and Japan
and Italy...

1397
01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:01.743
Now this is a little difficult
if you haven't read the book.

1398
01:10:02.178 --> 01:10:05.680
but he wrote a novel
in which Germany.

1399
01:10:06.182 --> 01:10:09.952
<i>Italy and Japan
lost World War II.</i>

1400
01:10:10.618 --> 01:10:11.887
<i>And he was living in a world</i>

1401
01:10:12.054 --> 01:10:13.990
<i>in which
they had won World War II.</i>

1402
01:10:16.926 --> 01:10:18.094
She felt she should tell him

1403
01:10:18.227 --> 01:10:20.196
what she comprehended
about the book.

1404
01:10:21.596 --> 01:10:24.133
In other words.
that his novel was true.

1405
01:10:25.533 --> 01:10:27.303
<i>When I was working</i>
<i>on</i> Jimmy Corrigan.

1406
01:10:27.436 --> 01:10:29.905
<i>the main character meets
his dad. and then his dad dies.</i>

1407
01:10:33.042 --> 01:10:35.177
And as I was working
on the story itself.

1408
01:10:35.311 --> 01:10:38.180
<i>I met my dad for the first time
and then he died.</i>

1409
01:10:39.915 --> 01:10:41.851
John Updike said something
once about...

1410
01:10:42.251 --> 01:10:44.954
about the strange predictability
of fiction.

1411
01:10:45.354 --> 01:10:46.989
And he just kinda
let it go at that.

1412
01:10:47.123 --> 01:10:48.590
and didn't really
follow up on that.

1413
01:10:48.791 --> 01:10:50.259
But there is something
when you get into this...

1414
01:10:50.525 --> 01:10:52.061
imaginary world

1415
01:10:52.194 --> 01:10:54.430
of writing stories.
or reimagining memories

1416
01:10:54.562 --> 01:10:56.899
<i>where you can kind of
start to feel like you're...</i>

1417
01:10:57.632 --> 01:11:01.871
<i>not necessarily predicting
the world. but having some play</i>

1418
01:11:02.004 --> 01:11:03.806
<i>in the stream of it.
or something.</i>

1419
01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:09.677
For several years. I've had
the feeling. a growing feeling.

1420
01:11:10.012 --> 01:11:13.449
<i>that one day a woman. who would
be a complete stranger to me.</i>

1421
01:11:13.816 --> 01:11:16.318
<i>would contact me and tell me</i>

1422
01:11:16.584 --> 01:11:19.522
<i>that she had some information
to impart to me.</i>

1423
01:11:20.189 --> 01:11:22.124
<i>And then she would appear
at my door</i>

1424
01:11:22.458 --> 01:11:25.828
<i>just as Juliana appeared
at Hawthorne Abendsen's door.</i>

1425
01:11:26.128 --> 01:11:29.664
She would tell me exactly
what Juliana told Abendsen.

1426
01:11:30.032 --> 01:11:33.803
and that is that my book.
like his. was in a certain.

1427
01:11:33.936 --> 01:11:36.439
real. literal
and physical sense.

1428
01:11:36.571 --> 01:11:38.140
not fiction but the truth.

1429
01:11:40.176 --> 01:11:42.211
Well. this did
finally happen to me.

1430
01:11:43.446 --> 01:11:45.848
<i>I even knew
that her hair would be black.</i>

1431
01:11:47.917 --> 01:11:49.584
One of the first things
that a lot

1432
01:11:49.717 --> 01:11:51.020
of science fiction critics
remind you

1433
01:11:51.153 --> 01:11:52.654
when you're talking
about science fiction.

1434
01:11:52.788 --> 01:11:54.256
"Science fiction is
not about prediction."

1435
01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:56.058
<i>But of course people
think about it anyway.</i>

1436
01:11:56.258 --> 01:11:59.228
<i>And Dick has quite a few.
Like he's no slacker</i>

1437
01:11:59.361 --> 01:12:03.866
<i>in the actually anticipating
the future department.</i>

1438
01:12:04.033 --> 01:12:06.135
<i>especially around
consumer gadgets</i>

1439
01:12:06.268 --> 01:12:08.104
<i>and ideas about
consumer gadgets.</i>

1440
01:12:08.270 --> 01:12:10.806
<i>But I think
what's more prophetic</i>

1441
01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:12.141
<i>is just...</i>

1442
01:12:12.842 --> 01:12:16.345
<i>what if feels like
to be alive right now.</i>

1443
01:12:16.678 --> 01:12:21.616
<i>You know. to be confused...
ontologically confused.</i>

1444
01:12:21.749 --> 01:12:25.154
<i>Like. I'm not really sure
where reality is exactly.</i>

1445
01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:28.723
<i>I'm certainly convinced
that there's a lot of</i>

1446
01:12:28.858 --> 01:12:31.293
<i>very dark forces on the rise.</i>

1447
01:12:31.427 --> 01:12:33.796
<i>and there are things that
are trying to manipulate me</i>

1448
01:12:34.029 --> 01:12:35.898
<i>using information
or using my...</i>

1449
01:12:36.065 --> 01:12:38.501
<i>the fact that I'm still
a subject of capitalism.</i>

1450
01:12:38.633 --> 01:12:41.070
<i>and they're kind of
manipulating that.</i>

1451
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:42.770
<i>And. at the same time.
there's sort of like</i>

1452
01:12:42.905 --> 01:12:44.507
<i>deeper rumblings</i>

1453
01:12:44.639 --> 01:12:47.843
<i>in the nature of the world
that seem really unclear.</i>

1454
01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:52.014
<i>And at the same time.
people seem potentially drawn</i>

1455
01:12:52.148 --> 01:12:55.317
<i>into their own sort of
solipsistic world</i>

1456
01:12:55.451 --> 01:12:58.020
of like manipulating
with the world

1457
01:12:58.154 --> 01:12:59.588
<i>through all these interfaces</i>

1458
01:12:59.721 --> 01:13:01.457
<i>and kind of detaching in a way.</i>

1459
01:13:01.723 --> 01:13:04.126
even at the same time
you're completely bound up.

1460
01:13:04.293 --> 01:13:06.295
And that's a primal theme
in Dick.

1461
01:13:06.428 --> 01:13:08.864
is the tension between
our social reality.

1462
01:13:08.998 --> 01:13:10.866
the reality as
a social construction

1463
01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:14.537
that we are always able
to kind of fragment away from

1464
01:13:14.702 --> 01:13:17.206
in generally harrowing ways.

1465
01:13:17.339 --> 01:13:20.742
We go into solipsism.
we go into psychosis.

1466
01:13:20.976 --> 01:13:22.378
<i>we go into paranoia.</i>

1467
01:13:22.511 --> 01:13:24.446
Hey. guys. I used
to be one of you!

1468
01:13:24.813 --> 01:13:26.081
- Stop selling...
- <i>And so.</i>

1469
01:13:26.415 --> 01:13:29.751
<i>I think he captures
the texture of our life.</i>

1470
01:13:29.885 --> 01:13:32.221
<i>I mean. especially. like.
just as a trivial example...</i>

1471
01:13:32.354 --> 01:13:36.192
<i>the texture of like lots
of little alerts all the time.</i>

1472
01:13:36.325 --> 01:13:40.062
You know. pings on the phone
and here's your e-mail. ding!

1473
01:13:40.196 --> 01:13:41.564
And then.
"Oh. don't forget this."

1474
01:13:42.164 --> 01:13:45.201
<i>That kind of mind
that's constantly distracted</i>

1475
01:13:45.334 --> 01:13:48.204
<i>by these little bits
of information tugging at us.</i>

1476
01:13:48.337 --> 01:13:50.439
<i>Some of which are
advertisements trying to like...</i>

1477
01:13:50.738 --> 01:13:52.374
Or you start thinking
about a trip

1478
01:13:52.508 --> 01:13:54.476
and then you write
somebody an e-mail.

1479
01:13:54.610 --> 01:13:56.145
and Goggle reads your e-mail
and then suddenly

1480
01:13:56.278 --> 01:13:58.047
<i>all the adds are like.
"Trips! Trips! Trips!"</i>

1481
01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:02.918
<i>It's just like. "Whoa." that
fabric of consciousness</i>

1482
01:14:03.118 --> 01:14:06.922
is just straight out of this...

1483
01:14:08.958 --> 01:14:10.292
<i>I remember typing</i>

1484
01:14:10.426 --> 01:14:11.660
<i>"guns for sale"</i>

1485
01:14:11.794 --> 01:14:13.195
<i>on like Google.</i>

1486
01:14:13.929 --> 01:14:15.831
<i>And... In Fairfax. Virginia.</i>

1487
01:14:15.965 --> 01:14:19.134
<i>And I saw this place called
Galyan's Sporting Goods Store.</i>

1488
01:14:19.468 --> 01:14:21.237
<i>And I remember...</i>

1489
01:14:22.838 --> 01:14:25.773
<i>like a few days after
I looked that up. my father.</i>

1490
01:14:25.908 --> 01:14:27.876
<i>I was in the basement
with my father.</i>

1491
01:14:29.011 --> 01:14:30.946
<i>And he said.
"I've seen your searches</i>

01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:32.381
<i>for guns for sale."</i>

1493
01:14:33.949 --> 01:14:35.217
<i>And looked at me.</i>

1494
01:14:35.618 --> 01:14:39.054
<i>he had like this
worried/angry look on his face.</i>

1495
01:14:40.022 --> 01:14:41.590
<i>And I didn't say anything.
and I...</i>

1496
01:14:42.157 --> 01:14:43.993
<i>We looked at each other
for a good minute.</i>

1497
01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:46.128
<i>almost like a standoff.</i>

1498
01:14:46.428 --> 01:14:48.364
<i>And then I just walked up
the basement steps and left.</i>

1499
01:14:48.497 --> 01:14:50.899
<i>So we never had another
conversation about it.</i>

1500
01:14:53.168 --> 01:14:55.271
<i>He had this great line
about. that he thought</i>

1501
01:14:55.404 --> 01:14:56.939
<i>that the contemporary world</i>

1502
01:14:57.072 --> 01:14:59.508
<i>was sort of recreating
the animist world</i>

1503
01:14:59.642 --> 01:15:02.511
<i>that people.
pre-modern people saw.</i>

1504
01:15:04.013 --> 01:15:06.081
<i>And his work captures
that sense</i>

1505
01:15:06.215 --> 01:15:10.486
<i>of a kind of
profane technological animism.</i>

1506
01:15:10.653 --> 01:15:11.820
<i>and aliveness</i>

1507
01:15:12.187 --> 01:15:14.323
<i>that is not very trustworthy.</i>

1508
01:15:14.723 --> 01:15:15.758
I love you. daddy.

1509
01:15:16.292 --> 01:15:19.094
<i>Dick was
always aware of the broken.</i>

1510
01:15:19.228 --> 01:15:22.264
<i>People are broken.
Technologies are broken.</i>

1511
01:15:22.398 --> 01:15:25.834
<i>Cosmologies are broken.
Gods are broken.</i>

1512
01:15:28.170 --> 01:15:29.638
<i>Even though it seems like
other people</i>

1513
01:15:29.772 --> 01:15:31.573
<i>are just always paying
attention to like the new</i>

1514
01:15:31.707 --> 01:15:33.542
<i>and how the new technologies
can solve this thing...</i>

1515
01:15:33.676 --> 01:15:36.979
<i>Your plastic pal
who's fun to be with!</i>

1516
01:15:37.112 --> 01:15:40.683
<i>...what I experience
my technological life is like</i>

1517
01:15:40.816 --> 01:15:42.985
<i>is just a lot of broken things.</i>

1518
01:15:47.456 --> 01:15:49.491
<i>So. you have
your giant developers.</i>

1519
01:15:49.625 --> 01:15:51.093
<i>You have Activision Blizzard.</i>

1520
01:15:51.827 --> 01:15:54.563
<i>they do</i> World of Warcraft
<i>and</i> Overwatch.

1521
01:15:55.097 --> 01:15:57.599
<i>You have EA. which is...</i>

1522
01:15:59.702 --> 01:16:02.538
<i>I think I've seen EA
related to the Nazis</i>

1523
01:16:02.671 --> 01:16:04.840
<i>more than I've seen them
related to video games.</i>

1524
01:16:05.374 --> 01:16:06.975
They're pushing out
these things now

1525
01:16:07.109 --> 01:16:08.677
where you're paying full price
for a video game.

1526
01:16:08.812 --> 01:16:12.114
<i>but you're only getting like
40% of a video game.</i>

1527
01:16:12.581 --> 01:16:17.219
<i>And the portion you get
is broken and buggy.</i>

1528
01:16:17.453 --> 01:16:20.656
<i>And sometimes like literally.
in the case of some games.</i>

1529
01:16:20.889 --> 01:16:24.660
<i>like I think the latest one</i>
<i>was</i> Atlas. <i>it's unplayable.</i>

1530
01:16:24.794 --> 01:16:26.796
<i>Like it's literally dead
on arrival.</i>

1531
01:16:26.929 --> 01:16:28.697
<i>People were still paying
full price for it</i>

1532
01:16:28.864 --> 01:16:30.999
<i>and getting tricked into it.
You can't get refunds.</i>

1533
01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:33.235
<i>They get patches
that don't work.</i>

1534
01:16:34.036 --> 01:16:35.137
<i>You're stuck
in these digital worlds</i>

1535
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:36.538
<i>that aren't going so well.</i>

1536
01:16:36.739 --> 01:16:37.873
<i>And then.
when you get out of them.</i>

1537
01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:39.308
<i>you're stuck in a reality</i>

1538
01:16:39.441 --> 01:16:40.876
<i>that's not going so well
either.</i>

1539
01:16:42.111 --> 01:16:44.079
<i>And you can't help
draw parallels.</i>

1540
01:16:44.646 --> 01:16:47.516
The grass is dead
on both sides of this thing.

1541
01:16:48.884 --> 01:16:50.586
<i>Perhaps right now.
maybe our artifices</i>

1542
01:16:50.886 --> 01:16:53.455
<i>are a little bit more active
than we thought.</i>

1543
01:16:53.655 --> 01:16:55.657
<i>And they're just like really
hot-fixing a lot of things.</i>

1544
01:16:55.792 --> 01:16:57.960
<i>and they're quick-patching
reality right now.</i>

1545
01:16:58.093 --> 01:16:59.261
<i>and it's just like.</i>

1546
01:16:59.428 --> 01:17:00.362
<i>shit's hitting
the fan right now.</i>

1547
01:17:01.397 --> 01:17:02.765
<i>That's what's happening</i>

1548
01:17:02.898 --> 01:17:05.667
<i>outside the Matrix
in Neo's world. too.</i>

1549
01:17:05.802 --> 01:17:07.102
<i>It's like the real reality.</i>

1550
01:17:07.236 --> 01:17:09.104
<i>if you get outside
of the Matrix</i>

1551
01:17:09.571 --> 01:17:10.874
<i>is terrible.</i>

1552
01:17:11.039 --> 01:17:14.109
<i>The real reality is like war.
and you can't breathe.</i>

1553
01:17:14.243 --> 01:17:17.012
To me. the subtext of that
is maybe there was

1554
01:17:17.379 --> 01:17:19.548
a taboo that we transgressed.

1555
01:17:19.681 --> 01:17:22.384
that we went past
the point of no return.

1556
01:17:23.252 --> 01:17:27.689
<i>February 17th. 2003.</i>

1557
01:17:27.923 --> 01:17:29.124
<i>It was a Monday.</i>

1558
01:17:30.993 --> 01:17:33.495
<i>I woke up. There was
a whole lot of snow outside</i>

1559
01:17:33.629 --> 01:17:36.231
<i>from a recent blizzard
we had just had.</i>

1560
01:17:36.698 --> 01:17:40.837
<i>And I walked downstairs.
I saw my father shoveling snow.</i>

1561
01:17:40.969 --> 01:17:44.139
<i>So I got my clothes on
and helped him shovel the snow.</i>

1562
01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:48.610
<i>And in the middle of doing that
I remember my mother came out</i>

1563
01:17:48.812 --> 01:17:51.613
<i>and she looked up and she said.
"There's so much snow.</i>

1564
01:17:51.747 --> 01:17:54.149
<i>We're gonna remember this
for a long time."</i>

1565
01:17:55.517 --> 01:17:57.953
<i>I spent the rest of the day
in my room</i>

1566
01:17:58.086 --> 01:17:59.889
<i>playing violent video games</i>

1567
01:18:00.022 --> 01:18:03.559
<i>and watching</i> The Matrix <i>movie</i>
<i>with my black trench coat on</i>

1568
01:18:03.927 --> 01:18:05.561
<i>and my gun in my hand.</i>

1569
01:18:07.396 --> 01:18:09.331
<i>As evening time continued...</i>

1570
01:18:11.366 --> 01:18:14.536
<i>paranoia sunk in even further.</i>

1571
01:18:15.170 --> 01:18:16.972
<i>Lightning struck my brain.</i>

1572
01:18:18.474 --> 01:18:19.508
<i>And this is what hit me.</i>

1573
01:18:20.209 --> 01:18:24.680
<i>I said to myself. the only way
I could find out for sure.</i>

1574
01:18:24.848 --> 01:18:26.982
<i>I could find out for sure</i>

1575
01:18:27.416 --> 01:18:29.151
<i>if the Matrix was real</i>

1576
01:18:29.418 --> 01:18:30.954
<i>and I wasn't losing my mind</i>

1577
01:18:31.687 --> 01:18:35.190
<i>was to simply pick up
the phone and call them.</i>

1578
01:18:36.458 --> 01:18:40.797
<i>I left my room
and I walked precariously</i>

1579
01:18:41.597 --> 01:18:44.233
<i>over to the house phone
in my parents' bedroom.</i>

1580
01:18:58.247 --> 01:19:00.716
<i>I slowly picked the phone
up off the hook</i>

1581
01:19:01.316 --> 01:19:04.520
<i>and then. taking a deep.
nervous breath</i>

1582
01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:08.023
<i>I spoke those powerful words.
his words.</i>

1583
01:19:08.757 --> 01:19:09.926
<i>the final words of Neo.</i>

1584
01:19:10.659 --> 01:19:13.897
<i>"I know you're out there.
I can feel you now.</i>

1585
01:19:14.463 --> 01:19:15.832
<i>I know that you're afraid.</i>

1586
01:19:16.966 --> 01:19:20.269
<i>You're afraid of us.
You're afraid of change.</i>

1587
01:19:21.537 --> 01:19:22.939
<i>I don't know the future.</i>

1588
01:19:23.272 --> 01:19:25.808
<i>I didn't come here to tell you
how this is going to end.</i>

1589
01:19:26.174 --> 01:19:29.611
<i>I came here to tell you how
it's going to begin.</i>

1590
01:19:30.445 --> 01:19:31.915
<i>You're gonna hang up
this phone.</i>

1591
01:19:32.314 --> 01:19:33.582
<i>and then I'm going to show
these people</i>

1592
01:19:33.715 --> 01:19:35.317
<i>what you don't want them
to see.</i>

1593
01:19:35.852 --> 01:19:37.152
<i>A world without you.</i>

1594
01:19:37.854 --> 01:19:40.155
<i>A world without rules
and controls.</i>

1595
01:19:40.289 --> 01:19:41.490
<i>without borders or boundaries.</i>

1596
01:19:41.723 --> 01:19:44.760
<i>A world where
anything's possible.</i>

1597
01:19:47.997 --> 01:19:50.833
<i>Where we go from there
is a choice up to you."</i>

1598
01:19:51.099 --> 01:19:52.467
<i>And I hung up the phone</i>

1599
01:19:52.701 --> 01:19:56.039
<i>and I walked calmly back
to the TV in my room</i>

1600
01:19:56.405 --> 01:19:58.808
<i>and began watching</i> The Matrix
<i>all over again.</i>

1601
01:20:00.776 --> 01:20:03.278
<i>And I remember
sitting there on my bed</i>

1602
01:20:03.412 --> 01:20:04.847
<i>looking up at</i>
The Matrix <i>poster.</i>

1603
01:20:05.014 --> 01:20:09.151
<i>just saying basically.
"Fuck my life." you know?</i>

1604
01:20:09.618 --> 01:20:12.287
<i>I got my shotgun out and I...</i>

1605
01:20:14.556 --> 01:20:17.225
<i>I put some slugs in there.
in the chamber...</i>

1606
01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:22.764
<i>and I slid the action forward.
and I left my room.</i>

1607
01:20:22.899 --> 01:20:28.437
<i>But before I did.
I put a CD player on my head.</i>

1608
01:20:28.871 --> 01:20:30.172
<i>headphones on my head.</i>

1609
01:20:30.305 --> 01:20:31.707
<i>And this one was
a little different</i>

1610
01:20:31.841 --> 01:20:33.009
<i>than</i> The Matrix.

1611
01:20:33.308 --> 01:20:35.477
<i>This one was by a band
called Drowning Pool.</i>

1612
01:20:36.345 --> 01:20:38.447
<i>The words to the song were.</i>

1613
01:20:38.982 --> 01:20:42.351
<i>"Beaten why for
Can't take much more</i>

1614
01:20:42.684 --> 01:20:45.554
<i>Something's got to give
Let the bodies hit the floor"</i>

1615
01:20:52.895 --> 01:20:55.631
<i>That's what I was listening to
as I left my room</i>

1616
01:20:56.099 --> 01:21:00.202
<i>and I went downstairs to get
to the basement.</i>

1617
01:21:20.957 --> 01:21:22.491
<i>And I remember</i>

1618
01:21:22.624 --> 01:21:24.760
<i>when I got to the
bottom of the basement stairs</i>

1619
01:21:25.028 --> 01:21:27.462
<i>I saw my mother was sitting
there at the computer</i>

1620
01:21:27.629 --> 01:21:28.697
<i>with a smile on her face.</i>

1621
01:21:29.364 --> 01:21:32.935
<i>And she turned. she swiveled
in her chair to face me</i>

1622
01:21:33.069 --> 01:21:35.637
<i>and when she saw the gun
in my hand.</i>

1623
01:21:35.771 --> 01:21:38.875
<i>which she's seeing
for the first time ever.</i>

1624
01:21:39.508 --> 01:21:42.912
<i>her smile disappeared.
and I shot her.</i>

1625
01:21:43.512 --> 01:21:44.914
<i>I shot her in the chest.</i>

1626
01:21:45.747 --> 01:21:47.649
<i>And I turned my attention
to my father.</i>

1627
01:21:47.784 --> 01:21:49.418
<i>who was on the other side
of the basement</i>

1628
01:21:49.685 --> 01:21:53.188
<i>and he dove.
He was at his computer. too.</i>

1629
01:21:53.388 --> 01:21:55.091
<i>And he dove under the table.</i>

1630
01:21:55.357 --> 01:21:57.426
<i>and he was looking at me</i>

1631
01:21:57.559 --> 01:22:01.030
<i>with a look I've never seen
on him before.</i>

1632
01:22:01.463 --> 01:22:04.266
<i>And just that look of shock
and disbelief.</i>

1633
01:22:05.034 --> 01:22:08.403
<i>And I remember I crouched down
to be level with him</i>

1634
01:22:08.537 --> 01:22:10.706
<i>and I shot him about
three times.</i>

1635
01:22:26.089 --> 01:22:28.825
<i>I went upstairs to reload</i>

1636
01:22:29.257 --> 01:22:30.893
<i>and when I came back down...</i>

1637
01:22:31.593 --> 01:22:34.596
<i>Oh. I still had
my headphones on.</i>

1638
01:22:35.098 --> 01:22:37.834
<i>The words that were forced
into my ears were.</i>

1639
01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:41.336
<i>"Skin against skin
Blood and bone</i>

1640
01:22:41.804 --> 01:22:44.207
<i>You're all by yourself
But you're not alone</i>

1641
01:22:44.673 --> 01:22:46.675
<i>You wanted in
Now you're here</i>

1642
01:22:47.043 --> 01:22:49.344
<i>Driven by hate
Consumed by fear</i>

1643
01:22:49.745 --> 01:22:51.480
<i>Let the bodies hit the floor"</i>

1644
01:22:52.414 --> 01:22:53.783
<i>That's what I was listening to</i>

1645
01:22:53.950 --> 01:22:55.985
<i>when I went down
for the second time</i>

1646
01:22:56.119 --> 01:22:57.319
<i>to the basement.</i>

1647
01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:06.996
<i>I was standing at the top
of the basement staircase.</i>

1648
01:23:07.130 --> 01:23:09.966
<i>and my mother was standing
at the bottom of the staircase.</i>

1649
01:23:10.665 --> 01:23:12.334
<i>holding her chest
as she bled out.</i>

1650
01:23:12.902 --> 01:23:17.907
<i>And I lifted the gun up
and I aimed it at her face.</i>

1651
01:23:18.107 --> 01:23:19.942
<i>She looked up at me
and she said...</i>

1652
01:23:20.675 --> 01:23:23.179
<i>she said. "Joshua."</i>

1653
01:23:23.846 --> 01:23:25.280
<i>She said. "What did you do?"</i>

1654
01:23:26.215 --> 01:23:30.485
<i>And she kept looking at me
for a minute. and she said...</i>

1655
01:23:31.788 --> 01:23:33.022
<i>she said. "You wouldn't."</i>

1656
01:23:33.722 --> 01:23:35.057
<i>And I pulled the trigger.</i>

1657
01:23:37.392 --> 01:23:39.494
<i>When I pulled the
trigger and...</i>

1658
01:23:40.662 --> 01:23:41.964
<i>her face exploded.</i>

1659
01:23:43.732 --> 01:23:46.368
<i>Half her face. her eye
and her face exploded out</i>

1660
01:23:46.501 --> 01:23:47.469
<i>through the back of her head...</i>

1661
01:23:48.237 --> 01:23:52.241
<i>and her flesh was just
turned into like ripplets.</i>

1662
01:23:52.374 --> 01:23:53.608
<i>a bloody mess.</i>

1663
01:23:53.742 --> 01:23:55.812
<i>And it messed me up
really bad</i>

1664
01:23:55.945 --> 01:24:00.149
<i>because it wasn't anything like</i>
<i>I had seen on</i> The Matrix.

1665
01:24:00.850 --> 01:24:04.319
<i>You know? Real life
was so much more horrific.</i>

1666
01:24:04.653 --> 01:24:07.290
<i>It kind of jarred me.
I was still pretty numb.</i>

1667
01:24:07.824 --> 01:24:09.491
<i>but I remember it jarring me</i>

1668
01:24:09.724 --> 01:24:12.627
<i>'cause it was different than</i>
<i>what I thought of</i> The Matrix.

1669
01:24:15.798 --> 01:24:18.034
<i>So I turned around
and I went upstairs</i>

1670
01:24:18.333 --> 01:24:20.937
<i>into the dining room.</i>

1671
01:24:21.170 --> 01:24:23.172
<i>I picked up the phone
in the kitchen.</i>

1672
01:24:23.738 --> 01:24:25.574
<i>and my sister was on the phone.</i>

1673
01:24:25.707 --> 01:24:27.076
<i>I didn't realize at the time</i>

1674
01:24:27.210 --> 01:24:29.544
<i>that my sister
was on the phone with my father</i>

1675
01:24:30.012 --> 01:24:32.747
<i>at the exact moment that
I killed him and my mother.</i>

1676
01:24:33.115 --> 01:24:35.852
<i>She heard the whole thing.
and I didn't realize it.</i>

1677
01:24:35.985 --> 01:24:37.053
<i>So here I am.</i>

1678
01:24:37.452 --> 01:24:39.487
<i>I'm at the phone in the kitchen
and I said. "Hello?"</i>

1679
01:24:40.189 --> 01:24:43.292
<i>And my sister said. "Josh?"
And I said. "Tiffany?"</i>

1680
01:24:43.592 --> 01:24:44.861
<i>I said.
"What are you doing here?"</i>

1681
01:24:45.061 --> 01:24:46.628
<i>And she said.
"Josh. where's Daddy?</i>

1682
01:24:46.761 --> 01:24:48.097
<i>I wanna talk to Daddy."</i>

1683
01:24:48.630 --> 01:24:50.099
<i>And I told her. I said.</i>

1684
01:24:50.266 --> 01:24:52.335
<i>"Hang up the phone. Tiffany.
I gotta call someone."</i>

1685
01:24:53.102 --> 01:24:55.570
<i>And she didn't hang up.
so I let the phone hang</i>

1686
01:24:55.704 --> 01:24:59.008
<i>and I went to.
my father had a cell phone.</i>

1687
01:24:59.141 --> 01:25:01.344
<i>I went to his cell phone.
I went outside.</i>

1688
01:25:02.311 --> 01:25:06.581
<i>I took a Coca-Cola
out of the refrigerator</i>

1689
01:25:07.183 --> 01:25:08.550
<i>and I started to drink...</i>

1690
01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:10.019
<i>I popped the top
and I started drinking it.</i>

1691
01:25:10.152 --> 01:25:11.586
<i>and I called 911.</i>

1692
01:25:12.654 --> 01:25:14.090
<i>When I hung the phone up...</i>

1693
01:25:15.191 --> 01:25:18.794
<i>I got a call on my dad's phone
from a friend of his.</i>

1694
01:25:19.095 --> 01:25:23.698
<i>And my dad's friend said.
"Hey. Josh. is your dad there?"</i>

1695
01:25:24.233 --> 01:25:26.768
<i>And I said. "He can't come
to the phone right now."</i>

1696
01:25:27.535 --> 01:25:28.838
<i>And he said. "Oh. okay.</i>

1697
01:25:28.971 --> 01:25:30.505
<i>Will you give him
a message for me?</i>

1698
01:25:30.639 --> 01:25:31.640
<i>Just tell him I called."</i>

1699
01:25:32.275 --> 01:25:34.676
<i>Said. "Will you give him that
message for me?"</i>

1700
01:25:35.278 --> 01:25:36.345
<i>And I said. "Sure."</i>

1701
01:25:37.113 --> 01:25:39.714
<i>And he hung up the phone.
I hung up the phone.</i>

1702
01:25:39.882 --> 01:25:41.416
<i>And moments later.</i>

1703
01:25:41.549 --> 01:25:44.387
<i>the police arrived
at the driveway of my house</i>

1704
01:25:44.552 --> 01:25:45.955
<i>with their guns drawn.</i>

1705
01:25:46.289 --> 01:25:49.591
<i>About five or six of them
with their guns drawn on me...</i>

1706
01:25:50.592 --> 01:25:52.328
<i>told me to get
down on my knees.</i>

1707
01:25:52.460 --> 01:25:54.496
<i>and of course they arrested me.</i>

1708
01:26:07.276 --> 01:26:09.045
<i>I. in my stories
and novels.</i>

1709
01:26:09.178 --> 01:26:11.113
<i>often write about
counterfeit worlds</i>

1710
01:26:11.613 --> 01:26:15.483
<i>semi-real worlds. as well as
deranged private worlds</i>

1711
01:26:15.717 --> 01:26:17.954
<i>inhabited often
by just one person.</i>

1712
01:26:18.254 --> 01:26:20.222
<i>while meantime
the other characters</i>

1713
01:26:20.356 --> 01:26:22.557
<i>either remain
in their own worlds throughout</i>

1714
01:26:22.925 --> 01:26:25.828
<i>or are somehow drawn into
one of the peculiar ones.</i>

1715
01:26:26.461 --> 01:26:29.932
<i>This theme occurs in the corpus
of my 27 years of writing.</i>

1716
01:26:30.433 --> 01:26:32.802
<i>At no time did I have
a theoretical</i>

1717
01:26:32.935 --> 01:26:35.670
<i>or conscious explanation
for my preoccupation</i>

1718
01:26:35.905 --> 01:26:38.274
<i>with these pluriform
pseudo-worlds.</i>

1719
01:26:38.573 --> 01:26:40.376
<i>But now I think I understand.</i>

1720
01:26:40.675 --> 01:26:42.744
<i>What I was sensing
was the manifold</i>

1721
01:26:42.878 --> 01:26:46.315
<i>of partially actualized reality
lying tangent</i>

1722
01:26:46.449 --> 01:26:49.251
<i>to what evidently
is the most actualized one.</i>

1723
01:26:49.584 --> 01:26:54.522
The one which the majority of us
by consensus gentium agree on.

1724
01:26:56.392 --> 01:26:57.726
The real nub of it.

1725
01:26:58.194 --> 01:27:01.864
morally. ethically.
even kind of cosmologically...

1726
01:27:01.998 --> 01:27:04.166
is how we deal with each other.

1727
01:27:04.566 --> 01:27:06.902
Like. okay I'm in a simulation.

1728
01:27:07.036 --> 01:27:08.804
<i>Okay. I'm in a false.
phenomenal world.</i>

1729
01:27:08.938 --> 01:27:11.874
How do I deal with this person
I'm in love with?

1730
01:27:12.008 --> 01:27:14.676
How do I deal with this person
who is my enemy?

1731
01:27:14.910 --> 01:27:17.313
<i>How do I deal
with a dying parent?</i>

1732
01:27:17.579 --> 01:27:20.950
<i>But if I have the hunch
that this is a simulation</i>

1733
01:27:21.217 --> 01:27:23.786
<i>and there are other people
like me there</i>

1734
01:27:23.919 --> 01:27:26.122
<i>who aren't just simulations.</i>

1735
01:27:26.255 --> 01:27:28.924
<i>it puts weird pressure
on my ethics.</i>

1736
01:27:29.492 --> 01:27:32.461
<i>How do I deal with somebody
else who's in a false world</i>

1737
01:27:32.627 --> 01:27:36.866
<i>but who's actually behind
that avatar is someone like me.</i>

1738
01:27:36.999 --> 01:27:38.801
<i>that I really want
to communicate with.</i>

1739
01:27:38.968 --> 01:27:41.170
<i>fall in love with.
bond together with.</i>

1740
01:27:41.303 --> 01:27:43.638
And that's really key
to Phil Dick.

1741
01:27:43.772 --> 01:27:45.508
Like yeah. Phil Dick
was kinda crazy.

1742
01:27:45.774 --> 01:27:48.144
He had visions

1743
01:27:48.277 --> 01:27:49.778
he could never decide
what they meant.

1744
01:27:49.945 --> 01:27:52.614
he's neurotic and pathological
and paranoid

1745
01:27:52.747 --> 01:27:53.849
and all those things.

1746
01:27:54.083 --> 01:27:56.819
but at the same time.
constantly.

1747
01:27:57.053 --> 01:27:58.788
throughout all of the texts.

1748
01:27:59.155 --> 01:28:03.359
<i>there's this
very grounded empathy</i>

1749
01:28:03.558 --> 01:28:08.064
<i>with people suffering
under these false conditions.</i>

1750
01:28:09.865 --> 01:28:12.334
<i>This very real portrayal.</i>

1751
01:28:12.468 --> 01:28:15.570
<i>very sobering portrayals of
human beings that are still...</i>

1752
01:28:15.971 --> 01:28:17.206
<i>they have a heart.</i>

1753
01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:19.875
<i>And that heart is what
kind of keeps you going</i>

1754
01:28:20.009 --> 01:28:23.946
<i>as you suffer these various
nightmare scenarios</i>

1755
01:28:24.113 --> 01:28:26.482
<i>that he throws your way.
including the ultimate one</i>

1756
01:28:26.614 --> 01:28:27.850
of just not knowing.

1757
01:28:28.384 --> 01:28:30.752
And I think that that's
one of the ways that people

1758
01:28:30.886 --> 01:28:33.055
get attracted
to simulation hypothesis

1759
01:28:33.255 --> 01:28:36.624
is because it seems
to maybe solve problems.

1760
01:28:37.259 --> 01:28:40.595
But I think it just makes
the problems even more...

1761
01:28:41.363 --> 01:28:44.133
you know. kind of poignant
and in your face.

1762
01:28:47.436 --> 01:28:49.704
<i>So when I met my lawyers</i>

1763
01:28:49.839 --> 01:28:52.308
<i>for the first time
in Fairfax jail</i>

1764
01:28:52.441 --> 01:28:55.777
<i>they asked me about
my crime and...</i>

1765
01:28:55.945 --> 01:28:57.346
<i>and I told them I said.</i>

1766
01:28:57.612 --> 01:28:59.448
<i>"I did my thing</i>
<i>just like Neo in</i> The Matrix.

1767
01:29:00.182 --> 01:29:02.218
<i>Like I was in virtual reality."</i>

1768
01:29:03.319 --> 01:29:06.789
<i>And that really took them
by surprise.</i>

1769
01:29:06.922 --> 01:29:08.090
<i>They weren't expecting that.</i>

1770
01:29:08.524 --> 01:29:10.993
<i>I also told them
that the moment of my crime.</i>

1771
01:29:11.794 --> 01:29:13.761
<i>I had also felt
a tinge of remorse.</i>

1772
01:29:14.163 --> 01:29:16.764
<i>because it was
two strong things</i>

1773
01:29:16.899 --> 01:29:18.300
<i>at the same time.</i>

1774
01:29:18.534 --> 01:29:21.070
<i>that I was entering the world.
or exiting the world</i>

1775
01:29:21.203 --> 01:29:22.238
<i>of the Matrix.</i>

1776
01:29:22.670 --> 01:29:25.007
<i>And then real life.
with what I did to my parents.</i>

1777
01:29:26.041 --> 01:29:28.244
<i>My lawyers later
went to my house.</i>

1778
01:29:28.444 --> 01:29:30.212
<i>and they went upstairs
to my room</i>

1779
01:29:30.346 --> 01:29:35.951
<i>and they saw my enormous</i>
Matrix <i>movie poster on my wall.</i>

1780
01:29:36.385 --> 01:29:38.187
<i>And they saw
my black trench coat</i>

1781
01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:40.556
<i>laying out on my bed.
smoothed out on my bed.</i>

1782
01:29:40.688 --> 01:29:42.057
<i>They saw my black boots.</i>

1783
01:29:42.958 --> 01:29:44.426
<i>The ones like Neo wore.</i>

1784
01:29:45.528 --> 01:29:46.896
<i>And they began to think</i>

1785
01:29:47.263 --> 01:29:50.232
<i>that they may have
an insanity defense.</i>

1786
01:29:53.235 --> 01:29:56.605
<i>They said that I. quote.
"Harbored a bona fide belief</i>

1787
01:29:56.738 --> 01:29:59.774
<i>that I was living in</i>
<i>the virtual world of</i> The Matrix

1788
01:30:00.209 --> 01:30:01.743
<i>at the time of the murders."</i>

1789
01:30:02.545 --> 01:30:04.180
<i>That was part of my defense.</i>

1790
01:30:05.314 --> 01:30:07.516
- This isn't real?
- What is real?

1791
01:30:07.749 --> 01:30:09.485
<i>Which was later dubbed</i>

1792
01:30:09.618 --> 01:30:10.685
<i>The Matrix Defense.</i>

1793
01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:12.254
<i>The Matrix Defense</i>

1794
01:30:12.388 --> 01:30:14.123
<i>is a version of
the insanity defense</i>

1795
01:30:14.290 --> 01:30:16.659
<i>and is a descendant
of The Taxi Driver Defense</i>

1796
01:30:16.792 --> 01:30:17.826
<i>of John Hinckley.</i>

1797
01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:22.064
<i>It has been used multiple times
since Joshua's trial.</i>

1798
01:30:22.298 --> 01:30:26.468
<i>most notably by Lee Malvo.
aka The D.C. Sniper.</i>

1799
01:30:27.303 --> 01:30:29.171
<i>The doctor. the psychologist.</i>

1800
01:30:29.905 --> 01:30:31.574
<i>Dr. Shostak. he diagnosed me</i>

1801
01:30:31.706 --> 01:30:34.310
<i>with a form of schizophrenia
called simple schizophrenia.</i>

1802
01:30:34.510 --> 01:30:36.579
<i>and that's when he made
the declaration</i>

1803
01:30:36.711 --> 01:30:39.747
<i>that people are scarcely real
to me and things like that.</i>

1804
01:30:40.683 --> 01:30:43.886
<i>There were different events
that happened in my life.</i>

1805
01:30:44.453 --> 01:30:47.623
<i>different things I was feeling
that were in a combination</i>

1806
01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:49.491
<i>led up to me exploding.</i>

1807
01:30:50.526 --> 01:30:51.961
<i>The abuse I had been suffering</i>

1808
01:30:52.094 --> 01:30:54.230
<i>from my parents at home
for many. many years.</i>

1809
01:30:54.430 --> 01:30:56.198
<i>And then I had the bullying
at school</i>

1810
01:30:56.599 --> 01:31:00.436
<i>and the undiagnosed
mental illness I had for years.</i>

1811
01:31:00.569 --> 01:31:01.971
<i>And all of that together</i>

1812
01:31:02.104 --> 01:31:03.973
<i>kind of formed
a ticking time bomb.</i>

1813
01:31:04.772 --> 01:31:06.408
<i>I call it the perfect storm.</i>

1814
01:31:06.542 --> 01:31:12.014
<i>But I. myself. I never made
any excuses for my crime.</i>

1815
01:31:12.381 --> 01:31:14.516
<i>And I just wanted to die.
you know?</i>

1816
01:31:14.650 --> 01:31:17.586
<i>It was like. just forget about
all of this stuff. you know.</i>

1817
01:31:18.254 --> 01:31:19.455
<i>And as a matter of fact.</i>

1818
01:31:19.588 --> 01:31:21.090
<i>at the end
of my sentence hearing</i>

1819
01:31:21.223 --> 01:31:23.559
<i>I got to say
a written statement</i>

1820
01:31:23.692 --> 01:31:25.160
<i>to the judge out loud there.</i>

1821
01:31:25.294 --> 01:31:28.264
<i>And there I just.
I told him that</i>

1822
01:31:28.697 --> 01:31:29.898
<i>I wasn't making any excuses.</i>

1823
01:31:30.032 --> 01:31:31.433
<i>and I deserved
the death penalty.</i>

1824
01:31:31.567 --> 01:31:32.468
<i>I deserved to die.</i>

1825
01:31:33.102 --> 01:31:35.404
<i>And I think about
what I did every day.</i>

1826
01:31:35.604 --> 01:31:37.606
<i>I wish I could take it back.
You know?</i>

1827
01:31:38.307 --> 01:31:40.409
<i>Ultimately. Joshua decided not</i>

1828
01:31:40.542 --> 01:31:43.045
<i>to pursue The Matrix Defense
and pled guilty.</i>

1829
01:31:43.612 --> 01:31:46.015
<i>He was 19 years old
when convicted.</i>

1830
01:31:46.682 --> 01:31:50.519
<i>He is not due to be released
until 2043.</i>

1831
01:31:52.087 --> 01:31:53.622
<i>The movie.</i>
The Matrix <i>movie</i>

1832
01:31:53.756 --> 01:31:56.091
<i>has affected people
in all sorts of different ways.</i>

1833
01:31:56.292 --> 01:31:57.960
<i>It all depends
on where you're coming from</i>

1834
01:31:58.093 --> 01:31:59.228
<i>and the psychology of it.</i>

1835
01:31:59.762 --> 01:32:01.930
<i>Mine is just kind of
an extreme case.</i>

1836
01:32:02.665 --> 01:32:04.700
<i>There are people
out there today</i>

1837
01:32:05.134 --> 01:32:06.635
<i>who may be listening to this</i>

1838
01:32:06.769 --> 01:32:09.338
<i>that are going through
the same things that I was.</i>

1839
01:32:10.039 --> 01:32:11.440
<i>And this is
the whole reason why</i>

1840
01:32:11.573 --> 01:32:13.776
<i>I'm even talking
about this today</i>

1841
01:32:14.410 --> 01:32:17.146
<i>because I know
I have a purpose.</i>

1842
01:32:17.279 --> 01:32:19.348
<i>a calling in my life
to try to reach them.</i>

1843
01:32:20.349 --> 01:32:22.951
<i>Joshua wrote
a book about his experience</i>

1844
01:32:23.085 --> 01:32:25.087
<i>in hopes of reaching
other troubled kids</i>

1845
01:32:25.220 --> 01:32:28.090
<i>and stopping them
from repeating his mistakes.</i>

1846
01:32:29.725 --> 01:32:31.894
Now that I'm in my mid-40's...

1847
01:32:32.661 --> 01:32:36.365
I am actually finally able
to deal with people

1848
01:32:36.498 --> 01:32:37.433
as human beings.

1849
01:32:38.267 --> 01:32:39.935
And you could
think of it one way.

1850
01:32:40.135 --> 01:32:42.538
if people are simulated.
they're getting better

1851
01:32:42.671 --> 01:32:44.006
and they're easier to relate to.

1852
01:32:44.139 --> 01:32:47.476
but is it possible
that I saw everyone

1853
01:32:47.609 --> 01:32:50.612
as these sort of robotic
humans walking around

1854
01:32:50.879 --> 01:32:53.248
because I couldn't
figure them out

1855
01:32:53.415 --> 01:32:55.250
because of a problem
with my brain?

1856
01:32:55.684 --> 01:32:56.885
And that's the thing.

1857
01:32:57.052 --> 01:32:59.121
I never wanna get locked
into the idea

1858
01:32:59.254 --> 01:33:00.456
that this is all fake

1859
01:33:00.723 --> 01:33:02.391
if in fact the reason
I thought it was fake

1860
01:33:02.524 --> 01:33:05.260
is because it was an easier
way for me to deal

1861
01:33:05.394 --> 01:33:08.163
with the complexity
of human existence.

1862
01:33:09.465 --> 01:33:15.871
I feel like being fully
in the body with another

1863
01:33:16.472 --> 01:33:19.408
is like sort of maybe
like seeing the light. you know?

1864
01:33:19.541 --> 01:33:22.611
It's the "petite mort"
of orgasm.

1865
01:33:22.745 --> 01:33:25.981
Or just like the fusing
of consciousness with an other.

1866
01:33:26.115 --> 01:33:27.549
<i>Audre Lorde talks about
the erotic.</i>

1867
01:33:27.683 --> 01:33:33.055
And I think the erotic
as a dynamic in reality

1868
01:33:33.188 --> 01:33:35.457
is an antidote to solipsism.

1869
01:33:35.591 --> 01:33:37.626
It's an antidote
to a lack of empathy.

1870
01:33:37.794 --> 01:33:39.261
Because it allows us to sort of

1871
01:33:39.395 --> 01:33:42.030
have a playful relationship
to the other.

1872
01:33:42.297 --> 01:33:44.533
<i>There's that scene</i>
<i>in</i> The Matrix Reloaded

1873
01:33:44.666 --> 01:33:48.170
<i>where Morpheus gives a speech
and tells everyone</i>

1874
01:33:48.303 --> 01:33:49.938
<i>that they're about
to be attacked</i>

1875
01:33:50.072 --> 01:33:51.273
<i>by the machines.</i>

1876
01:33:51.507 --> 01:33:53.409
<i>This might be
their last night alive.</i>

1877
01:33:53.776 --> 01:33:57.646
The machines have gathered
an army. and as I speak

1878
01:33:58.113 --> 01:34:00.749
that army is drawing nearer
to our home.

1879
01:34:04.086 --> 01:34:05.421
<i>So. what do they do?</i>

1880
01:34:05.822 --> 01:34:07.623
<i>They play music. They dance.</i>

1881
01:34:07.824 --> 01:34:11.059
<i>And in the midst
of this stew of flesh...</i>

1882
01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:15.531
<i>Trinity and Neo sneak off
to this catacomb and make love.</i>

1883
01:34:16.298 --> 01:34:18.467
<i>This is a scene
that gets parodied a lot.</i>

1884
01:34:18.634 --> 01:34:20.736
<i>I think it's easy
to not take it seriously</i>

1885
01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:22.137
<i>because it's so earnest.</i>

1886
01:34:22.839 --> 01:34:24.273
<i>But it's also very tender.</i>

1887
01:34:24.506 --> 01:34:26.575
<i>It shows the characters
at their most vulnerable</i>

1888
01:34:26.708 --> 01:34:27.709
<i>with each other.</i>

1889
01:34:28.343 --> 01:34:31.613
<i>Neo tells Trinity
that he's afraid of losing her.</i>

1890
01:34:32.014 --> 01:34:36.018
<i>And she says.
"You're not gonna lose me."</i>

1891
01:34:36.385 --> 01:34:38.620
<i>She holds his hand.
"You feel this?"</i>

1892
01:34:40.255 --> 01:34:41.990
<i>"I'm never letting go."</i>

1893
01:34:42.658 --> 01:34:43.692
<i>That's love.</i>

1894
01:34:44.359 --> 01:34:46.728
<i>You have to be
very vulnerable to feel it.</i>

1895
01:34:47.763 --> 01:34:51.200
I think loneliness
and isolation and trauma

1896
01:34:51.333 --> 01:34:53.635
play very heavily
in the kinds of realities

1897
01:34:53.769 --> 01:34:56.071
that people construct
for themselves.

1898
01:35:00.776 --> 01:35:02.478
<i>And if there's a player</i>

1899
01:35:02.611 --> 01:35:05.314
<i>that is responsible for me
and is playing me...</i>

1900
01:35:06.615 --> 01:35:09.919
then. you know.
maybe he's a genius.

1901
01:35:10.118 --> 01:35:11.987
but maybe he's like
a 12-year-old kid.

1902
01:35:13.689 --> 01:35:16.992
<i>So the thing I've gotta do
is I've gotta keep leveling up</i>

1903
01:35:17.259 --> 01:35:19.394
<i>and I've gotta stay interesting
for him.</i>

1904
01:35:20.128 --> 01:35:22.698
<i>Do you make different
choices than you might</i>

1905
01:35:22.832 --> 01:35:25.434
<i>otherwise in order to keep
your player interested?</i>

1906
01:35:25.734 --> 01:35:27.236
The way I think about is.
you know.

1907
01:35:27.369 --> 01:35:28.604
if you're playing a video game

1908
01:35:28.938 --> 01:35:31.240
and sometimes you see
like a giant blinking cursor

1909
01:35:31.373 --> 01:35:32.774
telling you to go
to a certain place.

1910
01:35:32.909 --> 01:35:34.510
I keep looking for those.

1911
01:35:34.643 --> 01:35:37.312
And when I see one. I'll stop
and I'll pause and I'll say...

1912
01:35:37.847 --> 01:35:40.282
"Thank you for that."
and I'll. you know...

1913
01:35:40.449 --> 01:35:41.784
And then every once in a while.

1914
01:35:41.918 --> 01:35:43.285
I'll just make a completely
batshit decision

1915
01:35:43.418 --> 01:35:45.153
that no one seems to understand.

1916
01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:47.155
Including myself!
Like. "Well. well. well!"

1917
01:35:47.289 --> 01:35:48.390
I hope you're interested.

1918
01:35:48.524 --> 01:35:49.792
Just like
all the other theories.

1919
01:35:49.926 --> 01:35:52.728
no one's gonna know
until they're dead.

1920
01:35:54.696 --> 01:35:57.332
<i>And I don't believe
that it's flawed enough</i>

1921
01:35:57.466 --> 01:35:59.201
<i>that it could somehow tear...</i>

1922
01:35:59.836 --> 01:36:04.039
<i>and we'd find ourselves exposed</i>
<i>out of</i> The Matrix.

1923
01:36:04.506 --> 01:36:05.942
<i>I don't think
that's how it works.</i>

1924
01:36:06.074 --> 01:36:08.310
I think that
it's a solid system.

1925
01:36:08.443 --> 01:36:11.046
And whatever it is.
ends when you die.

1926
01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:14.516
<i>But it's totally plausible
that you then wake up</i>

1927
01:36:14.884 --> 01:36:18.487
<i>in an arcade in the year 3000
and put another quarter in</i>

1928
01:36:18.620 --> 01:36:21.423
<i>and do another life on Earth
in the year 2019. you know?</i>

1929
01:36:21.657 --> 01:36:23.960
There are these kind of
fundamental metaphors

1930
01:36:24.092 --> 01:36:28.664
about reality that we develop
through being humans

1931
01:36:28.798 --> 01:36:31.667
moving through time and space
on a planet.

1932
01:36:31.868 --> 01:36:35.671
So the metaphor of the journey.
"Life is like a journey."

1933
01:36:35.905 --> 01:36:38.674
Well. another one we have.
and we all have it is.

1934
01:36:38.942 --> 01:36:41.577
waking up from a dream.

1935
01:36:44.246 --> 01:36:47.516
"What? Oh. I'm in this world!"

1936
01:36:47.716 --> 01:36:51.821
<i>And just that. Not what
the nature of this world was.</i>

1937
01:36:51.955 --> 01:36:53.322
<i>or the nature of that world is.</i>

1938
01:36:53.555 --> 01:36:56.391
<i>We have this fundamental
cognitive experience</i>

1939
01:36:57.125 --> 01:36:59.862
<i>of shifting between
ontological frames.</i>

1940
01:36:59.996 --> 01:37:01.463
<i>sometimes quite abruptly.</i>

1941
01:37:01.630 --> 01:37:03.365
<i>Sometimes with
intense emotions.</i>

1942
01:37:03.632 --> 01:37:05.267
And this is just
stitched into us.

1943
01:37:05.802 --> 01:37:09.738
So it's a fundamental hunch
that we all have

1944
01:37:10.238 --> 01:37:12.474
<i>that the world
is not what it seems.</i>

1945
01:37:12.641 --> 01:37:14.242
<i>There's another world
behind this world.</i>

1946
01:37:14.376 --> 01:37:15.812
<i>or at the very least.</i>

1947
01:37:16.144 --> 01:37:18.982
<i>this world is capable
of falling apart.</i>

1948
01:37:19.114 --> 01:37:20.850
- What's happening?
- Nothing.

1949
01:37:21.516 --> 01:37:22.819
<i>I don't know.
does thinking about</i>

1950
01:37:22.952 --> 01:37:24.586
<i>the simulation.
does that excite you?</i>

1951
01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:28.423
<i>Or does it sometimes
fill you with unease?</i>

1952
01:37:33.062 --> 01:37:34.229
Well. I guess...

1953
01:37:36.065 --> 01:37:39.735
I've had
this simulation argument

1954
01:37:39.869 --> 01:37:43.138
for so long now
that it's hard to sort of

1955
01:37:43.639 --> 01:37:45.140
consider the counter faction.

1956
01:37:45.374 --> 01:37:47.142
'Cause it's kind of become
so much a part of

1957
01:37:47.643 --> 01:37:49.946
the way I view the world.

1958
01:37:50.079 --> 01:37:51.179
the simulation argument.

1959
01:37:53.883 --> 01:37:54.851
I do think that...

1960
01:37:57.352 --> 01:38:00.790
it makes it quite...

1961
01:38:04.192 --> 01:38:05.460
compelling that

1962
01:38:05.862 --> 01:38:09.431
this very general notion.
that there are more things...

1963
01:38:12.035 --> 01:38:13.168
<i>in heaven and on earth</i>

1964
01:38:13.803 --> 01:38:15.905
<i>than are dreamt of
in our philosophy.</i>

1965
01:38:16.072 --> 01:38:20.275
<i>This sense that we are
plausibly very. very limited</i>

1966
01:38:21.044 --> 01:38:23.645
<i>in our understanding
of what the heck is going on.</i>

1967
01:38:25.148 --> 01:38:28.350
We have made progress in that
maybe we have figured out.

1968
01:38:29.085 --> 01:38:31.620
you know. six of the 10 things
you need to have figured out

1969
01:38:31.753 --> 01:38:33.221
to really know what's going on.

1970
01:38:33.588 --> 01:38:36.159
But the thing is that each
of the remaining four things

1971
01:38:36.725 --> 01:38:38.861
might so radically
change the conclusions

1972
01:38:39.896 --> 01:38:41.430
that.
until we get them all right.

1973
01:38:41.563 --> 01:38:43.231
maybe we are as lost

1974
01:38:43.365 --> 01:38:46.234
as you would be if you only knew
one or zero.

1975
01:38:55.677 --> 01:38:57.279
<i>I was lying in bed.
I was thinking about it.</i>

1976
01:38:57.412 --> 01:38:58.747
<i>So hypothetically.</i>

1977
01:38:58.881 --> 01:39:01.416
<i>what if tomorrow
I dress in all white</i>

1978
01:39:01.550 --> 01:39:03.452
<i>I slick my hair back.
and I'm like. "Hey."</i>

1979
01:39:03.618 --> 01:39:05.253
<i>I tell the local media.</i>

1980
01:39:05.888 --> 01:39:08.457
<i>"Here's the message that we
should be good to each other.</i>

1981
01:39:08.590 --> 01:39:10.258
<i>I'm starting a new thing."</i>

1982
01:39:10.860 --> 01:39:12.728
<i>Building up almost
like a religion.</i>

1983
01:39:12.862 --> 01:39:14.396
<i>or just more of
a philosophy of.</i>

1984
01:39:14.529 --> 01:39:15.865
<i>"Hey. we are in a simulation.</i>

1985
01:39:16.132 --> 01:39:19.701
<i>so let's. let's try and gain
the attention of those people."</i>

1986
01:39:20.569 --> 01:39:22.404
Now. those entities
are running the thing.

1987
01:39:23.005 --> 01:39:25.373
So going forth here.
we could do things like.

1988
01:39:25.908 --> 01:39:28.710
<i>you know. gigantic light.
like...</i>

1989
01:39:30.146 --> 01:39:31.914
<i>simultaneous light displays.</i>

1990
01:39:33.715 --> 01:39:36.953
<i>giant monuments.
just a giant tablet that says.</i>

1991
01:39:37.086 --> 01:39:40.455
<i>"Hey. we know..."
or something profound.</i>

1992
01:39:41.224 --> 01:39:44.526
<i>And then in unison
just flashing lights out.</i>

1993
01:39:44.659 --> 01:39:47.395
<i>So. one person walks
by this black sphere</i>

1994
01:39:47.529 --> 01:39:50.800
<i>in their great
artificer hallway</i>

1995
01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.835
<i>and all of a sudden there's
a red light blinking</i>

1996
01:39:52.969 --> 01:39:54.937
<i>that was never there before.
They'd be like. "Oh. hey.</i>

1997
01:39:56.239 --> 01:39:59.374
<i>Experiment whatever
is talking to us."</i>

1998
01:39:59.976 --> 01:40:02.544
I mean. who knows.
if we just keep going with it

1999
01:40:02.677 --> 01:40:04.180
and going with it
and going with it.

2000
01:40:04.346 --> 01:40:09.786
Do things like organize Earth
in a more watchful pattern

2001
01:40:09.919 --> 01:40:11.586
to get ourselves
spread over the universe.

2002
01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:14.257
'Cause the larger screen
we have to display our message.

2003
01:40:14.389 --> 01:40:16.291
the more attention we'll get.

2004
01:40:20.797 --> 01:40:21.898
<i>You're dreaming.</i>

2005
01:40:23.166 --> 01:40:25.734
Doug. was it about Mars?

2006
01:40:30.505 --> 01:40:32.074
<i>Becoming a multi-planet species</i>

2007
01:40:32.809 --> 01:40:35.510
beats the hell out of being
a single-planet species.

2008
01:40:36.411 --> 01:40:37.546
<i>Then we get to. like...</i>

2009
01:40:38.114 --> 01:40:40.850
Star Wars <i>levels</i>
<i>of spread across the galaxy.</i>

2010
01:40:41.117 --> 01:40:43.019
Perhaps our science
will progress enough

2011
01:40:43.186 --> 01:40:44.153
<i>where we can actually</i>

2012
01:40:44.486 --> 01:40:46.555
<i>tap on the membrane between...</i>

2013
01:40:47.223 --> 01:40:50.293
<i>the universe
and what's beyond it</i>

2014
01:40:50.492 --> 01:40:51.828
<i>and perhaps get a message out.</i>

2015
01:40:51.961 --> 01:40:54.696
<i>an active message
to an active listener.</i>

2016
01:40:55.064 --> 01:40:56.799
<i>I don't like to fuss or moan.</i>

2017
01:40:56.933 --> 01:40:58.935
<i>but if it weren't for you.</i>

2018
01:40:59.401 --> 01:41:00.837
<i>I'd be all. all alone.</i>

2019
01:41:01.871 --> 01:41:03.672
It would be hilarious
if we were something stupid.

2020
01:41:03.806 --> 01:41:05.640
like. you know how computers
are in everything.

2021
01:41:07.310 --> 01:41:10.913
I mean. there's a computer...
this is a vape tank.

2022
01:41:11.180 --> 01:41:13.983
There's a computer in here.
There's a microchip in here.

2023
01:41:14.416 --> 01:41:15.885
But if we're something like...

2024
01:41:16.953 --> 01:41:18.420
one of the numerous
computer devices

2025
01:41:18.553 --> 01:41:21.423
that's been thrown
into a basket somewhere

2026
01:41:21.656 --> 01:41:22.792
<i>'cause you have too much crap.</i>

2027
01:41:23.391 --> 01:41:25.228
<i>That would suck. 'cause then
we would never be found.</i>

2028
01:41:25.995 --> 01:41:29.397
Maybe this whole project
that you're doing. right.

2029
01:41:29.799 --> 01:41:33.635
is the simulation sort of
flirting with you. if you will.

2030
01:41:33.768 --> 01:41:36.172
Like it's going.
"Hey. I'm gonna go ahead

2031
01:41:36.305 --> 01:41:37.672
and let you see a little bit

2032
01:41:38.573 --> 01:41:40.076
what I've got going on
under here.

2033
01:41:40.276 --> 01:41:44.446
And I'm okay with it
as long as you respect me."

2034
01:41:46.916 --> 01:41:50.786
<i>What if the simulation
is like anesthesia?</i>

2035
01:41:51.486 --> 01:41:53.122
<i>Imagine. if you will.</i>

2036
01:41:53.622 --> 01:41:56.025
<i>that you're going
through surgery...</i>

2037
01:41:57.360 --> 01:41:58.760
<i>and all of a sudden somebody</i>

2038
01:41:58.895 --> 01:41:59.728
<i>introduces something
in your bloodstream</i>

2039
01:41:59.862 --> 01:42:01.663
<i>that totally makes</i>

2040
01:42:01.797 --> 01:42:04.200
<i>the anesthetic go away.</i>

2041
01:42:04.333 --> 01:42:05.700
<i>Your chest cavity's open.</i>

2042
01:42:05.835 --> 01:42:07.169
<i>there's somebody
with their hand in it</i>

2043
01:42:07.303 --> 01:42:08.905
<i>and they're trying
to massage your heart.</i>

2044
01:42:09.038 --> 01:42:10.806
<i>And all of a sudden
you're back. lucid.</i>

2045
01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:13.042
<i>all the pain in the world.
and everything like that.</i>

2046
01:42:13.209 --> 01:42:14.676
<i>You're gonna mess up
that surgery</i>

2047
01:42:14.810 --> 01:42:16.012
<i>by freaking out
and flipping around</i>

2048
01:42:16.145 --> 01:42:17.346
<i>and all that.</i>

2049
01:42:17.479 --> 01:42:18.915
Maybe that's what
the simulation is.

2050
01:42:19.048 --> 01:42:21.516
<i>And by putting
this project out there.</i>

2051
01:42:21.951 --> 01:42:23.819
<i>we're messing up big time</i>

2052
01:42:24.186 --> 01:42:25.955
<i>and you're gonna cause
a lot of damage.</i>

2053
01:42:30.326 --> 01:42:31.593
<i>The other option. though.</i>

2054
01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:36.165
maybe this is the...
the key. if you will.

2055
01:42:36.832 --> 01:42:40.769
Maybe this is a situation
where the simulation is bad.

2056
01:42:41.304 --> 01:42:45.141
we shouldn't be in it.
and this is a failsafe.

2057
01:42:49.245 --> 01:42:51.080
<i>So the person watching
this goes.</i>

2058
01:42:51.314 --> 01:42:53.916
<i>"Oh. maybe that's
what's happening with me."</i>

2059
01:42:55.717 --> 01:42:57.519
<i>And maybe. who knows.
you know.</i>

2060
01:42:57.652 --> 01:43:01.290
<i>they're in
suspended animation somewhere.</i>

2061
01:43:02.358 --> 01:43:03.725
<i>They're the ones
who are supposed</i>

2062
01:43:03.893 --> 01:43:05.227
<i>to pilot the ship.</i>

2063
01:43:05.428 --> 01:43:07.729
<i>They're knocked out.
They're not responsive.</i>

2064
01:43:08.130 --> 01:43:12.268
<i>And so they create this movie
for them to watch</i>

2065
01:43:12.401 --> 01:43:14.904
<i>so that they start
questioning reality.</i>

2066
01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:19.075
<i>and therefore get out of it.</i>

2067
01:43:57.913 --> 01:44:01.183
I have.
through dreaming and waking up.

2068
01:44:01.516 --> 01:44:03.518
lived thousands
of different lifetimes.

2069
01:44:04.020 --> 01:44:07.456
And so I'm not afraid
of what happens

2070
01:44:07.589 --> 01:44:09.091
when the simulation ends.

2071
01:44:09.458 --> 01:44:14.463
I am certain that when I die.

2072
01:44:14.596 --> 01:44:16.032
I will simply wake up
somewhere else.

2073
01:44:16.165 --> 01:44:18.467
How do I know?
Because I remember doing it

2074
01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:19.902
over and over and over again.

2075
01:44:28.710 --> 01:44:30.346
<i>Good morning.</i>

2076
01:44:30.578 --> 01:44:31.780
<i>This is your wake-up call.</i>

2077
01:44:32.281 --> 01:44:34.549
<i>Thank you for staying
at the New Darwin Inn.</i>

2078
01:44:34.917 --> 01:44:37.219
<i>The time is 10:30 A.M.</i>
