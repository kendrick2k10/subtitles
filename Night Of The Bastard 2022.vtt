- I don't know. George.
You tell me.

182
00:15:24.619 --> 00:15:26.490
You'’re the one who
told that fucker we'’d leave.

183
00:15:26.534 --> 00:15:28.928
- Yeah. you caved to
that asshole so fast.

184
00:15:28.971 --> 00:15:30.755
We could'’ve taken him.
- Fuck you both.

185
00:15:30.799 --> 00:15:32.888
I'’m not about to argue
with some trigger happy local.

186
00:15:34.542 --> 00:15:35.673
[gun clicking]

187
00:15:56.868 --> 00:15:58.958
- Hold up.
What the fuck is that?

188
00:16:00.829 --> 00:16:02.135
- Shut up for a second!

189
00:16:05.616 --> 00:16:07.357
- I don'’t know about this. guys.

190
00:16:07.923 --> 00:16:09.664
What in the fuck are they doing?

191
00:16:10.186 --> 00:16:12.232
- It looks like some
new agey Wiccan shit.

192
00:16:13.059 --> 00:16:16.801
- Whoa.
looks like my kind of party!

193
00:16:16.845 --> 00:16:17.889
Let'’s go!

194
00:16:17.933 --> 00:16:19.848
- Wait. you perv.

195
00:16:20.892 --> 00:16:22.285
What do you think. George?

196
00:16:22.546 --> 00:16:23.895
- I could use a break
from lugging this shit

197
00:16:23.939 --> 00:16:25.027
around in the dark.

198
00:16:25.071 --> 00:16:26.420
- Yeah. come on.

199
00:16:26.463 --> 00:16:28.030
Let'’s check out the freak show!

200
00:16:53.882 --> 00:16:55.144
- Hey guys!

201
00:16:59.453 --> 00:17:00.932
We'’re out here
camping tonight too.

202
00:17:00.976 --> 00:17:04.327
and wondering if we could
maybe join you for a while.

203
00:17:05.067 --> 00:17:07.635
- What are you doing?
Get out of here!

204
00:17:07.678 --> 00:17:12.422
- Mason. Mason. we shouldn'’t be
so unfriendly to our guests.

205
00:17:12.466 --> 00:17:14.033
Come join us. Please.

206
00:17:14.729 --> 00:17:16.644
- It'’s okay. We can go.

207
00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:20.082
- No. no. please.
Forgive brother Mason here.

208
00:17:20.126 --> 00:17:22.084
He can be quite
abrasive at times.

209
00:17:22.128 --> 00:17:23.216
but no. he means no harm.

210
00:17:23.259 --> 00:17:24.826
Come. have a seat
next to our fire.

211
00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:26.001
You must be cold.

212
00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:27.481
- I'’m warming up already.

213
00:17:29.135 --> 00:17:31.224
- So what are you all
doing out here?

214
00:17:31.267 --> 00:17:33.182
Some sort of nature worship?

215
00:17:33.226 --> 00:17:34.575
- You could say that.

216
00:17:34.618 --> 00:17:36.968
- Call it a warm up
before the main attraction.

217
00:17:38.709 --> 00:17:40.668
Where did you say
you were camping tonight?

218
00:17:40.972 --> 00:17:42.278
- We didn'’t say.

219
00:17:42.322 --> 00:17:43.975
- We had a spot over that way

220
00:17:44.019 --> 00:17:47.544
but some creep came in
and chased us out.

221
00:17:47.892 --> 00:17:49.111
He came out with
a shot gun.

222
00:17:49.155 --> 00:17:50.547
- A shotgun?

223
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:53.072
Well. we despise guns.

224
00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:54.769
[spits]

225
00:17:55.117 --> 00:17:58.207
If you'’re going to kill.
do it up close and personal.

226
00:18:00.557 --> 00:18:02.081
Or don'’t do it at all.

227
00:18:02.516 --> 00:18:03.908
Don't you agree?

228
00:18:04.344 --> 00:18:06.302
- Uh. yeah. Sounds reasonable.

229
00:18:06.694 --> 00:18:08.826
- You guys don'’t look
like you'’re camping.

230
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:10.263
- And why do you say that?

231
00:18:10.306 --> 00:18:11.438
- Where'’s your gear?

232
00:18:11.481 --> 00:18:13.353
- We already have
everything we need.

233
00:18:14.354 --> 00:18:15.920
Is it just the three
of you tonight?

234
00:18:16.486 --> 00:18:18.793
Mm. how quaint.

235
00:18:27.715 --> 00:18:31.849
A handsome young trio
creepy crawling the desert.

236
00:18:31.893 --> 00:18:34.330
disturbing not only
gun-toting locals

237
00:18:34.374 --> 00:18:37.159
but powerful
necromancers as well.

238
00:18:37.203 --> 00:18:40.423
- Yeah. That'’s. um. us.

239
00:18:41.294 --> 00:18:43.513
- Yeah. We were kinda
hoping you guys had beers.

240
00:18:43.557 --> 00:18:45.994
- Such worldly intoxicants
pale in comparison

241
00:18:46.037 --> 00:18:48.170
to the highs
we achieve naturally.

242
00:18:53.828 --> 00:18:56.744
Breathe in the air.
witness the stars aligning.

243
00:19:05.448 --> 00:19:06.710
- Pete!

244
00:19:20.811 --> 00:19:22.378
- That'’s enough for you tonight.

245
00:19:22.422 --> 00:19:24.467
- Come on. baby.
The night'’s still young.

246
00:19:24.511 --> 00:19:25.816
We got plenty of time.

247
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:27.514
- Not for you.

248
00:19:27.688 --> 00:19:28.950
Swine!

249
00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:31.257
Filthy pig!

250
00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.998
My altar is sacred.
not for your pleasures

251
00:19:34.042 --> 00:19:35.957
but for the assumption
of a deity!

252
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.480
- What the hell. lady? Relax.

253
00:19:37.524 --> 00:19:38.612
You were practically throwing

254
00:19:38.655 --> 00:19:40.135
your witchy vag at me
a second ago.

255
00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:43.138
- Like pigs. you gorge on
the filth that infects you.

256
00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:46.097
I see the mirage
of your entitlement.

257
00:19:46.141 --> 00:19:48.404
But between your
sorry skin and bones

258
00:19:48.448 --> 00:19:52.495
rests an empty vessel for the
magnificent curios we conjure.

259
00:19:52.539 --> 00:19:54.715
- What the fuck
are you talking about. lady?

260
00:19:56.325 --> 00:19:57.848
- Are you one of them.

261
00:19:57.892 --> 00:19:59.981
the pathetic hoard
who waste their lives

262
00:20:00.024 --> 00:20:02.244
simply waiting to die?

263
00:20:02.288 --> 00:20:05.595
Or are you ready to discover
your true purpose?

264
00:20:05.639 --> 00:20:09.295
I asked. are you ready?
- Ready for what?

265
00:20:09.338 --> 00:20:11.471
- Have you ever wanted
to be immortal?

266
00:20:11.514 --> 00:20:12.646
- I don't know.

267
00:20:12.689 --> 00:20:13.908
I'’ve never really
thought about it.

268
00:20:13.951 --> 00:20:16.127
- Ready or not.

269
00:20:16.171 --> 00:20:19.261
your offering will bring forth
the coming of the Great Prince.

270
00:20:19.305 --> 00:20:21.959
- Man. fuck this shit yo!

271
00:20:22.003 --> 00:20:23.222
Let's go.

272
00:20:24.527 --> 00:20:25.920
- [Kiera screams]

273
00:20:28.314 --> 00:20:31.012
- [screaming]
- [laughing]

274
00:20:34.668 --> 00:20:35.930
- Steady. my brethren.

275
00:20:35.973 --> 00:20:37.888
I want to enjoy this
euphoric moment.

276
00:20:37.932 --> 00:20:38.976
- Please let me go.

277
00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:40.456
I won'’t say anything to anyone!

278
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.110
- There'’s nothing
for you to say.

279
00:20:42.153 --> 00:20:43.677
- Why are you doing this?

280
00:20:44.765 --> 00:20:48.116
- Some events are not meant
for your kind to understand.

281
00:20:48.159 --> 00:20:51.293
Tonight you shall transcend
this meaningless realm.

282
00:20:51.337 --> 00:20:52.947
You're welcome.

283
00:20:53.077 --> 00:20:56.080
- Please.
I just want to go home!

284
00:20:56.124 --> 00:20:57.865
I just want to go...

285
00:20:57.908 --> 00:21:00.171
[muffled screaming]

286
00:21:17.885 --> 00:21:20.148
- Let me go you fucking psychos!

287
00:21:20.191 --> 00:21:22.193
[screams]

288
00:21:30.941 --> 00:21:32.291
- Where'’s the girl?

289
00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:35.032
- Fuck!

290
00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.996
- I think I know where
she went. Priestess.

291
00:21:44.041 --> 00:21:45.782
[laughs]

292
00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:55.488
- [crying]

293
00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.280
- Hey. little buddy.

294
00:22:07.369 --> 00:22:08.979
Bedtime.

295
00:22:09.632 --> 00:22:11.895
- [crying]

296
00:22:12.331 --> 00:22:15.812
- Marlon. you can'’t be
hungry this late.

297
00:22:19.773 --> 00:22:21.644
- [crying contiues]

298
00:22:23.429 --> 00:22:26.475
Ok. just a little bit.

299
00:22:29.173 --> 00:22:31.045
[knocking on door]

300
00:22:31.959 --> 00:22:33.177
Nobody'’s home!

301
00:22:33.569 --> 00:22:35.179
[knocking on door]

302
00:22:40.924 --> 00:22:41.838
You again!

303
00:22:41.969 --> 00:22:44.754
I got deeds to all this land.

304
00:22:44.798 --> 00:22:46.321
Go ahead. Sue me.

305
00:22:46.365 --> 00:22:48.149
- Please! Mister!
Please! I need help!

306
00:22:48.192 --> 00:22:49.672
- Move your foot.

307
00:22:49.716 --> 00:22:51.195
I don'’t care who your
son-of-a-bitch boyfriend knows.

308
00:22:51.239 --> 00:22:52.240
Get the hell outta here.

309
00:22:52.283 --> 00:22:53.763
- Please. mister. help me!

310
00:22:53.807 --> 00:22:55.591
Don'’t leave me out here!
They tried to kill me!

311
00:22:55.635 --> 00:22:57.201
- Well you deserved it.

312
00:22:57.245 --> 00:22:58.768
Take your business elsewhere.

313
00:22:58.812 --> 00:23:00.466
You want me to get my gun again?

314
00:23:00.509 --> 00:23:02.555
- No! I'’ll die out here!

315
00:23:02.598 --> 00:23:06.080
Please! Please!
Just let me use your phone!

316
00:23:06.123 --> 00:23:07.734
- Are you deaf or crazy?

317
00:23:07.777 --> 00:23:09.997
You think I'm falling
for this bullshit?

318
00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.607
Move your foot
before I break it off!

319
00:23:11.651 --> 00:23:12.956
- No! No!

320
00:23:17.134 --> 00:23:18.962
[screams in pain]

321
00:23:20.399 --> 00:23:21.965
- For Christ's sake. lady!

322
00:23:25.665 --> 00:23:27.101
[door thuds]

323
00:23:28.145 --> 00:23:29.582
Oh shit.

324
00:23:31.758 --> 00:23:34.238
- Please. call the police!

325
00:23:34.282 --> 00:23:35.849
They'’re still out there!

326
00:23:36.937 --> 00:23:39.287
- You must have really pissed
off your fuck faced boyfriends.

327
00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:42.246
- No. we were attacked!

328
00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:44.335
- What? By who?

329
00:23:45.119 --> 00:23:47.077
- By these freaks in the desert!

330
00:23:47.121 --> 00:23:49.166
We were looking for
another place to camp.

331
00:23:50.646 --> 00:23:51.952
- They stabbed you?

332
00:23:51.995 --> 00:23:53.910
- Yes. genius.

333
00:23:54.694 --> 00:23:56.435
[screams]

334
00:23:59.307 --> 00:24:00.613
- Here.

335
00:24:02.528 --> 00:24:05.487
- What am I
supposed to do with this?

336
00:24:05.531 --> 00:24:06.836
- Wrap yourself.

337
00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.359
It'’ll slow the bleeding.

338
00:24:12.538 --> 00:24:14.148
- [screams in pain]

339
00:24:36.083 --> 00:24:38.389
[panting]

340
00:24:40.261 --> 00:24:41.654
- I don'’t need this hassle.

341
00:24:42.393 --> 00:24:44.134
You gotta get
out of here right now.

342
00:24:45.571 --> 00:24:48.617
- I'’m sorry to disturb your
perfect fucking evening.

343
00:24:48.661 --> 00:24:50.184
Where would you like me to go?

344
00:24:51.359 --> 00:24:53.579
- You could go anywhere
but here.

345
00:24:55.015 --> 00:24:57.104
- Fine. then at least let me
at least use your phone

346
00:24:57.147 --> 00:24:58.409
to call the police.

347
00:24:58.453 --> 00:25:00.237
- I don'’t have a phone.

348
00:25:00.281 --> 00:25:02.196
- What do you mean
you don'’t have a phone?!

349
00:25:02.239 --> 00:25:03.719
- Just what I said.

350
00:25:03.763 --> 00:25:06.287
I don'’t talk to anybody
and that's the way I like it.

351
00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:07.810
- Great.

352
00:25:07.854 --> 00:25:09.072
So you'’re like the last
person on this fucking planet

353
00:25:09.116 --> 00:25:10.509
who doesn't have a phone?

354
00:25:10.552 --> 00:25:14.338
People in jungle shacks
have phones and you don'’t?

355
00:25:14.382 --> 00:25:15.731
- So where'’s yours. lady?

356
00:25:15.775 --> 00:25:17.559
- I lost it while running here!

357
00:25:23.609 --> 00:25:28.004
Look man. this is the
last place I want to be.

358
00:25:28.048 --> 00:25:31.486
but I obviously need a hospital.

359
00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:34.533
- Alright.

360
00:25:35.577 --> 00:25:37.753
There'’s a clinic about
10 miles up the interstate.

361
00:25:39.625 --> 00:25:41.409
I'll take you there.

362
00:25:45.761 --> 00:25:47.197
- I don'’t think I can get up.

363
00:25:48.634 --> 00:25:49.939
Help me.

364
00:25:52.115 --> 00:25:53.900
[screaming in pain]

365
00:25:56.119 --> 00:25:57.817
You have any painkillers
or something?

366
00:26:00.515 --> 00:26:01.690
- No.

367
00:26:02.517 --> 00:26:04.040
- C'mon on. man.

368
00:26:04.084 --> 00:26:06.434
You live all the way out here
in the middle of bum fuck

369
00:26:06.477 --> 00:26:07.870
and you don'’t have any drugs?!

370
00:26:07.914 --> 00:26:09.698
- Yes. I mean no.

371
00:26:11.352 --> 00:26:12.919
- I hate my life...

372
00:26:37.726 --> 00:26:39.032
- Drink that.

373
00:26:45.473 --> 00:26:46.735
- What is this?

374
00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:48.258
- Does it matter?

375
00:26:53.655 --> 00:26:55.570
- [coughing]

376
00:26:55.614 --> 00:26:57.485
What the fuck is that?

377
00:26:57.528 --> 00:26:58.660
- It's mead.

378
00:26:59.008 --> 00:27:01.271
It's wine made from honey and--
- I know what mead is.

379
00:27:01.315 --> 00:27:02.882
But that'’s shit mead.

380
00:27:02.925 --> 00:27:04.448
- It needs some work. I guess.

381
00:27:04.492 --> 00:27:05.841
- No shit.

382
00:27:05.885 --> 00:27:08.104
God. that'’s strong
and disgusting!

383
00:27:10.063 --> 00:27:10.933
- Fine.

384
00:27:10.977 --> 00:27:12.848
- No. Wait. give me some more.

385
00:27:18.898 --> 00:27:21.552
[retching]

386
00:27:31.824 --> 00:27:35.392
- Whenever you're finished
drinking my shitty mead.

387
00:27:35.436 --> 00:27:36.916
you gotta get out of here.

388
00:27:43.836 --> 00:27:45.315
C'mon. Let's go.

389
00:27:48.579 --> 00:27:50.669
- [groaning]

390
00:27:56.631 --> 00:27:57.588
Wait.

391
00:27:57.632 --> 00:27:59.155
What if they'’re out there?

392
00:28:07.511 --> 00:28:09.731
[bottles clinking]

393
00:28:16.433 --> 00:28:18.740
[distant chanting]

394
00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:21.090
Do you hear that?

395
00:28:22.701 --> 00:28:24.093
That'’s them.

396
00:28:26.052 --> 00:28:27.836
[chanting continues]

397
00:28:29.969 --> 00:28:30.839
[screams]

398
00:28:40.631 --> 00:28:41.850
Oh my god!

399
00:28:41.894 --> 00:28:42.764
- Is that them?

400
00:28:42.808 --> 00:28:44.157
- What do you think?!

401
00:28:47.813 --> 00:28:48.988
What are they doing?

402
00:28:49.031 --> 00:28:50.250
- I can'’t see 'em.

403
00:28:51.468 --> 00:28:52.600
But we're OK.

404
00:28:52.643 --> 00:28:54.645
Doors. windows
double locked and barred.

405
00:28:54.689 --> 00:28:55.951
We're good.

406
00:28:55.995 --> 00:28:57.518
- Great. So we're
basically trapped in here.

407
00:28:57.561 --> 00:28:59.389
You know we're have to get
out of here eventually. right?

408
00:28:59.433 --> 00:29:00.826
- Yeah. No shit.

409
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:04.699
What do they want?

410
00:29:04.743 --> 00:29:07.093
- I don'’t know. man.
To finish the job?

411
00:29:07.136 --> 00:29:08.485
- Why the hell
did you come here?

412
00:29:08.529 --> 00:29:09.660
- What else is around here?

413
00:29:09.704 --> 00:29:11.358
I didn'’t know
this was your house!

414
00:29:11.401 --> 00:29:12.881
- Do you know how many
of them are there?

415
00:29:12.925 --> 00:29:15.536
- I don't know. man.
Five or six maybe?

416
00:29:18.974 --> 00:29:20.236
- Did you see any guns?

417
00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.021
- No. They don't have any.

418
00:29:22.064 --> 00:29:23.762
Their queen bitch hates them.

419
00:29:24.458 --> 00:29:26.677
Hey. Hey. where'’s your gun?

420
00:29:26.721 --> 00:29:27.809
- In the shed.

421
00:29:27.853 --> 00:29:29.158
- What do you mean
it's in the shed?

422
00:29:30.116 --> 00:29:32.814
- Trust me.
It'’s better out there.

423
00:29:32.858 --> 00:29:34.468
- Better how?

424
00:29:34.511 --> 00:29:36.296
Not only are you the last person
on Earth without a fucking phone

425
00:29:36.339 --> 00:29:38.124
but you also keep
your guns in the shed.

426
00:29:38.167 --> 00:29:40.126
What kind of home
security is that?

427
00:29:40.169 --> 00:29:42.650
What the fuck is your problem?

428
00:29:42.693 --> 00:29:44.434
- I keep it out there

429
00:29:44.478 --> 00:29:46.480
so I don'’t use it
on myself in here.

430
00:29:46.523 --> 00:29:49.613
If we can hold on for
a couple hours

431
00:29:49.657 --> 00:29:51.572
maybe they'll scatter
in the morning.

432
00:29:54.793 --> 00:29:56.664
We got six hours 'till sunrise.

433
00:29:56.707 --> 00:29:58.884
- Great. I could die by then.

434
00:29:58.927 --> 00:30:01.016
- You'’ve made it this far.
- And?

435
00:30:01.451 --> 00:30:04.977
- Like I said.
iron bars. metal screens.

436
00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:06.152
They ain't getting in here.

437
00:30:06.195 --> 00:30:08.415
- Are you sure about that?

438
00:30:12.506 --> 00:30:14.813
I still need a hospital.

439
00:30:16.684 --> 00:30:19.513
[flares crackling]

440
00:30:30.219 --> 00:30:32.178
- Good evening. friends!

441
00:30:32.221 --> 00:30:34.267
It seems we'’ve gotten off
on the wrong foot.

442
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:35.877
- Tell that to the cops!

443
00:30:35.921 --> 00:30:38.445
- Do as I ask and you can
tell them yourselves.

444
00:30:38.488 --> 00:30:40.360
- What in the hell do you want?!

445
00:30:40.403 --> 00:30:42.231
- We could start with her first.

446
00:30:42.884 --> 00:30:45.060
Time is on our side.
and the longer this takes.

447
00:30:45.104 --> 00:30:46.801
the worse it will be
for you both.

448
00:30:47.889 --> 00:30:50.979
Open the door now and we
promise to show you mercy.

449
00:30:51.023 --> 00:30:54.113
- If you don'’t get off
my land right now

450
00:30:54.156 --> 00:30:56.942
I'’m gonna murder
every single one of you!

451
00:30:56.985 --> 00:30:58.378
- I sincerely doubt that.

452
00:30:58.421 --> 00:31:00.597
As you can see.
we have you surrounded.

453
00:31:03.905 --> 00:31:07.517
- Take your boys go get fucked.

454
00:31:07.561 --> 00:31:09.041
- In due time.

455
00:31:09.084 --> 00:31:11.304
But first.
let'’s have some fun. shall we?

456
00:31:13.045 --> 00:31:15.264
You have walls
and bars to protect you.

457
00:31:15.308 --> 00:31:17.092
but we have the advantage.

458
00:31:19.312 --> 00:31:21.444
- Let's smoke 'em out.
- Patience. Earl.

459
00:31:21.488 --> 00:31:23.533
They'’ll come to us
when we need them.

460
00:31:27.886 --> 00:31:29.365
- Fuck.

461
00:31:30.323 --> 00:31:31.411
- I changed my mind.

462
00:31:31.454 --> 00:31:33.456
You're not gonna
last long like that.

463
00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:34.936
- What can we do?

464
00:31:38.548 --> 00:31:40.028
What am I supposed
to do with that?

465
00:31:40.072 --> 00:31:42.161
- You're gonna staple
the skin back together

466
00:31:42.204 --> 00:31:44.119
and then glue
the hell out of it.

467
00:31:44.163 --> 00:31:46.905
- Are you fucking serious?!
I need a doctor!

468
00:31:46.948 --> 00:31:48.907
- What you need to do
is close the wound

469
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:50.430
and stop that bleeding.

470
00:31:50.473 --> 00:31:52.562
Cause I'’m tired of
cleaning up all the blood.

471
00:31:53.563 --> 00:31:56.044
- I'm not putting this
toxic shit on my skin!

472
00:31:56.088 --> 00:31:59.047
- Last summer I sealed
a giant gash on my leg with it.

473
00:31:59.091 --> 00:32:00.353
I'm still here.

474
00:32:01.484 --> 00:32:02.746
[stapler clicks]

475
00:32:04.487 --> 00:32:06.141
That'’s a good stapler.

476
00:32:20.112 --> 00:32:21.635
- I can'’t do this.

477
00:32:24.681 --> 00:32:26.596
I can'’t squeeze it
at this angle.

478
00:32:27.684 --> 00:32:28.947
Can you help me?

479
00:32:31.471 --> 00:32:33.777
Or do you want me to keep
bleeding all over the place?

480
00:32:37.825 --> 00:32:39.000
- Fine.

481
00:32:46.965 --> 00:32:47.835
Oh...

482
00:32:49.445 --> 00:32:50.707
You think it hit any organs?

483
00:32:50.751 --> 00:32:52.666
- I don'’t know. man.
I'’m still breathing.

484
00:32:53.493 --> 00:32:54.755
- Stay still.

485
00:32:57.236 --> 00:32:58.715
- [screaming]

486
00:33:01.066 --> 00:33:02.458
- Scream into this.

487
00:33:09.248 --> 00:33:10.466
- [stapler clicks]
- [screams]

488
00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:12.338
Wait. Wait Hold on.

489
00:33:13.556 --> 00:33:15.123
Okay. Let'’s go.

490
00:33:17.343 --> 00:33:18.909
- [stapler clicks]
- [screams]

491
00:33:20.128 --> 00:33:21.608
- [stapler clicks]
- [screams]

492
00:33:39.669 --> 00:33:41.410
- How is it doing?

493
00:33:41.454 --> 00:33:43.195
- The glue isn'’t holding well.

494
00:33:43.804 --> 00:33:46.067
What. are you scared
of a little blood?

495
00:33:49.592 --> 00:33:51.159
You are!

496
00:33:51.203 --> 00:33:53.335
- I'’ve just seen too much of it.

497
00:33:53.814 --> 00:33:55.294
- No. I get it.

498
00:33:55.337 --> 00:33:57.687
Even in this mess you got
a total OCD thing going on.

499
00:34:02.779 --> 00:34:04.042
- Hold still.

500
00:34:06.087 --> 00:34:07.480
Blow on it.

501
00:34:09.047 --> 00:34:10.961
[blowing]

502
00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:14.182
[distant chanting]

503
00:34:17.185 --> 00:34:18.534
- What is it?

504
00:34:21.885 --> 00:34:23.626
- Those freaks started a fire.

505
00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:35.421
What are they?
Devil worshippers or witches?

506
00:34:35.464 --> 00:34:37.336
- Does it look like I
would know the difference?

507
00:34:37.379 --> 00:34:38.641
I don't know.

508
00:34:38.685 --> 00:34:40.817
But that's the same shit
they were doing earlier.

509
00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.907
- I thought I'd
seen it all out here.

510
00:34:46.171 --> 00:34:47.433
I guess you never know.

511
00:34:47.476 --> 00:34:48.912
- I'’m still bleeding.

512
00:34:48.956 --> 00:34:50.436
- You gotta stop moving.

513
00:34:50.479 --> 00:34:53.613
- We did it your way
but I still need a doctor.

514
00:34:55.049 --> 00:34:56.268
- I know.

515
00:34:57.225 --> 00:34:58.487
- They'’re together.

516
00:34:58.531 --> 00:34:59.967
You should get your shotgun.

517
00:35:01.055 --> 00:35:02.404
- I'’m gonna need your help.

518
00:35:03.144 --> 00:35:04.276
- I'm here.

519
00:35:05.364 --> 00:35:06.582
- Good.

520
00:35:06.626 --> 00:35:08.497
'Cause I'’m done
with these assholes.

521
00:35:08.541 --> 00:35:09.803
- Same.

522
00:35:10.717 --> 00:35:13.328
[humming and chanting]

523
00:35:31.172 --> 00:35:34.175
- [breathing heavily]

524
00:35:38.701 --> 00:35:40.094
- I need you to keep an eye out.

525
00:35:40.138 --> 00:35:42.575
If any of them
come near me or the house.

526
00:35:42.618 --> 00:35:44.185
don'’t yell.

527
00:35:44.229 --> 00:35:46.187
Blow on this.

528
00:35:46.231 --> 00:35:47.841
And if things go south.

529
00:35:47.884 --> 00:35:50.322
the only weapons in the house
are the knives in this drawer.

530
00:35:59.244 --> 00:36:00.636
When I get outside.

531
00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.769
I gotta unscrew the security
bulb before it goes off.

532
00:36:02.812 --> 00:36:04.684
I think I can hug the wall
and get it.

533
00:36:04.727 --> 00:36:06.947
Don'’t lock the door
until you know I'’m safe.

534
00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:09.341
- Got it.
- Be ready to let me back in.

535
00:36:11.473 --> 00:36:12.909
- Okay.

536
00:36:19.394 --> 00:36:22.571
[humming and chanting]

537
00:36:56.823 --> 00:36:58.172
[stick breaks]

538
00:37:01.001 --> 00:37:03.743
[wind howling]

539
00:37:33.076 --> 00:37:35.731
[tense music]

540
00:37:44.131 --> 00:37:45.480
[distant whistling]

541
00:37:50.224 --> 00:37:51.921
- What?
You gonna shoot us old man?

542
00:37:51.965 --> 00:37:53.488
[grunts]

543
00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:55.577
- Keep fucking with me
and find out!

544
00:37:58.667 --> 00:37:59.842
- [glass shatters]
- [screams]

545
00:37:59.886 --> 00:38:01.279
- Come here you little bitch!

546
00:38:02.367 --> 00:38:04.282
- [thudding]
- [screaming]

547
00:38:07.546 --> 00:38:08.808
[thud]

548
00:38:13.639 --> 00:38:15.249
- He'’s back here!

549
00:38:19.384 --> 00:38:20.820
- I see him!

550
00:38:25.651 --> 00:38:28.044
- Ow! Mother fucker!

551
00:38:34.094 --> 00:38:35.748
Hey! It's me!
Open the door!

552
00:38:37.271 --> 00:38:39.142
Hey!
Open the damn door!

553
00:38:40.579 --> 00:38:42.581
- We got you. fucker!

554
00:38:53.548 --> 00:38:54.767
[camera beeps]

555
00:38:54.897 --> 00:38:56.899
[Kiera screaming]

556
00:38:56.943 --> 00:38:59.032
[thudding]

557
00:39:00.338 --> 00:39:01.556
- Pst.

558
00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:02.862
[thud]

559
00:39:11.174 --> 00:39:13.568
One more step.
I fucking dare you.

560
00:39:13.612 --> 00:39:16.789
- We'’re cool. man.
We just want the girl.

561
00:39:16.832 --> 00:39:17.877
- You ain'’t getting her.

562
00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.618
- Oh. we will.

563
00:39:20.532 --> 00:39:22.534
Pew! Pew!

564
00:39:23.535 --> 00:39:25.363
- [war cry]

565
00:39:28.104 --> 00:39:29.410
[gun shot]

566
00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:33.196
- Open the fucking door!

567
00:39:41.466 --> 00:39:42.684
Are you alright?

568
00:39:42.728 --> 00:39:44.120
- That fucker grabbed me.
but I'’m okay.

569
00:39:44.164 --> 00:39:46.122
We have a gun now. assholes!

570
00:39:46.166 --> 00:39:48.124
- Oh. they know.
I shot one of them.

571
00:39:48.168 --> 00:39:49.256
- Is he dead?

572
00:39:49.299 --> 00:39:50.736
- I don't think so.

573
00:39:51.127 --> 00:39:53.434
That's all I could get.
Plus one in the chamber.

574
00:39:53.478 --> 00:39:55.523
- We're gonna need
more than that.

575
00:39:55.567 --> 00:39:56.959
- It'’ll get us to the truck.

576
00:40:01.094 --> 00:40:03.618
- [groaning in pain]

577
00:40:18.764 --> 00:40:20.026
- What happened?

578
00:40:22.332 --> 00:40:24.422
- I tangled with
a bunch of pricks.

579
00:40:27.773 --> 00:40:29.296
- You can'’t do anything
with those in your hand.

580
00:40:29.339 --> 00:40:30.515
Let me see.

581
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.785
I just realized
I don'’t know your name.

582
00:40:39.828 --> 00:40:40.829
- Reed.

583
00:40:40.873 --> 00:40:42.178
- Kiera.

584
00:40:42.614 --> 00:40:43.919
One more.

585
00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:06.986
- Thank you. Kiera.

586
00:41:20.478 --> 00:41:21.914
Can you run?

587
00:41:21.957 --> 00:41:23.611
- I think so.

588
00:41:23.655 --> 00:41:26.484
- I think they got the hint.
It's time to move.

589
00:41:30.357 --> 00:41:32.838
We'’ll go at your pace
back to the truck.

590
00:41:32.881 --> 00:41:35.493
I'’ll cover you.
Stay low and keep quiet.

591
00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:37.495
- Got it.

592
00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:40.019
- Let's go.

593
00:42:09.135 --> 00:42:10.484
Take it.

594
00:42:14.619 --> 00:42:15.620
[ignition clicks]

595
00:42:16.577 --> 00:42:17.970
You piece of junk.

596
00:42:18.448 --> 00:42:19.493
- What's wrong?

597
00:42:46.912 --> 00:42:48.914
- C'mon.
They fucked it up good.

598
00:42:48.957 --> 00:42:50.350
We gotta go back in.

599
00:42:50.393 --> 00:42:51.873
[knife clinks]

600
00:42:58.924 --> 00:43:00.403
- Looking for something?

601
00:43:01.143 --> 00:43:02.797
You'’re not going
anywhere tonight.

602
00:43:05.757 --> 00:43:06.975
- Shoot her!

603
00:43:07.019 --> 00:43:08.803
- It's only bird shot.
She's out of range!

604
00:43:12.894 --> 00:43:14.026
Give it to me.

605
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:15.549
- Why should I give it to you?

606
00:43:15.593 --> 00:43:17.029
- Maybe I'’ll let you live.

607
00:43:18.726 --> 00:43:20.641
You can stay.
but we're leaving.

608
00:43:20.685 --> 00:43:22.817
- But where will you go?

609
00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:24.950
- Away from you.

610
00:43:26.691 --> 00:43:29.476
- I'm afraid that's not quite
how this evening pans out.

611
00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:37.702
- I'’d advise you
not to get any closer.

612
00:43:38.224 --> 00:43:39.791
- We have such
grand plans for you both.

613
00:43:39.834 --> 00:43:42.271
We can'’t spoil that
by leaving now. can we?

614
00:43:42.315 --> 00:43:45.231
You will both serve well
in our celebration of Orobas!

615
00:43:45.274 --> 00:43:47.233
Mars has risen high
on this very night

616
00:43:47.276 --> 00:43:49.888
and virility courses through
the men who have been graced.

617
00:43:51.019 --> 00:43:53.108
- What in the name of hell
is she talking about?

618
00:43:53.152 --> 00:43:54.719
- Don'’t you know. brother?

619
00:43:54.762 --> 00:43:56.459
Can't you feel it?

620
00:43:56.503 --> 00:43:58.505
The ancient celestials
have aligned

621
00:43:58.548 --> 00:44:01.856
and our union shall spawn
forth His infernal destiny.

622
00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:06.208
Come. let me show you what
generosity Orobas holds for you.

623
00:44:06.252 --> 00:44:09.037
We shall serve together
as generals in his armies.

624
00:44:10.038 --> 00:44:11.170
- [screams]

625
00:44:20.179 --> 00:44:21.659
[gun shot]

626
00:44:31.756 --> 00:44:33.540
Stay the fuck back!

627
00:44:35.455 --> 00:44:36.891
Reed! C'mon get up!

628
00:44:36.935 --> 00:44:38.719
Let'’s go! Get up!

629
00:44:42.549 --> 00:44:43.898
[screams]

630
00:44:45.465 --> 00:44:47.423
Who'’s fucking next?!

631
00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:56.868
Holy shit.

632
00:44:57.564 --> 00:44:59.044
- Nice shot.
- Thanks.

633
00:44:59.087 --> 00:45:00.915
[banging on door]

634
00:45:01.611 --> 00:45:03.788
- Fuck off
or it's your funeral. too!

635
00:45:04.658 --> 00:45:06.399
- You will pay for that.

636
00:45:06.442 --> 00:45:08.096
I promise you.

637
00:45:09.489 --> 00:45:11.012
- Well at least there'’s
one less of 'em.

638
00:45:11.404 --> 00:45:12.666
Hey. what'’s up?

639
00:45:12.971 --> 00:45:14.755
- I'’ve never shot anyone before.

640
00:45:14.799 --> 00:45:16.148
- We got two shells left.

641
00:45:16.191 --> 00:45:17.758
We'll save those
for the biggest guys.

642
00:45:17.802 --> 00:45:19.194
- The bitch is mine.

643
00:45:19.238 --> 00:45:20.587
- They'’re not going anywhere.

644
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:22.110
even if we wait it out
'till sunrise.

645
00:45:22.154 --> 00:45:23.982
- But wouldn'’t people
see from the road?

646
00:45:25.157 --> 00:45:26.767
- Nobody comes down
that road but me.

647
00:45:26.811 --> 00:45:27.812
That'’s why I live here.

648
00:45:27.855 --> 00:45:29.378
- But don'’t you have neighbors?

649
00:45:29.422 --> 00:45:31.816
- This is the only occupied
house around for miles.

650
00:45:31.859 --> 00:45:33.513
The rest are just winter homes.

651
00:45:34.949 --> 00:45:37.343
- I know you must be tripping
with all that blood.

652
00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:41.260
- Yell if you hear anything.

653
00:45:41.303 --> 00:45:43.479
And pop the safety over
if you need to use it.

654
00:45:43.523 --> 00:45:45.133
- Been there. done that.

655
00:46:28.133 --> 00:46:29.525
- Anything?
- Nothing.

656
00:46:29.569 --> 00:46:31.614
So I assume there'’s no way
of fixing the truck?

657
00:46:31.658 --> 00:46:33.573
- Not unless you have
a spare distributor cap.

658
00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:35.836
Where'’s the vehicle
you drove here in?

659
00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:37.272
- It'’s on a dirt road somewhere.

660
00:46:37.707 --> 00:46:38.665
- Where?

661
00:46:38.708 --> 00:46:40.014
- I don'’t know.

662
00:46:40.058 --> 00:46:42.451
- You guys were hanging out
just east of my place.

663
00:46:42.495 --> 00:46:44.323
The road is south.

664
00:46:44.366 --> 00:46:46.716
Which direction did you
drive here to get there?

665
00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:48.109
- Left. right?
I don'’t know.

666
00:46:48.153 --> 00:46:49.676
We smoked a lot of weed today.

667
00:46:49.719 --> 00:46:50.764
- Figures.

668
00:46:51.591 --> 00:46:53.549
- Either way.
I don't have the keys.

669
00:46:53.593 --> 00:46:54.507
- Who does?

670
00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:55.769
- You mean who did?

671
00:46:55.813 --> 00:46:58.250
George had them.
Or maybe Pete. I don't know.

672
00:46:58.293 --> 00:47:00.643
It's wherever they left them
after they attacked us.

673
00:47:00.687 --> 00:47:02.341
- You remember where that was?

674
00:47:02.384 --> 00:47:03.821
- Wherever their bonfire was.

675
00:47:03.864 --> 00:47:05.605
I don't fucking know.

676
00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:08.477
But I did come up from
the front of your house.

677
00:47:08.521 --> 00:47:10.697
- Okay. that'’s a start.

678
00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:12.177
That's from the south.

679
00:47:13.221 --> 00:47:15.093
If you can hold on
for just a few more hours.

680
00:47:15.136 --> 00:47:18.444
'til sunrise.
we can take the shotgun

681
00:47:18.487 --> 00:47:20.272
and go there and get the keys.

682
00:47:21.839 --> 00:47:23.492
What's wrong?

683
00:47:23.536 --> 00:47:24.972
- I'm fine.

684
00:47:25.146 --> 00:47:26.887
So what'’s your deal. Reed?

685
00:47:26.931 --> 00:47:28.454
- What do you mean.
what's my deal?

686
00:47:28.497 --> 00:47:30.891
- Why do you live out here
surrounded by nothing?

687
00:47:30.935 --> 00:47:33.720
- Why did you come to my house
and fuck my life up?

688
00:47:33.763 --> 00:47:35.156
- Survival!

689
00:47:38.377 --> 00:47:40.031
Do you have a family?

690
00:47:41.859 --> 00:47:43.861
- Not any more.
- What?

691
00:47:45.514 --> 00:47:46.907
- They're all dead.

692
00:47:48.648 --> 00:47:51.129
- Sorry. That sucks.

693
00:47:53.609 --> 00:47:55.742
- So how long were
you guys out there camping?

694
00:48:00.442 --> 00:48:02.227
- We just got here today.

695
00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:04.272
We were supposed to stay
through the weekend.

696
00:48:05.795 --> 00:48:07.362
- I'm sorry about your friends.

697
00:48:07.406 --> 00:48:09.756
- Are you just saying that
because that'’s what people say?

698
00:48:11.758 --> 00:48:12.890
- Yeah. I guess so.

699
00:48:12.933 --> 00:48:14.195
- I figured.

700
00:48:15.153 --> 00:48:16.502
- I actually mean it.

701
00:48:17.372 --> 00:48:19.635
- You know. I had
a bad feeling about this trip.

702
00:48:19.984 --> 00:48:22.682
I was planning on breaking up
with Pete when we got back home.

703
00:48:22.725 --> 00:48:23.857
He had no idea.

704
00:48:23.901 --> 00:48:26.251
But I'’d been wanting out
for a long time.

705
00:48:26.294 --> 00:48:28.557
But you know how it is
when you'’re in a relationship.

706
00:48:29.645 --> 00:48:31.212
- No. I don'’t.

707
00:48:31.256 --> 00:48:33.345
- What? You'’ve never
been in a relationship?

708
00:48:33.388 --> 00:48:35.042
- Nothing longer than a night.

709
00:48:35.086 --> 00:48:36.261
- That'’s wild.

710
00:48:36.304 --> 00:48:38.698
- That was over
twenty years ago.

711
00:48:38.741 --> 00:48:41.005
- And that explains why
you'’re pissed off all the time.

712
00:48:41.048 --> 00:48:42.354
- [chuckles]

713
00:48:42.397 --> 00:48:44.269
You're lucky you
caught me on a good day.

714
00:48:46.924 --> 00:48:48.360
So where'’s your family?

715
00:48:48.403 --> 00:48:50.753
- My mom'’s in Florida
taking care of my son.

716
00:48:50.797 --> 00:48:52.103
- Wait. you got a kid?

717
00:48:52.146 --> 00:48:54.670
- I do.
He's four years old.

718
00:48:54.714 --> 00:48:56.977
His name'’s Roger
but I call him Buzz.

719
00:48:57.021 --> 00:48:59.458
I'’d show you a picture but...

720
00:48:59.501 --> 00:49:01.025
I don'’t have my phone.

721
00:49:01.068 --> 00:49:03.331
- You have a four year old?
You're just a kid yourself.

722
00:49:04.637 --> 00:49:06.465
- I need to get home.

723
00:49:07.335 --> 00:49:08.946
- Let me show you something.

724
00:49:10.164 --> 00:49:11.992
Can you get up?

725
00:49:12.036 --> 00:49:13.646
- Yeah. I think so.

726
00:49:17.084 --> 00:49:18.129
- This is Marlon.

727
00:49:18.868 --> 00:49:22.046
- Oh my gosh. he'’s adorable.

728
00:49:22.089 --> 00:49:24.918
- Well rise and shine.
little buddy.

729
00:49:24.962 --> 00:49:26.311
Say hi to Kiera.

730
00:49:26.354 --> 00:49:27.921
- Hi. Marlon.

731
00:49:28.617 --> 00:49:30.358
- He'’s all I got.

732
00:49:30.402 --> 00:49:34.101
If I don'’t make it out of here.
please take care of him for me.

733
00:49:34.145 --> 00:49:36.190
- Okay. Of course.

734
00:49:36.364 --> 00:49:37.887
What does he eat?

735
00:49:37.931 --> 00:49:39.106
- Bloodworms.

736
00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:40.803
And the occasional guppy.

737
00:49:42.849 --> 00:49:44.807
Go back to bed. little bud.

738
00:49:50.813 --> 00:49:52.293
- I'’m sorry.

739
00:49:52.337 --> 00:49:54.992
I'’m sorry that my friends
chose your place to camp.

740
00:49:55.035 --> 00:49:58.212
I'm sorry I brought those crazy
fucks back to your place.

741
00:49:58.256 --> 00:50:01.737
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for everything.

742
00:50:01.781 --> 00:50:03.391
- It'’s not your fault.

743
00:50:03.435 --> 00:50:06.177
Please.
I need you to keep it together.

744
00:50:07.308 --> 00:50:08.962
- I had family.

745
00:50:09.963 --> 00:50:12.096
I had friends.

746
00:50:12.139 --> 00:50:14.011
- You still have friends.

747
00:50:19.277 --> 00:50:21.366
- What about your parents. Reed?

748
00:50:21.409 --> 00:50:23.281
[bang]

749
00:50:23.324 --> 00:50:25.065

751
00:51:28.868 --> 00:51:30.739
- Are you ready for us.
sweet doe?

752
00:51:33.177 --> 00:51:34.569
I'’m right here.

753
00:51:36.354 --> 00:51:38.095
I always will be.

754
00:51:38.878 --> 00:51:39.748
Kiera!

[items crashing]

758
00:52:16.437 --> 00:52:17.438
On your feet!

759
00:52:17.482 --> 00:52:18.961
- Or what?
You gonna shoot me?

760
00:52:19.005 --> 00:52:20.441
- No. I'm gonna walk out front

761
00:52:20.485 --> 00:52:21.747
and shoot your
den mother in the gut.

762
00:52:21.790 --> 00:52:23.488
and make you
watch her bleed out.

763
00:52:24.532 --> 00:52:26.012
Hurry up. mother fucker!

764
00:52:26.534 --> 00:52:27.622
- Oh. shit.

765
00:52:27.666 --> 00:52:28.841
You alright?

766
00:52:28.884 --> 00:52:30.582
- I'’m here.
- [window breaks]

767
00:52:30.625 --> 00:52:32.410
Go check it out!
Holler if you need me.

768
00:52:34.107 --> 00:52:35.413
Now turn around.

769
00:52:35.456 --> 00:52:36.936
March!

770
00:52:46.032 --> 00:52:47.381
- [groans in pain]

771
00:52:47.425 --> 00:52:49.296
I'm gonna rape
your mother for that!

772
00:52:53.561 --> 00:52:54.910
- Listen up. freaks!

773
00:52:55.737 --> 00:52:56.999
Go back to where
you came from before

774
00:52:57.043 --> 00:52:59.176
I blow his dog shit brains
all over this yard.

775
00:52:59.219 --> 00:53:01.656
- No need for any
more of that. brother.

776
00:53:02.135 --> 00:53:03.745
- You have sixty seconds!

777
00:53:04.442 --> 00:53:07.749
- Set Brother Earl free.
He is required for the ceremony.

778
00:53:07.793 --> 00:53:09.664
Spare him
and you'’ll live forever.

779
00:53:10.274 --> 00:53:11.753
- Forty-five seconds!

780
00:53:12.363 --> 00:53:14.103
- You know we're not leaving.

781
00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:17.063
- They're really showing
how much they care about you.

782
00:53:17.106 --> 00:53:18.673
How's that feel tough guy?

783
00:53:21.676 --> 00:53:23.330
- [grunting in effort]

784
00:53:28.509 --> 00:53:30.163
- I'm gonna put you
in your grave!

785
00:53:38.215 --> 00:53:39.738
[gun shot]

786
00:53:44.786 --> 00:53:48.137
- You may not live
to regret that. brother!

787
00:53:48.181 --> 00:53:49.487
- Take the rest of your creeps

788
00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:51.793
and fuck off
or I swear you're next.

789
00:53:51.837 --> 00:53:54.753
- You people and your guns.

790
00:53:54.796 --> 00:53:56.798
You have no idea what it means

791
00:53:56.842 --> 00:54:00.062
to take a life
with intimacy and meaning.

792
00:54:05.067 --> 00:54:06.417
[gun shot]

793
00:54:08.984 --> 00:54:10.682
[Kiera grunting]

794
00:54:21.954 --> 00:54:23.521
- Back off inbred!

795
00:54:25.697 --> 00:54:27.525
- He was cutting the bars
with a hacksaw.

796
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:28.830
- You holding up?

797
00:54:28.874 --> 00:54:29.831
- I'’m here.

798
00:54:29.875 --> 00:54:31.137
What was that gunshot?

799
00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:33.052
- RIP another scumbag.

800
00:54:33.095 --> 00:54:34.271
- Nice.

801
00:54:35.141 --> 00:54:36.142
What happened?!

802
00:54:36.185 --> 00:54:37.796
- Fucker got me with a crowbar.

803
00:54:38.666 --> 00:54:40.015
- Let me see.

804
00:54:40.451 --> 00:54:42.322
It looks like it'’s
your turn for the stapler.

805
00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:50.374
- We'’re running out of time.

806
00:54:51.375 --> 00:54:53.333
- They'’ll come out soon.

807
00:54:53.377 --> 00:54:55.030
I can feel it.

808
00:54:55.074 --> 00:54:57.032
- We'll burn them out
if they don'’t.

809
00:55:01.167 --> 00:55:03.865
- I don'’t think we should
stick around here any longer.

810
00:55:03.909 --> 00:55:06.085
- I thought we were
waiting for daylight.

811
00:55:06.128 --> 00:55:08.130
- Yeah well.

812
00:55:08.174 --> 00:55:10.916
we're out of shells
and outnumbered.

813
00:55:13.875 --> 00:55:15.573
We'’re sitting in a death trap.

814
00:55:17.618 --> 00:55:19.403
- Shit. your arm is
really fucked. isn'’t it.

815
00:55:19.446 --> 00:55:21.230
- It'’s fine. It's good.

816
00:55:21.274 --> 00:55:22.667
- Grab that cup then.

817
00:55:24.451 --> 00:55:26.758
Look. Reed.
if your arm isn'’t working.

818
00:55:26.801 --> 00:55:28.412
I need to know.

819
00:55:28.455 --> 00:55:29.543
We'’re in this together.

820
00:55:29.587 --> 00:55:31.415
- My hand's gone numb.
- Let me see.

821
00:55:32.111 --> 00:55:33.591
Can you feel this?

822
00:55:34.418 --> 00:55:35.810
Can you at least move it?

823
00:55:36.811 --> 00:55:38.291
Alright. that'’s a start.

824
00:55:50.042 --> 00:55:51.957
[dramatic music]

825
00:55:59.443 --> 00:56:00.487
Reed.

826
00:56:00.531 --> 00:56:01.488
The car keys!

827
00:56:01.532 --> 00:56:02.707
- Remember where you parked?

828
00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:04.448
- I don'’t!
It was too dark.

829
00:56:04.491 --> 00:56:06.188
- C'mon think. Think. Think.

830
00:56:06.232 --> 00:56:07.233
Remember.
Where did you park?

831
00:56:07.276 --> 00:56:09.061
- I'’m trying! I'm trying.

832
00:56:09.104 --> 00:56:11.411
Wait. there was this beat up
couch on the side of the road.

833
00:56:11.455 --> 00:56:12.978
- The one with
the peace sign on it?

834
00:56:13.021 --> 00:56:13.935
- Yes!

835
00:56:13.979 --> 00:56:15.633
- I know where that is.

836
00:56:15.676 --> 00:56:18.331
- OK. but what about the rest
of the maniacs out there?

837
00:56:18.375 --> 00:56:20.551
- It'’s only a matter of time
before they get in here

838
00:56:20.594 --> 00:56:21.900
and kill us.

839
00:56:21.943 --> 00:56:23.771
- Alright. You got a plan?

840
00:56:24.381 --> 00:56:27.166
- Yes. But first I'’ll need
your help with something.

841
00:56:27.209 --> 00:56:28.559
- I'm here.

842
00:56:39.221 --> 00:56:40.788
- Hey. little buddy.

843
00:56:40.832 --> 00:56:43.138
Yeah.
I'’ll be back soon.

844
00:56:45.793 --> 00:56:47.360
Don'’t you worry.

845
00:57:06.379 --> 00:57:08.250
Maybe they don'’t know
we'’re out of shells.

846
00:57:08.294 --> 00:57:09.426
So act like you'’re not.

847
00:57:09.469 --> 00:57:10.470
- Okay.

848
00:57:10.514 --> 00:57:11.602
- When you head out
the back door.

849
00:57:11.645 --> 00:57:13.125
run straight into the desert.

850
00:57:13.168 --> 00:57:15.127
About three hundred yards
you'll come to an old well.

851
00:57:15.170 --> 00:57:17.129
If they make it and I don't.

852
00:57:17.172 --> 00:57:18.783
keep running in that direction.

853
00:57:18.826 --> 00:57:20.480
You're gonna find
the couch and your car.

854
00:57:20.524 --> 00:57:21.960
- Wait. what'’s going on?

855
00:57:22.003 --> 00:57:23.527
- I'’m heading up to the roof.

856
00:57:23.570 --> 00:57:25.572
I'm gonna divert them all
to the front of the house.

857
00:57:25.616 --> 00:57:27.618
Once you see them there
head out the back door.

858
00:57:27.661 --> 00:57:28.836
but leave it open.

859
00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:30.142
To lure them in.

860
00:57:30.490 --> 00:57:33.972
- No. no. we'’re in this
together. we leave together.

861
00:57:34.015 --> 00:57:35.364
- You'’re in bad shape.

862
00:57:35.713 --> 00:57:37.236
If you can just get
past the house lights

863
00:57:37.279 --> 00:57:39.368
and into the darkness.
they won'’t see you.

864
00:57:39.412 --> 00:57:41.806
And I can distract them long
enough to give you some time.

865
00:57:41.849 --> 00:57:43.982
Just get to your car.
- I'’m not leaving you.

866
00:57:44.983 --> 00:57:46.767
- Do you want to see
your son again?

867
00:57:47.681 --> 00:57:49.204
I'’ll be right behind you.

868
00:58:12.924 --> 00:58:14.839
Attention you assholes.

869
00:58:18.538 --> 00:58:19.713
We'’re injured.

870
00:58:19.757 --> 00:58:20.975
We're not gonna
make it through the night.

871
00:58:21.019 --> 00:58:22.368
We need to get to a hospital.

872
00:58:22.411 --> 00:58:24.196
- We can help you with that.

873
00:58:24.239 --> 00:58:25.763
- How do we end this?

874
00:58:30.768 --> 00:58:32.596
- Come down
and join our reveling.

875
00:58:32.639 --> 00:58:34.772
- Not until I know that
the girl won'’t be harmed.

876
00:58:34.815 --> 00:58:36.208
- How noble of you.

877
00:58:36.251 --> 00:58:38.297
- Where is she?

878
00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:39.428
- She's in the bedroom.

879
00:58:39.472 --> 00:58:40.778
- Interesting.

880
00:58:40.821 --> 00:58:42.562
- Passed out from loss of blood.

881
00:58:42.606 --> 00:58:44.433
- I want to see her.

882
00:58:44.477 --> 00:58:46.914
- Not until I know
what you want with us.

883
00:58:48.002 --> 00:58:49.569
- We'’re running short on time.
brother.

884
00:58:49.613 --> 00:58:51.223
Come down. partake with us.

885
00:58:51.266 --> 00:58:52.746
and then we'’ll
explain everything

886
00:58:52.790 --> 00:58:54.487
on the way to the hospital.

887
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:06.020
- Where'’s your vehicle?
- It'’s far away.

888
00:59:06.064 --> 00:59:07.108
- Get it.

889
00:59:07.152 --> 00:59:09.763
- Your demands
exhaust my patience.

890
00:59:09.807 --> 00:59:11.199
Priestess!

891
00:59:12.331 --> 00:59:13.811
- The back door is open!

892
00:59:15.508 --> 00:59:17.336
- She'’s not there. is she?

893
00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:25.779
- [panting]

894
00:59:42.056 --> 00:59:43.580
[plate shatters]

895
00:59:44.581 --> 00:59:47.235
- For fuck's sake?
You and that camera.

896
00:59:47.279 --> 00:59:49.150
- C'mon man. it's tradition.

897
00:59:49.194 --> 00:59:51.283
- I've told you before.
Get it outta my face

898
00:59:51.326 --> 00:59:53.241
or I'm gonna bust it
over your head.

899
00:59:53.807 --> 00:59:54.895
Find them!

900
01:00:06.254 --> 01:00:07.691
[crashing]

901
01:00:14.001 --> 01:00:15.960
- [panting]

902
01:00:24.795 --> 01:00:27.232
[crying]

903
01:00:46.033 --> 01:00:47.992
[smashing]

904
01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.022
- Say cheese!

905
01:01:18.065 --> 01:01:19.632
- Surprise fuck face!

906
01:01:21.503 --> 01:01:23.418
[grunts]

907
01:01:26.552 --> 01:01:28.685
[thudding]

908
01:01:35.822 --> 01:01:37.302
- [primal scream]

909
01:01:48.356 --> 01:01:50.663
- [war cry]

910
01:01:53.797 --> 01:01:56.060
- Bring it on. you fucking cunt!
- Get down there!

911
01:02:03.110 --> 01:02:05.243
[sinister laugh]

912
01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:09.203
- [screaming]

913
01:02:14.034 --> 01:02:16.036
- [screaming]

914
01:02:20.345 --> 01:02:21.694
[thud]

915
01:02:26.612 --> 01:02:28.179
[thud]

916
01:02:35.839 --> 01:02:38.450
[ominous music]

917
01:02:39.625 --> 01:02:41.932
[fire crackling]

918
01:02:51.942 --> 01:02:54.466
[bottles clinking]

919
01:03:03.431 --> 01:03:04.606
- Kiera.

920
01:03:04.868 --> 01:03:06.173
Why'’d you come back?

921
01:03:08.523 --> 01:03:10.656
- I don'’t feel so good.

922
01:03:12.223 --> 01:03:13.790
- You don'’t look so good.

923
01:03:14.138 --> 01:03:15.400
- Excellent!

924
01:03:15.443 --> 01:03:17.402
You're awake
and can finally commence!

925
01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:19.926
Did you dream well. brother?

926
01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:21.580
- What the fuck do you want?

927
01:03:21.623 --> 01:03:24.496
- Isn'’t it curious how some
questions reveal their answers?

928
01:03:26.324 --> 01:03:27.934
- [Kiera screaming]

929
01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:29.327
- You can and kill
me all you want.

930
01:03:29.370 --> 01:03:30.763
Just let her go.

931
01:03:31.459 --> 01:03:33.331
- Nobility is a trait
very much lacking

932
01:03:33.374 --> 01:03:34.985
among the subhumans
of this realm.

933
01:03:35.028 --> 01:03:37.204
so your gesture is unexpected.

934
01:03:37.248 --> 01:03:38.640
But unfortunately.

935
01:03:38.684 --> 01:03:41.208
you are both
very much needed tonight.

936
01:03:42.862 --> 01:03:47.432
- Lady what you need
is professional help.

937
01:03:48.259 --> 01:03:52.089
- You really don'’t understand
why you're here. do you?

938
01:03:53.177 --> 01:03:55.875
The ancients
they knew the importance

939
01:03:55.919 --> 01:03:57.355
of building strength
through lineage.

940
01:03:57.398 --> 01:03:59.618
Like the deitiesIsis isis
and Osiris.

941
01:03:59.661 --> 01:04:02.664
the Pharaohs often mated
with their first degrees.

942
01:04:02.708 --> 01:04:05.580
Through these magical couplings
their dynasties gained strength.

943
01:04:05.624 --> 01:04:08.453
And under the alignment
of certain stars

944
01:04:08.496 --> 01:04:09.933
these intertwined offspring

945
01:04:09.976 --> 01:04:11.717
could be made
even more powerful.

946
01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:15.286
And on rare occasions
like tonight.

947
01:04:15.329 --> 01:04:16.853
they could even
bring forth the gods

948
01:04:16.896 --> 01:04:18.767
they worshiped in human form.

949
01:04:19.943 --> 01:04:21.509
- What kind of fucking
drugs are you guys on?

950
01:04:21.553 --> 01:04:24.382
- Orobas shall return
and take his rightful place

951
01:04:24.425 --> 01:04:26.036
as ruler of this domain.

952
01:04:26.079 --> 01:04:29.082
and we have been chosen
as the ones who bring him forth.

953
01:04:29.822 --> 01:04:31.563
I need your river of life.

954
01:04:33.565 --> 01:04:35.959
- River of what?
- Your river of life.

955
01:04:36.785 --> 01:04:39.745
The seed that Enki
implanted into Ninhursag

956
01:04:39.788 --> 01:04:41.703
to make her bare Ninsar.

957
01:04:43.009 --> 01:04:44.706
Let it flow into me.

958
01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:48.885
- Somebody please tell me what
the fuck she's talking about?

959
01:04:50.147 --> 01:04:52.366
- She wants you to fuck her.
Reed.

960
01:04:54.194 --> 01:04:57.023
- Exactly. my sweet doe.

961
01:04:57.067 --> 01:04:59.591
You need to fuck
a child into me.

962
01:04:59.634 --> 01:05:01.419
Is that clear enough for you?

963
01:05:01.462 --> 01:05:03.203
- No. no.

964
01:05:03.247 --> 01:05:06.511
No. get one of your brain dead
goons for that kinky shit.

965
01:05:06.554 --> 01:05:09.862
- They'’re not special like you.
Not like you at all.

966
01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:12.821
You have been touched
by the spirit of Orobas as well

967
01:05:12.865 --> 01:05:14.606
and. as such.
you must be the one

968
01:05:14.649 --> 01:05:16.173
to ignite the spark within me.

969
01:05:16.216 --> 01:05:18.958
On this night the prophecy
dictates the viability

970
01:05:19.002 --> 01:05:21.743
of our union and the health
of our spawn is assured.

971
01:05:21.787 --> 01:05:25.008
- I'm nobody.
Please leave me alone.

972
01:05:25.051 --> 01:05:27.575
- In due time. Just cooperate.

973
01:05:32.711 --> 01:05:34.452
- Go fuck yourself.

974
01:05:36.802 --> 01:05:39.065
- Since you'’re a man that needs
a little encouragement.

975
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:41.763
your little friend here
is my bargaining chip.

976
01:05:41.807 --> 01:05:43.461
Your performance for her life.

977
01:05:44.984 --> 01:05:46.812
- You sick freak!

978
01:05:47.856 --> 01:05:49.075
- Shame.

979
01:05:51.425 --> 01:05:53.558
I was hoping you'’d
find me enchanting.

980
01:05:54.037 --> 01:05:56.648
- I find you repulsive.

981
01:05:57.649 --> 01:05:59.999
- I don'’t know if I should be
flattered or offended.

982
01:06:00.521 --> 01:06:03.524
- What you should be is dead.

983
01:06:03.568 --> 01:06:05.178
[laughs]

984
01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:08.790
- Why do you
have to make this...

985
01:06:10.227 --> 01:06:12.011
...so hard?

986
01:06:13.882 --> 01:06:15.319
- Get off me.

987
01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:18.409
- The longer you resist.
the more pain we will inflict.

988
01:06:18.452 --> 01:06:21.760
Your agony will pale
in comparison to hers.

989
01:06:21.803 --> 01:06:23.370
Shall we continue?

990
01:06:24.850 --> 01:06:27.984
- Die!
I'd rather die than fuck you.

991
01:06:30.595 --> 01:06:32.118
- Sister Maxine?

992
01:06:33.554 --> 01:06:35.817
- [sinister laugh]

993
01:06:37.645 --> 01:06:40.257
- [Kiera crying]

994
01:06:58.144 --> 01:06:59.841
- You gonna die.

995
01:07:06.413 --> 01:07:08.763
- Wait. Wait.

996
01:07:09.808 --> 01:07:12.071
- [gun shot]
- [screaming]

997
01:07:12.115 --> 01:07:13.899
- Wait! Stop!

998
01:07:14.856 --> 01:07:16.075
I'’ll do it!

999
01:07:16.119 --> 01:07:18.208
- [crying]

1000
01:07:19.339 --> 01:07:20.819
- Let'’s begin.

1001
01:07:20.949 --> 01:07:23.952
- If I do this.
will you let her live?

1002
01:07:23.996 --> 01:07:25.519
- You have my word.

1003
01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:28.479
- Let'’s go.

1004
01:07:29.088 --> 01:07:30.916
- I thought you'’d never ask.

1005
01:07:37.401 --> 01:07:38.619
[thud]

1006
01:07:39.229 --> 01:07:41.318
[horns sounding]

1007
01:07:50.675 --> 01:07:52.546
- I can't do it
in front of these creeps.

1008
01:07:52.590 --> 01:07:54.200
- They are essential
for the ceremony.

1009
01:07:54.244 --> 01:07:55.984
No ceremony. no magic.

1010
01:08:07.170 --> 01:08:10.608
Don'’t worry. just focus on us.

1011
01:08:36.764 --> 01:08:38.723
Dearest Reed.

1012
01:08:38.766 --> 01:08:41.682
it is time for you
to learn who you really are.

1013
01:08:46.209 --> 01:08:47.514
Let go...

1014
01:08:50.038 --> 01:08:52.432
Many years ago.
under a full moon like tonight.

1015
01:08:52.476 --> 01:08:55.827
I was born into the arms of
the ancient demon Orobas.

1016
01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:58.308
My parents gave their lives
so I could take my place

1017
01:08:58.351 --> 01:09:01.093
as high priestess
of the dark arts.

1018
01:09:01.137 --> 01:09:03.748
My mother was the most
beautiful woman on Earth.

1019
01:09:03.791 --> 01:09:06.359
but she harbored
a secret my father didn'’t know.

1020
01:09:06.403 --> 01:09:08.927
nor did my brethren until later.

1021
01:09:08.970 --> 01:09:12.322
A secret we have
sought my entire life.

1022
01:09:12.365 --> 01:09:14.193
I had a twin brother.

1023
01:09:14.237 --> 01:09:16.326
And we have finally found him.

1024
01:09:16.978 --> 01:09:18.197
It was such a shame
that you and I

1025
01:09:18.241 --> 01:09:19.981
didn'’t get to
grow up together.

1026
01:09:20.895 --> 01:09:23.637
But now we'’re forever
united in creating the vessel

1027
01:09:23.681 --> 01:09:26.162
through which Orobas
will take human form.

1028
01:09:26.901 --> 01:09:30.209
He shall rise again to
reclaim all that once was his.

1029
01:09:45.442 --> 01:09:48.532
How does it feel to
fuck your twin sister?

1030
01:10:10.728 --> 01:10:14.253
[moaning]

1031
01:10:36.449 --> 01:10:38.190
You'’ve done very well. brother.

1032
01:10:38.234 --> 01:10:40.801
Your virility has
matched your blood lust.

1033
01:10:40.845 --> 01:10:41.976
We have fulfilled our birthright

1034
01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:43.630
and our child
will rule this dimension

1035
01:10:43.674 --> 01:10:45.458
as destined by prophecy.

1036
01:10:46.459 --> 01:10:48.069
- I'’m sorry.

1037
01:10:49.157 --> 01:10:51.595
- Even though Sister Maxine
would prefer I not.

1038
01:10:51.638 --> 01:10:53.814
I shall spare your life.

1039
01:10:53.858 --> 01:10:56.295
- Will you please
fucking untie us now?

1040
01:10:56.339 --> 01:10:58.210
- Don't push it. sweet doe.

1041
01:10:58.254 --> 01:11:00.125
I only promised to let you live.

1042
01:11:04.042 --> 01:11:07.828
- Someday.
I'’m going to find him

1043
01:11:07.872 --> 01:11:11.876
and I'm gonna cut his
heart out while you watch.

1044
01:11:11.919 --> 01:11:13.834
- Eat shit. you fucking bitch!

1045
01:11:13.878 --> 01:11:15.227
[spits]

1046
01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:17.229
[screams]

1047
01:11:18.448 --> 01:11:19.927
- Hey. lover boy!

1048
01:11:20.885 --> 01:11:22.278
Look what I found!

1049
01:11:24.367 --> 01:11:26.934
This is for our fallen brothers.

1050
01:11:28.109 --> 01:11:30.068
- Don'’t you fucking do it!

1051
01:11:39.033 --> 01:11:41.079
- Onward. brethren.

1052
01:11:41.122 --> 01:11:42.863
We have much to do.

1053
01:11:53.178 --> 01:11:54.788
- Reed. Reed.

1054
01:12:04.407 --> 01:12:06.670
Come on. Lets go!

1055
01:12:12.545 --> 01:12:13.981
- It'’s not done.

1056
01:12:14.678 --> 01:12:16.027
- What do you mean?

1057
01:12:17.681 --> 01:12:19.247
- Marlon.

1058
01:12:19.291 --> 01:12:20.814
- I'’m sorry.

1059
01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.950
- Listen.
run to the road that way.

1060
01:12:25.993 --> 01:12:28.039
In a few hours.
you'’ll hit a gas station.

1061
01:12:28.996 --> 01:12:30.563
Get the fuck out of here.

1062
01:12:30.824 --> 01:12:33.174
I'’m killing every
goddamned one of them.

1063
01:12:33.827 --> 01:12:35.612
- Not without me.

1064
01:12:36.482 --> 01:12:38.658
- Are you sure you want
to leave them like that?

1065
01:12:39.572 --> 01:12:41.182
- The girl is ready to pass.

1066
01:12:41.226 --> 01:12:44.403
Starvation and dehydration
