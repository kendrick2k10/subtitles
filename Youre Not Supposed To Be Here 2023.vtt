00:00:18.667 --> 00:00:19.333
- Oh.

6
00:00:23.542 --> 00:00:24.250
Oh.

7
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.250
Oh.

8
00:00:33.875 --> 00:00:35.083
Kick if you're scared. too.

00:00:36.792 --> 00:00:38.667
(Zoe laughing)

10
00:00:38.792 --> 00:00:39.417
Hello.

11
00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:42.542
Is this scary for you?

12
00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:48.083
You know what?

13
00:00:48.167 --> 00:00:50.250
You actually haven't
kicked in a while.

14
00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:55.167
so this always does
the trick. (grunting)

15
00:00:57.833 --> 00:01:00.792
There we go.
(pensive music)

16
00:01:00.875 --> 00:01:01.417
Hey there.

17
00:01:04.792 --> 00:01:06.000
Hello. come on.

18
00:01:06.083 --> 00:01:08.250
Can you give me a little
kick if you're okay?

19
00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:13.583
Hello?

20
00:01:17.375 --> 00:01:18.167
Mm.

21
00:01:20.417 --> 00:01:21.167
Oh. oh.

22
00:01:24.708 --> 00:01:25.458
Okay.

23
00:01:28.417 --> 00:01:29.292
Okay.

24
00:01:32.083 --> 00:01:33.542
Oh. God. I'm dizzy.

25
00:01:39.917 --> 00:01:41.083
(Zoe groans)

26
00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:44.167
(phone buzzing)

27
00:01:44.208 --> 00:01:45.875
(phone clanking)

28
00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:46.917
- Here you go. Kennedy.

29
00:01:46.917 --> 00:01:48.083
Why don't you. uh. go ahead

30
00:01:48.167 --> 00:01:48.792
and lead us off with
your presentation?

31
00:01:48.792 --> 00:01:49.458
- Got it.

32
00:01:51.708 --> 00:01:54.083
(sighs) Okay.

33
00:01:56.208 --> 00:02:00.333
Thank you so much for taking
the time to meet with us.

34
00:02:00.375 --> 00:02:01.583
My name is Kennedy Quinn.

35
00:02:01.708 --> 00:02:04.417
and I handle all of
your external accounts.

36
00:02:04.542 --> 00:02:08.500
I'm going to tell you why
Henderson Investing is

37
00:02:08.583 --> 00:02:13.417
the best firm to take on Maury
Technology's financial needs.

38
00:02:13.542 --> 00:02:16.167
(phone buzzing)

39
00:02:16.208 --> 00:02:18.833
Some may say that our
firm being smaller

40
00:02:18.875 --> 00:02:22.125
than the average large-scale
firm is a disadvantage.

41
00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:28.167
but the truth is. our
close-knit team is stronger

42
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.750
and more communicative.
(phone buzzing)

43
00:02:29.833 --> 00:02:34.500
giving each client
a personalized
investing experience.

44
00:02:34.583 --> 00:02:36.833
(phone buzzing)

45
00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:41.708
- Do you need to
take that. Ms. Quinn?

46
00:02:41.833 --> 00:02:43.500
- I'm so sorry.

47
00:02:43.583 --> 00:02:45.375
It's my wife.
(tablet clanking)

48
00:02:45.458 --> 00:02:47.417
I will be right back.

49
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.250
(door clattering)
(Kennedy sighing)

50
00:02:51.333 --> 00:02:53.333
Zoe. what is going on?

51
00:02:53.458 --> 00:02:55.000
- Kennedy. something's wrong.
(pensive music)

52
00:02:55.125 --> 00:02:55.917
- [Kennedy] What happened?

53
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.417
Are you okay?

54
00:02:57.542 --> 00:03:00.000
- The baby's not kicking
anymore. and I'm really dizzy.

55
00:03:00.125 --> 00:03:01.333
and I can't really breathe.

56
00:03:01.417 --> 00:03:03.042
and I'm just scared that
it's happening again.

57
00:03:03.125 --> 00:03:05.000
- [Kennedy] Okay.
call an ambulance.

58
00:03:05.042 --> 00:03:05.875
- Okay.
- I will meet you

59
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.958
at the hospital.

60
00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.500
It's gonna be okay.

61
00:03:08.542 --> 00:03:10.792
- I don't know. she's
not moving. and oh. oh.

62
00:03:13.583 --> 00:03:15.417
- [Kennedy] What.
what. what happened?

63
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.000
- She just kicked. (laughing)

64
00:03:19.167 --> 00:03:20.417
She just kicked.

65
00:03:20.542 --> 00:03:24.333
- Zoe.
- I thought. I'm sorry.

66
00:03:24.375 --> 00:03:26.292
- [Kennedy] Another panic
attack. this isn't healthy

67
00:03:26.375 --> 00:03:28.000
for you or the baby.

68
00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:29.542
- I know.

69
00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:31.167
She hadn't kicked in
a really long time.

70
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.792
and I thought about
the last time.

71
00:03:32.875 --> 00:03:35.250
and I was afraid that
I was losing her.

72
00:03:35.333 --> 00:03:38.708
- I know. I know. but that's
not going to happen. okay?

73
00:03:38.792 --> 00:03:41.000
Look. I'm in the middle
of a huge presentation

74
00:03:41.042 --> 00:03:41.833
to a new client.

75
00:03:41.917 --> 00:03:42.875
I have to go.

76
00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:43.958
- [Zoe] I'm really sorry.

77
00:03:44.042 --> 00:03:47.125
- Just try to relax. please.

78
00:03:47.208 --> 00:03:48.833
- Okay. I'll see
you back at home.

79
00:03:50.875 --> 00:03:52.542
(phone beeping)

80
00:03:52.625 --> 00:03:55.083
(door clattering and squeaking)

81
00:03:55.167 --> 00:03:57.000
(Kennedy laughs)

82
00:03:57.083 --> 00:03:59.708
- I am so sorry for
the interruption.

83
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.333
Um. (laughs) as I was saying.

84
00:04:06.292 --> 00:04:08.792
(Zoe exhaling)

85
00:04:14.208 --> 00:04:17.333
(engines humming)

86
00:04:17.375 --> 00:04:18.333
(hand knocking)

87
00:04:18.375 --> 00:04:19.542
- [Robert] Congratulations.

88
00:04:19.625 --> 00:04:21.000
Thought you could use
something to celebrate.

89
00:04:21.042 --> 00:04:22.583
- Thank you.

90
00:04:22.708 --> 00:04:24.458
I was actually just getting
started on the Maury account.

91
00:04:24.542 --> 00:04:26.333
- Uh. leave that for now.

92
00:04:26.417 --> 00:04:27.958
Enjoy the fact that
you sealed the deal.

93
00:04:28.042 --> 00:04:28.875
(Kennedy laughing)

94
00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.333
- Barely. but thank you.

95
00:04:32.917 --> 00:04:34.167
- Is everything okay?

96
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.917
- Oh. oh. yeah. I'm
sorry about that.

97
00:04:37.042 --> 00:04:38.500
Everything is fine.

98
00:04:38.583 --> 00:04:42.792
It. it's just Zoe freaking
out over nothing again.

99
00:04:42.875 --> 00:04:44.833
She doesn't feel the baby
move for five minutes.

100
00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.250
and she assumes the worst.

101
00:04:46.375 --> 00:04:47.208
- I'm sorry you're
dealing with that.

102
00:04:47.333 --> 00:04:48.667
- I mean. I get it.

103
00:04:48.792 --> 00:04:51.333
everything that happened
last year with a miscarriage.

104
00:04:51.417 --> 00:04:52.833
I'm scared. too.

105
00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:57.292
It just seems like the closer
we get to the due date.

106
00:04:57.375 --> 00:04:59.875
the more worried she becomes.

107
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.667
- Megan. the woman who had
your job before you joined us

108
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.458
this year. was dealing
with something similar.

109
00:05:04.542 --> 00:05:07.833
She actually left to
focus on her new family.

110
00:05:07.875 --> 00:05:09.792
- Oh. I won't be leaving.

111
00:05:09.875 --> 00:05:11.000
Trust me.

112
00:05:11.083 --> 00:05:13.208
This job is way too
important to me.

113
00:05:13.292 --> 00:05:15.125
We'll figure it out.

114
00:05:15.208 --> 00:05:18.417
Zoe's adjusting. right?

115
00:05:20.208 --> 00:05:21.333
Oh. thank you.

116
00:05:21.375 --> 00:05:23.333
(box thudding)

117
00:05:23.417 --> 00:05:24.583
- Hey.
- Mm-hmm?

118
00:05:24.583 --> 00:05:25.500
- Why don't you go
stay at my cabin

119
00:05:25.583 --> 00:05:26.917
in Wildwood this weekend?

120
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.167
You know. I go up most weekends.

121
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.125
but I'm staying in
the Bay this week.

122
00:05:30.208 --> 00:05:31.583
Have a little getaway with Zoe.

123
00:05:31.708 --> 00:05:34.375
Enjoy yourself. you know.
before things really pick up

124
00:05:34.375 --> 00:05:37.083
with the Maury account
and the baby arriving.

125
00:05:37.167 --> 00:05:38.750
- Hmm. Wildwood.

126
00:05:38.875 --> 00:05:39.625
Where's that?

127
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.917
- It's up north. super remote.

128
00:05:42.042 --> 00:05:43.000
It's beautiful.

129
00:05:43.083 --> 00:05:43.833
I promise.

130
00:05:45.042 --> 00:05:46.250
- I don't know.

131
00:05:46.375 --> 00:05:47.750
There's already so
much to do here.

132
00:05:47.833 --> 00:05:49.167
And what if something comes
up with the Maury account?

133
00:05:49.292 --> 00:05:52.875
- I think this is what's best
for you and for the company.

134
00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:53.958
You know. they say

135
00:05:54.042 --> 00:05:55.750
that healthy breaks
increase productivity.

136
00:05:55.833 --> 00:05:58.042
and we both know that
you don't take those.

137
00:05:58.167 --> 00:05:59.833
Plus. if Zoe's feeling better.

138
00:05:59.833 --> 00:06:02.792
then we'll have less
distractions like
we had today. right?

139
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.250
- 'Kay.

140
00:06:06.333 --> 00:06:07.042
- Think about it.

141
00:06:08.208 --> 00:06:09.333
Have a good night.

142
00:06:09.417 --> 00:06:15.000
(footsteps plodding)
(pensive music)

143
00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:17.750
(crickets chirping)

144
00:06:17.833 --> 00:06:20.583
(door clattering)

145
00:06:28.042 --> 00:06:29.667
- Hey.

146
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:30.208
(keys jangling)

147
00:06:30.292 --> 00:06:31.125
- Hey.

148
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.708
- I'm so sorry about work today.

149
00:06:35.833 --> 00:06:39.333
I. I. I realized that
I've been sleeping

150
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.750
on my back sometimes. and
that increases your risk

151
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.750
of a stillbirth. and when
I didn't feel her kick.

152
00:06:45.833 --> 00:06:47.167
I just thought-

153
00:06:47.292 --> 00:06:50.375
- And do you know what else
probably increases that risk?

154
00:06:51.333 --> 00:06:52.417
- What?

155
00:06:52.417 --> 00:06:54.167
- Stress.

156
00:06:54.208 --> 00:06:55.625
(Zoe sighing)

157
00:06:55.708 --> 00:06:57.333
- I know you're probably right.

158
00:06:57.375 --> 00:06:58.625
I'm. I'm sorry.

159
00:07:00.375 --> 00:07:01.667
Listen.

160
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.250
I hope I didn't
ruin things at work.

161
00:07:04.375 --> 00:07:08.042
- No. I sealed the deal.

162
00:07:08.125 --> 00:07:09.167
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

163
00:07:09.167 --> 00:07:10.333
(Zoe gasps)

164
00:07:10.417 --> 00:07:11.375
- Oh. my God.
(Kennedy laughing)

165
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.875
This is amazing.

166
00:07:14.708 --> 00:07:17.500
Why don't you get into this bed

167
00:07:17.583 --> 00:07:20.042
so that we can
properly celebrate?

168
00:07:20.125 --> 00:07:21.625
(Kennedy laughing)

169
00:07:21.708 --> 00:07:23.792
- Uh. I just have to send
a few emails first. 'kay?

170
00:07:26.333 --> 00:07:28.792
(Zoe exhales)

171
00:07:30.292 --> 00:07:32.208
- Come on. it's gotta
be. like. 10:00.

172
00:07:32.292 --> 00:07:34.583
Can answer tomorrow.
(laptop clanking)

173
00:07:34.667 --> 00:07:36.500
- It'll just take a few minutes.

174
00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.792
- You know. I used to have
to stop you from attacking me

175
00:07:42.875 --> 00:07:44.167
with kisses when you got home.

176
00:07:44.292 --> 00:07:46.375
- I have to answer them.

177
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.708
You know how it is.

178
00:07:52.542 --> 00:07:53.583
(fingers tapping)

179
00:07:53.708 --> 00:07:54.417
- Okay.

180
00:07:55.625 --> 00:07:57.833
Get some sleep. all right?
- Mm-hmm.

181
00:07:59.208 --> 00:08:00.792
- Good night.
- Mm-hmm.

182
00:08:02.583 --> 00:08:05.875
(fingers tapping)

183
00:08:05.875 --> 00:08:08.542
(Zoe grunts)

184
00:08:08.667 --> 00:08:09.500
(switch clicking)

185
00:08:09.583 --> 00:08:12.458
(fingers tapping)

186
00:08:18.375 --> 00:08:19.292
(upbeat music)

187
00:08:19.375 --> 00:08:21.042
♪ Oh

188
00:08:27.083 --> 00:08:30.875
- Like. I know I'm carrying
the baby. but I didn't feel

189
00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.875
like I'd be dealing with
the pregnancy alone.

190
00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.250
And then every time I
get emotional about it.

191
00:08:36.333 --> 00:08:38.125
she just tells me to chill out.

192
00:08:38.208 --> 00:08:40.708
- Zo. your tears haven't even
been dried from you crying

193
00:08:40.792 --> 00:08:43.000
over this place not having
your favorite ice cream flavor.

194
00:08:43.083 --> 00:08:45.000
- Adam. you're supposed
to be on my side.

195
00:08:45.042 --> 00:08:46.042
- I am.

196
00:08:46.125 --> 00:08:47.542
Believe me.

197
00:08:47.625 --> 00:08:49.792
And Kennedy and I have
obviously never seen eye to eye.

198
00:08:49.875 --> 00:08:51.625
- Well. that's
because you got drunk.

199
00:08:51.708 --> 00:08:53.000
You called her a bitch.

200
00:08:53.042 --> 00:08:54.667
- Because she said I was
too much for everyone.

201
00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:57.250
- Listen. all I'm saying is.
by the time this baby comes.

202
00:08:57.333 --> 00:08:58.958
we have to be a team.

203
00:08:59.042 --> 00:09:00.250
- You are valid.

204
00:09:00.333 --> 00:09:02.750
You are quite literally carrying
the weight of this alone.

205
00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:04.208
- Exactly.

206
00:09:04.292 --> 00:09:06.250
Every morning I
wake up terrified

207
00:09:06.333 --> 00:09:07.917
that I'm gonna
lose my baby again.

208
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.167
(hands thudding)

209
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.333
- Hmm. look at me.

210
00:09:12.417 --> 00:09:13.125
You won't.

211
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:17.667
'Kay?

212
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:22.000
- Ever since we started
trying again. it's like.

213
00:09:22.083 --> 00:09:24.500
I. I don't even know if
Kennedy's into me anymore.

214
00:09:24.583 --> 00:09:27.167
It feels like the love is jaded.

215
00:09:27.292 --> 00:09:29.375
- Look. it's probably
just the stress right now.

216
00:09:29.458 --> 00:09:31.375
And also. Kennedy
is not the most free

217
00:09:31.458 --> 00:09:33.125
and passionate
person in general.

218
00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:34.583
- She was with me.

219
00:09:34.708 --> 00:09:37.667
- Okay. girl. if you
say so. (laughing)

220
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:41.792
- Okay. how is the love
quest going over there?

221
00:09:41.875 --> 00:09:46.625
- Um. I feel like I'm in the
movie "50 First Dates" a week.

222
00:09:47.583 --> 00:09:48.417
- That bad?

223
00:09:48.542 --> 00:09:50.333
- Mm. it's not terrible.

224
00:09:50.417 --> 00:09:51.833
I just never feel a spark.

225
00:09:53.708 --> 00:09:54.500
- Could write about it.

226
00:09:54.667 --> 00:09:55.708
- Oh. I have.

227
00:09:55.833 --> 00:09:57.833
I'm working on a
piece right now called

228
00:09:57.917 --> 00:10:00.833
"Save Me from Hinge.
I'm Begging You."

229
00:10:02.208 --> 00:10:03.000
You like it?

230
00:10:03.042 --> 00:10:04.250
(both laughing)

231
00:10:04.333 --> 00:10:05.875
- That's good.
- Zoe?

232
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
- Oh. my gosh.
Kaylee. how are you?

233
00:10:09.083 --> 00:10:10.458
- I'm doing great.

234
00:10:10.542 --> 00:10:11.750
Hi.
- Hi.

235
00:10:11.875 --> 00:10:13.667
- But look at you.
(Zoe laughs)

236
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.417
Oh. and you got
the sweet vanilla.

237
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.292
- Yes.
- When's your due date?

238
00:10:17.375 --> 00:10:18.667
- Just a couple weeks now.

239
00:10:18.792 --> 00:10:20.000
How are your kids?

240
00:10:20.083 --> 00:10:22.083
- They're doing
great. thanks to you.

241
00:10:22.167 --> 00:10:24.167
Little one's just
started first grade.

242
00:10:24.208 --> 00:10:25.708
- [Zoe] That's amazing.

243
00:10:25.833 --> 00:10:27.958
- Is this dad?
(Adam laughing)

244
00:10:28.042 --> 00:10:32.167
- Um. no. but yes.
(laughing) but no.

245
00:10:32.208 --> 00:10:35.333
Okay. Kaylee. this is
my best friend. Adam.

246
00:10:35.458 --> 00:10:37.125
Adam. Kaylee. uh. he's-

247
00:10:37.208 --> 00:10:40.167
- The biological donor. but
I'm planning on taking on.

248
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:42.833
like. a uncle role where
I show up. I hang out.

249
00:10:42.875 --> 00:10:45.542
and I leave when the
baby start crying.

250
00:10:45.625 --> 00:10:46.333
- Oh. that's right.

251
00:10:46.417 --> 00:10:47.208
You have a wife.

252
00:10:47.292 --> 00:10:48.000
- I do.

253
00:10:49.708 --> 00:10:51.833
- So how. how do you
two know each other?

254
00:10:51.917 --> 00:10:54.875
- Oh. uh. we worked
together at the non-profit

255
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.208
before the. well. before this.

256
00:10:57.292 --> 00:11:00.583
- She changed my life. helped
me get back on my feet.

257
00:11:00.583 --> 00:11:01.333
- That's my bestie.

258
00:11:01.417 --> 00:11:02.500
(Zoe laughing)

259
00:11:02.542 --> 00:11:03.667
- Well. I'll see
you around. Zoe.

260
00:11:03.792 --> 00:11:04.875
- It was really
great to see you.

261
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.250
- You too.

262
00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:07.083
Bye.
- Bye.

263
00:11:09.042 --> 00:11:11.125
Oh.

264
00:11:11.208 --> 00:11:14.000
So you're lonely and sad
because you miss helping people.

265
00:11:15.375 --> 00:11:18.250
- Hmm. yeah. maybe.

266
00:11:18.375 --> 00:11:20.708
- Look. maybe you can work
part-time after the baby

267
00:11:20.833 --> 00:11:24.792
and have Kennedy take
a few days off a week.

268
00:11:24.875 --> 00:11:26.542
- Hell no. she's never
gonna go for that.

269
00:11:26.625 --> 00:11:28.792
She just got a huge.
new tech client.

270
00:11:28.875 --> 00:11:30.917
It's gonna take
even more time away.

271
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.500
- Well. your goals
are valid. too.

272
00:11:32.583 --> 00:11:35.333
- Oh. you're right.

273
00:11:35.458 --> 00:11:37.292
I know.

274
00:11:37.375 --> 00:11:39.667
- I can't believe she
thought I was straight.

275
00:11:39.667 --> 00:11:40.417
Do I look
(Zoe sighs)

276
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.708
straight to strangers?

277
00:11:41.833 --> 00:11:43.792
Is that why I can't
get a meet-cute?

278
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:45.667
- I mean.

279
00:11:46.708 --> 00:11:48.125
- Oh. come.

280
00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:50.500
- Maybe lose a
button. (laughing)

281
00:11:50.542 --> 00:11:51.417
- A button?

282
00:11:53.125 --> 00:11:55.083

it up like this.

getting away this weekend?

- Where?

293
00:12:24.375 --> 00:12:26.542
- My boss offered up
his cabin in this town

up north called Wildwood.

295
00:12:28.208 --> 00:12:29.375

296
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:31.042

about it. and you know.

297
00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:33.958
this is really our last chance
to have some time together

know we're going.

I'd say two weeks from now.

311
00:13:01.292 --> 00:13:02.750
So we can talk more
about it later.

312
00:13:02.833 --> 00:13:05.833

when I turned to leave.

she was just watching me.

406

- Oh. okay. that's
pretty creepy.

407
00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.708
but I'm sure she's harmless.

408
00:18:16.583 --> 00:18:18.375
- You're probably right.

409
00:18:18.458 --> 00:18:20.833
She did say that the town
was full of hippies. though.

410
00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:24.292
- [Kennedy] Hmm. well. hippies
are nice people. right?

411
00:18:24.375 --> 00:18:26.250
- Yeah.

412
00:18:26.333 --> 00:18:29.750
Oh. and apparently there
is a retreat and a spa.

413
00:18:29.833 --> 00:18:31.083
- Well. that sounds perfect.

415
00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:35.292

I'm gonna go connect
to the Wi-Fi.

unpack the bags myself.

right back. okay?

444

of this trip was

445
00:20:50.458 --> 00:20:52.333
so that you connect with us.

446
00:20:52.458 --> 00:20:54.375
- I said I'll be right back.

447
00:20:54.458 --> 00:20:57.667
and I will bring
in all the bags.

448

00:25:24.917 --> 00:25:27.917
- Babe. (sighs) you can't let
people like that get to you.

540
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.792
- What if she tries to
kill us in the middle

541
00:25:29.875 --> 00:25:31.667
of the night or something?

542
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:35.042
- Well. it seems
like the sheriff was
taking care of things.

543
00:25:35.125 --> 00:25:36.875
- I don't know how I'm
gonna sleep knowing

544
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.042
that that crazy lady
is anywhere nearby.

545
00:25:40.125 --> 00:25:42.833
- Uh. I'm pretty sure Robert
actually has an alarm system.

546
00:25:42.958 --> 00:25:45.708
so we'll just make
sure it's set. okay?

547
00:25:47.375 --> 00:25:48.708
- I don't know. Kennedy.

548
00:25:48.875 --> 00:25:52.333
- Look. she's just a
disturbed. bigoted woman.

549
00:25:52.417 --> 00:25:54.375
We've dealt with judgment
in our relationship before.

550
00:25:54.458 --> 00:25:55.833
This is nothing new.

551
00:25:55.875 --> 00:26:00.667
We'll just stick to
ourselves. and we'll be fine.

552
00:26:02.542 --> 00:26:05.917
(mellow music continues)

553
00:26:09.792 --> 00:26:11.375
(seat belt clanking)

554
00:26:11.458 --> 00:26:16.208
(birds squawking)
(animal howling)

555
00:26:18.167 --> 00:26:20.250
(Zoe exhaling)

556
00:26:20.333 --> 00:26:21.875
- This is so peaceful.

557
00:26:21.958 --> 00:26:22.667
- Mm.

558
00:26:28.083 --> 00:26:32.000
(notification chiming)

559
00:26:32.083 --> 00:26:33.417
(cup thudding)

560
00:26:33.542 --> 00:26:35.667
(pensive music)

561
00:26:35.708 --> 00:26:36.958
(cup thudding)

562
00:26:37.042 --> 00:26:38.708
Hey. hey. hey. hey.
where are you going?

563
00:26:38.792 --> 00:26:40.417
- Inside to be alone.

564
00:26:40.542 --> 00:26:41.708
- Why?

565
00:26:41.792 --> 00:26:43.417
- Because it is
lonelier out here.

566
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:44.333
- [Kennedy] Zo. come on. you-

567
00:26:44.417 --> 00:26:46.833
- Do you always have to respond?

568
00:26:46.958 --> 00:26:49.000
- Okay. look. I'll
put it away. okay?

569
00:26:49.125 --> 00:26:50.458
I'm done. Sit down.

570
00:26:50.542 --> 00:26:51.667
- I don't believe you.

571
00:26:51.792 --> 00:26:54.333
- Please. please. please. baby.

572
00:26:54.417 --> 00:26:56.458
Stay. Sit.

573
00:26:56.542 --> 00:26:57.958
(leaves rustling)
(birds squawking)

574
00:26:58.042 --> 00:27:00.083
- [Zoe] What the hell is that?
(suspenseful music)

575
00:27:00.167 --> 00:27:05.125
(leaves rustling)
(birds squawking)

576
00:27:10.167 --> 00:27:13.000
(footsteps plodding)

577
00:27:15.292 --> 00:27:16.542
(woman laughing)

578
00:27:16.708 --> 00:27:17.833
- We're sorry.

579
00:27:17.917 --> 00:27:19.208
We didn't mean to
sneak up on you.

580
00:27:19.292 --> 00:27:21.500
We just. we saw the fire.
and well. we thought

581
00:27:21.583 --> 00:27:23.750
we'd just drop in and
welcome you to Wildwood.

582
00:27:23.833 --> 00:27:28.833
- Oh. great. (laughs) thank you.

583
00:27:31.042 --> 00:27:33.792
- We. uh. we brought
some. some herbs

584
00:27:33.875 --> 00:27:34.750
from our communal garden.

585
00:27:34.833 --> 00:27:36.333
They're for prenatal support.

586
00:27:36.375 --> 00:27:38.917
We heard you had some trouble
finding vitamins in the store.

587
00:27:39.042 --> 00:27:40.833
- Uh. is it okay
if I have these?

588
00:27:40.917 --> 00:27:42.917
- Oh. yes. of. of course.

589
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.542
Uh. uh. Penny has actually
been a midwife for 20 years.

590
00:27:46.667 --> 00:27:49.208
She's delivered most of
the babies in this town.

591
00:27:49.292 --> 00:27:54.125
including my daughter. which
was a very complicated birth.

592
00:27:54.208 --> 00:27:54.917
- [Penny] Mm.

593
00:27:56.542 --> 00:27:58.500
- Well. maybe you
can put Zoe's mind

594
00:27:58.625 --> 00:28:00.500
at ease about a few things.

595
00:28:00.542 --> 00:28:02.375
Uh. she thinks
something is wrong

596
00:28:02.458 --> 00:28:04.667
with this baby
every five seconds.

597
00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:07.750
- That is totally normal.

598
00:28:07.875 --> 00:28:09.917
But if you have any
questions while you're here.

599
00:28:10.042 --> 00:28:12.625
I'm. I'm happy to
give you any answers

600
00:28:12.708 --> 00:28:14.375
that could be of any help.

601
00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:15.375
- We're good. thanks.

602
00:28:18.667 --> 00:28:22.708
- We also wanted to.
um. just apologize

603
00:28:22.708 --> 00:28:24.917
for what happened
in town with Carla.

604
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.750
That was completely
unacceptable.

605
00:28:26.833 --> 00:28:28.542
- We are so sorry.

606
00:28:28.625 --> 00:28:31.167
- It was definitely unsettling.

607
00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:33.083
- Well. if you are
worried about something

608
00:28:33.167 --> 00:28:36.875
like that happening again. let
me assure you. it will not.

609
00:28:43.333 --> 00:28:47.708
So you guys. you must be
friends of Robert's. right?

610
00:28:47.792 --> 00:28:50.875
- He's actually my boss.
and. uh. he was nice enough

611
00:28:50.958 --> 00:28:53.625
to let us come up here
for a little getaway.

612
00:28:53.708 --> 00:28:55.042
- Oh.
- Right. babe?

613
00:28:55.167 --> 00:28:57.583
- Well. it's nice to see
his cabin going good use

614
00:28:57.667 --> 00:28:59.083
while he's gone.

615
00:28:59.208 --> 00:29:03.167
It's really nice to see
fresh faces in town.

616
00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:06.167
- How long have you
guys lived here?

617
00:29:06.208 --> 00:29:10.458
- Um. well. uh. I've
lived here all my life.

618
00:29:10.542 --> 00:29:12.333
Um. used to be a
thriving community

619
00:29:12.417 --> 00:29:14.250
till the mine shut down
about 50 years ago.

620
00:29:14.333 --> 00:29:17.333
- Oh. yeah. we. uh. saw
those when we drove in.

621
00:29:17.417 --> 00:29:19.333
They looked pretty. uh. scary.
(pensive music)

622
00:29:19.458 --> 00:29:22.000
- It is.
- It's very dangerous.

623
00:29:22.042 --> 00:29:26.125
- Under no circumstances
is anybody allowed inside.

624
00:29:26.208 --> 00:29:29.042
But I'm happy to give you a
tour of our little sanctuary

625
00:29:29.125 --> 00:29:30.750
if you're feeling up to
it while you're here.

626
00:29:30.833 --> 00:29:33.083
- Uh. sure. thank you.

627
00:29:33.208 --> 00:29:36.208
- Great. perfect. perfect.
I will hold you to it.

628
00:29:36.333 --> 00:29:37.250
(Penny laughing)

629
00:29:37.333 --> 00:29:39.833
(Amy laughing)

630
00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:44.250
Well. it was really
lovely to meet you both.

631
00:29:44.333 --> 00:29:44.958
Take care.

632
00:29:46.417 --> 00:29:47.125
- Night.
- Bye.

633
00:29:49.708 --> 00:29:50.417
- Bye.

634
00:29:52.042 --> 00:29:53.500
Oh. there's so many of them.

635
00:29:54.792 --> 00:29:56.125
Look at that.

636
00:29:56.208 --> 00:29:57.458
It's kinda cute.

637
00:29:57.542 --> 00:30:00.083
- What did you just get us into?

638
00:30:05.292 --> 00:30:08.125
(water sloshing)

639
00:30:08.125 --> 00:30:10.917
Why did they all come out
of the woods like that.

640
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.833
and why were they all
smiling that creepy smile?

641
00:30:14.875 --> 00:30:17.583
- Oh. I don't know.
because they're happy?

642
00:30:17.667 --> 00:30:20.167
They probably walk on each
other's properties all the time.

643
00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:21.542
You know?

644
00:30:21.625 --> 00:30:24.875
I doubt there's much crime
up here to be scared of.

645
00:30:24.958 --> 00:30:26.542
- Well. I grew up
in the suburbs.

646
00:30:26.667 --> 00:30:29.333
and if anybody just showed
up in the backyard like that.

647
00:30:29.417 --> 00:30:31.750
it's pretty safe to
assume they're unhinged.

648
00:30:31.833 --> 00:30:34.375
- Babe. we're from the city.

649
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:41.000
Yeah. you're from the suburbs
but no place rural like this.

650
00:30:41.042 --> 00:30:44.875
Uh. they just. uh. seem like
a really close community.

651
00:30:44.958 --> 00:30:47.500
- Mm. oh. too close.

652
00:30:47.542 --> 00:30:49.333
(hand pounding)
(dramatic music)

653
00:30:54.375 --> 00:30:55.500
- Oh. (exhales)

654
00:30:55.583 --> 00:30:56.708
(door clattering)

655
00:30:56.792 --> 00:30:57.958
- Hi.
- Hi.

656
00:30:58.042 --> 00:30:59.833
- Sorry. I just. I
forgot to tell you guys

657
00:30:59.958 --> 00:31:01.167
something really important.

658
00:31:05.042 --> 00:31:08.250
We're doing yoga
tomorrow at the park.

659
00:31:08.333 --> 00:31:11.208
and we'd love for
you guys to join us.

660
00:31:11.292 --> 00:31:13.458
- I don't know
if. (laughing) um-

661
00:31:13.542 --> 00:31:15.083
- Oh. no. no. it's actually
really. really good

662
00:31:15.167 --> 00:31:17.250
for all the baby
aches and pains.

663
00:31:17.333 --> 00:31:19.542
- Well. in that
case. we'll be there.

664
00:31:19.625 --> 00:31:20.458
- Great.
- Thanks.

665
00:31:20.458 --> 00:31:22.375
- Okay. good night now.

666
00:31:22.375 --> 00:31:23.542
- Bye.

667
00:31:23.625 --> 00:31:26.500
(door squeaking and clattering)

668
00:31:26.583 --> 00:31:27.833
- That was creepy.

669
00:31:27.875 --> 00:31:29.583
- Mm. mm. (sighs)

670
00:31:29.667 --> 00:31:31.500
- Why did you say yes?

671
00:31:31.583 --> 00:31:33.875
- Because yoga sounds nice.

672
00:31:33.958 --> 00:31:37.042
We could use a little relaxing.

673
00:31:37.125 --> 00:31:41.167
and maybe you should consider
taking some of these herbs

674
00:31:41.208 --> 00:31:43.000
to de-stress just a little.

675
00:31:43.792 --> 00:31:46.667
- Ugh. I. no.

676
00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:49.625
I. I don't even
know what this is.

677
00:31:49.708 --> 00:31:51.167
There's no labels on some of it.

678
00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:53.708
- (sighs) Well.
Penny's a midwife.

679
00:31:53.792 --> 00:31:56.458
so she knows what
she's doing. right?

680
00:31:56.542 --> 00:31:58.458
- Well. I'm not putting
anything in my body

681
00:31:58.542 --> 00:31:59.750
I don't know what it is.

682
00:31:59.833 --> 00:32:01.875
- All right. look.
let me look it up.

683
00:32:01.958 --> 00:32:03.750
Let's see what we got here.

684
00:32:03.833 --> 00:32:08.875
We have bilberry. supports
healthy capillaries and veins.

685
00:32:10.792 --> 00:32:15.125
and raspberry leaf. boosts iron

686
00:32:15.208 --> 00:32:17.667
and decreases nausea. not bad.

687
00:32:18.792 --> 00:32:20.208
(item clanking)

688
00:32:20.292 --> 00:32:23.958
oat straw. relieves
anxiety and restlessness.

689
00:32:25.208 --> 00:32:27.708
- Okay. that doesn't
sound so bad.

690
00:32:27.833 --> 00:32:30.667
- Mm. sounds exactly
like the prenatals

691
00:32:30.708 --> 00:32:31.917
that you take at home.

692
00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:38.042
- Okay. I will boil
some hot water.

693
00:32:38.167 --> 00:32:39.542
(Kennedy laughing)

694
00:32:39.625 --> 00:32:42.417
- Attagirl. all right. I'm
gonna go hop in the shower.

695
00:32:42.542 --> 00:32:45.042
Enjoy.

00:33:27.042 --> 00:33:29.000
- Okay. I'll be right back.

713
00:33:29.042 --> 00:33:33.417
(phone ringing)

714
00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:39.750
Hey. Zo. I am on a date right
now. and it's going amazing.

715
00:33:39.833 --> 00:33:42.333
- Adam. do you wanna drop
everything and come hang out?

716
00:33:42.417 --> 00:33:44.500
- Girl. did you
not just hear me?

717
00:33:44.542 --> 00:33:45.333
(Zoe sighing)

718
00:33:45.417 --> 00:33:46.167
(Adam sighing)

719
00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:47.250
Why?

720
00:33:47.375 --> 00:33:48.792
- Everyone in the town is weird.

721
00:33:48.875 --> 00:33:51.417
and Kennedy only
cares about work.

722
00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.958
I feel like I'm
all alone up here.

723
00:33:54.042 --> 00:33:56.000
- Well. Kennedy will be pissed.

724
00:33:56.083 --> 00:33:58.333
- [Zoe] Well. that's her fault.

725
00:33:58.375 --> 00:34:00.750
- Well. I'm kinda in the
middle of something good here.

726
00:34:00.833 --> 00:34:01.625
- Come on.

727
00:34:01.708 --> 00:34:03.167
I just have a feeling.

728
00:34:03.208 --> 00:34:05.500
- [Adam] There you go with
your suspicious feelings.

729
00:34:05.583 --> 00:34:07.875
- [Zoe] I mean it. I
would feel a lot better

730
00:34:07.958 --> 00:34:09.000
if you were around.

731
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:13.417
(Adam sighing)

732
00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:16.417
- Mm. look. a free
getaway does sound nice.

733
00:34:16.542 --> 00:34:17.583
- [Zoe] Yay.

734
00:34:17.667 --> 00:34:19.000
- (laughing) You know
you're lucky I love you.

735
00:34:19.083 --> 00:34:19.958
- I'll see you soon.

736
00:34:20.042 --> 00:34:20.667
Have fun.

737
00:34:25.542 --> 00:34:26.750
♪ We got tonight

738
00:34:26.875 --> 00:34:28.958
- Uh. everything okay?

739
00:34:28.958 --> 00:34:30.500
- Yeah. it's just
my. my best friend.

740
00:34:30.583 --> 00:34:35.042
She's having an emergency.
so I'm sorry. I. I gotta go.

741
00:34:35.125 --> 00:34:37.500
- Look. if you're not
having a good time.

742
00:34:37.625 --> 00:34:38.625
you could just tell me.

743
00:34:38.708 --> 00:34:40.542
- No. no. no. it.
it's not that at all.

744
00:34:40.667 --> 00:34:44.917
It's just that she needs me.
and it's not a lie this time.

745
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.417
- This time?

746
00:34:46.542 --> 00:34:49.417
- Yeah. I kinda use that
terrible excuse on first dates.

747
00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.458
(date laughing)

748
00:34:51.542 --> 00:34:53.042
But I'm. I'm having
a really great time.

749
00:34:53.167 --> 00:34:54.833
like really great time.

750
00:34:54.958 --> 00:34:55.708
- Me too.

751
00:34:58.125 --> 00:34:59.583
- Can I see you when I get back?

752
00:35:01.042 --> 00:35:01.708
- Definitely.

753
00:35:02.875 --> 00:35:03.583
- Okay.

754
00:35:06.958 --> 00:35:09.583
(lips smacking)

755
00:35:10.875 --> 00:35:13.125
Well. um. um.

756
00:35:13.208 --> 00:35:13.958
(date laughs)

757
00:35:14.042 --> 00:35:16.667
(Adam laughing)

758
00:35:16.708 --> 00:35:18.125
Um.

759
00:35:18.208 --> 00:35:19.125
Bye.
- Bye.

760
00:35:21.208 --> 00:35:22.167
Bye.
- Bye.

761
00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:27.167
(crickets chirping)

762
00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:30.667
(engines humming)

763
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:33.625
(footsteps plodding)

764
00:35:37.083 --> 00:35:40.000
(Kennedy laughing)

765
00:35:40.042 --> 00:35:41.667
(brooding music)

766
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:42.708
- It's just wrong.

767
00:35:44.958 --> 00:35:46.375
- Do you have a problem. ladies?

768
00:35:48.542 --> 00:35:49.250
Good.

769
00:35:51.125 --> 00:35:52.417
(Penny sighs)

770
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:53.750
I am so glad that you
guys decided to come.

771
00:35:53.833 --> 00:35:55.000
Zoe. I have a mat.

772
00:35:55.042 --> 00:35:56.875
It's open for you
right over here.

773
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000
Um. we'll get you all settled.
and comfortable. and cozy.

774
00:36:02.083 --> 00:36:04.833
And then Kennedy. I
have another mat by me

775
00:36:04.917 --> 00:36:06.250
that you're welcome to use.

776
00:36:07.667 --> 00:36:10.208
(gentle music)

777
00:36:15.167 --> 00:36:17.792
(Penny exhales)

778
00:36:17.917 --> 00:36:21.792
So you feel ready
for motherhood?

779
00:36:23.375 --> 00:36:24.208
- Yeah.

780
00:36:26.333 --> 00:36:29.958
- Still. it's gotta
be hard. you know.

781
00:36:30.042 --> 00:36:34.333
considering your
unique circumstances.

782
00:36:34.417 --> 00:36:37.375
- I don't think
they're that unique.

783
00:36:37.458 --> 00:36:40.083
I'm sure Zoe has a lot more
going on than I do right now.

784
00:36:40.167 --> 00:36:43.500
but it's what we
decided would be best.

785
00:36:47.625 --> 00:36:48.708
- Do you think you're
going to be able

786
00:36:48.792 --> 00:36:51.333
to adjust your schedules
once the baby comes?

787
00:36:51.417 --> 00:36:53.292
- I mean. I'll
have to work a lot.

788
00:36:53.375 --> 00:36:59.167
That's unavoidable.
but I'll make time.

789
00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:02.583
- You know a baby needs
more than time. right?

790
00:37:02.708 --> 00:37:07.167
A baby needs ever-present
family and community.

791
00:37:10.458 --> 00:37:11.875
- I know. I'll make it work.

792
00:37:13.167 --> 00:37:14.208
- Of course.

793
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:16.583
Of course. you will.

794
00:37:22.208 --> 00:37:25.042
(Kennedy exhales)

795
00:37:25.125 --> 00:37:28.458
(gentle music continues)

796
00:37:36.792 --> 00:37:37.667
(birds squawking)

797
00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:40.625
(footsteps plodding)

798
00:37:45.208 --> 00:37:46.750
(book clattering)

799
00:37:46.833 --> 00:37:47.750
(Zoe gasps)

800
00:37:47.833 --> 00:37:49.917
(pensive music)

801
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.750
(necklace clanking)

802
00:37:57.125 --> 00:37:58.292
- Who's in ML?

803
00:38:00.417 --> 00:38:03.500
- Hey. Zo. do you know
where the car keys are?

804
00:38:04.875 --> 00:38:05.750
(book thudding)

805
00:38:05.833 --> 00:38:07.708
- Uh. yeah. why?

806
00:38:08.958 --> 00:38:10.792
- Well. uh.

807
00:38:13.708 --> 00:38:15.917
Penny said that
the coffee shop has

808
00:38:16.042 --> 00:38:17.167
the best service in town.

809
00:38:17.292 --> 00:38:21.417
and I have one last
work call to make.

810
00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:23.000
I know. I know. I know. I know.

811
00:38:23.042 --> 00:38:26.667
but I promise this is it. and
then I'm done. no more calls.

812
00:38:28.125 --> 00:38:30.250
I'm really sorry that I've been

813
00:38:30.375 --> 00:38:33.917
so (sighs) out of
touch with us lately.

814
00:38:37.042 --> 00:38:38.333
(keys jangling)

815
00:38:38.375 --> 00:38:41.000
- Really. last?

816
00:38:41.042 --> 00:38:42.000
- Really. really.

817
00:38:42.083 --> 00:38:43.708
(keys jangling)

818
00:38:43.708 --> 00:38:48.500
And look. after this.
it'll be just you and me.

819
00:38:48.583 --> 00:38:53.667
no calls. no distractions.
just you and me.

820
00:38:53.708 --> 00:38:55.000
(lips smacking)

821
00:38:55.083 --> 00:38:56.000
(footsteps plodding)

822
00:38:56.125 --> 00:38:57.542
What? What's that look about?

823
00:38:59.125 --> 00:38:59.875
(footsteps plodding)

824
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:00.792
What is that?

825
00:39:00.875 --> 00:39:01.833
(hand knocking)

826
00:39:01.917 --> 00:39:02.583
- Could be anyone.

827
00:39:04.375 --> 00:39:07.292
(door clattering)

828
00:39:08.875 --> 00:39:10.083
- Oh.

829
00:39:10.167 --> 00:39:11.917
(door clattering)

830
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.208
- Well. hi. Kennedy.

831
00:39:13.292 --> 00:39:17.583
- (sighs) Oh. God. you did this?

832
00:39:17.667 --> 00:39:19.583
- Well. you didn't
wanna hang out with me.

833
00:39:19.708 --> 00:39:23.500
and until five minutes ago.
all you had time for was work.

834
00:39:23.583 --> 00:39:26.917
- So then you went and
invited Adam behind my back?

835
00:39:28.417 --> 00:39:29.458
You're unbelievable.

836
00:39:31.375 --> 00:39:32.833
- Should I go?

837
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.917
- No. you should stay because
Kennedy has another work call

838
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.083
that she has to go take.

839
00:39:37.167 --> 00:39:38.625
- Hmm.
- That's right.

840
00:39:38.708 --> 00:39:41.333
I'll see you later.
hopefully not you.

841
00:39:41.375 --> 00:39:45.875
(door clattering)
(pensive music)

842
00:39:45.958 --> 00:39:47.125
- Sorry.

843
00:39:47.208 --> 00:39:48.333
(Adam laughing)

844
00:39:48.417 --> 00:39:49.625
- You gotta be
sorry. She's gone.

845
00:39:50.958 --> 00:39:52.250
(birds squawking)

846
00:39:52.333 --> 00:39:55.500
Oh. this is cute
in a divorced dad

847
00:39:55.625 --> 00:39:58.667
who just became obsessed
with hiking kind of way.

848
00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:00.625
- Kennedy's boss owns it.
(Adam laughing)

849
00:40:00.708 --> 00:40:02.000
- Mm.

850
00:40:02.083 --> 00:40:07.542
- And I don't think he's single
'cause I found this today.

851
00:40:07.625 --> 00:40:08.625
It's gotta be. like.
a girlfriend's.

852
00:40:08.708 --> 00:40:10.167
or a wife's. or something.

853
00:40:10.292 --> 00:40:11.958
- Oh. he like that?

854
00:40:12.042 --> 00:40:13.458
- We should ask Kennedy.

855
00:40:13.542 --> 00:40:18.083
- Or this is the
side piece cabin.

856
00:40:18.167 --> 00:40:19.542
(Zoe laughing)

857
00:40:19.625 --> 00:40:22.375
- I do not think he'd be
giving his secret affair cabin

858
00:40:22.458 --> 00:40:24.583
away to an employee.

859
00:40:24.667 --> 00:40:27.792
- Well. you think you know
someone. but maybe you don't.

860
00:40:27.875 --> 00:40:28.958
- Okay. you know what?
- Hmm.

861
00:40:29.042 --> 00:40:30.500
- This is why I'm so
happy that you're here.

862
00:40:30.542 --> 00:40:32.292
someone as paranoid as me.

863
00:40:32.375 --> 00:40:35.625
- Girl. do not put me in the
same category as crazy as you.

864
00:40:35.708 --> 00:40:39.000
- First of all. if you saw
a group of people coming

865
00:40:39.083 --> 00:40:40.583
out of the woods towards you.

866
00:40:40.667 --> 00:40:43.000
you would be just as
freaked out as I am.

867
00:40:43.042 --> 00:40:44.625
- Not the woods. (laughs)

868
00:40:44.708 --> 00:40:48.167
- All dressed the same. all
with the same creepy smile.

869
00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:50.458
I'm. I think the
whole town's. like.

870
00:40:50.542 --> 00:40:52.667
part of the same
commune or something.

871
00:40:52.708 --> 00:40:56.417
- Okay. so they're weird. but
what's got my girl unsettled?

872
00:40:57.458 --> 00:40:59.333
- Something is off.

873
00:40:59.458 --> 00:41:02.000
- Got this feeling.
the Zoe hunch?

874
00:41:02.083 --> 00:41:03.042
(hand knocking)

875
00:41:07.708 --> 00:41:09.833
- Oh. my God. that's her.
(pensive music)

876
00:41:09.917 --> 00:41:12.708
What do I do?
- Um. answer the door?

877
00:41:14.042 --> 00:41:15.167
- Okay. you know what?

878
00:41:15.208 --> 00:41:16.083
You're gonna see.

879
00:41:19.292 --> 00:41:21.333
(footsteps plodding)

880
00:41:21.417 --> 00:41:22.833
(door clattering)

881
00:41:22.875 --> 00:41:25.833
- Hi. (laughs)

882
00:41:25.833 --> 00:41:28.667
Wow. don't you
just look radiant.

883
00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:32.125
Oh.
- Come on in.

884
00:41:32.208 --> 00:41:35.708
- Um. wow. hi. uh. who are you?

885
00:41:37.458 --> 00:41:38.250
- Um. (laughs)

886
00:41:38.333 --> 00:41:41.333
- Oh. okay. well.

887
00:41:41.417 --> 00:41:43.000
(Zoe grunting)

888
00:41:43.042 --> 00:41:46.667
this is Adam. my best friend.
also the donor of our baby.

889
00:41:46.708 --> 00:41:51.000
- Oh. how wonderful. oh.
what a wonderful surprise.

890
00:41:51.083 --> 00:41:53.000

How. how are you feeling?

00:41:57.542 --> 00:41:59.000
- Oh. better. thank you.

895
00:41:59.083 --> 00:42:01.500
- Good. good.

896
00:42:01.583 --> 00:42:04.125
Well. I. uh. I just.
uh. stopped by to see

897
00:42:04.208 --> 00:42:06.167
if maybe you were up for that
tour. and then we could pop

898
00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:08.167
by the wellness center
for a little relaxation.

899
00:42:08.250 --> 00:42:09.750
But you know what?

900
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:12.375
Why don't you both come?

901
00:42:12.458 --> 00:42:14.625
- I mean. I could
desperately use a spa day.

902
00:42:14.708 --> 00:42:16.458
- I couldn't go without Kennedy.

903
00:42:16.542 --> 00:42:17.500
(Adam scoffs)

904
00:42:17.583 --> 00:42:19.875

905
00:42:19.958 --> 00:42:22.667
Girl. I'll be your
Kennedy today.

906
00:42:22.708 --> 00:42:24.708
- Great. it won't take long.

907
00:42:26.458 --> 00:42:29.625
- Okay. fine. let's go.

908
00:42:29.708 --> 00:42:31.500
I just need to go
upstairs. grab my bag.

909
00:42:31.583 --> 00:42:32.417
I'll meet you guys outside.

910
00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:33.625

911
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:35.833
I'm so excited that you came.

912
00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:39.792
- [Adam] Girl.
(Penny exhales)

913
00:42:39.875 --> 00:42:41.417
- [Penny] When was the last
time you had a spa day?

914
00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:43.125
- [Adam] A long time.

915
00:42:46.125 --> 00:42:48.875

924

- So this is it.

925
00:43:32.875 --> 00:43:36.583
We're completely
self-sustainable.
and here in our farm.

926
00:43:36.667 --> 00:43:38.833
we grow pretty much
anything that we would need.

927
00:43:38.917 --> 00:43:41.542
- Why do they all have
the same hairstyle?

928
00:43:41.625 --> 00:43:44.917
- It's very cult
cultural. (laughs)

929
00:43:53.625 --> 00:43:55.083
- And this is our
medicinal garden

930
00:43:55.167 --> 00:43:57.250
where we grow all of
our healing herbs.

931
00:43:57.333 --> 00:43:58.125
In fact.

932
00:44:01.208 --> 00:44:02.958
(plant rustling)

933
00:44:03.042 --> 00:44:05.125
here. try some.

934
00:44:06.333 --> 00:44:07.667
- Like. just eat it?

935
00:44:07.708 --> 00:44:10.167
- Yeah. that's how you
reap the most nutrients.

936
00:44:10.292 --> 00:44:11.667
- Well. what is it?

937
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:13.083
- Oh. it's the same prenatal
stuff that we gave you

938
00:44:13.208 --> 00:44:16.375
when you got here. only this.
this is fresh off the vine.

939
00:44:16.458 --> 00:44:17.583
- Oh.
- Mm.

940
00:44:17.708 --> 00:44:18.625

Okay. not bad.
- Right?

943

It's. uh. like magic.

(footsteps plodding)
(pensive music continues)

945

- Hey. Penny. gonna
show us the mine. too?

946
00:44:45.375 --> 00:44:47.917
- No. it's forbidden.

947
00:44:51.792 --> 00:44:52.917
What would you guys
say about joining me

948
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.167
at the wellness center
for a little relaxation?

949
00:44:56.333 --> 00:44:57.500

- It has been quite
a while. actually.

969
00:45:51.708 --> 00:45:54.125

is our gift to you.

970

971

986

this account anymore.

991

992
00:46:42.417 --> 00:46:43.250

I am always on top of things.

1000

phone service.

1001

1002
00:47:03.333 --> 00:47:06.667
- Oh. okay. then
what was the problem?

1003
00:47:06.708 --> 00:47:07.917
- [Tanya] I don't know.

1004
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.375
The call came from
your own company.

1005

All right.

1068
00:51:02.917 --> 00:51:06.042

1069
00:51:06.125 --> 00:51:09.667

Um. uh. my car's not starting.

1090
00:52:07.208 --> 00:52:08.625
- Oh. no. you want me
to give you a ride back?

1091
00:52:08.708 --> 00:52:10.250
- That would be
amazing. thank you.

1092
00:52:10.375 --> 00:52:11.375

(door clattering)

1097
00:52:21.875 --> 00:52:22.833
- Oh. you know what?

1098
00:52:22.875 --> 00:52:24.167
Actually. I forgot my bag.

1099
00:52:24.250 --> 00:52:25.958
Just hang on a sec.

1100
00:52:26.042 --> 00:52:26.750

We're in a cabin

- Yeah. I know the one.

1112

Actually. I think

(latch clicking)

1124
00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:06.583
Brought you some tea.

1125
00:54:07.875 --> 00:54:10.375
- Oh. my head is killing me.

1126
00:54:10.458 --> 00:54:12.167

1130
00:54:23.167 --> 00:54:24.000
Oh. oh.

1131
00:54:25.625 --> 00:54:26.833
- What is it?

1132
00:54:26.917 --> 00:54:29.375
(Zoe gasping)

1133
00:54:34.417 --> 00:54:36.458
- My water just broke.

1134
00:54:36.542 --> 00:54:37.625
- [Penny] Yes. it did.

1135
00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:42.792
- Are you going to turn around?

1136
00:54:45.292 --> 00:54:50.875
Can you. (sighs)
can you turn around?

1137
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.500
I need you to stop. I
need you to stop the car.

1138
00:54:54.875 --> 00:54:56.250
Jim. can you stop the car?

1139
00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:58.792
Let me out.

1140

I need to. I need to get out.

1141
00:55:06.125 --> 00:55:07.542
Can you let me out?

1142
00:55:10.708 --> 00:55:16.292
Please.
(brooding music continues)

1143
00:55:16.375 --> 00:55:17.208
- Where's Adam?

1144
00:55:17.292 --> 00:55:18.833
I need to get to Kennedy.

1145
00:55:18.917 --> 00:55:20.542
- Sh. sh. sh. sh. sh. no.
no. no. no. don't stress.

1146
00:55:21.958 --> 00:55:23.417
- I've never been more stressed.

1147
00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:26.333
- Just calm down.

1148
00:55:26.417 --> 00:55:27.750
I am a midwife.

1149
00:55:27.875 --> 00:55:29.542
I will take care of you.

1150
00:55:29.667 --> 00:55:30.833
- I need to get to the hospital.

1151
00:55:30.875 --> 00:55:32.500
- You just need to
sit down and breathe.

1152
00:55:32.625 --> 00:55:36.333
- No. I need to find Kennedy.
(door clattering)

1153
00:55:36.458 --> 00:55:37.500
Let go of me.
(suspenseful music)

1154
00:55:37.542 --> 00:55:39.417
- Okay.
- Let go of me.

1155
00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:40.542
What are you doing?

1156
00:55:40.625 --> 00:55:42.375
Let go of me. Let go.

1157
00:55:42.375 --> 00:55:44.333
- Get down.
- Hold her.

1158
00:55:44.417 --> 00:55:46.583
- Isn't the power of the
plants just miraculous?

1159
00:55:47.958 --> 00:55:49.375
- What did you put in that tea?

1160
00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:51.000
- Just the same herbs
that I've been giving you

1161
00:55:51.125 --> 00:55:52.208
the last few days.

1162
00:55:52.292 --> 00:55:52.958
- You induced me.

1163
00:55:54.333 --> 00:55:56.833
Why?
- Sh. sh. sh. sh.

1164
00:55:56.917 --> 00:55:58.000
This'll all be over soon.

1165
00:55:59.208 --> 00:56:00.333
- Adam. help.

1166
00:56:01.792 --> 00:56:03.208

1169
00:56:07.875 --> 00:56:10.667

(unit beeping)

1171
00:56:13.542 --> 00:56:14.750
I don't wanna die naked.

1172
00:56:16.250 --> 00:56:19.750
- No. I need Kennedy. (groaning)

1173
00:56:20.875 --> 00:56:21.708
Please.

1174
00:56:21.792 --> 00:56:24.708
- Zoe. I need you to calm down.

1175
00:56:24.833 --> 00:56:26.167
You're gonna breathe
through this. okay?

1176
00:56:26.292 --> 00:56:30.542
I need you to breathe through
this. (breathing deeply)

1177
00:56:32.792 --> 00:56:36.000
Come on. girls.
(breathing deeply)

1178
00:56:37.083 --> 00:56:38.000
That's it.

1179
00:56:38.042 --> 00:56:40.500
(Zoe moaning)

1180
00:56:43.208 --> 00:56:45.875
- Let's go now.
- That's it. Zoe.

1181
00:56:45.958 --> 00:56:47.917
Hold her. hold her leg.
- Let go of me.

1182
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.458

- Zoe. Zoe I need you to
breathe for me. honey.

1185
00:56:54.417 --> 00:56:55.583
You gotta breathe for the baby.

1186

You've gotta breathe
for the baby. okay?

1187
00:56:58.542 --> 00:57:01.583
Push. push.
(Zoe groaning)

1188
00:57:01.708 --> 00:57:02.500
Zoe. I'm gonna
need you to focus.

1189
00:57:02.583 --> 00:57:03.667
I can see the head.

1190
00:57:03.792 --> 00:57:06.625
I just need one
more big push. okay?

1191
00:57:06.708 --> 00:57:08.833
One more. push on three. okay?

1192

This is it. one.

(Zoe whimpering)

1204
00:57:46.333 --> 00:57:48.542
You did it. Give me a blanket.

(machine beeping)

1206

- Hey. Penny. Penny.
(door knob clanking)

1210
00:58:08.458 --> 00:58:12.833

I made it. (laughing)

1215
00:58:22.958 --> 00:58:28.292
(laughing) Your sauna is
busted if you wanted to know.

1216
00:58:28.292 --> 00:58:29.750
Oh. God.

1217
00:58:29.833 --> 00:58:31.958

01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:23.500
- I. I can't.
- What do you mean you can't?

1245
01:00:23.583 --> 01:00:25.000
Walk two steps over
and let me out.

1246
01:00:25.125 --> 01:00:26.875
- How did you get
stuck in the sauna?

1247
01:00:26.958 --> 01:00:29.250
- [Adam] Penny brought
us here for spa day.

1248
01:00:29.375 --> 01:00:32.708
and I guess she accidentally
locked the sauna and the room.

1249
01:00:32.792 --> 01:00:34.250
and no one's come to let me out.

1250
01:00:36.375 --> 01:00:40.250
- Oh. it wasn't an accident.

1251
01:00:40.375 --> 01:00:41.792
- [Adam] What do you mean?

1252
01:00:41.875 --> 01:00:46.708
- [Kennedy] I just woke up on
the floor locked in this room.

1253
01:00:47.375 --> 01:00:49.542
- What? How?

1254
01:00:49.625 --> 01:00:51.042
- I don't know. I don't know.

1255
01:00:51.125 --> 01:00:55.667
The. the last thing I remember
was. is. is the sheriff.

1256
01:00:55.750 --> 01:00:57.167
The sheriff kidnapped me.

1257
01:00:57.208 --> 01:00:58.500
- Look here. girl.

1258
01:00:58.583 --> 01:01:01.708
You sound (laughs)
insane right now.

1259
01:01:01.792 --> 01:01:03.625
- He must have
drugged my coffee.

1260
01:01:04.917 --> 01:01:07.000
- Wait.

1261
01:01:07.042 --> 01:01:08.708
You trying to tell me they
tried to cook me in here?

1262
01:01:08.792 --> 01:01:10.500
- Well. do you blame them?

1263
01:01:10.583 --> 01:01:13.542
- Do you really have to be a
bitch in a moment of crisis?

1264
01:01:13.542 --> 01:01:15.417
- You know I hate that word.

1265
01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:16.750
- Focus. please.

1266
01:01:16.833 --> 01:01:18.875
We need to figure this out.

1267
01:01:18.958 --> 01:01:20.500
- Okay. you're right.

1268
01:01:20.583 --> 01:01:21.708
You're right.

1269
01:01:21.792 --> 01:01:23.000
We need to find Zoe.

1270
01:01:23.042 --> 01:01:25.333
- [Adam] They took
her to get a facial.

1271
01:01:25.417 --> 01:01:26.500
(door clattering)

1272
01:01:26.583 --> 01:01:28.250
- What?

1273
01:01:28.375 --> 01:01:29.292
She's alone with them?

1274
01:01:31.833 --> 01:01:33.625
Oh. my God.
- Why are they doing this?

1275
01:01:33.708 --> 01:01:34.958
I mean. what is all this about?

1276
01:01:35.042 --> 01:01:36.708
- I don't know. I don't know.

1277
01:01:36.792 --> 01:01:38.792
None of this is adding up.

1278
01:01:42.083 --> 01:01:42.792
Wait. wait.

1279
01:01:45.583 --> 01:01:48.333
Right before this. I.
I. I was just taken

1280
01:01:48.417 --> 01:01:52.167
off a huge account at
work by my own company.

1281
01:01:52.292 --> 01:01:53.583
- Really?

1282
01:01:53.583 --> 01:01:55.375
Even now you're
talking about work?

1283
01:01:55.375 --> 01:01:57.083
You know this is why Zoe
called me up here. right.

1284
01:01:57.167 --> 01:01:58.833
because you wouldn't
give her the time of day?

1285
01:01:58.958 --> 01:02:01.583
- I'm just saying
it's weird. Adam.

1286
01:02:01.708 --> 01:02:05.333
- Whatever it is. it is
not important right now.

1287
01:02:05.333 --> 01:02:06.500
- I was just trying.

1288
01:02:06.583 --> 01:02:09.667
I was just trying. but I
messed. I messed it all up.

1289
01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:13.375
Ugh. I messed it up.

1290
01:02:13.458 --> 01:02:15.375
- [Adam] Hey. it's
gonna be okay.

1291
01:02:15.542 --> 01:02:18.083
We're gonna find Zoe. and
we're gonna get out of here.

1292
01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:20.208
- [Kennedy] How?

1293
01:02:21.875 --> 01:02:24.708
- There's gotta be
a way outta here.

1294
01:02:24.792 --> 01:02:26.375
Hey. do you have an
air vent in your room?

1295
01:02:27.542 --> 01:02:28.417
- [Kennedy] Yes.

1296
01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:29.417
- [Adam] Okay. great.

1297
01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:30.625
I have one. too.

1298
01:02:30.625 --> 01:02:32.583
Maybe this leads to the way out.

1299
01:02:32.667 --> 01:02:34.583
- [Kennedy] Can you reach it?

1300
01:02:34.667 --> 01:02:37.792
- Yeah. if I get on
top of the sauna.

1301
01:02:37.875 --> 01:02:40.167
- [Kennedy] How are
you gonna do that?

1302
01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:42.708
- Girl. I've been on
enough rock climbing dates

1303
01:02:42.792 --> 01:02:45.333
to confidently say
that I got this.

1304
01:02:45.417 --> 01:02:47.250
(Adam laughing)

1305
01:02:47.333 --> 01:02:49.625
(suspenseful music)

1306
01:02:49.708 --> 01:02:52.375
(Adam grunting)

1307
01:02:56.708 --> 01:02:58.875
All right. I'm almost there.

1308
01:03:05.250 --> 01:03:10.000
(knees thudding)
(suspenseful music continues)

1309
01:03:26.083 --> 01:03:28.250
I don't know where am I going.

1310
01:03:28.333 --> 01:03:30.333
What am I doing?

1311
01:03:30.375 --> 01:03:31.417
Okay. breathe.

1312
01:03:33.583 --> 01:03:37.250
(suspenseful music continues)

1313
01:03:40.542 --> 01:03:41.833
(metal clanging)

1314
01:03:41.875 --> 01:03:44.167
(Adam screaming)
(bodies thudding)

1315
01:03:44.208 --> 01:03:46.833
(hand thudding)

1316
01:03:47.708 --> 01:03:50.833
(keys jangling)

1317
01:03:50.917 --> 01:03:53.125
(footsteps plodding)

1318
01:03:53.208 --> 01:03:55.792
(keys jangling)

1319
01:04:04.375 --> 01:04:06.417
(door clattering)

1320
01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:08.917
- Okay. let's go get somebody.

1321
01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:17.167
(Zoe whimpering)

1322
01:04:21.708 --> 01:04:24.000
(Velcro rasping)

1323
01:04:24.042 --> 01:04:28.958
(Zoe groaning)
(suspenseful music continues)

1324
01:04:35.958 --> 01:04:38.750
(door clattering)

1325
01:04:38.833 --> 01:04:39.833
(hand thudding)

1326
01:04:39.917 --> 01:04:41.250
- Please. help.

1327
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:48.500
Help. please. somebody.
(hand thudding)

1328
01:05:03.375 --> 01:05:04.208
- Zoe?

1329
01:05:05.625 --> 01:05:06.375
Zoe?

1330
01:05:10.875 --> 01:05:14.083
(congregation humming)

1331
01:05:14.958 --> 01:05:17.542
(door squeaking)

1332
01:05:20.208 --> 01:05:25.125
(congregation humming)
(suspenseful music continues)

1333
01:05:35.042 --> 01:05:36.417
What is he doing?

1334
01:05:38.708 --> 01:05:39.667
- Who's that?

1335
01:05:41.875 --> 01:05:43.042
- It can't be.

1336
01:05:45.375 --> 01:05:46.833
(floor squeaking)

1337
01:05:46.875 --> 01:05:49.958
What if Zoe's. what
if she's not okay?

1338
01:05:51.833 --> 01:05:53.625
- Welcome to the family.

1339
01:06:00.375 --> 01:06:01.667
(baby cooing)

1340
01:06:01.667 --> 01:06:03.458
- Welcome to the family.

1341
01:06:09.333 --> 01:06:13.583
- Our leader is here to help
us complete the ceremony.

1342
01:06:15.875 --> 01:06:19.542
(suspenseful music continues)

1343
01:06:24.417 --> 01:06:25.667
- Robert?

1344
01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:27.583
- Who's that?

1345
01:06:27.667 --> 01:06:28.708
- He's my boss.

1346
01:06:33.542 --> 01:06:36.000
- We welcome this new
member of our family

1347
01:06:36.083 --> 01:06:39.208
as a gift from the universe.

1348
01:06:39.292 --> 01:06:42.917
This baby being brought
to us healthy is proof

1349
01:06:43.042 --> 01:06:46.500
that our way of life
is the ultimate way

1350
01:06:46.583 --> 01:06:48.083
to spend our earthly days.

1351
01:06:51.875 --> 01:06:56.333
- We raise our
children as a group.

1352
01:06:56.375 --> 01:07:00.167
We give without taking. and
we reject the modern world

1353
01:07:00.208 --> 01:07:05.125
because we know we were
chosen for something more.

1354
01:07:07.042 --> 01:07:08.875
Go on. brother.

1355
01:07:08.958 --> 01:07:10.417
- Brother?

1356
01:07:10.542 --> 01:07:11.542
They're related?

1357
01:07:11.625 --> 01:07:15.167
- We must remember how
and why we were chosen.

1358
01:07:15.208 --> 01:07:18.500
This town was a
beacon of industry

1359
01:07:18.583 --> 01:07:21.833
until the mines bled
lead into our water.

1360
01:07:21.917 --> 01:07:25.542
the universe made us unable
to birth our own children

1361
01:07:25.625 --> 01:07:28.167
so that we would go
out and save children

1362
01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:32.333
from the horrible ways of
life outside of our town.

1363
01:07:32.417 --> 01:07:37.625
What seemed like a curse
was actually a blessing.

1364
01:07:37.708 --> 01:07:42.125
And we have saved dozens
of children over the years.

1365
01:07:42.208 --> 01:07:43.167
just like this one.

1366
01:07:46.833 --> 01:07:48.375
- Another salvaged soul.

1367
01:07:54.250 --> 01:07:56.833
- But recent times
have not been easy.

1368
01:07:56.917 --> 01:07:58.333
Our numbers are dwindling.

1369
01:07:58.417 --> 01:08:01.167
- It's been harder
than ever to procreate.

1370
01:08:01.292 --> 01:08:04.292
- There is much work to be done
if we are going to survive.

1371
01:08:05.333 --> 01:08:09.125
(suspenseful music continues)

1372
01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.167
- I'm going in there.

1373
01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:19.417
- No. no. no. no.
no. no. no. no.

1374
01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:20.833
Does now look like a good time?

1375
01:08:20.917 --> 01:08:25.417
- That is our baby. not his.

1376
01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:26.833
It's not his.

1377
01:08:26.958 --> 01:08:29.000
- We. we'll. we'll
get her. okay?

1378
01:08:29.083 --> 01:08:29.875
We're outnumbered right now.

1379
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.417
We have to find Zoe.

1380
01:08:33.375 --> 01:08:34.125
- Okay.

1381
01:08:35.583 --> 01:08:36.333
- Hey.

1382
01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:39.208
- Okay.

1383
01:08:44.208 --> 01:08:46.458
Okay. okay. let's.
let's get out of here

1384
01:08:46.542 --> 01:08:48.083
while they're still distracted.

1385
01:08:50.833 --> 01:08:53.500
(door squeaking)

1386
01:08:56.125 --> 01:09:01.083
(door clattering)
(suspenseful music continues)

1387
01:09:07.042 --> 01:09:07.750
- Oh. Zoe.

1388
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.042
- Oh. my God. oh. my God.

1389
01:09:11.125 --> 01:09:13.625
(door clattering)

1390
01:09:13.708 --> 01:09:15.167
- I'm so sorry.

1391
01:09:15.208 --> 01:09:16.833
I'm so sorry.

1392
01:09:16.958 --> 01:09:19.042
I'm so sorry that I left you.

1393
01:09:19.125 --> 01:09:20.125
I'm sorry.

1394
01:09:20.208 --> 01:09:21.417
- It's okay. It's okay.

1395
01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:23.000
- Are you okay?
- You're here now.

1396
01:09:23.083 --> 01:09:23.917
They took her.

1397
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.167
They took our baby.

1398
01:09:25.292 --> 01:09:27.750
- I know. I know.
- Yeah. we know.

1399
01:09:27.833 --> 01:09:28.750
- Where is she?

1400
01:09:28.875 --> 01:09:29.875
Do you know where she is?

1401
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.167
- We saw her.

1402
01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:32.833
She was at some sort of
ceremony type of thing.

1403
01:09:32.958 --> 01:09:34.250
- Take me to her.

1404
01:09:34.333 --> 01:09:36.000
- You just gave birth.

1405
01:09:36.083 --> 01:09:37.708
You can't.
- I don't care.

1406
01:09:37.792 --> 01:09:39.542
Take me to her. please.

1407
01:09:42.542 --> 01:09:43.375
- Okay.

1408
01:09:43.458 --> 01:09:44.333
- [Adam] All right. well. uh-

1409
01:09:44.417 --> 01:09:45.500
- Okay.

1410
01:09:45.583 --> 01:09:46.417
- [Adam] We gotta
stick together.

1411
01:09:47.333 --> 01:09:49.208
- Let's go get our baby.

1412
01:09:49.333 --> 01:09:50.667
- [Adam] All right.

1413
01:09:50.708 --> 01:09:51.667
- [Zoe] Okay.

1414
01:09:54.333 --> 01:09:56.000
(Zoe groaning)

1415
01:09:56.042 --> 01:09:57.500
- Okay. I got you.

1416
01:09:58.792 --> 01:10:00.792
You're gonna be okay.

1417
01:10:00.875 --> 01:10:04.542
(suspenseful music continues)

1418
01:10:07.625 --> 01:10:08.208
(door clattering)

1419
01:10:08.292 --> 01:10:11.500
(congregation humming)

1420
01:10:15.542 --> 01:10:16.333
(baby crying)

1421
01:10:16.417 --> 01:10:18.708
- Don't cry. don't cry. don't.

1422
01:10:26.708 --> 01:10:27.667
Yes. sweetie.

1423
01:10:29.792 --> 01:10:35.375
(footsteps plodding)
(suspenseful music continues)

1424
01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:36.833
Sh. sh. there. there.

1425
01:10:38.708 --> 01:10:39.958
- They escaped.

1426
01:10:40.042 --> 01:10:41.417
- Who?
- Kennedy and Adam.

1427
01:10:44.625 --> 01:10:46.417
(gun clanking)

1428
01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:49.458
(footsteps plodding)

1429
01:10:54.708 --> 01:10:55.750
- All right. um.

1430
01:10:58.833 --> 01:11:01.417
Kennedy. you can crowbar?

1431
01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:02.500
- Sure. this'll do.

1432
01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:05.000
Okay.

1433
01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.625
(suspenseful music continues)

1434
01:11:14.375 --> 01:11:15.333
(shovel thudding)

1435
01:11:15.375 --> 01:11:16.833
(body thudding)

1436
01:11:21.333 --> 01:11:23.792
(Zoe gasping)

1437
01:11:29.167 --> 01:11:30.792
(keys jangling)

1438
01:11:30.792 --> 01:11:31.833
What are you doing?

1439
01:11:31.917 --> 01:11:34.000
- We're going to need
the getaway car keys.

1440
01:11:34.083 --> 01:11:35.333
- You're okay.

1441
01:11:35.417 --> 01:11:38.000
Okay. she's okay. (laughs)

1442
01:11:38.167 --> 01:11:40.083
- Let's go.
- She's okay.

1443
01:11:40.167 --> 01:11:41.167
Let's go.
- Go.

1444
01:11:41.250 --> 01:11:45.250
(door clattering and squeaking)

1445
01:11:46.333 --> 01:11:49.000
(suspenseful music continues)

1446
01:11:49.083 --> 01:11:50.083
- Oh. my God.

1447
01:11:50.167 --> 01:11:51.292
- How could you let this happen?

1448
01:11:51.375 --> 01:11:52.500
- I have been the
one making sure

1449
01:11:52.583 --> 01:11:54.250
that everything is
taken care of by myself.

1450
01:11:54.333 --> 01:11:55.208
- Don't try to deflect.

1451
01:11:55.292 --> 01:11:56.458
This was your responsibility.

1452
01:11:56.542 --> 01:11:57.333
- Well. I could
have used some help.

1453
01:11:57.417 --> 01:11:58.875
You are never here.

1454
01:11:58.958 --> 01:12:00.542
- I have been making sure
that we have the funds

1455
01:12:00.625 --> 01:12:01.833
to keep this place prospering.

1456
01:12:01.875 --> 01:12:04.667
- Or do you just like
to be in the city?

1457
01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:06.958
- Enough. we're wasting time.

1458
01:12:06.958 --> 01:12:10.500
(suspenseful music continues)

1459
01:12:12.833 --> 01:12:13.667
- No.

1460
01:12:16.333 --> 01:12:17.542
(footsteps plodding)

1461
01:12:17.625 --> 01:12:19.083
- [Captive] Please
let me out of here.

1462
01:12:19.167 --> 01:12:20.167
(hand thudding)

1463
01:12:20.208 --> 01:12:23.542
Please help me.
- Oh. my God.

1464
01:12:23.625 --> 01:12:25.458
- [Captive] Please
let me outta here.

1465
01:12:25.542 --> 01:12:27.292
- I don't know.
- Should we?

1466
01:12:27.375 --> 01:12:29.917
- We don't have time. Zoe.

1467
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.292
- [Captive] Please let me out.
(hand thudding)

1468
01:12:31.375 --> 01:12:32.917
- Guys. we gotta help her.

1469
01:12:33.042 --> 01:12:38.708
(hand thudding)
(keys jangling)

1470
01:12:38.792 --> 01:12:39.333
- [Adam] Back up.

1471
01:12:41.542 --> 01:12:43.292
- Oh. my God. don't
come any closer.

1472
01:12:43.375 --> 01:12:44.583
- Please. don't be afraid.

1473
01:12:44.667 --> 01:12:45.708
I know what they
must have told you.

1474
01:12:45.792 --> 01:12:47.208
but I was trying to warn
you about this town.

1475
01:12:47.292 --> 01:12:48.625
- How do we know
you're not one of them?

1476
01:12:48.708 --> 01:12:49.458
- I was.

1477
01:12:51.250 --> 01:12:52.917
I was stolen from my
mother and raised here.

1478
01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.875
But I don't believe
in anything they do.

1479
01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:56.833
I do know a way out.

1480
01:12:56.875 --> 01:12:57.583
Let me help you.

1481
01:12:59.833 --> 01:13:01.333
- Wait. wait.

1482
01:13:01.417 --> 01:13:02.833
How do you know
you can trust her?

1483
01:13:02.917 --> 01:13:05.750
- Baby. I don't think
we have a choice.

1484
01:13:05.833 --> 01:13:06.458
Let's go.

1485
01:13:07.375 --> 01:13:10.042
(keys jangling)

1486
01:13:10.125 --> 01:13:13.833
(suspenseful music continues)

1487
01:13:22.542 --> 01:13:23.667
- Did you do this?

1488
01:13:23.792 --> 01:13:25.625
Did you lead us to
them on purpose?

1489
01:13:25.708 --> 01:13:27.833
- I didn't know.
I just wanna help.

1490
01:13:27.917 --> 01:13:29.792
- What do we do?

1491
01:13:29.875 --> 01:13:31.167
- The only place
to go is the mine.

1492
01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:32.292
They won't go in there.
(baby crying)

1493
01:13:32.375 --> 01:13:33.542
- Well. why not?

1494
01:13:33.625 --> 01:13:34.667
- They believe it's
sacred or cursed.

1495
01:13:34.750 --> 01:13:36.375
depending on how you look at it.

1496
01:13:36.458 --> 01:13:38.375
But go. there's a
door on the side.

1497
01:13:38.458 --> 01:13:39.667
Find it.

1498
01:13:39.708 --> 01:13:40.458
- Well. aren't you
coming with us?

1499
01:13:40.542 --> 01:13:41.667
- I'll get us help.

1500
01:13:41.708 --> 01:13:43.208
I'm not the only
person in this town

1501
01:13:43.292 --> 01:13:45.083
who disagrees with them.

1502
01:13:45.167 --> 01:13:46.500
It's time the rest spoke up.

1503
01:13:49.208 --> 01:13:50.417
Now. go.

1504
01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:51.625
- Go. go. go.

1505
01:13:53.708 --> 01:13:59.500
(footsteps plodding)
(suspenseful music continues)

1506
01:13:59.542 --> 01:14:01.250
- Should we go after her?

1507
01:14:01.333 --> 01:14:03.000
- We've got bigger
things to worry about.

1508
01:14:04.583 --> 01:14:08.125
(suspenseful music continues)

1509
01:14:17.542 --> 01:14:19.500
- They're going inside.

1510
01:14:21.792 --> 01:14:23.625
- They'll have to come
out sooner than later.

1511
01:14:24.542 --> 01:14:27.750
(footsteps plodding)

1512
01:14:27.875 --> 01:14:29.833
- [Zoe] Oh. it's so dark.

1513
01:14:32.292 --> 01:14:34.167
(box rasping)

1514
01:14:34.292 --> 01:14:36.958
- Hey. guys. it's tools.

1515
01:14:37.042 --> 01:14:38.583
(box clanging)

1516
01:14:38.667 --> 01:14:40.125
- Flashlight.
- Yes.

1517
01:14:40.208 --> 01:14:40.917
- Here.
- Okay.

1518
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:41.792
- Take one.

1519
01:14:41.875 --> 01:14:44.125
(baby crying)

1520
01:14:54.083 --> 01:14:54.833
Be careful.

1521
01:15:00.583 --> 01:15:02.958
Guys. I don't know about this.

1522
01:15:04.458 --> 01:15:05.958
- [Zoe] It's okay.

1523
01:15:06.042 --> 01:15:07.292
We'll find a way out.

1524
01:15:07.375 --> 01:15:09.417
- [Kennedy] What
if there isn't one?

1525
01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:10.750
- [Zoe] Then we'll make one.

1526
01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.958
(birds squawking)
(suspenseful music continues)

1527
01:15:19.833 --> 01:15:22.167
- Ugh. something
smells horrible.

1528
01:15:22.208 --> 01:15:23.000
- [Zoe] Mm.

1529
01:15:24.167 --> 01:15:25.125
(Zoe gasps)

1530
01:15:25.208 --> 01:15:26.167
- Guys.

1531
01:15:26.250 --> 01:15:27.125
(dramatic music)

1532
01:15:27.208 --> 01:15:27.875
- Oh.
- Oh. my God.

1533
01:15:32.417 --> 01:15:33.125
- Miners?

1534
01:15:35.833 --> 01:15:36.500
- Parents.

1535
01:15:40.667 --> 01:15:42.208
- I'm going in.
- What?

1536
01:15:42.333 --> 01:15:43.500
- As the leader
of this community.

1537
01:15:43.625 --> 01:15:45.542
I am permitted to enter
the mine in emergencies.

1538
01:15:45.625 --> 01:15:46.708
- You just made that up.

1539
01:15:46.792 --> 01:15:48.542
- [Kennedy] What is this?

1540
01:15:48.625 --> 01:15:50.625
- Oh. my God.
- It's like witchcraft.

1541
01:15:50.708 --> 01:15:52.375
(paper rustling)

1542
01:15:52.375 --> 01:15:56.333
- It's some sort of ceremonious
ritual or something.

1543
01:15:56.417 --> 01:15:59.375
Wait.
(paper rustling)

1544
01:15:59.458 --> 01:16:02.042
You guys. these are
the names of the people

1545
01:16:02.125 --> 01:16:02.708
that they killed.

1546
01:16:02.792 --> 01:16:03.833
- Are you questioning me?

1547
01:16:03.875 --> 01:16:06.750
- You can't just
break the rules.

1548
01:16:06.833 --> 01:16:07.875
I mean. these are the rules

1549
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.792
that we live by.
- I'm going in.

1550
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.500
- Wait. that's Megan.
(paper rustling)

1551
01:16:13.542 --> 01:16:15.167
She worked at the firm.

1552
01:16:15.208 --> 01:16:15.917
- Guys.

1553
01:16:17.708 --> 01:16:19.792
(necklace jingling)

1554
01:16:19.792 --> 01:16:22.542
Look.
- Oh. that must be hers.

1555
01:16:22.625 --> 01:16:24.792
- I'll be right
back with that baby.

1556
01:16:24.875 --> 01:16:29.792
(footsteps plodding)
(suspenseful music continues)

1557
01:16:43.167 --> 01:16:44.292
- This is a lot of names.

1558
01:16:44.375 --> 01:16:46.458
- This goes back
at least 50 years.

1559
01:16:46.542 --> 01:16:48.417
- Oh. God.
- We need to find a way out.

1560
01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:51.333
- Okay. okay. go.
go. go. oh. my God.

1561
01:16:53.708 --> 01:16:58.583
(footsteps plodding)
(suspenseful music continues)

1562
01:17:02.125 --> 01:17:04.708
(baby crying)

1563
01:17:06.750 --> 01:17:08.500
- [Robert] Where are you headed?

1564
01:17:08.542 --> 01:17:09.750
(shovel thudding)
(Carla grunting)

1565
01:17:09.875 --> 01:17:11.958
- Let's get outta here.
- Oh. my God.

1566
01:17:12.042 --> 01:17:15.375
(suspenseful music continues)

1567
01:17:15.375 --> 01:17:17.917
(Zoe gasping)

1568
01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:23.125
Okay.

1569
01:17:23.208 --> 01:17:23.917
- Sh.

1570
01:17:27.542 --> 01:17:28.500
- How are we gonna
get past them?

1571
01:17:28.542 --> 01:17:29.875
- Don't worry.

1572
01:17:29.958 --> 01:17:30.833
Help will be here
in a few minutes.

1573
01:17:36.458 --> 01:17:37.333
(dramatic music)
(gun clanking)

1574
01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:38.333
- Give me the baby.

1575
01:17:38.375 --> 01:17:40.833
(Zoe gasping)

1576
01:17:43.417 --> 01:17:44.333
- Oh.
- Okay.

1577
01:17:44.375 --> 01:17:45.625
- Okay. come on.
- Yeah.

1578
01:17:45.708 --> 01:17:47.083
- [Kennedy] Okay.

1579
01:17:48.125 --> 01:17:50.750
(Zoe whimpering)

1580
01:17:55.958 --> 01:17:59.000
- Give me the baby.
(baby crying)

1581
01:17:59.083 --> 01:17:59.750
Back up.

1582
01:18:01.333 --> 01:18:02.083
- No.

1583
01:18:03.958 --> 01:18:05.042
- I'll shoot her then.

1584
01:18:07.125 --> 01:18:09.750
(Robert gasping)

1585
01:18:10.667 --> 01:18:11.750
- How could you lose them?

1586
01:18:11.833 --> 01:18:14.042
- I had them.

1587
01:18:14.167 --> 01:18:15.833
- You know. this is your
fault because you're the one

1588
01:18:15.917 --> 01:18:16.958
who brought these
difficult ones here.

1589
01:18:17.042 --> 01:18:18.375
and then you wanted
to be the hero.

1590
01:18:18.458 --> 01:18:19.625
so you went in and
broke the rules.

1591
01:18:19.708 --> 01:18:21.292
- I make the rules.

1592
01:18:21.375 --> 01:18:22.500
- Why is that?

1593
01:18:22.542 --> 01:18:23.875
I do all the work.

1594
01:18:23.958 --> 01:18:25.250
All you do is stand
up there and talk.

1595
01:18:25.333 --> 01:18:27.542
- I don't need to prove
my dedication to you.

1596
01:18:27.625 --> 01:18:29.333
I'm going after them.

1597
01:18:29.417 --> 01:18:33.167
(footsteps plodding)

1598
01:18:33.208 --> 01:18:34.792
- Okay. okay. listen.

1599
01:18:34.875 --> 01:18:35.583
I will give you the baby.

1600
01:18:35.667 --> 01:18:37.500
Just put the gun down.

1601
01:18:37.583 --> 01:18:38.750
- Zoe. no.

1602
01:18:42.833 --> 01:18:44.000
(baby crying)

1603
01:18:44.083 --> 01:18:44.833
(Zoe groaning)

1604
01:18:44.917 --> 01:18:45.958
- No. no.
- Zoe. Zoe.

1605
01:18:47.542 --> 01:18:48.667
(fist thudding)
(Zoe grunting)

1606
01:18:48.750 --> 01:18:49.542
(body thudding)
Let's go. let's go.

1607
01:18:49.667 --> 01:18:50.542
Give her to me.

1608
01:18:50.625 --> 01:18:52.333
Let's go. let's go. let's go.

1609
01:18:52.375 --> 01:18:53.542
(body thudding)

1610
01:18:53.708 --> 01:18:55.083
Get to the car.
- Come on. let's go.

1611
01:18:58.875 --> 01:18:59.875
- Get in.
(baby crying)

1612
01:18:59.875 --> 01:19:00.833
- Zoe. take the baby.

1613
01:19:00.833 --> 01:19:02.167
Good?
- Yeah.

1614
01:19:02.250 --> 01:19:03.708
- Now. listen.

1615
01:19:03.792 --> 01:19:04.833
We are not gonna be a part
(Penny screaming)

1616
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.083
of the murderous cult anymore.
(rake thudding)

1617
01:19:07.167 --> 01:19:08.000
(Adam groaning)

1618
01:19:08.125 --> 01:19:09.583
You've been brainwashed
into thinking

1619
01:19:09.667 --> 01:19:11.083
it's for some higher good.
(Penny grunting)

1620
01:19:11.208 --> 01:19:12.125
(foot thudding)
(Penny screaming)

1621
01:19:12.208 --> 01:19:12.833
But it's not.
(body thudding)

1622
01:19:12.958 --> 01:19:15.292
It's just selfishness.

1623
01:19:15.375 --> 01:19:16.125
(door slamming)

1624
01:19:16.208 --> 01:19:17.333
- Drive. Zo.

1625
01:19:17.417 --> 01:19:21.417
- Hey. you're not going
anywhere with that baby.

1626
01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:24.167
(engine revving)

1627
01:19:24.208 --> 01:19:26.792
(body thudding)

1628
01:19:26.875 --> 01:19:30.833
- Robert. (gasping)

1629
01:19:30.875 --> 01:19:32.833
Robert. please help me.

1630
01:19:35.875 --> 01:19:39.125
(door clattering)

1631
01:19:39.208 --> 01:19:39.917
Please.

1632
01:19:40.833 --> 01:19:43.458
(engine revving)

1633
01:19:51.208 --> 01:19:54.000
(tires screeching)

1634
01:19:57.417 --> 01:19:58.667
- Adam. are you okay?

1635
01:19:58.750 --> 01:20:01.208
- (grunts) I don't know.
Zoe. this shit hurts.

1636
01:20:01.333 --> 01:20:02.042
- It's okay. It's okay.

1637
01:20:03.792 --> 01:20:09.417
(engines humming)
(suspenseful music continues)

1638
01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:10.917
Oh. Zoe. hurry up.

1639
01:20:18.708 --> 01:20:19.500
(hand thudding)

1640
01:20:19.625 --> 01:20:20.375
- Come on.

1641
01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:21.792
Don't die on me today.

1642
01:20:24.792 --> 01:20:26.833
(horn honking)

1643
01:20:26.917 --> 01:20:29.833
(engine humming)

1644
01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:35.000
- [Kennedy] Come on. Zoe.

1645
01:20:35.042 --> 01:20:35.917
- [Zoe] I don't. it's
not going any faster.

1646
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.833
Something's wrong with the car.

1647
01:20:37.875 --> 01:20:40.917
(engine revving)

1648
01:20:41.042 --> 01:20:43.542
(tires screeching)

1649
01:20:43.667 --> 01:20:45.208
- He's getting closer.

1650
01:20:45.292 --> 01:20:46.917
- [Adam] It should be fine. Zo.

1651
01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:47.833
(keys jangling)
(Adam mumbling)

1652
01:20:47.917 --> 01:20:48.833
- [Zoe] It's dead.

1653
01:20:48.917 --> 01:20:51.458
(tires screeching)

1654
01:20:51.542 --> 01:20:52.333
(baby crying)

1655
01:20:52.417 --> 01:20:54.542
(door clattering)

1656
01:20:54.667 --> 01:20:55.292
- Can we talk?

1657
01:20:57.208 --> 01:21:00.917
- Okay. take this
to protect her.

1658
01:21:02.458 --> 01:21:04.750
Here. keep holding pressure.

1659
01:21:04.833 --> 01:21:07.500
(door clattering)

1660
01:21:11.708 --> 01:21:13.167
- [Robert] Kennedy.

1661
01:21:13.208 --> 01:21:16.375
- So all of that at the
firm. that was all BS. right?

1662
01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:20.708
That was all just
to lead us here?

1663
01:21:20.833 --> 01:21:22.333
- You were a good employee.

1664
01:21:22.417 --> 01:21:24.375
but I had another
job to do as well.

1665
01:21:24.458 --> 01:21:26.542
- This is insane.

1666
01:21:26.667 --> 01:21:29.250
How many kids have you taken?

1667
01:21:29.333 --> 01:21:31.333
How many lives have you ruined?

1668
01:21:31.458 --> 01:21:34.167
- We give them the best
family they could ever have.

1669
01:21:34.208 --> 01:21:37.958
- Oh. fine. just not
with their real parents.

1670
01:21:38.042 --> 01:21:39.667
- You know what. Kennedy?

1671
01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:41.917
You worked for me.

1672
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:45.000
You spent every waking
moment at the office.

1673
01:21:48.750 --> 01:21:51.458
You would not have
been a good mom.

1674
01:21:51.542 --> 01:21:55.208
- Do not move any closer.
(dramatic music)

1675
01:21:55.333 --> 01:21:57.042
(door slamming)

1676
01:21:57.125 --> 01:22:00.167
- Okay. let's not overreact now.

1677
01:22:00.250 --> 01:22:01.417
- Everyone has been telling me

1678
01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:03.917
I've been overreacting
this whole time.

1679
01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.292
I'm done not trusting my gut.

1680
01:22:08.458 --> 01:22:10.542
(gunshot blasting)

1681
01:22:10.625 --> 01:22:13.125
- Okay. all right.

1682
01:22:13.208 --> 01:22:14.250
You see now. Kennedy?

1683
01:22:14.250 --> 01:22:15.542
You said it yourself.
- No.

1684
01:22:16.667 --> 01:22:20.042
- You are too emotional.

1685
01:22:20.958 --> 01:22:22.000
- No. I'm not.

1686
01:22:22.042 --> 01:22:23.458
(gunshot blasting)

1687
01:22:23.542 --> 01:22:25.625
(body thudding)

1688
01:22:25.708 --> 01:22:27.417
- Okay. okay.

1689
01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:28.958
(door clattering)

1690
01:22:29.042 --> 01:22:31.500
(engine humming)

1691
01:22:31.625 --> 01:22:33.292
- Don't just stand there.

1692
01:22:33.375 --> 01:22:34.125
Get in.

1693
01:22:39.917 --> 01:22:42.750
(door clattering)

1694
01:22:42.833 --> 01:22:44.750
(baby crying)

1695
01:22:44.875 --> 01:22:47.667
God. I knew that town was weird.

1696
01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:48.917
(baby crying)

1697
01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.542
Oh. God. they got you
good. didn't they?

1698
01:22:50.542 --> 01:22:51.667
How you holding up?

1699
01:22:51.792 --> 01:22:53.667
- Wouldn't say I'm
thriving. (laughs)

1700
01:22:53.792 --> 01:22:55.000
- Yeah. you know.
come to think of it.

1701
01:22:55.125 --> 01:22:57.250
I saw a lot of pregnant
ladies go to that town.

1702
01:22:57.250 --> 01:22:59.167
but I never saw any
of 'em come out.

1703
01:23:00.375 --> 01:23:01.583
- Girl. why didn't
you tell me that

1704
01:23:01.708 --> 01:23:03.167
when you saw us going in?

1705
01:23:03.167 --> 01:23:05.083
- It didn't jump out
at me at the time.

1706
01:23:06.208 --> 01:23:08.333
- Well. thank you
for everything.

1707
01:23:08.375 --> 01:23:10.958
(gentle music)

1708
01:23:11.042 --> 01:23:12.500
You're safe.

1709
01:23:12.542 --> 01:23:14.500
You're safe.

1710
01:23:14.583 --> 01:23:16.792
They didn't get you.
and they are never going

1711
01:23:16.875 --> 01:23:18.333
to hurt anyone else ever again.

1712
01:23:20.875 --> 01:23:25.250
- Zoe. I am so sorry
that I ignored you

1713
01:23:25.333 --> 01:23:27.375
and your intuition
about this place.

1714
01:23:29.458 --> 01:23:30.292
I promise you.

1715
01:23:32.042 --> 01:23:35.208
From now on. I am only
focusing on us. okay?

1716
01:23:36.833 --> 01:23:37.958
I promise.

1717
01:23:38.042 --> 01:23:39.250
- I missed us.

1718
