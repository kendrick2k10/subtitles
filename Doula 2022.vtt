00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:09.069
Fuck.
Man. this is never gonna work.

4
00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:13.156
I don't see a baby.
I see. like. an orange-ish blob.

5
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.704
I mean... I don't know.
is it supposed to...?

6
00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:21.081
Penka?

7
00:01:29.715 --> 00:01:31.258
Silvio?

8
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.552
SILVIO: Oh. I forgot
your milk. Penka.

9
00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:36.013
Silvio! No. it's not...
Come here now.

10
00:01:36.054 --> 00:01:39.141
-What's up?
-Um...

11
00:01:39.183 --> 00:01:41.435
-What's up?
-I think she... Oh.

12
00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:45.564
What? Penka?

13
00:01:52.154 --> 00:01:53.155
Penka.

14
00:01:53.197 --> 00:01:54.531
-(WOMAN GASPS)
-Oh.

15
00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:06.043
(BACKGROUND CHATTER)

(BABY COOS)

18
00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:17.221
Sure. You have
multi-instrumentalist vibes.

19
00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:18.847
-That's why I ask.
-Oh. OK.

20
00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:26.605
My labor was
54 hours and 45 minutes.

21
00:02:26.647 --> 00:02:28.315
Think about
the symmetry of that.

22
00:02:28.357 --> 00:02:29.274
Yeah. Whew.

23
00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:33.070
I mean. after hour 12.
just gimme the epidural.

24
00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:36.490
I mean. it's just. like...
I just wanna be numb. you know?

25
00:02:36.532 --> 00:02:39.201
To be honest. I've been
chipping with the oxies already.

26
00:02:39.243 --> 00:02:41.495
It's my lower back.
It's been killing me.

27
00:02:41.537 --> 00:02:43.372
An oxy here and there's
not gonna hurt the baby.

28
00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:45.123
OK. she's... she's...

29
00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:46.959
-She's kidding.
-Oh. (LAUGHS)

30
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.127
-She's kidding.
-No. I'm not.

31
00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:50.754
(CHUCKLES)

32
00:02:50.796 --> 00:02:54.091
So have you found
a replacement?

33
00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:55.050
WOMAN: A replacement?

34
00:02:55.092 --> 00:02:57.553
-For poor sweet Penka.
-WOMAN: Oh.

35
00:02:57.594 --> 00:02:59.930
Um. well. we did
just kind of talk about

36
00:02:59.972 --> 00:03:01.306
doing a hospital birth.

37
00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:03.433
-Did we. though?
-What?

38
00:03:03.475 --> 00:03:05.519
First of all. slow your roll.

39
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:08.272
I mean. it's like.
we're pretty far along as it is.

40
00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:10.315
and Penka was kinda
the only person

41
00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:11.692
that I would want to do...

42
00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:13.944
Well. but Penka...
Penka was special.

43
00:03:13.986 --> 00:03:15.696
So special. So special.

44
00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:19.700
Right. but... It doesn't mean
there aren't more...

45
00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:22.452
-other special...
-I think that we're just...

46
00:03:22.494 --> 00:03:24.705
-We're still figuring it out.
-Yeah.

47
00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:28.333
Sounds like you two
are still figuring it out.

48
00:03:40.846 --> 00:03:43.056
-Hi.
-Hi.

49
00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:47.644
Do you know what that is?

50
00:03:49.188 --> 00:03:50.689
Cabbage.

51
00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:53.317
And this one?

52
00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:57.654
-Cabbage again.
-Right.

53
00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:00.949
-A lot of cabbage.
-Hm-hmm.

54
00:04:05.454 --> 00:04:07.497
Boys. can I have
your attention. please?

55
00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:11.585
MAN: Boys? Hi.

56
00:04:15.297 --> 00:04:18.007
Do you know why
everyone's here today?

57
00:04:19.343 --> 00:04:20.928
My mommy died.

58
00:04:22.513 --> 00:04:24.389
Do you remember Penka?

59
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:26.433
She was there
when you were born.

60
00:04:26.475 --> 00:04:29.478
Her hands were the first
human hands to ever touch you.

61
00:04:31.647 --> 00:04:35.651
Do you know where you were
before you came to this world?

62
00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:39.363
Do you know where you go
when you leave?

63
00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:45.202
You walk. just like Penka.
back over the Rainbow Bridge.

64
00:04:45.244 --> 00:04:49.164
But everyone you leave behind
will stay here

65
00:04:49.206 --> 00:04:51.166
and be very. very sad.

66
00:04:51.208 --> 00:04:54.086
Your mommy. your daddy.

67
00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:57.589
everyone you ever loved will be
very sad that you're gone.

68
00:04:57.631 --> 00:05:00.968
And you. Thor. and you. Erik.

69
00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.428
you won't be Thor
and you won't be Erik anymore.

70
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.099
-Who will we be?
-You'll be nothing.

71
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.892
Then your bodies
will burn into dust

72
00:05:08.934 --> 00:05:12.479
and... everything you thought
you were will be no more.

73
00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:17.776
MAN: Hmm.

74
00:05:21.613 --> 00:05:23.282
(MAN CHUCKLES)

75
00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:28.579
What did we call it
when we were kids

76
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.747
or what did they call it
in comic books?

77
00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:34.042
X-ray vision. right?

78
00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:39.590
You could see through people's
pants and shirts. right?

79
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.177
Superpower.

80
00:05:45.387 --> 00:05:47.723
It's what Penka had.

81
00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:50.893
Those of you who knew her
know what I'm talking about.

82
00:05:50.934 --> 00:05:53.187
Now. by saying that she
could see into this mystery.

83
00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:56.732
am I saying that
she had all the answers? No.

84
00:05:56.773 --> 00:06:00.944
Did she have the ability
to change the outcome? No.

85
00:06:00.986 --> 00:06:03.530
No. she didn't.

86
00:06:03.572 --> 00:06:05.574
Because in the end.

87
00:06:05.616 --> 00:06:08.911
we are all. and can only be.
servants to the will of God

88
00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:11.205
and not even Penka knew that.

89
00:06:12.873 --> 00:06:14.374
Isn't that...

90
00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:18.170
Isn't that beautiful?

91
00:06:18.212 --> 00:06:25.427
That fine line between...
and she. you know?

92
00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:31.767
We can use reason so much to get
to the bottom of things. right?

93
00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:33.602
We wanna be able
to figure it out.

94
00:06:33.644 --> 00:06:36.396
I wanna get to the bottom.
Where's it going? Oh.

95
00:06:38.023 --> 00:06:40.984
Where'd it go?

96
00:06:41.026 --> 00:06:44.571
It's a hundred miles back
that way. It's fucking gone.

97
00:06:44.613 --> 00:06:46.240
It's fucking gone.

98
00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:55.207
You cut down a tree
to see what's inside.

99
00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:56.834
What do you wind up with?

100
00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:01.421
A dead tree. right?

101
00:07:03.006 --> 00:07:05.968
So the tree is a tree.

102
00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:09.805
Penka is Penka.

103
00:07:09.847 --> 00:07:12.683
Let us rejoice in her now
in God's name.

104
00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:15.269
Amen.

105
00:07:21.316 --> 00:07:22.860
Sascha?

106
00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:53.724
(WHISPERS) Who's that?

107
00:07:55.559 --> 00:07:57.394
(WHISPERS) That's Penka's son.

108
00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:12.553
How's school?

109
00:09:12.594 --> 00:09:15.848
-BOY: G-O-O-D.
-Really?

110
00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:17.099
That's not what your mom said.

111
00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.935
Whatever she tells you. I did
not get sent home from school.

112
00:09:19.977 --> 00:09:22.729
Yes. you did!
You got sent home from school.

113
00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:25.190
-Hi. Silvio.
-Hi.

114
00:09:25.232 --> 00:09:26.859
WOMAN: Yes. he did
get sent home from school

115
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.819
for leaving the classroom
without permission.

116
00:09:28.861 --> 00:09:30.112
Hmm. Will?

117
00:09:30.153 --> 00:09:34.116
-Where are you going?
-I'm getting ice cream. Chill!

118
00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:37.911
Ice cream. really? I mean...

119
00:09:37.953 --> 00:09:40.998
-Whatever.
-How's it going over there?

120
00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:44.877
Will. can you go out back
for a second?

121
00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:47.921
-Why?
-I need to talk to Daddy alone.

122
00:09:47.963 --> 00:09:49.756
Yeah. It's just...
I'd be more comfortable

123
00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:51.216
if you didn't do that.

124
00:09:51.258 --> 00:09:52.301
WOMAN: Do what?

125
00:09:52.342 --> 00:09:54.344
Just the whole.
"I need to talk to Daddy."

126
00:09:54.386 --> 00:09:56.889
Just. "I need to speak
to your father."

127
00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.974
or. "I need to talk
to your dad."

128
00:09:59.016 --> 00:10:00.142
Just... it's better that way

129
00:10:00.184 --> 00:10:02.561
because otherwise. it seems
like we're still together.

130
00:10:02.603 --> 00:10:06.064
-OK.
-Well. don't be mad.

131
00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:08.275
No. it's fine.
We're definitely not together.

132
00:10:08.317 --> 00:10:10.110
So don't... you don't
have to do the thing...

133
00:10:10.152 --> 00:10:12.279
So. did you. um. get a chance

134
00:10:12.321 --> 00:10:15.032
to think
about what we talked about?

135
00:10:15.073 --> 00:10:17.534
-Yeah and. um...
-What did you decide?

136
00:10:17.576 --> 00:10:19.203
Because I've been thinking
about it

137
00:10:19.244 --> 00:10:21.538
and he really needs
his father right now.

138
00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.123
Totally. There's just
a lot of things

139
00:10:23.165 --> 00:10:24.208
on this side of it. Natasha.

140
00:10:24.249 --> 00:10:26.418
Like. we have to get
a bigger house

141
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.086
and the baby's coming soon.

142
00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:30.631
-I know. Exciting.
-Hm-hmm.

143
00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:33.342
The only thing...

144
00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:35.802
I have this yoga retreat
in Tulum

145
00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:38.847
coming up
right around winter break.

146
00:10:38.889 --> 00:10:41.183
OK. So. like. in three months.

147
00:10:41.225 --> 00:10:42.893
Well. right. but I need to book

148
00:10:42.935 --> 00:10:45.270
the plane ticket
and the hotel now.

149
00:10:45.312 --> 00:10:47.564
Oh. I see.

150
00:10:47.606 --> 00:10:50.234
So. can you take him?

151
00:10:52.486 --> 00:10:55.697
Yeah. I mean.
what I was gonna say

152
00:10:55.739 --> 00:10:58.617
was we talked about it and yes.

153
00:10:58.659 --> 00:11:00.369
we can take him.

154
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.330
-And be happy to.
-Really? That's great.

155
00:11:03.372 --> 00:11:06.208
-What are you doing?
-I mean. I think you're right.

156
00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.544
-He needs his dad.
-I'll start packing his stuff.

157
00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:12.381
-Bye. Will.
-Daddy says. "Bye. Will."

158
00:11:12.422 --> 00:11:13.674
Yeah. seriously. Goodbye.

159
00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:15.509
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

160
00:11:17.094 --> 00:11:18.387
Holy shit!

161
00:11:18.428 --> 00:11:20.305
-Hi.
-Oh. sorry.

162
00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:21.473
I'm Sascha.

163
00:11:21.515 --> 00:11:24.059
People don't usually
come that way.

164
00:11:24.101 --> 00:11:26.019
Just... around the front.

165
00:11:26.061 --> 00:11:28.188
OK. Lev. Bounce pass.
Here he goes.

166
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.315
-OK.
-Layup.

167
00:11:30.357 --> 00:11:32.609
He's coming in hot.
He's coming in hot.

168
00:11:32.651 --> 00:11:34.903
-Yeah!
-Yes!

169
00:11:34.945 --> 00:11:36.822
Yes. all right.
No. Lev. That's good.

170
00:11:36.864 --> 00:11:38.907
If you blow the layup.
don't grab the board.

171
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:40.784
You just circle back.
you try it again.

172
00:11:40.826 --> 00:11:42.536
-OK.
-You crush.

173
00:11:42.578 --> 00:11:45.205
Madonna. you ready? Bounce pass.

174
00:11:45.247 --> 00:11:47.583
Here she goes.
here she goes. here she goes.

175
00:11:47.624 --> 00:11:48.876
She's up.

176
00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:52.963
-(CHEERING)
-Sick!

177
00:11:53.005 --> 00:11:56.049
WOMAN: Guys. this is so sweet.

178
00:11:56.091 --> 00:11:59.428
But. I mean. I'm really
not gonna be gone for that long.

179
00:11:59.469 --> 00:12:01.346
Like. maybe six months tops.

180
00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:03.891
So I don't really see the reason
for all this cake and shit.

181
00:12:03.932 --> 00:12:06.560
Although.
I do really appreciate it.

182
00:12:06.602 --> 00:12:08.312
Um. I don't know.

183
00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:11.231
maybe some of you guys won't
be here by the time I get back.

184
00:12:11.273 --> 00:12:13.150
I mean. you guys
aren't looking too good.

185
00:12:14.318 --> 00:12:16.778
It's real. Let it sink in.

186
00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.239
And if that's the case. I do
wanna take this moment to say

187
00:12:19.281 --> 00:12:22.451
that you guys are the best damn
basketball team of octogenarians

188
00:12:22.492 --> 00:12:25.370
that I've ever had the pleasure
to coach.

189
00:12:25.412 --> 00:12:27.539
You guys. just please keep
running your drills and shit.

190
00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:30.626
You're getting good.
really good.

191
00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:33.170
and I'm super proud of you.

192
00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:39.426
God. that is sickly sweet. Lev.
stay away from this stuff. OK?

193
00:12:39.468 --> 00:12:41.345
It's gonna put you
in a diabetic coma. yeah?

194
00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:43.222
I can have a little.

195
00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:45.849
(TYPING)

196
00:12:52.189 --> 00:12:53.690
(SIGHS)

197
00:12:55.234 --> 00:12:57.152
I'm sorry. man. I... I...

198
00:12:57.194 --> 00:13:01.740
I don't know what Deb did with
your mom's. uh. effects. but...

199
00:13:01.782 --> 00:13:04.618
-She'll be back.
-I have nowhere to be.

200
00:13:07.955 --> 00:13:12.042
Did you want a water or a...?
I have water. I have. um...

201
00:13:14.044 --> 00:13:15.629
No. no. no. no. I'm good.

202
00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.382
SASCHA: I drink a lot of soup.

203
00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.262
-Yeah. that's not your mom's.
-Are you an artist?

204
00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:25.305
I am. actually.
but that's not...

205
00:13:25.347 --> 00:13:27.391
That's not mine.
that's a Grigor.

206
00:13:27.432 --> 00:13:28.684
But then that...

207
00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:31.061
Yeah. That one is mine.

208
00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:36.108
-Beautiful.
-Thanks.

209
00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:40.988
Yeah. your mom wasn't much of
a reader from what I could tell.

210
00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:44.449
-Books are heavy.
-Yeah. I guess that's true.

211
00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:46.827
Every time I move.
I'm like. "Ugh. the books."

212
00:13:46.869 --> 00:13:49.663
-Do you move a lot?
-No.

213
00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:56.211
Your son?

214
00:13:56.253 --> 00:13:59.047
-Yup. that's Will.
-Does he like Deb?

215
00:13:59.089 --> 00:14:01.633
They haven't met yet.
funnily enough.

216
00:14:01.675 --> 00:14:03.927
Hmm.

217
00:14:03.969 --> 00:14:07.472
-He wasn't born at home. was he?
-No. in a hospital.

218
00:14:07.514 --> 00:14:08.932
How was that?

219
00:14:08.974 --> 00:14:12.644
I wanted a home birth. actually.
but his mother... didn't.

220
00:14:12.686 --> 00:14:16.273
Safety. sanity.
security. sterility.

221
00:14:16.315 --> 00:14:18.609
-Sure.
-Stereotypical. (CHUCKLES)

222
00:14:24.198 --> 00:14:27.409
Sorry. Oh.

223
00:14:27.451 --> 00:14:30.204
Oh. now that.
Yeah. now that is your mom's.

224
00:14:30.245 --> 00:14:32.623
I don't know what it is. though.

225
00:14:32.664 --> 00:14:34.291
Oh.

226
00:14:36.752 --> 00:14:38.879
Is that for. um...

227
00:14:41.548 --> 00:14:44.551
She was almost 50 when she
had me. Did you know that?

228
00:14:46.136 --> 00:14:48.430
She was a whore at the time.

229
00:14:48.472 --> 00:14:50.474
Sex worker. if you like.

230
00:14:50.516 --> 00:14:54.895
Yeah. She was turning tricks
until I was nine.

231
00:14:54.937 --> 00:14:56.355
If you didn't have
a lot of money.

232
00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:58.857
that's just how you got along
at Rajneeshpuram

233
00:14:58.899 --> 00:15:00.692
if you were a woman.

234
00:15:00.734 --> 00:15:03.529
Then she traded in
her hooking boots for these.

235
00:15:05.656 --> 00:15:08.075
I came to it first.

236
00:15:08.116 --> 00:15:11.161
I led her on the path.

237
00:15:11.203 --> 00:15:14.915
There was this girl in camp.
Yamuna.

238
00:15:17.084 --> 00:15:19.044
God. I loved her.

239
00:15:19.086 --> 00:15:21.463
She was pregnant
by her boyfriend Mark

240
00:15:21.505 --> 00:15:23.632
who was facing
several indictments

241
00:15:23.674 --> 00:15:25.384
for cocaine trafficking.

242
00:15:26.552 --> 00:15:28.220
As the summer got hotter

243
00:15:28.262 --> 00:15:31.223
and her belly
grew more round and full.

244
00:15:31.265 --> 00:15:34.393
I found myself by her side
more often than not.

245
00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:38.355
helping her with cleaning
and calisthenics.

246
00:15:38.397 --> 00:15:40.607
whatever was required.

247
00:15:42.568 --> 00:15:47.698
We'd talk all night long
about big subjects.

248
00:15:47.739 --> 00:15:49.783
nature of things.

249
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:55.956
Then when her time came.
I helped her.

250
00:15:57.374 --> 00:16:01.295
I was only nine years old.
but it was like

251
00:16:01.336 --> 00:16:07.134
my hands were being guided
by some unseen energy.

252
00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:10.137
I can see 'em now like daylight.

253
00:16:10.179 --> 00:16:12.681
My hands moving to her forehead.

254
00:16:12.723 --> 00:16:17.644
down to her belly. reaching
for the neck of the womb.

255
00:16:18.854 --> 00:16:20.856
Opening.

256
00:16:20.898 --> 00:16:27.529
Opening just the same way
the earth cracks and yawns.

257
00:16:27.571 --> 00:16:30.365
revealing her eternity.
(CHUCKLES)

258
00:16:34.119 --> 00:16:36.955
Hours later.
when Penka discovered us

259
00:16:36.997 --> 00:16:40.959
all wrapped up
together under the stars.

260
00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:43.045
she was so moved
by the sight of me

261
00:16:43.086 --> 00:16:45.923
still elbow-deep
in dried sanguine fluid

262
00:16:45.964 --> 00:16:49.134
that... it changed her.

263
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:54.348
We were known
all over Rajneeshpuram.

264
00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:57.017
The old midwife and her son.

265
00:16:59.353 --> 00:17:02.439
Those were heady days. by God.

266
00:17:02.481 --> 00:17:06.484
Wait. So. so...
you're a midwife?

267
00:17:07.861 --> 00:17:09.445
I'm a doula.

268
00:17:13.534 --> 00:17:14.867
Stay right there.

269
00:17:15.702 --> 00:17:17.287
Uh...

270
00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:20.665
Can I take your picture?

271
00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:23.544
-Yeah.
-(CLEARS THROAT)

272
00:17:23.585 --> 00:17:26.046
-Like this?
-Sure.

273
00:17:31.718 --> 00:17:33.345
(CAMERA CLICKS)

274
00:17:34.972 --> 00:17:38.350
How did you...
How did you know what to do?

275
00:17:38.392 --> 00:17:41.854
How did the baby know
what to do. or Yamuna?

276
00:17:41.895 --> 00:17:45.190
I mean. haven't you ever been
guided by something.

277
00:17:45.232 --> 00:17:46.608
and you just know?

278
00:17:47.651 --> 00:17:49.278
I think so.

279
00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:00.080
You've got a great eye.

280
00:18:00.831 --> 00:18:02.916
(CHUCKLES) Thanks.

281
00:18:11.383 --> 00:18:14.219
(HARMONICA PLAYING)

282
00:18:14.261 --> 00:18:15.721
(GATE SQUEAKS)

283
00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:45.209
You know. we would've made room
for her in the house.

284
00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:49.296
but she always insisted
on staying out here.

285
00:18:49.338 --> 00:18:53.383
SASCHA: She swiped it off
a blown-up convoy outside Blaj.

286
00:18:56.011 --> 00:18:58.555
I don't think
she spent a night away from it.

287
00:19:00.182 --> 00:19:03.101
This was her home. (SOBS)

288
00:19:03.143 --> 00:19:07.022
Oh. man. I'm so. so sorry.

289
00:19:07.064 --> 00:19:10.609
Oh. God. I'm embarrassing
myself. I didn't know...

290
00:19:10.651 --> 00:19:13.111
I didn't know being here
would be so hard.

291
00:19:13.153 --> 00:19:17.241
-I should've packed it up.
-Please. please don't.

292
00:19:17.282 --> 00:19:19.326
Just...

293
00:19:19.368 --> 00:19:20.327
I feel like if we take it down.

294
00:19:20.369 --> 00:19:21.954
then that will be
the last of her.

295
00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.998
She was a great lady.

296
00:19:27.543 --> 00:19:30.420
I really regret taking that job
in Kinshasa.

297
00:19:30.462 --> 00:19:32.339
SILVIO:
Well. you couldn't have known.

298
00:19:33.674 --> 00:19:35.342
She was 90.

299
00:19:38.512 --> 00:19:39.847
Listen.

300
00:19:41.348 --> 00:19:45.227
Why don't you just. you know...
why don't you stay?

301
00:19:45.269 --> 00:19:48.105
No. no. I couldn't.
Not without Deb's approval.

302
00:19:48.146 --> 00:19:50.691
We're actually in a bind here.
We could really use the help.

303
00:19:50.732 --> 00:19:52.985
-You'd be helping us out.
-How far along is she?

304
00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:54.945
She's six weeks out
from her window.

305
00:19:54.987 --> 00:19:55.946
The home stretch.

306
00:19:55.988 --> 00:19:57.489
SILVIO:
You could stay here in the tent.

307
00:19:57.531 --> 00:19:59.074
if you'd be comfortable.
of course.

308
00:19:59.116 --> 00:20:00.909
You know that thing
you just said

309
00:20:00.951 --> 00:20:03.120
about being guided by something?

310
00:20:04.621 --> 00:20:06.540
That's how this feels.

(LAUGHS)

314
00:20:16.633 --> 00:20:18.427
Do you have a bag or anything?

315
00:20:18.468 --> 00:20:20.470
No. I'll borrow.

316
00:20:20.512 --> 00:20:22.097
OK. I mean.
we have plenty of things.

317
00:20:22.139 --> 00:20:24.641
I mean. we look like
we're about the same size.

-SASCHA: Are you getting them?
-SILVIO: Yeah. No. Yeah.

323
00:20:33.317 --> 00:20:34.610
I was curious because.

324
00:20:34.651 --> 00:20:37.279
uh. my ladies often
say that they need that.

325
00:20:37.321 --> 00:20:39.615
But their guys. they get
a little nervous about it.

326
00:20:39.656 --> 00:20:41.200
especially
in the third trimester.

327
00:20:41.241 --> 00:20:44.036
-SILVIO: Oh. yeah. No. we're...
-SASCHA: No. but it's important.

328
00:20:44.077 --> 00:20:47.206
-...by stimulating orgasms.
-I did not know that.

329
00:20:47.247 --> 00:20:48.415
Got some shopping in.

330
00:20:48.457 --> 00:20:49.791
-Hey!
-Hi.

331
00:20:49.833 --> 00:20:51.627
-Hi.
-Hello.

332
00:20:51.668 --> 00:20:53.504
-Uh...
-Here. let me.

333
00:20:53.545 --> 00:20:56.423
Oh. no. you don't... What. are
you putting this guy to work?

334
00:20:56.465 --> 00:20:58.884
(WHISPERS)
You what? He's a what?

335
00:20:58.926 --> 00:21:01.220
Yeah. the tent's still up
so I hired him.

336
00:21:01.261 --> 00:21:03.889
-Oh. my God. are you insane?
-No. why would you say that?

337
00:21:03.931 --> 00:21:05.349
Because you didn't even ask me.

338
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:06.808
But I figured
we needed somebody.

339
00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:08.602
But we said that
we were gonna talk about this.

340
00:21:08.644 --> 00:21:10.395
-SASCHA: Hey. Deb?
-Yeah?

341
00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:11.980

-Milk. please.
-Done and done.

343
00:21:15.192 --> 00:21:17.069
Do you need help

00:30:35.919 --> 00:30:40.841
and that's apparently over now
because I'm... a blimp.

515
00:30:42.759 --> 00:30:44.469
You could be the blimp
at the game

516
00:30:44.511 --> 00:30:47.264
instead of one of
the players. you know?

517
00:30:48.056 --> 00:30:50.184
Just floating over.

518
00:30:51.977 --> 00:30:53.645
Was that supposed
to make me feel better?

519
00:30:53.687 --> 00:30:54.730
Yes.

520
00:30:54.771 --> 00:30:57.357
So. yeah. you know.
I like dog babies.

521
00:30:57.399 --> 00:30:58.859
but I liked
human babies more.

522
00:30:58.901 --> 00:31:01.153
And that's kinda where I settled
and ended up here.

523
00:31:01.195 --> 00:31:04.156
Everything else is looking good.
Do you wanna know the sex?

524
00:31:04.823 --> 00:31:06.325
Um...

525
00:31:07.367 --> 00:31:09.244
Yeah.

526
00:31:09.286 --> 00:31:11.997
Fuck it. What are we working
with? Poker or fireplace?

527
00:31:13.332 --> 00:31:15.667
-Huh?
-Like a poker.

528
00:31:17.377 --> 00:31:19.087
(LAUGHS)

529
00:31:20.756 --> 00:31:23.175
Strange joke.

530
00:31:23.217 --> 00:31:24.718
-Thanks.
-DOCTOR: Um...

531
00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:27.304
Yeah. things are a little turned
around here.

532
00:31:27.346 --> 00:31:29.181
So let's see if we can get
some movement.

533
00:31:29.223 --> 00:31:31.183
(WHISPERS) Hello. baby. come on.

534
00:31:31.225 --> 00:31:34.645
Come on. Sprinkle a little dust.

535
00:31:36.063 --> 00:31:37.606
Come on.

536
00:31:37.648 --> 00:31:40.108
Oh! See? There we are.
Right there.

537
00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:43.904
You have
a very distinctive. um...

538
00:31:43.946 --> 00:31:45.447
A dick?

539
00:31:45.489 --> 00:31:49.493
Uh. yes.
You're gonna have a boy.

540
00:31:49.535 --> 00:31:52.162

-What?

541
00:31:53.497 --> 00:31:54.706
SASCHA: Congrats.

542
00:31:55.707 --> 00:31:58.168
DOCTOR: Uh... so. yeah. I...

543
00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:03.715
I know there's some talk
about having this baby at home.

544
00:32:03.757 --> 00:32:04.883
which. hey. that's fine.

545
00:32:04.925 --> 00:32:08.136
I just wanted to talk about
the risks. given that you're...

546
00:32:08.178 --> 00:32:10.848
-Old as fuck?
-No. no. You're in great shape.

547
00:32:10.889 --> 00:32:12.975
It's just we should talk about.
um...

548
00:32:13.016 --> 00:32:14.601
there is a risk
of complications.

549
00:32:14.643 --> 00:32:16.353
-DEB: Right.
-We should talk about it.

550
00:32:16.395 --> 00:32:18.230
No. I do remember this
from last time.

551
00:32:18.272 --> 00:32:21.191
It's just that my partner Silvio
doesn't...

552
00:32:21.233 --> 00:32:24.278
-He's... No. um...
-Hm-hmm.

553
00:32:24.319 --> 00:32:27.239
I just need more time to make
a decision. Is that cool?

554

Whatever is cool.

555
00:32:29.116 --> 00:32:31.785
You're cool. Everybody's cool.
Yes. take your time.

556
00:32:31.827 --> 00:32:33.954
We can talk about it
next time you come in.

557
00:32:33.996 --> 00:32:35.414
OK. Thank you.

558
00:32:35.455 --> 00:32:37.082

-OK. Thank you. Dr. Zonkowski.
-Be blessed. See ya. Bye.

560
00:32:42.045 --> 00:32:44.590
I'm gonna run to the bathroom.
I'll meet you outside.

561
00:32:44.631 --> 00:32:45.966

Yeah. OK. No prob.
What's going on?

568
00:33:07.362 --> 00:33:09.489
What's your C-section rate?

569
00:33:13.869 --> 00:33:16.872
You look familiar. Where you
in the room with. uh. Debbie?

570

-Deb. yeah.

571
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:21.043
And you are? Who are you again?

572
00:33:21.084 --> 00:33:23.378
-Are you Dad?
-I'm the doula.

573
00:33:24.671 --> 00:33:26.423
The doula.

574
00:33:27.257 --> 00:33:29.009
Yeah. OK.

575
00:33:30.427 --> 00:33:33.096
Don't get me wrong.
You say that you're a doula.

576
00:33:33.138 --> 00:33:36.892
And I can respect that. Um...

577
00:33:36.934 --> 00:33:40.395
-But in all honesty. we don't...
-What's your rate. though?

578
00:33:41.355 --> 00:33:42.940
There are no numbers on that

579
00:33:42.981 --> 00:33:44.900
and we see this
more and more now.

580
00:33:44.942 --> 00:33:47.819
Not to be rude. if you
really want to advocate for her.

581
00:33:47.861 --> 00:33:49.738
you should tell her
to have the baby here.

582
00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:51.448
Are you a cutter?

583
00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:54.409
-I don't know who you...
-What's the cut-off time?

584
00:33:54.451 --> 00:33:56.453
-The cut-off time?
-Eight hours?

-Hey.

-DEB: Uh. he had a meeting.

590
00:34:12.636 --> 00:34:14.388

Was he excited about this baby?

591
00:34:14.429 --> 00:34:16.264

-SASCHA: And you?

592
00:34:16.306 --> 00:34:17.724

593
00:34:17.766 --> 00:34:22.521
I mean. it's a lot. We weren't
together very long before we...

594
00:34:22.563 --> 00:34:24.356
-Before I...
-How long?

595
00:34:24.398 --> 00:34:25.607
Three weeks.

596
00:34:25.649 --> 00:34:28.944
-I know. It's Wack City. right?
-I don't know about Wack City.

597
00:34:28.985 --> 00:34:30.862
but judging from the way
you play basketball.

598
00:34:30.904 --> 00:34:33.532
I think you might have
borderline personality disorder.

599
00:34:33.574 --> 00:34:34.783
Excuse me? Yo.

600
00:34:34.824 --> 00:34:37.703
Silvio didn't ask me
before hiring you.

601
00:34:37.744 --> 00:34:39.871
-Did you know that?
-I did not.

602
00:34:39.913 --> 00:34:42.541
Yeah. so I don't know
what you were talking about

603
00:34:42.583 --> 00:34:43.583
with the doctor in there.

604
00:34:43.625 --> 00:34:46.170
But if you could. like.
not do that.

605
00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:49.214
-Do what?
-Like. have conversations...

606
00:34:49.255 --> 00:34:52.176
(WHISPERS) ...about my pregnancy
without me being in the room.

607
00:34:52.217 --> 00:34:55.679
-Of course.
-Because it's just...

608
00:34:55.721 --> 00:34:57.264
-No. I get it.
-...not a cool thing.

609
00:34:57.306 --> 00:34:59.558
Just so you know. I wasn't.

610
00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:02.102
Really? What were you
talking to him about then?

611
00:35:02.144 --> 00:35:04.646
I thought he might've been
the brother of someone

612
00:35:04.688 --> 00:35:06.940
I went to midwifery school with.

613
00:35:09.151 --> 00:35:12.821

literally translates to?

for the woman

when her teeth
are gritted in pain.

00:35:19.369 --> 00:35:21.622

it was like a helper slave.

618
00:35:21.663 --> 00:35:25.375

need me anymore. I will vanish.

a hospital birth

-Seriously?

Is Silvio having this baby?

624
00:35:41.391 --> 00:35:43.435

having the baby?

in the bottom of this sea

leading farther down to an even
more unfathomable depth.

in this crack.

has dissolved into the crack.

impression of him? Is he bad?

-I wouldn't say bad.
-What would you say?

00:38:46.034 --> 00:38:47.619
What's a doula?

684
00:38:47.661 --> 00:38:50.205
Oh. well. a doula.
the literal translation...

685
00:38:50.247 --> 00:38:53.292
-Who are you talking to?
-Oh. Deb. Come here. it's Will.

686
00:38:53.333 --> 00:38:56.378
Hey. Will. this is Deb.

687
00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:57.588
Come on.

688
00:39:02.092 --> 00:39:03.468
-WILL: Hi.
-Hi.

689
00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:06.972
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too. Will.

690
00:39:07.014 --> 00:39:10.142
Am I gonna have a little sister
or a little brother?

691
00:39:10.184 --> 00:39:12.936
They don't know.
It's gonna be a surprise.

692
00:39:12.978 --> 00:39:14.354
Well. cool.

693
00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:19.610
Uh. Will. did you get
the basketball that I sent?

694
00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.988
-Oh. yeah.
-Great.

695
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:24.907
Have you... Did you try it out?

696
00:39:24.948 --> 00:39:27.367
-Yeah. it's big.
-Yeah. well. it's full size.

697
00:39:27.409 --> 00:39:29.536
That's my idea. If you learn
to play on that one.

698
00:39:29.578 --> 00:39:30.704
by the time your hands grow.

699
00:39:30.746 --> 00:39:32.664
you're gonna be playing
like James Harden.

700
00:39:32.706 --> 00:39:34.208
It's all about ball control.

701
00:39:34.249 --> 00:39:36.835
My uncle says
James Harden is a nihilist.

702
00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:40.631
Your uncle's a wise man.

703
00:39:41.924 --> 00:39:43.800
Uh. well. we should
play together.

704
00:39:43.842 --> 00:39:45.969
You know.
when I'm not so pregnant.

705
00:39:46.011 --> 00:39:48.639
Oh. Will the new house
have a hoop?

706
00:39:49.765 --> 00:39:51.266
The new house?

707
00:39:51.308 --> 00:39:54.269
I cannot believe that you are
trying to justify this now.

708
00:39:54.311 --> 00:39:57.022
You are so out of touch. my man.

709
00:39:57.064 --> 00:39:59.316
God. first the doula. now this?

710
00:39:59.358 --> 00:40:01.860
No. Look. I'm just trying to do
the right thing by my kid. Deb.

711
00:40:01.902 --> 00:40:02.819
His mother is a nightmare.

712
00:40:02.861 --> 00:40:04.863
His mother told you
to take him.

713
00:40:04.905 --> 00:40:07.908
(INDISTINCT ARGUING)

714
00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:11.662
DEB: She said. "Jump."
and you said. "How high?"

715
00:40:11.703 --> 00:40:14.039
SILVIO: That is not
what happened.

716
00:40:14.081 --> 00:40:16.583
I promise
I will make this up to you.

717
00:40:16.625 --> 00:40:18.544
How? (LAUGHS)

718
00:40:18.585 --> 00:40:19.753
Look. I'm just doing that thing

719
00:40:19.795 --> 00:40:22.714
where I wanna
take care of everyone. you know?

720
00:40:22.756 --> 00:40:24.424
-(GROANS)
-I just...

721
00:40:25.133 --> 00:40:26.927
Will you let me try?

722
00:40:26.969 --> 00:40:30.097
Let me try.
I promise I won't let you down.

723
00:40:33.433 --> 00:40:34.560
Bro.

724
00:40:34.601 --> 00:40:37.896
Swirling. no longer a maiden.

725
00:40:37.938 --> 00:40:41.567
And feel the sway right there.
just the sway.

726
00:40:41.608 --> 00:40:44.027
And one. two. three. push up.

727
00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:48.156
Kick away your old self.
It's not about you anymore.

728
00:40:48.198 --> 00:40:50.742
That is your old life.
That is your maiden self.

729
00:40:50.784 --> 00:40:55.289
You're pushing her away
to welcome in the mother.

730
00:40:55.330 --> 00:40:58.584
Breathe in. Breathe out.
breathe in. breathe out.

731
00:41:00.002 --> 00:41:03.797
Breathe in. (GRUNTS)
Breathe out.

732
00:41:04.965 --> 00:41:09.803
So today... it was about work.

733
00:41:09.845 --> 00:41:15.851
Because it is work
to bring a baby into the world.

734
00:41:15.893 --> 00:41:17.436
Or babies.

735
00:41:17.477 --> 00:41:19.730
Sometimes it's twice the work.
I have twins.

736
00:41:19.771 --> 00:41:23.358
Breathe in. (LAUGHS)
Breathe out.

737
00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:28.030
But mammas are strong
and mammas are capable.

738
00:41:28.071 --> 00:41:31.950
And that's why today
for closing words...

739
00:41:33.202 --> 00:41:36.872
I wanna ask everyone
what do you think

740
00:41:36.914 --> 00:41:40.209
will take a little bit of work

741
00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:43.670
to bring these babies
into this world?

742
00:41:49.051 --> 00:41:50.302
Chelsea.

743
00:41:50.344 --> 00:41:54.264
I'm just a little concerned
about the... the pooping part.

744
00:41:54.306 --> 00:41:57.976
My cousin Claire.
just... all over.

745
00:41:59.895 --> 00:42:04.316
Well. I'm scared about. um...
after it's here.

746
00:42:04.358 --> 00:42:07.027
Perineum tear.

747
00:42:07.069 --> 00:42:09.321
I'm really. really. really
scared about it.

748
00:42:09.363 --> 00:42:13.784
and I really wanna
have this baby naturally.

749
00:42:14.493 --> 00:42:16.954
So I'm just gonna...

750
00:42:16.995 --> 00:42:21.750
get really strong down there
and...

751
00:42:21.792 --> 00:42:25.003
-and really flexible.
-TUTOR: Yes!

752
00:42:25.045 --> 00:42:27.130
So brave.

753
00:42:29.967 --> 00:42:33.345
-Deb.
-Me?

754
00:42:33.387 --> 00:42:35.347
How are you. dear Deb?

755
00:42:35.389 --> 00:42:38.392
I'm... good. dear Gracie.

756
00:42:38.433 --> 00:42:41.562
So what's gonna take
a little hard work on your end?

757
00:42:41.603 --> 00:42:42.813
Uh...

758
00:42:42.855 --> 00:42:46.400
Shit. Um. gosh. I...

759
00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:50.320
I really hate this part.
Can I just skip?

760
00:42:50.362 --> 00:42:52.573
You can't skip.

761
00:42:52.614 --> 00:42:56.451
-What? Yes. I can.
-No. you can't.

762
00:42:56.493 --> 00:43:00.330
-Where is that written?
-Oh. it's not written anywhere.

763
00:43:00.372 --> 00:43:02.457
We're a circle of mammas.

764
00:43:02.499 --> 00:43:03.917
So we. you know.

765
00:43:03.959 --> 00:43:07.087
we didn't actually get any pens
and write it down.

766
00:43:07.129 --> 00:43:09.381
We don't have any rules
that we wrote.

767
00:43:09.423 --> 00:43:11.216
Yeah. I'm just...
I'm gonna skip.

768
00:43:11.258 --> 00:43:13.260
You can't skip things!

769
00:43:15.596 --> 00:43:17.973
It can't be skipped.

770
00:43:19.224 --> 00:43:21.351
You can't skip.

771
00:43:26.064 --> 00:43:30.402
Uh. (EXHALES) My...

772
00:43:30.444 --> 00:43:33.155
My boyfriend's kid
is moving in with us

773
00:43:33.197 --> 00:43:35.407
and that's not inherently
a bad thing.

774
00:43:35.449 --> 00:43:37.743
He seems like
a really sweet kid.

775
00:43:37.784 --> 00:43:41.747
but I'm just
a little bit worried that the...

776
00:43:41.788 --> 00:43:47.419
the baby is gonna be...
lost in all of this.

777
00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:52.841
Actually that. that's. um...
that's not true.

778
00:43:52.883 --> 00:43:55.093
I'm not worried that the baby's
gonna be forgotten.

779
00:43:55.135 --> 00:43:59.890
I'm just worried that I'm
going to be... forgotten.

780
00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:04.520
You know. Silvio has got me
knocked up and now what am I?

781
00:44:04.561 --> 00:44:07.940
I'm just like a...
I'm a hostage in my own body.

782
00:44:07.981 --> 00:44:10.317
I'm a goddamn delivery vessel.

783
00:44:12.986 --> 00:44:17.491
But. uh. I've got Sasch.
you know. my doula.

784
00:44:17.533 --> 00:44:19.159
So that's chill.

785
00:44:19.952 --> 00:44:21.745
Smells a little musty.

786
00:44:21.787 --> 00:44:26.500
But whatever. there. I shared.

are gonna love that.

(LAUGHS) Yeah. well. don't you
worry about Dr. Zonkowski.

793
00:45:30.189 --> 00:45:31.982
I'll take care of him.

794
00:45:39.781 --> 00:45:41.867
And I'm so excited to use those.
They're robot boobs.

795
00:45:41.909 --> 00:45:43.535
I don't want robot boobs.

796
00:45:43.577 --> 00:45:45.662
-OK. I'll put 'em down.
-It's from me.

for ze baby.

ze baby into ze food.

-Grind the baby and eat it.

-That's great.
-It's for food for the baby.

then we can just return it.
