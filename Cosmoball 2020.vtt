3
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.640
Many years ago my son...

4
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.920
Our leader. Belo.

5
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.720
battled against the destroyer...

6
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.880
Cherno

7
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.320
Victory was within our grasp.

8
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.720
when the evil Cherno

9
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.120
forged a terrifying weapon...

10
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.200
the Wave Eater!

11
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.160
The weapon so powerful.

12
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.920
it destroyed everything
it came in contact with.

13
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.960
Hope faded

14
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.320
Until the Great Belo
gathered unique fighters

15
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.920
with the ability to teleport

16
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.080
and attacked Cherno!

17
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.600
Boom! Boom!

18
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.200
Cherno's ship crashed
into Earth's Moon

19
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.480
splitting it into pieces.

20
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.080
While Cherno escaped in a pod...
that pierced the Earth's core.

21
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.840
and was trapped deep under the ground.

22
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.360
Which is where we've chained him.

23
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.760
The Earth suffered.

24
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.160
The ice caps turned to deserts.
and the deserts froze over.

25
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.480
New diseases and hardships emerged.

26
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.040
So the Galactic Council
turned to the civilized universe

27
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.080
asking them to help the humans.

28
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.800
Imagine. my son.

29
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.520
that just before the disaster.

30
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.720
Earthlings had grown so close
to a new stage in their evolution...

31
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.120
and three formidable Athletes

32
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.080
born with the ability to teleport.

33
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.720
emerged on the little blue planet.

34
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.400
Remember this. my son.

35
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.640
your father guards

36
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.240
the most dangerous prisoner
in the universe!

37
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.040
I know your mother is worried...

38
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.200
...but Cherno's power weakens...

39
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.880
and soon your father
will return home to you.

40
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.080
This time for good...

41
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.800
Message delivered to your son.

42
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.120
Stop! Bucket filled. Next! Pump.

43
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.400
Pump!

44
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.680
Stop!

45
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.960
Bucket filled!

46
00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.240
Next!

47
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.240
Pump!

48
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.560
One...

49
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.200
Step forward

50
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.040
Two...

51
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.680
Three...

52
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.040
Watch out!

53
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.800
Why does this stuff always
happen to me?

54
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.800
Ah!

55
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.880
I told you not to stand next to him!

56
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.080
Weird stuff always happens to him!

57
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.000
No... it's just that lizard
over there...

58
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.080
And I'm afraid of... lizards...

59
00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.080
Thank you...

60
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.960
Want your water or not?

61
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.680
He's bad luck. Just take it and go.
Get out of here.

62
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.160
Thank you. Thank you...

63
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.720
I'm just trying to find a job today...
thanks

64
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.040
There are only two left...

65
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.960
No more will be born
while I'm trapped in this pit.

66
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.120
And when they take these from me

67
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.760
this prison will turn into my grave.

68
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.360
Father

69
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.320
The protogene didn't activate.

70
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.240
Every time he's nearly killed.

71
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.040
his blood boils with adrenaline

72
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.960
but...it's... not enough.

73
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.200
I invented this protogene...

74
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:42.080
A combination of unique cells
inside a microscopic particle.

75
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:48.360
In my hands. it can bring
a new war to the entire Universe.

76
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.880
And yet it remains trapped

77
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.600
inside the body
of a pathetic Earthling!

78
00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.280
Stop scaring him!

79
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.680
Go and kill him!

80
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.560
Before his death

81
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.040
the protogene will ignite.

82
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.520
Get out.

83
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.880
Don't fail me.

84
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.320
My perfect creation.

85
00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.400
3:3!

86
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.680
And as always we are outnumbered!

87
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.360
But one day a 4th Athlete
will finally arise among us

88
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.440
The rules as you all know are simple:

89
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.120
each team must kick the ball
five times

90
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.760
...in order to open
the opposing team's goal...

91
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.920
and earn the chance to score.

92
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.200
Salvo!

93
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.440
Fan's kick knocks
the Sirusians in every direction

94
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.440
as fast as the tickets sold
for this game!

95
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.040
A terrific strike!
The Earthlings have the ball!

96
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.960
Two more hits –
and the Sirusians' goal will come open!

97
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.480
And all the way from cold.
snowed–caped Florida

98
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.600
the Earthling's Pele is now
leading with the ball!

99
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.120
Go on Pele! Give them your all!

100
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.760
Salvo!

101
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.360
Pele masterfully executes the 4th strike!

102
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.440
One more and the Sirusians' goal
will be opened!

103
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.400
Salvo!

104
00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.000
Pele intercepts the ball!

105
00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.600
And Fan moves in for the rebound.

106
00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.000
She spins like a tornado...
and strike!

107
00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.680
And give me a dog and call it Pluto!

108
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.840
And the goal is open!

109
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.280
The Sirusians' balls
will be ripped at the seams!

110
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.440
While we cheer our awesome home team!

111
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.080
Go little Fan! Pele is the one!
Natasha is our gun!

112
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.040
I need a job.
any job – come on!

113
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:27.920
Quiet!

114
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.879
I've been coming here for months!

115
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.880
I'm watching the game!

116
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.719
You're not listening to me...
I need...

117
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.680
Everybody's watching

118
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.600
And you're distracting!

119
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.280
I am not "everybody"!

120
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.120
You should work.
and stop starring at the sky

121
00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.120
Hey! What are you doing?
Hey!

122
00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.600
It's twenty years
since the moon was hit.

123
00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.880
Electricity for only an hour a day.
barely any food

124
00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.320
and all you care about is Cosmoball.

125
00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.960
A strike from Siriusian Stan

126
00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.280
As Athletes fly like bowling pins!

127
00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.360
Big foot...

128
00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.400
It almost looks like Cosmoball
is turning into Cosmobowling!

129
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.920
Wait! Here comes Natasha!

130
00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:20.880
Oh! What is he doing?

131
00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.960
It's a hit that sends
Natasha's Sputnik flying off her!

132
00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.840
She'll wanna reconnect to her Sputnik

133
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.360
her bodyarmour.
her best pal as soon as possible

134
00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.640
if she's going to get back
into the game

135
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.200
and help the humans play!

136
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.400
Helmet.

137
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.240
Pele. give me your hand!
Hand!

138
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.240
And Pele launches her into the air!

139
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.520
As Stan heads to the goal!

140
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.680
Oh my. will nothing stop
him from hitting that ball!

141
00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.760
Goal!

142
00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.440
Holy zero gravity!

143
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.120
I can barely keep my feet
on the ground!

144
00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.760
The Sirusians take the lead!

145
00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:15.920
- Goal!
- Yeah!

146
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.080
What are you supporting?
They got the score!

147
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.760
Stan is just amazing!

148
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.200
Helmet!

149
00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:39.600
Helmet!

150
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.680
You deaf?
Listen through your helmet.

151
00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:43.640
We're a team.

152
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.040
What's your problem.huh?

153
00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.680
Power fluctuation is registered.
New Wave Eater incoming. sir.

154
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.280
Very high strength reading.

155
00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:55.680
Prepare the arm!

156
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.520
Then let's grab it while it's hot.

157
00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:02.880
Roger.

158
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.400
Ahh. my creation!

159
00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.200
Switching to module 2.

160
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.800
Steady now on the transfer.
You know it's always risky.

161
00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.240
Looks like Cherno
is giving us a fight today.

162
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.400
Activate reserve.

163
00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:07.480
Initiate.

164
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.040
Connect me to Belo!
Now!

165
00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.480
Belo on the playing field!

166
00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.960
And the game is stopped!

167
00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.040
And here comes the head
of the Galactic Cosmoball league

168
00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.360
Belo! Belo!

169
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.280
Oh he's so dreamy!

170
00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.760
- But he's an alien!
- Exactly!

171
00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.600
Looks like something's wrong.

172
00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:00.240
Oh I wish I could just teleport over there
and listen to what they're saying.

173
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.000
Well. if I could teleport then I guess
I'd be the 4th Athlete

174
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.960
and standing there anyway!

175
00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:06.640
Stan.

176
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.040
Arterial overheating. Nap time.

177
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.280
No! It Looks like Stan is overheating.

178
00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.040
Sirusians are so big.
their mass makes playing on

179
00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.480
Earth's climate and magnetic field
twice as hard!

180
00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:21.800
I'm buying time.

181
00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.240
There's been a... technical difficulty.

182
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.560
Flight up high!

183
00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:07.720
Transportation sequence engaged!
Reserve energies activated!

184
00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.400
No! Noooo!

185
00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.480
It's in the tunnel.

186
00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:37.600
Back to position!

187
00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.400
Good job today!

188
00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.440
Combat mode

189
00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.400
Combat mode

190
00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.480
Combat mode

191
00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.880
HERE WE GOOOO!

192
00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.360
Salvo!

193
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:30.960
One!

194
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:32.080
Salvo!

195
00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:33.480
Two!

196
00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.680
Salvo!

197
00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:43.480
Three!

198
00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:45.360
Salvo!

199
00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.480
Four!

200
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.360
And here comes the retaliation!

201
00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:57.760
It's hard to see what's going on

202
00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.120
Stan moves in for the block...

203
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.640
but seems to be unsuccessful...

204
00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.600
– and lets Natasha make a free hit!
– Salvo!

205
00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.480
Team Earth has just made
five kicks in a row!

206
00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.120
The goal is open!

207
00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.800
Hit it. come on!

208
00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:09.640
Goal!

209
00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.400
Victory!

210
00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.480
For the first time in history.

211
00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:21.320
Earth is going to the finals!

212
00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:30.560
No!

213
00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.040
Noooo!

214
00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.760
Yes! Yes!

215
00:16:35.839 --> 00:16:37.200
I can't believe it!

216
00:16:38.479 --> 00:16:39.720
Outnumbered!

217
00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.360
With just three athletes!

218
00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.680
They still did it!

219
00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:46.440
Little Fan!

220
00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:48.600
Our Pele!

221
00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:52.159
And the captain of Team Earth – Natasha!

222
00:16:54.199 --> 00:16:55.480
Natasha!

223
00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.080
Yeah! We did it!

224
00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:05.840
Stan!

225
00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:17.320
What an incredible game. my friends!

226
00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.240
And as the public leaves the stadium...

227
00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.920
to back again tomorrow.

228
00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:28.400
I've been watching the games
for twenty years

229
00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:32.080
and every time my mouth
still hangs open like a child!

230
00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.920
Even though we played to a draw

231
00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.320
that draw ensures our team
reaches the finals.

232
00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.440
where we'll play against
the powerful Amazonians!

233
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.000
So listen well my fellow Earthling...

234
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.000
Because perhaps one of you out there...

235
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.000
who will become the fourth Athlete...

236
00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.640
our team so desperately needs.

237
00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.760
As always. believe in yourself!

238
00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.960
Goodnight. until next time.

239
00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.080
Oh man! I was sitting this close!

240
00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.160
You should have seen that face!

241
00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.200
Next time. you go!

242
00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.760
Even if there were a planet
filled with losers

243
00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.440
I'd still be the biggest loser there...

244
00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:08.960
Mom!

245
00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.000
Mom!

246
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.440
Get up. I'll help you

247
00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:27.520
Did we win?

248
00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:34.360
Am I the only person who isn't
brainwashed by that stupid game?

249
00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.600
Sit

250
00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.280
Thank you.

251
00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.880
Where's your medicine?

252
00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.840
Mom! You told me
you still had some left!

253
00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.560
I'm feeling much better.

254
00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.360
Where are you–

255
00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.160
Out of the way!

256
00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.880
This is the Police!

257
00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.600
In the name of the Moon Restoration
Nobody move!

258
00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.920
Captain! You'll have to go around!

259
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.240
It's too high!
You'll never make it!

260
00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.440
Idiot!

261
00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.520
Go!

262
00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:06.000
He's down there.

263
00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.120
Yes. sir!

264
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.040
I said...

265
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.000
It's tweedle dee and tweedle dum

266
00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.520
Ugh! Very clumsy!

267
00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.160
Vince!

268
00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.520
Wait for a run!

269
00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.080
Get him!

270
00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.920
I got him!

271
00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.000
But ended up... getting hard knocks!

272
00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.000
Ahhh!

273
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.520
I'll show you tweeddle...

274
00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:44.440
Lower!

275
00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.080
Jump!

276
00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:57.920
Come on!

277
00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.720
Stop gawking and follow me!

278
00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:12.280
Quiet!

279
00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:21.880
What is it?

280
00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.680
I think we lost them.

281
00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.400
What's next to my ear?

282
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:30.680
A lizard.

283
00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:31.400
AHHHH!

284
00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:32.520
Quiet!

285
00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:38.560
Alright! Game's over.

286
00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.600
Come out and keep your pretty
little hands in the air!

287
00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:42.080
This is your fault!

288
00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:45.720
Out! Now!

289
00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.560
I'm coming out. Don't shoot.

290
00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:02.280
Now who's tweedle dee
and tweedle dum. hmm?

291
00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.000
Where's the girl?

292
00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.840
There! She's right behind you!

293
00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.200
What? Captain!
There's no one there...

294
00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.320
Where's the girl?

295
00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:12.080
She went that way.

296
00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.440
Hey girl! Run!

297
00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.480
Drop the pills!

298
00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.240
And put your hands down!

299
00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.120
Okay! Since you asked...

300
00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.280
Too slow! Tweedle dums! Haha!

301
00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.360
I'm too old for this...

302
00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.040
Ahhhh!

303
00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.440
I need a cocktail...

304
00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.800
Moon restoration attempt number 6329.

305
00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:40.080
Attention! Unregistered teleportation!

306
00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:43.440
Unregistered teleportation!

307
00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:46.800
Ahhhh!

308
00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.400
Ah.. What...

309
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.440
Come with me. We gotta go

310
00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.120
Wait! Wait!

311
00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.080
I just died...

312
00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:58.960
Get in!

313
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.240
Down there! Go! Go!

314
00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.080
Wrong way!

315
00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:24.440
Take a seat.

316
00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:34.960
Woo–Hoo! Haha!

317
00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.840
Back there...
why did you help me?

318
00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.360
Bad stuff always happens to me...

319
00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.440
Don't need to drag
anyone else down too...

320
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:50.800
Is that right?

321
00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.720
You could've killed me
with that window stunt.

322
00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.480
So are you going to answer me?

323
00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.320
Why?

324
00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:01.560
Get off.

325
00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.800
Someone woke up
on the wrong side of bed.

326
00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.720
You know. at least I get out of bed.

327
00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.440
and don't just watch Cosmoball
like a zombie.

328
00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.120
Yeah? Who won today?

329
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.160
It was a draw.

330
00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:15.920
You're wrong.

331
00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.480
I saw it myself.

332
00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.880
You're wrong if you think
you're not a zombie.

333
00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.800
I know you watch it too!

334
00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.760
I need to help my dad
not stare at the sky.

335
00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.480
Why are you staring at me?

336
00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.800
I've never met anyone else
who doesn't like Cosmoball...

337
00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.120
Anya!

338
00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:52.760
Is your dad sick or something?

339
00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.560
Been helping as long as I can

340
00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:55.920
We have a lot in common.

341
00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.320
One thing ain't much.

342
00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.680
No. I mean my mother is sick too.

343
00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.280
I'm going to ask you a question...

344
00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:03.600
And don't tell me to get lost

345
00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.280
What is your name?

346
00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.240
I'd like to see you again

347
00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.000
You going somewhere?

348
00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.080
I need to go back
to check on my mom.

349
00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.160
You're squishing my hand.

350
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.240
Oh. sorry!

351
00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:21.960
Not gonna get lost. right?

352
00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:23.400
No!

353
00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:26.600
Anton

354
00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.200
Hmm... His flask.

355
00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.000
Speak.

356
00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.120
Father...

357
00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.480
Finally I did it!

358
00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:54.200
He teleported!
The protogene has activated!

359
00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.520
This... is a clump of his hair.

360
00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.280
It's perfect!

361
00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:45.640
Hahaha!

362
00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:48.720
What?

363
00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.120
It's not enough.

364
00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.840
But that's everything
I was able to get.

365
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.160
And you didn't kill him?

366
00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:08.280
I did what I could.
The protogene is activated now!

367
00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.720
What's the matter. my daughter?

368
00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.600
Have you grown weak?

369
00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.000
No. never!

370
00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.640
If Belo gets his hands on him.

371
00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:30.840
then my days are numbered.

372
00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.960
Yes. I remember...

373
00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.080
Our days are numbered!

374
00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:11.040
So grown–up...

375
00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:14.120
Nice to meet you.

376
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.400
Relax. Relax.
We don't mean any harm.

377
00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:21.040
Teleported!

378
00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:25.800
Congratulations.

379
00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.920
Twenty minutes ago
you teleported.

380
00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:29.280
You can now play Cosmoball!

381
00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:32.200
No. No. I don't even like Cosmoball.

382
00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:33.720
I have to take care of my mom.
She's sick.

383
00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:34.800
Calm...

384
00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:35.960
I am sorry to hear that.

385
00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.640
On my planet
we have eradicated disease...

386
00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.480
and I wish the Galactic Council
allowed passing

387
00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.360
of this ability
to the less developed civilizations.

388
00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.520
Well. she was healthy
until your ships showed up.

389
00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.600
I hate Cosmoball.

390
00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:47.720
What am I missing?

391
00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.800
If that is all. you can go.

392
00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:56.280
No! Go! Leave!
Is that your life philosophy?

393
00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:57.680
Yeah

394
00:31:58.520 --> 00:31:59.600
No. thank you.

395
00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.000
What do you want from me. anyway?

396
00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:05.160
Honestly?

397
00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:06.720
I like you

398
00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:12.520
Teleported!

399
00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:15.800
All we have is now.
Might as well be honest.

400
00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:18.920
You know...

401
00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:20.600
Girls like you...

402
00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:23.960
...you're every guy's dream.

403
00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:24.960
I'd have never thought–

404
00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.800
Hands up! We've got you now!

405
00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.880
You're under arrested for the robbery...

406
00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:34.400
of... a...

407
00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.040
Well. you're not gonna help anyone
if you're locked up behind bars.

408
00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:50.240
Better start liking Cosmoball.

409
00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.720
What? He doesn't like Cosmoball?

410
00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.360
We'll find a cure for your mom.

411
00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.120
Natasha.

412
00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:58.880
We have to.

413
00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:09.080
Deal!

414
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.200
Deal!

415
00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.480
The stadium–ship is actually
a living organism.

416
00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:28.440
like a flower.

417
00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.280
I designed and engineered it

418
00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.960
to look like your Earth's dandelion
which is actually what we call it.

419
00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.000
Isn't she beautiful?

420
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.240
Get in!

421
00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.120
The dandelion will scan
for anything dangerous

422
00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.280
and eliminate it
before it enters its core.

423
00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:11.400
Foreign contaminant detected.

424
00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.560
Foreign containment destroyed.

425
00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:21.320
But... It was just a candy bar...

426
00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:25.080
I was actually...
looking forward to eating that later...

427
00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.040
It must have detected
some dangerous ingredients

428
00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:29.120
Better you didn't eat it.

429
00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:08.480
We are now going to be taking
a sample of your genetic material

430
00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:10.480
to fuse it with our microchips

431
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.200
and create a bio mechanical equivalent
of your neural connections.

432
00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:17.680
The result would be a droid
that we call Sputniks.

433
00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.040
Don't worry. we all have one.

434
00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.520
Look. He's waking up.

435
00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.080
Lizard...

436
00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:46.920
Say something
so he can identify you

437
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.640
and know that you are
one and the same.

438
00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:49.720
Seriously?

439
00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.160
Tell him peek–a–boo.

440
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:56.840
Peek–a–boo...

441
00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:01.880
Nice.

442
00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:05.480
What should I say?

443
00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.040
Something like peek–a–coo–coo

444
00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.480
I don't know what...

445
00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:09.520
There he goes!

446
00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:13.680
Careful. he's a newborn.
Be gentle with him.

447
00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:14.600
Be quiet!

448
00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:16.760
Let him concentrate
or we won't hear his name.

449
00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:26.360
When he senses your connection.
he'll tell you his name is.

450
00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.120
This is so weird.

451
00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:42.280
The same blood
that flows through you...

452
00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.640
flows through him.

453
00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:45.200
Tell him you're one.

454
00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:46.400
What do you mean?

455
00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:48.520
Say 'We be of one blood. ye and I.'

456
00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:49.400
Huh?

457
00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:50.640
Mowgli said that.

458
00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.880
Who the heck is Mowgli?

459
00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.520
Get it off! No! Ahh!

460
00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:59.120
You scared him.

461
00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.320
Great. that went well.

462
00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.120
Well. that could have gone worse.

463
00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.440
Right. time to train!

464
00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:10.400
Activate!

465
00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:28.640
Stepping in here makes
everyone nervous

466
00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:29.320
fear not.

467
00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:33.280
We'll train with a ball that's
only minimally charged.

468
00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:45.000
So now what? Do I hit it?

469
00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.120
Correct.

470
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.160
Oh boy...

471
00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:52.600
OK. another one.

472
00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:55.040
Of course.

473
00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:06.040
In order for you to strike the ball

474
00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.080
you need to match its speed

475
00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:09.000
and to do that.

476
00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:13.360
you'll have to learn to control
your teleportation skills.

477
00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.800
Which were activated before a truck hit you.

478
00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:17.120
That's right

479
00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:18.280
I almost died.

480
00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:23.920
So it's fear
that caused your teleportation.

481
00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:28.600
I must return you to that state.

482
00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:32.440
OK. You wanna fight?
Is that it?

483
00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:39.440
Don't stop! That's it! That's it!

484
00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:46.520
Haha! I got away from that one.
I teleported.

485
00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:49.320
That hurt.

486
00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:53.480
You almost teleported.
But it's uncontrolled.

487
00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.640
In time you will learn how
to take charge and command your powers.

488
00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:57.840
Very well.
That's enough for your first day.

489
00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:00.600
Show me how?

490
00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.000
I'm afraid I can't do that.

491
00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.440
I don't have the ability to jump.

492
00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:04.440
Maybe I can help?

493
00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:07.840
Hug me.

494
00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:09.800
Uhhh. Why would I do that?

495
00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:13.160
I just figured that
if I teleported with you

496
00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:14.600
it would help you figure out
how it might work?

497
00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:17.600
Is there some kind of a middle ground
between carrot and stick?

498
00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:18.600
What's that?

499
00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:20.920
Hey! What's your problem?

500
00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:22.800
What did you say?

501
00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:29.040
You're not falling down
because I'm teleporting us

502
00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:30.920
to the same place at
a high frequency.

503
00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.280
You see – it isn't scary to hug!

504
00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:48.360
No! No! No!
Give me your hand!

505
00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:50.240
Teleport now
or get splattered!

506
00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.200
No! I can't do it!

507
00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.720
Concentrate. Anton.
You have to try.

508
00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:58.200
No. I can't! Ahhh!

509
00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:06.040
Are you crazy?
You could have killed me!

510
00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.640
You can't blame a girl for trying.

511
00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:08.680
That is enough! No more today.

512
00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:11.240
Wait.

513
00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:13.520
Let's do it again.

514
00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.080
Woo–hoo–hoo!
Now it's my turn!

515
00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.520
If heights and fights
didn't freak you out –

516
00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:19.520
let's give you something
a little more intense!

517
00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:38.640
Yes! That's right!

518
00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:40.920
Choose the point in space
and teleport to it!

519
00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:46.960
Again!

520
00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:55.600
Don't stop now! Go!

521
00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:58.280
Look! He has a blue trail!

522
00:40:59.120 --> 00:40:59.960
It's unusual for Earthlings!

523
00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:02.960
Controlled teleportation...
on the first day! Ha!

524
00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:05.360
OK. let's do this!

525
00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.200
Now hit the ball!

526
00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.720
And kick it away from you
if you can.

527
00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.080
The power of teleportation
is the same for every athlete

528
00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:12.320
no matter the size.

529
00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:16.800
Here we go.

530
00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:44.880
What just happened?

531
00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:47.600
Must be a glitch!

532
00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:49.600
I saw it too.

533
00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:53.080
Let's watch it again.

534
00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:58.800
He's using his hands!

535
00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:00.360
Like a goalkeeper.

536
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.960
But we don't have a goalkeeper.

537
00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:02.880
Exactly!

538
00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:07.720
Five kicks in a row...
None of us can do that.

539
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.080
I want to try it.

540
00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:10.600
Don't even think about it.

541
00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:13.560
We need to study this.

542
00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.960
Belo. At your request.

543
00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:19.240
the Galactic Council is on the line.

544
00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:27.240
You play tomorrow.

545
00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:28.960
- Seriously?
- The first two games. yes.

546
00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:30.160
Then we'll resume his training.

547
00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.680
Fan. Pele. you're with Anton.
Natasha. come with me.

548
00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.160
You're teaching me later.

549
00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:38.880
Let's go. keeper–man.

550
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.600
We still have a problem.
We can't save his mother.

551
00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:49.800
Then she will die.

552
00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:53.160
Passing knowledge
to undeveloped nations is dangerous.

553
00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:54.720
And against the law.

554
00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.200
Then damn the foolish laws!

555
00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:00.840
Because if we don't help this man.
then we will lose the most gifted athlete

556
00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:02.480
I've ever encountered.

557
00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:04.920
His power is unbelievable.

558
00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.400
Beyond anything I have seen.

559
00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:09.440
His ability to teleport exceeds
that of every other Athlete

560
00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:12.120
and he has yet
to untap its full potential.

561
00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:13.200
This is...

562
00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:16.600
perhaps the next grand step
in humankind's evolution.

563
00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:20.200
it is our duty
to help and heal his mother.

564
00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.000
It is the right thing to do.

565
00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:25.240
With all due respect -

566
00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:27.920
So. I'm going to help her
whatever you decide.

567
00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:46.880
Can I teleport to the moon?

568
00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:49.160
I told you that I liked you.

569
00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:51.480
I've never been that honest
with anyone before.

570
00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:53.680
Don't you understand what that means?

571
00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:56.600
- You are honest.
- Of course I am!

572
00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:59.360
What more do I have to say
so that my feelings can get through

573
00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:01.680
that thick skull of yours
and you'll understand?

574
00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:06.200
So can I?

575
00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:10.080
Idiot. It would take too much energy.

576
00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:11.960
You'd either be stranded in space.

577
00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:13.560
or your atoms would kind of all just go...

578
00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:16.560
...Poof. And scatter everywhere out there.

579
00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:20.600
Probably shouldn't try then...

580
00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:52.040
You're all so different.

581
00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:54.000
And I don't mean young people.

582
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.520
I'm talking about you. the Athletes.

583
00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:59.320
I was amazed to see
how easy it was for you

584
00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:02.480
to say to my son "Anton.
I like you"

585
00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:04.120
Try not to move too much.

586
00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:04.760
Sorry.

587
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:05.640
Mom?

588
00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:07.720
Feeling better?

589
00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:08.680
Yeah...

590
00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:11.080
I feel I'm getting stronger.

591
00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.120
The biggest changes will come soon.

592
00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.320
Thank you. See!

593
00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:18.840
We've been waiting 20 years
for her to get better.

594
00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:20.200
Anton...

595
00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:22.360
Don't be rude to her.

596
00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:43.240
Don't get mad at him.

597
00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:45.760
I know that all mothers say it...

598
00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.000
But... he really is special.

599
00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:52.880
I was pregnant when the Moon split.

600
00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:56.040
I felt something pierce my belly.

601
00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:58.960
Tiny needle... ding!

602
00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:04.880
He started kicking inside me.

603
00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:06.280
and then everything went quiet.

604
00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:07.720
At first I was scared.

605
00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:10.240
but then I understood it was a sign.

606
00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:23.480
You Anton?

607
00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:24.680
Yeah.

608
00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:26.000
Anya's looking for you

609
00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:28.960
Asked me. to give you this.

610
00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:30.960
She said for you to find her.

611
00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:58.720
Anya!

612
00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:04.520
It's me. Anton!

613
00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:10.760
Anything alive down here?

614
00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:12.600
Aside from the mold...

615
00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:19.640
I wanted to ask you what you're using
to help cure your father.

616
00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:28.920
You... You aren't wearing pants.

617
00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:33.040
I mean that's cool
if you don't want to wear any.

618
00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:35.640
It's your house and all...

619
00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:45.640
You're an Athlete?

620
00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:46.800
I'm not going back there!

621
00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:47.760
Cool!

622
00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:49.760
They told me they'd help my mother.
but they lied.

623
00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:50.680
Is that true?

624
00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:52.280
Belo said so.
I heard it myself!

625
00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:53.960
Is it true the stadium's a plant?

626
00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:56.600
It is.

627
00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:58.240
Here.

628
00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:00.200
My father grew this.

629
00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:04.000
It's a pod that's filled with sap that
will poison any plant from within...

630
00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:05.880
Then they'll be no Cosmoball.

631
00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:07.800
and people will stop staring at the sky.

632
00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:10.720
Or have you changed your mind?

633
00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:12.440
No. I haven't.
It's just...

634
00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:14.040
there's a system that protects the plant -

635
00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:16.360
You can't bring in anything
that will hurt it.

636
00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:18.240
Ah. right.

637
00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.200
So you changed your mind after all.

638
00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:21.920
Wait. give it back!

639
00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:23.520
Give it to me.

640
00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:27.080
Stop it!

641
00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:30.800
Can you just...

642
00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:42.440
I've waited for this.

643
00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:49.680
Anton? What are you doing?

644
00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:54.320
We can't get....
out to the city.... alone...

645
00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:56.280
How'd you find me?

646
00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:57.760
Your Sputnik did...

647
00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:01.040
Go away!

648
00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:03.480
Such a star in my basement!

649
00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:04.880
We should go. Anton.

650
00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:07.720
She's right.

651
00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:18.880
Come back soon.

652
00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:23.760
Let's go.

653
00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:42.680
Weird... I've got a strange feeling.

654
00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:45.720
It's your Sputnik warning you
about a potential threat.

655
00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:50.520
In the name of the Moon restoration.
Stop where you are!

656
00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:52.800
Careful. sir or you'll trip and fall!

657
00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:55.000
The probability of danger
is less than 4 percent.

658
00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:56.840
which is why the Sputniks
didn't activate battle mode.

659
00:49:58.440 --> 00:49:59.480
It told you all that?

660
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:00.720
Yes.

661
00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:03.800
Stop right there!
You're under arrest for the robbery

662
00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:07.480
of a drugstore
and assault on a police officer.

663
00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:09.240
I'll... Get you...

664
00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:17.560
Oh shut up!

665
00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:23.000
What happens... if a Sputnik
never actually says its name?

666
00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:26.640
It could... could...

667
00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:29.040
...and cost you your life...

668
00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:33.720
One day your Sputnik will try
to warn you about a threat

669
00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:36.960
and... if you haven't
established a connection...

670
00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:38.840
No foreign objects detected.

671
00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:43.120
...it will be too late...

672
00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:45.440
Get some sleep.

673
00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:48.160
The game is more dangerous
than it may seem.

674
00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:57.080
Look! The games are starting!

675
00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:08.280
You may not comprehend the
significance of what's transpiring today.

676
00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:11.120
For now that you join the ranks
of Athletes who become

677
00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:13.040
a small but exceedingly
important part of the army...

678
00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:14.480
Yes! Army!

679
00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:17.960
One that is tasked to inspire...
not only the Earthlings...

680
00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:20.160
but the rest of...
and why am I so nervous?

681
00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:22.760
I should have prepared this speech...

682
00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:26.160
Look! The point is that from today
the Earth team

683
00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:29.680
is playing with a complete team
and I congratulate you!

684
00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:32.520
So saddle up!

685
00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:34.840
Are we horses?

686
00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:36.360
Ehem... Yes?

687
00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:38.520
I didn't teach him that.

688
00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:31.120
Relax and imagine as if you
and your Sputnik are one.

689
00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:56.240
Excellent! Now that's settled.
your job is to cover Pele.

690
00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:01.400
Can I take this off?

691
00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:02.160
Of course.

692
00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:04.360
Ask your Sputnik to do it for you.

693
00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:05.920
Now let's go! Let's go!

694
00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:08.880
Anton goes first.
The crowd is waiting!

695
00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:19.880
If you need to pee.
it's the 6th pillar on the left!

696
00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:21.000
Don't get lost coming back!

697
00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:24.960
Alright. Glove off.

698
00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:29.600
Come on. Get off.

699
00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:35.640
Don't do this to me. Come on!

700
00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:38.840
What do you want me to do?

701
00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:39.800
Pretend to care again?

702
00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:41.440
Why does that even matter?

703
00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:43.760
To care...

704
00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:47.080
Why should I care?
I grew up alone.

705
00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:49.040
No one's ever
looked out for me but me.

706
00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:50.680
I grew up on the streets.

707
00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:54.480
It's just been me and my mom.

708
00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:01.480
And you don't even have a mom...

709
00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:31.360
Yeah. they're pretty big!

710
00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:40.720
Well. look who it is.

711
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.200
They say he's cool!

712
00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:49.440
So you have a goalkeeper now?

713
00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:00.640
Heee... hello...

714
00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:03.000
You're very umm...

715
00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:04.160
Large.

716
00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:06.960
Don't run into my belly button. got it?

717
00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:13.440
I like you.

718
00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:21.200
All we have is now.
Might as well be honest. Hahaha

719
00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:23.640
Loudmouth!

720
00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:24.840
It wasn't me!

721
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.800
I told them! Sorry...

722
00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:28.600
But they promised...

723
00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:30.320
Don't worry! We're cool.

724
00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:34.280
Jokers!

725
00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:40.880
It's a super–sized event today!

726
00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:42.320
For the first time in the finals

727
00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:44.400
and for the first time
it's four of them!

728
00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:45.760
Earth's team is complete!

729
00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:49.240
And listen to that!
Can you believe it?

730
00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:51.920
Four players! That's three plus one!
Two and two!

731
00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:53.880
That makes Four players
from planet Earth!

732
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.280
What a day!
What a beautiful gorgeous day!

733
00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:57.640
We love you! Yes we do!

734
00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:59.680
We here and everyone.
without exception. envy you!

735
00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:03.120
Earthlings. Sirusians. Amazonians...

736
00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:05.160
...and all the other planets and galaxies.

737
00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:07.560
in one voice together.

738
00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:13.720
would like to welcome the new Athlete
Anton!

739
00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:18.280
Anton! Anton! Anton!

740
00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:25.040
Hold on! Is that ...? I think it's...

741
00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:30.640
They're showing Anton!

742
00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:33.720
Bless you!

743
00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:35.600
Thank you. Sorry...

744
00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:43.680
How about we grab dinner
after the game. Chickie?

745
00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:45.440
Uhh...Okay. Unless I'm dinner...

746
00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:57.920
Ready?

747
00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:40.560
Anton. what's wrong?

748
00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:49.000
Salvo!

749
00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:56.600
What's little chickie doing
sitting down there?

750
00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:00.200
What's going on?
What's he doing?

751
00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:03.320
Get up... Get up... Get up...

752
00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:04.960
Anton. are you OK?

753
00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:09.160
His vital signs all seem normal.

754
00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:12.800
Get up already!

755
00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:19.000
What are you doing? Stop sitting!

756
00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:20.960
Booo!

757
00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:29.440
He's a quitter! He's a quitter!

758
00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:35.040
What the hell!

759
00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:39.320
What is this fool doing?

760
00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:42.240
Let's not jump to conclusions quite so fast
getting call the boy a quitter

761
00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:45.840
after all. this is
his first game of Cosmoball.

762
00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:48.000
It might just be a technical malfunction.

763
00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:53.400
Get up. I'd like you
to come with me please.

764
00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:55.040
I'm not going anywhere!

765
00:59:57.320 --> 00:59:58.360
You lied to me.

766
00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:02.680
You said you were going to help my mom
and that all was just a lie.

767
01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:05.200
See for yourself. Anton.

768
01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:09.160
Belo got official permission from the Council
to use extraterrestrial medicine.

769
01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:10.600
She is already better.

770
01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.040
When was the last time you saw her
so energized?

771
01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:14.720
Who is... she talking to?

772
01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:16.880
Come with me.

773
01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:32.880
I never believed that I would play
a rookie on his first day.

774
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.360
Much less show him this.

775
01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:49.880
What you've been practicing with

776
01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:53.600
is a holographic ball
I created to train Athletes...

777
01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:55.760
So they'd be ready...
for the real thing.

778
01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.840
This weapon is called a Wave Eater.

779
01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:10.000
It was forged to consume energy.

780
01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:15.000
It cannot be destroyed.

781
01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:18.160
Only discharged
with the five strikes of an Athlete.

782
01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:21.240
Millions were killed
before we discovered this method.

783
01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:22.200
Killed?

784
01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:24.400
Yes. Anton! It was war.

785
01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:26.480
This stadium is not just a gaming center.

786
01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:28.280
it also discharges Wave Eaters.

787
01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:31.240
For years now we've been trying
to save Earth from total destruction.

788
01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:33.880
Why are they attacking us?

789
01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:35.080
The Wave Eaters are a weapon.

790
01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:38.000
Controlled and commanded
by their creator - Cherno.

791
01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:44.440
He is imprisoned right here.
deep underground...

792
01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:46.360
...Right under this stadium.

793
01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:47.720
He's scientist... Like me.

794
01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:50.640
But he used this power
for his own personal gain...

795
01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:53.200
...and turned his own experiments
into weapons that

796
01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:56.320
threaten any life that was not
his own creation.

797
01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:58.240
Harnessing the power of the stars.

798
01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:00.000
he would turn the entire universe...

799
01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:03.800
into a playground. for his experiments.

800
01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.880
His last invention was the Protogene.

801
01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:10.040
A combination of fused gene cells

802
01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:12.520
including the power of teleportation.

803
01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:15.000
which could turn his weapon
into something unstoppable.

804
01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:16.560
So. we declared war.

805
01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:20.160
The final battle occurred
near your planet Earth.

806
01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.640
All the hardships Earth faced
in the past 20 years

807
01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:24.440
are a result of the war with Cherno.

808
01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:27.440
We won. but Cherno's lab
crashed through the ground

809
01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:28.800
and was trapped deep inside the Earth.

810
01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:30.360
where we've kept him imprisoned.

811
01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:33.480
Because Cherno hasn't escaped.
we assume his protogene

812
01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:35.480
was somehow
lost during the crash.

813
01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:40.040
You're saying that.
those balls out there

814
01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:42.880
are sometimes actually Wave Eaters
that could kill people?

815
01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.160
Why make a game out of it?

816
01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:49.320
It is easier to risk your life when you know
you are supported by millions

817
01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:52.640
even if they don't know the truth
or understand the risk.

818
01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:54.720
And as for the three…

819
01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:59.520
No... the four proud Athletes...

820
01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:02.960
You show... everyone who watches you...

821
01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:05.440
that there is something to be inspired by...

822
01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:07.600
...you give them something to hope for...

823
01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.160
Why can't we kill him?

824
01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:15.320
Drop some kind of gas into his prison
and destroy him that way.

825
01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:17.160
If we do that. then
his lab would explode

826
01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:18.760
and the planet would burst
just like the moon.

827
01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:20.680
This fact protects him.

828
01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:22.120
And the fans?

829
01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:22.840
They're safe.

830
01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:25.280
The dandelion protects them
with a force field.

831
01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.600
So if the dandelion ship was not there.

832
01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:30.640
then the crowd...

833
01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:36.240
This would happen to your entire planet
until it was a scorched wasteland.

834
01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.360
Wave Eater releasing in 1 minute.

835
01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:41.960
– OK.
– Wait.

836
01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:43.760
Let me get this straight.

837
01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:47.440
We're about to go play football
with what's essentially a nuclear bomb.

838
01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:51.680
created by an angry alien who can't be killed
and wants to take over the universe...

839
01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:55.080
and everyone else...
Thinks this is just a game...

840
01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:56.400
Is that right?

841
01:03:58.320 --> 01:03:59.680
Pretty much it. yes.

842
01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.240
I think I have to go.

843
01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:03.360
What?

844
01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:04.360
I'll be right back.

845
01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:19.120
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Faster! Faster!

846
01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.000
Thank you!

847
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:42.640
Glove off.

848
01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:10.080
Sputnik. connect me to the network.
Quick!

849
01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:14.360
OK. fifteen seconds everyone.

850
01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:26.520
Connect me to the network.
Come one!

851
01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:30.440
Everyone! The Stadium is infected!

852
01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:39.000
It's not safe here!

853
01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:40.760
Belo.

854
01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:42.720
Belo!

855
01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:45.719
The stadium's been infected!

856
01:06:17.999 --> 01:06:19.640
Emergency evacuation!

857
01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:23.840
Emergency evacuation!

858
01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:32.519
Let's get out!

859
01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:35.639
Emergency evacuation!

860
01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:46.799
We're stuck!
It won't let us go!

861
01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:50.800
It's closing!

862
01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:13.000
One!

863
01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:15.320
Natasha.

864
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:36.640
Two!

865
01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:37.720
Three!

866
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:38.520
Four!

867
01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:39.240
Too early!

868
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:42.560
No!

869
01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:48.480
Fifth!

870
01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:49.640
Five!

871
01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:07.160
Anton. Are you OK?

872
01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:12.120
We are fine!

873
01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:13.560
You did great!

874
01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:24.160
Thought you were hit...
by the Wave Eater.

875
01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:26.800
It's a miracle.
Take him to a doctor.

876
01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:29.920
Hey. chickie.

877
01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:32.760
You're the man.

878
01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:34.120
You too – I mean...

879
01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:35.160
Hey Anton!

880
01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:36.800
Sweet moves!

881
01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:40.280
Congratulations!

882
01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:47.680
Oh..

883
01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:49.080
What?

884
01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:51.000
Nothing.

885
01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:09.280
Glove off

886
01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:23.880
Sorry buddy!

887
01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:27.280
Gotta do this... on my own.

888
01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:41.760
Anya...

889
01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:48.400
Don't struggle. It's useless.

890
01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:50.240
You won't be able to talk or move.

891
01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:46.720
A virus that imitates the genetic structure
of a dandelion.

892
01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:48.800
So that's why the immune system
didn't recognize it.

893
01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.520
But how did Cherno
get it into the stadium?

894
01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:55.360
Anton!

895
01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:58.600
Battle alarm!

896
01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:14.880
There isn't a single being in the universe...

897
01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:17.000
who knows you better than I do.

898
01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:20.400
It's me who brought all of your
troubles upon you.

899
01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:23.680
Falling objects.
The ground splitting beneath your feet.

900
01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:25.720
I was the one who placed
a box of lizards by your bed

901
01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:27.520
and ever since you've feared them.

902
01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:33.120
Your pure and frightened eyes

903
01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:36.360
watch me in my dreams almost
every night.

904
01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:44.280
My name is Valaya.

905
01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:49.560
I had always feared that you wouldn't like
the real me when you saw me.

906
01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:54.840
You like what you see?

907
01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:01.880
It's because of you I went against
my father for the first time.

908
01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:07.320
If only you had destroyed
that stadium...

909
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.320
...in the perfect world my father
will create...

910
01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:15.920
...we could have been...

911
01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:18.120
together...

912
01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:20.160
forever.

913
01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:25.760
But instead...

914
01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:29.360
You failed me.

915
01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:12.160
Finally!

916
01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.040
Knock–knock!

917
01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:29.400
Say hello to... your master!
Hahaha!

918
01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:38.320
This is... part of Cherno's lab.

919
01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:44.480
Anton. are you OK?

920
01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:48.440
My boy...

921
01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:51.240
Tell me...

922
01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:52.840
you didn't poison the stadium...

923
01:15:58.440 --> 01:15:59.480
I was me.

924
01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:08.800
Belo!

925
01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:14.200
Belo!

926
01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:16.440
My creator.

927
01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:19.520
I'll give you a chance to save yourself.

928
01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.280
Come. join me.

929
01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:32.000
He said that you were his creator.

930
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.480
He must have somehow teleported!

931
01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:38.600
Everyone get ready!

932
01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:52.000
He saved your life.

933
01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:22.960
It jumps just like Anton.

934
01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:32.040
Cherno...

935
01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:54.880
Father.

936
01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:57.120
Watch and learn.

937
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:04.800
Fly!

938
01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:14.600
Everybody gather around.

939
01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:23.400
The Galactic Council
needs to be informed.

940
01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:25.320
And you...

941
01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.680
You need to spread yourselves
around the city.

942
01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:30.480
The Wave Eaters will be here soon.

943
01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:35.120
That's all.

944
01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:16.840
People of Earth.

945
01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:19.720
This is Belo.

946
01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:23.720
It's time...
you learn the truth about Cosmoball.

947
01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:26.640
It is not a game
But...a war.

948
01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:29.560
A war that you didn't ask for...

949
01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:32.080
but one that has found you anyway.

950
01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:34.160
I built my stadium ship
for one purpose..

951
01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:38.800
...to prevent the destruction of your planet.

952
01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:43.200
Quitter! Quitter! Quitter! Lalala!

953
01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:45.560
An evil being escaped
from captivity today.

954
01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:48.960
that can destroy the entire universe.

955
01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:53.840
All these years I have tried
to protect you from him...

956
01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:57.360
But I have failed.
Please forgive me.

957
01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.360
Today. like 20 years ago.

958
01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:02.080
the skies will rain fire.

959
01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:04.240
and destruction will come to Earth.

960
01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:06.720
But I have not given up hope.

961
01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:09.320
I will do all I can to save this planet
and its people.

962
01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:13.440
Even though a regular human has no defense
against the power of a Wave Eater.

963
01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:15.720
The Athletes are here to protect you.

964
01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:18.600
And they need your help too.

965
01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:23.400
Together we will fight back
this menace.

966
01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:27.880
Because life is worth fighting for...

967
01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:31.200
fighting for those you love.

968
01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.040
Tell me if it hurts

969
01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:48.600
You don't have to say anything...
I deserve that.

970
01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:00.760
Anton!

971
01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:02.840
They're leaving!

972
01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:20.360
Mom... I really messed up.

973
01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:22.440
Why did I...

974
01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:25.680
Don't worry. Anton.

975
01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:28.960
I don't know
how it is on other planets...

976
01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:32.880
But I know that on Earth.
people make mistakes.

977
01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:36.360
They make them all the time.

978
01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:42.680
But the strong people are those that
try to fix the mistakes they've made.

979
01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:50.480
I'm going to make something
for dinner.

980
01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:02.040
His ship can absorb the energy
of anything we fire at it.

981
01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:04.640
Our only hope is to set up a trap.

982
01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:06.280
Tell me why
he called you his creator?

983
01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:09.880
I thought I told you to stay on Earth.

984
01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:13.640
I'm with you.

985
01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:16.880
With me or away from him?

986
01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:19.960
Doesn't really matter now. does it?

987
01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:24.000
You didn't answer.

988
01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:31.680
Why did he say that
you were his creator?

989
01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:35.920
You taught us to trust each other

990
01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:42.200
My greatest failure...

991
01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:45.680
Forged in my image.

992
01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:49.440
I thought he would assist me
like your Sputniks do.

993
01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:52.000
But I made a mistake...

994
01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:56.320
Gave him feelings.

995
01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:59.240
I failed helping shape those feelings.

996
01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:01.280
Failed at being
his creator and father.

997
01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:06.720
I avoided him and he began
to learn on his own.

998
01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:11.160
The things that he studied were unsafe.
So. I banished him.

999
01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:12.640
That is why he escaped.

1000
01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:15.560
And we know what happened...

1001
01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:17.400
I failed to kill him...

1002
01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:32.280
My creations...

1003
01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:37.120
Only the athletes can stop us now.

1004
01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:41.320
Keep them on the Earth
as long as you can!

1005
01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:10.600
Save me your pie

1006
01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:18.280
Alright girls. We can't let them
reach the city!

1007
01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:20.240
Moscow relies on us

1008
01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:26.320
Boo at two o'clock.

1009
01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:31.480
Stan at five!
Everything gonna be fine!

1010
01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:32.840
– Fan at three
– Yu at twelve

1011
01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:34.640
– Vo at nine o'clock
– Pele at six.

1012
01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:36.520
Keep the circle!

1013
01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:41.920
Earthlings. the most dangerous
is two wave eaters...

1014
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.240
coming at you in a line.

1015
01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:45.320
Be careful!

1016
01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:46.680
It's OK! We'll get through!

1017
01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:51.040
Salvo!

1018
01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:52.600
Salvo!

1019
01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:55.120
Salvo!

1020
01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:55.840
Salvo!

1021
01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:57.400
Fan. get ready!
It's coming to you!

1022
01:24:57.480 --> 01:24:58.520
Got away to position twelve.

1023
01:24:58.600 --> 01:24:59.600
Working on it!

1024
01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:00.360
Salvo!

1025
01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:01.120
Fan. hold on!

1026
01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:02.040
Get ready. Vo!

1027
01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:03.520
Oh gosh!

1028
01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:04.840
Salvo!

1029
01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:08.960
Don't overwhelm Fan!

1030
01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:10.840
I'm on it!

1031
01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:39.760
Hmmm... The pathetic ships
of the galactic fleet...

1032
01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:41.880
Hahaha!

1033
01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:47.080
20 years and still no progress!

1034
01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:49.440
Charge primed. commander.

1035
01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:51.120
Then begin!

1036
01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:09.840
What the...

1037
01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:46.440
It's just us now.

1038
01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:58.960
Don't overheat! Don't overheat!
Don't overheat!

1039
01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:00.200
Salvo!

1040
01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:01.560
Salvo!

1041
01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:03.280
Mine. mine. mine!

1042
01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:04.000
Salvo!

1043
01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:05.960
Fan. it's yours!

1044
01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:08.480
Missed it!

1045
01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:10.880
Salvo!

1046
01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:13.320
Ahh!... Ahh!

1047
01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:15.080
Fan got hit by a wave!

1048
01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:21.240
Fan. hold on!

1049
01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:23.160
How are you feeling?

1050
01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:25.280
Fan. answer me!

1051
01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:26.560
Are you wounded?

1052
01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:27.920
Are you contused?

1053
01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:30.360
Fan. please. tell me something!

1054
01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:36.320
I'm okay.

1055
01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:39.440
Working on position one!

1056
01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:40.080
Mine!

1057
01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:42.720
Salvo!

1058
01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:57.880
Don't leave home without a snack!

1059
01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:16.680
Please wait for me.
I will be back soon.

1060
01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:19.160
I got to fix something...

1061
01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:20.720
Please don't give up.

1062
01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:29.000
'We be of one blood ye and I.'

1063
01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:34.000
That was Mowgli.

1064
01:28:57.760 --> 01:28:58.920
He saved your life.

1065
01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:00.920
It isn't scary to hug.

1066
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:03.600
I told you that I liked you.

1067
01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:28.200
Mowgli.

1068
01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:30.000
Anton.

1069
01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:48.400
Help me!

1070
01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:58.000
It's not scary to hug!

1071
01:29:58.600 --> 01:29:59.920
Remember that...
for the future.

1072
01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:14.560
What are you doing?

1073
01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:19.200
I'm covering your back. Pele!

1074
01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:26.240
Protect Fan!

1075
01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:44.040
Forget it!

1076
01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:49.120
Forget it. It's war!

1077
01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:51.040
I like you!

1078
01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:54.040
All we have is now.

1079
01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:56.960
You don't have to say anything!

1080
01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:57.920
Wait for me!

1081
01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:01.600
I like you too.

1082
01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:03.200
A lot.

1083
01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:07.160
I want to... protect you.

1084
01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:10.040
Come on. We have to go!

1085
01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:17.240
I'm fine. Anton.

1086
01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:19.320
I can still fight.

1087
01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:21.440
You did a great job.

1088
01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:25.200
I'll take your place now. Rest.

1089
01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:28.800
Are we going to win?

1090
01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:31.440
– Of course.
– I'm glad you're back.

1091
01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:32.440
Me too.

1092
01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:43.800
Hold this... Let's go!

1093
01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:45.600
This way!

1094
01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:53.880
Come on!

1095
01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:02.640
We'll wait here!

1096
01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:04.440
We'll be safe!

1097
01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:12.520
Keep moving! Nobody stop! Let's go!

1098
01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:14.920
Officer please look after her!

1099
01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:16.920
She needs rest and water.

1100
01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:17.800
Got it?

1101
01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:19.360
Can I... Get an autograph?

1102
01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:20.440
Later.

1103
01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:21.680
– Stay strong.
– Anton...

1104
01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:29.680
Natasha! Natasha!

1105
01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:31.120
Two Wave Eaters in a row.

1106
01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:33.000
Watch out. guys. Watch out!

1107
01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:33.960
Two of them...

1108
01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:36.680
Anton! Fan! Watch out!
They're coming your way!

1109
01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:40.160
Wait! Wait!
He can't hear without his helmet!

1110
01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:42.600
Attention everyone!
Two Wave Eaters in a row!

1111
01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:49.200
Salvo!

1112
01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:03.520
Look! A Sputnik!

1113
01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:05.160
Where is it going?

1114
01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:24.560
Mowgli!

1115
01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:00.800
Take this.

1116
01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:07.400
The ship will now
obey your every command.

1117
01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:09.320
If I don't make it back alive.

1118
01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:12.400
go back to Earth and save
everyone you can.

1119
01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:18.280
But you can leave him if you want.

1120
01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:31.920
Guys. Natasha! I am
not a traitor!

1121
01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:34.080
I wanted to say sorry.
I was an idiot!

1122
01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:37.000
Natasha just went after Cherno!
Get back into position!

1123
01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:39.960
Combat mode!

1124
01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:41.840
Mowgli!

1125
01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:44.920
Let's try this again.

1126
01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:03.880
You discharged
a Wave Eater with one hit!

1127
01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:05.960
You okay man?

1128
01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:09.160
I'm not really sure yet.
Watch me!

1129
01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.640
How are you doing that?

1130
01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:24.160
I have no idea.

1131
01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:27.120
But I'm gonna kick their butts
for as long as I can!

1132
01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:38.920
You're doing a great job. little chickie.

1133
01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:46.400
You should never teleport
beyond your line of sight.

1134
01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:48.920
Belo?

1135
01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:54.720
If he dies...

1136
01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:56.320
...The whole thing explodes.

1137
01:35:56.760 --> 01:35:58.240
Please. get back in time.

1138
01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:00.040
Earthlings need their captain!

1139
01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:03.920
You still cower from the thing
you've created.

1140
01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:06.840
I didn't force you to do this.

1141
01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:10.600
I've forgotten what you look like.

1142
01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:17.240
Helmet.

1143
01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.760
Ahhh... Now there you are.

1144
01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:35.480
You are the only one–

1145
01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:38.440
–who can truly appreciate
the inventions I've created.

1146
01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:43.520
Which will replace all
that exists in this universe.

1147
01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:46.240
But first ... you will show me

1148
01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:48.080
what you have done
in all these years.

1149
01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:53.640
Don't tell me you've wasted your time
with hatred of me.

1150
01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:57.080
If saving the universe
from a madman who wants

1151
01:36:57.160 --> 01:36:59.160
to destroy it is a waste of time
in your mind...

1152
01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:00.600
...then yes.

1153
01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:06.440
Twenty years...

1154
01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:09.760
I've waited for this moment.

1155
01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:14.040
Twenty years!

1156
01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:21.360
I had thought we could have a chat...

1157
01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:23.640
longer!

1158
01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:31.040
Get her!

1159
01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:34.480
You have forgotten. Belo!

1160
01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:38.720
You created me much stronger
that yourself!

1161
01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:42.560
That is how you die today!

1162
01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:54.480
She said I couldn't.

1163
01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:02.000
Natasha!

1164
01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:12.840
It wouldn't have worked...you and him...

1165
01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:46.320
No!

1166
01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:50.760
Noooo!

1167
01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:54.600
You could never match my genius!

1168
01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:29.520
Everybody. Make some space.

1169
01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:32.160
Save some water! Breathe rarely!

1170
01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:32.960
Now...

1171
01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:35.160
Children protect us.

1172
01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:36.880
Come on. Let's go.

1173
01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:37.720
Is she alive?

1174
01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:39.240
We have to fight!

1175
01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:47.680
Fight.

1176
01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:50.560
For those we love.

1177
01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.160
Grab a weapon! Come with me!

1178
01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:19.880
Come

1179
01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:30.840
Do you know what I've dreamt
of all these years?

1180
01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.640
That I'd finally face you
and say

1181
01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:36.720
"Father.

1182
01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:39.560
Farewell."

1183
01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.520
You think you're capable...
Of killing her?

1184
01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:07.040
My dear child.

1185
01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:10.480
She has never been a perfect creation.

1186
01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:26.520
You can not teleport
until I order to let you go!

1187
01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:33.320
Your powers belong to me!

1188
01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:37.120
And I will take them back from you!

1189
01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:42.040
Now's your chance.

1190
01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:53.080
The ship is made of your cells.
Talk to it!

1191
01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:45.480
Roaring! Biting! Killing!

1192
01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:47.800
Is that your life philosophy?

1193
01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:10.720
We are of the same blood...

1194
01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:12.000
Listen to me!

1195
01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:23.400
You're just a little kid...

1196
01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:51.280
Hey kid.

1197
01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:02.880
Don't cry.

1198
01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:06.560
We need your help.

1199
01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:10.600
Earthling...

1200
01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:13.480
No way...

1201
01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:23.440
What's happening?

1202
01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:54.040
No!

1203
01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:55.160
Don't you dare!

1204
01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:56.240
I am your master!

1205
01:44:56.600 --> 01:44:57.880
I created you!

1206
01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:01.480
No. No! No!

1207
01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:08.680
Hey!

1208
01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:28.520
Hey!

1209
01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:35.600
Helmet...

1210
01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:39.360
Hey!

1211
01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:42.880
Captain. it was an honor
to serve with you!

1212
01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:44.080
We need to go.

1213
01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:48.520
It's time to show them
what we're made of!

1214
01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:13.720
See that?

1215
01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:16.520
It's a fireball. captain.

1216
01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:19.600
It looks like victory!

1217
01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:24.800
And that's how we do it
in the Police!

1218
01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:45.360
The danger has passed.

1219
01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:48.120
And harnessing the energy of the remaining
Wave Eaters will enable us

1220
01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:49.960
to restore life on Earth

1221
01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:52.200
and resuscitate our environment.

1222
01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:56.280
It's time to live. not just survive.

1223
01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:06.720
Natasha!

1224
01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:23.440
Looks similar...

1225
01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:34.160
See! The Moon is amazing!

1226
01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:37.880
We have survived the harshest
20 years of human history.

1227
01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:41.120
And we know now that it is together
with our courage and ability

1228
01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:44.960
to never give up hope

1229
01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:46.680
To prove it...

1230
01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:49.440
Belo sacrificed his life for us.

1231
01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:53.120
For us and for our planet

1232
01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:57.840
Time to work.
no staring at the sky!

1233
01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:00.880
And the invasion
of the red dogs is really

1234
01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:02.520
similar to the attacks
of the Wave Eaters...

1235
01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:03.240
Guys!

1236
01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:05.560
Be careful. The microphone
could have still been on.

1237
01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:06.560
...Kipling predicted everything.

1238
01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:08.680
I'll put it here.

1239
01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:13.960
Look. Visitors.

1240
01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:22.240
Here to arrest me?

1241
01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:25.080
No. no.

1242
01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:28.480
The Police are dropping
all charges against you

1243
01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:30.320
for your services
in saving the Planet.

1244
01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:34.880
We forgive you for robbing the drugstore.

1245
01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:36.400
I'm here to...

1246
01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:38.840
Ah... yeah..

1247
01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:42.200
Well. you know... I want to...

1248
01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:44.240
...marry

1249
01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:45.040
Vasya.

1250
01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:47.080
Basically. Anton...

1251
01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:49.560
if you don't want to call me "dad"

1252
01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:50.480
I understand

1253
01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:54.200
OK... Captain...

1254
01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:55.240
Congratulations!

1255
01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:56.000
So you two...

1256
01:48:56.720 --> 01:48:57.680
Great!

1257
01:48:57.760 --> 01:48:58.880
These are my friends!

1258
01:48:59.120 --> 01:48:59.760
This is Pele

1259
01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:01.560
This is Fan
and this is...

1260
01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:04.280
That's Mowgli.

1261
01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:05.320
And where is kid?

1262
01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:07.080
Kid? Kid?

1263
01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:09.360
Holy cow!

1264
01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:10.600
Vasya!

1265
01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.280
And of course there is...

1266
01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:18.600
Natasha.

1267
01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:20.680
She is the girl that I...

1268
01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:23.760
The girl that you love.

1269
01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:29.040
Teleported!

1270
01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:35.120
I have such a big family now!

1271
01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:39.120
I'm sorry for calling you names before.

1272
01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:41.480
Ah. that's OK. son.
