you won't eat.

552
01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:32.920
You don't want me to touch you.

553
01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:37.120
Do I turn you off or what?

554
01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:40.000
I'm not hungry.

555
01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:46.600
Do you want to leave?

556
01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:49.600
I dunno.

557
01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:51.400
"I dunno".

558
01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:54.080
You never know.

559
01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:56.680
Make a fucking effort.

560
01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:01.400
- You take and never give.
- Stop it.

561
01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:13.320
Tell me what's wrong.

562
01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:15.920
I don't know.

563
01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:41.440
Hello?

564
01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:43.120
Oh yes. hello.

565
01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:45.600
Here he is.
It's your sister.

566
01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:48.480
Camille?

567
01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:50.760
You alright?

568
01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:56.040
When?

569
01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:02.920
No I can't.

570
01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:07.400
Please don't insist. Bye.

571
01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:15.120
So?

572
01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:18.240
My father is dead.

573
01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:29.600
When did it happen?

574
01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:32.440
She didn't say.

575
01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:36.760
During the night. I guess.

576
01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:42.400
How old was he?

577
01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:45.440
60 something.

578
01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:57.480
You should have come.

579
01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:00.240
I hate funerals.

580
01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:06.800
Yeah. you're right.
It was a drag... too hot out.

581
01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:10.760
It's nicer in bed with Martial.

582
01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:13.840
What's your point?

583
01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:15.440
Nothing at all!

584
01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:19.160
I get it. Paul!
Dad couldn't stand you.

585
01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:20.760
He thought you were a jerk.

586
01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:26.080
Why spend a boring day
with your bourgeois family?

587
01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:29.920
After all. they hate gays!

588
01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:33.080
Speaking of which...

589
01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:34.800
Your guy's a good lay. huh?

590
01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:37.240
You wear me out. Camille.

591
01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:39.720
- What's your deal?
- What deal?

592
01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:42.880
Everything's fine over here.
No problems. got that?

593
01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:45.040
You're the one with the problem.

594
01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:47.040
Look at you.

595
01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:50.240
For 10 years you've sulked like
a misunderstood martyr.

596
01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:52.840
Give it a rest for once.

597
01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:55.040
Come on. talk to me!

598
01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:56.440
There's nothing to say.

599
01:40:56.840 --> 01:40:57.800
You're delirious.

600
01:40:58.600 --> 01:40:59.960
Right. I'm delirious!

601
01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:05.880
Am I the nutcase who photographed
my naked father on his deathbed?

602
01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:15.520
I know you won't talk to me.
and you don't want to listen.

603
01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:17.720
But let me tell you...

604
01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:20.240
you're not the only one
who's suffering.

605
01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:24.120
It was hard for me. too.

606
01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:32.440
Working with him was good.
I was happy. but sometimes...

607
01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:34.760
it was suffocating.

608
01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:38.440
I thought about you.

609
01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:44.040
I admired you breaking ties.
creating your own life...

610
01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:45.480
being free.

611
01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:50.320
You're happy with Martial.
I can see it.

612
01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:51.520
He loves you.

613
01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:54.840
As for my love life...

614
01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:57.680
It's just one big fiasco.

615
01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:02.000
Pretty dumb. huh?

616
01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:08.880
I always wished
I could talk to you about it.

617
01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:14.240
Why am I telling you all this?
You couldn't care less.

618
01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:16.760
No.

619
01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:32.440
You know. Dad woke up
while you were taking pictures.

620
01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:33.840
Oh yeah?

621
01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:38.000
You didn't notice?

622
01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:41.080
No.

623
01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:46.600
Anyway. it made him happy.

624
01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:51.320
You were finally
photographing your family.

625
01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:02.160
I know you want nothing from him.

626
01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:09.160
But he wanted me to give you these.

627
01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:13.680
They're his favorite photos.

628
01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:17.560
I've never seen them.

629
01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:20.640
He took them on his travels.
