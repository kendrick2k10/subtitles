(light music)

6
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.687
- [Cameron] Dad. can I come up
and look for a treasure map?

7
00:02:12.687 --> 00:02:14.950
- It's not like "The Goonies" up here.

8
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.074
It's pretty tight.

9
00:02:16.074 --> 00:02:18.185
- [Cameron] But I've never been up there.

10
00:02:18.185 --> 00:02:20.185
- All right. come on up.

11
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.953
- Whoa!

12
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.367
This is exactly like "The Goonies."

13
00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:33.546
Whoa. are those CDs?

14
00:02:33.546 --> 00:02:34.896
- Nah. they're video tapes.

15
00:02:36.166 --> 00:02:38.499
- Whoa. is that a scrapbook?

16
00:02:39.366 --> 00:02:41.477
- Yeah. careful with it.

17
00:02:41.477 --> 00:02:42.758
Careful. it's old.

18
00:02:42.758 --> 00:02:43.690
- Sorry.

19
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.820
- Yeah. we didn't have a lot
of money when I was a kid.

20
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.930
But I got to go to one game and I made

21
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.110
a whole scrap book out of it.

22
00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.570
- [Cameron] What year was it?

23
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.675
- May 15th. 1993.

24
00:02:54.675 --> 00:02:57.175
(light music)

25
00:03:19.382 --> 00:03:22.700
But check this out. I
was able to sneak down

26
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.390
and take that picture.

27
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.223
And I blew it up.

28
00:03:25.223 --> 00:03:27.531
It's right there. see.

29
00:03:27.531 --> 00:03:29.002
- [Cameron] Well. why?

30
00:03:29.002 --> 00:03:29.930
- Because it looks amazing.

31
00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.820
I took that. that's Michael Jordan.

32
00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.910
- Whoa. I didn't catch that.

33
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.161
- Yeah. I was able to
sneak down and get that.

34
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:38.187
And then see that picture?

35
00:03:38.187 --> 00:03:39.190
- [Cameron] Uh-huh.

36
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.139
- [Adam] That picture was--

37
00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:43.030
- Wait. that looks like
the guy from the movie.

38
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.220
Monster Lulu's Trampalator.

39
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.662
- Oh. Luther The Anger Translator.

40
00:03:48.662 --> 00:03:49.495
- Yeah.

41
00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:50.328
- Yeah.

42
00:03:50.328 --> 00:03:52.683
Yeah. you're not supposed
to have seen that but okay.

43
00:03:53.652 --> 00:03:55.069
But look at this.

44
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.693
See. I blew it up.

45
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.840
I guess Michael Jordan
did look like Luther

46
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.800
the Anger Translator.

47
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.350
I never thought about that.

48
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.520
- Yeah. why do you have a towel?

49
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.540
- Ah. that's very special.

50
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.792
This is Michael Jordan's towel.

51
00:04:11.792 --> 00:04:13.207
- Why do you have it?

52
00:04:13.207 --> 00:04:14.800
- Um. I was in the locker room

53
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.633
and he left it.

54
00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.013
And I took it.

55
00:04:19.013 --> 00:04:19.973
- Why'd you take it?

56
00:04:19.973 --> 00:04:21.429
- Because it's Michael Jordan's.

57
00:04:21.429 --> 00:04:22.494
It's like 25 years old.

58
00:04:22.494 --> 00:04:23.860
Just. okay. it's a little weird.

59
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.502
I admit.

60
00:04:25.502 --> 00:04:26.857
- How'd you get into the locker room?

61
00:04:26.857 --> 00:04:28.070
Are these CDs?

62
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.520
- No. these are video tapes

63
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.210
and I was in radio and I got a press pass.

64
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.505
And these are the video
I took when I met Jordan.

65
00:04:38.505 --> 00:04:39.657
- You met Jordan?

66
00:04:39.657 --> 00:04:40.910
- Yeah.
- Can we watch 'em?

67
00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.410
- Uh. yeah.

68
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:43.860
I guess it should still work.

69
00:04:44.775 --> 00:04:47.275
(light music)

70
00:04:55.298 --> 00:04:57.631
(murmuring)

71
00:05:00.738 --> 00:05:01.837
- [Michael] The closest to being

72
00:05:01.837 --> 00:05:04.100
a post up center have to be--

73
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.413
- Why is this so shaky?

74
00:05:06.413 --> 00:05:08.000
- I was nervous.

75
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.680
That's Michael Jordan.

76
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.980
I had never used this camera before. man.

77
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.980
I bought it that morning.

78
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.666
So I didn't know how any
of this stuff worked.

79
00:05:17.666 --> 00:05:18.499
- No idea?

80
00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:19.700
- I just bought it that morning.

81
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.450
Before there's me and that reporter.

82
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:24.830
and that other guy was Quinn Buckner.

83
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:25.663
We were just hanging out talking

84
00:05:25.663 --> 00:05:27.040
like it was totally normal.

85
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.540
But I couldn't record that.

86
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.510
I actually shouldn't even
been really recording this

87
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.080
but I did.

88
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.960
Oh wait. you should hear this.

89
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.513
Jordan's talking about Shaq.

90
00:05:37.442 --> 00:05:39.594
- The hot chip guy?

91
00:05:39.594 --> 00:05:41.594
- Yes. the hot chip guy.

92
00:05:43.082 --> 00:05:43.915
- [Michael] The closest to being

93
00:05:43.915 --> 00:05:46.413
a post-up center is Patrick Ewing.

94
00:05:47.853 --> 00:05:49.410
Then Alonzo Mourning
and Alonzo. he can stand

95
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.855
at the 3-point range shooting threes. so.

96
00:05:52.855 --> 00:05:54.240
And Shaq.

97
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.037
Shaq and Patrick are these ones.

98
00:05:56.037 --> 00:05:59.165
these centers that really remain dominant

99
00:05:59.165 --> 00:06:01.582
in the center. in the middle.

100
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.020
- Sure. and that's gonna work

101
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.277
because Scott. Anderson. Hardaway--

102
00:06:08.277 --> 00:06:11.340
- Hardaway. all those guys
that you can just move around.

103
00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.713
Different pieces of
the puzzle with Horace.

104
00:06:15.056 --> 00:06:17.362
- [Reporter] Are we good?

105
00:06:17.362 --> 00:06:18.862
- It's gonna work.

106
00:06:19.846 --> 00:06:22.002
- Why'd the color go away?

107
00:06:22.002 --> 00:06:24.083
- Uh. it was a setting on a camera.

108
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.250
And just turn it like this

109
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.330
and it could do black and white.

110
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.940
I thought black and
white looked kinda cool.

111
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.294
I did some color stuff too.

112
00:06:32.294 --> 00:06:33.447
- I know you've been asked this before.

113
00:06:33.447 --> 00:06:36.541
As far as next year and
the balloon agreement

114
00:06:36.541 --> 00:06:38.162
and all of that. it's gonna be

115
00:06:38.162 --> 00:06:39.751
an incredible free agent market.

116
00:06:39.751 --> 00:06:41.042
- Sure.

117
00:06:41.042 --> 00:06:44.667
- [Reporter] Can you envision
playing anywhere else?

118
00:06:44.667 --> 00:06:47.239
I mean. obviously they
can offer you. how many...

119
00:06:47.239 --> 00:06:48.091
- No. I don't envision.

120
00:06:48.091 --> 00:06:50.173
I don't really have.

121
00:06:50.173 --> 00:06:52.093
I don't wanna play anywhere else.

122
00:06:52.093 --> 00:06:57.093
I want to play in Chicago.

123
00:06:57.563 --> 00:07:02.130
Will they step forward
and see that I do that?

124
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.423
I don't have any reason to
think that they wouldn't.

125
00:07:05.423 --> 00:07:07.506
You know. quite honestly.

126
00:07:09.781 --> 00:07:11.781
But you never say never.

127
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.447
- They talk about the Lakers here.

128
00:07:19.447 --> 00:07:21.447
- The original Game Boy!

129
00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.256
- [Reporter] There's gonna be
like. eight teams next year

130
00:07:26.256 --> 00:07:28.197
that have between seven
and eight. you know.

131
00:07:28.197 --> 00:07:30.400
at least seven million to sign.

132
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.233
- [Michael] If Shaq signs first.

133
00:07:31.233 --> 00:07:33.730
seven and eight million.
it's not gonna be enough.

134
00:07:35.362 --> 00:07:38.816
You know. it's gonna be one
guy that sets the market.

135
00:07:38.816 --> 00:07:40.778
- [Reporter] The Lakers are gonna have.

136
00:07:40.778 --> 00:07:42.230
if they renounce Elden. which they'll do.

137
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:44.160
so they'll have another slot.

138
00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:44.993
They'll have 9.3.

139
00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:47.123
- So will Miami.

140
00:07:47.123 --> 00:07:47.956
- [Reporter] That's just guys comin' out.

141
00:07:47.956 --> 00:07:49.310
- Miami's right there too.

142
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.316
- [Reporter] Yeah.

143
00:07:50.316 --> 00:07:51.330
- Miami's right at 10.

144
00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:52.180
- [Reporter] Yep.

145
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.424
- Right at 10 in free agency.

146
00:07:55.424 --> 00:07:56.560
- [Vienna] Dad. can I come up?

147
00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.393
- Yeah.

148
00:07:58.650 --> 00:07:59.483
Hey Cam. look.

149
00:07:59.483 --> 00:08:01.220
Pippen likes Gatorade too.

150
00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:02.083
- Who's Pippen?

151
00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:05.803
- I have failed you.

152
00:08:07.338 --> 00:08:09.671
(murmuring)

153
00:08:14.164 --> 00:08:14.997
- Wow.

154
00:08:16.655 --> 00:08:19.155
(light music)

155
00:08:20.557 --> 00:08:22.560
Are these basketball cards?

156
00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.244
- Yeah. I bought every
single basketball card

157
00:08:26.244 --> 00:08:27.844
I could afford when I was a kid.

158
00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:30.276
Pretty. right?

159
00:08:30.276 --> 00:08:31.476
- Yeah.

160
00:08:31.476 --> 00:08:34.059
(light music)

161
00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:38.550
- [Adam] When you don't
live in an NBA city

162
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:39.990
you gravitate towards anything

163
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:42.582
that can make you feel like you're there.

164
00:08:42.582 --> 00:08:43.870
And when you're from Columbus. Ohio

165
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.800
there are Buckeye fans
and only Buckeye fans.

166
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.000
'Cause we all just felt
sorry for Cleveland.

167
00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:54.950
So I adopted the Chicago
Bulls when I was nine

168
00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:56.940
simply because the Chicago Bears won

169
00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.710
the Superbowl that year.

170
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:01.070
Which means I lucked into following Jordan

171
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:02.793
right as he began to explode.

172
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:06.350
I was also lucky enough to be taping

173
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:09.100
the night Jordan scored
69 and my father and I

174
00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.680
edited a highlight reel using two VCRs

175
00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.423
and ended up doing that for
every game I could tape.

176
00:09:15.508 --> 00:09:18.008
(light music)

177
00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:20.790
And magazines.

178
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:23.550
My goodness. the magazines covers.

179
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:25.280
I read them. cut out some pictures.

180
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.930
and I'd get an extra copy to save

181
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:28.723
like giant basketball cards.

182
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.130
We tend to forget that
before HD broadcasts

183
00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:35.760
and TVs the size of your wall. these types

184
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.220
of images were like gold.

185
00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.670
You'd see magazine spreads
on a game you had watched

186
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:42.680
and think. wow. that's
what it would be like

187
00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.160
if I was ever able to sit that close.

188
00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.030
Knowing you surely would
never get that access.

189
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:52.253
But for a few moments looking
through those pages. you did.

190
00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:57.010
And then when Jordan retired
I was absolutely crushed.

191
00:09:57.010 --> 00:10:00.473
Which made what came next
even more spectacular.

192
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:02.533
The return.

193
00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:05.780
Because now I was an adult.

194
00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.100
I was out of the house.

195
00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.130
So if I wanted to spend 300 dollars

196
00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:11.360
for a pair of nose bleeds
to see Jordan's return

197
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.613
to Cleveland in April of
'95. no one could stop me.

198
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.153
And of course. it added to my scrap book.

199
00:10:19.185 --> 00:10:21.685
(light music)

200
00:10:32.776 --> 00:10:35.210
And then two months later
my life changed forever

201
00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.120
when I became the youngest talk show host

202
00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.080
ever hired at 610 WTVN.

by a radio show host who can't get off

219
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.470
the graveyard shift
'cause he only knows about

220
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.385
the Beatles and Michael Jordan?

221
00:11:20.385 --> 00:11:21.553
- You know how old I am. buddy?

222
00:11:22.755 --> 00:11:24.387
What were you doing at 19?

223
00:11:24.387 --> 00:11:25.720
- [Adam Voiceover] And of
course any chance I got.

224
00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.950
I talked about Jordan.

225
00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:30.440
- Dislocated his index finger in the game.

226
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.710
Scared the crap outta me.
I was laying on the ground.

227
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:33.750
Like. oh god. he's hurt.

228
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:35.200
He's gone. He's done.

229
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.070
Because Michael was rolling
on the floor in tears. man.

230
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:42.830
He was. he looked pretty. pretty hurt.

231
00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:45.470
Then he comes back and scores
16 in the second quarter

232
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.910
and he's okay.

233
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:49.030
- [Adam Voiceover] I
talked about him so much

234
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:51.040
someone finally called and said. you know.

235
00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.780
you work at a radio station.

236
00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.620
Just ask for a press pass.

237
00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.260
So I did.

238
00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:57.463
And they gave me one!

239
00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:01.053
They gave a teenager a license to dream.

240
00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:04.440
And suddenly this dude's leg would be

241
00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.913
where I would end up
watching an entire game.

242
00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:09.650
I pulled out my childhood camera

243
00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:12.603
and it was like my basketball
cards came to life.

244
00:12:13.881 --> 00:12:16.381
(light music)

245
00:12:40.417 --> 00:12:41.980
And then I remembered I had just bought

246
00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:45.003

You can't be there.

You're gonna have to move off to the side.

You're gonna have to go off to the side.

256

supposed to be. right?

257
00:13:11.165 --> 00:13:13.509
- [Man] You're gonna have
to go off to the side.

258
00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:15.974
We've got a lot of guys
that work in the front.

259
00:13:15.974 --> 00:13:18.420
- Is he yelling at you?

260
00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.390
- No. but that was when
I realized radio guys

261
00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:22.790
aren't supposed to sit on the court.

262
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:26.573
And I just tried to hide.

263
00:13:27.468 --> 00:13:30.218
(crowd cheering)

264
00:13:47.423 --> 00:13:49.792
- [Phil] Go through!

265
00:13:49.792 --> 00:13:51.400
Go through.

266
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.050
- So how did you take this. then?

267
00:13:56.085 --> 00:13:59.883
- Basically. I put it in my lap like this.

268
00:14:02.255 --> 00:14:03.230
And it was not fun.

269
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.740
But I figured if I just kept my head down.

270
00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:06.740
nobody would notice.

271
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:08.583
I got lucky.

272
00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:12.310
You can actually see me in
the broadcast of the game.

273
00:14:13.418 --> 00:14:16.092
(whistle blowing)

274
00:14:16.092 --> 00:14:19.539

281
00:15:04.477 --> 00:15:06.834
Out of bounds. Chicago ball.

282
00:15:06.834 --> 00:15:08.563
- [Bench] All right. all
right one. three high.

283
00:15:08.563 --> 00:15:10.850
When I tell you man. you gotta listen.

284
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:12.840
- [Adam] As I got settled
into the game I realized.

285
00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.480
I couldn't keep following the ball

286
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.730
or the footage was gonna be awful.

287
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:18.380
But it was so loud and the players

288
00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:21.710
were so close. I was actually scared.

289
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:24.230
It's something you don't
feel when you're in the seats

290
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:26.123
and most definitely not on TV.

291

Oh. and let me shout out
John Paxson real quick.

362
00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:38.330
When I got my press pass
and I saw Jordan enter

363
00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:40.730
the locker room. I immediately went in.

364
00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:43.240
Which was apparently the
incorrect thing to do

365
00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.730
and Jerry Krause lost his mind at me

366
00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:47.870
and screamed for me to get out.

367
00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:49.820
Now. a part of me was
honored because he was

368
00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.770
an infamous jerk that
every Bulls fan hated.

369
00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:54.810
But while grabbing some
food Paxson came up

370
00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:58.310
to me and profusely apologized
for his general manager.

371
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:59.820
He was genuinely embarrassed

372
00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:01.880
and signed an autograph for me.

373
00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.680
The man who sealed the 3-peat in '93.

374
00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.330
So cool.

375
00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.030
But yes. the coaches were nonstop.

376
00:20:08.865 --> 00:20:11.588
- Play the ball. play the ball!

377
00:20:11.588 --> 00:20:12.827
- Let's go. guys!

378
00:20:12.827 --> 00:20:13.660
- Pass D!

379
00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:14.743
- Go. go. go!

380
00:20:15.627 --> 00:20:17.410
- [Adam] And the Cavs
coach. Mike Fratello.

381
00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:20.224
he just seemed docile in comparison.

382
00:20:20.224 --> 00:20:22.474
- Offsides. John. offsides.

383
00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.876
- [Phil] That's illegal.

384
00:20:27.876 --> 00:20:29.793
That's illegal defense!

385
00:20:31.642 --> 00:20:34.917
Do you know how to call a charge?

386
00:20:34.917 --> 00:20:37.750
(crowd murmuring)

387
00:20:39.528 --> 00:20:41.445
Move the ball. move it.

388
00:20:44.864 --> 00:20:45.781
Go through!

389
00:20:47.073 --> 00:20:48.406
Go through. Luc.

390
00:20:51.623 --> 00:20:53.873
Carry out. dive. Luc. dive!

391
00:20:55.941 --> 00:20:57.941
(whistle blowing)

392
00:20:57.941 --> 00:20:59.535
Come on!

393
00:20:59.535 --> 00:21:00.921
Luc!

394
00:21:00.921 --> 00:21:04.181
- [Announcer] Offensive foul
on number 13. Luc Longley.

395
00:21:04.181 --> 00:21:05.014
That's his first.

396
00:21:05.014 --> 00:21:07.097
- [Phil] Go through. Luc!

397
00:21:09.549 --> 00:21:10.799
Sync Luc. sync!

398
00:21:11.646 --> 00:21:12.479
God!

399
00:21:14.222 --> 00:21:15.228
Luc!

400
00:21:15.228 --> 00:21:17.100
- He's really mad at Luc.

401
00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.410
- Yeah. Luc gets it the entire game.

402
00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:21.150
But they're making him a better player.

403
00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:22.968
- But they're being mean.

404
00:21:22.968 --> 00:21:23.801
- They're not being mean.

405
00:21:23.801 --> 00:21:25.790
They're just telling him when
he's missing his assignments.

406
00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:27.217
This is a championship team. man.

407
00:21:27.217 --> 00:21:29.170
you can't miss your assignments.

408
00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:32.323
Luc wants the coach to
tell him that. I think.

409
00:21:33.517 --> 00:21:36.350
(crowd murmuring)

410
00:21:40.355 --> 00:21:41.772
- [Phil] Hold it.

411
00:21:42.852 --> 00:21:43.992
- [Coach] Back up. back up!

412
00:21:43.992 --> 00:21:45.342
- [Phil] Dive. dive Luc.

413
00:21:45.342 --> 00:21:46.342
Look at him.

414
00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:49.683
Dive. Luc!

415
00:21:50.788 --> 00:21:52.542
- [Fan] Come on. Mike.

416
00:21:52.542 --> 00:21:53.658
- [Phil] Cut through.

417
00:21:53.658 --> 00:21:56.325
Keep Luc. keep hittin' him. Luc.

418
00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.638
(whistling)

419
00:21:58.638 --> 00:21:59.471
Luc!

420
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:02.107
Hold. hold!

421
00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.863
- [Bench] There we are.

422
00:22:05.863 --> 00:22:08.721
- [Phil] Rebound. get at him!

423
00:22:08.721 --> 00:22:10.138
Are you watchin'?

424
00:22:12.116 --> 00:22:13.306
- [Bench] Right there in the middle!

425
00:22:13.306 --> 00:22:14.569
The middle!

426
00:22:14.569 --> 00:22:16.274
Why you aren't looking' at him. Luc!

427
00:22:16.274 --> 00:22:17.607
- [Phil] Charge.

428
00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.977
- [Bench] Get home. get home.

429
00:22:23.977 --> 00:22:25.362
You see it?

430
00:22:25.362 --> 00:22:26.279
The middle!

431
00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:29.669
- [Phil] You see that. you're too late.

432
00:22:29.669 --> 00:22:30.502
God. Luc!

433
00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:35.200
- [Adam] And then Jordan
came out of the game.

434
00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.810
But the TV didn't cut away

435
00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:39.423
and he basically sat on
the couch next to me.

436
00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.820
In 10 years of watching Bulls
games I never really saw

437
00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.310
how Jordan interacts on the bench

438
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:47.133
or what happens during time outs.

439
00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.860
All that crowd noise started to fade

440
00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:53.063
and the wonder of the moment returned.

441
00:22:54.362 --> 00:22:56.862
(light music)

442
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:35.300
Jordan was all business
but Pippen and Harper

443
00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.881
were having the time of their lives.

444
00:24:37.881 --> 00:24:40.131
(cheering)

445
00:24:44.224 --> 00:24:45.141
- Heads up!

446
00:24:59.262 --> 00:25:01.765
- [Announcer] Cav's ball.

447
00:25:01.765 --> 00:25:05.899
For the Cavaliers number 11 John Crotty.

448
00:25:05.899 --> 00:25:08.732
(crowd murmuring)

449
00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:20.260
- [Adam] Yeah. did you catch that?

450
00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:21.920
Pippen not only looked in the camera

451
00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:24.550
but can also see him thinking. wait.

452
00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:25.980
they're letting kids with camcorders

453
00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:26.853
on the floor now?

454
00:25:28.444 --> 00:25:32.444
- [Coach] Talk it out.
talk it out. talk it out.

455
00:25:35.485 --> 00:25:40.184
- [Bench] Shoot it. Harper!

456
00:25:40.184 --> 00:25:42.434
- [Announcer] Jason Caffey.

457
00:25:43.849 --> 00:25:47.640
- Let's go jerks. let's play some D.

458
00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.640
(funky arena music)

459
00:25:58.305 --> 00:26:00.889
(buzzer)

460
00:26:00.889 --> 00:26:02.299
- [Announcer] Time out. Chicago.

461
00:26:02.299 --> 00:26:03.683
Bulls time out.

462
00:26:03.683 --> 00:26:06.433
(crowd cheering)

463
00:26:12.787 --> 00:26:14.360
Ladies and gentlemen let's see who's here

464
00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.890
on tonight's fan cam.

465
00:26:18.246 --> 00:26:22.585
♪ Time out. come on♪

466
00:26:22.585 --> 00:26:25.085
(funky music)

467
00:26:29.503 --> 00:26:31.586
(buzzer)

468
00:26:39.427 --> 00:26:42.490
(crowd jeering)

469
00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:44.431
- [Phil] MJ. you're right back.

470
00:26:44.431 --> 00:26:47.694
- [Announcer] Offensive foul
on number 13. John Amaechi.

471
00:26:47.694 --> 00:26:48.527
- [Fan] Come on. dog. what's that?

472
00:26:48.527 --> 00:26:50.400
- [Announcer] That's his second.

473
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.830
No team foul.

474
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:53.793
Michael Jordan returns for Chicago.

475
00:26:54.693 --> 00:26:57.443
(crowd cheering)

476
00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:06.530
- [Adam] Then when Jordan came back in.

477
00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:09.853
I instinctively grabbed
my childhood camera again.

478
00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:12.780
It's hilarious to me that I'm in a row

479
00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:14.130
of professional photographers

480
00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:16.600
with tens of thousands
of dollars of equipment

481
00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:20.610
and here I am with a 50
dollar point and click.

482
00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:22.443
But therein lies the magic.

483
00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.353
These pictures look like my memories.

484
00:27:27.715 --> 00:27:30.215
(light music)

485
00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:02.683
- Wait. Jordan's 23.

486
00:29:04.353 --> 00:29:05.186
That's 45.

487
00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:08.967
And that's 33.

488
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.591
- That's Scottie Pippen.
and that is Michael Jordan.

489
00:29:13.591 --> 00:29:15.000
- And they signed them.

490
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:15.833
- Yup.

491
00:29:15.833 --> 00:29:17.333
- Why 45?

492
00:29:17.333 --> 00:29:19.050
- That was his come back number

493
00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:21.570
and it meant the world to me.

494
00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:23.740
So I mentioned I was an
adult when he came back.

495
00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:26.500
But did I mention I was insane?

496
00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:29.310
I taped every single game
of his comeback season

497
00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:31.230
which meant begging local sports bars

498
00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:33.363
to let me record their satellite feeds.

499
00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:37.990
I kept a journal documenting
every single moment.

500
00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:40.630
Mostly for my own therapy since
I lived in Buckeye country

501
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:43.600
and no one was as fanatical
about it as I was.

502
00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:46.320
The reason I was so nuts was
this overwhelming feeling

503
00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.550
that I didn't appreciate his first run

504
00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:51.130
and I wasn't gonna let that happen again.

505
00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:52.870
That's why I went into that locker room

506
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:56.120
with a 45 jersey under my
clothes and risked my job

507
00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.500
to have him sign it.

508
00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:58.930
And he wasn't too happy.

509
00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:00.620
- Was he mad at you?

510
00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:01.647
- Just disappointed.

511
00:30:01.647 --> 00:30:03.040
It was unprofessional.

512
00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.320
I was supposed to be
working and I shouldn't

513
00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.400
have asked for an autograph. but.

514
00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.173
- You coulda lost your job?

515
00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:11.501
- Yeah.

516
00:30:11.501 --> 00:30:13.653
But I'd only had it for a
couple months at that point.

517
00:30:14.629 --> 00:30:15.929
And it was Michael Jordan.

518
00:30:16.813 --> 00:30:18.890
Uh. yeah. I probably
shouldn't have done that.

519
00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:20.350
Jordan didn't mince words with me.

520
00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:23.363
And I quote. you could lose
your stripes for this. dog.

521
00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.040
And though I didn't have that on tape.

522
00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.050
when I went back to the
locker room after the game.

523
00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:29.720
I caught him starting to scold

524
00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:32.562
another young reporter
doing the same thing.

525
00:30:32.562 --> 00:30:34.071
- [Reporter] Can you sign this for me?

526
00:30:34.071 --> 00:30:35.115
- You're supposed to be working. man.

527
00:30:35.115 --> 00:30:37.400
You're not supposed to be getting an auto-

528
00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.920
- [Adam] When I got to
the hallway I asked Pippen

529
00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.210
for his autograph and he was very cool.

530
00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:43.480
And years later I realized it was quite

531
00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.830
a famous section of the Gund Arena hallway

532
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:47.603
outside the visiting locker room.

533
00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:50.423
This is where it all went down.

534
00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:53.330
Now. it wasn't my most professional moment

535
00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:56.600
and it kinda hurt that he felt less of me

536
00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:59.200
but hey. he was kind
enough to sign my jersey

537
00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.373
and 25 years later it's a family heirloom.

538
00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:06.650
(light music)

539
00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.910
Now there's a school of
thought that we all need

540
00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:14.120
to put down our cameras
and just take in the moment

541
00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.420
as things are happening.

542
00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:18.360
And I did indeed find myself so in awe

543
00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:20.293
that I just watched as a fan.

544
00:31:21.164 --> 00:31:23.664
(light music)

545
00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:28.610
But I have to say. I have
no memory of the game

546
00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:29.763
during these moments.

547
00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:33.840
25 years later these images are my memory

548
00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:36.590
and I presume in another
25 years I may find

549
00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:38.490
it hard to believe this even happened.

550
00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:41.680
So although I'm glad I took

551
00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.660
a few moments to just soak it in.

552
00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:47.090
I'm happier that those moments
were few and far between.

553
00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:50.493
Because that's Michael
Jordan walking towards me.

554
00:31:51.608 --> 00:31:54.108
(light music)

555
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.380
As the first half neared the end.

556
00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:58.820
I finally started to
concentrate on the game itself

557
00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:01.130
and not just the sights and sounds.

558
00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:03.030
I hadn't really paid
attention to how Jordan

559
00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:04.553
was doing until this moment.

560
00:32:05.729 --> 00:32:08.562
(crowd murmuring)

561
00:32:17.725 --> 00:32:20.399
- [Announcer] Foul on 23. Michael Jordan.

562
00:32:20.399 --> 00:32:22.493
That's his first.

563
00:32:22.493 --> 00:32:24.543
Terrell Brandon at the line for two.

564
00:32:26.666 --> 00:32:30.058
- [Heckler] Hey Jordan.
hey Michael. you're on six.

565
00:32:30.058 --> 00:32:32.808
That's okay. Bobby. shut it down.

566
00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.220
- [Announcer] Steve
Kerr back for the Bulls.

567
00:32:42.263 --> 00:32:44.384
- [Heckler] Hey Michael.
how are the shoes?

568
00:32:44.384 --> 00:32:46.234
Go back to the old one.

569
00:32:46.234 --> 00:32:47.567
You look better.

570
00:32:48.625 --> 00:32:51.375
(crowd cheering)

571
00:32:54.363 --> 00:32:56.570
- [Adam] When I looked back
over my footage and pictures.

572
00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:58.890
I realized this fan had
been messing with Jordan

573
00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:00.380
during the entire game.

574
00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:01.983
Including pregame warmups.

575
00:33:02.818 --> 00:33:05.568
(crowd cheering)

576
00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:15.857
And then you see the broadcast

577
00:33:15.857 --> 00:33:17.113
and he would stand up.

578
00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:21.480
I mean. he's an arm's length away

579
00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:22.830
from Pippen when he stands.

580
00:33:24.162 --> 00:33:26.995
(crowd murmuring)

581
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:37.655
- [Announcer] Foul on Terrell Brandon.

582
00:33:37.655 --> 00:33:38.488
That's his first.

583
00:33:38.488 --> 00:33:40.520
- [Adam] And if you listen closely.

584
00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.903
he'd been yelling well
before the shoes line.

585
00:33:44.627 --> 00:33:46.273
- [Heckler] Hey Jordan. you always got

586
00:33:46.273 --> 00:33:48.112
a night to leave him alone.

587
00:33:48.112 --> 00:33:48.945
Go easy!

588
00:33:49.979 --> 00:33:51.780
- [Adam] I guess he's
talking about Majerle here

589
00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:53.110
but if you know Jordan.

590
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:55.860
he's certainly not leaving Majerle alone.

591
00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:58.760
He infamously liked torturing
him when he was on the Suns.

592
00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:03.590
Now. Jordan was having a quiet first half

593
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:05.310
with only six points in the first quarter

594
00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:06.530
and zero in the second.

595
00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:08.750
Only attempting one shot.

596
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:10.710
He really didn't seem very engaged

597
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:13.260
and to be fair. Bobby Phills
was a really great defender.

598
00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:14.960
- [Announcer] 24 seconds to shoot.

599
00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:17.660
- [Adam] Sadly. he died in a car crash

600
00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:19.533
a little over four years after this.

601
00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:21.293
Such a shock.

602
00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:27.610
And Jordan wasn't the only
guy getting screamed at.

603
00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:28.950
Rodman was out with an injury

604
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:30.640
and Pippen was picking up his slack.

605
00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:32.913
Which brought the heckler's wrath on him.

606
00:34:35.339 --> 00:34:37.230
(whistle blowing)

607
00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:38.680
- [Announcer] Scottie Pippen.

608
00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:43.860
Foul on number nine. Dan Majerle.

609
00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:44.863
That's his first.

610
00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:48.510
Team first.

611
00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:49.860
Scottie Pippen at the line.

612
00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:52.200
- [Bench] One shot.

613
00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:59.542
- [Heckler] Hey Scottie.
you should've got a T.

614
00:34:59.542 --> 00:35:01.443
You were hanging onto the ref.

615
00:35:01.443 --> 00:35:02.520
We all know.

616
00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.520
- [Phil] Tend D. get out. get out. Tony.

617
00:35:08.141 --> 00:35:09.970
- [Adam] Whew. man he
is lucky he didn't get

618
00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:11.987
that ball thrown right back at him.

619
00:35:14.875 --> 00:35:17.958
- Hey Michael. it's all in the shoes!

620
00:35:19.693 --> 00:35:21.110
Come on. Majerle!

621
00:35:25.397 --> 00:35:27.310
- [Bench] Get up. let's go!

622
00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:29.891
- [Adam] And then Jordan fouls Brandon.

623
00:35:29.891 --> 00:35:31.684
(whistle blowing)

624
00:35:31.684 --> 00:35:34.443
And that's when the heckler
takes it one step too far.

625
00:35:38.084 --> 00:35:40.917
(crowd murmuring)

626
00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:49.345
- [Announcer] Foul on 23. Michael Jordan.

627
00:35:49.345 --> 00:35:51.433
That's his first.

628
00:35:51.433 --> 00:35:53.717
Terrell Brandon at the line for two.

629
00:35:55.831 --> 00:35:56.812
- [Heckler] Hey Jordan!

630
00:35:56.812 --> 00:35:59.059
Hey Michael. you're all washed up!

631
00:35:59.059 --> 00:36:02.142
That's the way. Bobby. shut him down!

632
00:36:05.144 --> 00:36:08.811
- [Announcer] Steve
Kerr back for the Bulls.

633
00:36:11.081 --> 00:36:13.030
- [Heckler] Hey Michael. how's the shoes?

634
00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:15.163
Go back to the old ones.

635
00:36:15.163 --> 00:36:16.496
You were better!

636
00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:23.503
- [Fan] Hey Jordan. your shoes are ugly!

637
00:36:24.438 --> 00:36:27.688
- [Heckler] Bobby Phills. you're great.

638
00:36:31.916 --> 00:36:34.657
- Were the shoes ugly. dad?

639
00:36:34.657 --> 00:36:35.563
- Uh. no.

640
00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:43.610
So I own two special pairs of shoes.

641
00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:45.110
You guys know about the first.

642
00:36:47.104 --> 00:36:49.010
These are the Nike Mags.

643
00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:51.290
And these are not the crappy ones I keep

644
00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:53.700
in the time machine.
these are the real ones.

645
00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:55.633
And the other pair of special shoes

646
00:36:55.633 --> 00:37:00.633
that I own are those ugly Concord 11's

647
00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:05.153
which are actually the most
famous Jordan shoes ever.

648
00:37:08.643 --> 00:37:09.476
- Whoa.

649
00:37:09.476 --> 00:37:10.411
- Aren't those awesome?

650
00:37:10.411 --> 00:37:11.244
- Whoa.

651
00:37:11.244 --> 00:37:12.077
- Yeah.

652
00:37:12.077 --> 00:37:14.323
And they have a special 45 on the back.

653
00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:17.980
Of all the shoes this man could

654
00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:22.050
have made fun of. he chose
the holy grail of Air Jordans.

655
00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:25.940
The most sought after.
most celebrated Jordans.

656
00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:28.550
The Jordans you can wear to church.

657
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:30.640
Your grand mama says. look nice for Jesus.

658
00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.560
put on your Concord 11's.

659
00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:35.070
Jordan wears these to weddings in a tuxedo

660
00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:36.710
for crying out loud.

661
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:38.993
The literal height of fashion.

662
00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:42.620
Then again. this dude's
struggling in that area.

663
00:37:44.524 --> 00:37:47.260
I mean I almost hate to
immortalize him forever in film

664
00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:49.950
but once you see how all this plays out.

665
00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:50.850
you'll understand.

666
00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:54.360
(funky music)

667
00:37:57.515 --> 00:37:59.930
- Would you like to wear them?

668
00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:01.530
- Unfortunately. I can't wear them.

669
00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:02.580
- Why?

670
00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:03.880
- These are dead stock.

671
00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.640
That means they've never been worn.

672
00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:06.473
never been touched.

673
00:38:06.473 --> 00:38:08.290
They're worth like over 500 dollars.

674
00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:09.230
- Over 500?

675
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:12.130
- Yeah. so you don't wear these.

676
00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:13.870
- What's the point of
owning a pair of shoes

677
00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:15.880
if you don't even wear 'em?

678
00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:16.880
- Um...

679
00:38:18.686 --> 00:38:20.391
That's a good point.

680
00:38:20.391 --> 00:38:22.690
Uh. I have no idea. anyway let's watch

681
00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:25.234
how he deals with this heckler.

682
00:38:25.234 --> 00:38:27.261
- [Announcer] Cavs ball.

683
00:38:27.261 --> 00:38:29.641
1.8 seconds remaining.

684
00:38:29.641 --> 00:38:30.558
Here we go.

685
00:38:38.104 --> 00:38:40.533
- [Heckler] He was going to the basket!

686
00:38:40.533 --> 00:38:42.616
You guys can't guard him!

687
00:38:47.746 --> 00:38:49.780
(buzzer)

688
00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:50.940
- [Announcer] At the half
the score of the Chicago--

689
00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:52.540
- [Adam] So that ended the half.

690
00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:55.280
And during halftime the Cavs premiered

691
00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.933
their new mascot. Whammer.

699
00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:26.553
- [Adam] I wish I could
tell you this gets better.

700
00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:30.180
But this is still eight
years before they got Lebron.

701
00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:33.503
And well. Cleveland's gonna Cleveland.

(cheering)

706
00:39:56.661 --> 00:39:59.494
(crowd murmuring)

707
00:40:12.034 --> 00:40:13.320
So the Bulls come back I decide

708
00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:14.640
to try out the snap shot feature

709
00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.010
a bit during warmups.

710
00:40:17.137 --> 00:40:20.220
(upbeat arena music)

711
00:41:03.922 --> 00:41:06.755
(whistle blowing)

712
00:41:16.776 --> 00:41:19.026
- [Announcer] Bobby Phills.

713
00:41:20.542 --> 00:41:23.042
(organ music)

714
00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:27.940
- [Adam] I cannot tell you how happy I am

715
00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:29.970
that I realized this was awful

716
00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:31.883
before I ruined any important shots.

717
00:41:34.061 --> 00:41:36.894
(whistle blowing)

718
00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:40.873
- [Announcer] Foul on 44. Michael Cage.

719
00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:43.413
That's his first. team first.

720
00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:48.200
- [Adam] So Jordan starts
to get more involved.

721
00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:55.085
- [Announcer] Michael Jordan.

722
00:41:55.085 --> 00:41:58.668
- [Bench] That's a good
shot baby. come on.

723
00:42:02.224 --> 00:42:04.641
- [Announcer] Michael Jordan.

724
00:42:07.522 --> 00:42:10.293
- [Coach] Time out. time out!

725
00:42:10.293 --> 00:42:12.392
- [Adam] And not just in scoring.

726
00:42:12.392 --> 00:42:15.142
- [Announcer] Cavaliers time out.

727
00:42:18.059 --> 00:42:21.142
(upbeat arena music)

728
00:42:28.133 --> 00:42:30.820
- [Adam] Jordan and Phil were
masters of planting seeds

729
00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:32.820
throughout a game to get calls later on.

730
00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:37.000
And literally the very next play

731
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.173
after this timeout.

732
00:42:39.164 --> 00:42:41.997
(crowd murmuring)

733
00:42:46.843 --> 00:42:49.676
(whistle blowing)

734
00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.180
Of course. the kid in me is thrilled

735
00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:00.420
as my Jordan at the line
picture meant so much

736
00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:01.790
to me when I took it.

737
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:04.470
And now I was actually
filming him at the line.

738
00:43:05.732 --> 00:43:08.482
(crowd cheering)

739
00:43:13.006 --> 00:43:14.690
These were the only
two free throws he shot

740
00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:16.150
the entire game.

741
00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:17.850
Which I thought was gonna
be a problem for them

742
00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:20.013
because the Cavs were stepping up.

743
00:43:21.707 --> 00:43:24.457
(crowd cheering)

744
00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:32.353
And unfortunately. some of
Jordan's team mates were not.

745
00:43:34.657 --> 00:43:36.657
- [Announcer] Cavs ball.

746
00:43:39.392 --> 00:43:41.979
♪ Hey. ho. let's go♪

747
00:43:41.979 --> 00:43:44.729
(crowd cheering)

748
00:43:59.873 --> 00:44:02.330
- [Adam] This may have made
the heckler pretty happy.

749
00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:05.270
But it made Jordan and Pippen take over.

750
00:44:07.003 --> 00:44:09.753
(crowd cheering)

751
00:44:12.977 --> 00:44:16.571
- [Announcer] Michael Jordan for three.

752
00:44:16.571 --> 00:44:19.321
(crowd cheering)

753
00:44:50.106 --> 00:44:52.363
- [Bench] That's a foul. 41!

754
00:44:52.363 --> 00:44:53.446
Come on. man.

755
00:44:54.568 --> 00:44:57.318
(crowd cheering)

756
00:45:08.418 --> 00:45:11.668
- [Announcer] Michael Jordan for three.

757
00:45:14.736 --> 00:45:18.319
Two minutes remaining
in the third quarter.

758
00:45:26.252 --> 00:45:29.002
(crowd cheering)

759
00:45:37.403 --> 00:45:38.236
Scottie Pippen.

760
00:45:38.236 --> 00:45:39.600
- Oh wait. wait. you gotta see this.

761
00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:41.315
You gotta see this.

762
00:45:41.315 --> 00:45:43.815
(light music)

763
00:45:45.265 --> 00:45:47.100
All right. see this basketball card?

764
00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:49.297
That was taken right at that moment.

765
00:45:51.447 --> 00:45:53.947
(light music)

766
00:45:56.759 --> 00:45:59.504
(crowd cheering)

767
00:45:59.504 --> 00:46:01.407
- [Announcer] Scottie Pippen.

768
00:46:01.407 --> 00:46:03.030
- What. it looks brand new.

769
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:05.050
- Yeah. see this is what
this video would look like

770
00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:06.200
if I had a real camera.

771
00:46:07.676 --> 00:46:09.687
(crowd cheering)

772
00:46:09.687 --> 00:46:12.128
- [Announcer] Time out. Cleveland.

773
00:46:12.128 --> 00:46:14.545
Cavaliers 20 second time out.

774
00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:20.470
- [Adam] Oh. and on the subject of Pippen.

775
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:21.690
with these free throws he had

776
00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:23.570
a triple-double in the third quarter.

777
00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:26.523
Ending up with 18. 13. and 12.

778
00:46:27.366 --> 00:46:28.330
I feel like he gets dismissed

779
00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:29.820
because Jordan's light was so bright

780
00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:32.440
but at the time. we all felt Scottie

781
00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:34.050
was the second best player in the league.

782
00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:35.600
not just this team.

783
00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:37.250
He did everything.

784
00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:38.620
And was the best support system

785
00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:41.270
for a pure scorer like Jordan
that there's ever been.

786
00:46:42.552 --> 00:46:44.470
And then with Rodman
simply wanting to rebound

787
00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:46.820
and give it to others to score.

788
00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:49.180
I mean. that team was
a perfect storm managed

789
00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:50.563
by a brilliant coach.

790
00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:53.793
What a thing to witness.

791
00:46:53.793 --> 00:46:57.000
- [Announcer] Foul is on
Randy Brown. his third.

792
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.037
Team second.

793
00:46:59.823 --> 00:47:02.740
Danny Ferry back for the Cavaliers.

794
00:47:05.391 --> 00:47:08.224
- [Phil] Come on. MJ. come on Jud.

795
00:47:12.973 --> 00:47:15.254
- [Announcer] Jud Buechler. Michael Jordan

796
00:47:15.254 --> 00:47:17.233
back for Chicago.

797
00:47:17.233 --> 00:47:20.440
(crowd cheering)

798
00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:22.520
- [Adam] So Jordan comes back
in. giving Scottie a rest.

799
00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:24.447
and the fan is still jawing.

800
00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:32.337
- [Heckler] Hey Jud. we're
gonna use the same lineup.

801
00:47:33.551 --> 00:47:36.384
(crowd murmuring)

802
00:47:53.878 --> 00:47:55.951
(crowd cheering)

803
00:47:55.951 --> 00:47:58.809
- [Announcer] Michael Jordan for three.

804
00:47:58.809 --> 00:48:02.059
Time out Cleveland. Cavaliers time out.

805
00:48:03.164 --> 00:48:05.997
(crowd murmuring)

806
00:48:29.819 --> 00:48:31.169
(whistle blowing)

807
00:48:31.169 --> 00:48:33.169
- [Announcer] Cavs ball.

808
00:48:34.493 --> 00:48:35.990
- [Adam] Man. that look when Jordan

809
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:37.493
is disappointed with you.

810
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.250
I know how you feel. Kukoc.

811
00:48:48.978 --> 00:48:51.224
Made that fan happy. though.

812
00:48:51.224 --> 00:48:54.377
(crowd murmuring)

813
00:48:54.377 --> 00:48:57.627
- [Bench] Same play. same play. charge.

814
00:48:59.491 --> 00:49:01.447
Here he comes. Jud. he's coming back.

815
00:49:01.447 --> 00:49:02.690
- [Adam] All of this leading to one

816
00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:05.130
of the most memorable answers to a heckler

817
00:49:05.130 --> 00:49:06.300
I've ever seen.

818
00:49:08.295 --> 00:49:10.295
- [Phil] Come on. Michael.

819
00:49:10.295 --> 00:49:14.462
- [Heckler] Hey Michael.
ya got 20 is that enough?

820
00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:21.960
(buzzer)

821
00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:24.377
- [Announcer] Michael Jordan.

822
00:49:26.656 --> 00:49:27.638
- [Bench] Nice shot.

823
00:49:27.638 --> 00:49:30.100
Steve. talk. talk. talk!

824
00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:31.720
- [Adam] Now at this
point I still wasn't sure

825
00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:33.830
if Jordan heard all of
this or if he was just so

826
00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:35.931
in the moment he blocked it out.

827
00:49:35.931 --> 00:49:36.870
- [Announcer] Bobby Phills.

828
00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:40.120
- [Adam] After this shot
to go up 16. however.

829
00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:41.063
I got my answer.

830
00:49:45.168 --> 00:49:46.738
(crowd cheering)

831
00:49:46.738 --> 00:49:49.988
- [Announcer] Michael Jordan for three.

832
00:49:52.530 --> 00:49:53.830
- [Adam] He literally points at him

833
00:49:53.830 --> 00:49:55.903
and yells right back.

834
00:50:00.512 --> 00:50:01.800
Now. I've slowed this down as much

835
00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:04.010
as possible because I'm
dying to know what he said

836
00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:07.380
and the only part I can
make out is. keep talking.

837
00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:08.213
Keep talking.

838
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:10.583
Keep talking.

839
00:50:12.141 --> 00:50:14.641
(funky music)

840
00:50:16.408 --> 00:50:18.230
And the fan does.

841
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:19.883
He gets right back in his face.

842
00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:26.210
Dude is uncomfortably close to Jordan here

843
00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:28.810
and I'm actually stunned
the ref didn't talk to him.

844
00:50:32.130 --> 00:50:34.440
But after this. MJ knew
the game was sealed

845
00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:35.410
and he was in good spirits.

846
00:50:35.410 --> 00:50:37.117
- [Announcer] Foul is on Michael Jordan.

847
00:50:37.117 --> 00:50:39.311
- [Adam] It was the only
time I saw him smile

848
00:50:39.311 --> 00:50:40.144
the whole game.

849
00:50:40.144 --> 00:50:43.015
- [Announcer] That's his
third penalty situation.

850
00:50:43.015 --> 00:50:45.848
(crowd murmuring)

851
00:50:48.904 --> 00:50:50.265
Chris mills at the line.

852
00:50:50.265 --> 00:50:52.938
One. plus the penalty for two.

853
00:50:52.938 --> 00:50:55.771
(crowd murmuring)

854
00:51:06.934 --> 00:51:10.358
- [Phil] All right here we go. five pass.

855
00:51:10.358 --> 00:51:11.953
- [Fan] Michael!

856
00:51:11.953 --> 00:51:14.203
- [Phil] Reverse five pass.

857
00:51:17.337 --> 00:51:18.254
- Let's go.

858
00:51:19.496 --> 00:51:23.157
- [Phil] Gotta push it up. push it up.

859
00:51:23.157 --> 00:51:24.990
One. two. three. pass.

860
00:51:26.745 --> 00:51:27.578
Four.

861
00:51:28.756 --> 00:51:29.589
Five.

862
00:51:37.279 --> 00:51:39.170
(crowd cheering)

863
00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:42.161
- [Announcer] Michael Jordan.

864
00:51:42.161 --> 00:51:43.680
- [Bench] Kerr. it's the ball.

865
00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:45.778
- [Phil] Heads up. isolation play.

866
00:51:45.778 --> 00:51:46.960
- [Bench] Screen low. screen low!

867
00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:49.310
- [Adam] The Cavs were
still scrapping. though.

868
00:51:54.218 --> 00:51:56.139
(cheering)

869
00:51:56.139 --> 00:51:58.642
- [Announcer] Bobby Phills.

870
00:51:58.642 --> 00:52:01.392
(crowd cheering)

871
00:52:04.227 --> 00:52:06.150
- [Adam] But it made little difference

872
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:09.293
as MJ gets his 23rd point of the half.

873
00:52:13.595 --> 00:52:16.012
- [Announcer] Michael Jordan.

874
00:52:19.335 --> 00:52:20.860
(buzzer)

875
00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:23.263
No shot. 24 second violation.

876
00:52:26.437 --> 00:52:27.560
- [Adam] He goes to the bench

877
00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:29.210
and you see him look over at the fan

878
00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:30.303
who is still talking.

879
00:52:32.594 --> 00:52:34.850
And realized at the time
I couldn't see his face

880
00:52:34.850 --> 00:52:36.350
when he was jawing at the fan.

881
00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:39.493
Oh. but I saw this.

882
00:52:42.016 --> 00:52:43.034
- [Announcer] Two minutes.

883
00:52:43.034 --> 00:52:47.130
Less than two minutes
remaining. fourth quarter.

884
00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:48.340
- [Adam] I couldn't believe
I was capturing this

885
00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:50.140
and zoomed over to see his reaction.

886
00:52:51.939 --> 00:52:54.670
- [Announcer] Jason Caffey.

887
00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:56.540
- [Adam] Listen. I know Jordan's infamous

888
00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:58.230
about taking things personal.

889
00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:59.630
But it still blows my mind

890
00:52:59.630 --> 00:53:00.820
that he would take something personal

891
00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:02.963
from someone so inconsequential.

892
00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:09.390
But years later I looked him up

893
00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:13.270
and his name was Eddie Nahra
and he was infamous for this.

894
00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:14.690
The heckler.

895
00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:16.100
Every Cavs player knew him

896
00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:17.550
and he'd always show up to big games

897
00:53:17.550 --> 00:53:20.373
with a court side seat and
berate the opposing team.

898
00:53:21.550 --> 00:53:23.920
He did the same at college
and high school games

899
00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:25.920
and rumor has it he did
this at a hockey game

900
00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:28.253
and a Buffalo player
clocked him in the eye.

901
00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:31.590
And what seems especially cruel

902
00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:36.053
is he died in 2002. the year
before the Cavs got Lebron.

903
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:39.323
So he never got to see 'em win it.

904
00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:46.010
But thank you. Eddie. because you created

905
00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:48.030
an indelible memory for me.

906
00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:50.880
And now countless people get
to see Jordan spar with you.

907
00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:54.420
I'm thrilled I was able
to put this together

908
00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:56.343
and immortalize your devotion.

909
00:53:58.540 --> 00:54:00.393
But yeah. shut up. dude.

910
00:54:02.736 --> 00:54:04.286
- I'm gonna go play basketball.

911
00:54:06.010 --> 00:54:07.180
- Okay.

912
00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:08.330
And then I got to go back into

913
00:54:08.330 --> 00:54:09.880
the locker room after the game.

914
00:54:12.550 --> 00:54:14.673
- [Reporter] Saving it all
up for the second half?

915
00:54:16.032 --> 00:54:17.505
- Two halves to a game.

916
00:54:17.505 --> 00:54:20.277
You know. I think the first half I was.

917
00:54:20.277 --> 00:54:23.332
you know. I really wasn't
in the game that much.

918
00:54:23.332 --> 00:54:25.190
So I felt real rested in the second half.

919
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:26.140
- [Reporter] I know they rotate

920
00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:27.650
and double a lot on defense

921
00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:29.910
but were you surprised they
were leaving you open so much

922
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:30.900
on the 3-point line?

923
00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:31.830
- I don't think they could find me.

924
00:54:31.830 --> 00:54:34.025
Second half I was more
at the top. you know.

925
00:54:34.025 --> 00:54:36.580
and before I was in the post
they were double teaming me

926
00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:38.730
and it was easy for them to stay on me.

927
00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:40.267
And then when I got outta the post

928
00:54:40.267 --> 00:54:41.790
and was able to move around a little bit

929
00:54:41.790 --> 00:54:42.700
it made it tough for them to try

930
00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:43.800
and keep an eye on me.

931
00:54:44.847 --> 00:54:46.783
But in the post the first half they did

932
00:54:46.783 --> 00:54:48.740
a good job of getting
the ball out of my hands.

933
00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:49.580
- [Reporter] Michael. that run at the end

934
00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:51.372
of the third quarter into the fourth

935
00:54:51.372 --> 00:54:53.199
it kind of really
separated you guys tonight.

936
00:54:53.199 --> 00:54:55.490
It really kind of took off after that.

937
00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:56.954
- Well. I think in the second half

938
00:54:56.954 --> 00:54:58.804
we really had a couple good stretches

939
00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:01.020
throughout the second half.

940
00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:03.442
And then we were able to. as you said.

941
00:55:03.442 --> 00:55:05.050
separate ourselves from them.

942
00:55:05.050 --> 00:55:06.460
Rebounding wise. open court. you know

943
00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:09.380
we were able to get some
penetration to the defense

944
00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:11.933
and we really put some pressure on them.

945
00:55:11.933 --> 00:55:14.350
- [Reporter] You got nice bench
help tonight too. didn't ya?

946
00:55:14.350 --> 00:55:16.720
- Yeah. everyone contributed off the bench

947
00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:20.170
and Steve Kerr came in and
gave us some good minutes

948
00:55:20.170 --> 00:55:21.800
and Jud Buechler came in.

949
00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:23.718
Dickey Simpkins stepped
in the starting lineup

950
00:55:23.718 --> 00:55:24.551
and gave us a few minutes.

951
00:55:24.551 --> 00:55:28.625
So I think that's the
good sign for this team

952
00:55:28.625 --> 00:55:30.329
is to be able to expand your roles

953
00:55:30.329 --> 00:55:31.980
when one player's not in the game.

954
00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:34.000
And you know. be very productive.

955
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.330
- [Reporter] Can you
feel anything this early

956
00:55:35.330 --> 00:55:38.560
about this team. it's still
very early in the season.

957
00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:41.440
about where this team
is going at this point?

958
00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:43.210
- Well. I think as you see. we've learned

959
00:55:43.210 --> 00:55:45.420
how to expand our roles
in situations like that.

960
00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:46.450
So that's a good sign.

961
00:55:46.450 --> 00:55:48.080
Defensively we're showing great signs

962
00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:50.067
where we can clamp down teams

963
00:55:50.067 --> 00:55:52.360
and make a difference between them and us.

964
00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:54.330
So. we're showing good signs.

965
00:55:54.330 --> 00:55:56.060
Are we where we wanna be? No.

966
00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:57.780
The way we're doing it.

967
00:55:57.780 --> 00:56:00.130
I think we have to do that
consistently throughout the game.

968
00:56:00.130 --> 00:56:02.009
- [Reporter] Wait. so
how about Bobby Phills?

969
00:56:02.009 --> 00:56:03.050
He seems like he's kinda
playing ya better and better

970
00:56:03.050 --> 00:56:04.631
as time's going by.

971
00:56:04.631 --> 00:56:05.630
Can you comment on that?

972
00:56:05.630 --> 00:56:07.450
- Well. I think. you know. the difference

973
00:56:07.450 --> 00:56:09.963
between him and Ehlo
or whatever. you know.

974
00:56:09.963 --> 00:56:12.250
Ehlo in the time that I was
playing here in Cleveland.

975
00:56:12.250 --> 00:56:13.400
they never double teamed.

976
00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:14.990
Here he knows he's got double team coming.

977
00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:19.045
So. he plays pretty sturdy
and very solid in the post

978
00:56:19.045 --> 00:56:20.128
and wherever.

979
00:56:21.364 --> 00:56:23.019
Second half I was able to get him in

980
00:56:23.019 --> 00:56:26.960
an open court situation
where I could get at--

981
00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:28.590
- [Adam] So I debated
whether to mention this

982
00:56:28.590 --> 00:56:31.200
but considering you can
literally see Scottie trying

983
00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:33.330
to put his pants on and mind you I'm not

984
00:56:33.330 --> 00:56:36.470
the only camera rolling.
it bears mentioning.

985
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:39.870
post game locker room
interviews are insane.

986
00:56:39.870 --> 00:56:41.950
And in the '90s it became a massive debate

987
00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:43.500
after the Zeke Mowatt incident.

988
00:56:44.350 --> 00:56:46.640
Everyone wanted to focus
on female reporters

989
00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:48.580
in the locker room but the truth is.

990
00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:50.713
none of us should be in the locker room.

991
00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:54.270
Before this Scottie came
out in just a towel.

992
00:56:54.270 --> 00:56:57.530
And a female reporter and
I saw way. way. way more

993
00:56:57.530 --> 00:56:59.870
than we should have and
promptly turned our heads

994
00:56:59.870 --> 00:57:01.110
out of respect.

995
00:57:01.110 --> 00:57:03.820
It was wildly uncomfortable
but the only way

996
00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:06.290
any of us could do our job.

997
00:57:06.290 --> 00:57:09.080
25 years later. this is
somehow still a thing

998
00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:11.350
and I'll never understand it.

999
00:57:11.350 --> 00:57:13.860
For bigger games they simply
setup a press conference

1000
00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:15.850
and the players come there
after they're dressed

1001
00:57:15.850 --> 00:57:18.750
for a controlled question
and answer period.

1002
00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:20.330
And now because of COVID.

1003
00:57:20.330 --> 00:57:22.550
I have to wonder if the days
of locker room interviews

1004
00:57:22.550 --> 00:57:24.000
are going to be a thing of the past

1005
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.180
once athletes get used to not being forced

1006
00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:29.990
into corners and grilled
before even getting dressed.

1007
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:33.670
It's a wildly unnecessary
relic of the past.

1008
00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:34.970
Hopefully.

1009
00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:35.960
- [Reporter] Pippen
picked up the rebounding

1010
00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:38.800
slot without Rodman. he had 13 tonight.

1011
00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:40.610
Is he a better rebounder now than when

1012
00:57:40.610 --> 00:57:42.530
you were playing before
is it just the fact

1013
00:57:42.530 --> 00:57:44.030
that he had other rebounders back then?

1014
00:57:44.030 --> 00:57:45.303
- We had other rebounders back then.

1015
00:57:45.303 --> 00:57:47.660
I think he didn't really
have to it as often

1016
00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:49.280
with Parks and with Bill.

1017
00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:52.340
You know. I think he's been able to always

1018
00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:55.210
expand his roles and I think that's a sign

1019
00:57:55.210 --> 00:57:56.930
of greatness for him.

1020
00:57:56.930 --> 00:57:59.490
And tonight he expanded his. you know.

1021
00:57:59.490 --> 00:58:01.650
rebounding area and
certainly in assists there.

1022
00:58:01.650 --> 00:58:03.100
- [Reporter] Michael. when you don't have

1023
00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:04.977
a first half that's a good one.

1024
00:58:04.977 --> 00:58:06.760
do you just say to yourself at halftime

1025
00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:08.300
or some point in the second half. like.

1026
00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:11.540
no matter. no worry. I'll
get hot in the second half?

1027
00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:14.150
- Well. I just. I mean even when I'm

1028
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:17.082
in the first half. I mean
I only had eight shots

1029
00:58:17.082 --> 00:58:18.550
and I was still in the game.

1030
00:58:18.550 --> 00:58:20.480
I just had to figure out ways to attack

1031
00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:22.220
the defense in order to get myself

1032
00:58:22.220 --> 00:58:24.210
in the rhythm of the game.

1033
00:58:24.210 --> 00:58:26.564
And was able to do that in the second half

1034
00:58:26.564 --> 00:58:27.460
with the three point shooting.

1035
00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:30.007
Which extended the
defense a little bit more

1036
00:58:30.007 --> 00:58:32.869
and I was able to get some isolations too.

1037
00:58:32.869 --> 00:58:33.900
- [Reporter] This team.
your team. seems like

1038
00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:34.810
they've reloaded.

1039
00:58:34.810 --> 00:58:36.530
You guys are ready to go
for another run this year.

1040
00:58:36.530 --> 00:58:38.700
For the Cavs. they've
almost hit. you know.

1041
00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:40.300
they've gotta start all over.

1042
00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:42.140
I mean is it. seeing 'em this year

1043
00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:44.820
and seeing Mark Price gone
and John Williams. I mean.

1044
00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:46.370
your comments on their team as a whole?

1045
00:58:46.370 --> 00:58:47.540
- It's different level.

1046
00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:50.080
Through injuries. through
trades. through retirement.

1047
00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:53.585
I mean. they're sure not the
Cavs from four years ago.

1048
00:58:53.585 --> 00:58:55.290
But they got a good solid
base with Mills and Phills

1049
00:58:55.290 --> 00:58:59.210
and Bob Sura and Brandon.

1050
00:58:59.210 --> 00:59:02.040
I think now they can
start building from inside

1051
00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:04.620
and extend themselves a little bit better.

1052
00:59:04.620 --> 00:59:07.050
But they've made some unbelievable changes

1053
00:59:07.050 --> 00:59:10.300
and now I think they're
trying to build things back up

1054
00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:13.350
and it may take some time.

1055
00:59:13.350 --> 00:59:15.065
- [Reporter] Thanks so much.

1056
00:59:15.065 --> 00:59:16.200
- [Interviewer] The whole
conference this year seems

1057
00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:18.450
to be very competitive.

1058
00:59:18.450 --> 00:59:21.300
Indiana and Orlando.
your thoughts on them?

1059
00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:22.753
- It'll be tough. you know. Orlando's

1060
00:59:22.753 --> 00:59:27.540
dealing with the loss
of Shaq and Indiana's

1061
00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:28.850
without a couple players.

1062
00:59:28.850 --> 00:59:31.670
So they gotta make some
adjustments here and there

1063
00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:33.170
whenever those people come back.

1064
00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:35.169
but you can believe both of them

1065
00:59:35.169 --> 00:59:37.590
are gonna be the teams
to beat in the East.

1066
00:59:37.590 --> 00:59:38.423
- [Reporter] Mike. thanks a lot.

1067
00:59:38.423 --> 00:59:39.400
Good luck to you the rest of the season.

1068
00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:41.127
- [Man] Hey. Melina told me to...

1069
00:59:42.138 --> 00:59:43.490
- Melina Cunnigham?
- Yeah.

1070
00:59:43.490 --> 00:59:44.323
- How's she doing?

1071
00:59:44.323 --> 00:59:45.156
- [Man] She's doing fine.

1072
00:59:45.156 --> 00:59:46.220
She should be up here
the next couple weeks.

1073
00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:47.290
- Is she?
- Yeah.

1074
00:59:47.290 --> 00:59:48.490
- Is she movin' up here?

1075
00:59:49.449 --> 00:59:51.240
- [Man] She's seeing Antonio Langham.

1076
00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:52.332
- She's where?

1077
00:59:52.332 --> 00:59:53.660
- [Man] She comes to
see Langham sometimes.

1078
00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:54.950
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

1079
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:56.300
- Ha. tell her I say. what's happening.

1080
00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:57.133
- Okay.
- Good girl.

1081
00:59:57.133 --> 00:59:58.633
- [Man] She told me to holler at you

1082
00:59:58.633 --> 00:59:59.466
at the Cavs game.

1083
00:59:59.466 --> 01:00:00.299
- All right.
- All right.

1084
01:00:00.299 --> 01:00:01.210
- [Adam] Once I saw Jordan in a good mood.

1085
01:00:01.210 --> 01:00:03.510
I knew it was my chance to ask a question.

1086
01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:05.688
- [Young Adam] Hey Mike.
now that you're like.

1087
01:00:05.688 --> 01:00:08.320
you're 4-0. do you think 66 more to go

1088
01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:10.840
to get to the 70 mark?

1089
01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.299
Or is that even on your mind now?

1090
01:00:12.299 --> 01:00:13.132
- Just take it game by game.

1091
01:00:13.132 --> 01:00:15.510
I don't think we're in
a rush to get to 70.

1092
01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:17.730
We just got a lot of time in between

1093
01:00:17.730 --> 01:00:19.610
and a lot of things to learn in between

1094
01:00:19.610 --> 01:00:21.970
so take it game by game.

1095
01:00:21.970 --> 01:00:24.060
- [Adam] I have now
regretted not asking Jordan

1096
01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:27.263
about the heckler for longer
than I was alive at that point.

1097
01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:32.300
It would have been the
perfect button to this story.

1098
01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:34.430
But you have to realize.
I didn't understand

1099
01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:38.620
the extent of the heckler until
after I watched my footage.

1100
01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:41.610
I only saw the "shh" and the fan laughing.

1101
01:00:41.610 --> 01:00:44.090
The idea of a team
winning 70 in one season

1102
01:00:44.090 --> 01:00:47.650
was a much bigger deal
and it had never happened.

1103
01:00:47.650 --> 01:00:50.710
But 25 years later. of course
they ended up winning 70

1104
01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:52.780
and winning everything
for the next three years.

1105
01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:55.640
And the stand out thing
that I capture that day

1106
01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:57.770
ended up being the side story.

1107
01:00:57.770 --> 01:00:59.630
about Jordan's remarkable ability

1108
01:00:59.630 --> 01:01:01.800
to turn anything into motivation.

1109
01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:03.810
So. it was no secret
that with the addition

1110
01:01:03.810 --> 01:01:06.510
of Rodman. this team
was going to be so good

1111
01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:10.330
they could eclipse the
all time record of 69-13.

1112
01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:13.133
But at this point.
considering it was game four.

1113
01:01:14.090 --> 01:01:16.450
no one had actually asked him.

1114
01:01:16.450 --> 01:01:18.673
So I got to be the first idiot to do so.

1115
01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:21.796
I'm kind of proud of that.

1116
01:01:21.796 --> 01:01:23.880
And glad it's cemented into NBA history.

1117
01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.138
- [Young Adam] Hey Mike
now that you're like.

1118
01:01:26.138 --> 01:01:28.630
you're 4-0. do you think 66 more to go

1119
01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:31.150
to get to the 70 mark?

1120
01:01:31.150 --> 01:01:32.410
Or is that even on your mind now?

1121
01:01:32.410 --> 01:01:34.185
- Just take it game by game.

1122
01:01:34.185 --> 01:01:35.880
I don't think we're in
a rush to get to 70.

1123
01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:38.060
We just got a lot of time in between

1124
01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:39.910
and a lot of things to learn in between.

1125
01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:41.783
So take it game by game.

1126
01:01:43.790 --> 01:01:46.140
- And that was my day with Michael Jordan.

1127
01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:48.613
- Can I go beat Cam at basketball?

1128
01:01:49.457 --> 01:01:51.686
- I would love that.

1129
01:01:51.686 --> 01:01:54.186
(light music)

1130
01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:12.550
My relationship with the NBA after Jordan

1131
01:02:12.550 --> 01:02:15.540
changed forever when in January of 2000

1132
01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:20.290
I finally moved to an
NBA city. Los Angeles.

1133
01:02:20.290 --> 01:02:23.140
And yes. that means I once
again lucked into following

1134
01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:25.210
greatness as Shaq. Kobe. and the Lakers

1135
01:02:25.210 --> 01:02:28.323
won the championship the first
three years I lived here.

1136
01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:32.053
And a decade later. Kobe
and Pau won it back to back.

1137
01:02:34.310 --> 01:02:36.220
Of course I had to watch
their first championship

1138
01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:39.270
on a web cam in the middle
of the night from Paris.

1139
01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:40.870
But you gotta support your team.

1140
01:02:41.746 --> 01:02:44.246
(light music)

1141
01:02:47.758 --> 01:02:49.200
Now. I still repped MJ.

1142
01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:51.490
You can't forget your roots.

1143
01:02:51.490 --> 01:02:53.890
But I lived in LA for over 20 years now

1144
01:02:53.890 --> 01:02:54.883
and it's my home.

1145
01:02:56.050 --> 01:02:58.740
(light music)

1146
01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:01.040
In 2010. YouTube move their time limit

1147
01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:03.170
from 10 minutes to 15 minutes.

1148
01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:04.580
Which meant I could finally upload

1149
01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:08.680
the original short I made
about meeting Michael in 1995.

1150
01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:12.113
Which really did just sit
in my closet for 15 years.

1151
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:14.560
The amazing thing about the short

1152
01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:16.300
was that it had to be edited live.

1153
01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:18.700
Meaning. I had two VCRs. a mixer.

1154
01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:21.210
a CD player. and a microphone.

1155
01:03:21.210 --> 01:03:24.350
And I got one take to
pull off the entire thing.

1156
01:03:24.350 --> 01:03:26.320
And I had to factor in the time it took

1157
01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:29.433
to switch out CDs while reading my script.

1158
01:03:30.590 --> 01:03:32.780
Screw up. start over.

1159
01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:34.253
15 straight minutes.

1160
01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:38.350
Might be my proudest
editing achievement to date.

1161
01:03:38.350 --> 01:03:40.160
And I did all that work just to show it

1162
01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:43.053
to four or five people back then. crazy.

1163
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:46.910
Also crazy was watching it go viral.

1164
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:48.320
I mean. when you wake up one morning

1165
01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:51.070
and the Washington Post
has written a story on it.

1166
01:03:51.070 --> 01:03:53.310
kinda hard to process.

1167
01:03:53.310 --> 01:03:55.810
(light music)

1168
01:03:56.650 --> 01:03:59.300
And although BroBible.com isn't exactly

1169
01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:01.500
the Washington Post. they included it

1170
01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:04.230
as part of their top 10
Jordan trash talking moments

1171
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:05.170
of all time.

1172
01:04:05.170 --> 01:04:07.600
And it audibly made me gasp.

1173
01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.550
To think that I somehow added something

1174
01:04:09.550 --> 01:04:11.410
to Jordan's legacy with my footage

1175
01:04:11.410 --> 01:04:13.680
the wouldn't have existed otherwise.

1176
01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:15.263
it kind of boggles the mind.

1177
01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:18.590
Also mind boggling is having kids

1178
01:04:18.590 --> 01:04:20.623
and having one that is basketball crazy.

1179
01:04:22.610 --> 01:04:24.720
To the point of it being
the dangling carrot

1180
01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:25.893
that made him walk.

1181
01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:31.520
- [Young Adam] Oh. there's five steps.

1182
01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:33.370
Yeah!

1183
01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:35.444
- [Adam] As well as being his first word.

1184
01:04:35.444 --> 01:04:36.978
- [Young Adam] Basketball!

1185
01:04:36.978 --> 01:04:38.061
- Basketball.

1186
01:04:39.290 --> 01:04:40.520
- [Adam] Too young to take him to games

1187
01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:42.830
but I was lucky enough to
score some player tickets

1188
01:04:42.830 --> 01:04:44.113
and meet some stars.

1189
01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:47.930
(light music)

1190
01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:54.280
I even hung out with Charles Barkley.

1191
01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:56.340
Thanks to my friend Mo'Kelly
literally calling me

1192
01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:59.090
and saying. do you wanna hang
out with Charles Barkley?

1193
01:05:00.392 --> 01:05:02.995
- The man. the myth. Sir Charles.

1194
01:05:02.995 --> 01:05:03.828
Thank you. thank you.

1195
01:05:03.828 --> 01:05:05.100
- Thank you. man. thank you.

1196
01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:05.933
- [Adam] Charles has to be one

1197
01:05:05.933 --> 01:05:07.713
of the nicest people I've ever met.

1198
01:05:09.210 --> 01:05:11.937
Got to watch Kobe's last game with my kid.

1199
01:05:11.937 --> 01:05:13.567
- Watch basketball.

1200
01:05:13.567 --> 01:05:15.445
- Do you wanna go to bed?

1201
01:05:15.445 --> 01:05:16.370
- No.

1202
01:05:16.370 --> 01:05:18.389
- Do you wanna watch
Kobe Bryant's last game?

1203
01:05:18.389 --> 01:05:19.222
- Yes!

1204
01:05:19.222 --> 01:05:21.603
- Ah. okay. that's what we're gonna do.

1205
01:05:21.603 --> 01:05:23.280
(light music)

1206
01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:24.740
And a few months later.

1207
01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:27.850
watch the team I felt
sorry for my whole life

1208
01:05:27.850 --> 01:05:30.080
finally get a chip.

1209
01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:31.683
Boy. did Cleveland deserve it.

1210
01:05:34.226 --> 01:05:35.440
And you may be wondering if I ever got

1211
01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:38.010
to see a basketball game
from up close again.

1212
01:05:38.010 --> 01:05:40.900
And well. I did.

1213
01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:43.490
And I brought a good camera with me.

1214
01:05:43.490 --> 01:05:45.710
What's crazy is. I had
brought pretty good cameras

1215
01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:47.730
with pretty good seats before.

1216
01:05:47.730 --> 01:05:49.290
But location is everything

1217
01:05:49.290 --> 01:05:52.279
and 10th row center gets you this.

1218
01:05:52.279 --> 01:05:54.540
(light music)

1219
01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:56.883
Goodness. is this not breath taking?

1220
01:05:59.492 --> 01:06:01.992
(light music)

1221
01:06:03.749 --> 01:06:06.597
Oh. to have had this technology in 1995.

1222
01:06:09.310 --> 01:06:11.060
Then again. that's what
makes what I was able

1223
01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:12.913
to capture back then so special.

1224
01:06:13.942 --> 01:06:16.442
(light music)

1225
01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:19.670
But to be in this section.

1226
01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:23.100
I mean. you're next to
the NBA Commissioner.

1227
01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:25.513
Magic Johnson comes up to say. hi.

1228
01:06:27.043 --> 01:06:29.543
(light music)

1229
01:06:32.830 --> 01:06:35.680
I mean. other than this not
being my childhood hero.

1230
01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:38.063
this felt a lot like 1995.

1231
01:06:40.156 --> 01:06:43.370
(crowd cheering)

1232
01:06:43.370 --> 01:06:45.860
Having a player from
the '90s still playing

1233
01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:47.423
also helped that feeling.

1234
01:06:48.590 --> 01:06:50.903
Vin-sanity. what can't this man do?

1235
01:06:53.050 --> 01:06:54.440
Even got a Hollywood ending

1236
01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:56.240
with Lebron getting the game winner.

1237
01:06:59.549 --> 01:07:02.024
(crowd cheering)

1238
01:07:02.024 --> 01:07:03.107
- Yeah. yeah!

1239
01:07:05.051 --> 01:07:07.301
(cheering)

1240
01:07:16.890 --> 01:07:21.013
- [Adam] And Tyson Chandler
sealing it with a block.

1241
01:07:21.013 --> 01:07:23.263
(cheering)

1242
01:07:30.433 --> 01:07:33.740
Now. this is a Laker town and
I am absolutely a Laker fan.

1243
01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:35.730
But the economic reality is.

1244
01:07:35.730 --> 01:07:37.700
if you're a family of four.

1245
01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:39.893
you're taking 'em to
a Clippers game first.

1246
01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:44.880
Which Cam ended up
loving. so I surprised him

1247
01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:46.030
with some better seats.

1248
01:07:50.350 --> 01:07:52.850
The last NBA game I
saw had the best ending

1249
01:07:52.850 --> 01:07:54.210
I've ever seen live.

1250
01:08:00.021 --> 01:08:02.771
(crowd cheering)

1251
01:08:07.651 --> 01:08:11.590
And then. of course. a few months later

1252
01:08:11.590 --> 01:08:13.360
our city had our hearts broken.

1253
01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:16.027
- Did you see this news?

1254
01:08:16.027 --> 01:08:16.980
- [Adam] What?

1255
01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:18.072
- About Kobe.

1256
01:08:18.072 --> 01:08:18.905
- [Adam] What?

1257
01:08:18.905 --> 01:08:21.990
- He died in a helicopter crash.

1258
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:23.320
- [Adam] I was lucky enough to be shooting

1259
01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:26.700
a commercial for my DeLorean
in Kobe's neighborhood.

1260
01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:28.513
And met him at this Starbucks.

1261
01:08:29.530 --> 01:08:31.650
I made him laugh bragging about my car.

1262
01:08:31.650 --> 01:08:32.700
which he appreciated.

1263
01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:37.150
His life after basketball was
far more inspirational to me

1264
01:08:37.150 --> 01:08:39.480
since we shared a mutual
love for filmmaking

1265
01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:40.930
and story telling.

1266
01:08:40.930 --> 01:08:43.663
As well as an obvious
devotion to our children.

1267
01:08:44.650 --> 01:08:47.143
I just knew I'd get to
work with him someday.

1268
01:08:53.090 --> 01:08:54.650
And wouldn't you know.

1269
01:08:54.650 --> 01:08:56.953
of all the people to
break down on that stage.

1270
01:08:57.870 --> 01:09:00.813
Jordan wrecked me in a way
I didn't know was possible.

1271
01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:05.160
Already crushed. I wept like a little boy

1272
01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:06.663
watching my hero in pain.

1273
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:11.393
And it was a reminder to
appreciate every moment.

1274
01:09:13.070 --> 01:09:15.613
Smell the flowers. eat the cake.

1275
01:09:16.998 --> 01:09:20.040
(light music)

1276
01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:20.990
And wear the shoes.

1277
01:09:23.439 --> 01:09:25.939
(light music)

1278
01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:55.623
Jordan ignited my passion
for the game of basketball.

1279
01:09:56.830 --> 01:09:59.143
But these comparison
arguments have to stop.

1280
01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:02.970
Lebron is unbelievable and has kept it up

1281
01:10:02.970 --> 01:10:04.990
for nearly 20 years.

1282
01:10:04.990 --> 01:10:05.823
Enjoy it.

1283
01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:10.770
KD is amazing. Steph is amazing.
Harden. Westbrook. Luka.

1284
01:10:10.770 --> 01:10:12.960
Giannis. we have to stop trying

1285
01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:16.110
to find every way they're
not as good as Jordan.

1286
01:10:16.110 --> 01:10:18.520
While conveniently forgetting his flaws.

1287
01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:20.783
and just enjoy the game of basketball.

1288
01:10:21.977 --> 01:10:24.477
(light music)

1289
01:10:25.890 --> 01:10:28.103
Cheer for everyone to be their best.

1290
01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:31.163
Isn't that what we teach our kids?

1291
01:10:32.269 --> 01:10:34.769
(light music)

1292
01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:41.800
Work hard. learn the fundamentals.

1293
01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:43.983
Keep pushing and be the best you can.

1294
01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:49.900
Hating on players that are winning now

1295
01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:51.530
or undermining their achievements

1296
01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:52.653
belittles the game.

1297
01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:55.803
The game is great.

1298
01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:59.040
And tomorrow is not guaranteed.

1299
01:11:13.435 --> 01:11:16.018

you could have lost your job like.

1343
01:13:53.124 --> 01:13:54.890
you could have lost your job.

1344

01:13:56.540 --> 01:13:57.910

1346
01:13:57.910 --> 01:13:59.900
- Uh. just disappointed.

1347
01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:01.550
It's unprofessional. you know.

1348
01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:02.880
I coulda lost my job.

1349
01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:04.307
- You coulda lost your job?

1350
01:14:05.290 --> 01:14:07.030
- Yeah. weren't you
gonna say it differently?

1351
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:08.720
Oh I. all right. I won't say it.

1352
01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:09.553
You say it.

1353
01:14:09.553 --> 01:14:10.670
You coulda lost your job.

1354
01:14:10.670 --> 01:14:11.941
All right. go ahead.

1355
01:14:11.941 --> 01:14:13.150
- You said it. so I had to say it.

1356
01:14:13.150 --> 01:14:14.270
- Right. yeah. I know.

1357
01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:15.783
Okay so. my bad.

1358
01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:18.823
- Can we stop the camera?

1359
01:14:18.823 --> 01:14:19.656
- Go. you ready?

1360
01:14:19.656 --> 01:14:20.593
And go. don't look at the camera. go.

1361
01:14:22.230 --> 01:14:24.084
- Was he mad at you?

1362
01:14:24.084 --> 01:14:25.410
- Uh. just disappointed.

1363
01:14:25.410 --> 01:14:26.290
It was unprofessional.

1364
01:14:26.290 --> 01:14:27.620
I was supposed to be working.

1365
01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:29.215
not asking for autographs.

1366
01:14:29.215 --> 01:14:31.130
- You coulda lost your job.

1367
01:14:31.130 --> 01:14:32.873
- I. yeah. I could have.

1368
01:14:35.205 --> 01:14:37.130
It was Michael Jordan. dude.

1369
01:14:37.130 --> 01:14:38.080
I don't know what to tell ya.

1370
01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:41.470
I did. I risked my job
to get that autograph.

1371
01:14:41.470 --> 01:14:42.680
But I didn't lose my job.

1372
01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:43.513
You're mad at me?

1373
01:14:43.513 --> 01:14:44.720
Like I did something wrong.

1374
01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:45.553
I'm sorry.

1375
01:14:47.089 --> 01:14:49.110
- You took his jersey.

1376
01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:49.943
- No. no. no.

1377
01:14:49.943 --> 01:14:50.776
That was my jersey.

1378
01:14:50.776 --> 01:14:51.609
I had it on under my shirt.

1379
01:14:51.609 --> 01:14:53.370
I didn't take his jersey. dude.

1380
01:14:53.370 --> 01:14:54.913
I just had. I took my shirt out

1381
01:14:54.913 --> 01:14:56.934
and was like. yo. can you sign this?

1382
01:14:56.934 --> 01:14:59.090
And he was like. you could
lose your stripes for this.

1383
01:14:59.090 --> 01:15:01.100
He was a little disappointed in me.

1384
01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:04.422
but I hope you understand now. Michael.

1385
01:15:04.422 --> 01:15:07.005
(upbeat music)
