00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.880
Spotter one in position.

4
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.960
Hillbrow spotter is good.

5
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.320
Van is set. Comms check.

6
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.280
Crossing Mandela Bridge.

7
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.320
On fire!

8
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.800
Van. spotter.
Armored truck is pulling up.

9
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.680
Chili. the gold has arrived.

10
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.520
Got it. There in five.

11
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.320
Let's do it!

12
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.320
Van. spotter. the gold has arrived.

13
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.120
Hands on the money. Hands on the money.

14
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.520
No man. Shoes. This is bullshit.

15
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.800
Total bullshit. Will never work.

16
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.720
Name the crooks we took to court.

17
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.640
Last two years.

18
00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.600
Last six months.

19
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.240
Cocaine Brothers.

20
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.240
Case dismissed.

21
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.320
Then acquitted.

22
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.120
Quit playing.

23
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.000
That is why I am telling you.

24
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.480
Get his hands on the money.

25
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.440
or it will be the same.

26
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.760
No conviction.

27
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.520
This guy? This gangster?

28
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.480
This. this. this thug?!

29
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.520
He sends people
into the belly of the earth!

30
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.520
To dig with their bare hands.

31
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.240
every day.
rocks collapsing and children die.

32
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.200
I know. brother. I know.

33
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.760
Last time we took him to court.

34
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.440
he paid off the prosecutor. And walked.

35
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.240
Let's be honest. brother.

36
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.360
We didn't have the evidence.

37
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.280
Case was weak.

38
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.640
Listen to me.

39
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.120
This is what's going to happen.

40
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.360
I'm taking him out.

41
00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.800
We are officers of the law.

42
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.600
Not murderers. I have small kids.

43
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.840
Two kids and the third on the way.

44
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.080
I won't go to jail
over something I don't agree with.

45
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.560
I'm asking one thing.

46
00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.040
Hands on the money. Hands on the money.

47
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.920
We’re going to need a better briefcase.

48
00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.920
No man. Shoes.

49
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.520
what have you gotten me into?

50
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.240
What kind of place is this?

51
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.240
Fashionistas.

52
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.080
Relax. brother. You look awesome.

53
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.640
Like a peacock.

54
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.440
Get lost man. a peacock!?

55
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.240
It's from home. I'll get back to you.

56
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.040
What? Now? I'm here! What call?

57
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.400
My wife had cramps this morning.

58
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.960
I'll get back to you.

59
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.520
Hold on.

60
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.400
-It's happening.
-What? Now?

61
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.160
-Shoes. now.
-Now?

62
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.240
Now. Now!

63
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.400
-Right now?
-Right now! Where are you?

64
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.120
I'm in a hectic situation.

65
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.760
I'll be there as soon as I can. OK?

66
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.960
All right.

67
00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.400
I'm back.

68
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.520
Everything OK?

69
00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.400
I'm great and you?

70
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.080
So. boy or girl?

71
00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.400
Hopefully a boy.

72
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.480
Chili junior.

73
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.000
You're mad. Make your own baby.

74
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.720
We'll be green peacocks.

75
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.720
Listen. brother.

76
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.680
I'm proud of you.

77
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.520
You're a great father.

78
00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.240
That's true. that's true.

79
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.320
You know where we come from.

80
00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.320
Let's get to work.

81
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.120
Finish this thing.

82
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.240
Let's do it.

83
00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.320
There he is.

84
00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.720
The man himself.

85
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.160
The thug of all thugs.

86
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.880
The Hyena Man.

87
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.120
The dog of all dogs.

88
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.920
Underground hunter of gold.

89
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.720
Gangster top dog.

90
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.720
Motherfucker!

91
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.040
Cool it Chili. Cool it.

92
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.880
In the village where I come from.

93
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.640
in the land of Rerhabu Quququ.
Uzithinga Zithathu.

94
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.840
I am the unstoppable train

95
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.200
of the Mpondo people.

96
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.440
A train that goes all day and night.

97
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.680
A dog who pisses on fire.

98
00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.320
You dog!

99
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.160
You see.

100
00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.800
when a hyena laughs.

101
00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.280
the ancestors are unhappy.

102
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.080
Spirits have been angered.

103
00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.680
You see this one?

104
00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.320
This is Jonga.

105
00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.120
Jonga

106
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.920
protected me as a small boy.

107
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.520
from a young age.

108
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.240
He's watching you.

109
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.440
This hyena?

110
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.880
This scavenger?

111
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.960
I'm a lion.

112
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.120
I'll eat him alive.

113
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.360
Don't anger him. brother.

114
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.440
No one disrespects the hyena.

115
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.440
It will rip you apart.

116
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.520
Stop the bullshit.

117
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.600
Where is the gold?

118
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.720
Easy. brother. Easy.

119
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.240
We know that cops lie.

120
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.520
And crooks lie and deceive.

121
00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.040
But…

122
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:37.800
Gold...

123
00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.520
tells the truth.

124
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.160
Bring.

125
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:48.880
There we go.

126
00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:56.840
Great one.

127
00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.400
Very well.

128
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.240
Get lost!

129
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.960
You thug.

130
00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.640
Do you see this briefcase?

131
00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.600
This skin…

132
00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.440
is the skin of a crocodile.

133
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.200
And over here. is the skin.

134
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.680
of a snake.

135
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.280
My gift to you.

136
00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.440
Kill him!

137
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.640
Here!

138
00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.680
Get him. Jonga. Get him.

139
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:09.760
Get him!

140
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:39.120
We have a runner!

141
00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.680
Stop him!

142
00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.440
Shit!

143
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.800
Back off!

144
00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.800
Main exit! Main exit!

145
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.480
-Are you good?
-Yes. Valet. fetch the car!

146
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.480
Hey. fuck off!

147
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.760
Hey. you asshole!

148
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.720
Hey. you asshole!!

149
00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.760
Hey.

150
00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.120
He's headed into Hillbrow.

151
00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.120
Runner is in Hillbrow.

152
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.440
On my way. On my way.

153
00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.240
Out of the way! Out of the way!

154
00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.720
Old man. hold this bag.

155
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.680
I'm a cop. okay?
Hold this bag. Don't open it.

156
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.360
I'm serious. Don't open this bag!

157
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.120
-Hey!
-Use your gun!

158
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.280
I can't shoot in the city.

159
00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:58.000
Go! Go! Go!

160
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.320
Move! Move! Move!

161
00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.240
Where did he go?

162
00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.240
Fools!

163
00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.800
One. two. One. two.

164
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.680
Let's go! Let's go!

165
00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.840
Fuck off! Fuck off!

166
00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.320
Move!

167
00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.240
Shoes. where are you?

168
00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.960
He's on the Mandela Bridge!
Where are you?!

169
00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.840
I'm there. I'm there now.

170
00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.400
The baby is coming!

171
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.400
Just wait. just wait!

172
00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.000
This isn't a queue at Checkers!

173
00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:03.960
Yoh.

174
00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.720
My goodness!

175
00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:07.840
Where are you?!

176
00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.640
Come! Come right now!

177
00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.920
Where are you?!

178
00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.280
Shoot! Shoes!

179
00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.200
Shoot! Shoot!

180
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:21.840
Shoot!

181
00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:24.640
Shoot!

182
00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.360
Shoot! Shoes!

183
00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:31.520
Shoot this dog! Shoot this dog!

184
00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.000
Shoes!

185
00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.040
Where are you going?

186
00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.840
Got you!

187
00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.640
I told you that I'll catch you.

188
00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.440
I'm going to kill you. asshole.

189
00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.080
Don't do this.

190
00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.160
I'm serious. brother.

191
00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.040
Where is the gold?

192
00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.080
You didn't open the bag. right?

193
00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.640
I wasn't always like this. my boy.

194
00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.920
I used to be the best drill op.

195
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.960
There was an accident.

196
00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.320
Dynamite explosion.

197
00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.080
I lost my arm.

198
00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:26.520
I lost my job also.

199
00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:29.320
I know gold. my boy.

200
00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.440
I worked with it.

201
00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.720
for a very long time.

202
00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.360
Forgive me.

203
00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:57.560
This…

204
00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.560
is not gold.

205
00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.320
It's an iron called pyrite.

206
00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.080
Gentlemen.

207
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.760
You know what they say?

208
00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.720
The peach that is delicious.

209
00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:33.160
Tasty and sweet. Is the one.

210
00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.360
that has worms.

211
00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.320
Therefore. I am releasing

212
00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.120
the Hyena Man.

213
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.240
-What?
-Why?

214
00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.720
Don't ask me why.

215
00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.040
Lack of evidence.

216
00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.600
-Can't you see?
-We have footage of him taking the money.

217
00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.800
All that footage shows.

218
00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:53.480
is a cop trying
to shoot and kill the accused.

219
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.480
after this one was deceived by a big bag

220
00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.240
of fake iron pyrite.

221
00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.680
What-what. worthless rocks!

222
00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.800
Do you know how I got into this position?

223
00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.080
Youngest brigadier

224
00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:10.760
in this building.

225
00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.680
And... female.

226
00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.240
I see you.

227
00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:17.520
You think I dropped my panties.

228
00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:18.440
Not me.

229
00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.680
I…

230
00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:23.240
I have the General right here.

231
00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.840
Me and only me

232
00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.400
is taking care of his pockets.

233
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.400
I promised him that gold.

234
00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:41.240
Now. I must pay from my own pocket.

235
00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.120
or else I'm out on the streets.

236
00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.720
Do you see how you're costing me?

237
00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:49.920
Seriously. do you see?

238
00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.000
It's been so long. my friends.

239
00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.600
So long…

240
00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:00.720
I've been trying to get you an upgrade.

241
00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:04.400
Sit down with me...

242
00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.160
so we can eat together.

243
00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.320
Hey woman!

244
00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.480
I eat alone.

245
00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.560
In that case.

246
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.160
I'm sending you to the basement.

247
00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.840
-Exactly!
-With that Boer Van Zyl?

248
00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.960
To learn your lesson.

249
00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.600
with the "Black Danger".

250
00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.320
I will never work with that Afrikaner.

251
00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.840
-Understood?
-If you don't take your skinny legs

252
00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.600
to the basement.

253
00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.840
there's the door.

254
00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.040
It's wide open.

255
00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:16.600
I'm out.

256
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Don't worry. Brigadier. I'll talk to him.

257
00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.080
-Chili.
-What? What? What?

258
00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.560
-What are you doing. brother?
-That woman is sick.

259
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.720
Brother. this lady is just doing her job.

260
00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.360
-What's wrong with you?
-Wake up. man! Have you been hypnotized?

261
00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.480
What's wrong with you?

262
00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:36.960
I have kids. Please consider that. brother.

263
00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.400
I have mouths to feed.

264
00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:43.840
From now on.

265
00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.720
I'm no longer a cop.

266
00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.320
We achieve fuck all.

267
00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:52.920
Chili.

268
00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.520
Moshoeshoe.

269
00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:57.320
Yes. Ma'am?

270
00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.840
Without him.

271
00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.760
you are useless to me.

272
00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.960
The Ten Commandments. Do you know them?

273
00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:07.880
Yes!

274
00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:09.120
-Do you know them?
-Yes!

275
00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.240
What's first?

276
00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:11.880
Yes. boy.

277
00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.040
You must not steal.

278
00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:14.600
But what happens.

279
00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.120
If they steal from you first?

280
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.440
Hey? The second one?

281
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:24.840
Yes. boy.

282
00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.560
Don't sleep with your neighbor's wife.

283
00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.360
But what about...

284
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.440
if her husband is deceased?

285
00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:36.520
Hey?

286
00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:38.800
Third commandment.

287
00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:39.720
Yes. boy.

288
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:40.920
Do not kill.

289
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:41.880
Do not kill.

290
00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:43.800
That's bullshit!

291
00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.480
God said to kill the Amalekites.

292
00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.600
Man. woman. infant
and child. Kill them all!

293
00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.200
Context. Chili. Context.

294
00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:57.760
And the fourth commandment?

295
00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:00.960
-Honor your mother and father?
-No!

296
00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.080
Did they respect us?

297
00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.560
-They abandoned me at the hospital!
-They left me on the streets!

298
00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.200
I was born in a toilet. Why?

299
00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.240
-Is that respect?
-No!

300
00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.320
Order. order.

301
00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.720
-Did they respect us?
-Never!

302
00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.280
-Order!
-Never!

303
00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:16.400
Leave us for moment.
I need to speak to Chili.

304
00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.480
Be strong. You hear me?

305
00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:19.440
Bye.

306
00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.520
This building is falling apart.

307
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.080
You have to get a new place.

308
00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.400
Look. the roof is about to collapse.

309
00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.760
You need a new building.

310
00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.720
How will I pay for it?
There is no money here.

311
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.960
Even the little we used to
get from the council is gone.

312
00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.120
Those people are corrupt.

313
00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.080
And I owe the bank.

314
00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:41.480
How much?

315
00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.560
Fifteen grand a month for ten years.

316
00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.560
I'm going to close this place.

317
00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:47.560
Close it?

318
00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:49.520
What about these kids?

319
00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.040
I got a call from Shoes.

320
00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.040
Here we go.

321
00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.400
He says you resigned.

322
00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:03.800
-Chili?
-Yes?

323
00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.360
Maybe I could work here. with the children.

324
00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.320
No.

325
00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.040
-You're a bad influence.
-How?

326
00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.200
Come. I want to show you something.

327
00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.680
-What now?
-Come.

328
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.000
Take.

329
00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.320
Do you remember this picture?

330
00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.240
You and Shoes. five years old.

331
00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:31.960
You couldn't swim.

332
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.160
You almost drowned.

333
00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.920
The little fool tried to save you.

334
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000
but he couldn't swim either.

335
00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:42.200
I came running when I heard his scream.

336
00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.360
You never even thanked him.

337
00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.560
You know what. big brother.

338
00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:53.600
I'm done being a cop.

339
00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.120
We make no impact.

340
00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.320
You became a cop because
you wanted to make an impact?

341
00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.920
-Yes. sure.
-Bullshit.

342
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.520
Sure. make a difference for these kids.

343
00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.480
You became a cop Chili.

344
00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:07.040
because you wanted these
kids to see you as the man.

345
00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:10.600
Walk the streets like a big shot.
"There goes Big Cop Chili."

346
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:11.920
No. man.

347
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.240
Do you know who keeps you in line?

348
00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:15.680
It's Shoes.

349
00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:20.920
Without him.
you'd be in jail right now. or dead.

350
00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.200
You want to make an impact?

351
00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:25.680
Then show these kids the power

352
00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.280
of love and friendship.

353
00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.320
They know what you've been through.

354
00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.960
When they see you two as cops together.

355
00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.240
that is the impact.

356
00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:15.880
Hey. man.

357
00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.680
Why are you texting
me like I'm your girlfriend?

358
00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.040
You want to work with this Boer?

359
00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.280
How? I can't without you.

360
00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:40.680
Actually. leave.

361
00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:44.880
Thank you for saving my life.

362
00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:49.320
I love you. boy.

363
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.080
The lady of twelve ambitions
and thirteen accidents.

364
00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:10.720
Oh. please.

365
00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:15.600
Obviously missed.

366
00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.640
Graveyard.

367
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:35.840
Correct.

368
00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.680
And if you have nothing for me.

369
00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:42.680
It means I...

370
00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.920
have nothing for the General.

371
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.600
Bugger off. Van Zyl.

372
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.160
You... You are building nothing.

373
00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.120
Look at you.

374
00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.720
Because you
light-skinned idiots sitting here.

375
00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:17.200
will never. ever know anything
about a dark-skinned gang.

376
00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.880
You will never talk a hole in my head.

The Hyena Man.

380
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000
On what night did you say
these targets were hit?

381
00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:30.480
Tripe Monday.

382
00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:32.600
Tripe Monday.

383
00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:38.560
Can you see?

384
00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:42.600
Just five minutes with us Blacks
and more progress than the last 40 years.

385
00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:44.920
Because I'm adding apartheid.

That's it.

395
00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.360
We won't let you down. sir.

396
00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:22.720
You're not better than me!
What's wrong with you?!

397
00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.880
What will you do?

398
00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:15.320
You see what I see?

399
00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:16.800
That piece of shit.

400
00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:19.960
Yes. in the right outfit. for sure.

401
00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.320
Maybe he could work.

402
00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:26.680
Let's test him.

403
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.600
What you're doing is dumb.

404
00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:48.920
My dog. touch my blood.

405
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.440
Big man. Original gangster.

406
00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:53.000
Who's this fool?

407
00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:57.240
They call me Seeng.
Over there. my sister. Dimo.

408
00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:59.640
My brother. Dikeledi.

409

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.200
Hey. hey. my dog.

I feel like the dog of all dogs.

414
00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:20.680
A real baller.

415
00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:24.400
Actually. better than everyone.

416
00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:26.720
Here we have "Mr. Show-Off".

417
00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.800
You're the ones throwing money
and I'm "Mr. Show-Off"?

418
00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:31.600
My brother. My brother.

419
00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:33.600
We're spreading love.

420
00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:36.600
We're wasting our time with this guy.

421
00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.160
You call it from the air?

422
00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:40.240
Traffic cop?

423
00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.880
You have a big mouth. My brother is deaf.

424
00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.600
He might be deaf. but he sees.

425
00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.680
I want to see you

426
00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.680
give this money to the needy.

427
00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:53.440
not these greedy crooks in the street.

428
00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:55.040
Let me show you something.

429
00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.840
You see these kids?

430
00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:02.280
Kajama Home for abandoned children.

431
00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:05.680
Next time you want to show off.

432
00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.640
help these children.

433
00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:12.680
You grew up there?

434
00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:14.920
Yes.

435
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.160
My mother abandoned me.

436
00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:20.600
My old man didn't give a fuck.

437
00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:22.200
I grew up on the streets.

438
00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:27.840
Where do you get your money?

439
00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:32.000
He wants to know
if you're a thug or a fat cat?

440
00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:37.320
Let's drink. Have some.

441
00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.720
We don't drink.

442
00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:41.440
This is non-alcoholic. brother.

443
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.800
While fools drink.

444
00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:48.240
the clever get rich.

445
00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:50.040
Let it burn.

446
00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:51.160
Burn them all!

447
00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:03.720
We've got them.
Put the task team on standby.

448
00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:04.640
On it. Colonel.

449
00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:09.600
Men. hurry up.

450
00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:11.400
Do your best!

451
00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:36.920
Moshoeshoe. no. stop it!

452
00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:50.480
Come on. sir.

453
00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:52.440
Men. we must focus.

454
00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:00.120
Come on. Colonel.

455
00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:02.560
No. no. no. We must--

456
00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:18.520
Come on. sir.

457
00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:49.560
Get lost!

458
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.240
Hey. you broke bastard!

459
00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:55.560
Asshole.

460
00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:02.600
You touch a snake in its hole.

461
00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:04.880
Who do you think you are?

462
00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:07.200
Do you know who I am?

463
00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:39.040
Yes!

464
00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:51.840
Chili. we have to go.

465
00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:24.360
They're moving.

466
00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:32.200
Dimo. Dimo!

467
00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:33.800
-Let's go. let's go.
-Where are we going?

468
00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:35.040
Hurry!

469
00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:47.720
What's going on?

470
00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:58.640
Who are you?

471
00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:02.400
Are you some kind of gangster?

472
00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:11.920
I'm a cop.

473
00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:20.880
He's a cop.

474
00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:26.240
Fucking hope so.

475
00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:30.640
But not anymore. Not anymore.

476
00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:36.480
Bullshit procedure and corruption.

477
00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:39.360
But you. You... you. you gangsters.

478
00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:42.360
You need me.

479
00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:44.520
You need a guy like me.

480
00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:46.760
Why? Why is that?

481
00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:50.880
I know how cops think.

482
00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:54.160
Dimo.

483
00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:00.720
What do you think?

484
00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:17.440
My brother trusts you.

485
00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:20.560
Listen.

486
00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:23.560
We're not gangsters.

487
00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.880
What we do makes a difference.

488
00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.400
We've dedicated our lives to it.

489
00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:32.000
You can't come here
and mess up our work.

490
00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:36.240
Understood?

491
00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:39.960
Sure.

492
00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:42.040
Listen. man.

493
00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:44.800
Put your shiny clothes in that bin.

494
00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:45.760
Tonight…

495
00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:48.960
you prove yourself.

496
00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:52.840
Listen. guys. He's in.

497
00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:27.240
Colonel. the tracker is also dead.

498
00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:33.640
Where are they?

499
00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:34.920
Oh. there. There!

500
00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:40.440
Follow them! Go. go. go!

501
00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:10.720
This crooked jeweler.
works our people like slaves.

502
00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:12.920
They make his jewelry.

503
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.160
Then he sells it for a fortune
and they get fuck all.

504
00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:19.360
Five minutes.

505
00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:41.520
Take everything that is gold.

506
00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:43.280
Don't leave anything behind. Let's go!

507
00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:08.800
Shit. shit!

508
00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:09.800
Cops. cops. cops!

509
00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:11.800
-What?
-Let's go!

510
00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:23.760
Let's go. let's go!

511
00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:28.880
Go! Go!

512
00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:54.280
Fuckers.

513
00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:06.080
Give him your clothes.

514
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.040
Goddamn it!

515
00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:16.240
Back to the van.

516
00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:25.400
Fanie. any leads?

517
00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:30.160
Small hills give birth to mountains.

518
00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:32.720
-That's the one.
-Let's go!

519
00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:00.040
What is this place?

520
00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:01.720
Come this side.

521
00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:02.920
This is where we live.

522
00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:07.720
Welcome to our crib.

523
00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:09.720
Sotho people are too clever.

524
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:12.840
And this?

525
00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:15.560
Come.

526
00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:05.760
My children.

527
00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:08.800
I ask from the fires of hell.

528
00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:12.880
what the devil is this?

529
00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:13.880
Mom.

530
00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:16.120
Please. before you get angry.

531
00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:18.640
take a good look at him.

532
00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:30.880
Do you see what I see?

533
00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:33.360
Mom. we can finally do this.

534
00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:55.640
Don't use a short stick
to scratch a big lion’s balls.

535
00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:57.040
I know what you are doing.

536
00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:15.040
What are we doing here?

537
00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:17.560
This is where we melt the gold.

538
00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:22.440
This old lady
presses it into sheets of gold.

539
00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:24.920
And then. we cut it.

540
00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:27.600
Feed it into this beauty.

541
00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:31.160
1970 SA mint.

542
00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:34.640
Then we make coins.

543
00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:41.320
Can you believe it was sold for scrap?

544
00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:43.680
Bloody idiots.

545
00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:49.040
We mint Krugerrands.

546
00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:52.320
100% genuine.

547
00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:57.960
That coin is legal tender.

548
00:57:58.040 --> 00:57:59.120
The money is legit.

549
00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:03.120
You can walk into a gold exchange
with one of these bad boys

550
00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:05.040
and they'll give you 20 grand. cash.

551
00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:06.880
No questions asked.

552
00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:12.320
But what I really want to know.

553
00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:15.800
what's going on with my face?

554
00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:24.920
No. sir.

555
00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:54.360
Lerotholi Thoriso I. dictator of Lesotho.

556
00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:55.600
our home country.

557
00:58:57.160 --> 00:59:00.240
This is his son. Lerotholi Thoriso II.

558
00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:01.360
We call him Thor.

559
00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:12.240
Listen. I've met him.

560
00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:14.080
You're the same height.

561
00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:15.920
You even have the same swagger.

562
00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:20.120
If we use some pillows
to give you a tummy. then add a cap

563
00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:23.040
-and sunglasses. That's you--
-And then?

564
00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:24.520
Thor took control.

565
00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:27.400
of our country's only gold mine.

566
00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:30.240
Promised to share
the wealth with the people.

567
00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:32.800
Instead. he brings
the raw gold to South Africa.

568
00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:34.000
for his own enrichment.

569
00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:36.960
The thief comes to steal and destroy.

570
00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:39.840
Our plan is perfect. We will succeed.

571
01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:05.880
So how long have you guys been thieves?

572
01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:11.600
We're not thieves. we're activists.

573
01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:17.160
My father started
a resistance against the dictator.

574
01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:20.280
We left Lesotho after they murdered him.

575
01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:24.280
One day. I will avenge my dead husband.

576
01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:29.600
Our mother is the
best gold coin forger in all of Africa.

577
01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:33.560
She taught us
the three most important things in life.

578
01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:38.000
Number one. take from the fat.

579
01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:42.800
Number two.

580
01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:46.400
Party like a rockstar.

581
01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:49.080
-Yes. yes. yes.
-Oh yes!

582
01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:51.680
-Number three.
-Yes.

583
01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:56.160
-Give back.
-Give back.

584
01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:00.360
You've seen our sacred space.

585
01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:03.200
don't disappoint me.

586
01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:15.680
Jesus.

587
01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:38.160
My brothers give their share to

588
01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:40.640
NGOs. orphanages.

589
01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:42.280
And...

590
01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:46.200
this is my way of giving. Let's go.

591
01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.200
This one is for you.

592
01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:38.440
So tell me honestly.

593
01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:41.120
You're stealing this dictator's gold?

594
01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.200
Last year he brought in over a ton.

595
01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:45.240
And you…

596
01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:46.720
can handle that?

597
01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:47.720
I don't have to.

598
01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.880
They bring it to the Joburg Gold Refinery.

599
01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:55.520
They turn it
into gold bars worth 500 million.

600
01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:58.240
That's what we want.

601
01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:00.560
Jozi Gold.

602
01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:03.480
You do know no one has ever
broken into that place.

603
01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:11.920
We're going to take that gold.

604
01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:15.400
Return it to the people of Lesotho.

605
01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:27.160
So this is where you play now?

606
01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:30.760
Not here!

607
01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:32.560
Come.

608
01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:40.000
Listen to me.

609
01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:42.080
This gang.

610
01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:45.840
steals gold. turns it into Krugerrands.

611
01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:47.240
then gives them away.

612
01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:49.640
They live in a scrapyard.

613
01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:50.840
These people are thieves.

614
01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.400
No. man. Bullshit!

615
01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:53.880
They're making a difference.

616
01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:57.280
When last did we make an impact?

617
01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:04.800
Listen.

618
01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:06.880
The home we grew up in.

619
01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:08.320
is in trouble.

620
01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:13.280
it will be forced to close in six months.

621
01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:17.360
I want to buy them a new home.

622
01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:20.360
That's going to cost a lot.

623
01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:22.320
Okay. sure. This gang.

624
01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:26.560
is planning the job of all jobs.

625
01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:29.080
The mother of all heists.

626
01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:31.240
Dude. dude.

627
01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:33.680
Help me.

628
01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:35.200
so I can help them.

629
01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:37.520
Help the home that raised us.

630
01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:44.400
Just do one thing.

631
01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:48.480
Keep the Boers away.

632
01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:02.520
Let's go.

633
01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.160
Let's go. let's go.

634
01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:08.000
Give me this one.

635
01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.400
What if he gets caught?

636
01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:14.920
Won't he snitch on you?

637
01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:19.280
He's my brother. We've come a long way.

638
01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:21.520
He wouldn't do that to me.

639
01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:28.360
Look.

640
01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:31.320
I want you to promise me one thing.

641
01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:35.120
When our kids get older.

642
01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:39.800
I don't want Chili to be their role model.

643
01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:42.600
I want that person to be you.

644
01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:50.840
Come in.

645
01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:56.840
There's someone I want you to meet.

646
01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:58.120
He has inside contacts at the refinery.

647
01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:00.760
They know when
the gold is coming from Lesotho.

648
01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:02.520
Yeah. sure.

649
01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:04.080
We need that man.

650
01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:13.480
Thug!

651
01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:44.440
Hey man!

652
01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:55.080
-What the hell?
-That bastard ripped me off 400 grand!

653
01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:56.600
Sold me fake gold.

654
01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:58.880
-He's a cop!
-I was a cop!

655
01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:00.160
Was a cop!

656
01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:02.080
You can't trust him.

657
01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:03.920
-Let me finish him!
-Chili! Chili!

658
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.440
-Chili. listen for a second.
-Let me finish him!

659
01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:09.160
Listen. there's no job without him.

660
01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:11.400
He knows when the gold is coming.

661
01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:13.360
Chili. Chili!

662
01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:15.520
We need him. okay?

663
01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:17.960
Where is my hyena?

664
01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:21.000
-What?
-Chili.

665
01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:22.520
I'm not going to tell you anything.

666
01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:24.920
until Jonga

667
01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:27.360
is brought back here.

668
01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:53.600
Thank you. brother.

669
01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:55.960
So what now?

670
01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:58.600
You're working with the Hyena Man?

671
01:09:58.680 --> 01:09:59.640
Fuck. no.

672
01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:02.040
-It's not like that.
-Then what?

673
01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:12.240
Jozi Gold Refinery.

674
01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:17.120
Joburg gold?

675
01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:20.280
Corrupt dictators take their gold.

676
01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:23.480
launder it there. back door.

677
01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:28.760
Conflict gold stolen from their own people.

678
01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:33.320
The gang wants to give it back.

679
01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:35.840
That's their impact.

680
01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:53.400
And this?

681
01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:56.320
Tranquillizer gun.

682
01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:57.440
You're going to need it.

683
01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:56.880
Well done. Lieutenant.

684
01:11:58.600 --> 01:11:59.440
When?

685
01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:01.000
When?

686
01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:10.520
Shoes. you find out.

687
01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:19.760
On the day
they refine the gold. he stays here.

688
01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:21.800
Gold Reef City Hotel and Casino.

689
01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:23.240
That's where we make the swap.

690
01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:25.720
Then we return to the refinery.
Get "your" gold.

691
01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:26.720
jump on their plane.

692
01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:27.920
fly to Lesotho.

693
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.120
On the dictator's plane?

694
01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:31.680
Do you have a better idea?

695
01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:00.160
We must be invisible.

696
01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.320
They won't see us coming.

697
01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:03.440
I got you.

698
01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:16.720
Listen here.

699
01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:18.640
Don't you dare mess with me.

700
01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:21.000
Do you hear me? I owe you nothing.

701
01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:24.080
You would be rotting in jail.

702
01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:28.040
but I helped you.

703
01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:50.560
Get out of my face.

704
01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:51.680
You disgust me.

705
01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:56.840
You don't know me.
You don't know what I'm capable of.

706
01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:12.240
Come. come. come! We have no time.

707
01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:13.800
Let's go!

708
01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:17.000
All right men. let's go!

709
01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:31.200
It's time.

710
01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:21.760
There we go.

711
01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.640
The gold is on the move. Let's go.

712
01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:41.560
Copy that. Captain.

713
01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:57.120
-Gert and I are on the target's ass.
-Roger. Major.

714
01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:07.520
The dictator is leaving the Refinery.

715
01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:08.640
Must we follow?

716
01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.200
Lieutenant. find out where they're going.

717
01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:13.800
Major. follow in a single vehicle.

718
01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:49.080
Get us inside so we can see.

719
01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:50.840
Shit. Okay.

720
01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.680
We hope your room meets your expectations.

721
01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:24.200
I managed to hack cameras
in the high roller casino.

722
01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:51.480
There.

723
01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:53.240
There. There.

724
01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:57.800
Pull that up. pull that up.

725
01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:20.800
And now?

726
01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:24.760
Hey. my sister.
You're not allowed. What are you doing?

727
01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:04.160
Van. Fanie. The dictator is on the move.

728
01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:05.680
Major. follow them.

729
01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:29.280
We're following.

730
01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:47.400
Get that finger ready.

731
01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:00.680
Colonel. the limo is back.

732
01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:02.400
Gert. get me a close up of the dictator.

733
01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:03.320
Now!

734
01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:06.640
The Hyena Man is my informant.

735
01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:08.800
Exactly.

736
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.800
As we speak
the plane has already been taken.

737
01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:37.280
My men have pounced.

738
01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:49.960
When that Chili. like a complacent fool.

739
01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:51.640
gets on that plane.

740
01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:52.680
I'll grab him.

741
01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:54.400
Take him.

742
01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:03.520
I want to travel with my gold.

743
01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:12.760
Fuck that.

744
01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:26.920
They're leaving the refinery.
We're right behind them.

745
01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:48.440
If you behave yourselves.

746
01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:52.240
I might give you guys a piece.

747
01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:50.400
He's turning! He's turning!

748
01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:52.600
My dog! My dog!

749
01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:54.640
Go. go. go. go!

750
01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:03.760
The van is changing direction.

751
01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:05.280
It's not going to the airport. over.

752
01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:23.800
Captain!

753
01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:27.200
Get off
that fucking plane and chase the gold!

754
01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:28.200
Yes. Brigadier.

755
01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:54.960
The refinery armored vehicle
has entered a warehouse.

756
01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:19.720
CBD. Carr Street. Over.

757
01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:23.200
Fanie. van. We're at the warehouse.
What do we do now?

758
01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:24.240
The door is locked.

759
01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:49.920
Let's go.

760
01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:38.240
Stop. stop!

761
01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:39.880
Stop. stop!

762
01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:43.120
What the hell?

763
01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:45.200
Colonel. Colonel. we're in shit.

764
01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:47.520
We're being attacked. Sir. sir!

765
01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:51.320
-No man!
-Shut up!

766
01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:54.160
Shut up!

767
01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:01.320
Don't do this. Van Zyl...

768
01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:03.720
Don't! Moshoeshoe...

769
01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:05.400
Are you siding with the Whites?

770
01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:06.560
Do they have you on a leash?

771
01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:09.120
Keys! Back pocket.

772
01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:17.160
Go. go. go. go!

773
01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:21.360
I'm hit! Fuck. I'm hit!

774
01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:23.840
Damn it! Get the hell up!

775
01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:46.120
Now!

776
01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:21.080
Oh. shit! Damnit!

777
01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:27.760
Drive!

778
01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:28.880
Start the car!

779
01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:32.400
Follow them!

780
01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:37.040
-Lourens!
-Let's get out of here.

781
01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:40.720
Let's go! Move!

782
01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:42.320
-Release us.
-Uncuff us!

783
01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:47.280
The Jeep and the refinery armored vehicle

784
01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:50.400
are exiting
the warehouse onto Carr street.

785
01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:52.720
Come rain. come shine
or thunderstorms.

786
01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:54.240
bring me that gold! Understood?

787
01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:56.520
-Yes. Ma'am.
-It's time! Attack!

788
01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:07.640
Listen.

789
01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:11.440
My children.

790
01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:14.280
Don't forget why we're doing this.

791
01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:21.520
Let's go.

792
01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:44.480
The border.

793
01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.080
Open!

794
01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:09.440
The gold is not here.

795
01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:30.880
Those dogs are gone.

796
01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:34.480
You fucking assholes!

797
01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:37.760
Fuck!

798
01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:15.960
Balaclavas. Balaclavas.

799
01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:17.320
Balaclavas.

800
01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:19.080
-Show me the bloody gold.
-Relax. boy!

801
01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:20.400
-Show me the gold.
-Relax.

802
01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:21.640
Show me the bloody gold!

803
01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:27.560
Show me the bloody gold.

804
01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:44.920
This is not real gold.

805
01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:48.400
What the hell is this?

806
01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:51.240
It's iron pyrite.

807
01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:52.920
Fool's gold!

808
01:32:58.320 --> 01:32:59.720
The Hyena Man.

809
01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:02.760
Where is he?

810
01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:05.120
Where is he?

811
01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:07.840
How should we know?
He could be anywhere right now.

812
01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:14.760
He's not going anywhere without his hyena.

813
01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:16.920
He's married to the damn thing. Let's go.

814
01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:18.720
-Where?
-I know where he is.

815
01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:20.000
Don't make me shoot!

816
01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:21.080
Then shoot!

817
01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:41.520
What happened to him?

818
01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:46.480
It's the Brigadier.

819
01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:03.440
Bastards!

820
01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:52.560
Mother?

821
01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:54.320
Mother? Mother?

822
01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:01.000
Are you okay. sir?

823
01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:29.080
Hey. man.

824
01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:31.200
What are you doing with that?

825
01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:38.600
Let's finish this.

826
01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:42.280
Let's finish this.

827
01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:47.280
No. I'm not getting involved.

828
01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:49.800
Do what you want to do.

829
01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:52.760
I'm staying right here with the gold.

830
01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:28.480
Jonga. it's feeding time.

831
01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:30.800
Go!

832
01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:31.960
You missed. asshole!

833
01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:33.480
Come out!

834
01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:46.080
Softly. Softly.

835
01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.120
Wow. Donga.

836
01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:24.440
Don't even think about it.

837
01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:40.520
You see?

838
01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:43.240
This is what real gold feels like.

839
01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:53.640
Help me!

840
01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:11.920
This is what it feels like. To be crushed.

841
01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:15.160
Like those kids who died in your mines.

842
01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.760
-Nandi. It's over.
-Fuck.

843
01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:47.520
You're famous…

844
01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:51.480
for not shooting.

845
01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:00.600
Help me!

846
01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:54.440
Where is he?

847
01:42:56.560 --> 01:42:57.480
Where is he?!

848
01:42:57.560 --> 01:42:58.760
I killed him.

849
01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:01.640
I killed him.

850
01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:16.280
No. Shoes.

851
01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:49.400
Go.

852
01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:02.320
Go!

853
01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:04.080
Go! Go!

854
01:44:04.680 --> 01:44:05.720
Chili. you're not coming with us?

855
01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:08.520
I owe this guy.

856
01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:10.960
Go!

857
01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:18.400
You're full of shit.

858
01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:43.200
My dog.

859
01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:45.440
My dog.

860
01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:05.960
You owe me what?

861
01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:10.720
When this goes to court.

862
01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:14.000
you'll need backup.

863
01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:22.360
Van Zyl knows what you did.

864
01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:25.880
If you carry on like this.
you're going to end up in jail.

865
01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:35.560
We made an impact today.

866
01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:39.000
Today. we made an impact.

867
01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:33.000
Shoes. Shoes!

868
01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:34.200
Look at my new style.

869
01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:01.080
Salute. soldiers!

870
01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:02.000
Salute!

871
01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:28.240
Donga.

872
01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:30.480
Yes. my Chili.

873
01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:32.760
Listen. man.

874
01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:37.280
Me and my girls are planning.

875
01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:40.720
to disappear. Breakout.

876
01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:43.920
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

877
01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:48.200
Are you in?

878
01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:51.600
… Or left behind?

879
01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:55.640
We're out of here.

880
01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:57.480
Right. girls?

881
01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:09.200
