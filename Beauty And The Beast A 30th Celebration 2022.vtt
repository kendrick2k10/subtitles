10
00:01:05.356 --> 00:01:08.693
<i>Once upon a time</i>
<i>in a faraway land.</i>

11
00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:11.654
<i>a young prince lived</i>
<i>in a shining castle.</i>

12
00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:15.575
<i>Although he had everything</i>
<i>his heart desired.</i>

13
00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:20.580
<i>the prince was spoiled. selfish.</i>
<i>and unkind.</i>

14
00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:23.833
<i>But then. one winter's night.</i>

15
00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:26.377
<i>an old beggar woman came</i>
<i>to the castle</i>

16
00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:29.506
<i>and offered him a single rose</i>

17
00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:32.634
<i>in return for shelter</i>
<i>from the bitter cold.</i>

18
00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:35.386
<i>Repulsed by</i>
<i>her haggard appearance.</i>

19
00:01:35.804 --> 00:01:40.183
<i>the prince sneered at the gift</i>
<i>and turned the old woman away.</i>

20
00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:44.104
<i>But she warned him</i>
<i>not to be deceived by appearances.</i>

21
00:01:44.187 --> 00:01:47.065
<i>for beauty is found within.</i>

22
00:01:47.315 --> 00:01:49.192
<i>And when</i>
<i>he dismissed her again.</i>

23
00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:52.070
<i>the old woman's ugliness</i>
<i>melted away</i>

24
00:01:52.403 --> 00:01:55.448
<i>to reveal</i>
<i>a beautiful enchantress.</i>

25
00:01:56.199 --> 00:02:00.495
<i>The prince tried to apologize.</i>
<i>but it was too late. for she had seen</i>

26
00:02:00.578 --> 00:02:02.997
<i>that there was no love</i>
<i>in his heart.</i>

27
00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:04.374
<i>And as punishment.</i>

28
00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:06.960
<i>she transformed him</i>
<i>into a hideous beast</i>

29
00:02:07.043 --> 00:02:11.881
<i>and placed a powerful spell on the castle</i>
<i>and all who lived there.</i>

30
00:02:13.007 --> 00:02:15.176
<i>Ashamed of his monstrous form.</i>

31
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.681
<i>the Beast concealed himself</i>
<i>inside his castle with a magic mirror</i>

32
00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:22.517
<i>as his only window</i>
<i>to the outside world.</i>

33
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.898
<i>The rose she had offered</i>
<i>was truly an enchanted rose.</i>

34
00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:31.818
<i>which would bloom</i>
<i>until his 21st year.</i>

35
00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.574
<i>If he could learn to love another</i>
<i>and earn her love in return</i>

36
00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:40.160
<i>by the time</i>
<i>the last petal fell.</i>

37
00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:43.037
<i>then the spell</i>
<i>would be broken.</i>

38
00:02:44.038 --> 00:02:49.711
<i>If not. he would be doomed</i>
<i>to remain a beast for all time.</i>

39
00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:52.922
<i>As the years passed.</i>

40
00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:57.844
<i>he fell into despair</i>
<i>and lost all hope.</i>

41
00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:03.224
<i>for who could ever learn</i>
<i>to love a beast?</i>

42
00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:34.672
Welcome. everyone.
to the 30th anniversary celebration

43
00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:41.512
of Walt Disney Animation Studios'
Oscar-winning. animated masterpiece.

44
00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:44.432
<i>Beauty and the Beast.</i>

45
00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:47.185
You are in
for such a special treat

46
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.397
as we present the animated movie
we all know and love

47
00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:55.777
with the musical numbers
reimagined

48
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.239
as live-action spectacles.

49
00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:05.411
And for the Disney fan in all of us.
we are going to have

50
00:04:05.536 --> 00:04:08.831
some rare looks
behind the curtain.

51
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.835
showing you just how
this classic film came to be

52
00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:16.297
from right here
on the Disney Studios backlot.

53
00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:20.885
where the inspiration first struck
to create this landmark film.

54
00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:23.179
one that has brought magic
into the lives

55
00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:26.349
of countless people
all around the globe.

56
00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:30.144
And that legacy began
on this very ground

57
00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:34.524
with an artist. an idea.
and a pencil.

58
00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:06.597
<i>Little town. it's a quiet village</i>

59
00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:11.477
<i>Every day like the one before</i>

60
00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:16.482
<i>Little town full of little people</i>

61
00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:21.654
<i>Waking up to say...</i>

62
00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:23.823
<i>-Bonjour.</i>
<i>-Bonjour.</i>

63
00:05:23.906 --> 00:05:25.616
<i>-Bonjour.</i>
<i>-Bonjour.</i>

64
00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:29.662
<i>There goes the baker</i>
<i>With his tray like always</i>

65
00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:32.874
<i>The same old bread and rolls to sell</i>

66
00:05:33.207 --> 00:05:36.627
<i>Every morning. just the same</i>
<i>Since the morning that we came</i>

67
00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:38.546
<i>To this poor provincial town</i>

68
00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:40.381
-Good morning. Belle.
-Good morning. monsieur.

69
00:05:40.631 --> 00:05:42.300
-And where are you off to?
-The book shop.

70
00:05:42.633 --> 00:05:45.928
I just finished the most wonderful story
about a beanstalk and an ogre.

71
00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:49.182
That's nice. Marie. the baguettes!
Hurry up.

72
00:05:50.224 --> 00:05:51.601
<i>Look. there she goes</i>

73
00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:54.103
<i>That girl is strange. no question</i>

74
00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:57.357
<i>Dazed and distracted. can't you tell</i>

75
00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.359
<i>Never part of any crowd</i>

76
00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:01.194
<i>'Cause her head's up on some cloud</i>

77
00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:05.365
<i>No denying</i>
<i>She's a funny girl that Belle</i>

78
00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:07.325
-Bonjour
<i>-Good day</i>

79
00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:09.118
<i>How is your family</i>

80
00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:10.787
<i>-Bonjour</i>
<i>-Good day.</i>

81
00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:12.747
<i>How is your wife</i>

82
00:06:12.997 --> 00:06:16.376
<i>-I need six eggs</i>
<i>-That's too expensive</i>

83
00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:20.963
<i>There must be more</i>
<i>Than this provincial life</i>

84
00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:22.632
-Oh. Belle.
-Good morning.

85
00:06:22.715 --> 00:06:24.300
I've come to return
the book that I borrowed.

86
00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:26.677
-Finished already?
-Oh. I couldn't put it down.

87
00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:29.389
-Have you got anything new?
-Not since yesterday.

88
00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:32.266
Oh. that's all right.
I'll borrow this one.

89
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.603
-That one? But you've read it twice.
-Well. it's my favorite.

90
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.732
Far-off places. daring sword fights.
magic spells.

91
00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:44.237
-a prince in disguise.
-If you like it all that much. it's yours.

92
00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.072
-But madame...
-I insist.

93
00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:48.825
Well. thank you.
Thank you very much.

94
00:06:50.493 --> 00:06:53.913
<i>Look. there she goes</i>
<i>That girl is so peculiar</i>

95
00:06:53.996 --> 00:06:57.291
<i>I wonder if she's feeling well</i>

96
00:06:57.375 --> 00:06:59.127
<i>With a dreamy. far-off look</i>

97
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.003
<i>And her nose stuck in a book</i>

98
00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:05.299
<i>What a puzzle</i>
<i>To the rest of us is Belle</i>

99
00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:07.844
<i>Oh</i>

100
00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:11.764
<i>Isn't this amazing</i>

101
00:07:11.848 --> 00:07:14.600
<i>It's my favorite part</i>

102
00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:21.607
<i>Because you'll see</i>

103
00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:28.614
<i>Here's where she meets Prince Charming</i>

104
00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:33.161
<i>But she won't discover that it's him</i>

105
00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:38.166
<i>Till chapter three</i>

106
00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:41.919
<i>Now. it's no wonder</i>
<i>That her name means beauty</i>

107
00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:45.047
<i>Her looks have got no parallel</i>

108
00:07:45.339 --> 00:07:48.968
<i>But behind that fair façade</i>
<i>I'm afraid she's rather odd</i>

109
00:07:49.051 --> 00:07:50.720
<i>Very different from the rest of us</i>

110
00:07:50.803 --> 00:07:52.805
<i>She's nothing like the rest of us</i>

111
00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:54.557
<i>Yes. different from the rest of us</i>

112
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.684
<i>Is Belle</i>

113
00:07:58.811 --> 00:08:02.482
Ah! Wow!
You didn't miss a shot. Gaston.

114
00:08:02.648 --> 00:08:04.442
You're the greatest hunter
in the whole world!

115
00:08:04.525 --> 00:08:05.443
I know.

116
00:08:05.526 --> 00:08:07.612
No beast stands a chance
against you...

117
00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:10.364
-or any girl. for that matter.
-That's right. LeFou.

118
00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:12.742
and I've got my sights set
on that one.

119
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.118
The inventor's daughter?

120
00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:17.038
She's the one. the lucky girl
I'm going to marry.

121
00:08:17.121 --> 00:08:18.664
-But she's...
-The most beautiful girl in town!

122
00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:20.583
-I know!
-And that means she's the best.

123
00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:22.168
And don't I deserve the best?

124
00:08:22.251 --> 00:08:24.754
Of course.
I mean. you do. but I mean...

125
00:08:28.716 --> 00:08:32.595
<i>Right from the moment that I met her</i>
<i>Saw her</i>

126
00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:33.888
<i>I said. "She's gorgeous"</i>

127
00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:35.932
<i>-And I fell</i>

128
00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:39.894
<i>Here in town. there's only she</i>
<i>Who is beautiful as me</i>

129
00:08:39.977 --> 00:08:44.190
<i>So I'm making plans</i>
<i>To woo and marry Belle</i>

130
00:08:44.273 --> 00:08:47.860
<i>Look. there he goes</i>
<i>Isn't he dreamy</i>

131
00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:51.405
<i>Monsieur Gaston</i>
<i>Oh. he's so cute</i>

132
00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:54.909
<i>Be still. my heart</i>
<i>I'm hardly breathing</i>

133
00:08:54.992 --> 00:08:58.913
<i>He's such a tall. dark</i>
<i>Strong and handsome brute</i>

134
00:08:58.996 --> 00:08:59.914
-Bonjour.
-Pardon!

135
00:08:59.997 --> 00:09:00.957
-Good day.

136
00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.625
<i>You call this bacon</i>

137
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:03.668
<i>-Some cheese.</i>
<i>-Ten yards.</i>

138
00:09:03.834 --> 00:09:04.877
<i>-One pound.</i>
<i>-Excuse me!</i>

139
00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:06.504
-I'll get the knife
-Please let me through

140
00:09:06.587 --> 00:09:07.713
<i>This bread. it's stale</i>

141
00:09:07.838 --> 00:09:08.881
<i>-This fish</i>
<i>-They smell</i>

142
00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:10.466
<i>-Madame's mistaken</i>
<i>-Well. maybe so</i>

143
00:09:10.591 --> 00:09:13.928
<i>There must be more</i>
<i>Than this provincial life</i>

144
00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:17.473
<i>Just watch</i>
<i>I'm going to make Belle my wife</i>

145
00:09:17.598 --> 00:09:18.724
<i>Look. there she goes</i>

146
00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:21.060
<i>That girl is strange. but special</i>

147
00:09:21.143 --> 00:09:24.397
<i>A most peculiar mademoiselle</i>

148
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.274
<i>It's a pity and a sin</i>

149
00:09:26.357 --> 00:09:27.775
<i>She doesn't quite fit in</i>

150
00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:31.946
<i>'Cause she really is a funny girl</i>
<i>A beauty. but a funny girl</i>

151
00:09:32.029 --> 00:09:36.867
<i>She really is a funny girl</i>

152
00:09:36.951 --> 00:09:40.830
<i>That Belle</i>

153
00:09:40.913 --> 00:09:44.625
<i>That Belle</i>

154
00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:49.046
<i>That Belle</i>

155
00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:03.436
<i>Beauty and the Beast!</i>

156
00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:06.647
I'm a huge <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> fan.

157
00:10:06.772 --> 00:10:09.066
I've been listening to it
since I was a little kid.

158
00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:11.652
My first memory of seeing
<i>Beauty and the Beast.</i>

159
00:10:11.736 --> 00:10:12.820
when it came out. I was ten.

160
00:10:12.945 --> 00:10:15.156
Most stories that touch your heart

161
00:10:15.239 --> 00:10:17.408
<i>when you're young.</i>
<i>you never want it to end.</i>

162
00:10:17.491 --> 00:10:20.411
<i>and that's why another incarnation</i>
<i>is always exciting.</i>

163
00:10:20.953 --> 00:10:21.954
-Ow.

164
00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:25.958
I think it's gonna be really fun. man.
Just look at the cast.

165
00:10:26.083 --> 00:10:27.918
Oh. my gosh.
I love Shania Twain.

166
00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:31.631
-Oh. my... Martin Short.
-H.E.R. is brilliant.

167
00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:34.759
DAVID:<i> What I like most about H.E.R.</i>
<i>is she plays guitar. and she's good.</i>

168
00:10:34.842 --> 00:10:37.803
<i>This is the dream team</i>
<i>to end all dream teams.</i>

169
00:10:37.928 --> 00:10:39.930
It's the party of a lifetime.

170
00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:42.850
It's gonna be really. really special.
I can't wait.

171
00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:58.658
One of my favorite parts
of tonight's celebration

172
00:10:58.866 --> 00:11:03.329
is the chance for all of us
to take a look behind the curtain

173
00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:08.709
and experience <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>
the same way the film's animators did

174
00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:11.295
when they first put pencil
to paper.

175
00:11:11.754 --> 00:11:13.089
So here.

176
00:11:13.714 --> 00:11:15.257
for the very first time.

177
00:11:15.758 --> 00:11:17.927
<i>is a scene</i>
<i>you will be familiar with.</i>

178
00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:22.014
<i>only in a way you have never</i>
<i>experienced it before.</i>

179
00:11:25.976 --> 00:11:27.645
-MAURICE:<i> This is it. Belle!</i>

180
00:11:27.728 --> 00:11:29.397
<i>This time is it!</i>

181
00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:32.316
<i>I'll win first prize</i>
<i>at the fair this year.</i>

182
00:11:33.442 --> 00:11:36.195
<i>Oh. Papa. it works!</i>

183
00:11:36.487 --> 00:11:38.739
<i>-You did it!</i>

184
00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:40.241
<i>I always knew you were a genius!</i>

185
00:11:40.449 --> 00:11:43.494
MAURICE:<i> Well. I don't know</i>
<i>if I'd qualify as a...</i>

186
00:11:43.577 --> 00:11:45.204
-BELLE:<i> You'd better hurry.</i>

187
00:11:45.287 --> 00:11:46.372
<i>It's a long ride to the fair.</i>

188
00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:48.124
<i>Goodbye. Papa! Good luck!</i>

189
00:11:48.207 --> 00:11:51.043
<i>Goodbye. Belle!</i>
<i>Take care while I'm gone!</i>

190
00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:57.258
-I should be there by now.

191
00:11:57.341 --> 00:11:59.719
-Maybe we missed a turn.

192
00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:03.472
I guess I should have taken the...
wait a minute.

193
00:12:04.515 --> 00:12:07.017
Come on. Philippe.
It's a shortcut.

194
00:12:15.109 --> 00:12:17.445
-This can't be right.

195
00:12:17.528 --> 00:12:21.282
Where have you taken us. Philippe?
We better turn around.

196
00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:25.494
Steady.
Oh. no. Philippe!

197
00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:26.787
Oh. no.

198
00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:32.960
-Who's there?

199
00:12:34.503 --> 00:12:35.671
Is someone there?

200
00:12:40.634 --> 00:12:42.136
Show yourself at once!

201
00:12:44.805 --> 00:12:45.723
Oh. dear!

202
00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:49.018
Shoo! Help!

203
00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.145
Philippe. help me!

204
00:12:51.228 --> 00:12:52.688
They're gonna eat me!

205
00:12:58.527 --> 00:12:59.570
Stay!

206
00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:02.531
Oh. my!
Oh. no. no!

207
00:13:09.872 --> 00:13:12.249
Let's all calm down.

208
00:13:12.583 --> 00:13:14.919
Oh. dear. Enough.

209
00:13:17.755 --> 00:13:19.924
Help! Is someone there?

210
00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:31.310
-What?

211
00:13:44.448 --> 00:13:46.909
What is... Oh...

212
00:13:53.082 --> 00:13:54.124
Hello?

213
00:13:57.044 --> 00:13:58.504
Hello?

214
00:13:58.587 --> 00:14:00.798
Poor fellow must have
lost his way in the woods.

215
00:14:00.923 --> 00:14:03.884
Keep quiet.
Maybe he'll go away.

216
00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:06.345
Is someone there?

217
00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:09.849
Not a word. Lumière.
not one word.

218
00:14:10.099 --> 00:14:14.854
I don't mean to intrude.
but I've lost my horse. and...

219
00:14:14.937 --> 00:14:17.231
and I need a place to stay
for the night.

220
00:14:17.314 --> 00:14:20.401
-Oh. Cogsworth. have a heart.
-Shh!

221
00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:24.405
-Ah. ah. ah. ow!
-Oh. of course. monsieur.

222
00:14:24.488 --> 00:14:26.824
-you are welcome here.
-Who said that?

223
00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:29.785
-Over here!
-Where?

224
00:14:30.744 --> 00:14:32.079
-Hello.

225
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:37.793
-How is this accomplished?
-Put me down at once.

226
00:14:38.168 --> 00:14:40.170
Stop that.
Stop that. I say.

227
00:14:40.754 --> 00:14:43.090
Oh. you are soaked
to the bone. monsieur.

228
00:14:43.257 --> 00:14:46.218
-Come. warm yourself by the fire.
-<i>Thank you.</i>

229
00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:48.637
COGSWORTH:<i> No. no. no.</i>

230
00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:50.764
<i>You know what the master</i>
<i>will do if he finds him here.</i>

231
00:14:50.848 --> 00:14:53.225
I demand that you stop
right there.

232
00:14:54.435 --> 00:14:57.938
-Well. hello there. boy.

233
00:15:03.068 --> 00:15:04.737
What service.

234
00:15:04.862 --> 00:15:06.697
-All right...

235
00:15:06.822 --> 00:15:09.199
How would you like
a nice spot of tea. sir?

236
00:15:09.283 --> 00:15:10.701
It'll warm you up in no time.

237
00:15:11.076 --> 00:15:13.996
No. No tea. No tea!

238
00:15:16.582 --> 00:15:19.126
His mustache tickles. Mama!

239
00:15:19.209 --> 00:15:21.587
Oh!
Hello.

240
00:15:25.841 --> 00:15:28.177
-Uh-oh.

241
00:15:36.435 --> 00:15:39.229
-There's a stranger here.

242
00:15:39.313 --> 00:15:41.023
Master. allow me to explain.

243
00:15:41.106 --> 00:15:42.691
The gentleman
was lost in the woods.

244
00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:44.151
-He was cold and wet. so...

245
00:15:47.112 --> 00:15:50.157
Mm. Master. I'd like
to take this moment to say

246
00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:51.951
I was against this
from the start.

247
00:15:52.034 --> 00:15:53.619
It was all his fault.
I tried to stop them.

248
00:15:53.702 --> 00:15:54.912
Would they listen to me?
No. no...

249
00:15:57.957 --> 00:15:58.999
Is that...

250
00:16:00.542 --> 00:16:02.127
-Who are you?

251
00:16:02.211 --> 00:16:03.295
What are you doing here?

252
00:16:03.379 --> 00:16:05.798
I-I-I was lost
in the woods. and...

253
00:16:05.881 --> 00:16:09.301
-You are not welcome here!
-I-I-I'm sorry.

254
00:16:09.385 --> 00:16:12.179
-What are you staring at?
-N-nothing.

255
00:16:12.304 --> 00:16:15.766
So you've come to stare
at the Beast. have you?

256
00:16:15.891 --> 00:16:19.603
Please! I meant no harm!
I-I just needed a place to stay.

257
00:16:19.687 --> 00:16:24.400
-I'll give you a place to stay.
-No. no. please! No. no!

258
00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:41.667
Gaston.
What a pleasant surprise.

259
00:16:41.834 --> 00:16:44.878
Isn't it. though?
I'm just full of surprises.

260
00:16:45.254 --> 00:16:47.214
You know. Belle.
there's not a girl in town

261
00:16:47.297 --> 00:16:49.299
who wouldn't love
to be in your shoes.

262
00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.469
This is the day... hmm...

263
00:16:52.553 --> 00:16:55.180
-Ah. This is the day

264
00:16:55.347 --> 00:16:56.849
your dreams come true.

265
00:16:57.224 --> 00:16:59.852
What do you know
about my dreams. Gaston?

266
00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:02.521
Plenty. Here. picture this.

267
00:17:03.439 --> 00:17:05.149
A rustic hunting lodge.

268
00:17:05.441 --> 00:17:08.027
My latest kill
roasting on the fire.

269
00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:11.655
And my little wife
massaging my feet.

270
00:17:12.197 --> 00:17:14.491
while the little ones play on the floor
with the dogs.

271
00:17:14.575 --> 00:17:16.201
We'll have six or seven.

272
00:17:16.326 --> 00:17:18.328
-Dogs?
-No. Belle.

273
00:17:18.746 --> 00:17:21.040
-Strapping boys. like me.
-Imagine that.

274
00:17:21.415 --> 00:17:22.916
And do you know
who that little wife will be?

275
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.793
-Let me think.
-You. Belle.

276
00:17:25.002 --> 00:17:26.837
Gaston. I'm... I'm...

277
00:17:27.671 --> 00:17:28.589
speechless.

278
00:17:29.089 --> 00:17:30.966
I really don't know
what to say.

279
00:17:31.383 --> 00:17:34.553
-Say you'll marry me.
-I'm very sorry. Gaston. but...

280
00:17:35.596 --> 00:17:38.515
but I just don't deserve you.

281
00:17:38.599 --> 00:17:40.100
-Whoa!

282
00:17:46.106 --> 00:17:49.068
So how'd it go?

283
00:17:49.151 --> 00:17:51.695
I'll have Belle for my wife.

284
00:17:51.987 --> 00:17:54.948
-Make no mistake about that.

285
00:17:56.408 --> 00:17:57.910
-Touchy.

286
00:17:58.035 --> 00:18:00.871
" PLAYING)

287
00:18:02.706 --> 00:18:05.793
Can you imagine?
He asked me to marry him.

288
00:18:06.085 --> 00:18:09.421
Me. the wife
of that boorish. brainless...

289
00:18:09.963 --> 00:18:13.675
<i>Madame Gaston</i>
<i>Can't you just see it</i>

290
00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:17.554
<i>Madame Gaston. his little wife</i>

291
00:18:17.638 --> 00:18:21.141
<i>No. sir. not me. I guarantee it</i>

292
00:18:21.225 --> 00:18:25.437
<i>I want much more</i>
<i>Than this provincial life</i>

293
00:18:39.076 --> 00:18:43.997
<i>I want adventure</i>
<i>In the great wide. somewhere</i>

294
00:18:44.081 --> 00:18:48.085
<i>I want it more than I can tell</i>

295
00:19:56.486 --> 00:19:59.781
<i>And for once. it might be grand</i>

296
00:20:00.073 --> 00:20:04.036
<i>To have someone understand</i>

297
00:20:07.456 --> 00:20:09.541
<i>I want so much more</i>

298
00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:13.337
<i>Than they've got planned</i>

299
00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:34.483
Hello. hello.

300
00:20:34.775 --> 00:20:36.693
Now we are getting
into character. eh?

301
00:20:36.777 --> 00:20:39.321
Besides. they must
fall in love tonight

302
00:20:39.404 --> 00:20:41.240
if we ever expect
to be human again.

303
00:20:41.323 --> 00:20:44.243
I've got my heart set
on marrying Belle.

304
00:20:44.368 --> 00:20:46.203
-Philippe!

305
00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:48.747
-What are you doing here? Where's...

306
00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:49.957
Where's Papa?

307
00:20:50.332 --> 00:20:52.626
Where is he. Philippe?
What happened?

308
00:20:53.001 --> 00:20:55.629
Oh. we have to find him.
You have to take me to him.

309
00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:11.520
What is this place?

310
00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.649
Philippe. please. Steady.

311
00:21:17.609 --> 00:21:18.652
Steady.

312
00:21:22.197 --> 00:21:23.448
<i>Papa...</i>

313
00:21:26.159 --> 00:21:27.160
Hello?

314
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:31.123
Is anyone here?

315
00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.960
Papa. are you here?

316
00:21:36.795 --> 00:21:38.005
Did you see that?

317
00:21:38.088 --> 00:21:41.049
-It's a girl!
-Yes. I can see it's a girl.

318
00:21:41.383 --> 00:21:43.176
But don't you see?
She's the one!

319
00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:45.721
The girl we've been waiting for.
She's come to break the spell.

320
00:21:45.804 --> 00:21:47.931
Wait a minute.
Wait just a minute.

321
00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:51.059
Didn't you invite the last guest in?
And you-know-who was furious.

322
00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:52.728
Why are you getting
so wound up?

323
00:21:52.894 --> 00:21:55.439
You're the one who keeps saying.
"Oh. all this waiting is making me

324
00:21:55.564 --> 00:21:57.941
go cuckoo. cuckoo."

325
00:21:58.608 --> 00:21:59.735
Clock jokes?

326
00:22:00.694 --> 00:22:02.738
Really. Lumière? You must have

327
00:22:02.821 --> 00:22:04.656
burned the candle at both ends.
coming up with those.

328
00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:06.658
Come on. The clock is ticking.

329
00:22:06.908 --> 00:22:09.536
Oh. that's clever.

330
00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:11.038
My. you're a thinker.

331
00:22:11.538 --> 00:22:13.332
I would never have thought
you could do that.

332
00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.047
Papa?

333
00:22:20.714 --> 00:22:22.215
Belle?

334
00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:27.012
Oh. you must leave here at once.
Now. go before he finds you.

335
00:22:27.095 --> 00:22:30.432
-Who?
-What are you doing here?

336
00:22:30.766 --> 00:22:33.310
-Run. Belle.
-I've come for my father.

337
00:22:33.685 --> 00:22:35.270
-Please let him out.

338
00:22:35.354 --> 00:22:36.772
Can't you see he's sick?

339
00:22:36.855 --> 00:22:39.149
Then he shouldn't have
trespassed here.

340
00:22:39.358 --> 00:22:42.527
There's nothing you can do.
He's my prisoner.

341
00:22:42.611 --> 00:22:44.446
There must be some way I can...

342
00:22:45.405 --> 00:22:46.615
-Wait.

343
00:22:47.741 --> 00:22:48.825
Take me instead.

344
00:22:49.618 --> 00:22:52.329
You... would take his place?

345
00:22:52.579 --> 00:22:55.332
Belle. no.
You don't know what you're doing.

346
00:22:56.041 --> 00:22:57.584
If I agree.

347
00:22:58.627 --> 00:23:02.255
you must promise to stay here
forever.

348
00:23:04.216 --> 00:23:05.759
Come into the light.

349
00:23:16.686 --> 00:23:19.231
Belle. I won't let you do this.

350
00:23:24.194 --> 00:23:25.362
You have my word.

351
00:23:26.196 --> 00:23:27.364
Done.

352
00:23:28.407 --> 00:23:29.324
No. Belle!

353
00:23:34.246 --> 00:23:36.873
No. please spare my daughter.
Please!

354
00:23:36.957 --> 00:23:38.625
She's no longer your concern.

355
00:23:38.792 --> 00:23:40.460
-Take him to the village.

356
00:23:40.544 --> 00:23:43.046
Let me out!
Please let me out!

357
00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:46.174
Let me out. please!

358
00:23:46.758 --> 00:23:47.843
Please!

359
00:23:49.136 --> 00:23:51.138
You didn't even let me
say goodbye.

360
00:23:51.471 --> 00:23:53.140
I'll never see him again.

361
00:23:53.223 --> 00:23:55.934
And I didn't get
to say goodbye.

362
00:23:57.394 --> 00:24:00.439
-I'll show you to your room.
-My room?

363
00:24:01.148 --> 00:24:02.232
But I thought...

364
00:24:02.482 --> 00:24:04.526
You wanna...
you wanna stay in the tower?

365
00:24:04.609 --> 00:24:06.111
-No.
-Then follow me.

366
00:24:18.665 --> 00:24:20.375
Say something to her.

367
00:24:20.625 --> 00:24:23.003
Huh? Oh. I...

368
00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.338
hope you like it here.

369
00:24:27.716 --> 00:24:30.510
The castle is your home now.
so you can go anywhere you like

370
00:24:30.635 --> 00:24:32.137
except the west wing.

371
00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:34.264
-What's in the west...
-It's forbidden!

372
00:24:41.605 --> 00:24:42.939
Now. if you need anything.

373
00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.066
my servants will attend you.

374
00:24:45.192 --> 00:24:46.568
Dinner.
Invite her to dinner.

375
00:24:48.069 --> 00:24:50.113
You will join me for dinner.

376
00:24:50.363 --> 00:24:51.364
That's not a request!

377
00:25:17.891 --> 00:25:19.267
Who does she think she is?

378
00:25:19.518 --> 00:25:21.394
That girl has tangled
with the wrong man!

379
00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:25.482
-No one says no to Gaston.
-Darn right.

380
00:25:25.941 --> 00:25:30.320
Dismissed. rejected.
publicly humiliated!

381
00:25:30.654 --> 00:25:33.114
-It's more than I can bear.
-More beer?

382
00:25:33.198 --> 00:25:35.158
What for? Nothing helps.

383
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:39.663
-I'm disgraced.
-Who. you? Never!

384
00:25:39.913 --> 00:25:42.499
Gaston. you gotta
pull yourself together.

385
00:25:42.582 --> 00:25:44.501
<i>-Gosh. it disturbs me</i>

386
00:25:44.584 --> 00:25:46.002
<i>To see you. Gaston</i>

387
00:25:46.127 --> 00:25:48.505
<i>Looking so down in the dumps</i>

388
00:25:48.755 --> 00:25:50.924
-<i>Every guy here'd love</i>

389
00:25:51.132 --> 00:25:55.178
<i>To be you. Gaston.</i>
<i>even when taking your lumps</i>

390
00:25:55.804 --> 00:25:58.723
<i>There's no man in town</i>
<i>As admired as you</i>

391
00:25:58.932 --> 00:26:01.393
<i>You're everyone's favorite guy</i>

392
00:26:02.435 --> 00:26:05.480
<i>Everyone's awed and inspired by you</i>

393
00:26:05.814 --> 00:26:09.234
<i>And it's not very hard</i>

394
00:26:09.317 --> 00:26:12.696
<i>To see why</i>

395
00:26:14.531 --> 00:26:19.119
<i>-No one's slick as Gaston</i>

396
00:26:19.202 --> 00:26:20.620
<i>No one's quick as Gaston</i>

397
00:26:20.745 --> 00:26:23.873
<i>No one's neck's as incredibly</i>
<i>Thick as Gaston's</i>

398
00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:27.627
<i>For there's no man in town</i>
<i>Half as manly... </i>

399
00:26:27.794 --> 00:26:30.422
<i>Perfect. a pure paragon</i>

400
00:26:30.547 --> 00:26:33.675
<i>You can ask any Tom. Dick. or Stanley</i>

401
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:37.804
<i>And they'll tell you whose team</i>
<i>They prefer to be on</i>

402
00:26:39.347 --> 00:26:43.768
<i>No one's big like Gaston</i>

403
00:26:43.852 --> 00:26:45.353
<i>A kingpin like Gaston</i>

404
00:26:45.562 --> 00:26:48.189
<i>No one's got a swell cleft</i>
<i>In his chin like Gaston</i>

405
00:26:48.648 --> 00:26:52.569
<i>As a specimen. yes.</i>
<i>I'm intimidating</i>

406
00:26:52.986 --> 00:26:55.488
<i>My what a guy that Gaston</i>

407
00:26:55.655 --> 00:26:58.908
<i>Give five hurrahs. give 12 hip-hips</i>

408
00:26:58.992 --> 00:27:00.660
<i>Gaston is the best</i>

409
00:27:00.744 --> 00:27:03.622
<i>-And the rest is all drips</i>
-Yeah. Oh.

410
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:08.752
ALL:
<i>No one fights like Gaston</i>

411
00:27:08.835 --> 00:27:10.462
<i>Douses lights like Gaston</i>

412
00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:14.174
<i>In a wrestling match</i>
<i>Nobody fights like Gaston</i>

413
00:27:14.257 --> 00:27:17.218
<i>For there's no one as burly and brawny</i>

414
00:27:17.302 --> 00:27:19.929
<i>As you see I've got biceps to spare</i>

415
00:27:20.639 --> 00:27:23.350
<i>Not a bit of him's scraggly or scrawny</i>

416
00:27:23.433 --> 00:27:24.392
That's right!

417
00:27:24.559 --> 00:27:27.646
<i>And every last inch of me's</i>
<i>Covered with hair</i>

418
00:27:27.729 --> 00:27:30.815
<i>No one hits like Gaston</i>
<i>Matches wits like Gaston</i>

419
00:27:30.899 --> 00:27:34.027
<i>In a spitting match.</i>
<i>Nobody spits like Gaston</i>

420
00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:37.530
<i>I'm especially good at expectorating</i>

421
00:27:37.739 --> 00:27:40.825
-Ptooey!
-ALL:<i> Ten points for Gaston</i>

422
00:27:41.076 --> 00:27:43.912
<i>When I was a lad.</i>
<i>I ate four dozen eggs</i>

423
00:27:44.037 --> 00:27:46.706
<i>Every morning to help me get large</i>

424
00:27:47.749 --> 00:27:50.585
<i>And now that I'm grown</i>
<i>I eat five dozen eggs</i>

425
00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:57.926
<i>So I'm roughly the size</i>
<i>Of a barge</i>

426
00:28:31.209 --> 00:28:34.838
<i>No one shoots like Gaston</i>

427
00:28:35.088 --> 00:28:36.339
-No one!
-<i>Makes those beauts</i>

428
00:28:36.423 --> 00:28:38.508
<i>-Like Gaston</i>
<i>-Then goes tromping around</i>

429
00:28:38.675 --> 00:28:40.427
<i>Wearing boots like Gaston</i>

430
00:28:40.552 --> 00:28:44.472
<i>I use antlers</i>
<i>In all of my decorating</i>

431
00:28:44.556 --> 00:28:46.725
<i>My what a guy</i>

432
00:28:47.016 --> 00:28:52.981
<i>Gaston</i>

433
00:29:00.029 --> 00:29:03.825
Help! Someone help me!
He's got her.

434
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:06.077
He's got her locked
in a dungeon.

435
00:29:06.327 --> 00:29:08.705
Oh. we must go.
Not a minute to lose!

436
00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:10.582
Whoa. whoa.
Slow down. Maurice.

437
00:29:10.665 --> 00:29:12.917
-Who's got Belle locked in a dungeon?
-A beast!

438
00:29:13.334 --> 00:29:16.296
A horrible. monstrous beast!

439
00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:21.509
My daughter's life is in danger.
Why do you laugh?

440
00:29:23.178 --> 00:29:24.679
The Beast is real!

441
00:29:25.263 --> 00:29:26.473
Will no one help me?

442
00:29:26.556 --> 00:29:28.892
All right. old man.
We'll help you out.

443
00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.811
Oh. you will?
Oh. thank you. Oh. Thank you.

444
00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:34.189
Thank you.

445
00:29:34.272 --> 00:29:36.524
-Crazy old Maurice.

446
00:29:36.608 --> 00:29:38.318
He's always good for a laugh.

447
00:29:38.568 --> 00:29:41.154
Crazy old Maurice. hmm?

448
00:29:41.404 --> 00:29:43.156
Crazy old Maurice.

449
00:29:43.239 --> 00:29:44.949
Hmm...

450
00:29:48.578 --> 00:29:51.164
<i>-LeFou. I'm afraid I've been thinking</i>

451
00:29:51.456 --> 00:29:53.625
A dangerous pastime.

452
00:29:53.708 --> 00:29:55.001
-I know.

453
00:29:55.084 --> 00:29:58.129
<i>But that wacky old coot is Belle's father</i>

454
00:29:58.713 --> 00:30:01.299
<i>And his sanity's only so-so</i>

455
00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.886
<i>Now the wheels in my head</i>
<i>Have been turning</i>

456
00:30:05.136 --> 00:30:08.139
<i>-Since I looked at that loony old man</i>

457
00:30:08.306 --> 00:30:11.684
<i>See. I promised myself</i>
<i>I'd be married to Belle</i>

458
00:30:11.851 --> 00:30:15.855
<i>And right now</i>
<i>I'm evolving a plan</i>

459
00:30:17.565 --> 00:30:18.566
-If I...
-Yes?

460
00:30:18.691 --> 00:30:19.692
-Then we...
-No. will she?

461
00:30:19.818 --> 00:30:21.569
-Yes.
-Now I get it.

462
00:30:22.028 --> 00:30:24.531
Let's go!

463
00:30:25.532 --> 00:30:29.494
<i>No one plots like Gaston</i>

464
00:30:29.577 --> 00:30:31.204
<i>Takes cheap shots like Gaston</i>

465
00:30:31.287 --> 00:30:34.666
<i>Plans to persecute harmless</i>
<i>Crackpots like Gaston</i>

466
00:30:34.749 --> 00:30:40.505
<i>So his marriage</i>
<i>We soon will be celebrating</i>

467
00:30:40.588 --> 00:30:47.470
<i>My. what a guy. Gaston</i>

468
00:30:54.561 --> 00:30:55.687
Hmm?

469
00:31:10.159 --> 00:31:13.663
There has to be some way
we can cheer up Belle.

470
00:31:14.372 --> 00:31:17.584
-Help her see the bright side.
-I've got it!

471
00:31:19.252 --> 00:31:21.379
Why don't you show her
your little TikTok dance?

472
00:31:21.462 --> 00:31:22.881
That always cheers me up.

473
00:31:23.047 --> 00:31:24.924
It's not a dance.
It's the way I walk.

474
00:31:25.091 --> 00:31:26.926
And tick-tock is the sound
I make when I move.

475
00:31:27.093 --> 00:31:28.094
Ah.

476
00:31:32.181 --> 00:31:34.642
Oh. I'm suddenly happy.

477
00:31:40.315 --> 00:31:42.233
-Who is it?
-MRS. POTTS: Mrs. Potts. dear.

478
00:31:44.444 --> 00:31:45.612
-I thought you might like...

479
00:31:45.695 --> 00:31:47.363
-A spot of tea.
-But you're...

480
00:31:47.614 --> 00:31:50.158
-you're a...
-Oh!

481
00:31:50.283 --> 00:31:52.368
-Careful.
-This is impossible.

482
00:31:52.702 --> 00:31:55.330
I know it is. but here we are.

483
00:31:55.538 --> 00:31:57.916
That was a very brave thing
you did. my dear.

484
00:31:58.124 --> 00:31:59.459
We all think so.

485
00:31:59.584 --> 00:32:03.129
But I've lost my father.
my dreams. everything.

486
00:32:03.296 --> 00:32:04.923
Cheer up. child.

487
00:32:05.465 --> 00:32:09.010
It'll turn out all right in the end.
You'll see.

488
00:32:09.385 --> 00:32:11.220
Oh. listen to me. jabbering on

489
00:32:11.304 --> 00:32:13.222
while there's a supper
to get on the table.

490
00:32:13.389 --> 00:32:14.307
Chip!

491
00:32:15.433 --> 00:32:16.517
Bye!

492
00:32:16.726 --> 00:32:19.520
What's taking so long?

493
00:32:20.063 --> 00:32:23.441
I told her to come down.
Why isn't she here yet?

494
00:32:23.691 --> 00:32:25.276
Oh. try to be patient. sir.

495
00:32:25.526 --> 00:32:28.863
The girl has lost her father
and her freedom all in one day.

496
00:32:29.155 --> 00:32:31.908
Master. have you thought
that perhaps this girl

497
00:32:31.991 --> 00:32:34.661
-could be the one to break the spell?
-Of course I have!

498
00:32:35.036 --> 00:32:36.955
-I'm not a fool.
-Good.

499
00:32:37.246 --> 00:32:40.792
So you fall in love with her.
she falls in love with you.

500
00:32:40.875 --> 00:32:42.752
and poof. the spell is broken.

501
00:32:42.835 --> 00:32:44.754
We'll be human again
by midnight.

502
00:32:44.837 --> 00:32:47.757
Oh. it's not that easy. Lumière.
These things take time.

503
00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.968
But the rose has already
begun to wilt.

504
00:32:50.051 --> 00:32:51.678
Oh. it's no use.

505
00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:54.138
She's so beautiful. and I'm...

506
00:32:54.889 --> 00:32:55.974
well. look at me!

507
00:32:58.393 --> 00:33:01.104
Oh. you must help her
to see past all that.

508
00:33:01.437 --> 00:33:02.522
I don't know how.

509
00:33:03.564 --> 00:33:06.067
Well. you can start by making yourself
more presentable.

510
00:33:06.317 --> 00:33:08.361
Straighten up.
Try to act like a gentleman.

511
00:33:08.444 --> 00:33:12.156
Ah. yes. When she comes in.
give her a dashing. debonair smile.

512
00:33:12.615 --> 00:33:13.992
Come. come. Show me the smile.

513
00:33:14.742 --> 00:33:19.122
-But don't frighten the poor girl.
-Impress her with your rapier wit.

514
00:33:19.205 --> 00:33:20.289
But be gentle.

515
00:33:20.707 --> 00:33:22.792
-Shower her with compliments.
-MRS. POTTS: But be sincere.

516
00:33:22.875 --> 00:33:24.168
And above all...

517
00:33:24.335 --> 00:33:26.379
You must control your temper.

518
00:33:26.671 --> 00:33:28.589
-Here she is.

519
00:33:30.717 --> 00:33:32.010
Good evening.

520
00:33:33.302 --> 00:33:34.804
Well? Where is she?

521
00:33:35.972 --> 00:33:36.931
What?

522
00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:40.393
<i>But Your Grace. Your Eminence...</i>

523
00:33:41.102 --> 00:33:42.687
<i>let's not be hasty!</i>

524
00:33:45.523 --> 00:33:47.275
I thought I told you
to come down to dinner.

525
00:33:47.442 --> 00:33:48.568
I'm not hungry.

526
00:33:49.569 --> 00:33:52.697
You'll come out. or I'll...
I'll... I'll break down the door!

527
00:33:53.072 --> 00:33:55.575
Master. I could be wrong.
but. uh...

528
00:33:55.658 --> 00:33:59.162
That may not be the best way
to win the girl's affections.

529
00:33:59.328 --> 00:34:02.707
Please. attempt to be a gentleman.

530
00:34:02.915 --> 00:34:06.085
It would give me
great pleasure

531
00:34:07.128 --> 00:34:08.921
if you would join me
for dinner.

532
00:34:09.005 --> 00:34:10.048
We say please.

533
00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:12.508
-Please.
-No. thank you.

534
00:34:12.675 --> 00:34:14.218
You can't stay in there forever.

535
00:34:14.302 --> 00:34:16.220
-Yes. I can.
-Fine!

536
00:34:16.304 --> 00:34:19.599
Then go ahead and starve!

537
00:34:19.766 --> 00:34:21.601
If she doesn't eat with me.

538
00:34:22.143 --> 00:34:23.936
then she doesn't eat at all.

539
00:34:27.231 --> 00:34:28.566
-Oh. dear.

540
00:34:28.691 --> 00:34:30.276
That didn't go very well
at all. did it?

541
00:34:32.487 --> 00:34:35.114
What does she want me to do? Beg?

542
00:34:41.537 --> 00:34:42.830
Show me the girl.

543
00:34:43.581 --> 00:34:46.793
<i>But the master's really not so bad</i>
<i>once you get to know him.</i>

544
00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:49.087
<i>Why don't you give him</i>
<i>a chance?</i>

545
00:34:49.295 --> 00:34:50.922
<i>I don't want to get to know him.</i>

546
00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:53.257
<i>I don't want to have</i>
<i>anything to do with him.</i>

547
00:34:55.968 --> 00:34:57.887
I'm just fooling myself.

548
00:34:58.763 --> 00:35:02.141
She'll never see me as anything
but a monster.

549
00:35:06.938 --> 00:35:07.939
It's hopeless.

550
00:36:37.528 --> 00:36:40.656
The falling petals
of an enchanted rose.

551
00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:43.326
each one a graceful reminder

552
00:36:43.451 --> 00:36:47.288
that love is as fragile
as it is enduring.

553
00:36:47.705 --> 00:36:52.460
as difficult to find
as it is a wonder to hold onto.

554
00:36:53.002 --> 00:36:56.047
That true love can overcome
any obstacles

555
00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:59.300
no matter how impossible
they may seem.

556
00:37:00.009 --> 00:37:03.596
<i>It is this idea that inspired</i>
<i>Walt Disney himself</i>

557
00:37:03.679 --> 00:37:06.766
<i>to want to tell the story</i>
<i>of </i>Beauty and the Beast

558
00:37:06.849 --> 00:37:09.143
<i>as far back as the 1930s.</i>

559
00:37:10.186 --> 00:37:15.024
<i>For decades. Disney artists worked</i>
<i>to adapt this tale as old as time.</i>

560
00:37:15.149 --> 00:37:18.527
<i>yet something was always missing</i>
<i>from these early efforts.</i>

561
00:37:18.945 --> 00:37:23.157
<i>Then. more than 50 years</i>
<i>after inspiration first struck.</i>

562
00:37:23.241 --> 00:37:28.496
<i>a team came together that was just</i>
<i>as special as the fairy tale itself.</i>

563
00:37:28.746 --> 00:37:30.831
<i>Dancing again. we'll be twirling again</i>

564
00:37:30.915 --> 00:37:31.874
-Yeah.
-Want that faster?

565
00:37:31.958 --> 00:37:34.252
-Yeah.
<i>-Composer Alan Menken.</i>

566
00:37:34.418 --> 00:37:35.920
<i>lyricist Howard Ashman.</i>

567
00:37:36.003 --> 00:37:38.381
<i>and the team at Walt Disney</i>
<i>Animation Studios</i>

568
00:37:38.464 --> 00:37:41.217
<i>found the missing spark.</i>

569
00:37:41.509 --> 00:37:46.305
<i>Together with Linda Woolverton.</i>
<i>the first woman ever to write</i>

570
00:37:46.389 --> 00:37:50.017
<i>an animated feature for Disney.</i>
<i>they brought the story to life</i>

571
00:37:50.101 --> 00:37:53.437
<i>not simply through words.</i>
<i>but through music.</i>

572
00:37:53.604 --> 00:37:57.525
<i>and were finally able to deliver</i>
<i>on Walt Disney's dream.</i>

573
00:37:57.817 --> 00:38:00.736
<i>Roy Disney himself wrote</i>
<i>the film's prologue.</i>

574
00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:03.489
<i>Together. they embraced</i>
<i>all the joy</i>

575
00:38:03.572 --> 00:38:06.409
<i>of Belle becoming the hero</i>
<i>of her own story...</i>

576
00:38:06.534 --> 00:38:09.245
I want excitement
and adventure in my life.

577
00:38:09.912 --> 00:38:12.039
And I want someone
to share it with.

578
00:38:12.206 --> 00:38:16.043
<i>And the magic of the Beast</i>
<i>and his enchanted castle.</i>

579
00:38:16.585 --> 00:38:18.379
Beauty and the Beast <i>has become</i>

580
00:38:18.462 --> 00:38:23.050
one of the most beloved
animated classics ever made.

581
00:38:23.592 --> 00:38:27.763
It was even
the first animated film ever

582
00:38:27.847 --> 00:38:31.475
to be nominated for Best Picture
at the Academy Awards.

583
00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:33.811
And to this day.

584
00:38:34.645 --> 00:38:39.233
Walt Disney's original idea
continues to inspire us all.

585
00:38:48.951 --> 00:38:52.204
<i>Come on. Chip. into the cupboard</i>
<i>with your brothers and sisters.</i>

586
00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:56.959
-But I'm not sleepy.
-Yes. you are.

587
00:38:57.084 --> 00:38:58.836
-No. I'm not.

588
00:38:58.919 --> 00:39:01.964
Well. if you ask me.
she was just being stubborn.

589
00:39:02.048 --> 00:39:03.632
After all. he did say "please."

590
00:39:03.716 --> 00:39:06.510
But if the master doesn't learn
to control that temper.

591
00:39:06.594 --> 00:39:08.929
-He'll never break...
-Splendid to see you

592
00:39:09.013 --> 00:39:10.222
out and about. mademoiselle.

593
00:39:10.765 --> 00:39:13.142
I am Cogsworth.
head of the household.

594
00:39:13.225 --> 00:39:15.061
-Ah.

595
00:39:15.603 --> 00:39:18.481
-This is Lumière.
<i>-Enchanté. chérie.</i>

596
00:39:18.814 --> 00:39:22.526
If there's... stop that...
anything we... please... can do

597
00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:24.195
to make your stay
more comfortable...

598
00:39:24.278 --> 00:39:25.279
-Ow!

599
00:39:25.404 --> 00:39:27.573
-I am a little hungry.
-You are?

600
00:39:27.782 --> 00:39:29.367
Hear that? She's hungry.

601
00:39:29.742 --> 00:39:32.495
Stoke the fire. Break out the silver.
Wake the china.

602
00:39:32.828 --> 00:39:35.081
Remember what the master said?

603
00:39:35.247 --> 00:39:38.417
Oh. pish-posh. I'm not about to let
the poor child go hungry.

604
00:39:38.584 --> 00:39:39.877
All right. fine.

605
00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:41.504
Glass of water. crust of bread.
and then...

606
00:39:41.629 --> 00:39:43.964
Cogsworth. I am surprised at you.

607
00:39:44.256 --> 00:39:46.634
She's not a prisoner.
She's our guest.

608
00:39:46.801 --> 00:39:48.761
We must make her feel
welcome here.

609
00:39:48.969 --> 00:39:52.139
-Right this way. mademoiselle.
-Well. keep it down.

610
00:39:52.556 --> 00:39:54.934
If the master finds out about this.
it will be our necks.

611
00:39:55.017 --> 00:39:56.560
Of course. of course.

612
00:39:56.894 --> 00:39:59.772
But what is dinner
without a little music?

613
00:40:00.147 --> 00:40:01.482
-Music?

614
00:40:03.859 --> 00:40:05.820
<i>Ma cheré mademoiselle.</i>

615
00:40:05.903 --> 00:40:08.864
it is with deepest pride
and greatest pleasure

616
00:40:09.031 --> 00:40:11.867
that we welcome you
here tonight.

617
00:40:12.284 --> 00:40:16.122
And now we invite you
to relax and to pull up a chair

618
00:40:16.205 --> 00:40:21.419
as the dining room
proudly presents your dinner.

619
00:40:22.837 --> 00:40:26.715
<i>Be our guest</i>

620
00:40:26.799 --> 00:40:30.136
<i>Be our guest</i>
<i>Put our service to the test</i>

621
00:40:30.344 --> 00:40:34.557
<i>Tie a napkin 'round your neck. chérie</i>
<i>And we'll provide the rest</i>

622
00:40:35.015 --> 00:40:37.518
<i>Soup du jour. hot hors d'oeuvres</i>

623
00:40:37.601 --> 00:40:39.562
<i>Why. we only live to serve</i>

624
00:40:39.645 --> 00:40:41.814
<i>Try the gray stuff. it's delicious</i>

625
00:40:41.897 --> 00:40:43.732
<i>Don't believe me</i>
<i>Ask the dishes</i>

626
00:40:43.899 --> 00:40:48.821
<i>They can sing. they can dance</i>
<i>After all. miss. this is France</i>

627
00:40:48.904 --> 00:40:52.825
<i>And a dinner here is never second best</i>

628
00:40:52.908 --> 00:40:55.161
<i>Go on. unfold your menu</i>

629
00:40:55.244 --> 00:40:58.330
<i>Take a glance</i>
<i>And then you'll be our guest</i>

630
00:40:58.622 --> 00:41:01.417
Oui.<i> our guest. be our guest</i>

631
00:41:01.792 --> 00:41:06.213
<i>Beef ragout. cheese soufflé</i>
<i>Pie and pudding en flambé</i>

632
00:41:06.297 --> 00:41:10.509
<i>We'll prepare and serve with flair</i>
<i>A culinary cabaret</i>

633
00:41:10.593 --> 00:41:14.889
<i>You're alone and you're scared</i>
<i>But the banquet's all prepared</i>

634
00:41:14.972 --> 00:41:19.435
<i>No one's gloomy or complaining</i>
<i>While the flatware is entertaining</i>

635
00:41:19.727 --> 00:41:23.439
<i>We tell jokes. I do tricks</i>
<i>With my fellow candlesticks</i>

636
00:41:23.522 --> 00:41:27.318
<i>And it's all in perfect taste</i>
<i>That you can bet</i>

637
00:41:27.401 --> 00:41:29.403
<i>Come on and lift your glass</i>

638
00:41:29.487 --> 00:41:31.655
<i>You've won your own free pass</i>

639
00:41:31.739 --> 00:41:33.157
<i>To be our guest</i>

640
00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.993
<i>If you're stressed</i>
<i>It's fine dining we suggest</i>

641
00:41:36.118 --> 00:41:39.872
<i>Be our guest</i>
<i>Be our guest. be our guest</i>

642
00:41:41.457 --> 00:41:43.876
<i>Life is so unnerving</i>

643
00:41:44.084 --> 00:41:46.420
<i>For a servant who's not serving</i>

644
00:41:46.545 --> 00:41:50.090
<i>He's not whole without a soul to wait upon</i>

645
00:41:51.342 --> 00:41:55.638
<i>Oh. those good old days</i>
<i>When we were useful</i>

646
00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:59.517
<i>Suddenly those good old days are gone</i>

647
00:42:01.101 --> 00:42:05.356
<i>Ten years we've been rusting</i>
<i>Needing so much more than dusting</i>

648
00:42:05.689 --> 00:42:09.568
<i>Needing exercise</i>
<i>A chance to use our skills</i>

649
00:42:11.111 --> 00:42:15.449
<i>Most days we just lay</i>
<i>Around the castle</i>

650
00:42:15.824 --> 00:42:19.828
<i>Flabby. fat. and lazy</i>
<i>You walked in and oopsie-daisy</i>

651
00:42:20.788 --> 00:42:22.623
<i>Ma cheré mademoiselle.</i>

652
00:42:22.706 --> 00:42:26.168
it is my honor to present
my favorite cup of tea.

653
00:42:26.418 --> 00:42:28.963
the incomparable Mrs. Potts.

654
00:42:29.296 --> 00:42:31.215
<i>It's a guest. it's a guest</i>

655
00:42:31.382 --> 00:42:32.800
<i>Sakes alive and I'll be blessed</i>

656
00:42:33.217 --> 00:42:34.927
<i>Wine's been poured</i>
<i>And thank the Lord</i>

657
00:42:35.094 --> 00:42:36.929
<i>I've had the napkins freshly pressed</i>

<i>With dessert. she'll want tea</i>
<i>And my dear. that's fine with me</i>

659
00:42:40.808 --> 00:42:44.770
<i>While the cups do their soft-shoein'</i>
<i>I'll be bubblin'. I'll be brewin'</i>

660
00:42:44.853 --> 00:42:48.524
<i>I'll get warm. piping hot</i>
<i>Heaven's sakes. is that a spot</i>

661
00:42:48.691 --> 00:42:52.027
<i>Clean it up.</i>
<i>We want the company impressed</i>

662
00:42:52.194 --> 00:42:56.031
<i>We've got a lot to do</i>
<i>Is it one lump or two</i>

663
00:42:56.198 --> 00:42:57.700
<i>For you. our guest</i>

664
00:42:57.783 --> 00:42:59.493

<i>It's been years since we've had</i>
<i>Anybody here and we're obsessed</i>

668
00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:11.463
<i>With your meal. with your ease</i>
<i>Yes. indeed we aim to please</i>

669
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:14.466
<i>While candlelight's still glowing</i>

670
00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:19.263
<i>Let us help you. we'll keep going</i>

671
00:43:19.346 --> 00:43:22.641
<i>Course by course</i>

672
00:43:23.642 --> 00:43:25.352
<i>One by one</i>

673
00:43:25.894 --> 00:43:28.230
<i>Till you shout. enough. I'm done</i>

674
00:43:28.355 --> 00:43:31.942
<i>Then we'll sing you</i>
<i>Off to sleep as you digest</i>

675
00:43:32.484 --> 00:43:36.238
<i>Tonight you'll prop your feet up</i>
<i>But for now. let's eat up</i>

676
00:43:36.405 --> 00:43:37.615
<i>-Be our guest</i>
<i>-Be our guest</i>

677
00:43:37.823 --> 00:43:39.742
-<i>Be our guest</i>
<i>-Be our guest</i>

678
00:43:39.908 --> 00:43:40.951
<i>Be our guest</i>

679
00:43:41.493 --> 00:43:47.625
<i>Please. be our guest</i>

680
00:43:59.845 --> 00:44:02.306
Bravo.
That was wonderful.

681
00:44:02.473 --> 00:44:05.601
Thank you. mademoiselle.
It was wonderful. Wasn't it. everyone?

682
00:44:07.686 --> 00:44:11.565
Will you look at the time?
Off to bed. off to bed.

683
00:44:12.441 --> 00:44:15.361
I'd like to look around.
Perhaps you'd like to take me?

684
00:44:15.611 --> 00:44:18.822
I'm sure you know everything
there is to know about the castle.

685
00:44:18.989 --> 00:44:20.908
Well. actually. yes. I do.

686
00:44:23.619 --> 00:44:24.995
Right this way.

687
00:44:26.288 --> 00:44:27.623
-As you can see...

688
00:44:27.706 --> 00:44:32.336
The pseudo façade was stripped away
to reveal a minimalist Rococo design.

689
00:44:32.544 --> 00:44:33.837
-Note the unusual...

690
00:44:33.921 --> 00:44:35.297
...inverted vaulted ceilings.

691
00:44:35.464 --> 00:44:39.009
This is yet another example
of the late neoclassic Baroque period.

692
00:44:39.218 --> 00:44:42.638
And as I always say.
if it's not Baroque. don't fix it.

693
00:44:44.723 --> 00:44:46.100
Mm. Uh. where was I?

694
00:44:47.643 --> 00:44:49.561
-As you were.

695
00:44:49.812 --> 00:44:51.939
Now then. if I may draw
your attention

696
00:44:52.022 --> 00:44:54.191
to the flying buttresses
above the...

697
00:44:54.692 --> 00:44:55.943
uh. mademoiselle?

698
00:45:01.782 --> 00:45:04.118
-What's up there?
-Where? There? Oh. nothing.

699
00:45:04.201 --> 00:45:06.328
Absolutely nothing of interest
at all in the west wing.

700
00:45:06.412 --> 00:45:08.497
Dusty. dull. very boring.

701
00:45:09.164 --> 00:45:11.458
Ah. so that's the west wing.

702
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:14.086
-Nice going.

703
00:45:14.169 --> 00:45:17.297
-I wonder what he's hiding up there.
-Hiding?

704
00:45:17.381 --> 00:45:19.216
The...the master
is hiding nothing.

705
00:45:19.341 --> 00:45:20.634
Then it wouldn't be forbidden.

706
00:45:20.718 --> 00:45:23.679
Perhaps. uh. mademoiselle
would like to. uh. uh.

707
00:45:23.762 --> 00:45:25.013
uh. see something else?

708
00:45:25.264 --> 00:45:27.766
We have exquisite tapestries
dating all the way back to...

709
00:45:27.891 --> 00:45:30.144
-Maybe later.
-Uh. the-the gardens?

710
00:45:30.352 --> 00:45:33.480
-Or-or the-the-the library. perhaps?
-You have a library?

711
00:45:33.605 --> 00:45:35.691
Yes! Ye...oh. indeed.

712
00:45:35.774 --> 00:45:37.609
-With books.
-Scads of books.

713
00:45:37.693 --> 00:45:39.820
-Mountains of books.
-Forests of books.

714
00:45:39.903 --> 00:45:41.071
-Cascades.
-Cloudbursts.

715
00:45:41.196 --> 00:45:42.364
-Swamps of books.

716
00:45:42.448 --> 00:45:44.700
More books than you'll ever
be able to read in a lifetime.

717
00:45:44.825 --> 00:45:46.785
Books on every subject
ever studied.

718
00:45:47.077 --> 00:45:49.079
by every author
whoever set pen to paper.

719
00:46:13.979 --> 00:46:15.439
-Oh.

720
00:47:02.277 --> 00:47:05.364
-Why did you come here?
-I...I'm sorry.

721
00:47:05.447 --> 00:47:09.284
-I warned you never to come here.
-I didn't mean any harm.

722
00:47:09.368 --> 00:47:11.995
Do you realize
what you could have done?

723
00:47:12.079 --> 00:47:14.331
-Please. stop.

724
00:47:14.456 --> 00:47:16.667
-Get out!
-No!

725
00:47:18.836 --> 00:47:20.546
Get out!

726
00:47:49.324 --> 00:47:51.493
Okay. Okay.

727
00:47:51.994 --> 00:47:53.036
Okay.

728
00:48:05.757 --> 00:48:07.593
Okay.

729
00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:50.010
You saved me.

730
00:49:19.831 --> 00:49:21.833
Here. now. Oh. don't do that.

731
00:49:25.921 --> 00:49:29.424
-Just hold still.

732
00:49:29.883 --> 00:49:31.510
-That hurts!
-If you'd hold still.

733
00:49:31.635 --> 00:49:32.719
it wouldn't hurt as much.

734
00:49:32.844 --> 00:49:34.888
Well. if you hadn't have run away.
this wouldn't have happened.

735
00:49:35.097 --> 00:49:37.766
If you hadn't frightened me.
I wouldn't have run away.

736
00:49:38.934 --> 00:49:41.395
Well. you shouldn't have been
in the west wing.

737
00:49:41.478 --> 00:49:43.563
Well. you should learn
to control your temper.

738
00:49:47.317 --> 00:49:48.694
Now hold still.

739
00:49:49.152 --> 00:49:52.447
-This might sting a little.
-Hmm?

740
00:49:53.532 --> 00:49:57.619
By the way.
thank you for saving my life.

741
00:50:02.332 --> 00:50:03.583
You're welcome.

742
00:50:07.546 --> 00:50:08.880
GASTON:<i> It's like this.</i>

743
00:50:09.089 --> 00:50:11.717
I've got my heart set
on marrying Belle.

744
00:50:12.009 --> 00:50:14.886
But she needs
a little persuasion.

745
00:50:15.012 --> 00:50:17.889
So you want me to throw
her father into the asylum

746
00:50:17.973 --> 00:50:20.225
<i>unless she agrees</i>
<i>to marry you?</i>

747
00:50:21.101 --> 00:50:23.478
<i>Oh. that is despicable.</i>

748
00:50:23.729 --> 00:50:26.023
<i>I love it.</i>

749
00:50:28.692 --> 00:50:31.695
If no one will help me.
then I'll go back alone.

750
00:50:31.778 --> 00:50:34.823
Yeah. Is that everything?
I don't care what it takes.

751
00:50:34.906 --> 00:50:36.283
I'll find that castle.

752
00:50:36.366 --> 00:50:39.119
and somehow.
I'll get her out of there.

753
00:50:59.723 --> 00:51:02.309
I've never felt this way
about anyone.

754
00:51:04.352 --> 00:51:05.937
I want to do something for her.

755
00:51:07.147 --> 00:51:08.065
But what?

756
00:51:08.231 --> 00:51:09.983
Well. there's the usual things...

757
00:51:10.067 --> 00:51:13.612
flowers. chocolates. promises
you don't intend to keep.

758
00:51:13.695 --> 00:51:17.699
Ah. no. no.
It has to be something very special.

759
00:51:18.033 --> 00:51:20.118
Something that sparks
her interest.

760
00:51:20.285 --> 00:51:21.244
Wait a minute!

761
00:51:23.747 --> 00:51:24.915
Belle...

762
00:51:25.707 --> 00:51:27.667
there's something
I want to show you.

763
00:51:29.878 --> 00:51:32.089
But first.
you have to close your eyes.

764
00:51:34.716 --> 00:51:35.801
It's a surprise.

765
00:51:47.062 --> 00:51:49.606
-Can I open them?
-No. no. Not yet.

766
00:51:50.982 --> 00:51:51.983
Wait here.

767
00:51:57.572 --> 00:51:58.865
Now can I open them?

768
00:51:59.282 --> 00:52:01.785
All right. Now.

769
00:52:10.293 --> 00:52:11.920
I can't believe it.

770
00:52:12.963 --> 00:52:15.006
I've never seen so many books
in all my life.

771
00:52:15.215 --> 00:52:18.426
-You... you like it?
-It's wonderful.

772
00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:19.678
Then it's yours.

773
00:52:20.387 --> 00:52:22.389
Oh. thank you so much.

774
00:52:22.597 --> 00:52:23.890
Would you look at that?

775
00:52:23.974 --> 00:52:25.892
I knew it would work.

776
00:52:25.976 --> 00:52:28.311
-What? What worked?

777
00:52:28.395 --> 00:52:30.438
It's very encouraging.

778
00:52:30.522 --> 00:52:33.150
-Isn't this exciting?
-I didn't see anything.

779
00:52:33.233 --> 00:52:36.278
Come along. Chip.
There's chores to be done in the kitchen.

780
00:52:36.444 --> 00:52:40.198
But what are they talking about?
What's going on? Come on. Mom.

781
00:53:38.381 --> 00:53:42.135
<i>There's something sweet and almost kind</i>

782
00:53:42.219 --> 00:53:45.972
<i>But he was mean and he was</i>
<i>Coarse and unrefined</i>

783
00:53:46.056 --> 00:53:49.226
<i>And now he's dear and so unsure</i>

784
00:53:49.976 --> 00:53:54.105
<i>I wonder why I didn't see it there before</i>

785
00:54:06.868 --> 00:54:10.330
<i>She glanced this way.</i>
<i>I thought I saw</i>

786
00:54:10.914 --> 00:54:14.542
<i>And when we touched</i>
<i>She didn't shudder at my paw</i>

787
00:54:14.668 --> 00:54:16.086
<i>No. it can't be</i>

788
00:54:16.419 --> 00:54:17.963
<i>I'll just ignore</i>

789
00:54:18.588 --> 00:54:22.342
<i>But then she's never looked</i>
<i>At me that way before</i>

790
00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:31.184
<i>New and a bit alarming</i>

791
00:54:31.268 --> 00:54:33.812
<i>Who'd have ever thought</i>

792
00:54:33.895 --> 00:54:39.609
<i>That this could be</i>

793
00:54:40.568 --> 00:54:46.116
<i>True that he's no Prince Charming</i>

794
00:54:46.783 --> 00:54:49.327
<i>But there's something in him</i>

795
00:54:49.494 --> 00:54:53.915
<i>That I simply didn't see</i>

796
00:54:54.708 --> 00:54:56.918
<i>-Well. who'd have thought</i>
<i>-Well. bless my soul</i>

797
00:54:57.002 --> 00:54:58.795
<i>-Well. who'd have known</i>
<i>-Well. who indeed</i>

798
00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:01.589
<i>And who'd have guessed</i>
<i>They'd come together on their own</i>

799
00:55:01.715 --> 00:55:03.925
<i>-It's so peculiar</i>
<i>-We'll wait and see</i>

800
00:55:04.467 --> 00:55:06.136
<i>A few days more</i>

801
00:55:06.261 --> 00:55:09.556
<i>There maybe something there</i>
<i>That wasn't there before</i>

802
00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:13.476
You know. perhaps
there's something there

803
00:55:13.601 --> 00:55:15.270
that wasn't there before.

804
00:55:17.939 --> 00:55:21.568
<i>There may be something there</i>
<i>That wasn't there before</i>

805
00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:23.278
What's there. Mama?

806
00:55:24.195 --> 00:55:25.488
Shh.

807
00:55:25.572 --> 00:55:27.699
I'll tell you
when you're older.

808
00:55:41.463 --> 00:55:45.759
They start with a handful of notes.
crescendo in a symphony

809
00:55:45.842 --> 00:55:48.345
of imagination and creativity.

810
00:55:49.471 --> 00:55:52.849
<i>The sweeping score and songs</i>
<i>of Alan Menken.</i>

811
00:55:52.932 --> 00:55:55.894
<i>The unforgettable lyrics</i>
<i>of Howard Ashman.</i>

812
00:55:57.228 --> 00:56:01.566
<i>Together. they helped lead</i>
<i>a Disney animated musical renaissance</i>

813
00:56:01.649 --> 00:56:05.320
<i>with </i>Beauty and the Beast.
The Little Mermaid. <i>and</i> Aladdin.

814
00:56:07.697 --> 00:56:12.118
<i>While Ashman tragically passed away</i>
<i>before </i>Beauty and the Beast <i>was released.</i>

815
00:56:12.744 --> 00:56:16.748
<i>Menken has kept the spirit</i>
<i>of their partnership alive</i>

816
00:56:16.831 --> 00:56:21.503
<i>through his music</i>
<i>for Disney classics and beyond.</i>

817
00:56:22.379 --> 00:56:24.422
<i>Acclaimed as it is beloved.</i>

818
00:56:24.547 --> 00:56:27.133
<i>Menken and Ashman's work</i>
<i>on</i> Beauty and the Beast

819
00:56:27.217 --> 00:56:30.345
<i>did far more than achieve</i>
<i>a Tony nomination.</i>

820
00:56:30.553 --> 00:56:33.056
<i>four Grammys. and two Oscars.</i>

821
00:56:33.139 --> 00:56:35.725
The Oscar goes to Alan Menken
and Howard Ashman

822
00:56:35.809 --> 00:56:38.228
for "Beauty and the Beast"
from <i>Beauty and the Beast.</i>

<i>inspiring fans of all ages.</i>

825
00:56:46.569 --> 00:56:50.407
<i>including some of the biggest names</i>
<i>in the recording industry.</i>

826
00:56:52.158 --> 00:56:55.245
And just wait until you hear

827
00:56:55.453 --> 00:56:58.164
the wonderful rendition
of "Beauty and the Beast"

828
00:56:58.706 --> 00:56:59.874
that Shania Twain

829
00:56:59.958 --> 00:57:03.044
and eight-time Oscar-winning
composer Alan Menken

830
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:05.630
have in store.

831
00:57:22.564 --> 00:57:25.608
-Tonight is the night.

832
00:57:26.985 --> 00:57:28.278
I'm not sure I can do this.

833
00:57:28.445 --> 00:57:32.240
You don't have time to be timid.
You must be bold. daring.

834
00:57:32.407 --> 00:57:34.033
Bold. Daring.

835
00:57:37.871 --> 00:57:40.999
There will be music.
romantic candlelight.

836
00:57:41.875 --> 00:57:43.168
provided by myself.

837
00:57:43.751 --> 00:57:46.713
And when the moment is right.
you confess your love.

838
00:57:47.922 --> 00:57:51.843
Yes. I con...I ...
I... no. I can't.

839
00:57:51.968 --> 00:57:53.344
You care for the girl. don't you?

840
00:57:53.511 --> 00:57:55.638
-More than anything.

841
00:57:55.763 --> 00:57:57.348
Well. then you must tell her.

842
00:57:59.559 --> 00:58:03.271
<i>Voilà.</i> Oh. you look so...so...

843
00:58:03.396 --> 00:58:04.689
Stupid.

844
00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:09.819
Not quite the word I was looking for.
Perhaps a little more off the top.

845
00:58:14.449 --> 00:58:16.618
Your lady awaits.

846
00:58:41.017 --> 00:58:43.937
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

847
00:58:46.231 --> 00:58:49.108
<i>True as it can be</i>

848
00:58:51.444 --> 00:58:53.863
<i>Barely even friends</i>

849
00:58:54.113 --> 00:58:56.449
<i>Then somebody bends</i>

850
00:58:56.658 --> 00:58:59.452
<i>Unexpectedly</i>

851
00:59:01.829 --> 00:59:05.708
<i>Just a little change</i>

852
00:59:06.834 --> 00:59:09.462
<i>Small to say the least</i>

853
00:59:09.546 --> 00:59:14.759
<i>Both a little scared</i>
<i>Neither one prepared</i>

854
00:59:14.842 --> 00:59:18.012
<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>

855
00:59:20.515 --> 00:59:23.768
<i>Ever just the same</i>

856
00:59:25.311 --> 00:59:29.190
<i>Ever a surprise</i>

857
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:35.446
<i>Ever as before</i>
<i>Ever just as sure</i>

858
00:59:35.655 --> 00:59:39.200
<i>As the sun will rise</i>

859
00:59:39.993 --> 00:59:42.287
<i>Oh</i>

860
00:59:43.413 --> 00:59:46.666
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

861
00:59:48.084 --> 00:59:50.753
<i>Tune as old as song</i>

862
00:59:53.131 --> 00:59:55.717
<i>Bittersweet and strange</i>

863
00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:58.344
<i>Finding you can change</i>

864
00:59:58.428 --> 01:00:02.181
<i>Learning you were wrong</i>

865
01:00:03.516 --> 01:00:06.227
<i>Certain as the sun</i>

866
01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:10.690
<i>Rising in the east</i>

867
01:00:10.898 --> 01:00:13.109
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

868
01:00:13.318 --> 01:00:16.112
<i>Song as old as rhyme</i>

869
01:00:16.195 --> 01:00:20.700
<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>

870
01:00:22.368 --> 01:00:25.788
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

871
01:00:25.955 --> 01:00:29.250
<i>Song as old as rhyme</i>

872
01:00:31.502 --> 01:00:37.425
<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>

873
01:00:38.217 --> 01:00:40.553
<i>Off to the cupboard</i>
<i>with you now. Chip.</i>

874
01:00:41.012 --> 01:00:42.347
<i>-It's past your bedtime.</i>

875
01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:44.182
<i>Mm. mm</i>

876
01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:45.933
<i>Good night. love.</i>

877
01:01:07.455 --> 01:01:08.456
Belle?

878
01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:13.753
Are you happy here with me?

879
01:01:14.295 --> 01:01:15.505
Yes.

880
01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:21.511
What is it?

881
01:01:23.304 --> 01:01:25.390
If only I could see my father again.

882
01:01:25.807 --> 01:01:28.518
Just for a moment.
I miss him so much.

883
01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:35.608
There is a way.

884
01:01:39.070 --> 01:01:40.863
This mirror will show you anything.

885
01:01:41.447 --> 01:01:43.074
Anything you wish to see.

886
01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:47.161
I'd like to see my father. please.

887
01:01:54.168 --> 01:01:56.504
Papa! Oh. no.

888
01:01:57.422 --> 01:01:58.506
He's sick.

889
01:01:58.965 --> 01:02:01.467
He may be dying.
and he's all alone.

890
01:02:08.015 --> 01:02:10.727
Then you... you must go to him.

891
01:02:11.352 --> 01:02:13.855
-What did you say?
-I release you.

892
01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:15.982
You're no longer my prisoner.

893
01:02:16.232 --> 01:02:18.776
You mean... I'm free?

894
01:02:19.444 --> 01:02:20.653
Yes.

895
01:02:21.237 --> 01:02:22.822
Oh. thank you.

896
01:02:23.781 --> 01:02:26.117
Hold on. Papa. I'm on my way.

897
01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:30.163
Take it with you

898
01:02:30.621 --> 01:02:34.751
so you'll always have a way
to look back and remember me.

899
01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:41.507
Thank you for understanding
how much he needs me.

900
01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:52.018
Well. Your Highness.

901
01:02:52.101 --> 01:02:55.229
I must say everything is going
just swimmingly.

902
01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:58.107
I knew you had it in you.

903
01:02:58.357 --> 01:03:00.443
-I let her go.

904
01:03:00.526 --> 01:03:01.611
Yes. yes.

905
01:03:01.944 --> 01:03:04.614
Splen...you what?

906
01:03:05.573 --> 01:03:08.493
-How could you do that?
-I had to.

907
01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:11.829
Yes. but-but-but... but why?

908
01:03:11.996 --> 01:03:15.041
Because I love her.

909
01:03:41.192 --> 01:03:44.904
<i>I was the one who had it all</i>

910
01:03:45.988 --> 01:03:49.700
<i>I was the master of my fate</i>

911
01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:55.289
<i>I never needed anybody in my life</i>

912
01:03:55.581 --> 01:03:59.335
<i>I learned the truth too late</i>

913
01:04:00.294 --> 01:04:03.589
<i>I'll never shake away the pain</i>

914
01:04:04.966 --> 01:04:08.427
<i>I close my eyes but she's still there</i>

915
01:04:09.846 --> 01:04:14.267
<i>I let her steal into my melancholy heart</i>

916
01:04:14.725 --> 01:04:19.730
<i>It's more than I can bear</i>

917
01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:25.403
<i>Now I know she'll never leave me</i>

918
01:04:25.862 --> 01:04:30.032
<i>Even as she runs away</i>

919
01:04:30.157 --> 01:04:32.702
<i>She will still torment me</i>

920
01:04:33.035 --> 01:04:39.625
<i>Calm me. hurt me</i>
<i>Move me. come what may</i>

921
01:04:39.959 --> 01:04:44.005
<i>Wasting in my lonely tower</i>

922
01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:48.885
<i>Waiting by an open door</i>

923
01:04:50.052 --> 01:04:52.638
<i>I'll fool myself. she'll walk right in</i>

924
01:04:54.849 --> 01:04:58.603
<i>And be with me for evermore</i>

925
01:05:31.844 --> 01:05:35.389
<i>I rage against the trials of love</i>

926
01:05:36.265 --> 01:05:40.186
<i>I curse the fading of the light</i>

927
01:05:40.728 --> 01:05:44.649
<i>Though she's already flown</i>
<i>So far beyond my reach</i>

928
01:05:45.107 --> 01:05:50.738
<i>She's never out of sight</i>

929
01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:55.826
<i>Now I know she'll never leave me</i>

930
01:05:56.035 --> 01:06:00.122
<i>Even as she fades from view</i>

931
01:06:00.623 --> 01:06:03.584
<i>She will still inspire me</i>

932
01:06:03.668 --> 01:06:09.799
<i>Be a part of everything I do</i>

933
01:06:10.174 --> 01:06:14.512
<i>Wasting in my lonely tower</i>

934
01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:19.225
<i>Waiting by an open door</i>

935
01:06:19.850 --> 01:06:22.812
<i>I'll fool myself. she'll walk right in</i>

936
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:28.192
<i>And as the long. long nights begin</i>

937
01:06:28.567 --> 01:06:32.279
<i>I'll think of all that might have been</i>

938
01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:34.323
<i>Waiting here</i>

939
01:06:34.532 --> 01:06:41.455
<i>For evermore</i>

940
01:07:05.813 --> 01:07:08.149
What defines the legacy of a story?

941
01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:13.612
Its enduring impact both on
and off the screen for evermore.

942
01:07:14.613 --> 01:07:17.408
<i>Perhaps it's seeing</i>
<i>that story reinvented</i>

943
01:07:17.533 --> 01:07:21.120
<i>just as </i>Beauty and the Beast
<i>was in its ground-breaking.</i>

944
01:07:21.287 --> 01:07:23.956
<i>highly-acclaimed Broadway adaptation.</i>

945
01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:27.918
<i>Since then.</i>
<i>Disney Theatrical Productions</i>

946
01:07:28.002 --> 01:07:30.463
<i>under the direction</i>
<i>of its president and producer.</i>

947
01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:34.258
<i>Thomas Schumacher.</i>
<i>has forged a new chapter</i>

948
01:07:34.508 --> 01:07:37.928
<i>in the legacy</i>
<i>of this classic title.</i>

949
01:07:38.012 --> 01:07:41.098
<i>one that gave audiences</i>
<i>around the world</i>

950
01:07:41.223 --> 01:07:44.894
<i>a chance to fall in love</i>
<i>with these iconic characters</i>

951

01:07:50.399 --> 01:07:52.485
<i>to the warm Footlights</i>

01:07:52.818 --> 01:07:54.445
<i>and throughout the UK.</i>

954
01:07:56.822 --> 01:08:00.534
<i>Or perhaps the legacy</i>
<i>of this timeless classic</i>

955
01:08:00.618 --> 01:08:03.579
<i>is in witnessing the magical</i>
<i>spark of inspiration</i>

956
01:08:03.662 --> 01:08:06.832

<i>who wish they could be</i>
<i>part of its world.</i>

958
01:08:09.668 --> 01:08:13.464
<i>and in grown-ups</i>
<i>who still dream of the same.</i>

959
01:08:15.341 --> 01:08:18.010
As for where
that legacy will go from here.

960
01:08:19.386 --> 01:08:20.805
only time will tell.

961
01:08:21.263 --> 01:08:24.475
But if you would care to make
a prediction.

962
01:08:25.017 --> 01:08:27.978
please. be our guest.

963
01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:32.441
Hi!

964
01:08:46.539 --> 01:08:48.582
It's all right. Papa.
I'm home.

965
01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:52.920
I thought I'd never see you again.

966
01:08:53.712 --> 01:08:55.214
I missed you so much.

967
01:08:55.464 --> 01:08:57.883
But the Beast... how did you escape?

968
01:08:58.008 --> 01:09:00.761
I didn't escape. Papa.
He...he let me go.

969
01:09:01.178 --> 01:09:04.348
-That horrible Beast?
-But he's different now. Papa.

970
01:09:04.765 --> 01:09:07.101
He's changed somehow.

971
01:09:12.356 --> 01:09:15.526
-Hi!
-Oh. a stowaway.

972
01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:18.654
Why. hello there. little fella.

973
01:09:18.988 --> 01:09:21.073
Didn't think I'd see you again.

974
01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:25.703
Belle. why'd you go away?
Don't you like us anymore?

975
01:09:26.203 --> 01:09:28.289
Oh. Chip. of course I do.

976
01:09:28.414 --> 01:09:29.623
-It's just that...

977
01:09:32.668 --> 01:09:36.172
-May I help you?
<i>-I've come to collect your father.</i>

978
01:09:36.255 --> 01:09:39.008
<i>-My father?</i>
<i>-Don't worry. mademoiselle.</i>

979
01:09:39.592 --> 01:09:42.511
-We'll take good care of him.

980
01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:46.223
-My father's not crazy.
-He was raving like a lunatic.

981
01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:49.768
-We all heard him. didn't we?

982
01:09:49.935 --> 01:09:51.395
-No!

983
01:09:51.478 --> 01:09:53.105
-I won't let you.
-Belle?

984
01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:56.150
Maurice.
Tell us again. old man.

985
01:09:56.442 --> 01:10:00.070
Just how big was the Beast?

986
01:10:00.154 --> 01:10:03.073
He was...I mean. he was...
he was enormous!

987
01:10:03.157 --> 01:10:07.161
I'd say at least 8...
no. more like 10 feet.

988
01:10:09.371 --> 01:10:11.832
Well. you don't get
much crazier than that.

989
01:10:13.167 --> 01:10:14.668
It's true. I tell you!

990
01:10:15.502 --> 01:10:17.087
-Get him out of here.

991
01:10:17.171 --> 01:10:18.380
Let go of me!

992
01:10:18.756 --> 01:10:20.799
No! You can't do this.

993
01:10:22.301 --> 01:10:25.429
Poor Belle.
It's a shame about your father.

994
01:10:25.512 --> 01:10:27.306
You know he's not crazy. Gaston.

995
01:10:27.473 --> 01:10:32.853
Mm. I might be able to clear up
this little misunderstanding. if...

996
01:10:33.103 --> 01:10:35.814
-If what?
-If you marry me.

997
01:10:36.190 --> 01:10:38.275
-What?
-One little word. Belle.

998
01:10:38.359 --> 01:10:39.818
That's all it takes.

999
01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:41.445
-Never.
-Have it your way.

1000
01:10:41.612 --> 01:10:43.697
Belle? Hey...

1001
01:10:44.031 --> 01:10:45.157
Let go of me.

1002
01:10:45.532 --> 01:10:48.035
My father's not crazy.
and I can prove it.

1003
01:10:48.327 --> 01:10:49.703
Show me the Beast!

1004
01:10:58.295 --> 01:11:00.130
The Beast will make off
with your children.

1005
01:11:00.798 --> 01:11:01.924
He'll come after them
in the night.

1006
01:11:02.007 --> 01:11:03.676
-No!
-Gaston is right!

1007
01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:07.972
Look at its sharp. cruel fangs.
It's threat to us all!

1008
01:11:08.347 --> 01:11:11.016
We're not safe until its head
is mounted on my wall.

1009
01:11:11.433 --> 01:11:14.478
-I say we kill the Beast!
-Yeah!

1010
01:11:14.561 --> 01:11:16.480
No! I won't let you do this.

1011
01:11:16.563 --> 01:11:18.399
The monster must have her
under his spell.

1012
01:11:18.565 --> 01:11:20.567
He'll curse us all
if we don't stop him.

1013
01:11:21.068 --> 01:11:23.112
-Yeah!
-If you're not with us...

1014
01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:25.864
-you're against us!

1015
01:11:25.948 --> 01:11:27.074
Bring the old man.

1016
01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:29.285
Get your hands off me!

1017
01:11:29.618 --> 01:11:32.496
We can't have them running off
to warn the creature.

1018
01:11:32.621 --> 01:11:33.914
-Let us out!

1019
01:11:35.374 --> 01:11:38.460
We'll rid the village of this Beast.
Who's with me?

1020
01:11:38.544 --> 01:11:40.546
Yeah!

1021
01:11:40.629 --> 01:11:42.172
<i>Through the mist</i>
<i>Through the woods</i>

1022
01:11:42.256 --> 01:11:43.799
<i>Through the darkness and the shadows</i>

1023
01:11:43.882 --> 01:11:46.844
<i>It's a nightmare</i>
<i>But it's one exciting ride</i>

1024
01:11:46.927 --> 01:11:50.180
<i>Say a prayer then we're there</i>
<i>At the drawbridge of a castle</i>

1025
01:11:50.264 --> 01:11:53.058
<i>And there's something</i>
<i>Truly terrible inside</i>

1026
01:11:53.434 --> 01:11:56.770
<i>It's a beast</i>
<i>He's got fangs. razor sharp ones</i>

1027
01:11:56.854 --> 01:11:59.690
<i>Massive paws</i>
<i>Killer claws for the feast</i>

1028
01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:03.068
<i>Hear him roar. see him foam</i>
<i>But we're not coming home</i>

1029
01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:04.862
<i>Till he's dead</i>

1030
01:12:05.112 --> 01:12:06.613
<i>-Good and dead</i>
-Yeah!

1031
01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:08.324
<i>-Kill the beast</i>
<i>-Mount your horse</i>

1032
01:12:08.407 --> 01:12:10.117
<i>Screw your courage</i>
<i>To the sticking place</i>

1033
01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:13.078
<i>We're counting on Gaston</i>
<i>To lead the way</i>

1034
01:12:13.245 --> 01:12:16.332
<i>Through the mist. through the wood</i>
<i>Where within a haunted castle</i>

1035
01:12:16.415 --> 01:12:19.460
<i>Something's lurking</i>
<i>That you don't see every day</i>

1036
01:12:19.752 --> 01:12:22.671
<i>It's a beast</i>
<i>One as tall as a mountain</i>

1037
01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:26.216
<i>We won't rest till he's good and deceased</i>

1038
01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:29.595
<i>Sally forth. tally ho</i>
<i>Grab your sword. grab your bow</i>

1039
01:12:29.678 --> 01:12:31.096
<i>Praise the Lord and here we go</i>

1040
01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:32.890
We'll lay siege to the castle.

1041
01:12:33.098 --> 01:12:35.184
<i>We don't like</i>
<i>What we don't understand</i>

1042
01:12:35.267 --> 01:12:36.477
<i>In fact it scares us</i>

1043
01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:39.313
<i>And this monster is mysterious at least</i>

1044
01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:42.816
<i>Bring your guns. bring your knives</i>
<i>Save your children and your wives</i>

1045
01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:45.694
<i>We'll save our village and our lives</i>

1046
01:12:45.903 --> 01:12:47.363
<i>We'll kill the beast</i>

1047
01:12:47.571 --> 01:12:49.740
Take whatever booty
you can find.

1048
01:12:49.823 --> 01:12:52.868
But remember.
the Beast is mine!

1049
01:12:52.951 --> 01:12:55.954
<i>Hearts ablaze. banners high</i>
<i>We go marching into battle</i>

1050
01:12:56.038 --> 01:12:59.041
<i>Unafraid although</i>
<i>The danger just increased</i>

1051
01:12:59.249 --> 01:13:02.211
<i>Raise your flag. sing the song</i>
<i>Here we come. we're 50 strong</i>

1052
01:13:02.294 --> 01:13:06.548
<i>And 50 Frenchmen can't be wrong</i>
<i>Let's kill the beast</i>

1053
01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:29.780
-Now!

1054
01:13:47.005 --> 01:13:49.133
Yes!

1055
01:13:53.762 --> 01:13:55.013
Here we go!

1056
01:13:58.725 --> 01:14:01.103
-What the devil?

1057
01:14:01.186 --> 01:14:02.438
Belle. look out!

1058
01:14:09.194 --> 01:14:11.488
You guys gotta try
this thing.

1059
01:14:13.699 --> 01:14:16.743
-Move. move. move. move.

1060
01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:23.167
And stay out.

1061
01:14:25.836 --> 01:14:27.379
Ugh.

1062
01:14:53.447 --> 01:14:54.656
Get up.

1063
01:14:56.909 --> 01:14:58.035
Get up!

1064
01:14:58.577 --> 01:15:01.872
What's the matter. Beast?

1065
01:15:01.955 --> 01:15:04.958
Too kind and gentle
to fight back?

1066
01:15:12.382 --> 01:15:13.800
BELLE:<i> No!</i>

1067
01:15:16.553 --> 01:15:19.765
-Belle...
-No. Gaston. don't!

1068
01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:26.688
Let's go. Philippe.

1069
01:15:41.954 --> 01:15:44.122
Come on out and fight.

1070
01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:49.044
Were you in love with her.
Beast?

1071
01:15:49.127 --> 01:15:51.505
Did you honestly think
she'd want you

1072
01:15:51.672 --> 01:15:53.757
when she had someone like me?

1073
01:16:05.936 --> 01:16:07.771
It's over. Beast.

1074
01:16:08.021 --> 01:16:09.898
Belle is mine!

1075
01:16:14.027 --> 01:16:16.989
Let me go. Let me go!

1076
01:16:17.072 --> 01:16:18.407
Please. don't hurt me.

1077
01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:20.284
I'll do anything. Anything!

1078
01:16:34.631 --> 01:16:37.134
-Get out.

1079
01:16:37.384 --> 01:16:38.427
Beast!

1080
01:16:39.344 --> 01:16:40.554
Belle?

1081
01:16:49.563 --> 01:16:50.731
Belle.

1082
01:16:56.778 --> 01:16:58.280
You came back.

1083
01:17:22.512 --> 01:17:23.597
Oh.

1084
01:17:37.402 --> 01:17:38.362
You...

1085
01:17:40.197 --> 01:17:43.492
-you came back.
-Of course I came back.

1086
01:17:43.992 --> 01:17:45.202
I couldn't let them...

1087
01:17:45.952 --> 01:17:47.746
Oh. this is all my fault.

1088
01:17:48.205 --> 01:17:50.832
-If only I'd gotten here sooner.
-Maybe...

1089
01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:54.586
it's better... it's better this way.

1090
01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:56.129
Don't talk like that.

1091
01:17:57.172 --> 01:17:59.549
-You'll be all right.

1092
01:17:59.633 --> 01:18:02.969
We're together now.
Everything's going to be fine. You'll see.

1093
01:18:03.845 --> 01:18:05.430
At...

1094
01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:06.807
at least...

1095
01:18:07.849 --> 01:18:09.309
I got to see you

1096
01:18:10.644 --> 01:18:12.104
one last time.

1097
01:18:23.073 --> 01:18:23.949
No.

1098
01:18:24.157 --> 01:18:25.242
No!

1099
01:18:26.159 --> 01:18:28.036
Please. please.

1100
01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:30.080
Please. don't leave me.

1101
01:18:33.959 --> 01:18:35.252
I love you.

1102
01:20:54.432 --> 01:20:56.977
Belle. It's me!

1103
01:21:12.868 --> 01:21:14.286
It is you!

1104
01:21:47.402 --> 01:21:50.614
Lumière. Cogsworth!

1105
01:21:51.239 --> 01:21:53.575
Oh! Mrs. Potts!

1106
01:21:53.909 --> 01:21:55.869
-Look at us!

1107
01:21:55.994 --> 01:21:57.579
Mama. mama!

1108
01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:03.793
-Oh. my goodness.

1109
01:22:04.044 --> 01:22:05.754
-It is a miracle!

1110
01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:52.717
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

1111
01:22:54.678 --> 01:22:59.265
<i>True as it can be</i>

1112
01:23:01.267 --> 01:23:03.853
<i>Barely even friends</i>

1113
01:23:04.187 --> 01:23:11.152
<i>Then somebody bends unexpectedly</i>

1114
01:23:13.279 --> 01:23:16.324
<i>Just a little change</i>

1115
01:23:16.533 --> 01:23:19.077
<i>Just a little change</i>

1116
01:23:19.285 --> 01:23:22.372
<i>Small to say the least</i>

1117
01:23:22.664 --> 01:23:25.542
<i>Both a little scared</i>

1118
01:23:25.625 --> 01:23:28.378
<i>Neither one prepared</i>

1119
01:23:28.628 --> 01:23:34.801
<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>

1120
01:23:35.051 --> 01:23:39.889
<i>Ever just the same</i>

1121
01:23:41.391 --> 01:23:46.896
<i>Ever a surprise</i>

1122
01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:50.608
<i>Ever as before</i>

1123
01:23:50.692 --> 01:23:53.528
<i>Ever just as sure</i>

1124
01:23:53.778 --> 01:23:59.034
<i>As the sun will rise</i>

1125
01:24:09.252 --> 01:24:12.422
<i>Oh!</i>

1126
01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:40.533
<i>Certain as the sun</i>

1127
01:24:40.617 --> 01:24:43.703
H.E.R.: <i>Certain as the sun</i>

1128
01:24:43.787 --> 01:24:46.998
<i>Rising in the east</i>

1129
01:24:47.082 --> 01:24:50.251
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

1130
01:24:50.335 --> 01:24:53.379
<i>Song as old as rhyme</i>

1131
01:24:53.588 --> 01:24:59.969
<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>

1132
01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:03.056
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

1133
01:25:03.181 --> 01:25:06.309
<i>Song as old as rhyme</i>

1134
01:25:07.685 --> 01:25:10.563
<i>Beauty and</i>

1135
01:25:11.231 --> 01:25:17.570
<i>The Beast</i>

1136
01:26:38.735 --> 01:26:41.196
Follow me!

1137
01:26:42.155 --> 01:26:43.072
Lunch?

1138
01:26:45.325 --> 01:26:46.826
-Okay. one. two. three...
-Wolves.

1139
01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:51.289
Everybody sing along.

1140
01:27:01.049 --> 01:27:02.008
Uh...

1141
01:27:04.052 --> 01:27:07.972
Say hello to Mark Henn.
who actually animated Belle.

1142
01:27:11.142 --> 01:27:13.394
What kind of shenanigans
will happen next?

1143
01:27:16.606 --> 01:27:18.233
The amazing world of Disney.

1144
01:27:23.821 --> 01:27:24.948
Now bounce. now bounce.

1145
01:27:29.118 --> 01:27:31.204
I had the best time.
and I'm sad it's over.
