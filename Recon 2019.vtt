00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:22.781
<i>The Italians have quit</i>

4
00:01:22.847 --> 00:01:24.283
<i>and the Germans were
retreating.</i>

5
00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:26.718
<i>giving way slowly.</i>

6
00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:30.389
<i>violently making us pay
for every inch of ground.</i>

7
00:01:30.822 --> 00:01:32.225
<i>in time and in blood.</i>

8
00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:35.894
<i>For our patrols.</i>

9
00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:37.896
<i>snipers.</i>

10
00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:40.266
<i>landmines.</i>

11
00:01:43.068 --> 00:01:44.970
<i>but we went on anyway.</i>

12
00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:48.940
<i>putting one foot
in front of the other.</i>

13
00:01:49.975 --> 00:01:51.410
<i>holding our rifles.</i>

14
00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:54.247
<i>trying in all our misery.</i>

15
00:01:55.013 --> 00:01:58.150
<i>confusion and exhaustion
to remain watchful.</i>

16
00:01:59.218 --> 00:02:00.553
<i>if it wasn't the rain.</i>

17
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.853
<i>it was the cold
or the snow.</i>

18
00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:04.257
<i>All variations
of the same thing.</i>

19
00:02:06.158 --> 00:02:07.493
<i>It was suffocating.</i>

20
00:02:08.927 --> 00:02:10.196
<i>And no matter
how hard we tried.</i>

21
00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:12.164
<i>we just couldn't
get enough air.</i>

22
00:02:15.534 --> 00:02:17.436
<i>We were somewhere
near Cassino.</i>

23
00:02:17.503 --> 00:02:19.771
<i>but it was hard to believe
this was even Italy anymore.</i>

24
00:02:22.541 --> 00:02:23.576
<i>So we kept on.</i>

25
00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:26.412
<i>Alone in the waste
of the war.</i>

26
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.082
<i>And we continued
to be punished for it.</i>

27
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.967
She was with him.

28
00:03:26.104 --> 00:03:28.106
She would've shot us all
if she could've.

29
00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:29.974
Like fuckin' dominoes.

30
00:03:37.048 --> 00:03:38.850
"Fuckin' dominoes"?

31
00:03:40.152 --> 00:03:42.388
I don't know who's crazier.
him or the Nazis.

32
00:03:44.256 --> 00:03:46.891
Damn it. why do they always
gotta look like they're asleep?

33
00:04:00.172 --> 00:04:02.508
<i>What's the first thing
you're gonna do when you...?</i>

34
00:04:07.246 --> 00:04:09.348
<i>What's the first thing you're
gonna do when you get home?</i>

35
00:04:09.648 --> 00:04:11.650
For me. it's gonna
be Joe's Stone Crab.

36
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.419
Been around for 30 years.

37
00:04:13.486 --> 00:04:14.587
Best dungeness.

38
00:04:14.886 --> 00:04:16.222
Yeah. that's what
I'm gonna do.

39
00:04:16.288 --> 00:04:17.723
I dunno...

40
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.859
My old man told me
one time in the first war.

41
00:04:19.924 --> 00:04:20.959
Oh. here we go.

42
00:04:21.293 --> 00:04:23.329
- What?!
- Ignore him.

43
00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:25.131
Everybody listens
to his bullshit.

44
00:04:25.197 --> 00:04:26.632
Come on.
tell the story.

45
00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:28.300
All I was gonna say is
that this one time

46
00:04:28.367 --> 00:04:29.835
he ran through 50 yards
of gunfire

47
00:04:29.901 --> 00:04:31.102
just to get some chocolate.

48
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.004
Yeah. and you believe
that crap.

49
00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:35.408
- Fuckin' asshole.
- 50 yards of Gerrys popping off rounds

50
00:04:35.474 --> 00:04:37.976
just to get a damn Hershey's bar.

51
00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:40.780
And don't look at me like that.

52
00:04:41.313 --> 00:04:43.549
Reminds me of my brother
and that reminds me of home.

53
00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:45.785
And that just depresses
the shit out of me.

54
00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:47.085
Halt!

55
00:04:49.722 --> 00:04:51.524
Don't fuckin' move.

56
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.693
Hopewell. Walberg.

57
00:04:56.395 --> 00:04:57.962
Overturn that cart
and make sure

58
00:04:58.029 --> 00:05:00.199
that there are no
weapons or contraband.

59
00:06:18.076 --> 00:06:19.311
Go. go. go!

60
00:06:46.238 --> 00:06:48.207
I married
the lady next door.

61
00:06:49.441 --> 00:06:51.677
A widow. no less.
You know. her husband died.

62
00:06:52.811 --> 00:06:54.045
Slipped in the bath.

63
00:06:56.782 --> 00:06:59.585
No kidding. he fell
he cocked his head.

64
00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:00.953
And that was that.

65
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.354
He served us iced tea

66
00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:04.356
the afternoon that
it happened.

67
00:07:05.089 --> 00:07:06.792
It doesn't just take war.
you know?

68
00:07:09.528 --> 00:07:11.430
We're all in the crosshairs.
that's all I'm sayin'.

69
00:07:12.131 --> 00:07:13.132
That and I don't think...

70
00:07:13.198 --> 00:07:14.767
a woman
should have to die

71
00:07:14.833 --> 00:07:16.902
because she's got blood loyalty
to her fuckin' lover.

72
00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:19.505
After the Krauts
showed. Walberg and Hopewell..

73
00:07:20.906 --> 00:07:22.207
We got 'em.

74
00:07:23.074 --> 00:07:24.677
Woman died in the crossfire.

75
00:07:25.477 --> 00:07:27.880
I need more than a dead soldier

76
00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:28.948
and his lover. Sergeant.

77
00:07:29.548 --> 00:07:31.750
I've got 20 men a day
being killed by sniper fire.

78
00:07:31.817 --> 00:07:34.085
and word from above us
and his Highness Churchill

79
00:07:34.153 --> 00:07:36.689
wants to know what
the bloody holdup is.

80
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:38.757
I understand.

81
00:07:38.824 --> 00:07:39.992
Well. if you do. son.

82
00:07:40.059 --> 00:07:41.360
Get the hell out there

83
00:07:41.427 --> 00:07:43.862
and get me some
no-bullshit intelligence.

84
00:07:43.929 --> 00:07:45.197
Yes. sir.

85
00:07:45.998 --> 00:07:47.399
Jesus Christ.

86
00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.198
Hey.

87
00:08:55.768 --> 00:08:57.369
Some crossfire. huh?

88
00:08:59.638 --> 00:09:02.341
And we all heard that
bullshit story Sarge told.

89
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.481
You don't wanna talk about it.

90
00:09:12.751 --> 00:09:13.952
Fine by me.

91
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.803
Makes it impossible
to light a lady's cigarette.

92
00:09:32.172 --> 00:09:33.472
It's not nerves. though.

93
00:09:34.973 --> 00:09:36.475
Had it since I was 15.

94
00:09:41.947 --> 00:09:42.981
Now. this...

95
00:09:43.515 --> 00:09:45.517
This is fuckin' nerves.

96
00:09:48.353 --> 00:09:50.856
Never had anything like this
before the war started.

97
00:09:52.158 --> 00:09:53.392
Fought it since Sicily.

98
00:09:53.459 --> 00:09:55.327
I just keep fuckin'
diggin' at it.

99
00:10:07.439 --> 00:10:09.007
Thought Salerno
was fucked up.

100
00:10:12.644 --> 00:10:14.813
I don't give a shit. what I tell
you. you know what I mean?

101
00:10:15.347 --> 00:10:16.615
Here you go.

102
00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:27.893
Fuck you. Marson.

103
00:10:30.662 --> 00:10:32.397
Just trying to keep the peace?

104
00:10:33.432 --> 00:10:34.867
Is that it. Joyner?

105
00:10:34.933 --> 00:10:36.502
Did you try and stop him?

106
00:10:40.372 --> 00:10:41.640
I don't know.

107
00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.278
Never got the chance.

108
00:10:48.313 --> 00:10:50.783
- Wasn't what I asked you...
- I said I don't know. okay?

109
00:11:06.999 --> 00:11:08.300
This...

110
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:12.838
It's the end of times.

111
00:11:15.208 --> 00:11:16.642
Fuckin' end of the world.

112
00:11:17.776 --> 00:11:18.844
Fall in!

113
00:11:33.091 --> 00:11:35.561
Beautiful
fuckin' freezing Italy.

114
00:11:35.961 --> 00:11:38.864
You know. I have no idea why my
mom wants to visit here so bad.

115
00:11:41.633 --> 00:11:43.836
Smells like fuckin'
Michigan to me.

116
00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:46.538
You okay. Corporal?

117
00:11:47.573 --> 00:11:49.775
Yeah. just got blisters.
is all.

118
00:11:50.609 --> 00:11:51.910
Let's go.

119
00:11:57.482 --> 00:11:59.252
They call this a field jacket?

120
00:11:59.319 --> 00:12:00.619
What field? Fenway?

121
00:12:00.986 --> 00:12:03.789
Plus it doesn't keep you
dry or warm. so...

122
00:12:03.856 --> 00:12:05.524
I don't know what
the purpose is.

123
00:12:11.964 --> 00:12:13.098
Hey. I'm with you.

124
00:12:13.166 --> 00:12:15.901
- We gotta do somethin'.
- Otherwise we.

125
00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:18.904
You're askin' me?

126
00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.975
Hey. Corporal. is it true what
they say about your stripes?

127
00:12:23.041 --> 00:12:25.611
You got 'em chargin'
a machine-gun nest.

128
00:12:25.677 --> 00:12:27.347
took out four Krauts
all by yourself?

129
00:12:27.679 --> 00:12:29.249
Don't believe
everything you hear.

130
00:12:29.315 --> 00:12:31.450
Yeah. don't I know that.

131
00:12:32.352 --> 00:12:34.153
My uncle's a police officer.

132
00:12:34.486 --> 00:12:36.755
He told me all kind
of stories.

133
00:12:37.223 --> 00:12:38.891
He's a homicide detective.

134
00:12:40.626 --> 00:12:43.962
You ever wonder how someone
could do that all those years?

135
00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:46.531
Just one murder after another?

136
00:12:47.032 --> 00:12:48.767
Never gave it any thought.

137
00:12:48.834 --> 00:12:51.069
There's a lot
of 'em unsolved. too.

138
00:12:51.137 --> 00:12:53.972
Used to get kinda frustratin' for him.
The one thing

139
00:12:54.039 --> 00:12:56.808
that he hated was when
people saw something

140
00:12:56.875 --> 00:12:58.543
and wouldn't say
what they saw.

141
00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.715
Still a lot of murderers
walkin' these streets.

142
00:13:03.782 --> 00:13:05.184
Your uncle
really a detective?

143
00:13:05.251 --> 00:13:06.518
Yeah.
bet your ass. Heisman.

144
00:13:06.585 --> 00:13:07.519
That's good.

145
00:13:07.586 --> 00:13:08.787
When you get back home.

146
00:13:08.854 --> 00:13:10.390
Maybe he can solve
that mystery

147
00:13:10.455 --> 00:13:11.757
as to why your
balls haven't dropped.

148
00:13:11.823 --> 00:13:13.659
"Ha ha." says the guy
who showers with

149
00:13:13.725 --> 00:13:16.595
a football and sleeps with his
college ring under his pillow.

150
00:13:16.662 --> 00:13:18.164
Will you two keep your distance
and shut up?

151
00:13:18.231 --> 00:13:19.698
Shit. Heisman. if I had
your physique.

152
00:13:19.765 --> 00:13:21.267
I'd be
playing for the Bears already.

153
00:13:21.334 --> 00:13:22.768
Oh ho!
You think it's that easy?

154
00:13:22.834 --> 00:13:24.536
I miss football. so yeah.
I kinda do.

155
00:13:24.603 --> 00:13:25.704
<i>Fifty-one...</i>

156
00:13:25.771 --> 00:13:27.206
Fifty-two. fifty-three...

157
00:13:27.273 --> 00:13:28.840
Quiet. Shut up.

158
00:13:35.381 --> 00:13:38.650
I swear to God.
I will shoot you. Asch.

159
00:13:39.084 --> 00:13:42.087
Jesus fuckin' Christ.
you are pathetic. soldier.

160
00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:43.956
It's not my fault. sir!

161
00:13:44.022 --> 00:13:46.091
- I was born with short arms!
- Is that right?

162
00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:48.694
I'm like a crocodile.
it runs in my family.

163
00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.028
Sergeant Reece.
I'd like to. uh.

164
00:13:50.095 --> 00:13:51.630
request to finish
my squad mate's pushups.

165
00:13:51.697 --> 00:13:53.299
Look. I'm afraid that
Gerry see Asch.

166
00:13:53.366 --> 00:13:56.135
it only give 'em more
encouragement to fight.

167
00:13:59.138 --> 00:14:00.973
Get the hell down there.
Asch. get up.

168
00:14:02.507 --> 00:14:05.777
You are a fuckin' disgrace
to this and every other outfit.

169
00:14:06.511 --> 00:14:07.980
Yes. sir.

170
00:14:10.115 --> 00:14:11.016
Hey!

171
00:14:11.717 --> 00:14:13.819
- Keep those arms straight. Heisman.
- You fuck...

172
00:14:13.885 --> 00:14:15.520
Don't forget.
you represent me now.

173
00:14:15.587 --> 00:14:16.922
Oh. do you ever shut up?

174
00:14:17.423 --> 00:14:18.824
No.

175
00:14:20.159 --> 00:14:21.793
I was on 24.

176
00:14:55.194 --> 00:14:57.263
- You got an answer?
- I'm workin' on it.

177
00:14:57.497 --> 00:14:58.797
These are fresh.

178
00:14:58.864 --> 00:15:00.899
Maybe a day or so.

179
00:15:00.966 --> 00:15:03.503
They're Panzers. no doubt.

180
00:15:04.102 --> 00:15:07.173
Fuckin' perfect place
for an ambush. Troutman?

181
00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.907
They want us
to keep going forward.

182
00:15:08.974 --> 00:15:11.710
- Look to engage enemy patrols.
- Good.

183
00:15:14.713 --> 00:15:17.049
Something's coming.
Get ready!

184
00:15:18.917 --> 00:15:21.220
- It's just an old man!
- Yeah. we'll see.

185
00:15:23.855 --> 00:15:26.492
<i>- Do not move. Stop!
- Sono Italiano.</i>

186
00:15:26.558 --> 00:15:28.261
Shut up. you speak English?

187
00:15:28.327 --> 00:15:30.562
What is he saying?

188
00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:32.331
- What is he saying?
- I don't know!

189
00:15:32.398 --> 00:15:33.865
Uh. he's saying
he's our friend.

190
00:15:34.766 --> 00:15:37.069
Put the fuckin' cart down.
Put the cart down.

191
00:15:37.136 --> 00:15:38.538
- Get away from the cart.
- He's saying our friend.

192
00:15:38.603 --> 00:15:40.239
Don't shoot me!
Please.

193
00:15:40.306 --> 00:15:41.374
Come here.

194
00:15:41.441 --> 00:15:42.774
- Please!
- Shut up.

195
00:15:42.841 --> 00:15:45.610
Joyner. Troutman. on the cart.

196
00:15:45.677 --> 00:15:47.913
The rest of you.
on the ready.

197
00:15:49.981 --> 00:15:51.350
You know this country?

198
00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:54.086
<i>- Capisce?
- Capisce</i>

199
00:15:54.487 --> 00:15:56.054
Are there Germans ahead?

200
00:15:56.121 --> 00:15:58.824
<i>- Si.
- What is that. a fuckin' yes or a no?</i>

201
00:15:58.890 --> 00:15:59.825
- Si.
- You're gonna be okay.

202
00:15:59.891 --> 00:16:01.227
Shut up. Corporal!

203
00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:04.130
Can help you.

204
00:16:05.164 --> 00:16:07.799
Germans. Germans. Yes.

205
00:16:07.866 --> 00:16:10.503
Up the mountain.

206
00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:11.770
Up the fuckin' mountain?

207
00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:14.340
Germans up the mountain?

208
00:16:14.407 --> 00:16:15.575
<i>- Si!
- You guide!</i>

209
00:16:15.974 --> 00:16:19.145
You show us where
the Tedesco are.

210
00:16:20.011 --> 00:16:22.614
<i>Si. I guide. I guide.</i>

211
00:16:22.681 --> 00:16:25.351
You guide us up the mountain and
show us where the Germans are. Si?

212
00:16:25.418 --> 00:16:27.786
<i>- Si. si!
- Tedeski. Si?</i>

213
00:16:27.853 --> 00:16:30.289
<i>- Io. I guide. Si.
- Molto. many? Many Germans?</i>

214
00:16:30.356 --> 00:16:31.690
Marson. you lead.

215
00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:34.594
Take Asch. Joyner.
and Heisman with you.

216
00:16:34.659 --> 00:16:35.994
He's saying.
"Many Germans."

217
00:16:36.061 --> 00:16:37.863
We have no idea
the size of the force.

218
00:16:37.929 --> 00:16:40.266
Just stick to
the fuckin' trees.

219
00:16:42.401 --> 00:16:45.003
Give us Troutman.
we'll radio back.

220
00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:46.372
No.

221
00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.242
I need him here
with me.

222
00:16:50.675 --> 00:16:52.345
A nice long walk...

223
00:16:53.212 --> 00:16:55.714
it has a way of
settling things for men.

224
00:16:57.682 --> 00:16:59.452
Let's go. the rest of you
on me.

225
00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:01.119
<i>Si. si.</i>

226
00:17:01.653 --> 00:17:04.022
Heisman. Joyner. Asch.
Let's go.

227
00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:06.858
Walk long. Big mountain.

228
00:17:20.739 --> 00:17:22.408
Oh! Fuck...

229
00:17:22.475 --> 00:17:26.345
You okay?

230
00:17:26.412 --> 00:17:29.448
Yeah. just ask my lady when I get home.
How 'bout that?

231
00:18:06.751 --> 00:18:07.919
Why us?

232
00:18:08.321 --> 00:18:10.021
I'll tell you why us.

233
00:18:10.088 --> 00:18:11.657
Fuck! Ah!

234
00:18:11.723 --> 00:18:12.891
Thanks. Heisman.

235
00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:14.227
Shit's sakes. Asch.

236
00:18:14.293 --> 00:18:15.794
What are you.
fucking retarded?

237
00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.230
I feel like a kid again.

238
00:18:17.296 --> 00:18:18.797
You look like an asshole.

239
00:18:18.863 --> 00:18:20.132
Fuck you.

240
00:18:22.468 --> 00:18:23.768
Fuckin' Yid.

241
00:18:24.637 --> 00:18:27.273
You wanna keep those
opinions to yourself. Joyner?

242
00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:28.441
Why?

243
00:18:28.708 --> 00:18:30.809
Mr. All American?

244
00:18:30.875 --> 00:18:32.445
You're gonna
kick my ass?

245
00:18:32.511 --> 00:18:33.713
Careful now.

246
00:18:33.945 --> 00:18:36.382
With this chain.
you get the whole fuckin' dog.

247
00:18:48.093 --> 00:18:50.296
They're gonna find
chunks of you in my shit.

248
00:18:50.363 --> 00:18:52.797
- You have really pretty eyes.
- Stand down. both of you!

249
00:18:52.864 --> 00:18:54.533
That's an order!

250
00:18:58.471 --> 00:18:59.938
We're on a mission.

251
00:19:00.905 --> 00:19:02.308
Really?

252
00:19:02.742 --> 00:19:04.477
What precisely
would that be?

253
00:19:04.543 --> 00:19:06.579
You know damn well what.

254
00:19:07.078 --> 00:19:08.714
I'd rather
be back at basecamp.

255
00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.283
I dunno. Joyner.

256
00:19:10.349 --> 00:19:12.951
You might get lucky and find
a friendly goat up here.

257
00:19:13.018 --> 00:19:14.320
Says Cary Grant.

258
00:19:15.354 --> 00:19:17.323
Asch. you been with anybody
besides your left hand?

259
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:19.659
Well. let's see.
Uh. there was your ma.

260
00:19:19.725 --> 00:19:21.360
your aunt.

261
00:19:21.427 --> 00:19:23.529
Your sister twice if you factor
in daylight savings time.

262
00:19:23.596 --> 00:19:24.730
I'll kill you.

263
00:19:24.796 --> 00:19:26.265
Hey. you started it.

264
00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:29.067
Let's go.

265
00:19:32.804 --> 00:19:36.309
I'll say it again.
We just know too damn much.

266
00:19:37.209 --> 00:19:38.711
That a fact. Philip Marlowe?

267
00:19:38.778 --> 00:19:41.079
Complicated by
the fact that the...

268
00:19:41.147 --> 00:19:44.015
Sergeant knows the Corporal and I
adhere to a strict set of morals.

269
00:19:44.082 --> 00:19:46.485
Be quiet. Asch. you don't know
anything about me.

270
00:19:46.552 --> 00:19:48.019
Yes. I do.

271
00:19:48.086 --> 00:19:49.655
You come from money.

272
00:19:49.722 --> 00:19:51.089
Yeah. what makes you
say that?

273
00:19:51.157 --> 00:19:52.591
You went to college.

274
00:19:52.658 --> 00:19:54.293
Private college.
that takes money.

275
00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.762
You read Nietzsche
which in turn means

276
00:19:56.828 --> 00:19:59.030
<i>you got morals and free time.</i>

277
00:19:59.097 --> 00:20:00.566
That takes money.

278
00:20:00.633 --> 00:20:02.067
Bright guy.

279
00:20:03.135 --> 00:20:04.236
Well. you New York boys
so bright...

280
00:20:04.303 --> 00:20:05.904
What "boys." Joyner?

281
00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:07.673
Do you want to give me
a more specific category?

282
00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:09.275
Because last time I checked.

283
00:20:09.342 --> 00:20:10.909
I happen to be born
in Boston.

284
00:20:11.677 --> 00:20:13.945
- You know what category.
- You have no idea.

285
00:20:14.347 --> 00:20:16.315
Why don't you just man up
and fill us the fuck in?

286
00:20:16.382 --> 00:20:17.416
Enough!

287
00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:20.453
Now let's get
something straight.

288
00:20:20.519 --> 00:20:22.555
We are going up this hill and
we're gonna see what we see.

289
00:20:22.621 --> 00:20:24.590
Then we're turning around
and coming back down

290
00:20:24.657 --> 00:20:26.592
and we're not spending anymore
energy fighting each other.

291
00:20:26.659 --> 00:20:27.827
Do you got it?

292
00:20:27.892 --> 00:20:29.462
Just tell him
to lay the fuck off.

293
00:20:29.528 --> 00:20:31.497
No! I'm not getting
in between you anymore.

294
00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:33.532
I'm telling you how
it's gonna be!

295
00:20:33.599 --> 00:20:34.933
Fine.

296
00:20:34.999 --> 00:20:36.968
Sarge wants to dump all you.
I get that.

297
00:20:37.035 --> 00:20:38.738
But why me?

298
00:20:38.804 --> 00:20:40.439
Well. because apparently.

299
00:20:40.506 --> 00:20:42.274
He hates you. too.

300
00:20:42.341 --> 00:20:43.509
And fuck you!

301
00:20:44.008 --> 00:20:46.512
No matter what you're talkin' about.

302
00:20:46.812 --> 00:20:48.247
What did he say?

303
00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:51.950
He wants us to die
choking on our own blood.

304
00:20:53.319 --> 00:20:55.987
He's a fuckin' fascist. I'm tellin' you.

305
00:20:56.054 --> 00:20:57.156
Keep your mouth shut.
Joyner!

306
00:20:57.223 --> 00:20:58.391
- Fuckin'...
- Shut your mouth!

307
00:20:58.691 --> 00:21:01.025
Don't open it again
unless it's to breathe.

308
00:21:01.926 --> 00:21:04.563
Let's go!

309
00:21:23.047 --> 00:21:24.983
I just got off a fuckin' farm.

310
00:21:25.518 --> 00:21:28.788
And now. I'm back
in farm country.

311
00:21:28.854 --> 00:21:30.523
In fuckin' Italy!

312
00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.124
Beautiful fuckin' Italy.

313
00:21:33.192 --> 00:21:34.926
Hey did I ever tell you
about my grandfather?

314
00:21:34.993 --> 00:21:38.130
Yeah. but you can tell me again.
It's a good story.

315
00:21:40.733 --> 00:21:43.569
My mother's father

316
00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:44.837
grew up in Germany.

317
00:21:44.904 --> 00:21:46.772
Very proud of his country.

318
00:21:46.839 --> 00:21:48.908
World War I comes along.

319
00:21:48.973 --> 00:21:50.643
he's in his late 30s.

320
00:21:50.709 --> 00:21:52.178
he goes off and fights

321
00:21:52.244 --> 00:21:53.846
with honor for the Kaiser.

322
00:21:53.913 --> 00:21:55.448
He even gets a medal
or something.

323
00:21:55.514 --> 00:21:57.249
After the war.

324
00:21:57.316 --> 00:21:59.185
he gets out.
and he comes to America

325
00:21:59.585 --> 00:22:02.254
so he can make a better...
make a better life for his family.

326
00:22:02.954 --> 00:22:03.988
Last year.

327
00:22:04.055 --> 00:22:05.324
he dies

328
00:22:05.391 --> 00:22:07.193
in the living room of
an apartment

329
00:22:07.259 --> 00:22:08.794
in Brockton. Massachusetts.

330
00:22:08.861 --> 00:22:10.995
after eatin' a meal of salmon

331
00:22:11.062 --> 00:22:12.598
and dill sauce

332
00:22:12.665 --> 00:22:14.133
that his daughter-in-law

333
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.167
cooked for him.

334
00:22:15.234 --> 00:22:16.769
Guess where she came from?

335
00:22:16.836 --> 00:22:20.372
Italy! So the man had been
in the first World War

336
00:22:20.439 --> 00:22:23.074
fightin' on the other side.

337
00:22:23.142 --> 00:22:25.177
in the Ardennes Forest.
shooting

338
00:22:25.244 --> 00:22:28.481
the French and English
and American soldiers

339
00:22:28.547 --> 00:22:33.017
to an apartment in Brockton
with a grandson

340
00:22:33.084 --> 00:22:34.753
about to join the Army

341
00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:36.388
to go fight the Hun.

342
00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:40.326
The whole thing's pretty fuckin'
ridiculous. wouldn't you say?

343
00:22:40.392 --> 00:22:42.328
I don't care to say.

344
00:22:47.266 --> 00:22:49.067
Fuck. that looks cold.

345
00:22:50.603 --> 00:22:52.003
Now what?

346
00:23:10.356 --> 00:23:12.157
Looks empty.

347
00:23:12.224 --> 00:23:13.192
We'll be wide
open for sniper fire

348
00:23:13.259 --> 00:23:14.260
crossin' that thing.

349
00:23:14.326 --> 00:23:15.694
Our alternative?

350
00:23:16.295 --> 00:23:18.797
A couple hours around.
at least?

351
00:23:23.536 --> 00:23:25.204
Cross the bridge.

352
00:23:25.271 --> 00:23:26.972
<i>Bridge sicuro. safe.</i>

353
00:23:27.038 --> 00:23:28.874
Nice fuckin' try.
Judas.

354
00:23:28.941 --> 00:23:30.309
Yeah.

355
00:23:30.376 --> 00:23:32.177
For once in my life.
I have to agree. Yeah.

356
00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:33.445
It looks like
we gotta turn back.

357
00:23:33.512 --> 00:23:34.914
We're not
turning back.

358
00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.248
Corporal.

359
00:23:36.315 --> 00:23:37.883
While we're hopscotching
across that thing.

360
00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:40.019
his Kraut pals
can pick us off one at a time.

361
00:23:40.084 --> 00:23:41.787
- I'll go first.
- No.

362
00:23:43.722 --> 00:23:44.924
He does.

363
00:23:45.558 --> 00:23:47.726
<i>- Si.
- Yeah.</i>

364
00:23:47.793 --> 00:23:48.894
Yeah.

365
00:23:48.961 --> 00:23:50.262
Okay.

366
00:24:13.752 --> 00:24:16.455
I got a pack of Lucky Strikes
says he goes belly up.

367
00:24:16.522 --> 00:24:18.657
- Shut up.
- I'll take that action.

368
00:24:18.958 --> 00:24:20.793
Where did you get
Lucky Strikes?

369
00:25:30.863 --> 00:25:32.931
Come on. you big bastard.

370
00:25:57.389 --> 00:25:59.925
He is one nimble
son of a bitch.

371
00:26:01.527 --> 00:26:03.395
Why don't you just
marry the guy already?

372
00:26:03.462 --> 00:26:05.364
You know. Joyner.
the more I hang out with you.

373
00:26:05.431 --> 00:26:08.801
the more I understand the Germans'
point of view on eugenics.

374
00:26:10.636 --> 00:26:12.771
Now where are my
Lucky Strikes?

375
00:26:28.887 --> 00:26:30.355
Yi. Yeah...

376
00:26:48.574 --> 00:26:51.144
Hey. it's just like a ride
at Coney Island.

377
00:26:51.211 --> 00:26:52.778
Yeah. just like it!

378
00:26:52.845 --> 00:26:55.247
Nibble on a goal post.
you Neanderthal.

379
00:26:56.815 --> 00:26:58.617
- Shit!
- Hey. it's okay!

380
00:26:58.684 --> 00:27:00.786
Keep moving. buddy!

381
00:27:01.253 --> 00:27:03.223
Okay! Okay!

382
00:27:04.289 --> 00:27:07.826
- Fuck! Shit! Shit! Shit!
- You okay. Asch? Keep moving.

383
00:27:12.431 --> 00:27:14.032
You got it. buddy!

384
00:27:15.334 --> 00:27:16.702
That a kid!

385
00:27:24.076 --> 00:27:25.444
Ah. fuck!

386
00:27:39.324 --> 00:27:41.627
Feel free to jump
if you want. Joyner!

387
00:27:41.693 --> 00:27:43.996
Shut the fuck up. Asch!

388
00:27:48.367 --> 00:27:49.668
Jesus Christ!

389
00:27:51.204 --> 00:27:52.738
Oh. fuck!

390
00:27:55.707 --> 00:27:57.409
You like the
show. you old fuck?

391
00:27:57.476 --> 00:27:59.311
Jesus Christ.

392
00:28:00.913 --> 00:28:02.681
Hey. Heisman.

393
00:28:03.115 --> 00:28:06.718
This is Coney Island.
where's my Nathan's hot dog?

394
00:28:06.785 --> 00:28:08.620
I got your hot dog right here.

395
00:28:20.065 --> 00:28:21.733
- Heisman!
- Heisman!

396
00:28:22.235 --> 00:28:24.503
- Go. go. go!
- Heisman. fuck!

397
00:28:30.143 --> 00:28:31.910
Your ring! Ah!

398
00:28:32.744 --> 00:28:33.846
My ring!

399
00:28:33.912 --> 00:28:36.216
My fuckin' ring! My ring!
My fuckin' ring!

400
00:28:36.282 --> 00:28:37.616
Come on!

401
00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:39.319
I'll get it!

402
00:28:39.384 --> 00:28:40.786
- My fucking ring!
- I'll get it!

403
00:28:40.853 --> 00:28:43.522
What the fuck...
give the fucking morphine!

404
00:28:44.224 --> 00:28:46.425
Corporal! Corporal!

405
00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.395
Asch! Asch. what
the hell are you doing?!

406
00:28:50.762 --> 00:28:52.631
Asch. get your ass
back here!

407
00:28:52.698 --> 00:28:55.500
Ah! Okay.
Ten more lousy...

408
00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:56.501
Fucking feet!

409
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.643
Fuck! Fuck! Oh! Oh.

410
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:06.212
I got it!

411
00:29:06.279 --> 00:29:08.413
Heisman! I got it!

412
00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.149
I got it!

413
00:29:18.324 --> 00:29:21.660
Heisman! Heisman!
I got it. buddy!

414
00:29:27.933 --> 00:29:29.135
<i>Heisman!</i>

415
00:29:37.576 --> 00:29:39.312
Heisman! Heisman!

416
00:29:39.379 --> 00:29:41.480
I got it. buddy. Hey!

417
00:29:41.546 --> 00:29:44.449
- Heisma--Fuck you.
you coulda got us all killed!

418
00:29:49.054 --> 00:29:50.422
We're cursed!

419
00:29:51.056 --> 00:29:52.491
We're fuckin' cursed!

420
00:29:52.557 --> 00:29:54.626
'Cause the God damn whore!

421
00:29:55.328 --> 00:29:56.329
Fuck!

422
00:29:56.396 --> 00:29:57.696
That much noise

423
00:29:57.763 --> 00:29:59.698
if there are Germans.
they've been hearing us.

424
00:29:59.765 --> 00:30:01.234
They're comin' this way.

425
00:30:01.301 --> 00:30:03.502
We'll stick to the riverbank
and head south.

426
00:30:05.871 --> 00:30:07.439
We're headin' south. Asch.

427
00:30:07.506 --> 00:30:10.575
What?! We're just gonna
leave him here?

428
00:30:10.642 --> 00:30:12.178
We don't have a choice!

429
00:30:14.147 --> 00:30:15.447
We have to move!

430
00:30:18.318 --> 00:30:21.053
Pops wants to get us somewhere
real fast. that's for sure.

431
00:30:23.021 --> 00:30:24.056
<i>He fuckin' knew.</i>

432
00:30:25.291 --> 00:30:26.591
You see this?!

433
00:30:27.759 --> 00:30:29.828
This is on you!

434
00:30:30.363 --> 00:30:32.464
This is on you!

435
00:30:36.969 --> 00:30:38.503
Oh... what...?

436
00:30:39.071 --> 00:30:40.939
Get your shit.
we're goin'!

437
00:31:25.418 --> 00:31:26.985
What is your name?

438
00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:29.955
What are you called?

439
00:31:30.022 --> 00:31:32.358
I'm Robert Marson.
You're... your name?

440
00:31:32.425 --> 00:31:33.393
Angelo.

441
00:31:33.459 --> 00:31:34.926
Angelo.

442
00:31:35.827 --> 00:31:37.397
Were you in the Army.
Angelo?

443
00:31:37.463 --> 00:31:39.432
<i>Si. Uh...</i>

444
00:31:39.499 --> 00:31:41.434
<i>Prima guerra mondiale.</i>

445
00:31:41.501 --> 00:31:42.601
The first war.

446
00:31:42.667 --> 00:31:44.270
<i>Si. si.</i>

447
00:31:44.337 --> 00:31:45.771
Did you fight?

448
00:31:46.439 --> 00:31:47.706
You know. fight?

449
00:31:47.773 --> 00:31:49.975
<i>Si. si. Io ero capitano.</i>

450
00:31:50.042 --> 00:31:52.544
<i>- You were a Captain.
- Si.</i>

451
00:31:53.212 --> 00:31:54.713
The fuck is that?

452
00:31:55.747 --> 00:31:57.150
It's a soldier.

453
00:31:57.216 --> 00:31:59.951
He's wearing our colors!
He's one of ours!

454
00:32:14.534 --> 00:32:15.967
"Shaw"

455
00:32:16.502 --> 00:32:17.903
I don't know. an...

456
00:32:18.371 --> 00:32:19.571
Single shot.

457
00:32:19.638 --> 00:32:20.739
Sniper?

458
00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.409
- Looks that way.
- Fuckin' great!

459
00:32:23.476 --> 00:32:25.110
Now we got the
Red Baron after us.

460
00:32:25.178 --> 00:32:26.645
He's been dead a while.

461
00:32:26.711 --> 00:32:27.979
Yeah.

462
00:32:28.414 --> 00:32:30.649
He's frozen solid.

463
00:32:31.817 --> 00:32:33.051
The hell's he doin'
all the way out here?

464
00:32:33.118 --> 00:32:34.653
He's probably tryin'
to go home.

465
00:32:34.719 --> 00:32:35.987
Shut up. Asch!

466
00:32:42.894 --> 00:32:44.729
Let's go.
Angelo!

467
00:32:44.796 --> 00:32:46.299
<i>- On me!
- Bene.</i>

468
00:32:49.469 --> 00:32:50.802
Move out.

469
00:32:55.907 --> 00:32:57.676
Come on!

470
00:33:02.614 --> 00:33:04.049
Fuck!

471
00:33:22.502 --> 00:33:23.902
<i>I remember
when I was 12 years old.</i>

472
00:33:23.969 --> 00:33:25.704
<i>I saw my first fist fight.</i>

473
00:33:27.507 --> 00:33:30.909
<i>These two teenagers just goin' at
it. boxing back and forth.</i>

474
00:33:33.645 --> 00:33:35.113
<i>The one guy...</i>

475
00:33:35.181 --> 00:33:38.083
<i>comin' at the other.
he had this...</i>

476
00:33:38.884 --> 00:33:41.254
<i>thin line of blood
around his mouth.</i>

477
00:33:45.558 --> 00:33:49.195
<i>I'll never forget the sound of their
fists hitting each other's faces.</i>

478
00:33:51.897 --> 00:33:55.000
<i>They must've been in that
dance for a mile or so.</i>

479
00:33:57.836 --> 00:33:59.704
And I followed them.

480
00:33:59.771 --> 00:34:02.040
Every single step.

481
00:34:03.742 --> 00:34:05.178
Good for you.

482
00:34:06.212 --> 00:34:08.181
What the fuck are you
tellin' me for?

483
00:34:09.549 --> 00:34:11.250
I was fascinated.

484
00:34:11.883 --> 00:34:13.785
Sounds it.

485
00:34:14.453 --> 00:34:16.688
That's fuck'...
That's fuckin' amazing.

486
00:34:20.459 --> 00:34:22.060
What's amazing?

487
00:34:22.761 --> 00:34:25.231
Ah. just the Corporal.

488
00:34:26.399 --> 00:34:27.832
Jesus.

489
00:34:30.469 --> 00:34:31.803
Look...

490
00:34:33.439 --> 00:34:35.241
If we don't do anything...

491
00:34:35.774 --> 00:34:38.076
we're just as guilty
as Reece is.

492
00:34:40.446 --> 00:34:43.149
Are you forgetting Hopewell
and Walberg got killed?

493
00:34:43.982 --> 00:34:45.917
She didn't do anything...

494
00:34:46.219 --> 00:34:47.719
but yell.

495
00:34:48.454 --> 00:34:49.721
And die.

496
00:34:51.357 --> 00:34:53.526
There's nothing
we can do about it now.

497
00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.462
Can you please
stop talking about her?

498
00:34:57.163 --> 00:34:59.131
The longer that we wait...

499
00:35:00.065 --> 00:35:01.434
The worse it's gonna be.

500
00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:02.901
You got a radio?

501
00:35:03.636 --> 00:35:05.003
Didn't think so.

502
00:35:05.971 --> 00:35:08.307
We are going to
finish this mission.

503
00:35:10.008 --> 00:35:11.743
Yeah.
the suicide mission you mean.

504
00:35:13.579 --> 00:35:17.015
Corporal. I don't buy that he can't
understand a single word we're sayin'.

505
00:35:19.151 --> 00:35:20.286
Thanks.

506
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:25.757
He's leading
us into a Nazi regiment.

507
00:35:25.824 --> 00:35:26.925
We're lost.

508
00:35:26.992 --> 00:35:28.760
I fuckin' guarantee you.

509
00:35:28.893 --> 00:35:30.329
I'll tell you when we're lost.

510
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:32.665
You'll tell
me when I'm lost?

511
00:35:32.732 --> 00:35:34.533
We're gonna lose daylight.

512
00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:35.800
Let's move out.

513
00:35:36.269 --> 00:35:38.036
We could be
anywhere up this fucker.

514
00:35:38.638 --> 00:35:42.141
It'll be three miles
back up the road. you know it.

515
00:35:42.208 --> 00:35:44.410
Yeah. three miles above
the road. I know that.

516
00:35:46.612 --> 00:35:48.247
Oh. shit.

517
00:35:50.849 --> 00:35:52.784
How much farther. Angelo?

518
00:35:55.321 --> 00:35:56.422
Not far.

519
00:35:57.889 --> 00:35:59.891
This son of a bitch
is lying.

520
00:35:59.958 --> 00:36:02.961
Shut up. Joyner.
You know...

521
00:36:03.895 --> 00:36:06.165
I used to swim
in a lake like this...

522
00:36:06.699 --> 00:36:08.867
in the summertime
in Sharon. Mass.

523
00:36:14.573 --> 00:36:15.974
Move out.

524
00:36:22.315 --> 00:36:23.815
You guys are...

525
00:36:24.283 --> 00:36:25.651
good Christians?

526
00:36:26.352 --> 00:36:29.522
You believe in an angry God is
interested in payback. right?

527
00:36:29.588 --> 00:36:32.491
"Vengeance is mine."
all that stuff.

528
00:36:33.091 --> 00:36:36.094
Well. I think we're gonna pay
for... earlier.

529
00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:38.830
In fact.

530
00:36:39.898 --> 00:36:41.600
- I think we might be
paying for it right now.

531
00:36:41.667 --> 00:36:42.934
You're so full of shit!

532
00:36:43.001 --> 00:36:45.036
Shut the fuck up.
Let it go!

533
00:36:45.837 --> 00:36:47.139
Besides. it's our religion.

534
00:36:47.206 --> 00:36:49.074
We're the ones goin'
to hell. not you.

535
00:36:49.141 --> 00:36:51.277
Yeah. I'm not even
gonna answer that.

536
00:36:51.876 --> 00:36:54.280
Christ. Joyner.
the way your mind works...

537
00:36:54.347 --> 00:36:56.282
Talk about it back at base.

538
00:36:57.115 --> 00:36:58.517
Thing is. Corporal.

539
00:36:58.584 --> 00:37:01.187
can't get the image of
her legs out of my head.

540
00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:06.492
All right. let's move out.

541
00:37:18.704 --> 00:37:20.439
Shh!

542
00:37:24.976 --> 00:37:26.945
Leave him be.

543
00:37:28.514 --> 00:37:30.149
This is his land.

544
00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:34.453
- We're trespassing on it.
- Jesus Christ.

545
00:37:36.355 --> 00:37:37.989
There's no end to this shit.

546
00:37:38.457 --> 00:37:40.393
We'd be in fuckin'
Switzerland by now.

547
00:37:40.892 --> 00:37:41.893
<i>Si.</i>

548
00:37:44.996 --> 00:37:46.998
Yeah. you understood that.
didn't ya?

549
00:37:59.911 --> 00:38:01.514
Fuck!

550
00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:02.848
Oh. fuck.

551
00:38:02.914 --> 00:38:04.417
- Anybody hit?
- No. I'm good.

552
00:38:05.116 --> 00:38:06.385
Some gun!

553
00:38:13.091 --> 00:38:16.729
- If that was a branch breakin'. it fell off a Mauser tree.
- You sure?

554
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:19.298
That was a shot.
Of course with this one.

555
00:38:19.365 --> 00:38:20.800
I'd know what the
fuckin' bullet sounds like.

556
00:38:21.434 --> 00:38:23.001
It was far away.
a long way away. right?

557
00:38:23.067 --> 00:38:24.303
Yeah. tell yourself
whatever you want.

558
00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:26.037
I can't tell this
as this height.

559
00:38:26.104 --> 00:38:28.340
Sound carries farther the higher you
go. doesn't it?

560
00:38:31.009 --> 00:38:32.311
Fuck.

561
00:38:32.378 --> 00:38:34.447
What the hell?
What the fuckin' hell?

562
00:38:38.116 --> 00:38:40.018
We're goin' up the brow.
the Devil himself.

563
00:38:40.084 --> 00:38:42.020
One more word from you like that.
Joyner. I'll shoot you myself.

564
00:38:42.086 --> 00:38:43.823
Hey. fuck you. Marson. okay?

565
00:38:44.557 --> 00:38:46.292
By all the rights.
I should be in charge anyway.

566
00:38:47.058 --> 00:38:48.461
If it wasn't for your
college degree.

567
00:38:50.229 --> 00:38:52.063
Mussolini here has
led us to our deaths.

568
00:38:53.632 --> 00:38:55.434
Shut up! Okay.

569
00:38:55.501 --> 00:38:56.735
He has not.

570
00:38:56.802 --> 00:38:58.204
And Marson's in charge.

571
00:38:58.270 --> 00:39:00.206
This is all fucked!

572
00:39:06.812 --> 00:39:08.314
- This is all fucked!
- Okay.

573
00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:09.448
Okay.

574
00:39:09.515 --> 00:39:11.617
Here's what we're gonna do.

575
00:39:11.684 --> 00:39:14.118
- I'm gonna get up really slowly and we're gonna start movin'.
- Yeah.

576
00:39:14.186 --> 00:39:16.087
- Keep your eyes up. all right?
- Hell. yeah.

577
00:39:16.922 --> 00:39:18.424
Here we go.

578
00:40:06.272 --> 00:40:07.540
Over there.

579
00:40:07.606 --> 00:40:09.408
It's a party.

580
00:40:10.776 --> 00:40:11.810
Cover me.

581
00:40:45.144 --> 00:40:46.745
What the fuck?

582
00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:56.822
Peace. Soul.

583
00:40:57.823 --> 00:40:59.525
<i>Maybe Tedeski.</i>

584
00:41:00.392 --> 00:41:02.828
Have soul. I hope.

585
00:41:02.895 --> 00:41:04.363
That's just like Shaw.

586
00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:05.831
Look at the wound.

587
00:41:05.898 --> 00:41:08.367
I want off
this fuckin' mountain.

588
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:11.604
This whole thing is fucked.

589
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:14.440
Fire's still burning.
There's footprints all around.

590
00:41:15.441 --> 00:41:16.775
The Germans did it.

591
00:41:16.842 --> 00:41:18.177
Why shoot their own guy?

592
00:41:18.243 --> 00:41:20.245
Desertion.

593
00:41:21.313 --> 00:41:23.282
They're not trying to hide
that they're here.

594
00:41:25.584 --> 00:41:27.086
Either they're running or...

595
00:41:27.152 --> 00:41:28.654
they don't know we're here.

596
00:41:28.721 --> 00:41:30.623
Or... they're leading us
into a trap.

597
00:41:32.157 --> 00:41:33.425
<i>Tedesco.</i>

598
00:41:36.362 --> 00:41:38.263
<i>Si. Tedesco.</i>

599
00:41:41.333 --> 00:41:42.568
The fuck you saying to him?

600
00:41:43.402 --> 00:41:46.472
- Word means "German."
- Well. do us a favor and talk English. will ya?

601
00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:48.841
Fuck.

602
00:41:50.776 --> 00:41:52.811
Take it easy.
It's just a wolf calling.

603
00:41:57.282 --> 00:41:59.451
They're laughing at us.

604
00:42:24.376 --> 00:42:26.311
It's just a wolf calling.

605
00:42:31.417 --> 00:42:33.585
We didn't see any
tracks leading in here.

606
00:42:34.286 --> 00:42:35.854
We made contact.

607
00:42:37.456 --> 00:42:40.592
Which means we can turn around and
start making our way off this fucker.

608
00:42:41.727 --> 00:42:43.228
How many men you think.
Asch?

609
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:46.565
I don't know.

610
00:42:46.632 --> 00:42:50.202
- Ten?
- Way more than ten if you ask me.

611
00:42:50.869 --> 00:42:52.705
Think they
knew we were coming?

612
00:42:53.939 --> 00:42:56.308
What exactly are you
suggesting we do?

613
00:42:57.109 --> 00:43:00.112
They don't know about us
so they don't care about us.

614
00:43:00.579 --> 00:43:02.548
I don't think they know.

615
00:43:04.817 --> 00:43:05.918
We'll wait a little bit.

616
00:43:06.452 --> 00:43:08.188
If they're running.
we'll give them a little head start.

617
00:43:08.253 --> 00:43:10.122
And if they come back.
we'll be ready for them.

618
00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:11.924
Christ. you don't think
they're gonna come back. do you?

619
00:43:17.229 --> 00:43:18.931
Keep your eyes up.

620
00:43:23.936 --> 00:43:28.273
It blew like this in Africa.
Except it was sand.

621
00:43:28.974 --> 00:43:30.609
I'd rather have the sand.

622
00:43:32.077 --> 00:43:34.079
I prefer the sand.

623
00:43:41.854 --> 00:43:43.989
I made up my mind.
I'm reportin' what happened.

624
00:43:44.056 --> 00:43:46.091
Christ. Once again.
Mr. Broken Record.

625
00:43:46.159 --> 00:43:48.560
I'm reportin' it.
That's all I'm sayin'.

626
00:43:48.927 --> 00:43:50.796
Can't go the rest of my life
carryin' this.

627
00:43:51.363 --> 00:43:53.465
What made you the moral compass
of the fuckin' Fifth Army?

628
00:43:53.532 --> 00:43:54.800
The sergeant did.

629
00:43:54.867 --> 00:43:56.902
The minute that he
shot that girl...

630
00:43:56.969 --> 00:43:58.704
I say we talk about it when we get down.
We're not there yet.

631
00:43:59.905 --> 00:44:01.473
I'll come with you
when the time comes.

632
00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:03.475
Jesus. you're both fucked.

633
00:44:04.676 --> 00:44:06.912
Need I remind you that
two of our guys got it

634
00:44:06.979 --> 00:44:08.413
when her lover jumped out
of that cart.

635
00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:11.151
Yeah. she didn't do
the shooting.

636
00:44:11.217 --> 00:44:12.851
She was a fuckin' Nazi.

637
00:44:13.519 --> 00:44:15.554
They don't like Jews.

638
00:44:19.591 --> 00:44:21.059
It's your people.
isn't it?

639
00:44:26.732 --> 00:44:28.700
You know what. Joyner?

640
00:44:30.536 --> 00:44:32.337
You're a Nazi.

641
00:44:39.044 --> 00:44:40.479
Say that again.

642
00:44:41.113 --> 00:44:42.447
You're...

643
00:44:42.781 --> 00:44:44.049
a Nazi.

644
00:44:44.116 --> 00:44:45.484
Say that again. you
little piece of shit.

645
00:44:45.551 --> 00:44:46.919
You're a fuckin' Nazi.

646
00:44:46.985 --> 00:44:48.720
Stop it! Stop it!

647
00:44:48.787 --> 00:44:50.223
Back the fuck off.
Joyner!

648
00:44:50.689 --> 00:44:52.057
Not one more inch. Joyner.
You hear me?

649
00:44:52.124 --> 00:44:53.892
Get your fuckin' finger
out of my face.

650
00:44:53.959 --> 00:44:55.060
I mean it!

651
00:45:05.971 --> 00:45:08.540
'Cause otherwise.
we're no different than they are.

652
00:45:08.607 --> 00:45:10.409
You gotta have
the last word. don't ya?

653
00:45:10.742 --> 00:45:12.611
Take it away. asshole!

654
00:45:23.055 --> 00:45:24.590
I'm not sweatin' it...

655
00:45:25.023 --> 00:45:27.659
I'm gonna tear my fuckin' skin
off. cut it away.

656
00:45:34.766 --> 00:45:36.368
Bah!

657
00:45:39.272 --> 00:45:41.874
You know more English
than you're lettin' on. huh?

658
00:45:44.277 --> 00:45:45.577
I bet you know what's on
the other side

659
00:45:45.644 --> 00:45:47.280
of this mountain we're
trying to fuckin' climb.

660
00:45:47.347 --> 00:45:48.447
We know what's on the
other side of the mountain.

661
00:45:48.513 --> 00:45:49.915
it's a fuckin' war!

662
00:45:49.982 --> 00:45:51.617
I'm just sayin' we shouldn't
trust him.

663
00:45:53.452 --> 00:45:55.587
I do for my country.

664
00:45:57.856 --> 00:46:00.125
I've only known
they made it out of shit.

665
00:46:01.361 --> 00:46:02.694
Yeah.

666
00:46:06.031 --> 00:46:08.500
You realize this guy could
be part of the Axis. right?

667
00:46:09.601 --> 00:46:12.638
He's at least. what? 65?

668
00:46:13.472 --> 00:46:15.174
Which means he was around
for Albania.

669
00:46:15.241 --> 00:46:17.210
And all of the Africa stuff
at the beginning.

670
00:46:17.277 --> 00:46:19.044
Ethiopia. All that.

671
00:46:19.111 --> 00:46:20.812
"Ethiopia"? What the fuck are
you talkin' about. Joyner?

672
00:46:20.879 --> 00:46:22.748
This shit goes back
ten years or more. man.

673
00:46:22.814 --> 00:46:25.651
These guys have been
fighting for a long time.

674
00:46:26.618 --> 00:46:28.687
I'm sure some of them
are sick of it.

675
00:46:30.156 --> 00:46:31.490
I...

676
00:46:32.392 --> 00:46:34.026
had a family.

677
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:40.166
<i>Tutti morti.</i>

678
00:46:42.768 --> 00:46:43.802
Dead.

679
00:46:57.916 --> 00:46:59.218
Jesus.

680
00:47:00.452 --> 00:47:01.720
Why don't we send up a flare

681
00:47:01.787 --> 00:47:03.156
and sing the
"Star Spangled Banner"?

682
00:47:14.233 --> 00:47:15.567
Shit.

683
00:47:20.239 --> 00:47:21.540
Near.

684
00:47:23.108 --> 00:47:25.411
Jesus. If he says that
one more fuckin' time

685
00:47:25.477 --> 00:47:26.878
I'm gonna shoot him myself.

686
00:47:32.551 --> 00:47:34.019
What the hell was that?

687
00:47:36.289 --> 00:47:37.622
Planes?

688
00:47:40.025 --> 00:47:41.560
No. tanks.

689
00:47:42.127 --> 00:47:43.495
Christ. Up here?!

690
00:47:43.562 --> 00:47:45.597
<i>- Si.
- Near?</i>

691
00:47:45.664 --> 00:47:46.898
<i>Si.</i>

692
00:47:51.337 --> 00:47:52.305
God.

693
00:47:52.372 --> 00:47:53.905
Let's go. Asch.

694
00:48:50.829 --> 00:48:52.165
- Asch. help him!
- All right.

695
00:48:52.231 --> 00:48:53.899
Joyner. get up!

696
00:48:53.965 --> 00:48:56.101
What the fuck are you doing?

697
00:48:56.169 --> 00:48:57.969
Joyner!

698
00:48:58.837 --> 00:49:00.906
Joyner. get your shit.
take your gear. let's go!

699
00:49:00.972 --> 00:49:01.773
Shoot me!

700
00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:03.108
Asch. help him!

701
00:49:03.176 --> 00:49:04.643
Shoot me.

702
00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:07.979
Shoot me.

703
00:49:15.455 --> 00:49:16.721
For Christ's sweet sake.

704
00:49:16.788 --> 00:49:18.257
Joyner. come on.

705
00:49:19.325 --> 00:49:20.926
Gotta get off this fucker.

706
00:49:21.561 --> 00:49:24.663
- This is shit. This fuckin' shit.
- Get your weapon.

707
00:49:24.729 --> 00:49:26.332
We gotta get off this
fuckin' mountain.

708
00:49:26.399 --> 00:49:28.066
It's a terrible place.

709
00:49:29.368 --> 00:49:31.036
Joyner.

710
00:49:31.103 --> 00:49:32.838
Hey. Hey. Benny.

711
00:49:32.904 --> 00:49:34.574
Let's just finish this.

712
00:49:34.639 --> 00:49:36.209
And get back. Okay?

713
00:49:36.275 --> 00:49:38.377
Come on. Let's go.

714
00:49:39.845 --> 00:49:41.880
Come on. Come on.

715
00:50:06.506 --> 00:50:08.141
Joyner!

716
00:50:13.778 --> 00:50:15.248
I wanna go home.

717
00:50:17.883 --> 00:50:20.685
Joyner. we're goin' on.

718
00:50:27.293 --> 00:50:29.228
Okay?

719
00:50:30.563 --> 00:50:32.231
Let's go.

720
00:50:32.298 --> 00:50:33.732
Come on.

721
00:50:33.798 --> 00:50:36.768
Okay? Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

722
00:50:37.603 --> 00:50:39.738
<i>Capisce? Capisce!
Come on.</i>

723
00:50:39.804 --> 00:50:41.072
Let's go.

724
00:52:08.893 --> 00:52:10.363
Your village?

725
00:52:13.733 --> 00:52:15.767
<i>Si. Mio village.</i>

726
00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:25.777
<i>Amici.</i>

727
00:52:27.213 --> 00:52:28.247
Friends?

728
00:52:29.215 --> 00:52:30.249
<i>Si.</i>

729
00:52:35.321 --> 00:52:36.489
Corporal.

730
00:52:49.268 --> 00:52:51.970
It's a fucking firing squad.

731
00:52:54.273 --> 00:52:56.409
What are you gonna
report now?

732
00:52:57.876 --> 00:52:59.545
I'm gonna report a murder.

733
00:53:01.213 --> 00:53:04.150
- Even after this?
- Yeah. especially after this.

734
00:53:04.216 --> 00:53:05.351
damn it.

735
00:53:07.952 --> 00:53:10.423
Maybe the soldiers...

736
00:53:10.855 --> 00:53:13.392
- are executing members of the resistance.
- No.

737
00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:16.595
Shooting innocent.

738
00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:28.507
Oh. God.

739
00:53:39.785 --> 00:53:41.454
This is worse.

740
00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.255
The silence.

741
00:53:56.202 --> 00:53:57.803
They're gonna attack.

742
00:53:58.437 --> 00:53:59.904
Yeah. no more babies to kill.

743
00:53:59.971 --> 00:54:01.906
Might as well take on
the big boys.

744
00:54:01.973 --> 00:54:03.908
We gotta move.

745
00:54:04.677 --> 00:54:06.512
I can't fuckin' believe this.

746
00:54:06.579 --> 00:54:08.147
Any of this bullshit.

747
00:54:08.214 --> 00:54:10.282
All fuckin' offensive.

748
00:54:16.155 --> 00:54:17.256
What's that for?

749
00:54:17.323 --> 00:54:18.923
So the dead know we're here.

750
00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:20.259
Let's move out.

751
00:54:20.326 --> 00:54:22.127
Let's get the fuck out of here.

752
00:54:46.218 --> 00:54:47.653
You know. Corporal.

753
00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:49.221
maybe Reece...

754
00:54:54.794 --> 00:54:56.228
Where'd it come from?!

755
00:54:56.796 --> 00:54:57.830
I don't know!

756
00:54:57.897 --> 00:54:59.565
The kick-behind is way off!

757
00:54:59.632 --> 00:55:01.065
A sniper?!

758
00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:04.002
It's a sniper!

759
00:55:05.003 --> 00:55:06.272
You sure?!

760
00:55:07.339 --> 00:55:08.940
Stay out until
at least they saw!

761
00:55:09.007 --> 00:55:11.075
- Don't you move!
- Why?!

762
00:55:11.143 --> 00:55:12.977
If he knows you're alive.
he'll shoot you again!

763
00:55:13.044 --> 00:55:14.914
Fuck. Oh. shit.

764
00:55:14.979 --> 00:55:16.882
There's somebody behind me.

765
00:55:16.981 --> 00:55:18.217
I hear footsteps.

766
00:55:18.284 --> 00:55:19.585
You heard nothing!

767
00:55:19.652 --> 00:55:21.153
What if they're working
their way around us?

768
00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:22.354
They're not working
their way around!

769
00:55:22.421 --> 00:55:24.623
There's only been one shot!

770
00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:26.292
Which means it's a sniper!

771
00:55:27.159 --> 00:55:29.628
<i>Si. Un cecchino.</i>

772
00:55:36.335 --> 00:55:38.270
Okay. I'm coming for you.
so you take it easy. all right...?

773
00:55:38.337 --> 00:55:40.739
No. no. no. no. no. Corporal.
they'll be out there waiting for you!

774
00:55:40.806 --> 00:55:42.040
I'm not gonna leave him!

775
00:55:42.106 --> 00:55:44.008
Hey. fuck you!
I didn't say that!

776
00:55:45.611 --> 00:55:46.679
Saul!

777
00:55:48.079 --> 00:55:49.849
Okay. Asch. you ready?
I'm comin' for you.

778
00:55:49.915 --> 00:55:51.283
Okay!

779
00:55:51.350 --> 00:55:52.685
Joyner. you cover me.
all right?!

780
00:55:52.751 --> 00:55:53.953
I'm makin' a move!

781
00:55:54.018 --> 00:55:55.086
He saw what he saw.

782
00:55:55.154 --> 00:55:56.489
You cover me!

783
00:55:56.555 --> 00:55:58.591
He's been watching us
this whole time.

784
00:55:58.657 --> 00:56:00.226
Cover me. Joyner!

785
00:56:01.827 --> 00:56:03.762
All right. fuck!
All right.

786
00:56:06.732 --> 00:56:07.967
Covering fire!

787
00:56:08.032 --> 00:56:09.468
Moving!

788
00:56:12.338 --> 00:56:13.472
Run!

789
00:56:14.974 --> 00:56:16.475
- Saul!
- Shit!

790
00:56:17.877 --> 00:56:19.512
Fuck!

791
00:56:19.578 --> 00:56:20.746
Move!

792
00:56:21.614 --> 00:56:24.283
I can't feel my
fuckin' leg.

793
00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:29.388
You know I can just
leave you here. right?

794
00:56:37.396 --> 00:56:39.532
Come on. Joyner...

795
00:56:47.973 --> 00:56:49.408
How's it lookin'?

796
00:56:56.549 --> 00:56:57.283
Oh. shit!

797
00:56:57.349 --> 00:56:58.884
It's okay. it's okay.

798
00:56:58.951 --> 00:57:01.287
Breathe. breathe. breathe.

799
00:57:03.556 --> 00:57:04.723
Is it bad?

800
00:57:05.824 --> 00:57:08.126
- No. million dollar wound.
- Don't bullshit me.

801
00:57:15.367 --> 00:57:16.902
Through and through.

802
00:57:16.969 --> 00:57:18.904
You're gonna be okay.
I don't think it hit any bone.

803
00:57:18.971 --> 00:57:20.539
Okay? It's gonna be okay.

804
00:57:20.606 --> 00:57:22.575
- You're gonna be okay.
- Okay.

805
00:57:22.942 --> 00:57:24.376
- Okay. do me a favor.
- Yeah.

806
00:57:24.443 --> 00:57:25.911
Put your hands here.
Keep pressure on there.

807
00:57:25.978 --> 00:57:27.546
Keep pressure on there.
Don't take that off.

808
00:57:27.613 --> 00:57:29.715
- Okay?!
- I'm freezin'.

809
00:57:29.782 --> 00:57:31.050
It's so fuckin' cold.

810
00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:34.320
Oh. Shit. it's not stoppin'.

811
00:57:34.386 --> 00:57:35.788
- It's stoppin'.
- I'm emptyin' out.

812
00:57:35.854 --> 00:57:37.556
Move your hands. move your
hands. move your hands.

813
00:57:39.959 --> 00:57:41.160
It's okay.

814
00:57:41.827 --> 00:57:43.596
- It's okay. here we go. here we go.
- I didn't do anythin'.

815
00:57:44.196 --> 00:57:46.465
I'm a good guy.
I never hurt nobody on purpose. I swear.

816
00:57:46.532 --> 00:57:47.933
- Hey. hey. hey...
- I got...

817
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.368
- Hey. look at me!
- Mm-hmm.

818
00:57:49.435 --> 00:57:50.936
It's gonna be okay. all right?

819
00:57:51.003 --> 00:57:52.338
We're gonna patch you up.

820
00:57:52.404 --> 00:57:53.472
We're gonna get you off
this mountain.

821
00:57:53.539 --> 00:57:55.040
And out of this fuckin' war.

822
00:57:55.106 --> 00:57:56.575
- Okay?
- Okay.

823
00:57:56.642 --> 00:57:58.477
- I'm scared.
- It's okay. it's okay.

824
00:57:58.544 --> 00:58:00.111
- This is bad. isn't it?
- No. it's not. It's stopping.

825
00:58:00.179 --> 00:58:02.648
It's stopping

826
00:58:02.715 --> 00:58:03.882
It's cold.

827
00:58:03.949 --> 00:58:05.618
Cold is good.
It's a good sign.

828
00:58:05.684 --> 00:58:06.952
No. it's bad.

829
00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:10.322
Give me some...
I need something for the pain.

830
00:58:10.389 --> 00:58:11.857
- Just give me something...
- Okay. okay. okay.

831
00:58:19.898 --> 00:58:21.467
Shh...

832
00:58:25.904 --> 00:58:27.339
Give me another one.

833
00:58:35.047 --> 00:58:36.315
Oh. it hit me...

834
00:58:38.651 --> 00:58:41.754
I didn't mean anything...
I'm sorry for the noise.

835
00:58:42.988 --> 00:58:45.157
You're gettin' out of this war.
you lucky son of a bitch.

836
00:58:45.858 --> 00:58:47.793
Look. Benny.
there's so much blood.

837
00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:49.328
Yeah. well...

838
00:58:49.395 --> 00:58:52.132
You've got gallons of it.
There's enough. you know?

839
00:58:52.197 --> 00:58:54.066
Benny. I got it all over me.

840
00:58:54.134 --> 00:58:55.834
It's okay. Hmm?

841
00:58:55.901 --> 00:58:57.436
You ever donate blood?

842
00:58:57.503 --> 00:58:58.904
You take a vial of that.
you spill it on the floor.

843
00:58:58.971 --> 00:58:59.938
it looks exactly like that.

844
00:59:01.473 --> 00:59:03.375
We were screwed from the...

845
00:59:04.243 --> 00:59:05.477
from the beginning.

846
00:59:06.211 --> 00:59:07.880
Got your blanket here.

847
00:59:07.946 --> 00:59:10.282
It's okay. Jump in there.

848
00:59:11.450 --> 00:59:12.785
There you go.

849
00:59:12.851 --> 00:59:14.553
- Joyner.
- Yeah?

850
00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:17.356
Joyner. I can't feel my legs.

851
00:59:17.856 --> 00:59:19.058
I can't move my legs.

852
00:59:19.124 --> 00:59:20.659
- Can you feel that?
- Feel what?

853
00:59:23.295 --> 00:59:25.230
I can't feel my legs.

854
00:59:25.297 --> 00:59:26.732
Christ.

855
00:59:31.603 --> 00:59:33.739
It'll go away. it'll go away.
okay?

856
00:59:33.806 --> 00:59:35.407
Soon as we get your
blood pressure back up.

857
00:59:35.474 --> 00:59:37.443
- it's gonna come back. okay?
- Okay.

858
00:59:38.210 --> 00:59:39.745
Where's the toothpaste?

859
00:59:40.679 --> 00:59:43.382
Somebody
took the toothpaste.

860
00:59:47.252 --> 00:59:48.854
I got it. buddy.

861
00:59:49.221 --> 00:59:50.522
- You got it.
- Yeah.

862
00:59:50.589 --> 00:59:52.858
- Yeah! You're a good brother.
- Yeah.

863
00:59:52.925 --> 00:59:55.394
You're a good brother.

864
00:59:56.829 --> 00:59:59.765
I should've given you
a baseball glove.

865
01:00:02.101 --> 01:00:04.336
Don't worry about it. okay?

866
01:00:04.403 --> 01:00:06.004
You should've seen
the things I saw.

867
01:00:06.071 --> 01:00:07.506
That's her...

868
01:00:09.041 --> 01:00:10.576
I can't... breathe...

869
01:00:11.243 --> 01:00:12.344
It's okay.

870
01:00:12.411 --> 01:00:14.012
It's okay.

871
01:00:14.546 --> 01:00:16.216
- Shh.
- Shh.

872
01:00:16.281 --> 01:00:17.850
Breathe.

873
01:00:24.089 --> 01:00:26.425
I don't know if there's any
internal bleeding.

874
01:00:27.025 --> 01:00:28.894
Bullet might've perforated
his bowel.

875
01:00:28.961 --> 01:00:30.230
Father...

876
01:00:30.295 --> 01:00:31.830
Father...

877
01:00:34.466 --> 01:00:36.502
- Father...
- We gotta move him.

878
01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:40.806
- Okay. okay. I'll carry him.
- No.

879
01:00:46.812 --> 01:00:47.913
No. he's mine.

880
01:00:49.581 --> 01:00:51.350
Put your hat on. okay?

881
01:00:51.984 --> 01:00:53.285
- I'll sit you up. okay?
- Okay.

882
01:00:53.352 --> 01:00:55.454
You ready? Three... two...

883
01:00:55.521 --> 01:00:56.922
One. There we go.

884
01:00:56.989 --> 01:00:59.691
Get him. Three... two...

885
01:00:59.758 --> 01:01:01.593
Stand up. stand up. Okay.

886
01:01:02.494 --> 01:01:03.929
You're gonna be all
right. buddy.

887
01:01:03.996 --> 01:01:05.864
Keep going. I got the stuff.
Go. go. go.

888
01:01:08.367 --> 01:01:09.735
Let's go.

889
01:02:15.235 --> 01:02:16.735
Okay. buddy.

890
01:02:22.242 --> 01:02:23.809
There you go.

891
01:02:24.776 --> 01:02:27.045
You know you can pick us off
at any time. right?

892
01:02:27.112 --> 01:02:27.980
They sent stragglers.

893
01:02:28.046 --> 01:02:29.148
Maybe he shot once

894
01:02:29.215 --> 01:02:30.283
and it went over
through a tree.

895
01:02:30.350 --> 01:02:31.483
Yeah.

896
01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:33.552
Or he could be fuckin'
huntin' us.

897
01:02:37.257 --> 01:02:38.557
It's not so bad.

898
01:02:39.325 --> 01:02:40.592
The cold.

899
01:02:42.161 --> 01:02:43.662
And the wind's not blowin'.

900
01:02:52.771 --> 01:02:54.439
There's somethin' out there.

901
01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:56.642
<i>There's someone you mean.</i>

902
01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:03.249
Hey.

903
01:03:03.916 --> 01:03:06.685
Why don't we set the Kraut up
as one of us with a rifle?

904
01:03:08.453 --> 01:03:10.088
You know. like. prop him up
against the tree or somethin'?

905
01:03:11.456 --> 01:03:14.059
That way if the sniper's on our tail.
he might take a pop at the dead guy.

906
01:03:14.493 --> 01:03:16.061
Give us a warning.

907
01:03:17.330 --> 01:03:19.165
Got no one to cover us.

908
01:03:19.698 --> 01:03:21.500
You really want to take
that chance?

909
01:03:24.603 --> 01:03:26.205
If I can get rid of
the feeling

910
01:03:26.638 --> 01:03:29.808
that somebody's put a bead on me the
whole way down this fuckin' mountain.

911
01:03:31.244 --> 01:03:32.477
Then yeah.

912
01:03:32.678 --> 01:03:34.780
Fuck yeah. I want to
take the chance.

913
01:03:35.381 --> 01:03:36.648
- Okay.
- Yeah?

914
01:03:36.715 --> 01:03:38.617
Okay.

915
01:03:41.486 --> 01:03:43.055
Angelo!

916
01:03:43.121 --> 01:03:44.489
Get down!

917
01:03:45.057 --> 01:03:46.192
Oh.

918
01:03:46.259 --> 01:03:47.492
Hey. buddy.

919
01:03:47.559 --> 01:03:49.695
Hey. okay. There you go.

920
01:03:49.761 --> 01:03:51.397
-Now. now. now. yeah.

921
01:03:51.463 --> 01:03:53.199
We're setting up a decoy.
Not yet. buddy.

922
01:03:53.799 --> 01:03:55.067
Huh?

923
01:03:55.534 --> 01:03:57.236
I'm bleedin'. okay?

924
01:03:57.337 --> 01:04:00.340
- Inside. I can feel it.
- No. Your imagination.

925
01:04:00.406 --> 01:04:01.673
- No.
- You're fine.

926
01:04:02.275 --> 01:04:03.742
Final push.

927
01:04:03.809 --> 01:04:05.577
Then get you out here. okay?

928
01:04:05.644 --> 01:04:07.447
I'll carry you myself.

929
01:04:07.512 --> 01:04:08.747
Get you home.

930
01:04:08.814 --> 01:04:10.916
Have a nice fuckin' beer.

931
01:04:10.983 --> 01:04:12.985
Go for a burger. All that shit.

932
01:04:13.051 --> 01:04:15.020
Can you eat meat? You people eat meat?

933
01:04:15.087 --> 01:04:17.290
- A steak? Can you do that?
- Is it kosher?

934
01:04:20.692 --> 01:04:21.893
It's all good.

935
01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:24.230
- It's gonna be fine. okay?
- Okay.

936
01:04:58.231 --> 01:04:59.931
What do you think?

937
01:05:00.699 --> 01:05:03.769
Yeah... maybe.

938
01:05:04.536 --> 01:05:06.104
From far away?

939
01:05:07.173 --> 01:05:08.341
I guess.

940
01:05:12.178 --> 01:05:13.346
Fuck.

941
01:05:14.046 --> 01:05:16.315
He looks like a fuckin' stiff
tied to a tree.

942
01:05:16.382 --> 01:05:17.916
- It was your idea.
- I know!

943
01:05:21.653 --> 01:05:23.289
Maybe from a distance.

944
01:05:25.057 --> 01:05:27.025
Looks like a fuckin' mannequin.

945
01:05:34.933 --> 01:05:37.537
We... no time. We hurry.

946
01:05:37.602 --> 01:05:39.938
Saliva's gathering at
the back of his throat.

947
01:05:42.074 --> 01:05:43.209
We gotta move him.

948
01:05:46.044 --> 01:05:47.180
You go.

949
01:05:48.847 --> 01:05:50.715
I'm gonna stay
and get this bastard.

950
01:05:51.883 --> 01:05:53.852
No. We get down
off this fucker.

951
01:05:53.919 --> 01:05:55.887
- All of us. together...
- We don't have any time.

952
01:05:55.954 --> 01:05:58.424
He's gonna get us on the way
down. one by one. and you know it.

953
01:05:58.491 --> 01:05:59.559
We don't know that.

954
01:06:00.159 --> 01:06:01.626
Let Angelo take you down.
don't you stop for a second.

955
01:06:01.693 --> 01:06:04.363
And. Joyner. get him home.

956
01:06:07.567 --> 01:06:09.402
I got a bad feelin'.

957
01:06:09.469 --> 01:06:11.703
You always got a bad feeling.

958
01:06:12.305 --> 01:06:13.672
Fuck you. too. Corporal.

959
01:07:50.702 --> 01:07:52.837
There's something
you need to know.

960
01:07:54.407 --> 01:07:55.641
If you do anything...

961
01:07:56.275 --> 01:07:58.743
that'll lead your German
buddies here to us.

962
01:07:59.245 --> 01:08:01.079
I'll fuckin' kill you myself...

963
01:08:01.147 --> 01:08:03.782
Before I ever take a shot
at them.

964
01:08:05.917 --> 01:08:07.286
Understand?

965
01:08:08.853 --> 01:08:11.122
I... got you.

966
01:08:11.756 --> 01:08:13.226
- You trust me.
- No.

967
01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:15.927
I don't trust you.

968
01:08:16.629 --> 01:08:18.130
I said it from the start.

969
01:08:31.344 --> 01:08:33.044
You hate us. don't you?

970
01:08:34.447 --> 01:08:36.148
You fascist pig.

971
01:09:06.044 --> 01:09:08.079
<i>No. grazie.</i>

972
01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:22.568
A kid?

973
01:13:24.837 --> 01:13:26.338
A thief?!

974
01:13:27.573 --> 01:13:30.242
What the hell
is wrong with you?

975
01:13:30.976 --> 01:13:33.445
What the hell
is wrong with you?

976
01:13:50.796 --> 01:13:52.498
You motherfucker.

977
01:14:04.944 --> 01:14:06.178
Marson!

978
01:14:06.812 --> 01:14:08.514
Jesus fuckin' Christ!

979
01:14:08.581 --> 01:14:10.215
Why haven't you gone
further than this?

980
01:14:10.282 --> 01:14:12.651
Saul woke up and got sick.
I couldn't move him.

981
01:14:13.852 --> 01:14:15.287
I hear the shot.

982
01:14:17.156 --> 01:14:18.524
You got him?

983
01:14:19.992 --> 01:14:21.660
It wasn't a Gerry.

984
01:14:21.961 --> 01:14:23.162
What?

985
01:14:23.596 --> 01:14:25.297
It was an Italian.

986
01:14:29.134 --> 01:14:30.603
Italian?

987
01:14:31.637 --> 01:14:34.173
Italiano from your village.
huh?!

988
01:14:40.779 --> 01:14:42.414
A... bastard.

989
01:14:43.482 --> 01:14:44.850
Yeah.

990
01:14:55.194 --> 01:14:56.762
Okay. come on. come on.

991
01:15:02.267 --> 01:15:03.802
A thief.

992
01:15:04.236 --> 01:15:06.171
I can't figure it.

993
01:15:07.873 --> 01:15:10.776
The Germans paid a
heavy price for our heads.

994
01:15:10.843 --> 01:15:12.845
He's a survivor.

995
01:15:12.911 --> 01:15:14.546
Just like us.

996
01:15:14.613 --> 01:15:16.382
Where are we?!

997
01:15:16.448 --> 01:15:18.550
We're almost there. buddy.

998
01:15:18.617 --> 01:15:20.886
- We're almost there.
- I'm dead.

999
01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:23.856
I can feel the blood
going out of me.

1000
01:15:23.922 --> 01:15:25.791
No. you're not.
You're just imagining it. all right?

1001
01:15:25.858 --> 01:15:29.261
No. I... I don't have
an imagination anymore.

1002
01:15:29.328 --> 01:15:30.663
I'm all facts.

1003
01:15:32.197 --> 01:15:33.699
Ask me anything.

1004
01:15:34.233 --> 01:15:35.934
Ask me if I'm gonna die.

1005
01:15:36.001 --> 01:15:37.903
You're not gonna die.
Save your strength.

1006
01:15:37.970 --> 01:15:39.672
We're almost there.
We'll make it. you'll see.

1007
01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:44.144
Do you ever go to
serials back home?

1008
01:15:44.209 --> 01:15:46.412
- Movie houses?
- Yup.

1009
01:15:46.478 --> 01:15:48.781
Saturday matinee.

1010
01:15:49.948 --> 01:15:51.617
All day for a nickel.

1011
01:15:53.118 --> 01:15:54.787
I used to hate to wait

1012
01:15:54.853 --> 01:15:57.189
to see how it turned out.

1013
01:15:58.290 --> 01:16:00.826
- Last minute questions.
- All right.

1014
01:16:03.163 --> 01:16:05.364
Yeah. I shoulda been

1015
01:16:05.431 --> 01:16:08.200
Hey! Hey. Saul.

1016
01:16:08.767 --> 01:16:11.470
Marson got that son of a bitch
who shot you.

1017
01:16:14.106 --> 01:16:15.874
The son of a bitch
shot me...

1018
01:16:15.941 --> 01:16:17.810
Oh. he dead...

1019
01:16:18.410 --> 01:16:20.212
You know...

1020
01:16:21.181 --> 01:16:23.015
You know what that means?

1021
01:16:23.515 --> 01:16:26.518
That means...

1022
01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:30.622
Oh. I wish I was Catholic
sometimes.

1023
01:16:30.689 --> 01:16:32.324
I wish I
was Jewish sometimes.

1024
01:16:32.391 --> 01:16:34.693
You just make confession
and be happy.

1025
01:16:35.961 --> 01:16:38.198
I don't know where we're
gonna find a priest.

1026
01:16:38.263 --> 01:16:39.498
You...

1027
01:16:39.565 --> 01:16:42.768
You can't talk to any Catholic?

1028
01:16:42.835 --> 01:16:45.504
No. only baptism can make
anybody Catholic.

1029
01:16:45.571 --> 01:16:47.639
Ooh. I'm a sinner...

1030
01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:49.708
We all are.

1031
01:16:49.775 --> 01:16:53.445
You carried me the whole
way. Benny.

1032
01:16:54.214 --> 01:16:55.881
I'm so sorry.

1033
01:16:55.948 --> 01:16:57.850
I'm so sorry.

1034
01:16:57.916 --> 01:16:59.318
Yeah. me. too.

1035
01:17:00.819 --> 01:17:03.288
I wish I coulda
savored things more.

1036
01:17:03.355 --> 01:17:06.658
Yeah. well.
save your breath. okay?

1037
01:17:13.832 --> 01:17:15.135
Oh. it's...

1038
01:17:15.201 --> 01:17:17.736
It's blood. isn't it. fellas?

1039
01:17:18.103 --> 01:17:20.005
It's your imagination. buddy.

1040
01:17:20.072 --> 01:17:21.207
Okay?

1041
01:17:21.273 --> 01:17:22.808
Oh!

1042
01:17:26.411 --> 01:17:28.148
It's cold.

1043
01:17:28.214 --> 01:17:31.450
- It's real cold.
- The end of the fuckin' world.

1044
01:18:00.813 --> 01:18:02.548
Saul?

1045
01:18:04.049 --> 01:18:05.218
You pissed on me. man!

1046
01:18:05.285 --> 01:18:06.585
He's not breathing.

1047
01:18:06.652 --> 01:18:08.120
- What?
- He's not breathing!

1048
01:18:08.188 --> 01:18:09.222
Medic!

1049
01:18:09.289 --> 01:18:11.023
He's not breathing!

1050
01:18:14.194 --> 01:18:15.627
Medic!

1051
01:18:34.314 --> 01:18:35.681
Gone.

1052
01:18:45.624 --> 01:18:47.125
You son of a bitch!

1053
01:18:47.559 --> 01:18:50.662
Hey! Hey! That's enough!

1054
01:19:08.614 --> 01:19:10.649
You're all murderers.

1055
01:19:12.918 --> 01:19:15.621
Get him the hell
out of here.

1056
01:19:33.172 --> 01:19:35.641
Want to tell me what
happened. Corporal?

1057
01:19:39.379 --> 01:19:40.979
Sergeant Reece. sir.

1058
01:19:43.582 --> 01:19:45.050
He's a murderer.

1059
01:19:45.817 --> 01:19:47.387
He killed an innocent.

1060
01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:49.788
Sergeant Reece is dead.

1061
01:19:50.822 --> 01:19:52.624
Died an hour ago
from a wound.

1062
01:19:52.891 --> 01:19:55.827
Sniper shot him through
his throat.

1063
01:19:58.331 --> 01:19:59.965
Someone search
the old man.

1064
01:20:03.702 --> 01:20:05.837
Did you get
a view from up north?

1065
01:20:08.174 --> 01:20:10.876
Doesn't make a difference
anymore. does it?

1066
01:20:11.576 --> 01:20:13.346
What doesn't?

1067
01:20:13.413 --> 01:20:15.181
Who we tell.

1068
01:20:15.248 --> 01:20:18.050
Son. I have no idea what the
hell you're talking about.

1069
01:20:18.318 --> 01:20:21.187
Now pull yourself together
and tell me what you saw!

1070
01:20:32.998 --> 01:20:34.367
Counterattack.

1071
01:20:34.434 --> 01:20:35.867
Jesus Christ.

1072
01:20:35.934 --> 01:20:37.569
A large force
heading our way.

1073
01:20:37.636 --> 01:20:38.937
We found this on
him. sir.

1074
01:21:01.526 --> 01:21:03.095
You son of a bitch.

1075
01:21:08.167 --> 01:21:11.304
Take him into the woods down
by the river and shoot him.

1076
01:21:11.371 --> 01:21:12.904
What?!

1077
01:21:13.406 --> 01:21:15.274
- What?!
- You heard me.

1078
01:21:15.341 --> 01:21:16.608
No. sir.

1079
01:21:16.675 --> 01:21:18.910
Are you questioning me.
Corporal?

1080
01:21:19.511 --> 01:21:21.113
Sir. you can't mean it.

1081
01:21:22.348 --> 01:21:24.583
Two men from this outfit

1082
01:21:24.649 --> 01:21:26.818
were shot by a German officer.

1083
01:21:26.885 --> 01:21:29.422
Four others got it last night
by Italians

1084
01:21:29.489 --> 01:21:31.723
acting like people happy
to be liberated.

1085
01:21:32.791 --> 01:21:35.127
You lost men
to the same action.

1086
01:21:35.194 --> 01:21:37.163
Well. some of them
are still in this.

1087
01:21:37.230 --> 01:21:41.134
And this one is carrying around
scouting information on us.

1088
01:21:41.733 --> 01:21:45.070
These people know the penalty
for spying.

1089
01:21:46.738 --> 01:21:48.573
He got us where
we needed to go.

1090
01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:49.574
Yeah.

1091
01:21:49.641 --> 01:21:51.643
He kept his word.

1092
01:21:51.710 --> 01:21:55.614
Yeah. until we're overrun today and
he goes back to scouting for them.

1093
01:21:58.284 --> 01:22:00.319
Take care of it.

1094
01:22:03.722 --> 01:22:05.391
No. sir.

1095
01:22:06.124 --> 01:22:07.893
- He's not one of them. sir.
- Oh. Jesus Christ.

1096
01:22:07.959 --> 01:22:10.463
Are you gonna do this.
or do I have to?

1097
01:22:10.530 --> 01:22:13.332
- Stop. no...!
- Get your hands off me. Corporal!

1098
01:22:20.273 --> 01:22:21.673
I got him.

1099
01:22:23.675 --> 01:22:25.010
He's my prisoner.

1100
01:22:25.077 --> 01:22:27.346
Then take him into
the woods and do it.

1101
01:22:27.413 --> 01:22:28.880
Now.

1102
01:22:30.216 --> 01:22:31.317
Go.

1103
01:22:33.152 --> 01:22:35.754
Go! Go!

1104
01:22:45.630 --> 01:22:47.366
Move!

1105
01:22:53.439 --> 01:22:54.673
Stop.

1106
01:23:04.250 --> 01:23:06.219
You did this to yourself.

1107
01:23:13.392 --> 01:23:14.626
What?

1108
01:23:14.693 --> 01:23:18.697
You...
weep for the girl.

1109
01:23:20.832 --> 01:23:23.668
You... feel...

1110
01:23:26.705 --> 01:23:28.374
Sin.

1111
01:23:33.778 --> 01:23:36.014
We all sinners.

1112
01:23:38.184 --> 01:23:39.885
I...

1113
01:23:40.986 --> 01:23:43.222
I pray for you.

1114
01:23:45.158 --> 01:23:46.425
<i>Ave Maria.</i>

1115
01:24:22.761 --> 01:24:25.198
I... I curse you!

1116
01:24:25.864 --> 01:24:26.965
You curse me?!

1117
01:24:27.032 --> 01:24:28.800
Yes! I curse you!

1118
01:24:29.067 --> 01:24:30.802
- You curse me?!
- I curse you!

1119
01:24:30.869 --> 01:24:32.037
- You curse me?!
- I curse you!

1120
01:24:32.103 --> 01:24:33.738
- You curse me?!
- I curse you!

1121
01:25:28.628 --> 01:25:30.363
My mama give me.

1122
01:25:31.564 --> 01:25:33.299
Long time ago.

1123
01:25:34.433 --> 01:25:36.335
Before she died.

1124
01:25:48.314 --> 01:25:49.848
Go!

1125
01:25:50.349 --> 01:25:51.950
Go!

1126
01:25:52.017 --> 01:25:53.985
Go!

1127
01:25:54.052 --> 01:25:56.255
Get the hell out of here!

1128
01:25:56.322 --> 01:25:58.056
Go!

1129
01:25:59.924 --> 01:26:02.194
Go before I change
my fucking mind!

1130
01:26:03.562 --> 01:26:05.331
You mother...

1131
01:26:06.599 --> 01:26:08.567
You mother...

1132
01:26:11.737 --> 01:26:13.805
You motherfucker.

1133
01:27:21.307 --> 01:27:22.907
Corporal.

1134
01:27:39.057 --> 01:27:41.260
I thought you were
supposed to kill him.

1135
01:27:44.430 --> 01:27:46.165
There's not much
a 70-year-old man

1136
01:27:46.232 --> 01:27:47.966
can do to change the war.

1137
01:27:58.977 --> 01:28:00.279
Hey.

1138
01:28:23.169 --> 01:28:24.570
Asch was right.

1139
01:28:28.407 --> 01:28:31.109
We were fucked the moment
we shot the whore.

1140
01:28:33.579 --> 01:28:36.449
You know they're gonna court-martial
you for this if they find out.

1141
01:28:46.225 --> 01:28:47.560
You hear that?

1142
01:28:50.896 --> 01:28:52.131
What?

1143
01:28:56.902 --> 01:28:59.271
It's peace.

1144
01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:02.274
Hey!

1145
01:29:04.643 --> 01:29:06.044
You're feeling okay?

1146
01:29:09.113 --> 01:29:10.649
What are you talking about?

1147
01:29:10.716 --> 01:29:12.451
All of this.

1148
01:29:12.952 --> 01:29:14.420
What?

1149
01:29:15.119 --> 01:29:16.622
All of this.

1150
01:29:26.064 --> 01:29:27.566
Hey.

1151
01:29:29.301 --> 01:29:31.270
You feeling all right?

1152
01:29:32.103 --> 01:29:33.104
Okay.

1153
01:29:33.172 --> 01:29:34.707
Okay. wait here. wait here.

1154
01:29:34.773 --> 01:29:36.742
Let me get somebody.

1155
01:29:55.194 --> 01:29:56.962
Corporal!

1156
01:29:57.028 --> 01:29:59.498
Let's go. we're movin' out!

1157
01:30:01.834 --> 01:30:04.003
<i>I wanted to
stay by that river...</i>

1158
01:30:04.670 --> 01:30:06.405
I'm not fuckin'
around. come on!

1159
01:30:06.472 --> 01:30:08.274
<i>Lie down...</i>

1160
01:30:09.675 --> 01:30:11.710
<i>And let the war go on
without me.</i>

1161
01:30:14.045 --> 01:30:16.215
<i>I had no prayers left to say.</i>

1162
01:30:20.252 --> 01:30:22.021
<i>But every moment after that...</i>

1163
01:30:23.054 --> 01:30:24.690
<i>for the rest of my life...</i>

1164
01:30:27.993 --> 01:30:29.495
<i>I would need to know...</i>

1165
01:30:32.765 --> 01:30:34.133
<i>Why?</i>

1166
01:30:36.354 --> 01:30:39.649
SIX MONTHS LATER
WHILE ON RECON PATROL

1167
01:30:39.858 --> 01:30:43.152
ROBERT MARSON WAS GRAVELY
WOUNDED BY A MORTAR ROUND.

1168
01:30:43.361 --> 01:30:46.614
THAT KILLED THE TWO MEN
HE WAS WITH INSTANTLY.

1169
01:30:48.324 --> 01:30:52.287
BLEEDING. HALF BLIND
AND BARELY CONSCIOUS

1170
01:30:52.495 --> 01:30:56.499
MARSON SAW A GERMAN SOLDIER
RUSHING TOWARDS HIM. RIFLE IN HAND

1171
01:30:56.708 --> 01:31:00.879
AND BELIEVING THIS WAS HIS DEATH ROBERT
MARSON BEGAN TO UTTER THE LORD'S PRAYER.

1172
01:31:03.715 --> 01:31:06.217
THE GERMAN. WEARY AND SICK OF THE WAR.

1173
01:31:06.426 --> 01:31:08.928
PROVED TO BE MARSON'S SAVIOR.

1174
01:31:09.137 --> 01:31:12.056
SURRENDERING AS HE CARRIED
THE INJURED AMERICAN

1175
01:31:12.265 --> 01:31:14.726
TO SAFETY ACROSS THE ALLIED LINES

1176
01:31:14.934 --> 01:31:18.354
UTTERING IN BROKEN ENGLISH FOUR
SIMPLE WORDS. "I HAVE HAD ENOUGH".
