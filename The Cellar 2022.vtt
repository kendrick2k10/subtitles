00:03:08.318 --> 00:03:11.974
-Is this all of ours?
-Yeah. it's all ours.

4
00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:20.417
Leave the door open.
The others are right behind us.

5
00:03:20.461 --> 00:03:22.811
-They're always so slow!
-Always slow.

6
00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:27.294
-Wow.
-That's it? Wow?

7
00:03:41.482 --> 00:03:43.266
I told you it was only
20 minutes away.

8
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.355
Yeah. by car. Mom.

9
00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:48.402
Do you ever try and see things
from someone else's perspective?

10
00:03:50.534 --> 00:03:51.883
Holy shit!

11
00:03:53.276 --> 00:03:55.060
Yeah. it's pretty impressive!

12
00:03:56.192 --> 00:03:58.107
No. Holy shit! It's so ugly.

13
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.722
Idiot!

14
00:04:14.515 --> 00:04:16.517
Mom!

15
00:04:20.912 --> 00:04:24.046
-The dust is back.
-I'll get a vacuum.

16
00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:26.353
Steve. I wanna show you
your room. Come on.

17
00:04:39.366 --> 00:04:41.846
A play room. cool!

18
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.153
-And you set up all my games.
-Just for you.

19
00:04:54.772 --> 00:04:57.949
I don't know why we have to keep
all these creepy paintings
and old stuff.

20
00:04:57.993 --> 00:05:00.691
Well. they came with the house.

21
00:05:00.735 --> 00:05:02.954
We'll probably get rid
of most of it.

22
00:05:02.998 --> 00:05:04.565
Here. this will cheer you up.

23
00:05:09.918 --> 00:05:12.921
-Stevie. come on.
-Coming!

24
00:05:16.359 --> 00:05:18.405
Yes! All our stuff!

25
00:05:18.448 --> 00:05:21.973
-Yay. belongings.
-I thought you'd be pleased.

26
00:05:22.017 --> 00:05:25.107
-You know nothing about me. Mom.
-Ellie.

27
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.023
You might like this room.
Follow me.

28
00:05:31.113 --> 00:05:32.462
Come on.

29
00:05:39.208 --> 00:05:40.992
You know. when I was a kid.

30
00:05:41.036 --> 00:05:42.864
I would have loved to have
lived in a place like this.

31
00:05:51.525 --> 00:05:53.178
What's in there?

32
00:05:55.311 --> 00:05:56.965
That's the cellar.

33
00:06:06.496 --> 00:06:08.324
Why don't you check it out?

34
00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:22.251
It's filthy.

35
00:06:23.252 --> 00:06:25.515
I like to think of it
as character.

36
00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:30.346
Yeah. Nothing to see here.

37
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.057
Get me out!

38
00:06:46.101 --> 00:06:48.843
There's something wrong
with the lock.

39
00:06:49.713 --> 00:06:51.846
-C'mon. it's not funny.
-Hang on. Ellie.

40
00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:53.195
Dad. c'mon!

41
00:06:59.201 --> 00:07:02.944
-Mom? Mom. Dad. get me out!
-OK. just wait. Calm down.

42
00:07:06.774 --> 00:07:08.384
Get me out!

43
00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:11.343
Brian. there's a key.
Over there. there's a key.

44
00:07:11.387 --> 00:07:13.650
-C'mon! Mom!
-We've got the key.

45
00:07:13.694 --> 00:07:16.044
-Just a minute.
-Get me out!

46
00:07:20.701 --> 00:07:22.833
-Hang on.
-Please. c'mon!

47
00:07:22.877 --> 00:07:24.444
Mom!

48
00:07:27.795 --> 00:07:29.449
Get me out!

49
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.800
Get me out!

50
00:07:36.325 --> 00:07:38.240
-I'm done here.
-Ellie.

51
00:07:38.283 --> 00:07:40.590
-I'm not staying in this house!
-That's weird.

52
00:08:04.745 --> 00:08:07.269
You OK?
Can I come in?

53
00:08:16.278 --> 00:08:17.453
Hm...

54
00:08:19.455 --> 00:08:22.023
Listen. I wanted to ask
your opinion about something.

55
00:08:25.287 --> 00:08:27.681
What does this
make you think of?

56
00:08:31.032 --> 00:08:33.469
Absolutely nothing.

57
00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:35.297
But do they look like
they're having fun?

58
00:08:37.473 --> 00:08:40.128
They look like
brainwashed sheep.

59
00:08:40.171 --> 00:08:42.913
C'mon. Mom. don't you have focus
groups for this sort of thing?

60
00:08:42.957 --> 00:08:45.307
Well. I wanted
your perspective.

61
00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.137
-I hate your job. Mom.
-OK.

62
00:08:50.965 --> 00:08:53.315
Listen. I need you to watch
Steven tonight.

63
00:08:53.358 --> 00:08:56.144
We have to go into the office.
but we won't be late. I promise.

64
00:08:56.187 --> 00:08:59.147
So. you're leaving us here
on our first night?

65
00:08:59.974 --> 00:09:02.019
Come on. Ellie.
This one's a big deal.

66
00:09:03.325 --> 00:09:05.370
This one's important. OK?

67
00:09:06.328 --> 00:09:07.677
Fine.

68
00:09:08.852 --> 00:09:10.158
Thanks.

69
00:09:15.816 --> 00:09:17.644
Why did we have to move here.
Mom?

70
00:09:19.689 --> 00:09:22.126
I'm doing this for you guys.

71
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:24.302
-So that you have a better life.
-No. you're not.

72
00:09:24.346 --> 00:09:26.566
You're doing it for yourself.

73
00:09:51.199 --> 00:09:53.636
-Where are your parents?
-They're in work.

74
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.421
You're kidding?
You've just moved in.

75
00:09:56.465 --> 00:10:00.164
Yeah. they've an important pitch
tomorrow.

76
00:10:00.208 --> 00:10:02.558
She says they need it
to survive.

77
00:10:03.428 --> 00:10:06.388
I hope they go bust
and we have to sell the house.

78
00:10:06.431 --> 00:10:08.390
Come on. Ellie.
Maybe it won't be that bad.

79
00:10:09.739 --> 00:10:12.002
I don't know.

80
00:10:12.046 --> 00:10:16.528
I just miss everyone.
I miss you.

81
00:10:16.572 --> 00:10:18.922
Why don't you come and hang out?

82
00:10:18.966 --> 00:10:22.099
-I could come stay with you.

83
00:10:22.143 --> 00:10:24.841
-Yeah. why don't you?
-Just a minute.

84
00:10:24.885 --> 00:10:27.757
- You OK?
-It's nothing.

85
00:10:29.411 --> 00:10:30.281
Ellie?

86
00:10:32.283 --> 00:10:34.895
-Is everything OK? Ellie?
-I'm gonna kill you.

87
00:10:34.938 --> 00:10:36.592
Ellie!

88
00:10:37.724 --> 00:10:41.336
This is Sophie.
19-year-old vlogger. influencer.

89
00:10:42.119 --> 00:10:44.556
She's living
a jet-set lifestyle.

90
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.384
Except she's not.

91
00:10:46.428 --> 00:10:48.952
She's an actress and we plan
to present her as a real vlogger

92
00:10:48.996 --> 00:10:50.737
with a real-life narrative.

93
00:10:51.607 --> 00:10:53.696
Now. these are some of the
initial ads which we will run

94
00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:56.438
on all social media platforms
to support the video content.

95
00:10:58.266 --> 00:11:01.312
You changed the colour
of her bracelet?

96
00:11:01.356 --> 00:11:03.271
Oh. we thought it was too...

97
00:11:03.314 --> 00:11:05.665
-Change it back.

98
00:11:07.101 --> 00:11:09.320
-I can take it.
-I got it.

99
00:11:13.281 --> 00:11:14.717
Ellie. what's up?

100
00:11:14.761 --> 00:11:16.719
-Mom. Steven keeps messing.

101
00:11:16.763 --> 00:11:19.243
He won't stay in bed.

102
00:11:19.287 --> 00:11:21.768
-We're going in!
-Put him on the phone.

103
00:11:23.378 --> 00:11:25.641
-Hello?
-Steven. come on. behave.

104
00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:27.643
-Or you'll be sorry for a week.
-OK.

105
00:11:31.386 --> 00:11:34.824
So. the target audience is
pretty self-explanatory.

106
00:11:34.868 --> 00:11:36.957
-16 to 19-year-olds.
-What did I miss?

107
00:11:43.746 --> 00:11:45.574
Where did you get this?

108
00:11:47.141 --> 00:11:49.012
I found them in there.

109
00:11:49.056 --> 00:11:50.710
What the...?

110
00:11:54.975 --> 00:11:56.585
I've had it with this house.

111
00:11:57.673 --> 00:12:00.981
Morgan from my class told me
the house was owned by a witch

112
00:12:01.024 --> 00:12:03.157
who made a pact with the devil.

113
00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.159
What? It's true!

114
00:12:08.249 --> 00:12:09.729
What's that?

115
00:12:30.227 --> 00:12:32.839
Delta...
Point vector... Sum...

116
00:12:33.796 --> 00:12:35.667
Epsilon...

117
00:12:35.711 --> 00:12:41.195
Partial One equals...
One N... DY by DX...

118
00:12:41.238 --> 00:12:43.371
One...

119
00:12:44.415 --> 00:12:46.548
Two...

120
00:12:46.591 --> 00:12:48.768
Three...

121
00:12:48.811 --> 00:12:50.726
Four...

122
00:12:51.379 --> 00:12:53.424
-Five...

123
00:12:53.468 --> 00:12:55.035
Six...

124
00:12:55.557 --> 00:12:57.689
-That's enough.

125
00:12:57.733 --> 00:13:01.215
-OK. bed.
-Ugh!

126
00:13:13.401 --> 00:13:14.968
Naomi?

127
00:13:22.105 --> 00:13:23.672
Naomi?

128
00:13:31.419 --> 00:13:33.073
Hello?

129
00:14:10.806 --> 00:14:12.460
Naomi?

130
00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:51.629
This demographic. teenage girls.
they respond well

131
00:14:51.673 --> 00:14:53.805
to aspirational marketing
and social competition.

132
00:14:53.849 --> 00:14:55.938
so can we create
a weekly vlogging chart

133
00:14:55.982 --> 00:14:58.201
where vloggers compete
to receive the most likes?

134
00:14:58.245 --> 00:15:00.203
Who's the prettiest?
Who gets the guy?

135
00:15:00.247 --> 00:15:03.032
-Natural selection.
-Law of the jungle.

136
00:15:03.076 --> 00:15:06.557
No. we call the competition
Natural Selection.

137
00:15:07.254 --> 00:15:09.560
-Nice.

138
00:15:09.604 --> 00:15:11.954
Ellie!

139
00:15:11.998 --> 00:15:14.522
Mom. all the lights
have gone out.

140
00:15:16.263 --> 00:15:17.742
Are the wall sockets out. too?

141
00:15:19.527 --> 00:15:21.529
-Yeah. I think so.
-All right.

142
00:15:21.572 --> 00:15:24.227
We have to see if the power's
cut or if we've blown a fuse.

143
00:15:24.271 --> 00:15:26.838
so I need you to go down
and check the circuit breaker.

144
00:15:26.882 --> 00:15:28.840
see if any of the trip switches
are down.

145
00:15:28.884 --> 00:15:30.842
I'm not going down
to that cellar.

146
00:15:30.886 --> 00:15:33.149
I'm not kidding you.
I'm leaving now.

147
00:15:33.193 --> 00:15:36.587
Ellie. can you just do this one
thing for Steven. if not for me?

148
00:15:36.631 --> 00:15:39.025
What if he wakes up in the dark
and no one's there?

149
00:15:41.462 --> 00:15:43.333
Fine.

150
00:15:43.377 --> 00:15:45.292
Listen. I'll stay on the line
with you.

151
00:15:57.391 --> 00:16:02.048
-Mom? Mom. are you still there?
-I'm here. I'm on the line.

152
00:16:30.032 --> 00:16:31.816
Are you OK?

153
00:16:34.819 --> 00:16:39.650
I can't see anything. I don't
know if I can do this. Mom.

154
00:16:39.694 --> 00:16:41.957
I know you can do this.

155
00:16:44.133 --> 00:16:47.615
Mom. I'm scared.
I'm sorry. I can't.

156
00:16:47.658 --> 00:16:51.575
You know what I do when
I'm scared. to clear my mind?

157
00:16:51.619 --> 00:16:53.273
-I count.
-Ah. no. not that. Mom.

158
00:16:53.316 --> 00:16:55.579
No. listen. there's ten steps
to the bottom.

159
00:16:55.623 --> 00:16:57.320
You counted them?

160
00:16:57.364 --> 00:17:00.802
Would you just... Could you just
trust me for once?

161
00:17:03.631 --> 00:17:05.981
-I'll try.
-Good.

162
00:17:06.025 --> 00:17:08.592
Now. I want you to count each
step. can you do that?

163
00:17:08.636 --> 00:17:11.465
-Yes.
-OK. just listen to my voice

164
00:17:11.508 --> 00:17:13.249
and nothing else.
just focus on the counting.

165
00:17:13.293 --> 00:17:14.816
Concentrate on that.

166
00:17:28.699 --> 00:17:30.353
One.

167
00:17:30.397 --> 00:17:33.443
-Good. Next step.

168
00:17:33.487 --> 00:17:36.055
-Two.
-OK. keep going.

169
00:17:39.841 --> 00:17:41.625
-Three.

170
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:43.105
You're doing well.

171
00:17:43.149 --> 00:17:44.889
That's great. OK? Four.

172
00:17:53.898 --> 00:17:55.509
Four.

173
00:17:59.687 --> 00:18:01.036
Four.

174
00:18:07.434 --> 00:18:10.698
It's OK. it's fine.
Keep breathing.

175
00:18:10.741 --> 00:18:12.265
Concentrate.

176
00:18:14.136 --> 00:18:17.096
-Five.
-You're halfway there.

177
00:18:23.754 --> 00:18:25.887
Six.

178
00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:31.066
Just four more.

179
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:34.025
OK? Don't quit now.
You're doing great. Ellie.

180
00:18:34.069 --> 00:18:35.723
Just keep counting.

181
00:18:36.724 --> 00:18:38.073
Seven.

182
00:18:41.903 --> 00:18:43.687
Eight.

183
00:18:43.731 --> 00:18:45.211
Good.

184
00:18:50.433 --> 00:18:52.087
Nine.

185
00:18:55.395 --> 00:18:56.961
One more.

186
00:19:07.581 --> 00:19:09.278
Ten.

187
00:19:10.236 --> 00:19:12.803
You're at the bottom. Can you
see the pillar in front of you?

188
00:19:12.847 --> 00:19:15.197
Eleven.

189
00:19:15.241 --> 00:19:16.590
Twelve.

190
00:19:17.765 --> 00:19:19.245
Thirteen.

191
00:19:20.115 --> 00:19:21.421
Fourteen.

192
00:19:22.596 --> 00:19:24.119
Fifteen.

193
00:19:24.989 --> 00:19:26.991
Sixteen.

194
00:19:27.035 --> 00:19:28.515
Seventeen.

195
00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:30.952
Eighteen.

196
00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.172
Nineteen.

197
00:19:34.216 --> 00:19:35.609
Twenty.

198
00:19:36.436 --> 00:19:38.002
Twenty-one.

199
00:19:38.829 --> 00:19:40.179
Twenty-two.

200
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.833
Twenty-three.

201
00:19:43.965 --> 00:19:45.314
Twenty-four.

202
00:19:46.446 --> 00:19:49.536
Twenty-five. Twenty-six.

203
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:52.452
Twenty-seven.

204
00:19:53.322 --> 00:19:54.671
Twenty-eight.

205
00:19:55.977 --> 00:19:58.327
Twenty-nine. Thirty.

206
00:20:01.504 --> 00:20:03.289
Ellie?

207
00:20:03.332 --> 00:20:06.292
-Ellie?
-Ellie!

208
00:20:21.263 --> 00:20:23.091
She's not here.

209
00:20:27.269 --> 00:20:29.010
What's going on?

210
00:20:34.711 --> 00:20:37.236
-Ellie!

211
00:20:39.325 --> 00:20:40.674
Ellie!

212
00:20:44.547 --> 00:20:45.853
Ellie!

213
00:20:53.556 --> 00:20:55.210
Ellie!

214
00:20:56.429 --> 00:20:59.519
-I think she's run away again.
-Right. She's done this before.

215
00:20:59.562 --> 00:21:02.522
Yeah. she'll turn up after
a few days in a friend's house.

216
00:21:59.013 --> 00:22:00.841
Why don't you go inside
and play?

217
00:22:36.964 --> 00:22:39.619
Hey. hey. hey. hey.

218
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:52.458
She was right.

219
00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:56.375
About what?

220
00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.815
When she said I didn't know
who she was any more.

221
00:23:05.819 --> 00:23:08.387
She's grown up
and we haven't even noticed.

222
00:23:09.344 --> 00:23:12.478
No. she's still
a little girl to me.

223
00:23:13.696 --> 00:23:15.655
There's no way she ran away.

224
00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:20.573
She was angry. you know.
she's upset with us.

225
00:23:24.533 --> 00:23:26.535
You didn't hear her voice.

226
00:23:28.755 --> 00:23:30.757
Counting.

227
00:24:51.359 --> 00:24:53.274
Hello?

228
00:24:53.317 --> 00:24:56.756
Oh. I'm so sorry. I totally
forgot. I'll be right there.

229
00:25:17.603 --> 00:25:19.082
I'm sorry. Steven.

230
00:25:19.126 --> 00:25:21.520
I completely forgot.

231
00:25:23.217 --> 00:25:25.349
Did Ellie come back?

232
00:25:26.307 --> 00:25:27.743
No.

233
00:25:27.787 --> 00:25:29.353
Not yet.

234
00:25:50.331 --> 00:25:52.463
We've talked
to her friends.

235
00:25:52.507 --> 00:25:54.770
We've pulled CCTV from
every bus and train station.

236
00:25:54.814 --> 00:25:56.337
but no leads. unfortunately.

237
00:25:59.645 --> 00:26:01.821
We've checked
her social media history

238
00:26:01.864 --> 00:26:04.171
and there's a lot of harassment.

239
00:26:05.825 --> 00:26:08.175
Quite nasty bullying.

240
00:26:08.218 --> 00:26:10.090
Did she mention this to you?

241
00:26:13.572 --> 00:26:15.530
No.

242
00:26:15.574 --> 00:26:18.533
Well. don't worry.
she gave as good as she got.

243
00:26:21.405 --> 00:26:23.364
She didn't run away.

244
00:26:24.539 --> 00:26:26.497
Why do you say that?

245
00:26:26.541 --> 00:26:28.674
Something happened
in the cellar.

246
00:26:28.717 --> 00:26:30.850
I heard her voice. it was...

247
00:26:32.112 --> 00:26:33.940
She didn't sound right.

248
00:26:36.029 --> 00:26:38.248
Have you tracked her cell phone?

249
00:26:38.292 --> 00:26:43.689
Er... Her phone pinged off
the Three Rock mast at 8.42pm.

250
00:26:43.732 --> 00:26:47.562
That was me. I...
I talked to her.

251
00:26:48.084 --> 00:26:52.611
Can't you just please
check the house again?

252
00:26:52.654 --> 00:26:56.353
Where I last talked to her in
the cellar. for clues. anything.

253
00:26:56.397 --> 00:26:58.878
I can come up and take a look
again. if you want.

254
00:26:58.921 --> 00:27:01.402
What about specialists?
Forensics?

255
00:27:01.445 --> 00:27:03.404
It's not a criminal case.

256
00:27:03.447 --> 00:27:04.710
I'm really sorry.

257
00:28:26.835 --> 00:28:29.098
Steven? Come here.

258
00:28:40.196 --> 00:28:43.852
How was Ellie the night...
the last night?

259
00:28:43.896 --> 00:28:45.680
The same as always.

260
00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:50.206
Is there anything
that you forgot to tell us

261
00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:51.817
or anything strange?

262
00:28:52.774 --> 00:28:54.341
We played that.

263
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.566
Go on.

264
00:32:17.544 --> 00:32:19.938
It's paint. plant-based

265
00:32:19.981 --> 00:32:22.941
so the chlorophyll shows up
as red under the UV light.

266
00:32:22.984 --> 00:32:25.813
It's very old. It's been there
since the '50s. maybe.

267
00:32:26.988 --> 00:32:29.686
Do you know anything
about the house's history?

268
00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:32.602
No. no.
We bought it at an auction.

269
00:32:32.646 --> 00:32:35.518
House and contents -
got it for nothing.

270
00:32:35.562 --> 00:32:38.913
Couldn't really turn down
that opportunity for the kids.

271
00:32:39.827 --> 00:32:43.178
I think. um... Might have been
an elderly lady?

272
00:32:43.222 --> 00:32:46.312
Who needed to make a quick sale
for nursing home costs?

273
00:32:47.095 --> 00:32:49.358
Well. the team haven't found
anything else

274
00:32:49.402 --> 00:32:51.404
that would give us
cause for concern.

275
00:32:52.927 --> 00:32:55.190
I'm afraid that's all we can do
for tonight.

276
00:32:55.234 --> 00:32:56.975
I'll follow up with you
in the morning.

277
00:32:59.151 --> 00:33:02.110
I promise you
we're doing everything we can.

278
00:33:02.154 --> 00:33:04.330
Thanks. I'll show you out.

279
00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:52.595
Mom.

280
00:33:52.639 --> 00:33:55.120
God! Steven!

281
00:33:56.643 --> 00:33:59.472
-What's the matter?
-I wet the bed.

282
00:34:01.169 --> 00:34:04.303
It's OK. Come on.
Let's get you changed.

283
00:34:06.131 --> 00:34:07.567
OK.

284
00:34:09.177 --> 00:34:10.831
What happened to Ellie?

285
00:34:14.226 --> 00:34:16.445
I don't know. Steven.

286
00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:20.058
But whatever did happen to her.
I promise you

287
00:34:20.101 --> 00:34:22.973
that we will do everything in
our power to get her back. OK?

288
00:34:23.017 --> 00:34:24.671
-OK.
-OK.

289
00:34:28.501 --> 00:34:29.893
Get some sleep.

290
00:34:36.378 --> 00:34:38.989
Hey. this is Ellie.

291
00:34:39.033 --> 00:34:42.689
I can't answer the phone
right now. I guess I'm away.

292
00:34:42.732 --> 00:34:44.995
but I'll try and get back to you
as soon as I can.

293
00:34:45.039 --> 00:34:47.346
-Probably when I'm home.

294
00:35:12.893 --> 00:35:15.330
Two.

295
00:35:15.374 --> 00:35:17.027
Three.

296
00:35:17.071 --> 00:35:18.725
Four.

297
00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:21.771
Five.

298
00:35:21.815 --> 00:35:23.251
Six.

299
00:35:24.209 --> 00:35:25.732
Seven.

300
00:35:26.559 --> 00:35:27.908
Eight.

301
00:35:28.778 --> 00:35:30.215
Nine.

302
00:35:30.954 --> 00:35:32.739
Ten.

303
00:35:32.782 --> 00:35:34.393
Eleven.

304
00:35:35.133 --> 00:35:36.395
Twelve.

305
00:35:37.483 --> 00:35:39.137
Thirteen.

306
00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:40.747
Fourteen.

307
00:35:42.009 --> 00:35:43.663
Fifteen.

308
00:35:44.446 --> 00:35:46.883
Sixteen.

309
00:35:46.927 --> 00:35:48.276
Seventeen.

310
00:35:49.495 --> 00:35:50.931
Eighteen.

311
00:35:51.975 --> 00:35:53.151
Nineteen.

312
00:35:54.239 --> 00:35:56.545
Twenty.

313
00:35:56.589 --> 00:35:58.982
Twenty-one.

314
00:35:59.026 --> 00:36:01.202
Twenty-two.

315
00:36:01.246 --> 00:36:03.596
Twenty-three.

316
00:36:03.639 --> 00:36:06.207
Twenty-four.

317
00:36:06.251 --> 00:36:08.775
Twenty-five.

318
00:36:08.818 --> 00:36:11.560
Twenty-six.

319
00:36:11.604 --> 00:36:14.084
Twenty-seven.

320
00:36:14.128 --> 00:36:16.478
Twenty-eight.

321
00:36:16.522 --> 00:36:18.785
Twenty-nine.

322
00:36:18.828 --> 00:36:21.396
Thirty.

323
00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.659
Thirty-one.

324
00:36:23.703 --> 00:36:26.096
Thirty-two.

325
00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:28.751
Thirty-three.

326
00:36:28.795 --> 00:36:31.754
-Thirty-four...

327
00:36:31.798 --> 00:36:33.756
Thirty-five.

328
00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:35.236
Thirty-six.

329
00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.369
-Thirty-seven.

330
00:36:38.718 --> 00:36:40.676
Thirty-eight.

331
00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.069
Thirty-nine.

332
00:36:43.288 --> 00:36:45.638
Forty.

333
00:38:33.093 --> 00:38:35.922
-You been up all night?
-I couldn't sleep.

334
00:38:37.184 --> 00:38:40.361
What is that? What does it mean?

335
00:38:40.405 --> 00:38:42.320
Have you thought about it?

336
00:38:42.363 --> 00:38:44.757
There's these symbols
above all the doors.

337
00:38:45.932 --> 00:38:48.238
And they're different.
but they're similar. right?

338
00:38:48.282 --> 00:38:51.590
And this... This is on the floor
in the cellar.

339
00:38:51.633 --> 00:38:54.767
It's some kind
of mathematical equation.

340
00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:57.944
We're going to get her back. K.
We are.

341
00:39:01.034 --> 00:39:02.992
She was being bullied.

342
00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:06.692
On her social media.

343
00:39:09.129 --> 00:39:10.826
We didn't even notice.

344
00:39:13.176 --> 00:39:16.136
It's because of me
they think she's a fraud.

345
00:39:16.179 --> 00:39:18.312
They don't agree
with what she stands for

346
00:39:18.356 --> 00:39:20.488
just cos she's different.
doesn't want to follow the pack.

347
00:39:20.532 --> 00:39:23.404
-I swear. those bitches...
-I know. I know. hey.

348
00:39:23.448 --> 00:39:25.406
All we can do is we support her.
OK?

349
00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:27.800
But it makes sense.
why she ran away.

350
00:39:28.453 --> 00:39:31.934
It does. I just wish
she could have talked to us.

351
00:39:31.978 --> 00:39:35.111
I feel so useless. I want to do
something but I don't know what.

352
00:39:35.155 --> 00:39:37.200
She's definitely coming back.

353
00:39:41.901 --> 00:39:43.555
I'm going to have
to go in today.

354
00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:46.688
Yeah. they loved the pitch.

355
00:39:46.732 --> 00:39:48.995
The last thing we need
is the business going under

356
00:39:49.038 --> 00:39:50.518
and us losing everything.

357
00:39:56.002 --> 00:39:57.438
Rob Clayton.

358
00:39:57.482 --> 00:39:59.875
Rob. it's Keira Woods
from the auction.

359
00:39:59.919 --> 00:40:02.225
You'll have to be
a bit more specific. I'm afraid.

360
00:40:02.269 --> 00:40:06.229
-We bought the XAÁOS property.
-Yes. What can I do for you?

361
00:40:06.273 --> 00:40:08.014
We're having some problems
with the house.

362
00:40:08.057 --> 00:40:09.450
I wondered if you had
any information

363
00:40:09.494 --> 00:40:11.452
on the previous owner.

364
00:40:11.496 --> 00:40:14.455
Not much. She's the daughter
of a well-known academic

365
00:40:14.499 --> 00:40:16.457
who owned the house originally.

366
00:40:16.501 --> 00:40:19.895
Do you have a name or a contact?

367
00:40:20.505 --> 00:40:22.681
We only dealt
with her solicitor. I'm afraid.

368
00:40:22.724 --> 00:40:25.814
-But leave it with me.
-OK. thank you.

369
00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:02.590
Erica. I need a favour.

370
00:41:05.071 --> 00:41:07.726
-Shoot.
-I sent you an email.

371
00:41:07.769 --> 00:41:09.467
Oh.

372
00:41:10.293 --> 00:41:13.688
Can you find out what font
or language these are?

373
00:41:13.732 --> 00:41:16.691
-And what they mean?
-Yeah. they look familiar.

374
00:41:16.735 --> 00:41:18.650
-Leave it with me.
-Great.

375
00:41:20.478 --> 00:41:22.218
We're talking about
target demographics.

376
00:41:22.262 --> 00:41:25.134
16 to 19-year-olds with a focus
on leaving cert students...

377
00:41:25.178 --> 00:41:26.919
Congratulations.

378
00:41:28.921 --> 00:41:32.228
We just loved
your Natural Selection campaign.

379
00:41:32.272 --> 00:41:33.708
Thank you.

380
00:41:33.752 --> 00:41:36.102
We had a similar campaign
go viral last year

381
00:41:36.145 --> 00:41:38.278
with the hashtag
"follow your heart".

382
00:41:38.321 --> 00:41:40.498
A wonderful campaign.

383
00:41:40.541 --> 00:41:43.283
We really like the simplicity
of the competition.

384
00:41:43.326 --> 00:41:45.459
Simplicity is key.

385
00:41:45.503 --> 00:41:48.593
I can't remember who said it.
and I am paraphrasing. but...

386
00:41:49.376 --> 00:41:53.293
..the receptivity of the great
masses is very limited...

387
00:41:55.513 --> 00:41:57.950
Their intelligence is small

388
00:41:57.993 --> 00:42:00.822
but their power of forgetting
is enormous.

389
00:42:00.866 --> 00:42:01.823
Nice.

390
00:42:04.304 --> 00:42:05.479
Excuse me.

391
00:42:12.007 --> 00:42:14.096
Hey. Keira.

392
00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:16.664
It's Hebrew.
Hebrew glyphs. to be exact.

393
00:42:16.708 --> 00:42:18.797
So. they don't mean anything
individually

394
00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:21.147
but when I put them
in a certain order.

395
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:23.628
they spell "leviathan"?

396
00:42:24.324 --> 00:42:26.631
Some sort of sea creature
in Jewish mythology.

397
00:42:28.633 --> 00:42:30.417
Thanks.

398
00:42:54.354 --> 00:42:57.444
-Where's Dad?
-He had to work late.

399
00:42:59.359 --> 00:43:02.797
What happened to your face?
Let me see.

400
00:43:02.841 --> 00:43:06.061
Morgan said Ellie was dead.
so I hit him and he hit me back.

401
00:44:37.936 --> 00:44:40.808
Delta... Point vector...

402
00:44:40.852 --> 00:44:43.028
Sum... Epsilon...

403
00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:46.945
Partial One equals...
One N...

404
00:44:46.988 --> 00:44:48.947
DY by DX...

405
00:44:50.644 --> 00:44:51.776
One.

406
00:44:53.865 --> 00:44:55.388
Two.

407
00:44:56.955 --> 00:44:58.783
Three.

408
00:45:00.393 --> 00:45:02.482
Four.

409
00:45:03.309 --> 00:45:04.702
Five.

410
00:45:05.485 --> 00:45:07.705
Six.

411
00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:10.142
Seven.

412
00:45:11.317 --> 00:45:13.885
Eight.

413
00:45:16.757 --> 00:45:18.324
Nine.

414
00:45:20.152 --> 00:45:21.457
Ten.

415
00:45:21.501 --> 00:45:23.372
Steven!

416
00:45:24.199 --> 00:45:27.028
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

417
00:45:27.072 --> 00:45:29.074
Why are you doing that?
Counting?

418
00:45:30.162 --> 00:45:31.511
Was I?

419
00:45:33.556 --> 00:45:34.906
I thought you were playing
your game.

420
00:45:35.689 --> 00:45:37.299
Y-yeah.

421
00:45:37.343 --> 00:45:38.605
OK.

422
00:47:42.642 --> 00:47:44.296
Mom!

423
00:47:44.339 --> 00:47:45.863
Steven.

424
00:47:48.169 --> 00:47:49.649
Steven?

425
00:47:52.391 --> 00:47:54.610
-Steven?
-Mom. help!

426
00:47:54.654 --> 00:47:58.571
Steven.
What are you doing in there?

427
00:47:59.354 --> 00:48:03.358
-Help. I'm stuck!
-Just a second. I'm right here.

428
00:48:05.839 --> 00:48:08.015
Hang on a second.

429
00:48:08.059 --> 00:48:10.888
Wait. Steven?

430
00:48:10.931 --> 00:48:13.455
-Do you have the key?
-No.

431
00:48:13.499 --> 00:48:16.110
-The lock is jammed.
-It's dark. Mom. I'm scared.

432
00:48:16.154 --> 00:48:17.720
Hang on. I'm right here.
just outside.

433
00:48:18.547 --> 00:48:19.897
Hang on.

434
00:48:28.166 --> 00:48:29.732
Steven.

435
00:48:30.995 --> 00:48:32.997
Steven!

436
00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:35.521
Who are you talking to?

437
00:48:35.564 --> 00:48:38.350
-Where were you?
-I fell asleep in the playroom.

438
00:48:38.393 --> 00:48:41.483
-It's all right. OK.
-What's happening?

439
00:48:41.527 --> 00:48:44.182
-I thought I heard something.

440
00:48:44.225 --> 00:48:45.531
Shush.

441
00:48:46.271 --> 00:48:49.535
-Don't move.

442
00:49:27.399 --> 00:49:30.271
-Mom.

443
00:49:32.317 --> 00:49:33.927
Stay there.

444
00:49:44.285 --> 00:49:45.765
Mom!

445
00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:48.898
Steven!

446
00:49:48.942 --> 00:49:50.770
-Steven!
-It's stuck.

447
00:49:50.813 --> 00:49:52.119
I can't get it open.

448
00:50:21.496 --> 00:50:23.020
Steven!

449
00:50:24.804 --> 00:50:27.502
Steven. try pulling on the door.

450
00:50:27.546 --> 00:50:28.677
I am!

451
00:50:31.289 --> 00:50:33.117
The key!
What about the key?

452
00:50:38.339 --> 00:50:40.254
I can't reach it.
I need to get a chair.

453
00:50:40.298 --> 00:50:41.734
Hurry up!

454
00:50:46.304 --> 00:50:47.914
Hurry up!

455
00:50:50.090 --> 00:50:53.006
-That's it.

456
00:50:54.747 --> 00:50:57.489
Steven! Hurry!

457
00:51:01.145 --> 00:51:03.930
-I still can't get it to work.

458
00:51:18.945 --> 00:51:23.341
-One. two. three...

459
00:51:26.866 --> 00:51:28.824
-Steve. what's up?
-Dad!

460
00:51:28.868 --> 00:51:30.870
Mom's stuck
and I can't get her out.

461
00:51:33.046 --> 00:51:34.178
Brian.

462
00:51:57.157 --> 00:51:59.942
He's asleep. finally.

463
00:52:00.813 --> 00:52:03.598
What happened. K?

464
00:52:03.642 --> 00:52:05.905
The lights went out
and I got stuck in the cellar.

465
00:52:07.559 --> 00:52:09.430
There was something in there.

466
00:52:11.476 --> 00:52:13.652
-Something?
-Yeah. I heard something.

467
00:52:15.567 --> 00:52:18.570
It was in there with me.
A presence.

468
00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:23.314
Take a look. I dropped my phone.
It fell down the steps.

469
00:52:24.141 --> 00:52:26.186
It's not there any more.
It disappeared.

470
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:28.232
I'm sure your phone
is still there.

471
00:52:28.275 --> 00:52:30.364
I also found out about the
family that used to live here.

472
00:52:30.408 --> 00:52:32.323
The Fetherstons.

473
00:52:33.759 --> 00:52:36.283
They all went missing. all
of them except their daughter.

474
00:52:37.415 --> 00:52:40.592
Missing. Brian. Just like Ellie.

475
00:52:40.635 --> 00:52:43.116
-What are you trying to tell me?
-I don't know!

476
00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:45.074
I just know that our daughter is
missing and something very wrong

477
00:52:45.118 --> 00:52:47.251
is happening in the place
that she disappeared.

478
00:52:50.471 --> 00:52:52.560
I'm going to go look
for your phone.

479
00:52:52.604 --> 00:52:55.259
-OK?

480
00:54:02.326 --> 00:54:04.806
Come in.

481
00:54:09.855 --> 00:54:11.813
I'm sorry.
I'm looking for Dr Fournet.

482
00:54:11.857 --> 00:54:14.294
-Who are you?
-Keira Woods.

483
00:54:14.338 --> 00:54:17.819
-I made an appointment with...
-What can I do for you?

484
00:54:17.863 --> 00:54:19.430
Um...

485
00:54:30.267 --> 00:54:32.312
Where did you get this?

486
00:54:32.356 --> 00:54:34.401
I bought John Fetherston's
family home.

487
00:54:35.446 --> 00:54:37.883
It was engraved on the floor
in the cellar.

488
00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:47.240
"Delta point vector sum epsilon
partial I equals 1N DY by DX."

489
00:54:51.810 --> 00:54:56.728
Call me Remi. please. I haven't
got used to this doctor thing.

490
00:54:56.771 --> 00:55:01.036
You see. I was in a car crash
and a bang to the head

491
00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:03.909
changed the parts of my brain
we don't usually use

492
00:55:03.952 --> 00:55:07.173
and...
well. now I'm a bloody genius!

493
00:55:10.307 --> 00:55:12.439
How does that work?

494
00:55:12.483 --> 00:55:15.224
Before the accident I could
barely add double numbers.

495
00:55:15.268 --> 00:55:17.575
But afterwards.

496
00:55:17.618 --> 00:55:20.752
I began to understand
the language of mathematics.

497
00:55:20.795 --> 00:55:22.536
I began to see patterns
in everything

498
00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:25.147
and somehow make sense
of the universe.

499
00:55:25.191 --> 00:55:27.585
That's my magic trick.

500
00:55:27.628 --> 00:55:30.065
I'm able to visualise
mathematical structures.

501
00:55:30.109 --> 00:55:33.286
That's pi.
that's Hawking radiation

502
00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:35.201
and that's a quantum star.

503
00:55:39.771 --> 00:55:42.774
Who was he. Fetherston?

504
00:55:42.817 --> 00:55:45.733
Well... You're standing
in his old office.

505
00:55:45.777 --> 00:55:48.736
He was a colleague
of Erwin Schroödinger.

506
00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:51.870
-Nobel Prize winner
-Cat in a box.

507
00:55:52.827 --> 00:55:55.700
-Yes. the cat.
-Yeah. I never understood it.

508
00:55:57.310 --> 00:55:59.094
It's simply his way
of illustrating

509
00:55:59.138 --> 00:56:02.315
the misrepresentation
of having quantum particles

510
00:56:02.359 --> 00:56:04.317
existing in two states.

511
00:56:06.972 --> 00:56:10.454
The cat in the box
is either dead or alive.

512
00:56:10.497 --> 00:56:13.935
We can't tell until we open
the box to observe it.

513
00:56:13.979 --> 00:56:16.982
So. until we do so.
the cat is both dead and alive.

514
00:56:21.987 --> 00:56:24.163
-I'm sorry. did I say something?
-No. no.

515
00:56:26.557 --> 00:56:29.298
My daughter is missing. so...

516
00:56:29.342 --> 00:56:30.996
I'm very sorry to hear that.

517
00:56:31.736 --> 00:56:33.868
Please continue.

518
00:56:33.912 --> 00:56:37.611
Well. Schroödinger came
to Ireland in the '40s

519
00:56:37.655 --> 00:56:41.528
to escape the Nazis and work on
his unified field theory here.

520
00:56:41.572 --> 00:56:45.445
Fetherston worked closely with
him until his son became ill

521
00:56:45.489 --> 00:56:47.795
and he disappeared
from academic circles.

522
00:56:47.839 --> 00:56:50.494
Completely disappeared?
I mean. does anyone know what
happened to him?

523
00:56:50.537 --> 00:56:52.060
No. It's a mystery.

524
00:56:52.104 --> 00:56:54.367
He has a daughter. Rose.

525
00:56:54.411 --> 00:56:56.630
who you must have purchased
the house from.

526
00:56:56.674 --> 00:56:59.328
I don't think
she ever recovered.

527
00:56:59.372 --> 00:57:01.679
Never really spoke
about what happened.

528
00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:06.988
I can't visualise this yet but
at first glance. your problem.

529
00:57:07.032 --> 00:57:10.557
your equation is definitely a
representation for a dimension.

530
00:57:10.601 --> 00:57:12.559
Or dimensions.

531
00:57:12.603 --> 00:57:14.169
There seems to be one variable

532
00:57:14.213 --> 00:57:16.520
that's interchangeable
for each dimension.

533
00:57:16.563 --> 00:57:19.131
It's incredibly complex. like
nothing I've ever seen before.

534
00:57:20.959 --> 00:57:23.396
Can you leave it with me
and I'll come back to you?

535
00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:25.311
That would be great. Thank you.

536
00:57:52.164 --> 00:57:54.775
-Hi.

537
00:58:01.086 --> 00:58:02.870
Hello. Keira Woods.

538
00:58:02.914 --> 00:58:05.699
Keira. it's Remi Fournet here.

539
00:58:05.743 --> 00:58:08.223
-Is everything OK?
-Yes. why?

540
00:58:08.267 --> 00:58:10.312
I called you a few times and...

541
00:58:10.356 --> 00:58:13.446
Oh. you know. I lost my phone. I
just managed to replace it now.

542
00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:16.144
That's strange.
Someone answered.

543
00:58:16.188 --> 00:58:19.147
-What did they say?
-It was counting.

544
00:58:19.191 --> 00:58:21.933
Eleven. Twelve. Thirteen.

545
00:58:23.021 --> 00:58:25.458
I wasn't sure if you were OK
or what was going on.

546
00:58:26.764 --> 00:58:28.374
-Keira?
-No. I'm OK.

547
00:58:29.114 --> 00:58:31.159
I wanted to let you know

548
00:58:31.203 --> 00:58:33.901
that I spoke to a colleague in
France about your equation.

549
00:58:33.945 --> 00:58:36.643
He seems to think it's related
to a branch of mathematics

550
00:58:36.687 --> 00:58:39.820
created by alchemists
in the 12th century.

551
00:58:39.864 --> 00:58:42.431
He likened it to more
of an incomplete sequence

552
00:58:42.475 --> 00:58:44.956
or an unfinished incantation.

553
00:58:46.305 --> 00:58:48.612
It's a very peculiar sequence
and it does seem to refer

554
00:58:48.655 --> 00:58:51.528
to dimensions.
but it's incomplete. as I said.

555
00:58:51.571 --> 00:58:53.442
Sorry I can't be more help.

556
00:58:53.486 --> 00:58:55.793
Well. thank you
for looking into it for me.

557
00:58:55.836 --> 00:58:58.099
There is one other piece
of information.

558
00:58:58.143 --> 00:59:00.275
My colleague has come across
a similar one

559
00:59:00.319 --> 00:59:02.451
engraved in a house in Belgium.

560
00:59:02.495 --> 00:59:04.671
An infamous house. actually.

561
00:59:04.715 --> 00:59:08.196
where a family went missing.
vanished into thin air.

562
00:59:10.329 --> 00:59:12.070
Keira?

563
00:59:12.810 --> 00:59:14.942
Keira?

564
00:59:21.645 --> 00:59:24.212
-Steve. I'm gonna talk to Mom.
-OK.

565
00:59:28.521 --> 00:59:30.741
-Hey. are you good?
-Yeah.

566
00:59:50.543 --> 00:59:52.110
I've emailed these to you.

567
00:59:53.546 --> 00:59:55.679
These are the engravings
above the door.

568
00:59:55.722 --> 00:59:58.203
They're Hebrew.
They mean "leviathan".

569
00:59:58.246 --> 01:00:01.249
Like I said. I don't know
what these triangles represent

570
01:00:01.293 --> 01:00:03.817
but the letters. this is what
they mean. look what it says.

571
01:00:03.861 --> 01:00:05.732
The abyss.

572
01:00:05.776 --> 01:00:08.169
Fetherston. the man who owned
the place. called it XAÁOS.

573
01:00:08.213 --> 01:00:10.998
Greek for chaos.
the void before time. the abyss.

574
01:00:11.042 --> 01:00:13.174
You're making huge leaps
and connections between things

575
01:00:13.218 --> 01:00:15.002
that are completely unrelated.

576
01:00:15.046 --> 01:00:18.615
I could tell you that your name
Keira in Greek means Dark Lord

577
01:00:18.658 --> 01:00:20.529
and you're connected to this.

578
01:00:20.573 --> 01:00:23.707
-That's ridiculous!
-It also means dark-haired.

579
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:25.534
You get my point?

580
01:00:25.578 --> 01:00:28.102
Look. the guy who owned this
house was an obsessed academic.

581
01:00:28.146 --> 01:00:30.191
All of this. it's decorative.

582
01:00:30.235 --> 01:00:32.759
It doesn't mean anything.

583
01:00:32.803 --> 01:00:35.544
You know better than anyone
that everything has a meaning.

584
01:00:35.588 --> 01:00:37.546
Every image. every word
is doing something.

585
01:00:37.590 --> 01:00:39.592
These are pieces in a puzzle.
can't you see that?

586
01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:42.682
So. what are you suggesting?
What do all these symbols mean?

587
01:00:42.726 --> 01:00:45.076
I don't know yet. I've got
to show you something.

588
01:00:57.436 --> 01:01:00.657
Look. You see? Each step
is numbered. one to ten.

589
01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:04.965
What about this? Look.

590
01:01:47.486 --> 01:01:49.488
I met with a physics
professor today.

591
01:01:49.531 --> 01:01:51.751
He thinks it's a formula
to a different dimension.

592
01:01:51.795 --> 01:01:54.014
-Another place. Brian.
-Keira.

593
01:01:54.058 --> 01:01:56.364
This is delusional thinking.

594
01:01:56.408 --> 01:01:59.150
The same equation was found
in another home in Belgium.

595
01:01:59.193 --> 01:02:01.761
where another family
went missing.

596
01:02:01.805 --> 01:02:04.198
This is our way to get her back.
I know it.

597
01:02:04.242 --> 01:02:06.548
Please. Brian. I need your help.

598
01:02:08.812 --> 01:02:10.422
No.

599
01:02:38.624 --> 01:02:41.888
Brian! What are you doing?

600
01:02:44.891 --> 01:02:46.458
Stop!

601
01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:03.562
One...

602
01:03:04.215 --> 01:03:06.173
Two...

603
01:03:06.217 --> 01:03:07.392
Three...

604
01:03:24.278 --> 01:03:26.628
Ellie?

605
01:03:30.284 --> 01:03:32.156
Mom! Dad!

606
01:03:33.418 --> 01:03:35.115
Steven.

607
01:03:40.773 --> 01:03:43.080
-What?
-There's something in there.

608
01:03:43.123 --> 01:03:44.908
It looks like Ellie.

609
01:03:50.609 --> 01:03:54.178
Ten... Ten... Ten... Ten...

610
01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:03.796
It's Ellie's.

611
01:04:18.637 --> 01:04:21.161
Hi. Keira. Rob Clayton here.

612
01:04:21.205 --> 01:04:24.338
I've tracked down
Rose Fetherston.

613
01:04:24.382 --> 01:04:26.863
She's in a private nursing home
called St Anthony's.

614
01:04:26.906 --> 01:04:29.343
I'll put you in touch
with her carer. Ruth Collins.

615
01:04:59.330 --> 01:05:03.769
-Hi. Thank you for meeting.
-Rose agreed to it.

616
01:05:04.857 --> 01:05:08.208
She's inside.
She finds it peaceful here.

617
01:05:09.993 --> 01:05:12.386
-She doesn't speak much.
-OK.

618
01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:13.779
Thank you.

619
01:05:36.062 --> 01:05:37.890
Hello. Rose.

620
01:05:41.894 --> 01:05:45.550
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Keira.

621
01:05:49.597 --> 01:05:51.643
My family moved into your house.

622
01:05:53.253 --> 01:05:55.255
And now my daughter is missing.

623
01:05:57.954 --> 01:06:00.782
I came here to ask you
about your father.

624
01:06:07.050 --> 01:06:08.747
And about the cellar.

625
01:06:14.622 --> 01:06:17.886
I know you've lost your family.
I know what that's like.

626
01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:20.367
I've lost my daughter. so if
there's something that you know.

627
01:06:20.411 --> 01:06:22.761
will you please. please tell me?

628
01:06:29.028 --> 01:06:30.247
Leviathan!

629
01:06:30.290 --> 01:06:31.465
Yes.

630
01:06:36.427 --> 01:06:38.429
One of the seven
princes of hell.

631
01:06:41.998 --> 01:06:43.651
What is it?

632
01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:47.351
That isn't its name.

633
01:06:48.961 --> 01:06:52.008
Whose name? Rose. tell me.

634
01:06:53.792 --> 01:06:56.273
My father brought it
into our world.

635
01:06:57.970 --> 01:06:59.580
Your father? He was a scientist.

636
01:06:59.624 --> 01:07:03.497
He was. until my brother Jack
got sick

637
01:07:03.541 --> 01:07:05.282
and science couldn't help him.

638
01:07:07.327 --> 01:07:09.112
It's OK.

639
01:07:09.155 --> 01:07:11.288
Please take your time.

640
01:07:12.332 --> 01:07:16.989
Mathematics are supposed
to make sense of the universe.

641
01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:19.513
to make order from chaos.

642
01:07:21.994 --> 01:07:24.431
But all he succeeded in doing

643
01:07:24.475 --> 01:07:26.825
was bringing darkness
into the world.

644
01:07:27.695 --> 01:07:33.310
A darkness that has existed
since before the universe began.

645
01:07:35.138 --> 01:07:37.009
Something ancient.

646
01:07:38.706 --> 01:07:43.276
Something that has been known...
by many names.

647
01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:46.105
Where is my daughter?
Is she still in the cellar?

648
01:07:46.149 --> 01:07:49.587
It's not just the cellar.
It's the whole house!

649
01:08:46.383 --> 01:08:48.515
Hello. Keira...

650
01:08:48.559 --> 01:08:50.082
One...

651
01:08:51.083 --> 01:08:53.694
Two...

652
01:08:53.738 --> 01:08:55.392
Three...

653
01:10:18.301 --> 01:10:19.954
Hey.

654
01:10:19.998 --> 01:10:21.695
Look at this.

655
01:10:24.829 --> 01:10:28.180
These are the shapes
from over the doors. OK?

656
01:10:30.008 --> 01:10:32.663
Five acute triangles.

657
01:10:32.706 --> 01:10:34.317
And a pentagon.

658
01:10:36.841 --> 01:10:38.886
OK. and there's more.

659
01:10:48.896 --> 01:10:52.726
Leviathan the sea
serpent is misdirection.

660
01:10:57.209 --> 01:11:00.256
These are the Hebrew glyphs
over the five points.

661
01:11:06.087 --> 01:11:07.567
Look.

662
01:11:13.356 --> 01:11:14.966
Baphomet.

663
01:11:16.359 --> 01:11:19.492
It's some sort of demon

664
01:11:19.536 --> 01:11:22.539
that the occultists and
the Knights Templar worshipped.

665
01:11:22.582 --> 01:11:25.063
Some sort of gatekeeper
or soldier in hell.

666
01:11:29.807 --> 01:11:33.158
-An ancient evil.
-Look. look at the fingers.

667
01:11:33.941 --> 01:11:36.727
Just like in the painting.
And there.

668
01:11:38.729 --> 01:11:41.297
Solve Coagula?

669
01:11:42.428 --> 01:11:44.822
This whole house has been
designed around it.

670
01:12:24.644 --> 01:12:26.472
Schroödinger's cat.

671
01:12:26.516 --> 01:12:29.214
That's Ellie - neither dead
nor alive until we find her.

672
01:12:37.962 --> 01:12:41.357
-Delta... Point vector...
-What's that?

673
01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:43.750
Sum... Epsilon...

674
01:12:43.794 --> 01:12:46.797
Partial One equals... 1N...

675
01:12:48.059 --> 01:12:50.540
DY by DX...

676
01:12:52.455 --> 01:12:54.152
-One...
-One.

677
01:12:55.327 --> 01:12:58.156
-Two.
-Two.

678
01:12:58.199 --> 01:13:00.680
That's the mathematical equation
on the cellar floor.

679
01:13:00.724 --> 01:13:02.682
I'm positive it's Fetherston.

680
01:13:02.726 --> 01:13:05.381
-He's reading it out loud.
-But what does that mean?

681
01:13:06.207 --> 01:13:08.732
-I think it opens the box.
- Seven...

682
01:13:10.386 --> 01:13:11.865
Eight...

683
01:13:16.043 --> 01:13:17.480
Nine...

684
01:13:21.571 --> 01:13:23.311
Ten...

685
01:13:23.355 --> 01:13:26.010
Eleven... Twelve...

686
01:14:16.408 --> 01:14:18.236
-Steven!

687
01:14:23.981 --> 01:14:25.635
Steven?

688
01:14:36.907 --> 01:14:38.343
Brian.

689
01:14:51.922 --> 01:14:54.185
Check upstairs.

690
01:15:05.457 --> 01:15:06.937
Steven?

691
01:15:28.785 --> 01:15:30.700
He's gone.

692
01:16:02.906 --> 01:16:06.562
Forty-one...
Forty-two...

693
01:16:07.345 --> 01:16:11.001
-Forty-three... Forty-four...
-Shush.

694
01:16:11.044 --> 01:16:14.004
Forty-five... Forty-six...

695
01:16:14.047 --> 01:16:15.658
Do you hear that?

696
01:16:25.015 --> 01:16:26.756
Steven!

697
01:16:30.716 --> 01:16:32.196
Carry him. quickly.

698
01:16:43.381 --> 01:16:45.818
-Take this off.

699
01:16:45.862 --> 01:16:49.082
He's so hot. Come on. Steven.
You're OK.

700
01:16:50.562 --> 01:16:53.391
-What happened?
-Nothing. You're safe now.

701
01:16:55.219 --> 01:16:57.351
-I'm thirsty.
-I'll get him some water.

702
01:16:57.395 --> 01:16:59.658
Tell me. Steven.
Did you see Ellie?

703
01:16:59.702 --> 01:17:01.573
I don't know.

704
01:17:02.313 --> 01:17:04.707
-I can't remember.
-It's OK. I'm sorry.

705
01:17:07.579 --> 01:17:09.668
You're so hot.

706
01:17:09.712 --> 01:17:11.888
Here. let me take this off.

707
01:17:16.762 --> 01:17:18.634
What is it?

708
01:17:20.287 --> 01:17:21.724
Nothing.

709
01:17:25.945 --> 01:17:29.993
-I remember.
-What do you remember?

710
01:17:30.994 --> 01:17:34.258
I rode the beast
with seven heads and ten horns.

711
01:17:39.524 --> 01:17:41.526
