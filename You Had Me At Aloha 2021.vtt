[bright upbeat music]

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.133
Hi. I'm Todd Harper.

7
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:29.266
And I hope you'll join
me as we make Hawaii

8
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.800
our Next Destination. only
on The Expedition Channel.

9
00:00:35.667 --> 00:00:38.934
Marty. I need to. oh. Paige.
what are you doing here?

10
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.734
I'm seeing if there's
anything we can salvage

11
00:00:40.867 --> 00:00:42.567
from this Hawaii promo.

12
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.300
Marty's the one that's supposed
to be sitting here alone

13
00:00:44.433 --> 00:00:47.633
in the dark. trying to see
if we can save anything.

14
00:00:47.767 --> 00:00:50.734
You're a producer.
you're allowed sunlight

15
00:00:50.867 --> 00:00:53.567
Millie. you're shooting
in Hawaii in three weeks.

16
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.433
and we don't have a host.

17
00:00:55.567 --> 00:00:57.867
No one gets sunlight until
we solve that little problem.

18
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.533
Well. the network is
not gonna give Todd.

19
00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:02.300
the salary he wants.

20
00:01:02.433 --> 00:01:05.033
or the bigger dressing. room
or the bigger. wardrobe budget.

21
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.367
Well. then we need
to replace him.

22
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.600
Well. I have submitted everyone.

23
00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:11.100
with even the slightest
on-camera experience

24
00:01:11.233 --> 00:01:12.600
on a travel show.

25
00:01:12.734 --> 00:01:14.500
And they have rejected
almost everyone.

26
00:01:14.633 --> 00:01:19.266
I think the only one
I haven't sent them. is you.

27
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.100
I don't host shows
anymore. remember?

28
00:01:21.233 --> 00:01:22.834
You miss being
in front of the camera.

29
00:01:22.967 --> 00:01:24.333
Don't tell me you don't.

30
00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:27.300
I am perfectly content
behind the scenes.

31
00:01:27.433 --> 00:01:29.633
Just not these scenes.

32
00:01:30.934 --> 00:01:32.166
[laughs]

33
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.533
Come on. Millie. stop.

34
00:01:34.667 --> 00:01:36.367
Next Destination
was your idea.

35
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.700
I wanna be executive producer
of a show that I created.

36
00:01:39.834 --> 00:01:41.834
Well. they haven't said no.

37
00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:44.834
No. not yet. but hang on!

38
00:01:44.967 --> 00:01:50.834
You said almost.
almost everyone.
rejected almost everyone.

39
00:01:50.967 --> 00:01:53.500
Is there somebody
they're considering?

40
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.700
[upbeat music]

41
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.767
Ben Burton?
You're kidding. right?

42
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.934
Well. he co-hosted the
first season with Todd.

43
00:02:09.066 --> 00:02:11.767
and the network thinks
the viewers will love it
if he comes back.

44
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.066
I mean. you remember
him. don't you?

45
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.900
No. he left before I started.

46
00:02:15.033 --> 00:02:17.900
but you told me how difficult
he was. you fired him.

47
00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:20.233
Paige. we need a host.

48
00:02:20.367 --> 00:02:22.000
If he's gonna help
us with our ratings.

49
00:02:22.133 --> 00:02:23.734
he might be worth the trouble.

50
00:02:23.867 --> 00:02:26.533
He is all about the stunt
and nothing of substance.

51
00:02:26.667 --> 00:02:30.033
Is he even gonna be happy.
if he can't jump off things?

52
00:02:30.166 --> 00:02:32.700
He doesn't only jump off things.

53
00:02:32.834 --> 00:02:34.834
Who's ready to jump off a cliff?

54
00:02:34.967 --> 00:02:36.066
[screams]

55
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.667
Hey everybody. it's Ben Burton.

56
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.400
Welcome to another
episode of Bold World.

57
00:02:40.533 --> 00:02:43.700
Today. we are live streaming
from beautiful Belize.

58
00:02:43.834 --> 00:02:46.900
because one of our viewers.
Jessies_Girl1944.

59
00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:49.400
said that this was
one of the best spots.

60
00:02:49.533 --> 00:02:52.533
on the entire planet
to go cliff diving.

61
00:02:52.667 --> 00:02:56.500
And as you can see. it is
a long ways down to that water.

62
00:02:56.633 --> 00:02:58.166
I can't get the shot from here.

63
00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.266
Of course you can't
get the shot from here.

64
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.333
you gotta come around to here.

65
00:03:01.467 --> 00:03:03.834
Oh no. I'm not going anywhere
near the edge of that cliff.

66
00:03:03.967 --> 00:03:06.834
Luis. we're live
in 10 minutes. man.

67
00:03:06.967 --> 00:03:08.633
you gotta find your spot.

68
00:03:08.767 --> 00:03:11.967
No. I found a spot. just not
anywhere near that cliff.

69
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.200
[beep]

70
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.166
Luis. the name of
the show is Bold World.

71
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.400
You gotta be bold. it's
right there in the title.

72
00:03:22.533 --> 00:03:23.900
Yeah well. my idea
of being bold.

73
00:03:24.033 --> 00:03:25.800
does not involve me
jumping off a cliff.

74
00:03:25.934 --> 00:03:29.266
because somebody named
"Jessies_Girl1944" told me to.

75
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.934
Its probably not
even her real name.

76
00:03:31.066 --> 00:03:34.100
Ben. you gotta take this
Next Destination gig.

77
00:03:34.233 --> 00:03:35.967
They haven't offered
it to me yet.

78
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.934
And the truth is. I don't
know what I'm gonna say

79
00:03:39.066 --> 00:03:40.066
even if they do.

80
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.900
You kidding me? You say yes.

81
00:03:42.033 --> 00:03:43.734
I'm doing my own thing.

82
00:03:43.867 --> 00:03:45.667
I like being able to go
anywhere. at a moment's notice.

83
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.567
and not have to follow
a script. I did that before.

84
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.433
Remember how that went?

85
00:03:50.567 --> 00:03:52.734
The one thing I learned is that
I belong off the beaten path.

86
00:03:52.867 --> 00:03:54.633
Well. that cliff
is too far off the path.

87
00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:56.800
[upbeat music]

88
00:03:56.934 --> 00:03:59.734
[Millie] Look. Ben Burton
is our only option right now.

89
00:03:59.867 --> 00:04:02.734
It's either him.
or I submit you.

90
00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:05.000
Let's get back out there.
see the world--

91
00:04:05.133 --> 00:04:08.000
No. this. this is how I like
to see the world these days.

92
00:04:08.133 --> 00:04:09.367
Why are you pushing this?

93
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.800
Because I care
about your happiness.

94
00:04:14.934 --> 00:04:17.900
and-- ughh! --
Roger in Accounting says.

95
00:04:18.033 --> 00:04:20.000
I need to be more sensitive
to people's "feelings."

96
00:04:20.133 --> 00:04:21.633
I mean. why would he say that?

97
00:04:21.767 --> 00:04:24.800
Because you put the word
"feelings" in air quotes.

98
00:04:24.934 --> 00:04:27.900
Okay. well. I'm not that
crazy about Ben Barton either.

99
00:04:28.033 --> 00:04:29.734
But. if you don't
want to audition.

100
00:04:29.867 --> 00:04:31.633
we don't have any other choice.

101
00:04:31.767 --> 00:04:33.867
Okay. Millie. do you know
why Todd Harper was so popular?

102
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Because he's British and
people take him more seriously?

103
00:04:36.133 --> 00:04:40.166
No--
Okay. yes. partly that.

104
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.800
But it's mostly

105
00:04:41.934 --> 00:04:44.033
because people felt
like they could trust him.

106
00:04:44.166 --> 00:04:46.633
They knew the things
Todd recommended.

107
00:04:46.767 --> 00:04:47.967
would give them
a great vacation.

108
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.166
that would put them
in a great mood.

109
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.133
Not put them in the hospital.

110
00:04:53.266 --> 00:04:55.734
Okay. I understand
how you "feel"--
Mm...

111
00:04:55.867 --> 00:04:58.166
But you still have to see Ben.

112
00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.967
I have to see him?

113
00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:01.400
You already set up an audition?

114
00:05:01.533 --> 00:05:03.066
Well. I've already
talked to him.

115
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.800
And everybody at
the Expedition Channel
is on board.

116
00:05:05.934 --> 00:05:07.400
they just wanna
see him on film.

117
00:05:07.533 --> 00:05:09.633
and make sure
he can behave himself.

118
00:05:09.767 --> 00:05:10.934
You can handle this. sis.

119
00:05:11.066 --> 00:05:12.467
-Hey--
-Hub-bub.

120
00:05:16.033 --> 00:05:17.934
Now remember. you can
only cliff dive.

121
00:05:18.066 --> 00:05:20.700
from certified jump locations.

122
00:05:20.834 --> 00:05:25.367
Please. get some training
before you do it.

123
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.467
[exhales] Okay.

124
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.300
-[surf rolling]
-[laughs]

125
00:05:34.433 --> 00:05:36.400
Wha-ha-ha-hoo!

126
00:05:36.533 --> 00:05:40.633
Here we go! Okay!
[exhales]

127
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.734
[tense music]

128
00:05:46.934 --> 00:05:48.567
How's Hawaii?

129
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:49.900
[Millie] Amazing. I'm
on the beach right now.

130
00:05:50.033 --> 00:05:51.433
You should be here.

131
00:05:51.567 --> 00:05:53.033
Well. I should be anywhere.

132
00:05:53.166 --> 00:05:54.700
other than doing
an audition for Ben Burton.

133
00:05:54.834 --> 00:05:56.467
[Millie] It'll be
great. I promise.

134
00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.367
Did you get the reel I sent
for his director. Luis Fuentes?

135
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.266
Yes I did. it's fantastic.

136
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.333
We should get him
to do the Hawaii episodes.

137
00:06:03.467 --> 00:06:05.633
even if-- you know--
Ben doesn't work out.

138
00:06:05.767 --> 00:06:07.367
[Millie] First.
they're a package deal.

139
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.667
And second. we're filming
in two weeks.

140
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.500
So this needs to work. be nice.

141
00:06:11.633 --> 00:06:13.133
I am always nice.

142
00:06:13.266 --> 00:06:14.934
[Millie] I can't see you.

143
00:06:15.066 --> 00:06:17.000
Did you just do air quotes
when you said that?

144
00:06:17.133 --> 00:06:18.333
Goodbye. Millie.

145
00:06:18.467 --> 00:06:20.166
What. are you nervous?

146
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.934
Nervous. me?
I dove with sharks.

147
00:06:23.066 --> 00:06:24.667
Oh. I know. I was there.

148
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.166
I was the guy in the water
next to you. screaming.

149
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.133
All I'm saying
is that. compared to that.

150
00:06:28.266 --> 00:06:29.767
this is gonna be a cakewalk.

151
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.367
All I gotta do.
is go in there.

152
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.834
and be my normal. charming self.
That's it. right?

153
00:06:35.967 --> 00:06:37.333
[claps]

154
00:06:37.467 --> 00:06:39.500
Well. being your
normal. charming self.

155
00:06:39.633 --> 00:06:41.867
is what got you fired
from this job the first time.

156
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.800
So maybe just
dial it back just a bit.

157
00:06:43.934 --> 00:06:45.033
You don't wanna get
into creative differences.

158
00:06:45.166 --> 00:06:47.500
before you even have the job.

159
00:06:47.633 --> 00:06:48.900
Okay.

160
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.700
Ben. Luis. hi.
I'm Paige Marshall.

161
00:06:53.834 --> 00:06:54.867
Paige. Ben Burton.

162
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.700
Luis Fuentes. nice to meet you.

163
00:06:56.834 --> 00:07:00.734
Luis. I saw your demo reel.
Fantastic work. loved it.

164
00:07:00.867 --> 00:07:02.800
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

165
00:07:05.367 --> 00:07:07.233
Did you get
a chance to see mine?

166
00:07:07.367 --> 00:07:09.734
Yes. thank you
for sending it in.

167
00:07:09.867 --> 00:07:11.600
So. I'm gonna talk
to Ben first.

168
00:07:11.734 --> 00:07:13.767
and then you and I can chat
afterwards. how about that?

169
00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.700
-All right. I'll be right here.
-All right. shall we?

170
00:07:15.834 --> 00:07:20.066
We shall. Hey. you look really
familiar to me. Have we met?

171
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.200
Nope. I don't think so.

172
00:07:21.333 --> 00:07:22.500
No. no. no. no. definitely.

173
00:07:22.633 --> 00:07:24.367
I've seen you somewhere before.

174
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.166
I just have
one of those faces.

175
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.100
Anyway. so you may have
noticed a lot has changed

176
00:07:29.233 --> 00:07:30.934
about the show
since you last hosted.

177
00:07:31.066 --> 00:07:34.433
For instance. instead of
doing a different location

178
00:07:34.567 --> 00:07:36.400
every episode. we now
focus all eight episodes

179
00:07:36.533 --> 00:07:38.533
of the season
on one destination.

180
00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:40.233
-Yeah. I've seen the show.
-Oh.

181
00:07:40.367 --> 00:07:42.734
Yeah. It's very. uh. in-depth.

182
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.500
Yeah. well
we think that's better

183
00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:48.033
than lacking in substance.

184
00:07:48.166 --> 00:07:50.000
Right. Ben why don't
you take a seat?

185
00:07:50.133 --> 00:07:54.867
Okay. Uh. you know what?
I'm gonna. I'm gonna stand.

186
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.333
I don't know.
I'm more of a stand guy.

187
00:07:57.467 --> 00:08:00.934
Sure. Yep. absolutely.

188
00:08:01.066 --> 00:08:03.934
I will just get
that out of your way.

189
00:08:04.066 --> 00:08:05.633
I coulda have done
that. but yeah.

190
00:08:05.767 --> 00:08:07.400
No. that's fine. I got it.

191
00:08:07.533 --> 00:08:09.600
So. thank you for coming in
on such short notice.

192
00:08:09.734 --> 00:08:11.333
Although. I guess
you're used to picking up.

193
00:08:11.467 --> 00:08:13.467
and going wherever
the audience tells you.

194
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.100
That is a common misconception.

195
00:08:15.233 --> 00:08:17.100
but yes-- we do allow
the audience to think that.

196
00:08:17.233 --> 00:08:18.166
What does that mean?

197
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.767
Well. they make suggestions

198
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.600
but I choose where
we're gonna go next.

199
00:08:21.734 --> 00:08:24.166
I thought the whole point
of Bold World was that.

200
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.266
there's no script.

201
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.100
Forget itineraries. and just go.

202
00:08:27.233 --> 00:08:28.633
Yeah. and once I choose
where we're gonna go.

203
00:08:28.767 --> 00:08:30.133
the rest is
very much off-the-cuff.

204
00:08:30.266 --> 00:08:33.133
I find that it works
a little better that way.

205
00:08:33.266 --> 00:08:36.000
Oh. okay. but on
a big show like this.

206
00:08:36.133 --> 00:08:37.834
we need to take things
a little more seriously.

207
00:08:37.967 --> 00:08:40.400
and have a plan.

208
00:08:40.533 --> 00:08:42.500
Well. what I've learned
on my little show.

209
00:08:42.633 --> 00:08:46.000
is that if we're too structured.
it kind of loses that sense

210
00:08:46.133 --> 00:08:48.300
of adventure and spontaneity.
ya know?

211
00:08:48.433 --> 00:08:50.100
You can plan for spontaneity.

212
00:08:50.233 --> 00:08:52.166
Mm... can you?
I don't think so.

213
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.767
It's like saying "working
vacation". It's an oxymoron.

214
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.500
-You can't have both.
-Sure you can.

215
00:08:56.633 --> 00:08:59.100
Just requires a little bit
of discipline.

216
00:08:59.233 --> 00:09:01.333
And where is the fun
in that? Hmm?

217
00:09:01.467 --> 00:09:02.867
I remember one time
we were shooting Bold World

218
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.800
in Costa Rica.
I saw your Costa Rica episodes.

219
00:09:05.934 --> 00:09:07.800
And while you were busy.
uh. running. screaming.

220
00:09:07.934 --> 00:09:09.800
being chased by a crocodile.

221
00:09:09.934 --> 00:09:14.033
Ah. ah. ah. I wasn't screaming.
That was Luis. I don't scream.

222
00:09:14.166 --> 00:09:16.467
Right. Uh. well.
you missed some things

223
00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.467
that every traveler should see.

224
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.734
Because you were too busy
being Mr. Danger.

225
00:09:21.867 --> 00:09:23.066
-[Ben] Uh-huh.
-[laughs]

226
00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.367
[Paige] What about Pani Popo?

227
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.500
[Ben] What about Pani Popo?

228
00:09:26.633 --> 00:09:28.467
[rapid dialing]

229
00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.633
Mike. it's Millie.

230
00:09:30.767 --> 00:09:32.867
I have something I think
the network is going

231
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.300
to want to see.

232
00:09:34.433 --> 00:09:36.333
I don't understand.

233
00:09:36.467 --> 00:09:40.033
This season in Hawaii.
you and Ben.

234
00:09:40.166 --> 00:09:41.967
will be co-hosts
for Next Destination.

235
00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.967
Explain that again?

236
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.800
The network saw the footage
of the two of you together.

237
00:09:45.934 --> 00:09:48.033
and they really enjoyed
the back and forth.

238
00:09:48.166 --> 00:09:49.967
You mean. where we argued
for 10 minutes straight?

239
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.734
Banter. they love it.

240
00:09:51.867 --> 00:09:53.367
Listen. this is
just a one-season deal.

241
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.133
So. if it goes well.

242
00:09:55.266 --> 00:09:57.233
they'll consider letting
you do it by yourself.

243
00:09:57.367 --> 00:09:59.000
Why can't he just
do it by himself?

244
00:09:59.133 --> 00:10:01.467
The network thinks
he's stronger with you.

245
00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.233
Plus. they think you can
help keep him in line.

246
00:10:04.367 --> 00:10:07.166
So now I'm his babysitter?
No. you know what. Millie?

247
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.166
I cannot host
a show again.

248
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.734
You know what
happened last time.

249
00:10:10.867 --> 00:10:12.500
Ah. that was years ago.

250
00:10:12.633 --> 00:10:14.633
-Everyone's forgotten
about that.
-I haven't.

251
00:10:14.767 --> 00:10:17.967
Paige. you're not gonna
be doing this by yourself.

252
00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.066
Ben's gonna be there.
I'm gonna be there.

253
00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.233
This is gonna go so far

254
00:10:22.367 --> 00:10:24.166
in showing that
you're a team player.

255
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.734
you are saving
Next Destination.

256
00:10:27.867 --> 00:10:30.533
And the network
is going to remember that.

257
00:10:30.667 --> 00:10:32.300
when they are deciding

258
00:10:32.433 --> 00:10:34.233
on whether or not
to pick up your new show.

259
00:10:34.367 --> 00:10:36.867
Plus. you can still do
Bold World in between seasons.

260
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.400
This is gonna be
such great publicity.

261
00:10:39.533 --> 00:10:41.400
-I'm sorry. Millie.
absolutely no.
-Hard pass.

262
00:10:43.433 --> 00:10:46.367
[upbeat music]

263
00:11:01.667 --> 00:11:02.767
[car door slams]

264
00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.934
This was a terrible idea.

265
00:11:23.066 --> 00:11:24.100
What if what happened
to me the last time

266
00:11:24.233 --> 00:11:25.867
I was on camera
happens again?

267
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.700
How could it possibly
happen again?

268
00:11:27.834 --> 00:11:30.767
We are in a Hawaii bubble
of luxury resorts.

269
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.800
and fine dining restaurants
and surfers.

270
00:11:33.934 --> 00:11:35.767
We're never gonna be
anywhere near a goat.

271
00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:39.967
Hey. whoa! Whoa. chip--
Don't say that.

272
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:44.700
Oh. no! Ay.
[laughs]

273
00:11:44.834 --> 00:11:48.266
-What are you watching?
-Oh! Luis you have
got to see this.

274
00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.867
This is the greatest thing

275
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.934
in the history of
the world. watch that.

276
00:11:52.066 --> 00:11:54.300
[Paige] Here I am at
the Dunfield Goat Farm.

277
00:11:54.433 --> 00:11:55.800
a great destination
for the whole family.
[giggling]

278
00:11:55.934 --> 00:11:57.467
Just wait.

279
00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.133
And here we have a little
group of goats right now here.

280
00:12:01.266 --> 00:12:03.433
So you-- Oh!
[laughs]

281
00:12:03.567 --> 00:12:06.433
No! Stay back!
Don't. don't. don't! Help!

282
00:12:06.567 --> 00:12:08.734
[goat screaming]

283
00:12:10.166 --> 00:12:12.367
I knew it. I knew
I recognized her!

284
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:13.767
The minute I saw her.
I knew it.

285
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.700
This video has 10 million views.

286
00:12:15.834 --> 00:12:18.133
I'm gonna make it 11.
Oh...

287
00:12:18.266 --> 00:12:20.166
Ben. this isn't funny.

288
00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:21.967
What. not funny?

289
00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.300
She's been chased
by screaming goats.

290
00:12:24.433 --> 00:12:26.867
Luis. I'm gonna level
with you. pal.
you were right.

291
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.867
I was nervous
about this gig.

292
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.133
because it's been a long time
since I've done this kinda job.

293
00:12:31.266 --> 00:12:36.000
And I was a little worried.
about looking like a joke.

294
00:12:36.133 --> 00:12:38.867
But now with this. now
I know I'm not the only one.

295
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.467
who got caught on camera
making a fool of themselves.

296
00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.934
I'll show everybody some
of my most embarrassing clips.

297
00:12:44.066 --> 00:12:45.467
I'm a big laugh.
it will be great.

298
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.133
Ben. listen to me.
this isn't Bold World.

299
00:12:48.266 --> 00:12:50.967
Oh. man.
You're not by yourself anymore.

300
00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:52.467
You have to learn
how to be a team player.

301
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.767
Bringing up the goat lady.

302
00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.767
is absolutely not
the way to do that.

303
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.633
So. promise me?

304
00:12:58.767 --> 00:13:00.133
Fine. I promise.

305
00:13:06.066 --> 00:13:07.934
[upbeat music]

306
00:13:08.066 --> 00:13:10.367
[giggling]

307
00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.266
-Hey!
-[goat screaming]

308
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.033
Hello. what's so funny?

309
00:13:19.166 --> 00:13:23.333
Nothing. Nothing's funny.
just videos. watching videos.

310
00:13:23.467 --> 00:13:25.867
Silly videos
of uh... cats.

311
00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.266
-Cats on skateboards.
-High comedy.

312
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.367
Yes. Yep. I see
you're going to get ice.

313
00:13:33.834 --> 00:13:35.834
Uh. yeah.
Ordered some room service.

314
00:13:35.967 --> 00:13:38.600
Now I'm going
to watch a documentary
about Muhammad Ali.

315
00:13:38.734 --> 00:13:43.233
Oh. great. the champ.
The original G.O.A.T.

316
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.000
A goat. like G.O.A.T.?
"Greatest of All Time."

317
00:13:47.133 --> 00:13:48.567
Kids are saying it
all the time.

318
00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.200
Sort of a saying.
I got a headache.
I gotta go.

319
00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.333
[upbeat music]

320
00:13:56.467 --> 00:13:58.166
[sighs]

321
00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:01.266
Okay. we are on
a tight schedule. people.

322
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.266
We do an episode
every two to three days.

323
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.967
and we do them in order.

324
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:09.000
So that means overview
first. resort second.

325
00:14:09.133 --> 00:14:11.000
restaurants third.
et cetera.

326
00:14:11.133 --> 00:14:13.400
and Ben-- question.

327
00:14:13.533 --> 00:14:15.967
Yes. I was just
wondering what we do.

328
00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.934
if we come across like
a really great opportunity.

329
00:14:18.066 --> 00:14:19.500
I mean. I remember
this one time.

330
00:14:19.633 --> 00:14:20.800
Remember when we came
across that place?

331
00:14:20.934 --> 00:14:22.567
I think it was Spain.
and that lady--

332
00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.133
So we save two days at
the end. for any re-shoots.

333
00:14:24.266 --> 00:14:26.400
or to add anything
we need-- Trust me.

334
00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:27.767
We know what we're doing.

335
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.100
-I'm just--
-That makes total sense.

336
00:14:30.233 --> 00:14:33.600
And we're both very happy
to be on the team. right. Ben?

337
00:14:33.734 --> 00:14:36.800
Yep. Yep. super-happy to be
on the team. very excited.

338
00:14:36.934 --> 00:14:39.934
Okay. great. well have
a terrific season. everyone.

339
00:14:40.066 --> 00:14:42.633
-[claps]
-Yay. all right.

340
00:14:42.767 --> 00:14:44.133
Okay. just like
we rehearsed it.

341
00:14:44.266 --> 00:14:46.467
Ben. opening lines.
welcome to Hawaii.

342
00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.233
Then you're gonna
sweep your arms out

343
00:14:48.367 --> 00:14:49.800
and reveal the beautiful view.

344
00:14:49.934 --> 00:14:51.767
-Yep.
-Absolutely. we can do this.

345
00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:53.400
Oh. ah...

346
00:14:53.533 --> 00:14:55.000
Ben. do you need more time
with your lines?

347
00:14:55.133 --> 00:14:56.967
I know you missed
a few during rehearsal.

348
00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:00.300
No. no. no. no. It's not
that I just. I don't know.

349
00:15:00.433 --> 00:15:03.166
should we change it up
a little. don't you think?

350
00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.133
Change it up how. why?

351
00:15:05.266 --> 00:15:09.734
Well. if I'm being honest.
I felt a little flat. Right?

352
00:15:09.867 --> 00:15:12.867
I mean. maybe
we should improvise.

353
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
We don't improvise.
that's why we've got a script.

354
00:15:15.133 --> 00:15:16.533
Right. Millie?

355
00:15:16.667 --> 00:15:18.300
But sometimes you get
really great stuff.

356
00:15:18.433 --> 00:15:19.867
when you don't stick
to the script. right Luis?

357
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.333
Uhhhh...

358
00:15:21.467 --> 00:15:23.200
Okay. a lot of research
has gone into this.

359
00:15:23.333 --> 00:15:25.133
so we need to do it
the way it's written.

360
00:15:25.266 --> 00:15:28.367
[scoffs] Come on.
let's just give it
a try. see what happens.

361
00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.533
Unless. of course. you have
something against fun.

362
00:15:31.834 --> 00:15:36.333
Nope. sure. let's give it a go.

363
00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:40.400
Okay. baba baba baba.
wawawa.

364
00:15:40.533 --> 00:15:41.834
[Luis]
All right. you look great.

365
00:15:41.967 --> 00:15:44.800
-Great big smiles.
-And... action!

366
00:15:44.934 --> 00:15:47.033
-Hey everybody. welcome to...
-I'm Paige Marshall--

367
00:15:47.166 --> 00:15:48.400
Okay! Still rolling.

368
00:15:48.533 --> 00:15:50.867
Mm-hmm. Okay. here we go.
here it comes.

369
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.633
-Hey everyone. I'm Ben Burton.
-This beautiful scene--

370
00:15:53.767 --> 00:15:56.133
Hey. we're relaxing.
we're having fun.

371
00:15:56.266 --> 00:15:58.166
Yeah. but I'm not having fun.
Is anyone having fun?

372
00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.567
Can we just go back to
the script? Please. Millie?

373
00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:02.633
Okay. yes. let's do that.

374
00:16:02.767 --> 00:16:05.300
Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.
God. that script.

375
00:16:05.433 --> 00:16:07.133
Still rolling. go ahead.

376
00:16:07.266 --> 00:16:12.233
Stunning beaches. luxurious
resorts. bustling nightlife.

377
00:16:12.367 --> 00:16:15.300
-You missed "incredible food"?
-What now?

378
00:16:15.433 --> 00:16:18.967
Would you say "incredible food"?
I say "bustling nightlife".

379
00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:22.433
sunny beaches. luxurious
resorts. incredible food.

380
00:16:22.567 --> 00:16:23.967
-Do you wanna take a look?
-No. I'm good.

381
00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.934
Okay. when you're ready.

382
00:16:26.066 --> 00:16:27.867
Still exciting. here it comes.

383
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.767
Do you wanna count us in?
[exhales]

384
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:33.200
[I'll just take it
on my own. here we go.

385
00:16:33.333 --> 00:16:38.934
Stunning beaches. luxurious
resorts. delicious food.

386
00:16:39.066 --> 00:16:41.400
Bustling nightlife.
colorful local culture.

387
00:16:41.533 --> 00:16:44.200
and some of the most beautiful
scenery in the world.

388
00:16:44.333 --> 00:16:46.767
I'm Ben Burton--
...and I'm Paige Marshall.

389
00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:50.100
And this is our...

390
00:16:50.233 --> 00:16:53.900
This is our Next Destination.

391
00:16:54.033 --> 00:16:55.934
I was thinking about that "our".
Should the "our" be a "your"?

392
00:16:56.066 --> 00:16:57.700
What?

393
00:16:57.834 --> 00:16:59.367
Right now we're saying
"our" next destination.

394
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.200
but if we say "your".
then it makes the audience

395
00:17:01.333 --> 00:17:04.333
feel like
we're taking them along
for the ride. right?

396
00:17:04.467 --> 00:17:06.767
Todd always said our.
"Our next destination."

397
00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.200
That's how it's always been
on the show.

398
00:17:08.333 --> 00:17:10.367
We're not Todd.

399
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.700
Okay. well this is what you get.
for trying to have a little fun.

400
00:17:12.834 --> 00:17:15.133
Oh. I'm so sorry. I forgot
we didn't have time to have fun.

401
00:17:15.266 --> 00:17:18.000
[sighs]
This is gonna be
a long three weeks.

402
00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.033
Yeah.

403
00:17:26.266 --> 00:17:27.400
[Millie] Don't worry.
we can fix this.

404
00:17:27.533 --> 00:17:29.133
Great. who are the new hosts?

405
00:17:29.266 --> 00:17:31.567
Listen one of the reasons why
you are such a great producer.

406
00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.734
is that you know
how to put out fires.

407
00:17:33.867 --> 00:17:35.367
So now Ben and me
hosting together.

408
00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:36.867
has become
such a disaster.

409
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.934
It's a blaze
I have to extinguish?

410
00:17:39.066 --> 00:17:40.300
I didn't say it's a blaze.

411
00:17:40.433 --> 00:17:43.133
Small fire.
a little bit of smoke.

412
00:17:43.266 --> 00:17:45.367
I should just quit before
it burns the whole house down.

413
00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.400
The network thinks
the show is gonna be stronger

414
00:17:47.533 --> 00:17:49.867
with the both of you. and
you're not gonna quit this one.

415
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.767
I don't know. maybe
I'll just live here
in a hut.

416
00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.633
selling seashells
by the seashore.

417
00:17:54.767 --> 00:17:57.800
[laughs] How cute-- no!
What you need to do.

418
00:17:57.934 --> 00:18:01.400
is talk to Ben and find out
his point of view on this.

419
00:18:04.633 --> 00:18:08.800
Okay. lets have it.
you were behind the camera.

420
00:18:08.934 --> 00:18:10.600
what do you think?

421
00:18:10.734 --> 00:18:13.200
That I'm smart enough not
to tell the hosts of the show.

422
00:18:13.333 --> 00:18:15.200
what I really thought
of their performance?

423
00:18:15.333 --> 00:18:16.967
That bad. huh?

424
00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.300
At least you should understand
where she's coming from.

425
00:18:19.433 --> 00:18:22.934
Fair enough. I guess
I should talk to her.

426
00:18:23.066 --> 00:18:25.033
Tell her that I'll try
to be more considerate

427
00:18:25.166 --> 00:18:26.633
of how she works.

428
00:18:26.767 --> 00:18:29.000
Yeah. easy. I can do that.
That's a good idea.

429
00:18:29.133 --> 00:18:32.033
Thanks. Luis.
See you later. bud.

430
00:18:32.166 --> 00:18:34.500
That's okay.
I'll get the check.

431
00:18:36.433 --> 00:18:38.500
[Ben]
Thank you for the walk with me.

432
00:18:38.633 --> 00:18:41.533
Yes. we've got
a couple of hours off.

433
00:18:41.667 --> 00:18:43.367
and I wanted to
talk to you as well.

434
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.367
Good. okay. well. I'll go
first if you don't mind.

435
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:50.333
Obviously we got off
on the wrong foot.

436
00:18:50.467 --> 00:18:53.333
And I think. because we have
to work with each other.

437
00:18:53.467 --> 00:18:56.767
we should really try and
get in step with each other.

438
00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.633
Put out the fire.
so to speak.

439
00:18:58.767 --> 00:19:00.100
I completely agree.

440
00:19:00.233 --> 00:19:03.000
Exactly. we agree. Progress.

441
00:19:03.133 --> 00:19:05.367
Now the million-dollar
question is.

442
00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.500
-what do we do about it?
-Yeah.

443
00:19:08.633 --> 00:19:11.567
Well. like you said.
we have a little bit of time.

444
00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.033
We can go explore.
We could rent a car.

445
00:19:14.166 --> 00:19:16.233
Oh. I don't know
if we should--

446
00:19:16.367 --> 00:19:18.967
Come on. where's
your sense of adventure?

447
00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:22.600
Look. we just--
We go for a drive.

448
00:19:22.734 --> 00:19:27.934
We see some sites. you know?
Blow off some steam.
back in an hour.

449
00:19:28.066 --> 00:19:29.867
Where would we go?

450
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.033
I don't know.
we'll figure it out.

451
00:19:32.166 --> 00:19:35.834
[sighs]
Look. I realize this
isn't your thing.

452
00:19:35.967 --> 00:19:37.533
But it could be fun.

453
00:19:37.667 --> 00:19:40.367
Maybe if we spend a little bit
of time together off-camera.

454
00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.200
it'll help us on camera.

455
00:19:44.467 --> 00:19:46.400
-One hour.
-Yeah.

456
00:19:46.533 --> 00:19:48.166
And then we come back to work.

457
00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:52.333
Absolutely. Synchronizing
watches. One hour. let's go.

458
00:19:52.467 --> 00:19:54.066
-[chuckles]
-[dramatic music]

459
00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.333
[Ben] So you go first.
where are you from.

460
00:19:56.467 --> 00:19:59.367
parents. siblings first pet.

461
00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.000
My dad worked for the city.

462
00:20:01.133 --> 00:20:04.433
My mom was a teacher.
one sibling. a sister. younger.

463
00:20:04.567 --> 00:20:10.266
married with two--
soon to be three-- kids.
and. ah. Melvin.

464
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.367
-Alright. your turn.
-Okay. let's see.

465
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:18.033
From Calgary. Alberta. my father
was an insurance salesman.

466
00:20:18.166 --> 00:20:20.533
My mom was
a stay-home seamstress.

467
00:20:20.667 --> 00:20:21.867
and I kept her pretty busy.

468
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.734
with all
the tears in my clothes.

469
00:20:23.867 --> 00:20:26.033
Um. and Harry the turtle.

470
00:20:26.166 --> 00:20:28.600
Your favorite pet was a turtle?
Yeah.

471
00:20:28.734 --> 00:20:30.700
Yeah. he was great.
played fetch and everything.

472
00:20:30.834 --> 00:20:32.700
That's a terrible joke.

473
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.600
[gentle music]

474
00:20:35.734 --> 00:20:38.834
Paige. where are you. call me.

475
00:20:38.967 --> 00:20:40.867
What are you gonna do
until they get back?

476
00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:45.934
[upbeat music]

477
00:20:55.834 --> 00:20:58.000
-No service.
-Okay. which way?

478
00:20:58.133 --> 00:20:59.734
Well. if we stick
to the main road.

479
00:20:59.867 --> 00:21:01.500
that's gonna take us
back to the resort. so.

480
00:21:01.633 --> 00:21:02.934
Yeah. I think so.

481
00:21:03.066 --> 00:21:04.734
If we go that way.

482
00:21:04.867 --> 00:21:07.400
I believe that'll take us
to the other side of the island.

483
00:21:07.533 --> 00:21:10.467
So I wonder where that one goes.

484
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:13.133
Should we find out?

485
00:21:13.266 --> 00:21:14.667
Uh. we should really
be getting back.

486
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.500
You said one hour.
I demand my full hour.

487
00:21:18.633 --> 00:21:20.467
All right. but only
for a few more minutes.

488
00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:23.133
Millie is gonna freak out
if we are not back soon.

489
00:21:23.266 --> 00:21:26.767
-We'll be back.
-[engine revving]

490
00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:30.433
-Ben. where are you?
-Paige. please call me back.

491
00:21:30.567 --> 00:21:33.166
I'm sure everything's fine.
they just lost track of time.

492
00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:34.767
-You think?
-I don't know.

493
00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.800
-Wha'?
-[upbeat music]

494
00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.967
Thank you so much. thank you.

495
00:21:45.533 --> 00:21:49.333
-So. you're from New York?
-Arkansas.

496
00:21:49.467 --> 00:21:50.500
I don't know where that is.

497
00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.100
[birds chirping]

498
00:21:54.233 --> 00:21:57.300
Hey. did you know. there
are 137 Hawaiian islands.

499
00:21:57.433 --> 00:21:59.133
not just the seven
inhabited ones?

500
00:21:59.266 --> 00:22:01.834
Well. do any of them have cell
service on deserted roads?

501
00:22:01.967 --> 00:22:03.667
Because maybe that would
have been a better place

502
00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:06.233
to get a flat tire on a vehicle
that doesn't have a spare.

503
00:22:06.367 --> 00:22:07.800
Yeah. there it is.

504
00:22:07.934 --> 00:22:09.500
The "I told you so."
I knew it was coming.

505
00:22:09.633 --> 00:22:11.667
I didn't say anything.

506
00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.033
But if I was gonna say
something. I would say.

507
00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:16.133
"I told you we should've
stayed on the main road."

508
00:22:16.266 --> 00:22:17.867
I thought it would be fun!

509
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.400
[laughing]
Well. I'm having fun.
this is so much fun.

510
00:22:21.533 --> 00:22:23.233
It's kinda like
an amusement park.

511
00:22:23.367 --> 00:22:28.000
except. without the rides.
or the food. or... anything!

512
00:22:28.133 --> 00:22:30.800
Just try to think of it
as an adventure. okay?

513
00:22:30.934 --> 00:22:32.800
Granted. sometimes
it doesn't work out.

514
00:22:32.934 --> 00:22:34.967
but when it does...
I remember one time--

515
00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.734
No. no. no. no. no.
no more with the.

516
00:22:37.867 --> 00:22:40.066
"I remember one time--"
I can't.

517
00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.900
The car rental guy
mentioned zip lining.

518
00:22:42.033 --> 00:22:44.133
"I remember one time."
Crocodile wrestling?

519
00:22:44.266 --> 00:22:46.000
"I remember one time.
I remember one time."

520
00:22:46.133 --> 00:22:47.066
"I remember one time!"

521
00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.033
I never wrestled the crocodile.

522
00:22:49.166 --> 00:22:51.400
Right. I forgot.
You ran away screaming.

523
00:22:51.533 --> 00:22:53.233
That was Luis.

524
00:22:53.367 --> 00:22:55.800
And oh. I'm sorry.
I forgot the crocodiles.

525
00:22:55.934 --> 00:22:57.800
weren't as scary as goats.

526
00:22:57.934 --> 00:22:59.934
[suspense music]

527
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.767
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
said that. that was mean.

528
00:23:05.567 --> 00:23:08.233
Hey. hey. hey.
where are you going?

529
00:23:08.367 --> 00:23:09.633
Anywhere you're not.

530
00:23:10.734 --> 00:23:13.633
[birds chirping]

531
00:23:13.767 --> 00:23:16.867
Look. I've done tons of
embarrassing stuff on camera.

532
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.567
I remember one time. I...

533
00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:22.433
Sorry. force of habit.
Mm-hmm.

534
00:23:22.567 --> 00:23:24.700
Look. all I'm saying is that.

535
00:23:24.834 --> 00:23:27.533
you just need to learn to.
I don't know. laugh it off.

536
00:23:27.667 --> 00:23:28.800
Well. I think everyone
else has done

537
00:23:28.934 --> 00:23:31.400
quite a bit of laughing
on my behalf.

538
00:23:31.533 --> 00:23:34.266
You don't understand.
people have come up to me.

539
00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.633
random people. for years.
and would just go. "Ba-a-ah"!

540
00:23:37.767 --> 00:23:39.800
Or they just scream
out of nowhere.

541
00:23:39.934 --> 00:23:42.100
[laughs]

542
00:23:42.233 --> 00:23:44.333
It's not funny. I actually
don't think it's funny.

543
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.567
You're right.

544
00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:47.934
You're absolutely right.
it's not funny.

545
00:23:48.066 --> 00:23:49.467
It's just that. I mean.

546
00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.066
everybody makes a fool
of themselves at some point.

547
00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.133
Yap. but not everybody
has a video of it.

548
00:23:54.266 --> 00:23:56.133
that's been seen
by 9 million people.

549
00:23:56.266 --> 00:24:01.133
Be more like 10 now. but I
saw all their videos of you.

550
00:24:01.266 --> 00:24:03.467
You know. when you were at
work. and you looked good.

551
00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:06.433
You were.
You were charming.

552
00:24:06.567 --> 00:24:08.767
Before all
the screaming goats.

553
00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.633
Is that what. uh. made
you become a producer?

554
00:24:13.633 --> 00:24:15.600
I saw Millie a couple
of times on assignment.

555
00:24:15.734 --> 00:24:18.166
and then I ran into her
after you'd left the show.

556
00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:19.700
She needed a producer.

557
00:24:19.834 --> 00:24:22.333
and I thought. well.
I needed a fresh start. so...

558
00:24:22.467 --> 00:24:26.500
You don't miss it? Being
in front of a camera.
going out on the road?

559
00:24:26.633 --> 00:24:29.033
No. not at all.

560
00:24:29.166 --> 00:24:30.500
So why did you agree
to be the co-host.

561
00:24:30.633 --> 00:24:33.166
of Next Destination?

562
00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:36.166
I pitched my own show.
It didn't work.

563
00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.600
Millie says. by doing this.

564
00:24:38.734 --> 00:24:41.033
I might make them
think more favorably.

565
00:24:41.166 --> 00:24:43.367
And that's it?

566
00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:47.133
Yeah. that's it.
Hmm.

567
00:24:47.266 --> 00:24:50.266
I just thought that.
uh. maybe there
is a reason.

568
00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.233
that the gig. like. may be
a shot at redemption.

569
00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:58.200
-[footsteps on gravel]
-[birds chirping]

570
00:24:58.333 --> 00:25:00.767
[Paige] Millie is gonna kill us.
[sighs]

571
00:25:01.967 --> 00:25:03.767
Then I came too and I thought.

572
00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:08.834
there's no way I'm ever
swimming with sharks again.

573
00:25:08.967 --> 00:25:12.066
Oh. Luis. no bueno.

574
00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.200
[sighs] Yeah.

575
00:25:15.333 --> 00:25:17.200
Have you heard from him yet?

576
00:25:17.333 --> 00:25:18.700
Well. I thought you were
checking your phone.

577
00:25:22.567 --> 00:25:23.400
[thudding]

578
00:25:23.533 --> 00:25:25.734
-Nothing.
-Nope.

579
00:25:28.834 --> 00:25:34.200
We should really get to work
on rescheduling this day.

580
00:25:35.166 --> 00:25:36.934
Oh. a hundred percent.

581
00:25:37.066 --> 00:25:39.567
[dramatic music]

582
00:25:41.333 --> 00:25:43.767
Oh. Mahalo!

583
00:25:48.633 --> 00:25:50.033
Do you think I have feelings?

584
00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:55.867
Well. sadly he doesn't get
reception out here either.

585
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.533
but he said he would drive
us back to the resort

586
00:25:57.667 --> 00:26:01.467
when he's done.
in about 30 minutes.

587
00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:06.133
So. we have a choice to
make. we either keep walking.

588
00:26:06.266 --> 00:26:07.600
or...

589
00:26:10.533 --> 00:26:12.166
we eat some pineapple.

590
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:15.266
-I love pineapple.
-I love pineapple. too.

591
00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.400
All right. maybe it's nice.
let me see if I can...

592
00:26:18.533 --> 00:26:22.500
Oh. also. I found
out that his brother.

593
00:26:22.633 --> 00:26:25.934
runs the scuba shop.
next to our resort.

594
00:26:26.066 --> 00:26:28.934
So we could do
a little snorkeling.

595
00:26:29.066 --> 00:26:34.133
Ben. we have all our
recreation segments planned.

596
00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:39.166
I know. it's just that...
Never mind.

597
00:26:40.633 --> 00:26:42.133
No. what?

598
00:26:42.266 --> 00:26:43.567
Its just that. that's
one of the reasons.

599
00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.066
why I left them
in the first place.

600
00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.800
You know. with Todd.

601
00:26:46.934 --> 00:26:49.100
He was just so
flattened by the book.

602
00:26:49.233 --> 00:26:51.100
You left because you didn't
get your way all the time.

603
00:26:51.233 --> 00:26:52.600
What are you. 12?

604
00:26:52.734 --> 00:26:53.834
I wasn't joking when
I said I like videos

605
00:26:53.967 --> 00:26:55.467
of cats on skateboards.

606
00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.166
Hey you couldn't
have always had jobs.

607
00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:59.900
that allowed you to do whatever
it is you wanted to do.

608
00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:01.734
So what did you do before?

609
00:27:01.867 --> 00:27:03.734
Well. I started at a little
local station in Chicago.

610
00:27:03.867 --> 00:27:05.300
Mm-hmm.

611
00:27:05.433 --> 00:27:07.233
Kinda fell into the whole
Adventure Travel thing.

612
00:27:07.367 --> 00:27:09.567
because I was the guy who
was willing to do anything

613
00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:10.667
no matter how crazy.

614
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.133
Thanks to crocodiles.

615
00:27:12.266 --> 00:27:14.166
Yeah. but I got to
do my own segments.

616
00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:16.033
That was the thing.

617
00:27:16.166 --> 00:27:19.900
But when I went to network.
it just didn't work.

618
00:27:20.033 --> 00:27:22.867
So. Millie and I. we chalked
it up to creative differences.

619
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.233
and that was that--
I went and did my own show.

620
00:27:25.367 --> 00:27:28.633
You never missed
having a regular gig?

621
00:27:28.767 --> 00:27:30.967
Mm... No.

622
00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.066
Then. why did you?

623
00:27:34.433 --> 00:27:36.734
I don't know.

624
00:27:36.867 --> 00:27:39.100
I guess maybe I wanted
a shot at redemption. too.

625
00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:42.734
Hmm.

626
00:27:42.867 --> 00:27:45.200
You think we'll be able to?

627
00:27:45.333 --> 00:27:47.734
Redeem ourselves. that is?

628
00:27:47.867 --> 00:27:51.667
Well. if you can get over being
chased by screaming goats.

629
00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:55.567
I figure I can probably
learn to follow a script.

630
00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:56.900
At least a little bit.

631
00:27:57.033 --> 00:27:58.633
Just promise me.

632
00:27:58.767 --> 00:28:00.700
I get
to do more than stand
and point at things.

633
00:28:00.834 --> 00:28:02.433
Never fun for you?

634
00:28:02.567 --> 00:28:04.100
No. it's not that.
I'm really bad at it.

635
00:28:04.233 --> 00:28:06.266
Look. ground. sky-- terrible.

636
00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.667
-[laughs]
-[birds chirping]

637
00:28:12.066 --> 00:28:15.133
c]

638
00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:22.367
All right. so we are
starting with the overview.

639
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:23.700
of the water activities.

640
00:28:23.834 --> 00:28:25.633
Scuba. snorkeling. surfing.

641
00:28:25.767 --> 00:28:27.667
Uh. I wanna make
sure I got this right.

642
00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.033
So we're gonna talk
about these things

643
00:28:30.166 --> 00:28:33.500
but not actually do
any of them. is that right?

644
00:28:33.633 --> 00:28:35.533
This is where the pointing
skills come in handy.

645
00:28:35.667 --> 00:28:38.300
Right. okay. well.
let's see I could point.

646
00:28:38.433 --> 00:28:40.100
I don't know. there.

647
00:28:40.233 --> 00:28:41.934
Hey. look. it's Kako's
Brothers scuba shack.

648
00:28:42.066 --> 00:28:43.834
The guy that drove
us back to the hotel.

649
00:28:43.967 --> 00:28:46.133
we could go snorkeling
will be so much fun.

650
00:28:46.266 --> 00:28:49.033
Okay. for starters. this
is the overview episode.

651
00:28:49.166 --> 00:28:52.266
not the actual
recreation episode.

652
00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.166
So it's easier
and more efficient.

653
00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:56.500
-we just stay on the beach.
-Hey. it easier. sure.

654
00:28:56.633 --> 00:28:58.100
But not nearly as much fun.

655
00:28:58.233 --> 00:28:59.934
And just because
it's the overview.

656
00:29:00.133 --> 00:29:02.734
doesn't mean we can't
do anything. right?

657
00:29:02.867 --> 00:29:04.567
Luis. help me out here. man.

658
00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.700
We are pressed
for time. but shots
of you two in the water

659
00:29:06.834 --> 00:29:08.200
would be pretty great.

660
00:29:08.333 --> 00:29:10.166
We're already
running behind. so--

661
00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:11.900
Okay. you're just gonna
go into the water.

662
00:29:12.033 --> 00:29:13.233
and you're gonna splash
around a little bit.

663
00:29:13.367 --> 00:29:14.433
and that's really cute.

664
00:29:18.533 --> 00:29:19.967
We're gonna...
splish-splash a little bit.

665
00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:24.934
Paige. we said we'd try
and work together. right?

666
00:29:26.867 --> 00:29:28.533
Yep. yep.

667
00:29:28.667 --> 00:29:30.567
Okay good. I'm gonna
get my suit.

668
00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.400
And action.

669
00:29:33.533 --> 00:29:35.400
Hey. everybody. welcome
back to Next Destination.

670
00:29:35.533 --> 00:29:37.433
and our overview of Hawaii.

671
00:29:37.567 --> 00:29:39.367
Now. no trip here
would be complete.

672
00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.767
without exploring the incredible
water opportunities.

673
00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:43.100
that the islands offer.

674
00:29:43.233 --> 00:29:46.734
We are literally
surrounded by it.

675
00:29:46.867 --> 00:29:48.900
Usually how an island works.

676
00:29:49.033 --> 00:29:51.100
Ha-ha. so funny.

677
00:29:51.233 --> 00:29:52.667
Now. in our recreation episode.

678
00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:55.000
we will be taking a deeper dive.

679
00:29:55.133 --> 00:29:57.734
Oh. I see what you did
there. very clever.

680
00:29:57.867 --> 00:30:00.100
Thanks for keeping up.
Mm-hmm.

681
00:30:00.233 --> 00:30:01.767
Okay. on that note.
I thought maybe

682
00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:05.400
we'd give you a little
sneak preview. you ready?

683
00:30:05.533 --> 00:30:07.400
-Let's do it.
-Let's do it.

684
00:30:10.133 --> 00:30:13.233
[upbeat music]

685
00:30:15.667 --> 00:30:18.100
[water bubbling]

686
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.700
[upbeat music]

687
00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:35.433
[laughs]

688
00:30:35.567 --> 00:30:37.734
[claps]

689
00:30:44.367 --> 00:30:45.700
-Hi.
-Hi.

690
00:30:47.133 --> 00:30:48.500
[laughs]

691
00:30:48.633 --> 00:30:50.266
So. um. I wanted to...

692
00:30:53.667 --> 00:30:59.934
apologize for. well.
pushing back on...

693
00:31:00.133 --> 00:31:02.166
all of your ideas.

694
00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.066
Our bosses are pretty strict

695
00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:08.100
with how we do things. but
they do allow us some freedom.

696
00:31:10.266 --> 00:31:11.967
Snorkeling was
a really good idea today.

697
00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:14.900
Well. thank you.

698
00:31:15.033 --> 00:31:20.066
But the truth is. I am the one
who should probably apologize.

699
00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.233
for pushing so hard for changes.

700
00:31:22.367 --> 00:31:24.333
I realize that
we have deadlines.

701
00:31:24.467 --> 00:31:26.834
and that we have
a schedule to keep to.

702
00:31:26.967 --> 00:31:29.834
And I will endeavor
to be more...

703
00:31:32.233 --> 00:31:35.567
respectful of that. I'm sorry.

704
00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:36.633
Thank you.

705
00:31:36.767 --> 00:31:39.600
No. no. no thank you.

706
00:31:39.734 --> 00:31:41.400
[laughs]

707
00:31:41.533 --> 00:31:44.633
Look at us. being all
professional and mature.

708
00:31:44.767 --> 00:31:45.967
I'm very impressed with us.

709
00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:49.000
-Who wouldn't be?
-[laughs]

710
00:31:51.734 --> 00:31:53.400
Well. I'll see you tomorrow.

711
00:31:53.533 --> 00:31:55.567
Yes. you will.
Good night.

712
00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:56.834
Good night.

713
00:31:58.533 --> 00:32:01.567
-[wind roaring]
-[chuckles]

714
00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:03.667
We hope you enjoyed
our overview

715
00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:07.133
of what's to come this season
on Next Destination: Hawaii.

716
00:32:07.266 --> 00:32:09.400
Join us next week. as
we explore the best hotels.

717
00:32:09.533 --> 00:32:11.166
and resorts on the island.

718
00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:13.500
The kinds of places Paige
is gonna post pictures of.

719
00:32:13.633 --> 00:32:15.800
to make her friends jealous.

720
00:32:15.934 --> 00:32:17.000
That's what you do
when you have friends.

721
00:32:17.133 --> 00:32:19.066
instead of just followers.

722
00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:23.367
-Ooh! Slay!
-I'm Paige Marshall.

723
00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:26.533
And I'm Ben Burton.
see you next time.

724
00:32:26.667 --> 00:32:28.066
And cut. right.

725
00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.800
That's a wrap
on our overview episode.

726
00:32:29.934 --> 00:32:32.300
Paige Marshall
steps up to the plate

727
00:32:32.433 --> 00:32:36.467
-and slams it out of the park.
-[laughs]

728
00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:39.166
You have got to stop
going off script.

729
00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:41.133
Sound advice. I'll be
sure to write that down

730
00:32:41.266 --> 00:32:42.967
in my script.

731
00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:46.300
Nice work!
Good job. lucky for you.
[laughs]

732
00:32:46.433 --> 00:32:47.734
Well. that was good.

733
00:32:47.867 --> 00:32:49.333
You guys are getting
the hang of it.

734
00:32:49.467 --> 00:32:51.400
Yep. yeah I'm learning
to hide my panic.

735
00:32:51.533 --> 00:32:53.633
every time he improvises.

736
00:32:53.767 --> 00:32:55.300
Well. we finished
the overview episode.

737
00:32:55.433 --> 00:32:56.734
that's progress. isn't it?

738
00:32:56.867 --> 00:33:01.266
Yep. took us three days.
normally takes us two.

739
00:33:02.166 --> 00:33:04.300
Quality takes time?

740
00:33:04.433 --> 00:33:07.166
-Sure.
-[gentle music]

741
00:33:11.266 --> 00:33:13.400
[shutter clicks]

742
00:33:13.533 --> 00:33:14.767
You like the water so much.

743
00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:16.367
are you thinking of
taking up surfing?

744
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.066
[chuckles] No. I'm
doing some research

745
00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.900
for our recreation episode.

746
00:33:20.033 --> 00:33:21.800
Did you want something?

747
00:33:21.934 --> 00:33:24.533
So I met this cab driver
named Leilani. and
her cousin is opening

748
00:33:24.667 --> 00:33:26.100
this really cool zip line
attraction in a few weeks?

749
00:33:26.233 --> 00:33:28.033
We're not gonna be
here in a weeks.

750
00:33:28.166 --> 00:33:30.400
I do realize that. but
they're doing test runs today.

751
00:33:30.533 --> 00:33:32.200
and she said that
we could film a segment.

752
00:33:32.333 --> 00:33:34.066
But only today. because
then they're gonna be too busy

753
00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.734
getting ready to open.

754
00:33:35.867 --> 00:33:38.567
Ben. we already have
everything booked for today.

755
00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:41.066
We're filming on location
at three different resorts.

756
00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.533
And then we've got
the sunset sail boat cruise.

757
00:33:42.667 --> 00:33:45.367
Paige. come on.
a sunset cruise?

758
00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.266
Boat trip to see something
that happens literally

759
00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.900
every single day. or zip
lining through the tree tops.

760
00:33:50.033 --> 00:33:51.400
This is fun. this is boring.

761
00:33:51.533 --> 00:33:54.934
Ben. I trusted you
with the snorkeling.

762
00:33:55.066 --> 00:33:56.467
That's true. you did.

763
00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.467
I think you gotta
trust me on this one.

764
00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:03.700
[sighs]
Okay. you're right. open mind.

765
00:34:03.834 --> 00:34:05.367
-It's okay.
-Sorry.

766
00:34:08.133 --> 00:34:09.867
[laughs]

767
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.333
There you go. thanks so much.
Okay. see ya.

768
00:34:12.467 --> 00:34:15.967
-Whoo!
-Fan of Bold World?

769
00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:18.500
Yeah. kinda... she wanted
a picture of you too.

770
00:34:18.633 --> 00:34:21.467
-Oh...
-She thought we were a couple.

771
00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.333
Oh.

772
00:34:23.467 --> 00:34:25.800
I know. I told her I tend not to
date women that don't like me.

773
00:34:25.934 --> 00:34:27.667
I don't dislike you.
Well...

774
00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.600
I don't. I don't. you just--

775
00:34:29.734 --> 00:34:32.967
you and I.
we're just very different.

776
00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:35.834
So we may not always get along.

777
00:34:35.967 --> 00:34:37.533
True. but it makes
for good TV.

778
00:34:37.667 --> 00:34:40.333
[chuckles] Hopefully.

779
00:34:40.467 --> 00:34:42.000
Is there a woman in your life.

780
00:34:42.133 --> 00:34:44.834
that doesn't dislike you?

781
00:34:44.967 --> 00:34:48.033
That doesn't dislike me?
Uhh...

782
00:34:48.166 --> 00:34:49.667
I didn't think
it was a tough question.

783
00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.900
Didn't like me. I have
to think. let me think.

784
00:34:53.633 --> 00:34:55.200
Well. the truth is
yes. there was one.

785
00:34:55.333 --> 00:34:57.100
but it didn't
work out. so--

786
00:34:57.233 --> 00:34:59.533
Oh. hang on. let me guess.
she wanted to settle down

787
00:34:59.667 --> 00:35:02.700
but you weren't done
being Mr. Danger--

788
00:35:02.834 --> 00:35:04.734
Or. uh. what? Mr. Adventure.

789
00:35:04.867 --> 00:35:07.567
Umm. Yeah. something
like that.

790
00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.233
Hey. you guys ready?
Gonna head out.

791
00:35:09.367 --> 00:35:12.100
Yeah. yeah. we'll be
there in a minute.

792
00:35:12.233 --> 00:35:13.900
I still don't think this is
gonna measure up to zip line.

793
00:35:14.033 --> 00:35:15.066
I'm telling you.

794
00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:18.100
-Really?
-Yeah. really.

795
00:35:18.233 --> 00:35:20.900
Maybe if you stopped going
a hundred miles an hour.

796
00:35:21.033 --> 00:35:24.600
and slowed down.

797
00:35:24.734 --> 00:35:26.567
you might actually get
to see where you're at.

798
00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:28.600
-[birds chirping]
-[gentle music]

799
00:35:30.133 --> 00:35:35.400
-[ship engine revving]
-[gentle music]

800
00:35:44.066 --> 00:35:48.800
You were right. it's beautiful.
I stand corrected.

801
00:36:00.734 --> 00:36:02.233
because this episode
of Next Destination.

802
00:36:02.367 --> 00:36:05.000
is all about the food
here in Hawaii.

803
00:36:05.133 --> 00:36:06.433
From fine dining to food trucks.

804
00:36:06.567 --> 00:36:08.266
to farmers markets
like this one.

805
00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.934
we're gonna sample
the best eats on the islands.

806
00:36:11.066 --> 00:36:13.200
Your taste buds ready
for an adventure pace.

807
00:36:13.333 --> 00:36:16.033
Well. that depends
on how much of an adventure

808
00:36:16.166 --> 00:36:17.734
you're talking about.
Well. I don't know.

809
00:36:17.867 --> 00:36:19.100
There was a booth back
there that had everything

810
00:36:19.233 --> 00:36:21.266
from snails to cow's tongue.

811
00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:26.100
Oh. uh. well. why don't we leave
the cow's tongue to you?

812
00:36:26.233 --> 00:36:28.367
And I can focus on the desserts.

813
00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.000
That hardly seems fair.

814
00:36:30.133 --> 00:36:32.867
You're the one
who wanted an adventure.
Oh!

815
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.667
And... cut!
Great work. you two.

816
00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.200
We're gonna get set up
with the next shot.

817
00:36:37.333 --> 00:36:39.000
-Okay. thanks.
-Sounds good.

818
00:36:39.133 --> 00:36:40.433
There may be hope for us yet?

819
00:36:40.567 --> 00:36:42.166
Yeah. stick with me.
kid-- we'll go far!

820
00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.266
[laughs]

821
00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:49.033
One week into the shoot and
the network is very excited.

822
00:36:49.166 --> 00:36:50.834
I hope not that excited.

823
00:36:50.967 --> 00:36:53.667
'cause I only signed on to do
just the one season. right?

824
00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.066
Of course. of course.

825
00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.867
we can absolutely
replace you next season.

826
00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.266
Okay.

827
00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:59.734
You're not really
looking forward

828
00:36:59.867 --> 00:37:02.800
to getting back
to your desk. are you?

829
00:37:02.934 --> 00:37:06.767
Yes. absolutely. this
is way too much stress.

830
00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:10.333
Oh. come on. you missed
hosting. I can tell.

831
00:37:10.467 --> 00:37:14.433
Maybe a little. I think
I'm just getting distracted

832
00:37:14.567 --> 00:37:16.734
-by the romance of it all.
-Romance?

833
00:37:16.867 --> 00:37:21.333
Okay. no. no. no.
the romance of...

834
00:37:21.467 --> 00:37:23.066
the island.

835
00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:26.333
the beach and
the people and the food.

836
00:37:26.467 --> 00:37:29.967
What did you call--
the Hawaii bubble?

837
00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:32.934
Not a single person
has recognized me
since I've been here.

838
00:37:33.066 --> 00:37:37.800
I told you. I have short
memories. enjoy your bubble.

839
00:37:37.934 --> 00:37:39.734
What happens when it bursts?

840
00:37:39.867 --> 00:37:41.433
Well. I'm just glad

841
00:37:41.567 --> 00:37:42.934
that you and Ben have
buried the hatchet for now.

842
00:37:43.066 --> 00:37:45.066
I don't know
if we've buried the hatchet.

843
00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.834
but at least we're not trying to
kill each other with it anymore.

844
00:37:47.967 --> 00:37:51.900
-[laughs]
-There's that.

845
00:37:52.033 --> 00:37:54.000
Oh. speaking of Ben.

846
00:37:57.066 --> 00:37:58.734
Go. go on.

847
00:37:58.867 --> 00:38:00.834
I'll be fine. I'll be fine.

848
00:38:00.967 --> 00:38:03.367
-Two glasses?
-Yeah. I got it.

849
00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:06.500
Hey. you. Paige. I would
like you to meet Kekoa.

850
00:38:06.633 --> 00:38:08.233
Kekoa. this is Paige.

851
00:38:08.367 --> 00:38:11.066
He was just telling me about
this restaurant called--

852
00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.967
Maluhia. that's right.

853
00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:14.834
They have the best kalua
pork in the islands.

854
00:38:14.967 --> 00:38:16.867
Bake it underground for hours.

855
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.033
He described it
as life-changing.

856
00:38:20.166 --> 00:38:22.800
Only locals go there. best
kept secret type of place.

857
00:38:22.934 --> 00:38:24.233
Exactly.

858
00:38:24.367 --> 00:38:26.033
Well. I do like
the sound of that.

859
00:38:26.166 --> 00:38:28.800
What are you doing for dinner?

860
00:38:28.934 --> 00:38:32.033
What I was just gonna
order some room service.

861
00:38:32.166 --> 00:38:33.734
and do some work.

862
00:38:33.867 --> 00:38:35.367
Change of plans.
We're going out.

863
00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:37.567
-Ben. I can't.
-I'm not saying we send a crew.

864
00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:41.033
I just want you
to go to dinner with me.

865
00:38:41.166 --> 00:38:42.367
Don't tell me you're
not a little bit intrigued.

866
00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:44.066
I saw how you ate today.

867
00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:47.066
-[laughs]
-Okay.

868
00:38:48.133 --> 00:38:49.700
Well.

869
00:38:51.633 --> 00:38:52.533
Okay.

870
00:38:52.667 --> 00:38:54.000
-Yeah?
-All right.

871
00:38:54.133 --> 00:38:55.667
She said yes.
I can't believe it.

872
00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.400
Mahalo. Kekoa. so
where is it again?

873
00:38:57.533 --> 00:38:59.367
Just go straight up Mauka.

874
00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:02.066
make a left by the two coconut
trees and you should be good.

875
00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:04.266
-Okay. Aloha.
-Aloha.

This is life-changing!

878
00:39:17.166 --> 00:39:20.900
-Life-changing.
-[laughs]

879
00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:24.800
What. Oh no.

880
00:39:24.934 --> 00:39:26.367
No. no. no. no. it's not that.

881
00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:30.033
You just... Looks like
you're having fun again.

882
00:39:30.166 --> 00:39:33.467
You gotta be careful.
it's habit-forming.

883
00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:36.033
What. so is this food.

884
00:39:36.166 --> 00:39:38.600
If the network
greenlights my new show.

885
00:39:38.734 --> 00:39:41.867
these are the kind
of places I wanna explore.

886
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.066
Now. that I find interesting.

887
00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.767
What else would
you do on your show?

888
00:39:48.767 --> 00:39:54.033
Okay. so it's a travel show.
that unfolds like a mystery.

889
00:39:54.166 --> 00:39:55.867
We're gonna give them clues

890
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.900
that they have to figure out
kind of like an escape room.

891
00:39:58.033 --> 00:39:59.934
where we're gonna
blindfold them.

892
00:40:00.066 --> 00:40:03.066
All this from a woman
that needs a plan.

893
00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:05.867
Well. I'm gonna know
what's gonna happen.

894
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.700
But it's a host.

895
00:40:07.834 --> 00:40:10.467
[gentle music]

896
00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:24.400
[laughs]

897
00:40:26.333 --> 00:40:28.467
-Well. you were right.
-Yeah?

898
00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:31.600
Yeah. that was good.

899
00:40:31.734 --> 00:40:33.266
What do you think
about adding it

900
00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:35.433
to the off-the-beaten-path
episode at the end?

901
00:40:35.567 --> 00:40:37.233
Hey. that'd be great.

902
00:40:37.367 --> 00:40:38.934
Help it stand out from all
the other restaurants. yeah.

903
00:40:39.066 --> 00:40:41.700
-Exactly. We got a deal?
-We got a deal.

904
00:40:41.834 --> 00:40:44.300
Hey. we've been
looking for you guys.

905
00:40:44.433 --> 00:40:45.934
Oh. we were just
saying good night.

906
00:40:46.066 --> 00:40:47.900
-Ben.
-Yes. goodnight. Paige.

907
00:40:48.033 --> 00:40:49.400
-Ben.
-Paige.

908
00:40:49.533 --> 00:40:51.867
-Ben.
-Why y'all of being weird?

909
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.066
We're not being weird.
you're being weird.

910
00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:55.633
Why are you looking
for us for anyway?

911
00:40:55.767 --> 00:40:57.867
We're gonna go to a concert.
you wanna come?

912
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.934
Concert. yeah that'd be fun.
you wanna go to a concert?

913
00:41:02.066 --> 00:41:04.934
I have some work
still tonight.

914
00:41:05.066 --> 00:41:08.100
-Come on.
-Duty calls.

915
00:41:08.233 --> 00:41:10.700
Okay. you're right.
don't work too late.

916
00:41:10.834 --> 00:41:12.266
[chuckles] Have fun.

917
00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.667
-Okay. bye.

918
00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.800

and restaurants are done.

923

We have a good start
on must-see sites.

924
00:41:41.233 --> 00:41:43.967
And then we move into culture
fun in the sun nightlife.

925
00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:46.367
and off-the-beaten-path.

926
00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:49.633
Where is Ben. I thought
he was joining us.

927
00:41:49.767 --> 00:41:51.133
Well. this is supposed
to be our day off.

928
00:41:51.266 --> 00:41:53.967
so I told him to go
relax by the pool.

929
00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:55.867
Why didn't I get that option?

930
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.800
Because you're not a relaxed
by the pool kind of person.

931
00:41:58.934 --> 00:42:00.500
You're a first one
in the office.

932
00:42:00.633 --> 00:42:02.567
work on schedules on
your day off kind of person.

933
00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:04.266
Well. we're not
in the office. are we?

934
00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:08.266
We are in the Hawaii
bubble. remember?

935
00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:11.500
And you are here with me.
working on schedules.

936
00:42:11.633 --> 00:42:12.600
on your day off.

937
00:42:12.734 --> 00:42:13.834
Yeah. and whose idea was that?

938
00:42:13.967 --> 00:42:16.433
Yours. You called me!

939
00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:23.867
Well. I have changed my mind.

940
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.533
I am going to sit by the pool.
and have a little fun.

941
00:42:30.533 --> 00:42:32.033
Okay. why does
everyone keep acting.

942
00:42:32.166 --> 00:42:35.033
like I don't know
how to have fun?

943
00:42:35.166 --> 00:42:40.200
Oh. is this the part where
you're being more sensitive

944
00:42:40.333 --> 00:42:41.900
to people's feelings?

945
00:42:42.033 --> 00:42:45.433
-Yes.
-Okay.

946
00:42:47.066 --> 00:42:49.100
Is it not working?

947
00:42:54.467 --> 00:42:57.200
[sighs]

948
00:42:57.333 --> 00:43:00.333
I am fun. I am a fun person. hi.

949
00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:04.300
Hey. what's going on?

950
00:43:04.433 --> 00:43:10.133
Ben. hi. yeah. I was
just chilling. you?

951
00:43:10.266 --> 00:43:11.900
Well. I was gonna try
my hand at surfing.

952
00:43:12.033 --> 00:43:13.467
but now I think we should talk

953
00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:15.900
about your use of
the word chillin'.

954
00:43:16.033 --> 00:43:18.000
Well. it's our day off.

955
00:43:18.133 --> 00:43:20.433
so Millie wanted
to go over schedules.

956
00:43:20.567 --> 00:43:25.400
I was like. "No way.
I am going to. uh.

957
00:43:25.533 --> 00:43:27.000
have some fun."

958
00:43:27.133 --> 00:43:31.767
Really. well. Paige
Marshall having fun?

959
00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:33.300
That is something I need to see.

960
00:43:33.433 --> 00:43:36.333
How about if I get us a cabana?

961
00:43:36.467 --> 00:43:40.367
Yeah. sure. sounds chill.

962
00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:43.266
Please stop saying that word.

963
00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:44.967

964
00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:46.700

So how's that chilling
thing working out for you?

969
00:44:07.734 --> 00:44:10.767
Yeah. never felt more relaxed.

970
00:44:13.066 --> 00:44:15.633
Oh. yeah. I can tell.

971
00:44:15.767 --> 00:44:18.967
Face it. you would rather be
doing schedules with Millie.

972
00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:23.900
No way! Okay. I find doing
scheduling very relaxing.

973
00:44:24.033 --> 00:44:25.600
What's wrong with me?

974
00:44:25.734 --> 00:44:27.800
Relaxing and having fun
are like the muscles.

975
00:44:27.934 --> 00:44:30.233
If you don't use them.
they're gonna atrophy.

976
00:44:30.367 --> 00:44:33.700
What are you. like a personal
trainer for goofing off?

977
00:44:33.834 --> 00:44:35.567
Yes. yes I am.

978
00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:37.934
I like the sound of that.
Put that on a business card.

979
00:44:38.066 --> 00:44:39.467
Aren't you glad you hired me?

980
00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:41.133
You're not gonna
get that from Todd.

981
00:44:41.266 --> 00:44:43.567
That's for sure.
He's way too boring.

982
00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:44.767
No. he isn't.

983
00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:47.300
Oh! Yes. he is.

984
00:44:47.433 --> 00:44:50.467
I worked with him for
a year. remember. so boring.

985
00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:52.300
Well. I find him
very interesting.

986
00:44:52.433 --> 00:44:54.100
Name one interesting
conversation

987
00:44:54.233 --> 00:44:56.800
you had with Todd Harper. go.

988
00:44:56.934 --> 00:45:02.333
Oh. well... we talked
about clothes.

989
00:45:02.467 --> 00:45:04.500
He knows a lot about clothes.

990
00:45:04.633 --> 00:45:06.300
He could. yeah.
he can talk forever

991
00:45:06.433 --> 00:45:10.967
about waterproof jackets--
and. uh.

992
00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:12.333
it was fascinating.

993
00:45:12.467 --> 00:45:13.867
I just about fell asleep
listening to you

994
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.700
talk about that conversation.

995
00:45:15.834 --> 00:45:18.133
I can't imagine actually
having that conversation.

996
00:45:18.266 --> 00:45:19.533
Okay. well I'm sorry.

997
00:45:19.667 --> 00:45:22.467
Not everyone can have
a carefree life.

998
00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:25.867
that's all about having fun
and never anything of substance.

999
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.600
Well. that's unfair.

1000
00:45:27.734 --> 00:45:29.533
I do lots of things
of substance.

-Like now. an example?
-Yeah. yes.

1003
00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:38.367
Well. there are a lot
of them. things of substance.

1004
00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:40.934
Oh.
But we're not talking about
me. we're talking about you.

1005
00:45:41.066 --> 00:45:43.200
and your inability
to relax and have fun.

1006
00:45:43.333 --> 00:45:46.633
So. I say let's
exercise those muscles.

there's a chance.

For 100 points.

1042
00:47:04.367 --> 00:47:08.433
What female group
had a 1987 hit.

1043
00:47:08.567 --> 00:47:11.567
with a cover of the
Simon and Garfunkel song.

1044
00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:14.633
A Hazy Shade of Winter.

1045
00:47:14.767 --> 00:47:16.500
Bangles. The Bangles.

1047

Sorry about that.

1053
00:47:33.734 --> 00:47:35.734
[laughs]

1054
00:47:35.867 --> 00:47:37.300
Give it up for the winners.

1055
00:47:37.433 --> 00:47:40.500
What are your names.
Ben. and this is Paige.

1056
00:47:40.633 --> 00:47:44.000
Oh. wait a second.
I thought I recognized you.

1057
00:47:44.133 --> 00:47:45.567
Ladies and gentlemen.

1058
00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:48.066
we have an honest
to goodness celebrity.

1059
00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:50.166
right here in our midst.

1060
00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:53.633
It's the goat lady.
[bleats]

1061
00:47:53.767 --> 00:47:56.033
[laughs]

1062
00:48:00.133 --> 00:48:02.066
[indistinct]

1063
00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:05.066
[waves crashing]

1064
00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:07.900
[gentle music]

1065
00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:17.967
Hey there. you left without.

1066
00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:20.500
your half the world's
greatest trophy.

1067
00:48:20.633 --> 00:48:22.500
I was thinking
we could split it.

1068
00:48:22.633 --> 00:48:24.066
Which part would you like?

1069
00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:27.166
Oh. that's okay.
you can keep both halves.

1070
00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:28.400
All right.

1071
00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:34.333
[gentle music]

1072
00:48:34.467 --> 00:48:36.800
You know. the goats
were my idea.

1073
00:48:36.934 --> 00:48:38.500
We weren't planning it.

1074
00:48:38.633 --> 00:48:42.667
We were on our way to
a location. and I saw this farm.

1075
00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:44.567
and I thought.
"Hey. that would be fun.

1076
00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:46.300
No script. no rehearsal.
no planning.

1077
00:48:46.433 --> 00:48:48.700
just walk out into
the middle of the field.

1078
00:48:48.834 --> 00:48:50.900
and start filming it."

1079
00:48:51.033 --> 00:48:53.066
I didn't realize someone
else was filming it

1080
00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:54.734
on their cell phone.

1081
00:48:54.867 --> 00:48:57.700
Yap. that would definitely
be embarrassing.

1082
00:48:57.834 --> 00:49:02.000
Oh. it was more
than just embarrassing.

1083
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.133
I left the gate open.
when I ran away.

1084
00:49:06.266 --> 00:49:07.700
and the goats got out.
they ate everything.

1085
00:49:07.834 --> 00:49:09.300
We got sued.

1086
00:49:09.433 --> 00:49:11.700
because of course we didn't
have filming permits.

1087
00:49:11.834 --> 00:49:13.700
So I was a joke. fine.

1088
00:49:13.834 --> 00:49:18.734
But people lost their jobs
because of me.

1089
00:49:19.867 --> 00:49:21.233
I can't help but think

1090
00:49:21.367 --> 00:49:25.767
if we had just stuck
to the plan. maybe...

1091
00:49:28.233 --> 00:49:30.266
Yeah.

1092
00:49:34.333 --> 00:49:36.133
You wanna know why
I left Next Destination.

1093
00:49:36.266 --> 00:49:38.233
to start my own show?

1094
00:49:38.367 --> 00:49:41.333
Oh. creative differences?

1095
00:49:45.567 --> 00:49:48.166
Yeah. yeah.
something like that.

1096
00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:54.700
Tell you what. why don't
we just wipe the slate clean?

1097
00:49:54.834 --> 00:49:56.834
-[soft music]
-[waves crashing]

1098
00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:07.934
here i.

1099
00:50:08.066 --> 00:50:10.033
For instance. the luau.

1100
00:50:10.166 --> 00:50:13.900
Did you know. that in ancient
days. it was called. aha'aina.

1101
00:50:14.033 --> 00:50:19.133
Aha meaning gathering. and aina
meaning eating many things.

1102
00:50:19.266 --> 00:50:20.734
That was correct.

1103
00:50:20.867 --> 00:50:23.800
[gentle music]

1104
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.200
I can do that.

1105
00:50:27.333 --> 00:50:28.767
[laughs]
No you couldn't.

1106
00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:31.100
No. I could not.
[laughs]

1107
00:50:31.233 --> 00:50:33.467
And cut. thank you everyone.

1108
00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:35.367
Okay. everyone remember

1109
00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:36.767
that we're gonna come back
here tonight for some B-roll

1110
00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:39.233
of the luau and festivities
and everything.

1111
00:50:39.367 --> 00:50:42.066
So. I think that
went pretty well.

1112
00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:45.100
-You did a little research.
-A little bit.

1113
00:50:45.233 --> 00:50:46.533
[laughs] I'm impressed.

1114
00:50:46.667 --> 00:50:49.100
And for the record.
I could totally do that.

1115
00:50:49.233 --> 00:50:50.233
No. you couldn't.

1116
00:50:50.367 --> 00:50:52.800
-No. I could not.
-[laughs]

1117
00:50:52.934 --> 00:50:55.934
-I'll see you.
-All right. bye-bye.

1118
00:50:56.066 --> 00:50:58.367
What are you smiling about?

1119
00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:00.066
I'm not smiling.

1120
00:51:04.233 --> 00:51:06.834
Is this about Paige?

1121
00:51:06.967 --> 00:51:08.200
I saw you smiling again.

1122
00:51:08.333 --> 00:51:09.867
Its my job. I'm on TV.

1123
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.333
Oh come on. Ben. you like her.

1124
00:51:11.467 --> 00:51:14.033
No. I don't.

1125
00:51:14.166 --> 00:51:16.667
Okay. yeah. I do.
but not that way.

1126
00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:19.333
She just. something
happened yesterday

1127
00:51:19.467 --> 00:51:20.433
and she was upset. that's all.

1128
00:51:20.567 --> 00:51:22.133
Oh. what'd you do?

1129
00:51:22.266 --> 00:51:25.834
I didn't do anything.
she's not mad at me.

1130
00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:30.533
She told me some personal
stuff and it got kinda serious.

1131
00:51:30.667 --> 00:51:32.800
So I was smiling.
because she was smiling.

1132
00:51:32.934 --> 00:51:34.300
And I thought maybe she got over

1133
00:51:34.433 --> 00:51:37.667
what happened
yesterday. that's all.

1134
00:51:43.333 --> 00:51:46.100
Did you ask her
if she was really over it?

1135
00:51:46.233 --> 00:51:49.133
[gentle music]

1136
00:51:50.967 --> 00:51:52.767

wrong with my dress?

No. you look amazing.

1141

Oh. well. thank you.

1142

Oh. Suddenly Mr. Adventure
is not feeling so adventurous.

1165

00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:31.867
That's it. aren't
they doing great?

1196
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:32.967
Yes.

1197
00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:37.900
-[drums beating]
-[clapping]

1198
00:55:40.934 --> 00:55:42.233
Don't tell me
you're not impressed.

1199
00:55:42.367 --> 00:55:43.967
[laughs]

1200
00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:45.967
You know. if Next Destination
doesn't work out.

1201
00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:47.533
I think we got
a shot as dancers.

1202
00:55:47.667 --> 00:55:49.066
Oh no. no. no.

1203
00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:50.734
That was the beginning

1204
00:55:50.867 --> 00:55:53.600
and the end of
my Tahitian dance career.

1205
00:55:53.734 --> 00:55:55.200
[laughs]

1206
00:55:55.333 --> 00:55:58.767
Oh. poof. I'm just glad
no one recognized me.

1207
00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:04.600
Yeah. actually I wanted
to talk to you about that.

1208
00:56:04.734 --> 00:56:05.767
You know. when you were talking

1209
00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:08.233
the other night. about the...

1210
00:56:09.767 --> 00:56:11.266
My crushing embarrassment?

1211
00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:12.767
Yeah. thanks for bringing it up.

1212
00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:14.433
Yeah. that.

1213
00:56:14.567 --> 00:56:17.133
Well. I wasn't exactly
straight with you.

1214
00:56:17.266 --> 00:56:19.700
The real reason I left
Next Destination

1215
00:56:19.834 --> 00:56:23.467
was not because of
creative differences.

1216
00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:25.934
Remember the girl
that I told you about?

1217
00:56:26.066 --> 00:56:27.467
Yeah.

1218
00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:30.600
Well. it was actually
pretty serious.

1219
00:56:30.734 --> 00:56:32.467
I thought she was the one.

1220
00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:34.834
So I had it all planned
out-- the big house.

1221
00:56:34.967 --> 00:56:37.700
white picket fence.
three kids. two dogs.

1222
00:56:37.834 --> 00:56:41.533
Luis in the guest room
above the garage.

1223
00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:46.934
Well. what happened?

1224
00:56:47.066 --> 00:56:48.700
Well...

1225
00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:51.600
I was all in.

1226
00:56:51.734 --> 00:56:53.967
and. uh. she wasn't.

1227
00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:56.433
I'm sorry.

1228
00:56:56.567 --> 00:56:59.100
You know. I figured

1229
00:56:59.233 --> 00:57:01.567
what good's a plan
if you can't make it real?

1230
00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:05.667
So. after that. following
a script. it just. uh...

1231
00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:07.400
I couldn't do it.
so I quit.

1232
00:57:07.533 --> 00:57:10.934
And I've just been operating
without a manual ever since.

1233
00:57:11.066 --> 00:57:14.066
Take it as it comes
and just see what happens.

1234
00:57:15.166 --> 00:57:17.033
Seems to have worked for you.

1235
00:57:17.166 --> 00:57:18.667
Yeah. but I think

1236
00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:20.100
that I'm realizing

1237
00:57:20.233 --> 00:57:23.900
since I've been here.
with you.

1238
00:57:24.033 --> 00:57:28.567
that. uh. maybe I
really do want something...

1239
00:57:30.467 --> 00:57:32.900
with a little bit
more substance.

1240
00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:36.734
You know?

1241
00:57:38.333 --> 00:57:41.867
-Uh...
-[gentle music]

1242
00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:44.834
The Hawaii bubble.
it just...

1243
00:57:44.967 --> 00:57:46.033
The... the what?

1244
00:57:46.166 --> 00:57:47.066
It's...

1245
00:57:48.233 --> 00:57:49.767
this place.

1246
00:57:52.133 --> 00:57:53.834
What happens when we leave

1247
00:57:53.967 --> 00:57:55.600
and I go back to New York

1248
00:57:55.734 --> 00:57:59.633
and you go to wherever it is
you're gonna go next?

1249
00:58:02.433 --> 00:58:04.533
What happens when
the bubble bursts?

1250
00:58:08.967 --> 00:58:10.967
I...

1251
00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:14.600
I should go to sleep.
We've got an hour to start.

1252
00:58:14.734 --> 00:58:15.700
Yeah.

1253
00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:18.166
Goodnight. Ben.

1254
00:58:19.467 --> 00:58:20.667
Goodnight.

1255
00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:29.200
[sighs. chuckles]

1256
00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:37.867
exploring the trails
in this magnificent valley.

1257
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.834
That's right. it's a super
fun place for ATV-ing.

1258
00:58:41.967 --> 00:58:43.133
That it is. Paige.

1259
00:58:43.266 --> 00:58:45.500
however. today
we were UTV-ing.

1260
00:58:47.166 --> 00:58:49.066
-What? No.
-Yeah.

1261
00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:50.367
What's the difference?

1262
00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:52.900
Well a UTV is
a utility task vehicle

1263
00:58:53.033 --> 00:58:55.200
and an ATV is
an all-terrain vehicle.

1264
00:58:55.333 --> 00:58:58.133
which has a handlebar and
drives much like a motorcycle.

1265
00:58:58.266 --> 00:59:01.266
[imitates motor vehicle]

1266
00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:03.467
So you just considered
the whole growing-up thing

1267
00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:06.266
to be optional?
[laughs]

1268
00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:08.467
And we'll be right back
with more recreation

1269
00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:11.367
and sporting activities.
including golf. hiking.

1270
00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:12.967
and making fun
of your co-host.

1271
00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:14.967
-[laughs]
-Cut.

1272
00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:17.200
Okay. thank you. everybody.
We're moving on.

1273
00:59:17.333 --> 00:59:19.233
That's lunch. meet back
at the resort at noon.

1274
00:59:19.367 --> 00:59:20.800
All right. sounds good.
Thanks. Luis.

1275
00:59:20.934 --> 00:59:22.400
So. it sounds like we've
got a couple of hours.

1276
00:59:22.533 --> 00:59:24.734
so I think I'll head
back and check on Millie.

1277
00:59:24.867 --> 00:59:27.400
see how the cut of
the last episode's coming.

1278
00:59:27.533 --> 00:59:29.400
Okay. all right.
sounds good.

1279
00:59:29.533 --> 00:59:31.033
I'll see you there.

1280
00:59:31.166 --> 00:59:34.233
I think I'm gonna do
a little bit more a UTV-ing.

1281
00:59:34.367 --> 00:59:35.934
You wanna join me?

1282
00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:38.900
I should probably...

1283
00:59:39.033 --> 00:59:40.467
What. check on Millie?

1284
00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:42.300
Yes. exactly.

1285
00:59:42.433 --> 00:59:43.767
Who's gonna
have what reaction?

1286
00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:45.400
When you stand
over her shoulder

1287
00:59:45.533 --> 00:59:48.934
as she tries that
at the last episode?

1288
00:59:49.066 --> 00:59:51.900
-UTV. you say?
-[car door opens]

1289
00:59:52.033 --> 00:59:53.367
Please.

1290
00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:55.633
[upbeat music playing]

1291
00:59:57.400 --> 01:00:00.667
[car engine roaring]

1292
01:00:13.767 --> 01:00:16.100
[Ben]
Yee-haw!

1293
01:00:17.667 --> 01:00:20.133
[laughs] That was super fun.

1294
01:00:20.266 --> 01:00:22.233
What is your place like
in L.A.?

1295
01:00:24.233 --> 01:00:26.266
-Its pretty basic.
-Oh.

1296
01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:29.567
Yeah. I'm not there
very much. so it's
no big deal. but. uh...

1297
01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:33.066
what's your place
in New York like?

1298
01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:37.367
It's cute. it's cozy.
it's small. but... I like it.

1299
01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:40.200
What if you're
not there as much.

1300
01:00:40.333 --> 01:00:42.100
if they ask us to
do another season?

1301
01:00:42.233 --> 01:00:43.433
Oh. they only want me
for one.

1302
01:00:43.567 --> 01:00:47.500
Yeah. I know.
but what do you want?

1303
01:00:49.734 --> 01:00:50.867
What do you mean?

1304
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.100
Well. look. I realized

1305
01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:55.567
that we had our
ups and downs. we did.

1306
01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:57.734
But... I don't know.

1307
01:00:57.867 --> 01:00:59.867
I think it's really
starting to click now.

1308
01:01:00.066 --> 01:01:04.467
I like who I am when
I'm with you. on camera.

1309
01:01:06.066 --> 01:01:08.667
I think that we should
take the bubble with us.

1310
01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:13.000
I think we should do
another season together.

1311
01:01:13.133 --> 01:01:14.200
Are you serious?

1312
01:01:14.333 --> 01:01:17.433
Come on.
we're a great team.

1313
01:01:17.567 --> 01:01:19.800
You know it. and I know it.

1314
01:01:19.934 --> 01:01:23.200
So... is this
something that you.

1315
01:01:23.333 --> 01:01:25.333
you know. would consider?

1316
01:01:27.967 --> 01:01:29.166
I don't know.

1317
01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:31.300
Paige. you've
gotta ask yourself.

1318
01:01:31.433 --> 01:01:33.300
Would you rather
sit in a dark room.

1319
01:01:33.433 --> 01:01:36.367
watching videos of
sunsets and snorkeling.

1320
01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:39.033
or would you rather
do those things...

1321
01:01:39.166 --> 01:01:40.900
with me?

1322
01:01:43.967 --> 01:01:45.567
Are we still talking
about the show?

1323
01:01:49.433 --> 01:01:51.033
I don't know.

1324
01:01:53.066 --> 01:01:55.700
I don't know
what we're gonna find
if we go down that path.

1325
01:01:55.834 --> 01:01:58.367
Ben. it's not even up to us.

1326
01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:01.367
We'd have to get Millie
to buy in and the network.

1327
01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.533
I know.
I agree. but I think
that we should

1328
01:02:03.667 --> 01:02:05.967
at least let them know
what we want. right?

1329
01:02:10.567 --> 01:02:14.633
Okay. let me talk to
Millie about it first.

1330
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.433
Okay. got it.

1331
01:02:18.567 --> 01:02:20.400
Then maybe tomorrow
night we'll get together.

1332
01:02:20.533 --> 01:02:21.934
and we could strategize.

1333
01:02:22.066 --> 01:02:23.667
-Strategize?
-Yeah.

1334
01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:25.934
This is sounding
suspiciously like a plan.

1335
01:02:26.066 --> 01:02:27.934
-Hmm?
-Nnnnn.

1336
01:02:28.066 --> 01:02:32.066
-Okay. a little bit.
-[Paige laughs]

1337
01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:35.500
[indistinct chatter]

1338
01:02:35.633 --> 01:02:37.300
[dramatic music]

1339
01:02:42.533 --> 01:02:43.934
Okay. what is
wrong with you?

1340
01:02:44.066 --> 01:02:48.233
What? Nothing.
What? Why?

1341
01:02:48.367 --> 01:02:50.233
You look odd.

1342
01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:55.333
Okay. um...

1343
01:02:55.467 --> 01:02:57.200
I did wanna
ask you a question.

1344
01:02:57.333 --> 01:02:58.734
Okay. go ahead.

1345
01:02:58.867 --> 01:03:01.233
Yeah. oh... uh...

1346
01:03:01.367 --> 01:03:06.233
so. Ben asked me.

1347
01:03:06.367 --> 01:03:11.767
if I would consider thinking
about maybe possibly...

1348
01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:13.100
uh...

1349
01:03:14.934 --> 01:03:18.934
continuing on to host
the show next season.

1350
01:03:20.433 --> 01:03:21.667
[chuckles]

1351
01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:23.800
Wow. that-- that is big.

1352
01:03:23.934 --> 01:03:26.667
Couple weeks ago. that was
the last item on your list

1353
01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:30.066
of things that you
would consider thinking
about maybe possibly doing.

1354
01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:31.734
I've had a change of heart.

1355
01:03:31.867 --> 01:03:33.600
Is this about your heart?

1356
01:03:33.734 --> 01:03:35.934
No. not... not really.

1357
01:03:36.066 --> 01:03:38.066
I mean. maybe a little.

1358
01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:42.834
This is mostly about
me remembering

1359
01:03:42.967 --> 01:03:46.100
how much I enjoy
doing this job.

1360
01:03:46.233 --> 01:03:49.600
Hosting. seeing the world.

1361
01:03:49.734 --> 01:03:51.467
having fun.

1362
01:03:53.433 --> 01:03:54.367
I missed it.

1363
01:03:56.066 --> 01:03:58.433
Well...

1364
01:03:58.567 --> 01:04:00.166
I've been working with
the network to make a list

1365
01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:02.500
of possible cohosts
for Ben next season.

1366
01:04:02.633 --> 01:04:04.934
So add me to the list.

1367
01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:08.700
Look. the network is
happy with the footage

1368
01:04:08.834 --> 01:04:11.300
I've been sending them.
but I made it very clear

1369
01:04:11.433 --> 01:04:12.900
that you're only gonna
be on for one season.

1370
01:04:13.033 --> 01:04:14.367
and if I go back now...

1371
01:04:16.166 --> 01:04:17.967
Are you sure
this is what you want?

1372
01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:19.500
It's totally not like you.

1373
01:04:19.633 --> 01:04:21.867
[laughs] I-I know.

1374
01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:28.433
For the first time in.
well. a long time...

1375
01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:33.600
I have no idea what's
gonna happen next.

1376
01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:39.000
[soft laughter]

1377
01:04:39.133 --> 01:04:42.166
[Ben] There was a booth
back there that had everything

1378
01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:44.066
from snails to cow tongue.

1379
01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:46.734
Why don't we leave
the cow's tongue to you.

1380
01:04:46.867 --> 01:04:49.400
and I can focus
on the desserts?

1381
01:04:50.633 --> 01:04:53.500
Mike. hey. it's Todd Harper.

1382
01:04:53.633 --> 01:04:55.700
Yes. I got the video
footage you sent.

1383
01:04:55.834 --> 01:04:58.200
Pretty sneaky of the network
to send me footage

1384
01:04:58.333 --> 01:05:00.467
of the people
you replaced me with.

1385
01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:04.600
[laughs]
Yes. very interesting.

1386
01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:07.400
I think we should talk
about my contract again...

1387
01:05:07.533 --> 01:05:09.600
and about Paige Marshall.

1388
01:05:09.734 --> 01:05:11.467
You're the one who
wanted an adventure.

1389
01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:18.467
s

1390
01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.300
at the club
in a couple of hours.

1391
01:05:20.433 --> 01:05:23.333
and then two days to finish our
"Off the Beaten Path" episode.

1392
01:05:23.467 --> 01:05:24.967
and then we are done.

1393
01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:27.367
What are we doing
tomorrow night again?

1394
01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:29.800
'Cause I was talking to
the bartender. and apparently.

1395
01:05:29.934 --> 01:05:32.600
they're supposed
to be this amazing meteor
shower tomorrow night.

1396
01:05:32.734 --> 01:05:35.867
So the stargazing
should be incredible.

1397
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.100
Wow. unfortunately.
the schedule is locked.

1398
01:05:39.233 --> 01:05:41.367
I agree with Ben.

1399
01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:44.000
I think we should try and
include it. it sounds amazing.

1400
01:05:44.133 --> 01:05:46.467
-Really?
-Yeah.

1401
01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:49.500
Well. then. I will see
what I can do.

1402
01:05:49.633 --> 01:05:52.233
Yes. Thank you.

1403
01:05:54.433 --> 01:05:56.300
Where's everybody going?

1404
01:05:56.433 --> 01:05:59.033
Oh. it's the firework
show on the beach.
Happens every week.

1405
01:05:59.166 --> 01:06:00.767
[Paige] Yes. I've
always missed it.

1406
01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:03.166
Hmm.
Well. then we should go.

1407
01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:06.333
Uh. we still have a couple
of things to talk about.

1408
01:06:06.467 --> 01:06:11.166
Yeah. I know. but
we won't be here when they
do it again next week. so...

1409
01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:14.233
That's okay. I'm sure I
can find a video of it.

1410
01:06:14.367 --> 01:06:18.033
And that's almost as good
as seeing it in person. right?

1411
01:06:18.166 --> 01:06:21.233
-[upbeat music]
-[laughs]

1412
01:06:21.367 --> 01:06:23.033
I'm kidding. Let's go.

1413
01:06:23.166 --> 01:06:25.600
Very funny.
See you guys.

1414
01:06:25.734 --> 01:06:27.233
Good meeting.

1415
01:06:27.367 --> 01:06:29.934
So if they agree to
keep us on permanently--

1416
01:06:30.066 --> 01:06:32.700
When they agree.

1417
01:06:32.834 --> 01:06:34.834
Have you thought about
where you'd like to go?

1418
01:06:34.967 --> 01:06:36.934
I mean. next season
is already set for Morocco.

1419
01:06:37.066 --> 01:06:41.600
but beyond that. the world
is our proverbial oyster.

1420
01:06:41.734 --> 01:06:43.500
I have no idea.

1421
01:06:43.633 --> 01:06:48.066
Truth is. I've never been
very good. planning ahead.

1422
01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:50.233
Okay. I can do
the planning for us both.

1423
01:06:50.367 --> 01:06:52.033
Good.

1424
01:06:52.166 --> 01:06:55.400
I can't wait to see Marrakesh.
Have you been?

1425
01:06:55.533 --> 01:06:58.667
No. but I would love
to go anywhere in Morocco.

1426
01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:00.500
Especially Casablanca.

1427
01:07:00.633 --> 01:07:02.166
I've seen that movie.
like. 200 times.

1428
01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:03.934
My favorite movie
of all time.

1429
01:07:04.066 --> 01:07:06.300
Me too. That's what made
me think of picking it

1430
01:07:06.433 --> 01:07:07.734
as the next destination.

1431
01:07:07.867 --> 01:07:09.066
-Really?
-Yeah.

1432
01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:11.800
Huh. What do you know?

1433
01:07:13.533 --> 01:07:15.767
Thank you.

1434
01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:16.834
For what?

1435
01:07:16.967 --> 01:07:18.433
For...

1436
01:07:21.266 --> 01:07:23.667
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you.

1437
01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:27.967
Look. I realize I'm
supposed to be the expert

1438
01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:30.667
on loud things in motion.
but I'm pretty sure

1439
01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:32.500
you would've found
the fireworks even
without me.

1440
01:07:32.633 --> 01:07:35.066
-Not this.
-What?

1441
01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:37.433
I mean...

1442
01:07:37.567 --> 01:07:39.133
hosting
the show. Hawaii.

1443
01:07:39.266 --> 01:07:41.767
Okay. this might be
the bubble talking.

1444
01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:45.633
but... I feel different
since I've been here.

1445
01:07:45.767 --> 01:07:47.567
And a lot of that
has to do with you.

1446
01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:50.567
You're pretty good
at making people

1447
01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:52.800
step outside
their comfort zone.

1448
01:07:52.934 --> 01:07:56.166
-Thank you.
-[laughs]

1449
01:07:58.233 --> 01:08:00.333
[fireworks explode]

1450
01:08:00.467 --> 01:08:01.367
[Ben] Wow.

1451
01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:33.700
Hello. Millie?

1452
01:08:33.834 --> 01:08:35.333
I got your message--

1453
01:08:35.467 --> 01:08:36.300
Todd.

1454
01:08:36.433 --> 01:08:37.367
Hello. Paige.

1455
01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:38.800
What are you doing here?

1456
01:08:38.934 --> 01:08:40.900
Well. it's...
good to see you too.

1457
01:08:41.033 --> 01:08:42.867
[chuckles]
Sorry. I didn't mean--

1458
01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.367
I just. uh... but
what are you doing here?

1459
01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:48.800
Well. it looks like I
didn't have to put together

1460
01:08:48.934 --> 01:08:51.233
a list of hosts for
next season after all.

1461
01:08:51.367 --> 01:08:53.867
You're coming
back to the show?

1462
01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.033
Well. we still have
a few "I's" to dot
and "T's" to cross.

1463
01:08:56.166 --> 01:08:57.867
but it's looking good.

1464
01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.700
I just wanna come down here
and meet with you both

1465
01:08:59.834 --> 01:09:01.600
and make sure we can all be
on the same page about this.

1466
01:09:01.734 --> 01:09:04.600
And if I happen to get a little
sun in the process. well...

1467
01:09:04.734 --> 01:09:07.300
How... [clears throat]
How did this happen?

1468
01:09:07.433 --> 01:09:09.433
I-I thought your contract--

1469
01:09:09.567 --> 01:09:11.467
You know how
negotiations can be.

1470
01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:14.200
Look. I thought it was over.
and I was okay with that.

1471
01:09:14.333 --> 01:09:16.633
I mean. let's be honest.
it had gotten a bit stale.

1472
01:09:16.767 --> 01:09:18.567
Stale?

1473
01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:20.266
But then the network sent
me footage of you and Ben.

1474
01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:22.233
and it made me realize
what was possible.

1475
01:09:22.367 --> 01:09:25.700
[stammering]
I don't understand.

1476
01:09:25.834 --> 01:09:27.300
You made it fun again.

1477
01:09:27.433 --> 01:09:29.533
The banter.
The back and forth.

1478
01:09:29.667 --> 01:09:31.100
I mean. who would
have imagined that

1479
01:09:31.233 --> 01:09:32.967
that quiet producer
who stayed in New York

1480
01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:35.133
while we were out doing all
the fun stuff had that in her?

1481
01:09:35.266 --> 01:09:37.033
Well. I think we're
gonna have that same kind

1482
01:09:37.166 --> 01:09:39.033
of chemistry too.

1483
01:09:39.166 --> 01:09:43.033
Mmm. wait-- you want me
to co-host with you?

1484
01:09:43.166 --> 01:09:45.100
Yes.

1485
01:09:45.233 --> 01:09:48.033
And I told the network it's
the only way I'd come back.

1486
01:09:48.166 --> 01:09:51.200
Uh...
what about Ben?

1487
01:09:51.333 --> 01:09:55.100
I'm sure he'll
land on his feet.
He's done it before.

1488
01:09:56.567 --> 01:09:58.166
Right.

1489
01:10:00.266 --> 01:10:03.233
Uh. if you just can
excuse me. please.

1490
01:10:08.333 --> 01:10:10.066
[Millie]
Paige! Paige. wait!

1491
01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.867
Did you know about this?

1492
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.934
I knew that
they were talking.

1493
01:10:14.066 --> 01:10:15.867
but I didn't know what
had gotten this far

1494
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.900
until he showed up
at my door an hour ago.

1495
01:10:18.033 --> 01:10:20.133
They can't just fire Ben.

1496
01:10:20.266 --> 01:10:21.967
It's a one-season deal.

1497
01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:24.767
It was always up to them
if there was gonna
be a season two.

1498
01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:27.567
I thought they liked
what Ben and I were doing.

1499
01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:31.233
They did. but Ben has
left this show once before.

1500
01:10:31.367 --> 01:10:33.033
and they were afraid
he might do it again.

1501
01:10:33.166 --> 01:10:34.767
And they know that
the viewers love Todd.

1502
01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:36.967
Then why keep me?
Why not just...

1503
01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:39.133
Fine. give the show
back to Todd.

1504
01:10:39.266 --> 01:10:41.533
Because he wants you.

1505
01:10:41.667 --> 01:10:43.967
And the network likes the
dynamic of having two hosts.

1506
01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:45.800
They think it works.

1507
01:10:45.934 --> 01:10:49.233
Yeah. it works because Ben
and I made it work. together.

1508
01:10:49.367 --> 01:10:53.033
Look. Millie. I didn't
even wanna do this
in the first place.

1509
01:10:53.166 --> 01:10:55.400
and I certainly don't wanna
do it now without Ben.

1510
01:10:55.533 --> 01:10:57.900
Well. Todd doesn't
wanna do it without you.

1511
01:10:58.033 --> 01:11:01.467
He will not sign the contract
unless you agree to co-host.

1512
01:11:02.834 --> 01:11:04.467
Now look at it this way:

1513
01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:06.467
You are in
the driver's seat now.

1514
01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:09.433
You can use this to
get them to agree

1515
01:11:09.567 --> 01:11:11.266
to pick up the show
you pitch them.

1516
01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:12.400
What if I say no?

1517
01:11:16.133 --> 01:11:18.400
You know. I just--
I need to find Ben.

1518
01:11:26.934 --> 01:11:30.000
-Hey. Ben.
-Todd.

1519
01:11:30.133 --> 01:11:32.100
It's good to see you again.
it's been a long time.

1520
01:11:32.233 --> 01:11:34.533
Yeah. wh-what are you
doing here?

1521
01:11:34.667 --> 01:11:36.367
You know. I'm a big
fan of Bold World.

1522
01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.767
Sure. I appreciate that.
thanks.

1523
01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:42.000
I love how you brought
the spirit of your show
to Next Destination.

1524
01:11:42.133 --> 01:11:44.667
We're going to try
and keep as much of that
as possible moving forward.

1525
01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:46.800
Moving forward?

1526
01:11:46.934 --> 01:11:48.500
I must say I'm really looking
forward to coming back

1527
01:11:48.633 --> 01:11:49.967
and co-hosting with Paige.

1528
01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:51.600
I hope that we're
able to recreate

1529
01:11:51.734 --> 01:11:53.667
what you two were able to do.

1530
01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:55.967
I'm sorry. you and Paige...

1531
01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:57.967
are gonna be hosting
Next Destination?

1532
01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:00.367
I know. I'm more
surprised than anyone.

1533
01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:03.400
I think most people have
forgotten about that
whole goat thing.

1534
01:12:03.533 --> 01:12:04.867
Anyways. we'll look
great together.

1535
01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Yeah. yeah.
I'm sure you will.

1536
01:12:08.133 --> 01:12:09.734
So. no hard feelings
of course. I hope.

1537
01:12:09.867 --> 01:12:11.867
No. no. not at all.

1538
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.433
Actually. there she is.

1539
01:12:13.567 --> 01:12:15.734
There she is!

1540
01:12:15.867 --> 01:12:18.000
Well. I'll get out of
your way so you two can
prep for the shoot.

1541
01:12:18.133 --> 01:12:20.000
And it's so nice
seeing you again.

1542
01:12:20.133 --> 01:12:24.433
Paige. let's all go out
and grab dinner and catch up.

1543
01:12:24.567 --> 01:12:26.000
Did you...

1544
01:12:26.133 --> 01:12:27.300
did you know about that?

1545
01:12:29.233 --> 01:12:31.867
Ben. I didn't want you
to find out like this.

1546
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.367
Wow.

1547
01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:38.834
Well. I guess. uh...
I guess it is what it is.

1548
01:12:38.967 --> 01:12:40.867
I mean. it's probably
for the best. right?

1549
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.734
No. No. it isn't.
Ben. you and me. we worked.

1550
01:12:44.867 --> 01:12:47.100
Yeah. I know. but
it's like you said--

1551
01:12:47.233 --> 01:12:48.734
it's the Hawaii bubble.

1552
01:12:48.867 --> 01:12:50.266
And it was bound to
burst at some point.

1553
01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.000
and I guess...
I guess it just did.

1554
01:12:52.133 --> 01:12:53.500
That's not--

1555
01:12:53.633 --> 01:12:55.433
And the truth
about it is that.

1556
01:12:55.567 --> 01:12:58.367
there is a great big
bold world out there
for me to explore.

1557
01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:00.900
so that's...
that's what I'm gonna do.

1558
01:13:01.033 --> 01:13:03.600
You know what? I-I need to
get ready for the segment.

1559
01:13:03.734 --> 01:13:06.500
So do you. so...
I'm gonna go do that.

1560
01:13:06.633 --> 01:13:09.066
and I'll meet you
back here. okay?
But it's okay.

1561
01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:11.100
-No.
-No. it really is. it's fine.

1562
01:13:11.233 --> 01:13:14.300
-I'm fine. I really am.
-Ben. wait.

1563
01:13:36.834 --> 01:13:38.467
Ben. can we talk?

1564
01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:41.367
Oh. hey. yeah.. actually I
wanted to talk to you too.

1565
01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:44.200
You never did change
the lines in the script.

1566
01:13:44.333 --> 01:13:45.700
You know. the last episode
where you say.

1567
01:13:45.834 --> 01:13:47.600
"Thank you for visiting
Hawaii with us."

1568
01:13:47.734 --> 01:13:50.100
and I say. "We'll see you
at our next destination."

1569
01:13:50.233 --> 01:13:53.333
only. obviously.
we won't be seeing anybody.

1570
01:13:53.467 --> 01:13:55.967
It'll be you and Todd.
So. I think we should
definitely change this.

1571
01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:58.767
Look. Ben. please.
I've been trying to get
five minutes with you.

1572
01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:00.500
Can we talk after?

1573
01:14:00.633 --> 01:14:01.900
No. actually.
right away after.
Luis and I are going

1574
01:14:02.033 --> 01:14:03.266
straight to the airport.

1575
01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:05.900
-We're gonna go to Australia.
-What?

1576
01:14:06.033 --> 01:14:07.667
Yeah. never been.
It should be fun.

1577
01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:09.500
Okay. let's get this
show on the road.

1578
01:14:09.633 --> 01:14:13.233
Todd. you're
coming with us?

1579
01:14:14.967 --> 01:14:16.333
Dressed like that?

1580
01:14:16.467 --> 01:14:18.000
Paige. you should
know by now

1581
01:14:18.133 --> 01:14:20.200
to leave the wardrobe
decisions to me.

1582
01:14:20.333 --> 01:14:22.100
Don't worry. you look fine.

1583
01:14:22.233 --> 01:14:23.533
You always did know best.

1584
01:14:25.133 --> 01:14:26.367
Ben.

1585
01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:32.967
You look great.

1586
01:14:38.467 --> 01:14:41.266
[Ben sighs]

1587
01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:43.500
I thought we were
going to be at the beach.

1588
01:14:43.633 --> 01:14:45.166
Millie. you said water.

1589
01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:46.700
Water fall.

1590
01:14:48.333 --> 01:14:50.266
This better be worth it.

1591
01:14:54.133 --> 01:14:56.967
[water rippling]

1592
01:15:01.967 --> 01:15:04.066
-Are you ready?
-Uh...

1593
01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.667
we were gonna change
some of the lines up.

1594
01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:07.667
We can just wing it.

1595
01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:10.900
Really. just wing it?

1596
01:15:11.033 --> 01:15:13.834
Okay. we're gonna wing it.
We're ready anytime you are.

1597
01:15:13.967 --> 01:15:16.433
[Luis] Okay.
everyone. final segment.

1598
01:15:16.567 --> 01:15:18.567
Here we go. and action.

1599
01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:20.233
Welcome to Waimea Valley.

1600
01:15:20.367 --> 01:15:22.333
We're here at
the iconic waterfall

1601
01:15:22.467 --> 01:15:24.633
in this beautiful
tropical rain forest.

1602
01:15:24.767 --> 01:15:26.633
And if you time it just right.

1603
01:15:26.767 --> 01:15:28.233
you might be able
to catch the sun

1604
01:15:28.367 --> 01:15:29.734
shining through the mist.

1605
01:15:29.867 --> 01:15:31.633
which creates these
incredible rainbows.

1606
01:15:31.767 --> 01:15:33.633
And it's a beautiful
hike to get here as well.

1607
01:15:33.767 --> 01:15:35.233
My feet
can attest to the fact

1608
01:15:35.367 --> 01:15:37.633
that it is indeed
off the beaten path.

1609
01:15:37.767 --> 01:15:39.834
I told you to wear
comfy shoes. I told him!

1610
01:15:39.967 --> 01:15:41.166
When will I ever learn?

1611
01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:43.166
-[laughs]
-[water rippling]

1612
01:15:47.533 --> 01:15:51.467
Well. Ben. it looks like this
is the end of our journey.

1613
01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:55.133
So it would seem.
What was your favorite part?

1614
01:15:55.266 --> 01:16:00.333
Oh. well. it's hard
to pick just one.

1615
01:16:00.467 --> 01:16:04.133
We went snorkeling.
saw some beautiful sunsets.

1616
01:16:04.266 --> 01:16:06.900
Ate some really good food.
Went to a luau.

1617
01:16:07.033 --> 01:16:08.233
We even danced.

1618
01:16:08.367 --> 01:16:11.033
Whoa. Hey. now.
one of us danced.

1619
01:16:11.166 --> 01:16:13.133
I don't know what
you were doing there.

1620
01:16:13.266 --> 01:16:16.500
That's not fair.
I'm a great dancer.

1621
01:16:19.033 --> 01:16:22.266
I had a lot of fun at the
dance with you. I really did.

1622
01:16:23.967 --> 01:16:26.734
Me too. Thank you.

1623
01:16:26.867 --> 01:16:29.734
[water rippling]

1624
01:16:29.867 --> 01:16:31.633
And thank you.

1625
01:16:31.767 --> 01:16:34.200
We hope you enjoyed
our visit to Hawaii.

1626
01:16:34.333 --> 01:16:36.667
-I'm Paige Marshall.
-And I'm Ben Burton.

1627
01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:39.166
We wish you well
on your journey to...

1628
01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:41.266
your Next Destination.

1629
01:16:43.967 --> 01:16:46.667
Wherever it may be.

1630
01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:49.867
-And cut. That's perfect.
-I agree.

1631
01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.834
Um. we can do another
take if you want.

1632
01:16:51.967 --> 01:16:53.800
No. no. no. that's good.
that was it. that was the one.

1633
01:16:53.934 --> 01:16:56.166
Okay. ladies and gentlemen.

1634
01:16:56.300 --> 01:17:00.233
that is a wrap on
Next Destination: Hawaii.

1635
01:17:00.367 --> 01:17:03.467
[cheers and applause]

1636
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.066
Paige. great work.
You know. I was thinking.

1637
01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:12.367
we can script some of that
spontaneous banter you guys do.

1638
01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:14.100
Or we can plan out
what to say.

1639
01:17:14.233 --> 01:17:15.934
Todd. we can't plan...

1640
01:17:16.066 --> 01:17:18.033
Can we talk about this
later? I really...

1641
01:17:18.166 --> 01:17:20.700
You know. Millie was
talking about Morocco
for next season.

1642
01:17:20.834 --> 01:17:22.300
But what about Japan?

1643
01:17:22.433 --> 01:17:25.233
I think that might be of
more interest to our viewers.

1644
01:17:25.367 --> 01:17:28.100
Listen. I've got this
great idea. right? We start...

1645
01:17:28.233 --> 01:17:30.600
[engine revving]

1646
01:17:34.233 --> 01:17:37.300
So. Luis. I gotta ask you.

1647
01:17:37.433 --> 01:17:39.133
are you sure you wanna
come with me?

1648
01:17:39.266 --> 01:17:41.333
'Cause I know that Millie would
love to have you stay on.

1649
01:17:41.467 --> 01:17:44.066
Hey. wherever you go.
I go. remember?

1650
01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:45.967
Thanks. pal.
I owe you one.

1651
01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:48.834
I got paid to spend
a few weeks in paradise
with my best friend.

1652
01:17:48.967 --> 01:17:50.467
I think we're even.

1653
01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:53.100
Listen. you know
what I was thinking?

1654
01:17:53.233 --> 01:17:54.934
When we get to Australia.

1655
01:17:55.066 --> 01:17:57.667
we should do a couple
of days of research.

1656
01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:00.367
You? Research?

1657
01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:02.667
It's just I don't want us
to miss anything. you know?

1658
01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:05.667
But that's not the Bold World
way. though. right?

1659
01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:07.333
What do you
worry about missing?

1660
01:18:11.934 --> 01:18:16.433
Paige.
I'm gonna miss Paige.

1661
01:18:18.967 --> 01:18:23.433
She made me better.
and she made me crazy. but...

1662
01:18:25.667 --> 01:18:28.533
she opened me up
in ways. I haven't been
in a long time.

1663
01:18:28.667 --> 01:18:29.900
you know that.

1664
01:18:33.266 --> 01:18:35.266
Its not gonna be
the same without her.

1665
01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:39.734
I'm not gonna be
the same without her.

1666
01:18:41.033 --> 01:18:42.467
[man over PA] Aloha.

1667
01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:45.533
Welcome passengers
on Flight 493.

1668
01:18:45.667 --> 01:18:48.367
nonstop to Sydney. Australia.

1669
01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:50.900
We're going to be starting
the pre-board process

1670
01:18:51.033 --> 01:18:52.633
in a few minutes.

1671
01:18:52.767 --> 01:18:54.667
Passengers may be seated...

1672
01:19:01.233 --> 01:19:04.200
[Millie]
Thinking about going up?

1673
01:19:04.333 --> 01:19:07.967
No. [chuckles] I'm just
gonna live vicariously
through other people.

1674
01:19:09.667 --> 01:19:13.100
Oh. honey. I think you know
that living vicariously

1675
01:19:13.233 --> 01:19:15.133
is not really living at all.

1676
01:19:15.266 --> 01:19:19.033
Yeah. I guess
I'm just not that good

1677
01:19:19.166 --> 01:19:22.600
at being bold on my own.

1678
01:19:22.734 --> 01:19:25.367
I kinda need....

1679
01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:28.100
And what would you
do if Ben were here?

1680
01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:32.800
I'd... I'd quit.

1681
01:19:32.934 --> 01:19:39.700
I'd say. "Millie I am
tired of pretending

1682
01:19:39.834 --> 01:19:43.600
like I have this great
plan for my life.

1683
01:19:43.734 --> 01:19:48.266
when I actually have no real
power to make it happen.

1684
01:19:50.734 --> 01:19:53.533
I'm tired of waiting for
other people to say yes.

1685
01:19:53.667 --> 01:19:58.166
when I wanna do
the things that I wanna do.

1686
01:19:59.567 --> 01:20:02.066
I wanna go snorkeling.
and UTV-ing.

1687
01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:05.967
and laugh along with the
people who are laughing at me

1688
01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:08.967
when I do dumb things.

1689
01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:11.900
And then I would...

1690
01:20:12.033 --> 01:20:14.767
[sighs]

1691
01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:17.967
go on a turn to Ben
and say.

1692
01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:19.600
"Let's go
and see the world."

1693
01:20:23.934 --> 01:20:25.633
Millie. I quit.

1694
01:20:25.767 --> 01:20:28.533
-Wait. what?
-Yeah.

1695
01:20:28.667 --> 01:20:30.800
Well. I-I didn't think
you were serious!

1696
01:20:30.934 --> 01:20:32.900
Do you really
need me to repeat?

1697
01:20:33.033 --> 01:20:36.567
[stammering]
No. I just. I thought
that was just musings.

1698
01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:39.867
Paige. as the executive
producer of Next Destination.

1699
01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.800
I have to tell you
that is totally unacceptable.

1700
01:20:42.934 --> 01:20:44.133
You made a commitment to me

1701
01:20:44.266 --> 01:20:46.600
and everybody that
works on this show.

1702
01:20:46.734 --> 01:20:48.367
and for you to just
throw that all away

1703
01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:50.767
without any regard to
the impact that it has.

1704
01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:54.734
it's both unprofessional.
and shortsighted.

1705
01:20:54.867 --> 01:20:56.200
What is this?

1706
01:20:56.333 --> 01:20:57.700
That is Ben's
flight information.

1707
01:20:57.834 --> 01:20:59.433
and if you hurry up.
you can still catch him.

1708

-[soft music]
-[sighs]

1709
01:21:02.633 --> 01:21:04.633
I'm getting better
at this feelings thing.

1710
01:21:04.767 --> 01:21:07.033
-[Millie laughs]
-What about Todd?

1711
01:21:07.166 --> 01:21:09.200
I'll just double
his wardrobe budget.
he'll be fine.

1712
01:21:09.333 --> 01:21:10.967
-[Paige laughs]
-Go!

1713
01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:15.533
Then go!

1714
01:21:17.333 --> 01:21:18.367
Ow.

1715
01:21:20.133 --> 01:21:23.734
Hey...
that's a lot.

1716
01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:27.834
[gentle music]

1717
01:21:31.266 --> 01:21:32.533

1719
01:21:42.266 --> 01:21:44.633
[exhales]
Thank you.

1720
01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:53.133
The flight to Australia.

1721
01:21:55.166 --> 01:21:57.834
-[soft music]
-What?

1722
01:21:57.967 --> 01:22:00.533
[soft music]

1723
01:22:43.033 --> 01:22:44.433
You missed your flight.

1724
01:22:44.567 --> 01:22:46.066
What can I say?

1725
01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:48.100
I wanted one last
Hawaiian sunset.

1726
01:22:49.133 --> 01:22:50.400
[soft chuckle]

1727
01:22:50.533 --> 01:22:51.867
I heard you bought
a plane ticket

1728
01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
to try and catch me
at the gate.

1729
01:22:54.133 --> 01:22:55.233
Is that what you heard?

1730
01:22:55.367 --> 01:22:58.333
Oh. yeah.
that's what I heard.

1731
01:22:58.467 --> 01:23:00.633
-Hmm.
-[Paige laughs]

1732
01:23:03.567 --> 01:23:04.667
So. what do we do now?

1733
01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:09.400
Oh... [laughs]
I don't know.

1734
01:23:09.533 --> 01:23:11.800
-I don't have a job.
-Yeah.

1735
01:23:11.934 --> 01:23:15.000
I don't have a plan.

1736
01:23:15.133 --> 01:23:18.667
I don't know where I'm going.

1737
01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:21.066
I just hope that
it's with you.

1738
01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:24.033
[wind whooshing]

1739
01:23:27.033 --> 01:23:30.367
You know what?
I've got a plan.

1740
01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:35.567
Come on. where are we?
Let me take this thing off.

1741
01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:38.567
No. no. not yet.
[laughs]

1742
01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:40.834
Okay. It's your show.

1743
01:23:40.967 --> 01:23:43.433
Well. we couldn't go
when we were in Hawaii.

1744
01:23:43.567 --> 01:23:46.967
so I thought we
would go now in...

1745
01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:49.266
Bali!

1746
01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:51.133
Oh. yes! Luis.

1747
01:23:51.266 --> 01:23:52.834
You gotta see this.
Move forward.

1748
01:23:52.967 --> 01:23:54.767
[Luis] I'm not
getting anywhere near

1749
01:23:54.900 --> 01:23:57.400
the edge of that platform.

1750
01:23:57.533 --> 01:23:59.834
Well. if you like this.

1751
01:23:59.967 --> 01:24:02.633
then you're gonna
love where we go next.

1752
01:24:02.767 --> 01:24:05.867
As long as I'm with you.
I know I'm gonna love it.
