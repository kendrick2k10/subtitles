00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.140
- [Eric] Trying to understand
what mindfulness is.

3
00:00:05.206 --> 00:00:08.114
It doesn't help with
the term. first of all.

5
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.484
- [Manijeh] Usually. I don't
even use the word mindfulness.

6
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.294
it's not necessary.

7
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.304
Terminology reduces it.

8
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.254
- [Eric] But if we go to the root word.

9
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.684
it really means to remember.

10
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.934
To stay mindful of something

11
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.274
is to remember to stay in contact

12
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.371
or being aware of something.

13
00:00:27.437 --> 00:00:30.270
(energetic music)

14
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.934
I remember my brother had an
old GTO that he was rebuilding

15
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.504
and it had these big. powerful oil brakes

16
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.864
and he had been changing the brake fluid.

17
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:32.697
I took it for a drive.

18
00:01:32.763 --> 00:01:34.254
he said. "Just be really mindful.

19
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.534
you're gonna need a lot more time to break

20
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.494
because there's not
something wrong with it.

21
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.054
So pushing down of the brake
took a lot more force."

22
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.424
So as I'm driving along.

23
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.764
I have to be really aware of
cars and people on streets.

24
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.534
street signs. stop lights.

25
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.604
So what am I really doing?

26
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.525
I'm holding one thing.

27
00:01:51.591 --> 00:01:56.591
I need to remember not to
forget to brake in enough time

28
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.424
while managing all this other stuff.

29
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.794
So mindfulness as a
meditation practice is.

30
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.894
oh. your attention is
something that is absorbed

31
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.234
in everything that you're doing

32
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.134
if you're "paying attention."

33
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.194
But you're not paying attention

34
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.424
to how you're paying attention.

35
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.084
you're not paying attention to your body.

36
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.574
and you're not paying attention
to the thoughts that you're having.

37
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.983
that really are running at high speed.

38
00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:23.824
because you haven't trained
yourself to do that.

39
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.684
So mindfulness is asking you

40
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.580
to remember to pay attention to yourself

41
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.204
in the moments of your life
as you're doing things.

42
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.074
as you're talking to people.

43
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.734
as you're making a sandwich.
as you're driving your car.

44
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.434
Can you be aware of this
beautiful. extraordinary.

45
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.584
mysterious body and mind
as you're doing things?

46
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.974
Now to do that. we have to
train informal practices

47
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.434
to cultivate a part of the mind

48
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.814
that could observe everything
else that's going on.

49
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.980
and remember to do it.

50
00:02:52.878 --> 00:02:54.944
And that's why it's called mindfulness.

51
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.494
- I grew up in a very religious home.

52
00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.784
We were Southern Baptist.

53
00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:59.964
And I think it's kind of funny

54
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.794
because I grew up in Seattle.

55
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.244
which is pretty much as
North as you can get.

56
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.284
And my family found the one
Southern Baptist Church.

57
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.484
But I loved it.

58
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.074
I loved the ritual and the ceremony.

59
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.157
I loved the feeling of connectedness

60
00:03:14.223 --> 00:03:18.254
that I experienced when I
was there. but I'm queer.

61
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.584
And so when I was 14 or so

62
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.205
and started to become very aware

63
00:03:23.271 --> 00:03:25.433
of the fact that I was gay.

64
00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:30.499
I knew both intuitively and also blatantly

65
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.154
based off of some of the
teachings that I was hearing

66
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.834
in my youth group and things like.

67
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.094
that the God of my
understanding at that time

68
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.484
did not have a place for me in his home.

69
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.334
Thankfully. I had a fierce mother

70
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.184
and a very loving family unit

71
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.144
that supported me
unconditionally. and I just left.

72
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.424
And it was oddly enough.
easy for me to cut ties.

73
00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.144
But I will say that

74
00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.924
there was always a space left open.

75
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.904
almost like an energetic
hole that was created

76
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.053
when I left that.

77
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.110
- My childhood and my early
adulthood were very difficult.

78
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.964
filled with adversity.

79
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.034
When I was born.

80
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.100
I was born with a bilateral.
it's called club feet.

81
00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.234
And it's a congenital foot condition

82
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.374
where your feet are deformed.

83
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.914
My mom saw that my feet were misshaped.

84
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.104
And she told the doctor

85
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.444
and the doctor's like.
"He's going to be fine."

86
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.994
And at six months or whatever age it was

87
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.824
for me to start wearing shoes.

88
00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.624
shoes weren't fitting me properly.

89
00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.994
and they just kept falling off of my feet.

90
00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.431
So my mom took me into the
doctor and they're like.

91
00:04:43.497 --> 00:04:45.544
"Well. let's correct his feet."

92
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.204
And that's when I had my first
surgery at like six months.

93
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.270
My earliest memories is of
these casts I had to wear.

94
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.824
'cause after the surgery.

95
00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.184
then they cast your feet
so that they mold and form

96
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.924
when they heal properly.

97
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.774
The day before.

98
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.504
I would have to go in
and get my foot wrapped.

99
00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.094
the doctor would want the
cast removed off of me

100
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.614
to just let the incision breathe out.

101
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.564
heal. get some air.

102
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.024
So my mom told me that

103
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.914
she used to have to soak me
in a tub for hours and hours

104
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.994
to get the dressing off of the cast.

105
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.864
And I'm just six months old.

106
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.974
not knowing what's going on. crying.

107
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.404
Think of how traumatic this is.

108
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.834
like this is my mom. your caregiver.

109
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.514
who's doing this to you.

110
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.444
And yes. her intentions are well

111
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.804
and to help me.

112
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.620
but I didn't know that at the time.

113
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.154
I had no friends.

114
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.754
Another layer was that
also my home environment

115
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.194
was also very stressful.

116
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.044
So that was like another layer on top of

117
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.339
not only dealing with that.

118
00:05:54.405 --> 00:05:56.504
but then to a certain extent.

119
00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:01.564
suffering certain verbal and
physical abuse within the home.

120
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.236
So whenever I would swear.

121
00:06:04.302 --> 00:06:07.776
or sometimes when I did something
that my mom didn't like.

122
00:06:07.842 --> 00:06:10.202
I would get held down

123
00:06:10.268 --> 00:06:12.934
and I would get my mouth
washed out with soap.

124
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And as a small kid. having
your parent. your guardian.

125
00:06:18.892 --> 00:06:23.339
your protector physically hold you down

126
00:06:23.405 --> 00:06:27.654
and shove something into
your mouth is very traumatic.

127
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.784
I guess. I started to cope through food.

128
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.964
It was the only way I knew how.

129
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.204
I didn't have any coping
skills at the time.

130
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.224
And eventually. I grew up as a fat kid.

131
00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.914
And then once I did start going to school.

132
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.594
then I started to get bullied
because of the way I walked.

133
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.744
And then I had to wear special
shoes because of my feet.

134
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.734
I also had large male breasts.

135
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.494
It's a certain medical
condition called gynaecomastia.

136
00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.743
So the trauma just continued
outside of the home.

137
00:07:01.809 --> 00:07:04.187
For me. there was so much fear

138
00:07:04.253 --> 00:07:09.144
that I would just hold
my head down and just.

139
00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.404
I was crying on the inside.

140
00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.900
but I wouldn't show it to the bullies.

141
00:07:13.966 --> 00:07:16.213
but on the inside I was crying.

142
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.354
but I didn't wanna show that.

143
00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.324
And I would just put my head down

144
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:21.833
and walk fast past them.

145
00:07:23.075 --> 00:07:25.027
I would just come home
and just shove my face

146
00:07:25.093 --> 00:07:28.644
and just completely numb myself.

147
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:32.035
I would eat to the point
of just getting sleepy.

148
00:07:32.101 --> 00:07:35.146
And then I would just play video games.

149
00:07:35.212 --> 00:07:38.684
and it's still is tough.

150
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.685
I'm very cautious around groups of people.

151
00:07:41.751 --> 00:07:43.441
because I don't know

152
00:07:43.507 --> 00:07:47.814
or I have this history of
childhood experience of trauma

153
00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.614
of people bullying me. picking on me.

154
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.484
So I have this view that
the world's a scary place.

155
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.314
And that's like my natural orientation.

156
00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.124
Mindfulness has really helped me

157
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.123
overcome many of those issues.

158
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.913
I wouldn't say cure myself.

159
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:09.314
because they're still there.

160
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.984
as far as some of the
symptoms I experience.

161
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:16.194
but I would say that mindfulness
has helped me more healed

162
00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:17.433
from the past trauma.

163
00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:21.434
- I had a really interesting introduction.

164
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.654
and it actually says a lot about

165
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.564
what the viewer or the
practitioner might consider

166
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:29.894
when thinking about.

167
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:30.964
this is such a great practice.

168
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:32.526
I want to share it with other people.

169
00:08:32.592 --> 00:08:35.934
So some of the people in my mom's sphere

170
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.974
were really extraordinary people.

171
00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:42.118
in that whenever they talked
to me or I'd visit them.

172
00:08:42.184 --> 00:08:45.623
I felt like I was the most
important person in the world.

173
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:50.634
They're focused on me and their
interest in me was palpable.

174
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.254
And because my mom was
struggling with trauma.

175
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.224
my father was busy working.

176
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:56.554
and my brother was eight
years older than me.

177
00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.604
so he really was more
like a cousin in some ways

178
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.034
because he was off to the races early.

179
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.044
Having that kind of attention

180
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.594
from somebody was really
profoundly nurturing.

181
00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.961
And later on. I found out
these were meditation teachers.

182
00:09:08.027 --> 00:09:10.054
and they never told me they
were meditation teachers.

183
00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.234
They never said.
"Brian. you should really read this book.

184
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.544
or you should try this
meditation practice."

185
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:15.994
They never said anything.

186
00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:19.354
What they did was they embodied curiosity.

187
00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.664
they embodied radical compassion.

188
00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:23.654
they embodied kindness and gentleness.

189
00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.307
all human beings crave that.

190
00:09:25.373 --> 00:09:26.614
So I was craving it.

191
00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.254
And when I found out who they were.

192
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.664
it was right about when
I was 25 years old.

193
00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:34.504
I had gone through my own
dating odysseys and dramas.

194
00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:36.564
and I found this amazing
girl I was dating.

195
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:38.914
And I told her that all
these family friends

196
00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:39.894
were meditation teachers.

197
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.566
that have I been wanting to
do meditation for a long time

198
00:09:41.632 --> 00:09:43.284
but I didn't know how to start.

199
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:44.744
And she said. "Well.
you have to do it now.

200
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:46.414
this is your time."

201
00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:50.024
And so I began formal
practice right around.

202
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:51.424
just before I turned 26.

203
00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:53.734
that was 27 years ago.

204
00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.908
- I met a man who taught
mindfulness. who was a teacher.

205
00:09:57.974 --> 00:10:01.514
but I didn't know he was
a teacher when I met him.

206
00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.904
So we were dating and he
was teaching meditation.

207
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.464
So just to be with him.

208
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.542
I would go sit in the meditation classes.

209
00:10:09.608 --> 00:10:13.874
and I loved what he had to say.

210
00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:18.940
but the meditation was so hard. oh my God.

211
00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:24.374
I tell my students so they know
that if it's hard for them.

212
00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.694
yes. it was so difficult.

213
00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:32.760
that the entire time. whatever
time we sat to meditate.

214
00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:37.850
I was thinking never
able to feel my breath.

215
00:10:38.973 --> 00:10:42.784
Maybe in an hour. I was
feeling my breath one time.

216
00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:47.514
- The pain is actually what
brought me to mindfulness.

217
00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:52.580
I was going to therapy at
Kaiser. and therapy was helping.

218
00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.794
It was bringing a lot of
understanding to my past.

219
00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:00.532
but it wasn't bringing much relief to it.

220
00:11:00.598 --> 00:11:02.984
I still had the symptoms.

221
00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:04.794
I was aware of my symptoms.

222
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.644
but I didn't know how to manage them.

223
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:08.311
So then finally. they suggested.

224
00:11:08.377 --> 00:11:10.054
"Well. why don't you try mindfulness?"

225
00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.331
And I thought.

226
00:11:11.397 --> 00:11:16.397
"Well. me meditate with my
busy. crazy mind. no way."

227
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:19.464
But I went to a class

228
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:23.224
and I discovered that it
was nothing what I thought.

229
00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:26.556
that it's not so much
of emptying your mind.

230
00:11:26.622 --> 00:11:31.622
more it's just noticing
what your mind is stuck on.

231
00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:34.434
where your mind is at.

232
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:38.114
Is it on a thought. what
type of thought is it?

233
00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:39.594
Is it a negative thought?

234
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:41.664
Is it a pleasant thought?

235
00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:45.094
What is that thought doing to your body?

236
00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.294
What kind of reactions are going on?

237
00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.084
Is it causing your heart to race?

238
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:54.828
So that gave me something to
do. like to pay attention to

239
00:11:54.894 --> 00:11:57.104
while I was meditating.

240
00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:59.334
it gave me stuff to focus on.

241
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.324
And once I started to
practice mindfulness.

242
00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:07.174
I started to be able to learn
how to create some distance

243
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.794
between my mind and my thoughts.

244
00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.524
- For a long time I thought
maybe I'm not smart enough.

245
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:15.204
maybe I'm not educated enough.

246
00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:19.124
I just knew that I really
wanted to explore meditation.

247
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:20.744
I had gone through this process

248
00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:22.584
where I had just ended

249
00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:26.064
a stint of being on
television for three years.

250
00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:28.934
And I made this business investment

251
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.544
that went south very
quickly. I lost all my money.

252
00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:33.510
and I was like.

253
00:12:33.576 --> 00:12:36.464
"I got to try a new path here."

254
00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:38.624
I was recently sober.

255
00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:41.972
and I just intuitively
knew that meditation

256
00:12:42.038 --> 00:12:44.964
was something that was
going to really serve me.

257
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:47.924
So I started volunteering
at a Buddhist bookstore.

258
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:51.024
I started taking every opportunity I could

259
00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:54.104
to learn how to meditate to quiet my mind.

260
00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:56.934
learn the practices. learn the discipline.

261
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.264
And out of that arose
a desire to give back.

262
00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.544
not only give back to society.

263
00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:04.894
but to give back to my specific community.

264
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.924
the LGBTQ community.

265
00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:09.134
So I came up with an idea

266
00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.974
to start hosting spiritual services.

267
00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.764
spiritual events in gay bars.

268
00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:14.914
And that's what I did.

269
00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:19.284
And so in 2010. I got
the keys to a gay bar.

270
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:22.484
they weren't charging me rent
or anything. Sunday mornings.

271
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:25.462
and my mentor and I started
doing these services

272
00:13:25.528 --> 00:13:27.504
in gay bars in West Hollywood.

273
00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.384
And it just grew and grew and it grew.

274
00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:33.294
And 10 years later. I am
now a licensed minister.

275
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.994
I've offered hundreds and hundreds

276
00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:38.504
and hundreds of teaching
on spiritual living.

277
00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:43.504
I lead meditation retreats.
and it was all an accident.

278
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:44.964
this wasn't the plan.

279
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:46.924
it wasn't what I was supposed to be doing.

280
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:51.369
However. as my career in
television continued to grow.

281
00:13:51.435 --> 00:13:54.424
my discomfort dissatisfied.

282
00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:56.374
I was just so bored doing it.

283
00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.724
And I felt such vibrancy.

284
00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:02.714
I felt so alive when I
was teaching this work

285
00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:05.524
and dedicating myself deeper and deeper

286
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:10.154
to my own spiritual practice
that I knew this was it.

287
00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:13.854
- I did not know what
mindfulness was at all.

288
00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.594
I even asked the psychiatrist.
"What is mindfulness?"

289
00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:19.124
And she said. "Well.
it's a meditation class."

290
00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:20.561
And that's when I thought to myself.

291
00:14:20.627 --> 00:14:25.170
"Me meditate. yeah. right.
calm my mind. empty it."

292
00:14:25.236 --> 00:14:28.754
But I was desperate. and I
thought I'd give it a shot.

293
00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.294
What I learned was that

294
00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.624
it's not about emptying your mind at all.

295
00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:36.672
instead. it's just noticing
where your mind is.

296
00:14:36.738 --> 00:14:41.014
what it's focusing on.
what its habits are.

297
00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.926
And when I understood that.

298
00:14:42.992 --> 00:14:47.992
that gave me things to do as
I was practicing mindfulness.

299
00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.054
Now there are times where.

300
00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.844
as I'm practicing mindfulness.

301
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:56.094
my mind completely goes silent.

302
00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.954
And that's wonderful when that happens.

303
00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:59.645
And I enjoy those times.

304
00:14:59.711 --> 00:15:03.954
But in the beginning. I
primarily use mindfulness

305
00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:07.774
just as a way of escaping my busy head.

306
00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.244
they're called ANTs.

307
00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:11.984
it's called automatic negative thinking.

308
00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:15.254
And these are just our automatic
thoughts that automate.

309
00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.194
We have a negativity bias.

310
00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.664
What the bias is. is that
at the end of the day.

311
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:22.209
we tend to think about all
the things that go wrong.

312
00:15:22.275 --> 00:15:24.564
or if we're involved in a project.

313
00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:26.944
or if we have a job interview.

314
00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:29.647
even if we receive a 95%.

315
00:15:29.713 --> 00:15:33.694
we focus on that 5% that we didn't get.

316
00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:38.760
Mindfulness helped me
identify my negativity bias.

317
00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:41.333
And once I became aware of it.

318
00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:45.411
I was able to start questioning it

319
00:15:45.477 --> 00:15:50.254
and questioning the validity
of it and how accurate it is.

320
00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.014
- The people I started studying with

321
00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.564
were people who were practicing

322
00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:55.254
something called the Fourth Way.

323
00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.794
which is not derived from
Buddhism as mindfulness is.

324
00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:03.174
it's an embodied practice
of awareness attention

325
00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.564
and self-discovery.

326
00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:08.784
that has its origins in
the Transcaucasus region

327
00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:10.744
and the areas around India.

328
00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:13.234
it was brought to the West
by a man named Gurdjieff.

329
00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:14.348
At that time.

330
00:16:14.414 --> 00:16:17.174
mindfulness was not something
that I was aware of.

331
00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.914
There was something
called mindfulness-based

332
00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.874
stress reduction that was
being studied in universities

333
00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:22.952
and hospital settings.

334
00:16:23.018 --> 00:16:25.674
dealing with chronic
pain and chronic stress.

335
00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:28.169
but it really hadn't reached anything

336
00:16:28.235 --> 00:16:30.834
in terms of the common knowledge.

337
00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:32.374
There was lots of Buddhism was around.

338
00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.224
there was lots of meditation Taoism.

339
00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:35.434
other kinds of practices.

340
00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.414
but mindfulness as we understand it now

341
00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.834
as a secular practice

342
00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:42.484
extracted from Buddhist
training was not around at all.

343
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:43.843
One of the things that was remarkable

344
00:16:43.909 --> 00:16:46.504
was that all these people

345
00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:47.989
who invited me to practice with them

346
00:16:48.055 --> 00:16:52.384
had waited for me to be
hungry and seek something.

347
00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:54.354
rather than just see that I was struggling

348
00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.484
with something and
suggest here's a solution.

349
00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:58.192
So they had this interesting wisdom about.

350
00:16:58.258 --> 00:17:02.024
when you really are ready
for something. you seek it.

351
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:05.144
and you're more willing
to take on the challenge.

352
00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:08.284
- Mindfulness is a contemplative practice.

353
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:12.114
Contemplative practices have
existed cross-culturally

354
00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:13.874
for thousands of years.

355
00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.604
Mindfulness is from Eastern.

356
00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:21.670
What it means is Vipassana
or insight meditation.

357
00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:24.295
The reason why it's
gaining so much momentum

358
00:17:24.361 --> 00:17:29.084
is now science is starting to
validate that it's beneficial.

359
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:33.361
There is a. his name is Dr.Jon Kabat-Zinn.

360
00:17:33.427 --> 00:17:36.004
he is a psychologist.

361
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:39.844
He broke down mindfulness
into an eight-week program.

362
00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:41.484
because what we first need to do

363
00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:44.614
is we need to break down
things into numbers.

364
00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.334
We need to have a program.

365
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.266
we need to see how long the program is.

366
00:17:48.332 --> 00:17:50.805
and then we need to
measure people's results

367
00:17:50.871 --> 00:17:53.964
before and after they've
received the program.

368
00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:55.574
So his program was working.

369
00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.675
He noticed that people
dealing with chronic pain

370
00:17:58.741 --> 00:18:01.675
weren't really benefiting much.

371
00:18:01.741 --> 00:18:05.393
that pain medication had its limitations.

372
00:18:07.625 --> 00:18:10.017
that medicine has its limitations.

373
00:18:10.083 --> 00:18:13.744
And once we hit those
limitations. then what do we do.

374
00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:15.593
'cause the person is still in pain.

375
00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:21.447
So he found tremendous benefits
in Buddhist philosophy.

376
00:18:21.513 --> 00:18:24.324
So what he did was he stripped the.

377
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:27.129
like the religious aspects out of it.

378
00:18:27.195 --> 00:18:30.572
and he came up with just
practical techniques

379
00:18:30.638 --> 00:18:34.124
as far as noticing
thoughts. noticing emotions.

380
00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:36.054
And he came up with the program.

381
00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.924
And what this program did was it allowed

382
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:41.524
for people to measure the
effectiveness of mindfulness.

383
00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:46.590
He found that people
reported not only less pain.

384
00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:51.113
but also that people reported
better qualities of life.

385
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.033
- No. I didn't.

386
00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:58.634
That's why I have a lot of
compassion for my students.

387
00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:02.334
I stuck with it because of my boyfriend.

388
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.354
who was a teacher. and because
of the teaching service.

389
00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:11.420
the teachings were so high-level.
so kind and so logical.

390
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:16.328
I didn't have to believe in something.

391
00:19:16.394 --> 00:19:19.624
I could verify for myself.

392
00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:21.804
there was no judgment in it.

393
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:24.704
So that's what kept me actually.

394
00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:27.754
not the practice of meditation.

395
00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:32.024
When we talk about mindfulness meditation.

396
00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:34.494
which kind of distinguishes it

397
00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.094
from other types of meditation.

398
00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.274
there are literally hundreds
of types of meditation

399
00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:41.324
that come from different traditions.

400
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:44.994
religions. or philosophies or systems.

401
00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:49.083
and each one have their
own structure and outcome.

402
00:19:50.412 --> 00:19:54.204
Meditation is a specific
type of meditation.

403
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:57.994
but mindfulness. as a space of mind

404
00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.718
is not particular to anybody.

405
00:20:00.784 --> 00:20:04.544
For example. let's say you went somewhere

406
00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:08.314
and had a meal and this
was a brand new dish.

407
00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:11.144
you never had experienced it before.

408
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.411
So you become more in tune like.

409
00:20:13.477 --> 00:20:15.684
"Let me see. wow."

410
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:20.124
You take your bite and you
really about this thing.

411
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:22.181
And before your mind comes and says.

412
00:20:22.247 --> 00:20:24.804
"Oh yeah. it tastes like this
and it tastes like that."

413
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:27.674
you have a moment of no opinion.

414
00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:31.754
just experiencing and watching. "Wow."

415
00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.513
Just like I told my.

416
00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:39.214
I teach ADD mindfulness
for people with ADHD.

417
00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.821
And so I told them that.

418
00:20:40.887 --> 00:20:44.316
"Okay. it's like we have these templates

419
00:20:44.382 --> 00:20:47.364
of the ways we think.

420
00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:50.844
When you are in that space of mindfulness.

421
00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:53.694
you are detached from that template."

422
00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:54.994
- I would say that mindfulness

423
00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:57.214
addresses the human condition.

424
00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:00.644
There are many wisdom
traditions. religious traditions.

425
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:02.024
philosophical traditions

426
00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:04.640
that recognize and question
the nature of the mind.

427
00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:06.524
It just so happens

428
00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:11.504
that Buddhist cultures
committed themselves culturally

429
00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:16.074
to a systematic description
of what ails the mind

430
00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:19.294
in a systematic practice
to rebalance the mind.

431
00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.430
But really. they're not
inventing anything new.

432
00:21:21.496 --> 00:21:23.624
The reason why it affects everybody

433
00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:25.489
is because everyone has a body.

434
00:21:25.555 --> 00:21:28.838
everyone feels pleasure and discomfort.

435
00:21:28.904 --> 00:21:31.034
wellness and disease.

436
00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:33.624
everyone has a mind that can remember

437
00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:35.464
or imagine that the future.

438
00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:37.324
and everyone wants to feel connected

439
00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:38.594
and want to have a sense of purpose.

440
00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.174
and wants to have some sense of agency

441
00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.461
over what happens to them.

442
00:21:41.527 --> 00:21:44.127
And mindfulness addresses
all those things directly.

443
00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:48.814
- I think mindfulness
is bigger than insight.

444
00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:52.164
Insight arises within mindfulness.

445
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:55.205
The mindfulness space
has to be there first

446
00:21:55.271 --> 00:21:59.294
for the real reliable insight.

447
00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.224
'cause sometimes you could
be thinking that is insight.

448
00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:03.057
and it's really not.

449
00:22:03.123 --> 00:22:08.020
for a reliable aha moment
or realization to happen.

450
00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:13.482
- I became so fascinated by my thoughts.

451
00:22:13.548 --> 00:22:17.134
more so. how my thoughts were dictating

452
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.094
the world I was experiencing.

453
00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.524
And I think that's when you really know

454
00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:24.094
you've tapped into your passion

455
00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.614
when it's all you want to talk about.

456
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:30.324
And I would just go through
books after books. after books.

457
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:33.044
I was like. I would say I
was like a mad scientist.

458
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:36.304
just tearing through documents
and doing different practices

459
00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:38.084
and trying everything.

460
00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:39.894
all to just become more aware

461
00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.444
of the thoughts I was thinking.

462
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:44.104
the patterns that were active in my life.

463
00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:48.664
the belief systems that were
both conscious and unconscious

464
00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:51.024
that were creating the
patterns in my life.

465
00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:55.034
the experiences that I kept
having over and over again.

466
00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:57.915
I think the first step in transformation

467
00:22:57.981 --> 00:23:00.424
is the awareness that you're no longer

468
00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:03.384
interested in experiencing
what you're experiencing.

469
00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:05.404
There's real beauty in contrast.

470
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:08.664
So you become aware that.
"I don't like this anymore.

471
00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:11.214
There's gotta be a different way."

472
00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.514
And in your willingness
to try a new approach.

473
00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:15.554
I truly believe the path is shown.

474
00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.534
So the second step in
transformation is willingness.

475
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:22.644
I am willing to try a new
approach. and in that.

476
00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:24.964
something opens up in your consciousness.

477
00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.754
a door opens or at least cracked open.

478
00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:29.944
And the next step is always shown

479
00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:31.164
and the next step is always shown.

480
00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:34.744
Now. our job is to continue
to cultivate the willingness.

481
00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:35.804
to take the next step.

482
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:37.894
the courage to take the next step.

483
00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:41.144
the willingness to get
out of our comfort zone.

484
00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:45.194
the willingness to explore
and look at the beliefs.

485
00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:46.834
both known and unknown.

486
00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:50.274
that are creating your
experience in the world.

487
00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:53.044
I think right now.

488
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:55.634
socially is a gorgeous time for everybody

489
00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.654
to look at the subconscious programming

490
00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:02.294
that has created your belief systems

491
00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.144
and how you move in the culture.

492
00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:08.464
I am someone who remains willing.

493
00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:12.784
And in fact. I love looking at the blocks

494
00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:15.387
that I don't even realize are there

495
00:24:15.453 --> 00:24:18.474
until they're pointed out to me.

496
00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:21.064
and often times pointed out
to me through meditation.

497
00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:22.600
and sometimes pointed out to me

498
00:24:22.666 --> 00:24:26.042
in something that feels
like big slap in the face.

499
00:24:26.108 --> 00:24:28.654
And I think right now. culturally.

500
00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.944
is an opportunity for us all
to hold ourselves accountable

501
00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:36.773
so that a greater sense of
unity can express itself.

502
00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:38.474
And if you're not willing

503
00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:41.667
to look at your own limited beliefs.

504
00:24:41.733 --> 00:24:43.244
then what are you even doing?

505
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:44.194
- The beauty of it was that

506
00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:49.260
there is surrounding teachings
about kindness. compassion.

507
00:24:49.456 --> 00:24:54.456
and little by little.
that would impact me.

508
00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:00.914
Now. there is a meditation
called loving-kindness meditation

509
00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:04.796
that is also very paralleled
with mindfulness meditation.

510
00:25:04.862 --> 00:25:08.204
I would not give into it.

511
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:12.954
because I believe that. "Oh
my God. I'm kind enough.

512
00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:15.204
I cannot be any more kind.

513
00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:16.664
I cannot give anymore."

514
00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:20.833
I felt like kindness was
what I knew before this.

515
00:25:20.899 --> 00:25:24.814
So I would resist. "Oh.
it's for these other people.

516
00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.044
it's not for me."

517
00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:29.104
And then one day I came to sit.

518
00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:32.204
I decided I'm gonna go sit and meditate.

519
00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:36.121
When I sat to meditate. my mind said.

520
00:25:36.187 --> 00:25:41.187
"Hmm. I'm gonna send
loving-kindness to all the people"

521
00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:46.744
"who have harmed me on my
life just organically."

522
00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:51.304
So I sat there. we had a Sheetz dog. Oreo.

523
00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:53.714
He sat with me meditating.

524
00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:58.144
I close my eyes and I
had like three phrases.

525
00:25:58.210 --> 00:25:59.174
may you be safe.

526
00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.804
may you be healthy and strong.

527
00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:04.047
may you be at ease. free from suffering.

528
00:26:04.113 --> 00:26:08.204
I couldn't finish saying

529
00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:11.784
one series of these phrases for somebody

530
00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:13.544
who came fast enough

531
00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:16.054
until somebody else come to my mind.

532
00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.234
Oh my goodness.

533
00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:21.224
And at the time I had divorced
from my ex-husband too.

534
00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:24.754
so he would come in-between.

535
00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:27.014
So he got most of it really.

536
00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.214
It was incredible.

537
00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.604
It took about 40 minutes.

538
00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:32.291
I just sat there.

539
00:26:32.357 --> 00:26:34.241
And these people came to my mind.

540
00:26:34.307 --> 00:26:39.236
and I remembered why I didn't like them

541
00:26:39.302 --> 00:26:42.184
or what they did to me or something.

542
00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:46.964
And I would send these
kind thoughts to them.

543
00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:49.704
and my stomach would
be like yucky feeling.

544
00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:52.454
It was just like remembering all that.

545
00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:57.520
And so I took a deep breath
and organically it stopped.

546
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.004
I got up. I said. "Okay. let's go. Oreo."

547
00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:02.574
I got up and went and washed my hands.

548
00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:05.344
and went on with my day.

549
00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:06.994
And next day.

550
00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:11.189
I went for a hike with my
friend who is a therapist.

551
00:27:11.255 --> 00:27:13.444
We both went through schooling.

552
00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:17.074
I went to the routes of
organization development.

553
00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:18.554
she went and became a therapist.

554
00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:20.194
So we were hiking.

555
00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:22.934
and I told her about this
experience. I said...

556
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.611
We were talking about my
ex-husband. off course.

557
00:27:25.677 --> 00:27:28.234
"Oh yeah. can imagine he came

558
00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:29.604
and we've seen all these people.

559
00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:30.894
and this is what's happened."

560
00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.144
"So she said. 'What happened?"

561
00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:33.534
"So I told her."

562
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.874
Oh. I went and washed my...

563
00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:39.044
She said. 'What. wait. you
went and washed your hand?

564
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:42.500
"Do you always wash your
hands after meditation?"

565
00:27:42.566 --> 00:27:44.137
I said. "No."

566
00:27:45.357 --> 00:27:49.294
"Huh. oh my God."

567
00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:52.094
She smiled so beautifully.

568
00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:57.133
She said. "It's like symbolically
you washed your hands.

569
00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:00.234
off these people. it's done."

570
00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:05.300
It was just that realization.

571
00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:08.574
It probably would have worked the same.

572
00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.251
but that realization helps me feel like.

573
00:28:11.317 --> 00:28:16.317
"Oh my God. yeah. it's done."

574
00:28:16.762 --> 00:28:19.764
Just that experience alone.

575
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:24.830
I believe sets me on a journey of healing

576
00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:29.523
that was so fundamentally powerful.

577
00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:34.588
- Moments of mindfulness often
bring powerful discoveries.

578
00:28:34.654 --> 00:28:37.624
and some of them are not flattering.

579
00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:39.864
I remember I was on a retreat
once in upstate New York.

580
00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:42.474
it was right after 9/11.
I think it was 2002.

581
00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:45.374
This retreat involved a
lot of working meditation.

582
00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.084
So there were sitting meditation
and moving meditation.

583
00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:49.464
but also working meditation.

584
00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:52.185
So we were assigned to different teams

585
00:28:52.251 --> 00:28:53.954
to do different kinds of work.

586
00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:56.004
Some people were cooking.
some people are cleaning.

587
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:57.544
some people doing landscaping.

588
00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:00.311
I happened to be assigned
to a small building

589
00:29:00.377 --> 00:29:02.204
in this very rural area

590
00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:05.694
that we had to take off
all the roofing tiles.

591
00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.871
And so the idea here in the practice is.

592
00:29:07.937 --> 00:29:11.284
"How do I stay mindful
as I'm climbing a ladder

593
00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:14.284
and bringing up tools and
working with a team of people.

594
00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:17.144
and staying safe and not
falling. and doing the job well.

595
00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:18.874
and it's in the hot side of summer?"

596
00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:20.184
This is one of those things

597
00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:23.254
where you're humbled by the practice.

598
00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.454
It was after 9/11. there
was a lot of tension.

599
00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.014
a lot of anxiety. a lot of distrust.

600
00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.214
a lot of tribalism going on.

601
00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.774
And one of my colleagues

602
00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:35.514
who I'd never met on this
roof. this particular moment

603
00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:37.994
was a young man from Pakistan.

604
00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:40.732
It was a hot. hot day and we
were pulling off roof tiles.

605
00:29:40.798 --> 00:29:41.724
and the idea is that

606
00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:42.864
we're supposed to stay
aware of each other.

607
00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:44.734
but we're not supposed to have anything

608
00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:45.644
but the functional speech.

609
00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:47.504
So we're not gonna talk about the Dodgers.

610
00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:48.481
We're going to just talk about.

611
00:29:48.547 --> 00:29:50.694
"Oh. what kind of tools
do we need for this job."

612
00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:51.724
and then it's silence.

613
00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:54.554
And then you focus on being
aware of the technique.

614
00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.072
yourself and the other person.

615
00:29:56.138 --> 00:29:59.234
And I became aware that I forgot my water.

616
00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:00.563
and it was really hot.

617
00:30:01.688 --> 00:30:04.574
What I noticed as I saw
his bottle of water.

618
00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.674
and I had a whole association.

619
00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:10.684
my mind just went on a story
about who this guy was.

620
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:12.924
And I could see that
he was colored by 9/11.

621
00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:14.424
because he was from Pakistan.

622
00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:17.098
I saw this kind of prejudicial thinking

623
00:30:17.164 --> 00:30:20.054
that projected identity onto him.

624
00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:21.896
And just as I was thinking that.

625
00:30:21.962 --> 00:30:23.784
he turned and grabbed the bottle of water.

626
00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:24.924
and when he was about
to raise it to his face.

627
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:25.951
he looked at me. he said.

628
00:30:26.017 --> 00:30:29.024
"You look so thirsty. you have to drink."

629
00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:34.090
And he pierced the
bubble of that projection

630
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:36.364
of his identity in that moment.

631
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:38.464
And I was just shocked.

632
00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:40.894
I was shocked at the. first of all.

633
00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.464
I had to react to him.

634
00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:44.434
and I took it and drank some cold water.

635
00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:46.254
and was so grateful and thanked him.

636
00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.460
But also. I had this digestion of.

637
00:30:49.526 --> 00:30:50.954
"Oh. that's how prejudice starts.

638
00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:53.744
is these projections of belief on someone

639
00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:55.936
based on tiny bits of information

640
00:30:56.002 --> 00:30:58.536
and conditioned experience."

641
00:30:58.602 --> 00:31:00.744
And that this practice allowed my heart

642
00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:01.816
to open to him immediately.

643
00:31:01.882 --> 00:31:03.864
and seeing my own sleep around that.

644
00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:07.084
my own dreamlike state of

645
00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:09.548
not knowing who the person
is and thinking you do.

646
00:31:09.614 --> 00:31:12.125
So that was a profound experience.

647
00:31:12.191 --> 00:31:14.864
It became part of a
practice of just noticing.

648
00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:18.474
I would see myself at a
cafe or at a Starbucks.

649
00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:19.794
and just practice noticing.

650
00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:21.871
watching my own mind as
I'm drinking my coffee

651
00:31:21.937 --> 00:31:24.592
with the newspaper to kind
of make it less weird.

652
00:31:24.658 --> 00:31:26.294
And I would just look at people's faces

653
00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:29.934
and just notice how my brain
sizes them up as my tribe.

654
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.024
not my tribe.

655
00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:33.974
And it's an automatic
function of the brain.

656
00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:38.144
That part of the brain is not my fault.

657
00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:41.661
It forms from the evolutionary.
a natural selection pressure

658
00:31:41.727 --> 00:31:44.904
because it served a
purpose back in the days

659
00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:48.424
when there was more
tribal fighting happening.

660
00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:49.684
But it's my responsibility

661
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:54.195
not to let that automatic
functioning be the end game.

662
00:31:54.261 --> 00:31:56.334
I have to take responsibility
for that functioning.

663
00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.883
And so I practiced with that all the time.

664
00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:02.903
- I lost my son three years ago.

665
00:32:03.786 --> 00:32:08.786
An incredible. incredible.
incredible tough pain.

666
00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:14.624
that every time

667
00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:18.541
that I got hit with the tsunamis of grief.

668
00:32:18.607 --> 00:32:20.701
the first thing in my mind was.

669
00:32:20.767 --> 00:32:23.604
"May no being ever experience this."

670
00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:26.693
Because the extent of pain.

671
00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:30.854
For the first 35 days.

672
00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:35.413
I fainted every day. because
my brain couldn't handle it.

673
00:32:35.479 --> 00:32:37.634
With my practice. with awareness.

674
00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.754
with compassion. with all that.

675
00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:43.834
more and more and more.
when an emotion comes up.

676
00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:45.694
that is grief.

677
00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:50.760
that it comes up because my
eye caught a picture of him

678
00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:53.594
or a thought came about him.

679
00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:55.864
and that he's no longer here.

680
00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:59.427
the brain produces the emotion of grief

681
00:32:59.493 --> 00:33:03.444
to respond to that stimuli.

682
00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:06.134
'cause the brain is predicting constantly

683
00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.014
what do I need to do.

684
00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:09.004
what do I need to do?
What's next. what's next?

685
00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:11.484
And it's 10 steps ahead of us too.

686
00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:14.731
But with my awareness. I can notice.

687
00:33:14.797 --> 00:33:17.370
"Oh this emotion is present.

688
00:33:17.436 --> 00:33:20.034
Is it necessary?

689
00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:21.542
Is it useful?

690
00:33:21.608 --> 00:33:24.354
Is it conducive to my happiness?"

691
00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:29.284
No. I don't have to
entertain that emotion.

692
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:32.094
Knowledge. practice. understanding.

693
00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:35.740
experience and capability.

694
00:33:35.806 --> 00:33:40.806
that I'm not stuck with
millions of mothers.

695
00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:42.854
like millions of others around the world

696
00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:47.503
for 20 years or 30 years for
the rest of my life being done.

697
00:33:48.983 --> 00:33:51.614
When a child dies. a mother or father.

698
00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:54.103
most often they're done.

699
00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:56.664
they're stuck in that emotion.

700
00:33:56.730 --> 00:33:59.924
because the brain produces that emotion

701
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:02.124
and the person doesn't
know what to do with it.

702
00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:04.034
believes it and goes with it.

703
00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:08.824
But now I can say. no. it
doesn't mean I love my dear.

704
00:34:08.890 --> 00:34:13.890
oh my goodness. my dear son
less. but why should I suffer?

705
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:20.134
It's not necessary to
suffer to prove love.

706
00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:20.967
- And when we hear this

707
00:34:21.033 --> 00:34:25.104
from our Eastern wisdom traditions.

708
00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:27.484
that my enemy is my friend.

709
00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:30.204
or that adversity is my opportunity.

710
00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:31.374
and we just don't want that.

711
00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.207
especially in the West.

712
00:34:32.273 --> 00:34:34.084
we want something that's
gonna be quick and easy.

713
00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:36.274
efficient and get me to
the place I wanna go.

714
00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:39.171
And I don't wanna deal with
all that disturbing crap.

715
00:34:39.237 --> 00:34:44.237
But actually. it's during
crises. during difficult moments

716
00:34:44.528 --> 00:34:48.704
that the software that's running my life.

717
00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:51.834
that I didn't design becomes visible.

718
00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:53.204
because it's not functioning that well.

719
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:55.364
there's some dissonance.
there's some suffering.

720
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:57.311
and that's my opportunity
to see the functioning

721
00:34:57.377 --> 00:35:00.894
and to decide. how can I notice that.

722
00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:03.104
and not fully believe it all the time.

723
00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:07.054
so that I can begin to participate
in evolving my own mind.

724
00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:10.014
I was at a meditation retreat practice.

725
00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.644
where I was part of the serving team.

726
00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:13.875
At the end of the retreat.
there was a dinner.

727
00:35:13.941 --> 00:35:16.264
and I was part of serving
the meal and cleaning up.

728
00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:17.584
And at the very end of the night.

729
00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:20.254
people did a meditation. so it was quiet.

730
00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.574
the dining halls cleaned
up. everything's put away.

731
00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:25.174
And after the meditation was over.

732
00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:26.354
and people were hugging

733
00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:28.854
and kind of talking
about their experience.

734
00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:29.687
I was part of a team.

735
00:35:29.753 --> 00:35:32.814
but what I noticed as I
sat there in my chairs.

736
00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.425
no one came to me.

737
00:35:34.491 --> 00:35:35.364
and all of a sudden

738
00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:39.034
I became profoundly
aware of this narrative

739
00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:41.987
that I have had all my
life. that I'm alone.

740
00:35:42.053 --> 00:35:45.904
and that I'm not really part
of other people's groups.

741
00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:47.454
I had that ever since I was a kid.

742
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.114
I had to work hard to let go of it.

743
00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:50.502
But at this particular juncture.

744
00:35:50.568 --> 00:35:52.672
fairly young in my practice.

745
00:35:52.738 --> 00:35:56.644
it was really painful to sit
there and not be included.

746
00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:58.104
And it's a classic thing.

747
00:35:58.170 --> 00:35:59.276
Now. as a psychotherapist.

748
00:35:59.342 --> 00:36:01.924
I know that people who have social anxiety

749
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:04.304
and who tend to feel lonely.

750
00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:05.234
they're also reticent

751
00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:07.214
to make the step that
could solve that problem

752
00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.644
by just getting up

753
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:09.811
and patting someone on
the back and saying.

754
00:36:09.877 --> 00:36:11.004
"Hey. that was amazing experience.

755
00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:12.314
How was your experience?"

756
00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:16.524
Terrified to do that because
the belief is. no one wants me.

757
00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:18.044
that's why they're not coming to me.

758
00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:20.060
Why would they want me to go to them?

759
00:36:20.126 --> 00:36:21.534
So I remember though.

760
00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.804
some instructions from one of my teachers.

761
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:25.104
that when we're feeling

762
00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:27.764
this extraordinarily effective suffering.

763
00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:29.394
so my body is tight.

764
00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:32.604
and it feels flooded with cortisol

765
00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:34.584
and other chemicals of stress.

766
00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:38.334
and my mind is telling
me. "I don't belong here."

767
00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.191
I remember the practice.

768
00:36:39.257 --> 00:36:41.564
and the practice is just to simply

769
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:43.914
question the truth of that thought

770
00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:46.964
and open my entire attention

771
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:49.155
to all the difficult sensations.

772
00:36:49.221 --> 00:36:52.924
to noticing my mind wants
to pull me out of presence.

773
00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:54.834
come back to presence. stay with the body.

774
00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:56.097
feel the discomfort.

775
00:36:56.163 --> 00:37:01.163
open to it and let it sort of
sizzle and cure me as it were.

776
00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:04.067
and rest and watch this duration.

777
00:37:04.133 --> 00:37:07.854
And it stayed for some time.
maybe two or three minutes.

778
00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:10.794
And then I was able to just notice

779
00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:14.904
that this is a habit of
mind and not the truth.

780
00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:17.894
And I was able to get up and
just say hello to a few people

781
00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:21.354
and walk away feeling totally different.

782
00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:23.554
This methodology is used now

783
00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:25.334
in all kinds of forms of therapy.

784
00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.907
like mindfulness-based relapse prevention.

785
00:37:27.973 --> 00:37:29.964
mindfulness-based cognitive therapy.

786
00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:33.396
and it's helping people.
millions of people deal
with anxiety and depression.

787
00:37:33.462 --> 00:37:35.194
But I discovered it right there.

788
00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:36.944
before I knew about any of those things.

789
00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:38.604
just by applying the practice

790
00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:40.724
right when I wanted to
just get up and leave

791
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:42.024
and run out of the room.

792
00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:43.684
but staying in the fire.

793
00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:45.804
sitting in the fire with compassion

794
00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:48.194
and letting it transform my mind.

795
00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:52.204
- I often say that your
life is your practice.

796
00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:54.484
my life is my practice.

797
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:57.612
And that became very true for me

798
00:37:57.678 --> 00:38:00.944
when I moved through the grieving process

799
00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:04.724
after my son passed away unexpectedly.

800
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:07.424
he was eight months old.

801
00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:10.938
and just a beautiful. healthy little boy.

802
00:38:11.004 --> 00:38:14.214
And he got a stomach bug.

803
00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:17.334
and he just didn't seem to get better.

804
00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:20.304
And I would go to the doctor.
they would send us home.

805
00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:21.774
I took him to the emergency room.

806
00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:25.774
they sent us home. and
finally after one night.

807
00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:27.391
he wasn't keeping anything down.

808
00:38:27.457 --> 00:38:28.754
he was so upset.

809
00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.761
I took him back to the
emergency room and said.

810
00:38:31.827 --> 00:38:33.094
"You gotta look at him.

811
00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.994
Something's not right here."

812
00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:36.994
And he looked a little dehydrated.

813
00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:39.089
So they brought him in
and they were gonna get him on liquids.

814
00:38:39.155 --> 00:38:44.155
And then everything began
to get out of control.

815
00:38:46.847 --> 00:38:48.374
It felt like it was out of control.

816
00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.844
It almost was like I was watching a movie.

817
00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:52.214
those experiences in your life

818
00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:56.034
when you really are just the observer.

819
00:38:56.100 --> 00:39:01.100
And I will always have that
memory of looking down at him.

820
00:39:01.643 --> 00:39:05.314
and he just starts taking
these kinds of gulps of breath.

821
00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:08.064
And I asked the nurse. I'm
like. "What is he doing?"

822
00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:10.824
And then she just said.
"This does not look good."

823
00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:13.140
And suddenly there was
10 people in the room.

824
00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:17.814
They placed a mask on him.

825
00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:19.794
They were pumping air into his lungs.

826
00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:24.580
and they revived him and I
called my husband at work.

827
00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:28.384
And he was glad I was going
to the emergency room.

828
00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:30.244
because he thought it would help me.

829
00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:31.954
'cause he knew I was
going to be at home alone

830
00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:34.554
and he didn't want me to be stressed out.

831
00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:37.634
And he knew I was worrying about our son

832
00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:39.904
even though we thought he just had a bug.

833
00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:41.851
And I just remember telling him. I'm like.

834
00:39:41.917 --> 00:39:44.224
"Leave. get here now."

835
00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:49.290
And he walked out of work
and just came straight away.

836
00:39:49.634 --> 00:39:51.944
And he said. he knew something was wrong

837
00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:55.334
when a social worker
greeted him at the hospital.

838
00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:58.313
Within two hours. our son
passed away of cardiac arrest.

839
00:40:02.803 --> 00:40:05.970
It was an undiagnosed heart condition.

840
00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:09.994
it's very rare. called Kawasaki disease.

841
00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:13.414
He had gotten sick about
a month and a half before

842
00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:16.054
and turns out that was
the initial symptoms

843
00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:18.753
of the disease expressing
itself in his body.

844
00:40:18.819 --> 00:40:23.819
And the doctors had thought
it was something else.

845
00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:25.334
they thought it was just a virus.

846
00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:26.834
Had it been detected then.

847
00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:28.794
there could have been something that

848
00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:30.814
they could have done. but
the symptoms went away.

849
00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:32.484
he seemed totally fine.

850
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:37.044
And what had happened was the
disease attacks the heart.

851
00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:39.374
And though he gotten a stomach virus.

852
00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:42.654
his heart couldn't handle
the virus going through that.

853
00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:44.794
and his heart gave out.

854
00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:47.544
I like to say that he was just

855
00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:51.664
enveloped in so much love.
his little heart burst.

856
00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:54.504
But there was just this experience

857
00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:57.954
of just watching people come in and out.

858
00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:00.534
I'd say probably 30 people all in all.

859
00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:02.664
entered the room and left the
room trying to revive him.

860
00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:07.730
trying to get him to just stay alive.

861
00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:09.904
What a lot of people don't tell you

862
00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:13.074
is that after a baby dies.

863
00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:15.794
they wrap the baby in a blank
and they hand them to you.

864
00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:20.574
And I think that this is a way
for the parents to transition

865
00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:24.664
into the experience of letting go.

866
00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:27.044
And they give you a
hospital room for four hours

867
00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:28.510
so you can be with the baby.

868
00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:33.052
And I just remember having to call my mom

869
00:41:33.118 --> 00:41:38.118
and I'm feeling that experience.

870
00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:40.744
When I go back and I live the experience.

871
00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:44.464
I get emotional because
it's just like reliving it.

872
00:41:44.530 --> 00:41:48.094
But you should know that
my heart is so full of love

873
00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:51.584
for my son. for the experience.

874
00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:55.834
And for being able to move
through this experience

875
00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:59.173
and be present to what was
enfolding when it was unfolding.

876
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:02.004
I just remember seeing my mom come

877
00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:06.634
and her legs gave out on
her. and my sister was there.

878
00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:09.084
and a few of our friends
came to say goodbye.

879
00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:11.253
And we just kissed him goodbye.

880
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:14.064
We wrapped him in a blanket

881
00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:17.614
that my mother-in-law had made for him.

882
00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:18.704
And they took him away.

883
00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:21.514
We put them in that
because it just felt like.

884
00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:23.574
it looked more like him.

885
00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:28.640
I knew intuitively that it
was time to pay attention.

886
00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.174
I wanted to be present

887
00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:35.094
for what was about to unfold in my life

888
00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:37.124
and our lives collectively.

889
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:41.314
What unfolded in the months following

890
00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:43.984
was this experience in which

891
00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:49.050
I was fully present to
the feelings of loss.

892
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:55.664
the feelings of grief. the
feelings of agony. of sadness.

893
00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:59.124
And instead of trying to push them away

894
00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:01.224
or trying to get through it quickly.

895
00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:04.704
I just allowed them to have residency.

896
00:43:04.770 --> 00:43:06.974
So whatever needed to arise.

897
00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:12.040
I just allowed it to come
up and have its time.

898
00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:17.530
And what I learned in that
was sadness can be beautiful

899
00:43:18.908 --> 00:43:21.204
and it can be healing.

900
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:26.270
and allowing yourself to have
a layered human experience

901
00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:31.564
is so powerful and meaningful.

902
00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:34.874
And because I'm open to it.

903
00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:39.940
I had little miracles that
would unfold along the way.

904
00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:45.734
And now I think the
greatest gift my son gave me

905
00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:49.984
was he walked me over the
bridge from faith to knowing.

906
00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:54.674
So there are certain things
that I now know about life

907
00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:55.634
that I would not

908
00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:59.744
have been able to stand
in authority and say.

909
00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:00.874
I know this to be true.

910
00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:03.034
had that not occurred.

911
00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:05.064
Did it happen the way I wanted it to?

912
00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:07.548
Absolutely not. but it happened.

913
00:44:07.614 --> 00:44:10.531
I remember somebody said to me.

914
00:44:10.597 --> 00:44:13.464
"No parent should go through this."

915
00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:16.644
And I just found that to
be so unhelpful for me.

916
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:19.164
because I was going through this.

917
00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:24.230
And one thing that we must learn to do.

918
00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:28.274
if we are going to experience peace

919
00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:32.243
is accept what is unfolding before us.

920
00:44:33.110 --> 00:44:36.554
- The process is. I
liken it to log rolling.

921
00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:38.164
It's just really hard for us.

922
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:39.864
just falling in the water.
falling in the water.

923
00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:41.374
If the water is your thoughts.

924
00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:44.884
and being on the log is
being in your senses.

925
00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:46.144
you're constantly just falling.

926
00:44:46.210 --> 00:44:48.894
and you have to be totally
okay with that and embrace it.

927
00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:49.884
Why?

928
00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:51.084
Well. first of all. it's a new skill.

929
00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:53.074
you're not supposed to be great at it yet.

930
00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:56.538
But second of all.
it also shows you about
the nature of mind.

931
00:44:56.604 --> 00:44:58.044
Falling into the water

932
00:44:58.110 --> 00:44:59.704
when you're trying to experience a log.

933
00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:00.734
tells you about water.

934
00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.284
and tells you about balance. buoyancy.

935
00:45:02.350 --> 00:45:03.117
all those things.

936
00:45:03.183 --> 00:45:06.179
You're learning things. even
as you "get distracted."

937
00:45:06.245 --> 00:45:08.944
So you're never not benefiting from it.

938
00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:12.341
And you always want to
embrace that experience of.

939
00:45:12.407 --> 00:45:15.928
"Oh this is not simple. and it's not easy.

940
00:45:15.994 --> 00:45:18.784
but each moment I can try again."

941
00:45:18.850 --> 00:45:21.134
And the ability to begin again.

942
00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:23.854
and that spirit of what
we call in neuroscience.

943
00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:26.504
we call it the courage of repetition.

944
00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:31.254
I had to keep embracing
a thousand repetitions

945
00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:33.154
as the yes to the experience.

946
00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:36.200
But also. if you play
a musical instrument.

947
00:45:36.266 --> 00:45:41.164
if you play sports. if you paint or write.

948
00:45:41.230 --> 00:45:44.102
you know what it's like to
not think the technique.

949
00:45:44.168 --> 00:45:47.644
In the beginning. if you're
learning a tennis swing.

950
00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:48.924
the coach is telling you to make sure

951
00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:51.594
to have your racket face
outward a little bit.

952
00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:54.074
and the backswing has to
be parallel to the cord

953
00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:56.461
and your left hand should be
forward if you're right-handed.

954
00:45:56.527 --> 00:45:57.294
"Okay. I gotta to think
about all these things.

955
00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:00.084
And then I try and think
of. and I can't do it."

956
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:02.674
But gradually. I start experimenting.

957
00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:05.334
and my body and my mind are communicating.

958
00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:07.674
and something becomes embodied.

959
00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:08.644
when it's embodied.

960
00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:09.960
I don't need to think it.

961
00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:12.754
I mean. you put on shoes today.

962
00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:13.587
I guarantee you.

963
00:46:13.653 --> 00:46:15.584
you did not think about
how to tie your shoelaces.

964
00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:18.704
You were thinking about
something else. because you can.

965
00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:20.524
because your body knows.

966
00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:24.024
So in the same way. as you practice this

967
00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:25.334
and you begin to distinguish

968
00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:30.234
between thinking breath
versus feeling breath.

969
00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:34.064
thinking wash the dishes versus
actually sensing the plate.

970
00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:36.723
feeling the wet sponge.
hearing the scrub sound.

971
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:39.634
those are all immediate
radical experiences

972
00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:44.642
that don't need explanation
or any kind of elaboration.

973
00:46:44.708 --> 00:46:47.184
But the mind is used to
talking all the time.

974
00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:50.154
and narrating our experience.
which is a wonderful thing.

975
00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:51.284
The only way I can have
this interview with you

976
00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:52.652
is 'cause I can do that.

977
00:46:52.718 --> 00:46:57.360
However. that's not the only
experience that's possible.

978
00:46:57.426 --> 00:47:00.914
And quite often. our internal
narrative is not that pleasant

979
00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:05.004
especially given cultural upheavals

980
00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:08.152
and global health threats
and contentious elections.

981
00:47:08.218 --> 00:47:10.984
So it's helpful to have a choice

982
00:47:11.050 --> 00:47:14.724
to let that sort of
shift to the background.

983
00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:18.024
and that my actual lived
experience being the foreground.

984
00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:21.033
So there's a great payoff
to those thousand reps.

985
00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:27.154
- The journey. there
was an initial benefit

986
00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:29.064
once I started to practice.

987
00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:31.024
of just relief.

988
00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:36.090
relief from my over active.
busy. unable to settle down.

989
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:39.004
easily frustrated mind.

990
00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:42.364
That was great.
And I didn't have to drink any alcohol.

991
00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:44.814
I didn't have to binge on any food.

992
00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:47.891
This was just a skill
and a tool to practice.

993
00:47:47.957 --> 00:47:49.904
And I didn't have to be anywhere

994
00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:51.384
or be with anybody to do it.

995
00:47:51.450 --> 00:47:53.944
That was the initial benefits.

996
00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:59.010
And then about six months into
my practicing mindfulness.

997
00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:01.722
I was in my backyard.

998
00:48:01.788 --> 00:48:03.674
I had just finished yoga.

999
00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:05.904
so I was completely exhausted.

1000
00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:09.434
And then I started my breath practice.

1001
00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:12.954
where I'm bringing my
attention to my breath.

1002
00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:15.244
following it as it's coming in.

1003
00:48:15.310 --> 00:48:17.794
noticing little space in-between.

1004
00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:20.304
and then following my breath as I go out.

1005
00:48:20.370 --> 00:48:23.254
But I also count. so I do a count of five.

1006
00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:27.774
So as I'm breathing in. I do
one. two. three. four. five.

1007
00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:32.054
And as I exhale. I count
one. two. three. four. five.

1008
00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:37.120
it just adds more stimulus or
more information for my brain.

1009
00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.754
my hyperactive brain to focus on.

1010
00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:41.414
But while I was doing that.

1011
00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:45.684
all of a sudden I had this experience

1012
00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:49.054
where my thoughts completely shut off.

1013
00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:52.034
When I also practice
mindfulness. I close my eyes.

1014
00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:53.034
and when I close my eyes.

1015
00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:55.154
I see a little light in front of me.

1016
00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:57.004
And I focus on that light.

1017
00:48:57.070 --> 00:49:00.564
And while I was focusing on
this light in front of me.

1018
00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:03.064
eventually the light kept getting

1019
00:49:03.130 --> 00:49:06.694
bigger and bigger and bigger.

1020
00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:09.133
Eventually. I became the light.

1021
00:49:10.397 --> 00:49:14.614
That saying. I saw the
light. I am the light.

1022
00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:17.894
I felt it flow through me.

1023
00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:21.274
It was an experience that's indescribable.

1024
00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:25.564
I'll do my best. but
just in my descriptions.

1025
00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:27.914
they're just like street
signs. street signs.

1026
00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:29.394
they're not the street.

1027
00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:30.714
While I felt it.

1028
00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:34.282
I felt just pure peace.

1029
00:49:34.348 --> 00:49:39.348
just unbelievable
calmness. peace. and joy.

1030
00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:44.964
and then it stopped.

1031
00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:48.314
And then I was like.
my mind kicked back on.

1032
00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:50.141
My first thought was.

1033
00:49:50.207 --> 00:49:52.504
"Holy shit has just happened."

1034
00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:53.824
because I had been reading

1035
00:49:53.890 --> 00:49:56.604
about this experience
for many. many years.

1036
00:49:56.670 --> 00:49:59.382
The first time I had this experience.

1037
00:49:59.448 --> 00:50:04.448
I was in a car accident
in the summer of '97.

1038
00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:08.284
I was actually ejected out of the vehicle.

1039
00:50:08.350 --> 00:50:10.004
my seatbelt ripped.

1040
00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:13.564
And I was. according to the police report.

1041
00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:16.614
thrown a hundred feet
from the point of impact

1042
00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:19.214
to where my body landed on the ground.

1043
00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:21.154
I don't remember the impact.

1044
00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:22.544
I remember certain points.

1045
00:50:22.610 --> 00:50:24.954
my consciousness just
kept coming in and out.

1046
00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:27.824
And then since we were so
far away from a hospital.

1047
00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:31.754
they send a helicopter out
to lift me air ambulance

1048
00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:34.024
to Holy Cross Medical
Center in Mission Hills.

1049
00:50:34.090 --> 00:50:36.024
I was on the helicopter.

1050
00:50:36.090 --> 00:50:37.274
while I'm on the helicopter.

1051
00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:39.714
my consciousness is coming in and out.

1052
00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:40.682
one moment I'm there.

1053
00:50:40.748 --> 00:50:42.431
everyone's telling me to calm down.

1054
00:50:42.497 --> 00:50:44.064
it was just an accident.

1055
00:50:44.130 --> 00:50:47.858
I'm fighting people because
I'm in such a state of shock.

1056
00:50:47.924 --> 00:50:48.934
I don't know what's going on.

1057
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.464
I get to the hospital.

1058
00:50:50.530 --> 00:50:52.144
they rolled me into the emergency room.

1059
00:50:52.210 --> 00:50:53.324
I'm coming in and out.

1060
00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:54.564
I'm fighting the nurses.

1061
00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:56.544
the nurses are telling me to calm down.

1062
00:50:56.610 --> 00:50:59.374
So while I was in the emergency room.

1063
00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:01.944
and all this chaos was going on.

1064
00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:03.926
and they're sticking a catheter in me

1065
00:51:03.992 --> 00:51:07.144
and breathing tubes down my throat.

1066
00:51:07.210 --> 00:51:12.210
I felt my awareness or my
consciousness leave my body.

1067
00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:17.584
I actually felt like my.

1068
00:51:17.650 --> 00:51:18.832
I don't know

1069
00:51:18.898 --> 00:51:21.037
if you want to call it
spirit awareness conscious.

1070
00:51:21.103 --> 00:51:22.984
whatever you wanna call it.

1071
00:51:23.050 --> 00:51:26.994
actually leave my physical presence.

1072
00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:29.836
And I was able to actually look at myself

1073
00:51:29.902 --> 00:51:32.224
while I was in the room.

1074
00:51:32.290 --> 00:51:34.604
while I was lying down on the hospital.

1075
00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:37.774
while people were frantically
working around me.

1076
00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:39.104
shoving breathing tubes.

1077
00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:41.404
giving me injections. holding me down.

1078
00:51:41.470 --> 00:51:46.440
but I felt completely calm
and peaceful out of my body.

1079
00:51:46.506 --> 00:51:50.994
And I even saw this white light

1080
00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:53.054
out of like the corner of my eye.

1081
00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:54.484
And then when I went towards it.

1082
00:51:54.550 --> 00:51:57.071
then I just kind of blacked out.

1083
00:51:57.137 --> 00:52:00.354
And then I woke up in
ICU three days later.

1084
00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:01.254
and then that's when everybody

1085
00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:02.754
explained to me what happened.

1086
00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:04.894
That was my first experience

1087
00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:07.784
of having. was that near death experience.

1088
00:52:07.850 --> 00:52:10.934
And then about six months
practicing mindfulness.

1089
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.193
I experienced it again.

1090
00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:16.299
And that really

1091
00:52:16.365 --> 00:52:19.063
has completely changed
my life ever since then.

1092
00:52:20.350 --> 00:52:22.054
- Owing back to some of the things

1093
00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:23.624
that we know from science.

1094
00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:24.934
so we know that first of all.

1095
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:29.294
I can take care of this
marvelous. mysterious organism.

1096
00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:33.174
I can learn more about when I'm stressing

1097
00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:34.024
and what to do about it.

1098
00:52:34.090 --> 00:52:35.814
because I'm paying much more attention

1099
00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:37.134
to that throughout the day.

1100
00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:39.309
not just occasionally.
not just on a retreat.

1101
00:52:39.375 --> 00:52:41.285
not just on a spa day.

1102
00:52:41.351 --> 00:52:44.204
but daily. I'm monitoring my body.

1103
00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:47.594
learning how the interaction
with the world creates stress

1104
00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:49.034
and what I can do about it.

1105
00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:51.701
I'm monitoring my mind to see.

1106
00:52:51.767 --> 00:52:54.584
"Oh. where are their thoughts and beliefs.

1107
00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:56.264
that project a reality into the world

1108
00:52:56.330 --> 00:52:58.584
that needs to be verified?"

1109
00:52:58.650 --> 00:53:01.034
So I'm constantly doing fact-checking.

1110
00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:03.484
So I might believe certain things about

1111
00:53:03.550 --> 00:53:05.804
police officers or black lives matter

1112
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:06.774
or whatever it might be.

1113
00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:07.904
How do I know?

1114
00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:09.204
Is that based on one article I read.

1115
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:10.407
one interview I watched?

1116
00:53:10.473 --> 00:53:11.894
I need to really

1117
00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:14.124
start to bring my mindfulness into a place

1118
00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:16.534
where I'm taking on the responsibility

1119
00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:19.474
for verifying what's actual.

1120
00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:21.972
And instead of going into
black and white thinking.

1121
00:53:22.038 --> 00:53:24.334
which just oversimplifies things.

1122
00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:27.774
I have to seek the
gray. if I see the gray.

1123
00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:31.344
it's inconvenient. because
I have to work for it.

1124
00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:33.017
I have to read more articles.

1125
00:53:33.083 --> 00:53:38.083
I have to do that with my
adult discount of discernment.

1126
00:53:38.170 --> 00:53:39.714
I have to talk to people of all kinds

1127
00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:41.024
and disagree with them sometimes.

1128
00:53:41.090 --> 00:53:42.014
How do I do that skillfully?

1129
00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:43.664
Well. that altruism

1130
00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:45.834
that we talked about
mindfulness cultivating.

1131
00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:48.964
which is compassion. curiosity. openness.

1132
00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:51.864
willingness. recognizing our connection.

1133
00:53:51.930 --> 00:53:53.254
not just our differences.

1134
00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:55.194
that will help me have those
difficult conversations

1135
00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:56.854
that can shape culture.

1136
00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:59.734
So mindfulness is the tool.

1137
00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:03.403
the light by which I
could see myself as I am.

1138
00:54:03.469 --> 00:54:05.344
as my body is.

1139
00:54:05.410 --> 00:54:07.004
as my mind functions.

1140
00:54:07.070 --> 00:54:09.684
as my affect animates me.

1141
00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:11.515
and take responsibility for it.

1142
00:54:11.581 --> 00:54:12.994
to try and find out

1143
00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:16.091
what's to the best of
my knowledge today true.

1144
00:54:16.157 --> 00:54:17.474
what is the good in front of me

1145
00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:20.404
that I could do for myself. for others.

1146
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:22.324
And how well am I doing that?

1147
00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:25.933
Mindfulness is the light that
shines on that intention.

1148
00:54:25.999 --> 00:54:28.693
that methodology and those outcomes.

1149
00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:34.194
- It was like a drug when I
didn't achieve it. I was like

1150
00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:35.920
"What the hell am I doing wrong?"

1151
00:54:35.986 --> 00:54:39.254
And I didn't realize like.
"Well. that's not mindfulness."

1152
00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:40.670
Mindfulness is just noticing.

1153
00:54:40.736 --> 00:54:43.710
if that other thing happens. that's great.

1154
00:54:43.776 --> 00:54:48.776
But it's really just noticing
wherever your mind is at.

1155
00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:50.107
The reason why

1156
00:54:50.173 --> 00:54:51.664
you don't wanna set that up as a standard

1157
00:54:51.730 --> 00:54:53.974
is because whenever you don't achieve that

1158
00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:55.880
when you sit down and
meditate or practice.

1159
00:54:55.946 --> 00:54:57.984
then you're gonna get upset.

1160
00:54:58.050 --> 00:54:59.364
Or you're gonna think that

1161
00:54:59.430 --> 00:55:02.754
you're doing it wrong or
incorrectly. and you're not.

1162
00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:04.811
When I have bouts of
hyperactivity. I was like.

1163
00:55:04.877 --> 00:55:06.784
"I'm not doing it right."

1164
00:55:06.850 --> 00:55:09.164
And it's not that I was.
I was doing it right.

1165
00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:13.039
it's just that I had this reference point.

1166
00:55:13.105 --> 00:55:15.474
I was like. "Oh. well. that's
what I want to achieve.

1167
00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:18.704
I'm not calm. or I'm not
having this experience.

1168
00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:20.144
therefore I'm doing it wrong."

1169
00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:21.634
There is no right and wrong.

1170
00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:25.462
That's one of the biggest
misconceptions in mindfulness.

1171
00:55:25.528 --> 00:55:28.584
is that you practice just to practice.

1172
00:55:28.650 --> 00:55:29.944
There's no right way to practice

1173
00:55:30.010 --> 00:55:31.891
or there's no wrong way to practice.

1174
00:55:31.957 --> 00:55:33.564
And that while you're practicing.

1175
00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:36.204
whatever comes up just shows up.

1176
00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:41.004
and you greet it with a
cup of tea and as a friend.

1177
00:55:41.070 --> 00:55:43.803
and with curiosity and investigation.

1178
00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:47.524
- When I teach a group of 25 people

1179
00:55:47.590 --> 00:55:49.353
in one of my UCLA classes.

1180
00:55:49.419 --> 00:55:53.724
I really right away invite skepticism.

1181
00:55:53.790 --> 00:55:56.403
I invite you to challenge me.

1182
00:55:57.286 --> 00:55:59.404
please do it with respect.

1183
00:55:59.470 --> 00:56:01.162
because it's a couple of people

1184
00:56:01.228 --> 00:56:03.984
to have disrespectful conversation.

1185
00:56:04.050 --> 00:56:05.004
But I expect doubt.

1186
00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:06.664
and I expect skepticism.

1187
00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:09.744
don't believe it because
I say it. try it on.

1188
00:56:09.810 --> 00:56:11.774
And so this is where

1189
00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:14.524
we get really interesting
conversations about things.

1190
00:56:14.590 --> 00:56:17.904
Part of the challenge is mindfulness.

1191
00:56:17.970 --> 00:56:21.101
because it has to be in a
marketplace. has to be advertised.

1192
00:56:21.167 --> 00:56:23.804
And in the advertising itself.

1193
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:25.954
it's gonna naturally select some people

1194
00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:29.243
and other people will read it
and say. "That's poppycock."

1195
00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:31.347
That's (indistinct).

1196
00:56:31.413 --> 00:56:32.180
I'm not good at that thing.

1197
00:56:32.246 --> 00:56:34.164
"That's for those kind of people."

1198
00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:35.661
So it doesn't attract

1199
00:56:35.727 --> 00:56:37.494
the people who might be really valuable

1200
00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:39.354
and having a conversation about.

1201
00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:42.414
However. I do have a special population

1202
00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:44.984
for whom I am a mindfulness teacher.

1203
00:56:45.050 --> 00:56:47.164
and that is law enforcement and the FBI.

1204
00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:50.854
There. we have a very.
very skeptical audience.

1205
00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:52.154
And it's very extemporaneous.

1206
00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:54.874
We have a loose outline.
but it's very alive.

1207
00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:56.984
And we invite all the descent.

1208
00:56:57.050 --> 00:56:59.074
And one of the things that
we know about mindfulness.

1209
00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:02.916
which is. again. reflecting
back to my introduction to it.

1210
00:57:02.982 --> 00:57:05.494
you cannot force people into mindfulness

1211
00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:08.636
or demand that they do it.
or even suggest they do it

1212
00:57:08.702 --> 00:57:13.004
without them asking for
something. seeking something.

1213
00:57:13.070 --> 00:57:15.420
And so we had one bad experience

1214
00:57:15.486 --> 00:57:18.111
where Northern California city.

1215
00:57:18.177 --> 00:57:20.631
their chief went through
one of our programs.

1216
00:57:20.697 --> 00:57:22.304
blew his mind open.

1217
00:57:22.370 --> 00:57:24.614
He went to the city. got finances.

1218
00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:25.697
had the entire department

1219
00:57:25.763 --> 00:57:28.694
trained in mindfulness
in our in our program.

1220
00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:30.414
And many of them were resentful.

1221
00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:32.314
because they weren't given a choice.

1222
00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:33.326
And when we found that out.

1223
00:57:33.392 --> 00:57:34.707
no one told us that.

1224
00:57:34.773 --> 00:57:36.891
And they kind of rebelled in the classroom

1225
00:57:36.957 --> 00:57:38.554
during the retreat.

1226
00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:40.581
and we apologized to them and said.

1227
00:57:40.647 --> 00:57:42.334
"It should never be mandatory.

1228
00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:44.679
The beer is stocked.
go have some fun leave.

1229
00:57:44.745 --> 00:57:45.748
If you want to.

1230
00:57:45.814 --> 00:57:49.534
no negative reports to
your superiors. all good."

1231
00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:51.684
And most of them left except for five.

1232
00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:53.500
And those who stayed. we went deep.

1233
00:57:55.251 --> 00:57:56.684
This is really important.

1234
00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:59.274
This is not for everybody at all times.

1235
00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:02.154
This is a voluntary self-introspection.

1236
00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:03.564
And we really respect that.

1237
00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:04.614
We have to respect that.

1238
00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:05.861
And the other thing is that.

1239
00:58:05.927 --> 00:58:08.603
there's always a sense
of self being developed.

1240
00:58:10.278 --> 00:58:11.564
"I've had my first mindfulness class.

1241
00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:13.227
I love mindfulness.

1242
00:58:13.293 --> 00:58:14.060
I want to tell everybody about it."

1243
00:58:14.126 --> 00:58:15.690
And that's natural exuberance.

1244
00:58:15.756 --> 00:58:17.264
You take a few more classes

1245
00:58:17.330 --> 00:58:18.804
and you start to see
your friends struggle.

1246
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:20.174
And maybe you see some struggles

1247
00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:22.174
or here's some struggles
that you went through

1248
00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:24.024
but now you kind of
have a better angle on.

1249
00:58:24.090 --> 00:58:26.982
and now you kind of like.
"Oh. I'm mindful and they're not."

1250
00:58:27.048 --> 00:58:29.504
And so it's very easy to see

1251
00:58:29.570 --> 00:58:32.054
how I can inflate my sense of self.

1252
00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:33.994
which mindfulness is
actually aiming to notice

1253
00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:36.674
that the sense of self is
not what you think it is.

1254
00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:38.587
And certainly. that you're
not better than me people.

1255
00:58:38.653 --> 00:58:40.774
But we can kind of go there.

1256
00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:43.944
I do some mindfulness training
for political activists

1257
00:58:44.010 --> 00:58:45.064
who are canvassing the neighbors.

1258
00:58:45.130 --> 00:58:47.422
trying to get people to sign up and vote.

1259
00:58:47.488 --> 00:58:49.404
I tell them from the very beginning.

1260
00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:54.470
this is a non-sectarian
egalitarian practice.

1261
00:58:54.730 --> 00:58:56.194
And if we're not careful.

1262
00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:58.554
it will be associated
with only being a Democrat

1263
00:58:58.620 --> 00:59:01.163
or being a Liberal. and it's not true.

1264
00:59:02.130 --> 00:59:04.634
You can be a diehard Trump supporter

1265
00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:06.261
and practice mindfulness.

1266
00:59:06.327 --> 00:59:09.284
There might be all kinds of
experiences that you might have

1267
00:59:09.350 --> 00:59:11.474
if you're working earnestly.

1268
00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:16.540
but it's not a club that you
have join with an affiliation.

1269
00:59:16.850 --> 00:59:20.204
it's a human quality of
paying attention. being aware.

1270
00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:23.014
And we all have delusions and illusions

1271
00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:25.330
about the nature of
reality and nature of self.

1272
00:59:25.396 --> 00:59:26.803
No one is free from that.

1273
00:59:28.170 --> 00:59:30.874
- I don't know if mindfulness
is different for me.

1274
00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:35.564
Now. my experience and
introduction of meditation

1275
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:37.064
was through Buddhism.

1276
00:59:37.130 --> 00:59:40.784
and mindfulness grew out
of the Buddhist philosophy.

1277
00:59:40.850 --> 00:59:41.617
that practice.

1278
00:59:41.683 --> 00:59:43.725
and what I became to realize.

1279
00:59:43.791 --> 00:59:47.634
the more my practice
matured was the meditation.

1280
00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:51.144
I practiced was mindfulness meditation.

1281
00:59:51.210 --> 00:59:54.924
which was simply sitting in stillness

1282
00:59:54.990 --> 00:59:57.983
and allowing generally my
breath to be an anchor.

1283
00:59:58.049 --> 01:00:01.734
allowing my attention to
gently fall on my breath.

1284
01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:05.014
and then just being aware of what arose

1285
01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:08.444
during the experience
of sitting in meditation without judgment.

1286
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:10.514
Again. I really have leaned

1287
01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:14.164
into this idea of playful curiosity.

1288
01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:15.314
because I feel like

1289
01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:19.004
that is sort of a wonderful goal to embody

1290
01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:20.363
with anything in life.

1291
01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.834
If you're driving in your car in traffic

1292
01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:26.974
and somebody cuts you off
and you're becoming raged.

1293
01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:31.680
can you playfully be curious
be like. "Why is rage?"

1294
01:00:33.731 --> 01:00:36.144
Do I really feel like that
person isn't valuing me?

1295
01:00:36.210 --> 01:00:38.074
"What's a story I really have here."

1296
01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:40.284
And if we can just be
playful in all of it.

1297
01:00:40.350 --> 01:00:42.794
I really do think that's a key to it.

1298
01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:45.004
Again. if we're not laughing.

1299
01:00:45.070 --> 01:00:46.584
especially at ourselves.

1300
01:00:46.650 --> 01:00:48.624
then I think we're missing a point.

1301
01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:52.219
- In my experience of people
who have taken mindfulness.

1302
01:00:52.285 --> 01:00:54.854
there's usually two effects.

1303
01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:57.034
Daniel Goldman and Richie Davidson

1304
01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:59.604
in the book "Altered Traits"
discuss this beautifully.

1305
01:00:59.670 --> 01:01:02.404
It's the wide narrow path.

1306
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:05.494
And then there's the deep
path that's not so wide.

1307
01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:07.224
What I mean by this is that

1308
01:01:07.290 --> 01:01:09.884
there's a lot of people that
get relaxation out of it.

1309
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:11.884
That's what brought me to it.

1310
01:01:11.950 --> 01:01:13.734
They just get a break from that

1311
01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:17.944
automatic thinking mind
that doesn't shut off.

1312
01:01:18.010 --> 01:01:21.444
We get about 60 to 90.000 thoughts a day.

1313
01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:24.454
and we don't do 60 to 90.000 things a day.

1314
01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:27.224
So it's just our mind constantly going.

1315
01:01:27.290 --> 01:01:30.755
So most people when they first
start practicing mindfulness.

1316
01:01:30.821 --> 01:01:34.274
they report a relief from a break

1317
01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:36.683
from just that mind
that they can't escape.

1318
01:01:38.790 --> 01:01:40.054
And then there's that other paths

1319
01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:41.804
where the people that do have

1320
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:45.574
an actual spiritual
experience practicing it.

1321
01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:47.294
And that's what I experienced.

1322
01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:50.534
It's a switch from. this is something I do

1323
01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:52.684
as something to relax

1324
01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:55.854
to this is now who I am.

1325
01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:59.774
This mindfulness now is just a part of me.

1326
01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:04.097
- I have many teenage clients
in my psychotherapy practice.

1327
01:02:04.163 --> 01:02:07.891
And one of the ways I get
buy-in from them as I ask them.

1328
01:02:07.957 --> 01:02:10.464
"So what's it like kind of
being like forced labor?"

1329
01:02:10.530 --> 01:02:12.604
And they look at me like.
"What are you talking about?"

1330
01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:14.934
And I say. "Well. you kind
of have to go to school.

1331
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.074
it's not your choice.
You don't have a choice about it."

1332
01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:19.149
And quite often.
you don't have a choice
of what school you go.

1333
01:02:19.215 --> 01:02:21.112
And certainly have not a choice
of classes most of the time.

1334
01:02:21.178 --> 01:02:22.854
And you don't have choice to teachers.

1335
01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:24.464
So you're stuck and you have to learn

1336
01:02:24.530 --> 01:02:25.867
and you have to do these things.

1337
01:02:25.933 --> 01:02:28.783
And it results in poor education.

1338
01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:32.573
because you have to
want to learn to learn.

1339
01:02:33.591 --> 01:02:34.644
In the same way.

1340
01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:36.694
mindfulness. you have to be curious

1341
01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:38.684
about the nature of experience.

1342
01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:40.821
Be curious about the nature of your mind.

1343
01:02:40.887 --> 01:02:44.434
be curious about what attention really is.

1344
01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:46.153
and what an emotion really is.

1345
01:02:46.219 --> 01:02:48.324
and whether your thoughts are true.

1346
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:49.684
If you're not curious about that.

1347
01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:50.654
you're not gonna be looking.

1348
01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:52.584
If you're not looking.
you're going to be learning.

1349
01:02:52.650 --> 01:02:53.624
So it's really important

1350
01:02:53.690 --> 01:02:57.305
that we don't insist on
people practicing mindfulness.

1351
01:02:57.371 --> 01:03:01.144
Again. when I reflect
back on my early teachers.

1352
01:03:01.210 --> 01:03:04.024
they never told me to read
a book or try this practice.

1353
01:03:04.090 --> 01:03:07.734
they embodied kindness.
compassion. curiosity.

1354
01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:12.344
temperance. caring. and
that drew me to them.

1355
01:03:12.410 --> 01:03:15.796
So our best example. is if we
can embody those qualities.

1356
01:03:15.862 --> 01:03:18.812
People who benefit from them might say.

1357
01:03:18.878 --> 01:03:20.124
"you've really changed

1358
01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:22.264
or what's your deal. what's your secret?"

1359
01:03:22.330 --> 01:03:23.814
And you might share it at that point

1360
01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:25.544
and maybe they're interested.
maybe they're not.

1361
01:03:25.610 --> 01:03:26.377
But it's really important

1362
01:03:26.443 --> 01:03:28.854
to respect the individual's
sense of agency

1363
01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:30.624
and where they are in their lives.

1364
01:03:30.690 --> 01:03:32.784
It's not for everyone all the time.

1365
01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:36.034
- What's really enjoyable
about teaching mindfulness

1366
01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:39.344
is just the connection with others.

1367
01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:41.894
I noticed that when people discover it.

1368
01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:44.644
the ones that are really open to it.

1369
01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:46.944
it really changes their life.

1370
01:03:47.010 --> 01:03:48.584
just how it changed my life.

1371
01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:52.294
They really go through a transformation.

1372
01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:53.974
a mental transformation.

1373
01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:56.894
whereas before they were really suffering

1374
01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:59.288
with their mind that was uncontrolled.

1375
01:03:59.354 --> 01:04:01.804
that the negativity bias

1376
01:04:01.870 --> 01:04:03.811
and all those automatic negative thoughts

1377
01:04:03.877 --> 01:04:06.072
were really running their life.

1378
01:04:06.138 --> 01:04:11.138
And once they get a break.
they're just so happy.

1379
01:04:11.830 --> 01:04:16.830
And also just being able to
offer a class or a safe space

1380
01:04:18.622 --> 01:04:22.184
where people can come
to and just talk about

1381
01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:23.744
what they're going through.

1382
01:04:23.810 --> 01:04:26.341
what they're experiencing
in their practice

1383
01:04:26.407 --> 01:04:27.944
and in their life.

1384
01:04:28.010 --> 01:04:29.475
To me. my practice in my life.

1385
01:04:29.541 --> 01:04:30.934
they're kind of the same.

1386
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.384
I have my formal practice and my informal.

1387
01:04:33.450 --> 01:04:36.728
My formal is when I just
sit and don't do anything.

1388
01:04:36.794 --> 01:04:38.654
but then I have my informal practice.

1389
01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:40.744
So as I'm having conversations.

1390
01:04:40.810 --> 01:04:44.051
the moment the conversation turns to.

1391
01:04:44.117 --> 01:04:47.014
"Oh. now I'm not having a conversation.

1392
01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:48.757
now I'm having a debate.

1393
01:04:48.823 --> 01:04:51.744
and now I'm not listening to the person.

1394
01:04:51.810 --> 01:04:56.752
Now I'm just trying to get
the person to agree with me."

1395
01:04:56.818 --> 01:04:59.894
so I practice it in my conversations.

1396
01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:00.784
Throughout the day.

1397
01:05:00.850 --> 01:05:03.774
people report how it helps them.

1398
01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:05.374
now just eating meals.

1399
01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:08.431
So now as they eat their
lunch or their dinner.

1400
01:05:08.497 --> 01:05:12.148
they're able to be really
fully with the meal

1401
01:05:12.214 --> 01:05:14.404
rather than thinking about.

1402
01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:16.696
so if they're having their lunch.

1403
01:05:16.762 --> 01:05:19.564
they're not busy thinking
about what's for dinner.

1404
01:05:19.630 --> 01:05:21.434
So people are reporting

1405
01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:24.663
just more moments of
satisfaction throughout the day.

1406
01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:28.504
- I teach mindfulness.

1407
01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:32.474
and how I encourage people to
use a mindfulness practice.

1408
01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:34.780
is to be able to create space

1409
01:05:34.846 --> 01:05:37.814
from that which we
identify as the observer

1410
01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:41.934
and the endless ticker of
thoughts that are going nonstop.

1411
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.854
So you can be able to
separate yourself from them.

1412
01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:47.664
see that. "Oh. I am not my thoughts."

1413
01:05:47.730 --> 01:05:50.044
And just because. like
I mentioned earlier.

1414
01:05:50.110 --> 01:05:52.854
because I'm thinking it.
doesn't mean that it's true.

1415
01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:56.561
and I can see it arise again
and again and again and again

1416
01:05:56.627 --> 01:05:58.994
and I don't have to attach myself to it.

1417
01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:04.060
And that's a skill that is
learned. and it takes practice.

1418
01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:08.784
And so meditation is the most tangible

1419
01:06:08.850 --> 01:06:10.934
practice you can do to support yourself

1420
01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.084
in developing that kind of awareness.

1421
01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:16.354
- Shortly after I was meditating

1422
01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:19.612
or practicing mindfulness
during one of my sessions.

1423
01:06:19.678 --> 01:06:23.634
I just thought of how good I was feeling.

1424
01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:27.704
then I started to think
about how limited I am

1425
01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:30.584
as far as work capacity
with my chronic pain

1426
01:06:30.650 --> 01:06:32.204
and with my vision.

1427
01:06:32.270 --> 01:06:34.624
It's hard for me to just
go to a 9:00 to 5:00

1428
01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:35.684
and sit at a desk.

1429
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:37.184
I can do it with my vision.

1430
01:06:37.250 --> 01:06:39.644
but factoring in the pain and the vision

1431
01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:41.824
make it very difficult.

1432
01:06:41.890 --> 01:06:44.378
So I was feeling really good.

1433
01:06:44.444 --> 01:06:49.444
And I thought. "I can teach mindfulness."

1434
01:06:50.010 --> 01:06:53.244
It took me six months
to work up the courage

1435
01:06:53.310 --> 01:06:56.864
to even offer the class
at the Braille Institute.

1436
01:06:56.930 --> 01:07:01.064
because of just of my past
trauma of being bullied.

1437
01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:03.654
So just offering the mindfulness class.

1438
01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:06.734
that was challenging for me and stressful.

1439
01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:10.744
And that's part of the PTSD
as far as me overcoming it.

1440
01:07:10.810 --> 01:07:15.624
And now I can do it. no problem.
as far as going to class.

1441
01:07:15.690 --> 01:07:18.802
And at first. the whole week.

1442
01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:22.204
the very first class I offered.

1443
01:07:22.270 --> 01:07:24.274
that whole week I was anxious.

1444
01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:27.371
Then I started to work on it.

1445
01:07:27.437 --> 01:07:29.724
And the more often I taught class.

1446
01:07:29.790 --> 01:07:31.374
the more comfortable I became.

1447
01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:33.434
they call it exposure therapy.

1448
01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:36.826
I was exposing myself
to unpleasant stimulus.

1449
01:07:36.892 --> 01:07:40.116
and I was becoming comfortable with it.

1450
01:07:40.182 --> 01:07:44.504
so that I no longer experience
that stress response.

1451
01:07:44.570 --> 01:07:46.024
And now I can have class

1452
01:07:46.090 --> 01:07:47.844
at the Braille Institute. no problems.

1453
01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:52.910
Just seeing the benefits and
the effects it's had on me.

1454
01:07:53.144 --> 01:07:55.757
I wanna share that with others.

1455
01:07:55.823 --> 01:07:59.211
I want others to overcome
their difficulties.

1456
01:07:59.277 --> 01:08:02.424
their challenges. their struggles.

1457
01:08:02.490 --> 01:08:04.444
For me. it's public speaking.

1458
01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:09.118
or going in unfamiliar
situations or settings

1459
01:08:09.184 --> 01:08:12.380
or maybe having certain
conversations with people.

1460
01:08:12.446 --> 01:08:15.293
but it's a work in progress.

1461
01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:20.534
- So owing to just the
way information shared.

1462
01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:22.674
and there's no way to get around this.

1463
01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:26.271
whether it's a flyer.
a website. a workshop.

1464
01:08:26.337 --> 01:08:29.234
a book. a podcast.

1465
01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:33.693
we convey mindfulness when
we're not face-to-face

1466
01:08:33.759 --> 01:08:35.877
through words and concepts.

1467
01:08:35.943 --> 01:08:38.994
and it's in language. cultural language.

1468
01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:40.824
And that means inherently.

1469
01:08:40.890 --> 01:08:42.714
we have all kinds of misconceptions.

1470
01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:46.264
So if you look at the last
couple of Time Magazine covers.

1471
01:08:46.330 --> 01:08:49.714
it's usually a white woman. gorgeous.

1472
01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:52.964
sitting in a lotus position
with her hands like this.

1473
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:55.884
And the messaging that's unconscious is.

1474
01:08:55.950 --> 01:08:57.249
this is for white people.

1475
01:08:57.315 --> 01:08:59.427
this is for upper-class people.

1476
01:08:59.493 --> 01:09:01.514
this is for beautiful people.

1477
01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:03.674
This is going to make
you serene and peaceful.

1478
01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:06.344
And the person you always
wanted to be around your kids

1479
01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:08.354
or the person you always wanted to be

1480
01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:12.198
to make your friend's husband
jealous or whatever it is.

1481
01:09:12.264 --> 01:09:16.194
And so we have a lot of
misconceptions about it.

1482
01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:18.104
If it's taught well.

1483
01:09:18.170 --> 01:09:19.745
what we start to see is that.

1484
01:09:19.811 --> 01:09:21.664
although the relaxation piece

1485
01:09:21.730 --> 01:09:25.115
is really tangible and
immediately available.

1486
01:09:25.181 --> 01:09:28.874
and the fascination with this discussion

1487
01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:31.704
of what's happening in the world.

1488
01:09:31.770 --> 01:09:32.694
what's happening with this person

1489
01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:34.684
or what's happening with the
psychology of that person.

1490
01:09:34.750 --> 01:09:37.634
but like. "Oh. what's
the mechanism of being".

1491
01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:40.004
thinking. feeling. sensing?

1492
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:41.104
Oh. there's something there to learn.

1493
01:09:41.170 --> 01:09:41.964
That's kind of amazing.

1494
01:09:42.030 --> 01:09:44.354
'cause that can be kind
of exciting right away.

1495
01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:47.564
But one of the early
misconceptions is that

1496
01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:50.155
it's gonna be really
blissful and wonderful.

1497
01:09:50.221 --> 01:09:53.294
and it can be like that quite often.

1498
01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:56.304
And it also can be really
painful. really difficult.

1499
01:09:56.370 --> 01:09:58.064
When I discovered that
I had some prejudice.

1500
01:09:58.130 --> 01:09:59.893
I have some racial prejudice on that roof.

1501
01:09:59.959 --> 01:10:03.974
I saw aspects of my functioning.
they're not flattering.

1502
01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:07.784
And so mindfulness is
about trying to be as real

1503
01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:09.424
and true as possible.

1504
01:10:09.490 --> 01:10:10.974
And that can be uncomfortable.

1505
01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:13.153
- 'Cause mindfulness is not enough.

1506
01:10:15.624 --> 01:10:19.020
A lot of people put
too much on mindfulness

1507
01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:22.184
and then they become disappointed

1508
01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:25.614
because it doesn't give
them all the things

1509
01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:27.280
they thought is gonna give them.

1510
01:10:28.139 --> 01:10:31.924
And limited by calling it a tool.

1511
01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:34.704
calling it a practice.

1512
01:10:34.770 --> 01:10:35.884
- There's also some misconceptions

1513
01:10:35.950 --> 01:10:40.604
about having to be a good meditator.

1514
01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:42.421
So one of my first lectures was.

1515
01:10:42.487 --> 01:10:46.014
"Meditation is for noisy
minds and it was overwhelming."

1516
01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:47.794
I had to find a new
venue to make it bigger.

1517
01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:49.464
because everyone knows what that's like.

1518
01:10:49.530 --> 01:10:51.554
I can't stop my mind.
I can't stop thinking.

1519
01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:52.387
"I can't meditate."

1520
01:10:52.453 --> 01:10:54.234
That's a huge misconception.

1521
01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:55.424
Here's the good news.

1522
01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:58.406
you don't need to stop your
mind from talking. thinking.

1523
01:10:58.472 --> 01:11:02.614
you just need to try and develop
a stable enough attention

1524
01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:04.644
to it letting your body sensations.

1525
01:11:04.710 --> 01:11:06.882
and just let that thinking go.

1526
01:11:06.948 --> 01:11:09.093
The analogy I like about this is

1527
01:11:09.159 --> 01:11:11.994
the body is more stable like a riverbank.

1528
01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:13.044
it's not moving very much.

1529
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:14.954
it's just right there.
and you can sit on it.

1530
01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:17.889
you can be in it.
And the river is your thoughts.

1531
01:11:17.955 --> 01:11:19.904
So the river of thoughts.
I'm not trying to.

1532
01:11:19.970 --> 01:11:21.264
when I'm practicing mindfulness.

1533
01:11:21.330 --> 01:11:23.574
dam up that river. dry
it out. gouge it out.

1534
01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:25.274
fill it and stop it anyway.

1535
01:11:25.340 --> 01:11:27.604
I'm letting the river
of thoughts just flow.

1536
01:11:27.670 --> 01:11:30.174
So a misconception about
having to stop your thoughts.

1537
01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.534
prevent so many people
from trying to practice.

1538
01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:34.994
but instead. let those thoughts go.

1539
01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:36.764
and just keep coming back to the riverbank

1540
01:11:36.830 --> 01:11:38.964
and resting in the stillness.

1541
01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:42.054
And soon. you'll find
yourself there more and more.

1542
01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:43.264
and able to watch the river

1543
01:11:43.330 --> 01:11:45.974
and know what the rumor is about.

1544
01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:51.040
- One of the biggest
misconceptions. and even I had.

1545
01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:56.520
was that I was going to magically achieve

1546
01:11:57.190 --> 01:12:02.190
this lightened. awakened.
realized present state.

1547
01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:07.624
and that it was just gonna last.

1548
01:12:07.690 --> 01:12:09.103
that I was just gonna stay there

1549
01:12:09.169 --> 01:12:12.861
and all my suffering was gonna go away

1550
01:12:12.927 --> 01:12:17.541
and everything was just gonna
be beautiful afterwards.

1551
01:12:17.607 --> 01:12:20.574
And that hasn't been my experience.

1552
01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:25.640
Now. there are moments where I
may experience peace and joy.

1553
01:12:26.083 --> 01:12:28.354
but it's a process.

1554
01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:30.484
just that desire

1555
01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:33.304
to completely get rid
of all of my suffering.

1556
01:12:33.370 --> 01:12:37.797
So like my symptoms. I experience
as far as irritability.

1557
01:12:37.863 --> 01:12:40.438
frustration. nervousness.

1558
01:12:40.504 --> 01:12:44.144
my desire to completely
get rid of those things

1559
01:12:44.210 --> 01:12:46.214
cause more suffering.

1560
01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:48.494
because whenever they would happen.

1561
01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:50.760
I'd be like. "This isn't
supposed to happen."

1562
01:12:51.616 --> 01:12:53.664
I'm not there yet.

1563
01:12:53.730 --> 01:12:55.824
I haven't practiced enough yet

1564
01:12:55.890 --> 01:12:58.114
"or I'm not enlightened enough yet."

1565
01:12:58.180 --> 01:12:59.294
That's not it at all.

1566
01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:03.184
It helps me manage my symptoms better

1567
01:13:03.250 --> 01:13:04.654
when they are triggered.

1568
01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:06.684
They don't get rid of them. no.

1569
01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:09.154
it has help me have less of them.

1570
01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:11.344
And then when I do experience them.

1571
01:13:11.410 --> 01:13:15.373
I manage them more effectively.
but get rid of them. no.

1572
01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:17.934
- We're at entry stage right now

1573
01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.160
where it's become so popular

1574
01:13:19.226 --> 01:13:20.474
that many people

1575
01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:24.274
want to very earnestly
teach and show others.

1576
01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:26.662
because they've had some
profound experiences.

1577
01:13:26.728 --> 01:13:28.594
And at UCLA.

1578
01:13:28.660 --> 01:13:32.121
we've really recognized that
there's a need for the consumer

1579
01:13:32.187 --> 01:13:34.111
to have some way of knowing.

1580
01:13:34.177 --> 01:13:36.474
"How do I know what a good
mindfulness teacher is?"

1581
01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:37.554
I don't know I think about this stuff.

1582
01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:39.688
I don't know how to trust somebody.

1583
01:13:39.754 --> 01:13:41.324
they seem good.

1584
01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:44.164
I like them. is all that is required.

1585
01:13:44.230 --> 01:13:45.031
And so we have the

1586
01:13:45.097 --> 01:13:48.264
International Mindfulness
Teachers Association that's formed

1587
01:13:48.330 --> 01:13:52.154
to help certify certification schools.

1588
01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:53.594
So our school is one.

1589
01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:58.660
the University of California
at San Diego. UCSD is one.

1590
01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:01.644
There are many of them.
many programs that certify teachers.

1591
01:14:01.710 --> 01:14:03.674
and we're making this
big grassroots effort

1592
01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:05.554
to get them all under one umbrella.

1593
01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:08.257
to have certain standards that
we can send to the public.

1594
01:14:08.323 --> 01:14:10.414
this person or this organization

1595
01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:12.474
has met minimum competency standards.

1596
01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:14.215
so that we can keep you safe.

1597
01:14:14.281 --> 01:14:18.607
In general. most of the
mindfulness teachers.

1598
01:14:18.673 --> 01:14:21.074
we think of like Jack Kornfield

1599
01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:25.036
or Sam Harris or Joseph Goldstein.

1600
01:14:25.102 --> 01:14:26.636
there are a number of people out there.

1601
01:14:26.702 --> 01:14:28.684
have really public faces.

1602
01:14:28.750 --> 01:14:30.494
and they're very. very much transparent

1603
01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:33.954
about their practice.
their learning communities.

1604
01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:36.484
And so that transparency helps.

1605
01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:37.894
They're part of a teacher's council.

1606
01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:39.834
so they have checks and balances.

1607
01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:41.464
So one of the things we
wanna look for in a teacher

1608
01:14:41.530 --> 01:14:43.714
is that they're not
teaching alone in isolation.

1609
01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:45.794
because then there's no oversight.

1610
01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:48.744
Then there's a chance to step into areas

1611
01:14:48.810 --> 01:14:52.104
where they don't have
competency or potentially abuse

1612
01:14:52.170 --> 01:14:52.984
in terms of students

1613
01:14:53.050 --> 01:14:55.684
who are putting them on a pedestal

1614
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:57.944
and giving them too much power.

1615
01:14:58.010 --> 01:15:00.384
So I think it's most important.

1616
01:15:00.450 --> 01:15:02.742
There haven't been any. to my knowledge.

1617
01:15:02.808 --> 01:15:05.134
secular mindfulness teacher scandals.

1618
01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.374
but there have been a lot of
Buddhist teacher scandals.

1619
01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:08.788
again. for this very reason.

1620
01:15:08.854 --> 01:15:10.476
that they haven't maintained

1621
01:15:10.542 --> 01:15:15.234
a council of eyes watching
over them and transparency.

1622
01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:16.780
And that's really the core.

1623
01:15:16.846 --> 01:15:19.614
is to have a kind of transparency

1624
01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:22.874
where a community is participating

1625
01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:25.234
in maintaining the
integrity of the teacher

1626
01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:26.604
so that there's no tendency

1627
01:15:26.670 --> 01:15:29.104
for some shadow side of a personality

1628
01:15:29.170 --> 01:15:31.674
to come out and take advantage of people.

1629
01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:33.174
- The number one thing

1630
01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:35.934
about first getting into mindfulness

1631
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:41.000
is finding a teacher that you
really feel comfortable with

1632
01:15:41.207 --> 01:15:43.314
and that speaks to you.

1633
01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:44.957
One person's experience

1634
01:15:45.023 --> 01:15:48.554
might not resonate with your experience.

1635
01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:50.241
I don't want people to say like.

1636
01:15:50.307 --> 01:15:53.054
"Well. that means
mindfulness isn't for me."

1637
01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:54.914
I made that mistake in a yoga class.

1638
01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:57.804
I didn't really gel
with the yoga instructor

1639
01:15:57.870 --> 01:15:59.457
or I didn't really like their techniques.

1640
01:15:59.523 --> 01:16:02.669
And I just completely gave
up on yoga for a while.

1641
01:16:02.735 --> 01:16:07.114
The key is to really find a
teacher that you connect with.

1642
01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:09.214
I think that is the most important thing.

1643
01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:13.689
and that can be done
either in person or online

1644
01:16:13.755 --> 01:16:18.144
for people who can't afford
mindfulness on YouTube now.

1645
01:16:18.210 --> 01:16:20.447
- There's a lot of different
teachers that are offering.

1646
01:16:20.513 --> 01:16:23.984
posting their guided meditations online.

1647
01:16:24.050 --> 01:16:25.880
Or there are some teachers

1648
01:16:25.946 --> 01:16:28.744
that even offer classes online.

1649
01:16:28.810 --> 01:16:30.774
Once you find a teacher.

1650
01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:34.184
deciding to do it in-person
if that's an option.

1651
01:16:34.250 --> 01:16:37.594
and if that's not an option.
then to do it online.

1652
01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:40.224
I suggest to do it in-person 'cause just.

1653
01:16:40.290 --> 01:16:43.372
coming together and meeting and sharing

1654
01:16:43.438 --> 01:16:48.438
has a certain sacred feeling. connection

1655
01:16:49.810 --> 01:16:54.423
that I receive than just online.

1656
01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:57.544
- I love talking about this stuff.

1657
01:16:57.610 --> 01:17:00.734
I think I remain curious
about the thoughts I think

1658
01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:04.204
and how it paints the
landscape of my life today.

1659
01:17:04.270 --> 01:17:08.054
I think that my enthusiasm
supports my students

1660
01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:11.884
and other people and booing
themselves through the process

1661
01:17:11.950 --> 01:17:14.674
of developing something
that works for them.

1662
01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:19.740
And this is why I really
value spiritual community.

1663
01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:24.444
Having people that are
walking the path with you.

1664
01:17:24.510 --> 01:17:27.164
that are practicing the
same things you are doing.

1665
01:17:27.230 --> 01:17:27.997
that aren't gonna tell you

1666
01:17:28.063 --> 01:17:30.604
that it's stupid or crazy
or weird or whatever.

1667
01:17:30.670 --> 01:17:32.198
And I always say like.

1668
01:17:32.264 --> 01:17:34.382
don't tell other people what you're doing.

1669
01:17:34.448 --> 01:17:37.124
leave it for other people
that are also doing it.

1670
01:17:37.190 --> 01:17:38.614
so you don't have to get those seeds

1671
01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:41.974
of doubt or worry or shame in your mind.

1672
01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:44.824
The ability to give zero facts

1673
01:17:44.890 --> 01:17:46.204
about what other people think

1674
01:17:46.270 --> 01:17:50.284
is truly a state of a masterful practice.

1675
01:17:50.350 --> 01:17:52.740
because worrying about
what other people think

1676
01:17:52.806 --> 01:17:56.834
has killed more dreams than anything else

1677
01:17:56.900 --> 01:17:58.934
I've come in contact with

1678
01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.176
as a counselor. coach. spiritual teacher.

1679
01:18:02.242 --> 01:18:06.518
Really becoming aware of
the thoughts you're thinking

1680
01:18:06.584 --> 01:18:08.594
and that they don't have to be true.

1681
01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:11.618
that you can question them
and that you can replace them.

1682
01:18:11.684 --> 01:18:15.144
that is the biggest aha moment

1683
01:18:15.210 --> 01:18:17.884
for most of the people
that I've worked with.

1684
01:18:17.950 --> 01:18:21.626
The understanding that
they can change their story

1685
01:18:21.692 --> 01:18:24.184
and they can release the past.

1686
01:18:24.250 --> 01:18:28.725
that they don't have to be
victims of the narrative

1687
01:18:28.791 --> 01:18:33.484
or the inheritance of their
family. that's freedom.

1688
01:18:33.550 --> 01:18:35.934
It's liberating to know that

1689
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.184
you get to choose the
life you'd like to live.

1690
01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:43.854
- You become aware of not
just your cluttered mind.

1691
01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:47.034
but your way of behaving.

1692
01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:50.474
'cause we're constantly leaving an imprint

1693
01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:53.914
with our movement. with our actions

1694
01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:55.241
whether we want it or not.

1695
01:18:55.307 --> 01:18:58.134
And that imprint is not separate from us.

1696
01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:02.624
We are connected to the
imprint. we benefit from it.

1697
01:19:02.690 --> 01:19:06.147
So if it's even for the
selfish personal reason.

1698
01:19:06.213 --> 01:19:07.714
you wanna look and see.

1699
01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:10.321
what am I doing that's causing me

1700
01:19:10.387 --> 01:19:15.274
to be unhappy at the end
of the day. unfulfilled.

1701
01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:18.774
- This is what I've been
looking for my whole life.

1702
01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:21.834
I found it going inside.

1703
01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:24.294
I didn't find it going outside of myself.

1704
01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:26.737
I didn't find it getting a certain job

1705
01:19:26.803 --> 01:19:31.496
or going to school or
accomplishing something.

1706
01:19:31.562 --> 01:19:35.840
I found it just in the
backyard after a yoga session.

1707
01:19:35.906 --> 01:19:37.914
and following my breath.

1708
01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:40.654
And it was just very profound.

1709
01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:45.503
Now that I'm able to
access that peaceful state.

1710
01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:49.281
that state of calmness.

1711
01:19:49.347 --> 01:19:52.124
I really wanna sh.

1712
01:19:52.190 --> 01:19:55.144
it's no good me keeping it to myself.

1713
01:19:55.210 --> 01:19:56.864
because I'm surrounded by others.

1714
01:19:56.930 --> 01:19:59.264
and I see a lot of suffering in the world.

1715
01:19:59.330 --> 01:20:04.034
One of my favorite gurus is Ram Dass.

1716
01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:05.623
who just recently passed away.

1717
01:20:06.610 --> 01:20:08.504
And I've read several of his books.

1718
01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:12.924
And one of his favorite sayings he has

1719
01:20:12.990 --> 01:20:15.871
or my favorite saying is that.

1720
01:20:15.937 --> 01:20:19.054
"The best way to solve any problem

1721
01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:21.994
is with a quiet mind and an open heart."

1722
01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:27.060
So my practice now is quieting
my mind and opening my heart.

1723
01:20:42.078 --> 01:20:44.911
(energetic music)
