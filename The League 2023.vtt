<i>I played
with a very good friend of mine.</i>

4
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.944
<i>He and I used to pretend
like we were playing</i>

5
00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.556
<i>against eight other guys
and we played with anything</i>

6
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.819
<i>that we could to pretend
like it was a baseball</i>

7
00:00:36.993 --> 00:00:38.342
<i>and we used broomsticks.</i>

8
00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:41.693
<i>I don't know
that you would call it baseball.</i>

9
00:00:41.867 --> 00:00:44.044
<i>But we did
the best we could.</i>

10
00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:51.007
<i>A baseball is round.
the bat's the same. you know?</i>

11
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.270
<i>If you have talent.
no matter what color you are.</i>

12
00:00:53.444 --> 00:00:55.229
<i>and if you can play.
you can play.</i>

13
00:00:57.144 --> 00:00:59.885
<i>Baseball is the greatest game
that's ever been invented.</i>

14
00:01:02.932 --> 00:01:04.151
<i>I think
there's always been</i>

15
00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:06.022
<i>in African American life</i>

16
00:01:06.196 --> 00:01:10.113
<i>a real appreciation
of improvisation.</i>

17
00:01:11.158 --> 00:01:14.465
<i>You figured out other ways
of being able to succeed.</i>

18
00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:19.470
<i>And a perfect example of that
is what they did with baseball.</i>

19
00:01:20.645 --> 00:01:22.778
<i>And that's the story
really of the Negro Leagues.</i>

20
00:01:42.667 --> 00:01:44.191
"Prince" Joe: <i>I hear
Black people talking</i>

21
00:01:44.365 --> 00:01:45.975
<i>about church.
I talk about the Negro Leagues.</i>

22
00:01:46.454 --> 00:01:49.370
<i>So much depth.
You had all kind of stars.</i>

23
00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.763
<i>There was a camaraderie. man.</i>

24
00:01:52.547 --> 00:01:54.592
<i>You finished playing
a baseball game?</i>

25
00:01:55.027 --> 00:01:57.334
<i>And. man. you go
to the nice places</i>

26
00:01:57.508 --> 00:01:58.988
<i>within the Black community.</i>

27
00:01:59.206 --> 00:02:00.946
<i>and all of your people
were there.</i>

28

<i>They're so loving. you know?</i>

29
00:02:03.732 --> 00:02:04.733
<i>Greatest thing
that ever happened</i>

30
00:02:04.907 --> 00:02:05.821
<i>to me in my life.</i>

31
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.173
<i>Negroes didn't play ball
'cause they were making money.</i>

32
00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.742
<i>They played the ballgame
because they loved to play it.</i>

33
00:02:17.441 --> 00:02:19.400
<i>The Negro Leagues.
I think is a story</i>

34
00:02:19.574 --> 00:02:23.969
<i>about what Black Americans
were able to achieve</i>

35
00:02:24.231 --> 00:02:26.842
at a time when they only had
themselves to rely on.

36
00:02:27.451 --> 00:02:29.845
<i>They are a proud
bunch of men</i>

37
00:02:30.237 --> 00:02:32.500
<i>who play
between the white foul lines.</i>

38
00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:36.156
<i>They accepted their role
as a part of a movement</i>

39
00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.028
before we coined the term
"Civil Rights Movement."

Bob K: <i>To go
to a Negro Leagues game.</i>

41
00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:44.381

42
00:02:45.208 --> 00:02:47.863

<i>known as the Negro Leagues.</i>

44
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.563
<i>To a large degree

<i>that it was something

46
00:02:56.263 --> 00:02:58.134
Now. it was shared
with the rest of the world.

47
00:02:58.787 --> 00:03:00.136

48
00:03:00.441 --> 00:03:01.964

85
00:05:00.648 --> 00:05:04.782
So there were African American
professional ballplayers

86
00:05:04.956 --> 00:05:07.045
in the 19th century.

87
00:05:08.133 --> 00:05:10.135
<i>African Americans
have been playing baseball</i>

88
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.617
<i>for as long as White people
have been playing baseball.</i>

89
00:05:14.488 --> 00:05:17.882
As the sport began
to take hold in popularity.

90
00:05:18.056 --> 00:05:21.756
post-Civil War.
Black people were there always.

91
00:05:22.887 --> 00:05:24.585
<i>There were organized
Black teams.</i>

92
00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:26.238
<i>and they barnstormed.</i>

93
00:05:26.413 --> 00:05:27.936
<i>They played
against other Black teams.</i>

94
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.025
<i>They played against White teams.</i>

95
00:05:30.808 --> 00:05:33.507
<i>There were Blacks
who did play</i>

96
00:05:34.072 --> 00:05:38.033
<i>with Whites on teams.
But the team was majority White.</i>

97
00:05:38.207 --> 00:05:40.296
<i>it may have one
or two Black players on it</i>

98
00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:42.994
<i>and that seemed to be something
that was more acceptable</i>

99
00:05:43.168 --> 00:05:44.953
<i>to the White paying public.</i>

100
00:05:45.257 --> 00:05:46.911
<i>If they only have one
or two Black players</i>

101
00:05:47.085 --> 00:05:48.304
as opposed to a team

102
00:05:48.478 --> 00:05:50.001
that might have
majority Black players

103
00:05:50.175 --> 00:05:51.307
and one or two White players.

104
00:05:53.396 --> 00:05:56.094
<i>But as we move forward
through history.</i>

105
00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:59.968
<i>we see that segregation
starts to tighten its hold.</i>

106
00:06:01.926 --> 00:06:03.711
<i>In 1887.</i>

107
00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:06.714
<i>the character named
Adrian "Cap" Anson</i>

00:06:06.888 --> 00:06:08.455
<i>who's up in the Hall of Fame
right now.</i>

109
00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:10.718
<i>one of the fathers
of professional baseball.</i>

110

<i>is scheduled to play in Newark</i>

111
00:06:13.155 --> 00:06:14.765
against
the Newark Little Giants.

112
00:06:15.026 --> 00:06:16.245
Anson is a racist.

113
00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:17.942
There's no question
he's a racist

114
00:06:18.334 --> 00:06:20.380
<i>because two Black players.</i>

115
00:06:20.554 --> 00:06:22.817
<i>one of them named George Stovey.
a pitcher.</i>

116
00:06:22.991 --> 00:06:25.254
<i>and the other
Moses Fleetwood Walker.</i>

117
00:06:26.255 --> 00:06:27.909
Anson sends word ahead.

118
00:06:28.083 --> 00:06:30.433
"If those two so-and-so's..."

119
00:06:30.651 --> 00:06:33.436
and he uses a word stronger
than "so-and-so's."

120
00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:35.960
"...are seen on
the field of play.

121
00:06:36.744 --> 00:06:38.354
my team is not gonna play."

122
00:06:41.183 --> 00:06:43.577
<i>Cap Anson. at the time.
is really popular.</i>

123
00:06:43.751 --> 00:06:47.058
<i>and the idea that Cap Anson
could potentially represent</i>

124
00:06:47.232 --> 00:06:50.018
<i>the beliefs and ideals
of White people</i>

125
00:06:50.192 --> 00:06:53.064
<i>throughout baseball.
throughout America in general.</i>

126
00:06:53.369 --> 00:06:54.631
<i>is something
that these executives</i>

127
00:06:54.805 --> 00:06:56.024
<i>really pay attention to.</i>

128
00:06:56.198 --> 00:06:58.374
So when he says
that he's not willing

129
00:06:58.548 --> 00:07:00.245
to take the field
with Black players.

130
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.421
they're like. "Okay."

131
00:07:02.204 --> 00:07:03.945
<i>The International
League directors</i>

132
00:07:04.119 --> 00:07:06.513
<i>held a secret meeting
at the Genesee House yesterday.</i>

133
00:07:06.687 --> 00:07:08.036
<i>and the question
of Colored players</i>

134
00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:09.472
<i>was freely discussed.</i>

135
00:07:10.821 --> 00:07:12.606
<i>Many of the best players
in the League are anxious</i>

136
00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.738
<i>to leave on account
of the Colored element.</i>

137
00:07:15.347 --> 00:07:18.655
<i>and the board finally directed
Secretary White to approve</i>

138
00:07:18.829 --> 00:07:21.397
<i>of no more contracts
with Colored men.</i>

139
00:07:23.312 --> 00:07:26.837
<i>African American
ballplayers were very good</i>

140
00:07:27.011 --> 00:07:28.926
<i>at this game.
and they were so good</i>

141
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.102
<i>at the game
that the fear was that.</i>

142
00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:33.670
you know.
they would consume the positions

143
00:07:33.844 --> 00:07:36.412
<i>that White players
were vying for.</i>

144
00:07:38.414 --> 00:07:39.850
<i>In 1896. we have</i>

145
00:07:40.024 --> 00:07:42.549
<i>the Plessy
versus Ferguson decision</i>

146
00:07:42.853 --> 00:07:45.769
<i>that determines
that separate is equal.</i>

147
00:07:46.161 --> 00:07:48.511
<i>Now. it's not. and we know that.</i>

148
00:07:48.685 --> 00:07:51.122
<i>And so. it sets up. essentially.</i>

149
00:07:51.296 --> 00:07:53.951
<i>what we have going well
into the 20th century.</i>

150
00:07:54.169 --> 00:07:56.258
<i>which is this legal doctrine
that says.</i>

151
00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:58.782
<i>"It is okay
to keep everyone separate."</i>

152
00:07:59.391 --> 00:08:03.308
What was happening there
is that a hand goes up

153
00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:06.703
with a stop sign on it.
and it's saying to Blacks

154
00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:10.054
<i>outside of baseball.
but also inside of baseball.</i>

155
00:08:10.228 --> 00:08:12.492
<i>"You can't do this.
You can't do that.</i>

156
00:08:12.666 --> 00:08:15.103
<i>You can't go here.
You can't be this."</i>

157
00:08:17.801 --> 00:08:21.544
<i>Well. what do you do
when that comes at you?</i>

158
00:08:23.285 --> 00:08:25.374
<i>You turn
back into yourself.</i>

159
00:08:25.809 --> 00:08:28.072
<i>You find resources
that are your own resources.</i>

160
00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:31.380
<i>and you establish things
for yourself</i>

161
00:08:31.598 --> 00:08:33.556
<i>that the larger world is saying
you can't do.</i>

162
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:34.949
<i>et cetera. et cetera.</i>

163
00:08:36.907 --> 00:08:38.213
<i>Really all over the country</i>

164
00:08:38.387 --> 00:08:40.041
<i>Black people
were coming together</i>

165
00:08:40.215 --> 00:08:43.784
<i>and forming these
self-sustaining communities.</i>

166
00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.830
It's okay if they never fully
bring us into society.

167
00:08:47.004 --> 00:08:48.005
We can do it ourselves.

168
00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:53.184
<i>We enjoyed ourselves
because we were by ourselves.</i>

169
00:08:53.358 --> 00:08:55.578
<i>And nobody trying to tell us
what to do.</i>

170
00:08:55.926 --> 00:08:59.147
<i>So we learn how to do

171
00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.759
<i>See. what do old ladies say?
"Got to use what you got"?</i>

172
00:09:03.412 --> 00:09:05.109
<i>So we had to use what we had.</i>

173
00:09:05.632 --> 00:09:07.764
<i>So Black businesses
come into being</i>

174
00:09:07.938 --> 00:09:09.374
<i>in that period of time.</i>

175
00:09:09.766 --> 00:09:12.334
<i>founded for themselves
out of their own resources.</i>

176
00:09:12.508 --> 00:09:15.990
<i>Black schools and baseball too.</i>

177
00:09:17.034 --> 00:09:19.515
<i>After the Plessy versus Ferguson decision.</i>

178
00:09:19.689 --> 00:09:23.911
<i>great Black professional
baseball teams come into being.</i>

179
00:09:24.607 --> 00:09:29.438
<i>and the players and the games
were ballyhooed by newspapers</i>

180
00:09:29.917 --> 00:09:32.006
<i>that were their own newspapers.</i>

181
00:09:32.267 --> 00:09:34.356
And those newspapers knew

182
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:36.576
the audience
that they had to play to.

183
00:09:40.405 --> 00:09:42.712
<i>Everybody read
the</i> Chicago Defender

184
00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:44.845
<i>and thePittsburgh Courier...</i>

185
00:09:45.019 --> 00:09:48.457
<i>...the two leading
Black newspapers in the country.</i>

186
00:09:48.892 --> 00:09:51.329
My grandmother.
in our little town.

187
00:09:51.721 --> 00:09:55.029
wouldn't take
the weekly newspaper.

188
00:09:55.333 --> 00:09:56.683
She said it was written

189
00:09:56.857 --> 00:09:58.815
for Whites. by Whites.
and about Whites.

190
00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:01.470
<i>I mean. there were
several major Black newspapers.</i>

191
00:10:01.644 --> 00:10:03.037
<i>and</i> Chicago Defender

192
00:10:03.211 --> 00:10:05.561
<i>was probably the major
Black newspaper.</i>

193
00:10:05.779 --> 00:10:07.171
And lots of people read it.

194
00:10:07.345 --> 00:10:08.651
Lots of Black people read it
in the South.

195
00:10:09.173 --> 00:10:11.785
<i>And the</i> Chicago Defender
<i>was a big promoter</i>

196
00:10:11.959 --> 00:10:14.004
<i>of Black people
moving to the North.</i>

197
00:10:16.964 --> 00:10:18.400
<i>It was a push-pull thing.</i>

198
00:10:18.574 --> 00:10:20.184
<i>You're being attracted
by the possibility</i>

199
00:10:20.358 --> 00:10:22.665
<i>that life could be better
for you moving.</i>

200
00:10:22.839 --> 00:10:25.537
<i>and you want to get away
from a situation that's bad.</i>

201
00:10:25.712 --> 00:10:27.061
<i>So something's pushing you out.</i>

202
00:10:27.235 --> 00:10:28.889
as well as something
is pulling you forward.

203
00:10:30.586 --> 00:10:32.457
Bob M: <i>For Blacks
in the Jim Crow South.</i>

204
00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:33.763
<i>life was a struggle.</i>

205
00:10:34.546 --> 00:10:36.157
<i>Where I grew up in Alabama.</i>

206
00:10:36.592 --> 00:10:38.550
<i>fear and violence
were commonplace.</i>

207
00:10:40.465 --> 00:10:43.904
<i>The Ku Klux Klan always did
its dirty work at night</i>

208
00:10:44.078 --> 00:10:46.210
<i>and would often drive
right past us on the way</i>

209
00:10:46.384 --> 00:10:48.822
<i>to a lynching
or cross-burning ceremony.</i>

210
00:10:50.737 --> 00:10:52.216
Bob M: <i>Mama would shout.</i>

211
00:10:52.477 --> 00:10:54.262
<i>"Y'all kids. hurry up.
and turn off the lights.</i>

212
00:10:54.436 --> 00:10:56.046
<i>and lay down on the floor."</i>

213
00:10:56.438 --> 00:10:59.006
<i>With the house pitch black.
I could hear my heart pounding</i>

214
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.616
<i>with terror as I lay there.</i>

215
00:11:01.182 --> 00:11:02.705
<i>If rifles were shooting
in the air...</i>

216
00:11:02.879 --> 00:11:03.793
<i>...then we knew</i>

217
00:11:03.967 --> 00:11:05.403
<i>some poor Black soul</i>

218
00:11:05.577 --> 00:11:07.362
<i>had been lynched
just over the hill.</i>

219
00:11:11.714 --> 00:11:13.716
<i>My brother had written me
several times.</i>

220
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:15.936
<i>encouraging me to join him
in the North.</i>

221
00:11:16.458 --> 00:11:17.851
<i>I longed to go.</i>

222
00:11:18.503 --> 00:11:22.159
<i>So on a chilly October day.
I hopped aboard a freight train.</i>

223
00:11:23.073 --> 00:11:24.858
<i>As the train chugged forward.</i>

224
00:11:25.032 --> 00:11:27.077
<i>I could feel the weight
of Southern oppression</i>

225
00:11:27.251 --> 00:11:28.775
<i>lifted off my shoulders.</i>

226
00:11:29.123 --> 00:11:31.560
<i>on our way
to a promised land of jobs.</i>

227
00:11:31.734 --> 00:11:33.257
<i>independence...</i>

228
00:11:33.431 --> 00:11:36.217
<i>...and a better life
for a Colored man in America.</i>

229
00:11:37.087 --> 00:11:38.610
<i>We had a dream.</i>

230
00:11:39.481 --> 00:11:41.178
<i>People felt that</i>

231
00:11:41.483 --> 00:11:44.268
<i>this is a land of opportunity.
Okay. so I will move North.</i>

232
00:11:44.616 --> 00:11:47.054
I will move West. et cetera.

233
00:11:47.228 --> 00:11:52.189
All of these areas where we hope
to find the real America.

234
00:11:52.363 --> 00:11:55.584
<i>America that allows us
to be all we can be.</i>

235
00:11:55.976 --> 00:11:57.412
<i>all we can become.</i>

236
00:11:58.239 --> 00:12:00.937
<i>And it's a flood tide.
that immigration.</i>

237
00:12:01.329 --> 00:12:03.157
<i>Over a million Blacks come up</i>

238
00:12:03.331 --> 00:12:06.464
<i>out of the South to settle in
urban centers in the North.</i>

239
00:12:07.857 --> 00:12:10.817
<i>So it's no surprise
that Black baseball</i>

240
00:12:10.991 --> 00:12:13.994
<i>would develop as Black people
moved out of the South</i>

241
00:12:14.211 --> 00:12:16.387
<i>and into cities
where the segregation</i>

242
00:12:16.561 --> 00:12:20.130
<i>was a little less rigid
and they had transportation</i>

243
00:12:20.304 --> 00:12:22.480
<i>to get people to go
to a ballgame.</i>

244
00:12:22.785 --> 00:12:24.918
<i>These kinds of things
made a huge difference</i>

245
00:12:25.092 --> 00:12:26.484
<i>in making it possible
for Black people</i>

246
00:12:26.658 --> 00:12:28.835
<i>to have an array
of teams in cities.</i>

247
00:12:32.099 --> 00:12:33.883
<i>So now. you see</i>

248
00:12:34.492 --> 00:12:37.887
a few entrepreneurs trying
to make a go of it in baseball.

249
00:12:38.453 --> 00:12:42.805
<i>And people like Rube Foster.
in Chicago. is able to see</i>

250
00:12:42.979 --> 00:12:44.981
<i>that a Black club can be</i>

251
00:12:45.199 --> 00:12:47.201
<i>a successful
business enterprise.</i>

252
00:12:50.421 --> 00:12:54.774
Bob K: <i>Andrew Rube Foster owned
the Chicago American Giants.</i>

253
00:12:54.948 --> 00:12:57.733
and he managed
the Chicago American Giants.

254
00:12:58.212 --> 00:13:01.128
And Rube Foster.
in my own estimation.

255
00:13:01.302 --> 00:13:05.915
is the greatest baseball mind
this sport has ever seen.

256
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:09.397
Rube Foster was light-years
ahead of his time.

257
00:13:10.398 --> 00:13:12.095
<i>He was better known
as a pitcher.</i>

258
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.969
<i>he pitched seven no-hitters
in his brilliant career.</i>

259
00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.667
<i>Quite frankly.
by 1905. he might have been</i>

260
00:13:18.841 --> 00:13:20.930
<i>the greatest pitcher
in the world.</i>

261
00:13:21.452 --> 00:13:23.411
Bob K: <i>He is credited
with having invented</i>

262
00:13:23.585 --> 00:13:26.544
<i>what we now know
to be the screwball.</i>

263
00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:29.025
<i>Back then. it was called
a "fade away."</i>

264
00:13:29.547 --> 00:13:32.072
and ol' Rube perfected
this pitch.

265
00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:35.162
<i>So much so that the great</i>

266
00:13:35.336 --> 00:13:37.904
<i>Major League manager.
John McGraw.</i>

267
00:13:38.469 --> 00:13:43.648
<i>would sneak Rube into his camp
so that Rube Foster could teach</i>

268
00:13:43.866 --> 00:13:47.043
<i>Christy Mathewson how to throw
the screwball.</i>

269
00:13:47.565 --> 00:13:49.741
<i>Christy Mathewson threw
the pitch all the way</i>

270
00:13:49.916 --> 00:13:52.005
<i>into the National Baseball
Hall of Fame.</i>

271
00:13:52.179 --> 00:13:54.268
<i>that he learned
from Rube Foster.</i>

272
00:13:55.791 --> 00:14:01.057
<i>Rube's greatest asset
was his genius as a manager</i>

273
00:14:01.231 --> 00:14:02.885
<i>and as an executive.</i>

274
00:14:03.059 --> 00:14:05.888
He's the founder
of the Chicago American Giants.

275
00:14:06.106 --> 00:14:10.501
1910 or thereabouts
and through the next decade.

276
00:14:10.675 --> 00:14:13.722
<i>Rube Foster makes that team
into the greatest Black team</i>

277
00:14:13.896 --> 00:14:16.116
<i>up to that point in time
that there was.</i>

278
00:14:16.812 --> 00:14:19.423
<i>Mr. Foster
was a pretty smart dude. now.</i>

279
00:14:19.815 --> 00:14:22.209
You would thought he went
to school somewhere.

280
00:14:22.687 --> 00:14:24.211
but he didn't.

281
00:14:24.559 --> 00:14:27.692
<i>He would go down South
to the Negro colleges in Texas.</i>

282
00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:30.521
<i>and he would get
a lot of the ballplayers</i>

283
00:14:30.957 --> 00:14:32.045
<i>out of the schools.</i>

284
00:14:33.046 --> 00:14:36.353
<i>If he was a fast man.
a good runner. he'd say.</i>

285
00:14:36.527 --> 00:14:39.443
<i>"Would you put on
some football pads?</i>

286
00:14:39.835 --> 00:14:41.184
<i>I want you to learn</i>

287
00:14:41.358 --> 00:14:43.056
<i>how to steal bases."</i>

288
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.753
<i>And Mr. Foster taught
them all the tricks.</i>

289
00:14:46.015 --> 00:14:49.801
He exploited the rules
to his maximum benefit.

290
00:14:50.106 --> 00:14:51.803
<i>We're looking
at a bunt-and-run...</i>

291
00:14:51.978 --> 00:14:53.980
<i>...drag bunting...</i>

292
00:14:56.025 --> 00:14:57.113
<i>double steals...</i>

293
00:14:59.028 --> 00:15:01.465
<i>a suicide squeeze play
at home plate.</i>

294
00:15:01.726 --> 00:15:03.206
<i>He made the game more up tempo.</i>

295
00:15:03.772 --> 00:15:06.383
You see. he was adamant
about the style of play

296
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:09.909
that would become signature
Negro Leagues Baseball.

297
00:15:10.126 --> 00:15:13.390
<i>Fast. aggressive. daring.</i>

298
00:15:13.564 --> 00:15:14.957
<i>They bunt their way up.</i>

299
00:15:15.175 --> 00:15:17.133
<i>They steal second.
they steal third.</i>

300
00:15:17.307 --> 00:15:19.005
And. man.
if you weren't too smart.

301
00:15:19.179 --> 00:15:20.528
they were stealing home.

302
00:15:30.712 --> 00:15:32.235
<i>During World War I.</i>

303
00:15:32.409 --> 00:15:34.977
<i>W.E.B. Du Bois wrote
a very famous editorial</i>

305
00:15:37.327 --> 00:15:40.461
<i>He told Black people.

<i>...372nd on the plains
of Mons-En-Chaussée.</i>

311
00:15:59.567 --> 00:16:01.047
But he thought that doing this.

312
00:16:01.221 --> 00:16:03.049
Black people would show
their loyalty.

313
00:16:03.223 --> 00:16:05.399
<i>and Black people would show
they were American citizens.</i>

314
00:16:05.573 --> 00:16:07.357
<i>and Black people would show
that they were putting</i>

315

<i>above being Black.
and that this would get them</i>

317
00:16:12.058 --> 00:16:14.147
<i>some degree of acceptance.
This would get them some degree</i>

318
00:16:14.321 --> 00:16:16.714
<i>of White people listening
to their grievances</i>

319
00:16:16.888 --> 00:16:18.107
and responding
to their grievances.

320
00:16:18.281 --> 00:16:19.282
He turned out
to be totally wrong.

321
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.416
<i>What happens is that

322

325
00:16:37.866 --> 00:16:41.261
<i>The Red Summer of 1919
was one of the worst summers</i>

326

327

<i>From the late winter
up until the following fall.</i>

328
00:16:49.573 --> 00:16:52.707
<i>there was violence all over.
and it was. almost all of it</i>

329
00:16:52.881 --> 00:16:55.014
<i>was White violence
against Blacks.</i>

330
00:17:11.465 --> 00:17:13.554
<i>The most noted
was Chicago.</i>

331
00:17:13.858 --> 00:17:16.992

<i>It happened all over.</i>

334

338
00:17:41.582 --> 00:17:44.498
<i>in another kind of way
to build our own institutions.</i>

339
00:17:54.682 --> 00:17:55.683
<i>You had the rise</i>

340
00:17:55.857 --> 00:17:57.293
<i>of someone like Marcus Garvey.</i>

341
00:17:57.467 --> 00:17:59.904
<i>You had people
who were telling Black people.</i>

342
00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:02.385
<i>in essence.
that they had a destiny.</i>

343
00:18:02.646 --> 00:18:04.692
<i>Soon after.
we got Alain Locke writing</i>

344
00:18:04.866 --> 00:18:06.824
<i>his great book called.</i>
The New Negro.

345
00:18:07.042 --> 00:18:09.044
<i>The New Negro had a new voice.</i>

346
00:18:09.349 --> 00:18:11.133
<i>The New Negro was not going</i>

347
00:18:11.307 --> 00:18:15.268
<i>to sit back and accept these
segregated sanctions anymore.</i>

348
00:18:15.485 --> 00:18:17.270
<i>And so we got a new mindset.</i>

349
00:18:17.574 --> 00:18:20.838
This is the perfect time
in America to start

350
00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.798
an organized league in 1920.

351
00:18:25.321 --> 00:18:27.541
<i>Rube Foster
certainly has to be aware</i>

352
00:18:27.715 --> 00:18:30.021
<i>of all these people
trying to figure out</i>

353
00:18:30.196 --> 00:18:32.633
how to move Black people forward

354
00:18:32.807 --> 00:18:35.853
in a society that has constantly
ostracized them.

355
00:18:36.027 --> 00:18:37.594
that has kept them
on the margins

356
00:18:37.768 --> 00:18:39.640
and doesn't appear
to be changing.

357
00:18:40.162 --> 00:18:44.949
<i>So Rube Foster wrote
a series of op-eds called.</i>

358
00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:48.388
<i>"The Pitfalls of Baseball"
for the</i> Chicago Defender.

359
00:18:48.562 --> 00:18:50.912
and he talked
about the importance

360
00:18:51.086 --> 00:18:54.133
of organizing Black baseball.

361
00:18:54.785 --> 00:18:56.439
<i>How it would benefit.</i>

362
00:18:56.613 --> 00:18:59.964
<i>not just the players.
but the owners of each team.</i>

363
00:19:00.139 --> 00:19:02.967
<i>for them to form
this connected league</i>

364
00:19:03.229 --> 00:19:06.014
and to have scheduled games
and play against each other

365
00:19:06.188 --> 00:19:08.495
and build a fan base.

366
00:19:09.539 --> 00:19:11.889
<i>"I have fought against
delivering Colored baseball</i>

367
00:19:12.063 --> 00:19:13.543
<i>into the control of Whites.</i>

368
00:19:14.065 --> 00:19:16.590
<i>thinking that with a show
of patronage from the fans</i>

369
00:19:16.851 --> 00:19:18.287
<i>we would get together."</i>

370
00:19:20.463 --> 00:19:24.554
<i>So he gets paperwork
done in the state of Illinois</i>

371
00:19:24.728 --> 00:19:27.078
<i>to incorporate
this non-existent league</i>

372
00:19:27.253 --> 00:19:29.646
<i>that no one has even agreed
to do yet.</i>

373
00:19:30.125 --> 00:19:33.128
And he gets these
other team owners to agree.

374
00:19:33.302 --> 00:19:36.175
<i>and they meet
in Kansas City at the Y.</i>

375
00:19:37.872 --> 00:19:39.917
Bob K: <i>You know.
I wish I could have been</i>

376
00:19:40.091 --> 00:19:42.920
a fly on the wall in that room
because Rube Foster had to be

377
00:19:43.094 --> 00:19:44.357
a master salesman.

378
00:19:44.531 --> 00:19:46.185
He had to be
because he had pulled

379
00:19:46.359 --> 00:19:48.099
<i>these independent
Black baseball team owners.</i>

380
00:19:48.274 --> 00:19:49.884
<i>So they were already
making money.</i>

381
00:19:50.058 --> 00:19:53.235
<i>And now he had to convince them
that they could be</i>

382
00:19:53.409 --> 00:19:57.065
<i>even more successful
if we organize</i>

383
00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:59.937
<i>and we now share
a piece of the pie</i>

384
00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:02.201
<i>by creating our own league.</i>

385
00:20:02.897 --> 00:20:04.986
And so. you know Rube
was a great salesman

386
00:20:05.247 --> 00:20:07.249
because he was able to do that.

387
00:20:08.032 --> 00:20:11.775
<i>And on February 13th. 1920.
they walked out having signed</i>

388
00:20:11.949 --> 00:20:14.256
<i>the documents to start
the Negro National League.</i>

389
00:20:16.606 --> 00:20:18.478
<i>His motto for the League</i>

390
00:20:18.826 --> 00:20:21.002
<i>he stole from abolitionist
Frederick Douglass.</i>

391
00:20:21.872 --> 00:20:23.091
"We are the ship..."

392
00:20:23.265 --> 00:20:24.788
- "...and all else..."
- "...the sea."

393
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.618
Bob K:
<i>Yeah. he was serving notice</i>

394
00:20:28.792 --> 00:20:30.185
<i>to Major League Baseball</i>

395
00:20:30.359 --> 00:20:32.405
<i>that a new player had arrived
on the scene</i>

396
00:20:32.579 --> 00:20:33.797
<i>to be reckoned with.</i>

397
00:20:44.721 --> 00:20:46.288
Bob M: <i>When it came
to promoting a game.</i>

398
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:49.160
<i>no one did it better
than the Negro Leagues.</i>

399
00:20:49.726 --> 00:20:51.989
<i>Window placards.
newspaper advertisements.</i>

400
00:20:52.338 --> 00:20:53.817
<i>and word-of-mouth
were in the works.</i>

401
00:20:53.991 --> 00:20:56.080
<i>well in advance for most games.</i>

402
00:20:57.299 --> 00:20:59.910
<i>Sometimes I spent the ten cents
to buy a ticket.</i>

403
00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:02.739
<i>Other times.
I'd peer through the knotholes</i>

404
00:21:02.913 --> 00:21:05.176
<i>in the wooden fence
outside the stadium.</i>

405
00:21:08.179 --> 00:21:10.965
<i>Pitchers zipped balls
with such speed across the plate</i>

406
00:21:11.226 --> 00:21:12.880
<i>that it was hard
to follow the pitch.</i>

407
00:21:13.968 --> 00:21:15.491
<i>Batters stretched singles</i>

408
00:21:15.665 --> 00:21:16.971
<i>into doubles.
and doubles into triples.</i>

409
00:21:17.188 --> 00:21:18.451
<i>with lightning speed.</i>

410
00:21:19.539 --> 00:21:21.584
<i>It was obvious the fans
didn't want the celebration</i>

411
00:21:21.758 --> 00:21:23.847
<i>to end. and neither did I.</i>

412
00:21:25.501 --> 00:21:28.591
Negro Leagues baseball
was so popular

413
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:35.337
that Black churches would move
their service time up an hour

414
00:21:36.164 --> 00:21:37.861
so fans could go to the game.

415
00:21:38.253 --> 00:21:41.648
If you know anything
about the Black church.

416
00:21:42.039 --> 00:21:43.606
you don't mess
with service time.

417
00:21:43.824 --> 00:21:45.652
<i>But when the great Kansas City
Monarchs are playing.</i>

418
00:21:45.826 --> 00:21:47.480
<i>any of those great Black teams.</i>

419
00:21:47.828 --> 00:21:50.439
<i>service time would move up
to ten o'clock.</i>

420
00:21:50.657 --> 00:21:53.529
<i>and everybody filed out
going to that</i>

421
00:21:53.703 --> 00:21:56.140
<i>Sunday doubleheader
looking good.</i>

422
00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.621
<i>When they went
to baseball games.</i>

423
00:21:58.795 --> 00:22:01.363
<i>men would dress very sharply.</i>

424
00:22:01.755 --> 00:22:05.628
<i>Ladies wore dresses
and big hats. beautiful hats.</i>

425
00:22:06.194 --> 00:22:08.370
<i>with flowers
and whatnot on them.</i>

426
00:22:08.849 --> 00:22:13.549
<i>You would buy the fanciest
clothing in the world.</i>

427
00:22:14.811 --> 00:22:16.378
<i>The age
of the 20th century.</i>

428
00:22:16.552 --> 00:22:18.946
<i>the Harlem Renaissance.
New Negro Renaissance.</i>

429
00:22:19.207 --> 00:22:21.688
<i>was the age of the rise
of the Black professional.</i>

430
00:22:21.862 --> 00:22:24.299
<i>You know. you got
a new kind of presentation</i>

431
00:22:24.473 --> 00:22:25.953
<i>of the Black
professional musician.</i>

432
00:22:26.127 --> 00:22:27.781
<i>You got a new kind

433
00:22:28.042 --> 00:22:29.696
<i>of the Black
professional athlete</i>

434

<i>with Negro League Baseball.</i>

435
00:22:31.654 --> 00:22:34.875
<i>These were professional men.

436
00:22:35.223 --> 00:22:38.052
<i>who were doing something
at a very. very high level</i>

437
00:22:38.531 --> 00:22:40.054
<i>and had a tremendous virtuosity.</i>

438
00:22:40.271 --> 00:22:42.230
Any time you saw
Black people doing something

439
00:22:42.404 --> 00:22:45.364
that was virtuosic.
you always... You felt like.

440
00:22:45.538 --> 00:22:47.191
"Okay. I can go on

441
00:22:47.366 --> 00:22:48.845
and deal
with the rest of my week...

442
00:22:49.019 --> 00:22:50.586
...'cause I saw
some Black people doing

443
00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.240
something
that's really excellent."

444
00:22:58.377 --> 00:23:00.770
<i>That's a home run
in the right field</i>

445
00:23:00.944 --> 00:23:03.860
<i>into the stands!
First home run of the series!</i>

446
00:23:06.036 --> 00:23:07.603
<i>Meanwhile.</i>

447
00:23:08.038 --> 00:23:10.650
<i>White baseball will soon become
a station-to-station game.</i>

448
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:15.916
You don't run. You don't steal.
You don't bunt. No hit and run.

449
00:23:16.438 --> 00:23:18.658
<i>You try to hit it out
of the park.</i>

450
00:23:19.398 --> 00:23:23.271
<i>And I think that's a reflection
of Babe Ruth's influence.</i>

451
00:23:23.619 --> 00:23:25.491
<i>But it's. in many ways.
the antithesis</i>

00:23:30.539 --> 00:23:33.412
<i>flipped it behind his back.
start the double play...</i>

455
00:23:35.109 --> 00:23:37.241
<i>well. we see that now
every night of the week</i>

456
00:23:37.416 --> 00:23:40.549
<i>as a top-ten highlight
on some network.</i>

457
00:23:42.421 --> 00:23:44.510
<i>Back then. the Major Leaguers
would say</i>

458
00:23:44.684 --> 00:23:46.599
<i>that they were "showboating."</i>

459
00:23:47.556 --> 00:23:49.732
<i>But what the Major Leaguers
were trying to say then</i>

460
00:23:49.906 --> 00:23:51.255
<i>that the Negro Leagues
didn't play the game</i>

461
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:52.648
<i>the right way.</i>

462
00:23:53.301 --> 00:23:56.826
<i>But really that was a code word
to say they didn't play the game</i>

463
00:23:57.044 --> 00:23:58.306
<i>the White way.</i>

464
00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.836
<i>But still.
it was a fabulous time</i>

465
00:24:07.228 --> 00:24:08.838
<i>for Black men in baseball</i>

466
00:24:09.012 --> 00:24:11.450
because coming out
of World War I.

467
00:24:11.624 --> 00:24:14.365
there were lots of people
who were looking

468
00:24:14.844 --> 00:24:16.672
for that equality.
but now they have

469
00:24:16.846 --> 00:24:18.326
their own league.
How about that?

470
00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:23.070
<i>So once Rube Foster organizes
the Negro National League.</i>

471
00:24:23.462 --> 00:24:26.595
<i>other people start to see that.
"Hey. there's a possibility."</i>

472
00:24:27.248 --> 00:24:29.032
<i>1923 rolls around.</i>

473
00:24:29.206 --> 00:24:31.687
<i>There's a guy in Philadelphia
by the name of Ed Bolden.</i>

474
00:24:32.209 --> 00:24:34.168
<i>and he'd worked
for the post office for years.</i>

475
00:24:34.342 --> 00:24:36.823
<i>He was the owner
of the Hilldale team.</i>

476
00:24:37.127 --> 00:24:38.868
He sees the writing on the wall.

477
00:24:39.042 --> 00:24:43.394
that Rube Foster's influence
is headed towards the East.

478
00:24:43.786 --> 00:24:45.571
So Ed Bolden gets

479
00:24:45.745 --> 00:24:48.225
<i>all of the Eastern teams together.</i>

480
00:24:48.399 --> 00:24:49.879
<i>and they have a big meeting.
and they form</i>

481
00:24:50.053 --> 00:24:52.534
<i>the Eastern Colored League
in 1923.</i>

482
00:24:55.015 --> 00:24:57.060
<i>With the creation

<i>has a competitive league</i>

486
00:25:03.632 --> 00:25:05.721
<i>that now they can stage

<i>So in 1924.

491
00:25:17.951 --> 00:25:21.432
<i>The World Series in 1924
was the best of nine.</i>

492
00:25:21.998 --> 00:25:23.609
<i>not seven like it is today.</i>

493
00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:26.699
<i>It turned out to be
a great series.</i>

494
00:25:27.047 --> 00:25:28.744
<i>Series is tied up
four games each.</i>

495
00:25:28.918 --> 00:25:30.050
<i>We're in Chicago now.</i>

496
00:25:30.224 --> 00:25:31.486
the weather is
in the mid-fifties.

497
00:25:31.965 --> 00:25:34.576
<i>José Méndez has a cold.
and Rube Foster says.</i>

498
00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:36.099
<i>"You have to pitch this game."</i>

499
00:25:36.447 --> 00:25:38.493
<i>Hilldale comes out

<i>During that time.
only one man reached first.</i>

504
00:25:49.591 --> 00:25:50.897
<i>Then came the eighth.</i>

505
00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:54.030
But he runs out of gas
and he starts to pitch overhand.

506
00:25:54.204 --> 00:25:55.989
<i>The bases were full.</i>

507
00:25:56.206 --> 00:25:58.731
<i>Allen looked over the ball.
then singled to right scoring.</i>

508
00:25:58.905 --> 00:26:00.646
<i>Duncan slid into home plate...</i>

509
00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:03.083
<i>...half a second
ahead of Riggs' throw to Santop.</i>

510
00:26:03.344 --> 00:26:04.954
<i>Monarchs score five runs</i>

511
00:26:05.302 --> 00:26:09.263

shuts out the Hilldale Club.

512
00:26:09.872 --> 00:26:12.483
<i>and the Monarchs take
the most dramatic World Series</i>

513
00:26:12.658 --> 00:26:13.789
<i>ever played.</i>

514
00:26:18.925 --> 00:26:21.667
It really kind of
established Black baseball.

515
00:26:21.841 --> 00:26:24.539
It was saying to White baseball.
"Look. we're the same.

516
00:26:24.713 --> 00:26:27.673
<i>We have the same end of the year
championship series.</i>

517
00:26:27.847 --> 00:26:29.283
<i>the same way you do.</i>

518
00:26:29.457 --> 00:26:30.937
<i>We've got
our two separate leagues.</i>

519
00:26:31.111 --> 00:26:32.634
<i>like the National
and American League.</i>

520
00:26:32.808 --> 00:26:35.115
<i>the same way you do."
And that was important.</i>

521
00:26:35.289 --> 00:26:39.423
As much as Rube Foster
and other executives wanted to.

522
00:26:39.598 --> 00:26:41.904
you know. get into baseball.
and have successful teams.

523
00:26:42.078 --> 00:26:43.645
so they could make
their own money

524
00:26:43.819 --> 00:26:45.734
and so that they could do this
incredible thing for

525
00:26:45.908 --> 00:26:47.301
and within the Black community.

526
00:26:47.475 --> 00:26:50.086
There was also
this constant effort

527
00:26:50.434 --> 00:26:53.350
to show White baseball
that Black baseball

528
00:26:53.524 --> 00:26:55.788
was good enough.
with the hopes that. ultimately.

529
00:26:56.005 --> 00:26:58.617
Black baseball could become one
with White baseball.

530
00:26:58.791 --> 00:26:59.792
that they could join forces.

531
00:27:01.141 --> 00:27:02.838
Bob K: <i>And Rube's initial vision</i>

532
00:27:03.099 --> 00:27:06.712
<i>was that he would create
a league that was so dynamic.</i>

533
00:27:07.103 --> 00:27:10.933
<i>that he would force Major League
Baseball's hand to expand.</i>

534
00:27:11.586 --> 00:27:15.155
So if we were looking at it
in a more modern-day context.

535
00:27:16.025 --> 00:27:19.899
<i>think football with the NFL
and the AFL merger.</i>

536
00:27:20.116 --> 00:27:22.075
<i>or for those
who are basketball fans.</i>

537
00:27:22.249 --> 00:27:24.817
<i>the merger of the NBA
and the ABA.</i>

538
00:27:25.208 --> 00:27:28.647
<i>Now. this was Rube Foster
in the 1920s.</i>

539
00:27:28.864 --> 00:27:32.651
<i>That's how forward-thinking
and how much a visionary</i>

540
00:27:32.825 --> 00:27:34.391
<i>this man was.</i>

541
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.747
<i>Well. Rube Foster
was in Indianapolis for a game</i>

542
00:27:41.921 --> 00:27:44.401
<i>in May of 1925.</i>

543
00:27:45.185 --> 00:27:46.926
<i>and unfortunately.
he was subjected</i>

544
00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:51.278
<i>to carbon monoxide poisoning
from a leaky gas heater.</i>

545
00:27:51.974 --> 00:27:54.020
<i>Oh. he was rescued
by his teammates</i>

546
00:27:54.194 --> 00:27:57.240
<i>who came to his room
to deliver a telegram.</i>

547
00:27:57.937 --> 00:28:01.810
<i>Some newspaper accounts said
he was in serious condition.</i>

548
00:28:02.506 --> 00:28:03.899
<i>He was rushed to the hospital.</i>

549
00:28:04.204 --> 00:28:06.641
I don't think
he ever fully recovered.

550
00:28:06.815 --> 00:28:09.339
By September
of the following year. in 1926.

551
00:28:09.513 --> 00:28:11.646
he was admitted to a sanitarium.

552
00:28:36.105 --> 00:28:40.066
<i>Rube Foster died
on December the 9th. 1930.</i>

553
00:28:42.111 --> 00:28:44.592
Bob K: <i>And Rube Foster.
when he dies.</i>

554
00:28:45.332 --> 00:28:48.509
<i>the fans of Chicago lined
the streets for three days</i>

555
00:28:49.031 --> 00:28:52.121
<i>to pay their respect
to their beloved Rube Foster.</i>

556
00:28:53.601 --> 00:28:55.429
<i>Thousands of people
came from afar</i>

557
00:28:55.603 --> 00:28:57.561
<i>to celebrate this great legend.</i>

558
00:28:58.606 --> 00:29:00.651
<i>Rube Foster's death
was a great loss</i>

559
00:29:00.956 --> 00:29:02.741
to baseball and Black America.

560
00:29:04.307 --> 00:29:06.527
<i>And the Negro National League</i>

561
00:29:06.701 --> 00:29:08.442
<i>began to struggle.</i>

562
00:29:08.921 --> 00:29:11.750
And then. of course.
not only do they lose Foster.

563
00:29:11.924 --> 00:29:13.534
the Great Depression hits.

564
00:29:13.752 --> 00:29:16.232
And so the combination. I think.
of the two of those things

565
00:29:16.406 --> 00:29:17.843
really brings about the demise

566
00:29:18.017 --> 00:29:19.583
of that first
Negro National League.

567
00:29:30.246 --> 00:29:32.031
<i>As bad
as the Great Depression was</i>

568
00:29:32.205 --> 00:29:35.121
<i>for most White Americans.
it was a heck of a lot worse</i>

569
00:29:35.338 --> 00:29:36.818
<i>for Black Americans.</i>

570
00:29:38.037 --> 00:29:40.604
<i>When it comes
to Blacks. it's the old phrase.</i>

571
00:29:40.779 --> 00:29:43.172
<i>"Last hired. first fired."</i>

572
00:29:43.346 --> 00:29:44.739
That's what faced Blacks.

573
00:29:45.609 --> 00:29:48.221
<i>So the Black community.

574
00:29:48.395 --> 00:29:52.486
a certain measure
of economic success in the '20s.

575
00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:55.402
<i>is once again facing hard times.</i>

576
00:29:57.752 --> 00:30:00.537
<i>And that was a bad time

577
00:30:00.711 --> 00:30:02.148
<i>not only the Blacks.</i>

578
00:30:02.583 --> 00:30:05.020
<i>but for the majority
of poor people. It was bad.</i>

579
00:30:05.325 --> 00:30:07.675
I know. They could come
to a baseball game.

580
00:30:07.849 --> 00:30:09.242
forget about all their woes.

581
00:30:09.808 --> 00:30:12.201
And I was just as proud
of making them happy.

582
00:30:12.375 --> 00:30:13.550
And when I'd come in.

583
00:30:13.724 --> 00:30:15.204
you'd think
I had a million dollars.

584
00:30:15.683 --> 00:30:17.859
<i>That's how much baseball
meant to them.</i>

585

587

<i>the Homestead Grays

611

<i>And those teams had two owners.</i>

612
00:31:42.291 --> 00:31:44.076

<i>They had different styles.</i>

616
00:31:52.475 --> 00:31:55.565
I think they knew
that their rivalry was something

617
00:31:55.739 --> 00:31:57.089
that was good for both of them

618
00:31:57.263 --> 00:31:59.308

<i>His father was a fairly
well-to-do man.</i>

622
00:32:13.061 --> 00:32:14.628
<i>and so he had the time.</i>

623
00:32:14.802 --> 00:32:18.197
Most Black kids in those days
had worked after school

624
00:32:18.371 --> 00:32:19.938
and on Saturdays and Sundays...

625
00:32:20.982 --> 00:32:22.766
to supplement
your family's income.

626
00:32:22.941 --> 00:32:26.945
But Cum had the time to deal
with a hobby.

627
00:32:27.119 --> 00:32:30.252
<i>And he took some
of these Black baseball players</i>

628

00:34:36.857 --> 00:34:40.600
He might go. you know.
get eight for ten.

674
00:34:40.774 --> 00:34:43.994
you know. a 13 for 15.
You know. like that.

675
00:34:44.473 --> 00:34:45.692
Yeah. He was tough to get out.

676
00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.520
<i>Griffith Stadium.</i>

677
00:34:47.737 --> 00:34:49.478
<i>there was 405 feet down
the left of the line</i>

678
00:34:49.652 --> 00:34:52.002
<i>and behind that.
there was a scoreboard</i>

679
00:34:52.481 --> 00:34:54.788
<i>that had a big hotdog on it
with mustard on it.</i>

680
00:34:55.528 --> 00:34:58.531
And Josh hit the ball
over the 400 feet.

681
00:34:58.705 --> 00:35:00.185
up over the back
above the stands.

682
00:35:00.359 --> 00:35:02.012
and hit
that advertisement board

683
00:35:02.709 --> 00:35:04.232
<i>and peeled the paper
right off it.</i>

684
00:35:04.406 --> 00:35:05.973
<i>So we used to tease
and say that he knocked</i>

685
00:35:06.147 --> 00:35:07.366
<i>the mustard off the hotdog.</i>

686
00:35:07.801 --> 00:35:09.237
<i>I remember one time</i>

687
00:35:09.411 --> 00:35:11.196
<i>I was walking up the ramp
with Josh.</i>

688
00:35:11.718 --> 00:35:14.199
<i>and one little kid ran up.
said. "Mr. Gibson. Mr. Gibson.</i>

689
00:35:14.373 --> 00:35:16.375
<i>will you give me
one of your broken bats?"</i>

690
00:35:16.549 --> 00:35:17.854
Josh says.

691
00:35:18.159 --> 00:35:20.596
"Son. I don't break bats.
I wear them out."

692
00:35:21.684 --> 00:35:25.340
<i>Now. that Josh Gibson.
he was the type of person</i>

693
00:35:25.601 --> 00:35:27.690
<i>that just liked everybody.</i>

694
00:35:28.604 --> 00:35:31.912
<i>And always with a smile.
like a big overgrown kid.</i>

695
00:35:33.087 --> 00:35:37.483
If I step on the bus. he'd say.
"Why. oh. my. Ms. Posey."

696
00:35:37.657 --> 00:35:40.486
And he'd run
and he'd almost pick me up

697
00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:42.401
and put me in the bus
and everything

698
00:35:42.575 --> 00:35:44.098
he'd see that I had there
and say.

699
00:35:44.272 --> 00:35:46.535
And the first thing he'd say
to the boys is...

700
00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:48.624
And that was it.

701
00:35:51.149 --> 00:35:52.802
Bob K: <i>Cumberland Posey.</i>

702
00:35:52.976 --> 00:35:56.371
<i>of course. had built
the great Homestead Grays.</i>

703
00:35:57.111 --> 00:36:01.420
<i>and Cumberland Posey
had financial wherewithal.</i>

704
00:36:01.985 --> 00:36:04.031
And so he was able to pluck

705
00:36:04.205 --> 00:36:07.817
star players away
from other Black baseball teams.

706
00:36:08.166 --> 00:36:10.559
And he would do
that with regularity.

707
00:36:11.734 --> 00:36:13.649
<i>And then here comes
Gus Greenlee.</i>

708
00:36:14.172 --> 00:36:18.263
<i>Gus Greenlee would build
the great Pittsburgh Crawfords.</i>

709
00:36:18.785 --> 00:36:23.050
<i>as now a rival to Cumberland
Posey's Homestead Grays.</i>

710
00:36:24.269 --> 00:36:25.879
<i>He was in
a lot of businesses.</i>

711
00:36:26.184 --> 00:36:30.188
<i>He ran a very popular restaurant
called Crawford Grill.</i>

712
00:36:30.536 --> 00:36:32.886
and he was the leading entrepreneur

713
00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.280
in the Black numbers
gambling business.

714
00:36:36.194 --> 00:36:37.543
<i>Well. the numbers. essentially.</i>

715
00:36:37.717 --> 00:36:39.414
<i>were what we now know
as the lottery.</i>

716
00:36:40.154 --> 00:36:41.808
<i>They would base
the winning number</i>

717
00:36:41.982 --> 00:36:45.028
<i>usually on a number
in the stock tables that day.</i>

718
00:36:45.507 --> 00:36:47.988
and every day.
everybody played the numbers.

719
00:36:48.162 --> 00:36:49.468
My grandmother...

720
00:36:49.642 --> 00:36:51.209
...who. you know.
and my grandparents

721
00:36:51.383 --> 00:36:53.994
who ran a funeral home.
played the numbers every day.

722
00:36:55.256 --> 00:36:58.303
<i>Gus Greenlee was as fine
a man as you would want to know.</i>

723
00:36:58.477 --> 00:37:01.871
And I found that Gus would do
anything for anybody

724
00:37:02.045 --> 00:37:03.699
who was a friend of his.

725
00:37:04.526 --> 00:37:07.007
If he didn't even know them.
and they got in trouble.

726
00:37:07.964 --> 00:37:10.010
if there was anything
he could do to help them

727
00:37:10.184 --> 00:37:12.230
out of trouble. he would do it.

728
00:37:15.407 --> 00:37:16.712
<i>Gus Greenlee was approached</i>

729
00:37:16.886 --> 00:37:18.366
<i>by a couple members</i>

730
00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:20.455
<i>of the Pittsburgh Crawfords
baseball team.</i>

731
00:37:20.629 --> 00:37:23.502
and at the time they were
like a semi-pro sandlot team

732
00:37:23.676 --> 00:37:25.417
and. you know.
said that they needed money.

733
00:37:25.591 --> 00:37:29.072
they needed an investor.
And Gus jumped in headfirst.

734
00:37:30.726 --> 00:37:32.162
<i>When he took
the ball team.</i>

735
00:37:32.598 --> 00:37:36.602
he let us know that when he took
it that he was going to the top

736
00:37:36.776 --> 00:37:39.126
and he's gonna do
and get the best he could.

737
00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:43.739
<i>I think his top motivation
was he looked across town</i>

738
00:37:43.913 --> 00:37:46.742
<i>and he saw Cum Posey.
the son of the biggest</i>

739
00:37:46.916 --> 00:37:49.919
and wealthiest Black family
in town. and said.

740
00:37:50.093 --> 00:37:52.748
"If I can build the Crawfords
into a team

741
00:37:53.096 --> 00:37:54.794
that can beat the Grays.

742
00:37:55.273 --> 00:37:56.970
I'll be the top man
in Pittsburgh."

743
00:37:57.971 --> 00:37:59.886
Bob K: <i>He did
to Cumberland Posey.</i>

744
00:38:00.147 --> 00:38:02.628
what Posey had done
to other teams.

745
00:38:02.802 --> 00:38:06.632
<i>He outbidded Cumberland Posey
for his star players.</i>

746
00:38:06.806 --> 00:38:08.416
<i>He convinces
Oscar Charleston</i>

747
00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:11.201
<i>to cross town
and join the Crawfords.</i>

748
00:38:11.463 --> 00:38:13.073
<i>Then he sets his sight
on Josh Gibson.</i>

749
00:38:14.466 --> 00:38:18.774
<i>So now. Josh Gibson is playing
for the Crawfords.</i>

750
00:38:19.732 --> 00:38:21.821
And so he steals
every good player

751
00:38:21.995 --> 00:38:24.563
that Cumberland Posey
ever developed.

752
00:38:25.128 --> 00:38:27.870
But then the Crawfords are able
to pick up Satchel Paige.

753
00:38:32.788 --> 00:38:36.139
I just could pitch
and then the master just give me

754
00:38:36.314 --> 00:38:39.839
a home. And you just...
It was hard to beat me.

755
00:38:40.013 --> 00:38:41.319
You couldn't ought to beat me.

756
00:38:42.885 --> 00:38:46.628
<i>I did some things in baseball
I've never seen anyone else do.</i>

757
00:38:46.802 --> 00:38:48.369
<i>and I didn't know
what I was doing</i>

758
00:38:48.543 --> 00:38:50.719
<i>one half of the time.
But still. I did it.</i>

759
00:38:52.025 --> 00:38:55.071
<i>Satchel Paige is born
in Mobile. Alabama.</i>

760
00:38:55.333 --> 00:38:56.638
<i>He's dirt poor.</i>

761
00:38:56.943 --> 00:39:00.729
He has to go out
and hunt game with rocks.

762
00:39:00.903 --> 00:39:02.862
<i>and he gets his name. Satchel</i>

763
00:39:03.253 --> 00:39:06.866
<i>because later on.
after he's nine or older.</i>

764
00:39:07.257 --> 00:39:10.435
<i>he's able to work
at the railroad depot</i>

765
00:39:10.696 --> 00:39:13.960
carrying bags. luggage. satchels.

766
00:39:14.308 --> 00:39:15.570
<i>He learned how to pitch</i>

767
00:39:15.744 --> 00:39:18.573
<i>at the Mount Meigs
Reform school.</i>

768
00:39:19.313 --> 00:39:21.881
<i>And so. after that.
he comes out of there</i>

769
00:39:22.055 --> 00:39:25.188
<i>and begins his climb
to baseball fame.</i>

770
00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.017
<i>A fellow by the name
of Bill Gatewood.</i>

771
00:39:28.191 --> 00:39:31.151
<i>I just love the way he went.
the way he pitched.</i>

772
00:39:31.456 --> 00:39:34.241
<i>He said. "You know the thing is.
if you listen to me.</i>

773
00:39:34.981 --> 00:39:36.983
<i>I'll make you
one of the greatest pitchers</i>

774
00:39:37.462 --> 00:39:38.376
<i>in the world."</i>

775
00:39:39.202 --> 00:39:40.900
<i>He said.
"Because you love to play.</i>

776
00:39:41.074 --> 00:39:42.380
<i>you love the game.</i>

777
00:39:42.771 --> 00:39:44.599
<i>and you try to do
what I tell you."</i>

778
00:39:44.773 --> 00:39:46.209
<i>He says. "You see
all the fellas out there?"</i>

779
00:39:46.514 --> 00:39:49.299
<i>He says.
"I have the devil with them</i>

780
00:39:49.735 --> 00:39:51.476
<i>trying to make them practice."</i>

781
00:39:51.911 --> 00:39:54.217
<i>He said. "You practice
without me asking you."</i>

782
00:39:55.915 --> 00:39:57.525
<i>So he was gonna help me.</i>

783
00:39:57.873 --> 00:39:59.614
<i>But now. as far as me saying.</i>

784
00:39:59.788 --> 00:40:01.573
<i>"I am the greatest pitcher
in the world."</i>

785
00:40:02.095 --> 00:40:04.402
<i>I didn't say that.
It's other people saying it.</i>

786
00:40:06.926 --> 00:40:08.928
Bob M: <i>Once I became
an umpire in the leagues.</i>

787
00:40:09.102 --> 00:40:11.974
<i>I finally got my shot to go
behind the plate</i>

788
00:40:12.148 --> 00:40:15.064
<i>and call balls
and strikes for the legend.</i>

789
00:40:15.848 --> 00:40:18.372
<i>I had never seen a ball move
the way it did.</i>

790
00:40:19.112 --> 00:40:21.854
<i>I was stunned.
and so was the batter.</i>

791
00:40:22.028 --> 00:40:25.423
Satchel throw balls
that looked small.

792
00:40:25.597 --> 00:40:27.903
throw the small ball.
which is true.

793
00:40:28.077 --> 00:40:29.296
It'd be turning so fast.

794
00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:31.037
it looks smaller
than the regular ball.

795
00:40:31.429 --> 00:40:34.649
"Prince" Joe: <i>I weakly
grounded a ball back to him</i>

796
00:40:34.823 --> 00:40:37.043
and I felt
like I'd hit a home run.

797
00:40:37.609 --> 00:40:40.002
Just to know that I had made
contact with the ball.

798
00:40:40.916 --> 00:40:43.049
<i>Satchel Paige is.
without a doubt.</i>

799
00:40:43.266 --> 00:40:45.530
<i>the greatest pitcher
in Black baseball history.</i>

800
00:40:45.921 --> 00:40:50.230
<i>We can now show Satchel Paige's
strikeout rate per inning</i>

801
00:40:50.404 --> 00:40:52.537
<i>is very similar to Nolan Ryan's.</i>

802
00:40:52.711 --> 00:40:54.277
Bob F: <i>He would be
one of the top five</i>

803
00:40:54.452 --> 00:40:56.149
<i>or ten pitchers
in baseball history</i>

804
00:40:56.323 --> 00:40:58.238
<i>if he'd been in the big leagues
throughout his career.</i>

805
00:40:58.412 --> 00:41:00.588
But I saw him pitch
and he threw

806
00:41:00.762 --> 00:41:04.026
with very little effort
whatsoever. And the hitters say.

807
00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.767
"Well. you can't throw
the next one by me."

808
00:41:05.941 --> 00:41:07.290
Boom. There it goes.

809
00:41:07.595 --> 00:41:09.162
And. well. you're not going
to get that one by me.

810
00:41:09.336 --> 00:41:10.685
Oop. oop! There it goes.

811
00:41:11.991 --> 00:41:15.124
<i>He went out on that mound
and he looked up at the crowd.</i>

812
00:41:16.212 --> 00:41:18.606
He said. "Duty.
the sun is shining.

813
00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:21.043
but I'm gonna make them
think it's nighttime."

814
00:41:21.304 --> 00:41:24.699
<i>He struck out
21 of the 28 men he faced.</i>

815
00:41:25.091 --> 00:41:26.919
<i>We knew when we saw
Satchel Paige pitch.</i>

816
00:41:27.093 --> 00:41:29.008
when I saw Satchel Paige
and Satch could call in

817
00:41:29.182 --> 00:41:32.011
the whole team
and strike everybody out.

818
00:41:32.881 --> 00:41:35.144
You know. I saw that.
He'd call them all in.

819
00:41:35.623 --> 00:41:40.498
<i>Here he is. seven of us.
kneeling around the mound.</i>

820
00:41:41.107 --> 00:41:44.589
<i>He threw nine pitches.
and the side was out.</i>

821
00:41:45.459 --> 00:41:48.244
When he was in the backyard.
he just did amazing things.

822
00:41:48.462 --> 00:41:49.855
Like he'd say. "Look at that.

823
00:41:50.595 --> 00:41:52.858
Look at that berry hanging over
there on the bush.

824
00:41:53.032 --> 00:41:55.948
I bet I can hit it."
And I'd say. "No you can't."

825
00:41:56.122 --> 00:41:58.341
And he would pick up something and...

826
00:41:58.516 --> 00:42:00.126
...hit it and I would say.

827
00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:03.129
"Oh. wow!" You know.
that's what little children do.

828
00:42:03.303 --> 00:42:06.393
They don't think. well.
it was 55 feet away

829
00:42:06.567 --> 00:42:08.264
<i>and it was
the size of a quarter.</i>

830
00:42:08.613 --> 00:42:10.615
<i>You would have to be
a heck of a shot to make it.</i>

831
00:42:12.834 --> 00:42:15.271
<i>Before Gus Greenlee
hired Satchel.</i>

832
00:42:15.533 --> 00:42:18.057
<i>the initial Negro League.</i>

833
00:42:18.231 --> 00:42:19.972
<i>which was formed
by Rube Foster.</i>

834
00:42:20.146 --> 00:42:22.801
<i>had essentially fallen apart.</i>

835
00:42:22.975 --> 00:42:27.109
<i>So in 1933.
Greenlee and some others found</i>

836
00:42:27.283 --> 00:42:29.329
<i>the second
Negro National League.</i>

837
00:42:31.244 --> 00:42:33.681
<i>So they became
the Negro National League.</i>

838
00:42:33.855 --> 00:42:39.034
<i>But now it's all Eastern teams.
And in 1937. the Western teams</i>

839
00:42:39.208 --> 00:42:41.820
<i>organized the Negro American League.</i>

840
00:42:42.342 --> 00:42:44.257
<i>And so. Gus Greenlee</i>

841
00:42:44.431 --> 00:42:48.914
starts to bankroll
a bunch of new... ideas.

842
00:42:49.088 --> 00:42:51.438
<i>And one of those people</i>

843
00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:53.222
<i>talk about is the East-West game.</i>

844
00:42:53.396 --> 00:42:56.008
<i>And it was going to be
the premier event.</i>

845
00:42:56.530 --> 00:42:58.184
Gentleman Dave: <i>They picked
the best of the teams.</i>

846
00:42:58.358 --> 00:43:00.142
<i>players from the East</i>

847
00:43:00.403 --> 00:43:02.405
<i>and the best of the players
from the West.</i>

848
00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:04.973
<i>and they rented Comiskey Park.</i>

849
00:43:06.584 --> 00:43:13.068
<i>We started playing in 1933.
It was only 22.000 that year.</i>

850
00:43:13.503 --> 00:43:16.855
From that day on.
the crowd kept going and going.

851
00:43:17.551 --> 00:43:20.206
until the one time
we had 70.000.

852
00:43:20.902 --> 00:43:22.904
<i>People came

853

854
00:43:26.691 --> 00:43:30.433
<i>Duke Ellington. Lionel Hampton.

855
00:43:30.651 --> 00:43:33.785

857

858

859
00:43:41.662 --> 00:43:45.013

<i>All these great stars.

862
00:43:52.368 --> 00:43:55.937
Oh. man. you're talking

863
00:43:56.329 --> 00:43:58.157
<i>They start coming in

864
00:43:58.984 --> 00:44:00.463
<i>Didn't leave
until Monday morning.</i>

865
00:44:01.682 --> 00:44:04.685
<i>The real impact
of the East-West Classic</i>

866
00:44:04.859 --> 00:44:08.515
<i>was that White sportswriters
started to cover it.</i>

867
00:44:09.037 --> 00:44:12.432
<i>and once they did. some of them.
for the very first time.</i>

868
00:44:12.606 --> 00:44:15.565
<i>saw a kind of baseball
they had never seen before.</i>

869
00:44:16.392 --> 00:44:18.003
<i>where games were won...</i>

870
00:44:18.177 --> 00:44:20.962
<i>...not just with hitting.
but with base stealing.</i>

871
00:44:21.397 --> 00:44:24.009
<i>with these incredibly
acrobatic catches</i>

872
00:44:24.183 --> 00:44:27.403
<i>in the outfield.
with just a level of speed</i>

873
00:44:27.839 --> 00:44:29.754
<i>that they had never seen
in baseball.</i>

874
00:44:32.104 --> 00:44:34.280
And they started
to write about that.

875
00:44:34.672 --> 00:44:40.634
and the appeal that could have
for White fans. as well.

876
00:44:41.156 --> 00:44:44.290
<i>So the East-West classic
is having a big impact</i>

877
00:44:44.464 --> 00:44:47.162

944
00:47:37.767 --> 00:47:38.856
<i>was a White team.</i>

945
00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:43.512
<i>So they had us booked

946
00:47:43.904 --> 00:47:46.994
<i>See. Posey
was the traveling secretary.</i>

947
00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:50.258
<i>and he was very fair skinned.</i>

948
00:47:50.868 --> 00:47:52.782
So he went in.
and he got the rooms

949
00:47:52.957 --> 00:47:54.132
and everything.

950
00:47:55.002 --> 00:47:57.787
So they started
to unload the bus...

951
00:47:58.527 --> 00:48:01.095
...and when the players got off.

952
00:48:01.269 --> 00:48:04.359
they said. "Oh. no. no.
you can't stay here.

953
00:48:05.056 --> 00:48:07.058
This is a White hotel."

954

00:48:13.151 --> 00:48:15.936
<i>New Orleans. and whatnot.
they were very rare.</i>

957
00:48:16.545 --> 00:48:22.116
And usually the ballplayers
would find a rooming house.

958
00:48:22.290 --> 00:48:24.945
a Black rooming house
in the town.

959
00:48:25.163 --> 00:48:26.773
and that was where
they had to stay.

960
00:48:27.339 --> 00:48:28.818
<i>I can remember a town</i>

961
00:48:29.036 --> 00:48:33.040
<i>where we put up

962
00:48:33.475 --> 00:48:34.912
<i>When you turn on the lights.</i>

963
00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:38.611
<i>you see the bedbugs start
to go for cover.</i>

964
00:48:39.046 --> 00:48:40.439
You have to sleep
with the lights on

965
00:48:40.613 --> 00:48:41.788
because if you don't.

966
00:48:41.962 --> 00:48:43.398
those little gremlins
would come out

967
00:48:43.572 --> 00:48:44.922
and you wouldn't get
any sleep anyhow.

968
00:48:46.053 --> 00:48:47.446

00:48:49.796 --> 00:48:51.102
<i>They arrived at the park</i>

971
00:48:51.276 --> 00:48:52.842
and he said.
"Oh. I'm really tired.

972
00:48:53.017 --> 00:48:55.976
I want to hurry up and get
to bed and get some rest."

973
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:59.153
And the manager said.
"What bed? What do you mean.

974
00:48:59.327 --> 00:49:00.589
get to rest?

975
00:49:00.763 --> 00:49:02.678
We're staying here
in the ballpark."

976
00:49:02.852 --> 00:49:05.768
I mean. you... you had to sleep
on your suitcase

977
00:49:06.291 --> 00:49:07.770
in the ballpark.

978
00:49:08.771 --> 00:49:11.339
<i>We didn't stop much
because they wouldn't feed us</i>

979
00:49:11.513 --> 00:49:12.645
<i>in the restaurants.</i>

980
00:49:13.559 --> 00:49:15.430
<i>So we had to eat out
of paper sacks</i>

981
00:49:15.604 --> 00:49:17.084
<i>and go in a grocery store.</i>

982
00:49:17.302 --> 00:49:19.173
<i>We got one dollar
a day meal money.</i>

983
00:49:19.826 --> 00:49:21.828
and we would buy
one loaf of bread

984
00:49:22.568 --> 00:49:25.223
and we would buy a jar.
a big jar of peanut butter.

985
00:49:26.615 --> 00:49:30.271
That's what we lived off
of for three or four days.

986
00:49:30.837 --> 00:49:32.926
Peanut butter and bread.

987
00:49:34.101 --> 00:49:36.016
<i>Sometimes I'd wonder.
I'd talk. I'd say.</i>

988
00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:38.453
<i>"Well. how in the world
do they expect you to play ball</i>

989
00:49:38.714 --> 00:49:40.151

990
00:49:40.673 --> 00:49:42.501
<i>You haven't had a bed
to sleep in.</i>

991
00:49:42.675 --> 00:49:44.068
<i>You slept in a bus.</i>

992
00:49:44.807 --> 00:49:48.115
It wasn't healthy.
It wasn't comfortable at all.

993
00:49:49.595 --> 00:49:54.730
<i>How they could play two
and three games in two days</i>

994
00:49:54.992 --> 00:49:56.906
<i>is really a mystery.</i>

995
00:50:00.214 --> 00:50:02.042

1002
00:50:16.274 --> 00:50:18.232
Bob M: <i>It sounded
about perfect to me.</i>

1003
00:50:20.234 --> 00:50:21.583
<i>First.
I played in Puerto Rico.</i>

1004
00:50:21.757 --> 00:50:24.064
<i>then I played in Cuba.
and then Mexico.</i>

1005
00:50:24.499 --> 00:50:26.110
<i>It was a wonderful place
to play.</i>

1006
00:50:26.545 --> 00:50:28.025
They give you a chance
to go down there.

1007
00:50:28.199 --> 00:50:30.549
and the salaries
were a little better.

1008
00:50:32.029 --> 00:50:33.508
The crowds were better.

1009
00:50:34.074 --> 00:50:36.250
<i>The teams in those towns
were the kings of the towns.</i>

1010
00:50:36.424 --> 00:50:37.643
<i>it was like high school.</i>

1011
00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:39.079
You can say that

1012
00:50:39.253 --> 00:50:41.777
when the game was played
on weekends

1013
00:50:42.213 --> 00:50:43.866
and the whole town
was at the game.

1014
00:50:44.650 --> 00:50:48.654
<i>Fans were more like
football fans. you know.</i>

1015
00:50:48.828 --> 00:50:52.049
<i>"rah rah" cheering
and hit a home run</i>

1016
00:50:52.223 --> 00:50:55.008
<i>you'd take your cap around
and they'd put money in the cap.</i>

1017
00:50:55.313 --> 00:50:58.055
And they had a company
called Don Q Rum.

1018
00:50:58.403 --> 00:51:01.058
Every home run you hit.
you'd get a case of Don Q Rum.

1019
00:51:01.232 --> 00:51:03.103
you know?
So it was fun.

1020
00:51:06.019 --> 00:51:07.803
<i>There little kids
run behind you</i>

1021
00:51:07.977 --> 00:51:11.024
<i>and after the ball game.
they want your autograph</i>

1022
00:51:11.198 --> 00:51:14.332
<i>and it makes you feel
a part of something.</i>

1023
00:51:14.506 --> 00:51:18.597
<i>instead of being something
separate unto itself.</i>

1024
00:51:20.251 --> 00:51:22.079
But when you are out
of your own country.

1025
00:51:22.514 --> 00:51:25.995
and you find everything
so much better...

1026
00:51:27.258 --> 00:51:30.304
you know.
it's a revelation in a way.

1027
00:51:30.478 --> 00:51:31.740
if you never experienced it.

1028
00:51:32.915 --> 00:51:36.136
<i>But it's like heaven. you know?</i>

1029
00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:38.530
<i>I want to go back. you know.
I got to go back there.</i>

1030
00:51:38.704 --> 00:51:39.835
<i>I got to go back there.</i>

1031
00:51:42.664 --> 00:51:44.666
<i>There was
very little discrimination.</i>

1032
00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:47.016
<i>So you felt. you know. free.</i>

1033
00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:49.149
<i>The fact that. you know.</i>

1034
00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:51.151
<i>you were accepted
for your ability.</i>

1035
00:51:51.325 --> 00:51:52.979
<i>not from the color of your skin.</i>

1036
00:51:53.545 --> 00:51:55.199
<i>and that really
made you feel great.</i>

1037
00:51:59.551 --> 00:52:01.292
<i>I think
from the very beginning.</i>

1038
00:52:01.596 --> 00:52:05.426
<i>there was a sense of a kind
of a solidarity or connection</i>

1039
00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:08.821
between Black players here
and Latin players.

1040
00:52:08.995 --> 00:52:10.127
dark Latin players.

1041
00:52:10.518 --> 00:52:11.998
<i>So in some ways.</i>

1042
00:52:12.172 --> 00:52:14.783
<i>baseball generated
a kind of diaspora.</i>

1043
00:52:14.957 --> 00:52:17.264
<i>'cause these Black Latin players</i>

1044
00:52:17.438 --> 00:52:19.136
<i>could not play
Major League Baseball either.</i>

1045
00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:20.833
<i>They had to play
in the Negro Leagues</i>

1046
00:52:21.007 --> 00:52:22.878
<i>that they were playing
in the United States.</i>

1047
00:52:23.879 --> 00:52:27.056
<i>And so Martín Dihigo
and José Méndez.</i>

1048
00:52:27.231 --> 00:52:29.189
<i>Cristóbal Torriente.</i>

1049
00:52:29.668 --> 00:52:32.888
the game was just full
of Latino ballplayers.

1050
00:52:34.238 --> 00:52:36.762
<i>Negro Leagues
was a rainbow coalition</i>

1051
00:52:37.545 --> 00:52:38.938
<i>of players of color.</i>

1052
00:52:39.330 --> 00:52:41.114
everything from chalk
to charcoal.

1053
00:52:41.549 --> 00:52:42.942
That was the pigmentation

1054
00:52:43.116 --> 00:52:44.335
<i>that played
in the Negro Leagues.</i>

1055
00:52:51.951 --> 00:52:54.649
News reporter: <i>Millions enjoy
a great year in American sports.</i>

1056
00:52:54.823 --> 00:52:56.303
<i>But Dizzy and Daffy Dean.</i>

1057
00:52:56.477 --> 00:52:58.871
<i>the Cardinal Ace's
new national heroes.</i>

1058
00:53:00.829 --> 00:53:03.354
<i>Dizzy Dean
pretty much saved baseball</i>

1059
00:53:03.528 --> 00:53:04.833
<i>during the Depression.</i>

1060
00:53:05.225 --> 00:53:08.707
Babe Ruth was kind of fading out
for the Depression 1934.

1061
00:53:08.968 --> 00:53:10.970
<i>and him and his brother
come in with the Cardinals.</i>

1062
00:53:11.144 --> 00:53:12.537
<i>They win the pennant.</i>

1063
00:53:12.754 --> 00:53:14.147
<i>and then they go
to the World Series.</i>

1064
00:53:14.321 --> 00:53:16.062
<i>So they're like
on top of the world.</i>

1065
00:53:16.236 --> 00:53:19.457
And they could have gone home.
but they were gonna barnstorm.

1066
00:53:19.674 --> 00:53:22.851
And so they played
in that particular year. 1934.

1067
00:53:23.025 --> 00:53:25.463
<i>They play six games
against Kansas City Monarchs.</i>

1068
00:53:25.767 --> 00:53:27.769
<i>two against
the Philadelphia Stars.</i>

1069
00:53:28.030 --> 00:53:30.032
<i>three against
the Pittsburgh Crawfords.</i>

1070
00:53:30.294 --> 00:53:32.383
<i>and two against
the New York Black Yankees.</i>

1071
00:53:32.557 --> 00:53:34.298
<i>And they tour all the way
across the country.</i>

1072
00:53:36.256 --> 00:53:38.084
<i>But people didn't.
hadn't seen Blacks</i>

1073
00:53:38.258 --> 00:53:41.957
<i>and Major League All-Star teams
mix too much in those days.</i>

1074
00:53:42.567 --> 00:53:46.048
<i>So we always had large crowds.
I think we played ten games.</i>

1075
00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:47.876
<i>We played against</i>

1076
00:53:48.050 --> 00:53:49.965
<i>Dizzy Dean and his brother
in Cleveland.</i>

1077
00:53:50.227 --> 00:53:51.880
<i>and they had a sellout crowd. And...</i>

1078
00:53:52.838 --> 00:53:55.232
<i>Satchel beat Dizzy two-one
in 12 innings.</i>

1079
00:53:55.928 --> 00:53:59.801
Bob K: <i>The record books bear out
that the Black teams</i>

1080
00:53:59.975 --> 00:54:03.022
<i>won the majority
of those head-to-head matchups.</i>

1081
00:54:03.196 --> 00:54:06.155
<i>What that tells me. number one.
is there was no doubt</i>

1082
00:54:06.591 --> 00:54:08.767
<i>in the minds
of those Major League athletes</i>

1083
00:54:08.941 --> 00:54:10.247
that these guys could play.

1084
00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:12.553
<i>Now.</i>

1085
00:54:12.988 --> 00:54:14.773
<i>we knew that we could play
baseball with anybody.</i>

1086
00:54:15.077 --> 00:54:17.210
<i>If you've got Satchel
on your team.</i>

1087
00:54:17.384 --> 00:54:21.170
<i>you can play our teams
that got nine devils on it.</i>

1088
00:54:21.475 --> 00:54:23.216
<i>Somebody asked
Dizzy Dean. they said.</i>

1089
00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:25.131
"Who's the greatest pitcher
you ever saw?"

1090
00:54:25.305 --> 00:54:27.873
And Dizzy Dean was known
to be a little conceited.

1091
00:54:28.134 --> 00:54:30.484
and they figured he's gonna
start talking about himself.

1092
00:54:30.745 --> 00:54:32.181
He said. and he told them

1093
00:54:32.617 --> 00:54:33.705
that the greatest pitcher
he ever saw was a Colored boy

1094
00:54:33.879 --> 00:54:35.315
named Satchel Paige.

1095
00:54:35.576 --> 00:54:37.230
He said. "If you can get him
and me on the same team.

1096
00:54:37.404 --> 00:54:39.624
we could win the pennant
by the 4th of July

1097
00:54:39.798 --> 00:54:41.626
and go fishing
until the World Series started."

1098
00:54:43.802 --> 00:54:45.847
<i>I remember
we were playing in California</i>

1099
00:54:46.021 --> 00:54:47.414
<i>in the winter league.</i>

1100
00:54:47.632 --> 00:54:49.242
<i>and I was with
Satchel Paige's All-Stars.</i>

1101
00:54:49.808 --> 00:54:52.463
<i>And we were playing
the Major Leagues All-Stars.</i>

1102
00:54:52.811 --> 00:54:54.421
<i>And we played three Sundays.</i>

1103
00:54:54.682 --> 00:54:56.510
And then Judge Landis.
who was the commissioner

1104
00:54:56.684 --> 00:54:57.990
at that time.

1105
00:54:58.382 --> 00:54:59.992
sent a telegram out
and told the Major Leaguers

1106
00:55:00.166 --> 00:55:01.646
not to play us any more

1107
00:55:02.037 --> 00:55:04.823
because they had everything
to lose and nothing to gain.

1108
00:55:05.171 --> 00:55:07.434
We had everything to gain
and nothing to lose.

1109
00:55:08.043 --> 00:55:12.918
I can only be for the best team
in each league to win a pennant.

1110
00:55:13.397 --> 00:55:18.271
But to you fans. no heartaches
and not even a grouch.

1111
00:55:18.489 --> 00:55:19.794
May you all win.

1112
00:55:20.665 --> 00:55:22.319
<i>Kenesaw Mountain Landis</i>

1113
00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:24.321
<i>is brought in as the first
commissioner of baseball</i>

1114
00:55:24.495 --> 00:55:27.062
<i>after the Black Sox scandal
of 1919.</i>

1115
00:55:27.759 --> 00:55:30.065
<i>which was the throwing
of the World Series.</i>

1116
00:55:30.849 --> 00:55:33.982
<i>So the owners give
Kenesaw Mountain Landis</i>

1117
00:55:34.156 --> 00:55:36.463
<i>essentially almost
dictatorial powers.</i>

1118
00:55:36.898 --> 00:55:39.161
because they needed to clean up
the image of baseball

1119
00:55:39.336 --> 00:55:40.685
after the Black Sox scandal.

1120
00:55:41.729 --> 00:55:45.603
<i>Whatever views Landis had.
we know that by his actions.</i>

1121
00:55:45.777 --> 00:55:50.347
<i>he maintained segregation
in Major League Baseball</i>

1122
00:55:50.608 --> 00:55:53.567
<i>far longer than it needed
to be maintained.</i>

1123
00:55:54.655 --> 00:55:59.791
Landis will soon prevent teams
of Major Leaguers

1124
00:55:59.965 --> 00:56:03.011
from barnstorming against teams
of Negro Leaguers

1125
00:56:03.229 --> 00:56:04.361
because he doesn't want

1126
00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:07.842
intact Major League teams
being defeated.

1127
00:56:08.190 --> 00:56:12.630
Whatever he says about.
"Oh. there's no law.

1128
00:56:12.847 --> 00:56:15.633
There's no rule
against integration."

1129
00:56:15.894 --> 00:56:22.291
The reality is. at every step.
he did nothing but block it.

1137
00:56:49.057 --> 00:56:53.192
and that's when the relationship
between him and Gus Greenlee

1138
00:56:53.366 --> 00:56:54.323
becomes...

1139
00:56:55.716 --> 00:56:57.457
strained.

1140
00:56:57.762 --> 00:57:01.156
<i>By 1937. he had put in

<i>for Gus Greenlee.</i>

1142
00:57:03.028 --> 00:57:05.683
He was back with the Crawfords.
and all of a sudden.

1143
00:57:05.944 --> 00:57:10.601
these guys start
hanging around the stadium.

1144
00:57:11.079 --> 00:57:13.734
<i>and it turns out
that they were emissaries</i>

1145

1146

<i>Trujillo.</i>

1147
00:57:19.523 --> 00:57:22.613

1148

<i>to offer Satchel Paige</i>

1149
00:57:24.745 --> 00:57:27.052
to play for him.
and then also carte blanche

1150
00:57:27.226 --> 00:57:30.316
to then bring as many players
as he could bring with him.

1151
00:57:31.273 --> 00:57:33.580
<i>Paige then was able
to reach out</i>

1152
00:57:33.754 --> 00:57:36.540
<i>to other star
Negro League players.</i>

1153
00:57:36.714 --> 00:57:38.585
<i>particularly those
on the Crawfords.</i>

1154
00:57:38.759 --> 00:57:42.110
"And yeah. I'll go with you.
Sure. For what? How much money?

1155
00:57:42.284 --> 00:57:45.723
Pay me a couple thousand.
Oh. yeah. right. I'm coming."

1156
00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:51.337
<i>Paige brought in a total
of nine Pittsburgh Crawfords</i>

1157
00:57:51.511 --> 00:57:53.252
<i>from a roster of 16.</i>

1158
00:57:54.035 --> 00:57:56.603
But it destroyed
the Pittsburgh Crawfords

1159
00:57:56.777 --> 00:57:59.084

their best players.

1160
00:58:00.781 --> 00:58:03.088
<i>By 1938. they were history.</i>

1161
00:58:04.742 --> 00:58:08.180
<i>It was too bad because Greenlee
did a great deal</i>

1162

<i>for Black baseball.</i>

1163
00:58:10.530 --> 00:58:11.923
<i>So at that point.</i>

1164
00:58:12.097 --> 00:58:13.881

1166
00:58:16.101 --> 00:58:18.190
<i>started stealing
some of the players back.</i>

1167
00:58:18.364 --> 00:58:20.409
<i>And then you had the makings of.</i>

1168
00:58:20.627 --> 00:58:23.587
really. the last great
Negro League dynasty.

1169
00:58:24.022 --> 00:58:26.372
which was the Homestead Grays.

1170
00:58:26.677 --> 00:58:29.418
<i>And they made it
to five of the last</i>

<i>Negro League World Series</i>

1172
00:58:31.246 --> 00:58:32.596

News reporter:
<i>The stakes this time</i>

1174
00:58:45.565 --> 00:58:47.828
<i>are the greatest men

1175
00:58:48.002 --> 00:58:51.484
<i>And what are the stakes?
The American state.</i>

1176
00:58:52.485 --> 00:58:54.661
<i>The liberty of the whole earth</i>

1177
00:58:54.879 --> 00:58:57.403

Bob M: <i>Following the US entry
into World War II.</i>

1179
00:59:05.629 --> 00:59:08.066
<i>African Americans once again
embraced the opportunity</i>

1180
00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:09.633
<i>to fight for their country.</i>

1181
00:59:10.155 --> 00:59:12.679
<i>Close to 120
Negro League ballplayers</i>

1182
00:59:12.853 --> 00:59:14.333
<i>joined in the war effort.</i>

1183
00:59:16.335 --> 00:59:20.034
<i>In the spring of 1943.
I enlisted as a member</i>

1184
00:59:20.208 --> 00:59:21.732
<i>of the United States
Marine Corps.</i>

1185
00:59:23.124 --> 00:59:24.473
<i>I was one
of the first Black Marines</i>

1186
00:59:24.648 --> 00:59:25.997
<i>in the history of this country.</i>

1187
00:59:27.607 --> 00:59:30.131
<i>Black soldiers were always put
on the front lines.</i>

1188
00:59:30.305 --> 00:59:33.961
<i>used as pawns to pave the way
for the White soldiers.</i>

1189
00:59:35.136 --> 00:59:38.487
<i>On the battlefields
of Okinawa. Saipan. and Guam.</i>

1190
00:59:38.749 --> 00:59:41.142
<i>I would endure
many harrowing experiences.</i>

1191
00:59:42.056 --> 00:59:43.884
<i>More than half
of my company was killed.</i>

1192
00:59:44.885 --> 00:59:47.366
<i>There were so many
dead bodies lying around.</i>

1193
00:59:47.584 --> 00:59:49.194
<i>they could have covered
the playing field</i>

1194
00:59:49.368 --> 00:59:51.544
<i>of any Major League ballpark
with the corpses.</i>

1195
00:59:53.198 --> 00:59:55.853
<i>I had given America
two and a half years of service.</i>

1196
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:58.072
<i>and the country still
had not granted</i>

1197
00:59:58.246 --> 01:00:00.945
<i>full rights to me
or my Black brothers.</i>

1198
01:00:03.251 --> 01:00:04.862
<i>It was a huge contradiction</i>

1199
01:00:05.036 --> 01:00:06.951
<i>that Americans were fighting
this war effort</i>

1200
01:00:07.125 --> 01:00:11.303
<i>on behalf of civil rights
and liberties for people abroad.</i>

1201
01:00:11.477 --> 01:00:13.261
<i>And Black people understood</i>

1202
01:00:13.435 --> 01:00:15.481
<i>that they were still
second class citizens at home.</i>

1203
01:00:16.351 --> 01:00:19.703
And I think Black people
took that as an opportunity

1204
01:00:19.877 --> 01:00:21.182
to start pushing for more.

1205
01:00:23.445 --> 01:00:25.012
<i>The Double V campaign</i>

1206
01:00:25.186 --> 01:00:26.274
<i>was started
by the</i> Pittsburgh Courier.

1207
01:00:27.101 --> 01:00:30.322
<i>The</i> Courier <i>rallied
Black opinion</i>

1208
01:00:30.496 --> 01:00:31.889
<i>around the country.</i>

1209
01:00:32.237 --> 01:00:35.066
<i>around the idea
of "We will support this war.</i>

1210
01:00:35.457 --> 01:00:38.286
<i>We will enlist to fight.</i>

1211
01:00:38.765 --> 01:00:41.681
<i>We will buy war bonds
and support the war.</i>

1212
01:00:41.855 --> 01:00:45.729
We will be patriotic.
but we want it understood.

1213
01:00:46.555 --> 01:00:49.384
that when the war is over.
we are going to get our rights."

1214
01:00:50.168 --> 01:00:52.866
<i>And this is what they call
the Double Victory campaign.</i>

1215
01:00:53.084 --> 01:00:59.525
<i>The idea of having
to fight two wars. one overseas.</i>

1216
01:00:59.699 --> 01:01:02.920
<i>and more importantly. one here
at home against segregation.</i>

1217
01:01:03.137 --> 01:01:05.400
And in that discussion
comes one of. I think.

1218
01:01:05.574 --> 01:01:08.665
one of the most powerful images
and stories that comes out

1219
01:01:08.839 --> 01:01:10.971
is the idea they can fight.

1220
01:01:11.276 --> 01:01:13.582
and go. and fight.
and die at Guadalcanal.

1221
01:01:13.757 --> 01:01:15.672
but they can't play
on a diamond together?

1222
01:01:17.978 --> 01:01:19.327
<i>At the time.</i>

1223
01:01:19.588 --> 01:01:21.373
<i>baseball was America's
most important sport.</i>

1224
01:01:21.547 --> 01:01:23.636
<i>and so integrating that</i>

1225
01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:27.074
<i>they felt symbolically
would be such a major step</i>

1226
01:01:27.248 --> 01:01:29.729
<i>to see Black people
and White people</i>

1227
01:01:29.903 --> 01:01:31.688
working together
on the same team

1228
01:01:31.862 --> 01:01:34.516
to achieve a common goal
of winning a game.

1229
01:01:35.082 --> 01:01:36.475
<i>I was involved</i>

1230
01:01:36.649 --> 01:01:38.390
<i>in an organization
of young people</i>

1231
01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:40.435
<i>interested in breaking</i>

1232
01:01:40.609 --> 01:01:42.742
<i>the Jim Crow ban
in the big leagues.</i>

1233
01:01:43.264 --> 01:01:46.180
<i>We used to go collect signatures</i>

1234
01:01:46.354 --> 01:01:50.228
<i>from the fans
coming into Forbes Field</i>

1235
01:01:50.576 --> 01:01:55.494
that we want to have Negroes
get into the big leagues.

1236
01:01:55.668 --> 01:01:57.365
<i>and there were lots of petitions</i>

1237
01:01:57.539 --> 01:02:00.238
<i>like we were making
in Pittsburgh. in New York.</i>

1238
01:02:00.455 --> 01:02:01.805
<i>Many. many petitions</i>

1239
01:02:01.979 --> 01:02:04.590
<i>were gathered
at the Yankee Stadium.</i>

1240
01:02:04.764 --> 01:02:08.246
The owners knew
that this has got to change.

1241
01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:10.683
Bob K: <i>Now. the Black press</i>

1242
01:02:11.031 --> 01:02:15.557
<i>was pushing this agenda
all along. Sam Lacy. Faye Young.</i>

1243
01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:17.472
There were other
great Black writers

1244
01:02:17.646 --> 01:02:21.825
who were all trying to alter
the course of baseball

1245
01:02:21.999 --> 01:02:25.045
and move Black folks
into Major League Baseball.

1246
01:02:25.698 --> 01:02:27.004
<i>But Wendell Smith.</i>

1247
01:02:27.526 --> 01:02:30.659
<i>one of the great Black writers
of that era.</i>

1248
01:02:30.834 --> 01:02:33.227
<i>was really
its primary front man.</i>

1249
01:02:35.012 --> 01:02:36.578
<i>Wendell Smith
started writing</i>

1250
01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:39.538
<i>this whole series of stories
about the issue.</i>

1251
01:02:40.017 --> 01:02:44.369
<i>And so. when teams came to play
in Pittsburgh at Forbes Field.</i>

1252
01:02:44.543 --> 01:02:47.415
<i>he would park himself
at the Schenley Hotel</i>

1253
01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:49.287
<i>across the street
from the ballpark</i>

1254
01:02:49.461 --> 01:02:53.900
<i>and buttonhole the top managers
and coaches and players and say.</i>

1255
01:02:54.074 --> 01:02:57.121
<i>"Are you in favor of integrating
the Major Leagues?"</i>

1256
01:02:57.295 --> 01:02:58.949
<i>And he got all of these top.</i>

1257
01:02:59.123 --> 01:03:01.473
<i>well-known people
on the record saying "Yes."</i>

1258
01:03:01.908 --> 01:03:04.432
And then he and other
sportswriters used

1259
01:03:04.606 --> 01:03:07.044
some of that data
to start pressuring

1260
01:03:07.218 --> 01:03:09.046
<i>the Commissioner Landis</i>

1261
01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:12.092
<i>to consider the integration
of Major League Baseball.</i>

1262
01:03:12.266 --> 01:03:14.573
<i>And he had been dodging
the whole issue</i>

1263
01:03:14.747 --> 01:03:16.880
<i>for a couple of decades.</i>

1264
01:03:17.054 --> 01:03:23.669
<i>In December 1943.
leaders of the Black newspapers</i>

1265
01:03:23.887 --> 01:03:27.455
met with the commissioner
of baseball

1266
01:03:28.152 --> 01:03:32.460
and the owners of baseball

1267
01:03:33.026 --> 01:03:35.637
<i>about getting Blacks
into the big leagues.</i>

1268
01:03:35.855 --> 01:03:40.338
<i>And they selected Paul Robeson
to be the spokesman</i>

1269
01:03:40.512 --> 01:03:42.644
<i>of the delegation here
in New York.</i>

1270
01:03:50.217 --> 01:03:54.613
Paul Jr: <i>Dad was then a great
theatrical star. film star.</i>

1271
01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:58.182
<i>the leading concert artist
in the country and in the world.</i>

1272
01:03:58.878 --> 01:04:00.358
So my father's attitude was. especially.

1273
01:04:00.532 --> 01:04:01.838
because I've reached
this pinnacle.

1274
01:04:02.012 --> 01:04:03.404
because I'm who I am...

1275
01:04:04.971 --> 01:04:07.321
I have to do whatever I can do

1276
01:04:07.495 --> 01:04:10.803
to advance the interests
of African Americans as a whole.

1277
01:04:10.977 --> 01:04:12.326
<i>And in this case.</i>

1278
01:04:12.761 --> 01:04:15.590
<i>what better way than to throw
my weight behind the campaign</i>

1279
01:04:15.808 --> 01:04:17.418
<i>to break the segregation</i>

1280
01:04:17.592 --> 01:04:20.160
<i>in organized baseball
in particular.</i>

1281
01:04:21.379 --> 01:04:22.946
<i>So Paul explained</i>

1282
01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:25.774
<i>to the commissioner
and to the others.</i>

1283
01:04:25.949 --> 01:04:29.604
<i>"We have a million Blacks
in the armed forces.</i>

1284
01:04:29.909 --> 01:04:32.607
and now. right during this war.

1285
01:04:32.912 --> 01:04:37.221
they... You still have this ban
against them in what sport?

1286
01:04:37.395 --> 01:04:38.657
The national sport.

1287
01:04:39.223 --> 01:04:42.487
<i>How does that fit in
with what we're fighting for?"</i>

1288
01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:44.489
Voice as Paul Sr:
<i>We live in times</i>

1289
01:04:44.663 --> 01:04:47.100
<i>when the world
is changing very fast.</i>

1290

<i>but of the whole world.</i>

1293
01:04:54.673 --> 01:04:56.631
<i>Because a thing like this...</i>

1294
01:04:56.893 --> 01:04:58.546
<i>...Negro ballplayers becoming</i>

1295
01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:01.027
<i>a part of the great
national pastime of America...</i>

1296
01:05:02.072 --> 01:05:03.464
<i>can make a great difference</i>

1297
01:05:03.638 --> 01:05:04.901

1300
01:05:11.603 --> 01:05:15.215
Paul Jr: <i>He made about a ten.
12-minute presentation.</i>

1301
01:05:15.389 --> 01:05:18.784
which was quite impassioned.
It was off-the-cuff

1302
01:05:19.002 --> 01:05:21.656
and really had
an enormous effect

1303
01:05:21.830 --> 01:05:24.224
on the owners.
apparently because unusual.

1304
01:05:24.398 --> 01:05:27.097
they applauded at the end
and all that.

1305
01:05:27.619 --> 01:05:29.534
And then of course.
everybody withdrew.

1306
01:05:29.708 --> 01:05:33.277
and they went back
into private session.

1307

<i>"Are we going to discuss

<i>on the proposal to integrate

1311
01:05:44.810 --> 01:05:46.551
<i>And Landis said.</i>

1312
01:05:46.725 --> 01:05:49.293
<i>"We have considered it.
No action has been taken."</i>

1313
01:05:51.469 --> 01:05:54.428
<i>He said. "It is a matter

<i>whether or not to sign
a Black player."</i>

1315
01:05:57.344 --> 01:06:00.130
But as long
as he is the commissioner.

1316
01:06:00.391 --> 01:06:04.482
there will not be any player

01:07:45.626 --> 01:07:47.889
<i>this is the heyday

1354
01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:49.587
Because of World War II.

1355
01:07:49.804 --> 01:07:51.632
there's money pouring
into the Black community. right?

1356
01:07:51.806 --> 01:07:53.156
<i>Like defense hiring.</i>

1357

1360
01:07:58.596 --> 01:08:02.208
So now. Black people
in the general community

1361
01:08:02.382 --> 01:08:03.949
have more money to go
to baseball games

1362
01:08:04.123 --> 01:08:05.864
and to support
these institutions.

1363
01:08:06.604 --> 01:08:09.607
<i>So by the late '30s

1364
01:08:09.824 --> 01:08:12.827

1370
01:08:24.404 --> 01:08:26.058

Bob K: <i>The impact that it had
on urban communities</i>

1372
01:08:30.497 --> 01:08:34.632

1373

<i>since the Negro Leagues.</i>

1374
01:08:36.286 --> 01:08:37.983
So when we think
about Black baseball

1375
01:08:38.157 --> 01:08:41.421

like Chicago.

1376

1378
01:08:47.819 --> 01:08:51.257

01:08:56.219 --> 01:08:59.396

<i>The ballplayers.

1389
01:09:16.804 --> 01:09:18.893
<i>I realized it
was the most important word</i>

1390
01:09:19.067 --> 01:09:21.679
<i>in their vocabulary.
and the word is "satisfied."</i>

1391

1410
01:10:04.374 --> 01:10:08.421
<i>There's questions of like.
"Was Effa Black? Was Effa White?</i>

1411

you couldn't see
a Black employee in the store.

1427
01:10:51.508 --> 01:10:53.858
<i>So she decides
to launch a boycott</i>

1428

<i>It worked.

that she is savvy.

1444

<i>Little by little.</i>

1446

<i>I drew up the schedules.
bought the equipment.</i>

1448

<i>went to all of the meetings.

1449
01:12:21.989 --> 01:12:24.252

Bob K:
<i>She was a shrewd negotiator.</i>

1452
01:12:29.301 --> 01:12:32.957
She knew the business
of baseball as well as any man.

1453
01:12:33.261 --> 01:12:35.307
and Monte Irvin
was fond of saying.

1454

"She never missed a payday."

1455
01:12:37.614 --> 01:12:39.180
You had a lot of respect

you know. tried to.

1457
01:12:42.401 --> 01:12:43.576
particularly young fellas.

1458
01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:45.056
She'd try to advise them
what to do.

1459
01:12:45.230 --> 01:12:46.623
how to do it
and that kind of a thing.

1460
01:12:46.797 --> 01:12:48.320
<i>But I think
it was her ability</i>

1461
01:12:48.494 --> 01:12:50.583
<i>and her characteristics

1462
01:12:50.757 --> 01:12:53.412
and what she wanted
the League to look like

1463
01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:56.110
that made her a presence

1464
01:12:56.284 --> 01:12:59.505
in the Negro League situation.
you know? Very important. Yeah.

1465
01:13:05.424 --> 01:13:08.688
<i>For many years in the '40s.

1489

01:14:10.837 --> 01:14:12.622
<i>and were on the verge
of winning.</i>

1495
01:14:12.796 --> 01:14:15.842
<i>The Eagles won a slugfest
in the sixth game to tie it up.</i>

1496
01:14:16.016 --> 01:14:17.409
<i>So they're back
at Rupert Stadium</i>

1497
01:14:17.583 --> 01:14:18.715
<i>for the seventh game.</i>

1498
01:14:19.498 --> 01:14:20.760
<i>And he gets to the ninth inning.</i>

1499
01:14:20.934 --> 01:14:22.545
The Eagles are ahead.
three to two.

1500
01:14:22.893 --> 01:14:25.330
<i>Monarchs last chance.
First guy makes an out.</i>

1501
01:14:25.504 --> 01:14:26.766
<i>the second guy singles.</i>

1502
01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:28.376
<i>but he's thrown out at second.</i>

1503
01:14:28.551 --> 01:14:30.378
<i>trying to stretch it
into a double.</i>

1504
01:14:30.553 --> 01:14:31.858
<i>So now there are two outs.</i>

1505
01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:35.296
<i>and Effa Manley is just
as nervous as a cat</i>

1506
01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:36.907
<i>because the next guy gets a hit.</i>

1507
01:14:37.995 --> 01:14:39.866
<i>She's something
like in her memoirs.</i>

1508
01:14:40.171 --> 01:14:43.087
<i>"How can a human heart
take all this tension?"</i>

1509
01:14:43.261 --> 01:14:44.741
<i>She says. "I can't look.</i>

1510
01:14:44.915 --> 01:14:46.960
I hear the crack of the bat
and I can't look.

1511
01:14:47.134 --> 01:14:48.571
I finally opened my eyes.

1512
01:14:49.267 --> 01:14:50.703
<i>and the ball is coming
right down</i>

1513
01:14:50.877 --> 01:14:52.139
<i>in first baseman
Lennie Pearson's mitt."</i>

1514
01:14:52.313 --> 01:14:54.881
<i>He grabs it. The Eagles win.</i>

1515
01:14:57.362 --> 01:15:01.018
<i>Boy. did we have
a ballclub in 1946.[chuckling]</i>

1516
01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:03.063
<i>I don't believe</i>

1517
01:15:03.455 --> 01:15:05.283
<i>any ballclub in the country
could have beaten us.</i>

1518
01:15:10.506 --> 01:15:11.637
<i>I'm in the Navy.</i>

1519
01:15:12.116 --> 01:15:14.988
<i>I'm a boatswain.
stevedore platoon.</i>

1520
01:15:15.162 --> 01:15:16.860
<i>It's an all Black battalion.</i>

1521
01:15:17.817 --> 01:15:19.210
It's 10:30 at night.

1522
01:15:19.384 --> 01:15:22.169
Everybody's in bed.
and the officer said.

1523
01:15:22.343 --> 01:15:23.997
the officer of the day.

1524
01:15:24.955 --> 01:15:26.870
"Boatswain O'Neil.
come to my office at once."

1525
01:15:27.044 --> 01:15:29.002
I say. "Oh. hell.
what did I do now?"

1526
01:15:29.176 --> 01:15:30.961
He said. "You know what?"
I say. "No. sir."

1527
01:15:32.179 --> 01:15:33.920
"Branch Rickey
just signed Jackie

1528
01:15:34.094 --> 01:15:36.314
to an organized
baseball contract."

1529
01:15:36.575 --> 01:15:39.622
I say. "Whoop.
give me that horn."

1530
01:15:39.839 --> 01:15:41.188
I got on it.

1531
01:15:41.362 --> 01:15:43.495
I say. "Hear this.
hear this. hear this."

1532
01:15:43.756 --> 01:15:45.715
Woke up the entire camp.

1533
01:15:46.585 --> 01:15:49.066
And I said. "Branch Rickey
just signed Jackie Robinson

1534
01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:51.198
to an organized
baseball contract."

1535
01:15:51.416 --> 01:15:53.549
They whoop. they holler.
they shot their guns.

1536
01:15:53.897 --> 01:15:57.422
We didn't sleep much that night.
Oh. man. That was it.

1537
01:15:58.554 --> 01:15:59.990
I came out of the service.

1538
01:16:00.164 --> 01:16:02.383
I joined a baseball team.
In a year or so.

1539
01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:05.256
I was with
the organized baseball.

1540
01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:06.779
and in a very short time.

1541
01:16:06.953 --> 01:16:08.694
<i>I was up there
in the Major Leagues.</i>

1542
01:16:08.912 --> 01:16:10.870
<i>Boy. I was a pretty lucky fellow
because we do pretty well</i>

1543
01:16:11.044 --> 01:16:12.480
<i>in the Major League
in baseball.</i>

1544
01:16:14.091 --> 01:16:19.052
<i>♪ I got a good thing
A good thing going on ♪</i>

1545
01:16:21.054 --> 01:16:26.190
<i>♪ I got a good thing
A good thing going on ♪</i>

1546
01:16:27.104 --> 01:16:30.063
<i>♪ Woke up this mornin'
It's a brand-new day ♪</i>

1547
01:16:30.324 --> 01:16:32.718

1548
01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:39.116
<i>♪ 'Cause I got a good thing
A good thing going on ♪</i>

1549
01:16:42.249 --> 01:16:45.992
<i>Jackie Robinson had been
this incredible athlete at UCLA.</i>

1550
01:16:46.166 --> 01:16:48.125
<i>and he was known
across the country</i>

1551
01:16:48.299 --> 01:16:49.866
<i>as this football star.</i>

1552
01:16:50.127 --> 01:16:51.694
<i>but there was no avenue
for him to play football.</i>

1553
01:16:51.868 --> 01:16:54.697
And so. baseball really became
the best outlet for him

1554
01:16:54.871 --> 01:16:57.482
to be a professional athlete
to make money.

1555
01:16:57.830 --> 01:17:00.920
And that door opened for him
through the Negro Leagues.

1556
01:17:01.094 --> 01:17:02.356
<i>through the Kansas City Monarchs.</i>

1557
01:17:02.748 --> 01:17:04.315
<i>At the time.</i>

1558
01:17:04.489 --> 01:17:07.361
<i>Wendell Smith decided
that Jackie Robinson</i>

1559
01:17:07.535 --> 01:17:10.756
was the player
that had the best odds

1560
01:17:10.930 --> 01:17:12.802
of breaking through
into the Major Leagues

1561
01:17:12.976 --> 01:17:14.455
because he had
the right temperament.

1562
01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:15.979
<i>and he had the right look</i>

1563
01:17:16.414 --> 01:17:18.764
<i>that would be accepted
by White fans.</i>

1564
01:17:18.938 --> 01:17:20.897
<i>So it was actually Wendell Smith</i>

1565
01:17:21.071 --> 01:17:24.988
<i>who put Jackie Robinson
on Branch Rickey's radar screen.</i>

1566
01:17:28.208 --> 01:17:29.688
<i>Organized baseball</i>

1567
01:17:29.862 --> 01:17:31.690
<i>hasn't had a Negro player
since 1884.</i>

1568
01:17:31.864 --> 01:17:33.518
<i>when Moses Walker
was with Toledo.</i>

1569
01:17:33.692 --> 01:17:36.956
<i>But 63 years later. in 1947.</i>

1570
01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:39.132
<i>Jackie Robinson
joined the Brooklyn Dodgers</i>

1571
01:17:39.306 --> 01:17:40.612
<i>and blasted his way to stardom.</i>

1572
01:17:42.570 --> 01:17:44.398
Bob M: <i>We never thought
we'd lived to see the day</i>

1573
01:17:44.572 --> 01:17:46.487
<i>when a Black man would be
admitted into the Major Leagues.</i>

1574
01:17:47.184 --> 01:17:49.142
<i>Equality was within our reach.</i>

1575
01:17:50.230 --> 01:17:52.885
<i>If a Black man could integrate
the great American pastime.</i>

1576
01:17:53.712 --> 01:17:55.279
<i>anything seemed possible.</i>

1577
01:17:56.628 --> 01:17:59.631
Every Sunday
in my hometown Fairfield.

1578
01:18:00.458 --> 01:18:02.590
I would read about three guys.

1579
01:18:03.635 --> 01:18:07.204
<i>Joe DiMaggio.
Ted Williams. Stan Musial.</i>

1580
01:18:07.639 --> 01:18:09.032
<i>Those are the guys</i>

1581
01:18:09.206 --> 01:18:11.251
that were on the sport page
every Sunday.

1582
01:18:11.774 --> 01:18:16.126
So when Jackie came in in '47.
he gave me hope.

1583
01:18:17.170 --> 01:18:18.519
Well. man. one of these days

1584
01:18:18.694 --> 01:18:20.913
I might be
on the front page like that.

1585
01:18:22.175 --> 01:18:24.612
<i>Brooklyn became Harlem.</i>

1586
01:18:25.613 --> 01:18:29.530
<i>Or that is to say.
it was a place most loved.</i>

1587
01:18:30.662 --> 01:18:34.361
And whether you would ever go
there or not. you knew Brooklyn

1588
01:18:34.535 --> 01:18:36.929
because Jackie Robinson
was there.

1589
01:18:38.626 --> 01:18:41.020
<i>One of the very first times</i>

1590
01:18:41.238 --> 01:18:44.632
<i>that I went to see the game
at Ebbets Field...</i>

1591
01:18:46.330 --> 01:18:48.767
First of all.
going on the subway.

1592
01:18:48.941 --> 01:18:53.816
you'd have thought all of Harlem
was heading there.

1593
01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:57.994
<i>Everybody I see.
they're bringing along baskets.</i>

1594
01:18:58.255 --> 01:19:01.432
<i>They've got chicken.
It's like a big picnic.</i>

1595
01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:04.740
All of Harlem now
is going to Ebbets Field and so.

1596
01:19:04.914 --> 01:19:07.046
you know where they're going.
and you know why they're going.

1597
01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:09.483
Jackie. Everybody's talking
about Jackie.

1598
01:19:12.312 --> 01:19:13.792
<i>Jackie changed people.</i>

1599
01:19:13.966 --> 01:19:16.621
<i>The whole dynamics
of America changed.</i>

1600
01:19:17.317 --> 01:19:20.103
You know. when the Dodgers
began playing on the road...

1601
01:19:22.192 --> 01:19:24.847
you saw tumultuous scenes.
you know. and...

1602
01:19:26.065 --> 01:19:28.285
this was...
There was a first in everything.

1603
01:19:28.807 --> 01:19:31.114
<i>There was an exhibition game
in Georgia.</i>

1604
01:19:31.636 --> 01:19:33.638
<i>This tremendous crowd
of Black people.</i>

1605
01:19:33.812 --> 01:19:35.553
<i>and the Dodgers emerged
from their dugout.</i>

1606
01:19:37.685 --> 01:19:39.775
<i>A big roar of greeting
from the Black crowd.</i>

1607
01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:43.517
<i>The second thing
is booing from the White stands.</i>

1608
01:19:45.171 --> 01:19:47.304
Okay.
Then the third thing happens.

1609
01:19:47.521 --> 01:19:50.960
What's the third thing?
White people begin standing up

1610
01:19:51.134 --> 01:19:53.005
and clapping
to differentiate themselves.

1611
01:19:54.964 --> 01:19:57.183
<i>How many? Hundreds.</i>

1612
01:19:57.357 --> 01:19:58.924
<i>So. who are these people.
you know?</i>

1613
01:19:59.098 --> 01:20:01.884
<i>They're not all hidden
closet progressives. you know.</i>

1614
01:20:02.754 --> 01:20:05.104
<i>So that's a great dynamic
at work there.</i>

1615
01:20:06.236 --> 01:20:08.151
Black and White
took the field together.

1616
01:20:08.891 --> 01:20:11.023
How do you estimate
the meaning of that. you know?

1617
01:20:12.808 --> 01:20:15.419
<i>Jackie Robinson not only
opened the doors for baseball.</i>

1618
01:20:15.593 --> 01:20:17.856
<i>but he opened the doors
for a lot of other opportunities</i>

1619
01:20:18.030 --> 01:20:19.640
<i>because he brought to mind</i>

1620
01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:22.252
<i>to a lot of predominantly
White businessmen.</i>

1621
01:20:22.426 --> 01:20:24.994
why shouldn't we have
a Black telephone operator?

1622
01:20:25.385 --> 01:20:27.561
Why shouldn't we have
a clerk in our store?

1623
01:20:27.779 --> 01:20:29.041
They didn't understand that.

1624
01:20:29.215 --> 01:20:30.956
until they got to see
Jackie Robinson

1625
01:20:31.130 --> 01:20:35.265
producing like
a professional baseball player

1626
01:20:35.439 --> 01:20:37.441
and then projected that
into other areas of life.

1627
01:20:38.746 --> 01:20:40.661
<i>I think Jack
was one of the catalysts</i>

1628
01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:42.272
<i>for the civil rights movement.</i>

1629
01:20:42.533 --> 01:20:44.448
<i>that somehow
he alerted White people</i>

1630
01:20:44.622 --> 01:20:46.929
to the fact of discrimination

1631
01:20:47.103 --> 01:20:49.453
and what the losses
were for the society.

1632
01:20:49.627 --> 01:20:51.629
that you couldn't include
this talent.

1633
01:20:52.195 --> 01:20:53.631
<i>And I think
he made Black people.</i>

1634
01:20:53.805 --> 01:20:55.285
<i>who had been made
to feel inferior.</i>

1635
01:20:55.459 --> 01:20:57.548
<i>feel prouder of themselves.</i>

1636
01:21:00.203 --> 01:21:02.379
<i>Signing him
was remarkable</i>

1637
01:21:02.553 --> 01:21:05.861
<i>because Jackie was not
a great player when he started.</i>

1638
01:21:06.035 --> 01:21:10.866
but every year he improved
and became very exciting.

1639
01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.520
<i>and a great second baseman.
and a team leader.</i>

1640
01:21:14.043 --> 01:21:16.872
<i>He just... He did
a great job of pioneering.</i>

1641
01:21:18.830 --> 01:21:22.486
But the hostility
to Jackie was very. very strong.

1642
01:21:23.530 --> 01:21:27.621
<i>And now. the Cardinals
were probably the most hostile.</i>

1643
01:21:28.361 --> 01:21:31.712
<i>And I saw Enos Slaughter
run down</i>

1644
01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:35.891
<i>and just deliberately reach out
with his left foot</i>

1645
01:21:36.108 --> 01:21:40.243
<i>and spike
Jackie Robinson's ankle.</i>

1646
01:21:41.853 --> 01:21:43.855
<i>The things
that happened on the ball field</i>

1647
01:21:44.029 --> 01:21:46.466
<i>hurt more than anything else.
simply because of the fact</i>

1648
01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:48.860
<i>that I had been in athletics
for many. many years.</i>

1649
01:21:49.034 --> 01:21:51.950
<i>and I had never really
experienced some of the things</i>

1650
01:21:52.124 --> 01:21:54.126
<i>that were happening to me
at this particular time.</i>

1651
01:21:54.474 --> 01:21:57.260
<i>So Mr. Rickey felt that
for the first few years</i>

1652
01:21:57.434 --> 01:22:00.306
<i>that we couldn't oppose
actually some of the things</i>

1653
01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:01.873
<i>that were said and done to us.</i>

1654
01:22:02.047 --> 01:22:04.136
<i>We had to sort of turn
the other cheek.</i>

1655
01:22:04.832 --> 01:22:06.704
<i>I found that very difficult.
Matter of fact.</i>

1656
01:22:06.878 --> 01:22:08.532
<i>my doctor told me
to get away from baseball</i>

1657
01:22:08.706 --> 01:22:10.534
<i>for fear I was gonna
have a nervous breakdown.</i>

1658
01:22:12.492 --> 01:22:13.929
<i>I knew
what he was going through.</i>

1659
01:22:14.103 --> 01:22:15.974
and I could hear it
in certain cities.

1660
01:22:16.366 --> 01:22:18.629
like Philadelphia and Baltimore.

1661
01:22:18.803 --> 01:22:21.023
some of the places
where there would be

1662
01:22:21.197 --> 01:22:22.807
racial epithets coming
out of the stands

1663
01:22:22.981 --> 01:22:23.939
and that kind of thing.

1664
01:22:24.548 --> 01:22:26.158
<i>And I would...
It would make me angry.</i>

1665
01:22:26.332 --> 01:22:27.899
<i>But I was just as committed
to the course</i>

1666
01:22:28.073 --> 01:22:29.770
<i>that Jack had chosen. as he was.</i>

1667
01:22:30.684 --> 01:22:32.164
<i>and he would fight back
with his bat.</i>

1668
01:22:32.338 --> 01:22:33.861
<i>I mean. he would do well.</i>

1669
01:22:34.036 --> 01:22:37.039
<i>and that would silence
those detractors.</i>

1670
01:22:38.083 --> 01:22:40.738
<i>In that pressure cooker
of that first year.</i>

1671
01:22:40.912 --> 01:22:44.002
<i>he still was Rookie of the Year.
and they won the pennant.</i>

1672
01:22:46.004 --> 01:22:48.441
which has to be
the most incredible.

1673
01:22:48.615 --> 01:22:50.966
courageous feat in the history
of American sports.

1674
01:22:52.532 --> 01:22:54.970
<i>Just look at this.
and think about Jackie Robinson.</i>

1675
01:22:55.361 --> 01:22:58.103
<i>Dark-skinned Black man
puts on a white uniform.</i>

1676
01:22:58.277 --> 01:22:59.844
<i>picks up a bat
made of white ash.</i>

1677
01:23:00.149 --> 01:23:01.802
<i>stands in a white batter's box</i>

1678
01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:03.804
<i>to hit a white baseball
from a White pitcher...</i>

1679
01:23:05.415 --> 01:23:06.851
<i>...thrown over
a white home plate.</i>

1680
01:23:07.025 --> 01:23:09.680
<i>hits the ball
between two white foul lines.</i>

1681
01:23:10.202 --> 01:23:12.552
<i>He's called "out" or "safe"
by a White umpire.</i>

1682
01:23:12.988 --> 01:23:14.511
<i>as White fans boo or cheer.</i>

1683
01:23:15.816 --> 01:23:17.079
He was an ink spot

1684
01:23:17.253 --> 01:23:18.384
on the white canvas
of injustice.

1685
01:23:18.732 --> 01:23:22.040
And so. no matter
how you feel...

1686
01:23:22.475 --> 01:23:25.696
...he was under
a tremendous pressure...

1687
01:23:27.002 --> 01:23:28.220
to try to blend in.

1688
01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:40.624
<i>All those that I talked to
or was around were very excited</i>

1689
01:23:40.798 --> 01:23:43.061
<i>about the Negroes
breaking into the Majors.</i>

1690
01:23:43.235 --> 01:23:46.543
<i>you know.
which I myself was. in a way.</i>

1691
01:23:46.717 --> 01:23:49.024
<i>except that it did wreck
our business.</i>

1692
01:23:49.198 --> 01:23:52.549
<i>And I do feel
it was an unfair approach.</i>

1693
01:23:52.897 --> 01:23:55.943
<i>I feel that it should have been
handled much differently.</i>

1694
01:23:56.596 --> 01:24:00.557
Black executives
of Negro Leagues teams

1695
01:24:00.774 --> 01:24:05.083
were on board with integration
in the sense that they believed

1696
01:24:05.257 --> 01:24:07.912
that integration in baseball

1697
01:24:08.086 --> 01:24:09.914
would mean integration
in all of society.

1698
01:24:10.088 --> 01:24:12.656
that Black people would
ultimately become "equals."

1699
01:24:12.830 --> 01:24:14.092
if you will.

1700
01:24:14.484 --> 01:24:16.007
I'm not even gonna say
that they were opposed

1701
01:24:16.181 --> 01:24:19.663
to integration in baseball

1702
01:24:19.837 --> 01:24:24.146
in terms of its effect
potentially on their teams.

1703
01:24:24.711 --> 01:24:26.844
You know. whether they might
lose some of their best teams.

1704
01:24:27.018 --> 01:24:29.890
You know. once Jackie was signed
away from the Monarchs.

1705
01:24:30.065 --> 01:24:31.762
you know. they understood

1706
01:24:31.936 --> 01:24:33.068
that their players
could be next.

1707
01:24:33.242 --> 01:24:34.547
In fact.
their players were next.

1708
01:24:34.721 --> 01:24:35.722
I don't even think

1709
01:24:35.896 --> 01:24:37.550
they were really
opposed to that.

1710
01:24:37.942 --> 01:24:39.465
The conflict came in

1711
01:24:39.639 --> 01:24:41.902
because they wanted
to be treated fairly

1712
01:24:42.077 --> 01:24:43.469
as businessmen and women.

1713
01:24:44.166 --> 01:24:46.516
<i>Even Cum Posey
was an advocate.</i>

1714
01:24:46.690 --> 01:24:47.952
<i>before he died.</i>

1715
01:24:48.387 --> 01:24:50.346
<i>of integration.</i>

1716
01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:51.738
He would give speeches
and he would say.

1717
01:24:51.912 --> 01:24:53.392
I hope to. you know.

1718
01:24:53.827 --> 01:24:56.047
eventually see Black players
playing in the Major Leagues.

1719
01:24:56.656 --> 01:24:58.963
But it was always
with the expectation that the...

1720
01:24:59.137 --> 01:25:02.314
that the Negro League teams
would be compensated.

1721
01:25:02.923 --> 01:25:04.360
that if they jumped

1722
01:25:04.534 --> 01:25:06.666
from the Negro Leagues
to a pro-team.

1723
01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:08.407
that the pro-team
would essentially

1724
01:25:08.581 --> 01:25:11.932
do what they would do.
you know...

1725
01:25:12.585 --> 01:25:13.847
...amongst themselves.

1726
01:25:14.065 --> 01:25:15.458
which are.
they would buy out the contract.

1727
01:25:15.980 --> 01:25:18.635
<i>Branch Rickey opposed that
from the very beginning.</i>

1728
01:25:18.809 --> 01:25:21.986
<i>In fact. he mocked the idea</i>

1729
01:25:22.204 --> 01:25:25.337
<i>that Jackie Robinson
had any contractual obligation</i>

1730
01:25:25.511 --> 01:25:26.991
<i>to the Kansas City Monarchs.</i>

1731
01:25:27.513 --> 01:25:29.776
<i>or that the Negro Leagues
were even a real league.</i>

1732
01:25:29.950 --> 01:25:31.517
<i>He said they're not even
a real league.</i>

1733
01:25:32.170 --> 01:25:36.435
Branch Rickey didn't even ask...
He accused Dad of being...

1734
01:25:37.828 --> 01:25:40.309
And the Negro Leagues
were ran by a bunch of gamblers.

1735
01:25:40.483 --> 01:25:41.788
I don't know where he got...

1736
01:25:41.962 --> 01:25:43.790
Well. there was one guy
in the East Coast.

1737
01:25:43.964 --> 01:25:46.358
was in the number business.
but that's the only guy

1738
01:25:46.532 --> 01:25:48.099
I ever heard of being
into gambl...

1739
01:25:48.273 --> 01:25:50.319
But he used that
mainly as an excuse.

1740
01:25:50.493 --> 01:25:51.929
so they wouldn't have
to pay him.

1741
01:25:52.234 --> 01:25:54.410
But Branch Rickey
never paid anything.

1742
01:25:54.888 --> 01:25:56.368
really. to anybody.

1743
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:59.676
He was a very close-operating.
cheap person.

1744
01:26:00.894 --> 01:26:03.375
<i>He knew how
the baseball business worked.</i>

1745
01:26:03.593 --> 01:26:05.812
<i>Here are these players
that you have invested in</i>

1746
01:26:05.986 --> 01:26:07.945
<i>that you have trained.
that you have developed.</i>

1747
01:26:08.119 --> 01:26:11.035
<i>Now. I want them to play
on my Major League roster.</i>

1748
01:26:11.209 --> 01:26:13.124
<i>Here is what it should cost me.</i>

1749
01:26:14.081 --> 01:26:17.215
<i>But Jackie Robinson signed
with the Dodgers.</i>

1750
01:26:17.650 --> 01:26:21.263
<i>and Branch Rickey did not pay
the Monarchs for his contract.</i>

1751
01:26:21.524 --> 01:26:24.440
<i>And later. Branch Rickey
signed Roy Campanella</i>

1752
01:26:24.614 --> 01:26:26.224
<i>and did not pay Tom Wilson</i>

1753
01:26:26.398 --> 01:26:28.183
<i>of the Baltimore Elite Giants
for his contract.</i>

1754
01:26:28.357 --> 01:26:29.967
<i>And he signed Don Newcombe.</i>

1755
01:26:30.141 --> 01:26:32.665
<i>and he didn't pay Effa and Abe
for his contract.</i>

1756
01:26:32.970 --> 01:26:34.885
So there was this understanding

1757
01:26:35.059 --> 01:26:36.887
that. not only
was integration happening.

1758
01:26:37.061 --> 01:26:39.542
but it was going
to kill their businesses.

1759
01:26:40.064 --> 01:26:43.328
<i>I never felt he was right
to take those valuable players</i>

1760
01:26:43.502 --> 01:26:44.982
<i>and not give us
a nickel for them.</i>

1761
01:26:45.156 --> 01:26:47.071
<i>I felt that was very wrong.</i>

1762
01:26:47.811 --> 01:26:50.683
<i>and we should have had
some little compensation.</i>

1763
01:26:50.857 --> 01:26:54.209
<i>But we were in no position
to protest. and he knew it.</i>

1764
01:26:54.383 --> 01:26:56.863
<i>So he just completely
outmaneuvered us.</i>

1765
01:26:57.647 --> 01:27:01.085
<i>outsmarted us.
or just plain raped us.</i>

1766
01:27:01.259 --> 01:27:04.349
<i>I don't know what you'd say
or how you'd describe it.</i>

1767
01:27:04.654 --> 01:27:07.396
Bob K: <i>To say that Effa Manley
couldn't stand Branch Rickey</i>

1768
01:27:07.570 --> 01:27:09.049
<i>might be an understatement.</i>

1769
01:27:09.528 --> 01:27:10.964
She didn't care
for Branch Rickey

1770
01:27:11.138 --> 01:27:12.836
because she saw what Branch
was going to do.

1771
01:27:13.445 --> 01:27:16.970
<i>and she was able
to kind of fight him off.</i>

1772
01:27:18.668 --> 01:27:21.714
<i>But she knew she wasn't gonna
be able to continue to hold</i>

1773
01:27:21.932 --> 01:27:25.109
<i>those other owners off
once this thing did break loose.</i>

1774
01:27:25.457 --> 01:27:27.503
As we say.
there was blood in the water.

1775
01:27:27.938 --> 01:27:29.635
and the sharks were coming out.

1776
01:27:32.029 --> 01:27:33.596
<i>At this point.</i>

1777
01:27:33.770 --> 01:27:35.772
<i>Jackie's establishing himself
with the Dodgers</i>

1778
01:27:35.946 --> 01:27:37.469
<i>in the National League.</i>

1779
01:27:37.904 --> 01:27:40.298
<i>Bill Veeck. from Cleveland.
had called and told Effa</i>

1780
01:27:40.472 --> 01:27:42.300
<i>that he wanted
to sign Larry Doby.</i>

1781
01:27:42.648 --> 01:27:44.781
<i>and immediately.</i>

1782
01:27:44.955 --> 01:27:47.740
<i>I think Effa's probably
just happy she got a call</i>

1783
01:27:47.914 --> 01:27:49.176
because she didn't get a call

1784
01:27:49.351 --> 01:27:50.917
from Branch Rickey
for Don Newcombe.

1785
01:27:51.178 --> 01:27:53.529
So already she understands.

1786
01:27:53.703 --> 01:27:57.184
okay. he is at least trying
to do business with me.

1787
01:27:58.055 --> 01:28:00.318
And he makes it clear that
he wants to sign Larry Doby.

1788
01:28:00.492 --> 01:28:02.712
And she says. "Okay. well.
how much will you give me?"

1789
01:28:02.886 --> 01:28:04.975
<i>So Bill Veeck.</i>

1790
01:28:05.149 --> 01:28:06.759
<i>the owner
of the Cleveland Indians.</i>

1791
01:28:06.933 --> 01:28:09.588
<i>offered 10.000 dollars
for Larry Doby's contract.</i>

1792
01:28:09.806 --> 01:28:11.329
It wasn't a lot of money.

1793
01:28:11.721 --> 01:28:12.939
but it was a whole lot more
than anybody else was paying.

1794
01:28:13.592 --> 01:28:17.074
And Effa said.
"You know. Mr. Veeck.

1795
01:28:17.248 --> 01:28:19.032
<i>if he were White
and a free agent.</i>

1796
01:28:19.206 --> 01:28:21.121
<i>you could get
100.000 dollars for him."</i>

1797
01:28:21.296 --> 01:28:23.254
And Veeck says.
"Well. yeah. you're right.

1798
01:28:23.428 --> 01:28:24.734
I'll tell you what.

1799
01:28:24.908 --> 01:28:25.996
If he sticks with the team
for a month.

1800
01:28:26.170 --> 01:28:27.737
I'll pay you another five."

1801
01:28:27.911 --> 01:28:29.521
I think that made her
tremendously important.

1802
01:28:29.695 --> 01:28:33.003
A woman in a man's space.
speaking up and running a team.

1803
01:28:33.177 --> 01:28:35.614
but also a woman
in a man's space saying.

1804
01:28:35.788 --> 01:28:36.920
"Run me my money."

1805
01:28:38.138 --> 01:28:41.098
<i>So Bill Veeck
brings in Larry Doby.</i>

1806
01:28:41.664 --> 01:28:44.275
<i>He also will bring in
Satchel Paige.</i>

1807
01:28:44.928 --> 01:28:47.757
<i>Paige is pretty old
by that time.</i>

1808
01:28:48.279 --> 01:28:49.759
but he comes in.

1809
01:28:50.281 --> 01:28:54.111
he sets attendance records
in his first three games.

1810
01:28:54.285 --> 01:28:55.852
and he can still pitch.

1811
01:28:56.026 --> 01:28:57.854
Announcer 1: <i>Lou Boudreau
goes to the mound.</i>

1812
01:28:58.028 --> 01:28:59.508
<i>that's all for Christopher
and it's gonna be Satchel Paige.</i>

1813
01:28:59.682 --> 01:29:01.336
<i>And here's the announcement</i>

1814
01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:03.381
<i>about the appearance
of Satchel Paige. Listen.</i>

1815
01:29:03.555 --> 01:29:05.296
Announcer 2: <i>Satchel Paige!</i>

1816
01:29:08.386 --> 01:29:09.648
<i>And he will pitch in relief.</i>

1817
01:29:09.822 --> 01:29:11.433
<i>he will pitch
in the World Series.</i>

1818
01:29:11.607 --> 01:29:13.043
<i>and the Indians will win.</i>

1819
01:29:21.878 --> 01:29:24.881
<i>That was the death knell
of Negro League Baseball.</i>

1820
01:29:26.752 --> 01:29:28.232
<i>When they signed
the Black players.</i>

1821
01:29:28.406 --> 01:29:30.147
<i>the people that had been coming</i>

1822
01:29:30.321 --> 01:29:33.803
<i>to Griffith Stadium
in Washington to see us play.</i>

1823
01:29:33.977 --> 01:29:36.458
<i>and in Yankee Stadium
to see us play.</i>

1824
01:29:37.154 --> 01:29:40.113
now. they want
to see Jackie play.

1825
01:29:41.245 --> 01:29:42.899
<i>The interest
in the Negro League</i>

1826
01:29:43.073 --> 01:29:44.596
<i>really fell off.</i>

1827
01:29:44.901 --> 01:29:46.642
<i>So they found out
that they couldn't continue</i>

1828
01:29:46.816 --> 01:29:48.121
<i>to pay the salaries.</i>

1829
01:29:48.295 --> 01:29:50.254
<i>And. you know.
all those favorite fans</i>

1830
01:29:50.428 --> 01:29:54.389
<i>now were going to see players
that had just been called up.</i>

1831
01:29:56.303 --> 01:29:57.740
<i>Integration took place.</i>

1832
01:29:57.914 --> 01:30:01.613
<i>and I begged Abe to quit
the next year</i>

1833
01:30:01.787 --> 01:30:04.442
<i>because we dropped
another 20.000 dollars.</i>

1834
01:30:04.616 --> 01:30:06.096
<i>I mean. the fans deserted us</i>

1835
01:30:06.270 --> 01:30:08.446
<i>to go see the boys
on the White team.</i>

1836
01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:12.450
<i>Deserted us like they say
rats desert a ship.[chuckling]</i>

1837
01:30:15.061 --> 01:30:16.367
Bob M: <i>With the onset
of integration</i>

1838
01:30:16.541 --> 01:30:18.151
<i>in the great American pastime.</i>

1839
01:30:19.065 --> 01:30:21.067
<i>the once-prosperous
Negro National League</i>

1840
01:30:21.241 --> 01:30:24.070
<i>in the East folded in 1948.</i>

1841
01:30:24.854 --> 01:30:27.334
<i>Only the Negro American League
in the Midwest was left</i>

1842
01:30:27.509 --> 01:30:30.250
<i>to hold down the fort
of Black baseball.</i>

1843
01:30:32.339 --> 01:30:34.429
<i>So on the East Coast primarily</i>

1844
01:30:34.603 --> 01:30:38.302
<i>is where you saw
that really quick downfall.</i>

1845
01:30:38.476 --> 01:30:40.391
<i>Effa called it
"Jackie Robinson Country"</i>

1846
01:30:40.565 --> 01:30:42.828
because where she was playing
in Newark. like. you know.

1847
01:30:43.002 --> 01:30:46.049
her fans could just catch
a train and go see Jackie.

1848
01:30:46.266 --> 01:30:48.834
<i>When people have one option.
or you know.</i>

1849
01:30:49.008 --> 01:30:50.445
<i>they don't have money
to go to multiple games.</i>

1850
01:30:50.619 --> 01:30:52.272
<i>they're choosing
to go see Jackie.</i>

1851
01:30:52.447 --> 01:30:54.579
<i>Why am I going to go see
the segregated ballclub</i>

1852
01:30:54.753 --> 01:30:56.407
<i>that was born of Jim Crow</i>

1853
01:30:56.581 --> 01:30:58.453
<i>and represent segregation
and all of these things.</i>

1854
01:30:58.627 --> 01:31:00.890
<i>when I can go see Jackie?
He's the hope. He's the future.</i>

1855
01:31:04.154 --> 01:31:05.982
One of the questions
I get asked all the time

1856
01:31:06.156 --> 01:31:09.202
about integration is.
"Layton. wasn't it wonderful

1857
01:31:09.376 --> 01:31:12.118
that when Jackie Robinson
got called up.

1858
01:31:12.292 --> 01:31:15.731
that it opened up baseball
for all the Black ballplayers?"

1859
01:31:16.122 --> 01:31:18.342
And I said. "If you talk
to the ballplayers themselves.

1860
01:31:18.516 --> 01:31:19.691
the answer is no."

1861
01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:22.825
Is... If you were
an impact ballplayer

1862
01:31:22.999 --> 01:31:25.828
<i>like Larry Doby.
or Roy Campanella.</i>

1863
01:31:26.002 --> 01:31:28.744
<i>or Don Newcombe.
or a Jackie Robinson.</i>

1864
01:31:28.918 --> 01:31:30.310
<i>there was gonna be a chance</i>

1865
01:31:30.485 --> 01:31:32.051
that you could play
in organized baseball.

1866
01:31:32.225 --> 01:31:34.750
But for the average
Negro League ballplayer. no.

1867
01:31:35.446 --> 01:31:39.102
<i>I knew that everybody
couldn't be the same</i>

1868
01:31:39.276 --> 01:31:41.583
<i>and be that at the same time.</i>

1869
01:31:42.105 --> 01:31:44.411
It's a lack of opportunities.
that's all.

1870
01:31:45.848 --> 01:31:47.327
<i>But we had ballplayers</i>

1871
01:31:47.502 --> 01:31:48.764
<i>that could have played
in the Major Leagues</i>

1872
01:31:48.938 --> 01:31:50.809
<i>when they first started playing.</i>

1873
01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:52.855
<i>But they didn't get the chance.</i>

1874
01:31:54.247 --> 01:31:55.684
<i>Willie Wells.</i>

1875
01:31:56.206 --> 01:31:58.208
<i>there ain't no baseball player
in Major League Baseball.</i>

1876
01:31:58.382 --> 01:32:00.645
no better ballplayer
shortstop than Willie Wells.

1877
01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:04.475
Raymond Dandridge...
...Josh Gibson.

1878
01:32:06.129 --> 01:32:08.566
<i>Josh Gibson
was always in the conversation</i>

1879
01:32:08.740 --> 01:32:10.742
<i>about this vision some day</i>

1880
01:32:10.916 --> 01:32:12.439
<i>of Black players playing
in the Major Leagues</i>

1881
01:32:12.962 --> 01:32:14.746
<i>because. by the mid-1930s.</i>

1882
01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:16.356
<i>he was considered
the greatest hitter</i>

1883
01:32:16.531 --> 01:32:17.749
<i>in Black baseball.</i>

1884
01:32:18.054 --> 01:32:19.142
and people who had seen him play
would say. like.

1885
01:32:19.316 --> 01:32:21.144
"He's greater than Babe Ruth."

1886
01:32:21.536 --> 01:32:23.407
<i>But in fact.
Wendell Smith himself.</i>

1887
01:32:23.581 --> 01:32:25.540
<i>and some of the other
top Black sportswriters.</i>

1888
01:32:25.714 --> 01:32:31.023
<i>had actually stopped advocating
for Josh Gibson by the 1940s</i>

1889
01:32:31.197 --> 01:32:33.330
<i>because they thought
he had too many demons.</i>

1890
01:32:33.678 --> 01:32:34.897
<i>According to the family.</i>

1891
01:32:35.375 --> 01:32:37.987
<i>Josh was diagnosed
with a brain tumor.</i>

1892
01:32:38.770 --> 01:32:41.556
<i>And it took a toll on him.
physically and mentally.</i>

1893
01:32:42.382 --> 01:32:45.734
<i>He lost his sense
of who he was and control</i>

1894
01:32:45.908 --> 01:32:48.998
<i>and was found wandering
around the streets of San Juan.</i>

1895
01:32:50.260 --> 01:32:52.741
<i>And he passed
not long after that.</i>

1896
01:32:53.698 --> 01:32:57.963
<i>And it was a very.
very sad ending for someone who.</i>

1897
01:32:58.137 --> 01:32:59.617
<i>anybody who saw him play.</i>

1898
01:32:59.791 --> 01:33:01.184
<i>said this was one
of the greatest players</i>

1899
01:33:01.358 --> 01:33:02.446
<i>who ever played the game.</i>

1900
01:33:08.974 --> 01:33:10.672
There were still
attempts to keep going.

1901
01:33:10.846 --> 01:33:12.499
to keep playing.
And even into the '50s.

1902
01:33:12.674 --> 01:33:14.676
there were some players
that were being recruited.

1903
01:33:15.111 --> 01:33:17.113
<i>Henry Aaron was playing
on a Black team</i>

1904
01:33:17.287 --> 01:33:18.767
<i>when he was recruited.</i>

1905
01:33:19.115 --> 01:33:22.379
<i>and we saw all kinds of efforts
to bring in more ticket sales.</i>

1906
01:33:22.553 --> 01:33:24.642
<i>like the signing of women
to play games.</i>

1907
01:33:26.775 --> 01:33:29.081
<i>There's good baseball
being played by Negro Leaguers.</i>

1908
01:33:29.255 --> 01:33:33.695
<i>and the league itself
persists down to 1960.</i>

1909
01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:38.569
But it's not anywhere near
the quality of baseball played

1910
01:33:38.743 --> 01:33:40.702
when the Negro Leagues
were at their height.

1911
01:33:45.010 --> 01:33:46.621
<i>I don't know
if it was apparent at first.</i>

1912
01:33:46.795 --> 01:33:49.536
<i>but I think over time the loss
of the Negro Leagues</i>

1913
01:33:49.711 --> 01:33:52.322
<i>began to be more felt.</i>

1914
01:33:52.670 --> 01:33:54.324
and that people began
to understand

1915
01:33:54.498 --> 01:33:55.673
that the loss
of the Negro Leagues

1916
01:33:55.847 --> 01:33:57.719
was something significant.

1917
01:33:59.024 --> 01:34:02.724
<i>It was felt in many ways
that were tangible.</i>

1918
01:34:02.985 --> 01:34:05.422
<i>You know. when we start talking
about all of the people</i>

1919
01:34:05.596 --> 01:34:07.337
<i>that it takes
to make a team run.</i>

1920
01:34:07.511 --> 01:34:10.122
<i>whether we're talking
about bus drivers. or. you know.</i>

1921
01:34:10.296 --> 01:34:12.516
<i>people working concessions
or taking tickets.</i>

1922
01:34:12.690 --> 01:34:14.474
all of those people
typically came

1923
01:34:14.649 --> 01:34:16.172
from within
that Black community.

1924
01:34:17.695 --> 01:34:19.958
<i>But then.
there's also the intangible.</i>

1925
01:34:20.132 --> 01:34:22.004
<i>of in the midst
of all of the stuff</i>

1926
01:34:22.178 --> 01:34:24.746
<i>that we have to deal with
as Black people in this society.</i>

1927
01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:26.312
<i>this place where we can go.</i>

1928
01:34:26.486 --> 01:34:28.140
<i>where we can get dressed
to the nines.</i>

1929
01:34:28.314 --> 01:34:29.881
<i>where we can hang out.</i>

1930
01:34:30.055 --> 01:34:31.666
<i>where we can root
for our favorite players</i>

1931
01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:35.017
and are free to just be us
without the White gaze.

1932
01:34:35.191 --> 01:34:36.366
They lost that too.

1933
01:34:37.976 --> 01:34:40.979
<i>What happened
was starting in the '50s.</i>

1934
01:34:41.153 --> 01:34:43.199
<i>a lot of the Black folks.</i>

1935
01:34:43.373 --> 01:34:45.941
<i>who had the opportunity
to leave those communities</i>

1936
01:34:46.115 --> 01:34:49.771
to go to college. to rise
within White professions.

1937
01:34:49.945 --> 01:34:53.122
did so. and they left

1938
01:34:53.688 --> 01:34:55.907
<i>folks who were stuck
in those communities</i>

1939
01:34:56.081 --> 01:34:57.561
<i>to be on their own</i>

1940
01:34:57.996 --> 01:34:59.737
<i>at a time when they were
more vulnerable than ever.</i>

1941
01:35:00.346 --> 01:35:02.914
<i>as a result
of the declining industries.</i>

1942
01:35:03.088 --> 01:35:06.526
<i>as a result of the devastating
impact of urban renewal.</i>

1943
01:35:07.136 --> 01:35:10.139
<i>These housing projects
and highway projects.</i>

1944
01:35:10.617 --> 01:35:13.664
<i>So the demise
of the Negro Leagues</i>

1945
01:35:13.969 --> 01:35:17.537
<i>foreshadows a larger crisis</i>

1946
01:35:17.712 --> 01:35:19.931
<i>for Black America
in those communities.</i>

1947
01:35:21.324 --> 01:35:23.195
<i>You look at just
the Crawford Grill</i>

1948
01:35:23.369 --> 01:35:27.069
<i>and across the street
is a Black barbershop.</i>

1949
01:35:27.417 --> 01:35:28.940
<i>And it's fascinating</i>

1950
01:35:29.114 --> 01:35:31.769
<i>after the integration
of Major Leagues.</i>

1951
01:35:32.074 --> 01:35:34.859
<i>you see the deterioration.</i>

1952
01:35:36.643 --> 01:35:40.560
It's just devastating
to the Black community.

1953
01:35:42.475 --> 01:35:44.216
Bob K: <i>When we talk
about integration.</i>

1954
01:35:44.434 --> 01:35:49.134
<i>it was good morally.
it was good socially.</i>

1955
01:35:49.787 --> 01:35:51.441
<i>and it moved us in ways</i>

1956
01:35:51.615 --> 01:35:54.357
<i>in which we probably never.
ever dreamed possible.</i>

1957
01:35:55.967 --> 01:35:58.535
But that progress
came at a cost.

1958
01:36:02.757 --> 01:36:06.673
<i>The enduring importance
of the Negro Leagues is the fact</i>

1959
01:36:06.848 --> 01:36:09.285
<i>that we can do this thing
on our own.</i>

1960
01:36:09.459 --> 01:36:10.982
I'm not saying we should.

1961
01:36:11.156 --> 01:36:13.071
I'm not saying that
we should go off in a corner

1962
01:36:13.245 --> 01:36:15.160
and. you know.
build our own teams and leagues

1963
01:36:15.334 --> 01:36:17.946
and recreate
Negro Leagues baseball.

1964
01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:19.164
But we can.

1965
01:36:20.035 --> 01:36:23.865
<i>We know. and White baseball
should know as well.</i>

1966
01:36:24.039 --> 01:36:26.868
<i>that we're capable
'cause we already did the thing.</i>

1967
01:36:28.783 --> 01:36:31.133
<i>Boom.
Out toward straight center.</i>

1968
01:36:31.437 --> 01:36:34.963
<i>Willie Mays catches it.
450 feet.</i>

1969
01:36:35.137 --> 01:36:37.704
<i>Say. hey. Willie.
was that a catch!</i>

1970
01:36:37.879 --> 01:36:40.272
<i>Would baseball
be baseball today</i>

1971
01:36:40.446 --> 01:36:42.797
<i>without Willie Mays
from the Birmingham Black Barons</i>

1972
01:36:43.275 --> 01:36:46.017
<i>or Ernie Banks
from the Kansas City Monarchs?</i>

1973
01:36:48.846 --> 01:36:52.241
The Negro Leagues brought
a new dynamic to the game.

1974
01:36:52.415 --> 01:36:54.765
It made the game
a better version of itself.

1975
01:36:55.026 --> 01:36:56.811
<i>By the '60s and '70s.</i>

1976
01:36:57.028 --> 01:36:59.161
<i>guys who had not played
in the Negro Leagues</i>

1977
01:36:59.639 --> 01:37:03.339
<i>come on the scene in what really
was the heyday of Black baseball</i>

1978
01:37:03.513 --> 01:37:04.993
<i>in the Majors.</i>

1979
01:37:05.167 --> 01:37:06.690
<i>Hank Robinson
jockeys the count</i>

1980
01:37:06.864 --> 01:37:07.952
<i>to three and two.
before he gets his pitch</i>

1981
01:37:08.474 --> 01:37:10.476
<i>Players like Frank Robinson</i>

1982
01:37:10.650 --> 01:37:12.652
<i>excelled at every level
of the game.</i>

1983
01:37:12.827 --> 01:37:15.220
<i>Like Rube Foster.
he was a star player.</i>

1984
01:37:15.394 --> 01:37:18.049
<i>a manager.
and a baseball executive.</i>

1985
01:37:18.528 --> 01:37:21.183
<i>Bob Gibson was the greatest
Black pitcher</i>

1986
01:37:21.748 --> 01:37:23.185
<i>since Satchel Paige.</i>

1987
01:37:23.576 --> 01:37:25.970
<i>And Reggie Jackson.
like Josh Gibson.</i>

1988
01:37:26.144 --> 01:37:29.191
<i>who is one of the most feared
sluggers in baseball history.</i>

1989
01:37:31.193 --> 01:37:34.239
Black and Latin players made it
a very different game.

1990
01:37:34.413 --> 01:37:36.372
<i>and with their success
on the field.</i>

1991
01:37:36.546 --> 01:37:38.156
<i>there was no turning back.</i>

1992
01:37:38.330 --> 01:37:40.985
<i>Upton steals home!</i>

1993
01:37:41.159 --> 01:37:43.466
Bob M: <i>On April 8th. 1974.</i>

1994
01:37:43.945 --> 01:37:45.555
<i>Hank Aaron broke
Babe Ruth's record.</i>

1995
01:37:45.729 --> 01:37:47.513
<i>one of the most sacred
in baseball.</i>

1996
01:37:47.687 --> 01:37:51.213
<i>hitting his 715th home run
in the Major Leagues.</i>

1997
01:37:51.387 --> 01:37:53.911
<i>Swinging and there's
a drive into left-center field.</i>

1998
01:37:54.085 --> 01:37:56.000
<i>that ball is out of here!</i>

1999
01:37:56.174 --> 01:37:57.784
<i>It's 715.</i>

2000
01:37:58.002 --> 01:38:00.831
<i>there is a new home run champion
of all time.</i>

2001
01:38:01.179 --> 01:38:02.528
<i>and it's Henry Aaron!</i>

2002
01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:04.574
<i>Hank Aaron once said.</i>

2003
01:38:04.879 --> 01:38:07.055
<i>"My abilities are only limited
by the lack of opportunity."</i>

2004
01:38:07.316 --> 01:38:08.883
<i>And once he got
that opportunity.</i>

2005
01:38:09.274 --> 01:38:11.320
<i>he made an assault
on Ruth's record.</i>

2006
01:38:11.711 --> 01:38:15.150
<i>Henry Aaron.
the home run king of all time...</i>

2007
01:38:15.324 --> 01:38:16.760
<i>So let's keep in mind</i>

2008
01:38:17.108 --> 01:38:19.284
that Babe Ruth never hit
a home run off a Black pitcher.

2009
01:38:19.458 --> 01:38:21.678
<i>His record was set
in apartheid baseball.</i>

2010
01:38:21.852 --> 01:38:24.594
<i>which makes Hank Aaron's record
more valuable.</i>

2011
01:38:24.811 --> 01:38:26.291
<i>His record was set</i>

2012
01:38:26.465 --> 01:38:28.598
<i>against the best pitchers
on the planet.</i>

2013
01:38:29.686 --> 01:38:31.688
Bob M: <i>Following years
of pressure from the public.</i>

2014
01:38:32.210 --> 01:38:33.733
<i>Satchel Paige
became the first player</i>

2015
01:38:33.908 --> 01:38:36.084
<i>to be inducted
into the Baseball Hall of Fame</i>

2016
01:38:36.258 --> 01:38:38.782
<i>based on his record
in the Negro Leagues.</i>

2017
01:38:39.217 --> 01:38:41.567
I am the proudest man
on Earth right today.

2018
01:38:41.741 --> 01:38:44.396
and I know my wife is.

2019
01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:48.139
Bob M: <i>The following year.</i>

2020
01:38:48.531 --> 01:38:50.446
<i>he was joined by Buck Leonard
and Josh Gibson.</i>

2021
01:38:50.620 --> 01:38:52.491
<i>and then "Cool Papa" Bell.</i>

2022
01:38:52.752 --> 01:38:55.364
<i>Many more would follow.
including Rube Foster.</i>

2023
01:38:55.625 --> 01:38:58.193
<i>Effa Manley.
and Cumberland Posey.</i>

2024
01:38:59.020 --> 01:39:01.065
<i>It's hard to do
too much for pioneers.</i>

2025
01:39:01.239 --> 01:39:03.372
I think. you know.
we stand on their shoulders.

2026
01:39:03.546 --> 01:39:06.636
and we know it.
They paved the way for us.

2027
01:39:06.941 --> 01:39:09.595
<i>and we should have
a lasting gratitude toward them.</i>

2028
01:39:10.901 --> 01:39:13.469
Bob K: <i>The Negro League
players themselves.</i>

2029
01:39:13.773 --> 01:39:15.993
<i>they had no idea
they were making history.</i>

2030
01:39:16.428 --> 01:39:18.735
Man. they didn't care
about making no history.

2031
01:39:18.909 --> 01:39:23.522
They just wanted to play ball.
But the pride. the passion.

2032
01:39:24.349 --> 01:39:26.699
<i>the courage that
they demonstrated</i>

2033
01:39:26.873 --> 01:39:28.701
<i>in the face of adversity.</i>

2034
01:39:29.267 --> 01:39:35.143
<i>To overcome the adversity
transcends race. transcends age.</i>

2035
01:39:35.317 --> 01:39:38.189
<i>transcends gender.
And that's the real story.</i>

2036
01:40:31.677 --> 01:40:32.983
It was in my blood.

2037
01:40:33.244 --> 01:40:35.159
It'’s still in my blood
to be an umpire.

2038
01:40:35.855 --> 01:40:38.684
You call a player safe.
it just get all over ya.

2039
01:40:38.858 --> 01:40:41.426
You call a player out.
it just get all over ya.

2040
01:40:41.731 --> 01:40:43.733
It's just like a... in heaven.
