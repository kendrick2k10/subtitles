- [Jonathan] Just hang on.

23
00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.093
What is this?

24
00:04:41.252 --> 00:04:42.850
Hanging's not till tomorrow.

25
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:43.923
- Bob says now.

26
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.490
- [Jonathan] Marshal's not even here.

27
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.890
Lemmy. it's Sunday for God's sake.

28
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.890
- Believe he's planning to get
it done before church starts.

29
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.998
- I'll be out in a minute.

30
00:04:55.998 --> 00:04:56.948
Just wait out here.

31
00:04:58.015 --> 00:04:59.165
Mabel's still sleeping.

32
00:05:01.241 --> 00:05:03.658
(door slams)

33
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.123
Bastard. Always gotta show off.

34
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.470
I thought you'd be next to me when I woke.

35
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:21.590
- Couldn't sleep.

36
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.563
Not well. at least.

37
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.960
- Bob's fixing to hang that
horse thief this morning.

38
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:36.763
- It's Sunday.

39
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:38.730
- My thoughts exactly.

40
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:45.543
You best stay here.

41
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.810
- I must get ready for church.

42
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:52.890
- One week without won't hurt.

43
00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.223
Do as I say Mabel.

44
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.970
I don't want you to see this.

45
00:06:02.452 --> 00:06:05.619
(church bell ringing)

46
00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:14.730
I'll be home for supper.

(prisoner grumbling)

49
00:06:41.793 --> 00:06:42.680
- Thought you needed a bath

50
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.703
before you went to meet
your maker. (chuckles)

51
00:06:47.616 --> 00:06:49.298
(man imitating choking)

52
00:06:49.298 --> 00:06:52.216
(man chuckling)

53
00:06:52.216 --> 00:06:55.393
- (sniffs) You smell that?

54
00:06:56.497 --> 00:06:58.710
When that sun first came up this morning.

55
00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.937
I got my first breath
of fresh air. I thought.

56
00:07:00.937 --> 00:07:04.163
"Goddamn! It smells like
a good day for a hanging."

57
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.160
- You think I don't know the reason?

58
00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.620
Why you don't wanna wait a day to kill me?

59
00:07:13.619 --> 00:07:15.707
- Get in there and put some irons on him.

60
00:07:20.516 --> 00:07:23.743
(door creaking)

61
00:07:23.743 --> 00:07:26.326
(bell tolling)

62
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:30.763
The noose is set.

63
00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:35.413
If you wanna try something.
a struggle of some sort.

64
00:07:36.327 --> 00:07:37.933
well. we won't have to use it.

65
00:07:39.592 --> 00:07:40.892
- I'll be waiting for you.

66
00:07:42.357 --> 00:07:43.774
Me and the devil.

67
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.180
(Mabel sighs)

68
00:07:57.194 --> 00:08:00.777
(patriotic drumming music)

69
00:08:18.671 --> 00:08:22.088
(horse neighing)
- Go on!

70
00:08:24.031 --> 00:08:27.698
(patriotic music continues)

71
00:08:41.543 --> 00:08:43.086
- Gather round. folks!

72
00:08:43.086 --> 00:08:45.879
Time to watch a hanging!

73
00:08:45.879 --> 00:08:47.530
(Bob chuckles)

74
00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:52.530
(patriotic music continues)
(bell tolling)

75
00:09:28.505 --> 00:09:31.255
(paper rustling)

76
00:09:34.345 --> 00:09:37.428
(telegraph clicking)

77
00:09:41.346 --> 00:09:44.763
(tense orchestral music)

78
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.843
Now. now. Merriweather.

79
00:09:57.046 --> 00:09:59.670
If anyone's going to shoot
this bastard. it'll be me.

80
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:00.503
- Bob!

81
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:03.860
I need you to help get that boy down.

82
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:05.573
- Bob?

83
00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.010
You met The Almighty in person.

84
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.970
you wouldn't call him by
his first name. would you?

85
00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:12.033
- Sheriff.

86
00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.743
I cannot conduct services
with him up there.

87
00:10:17.371 --> 00:10:19.530
- Don't you worry none. I'll get him down.

88
00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:22.030
right after this one falls
through that trap door.

89
00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:25.083
- Bob.

90
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:27.203
Sheriff.

91
00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:31.483
This is the Lord's day.

92
00:10:33.882 --> 00:10:35.382
- Well. he can have it back in

93
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:38.380
less than half an hour.

94
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:42.793
- Thought we were waiting for the marshal.

95
00:10:44.367 --> 00:10:47.034
(birds singing)

96
00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:50.890
- We'll let him hang up there long enough

97
00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:52.640
for the marshal to get a good look.

98
00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.580
- Who in the hell is that?

99
00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:01.570
- His boy. I imagine.

100
00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:02.770
- He don't belong to me.

101
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.520
- Well. another thief. I'm sure.

102
00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.210
- What's he doing all the way up there?

103
00:11:12.419 --> 00:11:13.800
- I don't suppose you climbed up there

104
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.440
to save your friend's life?

105
00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.483
- He can't talk.

106
00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:19.890
Someone cut out his tongue.

107
00:11:21.298 --> 00:11:23.937
- (chuckling) Cut out his tongue.

108
00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.130
Well. I hope you got some other reason.

109
00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:30.883
Hate to see you waste your time.

110
00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:42.654
Deputy. care to come along?

111
00:11:42.654 --> 00:11:44.210
(tense orchestral music)

112
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:45.247
- Get a move on.

113
00:11:46.188 --> 00:11:48.005
(tense orchestral music continues)

114
00:11:48.005 --> 00:11:51.255
(footsteps clattering)

115
00:12:08.946 --> 00:12:13.196
(tense orchestral music continues)

116
00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.960
- I bet you never had so many people

117
00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.760
waiting to hear what you had to say.

118
00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.350
Almost like someone cut
your tongue out. too.

119
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:34.550
- [Paul] Get on with it.

120
00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:39.373
- Good morning. folks.

121
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:44.440
I know this might seem like
an unusual time for this

122
00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.110
but there's never a bad
time to see justice done.

123
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.623
And that is what you're about to see.

124
00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.193
This man is a horse thief.

125
00:12:56.733 --> 00:12:57.733
A jackal.

126
00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.593
Been scavenging on the
outskirts of our town.

127
00:13:03.507 --> 00:13:07.563
And like all bad men. his
bad got the best of him.

128
00:13:09.324 --> 00:13:12.290
Let this be a demonstration.

129
00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:15.903
A symbol of what happens
when evil comes around here.

130
00:13:17.045 --> 00:13:19.885
(Lemmy claps)

131
00:13:19.885 --> 00:13:22.635
(crowd clapping)

132
00:13:27.337 --> 00:13:29.210
- I got something to say.

133
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:30.700
- You had your chance.

134
00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.593
- He has the right to a few words.

135
00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:41.600
- What's the expression?

136
00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.433
Wax eloquent.

137
00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.730
- What this man says here is right.

138
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.790
I tried to own something
that didn't belong to me.

139
00:13:57.312 --> 00:14:01.610
But the truth is. it didn't
belong to no one else. either.

140
00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:05.483
You can take what was once free.

141
00:14:07.192 --> 00:14:08.592
and you could call it yours.

142
00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:13.163
but it ain't unless it wants to be.

143
00:14:16.163 --> 00:14:18.813
I just ask that no one hurts
themselves on my behalf.

144
00:14:20.225 --> 00:14:22.603
- (chuckling) If that
ain't wishful thinking.

145
00:14:23.792 --> 00:14:25.147
- Sheriff!

146
00:14:25.147 --> 00:14:27.080
Sheriff!
(tense orchestral music)

147
00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:27.913
Sheriff!

148
00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:32.532
Telegram!

149
00:14:32.532 --> 00:14:35.230
(tense orchestral music continues)

150
00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:36.230
From Marshal Graham.

151
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:38.550
- Take off the noose.

152
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:39.700
- It stays where it is!

153
00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:42.590
We might hang him in a minute.

154
00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:43.810
Read it.

155
00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:46.270
- Leaving Mammoth this morning. stop.

156
00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:48.170
Arriving by noon. stop.

157
00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:50.280
Questions for prisoner. stop.

158
00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.319
Must be alive. stop.

159
00:14:52.319 --> 00:14:56.569
(tense orchestral music continues)

160
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:06.633
- While you're at it.
take him back to the jail.

161
00:15:08.445 --> 00:15:09.940
(Mabel sighs)

162
00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:10.773
He'll hang!

163
00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.623
By my word. he'll hang by nightfall!

164
00:15:16.119 --> 00:15:17.269
I'll take my breakfast.

165
00:15:18.141 --> 00:15:22.058
(melancholic orchestral music)

166
00:15:32.242 --> 00:15:33.075
- Get on.

167
00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:38.490
- What are you doing here?

168
00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.280
- The whole town was.

169
00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.220
- I told you it'd be best
to stay in the house.

170
00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.670
- That house doesn't own me. Jonathan.

171
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:48.423
- I just want what's best for you.

172
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:50.873
To keep you safe.

173
00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:54.490
- Or it's that you don't want your wife

174
00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:56.243
to see the things you take part in.

175
00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:01.523
- My part is the law. and I
do my best to abide by it.

176
00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:03.973
As we all should.

177
00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:10.163
- As you wish.

178
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:14.490
- You talk to me less and less these days.

179
00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:16.560
- My father warned you I was a quiet girl.

180
00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.240
- He told me it would pass with time.

181
00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.830
- Well. I'm sorry what he
sold you was not what you

182
00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:21.070
bargained for.
- Mabel. what has

183
00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:22.127
become of you?

184
00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.993
- A woman can change just like a man.

185
00:16:29.036 --> 00:16:32.460
(bell tolling)
(melancholic music continues)

186
00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:33.900
- Even when the seasons change.

187
00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.763
they don't do so without reason.

188
00:16:37.192 --> 00:16:40.670
(bell tolling)
(melancholic music continues)

189
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:41.553
- It will pass.

190
00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:46.343
Soon. there will be no reason for concern.

191
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.273
I promise you.

192
00:16:51.027 --> 00:16:52.520
(bell tolling)

193
00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:53.660
Go on back to the house.

194
00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:54.760
I'll be there shortly.

195
00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:56.940
- I won't be coming home.

196
00:17:00.297 --> 00:17:01.863
There's a boy up on the church.

197
00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:05.290
Got to get him down somehow.

198
00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:06.123
- A boy?

199
00:17:07.484 --> 00:17:09.210
- One of the horse thief's friends.

200
00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:10.043
Must've climbed up

201
00:17:10.043 --> 00:17:11.230
this morning.
- Marcus.

202
00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:14.870
I hope you can get him down.

203
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:20.343
Please.

204
00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:22.613
Take care of yourself.

205
00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:28.650
(footsteps clattering)

206
00:17:38.346 --> 00:17:40.763
(Mabel sobs)

207
00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:39.803
- Another second and I'd have pulled it.

208
00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.510
and you'd have dropped
like a sack of potatoes.

209
00:18:47.489 --> 00:18:50.890
- Damn it. Lemmy. look
what you made me done.

210
00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:53.660
- There ain't nothing wrong
with a little dust in it.

211
00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:56.815
- Quit it. Quit it!

212
00:18:56.815 --> 00:18:58.640
Get over here and help me pick it up.

213
00:18:58.640 --> 00:18:59.473
- No. thank you.

214
00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:02.620
- Get your skinny. little
butt on down the street

215
00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:03.833
and buy me another plug.

216
00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:06.040
Quit it. dog.

217
00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.620
- Sure.

218
00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:10.020
You got a couple dollars you can give me?

219
00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.780
Pay me for my time?

220
00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:14.060
- Don't tell me your
pockets got holes in them.

221
00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:17.023
Sheriff pays you as well as
he pays me. probably better.

222
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:23.360
- Anyhow I might get something
to satisfy my sweet tooth.

223
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:27.670
Want me to get you anything?

224
00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:29.980
- Something sharp.

225
00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:33.504
- You're going to need more than that

226
00:19:33.504 --> 00:19:34.740
to get your way out of here.

227
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:38.810
- There's only one man I'm aiming to kill.

228
00:19:49.557 --> 00:19:53.167
- Get! (growls)

229
00:19:53.167 --> 00:19:54.334
Get out of it.

230
00:19:58.561 --> 00:20:02.640
(tense orchestral music)

231
00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.390
You ain't been gone long enough to.

232
00:20:05.344 --> 00:20:10.070
(tense orchestral music continues)

233
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:12.153
- Let him out and take his chains off.

234
00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.470
- Ma'am?

235
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:18.580
(tense orchestral music continues)

236
00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:20.033
- Set the prisoner free.

237
00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.229
- Mabel. don't do this.

238
00:20:24.229 --> 00:20:27.867
- [Merriweather] What the
hell are you thinking?

239
00:20:27.867 --> 00:20:30.023
- That I don't want to kill you.

240
00:20:32.109 --> 00:20:33.385
(Mabel gasps)

241
00:20:33.385 --> 00:20:35.221
(gunshot blasting)
(Paul gasps)

242
00:20:35.221 --> 00:20:36.780
(Merriweather grunts)

243
00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.110
- You shot me!

244
00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:39.610
- Get out of here!

245
00:20:44.762 --> 00:20:47.500
(Merriweather grunts)

246
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:48.333
- Lemmy!

247
00:20:49.682 --> 00:20:50.515
Lemmy!

248
00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:53.490
(tense orchestral music)

249
00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:54.323
Lemmy!

250
00:20:58.504 --> 00:21:00.610
- Where are they?

251
00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:02.888
The keys!
- Shouldn't have done this.

252
00:21:02.888 --> 00:21:04.963
- Paul. where are they?

253
00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:07.500
- He's got them.

254
00:21:09.938 --> 00:21:11.917
- Lemmy!
- Mabel. no!

255
00:21:15.572 --> 00:21:17.155
- Give me the keys!

256
00:21:18.424 --> 00:21:23.424
- Shoot the!
(gunshot blasting)

257
00:21:39.792 --> 00:21:43.209
(tense orchestral music)

258
00:21:50.687 --> 00:21:52.662
- Mabel. you have to get out of here.

259
00:21:52.662 --> 00:21:53.880
(lock clanking)

260
00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:55.080
- There's no going back.

261
00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.300
They'll be coming.

262
00:21:59.275 --> 00:22:02.331
(Mabel pants)
(tense orchestral music)

263
00:22:02.331 --> 00:22:04.490
(shackles clanking)

264
00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:05.727
- Horses?

265
00:22:05.727 --> 00:22:07.894
- I didn't think that far.

266
00:22:09.545 --> 00:22:10.652
(Mabel gasps)

267
00:22:10.652 --> 00:22:12.139
Head to the corral.

268
00:22:12.139 --> 00:22:13.806
Are you ready?
- Yes.

269
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:17.725
(gunshot popping)
(Mabel gasps)

270
00:22:17.725 --> 00:22:18.642
- Get down!

271
00:22:19.978 --> 00:22:24.188
(tense orchestral music)

272
00:22:24.188 --> 00:22:26.749
(gunshot popping)
(Mabel shrieks)

273
00:22:26.749 --> 00:22:28.453
(shutter clattering)

274
00:22:28.453 --> 00:22:30.910
- What damn fool's
interrupting my breakfast?

275
00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:32.570
- There's shooting out there.
- Sheriff. you gotta come!

276
00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:34.170
- The hell's going on out there?

277
00:22:35.827 --> 00:22:37.983
- Merriweather's lying
in the street. Sheriff.

278
00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:40.053
With his guts shot out.

279
00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.090
Mabel's inside the jail.

280
00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:44.073
- Mabel Williams?

281
00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:46.000
- Sheriff. I think she's-

282
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:46.833
- Fetch Jonathan.

283
00:22:46.833 --> 00:22:48.383
- But Sheriff. I-
- Now!

284
00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:53.453
Every man with a gun. follow me!

285
00:22:54.844 --> 00:22:58.576
(tense orchestral music)

286
00:22:58.576 --> 00:23:00.993
(Bob grunts)

287
00:23:02.198 --> 00:23:04.140
- Come on. get down. son.

288
00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:05.530
Come on. there's no sense in this.

289
00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:07.120
- [Pastor] Careful!

290
00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:07.953
- [Lemmy] Jon.

291
00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:09.743
Jon!

292
00:23:09.743 --> 00:23:10.576
- He's busy.

293
00:23:10.576 --> 00:23:12.210
- Merriweather's been shot.

294
00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:13.730
Paul's fixing to escape.

295
00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:15.250
Mabel's inside the jail.

296
00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:16.083
- No. she's not.

297
00:23:16.083 --> 00:23:17.040
- I seen her myself.

298
00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.640
She's gone in the jail with him.

299
00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.140
- Go home and see that she's there.

300
00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:25.010
- I told you. I seen her with my own eyes.

301
00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:26.430
- You heard what I said.

302
00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:27.543
- What about the boy?

303
00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:33.013
- [Jonathan] He's safer up
there than anywhere else.

304
00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.520
- Goddamn. Smithey. I owe you a drink.

305
00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:49.220
- He's still inside?

306
00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:51.190
- Yeah. Smithey here's
been holding him down.

307
00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:53.690
- Yeah. me and two other
fellas. we got them surrounded.

308
00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:54.650
They'd gotten away

309
00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:55.700
if we hadn't-
- Hey!

310
00:23:56.558 --> 00:23:59.060
When are you gonna finish my shave?

311
00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:00.710
- Soon as it gets back to normal.

312
00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.940
- You seen any sign of my wife?

313
00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:09.040
- No.

314
00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:10.910
Heard that shotgun blast.

315
00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:13.800
so I came out of the shop
to see what's going on.

316
00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.590
Always bring my rifle when
I hear a shotgun blast.

317
00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:18.590
- [Jonathan] Sheriff. she's inside.

318
00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:22.693
- She's probably a hostage.
if she's still alive.

319
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:26.630
We would've killed him this morning.

320
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:30.880
- I will now.

321
00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:31.750
(gun clicking)

322
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:33.360
- [Sheriff] What?

323
00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.243
- Damn. he ain't kidding.

324
00:24:38.036 --> 00:24:41.400
(gunshot popping)

325
00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.833
- Let her out. you hear me?

326
00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:46.427
She's got nothing to do with this!

327
00:24:46.427 --> 00:24:49.260
(gunshot popping)

328
00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:55.647
Mabel.
(gunshot popping)

329
00:24:55.647 --> 00:24:58.810
- Either that son of a bitch is a bad shot

330
00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:00.763
or I reckon-
- He doesn't want to kill him.

331
00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:09.160
- What did I miss?

332
00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:20.313
- Well. he can't stay in there forever.

333
00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:22.820
- Marshal will be here soon.

334
00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:24.773
- Yeah. he's due around noon.

335
00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.400
- Hey. Smithey.

336
00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.650
You ready for that drink?

337
00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:42.800
- Damn.

338
00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.270
Sheriff. you know I can't
hold a glass of whiskey

339
00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:46.723
and this rifle all at once.

340
00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:50.593
Hell. maybe in my younger years.

341
00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:57.523
- Deputy?

342
00:25:58.740 --> 00:25:59.630
- Not thirsty.

343
00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:05.090
- Well. (clears throat) if they come out.

344
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:06.640
I want to be the first to know.

345
00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:13.197
- They?

346
00:26:13.197 --> 00:26:16.614
(tense orchestral music)

347
00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:22.090
- We use you for ransom.

348
00:26:24.621 --> 00:26:25.721
We'll get some horses.

349
00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:29.970
and we'll slip past them.

350
00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:33.663
They don't know why you're here.

351
00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:35.453
- He knows.

352
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:37.320
Or he will. soon.

353
00:26:42.675 --> 00:26:44.842
- You don't belong to him.

354
00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.820
And our fate doesn't. to any of them.

355
00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:53.240
Hey. we'll find a way.

356
00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.907
(dramatic orchestral music)

357
00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:01.773
- Mrs. Williams.

358
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:05.683
I know you ain't here.

359
00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:08.923
Mabel?

360
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:12.883
Making supper.

361
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:15.933
Dumb bastard. told you
she was in the jail.

362
00:27:17.192 --> 00:27:21.692
(dramatic orchestral music continues)

363
00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:05.590
Where's the sheriff at?

364
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:07.690
- Oh. he's over there wetting his whistle.

365
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:10.783
- Jonathan.

366
00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.151
Mabel wasn't at the house.

367
00:28:15.151 --> 00:28:17.773
- (chuckling) No. she's in the jail.

368
00:28:18.756 --> 00:28:20.723
- (chuckling sarcastically) Uh-huh.

369
00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:41.253
- Between you and me.
I never liked him much.

370
00:28:43.336 --> 00:28:45.380
(footsteps clattering)

371
00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.090
- Sheriff?

372
00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:47.923
- [Bob] What do you want?

373
00:28:47.923 --> 00:28:48.756
- It's me. Lemmy.

374
00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:53.463
- No shit.

375
00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:57.190
- I've been doing some thinking

376
00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.090
and I've come to thinking

377
00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:04.833
I know why Mabel's in there with him.

378
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:09.643
- Well?

379
00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.363
- Never had no wife before.

380
00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:19.920
so I guess I've never had no horse thief

381
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.263
take her captive. neither.

382
00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:28.163
Also. I've never used a rifle on a man.

383
00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:33.363
Or any other gun for that matter.

384
00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:37.053
Just rabbits.

385
00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.073
Lots of them.

386
00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:48.150
- Deputy. I'd like to bend
your ear for a moment.

387
00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:58.043
Jonathan. does it puzzle
you as it puzzles me

388
00:29:58.043 --> 00:30:00.760
that Mabel found herself inside the jail?

389
00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.360
- I plan on asking her that question

390
00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:04.910
after I deliver her and shoot the bastard.

391
00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:08.663
- See. I went in that saloon
to kinda ponder things.

392
00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:12.513
Sort of see things more clear-like.

393
00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:15.910
- Sheriff. if you have something to say

394
00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:18.160
I'd prefer you just say it outright.

395
00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.513
- I think you already know.

396
00:30:21.125 --> 00:30:22.470
It was your wife that broke in there

397
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:24.430
and tried to break him out.

398
00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:27.470
Most likely. it was your
wife that shot my jailer.

399
00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:29.163
She's the cause all of this mess.

400
00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:36.833
Deputy. will you stand by
as nothing but a cuckold?

401
00:30:39.646 --> 00:30:42.229
(bell tolling)

402
00:31:13.347 --> 00:31:15.097
- I was wrong. Mabel.

403
00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:19.693
We might not leave this place.

404
00:31:24.075 --> 00:31:26.575
(Mabel sighs)

405
00:31:27.731 --> 00:31:29.481
- Whatever happens...

406
00:31:32.474 --> 00:31:34.254
It'll be together.

407
00:31:34.254 --> 00:31:39.254
(dramatic orchestral music)
(wind whirring)

408
00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.973
- Marshal Graham. I'm Lemmy.

409
00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:48.747
Pleased to meet you.

410
00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:57.160
- I assume he is still alive?

411
00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.560
- Well. yes. I wouldn't kill
him without you being here.

412
00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:02.570
- Well. I must speak with
him as soon as possible.

413
00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:04.113
- That isn't possible.

414
00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:07.553
At the moment.

415
00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:12.350
- [Graham] Oh. I see.

416
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:13.183
- Never fails.

417
00:33:13.183 --> 00:33:15.223
I'm gone a few minutes and crap happens.

418
00:33:19.555 --> 00:33:21.150
- I assume he's in the jail?

419
00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:21.983
- With his wife.

420
00:33:23.464 --> 00:33:25.964
(tense music)

421
00:33:28.175 --> 00:33:30.870
(Graham sighs)

422
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:32.603
- You've clearly laid siege.

423
00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:36.310
Has he tried to escape with his prisoner?

424
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:38.473
- We've got riflemen on all sides.

425
00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:45.240
- I made sure he couldn't go anywhere.

426
00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.590
- He's trapped in there
like a fox in his hole.

427
00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:52.270
- There are more clever
ways to catch a fox

428
00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:53.420
than with one of those.

429
00:33:54.456 --> 00:33:56.173
- I just noticed you ain't carrying.

430
00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.893
- Never saw a need for such a thing.

431
00:34:01.979 --> 00:34:05.224
(suspenseful music)

432
00:34:05.224 --> 00:34:07.352
- What? Hey. wait!

433
00:34:07.352 --> 00:34:10.431
(suspenseful music continues)
(gunshot popping)

434
00:34:10.431 --> 00:34:12.043
(door clattering)

435
00:34:12.043 --> 00:34:15.876
(suspenseful music continues)

436
00:34:26.655 --> 00:34:27.488
- Jon!

437
00:34:27.488 --> 00:34:32.488
(gunshot blasting)
(Mabel shrieks)

438
00:34:34.152 --> 00:34:36.652
(Mabel pants)

439
00:34:38.971 --> 00:34:41.383
- What the hell was that?

440
00:34:41.383 --> 00:34:42.733
I should have you arrested.

441
00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.400
Do you hear me?
- Leave him be.

442
00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:49.863
Find someone to stop the
blood. or do it yourself.

443
00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:52.573
- Lemmy. go fetch Mrs. Wade.

444
00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:58.710
- A place for conversation?

445
00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:01.023
- This way.

446
00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.123
- You as well.

447
00:35:08.526 --> 00:35:11.193
(door creaking)

448
00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:21.471
(Paul grunts)

449
00:35:21.471 --> 00:35:24.054
(both panting)

450
00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:31.990
- Is he going to be okay? (panting)

451
00:35:35.646 --> 00:35:36.479
- Yeah.

452
00:35:37.339 --> 00:35:39.839
(Mabel pants)

453
00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:02.760
- I did not mean to cause all this.

454
00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.363
- No. you didn't.

455
00:36:11.285 --> 00:36:14.118
(bullet clinking)

456
00:36:15.435 --> 00:36:18.018
(Mabel sniffs)

457
00:36:23.656 --> 00:36:26.989
(background chattering)

458
00:36:32.231 --> 00:36:33.910
- You have a parlor?

459
00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:35.041
Private room?

460
00:36:35.041 --> 00:36:35.967
- Marshal.
- Marshal!

461
00:36:35.967 --> 00:36:37.217
- Not that comes to mind.

462
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:44.190
Everyone!

463
00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:45.023
Leave!

464
00:36:49.916 --> 00:36:53.583
(dramatic orchestral music)

465
00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:08.943
(Bob sighs)

466
00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:14.870
Shouldn't she be gone. too?

467
00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:31.843
- Mrs. Wade?

468
00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:35.010
That is your name?

469
00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:35.843
- It is.

470
00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:41.803
- Mrs. Wade. you are
privy to a conversation.

471
00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:46.440
one that is going to mention things

472
00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:49.083
not to be spoken outside this room.

473
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:52.640
I trust you understand?

474
00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:56.690
- I do.

475
00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:57.523
- Do you?

476
00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:00.943
- Yes. sir.

477
00:38:09.692 --> 00:38:13.080
- (chuckling) I suppose.
by now. gentlemen.

478
00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:17.880
it would be pointless to retrace the steps

479
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:25.403
that led us to this
situation across the street.

480
00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:29.493
I must say. though. (chuckling)

481
00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:33.853
I find it compelling.

482
00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:41.090
almost with a touch of Shakespeare

483
00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:46.090
that your wife (chuckling)

484
00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:52.160
has become not only a prominent figure

485
00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:54.053
in this current action.

486
00:38:55.140 --> 00:39:00.140
but is. in fact. the cause
of our current trouble.

487
00:39:02.098 --> 00:39:05.765
(dramatic orchestral music)

488
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:15.470
Sheriff. I assume you have
exhausted all strategies?

489
00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:20.763
- Well. we storm them out.

490
00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:23.383
Men in front. men behind.

491
00:39:24.561 --> 00:39:27.563
and we throw a torch in
there. smoke them out.

492
00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.560
They won't burn to death.

493
00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:31.470
They want to live. I guarantee that.

494
00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:34.556
When they come out. we grab them.

495
00:39:34.556 --> 00:39:36.606
If they come out shooting. we shoot them.

496
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:40.963
Otherwise. we hang him as planned.

497
00:39:44.316 --> 00:39:46.580
(Graham sighs)

498
00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:49.563
- I take no pleasure in repeating myself.

499
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:57.450
Paul does not die

500
00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:01.963
until I've given my word.

501
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:06.770
- What use does he have alive?

502
00:40:08.153 --> 00:40:12.653
(dramatic orchestral music continues)

503
00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:21.980
- This horse thief. I
followed for some time.

504
00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:25.173
You might say I've been on his trail.

505
00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:33.330
Not too long ago. he
seized a certain animal.

506
00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:37.703
Not any regular animal.

507
00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:44.730
a prized stallion from
Belle Meade. in Tennessee.

508
00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:50.540
The thief apprehended the beast

509
00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:54.053
while it was being
transported from back east.

510
00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:59.740
Then. not a week ago. he
brought this stolen property

511
00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.850
to a ranch not far from here.

512
00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:05.293
owned by a man named Timberlake.

513
00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:08.800
- Please try and keep still.

514
00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:12.363
- This Timberlake.

515
00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:17.920
it is not clear if he was
an associate of Paul's

516
00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.313
or merely a pawn in his scheme.

517
00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:22.920
Nevertheless. he was-

518
00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.103
- Killed dead.

519
00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:31.630
- I see word travels fast.

520
00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:34.023
As you say. the rancher was murdered.

521
00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:39.850
perhaps by the horse thief.

522
00:41:39.850 --> 00:41:42.850
or it could have been by the
man who purchased the stallion.

523
00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.593
- What man? Do you have a name?

524
00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:51.073
- I have not been able to find it.

525
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:55.683
but his tracks. and those of the horse.

526
00:41:56.550 --> 00:42:01.550
I'd followed a great deal. and
they are nowhere to be found.

527
00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:05.700
So. I must speak to Paul

528
00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:09.743
to learn who has taken what's been stolen.

529
00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:13.483
to find where they've taken it.

530
00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:18.650
and to return this invaluable possession

531
00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:20.710
to its rightful owner.

532
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:21.543
- I'm finished.

533
00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:25.853
- As I said.

534
00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:38.810
Sheriff. I believe the
right course of action

535
00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:40.620
is to lure them out.

536
00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:44.050
perhaps with a promise of freedom.

537
00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:47.090
or else. even their courage
might get the best of them.

538
00:42:57.570 --> 00:42:59.120
Deputy. what are your thoughts?

539
00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:04.033
What might you do to get your wife back?

540
00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:08.303
- She's no longer my wife.

541
00:43:12.678 --> 00:43:13.650
(smacks table)

542
00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:15.290
- Goddamn.

543
00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:17.727
Marshal. you wait right here and see.

544
00:43:21.838 --> 00:43:24.588
(doors creaking)

545
00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:40.093
- Iago?

546
00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:43.830
- Lemmy.

547
00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:46.583
Well. Lamule is the
name my mother gave me.

548
00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:55.000
- Thank you. Pastor. for
making me feel so at home.

549
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.820
I surely like it here.

550
00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:58.300
You are very kind.

551
00:43:58.300 --> 00:43:59.473
- You are very welcome.

552
00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:04.400
Sheriff. will you please get him down?

553
00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:05.330
- That's what I'm here for.

554
00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:06.163
- Thank you.

555
00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:09.600
This is Lenie Muller.

556
00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:11.100
She just arrived from Germany.

557
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:14.284
- Welcome to America. hold my horse.

558
00:44:14.284 --> 00:44:16.040
(suspenseful music)

559
00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:18.075
- No!
(gunshot blasting)

560
00:44:18.075 --> 00:44:21.075
(suspenseful music)

561
00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:44.590
- [Bob] Hey. horse thief!

562
00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:48.193
Look'ee here!

563
00:44:50.472 --> 00:44:51.555
Got your boy!

564
00:44:58.326 --> 00:45:00.885
(Mabel whimpers)

565
00:45:00.885 --> 00:45:05.885
You were so preoccupied. I
decided to use the rope on him.

566
00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:08.057
- Fool's errand.

567
00:45:08.057 --> 00:45:11.890
(suspenseful music continues)

568
00:45:14.868 --> 00:45:19.370
- You come on out now. and
I just might let you live.

569
00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:20.743
Mrs. Williams. too.

570
00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:28.350
You should have seen him fly.

571
00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:31.009
He flew like a goddamn bird! (chuckling)

572
00:45:31.009 --> 00:45:33.926
(gunshot blasting)

573
00:45:42.856 --> 00:45:45.493
- They'll kill us now. won't they?

574
00:45:45.493 --> 00:45:46.326
- No.

575
00:45:50.407 --> 00:45:52.007
Not until he asks what he wants.

576
00:45:57.987 --> 00:46:00.404
Then. we just save our lives.

577
00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.803
- Should we go pick him up?

578
00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:08.460
- There's really no reason for it.

579
00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:21.403
You may want to go retrieve
that symbol of authority.

580
00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:25.993
It's yours now.

581
00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:31.430
After all. this man's too conflicted

582
00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:37.043
for such responsibility.

583
00:46:51.976 --> 00:46:54.726
(doors creaking)

584
00:47:06.105 --> 00:47:06.938
(gunshot popping)

585
00:47:06.938 --> 00:47:07.883
- [Lemmy] Oh. Jesus!

586
00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:11.010
- We know he's a better shot than that.

587
00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:11.843
- No shit.

588
00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:20.700
- Graham!

589
00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:23.323
- [Smithey] Well. this
ought to be interesting.

590
00:47:28.795 --> 00:47:31.545
(doors creaking)

591
00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:47.158
- Shoot him.

592
00:47:47.158 --> 00:47:49.883
- No.

593
00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:53.243
Mabel!

594
00:47:54.968 --> 00:47:55.801
Not yet.

595
00:47:57.544 --> 00:48:00.044
(gun cocking)

596
00:48:29.726 --> 00:48:32.309
(badge clinks)

597
00:48:44.346 --> 00:48:45.263
- Murderer.

598
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:51.053
- Now. let's not waste time with insult.

599
00:48:53.550 --> 00:48:55.863
Anyway. I didn't kill the boy.

600
00:48:56.790 --> 00:48:58.040
- You might as well have.

601
00:48:59.815 --> 00:49:01.815
and there's no telling who will be next.

602
00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:08.990
- Are we going to discuss
our business affairs

603
00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:12.840
or is she gonna shoot me in the back?

604
00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:17.193
- Well. she might.

605
00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:25.803
- Where is it?

606
00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:29.743
The stallion.

607
00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:37.913
You are aware that I am your
only means of deliverance?

608
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.573
- I know you'll shoot me. Graham.

609
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:50.653
What about her?

610
00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:56.063
- The hero.

611
00:49:58.090 --> 00:50:01.413
Always more concerned for
the woman than himself.

612
00:50:02.707 --> 00:50:07.493
- Oh. we're all villains here.
Graham. of varying degrees.

613
00:50:11.010 --> 00:50:12.870
- She may live.

614
00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:14.913
I have no ill will toward her.

615
00:50:18.330 --> 00:50:20.250
but I can't speak for
what her husband might do.

616
00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:22.483
You see. he's quite upset.

617
00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:33.953
- I'll show you where the horse is.

618
00:50:35.010 --> 00:50:36.133
Give us till dark.

619
00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:43.073
- I see.

620
00:50:44.673 --> 00:50:45.913
A bittersweet farewell.

621
00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:50.773
Not past 12.

622
00:50:52.810 --> 00:50:54.017
- Oh. we'll come out.

623
00:51:02.596 --> 00:51:06.346
- "And we have heard
the chimes of midnight."

624
00:51:07.829 --> 00:51:09.253
Or we soon shall.

625
00:51:11.408 --> 00:51:14.491
(footsteps clomping)

626
00:51:33.779 --> 00:51:37.612
When the town's fast
asleep. they'll come out.

627
00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:39.993
- What happens then?

628
00:51:45.090 --> 00:51:50.090
- I think it best that
this be a private matter.

629
00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:51.063
- Oh.

630
00:51:52.530 --> 00:51:53.363
Yes. sir.

631
00:51:55.190 --> 00:52:00.143
I believe I have enough material
to write the first edition.

632
00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:08.463
- [Graham] You have
proven yourself useful.

633
00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:11.023
- Yes. sir.

634
00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:13.863
I ain't going nowhere.

635
00:52:17.770 --> 00:52:21.863
- Sheriff. I trust you'll stand by.

636
00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:27.763
- By your side.

637
00:52:31.210 --> 00:52:32.543
- And I am to wait.

638
00:52:35.021 --> 00:52:38.293
"Though waiting so be hell."

639
00:52:38.293 --> 00:52:41.043
(dramatic music)

640
00:52:59.213 --> 00:53:01.963
(customer sighs)

641
00:53:10.178 --> 00:53:13.761
(dramatic music continues)

642
00:53:41.399 --> 00:53:44.232
(hooves clomping)

643
00:53:47.515 --> 00:53:51.098
(dramatic music continues)

644
00:54:37.505 --> 00:54:40.172
(body scraping)

645
00:55:02.677 --> 00:55:04.888
- Would you like another. Jon?

646
00:55:04.888 --> 00:55:07.388
(Jonathan grunts)

647
00:55:07.388 --> 00:55:09.138
- I'll have one more.

648
00:55:11.307 --> 00:55:12.183
Did you hear me?

649
00:55:15.714 --> 00:55:19.232
(whiskey trickling)

650
00:55:19.232 --> 00:55:22.149
(glasses clinking)

651
00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:36.340
Where'd everyone run off?

652
00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:37.173
- Home.

653
00:55:38.790 --> 00:55:40.003
Where we all should be.

654
00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:44.913
- There's no home to go back to.

655
00:55:50.759 --> 00:55:53.509
(Jonathan sighs)

656
00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:59.153
You wear it on the inside.

657
00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:05.587
so they don't know who you
are unless you want them to.

658
00:56:16.633 --> 00:56:19.300
(ominous music)

659
00:56:35.435 --> 00:56:37.685
- I'm gonna relieve myself.

660
00:56:38.862 --> 00:56:40.779
- [Barman] You do that.

661
00:56:41.919 --> 00:56:44.752
(door clattering)

662
00:56:45.727 --> 00:56:49.227
(ominous music continues)

663
00:56:52.753 --> 00:56:55.730
- I'll check on him to make
sure he doesn't fall in.

664
00:56:55.730 --> 00:56:57.703
- Would it be so bad if he did?

665
00:56:59.727 --> 00:57:03.227
(ominous music continues)

666
00:57:06.669 --> 00:57:09.669
(urine splattering)

667
00:57:12.831 --> 00:57:14.581
- What's that letter?

668
00:57:15.644 --> 00:57:16.477
In your coat?

669
00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:21.230
- Ain't none of your concern.

670
00:57:22.623 --> 00:57:26.123
(ominous music continues)

671
00:57:33.902 --> 00:57:36.699
(both grunt)

672
00:57:36.699 --> 00:57:39.282
(Lemmy grunts)

673
00:57:41.765 --> 00:57:44.265
(Lemmy wails)

674
00:57:45.696 --> 00:57:48.613
(punches thumping)

675
00:57:50.048 --> 00:57:52.631
(Lemmy groans)

676
00:57:53.809 --> 00:57:57.309
(ominous music continues)

677
00:57:58.638 --> 00:58:01.220
(Lemmy grunts)

678
00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:02.808
You can't do this!

679
00:58:02.808 --> 00:58:05.540
(Lemmy grunts)

680
00:58:05.540 --> 00:58:08.963
I'm the sheriff!
(Jonathan grunts)

681
00:58:10.652 --> 00:58:13.652
(crickets chirping)

682
00:58:45.577 --> 00:58:47.762
- [Mabel] "For my husband.

683
00:58:47.762 --> 00:58:50.750
(thoughtful piano music)

684
00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:54.713
I have not been your
wife for some time now.

685
00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:00.743
And. perhaps I never was.

686
00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:05.337
in the ways that you wanted.

687
00:59:10.415 --> 00:59:14.370
You will remember this
Sunday. four weeks past.

688
00:59:14.370 --> 00:59:17.060
when the widower. Timberlake.
lost his own wife.

689
00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:27.207
(dramatic orchestral music)

690
00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:31.573
He was alone. and shouldn't be.

691
00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:45.143
The lie I told to myself.

692
00:59:46.030 --> 00:59:48.713
that you would be glad
to see me go awhile.

693
00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:52.323
was the turn side of the truth.

694
00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:57.433
I did not know it yet.

695
00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:01.283
but it was I who wanted to be gone.

696
01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:06.913
To be free.

697
01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:14.823
And that is something I
didn't know was missing.

698
01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:17.333
until I felt it.

699
01:00:25.070 --> 01:00:29.483
I think a woman doesn't know
what it means to be on her own.

700
01:00:30.830 --> 01:00:33.170
She grows up with her mother

701
01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:35.473
and her father telling her. keeping her.

702
01:00:38.490 --> 01:00:42.693
And before she's old
enough. a man comes along.

703
01:00:45.173 --> 01:00:48.006
(water trickling)

704
01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:53.403
She has no time.

705
01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:59.403
She doesn't really know if
anything is for her. because.

706
01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:05.897
she's never really been just her."

707
01:01:07.361 --> 01:01:09.444
- [Paul] Get up. come on!

708
01:01:10.633 --> 01:01:11.466
Get up!

709
01:01:13.753 --> 01:01:14.586
Get up!

710
01:01:16.391 --> 01:01:21.391
Go!

711
01:01:21.763 --> 01:01:22.596
Yah.

712
01:01:23.965 --> 01:01:28.465
(dramatic orchestral music continues)

713
01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:40.923
- Mabel. my sister's son. Paul.

714
01:01:41.790 --> 01:01:42.623
- Ma'am.

715
01:01:43.621 --> 01:01:48.121
(dramatic orchestral music continues)

716
01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:55.070
Looks like you've never
seen a horse before.

717
01:01:58.852 --> 01:02:02.003
- I have.

718
01:02:02.003 --> 01:02:06.503
(dramatic orchestral music continues)

719
01:02:14.810 --> 01:02:16.510
- Where did you get this one from?

720
01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:22.044
He eats like a bear but it
looks like his mama was a wolf.

721
01:02:22.044 --> 01:02:23.436
(Paul laughs)

722
01:02:23.436 --> 01:02:24.730
- Oh. trust me. when he ain't eating.

723
01:02:24.730 --> 01:02:27.212
he's talking too much to be either.

724
01:02:27.212 --> 01:02:31.326
- It's true.

725
01:02:31.326 --> 01:02:34.290
- Where'd you find this one?

726
01:02:34.290 --> 01:02:38.263
- She's been helping me
through ever since Mary passed.

727
01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:41.123
- Thank you.

728
01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:48.860
- Where are the horses from?

729
01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:50.953
- Many places.

730
01:02:52.576 --> 01:02:56.403
Why?

731
01:02:56.403 --> 01:02:58.463
- That white horse is beautiful.

732
01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:01.943
Were they wild?

733
01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:04.253
- Yeah.

734
01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:10.420
- What are you gonna do with them?

735
01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:12.423
- He brought them here to sell. Mabel.

736
01:03:13.857 --> 01:03:18.357
(dramatic orchestral music continues)

737
01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:21.210
- When?

738
01:03:21.210 --> 01:03:22.043
- Tomorrow.

739
01:03:31.687 --> 01:03:33.690
(Marcus clears throat)

740
01:03:33.690 --> 01:03:36.256
- Can I have some more peas. please?

741
01:03:36.256 --> 01:03:37.556
- Of course.
- Thank you.

742
01:03:38.783 --> 01:03:41.616
(dishes clinking)

743
01:03:42.453 --> 01:03:46.953
(dramatic orchestral music continues)

744
01:03:59.897 --> 01:04:01.647
- [Mabel] "I wanted to believe him.

745
01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:05.097
but some part of me knew."

746
01:04:07.621 --> 01:04:12.121
(dramatic orchestral music continues)

747
01:04:41.573 --> 01:04:44.406
(hooves clomping)

748
01:04:53.414 --> 01:04:54.497
- [Paul] Yah!

749
01:04:56.025 --> 01:04:56.858
Pull in.

750
01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:06.210
- Where'd you really find those horses?

751
01:05:06.210 --> 01:05:08.350
They all got brands on them.

752
01:05:08.350 --> 01:05:10.960
The stallion. it's not wild.

753
01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:12.023
- It was. once.

754
01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:14.443
Just as you are. once.

755
01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:21.870
- I'll be headed to town
now. to fetch my husband.

756
01:05:21.870 --> 01:05:23.470
He'll be along shortly with the sheriff.

757
01:05:23.470 --> 01:05:24.553
I suggest you leave.

758
01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:27.790
Those horses aren't yours to sell!

759
01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:28.940
- Yeah. and why's that?

760
01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:32.000
Huh?

761
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.150
Someone else stole them first.

762
01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:36.220
They were taken from their land.

763
01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:37.680
From their own.

764
01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:38.513
So. what does it mean

765
01:05:38.513 --> 01:05:41.123
that I took something that was
never theirs to begin with?

766
01:05:43.705 --> 01:05:45.149
(dramatic music)

767
01:05:45.149 --> 01:05:48.149
- Then. why don't you sit them free?

768
01:05:49.671 --> 01:05:51.783
- I think it's you that
wants to be set free.

769
01:05:55.646 --> 01:05:58.807
If you want to go. I ain't stopping you.

770
01:05:58.807 --> 01:06:01.453
You tell the sheriff. but I ain't leaving.

771
01:06:04.487 --> 01:06:06.337
- [Mabel] "I should have come to you.

772
01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:09.853
Part of me will never know why I didn't.

773
01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:20.523
When I returned. a stranger had arrived.

774
01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:27.567
He'd come for the white horse."

775
01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:29.920
- That's my final offer.

776
01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:33.790
Does it not suit you?

777
01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:37.043
- It's not for sale.

778
01:06:39.193 --> 01:06:42.610
(tense orchestral music)

779
01:06:43.590 --> 01:06:46.290
- I've traveled a good
distance to make this purchase.

780
01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:51.203
and I don't intend to
leave until it's complete.

781
01:06:52.352 --> 01:06:54.010
(tense music continues)

782
01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:55.610
- Marcus. go tend to the horses.

783
01:06:57.461 --> 01:06:59.890
- But I just did!
- Move. boy.

784
01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:00.723
Move.

785
01:07:01.575 --> 01:07:04.908
(tense music continues)

786
01:07:08.908 --> 01:07:11.575
(door clatters)

787
01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:14.810
- There's nothing for
purchase around here.

788
01:07:16.350 --> 01:07:17.260
so I think it'd be best

789
01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:20.086
if you hop on your horse and you get out.

790
01:07:20.086 --> 01:07:22.669
(Graham sighs)

791
01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:25.130
- If there's another buyer-

792
01:07:25.130 --> 01:07:26.614
- There isn't.

793
01:07:26.614 --> 01:07:30.801
(tense orchestral music continues)

794
01:07:30.801 --> 01:07:34.468
Those horses are
rightfully owned by no one.

795
01:07:35.512 --> 01:07:38.095
(Graham sighs)

796
01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:43.593
- By my recollection.

797
01:07:46.070 --> 01:07:47.800
we had an agreement.

798
01:07:58.870 --> 01:08:01.560
Are you aware that the authorities

799
01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:03.593
might want to know your whereabouts?

800
01:08:08.447 --> 01:08:10.403
- I'm aware of who you are.

801
01:08:12.490 --> 01:08:13.990
and I don't think it'd look very good

802
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:16.223
for a marshal to be buying stolen horses.

803
01:08:19.727 --> 01:08:20.560
Would it?

804
01:08:28.110 --> 01:08:29.027
- Godspeed.

805
01:08:31.484 --> 01:08:35.151
(dramatic orchestral music)

806
01:09:03.670 --> 01:09:06.923
- I'm a-guessing she has
something to do with this.

807
01:09:11.810 --> 01:09:13.120
Wouldn't be the first time

808
01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:16.440
you've went after something
that wasn't yours.

809
01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:18.543
- She's free to do what she wants.

810
01:09:23.108 --> 01:09:27.025
- Well. what do you want
to do with the horses?

811
01:09:33.702 --> 01:09:35.668
- Let them go.

812
01:09:35.668 --> 01:09:40.168
(dramatic orchestral music continues)

813
01:09:47.977 --> 01:09:51.980
- "And later that same
day. he honored his word.

814
01:09:54.667 --> 01:09:59.167
(dramatic orchestral music continues)

815
01:10:11.066 --> 01:10:14.070
As I watched them run free I felt.

816
01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:16.889
for the first time in my life.

817
01:10:16.889 --> 01:10:19.065
(hooves clomping)

818
01:10:19.065 --> 01:10:20.027
I was. too."

819
01:10:22.950 --> 01:10:24.500
Why did you change your course?

820
01:10:30.990 --> 01:10:33.310
- Maybe I've been going
the wrong direction

821
01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:34.143
for awhile now.

822
01:10:36.241 --> 01:10:38.841
It only took a small touch
to send me the other way.

823
01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:52.670
- When I was very young. I
would sneak out of my window

824
01:10:52.670 --> 01:10:54.823
after my father went to sleep.

825
01:10:57.830 --> 01:11:01.423
and I'd just wander around
in the woods for hours.

826
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:07.163
not scared of the dark.
not afraid to be alone.

827
01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:14.660
One night. I saw this
beautiful white mare.

828
01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:21.823
She was moving through the
thicket and she came so close.

829
01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:24.170
I could almost touch her.

830
01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:33.370
The next morning. my father
put boards on the window.

831
01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:39.483
and not a month after that.
I saw that white mare.

832
01:11:42.230 --> 01:11:47.230
She was in a stable on the edge of town.

833
01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:52.363
She had been broken in.

834
01:11:55.770 --> 01:11:58.370
and she did not look at all
like she did that night.

835
01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:02.233
but I knew it was her.

836
01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:08.880
- You don't belong to me. Mabel.

837
01:12:12.379 --> 01:12:15.092
Or to any man. for that matter.

838
01:12:15.092 --> 01:12:19.592
(dramatic orchestral music continues)

839
01:12:33.557 --> 01:12:37.436
- "I cannot describe these horrors."

840
01:12:37.436 --> 01:12:39.374
Oh. my God!
- Marcus!

841
01:12:39.374 --> 01:12:42.162
Hey. hey. Marcus.
- Oh my!

842
01:12:42.162 --> 01:12:45.052
- Whoa. whoa. oh. oh. Marcus!

843
01:12:45.052 --> 01:12:46.781
Marcus!
(Mabel sobs)

844
01:12:46.781 --> 01:12:48.261
Who did this?

845
01:12:48.261 --> 01:12:49.544
Who did it?

846
01:12:49.544 --> 01:12:50.840
Marcus.

847
01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:52.377
You're okay.

848
01:12:52.377 --> 01:12:53.827
- [Mabel] "But I can tell you

849
01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:57.797
that I have never seen such evil."

850
01:12:58.937 --> 01:13:03.437
(dramatic orchestral music continues)

851
01:13:40.305 --> 01:13:42.553
(Mabel sighs)

852
01:13:42.553 --> 01:13:45.053
- Mabel. you need to get home.

853
01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:46.873
- No.

854
01:13:49.210 --> 01:13:52.020
- I don't know what's gonna happen. okay?

855
01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:53.823
But I do know that if you stay here.

856
01:13:55.064 --> 01:13:56.113
it won't get any better.

857
01:13:57.615 --> 01:14:01.532
(melancholic orchestral music)

858
01:14:13.157 --> 01:14:15.357
- [Mabel] "A couple of
days after my return.

859
01:14:16.230 --> 01:14:19.450
the word around town was
they captured a horse thief

860
01:14:19.450 --> 01:14:21.673
upon orders from the county marshal.

861
01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:32.743
I did not know where I should be.

862
01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:40.063
There was no home. anymore. to go to.

863
01:14:45.470 --> 01:14:49.323
How many words could it take
to explain these things?

864
01:14:53.010 --> 01:14:55.543
By the time you've read
the ones I've chosen.

865
01:14:56.660 --> 01:15:00.323
I may be dead. or soon will be.

866
01:15:04.610 --> 01:15:07.773
It was never my want to cause you pain.

867
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:14.587
only to know what it means to be free."

868
01:15:21.790 --> 01:15:23.040
- [Paul] Get the marshal!

869
01:15:24.084 --> 01:15:27.180
(crickets chirping)

870
01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:29.593
- No need to strain your voice. Paul.

871
01:15:31.250 --> 01:15:32.343
I've been waiting.

872
01:15:36.430 --> 01:15:37.733
- If we come out now.

873
01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:41.700
do I have your word

874
01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:44.913
that no one will shoot on me or the lady?

875
01:15:46.130 --> 01:15:51.023
- You have my word as
an officer of the peace.

876
01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.460
Put the gun down. Paul.

877
01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:03.078
and there'll be no more
unnecessary violence.

878
01:16:03.078 --> 01:16:06.078
(crickets chirping)

879
01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:11.223
- Only the necessary kind.
ain't that right. Marshal?

880
01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:19.393
- Deputy.

881
01:16:21.050 --> 01:16:25.743
Your wife and her new man. here.

882
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:28.893
have decided to turn themselves in.

883
01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:35.083
- The boy should be given a proper burial.

884
01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:41.130
- Put your gun down and I'll see to it

885
01:16:41.130 --> 01:16:43.353
that he gets what he deserves.

886
01:16:52.326 --> 01:16:53.976
(suspenseful music)

887
01:16:53.976 --> 01:16:56.846
(gunshots popping)

888
01:16:56.846 --> 01:16:58.436
(Graham wails)
(Mabel shrieks)

889
01:16:58.436 --> 01:17:00.346
(gunshots popping)
- Come on!

890
01:17:00.346 --> 01:17:04.179
(suspenseful music continues)

891
01:17:34.176 --> 01:17:36.859
I think the only way is to go around.

892
01:17:36.859 --> 01:17:40.692
(suspenseful music continues)

893
01:17:43.082 --> 01:17:45.582
(Mabel pants)

894
01:17:55.253 --> 01:17:56.503
- Stop.
- Don't!

895
01:17:59.353 --> 01:18:01.313
- You're not gonna stop us.

896
01:18:06.710 --> 01:18:07.543
- Mabel.

897
01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:12.213
You're free.

898
01:18:15.238 --> 01:18:17.946
(gunshot popping)

899
01:18:17.946 --> 01:18:20.446
(Mabel wails)

900
01:18:23.630 --> 01:18:25.840
- I told you he doesn't die!

901
01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:27.483
- I wasn't aiming for him.

902
01:18:28.577 --> 01:18:30.994
(Mabel sobs)

903
01:18:36.559 --> 01:18:38.770
(gunshot popping)

904
01:18:38.770 --> 01:18:40.340
- You've ruined everything.

905
01:18:41.177 --> 01:18:43.594
(Mabel sobs)

906
01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:46.750
He was the only one that knew.

907
01:18:46.750 --> 01:18:48.363
- She knows.

908
01:18:49.410 --> 01:18:53.296
She was there.
(Mabel sobs)

909
01:18:53.296 --> 01:18:54.519
(rifle thudding)

910
01:18:54.519 --> 01:18:57.389
(Mabel sobs)

911
01:18:57.389 --> 01:19:00.389
(crickets chirping)

912
01:19:07.036 --> 01:19:10.960
You thought you got the
best of Lemmy. didn't you?

913
01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:14.320
Always treating me like
you're better than me.

914
01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:15.153
- Coward.

915
01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:22.523
- That'll do.

916
01:19:26.670 --> 01:19:28.503
We have some business to attend to.

917
01:19:31.380 --> 01:19:32.713
- What now. Graham?

918
01:19:33.890 --> 01:19:35.083
He's dead.

919
01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:39.950
- There's no doubt in your mind

920
01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:43.773
that she knows where my stallion is?

921
01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:50.623
- I wouldn't be surprised
if he knows. too.

922
01:19:54.620 --> 01:19:57.323
She probably told him in that letter.

923
01:19:58.950 --> 01:20:01.093
- You read that letter.
- Quiet!

924
01:20:04.910 --> 01:20:09.910
Mabel. I've got some plans
for you. too. darling.

925
01:20:12.124 --> 01:20:14.707
(key clinking)

926
01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:17.480
- This correspondence...

927
01:20:19.470 --> 01:20:20.303
Where is it?

928
01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:30.113
- May I?

929
01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:48.163
What do you think's going to
happen to her when you're gone?

930
01:20:49.774 --> 01:20:52.192
(slap smacking)
(Mabel wails)

931
01:20:52.192 --> 01:20:54.859
(door creaking)

932
01:21:00.210 --> 01:21:03.903
- I told you it was a bad
idea to bring her here.

933
01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:15.710
- I think Mrs. Wade knows. now.

934
01:21:15.710 --> 01:21:17.700
the meaning of discretion.

935
01:21:21.970 --> 01:21:26.970
and there will be much
bloodshed in the time coming up.

936
01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:38.343
We need you. Deputy.

937
01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:43.550
and your estranged wife to live.

938
01:21:50.860 --> 01:21:55.860
so that you can give me back
what is rightfully mine.

939
01:21:56.250 --> 01:21:58.150
- You don't know what's right anymore.

940
01:21:59.291 --> 01:22:00.173
You never did.

941
01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:07.380
- Marshal. I brought some
food for the woman. may I?

942
01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:12.683
- In a short while.

943
01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:16.553
And she may not have a tongue to taste.

944
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:21.863
Smithey?

945
01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:25.480
- [Smithey] Yes. Marshal?

946
01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:29.190
- You are a barber. if
I remember correctly?

947
01:22:29.190 --> 01:22:30.240
- [Smithey] Yes. sir.

948
01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:34.913
- Would you happen to
have your straight razor?

949
01:22:40.322 --> 01:22:42.260
Could I borrow it?

950
01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:46.050
- Marshal. with all due respect.

951
01:22:46.050 --> 01:22:47.893
this ain't what I bargained for.

952
01:22:49.502 --> 01:22:51.880
I'd just soon take my rifle

953
01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:54.080
and leave you all alone
to your own affairs.

954
01:22:55.844 --> 01:22:57.883
- (exhales) Why. of course.

955
01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:03.573
Sheriff?

956
01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:09.383
Can you think of any reason
why he shouldn't take leave?

957
01:23:15.130 --> 01:23:16.033
- Not at all.

958
01:23:18.416 --> 01:23:20.666
Smithey. have a good night.

959
01:23:30.205 --> 01:23:32.823
(crickets chirping)
(gunshot popping)

960
01:23:32.823 --> 01:23:35.823
(suspenseful music)

961
01:23:36.665 --> 01:23:41.665
- Now. I trust that we shall
have no more interruptions.

962
01:23:43.089 --> 01:23:46.922
(suspenseful music continues)

963
01:23:49.109 --> 01:23:52.192
(footsteps clomping)

964
01:23:57.590 --> 01:24:02.590
Sheriff. would you be so kind

965
01:24:03.210 --> 01:24:05.123
as to hold the prisoner's head for me?

966
01:24:08.210 --> 01:24:09.043
- Gladly.

967
01:24:13.135 --> 01:24:15.968
(Jonathan grunts)

968
01:24:19.722 --> 01:24:22.420
(Mabel pants)

969
01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:23.253
- Please!

970
01:24:24.290 --> 01:24:25.453
Stop.

971
01:24:30.670 --> 01:24:32.710
I'll tell you what you want to know.

972
01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:38.440
(dramatic orchestral music continues)

973
01:24:41.998 --> 01:24:44.581
(Graham sighs)

974
01:24:54.530 --> 01:24:55.630
- Where's my stallion?

975
01:24:58.420 --> 01:24:59.253
- Paul...

976
01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:05.603
He set it free.

977
01:25:09.170 --> 01:25:10.453
- Noble gesture.

978
01:25:12.930 --> 01:25:14.863
And a lie.

979
01:25:17.790 --> 01:25:21.793
I've never seen a thief so generous.

980
01:25:31.298 --> 01:25:34.381
(footsteps clomping)

981
01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:46.923
Perhaps you'll tell me the truth.

982
01:25:47.872 --> 01:25:48.705
- Jon.

983
01:25:49.857 --> 01:25:51.783
- You wouldn't recognize the truth.

984
01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:56.133
- Try me.

985
01:26:04.037 --> 01:26:07.204
- "If they prick us. do we not bleed?"

986
01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:11.083
- We have similar tastes.

987
01:26:12.050 --> 01:26:12.883
Shame.

988
01:26:14.290 --> 01:26:16.353
Soon. you won't have any taste.

989
01:26:20.877 --> 01:26:22.856
- [Jonathan] "If they tickle us."

990
01:26:22.856 --> 01:26:24.603
- Mabel. please.

991
01:26:26.897 --> 01:26:28.363
- "Do we not laugh?

992
01:26:33.110 --> 01:26:38.110
If they poison us. do we not die?

993
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:45.566
And if they wrong us."

994
01:26:45.566 --> 01:26:48.395
- "Shall we not revenge?"

995
01:26:48.395 --> 01:26:51.713
(gun cocking)
(dramatic orchestral music)

996
01:26:51.713 --> 01:26:54.546
(gunshot popping)

997
01:27:00.510 --> 01:27:01.582
- Are you all right?

998
01:27:01.582 --> 01:27:02.415
- Yes.

999
01:27:04.090 --> 01:27:05.960
- Oh. I wish I could've done more.

1000
01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:06.793
- Thank you.

1001
01:27:08.850 --> 01:27:10.603
- He may come back again.

1002
01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:14.178
- Mabel. you have to leave now.

1003
01:27:14.178 --> 01:27:16.760
(tense orchestral music)

1004
01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:17.720
- Wake the town.

1005
01:27:22.075 --> 01:27:27.075
(bell tolling)
(tense orchestral music)

1006
01:28:12.175 --> 01:28:13.306
(Smithey grunts)

1007
01:28:13.306 --> 01:28:16.056
(gunshot blasts)

1008
01:28:18.576 --> 01:28:22.826
(tense orchestral music continues)

1009
01:28:29.411 --> 01:28:31.994
(Graham pants)

1010
01:28:34.743 --> 01:28:39.743
- "And Caesar's spirit.
raging with revenge."

1011
01:28:47.125 --> 01:28:49.628
- Do you have someplace you can go?

1012
01:28:49.628 --> 01:28:51.170
(Mabel sighs)

1013
01:28:51.170 --> 01:28:52.003
- The ranch.

1014
01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:54.263
I feel safe there.

1015
01:28:57.250 --> 01:28:58.500
What are you going to do?

1016
01:29:01.010 --> 01:29:02.910
- Make sure Graham doesn't follow you.

1017
01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:07.030
- Jonathan.
- Mabel.

1018
01:29:10.412 --> 01:29:11.523
I meant what I said.

1019
01:29:13.670 --> 01:29:14.503
You're free.

1020
01:29:18.062 --> 01:29:18.895
- Yah!

1021
01:29:21.691 --> 01:29:23.142
Yah.

1022
01:29:23.142 --> 01:29:28.142
(dramatic orchestral music)
(hooves clomping)

1023
01:29:41.823 --> 01:29:45.240
(tense orchestral music)

1024
01:29:46.671 --> 01:29:48.671
- "With Ate by his side.

1025
01:29:51.773 --> 01:29:53.417
come straight from hell."

1026
01:29:55.890 --> 01:30:00.890
- Marshal Graham. you're under arrest.

1027
01:30:03.387 --> 01:30:07.940
- "Shall in these confines
and with a monarch's voice

1028
01:30:07.940 --> 01:30:11.947
cry 'Havoc!' and let
slip the dogs of war!"

1029
01:30:11.947 --> 01:30:14.780
(gunshot popping)

1030
01:30:16.902 --> 01:30:18.763
(Graham coughs)

1031
01:30:18.763 --> 01:30:21.596
(Graham sputters)

1032
01:30:23.079 --> 01:30:26.746
(dramatic orchestral music)

1033
01:30:30.366 --> 01:30:33.533
(footsteps crunching)

1034
01:30:46.771 --> 01:30:47.604
- Deputy.

1035
01:31:07.513 --> 01:31:10.013
(Mabel sighs)

1036
01:31:14.670 --> 01:31:15.523
- Come with me.

1037
01:31:20.332 --> 01:31:23.999
(dramatic orchestral music)
