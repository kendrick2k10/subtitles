True yoga is not about
the shape of your body

4
00:03:08.013 --> 00:03:09.319
but the shape of your life.

5
00:03:14.237 --> 00:03:16.674

These white walls create
such mystical notions.

10
00:03:33.387 --> 00:03:35.737
They are undefinably absolute.

11
00:03:35.824 --> 00:03:38.130
I will take this piece
right here please.

12
00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.394

Barry loves to play.

18
00:03:58.281 --> 00:03:59.282
Cut.

19
00:04:01.066 --> 00:04:03.982

31
00:04:28.093 --> 00:04:29.573
What's the word. Diamond?

32
00:04:29.747 --> 00:04:32.010
Yeah. I'm just super busy
here at the art gallery.

33
00:04:32.097 --> 00:04:33.447
Yeah. you're about
as busy over there

34
00:04:33.621 --> 00:04:34.883
selling overpriced
sheets of white paper

35
00:04:35.144 --> 00:04:37.407
as I am over here
practicing my Oscar speech.

36
00:04:37.494 --> 00:04:39.757
Daddy has given us
his jet and villa.

37
00:04:39.844 --> 00:04:43.979
we take off tomorrow for an
insta trip you won't forget.

38
00:04:44.066 --> 00:04:45.459
What?
No shit.

39
00:04:45.546 --> 00:04:47.156
That sounds amazing.

40
00:04:47.243 --> 00:04:49.158
Which one of your daddy's
houses are we going to?

41
00:04:50.028 --> 00:04:51.203
Phuket...

42
00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:53.205
Thailand!

43
00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:54.772
Are you sure it's safe there?

44
00:04:54.859 --> 00:04:57.079
Decap Ezra.
of course it's safe.

45
00:04:57.166 --> 00:04:58.602
Now go pack your shit.

46
00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:00.343
Wheels up first thing
in the morning.

47
00:05:00.691 --> 00:05:02.867
See y'all on a G tomorrow.
Diamond out.

48
00:05:12.573 --> 00:05:14.314
Welcome. ladies.

49
00:05:14.401 --> 00:05:16.490
Now where the fuck is Ryder?

50
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.319
Oh. of course.

51
00:05:28.415 --> 00:05:29.720
Nice luggage. Ryder.

52
00:05:29.807 --> 00:05:31.069
Fuck off. Daisy.

53
00:05:31.156 --> 00:05:32.244
Oh you would
love to fuck Daisy.

54
00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:33.550
How do you know I haven't?

55
00:05:36.988 --> 00:05:38.686
Wow. welcome. ladies.

56
00:05:38.773 --> 00:05:40.427
I'm Jasper McDaniel.
I'll be your pilot.

57
00:05:40.514 --> 00:05:41.732
We have good weather.

58
00:05:41.993 --> 00:05:43.517
so we should be arriving
in Phuket on time.

59
00:05:43.604 --> 00:05:45.519
Sit back. relax.
enjoy the flight.

60
00:05:45.606 --> 00:05:48.217
and if you guys need
anything. I'll be up front.

61
00:05:48.304 --> 00:05:50.524
Oh my. I can think
of a few things

62
00:05:50.611 --> 00:05:52.308
that our captain can do to me.

63
00:05:52.395 --> 00:05:54.876
Diamond. just let
him focus on his job.

64
00:05:54.963 --> 00:05:56.965
which is literally making
sure we don't crash and die.

65
00:05:57.052 --> 00:05:58.270
Fuck off.

66
00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:00.534
Oh this is fucking awesome!

67
00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:03.537
Enough of the
chitchat. I want a shot.

68
00:06:03.624 --> 00:06:06.409
God. Daisy. the
sun's barely up.

69
00:06:06.496 --> 00:06:08.890
Well I'm sure the sun
is up in Thailand by now.

70
00:06:08.977 --> 00:06:11.980
And I'm just pro-actively
curing future jet lag.

71
00:06:12.067 --> 00:06:13.111
To sex.

72
00:06:13.198 --> 00:06:14.112
To drugs.

73
00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:15.505
To rock and roll.

74
00:06:22.077 --> 00:06:24.209
I think we should all
go around in a circle

75
00:06:24.296 --> 00:06:27.256
and collectively
set an intention

76
00:06:27.343 --> 00:06:29.084
for our vacay together.

77
00:06:29.171 --> 00:06:32.130
Oh my God. Ezra. stop being
so fucking introspective.

78
00:06:32.217 --> 00:06:33.741
Like. just relax.

79
00:06:33.828 --> 00:06:35.786
Here. take a pull.

80
00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.094
I wanna get into some
of that full moon powder

81
00:06:39.181 --> 00:06:41.923
and turn this beach
trip into a ski trip.

82
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.707
Ryder. what about you?

83
00:06:43.794 --> 00:06:46.057
I wanna connect
with my friends.

84
00:06:46.144 --> 00:06:48.538
and have the experience
of a lifetime.

85
00:06:48.625 --> 00:06:50.497
That sounds
pretty fucking lame.

86
00:06:50.584 --> 00:06:55.806
I want to eat great
food. sleep long nights

87
00:06:55.893 --> 00:06:59.244
and fuck anyone I want.

88
00:07:01.595 --> 00:07:02.596
Daddy issues.

89
00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:07.296
My daddy has issues
with you on his plane.

90
00:07:07.383 --> 00:07:08.819
There is the fucking door. Ezra.

91
00:07:10.212 --> 00:07:13.084
Oh my God. chill out [laughs].

92
00:07:13.171 --> 00:07:17.088
Well. I intend to fuck on blow

93
00:07:17.698 --> 00:07:19.917
and have an experience
that we'll never forget.

94
00:07:20.657 --> 00:07:24.139
To motherfucking
Thailand. yeah!

95
00:08:00.044 --> 00:08:01.872
I gotta piss.

96
00:08:01.959 --> 00:08:03.526
Oh enjoy.

97
00:08:03.613 --> 00:08:05.310
I'm gonna go up front
to see if there's

98
00:08:05.397 --> 00:08:07.617
anything I can do
for our captain.

99
00:08:09.837 --> 00:08:11.708
Hey. please don't
fuck with him too much.

100
00:08:11.795 --> 00:08:14.058
I wanna get there in one piece.

101
00:08:22.023 --> 00:08:23.590
Ryder. what the fuck?

102
00:08:23.677 --> 00:08:25.026
I thought we could
use some alone time.

103
00:08:25.113 --> 00:08:26.723
Now is not the time.

104
00:08:27.376 --> 00:08:28.595
If not now. then when?

105
00:08:28.682 --> 00:08:30.597
Look. it's not easy. Ryder.

106
00:08:30.684 --> 00:08:32.729
I mean. life is
complicated for some of us.

107
00:08:32.816 --> 00:08:34.035
For some of us.

108
00:08:34.601 --> 00:08:36.559
What's that supposed to mean?

109
00:08:36.646 --> 00:08:38.343
Look. I am not you.

110
00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:41.390
I'm not all confident wrapped
up in this badassness.

111
00:08:43.348 --> 00:08:48.049
Daisy. you have more
badass in you than you know.

112
00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:50.399
Just go.

113
00:09:00.191 --> 00:09:02.803
This is a club I
thought I'd never join.

114
00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:04.456
The Bang Your
Best Friend Club.

115
00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:06.546
The Mile-High. you
asshole [laughs].

116
00:09:21.169 --> 00:09:22.823
Get some air in here. Dang.

117
00:09:23.824 --> 00:09:24.912
Knock. knock.

118
00:09:24.999 --> 00:09:27.001
Hello. Diamond.
Everything okay?

119
00:09:27.088 --> 00:09:28.742
Everything's great.

120
00:09:28.829 --> 00:09:30.700
Just thought you could
use some company.

121
00:09:31.483 --> 00:09:35.313
Uh. Dang. I'm
stretching my legs.

122
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.619
Controls are off to you.

123
00:09:43.147 --> 00:09:46.150
Wow. you girls really
know how to trash a plane.

124
00:09:46.237 --> 00:09:49.066
Uh. yeah. I've had plenty
of years of experience.

125
00:09:49.153 --> 00:09:50.372
I believe it.

126
00:09:50.459 --> 00:09:52.374
Mm-hm.
So you know my dad?

127
00:09:53.288 --> 00:09:56.334
Not personally. but I
am a fan of his movies.

128
00:09:56.421 --> 00:09:59.337
Oh. I'm sensing a little bit
of mystery to you. Captain.

129
00:09:59.424 --> 00:10:01.165
Mystery? Me?

130
00:10:02.471 --> 00:10:03.777
My life's pretty boring.

131
00:10:03.864 --> 00:10:05.779
I wish I had something to hide.

132
00:10:05.866 --> 00:10:07.563
Married? Kids?

133
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:10.479
Oh no. no. no. no. no.
I'm perpetually single.

134
00:10:10.566 --> 00:10:11.741
Mm.

135
00:10:12.568 --> 00:10:14.875
Well. we might have to do
something to change that.

136
00:10:18.226 --> 00:10:19.444
What about you?

137
00:10:20.402 --> 00:10:21.621
Me?

138
00:10:22.186 --> 00:10:24.711
Oh well. that's gonna take
at least a second date.

139
00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:31.282
Do me a favor.
Grab a seat. okay?

140
00:10:33.981 --> 00:10:35.547
Are we there?

141
00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:36.766
<i>Okay. ladies.</i>

142
00:10:36.853 --> 00:10:37.941
<i>we hit some inclement weather.</i>

143
00:10:38.028 --> 00:10:39.682
It's gonna get a
little bumpy. so

144
00:10:39.769 --> 00:10:41.118
if you could please
buckle your seat belts.

145
00:10:41.205 --> 00:10:42.990
We're gonna crash.
We're all gonna die!

146
00:10:43.077 --> 00:10:44.165
Hey. hey. hey. guys.
we're not gonna die.

147
00:10:44.252 --> 00:10:45.732
It's just a storm.

148
00:10:45.862 --> 00:10:47.603
Yeah. a storm we're right
in the fucking middle of.

149
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.474
We're gonna die!

150
00:10:49.561 --> 00:10:51.389
Ryder. I used your toothbrush.
and I never told you.

151
00:10:51.476 --> 00:10:54.828
And. Daisy. I'm sorry I puked
in the back of your car.

152
00:10:54.915 --> 00:10:59.659
Diamond. I'm so sorry.
but I slept with your dad.

153
00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:03.575
You motherfucker!

154
00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:05.273
Technically. she's
a fatherfucker.

155
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.927
What is the matter with it!

156
00:11:07.014 --> 00:11:11.061

know how much I love you.

well guys. mi casa. su casa.

I mean seriously?

188
00:12:24.352 --> 00:12:27.007
Fuck you. You're sleeping
in the maid's quarters.

189
00:12:27.094 --> 00:12:29.792
Well they always hide the
good booze there anyway.

190
00:12:31.968 --> 00:12:34.144
- Cool.
- Oh my God.

191
00:12:37.191 --> 00:12:38.583

You're gonna see my
pale ass in this pool.

198
00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.052
Your pale ass?

199
00:13:12.139 --> 00:13:14.315
This is the best ever.

200
00:13:14.402 --> 00:13:16.534
This is fucking amazing.

201
00:13:16.621 --> 00:13:18.493
Yeah. right.

202
00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:22.889
Anyone up for heading into
town to get this party started?

203
00:13:22.976 --> 00:13:24.020
Yeah. thought you'd never ask.

204
00:13:24.107 --> 00:13:25.630
Do they have Uber here?

205
00:13:25.892 --> 00:13:28.938

00:14:39.704 --> 00:14:41.750
Forget drinks.
Let's find some blow.

211
00:14:41.837 --> 00:14:44.666
Daisy. you need
to be careful. okay?

212
00:14:44.753 --> 00:14:46.146
You get caught in
Thailand with drugs.

you're gonna be

Brokedown Palace.

This is Thailand.

00:14:51.151 --> 00:14:53.196
Drugs are just as
accessible as rice here.

217
00:14:53.283 --> 00:14:55.198
Just be careful. okay?
Be careful.

218
00:14:55.285 --> 00:14:56.634
That's all I'm saying.

You enjoying your night here?

240
00:16:58.278 --> 00:16:59.931
Oh you could say that.

241
00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:01.281
Well. I was wondering
if you could help me

242
00:17:01.368 --> 00:17:02.804
with a little something.

243
00:17:02.934 --> 00:17:05.589
Anything you need on the
island. we're your girls.

244
00:17:06.416 --> 00:17:07.983
I need some blow.

245
00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:09.680
We never touch
that shit anymore.

246
00:17:11.378 --> 00:17:12.422
Oh fuck off.

247
00:17:25.218 --> 00:17:26.871
Okay. Ezra. that's
our cue to leave.

248
00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:29.352
Hey. fatherfucker.
we're leaving!

249
00:17:29.961 --> 00:17:31.659
You fucked your dad!

250
00:17:31.746 --> 00:17:34.966
No. don't be silly.
I fucked her dad.

251
00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:36.664
- Oh my God.
- Oh.

252
00:17:39.014 --> 00:17:40.233
Do you know where Daisy is?

253
00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.322
Yeah. she went
in this direction.

254
00:17:45.064 --> 00:17:46.456
- Daisy.
- Daisy.

255
00:17:46.543 --> 00:17:47.805
- Daisy?
- Daisy?

256
00:17:48.589 --> 00:17:50.112
- Daisy.
- Daisy.

257
00:17:50.199 --> 00:17:52.506
She's gone. She's not here.

258
00:17:52.593 --> 00:17:53.898
Where the fuck is she?

259
00:17:53.985 --> 00:17:55.770
Maybe she went
back to the villa.

260
00:17:55.857 --> 00:17:58.947
She has no idea where the
villa is. She must be here.

261
00:17:59.034 --> 00:17:59.991
She's searching from coke.

262
00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:01.645
Ezra. shut up.

263
00:18:01.732 --> 00:18:03.517
Guys. let's just find
her and get outta here.

264
00:18:03.604 --> 00:18:04.735
I'm like done.

265
00:18:06.737 --> 00:18:07.869
Daisy?

266
00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:10.611
Hey. have you seen my friend?

267
00:18:10.698 --> 00:18:12.917
Pink shirt. dreads.

268
00:18:13.004 --> 00:18:15.877
We just saw her walk out with
two big Thai motherfuckers.

269
00:18:16.791 --> 00:18:18.706
You ever heard of
having a girl's back?

270
00:18:21.535 --> 00:18:22.623
So basically I'm
just looking for coke.

271
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:24.233
Yeah. not the cheap stuff.

272
00:18:24.538 --> 00:18:26.540
Okay. I need the expensive
stuff for me and my friends.

273
00:18:26.627 --> 00:18:28.063
We're not cheap bitches.

274
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:29.760
- Daisy?
- Daisy.

275
00:18:29.847 --> 00:18:31.066
Hey. we've been looking for you.

276
00:18:31.327 --> 00:18:32.546
I'm just making a
purchase from these

277
00:18:32.633 --> 00:18:34.635
fine gentlemen right here.

278
00:18:34.722 --> 00:18:37.681
That description seems to
be a slight embellishment.

279
00:18:37.768 --> 00:18:40.380
You girls want some party?
Want some company. uh?

280
00:18:40.467 --> 00:18:41.816
No. we don't wanna
fucking party.

281
00:18:41.903 --> 00:18:43.034
and we don't want your company.

282
00:18:43.296 --> 00:18:44.166
Okay. come on.
let's get a move on.

283
00:18:44.384 --> 00:18:45.254
Let's get the fuck outta here.

284
00:18:45.515 --> 00:18:46.777
But it's still
going on inside?

285
00:18:46.864 --> 00:18:48.388
Daisy. okay. time to go.

286
00:18:48.562 --> 00:18:51.347
Why you be so rude?
We just try to help you out.

287
00:18:51.434 --> 00:18:52.653
Oh. fuck you. assholes.

288
00:18:52.827 --> 00:18:54.002
You're coke dealers.
not missionaries.

289
00:18:54.089 --> 00:18:55.438
Let's go.

290
00:18:55.699 --> 00:18:58.702
Well. Well. we aren't
coke dealers neither.

291
00:18:58.789 --> 00:19:00.487
Now you rich bitches
are gonna give us

292
00:19:00.574 --> 00:19:01.923
all your fucking money.

293
00:19:02.184 --> 00:19:04.752
Look. sirs. you can.
you can have our money.

294
00:19:04.839 --> 00:19:06.536
Okay. but then just
please don't hurt us.

295
00:19:06.623 --> 00:19:08.059
Please don't hurt us.

296
00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:10.192
You guys wanna play?
Let's fucking play.

297
00:19:12.063 --> 00:19:13.413
What's going on here?

298
00:19:13.674 --> 00:19:15.154
Jasper?

299
00:19:15.328 --> 00:19:17.808
Get the fuck out of here!
This ain't your problem.

300
00:19:17.895 --> 00:19:18.983
Oh. I think it is.

301
00:19:19.245 --> 00:19:20.637
Hey. [speaks
foreign language].

302
00:19:20.724 --> 00:19:22.073
We don't want
anyone to get hurt.

303
00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:23.205
Okay.

304
00:19:23.292 --> 00:19:25.468
Remember. you asked for this.

305
00:19:25.555 --> 00:19:27.949
Pressing your nose
where it doesn't belong.

306
00:19:32.214 --> 00:19:33.650
Please. don't shoot. okay.

307
00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:36.392
How did you do that?

308
00:19:38.264 --> 00:19:40.527
I guess I watched too many
of your father's movies.

309
00:19:40.614 --> 00:19:43.791
Well. you know.
we had this covered.

310
00:19:43.878 --> 00:19:45.096
Thank you.

311
00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:46.750
Thank you so much.

312
00:19:46.968 --> 00:19:48.361
Look. girls. I know you can
take care of yourselves

313
00:19:48.448 --> 00:19:50.537
but this island
can get dangerous.

314
00:19:50.624 --> 00:19:52.930
especially if you girls
are looking for trouble.

315
00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:55.759
You got something
I can write on?

316
00:19:55.846 --> 00:19:57.457
- Here.
- Okay.

317
00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:03.202
If you need anything.
that's where I'll be.

318
00:20:03.289 --> 00:20:06.640
Pen and paper? This guy is
so old school fucking cool.

319
00:20:06.727 --> 00:20:08.990
- Let's go.
- Okay. thank you.

320
00:20:09.077 --> 00:20:10.383
Oh my God.

321
00:20:10.818 --> 00:20:12.341
Who are you. Jasper?

322
00:20:13.995 --> 00:20:17.433
I'm just a lonely pilot
trying to enjoy his layover.

323
00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.305
Yeah. well you know.
I watched too many

324
00:20:19.392 --> 00:20:20.784
of my dad's films as well.

325
00:20:21.089 --> 00:20:24.310
and I tend to have a
pretty good read on people.

326
00:20:24.397 --> 00:20:26.616
A simple thank you will do.

327
00:20:26.703 --> 00:20:30.664
Jasper. I don't believe
you. But thank you.

328
00:20:38.933 --> 00:20:40.674
The bags arrived.

329
00:20:40.761 --> 00:20:42.545
Finally. I can get
out of these clothes.

330
00:20:42.632 --> 00:20:44.286
Why. did you like
shit your pants

331
00:20:44.373 --> 00:20:45.548
when your coke deal went south?

332
00:20:45.635 --> 00:20:47.289
Diamond. lay off her.

333
00:20:47.376 --> 00:20:50.684
I am so tired.
Anyone else wanna swim?

334
00:20:50.771 --> 00:20:52.207
Good idea.

335
00:20:52.381 --> 00:20:53.861
Bring the bags to the
room. put on our suits

336
00:20:53.948 --> 00:20:55.428
and meet you back in five.

337
00:20:55.515 --> 00:20:57.908
Uh uh. uh uh uh. I
wasn't fucking kidding.

338
00:20:57.995 --> 00:20:59.345
You're over there.

339
00:21:02.478 --> 00:21:04.480
Fuck
someone's dad once.

340
00:21:04.567 --> 00:21:07.701
it's like you're
a fucking pariah.

341
00:21:14.577 --> 00:21:16.797
Everybody
get out here!

342
00:21:16.884 --> 00:21:18.451
What the fuck?

343
00:21:20.757 --> 00:21:23.194
Don't even freak out
if you forgot a swimsuit.

344
00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:25.762
I have like 20. okay?

345
00:21:25.849 --> 00:21:29.549
No bikini. no
clothes. no nothing.

346
00:21:31.507 --> 00:21:32.421
Holy shit.

347
00:21:32.508 --> 00:21:33.770
Is that real?

348
00:21:33.857 --> 00:21:35.946
- I know one way to find out.
- Hey.

349
00:21:37.034 --> 00:21:39.080
This bag looks just like mine.

350
00:21:39.167 --> 00:21:40.560
This is nuts. right?

351
00:21:41.517 --> 00:21:43.171
We have to call Jasper.

352
00:21:43.258 --> 00:21:44.651
No. uh-uh.

353
00:21:44.825 --> 00:21:47.523
I'm not quite sure that's
our best move right now.

354
00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:49.699
Our best move?
He just saved our lives.

355
00:21:49.786 --> 00:21:51.484
There is something
off about him.

356
00:21:51.571 --> 00:21:55.183
For all we know. he's got
something to do with this.

357
00:21:56.097 --> 00:21:57.838
You're being
paranoid. Diamond.

358
00:21:57.925 --> 00:21:58.839
Oh. really?

359
00:21:58.926 --> 00:22:00.536
New pilot. first flight.

360
00:22:00.623 --> 00:22:03.017
we know absolutely
nothing about him.

361
00:22:03.104 --> 00:22:05.672
Shows up out of nowhere at the
club when we're in trouble.

362
00:22:05.759 --> 00:22:06.934
I mean. he may have
been following us. guys.

363
00:22:07.021 --> 00:22:08.109
I'm just saying.

364
00:22:08.196 --> 00:22:10.067
You know what?
I say we do one.

365
00:22:10.372 --> 00:22:11.678
We'll have a night.
Call the cops in the morning
to pick it up.

366
00:22:11.765 --> 00:22:14.115
and we just sort
this shit out then.

367
00:22:14.202 --> 00:22:15.943
Just one?[Daisy] Yeah.

368
00:22:16.552 --> 00:22:18.032
Just one.

369
00:22:18.902 --> 00:22:21.731
No. guys. that
is not a good idea.

370
00:22:21.818 --> 00:22:23.298
Just one.

371
00:22:31.698 --> 00:22:33.003
Okay. just one.

372
00:22:33.656 --> 00:22:34.657
Fuck it.

373
00:22:36.398 --> 00:22:38.139
Okay. start it up.

374
00:22:38.226 --> 00:22:40.184
I'm gonna put this
somewhere safe

375
00:22:40.271 --> 00:22:44.450
so Miss Vacuum over there
doesn't get any ideas.

376
00:22:46.321 --> 00:22:48.454

Oh.

393
00:24:04.617 --> 00:24:06.575
Morning. fuckers.

394
00:24:07.663 --> 00:24:09.230
Morning.

395
00:24:10.013 --> 00:24:12.363
I literally feel like
a truck rode over me.

396
00:24:12.451 --> 00:24:13.974
Oh. that can be arranged.

397
00:24:14.148 --> 00:24:16.716
Come on. Diamond. you ever
gonna cut her some slack?

398
00:24:16.803 --> 00:24:18.108
You know it could've been worse.

399
00:24:18.195 --> 00:24:20.328
Yeah? How so?

400
00:24:20.415 --> 00:24:23.505
Well. your dad could have
fallen in love with her.

401
00:24:23.592 --> 00:24:26.552
married her and made
her your evil stepmommy.

402
00:24:26.639 --> 00:24:28.467
And then this
would be my house.

403
00:24:28.554 --> 00:24:30.556
Oh my God. you wish.

404
00:24:31.992 --> 00:24:36.039
Anyway. where's our little
bloodhound?

405
00:24:36.126 --> 00:24:37.824
Did she ever get to bed?

406
00:24:37.911 --> 00:24:39.608
I don't know.
I crashed first.

407
00:24:41.175 --> 00:24:42.132
Mm.

408
00:24:42.219 --> 00:24:43.612
Should we go wake her up?

409
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:46.572
What is the rush. okay?
Just let her sleep.

410
00:24:46.659 --> 00:24:47.877
God.

411
00:24:48.269 --> 00:24:50.358
We have a big day planned.[Ezra] No.

412
00:24:50.445 --> 00:24:52.752
Daisy. we're coming for ya!

413
00:24:52.839 --> 00:24:54.493
Yes!

414
00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:55.711
Come on.

415
00:24:55.798 --> 00:24:58.409
Oh my. you bitch!

416
00:25:10.073 --> 00:25:11.901
Holy fuck!

417
00:25:11.988 --> 00:25:14.164
Oh my God. Oh my God.
what are we gonna do?

418
00:25:14.251 --> 00:25:16.384
What are we gonna do?
What is happening?
What is happening?

419
00:25:16.471 --> 00:25:17.516
I told you we shouldn't
have touched the bag.

420
00:25:17.603 --> 00:25:18.560
Fuck! Fuck!

421
00:25:18.647 --> 00:25:19.909
We have to do something.

422
00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:21.694
Diamond. Diamond.
we have to call the cops.

423
00:25:21.781 --> 00:25:22.869
We have to call
the cops. Diamond.

424
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:25.088
Jasper. we need
- to call Jasper.
- We need to call your father.

425
00:25:25.175 --> 00:25:26.437
Your father would
know what to do.

426
00:25:26.742 --> 00:25:28.265
Your dad would definitely
- know what to do.
- Shh.

427
00:25:29.919 --> 00:25:32.792
If we call the cops.
she's dead.

428
00:25:33.357 --> 00:25:36.491
If we call my father.
she's dead.

429
00:25:36.578 --> 00:25:39.581
If we call anyone. she's dead.

430
00:25:40.451 --> 00:25:41.844
We need to handle this.

431
00:25:44.499 --> 00:25:45.848
- Diamond.
- We need to handle this.

432
00:25:45.935 --> 00:25:47.154
Diamond.

433
00:25:47.241 --> 00:25:48.721
How are we gonna handle this?

434
00:25:48.808 --> 00:25:50.679
I can't even handle it.

435
00:26:26.672 --> 00:26:28.848
Diamond. this isn't one of
your dad's fucking movies.

436
00:26:28.935 --> 00:26:30.676
This is real life.

437
00:26:30.763 --> 00:26:32.895
- Get serious.
- I am serious.

438
00:26:32.982 --> 00:26:35.637
If what I say isn't
exactly what happens.

439
00:26:35.724 --> 00:26:37.030
then go ahead. call the cops.

440
00:26:37.117 --> 00:26:38.684
What are you talking about?

441
00:26:38.771 --> 00:26:40.990
We're going to get
a call any minute.

442
00:26:41.077 --> 00:26:43.297
Ezra. you're gonna
answer the phone.

443
00:26:43.384 --> 00:26:45.516
Read exactly what I wrote.

444
00:26:45.604 --> 00:26:47.736
And then just. just hang up.

445
00:26:48.781 --> 00:26:50.434
This is not a fucking film.

446
00:26:56.049 --> 00:26:57.354
Answer it.

447
00:26:59.661 --> 00:27:00.706
Answer it.

448
00:27:10.716 --> 00:27:12.195
We have what you want.

449
00:27:14.502 --> 00:27:19.638
But. we also have a very
particular set of skills.

450
00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:24.251
Skills that we've acquired
over the years of our careers.

451
00:27:26.296 --> 00:27:29.517
Skills that make us a
nightmare for people like you.

452
00:27:31.171 --> 00:27:34.522
If you let our friend go now.
that'll be the end of it.

453
00:27:35.044 --> 00:27:36.611
We will not pursue you.

454
00:27:37.568 --> 00:27:39.005
But if you don't.

455
00:27:39.919 --> 00:27:41.485
we will look for you.

456
00:27:42.399 --> 00:27:43.749
We will find you.

457
00:27:44.706 --> 00:27:46.882
And we will kill you.

458
00:27:51.495 --> 00:27:54.368
That was fucking
awesome [laughs]!

459
00:27:55.543 --> 00:27:57.066
You guys believe me now?

460
00:27:57.153 --> 00:27:58.459
Diamond. what have we
gotten ourselves into?

461
00:27:58.546 --> 00:28:00.330
I know. but fuck this.

462
00:28:01.505 --> 00:28:02.855
We're gonna go save Daisy.

463
00:28:06.554 --> 00:28:07.729
Okay.

464
00:28:09.296 --> 00:28:12.429
Okay. let's just break
down what happened.

465
00:28:12.516 --> 00:28:15.606
When the plane landed. somehow
Ryder's bag got mixed up

466
00:28:15.694 --> 00:28:17.608
with some kind of drug shipment.

467
00:28:18.958 --> 00:28:20.307
Whew.

468
00:28:20.394 --> 00:28:22.135
Now. who could have done this?

469
00:28:22.222 --> 00:28:24.790
There were only two other
people than us on the plane.

470
00:28:26.661 --> 00:28:28.576
But Jasper saved us.

471
00:28:28.663 --> 00:28:30.621
No. for all we know.
he was following us

472
00:28:30.709 --> 00:28:32.667
to find the missing bag.

473
00:28:32.754 --> 00:28:36.366
We can't trust him.
We can't trust anyone.

474
00:28:39.108 --> 00:28:42.721
Okay. they come in last night
looking for their product.

475
00:28:42.808 --> 00:28:45.506
They couldn't find it. so
they take collateral. Daisy.

476
00:28:48.074 --> 00:28:49.815
This is seriously nuts.

477
00:28:49.902 --> 00:28:51.599
We have what they want.

478
00:28:51.686 --> 00:28:53.644
Well. they have what we want.

479
00:28:53.732 --> 00:28:55.255
Who is they?

480
00:28:55.342 --> 00:28:56.952
It's a golden triangle.

481
00:28:57.692 --> 00:28:59.607
What is a golden triangle?

482
00:28:59.694 --> 00:29:01.565
It's the area where
the borders of Laos.

483
00:29:01.652 --> 00:29:03.654
Myanmar and Thailand meet.

484
00:29:03.742 --> 00:29:06.048
One of the world's busiest
drug trafficking regions.

485
00:29:06.135 --> 00:29:09.530
and. guys. we've just
fucked with the balance

486
00:29:09.617 --> 00:29:11.488
of the Thai's drug cartel.

487
00:29:11.575 --> 00:29:13.577
Oh shit! Oh fuck.

488
00:29:13.664 --> 00:29:14.970
Oh my God.

489
00:29:16.406 --> 00:29:18.539
So what's our next move?

490
00:29:18.626 --> 00:29:20.541
They will contact us
and deliver instructions

491
00:29:20.628 --> 00:29:22.586
for the drop and
trade for Daisy.

492
00:29:22.673 --> 00:29:25.720
Likely somewhere in town
with lots of people around.

493
00:29:26.765 --> 00:29:29.289
Diamond. this is all just
like a little bit too much.

494
00:29:29.376 --> 00:29:31.552
but I don't think that growing
up on your dad's movie sets

495
00:29:31.639 --> 00:29:34.729
makes you exactly qualified
or me exactly qualified

496
00:29:34.816 --> 00:29:38.037
to. you know. do a
hostage rescue situation.

497
00:29:38.124 --> 00:29:39.995
Yeah. I'm with her.

498
00:29:40.082 --> 00:29:41.736
You have to believe me.

499
00:29:41.823 --> 00:29:44.391
I know we all love Daisy
and we need her back safe.

500
00:29:44.478 --> 00:29:45.740
but at this point.

501
00:29:48.134 --> 00:29:49.744
the only ones that
are going to be able

502
00:29:49.831 --> 00:29:52.312
to do this are the three of us.

503
00:29:55.924 --> 00:29:56.925
I do have one
question. though.

504
00:29:57.012 --> 00:29:58.274
Yeah. so do I.

505
00:29:58.492 --> 00:30:00.363
- Where's the blow?
- Where's the cocaine?

506
00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:03.062
Follow me.

507
00:30:14.029 --> 00:30:15.857
What is this?

508
00:30:15.944 --> 00:30:17.467
Panic room.

509
00:30:17.728 --> 00:30:19.730
Okay. so you tell us now
that you have a panic room?

510
00:30:20.688 --> 00:30:22.733
Because this is like
a totally normal thing

511
00:30:22.821 --> 00:30:24.823
that one has in
the house. right?

512
00:30:27.608 --> 00:30:28.565
What up?

513
00:30:28.652 --> 00:30:30.480
This is fucking awesome.

514
00:30:30.567 --> 00:30:32.831
That's a lot of guns.

515
00:30:33.396 --> 00:30:34.789
What is that?

516
00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:37.705
Oh. that's a Replicator.
It's a 3-D printer.

517
00:30:37.792 --> 00:30:40.360
This is fucking badass!

518
00:30:40.969 --> 00:30:42.579
Okay. why does Daddy...

519
00:30:44.625 --> 00:30:46.496
What does your daddy
have one of these?

520
00:30:46.583 --> 00:30:50.109
Uh. because he's rich and
famous and his life has value.

521
00:30:50.196 --> 00:30:52.198
He builds these panic
rooms for us everywhere.

522
00:30:52.285 --> 00:30:53.939
Like. gives him peace of mind.

523
00:30:55.244 --> 00:30:57.333
And here it is.

524
00:30:57.812 --> 00:30:59.770
No one knows about this room.

525
00:30:59.858 --> 00:31:02.208
There is no way of
finding it. tracking it.

526
00:31:02.295 --> 00:31:03.687
It's basically invisible.

527
00:31:05.733 --> 00:31:06.777
Diamond. what are we gonna do?

528
00:31:08.127 --> 00:31:10.694
We're going to town and act
as if nothing has happened.

529
00:31:10.781 --> 00:31:12.392
We don't alert anyone.

530
00:31:12.479 --> 00:31:13.872
They will find us and
deliver instructions

531
00:31:13.959 --> 00:31:15.438
for the drop and
trade for Daisy.

532
00:31:15.525 --> 00:31:17.701
Okay. and then what next?

533
00:31:17.788 --> 00:31:21.227
Then the shit. all gets real.

534
00:31:23.446 --> 00:31:25.971
Who fucking has one of these?

535
00:31:26.058 --> 00:31:27.668
I bail.

536
00:31:38.635 --> 00:31:39.767
There's so many people.

537
00:31:39.854 --> 00:31:41.856
Are you sure this
was a good idea?

538
00:31:41.943 --> 00:31:43.553
Three beers please.

539
00:31:43.814 --> 00:31:46.165
Okay. I'm with Ezra. How are
we gonna do this on our own?

540
00:31:46.252 --> 00:31:47.906
By staying calm.

541
00:31:47.993 --> 00:31:49.603
I'm so stressed out.

542
00:31:49.733 --> 00:31:52.867
Look. if it was just one of us.
we would be in deep shit.

543
00:31:52.954 --> 00:31:56.088
If it was just two of us.
we would be totally fucked.

544
00:31:56.175 --> 00:31:58.046
But the three of us together.

545
00:31:58.133 --> 00:32:01.093
we make up one pretty
fucking lethal weapon.

546
00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:02.703
How do you figure?

547
00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:06.925
We have the brains.
the body and the bimbo.

548
00:32:07.621 --> 00:32:09.318
Go on. yeah.

549
00:32:09.405 --> 00:32:12.191
I have lived every
one of my dad's films.

550
00:32:12.278 --> 00:32:15.498
I know these guys. what
they think. how they plan.

551
00:32:15.585 --> 00:32:17.631
I know their moves
before they do.

552
00:32:17.718 --> 00:32:19.328
I'm the brains.

553
00:32:20.286 --> 00:32:21.809
Ryder. you are the body.

554
00:32:21.896 --> 00:32:23.637
Your years of avoiding
anything in life that

555
00:32:23.724 --> 00:32:26.509
is actually fun and
focusing all your energy

556
00:32:26.596 --> 00:32:28.163
on those extreme sporty things

557
00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:30.339
gives you a leg up
on these cocksuckers.

558
00:32:30.426 --> 00:32:33.473
When we need some
physical action. it's you.

559
00:32:34.822 --> 00:32:36.563
Oh. so that
makes me the bimbo.

560
00:32:38.521 --> 00:32:40.480
And what exactly do
you mean by that?

561
00:32:40.567 --> 00:32:42.308
It means. you're an actor.

562
00:32:42.395 --> 00:32:44.832
You're our voice.

563
00:32:44.919 --> 00:32:47.574
The words we say need to
come convincingly from you.

564
00:32:49.619 --> 00:32:53.275
Yeah. I can do that but I'm
really fucking stressed out.

565
00:32:53.362 --> 00:32:54.581
I'm literally panicking.

566
00:32:55.712 --> 00:32:57.105
Chill.

567
00:33:03.764 --> 00:33:04.678
What did he say?

568
00:33:04.765 --> 00:33:06.201
Fuck do I know?

569
00:33:10.379 --> 00:33:13.992
The boy is saying the
daisies are in full bloom.

570
00:33:14.079 --> 00:33:15.515
No they're not.
They're like wilted.

571
00:33:15.602 --> 00:33:17.865
Buy the flowers.
Buy them now. buy them.

572
00:33:17.952 --> 00:33:19.301
Oh shit.

573
00:33:19.388 --> 00:33:20.520
Uh.

574
00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:23.740
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

575
00:33:28.876 --> 00:33:30.399
What do we do?

576
00:33:30.486 --> 00:33:31.574
Open it.

577
00:33:31.661 --> 00:33:32.706
Carefully.

578
00:33:32.793 --> 00:33:33.924
Me?

579
00:33:34.534 --> 00:33:35.578
I don't want to.

580
00:33:36.666 --> 00:33:37.711
Could be a bomb.

581
00:33:37.798 --> 00:33:39.669
- Shut up.
- Just do it.

582
00:33:43.412 --> 00:33:44.674
What is it?

583
00:33:44.761 --> 00:33:46.502
Oh. shit.

584
00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:48.852
Come over.

585
00:33:52.987 --> 00:33:55.685
- Turn it on.
- No. no. No.

586
00:33:56.686 --> 00:33:58.601
Turn it on carefully.

587
00:34:13.181 --> 00:34:15.314
This here is a banana spider.

588
00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:20.014
It is the most venomous
spider in the world.

589
00:34:20.667 --> 00:34:22.625
There is no antivenom.

590
00:34:22.712 --> 00:34:25.019
So I suggest that
you don't move.

591
00:34:30.155 --> 00:34:31.895
Shh. shh. shh. shh.

592
00:34:34.115 --> 00:34:35.856
<i>Come on. baby.</i>

593
00:34:35.943 --> 00:34:36.987
<i>There we go.</i>

594
00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:48.564
Okay. Listen to me carefully.

595
00:34:49.652 --> 00:34:52.916
<i>Go to the Fountain
Circle at Old Geptown.</i>

596
00:34:53.003 --> 00:34:56.572
<i>There you will see
a big banyan tree.</i>

597
00:34:56.659 --> 00:34:59.923
<i>Be on the bench next
to it tomorrow at noon.</i>

598
00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:03.362
Bring the product. and
I'll bring your friend.

599
00:35:11.935 --> 00:35:14.112
Oh my God. Oh my God.

600
00:35:14.199 --> 00:35:15.678
This is so fucked up.

601
00:35:17.332 --> 00:35:20.596
If anything happens to Daisy.
if anything happens--

602
00:35:20.683 --> 00:35:22.076
She will be fine.

603
00:35:22.946 --> 00:35:23.947
Okay.

604
00:35:24.034 --> 00:35:26.559
She is really strong.

605
00:35:26.646 --> 00:35:29.083
Okay. we're just gonna
follow their instructions and...

606
00:35:30.171 --> 00:35:32.130
by this time tomorrow
Daisy will be back with us

607
00:35:32.217 --> 00:35:35.350
and we can get
the fuck out of here.

608
00:35:38.701 --> 00:35:40.050
She's right.

609
00:35:40.747 --> 00:35:43.228
Let's just get back to the
villa and plan for tomorrow.

610
00:35:43.315 --> 00:35:44.794
Oh my God. Ezra.

611
00:35:44.881 --> 00:35:46.753
I am sorry.
You need to be clear of mind.

612
00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:48.102
Come on.

613
00:36:05.032 --> 00:36:07.121
We need to get
ready for tomorrow.

614
00:36:07.208 --> 00:36:08.688
Always be prepared
for the worst.

615
00:36:09.776 --> 00:36:10.864
Yeah. and what's that?

616
00:36:11.734 --> 00:36:13.780
These guys don't
give a shit about us.

617
00:36:13.867 --> 00:36:15.912
As soon as they get
their stuff back.

618
00:36:15.999 --> 00:36:18.219
we no longer have
any value to them.

619
00:36:18.306 --> 00:36:20.047
We can't trust
anything they say.

620
00:36:20.134 --> 00:36:21.962
They will try to cheat us.

621
00:36:23.703 --> 00:36:25.226
And then what?

622
00:36:25.313 --> 00:36:26.619
Plan B.

623
00:36:26.706 --> 00:36:28.577
What's Plan B?

624
00:36:28.664 --> 00:36:31.232
That is a very good
question I don't have

625
00:36:31.319 --> 00:36:33.060
the answer to right now.

626
00:36:33.147 --> 00:36:36.585
Anyway. tomorrow. Ryder.
you will do the drop.

627
00:36:36.672 --> 00:36:39.022
Ezra and I will find vantage
points where we can see

628
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:41.068
everything that's going on.

629
00:36:41.155 --> 00:36:42.591
We'll be your eyes and ears.

630
00:36:43.723 --> 00:36:44.941
Eyes and ears.

631
00:36:47.509 --> 00:36:48.554
So what next?

632
00:36:49.772 --> 00:36:50.947
Target practice.

633
00:36:52.079 --> 00:36:54.168
Are you fucking kidding me?

634
00:36:54.255 --> 00:36:55.691
Okay. ladies. now.

635
00:36:55.778 --> 00:36:58.390
the most important thing
when you're firing a gun

636
00:36:58.477 --> 00:37:00.783
is your breath.

637
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:02.698
Control your breathing
to keep yourself steady.

638
00:37:04.657 --> 00:37:07.790
Take aim through here and
slowly pull the trigger.

639
00:37:09.749 --> 00:37:12.099
You need to be gentle.

640
00:37:12.186 --> 00:37:15.189
Slow. It's the foreplay
before the fuck.

641
00:37:20.194 --> 00:37:21.717
Why doesn't that surprise me?

642
00:37:21.804 --> 00:37:24.154
Years of working on
that bullshit cop show.

643
00:37:24.242 --> 00:37:25.895
and still nothing
to show for it.

644
00:37:25.982 --> 00:37:28.724
Okay. let me make
this easy for you.

645
00:37:28.811 --> 00:37:30.726
Hold the rifle steadily.

646
00:37:30.813 --> 00:37:33.860
Put the butt firmly into
the pocket of your shoulder.

647
00:37:33.947 --> 00:37:35.644
Relax your body.

648
00:37:35.731 --> 00:37:38.386
Aim that little dot where
you want the bullet to go.

649
00:37:38.473 --> 00:37:39.605
And fire.

650
00:37:43.783 --> 00:37:45.045
Okay.

651
00:37:45.654 --> 00:37:47.961
Are you positive that we should
be handling these things?

652
00:37:48.048 --> 00:37:49.963
Like what. what makes
you such an expert

653
00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:52.879
on this. Diamond. like
playing with your dad's toys?

654
00:37:52.966 --> 00:37:54.402
Dad's toys?

655
00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:03.759
Yeah. I suppose so.
Get some sleep. ladies.

656
00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:14.640
Do you think it's
gonna be hot on the roof?

657
00:38:17.425 --> 00:38:18.731
It's showtime.

658
00:38:18.818 --> 00:38:20.559
Yeah. but can we please.
like. be careful?

659
00:38:20.646 --> 00:38:22.952
Yeah. sure.
Whatever. Mom.

660
00:38:23.039 --> 00:38:24.345
What's in the bag?

661
00:38:25.868 --> 00:38:27.392
More toys.

662
00:38:27.479 --> 00:38:28.828
You ready?

663
00:38:28.915 --> 00:38:30.220
Let's go.

664
00:38:31.831 --> 00:38:34.007
She's fucking crazy.

665
00:38:59.641 --> 00:39:02.775
Come to Thailand.
it'll be sick.

666
00:39:02.862 --> 00:39:04.385
It'll be a blast.

667
00:39:04.472 --> 00:39:06.692
Oh Ryder. you're
doing just fine.

668
00:39:06.779 --> 00:39:08.215
<i>Just take a seat on the bench.</i>

669
00:39:15.396 --> 00:39:17.398
<i>You look great. by the way.</i>

670
00:39:29.236 --> 00:39:31.064
Shit. there's a phone here.

671
00:39:32.021 --> 00:39:33.240
What do I do?

672
00:39:33.327 --> 00:39:34.372
Answer it.

673
00:39:34.459 --> 00:39:36.591
<i>Don't speak. just listen.</i>

674
00:39:41.901 --> 00:39:43.076
<i>There's a black van that's</i>

675
00:39:43.163 --> 00:39:45.383
pulling into the
square right now.

676
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:46.688
<i>Look to your left.</i>

677
00:39:52.607 --> 00:39:55.784
<i>Also. there's a trash
bin beyond the tree.</i>

678
00:39:57.264 --> 00:39:58.918
<i>Drop the duffel
bag into the bin.</i>

679
00:39:59.484 --> 00:40:00.833
and we'll let your friend go.

680
00:40:05.359 --> 00:40:06.665
Something does not feel right.

681
00:40:06.926 --> 00:40:08.623
Ryder. just put the
drugs in the trash bin

682
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:09.798
<i>and let's get Daisy home.</i>

683
00:40:25.988 --> 00:40:27.381
Fuck. fuck. fuck.

684
00:40:37.304 --> 00:40:38.871
It's not her!

685
00:40:38.958 --> 00:40:40.307
Shit. run!

686
00:40:45.268 --> 00:40:46.313
Okay. let's go.

687
00:41:20.129 --> 00:41:21.609
Stop. stop. stop!

688
00:42:19.493 --> 00:42:21.669
Ah! Fuckers!

689
00:42:21.756 --> 00:42:23.236
We are in way over our heads.

690
00:42:23.323 --> 00:42:25.238
and we need to
call the cops now!

691
00:42:25.325 --> 00:42:26.718
No cops. Ezra.

692
00:42:26.805 --> 00:42:28.154
Diamond's right.

693
00:42:28.415 --> 00:42:30.156
These assholes fucked
with the wrong girls.

694
00:42:30.243 --> 00:42:31.853
Payback's gonna be a bitch.

695
00:42:31.984 --> 00:42:34.552
Okay. tough guy. one problem.
We have no leverage.

696
00:42:34.639 --> 00:42:37.337
They have Daisy and now
they also have the cocaine.

697
00:42:37.424 --> 00:42:38.991
Fuck. she's right.

698
00:42:42.603 --> 00:42:43.691
We're fucking screwed.

699
00:42:46.564 --> 00:42:47.869
Holy shit.

700
00:42:47.956 --> 00:42:49.741
Holy shit.

701
00:42:49.871 --> 00:42:52.961
Yeah. they were never going
to just hand Daisy back to us.

702
00:42:53.048 --> 00:42:54.963
This was always the first
step in getting her back.

703
00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:57.226
That's how I knew it
wasn't Daisy today.

704
00:42:57.313 --> 00:43:00.186
Bold move D-dog.
you gonna tell us or?

705
00:43:00.273 --> 00:43:02.188
I needed you guys
to be convincing.

706
00:43:02.275 --> 00:43:03.537
Okay. I just. I need a break.

707
00:43:03.624 --> 00:43:05.234
I am so stressed out right now.

708
00:43:06.584 --> 00:43:09.151
Wait. if the coke
was here. then--

709
00:43:09.238 --> 00:43:10.979
What was in the
bag I gave them?

710
00:43:11.153 --> 00:43:13.591
Oh. it was just filled with
Ezra's panties. bras and all.

711
00:43:15.201 --> 00:43:16.637
Okay. so are we even now?

712
00:43:16.724 --> 00:43:19.118
Not even.
But we're getting there.

713
00:43:19.684 --> 00:43:22.469
All right. what's next?
Plan B.

714
00:43:24.993 --> 00:43:26.647
What are you thinking?

715
00:43:27.039 --> 00:43:30.259
<i>Of the Thai drug cartel. an
avid supporter of Muay Thai</i>

716
00:43:30.346 --> 00:43:33.393
<i>Koon has been rumored to be
training his prizefighter</i>

717
00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:37.527
<i>known as Goliath in a
completely unconventional way.</i>

718
00:43:37.615 --> 00:43:39.878
Pause it. Pause it.
pause it. pause it.

719
00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:43.098
What are you thinking?

720
00:43:44.665 --> 00:43:46.319
Tomorrow at the fight club.

721
00:43:46.406 --> 00:43:48.843
we're gonna kidnap the head
of Thai's drug cartel.

722
00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:50.105
and trade him for Daisy.

723
00:43:50.192 --> 00:43:52.455
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck?

724
00:43:52.542 --> 00:43:54.544
You've lost your mind.
You've lost your mind.

725
00:43:54.632 --> 00:43:56.416
No. I'm down.

726
00:43:56.503 --> 00:43:58.287
I'll do whatever it
takes to get Daisy back.

727
00:43:58.374 --> 00:44:00.899
Good to know.
We've gotta start stretching.

728
00:44:00.986 --> 00:44:02.988
Fine. what's the plan?

729
00:44:03.075 --> 00:44:05.773
Ezra. are you still
shooting up that teen tox?

730
00:44:07.122 --> 00:44:08.210
What?

731
00:44:10.604 --> 00:44:11.518
Now and then.

732
00:44:11.605 --> 00:44:12.780
Oh.

733
00:44:14.477 --> 00:44:16.131
Go grab your syringes.

734
00:44:16.436 --> 00:44:19.657
Then go to Daisy's room and
take all of her sleeping pills.

735
00:44:19.744 --> 00:44:22.311
Ryder. you know how to
work that 3-D printer?

736
00:44:22.398 --> 00:44:24.052
Fuck yeah.

737
00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:27.447
Okay. it's time to kiss my
Balmain latex one-piece goodbye.

738
00:44:27.534 --> 00:44:29.014
Why?

739
00:44:29.101 --> 00:44:30.363
Trust me.

740
00:44:30.624 --> 00:44:32.017
Okay. let's go.

741
00:44:32.104 --> 00:44:33.366
Okay.

742
00:45:03.701 --> 00:45:07.617
<i>In our path. he will
be the next undis--</i>

743
00:45:37.604 --> 00:45:38.779
I really hope
you don't expect us

744
00:45:38.866 --> 00:45:39.911
to go out with you tonight.

745
00:45:39.998 --> 00:45:42.130
No. I don't want us to go out.

746
00:45:42.217 --> 00:45:43.479
Great. great.

747
00:45:43.566 --> 00:45:44.742
I'm going out.

748
00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:46.047
What?

749
00:45:46.134 --> 00:45:47.396
I'm seeing Jasper.

750
00:45:47.483 --> 00:45:48.702
- Oh.
- You really think tonight

751
00:45:48.789 --> 00:45:50.225
is the time for you

752
00:45:50.312 --> 00:45:52.575
to dip your butt
back to the dating pool?

753
00:45:52.662 --> 00:45:56.275
Well. you know. there's
something off about him.

754
00:45:56.362 --> 00:45:58.886
Something he's not telling us.

755
00:45:58.973 --> 00:46:02.324
And you're gonna use your
vagina to get it outta him?

756
00:46:04.892 --> 00:46:06.546
No. babe.

757
00:46:07.286 --> 00:46:09.114
But for all we know. he's got
something to do with this.

758
00:46:09.201 --> 00:46:11.420
So. you know what they say.

759
00:46:11.507 --> 00:46:14.032
keep your friends close but
keep your enemies closer.

760
00:46:15.033 --> 00:46:18.384
Yeah. you know what they
also say? Don't fuck the enemy.

761
00:46:19.646 --> 00:46:21.126
Focus on tomorrow.

762
00:46:21.387 --> 00:46:24.694
Make sure you understand
exactly what needs to be done.

763
00:46:24.782 --> 00:46:27.480
We mess up. we're all dead.

764
00:46:27.567 --> 00:46:28.873
Don't wait up.

765
00:46:48.718 --> 00:46:51.852
Wow.
You clean up nice.

766
00:46:51.939 --> 00:46:54.333
And you barely
cleaned up at all.

767
00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:56.639
Vodka martini.
shaken. not stirred.

768
00:47:00.905 --> 00:47:03.777
So. are you surprised I called?

769
00:47:04.691 --> 00:47:05.735
No.

770
00:47:06.475 --> 00:47:07.737
I'm not.

771
00:47:07.825 --> 00:47:09.087
I'm more surprised you called

772
00:47:09.217 --> 00:47:11.089
and you're not in
some kind of trouble.

773
00:47:11.654 --> 00:47:12.699
Funny.

774
00:47:14.483 --> 00:47:16.094
How's the trip going so far?

775
00:47:17.791 --> 00:47:20.141
Mm. could be better.
Could be worse.

776
00:47:21.142 --> 00:47:22.317
Right.

777
00:47:24.537 --> 00:47:26.017
What about Daisy?

778
00:47:27.496 --> 00:47:30.325
Daisy seemed a little
shaken up the other night.

779
00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:34.590
Daisy. you know. she's Daisy.

780
00:47:34.677 --> 00:47:37.245
Always seems to
get in trouble. but

781
00:47:37.332 --> 00:47:39.421
always finds her way out.

782
00:47:40.379 --> 00:47:41.380
Cheers.

783
00:47:42.076 --> 00:47:43.251
Right.

784
00:47:45.558 --> 00:47:47.734
What's your deal. Diamond?

785
00:47:48.517 --> 00:47:51.607
I feel like there's a lot
going on inside of you that

786
00:47:51.694 --> 00:47:53.609
you don't allow people to see.

787
00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:56.090
There's always more.

788
00:47:56.177 --> 00:47:57.744
Okay. go on.

789
00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:04.098
Look. everyone thinks
growing up in Hollywood.

790
00:48:04.185 --> 00:48:05.839
jumping around the world.

791
00:48:05.926 --> 00:48:09.321
they think this life
is a dream come true.

792
00:48:10.365 --> 00:48:11.714
And in so many ways it is.

793
00:48:13.107 --> 00:48:16.589
But. my mom left
when I was a kid.

794
00:48:18.156 --> 00:48:20.985
One night she just
packed up and was gone.

795
00:48:21.072 --> 00:48:22.638
No goodbyes. nothing.

796
00:48:24.597 --> 00:48:28.383
My dad took it really hard.
He struggled for years.

797
00:48:29.297 --> 00:48:31.691
He put all his
energy into his work.

798
00:48:31.778 --> 00:48:34.563
and nothing else mattered.

799
00:48:35.695 --> 00:48:37.175
Not even me.

800
00:48:38.872 --> 00:48:42.093
I guess work became his drug and

801
00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:45.748
then it was success.
and now it's the girls.

802
00:48:45.835 --> 00:48:47.794
Trying to make him
feel young again.

803
00:48:49.361 --> 00:48:52.668
And. in the midst of all this.

804
00:48:53.887 --> 00:48:55.280
I had to grow up on my own.

805
00:48:57.499 --> 00:49:01.547
Figure out who I really am
and what I really want and

806
00:49:02.896 --> 00:49:04.158
I think I'm still trying.

807
00:49:06.465 --> 00:49:08.641
I think you're doing
a pretty good job.

808
00:49:13.385 --> 00:49:14.603
You wanna take a walk?

809
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:18.216
Mm-hm.

810
00:49:19.652 --> 00:49:22.263
So. what's your deal. Jasper?

811
00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:23.482
Me?

812
00:49:23.743 --> 00:49:25.658
Yeah. the man
with many questions

813
00:49:25.745 --> 00:49:27.399
and never a single answer.

814
00:49:27.921 --> 00:49:29.140
Um.

815
00:49:32.621 --> 00:49:35.276
There's not really much
glitz and glamor in my life.

816
00:49:35.363 --> 00:49:36.930
I mean...

817
00:49:38.062 --> 00:49:40.281
my parents split
up when I was young

818
00:49:40.368 --> 00:49:44.546
and. careful. my dad
was a New York cop.

819
00:49:44.633 --> 00:49:46.200
Mm?

820
00:49:46.287 --> 00:49:49.769
My mom took
a cushy job in LA and

821
00:49:50.465 --> 00:49:53.207
kinda. just like you.
was fending for my own.

822
00:49:53.294 --> 00:49:54.382
Right?

823
00:49:54.643 --> 00:49:56.471
We had enough to
make ends meet. but

824
00:49:57.690 --> 00:50:00.519
pretty much raised
myself. you know.

825
00:50:00.606 --> 00:50:04.392
Don't know if I did a good job.

826
00:50:05.306 --> 00:50:07.874
but yeah. flying is

827
00:50:09.223 --> 00:50:11.704
the only thing that
made me feel free.

828
00:50:13.227 --> 00:50:16.970
Flying up there. high
above my troubles.

829
00:50:19.799 --> 00:50:20.887
I guess we have more in common

830
00:50:20.974 --> 00:50:22.367
with each other than we thought.

831
00:50:22.454 --> 00:50:23.542
Yeah.

Wow. well that
was a long drink.

845
00:52:43.290 --> 00:52:44.813
Fuck you.

846
00:52:45.074 --> 00:52:47.860
I see what you mean about
keeping the enemies close.

847
00:52:47.947 --> 00:52:51.559
Did you find
anything out at least?

848
00:52:51.646 --> 00:52:55.302
Yeah. I found out
we can't trust Jasper.

849
00:52:55.389 --> 00:52:56.869
Oh. shit.

850
00:52:57.435 --> 00:52:59.741
You have
all the supplies?

851
00:52:59.828 --> 00:53:01.439
Yeah.[Diamond] You got everything?

852
00:53:01.526 --> 00:53:02.875
Mm-hm.
Everything.

853
00:53:03.049 --> 00:53:04.616
You understand exactly
what we're doing?

854
00:53:04.703 --> 00:53:06.922
Diamond. we're fine.

855
00:53:08.968 --> 00:53:11.100
Follow the plan.
we get Daisy back.

856
00:53:12.058 --> 00:53:14.582
Follow the plan.
we get Daisy back.

857
00:53:14.669 --> 00:53:17.194
Follow the plan.
we get Daisy back.

858
00:53:33.993 --> 00:53:36.648
Another victim
falls to our Goliath.

859
00:53:36.735 --> 00:53:39.651
There is no obstacle
in our path.

860
00:53:39.738 --> 00:53:43.524
He will be the next
undisputed champion.

861
00:53:43.872 --> 00:53:46.092
He is unstoppable.

862
00:53:46.179 --> 00:53:49.661
Another day. and he's
destroyed everyone in sight.

863
00:53:52.968 --> 00:53:54.535
Got time for one more?

864
00:53:56.972 --> 00:53:58.147
A woman?

865
00:53:59.410 --> 00:54:01.586
Here's our buy-in.
Ryder. go get ready.

866
00:54:04.153 --> 00:54:06.678
You just bought a ticket
for your friend's funeral.

867
00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:09.681
Do you have a name?

868
00:54:09.768 --> 00:54:11.030
Diamond.

869
00:54:11.378 --> 00:54:12.292
Just Diamond?

870
00:54:12.379 --> 00:54:13.728
Just Diamond.

871
00:54:13.902 --> 00:54:15.861
And what brings you to
my country. Just Diamond?

872
00:54:15.948 --> 00:54:17.471
I'm here on vacation.

873
00:54:17.558 --> 00:54:19.386
And how has that been so far?

874
00:54:19.952 --> 00:54:21.780
Pretty uneventful.

875
00:54:22.389 --> 00:54:24.609
We'll certainly have
to change that. won't we?

876
00:54:29.091 --> 00:54:30.354
I'm counting on that.

877
00:54:44.106 --> 00:54:46.283
I'll be gracious and
keep all your money.

878
00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:47.675
Tell your friend to go home.

879
00:54:47.762 --> 00:54:49.416
She has nothing to prove.

880
00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:51.549
Perhaps we can get to know
each other a little better.

881
00:54:51.636 --> 00:54:55.509
How about I make
you that same offer?

882
00:55:18.489 --> 00:55:20.665
I've been saving this
for a special occasion.

883
00:55:21.579 --> 00:55:22.536
You found it.

884
00:56:03.795 --> 00:56:05.362
The end is near for your friend.

885
00:56:06.406 --> 00:56:08.190
Shall we double the wager?

886
00:56:08.277 --> 00:56:12.064
Diamond. you shine
bright. but clearly flawed.

887
00:57:07.772 --> 00:57:09.251
I've never lost in anything.

888
00:57:15.214 --> 00:57:16.389
Let's fuck.

889
00:57:35.669 --> 00:57:37.236
What kind of girl
do you think I am?

890
00:57:37.323 --> 00:57:39.456
Ryder. grab your shit
and let's get out of here.

891
00:58:00.607 --> 00:58:02.870
Did you really think you
would leave without me?

892
00:58:02.957 --> 00:58:04.219
Get in.

893
00:58:08.397 --> 00:58:10.051
I thought you'd never ask.

894
00:58:13.359 --> 00:58:14.491
Let's go.

895
00:58:18.973 --> 00:58:20.322
Holy fuck. we did it.

896
00:58:20.888 --> 00:58:22.499
My heart's about to explode.

897
00:58:22.586 --> 00:58:24.892
Guys. this is still
so far from over.

898
00:58:24.979 --> 00:58:26.981
How many sleeping pills did
you shoot him up with?

899
00:58:27.068 --> 00:58:28.853
Enough.

900
00:58:40.255 --> 00:58:43.694

901
00:58:44.651 --> 00:58:47.045

908
00:59:17.379 --> 00:59:19.686
Who the fuck are you. girls?

909
00:59:19.773 --> 00:59:21.645
Do you know who I am?

910
00:59:23.211 --> 00:59:25.649
You just signed your death wish!

911
00:59:25.736 --> 00:59:27.868
Come on. we just want to talk.

912
00:59:27.955 --> 00:59:29.827
Shit.

913
00:59:29.914 --> 00:59:33.004
Didn't your mother
teach you any manners?

914
00:59:33.091 --> 00:59:35.615
Don't waste your energy.
You're tied up pretty good.

915
00:59:37.182 --> 00:59:38.270
Where am I?

916
00:59:38.357 --> 00:59:39.663
Where you are doesn't matter.

917
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:42.404
Where our friend Daisy is does.

918
00:59:42.491 --> 00:59:43.971
What is Daisy?

919
00:59:44.058 --> 00:59:46.713
Daisy is our friend that
your cartel kidnapped.

920
00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:48.193
And I know nothing of this.

921
00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:49.716
You see. that I believe.

922
00:59:49.803 --> 00:59:51.631
But all we wanted was
to come to Phuket.

923
00:59:51.718 --> 00:59:53.938
have a little vacay.
maybe dance a bit.

924
00:59:54.025 --> 00:59:55.766
drink a bit. fuck a bit.

925
00:59:55.853 --> 00:59:57.985
But that just isn't
happening now.

926
00:59:58.072 --> 00:59:59.291
She's right.

927
00:59:59.552 --> 01:00:01.249
We get back to our
villa on our first night

928
01:00:01.336 --> 01:00:02.816
and my shit-for-crap duffel bag

929
01:00:02.903 --> 01:00:04.557
is full of bricks of cocaine.

930
01:00:04.644 --> 01:00:07.691
Somehow your product got
mixed up with our luggage.

931
01:00:07.778 --> 01:00:08.866
And we wake up the next morning

932
01:00:08.953 --> 01:00:10.824
and our friend Daisy is gone.

933
01:00:28.668 --> 01:00:30.539
Silly bitches.
did you not think

934
01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:32.498
that they would
come looking for me?

935
01:00:32.585 --> 01:00:35.893
Oh sweetheart.
of course we did.

936
01:00:42.987 --> 01:00:44.466
We're over here!

937
01:00:44.553 --> 01:00:45.511
Come up here!

938
01:00:45.598 --> 01:00:46.947
Come and get us!

939
01:00:47.121 --> 01:00:48.557
We've kidnapped the head
of the Thai drug cartel.

940
01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:50.516
and he's being held
hostage by three...

941
01:00:50.603 --> 01:00:53.388
Silly. silly bitches!

942
01:00:54.041 --> 01:00:57.349
Oh. you're basically dab
smack in the middle of nowhere.

943
01:00:57.436 --> 01:01:01.614
No one can hear you. and no
one is ever going to find you.

944
01:01:03.485 --> 01:01:06.097
See. we needed
something more valuable

945
01:01:06.184 --> 01:01:08.186
than coke to get her back.

946
01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:10.710
We needed you.

947
01:01:21.852 --> 01:01:23.375
Oh. your boyfriend's here.

948
01:01:25.856 --> 01:01:27.118
You have a boyfriend?

949
01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:28.815
Sorry. man.

950
01:01:32.819 --> 01:01:34.560
I'm gonna go see what he wants.

951
01:01:38.564 --> 01:01:40.044
Jasper?

952
01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.177
What are you doing here?

953
01:01:47.573 --> 01:01:49.096
Well you left rather
quickly in the morning.

954
01:01:49.183 --> 01:01:50.576
so I thought I'd
just check up on you.

955
01:01:50.663 --> 01:01:52.317
I'm fine. I'm a big girl.

956
01:01:52.404 --> 01:01:54.232
I don't need anyone
checking in on me.

957
01:01:55.537 --> 01:01:56.974
Diamond. there's something
you should know. okay?

958
01:01:57.061 --> 01:01:59.150
Don't move an inch more.

959
01:01:59.237 --> 01:02:02.414
I will light you up. Jasper.
or whoever the fuck you are.

960
01:02:02.501 --> 01:02:04.024
Diamond. put the
gun down. okay?

961
01:02:04.111 --> 01:02:07.636
Come on. I know you're
involved in all this.

962
01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:09.203
I found Ryder's
bag in your room.

963
01:02:09.290 --> 01:02:12.424
All right. you're right.
You're absolutely right.

964
01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:13.860
I've been watching you girls.

965
01:02:14.034 --> 01:02:16.036
but I know all about
the drugs. okay.

966
01:02:16.123 --> 01:02:17.690
Raise your hands.

967
01:02:17.777 --> 01:02:19.431
I'm with the fucking DEA.

968
01:02:21.912 --> 01:02:24.131
The badge is in my back pocket.

969
01:02:25.393 --> 01:02:26.481
Show me.

970
01:02:26.568 --> 01:02:27.961
Slowly.

971
01:02:43.063 --> 01:02:44.195
What the fuck?

972
01:02:50.157 --> 01:02:52.769
They're using your
father's jet as a mule.

973
01:02:52.856 --> 01:02:54.118
They've been chartering
cocaine in and out

974
01:02:54.205 --> 01:02:56.294
of the golden
triangle for years.

975
01:02:56.381 --> 01:02:57.512
We've got the pilot in custody.

976
01:02:57.599 --> 01:02:59.427
He's been working
with the cartel.

977
01:03:00.385 --> 01:03:02.082
Is my dad involved in this?

978
01:03:02.169 --> 01:03:05.564
No. he's not. He doesn't
know anything about it.

979
01:03:05.651 --> 01:03:07.174
What happened?

980
01:03:08.045 --> 01:03:09.786
We hit some bad air.

981
01:03:10.612 --> 01:03:12.745
Got there a little
bit ahead of schedule.

982
01:03:12.832 --> 01:03:14.486
The plan was to make
another run to the US.

983
01:03:14.573 --> 01:03:15.966
Look. I don't know.

984
01:03:16.270 --> 01:03:18.055
Honestly. I don't know
how the bags got mixed up.

985
01:03:18.142 --> 01:03:20.231
But you knew about Daisy
and her being kidnapped.

986
01:03:20.318 --> 01:03:21.710
I do.

987
01:03:26.541 --> 01:03:28.935
I assumed they would come back
to the villa for the bags.

988
01:03:29.022 --> 01:03:31.024
I didn't think they were
gonna snatch up Daisy.

989
01:03:31.982 --> 01:03:34.201
These are bad fucking dudes.

990
01:03:34.288 --> 01:03:37.248
I'm in too deep with them.
I can't blow my cover.

991
01:03:37.335 --> 01:03:39.206
I do have a contact at the DEA.

992
01:03:40.164 --> 01:03:42.122
He's gonna call the embassy.

993
01:03:42.209 --> 01:03:44.733
Hopefully set up a
rescue team for Daisy.

994
01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:46.474
No. no fucking way.

995
01:03:47.171 --> 01:03:48.172
What?

996
01:03:48.259 --> 01:03:49.608
We've got this covered.

997
01:03:49.695 --> 01:03:51.740
What do you got covered?

998
01:03:51.828 --> 01:03:54.047
This is the Thai drug cartel.

999
01:03:54.134 --> 01:03:57.442
Well now that you've
been honest with me.

1000
01:03:57.529 --> 01:03:59.357
I should probably
come clean with you.

1001
01:04:08.801 --> 01:04:10.498
What the fuck is this?

1002
01:04:11.891 --> 01:04:13.414
That's the head of Thai cartel.

1003
01:04:13.501 --> 01:04:14.676
Calm down.

1004
01:04:15.721 --> 01:04:16.765
Calm down.

1005
01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:20.552
D. this isn't a fucking movie.
You're not Wonder Woman.

1006
01:04:20.639 --> 01:04:22.728
Fuck you. Because I'm
a girl. I'm Wonder Woman?

1007
01:04:22.815 --> 01:04:24.643
No. I just don't
want you to get hurt.

1008
01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:29.561
You actually care. don't you?

1009
01:04:29.648 --> 01:04:31.302
Of course I care.

1010
01:04:31.389 --> 01:04:34.435
Let's do it like this.
Just give me 24 hours.

1011
01:04:35.088 --> 01:04:36.960
If we can't get Daisy
back on our own.

1012
01:04:37.047 --> 01:04:38.526
do what you need to do.

1013
01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:40.659
But. you know. best-case
scenario. we rescue Daisy.

1014
01:04:40.746 --> 01:04:42.661
you get to keep your
cover and we all go back

1015
01:04:42.748 --> 01:04:46.056
to our lives before
all this mess.

1016
01:04:48.623 --> 01:04:50.712
I can't believe
I'm gonna say this.

1017
01:04:51.975 --> 01:04:54.064
You've got 24 hours. okay?

1018
01:04:55.326 --> 01:04:56.631
Oh wait.

1019
01:04:57.632 --> 01:04:59.852
There's one thing I'm
gonna need from you.

1020
01:04:59.939 --> 01:05:01.419
Yeah. what's that?

1021
01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:04.291
Meet me here tomorrow
morning. I'll explain then.

1022
01:05:07.338 --> 01:05:08.426
So cute.

1023
01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:10.819
Anyway.

1024
01:05:30.187 --> 01:05:31.623
Are you trying to scare me?

1025
01:05:32.406 --> 01:05:33.842
Are you kidding me?

1026
01:05:34.408 --> 01:05:37.194
Do you not think I've
been tortured before?

1027
01:05:37.281 --> 01:05:39.196
Oh. ye of little faith.

1028
01:05:40.632 --> 01:05:41.676
Muzzle this fucker.

1029
01:05:44.897 --> 01:05:47.334
Oh Ryder. what the fuck?

1030
01:05:47.421 --> 01:05:49.032
You're not the
only one with toys.

1031
01:05:50.207 --> 01:05:51.338
And it's pink.

1032
01:05:51.425 --> 01:05:52.513
Okay.

1033
01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:03.568
<i>You think there's a game?</i>

1034
01:06:03.655 --> 01:06:05.700
<i>You must not value
your friend's life.</i>

1035
01:06:05.787 --> 01:06:08.747
Well. I guess we don't.
So fucking kill her.

1036
01:06:08.834 --> 01:06:10.575
<i>Don't push me. little girls.</i>

1037
01:06:10.662 --> 01:06:12.142
<i>How do you know she's
not already dead?</i>

1038
01:06:12.229 --> 01:06:14.666
Oh. because I
have what you want.

1039
01:06:14.753 --> 01:06:15.928
and the only way you're
gonna get it back

1040
01:06:16.015 --> 01:06:17.843
is by giving me what I want.

1041
01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:20.889
<i>And you think you have
leverage? You don't.</i>

1042
01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:23.370
<i>I don't give a fuck
about the coke!</i>

1043
01:06:23.457 --> 01:06:26.460
But. Spyder. it's not the
coke that is our leverage.

1044
01:06:26.547 --> 01:06:28.114
It's the delivery boy.

1045
01:06:32.553 --> 01:06:34.555
<i>Jesus Fucking Christ.</i>

1046
01:06:34.642 --> 01:06:36.949
Meet me tomorrow at the
Big Buddha Temple. same time.

1047
01:06:37.036 --> 01:06:39.821
You wanna see him alive.
you do exactly as I say.

1048
01:06:44.522 --> 01:06:45.523
Unmuzzle him.

1049
01:06:49.744 --> 01:06:52.443
Do you think you're gonna
leave that place alive?

1050
01:06:52.530 --> 01:06:53.922
Oh. who's the fool now?

1051
01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:55.707
We have no intention
to ever meet there

1052
01:06:55.794 --> 01:06:57.317
or anywhere tomorrow.

1053
01:06:57.404 --> 01:06:59.145
Now. you're gonna
tell us where the fuck

1054
01:06:59.232 --> 01:07:00.451
your goons are
keeping our friend.

1055
01:07:00.538 --> 01:07:01.930
Or what?

1056
01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:03.541
You gonna cut off my finger?

1057
01:07:03.628 --> 01:07:05.108
Mm. something like that.

1058
01:07:06.805 --> 01:07:10.504
Ladies and gentlemen.

1077
01:08:22.968 --> 01:08:28.016
Listen closely. I am the
big bad motherfucking wolf.

1078
01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:30.062
So you're gonna tell
me where Daisy is.

1079
01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:32.412
One chance. right now.

1080
01:08:32.847 --> 01:08:35.633
Or I'm gonna huff.
and I'm gonna huff

1081
01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:38.505
and I'm gonna cut
your fucking dick off.

1082
01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:40.725
Ah.

1083
01:08:42.509 --> 01:08:45.251
You better think carefully
about your next word.

1084
01:08:57.655 --> 01:08:59.309
There's a factory.

1085
01:09:01.354 --> 01:09:03.922
Your friend is being held

1086
01:09:04.618 --> 01:09:05.532
there.

1087
01:09:05.619 --> 01:09:07.230
What else?

1088
01:09:07.534 --> 01:09:10.668
We need location. security and
any surprises along the way.

1089
01:09:11.495 --> 01:09:13.714
Remember. if we
don't find Daisy.

1090
01:09:13.801 --> 01:09:18.719
no one is ever
going to find you.

1091
01:09:20.068 --> 01:09:21.592
Snip. snip.

1092
01:09:24.551 --> 01:09:26.597
Well. finally my bag's here.

1093
01:09:26.684 --> 01:09:29.339
At least I can get outta
these nip clips and minis.

1094
01:09:29.426 --> 01:09:30.818
No offense. guys.

1095
01:09:35.301 --> 01:09:37.825
Okay. I never. like.
literally never thought

1096
01:09:37.912 --> 01:09:40.741
I would ever utter
these words. but. Ryder.

1097
01:09:40.828 --> 01:09:43.744
you're gonna need to lend
Ezra and me something to wear.

1098
01:09:43.831 --> 01:09:45.311
No.

1099
01:09:45.398 --> 01:09:46.704
With pleasure.

1100
01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:49.968
All right. what about Koon.
what are we doing with him?

1101
01:09:50.055 --> 01:09:51.752
Well for now. he
stays locked away.

1102
01:09:51.883 --> 01:09:53.798
No one will find him until
we decide the time is right.

1103
01:09:53.885 --> 01:09:55.974
We could still
chop his dick off.

1104
01:09:56.061 --> 01:09:58.542
Okay. ladies. let's
get the fuck out of here

1105
01:09:58.629 --> 01:10:00.021
and go bring Daisy home.

1106
01:10:00.108 --> 01:10:01.197
Let me guess.

1107
01:10:01.284 --> 01:10:02.589
No. let me.

1108
01:10:02.676 --> 01:10:03.895

1127
01:10:56.513 --> 01:10:59.342
Okay. according to
Koon. we're not far.

1128
01:10:59.429 --> 01:11:01.387
The compound should be
just up over this ridge.

1129
01:11:02.432 --> 01:11:04.521
Okay.
let's keep it moving.

1130
01:11:09.047 --> 01:11:10.701
Diamond?

1131
01:11:19.318 --> 01:11:20.493
Diamond?

1132
01:11:55.136 --> 01:11:56.268
Jesus Christ.

1133
01:11:57.835 --> 01:11:59.315
Diamond. what have you done?

1134
01:12:05.103 --> 01:12:06.539
Multiple countries
have tried to bring you

1135
01:12:06.626 --> 01:12:08.498
and your family down for years.

1136
01:12:09.499 --> 01:12:11.718
Millions of dollars
in resources spent.

1137
01:12:14.199 --> 01:12:15.722
and it's gonna be
these three girls

1138
01:12:15.896 --> 01:12:18.595
who single-handedly
dismantle the Thai cartel mafia.

1139
01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:22.860
How do you feel about that?

1140
01:12:47.537 --> 01:12:49.147
Okay. you both
understand the plan?

1141
01:12:50.148 --> 01:12:52.455
I extract. you distract.

1142
01:12:52.542 --> 01:12:54.108
Daisy. we're coming for ya.

1143
01:12:54.195 --> 01:12:55.414
All right. let's move.

1144
01:13:35.759 --> 01:13:38.544
Okay. Ryder's in.
Take your position.

1145
01:13:38.631 --> 01:13:40.633
Make sure to be ready for us.

1146
01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:43.114
We're gonna have to fucking
hightail it out of there.

1147
01:13:43.201 --> 01:13:45.812
Diamond. I just want
you to know that I'm sorry.

1148
01:13:45.899 --> 01:13:49.773
Ezra. let's just cross this
first bridge for Daisy. okay?

1149
01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:51.122
Okay.

1150
01:14:35.775 --> 01:14:37.951
Okay. the charge is set.

1151
01:14:38.561 --> 01:14:40.780
Charge is set.

1152
01:14:40.867 --> 01:14:42.347
Charge set.

1153
01:15:46.498 --> 01:15:48.456
Finally. we meet.

1154
01:15:48.544 --> 01:15:49.719
Fuck you.

1155
01:15:49.806 --> 01:15:51.634
Spare the
impertinence. my darling.

1156
01:15:51.721 --> 01:15:54.114
Now. where's Tok Koon?

1157
01:15:54.201 --> 01:15:55.551
He's safe.

1158
01:15:55.638 --> 01:15:57.117
Safe?

1159
01:15:57.204 --> 01:15:59.598
You think you're so
beautiful. so smart.

1160
01:15:59.685 --> 01:16:01.469
You think you're a bunch
of American cowgirls.

1161
01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:03.776
you're gonna ride in
here and save the day?

1162
01:16:03.863 --> 01:16:05.299
I don't think so.

1163
01:16:05.386 --> 01:16:08.346
You know why?
Because you're nothing.

1164
01:16:08.433 --> 01:16:09.565
You're fucking nothing.

1165
01:16:12.698 --> 01:16:14.482
I would think
twice about that.

1166
01:16:20.706 --> 01:16:22.578
I got the cocksucker.

1167
01:16:32.936 --> 01:16:34.328
- Daisy!
- Ryder!

1168
01:16:36.896 --> 01:16:38.071
Ryder!

1169
01:17:28.426 --> 01:17:29.470
Ryder!

1170
01:17:31.124 --> 01:17:32.169
Ryder.

1171
01:17:32.430 --> 01:17:33.823
Are you okay?

1172
01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:35.128
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Are you okay?

1173
01:17:35.215 --> 01:17:36.303
I'm fine.

1174
01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:37.827
And what did I tell you?

1175
01:17:37.914 --> 01:17:39.742
I am a fucking badass.

1176
01:17:39.829 --> 01:17:41.134
Yes. you are.

1177
01:17:41.221 --> 01:17:43.789
Daisy. Daisy. I love you.

1178
01:17:43.876 --> 01:17:46.096
I fucking love you. Ryder.

1179
01:17:52.885 --> 01:17:55.671
Now let's get outta here.
Come on.

1180
01:18:00.284 --> 01:18:02.678
We're taking our
friend. and once we do.

1181
01:18:02.765 --> 01:18:04.854
Koon will be let
out of our custody.

1182
01:18:04.941 --> 01:18:06.594
Why should I believe you?

1183
01:18:06.725 --> 01:18:08.596
You will have double-crossed
the head of the cartel.

1184
01:18:08.684 --> 01:18:11.077
and you're gonna have a lot
more to be worried about

1185
01:18:11.164 --> 01:18:13.950
than just three cowgirls.

1186
01:18:14.037 --> 01:18:17.257
You may walk outta here
today. thinking you've won.

1187
01:18:17.344 --> 01:18:18.824
You haven't.

1188
01:18:19.738 --> 01:18:22.567
'Cause it's not about the ones
who are chasing behind you.

1189
01:18:22.654 --> 01:18:25.570
It's about the ones who are
already there ahead of you.

1190
01:18:25.657 --> 01:18:28.138
We're gonna find you. catch you.

1191
01:18:28.225 --> 01:18:30.009
and we're gonna kill all of you.

1192
01:18:30.096 --> 01:18:32.969
Revenge is gonna be sweet juice

1193
01:18:33.056 --> 01:18:34.666
that I lick off
your dead bodies.

1194
01:18:36.189 --> 01:18:37.364
Drink this.

1195
01:18:38.757 --> 01:18:40.411
You asshole.

1196
01:18:40.498 --> 01:18:41.673
No!

1197
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:46.983
Oh my God.
Thank God. you're okay.

1198
01:18:47.070 --> 01:18:49.289
I'm fine. I just wanna
get the fuck outta here.

1199
01:18:49.376 --> 01:18:50.638
Please tell me you've
done your last line.

1200
01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:52.640
Good to see you too. Diamond.

1201
01:18:53.293 --> 01:18:55.208
Diamond. no!

1202
01:19:23.628 --> 01:19:24.672
Go. go. go!

1203
01:19:40.688 --> 01:19:44.083
I was fucking shot.
Oh. fuck!

1204
01:19:44.170 --> 01:19:45.215
Hey. you're gonna be fine.

1205
01:19:45.519 --> 01:19:46.433
Just keep pressure
on your wound.

1206
01:19:47.043 --> 01:19:48.261
Diamond. I'm really
sorry. I'm so sorry.

1207
01:19:48.348 --> 01:19:49.872
Screw it.

1208
01:19:50.133 --> 01:19:53.049
After this. you can fuck
anyone you want in my family.

1209
01:19:57.575 --> 01:19:59.098
Hasta la vista. bitches.

1210
01:20:15.462 --> 01:20:17.029
Did they get Ryder?

1211
01:20:17.116 --> 01:20:18.639
No. they didn't get Ryder.

1212
01:20:18.726 --> 01:20:20.946
That was motherfucking Ryder!

1213
01:20:28.911 --> 01:20:29.912
Okay. we're almost there.

1214
01:20:29.999 --> 01:20:31.043
Almost where?

1215
01:20:31.914 --> 01:20:34.351
God. we've got company.

1216
01:20:45.057 --> 01:20:47.538
Daisy. it's time for
a little payback.

1217
01:20:48.408 --> 01:20:50.454
Just release the
clip. aim and fire.

1218
01:20:51.759 --> 01:20:53.370
You got this. D.

1219
01:21:08.776 --> 01:21:10.126
Fuck yeah!

1220
01:21:13.869 --> 01:21:15.435
Oh. fuck it hurts!

1221
01:21:15.696 --> 01:21:16.872
You're gonna be fine.
I promise you're gonna be fine.

1222
01:21:16.959 --> 01:21:18.612
Just take it easy. okay.

1223
01:21:18.699 --> 01:21:19.570
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

1224
01:21:19.657 --> 01:21:20.614
It's jammed!

1225
01:21:20.701 --> 01:21:22.268
Hold tight. ladies.

1226
01:21:54.605 --> 01:21:55.649
Ah.

1227
01:21:58.174 --> 01:22:00.567
You almost fucking
got away with it.

1228
01:22:00.654 --> 01:22:02.482
You almost rode off
into the sunset.

1229
01:22:02.569 --> 01:22:04.658
And what makes you
think we haven't?

1230
01:22:04.745 --> 01:22:06.660
Look around you. Cowgirl.

1231
01:22:06.747 --> 01:22:09.446
Remember?
I warned you.

1232
01:22:10.534 --> 01:22:12.014
You sure did.

1233
01:22:16.496 --> 01:22:18.063
Yeehaw. motherfucker.

1234
01:22:25.070 --> 01:22:27.377
All right. everybody.
get on the fucking ground!

1235
01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:30.946
Get down!
Move! Get down!

1236
01:22:32.556 --> 01:22:34.340
Stay down.
motherfucker!

1237
01:23:17.166 --> 01:23:18.602
Ladies. welcome aboard.

1238
01:23:18.776 --> 01:23:21.257
I'll be your pilot.
Jasper McDaniel. Hm-hm.

1239
01:23:51.722 --> 01:23:56.335
Was this like the best
girls trip ever or what?

1240
01:23:56.422 --> 01:23:58.555
Actually. yes.

1241
01:23:58.642 --> 01:23:59.947
By the way. when
did the two of you

1242
01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:01.514
start munching on each other?

1243
01:24:02.863 --> 01:24:03.995
Diamond. shut up.
They're cute.

1244
01:24:04.082 --> 01:24:05.649
I mean. they might be in love.

1245
01:24:06.432 --> 01:24:07.868
You're not wrong.

1246
01:24:08.521 --> 01:24:10.480
Seriously. for
better or worse.

1247
01:24:10.567 --> 01:24:12.134
this is the trip
I'll never forget.

1248
01:24:12.221 --> 01:24:14.005
I mean. Ezra just
took a fucking bullet.

1249
01:24:14.092 --> 01:24:16.573
repaired her broken
relationship with Diamond.

1250
01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:19.228
and Diamond for once in her
life has actually found someone

1251
01:24:19.315 --> 01:24:20.533
she likes more than herself.

1252
01:24:22.274 --> 01:24:25.147
And I. for once.
can be the real me.

1253
01:24:29.238 --> 01:24:31.109
Allow me.
just a little toast.

1254
01:24:31.196 --> 01:24:32.632
Yes.

1255
01:24:34.547 --> 01:24:35.983
There we go.

1256
01:24:38.073 --> 01:24:40.466
Ladies. to an inspiring
group of heroes.

1257
01:24:40.553 --> 01:24:42.947
Heroes? Fuck that.
we are Sheroes.

1258
01:24:44.035 --> 01:24:46.429
