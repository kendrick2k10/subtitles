179
00:06:43.054 --> 00:06:45.013
He does it
for the love of the game.

180
00:06:45.056 --> 00:06:47.232
-How papered up?
-[Danny] Paper.

181
00:06:47.276 --> 00:06:48.625
-Really?
-Yeah.

182
00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:50.671
Dude. fat money.
It's--dude. it's crazy.

183
00:06:50.714 --> 00:06:53.543
Like. uh. Waterboy said. man.
he got something.

184
00:06:53.587 --> 00:06:55.066
You should go check him out.

185
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.546
Yeah.

186
00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:58.113
So. Fat Mike Pants.

187
00:06:58.156 --> 00:06:59.941
you really should go
gluten-free.

188
00:06:59.984 --> 00:07:02.378
Look. how's this
fucking crowd tonight. bro?

189
00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:04.293
Okay. Put it this way.

190
00:07:04.336 --> 00:07:05.686
The lady who threw the diamond
off the front of the Titanic.

191
00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:08.079
she's in the front row
with her parents.

192
00:07:09.124 --> 00:07:10.299
That's old.

193
00:07:10.342 --> 00:07:11.996
-[laughter]
-[Pete] Fuck!

194
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.171
Let's go. Let me see
his fucking funeral out here.

195
00:07:13.215 --> 00:07:14.477
Yeah. you got it.

196
00:07:14.521 --> 00:07:16.044
-Oh. hey. Pete.
-Yeah?

197
00:07:16.087 --> 00:07:17.872
-Don't suck.
-Damn it!

198
00:07:17.915 --> 00:07:20.004
-[upbeat music playing]
-[laughter]

199
00:07:20.962 --> 00:07:22.442
You're slowing down. bro.

200
00:07:22.485 --> 00:07:25.488
[upbeat music playing]

201
00:07:29.405 --> 00:07:31.015
Oh. you're too kind.
you're too kind.

202
00:07:31.059 --> 00:07:33.017
Are you ready
for some more comedy?

203
00:07:33.061 --> 00:07:34.497
Let me tell you about this
next kid coming to the stage.

204
00:07:34.541 --> 00:07:36.064
He's ridden all the way
from Hungary

205
00:07:36.107 --> 00:07:38.283
and once opened
for Sebastian Bach.

206
00:07:38.327 --> 00:07:41.069
the pianist. not the heavy
metal singer from Skid Row.

207
00:07:41.112 --> 00:07:44.115
Please welcome.
the very funny. Ethan Barr.

208
00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:45.290
Come on. Ethan.

209
00:07:45.334 --> 00:07:46.944
-[applause]
-Yeah.

210
00:07:48.163 --> 00:07:49.207
You'll be fine.

211
00:07:52.123 --> 00:07:53.168
[clears throat]

212
00:07:58.173 --> 00:07:59.479
Hello. everybody.

213
00:08:00.741 --> 00:08:03.221
I am Ethan Barr...

214
00:08:03.265 --> 00:08:06.529
and I am a vampire.

215
00:08:06.573 --> 00:08:10.707
For the record. I'm neither
Team Edward or Team Jacob.

216
00:08:10.751 --> 00:08:12.622
I rooted for the sun.

217
00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:17.105
On account of the daylight...

218
00:08:17.148 --> 00:08:19.324
which is
an urban legend anyways.

219
00:08:19.368 --> 00:08:20.717
[man] Yeah. like your act.

220
00:08:21.762 --> 00:08:23.851
[Ethan] Wow.

221
00:08:23.894 --> 00:08:25.679
I haven't seen a crowd
this tight

222
00:08:25.722 --> 00:08:29.465
since the Venetians
at The Siege of Corfu 1716.

223
00:08:30.553 --> 00:08:31.685
[man] Like. you were there?

224
00:08:32.729 --> 00:08:34.426
I was.

225
00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:37.734
I believe we captured
over 8.000 men that day.

226
00:08:37.778 --> 00:08:38.953
Ha!

227
00:08:40.302 --> 00:08:41.738
That was funny.

228
00:08:41.782 --> 00:08:43.566
[Ethan] You'll have
to excuse me...

229
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:44.654
-I told you he had something.
-...I'm a bit tired.

230
00:08:44.698 --> 00:08:46.830
That was definitely something!

231
00:08:47.962 --> 00:08:49.137
[Roy] Hey. I told you
[indistinct]

232
00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:50.312
[Ethan] The [indistinct]

233
00:08:50.355 --> 00:08:51.792
This is like a derailment. bro.

234
00:08:51.835 --> 00:08:53.663
And. boy. are my arms tired.

235
00:08:53.707 --> 00:08:55.273
How much time has he got left?

236
00:08:55.317 --> 00:08:56.797
He's got like a minute.

237
00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:57.798
[Ethan] And he pulls out
a used tampon.

238
00:08:57.841 --> 00:08:59.103
No. in his career.

239
00:08:59.147 --> 00:09:02.106
[laughs] He's got like a minute.

240
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:04.282
Told you it was hilarious.

241
00:09:04.326 --> 00:09:06.328
All right. Let me go abort this.

242
00:09:06.371 --> 00:09:08.156
That is club's night in Texas.

243
00:09:08.199 --> 00:09:11.376
[laughs] I'll light you at five.

244
00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.074
All right.

245
00:09:13.117 --> 00:09:14.902
-All right. Kill it. Champ.
-[applause]

246
00:09:14.945 --> 00:09:17.252
-Where are you going?
-I think I just sharted.

247
00:09:17.295 --> 00:09:19.820
[Roy] Folks. keep it going
for Ethan Barr.

248
00:09:19.863 --> 00:09:21.865
He's new. He's tired.

249
00:09:21.909 --> 00:09:24.607
[man] [indistinct]
right over here.

250
00:09:24.651 --> 00:09:27.567
Wow. you're Pete Brennan.

251
00:09:29.394 --> 00:09:30.570
It's a pleasure.

252
00:09:31.745 --> 00:09:33.877
Hey. buddy. How are you?

253
00:09:35.052 --> 00:09:36.924
I saw you in the back.

254
00:09:36.967 --> 00:09:38.055
Okay.

255
00:09:38.099 --> 00:09:39.317
I didn't realize it was you...

256
00:09:40.318 --> 00:09:41.929
until I did.

257
00:09:41.972 --> 00:09:43.887
Oh. yeah.
I was the guy who laughed.

258
00:09:43.931 --> 00:09:45.759
And again. thank you for that.

259
00:09:45.802 --> 00:09:48.283
They say. "If you can reach
just one person." right?

260
00:09:48.326 --> 00:09:50.633
They do say that. Yeah.

261
00:09:50.677 --> 00:09:51.765
Is that what they say?

262
00:09:51.808 --> 00:09:53.462
I think so.

263
00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:56.639
Bro. could you get closer or--

264
00:09:56.683 --> 00:09:58.119
-I could.
-I'd rather you not.

265
00:09:58.162 --> 00:10:00.295
-Okay.
-Jesus Christ. dude.

266
00:10:02.732 --> 00:10:04.691
The real reason I came over here

267
00:10:04.734 --> 00:10:06.301
was to see if...

268
00:10:06.344 --> 00:10:07.998
-Yeah?
-...you ever needed

269
00:10:08.042 --> 00:10:11.001
an opener or even had
any tips for me.

270
00:10:11.045 --> 00:10:13.482
I'd be...

271
00:10:13.525 --> 00:10:14.570
very thankful.

272
00:10:15.745 --> 00:10:16.964
You're looking for a tip?

273
00:10:17.007 --> 00:10:19.314
That would be incredible.

274
00:10:19.357 --> 00:10:20.924
Here's a tip.

275
00:10:20.968 --> 00:10:24.667
Uh. try not to talk
to the headliner's ear off

276
00:10:24.711 --> 00:10:26.495
before he's about
to take the stage.

277
00:10:26.538 --> 00:10:27.931
Hear me?

278
00:10:27.975 --> 00:10:29.629
Yeah.

279
00:10:29.672 --> 00:10:31.239
Okay?

280
00:10:31.282 --> 00:10:32.936
Fucking Chatty Cathy.

281
00:10:34.721 --> 00:10:36.374
It's Ethan.

282
00:10:36.418 --> 00:10:38.072
The Insurrectionist of Comedy.

283
00:10:38.115 --> 00:10:41.336
Mr. Pete Brennan.

284
00:10:41.379 --> 00:10:44.687
[cheers and applause]

285
00:10:44.731 --> 00:10:46.254
[man] Don't [indistinct] bro.

286
00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:54.436
Don't talk to comic.

287
00:10:54.479 --> 00:10:56.133
Oh. my God.

288
00:10:56.177 --> 00:10:57.569
Good stuff.

289
00:10:57.613 --> 00:10:59.615
It's like shooting fish
in a barrel.

290
00:11:01.008 --> 00:11:03.488
Uh. sorry. You'll get them
next time. buddy.

291
00:11:03.532 --> 00:11:05.055
Give it up for. uh. your host.

292
00:11:05.099 --> 00:11:06.840
Roy Shackleford. everybody.

293
00:11:06.883 --> 00:11:08.406
That's right.

294
00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:10.060
[applause]

295
00:11:10.104 --> 00:11:11.540
Give it up
for Count Dracula. everybody.

296
00:11:11.583 --> 00:11:13.281
He was. uh...

297
00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:17.067
He was so scary.

298
00:11:17.111 --> 00:11:18.721
He scared
the laughs away. right?

299
00:11:18.765 --> 00:11:20.549
[laughter]

300
00:11:20.592 --> 00:11:23.160
When he's here.
it's a two-pint minimum.

301
00:11:23.204 --> 00:11:25.336
Yeah.

302
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.643
Good thing he sleeps
in a coffin

303
00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:29.601
because he died up here.

304
00:11:29.645 --> 00:11:33.823
I mean. he was--
whew. he was so bad.

305
00:11:33.867 --> 00:11:36.652
he made me wanna drive a stake
through my own heart. right?

306
00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:38.828
Even just. you know.
just a bit.

307
00:11:38.872 --> 00:11:43.137
[laughter. applause]

308
00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.835
Oh. man. Hey. at least
he remembered you.

309
00:11:45.879 --> 00:11:47.489
[Pete] ...this Dracula guy?

310
00:11:47.532 --> 00:11:49.709
Oh. come on. Let's get you
a drink. all right?

311
00:11:49.752 --> 00:11:51.275
How about a Bloody Mary?

312
00:11:51.319 --> 00:11:53.625
Maybe for you. hold the Mary.

313
00:11:53.669 --> 00:11:56.150
[laughter]

314
00:11:56.193 --> 00:11:57.151
[indistinct chatter]

315
00:11:57.194 --> 00:11:58.282
Hey. Roy.

316
00:11:58.326 --> 00:11:59.806
I'm sorry I missed my set.

317
00:11:59.849 --> 00:12:01.982
Whatever. man. Ethan covered it.

318
00:12:02.025 --> 00:12:03.505
Of all the people. him?

319
00:12:03.548 --> 00:12:05.942
Well. yeah.
You weren't here on time.

320
00:12:05.986 --> 00:12:08.379
He was the worst student
in our class.

321
00:12:08.423 --> 00:12:11.208
His stupid Twilight joke
isn't even accurate. all right?

322
00:12:11.252 --> 00:12:14.168
Everybody knows
Edward sparkles in the sun

323
00:12:14.211 --> 00:12:17.562
and frickin' Jacob
is a frickin' werewolf. dude.

324
00:12:17.606 --> 00:12:19.086
Come on. man!

325
00:12:19.129 --> 00:12:20.435
This guy needs
his own identity. you know?

326
00:12:20.478 --> 00:12:22.959
He's just a Baby Bat poser!

327
00:12:23.003 --> 00:12:25.614
-Beverage?
-Oh. God. Perfect timing.

328
00:12:25.657 --> 00:12:26.746
-[Pete] Yeah.
-You buying?

329
00:12:26.789 --> 00:12:27.921
I'm out of drink tickets.

330
00:12:27.964 --> 00:12:30.924
-What the--
-Baby Bat.

331
00:12:31.881 --> 00:12:33.274
Hmm.

332
00:12:33.317 --> 00:12:35.406
How original.

333
00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:38.845
PJ. you. my friend.
are a cosplayer...

334
00:12:38.888 --> 00:12:40.977
a bad movie reboot.

335
00:12:41.891 --> 00:12:44.067
You crave eternity.
yet mistakenly believe

336
00:12:44.111 --> 00:12:49.377
it can be achieved through
nihilistic posts online.

337
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:50.813
And to top it off.

338
00:12:50.857 --> 00:12:54.251
for the rest of your short...

339
00:12:55.296 --> 00:12:56.776
mortal life...

340
00:12:58.299 --> 00:13:00.867
you have to walk around
looking like Cher

341
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:02.956
face-fucked Marilyn Manson.

342
00:13:02.999 --> 00:13:04.653
[electric guitar strums]

343
00:13:09.614 --> 00:13:11.442
I'm not that ugly. am I?

344
00:13:11.486 --> 00:13:14.271
Ugly as a motherfucker.
but use it.

345
00:13:16.056 --> 00:13:17.231
Is he serious?

346
00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:20.451
Thanks for telling the audience
you knocked me up tonight.

347
00:13:20.495 --> 00:13:24.368
Really racked in the cash.
almost cracked minimum wage.

348
00:13:24.412 --> 00:13:26.370
I do what I can
to get you more tips.

349
00:13:26.414 --> 00:13:28.024
Come on. Plus. it's funny.

350
00:13:28.068 --> 00:13:29.809
No. It's hack.

351
00:13:29.852 --> 00:13:31.898
Customers were like.
"When are you due?

352
00:13:31.941 --> 00:13:33.813
Have you picked
out a gender yet?"

353
00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:37.860
Okay.

354
00:13:37.904 --> 00:13:39.775
First of all. gender doesn't
exist as a concept.

355
00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:43.083
so you're cancelled.
and "hack"? Really?

356
00:13:43.126 --> 00:13:44.084
-Come on.
-Is that all

357
00:13:44.127 --> 00:13:45.389
that matters to you?

358
00:13:45.433 --> 00:13:46.608
Well. it's important. I mean--

359
00:13:46.651 --> 00:13:48.479
Hey. Ethan. Great set tonight.

360
00:13:48.523 --> 00:13:51.613
Uh. I do. however. have some.
uh. tips on that Grindr bit.

361
00:13:51.656 --> 00:13:54.311
so we'll talk about it
on Sunday. won't we?

362
00:13:54.355 --> 00:13:57.662
Thank you. Steph.
I appreciate that.

363
00:13:57.706 --> 00:13:59.186
Hello. Pete.

364
00:13:59.229 --> 00:14:00.622
I just wanted to say great set--

365
00:14:00.665 --> 00:14:02.711
What's going on on Sunday?

366
00:14:02.754 --> 00:14:05.757
Well. that's actually what
I wanted to speak to you about.

367
00:14:05.801 --> 00:14:10.937
Sunday evening. I am having
a small to-do at my place

368
00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.374
and I would love it
if you could make it.

369
00:14:13.417 --> 00:14:17.769
And you are gonna have Stephanie
at this to-do?

370
00:14:17.813 --> 00:14:19.162
Yeah. she will be there

371
00:14:19.206 --> 00:14:21.512
as well as Roy. Danny.
a few others.

372
00:14:21.556 --> 00:14:23.123
Nothing crazy.

373
00:14:23.166 --> 00:14:24.907
I wanted to formally invite you
and Steph said

374
00:14:24.951 --> 00:14:26.996
I should do it myself.

375
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.868
I understand if you're busy.

376
00:14:28.911 --> 00:14:30.782
there's no pressure.
but I'd love to have you there.

377
00:14:30.826 --> 00:14:33.263
Okay. Let me tell you something.
okay. bro?

378
00:14:33.307 --> 00:14:35.613
First of all. I don't even
believe that accent.

379
00:14:35.657 --> 00:14:37.789
You're probably
from Cleveland. okay?

380
00:14:37.833 --> 00:14:40.662
Second of all.
comics are only busy

381
00:14:40.705 --> 00:14:43.317
when they're getting busy.
you know what I'm saying?

382
00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.361
Okay.

383
00:14:44.405 --> 00:14:46.624
So. maybe you can come by

384
00:14:46.668 --> 00:14:48.322
and give me some tips
or something.

385
00:14:48.365 --> 00:14:49.976
Oh. my God. dude.

386
00:14:50.019 --> 00:14:51.978
What am I. Reddit?
You're always asking for tips.

387
00:14:52.021 --> 00:14:53.805
I've known you
for eight minutes.

388
00:14:53.849 --> 00:14:55.329
Okay. Here's a tip.

389
00:14:55.372 --> 00:14:57.853
Never try to hit
on the comedy club waitress...

390
00:14:57.897 --> 00:14:59.376
Ooh. but Steph...

391
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.639
...when the comedy club waitress
happens to be

392
00:15:01.683 --> 00:15:05.861
the headliner's girlfriend
at his home club.

393
00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:07.819
Ah.

394
00:15:07.863 --> 00:15:08.951
Yeah. Okay.

395
00:15:08.995 --> 00:15:10.518
[Ethan] So. I'll see you Sunday.

396
00:15:10.561 --> 00:15:13.869
Oh. I can't wait.
We can talk about skin rubs.

397
00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:17.307
When were you gonna tell me
about this Sunday?

398
00:15:17.351 --> 00:15:19.309
Oh. I wanted him to tell you.

399
00:15:19.353 --> 00:15:21.964
Thank you. Steph.

400
00:15:22.008 --> 00:15:23.661
Nope. not doing that.

401
00:15:23.705 --> 00:15:26.099
-Doing what?
-This whole jealousy thing.

402
00:15:26.142 --> 00:15:27.187
-I'm not jealous.
-Yes. you are.

403
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:28.362
-I'm not.
-Uh-hmm.

404
00:15:28.405 --> 00:15:29.929
No need two decades. Pete.

405
00:15:29.972 --> 00:15:31.626
It wasn't cute then
and it ain't cute now.

406
00:15:31.669 --> 00:15:35.151
Besides. I thought we could
actually go out for once.

407
00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.589
I'm out every night.

408
00:15:38.633 --> 00:15:40.417
Yeah. to comedy clubs.

409
00:15:40.461 --> 00:15:42.071
-Yeah.
-But. honey.

410
00:15:42.115 --> 00:15:45.466
when was the last time
that we actually went out?

411
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:47.207
You know I have other
wardrobe besides

412
00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:50.079
jaded cocktail waitress dress
for a funeral. right?

413
00:15:50.123 --> 00:15:51.951
. First of all.
I think you look fantastic.

414
00:15:51.994 --> 00:15:54.431
And second of all.
you can't say the word cocktail

415
00:15:54.475 --> 00:15:55.955
-without saying the word--
-Cock.

416
00:15:55.998 --> 00:15:57.391
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Got it.

417
00:15:57.434 --> 00:15:59.262
Two k-sounds
in a single syllable word.

418
00:15:59.306 --> 00:16:00.872
How prolific.

419
00:16:00.916 --> 00:16:02.657
Can you just turn it off
for two seconds

420
00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.137
and be real with me?

421
00:16:05.051 --> 00:16:06.966
-[sighs] Okay. But look--
-[mumbles]

422
00:16:08.184 --> 00:16:09.403
-I'm going to Ethan's.
-Uh-hmm.

423
00:16:09.446 --> 00:16:10.970
I'd want for you to join.

424
00:16:11.013 --> 00:16:13.842
But if you don't. guess what?
I'm still going.

425
00:16:17.802 --> 00:16:19.935
[sighs] Fine.

426
00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:21.458
I'll go for. like. an hour.
all right. tops?

427
00:16:21.502 --> 00:16:22.851
That's it. But I don't--

428
00:16:23.765 --> 00:16:25.462
Maybe you'll actually
have fun for once.

429
00:16:25.506 --> 00:16:28.813
Oh. and. uh.
maybe get some new material?

430
00:16:28.857 --> 00:16:30.554
[clears throat intentionally]

431
00:16:32.121 --> 00:16:33.514
I concur.

432
00:16:33.557 --> 00:16:34.863
Lick my ass. guys.

433
00:16:34.906 --> 00:16:36.256
Wax that thing.

434
00:16:36.299 --> 00:16:38.649
Tongue punch my fart box.

435
00:16:38.693 --> 00:16:40.086
[laughter]

436
00:16:40.129 --> 00:16:41.739
Lick all around my ass

437
00:16:41.783 --> 00:16:44.481
because even my taint is better

438
00:16:44.525 --> 00:16:46.918
than the five minutes
I saw you guys do tonight.

439
00:16:47.876 --> 00:16:49.443
[phone ringing]

440
00:16:51.793 --> 00:16:53.621
What's up. Chuck?

441
00:16:53.664 --> 00:16:58.539
Ah! The timeless. old puke joke
that never gets funny.

442
00:16:58.582 --> 00:17:00.062
What are you even doing up
it's 12:00 noon?

443
00:17:00.106 --> 00:17:02.021
I'm--I'm actually writing
new jokes.

444
00:17:02.064 --> 00:17:03.196
not that you care.

445
00:17:03.239 --> 00:17:05.024
Actually. I don't.

446
00:17:05.067 --> 00:17:06.808
Now. listen up.
my little meal ticket.

447
00:17:06.851 --> 00:17:08.331
I have a commitment for you
to open up

448
00:17:08.375 --> 00:17:10.290
the brand new
Russell Peters special

449
00:17:10.333 --> 00:17:12.031
taping at the Sahara.

450
00:17:12.074 --> 00:17:15.817
You know. international
superstar Russell Peters.

451
00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:17.340
All right.

452
00:17:17.384 --> 00:17:19.821
I also added a few shitty gigs
to your run.

453
00:17:19.864 --> 00:17:21.518
so check your schedule.

454
00:17:21.562 --> 00:17:23.694
What. another bowling alley
or another taco stand?

455
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.481
Listen. Pete. as your friend...

456
00:17:27.524 --> 00:17:29.700
you know. you wouldn't have to
take all these shitty gigs

457
00:17:29.744 --> 00:17:32.225
if we just stop paying
for all those medical bills?

458
00:17:32.268 --> 00:17:34.357
Come on. Chuck.
No. don't go there. all right?

459
00:17:34.401 --> 00:17:35.837
Look.

460
00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.578
I'm just saying.
there are some other ways.

461
00:17:37.621 --> 00:17:41.060
some of them even legal
for you to dig out of your hole.

462
00:17:41.103 --> 00:17:43.410
There's nothing more American
than filing bankruptcy.

463
00:17:43.453 --> 00:17:46.195
Dude. I looked into it. okay?
It's 2.500 bucks.

464
00:17:46.239 --> 00:17:48.850
I don't even have enough money
to claim I don't have any money.

465
00:17:48.893 --> 00:17:50.982
[laughs] That's hilarious.

466
00:17:51.026 --> 00:17:53.202
Please tell me
you used that in the rotation.

467
00:17:53.246 --> 00:17:54.421
It's not a joke.

468
00:17:54.464 --> 00:17:56.379
Unfortunately. it's my life.

469
00:17:56.423 --> 00:17:59.208
Well. your misery is hilarious.

470
00:18:00.253 --> 00:18:02.298
Okay. look.

471
00:18:02.342 --> 00:18:04.126
I'm only gonna do this
Russell gig

472
00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:05.780
because I wanna be seen
by the network execs.

473
00:18:05.823 --> 00:18:07.173
That's it.

474
00:18:07.216 --> 00:18:09.566
I need you to schmooze
the suits. Chuck.

475
00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:12.047
Do your job. Chuck. No offense.

476
00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:14.223
Huh. Tons taken.

477
00:18:14.267 --> 00:18:15.920
By the way. duly noted.

478
00:18:15.964 --> 00:18:18.184
Listen. do me a favor.

479
00:18:18.227 --> 00:18:19.533
Pick an opener

480
00:18:19.576 --> 00:18:21.143
or one's gonna be appointed
for you.

481
00:18:21.187 --> 00:18:22.536
Hold on. No. Chuck.

482
00:18:22.579 --> 00:18:24.146
I'm not getting stuck
in the road

483
00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:26.888
with one of your social
media influencers.

484
00:18:26.931 --> 00:18:29.195
I don't need somebody
who can't actually tell a joke.

485
00:18:29.238 --> 00:18:31.197
What do you do with them.
you pay for play?

486
00:18:32.459 --> 00:18:34.200
All right.

487
00:18:34.243 --> 00:18:35.331
Now. you can stop pretending
like you're writing jokes.

488
00:18:35.375 --> 00:18:36.506
and go back to watching porn.

489
00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:37.986
Fire a little toddler juice

490
00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:40.945
into a tissue of love.
you weirdo.

491
00:18:40.989 --> 00:18:43.426
I'm not--I'm not on porn.

492
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:45.428
[woman moaning]

493
00:18:45.472 --> 00:18:48.127
[ominous music playing]

494
00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:50.694
Wasn't there a helicopter
in Scarface?

495
00:18:50.738 --> 00:18:52.566
Remember the guy hanging?

496
00:18:52.609 --> 00:18:55.743
This is kind of. like.
a James Bond villain.

497
00:18:55.786 --> 00:18:57.266
Holy.

498
00:18:58.615 --> 00:19:01.314
My God. this is...

499
00:19:01.357 --> 00:19:03.403
Okay. I think
you should slow down.

500
00:19:03.446 --> 00:19:05.187
Why?

501
00:19:05.231 --> 00:19:07.146
You invite me out. the least
I can do is get toasty.

502
00:19:07.189 --> 00:19:08.930
You're toasty enough. trust me.

503
00:19:08.973 --> 00:19:10.932
Get that--you promised.

504
00:19:10.975 --> 00:19:12.194
Oh. God.

505
00:19:12.238 --> 00:19:13.195
I'm gonna knock the door
'cause apparently.

506
00:19:13.239 --> 00:19:14.327
chivalry is dead.

507
00:19:15.719 --> 00:19:18.113
[Pete] I don't wanna
chip my nails.

508
00:19:18.157 --> 00:19:19.506
Like the fun cop is here.

509
00:19:19.549 --> 00:19:21.116
-[door opens]
-What the...

510
00:19:22.248 --> 00:19:23.597
How can I help you guys?

511
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.730
Whoa! It's like Thanos
in a sport coat.

512
00:19:26.774 --> 00:19:28.558
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

513
00:19:28.602 --> 00:19:30.212
-Yeah.
-I'm scared.

514
00:19:30.256 --> 00:19:33.128
Uh. can Ethan come out to play?

515
00:19:33.172 --> 00:19:34.347
[Ethan] It's okay.

516
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:35.652
-It's cool?
-Uh-hmm.

517
00:19:35.696 --> 00:19:37.045
Okay.

518
00:19:37.088 --> 00:19:39.178
-Hey.
-[Ethan] Thank you. Heegan.

519
00:19:39.221 --> 00:19:40.527
Welcome to my home.

520
00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:41.919
[Stephanie] Incredible.

521
00:19:41.963 --> 00:19:43.791
Enthralled you both
could make it.

522
00:19:44.748 --> 00:19:46.141
This is for you.

523
00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:47.751
Steph. thank you.

524
00:19:48.709 --> 00:19:51.015
Pinot. Hmm.

525
00:19:51.059 --> 00:19:53.888
Pete picked it out
just like our outfits.

526
00:19:53.931 --> 00:19:56.064
so if it sucks...

527
00:19:56.107 --> 00:19:57.935
I thought it'd compliment
the whole Renfield thing.

528
00:19:57.979 --> 00:19:59.546
you know. and really go
with your motif.

529
00:19:59.589 --> 00:20:02.462
That is so thoughtful. Pete.

530
00:20:02.505 --> 00:20:04.594
Though. Renfield
was an assistant.

531
00:20:04.638 --> 00:20:07.597
I was clearly a Baron.

532
00:20:07.641 --> 00:20:10.774
But I appreciate the sentiment.

533
00:20:10.818 --> 00:20:13.081
Please. do come in.

534
00:20:13.124 --> 00:20:14.952
Do come in.

535
00:20:16.345 --> 00:20:20.219
This dude
really is committed to this.

536
00:20:23.265 --> 00:20:26.007
[Ethan] Pete. would you mind
closing the door. please?

537
00:20:29.271 --> 00:20:32.274
[dramatic music playing]

538
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:37.714
[grunting]

539
00:20:50.466 --> 00:20:53.513
[door creaking]

540
00:20:58.909 --> 00:21:00.433
-Jackpot!
-It's cool?

541
00:21:00.476 --> 00:21:02.348
-I'd love to.
-Yeah. yeah. It's my pleasure.

542
00:21:02.391 --> 00:21:04.393
He might be single
for the right girl.

543
00:21:04.437 --> 00:21:07.875
And this is my game room.

544
00:21:07.918 --> 00:21:10.181
[Stephanie] Should have worn
my cleavage.

545
00:21:10.225 --> 00:21:11.618
Oh. shit.
I haven't seen that dude

546
00:21:11.661 --> 00:21:13.663
since Counting Crows broke up.

547
00:21:13.707 --> 00:21:15.099
Hey. Pete Brennan!
How are you. man?

548
00:21:15.143 --> 00:21:16.666
[Pete] Yeah. I'm doing good.

549
00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:19.539
Well. I'm. uh.
free next two months if...

550
00:21:19.582 --> 00:21:21.018
You know. come
to a guest set.

551
00:21:21.062 --> 00:21:22.498
they love to see you.
just pop in.

552
00:21:22.542 --> 00:21:23.630
Eight minutes?

553
00:21:23.673 --> 00:21:25.284
Uh. well. give it ten minutes.

554
00:21:25.327 --> 00:21:27.547
-Okay [indistinct]
-All right.

555
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:29.636
-Take care. Pete.
-Harry. you look great.

556
00:21:29.679 --> 00:21:30.854
You too. buddy.
Love you. man.

557
00:21:30.898 --> 00:21:32.943
Man. back at you. dude.

558
00:21:32.987 --> 00:21:35.119
[Stephanie] That went well.

559
00:21:36.512 --> 00:21:40.037
[Chuck] Hey.
what's up. monkey-tits?

560
00:21:40.081 --> 00:21:41.735
What's up. Chuck?

561
00:21:41.778 --> 00:21:44.346
[chuckle] Swing and a miss!

562
00:21:45.608 --> 00:21:46.740
What are you doing here?

563
00:21:46.783 --> 00:21:48.742
Checking out the new talent.

564
00:21:48.785 --> 00:21:50.483
When you're saying new talent.

565
00:21:50.526 --> 00:21:53.181
I hope you mean females

566
00:21:53.224 --> 00:21:54.791
and not the emo kid
who lives here.

567
00:21:54.835 --> 00:21:57.577
Hey. I know you may find
this tough to believe.

568
00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:00.928
but you are not the only
open miker on my roster.

569
00:22:00.971 --> 00:22:02.669
-Hey!
-Oh. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

570
00:22:02.712 --> 00:22:05.149
Easy. cockbreath. all right?
I'm working for you.

571
00:22:05.193 --> 00:22:06.716
Didn't you get my message?

572
00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.936
I got you the cover
of Middle Act Magazine.

573
00:22:08.979 --> 00:22:10.764
-Oh!
-Ho. ho. Hey!

574
00:22:10.807 --> 00:22:12.156
Now. shut your chicken skimmer

575
00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.332
and let's do another shot.

576
00:22:13.375 --> 00:22:14.985
Ain't got to tell me twice.

577
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:16.552
Who wants another shot?

578
00:22:16.596 --> 00:22:18.337
-Yeah. Always.
-Oh. yeah. No.

579
00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:20.904
I would absolutely love to.
except it looks like

580
00:22:20.948 --> 00:22:23.951
I'm designated driver
tonight again.

581
00:22:23.994 --> 00:22:26.388
Why are you even with this man?

582
00:22:26.432 --> 00:22:27.694
Two words.

583
00:22:27.737 --> 00:22:29.652
Baby arm.

584
00:22:29.696 --> 00:22:31.132
Any questions?

585
00:22:31.175 --> 00:22:32.568
Come on. Steph.
We all know that baby

586
00:22:32.612 --> 00:22:34.091
is gonna be asleep by 9:00.

587
00:22:34.135 --> 00:22:36.616
[laughter]

588
00:22:36.659 --> 00:22:38.661
Good point.
Chuck. line 'em up.

589
00:22:38.705 --> 00:22:41.011
Now. that's a fuckin'
team player. boys!

590
00:22:41.055 --> 00:22:42.491
All right. Round them up.

591
00:22:42.535 --> 00:22:44.014
-Here you go. kids.
-[Chuck] Let's go!

592
00:22:44.058 --> 00:22:46.147
All right. guys.
What are gonna we toast to?

593
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:47.627
Oh. apparently. we're toasting

594
00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:50.847
to Pete's cream-filled
flesh twinkie.

595
00:22:53.981 --> 00:22:57.201
I think that Ethan
should do the toast.

596
00:22:57.245 --> 00:22:58.942
I don't know.

597
00:22:58.986 --> 00:23:00.248
[all] Come on.

598
00:23:00.291 --> 00:23:02.903
Ethan. Ethan.

599
00:23:02.946 --> 00:23:07.211
[all] Ethan! Ethan!
Ethan! Ethan!

600
00:23:07.255 --> 00:23:08.256
Okay. Okay.

601
00:23:08.299 --> 00:23:10.171
Come on. burgundy boy.

602
00:23:14.001 --> 00:23:17.831
To a long life and a happy one.

603
00:23:17.874 --> 00:23:21.400
To a quick death
that escapes none.

604
00:23:21.443 --> 00:23:26.405
Drink to good spirits.
worthy amongst friends.

605
00:23:26.448 --> 00:23:28.407
Drink that you may live.

606
00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:30.452
and may you live till the end.

607
00:23:30.496 --> 00:23:33.542
And for those who cannot.

608
00:23:33.586 --> 00:23:35.196
it has often been said...

609
00:23:36.458 --> 00:23:38.286
may we meet in heaven

610
00:23:38.329 --> 00:23:40.636
before the devil knows
we're dead.

611
00:23:42.856 --> 00:23:45.206
I--I don't get it.

612
00:23:45.249 --> 00:23:47.382
That's 'cause you take your IQ
with a fuckin' tire gauge.

613
00:23:47.426 --> 00:23:49.558
[man] Oh. Somebody said it.
Holy shit!

614
00:23:49.602 --> 00:23:51.865
-Cheers. guys!
-[all] Cheers!

615
00:23:51.908 --> 00:23:55.651
[indistinct chatter]

616
00:23:58.306 --> 00:24:00.047
[Pete] Whoa.

617
00:24:01.875 --> 00:24:03.833
She's mesmerizing!

618
00:24:03.877 --> 00:24:06.009
She was mesmerizing.

619
00:24:06.053 --> 00:24:07.794
Where did you come from. dude?

620
00:24:07.837 --> 00:24:10.884
Damn. Yeah.

621
00:24:12.668 --> 00:24:14.104
You bang her?

622
00:24:15.758 --> 00:24:17.151
She was my mother.

623
00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.242
You bang her?

624
00:24:23.636 --> 00:24:25.594
Bangable.

625
00:24:25.638 --> 00:24:28.510
What filter did they use
to make her look old-timey?

626
00:24:28.554 --> 00:24:29.816
That's pretty cool.

627
00:24:29.859 --> 00:24:32.514
It's an original
Poussin. actually.

628
00:24:32.558 --> 00:24:35.561
Painted in 1621.

629
00:24:35.604 --> 00:24:38.694
The summer before she died.

630
00:24:38.738 --> 00:24:41.044
-Poussin?
-Poussin.

631
00:24:41.088 --> 00:24:42.611
[scoffs]

632
00:24:42.655 --> 00:24:45.179
I bet she got
a lot of Poussin.

633
00:24:46.485 --> 00:24:48.922
No. This is my only one.

634
00:24:48.965 --> 00:24:51.359
No. bruh.

635
00:24:51.402 --> 00:24:54.667
This is a Poussin palace.

636
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:58.018
No. it's my palace.
He simply painted one picture.

637
00:24:58.061 --> 00:24:59.846
He was a family friend.

638
00:25:01.848 --> 00:25:05.895
1621. a lot of people
died in 1621.

639
00:25:05.939 --> 00:25:07.288
Beheading.

640
00:25:09.725 --> 00:25:12.554
Seriously?

641
00:25:12.598 --> 00:25:14.425
It happens.

642
00:25:19.474 --> 00:25:23.696
Aha. Aha.

643
00:25:23.739 --> 00:25:27.395
"Let them eat cake!"

644
00:25:27.438 --> 00:25:28.701
Something like that.

645
00:25:28.744 --> 00:25:32.269
Yeah. "Off with their heads!

646
00:25:32.313 --> 00:25:37.927
Give me liberty or give me cake.

647
00:25:37.971 --> 00:25:41.583
Cake for them to eat

648
00:25:41.627 --> 00:25:44.891
without their heads.

649
00:25:44.934 --> 00:25:49.025
so they have no mouth
to eat it!"

650
00:25:50.157 --> 00:25:52.115
Even funnier the second time.

651
00:26:01.081 --> 00:26:03.953
No fucking way!

652
00:26:03.997 --> 00:26:05.215
Uh-hmm.

653
00:26:05.259 --> 00:26:07.435
You sleep in this thing?

654
00:26:07.478 --> 00:26:09.872
Well. before
blackout curtains. sure.

655
00:26:09.916 --> 00:26:13.267
It's mostly just for show now.

656
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:17.140
A few extracurricular
activities.

657
00:26:17.184 --> 00:26:18.794
Thank you.

658
00:26:18.838 --> 00:26:20.448
Thank you so much.

659
00:26:20.491 --> 00:26:23.843
Of course. Hmm.

660
00:26:24.887 --> 00:26:27.716
You were amazing.

661
00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.111
-You were incredible.
-No. My pleasure.

662
00:26:33.287 --> 00:26:36.769
I'm gonna take it
those aren't your aunts?

663
00:26:36.812 --> 00:26:38.292
-Oh.
-What?

664
00:26:38.335 --> 00:26:40.816
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. man. I'm good.

665
00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:42.252
-Okay.
-Unless you put something

666
00:26:42.296 --> 00:26:43.427
in this.
You put something?

667
00:26:43.471 --> 00:26:44.820
No. no.

668
00:26:44.864 --> 00:26:47.344
You want to make
this a Cosbypolitan?

669
00:26:47.388 --> 00:26:49.346
-No. Thank you.
-Thank you.

670
00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:52.132
I had heard you might need
an opener for this week.

671
00:26:52.175 --> 00:26:54.438
From who?

672
00:26:54.482 --> 00:26:57.137
-Chuck.
-Chuck?

673
00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.574
-Fuck Chuck!
-He may have mentioned it.

674
00:26:59.618 --> 00:27:03.099
And let me say.
if you take me.

675
00:27:03.143 --> 00:27:07.451
I will drive and I will pay
for every expense.

676
00:27:07.495 --> 00:27:11.499
-What?
-I'll pay for everything.

677
00:27:11.542 --> 00:27:13.632
-Booze?
-Yes.

678
00:27:13.675 --> 00:27:16.591
-Gas?
-Yes.

679
00:27:16.635 --> 00:27:18.680
Viagra?

680
00:27:18.724 --> 00:27:20.943
If you need it.

681
00:27:20.987 --> 00:27:22.989
Anal beads?

682
00:27:23.032 --> 00:27:24.555
I don't know
where to get those.

683
00:27:24.599 --> 00:27:26.645
but I'll give you cash.

684
00:27:26.688 --> 00:27:28.298
All right.

685
00:27:28.342 --> 00:27:31.650
How about this.
on top of all the expenses.

686
00:27:31.693 --> 00:27:34.914
you can also keep all the money
I will get paid for opening

687
00:27:34.957 --> 00:27:36.959
as well as an additional 3.000

688
00:27:37.003 --> 00:27:40.397
on top for the opportunity?

689
00:27:40.441 --> 00:27:42.399
What do you say?

690
00:27:42.443 --> 00:27:44.706
Why?

691
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:47.622
Money is fleeting. Pete.

692
00:27:47.666 --> 00:27:49.624
Comedy isn't.

693
00:27:49.668 --> 00:27:54.107
And I want to learn
from the best. you.

694
00:27:56.109 --> 00:27:58.198
Well. I'd be an asshole
if I said no.

695
00:27:58.241 --> 00:27:59.721
Yes.

696
00:27:59.765 --> 00:28:01.505
Oh. thank you.

697
00:28:01.549 --> 00:28:03.029
I am but your humble servant.

698
00:28:03.072 --> 00:28:05.248
Ha! Servant.

699
00:28:05.292 --> 00:28:07.686
Servant! You said it. Renfield.

700
00:28:07.729 --> 00:28:10.210
I was right.
that bottle of wine is on point.

701
00:28:10.253 --> 00:28:11.994
Touche.

702
00:28:12.038 --> 00:28:14.040
So. we're good?

703
00:28:14.083 --> 00:28:15.737
Yeah. we're good.

704
00:28:15.781 --> 00:28:18.218
-Wonderful.
-Let me tell you something.

705
00:28:19.349 --> 00:28:23.005
I'm not sucking your dick.

706
00:28:23.049 --> 00:28:24.528
and more importantly...

707
00:28:25.704 --> 00:28:27.618
you're not sucking my dick.

708
00:28:30.056 --> 00:28:32.754
Look. just--I don't--
just no dicks. okay?

709
00:28:32.798 --> 00:28:35.017
No dicks. okay?

710
00:28:35.061 --> 00:28:36.627
No touching tips.

711
00:28:36.671 --> 00:28:38.194
No. "Hey. show me yours.
I'll show you mine."

712
00:28:38.238 --> 00:28:42.372
It ain't fucking
summer camp. okay?

713
00:28:42.416 --> 00:28:44.113
Understood.

714
00:28:44.157 --> 00:28:46.725
To our dickless adventure.

715
00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:51.512
All right.

716
00:28:51.555 --> 00:28:53.383
Dude. you win.

717
00:28:53.427 --> 00:28:57.126
There's no way I would
ever agree to take him with me.

718
00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:59.476
Guy has a freaking coffin.

719
00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:03.132
I'm almost sure
that is mostly for show.

720
00:29:03.176 --> 00:29:04.743
How do you know that?

721
00:29:04.786 --> 00:29:07.920
Hmm. because
he told me with his words. Pete.

722
00:29:07.963 --> 00:29:10.792
You got to cut out
this jealousy bullshit.

723
00:29:10.836 --> 00:29:12.576
I'm not jealous.

724
00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:13.708
But you're still
my girlfriend. right.

725
00:29:13.752 --> 00:29:15.318
or did I miss that memo?

726
00:29:15.362 --> 00:29:17.494
-Girlfriend. Right.
-[Pete] Yeah. girlfriend.

727
00:29:17.538 --> 00:29:19.801
Hmm. more like pit stop
when you drift into town

728
00:29:19.845 --> 00:29:22.804
-every six weeks.
-Oh. Jesus Christ.

729
00:29:22.848 --> 00:29:26.286
-Come on.
-[Stephanie] No. You come on.

730
00:29:26.329 --> 00:29:27.940
Honey. you're always
on the road.

731
00:29:27.983 --> 00:29:29.593
which I understand.
but you barely even text me

732
00:29:29.637 --> 00:29:31.160
in between spells of inebriation

733
00:29:31.204 --> 00:29:32.727
and hangover.

734
00:29:32.771 --> 00:29:34.468
which is a very small window.
by the way.

735
00:29:34.511 --> 00:29:37.384
Okay. First of all.
like my thumbs get tired. okay?

736
00:29:37.427 --> 00:29:40.430
Second of all.
I lose battery power.

737
00:29:40.474 --> 00:29:42.606
And third of all.
that's just not true.

738
00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:44.521
It's abso-fucking-lutely true.

739
00:29:44.565 --> 00:29:46.045
Oh. and irrelevant.

740
00:29:46.088 --> 00:29:48.003
Ethan is my friend.
Period.

741
00:29:48.047 --> 00:29:50.789
He's a good guy and I want you
to get to know him.

742
00:29:50.832 --> 00:29:52.703
He's your friend?

743
00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:56.620
Why?

744
00:29:56.664 --> 00:29:58.187
He's like 12.

745
00:29:58.231 --> 00:29:59.798
Ew!

746
00:29:59.841 --> 00:30:01.756
Epstein much?

747
00:30:03.236 --> 00:30:04.803
[Stephanie] Okay.
Well. that 12-year-old

748
00:30:04.846 --> 00:30:06.282
is wise beyond his years

749
00:30:06.326 --> 00:30:07.849
and you could learn
a thing or two.

750
00:30:07.893 --> 00:30:11.374
Like what.
how to hang upside down?

751
00:30:11.418 --> 00:30:13.681
Stop being a titty-baby
and look in the mirror.

752
00:30:13.724 --> 00:30:16.336
-No.
Yes.

753
00:30:16.379 --> 00:30:18.077
-I don't wanna.
-[Stephanie] Look in the mirror.

754
00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:19.861
-[Pete] You can't make me.
-Look in the mirror. Pete.

755
00:30:19.905 --> 00:30:22.168
All right. I'll look.
I'll look.

756
00:30:22.211 --> 00:30:23.691
Jesus Christ.

757
00:30:23.734 --> 00:30:26.912
Ethan is you
when you first started.

758
00:30:26.955 --> 00:30:28.565
when you were hungry
and thirsty.

759
00:30:28.609 --> 00:30:31.830
and willing to sacrifice
anything for a laugh.

760
00:30:31.873 --> 00:30:33.788
Do you even remember that. Pete?

761
00:30:33.832 --> 00:30:35.834
Yeah.

762
00:30:35.877 --> 00:30:39.141
Because that "anything"
became me.

763
00:30:42.623 --> 00:30:43.842
I'm sorry.

764
00:30:45.191 --> 00:30:46.714
I don't know what happened
all these years.

765
00:30:46.757 --> 00:30:48.847
you know. just chasing a laugh.

766
00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:50.239
But I never ever lost--

767
00:30:50.283 --> 00:30:52.807
Lost sight of me. Yeah.

768
00:30:57.638 --> 00:31:00.206
How'd you know
I was gonna say that?

769
00:31:00.249 --> 00:31:01.337
[Stephanie] Because I know
you better

770
00:31:01.381 --> 00:31:03.383
than you know yourself.

771
00:31:03.426 --> 00:31:05.907
But. of course. you seem
to have forgotten that.

772
00:31:08.954 --> 00:31:10.433
No. I just--look.

773
00:31:10.477 --> 00:31:11.695
But just...

774
00:31:15.656 --> 00:31:20.356
you haven't been the same
since Charlie.

775
00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.228
But I promised you.
I would always be there

776
00:31:22.271 --> 00:31:25.318
for you and here I am.

777
00:31:25.361 --> 00:31:28.408
But it's pretty clear that...

778
00:31:28.451 --> 00:31:31.498
the old Pete isn't coming back.

779
00:31:31.541 --> 00:31:33.021
But that's okay.

780
00:31:33.065 --> 00:31:34.936
Maybe this is a chance
at a new beginning.

781
00:31:36.895 --> 00:31:39.158
You need this. Pete.

782
00:31:39.201 --> 00:31:40.724
We both do.

783
00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:47.035
Or maybe you just need someone
to keep tabs on me?

784
00:31:47.079 --> 00:31:49.429
Oh. my God.
Are you kidding me right now?

785
00:31:49.472 --> 00:31:50.996
-[Pete] What?
-You don't think I'm aware

786
00:31:51.039 --> 00:31:53.041
of the D-grade slags
that cling onto you

787
00:31:53.085 --> 00:31:56.566
in between truck stop towns
and dingy-ass dive bars.

788
00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:59.047
Hold on. D?

789
00:31:59.091 --> 00:32:01.963
D. like double D.

790
00:32:02.007 --> 00:32:04.835
Okay. What?
I can't help who talks to me.

791
00:32:04.879 --> 00:32:06.620
-What do you want from me?
-I don't know.

792
00:32:06.663 --> 00:32:08.187
But maybe I'll find the answer
in your phone.

793
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:09.971
Maybe if I peruse
through your text.

794
00:32:10.015 --> 00:32:12.147
I'm gonna find a bunch
of late-night conspicuous

795
00:32:12.191 --> 00:32:14.280

fan club.

796
00:32:14.323 --> 00:32:16.412
What's a belfie?

797
00:32:16.456 --> 00:32:18.545
It's a butt selfie. Come on.

798
00:32:18.588 --> 00:32:19.938
Get on it. grandpa.

799
00:32:19.981 --> 00:32:21.374
I don't know. I'm--

800
00:32:21.417 --> 00:32:23.245
That's besides the point. okay?

801
00:32:23.289 --> 00:32:25.769
My loyalty only goes so far.

802
00:32:27.075 --> 00:32:28.511
You know what?
Fine. Whatever.

803
00:32:28.555 --> 00:32:29.991
I'll take him. okay?

804
00:32:30.035 --> 00:32:31.079
I don't have time for this.

805
00:32:31.123 --> 00:32:32.646
Good.

806
00:32:33.995 --> 00:32:36.519

It's right there.

807
00:32:36.563 --> 00:32:37.912
-Knock yourself out.
-I will.

808
00:32:37.956 --> 00:32:39.566
-I have to pack.
-Okay.

809
00:32:39.609 --> 00:32:41.176
-Have fun.
-I will.

810
00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:42.308
-Go for it.
-Great.

811
00:32:42.351 --> 00:32:43.352
-Yeah.
-Fun times.

812
00:32:43.396 --> 00:32:45.006
-Enjoy yourself.
-Uh-hmm.

-Yeah. Thanks.

Sorry about heckling
y'all earlier.

888
00:36:29.274 --> 00:36:31.189
Thought maybe it should help.

889
00:36:31.232 --> 00:36:34.235
Guess what. it never helps.

890
00:36:34.279 --> 00:36:35.932
Well. let me buy you a drink.

891
00:36:35.976 --> 00:36:38.500
Guess what. that always helps.

892
00:36:38.544 --> 00:36:40.415
All right

893
00:36:40.459 --> 00:36:42.809
[speaking foreign language]
Please. Everybody.

894
00:36:42.852 --> 00:36:45.246
What did he say?

895
00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:46.508
Uh. I'm gonna be right back.

896
00:36:49.207 --> 00:36:51.644
Never say. "I'll be right back."

897
00:36:51.687 --> 00:36:53.994
I'm just going to splash
some water on my face.

898
00:36:54.037 --> 00:36:56.518
Uh. ladies' room is that way.

899
00:36:56.562 --> 00:36:59.391
We don't have one of
those non-gender ones.

900
00:36:59.434 --> 00:37:01.393
you'll just have to make do.

901
00:37:03.438 --> 00:37:06.615
Your young fella there
seems a bit touched.

902
00:37:06.659 --> 00:37:08.356
Where did you find him?

903
00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.663
He was a keynote speaker
at a flat-earth convention.

904
00:37:14.232 --> 00:37:15.842
-[laughs]
-Oh!

905
00:37:15.885 --> 00:37:17.322
You had us going there.

906
00:37:17.365 --> 00:37:20.412
Ah? Ah?

907
00:37:20.455 --> 00:37:22.631
Ain't that right?

908
00:37:22.675 --> 00:37:25.068
[laughs]

909
00:37:25.112 --> 00:37:27.897
Yeah. I'm gonna go check
on the young buck.

910
00:37:27.941 --> 00:37:30.073
You said the ladies' room
was that way?

911
00:37:30.117 --> 00:37:33.163
That. see.
he's the funny one for sure.

912
00:37:33.207 --> 00:37:36.123
-I try. I try.
-Don't get lost.

913
00:37:36.166 --> 00:37:38.343
Is that on your tab. Billy Ray?

914
00:37:38.386 --> 00:37:40.301
[Billy Ray] Hell no.
Separate bills.

915
00:37:40.345 --> 00:37:42.347
But they pay for both.

916
00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:50.311
What the fuck are you doing?

917
00:37:50.355 --> 00:37:51.878
[Ethan] It's just blood. Pete.

918
00:37:51.921 --> 00:37:54.141
Can you quit
the fucking vampire routine.

919
00:37:54.184 --> 00:37:57.187
It's not a routine.
It's a necessity.

920
00:37:57.231 --> 00:37:58.841
Don't worry.
I don't need any of yours.

921
00:37:58.885 --> 00:38:00.843
Okay. I may be
a little bit buzzed. okay?

922
00:38:00.887 --> 00:38:04.107
But I'm not a dickhead.
Look. look. look.

923
00:38:04.151 --> 00:38:05.761
If you're a vampire.
how come you have a reflection?

924
00:38:05.805 --> 00:38:07.807
Because that's a myth.

925
00:38:07.850 --> 00:38:09.809
Like garlic
or a stake through the heart.

926
00:38:09.852 --> 00:38:11.201
that would kill anybody.

927
00:38:11.245 --> 00:38:12.290
Well. how have I been outside
with you

928
00:38:12.333 --> 00:38:13.900
in the sun like three times?

929
00:38:13.943 --> 00:38:16.990
I just can't be in direct
sunlight for very long.

930
00:38:17.033 --> 00:38:20.254
Pete. I have a very rare
condition called Porphyria.

931
00:38:20.298 --> 00:38:22.430
It affects my hemoglobin
if I don't inject.

932
00:38:22.474 --> 00:38:24.345
-Okay. I'm done. Stop. Stop.
-Pete. listen to me.

933
00:38:24.389 --> 00:38:26.129
No. You listen to me. okay?

934
00:38:26.173 --> 00:38:28.349
I know I'm not one to give
life advice. all right?

935
00:38:28.393 --> 00:38:30.569
I drink too much.
I eat like shit.

936
00:38:30.612 --> 00:38:32.701
I haven't worn a condom
since 1992.

937
00:38:32.745 --> 00:38:33.963
But heroin--

938
00:38:34.007 --> 00:38:36.357
I told you. it's blood.

939
00:38:36.401 --> 00:38:39.012
I know people that I loved

940
00:38:39.055 --> 00:38:41.362
who died on that shit. man.

941
00:38:41.406 --> 00:38:43.669
Brilliant comedians.
And it crushed me.

942
00:38:43.712 --> 00:38:46.933
You think I wanna deal and watch
your open mike ass croak?

943
00:38:46.976 --> 00:38:48.891
And you think for goddamn sure

944
00:38:48.935 --> 00:38:51.851
I don't wanna call your parents
that you OD'd on my watch?

945
00:38:51.894 --> 00:38:54.375
You won't have to report
to anyone.

946
00:38:54.419 --> 00:38:56.203
I never knew my father.

947
00:38:56.246 --> 00:38:59.728
And as you've been told.
my mother was behead in 1621.

948
00:38:59.772 --> 00:39:03.515
Oh. my God.
Your generation is so weird.

949
00:39:03.558 --> 00:39:05.473
Look. I give you credit. okay?

950
00:39:05.517 --> 00:39:07.867
You didn't demand a separate
bathroom 'cause you "identify"

951
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:10.435
as a vampire. but come--

952
00:39:10.478 --> 00:39:12.741
give me a fuckin' break. bro.

953
00:39:24.492 --> 00:39:26.233
What the fuck?

954
00:39:26.276 --> 00:39:28.235
Don't worry.

955
00:39:28.278 --> 00:39:30.193
I would never bite you. Pete.

956
00:39:31.978 --> 00:39:33.545
I got to quit drinking.

957
00:39:35.198 --> 00:39:37.331
That's not a bad idea.

958
00:39:40.116 --> 00:39:41.422
Whoa.

959
00:39:41.466 --> 00:39:43.337
I'm not interrupting some kind

960
00:39:43.381 --> 00:39:45.557
of Brokeback Mountainmoment.
am I?

961
00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:48.516
[laughing]

962
00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:51.737
You mind while I unwind?

963
00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:54.566
It's that big.

964
00:39:54.609 --> 00:39:56.524
I got to lay off pills.

965
00:39:58.221 --> 00:39:59.832
I might eat him.

966
00:39:59.875 --> 00:40:00.920
[Billy Ray] What?

967
00:40:05.925 --> 00:40:07.317
Morning. morning. morning.

968
00:40:07.361 --> 00:40:09.363
Hello. hello. hello.
I'm Carrie.

969
00:40:09.407 --> 00:40:11.757
I'm the producer of
Minky &amp; Connie in the Morning.

970
00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.236
I'm guessing
by those droopy eyes

971
00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:14.629
you must be
our whacky comedians?

972
00:40:14.673 --> 00:40:16.414
Busted.

973
00:40:16.457 --> 00:40:18.154
You totally forgot
the Visine. bro.

974
00:40:18.198 --> 00:40:20.374
[chuckles] See? I can already
tell you're funny.

975
00:40:20.418 --> 00:40:23.464
Now. if I can just have you fill
out these forms. please.

976
00:40:23.508 --> 00:40:25.423
What's this?

977
00:40:25.466 --> 00:40:26.989
Just a little background info
with lead-ins for your skits.

978
00:40:27.033 --> 00:40:28.556
You don't have
to write the whole joke out.

979
00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:30.428
just an idea
of what you're gonna say.

980
00:40:30.471 --> 00:40:32.342
Think of it like doing panel
for a late night talk show.

981
00:40:32.386 --> 00:40:34.301
-Carrie. is it?
-Uh-hmm.

982
00:40:34.344 --> 00:40:36.303
-You're new here?
-Uh-uh.

983
00:40:36.346 --> 00:40:39.828
We find it's better
just to be spontaneous.

984
00:40:39.872 --> 00:40:41.482
Pete. is it?

985
00:40:41.526 --> 00:40:43.876
We find that.
because you're on a D-List tour.

986
00:40:43.919 --> 00:40:46.748
you D-List comedians
consider this a D-List station.

987
00:40:46.792 --> 00:40:48.794
Guess what. it's not.

988
00:40:48.837 --> 00:40:51.144
We stream nationally
online and satellite radio.

989
00:40:51.187 --> 00:40:54.495
I'm well-aware that organic
comedy generally works better.

990
00:40:54.539 --> 00:40:56.497
However. most comics
come in here hung over

991
00:40:56.541 --> 00:40:58.412
whining about why they have
to do radio at 6:00 a.m.

992
00:40:58.456 --> 00:41:00.153
when the show they're plugging
isn't until 9:00 p.m.

993
00:41:00.196 --> 00:41:02.503
And it's true. most people
listening this morning

994
00:41:02.547 --> 00:41:04.026
probably won't go tonight.

995
00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:05.767
But we have
such a loyal fan base.

996
00:41:05.811 --> 00:41:07.508
they might just follow you
on social media.

997
00:41:07.552 --> 00:41:09.684
Get your ten followers up.

998
00:41:09.728 --> 00:41:12.034
Or perhaps they just enjoy
watching clips of old cisgender

999
00:41:12.078 --> 00:41:13.514
white male wash-up comedians.

1000
00:41:13.558 --> 00:41:15.951
vagina-shaming hotel clerks.
Okay?

1001
00:41:17.083 --> 00:41:18.650
Who are you?

1002
00:41:19.781 --> 00:41:21.696
It was a joke.

1003
00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:23.872
Hmm. I saw.
So funny. I forgot to laugh.

1004
00:41:23.916 --> 00:41:25.918
Anyhoo. I can tell you that

1005
00:41:25.961 --> 00:41:28.137
last week's guests
were hilarious.

1006
00:41:28.181 --> 00:41:30.052
So. I highly suggest
you bring your "A-game" today.

1007
00:41:30.096 --> 00:41:31.271
Understood?

1008
00:41:31.314 --> 00:41:32.838
Okay. Good talks.

1009
00:41:32.881 --> 00:41:34.579
I'll give you a minute
to fill out your form.

1010
00:41:34.622 --> 00:41:36.537
and then I'll come back to bring
you guys into the studio.

1011
00:41:36.581 --> 00:41:38.408
Okay? Okay.

1012
00:41:38.452 --> 00:41:39.671
Done?

1013
00:41:41.237 --> 00:41:43.065
Why. thank you.

1014
00:41:44.937 --> 00:41:46.068
[chuckles]

1015
00:41:59.604 --> 00:42:01.562
What's a blue waffle?

1016
00:42:08.613 --> 00:42:10.092
All right. They'll be ready
for you after the break.

1017
00:42:10.136 --> 00:42:11.790
If you guys will just follow me.

1018
00:42:13.052 --> 00:42:15.097
Thank you.

1019
00:42:15.141 --> 00:42:18.318
Hmm. No. Uh-uh. Nope.

1020
00:42:20.233 --> 00:42:22.235
Ugh.

1021
00:42:22.278 --> 00:42:24.890
[Ethan] Seriously.
what makes it blue?

1022
00:42:27.806 --> 00:42:29.851
Okay. When that light goes off.
we're good to go.

1023
00:42:29.895 --> 00:42:33.855
Ready? In three. two. one.

1024
00:42:33.899 --> 00:42:35.509
-Good timing.
-Oh. thank you.

1025
00:42:35.553 --> 00:42:37.163
Not bad for a newbie. huh?

1026
00:42:37.206 --> 00:42:38.643
Your father owns the station.
doesn't he?

1027
00:42:38.686 --> 00:42:40.470
How's your hairline?

1028
00:42:45.301 --> 00:42:46.955
[man]
Remember when getting away...

1029
00:42:46.999 --> 00:42:48.740
[Minky] Hey. guys.
Take a seat. Give me a sec.

1030
00:42:48.783 --> 00:42:50.480
[man] ...the family
and hitting the road?

1031
00:42:50.524 --> 00:42:51.873
So. we're back in 30.
We're gonna do a quick wrap

1032
00:42:51.917 --> 00:42:53.571
then we'll bring you guys on.

1033
00:42:53.614 --> 00:42:56.008
take a few phone calls.
give away a few tickets.

1034
00:42:56.051 --> 00:42:59.011
You guys will be back
in bed before sunrise.

1035
00:42:59.054 --> 00:43:02.405
Oh. all right.
Oh. that shit was good.

1036
00:43:02.449 --> 00:43:04.190
Those are your cans right there.

1037
00:43:04.233 --> 00:43:05.844
Put them on and make sure
you get really close to the mic

1038
00:43:05.887 --> 00:43:07.367
like it's a big old
"you know what".

1039
00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:10.152
[man] [indistinct]

1040
00:43:10.196 --> 00:43:11.980
-[man] Hey. folks.
-[Minky] Hey. folks.

1041
00:43:12.024 --> 00:43:13.895
Welcome back to
Minky &amp; Connie in the Morning

1042
00:43:13.939 --> 00:43:16.594
where we put
the Big O back in KBLO.

1043
00:43:16.637 --> 00:43:18.857
[Connie] All right. Who knows
that better than you. Minky?

1044
00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:20.336
[Minky] Hey-oh.

1045
00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:22.208
It's 6:06 this dreary
Tuesday morning.

1046
00:43:22.251 --> 00:43:23.513
But here to bring some sunshine.

1047
00:43:23.557 --> 00:43:25.298
we're talking to the comics

1048
00:43:25.341 --> 00:43:27.169
who are gonna be performing
tonight at the Rusty Nail.

1049
00:43:27.213 --> 00:43:29.171
[Connie] Pete Brennan
and Ethan Barr.

1050
00:43:29.215 --> 00:43:31.870
-Hey-oh.
-Woo. woo. woo. woo. woo.

1051
00:43:31.913 --> 00:43:33.393
How are you boys
doing this morning?

1052
00:43:33.436 --> 00:43:35.177
Uh. peachy.

1053
00:43:35.221 --> 00:43:38.703
Just--yeah. we're not
as caffeinated as you guys.

1054
00:43:38.746 --> 00:43:40.487
You did cocaine.

1055
00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:42.576
[tape screeches]

1056
00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:43.664
That's hysterical!

1057
00:43:43.708 --> 00:43:45.274
[laughing] They got jokes.

1058
00:43:45.318 --> 00:43:46.841
-That is so funny.
-You said it. Connie.

1059
00:43:46.885 --> 00:43:48.713
Now. Pete.
it says here you're originally

1060
00:43:48.756 --> 00:43:50.845
from Pittsburg and have appeared
on The Tonight Show?

1061
00:43:50.889 --> 00:43:52.499
That's right. Yeah. I...

1062
00:43:52.542 --> 00:43:54.632
I loved that show
when Johnny Carson was the host.

1063
00:43:54.675 --> 00:43:56.155
He was the best.
then Dave Letterman.

1064
00:43:56.198 --> 00:43:57.635
I miss Dave. Uh.

1065
00:43:57.678 --> 00:43:59.288
have you seen
his new interview shows?

1066
00:43:59.332 --> 00:44:00.812
[Minky] I have it cued up
and I haven't had a chance

1067
00:44:00.855 --> 00:44:02.204
to watch it yet.
I'm still finishing up Ozark.

1068
00:44:02.248 --> 00:44:04.642
Shut up.
I just binged that last week.

1069
00:44:04.685 --> 00:44:06.078
Don't spoil it. Connie.

1070
00:44:06.121 --> 00:44:07.340
Well. I--hmm.

1071
00:44:07.383 --> 00:44:09.995
So Pete. what's your skit like?

1072
00:44:10.038 --> 00:44:12.475
Well. I do mix of character.
I do political...

1073
00:44:12.519 --> 00:44:14.347
It says--wait. wait.
It says here

1074
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:15.827
you have a really good joke
about you losing your luggage

1075
00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:17.611
on the way here?
What the hell is that about?

1076
00:44:17.655 --> 00:44:19.657
-Man. I hate when that happens!
-Doesn't everyone?

1077
00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:22.834
Especially Pete because.
y'all. he drove.

1078
00:44:22.877 --> 00:44:25.619
Oh. Pete.
I gotta hear that joke.

1079
00:44:25.663 --> 00:44:26.794
Do the joke.

1080
00:44:26.838 --> 00:44:28.100
Do it. Do the joke.

1081
00:44:28.143 --> 00:44:30.276
Um. you just did.

1082
00:44:30.319 --> 00:44:31.669
She told you the punchline.

1083
00:44:33.409 --> 00:44:34.846
Right.

1084
00:44:34.889 --> 00:44:36.108
Ethan.

1085
00:44:36.151 --> 00:44:37.631
I am loving this whole

1086
00:44:37.675 --> 00:44:39.981
"emo" thing you have going on.
Hmm.

1087
00:44:40.025 --> 00:44:43.985
Baby. I could just eat
that ass up.

1088
00:44:44.029 --> 00:44:46.901
-Well. I am a vampire.
-I know. right?

1089
00:44:46.945 --> 00:44:49.121
Especially with these late
hours. it sure feels that way.

1090
00:44:49.164 --> 00:44:50.949
I know. We should
just wrap this up

1091
00:44:50.992 --> 00:44:52.385
before the sun comes up. right?

1092
00:44:52.428 --> 00:44:54.300
Actually. that's a myth.

1093
00:44:54.343 --> 00:44:55.736
We can be on the sun just like--

1094
00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:57.346
Favorite vampire movie. I say

1095
00:44:57.390 --> 00:44:58.739
Dracula: Dead &amp; Loving It.

1096
00:44:58.783 --> 00:45:00.480
Ooh. All my nieces got me sucked

1097
00:45:00.523 --> 00:45:01.916
into the whole Twilight craze.

1098
00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:03.396
"Sucked" being
the operative word

1099
00:45:03.439 --> 00:45:04.919
as those films
certainly did suck.

1100
00:45:06.399 --> 00:45:07.705
He's a comedian now.

1101
00:45:07.748 --> 00:45:09.054
Look at that. Minky.

1102
00:45:09.097 --> 00:45:10.316
See? It's not so hard.

1103
00:45:10.359 --> 00:45:12.448
You can do it.
Good job.

1104
00:45:12.492 --> 00:45:14.886
So Ethan. back to us.

1105
00:45:14.929 --> 00:45:17.192
So. since you're part
of that whole undead family.

1106
00:45:17.236 --> 00:45:19.455
which you're so freakin' sexy.

1107
00:45:19.499 --> 00:45:22.676
what is your favorite
vampire movie. hmm?

1108
00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:24.286
Well. you see. the problem is.

1109
00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:27.637
they aren't usually
historically accurate.

1110
00:45:27.681 --> 00:45:29.596
-But I suppose Bladeis--
-Come on.

1111
00:45:29.639 --> 00:45:31.250
Interview with the Vampire.
they nailed it.

1112
00:45:31.293 --> 00:45:33.513
-Yeah.
-They didn't.

1113
00:45:33.556 --> 00:45:35.950
Uh. Tom Cruise
and Brad Pitt? Dream team!

1114
00:45:35.994 --> 00:45:37.212
And that little girl.
what was her name?

1115
00:45:37.256 --> 00:45:38.823
I don't know. She like

1116
00:45:38.866 --> 00:45:40.912
screwed Spiderman or something.
like. dirt. dust.

1117
00:45:40.955 --> 00:45:42.740
-Kirsten Durst.
-Ey. ey. ey. ey. ey.

1118
00:45:42.783 --> 00:45:44.306
You--look. you cheated. Minky.

1119
00:45:44.350 --> 00:45:46.265
It's Kirsten Dunst.

1120
00:45:46.308 --> 00:45:47.527
I was looking up something else.

1121
00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:48.963
Oh. now you're gonna lie?

1122
00:45:49.007 --> 00:45:50.182
You're gonna lie to the people.

1123
00:45:50.225 --> 00:45:51.836
Okay. If you think Minky lied.

1124
00:45:51.879 --> 00:45:53.794
I want you to tell us
on Twitter right now.

1125
00:45:53.838 --> 00:45:55.796
All right. Thank you so much.
Pete and Ethan.

1126
00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:57.189
I appreciate
y'all for being here.

1127
00:45:57.232 --> 00:45:58.712
Or as they should
call themselves.

1128
00:45:58.756 --> 00:46:01.019
the comedy duo
of A-bat and Costello.

1129
00:46:01.062 --> 00:46:03.717
[laughing] Good one. yeah.

1130
00:46:03.761 --> 00:46:05.501
Coming up after the break.

1131
00:46:05.545 --> 00:46:07.068
we're gonna open up
the phone lines

1132
00:46:07.112 --> 00:46:08.809
and we're gonna be talking
to the sexy girls

1133
00:46:08.853 --> 00:46:10.376
from the Rabbit Ranch
who are gonna be showing up

1134
00:46:10.419 --> 00:46:12.987
to test out some new
"adult products".

1135
00:46:13.031 --> 00:46:15.555
Ooh. my kind of talk show.

1136
00:46:15.598 --> 00:46:17.513
All right.
You don't wanna miss that.

1137
00:46:17.557 --> 00:46:20.342
And if anyone wants some
free tickets to tonight's show.

1138
00:46:20.386 --> 00:46:23.084
I want you to hashtag
Ethan is a Vampire.

1139
00:46:23.128 --> 00:46:24.956
Also. #MinkyLies.

1140
00:46:24.999 --> 00:46:27.306
[Minky] We'll be back in five.

1141
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:29.221
Oh.

1142
00:46:29.264 --> 00:46:31.527
That was great. guys. You're
the best segment we've ever had.

1143
00:46:31.571 --> 00:46:33.225
I really appreciate
you guys being here.

1144
00:46:33.268 --> 00:46:34.574
[Minky] You guys did
really well. Thank you so much

1145
00:46:34.617 --> 00:46:36.010
for stopping by.
That was wonderful work.

1146
00:46:36.054 --> 00:46:38.926
Yeah. I'm just so fucking
high right now.

1147
00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:41.929
Can someone punch me
in the face?

1148
00:46:41.973 --> 00:46:43.496
Just punch me square
in the face.

1149
00:46:43.539 --> 00:46:44.627
No. Pete. Why?

1150
00:46:44.671 --> 00:46:46.325
You wanna do a shot?

1151
00:46:46.368 --> 00:46:48.196
I gotta go to my chiropractor
this afternoon.

1152
00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:50.242
[Connie] You're such a square.

1153
00:46:50.285 --> 00:46:52.505
Fuck it. [sniffles]

1154
00:46:52.548 --> 00:46:54.942
All right. Come on in.
We're so excited to have you.

1155
00:46:54.986 --> 00:46:57.075
Just go with it
and be spontaneous.

1156
00:46:57.118 --> 00:46:59.120
We found it works
so much better that way. okay?

1157
00:46:59.164 --> 00:47:00.818
Okay.

1158
00:47:00.861 --> 00:47:02.167
[singer]
♪ When I'm entering the convo♪

1159
00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:03.168
[Minky] Hey. hey. hey.
Good morning.

1160
00:47:03.211 --> 00:47:04.952
How are you guys?

1161
00:47:04.996 --> 00:47:07.215
You sit over there [indistinct]

1162
00:47:07.259 --> 00:47:08.738
Does that girl
have a bag of dicks?

1163
00:47:08.782 --> 00:47:09.827
Uh-hmm.

1164
00:47:11.176 --> 00:47:12.742
That's my career.

1165
00:47:12.786 --> 00:47:14.701
My career has been following
a bag of dicks.

1166
00:47:14.744 --> 00:47:16.094
That's just where I'm at.

1167
00:47:17.791 --> 00:47:19.619
Wow.

1168
00:47:19.662 --> 00:47:21.490
That. um...

1169
00:47:21.534 --> 00:47:25.407
Ethan's a Vampire hashtag
has over a thousand retweets.

1170
00:47:25.451 --> 00:47:26.800
Huh.

1171
00:47:26.844 --> 00:47:28.671
You're trending in Area 51.

1172
00:47:28.715 --> 00:47:30.630
Embrace it.

1173
00:47:30.673 --> 00:47:32.066
How so?

1174
00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:33.633
I don't know.

1175
00:47:33.676 --> 00:47:36.375
I haven't quite
figured you out yet.

1176
00:47:36.418 --> 00:47:38.986
but you seem to be all-in
with this whole vampire thing.

1177
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:41.467
So. I think
you should just run with it.

1178
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:43.773
I am a vampire. Pete.

1179
00:47:43.817 --> 00:47:47.908
See? Now I believe
you believe that. which is good.

1180
00:47:47.952 --> 00:47:50.171
It takes comics years
to find their voice.

1181
00:47:50.215 --> 00:47:51.999
You did it in a few months.

1182
00:47:52.043 --> 00:47:53.522
[sighs]

1183
00:47:53.566 --> 00:47:55.916
I'm sorry.
I--I--I don't follow.

1184
00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:57.700
Look.

1185
00:47:57.744 --> 00:47:59.702
I know my place
in this business. okay?

1186
00:47:59.746 --> 00:48:01.356
I'm a cisgender

1187
00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:05.143
white male piece of shit. okay?

1188
00:48:05.186 --> 00:48:08.624
There's millions
of "mes" out there. okay?

1189
00:48:08.668 --> 00:48:10.191
It's a different ballgame today.

1190
00:48:10.235 --> 00:48:11.932
It's not just
about being funny anymore.

1191
00:48:11.976 --> 00:48:13.716
It's about how many
social media followers you have.

1192
00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.457
what box do you check

1193
00:48:15.501 --> 00:48:17.155
or about a gimmick.

1194
00:48:17.198 --> 00:48:20.332
You know. like that
thumb trick thing you do.

1195
00:48:20.375 --> 00:48:22.508
Oh. yes.

1196
00:48:22.551 --> 00:48:25.598
My Grandma Liz
taught me many. um.

1197
00:48:25.641 --> 00:48:27.643
"tricks" when I was younger.

1198
00:48:27.687 --> 00:48:31.430
So good. I would exploit
the shit out of that if I could.

1199
00:48:31.473 --> 00:48:34.041
Instead I was too busy
trying to be a comic's comic.

1200
00:48:35.434 --> 00:48:38.872
What's a "comic's comic?"

1201
00:48:38.916 --> 00:48:41.048
It's when all the comedians
stop talking in the back

1202
00:48:41.092 --> 00:48:42.658
of the room and they stop

1203
00:48:42.702 --> 00:48:45.923
to watch your set
and they study you.

1204
00:48:45.966 --> 00:48:47.881
It's the ultimate
form of flattery.

1205
00:48:47.925 --> 00:48:49.970
And how do you get that?

1206
00:48:50.014 --> 00:48:53.234
Truth. fearlessness. and time.

1207
00:48:53.278 --> 00:48:55.367
Time is overrated.

1208
00:48:55.410 --> 00:48:58.022
Sure. when you don't
appreciate it.

1209
00:48:58.065 --> 00:49:00.633
I did the same thing
when I was your age.

1210
00:49:00.676 --> 00:49:02.765
But time is precious.

1211
00:49:02.809 --> 00:49:05.159
You can never get it back.

1212
00:49:05.203 --> 00:49:06.944
I know.

1213
00:49:06.987 --> 00:49:09.990
I literally have all the time
in the world.

1214
00:49:10.034 --> 00:49:12.775
I spent 200 years
learning the harpsichord.

1215
00:49:12.819 --> 00:49:15.082
By the time I perfected it.

1216
00:49:15.126 --> 00:49:17.128
baroque music was obsolete.

1217
00:49:19.086 --> 00:49:22.176
Ha! Ha! See?
Now that's funny. dude.

1218
00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:23.786
Come on.

1219
00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:26.137
Why don't you do that
on stage tonight?

1220
00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:28.182
Look. when you go
up there tonight.

1221
00:49:28.226 --> 00:49:31.316
I want you to be you.

1222
00:49:31.359 --> 00:49:34.362
And if you suck. at least.
you'll be sucking as yourself.

1223
00:49:34.406 --> 00:49:36.016
Can you try--ah!

1224
00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:38.627
-Watch your feet!
-Son of a cock!

1225
00:49:38.671 --> 00:49:40.238
Hey. hand me that mop bucket
over there.

1226
00:49:40.281 --> 00:49:42.980
Some fuckwad puked
all over the damn place.

1227
00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:47.636
Thanks.

1228
00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:48.724
Got it.

1229
00:49:51.162 --> 00:49:52.859
Oh. God.

1230
00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:57.429
[scoffs]

1231
00:49:57.472 --> 00:49:59.344
Living the dream. dude.

1232
00:50:00.519 --> 00:50:01.955
This what you want. Ethan?

1233
00:50:05.567 --> 00:50:07.134
Absolutely.

1234
00:50:07.178 --> 00:50:10.181
And she's why
they call it beheading.

1235
00:50:10.224 --> 00:50:12.096
[laughter]

1236
00:50:12.139 --> 00:50:14.054
[bartender] Hey.

1237
00:50:14.098 --> 00:50:15.577
Hey.

1238
00:50:15.621 --> 00:50:18.145
Hey. you know this place
is haunted. right?

1239
00:50:18.189 --> 00:50:20.060
No. I'll just have a beer.

1240
00:50:20.104 --> 00:50:23.063
And it was actually
the entire fist.

1241
00:50:23.107 --> 00:50:26.458
[crowd] Boo!

1242
00:50:26.501 --> 00:50:28.851
Is it always this rowdy here?

1243
00:50:28.895 --> 00:50:30.636
Oh. God. no.
Not mostly.

1244
00:50:30.679 --> 00:50:32.203
But see. most of these folks.

1245
00:50:32.246 --> 00:50:33.900
they heard y'all on the radio
this morning.

1246
00:50:33.943 --> 00:50:35.380
So. uh. well.

1247
00:50:35.423 --> 00:50:37.512
they cannot see the undead.

1248
00:50:37.556 --> 00:50:39.819
No. I'm alive. okay?

1249
00:50:39.862 --> 00:50:41.473
I don't know
what the hell he is.

1250
00:50:41.516 --> 00:50:45.085
Hmm. may I take your pulse
to confirm that?

1251
00:50:45.129 --> 00:50:48.001
[crowd] Vampire! Vampire!

1252
00:50:48.045 --> 00:50:50.090
Vampire! Vampire!

1253
00:50:50.134 --> 00:50:52.136
Vampire! Vampire!

1254
00:50:52.179 --> 00:50:53.746
[Heckler 1] Vampire!

1255
00:50:53.789 --> 00:50:55.356
I'm sorry. what's that you say?

1256
00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:59.491
-[crowd] Vampire!
-Ah. yes.

1257
00:50:59.534 --> 00:51:01.754
vampires.

1258
00:51:01.797 --> 00:51:06.541
the immortal creatures
of both mystery and myth.

1259
00:51:15.289 --> 00:51:18.727
[cheers and applause]

1260
00:51:21.904 --> 00:51:23.776
Hey. bite me!

1261
00:51:23.819 --> 00:51:25.691
You aren't worthy of my powers.

1262
00:51:27.171 --> 00:51:28.911
Then suck my dick!

1263
00:51:28.955 --> 00:51:30.609
My friend.

1264
00:51:30.652 --> 00:51:32.741
there isn't enough blood
in that tiny thing

1265
00:51:32.785 --> 00:51:34.395
to keep me alive for an hour.

1266
00:51:34.439 --> 00:51:37.006
Say that to his face. ya pussy!

1267
00:51:37.050 --> 00:51:41.446
Technically.
I just did. but okay...

1268
00:51:41.489 --> 00:51:43.143
Jesus. fuck!

1269
00:51:44.318 --> 00:51:45.580
[bartender] Hell did he go?

1270
00:51:47.887 --> 00:51:49.541
-Shh!
-What the fuck?

1271
00:51:50.759 --> 00:51:53.327
[man groaning]

1272
00:51:55.721 --> 00:51:58.158
[woman screaming]

1273
00:52:02.467 --> 00:52:03.990
Is that mirrors?
Is that mirrors?

1274
00:52:04.033 --> 00:52:05.339
-You got mirrors in there?
-No!

1275
00:52:05.383 --> 00:52:07.820
That a special effect?

1276
00:52:07.863 --> 00:52:10.910
-[crowd] Whoa.
-[applause]

1277
00:52:14.653 --> 00:52:16.220
Ladies and gentlemen.

1278
00:52:16.263 --> 00:52:18.178
you have been delicious.

1279
00:52:18.222 --> 00:52:20.006
Thank you.

1280
00:52:20.049 --> 00:52:22.574
[cheers and applause]

1281
00:52:25.533 --> 00:52:27.970
Oh. if he broke that.
he's fucking paying for it.

1282
00:52:28.014 --> 00:52:29.668
Are you kidding me?

1283
00:52:29.711 --> 00:52:32.192
Oh. my God.

1284
00:52:32.236 --> 00:52:34.238
I don't even know
where to begin.

1285
00:52:34.281 --> 00:52:36.109
Do you believe me now?

1286
00:52:36.153 --> 00:52:37.502
How can I not?

1287
00:52:37.545 --> 00:52:39.199
I mean. the coffin is eccentric

1288
00:52:39.243 --> 00:52:40.983
but explainable. Okay?

1289
00:52:41.027 --> 00:52:42.811
The. the glowing eyes. contacts.

1290
00:52:42.855 --> 00:52:45.074
the teeth. fake.
the shooting blood.

1291
00:52:45.118 --> 00:52:48.295
it's an odd lifestyle choice
but hey. it's Vegas.

1292
00:52:48.339 --> 00:52:51.907
But dude. you turned
into a bat. man.

1293
00:52:51.951 --> 00:52:53.953
A fucking bat!

1294
00:52:53.996 --> 00:52:56.999
Pete. I never tried
to hide this from you.

1295
00:52:57.043 --> 00:52:59.132
I know but
I thought you were. like.

1296
00:52:59.176 --> 00:53:01.352
method acting or trying
to find your own identity.

1297
00:53:01.395 --> 00:53:02.831
Never in a million years
that I'd think

1298
00:53:02.875 --> 00:53:04.050
this stuff is actually real.

1299
00:53:04.093 --> 00:53:05.747
I'm sorry.

1300
00:53:05.791 --> 00:53:07.967
Perhaps I should've made
this clear before we left.

1301
00:53:08.010 --> 00:53:10.622
Wait. so do you--do you just
go around biting people?

1302
00:53:10.665 --> 00:53:13.494
No. God. how barbaric.

1303
00:53:13.538 --> 00:53:16.149
I had to give that up
in the '80s.

1304
00:53:16.193 --> 00:53:18.673
I almost bit Freddy Mercury.

1305
00:53:18.717 --> 00:53:21.023
-Dude. that's a close call.
-I know.

1306
00:53:21.067 --> 00:53:25.027
But I do still need
to feast off of fresh blood.

1307
00:53:25.071 --> 00:53:26.638
But now I just get it
from a friend of mine

1308
00:53:26.681 --> 00:53:29.293
who works at the hospital.

1309
00:53:29.336 --> 00:53:31.033
Okay.
Wait. start from the beginning.

1310
00:53:31.077 --> 00:53:33.297
Okay. I need to know
everything. details.

1311
00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:35.212
Gladly.

1312
00:53:35.255 --> 00:53:36.996
Well. for starters.

1313
00:53:37.039 --> 00:53:40.782
my grandmother was the infamous
Elizabeth Bathory.

1314
00:53:40.826 --> 00:53:42.741
a Countess who believed

1315
00:53:42.784 --> 00:53:44.743
she could retain her youth
by drinking

1316
00:53:44.786 --> 00:53:47.441
and bathing in the blood
of young girls.

1317
00:53:47.485 --> 00:53:50.009
You see. at the time. the life
expectancy...

1318
00:53:50.052 --> 00:53:52.272
All clear. Everyone's gone

1319
00:53:52.316 --> 00:53:55.275
except for a. uh. couple
of chicks who wanna meet you.

1320
00:53:55.319 --> 00:53:56.450
Are they hot?

1321
00:53:56.494 --> 00:53:58.496
Ridiculously hot.

1322
00:53:58.539 --> 00:54:00.280
but not you.

1323
00:54:00.324 --> 00:54:01.455
Vamp.

1324
00:54:02.978 --> 00:54:05.024
I don't even care
about chicks right now. dude.

1325
00:54:05.067 --> 00:54:06.808
He just turned to a bat.
Did you see that shit?

1326
00:54:06.852 --> 00:54:08.854
Yeah. it's fine.
It's no Jeff Dunham.

1327
00:54:08.897 --> 00:54:10.508
And I got bats in the attic.

1328
00:54:13.598 --> 00:54:15.121
Have you seen Jeff Dunham?

1329
00:54:15.164 --> 00:54:17.341
His act is phenomenal.

1330
00:54:17.384 --> 00:54:19.081
Dude. I love Dunham.

1331
00:54:19.125 --> 00:54:20.648
But he didn't turn to a bat.

1332
00:54:20.692 --> 00:54:23.042
Dunham doesn't have a bat.

1333
00:54:23.085 --> 00:54:25.218
May I present to you

1334
00:54:25.262 --> 00:54:27.960
the exquisite Ms. Scarlett Drake

1335
00:54:28.003 --> 00:54:30.658
and Madame Darah.

1336
00:54:30.702 --> 00:54:33.966
If you'll excuse me.
I have to go mop up some puke.

1337
00:54:34.009 --> 00:54:35.359
Hi.

1338
00:54:35.402 --> 00:54:38.797
-Hey.
-Hi.

1339
00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:40.973
You were semi-funny.

1340
00:54:41.016 --> 00:54:42.801
You don't need to curse so much.

1341
00:54:42.844 --> 00:54:44.150
Appreciate the tip.

1342
00:54:45.369 --> 00:54:47.196
Pleasure to make
your acquaintances.

1343
00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:50.722
Ethan. you look
exactly the same.

1344
00:54:50.765 --> 00:54:53.725
I'm sorry. have we met?

1345
00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:57.076
-So--
-No.

1346
00:54:57.119 --> 00:54:59.296
Okay.

1347
00:54:59.339 --> 00:55:01.123
I'll just let you kids
get reacquainted

1348
00:55:01.167 --> 00:55:03.430
and I'm going to light
myself on fire.

1349
00:55:03.474 --> 00:55:05.519
I'll bring the matches.

1350
00:55:07.521 --> 00:55:09.610
Does this ring a bell?

1351
00:55:09.654 --> 00:55:12.483
[moaning]

1352
00:55:14.049 --> 00:55:15.964
Prague.

1353
00:55:16.008 --> 00:55:17.314
Chantel.

1354
00:55:17.357 --> 00:55:18.445
You were the model

1355
00:55:18.489 --> 00:55:20.491
for the Goddess Victoria statue.

1356
00:55:22.188 --> 00:55:23.755
Oh. my goodness.

1357
00:55:28.194 --> 00:55:31.153
How could I ever forget that?

1358
00:55:31.197 --> 00:55:32.503
I don't know.

1359
00:55:32.546 --> 00:55:34.592
I am enthralled
to see you again.

1360
00:55:35.854 --> 00:55:37.508
And I am loving your new name.

1361
00:55:39.205 --> 00:55:41.033
What are you doing here?

1362
00:55:42.817 --> 00:55:44.253
You see this shit?

1363
00:55:44.297 --> 00:55:45.907
I'm the headliner.

1364
00:55:45.951 --> 00:55:47.605
What's he got that I don't got?

1365
00:55:47.648 --> 00:55:49.781
Two women. apparently.

1366
00:55:50.999 --> 00:55:53.175
You trying to make it three?

1367
00:55:53.219 --> 00:55:54.655
Maybe.

1368
00:55:54.699 --> 00:55:56.135
Okay.

1369
00:55:57.789 --> 00:56:00.400
I podcast.
I'm a social media influencer.

1370
00:56:00.444 --> 00:56:02.402
I dabble in fashion.

1371
00:56:02.446 --> 00:56:04.535
Hot. [chuckles]

1372
00:56:04.578 --> 00:56:06.493
[laughs]

1373
00:56:06.537 --> 00:56:07.886
What's that smell?

1374
00:56:07.929 --> 00:56:10.454
Oh. perfect timing!

1375
00:56:10.497 --> 00:56:13.631
You know what?
We should take a group photo.

1376
00:56:13.674 --> 00:56:15.589
-Yes.
-Do you mind?

1377
00:56:17.417 --> 00:56:18.766
Sure.

1378
00:56:18.810 --> 00:56:20.855
Ladies.

1379
00:56:20.899 --> 00:56:22.901
Okay.

1380
00:56:22.944 --> 00:56:26.861
Closer. closer. work it.

1381
00:56:26.905 --> 00:56:29.298
You got to hit them angle.

1382
00:56:29.342 --> 00:56:32.171
Okay. Ready? And...

1383
00:56:39.134 --> 00:56:40.788
see you at the hotel. Ethan.

1384
00:56:40.832 --> 00:56:42.616
And. uh. I'll try to cut out

1385
00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:45.227
the fucking swear words
out of my fucking act.

1386
00:56:48.709 --> 00:56:50.842
He turned into a bat.

1387
00:56:50.885 --> 00:56:52.539
an actual bat.

1388
00:56:52.583 --> 00:56:54.411
I'm losing my freaking mind.

1389
00:56:54.454 --> 00:56:56.761
Between the early 1600s
mommy issues

1390
00:56:56.804 --> 00:56:59.198
and that coffin thing.
I mean. I've had my suspicions.

1391
00:56:59.241 --> 00:57:00.852
What?

1392
00:57:00.895 --> 00:57:02.549
And you never said anything?

1393
00:57:02.593 --> 00:57:04.377
Do you have any idea
how crazy that sounds?

1394
00:57:04.421 --> 00:57:06.205
I know. but at least you could
have told me something.

1395
00:57:06.248 --> 00:57:07.641
Now. this whole
thing's gonna blow up.

1396
00:57:07.685 --> 00:57:08.860
It's gonna be a shit show

1397
00:57:08.903 --> 00:57:10.688
and I don't know where I'm at.

1398
00:57:10.731 --> 00:57:13.299
Whoa. I wasn't aware
I was your vampire riddler.

1399
00:57:13.342 --> 00:57:15.432
-Okay.
-Vampire.
