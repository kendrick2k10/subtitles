He'll be home tomorrow.

183
00:10:44.931 --> 00:10:47.241
- So you're alone with Tammy?

184
00:10:47.241 --> 00:10:49.827
- Yeah. Tammy and Aunt Pam
are out back doing yoga.

185
00:10:49.827 --> 00:10:50.724
I can go get them.

186
00:10:50.724 --> 00:10:51.862
- Nope. don't.

187
00:10:51.862 --> 00:10:53.724
Just go get your bag.

188
00:10:53.724 --> 00:10:55.103
I have a lot of surprises

189
00:10:55.103 --> 00:10:56.068
planned for you this
weekend. mister.

190
00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:58.758
- Okay. um. you
wanna see my room?

191
00:10:58.758 --> 00:10:59.206
- I shouldn't.

192
00:11:00.758 --> 00:11:02.206
- It's cool. they won't mind.

193
00:11:02.206 --> 00:11:03.068
Come on.

194
00:11:04.413 --> 00:11:05.275
Come on.

195
00:11:10.379 --> 00:11:11.206
- I'm proud of you. sis.

196
00:11:12.689 --> 00:11:13.310
The whole family is.

197
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:14.000
- Thank you.

198
00:11:15.793 --> 00:11:17.137
You know it doesn't
even feel really yet.

199
00:11:18.275 --> 00:11:19.413
- It will.

200
00:11:19.413 --> 00:11:21.241
And when it does.

201
00:11:21.241 --> 00:11:22.448
I'm here to negotiate
your new contract.

202
00:11:22.448 --> 00:11:23.379
- Thank you.

203
00:11:23.379 --> 00:11:25.241
I'm just happy you're here.

204
00:11:25.241 --> 00:11:28.241
Sometimes I feel like the
third wheel around this place.

205
00:11:28.241 --> 00:11:30.689
- I thought Mr. Right
treated you like gold.

206
00:11:30.689 --> 00:11:32.000
- No. it is not that.

207
00:11:36.931 --> 00:11:37.931
It's Deidra.

208
00:11:39.034 --> 00:11:41.137
She haunts this place.

209
00:11:42.758 --> 00:11:45.000
and if I even mention her.
Charles completely shuts down.

210
00:11:46.448 --> 00:11:49.000
[tense music]

211
00:12:06.517 --> 00:12:07.344
- What do you think?

212
00:12:08.965 --> 00:12:10.000
- I love it.

213
00:12:11.758 --> 00:12:13.379
- Um. you know what?

214
00:12:13.379 --> 00:12:17.896
I think we should go to
someplace fancy for dinner.

215
00:12:17.896 --> 00:12:19.896
Why don't you grab a jacket.

216
00:12:19.896 --> 00:12:22.310
an extra outfit.
and something nice.

217
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:23.172
You think you can do that?

218
00:12:24.379 --> 00:12:26.000
- Mom. this is me
you're talking to.

219
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.310
- Okay then.

220
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.827
Go and uh. get
something really nice.

221
00:12:30.827 --> 00:12:33.448
No basketball jerseys.

222
00:12:33.448 --> 00:12:34.310
- Okay.

223
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:36.827
- Take your time.

224
00:12:36.827 --> 00:12:39.172
[tense music]

225
00:12:43.758 --> 00:12:44.862
- What do you know about her?

226
00:12:44.862 --> 00:12:47.448
- Uh. not much.

227
00:12:47.448 --> 00:12:49.206
Just that when Charles
filed for divorce.

228
00:12:50.482 --> 00:12:51.862
she took it really hard

229
00:12:51.862 --> 00:12:53.000
and disappeared when
Jay was younger.

230
00:12:55.758 --> 00:12:56.206
- [Pam] She disappeared?

231
00:12:57.827 --> 00:12:59.310
- [Tammy] I guess.

232
00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:02.241
But she is back now and
she appears to be stable

233
00:13:03.896 --> 00:13:06.448
and she's ready to be a mom
again. so I'm happy for her.

234
00:13:06.448 --> 00:13:08.517
Truly. I am. because
when she's good.

235
00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:10.413
that means that Jay's good.

236
00:13:14.344 --> 00:13:17.034
- But aren't you curious
about what happened?

237
00:13:17.034 --> 00:13:18.275
- Nah.

238
00:13:18.275 --> 00:13:20.931
I have to respect
that. you know?

239
00:13:20.931 --> 00:13:22.034
Let the past be the past.

240
00:13:23.172 --> 00:13:24.517
- [Pam] What about you?

241
00:13:24.517 --> 00:13:25.379
- [Tammy] What about me?

242
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:27.034
- [Pam] As long as
Jay's under this roof.

243
00:13:27.034 --> 00:13:28.413
Deidre's gonna be coming around.

244
00:13:30.275 --> 00:13:31.241
You need to know what
you're up against.

245
00:13:32.827 --> 00:13:34.206
- What does that
mean. "Up against?"

246
00:13:35.448 --> 00:13:37.275
- If I was her.

247
00:13:37.275 --> 00:13:38.448
I'd wanna know everything
about the woman around my kid.

248
00:13:38.448 --> 00:13:41.241
Especially if she's
about to become

249
00:13:41.241 --> 00:13:42.931
the biggest star in the world.

250
00:13:42.931 --> 00:13:45.310
[tense music]

251
00:14:00.586 --> 00:14:01.448
- Mama.

252
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:06.448
What are you doing
in dad's room?

253
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.310
- I was looking
for the restroom.

254
00:14:10.413 --> 00:14:11.586
- Oh. okay.

255
00:14:11.586 --> 00:14:12.275
Come on. let's go.

256
00:14:14.655 --> 00:14:17.000
- You know.

257
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.172
I just want Deidra to respect
me and the way I care for Jay.

258
00:14:20.172 --> 00:14:21.413
like I respect her.

259
00:14:21.413 --> 00:14:24.448
Besides. I wanna have
kids of my own one day.

260
00:14:24.448 --> 00:14:26.620
- Well. if she keeps
disrespecting my sister.

261
00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:29.517
I will show her how
real of a sister I am.

262
00:14:29.517 --> 00:14:30.965
- Ooh.

263
00:14:30.965 --> 00:14:32.448
- I'll stomp a hole
in her real quick.

264
00:14:32.448 --> 00:14:33.620
- What?

265
00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.448
- I'll knock her teeth out.
Don't get me started. Uhn-uh

266
00:14:37.413 --> 00:14:38.275
- T.

267
00:14:42.448 --> 00:14:46.586
- Uh. okay. so look.
I told Jay that I.

268
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:48.620
I could have stayed in the car.

269
00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:49.413
If I overstepped.

270
00:14:49.413 --> 00:14:50.344
- Oh no. please. Deidre.

271
00:14:50.344 --> 00:14:51.448
Don't be silly. we're-

272
00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.000
- Thank you for allowing me

273
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.275
to take my child
for the weekend.

274
00:14:57.413 --> 00:14:58.310
Um. you know what?

275
00:14:59.448 --> 00:15:02.034
I wanna apologize
about the other day.

276
00:15:02.034 --> 00:15:04.965
I'm truly grateful

277
00:15:04.965 --> 00:15:06.517
for everything that
you've done for my child.

278
00:15:08.724 --> 00:15:10.655
Is there any way that we
could just. I don't know.

279
00:15:12.482 --> 00:15:13.448
Can we start over?

280
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:17.172
- I'd like that.

281
00:15:18.172 --> 00:15:19.655
- Cool. how about tonight?

282
00:15:21.344 --> 00:15:22.551
- Tonight?

283
00:15:22.551 --> 00:15:23.482
Um...

284
00:15:25.724 --> 00:15:26.482
- Yeah. my liquor cabinet.
it stays open pretty late.

285
00:15:28.413 --> 00:15:29.655
- Tonight may not
work. only because-

286
00:15:31.379 --> 00:15:32.551
- Oh. I get it. that's right.

287
00:15:32.551 --> 00:15:34.482
You probably have a bunch
of text messages to read.

288
00:15:34.482 --> 00:15:35.586
It's okay. it's cool.

289
00:15:37.034 --> 00:15:38.103
Come on baby. let's go.

290
00:15:38.103 --> 00:15:40.689
- Wait.
[ominous music]

291
00:15:40.689 --> 00:15:42.655
How late does your
liquor cabinet stay open?

292
00:15:44.482 --> 00:15:46.655
[tense music]

293
00:16:12.206 --> 00:16:13.275
- It's not much.

294
00:16:15.103 --> 00:16:16.517
but um. Jay has his own room

295
00:16:18.068 --> 00:16:19.344
and it's in a good
school district.

296
00:16:21.758 --> 00:16:23.241
- Um. I think it's great.

297
00:16:27.068 --> 00:16:28.275
- Let's do this.

298
00:16:30.379 --> 00:16:33.068
- Let's.

299
00:16:33.068 --> 00:16:34.758
- So how did you meet Charles?

300
00:16:34.758 --> 00:16:35.724
- Uh. my sister. Pam.

301
00:16:35.724 --> 00:16:36.655
- Pam.

302
00:16:37.724 --> 00:16:39.793
Cute.

303
00:16:39.793 --> 00:16:42.275
- Yeah. it's actually
a really funny story.

304
00:16:42.275 --> 00:16:42.620
So they were-
- A toast.

305
00:16:45.241 --> 00:16:45.724
- Okay.

306
00:16:47.379 --> 00:16:49.068
What are we toasting to?

307
00:16:49.068 --> 00:16:50.448
- You. silly.

308
00:16:51.413 --> 00:16:53.724
Your song. it's amazing.

309
00:16:55.655 --> 00:16:57.275
It's the prettiest song
that I've ever heard.

310
00:16:58.379 --> 00:16:59.241
- Thank you. Deidra.

311
00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.344
- I almost feel like I
have a connection to it.

312
00:17:03.482 --> 00:17:05.482
- Hmm.

313
00:17:05.482 --> 00:17:06.827
No. it's funny you say that

314
00:17:06.827 --> 00:17:09.620
because I felt the same
exact way when I heard it.

315
00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:11.137
- You heard it?

316
00:17:11.137 --> 00:17:12.620
- Yeah. the demo.

317
00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:15.172
Charles had written
it years ago.

318
00:17:15.172 --> 00:17:16.517
and when I heard this song.

319
00:17:18.344 --> 00:17:19.655
I just knew I had to sing it.

320
00:17:21.344 --> 00:17:23.206
- So he never released it?

321
00:17:23.206 --> 00:17:26.068
- Uh-uh. he said he could never
find the right voice for it.

322
00:17:26.068 --> 00:17:26.551
till now.

323
00:17:30.137 --> 00:17:32.344
- What exactly did
Charles tell you about me?

324
00:17:34.241 --> 00:17:36.344
- What does anybody ever
tell anyone about their ex?

325
00:17:36.344 --> 00:17:38.172
- Fair enough.
- Mm.

326
00:17:38.172 --> 00:17:40.172
[both chuckling]

327
00:17:40.172 --> 00:17:44.655
- Well. we met when I was
in my second year in college

328
00:17:44.655 --> 00:17:47.448
and he had just had
this serious breakup

329
00:17:47.448 --> 00:17:50.517
with Jessica Dawson.

330
00:17:52.482 --> 00:17:53.482
- Jessica Dawson.

331
00:17:55.655 --> 00:17:58.241
- By that look. you've
heard that name before.

332
00:17:59.655 --> 00:18:00.896
She really broke his heart.

333
00:18:00.896 --> 00:18:02.586
But her loss was my gain. right?

334
00:18:04.241 --> 00:18:07.310
And I was in school
for computer graphics.

335
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:08.586
but he saw right through.

336
00:18:09.275 --> 00:18:10.689
He knew I wanted to make music.

337
00:18:10.689 --> 00:18:12.206
- So you sing.

338
00:18:12.206 --> 00:18:12.758
- Dabbled.

339
00:18:15.137 --> 00:18:18.551
You know Charles. he makes
you feel like a star.

340
00:18:18.551 --> 00:18:20.620
- Mm.

341
00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:24.241
- He used to keep his uh.
his songs in these journals.

342
00:18:24.241 --> 00:18:25.413
- Yeah. he still does that.

343
00:18:26.517 --> 00:18:28.724
- And we would go to the studio

344
00:18:28.724 --> 00:18:33.241
and we would record
these amazing love songs.

345
00:18:33.241 --> 00:18:36.758
But then it led to more love
making than making music.

346
00:18:38.862 --> 00:18:40.620
I think sex inspires him.

347
00:18:46.206 --> 00:18:47.793
And then Jay was born and uh.

348
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.689
there was no more
time for music.

349
00:18:52.206 --> 00:18:53.862
At least that's what he told me.

350
00:18:56.517 --> 00:18:57.689
- So is that why you stopped?

351
00:18:59.517 --> 00:19:00.448
- We both did.

352
00:19:02.379 --> 00:19:05.379
We got married and we tried
to make the family thing work.

353
00:19:05.379 --> 00:19:08.793
He went back to work at a
old manufacturing plant.

354
00:19:08.793 --> 00:19:11.379
I went back to school
and we really tried.

355
00:19:11.379 --> 00:19:15.620
and we were a family.
until we weren't.

356
00:19:19.482 --> 00:19:19.758
He didn't tell you that. did he?

357
00:19:20.965 --> 00:19:21.931
- Uh. no.

358
00:19:24.206 --> 00:19:27.482
- Just that I'm a crazy
mama that abandoned her kid.

359
00:19:28.586 --> 00:19:30.793
- No. Deidre. he never said any-

360
00:19:30.793 --> 00:19:32.793
- I had so much love
for him. for our family.

361
00:19:33.689 --> 00:19:34.758
until he got arrested.

362
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:37.620
That was the
beginning of the end.

363
00:19:39.275 --> 00:19:39.793
- Arrested?

364
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:43.655
- I've said too much.

365
00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.482
- No. you haven't said enough.

366
00:19:51.275 --> 00:19:52.655
What was he arrested for?

367
00:19:53.793 --> 00:19:56.620
- Whatever happened
with us is in the past.

368
00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:57.931
He's with you now.

369
00:19:57.931 --> 00:19:59.793
- Yeah. but he never
told me any of this.

370
00:20:00.965 --> 00:20:03.275
- I'm not gonna start any more
trouble than I already have.

371
00:20:03.275 --> 00:20:04.931
He's found his way
back to his music.

372
00:20:06.586 --> 00:20:07.724
He's happy.

373
00:20:09.275 --> 00:20:09.931
You're happy.

374
00:20:11.793 --> 00:20:14.724
[melancholy music]

375
00:20:31.793 --> 00:20:32.620
And Jay's happy.

376
00:20:35.965 --> 00:20:38.448
I had a lawyer draw those
up and I signed them.

377
00:20:40.793 --> 00:20:42.827
I realized that there was
no upside for a waitress

378
00:20:42.827 --> 00:20:45.793
up against a successful
music producer in court.

379
00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:49.482
Take it.

380
00:20:53.655 --> 00:20:56.793
Besides. a custody
battle is no way to start

381
00:20:56.793 --> 00:20:58.551
a healthy co-parenting
relationship.

382
00:21:01.517 --> 00:21:03.344
- Wow. Deidra.

383
00:21:03.344 --> 00:21:03.793
Thank you.

384
00:21:06.655 --> 00:21:07.689
- This was fun.

385
00:21:08.827 --> 00:21:09.655
- It was.

386
00:21:09.655 --> 00:21:10.517
We should do it again.

387
00:21:11.896 --> 00:21:14.896
- Oh. by tomorrow.
you will be so famous

388
00:21:14.896 --> 00:21:17.034
you won't remember that
cheap wine I served you.

389
00:21:17.034 --> 00:21:19.517
- Oh. from me. your
lips to God's ears.

390
00:21:20.827 --> 00:21:22.517
And that wine was not
that cheap. Deidra.

391
00:21:24.482 --> 00:21:27.379
[dog barking]

392
00:21:27.379 --> 00:21:29.517
- That's just Renegade.
the neighbors dog.

393
00:21:30.413 --> 00:21:31.000
It's. he's harmless.

394
00:21:32.724 --> 00:21:33.655
- He don't sound that harmless.

395
00:21:33.655 --> 00:21:34.689
- You get used to it.

396
00:21:36.689 --> 00:21:38.000
[phone beeping]

397
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:38.724
Oh.

398
00:21:41.034 --> 00:21:42.724
[Deidra giggling]

399
00:21:42.724 --> 00:21:45.034
- And what has got
you smiling so hard?

400
00:21:45.034 --> 00:21:46.862
- It's not a what. it's a who.

401
00:21:48.275 --> 00:21:49.689
- Oh.

402
00:21:49.689 --> 00:21:50.517
Who?

403
00:21:50.517 --> 00:21:52.344
- Some guy.

404
00:21:52.344 --> 00:21:53.896
He uh. wants me to
send him a naughty pic.

405
00:21:55.586 --> 00:21:56.724
- Ooh. do you like him?

406
00:21:56.724 --> 00:21:58.620
- Yeah. maybe. I don't know.

407
00:22:00.413 --> 00:22:01.344
- Hey. do it. okay?

408
00:22:01.344 --> 00:22:02.517
You only live once.

409
00:22:02.517 --> 00:22:04.413
What. is he cute?

410
00:22:04.413 --> 00:22:05.931
- You'll see him soon enough.

411
00:22:07.068 --> 00:22:07.965
- Okay.

412
00:22:09.724 --> 00:22:11.827
Well um. I should get going.

413
00:22:11.827 --> 00:22:13.931
but I'm really glad we
got the chance to do this.

414
00:22:13.931 --> 00:22:14.758
- Likewise.

415
00:22:16.068 --> 00:22:19.965
- Thank you. Deidra.

416
00:22:19.965 --> 00:22:22.000
- You. uh. tell Charles
to stay outta trouble.

417
00:22:24.034 --> 00:22:26.758
[melancholy music]

418
00:22:35.758 --> 00:22:37.965
[lively music]

419
00:22:58.758 --> 00:22:59.034
- Tammy.

420
00:23:00.965 --> 00:23:02.517
Tammy. why aren't you ready?

421
00:23:02.517 --> 00:23:04.413
We have a meeting with
Satellite Radio at 11 o'clock.

422
00:23:04.413 --> 00:23:05.482
All right. this industry
doesn't give second chances.

423
00:23:05.482 --> 00:23:07.551
We can't blow this.

424
00:23:07.551 --> 00:23:09.896
- You know. that's funny.
because you got a second chance.

425
00:23:12.137 --> 00:23:13.000
- What?

426
00:23:15.482 --> 00:23:17.896
- I went and saw
Deidre last night.

427
00:23:17.896 --> 00:23:18.758
- Why would you do that?

428
00:23:19.551 --> 00:23:21.068
- You know. probably
for the same reason

429
00:23:21.068 --> 00:23:22.034
you never told me why
you were arrested.

430
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.103
- Look. baby.

431
00:23:25.103 --> 00:23:26.965
- Look. do not "baby" me.

432
00:23:28.862 --> 00:23:29.724
What the hell?

433
00:23:30.965 --> 00:23:32.482
- Look. it's the
past. all right?

434
00:23:32.482 --> 00:23:33.517
She's the past.

435
00:23:33.517 --> 00:23:35.034
All right. let it go.

436
00:23:35.034 --> 00:23:36.965
- Why didn't you tell
me that she sings.

437
00:23:36.965 --> 00:23:38.896
or anything about
her for that matter?

438
00:23:39.896 --> 00:23:40.758
Or should I let that go. too?

439
00:23:42.551 --> 00:23:42.896
What else are you
hiding from me. Charles?

440
00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:44.896
- It's not what you think.

441
00:23:47.724 --> 00:23:48.793
Look. I did it for Jay.

442
00:23:48.793 --> 00:23:53.034
Okay. I kept secrets for him.

443
00:23:58.137 --> 00:23:59.000
All right. look.

444
00:24:01.655 --> 00:24:03.551
I was arrested for assault.

445
00:24:03.551 --> 00:24:05.586
All right. some
guy said I hit him

446
00:24:05.586 --> 00:24:06.724
after I saw him and
Deidra flirting.

447
00:24:09.034 --> 00:24:10.241
I got jealous and
confronted him.

448
00:24:10.241 --> 00:24:12.103
- And did you hit him?

449
00:24:12.103 --> 00:24:13.896
- No. no. but the police
didn't believe me.

450
00:24:14.862 --> 00:24:16.551
I was a hothead back then

451
00:24:16.551 --> 00:24:18.827
and it wasn't the first time
I was in trouble with the law.

452
00:24:20.034 --> 00:24:20.965
- Not your first time?

453
00:24:22.862 --> 00:24:25.172
- Look. our
relationship was toxic.

454
00:24:25.172 --> 00:24:26.103
She reveled in the drama.

455
00:24:27.931 --> 00:24:31.000
- Yeah. but why
didn't you tell me?

456
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.586
- Well. I had my
record expunged.

457
00:24:33.586 --> 00:24:35.034
Right. I paid a PR
team to erase me

458
00:24:35.034 --> 00:24:37.482
and Deidra's internet history

459
00:24:37.758 --> 00:24:38.965
because I didn't
want Jay to know

460
00:24:38.965 --> 00:24:41.000
he had a father
that was a criminal

461
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
and a mother who went to a
mental health institution.

462
00:24:45.896 --> 00:24:48.206
Oh.

463
00:24:48.206 --> 00:24:49.965
I bet she left
that part out. too.

464
00:24:53.103 --> 00:24:54.793
- Well. did she sing?

465
00:24:56.724 --> 00:24:58.000
- Did she sing?

466
00:24:59.068 --> 00:24:59.965
Yeah. a little.

467
00:25:01.275 --> 00:25:03.965
But she wasn't a star.

468
00:25:03.965 --> 00:25:05.172
Not like you.

469
00:25:05.172 --> 00:25:06.724
- Charles. I am your wife.

470
00:25:06.724 --> 00:25:09.034
Do you know how stupid I felt?

471
00:25:09.034 --> 00:25:10.000
It's like I don't even know you.

472
00:25:12.275 --> 00:25:13.620
- Now you know me.

473
00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:15.862
- So does Deidra and Jessica.

474
00:25:18.034 --> 00:25:20.551
- Look. I know I betrayed
your trust in the past.

475
00:25:20.551 --> 00:25:24.137
and I know I don't deserve
it. but I'm asking you.

476
00:25:24.137 --> 00:25:25.034
look Tammy. you're
raising my son.

477
00:25:26.689 --> 00:25:28.862
Hell. I won't pretend that
I can do this without you.

478
00:25:32.655 --> 00:25:33.793
No more secrets. Tammy.

479
00:25:35.655 --> 00:25:36.103
Okay. I promise.

480
00:25:48.103 --> 00:25:49.965
- Deidra's not seeking
full custody anymore.

481
00:25:51.655 --> 00:25:52.000
She's okay with co-parenting.

482
00:25:54.793 --> 00:25:56.172
- Well. well how?

483
00:25:56.172 --> 00:25:57.793
I mean.

484
00:25:57.793 --> 00:25:59.137
- Does it matter?

485
00:25:59.137 --> 00:25:59.896
It's done.

486
00:26:03.241 --> 00:26:04.620
Hey. I mean. I don't
know what to say.

487
00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:06.034
I mean. I'm just-

488
00:26:06.034 --> 00:26:06.896
- You know what. Charles. just.

489
00:26:08.724 --> 00:26:10.965
promise me you'll be honest
with me from here on out.

490
00:26:12.379 --> 00:26:14.620
- Baby. I promise.

- What is it?

498
00:28:26.758 --> 00:28:28.758
- Charles' file is sealed.

499
00:28:28.758 --> 00:28:30.000
but the other guy's file isn't.

500
00:28:31.172 --> 00:28:33.379
Jimmy Franklin. a real shit bag.

501
00:28:33.379 --> 00:28:36.344
Habitual criminal with
more assault charges

502
00:28:36.344 --> 00:28:37.241
than he has birthdays.

503
00:28:39.413 --> 00:28:41.517
- How will this help
me get to the truth?

504
00:28:41.517 --> 00:28:43.000
- Charles didn't do it.

505
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:45.379
- He didn't?

506
00:28:45.379 --> 00:28:46.931
- Page six. superstar.

507
00:28:53.068 --> 00:28:55.379
- What is this I'm looking at?

508
00:28:55.379 --> 00:28:56.310
- It's a transcript
from a criminal case

509
00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:57.931
where Jimmy was a
state star witness.

510
00:29:00.137 --> 00:29:02.275
The defense attorney
raised concerns

511
00:29:02.275 --> 00:29:03.310
about his credibility
as a witness.

512
00:29:03.862 --> 00:29:05.275
He cites Charles's
case as his reason.

513
00:29:06.448 --> 00:29:08.551
- Hmm.

514
00:29:08.551 --> 00:29:12.379
Jimmy Franklin knowingly and
willingly pressed false charges

515
00:29:12.379 --> 00:29:15.137
on Charles Harper
only to drop his claim

516
00:29:15.689 --> 00:29:18.517
after his allegations
could not be corroborated.

517
00:29:20.034 --> 00:29:21.034
Why would he do that?

518
00:29:22.827 --> 00:29:24.137
- Why does any man do
what he does for a woman?

519
00:29:33.896 --> 00:29:35.586
- I gotta go.

520
00:29:35.586 --> 00:29:39.896
I have this IG Live thing I
have to do. but thank you.

521

You're amazing.

you and Ms. Deidre Love
conspired against Mr. Harper.

for you in five. Ms. Wilson.

[tense music]

531
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:14.448
Hey guys. so I'm gonna
answer some questions.

532
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.103
What inspired "You and I?"

533
00:30:20.137 --> 00:30:23.517
I would say love.
pure. unfiltered love.

534
00:30:25.586 --> 00:30:29.137
And when I recorded it. it
was my hope that you guys.

535
00:30:29.137 --> 00:30:30.206
my fans. walk away
feeling that same love.

536
00:30:33.172 --> 00:30:34.137
- Unbelievable.

537

get ahead of that.

just be a weird coincidence.

up with that package.

and she defended herself.

to worry about any of that.

- [Pam] No. I'll handle it.

867
00:51:26.310 --> 00:51:29.482
You just get her as far
away from here as possible.

868
00:51:29.482 --> 00:51:30.689

clean up the crime scene

869
00:51:30.689 --> 00:51:31.517
while we're away.

870
00:51:31.517 --> 00:51:33.068
- Just stop. stop.

871
00:51:36.689 --> 00:51:37.413
I'm not leaving.

872
00:51:39.724 --> 00:51:42.344
- We can't stay here.

873
00:51:42.344 --> 00:51:44.586
- So what. I'm supposed
to go out there?

874
00:51:44.586 --> 00:51:46.379
You think that's gonna
bring me peace of mind?

875
00:51:46.379 --> 00:51:47.689
- Tammy.

876
00:51:47.689 --> 00:51:50.655
- This is not a crime scene.

877
00:51:50.655 --> 00:51:53.344
This is our home and I
will not be run away.

878
00:51:54.206 --> 00:51:57.241
- Someone was in here.

879
00:51:58.551 --> 00:51:59.551
Now we need to think
smart about this

880
00:51:59.551 --> 00:52:01.413
until I can hire
a security team.

881
00:52:01.413 --> 00:52:02.724
I mean. what if there's
another deranged fan out there?

882
00:52:02.724 --> 00:52:04.310
- This wasn't a fan.

883
00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:09.655
It was Deidre.

884
00:52:11.517 --> 00:52:13.344
- Deidra?

885
00:52:13.344 --> 00:52:14.862
- Yes.

886
00:52:14.862 --> 00:52:16.689
Look. the pictures
were all fake.

887
00:52:18.793 --> 00:52:23.413
Yes. it was my face.
but it was not my body.

888
00:52:23.413 --> 00:52:24.655
- That doesn't mean it was her.

889
00:52:26.448 --> 00:52:27.689
Crazy fans make fake
photos all the time.

890
00:52:27.689 --> 00:52:28.862
- What about the call?

891
00:52:28.862 --> 00:52:30.896
- You didn't hear her voice.

892
00:52:30.896 --> 00:52:34.551
- Yeah. but my bangle
and. and. and lingerie.

893
00:52:34.551 --> 00:52:36.241
It was missing.
- Tammy.

894
00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:39.862
- So y'all think I'm crazy.

895
00:52:39.862 --> 00:52:43.862
- No. but we can't rock
the boat with Deidre

896
00:52:43.862 --> 00:52:46.896
or anyone right now.

897
00:52:46.896 --> 00:52:50.655
And making accusations we
can't prove can backfire on us.

898
00:52:50.655 --> 00:52:53.482
