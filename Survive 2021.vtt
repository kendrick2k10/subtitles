00:12:28.666 --> 00:12:30.666
Mother: Okay look at me!

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.974
News VO: At this point we can confirm

8
00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.334
international organization
behind this uprising.

9
00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.454
Analysts have found direct ties

10
00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.934
between the insurgency cells

11
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.814
popping up across the mainland

12
00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.814
with outside coordination.

13
00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.814
We are urging citizens

14
00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:04.174
to lock their doors and
avoid populated areas.

15
00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.534
By establishing these
cells at the grassroots level

16
00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:10.174
their local knowledge is unrivaled.

17
00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.574
They know the terrain.

18
00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:14.374
They've moved quickly to seize resources

19
00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.374
and overthrow civil administration.

20
00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.414
If you live in or near a DMZ region

21
00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.640
find shelter immediately-

22
00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.814
Mother: Okay look at me.

23
00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.814

24
00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.854

27
00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:29.814
Radio Message: I hope you can hear me...

28
00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:32.334
If you can. it's because I made it.

29
00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:34.814
I made it to Fort Franklin.

30
00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:36.494

31
00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:38.494

about getting back to you.

38
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.654
I did what I had to so you
and Mom could escape.

39
00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:00.960

And I'm here now.

42
00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:07.294

43
00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:10.494
but nothing else matters now.

44
00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:12.854

We can have a life here. we'll survive.

48
00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:24.814
I will never stop waiting for you.

49
00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:26.814
