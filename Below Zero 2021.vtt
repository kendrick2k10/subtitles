00:01:07.416 --> 00:01:08.958
Fuck you!

5
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:12.916
I already told you
I don't know anything. man!

6
00:01:17.125 --> 00:01:20.208
Leave me alone. for God's sake!
I don't know anything.

7
00:01:20.291 --> 00:01:21.750
I already told you!

8
00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:34.583
I told you. I don't know anything.

9
00:01:37.208 --> 00:01:40.041
No. please.

10
00:01:41.541 --> 00:01:42.541
Please.

11
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.333
Where is she?

12
00:01:45.416 --> 00:01:47.333
-I said I don't know.
-Tell me.

13
00:01:47.416 --> 00:01:49.750
She's not there. I don't know. I swear.

14
00:01:59.541 --> 00:02:01.750
No. please…

15
00:02:01.833 --> 00:02:03.458
Not so cocky now. huh?

16
00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:04.875
-Please…
-Chino.

17
00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.750
I told you.
I don't know where she is. please.

18
00:02:07.833 --> 00:02:09.166
Please.

19
00:02:29.083 --> 00:02:29.916
No!

20
00:02:33.083 --> 00:02:34.333
Stop it. you bastard!

21
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.041
You son of a bitch!

22
00:03:14.833 --> 00:03:19.708
Temperatures will drop
across the peninsula and on the Balearics.

23
00:03:19.791 --> 00:03:22.333
OK. but we've been waiting here for ages.

24
00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.458
How long will that be?

25
00:03:25.916 --> 00:03:27.916
OK. thanks.

26
00:03:28.916 --> 00:03:30.125
They'll be a while.

27
00:03:30.208 --> 00:03:31.625
With strong spells across…

28
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.458
We'll be late to pick up Emma.

29
00:03:38.708 --> 00:03:40.291
You go. I'll change the tire.

30
00:03:42.083 --> 00:03:42.916
Are you sure?

31
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.166
Yes.

32
00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:46.458
Darling.

33
00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:47.583
Be good. OK?

34
00:03:47.666 --> 00:03:50.500
Cloudy skies with early showers…

35
00:03:50.583 --> 00:03:52.291
See you later. then.

36
00:03:55.416 --> 00:03:56.625
Bye. Mommy.

37
00:03:58.916 --> 00:04:00.750
What are we going to do. Daddy?

38
00:04:16.041 --> 00:04:17.208
Hey. Daddy?

39
00:04:17.708 --> 00:04:20.458
-What. darling?
-What happens to the old one?

40
00:04:21.166 --> 00:04:22.250
The tire?

41
00:04:22.791 --> 00:04:24.041
We'll throw it away.

42
00:04:24.708 --> 00:04:25.833
Why?

43
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.000
It's just a tire. The car is what matters.

44
00:04:31.333 --> 00:04:34.333
I'm nearly done.
Close the window. it's cold. Go on.

45
00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.875
For fuck's sake!

46
00:04:47.041 --> 00:04:48.166
Give me a break!

47
00:04:55.833 --> 00:04:58.833
My God. Carlos. what a mess.
Wipe that up first.

48
00:04:58.916 --> 00:05:00.750
-Over there.
-Excuse me.

49
00:05:01.875 --> 00:05:05.083
This place is a nightmare.
Honestly. it's unbelievable.

50
00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.666
Let go of me. pig! Don't fucking touch me.

51
00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.083
-Come on. man!
-Don't touch me!

52
00:05:16.166 --> 00:05:17.791
What a circus.

53
00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.166
Who are you?

54
00:05:20.666 --> 00:05:21.541
Martín Salas.

55
00:05:22.125 --> 00:05:23.208
Northern precinct.

56
00:05:27.208 --> 00:05:28.541
Right. Here it is.

57
00:05:30.041 --> 00:05:34.541
You're down for a prisoner transfer.
Not bad for your first day. huh?

58
00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:38.125
And with Montesinos. Not your lucky day.

59
00:05:39.583 --> 00:05:41.416
The locker room's down there.

60
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Bon appétit.

61
00:05:46.666 --> 00:05:51.083
-You're wearing it again. That's ballsy.
-An earring doesn't affect my work.

62
00:05:51.166 --> 00:05:54.708
-True. But the sergeant won't like it.
-Fuck him. The union backs me.

63
00:05:54.791 --> 00:05:58.458
Maybe I'll even get a tattoo on my face.
just to piss him off.

64
00:06:11.458 --> 00:06:13.291
-Martín?
-That's right.

65
00:06:14.083 --> 00:06:15.250
Montesinos.

66
00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.666
Have you ever done
a transfer in this area?

67
00:06:20.166 --> 00:06:21.041
No.

68
00:06:21.625 --> 00:06:23.458
You're gonna freeze your balls off.

69
00:06:34.083 --> 00:06:37.958
Shit. To get to the prison in Cuenca.
we need to take back roads. No choice.

70
00:06:38.041 --> 00:06:40.250
It's either that or three more hours.

71
00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:43.166
-We'll see how much snow there is.
-It seems OK.

72
00:06:44.041 --> 00:06:48.958
-And why do a transfer at night?
-It's not uncommon. There's no fixed time.

73
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.750
Discretion and safety are
what matter most.

74
00:06:52.833 --> 00:06:54.708
That's why we can't bring phones.

75
00:06:54.791 --> 00:06:57.166
and the prisoners are told
at the last minute.

76
00:07:02.791 --> 00:07:05.875
CORRECTIONAL FACILITY

77
00:07:07.583 --> 00:07:09.166
-Hello.
-Good evening.

78
00:07:20.083 --> 00:07:21.833
-Go ahead.
-Thanks.

79
00:07:40.291 --> 00:07:42.666
Six prisoners escorted by a patrol car.

80
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.541
-How come?
-There's a max custody. a Romanian.

81
00:07:46.291 --> 00:07:47.916
He looks like a real bastard.

82
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.541
The boss of an international gang.

83
00:07:51.125 --> 00:07:52.750
Arms trafficking. sex trafficking.

84
00:07:52.833 --> 00:07:55.833
He had 200 girls working for him
when he was arrested.

85
00:07:56.833 --> 00:08:00.250
During a routine cell search.
the fucker slit a guard's throat

86
00:08:00.333 --> 00:08:03.208
with a piece of metal
hidden in the sole of his shoe.

87
00:08:03.291 --> 00:08:04.541
There's always one gem.

88
00:08:04.625 --> 00:08:06.458
I hope the others are better.

89
00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:10.708
We have all sorts. Most are misdemeanors.

90
00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:13.625
Low-level dealing and some burglaries.

91
00:08:21.416 --> 00:08:22.958
-Good evening.
-Hello.

92
00:08:23.041 --> 00:08:25.000
You'll love this. A politician.

93
00:08:25.083 --> 00:08:28.333
-Never heard of him. Is he famous?
-Search room two. West wing.

94
00:08:28.416 --> 00:08:29.958
-Follow the officer.
-Thanks.

95
00:08:30.041 --> 00:08:32.833
No fucking idea. Some accountant.

96
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:44.583
Mihai Lungo.

97
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.208

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.416
-It's about time. man.
-Come on. move.

101
00:09:43.791 --> 00:09:44.916
Get dressed.

102

-You.
-Thank you. officer.

103
00:09:48.333 --> 00:09:49.166
Next.

104
00:09:50.625 --> 00:09:52.000
Put your clothes there.

105
00:09:53.291 --> 00:09:54.625
Arms out.

106
00:09:55.416 --> 00:09:57.291
Open your mouth. Tongue up.

107
00:09:58.041 --> 00:09:59.250
Tongue out. Move it.

108
00:09:59.791 --> 00:10:00.958
Cough.

109
00:10:02.208 --> 00:10:04.833
Hold your underwear open.
Hands behind your head.

110
00:10:08.125 --> 00:10:09.541
OK. Get dressed.

111
00:10:11.833 --> 00:10:13.333
You. Next.

00:10:16.541 --> 00:10:17.791
Put your clothes there.

113
00:10:21.791 --> 00:10:23.083
Arms out.

114
00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:25.666
Mouth open.

115
00:10:27.875 --> 00:10:28.791
Tongue up.

116
00:10:30.041 --> 00:10:32.500
-Where are my lollipops?
-Here we go.

117
00:10:32.583 --> 00:10:33.750
You stole them.

118
00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:35.791
-Keep quiet.
-I can't believe it.

119
00:10:35.875 --> 00:10:38.083
You're despicable. Shame on you guys.

120
00:10:38.166 --> 00:10:39.250
Cough.

121
00:10:41.625 --> 00:10:43.166
Pull your underpants down.

122
00:10:47.791 --> 00:10:50.416
I got them prescribed for my anxiety.

123
00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.416
I'm positive he's got them.

124
00:10:53.583 --> 00:10:54.416
Get dressed.

125
00:10:56.208 --> 00:10:57.291
Oh my God.

126
00:10:57.791 --> 00:10:59.000
I'm sorry. all right?

127
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.791
They were here. Sorry.

128
00:11:01.916 --> 00:11:02.916
You.

129
00:11:03.416 --> 00:11:04.458
Next.

130
00:11:05.791 --> 00:11:07.500
OK. Put your clothes there.

131
00:11:10.333 --> 00:11:11.166
What's this?

132
00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:13.333
Don't take it off me. bro.

133
00:11:13.416 --> 00:11:16.208
-My sister gave it to me.
-No worries. I won't.

134
00:11:16.291 --> 00:11:17.375
You'll take it off.

135
00:11:18.875 --> 00:11:19.750
Come on.

136
00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:25.541
Arms out.

137
00:11:25.625 --> 00:11:26.541
Don't keep it.

138
00:11:26.625 --> 00:11:29.375
No one will. It goes in the bag.
Open your mouth.

139
00:11:30.041 --> 00:11:33.500
Last time I was searched.
you took some CDs off me.

140
00:11:33.583 --> 00:11:35.541
-What's it to me?
-Just saying.

141
00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:39.375
-We should have the right to music.
-Get your clothes.

142
00:11:39.875 --> 00:11:41.083
You. next.

143
00:11:41.166 --> 00:11:43.250
They're a pain. right. officer?

144
00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.875
Don't waste your breath. Pardo.

145
00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.291
These ones won't give you any money.

146
00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:49.333
Put them there.

147
00:11:52.125 --> 00:11:53.166
Julio. right?

148
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.125
-I prefer "Ramis." It's my stage name.
-Open your mouth.

149
00:12:01.875 --> 00:12:05.875
-You know it by heart.
-I'm a professional. Unlike those guys.

150
00:12:07.541 --> 00:12:09.666
You're shameless. Ramis.

151
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:11.916
I'm an artist.

152
00:12:12.541 --> 00:12:13.875
OK. Get dressed.

153
00:12:14.916 --> 00:12:16.375
You. next.

154
00:12:17.416 --> 00:12:20.333
No personal items allowed
during transfers. Sorry.

155
00:12:20.416 --> 00:12:21.458
I'm studying.

156
00:12:22.583 --> 00:12:24.250
Starting a business in jail?

157
00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:26.500
Not here. In the Caribbean.

158
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.208
The best bar ever.

159
00:12:28.291 --> 00:12:31.166
You're all invited to the opening.
No hard feelings.

160
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:32.791
Put your clothes there.

161
00:12:37.375 --> 00:12:39.083
-What was that?
-They're too tight.

162
00:12:39.166 --> 00:12:40.541
Fuck you. you asshole.

163
00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.125
Cough.

164
00:12:44.625 --> 00:12:46.250
Hold your underpants open.

165
00:12:49.583 --> 00:12:50.875
Hands behind your head.

166
00:12:51.375 --> 00:12:54.541
-You love eyeing up cocks.
-What did you say?

167
00:12:54.625 --> 00:12:55.625
Nothing.

168
00:12:55.708 --> 00:12:58.250
Underpants down.
hands behind your head. and crouch.

169
00:12:59.333 --> 00:13:01.083
-Why?
-You heard me.

170
00:13:01.166 --> 00:13:02.000
But. dude--

171
00:13:02.083 --> 00:13:04.916
Underpants down.
hands behind your head. and crouch.

172
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.583
-Tell me why.
-Do you want a smack?

173
00:13:06.666 --> 00:13:07.500
All right.

174
00:13:15.166 --> 00:13:16.333
Now cough.

175
00:13:20.125 --> 00:13:20.958
Cough harder.

176
00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:23.791
Stand up.

177
00:13:28.166 --> 00:13:29.041
Get your clothes.

178
00:13:29.625 --> 00:13:32.125
-Asshole.
-What did you say. you brat?

179
00:13:32.208 --> 00:13:34.375
-Hey!
-Hey. you bastard!

180
00:13:34.458 --> 00:13:36.541
-Stop it!
-What are you doing?

181
00:13:36.625 --> 00:13:37.875
What am I doing?

182
00:13:39.375 --> 00:13:41.833
Shit. I'm sick and tired of these pricks.

183
00:13:41.916 --> 00:13:43.500
Come on. let him go.

184
00:13:46.916 --> 00:13:47.750
Beat it.

185
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.166
Are the bags ready?

186
00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:56.166
They are.

187
00:13:56.666 --> 00:13:57.625
Off we go. then.

188
00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.083
-Hands.
-Hold on. Wait there.

189
00:14:46.333 --> 00:14:47.208
Come on.

190
00:14:54.125 --> 00:14:55.000
In you go.

191
00:14:58.083 --> 00:15:00.833
What about the handcuffs? I want them off.

192
00:15:00.916 --> 00:15:02.041
Over my dead body.

193
00:15:03.125 --> 00:15:04.000
Go on.

194
00:15:06.833 --> 00:15:09.125
Hurry up. We're fucking freezing. man.

195
00:15:35.125 --> 00:15:36.333
Thanks. officer.

196
00:15:37.541 --> 00:15:38.666
Next.

197
00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:50.791
Go on in.

198
00:15:55.583 --> 00:15:56.416
Get in.

199
00:15:56.916 --> 00:15:57.750
Officer…

200
00:15:58.375 --> 00:15:59.458
What's the matter?

201
00:15:59.541 --> 00:16:01.041
I'm cooperating. aren't I?

202
00:16:01.125 --> 00:16:02.875
You can cooperate and sit down.

203
00:16:03.375 --> 00:16:05.125
Why am I cuffed and others aren't?

204
00:16:05.208 --> 00:16:07.500
You're different. Ramis. I read your file.

205
00:16:07.583 --> 00:16:12.666
-That was one time.
-Listen. try anything and I'll kill you.

206
00:16:14.291 --> 00:16:15.666
There's no need for that.

207
00:16:19.833 --> 00:16:22.250
-Have a good shift.
-Thanks. Hope it goes well.

208
00:16:22.333 --> 00:16:23.166
Listen…

209
00:16:26.916 --> 00:16:30.416
You need to ease up a bit
with all the rules. man.

210
00:16:31.125 --> 00:16:33.291
We can't ease up with that. Montesinos.

211
00:16:34.291 --> 00:16:36.333
Why not? Is that against the rules?

212
00:16:37.083 --> 00:16:38.083
Exactly.

213
00:16:39.791 --> 00:16:43.750
-Whatever. But don't be like a robot.
-It's simply in my nature.

214
00:16:43.833 --> 00:16:45.250
I just follow the rules.

215
00:16:45.833 --> 00:16:47.916
-But we're partners. right?
-Sure.

216
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.041
-Partners have each other's backs.
-This isn't about being partners.

217
00:16:52.125 --> 00:16:53.250
-Isn't it?
-No.

218
00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:55.625
In fact. I'm being a good partner.

219
00:16:55.708 --> 00:16:56.708
By warning you.

220
00:16:56.791 --> 00:17:00.083
You? Warning me? What about?
I don't fucking need this.

221
00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:04.833
When was your last transfer?
You have no idea.

222
00:17:04.916 --> 00:17:08.000
I know you can't hit
the first guy that pisses you off.

223
00:17:08.083 --> 00:17:09.875
We know how this works. right?

224
00:17:10.375 --> 00:17:11.958
They all like to piss us off.

225
00:17:20.416 --> 00:17:22.625
Maybe they were right about you after all.

226
00:17:23.416 --> 00:17:24.750
Maybe they were.

227
00:17:26.208 --> 00:17:27.291
What did they say?

228
00:20:20.875 --> 00:20:22.541
Stop knocking like that.

229
00:20:23.125 --> 00:20:24.375
It's cold.

230
00:20:24.458 --> 00:20:26.833
-It's not my fault.
-Turn the heat up.

231
00:20:26.916 --> 00:20:30.333
-You don't pay the bill. after all.
-I'm not so sure.

232
00:20:30.416 --> 00:20:33.041
Do you know
how much the State spends on you?

233
00:20:33.125 --> 00:20:34.916
Here comes the economist.

234
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.791
Fuck off. Pardo.
You learned math by stealing.

235
00:20:37.875 --> 00:20:40.666
Over 20.000 euros on each of you.

236
00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:44.208
With everything you stole…
What the fuck's your point?

237
00:20:44.291 --> 00:20:46.291
Keeping you around is a waste.

238
00:20:46.375 --> 00:20:48.708
Parasites. That's what you are.

239
00:20:49.291 --> 00:20:50.291
Will you shut up?

240
00:20:50.375 --> 00:20:51.791
Why the fuck should I?

241
00:20:52.291 --> 00:20:54.500
How much have you ever contributed?

242
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.666
Have you ever bothered
to contribute to society?

243
00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:01.166
But. oh yes. we all want the same rights.

244
00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:02.083
Sure!

245
00:21:02.166 --> 00:21:04.708
Right to vote. choose. give your opinion…

246
00:21:04.791 --> 00:21:06.666
Will the grandpa ever shut up?

247
00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:08.416
Everyone's entitled to an opinion.

248
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.583
For fuck's sake. Pardo.
Shut up. this isn't a rally.

249
00:21:11.666 --> 00:21:12.500
Shit.

250
00:21:12.583 --> 00:21:15.916
I'm sick of your speeches.
You sound like my old man.

251
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:16.958
Fucking fascist.

252
00:21:18.083 --> 00:21:19.916
Who? Pardo or your old man?

253
00:21:21.208 --> 00:21:22.041
Both.

254
00:21:24.208 --> 00:21:26.541
The State of the Nation debate is over.

255
00:21:26.625 --> 00:21:30.125
-Bedtime.
-I only want the fucking heat turned up.

256
00:21:33.625 --> 00:21:36.166
Martín. turn the heat up back here.

257
00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:39.625
-Hopefully. these jerks will shut up.
-Copy that.

258
00:22:22.125 --> 00:22:22.958
4ML?

259
00:22:24.125 --> 00:22:28.208
-Who the fuck does he think he is?
-The villagers here drive like madmen.

260
00:22:29.041 --> 00:22:29.875
Right…

261
00:22:52.083 --> 00:22:52.916
Boss?

262
00:22:53.416 --> 00:22:54.666
What's up now?

263
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:56.625
I need to take a shit.

264
00:22:57.708 --> 00:22:59.291
Off to sleep. Ramis.

265
00:23:05.541 --> 00:23:07.958
Let him out. boss.
We're suffocating in here.

266
00:23:08.041 --> 00:23:10.375
-Jesus. it stinks.
-Son of a bitch. bro.

267
00:23:11.708 --> 00:23:13.916
Please. officer.
I can't hold it any longer.

268
00:23:15.791 --> 00:23:17.875
You're getting on my nerves. Ramis.

269
00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:25.750
Sorry. Thank you. boss.

270
00:23:28.208 --> 00:23:31.291
It's just that
I think I have a bug or something.

271
00:23:31.375 --> 00:23:33.791
And the cold makes me need to shit too.

272
00:23:33.875 --> 00:23:35.750
All right. In you go.

273
00:23:40.875 --> 00:23:41.708
Hands.

274
00:23:47.541 --> 00:23:48.666
A little privacy?

275
00:23:50.333 --> 00:23:51.416
Make it quick.

276
00:24:59.625 --> 00:25:00.458
Come on. Ramis.

277
00:25:06.333 --> 00:25:07.791
-Hurry up.
-I'm done.

278
00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:37.333
4M2?

279
00:25:38.541 --> 00:25:39.875
Do you copy? I can't see you.

280
00:25:40.375 --> 00:25:41.791
We're here. 200 meters ahead.

281
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.166
4M2. it's too foggy. Please slow down.

282
00:25:57.458 --> 00:25:58.541
Get in.

283
00:26:15.291 --> 00:26:18.416
4M2. I've lost visual. Can you hear me?

284
00:26:19.291 --> 00:26:20.208
Are you there?

285
00:26:37.625 --> 00:26:38.458
What the fuck?

286
00:26:42.208 --> 00:26:43.666
Shit! Be careful!

287
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:45.583
There are people back here.

288
00:26:45.666 --> 00:26:50.041
-These bastards drive worse each day.
-Are we cattle or what?

289
00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:53.041
Martín. what's up? Why did we stop?

290
00:26:53.125 --> 00:26:55.708
Not sure. I think we hit something.

291
00:26:56.833 --> 00:26:57.958
Why did we stop?

292
00:26:58.041 --> 00:27:00.416
There are many wild animals on this road.

293
00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:04.125
-Maybe we hit one.
-Or maybe he ran out of gas.

294
00:27:04.208 --> 00:27:09.458
-Start it up or warn the others.
-They're not here. They disappeared.

295
00:27:09.541 --> 00:27:14.250
-Disappeared? They must be up ahead. Move.
-They're not here. believe me.

296
00:27:14.333 --> 00:27:16.000
They were right in front. but then--

297
00:27:19.916 --> 00:27:20.875
Hold on a sec.

298
00:27:22.625 --> 00:27:25.416
The country's a mess.
They can't even afford gas.

299
00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:29.166
Thanks to crooks like you. Pardo.
You stole all we had.

300
00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:32.458
-Pardo. you're a crook--
-Shut the fuck up!

301
00:27:39.333 --> 00:27:41.083
-They're there.
-Can you see them?

302
00:27:41.166 --> 00:27:44.166
And why are you here. Ramis?
For being a smart-ass?

303
00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:47.666
I stole to open my bar.
Not to hide in Switzerland. like you.

304
00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:49.500
What are you saying?

305
00:27:49.583 --> 00:27:51.375
You're a thief. Just like me.

306
00:27:51.458 --> 00:27:55.291
Finally. you admit it. On TV you claimed
to be just an accountant.

307
00:27:59.125 --> 00:28:00.333
4M2.

308
00:28:01.291 --> 00:28:03.041
I see you. Why did you stop?

309
00:28:03.541 --> 00:28:05.041
What's going on out there?

310
00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:07.333
4M2.

311
00:28:07.916 --> 00:28:10.708
It's weird that we're stuck here. right?

312
00:28:12.916 --> 00:28:13.916
What did you say?

313
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
Speak Spanish so we can understand.

314
00:28:16.083 --> 00:28:18.416
What the hell's going on out there?

315
00:28:19.583 --> 00:28:22.416
No fucking clue. but it's odd
they're not answering.

316
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.875
-I think it's a punctured tire.
-No way. It's something else.

317
00:28:25.958 --> 00:28:27.041
I'm getting out.

318
00:28:27.125 --> 00:28:29.708
-So what is it. man?
-Punctured tire. you brat.

319
00:28:29.791 --> 00:28:31.083
"Brat"? Fuck you. junkie.

320
00:28:31.166 --> 00:28:32.708
Junkies love a good puncture.

321
00:28:32.791 --> 00:28:34.125
We sure do.

322
00:28:35.958 --> 00:28:36.791
Fuck.

323
00:28:37.791 --> 00:28:38.916
Rumano?

324
00:28:40.166 --> 00:28:41.375
What did you say?

325
00:28:42.625 --> 00:28:43.666
What do you know?

326
00:28:46.875 --> 00:28:50.625
Be careful out there. cop.
Don't catch a fucking cold. man.

327
00:28:50.708 --> 00:28:52.666
Bundle up. It's coming down hard.

328
00:28:53.625 --> 00:28:55.750
-What the fuck's going on?
-Sit tight.

329
00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:59.166
Bundle up. cop. It's cold.

330
00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:01.916
-What's happening?
-Nothing's fucking happening!

331
00:29:33.041 --> 00:29:35.791
Rumano. is all this about you?

332
00:29:37.583 --> 00:29:41.041
My brother Cosmin said
he wouldn't let me rot in jail.

333
00:29:41.708 --> 00:29:43.541
He may need a hand.

334
00:29:44.333 --> 00:29:46.125
Like my mom used to say.

335
00:29:47.333 --> 00:29:49.125
I was born under a lucky star.

336
00:29:56.541 --> 00:29:57.708
Montesinos. see anything?

337
00:29:57.791 --> 00:29:59.583
Ramis. what's going on?

338
00:30:00.958 --> 00:30:02.208
Now that you ask…

339
00:30:04.458 --> 00:30:05.291
I'm gonna split.

340
00:30:05.375 --> 00:30:06.625
What do you mean?

341
00:30:06.708 --> 00:30:08.958
-He says he's leaving.
-To open my bar.

342
00:30:09.041 --> 00:30:10.500
You can all get fucked.

343
00:30:11.583 --> 00:30:12.583
I'll be clear.

344
00:30:13.291 --> 00:30:16.166
I can open my cell from inside.
What do you say to that?

345
00:30:17.541 --> 00:30:18.458
Sure you can.

346
00:30:19.166 --> 00:30:20.541
Then let us all out.

347
00:30:20.625 --> 00:30:23.500
-Yeah. let us out.
-One thing at a time.

348
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.750
There's CCTV.
We'll be screwed if they see us.

349
00:30:26.833 --> 00:30:28.125
Leave me out of this.

350
00:30:28.208 --> 00:30:29.791
I don't want any trouble.

351
00:30:34.958 --> 00:30:36.500
What's going on. Montesinos?

352
00:30:44.625 --> 00:30:47.083
-Will you let us out. bro?
-Of course.

353
00:30:47.166 --> 00:30:49.458
When the cop's back.
ask to use the crapper.

354
00:30:49.541 --> 00:30:53.291
-I'll come out and we both grab him. OK?
-Count on me. Then we're gone.

355
00:30:53.875 --> 00:30:55.916
-What about the driver?
-No problem.

356
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.083
We'll take mustache hostage
and use his key.

357
00:30:58.166 --> 00:30:59.916
Ramis. don't leave me behind.

358
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.791
Jesus. Gollum. Of course not.

359
00:31:04.875 --> 00:31:08.291
Shit. Montesinos. what's going on?

360
00:31:10.666 --> 00:31:11.833
Montesinos?

361
00:31:12.375 --> 00:31:13.291
Do you copy?

362
00:31:15.333 --> 00:31:16.791
Montesinos. answer.

363
00:31:39.041 --> 00:31:40.500
What a shitty plan.

364
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.875
No wonder you always get caught. Ramis.

365
00:31:58.208 --> 00:31:59.750
This won't end well.

366
00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:03.125
You versus two cops.
They'll call for backup.

367
00:32:03.208 --> 00:32:04.750
Shut up. man.

368
00:32:12.125 --> 00:32:12.958
Come on.

369
00:33:10.291 --> 00:33:11.166
Montesinos?

370
00:33:37.166 --> 00:33:38.041
Montesinos.

371
00:34:06.708 --> 00:34:08.208
No.

372
00:34:21.666 --> 00:34:22.500
No.

373
00:34:26.416 --> 00:34:27.333
What was that?

374
00:34:27.416 --> 00:34:29.500
-What's going on?
-Were those shots?

375
00:34:31.666 --> 00:34:34.250
-There's someone out there.
-Rumano!

376
00:34:34.333 --> 00:34:37.166
I bet they're your pals.
Aren't they. Rumano?

377
00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:40.916
Who are those guys. man?
Your pals don't mess around. do they?

378
00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:55.333
Headquarters?

379
00:35:56.291 --> 00:35:59.416
Headquarters. 3ML speaking. Do you copy?

380
00:36:00.458 --> 00:36:03.500
We've been attacked.
Three officers are dead. Do you copy?

381
00:36:04.916 --> 00:36:05.750
Headqua--

382
00:36:12.833 --> 00:36:16.500
Come on.

383
00:36:50.583 --> 00:36:51.541
What happened?

384
00:36:51.625 --> 00:36:53.833
-What's going on?
-Where's your partner?

385
00:36:53.916 --> 00:36:56.708
You're gonna make us all freak out. cop.

386
00:36:56.791 --> 00:36:59.000
-Answer. boss.
-He isn't there.

387
00:36:59.083 --> 00:37:02.041
-Where's the mustache guy?
-Hey. boss. are you OK?

388
00:37:02.666 --> 00:37:03.625
Fucking answer me!

389
00:37:03.708 --> 00:37:05.375
-Hey!
-We're on our own!

390
00:37:05.458 --> 00:37:06.791
What the fuck is going on?

391
00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.375
What the hell happened to you. man?

392
00:37:11.458 --> 00:37:12.458
What the fuck. cop?

393
00:37:14.958 --> 00:37:16.333
-Sit down!
-Hey. cop…

394
00:37:16.416 --> 00:37:18.458
-Shut up!
-Son of a bitch!

395
00:37:19.875 --> 00:37:20.833
What's he up to?

396
00:37:21.375 --> 00:37:23.166
Can anyone see anything?

397
00:37:23.666 --> 00:37:25.875
-He opened the first aid kit.
-Is he injured?

398
00:37:25.958 --> 00:37:27.541
He's bleeding and limping.

399
00:37:27.625 --> 00:37:29.041
I guess. I can't see where.

400
00:37:32.708 --> 00:37:35.166
Hey. cop. where's your partner?

401
00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:37.083
Did he go for a leak?

402
00:37:37.166 --> 00:37:39.166
It seems there's someone out there.

403
00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:40.791
-Fuck.
-Rumano!

404
00:37:41.625 --> 00:37:43.125
They're your guys. for sure.

405
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.666
You're scaring us shitless.

406
00:37:47.166 --> 00:37:48.875
We'd better stay inside.

407
00:37:48.958 --> 00:37:50.666
I'm not staying. For real.

408
00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:55.166
No one is staying! We're all going!
Rumano! What the fuck is going on?

409
00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:56.375
You all talk too much.

410
00:37:56.458 --> 00:37:59.791
-Shut the fuck up.
-But are they your guys?

411
00:38:00.375 --> 00:38:01.583
We have to wait. Period.

412
00:38:04.083 --> 00:38:06.333
-Can you see anything?
-Pardo. do you see?

413
00:38:06.416 --> 00:38:08.000
I can't see anything.

414
00:38:08.083 --> 00:38:09.875
Piggy…

415
00:38:10.583 --> 00:38:12.708
What happened to your leg. piggy?

416
00:38:14.833 --> 00:38:18.125
Do you have a boo-boo? Piggy…

417
00:38:25.333 --> 00:38:26.666
What the hell is that?

418
00:38:32.791 --> 00:38:33.791
Is that a drill?

419
00:38:35.791 --> 00:38:38.875
Officer. what's that noise?
What the hell's going on?

420
00:38:38.958 --> 00:38:41.458
Officer. why are we stuck?

421
00:38:42.041 --> 00:38:43.291
What's going on?

422
00:38:44.041 --> 00:38:45.541
Where's the other pig?

423
00:38:45.625 --> 00:38:48.916
-I need to take a shit--
-Shut up. for fuck's sake!

424
00:38:50.083 --> 00:38:51.666
No one leaves this place.

425
00:38:55.875 --> 00:38:57.208
Are they here for you?

426
00:38:59.708 --> 00:39:01.208
Who are these people?

427
00:39:03.833 --> 00:39:05.833
They won't get in easily. Do you hear me?

428
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.333
It's an armored truck.

429
00:39:08.416 --> 00:39:11.458
That's not a problem.
We'll be out in two minutes.

430
00:39:11.541 --> 00:39:13.666
Rumano. I've always liked you people.

431
00:39:14.666 --> 00:39:16.333
Make him take off his pants.

432
00:39:16.416 --> 00:39:18.583
They'll tear this truck into pieces.

433
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:28.250
Hit him hard!

434
00:39:32.916 --> 00:39:34.041
Go. Ramis!

435
00:39:34.125 --> 00:39:35.416
Hit the pig!

436
00:39:38.791 --> 00:39:40.250
Go on. Ramis! Kill the Smurf!

437
00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:49.875
Come on. Robin Hood!

438
00:40:01.875 --> 00:40:02.875
Stop. Ramis!

439
00:40:03.583 --> 00:40:04.416
Get back!

440
00:40:08.458 --> 00:40:09.791
Put the gun down. man.

441
00:40:10.833 --> 00:40:12.291
Who are those guys?

442
00:40:14.541 --> 00:40:15.666
Are they here for you?

443
00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:20.750
Why are you asking me?
You're the one who went outside.

444
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.125
-Go back to your cell right now.
-Don't listen to him. Ramis.

445
00:40:30.208 --> 00:40:31.708
It's your call. cop.

446
00:40:32.333 --> 00:40:35.000
If Rumano's friends are out there.
get ready.

447
00:40:35.083 --> 00:40:36.833
They won't stop until they get him.

448
00:40:39.208 --> 00:40:40.958
Shit. this is gasoline.

449
00:40:41.916 --> 00:40:44.458
-Hey!
-Go back to your cell. Now.

450
00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:47.583
Shit!

451
00:40:48.208 --> 00:40:51.625
-Open up! There's a fire!
-Hey! What's going on?

452
00:40:51.708 --> 00:40:52.833
-Officer!
-Fire!

453
00:40:52.916 --> 00:40:55.500
Fire! The old man's burning!

454
00:40:56.083 --> 00:40:57.250
Freeze!

455
00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:00.083
Officer!

456
00:41:03.875 --> 00:41:05.125
Julio! He's on fire!

457
00:41:07.333 --> 00:41:08.416
Let's get him out.

458
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.208
-Fire!
-Let him out!

459
00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:13.916
Let me out. bro!

460
00:41:16.625 --> 00:41:18.625
-Get the extinguisher!
-Don't open it yet.

461
00:41:18.708 --> 00:41:19.916
OK! Go!

462
00:41:22.791 --> 00:41:23.916
God fucking damn it!

463
00:41:24.416 --> 00:41:25.333
Open it now!

464
00:41:25.916 --> 00:41:27.000
Open the door!

465
00:41:30.541 --> 00:41:33.125
Let me out. bro!
I'm on fire. you son of a bitch!

466
00:41:33.208 --> 00:41:34.458
Let me out!

467
00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:37.750
Open the door!

468
00:41:40.291 --> 00:41:42.208
I'm on fire. you son of a bitch!

469
00:41:43.333 --> 00:41:45.333
As fast as you can. Ramis.

470
00:41:46.208 --> 00:41:47.708
I'm fucking burning.

471
00:41:50.333 --> 00:41:52.250
Hold on. Done.

472
00:41:57.458 --> 00:41:58.916
Don't you dare. got it?

473
00:42:00.458 --> 00:42:01.666
Too late. cop.

474
00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:04.416
Don't move.

475
00:42:09.125 --> 00:42:10.500
You're outnumbered.

476
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.791
You'll be fewer
when I blow your head off. Get back.

477
00:42:13.875 --> 00:42:17.541
-There will still be more of us.
-You don't have the balls to shoot.

478
00:42:17.625 --> 00:42:18.708
Get back.

479
00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:24.250
-Where's your pal? You're all alone.
-Don't move.

480
00:42:24.333 --> 00:42:26.208
That guy's shitting his pants.

481
00:42:27.083 --> 00:42:30.375
-Aren't we pals anymore?
-Pals? You and me? No. Get back.

482
00:42:30.458 --> 00:42:32.833
-Don't move.
-Shoot me. I don't give a shit.

483
00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:43.375
Good evening.

484
00:42:46.375 --> 00:42:49.125
OK. I see there's a lot going on in there.

485
00:42:49.958 --> 00:42:51.333
That police officer

486
00:42:51.416 --> 00:42:54.791
has the only key
that lets you out of the truck.

487
00:42:56.375 --> 00:42:58.125
I can't get in.

488
00:42:58.208 --> 00:42:59.291
-Who's that?
-Shit.

489
00:42:59.375 --> 00:43:01.375
If you want to get out.

490
00:43:01.458 --> 00:43:03.208
you just have to let me in.

491
00:43:03.291 --> 00:43:06.041
What you do before or after
isn't my business.

492
00:43:06.125 --> 00:43:07.666
Rumano. they're not your pals.

493
00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:09.875
If you don't open up.

494
00:43:09.958 --> 00:43:11.916
you will all die.

495
00:43:12.416 --> 00:43:13.416
Oh. his gun…

496
00:43:15.958 --> 00:43:16.958
It's out of bullets.

497
00:43:22.708 --> 00:43:24.875
Don't move!

498
00:43:25.958 --> 00:43:27.625
You guys fucked up. big time.

499
00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:31.791
He wants something from in here.
Why else burn the cells?

500
00:43:31.875 --> 00:43:35.041
-So you'd free us. We'd get the key.
-What if he's not here for you?

501
00:43:36.791 --> 00:43:38.083
They're not your friends.

502
00:43:38.166 --> 00:43:40.583
That guy's Spanish.
He wants something else.

503
00:43:40.666 --> 00:43:43.333
I don't give a fuck who he is.
I'm getting out.

504
00:43:43.416 --> 00:43:44.708
Give me the fucking key.

505
00:43:44.791 --> 00:43:46.250
-Hey. pig!
-Don't move!

506
00:43:46.875 --> 00:43:48.666
-Grab him!
-Hold him!

507
00:43:49.166 --> 00:43:50.000
Hold tighter.

508
00:43:52.041 --> 00:43:52.958
Now what. asshole?

509
00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:55.583
Give me the key.

510
00:43:57.958 --> 00:43:59.625
You'd better give it to us.

511
00:44:01.666 --> 00:44:02.583
Son of a bitch.

512
00:44:03.166 --> 00:44:04.500
-Get him!
-You bastard.

513
00:44:05.916 --> 00:44:07.875
Go. Ramis! Get him!

514
00:44:09.833 --> 00:44:12.041
Asshole. The fucking key!

515
00:44:12.125 --> 00:44:14.500
-You fucking rat. where is it?
-I don't have it!

516
00:44:14.583 --> 00:44:15.416
The damn key!

517
00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:16.333
Where is it?

518
00:44:16.416 --> 00:44:18.250
-I don't have the key!
-What?

519
00:44:18.333 --> 00:44:19.583
Give me it.

520
00:44:19.666 --> 00:44:21.000
Fucking son of a bitch.

521
00:44:21.708 --> 00:44:22.875
I don't have it!

522
00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:33.958
What happened? Rumano!

523
00:44:36.625 --> 00:44:38.458
-Hey! What happened?
-Drop that!

524
00:44:38.541 --> 00:44:39.666
-Stay back!
-Easy!

525
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:41.750
-Shit. What have you done?
-Don't move!

526
00:44:41.833 --> 00:44:43.541
-Why did you do that?
-Drop it!

527
00:44:43.625 --> 00:44:45.041
-Shit.
-What have you done?

528
00:44:45.125 --> 00:44:47.666
-For fuck's sake. stay back!
-You killed him. man!

529
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:49.958
-That guy will kill us all!
-One question.

530
00:44:51.041 --> 00:44:51.958
Is he after you?

531
00:44:52.041 --> 00:44:53.500
We'll be safe in here!

532
00:44:53.583 --> 00:44:56.958
-He has the key. Give it to us!
-Stay back!

533
00:44:59.916 --> 00:45:00.750
Nano.

534
00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:03.833
I told you we'd meet again.

535
00:45:04.333 --> 00:45:06.500
-What the fuck?
-Quiet. Listen up.

536
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.875
I don't care who you are
or why you're here.

537
00:45:09.958 --> 00:45:11.958
Open the door and you can leave.

538
00:45:12.625 --> 00:45:13.875
I just came for him.

539
00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:16.666
Don't believe a word he's saying.

540
00:45:17.208 --> 00:45:18.500
He's a liar.

541
00:45:20.041 --> 00:45:21.666
Why is he after you. Nano?

542
00:45:23.625 --> 00:45:25.833
Listen. I haven't done anything. I swear.

543
00:45:27.166 --> 00:45:30.375
He's too scared to go after
the cops who fucked up his case.

544
00:45:30.458 --> 00:45:31.500
They're his buddies.

545
00:45:32.333 --> 00:45:33.750
I'm his scapegoat.

546
00:45:34.666 --> 00:45:37.416
No evidence. nothing. Shit. I'm innocent.

547
00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:39.375
What the fuck are you talking about?

548
00:45:39.458 --> 00:45:41.416
Are you saying this guy's a cop?

549
00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:45.666
That guy used to be
one of the most vicious cops I ever met.

550
00:45:46.333 --> 00:45:50.041
The guy got fired
because of all the shit he did. man.

551
00:45:50.541 --> 00:45:51.375
You know?

552
00:45:51.916 --> 00:45:54.208
Problem is. I always get in trouble. bro.

553
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.083
Know what I mean?

554
00:45:56.166 --> 00:45:58.875
Why are you so scared?
Don't fuck around. Nano.

555
00:45:58.958 --> 00:46:03.583
Think for a second. He tried to kill us!
He almost burned us alive! Can't you see?

556
00:46:04.666 --> 00:46:06.416
Ask the cop's partners.

557
00:46:07.208 --> 00:46:10.375
-How are they doing?
-I don't give a shit about them!

558
00:46:10.458 --> 00:46:13.833
You did something.
We're not paying for it. you hear me?

559
00:46:15.125 --> 00:46:17.541
Hand him over and you'll get out alive.

560
00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:20.625
Otherwise. you'll all die.

561
00:46:24.791 --> 00:46:26.625
He's watching us on the camera.

562
00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:31.333
Miguel!

563
00:46:33.083 --> 00:46:34.708
You're in way over your head!

564
00:46:35.708 --> 00:46:37.541
What the fuck are you doing. man?

565
00:46:39.208 --> 00:46:40.958
Ask your pal Chino.

566
00:46:44.958 --> 00:46:46.875
What did you do to Chino. you bastard?

567
00:46:47.833 --> 00:46:49.916
What did you do. you son of a bitch?

568
00:46:50.416 --> 00:46:53.791
-Put that down and go.
-No one leaves this place.

569
00:46:53.875 --> 00:46:55.000
-Got it?
-Drop that.

570
00:46:55.083 --> 00:46:58.625
Listen up. Miguel!
You need me alive. but I'm not leaving!

571
00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:00.583
-Bring it. Ramis.
-Stop.

572
00:47:00.666 --> 00:47:02.833
-Come on. Ramis!
-We'll do this nicely.

573
00:47:02.916 --> 00:47:04.375
-We're your friends!
-Drop it!

574
00:47:04.458 --> 00:47:05.958
Hey. man!

575
00:47:06.041 --> 00:47:07.500
The key. you son of a bitch.

576
00:47:07.583 --> 00:47:08.666
Leave me alone!

577
00:47:11.958 --> 00:47:12.833
Out of my way!

578
00:47:13.416 --> 00:47:15.333
Give us the fucking key now!

579
00:47:39.625 --> 00:47:42.166
-No!
-What are you doing?

580
00:47:42.833 --> 00:47:43.791
Pig!

581
00:51:21.916 --> 00:51:24.041
For a junkie. he messed you up good.

582
00:51:33.333 --> 00:51:35.083
We're locked in here. dude.

583
00:51:36.291 --> 00:51:37.666
He cut off the heating.

584
00:51:40.458 --> 00:51:42.500
We'll freeze in half an hour.

585
00:51:43.625 --> 00:51:44.500
Ramis!

586
00:51:44.583 --> 00:51:45.625
Fucking hell.

587
00:51:46.125 --> 00:51:47.166
Ramis!

588
00:51:49.416 --> 00:51:50.416
What's your plan?

589
00:51:50.916 --> 00:51:54.791
I say we rip his stomach open
and get the key out. right?

590
00:51:54.875 --> 00:51:59.125
-Give us the blade and we'll get out.
-A lockpick isn't a fucking scalpel.

591
00:51:59.625 --> 00:52:01.625
Have you ever seen inside a stomach?

592
00:52:01.708 --> 00:52:05.000
It's not a plastic bag.
It's disgusting. And it's not easy.

593
00:52:05.083 --> 00:52:07.000
Cut the crap. Let's find more layers.

594
00:52:10.166 --> 00:52:11.541
What the hell is this?

595
00:52:12.625 --> 00:52:14.416
Fuck me. What's this?

596
00:52:15.125 --> 00:52:16.708
What's that bastard up to?

597
00:52:17.208 --> 00:52:18.458
Son of a bitch.

598
00:52:18.541 --> 00:52:20.083
Now what. man?

599
00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:34.208
Here's the hold.

600
00:53:34.916 --> 00:53:38.375
-Come on. Let's get our bags.
-Hurry. We're freezing.

601
00:53:46.875 --> 00:53:48.000
I'm gonna negotiate.

602
00:53:49.958 --> 00:53:50.791
Ramis.

603
00:53:52.916 --> 00:53:54.041
Give me the walkie.

604
00:53:55.208 --> 00:53:56.791
This fucking pig…

605
00:53:56.875 --> 00:53:58.375
Let me talk to him. please.

606
00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:00.750
I'm not your friend anymore.

607
00:54:01.333 --> 00:54:03.041
Ramis!

608
00:54:03.125 --> 00:54:07.666
-You're running out of time. And so am I.
-It took you long enough. you bastard.

609
00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:09.166
What's up. pig?

610
00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:11.000
Miguel. It's Miguel. right?

611
00:54:11.583 --> 00:54:13.875
The kid and the cop are locked up.

612
00:54:14.375 --> 00:54:15.750
Yeah. I saw.

613
00:54:17.083 --> 00:54:20.833
The key… Did you see that?
He swallowed the only key. We're fucked.

614
00:54:20.916 --> 00:54:22.375
…the other one.

615
00:54:23.291 --> 00:54:24.125
It's your call.

616
00:54:24.666 --> 00:54:27.333
-Shall we slit him open?
-I need him alive.

617
00:54:31.833 --> 00:54:33.666
It's fucking freezing!

618
00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:37.666
We'll find a way to get out.
but we need time.

619
00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:41.666
-We'll find a way.
-Give me Nano and I'll let you go.

620
00:54:42.166 --> 00:54:43.666
All I want is justice.

621
00:54:46.958 --> 00:54:48.875
How do we know you'll keep your word?

622
00:54:49.583 --> 00:54:51.166
You'll just have to trust me.

623
00:54:53.666 --> 00:54:54.500
Miguel?

624
00:54:56.208 --> 00:54:57.291
Miguel?

625
00:55:06.625 --> 00:55:07.458
What's up?

626
00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:09.458
What did he say?

627
00:55:10.583 --> 00:55:13.083
Either we open this sardine tin.
or we're dead.

628
00:55:13.166 --> 00:55:14.958
-How?
-I don't know.

629
00:55:15.041 --> 00:55:17.000
I'll tell you when I find a weak spot.

630
00:56:10.958 --> 00:56:11.833
It's cool.

631
00:56:12.458 --> 00:56:14.333
Your ring. It's cool.

632
00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:17.750
It was my sister's.

633
00:56:22.958 --> 00:56:24.166
How long you got left?

634
00:56:25.791 --> 00:56:27.000
Nine years. bro.

635
00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:29.333
Until I get my first furlough.

636
00:56:29.958 --> 00:56:31.083
Shit. Rei.

637
00:56:32.041 --> 00:56:33.750
You must've done some serious shit.

638
00:56:34.458 --> 00:56:38.041
The son of a bitch that raped my sister.
I put him in a coma.

639
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.708
He'll never wake up again.

640
00:56:43.708 --> 00:56:45.041
No offense. Rei.

641
00:56:45.875 --> 00:56:47.416
Did that help your sister?

642
00:56:54.708 --> 00:56:56.500
Why did you kill Rumano. Nano?

643
00:56:57.833 --> 00:56:59.583
Your file isn't that bad.

644
00:57:02.083 --> 00:57:04.083
I had no choice. man.

645
00:57:05.625 --> 00:57:06.750
Right…

646
00:57:06.833 --> 00:57:09.250
If we let this psycho in. we're all dead.

647
00:57:12.125 --> 00:57:15.916
He visited me in prison
just to mess with my head.

648
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.583
He threatened me. you know?

649
00:57:19.666 --> 00:57:21.750
I have nothing to do with him. I swear.

650
00:57:23.333 --> 00:57:24.750
Why are you in the slammer?

651
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:27.833
Me?

652
00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:29.583
Can't you tell?

653
00:57:32.208 --> 00:57:34.708
Addiction. Rei. Goddamn addiction.

654
00:57:37.041 --> 00:57:39.083
My parents got sick of me and cut me off.

655
00:57:39.583 --> 00:57:41.208
So I had to start stealing.

656
00:57:45.208 --> 00:57:46.833
You know the rest.

657
00:57:49.875 --> 00:57:52.250
And who's Chino? Is he your friend?

658
00:57:53.875 --> 00:57:56.208
Yup. He's like a brother to me. you know?

659
00:58:01.041 --> 00:58:03.166
I grew up with him and his grandma.

660
00:58:04.291 --> 00:58:05.958
She was like a mother to me.

661
00:58:09.541 --> 00:58:11.333
The only family I've ever had.

662
00:58:12.791 --> 00:58:14.416
God damn it. man.

663
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.416
If anything fucking happened to them…

664
00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:24.750
Why did you say he needs you alive?

665
00:58:30.833 --> 00:58:32.250
Done with the sob stories?

666
00:58:33.083 --> 00:58:34.916
Let's blow this fucking truck up.

667
00:58:38.916 --> 00:58:40.750
We need a hero to go down there.

668
00:58:46.375 --> 00:58:48.500
Don't look at me. Get him to do it.

669
01:00:14.125 --> 01:00:15.208
3LM.

670
01:00:15.833 --> 01:00:17.208
3LM. Do you copy?

671
01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:21.541
3LM. Do you copy?

672
01:00:22.875 --> 01:00:24.250
We were attacked.

673
01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:25.916
On the road.

674
01:00:26.666 --> 01:00:28.333
I don't know where we are.

675
01:00:29.375 --> 01:00:31.083
During the transfer.

676
01:00:31.583 --> 01:00:33.291
I think they took the truck.

677
01:00:36.583 --> 01:00:38.416
Two officers are dead.

678
01:01:57.750 --> 01:02:02.166
POLICE RESUME SEARCH
FOR THE BODY OF SOLEDAD GARCÍA

679
01:02:17.208 --> 01:02:19.791
I'm freezing my balls off. man.

680
01:02:19.875 --> 01:02:21.083
Don't think about it. Rei

681
01:02:22.291 --> 01:02:23.125
Here you go.

682
01:02:24.208 --> 01:02:25.958
Find a loose nut or screw.

683
01:02:26.041 --> 01:02:27.791
-Hopefully you can pull this off.
-OK.

684
01:02:29.125 --> 01:02:30.291
I need the flashlight.

685
01:02:32.708 --> 01:02:33.541
Here I go.

686
01:02:43.166 --> 01:02:44.083
How's it going?

687
01:02:46.291 --> 01:02:47.125
Rei?

688
01:02:50.541 --> 01:02:51.666
Rei.

689
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:52.625
see anything?

690
01:02:56.791 --> 01:02:58.125
I think I see something.

691
01:02:58.625 --> 01:03:00.375
-Hang on.
-Like what?

692
01:03:02.458 --> 01:03:03.291
Rei?

693
01:03:04.791 --> 01:03:06.250
Answer. Rei!

694
01:03:06.916 --> 01:03:08.208
Like a cover. bro.

695
01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:10.333
Right there.

696
01:03:16.833 --> 01:03:17.666
Ramis!

697
01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:20.000
You won't crack it open.

698
01:03:20.625 --> 01:03:22.083
We'll see about that.

699
01:03:22.166 --> 01:03:24.166
Now the pig's a mechanic.

700
01:03:24.250 --> 01:03:26.083
If it were easy. we'd already be dead.

701
01:03:39.708 --> 01:03:41.583
Don't tell me I can't do it.

702
01:03:41.666 --> 01:03:43.166
I've heard that too much.

703
01:03:46.333 --> 01:03:47.791
You don't remember me. do you?

704
01:03:50.708 --> 01:03:51.708
How's your wife?

705
01:03:54.041 --> 01:03:55.125
Still married. right?

706
01:03:56.958 --> 01:03:58.541
She was hot as hell.

707
01:04:00.791 --> 01:04:02.375
Seemed like a really nice girl.

708
01:04:03.958 --> 01:04:06.000
What the fuck are you talking about?

709
01:04:08.166 --> 01:04:09.291
Relax. Jesus.

710
01:04:11.208 --> 01:04:12.416
It's not what you think.

711
01:04:13.416 --> 01:04:14.791
I sang at your wedding.

712
01:04:17.375 --> 01:04:18.583
From the flamenco band?

713
01:04:18.666 --> 01:04:20.166
Well. hold on.

714
01:04:20.250 --> 01:04:21.750
Rumba. Sevillana…

715
01:04:21.833 --> 01:04:25.458
I never dared
to sing proper flamenco in public.

716
01:04:25.541 --> 01:04:27.375
Seriously? You sang at a pig's wedding?

717
01:04:27.958 --> 01:04:28.791
Yes. So what?

718
01:04:30.625 --> 01:04:34.041
-Rei. did you hear that?
-This one came off. bro.

719
01:04:37.625 --> 01:04:39.958
-Now I remember you.
-Glad to hear that.

720
01:04:40.041 --> 01:04:42.166
-You sang?
-Not so much.

721
01:04:42.250 --> 01:04:44.625
But I was in a fucking good band.

722
01:04:45.625 --> 01:04:47.708
My uncle taught me to play guitar.

723
01:04:48.208 --> 01:04:50.291
I was better at picking locks.
What can I say?

724
01:04:51.166 --> 01:04:52.500
What a motherfucker.

725
01:04:53.083 --> 01:04:54.375
You know what they say.

726
01:04:55.208 --> 01:04:58.666
Only crooks and artists
lead interesting lives.

727
01:05:01.583 --> 01:05:03.000
You're making a mistake.

728
01:05:04.083 --> 01:05:05.333
That guy is a killer.

729
01:05:08.833 --> 01:05:11.500
I've never been this lucky
in my fucking life.

730
01:05:11.583 --> 01:05:13.000
And I won't waste it.

731
01:05:15.208 --> 01:05:16.833
You won't see me in jail again.

732
01:05:18.083 --> 01:05:19.291
I'll have my bar.

733
01:05:19.875 --> 01:05:22.125
Do you really think
you'll get away with this?

734
01:05:23.708 --> 01:05:24.791
Let 'em look for me.

735
01:05:28.375 --> 01:05:29.291
Ramis!

736
01:05:31.166 --> 01:05:32.125
Ramis!

737
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:34.750
Ramis!

738
01:06:36.416 --> 01:06:37.250
Shots?

739
01:06:46.291 --> 01:06:48.708
García! Stop the truck!

740
01:06:55.333 --> 01:06:56.250
Stop the truck!

741
01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:16.625
Pull over!

742
01:07:17.208 --> 01:07:18.833
You won't get away with this!

743
01:07:29.708 --> 01:07:31.166
García!

744
01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:32.666
I've called for backup!

745
01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:34.166
They're coming for you!

746
01:08:00.041 --> 01:08:01.291
Ramis! Fuck!

747
01:08:51.541 --> 01:08:52.375
Rei?

748
01:08:53.625 --> 01:08:54.500
Rei?

749
01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:56.583
Rei. are you OK?

750
01:09:00.708 --> 01:09:01.583
Rei?

751
01:09:02.541 --> 01:09:03.416
Rei?

752
01:09:09.583 --> 01:09:11.375
Ramis. what the fuck is going on?

753
01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:42.208
I can't take it anymore. Ramis.

754
01:10:43.041 --> 01:10:44.291
Son of a bitch.

755
01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:47.833
What does he want?

756
01:11:54.375 --> 01:11:56.583
We're moving.

757
01:12:16.791 --> 01:12:17.625
Miguel.

758
01:12:22.333 --> 01:12:23.166
Miguel.

759
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:27.500
What the fuck are you doing. man?
I told you we'd get out. didn't I?

760
01:12:27.583 --> 01:12:29.166
Miguel. you bastard!

761
01:12:36.708 --> 01:12:39.208
What now? How do we get out of here?

762
01:12:52.583 --> 01:12:53.416
Miguel?

763
01:12:56.166 --> 01:12:57.000
Miguel!

764
01:13:00.166 --> 01:13:01.291
The sun's rising.

765
01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:10.041
You're running out of time.

766
01:13:11.416 --> 01:13:12.250
Nano.

767
01:13:13.458 --> 01:13:14.625
It's your last chance.

768
01:13:20.583 --> 01:13:22.083
God fucking dammit. Nano.

769
01:13:22.750 --> 01:13:23.875
What does he want?

770
01:13:24.458 --> 01:13:25.833
Is he going to kill us?

771
01:13:25.916 --> 01:13:28.583
Tell him what he wants to know
and let us out.

772
01:13:28.666 --> 01:13:29.916
I said I don't know.

773
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:30.833
Miguel.

774
01:13:31.416 --> 01:13:32.250
Shit. Miguel.

775
01:13:32.750 --> 01:13:34.583
Listen to me. We've done our best.

776
01:13:35.250 --> 01:13:36.333
OK?

777
01:13:36.416 --> 01:13:37.583
What next?

778
01:13:37.666 --> 01:13:39.500
What are you going to do to us. man?

779
01:13:41.208 --> 01:13:42.041
Miguel?

780
01:13:43.083 --> 01:13:44.041
Miguel?

781
01:13:44.125 --> 01:13:46.166
Give me the damn walkie. Give it to me.

782
01:13:48.083 --> 01:13:48.916
Miguel.

783
01:13:50.208 --> 01:13:52.458
I don't know who you are.
but listen to me.

784
01:13:52.541 --> 01:13:55.375
I'm Martín. the officer in charge
of the truck. Got it?

785
01:13:56.416 --> 01:14:00.541
How far are you going to take this?
You won't get away with it. you hear me?

786
01:14:00.625 --> 01:14:01.875
I don't want to.

787
01:14:03.333 --> 01:14:04.500
I just want him.

788
01:14:05.625 --> 01:14:06.500
Why?

789
01:14:07.375 --> 01:14:08.500
Never mind why.

790
01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.541
I can't give you a man.
so you can kill him.

791
01:14:11.625 --> 01:14:13.458
That's not how the law works.

792
01:14:17.166 --> 01:14:18.000
Miguel?

793
01:14:18.083 --> 01:14:18.916
The law.

794
01:14:20.375 --> 01:14:22.500
Miguel?

795
01:14:59.250 --> 01:15:00.291
He stopped.

796
01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:44.500
What the fuck is going on?

797
01:16:47.875 --> 01:16:49.750
Shit. We closed it. didn't we?

798
01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:51.333
Fuck.

799
01:16:52.041 --> 01:16:54.000
-Kid!
-What's this? For God's sake!

800
01:16:54.875 --> 01:16:55.833
Fuck me.

801
01:16:56.375 --> 01:16:57.416
Guillermo!

802
01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:58.791
You son of a bitch!

803
01:17:03.541 --> 01:17:05.000
Motherfucker!

804
01:17:05.083 --> 01:17:06.666
Where the fuck is he taking us?

805
01:17:06.750 --> 01:17:07.791
You son of a bitch!

806
01:17:08.583 --> 01:17:09.916
I don't want to drown!

807
01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.250
-Open up. Ramis!
-Now what. Nano?

808
01:17:12.333 --> 01:17:13.166
Ramis!

809
01:17:14.083 --> 01:17:17.625
-You son of a bitch!
-Christ! The water's freezing!

810
01:17:18.666 --> 01:17:21.500
I'm not dying today. do you hear me?

811
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.041
Let's get out!

812
01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:32.916
Ramis!

813
01:17:33.541 --> 01:17:36.708
Ramis! Open the fucking door. god damn it!

814
01:17:37.291 --> 01:17:38.125
Ramis!

815
01:17:38.916 --> 01:17:40.416
Open the door!

816
01:17:40.916 --> 01:17:42.625
I know a way out! Open it!

817
01:17:43.458 --> 01:17:45.375
There's an emergency exit!

818
01:17:45.458 --> 01:17:46.375
Up there.

819
01:17:46.875 --> 01:17:49.208
-Up you go. Gollum!
-Open the damn door!

820
01:17:53.125 --> 01:17:53.958
Ramis!

821
01:18:00.375 --> 01:18:02.833
Quickly! Give me your hand. Ramis.

822
01:18:05.708 --> 01:18:06.541
Hold on to me.

823
01:18:07.041 --> 01:18:09.500
-Hold on.
-Give me your hand. Ramis.

824
01:18:14.666 --> 01:18:15.500
Up!

825
01:18:20.208 --> 01:18:21.041
Open the door.

826
01:18:21.583 --> 01:18:23.500
-Open up. Ramis.
-Wait. Listen.

827
01:18:24.458 --> 01:18:25.958
You say there's an exit. cop?

828
01:18:26.041 --> 01:18:27.666
A hidden exit in the back.

829
01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:28.875
Under the lights.

830
01:18:28.958 --> 01:18:32.041
-You should've told us before. asshole.
-He'd have killed us.

831
01:18:32.125 --> 01:18:35.750
-Open up and we'll get out then.
-Shut up a minute! Shit!

832
01:18:35.833 --> 01:18:36.708
Hold this.

833
01:18:38.875 --> 01:18:40.208
Go.

834
01:18:48.125 --> 01:18:49.458
-Shit.
-No!

835
01:18:55.083 --> 01:18:56.666
-Where is it?
-Fuck me!

836
01:18:57.291 --> 01:18:58.208
What now?

837
01:18:59.125 --> 01:19:01.000
I'll get it. Ramis.

838
01:19:01.083 --> 01:19:02.250
Are you crazy?

839
01:19:08.875 --> 01:19:09.750
Use the flashlight.

840
01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:12.166
-Here I go.
-Go on. Gollum. go!

841
01:19:37.958 --> 01:19:39.833
-Where is he?
-I don't know.

842
01:19:39.916 --> 01:19:42.041
What the hell's he doing down there?

843
01:19:49.791 --> 01:19:51.041
Come on. Gollum!

844
01:19:51.541 --> 01:19:53.125
For fuck's sake. come on.

845
01:19:53.666 --> 01:19:55.833
-Hold it straight.
-Give it to me!

846
01:19:56.333 --> 01:19:57.166
Ramis…

847
01:20:00.291 --> 01:20:01.750
Hurry. Ramis. Open up.

848
01:20:04.291 --> 01:20:06.291
Go when I say so. cop.

849
01:20:07.875 --> 01:20:09.625
Go down. OK?

850
01:20:13.958 --> 01:20:15.416
All right. Open it.

851
01:20:16.791 --> 01:20:17.625
Now!

852
01:20:18.666 --> 01:20:19.500
Let's go!

853
01:20:44.916 --> 01:20:46.833
Now what. cop? Which way?

854
01:20:46.916 --> 01:20:48.916
This key unlocks the exit.

855
01:20:49.583 --> 01:20:50.708
The water's rising.

856
01:20:53.666 --> 01:20:55.708
Gollum!

857
01:20:57.500 --> 01:20:58.916
Gollum…

858
01:20:59.958 --> 01:21:02.541
Gollum. buddy. What's up?

859
01:21:03.083 --> 01:21:03.916
Come on. man.

860
01:21:04.458 --> 01:21:05.666
Don't do this to me.

861
01:21:08.250 --> 01:21:11.625
Not now. OK? No.
Come on. buddy. Wake up.

862
01:21:11.708 --> 01:21:14.000
Wake up. Shit. say something.

863
01:21:14.083 --> 01:21:18.041
Wake up! Wake up. boy!
Hey. don't do this to me.

864
01:21:18.833 --> 01:21:20.625
Gollum!

865
01:21:36.958 --> 01:21:38.375
No…

866
01:21:38.458 --> 01:21:41.541
-There's nothing we can do. We need to go.
-Get off me. go.

867
01:21:52.958 --> 01:21:56.083
Come on. Ramis!
Let's get out of here! Come on!

868
01:22:06.208 --> 01:22:07.041
Ramis.

869
01:22:51.583 --> 01:22:52.958
Come on. damn it. Up.

870
01:22:59.458 --> 01:23:00.333
Cop…

871
01:24:15.291 --> 01:24:16.541
Jesus!

872
01:24:32.666 --> 01:24:33.500
Thank you.

873
01:24:54.375 --> 01:24:55.625
Where's Nano?

874
01:24:58.083 --> 01:24:59.333
No fucking idea.

875
01:25:02.375 --> 01:25:04.083
And the guy from the truck?

876
01:25:04.625 --> 01:25:07.333
What do I care? It's not our problem.

877
01:25:08.250 --> 01:25:09.625
At least. not mine.

878
01:25:13.458 --> 01:25:14.833
But maybe it's yours.

879
01:25:38.916 --> 01:25:39.958
Now what?

880
01:25:44.333 --> 01:25:45.500
What are you gonna do?

881
01:25:53.416 --> 01:25:55.291
What will you call your bar?

882
01:26:01.791 --> 01:26:03.000
The Fandango.

883
01:26:04.791 --> 01:26:06.333
After my uncle's bar.

884
01:26:07.291 --> 01:26:08.750
Maybe The Fandango II.

885
01:26:11.291 --> 01:26:14.000
It'll be the coolest bar
in the Dominican Republic.

886
01:26:14.666 --> 01:26:16.708
Bambino playing all day long.

887
01:26:17.208 --> 01:26:18.708
And tapas to die for.

888
01:26:22.250 --> 01:26:23.125
Good luck.

889
01:26:27.791 --> 01:26:29.208
Be careful with those pricks.

890
01:26:40.041 --> 01:26:41.583
It's fucking freezing.

891
01:28:09.041 --> 01:28:10.708
Son of a bitch.

892
01:28:27.833 --> 01:28:29.541
I have nothing against you.

893
01:28:30.375 --> 01:28:32.125
Leave now. and you'll be safe.

894
01:28:32.708 --> 01:28:34.708
-You can still turn yourself in.
-I will.

895
01:28:36.250 --> 01:28:37.958
I'll pay whatever price I need to.

896
01:28:38.541 --> 01:28:40.416
I know the price of what I've done.

897
01:28:41.041 --> 01:28:43.875
I've tried to do
as little damage as possible.

898
01:28:44.375 --> 01:28:45.583
What do you want from him?

899
01:28:47.291 --> 01:28:48.250
What do I want?

900
01:28:52.833 --> 01:28:53.875
Do you have kids?

901
01:28:56.250 --> 01:28:57.125
Two little girls.

902
01:29:05.041 --> 01:29:05.875
Children…

903
01:29:08.583 --> 01:29:10.333
take everything from you.

904
01:29:26.208 --> 01:29:27.625
It was the village festival.

905
01:29:29.416 --> 01:29:32.208
It was the first time we were going to let

906
01:29:32.708 --> 01:29:34.041
my daughter. Sole. go out.

907
01:29:35.041 --> 01:29:36.333
She was so excited.

908
01:29:37.708 --> 01:29:39.708
She'd planned to meet her friends.

909
01:29:41.166 --> 01:29:45.250
That week. they came over every day
to rehearse a dance together.

910
01:29:51.041 --> 01:29:53.291
Nano and his friend…

911
01:29:54.833 --> 01:29:56.541
bought her some shots.

912
01:29:57.458 --> 01:29:59.833
She'd never drunk. She didn't like it.

913
01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:03.625
I don't know how they convinced her.

914
01:30:15.375 --> 01:30:16.625
They raped her.

915
01:30:19.083 --> 01:30:20.083
First one.

916
01:30:21.333 --> 01:30:22.666
Then the other.

917
01:30:24.625 --> 01:30:26.791
Then both at the same time.

918
01:30:28.166 --> 01:30:29.291
Once they were done.

919
01:30:30.750 --> 01:30:32.333
they used cigarette butts.

920
01:30:32.416 --> 01:30:33.500
They used…

921
01:30:37.833 --> 01:30:39.541
They used pliers.

922
01:30:40.041 --> 01:30:41.125
A bottle.

923
01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:44.958
They did all sorts of stuff.

924
01:30:46.875 --> 01:30:47.916
All sorts of stuff.

925
01:30:52.333 --> 01:30:56.541
She was still alive when they tied her
to a car they'd stolen earlier that night.

926
01:30:57.666 --> 01:31:00.458
They dragged her through fields
for a good long while.

927
01:31:04.166 --> 01:31:09.875
You have to be really messed up
to do shit like that to a girl who's only

928
01:31:10.375 --> 01:31:11.333
13 years old.

929
01:31:15.166 --> 01:31:16.916
They dumped her body somewhere.

930
01:31:18.250 --> 01:31:19.333
No one knows where.

931
01:31:19.833 --> 01:31:22.500
A ditch… A well.

932
01:31:25.916 --> 01:31:28.166
Only Nano knows where she is.

933
01:31:40.958 --> 01:31:41.791
There was

934
01:31:43.166 --> 01:31:44.458
an investigation.

935
01:31:44.541 --> 01:31:46.500
but he was never charged.

936
01:31:46.583 --> 01:31:49.708
That kid's in and out of prison
every other day.

937
01:31:49.791 --> 01:31:51.333
But he got away with this.

938
01:31:53.750 --> 01:31:56.000
In a few months.
he'll be on the street again.

939
01:31:59.333 --> 01:32:01.041
The law doesn't work like that.

940
01:32:01.125 --> 01:32:03.083
I know how the fucking law works.

941
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.250
I was a policeman.

942
01:32:06.416 --> 01:32:09.458
Politicians wanted to take photos with me.

943
01:32:10.041 --> 01:32:14.666
Judges. teachers. and shrinks called me.
They thought I should meet other parents

944
01:32:15.250 --> 01:32:16.833
in similar situations.

945
01:32:19.250 --> 01:32:20.708
But I fly solo.

946
01:32:21.708 --> 01:32:23.916
I don't trust this shitty system.

947
01:32:24.666 --> 01:32:26.333
You've all failed me.

948
01:32:27.291 --> 01:32:28.166
But I won't fail.

949
01:32:44.416 --> 01:32:45.875
I'm nearly done.

950
01:32:46.583 --> 01:32:47.416
I swear.

951
01:32:48.541 --> 01:32:50.916
I just need to know where they tossed her.

952
01:32:51.416 --> 01:32:55.500
find her body.
and bury her alongside my parents.

953
01:32:56.458 --> 01:32:58.208
I promised my wife.

954
01:33:00.375 --> 01:33:03.166
I've tried everything
to get Nano to tell me.

955
01:33:03.833 --> 01:33:05.791
He's always denied being involved.

956
01:33:06.583 --> 01:33:07.916
How do you know he did it?

957
01:33:09.125 --> 01:33:10.541
What if you're wrong?

958
01:33:11.208 --> 01:33:13.791
His friend. Chino. told me
before I killed him.

959
01:33:15.375 --> 01:33:17.000
He confessed to everything.

960
01:33:22.416 --> 01:33:24.541
-I can't let you kill him.
-I know.

961
01:33:24.625 --> 01:33:26.208
I've walked in your shoes.

962
01:34:44.208 --> 01:34:45.041
Miguel.

963
01:34:49.791 --> 01:34:50.708
I had him.

964
01:34:54.666 --> 01:34:55.541
Miguel!

965
01:36:07.666 --> 01:36:08.500
Where is she?

966
01:36:09.708 --> 01:36:11.375
Where is she. you bastard?

967
01:36:11.875 --> 01:36:12.708
Tell me!

968
01:36:13.458 --> 01:36:14.958
-Tell me!
-Stop it!

969
01:36:16.916 --> 01:36:17.750
Where is she?

970
01:36:18.666 --> 01:36:19.500
Tell me where!

971
01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:20.958
Stop it!

972
01:36:21.041 --> 01:36:22.125
Where is she?

973
01:36:26.333 --> 01:36:27.541
You'll kill him.

974
01:36:38.583 --> 01:36:39.625
Stop.

975
01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.916
Hey! Miguel!

976
01:37:19.416 --> 01:37:21.375
I'll never fucking tell you!

977
01:37:23.166 --> 01:37:24.500
Do you hear me?

978
01:37:25.666 --> 01:37:27.500
You hear me. you clown?

979
01:38:25.041 --> 01:38:28.333
What are you doing? Get him. you dickhead!

980
01:38:29.041 --> 01:38:31.125
-What are you doing?
-Tell him.

981
01:38:32.708 --> 01:38:33.666
Martín. please.

982
01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:35.666
Martín. what are you doing. man?

983
01:38:36.250 --> 01:38:37.083
What the fuck?

984
01:38:37.875 --> 01:38:39.041
Tell him.

985
01:38:39.958 --> 01:38:41.541
Please. Martín. don't.

986
01:38:42.125 --> 01:38:43.125
Come on.

987
01:39:06.541 --> 01:39:07.625
Tell him.

988
01:39:12.416 --> 01:39:16.000
She's in the well!
In the well on the Pardeza farm!

989
01:39:16.583 --> 01:39:17.458
I swear!

990
01:39:18.083 --> 01:39:19.416
I swear to God!

991
01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.583
