00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.640
Mother!

4
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.480
Aren't I terrible?
I am.

5
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.120
Hey... Tinja. Stop!

6
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.160
Hey. No!
You're impossible!

7
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.480
I hope your everyday life
is as lovely as ours.

8
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.240
-Bye-bye!
-Bye-bye!

9
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.800
Bye!

10
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.640
Let's chase it to the window.

11
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.320
All right.

12
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.720
All right.

13
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.760
-Yay!
-Matias. Matias.

14
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.080
Catch it!

15
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.040
No!

16
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.640
Tinja.

17
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.640
-Shall I take it outside?
-Bring it here.

18
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.120
Let me see.

19
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.440
-Be careful. There's glass on the floor.
-Let me see--

20
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.320
Matias. let's go see...

21
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.280
Please take it to the trash. dear.

22
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.680
Organic waste.

23
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.760
HATCHING

24
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.160
Come. come. come.

25
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.720
-Hi! I'm Reetta.
-Tinja. Hi.

26
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.320
We just moved in.
I mean. duh. I'm sure you can tell.

27
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.400
-May I pet it?
-Sure.

28
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.480
Naughty! Roosa!

29
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.440
You can't do that.

30
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.480
I'm sorry.
She's never bitten anyone.

31
00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.160
-Did she hurt you?
-No. It was my fault.

32
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:09.560
<i>Ah. ah. ah. ah
Alli's child</i>

33
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.600
Sing it louder.
Mother. louder.

34
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.400
<i>Ah. ah. ah. ah
Alli's-</i>

35
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.400
Louder.

36
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.880
<i>...child</i>

37
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:31.280
<i>A little baby bird</i>

38
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:38.360
<i>Ah. ah. ah. ah
Alli's child</i>

39
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.720
<i>A little baby bird</i>

40
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:51.480
<i>No father
No mother</i>

41
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:57.840
<i>No one to take care of you</i>

42
00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:04.600
<i>No father
No mother</i>

43
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.200
He's asleep.

44
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.320
-Is that the new introduction video?
-Yes.

45
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.680
It's still a bit unfinished.

46
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:31.840
LOVELY EVERYDAY LIFE

47
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.680
Hi. welcome to my blog
Lovely Everyday Life.

48
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.680
I'll show you the everyday life
of an ordinary Finnish family

49
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.400
and how lovely it can be.

50
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.040
I'm a woman
with two children and one man.

51
00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.840
My lovely daughter Tinja.
a super gymnast.

52
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.560
<i>will soon have her first competition.</i>

53
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.840
<i>I'm nervous
but incredibly proud of her.</i>

54
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.360
What?

55
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.800
My toes weren't pointed.
They're like this.

56
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.280
They should be like this.

57
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.800
-I'll crop the video so they don't show.
-Okay.

58
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:36.160
-A new family moved in next door.
-That's nice.

59
00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.880
-Have you met them?
-Yes. I mean. their daughter Reetta.

60
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.320
She invited me over tomorrow.

61
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.560
She has a really cute dog.

62
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.320
You said you were going to focus
on the competition.

63
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.800
-Or have you changed your plan?
-No. I'm focusing on it.

64
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.280
I'll help you.

65
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.480
Go already.

66
00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.360
Good.

67
00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.000
-You still didn't do the flip at the end.
-Yeah.

68
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.240
You're hesitating.
You've gotta trust yourself.

69
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.520
-I'm sorry.
-You don't have to apologize.

70
00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.600
But I can't let you compete
if you can't do it.

71
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.840
-I can do it again.
-No more today.

72
00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.920
Take it easy now. okay?

73
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.720
-Tinja. are you coming?
-I have to go for a run.

74
00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.320
Don't go.

75
00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.320
Why did you even ask?
She wouldn't come anyway.

76
00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.560
Have fun!

77
00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.800
Hi. This is Tero.

78
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.320
-Hi.
-Hi.

79
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.200
Why don't you get out
of your gymnastics clothes. sweetie.

80
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:18.160
-Hi.
-Hi.

81
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.080
-How was practice?
-Really good.

82
00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:22.920
Good.

83
00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.600
I have a surprise for you.

84
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.760
-I love it.
-You've gotta shine in the competition.

85
00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.920
You saw us.

86
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:50.280
Sometimes adults have these...
special friends.

87
00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:56.240
-But what about Dad?
-Well... Dad is Dad.

88
00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.680
-You know what he's like.
-Yeah.

89
00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.520
How about we keep this between us?
All right?

90
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.880
I'm going away for a couple of days.

91
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.880
But remember. this is between us girls.

92
00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.320
Hi. It smells good in here.

93
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.920
Oh. my. it looks so beautiful here.

94
00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.320
Mother! Mother!
We made waffles for you.

95
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:05.520
Yeah. Okay. that's enough.

96
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.400
Hey. Matias. that's enough.

97
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.680
Great. Now both of our clothes
are ruined.

98
00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.640
-Did you have a nice business trip?
-Yes. it was lovely.

99
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:32.720
Hi.

100
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:38.360
-Well? What's up. Tinja?
-Nothing.

101
00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:47.000
-Did Mother tell you about the trip?
-Yeah.

102
00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:53.320
She said
it was a really good blog seminar.

103
00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.720
That's nice.

104
00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:00.000
-I bought a new one. Look.
-It's nice.

105
00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.080
Okay.

106
00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.120
-Good.
-Good job. Tinja.

107
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.120
You're getting there.

108
00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.760
There's still one spot
in the competition.

109
00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.480
And our last one.
What was your name?

110
00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:03.840
Reetta.

111
00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.240
-Hi!
-I can't believe this.

112
00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.840
Okay. Reetta. go.

113
00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.600
Yes. That was perfect.

114
00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.280
Yes. Let's do it again.

115
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.760
Yes. And again.

116
00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.320
And again.

117
00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.760
And again.

118
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.920
All right. Tinja.
Let's do it one more time.

119
00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.920
-I should lock up.
-We'll take care of it.

120
00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:10.600
-Don't overdo it. Tinja.
-I'm okay.

121
00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.400
Okay. let's do it one more time.

122
00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.080
Good. That's it.

123
00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.480
Tuck your pelvis in.
Straighten your back.

124
00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:29.480
Symmetrical arms. no hunched back.

125
00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.360
Remember your chin.
Good job. Tinja.

126
00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.960
You know. I was thinking
of live streaming the competition.

127
00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:07.120
Everything's okay.
I'll take care of you.

128
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.720
We had
a really authentic moment there.

129
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.680
People love them.

130
00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.560
Hey...

131
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.560
May I confess something?

132
00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.480
I think...

133
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.920
I'm in love.

134
00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.560
I mean...

135
00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:12.560
for so many years.
I've only given to people

136
00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.160
and thought
that's what women have to do.

137
00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.760
But this...

138
00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.520
This is just...

139
00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.880
Tero is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

140
00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.960
This is the first time in my life

141
00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:34.720
I feel that I really love someone.

142
00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:40.080
I have to see where it takes me.

143
00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:44.480
-Do you understand?
-Yes. of course.

144
00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.600
I knew you would.

145
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:54.560
Sweetie. I'll be away next weekend too.

146
00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.480
Tinja.

147
00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.760
Is everything okay?

148
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.160
What happened?

149
00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.160
Tinja.

150
00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.680
Tinja.

151
00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.320
What happened? Are you okay?

152
00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.800
A bird.

153
00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.480
A bird came in.

154
00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.360
I think it was wounded.

155
00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:00.160
-What kind of bird was it?
-I don't know.

156
00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.120
A really big one.

157
00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.440
What are you doing in there?

158
00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:27.560
-Go away!
-I have to pee.

159
00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:31.000
-Go outside.
-I'm scared.

160
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.480
Ouch. Tinja!

161
00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.040
Go away.

162
00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:53.200
<i>Ah. ah. ah. ah</i>

163
00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:57.000
<i>Alli's child</i>

164
00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:03.880
<i>Poor little orphan</i>

165
00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:11.840
<i>Ah. ah. ah. ah
Alli's child</i>

166
00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:19.240
<i>Poor little orphan</i>

167
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.200
-What's that smell?
-Tinja is a shithead.

168
00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:06.920
Matias. let's see what Tinja has to say.

169
00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:08.680
What?

170
00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:12.200
What are you...

171
00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:19.160
So... you didn't let Matias use
the bathroom last night.

172
00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.080
Tinja is a shithead.

173
00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:24.120
We didn't come here
looking for conflict.

174
00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:29.320
-Matias peed in his bed.
-Okay. I'll change the sheets.

175
00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:32.480
-Tinja went outside last night.
-What?

176
00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:36.760
-You did?
-No. Was there anything else?

177
00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:40.520
I guess not. I mean...

178
00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.000
Oh...

179
00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:49.360
Yes. Right.

180
00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:54.200
Yes. I see.

181
00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:56.480
Let's go.

182
00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:26.200
-Do you have a bird?
-No.

183
00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.920
I mean. we might get one.

184
00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:34.160
Why didn't you come today?

185
00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:38.120
-Where?
-To practice.

186
00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:40.880
I... I forgot.

187
00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.920
She's so weird.

188
00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.080
Do you want to walk home with me?

189
00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:57.240
Then a terrible storm started.
The waves were this high.

190
00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:00.920
They went like this.
It was unbelievable.

191
00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:13.480
Can you help me post these?

192
00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:21.000
-Roosa ran away last night.
-Oh.

193
00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:25.080
I mean. oh. no.

194
00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:31.760
MISSING: ROOSA

195
00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:36.360
Hi. There you are.

196
00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.520
Ta-dah.

197
00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:46.520
What did you bring me?

198
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:49.480
Thanks. This is really nice.

199
00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:54.080
-What did you bring me?
-Oh. honey. I didn't get you anything.

200
00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.960
Your beautiful hair is so tangled.

201
00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.120
Your hair has gotten so long.

202
00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.160
Matias.

203
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.120
What on earth...

204
00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:25.000
This is the neighbor's dog.
Tinja buried it.

205
00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:28.600
-Where did you dig it up?
-Tinja killed it.

206
00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:31.520
-Some animal mauled it.
-Tinja did it.

207
00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.640
-Matias. stop lying.
-Go to your room.

208
00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:37.600
Now!

209
00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:41.400
Tinja. Tinja.

210
00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.240
Tinja.

211
00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.680
What happened?

212
00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:07.840
Mother!

213
00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:11.560
You can't do that! Understand?

214
00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:12.920
Do you understand?

215
00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:17.720
-Who are you talking to?
-Myself.

216
00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.160
What...

217
00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:43.200
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

218
00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:50.640
-What's that smell?
-It's... It's the dog.

219
00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.960
-What is this?
-I don't know.

220
00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:07.720
Who did this? Matias?

221
00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:14.200
-Tell me.
-No. it was an accident.

222
00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:22.840
Mother. are you angry at me?

223
00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:28.720
I thought the competition was
as important to you as it is to me.

224
00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.320
I already told you no!

225
00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.720
Did you say "Alli"?

226
00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:00.640
Tinja.

227
00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.800
Alli.

228
00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.440
Are you cold?

229
00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:03.640
Tinja.

230
00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.640
Mother. Tinja is a monster!

231
00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:10.080
You had another nightmare.

232
00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:13.240
It wasn't a nightmare.
It's real.

233
00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:20.280
Hi.

234
00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.600
Look.

235
00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:12.200
You're beautiful.

236
00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:21.400
Thanks.

237
00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:24.600
-Then Reetta. Tinja. spot her.
-I don't need a spotter.

238
00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:32.480
That's it.

239
00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:39.000
I'll go see my old classmates.

240
00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:42.120
We haven't seen each other
in such a long time.

241
00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:43.800
I miss them so much.

242
00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:46.640
Did you find your dog already?

243
00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:49.800
Oh. no.

244
00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:55.000
-But. hey. you were really good.
-Thanks.

245
00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:57.280
Would you also like to be
in the competition?

246
00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:59.080
Yes. if I'm qualified.

247
00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:04.280
That means Tinja has to practice
super hard if she wants to beat you.

248
00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:05.520
Right. Tinja?

249
00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:22.640
-Do you want a ride?
-No. I'll walk.

250
00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:26.240
-I can take you home.
-I like walking. See you!

251
00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:09.080
Mother.

252
00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:10.520
Let's turn back.

253
00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:12.480
Mother. let's turn back.

254
00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:06.880
Tinja.

255
00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:09.080
What's the matter with you?

256
00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:17.680
Tinja.

257
00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:22.000
Everything's okay.

258
00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:25.320
I understand. I know.

259
00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:32.520
I was also very nervous
before my skating competitions.

260
00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:35.200
It was very stressful.

261
00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:38.000
Do you know the best way
to get rid of the stress?

262
00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:39.280
What?

263
00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:41.280
Winning the competition.

264
00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:44.520
Show everybody you're the best. right?

265
00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:50.200
If you know you're going to win.
they'll know it too.

266
00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:53.080
When you win.
you don't have to worry about anything.

267
00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.240
I have an idea.

268
00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:03.280
Being home is
clearly very stressful for you.

269
00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:07.720
So why don't we spend the weekend
at Tero's?

270
00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:09.360
What do you say?

271
00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:15.320
Alli!

272
00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:46.280
Here you go.

273
00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:50.200
Have you lost weight?

274
00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:53.560
You've gotten rid
of the last bits of baby fat.

275
00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:58.200
When you're done eating. get ready.

276
00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.640
We'll go to Tero's house. you and me.

277
00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:22.520
Your mother is so strong-willed.

278
00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:30.840
I've always respected
her knowing what she wants.

279
00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:38.200
-It's easy being with someone like that.
-Yeah.

280
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.760
Tero is a good man.

281
00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:46.640
I mean. person.

282
00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:37.600
Isn't this lovely?

283
00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:01.040
Oh. hi.

284
00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:03.560
Nice to meet you.

285
00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:06.560
I mean. we saw each other already.

286
00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:09.200
But it's great you could come.

287
00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:16.400
-You look identical.
-Mother has such a great style.

288
00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:18.240
That's true.

289
00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:22.600
Welcome and make yourself at home.

290
00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:24.680
Isn't this a lovely house?

291
00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:26.800
It's a bit of a fixer-upper. but...

292
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.280
Hi.

293
00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:32.480
Do you want to see your room?

294
00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:36.680
Let's go meet Helmi first.

295
00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:39.200
Come. let's go.

296
00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:49.160
Who do we have here?

297
00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:53.720
Isn't she sweet?

298
00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:57.560
A little princess.

299
00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:01.200
You're so well-behaved and beautiful.

300
00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:04.880
Tero is a widower.

301
00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:07.200
Helmi's mother died in childbirth.

302
00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:09.640
But you have us now. don't you?

303
00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:11.000
Yeah.

304
00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:13.960
Oh.

305
00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:19.000
Everything's okay.

306
00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:25.680
Move your hands into the shot.

307
00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:28.680
That's it.

308
00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:31.520
Do you really have to photograph
everything?

309
00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:35.920
I might not want to show my house
to the whole world.

310
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.360
No one will know I took these here.

311
00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:40.720
Look. I cropped you out.

312
00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:47.040
Are you a sweet little princess?
Are you?

313
00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:49.960
Here we go. Let's put this on you.

314
00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:54.360
You're so cute in this lovely outfit.

315
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.400
Yes. you are.

316
00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:04.000
Hi.

317
00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:08.360
Yes?

318
00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:11.160
Eat. by all means.

319
00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:14.520
Yes.

320
00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:19.360
Where?

321
00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:27.840
-You like it?
-Yeah.

322
00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:32.480
Oh. don't worry about it.

323
00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:37.160
Look. What if I do like this?

324
00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:38.640
-Oops.
-Yeah.

325
00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:40.800
Oh. my gosh.

326
00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:45.720
Helmi. let's show her our table manners.

327
00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:47.560
Oops.

328
00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:51.720
I see. I mean. that's terrible.

329
00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:27.760
Reetta.

330
00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:54.400
That's so awful.
with the competition coming and all.

331
00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:58.840
But the most important thing
is that you don't let this affect you.

332
00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:27.520
Why did you do that? Why?

333
00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:45.440
Let me go. Alli!

334
00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:46.840
Let me go!

335
00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:05.960
What's on your mind?

336
00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:09.440
I was just looking at the chair.

337
00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:12.840
-It's nice.
-Yeah. I found it in a dumpster.

338
00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:16.720
People don't treat their things well.

339
00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:22.120
I like fixing them.
broken things like this.

340
00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:28.440
Hey. Um...

341
00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:33.160
I was going to give you these later.

342
00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:37.200
but I'll give them to you now.
since the competition is coming and all.

343
00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:38.760
Thank you.

344
00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:45.960
This is a cartwheel.

345
00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:53.440
This is an aerial cartwheel.

346
00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:00.800
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

347
00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:04.280
Wait. I'll do it again.

348
00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:13.800
-I can do better.
-You don't have to do it now.

349
00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:23.640
-I can do better.
-It doesn't matter.

350
00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:25.400
What do you mean?

351
00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:28.320
Tinja. do you really like gymnastics?

352
00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:31.480
-It's a good sport.
-Yes...

353
00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:36.480
I guess it's important for your mother
that you do well in it.

354
00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:40.520
Hey...

355
00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:44.400
Do you want to see me do a cartwheel?

356
00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:58.880
-What was that?
-I'll go change.

357
01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:30.920
Is everything okay?

358
01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:44.240
Tinja. open the door.

359
01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.080
Tinja...

360
01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:02.160
Why don't I call your mother now?

361
01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:10.320
Tinja! Tinja!

362
01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:13.440
Open the door!

363
01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.160
Let go!

364
01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:24.760
No! Stop!

365
01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:38.200
Do you have anything to say?

366
01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.520
I packed already.

367
01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:45.400
I can leave when Mother comes or...

368
01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:51.960
I can take the bus home if you want.

369
01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:55.720
You'll never have to see me again.

370
01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:05.000
No one's going anywhere now.

371
01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.160
You must think I'm a horrible person.

372
01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:09.920
You're not a horrible person.

373
01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:13.120
I mean. you were a bit a moment ago.

374
01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.880
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

375
01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:16.240
Hey.

376
01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:18.920
It's okay.

377
01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:21.920
Apology accepted.

378
01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:29.560
Maybe you've had a bit too much
to process lately.

379
01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:37.600
-We'll talk about this with your mother.
-No. don't tell her.

380
01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:41.480
Don't say anything to her.
I'll do anything.

381
01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:46.640
Was that because of the competition?

382
01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:51.760
No. I mean...

383
01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.280
You can tell me.

384
01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:02.280
Hi! Are you ready?

385
01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:06.240
Let's check your poses.
and then we'll go.

386
01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:09.720
I'll start filming
when you start stretching.

387
01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:13.120
What happened to your hand?

388
01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:18.000
I had an accident in the workshop.

389
01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:21.520
Honey. I've told you to be careful
with your tools.

390
01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.640
All right. let's go.

391
01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:28.920
Remember to point your toes
like you showed me.

392
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.640
Cover your ears.

393
01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:36.880
Hey. seriously.

394
01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:39.880
Tinja. you can do better. Hey.

395
01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:49.760
Tinja. it's only a question of focus.

396
01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:54.120
I'm sorry. honey.

397
01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:56.400
Did we wake you up?

398
01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:02.360
Was Tinja too loud? Was she?

399
01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:07.760
Who's Mother's darling baby? Who?

400
01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:09.280
Who?

401
01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:14.200
All right. Tinja. we gotta go.

402
01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:18.160
Good luck!

403
01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:20.240
Are you... Isn't Helmi coming?

404
01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:22.120
No. Tero and Helmi will stay here.

405
01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:25.640
-Helmi has to come with us.
-Tinja. we're in a hurry.

406
01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:29.400
-Helmi has to come with us.
-We'll be late for the competition.

407
01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:32.080
We need to talk.

408
01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:35.840
Tinja. say bye to Helmi.

409
01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:37.440
Bye bye. Helmi.

410
01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:14.760
Please go sit in the audience.

411
01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:17.880
Tinja.

412
01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:30.240
Matias.

413
01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:52.280
Alli. don't. Alli. don't.

414
01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:53.480
Alli. don't.

415
01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:56.760
You're last. Bring it.

416
01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:04.400
Tinja.

417
01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:29.000
-Does this hurt?
-No.

418
01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:31.400
I don't think it's fractured.

419
01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:36.480
Let's go.

420
01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:41.440
Her wrist?

421
01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:04.240
-Tero.
-Shut up.

422
01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:06.040
Tero. what are you--

423
01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:08.080
Do you understand
what your daughter has done?

424
01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:10.000
Tinja?
When?

425
01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:12.080
Now. A moment ago.

426
01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:13.960
We just came from the competition.

427
01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:18.080
Have you been drinking?

428
01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:23.040
-Go to hell.
-Why are you talking like that?

429
01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.880
I said we were at the competition.

430
01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:28.640
I don't care where you were.
but you're not coming here.

431
01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:32.520
-What?
-You only see yourself. huh?

432
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.360
Your daughter has
some serious problems.

433
01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:37.280
and I want nothing to do with them.

434
01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:40.640
Wait here.

435
01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:43.080
Tero.

436
01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:50.520
Where are you?

437
01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:18.840
Mother.

438
01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:53.480
I wished you would
at least let me be happy.

439
01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:31.680
What are you doing home so early?

440
01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:33.680
What?

441
01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:36.480
-Well. Tinja insisted.
-What--

442
01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:46.240
You lost.

443
01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:51.320
It's good to have you home.

444
01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:17.880
Go away.

445
01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:24.000
No. Don't.

446
01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:27.320
I want you to stop doing things.

447
01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:40.920
Tinja.

448
01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:43.880
What are you doing there?

449
01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:05.040
Hi. everyone.

450
01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:07.880
I just wanted to do an update

451
01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:11.400
since my live broadcast ended
so dramatically.

452
01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.400
Hi. everyone.

453
01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:21.280
Tinja is doing well.

454
01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:25.760
and we want to thank you.
every one of you.

455
01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:28.240
for your loving messages and support

456
01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:32.400
and for being so wonderful to us.

457
01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:34.640
You're part of our family.

458
01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:44.120
Hi. everyone.

459
01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:48.480
I know I always say
how lovely everything is.

460
01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:54.400
but an equally important part
of our everyday lives is failing.

461
01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:01.960
Mother.

462
01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:05.720
What?

463
01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:11.080
I can be better. I can do it.

464
01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:12.880
You smell.

465
01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:25.800
Tinja.

466
01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.640
What are you doing here?

467
01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:49.880
Come. I need you.

468
01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:57.640
Your hair looks terrible.

469
01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:02.800
Look at yourself.

470
01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:10.400
How can you be so disgusting?

471
01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:50.680
Tinja. let go of me!

472
01:14:57.320 --> 01:15:01.800
Tinja. Tinja. Let go!

473
01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:28.680
Go away!

474
01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:31.960
You hear me? Leave!

475
01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:34.840
I don't want you!

476
01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.360
No one wants you!

477
01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:11.200
What...

478
01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:14.680
What was that?

479
01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:18.520
I... I hatched it.

480
01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:22.520
Everything's its fault.

481
01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:27.800
I just want it to go away.

482
01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:35.040
Oh. baby.

483
01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:42.880
Mother's sweet little girl.

484
01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:46.320
Mother's darling.

485
01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:07.240
Is everything okay?

486
01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:15.760
There's someone here.

487
01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:17.720
Don't ask what.

488
01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:23.160
It looks like Tinja. but it's not Tinja.

489
01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:26.800
Everything is its fault.

490
01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:29.800
We'll take care of it.
and everything will be okay.

491
01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:33.840
-It wasn't a nightmare.
-You're right. honey.

492
01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:36.680
Keep an eye on Matias.

493
01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:44.160
No!

494
01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:58.120
Mother.

495
01:19:58.680 --> 01:19:59.800
We got it.

496
01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:05.400
What are you going to do?

497
01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:08.360
You wanted to get rid of it. didn't you?

498
01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:11.640
Yes. but...

499
01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:26.960
I hatched it.

500
01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:30.360
Everything will be okay.

501
01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:33.040
No!

502
01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:07.200
No. No. No. No.

503
01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:27.720
Tinja.

504
01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:16.640
Moth-er.
