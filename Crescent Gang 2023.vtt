3
00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:10.704
We're gonna get
your family a new house.

4
00:01:47.375 --> 00:01:49.577
Look like y'all had
a good last day of school.

5
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.212
Yes. ma'am.
- Mm-hmm. Homework?

6
00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:53.747
No.
- Carleigh. guess what?

7
00:01:56.184 --> 00:01:57.551
What's so funny?

8
00:01:57.685 --> 00:01:59.253
All right.
stop all that foolishness.

9
00:01:59.387 --> 00:02:01.322
Let's get in the house.
You know your chores.

10
00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:04.458
and they need to be done today.
Laugh at that.

11
00:02:04.592 --> 00:02:06.994
I didn't get to finish my news.

12
00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:08.662
That's all right.
You can tell me.

13
00:02:08.796 --> 00:02:10.998
- But I already told you.
No whining.

14
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:13.667
- Come in.
- Okay.

15
00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:43.831
I really
wish I could take her.

16
00:02:44.832 --> 00:02:46.634
We understand.
Mr. Matthews.

17
00:02:46.767 --> 00:02:49.537
Sometimes these things
just happen.

18
00:03:02.783 --> 00:03:04.552
Liberty. baby?

19
00:03:04.685 --> 00:03:06.720
I have somebody here
I want you to meet.

20
00:03:06.854 --> 00:03:09.857
Hello. Liberty.
I'm Mrs. Baker.

21
00:03:13.093 --> 00:03:15.629
I'm here to take you
to your new home.

22
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.399
I'm not going with you.

23
00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:21.302
Grandpa?

24
00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:22.503
Baby...

25
00:03:23.304 --> 00:03:24.638
because of my condition.

26
00:03:25.306 --> 00:03:26.874
the state
won't let me take you.

27
00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.512
Liberty.
I'm taking you to a home

28
00:03:31.645 --> 00:03:34.147
where there's kids your age.

29
00:03:34.848 --> 00:03:36.884
until I can find you
a permanent home.

30
00:03:37.017 --> 00:03:38.552
Now?

31
00:03:39.287 --> 00:03:40.354
Yes. now.

32
00:03:47.828 --> 00:03:51.532
She's taking their deaths
and all of this extremely well.

33
00:03:51.665 --> 00:03:52.933
Yes.

34
00:03:53.401 --> 00:03:55.269
She has the strength
that my daughter had.

35
00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:18.852
Liberty. you're really
gonna like your new home.

36
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.889
I liked my old home.

37
00:05:22.656 --> 00:05:24.358
What was that?

38
00:05:26.927 --> 00:05:28.295
Nothing.

39
00:05:34.234 --> 00:05:36.269
- Oh. my God! I forgot!
- Forgot what?

40
00:05:36.404 --> 00:05:37.705
I've gotta
exchange these girls.

41
00:05:37.838 --> 00:05:40.340
- What? Exchange?
- Is exchange what I said?

42
00:05:40.474 --> 00:05:41.975
Then exchange is what I meant.

43
00:05:42.109 --> 00:05:44.512
Kids. get up.
You go upstairs and pack.

44
00:05:44.645 --> 00:05:45.813
Get dressed!

45
00:05:53.421 --> 00:05:55.355
<i>This just in from
the Crescent House.</i>

46
00:05:55.489 --> 00:05:57.525
<i>We have a new girl coming.
That's all I know right now.</i>

47
00:05:57.658 --> 00:05:59.359
<i>Ms. Kay says she forgot.</i>

48
00:05:59.493 --> 00:06:01.061
<i>Get dressed! Now!</i>

49
00:06:34.628 --> 00:06:36.196
Is anybody home?

50
00:06:42.903 --> 00:06:44.705
Oh. hi!

51
00:06:44.838 --> 00:06:46.406
You must be Liberty!

52
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.642
Liberty.
this is your house mother.

53
00:06:49.176 --> 00:06:50.744
You can call me Mom.

54
00:06:52.079 --> 00:06:54.214
Okay. Well. come in.

55
00:06:58.018 --> 00:06:59.520
Um...

56
00:07:04.391 --> 00:07:05.893
Sorry about that.

57
00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:14.735
All right. let me introduce you
to my other children.

58
00:07:14.868 --> 00:07:17.705
- This is Carleigh.
- How you do?

59
00:07:18.572 --> 00:07:20.874
This is her adorable
little brother. Kyle.

60
00:07:24.377 --> 00:07:26.480
This is Haven.
She's our wiz kid.

61
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.716
Wiz kid?

62
00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:30.083
This is Michael.

63
00:07:31.719 --> 00:07:34.221
- Hello. my love.
Okay.

64
00:07:34.354 --> 00:07:36.724
Kids. No...

65
00:07:36.857 --> 00:07:40.628
All right. next we have Lailah
and Daisy. They're sisters.

66
00:07:41.529 --> 00:07:44.097
You aren't coming from
another foster home. are you?

67
00:07:47.601 --> 00:07:49.136
- Does she talk?
- Yes.

68
00:07:49.269 --> 00:07:52.072
She's just tired and shy.
I'm sure.

69
00:07:52.205 --> 00:07:54.842
Daisy. did you have
something to say to Liberty?

70
00:07:54.975 --> 00:07:57.244
<i>I pledge of allegiance
to the flag</i>

71
00:07:57.377 --> 00:07:59.913
<i>of the United States
of America.</i>

72
00:08:02.115 --> 00:08:03.450
And we're good.

73
00:08:03.584 --> 00:08:04.752
But what about Mr. Pierce?

74
00:08:04.885 --> 00:08:05.986
Who?
- Mr. Pierce?

75
00:08:06.119 --> 00:08:07.655
Yeah. Mr. Pierce.

76
00:08:07.788 --> 00:08:09.623
He is our part-time associate.

77
00:08:09.757 --> 00:08:11.759
How you guys doing?
Liberty. right?

78
00:08:11.892 --> 00:08:13.293
Welcome to Crescent House.

79
00:08:15.929 --> 00:08:16.997
We're good?

80
00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:20.968
Liberty. Ms. Kay is gonna take
really good care of you. okay?

81
00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:24.672
It's gonna be great.
I'll take it from here.

82
00:08:24.805 --> 00:08:26.306
Okay. You're taking
this one with you.

83
00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:27.474
Okay.

84
00:08:27.608 --> 00:08:29.643
You? All right.

85
00:08:30.944 --> 00:08:32.179
We're good?

86
00:08:39.753 --> 00:08:41.154
Is everything okay?

87
00:08:42.623 --> 00:08:44.357
You know. you can talk to me.

88
00:08:56.036 --> 00:08:58.038
Come in.

89
00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:01.174
Oh. Ms. Baker. Come in.

90
00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:04.845
This place kind of
smells stinkin' weird.

91
00:09:04.978 --> 00:09:06.980
Kind of like corn chips.

92
00:09:07.514 --> 00:09:09.717
This is my little assistant. Rose.

93
00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:10.984
Take a seat.

94
00:09:20.027 --> 00:09:22.195
Okay.
I'm sure that wasn't easy.

95
00:09:23.463 --> 00:09:26.033
The child has family.
Living family.

96
00:09:26.166 --> 00:09:28.335
Old or not.
we should've kept them together.

97
00:09:28.468 --> 00:09:31.404
but... what is done is done.

98
00:09:31.538 --> 00:09:34.507
Listen. you have
a job to do and so do I.

99
00:09:34.642 --> 00:09:36.910
And while I'm here.
it's my job to make sure

100
00:09:37.044 --> 00:09:39.412
the children are placed
in the best situation possible.

101
00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:41.414
You've seen her grandparents.

102
00:09:41.548 --> 00:09:43.183
A child can't live
in a nursing home.

103
00:09:43.817 --> 00:09:44.918
While you're here?

104
00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:47.220
It sounds like
you're already leaving.

105
00:09:47.354 --> 00:09:48.856
I see it time and time again.

106
00:09:48.989 --> 00:09:51.291
Young. hotshot lawyers like you

107
00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:54.594
do your bid working for
the state in family law.

108
00:09:54.728 --> 00:09:56.630
only to go work
for a private law firm

109
00:09:56.764 --> 00:09:58.231
after a couple of years.

110
00:09:58.365 --> 00:10:00.600
These cases. these kids.

111
00:10:00.734 --> 00:10:03.203
they deserve more than
to be your stepping stone.

112
00:10:04.371 --> 00:10:06.106
You don't know anything
about me. Mrs. Baker.

113
00:10:06.239 --> 00:10:07.307
or my story.

114
00:10:12.012 --> 00:10:14.047
I'm sorry.
I've got to take this.

115
00:10:20.353 --> 00:10:21.421
Reena Jeffcoat.

116
00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:24.457
In 20 minutes?

117
00:10:25.693 --> 00:10:28.495
Uh. yeah. I just--
I wasn't prepared for

118
00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:29.963
such a fast turnaround.

119
00:10:30.864 --> 00:10:32.399
No. no. no worries.
I'll make it work.

120
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:33.967
Okay. Bye-bye.

121
00:10:41.074 --> 00:10:42.910
Yes!

122
00:10:50.383 --> 00:10:51.484
Good morning.

123
00:10:55.088 --> 00:10:56.156
Excuse me.

124
00:11:02.229 --> 00:11:03.596
That should do it.

125
00:11:04.431 --> 00:11:06.333
- How can I help you?
- Hi. I'm Mrs. Jeffcoat.

126
00:11:06.466 --> 00:11:10.203
- I'm here for an interview.
- Uh. yes.

127
00:11:10.337 --> 00:11:12.605
Mrs. Jeffcoat here
for Dr. Evans.

128
00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.642
I'm sorry. I wasn't aware
I was gonna be meet--

129
00:11:15.776 --> 00:11:17.644
Is that gonna be a problem?

130
00:11:17.778 --> 00:11:19.646
Well. no. I just--
- Good. Follow me.

131
00:11:33.493 --> 00:11:34.895
They'll be with you shortly.

132
00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:40.133
Oh-kay.

133
00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:55.648
Thank you.

134
00:12:02.189 --> 00:12:05.993
Do you know Diane Hyatt?

135
00:12:06.126 --> 00:12:07.360
The Hyatts?

136
00:12:08.461 --> 00:12:09.529
Do you?

137
00:12:10.831 --> 00:12:12.900
Yes. of course.

138
00:12:13.033 --> 00:12:14.768
Mrs. Hyatt was rated

139
00:12:14.902 --> 00:12:17.771
<i>Forbes</i> West Coast
Businesswoman of the Year.

140
00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:22.075
Yeah. You know your stuff.

141
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:25.012
I knew you would.

142
00:12:25.979 --> 00:12:31.284
We are now the attorneys
of record for Diane Hyatt.

143
00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:33.520
All things Diane Hyatt.

144
00:12:34.154 --> 00:12:37.124
including
her high-profile divorce.

145
00:12:38.691 --> 00:12:40.460
Wait. The Hyatts...

146
00:12:41.528 --> 00:12:45.032
Vegas's number-one power couple
is getting a divorce?

147
00:12:45.899 --> 00:12:48.368
We're filing
the paperwork Friday

148
00:12:48.501 --> 00:12:49.903
from this office.

149
00:12:51.704 --> 00:12:53.640
And that is why we need you.

150
00:12:54.674 --> 00:12:56.910
Look. I'm sorry.

151
00:12:57.044 --> 00:13:01.081
Even with the utmost
confidence in my abilities.

152
00:13:01.214 --> 00:13:04.617
I'm not sure I can help you
with such a high-profile case.

153
00:13:06.053 --> 00:13:08.922
As you know. our office
is out of Los Angeles.

154
00:13:09.056 --> 00:13:11.458
And the Vegas office.
it's been doing well.

155
00:13:11.591 --> 00:13:14.061
but we need someone homegrown.

156
00:13:14.761 --> 00:13:18.465
We need someone local who
really knows the courts here.

157
00:13:20.767 --> 00:13:23.904
Mrs. Hyatt insisted
that we'd have someone local.

158
00:13:25.205 --> 00:13:27.807
Ms. Hyatt and Mr. Hyatt
have a daughter.

159
00:13:27.941 --> 00:13:29.109
Her name is Hillary.

160
00:13:29.742 --> 00:13:31.411
And Mr. Hyatt
is going to be filing

161
00:13:31.544 --> 00:13:33.981
for joint or full custody.

162
00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:36.583
So we need you.

163
00:13:37.384 --> 00:13:41.121
We need someone that can prove
that he is an unfit dad.

164
00:13:44.757 --> 00:13:46.526
Based on your file...

165
00:13:47.895 --> 00:13:49.662
you can make
something like that happen.

166
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.432
I've read your whole file.

167
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.667
While working
as a state attorney.

168
00:13:54.801 --> 00:13:58.271
you've tried
over 100 family cases.

169
00:13:59.106 --> 00:14:00.874
In a third of those cases.

170
00:14:01.008 --> 00:14:04.277
the parent or the guardian
was deemed unfit.

171
00:14:04.411 --> 00:14:06.679
No. those were
legitimate situations

172
00:14:06.813 --> 00:14:08.781
where the child was
better off in a group home

173
00:14:08.916 --> 00:14:10.350
under the state's care.

174
00:14:10.483 --> 00:14:11.551
Ah. well...

175
00:14:12.619 --> 00:14:14.121
I-- I understand.

176
00:14:14.254 --> 00:14:16.389
I'm not accusing you
of anything.

177
00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:18.491
All I'm saying is.

178
00:14:18.625 --> 00:14:22.195
if anyone were to know
someone was unfit...

179
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:24.531
it would be you.

180
00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:27.234
What are you making a year?

181
00:14:28.168 --> 00:14:30.670
50.000? 60.000?

182
00:14:31.638 --> 00:14:32.906
Hmm. About that?

183
00:14:35.008 --> 00:14:37.177
250.000 a year.

184
00:14:38.278 --> 00:14:42.983
Full benefits. company car.
entertainment stipend.

185
00:14:46.987 --> 00:14:49.056
If everything goes well.

186
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:51.491
we are looking
to make you...

187
00:14:52.825 --> 00:14:55.528
a junior partner
here at the Vegas office.

188
00:14:59.866 --> 00:15:03.570
Wow.
That's. like. a dream come true.

189
00:15:03.703 --> 00:15:04.771
Seriously.

190
00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:08.508
Take the day
and think about it.

191
00:15:09.076 --> 00:15:11.244
You don't have to
let me know anything soon.

192
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.716
Well. but when do I need
to let you know by?

193
00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.953
I'm filing the paperwork
Friday at 4:00 p.m.

194
00:15:20.087 --> 00:15:22.255
So you have until then.

195
00:15:29.696 --> 00:15:30.730
Let me know.

196
00:15:47.047 --> 00:15:48.481
Thank you.

197
00:15:51.118 --> 00:15:53.486
This would be a great
opportunity for our family.

198
00:15:54.121 --> 00:15:55.755
And you always said
the state's office

199
00:15:55.888 --> 00:15:57.924
was a stepping stone
for a private sector.

200
00:15:58.058 --> 00:16:00.460
I don't-- It--
it really is a no-brainer.

201
00:16:00.593 --> 00:16:02.762
I just-- I don't even know
why I'm asking.

202
00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:06.899
Hey. we've saved and done
what we said we were gonna do.

203
00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:09.269
Everything is going
according to plan.

204
00:16:10.203 --> 00:16:11.271
Yeah. I just--

205
00:16:11.904 --> 00:16:13.473
Mrs. Baker said
something to me today.

206
00:16:13.606 --> 00:16:16.243
and I don't know why.
it just rubbed me wrong.

207
00:16:16.909 --> 00:16:18.911
Mrs. Baker's been working
in foster care and adoption

208
00:16:19.046 --> 00:16:20.113
too long.

209
00:16:20.747 --> 00:16:22.249
Can't let her pessimism
affect you.

210
00:16:22.882 --> 00:16:25.118
And that's the thing. She
wasn't even being pessimistic.

211
00:16:25.252 --> 00:16:28.821
Just.
she had this sense of. like--

212
00:16:29.622 --> 00:16:30.690
What is it?

213
00:16:31.924 --> 00:16:32.992
Hope.

214
00:16:48.475 --> 00:16:51.844
We are back to <i>Live with Daisy.</i>
and it's me. Daisy.

215
00:16:51.978 --> 00:16:54.047
We are live on location
at the Crescent House

216
00:16:54.181 --> 00:16:56.116
with our new roomie. Liberty.

217
00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:58.485
<i>Yes. that's her real name.</i>

218
00:16:58.618 --> 00:17:00.019
<i>Let's go talk to her.</i>

219
00:17:02.422 --> 00:17:05.024
<i>So. Liberty.
tell people about yourself.</i>

220
00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:08.161
I think she's mute.

221
00:17:09.196 --> 00:17:11.564
-  Like a TV?
<i>No.</i>

222
00:17:11.698 --> 00:17:13.466
<i>She's referring to
the obsolete term of "mute."</i>

223
00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.335
<i>dealing with those
who suffer from a condition</i>

224
00:17:15.468 --> 00:17:17.170
<i>that caused them
to not be able to speak.</i>

225
00:17:17.304 --> 00:17:19.839
<i>You know who that was.</i>

226
00:17:19.972 --> 00:17:21.908
<i>my friends.
"Know-it-all" Haven.</i>

227
00:17:23.276 --> 00:17:26.479
<i>Introducing Liberty.
What's your last name?</i>

228
00:17:28.648 --> 00:17:29.716
<i>Jackson.</i>

229
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:32.419
Not mute. just quiet.

230
00:17:34.821 --> 00:17:36.923
<i>Wow.
you've got so many hearts.</i>

231
00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:38.391
<i>Look. They love you.</i>

232
00:18:12.159 --> 00:18:13.926
Liberty. Liberty!

233
00:18:14.561 --> 00:18:16.062
Do you mind?

234
00:18:16.929 --> 00:18:18.431
Oh! Liberty.

235
00:18:18.565 --> 00:18:20.533
Thank goodness
you're all right.

236
00:18:20.667 --> 00:18:23.069
You!
Take All Right. get out.

237
00:18:23.203 --> 00:18:25.138
I need to utilize
the facilities.

238
00:18:39.586 --> 00:18:41.388
Good morning.
good morning.

239
00:18:43.022 --> 00:18:44.224
Where's Ms. Kay at?

240
00:18:47.694 --> 00:18:49.329
Where's your guys' breakfast?

241
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:52.399
It's all right.
I'll make you guys something.

242
00:18:52.532 --> 00:18:53.766
'Cause you know what they say.

243
00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.603
It's the first day
of summer vacay!

244
00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:00.407
We cannot have another summer
like last year.

245
00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:03.643
- What happened last year?
- Oh. now you wanna talk?

246
00:19:03.776 --> 00:19:06.012
My mama said
if I wanna know something.

247
00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:07.680
I have to ask.

248
00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:09.616
Your mom's not here.

249
00:19:12.719 --> 00:19:14.654
She made me study.
Can you imagine?

250
00:19:14.787 --> 00:19:18.024
All summer. studying.
It was torture.

251
00:19:18.157 --> 00:19:20.627
Listen. before she comes.
we have--

252
00:19:21.894 --> 00:19:23.596
"She" has a name.

253
00:19:26.566 --> 00:19:28.535
What y'all down here
whispering about. anyway?

254
00:19:28.668 --> 00:19:31.438
We don't want a summer
like last year. Last year--

255
00:19:33.906 --> 00:19:35.875
Oh. Down here talking about me

256
00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:37.877
bright and early
on this summer day.

257
00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:39.946
Be a shame
if you couldn't enjoy it.

258
00:19:44.851 --> 00:19:46.653
We do have plans today. though.

259
00:19:47.153 --> 00:19:50.122
- Really? What are they?
- They are most interesting.

260
00:19:51.424 --> 00:19:52.959
- Tell us.
- Chores!

261
00:19:53.092 --> 00:19:55.161
- Ugh!
Fun...

262
00:19:55.295 --> 00:19:56.896
Come on.

263
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:58.798
Yeah.
it's summer cleanup day.

264
00:19:58.931 --> 00:20:00.400
We got somebody
coming to see the house.

265
00:20:00.533 --> 00:20:02.001
Hey!

266
00:20:02.134 --> 00:20:04.504
Breakfast is served.

267
00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.509
What's wrong?
You guys don't like pancakes?

268
00:20:11.844 --> 00:20:13.413
What's wrong?

269
00:20:46.413 --> 00:20:48.180
Hey. Kyle. I'm getting ready
to roll. you wanna go?

270
00:20:48.315 --> 00:20:49.682
- Yes!
Let's go.

271
00:20:49.816 --> 00:20:51.684
How come he gets to go
all the time?

272
00:20:51.818 --> 00:20:53.353
Because he's little.
Are you little?

273
00:20:53.486 --> 00:20:55.021
- Well. no.
- Then clean up.

274
00:20:55.154 --> 00:20:57.924
- Okay.
- I'll get you tomorrow.

275
00:20:58.057 --> 00:21:00.793
No. he won't.
but that was a cute moment.

276
00:21:30.557 --> 00:21:32.925
- Oh. hi. Mrs. Baker.
Hi.

277
00:21:33.059 --> 00:21:35.227
This is Timmy.
my little assistant for today.

278
00:21:35.362 --> 00:21:36.596
Hi. Timmy.
- Hi.

279
00:21:36.729 --> 00:21:37.930
What are you reading?

280
00:21:38.064 --> 00:21:39.566
It's called <i>Weird but True.</i>

281
00:21:39.699 --> 00:21:41.233
Did you know
it's physically impossible

282
00:21:41.368 --> 00:21:43.336
for pigs to
look up into the sky?

283
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:45.304
Because they have no neck.

284
00:21:45.438 --> 00:21:47.840
I did not know that.

285
00:21:47.974 --> 00:21:50.410
Did you get a chance
to look at the Liberty file?

286
00:21:50.543 --> 00:21:53.846
Um.
I thought that file was closed.

287
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.315
- At least on my end.
- It is.

288
00:21:56.449 --> 00:21:58.250
Liberty is now
at the group home.

289
00:21:59.452 --> 00:22:00.753
Okay. so what's the problem?

290
00:22:01.421 --> 00:22:03.923
It's just one of the girls
that I picked up.

291
00:22:04.056 --> 00:22:06.258
Deyja. she didn't have
the best things to say

292
00:22:06.393 --> 00:22:08.194
about the group home
and its conditions.

293
00:22:08.327 --> 00:22:12.131
Okay. Ms. Kay's is rated
number one in Vegas.

294
00:22:12.264 --> 00:22:14.434
So are we really gonna go
off the opinion of one kid?

295
00:22:14.567 --> 00:22:16.469
Well.
if you would have been there.

296
00:22:16.603 --> 00:22:18.004
you would have felt what I felt.

297
00:22:18.137 --> 00:22:19.839
that something
just isn't right.

298
00:22:19.972 --> 00:22:22.509
Okay. I don't know what
you want me to do about it.

299
00:22:22.642 --> 00:22:24.544
I make the recommendations
with the court.

300
00:22:24.677 --> 00:22:27.113
You handle all the in-between
'cause you're the case worker.

301
00:22:27.246 --> 00:22:30.517
I was just hoping for some
support from the state's office

302
00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:34.020
while I look into what's
going on at 423 Crescent Street.

303
00:22:34.153 --> 00:22:35.788
- What did you say?

304
00:22:35.922 --> 00:22:38.190
If I'm to make
some allegation of impropriety.

305
00:22:38.324 --> 00:22:41.060
- it would be nice to have some--
- No. no. no. I heard that.

306
00:22:41.193 --> 00:22:43.830
But the address.
You said Crescent Street?

307
00:22:44.664 --> 00:22:48.000
Did you not read
any of the paperwork?

308
00:22:48.134 --> 00:22:49.669
That's the home!

309
00:22:52.138 --> 00:22:53.973
You know what. forget it.
Let's go.

310
00:23:02.214 --> 00:23:03.315
Oh...

311
00:23:11.323 --> 00:23:12.525
Mrs. Jeffcoat.

312
00:23:14.393 --> 00:23:15.728
Yeah. I'll be there in a second.

313
00:23:16.496 --> 00:23:17.564
Okay.

314
00:23:22.469 --> 00:23:23.870
Ms. Terry.
you wanted to see me?

315
00:23:24.003 --> 00:23:25.738
Oh. yes. Come on in.

316
00:23:27.707 --> 00:23:30.843
So. I heard the private sector
has been calling.

317
00:23:31.478 --> 00:23:34.681
Yeah. but I'm not sure
on what I'm gonna do yet.

318
00:23:34.814 --> 00:23:37.016
But of course.
when I do. I'll let you know.

319
00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:38.918
You know.
this isn't my first rodeo.

320
00:23:39.051 --> 00:23:40.587
It happens every few years.

321
00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.522
We get a bright
shining star like you.

322
00:23:42.655 --> 00:23:44.223
and some private law firm.

323
00:23:44.356 --> 00:23:45.725
with money
that we couldn't even afford.

324
00:23:45.858 --> 00:23:47.193
comes calling.

325
00:23:47.694 --> 00:23:49.762
Yeah. but it's not about
the money for me.

326
00:23:49.896 --> 00:23:53.533
I really did-- I do
care about these kids.

327
00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.267
I know you do. Reena.

328
00:23:55.935 --> 00:23:57.904
This industry.
your connection with your story

329
00:23:58.037 --> 00:23:59.371
is the reason
why I fought so hard

330
00:23:59.506 --> 00:24:00.740
for you to be in this business.

331
00:24:02.374 --> 00:24:04.811
So. what are they offering you?

332
00:24:06.012 --> 00:24:08.648
Excuse me? No.

333
00:24:08.781 --> 00:24:11.383
I think it's a bit inappropriate
to talk about salary.

334
00:24:11.518 --> 00:24:12.585
Oh. 200?

335
00:24:12.719 --> 00:24:14.721
You're worth 225 or 250.

336
00:24:14.854 --> 00:24:17.089
I've been offered
twice as much before.

337
00:24:19.358 --> 00:24:21.093
So why are you still here?

338
00:24:22.228 --> 00:24:25.965
Well. some things
you just can't put a price on.

339
00:24:30.737 --> 00:24:31.838
Mmm.

340
00:24:32.605 --> 00:24:33.840
Thank you for the coffee.

341
00:24:34.807 --> 00:24:37.243
Of course.
You seem stressed lately.

342
00:24:39.378 --> 00:24:40.947
Yeah. I just don't know
why it's so hard

343
00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.281
for me to make my decision.

344
00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:44.851
Honestly.

345
00:24:44.984 --> 00:24:46.786
I'll support
whatever makes you happy.

346
00:24:46.919 --> 00:24:49.288
I mean.
the money would be great.

347
00:24:49.421 --> 00:24:51.524
but we're doing just fine
with what we got. too.

348
00:24:51.658 --> 00:24:54.093
I mean. who wants to vacation
in Paris and Milan?

349
00:24:56.563 --> 00:24:58.798
Yeah. I guess you're right.

350
00:25:05.638 --> 00:25:07.940
Reena.
Just checking in.

351
00:25:08.608 --> 00:25:10.977
We're filing
the paperwork in a few days

352
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:12.945
and I need to know
where you stand.

353
00:25:14.647 --> 00:25:17.116
Uh. yes. I accept.

354
00:25:17.917 --> 00:25:20.820
- I-- I wanna join the team.
- Perfect.

355
00:25:21.353 --> 00:25:23.455
I'll send the messenger
over to collect

356
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:25.291
<i>the contract
by the end of the day.</i>

357
00:25:26.325 --> 00:25:28.561
<i>- Can't wait.</i>
- Me. too.

358
00:25:45.778 --> 00:25:47.213
I don't like
the new girl.

359
00:25:47.346 --> 00:25:48.715
She just got here.

360
00:25:48.848 --> 00:25:50.850
Why is she so quiet?

361
00:25:50.983 --> 00:25:53.886
- Nothing to say?
That's so weird.

362
00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:55.354
So you like
the weird girl now?

363
00:25:55.487 --> 00:25:57.523
I don't have a reason
not to like her.

364
00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:00.593
I cannot live like this!

365
00:26:00.727 --> 00:26:02.361
Can you pick this up before

366
00:26:02.494 --> 00:26:04.530
you-know-who comes in asking
what all that noise was?

367
00:26:04.664 --> 00:26:07.166
- She's not coming here.
- And how do you know that?

368
00:26:07.299 --> 00:26:08.901
Because she's
showing people the house.

369
00:26:09.035 --> 00:26:10.169
What people?

370
00:26:13.472 --> 00:26:16.609
So. this outdoor furniture is
just like the indoor furniture.

371
00:26:16.743 --> 00:26:18.544
If you love it.
you can have it.

372
00:26:18.678 --> 00:26:20.880
Mmm.
How many bedrooms was it again?

373
00:26:21.013 --> 00:26:22.348
- Three.
- Ah.

374
00:26:22.915 --> 00:26:24.884
Okay.
When can it be available?

375
00:26:25.017 --> 00:26:26.452
Um. as soon as you can pay me.

376
00:27:06.793 --> 00:27:08.728
Kids. come down here now.

377
00:27:08.861 --> 00:27:11.430
And if your clothes are dirty.
change them.

378
00:27:35.221 --> 00:27:38.758
I don't know how to say this.
so I might as well just say it.

379
00:27:40.092 --> 00:27:41.961
Um...

380
00:27:43.763 --> 00:27:46.165
I'm closing Crescent House.

381
00:27:50.136 --> 00:27:53.139
- Yes. Haven.
- You're selling it. correct?

382
00:27:53.272 --> 00:27:55.942
- Yes.
- Are you buying a new one?

383
00:27:56.075 --> 00:27:58.711
- Yes. Haven.
- Great. I'll go pack my things.

384
00:27:58.845 --> 00:28:00.880
She's not taking us with her.

385
00:28:02.414 --> 00:28:04.516
- What?
- You get two points.

386
00:28:05.151 --> 00:28:07.820
She's right.
You kids aren't coming with me.

387
00:28:13.359 --> 00:28:14.727
Heard this before.

388
00:28:16.128 --> 00:28:18.030
What happens to us?

389
00:28:18.597 --> 00:28:20.699
They split us up.

390
00:28:20.833 --> 00:28:23.870
Send us to different families
or group homes. and that's that.

391
00:28:25.037 --> 00:28:28.207
Look.
you kids are nice kids.

392
00:28:29.541 --> 00:28:31.744
Might even say
I kind of like you.

393
00:28:32.644 --> 00:28:34.180
But the money
you're bringing in.

394
00:28:34.313 --> 00:28:35.381
it's not cutting it.

395
00:28:36.382 --> 00:28:39.385
I'm gonna sell this house.
I'm going to Mexico.

396
00:28:39.518 --> 00:28:42.388
I'm gonna lay on the beach.
Don't worry about me.

397
00:28:43.489 --> 00:28:44.590
Typical.

398
00:28:44.723 --> 00:28:46.125
Watch your mouth.

399
00:28:47.026 --> 00:28:49.661
Why?
You're splitting us up anyway.

400
00:28:51.197 --> 00:28:52.698
I just got here.

401
00:29:00.406 --> 00:29:04.510
Look. sometimes
they keep us all together. so...

402
00:29:04.643 --> 00:29:06.245
it may not be that bad.

403
00:29:27.333 --> 00:29:29.368
It's going to be okay. Liberty.

404
00:29:29.501 --> 00:29:31.770
You're being really nice to her.

405
00:29:31.904 --> 00:29:33.639
- So?
- Why?

406
00:29:33.772 --> 00:29:35.942
Someone was nice
to you once. too.

407
00:29:37.343 --> 00:29:39.478
You don't have to pretend
to be nice to me.

408
00:29:39.611 --> 00:29:42.281
We're not gonna be here
much longer anyways.

409
00:29:42.414 --> 00:29:44.283
You believed her.
didn't you?

410
00:29:44.884 --> 00:29:47.386
What?
- That you can call her "Mom"?

411
00:29:47.519 --> 00:29:48.787
Yeah.

412
00:29:49.922 --> 00:29:51.723
Where's your mother and father?

413
00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:55.761
Oh. you don't have
a mother or father?

414
00:29:55.895 --> 00:29:57.964
Newsflash.
none of us do.

415
00:30:02.468 --> 00:30:04.170
Why are you here?

416
00:30:05.938 --> 00:30:07.139
They died.

417
00:30:08.207 --> 00:30:10.409
Your mother and father died?

418
00:30:10.977 --> 00:30:13.179
Yeah. My grandparents
couldn't keep me.

419
00:30:13.312 --> 00:30:14.713
So Mrs. Baker brought me here.

420
00:30:15.414 --> 00:30:17.249
Now I have to leave here?

421
00:30:17.884 --> 00:30:19.251
Our parents died too.

422
00:30:20.552 --> 00:30:21.954
It was a long time ago. though.

423
00:30:22.088 --> 00:30:23.755
And we've been
living here ever since.

424
00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:25.992
It's not that bad
once you get used to it.

425
00:30:26.458 --> 00:30:28.260
Guess I'll never find out.

426
00:30:31.097 --> 00:30:34.466
- Michael. can you help me?
- Anything for you. Liberty.

427
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:39.605
<i>It's Daisy. live.</i>

428
00:30:39.738 --> 00:30:41.607
<i>We just got some bad news
here at the Crescent House.</i>

429
00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:43.509
<i>But there's something
much more exciting going on.</i>

430
00:30:43.642 --> 00:30:45.878
<i>As soon as I find out what up.
I'll tell you.</i>

431
00:30:46.012 --> 00:30:47.179
<i>But let's watch this together.</i>

432
00:30:59.591 --> 00:31:01.227
<i>What is it?
- I don't know.</i>

433
00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:03.529
<i>I found it earlier
and I forgot about it.</i>

434
00:31:03.662 --> 00:31:06.198
<i>- What were you doing in here?
- Cleaning.</i>

435
00:31:07.433 --> 00:31:09.401
<i>I think we should
take this into our room.</i>

436
00:31:13.539 --> 00:31:15.741
<i>Haven is right.
This could be top-secret.</i>

437
00:31:15.874 --> 00:31:17.043
<i>I'll be back.</i>

438
00:31:23.983 --> 00:31:25.084
Are you gonna open it?

439
00:31:25.851 --> 00:31:27.920
- What's taking you so long?
- Stop. Carleigh.

440
00:31:46.172 --> 00:31:47.239
What's that?

441
00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:56.949
It was written in 1999.

442
00:31:57.083 --> 00:31:58.350
That was. like...

443
00:31:59.651 --> 00:32:02.254
- 25 years ago.
- Whoa.

444
00:32:02.921 --> 00:32:05.524
That's a lot of years. guys.

445
00:32:05.657 --> 00:32:07.559
- It is.
Are you gonna read it?

446
00:32:07.693 --> 00:32:08.760
Yeah.

447
00:32:10.396 --> 00:32:12.298
"To whoever gets this..."

448
00:32:13.599 --> 00:32:14.933
<i>
...I have to leave this house</i>

449
00:32:15.067 --> 00:32:16.468
<i>because my parents said so.</i>

450
00:32:17.703 --> 00:32:20.372
<i>I love this house
and I'll never forget about it.</i>

451
00:32:21.707 --> 00:32:23.976
<i>In school we learned
about time capsules.</i>

452
00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:25.978
<i>and they said
when you make one.</i>

453
00:32:26.112 --> 00:32:28.114
<i>a piece of you
will always stay there.</i>

454
00:32:30.249 --> 00:32:33.585
<i>I am also leaving a map of
my favorite places in the city.</i>

455
00:32:35.354 --> 00:32:37.656
<i>just in case I never
get to go back to them.</i>

456
00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:39.658
<i>Each place has a piece of me.</i>

457
00:32:44.263 --> 00:32:47.466
<i>And maybe whoever you are
will have a piece of me too.</i>

458
00:32:50.569 --> 00:32:53.105
"Happy birthday to me.
Karina H."

459
00:32:54.406 --> 00:32:55.741
What's that?

460
00:32:58.244 --> 00:33:00.012
I wonder what it means.

461
00:33:00.746 --> 00:33:03.515
- You don't know what a map is?
- That's not what I mean.

462
00:33:05.217 --> 00:33:07.519
What if it is like
a scavenger hunt?

463
00:33:07.653 --> 00:33:09.755
What's a scattenger hunt?

464
00:33:10.656 --> 00:33:12.624
Uh. like an Easter egg hunt
in the backyard.

465
00:33:12.758 --> 00:33:15.361
Oh.
We don't need a map for that.

466
00:33:15.494 --> 00:33:17.696
- You think?
- What if it is?

467
00:33:17.829 --> 00:33:19.665
What if Karina H.
is showing us something.

468
00:33:19.798 --> 00:33:23.169
and at the end. we find. like.
a-- a treasure or something.

469
00:33:23.302 --> 00:33:25.671
That sounds dirty.
No thanks.

470
00:33:26.305 --> 00:33:28.340
This map has
seven places highlighted.

471
00:33:28.474 --> 00:33:30.142
It's not too far off.

472
00:33:30.609 --> 00:33:32.444
The letter says nothing
about a scavenger hunt.

473
00:33:32.578 --> 00:33:34.012
But look at it.

474
00:33:34.146 --> 00:33:36.148
It keeps mentioning
pieces of herself.

475
00:33:36.282 --> 00:33:39.785
- Pieces! Things!
- She has a point.

476
00:33:39.918 --> 00:33:43.322
What if the pieces of her
lead us to her?

477
00:33:43.455 --> 00:33:45.057
And why do we wanna
see some old lady?

478
00:33:45.191 --> 00:33:47.293
She loves this house.
Maybe she'll come back.

479
00:33:47.426 --> 00:33:49.561
And kick us out? We're already
getting kicked out.

480
00:33:49.695 --> 00:33:50.996
This is dumb.

481
00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:52.331
Haven.

482
00:33:53.432 --> 00:33:55.201
I think we should try.

483
00:33:56.335 --> 00:33:58.670
- Try what?
- To follow the signs.

484
00:33:58.804 --> 00:34:00.172
And what if
it leads to nothing?

485
00:34:00.306 --> 00:34:01.540
But what if it does?

486
00:34:01.673 --> 00:34:02.908
I want to try.

487
00:34:04.543 --> 00:34:07.379
I don't care.
but it would be amazing.

488
00:34:07.513 --> 00:34:09.881
I can get another
1.000 followers from this.

489
00:34:11.183 --> 00:34:14.553
Lailah. we've already lost.
What else do we have to lose?

490
00:34:14.686 --> 00:34:15.987
I wanna go!

491
00:34:17.156 --> 00:34:18.224
Lailah?

492
00:34:20.226 --> 00:34:22.428
Sure beats cleaning
for the next 30 days.

493
00:34:23.329 --> 00:34:24.896
I still think this is stupid.

494
00:34:25.697 --> 00:34:27.599
Okay.
so this is the plan...

495
00:34:28.734 --> 00:34:31.337
<i>It's summer. Ms. Kay
isn't waking up before 9:00.</i>

496
00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:33.071
<i>We need to leave before then.</i>

497
00:34:33.205 --> 00:34:35.207
<i>Me and Car
will make the snacks.</i>

498
00:34:35.341 --> 00:34:37.576
<i>Haven. Liberty. and Daisy pack
the essentials in the backpack.</i>

499
00:34:45.551 --> 00:34:47.886
<i>Once all that is done.
we need to leave quietly.</i>

500
00:34:55.727 --> 00:34:56.795
- Ahh!

501
00:34:56.928 --> 00:34:58.464
Up early. I see.

502
00:34:59.731 --> 00:35:01.767
We're going on
a scattenger hunt.

503
00:35:02.434 --> 00:35:04.069
- Scattenger?
- Scavenger.

504
00:35:04.203 --> 00:35:06.772
Ah. that makes more sense.
Where's Ms. Kay at?

505
00:35:06.905 --> 00:35:09.208
Asleep.
- I figured.

506
00:35:09.341 --> 00:35:10.809
Have you guys
eaten breakfast already?

507
00:35:10.942 --> 00:35:13.111
Yeah.
- Yeah. we made it delicious.

508
00:35:13.245 --> 00:35:15.013
- No. we didn't.
Bro.

509
00:35:15.714 --> 00:35:17.549
Well. okay. so since
you guys already ate breakfast

510
00:35:17.683 --> 00:35:19.551
and you haven't. Kyle.
how about me and you go to.

511
00:35:19.685 --> 00:35:21.253
let's say... IHOP?

512
00:35:21.387 --> 00:35:22.721
We'll let the big kids
handle the adventure.

513
00:35:22.854 --> 00:35:24.390
That sounds like a great idea.

514
00:35:24.523 --> 00:35:27.759
Aw. man. I wanted to
go find the gold. too.

515
00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:30.229
It's all right. We'll find
our own gold. how about that?

516
00:35:30.362 --> 00:35:31.930
All right.
you guys be safe.

517
00:35:32.063 --> 00:35:33.765
Make sure you take care
of each other. all right?

518
00:35:33.899 --> 00:35:35.301
Okay.
- All right. See you guys.

519
00:35:35.434 --> 00:35:37.068
- Bye. Kyle.
All right.

520
00:35:40.772 --> 00:35:42.107
This is Reena Jeffcoat.

521
00:35:42.241 --> 00:35:44.843
an expert with
Nevada family law.

522
00:35:44.976 --> 00:35:47.313
She will be handling
all of the custody aspects

523
00:35:47.446 --> 00:35:48.747
of the divorce.

524
00:35:49.781 --> 00:35:51.650
Tell me about yourself. Reena.

525
00:35:52.618 --> 00:35:54.653
Uh. well.
I grew up in Vegas.

526
00:35:54.786 --> 00:35:57.789
Uh. my family home is actually
not too far from here.

527
00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:00.526
When I was ten.
my dad got really sick.

528
00:36:00.659 --> 00:36:02.828
My mom died shortly after that.

529
00:36:03.329 --> 00:36:04.930
I ended up
going to a group home.

530
00:36:05.063 --> 00:36:07.766
But fast forward.
and now I'm in family law.

531
00:36:07.899 --> 00:36:09.268
I love that.

532
00:36:09.401 --> 00:36:10.436
Not the stuff
about your parents.

533
00:36:10.569 --> 00:36:12.137
but that you're from Vegas.

534
00:36:12.271 --> 00:36:14.440
You don't meet too many
of us natives anymore.

535
00:36:14.573 --> 00:36:17.309
Tell me about your favorite
memory growing up here.

536
00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:21.146
Uh. there's so many. Um...

537
00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:23.382
I'd have to say the Vegas sign

538
00:36:23.515 --> 00:36:25.784
was probably one of
my favorite things as a kid.

539
00:36:26.818 --> 00:36:27.986
Me and my dad would...

540
00:36:28.954 --> 00:36:30.456
That part--
that part doesn't matter.

541
00:36:30.589 --> 00:36:32.624
But I am very excited
to join the case.

542
00:36:34.092 --> 00:36:36.061
I like her.
I like her a lot.

543
00:36:36.194 --> 00:36:37.796
Dr. Evans. you sure have added

544
00:36:37.929 --> 00:36:39.465
a wonderful new person
to the team.

545
00:36:39.598 --> 00:36:41.367
Now. Reena. in a few days.

546
00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:42.834
a lot of eyes will be on you.

547
00:36:42.968 --> 00:36:44.470
Is that something
you're comfortable with?

548
00:36:44.603 --> 00:36:46.171
Once the press gets
a hold of the divorce

549
00:36:46.305 --> 00:36:48.073
of one of Vegas's power couples.

550
00:36:48.206 --> 00:36:51.209
everyone is going to want to
know who is representing me.

551
00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:54.413
Uh. yes.
they have made me aware

552
00:36:54.546 --> 00:36:56.348
of the eyes that
are gonna be on the case.

553
00:36:56.482 --> 00:36:59.718
but I'm ready for this new phase
and this beginning.

554
00:37:09.628 --> 00:37:11.263
It has to be here somewhere.

555
00:37:11.397 --> 00:37:13.064
This is where
it told us to come.

556
00:37:13.198 --> 00:37:15.567
We need to find
a piece of Karina H.

557
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:19.538
Yeah...

558
00:37:20.038 --> 00:37:22.774
- Well. I'm gonna go look.
- Yeah! Let's.

559
00:37:27.879 --> 00:37:29.047
Ew.

560
00:37:39.157 --> 00:37:40.892
- What are you doing?
- Looking.

561
00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:42.628
Whatever.

562
00:37:57.208 --> 00:37:58.910
<i>It's your girl Daisy.</i>

563
00:37:59.044 --> 00:38:00.779
<i>We're out here. y'all.
with a scavenger hunt.</i>

564
00:38:00.912 --> 00:38:02.814
<i>We're trying to find
the mysterious Karina H.</i>

565
00:38:02.948 --> 00:38:04.616
<i>Oh. Haven thinks
she found something.</i>

566
00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:06.284
<i>Let's go see
what she has to say.</i>

567
00:38:06.785 --> 00:38:08.387
<i>Where did she find this?</i>

568
00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:09.821
<i>Well. where would kids be?</i>

569
00:38:10.422 --> 00:38:12.958
<i>- The playground?
- Exactly.</i>

570
00:38:15.961 --> 00:38:17.329
<i>There's no way.</i>

571
00:38:17.963 --> 00:38:20.231
<i>If this sign is circled
on the map...</i>

572
00:38:22.968 --> 00:38:24.803
<i>then this is a clue from Karina.</i>

573
00:38:25.437 --> 00:38:28.340
<i>So you want me to believe
that that paper</i>

574
00:38:28.474 --> 00:38:32.444
<i>has been in the same spot
for. like. 25-- 25 years?</i>

575
00:38:33.979 --> 00:38:35.080
<i>It is.</i>

576
00:38:35.647 --> 00:38:36.948
<i>The sign's on the map?</i>

577
00:38:40.051 --> 00:38:41.119
<i>Wow.</i>

578
00:38:41.887 --> 00:38:45.657
<i>Wow! That--
that could be anything.</i>

579
00:38:46.592 --> 00:38:47.926
<i>Great work. team.</i>

580
00:38:49.395 --> 00:38:51.196
<i>We found our first clue.</i>

581
00:38:52.631 --> 00:38:54.265
<i>Wow. This is crazy.</i>

582
00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.468
<i>I'll be back.
Crescent Gang out.</i>

583
00:38:58.837 --> 00:39:00.639
This could just be
a coincidence.

584
00:39:00.772 --> 00:39:02.541
but I think we should
go to the sign first.

585
00:39:03.509 --> 00:39:04.610
I agree.

586
00:39:05.444 --> 00:39:06.812
Daisy. I like that.

587
00:39:06.945 --> 00:39:09.681
- What?
-"The Crescent Gang."

588
00:39:09.815 --> 00:39:12.984
Oh. I made it up on the fly.
That's our adventure name.

589
00:39:15.821 --> 00:39:17.122
The Crescent Gang.

590
00:39:17.789 --> 00:39:19.725
- The Crescent Gang.
- The Crescent Gang.

591
00:39:19.858 --> 00:39:20.892
The Crescent Gang.

592
00:39:21.026 --> 00:39:22.694
I made it up. by the way.

593
00:39:23.395 --> 00:39:24.463
The Crescent Gang.

594
00:39:26.665 --> 00:39:28.534
The Crescent Gang.

595
00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:32.203
- Two. three. Crescent Gang!
Crescent Gang!

596
00:39:33.972 --> 00:39:35.674
Surprise!
What?

597
00:39:35.807 --> 00:39:38.176
- What? You guys!
Congratulations.

598
00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:40.579
Ah. thank you.
Here you go.

599
00:39:40.712 --> 00:39:42.180
Cheers!

600
00:39:46.518 --> 00:39:49.588
- There you go.
- We're gonna miss you so much.

601
00:39:49.721 --> 00:39:51.222
Thank you. thank you.

602
00:39:51.356 --> 00:39:52.891
Okay. speech.
Give us a speech.

603
00:39:53.024 --> 00:39:54.860
-  Speech. speech!
- Come on.

604
00:39:54.993 --> 00:39:56.361
We're not gonna see you
for a while.

605
00:39:56.495 --> 00:39:58.530
- I hate speeches.
- Oh. come on.

606
00:39:58.664 --> 00:40:01.032
You got this.

607
00:40:01.166 --> 00:40:04.169
I just wanna say thank you to
all of you for coming to work

608
00:40:04.302 --> 00:40:06.004
and all of your hard work

609
00:40:06.137 --> 00:40:08.907
and your friendships
over the last four years.

610
00:40:09.407 --> 00:40:12.878
And family court
is not the easiest

611
00:40:13.011 --> 00:40:15.280
or a particularly joyous field.

612
00:40:15.413 --> 00:40:17.716
but coming to work
with all of you

613
00:40:17.849 --> 00:40:19.685
has definitely made it
a whole lot easier.

614
00:40:20.652 --> 00:40:22.454
Aww.

615
00:40:22.588 --> 00:40:24.856
I'm definitely gonna
carry all of you in my heart.

616
00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:26.558
and I really am sad
that I'm leaving.

617
00:40:27.225 --> 00:40:28.894
Until we meet again.

618
00:40:29.027 --> 00:40:31.029
Until we meet again.

619
00:40:31.162 --> 00:40:33.198
All right. everyone.
Please. let's go.

620
00:40:33.331 --> 00:40:37.736
Oh. gosh.
Come on. Mrs. Terry! Stop.

621
00:40:43.341 --> 00:40:45.410
Well. this is supposed
to be a happy occasion.

622
00:40:45.544 --> 00:40:47.378
Can I at least
get a "congratulations"?

623
00:40:48.847 --> 00:40:50.081
Congratulations.

624
00:40:51.082 --> 00:40:52.784
Look. I'm gonna pass down

625
00:40:52.918 --> 00:40:55.053
all the information
about the group home

626
00:40:55.186 --> 00:40:57.789
and have my replacement
handle it. okay?

627
00:40:58.256 --> 00:40:59.758
Whatever helps you
sleep at night.

628
00:41:01.059 --> 00:41:02.160
What's your problem?

629
00:41:03.094 --> 00:41:05.330
What is so bad about me
trying to live my life?

630
00:41:05.463 --> 00:41:08.166
I'm sorry I don't wanna be stuck
here for 40 years like you.

631
00:41:10.401 --> 00:41:12.403
That's where
our perspectives differ.

632
00:41:13.071 --> 00:41:14.806
I'm not stuck here
by any means.

633
00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:17.909
I-- I choose
to be here every day.

634
00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:20.579
And that's something
I can be proud of.

635
00:41:20.712 --> 00:41:22.013
Compared to someone like you.

636
00:41:22.147 --> 00:41:25.083
who goes wherever
the wind blows.

637
00:41:25.216 --> 00:41:28.353
who has no loyalty
or commitment to a city

638
00:41:28.486 --> 00:41:30.756
you claim to love so much.

639
00:41:30.889 --> 00:41:33.692
Okay. Well. you don't know
anything about me.

640
00:41:33.825 --> 00:41:36.828
Or my story. because I was
just like Liberty. okay?

641
00:41:36.962 --> 00:41:38.429
- Parents gone.

642
00:41:38.564 --> 00:41:40.265
grandparents unable
to take care of me.

643
00:41:40.398 --> 00:41:42.167
Ended up in a group home.
And look at me.

644
00:41:42.801 --> 00:41:43.869
I turned out fine.

645
00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:46.638
- Did you?
- Did I what?

646
00:41:47.105 --> 00:41:48.940
Did you turn out fine?

647
00:41:51.142 --> 00:41:54.613
Sure. you have a nice family.
a nice job.

648
00:41:54.746 --> 00:41:58.316
But what does that matter
if this isn't working?

649
00:41:59.918 --> 00:42:02.053
Congratulations
on your success.

650
00:42:02.187 --> 00:42:03.521
I wish you the best.

651
00:42:36.688 --> 00:42:39.991
This is not real grass. y'all.

652
00:42:40.659 --> 00:42:43.595
Ain't no way these place has
look this good for 25 years.

653
00:42:43.729 --> 00:42:46.164
You never know. We can't just
give up when we found a clue.

654
00:42:46.297 --> 00:42:48.734
- We didn't find a clue.
Come on. guys.

655
00:42:48.867 --> 00:42:50.568
There isn't anything
for us to find here.

656
00:42:57.876 --> 00:43:00.411
- Guys!
Come on. Michael.

657
00:43:00.545 --> 00:43:01.913
How do you spell "Karina"?

658
00:43:02.047 --> 00:43:04.582
K-A-R-I-N-A.

659
00:43:04.716 --> 00:43:05.784
H?

660
00:43:07.218 --> 00:43:09.621
Guys. I think you wanna
come and take a look at this.

661
00:43:14.926 --> 00:43:17.095
Gosh. gosh. gosh.

662
00:43:17.228 --> 00:43:20.231
What?
- Bonanza General Store?

663
00:43:20.365 --> 00:43:22.868
Seriously?
This is really happening.

664
00:43:23.001 --> 00:43:25.236
You found our next clue!

665
00:43:31.877 --> 00:43:32.978
It's circled.

666
00:43:33.679 --> 00:43:36.214
It's here.
We're going to find her!

667
00:43:37.015 --> 00:43:38.984
<i>We need to search
every inch of this place.</i>

668
00:43:40.251 --> 00:43:41.953
<i>Check every door
and every window.</i>

669
00:43:42.453 --> 00:43:44.823
<i>We can't afford
to overlook any area.</i>

670
00:43:48.126 --> 00:43:49.728
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

671
00:43:49.861 --> 00:43:51.730
There has to be
something. right?

672
00:43:51.863 --> 00:43:54.065
We had to believe at
a certain point. this would end.

673
00:43:54.199 --> 00:43:55.801
We lied to ourselves.

674
00:43:55.934 --> 00:43:57.669
Why would this lady
even wanna help us. anyways?

675
00:43:57.803 --> 00:43:59.671
It was worth a try
to stay together.

676
00:43:59.805 --> 00:44:01.106
We don't even know you.

677
00:44:04.142 --> 00:44:06.778
Where would we go to see
the top of this building?

678
00:44:06.912 --> 00:44:08.413
Why?

679
00:44:09.114 --> 00:44:10.181
Well...

680
00:44:11.883 --> 00:44:12.951
look at the circle.

681
00:44:13.785 --> 00:44:16.254
It's close. but something's
telling me that it's higher.

682
00:44:16.387 --> 00:44:18.456
so we'll be able to
see what we need to see.

683
00:44:20.658 --> 00:44:23.428
<i>We need your help!
We're downtown Las Vegas.</i>

684
00:44:23.561 --> 00:44:24.863
<i>We need to find something
that's high enough</i>

685
00:44:24.996 --> 00:44:26.364
<i>to see the top of the building.</i>

686
00:44:27.165 --> 00:44:28.433
<i>Escalators?</i>

687
00:44:30.601 --> 00:44:31.937
<i>Genius.</i>

688
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:33.538
<i>You heard her.
You're a genius.</i>

689
00:44:33.671 --> 00:44:35.106
<i>Thank you for your help.
I'll be back.</i>

690
00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:37.943
<i>Crescent Gang out!</i>

691
00:44:57.929 --> 00:44:59.464
This is too far.

692
00:44:59.597 --> 00:45:01.166
We can't see
the top of the building.

693
00:45:02.167 --> 00:45:03.534
But it was circled.

694
00:45:04.135 --> 00:45:06.404
We are looking
dumber and dumber.

695
00:45:07.638 --> 00:45:09.875
Where's your imagination?

696
00:45:10.008 --> 00:45:12.377
- I lost it.
- Do you need help finding it?

697
00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:17.749
- This place is really beautiful.
Yeah.

698
00:45:17.883 --> 00:45:19.985
I mean. part of the beauty
of being up here

699
00:45:20.118 --> 00:45:22.253
is we can see all the...
mountains!

700
00:45:22.387 --> 00:45:24.022
We can see all the mountains!

701
00:45:24.555 --> 00:45:26.724
We didn't need to see
the top of the building.

702
00:45:26.858 --> 00:45:28.860
We needed to see
the top of the mountains.

703
00:45:28.994 --> 00:45:30.528
Do you understand
what she's saying?

704
00:45:30.661 --> 00:45:32.230
Because I don't understand
what she's saying.

705
00:45:33.064 --> 00:45:35.566
Yeah. we can see
the mountains from anywhere.

706
00:45:36.334 --> 00:45:38.069
No. not like this.

707
00:45:38.203 --> 00:45:40.571
We're higher.
so we can see all around.

708
00:45:41.739 --> 00:45:42.874
I think we broke her.

709
00:45:45.911 --> 00:45:47.212
Red Rock.

710
00:45:48.079 --> 00:45:49.180
Red Rock?

711
00:45:51.182 --> 00:45:52.483
That's what this is.

712
00:45:53.184 --> 00:45:56.855
We're figuring it out. y'all.
We are really figuring it out.

713
00:45:56.988 --> 00:45:58.623
We can't get to Red Rock alone.

714
00:45:58.756 --> 00:46:02.060
- Sure can't.
- I have an idea.

715
00:46:04.062 --> 00:46:06.531
Carleigh. go find your brother
and keep him quiet.

716
00:46:06.664 --> 00:46:08.633
Hey!
Been out on the town. I see.

717
00:46:08.766 --> 00:46:10.735
And we have chores here.

718
00:46:10.869 --> 00:46:13.071
Did you find the gold--

719
00:46:13.204 --> 00:46:14.940
- Gold? Gold?
- Yeah.

720
00:46:15.073 --> 00:46:17.475
Kids were out looking for gold
on a scavenger hunt.

721
00:46:17.608 --> 00:46:18.877
Oh. so you knew this?

722
00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:20.879
- Yeah.
- And you didn't tell me?

723
00:46:21.012 --> 00:46:23.314
- I mean. I must've forgot.
- Okay.

724
00:46:23.448 --> 00:46:25.917
- Chores and all.
- Ah. there's still chores to do.

725
00:46:27.085 --> 00:46:28.553
and I expect them to be done.

726
00:46:30.621 --> 00:46:32.623
Cute little smile.
Smile on upstairs.

727
00:46:46.972 --> 00:46:49.340
Now. what is it
y'all want me to do?

728
00:46:49.474 --> 00:46:50.641
Take us to Red Rock.

729
00:46:50.775 --> 00:46:52.143
- In what?
Your car.

730
00:46:52.277 --> 00:46:54.479
Y'all are not
gonna fit in my car.

731
00:46:54.612 --> 00:46:58.249
We actually can if
we leave Daisy and Kyle here.

732
00:46:58.383 --> 00:47:01.686
Daisy and Kyle? When did I
become one of the little kids?

733
00:47:01.819 --> 00:47:03.922
I'm not little. I'm six.

734
00:47:04.055 --> 00:47:06.257
Mr. Pierce. we really think
we're onto something.

735
00:47:06.391 --> 00:47:09.260
And if we find Karina H..
maybe she can help us.

736
00:47:09.394 --> 00:47:10.761
Does it really mean
that much to y'all?

737
00:47:10.896 --> 00:47:12.130
Yes.

738
00:47:12.263 --> 00:47:13.298
All right.

739
00:47:13.965 --> 00:47:15.133
Let me get my keys.

740
00:48:24.735 --> 00:48:26.537
Hey. easy on the car!

741
00:48:26.671 --> 00:48:28.439
Do you mind?

742
00:48:30.641 --> 00:48:32.243
Look for something
pointing us at something

743
00:48:32.377 --> 00:48:34.112
- out here in the desert.
What did you say?

744
00:48:34.245 --> 00:48:35.780
I said.
look for something

745
00:48:35.913 --> 00:48:37.949
pointing us at something
out here in the desert.

746
00:48:38.083 --> 00:48:39.350
What you say?

747
00:48:41.919 --> 00:48:43.254
I found it!

748
00:48:47.258 --> 00:48:49.427
Without my carbon dating kit.
I can only assume.

749
00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:51.396
but these papers
both seem to be showing

750
00:48:51.529 --> 00:48:54.132
an aging of 20-plus years.

751
00:48:55.266 --> 00:48:57.735
- How old are you again?
- Nine.

752
00:48:58.569 --> 00:49:00.405
- That's it?
- Yes.

753
00:49:00.538 --> 00:49:02.273
And how do you know
about this carbon dating

754
00:49:02.407 --> 00:49:03.708
and how old they are?

755
00:49:03.841 --> 00:49:06.211
Doesn't everybody know?

756
00:49:06.344 --> 00:49:07.645
I don't.

757
00:49:07.778 --> 00:49:09.380
You're not the wiz kid. either.

758
00:49:09.514 --> 00:49:10.781
Clearly.

759
00:49:13.418 --> 00:49:17.288
Let's go. Bonnie Springs
is only nine miles away.

760
00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:34.172
Wait.
this looks closed.

761
00:49:57.562 --> 00:49:59.630
25 years is a long time. guys.

762
00:50:00.098 --> 00:50:02.133
I mean. things change.

763
00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:04.602
And you guys know more about it
than you did before.

764
00:50:04.735 --> 00:50:07.272
so don't be
so hard on yourselves.

765
00:50:07.772 --> 00:50:09.340
But we're so close!

766
00:50:09.474 --> 00:50:10.841
I told y'all!

767
00:50:10.975 --> 00:50:12.610
Shut up. Carleigh.
We were close.

768
00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:27.058
But we were so close.

769
00:50:27.658 --> 00:50:29.194
We found all the pieces of her.

770
00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:39.237
- There's one more circle.
- That's the house. Michael.

771
00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:41.739
We already found
all the stuff there.

772
00:50:51.782 --> 00:50:53.718
- What?

773
00:50:53.851 --> 00:50:55.886
- What happened?
- What do you think?

774
00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:58.055
- No gold?
- No gold. buddy.

775
00:50:58.889 --> 00:51:00.258
We will never know.

776
00:51:04.229 --> 00:51:06.597
<i>It's Daisy.
live. with an update.</i>

777
00:51:06.731 --> 00:51:08.433
<i>We didn't complete
the scavenger hunt.</i>

778
00:51:08.566 --> 00:51:10.568
<i>We don't even know
who Karina H. is.</i>

779
00:51:10.701 --> 00:51:13.238
<i>This is the one time
I don't have anything to say.</i>

780
00:51:14.872 --> 00:51:16.907
<i>Crescent Gang out.</i>

781
00:51:19.410 --> 00:51:20.545
- Six.
- Ooh!

782
00:51:20.678 --> 00:51:22.313
No-- Okay.

783
00:51:23.148 --> 00:51:24.715
- Why do you do that?
- Yeah.

784
00:51:25.583 --> 00:51:27.352
Had y'all been home all day.

785
00:51:27.485 --> 00:51:28.853
these chores would be done!

786
00:51:28.986 --> 00:51:30.621
Where are the other ones?

787
00:51:30.755 --> 00:51:31.922
That's my cue.

788
00:51:43.201 --> 00:51:44.569
Liberty. are you okay?

789
00:51:59.617 --> 00:52:01.118
The last circle.

790
00:52:29.747 --> 00:52:30.815
Ugh!

791
00:53:01.846 --> 00:53:04.215
- Is the coast clear?
- For what?

792
00:53:11.922 --> 00:53:13.157
We found something.

793
00:53:18.663 --> 00:53:20.164
What are you waiting for?

794
00:53:20.298 --> 00:53:21.866
What if it
isn't from Karina H.?

795
00:53:21.999 --> 00:53:23.468
And what if it is?

796
00:53:24.335 --> 00:53:25.736
Where's your imagination?

797
00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:26.971
Wait!

798
00:53:27.472 --> 00:53:28.739
What?

799
00:53:47.458 --> 00:53:49.494
<i>"You found me.
You found my map.</i>

800
00:53:49.627 --> 00:53:51.329
<i>"And I led you to my--</i>

801
00:53:52.196 --> 00:53:54.432
<i>"to my favorite place. my house.</i>

802
00:53:54.565 --> 00:53:57.535
<i>"I told you before. I am really
going to miss this place.</i>

803
00:53:58.235 --> 00:54:00.271
<i>"And since you found this.</i>

804
00:54:00.405 --> 00:54:03.274
<i>"nothing will make me happier
than to meet a person</i>

805
00:54:03.408 --> 00:54:05.576
<i>"who loves this house
just as much as I do.</i>

806
00:54:20.525 --> 00:54:23.060
<i>"I would love to see it again.</i>

807
00:54:23.193 --> 00:54:25.730
<i>"Please let me know
if it's okay to come visit.</i>

808
00:54:25.863 --> 00:54:29.233
<i>"Karina Holloway. 555-8536."</i>

809
00:54:37.007 --> 00:54:38.409
<i>We did it.! We did it!</i>

810
00:54:38.543 --> 00:54:40.811
<i>We found Karina H.
Come on. girls.</i>

811
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:47.818
<i>One. two. three.</i>

812
00:54:47.952 --> 00:54:49.587
<i>
Crescent Gang out.</i>

813
00:54:57.127 --> 00:54:58.429
Daisy. you asleep?

814
00:54:58.563 --> 00:55:00.765
No. Haven. you asleep?

815
00:55:00.898 --> 00:55:03.267
No. Liberty. you asleep?

816
00:55:03.801 --> 00:55:06.904
- No. how could I sleep?
I know.

817
00:55:09.607 --> 00:55:11.308
Nobody gonna ask if I'm asleep?

818
00:55:12.743 --> 00:55:14.812
Why?
You didn't believe in Karina H..

819
00:55:14.945 --> 00:55:16.681
so why would you be excited
that we found her?

820
00:55:19.316 --> 00:55:20.918
Carleigh. you asleep?

821
00:55:21.619 --> 00:55:24.088
- Yes.

822
00:55:25.322 --> 00:55:27.091
What is all that noise in there?

823
00:55:27.224 --> 00:55:28.359
Nothing.

824
00:55:28.493 --> 00:55:29.827
All right. now!

825
00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:31.429
You had your fun for the day.

826
00:55:31.562 --> 00:55:33.464
Now.
take y'all hind parts to bed!

827
00:55:34.164 --> 00:55:35.466
Yes.

828
00:55:40.771 --> 00:55:44.208
Tomorrow we're going to
find her. I promise.

829
00:56:01.592 --> 00:56:03.861
Hi. Mrs. Jeffcoat.
Um. I'm here to drop off

830
00:56:03.994 --> 00:56:05.129
a gift from the partners.

831
00:56:05.262 --> 00:56:06.531
- Oh.
- One sec.

832
00:56:19.677 --> 00:56:21.245
- Here you go.
Thank you.

833
00:56:21.378 --> 00:56:23.380
Enjoy. and congratulations.

834
00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:31.556
So you're in
the big leagues now. huh?

835
00:56:32.222 --> 00:56:33.257
I-- I guess so.

836
00:56:38.228 --> 00:56:39.664
Good afternoon. everyone.

837
00:56:39.797 --> 00:56:41.331
In today's mediation.
we will attempt

838
00:56:41.466 --> 00:56:43.434
to settle matters of
the divorce proceeding

839
00:56:43.568 --> 00:56:45.269
in private mediation

840
00:56:45.402 --> 00:56:48.005
with hopes that we can
settle this divorce private--

841
00:56:48.138 --> 00:56:49.440
Give her everything.

842
00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:51.375
Excuse me?

843
00:56:51.976 --> 00:56:54.344
Diane. you can have it all.

844
00:56:54.479 --> 00:56:57.948
The money. the houses.
the cars. the businesses.

845
00:56:58.549 --> 00:57:00.885
Just don't take away Hillary.
Please!

846
00:57:01.018 --> 00:57:03.721
Mr. Hyatt.
this is wildly inappropriate.

847
00:57:03.854 --> 00:57:05.122
Don't say anything.

848
00:57:05.255 --> 00:57:07.057
I'm a good dad
and you know it.

849
00:57:07.191 --> 00:57:09.527
I'm not taking
your daughter away.

850
00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:12.096
Los Angeles is
less than an hour away.

851
00:57:12.229 --> 00:57:14.198
You know as well as I do
that her primary home

852
00:57:14.331 --> 00:57:15.800
and caregiver should be me.

853
00:57:18.335 --> 00:57:20.505
Mr. Hyatt...

854
00:57:21.405 --> 00:57:23.073
due to the nature
of your job

855
00:57:23.207 --> 00:57:24.975
and how much
you travel for work.

856
00:57:25.109 --> 00:57:26.711
as well as your long hours.

857
00:57:26.844 --> 00:57:29.146
it just doesn't
make sense for you to be

858
00:57:29.279 --> 00:57:31.616
the stable primary caregiver
of your daughter.

859
00:57:31.749 --> 00:57:35.219
Exactly. Should she be
raised by your assistant?

860
00:57:36.787 --> 00:57:38.756
I've never missed
a single soccer game.

861
00:57:39.557 --> 00:57:41.592
I've been to every PTO meeting.

862
00:57:41.726 --> 00:57:43.661
But it would require

863
00:57:43.794 --> 00:57:46.764
a significant amount
of restructuring

864
00:57:46.897 --> 00:57:48.633
in your day-to-day life

865
00:57:48.766 --> 00:57:53.470
for any court to grant you
full or even 50-50 custody.

866
00:57:54.872 --> 00:57:57.474
I've had enough of this.
See you in court. Diane.

867
00:58:01.746 --> 00:58:03.480
Well. that went well.

868
00:58:07.718 --> 00:58:09.353
Great job today. Reena.

869
00:58:09.486 --> 00:58:10.821
You really brought it home.

870
00:58:11.556 --> 00:58:12.790
Put the pressure on 'em.

871
00:58:13.824 --> 00:58:15.092
Right. Uh...

872
00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:17.494
I mean.
it kind of sounds like

873
00:58:17.628 --> 00:58:19.329
he'd be willing to do
what needed to be done

874
00:58:19.463 --> 00:58:22.432
where joint custody
would be fair

875
00:58:22.567 --> 00:58:25.335
and also kind of
makes sense. right?

876
00:58:25.469 --> 00:58:29.206
Well. should we be advising
Mrs. Hyatt of that?

877
00:58:31.408 --> 00:58:33.477
Girl.

878
00:58:33.611 --> 00:58:35.613
divorce is not
about being fair.

879
00:58:35.746 --> 00:58:38.282
You should get that
out of your head right now.

880
00:58:38.849 --> 00:58:40.317
This is about winning

881
00:58:41.085 --> 00:58:43.888
and taking as much
from your opponent as you can.

882
00:58:45.856 --> 00:58:48.158
- Great job today.
- Thanks.

883
00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:08.512
Read the phone number
to me again.

884
00:59:08.646 --> 00:59:11.816
- 555-8536.
- Thank you.

885
00:59:11.949 --> 00:59:13.550
How old do you think she is now?

886
00:59:13.684 --> 00:59:16.086
- Old.
Yeah. like 30.

887
00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:17.321
Really old.

888
00:59:18.055 --> 00:59:20.658
She is actually
probably closer to 35.

889
00:59:20.791 --> 00:59:22.893
I'm gathering that she was
about nine or ten

890
00:59:23.027 --> 00:59:24.328
when she moved away
from here.

891
00:59:24.461 --> 00:59:26.263
25 years makes her 35.

892
00:59:27.531 --> 00:59:29.233
- Old.
- Old.

893
00:59:29.366 --> 00:59:31.068
Is that her address right now?

894
00:59:31.201 --> 00:59:33.503
- Yes.
- And how do you know that's her?

895
00:59:34.872 --> 00:59:36.774
I know it's her
because the probability of

896
00:59:36.907 --> 00:59:40.044
more than one Karina Holloway
living at the same address.

897
00:59:40.177 --> 00:59:42.046
moving more than five times
to the same area.

898
00:59:42.179 --> 00:59:45.049
and then returning to
the same area is less than 1%.

899
00:59:45.816 --> 00:59:46.884
What?

900
00:59:47.885 --> 00:59:49.586
Don't worry about it.
It's her.

901
00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:52.723
Like. we can go
to this address right now.

902
00:59:52.857 --> 00:59:54.224
and she'll be there?

903
00:59:54.358 --> 00:59:55.425
Yes.

904
00:59:56.861 --> 00:59:59.129
Maybe we shouldn't do that.
Not without calling first.

905
01:00:00.064 --> 01:00:03.233
- Her phone number.
- You really are a genius.

906
01:00:03.834 --> 01:00:04.902
I know.

907
01:00:09.874 --> 01:00:10.941
<i>Hello?</i>

908
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:16.413
- Uh. is this Karina H.?
<i>- Uh. yes.</i>

909
01:00:20.517 --> 01:00:22.586
- What?
- Yeah.

910
01:00:23.087 --> 01:00:24.922
You just had her
on the phone.

911
01:00:25.055 --> 01:00:26.924
We just wanted to make sure
it was her. right?

912
01:00:27.057 --> 01:00:28.625
And y'all call me dumb.

913
01:00:29.259 --> 01:00:31.128
So. what do we do now?

914
01:00:31.261 --> 01:00:34.098
Well. we have an address
and we have a phone number.

915
01:00:35.099 --> 01:00:37.334
- We go meet Karina H.
- Exactly.

916
01:00:47.611 --> 01:00:49.146
It's going to be
across the street.

917
01:00:52.316 --> 01:00:53.851
This is it.

918
01:00:53.984 --> 01:00:55.085
Whoa.

919
01:00:55.219 --> 01:00:56.787
This is really nice.

920
01:00:56.921 --> 01:00:58.622
She definitely
isn't one of us.

921
01:00:58.756 --> 01:01:00.858
- Maybe she's a doctor.
- Or an actress.

922
01:01:00.991 --> 01:01:02.492
I wonder if she got a daughter.

923
01:01:06.063 --> 01:01:08.365
- What are you doing?
- No point in wasting time.

924
01:01:19.643 --> 01:01:21.678
No more clothes
or outfits. but--

925
01:01:21.812 --> 01:01:24.514
Mr. Hyatt.
you cannot be here.

926
01:01:24.648 --> 01:01:25.950
I did some research on you.

927
01:01:27.651 --> 01:01:30.020
You're from Vegas.
just like me.

928
01:01:31.188 --> 01:01:32.689
I'm a busy man.

929
01:01:32.823 --> 01:01:35.492
but I make time
for my daughter always.

930
01:01:36.326 --> 01:01:38.662
I took her to
my favorite places as a child.

931
01:01:39.429 --> 01:01:42.800
Sunset Park.
old convenience stores.

932
01:01:42.933 --> 01:01:44.368
Honey Buns and pop.

933
01:01:45.435 --> 01:01:46.636
Please.

934
01:01:47.604 --> 01:01:49.406
Don't take her away from me.

935
01:01:49.539 --> 01:01:51.041
the only home
she's ever known.

936
01:01:53.844 --> 01:01:56.747
Mr. Hyatt.
you're not supposed to be here.

937
01:01:58.182 --> 01:01:59.249
I'm sorry.

938
01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.230
Hello. Can I help you?

939
01:02:18.735 --> 01:02:20.437
Are you selling something?

940
01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:22.873
Marry me.

941
01:02:26.977 --> 01:02:28.445
Are you Karina H.?

942
01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:30.247
I am. And who are you?

943
01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:32.416
My name is Liberty.

944
01:02:32.549 --> 01:02:36.020
This is Daisy. Michael.
Carleigh. Lailah. and Haven.

945
01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:37.721
Okay...

946
01:02:38.322 --> 01:02:40.357
We live in your old house.
on Crescent Avenue.

947
01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:46.931
We found
your old time capsule

948
01:02:47.064 --> 01:02:49.133
in the closet of
our house mother's room.

949
01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:52.803
See?

950
01:02:52.937 --> 01:02:54.872
And we took the map
that you had.

951
01:02:55.005 --> 01:02:57.574
and we went to
all the places on it.

952
01:02:59.209 --> 01:03:01.478
Except for the ranch.
It was closed.

953
01:03:02.579 --> 01:03:05.149
But then we found your
last letter in the fake rock.

954
01:03:05.282 --> 01:03:07.284
In this letter.
you told us to find you

955
01:03:07.417 --> 01:03:09.920
and invite you to the house
we love just as much as you.

956
01:03:10.888 --> 01:03:12.589
I got you. baby.

957
01:03:14.024 --> 01:03:16.393
<i>That's not the only reason
why we came.</i>

958
01:03:17.928 --> 01:03:19.163
<i>So there's more?</i>

959
01:03:21.798 --> 01:03:23.667
<i>We were wondering
if you could save the house.</i>

960
01:03:24.902 --> 01:03:26.770
<i>Well. what's going on
with the house?</i>

961
01:03:26.904 --> 01:03:29.473
<i>Well. Ms. Kay.
she's the woman that owns it.</i>

962
01:03:29.606 --> 01:03:31.441
<i>And our house mother.</i>

963
01:03:31.575 --> 01:03:34.344
<i>She's tired of taking
care of us. so she sold it.</i>

964
01:03:34.478 --> 01:03:36.480
<i>And in some days.</i>

965
01:03:36.613 --> 01:03:39.316
<i>Child Services will come and
split me and my brother up.</i>

966
01:03:39.449 --> 01:03:40.985
<i>Okay. and what are you saying</i>

967
01:03:41.118 --> 01:03:42.819
<i>that I'm supposed
to do about that?</i>

968
01:03:42.953 --> 01:03:44.421
<i>But you said
you loved that house.</i>

969
01:03:44.554 --> 01:03:45.956
<i>Yeah. and I was a kid.</i>

970
01:03:46.090 --> 01:03:48.158
<i>But love
doesn't go away.</i>

971
01:03:48.292 --> 01:03:49.994
<i>You said you wanted
to come back. you said--</i>

972
01:03:50.127 --> 01:03:52.596
<i>Listen. kid.
these letters you found.</i>

973
01:03:52.729 --> 01:03:54.664
<i>I wrote when I was
ten years old.</i>

974
01:03:55.399 --> 01:03:58.869
<i>And I'm a grown woman now
with my own house.</i>

975
01:04:00.737 --> 01:04:03.507
<i>I don't know you. and
I don't know how you found me.</i>

976
01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:05.309
<i>which is slightly scary.</i>

977
01:04:05.442 --> 01:04:07.477
<i>But bottom line is.
I can't help you. kid.</i>

978
01:04:07.611 --> 01:04:10.647
<i>Karina H.. please!
- Ms. Reena.</i>

979
01:04:13.617 --> 01:04:16.053
- Did you call me today?
- That was me.

980
01:04:16.653 --> 01:04:18.555
I'm only gonna
tell you kids this once.

981
01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:21.825
Don't contact me.
and don't come back here.

982
01:04:52.957 --> 01:04:54.191
Leave it alone. Carleigh.

983
01:04:55.392 --> 01:04:56.826
This is all your fault.

984
01:04:57.494 --> 01:04:58.728
What?

985
01:04:58.862 --> 01:05:00.364
You got our hopes up.

986
01:05:00.497 --> 01:05:02.566
You made us go searching
for that woman.

987
01:05:02.699 --> 01:05:05.502
You made us believe that
she was actually gonna save us.

988
01:05:06.503 --> 01:05:07.904
You made us look stupid.

989
01:05:08.038 --> 01:05:10.374
- I-- I didn't.
- You did.

990
01:05:10.507 --> 01:05:11.908
What?

991
01:05:12.542 --> 01:05:15.612
I believed in you because
you believed in Karina H.

992
01:05:16.846 --> 01:05:18.882
We followed
her trails and her signs.

993
01:05:19.016 --> 01:05:20.717
For nothing.

994
01:05:20.850 --> 01:05:22.552
Now they're probably gonna
split me and my brother up

995
01:05:22.686 --> 01:05:24.921
- because of you.
- What about Lailah and Daisy?

996
01:05:25.055 --> 01:05:26.523
You didn't think about them.

997
01:05:26.656 --> 01:05:29.059
All you were
thinking about was yourself.

998
01:05:32.429 --> 01:05:34.398
I didn't--
I didn't sell the house.

999
01:05:34.531 --> 01:05:35.899
I'm not the reason.

1000
01:05:36.366 --> 01:05:37.701
Why did you
even come here?

1001
01:05:38.668 --> 01:05:42.139
Ever since you arrived.
she didn't want us anymore.

1002
01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:45.709
- Get out.
- What?

1003
01:05:45.842 --> 01:05:47.311
Get out!

1004
01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:29.686
Liberty. Again?

1005
01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:31.655
Honey. if you wanna
stay in the bathroom.

1006
01:06:31.788 --> 01:06:32.822
you should've said that.

1007
01:06:32.956 --> 01:06:34.291
Come on. get up.

1008
01:06:34.424 --> 01:06:36.160
Go on downstairs
and find your friends.

1009
01:06:36.293 --> 01:06:38.262
I got an announcement to make.

1010
01:06:38.395 --> 01:06:39.796
You know I gotta get in here.

1011
01:07:06.190 --> 01:07:07.791
What's up?
What happened?

1012
01:07:09.259 --> 01:07:11.061
Why's everybody
just sitting here like this?

1013
01:07:11.928 --> 01:07:12.996
What's going on?

1014
01:07:14.331 --> 01:07:16.866
Oh. good. you're here. Sit down.
It's for all of you.

1015
01:07:18.102 --> 01:07:19.836
I got great news!

1016
01:07:19.969 --> 01:07:22.339
We got a new buyer
for the house!

1017
01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:26.009
Nothing. Okay.
Even better news.

1018
01:07:26.143 --> 01:07:28.312
they want the house
by the end of next week.

1019
01:07:29.179 --> 01:07:31.014
Next week?
What am I supposed to do?

1020
01:07:31.648 --> 01:07:33.049
So glad you asked.

1021
01:07:33.183 --> 01:07:34.818
Your last day here
is next Friday.

1022
01:07:34.951 --> 01:07:36.820
What about the kids. Kay?

1023
01:07:36.953 --> 01:07:39.089
If you wanna discuss this.

1024
01:07:39.223 --> 01:07:41.691
my office hours
are between nine and five.

1025
01:07:41.825 --> 01:07:43.527
- It's ten.
Okay.

1026
01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:45.595
I just didn't wanna do this
in front of their faces.

1027
01:07:45.729 --> 01:07:47.264
No. they need to know
what's going on.

1028
01:07:47.397 --> 01:07:49.065
They need to know
what's gonna happen to them.

1029
01:07:49.199 --> 01:07:51.935
They're not new to this.
This is not their first rodeo.

1030
01:07:52.969 --> 01:07:54.271
Well. I mean.
it is for this one.

1031
01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:56.940
Yes. Miss Liberty
and justice for all.

1032
01:07:57.073 --> 01:07:59.042
What happens to us next Friday?

1033
01:07:59.176 --> 01:08:01.678
Okay. so the people
who dropped you off.

1034
01:08:01.811 --> 01:08:03.713
they're gonna come back
and pick you up.

1035
01:08:03.847 --> 01:08:06.416
and then they're gonna drop you
off somewhere that's not here.

1036
01:08:06.983 --> 01:08:08.685
Yeah. me and you
need to talk in your office.

1037
01:08:08.818 --> 01:08:10.187
Okay. Is this about your pay?

1038
01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:11.688
I could pay through the month.

1039
01:08:12.156 --> 01:08:13.890
I don't wanna leave again.

1040
01:08:17.026 --> 01:08:19.129
Come on. Daisy.
Let's start packing.

1041
01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:22.799
I'd rather be doing chores.

- Hey. Pa. You up?
- Hey. baby girl.

1062
01:11:01.358 --> 01:11:03.427
I'm up.

1063
01:11:05.895 --> 01:11:07.297
You got my sweets?

1064
01:11:07.897 --> 01:11:10.567
No. they confiscated 'em
at the door.

1065
01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:12.201
I'm sorry.

1066
01:11:13.570 --> 01:11:16.973
They just don't want me to be
happy here. I'm telling you.

1067
01:11:22.011 --> 01:11:23.613
But why you look so down?

1068
01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:26.249
I don't know.
This new job.

1069
01:11:27.717 --> 01:11:32.121
I saw you on the TV
in that high-powered suit.

1070
01:11:33.056 --> 01:11:35.759
Looking sharp as ever. huh?

1071
01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:39.829
Yeah. I-- I don't know.

1072
01:11:40.764 --> 01:11:41.898
Eh?

1073
01:11:43.367 --> 01:11:44.734
What is it. baby girl?

1074
01:11:46.202 --> 01:11:48.572
I don't know.
It is a lot of money.

1075
01:11:49.873 --> 01:11:51.475
And it is a good opportunity.

1076
01:11:52.442 --> 01:11:54.678
I could be a junior partner
in less than a year.

1077
01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:56.079
The Vegas branch.

1078
01:11:57.947 --> 01:11:59.516
Junior partner is good.

1079
01:12:01.451 --> 01:12:02.519
Very.

1080
01:12:03.119 --> 01:12:05.288
Sounds like everything
you've ever wanted.

1081
01:12:06.623 --> 01:12:07.791
Isn't it?

1082
01:12:08.658 --> 01:12:10.159
Why am I not happy?

1083
01:12:11.795 --> 01:12:15.465
Like. why do I feel like I
didn't make the right decision?

1084
01:12:20.136 --> 01:12:21.204
Girl...

1085
01:12:22.105 --> 01:12:25.174
you didn't seem to like
the last job you had either.

1086
01:12:25.909 --> 01:12:30.179
But maybe law isn't for you.

1087
01:12:35.351 --> 01:12:38.855
I'm sorry I couldn't take
care of you before mom died.

1088
01:12:38.988 --> 01:12:41.224
No. Dad. No. it's okay.

1089
01:12:42.626 --> 01:12:44.628
Fought the courts
like crazy to prove

1090
01:12:44.761 --> 01:12:48.131
I can be a fit
and capable father.

1091
01:12:49.433 --> 01:12:53.470
Even selling the house
on Crescent Street.

1092
01:12:54.137 --> 01:12:58.007
the one we loved so much.
to pay for all the lawyers.

1093
01:12:59.342 --> 01:13:04.013
But as much as my mind
wanted to take care of you...

1094
01:13:05.181 --> 01:13:08.051
my body and sickness
said otherwise.

1095
01:13:10.454 --> 01:13:13.156
Sorry I couldn't
be there for you

1096
01:13:13.289 --> 01:13:15.759
when you needed me to be.

1097
01:13:18.795 --> 01:13:20.196
You wanna hear something crazy?

1098
01:13:23.132 --> 01:13:25.201
A group of kids
came to my door

1099
01:13:25.334 --> 01:13:28.171
and they said they followed
our scavenger hunt.

1100
01:13:28.304 --> 01:13:30.440
and it led 'em
all the way to my doorstep.

1101
01:13:31.541 --> 01:13:32.742
Can you believe that?

1102
01:13:33.477 --> 01:13:34.911
It's been 25 years.

1103
01:13:39.215 --> 01:13:42.051
- You got to be kidding.
-  No.

1104
01:13:42.185 --> 01:13:44.253
Uh-uh.

1105
01:13:44.387 --> 01:13:46.723
Yeah.

1106
01:13:46.856 --> 01:13:50.627
I remember you begging me

1107
01:13:51.728 --> 01:13:55.899
to take you all over Vegas
to leave them clues.

1108
01:13:56.032 --> 01:13:58.101
- Mm-hmm. Hmm.

1109
01:13:58.735 --> 01:14:00.604
25 years.

1110
01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:04.641
Can't believe
it's lasted a lifetime.

1111
01:14:08.377 --> 01:14:09.713
Well. Dad.

1112
01:14:10.747 --> 01:14:13.316
you always told me
everything happens for a reason.

1113
01:14:16.219 --> 01:14:21.390
I hope you gave them a heck
of a prize for finding you.

1114
01:14:31.535 --> 01:14:32.769
I got to go. Dad.

1115
01:14:34.137 --> 01:14:35.471
I'll be back.

1116
01:14:35.605 --> 01:14:37.741
- You're coming back?
Yeah.

1117
01:14:39.375 --> 01:14:40.476
Wait!

1118
01:14:42.278 --> 01:14:44.280
Let me get out this bed.

1119
01:14:51.555 --> 01:14:52.989
Bright and early. I see.

1120
01:14:54.123 --> 01:14:56.259
I'm afraid I have to
remove myself from the team.

1121
01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:01.130
Uh. Reena. let's
talk about this in my office.

1122
01:15:01.264 --> 01:15:03.933
I'm sorry. but I don't have
time. This has to happen now.

1123
01:15:04.067 --> 01:15:07.637
Karina.
think about your future here.

1124
01:15:07.771 --> 01:15:10.306
Yes. and I have.
And I'm making the choice

1125
01:15:10.439 --> 01:15:11.808
to going back to
working for the state.

1126
01:15:11.941 --> 01:15:13.309
because there's
a group of children

1127
01:15:13.442 --> 01:15:15.211
who need me more than you do.

1128
01:15:17.013 --> 01:15:19.182
Mrs. Hyatt.
you have an ex-husband

1129
01:15:19.315 --> 01:15:21.117
who honestly
loves your daughter.

1130
01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:24.821
And coming from a place where
children are ripped from

1131
01:15:24.954 --> 01:15:27.356
the only home
they've ever known daily...

1132
01:15:28.091 --> 01:15:29.392
you should consider yourself

1133
01:15:29.525 --> 01:15:31.628
and your daughter
extremely lucky.

1134
01:15:32.428 --> 01:15:34.063
No one knows
what tomorrow may bring.

1135
01:15:34.197 --> 01:15:35.565
and there's children
in the system

1136
01:15:35.699 --> 01:15:37.701
who know that
better than anybody else.

1137
01:15:38.835 --> 01:15:40.837
So I implore you
to do the right thing

1138
01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:42.906
and allow your ex-husband
to spend as much time

1139
01:15:43.039 --> 01:15:44.574
with your daughter
as he wants.

1140
01:15:45.308 --> 01:15:47.410
I'm sorry.
but I have to go.

1141
01:15:50.614 --> 01:15:53.416
All checked in.
Where are your case. workers?

1142
01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:55.084
I got a flight to catch.

1143
01:15:56.953 --> 01:15:59.222
Finally!

1144
01:15:59.355 --> 01:16:00.690
Hey. what you doing here?

1145
01:16:00.824 --> 01:16:02.225
I came so at least
these kids know

1146
01:16:02.358 --> 01:16:03.492
that somebody cares about 'em.

1147
01:16:06.195 --> 01:16:09.699
Aww. that's so cute.
You wanna take them with you?

1148
01:16:12.702 --> 01:16:14.103
All right. here we go!

1149
01:16:14.738 --> 01:16:16.005
Hey. who's caseworker are you?

1150
01:16:16.139 --> 01:16:18.842
Mmm. funny thing.
I'm nobody's.

1151
01:16:19.876 --> 01:16:21.110
Okay. then. who are you?

1152
01:16:21.244 --> 01:16:22.912
I'm the new owner
of this house.

1153
01:16:26.883 --> 01:16:29.886
It's just like I remember it.

1154
01:16:30.019 --> 01:16:33.189
Remember it?
- Yes. remember it.

1155
01:16:34.323 --> 01:16:36.059
I grew up in this house.

1156
01:16:36.192 --> 01:16:38.227
Oh. honey.
this house ain't that old.

1157
01:16:40.764 --> 01:16:41.865
Cute.

1158
01:16:45.368 --> 01:16:48.237
- Ms. Liberty.
- Ms. Karina?

1159
01:16:48.371 --> 01:16:50.473
Karina? Hold up.
I didn't sell this house

1160
01:16:50.606 --> 01:16:52.541
to no Karina. I don't know
what kind of game--

1161
01:16:52.676 --> 01:16:55.311
I bought the Smiths out.

1162
01:16:55.912 --> 01:16:56.980
Oh.

1163
01:16:58.514 --> 01:17:00.049
So how you know Liberty. hmm?

1164
01:17:00.183 --> 01:17:02.451
I got a visit from
these children last week.

1165
01:17:02.585 --> 01:17:05.588
These kids?
- Mm-hmm. These kids.

1166
01:17:05.722 --> 01:17:07.757
The gold.
Gold?

1167
01:17:08.858 --> 01:17:10.459
What gold?

1168
01:17:11.527 --> 01:17:13.329
<i>You know.
when the kids showed up</i>

1169
01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:16.332
<i>to my doorstep last week.
I honestly didn't even remember</i>

1170
01:17:16.465 --> 01:17:18.234
<i>what they were talking about.</i>

1171
01:17:18.367 --> 01:17:21.938
<i>It's been 25 years
since I've seen that letter.</i>

1172
01:17:22.071 --> 01:17:24.774
<i>What letter?
The scavenger hunt.</i>

1173
01:17:24.908 --> 01:17:27.076
<i>You know.
I had to sit down with myself</i>

1174
01:17:27.210 --> 01:17:29.913
<i>and remember
what it felt like to be a kid.</i>

1175
01:17:30.046 --> 01:17:32.782
<i>and I realized
how rude I was to these kids</i>

1176
01:17:32.916 --> 01:17:36.285
<i>who shared that same feelings
that I once did.</i>

1177
01:17:37.053 --> 01:17:39.255
<i>And I didn't know
how to make it up to them.</i>

1178
01:17:39.388 --> 01:17:41.124
<i>The only thing
that I could think of</i>

1179
01:17:41.257 --> 01:17:43.026
<i>was to honor their request.</i>

1180
01:17:43.159 --> 01:17:44.327
<i>Request?</i>

1181
01:17:45.528 --> 01:17:48.464
Yes. The kids asked me
to save the house.

1182
01:17:48.597 --> 01:17:50.433
Well. you may be able
to save this house.

1183
01:17:50.566 --> 01:17:52.201
but these kids
are out of here.

1184
01:17:52.335 --> 01:17:54.603
Mmm. right.
That's another thing.

1185
01:17:54.738 --> 01:17:58.374
I'm an attorney.
and this house is zoned

1186
01:17:58.507 --> 01:18:02.779
and listed as a home for youth.
and I will not be changing that.

1187
01:18:04.781 --> 01:18:07.183
- You must be Mr. Pierce.
- I am.

1188
01:18:07.316 --> 01:18:09.185
How would you like
to run this house?

1189
01:18:09.318 --> 01:18:11.721
I heard that you're on
the market for a new job.

1190
01:18:11.855 --> 01:18:13.723
I'd like that.

1191
01:18:13.857 --> 01:18:16.025
Well. the social workers are
on the way for these kids. so--

1192
01:18:16.159 --> 01:18:17.861
I can assure you they're not.

1193
01:18:20.429 --> 01:18:24.067
And I owe each
and every one of you an apology.

1194
01:18:25.468 --> 01:18:27.070
Especially you. Liberty.

1195
01:18:28.637 --> 01:18:30.840
You may have asked me
to save this house.

1196
01:18:30.974 --> 01:18:34.343
but you've done more for me than
I could have ever done for you.

1197
01:18:35.144 --> 01:18:37.646
And thank you for reminding me
of what's important.

1198
01:18:38.347 --> 01:18:41.250
- So we aren't leaving?
- Nope.

1199
01:18:41.384 --> 01:18:43.152
And you're not gonna
split me and my brother up?

1200
01:18:43.286 --> 01:18:45.521
- Nope.
- And we're not gonna move?

1201
01:18:45.654 --> 01:18:46.722
Nope.

1202
01:18:50.526 --> 01:18:52.261
We should apologize too.

1203
01:18:52.395 --> 01:18:53.462
To who?

1204
01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:56.766
- Liberty.
- What happened?

1205
01:18:58.902 --> 01:19:00.904
We haven't been
the best friends we could.

1206
01:19:01.871 --> 01:19:02.939
I was wrong.

1207
01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:06.375
This wasn't your fault.
It was never your fault.

1208
01:19:07.243 --> 01:19:09.278
I was just afraid
I was gonna lose my brother.
