00:00:13.317 --> 00:00:16.755
<i>Here comes Lucky!</i>

4
00:00:16.886 --> 00:00:19.845
<i>And they're off. Number 7.
Sandy's Rocket. out front.</i>

5
00:00:19.976 --> 00:00:22.239
<i>Right behind him
by the three against the rail</i>

6
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.415
<i>as they head down
the front stretch...</i>

7
00:00:30.856 --> 00:00:34.034
<i>Number 7. Sandy's Rocket.
in control now.</i>

8
00:00:34.164 --> 00:00:35.687
<i>Down the backstretch...</i>

9
00:00:39.952 --> 00:00:42.085
Look at all this
fucking coin. dude.

10
00:00:45.523 --> 00:00:47.525
- A.J.. where's the capper?
- Shredded. Back in VIP.

11
00:00:47.656 --> 00:00:48.961
Look who's Big Money in seven.

12
00:00:50.615 --> 00:00:52.878
- No fucking way. Moose.
- Yes fucking way. We're red-hot.

13
00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:54.532
- Don't shit on our streak.
- I'm not shitting on our streak.

14
00:00:54.663 --> 00:00:56.578
You're shitting all over
our streak big time.

15
00:00:56.708 --> 00:00:58.623
"Four runs and we bone out."
Those were your exact words.

16
00:00:58.754 --> 00:01:01.235
Yeah. and Big Money in six
was a fucking game changer.

17
00:01:02.714 --> 00:01:04.194
- It's two o'clock.
- It's five 'til.

18
00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:06.153
- Come on. we should bounce.
- Pensacola's already halfway

19
00:01:06.283 --> 00:01:08.459
- through the post parade. pussy.
- Dude. you're going rogue.

20
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.374
- Because you're being a pussy.
- Shut the f--

21
00:01:10.505 --> 00:01:12.159
Y'all fixing to place a bet?

22
00:01:12.811 --> 00:01:14.030
Just a sec. darling.

23
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.425
Come on. bitch. Look up there
and tell me who's Big Money.

24
00:01:25.128 --> 00:01:27.217
- Sweetchuck's our boy.
- Sweetchuck? Fuck you.

25
00:01:27.348 --> 00:01:28.827
Crowd's got wood
for Easy Does It.

26
00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.438
The crowd goes home
in a body bag. okay?

27
00:01:30.568 --> 00:01:33.223
Let's go straight bet.
No exotics. Let it ride.

28
00:01:33.354 --> 00:01:36.052
Fuck you! We're up three bills.
I'm not letting it ride.

29
00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.924
Now who's the pussy?

30
00:01:42.798 --> 00:01:43.842
Get the fucking cab.

31
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.108
All right.
<i>And they're off.</i>

32
00:01:52.068 --> 00:01:53.113
Gonna fuck it all up!

33
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.506
What the fuck. A.J.?

34
00:01:55.637 --> 00:01:57.508
<i>Sweetchuck hard-charging...</i>

35
00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:59.771
Pussy. Oh. fuck. Oh. my God.
He's breaking...

36
00:01:59.902 --> 00:02:01.251
Run! Run! Run! Come on!

37
00:02:01.382 --> 00:02:03.210
<i>Now he's two lengths ahead.</i>

38
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.603
Oh. shit! Here he comes!
Big money. money. money!

39
00:02:06.778 --> 00:02:08.476
<i>And it's Sweetchuck
at the wire!</i>

40
00:02:12.567 --> 00:02:16.658
Sweetchuck! Sweetchuck!

41
00:02:16.788 --> 00:02:18.225
No. no. no. no!
Moose. our cab!

42
00:02:18.355 --> 00:02:19.574
Some chud's ganking it.

43
00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:23.143
Oh. fuck!

44
00:02:23.273 --> 00:02:24.622
Now what are we supposed to do?

45
00:02:24.753 --> 00:02:26.233
We're screwed.

46
00:02:26.363 --> 00:02:28.626
Oh. what? You gonna run
across the river bridge?

47
00:02:30.933 --> 00:02:32.717
A.J.. it's the fucking
interstate!

48
00:02:32.848 --> 00:02:34.023
Fuck!

49
00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:35.285
Fuck!

50
00:02:36.634 --> 00:02:39.159
Hey! Hey. buddy!

51
00:02:40.551 --> 00:02:42.205
I got an easy 50!

52
00:02:46.514 --> 00:02:48.298
Whoa. whoa. whoa!
Stay in this lane!

53
00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:49.604
You almost hit that car!

54
00:02:49.734 --> 00:02:51.345
Fuck! Moose...

55
00:02:51.475 --> 00:02:53.042
All right. I need you to punch
this shitbox. all right?

56
00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:07.317
Moose. Moose...

57
00:03:12.583 --> 00:03:15.325
[boy] Come on! Come on!

58
00:03:28.817 --> 00:03:30.210
Where the heck
have you guys been?

59
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.124
We've been waiting
for 35 minutes.

60
00:03:32.255 --> 00:03:34.083
We got stuck on the train
by the Bongo habitat.

61
00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:36.390
Some kid had a grand mal seizure
and they shut it down.

62
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.609
- What could we do?
- Just get on the dang bus.

63
00:03:43.658 --> 00:03:45.007
Hey. butt fuck!

64
00:03:45.137 --> 00:03:46.748
You're both dead
if I'm late for practice.

65
00:03:46.878 --> 00:03:48.663
What practice. Randy?
You do wrestling and football.

66
00:03:48.793 --> 00:03:51.187
Yeah. it's fucking May. loser.

67
00:03:51.666 --> 00:03:52.841
Fuck off.

68
00:03:57.367 --> 00:03:58.977
All right. homeboy.
what are you feeling?

69
00:03:59.108 --> 00:04:00.936
Benjys and Grants
or Jackies and Hams?

70
00:04:02.677 --> 00:04:05.027
- Why're you doing the lip thing?
- I'm not doing a lip thing.

71
00:04:05.157 --> 00:04:07.290
Makes you look like you're
prepping to suck an asshole.

72
00:04:07.421 --> 00:04:09.814
No more wild-card shit.
You're breaking your own rules.

73
00:04:09.945 --> 00:04:11.468
Fuck off.
don't be such a basket case.

74
00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.688
Look at this epic
fucking split. dude!

75
00:04:13.818 --> 00:04:16.343
Goddamn it. I want to epic split
your fucking mouth.

76
00:04:16.473 --> 00:04:17.866
Yeah?
Why don't you try it. pussy?

77
00:04:20.085 --> 00:04:21.565
Because every chaperone
on this bus

78
00:04:21.696 --> 00:04:23.088
is fucking staring at us.

79
00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:24.307
What?

80
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:33.403
- Yo. question.
- Yeah. dude?

81
00:04:34.404 --> 00:04:35.710
Who'd you like in the 8th?

82
00:04:39.453 --> 00:04:40.758
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

83
00:04:41.803 --> 00:04:43.195
Ooh. what's the wort at?

84
00:04:43.326 --> 00:04:45.328
Uh. it's at 69 degrees.

85
00:04:45.459 --> 00:04:47.635
All right. let's pitch
the fucking yeast

86
00:04:47.765 --> 00:04:49.245
and put her to bed.

87
00:04:51.421 --> 00:04:52.901
Home sweet home.

88
00:04:53.031 --> 00:04:54.337
Squeeze that airlock in.

89
00:04:55.382 --> 00:04:56.948
- Is that one leaking?
- Brand-new tub.

90
00:04:57.079 --> 00:04:58.428
How could it be leaking?

91
00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:00.082
Let's check the pH
on the lagers.

92
00:05:01.605 --> 00:05:03.694
Booyah. What are you feeling?

93
00:05:04.913 --> 00:05:06.088
Let's go pilsner.

94
00:05:09.787 --> 00:05:11.180
- Cheers.
- Cheers. dude.

95
00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:12.355
Whoa.

96
00:05:12.834 --> 00:05:13.878
Looks bright.

97
00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:15.489
Spritzy.

98
00:05:17.012 --> 00:05:18.796
Mm. Wow.

99
00:05:18.927 --> 00:05:21.712
Yeah. I know. dude.
We fucking made that!

100
00:05:21.843 --> 00:05:24.541
- We made that!
- This is. like. real beer.

101
00:05:24.672 --> 00:05:26.630
Mm! Let's go with that.

102
00:05:26.761 --> 00:05:28.240
- What?
- Real Beer. For the label.

103
00:05:28.371 --> 00:05:29.851
I found a printer
in Tecumseh.

104
00:05:29.981 --> 00:05:31.418
They can bang them out
for two cents a pop.

105
00:05:31.548 --> 00:05:33.420
I dig it.

106
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.117
All right. so. look. man.
I want to pitch you an idea.

107
00:05:35.247 --> 00:05:36.292
Okay. hit me.

108
00:05:36.858 --> 00:05:38.512
It's time to expand
the operation.

109
00:05:38.642 --> 00:05:40.035
All right. so look. dude.

110
00:05:40.165 --> 00:05:41.515
we're sitting on a cash cow
with Real Beer.

111
00:05:41.645 --> 00:05:43.038
Fifteen gallons a month
is baby stuff

112
00:05:43.168 --> 00:05:44.344
compared to what we could do

113
00:05:44.474 --> 00:05:45.780
if we scaled her up
to a buck twenty.

114
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.259
- A hundred and twenty gallons?
- A month. dude.

115
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:48.826
And we'll cash flow
our day-to-day ops

116
00:05:48.957 --> 00:05:50.306
with our track winnings
until we get to a rhythm

117
00:05:50.437 --> 00:05:51.655
where this thing
is running itself.

118
00:05:51.786 --> 00:05:53.701
Moose. we haven't
even sold a single beer.

119
00:05:53.831 --> 00:05:56.530
Yet. You gotta learn
to forecast. bitch.

120
00:05:57.574 --> 00:05:58.923
Fuck!

121
00:05:59.054 --> 00:06:01.317
We hit two matinees a week.
we're solid gold.

122
00:06:01.448 --> 00:06:03.232
Two? We'd be lucky to scrounge
up a ride every two weeks.

123
00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:05.234
Pause.
Don't worry about transpo.

124
00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:07.454
Transpo's my turf.
And we'll circle back in a sec.

125
00:06:07.584 --> 00:06:09.847
A huge part of this operation
is figuring out

126
00:06:09.978 --> 00:06:11.283
the right foot soldiers
to bring in.

127
00:06:11.414 --> 00:06:12.981
What do you think
of Jason Beaumont?

128
00:06:13.111 --> 00:06:14.852
Dude. fucking kid's a narc.
He'd squeal for sure.

129
00:06:14.983 --> 00:06:17.855
Yeah! I love your instincts!
That's why you're gonna run HR.

130
00:06:17.986 --> 00:06:19.814
Handle all the recruiting.

131
00:06:21.859 --> 00:06:23.078
Fuck!

132
00:06:23.731 --> 00:06:24.862
That was a fucking neck shot!

133
00:06:24.993 --> 00:06:27.256
- Forecast.
- You said no fucking necks.

134
00:06:29.127 --> 00:06:30.259
So are we in agreement

135
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.652
that transpo's
our number one concern?

136
00:06:31.782 --> 00:06:33.001
Hundred percent.

137
00:06:33.131 --> 00:06:34.394
And until this operation's
got wheels.

138
00:06:34.524 --> 00:06:35.743
if feels like it's dead
in the water.

139
00:06:35.873 --> 00:06:37.266
Okay. hear me out.

140
00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:39.790
Fuck. these are awesome.

141
00:06:39.921 --> 00:06:41.401
Tom. we're good to go.

142
00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:44.099
Kip Langer's older brother.
You know him?

143
00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:46.580
- Darian?
- No. Darian's in Chrissy's class.

144
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.190
I'm talking about Gary.

145
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.931
With the lazy eye
and the gelled hair.

146
00:06:50.061 --> 00:06:51.454
- Oh. yeah. The DJ guy.
- Yeah.

147
00:06:51.585 --> 00:06:53.108
So he's got a limo thing
on the side. dude.

148
00:06:53.238 --> 00:06:55.197
Like weddings and proms.
all that type of shit.

149
00:06:55.937 --> 00:06:57.112
Thanks. Tom.

150
00:06:57.242 --> 00:06:58.505
You know what?

151
00:06:59.244 --> 00:07:00.637
Here's a little something
for you.

152
00:07:03.335 --> 00:07:05.686
So obviously. his rates
are premium on the weekends.

153
00:07:05.816 --> 00:07:07.514
because that's where
all the action is.

154
00:07:07.644 --> 00:07:10.038
But Monday through Thursday
is a total fucking dead zone.

155
00:07:10.168 --> 00:07:13.302
So I've got Gary locked in
at 25 bucks an hour.

156
00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:14.782
plus we gotta float the gas.

157
00:07:14.912 --> 00:07:16.653
But all he needs
is a three-hour heads-up.

158
00:07:16.784 --> 00:07:18.655
So you want to take a limo back
and forth between Bluffs Run?

159
00:07:18.786 --> 00:07:19.917
Yeah. twice a week.

160
00:07:20.048 --> 00:07:21.179
It'd be like a C-note
per run. max.

161
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.485
- That's it?
- That's fucking it. dude.

162
00:07:22.616 --> 00:07:24.095
It's actually
a really boss idea.

163
00:07:24.226 --> 00:07:25.967
It's airtight. bitch.
I knew you'd be all over it.

164
00:07:28.578 --> 00:07:30.450
This fucker's
double O-C too.

165
00:07:31.712 --> 00:07:32.887
Huh?

166
00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:34.845
Fucking limo. asshole.

167
00:07:34.976 --> 00:07:37.108
It's got a 13-inch TV
with a built-in VHS.

168
00:07:37.239 --> 00:07:39.284
Mini wet bar.
Motorola bag phone.

169
00:07:39.415 --> 00:07:40.547
Why would we need
a bag phone?

170
00:07:40.677 --> 00:07:41.852
In case we gotta move
on some shit

171
00:07:41.983 --> 00:07:43.245
and we don't have time
to hit a payphone.

172
00:07:43.375 --> 00:07:44.681
Look. stop fixating
on the bag phone.

173
00:07:44.812 --> 00:07:46.335
- Are you in or you out?
- I'm in.

174
00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:48.076
- I'm in. yeah.
- All right. I'll set it up.

175
00:07:49.033 --> 00:07:50.339
Oh. buddy.
we're gonna be rolling

176
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.123

[A.J.] Yo. I'm home.

187
00:08:25.113 --> 00:08:28.246
Mm. Mrs. C..
these deer chops are banging.

188
00:08:33.861 --> 00:08:34.862
What's going on?

189
00:08:34.992 --> 00:08:36.385
How was the field trip. boys?

190
00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:37.821
Oh. like the best ever.

191
00:08:37.952 --> 00:08:39.475
Yeah. we got to hand-feed
the giraffes.

192
00:08:39.606 --> 00:08:41.303
Yeah. the sucker was eating
right out of our palm.

193
00:08:47.352 --> 00:08:50.051
Speaking of hands.
let me smell those hands.

194
00:08:50.181 --> 00:08:51.226
Jesus. what?

195
00:08:51.966 --> 00:08:53.445
No. Why?

196
00:08:53.576 --> 00:08:55.056
Are you trying
to hide something from us?

197
00:08:55.186 --> 00:08:56.840
Oh. he is. Big time.

198
00:08:56.971 --> 00:08:59.321
No. no. I just don't want you
smelling my hands.

199
00:08:59.451 --> 00:09:01.366
It's weird.[Judge] It's not weird.

200
00:09:01.497 --> 00:09:03.499
It's just a set of hands. son.

201
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.936
Afraid we'll find out
about the cigarettes?

202
00:09:06.067 --> 00:09:07.721
Cigarettes? We--

203
00:09:07.851 --> 00:09:10.158
Mr. Rubenking said
he saw you and Moose

204
00:09:10.288 --> 00:09:11.986
smoking cigarettes
in the VIP area

205
00:09:12.116 --> 00:09:14.075
of I-80 OTB this afternoon.

206
00:09:14.205 --> 00:09:15.467
I-80 OTB?

207
00:09:15.598 --> 00:09:16.904
It's an off-track
betting parlor.

208
00:09:17.034 --> 00:09:18.253
In Council Bluffs. Iowa.

209
00:09:18.383 --> 00:09:19.820
Right across the river bridge

210
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:22.649
from the Henry Doorly Zoo.

211
00:09:22.779 --> 00:09:25.390
Smoking cigarettes
and going berserk!

212
00:09:25.521 --> 00:09:27.262
He emphasized "berserk."

213
00:09:27.392 --> 00:09:29.786
And the damn neon shirts!

214
00:09:30.439 --> 00:09:31.875
Awful quiet. Moose.

215
00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:36.053
Did you get those fancy shoes
with your gambling winnings?

216
00:09:36.184 --> 00:09:38.403
Guilty!
- Moose...

217
00:09:40.362 --> 00:09:41.755
Chrissy. go to your room.

218
00:09:41.885 --> 00:09:44.148
- No way.
- In your room. young lady.

219
00:09:44.279 --> 00:09:45.367
Ugh!

220
00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:48.196
- Witness stand.
- No.

221
00:09:48.326 --> 00:09:49.719
No. I'm not...

222
00:09:50.981 --> 00:09:52.548
There's been
a pattern with you two.

223
00:09:52.679 --> 00:09:54.724
- An escalation.
- A very dangerous escalation.

224
00:09:54.855 --> 00:09:56.857
- We're not escalating.
- Illegally crossing state lines

225
00:09:56.987 --> 00:09:59.294
to hang out at an off-track
betting parlor?

226
00:09:59.424 --> 00:10:00.643
We're not hanging out.
We're working.

227
00:10:00.774 --> 00:10:02.166
- Working!
- Oh. my God!

228
00:10:02.297 --> 00:10:04.560
- You're not a pro gambler!
- Are you two doing dope?

229
00:10:04.691 --> 00:10:06.127
Okay. no on the dope.

230
00:10:06.301 --> 00:10:07.998
and no. I'm not gonna become
a professional gambler.

231
00:10:08.129 --> 00:10:10.740
You two idiots are gonna end up
in a double funeral

232
00:10:10.871 --> 00:10:13.047
or on the side
of a fricking milk carton.

233
00:10:13.177 --> 00:10:16.833
Is it Moose? Is he the one that
talks you into this crazy stuff?

234
00:10:16.964 --> 00:10:18.443
No. it's not Moose.
I came up with the system.

235
00:10:18.574 --> 00:10:20.620
The system? What is the system?

236
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.273
A secret system
for big-money long shots.

237
00:10:22.404 --> 00:10:24.101
You're 14 years old!

238
00:10:24.232 --> 00:10:26.060
You don't have
a fricking system!

239
00:10:33.676 --> 00:10:36.026
Dude. I am so fucking sorry.

240
00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.594
The Judge started doing
the lip thing.

241
00:10:38.725 --> 00:10:41.336
and I just fucking panicked.

242
00:10:41.466 --> 00:10:43.033
Did you tell them
about the system?

243
00:10:43.164 --> 00:10:44.731
They don't want to hear
about Big Money. Moose.

244
00:10:44.861 --> 00:10:46.167
I'm grounded.

245
00:10:46.297 --> 00:10:48.038
Banned from the track
and banned from Iowa.

246
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.867
Oh. Jesus fucking Christ. dude.

247
00:10:51.694 --> 00:10:53.609
This rat-fucks
our whole plan.

248
00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.393
There is no plan.
We're done.

249
00:10:56.394 --> 00:10:58.962
No more running free range.
They're shutting us down.

250
00:10:59.093 --> 00:11:00.877
I've got one week
to find a legit job

251
00:11:01.008 --> 00:11:02.400
before my mom goes
full-tilt DEFCON.

252
00:11:02.531 --> 00:11:04.011
Full tilt? What do you mean?

253
00:11:04.141 --> 00:11:05.534
Baseball.
Bible camp.

254
00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:07.275
Weekends at her auction crew.

255
00:11:07.405 --> 00:11:10.234
Fuck your mom's auction crew.
Shit pay.

256
00:11:10.365 --> 00:11:12.672
Tell her we're not signing on
for three bucks an hour.

257
00:11:12.802 --> 00:11:14.412
She made no mention
of hiring you.

258
00:11:16.893 --> 00:11:19.287
We're a package deal. A.J.
You don't break up the band.

259
00:11:21.158 --> 00:11:22.769
Look. just circle
the heavy hitters. okay?

260
00:11:22.899 --> 00:11:24.727
Don't waste your time
with that entry-level slop.

261
00:11:24.858 --> 00:11:26.686
- I'm not.
- Dude. don't worry.

262
00:11:26.816 --> 00:11:28.818
Tomorrow after school.
we'll get some shit lined up.

263
00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:30.124
Easy peasy.

264
00:11:31.212 --> 00:11:32.604
All right?

265
00:11:32.735 --> 00:11:34.345
- See ya. pussy.
- See ya.

266
00:12:30.401 --> 00:12:32.577
What if we doubled
the batch?

267
00:12:32.708 --> 00:12:34.057
And then had only
one foot soldier

268
00:12:34.188 --> 00:12:36.233
instead of an entire roster
of guys to manage?

269
00:12:36.364 --> 00:12:37.931
Fuck me. you really want
to hobby brew?

270
00:12:38.061 --> 00:12:40.585
No--Look. the company's fucked.

271
00:12:40.716 --> 00:12:42.936
We're never gonna cash-flow
this thing with minimum wage

272
00:12:43.066 --> 00:12:44.589
and suck-ass hours.

273
00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.939
Excuse me.

274
00:12:53.033 --> 00:12:55.122
Pass the sack.
I got dibs on that last one.

275
00:12:55.252 --> 00:12:56.906
Fuck you.
The big boy's mine.

276
00:12:57.037 --> 00:12:58.168
Give it to me.

277
00:12:58.299 --> 00:13:00.780
It's my money.
it's my gizzard.

278
00:13:03.695 --> 00:13:05.175
Fuck. dude. My neck!

279
00:13:05.306 --> 00:13:06.829
Forecast.

280
00:13:09.832 --> 00:13:12.792
Boom! Right in the breadbasket!

281
00:13:12.922 --> 00:13:15.925
And you fuckstains
are no Mike Rozier.

282
00:13:16.056 --> 00:13:17.709
Is it piss?

283
00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.016
Straight from the tap.
sweet cheeks.

284
00:13:20.147 --> 00:13:22.410
You two dip fucks better grow
eyes in the back of your head.

285
00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:24.499
High school's gonna be
a fucking meat grinder!

286
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:26.283
It's open season. limp dicks.

287
00:13:26.414 --> 00:13:28.546
You never know when.
you never know where.

288
00:13:28.677 --> 00:13:31.375
- Pussies!
- Whoo!

289
00:13:41.255 --> 00:13:42.778
You boys all right?

290
00:13:44.258 --> 00:13:45.781
That's piss. ain't it?

291
00:13:48.044 --> 00:13:49.785
Yeah. it's piss.

292
00:13:56.313 --> 00:13:57.532
Holy shit!

293
00:13:58.489 --> 00:13:59.664
Shane!

294
00:13:59.795 --> 00:14:00.970
What the fuck?

295
00:14:01.101 --> 00:14:02.754
So much for one
weekend a month. huh?

296
00:14:02.885 --> 00:14:04.147
- Shotgun.
- No fucking way.

297
00:14:04.278 --> 00:14:05.279
Get in the back. mutant.

298
00:14:07.237 --> 00:14:08.369
What's up. Eagle?

299
00:14:11.894 --> 00:14:13.548
Fucking A...

300
00:14:13.678 --> 00:14:15.985
This is why you're in the back.

301
00:14:16.116 --> 00:14:18.770
Hold on to your fucking tits.

302
00:14:18.901 --> 00:14:20.511
Fuck the Carmichaels.

303
00:14:21.251 --> 00:14:23.253
Don't let those pussies
run a psyop on you.

304
00:14:23.384 --> 00:14:25.952
Rodney's a horror show. dude.
That Boz cut. those muscles.

305
00:14:26.082 --> 00:14:27.040
I mean...

306
00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:28.780
He's a fucking juicehead. Eagle.

307
00:14:28.911 --> 00:14:31.958
He used to bitch out
when I wrestled him at 160.

308
00:14:32.088 --> 00:14:34.612
Yo. Rambo?
Fucking waste anyone over there?

309
00:14:34.743 --> 00:14:36.876
The whole thing was over
in a hundred hours. dipshit.

310
00:14:37.006 --> 00:14:39.182
The only thing I wasted
was my freshman year.

311
00:14:39.835 --> 00:14:41.228
The town's still covered
in yellow.

312
00:14:41.358 --> 00:14:43.143
Maybe they'll give you
the keys to the city. dude.

313
00:14:43.273 --> 00:14:44.796
Shit. I'd settle for the keys
to the Toddy Shop.

314
00:14:44.927 --> 00:14:46.450
Old enough to die for Uncle Sam.

315
00:14:46.581 --> 00:14:48.322
but still can't buy
a fucking sixer.

316
00:14:48.452 --> 00:14:50.672
Yo. homey.
Do you want a beer?

317
00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:57.809
Fuck!

318
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:01.509
Seriously?

319
00:15:01.639 --> 00:15:03.076
You turds made this?

320
00:15:03.206 --> 00:15:04.338
Yeah.

321
00:15:05.556 --> 00:15:07.602
All right. so check it.
You gotta pour it like this.

322
00:15:07.732 --> 00:15:10.083
And don't drink the stuff
on the bottom.

323
00:15:11.519 --> 00:15:12.781
Copy that.

324
00:15:20.789 --> 00:15:21.877
Moment of truth.

325
00:15:28.144 --> 00:15:29.102
Well?

326
00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:31.931
Goddamn. fellas.

327
00:15:32.061 --> 00:15:33.410
It's not shit.

328
00:15:36.892 --> 00:15:39.242
- It's drinkable as fuck.
- Drinkable as fuck!

329
00:15:39.373 --> 00:15:40.809
Oh. yeah. dude!

330
00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.550
That's going on
the fucking sticker for sure!

331
00:15:45.205 --> 00:15:46.858
All. right. can we put you down
for a case?

332
00:15:47.903 --> 00:15:49.252
Whoo!

333
00:15:52.429 --> 00:15:53.865
Well. you know the rules.

334
00:15:54.779 --> 00:15:56.216
No glass on deck.

335
00:15:56.825 --> 00:15:58.740
Yes. sir.

336
00:16:13.885 --> 00:16:15.583
The water's piss-warm. dude.

337
00:16:15.713 --> 00:16:19.543
Yeah. Ron always cranks it
for the invitationals.

338
00:16:19.674 --> 00:16:21.502
Hey. we need to bag
some summer jobs.

339
00:16:21.632 --> 00:16:23.199
- You think you can hook us up?
- No.

340
00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.985
It's not gonna fly.
You gotta be 16 to guard.

341
00:16:26.115 --> 00:16:27.725
Ron might budge
on the Eagle Scout.

342
00:16:27.856 --> 00:16:29.684
but definitely
not on you.

343
00:16:29.814 --> 00:16:33.166
Well. fuck Ron. Fuck the pool.
Me and A.J. are a package deal.

344
00:16:33.296 --> 00:16:36.212
Shit. you can ask the Bravo boys
if they need an extra hand.

345
00:16:36.343 --> 00:16:37.909
With what?

346
00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.346
They're planning on running
that thing this summer.

347
00:16:39.476 --> 00:16:41.565
What thing?
- That thing.

348
00:16:42.305 --> 00:16:43.828
The Snack Shack.

349
00:16:44.916 --> 00:16:47.876
So does their family.
like. own it or something?

350
00:16:48.007 --> 00:16:49.095
No. Bravos don't own it.
City owns it.

351
00:16:49.225 --> 00:16:50.357
Yo. toss me your keys.

352
00:16:50.487 --> 00:16:52.272
I want to see
inside that fucker.

353
00:16:52.402 --> 00:16:53.708
Don't have any.

354
00:16:53.838 --> 00:16:55.144
Snack Shack's totally
separate from the pool.

355
00:16:55.275 --> 00:16:57.016
Okay. so they rent it
from the city?

356
00:16:57.146 --> 00:16:59.105
No. I think it gets bid out
through Parks & Rec.

357
00:16:59.235 --> 00:17:01.803
- Okay. how's that work?
- I don't know. dude.

358
00:17:01.933 --> 00:17:03.283
I think they bid it out

359
00:17:03.413 --> 00:17:04.936
at the city council
meeting tomorrow.

360
00:17:05.067 --> 00:17:06.721
How much the Bravos
throw down on that sucker?

361
00:17:06.851 --> 00:17:09.419
Ask them. They're gonna be
at the sunken lot tonight.

362
00:17:15.469 --> 00:17:17.210
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

363
00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:19.908
That we hit the sunken lot.
dump some beer.

364
00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:21.866
get intel on
the Bravo boys' bid.

365
00:17:21.997 --> 00:17:24.173
then rat-fuck them at the city
council meeting tomorrow night.

366
00:18:18.532 --> 00:18:20.708
Yo! Shit pig.

367
00:18:21.448 --> 00:18:22.492
You all right?

368
00:18:23.145 --> 00:18:25.321
Huh? Me?

369
00:18:25.452 --> 00:18:27.758
Yeah. You. like.
having a fit or something?

370
00:18:27.889 --> 00:18:30.848
Oh. It's just allergies.
It's like...

371
00:18:30.979 --> 00:18:33.982
- Allergies?
- Grass. pollen. ragw--

372
00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:35.853
Yeah. like the movie about
the kid in the plastic bubble?

373
00:18:35.984 --> 00:18:38.378
No. No. it's not
like him at all.

374
00:18:38.508 --> 00:18:39.509
- I'm nothing like that.
- Yeah. right.

375
00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.207
Seriously.

376
00:18:43.122 --> 00:18:44.775
Oh. God. you are
totally like him.

377
00:18:44.906 --> 00:18:45.907
Sorry.

378
00:18:46.908 --> 00:18:48.866
What is that?

379
00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:50.651
My hanky?

380
00:18:52.087 --> 00:18:53.610
Your hanky?

381
00:18:53.741 --> 00:18:55.656
Oh. it's not mine.
It's actually my dad's.

382
00:18:55.786 --> 00:18:57.962
Your dad loaned you
his fucking snot-rag?

383
00:18:58.093 --> 00:18:59.225
Just temporarily.

384
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:02.924
Sorry. I'm not usually
like this.

385
00:19:03.054 --> 00:19:04.839
I-I-I just took a Benadryl.

386
00:19:04.969 --> 00:19:05.970
So...

387
00:19:09.017 --> 00:19:10.671
Why are you doing that?

388
00:19:10.801 --> 00:19:12.977
It's a free country. shit pig.

389
00:19:13.108 --> 00:19:15.545
Close your mouth. you look like
a fucking grass carp.

390
00:19:19.636 --> 00:19:21.638
God. I don't know why
Leah's so into you.

391
00:19:21.769 --> 00:19:23.988
She made it out
like you were a real catch.

392
00:19:24.119 --> 00:19:26.426
Oh. So you're. like.
Leah's cousin or something?

393
00:19:26.556 --> 00:19:27.818
Doi.

394
00:19:28.515 --> 00:19:30.691
And lucky me. she's only
35 miles south of Offutt.

395
00:19:30.821 --> 00:19:32.823
so this shithole gets
to be my reality all summer.

396
00:19:32.954 --> 00:19:34.303
Hmm.

397
00:19:34.434 --> 00:19:36.349
Hey. what's the suicide rate
in this hick town?

398
00:19:38.307 --> 00:19:39.395
Is that marijuana?

399
00:19:39.526 --> 00:19:40.788
What? Are you allergic?

400
00:19:43.269 --> 00:19:44.357
Oh. shit.

401
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:49.797
What is happening right now?

402
00:19:49.927 --> 00:19:51.929
I just. uh...

403
00:19:52.887 --> 00:19:53.931
It's dinner.

404
00:19:56.107 --> 00:19:57.065
I should go.

405
00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:58.501
I guess so.

406
00:19:58.632 --> 00:20:00.024
See you around. shit pig.

407
00:20:01.939 --> 00:20:03.680
Sooey!

408
00:20:10.687 --> 00:20:12.298
So. how's the job hunt
coming along?

409
00:20:12.428 --> 00:20:13.951
Mom. it's been like 48 hours.

410
00:20:14.082 --> 00:20:15.344
Watch the sass back.

411
00:20:15.475 --> 00:20:17.738
Mm. I got an auction
in two weeks.

412
00:20:17.868 --> 00:20:21.350
Ordered you a medium
with the new logo. just in case.

413
00:20:21.481 --> 00:20:22.873
It's polo style this year.

414
00:20:23.004 --> 00:20:25.006
- And salmon.
- Mm! Chrissy's idea.

415
00:20:25.136 --> 00:20:26.529
I designed them.

416
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.923
Have you thought
about mowing lawns?

417
00:20:29.053 --> 00:20:30.446
Now that's an idea.

418
00:20:30.577 --> 00:20:32.753
Are you kidding me?
This is me after one lawn.

419
00:20:32.883 --> 00:20:34.798
Oh. come on. nothing a little
Benadryl couldn't level out.

420
00:20:34.929 --> 00:20:36.235
- God bless you.
- Bless you.

421
00:20:36.365 --> 00:20:37.888
This is Benadryl.
I'm the fricking poster boy.

422
00:20:38.019 --> 00:20:39.281
- No fricks.
- No fricks.

423
00:20:39.412 --> 00:20:40.978
- Stuff it. Chrissy.
- You stuff it.

424
00:20:41.109 --> 00:20:43.242
- Stuff it big time.
- Zip it.

425
00:20:51.946 --> 00:20:55.297
Hey. Mom. there's a study group
tonight for the Civics final.

426
00:20:55.428 --> 00:20:56.777
Does it involve Moose?

427
00:20:56.907 --> 00:20:58.474
No. It's over at Beaumont's.

428
00:20:58.605 --> 00:21:01.347
- There's a fella with a plan.
- Such a go-getter.

429
00:21:01.477 --> 00:21:04.437
Maybe you could tag-team
with his mowing business.

430
00:21:04.567 --> 00:21:06.177
start some kind of lawn empire.

431
00:21:06.743 --> 00:21:10.834
No. I don't want to start a lawn
empire with Jason Beaumont.

432
00:21:10.965 --> 00:21:12.836
I just want to cram
for the Civics test.

433
00:21:12.967 --> 00:21:14.751
Watch the sass back.

434
00:21:15.317 --> 00:21:17.101
- Ten p.m.
- Ten?

435
00:21:17.232 --> 00:21:19.278
Mom. come on. it doesn't
even start until eight--

436
00:21:19.408 --> 00:21:21.192
Ten fifteen.
You're still grounded. buddy.

437
00:21:21.323 --> 00:21:23.151
Eleven.

438
00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:24.979
Here we go now.
Gonna let it go now.

439
00:21:25.109 --> 00:21:27.198
We're gonna start now at 10.
10. we'll bring it up to 10:15.

440
00:21:27.329 --> 00:21:29.200
- We're taking the 10:15.
- Hey!

441
00:21:29.331 --> 00:21:30.593
All the way up to 11.
we're looking at 11.

442
00:21:30.724 --> 00:21:32.291
Eleven's too high. Grounded.[Judge] Hey!

443
00:21:32.421 --> 00:21:34.336
Bring it all the way back.
now 10:30. now 10:15.

444
00:21:34.467 --> 00:21:37.644
10:15 it's gonna be.
and I'm giving you 10:15.

445
00:21:37.774 --> 00:21:39.080
- Sold now.
- Sold!

446
00:21:41.125 --> 00:21:43.432
<i>♪ I was clowning in class
like I usually do... ♪</i>

447
00:21:45.391 --> 00:21:47.436
Dude. I can't believe
we just dumped two cases.

448
00:21:47.567 --> 00:21:49.090
Two cases is pussy.

449
00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:50.874
Look at all these
college kids.

450
00:21:51.005 --> 00:21:52.659
We gotta partner up
with some frats.

451
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:54.791
Get our foot soldiers
in UNL. UNO.

452
00:21:54.922 --> 00:21:56.750
fucking Peru State.

453
00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.882
Dude. we could be offloading 400
gallons of Real Beer a month.

454
00:21:59.013 --> 00:22:00.057
Easy.

455
00:22:10.416 --> 00:22:12.374
Hey. watch where you're going. prep.

456
00:22:12.505 --> 00:22:14.768
- Sorry. dude.
- What did you just fucking say?

457
00:22:16.857 --> 00:22:18.162
We got a problem here?

458
00:22:18.293 --> 00:22:20.164
There is so not a problem.

459
00:22:20.295 --> 00:22:22.341
I didn't know
he was with you.

460
00:22:22.471 --> 00:22:24.255
Sorry. It won't happen again.

461
00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.000
Shane fucking Workman!

462
00:22:37.268 --> 00:22:39.358
Oh. Bravos.
Right over there.

463
00:22:39.488 --> 00:22:41.882
Okay. I've got this shit.
Hang back in the wings.

464
00:22:47.148 --> 00:22:48.541
Hey. what's up. boys?

465
00:22:48.671 --> 00:22:50.369
Who the fuck
are you assholes?

466
00:22:50.499 --> 00:22:53.502
Moose Miller.
This is my associate. A.J.

467
00:22:53.633 --> 00:22:55.286
We're the guys behind Real Beer.

468
00:22:55.417 --> 00:22:56.723
Real Beer?

469
00:22:56.853 --> 00:22:58.594
Yeah. that beer you're drinking.

470
00:22:58.725 --> 00:23:00.422
Wh-- You made this?

471
00:23:00.553 --> 00:23:01.945
Yeah. man.

472
00:23:02.076 --> 00:23:03.556
We're still finalizing
the design on the logo.

473
00:23:03.686 --> 00:23:06.472
but that next batch will look
as good as it tastes.

474
00:23:06.602 --> 00:23:08.125
How old are you guys?

475
00:23:08.256 --> 00:23:09.692
- Fourteen.
- Sixteen.

476
00:23:11.564 --> 00:23:13.261
Almost fifteen.

477
00:23:13.392 --> 00:23:15.045
Oh. yeah. I know this guy.

478
00:23:15.176 --> 00:23:17.091
You're the judge's kid.
aren't you?

479
00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:19.572
Yeah. he did our mom and dad's
divorce.

480
00:23:19.963 --> 00:23:21.356
Huh?

481
00:23:21.487 --> 00:23:24.054
I said your dad did
our mom and dad's divorce!

482
00:23:25.665 --> 00:23:27.971
So. uh. we heard you guys
are renting the Snack Shack

483
00:23:28.102 --> 00:23:29.625
out of the pool this summer.

484
00:23:29.756 --> 00:23:31.235
Yeah. So what?

485
00:23:31.366 --> 00:23:32.715
Well. Shane had mentioned

486
00:23:32.846 --> 00:23:34.935
that you guys might need
some extra hands.

487
00:23:35.065 --> 00:23:37.067
- Nah. we're cool.
- We can handle it ourselves.

488
00:23:37.198 --> 00:23:38.982
It's probably a real
gravy train. huh?

489
00:23:39.983 --> 00:23:41.158
We do all right.

490
00:23:41.289 --> 00:23:42.421
Mm-hmm.

491
00:23:43.726 --> 00:23:45.424
What's it cost to rent it out?

492
00:23:47.687 --> 00:23:49.950
Three grand my ass.
They're bluffing. big time.

493
00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.431
I don't know. dude.
A grand a month seems legit.

494
00:23:52.561 --> 00:23:55.912
Chump change compared to what
the fucker could turn over.

495
00:23:56.565 --> 00:24:00.003
Look. I say we go full tilt
on the Snack Shack.

496
00:24:03.659 --> 00:24:05.008
What's the pH at?

497
00:24:05.922 --> 00:24:07.707
It's a hair over 5.2.

498
00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.580
All right.
I should go.

499
00:24:11.711 --> 00:24:13.887
Jean'll kill me.
Fucker's definitely leaking.

500
00:24:14.017 --> 00:24:16.324
It's not. Look. dude.

501
00:24:16.455 --> 00:24:20.371
even if it took us all of June
to break even on the 3K.

502
00:24:20.502 --> 00:24:22.678
it'd still tee us up right
in the sweet spot of the summer.

503
00:24:22.809 --> 00:24:24.724
Fucking Fourth of July
to mid-August?

504
00:24:24.854 --> 00:24:26.726
That's like six weeks
of straight Profit Town.

505
00:24:26.856 --> 00:24:29.293
We can't cover three grand.
We're 1.600 bucks short.

506
00:24:29.424 --> 00:24:31.252
Yeah? So. look.

507
00:24:32.645 --> 00:24:34.211
I want to pitch you an idea.

508
00:24:34.777 --> 00:24:36.387
The whole kit and caboodle?

509
00:24:37.563 --> 00:24:39.173
Yeah. Yes... Yes. ma'am.

510
00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.829
Take off those glasses.

511
00:24:44.047 --> 00:24:45.396
Is there a problem here?

512
00:24:50.401 --> 00:24:52.055
- Goddamn.
- I can't believe I let you

513
00:24:52.186 --> 00:24:54.014
talk me into
this diaper shit. Moose.

514
00:24:54.144 --> 00:24:56.843
Like I had to twist your arm at
18 percent. you fucking shyster.

515
00:24:57.844 --> 00:24:59.628
Plus. you're the one
without a joint account. dude.

516
00:24:59.759 --> 00:25:02.109
- Why are we wearing suits?
- We look like power players

517
00:25:02.239 --> 00:25:04.154
that come in and cash out 2K
in a New York minute.

518
00:25:04.285 --> 00:25:06.983
Oh. my God.
She's talking to the manager.

519
00:25:09.203 --> 00:25:10.770
Dude. don't get your tits
in a ringer.

520
00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:12.728
I bet it's just protocol
for any withdrawal over a grand.

521
00:25:12.859 --> 00:25:14.338
No. that's Neil Bruning.

522
00:25:14.469 --> 00:25:16.166
He's in bridge club
with my parents and his wife.

523
00:25:16.297 --> 00:25:18.342
Bruning can't say shit. bitch.
It's not a joint account.

524
00:25:18.473 --> 00:25:20.388
A.J.

525
00:25:20.519 --> 00:25:23.434
Pretty chunky withdrawal for
a school day. don't you think?

526
00:25:25.741 --> 00:25:27.656
We're entrepreneurs.

527
00:25:27.787 --> 00:25:29.353
All right. last on the agenda:

528
00:25:29.484 --> 00:25:31.834
the concession stand
out at Steinhart Pool.

529
00:25:31.965 --> 00:25:33.793
Scooter. I understand
the bids are in?

530
00:25:33.923 --> 00:25:37.231
Uh. just a single. Mike.
From Chris and Jeff Bravo.

531
00:25:37.361 --> 00:25:38.667
To the tune of--

532
00:25:38.798 --> 00:25:40.408
- Hold on!
- Hey. wait! Stop.

533
00:25:41.627 --> 00:25:45.152
That is three thousand
and one...

534
00:25:47.197 --> 00:25:48.721
USD.

535
00:25:48.851 --> 00:25:50.766
Our bid for the concession stand
at the Steinhart Pool.

536
00:25:50.897 --> 00:25:51.811
In singles?

537
00:25:51.941 --> 00:25:53.290
Oh. it's a bit unorthodox.

538
00:25:53.421 --> 00:25:54.727
but the council
will consider all bids.

539
00:25:54.857 --> 00:25:55.989
proposed or otherwise.

540
00:25:56.119 --> 00:25:57.817
- Correct. Mr. Mayor?
- Aye.

541
00:25:58.426 --> 00:25:59.732
And the Bravos?

542
00:25:59.862 --> 00:26:01.560
It looks like a check for...

543
00:26:03.039 --> 00:26:04.258
$300.

544
00:26:07.261 --> 00:26:08.436
Well. boys.

545
00:26:09.089 --> 00:26:11.221
you've got yourself
a Snack Shack.

546
00:26:16.749 --> 00:26:19.447
<i>What the hell
were you two idiots thinking?</i>

547
00:26:19.578 --> 00:26:20.840
We have spent the last two hours

548
00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:21.971
- trying to track you down!
- Where is that money?

549
00:26:22.102 --> 00:26:24.017
Here. that's 400 right there.

550
00:26:24.147 --> 00:26:25.932
400?[Judge] Where's the rest?

551
00:26:26.062 --> 00:26:27.934
I've got Bruning telling me you
drained your savings account.

552
00:26:28.064 --> 00:26:29.675
This is tied
with the gambling. isn't it?

553
00:26:29.805 --> 00:26:31.677
No. Mrs. C--[both] Shut the frick up!

554
00:26:31.807 --> 00:26:33.722
We went down
to the city council meeting

555
00:26:33.853 --> 00:26:37.030
and we bid on the Snack Shack
at Steinhart Pool. and we won.

556
00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:40.381
You bid $2.000 on the Snack
Shack at the swimming pool?

557
00:26:40.511 --> 00:26:42.209
Actually. we bid three.

558
00:26:42.339 --> 00:26:44.298
And that money there
is for supplies and stuff.

559
00:26:44.428 --> 00:26:46.126
Supplies and stuff?

560
00:26:46.256 --> 00:26:48.345
Jean! Hand me that damn phone!

561
00:26:52.959 --> 00:26:54.264
Hello? Carters.

562
00:26:54.395 --> 00:26:56.005
Les?

563
00:26:56.136 --> 00:26:57.659
<i>I just found
a still in my basement.</i>

564
00:26:57.790 --> 00:26:59.879
<i>The boys are making alcohol.</i>

565
00:27:05.928 --> 00:27:08.627
I thought his waterbed
had popped. but it was hooch.

566
00:27:08.757 --> 00:27:10.716
Leaked out all the way
to the basement steps.

567
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:13.196
It's a science project.

568
00:27:13.327 --> 00:27:15.372
Oh. bullshit!

569
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:19.072
Five bucks says they were gonna
peddle this shit to kids.

570
00:27:19.202 --> 00:27:20.203
No.

571
00:27:20.334 --> 00:27:22.379
No. No!

572
00:27:28.995 --> 00:27:31.258
What is wrong with you?

573
00:27:41.877 --> 00:27:44.575
Hey. Dad? Can I say something?

574
00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:48.318
<i>And our lucky 16th caller</i>

575
00:27:48.449 --> 00:27:50.277
<i>will receive not one.</i>

576
00:27:50.407 --> 00:27:53.628
<i>but two tickets to see
Mannheim Steamroller live</i>

577
00:27:53.759 --> 00:27:55.630
<i>this September
at the Orpheum.</i>

578
00:27:55.761 --> 00:27:59.025
<i>Again. that's 187-3348</i>

579
00:27:59.155 --> 00:28:00.591
<i>for the studio line.</i>

580
00:28:00.722 --> 00:28:02.245
<i>Coming up at the top
of the hour.</i>

581
00:28:02.376 --> 00:28:05.466
<i>we've got the Ag Report.
followed by Party Line.</i>

582
00:28:09.949 --> 00:28:11.124
How could you?

583
00:28:11.254 --> 00:28:13.474
That money was for college.

584
00:28:14.344 --> 00:28:15.868
Or a car.

585
00:28:20.655 --> 00:28:22.048
Mom...

586
00:28:40.675 --> 00:28:41.545
Oh. man.

587
00:28:42.808 --> 00:28:44.287
This place is wrecked.

588
00:28:44.418 --> 00:28:46.725
It's a... It's a total shithole.

589
00:28:48.639 --> 00:28:49.597
Yeah.

590
00:28:51.338 --> 00:28:52.905
But it's our shithole.

591
00:29:08.834 --> 00:29:10.487
Fuck.

592
00:29:13.403 --> 00:29:14.491
Where's the fridge?

593
00:29:14.622 --> 00:29:16.102
How the fuck should I know?

594
00:29:16.929 --> 00:29:19.105
There's no fridge.
There's no microwave.

595
00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.369
That's a double punch
to the dick.

596
00:29:22.499 --> 00:29:25.676
Why is the floor
so fucking sticky? God!

597
00:29:25.807 --> 00:29:27.156
And I'm pretty sure
that's rat shit.

598
00:29:27.287 --> 00:29:29.115
All right. bitch.
Let's get to work.

599
00:29:29.245 --> 00:29:30.899
We need this fucker
spick-and-span

600
00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:32.945
in case some inspector comes
sniffing around. I'm serious.

601
00:29:33.075 --> 00:29:34.903
Wait. wait. what the fuck
are you gonna do. Moose?

602
00:29:36.992 --> 00:29:38.472
- Are you for real?
- Yeah.

603
00:29:38.602 --> 00:29:40.387
I gotta handle
all the upper management shit.

604
00:29:40.517 --> 00:29:42.868
- Upper management?
- Fucko. we're ten days out.

605
00:29:42.998 --> 00:29:44.652
We don't have a candy
distributor locked.

606
00:29:44.783 --> 00:29:47.133
No chips. No pop. No fridge.
No nuker. No fucking money.

607
00:29:47.263 --> 00:29:49.439
- What do you think I'm doing?
- We're absolutely fucked.

608
00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:51.006
No. we're not fucked.

609
00:29:51.137 --> 00:29:52.791
My parents are gonna send me
to military school.

610
00:29:52.921 --> 00:29:54.749
Calm the fuck down. No one's
going to military school.

611
00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.229
All right. look. have a smoke.

612
00:29:56.359 --> 00:29:57.404
Okay.

613
00:30:02.844 --> 00:30:05.586
New deal. We gotta resurrect
one of the old schemes.

614
00:30:05.716 --> 00:30:07.501
Make some quick cash
to float the first week.

615
00:30:07.631 --> 00:30:10.112
- You still holding any Utilac?
- I think I've got ten cans.

616
00:30:10.243 --> 00:30:12.419
- Then we run Curbs-n-Candy.
- With what candy. Moose?

617
00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:14.464
Those Boy Scout chocolates.
Those Turtles.

618
00:30:14.595 --> 00:30:16.989
- No. that shit's pre-Webelos.
- Who gives a shit?

619
00:30:17.119 --> 00:30:19.078
It's not like some old bird's
gonna check the expiration date.

620
00:30:19.208 --> 00:30:21.558
God.
You're subhuman.

621
00:30:21.689 --> 00:30:23.386
You know that. right?

622
00:30:24.039 --> 00:30:25.780
Oh. shit. dude.
I bet that's the Aksarben rep.

623
00:30:25.911 --> 00:30:28.217
I left the payphone number
with some chick at corporate.

624
00:30:28.348 --> 00:30:30.002
Just scrub the vermin shit. okay?

625
00:30:30.132 --> 00:30:31.351
I'll be back in a flash.

626
00:30:46.845 --> 00:30:48.498
Again. Mrs. Havercamp.

627
00:30:48.629 --> 00:30:52.024
we're talking a top-of-the-line.
aerosol-based Utilac 490.

628
00:30:52.154 --> 00:30:55.157
Aesthetically. it is
a stunning. high-gloss finish.

629
00:30:55.288 --> 00:30:57.464
- Who are you with again?
- SprayTech Industries. ma'am.

630
00:30:57.594 --> 00:30:59.945
We specialize in aerosol-based
paint solution.

631
00:31:00.075 --> 00:31:02.077
Wait. what is all this?

632
00:31:02.208 --> 00:31:06.125
Oh. we'll paint your address
on your street curb.

633
00:31:11.434 --> 00:31:13.175
No. I don't think so.

634
00:31:13.306 --> 00:31:17.614
Well. then might we offer you
a delicious four-pack

635
00:31:17.745 --> 00:31:20.487
of milk chocolate Turtles?

636
00:31:25.535 --> 00:31:27.146
Yo. here's the sitch.

637
00:31:28.756 --> 00:31:30.497
Homeboy's wanting to know
if we'd do two-fifty

638
00:31:30.627 --> 00:31:32.194
and all this for the paint job.

639
00:31:34.631 --> 00:31:36.807
- Is that a bucket of golf balls?
- Uh-huh.

640
00:31:36.938 --> 00:31:38.331
Come on. have some dignity.
Moose.

641
00:31:38.461 --> 00:31:39.810
No. dude. there are some
heavy hitters in here.

642
00:31:39.941 --> 00:31:41.334
Pings. Callaways.

643
00:31:41.464 --> 00:31:43.249
Fucking this dude's
clean as a whistle.

644
00:31:43.379 --> 00:31:45.033
Okay.

645
00:31:45.164 --> 00:31:47.209
I mean. I guess we could
go down to the golf course.

646
00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:49.124
gank a couple empty three-packs
from the dumpster

647
00:31:49.255 --> 00:31:50.865
behind the clubhouse.
dress them up like new.

648
00:31:50.996 --> 00:31:53.650
Dude. we can flip those bitches
for five bucks a pop.

649
00:31:54.564 --> 00:31:56.915
Yeah. okay. I'm in.

650
00:32:01.354 --> 00:32:02.703
Alrighty. Willy.

651
00:32:03.312 --> 00:32:04.531
Sold.

652
00:32:09.231 --> 00:32:11.103
That's insane.

653
00:32:11.233 --> 00:32:13.801
Yeah. true story.
Come on in.

654
00:32:13.932 --> 00:32:15.846
- Go on. take a seat.
- Yo. dude.

655
00:32:15.977 --> 00:32:17.109
Change okay?

656
00:32:17.239 --> 00:32:18.937
Oh. yeah.
Count it. dude.

657
00:32:19.067 --> 00:32:20.982
Uh. okay. I noticed

658
00:32:21.113 --> 00:32:22.331
all these <i>Wall Street Journals.</i>
Jesus Christ.

659
00:32:22.462 --> 00:32:24.203
Ah! You want to play the market. huh?

660
00:32:24.333 --> 00:32:26.553
- Yes. yes. Big time.
- Well...

661
00:32:28.207 --> 00:32:29.948
I've got two words for you.

662
00:32:32.515 --> 00:32:34.169
Tucson Electric.

663
00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:35.823
<i>Tucson Electric?</i>

664
00:32:35.954 --> 00:32:38.173
Come on. that geezer's brain
was totally pickled.

665
00:32:38.304 --> 00:32:39.870
I don't think so. dude.

666
00:32:40.001 --> 00:32:41.742
Willy's got the skinny.
You see all those WSJs?

667
00:32:41.872 --> 00:32:43.657
Yeah. I saw them.
Half of them were yellow.

668
00:32:43.787 --> 00:32:45.354
1985 yellow.

669
00:32:45.485 --> 00:32:47.269
Fucking porch smelled like
a men's shelter.

670
00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.445
He's throwing us a bone
'cause he digs our vibe. dude.

671
00:32:49.576 --> 00:32:52.492
I'm telling you. we should think
about dumping like half our ROI

672
00:32:52.622 --> 00:32:54.233
- into Tucson Electric.
- Moose!

673
00:32:54.363 --> 00:32:56.365
We're running a bunch of schemes
to pay for the fuck-ups

674
00:32:56.496 --> 00:32:57.888
on a job we haven't
even started yet.

675
00:32:58.019 --> 00:33:00.152
Just keep an open mind. bitch.
Damn.

676
00:33:11.641 --> 00:33:12.816
Hey.

677
00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.036
Shit pig.

678
00:33:17.734 --> 00:33:18.997
You're looking low.

679
00:33:19.954 --> 00:33:21.303
Maybe this'll jazz things up.

680
00:33:22.391 --> 00:33:23.914
What do you think?

681
00:33:26.221 --> 00:33:27.527
It's hideous.

682
00:33:27.788 --> 00:33:30.182
Oh. come on. It's solid gold.
Hold that sucker up.

683
00:33:33.794 --> 00:33:34.969
Wait...

684
00:33:35.883 --> 00:33:37.450
That's another keeper.

685
00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.756
It tells a story.
Like an evolution.

686
00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:44.239
An evolution?

687
00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:45.545
Yeah.

688
00:33:47.155 --> 00:33:48.156
Cool.

689
00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.508
So. what's your name?

690
00:33:53.161 --> 00:33:55.598
Whoa. shit pig.
Are you flirting with me?

691
00:33:57.209 --> 00:33:58.862
[Leah] Brooke?

692
00:33:58.993 --> 00:34:01.604
Yo.
- Gimme a ride to Chompy Cone?

693
00:34:01.735 --> 00:34:03.911
Oh. yeah. sure. Hop in the Jeep.
girl. Buckle up.

694
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:08.046
Hi. A.J.

695
00:34:08.829 --> 00:34:09.917
Hey.

696
00:34:11.875 --> 00:34:13.486
Summer jobs in Hicksville.

697
00:34:13.616 --> 00:34:15.488
Any ideas?

698
00:34:16.097 --> 00:34:18.491
I don't do polo shirts
or visors.

699
00:34:19.231 --> 00:34:21.668
I don't do polo shirts either.
so...

700
00:34:22.364 --> 00:34:24.105
Hmm. you are flirting with me.

701
00:34:26.455 --> 00:34:27.848
Oh. uh. can you swim?

702
00:34:30.807 --> 00:34:31.982
Yeah.

703
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:35.725
Smell that?

704
00:34:36.944 --> 00:34:38.511
On par with pussy.

705
00:34:39.816 --> 00:34:43.646
Hey. you ever. uh. had a couple
boxes fall off the truck?

706
00:34:44.473 --> 00:34:46.432
I don't know
what you're talking about.

707
00:34:46.562 --> 00:34:48.869
Look. is your mom or dad around?

708
00:34:48.999 --> 00:34:51.045
I need a Hancock
to square up on this invoice.

709
00:34:51.176 --> 00:34:53.395
Nah. man. me and homeboy here
are 50/50 on this bitch.

710
00:34:53.526 --> 00:34:55.571
I'm the one that set
everything up with Donna at HQ.

711
00:34:55.702 --> 00:34:57.225
- No shit.
- Mm-hmm.

712
00:34:57.356 --> 00:34:59.575
So check it.
so that's $350 right there.

713
00:34:59.706 --> 00:35:00.924
but don't sweat the change.

714
00:35:01.055 --> 00:35:03.101
Are you gonna be
our regular driver. Dean?

715
00:35:03.231 --> 00:35:05.233
Yup. Thursdays around 11
if you got an order in.

716
00:35:05.364 --> 00:35:07.279
All right. here's a little
something for you.

717
00:35:07.409 --> 00:35:09.281
- Seriously?
- Yeah. Let me see that blade.

718
00:35:16.288 --> 00:35:17.898
Hold on to this.

719
00:35:18.681 --> 00:35:20.944
Bring it back if some peanut
M&M's ever fall off the truck.

720
00:35:21.075 --> 00:35:22.120
You feel me?

721
00:35:28.822 --> 00:35:30.258
What the fuck are you doing?

722
00:35:31.129 --> 00:35:32.173
What do you mean?

723
00:35:33.479 --> 00:35:35.872
We're still short.
and you're bleeding out Grants

724
00:35:36.003 --> 00:35:38.310
to Dean the delivery guy?

725
00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:41.008
Yeah. but watch how it
boomerangs back. bitch. Tenfold.

726
00:35:41.139 --> 00:35:42.488
I don't want to watch it
boomerang back. Moose.

727
00:35:42.618 --> 00:35:44.185
I want to get out
of the fucking hole.

728
00:35:46.361 --> 00:35:47.667
Lip thing.

729
00:35:48.363 --> 00:35:51.366
Look. there's a poker game
tonight at Duff Warfield's.

730
00:35:51.497 --> 00:35:52.715
Fifty-dollar buy-ins.

731
00:35:52.846 --> 00:35:54.108
We sweep that shit.
we're in like Flynn.

732
00:35:54.239 --> 00:35:55.196
First week's covered.

733
00:35:56.154 --> 00:35:58.504
And if we lose?A.J.. these guys are farm team.

734
00:35:58.634 --> 00:36:01.724
We're talking sure shot.
Like taking candy from a baby.

735
00:36:02.377 --> 00:36:04.118
You haven't even said shit
about the fridge yet.

736
00:36:04.249 --> 00:36:06.425
- You're welcome.
- Yeah. it fucking reeks.

737
00:36:07.165 --> 00:36:08.688
- Where'd you get it?
- Fusselman's.

738
00:36:08.818 --> 00:36:10.255
Sucker's only five years old.

739
00:36:10.385 --> 00:36:12.300
Can you believe
they'd dump this baby?

740
00:36:12.779 --> 00:36:15.651
You got our fridge
from the funeral home?

741
00:36:15.782 --> 00:36:17.131
Yeah. Nuker too.

742
00:36:17.262 --> 00:36:18.524
Shit was a steal on Party Line.

743
00:36:18.654 --> 00:36:20.221
Plus. they fucking delivered.
dude...

744
00:36:20.352 --> 00:36:21.788
for a small fee.

745
00:36:21.918 --> 00:36:23.920
- Wait. what did you say?
- Look. just get her stocked.

746
00:36:24.051 --> 00:36:26.227
Okay? Anything chocolate
goes in the freezer.

747
00:36:26.358 --> 00:36:28.621
I gotta move on some hot dogs
back at the IGA.

748
00:36:28.751 --> 00:36:30.971
They practically give them away
when they're down to the wire.

749
00:36:31.101 --> 00:36:32.538
- Okay. I'll see you.

Those dance moves
are straight cringe.

763
00:37:25.808 --> 00:37:26.679
Hmm.

764
00:37:27.201 --> 00:37:28.724
So is this your little hovel?

765
00:37:31.684 --> 00:37:33.642
Come on. give me a hand.

766
00:37:43.609 --> 00:37:45.828
So...

767
00:37:46.829 --> 00:37:48.048
Talk to your boy yet?

768
00:37:50.529 --> 00:37:52.357
My... my boy?

769
00:37:54.141 --> 00:37:55.447
Yeah. about getting me a job?

770
00:37:55.577 --> 00:37:56.796
<i>All right.</i>

771
00:37:57.362 --> 00:37:59.015
Show me an armpit tow.

772
00:38:01.279 --> 00:38:02.497
On that skanky thing?

773
00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:11.985
Relax. shit pig.

774
00:38:12.115 --> 00:38:13.595
This doesn't mean
we're going steady.

775
00:38:14.292 --> 00:38:15.597
Can you stop
calling me that?

776
00:38:16.685 --> 00:38:17.817
Never.

777
00:38:21.647 --> 00:38:23.649
This doesn't feel like
your first rodeo.

778
00:38:25.041 --> 00:38:26.826
My daddy's an ex-PJ.

779
00:38:26.956 --> 00:38:29.263
So I spent the last two summers
fishing airmen out of the pool

780
00:38:29.394 --> 00:38:31.918
at Wright-Patterson.
just for shits and giggles.

781
00:38:32.614 --> 00:38:33.659
Holy shit.

782
00:38:34.486 --> 00:38:36.226
Well. I don't think I'm gonna
have to convince Ron.

783
00:38:36.966 --> 00:38:38.054
See you tomorrow.

784
00:38:38.968 --> 00:38:40.361
Roger. Wilco.

785
00:38:44.974 --> 00:38:46.454
For my scrapbook.

786
00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:48.238
All right.

787
00:38:49.239 --> 00:38:50.850
Walk me home. shit pig?

788
00:38:52.417 --> 00:38:54.332
I gotta get back to it.

789
00:38:54.462 --> 00:38:57.770
Still a lot of inventory
to sort. so...

790
00:39:00.033 --> 00:39:01.208
Got it.

791
00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:02.818
All right. See ya.

792
00:39:11.784 --> 00:39:13.089
Inventory to sort?

793
00:39:14.613 --> 00:39:15.918
That was just sad.

794
00:39:16.397 --> 00:39:18.181
I fucked up. didn't I?

795
00:39:18.747 --> 00:39:19.966
Yeah. Big time.

796
00:39:22.055 --> 00:39:23.448
Oh!

797
00:39:24.971 --> 00:39:27.582
<i>♪ Whoa. oh. oh. oh. oh ♪</i>

798
00:39:29.454 --> 00:39:32.544
Shane! Oh. it's so good
to see you!

799
00:39:32.674 --> 00:39:33.632
Mm!

800
00:39:33.762 --> 00:39:35.982
Huh. What is going on here. huh?

801
00:39:36.112 --> 00:39:38.898
Oh. where did
your little boy go?

802
00:39:39.768 --> 00:39:42.031
I'm so glad that you're home
safe and sound.

803
00:39:42.162 --> 00:39:45.208
- Must've been awful over there.
- Oh. it was a cakewalk. Mrs. C.

804
00:39:45.339 --> 00:39:47.776
Kuwait wasn't a cakewalk.
He's being modest.

805
00:39:47.907 --> 00:39:49.343
Two hundred and fifteen days

806
00:39:49.474 --> 00:39:51.824
of rear echelon.
non-potable water distro.

807
00:39:51.954 --> 00:39:54.130
Cakewalk City. BFE.

808
00:39:54.261 --> 00:39:57.133
BFE?Hey. Shane. Watch this.

809
00:39:58.613 --> 00:39:59.875
Pretty good.

810
00:40:00.702 --> 00:40:02.400
Hey. another beer. Judge?

811
00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:03.836
Well. all right.

812
00:40:07.927 --> 00:40:08.971
Wow.

813
00:40:10.146 --> 00:40:12.366
Oh. no. No. no. no.
I don't think so.

814
00:40:12.497 --> 00:40:14.586
- Absolutely not.
- Oh. come on.

815
00:40:14.716 --> 00:40:16.239
No one ever got worked up
when I was 15.

816
00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:17.937
He's 14.

817
00:40:18.067 --> 00:40:19.808
You know that him and Moose
have been making their own.

818
00:40:19.939 --> 00:40:21.636
I might've heard something
about that.

819
00:40:21.767 --> 00:40:23.682
I'm glad you're gonna be keeping
an eye on him at the pool.

820
00:40:23.812 --> 00:40:26.511
because he is one step away
from Nemaha Valley.

821
00:40:26.641 --> 00:40:28.643
Oh. come on.
That place is a torture chamber.

822
00:40:28.774 --> 00:40:30.297
He'd come out a robot.

823
00:40:30.428 --> 00:40:32.430
He could use a little bit
of that straight and narrow.

824
00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:34.344
You know. his father and I
are waiting to see

825
00:40:34.475 --> 00:40:36.172
if there's an open slot
this fall.

826
00:40:36.303 --> 00:40:37.739
Have you seen him
at the pool yet?

827
00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:39.654
At the Snack Shack?
He is busting his butt.

828
00:40:39.785 --> 00:40:41.221
He's totally dialed.
I'm telling you.

829
00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:43.919
- Hey there.
- Hey.

830
00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:46.269
Future BMOC.

831
00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:48.576
- What's all that business?
- Sigma Chi handshake.

832
00:40:48.707 --> 00:40:51.405
A little birdie said
someone's pledging.

833
00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.887
Yeah. I guess that's the plan.

834
00:40:55.017 --> 00:40:57.193
Ooh! That's a solid plan.

835
00:40:57.324 --> 00:41:00.370
But the little birdie
did not mention a major.

836
00:41:00.501 --> 00:41:03.852
I'm thinking maybe Poly Sci.
Econ. Who knows?

837
00:41:03.983 --> 00:41:07.247
Well. just don't bury your nose
too deep in those books.

838
00:41:07.377 --> 00:41:10.598
There's a lot of
extracurriculars at the house.

839
00:41:10.729 --> 00:41:11.860
you feel me?

840
00:41:11.991 --> 00:41:14.254
Yeah.

841
00:41:15.168 --> 00:41:17.387
- Law school?
- Oh. still on my mind. Judge.

842
00:41:17.518 --> 00:41:19.825
- Still on my mind.
- Good answer.

843
00:41:19.955 --> 00:41:21.696
He's got an eye
on Northwestern.

844
00:41:21.827 --> 00:41:24.046
Now. if you need a letter
of recommendation. anything.

845
00:41:24.177 --> 00:41:25.831
you let me know.

846
00:41:28.181 --> 00:41:29.356
Taking notes?

847
00:41:29.487 --> 00:41:30.575
On what?

848
00:41:30.705 --> 00:41:31.967
Everything.

851
00:41:40.976 --> 00:41:43.892
You and Moose are OG as fuck.
They just don't know it yet.

852
00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:50.159
Hey. at least your life
isn't mapped out to a T

853
00:41:50.290 --> 00:41:51.596
for the next six years.

854
00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:55.643
You really pledging
Sigma Chi?

855
00:41:55.774 --> 00:41:56.775
Fuck no.

856
00:42:03.825 --> 00:42:05.261
What's all this?

857
00:42:05.392 --> 00:42:08.613
Oh. Asymmetric warfare.

858
00:42:09.614 --> 00:42:11.529
Alaska. Next summer.

859
00:42:12.791 --> 00:42:13.835
You want in?

860
00:42:13.966 --> 00:42:15.620
I was planning on flying solo.

There you go.

1169
01:02:35.316 --> 01:02:37.275
That was fucking epic. dude.

1170
01:02:38.667 --> 01:02:41.105
Shane was right. man.
Those guys are soft as fuck.

1171
01:02:42.019 --> 01:02:43.150
All right.

1172
01:02:43.716 --> 01:02:45.326
This'll cover supplies.

1173
01:02:45.457 --> 01:02:47.633
This is me.
This is you.

01:02:48.895 --> 01:02:49.896
Fucking A.

1175
01:02:50.027 --> 01:02:51.245
Look at all this scratch.

1176
01:02:51.376 --> 01:02:53.204
Fifteen hundos right there.

1177
01:02:53.334 --> 01:02:55.902
But we better find a way
to hide some of this shit

1178
01:02:56.033 --> 01:02:57.686
if we want to fuck around
this fall.

1179
01:02:57.817 --> 01:02:59.340
The Judge and Jean don't have
any idea what we're pulling in.

1180
01:02:59.471 --> 01:03:00.777
- Do they?
- Hell no.

1181
01:03:00.907 --> 01:03:02.082
They think this whole thing's
a shit show.

1182
01:03:02.213 --> 01:03:04.432
Look. dude. I want
to pitch you an idea.

1183
01:03:05.042 --> 01:03:06.826
You can't pass. dude.
We're best friends.

1184
01:03:06.957 --> 01:03:09.437
- We go 50/50 on every deal.
- Moose. no.

1185
01:03:09.568 --> 01:03:11.483
It's a big-time pass.
I'm telling you.

1186
01:03:12.397 --> 01:03:14.181
- I'm saving up for Alaska.
- Alaska?

1187
01:03:14.312 --> 01:03:15.835
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1188
01:03:15.966 --> 01:03:17.750
Next summer.
It's a five-week trek.

1189
01:03:17.881 --> 01:03:19.796
Shane and I got the entire thing
mapped out.

1190
01:03:22.407 --> 01:03:24.148
You didn't clear that with me.

1191
01:03:24.757 --> 01:03:26.324
I don't need
to clear that with you.

1192
01:03:29.153 --> 01:03:31.895
Look. dude. all I'm asking for
is five minutes. okay?

1193
01:03:32.025 --> 01:03:34.201
Just hear what Willy has to say.
This thing's a sure shot.

1194
01:03:34.332 --> 01:03:35.681
We could triple
what we stick in...

1195
01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:37.596
Oh. shit--

1196
01:03:39.206 --> 01:03:40.294
That's what you get.
you fucking preps.

1197
01:03:40.425 --> 01:03:41.295
Why?

1198
01:03:43.036 --> 01:03:44.864
- That's for the hot dog.
- And this is for my Trans Am.

1199
01:03:45.909 --> 01:03:47.562
And here's a couple
for your fucking friend.

1200
01:03:57.224 --> 01:03:59.270
I still say they're soft
as fuck. dude.

1201
01:04:01.576 --> 01:04:03.404
What a couple of clits.

1202
01:04:04.144 --> 01:04:06.886
Moose. half your face
is nothing but blood.

1203
01:04:09.889 --> 01:04:10.934
Yeah. I know.

1204
01:04:12.283 --> 01:04:14.502
But we could take them
in a fair fight. dude.

1205
01:04:15.373 --> 01:04:17.114
I'm fucking serious.

1206
01:04:18.245 --> 01:04:19.899
They got lucky
with that ambush.

1207
01:04:23.555 --> 01:04:25.383
Tucson Electric. You coming?

1208
01:04:25.513 --> 01:04:26.993
It's your scene.

1209
01:04:29.735 --> 01:04:30.867
I'll stew on it.

1210
01:04:35.784 --> 01:04:38.048
All right. well. don't show
your parents the knot.

1211
01:04:39.397 --> 01:04:40.528
Yeah.

1212
01:04:51.496 --> 01:04:54.064
Hey. shit pig.
You paint?

1213
01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:56.240
What? Curbs?

1214
01:04:56.370 --> 01:04:57.545
Curbs?

1215
01:04:58.503 --> 01:05:00.244
No. bitch. Toes.

1216
01:05:09.383 --> 01:05:10.994
You're not very good at this.

1217
01:05:11.995 --> 01:05:14.171
That's because I'm used
to a Utilac spray.

1218
01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:16.564
Not this tiny little brush.

1219
01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:23.876
You okay?

1220
01:05:24.007 --> 01:05:25.312
You look a little wrecked.

1221
01:05:26.139 --> 01:05:27.532
Yeah. I'm all right.

1222
01:05:30.839 --> 01:05:33.842
So how come you've been flying
under the radar these days?

1223
01:05:37.542 --> 01:05:40.023
Guess I've just been busy
with work.

1224
01:05:44.766 --> 01:05:46.029
Busy. huh?

1225
01:05:47.247 --> 01:05:48.335
Mm-hmm.

1226
01:05:53.601 --> 01:05:54.994
Moose talk about me?

1227
01:05:58.998 --> 01:06:00.391
To me?

1228
01:06:01.261 --> 01:06:03.133
No. Not really.

1229
01:06:08.355 --> 01:06:10.531
I'm sure there are
a few embellishments.

1230
01:06:15.884 --> 01:06:17.060
Moose is fun.

1231
01:06:18.539 --> 01:06:19.671
Pretty good kisser.

1232
01:06:23.849 --> 01:06:25.851
But he's not really my type.

1233
01:06:25.982 --> 01:06:27.026
You know?

1234
01:06:29.681 --> 01:06:31.988
Sometimes it sucks
being a short-timer.

1235
01:06:34.425 --> 01:06:37.167
Soon as you make friends.
it's taillights.

1236
01:06:39.865 --> 01:06:43.129
I just want to have fun
this summer. you feel me?

1237
01:06:49.266 --> 01:06:50.702
Pass me that Minolta.

1238
01:07:15.335 --> 01:07:16.336
Now what?

1239
01:07:21.776 --> 01:07:22.864
Cotton balls. shit pig.

1240
01:07:30.524 --> 01:07:33.049
Who saved room
for banana cream pie?

1241
01:07:33.962 --> 01:07:35.399
I call the big piece.

1242
01:07:35.529 --> 01:07:37.749
Chrissy made
Dance Squad captain.

1243
01:07:43.363 --> 01:07:45.104
I have an announcement.

1244
01:07:46.932 --> 01:07:48.847
- An announcement?
- Mm-hmm.

1245
01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:57.073
That's 3.100.

1246
01:07:57.203 --> 01:08:00.119
That's the 16 that I owe.
plus another 15.

1247
01:08:02.730 --> 01:08:04.080
Give him the big piece.

1248
01:08:06.821 --> 01:08:08.084
Dad!

1249
01:08:08.214 --> 01:08:10.216
- Zip it. Chrissy.
- Also...

1250
01:08:11.826 --> 01:08:13.524
This is for you and Mom.

1251
01:08:24.187 --> 01:08:25.101
What is it?

1252
01:08:26.406 --> 01:08:28.452
Mannheim Steamroller
at the Orpheum.

1253
01:08:35.633 --> 01:08:37.417
Are you fricking kidding me?

1254
01:08:37.548 --> 01:08:39.506
Center aisle.
The third row.

1255
01:08:40.594 --> 01:08:41.856
Oh!

1256
01:08:45.599 --> 01:08:47.819
<i>Goddamn it.
You're such a fucking puss.</i>

1257
01:08:47.949 --> 01:08:49.516
<i>I knew you were gonna
show your parents that knot.</i>

1258
01:08:49.647 --> 01:08:52.302
<i>What a waste. So. what are we
getting into tonight?</i>

1259
01:08:52.432 --> 01:08:54.217
Huh?
<i>It's Friday night.</i>

1260
01:08:54.347 --> 01:08:56.001
<i>Let's get sloppy.
Go walk Main.</i>

1261
01:08:56.132 --> 01:08:57.916
No. I'm not really
feeling it. dude.

1262
01:08:58.046 --> 01:09:00.136
<i>Not feeling it?
What are you. ragging?</i>

1263
01:09:00.266 --> 01:09:03.008
No. I'm dog-assed tired. Moose.
I just want to sleep.

1264
01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:05.880
<i>Oh. come on.
Don't be such a fucking pussy.</i>

1265
01:09:12.452 --> 01:09:14.324
What?
<i>Now you're hanging up?</i>

1266
01:09:14.454 --> 01:09:17.283
<i>Hello? Carters.</i>
<i>Hi. Mrs. C. It's Moose.</i>

1267
01:09:18.502 --> 01:09:19.372
Jesus.

1268
01:09:20.895 --> 01:09:23.507
<i>Ma'am? Yes. ma'am.</i>

1269
01:09:23.637 --> 01:09:25.465
<i>That there your husband
downstairs...?</i>

1270
01:09:32.516 --> 01:09:34.170
<i>Oh. Jesus!</i>

1271
01:09:54.973 --> 01:09:57.236
Hey. shit pig. You awake?

1272
01:10:45.415 --> 01:10:47.199
- What?
- Nothing.

1273
01:11:02.997 --> 01:11:04.216
What are you doing?

1274
01:11:05.478 --> 01:11:06.653
What are you doing?

1275
01:11:10.222 --> 01:11:12.703
Yo. perverts! Get in.

1276
01:11:12.833 --> 01:11:15.140

Oh. shit.[A.J.] Fuck!

1298
01:13:26.184 --> 01:13:27.620
Yo. Brooke. over here.
This way. Come here.

1299
01:13:27.751 --> 01:13:29.753
Moose. let's go.
Up here. come on. guys.

1300
01:13:32.103 --> 01:13:33.713
Come on.

1301
01:13:34.627 --> 01:13:36.455
Go. go. go. go. go!

1302
01:13:37.021 --> 01:13:38.414
Shit.

1303

Guys. behind the screen.
Behind the screen. Come here.

1304
01:13:41.547 --> 01:13:42.722
Oh. fuck.

1305
01:13:44.768 --> 01:13:46.291
I don't do tight spaces.

1306
01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:48.946
Shut up.
We're about to get popped.

1307
01:13:49.076 --> 01:13:50.556
You don't understand.
I can't fucking breathe.

1308
01:13:50.687 --> 01:13:52.123
Both of you.
shut the fuck up.

1309
01:13:52.993 --> 01:13:54.168
Shh! Check it.

1310
01:13:58.782 --> 01:14:00.174
I can't fucking do this...

1311
01:14:00.305 --> 01:14:01.959
- Moose. shut up.
- I'm gonna freak.

1312
01:14:02.089 --> 01:14:03.482
Stop fucking talking.[officer] Hey.

1313
01:14:04.657 --> 01:14:07.660
You don't think someone could
hide back behind that shit?

1314
01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:10.054
Oh... oh. fuck.

1315
01:14:10.794 --> 01:14:11.795
Shh!

1316
01:14:12.056 --> 01:14:14.406
Fuck. fuck. fuck. fuck. fuck.

1317
01:14:25.983 --> 01:14:27.332
Here you go. kid.

1318
01:14:31.379 --> 01:14:32.685
What are you looking at?

1319
01:14:33.686 --> 01:14:34.513
Nothing.

1320
01:14:35.253 --> 01:14:36.472
What are you looking at?

1321
01:14:38.212 --> 01:14:39.692
Nothing.

1322
01:14:39.823 --> 01:14:41.389
This some kind of lover's spat?

1323
01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:44.044
- What do you want. dude?
- Top me off with DC.

1324
01:14:44.175 --> 01:14:47.526
Hey. go heavy on the ice. okay?
I'm fucking melting out here.

1325
01:14:54.925 --> 01:14:56.013
Here.

1326
01:15:08.634 --> 01:15:10.375
Give the deck a wet-down.
It's almost safety check.

1327
01:15:10.506 --> 01:15:11.942
No. hey.

1328
01:15:12.072 --> 01:15:14.466
You're not my fucking boss. okay?

1329
01:15:15.032 --> 01:15:16.468
You do it.

1330
01:15:16.990 --> 01:15:18.949
Just get one of the goobs
to spray her down. you idiot.

1331
01:15:19.079 --> 01:15:20.124
I don't care.

1332
01:15:27.653 --> 01:15:29.089
You going to. uh.
the party tonight?

1333
01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:31.439
- What party?
- Brooke's party.

1334
01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:34.355
It's like 15 yards
from your front door. Eagle.

1335
01:15:34.486 --> 01:15:35.356
What is that shit?

1336
01:15:37.489 --> 01:15:38.751
Don't worry about it.

1337
01:15:39.839 --> 01:15:41.145
A jewelry box
from Martin's?

1338
01:15:41.275 --> 01:15:42.668
Really?

1339
01:15:47.238 --> 01:15:50.633
Look. dude. I know you think
you're tight with homegirl.

1340
01:15:50.763 --> 01:15:53.461
but she gave me a handjob
behind that screen last night.

1341
01:15:54.375 --> 01:15:55.681
What?[Moose] Yeah.

1342
01:15:56.421 --> 01:15:58.162
- Dude. there's no fucking way.
- Whatever. dude.

1343
01:15:58.292 --> 01:15:59.729
She totally jerked me off.

1344
01:15:59.859 --> 01:16:01.774
Fucking grade A too.

1345
01:16:01.905 --> 01:16:03.733
Honestly. I don't know how
you didn't hear it. man.

1346
01:16:03.863 --> 01:16:06.257
You were right there.[Brooke] Yo. Moose.

1347
01:16:06.953 --> 01:16:08.389
Bring me a DP.

1348
01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:09.782
I got you.

1349
01:16:16.223 --> 01:16:18.399
One large Dr Pepper. please.

1350
01:16:19.966 --> 01:16:20.880
Yeah.

1351
01:16:27.017 --> 01:16:28.627
Lip thing.

1352
01:16:34.198 --> 01:16:36.113
Mister. you got a Nut Roll?

1353
01:16:37.331 --> 01:16:39.029
Fuck off. kid.

1354
01:16:48.691 --> 01:16:50.301
- For you.
- Oh. my God!

1355
01:16:50.431 --> 01:16:52.085
What do you think?

1356
01:16:52.216 --> 01:16:54.131
I love it.
- Are you kidding with this shit?

1357
01:16:54.261 --> 01:16:55.741
- My son is five.
- Calm down. lady.

1358
01:16:55.872 --> 01:16:57.177
I'm not gonna calm down.

1359
01:16:57.351 --> 01:16:58.962
I demand to speak
with your manager.

1360
01:16:59.092 --> 01:17:00.572
I am the manager.

1361
01:17:01.486 --> 01:17:03.096
- Bullshit.
- You're bullshit.

1362
01:17:03.227 --> 01:17:04.794
Your fucking kid's bullshit too.

1363
01:17:04.924 --> 01:17:06.709
and you're both
making me nauseous.

1364
01:17:06.839 --> 01:17:08.928
Mommy. can I lick
the ketchup off the bun?

1365
01:17:15.239 --> 01:17:16.501
What the fuck?

1366
01:17:17.197 --> 01:17:18.590
Hey. hang tight. lady.

1367
01:17:18.721 --> 01:17:20.984
I'm gonna comp your boy's meal
a hundred percent.

1368
01:17:23.290 --> 01:17:24.770
Hey. shit pig. You okay?

1369
01:17:24.901 --> 01:17:26.859
Yeah. I'm good.[Moose] It's three o'clock.

1370
01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:28.426
Where the fuck are you going?

1371
01:17:28.556 --> 01:17:29.732
Just giving you space

1372
01:17:29.862 --> 01:17:31.429
for all your fucking handjobs!

1373
01:18:03.591 --> 01:18:04.767
Get in.

1374
01:18:36.581 --> 01:18:38.017
How's that runza?

1375
01:18:39.497 --> 01:18:41.194
All right. I guess.

1376
01:18:42.761 --> 01:18:44.197
Want some rings?

1377
01:18:44.328 --> 01:18:46.809
No. I want Moose to quit
rat-fucking me all the time.

1378
01:18:46.939 --> 01:18:49.507
When he's not busy shot calling.
he's swooping on my lady friend.

1379
01:18:54.555 --> 01:18:56.166
You want a little advice. homey?

1380
01:18:56.296 --> 01:18:57.471
What?

1381
01:18:58.298 --> 01:18:59.343
Make a move.

1382
01:19:00.561 --> 01:19:01.867
Any move.

1383
01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:05.262
Brooke isn't into Moose.

1384
01:19:05.392 --> 01:19:07.873
She's just waiting for you
to make a move. telling you.

1385
01:19:10.528 --> 01:19:12.530
You ever make a move?

1386
01:19:16.447 --> 01:19:17.665
Like on a lady friend?

1387
01:19:18.928 --> 01:19:19.842
Yeah.

1388
01:19:24.063 --> 01:19:24.977
Almost.

1389
01:19:31.810 --> 01:19:33.769
You gotta risk it
for the biscuit. Eagle.

That was all in his head.
shit pig.

1408
01:21:26.359 --> 01:21:28.318
I grabbed both your dicks
because it was the only way

1409
01:21:28.448 --> 01:21:30.059
I could get you two pussies
to shut up.

Moose! Come on!

1421
01:22:19.456 --> 01:22:21.023
Come on. let's talk!

1422
01:22:35.907 --> 01:22:37.953
Moose! Come on. dude.

1423
01:22:39.606 --> 01:22:40.651
Come on.

1424
01:22:40.781 --> 01:22:42.044
Let's just fucking talk.

1425
01:22:47.397 --> 01:22:49.486
Get the fuck away from me.

1426
01:23:36.794 --> 01:23:38.665
I just got off the phone
with Parks & Rec.

1427
01:23:38.796 --> 01:23:40.624
No one's manning
the Snack Shack.

1428
01:23:40.754 --> 01:23:41.755
Are you going in?

1429
01:23:42.365 --> 01:23:43.627
I'm sick.

1430
01:23:43.757 --> 01:23:45.281
Well. what about Moose?

1431
01:25:06.710 --> 01:25:07.754
Hey.

1432
01:25:15.936 --> 01:25:17.764
Dude. what the fuck happened?

1433
01:25:18.722 --> 01:25:20.115
Take a wild guess.

1434
01:25:28.514 --> 01:25:29.907
Here.

1435
01:25:30.037 --> 01:25:32.649
You good with Tuesdays.
Wednesdays. and Saturdays?

1436
01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:35.913
- What. like shifts?
- Yeah.

1437
01:25:36.043 --> 01:25:37.436
We'll divvy up Sundays.
I'll get this one.

1438
01:25:37.567 --> 01:25:39.221
- You get the next.
- Moose!

1439
01:25:42.093 --> 01:25:43.268
Fuck.

1440
01:25:44.617 --> 01:25:46.271
Can I get a jumbo Push Pop?

1441
01:25:46.402 --> 01:25:47.620
Yeah.

1442
01:25:55.411 --> 01:25:57.021
Hey. shit pig.

1443
01:25:58.022 --> 01:26:00.024
How come you pulled
a Copperfield at the party?

1444
01:26:00.155 --> 01:26:01.286
I waited for you all night.

1445
01:26:05.638 --> 01:26:07.162
So you want to ditch
this pop stand

1446
01:26:07.292 --> 01:26:09.251
and go grab a twist
from Chompy Cone?

1447
01:26:09.381 --> 01:26:11.688
- My treat.
- No. thanks.

1448
01:26:11.818 --> 01:26:14.256
Come on. no one says no
to free ice cream.

1449
01:26:14.952 --> 01:26:16.171
Want to hear it again?

1450
01:26:16.301 --> 01:26:17.694
Wait. are you being serious
right now?

1451
01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:28.139
It's feeling like a negatory on
the biscuit front there. Eagle.

1452
01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:42.806
- Where are you going?
- Waubonsie.

1453
01:26:43.589 --> 01:26:45.983
Gonna polish off this case.
sleep under the stars.

1454
01:26:46.113 --> 01:26:48.290
I can't go to Iowa. I'm not
supposed to cross state lines.

1455
01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:49.595
Gonna call your mom
at the next truck stop.

1456
01:26:49.726 --> 01:26:51.162
tell her you're staying
with Moose.

1457
01:26:51.293 --> 01:26:53.991
- What are you doing?
- Not stopping till you say yes.

1458
01:26:54.121 --> 01:26:55.645
Come on. Shane.
Slow down. dude. Oh. shit!

1459
01:26:57.821 --> 01:26:59.344
Fuck! All right! I'm in. I'm in!

1460
01:26:59.475 --> 01:27:00.780
- All right! There we go.
- God!

1461
01:27:00.911 --> 01:27:02.739
You've been busting your ass
all summer.

1462
01:27:02.869 --> 01:27:04.219
It's time to fucking unwind.

1463
01:27:21.192 --> 01:27:22.498
Heads up. Eagle.

1464
01:27:46.435 --> 01:27:48.263
Yo. what happened
with you and Brooke?

1465
01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:51.396
You gonna spill or what?

1466
01:27:56.271 --> 01:27:57.576
She lied to me.

1467
01:27:57.707 --> 01:27:59.491
She lied to you?

1468
01:27:59.622 --> 01:28:00.666
Yeah.

1469
01:28:05.715 --> 01:28:07.194
I caught her red-handed.

1470
01:28:10.067 --> 01:28:11.590
Doesn't sound like homegirl.

1471
01:28:14.289 --> 01:28:17.553
She said that she waited for me
all night at the party.

1472
01:28:19.555 --> 01:28:22.558
And then I caught her hanging
on some fucking giant

1473
01:28:22.688 --> 01:28:23.863
out on the porch.

1474
01:28:28.259 --> 01:28:29.434
Flattop?

1475
01:28:30.348 --> 01:28:31.436
Yeah.

1476
01:28:31.567 --> 01:28:33.917
- Green Duster?
- Exactly.

1477
01:28:40.010 --> 01:28:41.446
What?

1478
01:28:43.318 --> 01:28:45.276
Oh. dude.

1479
01:28:45.407 --> 01:28:46.843
The jarhead's her brother.

1480
01:28:50.586 --> 01:28:51.543
Fuck.

1481
01:28:56.896 --> 01:28:57.854
Fuck!

1482
01:29:00.639 --> 01:29:02.728
Oh. fucking A. Eagle.

1483
01:29:07.429 --> 01:29:08.343
Just let me explain.

1484
01:29:08.473 --> 01:29:09.822
- Come on.
- No. thanks.

1485
01:29:09.953 --> 01:29:11.781
Brooke. come on.
Look. I didn't realize.

1486
01:29:11.911 --> 01:29:13.435
I know I fucked up.
Just please just listen--

1487
01:29:13.565 --> 01:29:14.958
No. thanks.

1488
01:29:16.394 --> 01:29:17.613
Want to hear it again?

1489
01:29:24.359 --> 01:29:26.012
Oh. can we get
some of this. Mom?

1490
01:29:26.143 --> 01:29:28.363
Sure. Just one.

1491
01:29:34.369 --> 01:29:35.892
What's up. A-Jams?

1492
01:29:36.022 --> 01:29:37.372
Hey. Shan.

1493
01:29:39.722 --> 01:29:40.984
Stop.

1494
01:29:41.114 --> 01:29:42.464
Isn't she a sophomore?

1495
01:29:42.594 --> 01:29:43.595
Junior.

1496
01:29:44.901 --> 01:29:46.555
So how did you
get to know her?

1497
01:29:46.685 --> 01:29:48.034
That's Donny's older sister.

1498
01:29:48.165 --> 01:29:49.688
Well. I would think
that you would--

1499
01:29:50.385 --> 01:29:52.778
Oh. my God. Jeanie!

1500
01:29:52.909 --> 01:29:54.693
You scared the heck out of me.

1501
01:29:54.824 --> 01:29:56.652
Sherry! How are you doing?

1502
01:29:56.782 --> 01:29:59.132
Oh. my God.
It's been forever. right?

1503
01:29:59.263 --> 01:30:00.525
It has.

1504
01:30:00.656 --> 01:30:02.745
I'm used to seeing
that big turkey.

1505
01:30:03.963 --> 01:30:05.704
Oh! Your hair.

1506
01:30:05.835 --> 01:30:07.489
I know.

1507
01:30:07.619 --> 01:30:09.360
It was time for a change.

1508
01:30:09.491 --> 01:30:10.927
Oh. it's so full.

1509
01:30:11.057 --> 01:30:12.624
Almost like a Kay Orr thing.

1510
01:30:12.755 --> 01:30:14.496
- I love it.
- Aw!

1511
01:30:14.626 --> 01:30:16.062
Thank you.

1512
01:30:17.542 --> 01:30:18.891
What's going on?

1513
01:30:19.979 --> 01:30:22.547
You guys get in a tiff at your
sleepover the other night?

1514
01:30:23.113 --> 01:30:24.419
What sleepover?

1515
01:30:28.292 --> 01:30:29.424
- Really?
- I don't know.

1516
01:31:00.977 --> 01:31:03.196
Happy early birthday. asshole.

1517
01:31:04.546 --> 01:31:06.373
Got you a little
something-something.

1518
01:31:08.158 --> 01:31:09.420
You want to lunch it
at Babe's?

1519
01:31:09.551 --> 01:31:10.900
How about a rain check?

1520
01:31:13.293 --> 01:31:14.947
I still gotta do
the whole backyard.

1521
01:31:24.217 --> 01:31:25.392
How's the weather over there?

1522
01:31:26.568 --> 01:31:28.744
Cloudy with a chance
of diaper shit.

1523
01:31:29.832 --> 01:31:33.488
Well. hang in there.
Eagle Scout.

1524
01:31:35.228 --> 01:31:36.534
I'll swing by later.

1525
01:31:37.274 --> 01:31:38.536
See if you want to get stupid.

1526
01:31:38.667 --> 01:31:40.407
Word. Thanks. homey.

1527
01:32:11.874 --> 01:32:13.092
Peace offering. shit pig.

1528
01:32:14.050 --> 01:32:15.573
For your box stall.

1529
01:32:16.226 --> 01:32:17.619
- Wow.
- I know.

1530
01:32:18.097 --> 01:32:19.925
It's probably
the only portrait of myself

1531
01:32:20.056 --> 01:32:21.187
I can actually stomach.

1532
01:32:25.061 --> 01:32:26.192
So...

1533
01:32:26.323 --> 01:32:27.846
Is anyone up
in this bitch?

1534
01:32:27.977 --> 01:32:29.369
Uh. no.

1535
01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:32.503
Sooey!

1536
01:32:35.462 --> 01:32:36.986
You ever make out
to <i>Combat Shock?</i>

1537
01:32:38.161 --> 01:32:39.597
<i>Right at that moment.</i>

1538
01:32:39.728 --> 01:32:41.120
<i>I knew what had to be done.</i>

1539
01:32:41.904 --> 01:32:43.732
<i>It was all coming back to me.</i>

1540
01:32:44.689 --> 01:32:46.952
<i>A revelation
that hit me like a bullet.</i>

1541
01:32:48.563 --> 01:32:51.653
<i>Bullets.
This chick was armed.</i>

1542
01:32:51.783 --> 01:32:55.221
<i>I felt a tremendous power
surging through my veins.</i>

1543
01:32:55.352 --> 01:32:56.875
<i>Where's the gun?</i>

1544
01:33:10.367 --> 01:33:11.934
I gotta tell you something.

1545
01:33:12.064 --> 01:33:14.980
So. no grass carping. okay?

1546
01:33:17.330 --> 01:33:18.984
Yeah. What?

1547
01:33:21.508 --> 01:33:22.858
My dad got his orders.

1548
01:33:24.555 --> 01:33:26.165
We're shipping out to Ramstein.

1549
01:33:29.865 --> 01:33:30.953
Ramstein?

1550
01:33:32.519 --> 01:33:33.564
Germany.

1551
01:33:37.263 --> 01:33:38.264
When?

1552
01:33:39.352 --> 01:33:40.484
Next week.

1553
01:33:45.184 --> 01:33:46.533
Next week? I...

1554
01:33:47.839 --> 01:33:49.232
You're grass carping.

1555
01:33:57.109 --> 01:33:58.676
I got a question.

1556
01:33:59.851 --> 01:34:00.896
Yeah?

1557
01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:05.814
Do you have a condom?

1558
01:34:26.138 --> 01:34:28.010
Oh. shit.
that's the Judge.

1559
01:34:28.140 --> 01:34:29.446
Awkward.

1560
01:34:29.576 --> 01:34:31.317
Maybe he's just
grabbing something.

1561
01:34:31.448 --> 01:34:32.841
Shh.

1562
01:34:34.190 --> 01:34:36.105
A.J.?Hey. Dad. don't come in here!

1563
01:34:43.721 --> 01:34:45.288
Oh. Um...

1564
01:34:47.159 --> 01:34:48.465
We need to talk.

1565
01:34:49.771 --> 01:34:50.902
Downstairs.

1566
01:35:03.959 --> 01:35:05.134
- See you. okay?
- Yeah.

1567
01:35:05.264 --> 01:35:07.658
Nope. hold on. Come here.
Both of you.

1568
01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:14.317
What's going on?
Why are you being so weird?

1569
01:35:17.624 --> 01:35:18.800
Um...

1570
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:21.411
I just got a call...

1571
01:35:23.021 --> 01:35:25.763
from Bill Workman
about a half hour ago.

1572
01:35:27.591 --> 01:35:30.550
There was an accident out on 75.

1573
01:35:34.250 --> 01:35:35.730
Shane got killed.

1574
01:35:48.699 --> 01:35:49.744
What?

1575
01:35:54.226 --> 01:35:55.401
I just saw him.

1576
01:35:59.971 --> 01:36:01.320
I'm sorry. son.

1577
01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:49.281
Get in.

1578
01:37:50.952 --> 01:37:52.344
What the fuck?

1579
01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:54.433
What the fuck?

1580
01:40:18.316 --> 01:40:19.491
Hey.

1581
01:40:20.405 --> 01:40:21.406
Hey.

1582
01:40:24.409 --> 01:40:26.107
Thought you said
that we were dry.

1583
01:40:26.237 --> 01:40:27.978
No. man. this is it.

1584
01:40:29.023 --> 01:40:31.286
Last two. I found a...

1585
01:40:31.416 --> 01:40:34.332
a sixer stashed
with the Christmas shit.

1586
01:40:35.203 --> 01:40:36.943
Mm. Nativity set?

1587
01:40:37.074 --> 01:40:38.075
Yeah.

1588
01:40:42.253 --> 01:40:44.125
I did pound
the other four. though.

1589
01:40:47.084 --> 01:40:48.129
That's fair.

1590
01:40:58.661 --> 01:40:59.662
Moose?

1591
01:41:02.578 --> 01:41:03.666
Are we cool?

1592
01:41:06.495 --> 01:41:07.931
Yeah. man.

1593
01:41:09.324 --> 01:41:10.803
We're cool.

1594
01:41:13.937 --> 01:41:15.112
Cool.

1595
01:41:15.243 --> 01:41:17.680
Fuck off. animals!

1596
01:41:17.810 --> 01:41:19.377
We're having a moment!

1597
01:41:20.596 --> 01:41:22.641
Fuck.

1598
01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:27.733
Oh. dude. I'm sorry
I punched you in the nose.

1599
01:41:27.864 --> 01:41:29.605
Oh. I... I didn't even feel it.

1600
01:41:30.171 --> 01:41:32.260
Yeah. okay.

1601
01:41:34.044 --> 01:41:35.306
Hmm.

1602
01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:38.092
All right. are you ready?

1603
01:41:38.744 --> 01:41:39.963
Yeah.

1604
01:41:40.094 --> 01:41:41.573
Yeah. let's make some dough.

1605
01:41:44.750 --> 01:41:45.969
Wait.

1606
01:41:52.323 --> 01:41:53.846
There's no glass on deck.

1607
01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:03.029
So look. man. I want
to pitch you a few ideas.

1608
01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:04.901
Yeah? What kind of ideas?

1609
01:42:05.031 --> 01:42:07.077
How we can double our return
on this bitch next summer.

1610
01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:10.298
- Does it involve Real Beer?
- Ooh!

1611
01:42:11.734 --> 01:42:13.039
Hundred percent.

1612
01:42:16.391 --> 01:42:18.044
Two fucking lines. goobs!

1613
01:42:18.175 --> 01:42:21.047
Give me two fucking lines!

1614
01:42:21.178 --> 01:42:23.485
- Right now!
- My turn! My turn!

1615
01:42:55.386 --> 01:42:56.735
Hey.[Brooke] Hey.

1616
01:42:56.866 --> 01:42:58.781
Hey. what's going on?
Are you leaving right now?

1617
01:42:58.911 --> 01:43:01.523
Yeah. Sorry. I drove by the pool
but I couldn't find you.

1618
01:43:01.653 --> 01:43:02.698
What happened to Tuesday?

1619
01:43:03.612 --> 01:43:05.875
When the AF says jump.
he jumps.

1620
01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:09.574
In two minutes.
we're taillights.

1621
01:43:09.705 --> 01:43:10.967
Just gotta hit the head.

1622
01:43:11.097 --> 01:43:12.098
Roger. Wilco.

1623
01:43:12.229 --> 01:43:13.839
Two minutes?

1624
01:43:14.710 --> 01:43:16.190
Here.

1625
01:43:17.713 --> 01:43:19.105
Take it.

1626
01:43:19.236 --> 01:43:20.498
What is it?

1627
01:43:21.195 --> 01:43:22.544
Open it. dum-dum.

1628
01:43:32.597 --> 01:43:33.903
A hanky?

1629
01:43:35.818 --> 01:43:37.776
So you don't have
to borrow your dad's.

1630
01:43:41.171 --> 01:43:42.564
One more thing.

1631
01:43:49.484 --> 01:43:51.747
I. um... I printed it
last night.

1632
01:44:07.241 --> 01:44:08.720
We don't say "goodbye."

1633
01:44:09.330 --> 01:44:10.418
Just...

1634
01:44:11.288 --> 01:44:12.420
"see you later."

1635
01:44:30.220 --> 01:44:31.308
Let's move out.

1636
01:44:39.664 --> 01:44:40.970
Another keeper.

1637
01:44:43.886 --> 01:44:45.061
See ya. A.J.

1638
01:44:49.413 --> 01:44:50.545
