but I can't say more about
an ongoing investigation.

104
00:05:02.862 --> 00:05:05.241

You can't keep me here if
you're not going to charge me.

115
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.586
Do you want to be charged?

116
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.793
I'm the mayor. do
you really believe

117
00:05:46.827 --> 00:05:48.034
that I would murder someone

118
00:05:48.068 --> 00:05:50.344
and then leave their
body in my damn pool?

119
00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:52.413
I mean. you've got the
victim's blood on your hands.

120
00:05:52.448 --> 00:05:54.172
Because I was trying to help.

121
00:05:54.206 --> 00:05:55.344
You know what?

122
00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:57.965
No. never mind. I'm not doing
this. I want my lawyer.

123
00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.896
I'm not answering any
more of your questions.

124
00:05:59.931 --> 00:06:01.551
Now. if you are not
going to charge me

125
00:06:01.586 --> 00:06:02.931
you need to let me go.

126
00:06:02.965 --> 00:06:07.275
Mayor Johnson. you are
the primary suspect.

127
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:08.896
So. I'm sure you're aware
that we can hold you

128
00:06:08.931 --> 00:06:12.137
for up to 48 hours
before pressing charges.

129
00:06:13.068 --> 00:06:16.517
You are not going to
hold me for 48 minutes.

130
00:06:16.551 --> 00:06:19.724
I will have your damn badge.

131
00:06:19.758 --> 00:06:20.931
We'll see about that.

132
00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.586
I want my phone call. I said
I want my damn phone call!

133
00:06:28.344 --> 00:06:30.413
I want my phone call.

134
00:06:30.448 --> 00:06:33.586
Careful. careful
now. working hand

135
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.172
won't serve you in prison.

136
00:06:35.206 --> 00:06:36.517
Mother what are you doing here?

137
00:06:36.551 --> 00:06:38.034
I came to help.

138
00:06:38.068 --> 00:06:39.965
Well what. bury me?

139
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.068
Ella. you don't exactly
have allies lining up

140
00:06:43.103 --> 00:06:44.931
outside the door.

141

Christie practically
sprinted out of here.

142
00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:50.275
Is she the one
who turned you in?

143
00:06:52.137 --> 00:06:53.931
I guess I could call Kendrick.

144
00:06:53.965 --> 00:06:56.517
I believe he's out
of the hospital

145
00:06:56.551 --> 00:06:59.413
but he's not exactly known
for being useful is he?

146
00:06:59.448 --> 00:07:01.827
You put him inthe hospital.

147
00:07:02.137 --> 00:07:05.206
I have no idea what
you're talking about dear.

148
00:07:06.448 --> 00:07:08.068
Do you want me to call Rex?

149
00:07:09.517 --> 00:07:12.862
Oh. you two are usually
Bonnie and Clyde.

150
00:07:12.896 --> 00:07:14.448
What's wrong?

151
00:07:14.482 --> 00:07:18.034
You know exactly what's
wrong with me and Rex.

152
00:07:18.068 --> 00:07:21.724
He killed my father
under your orders.

153
00:07:21.758 --> 00:07:22.758
Lower your voice.

154
00:07:24.068 --> 00:07:27.068
We're not going to discuss
things you don't understand.

155
00:07:27.103 --> 00:07:28.517
Why are you here?

156
00:07:28.551 --> 00:07:31.517
To help you. no matter
what's happened between us.

157
00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:35.655
we are still family and I am
not gonna let you go to prison.

158
00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:38.448
Now. this document gives
me power of attorney.

159
00:07:38.482 --> 00:07:40.827
I can hire you a lawyer
and make sure you get

160
00:07:40.862 --> 00:07:44.827
out of this without destroying
what's left of our legacy.

161
00:07:44.862 --> 00:07:49.517
Oh no. no. no. Oh. I am not
signing anything from you.

162
00:07:49.551 --> 00:07:51.793
Ella Mae. you don't have
any other options.

What do you want.

164
00:07:56.241 --> 00:07:58.310
Look. you have burned
all your bridges.

Let me help you. We both
know I've cleaned up

166
00:08:05.275 --> 00:08:06.689
your messes before.

167

St. Charles and the others?

then...there she was.

179
00:09:12.034 --> 00:09:13.137
Ella?

180
00:09:13.172 --> 00:09:17.517
Yes. she was arrested.
for Malik Thompson's murder.

181
00:09:18.344 --> 00:09:19.482
Malik's dead?

182
00:09:19.517 --> 00:09:21.896
Apparently they found
him in her pool.

183
00:09:21.931 --> 00:09:23.344
So she killed him too.

184
00:09:23.379 --> 00:09:26.172
It just doesn't make any
sense. I was just over there.

185
00:09:26.206 --> 00:09:30.241
She confessed. why would
she then go and kill Malik

186
00:09:30.275 --> 00:09:33.517
and leave a body for
the police to find?

187
00:09:33.551 --> 00:09:35.275
Why does your
mother do anything?

188
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.586
There's no reason she
wanted Malik dead.

189
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:38.965
Ella hated Malik.

190
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.344
he's the reason she
lost the church.

191
00:09:41.379 --> 00:09:43.000
The church isn't
worth killing for.

192
00:09:43.034 --> 00:09:45.275
And what was worth
killing St. Charles

193
00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:46.586
and Sherry Tucker and Payne?

194
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.275
-Stop.
-You stop.

195
00:09:48.689 --> 00:09:50.206
Stop making excuses.

196
00:09:50.241 --> 00:09:52.551
Your mom is not the victim here.

197
00:09:52.586 --> 00:09:54.241
She needs to pay for
what she did to Malik

198
00:09:54.275 --> 00:09:55.517
and those other people.

199
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.862
This was a mistake. I
shouldn't have come here.

200
00:09:59.896 --> 00:10:01.862
No. not if you're
looking for an excuse

201
00:10:01.896 --> 00:10:03.758
to give Ella a free pass.

202
00:10:03.793 --> 00:10:06.551
No. I was looking for
some understanding.

203
00:10:06.586 --> 00:10:08.482
Maybe that's just too
much to ask for.

204
00:10:08.517 --> 00:10:10.310
[cell phone ringing]

205
00:10:11.586 --> 00:10:12.413
Kendrick?

206
00:10:16.379 --> 00:10:19.862
Okay. I'll be right
over. Just...okay--

207
00:10:23.241 --> 00:10:24.310
Good night Levi.

208
00:10:26.724 --> 00:10:27.758
Good night.

209
00:10:30.965 --> 00:10:33.689
Burning the midnight oil. I see.

210
00:10:33.724 --> 00:10:36.034
Leona. it's been a long time.

211
00:10:36.793 --> 00:10:38.551
What are you doing here so late?

212
00:10:38.586 --> 00:10:41.241
Don't act so
surprised. Kimberly.

213
00:10:41.275 --> 00:10:44.448
You know. we were
overdue for a visit.

214
00:10:44.482 --> 00:10:46.068
Well. you could have
scheduled an appointment.

215
00:10:46.103 --> 00:10:47.034
I don't need one.

216
00:10:48.793 --> 00:10:51.379
I'm sure you've heard about
my daughter's unfortunate

217
00:10:51.413 --> 00:10:52.931
run-in with the law.

218
00:10:52.965 --> 00:10:54.965
Yes. that's why I'm here.

219
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.448
Someone needs to step in
while Ella is indisposed

220
00:10:57.482 --> 00:11:00.586
and since I'm city council.
president. I'm clearly--

221
00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:05.379
In a position to appoint me.
as acting mayor of Cyprus.

222
00:11:07.862 --> 00:11:10.206
Leona. I don't have
time for your games.

223
00:11:10.241 --> 00:11:11.827
Trust me. this is no game.

224
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.620
Cyprus is in chaos.
An embattled mayor.

225
00:11:17.655 --> 00:11:21.827
young black women going
missing. CEO's getting murdered.

226
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.448
The city needs a firm
hand to guide it.

227
00:11:26.482 --> 00:11:28.241
And you think that's you?

228
00:11:28.724 --> 00:11:31.000
Aren't you fresh out
of the psych ward?

229
00:11:34.379 --> 00:11:39.241
We both know I have always
been in control of my faculties

230
00:11:41.241 --> 00:11:42.689
but let's talk about you.

231
00:11:44.655 --> 00:11:46.862
You have always had such talent.

232
00:11:46.896 --> 00:11:49.896
especially when it comes to
cooking the city's books.

233
00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:53.689
You need to leave.

234
00:11:53.724 --> 00:11:55.551
Oh. don't be so dramatic.

235
00:11:56.793 --> 00:12:00.793
I'm grateful. you've
always provided assistance

236
00:12:00.827 --> 00:12:04.000
when I needed you to
facilitate some of my more

237
00:12:04.034 --> 00:12:06.379
sensitive business endeavors.

238
00:12:06.413 --> 00:12:08.793
Yeah. that's because
you blackmailed me.

239
00:12:08.827 --> 00:12:13.931
No. it was always a mutually
beneficial transaction.

240
00:12:13.965 --> 00:12:15.344
I scratched your back.

241
00:12:15.379 --> 00:12:16.586
With a hacksaw.

242
00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.862
And now you are going
to scratch my mine.

243
00:12:20.172 --> 00:12:23.482
You are going to secure the
necessary council votes for me

244
00:12:23.517 --> 00:12:27.344
to be placed as acting
mayor. effective immediately.

245
00:12:27.379 --> 00:12:30.206
And I will make
sure that my decades

246
00:12:30.241 --> 00:12:35.172
of documentation tracking
your financial creativity.

247
00:12:36.448 --> 00:12:37.931
don't see the light of day.

248
00:12:46.034 --> 00:12:49.137
Okay. well your pulse is steady.

249
00:12:49.172 --> 00:12:51.275
Are you having any pain
or trouble breathing?

250
00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:53.758
No. I just got a
little lightheaded.

251
00:12:54.758 --> 00:12:56.103
You didn't have to come
all the way over here.

252
00:12:56.137 --> 00:12:57.310
you look so nice.

253
00:12:57.344 --> 00:12:58.758
Are you crazy?

254
00:12:58.793 --> 00:13:01.655
Of course I did. that's my
little niece or nephew in there.

255
00:13:01.689 --> 00:13:03.827
I gotta make sure
they're straight.

256
00:13:03.862 --> 00:13:06.517
can't be fainting on us
like that. scaring us.

257
00:13:07.931 --> 00:13:10.758
But seriously. you should
consider going to the hospital.

258
00:13:10.793 --> 00:13:12.068
I can call your O.B.

259
00:13:12.103 --> 00:13:16.000
No. honestly. I just
got light headed.

260
00:13:16.034 --> 00:13:17.551
See. now you being stubborn.

261
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Now listen. I'm
worried about the baby.

262
00:13:21.034 --> 00:13:23.413
but my main concern is you.

263
00:13:23.448 --> 00:13:25.689
You never fainted like
that before Stacia.

264
00:13:25.724 --> 00:13:27.724
Well. I've never been
pregnant before babe.

265
00:13:27.758 --> 00:13:30.482
I'm not playing.
that's not funny.

266
00:13:30.517 --> 00:13:35.103
Seriously. I got overwhelmed
by the news of Malik's death.

267
00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:40.413
Listen. I get it. Malik
was your boss. your friend.

268
00:13:41.758 --> 00:13:43.275
and I know you're
gonna miss him.

269
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:44.379
that's understandable.

270
00:13:46.551 --> 00:13:49.517
Yeah. Listen.

271
00:13:49.551 --> 00:13:53.000
I'm...I'm just tired.

272
00:13:53.034 --> 00:13:54.068
I wanna go to sleep.

273
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:57.103
I'll call my doctor
in the morning.

274
00:13:57.137 --> 00:13:59.000
-Stacia--
-I will.

275
00:14:01.655 --> 00:14:04.448
All right. get you some rest.

276
00:14:04.482 --> 00:14:07.172
I'm gonna step out for a minute
and talk to Christie okay?

277
00:14:07.206 --> 00:14:08.000
Okay.

278
00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:13.000
Christie I mean it. thank
you for coming all the way

279
00:14:13.034 --> 00:14:14.689
over here to check on me.

280
00:14:14.724 --> 00:14:15.551
Of course.

281
00:14:22.241 --> 00:14:23.655
Stop fussing.

282
00:14:24.793 --> 00:14:26.000
Well. stop fainting.

283
00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:29.482
You get yourself some
rest. you understand me?

284
00:14:29.517 --> 00:14:30.655
I'll be back.

285
00:14:39.137 --> 00:14:40.689
Can you please stay the night?

286
00:14:41.827 --> 00:14:43.551
Listen. I know I'm
probably being paranoid

287
00:14:43.586 --> 00:14:46.103
but I am very worried
about her and our baby.

288
00:14:46.137 --> 00:14:49.206
That's not paranoia. that's
just you being a good dad.

289
00:14:50.172 --> 00:14:51.379
And of course I'll stay.

290
00:14:51.413 --> 00:14:52.862
Thank you so much.

291
00:14:52.896 --> 00:14:55.034
and look. you don't
have to stay late.

292
00:14:55.068 --> 00:14:57.172
I just need someone
here when she wakes up.

293
00:14:58.137 --> 00:15:00.379
And where are you going to be?

294
00:15:00.413 --> 00:15:02.758
I'm going to the jail
to see mom as soon as

295
00:15:02.793 --> 00:15:05.689
visiting hours start. my dad
said that she being held.

296
00:15:05.724 --> 00:15:07.206
she ain't even been charged yet.

297
00:15:07.241 --> 00:15:08.793
I think this whole
thing is just crazy.

298
00:15:08.827 --> 00:15:10.413
there's no way she killed Malik.

299
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:13.827
Why you looking like that?

300
00:15:13.862 --> 00:15:15.448
You know. she ain't do it right?

301
00:15:16.379 --> 00:15:18.620
Come on now. she's the mayor.

302
00:15:18.655 --> 00:15:21.344
Our mother is not capable
of murder. you know that.

303
00:15:22.344 --> 00:15:24.931
Yeah. you're right Kendrick.

304
00:15:25.379 --> 00:15:26.620
[chuckling]

305
00:15:26.655 --> 00:15:29.275
All right. I'm going to go set
that guest room up for you.

306
00:15:34.172 --> 00:15:37.413
[dramatic music]

307
00:15:37.448 --> 00:15:39.827

being taken in for questioning

310
00:15:46.586 --> 00:15:50.206
in the murder of Upsurge
CEO. Malik Thompson.

311
00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:53.275
It has now been confirmed
that the Cyprus city council

312
00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:56.482
has placed Leona Bird in
the role of acting mayor

313
00:15:56.517 --> 00:15:57.172
[screaming] What?

314
00:15:57.206 --> 00:15:58.482
Effective immediately.

315
00:15:58.517 --> 00:16:00.758
Oh. hell no. Officer!

316
00:16:01.344 --> 00:16:04.517
Officer. guard. I need
to make my phone call.

317
00:16:05.172 --> 00:16:08.586
You know you hear me. I
need to make my phone call.

318
00:16:18.517 --> 00:16:20.862
I'm here to see my mother
Mayor Ella Johnson.

319
00:16:22.758 --> 00:16:25.000
She's not the mayor anymore.

320
00:16:25.034 --> 00:16:26.689
Man just let me see my mother.

321
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.137
Your name?

322
00:16:29.172 --> 00:16:30.586
Kendrick Murphy.

323
00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:31.827
Sign in and take a seat.

324
00:16:50.482 --> 00:16:51.310
Come with me.

325
00:16:53.551 --> 00:16:54.379
About time.

326
00:16:55.344 --> 00:16:56.310
[door buzzing]

327
00:16:58.758 --> 00:17:00.344
-Kendrick.
-Mom.

328
00:17:00.379 --> 00:17:02.034
[Policeman] Hands
off the prisoner.

329
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.103
Prisoner?

330
00:17:04.137 --> 00:17:05.827
She hasn't even been charged.

331
00:17:05.862 --> 00:17:08.206
Y'all shouldn't even be
holding her in here anyway.

332
00:17:08.241 --> 00:17:09.551
Do you wanna visit or
do you want your mom

333
00:17:09.586 --> 00:17:10.724
to go back to her cell?

334
00:17:12.724 --> 00:17:13.551
We good. man.

335
00:17:23.172 --> 00:17:25.586
Oh Kendrick. baby
thanks for coming.

336
00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:27.827
Of course. Mom. you know I'm
gonna get you out of here.

337
00:17:27.862 --> 00:17:30.620
Baby I need a lawyer.
I need one right now.

338
00:17:30.655 --> 00:17:31.931
What about Stacia do you
think she'll come down

339
00:17:31.965 --> 00:17:32.827
and represent me?

340
00:17:35.482 --> 00:17:37.448
What you don't
think she'll do it ?

341
00:17:37.482 --> 00:17:40.758
It's not that mom. it was
a incident last night.

342
00:17:40.793 --> 00:17:42.448
Stacia fainted.

343
00:17:42.482 --> 00:17:43.931
Is the baby okay?

344
00:17:43.965 --> 00:17:45.482
The baby's okay. she's okay.

345
00:17:45.517 --> 00:17:48.034
but I just don't want her
running around right now.

346
00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:49.448
Really Kendrick?

347
00:17:49.482 --> 00:17:50.724
I mean. this is
kind of important.

348
00:17:50.758 --> 00:17:53.000
I know Ma. and we're
going to handle it.

349
00:17:53.034 --> 00:17:55.931
if not Stacia. I'll
find you somebody else.

350
00:17:55.965 --> 00:17:57.655
I know you didn't kill Malik.

351
00:17:57.689 --> 00:18:00.103
Thank you. baby. I
needed to hear that.

352
00:18:00.137 --> 00:18:03.068
you are the only person that
I have in my corner right now.

353
00:18:04.172 --> 00:18:05.310
But Ma. you got
Christie and dad too.

354
00:18:05.344 --> 00:18:08.413
No. I can't deal with them.

355
00:18:08.448 --> 00:18:10.413
Look you gotta
get me out of here

356
00:18:10.448 --> 00:18:12.620
because Leona is
already making moves.

357
00:18:12.655 --> 00:18:14.034
I don't know what
she's going to pull.

358
00:18:14.068 --> 00:18:15.448
while I'm locked away in here.

359
00:18:15.482 --> 00:18:18.172
Don't worry. we gonna handle it.

360
00:18:18.206 --> 00:18:20.448
Just keep your head down
and don't make any waves.

361
00:18:20.482 --> 00:18:22.965
I'm gonna talk to Stacia. we're
going to get you out of here.

362
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.586
I promise you that. all right?

363
00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:25.862
Why thank you baby.

364
00:18:25.896 --> 00:18:26.827
-I promise.
-Okay thank you.

365
00:18:26.862 --> 00:18:27.931
-I love you. Mom.
-[Ella] I love you too.

366
00:18:27.965 --> 00:18:29.206
Don't worry about
nothing. I got you.

367
00:18:29.241 --> 00:18:30.275
[Ella] Oh. get me
out of here Kendrick.

368
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:31.137
-Okay.
-[Ella] Please.

369
00:18:31.172 --> 00:18:32.172
I got you. don't worry.

370
00:18:33.482 --> 00:18:35.448
-[Ella] What are you doing?
-What the hell?

371
00:18:35.482 --> 00:18:36.379
What are you doing?
-[indistinct arguing]

372
00:18:36.413 --> 00:18:37.034
[Policeman] You're under arrest.

373
00:18:37.068 --> 00:18:38.379
[Kendrick] For what?

374
00:18:38.413 --> 00:18:39.310
[Ella] What did he do?

375
00:18:39.344 --> 00:18:40.448
What are the charges?

376
00:18:40.896 --> 00:18:42.206
Not staying dead.

377
00:18:43.137 --> 00:18:45.586
[Kendrick] What are
you talking about?

378
00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:47.103
What the hell is wrong with you?

379
00:18:47.137 --> 00:18:49.137
Why are you doing that?

380
00:18:49.172 --> 00:18:50.551
I'm the mayor.

381
00:18:50.586 --> 00:18:53.344
I'm bringing law
and order to Cyprus.

382
00:18:54.379 --> 00:18:56.965
My law. my order.

383
00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:03.206
I should have never trusted you.

384
00:19:03.241 --> 00:19:04.655
Well. to be fair. you're the one

385
00:19:04.689 --> 00:19:07.068
who got yourself locked up.

386
00:19:07.103 --> 00:19:10.000
I'm just making the best
of a messy situation.

387
00:19:10.034 --> 00:19:11.482
You can't keep me
locked up in here.

388
00:19:11.517 --> 00:19:13.689
I didn't kill Malik. I
haven't even been charged.

389
00:19:13.724 --> 00:19:15.448
Maybe. maybe not.

390
00:19:16.517 --> 00:19:20.620
but I'm pretty sure I still
have you for at least 48 hours.

391
00:19:20.655 --> 00:19:23.172
I could do so. so
much in that time.

392
00:19:25.517 --> 00:19:30.034
This was always your
plan. Oh. you set me up.

393
00:19:30.068 --> 00:19:31.482
You killed Malik.

394
00:19:32.758 --> 00:19:34.344
You set me up. you killed Malik.

395
00:19:34.379 --> 00:19:36.586
you put his body in my
pool. you set me up!

396
00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:39.965
You dirty bitch. you're not
gonna get away with this!

397
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.206
Dirty bitch. she's the one.
she killed him. Arrest her.

398
00:19:43.241 --> 00:19:45.551
she's the murderer.
she's the murderer!

399
00:19:45.586 --> 00:19:47.793
You're not gonna
get away with this!

400
00:19:50.931 --> 00:19:52.034
[chattering]

401
00:19:52.068 --> 00:19:53.482
-Cell already.
-Don't touch me.

402
00:19:53.517 --> 00:19:55.586
Look. I demand my call.

403
00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:56.724
No more phone calls.

404
00:19:56.758 --> 00:19:57.724
I have rights.

405
00:19:57.758 --> 00:19:59.034
[Policeman] Not anymore.

406
00:20:04.206 --> 00:20:06.586
Folic acid. vitamin C.

407
00:20:07.793 --> 00:20:10.724
Oh I know. Kendrick
made a spreadsheet

408
00:20:10.758 --> 00:20:13.620
along with every recommended
prenatal vitamin.

409
00:20:13.655 --> 00:20:15.655
He's just excited.

410
00:20:15.689 --> 00:20:16.482
I know.

411
00:20:19.965 --> 00:20:22.241
You didn't have
to stay the night.

412
00:20:22.275 --> 00:20:25.896
I don't mind. it feels
good to be needed.

413
00:20:25.931 --> 00:20:27.482
to be taking care of someone.

414
00:20:30.206 --> 00:20:32.551
I thought Kendrick would
be back by now though.

415
00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.241
I'm sure he'll be back soon.

416
00:20:36.206 --> 00:20:37.965
Go get your day started.

417
00:20:39.862 --> 00:20:40.689
Okay.

418
00:20:43.551 --> 00:20:46.379
I promise that I have
met my fainting quota

419
00:20:46.413 --> 00:20:47.620
for this pregnancy.

420
00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.896
All right. girl. I'll
take the hint and I'll go.

421
00:20:57.827 --> 00:21:02.344
But listen. I am so happy
for you and Kendrick.

422
00:21:02.379 --> 00:21:04.103
You're going to
be a great mother

423
00:21:05.517 --> 00:21:07.827
and I might be being biased.

424
00:21:07.862 --> 00:21:10.137
but I think your baby's
got the best dad.

425
00:21:13.413 --> 00:21:14.241
Me too.

426
00:21:15.655 --> 00:21:16.862
All right. I'll
talk to you later?

427
00:21:16.896 --> 00:21:17.827
Yes.

428
00:21:23.896 --> 00:21:25.517
Thank you.

429
00:21:25.551 --> 00:21:26.344
You're welcome.

430
00:21:26.965 --> 00:21:29.862
[suspenseful music]

431
00:21:40.482 --> 00:21:45.448
Levi Stirling. Just
the man I want to see.

432
00:21:45.827 --> 00:21:46.931
Lady bird.

433
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.172
Well I haven't been called
that in quite some time.

434
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:55.827
I appreciate it. Others
should follow your example

435
00:21:55.862 --> 00:21:58.689
and show me the proper respect.

436
00:21:58.724 --> 00:22:01.068
Well. from what I hear.
you're not exactly the most

437
00:22:01.103 --> 00:22:03.413
popular member of the
New Hope Church. family.

438
00:22:03.724 --> 00:22:06.758
Well. Jesus wasn't
always popular either.

439
00:22:07.586 --> 00:22:08.793
What can I do for you?

440
00:22:09.793 --> 00:22:11.275
As I'm sure you've heard.

441
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:13.379
I'm the new mayor of Cyprus.

442
00:22:13.413 --> 00:22:15.206
Acting mayor. right?

443
00:22:15.241 --> 00:22:16.965
Well that's semantics.

444
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.551
with my daughter
out of the picture.

445
00:22:18.586 --> 00:22:21.862
I'll be making some changes.
one of which involves you.

446
00:22:22.689 --> 00:22:24.137
How so?

447
00:22:24.172 --> 00:22:26.206
I'd like to buy
New Hope from you.

448
00:22:27.482 --> 00:22:28.724
Not looking to sell.

449
00:22:30.172 --> 00:22:35.103
What if I had something to
sweeten the offer. beyond money?

450
00:22:36.758 --> 00:22:39.724
No disrespect. but I have
had more than enough dealings

451
00:22:39.758 --> 00:22:42.965
with the bird women
to last a lifetime.

452
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.172
You have nothing I want.

453
00:22:45.068 --> 00:22:46.482
What about your mobility?

454
00:22:48.172 --> 00:22:48.965
Hmm?

455
00:22:49.689 --> 00:22:53.862
You're still a young
virile man Levi.

456
00:22:53.896 --> 00:22:56.620
you have your whole
life ahead of you.

457
00:22:56.655 --> 00:23:01.379
Wouldn't you want to have your
full range of motion back?

458
00:23:03.034 --> 00:23:05.103
I have been to specialists.

459
00:23:05.137 --> 00:23:08.689
spent months in extremely
painful physical therapy.

460
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.137
you can't deliver that.

461
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.275
Oh Levi. if I
make a promise.

462
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:18.482
I always deliver.

463
00:23:21.965 --> 00:23:24.103
You make it so I don't
need this anymore?

464
00:23:25.206 --> 00:23:27.068
Maybe we have something
to talk about.

465
00:23:27.655 --> 00:23:30.413
[mysterious music]

466
00:23:32.206 --> 00:23:33.965
[Rex] How are you my friend?

467
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.724
Rex. just in time to
join me for a drink.

468
00:23:37.758 --> 00:23:42.413
Sounds like fun. I didn't come
here for a nightcap Leona.

469
00:23:42.448 --> 00:23:43.689
Suit yourself.

470
00:23:43.724 --> 00:23:45.206
I see you didn't waste much time

471
00:23:45.241 --> 00:23:47.724
getting comfortable
in Ella's place.

472
00:23:47.758 --> 00:23:49.896
Well. Ella sold my home.

473
00:23:49.931 --> 00:23:52.586
so I might as well
make good use of hers.

474
00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.068
since she's not using it.

475
00:23:55.482 --> 00:23:57.241
This place is a
crime scene Leona.

476
00:23:58.344 --> 00:24:01.758
Well. I told the
police forensic team to

477
00:24:01.793 --> 00:24:03.793
put a rush on gathering
their evidence.

478
00:24:05.517 --> 00:24:08.724
Besides. I'm not planning on
taking a dip in the pool.

479
00:24:09.344 --> 00:24:11.379
[chuckling]

480
00:24:11.413 --> 00:24:13.241
Cold blooded Leona.

481
00:24:13.275 --> 00:24:15.344
What do you want. Rex?

482
00:24:17.103 --> 00:24:22.068
Well. I came by to talk
about a little business.

483
00:24:23.103 --> 00:24:24.000
madam mayor.

484
00:24:25.172 --> 00:24:26.137
Oh?

485
00:24:28.103 --> 00:24:30.655
I want you to green light
my transportation company...

486
00:24:31.965 --> 00:24:34.827
[sinister music]

487
00:24:36.379 --> 00:24:37.379
...and I'm not asking.

488
00:24:40.482 --> 00:24:42.620
There's no need for threats.

489
00:24:42.655 --> 00:24:46.068
You and I hold more secrets
than my husband's silly journal

490
00:24:46.103 --> 00:24:47.448
could ever contain.

491
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.620
Really?

492
00:24:50.655 --> 00:24:54.034
I'm more than happy to
approve your little business.

493
00:24:54.068 --> 00:24:56.689
In fact. I'll put a rush on it.

494
00:24:57.862 --> 00:25:00.103
Why are you doing that. Leona?

495
00:25:00.137 --> 00:25:02.310
Because I want to hire you.

496
00:25:04.068 --> 00:25:07.275
I have a special piece of cargo.

497
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:09.241
I need you to deliver to me.

498
00:25:12.965 --> 00:25:14.482
You're something else Leona.

499
00:25:18.827 --> 00:25:21.172
Stacia. what are you doing
here this time of night?

500
00:25:22.068 --> 00:25:24.310
I was actually
looking for Kendrick.

501
00:25:24.344 --> 00:25:25.103
Have you seen him?

502
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:28.689
No. but he said he's going
over to the jail earlier.

503
00:25:28.724 --> 00:25:30.551
That was this morning.

504
00:25:30.586 --> 00:25:31.793
I've been calling
his phone all day.

505
00:25:31.827 --> 00:25:33.758
it's going straight
to voicemail.

506
00:25:33.793 --> 00:25:35.620
Have you checked the hospital?

507
00:25:35.655 --> 00:25:37.931
Yes. he hasn't been admitted.

508
00:25:38.931 --> 00:25:40.310
It's not like him to go M.I.A.

509
00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.379
You're right. especially
with you being pregnant.

510
00:25:44.413 --> 00:25:45.241
Right.

511
00:25:46.137 --> 00:25:47.724
Where do you think he could be?

512
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:51.793
[dramatic music]

513
00:26:06.103 --> 00:26:07.000
Yes. Rex.

514
00:26:10.724 --> 00:26:11.551
Thank you.

515
00:26:29.379 --> 00:26:32.206
Philomena. welcome home dear.

516
00:26:36.103 --> 00:26:37.310
Forgive me. Willie.

517
00:26:37.344 --> 00:26:39.482
I can't remember how
you like your tea.

518
00:26:40.586 --> 00:26:43.413
I prefer mine piping hot.

519
00:26:43.448 --> 00:26:44.586
I hope you slept well.

520
00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.758
What am I doing here. Leona?

521
00:26:46.793 --> 00:26:48.931
Well. I missed your company.

522
00:26:48.965 --> 00:26:51.379
You never came to visit
me when I was locked

523
00:26:51.413 --> 00:26:53.137
away in that sanitarium.

524
00:26:53.172 --> 00:26:54.482
-Leona--
-Surprisingly.

525
00:26:54.517 --> 00:26:59.103
since you were so instrumental
in me being sent there.

526
00:27:00.862 --> 00:27:04.448
I'm sorry. I had no choice.

527
00:27:04.482 --> 00:27:09.241
Don't apologize. I kept
myself very well occupied.

528
00:27:10.724 --> 00:27:14.448
And I managed to
keep tabs on you.

529
00:27:16.448 --> 00:27:18.586
You have been very busy. dear.

530
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.965
but we'll talk about
that later.

531
00:27:22.758 --> 00:27:24.758
Right now. I need
something from you.

532
00:27:26.103 --> 00:27:27.413
What?

533
00:27:27.448 --> 00:27:28.275
Anything.

534
00:27:29.517 --> 00:27:31.448
You always had your
finger on the pulse.

535
00:27:31.482 --> 00:27:35.413
always knew the latest
experimental treatments.

536
00:27:35.448 --> 00:27:38.586
made connections with
those breaking ground

537
00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:43.275
in various fields. especially
those who weren't concerned

538
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:48.793
with pesky little things like
regulations. or FDA approval.

539
00:27:49.793 --> 00:27:51.379
What are you getting at Leona?

540
00:27:53.931 --> 00:27:56.965
I need for you to
connect me with someone.

541
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.344
A physician. Someone
who specializes

542
00:28:00.379 --> 00:28:02.137
in the field of mobility.

543
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:06.344
Yes pastor. whatever Jabar needs

544
00:28:06.379 --> 00:28:09.068
for Malik's funeral. let's
make sure we provide it.

545
00:28:09.103 --> 00:28:10.000
Tamra as well.

546
00:28:10.034 --> 00:28:11.448
[knocking]

547
00:28:12.827 --> 00:28:17.206
Bye. thank you. I need to
run. but I'll talk soon. bye.

548
00:28:18.517 --> 00:28:21.241
Lady bird. you're back.

549
00:28:21.275 --> 00:28:24.068
Well. I come bearing gifts.

550
00:28:24.103 --> 00:28:27.862
Never say I don't
deliver on my promises.

551
00:28:34.275 --> 00:28:35.862
And what is this?

552
00:28:35.896 --> 00:28:39.206
That is the direct
line of the physician.

553
00:28:39.241 --> 00:28:40.793
that's going to heal you.

554
00:28:41.379 --> 00:28:42.517
Who is this?

555
00:28:42.551 --> 00:28:45.862
Some voodoo priestess or
some shady back alley doctor

556
00:28:45.896 --> 00:28:47.655
you're going to
have paralyze me?

557
00:28:47.689 --> 00:28:51.655
I assure you. it's all
perfectly legitimate.

558
00:28:51.689 --> 00:28:52.896
Leona. I've already spoken with

559
00:28:52.931 --> 00:28:54.586
the best specialist in New York.

560
00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:56.689
Which makes it even
more fortunate.

561
00:28:56.724 --> 00:28:59.620
that you are currently
here at Cyprus.

562
00:28:59.655 --> 00:29:02.000
That particular physician

563
00:29:02.034 --> 00:29:05.655
works out of a private
medical facility. here.

564
00:29:09.586 --> 00:29:11.275
I think you're playing me.

565
00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:13.000
I assure you. I'm not.

566
00:29:14.862 --> 00:29:16.586
What do you have to lose?

567
00:29:18.034 --> 00:29:21.586
Go meet the doctor. if you
don't feel comfortable.

568
00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:23.448
don't let the doctor treat you.

569
00:29:23.482 --> 00:29:26.827
but think about all
you have to gain. oh.

570
00:29:27.275 --> 00:29:28.931
You can even coach
your little girl.

571
00:29:28.965 --> 00:29:30.689
at one of her soccer games.

572
00:29:30.724 --> 00:29:33.034
I hear she's a
wonderful athlete.

573
00:29:33.068 --> 00:29:34.965
Don't talk about my daughter.

574
00:29:38.724 --> 00:29:39.689
As you wish.

575
00:29:41.137 --> 00:29:44.517
I took the Liberty of
having this drawn up.

576
00:29:45.689 --> 00:29:49.379
If it works. I secure
half of New Hope.

577
00:29:54.172 --> 00:29:55.241
Do we have a deal?

578
00:29:58.827 --> 00:30:01.206
Only if it works.

579
00:30:01.241 --> 00:30:02.137
Oh it will.

580
00:30:04.655 --> 00:30:05.551
[door slamming]

581
00:30:05.586 --> 00:30:07.310
[woman] You better
not lose my jewelry.

582
00:30:07.344 --> 00:30:09.827
Hey. hey. let me out of here.

583
00:30:09.862 --> 00:30:12.103
I still want my
lawyer. I want my call.

584
00:30:12.137 --> 00:30:14.655
-What?
-You hear me.

585
00:30:14.689 --> 00:30:15.482
Damn it.

586
00:30:16.965 --> 00:30:18.586
How long have you been in here?

587
00:30:20.689 --> 00:30:24.793
I don't know. I don't have
a watch or a damn phone.

588
00:30:26.896 --> 00:30:28.068
Aren't you the mayor?

589
00:30:28.103 --> 00:30:29.655
Yes.

590
00:30:29.689 --> 00:30:32.586
Yeah saw on the news. you
killed someone. that CEO.

591
00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:34.896
No. I did not.

592
00:30:34.931 --> 00:30:37.000
All right. no judgment.

593
00:30:39.103 --> 00:30:40.482
He probably had it coming.

594
00:30:41.827 --> 00:30:42.724
I'm Jalisa.

595
00:30:44.103 --> 00:30:45.000
Hello.

596
00:30:45.034 --> 00:30:48.068
I know. Why are you in holding?

597
00:30:48.103 --> 00:30:49.586
They don't got you in a suite?

598
00:30:50.827 --> 00:30:53.172
I haven't been charged
for your information.

599
00:30:54.034 --> 00:30:57.482
And also. they haven't given me
a lawyer or a damn phone call.

600
00:30:58.689 --> 00:30:59.758
Well they like to
hold out on that

601
00:30:59.793 --> 00:31:01.034
for as long as possible.

602
00:31:02.793 --> 00:31:04.551
I can tell you this
ain't your first time.

603
00:31:04.586 --> 00:31:07.655
No. they like to
harass girls like me.

604
00:31:08.241 --> 00:31:10.620
Oh. so what does that mean?

605
00:31:11.931 --> 00:31:14.275
Meaning they call
you Madam Mayor.

606
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:15.482
and they just call me Madam.

607
00:31:16.172 --> 00:31:18.655
What. you run women like
a pimp or something?

608
00:31:18.689 --> 00:31:22.000
I don't run girls.
I protect them.

609
00:31:23.862 --> 00:31:27.310
At least I did. no one's
protecting them now.

610
00:31:27.344 --> 00:31:28.827
Why. 'cause you're in here?

611
00:31:28.862 --> 00:31:32.310
No. because young black
women are being snatched up

612
00:31:32.344 --> 00:31:34.758
all over the state.
this is your city.

613
00:31:34.793 --> 00:31:36.172
don't you watch the news?

614
00:31:36.206 --> 00:31:37.413
So wait a minute.

615
00:31:37.448 --> 00:31:41.862
you're telling me that
all of those women.

616
00:31:42.793 --> 00:31:43.689
they weren't working girls?

617
00:31:43.724 --> 00:31:47.655
No. but does that matter?

618
00:31:47.689 --> 00:31:49.241
They're still missing.

619
00:31:49.275 --> 00:31:51.551
they're still being
treated the same.

620
00:31:51.586 --> 00:31:53.482
People think black
girls can just disappear

621
00:31:53.517 --> 00:31:56.724
and it won't matter. We matter.

622
00:31:56.758 --> 00:31:58.000
Damn. I agree with you.

623
00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:01.482
So. why are you in here?

624
00:32:01.517 --> 00:32:05.448
Cause one of my girls.
Candy. she went missing.

625
00:32:05.482 --> 00:32:06.310
Candy?

626
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.724
[whooshing sound]

627
00:32:08.758 --> 00:32:10.379
I have a little treat for you.

628
00:32:10.413 --> 00:32:12.344
You don't have to
get me anything Ella.

629
00:32:12.379 --> 00:32:14.724
just being here with you
is good enough for me.

630
00:32:26.655 --> 00:32:27.758
Ella Mae.

631
00:32:30.034 --> 00:32:31.827
you're really beautiful.

632
00:32:31.862 --> 00:32:33.068
You know Candy?

633
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:37.172
That doesn't surprise
me. she's very sweet.

634
00:32:37.206 --> 00:32:39.172
We just started
working together.

635
00:32:39.206 --> 00:32:40.896
So. she's missing?

636
00:32:40.931 --> 00:32:43.586
Yeah. and I've been
asking around.

637
00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:45.241
started asking questions
to the wrong cop.

638
00:32:45.275 --> 00:32:46.689
turns out he was undercover.

639
00:32:46.724 --> 00:32:48.689
That's why he arrested you?

640
00:32:48.724 --> 00:32:51.068
That's how they like
to keep us in line.

641
00:32:51.103 --> 00:32:52.586
I know the routine by now.

642
00:32:54.413 --> 00:32:57.862
Candy. she's a good girl.

643
00:32:57.896 --> 00:33:01.172
It's funny how that line
gets blurred though. huh?

644
00:33:01.206 --> 00:33:03.344
I mean. look at you.
you're a good girl.

645
00:33:03.379 --> 00:33:07.000
Madam Mayor probably
came from a good family.

646
00:33:07.034 --> 00:33:09.655
now you're looking
at a murder charge.

647
00:33:09.689 --> 00:33:14.655
Yeah well. I don't think
anybody thinks I'm good anymore.

648
00:33:16.862 --> 00:33:21.551
I have definitely
made some mistakes.

649
00:33:21.586 --> 00:33:23.620
So you did murder that
guy. does he know?

650
00:33:23.655 --> 00:33:25.413
No. I did not.

651
00:33:27.931 --> 00:33:30.827
[cell phone ringing]

652
00:33:30.862 --> 00:33:32.000
Wait a minute.

653
00:33:32.965 --> 00:33:35.000
you got a phone.

654
00:33:35.034 --> 00:33:36.724
All that thinking you're
doing ain't gonna help you.

655
00:33:36.758 --> 00:33:38.000
just throw down.

656
00:33:41.172 --> 00:33:43.068
Good afternoon.
I'm Anita Robinson

657
00:33:43.103 --> 00:33:47.206
with WQCL TV. we interrupt
our scheduled programming

658
00:33:47.241 --> 00:33:50.275
to bring you a press
conference from acting mayor

659
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:53.517
Leona Bird. live from
Cyprus City Hall.

660
00:33:53.551 --> 00:33:55.137
You watching this?

661
00:33:55.172 --> 00:33:57.793
Leona. what the
hell are you doing?

662
00:33:57.827 --> 00:34:02.827
[Leona] Good afternoon. I wanted
to take this opportunity

663
00:34:02.862 --> 00:34:06.068
to formally introduce myself.

664
00:34:06.103 --> 00:34:08.931
-I am mayor Leona Bird.
-[camera shutters clicking]

665
00:34:08.965 --> 00:34:10.172
[reporters shouting]

666
00:34:10.206 --> 00:34:12.275
Calm down. there will
be plenty of time for us

667
00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:13.931
to get to know
each other better.

668
00:34:15.379 --> 00:34:19.413
Due to my daughter. Ella
Johnson's unfortunate

669
00:34:19.448 --> 00:34:22.310
entanglement with
the legal system.

670
00:34:22.344 --> 00:34:27.034
it was my duty at the request
of the Cyprus City Council

671
00:34:27.068 --> 00:34:31.931
to step in as acting
mayor. Council woman Davis.

672
00:34:31.965 --> 00:34:34.827
I am always happy to
do whatever it takes

673
00:34:34.862 --> 00:34:36.482
for the city of Cyprus

674
00:34:36.517 --> 00:34:39.931
and I am honored that
you and the council

675
00:34:39.965 --> 00:34:42.310
have asked me to
take on this role.

676
00:34:44.655 --> 00:34:47.379
Citizens of Cyprus.

677
00:34:48.551 --> 00:34:53.172
the murder of Malik
Thompson was a tragedy.

678
00:34:53.206 --> 00:34:55.482
but it is not the only one.

679
00:34:56.689 --> 00:35:01.000
Cyprus has lost
its moral compass.

680
00:35:01.034 --> 00:35:02.655
Moral compass.

681
00:35:02.689 --> 00:35:05.344
you lucky your ass don't
get struck by lightning.

682
00:35:05.379 --> 00:35:06.517
[laughing]

683
00:35:06.551 --> 00:35:07.931
And as you well know.
young black women

684
00:35:07.965 --> 00:35:11.862
are disappearing at
an alarming rate.

685
00:35:11.896 --> 00:35:17.034
As mayor I will do whatever it
takes to protect our girls.

686
00:35:17.068 --> 00:35:17.896
[lite applause]

687
00:35:17.931 --> 00:35:20.896
Cyprus is in a
state of emergency.

688
00:35:21.965 --> 00:35:24.517
That's why effective
immediately.

689
00:35:24.551 --> 00:35:28.241
I am instituting
a citywide curfew.

690
00:35:29.724 --> 00:35:33.689
All citizens of Cyprus must
be in their homes by 7:00 p.m.

691
00:35:33.724 --> 00:35:37.413
-unless otherwise authorized.
-Curfew. Please.

692
00:35:37.448 --> 00:35:39.000
Ain't nobody gonna
listen to no damn curfew.

693
00:35:39.034 --> 00:35:41.689
To ensure that this
is properly enforced.

694
00:35:41.724 --> 00:35:45.206
and that Cypress
citizens remain safe.

695
00:35:45.241 --> 00:35:48.206
I have designated a special unit

696
00:35:48.241 --> 00:35:52.137
of police officers.
to enforce the curfew

697
00:35:52.172 --> 00:35:55.758
and other necessary regulations.

698
00:35:55.793 --> 00:35:58.586
Heretofore they will be known

699
00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:01.655
as the squadron
of faith officers.

700
00:36:01.689 --> 00:36:02.551
[boots thumping on ground]

701
00:36:03.827 --> 00:36:07.103
They'll be adorned with
this elegant bird pin.

702
00:36:09.103 --> 00:36:11.517
Citizens of Cyprus.

703
00:36:11.551 --> 00:36:15.551
know that the faith
officers are here for you.

704
00:36:15.586 --> 00:36:18.103
You are wild. you crazy bitch.

705
00:36:18.137 --> 00:36:20.310
They're people you can trust.

706
00:36:20.344 --> 00:36:22.758
Thank you and have
a blessed day.

707
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.724
[softly singing]

708
00:36:35.103 --> 00:36:35.965
[Pastor] You okay?

709
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.931
Yeah. I'm fine.

710
00:36:40.517 --> 00:36:42.931
Just searching
for some guidance.

711
00:36:42.965 --> 00:36:44.896
I've always been able
to find that here.

712
00:36:45.827 --> 00:36:47.068
even in a new church.

713
00:36:49.172 --> 00:36:51.206
Spirit can make any
building a home.

714
00:36:52.793 --> 00:36:55.413
Look. sorry to hear
about your mother.

715
00:36:58.241 --> 00:36:59.034
Thank you.

716
00:37:00.344 --> 00:37:01.931
I'm not sure the
women in my family

717
00:37:01.965 --> 00:37:04.413
have always deserved
that compassion.

718
00:37:05.689 --> 00:37:08.379
Hey. God's grace is
for everyone.

719
00:37:09.344 --> 00:37:10.896
They just have to want it.

720
00:37:17.034 --> 00:37:20.310
Pastor. have you ever
had to make the decision

721
00:37:20.344 --> 00:37:25.241
to turn away from someone
who may be beyond grace?

722
00:37:26.896 --> 00:37:31.448
No. I think that we all
only have so much capacity

723
00:37:31.482 --> 00:37:33.000
for love and forgiveness.

724
00:37:34.172 --> 00:37:35.862
but it's up to each and
every one of us to decide

725
00:37:35.896 --> 00:37:36.896
what our limits are.

726
00:37:38.965 --> 00:37:41.758
But hey. it's kind of
meaning for new hope.

727
00:37:41.793 --> 00:37:42.758
if you think about.

728
00:37:44.241 --> 00:37:46.413
that hopefully we'll be
able to show each other

729
00:37:46.448 --> 00:37:51.448
the same empathy and grace that
we all want God to show us.

730
00:37:51.862 --> 00:37:55.103
[officer] May we have your
attention. please?

731
00:37:55.965 --> 00:37:57.931
It's six o'clock.

732
00:37:57.965 --> 00:38:01.275
We'd like to encourage
y'all to head home.

733
00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:03.793
in order to abide by
the seven o'clock curfew.

734
00:38:04.965 --> 00:38:08.103
Excuse me. they're still
having choir practice.

735
00:38:09.103 --> 00:38:12.655
And the curfew is seven o'clock.

736
00:38:12.689 --> 00:38:14.689
And how do you plan
on enforcing that?

737
00:38:15.931 --> 00:38:18.655
This is a church plus
it's private property.

738
00:38:18.689 --> 00:38:20.482
Well. private property.
that's partially owned

739
00:38:20.517 --> 00:38:21.344
by mayor Bird.

740
00:38:22.344 --> 00:38:24.137
-What?
-That's crazy.

741
00:38:24.172 --> 00:38:26.586
Levi owns his church and he
would have told me about that.

742
00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:29.586
Sir. I don't actually care.

743
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.379
Now. the curfew will be
enforced all over the city.

744
00:38:35.275 --> 00:38:36.448
You could abide by it.

745
00:38:36.482 --> 00:38:37.655
You mean obey it.

746
00:38:41.344 --> 00:38:43.517
Or you can face
the consequences.

747
00:38:45.275 --> 00:38:48.655
Okay. let's just
send everyone home.

748
00:38:48.689 --> 00:38:50.241
while we get things sorted out.

749
00:38:51.724 --> 00:38:53.310
You should listen to the lady.

750
00:38:54.034 --> 00:38:55.344
[Pastor] Hmm.

751
00:38:55.379 --> 00:38:57.241
All of a sudden I've gone deaf.

752
00:38:59.793 --> 00:39:00.931
Have a blessed day.

753
00:39:20.206 --> 00:39:21.206
Let's go. man.

754
00:39:26.689 --> 00:39:28.137
You forget something Charlie?

755
00:39:32.275 --> 00:39:33.103
Leona.

756
00:39:35.827 --> 00:39:37.448
What is this all about?

757
00:39:37.482 --> 00:39:38.827
Good evening Rex.

758
00:39:38.862 --> 00:39:40.620
Leona. what are you doing here?

759
00:39:40.655 --> 00:39:43.896
My faith officers are here
to execute the curfew.

760
00:39:45.103 --> 00:39:47.931
It's after seven. you
should be home by now.

761
00:39:47.965 --> 00:39:48.793
Really?

762
00:39:49.724 --> 00:39:51.241
You're crazy Leona.

763
00:39:51.275 --> 00:39:52.206
Am I?

764
00:39:53.724 --> 00:39:56.758
You seem to be confused about
the rules that have been set.

765
00:39:56.793 --> 00:39:59.137
or maybe you think they
don't apply to you.

766
00:40:00.793 --> 00:40:02.827
I don't know what you're
trying to pull Leona.

767
00:40:04.586 --> 00:40:05.793
but you and your little birds

768
00:40:05.827 --> 00:40:07.103
need to get off
my damn property.

769
00:40:09.827 --> 00:40:14.793
As mayor. I've instituted
a new tithing structure.

770
00:40:15.034 --> 00:40:19.172
All businesses of Cyprus
will need to tithe a portion

771
00:40:19.206 --> 00:40:22.965
of their profits to New
Hope Baptist Church.

772
00:40:24.551 --> 00:40:26.034
Well. I'm not tithing a cent.

773
00:40:27.172 --> 00:40:28.758
'cause you're a crazy-ass bitch.

774
00:40:28.793 --> 00:40:30.482
Careful Rex.

775
00:40:30.517 --> 00:40:34.172
What's in it for
you. Leona. huh?

776
00:40:34.206 --> 00:40:35.827
'Cause Levi owns New Hope.

777
00:40:37.103 --> 00:40:39.413
He's your new little boy toy.

778
00:40:40.206 --> 00:40:41.344
are you lining his pockets?

779
00:40:41.379 --> 00:40:43.724
I own half of New Hope.

780
00:40:43.758 --> 00:40:45.137
See that's it right there.

781
00:40:46.827 --> 00:40:48.896
This little shakedown you're
doing is all about you

782
00:40:48.931 --> 00:40:50.586
lining your pockets.

783
00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:52.551
Well as owner of New Hope.

784
00:40:52.586 --> 00:40:57.551
I will be ensuring that the
tithes go to godly pursuits

785
00:40:58.448 --> 00:41:00.344
that will help the
people of Cyprus.

786
00:41:00.379 --> 00:41:03.275
Now. it's time
for you to pay up.

787
00:41:05.241 --> 00:41:06.310
You're so full of it.

788
00:41:06.344 --> 00:41:07.724
don't put your hands on me.

789
00:41:13.758 --> 00:41:15.000
Thank you Rex.

790
00:41:15.034 --> 00:41:17.896
Leona. I swear to God.

791
00:41:17.931 --> 00:41:19.551
I'm going to take your ass down.

792
00:41:19.586 --> 00:41:21.068
I still got the journals Leona

793
00:41:21.103 --> 00:41:23.241
and I'm gonna tell the whole
world all your secrets.

794
00:41:23.275 --> 00:41:24.448
you hear me?

795
00:41:24.482 --> 00:41:27.482
You can try. I won't
lose any sleep over it.

796
00:41:28.965 --> 00:41:32.689
Hmm. but Kendrick might.

797
00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:35.137
Kendrick?

798
00:41:35.172 --> 00:41:36.206
Where's Kendrick Leona?

799
00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:39.103
Get home safe Rex.

800
00:41:39.137 --> 00:41:41.344
Leona you know
where Kendrick is.

801
00:41:53.034 --> 00:41:56.275
-[cell phone ringing]
-Crazy bitch.

802
00:42:01.655 --> 00:42:02.413
Hello?

803
00:42:03.517 --> 00:42:05.344
[whispering] Rex. Rex it's me.
don't hang up.

804
00:42:05.379 --> 00:42:06.310
Ella?

805
00:42:06.344 --> 00:42:08.068
I need your help.
Leona she set me up

806
00:42:08.103 --> 00:42:09.931
for Malik's murder. she
got me locked away in here.

807
00:42:09.965 --> 00:42:12.827
No. lawyers. no phone
calls. no nothing.

808
00:42:13.793 --> 00:42:15.000
Did Kendrick get out yet?

809
00:42:15.034 --> 00:42:15.931
Kendrick?

810
00:42:15.965 --> 00:42:17.103
She arrested Kendrick?

811
00:42:17.517 --> 00:42:19.620
Yeah. right in front of me.

812
00:42:19.655 --> 00:42:21.275
Oh you didn't know?

813
00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:22.482
No.

814
00:42:22.517 --> 00:42:24.448
Look. Rex I need you
to get me out of here.

815
00:42:24.482 --> 00:42:26.137
there's no telling
what Leona will do.

816
00:42:26.172 --> 00:42:29.413
Don't worry. trust me all right?

817
00:42:31.172 --> 00:42:34.413
Rex. Rex don't hang
up. wait.

818
00:42:35.103 --> 00:42:36.068
-[phone shutting]
-Damn it.

819
00:42:42.827 --> 00:42:45.896
Stacia. I know
where Kendrick is.

820
00:42:49.482 --> 00:42:50.689
I'm Stacia Cunningham

821
00:42:50.724 --> 00:42:53.137
and I demand to see my
client Kendrick Murphy.

822
00:42:55.862 --> 00:42:57.965
[computer keys clacking]

823
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.379
Oh. there's no record of a
Kendrick Murphy here. ma'am.

824
00:43:01.413 --> 00:43:04.103
Also it's after curfew.
you're suppose to be home. so.

825
00:43:05.206 --> 00:43:06.172
Timmins?

826
00:43:06.206 --> 00:43:07.482
That's my name.

827
00:43:07.517 --> 00:43:11.034
Timmins. you are denying
my client due process.

828
00:43:11.068 --> 00:43:15.551
Now I know he's here. you
will bring him to me now

829
00:43:15.586 --> 00:43:19.724
or I will sue this entire
department. beginning with you.

830
00:43:25.172 --> 00:43:27.344
Let me see what I can
do ma'am. follow me.

831
00:43:39.827 --> 00:43:41.344
Finally. Kendrick-

832
00:43:42.862 --> 00:43:45.517
Stacia. it's good to see you.

833
00:43:45.551 --> 00:43:47.310
Where's Kendrick?

834
00:43:47.344 --> 00:43:50.068
I know you have him locked
away somewhere in here.

835
00:43:50.103 --> 00:43:52.344
you haven't even charged
him with anything.

836
00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:55.758
This? This is an abuse of power.
You will release Kendrick

837
00:43:55.793 --> 00:43:57.862
into my custody right now.

838
00:43:57.896 --> 00:44:01.482
My goodness. I never
realized Kendrick

839
00:44:01.517 --> 00:44:03.448
inspired such passion.

840
00:44:03.482 --> 00:44:04.827
Now Leona.

841
00:44:04.862 --> 00:44:07.068
Kendrick will be
released when I see fit

842
00:44:07.103 --> 00:44:09.206
and not one moment before.

843
00:44:09.241 --> 00:44:10.448
You can't do that.

844
00:44:10.482 --> 00:44:13.206
Oh I can and I can
do so much more.

845
00:44:14.793 --> 00:44:17.586
Then you will be
facing a lawsuit

846
00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:22.586
and when I'm done. Kendrick
will own this entire city.

847
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.586
Well. I don't know about that.

848
00:44:26.379 --> 00:44:28.931
I'm sure Kendrick would
appreciate all this fierce

849
00:44:28.965 --> 00:44:31.586
loyalty you're exhibiting.

850
00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:34.551
but I wonder how
grateful he would be.

851
00:44:34.586 --> 00:44:37.206
when he finds out you've
been lying to him.

852
00:44:38.655 --> 00:44:41.344
about him being the father
of your unborn child.

853
00:44:42.310 --> 00:44:43.793
-What?
-[Leona chuckling]

854
00:44:43.827 --> 00:44:46.137
Stacia. you should know by now

855
00:44:46.172 --> 00:44:48.551
I always do my due diligence.

856
00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:53.689
You and Kendrick were both
recently hospitalized.

857
00:44:54.827 --> 00:44:58.241
it didn't take
much poking around

858
00:44:58.275 --> 00:45:01.206
for me to get my hands
on your medical records.

859
00:45:01.241 --> 00:45:04.758
Just take me to him and I
will tell him the truth.

860
00:45:04.793 --> 00:45:08.344
Well you could. if you had
any proof. he was even here.

861
00:45:08.379 --> 00:45:09.896
[laughing]

862
00:45:09.931 --> 00:45:11.896
Kendrick is off the books.

863
00:45:11.931 --> 00:45:13.793
I will file a complaint. Leona.

864
00:45:13.827 --> 00:45:17.448
Oh. filing your nails would
be a better use of your time.

865
00:45:17.482 --> 00:45:20.000
By the time you get through
all of that legal red tape.

866
00:45:20.034 --> 00:45:22.413
who knows where
Kendrick will be.

867
00:45:22.448 --> 00:45:24.931
or what condition he'll be in.

868
00:45:26.586 --> 00:45:28.586
I'm not going to
let you hurt him.

869
00:45:29.965 --> 00:45:31.551
Well. that's entirely up to you.

870
00:45:34.068 --> 00:45:37.000
Here's how this
is going to work.

871
00:45:37.034 --> 00:45:42.000
You're going to leave Kendrick
right where he is for now.

872
00:45:43.172 --> 00:45:46.517
safe and sound and.
in the meantime.

873
00:45:46.551 --> 00:45:51.448
you're going to do me
a very personal favor.

874
00:46:00.793 --> 00:46:03.793
Hey Stacia. what's going on?

875
00:46:03.827 --> 00:46:04.896
Were you able to get him?

876
00:46:04.931 --> 00:46:06.172
I couldn't get him out.

877
00:46:06.206 --> 00:46:07.689
I couldn't even get in
to him to see him.

878
00:46:07.724 --> 00:46:10.172
I can't even confirm that
he's being held in custody.

879
00:46:10.206 --> 00:46:13.689
Damn. all right
listen. sit tight.

880
00:46:13.724 --> 00:46:15.724
I'm gonna have to
handle this myself.

881
00:46:15.758 --> 00:46:16.586
Okay.

882
00:46:19.482 --> 00:46:21.000
[cell door buzzing and slamming]

883
00:46:22.793 --> 00:46:24.482
Johnson. get up.

884
00:46:24.517 --> 00:46:25.931
What is my lawyer here?

885
00:46:25.965 --> 00:46:26.793
Am I getting out?

886
00:46:26.827 --> 00:46:28.068
Come on. follow me.

887
00:46:28.103 --> 00:46:29.965
What's going on?

888
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:30.965
Where are you taking me?

889
00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:38.793
Do I have a visitor.
what's going on?

890
00:46:40.517 --> 00:46:43.068
When I say go. you're going
straight for that door.

891
00:46:43.103 --> 00:46:44.793
Don't stop. you understand?

892
00:46:44.827 --> 00:46:48.172
Who sent you?

893
00:46:48.206 --> 00:46:49.000
Go.

894
00:46:52.103 --> 00:46:54.862
[siren whirring]

895
00:47:07.931 --> 00:47:09.482
Ella Mae. get in.

896
00:47:11.103 --> 00:47:12.379
Come on.

897
00:47:12.413 --> 00:47:13.724
Rex. you came.

898
00:47:20.827 --> 00:47:22.655
You sold the church to Leona.

899
00:47:22.689 --> 00:47:24.551
I'm not getting into
this with you. Christie.

900
00:47:24.586 --> 00:47:27.241
You are such a hypocrite.

901
00:47:27.275 --> 00:47:29.517
You wanted me to send
my own mother to prison

902
00:47:29.551 --> 00:47:33.586
and here you are doing deals
with that monster. like Leona?

903
00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:35.724
How much did she pay you Levi?

904
00:47:35.758 --> 00:47:36.655
Was it worth it?

905
00:47:36.689 --> 00:47:37.517
It might be.

906
00:47:38.758 --> 00:47:41.068
Leona promised to make
me fully mobile again.

907
00:47:41.103 --> 00:47:44.724
if I sold her the church.
so no more of this.

908
00:47:44.758 --> 00:47:46.137
full use of my body.

909
00:47:46.172 --> 00:47:49.172
She can't promise you that Levi.

910
00:47:49.206 --> 00:47:50.655
She's not a doctor.

911
00:47:50.689 --> 00:47:54.103
Maybe she can and maybe
it's worth it for me to try.

912
00:47:55.103 --> 00:47:56.620
So I can try to be whole again.

913
00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:05.103
Levi. you are not broken.

914
00:48:06.379 --> 00:48:07.413
you are whole.

915
00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:09.448
You can't say that.

916
00:48:11.965 --> 00:48:13.448
You don't know what it's like.

917
00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:16.965
you don't know what I lost.

918
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.827
did you know I had to
learn how to walk again

919
00:48:18.862 --> 00:48:20.586
after they shot me?

920
00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:23.586
Or did you know that
I'm always in pain?

921
00:48:25.206 --> 00:48:28.000
I'm so sorry. I
didn't know that.

922
00:48:29.689 --> 00:48:31.551
Then you can't say
it's not worth it.

923
00:48:38.448 --> 00:48:40.137
Levi. I get it.

924
00:48:40.172 --> 00:48:43.103
I understand why
you want to do this.

925
00:48:44.068 --> 00:48:46.241
but you can't trust Leona.

926
00:48:48.379 --> 00:48:49.275
Please. Levi.

927
00:48:51.793 --> 00:48:53.241
So why don't you
break me out huh?

928
00:48:53.275 --> 00:48:55.241
I mean. why are you
trying to help me?

929
00:48:56.896 --> 00:48:58.172
It's not about you. Ella.

930
00:48:59.103 --> 00:49:00.724
It's about Leona.

931
00:49:00.758 --> 00:49:02.413
We got to shut her down.

932
00:49:02.448 --> 00:49:06.379
I guess I didn't realize
just how twisted she is.

933
00:49:06.413 --> 00:49:11.344
to set your own daughter
up for murder. She's sick.

934
00:49:11.379 --> 00:49:13.482
and to think that
you were with her.

935
00:49:13.517 --> 00:49:15.724
don't try to act like you
didn't sleep with her.

936
00:49:15.758 --> 00:49:17.689
That was a long time ago. Ella

937
00:49:17.724 --> 00:49:20.103
and after I laid eyes on you.

938
00:49:20.137 --> 00:49:21.896
I never touched
her again. I swear.

939
00:49:23.172 --> 00:49:25.862
Now listen. Kendrick
is still locked up.

940
00:49:25.896 --> 00:49:29.068
he's off the grid. there's no
telling what Leona did to him.

941
00:49:31.310 --> 00:49:33.000
You know what's sad?

942
00:49:33.034 --> 00:49:34.758
He's still paying
for our mistakes.

943
00:49:35.724 --> 00:49:39.931
Yeah Rex. we gotta stop her.

944
00:49:40.413 --> 00:49:41.379
[gun clacks]

945
00:49:42.034 --> 00:49:45.068
[telephone ringing]

946
00:49:45.655 --> 00:49:47.931
[mysterious music]

947
00:49:47.965 --> 00:49:49.344
[call silenced]

948
00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:53.206
-[door opening]
-Mr. Sterling.

949
00:49:54.413 --> 00:49:55.586
I'm excited to meet you.

950
00:50:05.517 --> 00:50:07.586
You sure this is safe?

951
00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:09.379
It is experimental.

952
00:50:09.413 --> 00:50:12.655
There are always risks. but
I've had major successes.

953
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.275
Now. Mr. Sterling.
it's imperative

954
00:50:15.310 --> 00:50:18.103
that our interaction
remains discreet.

955
00:50:18.137 --> 00:50:19.586
Full disclosure.
only met with you

956
00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:20.931
based on who referred you.

957
00:50:21.655 --> 00:50:23.758
but I will say you're an
extremely promising candidate

958
00:50:23.793 --> 00:50:24.931
for this drug protocol.

959
00:50:26.310 --> 00:50:27.586
What if it doesn't work?

960
00:50:30.310 --> 00:50:31.689
Every patient's different.

961
00:50:32.827 --> 00:50:34.793
but focus on what could
happen if it does.

962
00:50:37.448 --> 00:50:38.586
I'll see you soon.

963
00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:50.448
Leona?

964
00:50:52.034 --> 00:50:55.344
You've gotten what you wanted.
you need to let me go now.

965
00:50:55.379 --> 00:50:57.517
Willie. I'm so disappointed

966
00:50:57.551 --> 00:50:59.241
that you seem so
anxious to leave.

967
00:50:59.275 --> 00:51:01.655
it was starting to
feel like old times.

968
00:51:01.689 --> 00:51:04.827
Leona please. I've got
important work to do.

969
00:51:04.862 --> 00:51:06.103
I need to get back now.

970
00:51:06.137 --> 00:51:08.275
Oh. I know exactly
what work you're doing.

971
00:51:11.310 --> 00:51:12.517
I can explain.

972
00:51:12.551 --> 00:51:15.482
Oh. it's all very
interesting. actually.

973
00:51:15.517 --> 00:51:19.655
but you didn't really think
I was going to just let you

974
00:51:19.689 --> 00:51:22.655
waltz back into your new life.

975
00:51:22.689 --> 00:51:24.344
after the way you betrayed me?

976
00:51:24.379 --> 00:51:27.206
Please. you have to understand.

977
00:51:27.241 --> 00:51:28.241
I was just--

978
00:51:28.275 --> 00:51:31.103
Saving yourself at
what cost to me?

979
00:51:31.137 --> 00:51:34.517
My freedom. my reputation.

980
00:51:34.551 --> 00:51:39.517
Leona please. I've given
you all I can. please.

981
00:51:40.413 --> 00:51:42.068
please I'm sorry.

982
00:51:42.103 --> 00:51:42.931
Forgive me?

983
00:51:47.689 --> 00:51:49.034
No.

984
00:51:49.482 --> 00:51:50.655
Take her.

985
00:51:50.689 --> 00:51:52.793
No Leona. Leona. please.

986
00:51:53.034 --> 00:51:56.068
Leona! Leona.
please. Please. Leona!

987
00:51:56.655 --> 00:51:59.034
Please! Leona. please!

988
00:52:00.103 --> 00:52:03.379
As the curfew continues.
some citizens have concerns

989
00:52:03.413 --> 00:52:06.689
that the mayor may be
capitalizing on her authority.

990
00:52:08.137 --> 00:52:10.827
Good evening.
citizens of Cyprus.

991
00:52:10.862 --> 00:52:12.241
What? Rex get in here.

992
00:52:12.275 --> 00:52:14.275
As the mayor of our great city.

993
00:52:14.310 --> 00:52:16.310
I know your fears.

994
00:52:17.758 --> 00:52:22.206
That's why I offer a
strong hand. guided by God

995
00:52:22.241 --> 00:52:23.655
to lead us through them.

996
00:52:24.793 --> 00:52:27.827
It will take the
collective sacrifice.

997
00:52:27.862 --> 00:52:32.827
of Cypress' citizens to lead
us to the promised land.

998
00:52:33.310 --> 00:52:37.482
It gives me no pleasure to
announce that my daughter.

999
00:52:37.517 --> 00:52:42.482
Ella Johnson. has escaped
from police custody.

1000
00:52:43.689 --> 00:52:46.896
The long and merciful
arm of justice requires.

1001
00:52:46.931 --> 00:52:51.724
that she face the consequences
of her alleged crimes.

1002
00:52:53.137 --> 00:52:58.103
Ella Mae. I as a righteous
servant of Cyprus.

1003
00:52:59.068 --> 00:53:02.275
implore you to turn yourself in.

1004
00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:04.103
That bitch is crazy.

1005
00:53:04.137 --> 00:53:06.448
I would also like to announce.

1006
00:53:06.482 --> 00:53:08.862
that we are
intensifying the search

1007
00:53:08.896 --> 00:53:13.862
for our missing girls.
As such I have instituted

1008
00:53:14.103 --> 00:53:18.137
a new protocol of random
search and seizure.

1009
00:53:18.172 --> 00:53:19.379
What in the hell?

1010
00:53:19.413 --> 00:53:23.379
I encourage all citizens
of Cyprus to cooperate

1011
00:53:23.413 --> 00:53:27.344
with our committed and
gracious faith officers.

1012
00:53:27.379 --> 00:53:31.413
as they do the work
of finding our girls.

1013
00:53:31.448 --> 00:53:34.758
We will find our girls.

1014
00:53:35.965 --> 00:53:39.103
Have faith in the process.

1015
00:53:39.137 --> 00:53:41.862
have faith in me.

1016
00:53:41.896 --> 00:53:44.413
Thank you and have
a blessed day.

Yes. I need an ambulance.

[loud groaning]

1039
00:56:10.793 --> 00:56:11.517
Yeah.

1040
00:56:11.793 --> 00:56:13.000
So what did he say?

1041
00:56:14.379 --> 00:56:17.137
He said Leona has
Kendrick on deep lockdown.

1042
00:56:17.172 --> 00:56:18.724
We can't get to him?

1043
00:56:18.758 --> 00:56:20.931
No. we can't break him out.

1044
00:56:20.965 --> 00:56:22.137
But he hasn't been
charged for anything.

1045
00:56:22.172 --> 00:56:24.068
I mean. she can't
hold him indefinitely.

1046
00:56:24.103 --> 00:56:26.310
Station said he's not
even in the system.

1047
00:56:26.344 --> 00:56:29.379
So basically Leona has
created her own shadow prison.

1048
00:56:29.413 --> 00:56:31.413
Yeah. she's locking
up all her enemies

1049
00:56:31.448 --> 00:56:32.620
and throwing away the key.

1050
00:56:32.655 --> 00:56:34.620
Rex the only way we're
gonna get him out.

1051
00:56:34.655 --> 00:56:36.482
is we gotta take her down.

1052
00:56:36.517 --> 00:56:40.827
I agree and that's
why you're here.

1053
00:56:40.862 --> 00:56:42.034
What?

1054
00:56:42.068 --> 00:56:43.379
Listen to me. you're
the real mayor.

1055
00:56:44.551 --> 00:56:46.275
You know the system
inside and out.

1056
00:56:47.482 --> 00:56:48.862
So what's your next move?

1057
00:56:48.896 --> 00:56:51.931
'Cause if it was up
to me. I'd handle it

1058
00:56:51.965 --> 00:56:53.241
the old fashioned way.

1059
00:57:12.724 --> 00:57:15.344
Nurse. are there any
updates with his status?

1060
00:57:15.379 --> 00:57:17.344
He's stable. the
seizures have stopped.

1061
00:57:17.379 --> 00:57:19.793
He should regain
consciousness soon.

1062
00:57:19.827 --> 00:57:21.241
Thank God.

1063
00:57:21.275 --> 00:57:23.586
It's good you got
him in when he did.

1064
00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:25.241
you may have just
saved his life.

1065
00:57:29.896 --> 00:57:32.241
And Leona almost ended it.

1066
00:57:46.413 --> 00:57:48.379
You gotta lay low.
Ella. be cool.

1067
00:57:48.413 --> 00:57:49.551
They looking for you.

1068
00:57:49.827 --> 00:57:51.413
Yeah well. maybe
you should just take

1069
00:57:51.448 --> 00:57:53.137
some of the side streets.

1070
00:57:53.172 --> 00:57:54.689
you know it's past curfew.

1071
00:57:54.724 --> 00:57:57.793
The last thing we need is
for you to be pulled over

1072
00:57:57.827 --> 00:57:59.965
by one of them damn bird men.

1073
00:58:00.793 --> 00:58:03.137
[chuckling]

1074
00:58:03.172 --> 00:58:07.620
Yeah well. you ain't
gotta worry about them.

1075
00:58:07.655 --> 00:58:09.137
because they're gonna
be distracted now.

1076
00:58:11.172 --> 00:58:13.724
Mother. what have you done?

1077
00:58:18.034 --> 00:58:19.206
[Rex] Damn.

1078
00:58:19.827 --> 00:58:22.965
[rapid knocking]

1079
00:58:26.655 --> 00:58:28.310
Ella. what are you doing here?

1080
00:58:28.344 --> 00:58:30.034
You know. there's a warrant
out for your arrest.

1081
00:58:30.068 --> 00:58:31.448
I know. that's why I'm
here. now let us in

1082
00:58:31.482 --> 00:58:32.655
we gotta talk.

1083
00:58:32.689 --> 00:58:34.448
No. if Leona finds
out. there's no telling

1084
00:58:34.482 --> 00:58:35.517
what she'll do.

1085
00:58:35.551 --> 00:58:37.275
Kimberly look around.
she's already doing it.

1086
00:58:37.310 --> 00:58:40.172
Cypress is in chaos and
you gave her the power.

1087
00:58:40.206 --> 00:58:43.034
which we both know that means
she has something on you.

1088
00:58:43.068 --> 00:58:46.448
Listen to me. Kimberly.
this has got to stop now.

1089
00:58:46.482 --> 00:58:48.551
now I don't know what it
is that Leona has on you.

1090
00:58:48.586 --> 00:58:51.206
but it can't be worth
this. now let us in.

1091
00:58:51.241 --> 00:58:52.034
Move.

1092
00:58:58.517 --> 00:59:00.931
[footsteps approaching]

1093
00:59:03.206 --> 00:59:06.551
Move out of my way. I need
to speak to my grandmother.

1094
00:59:06.586 --> 00:59:09.000
Let her in. she's harmless.

1095
00:59:10.551 --> 00:59:11.379
You can go.

1096
00:59:16.517 --> 00:59:18.379
You could have killed him.

1097
00:59:18.413 --> 00:59:19.344
Who?

1098
00:59:19.379 --> 00:59:20.724
Levi.

1099
00:59:20.758 --> 00:59:22.206
With whatever that drug was

1100
00:59:22.241 --> 00:59:24.793
you had that whack
job doctor prescribe.

1101
00:59:25.482 --> 00:59:29.000
I assure you that. while
he's somewhat unorthodox.

1102
00:59:29.034 --> 00:59:30.620
he's no whack job.

1103
00:59:30.655 --> 00:59:32.103
Levi's in the hospital.

1104
00:59:32.137 --> 00:59:34.482
And what does that
have to do with me?

1105
00:59:34.517 --> 00:59:36.275
You lied to him.

1106
00:59:36.310 --> 00:59:38.241
You made him believe
that you could fix him.

1107
00:59:38.275 --> 00:59:40.034
that you could somehow heal him.

1108
00:59:40.068 --> 00:59:44.000
Nope. I offered
Levi an opportunity.

1109
00:59:44.034 --> 00:59:45.482
He chose to take it.

1110
00:59:47.068 --> 00:59:48.586
You are disgusting.

1111
00:59:51.275 --> 00:59:54.758
And you are such
a disappointment.

1112
00:59:56.862 --> 00:59:59.620
You had so much potential.

1113
00:59:59.655 --> 01:00:03.655
Every opportunity.
Daughter of a pastor.

1114
01:00:03.689 --> 01:00:07.034
beautiful education. a doctor

1115
01:00:07.068 --> 01:00:08.965
and you squandered all of it.

1116
01:00:09.758 --> 01:00:14.068
Now. you're an ex-convict
following your brother.

1117
01:00:14.103 --> 01:00:17.655
and now your mother.
straight into the gutter.

1118
01:00:17.689 --> 01:00:19.000
[tense music]

1119
01:00:19.034 --> 01:00:21.896
You'll never make
anything of yourself.

1120
01:00:21.931 --> 01:00:25.000
All that talent
just wasted.

1121
01:00:26.482 --> 01:00:28.103
Now get out of here.

1122
01:00:30.689 --> 01:00:32.758
Be lucky I don't
have you thrown back

1123
01:00:32.793 --> 01:00:34.482
in a cell where you belong.

1124
01:00:39.241 --> 01:00:40.344
You're dismissed.

1125
01:01:00.793 --> 01:01:03.793
Nurse. where's the
patient Levi Sterling?

1126
01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:05.689
He was stable when I left.

1127
01:01:05.724 --> 01:01:08.379
Yes. as far as I know
that hasn't changed.

1128
01:01:08.413 --> 01:01:10.482
So where is he?

1129
01:01:10.517 --> 01:01:12.344
Ma'am he was transferred.

1130
01:01:12.379 --> 01:01:13.482
Where?

1131
01:01:16.103 --> 01:01:20.448
Listen. I'm his friend
and I'm a doctor.

1132
01:01:20.482 --> 01:01:21.655
I used to work here.

1133
01:01:21.689 --> 01:01:24.000
Then. you know the
rules on patient care.

1134
01:01:24.034 --> 01:01:27.034
Please. I need to know where
my friend was transferred.

1135
01:01:31.103 --> 01:01:32.793
It's a private medical facility.

1136
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.137
So then it's settled?

1137
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.068
Great. send me the confirmation

1138
01:01:45.103 --> 01:01:47.586
and it's important that
this remains confidential.

1139
01:01:50.965 --> 01:01:51.793
Thank you.

1140
01:01:56.482 --> 01:01:58.724
Please forgive me Kendrick.

1141
01:02:05.896 --> 01:02:06.827
[door buzzing]

1142
01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:18.310
You think God hears you?

1143
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.586
I know he does. that's
why I'm still alive.

1144
01:02:27.862 --> 01:02:30.448
You might say that's
because I allowed it.

1145
01:02:31.344 --> 01:02:32.517
I could have smothered you

1146
01:02:32.551 --> 01:02:35.379
in your hospital bed
the last time we spoke.

1147
01:02:38.724 --> 01:02:39.793
But you didn't.

1148
01:02:41.793 --> 01:02:43.517
And I think about that often.

1149
01:02:44.827 --> 01:02:47.275
Why do I keep letting you live?

1150
01:02:49.413 --> 01:02:50.344
It's not you.

1151
01:02:51.103 --> 01:02:52.172
Oh?

1152
01:02:52.206 --> 01:02:54.931
God has a plan for me
and I truly believe that.

1153
01:02:54.965 --> 01:02:57.000
Well he has an interesting way

1154
01:02:57.034 --> 01:02:59.172
of showing his benevolence.

1155
01:03:00.448 --> 01:03:04.344
because here you
are at mymercy.

1156
01:03:04.379 --> 01:03:08.448
Listen Leona. if you wanted
to kill me up in here

1157
01:03:08.482 --> 01:03:10.000
you would have done it already.

1158
01:03:10.034 --> 01:03:11.379
Perhaps.

1159
01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:14.620
I keep thinking about that.

1160
01:03:16.103 --> 01:03:20.586
Maybe I do get some pleasure
out of keeping you around.

1161
01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:22.689
[laughing] It's comical really.

1162
01:03:22.724 --> 01:03:25.862
You're like a cartoon
character that won't stay dead.

1163
01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:30.793
I bury you alive.
poison you. Oh.

1164
01:03:30.827 --> 01:03:34.655
and there's a car crash.

1165
01:03:34.931 --> 01:03:36.275
And yet. here you are.

1166
01:03:38.517 --> 01:03:40.137
Like I said. it's not you.

1167
01:03:41.896 --> 01:03:44.000
Godhas a purpose for me.

1168
01:03:46.344 --> 01:03:48.413
[Leona laughing] What? To
entertain me?

1169
01:03:49.310 --> 01:03:50.931
Read the room. Kendrick.

1170
01:03:52.344 --> 01:03:54.482
I have all the power here.

1171
01:03:54.517 --> 01:03:56.344
What do you want Leona?

1172
01:03:56.379 --> 01:03:59.275
Well. you had the right
idea for once Kendrick.

1173
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.344
It's time for us to pray.

1174
01:04:04.655 --> 01:04:07.310
It's time for us to go to God.

1175
01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:18.517
Hi. I'm looking
for Levi Sterling.

1176
01:04:25.448 --> 01:04:28.241
I'm sorry. we don't have
anyone by that name here.

1177
01:04:28.275 --> 01:04:32.137
He's here. he was just
transferred from Cyprus General.

1178
01:04:33.379 --> 01:04:35.758
But we don't have him
on record sorry ma'am.

1179
01:04:35.793 --> 01:04:37.517
Listen. I don't
need your apology.

1180
01:04:37.551 --> 01:04:41.241
I need you to tell me
where Levi is. okay?

1181
01:04:41.275 --> 01:04:42.758
The told me he was
transferred here.

1182
01:04:42.793 --> 01:04:44.586
-Hey. hey calm down please.
-I know he's here.

1183
01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:47.103
Miss. pardon me. Excuse me.
ma'am I'm Dr. Ross.

1184
01:04:47.137 --> 01:04:49.000
I can take you to see
Mr. Sterling. miss...

1185
01:04:49.034 --> 01:04:51.448
Christie. Johnson.

1186
01:04:51.482 --> 01:04:53.344
Dr. Ross?

1187
01:04:53.379 --> 01:04:54.862
Are you the one that's
been treating him?

1188
01:04:54.896 --> 01:04:56.965
Did you give him those drugs?

1189
01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.034
Ma'am listen. I
understand your concern.

1190
01:05:00.068 --> 01:05:01.310
Let me take you to see Levi.

1191
01:05:01.344 --> 01:05:03.068
No. no. no. you
could've killed him.

1192
01:05:03.103 --> 01:05:05.551
He believed in you after you
made him all those promises.

1193
01:05:05.586 --> 01:05:08.758
Hold on now. I never
promised Levi anything.

1194
01:05:08.793 --> 01:05:10.758
Listen. you're a
doctor. you understand

1195
01:05:10.793 --> 01:05:12.344
that patients take
informed risks

1196
01:05:12.379 --> 01:05:13.344
when it comes to the treatment.

1197
01:05:13.379 --> 01:05:16.448
Wait. how did you
know I was a doctor?

1198
01:05:16.482 --> 01:05:17.862
Mr. Sterling mentioned it.

1199
01:05:20.275 --> 01:05:21.689
Come on. come with me.

1200
01:05:26.586 --> 01:05:27.965
How is he?

1201
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.862
What's his status?

1202
01:05:29.896 --> 01:05:32.482
How's he responding
to treatment?

1203
01:05:32.517 --> 01:05:33.448
See for yourself?

1204
01:05:39.965 --> 01:05:40.793
Levi?

1205
01:05:42.448 --> 01:05:44.379
I'm back. I'm back.

1206
01:05:45.517 --> 01:05:46.689
Oh my God.

1207
01:05:46.724 --> 01:05:47.448
I'm back!

1208
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.379
Oh my God.

1209
01:05:51.689 --> 01:05:53.000
You're okay.

1210
01:05:53.034 --> 01:05:56.275
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1211
01:05:57.517 --> 01:06:00.137
[gentle music]

1212
01:06:05.931 --> 01:06:07.172
I'm okay.

1213
01:06:07.758 --> 01:06:09.137
You're okay.

1214
01:06:11.275 --> 01:06:13.827
[gentle music]

1215
01:06:27.931 --> 01:06:29.413
You got a miracle. Levi.

1216
01:06:31.482 --> 01:06:36.379
Yeah. kind of feels
like a second chance.

1217
01:06:42.379 --> 01:06:45.793
[siren wailing]

1218
01:06:45.827 --> 01:06:47.103
Is that for you?

1219
01:06:47.137 --> 01:06:49.827
I guess so. but I
wasn't speeding.

1220
01:07:08.482 --> 01:07:09.379
[knocking on window]

1221
01:07:11.206 --> 01:07:13.482
[window whirring down]

1222
01:07:14.724 --> 01:07:16.034
Is there a problem officer?

1223
01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:21.620
It's after curfew.

1224
01:07:22.275 --> 01:07:23.413
What are you doing on the road?

1225
01:07:23.448 --> 01:07:24.310
We just came from the hospital.

1226
01:07:24.344 --> 01:07:25.620
Can I see your ID ma'am?

1227
01:07:27.689 --> 01:07:28.517
Sure.

1228
01:07:52.344 --> 01:07:54.103
Yeah. pulled over a driver

1229
01:07:54.137 --> 01:07:56.000
by the name of Christie Johnson.

1230
01:07:57.758 --> 01:07:58.586
Got it.

1231
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:03.827
Ms. Johnson.

1232
01:08:06.551 --> 01:08:09.551
I'm gonna need you and your
passenger to come with me.

1233
01:08:09.586 --> 01:08:10.482
Excuse me?

1234
01:08:11.310 --> 01:08:12.310
Why?

1235
01:08:12.344 --> 01:08:13.931
Is that going to be a problem?

1236
01:08:14.896 --> 01:08:17.620
No. no. there's no problem.

1237
01:08:17.655 --> 01:08:19.413
but can you just tell us why?

1238
01:08:20.758 --> 01:08:21.965
By order of the mayor.

1239
01:08:25.482 --> 01:08:26.551
Let's not keep her waiting.

1240
01:08:31.862 --> 01:08:33.275
Wait. what are we doing here?

1241
01:08:33.310 --> 01:08:34.862
Yeah I own this church.

1242
01:08:35.862 --> 01:08:37.000
-Kendrick.
-Sis.

1243
01:08:38.344 --> 01:08:43.344
Christie. Levi. it's
good of you to join us.

1244
01:08:43.655 --> 01:08:45.310
It's time for church to begin.

1245
01:08:51.275 --> 01:08:52.413
Good evening. church.

1246
01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.137
I said. good evening church.

1247
01:09:00.137 --> 01:09:02.896
[Group] Good evening.

1248
01:09:02.931 --> 01:09:04.689
Members of the church board.

1249
01:09:06.482 --> 01:09:09.310
the last time I
stood at this pulpit.

1250
01:09:09.344 --> 01:09:11.482
it was very different.

1251
01:09:12.793 --> 01:09:14.931
I was asked to apologize.

1252
01:09:16.241 --> 01:09:17.448
to repent.

1253
01:09:18.689 --> 01:09:20.931
to be compliant.

1254
01:09:22.206 --> 01:09:26.517
I am not interested
in being compliant.

1255
01:09:28.413 --> 01:09:31.206
For decades. I watched
my husband

1256
01:09:31.241 --> 01:09:32.724
give sermon after sermon.

1257
01:09:32.758 --> 01:09:36.517
after sermon and I
watched as all of you.

1258
01:09:36.551 --> 01:09:39.931
and generations before
you. heeded his words.

1259
01:09:39.965 --> 01:09:43.448
his message. as if
it were ordained.

1260
01:09:44.551 --> 01:09:47.103
But what does that mean for me?

1261
01:09:48.827 --> 01:09:51.586
What was asked of me?

1262
01:09:53.482 --> 01:09:55.655
You wanted silence.

1263
01:09:57.482 --> 01:10:01.655
You wanted the dutiful
wife and mother

1264
01:10:01.689 --> 01:10:05.344
and first lady that would kneel

1265
01:10:05.379 --> 01:10:10.344
and supplicate and subjugate
herself and her ambitions.

1266
01:10:10.896 --> 01:10:13.931
I'm not interested.

1267
01:10:13.965 --> 01:10:14.758
Leona.

1268
01:10:14.793 --> 01:10:16.620
Don't interrupt me.

1269
01:10:25.379 --> 01:10:28.137
I know what power
looks like in the hands

1270
01:10:28.172 --> 01:10:32.931
of the weak. men generally.

1271
01:10:32.965 --> 01:10:34.310
who were too foolish

1272
01:10:34.344 --> 01:10:38.413
and easily distracted
to execute their vision.

1273
01:10:38.448 --> 01:10:42.379
But that does not absolve
the women. of course.

1274
01:10:43.896 --> 01:10:47.724
as Christie you veered far
from the path of anything

1275
01:10:47.758 --> 01:10:50.379
that was ever
envisioned for you.

1276
01:10:50.413 --> 01:10:53.241
And we don't have to go into
all of the reasons for that.

1277
01:10:55.862 --> 01:10:58.655
I am not weak.

1278
01:11:01.068 --> 01:11:03.413
I won't falter.

1279
01:11:03.448 --> 01:11:05.482
I will not kneel.

1280
01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:11.586
pastor Green. please
approach the pulpit.

1281
01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:13.862
Leona. this is not okay.

1282
01:11:13.896 --> 01:11:15.137
You must stop this.

1283
01:11:15.172 --> 01:11:19.827
Pastor Green.
approach the pulpit.

1284
01:11:28.931 --> 01:11:30.000
It's okay.

1285
01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:37.655
The last time I stood
here. the congregation.

1286
01:11:37.689 --> 01:11:41.344
your congregation.
they laughed at me.

1287
01:11:42.689 --> 01:11:47.310
A congregation built
over generations. by me.

1288
01:11:49.482 --> 01:11:52.965
They ostracized me.

1289
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.241
They just wanted some
introspection from you.

1290
01:11:55.275 --> 01:11:56.068
a little humility.

1291
01:11:56.103 --> 01:11:57.724
Humility?

1292
01:11:57.758 --> 01:12:00.379
Don't you mean humiliation?

1293
01:12:00.413 --> 01:12:02.655
You want me to be humble?

1294
01:12:04.068 --> 01:12:07.620
Tell me pastor. the
cornerstone that you added

1295
01:12:07.655 --> 01:12:10.000
to New Hope when you rebuilt it.

1296
01:12:10.034 --> 01:12:11.517
whose name is on it?

1297
01:12:11.551 --> 01:12:12.620
Pastor Daniel Burke.

1298
01:12:12.655 --> 01:12:16.000
Right. Not me.

1299
01:12:17.655 --> 01:12:21.827
No mention of my
sacrifice. my work.

1300
01:12:21.862 --> 01:12:23.413
my contribution.

1301
01:12:23.448 --> 01:12:24.448
Leona.

1302
01:12:24.482 --> 01:12:25.310
First lady.

1303
01:12:26.793 --> 01:12:29.379
That's how you will
address me in my church.

1304
01:12:31.172 --> 01:12:33.965
I built this church.
I built this city.

1305
01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.551
You will all give me the
respect that I am due.

1306
01:12:37.586 --> 01:12:39.310
starting with you. Kneel.

1307
01:12:39.862 --> 01:12:41.068
What?

1308
01:12:41.655 --> 01:12:43.413
I said kneel.

1309
01:12:45.586 --> 01:12:47.827
I don't kneel to
anybody but God.

1310
01:12:47.862 --> 01:12:51.137
Oh. but there's a first
time for everything.

1311
01:12:51.172 --> 01:12:53.000
Bring him to his knees.

1312
01:12:53.034 --> 01:12:55.724
Hold on! Wait. no. No!

1313
01:12:55.758 --> 01:12:58.827
Leona. stop. just stop it.

1314
01:12:59.275 --> 01:13:02.862
Ella Mae. Are you here to
repent for your sins.

1315
01:13:02.896 --> 01:13:04.344
or to turn yourself in?

1316
01:13:04.379 --> 01:13:07.137
It's over mother.
let Kendrick go

1317
01:13:07.172 --> 01:13:08.413
and let these people go.

1318
01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:12.586
This is over. when
I say it's over.

1319
01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:15.517
after all. I'm the mayor.

1320
01:13:16.724 --> 01:13:20.137
Not anymore. you've been
impeached as acting mayor.

1321
01:13:20.172 --> 01:13:22.793
by a unanimous vote of the
city council of Cyprus.

1322
01:13:22.827 --> 01:13:25.103
You need to step down Leona.

1323
01:13:25.137 --> 01:13:27.482
effective immediately.

1324
01:13:27.517 --> 01:13:29.896
Does this look like
a democracy to you?

1325
01:13:30.931 --> 01:13:31.931
You know Leona.

1326
01:13:31.965 --> 01:13:33.758
I thought you would say
something like that.

1327
01:13:34.724 --> 01:13:35.551
Now!

1328
01:13:37.482 --> 01:13:40.206
[dramatic music]

1329
01:13:45.482 --> 01:13:48.965
Leona. by order of
the state of Georgia.

1330
01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.310
you need to step down.

1331
01:13:52.586 --> 01:13:55.310
[dramatic music]

1332
01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:02.310
[door buzzing]

1333
01:14:04.206 --> 01:14:06.482
I managed to rescind
your power of attorney.

1334
01:14:06.517 --> 01:14:09.379
you no longer have any
control over my assets.

1335
01:14:09.413 --> 01:14:12.379
Well. thankfully I got what
I needed when I had them.

1336
01:14:12.413 --> 01:14:14.724
Well maybe. but you're
going to need a hell

1337
01:14:14.758 --> 01:14:16.517
of an attorney after
all you've done.

1338
01:14:16.551 --> 01:14:18.310
What did I do exactly?

1339
01:14:18.344 --> 01:14:21.655
You terrorized the
citizens of Cyprus. for one.

1340
01:14:21.689 --> 01:14:23.827
I was the acting mayor.

1341
01:14:23.862 --> 01:14:27.310
I made executive orders
in a state of emergency.

1342
01:14:27.344 --> 01:14:30.724
You had the police break
into the citizens' homes.

1343
01:14:30.758 --> 01:14:33.758
You looted them.
you stole from them.

1344
01:14:33.793 --> 01:14:37.103
No. that was asset forfeiture.

1345
01:14:37.137 --> 01:14:39.827
necessary search and
seizure to find the girls

1346
01:14:39.862 --> 01:14:42.551
that went missing on your watch.

1347
01:14:42.586 --> 01:14:45.206
Yeah well. good luck
proving that to a judge.

1348
01:14:45.241 --> 01:14:46.448
but you know what?

1349
01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:49.000
You're going to go away
for a very long time

1350
01:14:49.034 --> 01:14:52.103
and don't expect to get
out of this one alive.

1351
01:14:52.896 --> 01:14:55.551
[laughing]

1352
01:14:55.586 --> 01:14:58.965
Think Ella Mae. do
you really believe

1353
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.172
that I thought I would have

1354
01:15:01.206 --> 01:15:04.000
a definite reign over
the city of Cyprus?

1355
01:15:05.206 --> 01:15:08.172
I was the actingmayor.

1356
01:15:09.172 --> 01:15:10.689
Of course I understood

1357
01:15:10.724 --> 01:15:13.862
I had a certain window
to accomplish my goals.

1358
01:15:13.896 --> 01:15:14.724
Goals?

1359
01:15:15.551 --> 01:15:17.103
Your goals?

1360
01:15:17.137 --> 01:15:20.413
What were your
goals. Leona? Huh?

1361
01:15:20.448 --> 01:15:21.586
To hurt me?

1362
01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:24.206
Well congratulations. you
did that. you hurt me.

1363
01:15:24.241 --> 01:15:26.172
I should have never trusted you.

1364
01:15:26.206 --> 01:15:28.448
I should have never
believed that my mother.

1365
01:15:29.448 --> 01:15:31.344
would actually try to help me.

1366
01:15:33.068 --> 01:15:37.241
You killed Malik. you
set me up for murder.

1367
01:15:37.275 --> 01:15:38.655
you put him in my pool.

1368
01:15:38.689 --> 01:15:40.827
and then you called
the police. for what?

1369
01:15:40.862 --> 01:15:41.793
For what?

1370
01:15:41.827 --> 01:15:43.310
For them to arrest me?

1371
01:15:43.344 --> 01:15:45.413
What? Sentence me
to life in prison?

1372
01:15:46.724 --> 01:15:49.000
Or kill me. for what?

1373
01:15:49.034 --> 01:15:51.344
[pounding] What were your
goals Leona. huh?

1374
01:15:53.068 --> 01:15:57.586
Do you really hate me that
much. your own daughter?

1375
01:16:00.206 --> 01:16:01.517
Ella Mae. I'm--

1376
01:16:01.551 --> 01:16:02.379
[door buzzing]

1377
01:16:04.655 --> 01:16:06.000
Stacia. what are you doing here?

1378
01:16:09.103 --> 01:16:10.896
I am Leona's attorney.

1379
01:16:10.931 --> 01:16:12.413
What?

1380
01:16:12.448 --> 01:16:15.689
Why would you represent
her after all she's done?

1381
01:16:15.724 --> 01:16:19.172
She threw Kendrick in jail.
he couldn't even get to you.

1382
01:16:19.862 --> 01:16:21.793
I don't know anything
about that. I'm sorry.

1383
01:16:21.827 --> 01:16:24.000
But prior to all of the
alleged occurrences.

1384
01:16:24.034 --> 01:16:26.068
Leona retained me as
her legal counsel.

1385
01:16:26.103 --> 01:16:27.206
For what?

1386
01:16:28.551 --> 01:16:30.655
I obtained Leona's
immunity deal.

1387
01:16:33.655 --> 01:16:35.206
All of her actions
as acting mayor

1388
01:16:35.241 --> 01:16:37.206
have been deemed
inadmissible in court.

1389
01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:40.758
No. no that's not possible.

1390
01:16:40.793 --> 01:16:42.655
because the entire city council.

1391
01:16:42.689 --> 01:16:45.275
they are ready to
testify against her.

1392
01:16:45.310 --> 01:16:46.586
This deal goes up

1393
01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:48.965
before the Georgia State
Supreme Court Justice

1394
01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.344
and Leona is being vouched
for by state Senator Hayes.

1395
01:16:51.379 --> 01:16:53.896
who I believe you're
familiar with.

1396
01:16:53.931 --> 01:16:56.241
Stacia. you know
what she's done.

1397
01:16:56.275 --> 01:16:59.793
you know what she
is capable of doing.

1398
01:16:59.827 --> 01:17:01.793
She tried to kill Kendrick.

1399
01:17:01.827 --> 01:17:05.344
your baby's father.
more than once

1400
01:17:05.379 --> 01:17:09.241
and you choose to defend her.
I mean please. tell me why.

1401
01:17:11.137 --> 01:17:12.931
Everyone's entitled
to a defense.

1402
01:17:12.965 --> 01:17:17.275
Oh hell no. no I
am not buying that.

1403
01:17:17.310 --> 01:17:20.517
She got something on
you. I know better.

1404
01:17:20.551 --> 01:17:21.931
I was just trying-

1405
01:17:21.965 --> 01:17:23.482
Trying to what?

1406
01:17:23.517 --> 01:17:24.310
Trying what Stacia huh?

1407
01:17:24.344 --> 01:17:25.137
You're trying to help?

1408
01:17:25.172 --> 01:17:28.551
Help this sociopath?

1409
01:17:28.586 --> 01:17:31.172
Cause you sure as hell ain't
helping me or Kendrick.

1410
01:17:31.689 --> 01:17:36.448
Oh God. I can't believe that
you are carrying his child.

1411
01:17:37.689 --> 01:17:41.068
that man loves you. he
will never leave you.

1412
01:17:41.103 --> 01:17:43.103
This? This is what you do?

1413
01:17:48.344 --> 01:17:49.586
I am sorry. Ella.

1414
01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:51.448
Yeah just go. just
get out of here.

1415
01:17:53.034 --> 01:17:54.862
[Leona laughing]

1416
01:17:54.896 --> 01:17:56.586
Well that was entertaining.

1417
01:17:58.068 --> 01:18:02.034
Did you really think I
wouldn't have an exit plan?

1418
01:18:03.379 --> 01:18:05.482
I really taught you nothing.

1419
01:18:05.965 --> 01:18:06.793
You know what?

1420
01:18:07.793 --> 01:18:09.137
This is the thing Leona.

1421
01:18:10.793 --> 01:18:13.551
you may be getting out
of a prison sentence.

1422
01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.896
but there's no exit for you.

1423
01:18:17.965 --> 01:18:18.862
Really?

1424
01:18:18.896 --> 01:18:21.103
Yeah. because you are a pariah.

1425
01:18:21.517 --> 01:18:24.758
you have destroyed anything
that's left of your name

1426
01:18:24.793 --> 01:18:26.379
and your reputation
here in Cyprus

1427
01:18:26.413 --> 01:18:29.000
and that's what matters to you.

1428
01:18:29.034 --> 01:18:31.655
That's what you lost.

1429
01:18:33.344 --> 01:18:34.172
Maybe.

1430
01:18:36.448 --> 01:18:39.413
but I learned a lesson
when I was quite young.

1431
01:18:41.586 --> 01:18:45.517
It is better to be
feared than loved

1432
01:18:46.689 --> 01:18:51.103
and every citizen in
Cyprus is afraid of me.

1433
01:18:53.344 --> 01:18:56.379
Well enjoy it mother dear.

1434
01:18:56.413 --> 01:19:00.103
because that's a very
lonely existence.

1435
01:19:02.931 --> 01:19:05.862
Ella. one more
thing before you go.

1436
01:19:08.551 --> 01:19:11.344
I didn't kill Malik Thompson.

1437
01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.034
I didn't put his
body in your pool.

1438
01:19:17.068 --> 01:19:20.137
but you might want to
think long and hard

1439
01:19:20.172 --> 01:19:23.758
about who did. Madam Mayor.

1440
01:19:29.724 --> 01:19:30.586
[knocking]

1441
01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:31.448
Come in.

1442
01:19:32.724 --> 01:19:35.310
Ms. Johnson. good
to see you again.

1443
01:19:35.344 --> 01:19:36.620
Please have a seat.

1444
01:19:39.517 --> 01:19:42.000
Yes. it's good to see you too.

1445
01:19:42.034 --> 01:19:44.275
Thank you for agreeing
to meet with me Dr. Ross.

1446
01:19:44.310 --> 01:19:46.172
Of course. it's my pleasure.

1447
01:19:46.206 --> 01:19:47.241
What can I do for you?

1448
01:19:48.793 --> 01:19:50.793
I want to apologize.

1449
01:19:50.827 --> 01:19:54.103
I was so scared about
everything involving Levi

1450
01:19:54.137 --> 01:19:58.275
and I know I wasn't the
most composed person

1451
01:19:58.310 --> 01:19:59.965
when I came in here before.

1452
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:03.034
I understand. When you're
closely connected to a patient.

1453
01:20:03.068 --> 01:20:05.137
it can be hard to separate
your personal feelings.

1454
01:20:05.172 --> 01:20:07.931
I was worried. so
worried about him.

1455
01:20:07.965 --> 01:20:10.344
especially when he ended
up in the hospital.

1456
01:20:10.379 --> 01:20:11.724
Thankfully it all worked out.

1457
01:20:11.758 --> 01:20:13.551
Yes. thanks to you.

1458
01:20:13.586 --> 01:20:15.551
That's actually why I'm here.

1459
01:20:16.724 --> 01:20:18.310
You know. I'm a doctor.

1460
01:20:18.344 --> 01:20:21.068
Yes. Levi spoke
very highly of you.

1461
01:20:21.103 --> 01:20:22.689
But what you may not know is

1462
01:20:22.724 --> 01:20:25.379
that I don't currently
have my medical license.

1463
01:20:26.206 --> 01:20:27.758
Hmm.

1464
01:20:29.310 --> 01:20:30.517
That's unfortunate.

1465
01:20:30.551 --> 01:20:32.413
But I'm going to do
something about that.

1466
01:20:32.448 --> 01:20:35.068
More importantly. I want
to do something about that.

1467
01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:39.000
because I would love
to work with you.

1468
01:20:39.034 --> 01:20:40.724
I want to learn from you.

1469
01:20:40.758 --> 01:20:41.793
Well...

1470
01:20:44.827 --> 01:20:46.965
...that could be
very interesting.

1471
01:20:47.448 --> 01:20:48.241
Pastor Green.

1472
01:20:50.137 --> 01:20:54.068
My lawyers have assured me
that Leona has absolutely no

1473
01:20:54.103 --> 01:20:56.068
further claim on the church.

1474
01:20:56.103 --> 01:20:58.137
I didn't realize she had a
claim in the first place.

1475
01:20:58.172 --> 01:21:00.206
Sometimes you got to make
a deal with the devil

1476
01:21:00.241 --> 01:21:02.000
on the path to salvation.

1477
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.517
Is that what you got. salvation?

1478
01:21:06.689 --> 01:21:09.413
I call it a new
chapter. a fresh start.

1479
01:21:12.034 --> 01:21:13.689
Well here's to that.

1480
01:21:13.724 --> 01:21:15.241
[laughing]

1481
01:21:15.275 --> 01:21:18.862
By the way. everything's set
on Malik Thompson's funeral.

1482
01:21:18.896 --> 01:21:21.862
I think Jabari will be
very proud of the sendoff

1483
01:21:21.896 --> 01:21:23.241
that we're giving
to his brother.

1484
01:21:23.275 --> 01:21:26.000
Good to hear. pastor
and thank you.

1485
01:21:26.034 --> 01:21:29.724
Just want to make sure Jabari
gets everything he deserves.

1486
01:21:29.758 --> 01:21:30.586
Me too.

1487
01:21:32.896 --> 01:21:35.103
Me too. [patting]

1488
01:21:37.724 --> 01:21:40.275
Everything he deserves.

1489
01:21:51.551 --> 01:21:52.793
Hey babe.

1490
01:21:52.827 --> 01:21:55.000
Hey sweetheart. you were
gone when I woke up.

1491
01:21:55.034 --> 01:21:57.448
Yeah I had to handle some
business at UpSurge.

1492
01:21:58.448 --> 01:21:59.275
[scoffing] Yeah.

1493
01:22:00.551 --> 01:22:03.793
You were so cute. I
didn't to wake you up.

1494
01:22:03.827 --> 01:22:05.551
You need your sleep.

1495
01:22:05.586 --> 01:22:09.275
Trust me. I got what
I need right here. [chuckling]

1496
01:22:11.206 --> 01:22:12.862
I gotta tell you something.

1497
01:22:12.896 --> 01:22:13.724
What?

1498
01:22:15.758 --> 01:22:17.000
It's complicated.

1499
01:22:18.275 --> 01:22:22.482
Listen. is this about
Leona not being charged?

1500
01:22:23.655 --> 01:22:25.758
I saw it on the news already.

1501
01:22:25.793 --> 01:22:29.241
It's no surprise. that woman
always escapes. you know that.

1502
01:22:30.724 --> 01:22:32.241
That's part of it.

1503
01:22:35.586 --> 01:22:38.862
I helped her. I got
Leona her immunity deal.

1504
01:22:38.896 --> 01:22:39.758
What?

1505
01:22:39.793 --> 01:22:41.724
She was threatening you.

1506
01:22:41.758 --> 01:22:43.758
I didn't know where
she was holding you.

1507
01:22:43.793 --> 01:22:46.000
I didn't know if you
were dead or alive.

1508
01:22:48.068 --> 01:22:49.551
So she made you help her.

1509
01:22:51.137 --> 01:22:51.965
Yes.

1510
01:22:53.931 --> 01:22:55.827
So you were protecting me.

1511
01:22:55.862 --> 01:22:56.655
I was.

1512
01:22:57.827 --> 01:23:01.448
I wanted to. I'm so sorry.

1513
01:23:03.758 --> 01:23:07.620
Listen. you don't have
nothing to be sorry about.

1514
01:23:07.655 --> 01:23:08.482
-But-
-Wait.

1515
01:23:10.275 --> 01:23:12.517
You did what you had
to do to keep me safe.

1516
01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.206
to protect our family.

1517
01:23:17.655 --> 01:23:20.034
How could I be mad at you
for something like that?

1518
01:23:22.551 --> 01:23:25.413
Sweetheart. you're going to
be a great mother to our baby.

1519
01:23:26.379 --> 01:23:28.206
Can't wait. I love you.

1520
01:23:30.482 --> 01:23:32.793
[gentle. dramatic music]

1521
01:23:32.827 --> 01:23:34.344
I love you.

1522
01:23:47.793 --> 01:23:49.000
Get in Jaleesa.

1523
01:24:02.896 --> 01:24:04.103
I don't want that.

1524
01:24:04.137 --> 01:24:06.068
It was a job well
done. you earned it.

1525
01:24:06.103 --> 01:24:07.482
I just want to find Candy.

1526
01:24:08.758 --> 01:24:09.655
You said you were
going to help me.

1527
01:24:09.689 --> 01:24:12.896
And a will. I keep my promises.

1528
01:24:12.931 --> 01:24:15.275
You did exactly as I asked you.

1529
01:24:15.310 --> 01:24:17.551
Now continue to keep
your mouth shut.

1530
01:24:20.862 --> 01:24:22.137
Can I go?

1531
01:24:22.172 --> 01:24:25.068
Of course. aren't you
forgetting something?

1532
01:24:36.275 --> 01:24:39.448
I knew this little burner
phone would come in handy.

1533
01:24:39.931 --> 01:24:41.103
[Leona chuckling]

1534
01:24:43.034 --> 01:24:46.655
Be careful out there Jaleesa.
the streets can be dangerous.

1535
01:24:49.896 --> 01:24:51.034
[knocking on door]

1536
01:25:04.379 --> 01:25:05.206
Can I come in?

1537
01:25:06.758 --> 01:25:09.103
When have you ever asked
for permission. Ella Mae?

1538
01:25:14.034 --> 01:25:19.000
So. I guess you already
heard about Leona?

1539
01:25:21.448 --> 01:25:22.275
No charges.

1540
01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:25.517
Yeah. no charges.

1541
01:25:25.551 --> 01:25:28.827
No charges for
terrorizing Kendrick.

1542
01:25:28.862 --> 01:25:32.137
no charges for terrorizing
the citizens of Cyprus.

1543
01:25:33.517 --> 01:25:35.689
and no charges for
setting me up for murder.

1544
01:25:35.724 --> 01:25:38.724
Wow. she got immunity
for all that stuff.

1545
01:25:39.931 --> 01:25:43.034
Well. you see. they
couldn't charge her

1546
01:25:43.068 --> 01:25:45.275
for setting me up for murder.

1547
01:25:47.517 --> 01:25:49.344
because she didn't do it. Rex.

1548
01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:51.448
You did.

1549
01:25:52.655 --> 01:25:56.931
You put Malik's body in my pool.

1550
01:25:56.965 --> 01:25:59.344
you set me up.

1551
01:26:05.482 --> 01:26:07.482
You know what Ella?

1552
01:26:09.206 --> 01:26:10.379
I sure as hell did.

1553
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:13.862
Why. Rex?

1554
01:26:16.620 --> 01:26:18.965
Do you hate me that much?

1555
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.379
You got it all wrong Ella.

1556
01:26:22.068 --> 01:26:23.413
I loved you that much.

1557
01:26:25.827 --> 01:26:28.827
You see Ella. you
threw it all away.

1558
01:26:30.137 --> 01:26:31.758
You killed my father.

1559
01:26:31.793 --> 01:26:32.689
So what?

1560
01:26:34.241 --> 01:26:35.206
You killed St .Jones.

1561
01:26:36.172 --> 01:26:40.000
Sheri Tucker. Ford. Paige.

1562
01:26:41.206 --> 01:26:44.344
You killed all of
them Ella. yeah.

1563
01:26:44.758 --> 01:26:46.448
Your body count is sky high.

1564
01:26:48.103 --> 01:26:49.758
The only difference
is you called me

1565
01:26:49.793 --> 01:26:52.206
and I was the one who
buried all the bodies.

1566
01:26:53.965 --> 01:26:55.965
But. see. where you
made the mistake Ella.

1567
01:26:57.413 --> 01:26:58.517
you got too comfortable.

1568
01:26:59.827 --> 01:27:02.551
You don't think I've felt it?

1569
01:27:02.586 --> 01:27:06.448
As much as I love you. the way
you were stringing me along.

1570
01:27:08.344 --> 01:27:10.000
playing me like a little bitch.

1571
01:27:11.206 --> 01:27:12.689
You got used to
living in a world

1572
01:27:12.724 --> 01:27:15.206
where I was your whipping
boy and your greatest ally.

1573
01:27:16.413 --> 01:27:17.827
But you should get used
to living in the world

1574
01:27:17.862 --> 01:27:20.724
where Rex Fisher is
your biggest enemy.

1575
01:27:22.275 --> 01:27:23.793
So no. you didn't kill Malik.

1576
01:27:24.965 --> 01:27:26.724
but your ass is
going down for it.

1577
01:27:30.206 --> 01:27:31.344
-So here's to you Ella.
-[dramatic music]

1578
01:27:32.827 --> 01:27:37.620
Game over. I'm gonna be
your worst nightmare.

1579
01:27:38.379 --> 01:27:40.896
[shattering glass]

1580
01:27:40.931 --> 01:27:43.655
