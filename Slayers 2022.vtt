00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:35.085
with you later.

178
00:08:35.119 --> 00:08:36.720
Muah. Love you.

179
00:08:47.926 --> 00:08:48.948
David. what the hell?

180
00:08:48.981 --> 00:08:50.455
I thought you said this thing
had seamless Wi-Fi.

181
00:08:50.479 --> 00:08:52.755
Well. it's working just fine
for me.

182
00:08:53.686 --> 00:08:54.834
Same here. babe.

183
00:08:54.867 --> 00:08:56.188
You probably just hit
a dead zone.

184
00:08:57.747 --> 00:09:01.037
Ugh. man meat is being such
a whiny little bitch.

185
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:02.324
Who?

186
00:09:02.357 --> 00:09:04.244
Jason. You know. my side thing.

187
00:09:04.277 --> 00:09:05.957
"How could I leave without
saying goodbye?"

188
00:09:07.569 --> 00:09:10.035
I swear. sometimes I really miss
toxic masculinity.

189
00:09:10.069 --> 00:09:11.565
Hey. I'm still
toxically masculine.

190
00:09:11.599 --> 00:09:13.517
What bitches. ho. what?

191
00:09:14.964 --> 00:09:16.428
I thought Jason
was your boyfriend.

192
00:09:16.462 --> 00:09:18.253
Boyfriend?

193
00:09:18.287 --> 00:09:18.989
Don't get it twisted.

194
00:09:19.023 --> 00:09:20.754
You said you were
gonna marry him!

195
00:09:20.787 --> 00:09:22.547
I say a lot of things.

196
00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:23.991
I think maybe you're just
looking for like

197
00:09:24.015 --> 00:09:27.790
a Disney fantasy relationship
with a prince charming.

198
00:09:27.824 --> 00:09:30.733
when maybe you need
to find Patience

199
00:09:30.767 --> 00:09:34.035
and some good in people
and get past your own fears.

200
00:09:34.069 --> 00:09:35.438
Thank you.
but I really don't need

201
00:09:35.472 --> 00:09:38.002
your heteronormative ideas
on romance.

202
00:09:38.035 --> 00:09:38.994
Heteronormative?

203
00:09:39.027 --> 00:09:40.048
Dude. I'm a lesbian.

204
00:09:40.082 --> 00:09:42.992
Exactly. Shackled by labels.

205
00:09:43.025 --> 00:09:45.133
- Yo David. where we at?
- - Lost.

206
00:09:45.167 --> 00:09:47.444
We're over an hour late
and the sun is going down.

207
00:09:47.477 --> 00:09:49.037
Not my fault.
It's this waze.

208
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.727
It keeps losing signal
and moving our location.

209
00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.385
Oh. god. he seriously.
he just missed another turn.

210
00:09:54.419 --> 00:09:55.693
Yeah. David. uh. one question.

211
00:09:55.727 --> 00:09:57.527
Do you think you could manage
to get us there?

212
00:09:57.552 --> 00:09:58.350
Shut up!

213
00:09:58.384 --> 00:10:00.082
You guys are ruining
my concentration.

214
00:10:01.265 --> 00:10:02.804
This ruin your concentration.
David?

215
00:10:02.837 --> 00:10:04.460
- Like this...
- - Ladies...

216
00:10:04.493 --> 00:10:06.253
-Oh. no...

217
00:10:06.287 --> 00:10:07.920
David. does this ruin
your concentration?

218
00:10:09.072 --> 00:10:10.072
It's not funny.

219
00:10:12.437 --> 00:10:14.028
Come on.
Stop acting like kids.

220
00:10:14.062 --> 00:10:14.862
Please. David. I'm so bored.

221
00:10:14.895 --> 00:10:15.895
Yeah. guys. stop.

222
00:10:17.712 --> 00:10:19.314
You can't drive. David. Really?

223
00:10:19.347 --> 00:10:21.360
This is really important.
you guys.

224
00:10:31.279 --> 00:10:33.070
Who the fuck is this guy?

225
00:10:33.104 --> 00:10:34.547
Don't worry. I'll handle this.

226
00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:35.950
Well. that's a terrible idea.

227
00:10:47.472 --> 00:10:49.232
Well. he seems fun.

228
00:10:49.265 --> 00:10:50.835
Shut up. he can hear you.

229
00:10:50.869 --> 00:10:53.040
Jack. why don't you just go
tell him who we are.

230
00:10:53.074 --> 00:10:55.087
Um. I don't think
he's gonna care.

231
00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.268
Look. I'm gonna talk to him.

232
00:10:56.302 --> 00:10:57.260
Just act cool. guys.

233
00:10:57.293 --> 00:10:58.895
- I got this.
- Do you?

234
00:11:01.809 --> 00:11:02.735
Hey. buddy.

235
00:11:02.769 --> 00:11:03.822
Not your buddy.

236
00:11:03.855 --> 00:11:05.710
Ah. okay. Hi.
Sir. how are you doing?

237
00:11:05.744 --> 00:11:06.541
I'm Jack.

238
00:11:06.576 --> 00:11:08.115
- Am I supposed to give a shit?
- Okay.

239
00:11:08.149 --> 00:11:12.082
Hey. I am...
I love your sunglasses.

240
00:11:12.115 --> 00:11:13.812
Are they vintage ray-ban?

241
00:11:13.846 --> 00:11:14.899
Fuck off.

242
00:11:14.932 --> 00:11:16.048
Okay. I think we're done.

243
00:11:17.812 --> 00:11:20.142
You got no idea of how much
trouble you're in. do you?

244
00:11:20.175 --> 00:11:22.157
Look. dude.
you came out of nowhere.

245
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.467
We didn't even hit you
and you're fine.

246
00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.862
- What's your problem?
- My problem is you.

247
00:11:28.815 --> 00:11:31.124
Turn around. get back
in your little party bus.

248
00:11:31.157 --> 00:11:33.297
Flip a bit.
and get the fuck out of here.

249
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.525
Or. and I promise you.
you'll suffer.

250
00:11:38.447 --> 00:11:40.365
Adult to adult.
you're kinda freaking us out.

251
00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:41.905
Look. we're really sorry.

252
00:11:41.939 --> 00:11:43.983
We just wanna pass through.
so...

253
00:11:44.017 --> 00:11:46.093
If there's anything we can do.
uh. maybe you need.

254
00:11:46.127 --> 00:11:47.117
uh. some extra money.

255
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:48.910
I mean if you wanted... oh. shit.

256
00:11:48.944 --> 00:11:50.387
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

257
00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:51.663
Hey. hey. hey!

258
00:11:54.735 --> 00:11:56.084
You've been warned.

259
00:11:59.314 --> 00:12:00.947
<i>Fucking kids.</i>

260
00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:02.350
<i>They can't resist an invite</i>

261
00:12:02.384 --> 00:12:05.262
<i>to act like
self-important assholes.</i>

262
00:12:05.295 --> 00:12:08.268
<i>Perfect prey for evil predators
like rektor.</i>

263
00:12:08.302 --> 00:12:11.053
<i>Not to mention the temptation
of fame and money.</i>

264
00:12:11.087 --> 00:12:13.838
<i>Now this I know too well.</i>

265
00:12:16.562 --> 00:12:19.314
Your dad's so lame.

266
00:12:19.347 --> 00:12:20.622
Maybe if you didn't get a dui.

267
00:12:20.655 --> 00:12:22.194
we wouldn't have to use him
for a ride.

268
00:12:37.619 --> 00:12:39.537
- What?
- I don't know.

269
00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:41.466
Oh. my god. you're not about
to back out on this.

270
00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:42.891
Don't you think
it's a little shady?

271
00:12:45.139 --> 00:12:47.437
An older record label exec
inviting two teenagers

272
00:12:47.471 --> 00:12:49.199
to his hotel room for a meeting?

273
00:12:49.233 --> 00:12:51.214
So he can listen to our demo.
mol.

274
00:12:51.248 --> 00:12:52.459
This is how it happens.

275
00:12:52.492 --> 00:12:54.157
- What?
- Getting raped?

276
00:12:57.556 --> 00:12:59.569
Molly and alexx
from<i> surburban trash.</i>

277
00:13:03.886 --> 00:13:06.353
Thought this was supposed to be
a listening party.

278
00:13:06.386 --> 00:13:07.819
Are you tripping right now?

279
00:13:07.852 --> 00:13:09.264
I'm tripping.

280
00:13:09.298 --> 00:13:11.089
This shit is really happening.
girl.

281
00:13:13.423 --> 00:13:14.961
Al? Alexx?

282
00:13:16.461 --> 00:13:18.284
Al?

283
00:13:19.341 --> 00:13:20.531
Jackpot. biatch!

284
00:13:20.565 --> 00:13:21.713
Fuck you. dude.

285
00:13:21.746 --> 00:13:23.052
You scared the crap out of me.

286
00:13:23.086 --> 00:13:24.107
What's your problem?

287
00:13:24.141 --> 00:13:25.996
Something's off.

288
00:13:26.029 --> 00:13:27.916
Stop being such a straightedge.

289
00:13:27.949 --> 00:13:30.859
Just play the demo. have a beer.

290
00:13:30.892 --> 00:13:32.051
We'll set a mood.

291
00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:38.233
Okay. now what?

292
00:13:39.954 --> 00:13:41.071
We wait.

293
00:13:41.104 --> 00:13:42.643
<i>First off.</i>

294
00:13:42.676 --> 00:13:45.681
<i>the hotel suite is not even
that nice.</i>

295
00:13:45.714 --> 00:13:47.601
<i>But when you hear somebody
in the other room</i>

296
00:13:47.634 --> 00:13:49.647
<i>speak in an ancient
double tongue</i>

297
00:13:49.681 --> 00:13:52.274
<i>with one of them
low demonic filters on it</i>

298
00:13:52.308 --> 00:13:54.163
<i>that you hear in every
exorcist film...</i>

299
00:13:55.663 --> 00:13:57.138
<i>You should probably
take the hint.</i>

300
00:14:02.161 --> 00:14:05.936
I'm alexx.
lead singer of suburban trash.

301
00:14:05.969 --> 00:14:10.514
Umm. and this is Molly.
the bassist.

302
00:14:10.548 --> 00:14:12.466
We've had a few...

303
00:14:21.076 --> 00:14:22.963
Oh. fuck.

304
00:14:29.358 --> 00:14:30.358
<i>Guess who?</i>

305
00:14:33.936 --> 00:14:35.759
I'm sorry. daddy. I screwed up.

306
00:14:35.793 --> 00:14:37.426
Where are you now?

307
00:14:37.459 --> 00:14:39.251
Eleventh floor.

308
00:14:39.285 --> 00:14:40.433
<i>Honey?</i>

309
00:14:40.466 --> 00:14:41.393
<i>Honey?</i>

310
00:14:41.426 --> 00:14:42.669
Just make it go away.

311
00:14:47.091 --> 00:14:49.231
<i>Every slayer needs
his own origin story.</i>

312
00:14:49.264 --> 00:14:51.182
<i>Even your old buddy.
Elliot Jones.</i>

313
00:14:52.398 --> 00:14:53.195
Dad?

314
00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:55.276
Sweetie. where...
Where are you right now?

315
00:14:55.309 --> 00:14:56.531
I'm sorry.

316
00:14:56.565 --> 00:14:58.704
-Hey. honey?

317
00:15:02.736 --> 00:15:05.139
That night changed everything.

318
00:15:13.043 --> 00:15:15.024
<i>Some people mourn
like my ex-wife.</i>

319
00:15:15.058 --> 00:15:16.427
<i>With a bunch of pills</i>

320
00:15:16.461 --> 00:15:18.674
<i>and a new boyfriend
named Enrique.</i>

321
00:15:20.818 --> 00:15:23.443
<i>But some search for the truth.</i>

322
00:15:23.476 --> 00:15:27.473
<i>And in my case.
the truth had fangs.</i>

323
00:15:27.506 --> 00:15:29.424
<i>And thus. my new life began.</i>

324
00:15:31.314 --> 00:15:34.098
<i>As bodies began to mount.
there was a pattern.</i>

325
00:15:37.581 --> 00:15:41.651
<i>Folks being murdered.
more like harvested.</i>

326
00:15:41.685 --> 00:15:43.951
<i>all had the same thing
in common.</i>

327
00:15:43.984 --> 00:15:47.474
<i>their blood.
the rarest blood on earth.</i>

328
00:15:51.443 --> 00:15:54.131
<i>Bloodline leading back
to these dumb fucks.</i>

329
00:16:23.692 --> 00:16:24.692
Jack?

330
00:16:27.986 --> 00:16:29.873
- What's up?
- Look at this.

331
00:16:31.984 --> 00:16:33.934
What is this.
from the winnebago guy?

332
00:16:33.968 --> 00:16:36.593
Yeah. what if he isn't
threatening us.

333
00:16:36.626 --> 00:16:37.964
he was trying to warn us?

334
00:16:37.998 --> 00:16:39.821
You've been warned.

335
00:16:39.854 --> 00:16:40.854
Oh. with this?

336
00:16:42.165 --> 00:16:44.114
Come on. calm down. qanon.

337
00:16:44.148 --> 00:16:45.296
But you don't know anything.

338
00:16:45.329 --> 00:16:47.469
What if... what if this is legit?

339
00:16:47.503 --> 00:16:49.579
Oh. my god.
You always think the worst.

340
00:16:49.612 --> 00:16:50.443
Did it ever occur to you that

341
00:16:50.477 --> 00:16:53.651
this might turn out to be
a good thing?

342
00:16:53.685 --> 00:16:55.603
Holy shit.
Flynn. come here look.

343
00:16:55.636 --> 00:16:58.061
Jack. Jack. come here.
you have to see this.

344
00:16:58.094 --> 00:16:59.052
Come on.

345
00:16:59.087 --> 00:17:02.059
Listen. I promise you.
it's gonna be fine. okay?

346
00:17:11.988 --> 00:17:14.444
Oh. my god.
look. is that Harry rektor?

347
00:17:14.478 --> 00:17:15.531
That's Steven's nephew.

348
00:17:15.566 --> 00:17:19.212
He has the most amazing animal
protection non-profit.

349
00:17:19.246 --> 00:17:21.649
I think I might be in love.

350
00:17:21.683 --> 00:17:23.664
- Hm-mm.
- What?

351
00:17:23.698 --> 00:17:24.698
You told me to grow up.

352
00:17:32.179 --> 00:17:33.422

new super vaccine

532

00:25:39.794 --> 00:25:41.712
Being totally immune
to everything.

535
00:25:41.746 --> 00:25:44.265
And for your promotion
to your combined user base

536
00:25:44.299 --> 00:25:46.185
of 55 million plus.

537
00:25:46.219 --> 00:25:49.519
we're gonna pay you to the tune
of $15 million.

538
00:25:49.552 --> 00:25:50.605
And that's just year one.

539
00:25:52.464 --> 00:25:53.707
Holy shit.

Nope.

549
00:26:10.609 --> 00:26:14.764
Uh. um.
do you mind giving us a beat?

550
00:26:14.797 --> 00:26:15.797
Of course.

551
00:26:20.431 --> 00:26:21.979
Jesus. Flynn.
we're about to make millions

552
00:26:22.003 --> 00:26:23.057
by saving the world.

553
00:26:23.091 --> 00:26:24.985
How is it possible you can find
a problem with that?

554
00:26:25.009 --> 00:26:26.220
She's got a point. sis.

555
00:26:26.254 --> 00:26:27.761
But why us?

556
00:26:27.794 --> 00:26:30.641
Uh. hello.
She literally just told us.

557
00:26:30.674 --> 00:26:32.909
No way. they're...
They're hiding something. okay.

558
00:26:32.942 --> 00:26:35.441
That's too much money.
It's too top secret.

559
00:26:35.474 --> 00:26:36.369
That paper that
that guy gave me today...

560
00:26:36.403 --> 00:26:37.329
No. no.

561
00:26:37.363 --> 00:26:38.552
are you seriously talking
about the creepy guy

562
00:26:38.576 --> 00:26:39.502
who threatened to kill us?

563
00:26:39.536 --> 00:26:40.494
- Gross.
- Okay.

564
00:26:40.527 --> 00:26:41.897
Yes. the amount they're offering

565
00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:43.383
- is weirdly high.
- I mean. we would have do...

566
00:26:43.407 --> 00:26:44.714
We would have done this
for what?

567
00:26:44.747 --> 00:26:45.737
Half a mil?

568
00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:47.119
And also. where's David?

569
00:26:47.152 --> 00:26:48.490
- He should be here. right?
- Yes.

570
00:26:48.524 --> 00:26:49.809
Okay. seriously. Jack.

571
00:26:49.843 --> 00:26:50.927
I can't with her.

572
00:26:50.961 --> 00:26:52.267
You always side
with your sister.

573
00:26:52.301 --> 00:26:53.259
What?

574
00:26:53.293 --> 00:26:56.170
Look. she is not you're only
dependent anymore.

575
00:26:56.204 --> 00:26:57.742
I'm your family now.

576
00:26:57.776 --> 00:26:59.257
Come on. don't you trust
my instincts?

577
00:27:03.472 --> 00:27:04.472
I'm sorry.

578
00:27:06.701 --> 00:27:08.587
- Fuck this. I'm out.
- Flynn?

579
00:27:08.621 --> 00:27:10.507
Jack. look.
just let her go. okay.

580
00:27:10.541 --> 00:27:12.617
Let her go.
It's not about her.

581
00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:14.379
This is about us.

582
00:27:14.412 --> 00:27:15.982
Okay.

583
00:27:16.016 --> 00:27:18.219
You built the stream team
from the ground up.

584
00:27:18.252 --> 00:27:19.252
You deserve this.

585
00:27:20.784 --> 00:27:22.122
Okay.

586
00:27:22.156 --> 00:27:23.884
Yeah. okay. Yeah.

587
00:27:23.917 --> 00:27:24.907
Let's do this.

588
00:27:24.941 --> 00:27:25.994
- Okay.
- Okay.

589
00:27:30.447 --> 00:27:34.961
Now. before you sign.
there's just one more thing.

590
00:27:34.994 --> 00:27:37.450
Times are changing
in our media empire.

591
00:27:37.484 --> 00:27:40.267
And because of Steven's health
and none of our heirs

592
00:27:40.301 --> 00:27:42.060
willing to take the reins.

593
00:27:42.094 --> 00:27:44.139
we've been on the hunt
for new partners.

594
00:27:44.172 --> 00:27:46.122
Not just to carry on the legacy
of our company.

595
00:27:46.156 --> 00:27:49.329
but to reinvent it
for today's audience.

596
00:27:49.363 --> 00:27:51.724
<i>Jack. I've been watching you
for years.</i>

597
00:27:51.757 --> 00:27:55.469
<i>You can do so much more
and with my power.</i>

598
00:27:55.502 --> 00:27:56.745
<i>you'll be unstoppable.</i>

599
00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:00.078
Uh. I'm sorry.

600
00:28:00.111 --> 00:28:02.030
Are you talking
about giving us your...

601
00:28:02.063 --> 00:28:03.886
<i>My company?</i>

602
00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.384
<i>Yes.</i>

603
00:28:05.418 --> 00:28:06.988
Oh.

604
00:28:07.021 --> 00:28:08.296
Oh. my god.

605
00:28:08.329 --> 00:28:09.551
It's really happening. babe.

606
00:28:09.585 --> 00:28:10.575
We're gonna be billionaires.

607
00:28:10.608 --> 00:28:11.788
Babe.

608
00:28:11.821 --> 00:28:12.779
Ahem.

609
00:28:12.813 --> 00:28:14.288
Uh. no offense.

610
00:28:14.322 --> 00:28:17.674
We are insanely flattered.
but um... why us?

611
00:28:17.708 --> 00:28:19.404
It's simple math. really.

612
00:28:19.438 --> 00:28:21.324
Our research shows
that you alone engage

613
00:28:21.358 --> 00:28:23.498
with ten times more users
under the age of 25

614
00:28:23.531 --> 00:28:27.179
than any other public figure
in the world.

615
00:28:27.213 --> 00:28:28.393
I do?

616
00:28:28.426 --> 00:28:30.798
Of course you do.
my handsome man.

617
00:28:32.047 --> 00:28:33.877
<i>Your 55 million followers
are just the beginning.</i>

618
00:28:33.901 --> 00:28:35.693
<i>Combined with our network
capabilities.</i>

619
00:28:35.726 --> 00:28:37.708
<i>they will expand to hundreds
of millions.</i>

620
00:28:37.741 --> 00:28:39.754
<i>become the backbone
of consumer buyers.</i>

621
00:28:39.788 --> 00:28:42.824
<i>controlling advertising spends.
political influence.</i>

622
00:28:42.858 --> 00:28:44.143
<i>and world markets.</i>

623
00:28:47.341 --> 00:28:50.473
What we're proposing
is a trial merger.

624
00:28:50.506 --> 00:28:53.004
See. how we feel about you
and your new role

625
00:28:53.038 --> 00:28:54.735
as leader of our media group

626
00:28:54.768 --> 00:28:56.889
and after six months.
we make it a little more formal.

627
00:28:59.758 --> 00:29:01.328
It's a simple offer sheet.

628
00:29:01.362 --> 00:29:02.668
David already looked it over.

629
00:29:02.701 --> 00:29:04.398
- It's just...
- Oh. fuck.

630
00:29:05.328 --> 00:29:07.088
Anything you see
or participate in

631
00:29:07.122 --> 00:29:09.641
during this trial merger
stays between us.

632
00:29:09.675 --> 00:29:12.943
It's like a formal family deal
before all the business stuff

633
00:29:12.976 --> 00:29:14.030
gets ironed out.

634
00:29:18.188 --> 00:29:19.600
Yeah.

635
00:29:24.433 --> 00:29:25.866
You ready?

636
00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:30.634
Uh... here we go.

637
00:29:37.905 --> 00:29:38.926
Great.

638
00:29:41.682 --> 00:29:43.146
- Oh. it's amazing.
- Yeah.

639
00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:49.001
This is seriously the best day
of my life.

640
00:29:49.035 --> 00:29:50.515
Well. I mean apart
from our wedding...

641
00:29:50.543 --> 00:29:52.335
- Yeah.
- Of course.

642
00:29:52.368 --> 00:29:53.706
What's up. my jullionaires?

643
00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:57.103
I'm getting ready for a date
with a real life cowboy.

644
00:29:57.136 --> 00:30:00.299
So. if you have pro tips.
make sure to dm them to me

645
00:30:00.333 --> 00:30:03.053
or comment down below
to impress him.

646
00:30:03.086 --> 00:30:06.218
And I've also been using
wewe face glow.

647
00:30:06.251 --> 00:30:09.066
which is what's keeping me
glowing.

648
00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:12.590
So. uh. for more info.
just check in the link above.

649
00:30:12.623 --> 00:30:15.596
Or swipe up to see more.

650
00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:16.630
Bye. guys.

651
00:30:19.406 --> 00:30:20.459
Oh. Jesus.

652
00:30:22.381 --> 00:30:23.951
What. is the deal off?

653
00:30:23.985 --> 00:30:26.156
No. deal's very much on.

654
00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:28.013
Then what's wrong?

655
00:30:28.046 --> 00:30:30.006
Uh. there is something seriously
off about this place

656
00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:32.011
and I want no part of it.

657
00:30:32.045 --> 00:30:33.488
Okay.

658
00:30:33.522 --> 00:30:35.144
Don't have a Flynn attack.

659
00:30:35.178 --> 00:30:37.486
- Calm down.
- I'm calm.

660
00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.913
I'm just telling you
I think we should go now.

661
00:30:39.946 --> 00:30:41.611
What about your brother and Liz?

662
00:30:41.645 --> 00:30:43.594
They won't listen.

663
00:30:43.628 --> 00:30:45.356
I think this shit's bad.

664
00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:48.204
Okay. what if that guy
on the road earlier was right

665
00:30:48.238 --> 00:30:50.219
and these people
aren't just greedy.

666
00:30:50.253 --> 00:30:51.823
they're evil?

667
00:30:51.856 --> 00:30:53.321
Evil. really?

668
00:30:53.355 --> 00:30:55.790
That thing I read earlier said
rektor's up to something.

669
00:30:55.823 --> 00:30:58.184
And now they're offering us
all this crazy money

670
00:30:58.218 --> 00:30:59.914
to help them promote it.

671
00:30:59.948 --> 00:31:01.391
What kind of money?

672
00:31:01.425 --> 00:31:02.478
Half a mil? Million?

673
00:31:02.511 --> 00:31:04.271
Are they including me?

674
00:31:04.305 --> 00:31:05.548
I'm serious.

675
00:31:05.581 --> 00:31:07.626
- Are you coming with me or not?
- I would.

676
00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:09.261
I really. really would but um.

677
00:31:09.295 --> 00:31:10.696
actually I have a date tonight.

678
00:31:10.729 --> 00:31:12.363
Harry.

679
00:31:12.396 --> 00:31:14.251
A date.

680
00:31:14.285 --> 00:31:15.855
Oh. Flynn. come on.

681
00:31:15.888 --> 00:31:17.711
No. no. it's super cool.

682
00:31:17.745 --> 00:31:18.798
No one believes me.

683
00:31:18.831 --> 00:31:21.034
Everyone thinks
I'm just fucking nuts.

684
00:31:21.068 --> 00:31:23.914
I guess I'll try to find
a signal somewhere

685
00:31:23.948 --> 00:31:25.644
and see if I can catch an uber

686
00:31:25.678 --> 00:31:28.778
to go play my semi-final
deathmatch alone.

687
00:31:28.811 --> 00:31:30.793
Okay. sorry.

688
00:31:30.826 --> 00:31:32.523
Text me.

689
00:31:32.556 --> 00:31:33.797
Good luck with your deathmatch.

690
00:31:46.155 --> 00:31:47.566
You gotta be shitting me.

691
00:31:54.383 --> 00:31:55.563
I can... unbelievable.

692
00:32:01.483 --> 00:32:03.496
Merry Christmas. motherfuckers.

693
00:32:40.716 --> 00:32:42.508
-Shhh. shh.

694
00:32:42.541 --> 00:32:43.816
Don't... don't move.

695
00:32:43.849 --> 00:32:44.713
Sshh.

696
00:32:44.746 --> 00:32:47.213
Don't scream.

697
00:32:47.246 --> 00:32:49.038
- Get away from me.
- Shhh.

698
00:32:49.071 --> 00:32:50.768
The feeding hour is upon us.

699
00:32:50.802 --> 00:32:53.775
Their heightened senses means
they can see everything.

700
00:32:56.203 --> 00:32:57.161
What the hell's the matter
with you. dude?

701
00:32:57.195 --> 00:32:58.543
You can't just grab me.

702
00:32:58.576 --> 00:32:59.819
You know what?

703
00:32:59.853 --> 00:33:00.884
They had a valid fucking point.

704
00:33:00.908 --> 00:33:01.739
You're the one
I should be scared of.

705
00:33:01.773 --> 00:33:03.818
Not rektor.

706
00:33:03.851 --> 00:33:04.935
Put that mace down.

707
00:33:04.968 --> 00:33:06.602
I'm trying to save you. Flynn.

708
00:33:06.635 --> 00:33:07.688
How do you know my name?

709
00:33:07.722 --> 00:33:08.488
I'll explain that later.

710
00:33:08.522 --> 00:33:10.157
No. you're going to
explain it now

711
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:11.212
or I'm screaming.

712
00:33:11.245 --> 00:33:12.366
We don't have time for this.

713
00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:15.242
Yeah. yeah. you're right.

714
00:33:17.005 --> 00:33:18.185
Where the hell are you going?

715
00:33:18.219 --> 00:33:19.630
Hey!

716
00:33:19.664 --> 00:33:21.645
You can't get a fucking signal
out here.

717
00:33:21.679 --> 00:33:23.440
They only get a signal
when they want you to.

718
00:33:24.137 --> 00:33:24.935
Hey?

719
00:33:24.969 --> 00:33:27.469
Come with me now
before it's too late.

720
00:33:27.502 --> 00:33:28.903
I don't need your help. old man.

721
00:33:35.688 --> 00:33:37.069
Oh. I love this.

722
00:33:37.102 --> 00:33:40.972
The smell is so authentic.

723
00:33:41.005 --> 00:33:42.217
It's great.

724
00:33:45.067 --> 00:33:47.143
Jules...

725
00:33:47.177 --> 00:33:48.842
I'm waiting for you.

726
00:33:48.875 --> 00:33:49.897
Harry?

727
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:53.832
Is that you?

728
00:33:53.865 --> 00:33:55.752
Why don't you come this way.
little lady?

729
00:33:58.992 --> 00:34:01.353
Shit.

730
00:34:24.459 --> 00:34:25.480
Guys?

731
00:34:25.514 --> 00:34:26.925
Guys?

732
00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:32.907
Jack?

733
00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:33.962
Liz?

734
00:34:40.905 --> 00:34:41.905
Shit.

735
00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:51.147
That's more like it.

736
00:35:14.315 --> 00:35:15.885
Shit!

737
00:35:15.919 --> 00:35:16.919
Fuck.

738
00:35:27.977 --> 00:35:30.222
Calm down. you freak.

739
00:35:30.255 --> 00:35:32.016
You're just letting Flynn
get into your head.

740
00:35:42.377 --> 00:35:44.622
I uh. took the Liberty
of trying the wine.

741
00:35:46.059 --> 00:35:47.080
It's really good.

742
00:35:48.812 --> 00:35:51.374
Is it biodynamic?

743
00:35:51.407 --> 00:35:52.587
Jules?

744
00:35:59.277 --> 00:36:01.775
Don't worry. cutie.
I'm coming for you.

745
00:36:10.248 --> 00:36:12.072
Hello. Jules.

746
00:36:12.105 --> 00:36:13.359
Oh. shit.

747
00:36:14.732 --> 00:36:18.222
Listen. I'm not gonna
tell anyone

748
00:36:18.255 --> 00:36:20.332
what you guys are up to.

749
00:36:20.365 --> 00:36:21.387
-I promise.

750
00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:23.275
Just... just... just let me go.

751
00:36:23.309 --> 00:36:25.100
That's not happening. Jules.

752
00:36:25.134 --> 00:36:26.862
Okay. I thought
that you were a nice guy!

753
00:36:26.895 --> 00:36:28.043
No. I ain't.

754
00:36:28.077 --> 00:36:29.130
Why me?

755
00:36:29.164 --> 00:36:30.797
You... you love animals.

756
00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:32.073
Remember. the whales?

757
00:36:32.107 --> 00:36:33.835
I love animals.

758
00:36:33.869 --> 00:36:36.008
I just hate humans.

759
00:36:37.614 --> 00:36:38.614
Jules!

760
00:36:41.897 --> 00:36:44.110
You smell tender and juicy.

761
00:36:44.144 --> 00:36:46.990
Aah!

762
00:36:47.024 --> 00:36:49.227
Never trust a guy
with a man bun.

763
00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:50.260
Jules!

764
00:36:53.997 --> 00:36:56.137
Flynn! Flynn!

765
00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:57.550
Don't fight the catch...

766
00:36:59.789 --> 00:37:01.485
We have a connection.

767
00:37:18.314 --> 00:37:20.654
- Jules!
- Flynn! Flynn!

768
00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:30.602
Ah!

769
00:37:36.881 --> 00:37:38.408
<i>Lesson learned.</i>

770
00:37:38.442 --> 00:37:40.877
<i>Never accept a date from a dude
with a man bun.</i>

771
00:37:47.535 --> 00:37:49.865
No. No. no. no. no.

772
00:37:49.899 --> 00:37:52.365
<i>No more swipes up for you.
sweetheart.</i>

773
00:37:54.794 --> 00:37:56.975
You have nowhere to run!

774
00:38:08.044 --> 00:38:10.024
Looks like you needed my help
after all.

775
00:38:10.058 --> 00:38:10.824
How did you...

776
00:38:10.857 --> 00:38:12.936
Know you're gonna get
eaten alive?

777
00:38:12.969 --> 00:38:13.969
Kind of. yeah.

778
00:38:22.063 --> 00:38:23.782
You should come out with me.
I'll show you.

779
00:38:27.496 --> 00:38:28.391
Really?

780
00:38:28.424 --> 00:38:30.121
We're gonna do this shit again?

781
00:38:30.154 --> 00:38:31.724
No. no. I'm coming. I just...

782
00:38:31.758 --> 00:38:33.096
We have to save my brother. too.

783
00:38:34.216 --> 00:38:36.039
Alright. we'll see. Come on.

784
00:38:41.263 --> 00:38:43.751
Oh. wow.

785
00:38:43.784 --> 00:38:45.639
This feels like...

786
00:38:45.673 --> 00:38:46.673
Home?

787
00:38:50.029 --> 00:38:53.836
Our 500 print and television
subsidiaries worldwide

788
00:38:53.869 --> 00:38:56.684
make up 90 percent
of the global market.

789
00:38:56.718 --> 00:38:59.438
By the end of the decade.
we plan to have acquired

790
00:38:59.471 --> 00:39:00.967
- all of them.
- Sweet.

791
00:39:01.001 --> 00:39:01.799
People. they call me.

792
00:39:01.833 --> 00:39:04.238
heartless. a capitalist.
a gold digger.

793
00:39:04.271 --> 00:39:06.854
And this of course one
of our many satellite locations.

794
00:39:06.887 --> 00:39:09.449
where all data and imagery
are run through our algorithms

795
00:39:09.483 --> 00:39:11.148
straight up to the cloud.

796
00:39:11.181 --> 00:39:12.846
Sweet.

797
00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:15.209
Algorithms are kind of my jam.

798
00:39:15.243 --> 00:39:17.804
I just... I keep searching
for a sense of security

799
00:39:17.838 --> 00:39:19.334
and I know that the second
I find it.

800
00:39:19.367 --> 00:39:20.874
I'm gonna be a whole new person.

801
00:39:22.184 --> 00:39:26.634
Well. I think you found it.
baby girl.

802
00:39:26.668 --> 00:39:27.668
Come on.

803
00:39:28.683 --> 00:39:30.284
We like to think
of our algorithm

804
00:39:30.318 --> 00:39:32.394
as a giant filter

805
00:39:32.428 --> 00:39:35.306
for all the world's facts.
narratives. and viewpoints.

806
00:39:35.339 --> 00:39:36.551
You ready for some real fun?

807
00:39:36.584 --> 00:39:37.584
Yes.

808
00:39:40.909 --> 00:39:42.247
Oh. wow.

809
00:39:42.281 --> 00:39:44.041
Whether you're moderate
or conservative

810
00:39:44.074 --> 00:39:47.817
leftist. fascist. anarchist.
it doesn't matter to us.

811
00:39:47.851 --> 00:39:50.349
My 1975 halston.

812
00:39:50.383 --> 00:39:53.229
Jackie onassis wore it once
before I bought it.

813
00:39:53.263 --> 00:39:54.474
Do you wanna try it on?

814
00:39:54.508 --> 00:39:56.204
Heck yeah.

815
00:40:01.607 --> 00:40:04.201
What's mine is yours.

816
00:40:04.234 --> 00:40:05.773
Our ethos has always been.

817
00:40:05.806 --> 00:40:07.851
why be a part
of the conversation.

818
00:40:07.884 --> 00:40:10.636
when you could construct
the conversation itself?

819
00:40:12.104 --> 00:40:13.104
Great question.

820
00:40:15.881 --> 00:40:16.962
Sorry. was that a question?

821
00:40:22.633 --> 00:40:25.131
Good eye.

822
00:40:25.164 --> 00:40:28.106
This is some top secret shit

823
00:40:28.139 --> 00:40:30.216
that I should not be
showing you.

824
00:40:30.249 --> 00:40:31.661
Is it Botox?

825
00:40:31.694 --> 00:40:33.549
This is the vaccine.

826
00:40:35.081 --> 00:40:36.967
It's gonna heal the world.

827
00:40:37.001 --> 00:40:39.657
Total immunity to everything.

828
00:40:39.691 --> 00:40:40.691
Everything?

829
00:40:42.191 --> 00:40:47.021
Just one little shot
and nothing will ever stop you.

830
00:40:47.054 --> 00:40:48.582
Can I do it now?

831
00:40:48.616 --> 00:40:50.091
No.

832
00:40:50.124 --> 00:40:51.789
Oh.

833
00:40:51.823 --> 00:40:53.192
But.

834
00:40:53.226 --> 00:40:54.796
But?

835
00:40:54.829 --> 00:40:57.834
Seeing that we're already
like family

836
00:40:57.868 --> 00:41:00.872
and this is a momentous
occasion.

837
00:41:00.906 --> 00:41:02.697
it feels right
to make an exception.

838
00:41:05.579 --> 00:41:09.544
<i>Now. if an ageless billionaire
has pulled you into a wardrobe.</i>

839
00:41:09.578 --> 00:41:12.424
<i>inviting you to try
a secret serum in a syringe</i>

840
00:41:12.458 --> 00:41:14.344
<i>from a creepy wooden box...</i>

841
00:41:14.378 --> 00:41:16.781
You ready to be
an untouchable queen?

842
00:41:16.814 --> 00:41:17.709
<i>Just say...</i>

843
00:41:17.743 --> 00:41:18.669
Yes.

844
00:41:18.703 --> 00:41:19.882
Yes. please.

845
00:41:19.916 --> 00:41:22.478
<i>Wrong answer. sweetheart.</i>

846
00:41:22.511 --> 00:41:23.786
Hey. uh. thanks for the tour.

847
00:41:23.819 --> 00:41:25.991
but I should probably
be heading back.

848
00:41:26.024 --> 00:41:27.689
My sister
and my friends are probably

849
00:41:27.723 --> 00:41:28.744
wondering about me.

850
00:41:29.927 --> 00:41:31.086
Here we go.

851
00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.194
You haven't even met
Mr. Rektor yet.

852
00:41:37.228 --> 00:41:40.074
Oh. uh. oh. why. is he around?

853
00:42:26.567 --> 00:42:30.216
Welcome to the rest
of your life.

854
00:42:34.891 --> 00:42:36.334
No shit.

855
00:42:39.406 --> 00:42:42.442
I grew up pulling all-nighters
to watch re-runs of your show.

856
00:42:44.428 --> 00:42:46.504
<i>Catch a criminal
with Elliot Jones.</i>

857
00:42:46.538 --> 00:42:49.226
<i>If you're a criminal
preying on the innocent.</i>

858
00:42:49.259 --> 00:42:51.146
<i>if you assault. rape.
and kill...</i>

859
00:42:51.179 --> 00:42:52.106
<i>Aahhh!</i>

860
00:42:52.139 --> 00:42:53.836
<i>We have a message for you.</i>

861
00:42:53.869 --> 00:42:54.796
<i>Watch out.</i>

862
00:42:54.829 --> 00:42:56.906
<i>Justice is back in town.</i>

863
00:42:56.939 --> 00:42:59.849
<i>Ride alone with Elliot Jones

864
00:42:59.883 --> 00:43:02.539
<i>pursues.

867
00:43:07.689 --> 00:43:09.196
<i>Making america safer.</i>

868
00:43:13.196 --> 00:43:15.366
<i>Catch a criminal

869
00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:19.206
<i>Thursdays at-00.
- 00 central on bdn.</i>

870
00:43:26.793 --> 00:43:27.793
What happened to you?

871
00:43:33.703 --> 00:43:36.908
My daughter. Molly. she was...

872
00:43:38.503 --> 00:43:40.200
She was murdered
in the hotel suite

873
00:43:40.233 --> 00:43:41.930
of a record label executive.

874
00:43:44.812 --> 00:43:50.285
So... there was a trial.
highly publicized search

875
00:43:50.319 --> 00:43:52.901
for her killer
and all that bullshit.

876
00:43:52.935 --> 00:43:57.321
That's what led to setting
the whole show in motion.

877
00:43:57.355 --> 00:44:00.581
But it was all for her.
it was all for Molly.

878
00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:07.692
I followed every clue
until it led me to the...

879
00:44:09.613 --> 00:44:11.405
The owner of the record label.

880
00:44:11.439 --> 00:44:13.388
Hmm.

881
00:44:13.422 --> 00:44:19.560
Who also happened to be
the owner of the network

882
00:44:19.593 --> 00:44:21.733
that paid for my show.

883
00:44:21.766 --> 00:44:23.273
Steven rektor.

884
00:44:26.218 --> 00:44:28.421
Steven fucking rektor.

885
00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:33.643
This is our newest feature.

886
00:44:33.677 --> 00:44:36.133
personally designed
by Mr. Rektor himself.

887
00:44:36.166 --> 00:44:36.964
It's the latest

888
00:44:36.999 --> 00:44:39.593
in immersive
audio-visual experiences.

889
00:44:39.627 --> 00:44:41.165
What like vr?

890
00:44:41.199 --> 00:44:42.568
Like nothing you've ever seen.

891
00:44:46.473 --> 00:44:48.550
A lot of people think
that vampires is the stuff

892
00:44:48.583 --> 00:44:51.176
of fairy tales. and novels.
and all that bullshit.

893
00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:53.993
But little do they know
that bram stoker himself

894
00:44:54.027 --> 00:44:55.628
was a vampire!

895
00:44:55.662 --> 00:44:58.920
Making up lies to distract us
from the truth.

896
00:44:58.953 --> 00:45:02.981
That the vampire illuminati
not only walks among us.

897
00:45:03.015 --> 00:45:08.361
they've gamed our entire system.
our financial institutions.

898
00:45:08.395 --> 00:45:10.376
We got shadow governments
making up laws

899
00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:12.107
we don't even
fucking know about.

900
00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:15.303
Massive media mergers.
algorithms. data mining

901
00:45:15.337 --> 00:45:17.255
to control what people think.

902
00:45:17.288 --> 00:45:19.850
While the police state
keeps us in line.

903
00:45:20.748 --> 00:45:23.468
Now. we got a vaccine.

904
00:45:23.502 --> 00:45:25.895
Yeah. all in the name
of healing the world

905
00:45:25.928 --> 00:45:28.427
when it's really about keeping
our blood clean enough

906
00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:29.893
for their consumption.

907
00:45:29.926 --> 00:45:34.281
Rooting out the prey from
a super society of predators

908
00:45:34.315 --> 00:45:40.453
who worship at the altar
of a vampire illuminati.

909
00:45:40.486 --> 00:45:41.803
And that's the truth. baby.

910
00:45:44.559 --> 00:45:48.006
Okay so. I just lie there.

911
00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:50.855
Clothes on obviously. right.
No? Okay. I'm joking.

912
00:45:50.888 --> 00:45:51.941
Alright.

913
00:45:53.863 --> 00:45:55.085
Whoa. here we go.

914
00:45:58.990 --> 00:46:00.170
Have fun.

915
00:46:55.725 --> 00:46:56.725
Hello?

916
00:46:59.017 --> 00:47:00.017
Hello. Jack.

917
00:47:02.667 --> 00:47:03.783
Steven?

918
00:47:03.817 --> 00:47:05.576
Cocksuckers. hang on a second.

919
00:47:06.823 --> 00:47:08.488
Here we go.

920
00:47:08.522 --> 00:47:09.575
Here we go.

921
00:47:12.172 --> 00:47:13.383
The omega society.

922
00:47:13.417 --> 00:47:15.240
It's the oldest
and most secretive society

923
00:47:15.273 --> 00:47:17.065
on the planet.

924
00:47:17.098 --> 00:47:18.573
It's more of a cult really.

925
00:47:20.073 --> 00:47:22.730
Their origins date back
since before recorded history.

926
00:47:23.882 --> 00:47:24.935
Want a smoke?

927
00:47:24.968 --> 00:47:26.950
Uh. I... I vape.

928
00:47:26.983 --> 00:47:27.983
Grow up.

929
00:47:29.895 --> 00:47:34.925
Look. they lived off the blood
of small mammals until...

930
00:47:34.959 --> 00:47:38.090
Until they realized
that drinking human blood

931
00:47:38.123 --> 00:47:40.263
would give them immortal life.

932
00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:43.111
If they drank it often enough.

933
00:47:43.145 --> 00:47:45.000
But it wasn't long
until us humans

934
00:47:45.033 --> 00:47:46.635
started fighting back.

935
00:47:46.668 --> 00:47:47.499
By the middle ages.

936
00:47:47.533 --> 00:47:49.357
we had these motherfuckers
on the run.

937
00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:52.775
Then. they came up
with a new tactic.

938
00:47:52.808 --> 00:47:56.077
Fleeing their villages
in a mass migration.

939
00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:58.661
And then reintegrating
into our society.

940
00:47:58.695 --> 00:48:03.303
pretending... pretending.
mind you. to be one of us.

941
00:48:03.337 --> 00:48:04.780
But they're weak.

942
00:48:04.813 --> 00:48:06.637
They have a disease.

943
00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:10.118
The whole family
has had a disease for 350 years.

944
00:48:10.152 --> 00:48:12.460
And now rektor's dying.

945
00:48:12.493 --> 00:48:14.412
And he thinks you're the cure.

946
00:48:14.445 --> 00:48:15.755
What do you mean cure?

947
00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:18.220
Hunters way before me have been
documenting their kills

948
00:48:18.253 --> 00:48:19.749
for centuries.

949
00:48:19.782 --> 00:48:23.240
But there is one event
that changed everything.

950
00:48:23.274 --> 00:48:25.034
1627.

951
00:48:25.067 --> 00:48:27.144
During the würzberg
witch trials.

952
00:48:27.177 --> 00:48:30.309
a young woman.
a leper was prayed over

953
00:48:30.342 --> 00:48:33.769
by a powerful French cleric
Armand Jean du som...

954
00:48:33.802 --> 00:48:34.792
Something.

955
00:48:34.826 --> 00:48:36.965
Said to be touched by god
himself.

956
00:48:36.999 --> 00:48:38.442
Anyway. puts his hands on her.

957
00:48:38.476 --> 00:48:41.164
says a prayer. and boom.
she's healed.

958
00:48:41.198 --> 00:48:42.156
Just like that.

959
00:48:42.189 --> 00:48:43.276
True miracle.

960
00:48:43.309 --> 00:48:46.091
Well. she healed so fast.
they thought she was a witch.

961
00:48:46.124 --> 00:48:48.517
Decided to burn her at the stake

962
00:48:48.551 --> 00:48:51.175
but the night
before her execution.

963
00:48:51.209 --> 00:48:52.262
she had a visitor.

964
00:48:53.741 --> 00:48:56.746
A vampire patriarch
brutally drained her

965
00:48:56.779 --> 00:49:00.902
of every ounce of blood
in her frail body.

966
00:49:00.936 --> 00:49:06.282
But her blood...
It was special.

967
00:49:06.316 --> 00:49:08.772
Infused by
the holy spirit himself

968
00:49:08.805 --> 00:49:10.534
thanks to the cleric. you see.

969
00:49:10.567 --> 00:49:14.827
She was given the divine gift
of life.

970
00:49:14.861 --> 00:49:18.604
That will wreak havoc
on the dead.

971
00:49:18.638 --> 00:49:22.149
Her name was lost through time.
but she was forever referred to

972
00:49:22.182 --> 00:49:27.909
as the "geist des schicksals".
"the ghost of fate".

973
00:49:27.942 --> 00:49:30.504
And through the centuries.
that infected bloodline

974
00:49:30.537 --> 00:49:33.479
has run rampant
through the rektor family

975
00:49:33.512 --> 00:49:36.549
making each generation
shorter. and weaker.

976
00:49:36.582 --> 00:49:39.397
and more desperate
than the ones before.

977
00:49:39.431 --> 00:49:42.952
And now Steven rektor thinks
that you and Jack are the cure.

978
00:49:42.986 --> 00:49:44.134
Holy shit.

979
00:49:44.167 --> 00:49:46.085
And hell. I think they're right!

980
00:49:46.119 --> 00:49:49.092
My theory is that not only is
your blood the right type.

981
00:49:49.125 --> 00:49:51.402
but you and Jack have
rektor DNA.

982
00:49:51.436 --> 00:49:54.567
Your great grandpa
wilbur chambers

983
00:49:54.601 --> 00:49:59.589
married a Lydia riechtor.
which could have been rektor.

984
00:49:59.622 --> 00:50:01.255
Vampires are changing
their fucking names

985
00:50:01.289 --> 00:50:02.279
all the time.

986
00:50:02.312 --> 00:50:04.842
that's why they're after you.

987
00:50:04.876 --> 00:50:09.094
'Cause they think you and Jack
are part of the family.

988
00:50:09.127 --> 00:50:10.855
So. we gotta go now.

989
00:50:10.889 --> 00:50:12.364
We're not ready.
- Why not?

990
00:50:12.398 --> 00:50:13.862
We've gotta prepare.

991
00:50:13.896 --> 00:50:15.687
I thought that's what
we've been doing.

992
00:50:15.721 --> 00:50:17.892
I've been killing vamps
a long time. honey.

993
00:50:17.925 --> 00:50:21.162
Steven rektor.
that son of a bitch.

994
00:50:21.196 --> 00:50:22.353
he ain't no ordinary vampire.

995
00:50:22.377 --> 00:50:23.335
Nope.

996
00:50:23.369 --> 00:50:25.287
He's a dark lord.

997
00:50:25.321 --> 00:50:28.199
whose royal bloodline goes back
to the very beginning.

998
00:50:28.232 --> 00:50:29.960
Now. you take him out.

999
00:50:29.994 --> 00:50:32.112
you take out one of the biggest
vamp syndicates of all time.

1000
00:50:32.136 --> 00:50:34.507
I can't believe this is
my fucking life right now.

1001
00:50:34.541 --> 00:50:38.252
Okay. Rektor's birthday
as on record is 1921.

1002
00:50:39.626 --> 00:50:43.337
Now. a vampire's natural
lifespan is of course endless.

1003
00:50:43.371 --> 00:50:45.574
But no financial
or real estate records

1004
00:50:45.607 --> 00:50:47.947
ever show one vampire
ever living past

1005
00:50:47.981 --> 00:50:48.485
the century Mark.

1006
00:50:48.519 --> 00:50:50.152
What does that mean?

1007
00:50:50.186 --> 00:50:51.882
It means after 100 years.

1008
00:50:51.916 --> 00:50:54.920
they simply vanish
into thin air.

1009
00:50:54.954 --> 00:50:57.125
So you're saying that rektor
is near the...

1010
00:50:57.159 --> 00:50:59.045
Expiration date.

1011
00:50:59.079 --> 00:51:02.980
But he's also immortal.
so what does that mean?

1012
00:51:03.014 --> 00:51:06.440
Vampires age and die
just like you and me.

1013
00:51:06.474 --> 00:51:09.257
But their spirit never does.

1014
00:51:09.291 --> 00:51:12.454
They simply move on
to a new host.

1015
00:51:12.487 --> 00:51:14.279
Somebody they feel can carry on
their legacy.

1016
00:51:14.312 --> 00:51:16.294
Yup. yup. that's Jack.

1017
00:51:17.994 --> 00:51:19.237
I've been waiting for you.

1018
00:51:22.245 --> 00:51:23.467
Wow. man.

1019
00:51:23.501 --> 00:51:24.807
You look so...

1020
00:51:24.841 --> 00:51:25.830
Real.

1021
00:51:25.864 --> 00:51:27.687
Yeah.

1022
00:51:27.721 --> 00:51:29.259
What... and dude. this place.
it's...

1023
00:51:29.292 --> 00:51:30.757
It's ah...

1024
00:51:30.791 --> 00:51:33.194
You know. it's strange.
it kind of reminds me of. um...

1025
00:51:33.227 --> 00:51:34.439
Winston's bar and grill?

1026
00:51:35.981 --> 00:51:37.192
Yeah.

1027
00:51:37.226 --> 00:51:38.026
Dude.

1028
00:51:38.059 --> 00:51:39.112
Oh. yeah. no.

1029
00:51:39.146 --> 00:51:41.960
Man. I... I used to work here.

1030
00:51:41.994 --> 00:51:44.134
I mean not here.
you know the... the real one.

1031
00:51:44.167 --> 00:51:45.895
Not virtual. but...

1032
00:51:45.929 --> 00:51:47.720
Yeah. no. I... I was the dj.

1033
00:51:49.516 --> 00:51:51.655
I mean to be honest.
I was pretty fucking bad.

1034
00:51:52.873 --> 00:51:57.004
Umm. but this place is where
I made my first YouTube videos

1035
00:51:57.038 --> 00:51:57.732
with my roommate.

1036
00:51:57.765 --> 00:51:59.494
It's uh...

1037
00:51:59.527 --> 00:52:01.477
How did you know?

1038
00:52:01.511 --> 00:52:03.080
I know everything about you.

1039
00:52:03.114 --> 00:52:08.229
Your high school crush
to your first viral video.

1040
00:52:08.262 --> 00:52:11.140
The first million dollars
you ever made.

1041
00:52:11.174 --> 00:52:14.569
The day you met Liz
to the exact amount of money

1042
00:52:14.602 --> 00:52:17.417
in your checking account
right now.

1043
00:52:18.664 --> 00:52:20.455
Yeah. Oh. shit. uh...

1044
00:52:20.489 --> 00:52:23.367
You... about that.
umm. Mr. Rektor.

1045
00:52:23.401 --> 00:52:25.962
the reason that account
is so low is just because.

1046
00:52:25.996 --> 00:52:28.167
you know.
our overheads are so high.

1047
00:52:28.201 --> 00:52:30.340
Uh. but I can assure you
stream team's value

1048
00:52:30.374 --> 00:52:32.007
is still rocking high.

1049
00:52:32.041 --> 00:52:34.982
We don't care about all that.

1050
00:52:35.016 --> 00:52:37.830
Jack. everything you think
you know about the world.

1051
00:52:37.864 --> 00:52:40.520
it's all about to change.

1052
00:52:40.554 --> 00:52:43.147
You are about to change.

1053
00:52:43.181 --> 00:52:44.360
I am?

1054
00:52:44.394 --> 00:52:47.852
It's time for
your next evolutionary step.

1055
00:52:51.789 --> 00:52:53.349
Sorry. I...

1056
00:52:53.382 --> 00:52:54.889
I think I'm a bit confused.

1057
00:52:54.922 --> 00:52:58.476
Umm. when you say...
What do you mean...

1058
00:53:03.372 --> 00:53:06.314
Huh. what's going on?

1059
00:53:11.337 --> 00:53:12.337
Umm...

1060
00:53:17.066 --> 00:53:18.984
Hey guys. very funny.

1061
00:53:19.017 --> 00:53:20.872
I get it.

1062
00:53:20.906 --> 00:53:23.055
You know I thought this was
gonna be like a vr experience

1063
00:53:23.079 --> 00:53:25.924
on a beach.
you know or in space.

1064
00:53:25.958 --> 00:53:27.749
Something.

1065
00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:02.826
Can someone let me out of here.
please?

1066
00:54:04.326 --> 00:54:07.721
Oh. come on. okay.

1067
00:54:11.015 --> 00:54:13.355
Umm. okay. so. that was great.

1068
00:54:13.388 --> 00:54:15.876
I'm... I'm sorry. I...
I... I have to go.

1069
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:17.701
It was...
It was nice meeting you guys.

1070
00:54:17.735 --> 00:54:19.494
but umm. listen. I'm sorry.

1071
00:54:19.528 --> 00:54:21.573
I uh. I... I really gotta go.

1072
00:54:21.606 --> 00:54:22.533
You're not going anywhere.

1073
00:54:22.566 --> 00:54:23.428
Sorry. Jack.

1074
00:54:23.463 --> 00:54:25.444
No. no. it's cool.
No need to apologize.

1075
00:54:25.478 --> 00:54:27.111
I'm just gonna let myself out.

1076
00:54:27.145 --> 00:54:28.305
It was nice meeting you guys.

1077
00:54:29.350 --> 00:54:30.350
Liz?

1078
00:54:32.166 --> 00:54:33.219
Hi.

1079
00:54:34.983 --> 00:54:37.386
Baby. Oh. my god. baby.

1080
00:54:40.933 --> 00:54:41.933
Baby.

1081
00:54:43.401 --> 00:54:45.035
Are you okay?

1082
00:54:45.068 --> 00:54:46.691
Never better.

1083
00:54:46.724 --> 00:54:48.105
Baby. we... we... we gotta go.

1084
00:54:48.138 --> 00:54:49.835
- Now.
- No.

1085
00:54:49.868 --> 00:54:51.396
- Why?
- Why?

1086
00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:52.388
We made it. baby.

1087
00:54:52.421 --> 00:54:53.991
No. no. we didn't.

1088
00:54:54.025 --> 00:54:55.204
This place is a fucking trap.

1089
00:54:55.238 --> 00:54:56.745
Baby. we gotta go.

1090
00:54:56.778 --> 00:54:57.546
Kiss me.

1091
00:54:57.580 --> 00:54:58.506
Now?

1092
00:54:58.540 --> 00:54:59.909
Kiss me.

1093
00:54:59.943 --> 00:55:00.996
Oh. shit!

1094
00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:02.505
Oh. shit.
You're one of them.

1095
00:55:02.538 --> 00:55:03.971
Eternal life. Jack.

1096
00:55:04.004 --> 00:55:04.835
Think about it.

1097
00:55:04.869 --> 00:55:06.756
We have more money. power.
and success

1098
00:55:06.790 --> 00:55:08.170
than we ever imagined.

1099
00:55:08.203 --> 00:55:10.216
It's the holy grail. Jack.

1100
00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:12.611
No. no. no. I'm sorry.
this is not okay.

1101
00:55:12.644 --> 00:55:13.835
I can't...

1102
00:55:13.868 --> 00:55:15.755
We can't be like these people.

1103
00:55:15.788 --> 00:55:17.801
We just need to get you
to a hospital.

1104
00:55:17.835 --> 00:55:20.006
You know. there's still time.
We can reverse this.

1105
00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:22.633
-Oh. fuck fangs. oh. god.

1106
00:55:22.666 --> 00:55:23.666
Oh.

1107
00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:28.425
Ah.

1108
00:55:28.458 --> 00:55:29.511
Goodnight. Jack.

1109
00:55:48.776 --> 00:55:49.956
Let me out of here.

1110
00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:52.330
Oh. let's not be difficult here.

1111
00:55:52.363 --> 00:55:53.828
You should be grateful.

1112
00:55:53.861 --> 00:55:56.676
You're about to be a king.
and join the spirits

1113
00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:58.438
with the longest bloodline
in the world.

1114
00:56:00.423 --> 00:56:02.890
Please. I'm begging you.

1115
00:56:02.923 --> 00:56:03.913
There's been a mistake.

1116
00:56:03.946 --> 00:56:05.738
This isn't
what we signed up for.

1117
00:56:05.771 --> 00:56:06.890
Page six.

1118
00:56:06.923 --> 00:56:09.673
A full transference of all
of Steven and Beverly rektor's

1119
00:56:09.706 --> 00:56:12.131
assets. including their own
personal DNA.

1120
00:56:12.164 --> 00:56:14.473
You did read the contract.
correct?

1121
00:56:16.964 --> 00:56:20.296
Look. whatever you're planning.
just find someone else. okay?

1122
00:56:20.330 --> 00:56:23.493
I'm... I'm not gonna tell anyone.
I promise.

1123
00:56:23.526 --> 00:56:25.128
We don't want anyone.

1124
00:56:25.161 --> 00:56:27.143
We chose you.

1125
00:56:27.176 --> 00:56:29.865
Chose me for what?

1126
00:56:29.898 --> 00:56:31.974
Welcome to the family.

1127
00:56:32.008 --> 00:56:33.029
What. no!

1128
00:56:33.063 --> 00:56:35.498
No. please. No.

1129
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:44.328
Well. full transition.
less than an hour.

1130
00:56:44.361 --> 00:56:46.248
An hour?
I saw him like an hour ago.

1131
00:56:46.281 --> 00:56:47.893
That's why I'm saying
we should be going now.

1132
00:56:47.917 --> 00:56:51.048
These bastards are the most
vicious. the strongest.

1133
00:56:51.081 --> 00:56:54.149
fastest. most vile motherfuckers
on this planet.

1134
00:56:54.183 --> 00:56:56.650
The games are over. honey.

1135
00:56:56.683 --> 00:56:57.449
You walk in that house.

1136
00:56:57.483 --> 00:56:59.108
chances are
you'll get exsanguinated

1137
00:56:59.141 --> 00:57:01.513
in less than a minute
walking through the door.

1138
00:57:01.546 --> 00:57:02.505
Sounds fun.

1139
00:57:02.538 --> 00:57:04.804
Hey. I'm serious.

1140
00:57:04.838 --> 00:57:06.155
You gotta follow my lead.

1141
00:57:09.037 --> 00:57:10.477
Whatever it takes
to save my brother.

1142
00:57:13.161 --> 00:57:15.723
You know I always thought
I'd die alone.

1143
00:57:15.757 --> 00:57:17.197
It's nice to know
I got some company.

1144
00:57:20.557 --> 00:57:22.084
Always aim for the chest.

1145
00:57:22.118 --> 00:57:25.766
A wooden stake or a silver blade
through the heart.

1146
00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:28.330
are the only proven way
to kill these bastards.

1147
00:57:28.363 --> 00:57:30.524
How... how long have you been
killing these things for?

1148
00:57:32.077 --> 00:57:33.319
A long fucking time.

1149
00:57:33.353 --> 00:57:34.628
Come on.

1150
00:57:34.661 --> 00:57:37.866
Countermeasures.
always have 'em on you.

1151
00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:40.229
Crosses.
the fear of god slows 'em down.

1152
00:57:40.263 --> 00:57:42.149
But mine packs an extra punch.

1153
00:57:42.183 --> 00:57:43.299
Cute.

1154
00:57:43.333 --> 00:57:45.061
Holy water.

1155
00:57:45.095 --> 00:57:46.886
Only use this as a last resort

1156
00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:48.869
when shit really hits the fan.
okay?

1157
00:57:48.903 --> 00:57:52.488
And no self-respecting
vampire hunter

1158
00:57:52.521 --> 00:57:54.402
ever leaves home without
a pack of these babies.

1159
00:57:56.108 --> 00:57:58.596
Liquid garlic.

1160
00:57:58.630 --> 00:58:02.826
Explodes on contact
with any vamp scum.

1161
00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:04.746
Huh. vamp scum?

1162
00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:06.919
Yeah. What?

1163
00:58:06.953 --> 00:58:07.879
Nothing.

1164
00:58:07.913 --> 00:58:09.578
It's a cool nickname.

1165
00:58:09.611 --> 00:58:11.171
And last but sure as shit
not least.

1166
00:58:11.204 --> 00:58:12.933
there's the four-second rule.

1167
00:58:12.966 --> 00:58:14.799
Now. a typical vampire
just wants to drain your blood

1168
00:58:14.823 --> 00:58:17.353
and leave you for dead. right?

1169
00:58:17.386 --> 00:58:21.225
But if you get fangs in
with the dark lord or his ilk.

1170
00:58:21.258 --> 00:58:24.105
you got exactly
four mississippis to get 'em out

1171
00:58:24.138 --> 00:58:24.904
before you turn.

1172
00:58:24.938 --> 00:58:27.396
And if you do turn.
I got no choice.

1173
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:30.338
but to stake your ass
to the grave.

1174
00:58:30.372 --> 00:58:31.847
Ditto.

1175
00:58:33.283 --> 00:58:34.695
Fat chance. kid.

1176
00:58:37.419 --> 00:58:38.757
We're close.

1177
00:58:40.236 --> 00:58:42.470
Anything else I should know?

1178
00:58:42.504 --> 00:58:45.572
Yeah. yeah. there is.

1179
00:58:45.605 --> 00:58:48.040
We're gonna do everything we
can
to help your brother.

1180
00:58:48.074 --> 00:58:53.125
But there are thousands of lives
at stake here.

1181
00:58:53.159 --> 00:58:55.298
Now. we got three hours
till sunrise

1182
00:58:55.332 --> 00:58:57.259
and a lot of vampire ass to kick
between now and then.

1183
00:58:57.283 --> 00:59:00.868
So. are you ready?

1184
00:59:00.902 --> 00:59:03.590
Actually give me one second.

1185
00:59:03.624 --> 00:59:05.384
What the hell are you doing?

1186
00:59:05.417 --> 00:59:07.557
I may have missed
the semi-finals.

1187
00:59:07.590 --> 00:59:09.708
I'm gonna show the league
that I'm good enough to go pro.

1188
00:59:09.732 --> 00:59:11.397
You're filming this?

1189
00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:12.969
Got a problem with that?

1190
00:59:13.002 --> 00:59:13.929
Do I have a choice?

1191
00:59:13.962 --> 00:59:15.754
No. not really.

1192
00:59:15.787 --> 00:59:17.832
Alright. locked and loaded.

1193
01:00:24.359 --> 01:00:25.029
Holy crap. guys.

1194
01:00:25.063 --> 01:00:26.920
Flynn chambers is back on live.

1195
01:00:26.954 --> 01:00:28.072
Oh. my gosh.

1196
01:00:28.106 --> 01:00:30.792
And it looks like she's in
a secret bunker with her dad.

1197
01:00:30.825 --> 01:00:31.464
That's not her dad.

1198
01:00:31.498 --> 01:00:33.577
Her dad died three years ago.

1199
01:00:33.610 --> 01:00:35.750
Let's just say it.
her outfit's pretty badass.

1200
01:00:35.784 --> 01:00:36.878
She looks like she can kill.

1201
01:00:36.902 --> 01:00:38.282
And the whole bow
and arrow thing

1202
01:00:38.316 --> 01:00:40.234
is very fortnite 2019.

1203
01:00:40.267 --> 01:00:42.692
But she's bringing it back
and I'm here for it.

1204
01:00:42.725 --> 01:00:44.200
This stuff is
legit scary though.

1205
01:00:44.234 --> 01:00:45.730
We need to find out
who that guy is.

1206
01:00:45.763 --> 01:00:46.595
Yeah. for real.

1207
01:00:46.629 --> 01:00:48.420
That guy is mad sus.

1208
01:00:48.454 --> 01:00:49.938
Wait. look...
Looks like she's starting.

1209
01:00:49.962 --> 01:00:51.817
Shhh.

1210
01:01:10.154 --> 01:01:11.428
Whoa. whoa.

1211
01:01:11.462 --> 01:01:13.865
Easy here. ladies.

1212
01:01:13.899 --> 01:01:15.332
Easy. girls.

1213
01:01:15.365 --> 01:01:16.387
Easy now.

1214
01:01:24.902 --> 01:01:26.282
A little help here!

1215
01:01:37.192 --> 01:01:38.952
A little help here!

1216
01:01:53.702 --> 01:01:54.787
Oh.

1217
01:02:01.129 --> 01:02:02.857
Nice reflexes there. lady.

1218
01:02:02.890 --> 01:02:05.769
Fuck you very much.

1219
01:02:05.802 --> 01:02:07.172
Here.

1220
01:02:07.205 --> 01:02:08.997
Rektor's close.

1221
01:02:09.030 --> 01:02:11.012
I can feel it.

1222
01:02:11.045 --> 01:02:14.440
So when we find rektor.
how do we take him down?

1223
01:02:14.474 --> 01:02:18.723
Yeah. thanks for reminding me.

1224
01:02:18.757 --> 01:02:20.580
Are you fucking kidding me?

1225
01:02:20.614 --> 01:02:21.994
You insane?

1226
01:02:22.027 --> 01:02:23.945
When I said I'd alone.
I wasn't fucking.

1227
01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:32.807
There's no known way to kill
a dark lord or his queen.

1228
01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:34.822
I'm just looking for some way.
any way

1229
01:02:34.855 --> 01:02:36.552
to break the cycle
and in the transition

1230
01:02:36.585 --> 01:02:38.282
maybe save your brother.

1231
01:02:38.316 --> 01:02:39.653
Alright.

1232
01:02:39.687 --> 01:02:42.533
The simple fact is ain't nobody
ever done that

1233
01:02:42.567 --> 01:02:44.422
and lived to tell the tale.

1234
01:02:44.455 --> 01:02:47.882
<i>Nobody but nobody
in a thousand years</i>

1235
01:02:47.916 --> 01:02:49.897
<i>has ever successfully taken down
the leader</i>

1236
01:02:49.930 --> 01:02:51.177
<i>of a vampire syndicate.</i>

1237
01:02:51.211 --> 01:02:54.338
<i>In fact. there's only been
three documented attempts.</i>

1238
01:02:54.372 --> 01:02:58.505
<i>First. is none other than the
inspiration for Dracula himself.</i>

1239
01:02:58.539 --> 01:03:00.098
<i>Vlad the impaler.</i>

1240
01:03:00.132 --> 01:03:02.725
<i>A brutal leader who.
as legend has it.</i>

1241
01:03:02.759 --> 01:03:07.114
<i>dipped pieces of bread
in bowls of his victims' blood.</i>

1242
01:03:07.147 --> 01:03:09.667
<i>He staked their bodies
all over Eastern Europe.</i>

1243
01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:13.064
<i>But not documented.
vlad was almost defeated</i>

1244
01:03:13.097 --> 01:03:16.682
<i>by a bavarian goldsmith
named Syd the shylock.</i>

1245
01:03:16.716 --> 01:03:19.172
<i>Trapped vlad with the aid
of his cousin. Esther.</i>

1246
01:03:19.205 --> 01:03:20.419
<i>who well may be a whore.</i>

1247
01:03:20.454 --> 01:03:23.043
<i>And he fed him divine water
and garlic injections</i>

1248
01:03:23.077 --> 01:03:24.932
<i>for three weeks straight.</i>

1249
01:03:24.965 --> 01:03:27.495
<i>But one morning
when Syd left for town.</i>

1250
01:03:27.529 --> 01:03:29.257
<i>vlad seduced Esther.</i>

1251
01:03:29.290 --> 01:03:32.517
<i>with the promise
of a real apple.</i>

1252
01:03:32.550 --> 01:03:34.563
<i>It was very rare those days.</i>

1253
01:03:34.597 --> 01:03:36.904
<i>And that was the end of Syd
and Esther and the last time</i>

1254
01:03:36.938 --> 01:03:41.377
<i>anybody ever saw
or heard of vlad the impaler.</i>

1255
01:03:41.411 --> 01:03:43.688
<i>And then there's Jack the
ripper.</i>

1256
01:03:43.721 --> 01:03:44.910
<i>Most consider
the Welsh murderer.</i>

1257
01:03:44.934 --> 01:03:46.599
<i>the very first serial killer.</i>

1258
01:03:46.633 --> 01:03:49.543
<i>but while Scotland yard
was desperate to catch Jack.</i>

1259
01:03:49.576 --> 01:03:52.771
<i>one detective.
Frederick George abberline.</i>

1260
01:03:52.804 --> 01:03:54.248
<i>knew the truth.</i>

1261
01:03:54.281 --> 01:03:56.326
<i>Jack wasn't a serial killer.</i>

1262
01:03:56.359 --> 01:03:58.626
<i>He was the leader
of a Welsh vampire syndicate.</i>

1263
01:03:58.659 --> 01:04:00.873
<i>known as the blood prince.</i>

1264
01:04:02.562 --> 01:04:05.641
<i>And our friend Frederick almost
busted the entire ring.</i>

1265
01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:07.941
<i>Killed dozens of vamps
including several members</i>

1266
01:04:07.974 --> 01:04:09.734
<i>of Jack's own family.</i>

1267
01:04:09.768 --> 01:04:12.931
<i>But even with the most inventive
steampunk armory.</i>

1268
01:04:12.964 --> 01:04:14.724
<i>some of which
we still use today.</i>

1269
01:04:14.758 --> 01:04:17.541
<i>his tactics were no match
for the ripper.</i>

1270
01:04:17.574 --> 01:04:19.682
<i>The blood prince
seduced Frederick</i>

1271
01:04:19.716 --> 01:04:23.586
<i>with the one thing
the detective always wanted.</i>

1272
01:04:23.619 --> 01:04:25.474
<i>dental surgery.</i>

1273
01:04:25.508 --> 01:04:27.816
<i>Which brings us to the rektor's.</i>

1274
01:04:27.849 --> 01:04:32.036
<i>this creepy fucking bunker.
and our sorry asses.</i>

1275
01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:34.146
Yeah. well. I'm not down
for a suicide mission. bro.

1276
01:04:34.179 --> 01:04:35.042
Okay. you're gonna need
to give me something else

1277
01:04:35.076 --> 01:04:36.646
to work with.

1278
01:04:36.679 --> 01:04:38.692
According to the great prophecy.

1279
01:04:38.726 --> 01:04:40.771
there's one way to kill
a dark lord.

1280
01:04:40.804 --> 01:04:42.691
and that's for him to get fanged

1281
01:04:42.724 --> 01:04:45.001
by somebody
from his own blood order.

1282
01:04:45.035 --> 01:04:48.419
I.e. Somebody that he himself
converted.

1283
01:04:49.508 --> 01:04:52.681
That right there is just
downright impossible. honey.

1284
01:04:52.715 --> 01:04:54.021
There has to be another way.

1285
01:04:54.054 --> 01:04:56.679
Now. you find that out.

1286
01:04:57.894 --> 01:04:59.591
And you let me know. okay.

1287
01:05:04.962 --> 01:05:07.397
Our guests have arrived.

1288
01:05:07.431 --> 01:05:09.571
Rektor's bodyguard.

1289
01:05:09.604 --> 01:05:12.577
Might be the only one that knows
where your brother is now.

1290
01:05:12.611 --> 01:05:14.793
Hey buddy. how you doing?

1291
01:05:17.031 --> 01:05:18.179
More coming to your way.

1292
01:05:22.116 --> 01:05:23.749
<i>I bet you're wondering
why the big guy</i>

1293
01:05:23.783 --> 01:05:25.637
<i>didn't take us down?</i>

1294
01:05:25.671 --> 01:05:28.328
<i>Well. because he knows
and I know.</i>

1295
01:05:28.361 --> 01:05:29.762
<i>we're already dead.</i>

1296
01:05:31.368 --> 01:05:32.484
Alright.

1297
01:05:33.995 --> 01:05:35.554
Are you ready for this?

1298
01:05:35.588 --> 01:05:38.117
Because things are about to go
from mildly nightmarish

1299
01:05:38.151 --> 01:05:40.681
to completely batshit
fucking crazy.

1300
01:05:40.715 --> 01:05:41.609
Hmm?

1301
01:05:41.643 --> 01:05:43.593
What do you think.
they're waiting for us?

1302
01:05:43.626 --> 01:05:44.869
What the fuck do you think?

1303
01:05:47.076 --> 01:05:49.448
All the shit we do for family.

1304
01:06:24.938 --> 01:06:26.793
Oh. my god.

1305
01:06:26.826 --> 01:06:28.934
That's the worst thing
I've ever seen.

1306
01:06:28.968 --> 01:06:31.044
All that blood for one vampire?

1307
01:06:31.078 --> 01:06:32.289
Not just one.

1308
01:06:32.322 --> 01:06:34.209
You see all them tube feeders?

1309
01:06:34.242 --> 01:06:36.488
Means this vamp ring
is a lot bigger than I thought.

1310
01:06:38.853 --> 01:06:39.874
Come on.

1311
01:06:48.358 --> 01:06:50.023
Oh. my god.

1312
01:06:50.056 --> 01:06:51.457
- Looks like a...
- Trap.

1313
01:06:57.219 --> 01:06:58.694
Jack?

1314
01:06:58.728 --> 01:07:00.677
Jack. Jack. come on.

1315
01:07:00.711 --> 01:07:02.313
Jack. look.
Jack. you have to wake up.

1316
01:07:02.346 --> 01:07:03.494
Please. Jack?

1317
01:07:03.528 --> 01:07:05.161
Stop.

1318
01:07:07.336 --> 01:07:09.349
Mr. Jones.

1319
01:07:09.383 --> 01:07:10.183
Welcome to the party.

1320
01:07:10.216 --> 01:07:11.617
Hello. bitch.

1321
01:07:11.651 --> 01:07:12.936
Flynn.

1322
01:07:12.969 --> 01:07:15.362
Hey. where is he. vamp scum?

1323
01:07:15.396 --> 01:07:17.736
He's been waiting for you.

1324
01:07:17.769 --> 01:07:19.751
Where is he?

1325
01:07:21.736 --> 01:07:23.686
Oh. I'm sorry.
was that a question?

1326
01:07:23.719 --> 01:07:26.408
'Cause I thought you knew
everything about us.

1327
01:07:26.441 --> 01:07:27.441
Try me.

1328
01:07:34.986 --> 01:07:37.284
Jesus. fuck.

1329
01:07:37.318 --> 01:07:39.331
They've been hiding his decline
for years.

1330
01:07:39.364 --> 01:07:41.704
That's rektor?

1331
01:07:41.738 --> 01:07:42.981
Who did we speak to before?

1332
01:07:43.014 --> 01:07:44.774
Goddamn deepfake program.

1333
01:07:44.808 --> 01:07:46.473
Remember. trust nobody.

1334
01:07:46.506 --> 01:07:48.741
Believe nothing.

1335
01:07:48.774 --> 01:07:52.423
And this piece of shit.
it's been a long time coming.

1336
01:07:52.456 --> 01:07:55.524
you bloodsucking megalomaniac
shitfucker.

1337
01:07:55.558 --> 01:07:59.143
Now. huh. we meet at last.

1338
01:07:59.176 --> 01:08:00.546
Well. not exactly.

1339
01:08:06.023 --> 01:08:07.972
You missed them
by about an hour.

1340
01:08:08.006 --> 01:08:10.177
We did?

1341
01:08:10.211 --> 01:08:12.361
Beverly rektor
has safely transitioned

1342
01:08:12.395 --> 01:08:14.017
to her new host body.

1343
01:08:17.606 --> 01:08:19.746
What about this piece of shit?

1344
01:08:19.779 --> 01:08:22.214
Oh. well. Steven is somewhere
in transit.

1345
01:08:22.248 --> 01:08:24.482
as his host completes
his transfusion.

1346
01:08:26.499 --> 01:08:28.006
Once the royal blood is in.

1347
01:08:28.039 --> 01:08:31.107
it means the spirit can finally
bind the body.

1348
01:08:31.141 --> 01:08:33.703
It's the final step.

1349
01:08:33.736 --> 01:08:34.631
I'm sorry. darling.

1350
01:08:34.664 --> 01:08:35.664
No!

1351
01:08:37.956 --> 01:08:40.738
No fucking way.

1352
01:08:40.772 --> 01:08:43.428
He didn't know what he was
getting into. alright?

1353
01:08:43.462 --> 01:08:46.087
You can do whatever the hell
you want with her.

1354
01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:47.490
Stay the fuck away from
my brother.

1355
01:08:49.865 --> 01:08:51.973
Think they'll just kill
each other?

1356
01:08:52.007 --> 01:08:54.822
Have fun draining. Mr. Jones.

1357
01:08:54.855 --> 01:08:57.026
I'm gonna make sure the sister
stays in the family.

1358
01:08:57.957 --> 01:09:00.487
Holy shit.

1359
01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:02.407
They want you to be the liaison.

1360
01:09:04.518 --> 01:09:06.563
It's a half-vampire. half-human

1361
01:09:06.597 --> 01:09:09.475
bound to the do the bidding
of the king and queen. forever.

1362
01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:12.576
No.

1363
01:09:12.610 --> 01:09:13.610
That's not gonna happen.

1364
01:09:13.634 --> 01:09:15.973
I've always wanted to taste
someone's integrity.

1365
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:19.265
Bring it. vamp scum.

1366
01:09:29.415 --> 01:09:30.468
That was easy.

1367
01:09:47.845 --> 01:09:48.961
Jesus!

1368
01:10:11.972 --> 01:10:14.312
Get the hell off me.
you fucking vamp.

1369
01:10:23.302 --> 01:10:24.302
Die. bitch.

1370
01:10:30.918 --> 01:10:32.647
Did she?

1371
01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:33.765
Am I?

1372
01:10:33.798 --> 01:10:35.716
Nah. you're good.

1373
01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:46.656
Alright.
let's shut this shit down.

1374
01:10:46.690 --> 01:10:47.690
Shall we?

1375
01:10:49.412 --> 01:10:51.330
I'm sorry. guys.

1376
01:10:51.363 --> 01:10:54.305
He's mine now.

1377
01:10:54.338 --> 01:10:56.773
Don't listen to her.
She's a queen now.

1378
01:10:56.807 --> 01:10:57.796
Not her true self.

1379
01:10:57.830 --> 01:10:59.938
No. no. that's Liz.

1380
01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:04.200
I'm gonna gut this bitch
once and for all.

1381
01:11:04.234 --> 01:11:06.468
Oh. sweetie. try me.

1382
01:11:15.363 --> 01:11:16.838
A little help here!

1383
01:11:18.823 --> 01:11:20.583
No!

1384
01:12:07.847 --> 01:12:09.058
Flynn!

1385
01:12:09.092 --> 01:12:11.527
Fucking queen.
don't let her get away!

1386
01:12:56.258 --> 01:12:57.679
- Press the blood.
- - Where's the button?

1387
01:12:57.703 --> 01:12:58.946
Press the fucking blood.

1388
01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:00.487
Aahh...

1389
01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:01.826
<i>The plan is not exactly simple.</i>

1390
01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:03.746
<i>Feeding rektor back
his own royal blood</i>

1391
01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:04.738
<i>takes a lot of steps.</i>

1392
01:13:04.773 --> 01:13:05.868
<i>So. to make it clear.
for all you</i>

1393
01:13:05.892 --> 01:13:09.348
<i>youtubing. tiktoking
cocksuckers out there.</i>

1394
01:13:09.382 --> 01:13:10.382
<i>here are some tips.</i>

1395
01:14:05.314 --> 01:14:06.662
Aaah! Help.

1396
01:14:06.696 --> 01:14:08.519
Oh. my god. Flynn.

1397
01:14:09.924 --> 01:14:11.113
Please get me out of this thing.

1398
01:14:11.137 --> 01:14:12.739
Come on.

1399
01:14:12.772 --> 01:14:15.872
Look.

1400
01:14:15.906 --> 01:14:17.286
Oh. god.

1401
01:14:25.126 --> 01:14:26.917
<i>Ah. you thought I forgot.</i>

1402
01:14:26.951 --> 01:14:29.090
<i>So. the third
and perhaps the closest.</i>

1403
01:14:29.124 --> 01:14:31.559
<i>anybody's ever come
to busting a syndicate</i>

of November 24th in 1971.</i>

01:14:36.519 --> 01:14:39.302
<i>A charismatic vamp
posing as an ad man</i>

1406
01:14:39.336 --> 01:14:41.317

to manipulating the masses</i>

01:14:41.351 --> 01:14:43.617
<i>through Madison Avenue
and forming a movement</i>

1408

01:14:49.062 --> 01:14:51.909
<i>But on his way to triumph.
he was double crossed</i>

1411
01:14:51.942 --> 01:14:53.061
<i>by a royal member</i>

1412
01:14:53.094 --> 01:14:55.717
<i>who was determined to use

<i>for a long time dream

1414
01:14:58.916 --> 01:15:02.047
<i>She sold out the ad man

from Portland to Seattle.</i>

I'm so sorry. you were right.

1423
01:15:22.947 --> 01:15:24.422
You were right about all of it.

1424
01:15:24.456 --> 01:15:25.477
I know. what else is new?

1425
01:15:26.597 --> 01:15:27.850
Please get me out of this thing.

1426
01:15:27.874 --> 01:15:30.182

01:15:30.216 --> 01:15:32.450
Oh. my god.

1428
01:15:32.484 --> 01:15:34.086
- Are we too late?
- Oh. yeah.

1429
01:15:34.119 --> 01:15:36.385
Listen. you did
a pretty good job.

1430
01:15:36.419 --> 01:15:37.504
- Yeah.
- What about this?

1431
01:15:37.537 --> 01:15:38.537
Oh. yeah.

1432
01:15:42.759 --> 01:15:44.880
You got three minutes to get
your brother out of here.

1433
01:15:47.042 --> 01:15:49.351
Hey. it was pretty fun.
wasn't it?

1434
01:15:49.384 --> 01:15:50.817
Huh?

1435
01:15:50.851 --> 01:15:52.547
Not really.

1436
01:15:52.581 --> 01:15:53.581
It's alright.

1437
01:15:55.651 --> 01:15:58.181
Let's go.
It was nice meeting you again.

1438
01:15:58.214 --> 01:16:01.314
Hey. remember. trust nobody.

1439
01:16:03.109 --> 01:16:04.869
Believe nothing.

I know a lot of you
have questions.

1493
01:20:27.235 --> 01:20:28.678
I definitely do.

1494
01:20:28.712 --> 01:20:31.199
Like is this a new promo
for a new vampire movie?

1495
01:20:31.233 --> 01:20:33.510
If it's so. what's the name?

1496
01:20:33.543 --> 01:20:35.430
And I guess Jules finally
quit the business.

1497
01:20:36.392 --> 01:20:37.961
And when is Liz's new nail kit
coming out?

1498
01:20:37.985 --> 01:20:40.388
'Cause this bitch
definitely needs it.

1499
01:20:40.421 --> 01:20:41.742
Sophie.
what's our news for today?

1500
01:20:44.103 --> 01:20:46.053
Okay. guys. so I listen to mpr

1501
01:20:46.086 --> 01:20:49.281
and basically. everyone went
missing from the compound.

1502
01:20:49.315 --> 01:20:52.161
And there are serious reports
of foul play.

1503
01:20:52.195 --> 01:20:53.606
What's mpr. girl?

1504
01:20:54.948 --> 01:20:56.001
Idiot.

1505
01:20:57.860 --> 01:20:59.588
So today our plan
is to look back

1506
01:20:59.621 --> 01:21:01.919
from the live streams and posts
from the past few days.

1507
01:21:01.953 --> 01:21:02.953
But before we do that.

1508
01:21:02.977 --> 01:21:06.688
I gotta give a big shout-out
to our sponsor. lit.

1509
01:21:06.721 --> 01:21:09.990
It's a new deodorant
for dudes like me and you.

1510
01:21:10.023 --> 01:21:12.163
Also don't forget to subscribe.

1511
01:21:12.196 --> 01:21:14.083
What about my sweatshirt
sponsorship?

1512
01:21:14.116 --> 01:21:15.211
- No one cares about that.
- No one cares.

1513
01:21:15.235 --> 01:21:17.026
But... but this.
