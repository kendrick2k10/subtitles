RICH IN LOVE 2

4
00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:27.333
-Hi! Have you seen Teto?
-Upstairs.

5
00:00:27.416 --> 00:00:28.500
Thank you.

6
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.333
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:38.583
TOMATO CO-OP REVOLUTIONIZE
THE ECONOMY OF RIO COMMUNITIES

8
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.000
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

9
00:00:43.041 --> 00:00:48.125
I’ve never learned to say goodbye

10
00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:53.500
I don't know if I'll ever get used to it

11
00:00:54.083 --> 00:00:55.208
Really. Teto?

12
00:00:55.291 --> 00:00:59.291
Looking into your eyes

13
00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:02.083
I know your gaze

14
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:06.083
Will forever be with me

15
00:01:07.708 --> 00:01:11.166
I've never learned to say goodbye

16
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.083
Get down!

17
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:14.083
-But I'll let you go
-But I'll let you go

18
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:17.333
-With no tears in my eyes
-With no tears in my eyes

19
00:01:17.416 --> 00:01:20.666
-If saying goodbye hurts me
-If saying goodbye hurts me

20
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.791
-Winter will pass
-Winter will pass

21
00:01:24.875 --> 00:01:25.875
You guys!

22
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.625
-And erase my scars
-And erase my scars

23
00:01:30.708 --> 00:01:31.666
You're one of a kind.

24
00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:35.500
Please stay.

25
00:01:36.708 --> 00:01:39.583
No way my favorite doctor is going away.

26
00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:42.125
I'll miss you a lot. too. Monique.

27
00:01:42.208 --> 00:01:45.000
-Good luck in the Amazon.
-Thanks. Igor.

28
00:01:45.083 --> 00:01:46.625
-Hey! Alana!
-Hey! Come here.

29
00:01:46.708 --> 00:01:49.541
-Hi. Paula.
-Mommy's here.

30
00:01:49.625 --> 00:01:51.125
Mommy…

31
00:01:51.208 --> 00:01:55.708
Mommy can't understand
why we can't have a regular office

32
00:01:55.791 --> 00:01:58.166
with an elevator. air conditioning.

33
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.958
This sacrifice isn't worth
the little we make at Teto Fresco.

34
00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:03.958
And there's nothing fresh about it.

35
00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:05.500
But we're growing.

36
00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:08.375
-Sure.
-It'll make a profit in no time.

37
00:02:08.458 --> 00:02:11.000
I'll keep our baby in my womb
for five more years

38
00:02:11.083 --> 00:02:12.916
until we have money for daycare!

39
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.458
I told you to put an escalator here.
but you vetoed it.

40
00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:18.500
I'd even put a panoramic elevator.

41
00:02:18.583 --> 00:02:20.541
-A cable car would be cool.
-A cable car!

42
00:02:20.625 --> 00:02:24.291
We'll think about this cable car
while you rub my feet.

43
00:02:24.375 --> 00:02:27.208
It was good to have you around
to knock some sense into Teto.

44
00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:29.375
Girl. you do that better than I do.

45
00:02:29.458 --> 00:02:32.500
No more educating a spoiled brat.
Take me with you.

46
00:02:32.583 --> 00:02:35.166
-Can I become a doctor?
-Sure. It's super quick.

47
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.875
-Let me get to work.
-That's harsh.

48
00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.625
-Yeah.
-That's right.

49
00:02:38.708 --> 00:02:40.250
I'll miss you so much.

50
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:41.875
Your surprises.

51
00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:45.250
I'll stay here abandoned and alone.

52
00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:46.291
-God…
-It's my fate.

53
00:02:46.375 --> 00:02:48.666
I have to go. It's important to me.

54
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.375
I know.
but does it have to be in the Amazon?

55
00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:56.916
-Yes. We have a lot to do there.
-We… You and Dr. Tawan. right?

56
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.666
-Teto! Don't start it.
-I was just joking.

57
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.583
You say so many good things
about Dr. Tawan

58
00:03:03.666 --> 00:03:07.166
that I'm glad you're taking him
to meet my father.

59
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.250
-Me too.
-Are you?

60
00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:09.166
Yep.

61
00:03:14.583 --> 00:03:18.375
Dr. Tawan set up the first health clinic
in Porto Remanso. Rio Negro.

62
00:03:18.458 --> 00:03:21.083
I learned about this project in college.
I was amazed.

63
00:03:21.166 --> 00:03:23.416
It was what I wanted to do.

64
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.208
-It's an honor to have you.
-Likewise.

65
00:03:25.291 --> 00:03:27.166
The project is really great.

66
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.208
The whole project is. but tell me.

67
00:03:30.291 --> 00:03:33.500
What if we take this wonderful project
to other places?

68
00:03:34.083 --> 00:03:36.541
-How so?
-Tell them. Dad.

69
00:03:36.625 --> 00:03:41.583
Well. I was impressed
when Teto told me about your work.

70
00:03:41.666 --> 00:03:44.625
-and he gave me an idea.
-It was your idea.

71
00:03:44.708 --> 00:03:46.583
-What idea?
-Tell them about it. Dad.

72
00:03:47.875 --> 00:03:51.875
The idea is to hire you to set up
a similar program

73
00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:56.541
nearby in Paty do Alferes.
sponsored by Trancoso Tomatoes. of course.

74
00:03:56.625 --> 00:03:58.541
Take it as a birthday present.

75
00:03:58.625 --> 00:04:01.750
It's not my birthday yet.
This isn't about us. Teto.

76
00:04:01.833 --> 00:04:03.916
It'd be great to work in Paty do Alferes.

77
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.333
and use your help.

78
00:04:05.416 --> 00:04:09.625
but now we need support
to work in the Amazon.

79
00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:11.875
I already explained this to him.
right. Teto?

80
00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:15.375
I know. but you said
you wanted to take care of people.

81
00:04:15.458 --> 00:04:19.083
-There are people here too.
-I know someone who can help you there.

82
00:04:19.166 --> 00:04:21.125
-What?
-Everaldo Coimbra.

83
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.083
Everaldo was my dad's assistant
at our farm.

84
00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:29.583
Now he's the largest tomato producer
in the north of Brazil. EverNorte.

85
00:04:29.666 --> 00:04:31.625
Excuse me. I don't know him. Who is he?

86
00:04:31.708 --> 00:04:34.041
You won't remember him.
You were tiny when he left.

87
00:04:34.125 --> 00:04:36.291
Do you think he'd sponsor us?

88
00:04:36.375 --> 00:04:38.750
I do. He's rich and has no competitors.

89
00:04:38.833 --> 00:04:41.208
He's selling tomatoes at gold prices.

90
00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:42.500
-It's a good idea.
-Yeah.

91
00:04:42.583 --> 00:04:43.625
Good.

92
00:04:46.416 --> 00:04:47.708
What about us?

93
00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:53.333
I'm gonna miss you so much.

94
00:04:56.875 --> 00:04:59.125
But we've been apart before.

95
00:04:59.791 --> 00:05:01.541
We'll figure it out.

96
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:03.833
I'll call you.

97
00:05:04.458 --> 00:05:07.125
You can call me when you miss me.

98
00:05:12.708 --> 00:05:13.833
It'll be fine.

99
00:05:13.916 --> 00:05:15.083
It will.

100
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.916
Wake up. Teto!

101
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.250
Are you okay. dude?

102
00:05:25.333 --> 00:05:27.333
-It's a mess in there.
-Jeez!

103
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.583
Have you taken a shower since Paula left?

104
00:05:31.541 --> 00:05:33.375
Hi. Paula. It's me again.

105
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.833
I'm trying to reach you. again.

106
00:05:35.916 --> 00:05:37.750
-Go over there!
-Are you okay?

107
00:05:37.833 --> 00:05:40.791
Come on! Your dad's here.
and he wants to meet at Trancoso.

108
00:05:40.875 --> 00:05:45.875
You could ask your dad to increase
the price Trancoso pays for our tomatoes.

109
00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.333
-We need it.
-Come on.

110
00:05:48.125 --> 00:05:48.958
Come on. let's go.

111
00:05:49.041 --> 00:05:51.083
Unfortunately. Trancoso Tomatoes

112
00:05:51.166 --> 00:05:53.375
isn't renewing
the contract with Teto Fresco.

113
00:05:53.458 --> 00:05:56.708
-Dad. don't do this to me!
-It was the shareholders' decision.

114
00:05:56.791 --> 00:05:58.916
We have enough tomatoes for our sauce.

115
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.333
Tell them that buying our tomatoes
is good for the company's image.

116
00:06:02.416 --> 00:06:03.708
It's over. Teto.

117
00:06:03.791 --> 00:06:07.708
Your job is really great.
But you're not Trancoso's CEO.

118
00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:10.708
This position has been waiting for you
since your grandpa died.

119
00:06:10.791 --> 00:06:14.541
Get your act together.
Teto Fresco will never make real money.

120
00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:17.458
The Southeast is saturated with tomatoes.

121
00:06:17.541 --> 00:06:19.625
The more you plant it.
the less it's worth.

122
00:06:19.708 --> 00:06:23.250
Okay! That Amazon guy you mentioned.
the EverNorte guy.

123
00:06:24.166 --> 00:06:26.458
How much does he make per tomato?

124
00:06:38.458 --> 00:06:41.958
Drink lots of water. sleep well.
and take this medicine.

125
00:06:42.041 --> 00:06:43.875
If you need anything. I'm here.

126
00:06:44.625 --> 00:06:46.416
-Good night. you guys.
-Good night.

127
00:06:54.166 --> 00:06:55.500
MISSED CALL
TETO

128
00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:57.708
What's up?

129
00:06:57.791 --> 00:06:59.166
How was your day?

130
00:07:00.708 --> 00:07:01.958
Same as usual.

131
00:07:02.041 --> 00:07:05.125
More patients with those strange symptoms.

132
00:07:05.208 --> 00:07:06.833
-Yeah. right?
-Yeah.

133
00:07:06.916 --> 00:07:08.750
Do you know what else is strange?

134
00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.166
You being here this late.

135
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.125
You need some rest. Paula.

136
00:07:14.208 --> 00:07:15.250
Especially today.

137
00:07:15.333 --> 00:07:16.916
-Surprise!
-Surprise!

138
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.750
-I can't believe it! You made this for me?
-Happy birthday!

139
00:07:19.833 --> 00:07:22.666
-Yes. Dr. Paula. Happy birthday.
-I'll make a wish.

140
00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.375
Cheers to life!

141
00:07:26.583 --> 00:07:28.333
-Come out. Dr. Paula!
-Is that Teto?

142
00:07:28.416 --> 00:07:29.791
-It is. right?
-Come out. babe!

143
00:07:29.875 --> 00:07:31.375
-That's Teto.
-I think so.

144
00:07:31.458 --> 00:07:32.708
I love you!

145
00:07:32.791 --> 00:07:33.916
Her boyfriend.

146
00:07:34.708 --> 00:07:36.375
Nilza. can you put the cake away?

147
00:07:37.625 --> 00:07:39.958
Happy birthday!

148
00:07:40.041 --> 00:07:41.541
Happy birthday. my love!

149
00:07:50.458 --> 00:07:52.541
Watch out for the birthday girl!

150
00:07:55.916 --> 00:07:58.500
-Happy birthday. Dr. Paula!
-Thanks!

151
00:07:59.041 --> 00:08:01.208
-Happy birthday! All the best.
-Thanks.

152
00:08:01.916 --> 00:08:03.041
Thank you!

153
00:08:03.125 --> 00:08:05.250
Teto. what's this?

154
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.583
A surprise.

155
00:08:09.375 --> 00:08:12.791
Darling. that's a clinic.
There are sick people there.

156
00:08:13.416 --> 00:08:16.125
Of course. Sorry.

157
00:08:17.166 --> 00:08:19.250
-Done.
-So many more patients.

158
00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:21.875
-Everyone's stressed out. Chaotic.
-Look.

159
00:08:22.416 --> 00:08:25.625
You need to relax to do your work.

160
00:08:26.666 --> 00:08:28.000
Have some fun.

161
00:08:28.583 --> 00:08:30.333
Guess who is gonna help you with that?

162
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.500
-Me.
-Come on. Teto.

163
00:08:34.083 --> 00:08:36.250
I'm bringing Teto Fresco here.

164
00:08:37.333 --> 00:08:39.125
So that I can be close to you.

165
00:08:39.208 --> 00:08:42.125
-You're bringing Teto Fresco here?
-Yes.

166
00:08:42.208 --> 00:08:43.208
Excuse me.

167
00:08:43.291 --> 00:08:44.750
-What's up. Teto?
-Hey!

168
00:08:45.333 --> 00:08:47.458
There's an emergency.

169
00:08:48.041 --> 00:08:49.250
I've got to go.

170
00:08:53.208 --> 00:08:56.791
Here. There is some plaque.

171
00:08:56.875 --> 00:08:58.291
This one too. doctor.

172
00:08:59.333 --> 00:09:01.166
I'll check his blood pressure.

173
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:02.958
Is it hard to breathe. Mr. Manoel?

174
00:09:03.041 --> 00:09:04.666
-Yes.
-Yes?

175
00:09:05.166 --> 00:09:06.208
Take a deep breath.

176
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.333
-Are you nauseous? Vomiting?
-Yes.

177
00:09:09.416 --> 00:09:12.833
-Where have you been?
-You'd better be quiet. son.

178
00:09:12.916 --> 00:09:14.750
He needs to rest. doctor.

179
00:09:17.375 --> 00:09:19.041
Low blood pressure here too.

180
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.666
The kid was going to say something.

181
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:24.375
-That was weird.
-Too weird.

182
00:09:24.458 --> 00:09:27.291
Excuse me. Stop talking about work.

183
00:09:27.375 --> 00:09:30.333
-It's time for you to relax.
-That's right.

184
00:09:30.416 --> 00:09:32.291
We have a long trip tomorrow.

185
00:09:32.875 --> 00:09:34.000
Sounds good.

186
00:09:34.083 --> 00:09:35.500
-Good night.
-Good night.

187
00:09:35.583 --> 00:09:36.708
THE KAKYDAN PROJECT

188
00:09:37.833 --> 00:09:41.000
-Are you traveling tomorrow?
-I didn't have time to tell you.

189
00:09:41.083 --> 00:09:44.083
We'll help Indigenous communities now.

190
00:09:44.166 --> 00:09:46.500
-Many people are getting sick there.
-Tomorrow?

191
00:09:47.833 --> 00:09:48.833
I just got here.

192
00:09:49.416 --> 00:09:50.833
I didn't know you were coming.

193
00:09:50.916 --> 00:09:55.250
-Sorry. but I've tried to reach you.
-I've been really busy. it's hard.

194
00:09:55.333 --> 00:09:58.833
I came here to make things easier.
But you don't seem happy.

195
00:09:58.916 --> 00:10:01.541
Of course I am. It's not that. I'm happy.

196
00:10:01.625 --> 00:10:05.625
I'd love to be with you.
But it's my job. What can I do?

197
00:10:05.708 --> 00:10:08.000
I believe in this project.
I'll go anywhere.

198
00:10:08.083 --> 00:10:09.916
You'll go wherever Dr. "Big Shot" wants.

199
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.625
I just got here. and he's taking you away.

200
00:10:12.708 --> 00:10:15.958
This has nothing to do with you.
It was already set up.

201
00:10:16.041 --> 00:10:16.958
Okay.

202
00:10:17.916 --> 00:10:20.208
-Fine.
-Let's go inside.

203
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:21.916
Sure.

204
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.833
Come in.

205
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.083
Do you sleep here?

206
00:10:31.166 --> 00:10:32.708
It's my birthday today.

207
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.416
I don't want to waste time arguing.

208
00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.416
Happiness is so simple.

209
00:10:41.375 --> 00:10:42.750
We make it complicated.

210
00:11:32.375 --> 00:11:34.458
-Morning. Mr. Everaldo.
-Don't call me mister.

211
00:11:35.041 --> 00:11:36.625
I carried you as a baby.

212
00:11:36.708 --> 00:11:40.333
First. I want to thank you
for supporting Paula's project.

213
00:11:40.416 --> 00:11:42.208
I'm glad I can help.

214
00:11:42.791 --> 00:11:45.541
Call me when you come
to see your girlfriend.

215
00:11:45.625 --> 00:11:49.208
I'm here now. I'm setting up
the company in Porto Remanso.

216
00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:51.000
Are you planting tomatoes here?

217
00:11:51.083 --> 00:11:54.041
I'm not sure if you heard of Teto Fresco.
It's a co-op.

218
00:11:54.125 --> 00:11:55.375
A co-op?

219
00:11:56.833 --> 00:11:57.666
Yeah. right.

220
00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:01.625
It's easy to not think of profits
when you get things easily.

221
00:12:01.708 --> 00:12:04.750
Everaldo. I'm calling you
to ask for a favor.

222
00:12:04.833 --> 00:12:08.791
I just got here. and they transferred her
to an Indigenous community.

223
00:12:08.875 --> 00:12:12.375
I'd like to know if you could
use your sponsor's prestige

224
00:12:12.458 --> 00:12:14.458
and help me keep her here.

225
00:12:14.541 --> 00:12:17.041
Now you're talking just like a Trancoso.

226
00:12:17.125 --> 00:12:19.458
-I'm thinking about what's best for her.
-Of course.

227
00:12:19.541 --> 00:12:23.041
Unfortunately. there's nothing I can do.

228
00:12:24.083 --> 00:12:26.708
Dr. Tawan is in charge of this project.

229
00:12:27.666 --> 00:12:29.458
He has full autonomy.

230
00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:31.041
But don't you think you could…?

231
00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:33.583
-Teto Fresco? Is this boat ours?
-Jeez!

232
00:12:33.666 --> 00:12:36.166
Everaldo. I have to hang up.
I'll call you later.

233
00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:37.791
Thank you for your time.

234
00:12:40.541 --> 00:12:41.375
Damn…

235
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.000
-Where is he?
-Over there.

236
00:12:46.083 --> 00:12:49.125
You're here! My darlings!

237
00:12:49.208 --> 00:12:50.250
Are you crazy?

238
00:12:50.333 --> 00:12:51.333
Why?

239
00:12:51.416 --> 00:12:55.625
We leave you alone for a day.
and you rent this thing? With a jet ski?

240
00:12:55.708 --> 00:12:58.291
I didn't rent it. It was worth buying it.

241
00:12:58.375 --> 00:12:59.833
Couldn't you have asked us?

242
00:12:59.916 --> 00:13:02.666
You didn't think of maintenance
and fuel costs.

243
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:06.416
Fuel?
This will help us promote Teto Fresco.

244
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.958
You must think outside the box
and take risks.

245
00:13:09.041 --> 00:13:12.041
Jumping is easy for you.
You're the only one with a parachute.

246
00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:13.375
Gold jewelry?

247
00:13:13.458 --> 00:13:16.583
You won't sell them a thing.
They're stingy.

248
00:13:16.666 --> 00:13:17.666
You can go. okay?

249
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:19.333
-Guys. I've missed you!
-Look!

250
00:13:19.416 --> 00:13:21.625
I couldn't believe it when Teto told me.

251
00:13:21.708 --> 00:13:23.250
-I missed you.
-You okay?

252
00:13:23.333 --> 00:13:24.500
-How are you?
-Hi.

253
00:13:25.541 --> 00:13:26.416
-Morning!
-Morning.

254
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.500
I'm happy to see you.
but I want to kill someone.

255
00:13:29.583 --> 00:13:31.041
I'm sure he deserves it.

256
00:13:31.625 --> 00:13:35.041
Have a good day at work.
I gotta pack. I'm traveling today.

257
00:13:35.125 --> 00:13:37.875
By the way. my boat leaves at five.

258
00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:41.041
What can I do?
I'll come to say goodbye to you.

259
00:13:42.416 --> 00:13:43.291
Again.

260
00:13:44.541 --> 00:13:48.166
Now I want to introduce to you
the floating Teto Fresco.

261
00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:50.708
-So cool.
-What about this jet ski. huh?

262
00:13:50.791 --> 00:13:54.166
-You like it. right?
-So I'm the minority here. right?

263
00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.250
You like it too.
Don't you want to ride it?

264
00:13:57.333 --> 00:14:01.000
FISH AND FRUIT MARKET RIBEIRINHA

265
00:14:01.083 --> 00:14:04.083
Good morning.
Would you sign our manifesto?

266
00:14:04.166 --> 00:14:05.583
SUSTAINABLE PREMIUM TOMATOES

267
00:14:05.666 --> 00:14:07.375
It's to fight illegal mining.

268
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.458
Can you sign our manifesto?

269
00:14:11.375 --> 00:14:12.250
Guys.

270
00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:15.083
-Attention. please.
-Hi!

271
00:14:15.166 --> 00:14:16.791
Please come around.

272
00:14:17.875 --> 00:14:22.208
We're bringing our co-op model
to Porto Remanso.

273
00:14:22.291 --> 00:14:25.208
Each of you can produce at your own home.

274
00:14:25.291 --> 00:14:29.791
Teto Fresco will help with technology.
production. and sales.

275
00:14:29.875 --> 00:14:33.083
Here you'll grow premium tomatoes.

276
00:14:33.166 --> 00:14:34.666
The best tomato ever.

277
00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.958
A real evolution
of this wonderful Italian fruit.

278
00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:40.500
-Sir.
-Yes?

279
00:14:41.083 --> 00:14:43.708
-Here.
-Tomatoes didn't come from Italy.

280
00:14:44.583 --> 00:14:45.500
What?

281
00:14:45.583 --> 00:14:48.000
There were tomatoes here
before the Europeans arrived.

282
00:14:48.083 --> 00:14:50.250
Tomatoes first appeared when Makunaima

283
00:14:50.333 --> 00:14:53.833
knocked down the Wazaká tree
and scattered its fruits around the Earth.

284
00:14:53.916 --> 00:14:55.458
Cool. Try the premium tomato.

285
00:14:55.541 --> 00:14:58.291
-I'm sure you'll like it.
-No. thanks.

286
00:14:58.375 --> 00:15:01.000
The best tomato I've eaten
is from my land.

287
00:15:01.083 --> 00:15:03.875
It's golden. And it's sweet. too.

288
00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:08.208
-Golden?
-Guys. come closer.

289
00:15:08.291 --> 00:15:10.291
Something's up.

290
00:15:11.291 --> 00:15:14.000
It says we don't have permission
to work here.

291
00:15:14.083 --> 00:15:15.166
Do we need it?

292
00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:18.291
-Take it all.
-What's happening?

293
00:15:18.375 --> 00:15:20.166
This is my company's property! Help!

294
00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:21.791
Wait! This is mine!

295
00:15:21.875 --> 00:15:22.875
Give it to me!

296
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.041
Teto…

297
00:15:36.875 --> 00:15:40.041
-You should have gotten a permit.
-I didn't know I needed one.

298
00:15:42.916 --> 00:15:46.291
-A shared bathroom.
-This is the best we could get.

299
00:15:47.166 --> 00:15:49.708
Fine. I'm not picky. anyway.

300
00:16:07.583 --> 00:16:11.333
I'm not staying here!
Monique! Igor! Help me! Please!

301
00:16:11.416 --> 00:16:13.666
My heart. I got a shock. I'm going to die.

302
00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:15.416
-Come here.
-I'm gonna die.

303
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.791
I'm about to die. Call Paula.

304
00:16:21.875 --> 00:16:22.833
I'm not well.

305
00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:24.416
I'm not well.

306
00:16:25.541 --> 00:16:27.083
Hello. Teto's cell phone.

307
00:16:28.416 --> 00:16:30.541
Everaldo Coimbra from EverNorte.

308
00:16:30.625 --> 00:16:33.041
Okay. forward the call. He'll answer it.

309
00:16:33.125 --> 00:16:34.291
Take it.

310
00:16:36.333 --> 00:16:39.000
-Hi. Everaldo. what's up?
-What's up. Teto?

311
00:16:39.083 --> 00:16:41.166
I can't talk right now. Too much going on.

312
00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:42.791
I can imagine.

313
00:16:43.291 --> 00:16:46.833
My lawyers talked to the city council.

314
00:16:47.375 --> 00:16:49.916
EverNorte has an exclusivity agreement.

315
00:16:50.916 --> 00:16:52.500
Are you the one who reported us?

316
00:16:53.291 --> 00:16:55.666
We're a small company.
We won't stand in your way.

317
00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:56.958
Let's make a deal.

318
00:16:57.041 --> 00:17:00.166
Boy. I have a deal to propose to you.

319
00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:04.166
If you're interested.
I want to buy Teto Fresco.

320
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:06.041
-What do you mean?
-Buy what?

321
00:17:06.125 --> 00:17:08.208
Let's not talk about this over the phone.

322
00:17:09.166 --> 00:17:14.208
They are honoring me at an event
in Manaus this weekend.

323
00:17:14.291 --> 00:17:17.666
You and Paula are my guests.

324
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:22.583
I want no invitations.
and we have no intention of selling.

325
00:17:23.125 --> 00:17:25.333
Think it through. then call me. okay?

326
00:17:25.875 --> 00:17:27.708
-Selling.
-Selling Teto Fresco?

327
00:17:27.791 --> 00:17:28.791
He wants to fuck us.

328
00:17:28.875 --> 00:17:33.083
Everaldo. from EverNorte.
wants to buy Teto Fresco.

329
00:17:33.166 --> 00:17:37.541
-And you said no without telling us.
-It's an absurd proposal.

330
00:17:37.625 --> 00:17:39.583
We must listen to it.

331
00:17:40.166 --> 00:17:41.708
My God. Paula. I gotta go.

332
00:17:41.791 --> 00:17:43.708
-Teto!
-Come back!

333
00:17:43.791 --> 00:17:46.125
-I can't now. I gotta get ready.
-Okay. fine.

334
00:17:46.208 --> 00:17:49.875
Paula. Jander is saying
we can't wait any longer.

335
00:17:50.625 --> 00:17:53.208
-Okay.
-It's getting late and dark.

336
00:17:53.291 --> 00:17:54.583
-Let's go.
-Shall we?

337
00:17:55.125 --> 00:17:56.000
Let's go.

338
00:18:15.375 --> 00:18:16.208
Hey!

339
00:18:17.291 --> 00:18:18.166
Paula!

340
00:18:21.125 --> 00:18:22.000
Paula.

341
00:18:23.041 --> 00:18:24.125
Teto.

342
00:18:24.208 --> 00:18:26.666
-I can't believe she left.
-I figured.

343
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:31.541
Bringing the company here so quickly.
with no planning. just because of her?

344
00:18:31.625 --> 00:18:34.833
Of course not. I was trying
to save Teto Fresco. and I still am.

345
00:18:34.916 --> 00:18:36.083
Why "save"?

346
00:18:36.583 --> 00:18:39.500
The company isn't very profitable.
but we are not losing money.

347
00:18:40.083 --> 00:18:42.125
It will. though. A lot.

348
00:18:43.916 --> 00:18:46.625
My dad said Trancoso
isn't buying our tomatoes anymore.

349
00:18:46.708 --> 00:18:47.958
What?

350
00:18:48.041 --> 00:18:50.625
-And you hid that from us?
-No. I took action.

351
00:18:50.708 --> 00:18:52.291
We just need a new market.

352
00:18:52.375 --> 00:18:54.750
-Gold jewelry?
-No. pal. Thanks.

353
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:56.500
There's no other way.

354
00:18:56.583 --> 00:18:58.541
Go to his event
and listen to his proposal.

355
00:18:58.625 --> 00:19:01.375
We better sell now
before it's worth nothing.

356
00:19:01.458 --> 00:19:03.375
Guys. you can't pull out now.

357
00:19:04.958 --> 00:19:07.083
I'm not giving up on Teto Fresco or Paula.

358
00:19:07.166 --> 00:19:08.500
-Buddy! Hey!
-What now?

359
00:19:09.041 --> 00:19:10.541
-Do you have rings?
-Yeah.

360
00:19:10.625 --> 00:19:11.666
This one. please.

361
00:19:12.375 --> 00:19:13.208
Thanks.

362
00:19:14.333 --> 00:19:17.041
-What are you doing?
-I'm proposing to Paula now.

363
00:19:17.125 --> 00:19:18.125
-Now?
-Yes.

364
00:19:21.083 --> 00:19:22.500
Are you mad? Come back!

365
00:19:22.583 --> 00:19:24.250
-What about Everaldo?
-Later.

366
00:19:24.791 --> 00:19:25.625
Teto!

367
00:19:38.041 --> 00:19:40.750
Paula!

368
00:19:43.958 --> 00:19:44.916
Are you okay?

369
00:19:46.541 --> 00:19:47.791
-Paula.
-What?

370
00:19:48.291 --> 00:19:49.458
Are you okay?

371
00:19:50.208 --> 00:19:51.541
-Yes.
-Are you sure?

372
00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.916
Paula!

373
00:19:57.666 --> 00:19:59.208
I can't believe this!

374
00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:02.458
Paula!

375
00:20:05.833 --> 00:20:07.208
No!

376
00:20:10.083 --> 00:20:10.916
Damn it!

377
00:20:55.375 --> 00:20:58.666
I just talked to Trancoso.
and it's confirmed. Our contract is over.

378
00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:02.000
Teto brought us here and spent this money
knowing of this bomb.

379
00:21:02.083 --> 00:21:03.750
He's so spoiled! He won't change.

380
00:21:03.833 --> 00:21:06.041
How can he refuse EverNorte's offer?

381
00:21:06.958 --> 00:21:10.541
Did you say. "EverNorte?"
There's something from them here.

382
00:21:11.125 --> 00:21:12.333
Wait.

383
00:21:12.416 --> 00:21:16.166
This is an invitation to Teto and Paula
to an event in Manaus.

384
00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:19.416
Forget it.
Those two are romancing in the forest.

385
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:24.208
If it weren't for my circumference.
and my feet. which are double their size.

386
00:21:24.291 --> 00:21:27.833
I'd be in the forest hunting for him
so that he'd go to this thing.

387
00:21:27.916 --> 00:21:31.708
-Calm down. Don't stress out.
-Just relax.

388
00:21:31.791 --> 00:21:33.041
I have a better idea.

389
00:22:21.916 --> 00:22:24.916
Hi. I'm looking for the doctor
who is working here. Paula.

390
00:22:26.875 --> 00:22:28.083
Yes! Paula!

391
00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:31.625
I don't understand.

392
00:22:31.708 --> 00:22:33.958
Tuyuka. Pawi. stop messing with him.

393
00:22:34.458 --> 00:22:36.041
He had an accident.

394
00:22:36.125 --> 00:22:37.916
You're the golden tomato girl. right?

395
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.500
-My name's Wunin.
-Nice to meet you. Teto.

396
00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:45.916
I'm looking for the doctor
who took care of me. Paula.

397
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.750
-Do you know where she is?
-Paula?

398
00:22:47.833 --> 00:22:49.333
I took care of you.

399
00:22:54.166 --> 00:22:56.291
I thought Dr. Paula had come here.

400
00:22:56.916 --> 00:22:58.166
The Kakydan project.

401
00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:01.000
Some doctors are coming.
but they'll only be here next week.

402
00:23:01.083 --> 00:23:02.250
Only next week?

403
00:23:02.333 --> 00:23:05.041
I've been trying to take care
of our sick people.

404
00:23:05.708 --> 00:23:08.416
Things got worse
because of the problems from outside.

405
00:23:09.208 --> 00:23:11.708
It's so bad that my folks
are working in illegal mining.

406
00:23:11.791 --> 00:23:14.458
That's why you started
that petition. right?

407
00:23:15.333 --> 00:23:17.375
At this pace.
we'll end up being dislodged.

408
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:21.750
Wow. I think… I think I'm not very well.

409
00:23:23.958 --> 00:23:24.916
I know.

410
00:23:26.208 --> 00:23:28.000
It's not just because of the accident.

411
00:23:29.333 --> 00:23:30.625
I'll help you out.

412
00:23:35.125 --> 00:23:36.041
Here we are.

413
00:23:36.125 --> 00:23:38.958
This place is inhabited
by the forest spirits.

414
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:41.291
They can always help.

415
00:23:41.375 --> 00:23:42.541
Forest spirits.

416
00:23:44.875 --> 00:23:46.750
I think I need a painkiller.

417
00:23:49.833 --> 00:23:50.916
Take a sip.

418
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:51.916
What's this?

419
00:23:52.875 --> 00:23:54.750
It's a drink to make us strong.

420
00:23:57.458 --> 00:23:59.375
Just one sip. It's too strong.

421
00:24:00.833 --> 00:24:01.833
You may go.

422
00:24:58.291 --> 00:25:00.458
-What happened?
-How are you?

423
00:25:00.541 --> 00:25:02.541
I saw Paula. What did I see?

424
00:25:03.125 --> 00:25:06.041
When you connect with the forest.
you understand yourself better.

425
00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:10.166
Let's go.

426
00:25:16.375 --> 00:25:20.166
Igor. talk to me.
Call me when you hear this.

427
00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:22.041
I really need to talk to you.

428
00:25:29.958 --> 00:25:31.041
Oh my God.

429
00:25:34.083 --> 00:25:36.708
-Hi.
-Teto Trancoso!

430
00:25:36.791 --> 00:25:39.958
I'm so glad I'll see you
at the Amazonas Theater.

431
00:25:40.916 --> 00:25:43.666
-Me?
-You and Dr. Paula.

432
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:47.541
I've received an email from Teto Fresco
confirming your presence.

433
00:25:48.291 --> 00:25:51.916
and I booked the same hotel
where I'm staying for you two.

434
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.750
We'll be able to negotiate better.

435
00:25:55.833 --> 00:25:56.791
Wunin!

436
00:25:57.375 --> 00:26:00.666
-Sorry to bother you. but I need a boat.
-What about the doctor?

437
00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:03.875
No. I found out there's a pair of traitors
to fish in Manaus.

438
00:26:45.333 --> 00:26:46.541
-Hi! Good afternoon.
-Hi.

439
00:26:46.625 --> 00:26:47.958
Are you on the list?

440
00:26:50.833 --> 00:26:53.458
-Teto Trancoso and Paula Souto.
-Okay.

441
00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:57.166
Teto Trancoso and Paula Souto.
Please. come in.

442
00:26:57.958 --> 00:26:59.875
-Enjoy the event.
-Thank you.

443
00:27:05.833 --> 00:27:08.250
Darling. you can go over there.
behind the theater.

444
00:27:08.333 --> 00:27:10.750
Someone in the kitchen will give you
something to eat.

445
00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:12.458
God bless you. Miss Ounce.

446
00:27:12.541 --> 00:27:15.583
-Hey fella. what's up?
-I don't have any money. man.

447
00:27:15.666 --> 00:27:18.500
Actually. I'll give you some
to work in your place.

448
00:27:18.583 --> 00:27:21.458
Just say how much.
and I'll transfer it to your account.

449
00:27:21.958 --> 00:27:23.166
Are you nuts?

450
00:27:23.958 --> 00:27:25.833
Get out of here.

451
00:27:25.916 --> 00:27:27.250
Come on. man.

452
00:27:31.791 --> 00:27:35.166
Hi there! How's it going?
I'm Teto. Nice to meet you.

453
00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:37.916
-This is not going to end well.
-Igor.

454
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.125
It isn't hard to impersonate Teto.
You've done this before. remember?

455
00:27:41.208 --> 00:27:42.916
Look around.

456
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.125
Pretend you're better than everyone.

457
00:27:46.833 --> 00:27:48.083
I'm Teto.

458
00:27:48.625 --> 00:27:49.458
I'm rich.

459
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:50.875
I'm amazing.

460
00:27:51.791 --> 00:27:55.041
-I'm Teto.
-Of course you're Teto.

461
00:27:55.708 --> 00:27:58.041
You look just like your grandpa!

462
00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:59.625
Everaldo?

463
00:27:59.708 --> 00:28:03.625
This must be the famous Dr. Paula.
from the Kakydan Project.

464
00:28:03.708 --> 00:28:06.208
Yes. that's me. Nice to meet you.

465
00:28:06.291 --> 00:28:09.291
Thank you for the invite
and for your interest in Teto Fresco.

466
00:28:09.375 --> 00:28:12.583
My love. can I steal your boyfriend
for just a minute?

467
00:28:12.666 --> 00:28:14.000
So that we can talk business.

468
00:28:14.083 --> 00:28:16.166
Take this opportunity to have some fun.

469
00:28:21.125 --> 00:28:23.083
Teto. I can't believe this.

470
00:28:23.166 --> 00:28:24.500
Teto. come back here!

471
00:28:24.583 --> 00:28:26.458
Teto. I know it's you!

472
00:28:27.541 --> 00:28:29.791
-Teto! What is this?
-What. Monique?

473
00:28:29.875 --> 00:28:32.583
You're selling the company behind my back.

474
00:28:32.666 --> 00:28:35.166
You ran away.
and we couldn't miss this chance.

475
00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:37.666
I'll tell Dr. Everaldo
you're lying to him.

476
00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:40.000
He won't buy tomatoes from you.
I wanna see that.

477
00:28:40.083 --> 00:28:42.750
Hold up! Is there something going on?

478
00:28:43.333 --> 00:28:44.666
Is he bothering you?

479
00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:48.666
No. he's just explaining
what's in Blood Mary.

480
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:49.708
Tomato.

481
00:28:49.791 --> 00:28:51.916
Thank you. I'm done with tomatoes.

482
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.208
Excuse me.

483
00:28:56.166 --> 00:28:58.083
I'm sorry.
I thought it was something else.

484
00:28:59.208 --> 00:29:00.375
Don't worry.

485
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.583
There are lots of crazy guys out there.

486
00:29:04.208 --> 00:29:05.083
Yep.

487
00:29:05.166 --> 00:29:08.875
What I did for Trancoso
made your grandfather trust me.

488
00:29:10.166 --> 00:29:13.125
I was just a kid
without a penny to my name.

489
00:29:13.208 --> 00:29:16.125
but your grandfather said I was family.

490
00:29:16.208 --> 00:29:19.291
-I can imagine.
-He planned things. and I executed them.

491
00:29:20.041 --> 00:29:23.333
When he wanted to jump an enemy. you know?

492
00:29:23.416 --> 00:29:26.875
Forge some documents. change some fences.

493
00:29:26.958 --> 00:29:30.708
basic stuff that everybody does.
I'd do it.

494
00:29:31.416 --> 00:29:33.458
We had a deal.

495
00:29:33.541 --> 00:29:36.375
This would be my area.

496
00:29:36.458 --> 00:29:41.083
I wasn't meant to have competitors.
much less from a Trancoso.

497
00:29:41.166 --> 00:29:44.750
-Sorry. I didn't know about that.
-Of course you didn't.

498
00:29:44.833 --> 00:29:47.500
He wasn't going to tell
neither you nor your father.

499
00:29:47.583 --> 00:29:50.041
In fact. when he sent me out here.

500
00:29:50.125 --> 00:29:52.583
it was his way of hiding me.

501
00:29:52.666 --> 00:29:54.708
But I don't work for Trancoso.

502
00:29:54.791 --> 00:29:57.625
My partners and I started
our own company. Teto Fresco.

503
00:29:57.708 --> 00:29:59.166
a co-op. totally different.

504
00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:02.375
It's okay. Let's talk about Teto Fresco.

505
00:30:05.333 --> 00:30:06.333
Hi. there.

506
00:30:06.416 --> 00:30:08.791
Fella. your service is really bad.

507
00:30:08.875 --> 00:30:11.333
The party organizer wanted to save money.
Talk to him.

508
00:30:11.416 --> 00:30:12.250
Go!

509
00:30:14.791 --> 00:30:15.958
-That's why.
-Probably.

510
00:30:16.041 --> 00:30:18.500
-Have you been to this theater before?
-No. never.

511
00:30:18.583 --> 00:30:19.416
-Never?

512
00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:20.833
-It's beautiful.
-Yeah.

513
00:30:20.916 --> 00:30:22.125
-That way?
-This way.

514
00:30:23.166 --> 00:30:24.000
Paula?

515
00:30:27.166 --> 00:30:29.958
He didn't want to let her in.
He said she was already here.

516
00:30:30.541 --> 00:30:31.375
We did it.

517
00:30:31.458 --> 00:30:33.166
I wouldn't have that issue. right?

518
00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:34.375
Come here.

519
00:30:34.458 --> 00:30:36.541
-I don't know many Tawans. Do you?
-Come.

520
00:30:36.625 --> 00:30:38.791
-Tawan? It's different.
-I'll be right back.

521
00:30:39.291 --> 00:30:43.125
-Teto! What's going on?
-Aren't you supposed to be in the forest?

522
00:30:43.208 --> 00:30:44.458
What are you wearing?

523
00:30:46.666 --> 00:30:47.541
Come with me.

524
00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:54.833
-Come.
-What are you doing here?

525
00:30:54.916 --> 00:30:57.666
I thought you were working.
and you're here with Dr. Tawan.

526
00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:00.375
I'm here for work.
It's my sponsor's event.

527
00:31:00.458 --> 00:31:01.375
What about you?

528
00:31:04.166 --> 00:31:05.333
-For her. please.
-Of course.

529
00:31:05.416 --> 00:31:06.333
Thanks.

530
00:31:06.416 --> 00:31:07.958
How do you like the party?

531
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:11.750
I just don't understand one thing.

532
00:31:12.666 --> 00:31:15.458
Is this party sponsored
by EverNorte Tomatoes

533
00:31:15.541 --> 00:31:17.916
and the award receiver
is the company owner?

534
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.958
-I don't know what to say.
-Did he get rich and lose his mind?

535
00:31:21.916 --> 00:31:23.250
-Well. actually…
-My daughter!

536
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:25.125
-Dad.
-Dr. Paula.

537
00:31:25.708 --> 00:31:27.750
I can see you've met Solange.

538
00:31:28.958 --> 00:31:31.916
-Daughter?
-Dr. Paula from the Kakydan project.

539
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.541
This is Teodoro Trancoso Neto. Teto.

540
00:31:35.625 --> 00:31:37.083
-The co-op guy.
-Exactly.

541
00:31:37.166 --> 00:31:39.791
Together with his partners.
Igor and Monique.

542
00:31:39.875 --> 00:31:40.958
-who didn't come.
-Yes.

543
00:31:41.041 --> 00:31:42.416
Nice to meet you. Solange.

544
00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:43.333
Nice to meet you.

545
00:31:43.416 --> 00:31:45.708
She works with me at EverNorte.

546
00:31:45.791 --> 00:31:50.541
My idea is that she'll take over
Teto Fresco in Rio de Janeiro.

547
00:31:50.625 --> 00:31:52.875
We still need to discuss that. Dad.

548
00:31:52.958 --> 00:31:55.750
We'll have a lot of time to talk.
right. Teto?

549
00:31:55.833 --> 00:31:58.250
-We're staying at the same hotel.
-We are?

550
00:31:58.958 --> 00:32:02.416
Didn't he tell you?
We discussed it over the phone.

551
00:32:03.166 --> 00:32:04.875
-Oh. right!
-Of course I told her.

552
00:32:04.958 --> 00:32:06.500
I mentioned the bedroom.

553
00:32:06.583 --> 00:32:07.416
-Yeah!
-Sorry.

554
00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:10.708
Well. I've got to go.
It's time for my speech.

555
00:32:10.791 --> 00:32:12.208
I'm on my way. sweetie.

556
00:32:12.791 --> 00:32:16.041
If you'll excuse me.
I have some things to take care of.

557
00:32:19.875 --> 00:32:22.875
That's all I need.
Another tomato princess.

558
00:32:22.958 --> 00:32:25.458
-What's going on?
-I think I said too much.

559
00:32:25.541 --> 00:32:27.416
She might ruin everything.

560
00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.333
-Either her or Teto.
-Teto?

561
00:32:29.416 --> 00:32:31.750
I can't believe you came here
to spy on me.

562
00:32:31.833 --> 00:32:33.750
I'm here to spy on my partners

563
00:32:33.833 --> 00:32:35.875
and stop your sponsor
from buying Teto Fresco.

564
00:32:35.958 --> 00:32:38.083
-which is the best thing I've done.
-Stop it.

565
00:32:38.166 --> 00:32:41.916
Can't you see how absurd it is for you
to show up here in a costume at my job?

566
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.541
I didn't know you'd be here.

567
00:32:43.625 --> 00:32:46.166
I went after you on a boat.
in the community.

568
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:48.458
-I waited for you. but you never came.
-Look.

569
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:53.166
I don't know if it was fate
or if the forest spirits brought you back.

570
00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:55.750
-What?
-What matters is you're here with me now.

571
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.041
What is this. Teto?

572
00:33:00.125 --> 00:33:02.041
Are you drunk? Did you hit your head?

573
00:33:02.125 --> 00:33:04.375
I did. and I drank something.
but I'm not crazy.

574
00:33:05.166 --> 00:33:08.250
I know exactly what I want.
which is to be with you forever.

575
00:33:08.333 --> 00:33:10.750
-I risked everything for you.
-Stop. Get up.

576
00:33:10.833 --> 00:33:14.916
Stop saying that you risked or sacrificed
something for me.

577
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000
You did it for yourself.
You do things for yourself.

578
00:33:19.708 --> 00:33:24.541
Damn. You're so spoiled and selfish.
Can't you see I have my own life. too?

579
00:33:27.083 --> 00:33:29.000
Did you think I'd want to get married now?

580
00:33:30.791 --> 00:33:31.875
I can't. Teto.

581
00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:36.208
I can't be with someone
who won't respect my priorities.

582
00:33:36.291 --> 00:33:38.333
I thought I was important to you. too.

583
00:33:39.875 --> 00:33:40.833
You see?

584
00:33:42.166 --> 00:33:43.000
I can't.

585
00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:44.708
I'm done. It's over.

586
00:33:50.375 --> 00:33:51.250
Paula!

587
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.291
-Paula!
-It's time!

588
00:33:56.291 --> 00:33:57.958
-Time for what?
-It's time. Let's go!

589
00:33:58.041 --> 00:33:59.333
The sun in motion.

590
00:33:59.416 --> 00:34:00.291
Applause.

591
00:34:01.791 --> 00:34:02.625
Bravo!

592
00:34:23.333 --> 00:34:26.166
That blue macaw doesn't know
what he's doing there.

593
00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:28.416
Definitely not. That's Teto.

594
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:46.083
-I better go. or he'll ruin everything.
-Everaldo!

595
00:34:48.333 --> 00:34:51.750
Awesome. my people.
I love this place so much.

596
00:34:51.833 --> 00:34:55.666
Hey. Come over here. We need to talk.

597
00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:57.291
Solange?

598
00:34:58.541 --> 00:34:59.666
Keep this a secret!

599
00:35:03.958 --> 00:35:06.583
I'll have one of these
because I really need it.

600
00:35:10.333 --> 00:35:11.500
Paula. where are you?

601
00:35:11.583 --> 00:35:14.333
When you hear this message. call me back.

602
00:35:14.416 --> 00:35:16.875
What's going on. Teto?
Do you want to blow it?

603
00:35:16.958 --> 00:35:19.583
You want to ruin what we built.
and I'm the one who's blowing it up?

604
00:35:19.666 --> 00:35:20.666
It's over. Teto.

605
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:24.500
You want us to throw away the one chance
to get something in return for our effort?

606
00:35:24.583 --> 00:35:26.375
That's the point. There's another way.

607
00:35:26.458 --> 00:35:28.500
I can save Teto Fresco.
I have a great idea.

608
00:35:28.583 --> 00:35:31.708
I don't care.
I can't play games with my life anymore.

609
00:35:31.791 --> 00:35:33.000
I'm about to be a father.

610
00:35:33.083 --> 00:35:35.500
-I gotta think of my child.
-Look at you!

611
00:35:35.583 --> 00:35:37.583
A little Trancoso is coming up.

612
00:35:37.666 --> 00:35:40.208
You're pregnant. Paula? Congratulations.

613
00:35:41.166 --> 00:35:42.000
Yeah.

614
00:35:42.083 --> 00:35:46.625
-Sorry. but drinking that is not okay.
-Come on. Dad. She's a doctor.

615
00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:48.208
No. he's right.

616
00:35:48.291 --> 00:35:50.125
I was confused. I got this for Teto.

617
00:35:50.208 --> 00:35:51.125
Thanks.

618
00:35:51.666 --> 00:35:53.833
-Hey!
-Who are you. young man?

619
00:35:54.333 --> 00:35:55.166
-Me?
-That's Igor.

620
00:35:55.916 --> 00:35:58.125
This is Igor. the other business partner.

621
00:35:58.208 --> 00:35:59.833
Did you come to dance?

622
00:35:59.916 --> 00:36:03.166
No. I'm here because I heard
they're negotiating Teto Fresco's sale.

623
00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:04.750
-Is that right?
-Wait a minute.

624
00:36:05.583 --> 00:36:06.791
I know who you are.

625
00:36:06.875 --> 00:36:09.208
I can't believe it!

626
00:36:09.291 --> 00:36:12.708
You're the son of Antônio and…
What's her name?

627
00:36:12.791 --> 00:36:14.250
-Rose.
-Rose!

628
00:36:14.333 --> 00:36:16.750
-The housekeepers on the Trancoso farm.
-Right.

629
00:36:16.833 --> 00:36:19.000
-And now you're business partners.
-Yes.

630
00:36:19.083 --> 00:36:21.625
I've always been treated as a brother.

631
00:36:21.708 --> 00:36:24.041
We built this company together.
and I can't believe

632
00:36:24.125 --> 00:36:26.250
you're giving it up like this.

633
00:36:26.333 --> 00:36:28.958
Igor. you gotta think
about yourself a little

634
00:36:29.041 --> 00:36:32.583
because I'll always have my father
to help me while you…

635
00:36:32.666 --> 00:36:35.083
Don't worry.
I know how to save Teto Fresco.

636
00:36:35.166 --> 00:36:36.250
-Oh God.
-I mean it.

637
00:36:36.333 --> 00:36:38.541
I want to make a Teto Fresco co-op

638
00:36:38.625 --> 00:36:40.791
in a partnership
with the Hipanaa Indigenous community.

639
00:36:40.875 --> 00:36:42.791
a sustainable agroforestry.

640
00:36:42.875 --> 00:36:46.000
They'll have the autonomy
to grow whatever they want on their land.

641
00:36:47.125 --> 00:36:48.958
-That's not a bad idea.
-Hey. young man.

642
00:36:49.041 --> 00:36:51.083
Do you have their authorization?

643
00:36:51.166 --> 00:36:54.500
-Not yet.
-I don't want to discourage you.

644
00:36:54.583 --> 00:36:56.583
but I doubt you'll get it.

645
00:36:57.166 --> 00:36:59.958
This is our chance to keep Teto Fresco.

646
00:37:00.041 --> 00:37:02.541
No other offer he makes
will be as good as this.

647
00:37:02.625 --> 00:37:04.291
My offer is nine million.

648
00:37:05.916 --> 00:37:07.416
Three million for each partner.

649
00:37:08.208 --> 00:37:09.166
Are you okay?

650
00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:11.416
-He's choking.
-He choked on the tomato.

651
00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:12.833
Look at his face!

652
00:37:12.916 --> 00:37:14.583
He's purple! Is there a doctor here?

653
00:37:14.666 --> 00:37:17.166
There's you. right. doctor?
To perforate his throat.

654
00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:19.291
Take the knife to stick into his throat.

655
00:37:19.375 --> 00:37:20.583
-Here.
-Knife?

656
00:37:20.666 --> 00:37:23.625
To perforate the trachea
and breathe through the pen tube.

657
00:37:23.708 --> 00:37:25.208
-Yes. that's it.
-Right?

658
00:37:25.291 --> 00:37:27.916
-You want me to do it?
-It's either that or he'll die.

659
00:37:28.791 --> 00:37:30.541
-A knife?
-One. two…

660
00:37:30.625 --> 00:37:32.000
Excuse me.

661
00:37:32.083 --> 00:37:33.166
There's Dr. Tawan.

662
00:37:36.416 --> 00:37:38.583
You gotta puncture him.
He's not breathing.

663
00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:40.583
That's not gonna work.

664
00:37:42.833 --> 00:37:44.916
-Oh my God!
-Are you okay?

665
00:37:45.416 --> 00:37:47.875
-You okay?
-No need for that. Thanks.

666
00:37:47.958 --> 00:37:48.875
You're welcome.

667
00:37:51.041 --> 00:37:52.000
Tawan.

668
00:37:52.083 --> 00:37:53.083
What about Paula?

669
00:37:53.791 --> 00:37:56.458
-Do you know where she is?
-She left.

670
00:37:57.291 --> 00:37:58.875
She wasn't feeling well.

671
00:37:58.958 --> 00:38:01.666
I don't want to interfere.
but leave her alone.

672
00:38:02.416 --> 00:38:03.708
Leave her on her own.

673
00:38:04.208 --> 00:38:05.708
Well. I've got to go.

674
00:38:13.625 --> 00:38:14.458
There he is.

675
00:38:17.791 --> 00:38:18.958
Teto.

676
00:38:19.041 --> 00:38:19.916
Hey.

677
00:38:22.625 --> 00:38:25.041
-Are you okay?
-Who cares if I'm okay?

678
00:38:26.041 --> 00:38:28.875
-I'm spoiled and selfish. right?
-Do you want me to tell you?

679
00:38:28.958 --> 00:38:30.458
You don't need to.

680
00:38:30.541 --> 00:38:33.208
The only thing I want
is an agreement. a deal.

681
00:38:33.291 --> 00:38:36.541
-We can't take chances like kids anymore.
-Calm down!

682
00:38:37.666 --> 00:38:40.208
Let me make a partnership
with the Hipanaa community.

683
00:38:40.291 --> 00:38:41.541
I just need a week.

684
00:38:41.625 --> 00:38:44.125
This company is worth much more
than what he's offering.

685
00:38:45.458 --> 00:38:48.875
I know I have a thousand flaws.
I know you have a million reasons

686
00:38:48.958 --> 00:38:52.500
to be suspicious of me.
but all I need is a week. That's all.

687
00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:56.291
If you want to sell the company.
we'll sell it.

688
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.791
-I'm not so sure.
-Please. Just one week.

689
00:38:59.875 --> 00:39:02.750
I just need one week. Please.

690
00:39:05.833 --> 00:39:08.166
-That's enough to draw up the contracts.
-Yes!

691
00:39:10.041 --> 00:39:11.791
-One week.
-One week.

692
00:39:11.875 --> 00:39:13.958
Trust me. It'll work out.

693
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:32.791
I think it's over there.

694
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:39.833
Thank you.

695
00:39:48.791 --> 00:39:49.750
Wunin?

696
00:39:50.333 --> 00:39:52.875
I need to talk to you. I need your help.

697
00:39:55.208 --> 00:39:57.416
-Good morning.
-Solange!

698
00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:00.083
-I've brought some swimsuits for you.
-Thanks!

699
00:40:00.166 --> 00:40:01.083
Thank you.

700
00:40:01.583 --> 00:40:02.583
One more thing!

701
00:40:02.666 --> 00:40:05.750
My dad asked if I could go to Rio with you
and see Teto Fresco.

702
00:40:06.583 --> 00:40:09.291
Of course.
Please come. It'll be our pleasure.

703
00:40:09.375 --> 00:40:11.458
-Okay then. See you later.
-See you.

704
00:40:14.583 --> 00:40:16.958
I'm sorry. but I can't help you.
I told you.

705
00:40:17.458 --> 00:40:19.375
I've got so much to deal with here.

706
00:40:19.458 --> 00:40:21.541
I know but just think about it.

707
00:40:21.625 --> 00:40:24.541
If this works out.
no one will need to work in the mines.

708
00:40:24.625 --> 00:40:26.375
-What do you mean?
-I mean the money

709
00:40:26.458 --> 00:40:28.333
that you'll make from growing tomatoes.

710
00:40:28.416 --> 00:40:32.458
With the tomato money. people won't need
to risk themselves in illegal mining.

711
00:40:33.625 --> 00:40:36.375
That would be a great way
to make the community stronger.

712
00:40:36.458 --> 00:40:38.791
-Yes.
-Then we could stay here.

713
00:40:38.875 --> 00:40:40.083
Deal?

714
00:40:40.166 --> 00:40:43.083
Hold up. young man.
Do you think it's that simple?

715
00:40:44.208 --> 00:40:47.875
Although I want to help you.
we have several leaders.

716
00:40:47.958 --> 00:40:49.875
Everything here is decided collectively.

717
00:40:49.958 --> 00:40:52.833
It won't be easy for people to trust you
because of you're--

718
00:40:52.916 --> 00:40:54.291
Spoiled and selfish? I know.

719
00:40:54.375 --> 00:40:56.583
I was going to say "white".
but that works too.

720
00:40:58.166 --> 00:41:00.500
That doctor you were looking for.

721
00:41:00.583 --> 00:41:02.916
I've heard that
she's in a neighbor community.

722
00:41:04.083 --> 00:41:07.583
Thanks. but I'm focused on my work now.

723
00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:16.916
I'll be right back. okay?

724
00:41:19.208 --> 00:41:23.458
Did you notice that their symptoms
are the same as in Porto Remanso?

725
00:41:30.958 --> 00:41:31.916
Come here!

726
00:41:44.375 --> 00:41:45.458
Paula.

727
00:41:49.625 --> 00:41:51.708
Tapuya's mother gave me this fish.

728
00:41:51.791 --> 00:41:56.625
-It was the last thing the girl ate.
-Only moms would think of that.

729
00:41:56.708 --> 00:41:59.708
We could take them to examine
along with the girl in Porto Remanso.

730
00:41:59.791 --> 00:42:02.041
We could take blood samples. but…

731
00:42:02.125 --> 00:42:05.125
-her mother doesn't want us to bring her.
-So we leave her here?

732
00:42:05.208 --> 00:42:07.333
-No way!
-Pajé Mandu will take care of her.

733
00:42:07.416 --> 00:42:10.166
Tawan. she's not okay.
She needs a hospital.

734
00:42:10.791 --> 00:42:11.625
Come here.

735
00:42:14.541 --> 00:42:16.416
-Do you know what this is?
-No.

736
00:42:17.708 --> 00:42:19.083
It's a chinchona peel.

737
00:42:19.166 --> 00:42:20.791
It's used to treat malaria.

738
00:42:20.875 --> 00:42:23.541
It was the Native people
who discovered it.

739
00:42:23.625 --> 00:42:26.041
This is a willow peel. which is aspirin.

740
00:42:26.125 --> 00:42:27.708
Jaborandi is an eye drop.

741
00:42:27.791 --> 00:42:30.166
Breu Branco is an anti-inflammatory. so…

742
00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:32.500
Trust the medicine of the forest.

743
00:42:32.583 --> 00:42:35.250
There are people looking
for a cure for cancer here.

744
00:42:35.333 --> 00:42:36.875
But I'm worried about Tapuya.

745
00:42:36.958 --> 00:42:40.000
Pajé Mandu has been taking care of them
since before we were born.

746
00:42:48.291 --> 00:42:49.541
I'll help in any way I can.

747
00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:52.791
Everything will be okay.

748
00:43:03.333 --> 00:43:04.333
You know what. Teto?

749
00:43:04.416 --> 00:43:07.458
I'm glad Solange's going
to Rio de Janeiro with you.

750
00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:12.333
One of the reasons I want her
to take over Teto Fresco

751
00:43:12.416 --> 00:43:15.958
is to bring our families close once again.

752
00:43:16.041 --> 00:43:19.666
That will also do good for her.
so she makes new friends.

753
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:22.125
-Right. sweetheart?
-What's wrong with my friends?

754
00:43:22.208 --> 00:43:23.625
I have nothing against them.

755
00:43:23.708 --> 00:43:28.083
But you can't compare them
to affluent people like Teto and Paula.

756
00:43:28.166 --> 00:43:30.250
What's this affluent talk all about. Dad?

757
00:43:30.333 --> 00:43:34.166
-Look who's talking.
-I always aim high.

758
00:43:35.791 --> 00:43:37.291
That's why we're here.

759
00:43:39.833 --> 00:43:42.083
Teto. if you would follow me.

760
00:43:42.166 --> 00:43:44.333
We need to have a serious chat.

761
00:43:46.583 --> 00:43:47.416
Sure.

762
00:43:58.416 --> 00:43:59.750
My dad hates my friends.

763
00:44:00.333 --> 00:44:04.291
Imagine if he knew
I'm in a popular dance group.

764
00:44:05.375 --> 00:44:06.375
I see it coming.

765
00:44:07.375 --> 00:44:09.916
Thank you for not saying anything.

766
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.541
Don't sweat it.

767
00:44:12.041 --> 00:44:15.250
I think it's a shame
you hide something so beautiful.

768
00:44:15.333 --> 00:44:17.000
You should be proud of that.

769
00:44:17.083 --> 00:44:20.041
-We both have our secrets.
-What secrets?

770
00:44:20.125 --> 00:44:22.416
I just want you to know you can trust me.

771
00:44:25.416 --> 00:44:27.208
What if I tell you I'm not Dr. Paula?

772
00:44:29.166 --> 00:44:30.416
I know. You're Monique.

773
00:44:31.458 --> 00:44:35.791
I looked you up last night.
You're one of the Teto Fresco founders.

774
00:44:35.875 --> 00:44:39.875
I'm just sorry that you're hiding
something that makes you so proud.

775
00:44:40.541 --> 00:44:42.708
I think I'll come clean with him.

776
00:44:42.791 --> 00:44:44.458
No! Are you crazy?

777
00:44:44.541 --> 00:44:46.333
You don't know my dad.

778
00:44:47.208 --> 00:44:51.208
If you really want to close the deal.
you'd better go all the way.

779
00:44:51.291 --> 00:44:56.708
I'll tell you something
you need to know about your partner.

780
00:44:56.791 --> 00:44:58.750
He's not who you think he is.

781
00:44:59.541 --> 00:45:01.625
Me? Who?

782
00:45:01.708 --> 00:45:04.833
I'm telling you a secret
from your grandfather.

783
00:45:04.916 --> 00:45:06.375
Your dad's dad.

784
00:45:07.958 --> 00:45:10.416
He had a son out of wedlock.

785
00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:13.250
I don't know how no one suspected it.

786
00:45:13.958 --> 00:45:16.375
Of course that kid is a Trancoso.

787
00:45:17.666 --> 00:45:18.791
I don't understand.

788
00:45:18.875 --> 00:45:22.666
This guy. Igor. who you keep saying
is your partner.

789
00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:24.250
He's your grandfather's son.

790
00:45:24.833 --> 00:45:27.291
I handed him to the farm housekeepers
to raise him.

791
00:45:27.375 --> 00:45:30.041
-But…
-You'd better watch out. Teto.

792
00:45:30.125 --> 00:45:32.125
I know these people.

793
00:45:32.208 --> 00:45:36.375
He will want
at least half the Trancoso fortune.

794
00:45:40.375 --> 00:45:41.541
I don't know what to say.

795
00:45:41.625 --> 00:45:43.541
Just thank me.

796
00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:51.333
To deserve our folks' trust.
you must contribute like everybody else.

797
00:45:51.416 --> 00:45:52.250
-Got it?
-Got it.

798
00:45:52.333 --> 00:45:54.458
Maria da Terra is one of the leaders

799
00:45:54.541 --> 00:45:58.000
who decides who can or cannot
be accepted in the community.

800
00:45:58.083 --> 00:46:00.541
She's the one who teaches us
the basic tasks here.

801
00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:04.666
-Farming. fishing. handcrafting.
-I was born and raised on a farm.

802
00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:05.750
I'll kill it.

803
00:46:08.083 --> 00:46:09.083
I'll nail it.

804
00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:11.583
Go ahead.

805
00:47:11.458 --> 00:47:12.500
Wow.

806
00:47:12.583 --> 00:47:16.750
You'd better go to sleep
because we'll be up at 4 a.m. tomorrow.

807
00:47:16.833 --> 00:47:17.875
Why 4 a.m.?

808
00:47:18.625 --> 00:47:21.250
We stop working at 10 a.m.
because it gets too hot.

809
00:47:21.333 --> 00:47:23.583
Four a.m.? No way.

810
00:47:24.208 --> 00:47:26.375
I'd rather sleep some more.

811
00:47:26.458 --> 00:47:29.333
I have no problem with the sun.
I actually like it. Okay?

812
00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.125
I can't believe this.

813
00:48:00.208 --> 00:48:03.000
Teto Fresco started with you
selling a car.

814
00:48:03.083 --> 00:48:05.625
and now it is worth nine million.

815
00:48:05.708 --> 00:48:08.041
Of course they could've rounded it up.

816
00:48:12.083 --> 00:48:12.916
Hey.

817
00:48:13.625 --> 00:48:16.166
-Are you okay?
-Headache.

818
00:48:16.666 --> 00:48:19.083
You can't fool me. Spill it.

819
00:48:19.166 --> 00:48:22.375
-I don't want to stress you out.
-But you did! Okay?

820
00:48:22.458 --> 00:48:24.333
Do you want me to go into labor?

821
00:48:24.916 --> 00:48:26.416
-Say it.
-Calm down.

822
00:48:27.083 --> 00:48:29.458
I was raised in a community like this.

823
00:48:29.541 --> 00:48:33.125
and I'm so proud
of having changed their reality.

824
00:48:33.208 --> 00:48:34.541
At least a little bit.

825
00:48:36.958 --> 00:48:41.375
This is amazing. I wish I knew
what your achievement feels like.

826
00:48:44.541 --> 00:48:47.750
I didn't want to quit Manaus
or my dance group.

827
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000
But now I can visualize
something great about coming to Rio.

828
00:48:56.291 --> 00:48:58.083
Are you excited about the project?

829
00:48:59.916 --> 00:49:01.791
I'm not just talking about the project.

830
00:49:12.291 --> 00:49:13.250
It slipped.

831
00:49:14.375 --> 00:49:15.708
It slipped. right?

832
00:49:19.958 --> 00:49:22.000
Igor. this is really serious.

833
00:49:22.083 --> 00:49:23.791
How can we find out if this is true?

834
00:49:23.875 --> 00:49:26.833
The story was always that I was left
at the Trancoso farm gate.

835
00:49:26.916 --> 00:49:28.916
That's what Everaldo told my parents.

836
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.375
Now we're really going to need
the Teto Fresco money

837
00:49:31.458 --> 00:49:33.458
because that'll be one hell of a fight.

838
00:49:33.958 --> 00:49:35.583
Fight? What do you mean?

839
00:49:35.666 --> 00:49:39.625
To prove you're the heir.
We'll have to hire a good lawyer.

840
00:49:39.708 --> 00:49:42.708
There will be no fight.
I want no money. I'm not like that.

841
00:49:42.791 --> 00:49:46.250
Have you lost your mind? Like that how?

842
00:49:46.333 --> 00:49:50.250
The kind who gives up their own rights?
Your son's rights?

843
00:49:50.333 --> 00:49:53.875
Listen. Igor. I accepted loving you
and respecting you in poverty.

844
00:49:53.958 --> 00:49:54.958
Not in stupidity.

845
00:49:56.708 --> 00:49:57.875
Good evening.

846
00:49:58.791 --> 00:49:59.833
Good evening.

847
00:50:07.958 --> 00:50:10.916
It's working. So much charisma here.

848
00:50:11.791 --> 00:50:15.166
The harvest you didn't reap today
would be the folks' meal tomorrow.

849
00:50:20.625 --> 00:50:22.458
Can I make it up with tomatoes?

850
00:50:25.250 --> 00:50:27.541
I'm serious. You haven't tried it yet.

851
00:50:28.291 --> 00:50:29.125
Try it.

852
00:50:31.916 --> 00:50:32.916
So?

853
00:50:35.208 --> 00:50:37.000
It's good. Very good.

854
00:50:37.083 --> 00:50:39.541
-Better than Macunaíma's?
-Macunaima.

855
00:50:39.625 --> 00:50:41.416
Yours is not even close.

856
00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:44.500
-I'd love to try this golden tomato. too.
-You missed the chance.

857
00:50:45.875 --> 00:50:48.208
I ate golden tomatoes when I was young.

858
00:50:48.291 --> 00:50:50.666
when we lived at the country's border.

859
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:52.458
I thought you were from here.

860
00:50:54.666 --> 00:50:56.250
It was nice where we used to live.

861
00:50:56.833 --> 00:50:59.791
But they took away our land.
and they want to do the same here.

862
00:50:59.875 --> 00:51:02.625
See?
That's why we need to help each other.

863
00:51:02.708 --> 00:51:05.500
You won't be able to help anyone
until you know…

864
00:51:07.166 --> 00:51:09.500
-What does that mean?
-To live collectively.

865
00:51:09.583 --> 00:51:10.750
I'm trying.

866
00:51:10.833 --> 00:51:13.375
I only see you trying
to do things your way.

867
00:51:14.458 --> 00:51:17.083
You need to learn to see
and listen to others

868
00:51:17.166 --> 00:51:19.875
in the same way you want others
to see and listen to you.

869
00:51:38.666 --> 00:51:40.875
Come on. Teto. It's four a.m.

870
00:51:57.416 --> 00:51:58.291
Here.

871
00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:04.333
Hey.

872
00:52:04.875 --> 00:52:06.916
Excuse me. Tuyuka. isn't it?

873
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.833
No. I'm Pawi. He's Tuyuka.

874
00:52:08.916 --> 00:52:10.000
-Hi.
-Hi.

875
00:52:10.083 --> 00:52:12.291
You saved my life. and I didn't thank you.

876
00:52:12.375 --> 00:52:13.750
-Don't mention it.
-Thanks.

877
00:52:26.041 --> 00:52:27.041
Yay!

878
00:52:39.375 --> 00:52:40.375
Did you see that?

879
00:52:43.541 --> 00:52:46.166
Cacuri is a type of trap. Check it out.

880
00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:49.791
The fish will smell the cassava peel.
enter this hole.

881
00:52:50.291 --> 00:52:52.375
and then it can't leave the cacuri.

882
00:52:52.958 --> 00:52:55.500
Cacuri. isn't it? Cool.

883
00:52:55.583 --> 00:52:58.291
We'll place cacuris from here to Aanu.

884
00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:00.375
Wow.

885
00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:02.458
Let's go.

886
00:53:23.541 --> 00:53:24.666
Her temperature dropped.

887
00:53:25.333 --> 00:53:26.166
Yes. it has.

888
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:27.583
Congratulations. little girl.

889
00:53:27.666 --> 00:53:29.666
-Hi.
-I'm glad you came.

890
00:53:31.291 --> 00:53:33.208
I must apologize to you. Tawan.

891
00:53:33.291 --> 00:53:34.583
-No. you don't.
-Yes. I do.

892
00:53:34.666 --> 00:53:37.041
I was stubborn.
If we'd taken this girl away.

893
00:53:37.125 --> 00:53:40.208
and something had happened to her.
I wouldn't forgive myself.

894
00:53:40.291 --> 00:53:41.833
-Come on. Paula.
-Seriously.

895
00:53:41.916 --> 00:53:45.416
Sometimes I act as if I own the truth.

896
00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:47.833
I don't want to be a spoiled.
selfish person.

897
00:53:47.916 --> 00:53:50.291
-What? What do you mean?
-I really don't.

898
00:53:50.375 --> 00:53:51.958
Look at what you're doing.

899
00:53:52.041 --> 00:53:54.583
You're allowing yourself
to question your beliefs.

900
00:53:54.666 --> 00:53:56.500
That takes courage. doesn't it?

901
00:53:57.208 --> 00:53:59.166
You're saying that so I won't feel bad.

902
00:54:00.291 --> 00:54:02.208
Sorry. I shouldn't have said anything.

903
00:54:02.291 --> 00:54:03.583
I can't believe this.

904
00:54:03.666 --> 00:54:06.666
Is Dr. Paula apologizing
because she apologized?

905
00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:09.458
-Is that right?
-I'm just so bad.

906
00:54:09.541 --> 00:54:10.958
Seriously. dude.

907
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:14.958
You know what?
What's wrong with being a little stubborn?

908
00:54:15.041 --> 00:54:19.000
I call that willpower. determination.

909
00:54:19.083 --> 00:54:20.833
That's not a bad thing.

910
00:54:21.833 --> 00:54:24.250
I think that's beautiful. Strong.

911
00:54:25.166 --> 00:54:26.541
Fascinating.

912
00:54:37.166 --> 00:54:38.000
Come on. Teto.

913
00:54:40.541 --> 00:54:41.375
Let's go.

914
00:54:50.291 --> 00:54:52.083
What about the tests you took?

915
00:54:53.541 --> 00:54:56.666
It seems it's an intoxication
caused by mercury.

916
00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:59.000
-High doses.
-You know what this means.

917
00:54:59.083 --> 00:55:01.458
-Mercury? Illegal mining.
-Mining.

918
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.750
That's why people won't say a word.

919
00:55:03.833 --> 00:55:06.041
We must do something about it.

920
00:55:06.125 --> 00:55:09.291
Take the tests to the health department.
File a complaint.

921
00:55:09.375 --> 00:55:13.208
That's it.
I don't know if that will help. though.

922
00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:16.458
These complaints mean nothing around here.

923
00:55:33.541 --> 00:55:36.125
We ran these tests at the Aanu community.

924
00:55:36.208 --> 00:55:40.500
We thought it'd be important
to run these tests here at Hipanaa. too.

925
00:55:40.583 --> 00:55:43.583
Okay. There'll be a party.
and you're invited.

926
00:55:43.666 --> 00:55:46.166
Today? We got here at the right time.

927
00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:47.083
Yes.

928
00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:50.375
What's up. Teto?

929
00:55:51.791 --> 00:55:53.083
I'll be right there.

930
00:55:53.166 --> 00:55:54.416
In a minute.

931
00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:56.333
You okay?

932
00:55:58.166 --> 00:55:59.541
What did we talk about?

933
00:56:00.041 --> 00:56:01.708
I'm not here because of you.

934
00:56:01.791 --> 00:56:03.958
-I'm trying a partnership.
-Really?

935
00:56:04.041 --> 00:56:06.916
Yeah. If what I'm doing here
wasn't so important.

936
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000
I'd go and leave you both alone.

937
00:56:09.083 --> 00:56:13.208
By the way. keep cool.
I won't bother you or Dr. Tawan.

938
00:56:14.333 --> 00:56:15.250
-Shall we?
-Yes.

939
00:56:31.208 --> 00:56:34.541
She says they're accepting
a new member in the community.

940
00:56:34.625 --> 00:56:37.208
A Perkassan who proved to be valuable
for the collective.

941
00:56:37.291 --> 00:56:38.625
Wunin.

942
00:56:43.916 --> 00:56:45.333
Is this Tekassan Teto?

943
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:52.125
-Are you translating this correctly?
-Do you doubt it?

944
00:57:01.375 --> 00:57:02.416
It's Teto.

945
00:57:04.250 --> 00:57:06.875
-What's this?
-A sign of trust.

946
00:57:06.958 --> 00:57:09.583
The eyes are the only parts
of the body that don't lie.

947
00:57:15.625 --> 00:57:17.208
Welcome to the community.

948
00:57:22.666 --> 00:57:24.666
Thank you. friends!

949
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.541
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

950
00:58:19.583 --> 00:58:21.416
Hi there. Is everything okay?

951
00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:23.250
Pretty good.

952
00:58:25.208 --> 00:58:27.916
You're missing the steps.
That's not sertanejo.

953
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.583
Now it's forró. I can dance forró.

954
00:58:45.375 --> 00:58:48.750
We work so hard.
and you're the one getting a party.

955
00:58:48.833 --> 00:58:51.416
-What can I do?
-You'll never change.

956
00:58:52.166 --> 00:58:53.250
I do change.

957
00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:56.333
I'm trying to change for the better.

958
00:59:03.875 --> 00:59:05.666
-I'll be back to make the bandage.
-Bye.

959
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:07.125
-Bye.
-Is it over?

960
00:59:07.208 --> 00:59:08.125
-Okay?
-Okay.

961
00:59:08.208 --> 00:59:10.583
Tawan. are you leaving?

962
00:59:11.125 --> 00:59:13.833
I'm going to take these tests
to Porto Remanso.

963
00:59:14.541 --> 00:59:16.833
I have a Kakydan project meeting.

964
00:59:16.916 --> 00:59:17.750
Nice.

965
00:59:19.291 --> 00:59:22.583
We ended up not talking afterward.

966
00:59:22.666 --> 00:59:23.541
Anyway.

967
00:59:24.208 --> 00:59:25.541
Our kiss.

968
00:59:25.625 --> 00:59:27.541
And I wanted…

969
00:59:28.375 --> 00:59:29.375
-To talk--
-Paula.

970
00:59:30.666 --> 00:59:31.750
I'm sorry.

971
00:59:32.666 --> 00:59:34.833
I'm really sorry. I think…

972
00:59:35.833 --> 00:59:39.166
I got too excited
due to Tapuya's recovery. I don't know.

973
00:59:39.708 --> 00:59:42.250
-I ended up mixing things up.
-Me too.

974
00:59:42.333 --> 00:59:43.458
I kissed you. too.

975
00:59:45.083 --> 00:59:45.958
Oh. Tawan.

976
00:59:46.875 --> 00:59:48.541
You and I would be perfect.

977
00:59:50.125 --> 00:59:51.041
-Yeah.
-Really.

978
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.625
But we don't choose. do we?

979
00:59:55.708 --> 00:59:56.916
These things.

980
00:59:57.416 --> 01:00:01.208
I just don't want to lose our friendship.
our partnership.

981
01:00:01.291 --> 01:00:03.291
That's what matters most to me.

982
01:00:04.708 --> 01:00:05.541
Okay.

983
01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:20.250
-Bye.
-Good luck. Take care!

984
01:00:21.791 --> 01:00:22.625
Bye!

985
01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:27.750
I wasn't after you.

986
01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.500
-I was getting some cassava.
-Hi. Teto.

987
01:00:30.583 --> 01:00:32.166
I'm just passing by.

988
01:00:37.208 --> 01:00:40.458
I want you to know that I respect you.

989
01:00:40.541 --> 01:00:43.666
I respect what you have with Tawan.
It's all good.

990
01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:47.375
I won't tell you I like it.
but I don't have to like anything.

991
01:00:47.458 --> 01:00:50.458
I've got to respect it
and hope you'll be happy.

992
01:00:50.541 --> 01:00:52.541
-Because if you like him…
-I like you.

993
01:00:56.541 --> 01:00:57.375
I love you.

994
01:00:59.125 --> 01:01:00.125
But is it worth it?

995
01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:03.333
To insist on a relationship
that isn't working?

996
01:01:03.416 --> 01:01:05.375
Do you think it's not worth it?

997
01:01:05.458 --> 01:01:08.458
Teto. I love seeing you grow up.

998
01:01:09.458 --> 01:01:12.375
Really. It's one of the things that
I admire in you the most.

999
01:01:12.458 --> 01:01:15.916
Your willingness to change and evolve.

1000
01:01:17.291 --> 01:01:20.125
But I can't feel that's just
because of me. you know?

1001
01:01:20.208 --> 01:01:24.041
-I don't want to carry this weight.
-It's not just because of you.

1002
01:01:25.833 --> 01:01:28.458
What's important is
to know who I want to be.

1003
01:01:28.541 --> 01:01:30.083
Actually. who I can be.

1004
01:01:31.125 --> 01:01:32.250
There's no weight.

1005
01:01:33.333 --> 01:01:35.666
Thank you for helping me with this.

1006
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:36.583
Thank you.

1007
01:01:39.166 --> 01:01:40.041
That's great.

1008
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:43.083
Come to this place with me?

1009
01:01:44.875 --> 01:01:45.708
It's special.

1010
01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:49.416
Look.

1011
01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:52.708
Isn't this special?

1012
01:01:55.666 --> 01:01:56.541
Very special.

1013
01:01:57.375 --> 01:01:58.208
Come.

1014
01:02:14.375 --> 01:02:15.208
Come.

1015
01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:17.333
Come.

1016
01:02:20.375 --> 01:02:22.583
I want to believe you so badly.

1017
01:02:23.958 --> 01:02:24.875
So badly.

1018
01:02:26.875 --> 01:02:29.791
How do I know this isn't
another character you're creating

1019
01:02:29.875 --> 01:02:30.791
to deceive me?

1020
01:02:39.250 --> 01:02:40.416
I learned this.

1021
01:02:43.541 --> 01:02:46.208
The eye is the only part of the body
that doesn't lie.

1022
01:02:49.208 --> 01:02:50.458
Paula. I promise you.

1023
01:02:51.291 --> 01:02:54.708
I promise I'll never try to control you.

1024
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:56.875
I promise.

1025
01:03:26.166 --> 01:03:27.666
It's slippery.

1026
01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:30.958
-Be careful.
-Go!

1027
01:03:32.041 --> 01:03:34.166
-Wait. Did you hear that?
-Yes.

1028
01:03:34.250 --> 01:03:35.375
Push it!

1029
01:03:35.458 --> 01:03:37.125
-That's weird.
-Come.

1030
01:03:39.708 --> 01:03:40.875
Go!

1031
01:03:40.958 --> 01:03:42.833
-Come on!
-Let's go!

1032
01:03:42.916 --> 01:03:44.291
-Come on!
-Push it!

1033
01:03:48.250 --> 01:03:49.208
Sorry!

1034
01:03:49.291 --> 01:03:51.833
-Come on!
-Let's go. Push it!

1035
01:03:52.541 --> 01:03:53.375
Slow down!

1036
01:03:53.458 --> 01:03:56.708
I know those two.
They were sick some time ago.

1037
01:03:58.083 --> 01:03:59.583
Push! Come on!

1038
01:04:03.916 --> 01:04:04.750
Come on.

1039
01:04:12.125 --> 01:04:13.500
Come on. man. Get to work.

1040
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:17.375
Get down. you guys.

1041
01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:20.708
Careful with the sieve.

1042
01:04:20.791 --> 01:04:23.583
-That's what's making people sick.
-What?

1043
01:04:23.666 --> 01:04:25.583
This mercury. It's too toxic.

1044
01:04:25.666 --> 01:04:27.708
It contaminates our water. our food.

1045
01:04:27.791 --> 01:04:29.916
Do they know what they're doing?

1046
01:04:30.875 --> 01:04:32.333
That ring you bought

1047
01:04:32.416 --> 01:04:34.333
probably came from a mine like this.

1048
01:04:34.416 --> 01:04:36.541
-I didn't even think of that.
-If you don't think.

1049
01:04:36.625 --> 01:04:38.416
let alone the people
who need this to live.

1050
01:04:49.666 --> 01:04:51.791
My God. Everaldo.

1051
01:04:51.875 --> 01:04:53.458
Everaldo from EverNorte?

1052
01:04:54.291 --> 01:04:57.166
Didn't your dad say he got rich
from selling expensive tomatoes?

1053
01:04:57.250 --> 01:04:59.500
I think he makes money from actual gold.

1054
01:05:02.125 --> 01:05:03.041
I'll be right back.

1055
01:05:03.625 --> 01:05:04.916
Teto!

1056
01:05:18.416 --> 01:05:21.083
-Welcome. my friend.
-Thank you. buddy.

1057
01:05:25.833 --> 01:05:26.958
Let's go after him.

1058
01:05:29.333 --> 01:05:32.208
We'll buy the machine with your investment

1059
01:05:32.291 --> 01:05:34.291
to expand the excavation area.

1060
01:05:34.791 --> 01:05:36.875
And to pay bribes. right?

1061
01:05:36.958 --> 01:05:39.125
Regulate our scheme.

1062
01:05:39.208 --> 01:05:43.291
What about the tomato co-op
that they want to install in the region?

1063
01:05:43.375 --> 01:05:44.583
-Is that an issue?
-Teto!

1064
01:05:44.666 --> 01:05:46.333
-You scared me!
-Let's go now!

1065
01:05:46.416 --> 01:05:48.916
-This is dangerous.
-He's talking about Teto Fresco.

1066
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.708
Now I see why he wanted
to buy our company.

1067
01:05:51.791 --> 01:05:54.208
And sign the Teto Fresco buyout tonight.

1068
01:05:54.291 --> 01:05:57.708
The Trancoso owner is someone I trust.
Just relax.

1069
01:05:57.791 --> 01:05:58.625
Okay.

1070
01:06:00.250 --> 01:06:01.333
Let him in.

1071
01:06:02.166 --> 01:06:04.625
-See you.
-I can explain.

1072
01:06:05.250 --> 01:06:06.166
Relax.

1073
01:06:07.583 --> 01:06:08.916
-Afternoon.
-Afternoon.

1074
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.875
I'm sorry I asked you to come here
to get the sponsorship money.

1075
01:06:12.958 --> 01:06:15.500
But we need to have a serious talk.

1076
01:06:16.083 --> 01:06:19.750
You sent some blood tests
to the health department.

1077
01:06:20.625 --> 01:06:21.666
Why?

1078
01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:23.750
It's my job to do that.

1079
01:06:23.833 --> 01:06:27.833
There have been many people
with serious symptoms at the clinic.

1080
01:06:27.916 --> 01:06:30.875
I believe this is because of the mercury
you have been using here.

1081
01:06:30.958 --> 01:06:33.875
Tawan. as you can see.

1082
01:06:33.958 --> 01:06:36.708
mercury manipulation pays your salary.

1083
01:06:37.291 --> 01:06:38.833
So. do me a favor.

1084
01:06:38.916 --> 01:06:42.916
Until our mining is regulated.
according to the law.

1085
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.375
I don't want you
to attract unnecessary attention.

1086
01:06:49.958 --> 01:06:51.750
Next year. I promise you.

1087
01:06:51.833 --> 01:06:54.875
you'll be the one receiving
the Friend of The Forest award.

1088
01:06:54.958 --> 01:06:57.958
We'll dedicate a hospital
with the name of your project.

1089
01:06:58.041 --> 01:07:00.500
sponsored by EverNorte.

1090
01:07:00.583 --> 01:07:02.666
But until then. you'll keep quiet.

1091
01:07:03.166 --> 01:07:05.541
And ask your doctors to keep quiet. too.

1092
01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:07.083
Agreed.

1093
01:07:07.166 --> 01:07:10.625
I have another simple request
regarding Dr. Paula.

1094
01:07:11.916 --> 01:07:13.458
Send her back to Rio.

1095
01:07:14.291 --> 01:07:17.791
Actually. Teto. her boyfriend.
is the one who asked me this.

1096
01:07:17.875 --> 01:07:20.916
Because she was supposed
to be getting married. you know?

1097
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.333
Taking care of her family.

1098
01:07:22.416 --> 01:07:24.625
Calm down. I can explain that. too.

1099
01:07:32.208 --> 01:07:34.541
I thought you wanted to stay.
I did it to help you.

1100
01:07:34.625 --> 01:07:37.000
Help me? You didn't want to help me.

1101
01:07:37.083 --> 01:07:39.583
I don't want to hear it
because that's my mistake.

1102
01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:42.750
I should have realized it
the first time you lied to me.

1103
01:07:43.833 --> 01:07:44.916
Forgive me.

1104
01:07:46.166 --> 01:07:47.500
I've already forgiven you.

1105
01:07:48.708 --> 01:07:51.625
I've forgiven you. but then you go
and do something even worse.

1106
01:07:52.750 --> 01:07:55.083
Then you come all sweet
and say you've changed.

1107
01:07:55.625 --> 01:07:57.000
To deceive me again. right?

1108
01:07:57.083 --> 01:07:58.333
Wunin!

1109
01:08:11.583 --> 01:08:13.541
Wunin. please listen to me.

1110
01:08:15.166 --> 01:08:17.208
I have no time to listen to your lies.

1111
01:08:17.708 --> 01:08:21.500
You're sided with those Perkassan
who brought the mining here.

1112
01:08:21.583 --> 01:08:23.333
Now we only have two options.

1113
01:08:23.416 --> 01:08:26.000
Leave our sacred land
or stay here and die.

1114
01:08:26.083 --> 01:08:28.416
-I can explain.
-Leave! It's your fault.

1115
01:08:29.166 --> 01:08:31.291
My folks told me not to trust you.

1116
01:08:31.875 --> 01:08:34.250
Wunin. Why will you have to leave?

1117
01:08:34.333 --> 01:08:35.333
Pawi was kidnapped.

1118
01:08:36.250 --> 01:08:39.791
They always wanted to start a mine here.
They'll only release him if we leave.

1119
01:08:39.875 --> 01:08:42.541
Calm down. Let's go up there. Come on.

1120
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.041
-Hi. Igor.
-Hi. Teto.

1121
01:08:50.125 --> 01:08:52.541
I just want to let you know
we're arriving in Manaus

1122
01:08:52.625 --> 01:08:54.625
to close the sale of Teto Fresco.

1123
01:08:54.708 --> 01:08:57.000
Don't do it.
You don't know who Everaldo is.

1124
01:08:57.083 --> 01:08:58.750
-He's a dangerous guy.
-Okay.

1125
01:08:58.833 --> 01:09:01.166
I know nothing and you know it all.

1126
01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:03.166
You gotta meet Monique and me.

1127
01:09:03.250 --> 01:09:06.041
We gotta sign the contract
before the meeting.

1128
01:09:06.125 --> 01:09:07.541
A meeting with Everaldo?

1129
01:09:10.750 --> 01:09:13.333
I'll go to the meeting.
but can I pick the place?

1130
01:09:13.833 --> 01:09:17.833
Wunin. Paula. I know I disappointed you.
But I meant to help!

1131
01:09:17.916 --> 01:09:19.958
No! I don't trust you anymore.

1132
01:09:20.041 --> 01:09:22.083
I know how to fix this.
but it must be now.

1133
01:09:22.166 --> 01:09:24.333
If you don't want
to see me ever again. fine.

1134
01:09:24.416 --> 01:09:25.833
You don't. That's it.

1135
01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.333
Tell us. What are you thinking?

1136
01:09:32.458 --> 01:09:33.916
Do you know what a cacuri is?

1137
01:09:34.958 --> 01:09:38.166
Where are you. Teto?
Everaldo is coming over.

1138
01:09:38.250 --> 01:09:40.291
-I'll kill him.
-What do we do now?

1139
01:09:55.625 --> 01:09:56.958
Teto Trancoso.

1140
01:09:59.291 --> 01:10:01.041
You seem nervous. What's up?

1141
01:10:02.041 --> 01:10:04.625
The security guards make us nervous.

1142
01:10:05.375 --> 01:10:08.666
Your money is here. We must be careful.

1143
01:10:09.250 --> 01:10:12.208
They'll be on standby at the pier.

1144
01:10:13.458 --> 01:10:15.250
-Shall we go?
-Let's go.

1145
01:10:16.291 --> 01:10:17.583
-Come. baby.
-Let's go.

1146
01:10:19.166 --> 01:10:21.125
Where are your partners?

1147
01:10:21.208 --> 01:10:24.458
Monique has already signed.
and Igor is coming.

1148
01:10:31.291 --> 01:10:32.416
Done.

1149
01:10:40.916 --> 01:10:41.833
Done.

1150
01:10:43.875 --> 01:10:45.333
Let's wait for Igor.

1151
01:10:45.416 --> 01:10:49.083
Two partners are enough.
You're the majority. Please sign.

1152
01:10:59.583 --> 01:11:01.166
Turn that down!

1153
01:11:06.208 --> 01:11:07.958
Stop right there. Everaldo!

1154
01:11:09.083 --> 01:11:11.166
-Igor?
-Tell your guys to stay away.

1155
01:11:16.041 --> 01:11:16.875
Take us to Hipanaa.

1156
01:11:27.791 --> 01:11:29.958
-What's all this?
-Take it easy.

1157
01:11:30.041 --> 01:11:32.416
-What's going on?
-Everaldo's a criminal.

1158
01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:35.166
He uses the tomato thing as a front
for his illegal mining.

1159
01:11:35.250 --> 01:11:37.416
-Dad?
-That's bullshit.

1160
01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:39.083
They want to cause trouble.

1161
01:11:39.166 --> 01:11:42.125
No one wants that. We want to make a deal.

1162
01:11:42.208 --> 01:11:43.750
What deal? I don't get it.

1163
01:11:43.833 --> 01:11:46.833
Your illegal mining guys
invaded the Hipanaa community.

1164
01:11:46.916 --> 01:11:48.250
They took one of us.

1165
01:11:48.333 --> 01:11:52.666
Just release him safe and sound.
and we'll let you go.

1166
01:11:52.750 --> 01:11:54.875
I have no business with that.

1167
01:11:54.958 --> 01:11:57.833
You either do that.
or we take you to the police.

1168
01:11:58.583 --> 01:12:02.833
Teto. do something about this.
Send this asshole away now.

1169
01:12:02.916 --> 01:12:05.041
You'll lose half of your inheritance.

1170
01:12:05.791 --> 01:12:07.208
What's he talking about?

1171
01:12:07.708 --> 01:12:10.666
Hey. Teto.
Do you want me to tell Igor our secret?

1172
01:12:10.750 --> 01:12:12.125
I'm Teto. stupid.

1173
01:12:12.208 --> 01:12:14.166
I have no secrets with Igor.
We're brothers.

1174
01:12:16.708 --> 01:12:18.500
Actually. I'm your uncle.

1175
01:12:20.916 --> 01:12:22.625
He told me that. thinking I was you.

1176
01:12:22.708 --> 01:12:23.958
He wants us to fight.

1177
01:12:24.041 --> 01:12:25.083
Half of my inheritance?

1178
01:12:25.166 --> 01:12:27.666
If you're my uncle.
you have half of my dad's fortune.

1179
01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:29.458
You're richer than me. It's all good.

1180
01:12:29.541 --> 01:12:31.083
I don't even know if that's true.

1181
01:12:31.166 --> 01:12:34.250
It doesn't matter if it isn't true.
I'll support you anyway.

1182
01:12:36.166 --> 01:12:37.041
Uncle.

1183
01:12:37.125 --> 01:12:39.500
What's happening?
Why didn't you say anything?

1184
01:12:39.583 --> 01:12:40.708
He tried to.

1185
01:12:41.208 --> 01:12:43.500
But all we thought of
was Everaldo's money.

1186
01:12:43.583 --> 01:12:45.375
Okay. so come on now. Hurry!

1187
01:12:45.458 --> 01:12:46.458
What's up?

1188
01:12:46.541 --> 01:12:48.500
It's done. They're on their way.

1189
01:12:49.291 --> 01:12:50.166
But look.

1190
01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:54.041
You had no right to involve me in this.
you know?

1191
01:12:54.125 --> 01:12:58.125
Whatever they do there is not my problem.
I'm just an investor.

1192
01:12:58.208 --> 01:13:02.541
-I thought tomatoes were your business.
-You can grow any tomatoes you want. kid.

1193
01:13:03.041 --> 01:13:04.250
Gold is worth much more.

1194
01:13:04.333 --> 01:13:05.791
More than people's lives?

1195
01:13:05.875 --> 01:13:07.541
More than a clear conscience. Dad?

1196
01:13:07.625 --> 01:13:09.458
Don't be naive. Solange.

1197
01:13:09.541 --> 01:13:11.541
If I don't start a mine.
someone else will.

1198
01:13:12.125 --> 01:13:15.000
What do you want? To help the population?

1199
01:13:15.083 --> 01:13:16.041
Wait.

1200
01:13:16.583 --> 01:13:17.666
I had no idea.

1201
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:19.750
Take it. It's yours.

1202
01:13:22.916 --> 01:13:26.916
I bet you'll solve lots of problems
in your village.

1203
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.833
This won't solve a thing.
My community is not the only one here.

1204
01:13:30.916 --> 01:13:33.166
There are hundreds of peoples
living collectively.

1205
01:13:34.916 --> 01:13:37.291
Look. Pay attention.

1206
01:13:38.208 --> 01:13:42.333
If I expose all of Trancoso's stuff.
you'll lose everything.

1207
01:13:43.083 --> 01:13:43.916
Do it.

1208
01:13:47.166 --> 01:13:48.375
That's Pawi.

1209
01:13:49.583 --> 01:13:50.625
I'll go get him.

1210
01:13:54.083 --> 01:13:56.208
Take everyone to Hipanaa.
I'll be there soon.

1211
01:14:02.208 --> 01:14:03.583
Are you coming?

1212
01:14:05.083 --> 01:14:07.333
Solange. what are you doing?

1213
01:14:07.416 --> 01:14:09.916
Didn't you tell me to make new friends?

1214
01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:10.875
I did.

1215
01:14:13.166 --> 01:14:14.083
Go.

1216
01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:24.166
Come on. Teto. They've got Pawi.

1217
01:14:24.250 --> 01:14:25.416
-Hey!
-You stay!

1218
01:14:26.250 --> 01:14:27.083
What's that about?

1219
01:14:27.166 --> 01:14:31.583
You've kidnapped me.
If I shoot. no one can complain.

1220
01:14:31.666 --> 01:14:35.750
You treat me as if you were better
than me. But you owe me everything.

1221
01:14:35.833 --> 01:14:38.041
-I'm not my grandfather.
-Teto!

1222
01:14:55.708 --> 01:14:57.416
-Lay down.
-Be careful.

1223
01:14:58.333 --> 01:15:00.583
-Calm down.
-Careful

1224
01:15:03.541 --> 01:15:05.708
I'll make a bandage to stop the bleeding.

1225
01:15:05.791 --> 01:15:08.625
-Be careful. it hurts.
-I know.

1226
01:15:12.625 --> 01:15:14.083
This will help with the pain.

1227
01:15:23.375 --> 01:15:25.250
-I love you.
-Me too.

1228
01:15:26.083 --> 01:15:27.333
I love you. too.

1229
01:15:27.416 --> 01:15:30.333
He'll be okay. He has protection paint on.

1230
01:15:44.083 --> 01:15:44.958
What's up?

1231
01:15:45.458 --> 01:15:48.375
Now we have to wait. He's sleeping.

1232
01:15:49.166 --> 01:15:50.791
We've done all we could.

1233
01:15:54.625 --> 01:15:55.625
Paula?

1234
01:16:02.791 --> 01:16:03.833
What happened?

1235
01:16:04.833 --> 01:16:06.875
Your partner shot Teto.

1236
01:16:06.958 --> 01:16:09.416
-Teto was shot? What partner?
-Everaldo.

1237
01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:12.166
-He isn't my partner.
-What do you mean?

1238
01:16:14.833 --> 01:16:15.916
Here.

1239
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.875
Mercury manipulation pays your salary.

1240
01:16:20.708 --> 01:16:22.083
So. do me a favor.

1241
01:16:22.166 --> 01:16:25.708
-Well done!
-to attract unnecessary…

1242
01:16:25.791 --> 01:16:26.958
It's trending.

1243
01:16:27.041 --> 01:16:28.625
We must thank the folks.

1244
01:16:28.708 --> 01:16:32.916
Until our mining is regulated.
according to the law.

1245
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.458
what pays your salary is mercury…

1246
01:16:36.541 --> 01:16:40.083
I don't want you
to attract unnecessary attention.

1247
01:16:40.166 --> 01:16:43.333
After the release of
the bribery attempt video.

1248
01:16:43.416 --> 01:16:48.250
the Court sent an arrest warrant
to Everaldo Coimbra.

1249
01:16:48.333 --> 01:16:51.166
He's been accused
of sponsoring illegal mining.

1250
01:16:51.250 --> 01:16:55.250
The police had a search warrant
for Everaldo's mansion.

1251
01:16:55.333 --> 01:16:57.750
-Ouch!
-What is it. Alana? Is it the baby?

1252
01:16:57.833 --> 01:17:00.791
No. the baby's fine.
I just can't watch this scene.

1253
01:17:00.875 --> 01:17:03.125
-Pregnant women can't watch violence.
-It's not that.

1254
01:17:03.208 --> 01:17:06.041
I hate seeing all that money
go down the drain.

1255
01:17:06.125 --> 01:17:07.458
-Son!
-Hi. Mom.

1256
01:17:07.541 --> 01:17:09.250
Guys. let's go.

1257
01:17:09.333 --> 01:17:12.208
-The baby shower guests are here.
-Don't help me.

1258
01:17:12.291 --> 01:17:14.208
I'll get up on my own. Let's go!

1259
01:17:14.291 --> 01:17:16.333
I'm pregnant. not dead.

1260
01:17:16.416 --> 01:17:17.750
Igor!

1261
01:17:21.375 --> 01:17:23.666
-Mr. Teodoro.
-Don't call me mister.

1262
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:25.125
Call me Teodoro.

1263
01:17:25.208 --> 01:17:28.375
Or call me Teo. brother. little bro.

1264
01:17:28.458 --> 01:17:30.250
Dad. don't push it.

1265
01:17:30.750 --> 01:17:33.458
I picked something
thinking that you'll need

1266
01:17:33.541 --> 01:17:35.833
to transport my nephew comfortably.

1267
01:17:36.333 --> 01:17:37.833
Teto. go get the surprise.

1268
01:17:37.916 --> 01:17:40.500
He's giving you a car!

1269
01:17:41.083 --> 01:17:43.375
-You didn't need to.
-Nonsense.

1270
01:17:43.458 --> 01:17:46.541
People give
what their hearts tell them to.

1271
01:17:47.833 --> 01:17:48.958
Surprise!

1272
01:17:50.333 --> 01:17:52.958
-I love it!
-I know you'll need a big car.

1273
01:17:53.541 --> 01:17:55.333
But Igor is a Trancoso. now.

1274
01:17:55.416 --> 01:17:58.333
When you take over the vice presidency.

1275
01:17:58.416 --> 01:18:00.375
you can pick any car you wish.

1276
01:18:03.208 --> 01:18:04.041
Teo.

1277
01:18:04.916 --> 01:18:07.291
I'm honored. but I can't accept.

1278
01:18:08.208 --> 01:18:09.791
Alana and I agreed that

1279
01:18:09.875 --> 01:18:14.375
she'll work. and I'll take care of the kid
while finishing my college thesis.

1280
01:18:14.958 --> 01:18:16.666
-What do we do now?
-Don't look at me.

1281
01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:19.583
We have a great executive
right in front of you.

1282
01:18:20.250 --> 01:18:21.333
-Me?
-Yes.

1283
01:18:21.833 --> 01:18:24.500
Now I'm the CEO of Teto Fresco.
and I have lots of work.

1284
01:18:24.583 --> 01:18:27.000
The stakeholders want a new face
for the company.

1285
01:18:27.083 --> 01:18:29.250
Well. if we have neither Monique

1286
01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.791
nor Igor. there's still…

1287
01:18:33.791 --> 01:18:35.708
Who's still there?

1288
01:18:35.791 --> 01:18:38.208
Didn't you want this position
to be within the family?

1289
01:18:38.291 --> 01:18:40.458
-Choose the auntie here.
-Auntie?

1290
01:18:40.541 --> 01:18:42.583
Don't even think about it!

1291
01:18:43.708 --> 01:18:48.666
ONE YEAR LATER

1292
01:18:54.833 --> 01:18:56.041
I can't. Sorry.

1293
01:18:56.125 --> 01:18:58.916
Come on. Monique. You've got to help me.

1294
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.041
I thought you'd be happy

1295
01:19:01.125 --> 01:19:03.708
that Trancoso is buying tomatoes
from Teto Fresco again.

1296
01:19:03.791 --> 01:19:07.541
Calm down. Alana.
The Rio de Janeiro production is sold out.

1297
01:19:07.625 --> 01:19:10.916
Things are great here in Amazonas.

1298
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000
I'm really happy.
but there's a lot on my plate.

1299
01:19:14.083 --> 01:19:15.750
Still no news from Teto?

1300
01:19:15.833 --> 01:19:18.958
We haven't heard from him in a long time.

1301
01:19:19.458 --> 01:19:21.791
Igor is on paternity leave.
and you're at Trancoso.

1302
01:19:21.875 --> 01:19:23.041
so I'm in charge.

1303
01:19:23.125 --> 01:19:26.041
You're my son's godmother.
you've got to help me.

1304
01:19:26.125 --> 01:19:29.416
Can you sell us
at least 4.000 tons of tomatoes?

1305
01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:33.083
Sister-in-law. I don't even know
what to tell you. Bye!

1306
01:19:33.583 --> 01:19:34.791
My love.

1307
01:19:34.875 --> 01:19:35.958
Hi. babe!

1308
01:19:36.041 --> 01:19:40.083
2.000 tons and it's a done deal.
Half of it. come on.

1309
01:19:40.583 --> 01:19:41.500
Monique?

1310
01:19:43.583 --> 01:19:45.916
-How was the show?
-It was beautiful.

1311
01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Everything okay here?

1312
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.041
Alana. the tomato queen.
won't leave me alone.

1313
01:19:51.333 --> 01:19:53.166
-Will you pick up?
-Not now.

1314
01:19:53.666 --> 01:19:56.875
By the way. have you seen the sun?
It's 10:30 a.m.

1315
01:19:57.791 --> 01:19:58.916
It's hammock time.

1316
01:20:00.041 --> 01:20:02.041
-How's the nausea?
-Much better.

1317
01:20:02.125 --> 01:20:04.125
Great. Thanks to Wunin.

1318
01:20:04.208 --> 01:20:06.583
Her medicine and care made a difference.

1319
01:20:06.666 --> 01:20:09.125
-How's the baby?
-It'll be born healthy.

1320
01:20:10.125 --> 01:20:13.083
Another valuable member
is joining our community.

1321
01:20:13.166 --> 01:20:15.291
Good afternoon. folks.

1322
01:20:15.375 --> 01:20:16.416
-What's up?
-Hey!

1323
01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:18.750
Test results have improved a lot
around here.

1324
01:20:18.833 --> 01:20:19.666
Really?

1325
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:22.625
Mercury contamination
has dropped considerably.

1326
01:20:22.708 --> 01:20:25.000
-Great!
-Right? Mission accomplished.

1327
01:20:26.291 --> 01:20:29.083
How about you?
Do you know what you'll do now?

1328
01:20:41.708 --> 01:20:42.750
Hello there!

1329
01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:44.083
Hello.

1330
01:20:44.875 --> 01:20:47.041
-Are you Tuiré?
-Yes. Dr. Paula?

1331
01:20:47.125 --> 01:20:49.750
Welcome to our community. Come in.

1332
01:20:58.291 --> 01:21:01.708
I'm not here after you.
Seriously. Believe me.

1333
01:21:02.458 --> 01:21:05.375
I think the forest spirits
brought you here.

1334
01:21:06.333 --> 01:21:07.708
Actually. it was Wunin.

1335
01:21:09.291 --> 01:21:11.125
She said you'd be around.

1336
01:21:11.875 --> 01:21:13.125
But didn't say why.

1337
01:21:14.583 --> 01:21:15.875
I'll show you.

1338
01:21:17.041 --> 01:21:19.958
I've been trying to find this
for quite some time.

1339
01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:21.166
Have you found it?

1340
01:21:23.291 --> 01:21:24.250
Look at this.

1341
01:21:25.375 --> 01:21:28.625
Really. Teto?
You came all the way here for a tomato!

1342
01:21:28.708 --> 01:21:32.708
No. I came here because I needed
a new purpose in my life.

1343
01:21:34.083 --> 01:21:35.750
I keep trying to evolve.

1344
01:21:36.958 --> 01:21:40.250
-To see if I deserve you.
-Don't say that.

1345
01:21:40.750 --> 01:21:42.458
I know I'm too harsh.

1346
01:21:42.541 --> 01:21:45.333
I'm too hard on myself.
and not even I can handle it.

1347
01:21:47.666 --> 01:21:50.500
But you've shown me that
we're here to learn.

1348
01:21:50.583 --> 01:21:51.500
To improve.

1349
01:21:52.375 --> 01:21:54.125
You brought tenderness into my life.

1350
01:21:54.625 --> 01:21:55.541
Happiness.

1351
01:21:56.791 --> 01:21:58.791
Even in the smallest details.

1352
01:21:58.875 --> 01:22:01.416
How can someone be so excited
over a tomato?

1353
01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:03.833
But you haven't tried it. Try it.

1354
01:22:03.916 --> 01:22:05.583
-Please.
-Hold up.

1355
01:22:08.208 --> 01:22:09.708
-What do you think?
-Incredible!

1356
01:22:12.333 --> 01:22:15.208
The true wealth of this forest
is like this.

1357
01:22:16.541 --> 01:22:20.041
Living in harmony with what's around.
Nature. people. and cultures.

1358
01:22:20.625 --> 01:22:21.791
True.

1359
01:22:21.875 --> 01:22:25.208
This tomato may be a chance
for us to show this to the whole world.

1360
01:22:25.291 --> 01:22:27.958
You're so stuck up.
You want to make this tomato global.

1361
01:22:28.041 --> 01:22:31.833
No. First I'll take it to Wunin.
back to her community.

1362
01:22:32.333 --> 01:22:35.458
Then. if they let me.
I'll take it wherever you are.

1363
01:22:35.541 --> 01:22:36.750
Of course. if you want to.

1364
01:22:38.250 --> 01:22:39.375
Do you know what I want?

1365
01:27:56.583 --> 01:27:59.583
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ANY SIMILARITY TO NAMES.

1366
