3
00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:11.250
The 2000 election
was a street brawl

4
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.583
for the presidency
of the United States.

5
00:00:14.291 --> 00:00:17.917
What happened in Miami
changed this country. forever.

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.417
While Democrats wanted
to do the right thing.

7
00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:23.875
Republicans wanted to win.

8
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:27.417
The election was lost
in many different places.

9
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.458
But it was stolen in Miami.

10
00:00:54.291 --> 00:00:58.041
...Branch One or Battalion 44.

11
00:00:58.125 --> 00:01:00.333
Get ahold of OES there
at the command post

12
00:01:00.417 --> 00:01:02.041
and let's push it
all the way out

13
00:01:02.125 --> 00:01:03.917
to the edge of the city
of Ventura.

14
00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:10.250
Take a look at this.
It has exploded into 500 acres.

15
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:13.125
These high winds.
not so good with the helicopter.

16
00:01:13.208 --> 00:01:14.542
We're working our way
over there.

17
00:01:14.625 --> 00:01:15.709
but we can tell you

18
00:01:15.792 --> 00:01:18.500
that this is burning very close
to Santa Paula.

19
00:01:18.583 --> 00:01:21.250
It's right off the 126
and the 150.

20
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:24.959
The 150 is actually the road
that takes you to Ojai.

21
00:01:26.875 --> 00:01:29.166
Just wanna make sure
you're aware of the fire.

22
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.583
It's moving at
a rapid rate of spread.

23
00:01:37.125 --> 00:01:40.583
There's
Thomas Aquinas University
that's in that area.

24
00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:42.792
That's where
it's getting the name.

25
00:01:42.875 --> 00:01:45.625
Now. there are plenty of homes
in this area as well.

26
00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:48.375
If they are not evacuating.
they will be told to.

27
00:01:48.458 --> 00:01:52.250
Obviously. life foremost.
property second.

28
00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:54.750
-I'm in a bad spot. ooh.
- As we understood it

29
00:01:54.834 --> 00:01:56.375
listening to
some scanner traffic.

30
00:01:56.458 --> 00:01:58.667
they could not get
enough resources

31
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.291
to this fire fast enough.

32
00:02:02.291 --> 00:02:03.917
There's helicopters in the air.

33
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.583
there's ground crews
on the ground.

34
00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:07.750
but the high winds this evening.

35
00:02:07.834 --> 00:02:09.750
along with the dry temperatures.

36
00:02:09.834 --> 00:02:13.458
has made this into a huge fire.
and these flames continue

37
00:02:13.542 --> 00:02:15.625
just to gobble up acreage
out here

38
00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.625
and keep moving out
to the west.

39
00:02:51.041 --> 00:02:52.583
What are you making?

40
00:02:52.667 --> 00:02:56.208
NOÉMIE DUMONT MILANO:
I'm making a cheese-slash-potato
French dish...

41
00:02:56.291 --> 00:02:59.417
that I'm gonna make my husband
for the first time tonight.

42
00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:02.625
on the 3rd of December.

43
00:03:06.917 --> 00:03:08.291
Go.

44
00:03:08.375 --> 00:03:10.041
We met in San Francisco.

45
00:03:10.917 --> 00:03:13.917
We fell in love and got married.

46
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:19.625
When I was around
five months pregnant.

47
00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.834
we decided to explore California

48
00:03:21.917 --> 00:03:23.792
in the hope
to find the right place

49
00:03:23.875 --> 00:03:25.250
to raise our little girl.

50
00:03:26.417 --> 00:03:28.875
As we learned
more and more about California.

51
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.458
people kept telling us about
this special place called Ojai.

52
00:03:34.166 --> 00:03:36.792
There is a place

53
00:03:36.875 --> 00:03:40.083
that everybody finds
in this valley

54
00:03:40.166 --> 00:03:41.959
that is home to them.

55
00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.792
I grew up here
in the Ojai Valley.

56
00:03:46.875 --> 00:03:50.333
"Ojai" is a Chumash word.
and it's a village

57
00:03:50.417 --> 00:03:52.375
that's up here
in this upper valley.

58
00:03:52.458 --> 00:03:55.500
And it means "moon"
or "lunar phase."

59
00:03:58.291 --> 00:04:00.875
So when you're up here
and the moon comes up.

60
00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.917
it's as if you could touch it.

61
00:04:05.375 --> 00:04:08.000
NOÉMIE: We just fell in love
with the weather.

62
00:04:08.083 --> 00:04:11.709
the flower. the smells.
and the animals.

63
00:04:17.333 --> 00:04:19.417
Maé was born
two months prematurely

64
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.583
and. uh. when we move to Ojai.
she was not even two months old.

65
00:04:23.667 --> 00:04:26.291
The size of a tiny
little human being.

66
00:04:26.375 --> 00:04:28.166
So as a new mom.

67
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.625
this move across California
was pretty rough on me.

68
00:04:32.709 --> 00:04:35.375
We moved here
about a month before the fire.

69
00:04:37.667 --> 00:04:39.250
A house directly on the edge

70
00:04:39.333 --> 00:04:41.500
of the Los Padres
National Forest.

71
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.375
High wind advisories
have all been upgraded
to all-out warnings

72
00:05:06.458 --> 00:05:10.625
as the dangerous Santa Ana winds
are blowing big time.

73
00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:12.625
NOÉMIE: Uh. I remember
telling myself.

74
00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:15.375
"What's going on
with this wind?"

75
00:05:15.458 --> 00:05:18.458
I went outside. I was like.

76
00:05:18.542 --> 00:05:19.959
"This is not normal."

77
00:05:20.041 --> 00:05:21.834
I just had a feeling.

78
00:05:21.917 --> 00:05:25.125
I knew that something bad
was gonna happen.

79
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.875
-911 OPERATOR: Fire paramedics.

80
00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:33.125
We were just sitting
out on the front porch

81
00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:36.750
and I noticed. uh.
an orange glow and smoke.

82
00:05:36.834 --> 00:05:39.083
It's really blowing up now.

83
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.542
We have a fire.
We are in a house here

84
00:05:44.625 --> 00:05:48.125
at Anlauf Canyon Road
above Steckel Park.

85
00:05:48.208 --> 00:05:50.250
911 OPERATOR:
Is your structure threatened?

86
00:05:50.333 --> 00:05:52.333
Yes. it is.

87
00:05:52.417 --> 00:05:54.875
The first engine that arrived

88
00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:56.333
was from Upper Ojai.

89
00:05:56.417 --> 00:05:57.834
The fire captain got in

90
00:05:57.917 --> 00:06:00.125
and he said. "Look.
it's in Anlauf Canyon.

91
00:06:00.208 --> 00:06:02.542
but we can't access it yet."

92
00:06:04.083 --> 00:06:06.417
It was a total envelopment

93
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.458
of Anlauf Canyon in flames.

94
00:06:08.542 --> 00:06:10.083
50 acres of hell.

95
00:06:10.166 --> 00:06:12.125
Basically. we had
about 30 engines ordered

96
00:06:12.208 --> 00:06:13.417
in the first 10 minutes.

97
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.625
Has anyone reported a fire?

98
00:06:19.709 --> 00:06:21.500
911 OPERATOR: Yes. ma'am. It was
Saint Thomas Aquinas College.

99
00:06:21.583 --> 00:06:22.709
that's--
that's where it started.

100
00:06:22.792 --> 00:06:24.208
We're almost next to them.

101
00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:26.000
-What should we do?
-911 OPERATOR: Yes. ma'am.

102
00:06:26.083 --> 00:06:27.792
You do what you feel is best.

103
00:06:27.875 --> 00:06:30.208
For the Highway 150 corridors.

104
00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:32.625
we move into Santa Paula
for immediate evacuation

105
00:06:32.709 --> 00:06:35.667
of approximately
500 residences.

106
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.834
Sheriff's office!

107
00:06:37.917 --> 00:06:40.125
-Fire!
-911 OPERATOR: Fire paramedics.

108
00:06:40.208 --> 00:06:42.667
We're on Wheeler Canyon Road.

109
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.625
and there's no fire engines here

110
00:06:44.709 --> 00:06:46.500
for structure protection
or anything.

111
00:06:46.583 --> 00:06:50.125
and the fire is coming down
the mountain right now.

112
00:06:50.208 --> 00:06:52.750
This area has to be
evacuated right now.

113
00:06:52.834 --> 00:06:54.542
I'm not kidding around!

114
00:06:54.625 --> 00:06:56.458
Winds
on the ridgetop probably...

115
00:06:56.542 --> 00:06:58.709
-...it's 40 to 50 miles an hour.

116
00:06:58.792 --> 00:07:00.542
Active long-range spotting.

117
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.750
Where are the fire department?

118
00:07:04.834 --> 00:07:06.000
911 OPERATOR:
They're all there. ma'am.

119
00:07:06.083 --> 00:07:07.583
-They're all there.
- No. they're not!

120
00:07:07.667 --> 00:07:11.041
We're surrounded by fire
and we can't get out.

121
00:07:11.125 --> 00:07:13.834
-We have no help!

122
00:07:13.917 --> 00:07:15.709
My mom's stuck
in the fire down there.

123
00:07:15.792 --> 00:07:18.583
and she can't get out.
She's with my brother.

124
00:07:18.667 --> 00:07:20.417
The tree right above my house.

125
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.917
And there's embers.
Oh my God. it's starting to go.

126
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.959
I'm at home alone.
and I can see the flames

127
00:07:26.041 --> 00:07:27.834
-coming over the next canyon.
-911 OPERATOR: Yes.

128
00:07:27.917 --> 00:07:31.291
And I don't know what
to do. I can hear the crackling.

129
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.792
There was just
fire absolutely everywhere.

130
00:07:34.875 --> 00:07:36.583
It was getting so bad.
I couldn't breathe.

131
00:07:36.667 --> 00:07:39.125
I couldn't see much more
than an arm's length.

132
00:07:39.208 --> 00:07:40.625
and as we were driving out. uh.

133
00:07:40.709 --> 00:07:43.333
the fire was pinching off
and we barely made it out.

134
00:07:43.417 --> 00:07:44.625
Go! Let's go!

135
00:07:44.709 --> 00:07:48.041
And it hopscotched
from canyon to canyon to canyon

136
00:07:48.125 --> 00:07:51.458
and moved. in a matter
of six hours.

137
00:07:51.542 --> 00:07:53.792
what it would probably
take six days

138
00:07:53.875 --> 00:07:56.250
to accomplish on a normal day
without the wind.

139
00:07:56.333 --> 00:07:58.542
Residents north of Foothill.

140
00:07:58.625 --> 00:08:00.125
-evacuate your home.

141
00:08:00.208 --> 00:08:03.291
While all this was taking place.
a new fire started.

142
00:08:03.375 --> 00:08:05.291
A transformer just blew up.

143
00:08:05.375 --> 00:08:06.959
and. uh. it's going pretty good.

144
00:08:07.041 --> 00:08:08.291
Very end of Koenigstein.

145
00:08:08.375 --> 00:08:10.792
there's. uh--
A transformer just blew. and--

146
00:08:10.875 --> 00:08:13.417
and there's a major fire
started up here.

147
00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.000
That new fire
started in Upper Ojai.

148
00:08:17.083 --> 00:08:21.000
We were being hit
on multiple fronts.

149
00:08:21.083 --> 00:08:24.792
As priorities came through
for the Koenigstein Road area.

150
00:08:24.875 --> 00:08:27.208
the fire apparatus
was quickly cut off

151
00:08:27.291 --> 00:08:29.583
from traveling
the Highway 150 corridor.

152
00:08:30.625 --> 00:08:31.750
We had burning power poles.

153
00:08:31.834 --> 00:08:34.667
we had live electrical lines
down across the highway.

154
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.959
And that main thoroughfare
that got companies

155
00:08:37.041 --> 00:08:39.750
up to Upper Ojai quick
was immediately cut off.

156
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:48.750
NOÉMIE:
It was exactly 8:00 p.m.

157
00:08:48.834 --> 00:08:51.500
and I was very. very excited

158
00:08:51.583 --> 00:08:53.583
because for the first time.
I was able

159
00:08:53.667 --> 00:08:56.250
to just put her in bed
at the right moment.

160
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.333
My excitement faded pretty fast

161
00:09:00.417 --> 00:09:02.333
because right after that.

162
00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:06.166
I started to hear
sounds of helicopters.

163
00:09:09.917 --> 00:09:11.917
We put all of the aircraft

164
00:09:12.792 --> 00:09:14.667
up in the Koenigstein Road area.

165
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:18.792
but the water that you drop
is just being taken by the wind.

166
00:09:21.083 --> 00:09:23.166
The aircraft called Operations
on the radio and say.

167
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.250
"It's unsafe for us
to be up in the air.

168
00:09:25.333 --> 00:09:26.500
We're shutting down."

169
00:09:28.125 --> 00:09:29.875
As it was rapidly escalating.

170
00:09:29.959 --> 00:09:31.542
the potential for loss of life

171
00:09:31.625 --> 00:09:34.250
was greater than anything
that I had seen before.

172
00:09:35.125 --> 00:09:37.417
NOÉMIE:
When I went outside the house.

173
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:42.583
I saw this gigantic glow
up in the mountain.

174
00:09:42.667 --> 00:09:47.000
And I decided to check
on the Ojai Twitter.

175
00:09:47.083 --> 00:09:49.667
and I just read.
"There is a fire...

176
00:09:50.333 --> 00:09:51.834
two miles from your house

177
00:09:51.917 --> 00:09:56.000
with 70-miles-per-hour gusts."

178
00:09:56.083 --> 00:10:00.667
I remember telling my husband.
"We gotta go now."

179
00:10:02.041 --> 00:10:06.083
I woke up the baby.
put her in her car seat.

180
00:10:06.166 --> 00:10:08.417
-put her in the car.

181
00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:12.250
NOÉMIE: I run back
inside the house and...

182
00:10:13.834 --> 00:10:17.917
...the baby starts screaming.
and I turn

183
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.917
and I could see
this insane. scary glow...

184
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.083
that was coming right at us.

185
00:10:29.625 --> 00:10:31.917
We drove down
to the nearest hotel

186
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.208
and spent the night
watching the news.

187
00:10:35.291 --> 00:10:37.291
The Thomas Fire
in Ventura County

188
00:10:37.375 --> 00:10:39.375
forced new evacuations
overnight.

189
00:10:39.458 --> 00:10:41.500
It is the largest
of the four fires.

190
00:10:41.583 --> 00:10:43.667
and it's only five percent
contained.

191
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:45.959
Now. winds
are actually carrying the fire

192
00:10:46.041 --> 00:10:47.125
toward Ojai.

193
00:10:47.208 --> 00:10:49.291
We saw a wall of flames
that had to have been

194
00:10:49.375 --> 00:10:51.250
300 feet or higher.

195
00:10:51.333 --> 00:10:53.875
We've been hearing
the sparks and loud booms

196
00:10:53.959 --> 00:10:55.792
from transformers
that have caught fire

197
00:10:55.875 --> 00:10:57.375
and they blasted off.

198
00:11:37.291 --> 00:11:39.792
Uh. have 'em
head toward the city of Ventura

199
00:11:39.875 --> 00:11:41.875
on Highway 126.
It's at the Aquatic Center

200
00:11:41.959 --> 00:11:44.291
is what we're being told
for the nighttime spot.

201
00:11:54.458 --> 00:11:56.625
I hear the screaming.

202
00:11:56.709 --> 00:11:58.667
"You need to evacuate!
You need to evacuate!

203
00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:59.917
Search and rescue."

204
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.834
He says. "Sweetheart.

205
00:12:01.917 --> 00:12:03.709
the fire is right there
in Bill's yard.

206
00:12:03.792 --> 00:12:05.125
You have to get out of here."

207
00:12:05.208 --> 00:12:07.959
I see the fire in that canyon.

208
00:12:08.041 --> 00:12:10.166
and I don't wanna leave

209
00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:13.208
because I spended a lot of time
to build my house.

210
00:12:13.291 --> 00:12:16.417
And then all of a sudden.
the wall of flame came over.

211
00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:17.917
Then I looked to the left.

212
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.583
and the flames are coming
up the valley.

213
00:12:19.667 --> 00:12:21.125
Then I looked behind me.

214
00:12:21.208 --> 00:12:22.834
and the fire
was coming behind me.

215
00:12:22.917 --> 00:12:24.375
so virtually surrounded.

216
00:12:24.458 --> 00:12:27.291
When I got to the perimeter
of my property.

217
00:12:27.375 --> 00:12:29.875
I could see
that my neighbor's house...

218
00:12:29.959 --> 00:12:31.583
was completely on fire.

219
00:12:31.667 --> 00:12:34.125
I've seen a lot of fires
in the Australian Outback

220
00:12:34.208 --> 00:12:37.417
and in surrounding suburbs
and around the cities.

221
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.667
but I'd never seen it move
this fast.

222
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.875
We're alive. And. uh...

223
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.166
You go on.

224
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.583
Now we have five fire fronts.

225
00:13:09.667 --> 00:13:11.417
We're still dealing
with Santa Paula.

226
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.417
Fillmore. Upper Ojai.

227
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.625
and now the topography drives
this dry weather

228
00:13:15.709 --> 00:13:17.166
and the wind is even stronger.

229
00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.333
and now it starts moving
around Ojai.

230
00:13:19.417 --> 00:13:23.917
and you're getting an idea now
how this is a monster.

231
00:13:27.709 --> 00:13:30.500
NOÉMIE: We were
in the hotel room in shock.

232
00:13:30.583 --> 00:13:31.792
And in the morning.

233
00:13:31.875 --> 00:13:33.417
when my husband went
to get coffee.

234
00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.625
one of our neighbor
in the lobby said

235
00:13:35.709 --> 00:13:38.375
that he personally witnessed
our house

236
00:13:38.458 --> 00:13:40.208
being attacked by flames.

237
00:13:41.959 --> 00:13:44.792
As this news try to sink in.

238
00:13:44.875 --> 00:13:48.750
someone knocked crazy
and just yelled.

239
00:13:48.834 --> 00:13:51.709
"Get out. get out.
evacuation again."

240
00:13:54.792 --> 00:13:57.375
I mean. everything is on fire.

241
00:13:58.083 --> 00:14:00.750
I was extremely scared...

242
00:14:00.834 --> 00:14:03.667
because we were new to the area.

243
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:07.667
I just didn't know
what was the best escape plan.

244
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:11.166
Oh. my God.
are we driving right at it?

245
00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:14.333
It's okay.
this is turning away from it.

246
00:14:14.417 --> 00:14:15.834
NOÉMIE: No. I don't think so.

247
00:14:15.917 --> 00:14:18.041
These people are just looking.

248
00:14:19.333 --> 00:14:21.583
NOÉMIE: Oh. my God.

249
00:14:31.542 --> 00:14:33.625
We escaped north
through the mountains

250
00:14:33.709 --> 00:14:34.834
towards Santa Barbara.

251
00:14:34.917 --> 00:14:37.542
The fire got to our house
so fast the night before

252
00:14:37.625 --> 00:14:39.709
that we didn't have time
to pack anything.

253
00:14:39.792 --> 00:14:41.250
We just ran out.

254
00:14:41.333 --> 00:14:44.291
and. uh. we didn't know
what was gonna happen next.

255
00:14:45.792 --> 00:14:47.208
Going into the weekend.

256
00:14:47.291 --> 00:14:50.500
red flag warnings are saturating
much of the state.

257
00:14:50.583 --> 00:14:52.125
The Thomas Fire is larger

258
00:14:52.208 --> 00:14:55.125
than New York City
and Boston combined.

259
00:14:56.375 --> 00:14:57.542
As we're listening

260
00:14:57.625 --> 00:14:59.875
to how it's just raging
towards us

261
00:14:59.959 --> 00:15:02.208
down on the west end
of the Ojai Valley.

262
00:15:02.291 --> 00:15:04.000
we started thinking
about the things

263
00:15:04.083 --> 00:15:06.500
that we needed to gather.

264
00:15:07.458 --> 00:15:08.875
We had seven cats.

265
00:15:08.959 --> 00:15:12.333
three dogs. two ratties.
and two birds

266
00:15:12.417 --> 00:15:14.000
to travel with five of us.

267
00:15:14.083 --> 00:15:17.458
We took two vehicles.
and we drove to Santa Barbara.

268
00:15:20.041 --> 00:15:21.625
As of Saturday afternoon.

269
00:15:21.709 --> 00:15:24.750
8.400 firefighters
working on this fire.

270
00:15:24.834 --> 00:15:27.709
Already we've seen
1.000 structures destroyed.

271
00:15:27.792 --> 00:15:30.333
18.000 structures threatened.

272
00:15:31.667 --> 00:15:35.041
NOÉMIE:

273
00:15:52.792 --> 00:15:54.917
NOÉMIE:
On our wedding anniversary.

274
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.792
we decided to drive back.

275
00:15:56.875 --> 00:15:59.417
It was... apocalyptic.

276
00:16:01.458 --> 00:16:04.583
When we finally turn
into our street.

277
00:16:04.667 --> 00:16:07.000
um. I was shocked.

278
00:16:08.375 --> 00:16:12.667
All those houses. so many.
they were just gone.

279
00:16:17.125 --> 00:16:19.792
When we finally arrived
to our house.

280
00:16:19.875 --> 00:16:21.458
I couldn't believe it.

281
00:16:21.542 --> 00:16:24.834
After thinking
that your house is gone.

282
00:16:24.917 --> 00:16:27.792
this feeling of knowing
that it's still there

283
00:16:27.875 --> 00:16:31.500
is just amazing.
but at the same time.

284
00:16:31.583 --> 00:16:35.917
I just felt so sorry
for all my neighbors.

285
00:16:45.041 --> 00:16:47.333
We got really. really lucky.

286
00:16:47.417 --> 00:16:49.959
Because our house
is the last house

287
00:16:50.041 --> 00:16:51.583
just before the national forest.

288
00:16:51.667 --> 00:16:53.750
the last fire hydrant
on the street

289
00:16:53.834 --> 00:16:57.041
is actually right here.
which made it an ideal place

290
00:16:57.125 --> 00:16:59.291
for the firefighters
to battle the blaze.

291
00:16:59.375 --> 00:17:03.291
They were literally firing
their hoses over the house

292
00:17:03.375 --> 00:17:06.458
as the fire
blew over here.

293
00:17:08.125 --> 00:17:11.709
NOÉMIE: Some of my neighbors
just were not that lucky.

294
00:17:12.959 --> 00:17:15.583
The people of
the Upper Ojai suffered greatly.

295
00:17:15.667 --> 00:17:18.583
due. in part.
to the second start

296
00:17:18.667 --> 00:17:20.458
up in the Koenigstein area.

297
00:17:20.542 --> 00:17:21.750
It started right here.

298
00:17:21.834 --> 00:17:23.583
I remember coming up here.
and we were already evacuate--

299
00:17:23.667 --> 00:17:26.083
trying to evacuate. uh.
some of these residents up here.

300
00:17:26.166 --> 00:17:27.917
and we looked at it.
we go. "Wow.

301
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.041
We know where it's going."

302
00:17:29.125 --> 00:17:30.583
It's going right toward
your house. basically.

303
00:17:30.667 --> 00:17:31.959
and everyone else's house
down there.

304
00:17:32.041 --> 00:17:33.500
So the whole team is en route.

305
00:17:33.583 --> 00:17:35.208
Mark Scantlin.
we went to school together.

306
00:17:35.291 --> 00:17:36.792
Oh. gosh.
Mark. yes. How are you?

307
00:17:36.875 --> 00:17:38.125
I'm doing all right. John.

308
00:17:38.208 --> 00:17:39.709
-Were you
up here that night?
-Yeah.

309
00:17:39.792 --> 00:17:42.041
-How'd it go for you?
-Oh. I lost everything.

310
00:17:42.125 --> 00:17:43.375
-Oh. man.

311
00:17:43.458 --> 00:17:44.875
-Everything. House--
-Yeah.

312
00:17:44.959 --> 00:17:47.917
House. garage. barns. cars.

313
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.542
-Yeah.
-Looked like a tornado
after it went by.

314
00:17:50.625 --> 00:17:52.166
I hope the future's bright.

315
00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:53.375
-We're moving.
-Are ya?

316
00:17:53.458 --> 00:17:55.250
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Out of the area. or what?

317
00:17:55.333 --> 00:17:56.625
Yeah. I'm done.

318
00:18:01.291 --> 00:18:05.417
The Thomas Fire
currently is at 242.000 acres.

319
00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.000
It's been burning for 10 days.

320
00:18:07.083 --> 00:18:09.750
It ran through
to the western edge

321
00:18:09.834 --> 00:18:11.500
of the City of Ventura
in five hours.

322
00:18:13.166 --> 00:18:16.583
We evacuated in this area.
I think the estimate's around

323
00:18:16.667 --> 00:18:19.250
60.000 people
in that five-hour period.

324
00:18:19.333 --> 00:18:21.250
The first fire started
in the creek bed.

325
00:18:21.333 --> 00:18:23.417
Within an hour of that.
we get information

326
00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.125
that we have a second start
on Koenigstein Road.

327
00:18:26.208 --> 00:18:28.208
You couldn't start a fire
in a worse spot.

328
00:18:28.291 --> 00:18:31.417
We were watching it from up
on the other side of the road.

329
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.583
We saw it start.

330
00:18:32.667 --> 00:18:36.000
we saw you guys lined up.
and we saw you guys leave.

331
00:18:36.083 --> 00:18:37.458
and then it came our way.

332
00:18:37.542 --> 00:18:39.750
-We couldn't get out
fast enough.
- Hmm.

333
00:18:39.834 --> 00:18:41.917
Why weren't you fighting
that fire when that--

334
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:42.959
when it just started.

335
00:18:43.041 --> 00:18:44.417
when it was just local.
right there?

336
00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.333
-We have-- Hold on. Wait.
- Another question.

337
00:18:46.417 --> 00:18:48.959
-Let-- let me finish. Hold on.
- You're charging
an extra tax to us.

338
00:18:49.041 --> 00:18:51.959
-So. hey. we have a--
-And you're requiring us
to have hydrants.

339
00:18:52.041 --> 00:18:53.917
but you won't use them?
I don't understand that.

340
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.583
One hose would have
reached my house

341
00:18:56.667 --> 00:18:59.125
and put it out
and saved five more

342
00:18:59.208 --> 00:19:01.709
from burning down on Cesar.
One hose.

343
00:19:01.792 --> 00:19:03.500
Not to downplay
any of the losses.

344
00:19:03.583 --> 00:19:06.375
but to not have more life loss
is pretty remarkable.

345
00:19:06.458 --> 00:19:08.959
And this is the third time
I've been wearing this
this year.

346
00:19:09.041 --> 00:19:10.417
How many homes did you save?

347
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.458
More than we lost.
I'll tell you that.

348
00:19:12.542 --> 00:19:15.333
The numbers that I'm getting
on the property loss

349
00:19:15.417 --> 00:19:19.458
is somewhere around 100.
uh. structures in this area.

350
00:19:19.542 --> 00:19:21.333
Per capita.
that's the highest loss

351
00:19:21.417 --> 00:19:23.208
we've had on a fire. Um...

352
00:19:24.417 --> 00:19:27.083
That's-- that's a tough
discussion to have.

353
00:19:34.917 --> 00:19:38.834
I lost my home
from the Thomas Fire.

354
00:19:38.917 --> 00:19:44.500
And. uh. it take me 13 years
to build my beautiful house.

355
00:19:44.583 --> 00:19:46.291
And I-- my son told me.

356
00:19:46.375 --> 00:19:49.959
"Daddy. could you please
save the house?"

357
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:54.417
And I said.
"Yes. I will save the house."

358
00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:01.041
My daughter
who lives in Santa Paula.

359
00:20:01.125 --> 00:20:05.291
she called me and she says.
"Mom. our house is gone."

360
00:20:07.917 --> 00:20:09.291
And when I saw it...

361
00:20:11.125 --> 00:20:13.125
it was devastating.

362
00:20:14.875 --> 00:20:16.500
I still can't believe it.

363
00:20:18.834 --> 00:20:21.250
E-- Even though
I'm sitting here...

364
00:20:22.125 --> 00:20:23.500
with my back to it.

365
00:20:29.125 --> 00:20:30.333
And my cats...

366
00:20:31.834 --> 00:20:33.083
didn't live.

367
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:43.208
We just
spray-painted some signs

368
00:20:43.291 --> 00:20:45.792
on pieces of plywood
that said. "Fire relief."

369
00:20:45.875 --> 00:20:48.000
And the supplies kept coming in.

370
00:20:49.208 --> 00:20:52.333
That's how the relief station
was born.

371
00:20:56.917 --> 00:21:00.625
Leona Mote says.
"I live right here on this road.

372
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.041
and I've lived there
for 54 years.

373
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.166
And my husband
just died in October.

374
00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:10.750
And when the fire came.
I was panicking.

375
00:21:10.834 --> 00:21:13.375
looking for my cats."

376
00:21:13.458 --> 00:21:16.125
And I say. "Hey. Leona.
do you need any help?"

377
00:21:16.667 --> 00:21:17.750
She says. "Yeah.

378
00:21:17.834 --> 00:21:19.291
One of the things
that was sitting on my dresser

379
00:21:19.375 --> 00:21:22.041
was my husband's size 13
wedding ring."

380
00:21:26.667 --> 00:21:30.291
First thing we find.
size 13 wedding ring.

381
00:21:30.375 --> 00:21:31.709
Swear to God.

382
00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:35.166
The first thing
that the sifters found

383
00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:38.375
was this ring and another ring.

384
00:21:38.458 --> 00:21:41.875
I love the way the neighborhood
has rallied around.

385
00:21:47.709 --> 00:21:50.583
It's called Star Point Ranch.

386
00:21:50.667 --> 00:21:53.250
We're grateful that.
uh. we got this help

387
00:21:53.333 --> 00:21:54.750
to help clean up
a bit of the mess.

388
00:21:54.834 --> 00:21:57.125
'Cause as you can see.
it's quite devastating

389
00:21:57.208 --> 00:22:00.500
to lose a beautiful
1930s wooden home

390
00:22:00.583 --> 00:22:02.208
and all your belongings.

391
00:22:02.291 --> 00:22:04.417
And we saved bugger all.
you know what I mean?

392
00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.458
So nothing. and virtually
the clothes on our back.

393
00:22:06.542 --> 00:22:07.583
basically.

394
00:22:12.458 --> 00:22:14.208
After the fire.

395
00:22:14.291 --> 00:22:16.709
it looked like
we had been through hell.

396
00:22:16.792 --> 00:22:18.917
We couldn't breathe.
and we couldn't drink the water.

397
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.834
and we c--
we had to wear masks.

398
00:22:20.917 --> 00:22:22.125
And it was like.

399
00:22:22.208 --> 00:22:24.917
"Are we gonna be able
to live here?"

400
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.709
NOÉMIE: The air quality
was just so bad

401
00:22:26.792 --> 00:22:30.166
that we just couldn't risk
to bring our baby back

402
00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:31.959
before it got better.

403
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.875
The air quality
and the conditions

404
00:22:34.959 --> 00:22:37.750
in Ojai Valley were untenable
by most people.

405
00:22:37.834 --> 00:22:41.000
There's a lot more going on
than the fire itself.

406
00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:55.208
Oh. don't try to walk. buddy.

407
00:22:59.667 --> 00:23:01.041
So. it just happens to be

408
00:23:01.125 --> 00:23:03.458
that this upper valley
is a place

409
00:23:03.542 --> 00:23:08.417
where the people considered bear
to be their spirit animal.

410
00:23:09.959 --> 00:23:14.750
That poor little bear that--
that survived the dehydration.

411
00:23:14.834 --> 00:23:18.166
it must have suffered
the burning of its feet.

412
00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:20.083
Great resilience.

413
00:23:25.291 --> 00:23:28.542
The power and the spirit
of these animals.

414
00:23:28.625 --> 00:23:30.041
even the smallest little ones.

415
00:23:30.125 --> 00:23:32.208
hummingbird. butterfly.

416
00:23:32.291 --> 00:23:38.709
they all have abilities that.
as human beings. we want.

417
00:23:38.792 --> 00:23:40.792
Oh. it's coming.
it's coming.

418
00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:46.291
And so to see it
suffer that way.

419
00:23:47.583 --> 00:23:49.917
I could just feel his grief

420
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.625
and total sorrow.

421
00:23:54.333 --> 00:23:56.250
Oh. he's thirsty as hell.

422
00:23:56.333 --> 00:23:57.667
And then to think about

423
00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:59.792
how many other animals
perished...

424
00:23:59.875 --> 00:24:01.709
Here. pal.
Little bit more.

425
00:24:01.792 --> 00:24:03.333
One second. one second.

426
00:24:29.542 --> 00:24:33.250
Let's do 1.5 of Telazol
and 1.5 of water.

427
00:24:33.333 --> 00:24:35.208
You can't overdose a bear
on Telazol.

428
00:24:35.291 --> 00:24:36.667
so that's the good thing.

429
00:24:37.625 --> 00:24:39.291
Just don't hit its lung.

430
00:24:39.375 --> 00:24:41.208
No.
I got a front right shoulder.

431
00:24:41.291 --> 00:24:42.917
-You guys ready?
- Yeah.

432
00:24:52.333 --> 00:24:54.458
-Clean hit.
- Good shot.

433
00:24:54.542 --> 00:24:56.458
So.
it was just like the last bear.

434
00:24:56.542 --> 00:24:58.083
The animal had to be immobilized

435
00:24:58.166 --> 00:24:59.750
so it could be assessed
for further injuries

436
00:24:59.834 --> 00:25:01.041
to see if. you know.

437
00:25:01.125 --> 00:25:03.834
rehabilitation is something
that we can do.

438
00:25:03.917 --> 00:25:05.125
What's the weight estimate now?

439
00:25:05.208 --> 00:25:07.166
- Now. about 30.
-Yeah.

440
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:09.333
- It's a he.
-It's a he. yeah.

441
00:25:09.417 --> 00:25:11.417
- Okay.
-All right.

442
00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.333
Can you tell me sort of
about the scale of this event

443
00:25:14.417 --> 00:25:16.500
in terms of its effect
on the wildlife?

444
00:25:16.583 --> 00:25:17.834
It's gonna be significant.

445
00:25:17.917 --> 00:25:19.458
especially of a fire
of this magnitude.

446
00:25:19.542 --> 00:25:22.417
you know. raging through
the Los Padres National Forest

447
00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.500
as well as up
into the urban community.

448
00:25:24.583 --> 00:25:26.083
And anytime you have wildlife.

449
00:25:26.166 --> 00:25:28.208
just like people living at homes
where they're affected.

450
00:25:28.291 --> 00:25:30.625
you're gonna have wildlife
that's impacted.

451
00:25:33.583 --> 00:25:35.166
It was a really devastating time

452
00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:37.625
for the natural world out here.

453
00:25:37.709 --> 00:25:40.667
But it isn't our first time
that we've experienced fire

454
00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:42.458
growing up here in Ojai.

455
00:25:50.875 --> 00:25:53.208
Evacuation is now taking place.

456
00:25:53.291 --> 00:25:55.458
Three quarters of the town
has been wiped out.

457
00:25:55.542 --> 00:25:56.792
Blackened waste.

458
00:25:58.125 --> 00:26:00.625
Entire communities
to be evacuated.

459
00:26:04.458 --> 00:26:08.125
The president today proclaimed
the fires a national disaster.

460
00:26:10.917 --> 00:26:12.875
We can't keep doing
what we've been doing.

461
00:26:12.959 --> 00:26:15.875
And what we've been doing
is not considering.

462
00:26:15.959 --> 00:26:17.917
"Well. this is a fire corridor.

463
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.208
We know that.
We have to rethink things."

464
00:26:21.291 --> 00:26:23.083
You see something
on that side over there?

465
00:26:23.166 --> 00:26:24.083
Yeah.

466
00:26:24.166 --> 00:26:25.875
That means people may not
be able to build

467
00:26:25.959 --> 00:26:29.208
in places they wanted to build.
and if they do build.

468
00:26:29.291 --> 00:26:30.542
they need to recognize

469
00:26:30.625 --> 00:26:33.959
the fire department's not gonna
be able to protect them.

470
00:26:34.041 --> 00:26:37.083
And the fire agencies
in these firestorms

471
00:26:37.166 --> 00:26:40.125
are basically at wits' end.
and all they can do

472
00:26:40.208 --> 00:26:42.834
is try to keep people safe
and get them out of the way.

473
00:26:42.917 --> 00:26:45.542
Okay. sir.
Keep your arms in for me.

474
00:26:45.625 --> 00:26:50.000
Sadly. through lack
of understanding of nature

475
00:26:50.083 --> 00:26:52.750
and understanding
this fire ecology.

476
00:26:52.834 --> 00:26:55.583
we have allowed houses
to be built

477
00:26:55.667 --> 00:26:59.583
further and further into
the urban wildland interface

478
00:26:59.667 --> 00:27:02.083
right on the edge
between the chaparral

479
00:27:02.166 --> 00:27:03.917
-and the urban areas.

480
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.291
The areas that are
very difficult to defend.

481
00:27:12.166 --> 00:27:14.375
JONATHAN "YONNI" SCHWARTZ:
Well. the fire comes and goes.

482
00:27:14.458 --> 00:27:17.250
but for the vegetation
to reestablish itself.

483
00:27:17.333 --> 00:27:19.000
it takes a few years.

484
00:27:20.333 --> 00:27:24.709
Now. concern was
how this burned landscape

485
00:27:24.792 --> 00:27:28.458
is going to respond
to rainstorms.

486
00:27:38.875 --> 00:27:40.417
Equally as scary to the fire

487
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:44.208
is the risk of a mudslide
or some sort of debris flow.

488
00:27:46.709 --> 00:27:48.250
During the 1969 flood.

489
00:27:48.333 --> 00:27:50.667
there was actually a family
living right here

490
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:52.041
that got washed out

491
00:27:52.125 --> 00:27:55.125
by the amount of water
that comes off this hillside.

492
00:27:57.709 --> 00:28:00.667
We were able to move back in
about a month after the fire.

493
00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:03.458
just in time for the biggest
rainstorm in years.

494
00:28:04.542 --> 00:28:06.625
I started digging
some trenches out back

495
00:28:06.709 --> 00:28:08.291
to protect our house.

496
00:28:08.375 --> 00:28:11.083
A cold front
and a squall line with lightning

497
00:28:11.166 --> 00:28:13.959
is developing and moving
into the Los Angeles area.

498
00:28:14.041 --> 00:28:16.834
The National Weather Service
has warned that flash flooding.

499
00:28:16.917 --> 00:28:19.333
debris flow.
and mudslides are possible

500
00:28:19.417 --> 00:28:21.417
in the communities
already devastated

501
00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.917
by the Thomas and La Tuna Fires.

502
00:28:29.959 --> 00:28:32.875
Mandatory evacuation
orders are in place here.

503
00:28:32.959 --> 00:28:36.375
Thirty thousand people
are in these evacuation zones.

504
00:28:36.458 --> 00:28:40.250
Many of these slopes
right above Ojai

505
00:28:40.333 --> 00:28:43.959
have very high probabilities

506
00:28:44.041 --> 00:28:46.417
of producing debris flows.

507
00:28:48.875 --> 00:28:52.625
People have these big boulders
in their backyards.

508
00:28:52.709 --> 00:28:53.834
really like them.

509
00:28:53.917 --> 00:28:56.667
It was great landscaping.
but none of them thought.

510
00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:59.291
"Well. how did these boulders
come here?"

511
00:29:00.458 --> 00:29:02.917
For the second time
in about a month.

512
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.166
search and rescue
was on our street.

513
00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:06.792
evacuating residents.

514
00:29:09.125 --> 00:29:10.542
It happened in the past.

515
00:29:10.625 --> 00:29:12.750
It will happen again
in the future.

516
00:29:12.834 --> 00:29:14.875
That's a basic law of geology.

517
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.250
Developing tonight.
the search is on

518
00:29:18.333 --> 00:29:22.583
for mudslide survivors
in Southern California.

519
00:29:22.667 --> 00:29:26.250
Rescuers are trying to reach
13 people reported missing.

520
00:29:26.333 --> 00:29:28.250
17 have already died.

521
00:29:28.333 --> 00:29:30.542
Authorities say at least
100 homes are destroyed.

522
00:29:30.625 --> 00:29:33.208
-washed away by the wall of mud.
- The staging area

523
00:29:33.291 --> 00:29:34.667
for the urban search
and rescue efforts

524
00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:36.333
-had been set up...
- Live in Montecito

525
00:29:36.417 --> 00:29:40.083
where the streets are absolutely
littered with cars and debris.

526
00:29:40.166 --> 00:29:43.834
I heard the rumble of the rocks
and I looked over at the river.

527
00:29:43.917 --> 00:29:46.500
and the trees are just
coming down.

528
00:29:50.625 --> 00:29:55.625
We were able to crawl out
our window to the roof.

529
00:29:55.709 --> 00:29:58.709
House is wiped out.
Just took everything out.

530
00:29:58.792 --> 00:30:01.667
And then later. we were worried
about our neighbor's house

531
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:04.625
and we went over to see if.
uh. they were okay.

532
00:30:04.709 --> 00:30:07.000
and we heard
a little baby crying

533
00:30:07.083 --> 00:30:10.125
and. uh. dug down.
found a little baby.

534
00:30:10.208 --> 00:30:12.083
I don't know where it came from.

535
00:30:12.166 --> 00:30:16.333
But. uh. we got it out.
got the mud out of its mouth.

536
00:30:18.208 --> 00:30:19.417
I hope that it's okay.

537
00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:20.625
They took it
right to the hospital.

538
00:30:20.709 --> 00:30:23.834
But it was just a baby
four feet down in the mud.

539
00:30:23.917 --> 00:30:26.458
in nowhere.
just under the rocks.

540
00:30:26.542 --> 00:30:27.959
I'm glad we got it.

541
00:30:28.041 --> 00:30:30.333
But who knows
what else is out there.

542
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:39.166
ALEXANDER "TREY" ROBERTSON IV:
Okay. folks. We'll go ahead
and get started.

543
00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:40.583
Thank you for coming.

544
00:30:40.667 --> 00:30:43.083
Collectively.
our group represents

545
00:30:43.166 --> 00:30:46.166
about 455 clients

546
00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:49.250
whose homes were either
completely destroyed or damaged

547
00:30:49.333 --> 00:30:52.750
in the fire
or the resulting debris flow.

548
00:30:52.834 --> 00:30:55.875
Cal Fire investigators
are looking at burn patterns.

549
00:30:55.959 --> 00:30:57.125
how it spread.

550
00:30:57.208 --> 00:30:59.083
and they specifically
are looking

551
00:30:59.166 --> 00:31:03.375
at Southern California Edison's
power lines and poles.

552
00:31:03.458 --> 00:31:05.166
I was sitting in our family room

553
00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:07.667
that has the beautiful view
up to the Topas.

554
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:09.917
and I said. "Oh. my gosh!

555
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.125
I see two flashes.
two fires just started."

556
00:31:13.208 --> 00:31:15.583
And it was the transformers
that had exploded

557
00:31:15.667 --> 00:31:16.834
on Koenigstein.

558
00:31:16.917 --> 00:31:19.041
As soon
as the transformers exploded.

559
00:31:19.125 --> 00:31:20.458
our power went out.

560
00:31:21.542 --> 00:31:23.250
It was about a 50-foot
wall of flame

561
00:31:23.333 --> 00:31:25.291
that actually came up
and hit the house.

562
00:31:25.917 --> 00:31:27.458
It looked like a war zone.

563
00:31:28.959 --> 00:31:31.417
It's amazing to me in that.

564
00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:34.375
in this age of technology.

565
00:31:34.458 --> 00:31:39.625
we're still relying upon
World War II infrastructure

566
00:31:39.709 --> 00:31:41.834
to transmit electricity.

567
00:31:41.917 --> 00:31:43.750
It's-- it's just crazy.

568
00:31:47.041 --> 00:31:49.625
Overall. all the fires in 2017.

569
00:31:49.709 --> 00:31:53.458
you're talking
almost 10.000 structures lost.

570
00:31:53.542 --> 00:31:55.291
If you count
the Montecito mudslide.

571
00:31:55.375 --> 00:31:58.667
you're talking
60 plus fatalities.

572
00:32:00.333 --> 00:32:04.834
I was hoping that event
would create a wake-up call

573
00:32:04.917 --> 00:32:07.500
and force us to ask
the hard questions.

574
00:32:07.583 --> 00:32:10.250
Should the utilities
do something to create

575
00:32:10.333 --> 00:32:13.333
a more resilient system?
Absolutely.

576
00:32:14.333 --> 00:32:16.000
But we have to look
at the big picture.

577
00:32:16.083 --> 00:32:18.750
because what we're really doing
is putting Band-Aids everywhere.

578
00:32:18.834 --> 00:32:21.041
We're not looking
at the disease.

579
00:32:22.125 --> 00:32:24.000
The last drought we had recently

580
00:32:24.083 --> 00:32:27.166
was the worst drought we've had
in a thousand years.

581
00:32:29.083 --> 00:32:30.417
There's probably gonna be towns

582
00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:32.083
in the western side
of the Sierras

583
00:32:32.166 --> 00:32:35.000
that are just gonna become
drought ghost towns.

584
00:32:36.375 --> 00:32:39.667
I knew my neighbors
were not doing great.

585
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:43.709
I knew my neighbors
were uninsured or underinsured.

586
00:32:43.792 --> 00:32:45.959
living in tents.

587
00:32:46.041 --> 00:32:48.583
But there are certain times
where I'm like.

588
00:32:48.667 --> 00:32:51.250
I don't wanna be waking up
at 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning.

589
00:32:51.333 --> 00:32:53.625
looking out the windows when
there's 70-mile-an-hour winds.

590
00:32:53.709 --> 00:32:55.417
thinking my house
is gonna burn down.

591
00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:57.458
That's not normal.

592
00:32:57.542 --> 00:32:59.375
It's sad
because I always thought

593
00:32:59.458 --> 00:33:01.000
I'm gonna live here forever.

594
00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:06.125
I raised my kids here
on this property.

595
00:33:06.208 --> 00:33:09.667
And this is my new home.

596
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:13.000
I got myself
two four-month-old kittens.

597
00:33:13.083 --> 00:33:15.583
And they are filling my house
with love.

598
00:33:15.667 --> 00:33:18.709
This is my sanctuary.

599
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.458
NOÉMIE: You hear a lot
of people that say

600
00:33:25.542 --> 00:33:27.458
that we shouldn't be
living here.

601
00:33:27.542 --> 00:33:29.542
but I'm looking
all around the news

602
00:33:29.625 --> 00:33:33.375
and seeing all of those
big natural catastrophes

603
00:33:33.458 --> 00:33:35.583
happening everywhere.
and I'm just wondering.

604
00:33:35.667 --> 00:33:37.208
"Where am I safe
to be living in?"

605
00:33:37.291 --> 00:33:39.750
Tonight. rivers
are rising to record levels.

606
00:33:39.834 --> 00:33:43.208
threatening homes and businesses
in Arkansas. Oklahoma.

607
00:33:43.291 --> 00:33:44.750
Kansas. and Missouri.

608
00:33:44.834 --> 00:33:47.166
Hurricane Michael closing in
on the Florida Panhandle.

609
00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:49.375
It could be the strongest storm
ever to hit that area.

610
00:33:49.458 --> 00:33:51.125
The Mendocino Complex Fire

611
00:33:51.208 --> 00:33:53.625
is now the largest wildfire
in state history.

612
00:33:53.709 --> 00:33:55.750
Sixty-six
million Americans

613
00:33:55.834 --> 00:33:57.333
are bracing for impact.

614
00:33:57.417 --> 00:33:59.709
In the past week.
at least 15 people

615
00:33:59.792 --> 00:34:01.500
have been killed by tornadoes
and flooding.

616
00:34:01.583 --> 00:34:04.041
There are more
severe storms in the forecast

617
00:34:04.125 --> 00:34:05.667
for later on this week.

618
00:34:16.041 --> 00:34:17.750
All burned in here.

619
00:34:17.834 --> 00:34:19.458
This high up.

620
00:34:23.709 --> 00:34:24.875
When we look back

621
00:34:24.959 --> 00:34:27.709
at how the Native people
survived here.

622
00:34:27.792 --> 00:34:31.667
their connection and their
conversation with nature

623
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:33.166
was supreme.

624
00:34:34.625 --> 00:34:37.834
We can learn a lot
from the natural world.

625
00:34:41.959 --> 00:34:44.208
Plants have
tremendous intelligence.

626
00:34:44.291 --> 00:34:47.500
the way they've adapted
to this fire climate.

627
00:34:47.583 --> 00:34:50.166
We can see corollaries
for our lives.

628
00:34:51.792 --> 00:34:54.583
And I know there's a mystique
about Ojai.

629
00:34:54.667 --> 00:34:57.542
uh. being a "spiritual center"
and stuff like that.

630
00:34:57.625 --> 00:35:00.375
And. uh. I think that's--
I think it's in the mountains.

631
00:35:00.458 --> 00:35:03.250
I think if you get up
to some of these amazing.

632
00:35:03.333 --> 00:35:05.375
beautiful places up there.

633
00:35:05.458 --> 00:35:08.792
you can have a spiritual
experience in nature.

634
00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:12.667
Oh. my God.

635
00:35:19.583 --> 00:35:21.000
Made it to the top.

636
00:35:22.041 --> 00:35:23.959
Really. really spectacular.

637
00:35:56.709 --> 00:35:58.458
NOÉMIE:
You know. I'm still traumatized.

638
00:35:58.542 --> 00:36:00.709
You don't want nobody
to just feel

639
00:36:00.792 --> 00:36:02.333
what we felt that night.

640
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:06.458
Every time I hear
the helicopters.

641
00:36:06.542 --> 00:36:09.208
every time the wind picks up.

642
00:36:09.291 --> 00:36:12.542
I have this scared feeling
inside me.

643
00:36:12.625 --> 00:36:14.667
If we wanna continue
living here.

644
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:16.834
that's what we will have
to deal

645
00:36:16.917 --> 00:36:19.041
for the rest of our time here.

646
00:36:19.125 --> 00:36:21.583
And I don't know
if I'm just ready for that.

647
00:36:22.917 --> 00:36:26.333
Offshore winds
begin. really. by tomorrow.

648
00:36:26.417 --> 00:36:29.458
Extreme fire danger
for Southern California.

649
00:36:30.667 --> 00:36:32.542
After the Thomas Fire.

650
00:36:32.625 --> 00:36:34.250
after Casitas Fire.

651
00:36:34.333 --> 00:36:38.792
another fire was right here
where I live right now.

652
00:36:42.333 --> 00:36:44.417
My daughter see me sometimes.

653
00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:47.792
that I went out of the house
and look in the stars.

654
00:36:47.875 --> 00:36:49.041
and I say.

655
00:36:51.166 --> 00:36:52.792
"What's going on?" You know?

656
00:36:54.458 --> 00:36:58.291
A 150-acre
brush fire broke out here

657
00:36:58.375 --> 00:37:01.083
at approximately
6:15 this afternoon.

658
00:37:01.166 --> 00:37:03.583
My phone starts going crazy
and I look up.

659
00:37:03.667 --> 00:37:04.875
and what do you know?

660
00:37:04.959 --> 00:37:08.500
There's another fire.
And that's one ridge away.

661
00:37:08.583 --> 00:37:10.959
Monsters come
in different forms.

662
00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:17.125
Halloween Night. 2019.

663
00:37:17.208 --> 00:37:19.709
there's a fire in Santa Paula.

664
00:37:19.792 --> 00:37:23.000
We can see it here
from Sulphur Mountain Ridge.

665
00:37:23.083 --> 00:37:25.750
And it begins again.

666
00:38:53.333 --> 00:38:54.709
Okay. That's it.
