- Thank you. thank you all
so much for being here.

115
00:04:13.475 --> 00:04:18.040
I know we do this regularly.
but 60 is special. so uh.

116
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.265
(group chuckles)

117
00:04:19.265 --> 00:04:20.483
although at some point you're gonna stop

118
00:04:20.483 --> 00:04:21.869
saying the number. you know.

119
00:04:21.869 --> 00:04:24.030
(group laughing)

120
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.332
You know. we do this
regularly and I'm glad we do.

121
00:04:26.332 --> 00:04:29.984
and we're gonna continue to
do it as long as I'm alive.

122
00:04:29.984 --> 00:04:31.992
And then again. I hope that
you guys will continue it

123
00:04:31.992 --> 00:04:35.134
long after I'm gone. because.
- Absolutely.

124
00:04:35.134 --> 00:04:37.664
without. without this we wouldn't have

125
00:04:37.664 --> 00:04:40.456
what we created and what we do have.

126
00:04:40.456 --> 00:04:43.681
We've created a terrific. terrific empire

127
00:04:43.681 --> 00:04:46.293
for our whole family.
for our kids. your kids.

128
00:04:46.293 --> 00:04:50.921
And no one's gonna have to
struggle or worry at all.

129
00:04:50.921 --> 00:04:54.456
And. you know. there are
families out there that.

130
00:04:54.456 --> 00:04:56.769
and other divisions. who are battling

131
00:04:56.769 --> 00:04:59.943
and they want a piece of
all of what we've got.

132
00:04:59.943 --> 00:05:02.625
Fortunately. you know. the
family I'm talking about.

133
00:05:02.625 --> 00:05:05.480
we've got their support. and
they're a damn good family.

134
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.042
And the reason why they're damn good

135
00:05:07.042 --> 00:05:10.619
is because they run
their family like we do.

136
00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:12.395
We stay in the shadows.

137
00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:14.674
We stay. we don't. we're invisible.

138
00:05:14.674 --> 00:05:16.220
No one knows who the hell we are.

139
00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.425
and we like it like that.

140
00:05:17.425 --> 00:05:19.518
Let the other guys. the blowhearts.

141
00:05:19.518 --> 00:05:22.085
let them run around and strut their stuff.

142
00:05:22.085 --> 00:05:23.021
We don't do that.

143
00:05:23.021 --> 00:05:24.240
That's not what we're about.

144
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.636
- [Woman] No. not that it's so uncommon.

145
00:05:25.636 --> 00:05:27.080
- Absolutely.

146
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.947
And we're gonna continue to do what we do.

147
00:05:30.947 --> 00:05:33.361
and one day this will all be yours.

148
00:05:33.361 --> 00:05:36.314
You all. you're all privy to
what we've grown. what we do.

149
00:05:36.314 --> 00:05:37.460
We'll continue to rise.

150
00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.876
we'll continue to build.
and we'll continue

151
00:05:39.876 --> 00:05:43.433
to protect the foundation
of what we've built.

152
00:05:43.433 --> 00:05:44.536
And we've come a long way.

153
00:05:44.536 --> 00:05:46.250
and we've got even more to keep going.

154
00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.862
I expect all of you to be right there

155
00:05:47.862 --> 00:05:50.052
by my side. as always.

156
00:05:50.052 --> 00:05:50.930
- [Man] Without a doubt.

157
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:51.891
- And. uh-

158
00:05:51.891 --> 00:05:53.204

(lilting waltz music)

165
00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:30.066
- Papa (speaks Italian).

166

(foreboding music)
(lilting waltz music)

167

(man speaking Italian)

172
00:07:25.346 --> 00:07:28.161
- What's going on in America?

173
00:07:28.161 --> 00:07:31.411
(man speaking Italian)

174
00:07:37.711 --> 00:07:39.211
- This is no good.

175
00:07:42.782 --> 00:07:44.032
Nobody listens.

176
00:07:44.874 --> 00:07:46.580
This is the second time
I've been telling you.

177
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.493
we can't have this.

178
00:07:48.493 --> 00:07:50.252
That fuckin' Joe in America.

179
00:07:50.252 --> 00:07:53.561
they don't understand. they don't listen.

180
00:07:53.561 --> 00:07:58.361
This is no good (exhales loudly).

181
00:07:58.361 --> 00:08:00.563
All I should do is get Jocko.

182
00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:02.703
Tell him to go to America.

183
00:08:02.703 --> 00:08:04.381
and we gotta take care of this problem.

184
00:08:04.381 --> 00:08:06.702
We're gonna take care of this right away.

185
00:08:06.702 --> 00:08:08.285
And. you know what?

186
00:08:10.979 --> 00:08:12.588
I'm gonna go.

187
00:08:12.588 --> 00:08:13.605
Get my plane ready.

188
00:08:13.605 --> 00:08:15.630
I'm going to go to America.

189
00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.256
I'm gonna take care of this problem.

190
00:08:17.256 --> 00:08:19.506
This is no good. all right?

191
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.933
(choir singing in foreign language)

192
00:08:43.604 --> 00:08:44.517
- [Man] I gotta search ya.

193
00:08:44.517 --> 00:08:45.350
- You don't gotta search me.

194
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:46.988
I got more respect than
that. and he's good. too.

195
00:08:46.988 --> 00:08:48.905
- All right. follow me.

196
00:08:52.242 --> 00:08:55.159
(woman chattering)

197
00:09:09.026 --> 00:09:12.445
(people chattering)

198
00:09:12.445 --> 00:09:15.362
- [Vincenzo] How ya doin'. Giacomo?

199
00:09:16.366 --> 00:09:18.533
Show him a little respect.

200
00:09:24.645 --> 00:09:25.812
- You know me?

201
00:09:27.259 --> 00:09:29.434
You seen me before.

202
00:09:29.434 --> 00:09:30.692
- [Vincenzo] This is one of my guys

203
00:09:30.692 --> 00:09:32.163
for the Talicani family.

204
00:09:32.163 --> 00:09:33.219
He was there that night.

205
00:09:33.219 --> 00:09:35.136
He took one in the leg.

206
00:09:37.963 --> 00:09:38.796
Tell him.

207
00:09:40.583 --> 00:09:43.648
- I was down there with a few
(speaks Italian) in the club.

208
00:09:43.648 --> 00:09:45.415
Next thing I know. it's
14 (speaks Italian).

209
00:09:45.415 --> 00:09:47.880
They run in. and they start
shooting up the place.

210
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.157
One of them hits me.
I got hit in the knee.

211
00:09:50.157 --> 00:09:52.519
The other one hits me
over the head with a bat.

212
00:09:52.519 --> 00:09:54.783
I don't remember much after that.

213
00:09:54.783 --> 00:09:57.677
But I'm telling ya. it's
the family from Harlem.

214
00:09:57.677 --> 00:10:00.417
They came and there's 23 people dead.

215
00:10:00.417 --> 00:10:01.917
They seen these guys around before.

216
00:10:01.917 --> 00:10:04.063
I heard about 'em doing things.

217
00:10:04.063 --> 00:10:06.337
(foreboding music)

218
00:10:06.337 --> 00:10:08.217
- [Giacomo] That's the whole story. huh?

219
00:10:08.217 --> 00:10:09.599
- That's it.

220
00:10:09.599 --> 00:10:10.873
- That's all you could remember?

221
00:10:10.873 --> 00:10:11.873
- That's it.

222
00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.541
I'm willing to do anything
to take these guys down.

223
00:10:15.541 --> 00:10:17.007
Anything you want.

224
00:10:17.007 --> 00:10:19.556
It's the kind of guy I am.

225
00:10:19.556 --> 00:10:21.292
- You're not doing nothing.

226
00:10:21.292 --> 00:10:24.542
You keep yourself quiet. you be silent.

227
00:10:26.116 --> 00:10:27.616
You don't know me.

228
00:10:28.587 --> 00:10:30.920
You've never seen me before.

229
00:10:31.823 --> 00:10:33.490
- [Vito] Understood.

230
00:10:34.931 --> 00:10:37.171
- Okay. so now you tell me.

231
00:10:37.171 --> 00:10:38.664
- Okay.

232
00:10:38.664 --> 00:10:41.339
I'm doing 35 million a month.

233
00:10:41.339 --> 00:10:45.412
Just like my old man did.
which you know my old man.

234
00:10:45.412 --> 00:10:47.588
I both want them to
go. they gotta go away.

235
00:10:47.588 --> 00:10:48.754
They gotta go.

236
00:10:48.754 --> 00:10:50.087
Carmine and Joe.

237
00:10:51.135 --> 00:10:52.927
This all started when he slapped

238
00:10:52.927 --> 00:10:55.609
some guy around from fuckin' Chinatown.

239
00:10:55.609 --> 00:10:57.280
That's when this all started.

240
00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.197
Joe got a big chip on his shoulder.

241
00:11:01.798 --> 00:11:04.468
We weren't involved in that.

242
00:11:04.468 --> 00:11:06.420
We got our business going.

243
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.753
We're making big money for the family.

244
00:11:08.753 --> 00:11:10.029
This is what I'm telling you.

245
00:11:10.029 --> 00:11:12.369
He's getting involved in too many things.

246
00:11:12.369 --> 00:11:16.039
him and Carmine. and
Carmine goes along with it.

247
00:11:16.039 --> 00:11:18.551
They're laughing at you. okay?

248
00:11:18.551 --> 00:11:19.747
You want me to tell you why?

249
00:11:19.747 --> 00:11:21.569
With this computer shit and the tech.

250
00:11:21.569 --> 00:11:25.109
they think the old school
guys are gone. we're nothing.

251
00:11:25.109 --> 00:11:25.942
You know what they call.

252
00:11:25.942 --> 00:11:27.130
you know what I heard one of 'em say?

253
00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:28.660
That we were paper gangsters.

254
00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:32.543
Why don't you bring that back to Italy?

255
00:11:32.543 --> 00:11:34.102
- Other families. other people.

256
00:11:34.102 --> 00:11:38.019
other cultures coming
in. doing our dirty work.

257
00:11:39.068 --> 00:11:41.795
doing any kind of work.

258
00:11:41.795 --> 00:11:43.327
This is what the family's about.

259
00:11:43.327 --> 00:11:45.660
This is what we call family.

260
00:11:46.751 --> 00:11:48.895
You talk about technology. being updated.

261
00:11:48.895 --> 00:11:51.228
This is. this is unheard of.

262
00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:57.911
- Listen. he used these people before.

263
00:11:57.911 --> 00:11:59.363
He uses these guys from ya.

264
00:11:59.363 --> 00:12:02.857
Listen. I'm telling you I
wouldn't be at this table

265
00:12:02.857 --> 00:12:04.489
if this wasn't very important.

266
00:12:04.489 --> 00:12:06.606
- This is not the way your
father handled business.

267
00:12:06.606 --> 00:12:08.523
- They both have to go.

268
00:12:09.379 --> 00:12:12.361
- [Giacomo] So. uh. let
me ask you a question.

269
00:12:12.361 --> 00:12:14.512
Where have you been?

270
00:12:14.512 --> 00:12:16.386
- I've been laying low.

271
00:12:16.386 --> 00:12:18.122
- You've been laying low.
- I been laying low.

272
00:12:18.122 --> 00:12:19.400
- Then who put the hit on Joe?

273
00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.794
- I did.

274
00:12:20.794 --> 00:12:22.080
- You did.

275
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.367
You laid low when you put a hit on Joe.

276
00:12:25.367 --> 00:12:26.200
So why?

277
00:12:28.031 --> 00:12:30.115
- Because he got an outside family

278
00:12:30.115 --> 00:12:31.865
to do his dirty work.

279
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:37.432
(speaks Italian) from Harlem.

280
00:12:37.432 --> 00:12:39.156
- [Giacomo] And you think this is good?

281
00:12:39.156 --> 00:12:40.310
- Are you telling me that woulda flew

282
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:42.365
back then with my dad?

283
00:12:42.365 --> 00:12:46.290
He gets somebody from the
outside family to come in?

284
00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:50.161
I sat down with three families
and we discussed this.

285
00:12:50.161 --> 00:12:52.038
The guy's out of fuckin' control.

286
00:12:52.038 --> 00:12:54.121
He's just out of control.

287
00:12:55.145 --> 00:12:56.959
We all agreed on it.

288
00:12:56.959 --> 00:12:58.158
I put the hit on him.

289
00:12:58.158 --> 00:12:59.241
I'm the boss.

290
00:13:00.478 --> 00:13:02.677
- Now that I'm here.

291
00:13:02.677 --> 00:13:06.185
there's gonna be big changes. okay?

292
00:13:06.185 --> 00:13:08.063
- Yes. yes. that's why I'm here.

293
00:13:08.063 --> 00:13:10.313
- This is not kindergarten.

294
00:13:12.108 --> 00:13:14.129
There's a way to do things.

295
00:13:14.129 --> 00:13:16.914
and this is not the way we do things.

296
00:13:16.914 --> 00:13:17.815
You understand?

297
00:13:17.815 --> 00:13:19.954
- Yes I do. but he's a sneaky little fuck.

298
00:13:19.954 --> 00:13:20.787
- All right.

299
00:13:20.787 --> 00:13:21.620
- He's a sneaky little fuck

300
00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:22.878
- All right.
with his computer.

301
00:13:22.878 --> 00:13:24.781
the technology. all this.

302
00:13:24.781 --> 00:13:25.755
they both gotta go.

303
00:13:25.755 --> 00:13:28.291
Carmine and him gotta go.

304
00:13:28.291 --> 00:13:29.310
That's all I'm askin'.

305
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:30.477
They gotta go.

306
00:13:31.857 --> 00:13:33.830
- Well. you wait.

307
00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:36.169
- Understood.
- You don't push.

308
00:13:36.169 --> 00:13:37.969
You don't move quick.

309
00:13:37.969 --> 00:13:39.814
That's why we're here. we're talking.

310
00:13:39.814 --> 00:13:40.647
- Understood.

311
00:13:40.647 --> 00:13:43.449
- And when you talk about
things. things work out.

312
00:13:43.449 --> 00:13:44.282
You understand?

313
00:13:44.282 --> 00:13:46.183
- I under. I understand you 100%.

314
00:13:46.183 --> 00:13:47.285
- You wanna keep Brooklyn?

315
00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:48.308
- Yes. I do.

316
00:13:48.308 --> 00:13:50.949
And another thing. if you
think he respects you.

317
00:13:50.949 --> 00:13:52.919
he didn't tell you a fucking thing.

318
00:13:52.919 --> 00:13:55.808
I told you everything from the heart.

319
00:13:55.808 --> 00:13:57.748
This is somebody you trust in a family?

320
00:13:57.748 --> 00:14:02.049
This is somebody you want
to stand for the family?

321
00:14:02.049 --> 00:14:03.089
I don't think so.

322
00:14:03.089 --> 00:14:06.587
I don't think this is what you guys want.

323
00:14:06.587 --> 00:14:09.645
- Okay. the Don is gonna
come down from Sicily.

324
00:14:09.645 --> 00:14:12.980
and there's gonna be big changes.

325
00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:14.983
And it's gonna be good for you.

326
00:14:14.983 --> 00:14:16.566
Stay low. we. okay?

327
00:14:19.096 --> 00:14:20.528
Especially this guy.

328
00:14:20.528 --> 00:14:21.460
- [Vincenzo] Understood.

329
00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.960
- Okay. we'll get back to you.

330
00:14:25.359 --> 00:14:30.019
And you. you're gonna
point out everybody. okay?

331
00:14:30.019 --> 00:14:33.769
I wanna know exactly
who they are. all right?

332
00:14:34.651 --> 00:14:35.610
You got it?

333
00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:37.193
- We could do that.

334
00:14:39.156 --> 00:14:41.989
- Okay. boys. the meeting is over.

335
00:14:44.037 --> 00:14:44.870
- [Vincenzo] Thanks. Giacomo.

336
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:47.203
- All right.
- Appreciate it.

337
00:14:51.437 --> 00:14:54.104
(ominous music)

338
00:15:00.886 --> 00:15:03.719
(car door clicks)

339
00:15:04.948 --> 00:15:06.831
- These guys. they come in here.

340
00:15:06.831 --> 00:15:08.299
they shot up the place.

341
00:15:08.299 --> 00:15:09.132
I feel like going in and knocking

342
00:15:09.132 --> 00:15:11.038
their fuckin' teeth down their throat.

343
00:15:11.038 --> 00:15:14.697
- Hey. look. take it fuckin' easy here.

344
00:15:14.697 --> 00:15:17.834
This is not the way we do things here.

345
00:15:17.834 --> 00:15:20.267
I just wanna know what went down.

346
00:15:20.267 --> 00:15:23.017
who they were. and what you know.

347
00:15:24.273 --> 00:15:26.595
- Listen. I was out here. I seen the guys.

348
00:15:26.595 --> 00:15:28.174
There was at least several of 'em.

349
00:15:28.174 --> 00:15:29.012
Right. they're over here.

350
00:15:29.012 --> 00:15:30.801
runnin' their mouth. breakin' balls.

351
00:15:30.801 --> 00:15:32.555
They start shooting up the place.

352
00:15:32.555 --> 00:15:33.448
I can't take this. man.

353
00:15:33.448 --> 00:15:34.281
I'm gonna go in there
and knock their teeth

354
00:15:34.281 --> 00:15:36.448
down their throat.
- No. no. no. no. no. no. no.

355
00:15:36.448 --> 00:15:38.487
I'm gonna take care of it.

356
00:15:38.487 --> 00:15:40.244
You understand?

357
00:15:40.244 --> 00:15:41.661
- Yeah. I gotcha.

358
00:15:44.138 --> 00:15:47.721
- And look at me when
you're talking to me.

359
00:15:50.906 --> 00:15:53.323
I run the show here. not you.

360
00:15:56.386 --> 00:15:58.925
Now you go and you keep yourself clean

361
00:15:58.925 --> 00:16:01.273
until I see you again.

362
00:16:01.273 --> 00:16:03.563
You watch yourself and watch your mouth.

363
00:16:03.563 --> 00:16:04.646
- Understood.

364
00:16:07.411 --> 00:16:10.411
(upbeat jazz music)

365

You guys are really stressing me out.

367
00:16:24.879 --> 00:16:28.181
You have a very simple.
very simple perimeter.

368
00:16:28.181 --> 00:16:30.904
135th. 137th. all right?

369
00:16:30.904 --> 00:16:32.152
Come on now. Seattle. man.

Let's go. let's go.

371
00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.190
Chop. chop. man.

372
00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:37.415
You guys are making me look
like a jackass right now.

373
00:16:37.415 --> 00:16:38.594
Let's go. let's get outta here.

374
00:16:38.594 --> 00:16:39.609
Let's get those corners. man.

375
00:16:39.609 --> 00:16:40.694
Let's make it happen.

376
00:16:40.694 --> 00:16:42.017
Come on now. come on.

377
00:16:42.017 --> 00:16:43.072
Tell your story walking. man.

378
00:16:43.072 --> 00:16:44.739
- Sorry.
- Let's go.

379
00:16:55.572 --> 00:16:57.685
(fist thudding)

380
00:16:57.685 --> 00:17:00.082
- What's up. boss?
- I'm tired of it. man.

381
00:17:00.082 --> 00:17:02.061
We've been together all this time.

382
00:17:02.061 --> 00:17:04.541
and. you know. I'm tired. man.

383
00:17:04.541 --> 00:17:06.766
So we've been in this
game. what. a long time.

384
00:17:06.766 --> 00:17:08.480
what. 25. 30 years?

385
00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.675
Something like that.
- Yeah. it's been a long time.

386
00:17:09.675 --> 00:17:11.454
- It's been a long time.
- Long time.

387
00:17:11.454 --> 00:17:13.090
- I don't know how much
longer I can do this.

388
00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:15.184
I'm just tired. man.

389
00:17:15.184 --> 00:17:18.570
I mean. I was thinking
about putting my sword down.

390
00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:20.760
handing my shield over to you.

391
00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.973
I don't think I can do this anymore.

392
00:17:22.973 --> 00:17:24.848
Are you ready for some
more responsibility?

393
00:17:24.848 --> 00:17:27.728
- Yeah.
- Listen to you can't.

394
00:17:27.728 --> 00:17:30.062
no sleeping on this job
because if you sleep

395
00:17:30.062 --> 00:17:31.907
you'll. you'll die. man.

396
00:17:31.907 --> 00:17:33.180
Are you ready?

397
00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:35.077
- I'm ready.
- Okay.

398
00:17:35.077 --> 00:17:36.856
We'll have a cup of
coffee after the meeting

399
00:17:36.856 --> 00:17:38.450
and we'll work out the details. all right?

400
00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:39.283
- All right.

401
00:17:39.283 --> 00:17:40.273

402
00:17:40.273 --> 00:17:42.369
All right. let's go.

403
00:17:42.369 --> 00:17:43.310
Okay. let's figure it out.

Whatever we did. it was.
it wasn't. uh. selfish.

536
00:27:08.846 --> 00:27:10.644
It wasn't just about us.

537
00:27:10.644 --> 00:27:12.069
It was for the family.

538
00:27:12.069 --> 00:27:15.554
I mean. what we did. we had to do.

539
00:27:15.554 --> 00:27:19.206
- You never told me anything about this.

540
00:27:19.206 --> 00:27:21.417
I'm here for a certain amount
of time. but you know what?

541
00:27:21.417 --> 00:27:24.034
I'm gonna stay a little bit longer.

542
00:27:24.034 --> 00:27:28.337
- This wasn't a selfish.
motivated move. believe me.

543
00:27:28.337 --> 00:27:32.145
We were thinking of all
of us. including you.

544
00:27:32.145 --> 00:27:34.636
- I want a meeting tomorrow.

545
00:27:34.636 --> 00:27:38.475
And you make sure that Joe is with you.

546
00:27:38.475 --> 00:27:40.180
You got it?

547
00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:41.097
- Tomorrow?

548
00:27:42.307 --> 00:27:43.474
Does Joe know?

549
00:27:44.718 --> 00:27:46.723
I'll reach out to Joe.

550
00:27:46.723 --> 00:27:47.556
Yeah.

551
00:27:48.704 --> 00:27:51.111
Yeah. but don't. don't feel that way.

552
00:27:51.111 --> 00:27:52.552
I'll see you tomorrow.

553
00:27:52.552 --> 00:27:54.738
We'll both be there.

554
00:27:54.738 --> 00:27:56.321
All right. bye-bye.

555
00:27:59.262 --> 00:28:02.179
(woman vocalizing)

556
00:28:25.235 --> 00:28:26.262
- (speaks Italian). John.

557
00:28:26.262 --> 00:28:28.397
- (speaks Italian). Joe.
- (speaks Italian)

558
00:28:28.397 --> 00:28:32.147
- Eh. Joe. (speaks Italian).

559
00:28:34.108 --> 00:28:35.516
- Eh. Snake. (speaks Italian)?

560
00:28:35.516 --> 00:28:39.016
- Snake (speaks Italian).

561
00:28:41.619 --> 00:28:43.933
(Joe speaking Italian)

562
00:28:43.933 --> 00:28:47.266
(John speaking Italian)

563
00:28:49.142 --> 00:28:51.326
(Joe speaking Italian)

564
00:28:51.326 --> 00:28:53.486
(John speaking Italian)

565
00:28:53.486 --> 00:28:56.066
(Joe speaking Italian)

566
00:28:56.066 --> 00:28:56.899
(John speaking Italian)
(Joe speaking Italian)

567
00:28:56.899 --> 00:28:58.590
- All right. Joe.

568
00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:01.725
(footsteps rustling)

569
00:29:01.725 --> 00:29:04.808
(suspenseful music)

570
00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:45.925
- So. Styles. I gotta
tell you something. okay?

571
00:29:45.925 --> 00:29:48.402
This is some serious stuff going on here.

572
00:29:48.402 --> 00:29:50.151
We can't control it if you don't follow

573
00:29:50.151 --> 00:29:52.169
directions a hundred percent.

574
00:29:52.169 --> 00:29:53.708
We're gonna all get whacked.

575
00:29:53.708 --> 00:29:55.060
Your family. gone.

576
00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:56.533
We're gonna get whacked. too.

577
00:29:56.533 --> 00:29:57.366
Giuseppe.

578
00:29:57.366 --> 00:29:59.538
- Styles. we meet again.
- Yeah.

579
00:29:59.538 --> 00:30:00.621
How ya doin'?

580
00:30:01.549 --> 00:30:02.517
- What happened?

581
00:30:02.517 --> 00:30:03.873
- They ambushed us.

582
00:30:03.873 --> 00:30:05.314
Came out and took out Snakes.

583
00:30:05.314 --> 00:30:07.525
They killed my whole crew.

584
00:30:07.525 --> 00:30:09.313
You even look like one of
the guys. I don't know.

585
00:30:09.313 --> 00:30:11.279
We just all got ambushed. man.

586
00:30:11.279 --> 00:30:12.477
- Well. it definitely wasn't us.

587
00:30:12.477 --> 00:30:13.957
but we know who did it.

588
00:30:13.957 --> 00:30:17.290
And the team that did it
is a very powerful crew.

589
00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:19.792
They're actually higher
than our development here.

590
00:30:19.792 --> 00:30:22.077
so we have to play this
chess game perfectly.

591
00:30:22.077 --> 00:30:24.896
otherwise we're all gonna
be in a world of shit.

592
00:30:24.896 --> 00:30:27.176
So your cell phone's been destroyed

593
00:30:27.176 --> 00:30:28.680
because if they woulda tracked you here

594
00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.799
and know that you're alive.

595
00:30:29.799 --> 00:30:32.462
they'll come and kill
your family and your kids.

596
00:30:32.462 --> 00:30:35.136
So it's important. all right.
give him another phone. John.

597
00:30:35.136 --> 00:30:35.969
- Okay.

598
00:30:35.969 --> 00:30:39.246
So Styles. listen and
listen carefully. okay?

599
00:30:39.246 --> 00:30:40.715
This phone has been sensitized. man.

600
00:30:40.715 --> 00:30:43.395
It's fully clean. untraceable.

601
00:30:43.395 --> 00:30:46.555
That means you only call who
we tell you you can call.

602
00:30:46.555 --> 00:30:49.485
Anybody tries to trace it.
it's gonna go to Taiwan.

603
00:30:49.485 --> 00:30:51.275
Okay. so be careful with this.

604
00:30:51.275 --> 00:30:55.936
They'll find you and your
family if you mess up.

605
00:30:55.936 --> 00:30:57.003
You got me?

606
00:30:57.003 --> 00:30:57.836
- [Styles] Gotcha.

607
00:30:57.836 --> 00:30:59.069
- This'll be over in a couple of months.

608
00:30:59.069 --> 00:31:03.110
We'll need you to stay
put in the safe house.

609
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:05.811
- Listen. I'm reading
your body language. man.

610
00:31:05.811 --> 00:31:07.157
And I'm reading the anger.

611
00:31:07.157 --> 00:31:08.166
I get it.

612
00:31:08.166 --> 00:31:11.588
You saw everyone you know
and care about killed.

613
00:31:11.588 --> 00:31:13.322
but I'll tell you who didn't get killed.

614
00:31:13.322 --> 00:31:15.476
You didn't get killed.
and your wife and kids

615
00:31:15.476 --> 00:31:18.336
didn't get killed. and you
wanna keep it that way.

616
00:31:18.336 --> 00:31:20.219
So don't go off script.

617
00:31:20.219 --> 00:31:21.912
Don't go being a hero.

618
00:31:21.912 --> 00:31:24.444
Stay put. he'll let you
know when it's time for you

619
00:31:24.444 --> 00:31:26.017
to do something. you understand that?

620
00:31:26.017 --> 00:31:26.879
You got me?

621
00:31:26.879 --> 00:31:29.046
Don't mess up. understand?

622
00:31:30.447 --> 00:31:31.368
- I understand.

623
00:31:31.368 --> 00:31:32.921
I'll play this game.

624
00:31:32.921 --> 00:31:35.438
I'll do whatever it is you ask me to do.

625
00:31:35.438 --> 00:31:39.583
but when I resurface. I'm
coming back with a vengeance.

626
00:31:39.583 --> 00:31:41.008
- Granted.

627
00:31:41.008 --> 00:31:42.078
Okay. John. take him out.

628
00:31:42.078 --> 00:31:43.038
- Eh. Joe.
- Got it.

629
00:31:43.038 --> 00:31:44.621
- Styles. let's go.

630
00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:54.743
(woman singing in foreign language)

631
00:32:26.886 --> 00:32:29.969
(cell phone ringing)

632
00:32:35.687 --> 00:32:36.520
- Hello.

633
00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:38.593
- Adeet.

634
00:32:41.829 --> 00:32:44.922
Good to hear your voice again.

635
00:32:44.922 --> 00:32:47.047
I'm afraid I'm not calling to say hi.

636
00:32:47.047 --> 00:32:48.305
(fountain water burbling)

637
00:32:48.305 --> 00:32:49.669
- Well. I have to be honest with you.

638
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:52.559
I didn't think I was
gonna hear from you now.

639
00:32:52.559 --> 00:32:55.172
- We've got a problem.

640
00:32:55.172 --> 00:32:58.874
- But. I will say it is
good to hear your voice.

641
00:32:58.874 --> 00:33:00.800
- There was a major hit
here from the council.

642
00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:03.300
Hit our interests pretty hard.

643
00:33:05.661 --> 00:33:07.411
There's a war coming.

644
00:33:09.378 --> 00:33:12.620
We need you on our side again.

645
00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:15.950
- Was it the council that put out the hit?

646
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:18.091
- You remember when our fathers went into

647
00:33:18.091 --> 00:33:20.708
that meeting one time from the council.

648
00:33:20.708 --> 00:33:24.303
you and I were probably
about 16 years old then.

649
00:33:24.303 --> 00:33:25.847
We went into the grand ballroom.

650
00:33:25.847 --> 00:33:27.167
we snuck around the back.

651
00:33:27.167 --> 00:33:28.666
We were told we weren't
allowed in the meeting.

652
00:33:28.666 --> 00:33:30.641
but we heard everything
that was in the meeting.

653
00:33:30.641 --> 00:33:34.224
We stood on our knees.
listening to that meeting

654
00:33:34.224 --> 00:33:36.307
for two and a half hours.

655
00:33:37.445 --> 00:33:40.296
And when we both left.
we promised ourselves

656
00:33:40.296 --> 00:33:43.812
that when it was time
for us to run the family.

657
00:33:43.812 --> 00:33:45.627
we knew that we needed to make a change.

658
00:33:45.627 --> 00:33:48.926
We knew that the council was not

659
00:33:48.926 --> 00:33:51.893
gonna put us in their big plan.

660
00:33:51.893 --> 00:33:54.867
They tried to rub our fathers
out. but they couldn't.

661
00:33:54.867 --> 00:33:58.388
But you knew that they
were gonna rub us out.

662
00:33:58.388 --> 00:34:00.888
- Yeah. I remember those days.

663
00:34:02.712 --> 00:34:05.357
Seemed a bit simpler. huh?

664
00:34:05.357 --> 00:34:08.971
Feels like now we're just
going to war with everybody.

665
00:34:08.971 --> 00:34:09.804
Shame.

666
00:34:11.112 --> 00:34:13.741
- As much as I don't wanna
say this. my old friend.

667
00:34:13.741 --> 00:34:14.692
I need you to come back.

668
00:34:14.692 --> 00:34:18.275
We need to take care
of business once more.

669
00:34:19.574 --> 00:34:20.827
- Even when we was kids
(fountain water burbling)

670
00:34:20.827 --> 00:34:22.875
at 16 years old.

671
00:34:22.875 --> 00:34:25.610
you and I were ready to run the family.

672
00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:27.194
And they knew that.

673
00:34:28.395 --> 00:34:31.398
You know. the council
has about 20.000 men.

674
00:34:31.398 --> 00:34:33.509
We don't have anything close to that.

675
00:34:33.509 --> 00:34:36.645
How do you plan on winning this?

676
00:34:36.645 --> 00:34:38.978
Okay. I'm in. you know that.

677
00:34:39.935 --> 00:34:41.587
I'll take the first plane out tomorrow.

678
00:34:41.587 --> 00:34:43.804
(woman singing in foreign
language continues)

679
00:34:43.804 --> 00:34:47.059
- No need for that. I've
sent my plane to get you now.

680
00:34:47.059 --> 00:34:50.456
It should be arriving in three hours.

681
00:34:50.456 --> 00:34:52.426
Have a safe journey.

682
00:34:52.426 --> 00:34:54.858
I'll see you when you arrive.

683
00:34:54.858 --> 00:34:56.797
(Joe speaks Italian)

684
00:34:56.797 --> 00:34:58.172
- That works.

685
00:34:58.172 --> 00:34:59.588
Okay.

686
00:34:59.588 --> 00:35:01.894
And I'll look forward to
seeing your plane here tonight.

687
00:35:01.894 --> 00:35:05.061
(tense ominous music)

688
00:35:24.104 --> 00:35:27.604
(gentle foreboding music)

689
00:35:31.876 --> 00:35:32.722
- I don't know. you really think

690
00:35:32.722 --> 00:35:35.212
there's something to worry about?

691
00:35:35.212 --> 00:35:38.719
- Look. the whole thing
just seems out of place.

692
00:35:38.719 --> 00:35:40.504
I mean. the fact that they did not tell us

693
00:35:40.504 --> 00:35:43.555
about the hit leads me to believe

694
00:35:43.555 --> 00:35:47.091
that they don't want us in
to what's going on. right?

695
00:35:47.091 --> 00:35:49.356
Why would not. why wouldn't
they reach out to us

696
00:35:49.356 --> 00:35:51.251
and let us know that
they were gonna do it?

697
00:35:51.251 --> 00:35:52.725
Even if we were against it.

698
00:35:52.725 --> 00:35:54.323
- Yeah. but we haven't heard anything.

699
00:35:54.323 --> 00:35:55.919
There's nothing definitely concrete.

700
00:35:55.919 --> 00:35:57.643
- Oh. I heard it for sure.

701
00:35:57.643 --> 00:36:02.345
Yeah. they. it is confirmed
that they did the hit.

702
00:36:02.345 --> 00:36:05.076
I think the problem was the hit.

703
00:36:05.076 --> 00:36:09.981
We had the Harlem family make
the hit on the social club.

704
00:36:09.981 --> 00:36:12.357
Now when they sat us down at.

705
00:36:12.357 --> 00:36:14.644
you know when I was
being drilled over this.

706
00:36:14.644 --> 00:36:16.784
I never told them who put the hit on it.

707
00:36:16.784 --> 00:36:20.242
I just said that the hit came from us.

708
00:36:20.242 --> 00:36:23.458
But what I'm thinking
is that piece of shit.

709
00:36:23.458 --> 00:36:27.666
Jocko from Sicily. looked
into it a little bit further.

710
00:36:27.666 --> 00:36:30.712
dug his nose where it don't belong.

711
00:36:30.712 --> 00:36:33.224
and wanted to make a
sweet commotion about it.

712
00:36:33.224 --> 00:36:37.357
And to show us that
they know about it now.

713
00:36:37.357 --> 00:36:39.104
they killed 45 of them.

714
00:36:39.104 --> 00:36:41.024
- [Carmine] The old man
is going to be here today?

715
00:36:41.024 --> 00:36:42.166
- The Don will be here.

716
00:36:42.166 --> 00:36:42.999
- [Carmine] He will.

717
00:36:42.999 --> 00:36:45.373
How many guys are gonna be with him?

718
00:36:45.373 --> 00:36:48.123
- Uh. my sources say at least 60.

719
00:36:51.577 --> 00:36:55.494
- If they have any intent
to either shelving us

720
00:36:56.953 --> 00:36:59.948
or removing us completely.

721
00:36:59.948 --> 00:37:02.385
they can do it anytime
they want. let's face it.

722
00:37:02.385 --> 00:37:03.877
He's got the power.

723
00:37:03.877 --> 00:37:05.990
He's got the word.

724
00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:08.318
And all he's gotta do is
give his word and we're gone.

725
00:37:08.318 --> 00:37:10.297
- Well. I have a secret weapon.

726
00:37:10.297 --> 00:37:11.417
- What's that?

727
00:37:11.417 --> 00:37:12.296
- Something we've been working on

728
00:37:12.296 --> 00:37:13.782
for the last couple of years.

729
00:37:13.782 --> 00:37:15.157
It's. it's revolutionary.

730
00:37:15.157 --> 00:37:16.177
It's mind-blowing.

731
00:37:16.177 --> 00:37:18.833
We've put all of our interests
in the last couple of years.

732
00:37:18.833 --> 00:37:22.559
since the first hit.
on this new technology

733
00:37:22.559 --> 00:37:24.086
that. uh. that I'd like to show you.

734
00:37:24.086 --> 00:37:25.211
(cell phone ringing)
Hold on a second.

735
00:37:25.211 --> 00:37:26.669
Let me get this.

736
00:37:26.669 --> 00:37:28.053
Hello?

737
00:37:28.053 --> 00:37:29.739
- Hey. Joe. yeah.

738
00:37:29.739 --> 00:37:31.678
Listen. we cannot confirm that the meeting

739
00:37:31.678 --> 00:37:32.916
you and Carmine are going to

740
00:37:32.916 --> 00:37:34.643
is an assassination attempt.

741
00:37:34.643 --> 00:37:36.391
Now. all the information.
we don't have anything.

742
00:37:36.391 --> 00:37:39.009
But listen. you have
to go to this meeting.

743
00:37:39.009 --> 00:37:42.067
If you don't go. it's an all out war.

744
00:37:42.067 --> 00:37:42.900
- Okay.

745
00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:49.227
All right. just get the men ready.

746
00:37:49.227 --> 00:37:50.111
- We're ready to go.

747
00:37:50.111 --> 00:37:51.719
We got guys. and we've
got a couple of guys

748
00:37:51.719 --> 00:37:54.277
they don't even know about
on the inside. all right?

749
00:37:54.277 --> 00:37:55.329
Listen. keep in touch.

750
00:37:55.329 --> 00:37:56.914
Let me know how it goes. all right. Joe?

751
00:37:56.914 --> 00:37:57.747
All right.

752
00:37:57.747 --> 00:37:59.830
- And wait for my signal.

753
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:03.728
All right. my team can't confirm

754
00:38:03.728 --> 00:38:05.888
if this is definitely
going to be a hit or not.

755
00:38:05.888 --> 00:38:08.221
so I think we're 50-50 here.

756
00:38:09.984 --> 00:38:11.666
- Here's what I think.

757
00:38:11.666 --> 00:38:13.441
We go in. we try and case.

758
00:38:13.441 --> 00:38:17.108
and get a feel for the
room and who's there.

759
00:38:22.202 --> 00:38:24.616
Look. we've been through
this a hundred times.

760
00:38:24.616 --> 00:38:26.927
usually on the other end.

761
00:38:26.927 --> 00:38:31.554
If we go in and after a
certain point they separate us.

762
00:38:31.554 --> 00:38:34.824
I think that's a telltale
sign we're in deep shit.

763
00:38:34.824 --> 00:38:37.829
Uh. so we're gonna have to have a plan.

764
00:38:37.829 --> 00:38:39.787
I mean. we just can't go in there

765
00:38:39.787 --> 00:38:41.466
and. uh. and lay down for these guys.

766
00:38:41.466 --> 00:38:44.191
If they. if they got
that kind of intentions.

767
00:38:44.191 --> 00:38:45.979
I wanna at least go out fighting.

768
00:38:45.979 --> 00:38:46.812
- I agree.

769
00:38:46.812 --> 00:38:49.385
If they separate us. they're gonna execute

770
00:38:49.385 --> 00:38:51.189
one of us or both of us.

771
00:38:51.189 --> 00:38:53.106
We can't take a chance.

772
00:38:54.041 --> 00:38:55.491
The separation is not good.

773
00:38:55.491 --> 00:38:56.774
If the meeting doesn't go as planned.

774
00:38:56.774 --> 00:38:59.607
if they don't hear what they want.

775
00:39:00.876 --> 00:39:02.025
you're gonna have to be the one

776
00:39:02.025 --> 00:39:03.470
to do what you have to do.

777
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:06.622
because they'll assassinate me before you.

778
00:39:06.622 --> 00:39:08.200
So if they separate us and they take you

779
00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.498
to a. to a separate room and they can't

780
00:39:10.498 --> 00:39:11.697
strike a deal with you.

781
00:39:11.697 --> 00:39:13.364
or they feel that you'll retaliate.

782
00:39:13.364 --> 00:39:15.900
which they know how close we are.

783
00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:17.228
they'll probably kill you. too.

784
00:39:17.228 --> 00:39:18.913
So you'll have to get the first chance.

785
00:39:18.913 --> 00:39:20.457
You go in that room.

786
00:39:20.457 --> 00:39:22.439
You ask to be excused.

787
00:39:22.439 --> 00:39:25.138
You come out and you just
start blowing everybody away.

788
00:39:25.138 --> 00:39:26.846
And we'll meet up with you.

789
00:39:26.846 --> 00:39:29.721
- I haven't carried a piece
in about 15. 20 years.

790
00:39:29.721 --> 00:39:31.916
- Today's gonna be the day (chuckles).

791
00:39:31.916 --> 00:39:32.878
Here you go.

792
00:39:32.878 --> 00:39:35.777
You got eight shots in there.

793
00:39:35.777 --> 00:39:37.617
- We don't know how many
guys are there. do we?

794
00:39:37.617 --> 00:39:38.647
- I don't. but I would imagine

795
00:39:38.647 --> 00:39:39.772
if they take you to a room

796
00:39:39.772 --> 00:39:42.620
there's not gonna be any
more than five to eight.

797
00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:43.950
- Let's hope not.

798
00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:46.236
- We'll hear the gunshots.

799
00:39:46.236 --> 00:39:49.153
We already have people ready to go.

800
00:39:51.152 --> 00:39:52.262
We'll at least get by today.

801
00:39:52.262 --> 00:39:54.575
We'll just plan for what comes after next.

802
00:39:54.575 --> 00:39:56.433
Let's just hope it's a stiff fine.

803
00:39:56.433 --> 00:39:57.462
That's what I'm hoping for.

804
00:39:57.462 --> 00:39:58.425
- Oh. they may shelve us.

805
00:39:58.425 --> 00:39:59.327
That's what I'm thinking.

806
00:39:59.327 --> 00:40:00.769
My gut feeling is they shelve us.

807
00:40:00.769 --> 00:40:02.776
They put us both on the shelf.

808
00:40:02.776 --> 00:40:05.178
they put their own guys in from Italy.

809
00:40:05.178 --> 00:40:06.053
They've been doing that shit now.

810
00:40:06.053 --> 00:40:07.675
That's like a regular thing. you know?

811
00:40:07.675 --> 00:40:09.129
- Yeah. but that's not
gonna work for my family.

812
00:40:09.129 --> 00:40:11.671
- No. me neither. but. you know.

813
00:40:11.671 --> 00:40:13.794
It might work for his and
that's what I'm afraid of.

814
00:40:13.794 --> 00:40:14.966
- We got guys ready to go.

815
00:40:14.966 --> 00:40:15.984
but these two guys right here

816
00:40:15.984 --> 00:40:18.579
can take on 50 men at least.

817
00:40:18.579 --> 00:40:20.123
- [Carmine] Okay.

818
00:40:20.123 --> 00:40:22.710
- Look. I'm hoping it's just a stiff fine.

819
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:24.390
We get a stiff fine.

820
00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:25.955
we pay the fine and that's it.

821
00:40:25.955 --> 00:40:27.024
- [Carmine] You think he would come in

822
00:40:27.024 --> 00:40:27.931
all the way from Italy.

823
00:40:27.931 --> 00:40:31.401
and have his whole crew
here if it was just a fine?

824
00:40:31.401 --> 00:40:32.234
- No. I don't.

825
00:40:32.234 --> 00:40:33.453
I think this is something serious.

826
00:40:33.453 --> 00:40:34.936
and I don't think we're gonna like

827
00:40:34.936 --> 00:40:36.496
the outcome of this meeting one bit.

828
00:40:36.496 --> 00:40:37.329
- [Carmine] No.

829
00:40:37.329 --> 00:40:38.239
- Honestly. if it wasn't for you.

830
00:40:38.239 --> 00:40:40.249
I probably would not even go.

831
00:40:40.249 --> 00:40:43.109
But we can't confirm right now

832
00:40:43.109 --> 00:40:45.276
that it's a hit from my sources.

833
00:40:45.276 --> 00:40:48.943
so on the inside the
meeting could go 50-50.

834
00:40:50.239 --> 00:40:51.110
All right. so we agree.

835
00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:54.618
you get separated. you start immediately.

836
00:40:54.618 --> 00:40:57.603
You take down whoever's in
the room and then it's on.

837
00:40:57.603 --> 00:40:59.614
- Okay.
- Okay. let's go.

838
00:40:59.614 --> 00:41:00.856
- [Carmine] Let's do it.

839
00:41:00.856 --> 00:41:05.189
(gentle foreboding music continues)

840
00:41:06.232 --> 00:41:08.864
(car engine rumbling)

841
00:41:08.864 --> 00:41:13.197
(gentle foreboding music continues)

842
00:41:25.466 --> 00:41:26.466
- [Joe] Don.

843
00:41:32.884 --> 00:41:35.455
- Thank you. boys. for coming.

844
00:41:35.455 --> 00:41:38.205
We appreciate that you showed up.

845
00:41:39.066 --> 00:41:42.937
I mean. with all this guessing games.

846
00:41:42.937 --> 00:41:45.486
- Well. you've certainly been
busy the last 24 hours. right?

847
00:41:45.486 --> 00:41:49.903
Making a ruckus and definitely
getting our attention.

848
00:41:51.603 --> 00:41:56.348
- Well. there's. there's
things that I'm not used to.

849
00:41:56.348 --> 00:42:00.681
In Sicily. we don't. we
don't handle things the way.

850
00:42:01.515 --> 00:42:05.348
but respect and order
is most important to us.

851
00:42:07.253 --> 00:42:08.693
- [Man Sitting At Desk] I agree.

852
00:42:08.693 --> 00:42:09.526
- Well. they're here for us.

853
00:42:09.526 --> 00:42:11.139
I don't remember seeing them

854
00:42:11.139 --> 00:42:12.733
in the last two weeks when I got shot.

855
00:42:12.733 --> 00:42:14.304
- Yeah. we didn't get
any communication when-

856
00:42:14.304 --> 00:42:16.836
- [Giacomo] Wait. wait.
wait. did you respond to us.

857
00:42:16.836 --> 00:42:18.634
or did you go on your own?

858
00:42:18.634 --> 00:42:22.389
We knew nothing. and
that's why we're here.

859
00:42:22.389 --> 00:42:24.973
I keep repeating myself.

860
00:42:24.973 --> 00:42:28.519
We're here because we want to communicate.

861
00:42:28.519 --> 00:42:31.847
We have to know exactly what's going on.

862
00:42:31.847 --> 00:42:34.258
Not just a little bit waiting for some.

863
00:42:34.258 --> 00:42:37.614
you say. an informant. bullshit informant.

864
00:42:37.614 --> 00:42:39.531
We wanna know from you.

865
00:42:40.622 --> 00:42:42.589
Not that we have to go looking around

866
00:42:42.589 --> 00:42:44.760
to see what's going on.

867
00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:45.805
- I think maybe you're forgetting

868
00:42:45.805 --> 00:42:47.640
that the Molinari family combined

869
00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:50.899
with Carmine's family and
all of our American families.

870
00:42:50.899 --> 00:42:53.581
give you $80 million a year.

871
00:42:53.581 --> 00:42:57.071
Wouldn't you suggest to
maybe lend a helping hand

872
00:42:57.071 --> 00:42:58.826
for one of the heads of the family members

873
00:42:58.826 --> 00:43:01.396
to have been. attempted
to be assassinated?

874
00:43:01.396 --> 00:43:03.590
Wouldn't you lend a hand over?

875
00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:05.602
Uh. that wasn't such the case.

876
00:43:05.602 --> 00:43:08.923
Uh. in fact. you know. no disrespect here.

877
00:43:08.923 --> 00:43:10.966
but your organization collectively

878
00:43:10.966 --> 00:43:13.461
made only 19 million in Sicily.

879
00:43:13.461 --> 00:43:16.118
when we give you $80 million a year.

880
00:43:16.118 --> 00:43:18.014
and our combined American families

881
00:43:18.014 --> 00:43:20.466
make over $800 million a year.

882
00:43:20.466 --> 00:43:22.533
So I don't understand what the issue is

883
00:43:22.533 --> 00:43:24.425
when you're getting paid more and more.

884
00:43:24.425 --> 00:43:27.449
and then the last five years
there's been 25% increase

885
00:43:27.449 --> 00:43:29.274
in the revenue that we've given.

886
00:43:29.274 --> 00:43:30.769
What could be more important

887
00:43:30.769 --> 00:43:35.134
than what's going on
with the revenue stream?

888
00:43:35.134 --> 00:43:37.926
- I don't like the way you handled it.

889
00:43:37.926 --> 00:43:40.556
- And we didn't know about it.

890
00:43:40.556 --> 00:43:42.826
- You say that we knew about it.

891
00:43:42.826 --> 00:43:43.777
Go ahead and speak to them.

892
00:43:43.777 --> 00:43:45.255
- Yeah. you said we knew about it.

893
00:43:45.255 --> 00:43:46.646
but we didn't know about it.

894
00:43:46.646 --> 00:43:48.454
We had to find out about it.

895
00:43:48.454 --> 00:43:50.641
- [Joe] Well. you knew
that the hit came from us.

896
00:43:50.641 --> 00:43:53.162
I didn't go into specifics on who exactly

897
00:43:53.162 --> 00:43:56.079
killed everyone in the social club.

898
00:43:58.155 --> 00:43:59.937
- Yeah. but you know.
you're supposed to be

899
00:43:59.937 --> 00:44:04.937
trusted (exhales loudly)
and represent the family.

900
00:44:05.217 --> 00:44:06.337
Your father was trusted.

901
00:44:06.337 --> 00:44:08.171
You took over. but I don't understand

902
00:44:08.171 --> 00:44:11.838
how you do this without
us knowing about it.

903
00:44:13.475 --> 00:44:14.863
- [Joe] Well. gee. I didn't
know there was any rules.

904
00:44:14.863 --> 00:44:16.156
especially when there's an attempted

905
00:44:16.156 --> 00:44:18.462
assassination on my life.

906
00:44:18.462 --> 00:44:20.713
- Yeah. but we're here
also to protect you. too.

907
00:44:20.713 --> 00:44:21.878
- [Joe] Where were you?

908
00:44:21.878 --> 00:44:22.711
- Where were we?

909
00:44:22.711 --> 00:44:24.966
- [Joe] Yeah. two weeks
with a bullet in my stomach.

910
00:44:24.966 --> 00:44:26.594
killing everybody that was involved.

911
00:44:26.594 --> 00:44:28.628
and I had. I had no help from Sicily.

912
00:44:28.628 --> 00:44:29.700
Why would I ask for this?
- [Carmine] Silence.

913
00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:31.539
Yeah. the silence was. you
know. it spoke volumes.

914
00:44:31.539 --> 00:44:32.585
I mean. we were sitting there thinking

915
00:44:32.585 --> 00:44:34.299
maybe you guys turned your back on us.

916
00:44:34.299 --> 00:44:36.909
- [Joe] And you know. you
still got your vig every month.

917
00:44:36.909 --> 00:44:38.698
- The move was made. and
the reason it was made

918
00:44:38.698 --> 00:44:42.192
was to keep the heat off of us and you.

919
00:44:42.192 --> 00:44:45.163
We. that's the whole reason
this went down this way.

920
00:44:45.163 --> 00:44:47.027
You remember what the old story was?

921
00:44:47.027 --> 00:44:49.515
And maybe. you know.
people seem to forget.

922
00:44:49.515 --> 00:44:52.869
you got those guys in the
clubs and in those bars.

923
00:44:52.869 --> 00:44:55.034
they're nothing but big mouths.

924
00:44:55.034 --> 00:44:56.659
We never operated that way.

925
00:44:56.659 --> 00:44:58.699
His father never operated that way.

926
00:44:58.699 --> 00:45:00.805
It was always the shadows.

927
00:45:00.805 --> 00:45:01.638
Do you remember?

928
00:45:01.638 --> 00:45:03.800
We used to use that term a lot.

929
00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:04.633
Do you remember?

930
00:45:04.633 --> 00:45:05.466
- [Giacomo] Yeah. I remember.

931
00:45:05.466 --> 00:45:07.444
- Well. it's the same way we handled this.

932
00:45:07.444 --> 00:45:10.296
We kept ourselves out of it so that

933
00:45:10.296 --> 00:45:12.373
if anybody was gonna
go down and get caught

934
00:45:12.373 --> 00:45:15.915
or do time and get pinched.
it wouldn't come back to us.

935
00:45:15.915 --> 00:45:19.038
We stayed out of it.
which kept you out of it.

936
00:45:19.038 --> 00:45:21.261
So I don't know why all
the feelings are hurt.

937
00:45:21.261 --> 00:45:23.463
We know you had to hear of it.

938
00:45:23.463 --> 00:45:26.197
When a boss gets shot. that
word travels around the world.

939
00:45:26.197 --> 00:45:27.084
You got to know about it.

940
00:45:27.084 --> 00:45:28.917
- [Giacomo] Gentlemen.

941
00:45:30.123 --> 00:45:30.956
That's not the way we-

942
00:45:30.956 --> 00:45:32.240
- We're your number one earner.

943
00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:35.990
$80 million a year is
what's given to Sicily.

944
00:45:39.292 --> 00:45:42.630
- [Giacomo] I just said
it's not the money here.

945
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:44.337
We appreciate it.

946
00:45:44.337 --> 00:45:45.266
And we're making money.

947
00:45:45.266 --> 00:45:47.650
- So if it's not about the
money. what is it about?

948
00:45:47.650 --> 00:45:48.517
- [Man Sitting At Desk] Honor.

949
00:45:48.517 --> 00:45:51.347
- So you're mad because the black family

950
00:45:51.347 --> 00:45:53.373
in Harlem hit the social club?

951
00:45:53.373 --> 00:45:55.387
Would you have rather
than an Italian hit it?

952
00:45:55.387 --> 00:45:56.220
Is that what this is?

953
00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:58.713
Are we on now on the same level
as the social club people?

954
00:45:58.713 --> 00:46:00.932
I thought we were the
people running the scenes.

955
00:46:00.932 --> 00:46:04.258
- The reason that decision
was made. honestly.

956
00:46:04.258 --> 00:46:07.801
was to keep the heat off of us and you.

957
00:46:07.801 --> 00:46:09.868
- Well. the reason why I came down here.

958
00:46:09.868 --> 00:46:13.018
because there's a
problem here in New York.

959
00:46:13.018 --> 00:46:15.644
And I didn't come down here to sightsee.

960
00:46:15.644 --> 00:46:17.477
So I'm not very happy.

961
00:46:18.553 --> 00:46:21.229
- It was too quick of a
decision we had to make.

962
00:46:21.229 --> 00:46:23.041
- [Man Sitting At Desk] We have to know.

963
00:46:23.041 --> 00:46:25.030
- We told you that the hit came from us.

964
00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:27.767
We didn't go into specifics.

965
00:46:27.767 --> 00:46:30.251
I don't see where the.
where. where the problem is.

966
00:46:30.251 --> 00:46:32.033
- [Giacomo] You don't
see where the problem is.

967
00:46:32.033 --> 00:46:34.200
- We found out afterwards.

968
00:46:35.963 --> 00:46:38.400
So as of right now. my
decision. and my final decision

969
00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:40.937
is I'm gonna shelf you. Joe.

970
00:46:40.937 --> 00:46:42.697
And that's the reason why we're here.

971
00:46:42.697 --> 00:46:44.241
because we didn't know.

972
00:46:44.241 --> 00:46:47.020
Anything he does. you
have to report to Carmine.

973
00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:48.638
and that's the way we gotta leave it.

974
00:46:48.638 --> 00:46:49.958
- I don't. I don't think you need

975
00:46:49.958 --> 00:46:53.058
to take these drastic measures.

976
00:46:53.058 --> 00:46:54.919
I think that's premature.

977
00:46:54.919 --> 00:46:58.090
Joe's been working with
me for a hundred years.

978
00:46:58.090 --> 00:47:00.967
You know. the relationship
I had with his father.

979
00:47:00.967 --> 00:47:02.632
I think that's premature.
and I don't think

980
00:47:02.632 --> 00:47:03.743
it's necessary.
- I respected his family.

981
00:47:03.743 --> 00:47:05.579
I respected his father. but Joe is being

982
00:47:05.579 --> 00:47:07.764
shelfed is my final decision.

983
00:47:07.764 --> 00:47:10.893
- Look. I respect Carmine.
but the Molinari family

984
00:47:10.893 --> 00:47:13.116
will not surrender to anyone.

985
00:47:13.116 --> 00:47:17.836
nor will it take orders
from any outside parties.

986
00:47:17.836 --> 00:47:19.634
Our organization stems to be powerful

987
00:47:19.634 --> 00:47:21.841
and wealthy at the same time.

988
00:47:21.841 --> 00:47:24.297
which we have achieved that.

989
00:47:24.297 --> 00:47:26.380
You went on this little rampage

990
00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:28.725
where you decided to assassinate 45 people

991
00:47:28.725 --> 00:47:30.404
that were under my protection.

992
00:47:30.404 --> 00:47:32.616
made me look like a total jackass.

993
00:47:32.616 --> 00:47:35.848
You shut the whole American
family situation down.

994
00:47:35.848 --> 00:47:38.445
You've actually disrupted
the revenue chain.

995
00:47:38.445 --> 00:47:42.461
Now the whole system in Harlem
is disrupted because of you.

996
00:47:42.461 --> 00:47:44.402
You've absolutely annihilated the people

997
00:47:44.402 --> 00:47:46.829
who were running that.

998
00:47:46.829 --> 00:47:49.794
So if it's a matter of a fine. gentlemen.

999
00:47:49.794 --> 00:47:52.821
I'm okay with it. but I
will not be laying down

1000
00:47:52.821 --> 00:47:54.488
to any family today.

1001
00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:56.776
- There's no excuse for this.

1002
00:47:56.776 --> 00:47:59.618
I didn't come all the
way from Sicily for this.

1003
00:47:59.618 --> 00:48:02.356
Joe. I'm gonna shelve you. Joe.

1004
00:48:02.356 --> 00:48:05.789
Carmine. will you excuse me and Joe?

1005
00:48:05.789 --> 00:48:07.175
And Joe alone.

1006
00:48:07.175 --> 00:48:08.342
I dismiss you.

1007
00:48:20.012 --> 00:48:23.469
- Look. I'm not trying to
upset anything here. okay?

1008
00:48:23.469 --> 00:48:27.386
At the end of the day.
I'm all about the money.

1009
00:48:31.287 --> 00:48:34.050
Whoa. give me 30 seconds.

1010
00:48:34.050 --> 00:48:35.760
Okay. give me 30 seconds to explain

1011
00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:38.036
what the Molinari family
is doing right now.

1012
00:48:38.036 --> 00:48:42.181
marrying artificial technology.
AI. with human robotics.

1013
00:48:42.181 --> 00:48:45.286
It's gonna revolutionize
our revenue chain.

1014
00:48:45.286 --> 00:48:46.338
Just give me 30 seconds.

1015
00:48:46.338 --> 00:48:48.606
I'll even set my alarm here.

1016
00:48:48.606 --> 00:48:50.283
That's all I want.
(watch beeping)

1017
00:48:50.283 --> 00:48:52.661
If you don't like it. you can kill me.

1018
00:48:52.661 --> 00:48:56.578
The Molinari family has been
combining AI intelligence.

1019
00:48:56.578 --> 00:48:59.719
combined with nanotechnology
and human robotics.

1020
00:48:59.719 --> 00:49:01.013
We have been making robots.

1021
00:49:01.013 --> 00:49:03.421
They're 10 times faster.
stronger. and smarter

1022
00:49:03.421 --> 00:49:05.065
than the average human being.

1023
00:49:05.065 --> 00:49:08.819
And the T25 should be
here any minute to get me.

1024
00:49:08.819 --> 00:49:09.940
- What the fuck you talking

1025
00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:13.273
about. Joe?
(gun firing)

1026
00:49:17.814 --> 00:49:19.672
- Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

1027
00:49:19.672 --> 00:49:21.559
Get Carmine out of the building.

1028
00:49:21.559 --> 00:49:25.794
Kill everyone here and return
him back to the villa safe.

1029
00:49:25.794 --> 00:49:28.211
(gun firing)

1030
00:49:31.225 --> 00:49:33.579
(keyboard clacking)

1031
00:49:33.579 --> 00:49:34.412
- Please!

1032
00:49:34.412 --> 00:49:37.162
(gunshot blasts)

1033
00:49:38.747 --> 00:49:40.520
- I've seen that before.

1034
00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:42.561
gunshot wound to the liver.

1035
00:49:42.561 --> 00:49:44.185
You don't have much time.

1036
00:49:44.185 --> 00:49:45.816
maybe 10 minutes.
(man groans)

1037
00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:47.919
This is all because of your foolish ways.

1038
00:49:47.919 --> 00:49:49.754
Come all the way down here from Sicily

1039
00:49:49.754 --> 00:49:52.837
and try to tell us how to run things.

1040
00:49:54.003 --> 00:49:56.447
Mark my words today that we're gonna kill

1041
00:49:56.447 --> 00:49:59.236
and annihilate every one of you.

1042
00:49:59.236 --> 00:50:00.653
You started this.

1043
00:50:09.015 --> 00:50:09.848
- Hold on.

1044
00:50:09.848 --> 00:50:11.065
Hold on. sir.

1045
00:50:11.065 --> 00:50:12.015
I gotta check you out.

1046
00:50:12.015 --> 00:50:12.895
- Oh. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

1047
00:50:12.895 --> 00:50:14.396
This is Carmine (laughs).

1048
00:50:14.396 --> 00:50:15.515
Dons don't carry guns.

1049
00:50:15.515 --> 00:50:16.348
- Oh. okay.
- Look at this guy.

1050
00:50:16.348 --> 00:50:17.181
he's ready for retirement.

1051
00:50:17.181 --> 00:50:18.558
- Okay. no disrespect.
- Let him go.

1052
00:50:18.558 --> 00:50:19.891
- No disrespect.

1053
00:50:21.093 --> 00:50:22.857
- Jesus. one misstep and
they're so afraid of you.

1054
00:50:22.857 --> 00:50:23.690
Come on.

1055
00:50:25.962 --> 00:50:28.436
- You're not afraid of me. right?

1056
00:50:28.436 --> 00:50:32.353
- Look. I. (laughs) of course.

1057
00:50:33.690 --> 00:50:36.857
(footsteps pattering)

1058
00:50:47.217 --> 00:50:50.634
(tense foreboding music)

1059
00:50:53.078 --> 00:50:54.198
- You used to work for this guy?

1060
00:50:54.198 --> 00:50:56.627
- (scoffs) Yeah. a long time ago.

1061
00:50:56.627 --> 00:50:57.854
Now I'm making twice as much.

1062
00:50:57.854 --> 00:50:58.985
and I don't have to about a corpse

1063
00:50:58.985 --> 00:50:59.871
breathing down my neck.

1064
00:50:59.871 --> 00:51:01.806
(men laughing)

1065
00:51:01.806 --> 00:51:02.703
- Yeah. he's a waste.

1066
00:51:02.703 --> 00:51:05.194
- Yeah. buddy. you
better think about that.

1067
00:51:05.194 --> 00:51:07.894
- Hey. listen. working
for the Salvatore family.

1068
00:51:07.894 --> 00:51:09.015
I like it a lot.

1069
00:51:09.015 --> 00:51:10.199
You know. let's just put it that way.

1070
00:51:10.199 --> 00:51:11.536
Where the real action is.

1071
00:51:11.536 --> 00:51:12.683
- All right.
- Yeah.

1072
00:51:12.683 --> 00:51:14.130
- Just keep your eyes open.

1073
00:51:14.130 --> 00:51:15.489
- Yeah. I wouldn't worry about that.

1074
00:51:15.489 --> 00:51:17.089
- Yeah (laughing). exactly.

1075
00:51:17.089 --> 00:51:17.967
- He's an old timer.
- Old. Don.

1076
00:51:17.967 --> 00:51:18.995
what are you doing in there?

1077
00:51:18.995 --> 00:51:19.972
- [Man] Hey Don. hey Don.

1078
00:51:19.972 --> 00:51:20.917
- Can't answer. is he dying?

1079
00:51:20.917 --> 00:51:22.702
(men laughing)
- I know it.

1080
00:51:22.702 --> 00:51:23.790
- Hey. hey. he probably wants someone

1081
00:51:23.790 --> 00:51:26.529
to come out and kick your ass now.

1082
00:51:26.529 --> 00:51:27.362
- I'm so afraid.

1083
00:51:27.362 --> 00:51:29.266
(men laughing)

1084
00:51:29.266 --> 00:51:30.850
How would he do that?

1085
00:51:30.850 --> 00:51:32.121
Would his back break?

1086
00:51:32.121 --> 00:51:33.740
You need a. you need a hand in there?

1087
00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:34.947
You need some help?

1088
00:51:34.947 --> 00:51:36.645
I got your walker outside if you want one.

1089
00:51:36.645 --> 00:51:39.936
It's (laughing).

1090
00:51:39.936 --> 00:51:42.519
(door squeaks)

1091
00:51:43.368 --> 00:51:45.785
(gun firing)

1092
00:51:48.899 --> 00:51:49.732
- Carmine.

1093
00:51:50.922 --> 00:51:52.505
Oh. please. please.

1094
00:51:53.341 --> 00:51:54.281
- I'm not gonna shoot ya.

1095
00:51:54.281 --> 00:51:55.796
(gun clatters)

1096
00:51:55.796 --> 00:51:57.352
You're not afraid of me. right?

1097
00:51:57.352 --> 00:52:00.597
- Oh. oh. that's just a joke. Carmine.

1098
00:52:00.597 --> 00:52:03.518
- It's a joke. you're (speaks Italian) .

1099
00:52:03.518 --> 00:52:06.685
Yah!
(blood sloshing)

1100
00:52:15.024 --> 00:52:16.504
(flesh squelching)

1101
00:52:16.504 --> 00:52:18.999
(gunshot blasts)

1102
00:52:18.999 --> 00:52:21.416
(gun firing)

1103
00:52:23.344 --> 00:52:26.927
(Carmine breathing loudly)

1104
00:52:27.921 --> 00:52:31.088
(footsteps pattering)

1105
00:52:33.153 --> 00:52:35.003
(tense foreboding music)

1106
00:52:35.003 --> 00:52:37.648
(guns firing)

1107
00:52:37.648 --> 00:52:38.921
- Drop your gun or I'll
blow your brains out.

1108
00:52:38.921 --> 00:52:42.886
(bones crunch)
(gun firing)

1109
00:52:42.886 --> 00:52:47.136
(tense foreboding music continues)

1110
00:52:48.039 --> 00:52:48.986
(door latch clicks)

1111
00:52:48.986 --> 00:52:49.819
- Whoa!

1112
00:52:49.819 --> 00:52:50.739
Where's Joe?

1113
00:52:50.739 --> 00:52:53.114
- He's fine.
- Where is he?

1114
00:52:53.114 --> 00:52:54.114
- Follow me.

1115
00:52:55.259 --> 00:52:56.509
Stay behind me.

1116
00:52:57.766 --> 00:53:00.766
(gunshots blasting)

1117
00:53:06.464 --> 00:53:10.714
(tense foreboding music continues)

1118
00:53:34.344 --> 00:53:35.177
- Oh. shit.

1119
00:53:35.177 --> 00:53:38.012
(gun fires)

1120
00:53:38.012 --> 00:53:40.475
(guns firing)

1121
00:53:40.475 --> 00:53:41.725
- [Man] Gotcha!

1122
00:53:43.832 --> 00:53:45.325
- [Man] Fuck you!

1123
00:53:45.325 --> 00:53:47.742
(gun firing)

1124
00:53:55.132 --> 00:53:56.132
- Saddle up.

1125
00:53:57.366 --> 00:54:00.757
Let's have the vans
running in five minutes.

1126
00:54:00.757 --> 00:54:03.942
and this time don't forget the gloves.

1127
00:54:03.942 --> 00:54:06.144
- You want your piece boss?

1128
00:54:06.144 --> 00:54:08.122
- I always want my piece.

1129
00:54:08.122 --> 00:54:09.626
Let me explain.

1130
00:54:09.626 --> 00:54:12.594
I went on a job with my pops.

1131
00:54:12.594 --> 00:54:15.040
and one of those guineas
were on the floor.

1132
00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:18.138
still alive. killed one of my men.

1133
00:54:18.138 --> 00:54:20.130
So from now on the only thing

1134
00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:24.645
that's gonna be on the
floor is gonna be dead.

1135
00:54:24.645 --> 00:54:25.812
Do ya hear me?

1136
00:54:26.796 --> 00:54:30.271
- Clancy. it seems like we're
getting a lot of work lately.

1137
00:54:30.271 --> 00:54:33.116
- Let me tell you something
about the Molinari family.

1138
00:54:33.116 --> 00:54:35.740
Joe was 16 when he had
taken over the family.

1139
00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:38.481
and his father didn't even know it.

1140
00:54:38.481 --> 00:54:42.257
All's I can tell ya. he's
not a man to be fooled with.

1141
00:54:42.257 --> 00:54:45.360
and the invisible will remain invisible.

1142
00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:48.443
(light Celtic music)

1143
00:55:01.531 --> 00:55:03.184
Guys. you know what to do.

1144
00:55:03.184 --> 00:55:05.033
I don't want no blood in my van.

1145
00:55:05.033 --> 00:55:05.866
(gunshot blasts)

1146
00:55:05.866 --> 00:55:06.699
- [Man] What do you wanna
do with the building

1147
00:55:06.699 --> 00:55:08.676
after we do the bodies. torch it?

1148
00:55:08.676 --> 00:55:09.509
(gunshot blasts)

1149
00:55:09.509 --> 00:55:10.370
All right. guys. well. let's get rid

1150
00:55:10.370 --> 00:55:12.884
of these bodies. come on.

1151
00:55:12.884 --> 00:55:14.603
(gunshot blasts)

1152
00:55:14.603 --> 00:55:18.520
(light Celtic music continues)

1153
00:55:38.017 --> 00:55:40.684
(ominous music)

1154
00:55:51.516 --> 00:55:55.183
(dramatic orchestral music)

1155
00:56:01.859 --> 00:56:03.879
(men speaking Italian)

1156
00:56:03.879 --> 00:56:06.462
(men laughing)

1157
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:11.097
- I hate. I hate flying these things.

1158
00:56:11.097 --> 00:56:11.930
I just hate it.

1159
00:56:11.930 --> 00:56:14.749
- And they're so cheap now.
(utensil clacking)

1160
00:56:14.749 --> 00:56:19.749
(men chattering)
(men speaking Italian)

1161
00:56:20.757 --> 00:56:23.752
- You got your community running it.

1162
00:56:23.752 --> 00:56:27.205
(fork clinking)

1163
00:56:27.205 --> 00:56:28.298
- Can I get your attention for a minute?

1164
00:56:28.298 --> 00:56:30.005
First of all. thank
you all for coming down

1165
00:56:30.005 --> 00:56:32.746
on such short notice to
this emergency meeting.

1166
00:56:32.746 --> 00:56:35.663
but there's a lot that has gone on.

1167
00:56:36.810 --> 00:56:39.527
And unfortunately there's
a lot more to come.

1168
00:56:39.527 --> 00:56:41.187
And I thought that we'd get together

1169
00:56:41.187 --> 00:56:43.209
in this private emergency
meeting and discuss it.

1170
00:56:43.209 --> 00:56:47.287
so you all know what's
happening. because if you don't.

1171
00:56:47.287 --> 00:56:48.620
you might take it the wrong way

1172
00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:50.550
and not understand what we're doing.

1173
00:56:50.550 --> 00:56:52.039
By the time we leave here today.

1174
00:56:52.039 --> 00:56:55.235
I promise you you'll all
know what has happened.

1175
00:56:55.235 --> 00:56:57.970
why it happened. how it happened.

1176
00:56:57.970 --> 00:57:00.200
But most importantly.
you're gonna understand

1177
00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:03.807
and know what's about to happen. okay?

1178
00:57:03.807 --> 00:57:07.396
Which. uh. which is gonna be huge.

1179
00:57:07.396 --> 00:57:09.799
- Before we get into all that.

1180
00:57:09.799 --> 00:57:13.029
I need you to know that we lost

1181
00:57:13.029 --> 00:57:15.279
six of our guys last night.

1182
00:57:16.255 --> 00:57:18.922
Not just my guys. our guys. six.

1183
00:57:21.431 --> 00:57:24.322
And you know how they took 'em out?

1184
00:57:24.322 --> 00:57:27.072
They took 'em out Sicilian style.

1185
00:57:28.410 --> 00:57:32.243
Old school. Sicilian
style. they took 'em out.

1186
00:57:33.441 --> 00:57:35.832
I'm here to tell you that today.

1187
00:57:35.832 --> 00:57:38.666
There's a reason why that happened. right?

1188
00:57:38.666 --> 00:57:40.415
We all know.

1189
00:57:40.415 --> 00:57:42.746
We all know why that's happening.

1190
00:57:42.746 --> 00:57:44.243
It's starting up again.

1191
00:57:44.243 --> 00:57:48.576
It's rolling out (speaks Italian).

1192
00:57:51.549 --> 00:57:55.260
- Listen. (exhales loudly)

1193
00:57:55.260 --> 00:57:57.852
I'm sure you know. like
everyone at this table.

1194
00:57:57.852 --> 00:58:00.154
I'm the last guy that ever wants war.

1195
00:58:00.154 --> 00:58:03.321
If you remember when we had that huge.

1196
00:58:04.836 --> 00:58:08.805
huge blow up. and there was a
big (speaks Italian) member.

1197
00:58:08.805 --> 00:58:11.040
and Vincenzo stalled out on me

1198
00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:14.341
because he wanted to
start whacking everybody.

1199
00:58:14.341 --> 00:58:16.000
I don't like war.

1200
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.053
- I think now's the time
to grow a set of balls.

1201
00:58:19.053 --> 00:58:22.746
We have to strike. and we
can't take this lightly.

1202
00:58:22.746 --> 00:58:24.712
The fact of the matter
is that Carmine and I

1203
00:58:24.712 --> 00:58:27.917
were ready to be executed
a couple of days ago.

1204
00:58:27.917 --> 00:58:29.567
And now we're sitting
here asking ourselves.

1205
00:58:29.567 --> 00:58:31.936
do we want war or we don't want war?

1206
00:58:31.936 --> 00:58:32.769
There's no choice.

1207
00:58:32.769 --> 00:58:34.159
They drew first blood.

1208
00:58:34.159 --> 00:58:36.379
Had it not been for the key intelligence

1209
00:58:36.379 --> 00:58:38.968
that we had outside looking in.

1210
00:58:38.968 --> 00:58:41.222
we would have both been
in the ground by now.

1211
00:58:41.222 --> 00:58:43.176
I'm a hundred percent sure on that.

1212
00:58:43.176 --> 00:58:44.409
- But it's here.

1213
00:58:44.409 --> 00:58:46.254
It's no stopping. all right?

1214
00:58:46.254 --> 00:58:48.216
You lost some guys yesterday.

1215
00:58:48.216 --> 00:58:49.971
We're gonna get some of theirs tomorrow.

1216
00:58:49.971 --> 00:58:52.423
That's the way it always goes.

1217
00:58:52.423 --> 00:58:55.294
The Molinaris. they got something here.

1218
00:58:55.294 --> 00:58:56.723
They got something that's gonna end this

1219
00:58:56.723 --> 00:58:59.130
and end it quick. all right?

1220
00:58:59.130 --> 00:59:00.240
You back in business.

1221
00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:01.610
it's gonna put you back in business.

1222
00:59:01.610 --> 00:59:03.974
and it's gonna put you back in business.

1223
00:59:03.974 --> 00:59:07.816
Don Carmine. why don't you tell
everybody here at the table

1224
00:59:07.816 --> 00:59:10.483
exactly what it is that you saw.

1225
00:59:14.673 --> 00:59:17.665
- If I tell you this.
you're gonna not believe.

1226
00:59:17.665 --> 00:59:18.711
but I'm gonna tell you something.

1227
00:59:18.711 --> 00:59:20.511
first what stays in this room.

1228
00:59:20.511 --> 00:59:22.692
This is about the most important

1229
00:59:22.692 --> 00:59:24.561
and biggest move we ever made.

1230
00:59:24.561 --> 00:59:26.317
and biggest investment.

1231
00:59:26.317 --> 00:59:30.010
I saw on TV a special. years
back. in Japan somewhere

1232
00:59:30.010 --> 00:59:33.665
they were making these
robotic. lifelike figures.

1233
00:59:33.665 --> 00:59:36.190
And I thought. wow. that's pretty cool.

1234
00:59:36.190 --> 00:59:38.202
I said. but you could still tell

1235
00:59:38.202 --> 00:59:40.172
there's something not natural. not real.

1236
00:59:40.172 --> 00:59:44.969
even though they had a
flesh skin and everything.

1237
00:59:44.969 --> 00:59:46.628
You gotta laugh because
Joe has always kept me

1238
00:59:46.628 --> 00:59:49.754
in tune with. with all the technology.

1239
00:59:49.754 --> 00:59:51.725
You know. if you remember
a couple years ago

1240
00:59:51.725 --> 00:59:54.026
we took that route because of him.

1241
00:59:54.026 --> 00:59:55.859
with all the traffic lights and everything

1242
00:59:55.859 --> 00:59:57.292
we were controlling.

1243
00:59:57.292 --> 01:00:01.125
He took it 10. 10 years.
10 light years ahead.

1244
01:00:01.978 --> 01:00:05.061
We've got. for lack of a better word.

1245
01:00:06.345 --> 01:00:07.252
we got robots.

1246
01:00:07.252 --> 01:00:11.681
That's a. that's an insult
to call them robots.

1247
01:00:11.681 --> 01:00:13.764
We've got lifelike. guys.

1248
01:00:15.326 --> 01:00:17.326
- Assassins.
- Assassins.

1249
01:00:18.228 --> 01:00:19.762
One could be sitting at this table.

1250
01:00:19.762 --> 01:00:23.262
and I swear to God. you would never know.

1251
01:00:27.796 --> 01:00:30.354
It's like nothing I've ever seen.

1252
01:00:30.354 --> 01:00:33.775
All I know is when they separated us

1253
01:00:33.775 --> 01:00:37.786
we knew we were two minutes
from gettin' whacked.

1254
01:00:37.786 --> 01:00:41.996
He got out. and one of
these T-Rex. Ty-rod.

1255
01:00:41.996 --> 01:00:44.014
teat. whatever the hell you call 'em.

1256
01:00:44.014 --> 01:00:45.628
appeared out of nowhere.

1257
01:00:45.628 --> 01:00:47.878
Took me. put me behind him.

1258
01:00:48.810 --> 01:00:52.055
And it was like walking
in front of a steel wall.

1259
01:00:52.055 --> 01:00:54.992
He whacked about 50 guys.
right in front of me.

1260
01:00:54.992 --> 01:00:57.535
while blocking me. and taking me

1261
01:00:57.535 --> 01:00:59.493
and escorting me out to meet Joe.

1262
01:00:59.493 --> 01:01:02.410
This is shit I can't believe still.

1263
01:01:03.389 --> 01:01:05.293
I still don't believe what I saw.

1264
01:01:05.293 --> 01:01:09.082
And if you guys see
this. this is the future.

1265
01:01:09.082 --> 01:01:11.165
And with this we will be.

1266
01:01:12.455 --> 01:01:15.171
we'll run the whole gamut for good.

1267
01:01:15.171 --> 01:01:17.491
- This is a cyborg infiltration unit.

1268
01:01:17.491 --> 01:01:19.408
part man. part machine.

1269
01:01:20.519 --> 01:01:24.442
On the inside. it's a
titanium alloy combat chassis.

1270
01:01:24.442 --> 01:01:29.186
microprocessor driven.
very tough. very durable.

1271
01:01:29.186 --> 01:01:33.354
On the inside. it's a living human tissue.

1272
01:01:33.354 --> 01:01:35.743
organically grown in our labs.

1273
01:01:35.743 --> 01:01:38.243
Skin. nails. hair. everything.

1274
01:01:40.151 --> 01:01:43.401
Everything that makes a human. a human.

1275
01:01:46.974 --> 01:01:49.337
- We have Giancarlo Luca here from Sicily

1276
01:01:49.337 --> 01:01:52.095
who's giving us the support from.

1277
01:01:52.095 --> 01:01:54.082
as one of the five family members.

1278
01:01:54.082 --> 01:01:55.626
the heads of the family there in Sicily.

1279
01:01:55.626 --> 01:01:58.103
he's taken upon himself to come here

1280
01:01:58.103 --> 01:02:02.630
on a very dangerous trip to
show his support and loyalty.

1281
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:05.158
And thank you very much for coming.

1282
01:02:05.158 --> 01:02:08.908
(Giancarlo speaking Italian)

1283
01:02:20.479 --> 01:02:22.491
(men speaking Italian)

1284
01:02:22.491 --> 01:02:26.275
- Two years ago. we bought
5.000 acres in Nevada.

1285
01:02:26.275 --> 01:02:29.623
in the middle of the desert. nowhere.

1286
01:02:29.623 --> 01:02:34.339
The Molinari family built a
production facility there.

1287
01:02:34.339 --> 01:02:36.094
They brought in the best scientists.

1288
01:02:36.094 --> 01:02:39.844
the best programmers.
the best metal workers.

1289
01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:45.241
Right now we have 88 of
these units completed

1290
01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:49.347
and ready to unleash upon our enemies.

1291
01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:55.410
Gentlemen. I'd like to turn your attention

1292
01:02:55.410 --> 01:02:59.077
to the monitor and see
for yourself the T25.

1293
01:03:00.967 --> 01:03:02.058
(suspenseful music)
If you turn your attention

1294
01:03:02.058 --> 01:03:05.418
to the monitor. you're
gonna see the production.

1295
01:03:05.418 --> 01:03:08.800
There it is as we're loading
in trucks of titanium.

1296
01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:10.306
Here are the scientists.

1297
01:03:10.306 --> 01:03:12.037
They're inspecting it.

1298
01:03:12.037 --> 01:03:15.808
Every scientist has been
vetted by the Molinari people.

1299
01:03:15.808 --> 01:03:17.893
They're not allowed to leave the facility.

1300
01:03:17.893 --> 01:03:20.402
In fact. once they're done here.

1301
01:03:20.402 --> 01:03:22.706
we haven't even decided what
we're gonna do with 'em.

1302
01:03:22.706 --> 01:03:24.899
Here they are coming off the line.

1303
01:03:24.899 --> 01:03:28.525
You can see the programmers
inspecting their microprocessor.

1304
01:03:28.525 --> 01:03:32.658
Gentlemen. what we've
developed is beyond anything

1305
01:03:32.658 --> 01:03:35.039
that you have seen on this planet.

1306
01:03:35.039 --> 01:03:39.525
These are the most
efficient killing machines

1307
01:03:39.525 --> 01:03:41.915
that has ever been developed.

1308
01:03:41.915 --> 01:03:44.383
Nothing kills more efficiently.

1309
01:03:44.383 --> 01:03:47.085
Nothing kills more cleanly.

1310
01:03:47.085 --> 01:03:50.502
and is completely untraceable back to us.

1311
01:03:55.391 --> 01:03:58.641
(man speaking Italian)

1312
01:05:12.690 --> 01:05:14.166
(men speaking Italian)

1313
01:05:14.166 --> 01:05:16.921
- And to add to that. I didn't come here

1314
01:05:16.921 --> 01:05:19.561
just to have some pasta and some cheese.

1315
01:05:19.561 --> 01:05:21.873
some imported cheeses and wine.

1316
01:05:21.873 --> 01:05:24.706
I came back as a favor to Don Joe.

1317
01:05:28.059 --> 01:05:31.115
But if you remember what I said

1318
01:05:31.115 --> 01:05:33.760
before this whole thing started.

1319
01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:35.337
that we should have
taken care of the problem

1320
01:05:35.337 --> 01:05:37.972
in Italy a long time ago.

1321
01:05:37.972 --> 01:05:41.639
So now I vow to make
sure I will promise you

1322
01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:46.913
I will go back there and
take care of this problem.

1323
01:05:46.913 --> 01:05:50.296
make sure it's carried out to a T.

1324
01:05:50.296 --> 01:05:51.129
Agreed?

1325
01:05:52.835 --> 01:05:55.668
- I heard on the streets in Italy.

1326
01:05:56.715 --> 01:06:00.093
a whole group of guys killed the Don.

1327
01:06:00.093 --> 01:06:02.088
- That was no group of guys.

1328
01:06:02.088 --> 01:06:04.338
That was one T25 in action.

1329
01:06:05.498 --> 01:06:06.998
- Salute.
- Salute.

1330
01:06:13.714 --> 01:06:15.779
- Before we adjourn gentlemen.

1331
01:06:15.779 --> 01:06:16.736
I just wanna remind everybody

1332
01:06:16.736 --> 01:06:19.236
about Don Carmine's directive.

1333
01:06:20.566 --> 01:06:23.149
What you hear here. stays here.

1334
01:06:27.322 --> 01:06:28.526
(gunshot blasts)

1335
01:06:28.526 --> 01:06:30.919
(men shouting in Italian)

1336
01:06:30.919 --> 01:06:32.516
- Hey. what's the matter with you?

1337
01:06:32.516 --> 01:06:34.550
- Sit down. sit down.
- Easy. guys.

1338
01:06:34.550 --> 01:06:36.800
That's a T25. that's a T25.

1339
01:06:38.038 --> 01:06:39.217
- It's a roboto?

1340
01:06:39.217 --> 01:06:42.050
- T25. state your prime directive.

1341
01:06:43.193 --> 01:06:47.337
- To serve and protect the
Molinari family at all costs.

1342
01:06:47.337 --> 01:06:49.653
- We did tell you that
one could be sitting

1343
01:06:49.653 --> 01:06:51.489
right amongst us. you would never know it.

1344
01:06:51.489 --> 01:06:56.014
This is incredible
technology we got a hold of.

1345
01:06:56.014 --> 01:06:57.710
We knew he was a traitor.

1346
01:06:57.710 --> 01:07:00.412
and we knew he was leaking
family secrets out.

1347
01:07:00.412 --> 01:07:02.321
and we knew he had to go.

1348
01:07:02.321 --> 01:07:03.929
With the help of this technology.

1349
01:07:03.929 --> 01:07:07.467
this is how swift we can respond and act.

1350
01:07:07.467 --> 01:07:08.779
All you guys are safe.

1351
01:07:08.779 --> 01:07:10.752
All you guys are in good standing with us.

1352
01:07:10.752 --> 01:07:12.744
You have nothing to worry about.

1353
01:07:12.744 --> 01:07:14.328
And we're gonna get
together again very soon

1354
01:07:14.328 --> 01:07:16.637
and talk about the next steps.

1355
01:07:16.637 --> 01:07:19.294
- It's time to tie up the
loose ends. gentlemen.

1356
01:07:19.294 --> 01:07:21.300
He was a key focus leaking. uh.

1357
01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:24.716
intelligent information
back over to Sicily.

1358
01:07:24.716 --> 01:07:26.801
We found out about it months ago.

1359
01:07:26.801 --> 01:07:28.351
and we just decided to play the game.

1360
01:07:28.351 --> 01:07:30.569
but we're glad to see
you had an opportunity

1361
01:07:30.569 --> 01:07:32.543
to see what the T25 can do.

1362
01:07:32.543 --> 01:07:33.908
- What is that thing again?

1363
01:07:33.908 --> 01:07:34.741
- The T25.

1364
01:07:37.115 --> 01:07:38.736
- Here's business with you.

1365
01:07:38.736 --> 01:07:40.019
- [All] Salute.

1366
01:07:40.019 --> 01:07:41.982
- Salute. gentlemen.

1367
01:07:41.982 --> 01:07:44.649
(phone ringing)

1368
01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:50.427
- [Operator] Your call
is being transferred.

1369
01:07:50.427 --> 01:07:55.427
(dramatic whooshing)
(phone ringing)

1370
01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:59.464
- Now listen to me and
listen to me clearly.

1371
01:07:59.464 --> 01:08:01.499
You get on the next plane.

1372
01:08:01.499 --> 01:08:04.989
and I want you to kill Joe's sister.

1373
01:08:04.989 --> 01:08:07.920
and whoever she's with. everybody.

1374
01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:09.837
You take everybody out.

1375
01:08:11.165 --> 01:08:13.933
I'm gonna send a message to this guy.

1376
01:08:13.933 --> 01:08:16.916
a clear message to this guy.

1377
01:08:16.916 --> 01:08:18.259
You got me?

1378
01:08:18.259 --> 01:08:20.365
And then you get back to me.

1379
01:08:20.365 --> 01:08:23.032
I wanna let 'em know that Sicily

1380
01:08:24.259 --> 01:08:25.592
owns his family.

1381
01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:29.392
and that this has just been

1382
01:08:29.392 --> 01:08:31.892
a temporary situation for him.

1383
01:08:32.816 --> 01:08:36.483
(gentle Italian folk music)

1384
01:08:45.094 --> 01:08:48.710
(man speaking Italian)

1385
01:08:48.710 --> 01:08:49.833
(woman speaking Italian)

1386
01:08:49.833 --> 01:08:51.845
(man speaking Italian)

1387
01:08:51.845 --> 01:08:52.679
(woman speaking Italian)

1388
01:08:52.679 --> 01:08:56.260
(man speaking Italian)

1389
01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:58.107
(woman laughs)

1390
01:08:58.107 --> 01:08:58.940
- Is that why you waited

1391
01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:00.506
so long to ask me out to dinner?

1392
01:09:00.506 --> 01:09:02.362
(both laughing)

1393
01:09:02.362 --> 01:09:04.231
You know. he's overproductive.

1394
01:09:04.231 --> 01:09:08.398
but I think he'd be very
happy with this decision.

1395
01:09:10.259 --> 01:09:14.229
If you look at my past and
the men I've dated before.

1396
01:09:14.229 --> 01:09:16.063
you're perfect for me.

1397
01:09:16.942 --> 01:09:18.708
How could he argue with that?

1398
01:09:18.708 --> 01:09:22.718
(man speaking Italian)

1399
01:09:22.718 --> 01:09:27.718
- (laughs) I love the
way you talk (laughs).

1400
01:09:28.255 --> 01:09:30.612
(man speaking Italian)

1401
01:09:30.612 --> 01:09:31.886
(woman speaking Italian)

1402
01:09:31.886 --> 01:09:35.136
(man speaking Italian)

1403
01:09:36.931 --> 01:09:39.102
- Oh.
- Huh (laughs).

1404
01:09:39.102 --> 01:09:42.519
(woman speaking Italian)

1405
01:09:44.545 --> 01:09:47.211
(ominous music)

1406
01:09:56.749 --> 01:09:59.731
(man speaking Italian)

1407
01:09:59.731 --> 01:10:04.731
(guns firing)
(woman screaming)

1408
01:10:10.062 --> 01:10:13.062
(suspenseful music)

1409
01:10:20.809 --> 01:10:21.977
- All right.

1410
01:10:21.977 --> 01:10:23.577
We're the first people that get called

1411
01:10:23.577 --> 01:10:25.118
for something like this.

1412
01:10:25.118 --> 01:10:27.603
This is a family business.

1413
01:10:27.603 --> 01:10:29.905
We set a scene that we can control.

1414
01:10:29.905 --> 01:10:31.764
That's the key.

1415
01:10:31.764 --> 01:10:33.451
We don't like questions.

1416
01:10:33.451 --> 01:10:35.219
Right now there are 15
of us involved in this.

1417
01:10:35.219 --> 01:10:36.052
Do you see what your

1418
01:10:36.052 --> 01:10:36.885
uncle has?
- Yeah.

1419
01:10:36.885 --> 01:10:38.148
- You see what this family has?

1420
01:10:38.148 --> 01:10:40.486
The FBI didn't do shit. okay?

1421
01:10:40.486 --> 01:10:42.877
You get $80.000 and a pension.

1422
01:10:42.877 --> 01:10:44.652
Maybe you can live somewhere in Florida

1423
01:10:44.652 --> 01:10:47.273
with a bunch of old people when you're 80.

1424
01:10:47.273 --> 01:10:49.340
You want money now. though. okay?

1425
01:10:49.340 --> 01:10:52.207
To get money now. you do
what we're doing here.

1426
01:10:52.207 --> 01:10:55.374
As I said. 15 of us. you're number 16.

1427
01:10:56.834 --> 01:10:59.378
We don't need a 16th.

1428
01:10:59.378 --> 01:11:01.573
Love you like an uncle.

1429
01:11:01.573 --> 01:11:04.767
but I'll bury you like a corpse.

1430
01:11:04.767 --> 01:11:06.135
Keep your mouth shut.

1431
01:11:06.135 --> 01:11:08.054
you continue getting paid.

1432
01:11:08.054 --> 01:11:11.831
- And this just works
out smooth every time.

1433
01:11:11.831 --> 01:11:13.975
- Well. that's why they call me. Travis.

1434
01:11:13.975 --> 01:11:17.275
I'm Mr. a hundred. a hundred percent.

1435
01:11:17.275 --> 01:11:19.025
no mistakes. all A's.

1436
01:11:20.619 --> 01:11:24.498
And also those who call
us. they're invisible.

1437
01:11:24.498 --> 01:11:26.915
The invisible stay invisible.

1438
01:11:28.889 --> 01:11:30.438
We don't talk about 'em.

1439
01:11:30.438 --> 01:11:31.889
We don't see 'em.

1440
01:11:31.889 --> 01:11:34.557
(ominous music)

1441
01:11:36.678 --> 01:11:37.993
(door whooshing)

1442
01:11:37.993 --> 01:11:39.788
All right. Travis. let's
see what we got here.

1443
01:11:39.788 --> 01:11:40.936
(camera clicks)

1444
01:11:40.936 --> 01:11:42.484
Oh. yeah.

1445
01:11:42.484 --> 01:11:43.710
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

1446
01:11:43.710 --> 01:11:47.032
This is definitely a situation.

1447
01:11:47.032 --> 01:11:49.339
Uh. Joanne. fill me in.

1448
01:11:49.339 --> 01:11:52.575
- All right. we got
crime family scene here.

1449
01:11:52.575 --> 01:11:54.198
- Uh. no shit.

1450
01:11:54.198 --> 01:11:56.803
- We got Salvatore Pastore.

1451
01:11:56.803 --> 01:11:58.987
We sent him off to the hospital.

1452
01:11:58.987 --> 01:12:01.904
- Uh-huh.
- We got five shots here.

1453
01:12:03.570 --> 01:12:05.121
Unknown. we don't know who that is.

1454
01:12:05.121 --> 01:12:06.217
- [John] All right. don't
worry about it. uh-huh.

1455
01:12:06.217 --> 01:12:08.318
- [Joanne] We got two
civilians over there.

1456
01:12:08.318 --> 01:12:09.151
- Yeah.

1457
01:12:10.173 --> 01:12:14.005
Okay. so we got three
shots. uh. this unknown.

1458
01:12:14.963 --> 01:12:18.112
couple of very unfortunate
bystanders right there.

1459
01:12:18.112 --> 01:12:19.577
Uh. all right. this is what we're gonna.

1460
01:12:19.577 --> 01:12:21.434
oh. and a crap meal on the table.

1461
01:12:21.434 --> 01:12:23.434
Um. all right. area that

1462
01:12:25.492 --> 01:12:26.814
nobody's gonna worry about.

1463
01:12:26.814 --> 01:12:28.717
We wanna keep this all on the down low.

1464
01:12:28.717 --> 01:12:30.385
Herb will take care of ourselves.

1465
01:12:30.385 --> 01:12:31.951
- [Joanne] What are you talking about?

1466
01:12:31.951 --> 01:12:34.701
- Okay. questions cause problems.

1467
01:12:35.674 --> 01:12:37.591
Silence gets paid. shh.

1468
01:12:39.898 --> 01:12:41.111
We'll handle her.

1469
01:12:41.111 --> 01:12:42.447
We know what we're doing over here.

1470
01:12:42.447 --> 01:12:45.773
You want to do things
that help us. Joanne.

1471
01:12:45.773 --> 01:12:48.909
and also not ask questions and talk back.

1472
01:12:48.909 --> 01:12:51.136
'Cause you know. when you talk back

1473
01:12:51.136 --> 01:12:53.456
you start shoveling dog shit for a living.

1474
01:12:53.456 --> 01:12:55.125
and you don't wanna be doing that.

1475
01:12:55.125 --> 01:12:57.308
You wanna keep collecting those paychecks

1476
01:12:57.308 --> 01:12:58.993
so you can get your hair did.

1477
01:12:58.993 --> 01:13:00.487
You feel me?

1478
01:13:00.487 --> 01:13:05.154
Um. these guys. uh. these are
definitely. you know what?

1479
01:13:06.076 --> 01:13:07.193
God bless.

1480
01:13:07.193 --> 01:13:08.526
God bless.

1481
01:13:08.526 --> 01:13:10.222
Unfortunate situation over here.

1482
01:13:10.222 --> 01:13:12.925
This is a very unfortunate situation.

1483
01:13:12.925 --> 01:13:16.639
These were innocent
bystanders who unfortunately

1484
01:13:16.639 --> 01:13:19.659
came upon a terrible
situation and got shot.

1485
01:13:19.659 --> 01:13:21.286
Uh. I want the jewels off there.

1486
01:13:21.286 --> 01:13:24.087
I want any money taken out of there.

1487
01:13:24.087 --> 01:13:26.587
That was a robbery gone wrong.

1488
01:13:27.514 --> 01:13:30.920
Unfortunate situation for
this wonderful establishment.

1489
01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:34.773
Um. everything else we've pretty
much got covered over here.

1490
01:13:34.773 --> 01:13:37.523
You guys. uh. three monkeys.

1491
01:13:37.523 --> 01:13:39.571
hear no evil. see no evil. speak no evil.

1492
01:13:39.571 --> 01:13:42.254
Pretend you're all Helen
Keller. dumb. deaf. and blind.

1493
01:13:42.254 --> 01:13:44.754
Nothing goes beyond this room.

1494
01:13:46.591 --> 01:13:48.255
Nothing happened.

1495
01:13:48.255 --> 01:13:52.978
No cell phones. no footage
here in this restaurant.

1496
01:13:52.978 --> 01:13:55.242
We're gonna take care
of all of this situation

1497
01:13:55.242 --> 01:13:57.978
on the down low so that we don't get

1498
01:13:57.978 --> 01:14:00.208
uninterested parties involved.

1499
01:14:00.208 --> 01:14:01.348
All good?

1500
01:14:01.348 --> 01:14:03.014
Nobody saw anything.

1501
01:14:03.014 --> 01:14:04.079
I want all. uh.
(camera clicks)

1502
01:14:04.079 --> 01:14:07.076
surveillance footage. cell phone footage.

1503
01:14:07.076 --> 01:14:10.559
anything that you think might've made it

1504
01:14:10.559 --> 01:14:12.531
look like this actually happened.

1505
01:14:12.531 --> 01:14:16.798
(camera clicks)
gone. wiped clean.

1506
01:14:16.798 --> 01:14:19.880
(footsteps clacking)

1507
01:14:35.773 --> 01:14:38.691
(foreboding music)

1508
01:15:26.014 --> 01:15:27.191
- Franco.

1509
01:15:27.191 --> 01:15:30.691
(Franco speaking Italian)

1510
01:15:34.721 --> 01:15:35.971
- Wait outside.

1511
01:15:40.407 --> 01:15:44.241
Look what they've done
to my beautiful sister.

1512
01:15:47.594 --> 01:15:48.583
You're gonna take her body.

1513
01:15:48.583 --> 01:15:51.279
and you're gonna fly it out
to the Las Vegas facility.

1514
01:15:51.279 --> 01:15:52.853
Immediately.

1515
01:15:52.853 --> 01:15:54.272
- Las Vegas?

1516
01:15:54.272 --> 01:15:56.522
Don't you mean in New York?

1517
01:15:57.815 --> 01:15:58.648
- Las Vegas.

1518
01:15:58.648 --> 01:15:59.888
You're flying her body out.

1519
01:15:59.888 --> 01:16:01.687
You're taking it tonight.

1520
01:16:01.687 --> 01:16:03.055
You're gonna call Giancarlo.

1521
01:16:03.055 --> 01:16:06.320
and inform him of my instructions.

1522
01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:07.802
Her body is not to go any place else

1523
01:16:07.802 --> 01:16:09.137
but that facility right now.

1524
01:16:09.137 --> 01:16:12.242
Get the plane ready and take care of it.

1525
01:16:12.242 --> 01:16:15.909
- It's time she should
have a normal burial.

1526
01:16:17.139 --> 01:16:19.557
- There is no normal. Franco!

1527
01:16:21.835 --> 01:16:24.937
Us. this. nothing we do is normal.

1528
01:16:24.937 --> 01:16:26.666
The day you walked into that room

1529
01:16:26.666 --> 01:16:28.143
and you were part of the family.

1530
01:16:28.143 --> 01:16:31.143
normal was completely off the table.

1531
01:16:33.007 --> 01:16:34.608
This is fuckin' war.

1532
01:16:34.608 --> 01:16:37.213
and everybody responsible
for this will die.

1533
01:16:37.213 --> 01:16:40.213
I will even go after their children.

1534
01:16:41.123 --> 01:16:42.458
This is enough. it ends tonight.

1535
01:16:42.458 --> 01:16:44.094
Everybody will be completely.

1536
01:16:44.094 --> 01:16:46.761
completely fuckin' dead tonight.

1537
01:16:47.987 --> 01:16:49.329
Take her body.

1538
01:16:49.329 --> 01:16:51.168
It goes to Las Vegas tonight.

1539
01:16:51.168 --> 01:16:54.418
(footsteps clattering)

1540
01:16:55.811 --> 01:16:58.894
(gentle Asian music)

1541
01:17:04.832 --> 01:17:06.617
- Hey. Chin.

1542
01:17:06.617 --> 01:17:09.001
- You got some balls
coming up in here. man.

1543
01:17:09.001 --> 01:17:11.360
What bringing you over here?

1544
01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:12.811
- Listen. take it easy.

1545
01:17:12.811 --> 01:17:15.022
Let me speak before you get all crazy.

1546
01:17:15.022 --> 01:17:16.431
What happened in Chinatown.

1547
01:17:16.431 --> 01:17:18.303
that's water under the bridge.

1548
01:17:18.303 --> 01:17:19.541
It wasn't personal.

1549
01:17:19.541 --> 01:17:21.885
It was strictly business.
- All right.

1550
01:17:21.885 --> 01:17:23.291
- It had nothin' to do with me.

1551
01:17:23.291 --> 01:17:25.303
I'm here to talk to you about something

1552
01:17:25.303 --> 01:17:26.760
I need you to do for me.

1553
01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:28.280
and I'll make it worth your while.

1554
01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:30.620
Are you interested?

1555
01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:31.936
- I'm listening.

1556
01:17:31.936 --> 01:17:34.805
- I need Joe out of the picture.

1557
01:17:34.805 --> 01:17:35.805
- Joe.
- Joe.

1558
01:17:36.824 --> 01:17:38.240
Joe. don't worry about Carmine.

1559
01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:39.351
Forget about fuckin' Carmine. he's old.

1560
01:17:39.351 --> 01:17:41.668
- Joe and Carmines are together.

1561
01:17:41.668 --> 01:17:43.443
You understand what you asking me to do?

1562
01:17:43.443 --> 01:17:46.795
- Yeah. I'm asking you to take out Joe.

1563
01:17:46.795 --> 01:17:48.543
I need you to bring
him here on a Saturday.

1564
01:17:48.543 --> 01:17:49.585
I'm gonna handle it.

1565
01:17:49.585 --> 01:17:53.045
I know you guys meet the
third Saturday of every month.

1566
01:17:53.045 --> 01:17:54.849
I need you to bring him here for me.

1567
01:17:54.849 --> 01:17:56.469
and I'll take it from there.

1568
01:17:56.469 --> 01:17:57.829
What do you think?

1569
01:17:57.829 --> 01:17:59.350
- Why should I trust you?

1570
01:17:59.350 --> 01:18:02.232
- I will give you more power
on the east and west side.

1571
01:18:02.232 --> 01:18:04.110
You and your brother
will have so much money.

1572
01:18:04.110 --> 01:18:05.445
you won't even know what to do with it.

1573
01:18:05.445 --> 01:18:06.659
but I need Joe gone.

1574
01:18:06.659 --> 01:18:07.978
Don't worry about Carmine.

1575
01:18:07.978 --> 01:18:10.871
Carmine is old. I can handle him.

1576
01:18:10.871 --> 01:18:13.189
What happened in Chinatown
had nothing to do with me.

1577
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:14.768
It's water under the bridge.

1578
01:18:14.768 --> 01:18:15.687
It wasn't personal.

1579
01:18:15.687 --> 01:18:17.706
It was just business.

1580
01:18:17.706 --> 01:18:20.143
And know also. it was a
guy from my social club

1581
01:18:20.143 --> 01:18:22.773
that I never even knew
what is was gonna happen.

1582
01:18:22.773 --> 01:18:24.153
Otherwise. I woulda stopped it.

1583
01:18:24.153 --> 01:18:26.340
You him in here. and I'll
take care of the rest.

1584
01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:29.434
That's all I need you
to do. and we're good.

1585
01:18:29.434 --> 01:18:30.267
- Okay.

1586
01:18:31.191 --> 01:18:34.332
We could work something out.

1587
01:18:34.332 --> 01:18:35.986
All right.
(hands clap)

1588
01:18:35.986 --> 01:18:36.931
- Deal.
- Deal.

1589
01:18:36.931 --> 01:18:38.696
(ominous music)

1590
01:18:38.696 --> 01:18:41.862
(footsteps crunching)

1591
01:18:52.277 --> 01:18:54.860
(gentle music)

1592
01:18:57.380 --> 01:19:00.231
- Carmine. we have a bit of
an issue here in Chinatown.

1593
01:19:00.231 --> 01:19:02.349
Frank Chin was recently approached

1594
01:19:02.349 --> 01:19:03.905
by one of our family members.

1595
01:19:03.905 --> 01:19:06.061
Um. and. uh. Frank. why don't you tell us

1596
01:19:06.061 --> 01:19:07.650
exactly what happened. please?

1597
01:19:07.650 --> 01:19:09.898
Thank you for coming down. by the way.

1598
01:19:09.898 --> 01:19:11.665
- Your guy. Vincenzo.

1599
01:19:11.665 --> 01:19:13.395
- [Carmine] Yeah. him again.

1600
01:19:13.395 --> 01:19:14.562
- Approach me.

1601
01:19:15.445 --> 01:19:18.087
He wanted both of you dead.

1602
01:19:18.087 --> 01:19:19.303
- When was this?

1603
01:19:19.303 --> 01:19:20.612
- [Frank] Yesterday.

1604
01:19:20.612 --> 01:19:21.945
- What'd he say?

1605
01:19:21.945 --> 01:19:25.379
- I told him the next
meeting we have this month.

1606
01:19:25.379 --> 01:19:26.796
I'll get it done.

1607
01:19:27.638 --> 01:19:31.160
- [Carmine] Was anybody else
there when he said this to you?

1608
01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:33.077
- No.
- Okay. go ahead.

1609
01:19:34.111 --> 01:19:37.498
- Since every month we
meet at the warehouse.

1610
01:19:37.498 --> 01:19:40.255
I told him that that would be a good spot

1611
01:19:40.255 --> 01:19:41.927
for it to go down.

1612
01:19:41.927 --> 01:19:43.318
- I thought he would
have had the sense enough

1613
01:19:43.318 --> 01:19:45.028
to stay low. but obviously not. so.

1614
01:19:45.028 --> 01:19:47.584
- I. I. I knew he was too hot-headed.

1615
01:19:47.584 --> 01:19:49.420
You know. some guys gotta
follow their own destiny.

1616
01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:50.816
This guy wants to die.

1617
01:19:50.816 --> 01:19:53.233
It's sad. but something you can't.

1618
01:19:53.233 --> 01:19:55.281
you can't save guys like him.

1619
01:19:55.281 --> 01:19:57.521
It's. they gotta fulfill
their own destiny.

1620
01:19:57.521 --> 01:20:00.023
He wants to die. this
guy. so we'll help him.

1621
01:20:00.023 --> 01:20:01.611
- That's right.

1622
01:20:01.611 --> 01:20:03.395
Due to the good history
that we have together.

1623
01:20:03.395 --> 01:20:05.748
that's why I brought this
matter up to you guys.

1624
01:20:05.748 --> 01:20:09.391
You know. because this guy.
Vincenzo. it's no good.

1625
01:20:09.391 --> 01:20:10.824
It's causing trouble in the neighborhood.

1626
01:20:10.824 --> 01:20:12.707
it's causing trouble for my business.

1627
01:20:12.707 --> 01:20:14.465
and I just see it's
definitely causing trouble

1628
01:20:14.465 --> 01:20:16.150
for you guys as well.

1629
01:20:16.150 --> 01:20:19.980
So if taking him out is the best thing.

1630
01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:21.309
then let's do it.

1631
01:20:21.309 --> 01:20:23.668
- We'll have our team in
place to take care of it

1632
01:20:23.668 --> 01:20:25.621
from start to finish.

1633
01:20:25.621 --> 01:20:27.428
This way you won't have to get involved

1634
01:20:27.428 --> 01:20:28.315
in anything like that.

1635
01:20:28.315 --> 01:20:29.505
It's best that you don't.

1636
01:20:29.505 --> 01:20:30.579
We've been having some problems

1637
01:20:30.579 --> 01:20:32.755
with some of our affiliates overseas.

1638
01:20:32.755 --> 01:20:34.496
uh. with some other business matters.

1639
01:20:34.496 --> 01:20:37.097
and it really should come from our people.

1640
01:20:37.097 --> 01:20:38.352
- Absolutely.

1641
01:20:38.352 --> 01:20:40.460
This will go a long way
for you. believe me.

1642
01:20:40.460 --> 01:20:41.965
I appreciate you coming in.

1643
01:20:41.965 --> 01:20:44.805
- All right.
- You did the right thing.

1644
01:20:44.805 --> 01:20:45.884
- Thank you. guys.

1645
01:20:45.884 --> 01:20:47.255
- Thank you.
- All right.

1646
01:20:47.255 --> 01:20:50.244
(door latch clicks)

1647
01:20:50.244 --> 01:20:51.477
- Carmine. why don't we do this?

1648
01:20:51.477 --> 01:20:53.966
I'll send the T25s in there.

1649
01:20:53.966 --> 01:20:55.764
It'll be clean. it'll be fast.

1650
01:20:55.764 --> 01:20:57.094
- Okay.
- And we'll get it done

1651
01:20:57.094 --> 01:20:58.603
once and for all.

1652
01:20:58.603 --> 01:20:59.437
He's a problem.

1653
01:20:59.437 --> 01:21:00.270
he's gotta go.
- It's long overdue.

1654
01:21:00.270 --> 01:21:01.295
He's got to go stirring up shit

1655
01:21:01.295 --> 01:21:02.625
for how many years. you know.

1656
01:21:02.625 --> 01:21:04.228
- Now I will tell you.

1657
01:21:04.228 --> 01:21:07.577
he's probably been
talking to Italy as well.

1658
01:21:07.577 --> 01:21:08.871
I don't believe for a second

1659
01:21:08.871 --> 01:21:10.152
that he's been around a while.

1660
01:21:10.152 --> 01:21:11.398
he's got the connections over there.

1661
01:21:11.398 --> 01:21:12.924
they might listen to him.

1662
01:21:12.924 --> 01:21:15.168
But I. I think we gotta
go forward with this.

1663
01:21:15.168 --> 01:21:17.291
- Yeah. that's why we're
getting in the way with them.

1664
01:21:17.291 --> 01:21:19.023
We're getting bad blood over there.

1665
01:21:19.023 --> 01:21:20.655
Had to be somebody leaking to them

1666
01:21:20.655 --> 01:21:24.554
and also feeding them
the wrong kind of info.

1667
01:21:24.554 --> 01:21:25.684
- Well. we have to be careful. too.

1668
01:21:25.684 --> 01:21:27.389
because he does control all of Brooklyn.

1669
01:21:27.389 --> 01:21:29.446
and they're very loyal to him. so.

1670
01:21:29.446 --> 01:21:31.214
Uh. we have to make
sure if we take him out.

1671
01:21:31.214 --> 01:21:32.369
we take everybody out.

1672
01:21:32.369 --> 01:21:34.036
- Yeah. let's do it.

1673
01:21:35.083 --> 01:21:37.160
I wanted to do it. you know. a year ago.

1674
01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:38.766
We gotta do what we gotta do.

1675
01:21:38.766 --> 01:21:40.671
- Okay. so consider it done.

1676
01:21:40.671 --> 01:21:41.648
- Good.
- We'll organize everything

1677
01:21:41.648 --> 01:21:43.577
this Saturday. and it'll happen.

1678
01:21:43.577 --> 01:21:44.610
- Good.
- Okay.

1679
01:21:44.610 --> 01:21:46.853
- [Carmine] Let's do it.

1680
01:21:46.853 --> 01:21:50.353
(gentle electronic music)

1681
01:21:54.746 --> 01:21:57.996
(gentle pensive music)

1682
01:22:04.858 --> 01:22:06.907
- [Joe] Why are you up so late?

1683
01:22:06.907 --> 01:22:10.494
- Yes. I wanted to talk
to you about your sister.

1684
01:22:10.494 --> 01:22:12.161
- What'd she do now?

1685
01:22:13.330 --> 01:22:14.898
- She seems to be off.

1686
01:22:14.898 --> 01:22:18.811
I seen her today and she
didn't acknowledge me at all.

1687
01:22:18.811 --> 01:22:20.061
That's not her.

1688
01:22:21.929 --> 01:22:23.346
- Okay. well. uh.

1689
01:22:25.414 --> 01:22:26.746
look. it's Tina.

1690
01:22:29.726 --> 01:22:32.557
She probably woke up in one of her moods.

1691
01:22:32.557 --> 01:22:34.599
drank too much.

1692
01:22:34.599 --> 01:22:36.766
I wouldn't worry about it.

1693
01:22:38.645 --> 01:22:40.794
- I wanna know what's wrong with her.

1694
01:22:40.794 --> 01:22:42.610
I wanna know why she's
always in the wine room

1695
01:22:42.610 --> 01:22:44.443
all day and all night.

1696
01:22:45.557 --> 01:22:47.989
- I don't know. did you. did you ask her?

1697
01:22:47.989 --> 01:22:51.332
- I didn't ask her that. but
I did ask how she was doing.

1698
01:22:51.332 --> 01:22:53.962
and she gave me a very brief

1699
01:22:53.962 --> 01:22:55.682
response answer back.

1700
01:22:55.682 --> 01:22:56.778
and that's not her.

1701
01:22:56.778 --> 01:22:59.695
And her face. her face was so pale.

1702
01:23:00.626 --> 01:23:02.959
She was very cold and quiet.

1703
01:23:04.138 --> 01:23:05.349
She moved away.

1704
01:23:05.349 --> 01:23:06.332
She didn't answer me back.

1705
01:23:06.332 --> 01:23:08.499
- Look. Lauren. it's late.

1706
01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:11.099
You had a long day.

1707
01:23:11.099 --> 01:23:15.103
Do yourself a favor and just go to bed.

1708
01:23:15.103 --> 01:23:19.000
- I'm asking because I
care about your sister.

1709
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.579
I wanna know what's going on.

1710
01:23:20.579 --> 01:23:21.885
And I wanna know if you
were doing something

1711
01:23:21.885 --> 01:23:25.031
that I think that you
shouldn't be doing at all.

1712
01:23:25.031 --> 01:23:27.248
I didn't think you would have it in you.

1713
01:23:27.248 --> 01:23:30.758
- What would I be doing with my sister?

1714
01:23:30.758 --> 01:23:32.545
- She looks different.

1715
01:23:32.545 --> 01:23:34.146
It's not her.

1716
01:23:34.146 --> 01:23:36.648
That's why I'm here asking you.

1717
01:23:36.648 --> 01:23:40.148
- Look. you shouldn't try to ask questions

1718
01:23:42.182 --> 01:23:43.923
if it's going to be a burden to you

1719
01:23:43.923 --> 01:23:46.231
if you get the answer.

1720
01:23:46.231 --> 01:23:47.981
so go back up to bed.

1721
01:23:48.992 --> 01:23:51.803
She's fine. she'll be fine.

1722
01:23:51.803 --> 01:23:53.641
She's in one of her moods.

1723
01:23:53.641 --> 01:23:55.389
(gentle music)

1724
01:23:55.389 --> 01:24:00.057
And just forget you ever had
that conversation with her.

1725
01:24:02.038 --> 01:24:05.038
(suspenseful music)

1726
01:24:15.144 --> 01:24:17.894
(door squeaking)

1727
01:24:27.786 --> 01:24:30.962
(cell phone chiming)

1728
01:24:30.962 --> 01:24:31.795
- Yo.

1729
01:24:32.744 --> 01:24:34.416
- Yeah. you know. the box arrived.

1730
01:24:34.416 --> 01:24:35.298
- You sure?

1731
01:24:35.298 --> 01:24:36.700
- I'm positive. I go in myself

1732
01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:38.788
and whack these fuckin'
guys with the shells.

1733
01:24:38.788 --> 01:24:41.816
- No. no. listen. stay the
fuck where you are. all right?

1734
01:24:41.816 --> 01:24:43.153
You wait till you see me.

1735
01:24:43.153 --> 01:24:45.017
I want this to be fuckin' painful.

1736
01:24:45.017 --> 01:24:46.482
I don't think you understand.

1737
01:24:46.482 --> 01:24:48.790
Just stay where you are.

1738
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:50.585
- All right. don't wait
for me (indistinct).

1739
01:24:50.585 --> 01:24:51.419
- Okay.

1740
01:25:09.525 --> 01:25:11.942
- Go to this door right here.

1741
01:25:17.076 --> 01:25:20.076
(door latch clicks)

1742
01:25:25.124 --> 01:25:27.541
(door thuds)

1743
01:25:29.489 --> 01:25:31.702
- Anth. let's go.

1744
01:25:31.702 --> 01:25:34.285
(gun clatters)

1745
01:25:35.155 --> 01:25:38.655
(energetic ominous music)

1746
01:25:47.826 --> 01:25:50.576
(gunshot blasts)

1747
01:26:00.482 --> 01:26:02.031
(men shouting)

1748
01:26:02.031 --> 01:26:07.031
(gun firing)
(bullet shells clinking)

1749
01:26:15.852 --> 01:26:18.352

1750
01:26:37.308 --> 01:26:39.058

01:26:57.702 --> 01:27:00.620
(hammers smacking)

1755
01:27:04.094 --> 01:27:04.928

The fuckin' bastards.

1758
01:27:08.755 --> 01:27:10.501
Bring him in.

1759
01:27:10.501 --> 01:27:12.966
Fuck at least. fuckin' high for this shit.

1760
01:27:12.966 --> 01:27:14.883
Get the fuck over here.

1761
01:27:15.771 --> 01:27:18.119
(men chattering loudly)

1762
01:27:18.119 --> 01:27:20.455
- [Man] Cut his fuckin' eye out.

1763
01:27:20.455 --> 01:27:23.404
What the fuck did we do?
- Fuckin' dog. hold on!

1764
01:27:23.404 --> 01:27:24.335
Let's go!

1765
01:27:24.335 --> 01:27:26.669
- [Man] Fuckin' double time.

1766
01:27:29.706 --> 01:27:30.996
- I'm gonna ask you a few questions.

1767
01:27:30.996 --> 01:27:33.450
and you better fuckin'
answer me in the right way.

1768
01:27:33.450 --> 01:27:35.282
Where the fuck is Joe?

(eerie electronic music)

1771
01:27:46.434 --> 01:27:47.895
One more fuckin' time.

1772
01:27:47.895 --> 01:27:49.055
I'm gonna ask you.

1773
01:27:49.055 --> 01:27:50.725
and you better fuckin'
answer me the right way.

1774
01:27:50.725 --> 01:27:52.933
otherwise Dom's gonna fuck you up.

1775
01:27:52.933 --> 01:27:55.434
Where the fuck is Joe?

1778

You're a real fuckin' tough guy. huh?

1779
01:28:04.460 --> 01:28:07.210
(gunshot blasts)

1780
01:28:11.114 --> 01:28:12.299
Mike. what the fuck?

1781
01:28:12.299 --> 01:28:13.493
I thought he was in the building.

1782
01:28:13.493 --> 01:28:14.565
- [Mike] I thought he
was in the building. too.

1783
01:28:14.565 --> 01:28:15.531
What the fuck. I don't know.

1784
01:28:15.531 --> 01:28:16.698
We thought we got the guy. but it was him.

1785
01:28:16.698 --> 01:28:17.539
What the fuck?

1786
01:28:17.539 --> 01:28:18.371
- Let's get the fuck out of here.

1787
01:28:18.371 --> 01:28:19.205
Dom. let's go.

1788
01:28:19.205 --> 01:28:22.267
Let's get the fuck outta here.

1789
01:28:22.267 --> 01:28:25.184

01:31:22.977 --> 01:31:26.120
- [Operator] This is the operator.

01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:28.132

(men shouting)

1827
01:32:31.168 --> 01:32:34.918
- What do we have here.
the king of Brooklyn.

1828
01:32:37.084 --> 01:32:38.425
- Come check this out. Clancy.

1829
01:32:38.425 --> 01:32:40.636
you gotta look at this.

1830
01:32:40.636 --> 01:32:42.636
- What the hell is this?

1831
01:32:43.583 --> 01:32:46.314
I never seen like. nothin' like it.

1832
01:32:46.314 --> 01:32:47.647
- [Clancy] Good.

1833
01:32:49.452 --> 01:32:50.370
Oh. my God.

1834
01:32:52.653 --> 01:32:53.546
- [Man In Beret] Check this out. Clancy.

1835
01:32:53.546 --> 01:32:54.753
Look at this metal stuff comin' out

1836
01:32:54.753 --> 01:32:55.585
of her head.
- Oh. my God.

1837
01:32:55.585 --> 01:32:56.805
what do we have here?
- Look at that.

1838
01:32:56.805 --> 01:32:57.789
What is that?

1839
01:32:57.789 --> 01:32:59.041
What is this metal stuff here?

1840
01:32:59.041 --> 01:33:00.318
Look at that. Clance.

1841
01:33:00.318 --> 01:33:01.856
- [Clancy] We have royalty here.

1842
01:33:01.856 --> 01:33:03.450
We have royalty.

1843
01:33:03.450 --> 01:33:04.697
Oh. my God.

1844
01:33:04.697 --> 01:33:07.501
We've had a full go on this one.

- [Operator] This is the operator.

1846
01:33:10.581 --> 01:33:13.400
- [Clancy] Yes. please
give me to. uh. 14. please.

01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:15.205
- [Operator] Your call

(cell phone ringing)

1851
01:33:31.002 --> 01:33:31.835
- Joe.

1852
01:33:33.344 --> 01:33:35.144
I think we should put
this one on ice. Joe.

1853
01:33:35.144 --> 01:33:36.811
We have a body here.

1854
01:33:38.224 --> 01:33:41.224
You gotta come take a look yourself.

1855
01:33:42.234 --> 01:33:44.648
This is royalty. Joe.

1856
01:33:44.648 --> 01:33:47.314
You have to see it yourself.

1857
01:33:47.314 --> 01:33:49.147
This has to go on ice.

1858
01:33:53.460 --> 01:33:55.718
- I know about that.

1859
01:33:55.718 --> 01:33:59.023
You must put that body on ice.

1860
01:33:59.023 --> 01:34:00.666
Bring it back to the warehouse.

1861
01:34:00.666 --> 01:34:05.666
and I'll inform you what to
do with my instructions later.

1862
01:34:05.874 --> 01:34:07.791
Don't leave any traces.

1863

- Adeet. (speaks Italian)?

1872
01:34:57.171 --> 01:34:59.421
- I just arrived in Sicily.

1873
01:35:01.823 --> 01:35:04.547
All the T25s are in place.

1874
01:35:04.547 --> 01:35:06.067
We're all ready to go.

1875
01:35:06.067 --> 01:35:07.615
Just give the word.

1876
01:35:07.615 --> 01:35:10.102
- Well. just to be clear.

1877
01:35:10.102 --> 01:35:13.312
I sent another party to
take care of Giacomo.

1878
01:35:13.312 --> 01:35:18.014
Sort of payback for the little
commotion that he stirred up.

1879
01:35:18.014 --> 01:35:20.960
So I don't need you to take care of him.

1880
01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:24.544
- But regarding this.
the Portofino family.

1881
01:35:25.889 --> 01:35:28.139
this one guy in particular.

1882
01:35:29.603 --> 01:35:33.940
you know who I'm talking
about. Peter Vecchio.

1883
01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:34.960
The guy's a stand up guy.

1884
01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:38.710
He was. he was like a
father to us. you know.

1885
01:35:39.818 --> 01:35:40.651
So what do you think?

1886
01:35:40.651 --> 01:35:44.495
Maybe we can give him
a. give him a pass. huh?

1887
01:35:44.495 --> 01:35:47.391
- He cannot be given a pass.

1888
01:35:47.391 --> 01:35:50.677
You see. a hit cannot be performed.

1889
01:35:50.677 --> 01:35:53.236
especially on a boss. without the consent

1890
01:35:53.236 --> 01:35:56.044
of the entire committee on the council.

1891
01:35:56.044 --> 01:35:58.870
I'm afraid he had to
have known about this.

1892
01:35:58.870 --> 01:36:01.308
In fact. I'm certain that he did.

1893
01:36:01.308 --> 01:36:04.657
As much as it pains me. and I know you.

1894
01:36:04.657 --> 01:36:07.059
this has to be taken care of.

1895
01:36:07.059 --> 01:36:09.892
He cannot walk away from this one.

1896
01:36:11.697 --> 01:36:13.096
- All right.

1897
01:36:13.096 --> 01:36:14.581
All right. we'll do.

1898
01:36:14.581 --> 01:36:16.752
Wait. wait. there is one more thing.

1899
01:36:16.752 --> 01:36:17.752
Michele.

1900
01:36:19.087 --> 01:36:22.254
Yeah. he's in the hospital with COVID.

1901
01:36:23.154 --> 01:36:25.663
He's on a respirator.

1902
01:36:25.663 --> 01:36:28.536
We're gonna get him no matter
what. that's not the issue.

1903
01:36:28.536 --> 01:36:31.036
The issue is his son. Michael.

1904
01:36:32.315 --> 01:36:34.364
I mean. I know he's a civilian.

1905
01:36:34.364 --> 01:36:37.864
but I think we should put him on the list.

1906
01:36:39.074 --> 01:36:42.290
He visits his father every
single night at eight o'clock.

1907
01:36:42.290 --> 01:36:45.993
We just get him when he's
coming out of the elevator.

1908
01:36:45.993 --> 01:36:47.216
What do you think?

1909
01:36:47.216 --> 01:36:49.079
- I agree. he needs to be wiped out.

1910
01:36:49.079 --> 01:36:52.522
He could be a problem in the future.

1911
01:36:52.522 --> 01:36:54.100
We have two members of the syndicate

1912
01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:56.290
there in the FBI.

1913
01:36:56.290 --> 01:36:59.567
They're in the general consulate there.

1914
01:36:59.567 --> 01:37:02.436
I'll make it look like he got wrapped up

1915
01:37:02.436 --> 01:37:04.914
in some things that he shouldn't have.

1916
01:37:04.914 --> 01:37:07.929
and he won't live to see the light of day.

1917
01:37:07.929 --> 01:37:10.477
As far as Michele.

1918
01:37:10.477 --> 01:37:11.921
we also have people on the inside.

1919
01:37:11.921 --> 01:37:13.921
We can take care of him.

1920
01:37:16.208 --> 01:37:19.736
I'll be in touch with
you when this is over.

1921
01:37:19.736 --> 01:37:20.818
- You got it.

1922
01:37:24.811 --> 01:37:28.061

1927
01:37:59.347 --> 01:38:00.656
(people chattering)
- Don't worry. I'm always

1928
01:38:00.656 --> 01:38:03.073
loyal to the Molinari family.

1929
01:38:04.476 --> 01:38:07.228
(man speaking Italian)

1930
01:38:07.228 --> 01:38:08.812
- Consider it done.

1931
01:38:10.184 --> 01:38:13.101
(foreboding music)

1932
01:38:19.081 --> 01:38:24.081
(equipment ticking)
(equipment beeping)

1933
01:38:28.034 --> 01:38:31.951
(energetic contemporary music)

1934
01:38:41.952 --> 01:38:44.369
(gun firing)

1935
01:38:50.138 --> 01:38:54.888
(energetic contemporary music continues)

1936
01:39:14.012 --> 01:39:17.094
(solemn choir music)

1937
01:39:41.825 --> 01:39:44.742
(utensil scraping)

1938
01:39:58.046 --> 01:39:59.879
- Oh. we have a guest.

1939
01:40:05.662 --> 01:40:06.912
Can I help you?

1940
01:40:07.867 --> 01:40:09.534
- Sit the fuck down.

1941
01:40:15.332 --> 01:40:19.968
You don't mind if I have
a little wine. do you?

1942
01:40:19.968 --> 01:40:22.718
(wine sloshing)

1943
01:40:25.398 --> 01:40:27.981
See. we took Joe Molinari's jet

1944
01:40:30.548 --> 01:40:31.546
all the way over here to Italy.

1945
01:40:31.546 --> 01:40:36.264
and we didn't come for no
fuckin' meatballs. either.

1946
01:40:36.264 --> 01:40:39.318
- Well. I hope you did your research

1947
01:40:39.318 --> 01:40:43.068
because you just broke
into my fuckin' house.

1948
01:40:44.009 --> 01:40:47.407
- We know what fuckin'
house we broke into.

1949
01:40:47.407 --> 01:40:50.673
We came here to take care of business.

1950
01:40:50.673 --> 01:40:53.755
So did you (laughs).

1951
01:40:55.213 --> 01:40:56.971
did you do your research

1952
01:40:56.971 --> 01:40:58.888
on who the fuck we are?

1953
01:41:03.898 --> 01:41:07.981
I guess you didn't when
you killed my boy. Snake.

1954
01:41:08.838 --> 01:41:13.421
You see how easy it was for
us to come into your house?

1955
01:41:14.351 --> 01:41:15.993
Did we get everybody?

1956
01:41:15.993 --> 01:41:19.745
- The house is all
clean. they're all dead.

1957
01:41:19.745 --> 01:41:20.683
- We want to see your fuckin' house

1958
01:41:20.683 --> 01:41:23.016
like it was a grocery store.

1959
01:41:24.716 --> 01:41:27.049
So see. you're not so tough.

1960
01:41:28.796 --> 01:41:33.587
See. we came over here on
Joe Molinari's private jet.

1961
01:41:33.587 --> 01:41:36.161
We didn't come over here
for no fuckin' vacation

1962
01:41:36.161 --> 01:41:39.661
to no Venice. or no Florence. or whatever.

1963
01:41:40.592 --> 01:41:43.656
We came over here to
take care of business.

1964
01:41:43.656 --> 01:41:46.239
See. you killed my boss. Snake.

1965
01:41:49.322 --> 01:41:52.891
And we didn't take that too lightly.

1966
01:41:52.891 --> 01:41:54.987
And I got a message for Joe Molinari.

1967
01:41:54.987 --> 01:41:59.987
Come tomorrow morning. all four
of your bosses will be dead.

1968
01:42:00.053 --> 01:42:01.636
Portofino. Michele.

1969
01:42:04.154 --> 01:42:06.404
Vicente. and Raphael. gone.

1970
01:42:13.416 --> 01:42:17.583
- You know. I want you to
have a little more wine.

1971
01:42:19.837 --> 01:42:21.333
(wine sloshing)

1972
01:42:21.333 --> 01:42:23.916
I like to treat my guests well.

1973
01:42:26.180 --> 01:42:28.307
(bottle cap rattling)
Listen. this is what

1974
01:42:28.307 --> 01:42:30.491
I want you to do.

1975
01:42:30.491 --> 01:42:33.074
I want you to go back. rethink.

1976
01:42:35.458 --> 01:42:38.291
I want you to knock off Joe. yeah.

1977
01:42:40.811 --> 01:42:43.696
And then I want you to come back.

1978
01:42:43.696 --> 01:42:47.139
and then you and I are
gonna work together.

1979
01:42:47.139 --> 01:42:48.472
Go on. drink up.

1980
01:42:51.190 --> 01:42:54.357
What do you think. you like that idea?

1981
01:42:55.261 --> 01:42:57.344
- So what's in it for me?

1982
01:42:58.827 --> 01:43:00.077
- Money. title.

1983
01:43:04.246 --> 01:43:06.267
like a boss. no?

1984
01:43:06.267 --> 01:43:08.517
How does that sound to you?

1985
01:43:16.264 --> 01:43:19.347
(solemn choir music)

1986
01:43:21.481 --> 01:43:23.543
These mother fuckers!

1987
01:43:23.543 --> 01:43:25.386
(table items crashing)

1988
01:43:25.386 --> 01:43:28.053
(Jocko gagging)

1989
01:43:31.634 --> 01:43:35.550
(solemn choir music continues)

1990
01:44:15.413 --> 01:44:17.565
(gun fires)

1991
01:44:17.565 --> 01:44:20.732
(elegant waltz music)

1992
01:44:22.994 --> 01:44:25.492
(glasses clinking)

1993
01:44:25.492 --> 01:44:26.773
- [Man] I must say. I've been admiring

1994
01:44:26.773 --> 01:44:29.370
your beautiful bracelet.

1995
01:44:29.370 --> 01:44:31.068
Where is this from?
- Thank you.

1996
01:44:31.068 --> 01:44:32.485
This is sapphire.

1997
01:44:33.388 --> 01:44:35.450
- It's 3.5 million.

1998
01:44:35.450 --> 01:44:36.350
- So I don't know how long you guys

1999
01:44:36.350 --> 01:44:37.776
are gonna be in Sicily visiting for.

2000
01:44:37.776 --> 01:44:40.580
but if you wanna take my yacht
and swing over by Milazzo.

2001
01:44:40.580 --> 01:44:41.413
it's very nice in there.

2002
01:44:41.413 --> 01:44:43.012
They got an end cove.
yous can check it out.

2003
01:44:43.012 --> 01:44:44.866
Relax. have a good time. have a few drinks

2004
01:44:44.866 --> 01:44:46.148
on the boat while you're here.

2005
01:44:46.148 --> 01:44:47.020
- I appreciate it. Tomaso.

2006
01:44:47.020 --> 01:44:48.996
I mean. we've been meaning to get away.

2007
01:44:48.996 --> 01:44:50.369
- Hey. don't mention
it. anything yous need.

2008
01:44:50.369 --> 01:44:51.202
How about you?

2009
01:44:51.202 --> 01:44:54.452
(man speaking Italian)

2010
01:44:56.920 --> 01:44:57.959
- [Tomaso] It's very romantic.

2011
01:44:57.959 --> 01:44:58.815
(man speaking Italian)

2012
01:44:58.815 --> 01:44:59.880
(cell phone buzzing)

2013
01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:01.106
- Excuse me guys. excuse me. fellows.

2014
01:45:01.106 --> 01:45:03.717
let me take this.
(man speaking Italian)

2015
01:45:03.717 --> 01:45:06.251
- [Man] Yes. you'll
definitely love that place.

2016
01:45:06.251 --> 01:45:08.485
Yeah. I've been there before.

2017
01:45:08.485 --> 01:45:12.485
(elegant waltz music continues)

2018
01:45:18.906 --> 01:45:19.992
- Scusi. I'll be right back.

2019
01:45:19.992 --> 01:45:20.992
Thank you.

2020
01:45:20.992 --> 01:45:22.636
- Hold on. where you going?

2021
01:45:22.636 --> 01:45:23.469
- I'm going to take a piss.

2022
01:45:23.469 --> 01:45:25.043
Why are you breaking my balls?

2023
01:45:25.043 --> 01:45:26.745
- You know you're not supposed
to be out of my sight.

2024
01:45:26.745 --> 01:45:29.329
Your father wants me to
keep an eye on you. always.

2025
01:45:29.329 --> 01:45:31.624
- You know I'm. right.
you know I'm gonna be

2026
01:45:31.624 --> 01:45:33.493
head of this table one day. right?

2027
01:45:33.493 --> 01:45:34.421
And if you want a seat at it.

2028
01:45:34.421 --> 01:45:36.282
you gotta relax. (speaks Italian)?

2029
01:45:36.282 --> 01:45:37.520
- All right.

2030
01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:40.353
(men chattering)

2031
01:45:40.353 --> 01:45:42.598
- [Man] Seriously. back and forth.

2032
01:45:42.598 --> 01:45:46.598
(elegant waltz music continues)

2033
01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:56.873
(knuckles rapping)

2034
01:45:56.873 --> 01:45:58.956
- Where you at. princess?

2035
01:46:02.922 --> 01:46:03.832
(gun fires)
Fuck!

2036
01:46:03.832 --> 01:46:05.749
Fuck. you motherfucker.

2037
01:46:07.904 --> 01:46:09.665
(Tomaso groaning)

2038
01:46:09.665 --> 01:46:12.117
(gun firing)
Fuck. fuck!

2039
01:46:12.117 --> 01:46:13.179
(Tomaso groaning)

2040
01:46:13.179 --> 01:46:15.671
Fuck. you motherfucker.

2041
01:46:15.671 --> 01:46:19.121
Fuck (groaning)!

2042
01:46:19.121 --> 01:46:21.871
Fuck (groaning).

2043
01:46:22.998 --> 01:46:26.831
- Come on. are you really
surprised to see me?

2044
01:46:29.046 --> 01:46:32.773
I can't believe you
even fell for this one.

2045
01:46:32.773 --> 01:46:35.761
Gotta hand it to the
Molinari family on this one.

2046
01:46:35.761 --> 01:46:38.190
- You fuck. you think you're
gonna leave this place?

2047
01:46:38.190 --> 01:46:40.335
My father will have you dead in an hour.

2048
01:46:40.335 --> 01:46:42.236
You'll never leave Sicily.

2049
01:46:42.236 --> 01:46:43.581
You couldn't keep your own family.

2050
01:46:43.581 --> 01:46:46.303
so you decided to hand it
over to the Molinari family.

2051
01:46:46.303 --> 01:46:51.303
You didn't have the balls
to hold out (groaning).

2052
01:46:51.570 --> 01:46:52.403
- Your father's dead.

2053
01:46:52.403 --> 01:46:54.199
(Tomaso coughing)

2054
01:46:54.199 --> 01:46:56.375
- [Tomaso] No. fuck.

2055
01:46:56.375 --> 01:46:58.458
- And so are your uncles.

2056
01:47:00.469 --> 01:47:02.422
Listen. I never liked you anyway.

2057
01:47:02.422 --> 01:47:04.638
and it's not because you're a faggot. huh.

2058
01:47:04.638 --> 01:47:08.237
It's because you're always
hiding behind your father.

2059
01:47:08.237 --> 01:47:10.505
- No. wait. wait. it doesn't
have to be like this.

2060
01:47:10.505 --> 01:47:13.071
Just wait. just wait.

2061
01:47:13.071 --> 01:47:13.904
- Wait?

2062
01:47:18.217 --> 01:47:19.518
I don't get paid to wait for you.

2063
01:47:19.518 --> 01:47:21.481
- I'll be shagging your
ass in hell. motherfucker.

2064
01:47:21.481 --> 01:47:23.814
(gun fires)

2065
01:47:25.484 --> 01:47:29.484
(elegant waltz music continues)

2066
01:47:32.357 --> 01:47:35.755
(wind rustling)

2067
01:47:35.755 --> 01:47:38.423
(bird tweeting)

2068
01:48:10.778 --> 01:48:13.361
- Adeet. so they sent you here?

2069
01:48:15.212 --> 01:48:17.401
You know. I always looked after you.

2070
01:48:17.401 --> 01:48:19.849
I never thought this. this role.

2071
01:48:19.849 --> 01:48:22.431
You were a bright kid.

2072
01:48:22.431 --> 01:48:25.823
and you could have been
anything you wanted to be.

2073
01:48:25.823 --> 01:48:28.110
but not a murderer.

2074
01:48:28.110 --> 01:48:29.509
- [Adeet] We all slip into
roles that are sometimes

2075
01:48:29.509 --> 01:48:31.994
not convenient for us.

2076
01:48:31.994 --> 01:48:36.092
- So I take it. I'm not gonna
meet my grandson over here?

2077
01:48:36.092 --> 01:48:37.660
- No.

2078
01:48:37.660 --> 01:48:39.418
The Molinari family is quite resourceful

2079
01:48:39.418 --> 01:48:41.384
with tampering of things.

2080
01:48:41.384 --> 01:48:44.856
such as your text messages
and your voicemails.

2081
01:48:44.856 --> 01:48:48.171
How did you think they wouldn't find out?

2082
01:48:48.171 --> 01:48:49.921
They know everything.

2083
01:48:51.915 --> 01:48:54.312
They're probably listening to
this conversation right now.

2084
01:48:54.312 --> 01:48:56.339
- And this is the problem.

2085
01:48:56.339 --> 01:48:59.120
They're growing too big. too fast.

2086
01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:01.952
and they wanna control everything.

2087
01:49:01.952 --> 01:49:06.660
And even you know that this
is not the right thing.

2088
01:49:06.660 --> 01:49:10.160
You can't break a 150 year old tradition.

2089
01:49:11.027 --> 01:49:14.651
You know. Adeet. we
Naboli Dons have a saying.

2090
01:49:14.651 --> 01:49:17.635
We bite small and we eat often.

2091
01:49:17.635 --> 01:49:19.885
If you bite big. you choke.

2092
01:49:22.597 --> 01:49:25.930
(man speaking Italian)

2093
01:49:44.005 --> 01:49:47.077
- You think I wanna be here right now?

2094
01:49:47.077 --> 01:49:51.413
You chose which side
you wanna be loyal to.

2095
01:49:51.413 --> 01:49:54.913
By screwing with Joe. you screwed me. too.

2096
01:49:57.188 --> 01:49:59.860
Now look what position I'm in.

2097
01:49:59.860 --> 01:50:01.360
I have to do this.

2098
01:50:02.210 --> 01:50:06.181
If I don't. they'll kill me.
too. and we'll both be dead.

01:50:06.181 --> 01:50:08.348
- Adeet. I'm gonna ask you

2100
01:50:09.423 --> 01:50:11.005
just this one time.

2101
01:50:12.745 --> 01:50:15.356
just this one time. walk away.

2102
01:50:15.356 --> 01:50:19.112
I'll grab my grandson. we'll
hop a plane to Argentina.

2103
01:50:19.112 --> 01:50:22.527
you'll never hear from us again.

2104
01:50:22.527 --> 01:50:25.610
He's the only thing that I have left.

2105
01:50:29.161 --> 01:50:32.411
(Adeet exhales loudly)

2106
01:50:34.630 --> 01:50:38.647
- Look. you promise me
if I let you walk away.

2107
01:50:38.647 --> 01:50:41.191
you would never come back.
never contact anyone.

2108
01:50:41.191 --> 01:50:42.773
you will disappear.

2109
01:50:46.916 --> 01:50:50.084
(gun silencer firing)

2110
01:50:51.642 --> 01:50:54.309
(wind rustling)

2111
01:50:57.257 --> 01:51:00.454
(bird cawing)

2112
01:51:00.454 --> 01:51:03.537
(solemn piano music)

2113
01:51:50.264 --> 01:51:53.848
(gentle melancholic music)
