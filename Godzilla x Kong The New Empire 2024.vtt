who are
culturally displaced and--

186
00:11:03.254 --> 00:11:04.940
Sure. but her culture's
not displaced.

187
00:11:04.964 --> 00:11:05.817
she is her culture.

188
00:11:05.841 --> 00:11:09.027
She's the last living member
of the Iwi tribe.

189
00:11:09.051 --> 00:11:11.554
We're just trying
to reach her.

190
00:11:12.179 --> 00:11:15.908
I know. Join the club.

For centuries.

the Iwi tribe werethe guardians of Skull Island.

200
00:12:14.824 --> 00:12:17.427
the ancestral home
of the great Kong.

201
00:12:17.451 --> 00:12:19.012
But when
shifting storm patterns

202
00:12:19.036 --> 00:12:21.931
destroyed the island.
the Iwi were annihilated...

203
00:12:21.955 --> 00:12:23.516
-[sighs]
-...with only a single member

204
00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:25.810
of the tribe having survived.

-A young girl...

...found and rescued
amid the punishing storm.

207
00:12:30.046 --> 00:12:32.024
Her fellow villagers
were lost to the tides.

208
00:12:32.048 --> 00:12:36.571
Gone to history. just like
the great Kongs themselves.

209
00:12:36.595 --> 00:12:37.237
Holy shit.

210
00:12:37.261 --> 00:12:38.781
-The Iwi were unique...
-[breathing heavily]

211
00:12:38.805 --> 00:12:41.200
...in the sense that they
had no spoken language.

212
00:12:41.224 --> 00:12:43.535
Many believe
that tribe members developed

213
00:12:43.559 --> 00:12:45.537

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.483
when the next Titan attacks?

229
00:13:58.507 --> 00:14:02.904
How will you protect
the things and people

go away!

242
00:14:27.035 --> 00:14:29.263
Uh. yes. I just want
to let everyone know

243
00:14:29.287 --> 00:14:30.138
that there is no...

244
00:14:30.162 --> 00:14:32.433
-[knocking on door]
-I'm gonna kill...

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:36.794
Uh...

247
00:14:37.628 --> 00:14:39.648
Hi. Bernie.

248
00:14:39.672 --> 00:14:42.800
Ilene Andrews.
we met in Hong Kong.

249
00:14:43.009 --> 00:14:43.944
Oh. Oh.

250
00:14:43.968 --> 00:14:44.695
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

251
00:14:44.719 --> 00:14:47.113
Hong Kong.
Yeah. that was so long ago.

252
00:14:47.137 --> 00:14:49.490
So. no. God. uh. yeah.

253
00:14:49.514 --> 00:14:50.868
That was when
my hair was longer.

254
00:14:50.892 --> 00:14:52.118
You cut your hair. [chuckles]

255
00:14:52.142 --> 00:14:54.561
Highlights too. it's nice.

256
00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:58.982
I was wondering if I could get
your help with something.

257
00:14:59.316 --> 00:15:01.610
-Me?
-Mm-hmm.

258
00:15:02.402 --> 00:15:02.962
Uh. sure.

259
00:15:02.986 --> 00:15:06.841
Sure. yeah. Of course. yeah.
Come on in. Doctor Andrews.

260
00:15:06.865 --> 00:15:08.342
-Okay.
-Yeah.

261
00:15:08.366 --> 00:15:09.969
Just straight down
that hall there.

262
00:15:09.993 --> 00:15:11.995
To the left. Okay.

263
00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.265
Have a seat.
What can I help you with?

264
00:15:15.289 --> 00:15:18.061
You know.mi casa es suhome.

265
00:15:18.085 --> 00:15:20.354
[Ilene] Okay. so.
The sequence on the right.

266
00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:22.731
this is a signal
that's been interfering

267
00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:24.149
with our equipment
in Hollow Earth.

268
00:15:24.173 --> 00:15:25.484
-Okay.
-And. uh...

269
00:15:25.508 --> 00:15:28.945
And these are drawings
by my daughter. Jia.

270
00:15:28.969 --> 00:15:32.574
And you're gonna think
that I'm completely insane.

271
00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:36.578
No. the patterns are the same
in the middle section.

272
00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:39.372
Yes. Exactly.

273
00:15:39.397 --> 00:15:41.041
[sighs] Thank you.

274
00:15:41.065 --> 00:15:42.125
Look. our analysts.

275
00:15:42.149 --> 00:15:43.877
they don't know
what to make of this.

276
00:15:43.901 --> 00:15:44.920
They're talking in circles.

277
00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:46.797
they're saying
"radio interference."

278
00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:47.756
"coincidence." but I...

279
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.841
I know that you think
outside of the box.

280
00:15:49.865 --> 00:15:52.468
[chuckles] I didn't know
who else to turn to.

281
00:15:52.492 --> 00:15:53.677
And they sent you
here because...?

282
00:15:53.701 --> 00:15:55.138
No. no one sent me.
I came here on my...

283
00:15:55.162 --> 00:15:56.389
You know.
that's what's ironic.

284
00:15:56.413 --> 00:15:57.556
You know.
Monarch wouldn't confirm

285
00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:00.226
my crucial part
in taking down Mechagodzilla.

286
00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:01.977
which cost me thousands of...

287
00:16:02.001 --> 00:16:04.188
hundreds of subscribers
on my blog.

288
00:16:04.212 --> 00:16:06.189
Oh. and the trolls...
[chuckles]

289
00:16:06.213 --> 00:16:07.483
the trolls online.
they question

290
00:16:07.507 --> 00:16:09.317
every single thing
that I put up.

291
00:16:09.341 --> 00:16:10.986
Especially this one troll.

292
00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:13.238
This one troll named
ghidorastan64.

293
00:16:13.262 --> 00:16:14.156
You ever heard of him?

294
00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:15.490
-No. I don't think I have.
-Great.

295
00:16:15.514 --> 00:16:16.700
because he's a trash bag.
okay?

296
00:16:16.724 --> 00:16:18.284
I'm more qualified
than half of those people

297
00:16:18.308 --> 00:16:19.661
that you have working
over there.

298
00:16:19.686 --> 00:16:21.371
I knew what Godzilla
was going to do

299
00:16:21.395 --> 00:16:22.664
before anybody
at Monarch said...

300
00:16:22.688 --> 00:16:26.168
Which is why I am here.
Bernie. [chuckles]

301
00:16:26.192 --> 00:16:28.694
I am here. Okay?

302
00:16:30.571 --> 00:16:33.031
Can you help me or not?

303
00:16:33.116 --> 00:16:33.883
That depends.

304
00:16:33.907 --> 00:16:36.678
Are you the new boss
down at the Mess?

305
00:16:36.702 --> 00:16:37.262
The what?

306
00:16:37.286 --> 00:16:39.097
The Monarch
Hollow Earth Station.

307
00:16:39.121 --> 00:16:40.807
The MHES. the Mess.

308
00:16:40.831 --> 00:16:42.183
Yeah. nobody calls it that.

309
00:16:42.207 --> 00:16:43.601
I run the Kong
research division

310
00:16:43.625 --> 00:16:46.646
but technically
Director Hampton is in charge

311
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:48.439
-of general operations.
-Hmm.

312
00:16:48.463 --> 00:16:50.607
Well. Director Hampton
doesn't have a kid

313
00:16:50.631 --> 00:16:52.801
who can talk to Kong.

314
00:16:55.888 --> 00:16:57.031
You want to go
to Hollow Earth.

315
00:16:57.055 --> 00:16:59.159
[gasps excitedly] I'm so glad
I didn't have to say it.

316
00:16:59.183 --> 00:17:00.325
I thought you were never
gonna ask

317
00:17:00.349 --> 00:17:01.952
-but I really do need proof.
-No. I'm not asking.

318
00:17:01.976 --> 00:17:03.495
I mean. that would help me
with my bona fides

319
00:17:03.519 --> 00:17:05.206
for my blog. And I knew
that you would be the person

320
00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:06.707
-to help me do that.
-[cell phone buzzing]

321
00:17:06.731 --> 00:17:08.375
Okay. Well. if this happens.
and that is a big if.

322
00:17:08.399 --> 00:17:09.543
then Monarch would need.
you know.

323
00:17:09.567 --> 00:17:11.294
whatever you guys call it.
Final cut on anything in...

324
00:17:11.318 --> 00:17:13.130
[Bernie] Whoa. I'm sorry.
final cut? No. no. no.

325
00:17:13.154 --> 00:17:16.424
You know. that will destroy
my journalistic integrity.

326
00:17:16.448 --> 00:17:17.009
Shit.

327
00:17:17.033 --> 00:17:19.052
No really true. good
documentarian gives final cut.

328
00:17:19.076 --> 00:17:20.095
I could make you a producer.

329
00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:21.554
Okay. okay! Fine! Final cut!
Final cut! Fine!

330
00:17:21.578 --> 00:17:23.264
Look. something is happening
to my daughter.

331
00:17:23.288 --> 00:17:26.392
and I have no idea
how to fix it.

332
00:17:26.416 --> 00:17:27.477
You work out what's going on.

333
00:17:27.501 --> 00:17:29.479
and I will get you anything
that you want. okay?

334
00:17:29.503 --> 00:17:30.771
That is a promise.

335
00:17:30.795 --> 00:17:31.731
Well. anything is a lot.

336
00:17:31.755 --> 00:17:33.024
but that's very generous.
but I...

337
00:17:33.049 --> 00:17:36.153
-And we have to go. Right now.
-What?

338
00:17:36.177 --> 00:17:38.154
Godzilla is on the move again.

00:18:34.357 --> 00:18:35.376
[Ilene] Okay. listen to me.

346
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.753
If Godzilla's on the move.
he senses a threat coming.

347
00:18:37.777 --> 00:18:38.671
We don't know what it is.

348
00:18:38.695 --> 00:18:40.215
[man on phone]
And you're not concerned?

349
00:18:40.239 --> 00:18:41.465
Of course we're concerned.
Senator.

350
00:18:41.489 --> 00:18:42.967
That's why we're monitoring
the situation.

351
00:18:42.991 --> 00:18:44.843
[Senator]Monitor the fact
that if Godzilla heads...

352
00:18:44.867 --> 00:18:45.803
What is it? You just...

353
00:18:45.827 --> 00:18:47.304
-And I am telling you.
-We have a problem!

354
00:18:47.328 --> 00:18:47.972
Senator...

355
00:18:47.996 --> 00:18:49.389
that Kong doesn't
leave Hollow Earth.

356
00:18:49.413 --> 00:18:54.186
Which is why Godzilla has
no reason to retaliate.

Are you getting
anything off that thing?

736
00:38:59.334 --> 00:39:01.003
Yeah. I'm just...

737
00:39:03.255 --> 00:39:04.649
Oh. my God.

738
00:39:04.673 --> 00:39:06.133
What?

739
00:39:06.717 --> 00:39:08.153
Here. Take a look.

740
00:39:08.177 --> 00:39:11.530
It looks like an ape.
But that's impossible.

741
00:39:11.554 --> 00:39:14.117
What the bloody hell is that?

742
00:39:14.141 --> 00:39:15.534
I have no idea.

Calm down. Calm down.

752
00:39:31.492 --> 00:39:33.093
It must've been the signal.
The same electrical

753
00:39:33.117 --> 00:39:35.095
disturbances were
happening at the outpost.

[sighs heavily]

757
00:39:42.418 --> 00:39:45.338
She says it's coming
from that ridge point.

758
00:39:50.301 --> 00:39:51.487
Well. let's take a look.

759
00:39:51.511 --> 00:39:54.095

[gasps]

766
00:40:12.613 --> 00:40:15.927
A world untouched by mankind.

767
00:40:15.951 --> 00:40:18.720
Is this
how Neil Armstrong felt

768
00:40:18.744 --> 00:40:22.082
when he stepped on alien soil?

769
00:40:22.623 --> 00:40:25.685
[over video]Is this one small step for me.

770
00:40:25.709 --> 00:40:27.020
and one giant leap for...

771
00:40:27.044 --> 00:40:28.397
Who are you talking to?

772
00:40:28.421 --> 00:40:29.273
Are you kidding me?

773
00:40:29.297 --> 00:40:30.982
Right down the lens?
It's a documentary.

774
00:40:31.006 --> 00:40:32.651
You wanna be natural.
Just walk. if you just walk.

775
00:40:32.675 --> 00:40:35.571

[Bernie clears throat]

777
00:40:37.304 --> 00:40:41.284
The Hollow Earth. A world...

778
00:40:41.308 --> 00:40:43.787
[Mikael] All right. guys.
That ridge you pointed out

779
00:40:43.811 --> 00:40:46.856
is about two miles
straight ahead.

780
00:40:49.316 --> 00:40:50.210
[mosquitos buzzing]

781
00:40:50.234 --> 00:40:52.212
I'm getting eaten alive
out here.

[mosquito buzzing]

783
00:40:53.487 --> 00:40:58.242
Oh. look at that.
I must be tasty too.

784
00:40:58.617 --> 00:41:00.034
Kill it.

785
00:41:00.159 --> 00:41:03.222
Only female mosquitos
drink blood.

786
00:41:03.246 --> 00:41:05.015
So they can grow their eggs.

787
00:41:05.039 --> 00:41:07.059
[mosquito buzzing]

788
00:41:07.083 --> 00:41:09.460
She needs it more than me.

[captivating music playing]

790
00:41:24.142 --> 00:41:25.827
[Trapper] Wait.

791
00:41:25.851 --> 00:41:29.122
-[Ilene] What?
-What's the holdup?

792
00:41:29.146 --> 00:41:30.790
Not this way.

793
00:41:30.814 --> 00:41:31.458
What? Why?

794
00:41:31.482 --> 00:41:33.710
Yeah. we gotta take a detour.
There's something here.

795
00:41:33.734 --> 00:41:36.337
Where. here? Like here. here?

796
00:41:36.361 --> 00:41:37.964
[Ilene] Hey.

797
00:41:37.988 --> 00:41:39.799
Nah. I'm not picking
anything up.

798
00:41:39.823 --> 00:41:41.426
No. Something
doesn't smell right.

799
00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:42.677
and it's not just you. Mikael.

800
00:41:42.701 --> 00:41:45.889
Can you smell that?
It's like rotting flesh.

801
00:41:45.913 --> 00:41:48.224
It's probably
just a carcass upwind.

802
00:41:48.248 --> 00:41:49.683
-We keep moving.
-Mikael. hold up.

803
00:41:49.707 --> 00:41:51.227

all day long. You got me?

807
00:41:57.674 --> 00:41:59.402
There's no need to call
people names. We're just...

808
00:41:59.426 --> 00:42:00.694
Hey. And as for you.
freak show.

809
00:42:00.718 --> 00:42:02.988
if you don't shut it.
I'm gonna take that camera.

810
00:42:03.012 --> 00:42:04.781
I'm gonna shove it
right up your arse.

811
00:42:04.805 --> 00:42:05.741
I'm in charge. we move.

812
00:42:05.765 --> 00:42:07.701
Why don't we just listen
to somebody calmer?

813
00:42:07.725 --> 00:42:09.036
I said I'm in charge.

814
00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:10.287
I'm in charge! [yells]

[Bernie] It was a tree.
It was a tree!

820
00:42:20.112 --> 00:42:21.131
[Trapper] Wait. wait. wait.

821
00:42:21.155 --> 00:42:22.757
We should be all right.
We should be all right.

822
00:42:22.781 --> 00:42:24.426
Those things
don't reach that far.

823
00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:25.469
He was just eaten by a tree.

824
00:42:25.493 --> 00:42:27.054
-[Trapper] What you doing. Doc?
-[radio beeps]

825
00:42:27.078 --> 00:42:28.639
[Ilene] I'm trying to call
the Base for extraction.

826
00:42:28.663 --> 00:42:30.307
[Bernie] It's just. one minute
he was there. right?

827
00:42:30.331 --> 00:42:31.642
He was right in my face.
And then. a tree!

828
00:42:31.666 --> 00:42:32.892
-Outta nowhere!
-I know. man.

829
00:42:32.916 --> 00:42:33.809
I know. That's heavy.

830
00:42:33.833 --> 00:42:35.144
But that's
the natural world. man.

You just watched a man

get devoured
by a topiary nightmare.

834
00:42:40.048 --> 00:42:42.526
and you want to quote
Tennyson? Down here?

835
00:42:42.551 --> 00:42:45.446
Yeah. Yeah. man.
He knew all about it.

836
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:48.282
"Let love clasp grief." man.
Come here.

837
00:42:48.306 --> 00:42:49.200
[Bernie] Mm.

838
00:42:49.224 --> 00:42:50.409
You know. humans.
we think we took

839
00:42:50.433 --> 00:42:52.161
ourselves off the food chain.

840
00:42:52.185 --> 00:42:58.233
but maybe. maybe the Titans
are here to remind us.

841
00:42:58.608 --> 00:43:00.001
I think that
there is something

842
00:43:00.025 --> 00:43:02.237
seriously wrong with you.

843
00:43:02.654 --> 00:43:03.797
-Okay.
-Mm-kay.

844
00:43:03.821 --> 00:43:05.048

-[radio beeps]
-[sighs] It's not working.

846
00:43:07.199 --> 00:43:11.161
We better move on.
We'll mourn later.

847
00:43:12.162 --> 00:43:13.223
Jia. Come on.

848
00:43:13.247 --> 00:43:14.849
-Come on. bud.
-But the...

00:43:14.873 --> 00:43:16.559
He was eaten by a tree.

850
00:43:16.583 --> 00:43:19.229
I don't...
I don't want to die like that.

851
00:43:19.253 --> 00:43:21.005
Not by a tree.

Extremely aggressive.

Weaponizing her body
of razor-sharp scales...

If Godzilla takes down Tiamat.
he'll supercharge.

Yeah.

883

The markings are older

What's she saying. Doc?

1076
00:59:37.283 --> 00:59:40.662
The beacon that we've been
following. it's...

1077
00:59:41.954 --> 00:59:44.666

So. wait. They send out
this SOS. and then what?

1080
01:00:00.472 --> 01:00:01.740
Godzilla hears it?

1081
01:00:01.764 --> 01:00:03.909
Yeah. They woke him up.

1082
01:00:03.933 --> 01:00:05.411
An SOS for what?
They already live

1083
01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:06.704
in a nightmare
monster hellscape.

1084
01:00:06.728 --> 01:00:07.996
What could possibly
scare them?

1085
01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:10.123
Hey. She can understand
everything that you say.

1086
01:00:10.147 --> 01:00:12.751
-She understands me?
-Oh. good.

1087
01:00:12.775 --> 01:00:14.211
And a nightmare

1088
01:00:14.235 --> 01:00:18.490
is a wonderful place
to raise a family.

1101
01:01:27.264 --> 01:01:31.494
Hollow Earth lived in harmony
with the surface world.

1102
01:01:31.518 --> 01:01:34.622
The Titans were
the guardians of nature

1103
01:01:34.646 --> 01:01:39.777
and the Great Apes became
the protectors of humanity.

1104

threatened the peace.

1110
01:01:59.545 --> 01:02:00.439
[Ilene] There's more.

1111
01:02:00.463 --> 01:02:03.859
The war with the Apes
nearly destroyed Godzilla.

1112
01:02:03.883 --> 01:02:05.569
But after a great battle.

1113
01:02:05.593 --> 01:02:06.861
he imprisoned the apes

1114
01:02:06.885 --> 01:02:09.073

of Hollow Earth.

1115
01:02:09.097 --> 01:02:11.700
