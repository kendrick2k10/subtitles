Now it may not be what
you're accustomed to...

74
00:07:44.714 --> 00:07:47.925
but I'm sure you'll get
used to it at some point.

75
00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:50.595
What the fuck are you talkin' about man?

76
00:07:50.803 --> 00:07:53.297
Look. this guy was chasing me.
Trying to get my bag and shit.

77
00:07:53.347 --> 00:07:55.558
But if you just show
me where the door is...

78
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.729
I swear you'll never see my face again
man. Like I'm not with that fuck shit.

79
00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:04.150
Oh. shit indeed. We all
have our share of shit. son...

80
00:08:05.359 --> 00:08:08.654
But you know the shit you're
carrying around. it's a heavy load.

81
00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:11.774
It's about time you let it go.

82
00:08:11.824 --> 00:08:16.829
Nah. I'm good. It's light as a
feather. Where'd you say the door was?

83
00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:20.875
You got to give it up.
son. It's not too late.

84
00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:25.296
I'm not your fuckin' son!

85
00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:28.090
Door's right there.

86
00:08:30.134 --> 00:08:33.713
Alright old man. But next time
you try to preach somebody...

87
00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:36.340
make sure you pay your
fuckin' light bill. man.

88
00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:37.517
It's pathetic.

95
00:09:44.333 --> 00:09:47.086
What the fuck? What the fuck was that man?

96
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.506
The guy that was chasing me showed
up in the desert and now I'm here.

97
00:09:50.756 --> 00:09:53.342
That's that heavy load you're carrying.

98
00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:58.806
All doors lead to the same place. You
gotta get rid of that heavy weight. boy.

99
00:09:58.889 --> 00:10:00.683
I'm trying to help you.

100
00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:03.060
So what do you want me to do?

101
00:10:03.686 --> 00:10:06.397
You want me to stand here
and just tell you my sins?

102
00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:08.357
Who the fuck are you?

103
00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:12.778
You know. I see a little of myself in you.

104
00:10:13.821 --> 00:10:14.905
Hard-headed.

105
00:10:15.823 --> 00:10:19.994
Nobody could tell me shit. Then one day...

106
00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:22.538
it all came to an end.

107
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:26.125
You don't know shit about me
with your old washed-up ass!

108
00:10:26.417 --> 00:10:28.252
Oh. so that wasn't you?

109
00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:31.839
That wasn't you who
robbed the jewelry store?

110
00:10:31.922 --> 00:10:34.166
That wasn't you who raped those women?

111
00:10:34.216 --> 00:10:37.044
That wasn't you who
murdered his own brother?

112
00:10:37.094 --> 00:10:38.929
That wasn't you???

113
00:10:39.722 --> 00:10:41.223
Man. FUCK YOU!

114
00:10:57.657 --> 00:10:59.367
(wrench clanks)

115
00:11:12.755 --> 00:11:13.881
Oh!

116
00:11:14.882 --> 00:11:16.801

117
00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:23.099
(Troy gasps in pain)

118
00:11:38.572 --> 00:11:42.743
(Virgil) Are you ready to face the truth?

119
00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:47.415
It's scary. I know. But
nothing's gonna change...

120
00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:52.545
unless you let go. Just let go.

121
00:11:55.673 --> 00:11:57.675
So what are you saying old man?

122
00:11:58.384 --> 00:12:01.595
If I give you my stuff then I'm free to go?

123
00:12:01.929 --> 00:12:07.643
It's just that simple. You
sit here and you just purge.

124
00:12:07.685 --> 00:12:11.147
You know. a confessional if you will.

125
00:12:12.106 --> 00:12:14.775
Well. here's my fuckin' confession.

126
00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:17.228
My parents were both crackheads...

127
00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:19.405
and they ain't give a shit about me.

128
00:12:20.865 --> 00:12:25.703
Yeah I sold drugs. But that
robbery. it was necessary.

129
00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:29.415
And that bitch. she wanted it.

130
00:12:30.624 --> 00:12:34.545
Ultimately. I did what
I had to do to survive.

131
00:12:35.546 --> 00:12:38.924
Okay am I done now? Can I go?

132
00:12:41.552 --> 00:12:43.179
It's a start.

133
00:12:50.352 --> 00:12:56.901
If you knew me. then you would know this
is the part where you kiss my black ass.

134
00:13:08.287 --> 00:13:09.613
Give it to me you piece of shit!

135
00:13:09.663 --> 00:13:10.539
Fuck you!

136
00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:13.751
OH!

137
00:13:14.126 --> 00:13:16.962
(wrench smashing)

138
00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:22.927
Fuck you old man! You want the bag?

139
00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:44.949
Are you satisfied?

140
00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:48.118
You've gone behind every door available...

141
00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.996
and still... no prize.

142
00:13:54.917 --> 00:13:56.210
Give it here son.

143
00:13:56.627 --> 00:14:00.631
The only thing it's caused
you is a ton of trouble.

144
00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:11.016
So that's it? I'm free to go?

145
00:14:11.767 --> 00:14:12.643
That's it.

146
00:14:14.186 --> 00:14:16.188
Michael will show you out.

147
00:14:17.022 --> 00:14:17.857
Who?

148
00:14:18.899 --> 00:14:20.693
(Michael ROARS)

149
00:14:35.749 --> 00:14:42.089
(Det. Morales) I know.
But it's part of the job. man.

150
00:14:45.009 --> 00:14:49.388
Do you remember flight quarter? Yeah.

151
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.811
So you know how thorough we had to...

152
00:15:09.617 --> 00:15:17.617
Yeah. I'm here. I think I
just found something. Hold on.

153
00:15:29.219 --> 00:15:32.348
Must be my lucky day.

154
00:15:38.395 --> 00:15:39.355
Mr. Jones...

155
00:15:41.815 --> 00:15:44.360
I think I found our murder weapon.

156
00:15:49.323 --> 00:15:51.867
I said. I...

157
00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:01.752
{jazzy music}

158
00:16:03.837 --> 00:16:05.130
Did it hurt?

159
00:16:05.422 --> 00:16:06.340
I'm sorry?

160
00:16:06.715 --> 00:16:09.134
When you fell from heaven? Did it hurt?

161
00:16:09.176 --> 00:16:13.305
It's a pick-up line. I'm
seducing you. This is seduction.

162
00:16:13.555 --> 00:16:16.050
You must have me mistaken for someone else.

163
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.393
Have a good day.

164
00:16:17.726 --> 00:16:20.688
That makes me sad. I thought
we could've had something.

165
00:16:20.813 --> 00:16:24.975
Movie night. sex. text
fighting. makeup sex.

166
00:16:25.025 --> 00:16:28.362
It's okay to want that.
You're a man. not a robot.

167
00:16:28.529 --> 00:16:31.573
Or are you a robot? Beep Boop Beep.

168
00:16:32.408 --> 00:16:33.325
Do I know you?

169
00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:37.830
I sell needs for Dante's Delivery.
Sometimes pills. sometimes my body.

170
00:16:37.913 --> 00:16:39.806
You're gonna have to give
me stupid green paper for that.

171
00:16:39.848 --> 00:16:41.909
but you can always make more.

172
00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:43.002
I'm Barnaby.

173
00:16:43.168 --> 00:16:44.211
I'm Clementine.

174
00:16:44.253 --> 00:16:47.915
And you don't have to use a condom
with me cause I'll just miscarry.

175
00:16:47.965 --> 00:16:49.216
Let's get high!

176
00:16:56.432 --> 00:17:00.143
So this is awkward. I'm
raising your pill prices.

177
00:17:00.185 --> 00:17:03.731
$5 for 20 and $500 for each date night.

178
00:17:03.981 --> 00:17:05.441
A.K.A. fucking.

00:17:05.607 --> 00:17:06.900
I can't afford that.

180
00:17:07.067 --> 00:17:08.352
Maybe we should break up then.

181
00:17:08.402 --> 00:17:09.361
But I love you!

182
00:17:09.695 --> 00:17:14.908
I don't know Barnaby. If you can't pay me
what I'm worth then we should just end it.

183
00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:19.788
Here. Don't overdose. okay? I'll feel bad.

184
00:17:23.417 --> 00:17:26.378
{sad music}

185
00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:39.049
God! I hate Clementine.

186
00:17:39.099 --> 00:17:40.434
Fuckin' hate her!

187
00:17:40.517 --> 00:17:43.812
Gets me hooked on drugs.
making me buy her love.

188
00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.816
I'd sell my soul for true love.

189
00:17:49.318 --> 00:17:51.153
Girl problems huh?

190
00:17:51.361 --> 00:17:54.865
I could find you a girl that will
love you for the rest of your life...

191
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:56.700
in exchange for your soul.

192
00:17:57.034 --> 00:17:57.910
I need my soul.

193
00:17:58.202 --> 00:17:59.036
No you don't.

194
00:17:59.328 --> 00:18:00.120
Yes I do.

195
00:18:00.287 --> 00:18:02.289
No you don't. You know need your soul.

196
00:18:02.414 --> 00:18:04.583
Penny here. she thought
she needed her soul.

197
00:18:04.666 --> 00:18:07.419
Penny sold her soul to me.
She's never been happier.

198
00:18:07.461 --> 00:18:09.171
I sold my soul to commit murder.

199
00:18:09.254 --> 00:18:11.673
I could stab you in a police
station and get away with it.

200
00:18:12.049 --> 00:18:16.345
You see Barnaby. you could either do
this the true-love-sell-your-soul way...

201
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:18.055
or we could do it Penny's way.

202
00:18:18.889 --> 00:18:20.015
Uh... true love

203
00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.601
Great. I have a contract
for you right here.

204
00:18:22.643 --> 00:18:27.815

Thank you guys.

216
00:18:56.718 --> 00:18:57.318
Bye bye.

217
00:18:57.803 --> 00:19:01.682
We'll be seeing you
Barnaby. See you real soon.

218
00:19:02.432 --> 00:19:03.892
(spooky female singing)

219
00:19:04.101 --> 00:19:11.183
♪ Ring around the rosy.
a pocket full of posies... ♪

220
00:19:11.233 --> 00:19:19.233
♪ Ashes... ashes... We all fall... ♪

221
00:19:19.783 --> 00:19:21.076
DOWN!!!

222
00:19:25.289 --> 00:19:28.167
Barnaby! I'm so glad we're back together.

223
00:19:28.375 --> 00:19:32.871
I need new tires on my car.
so I'll let you fuck me for $460.

224
00:19:32.921 --> 00:19:36.603
That covers the front and
the back. So that means

225
00:19:36.663 --> 00:19:40.345
that you can fuck me
from the front and the back.

226
00:19:41.847 --> 00:19:43.015
Right here?

227
00:19:43.765 --> 00:19:48.145
Barnaby! There you are my love.

228
00:20:09.124 --> 00:20:09.917
Hi!

229
00:20:10.626 --> 00:20:12.002
I'm Lilith.

230
00:20:12.461 --> 00:20:17.341
And if you ever talk to my man again. I
will beat you to death with a sledgehammer.

231
00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:20.647
I'm sorry. I don't speak
weirdo-she-devil-slut.

232
00:20:20.707 --> 00:20:23.804
Do you know who the fuck I
am? You're Clementine Sanders.

233
00:20:23.864 --> 00:20:26.558
You're a 26 year old pill pusher.
and an STD filled white-trash hooker...

234
00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.971
that lives in the back of a van because of
credit debt from a vitamin pyramid scheme.

235
00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:32.105
Ugh!

236
00:20:34.024 --> 00:20:35.442
You're not real.

237
00:20:35.734 --> 00:20:36.985
I think I'm real.

238
00:20:37.152 --> 00:20:40.405
I think can pat my head and
rub my tummy at the same time.

239
00:20:40.489 --> 00:20:43.200
And I think I give the best hugs.

240
00:20:43.742 --> 00:20:49.122
I'll explain everything.
Barnaby. inside with me!

241
00:20:49.873 --> 00:20:52.834
(crazy snorting laugh)

242
00:20:57.339 --> 00:21:03.053
You fixed my wing. You're
like a... like a wing fixer

243
00:21:03.512 --> 00:21:04.888
Yes. I am.

244
00:21:08.684 --> 00:21:11.061
So. I died 2 years ago.

245
00:21:11.687 --> 00:21:15.607
The Wormwood Brothers kidnapped
me after Christmas karaoke.

246
00:21:15.732 --> 00:21:20.654
Then chained me to a radiator and they made
me their three-month battered fuck doll.

247
00:21:20.862 --> 00:21:23.135
When they got tired of me. they barb-wired

248
00:21:23.195 --> 00:21:25.742
weights to my ankles
and threw me in the river.

249
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:30.080
After I drowned I made a deal
with the Devil to bring me back.

250
00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:35.836
So a week later. I wake up
in a morgue. and I walk out...

251
00:21:35.919 --> 00:21:39.923
And I tortured them to
death for three months.

252
00:21:43.051 --> 00:21:45.887
But I got something better than revenge.

253
00:21:46.805 --> 00:21:51.935
Barnaby. You're the best
deal with the Devil I ever made.

254
00:21:53.645 --> 00:21:56.606
I love you more than pills.

255
00:22:00.694 --> 00:22:03.196
I'll get you clean.

256
00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:08.160
Look. it's a blackbird.

257
00:22:11.955 --> 00:22:13.949
- Let me kill Clementine. - No.

258
00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:16.388
Come on! Rainbow Cunt turns
my Barnabug into an addict.

259
00:22:16.448 --> 00:22:18.837
I'm just supposed to stand by?

260
00:22:18.879 --> 00:22:20.289
I want blood!

261
00:22:20.339 --> 00:22:21.548
Ooh. I'll cut her open for ya.

262
00:22:21.715 --> 00:22:22.758
Shut up psycho.

263
00:22:22.924 --> 00:22:23.967
Fucking whore!

264
00:22:24.217 --> 00:22:26.169
Wow. you two are catty. Meow!

265
00:22:26.219 --> 00:22:28.638
I will give you
Clementine's supplier. Deal?

266
00:22:28.722 --> 00:22:29.848
- Deal. - Good.

267
00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:31.725
What do you want in return?

268
00:22:32.017 --> 00:22:35.645
I would like a mayonnaise sandwich.

269
00:22:36.521 --> 00:22:37.647
That's gross.

270
00:22:37.898 --> 00:22:38.857
Yeah. you're gross.

271
00:22:39.024 --> 00:22:40.942
You're fucking gross.

272
00:22:42.069 --> 00:22:44.613
Fuck you! That's still gross.

273
00:22:45.655 --> 00:22:46.406
Bye bye.

274
00:22:49.534 --> 00:22:52.162
I got you a one day anniversary gift!

275
00:22:52.412 --> 00:22:53.372
Is it a gift card?

276
00:22:53.538 --> 00:22:54.164
No.

277
00:22:54.581 --> 00:22:56.249
Is it a new puppy?

278
00:22:56.458 --> 00:22:57.125
No.

279
00:23:01.004 --> 00:23:02.964
Are we gonna have a threesome on day one?

280
00:23:03.256 --> 00:23:04.674
(Daisy coughs)

281
00:23:04.966 --> 00:23:07.544
TA DA! It's Clementine's supplier.

282
00:23:07.594 --> 00:23:12.265
This is Daisy the Dealer. She's been
pushing opiates on your back alley slut.

283
00:23:12.474 --> 00:23:18.146
Let's get one thing straight here. I am
a pharmaceutical representative. okay.

284
00:23:18.397 --> 00:23:25.654
I sell samples to hookers and fuck doctors
for contracts... but it's sales. man.

285
00:23:27.489 --> 00:23:32.694
I beat Daisy with a crowbar and then
I poured gasoline down her throat...

286
00:23:32.744 --> 00:23:36.748
and I'm going to set her
pretty little insides on fire.

287
00:23:37.082 --> 00:23:40.293
That's for me. For you...

288
00:23:40.752 --> 00:23:43.380
we're going to flush your pills.

289
00:23:44.339 --> 00:23:46.341
Hey no. No no no. Can we not?

290
00:23:46.967 --> 00:23:50.345
Okay. if you let me go. I'll quit selling.

291
00:23:50.846 --> 00:23:53.098
I will. I don't even like doing it.

292
00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:57.477
I don't even like doing it. I
don't like making the six figures.

293
00:23:57.769 --> 00:23:59.688
I don't like the exotic cruises.

294
00:23:59.813 --> 00:24:03.567
I gotta buy a new bikini like every
week. it's awful on my bank account.

295
00:24:03.859 --> 00:24:05.685
I should be like you guys.

296
00:24:05.735 --> 00:24:09.564
I could live here in this rapey garage...

297
00:24:09.614 --> 00:24:11.616
and we could eat instant noodles...

298
00:24:11.658 --> 00:24:14.744
and masturbate at the wall!

299
00:24:14.786 --> 00:24:17.122
Okay. That looks like fun!

300
00:24:17.205 --> 00:24:20.583
Let me have some of
that. I want to be that guy.

301
00:24:20.625 --> 00:24:22.536
Come on. I can so be that guy.

302
00:24:22.586 --> 00:24:24.254
You know. we could do it together.

303
00:24:24.546 --> 00:24:25.146
Yeah?

304
00:24:25.755 --> 00:24:28.250
Yeah! He already likes it.

305
00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:29.843
Oh he does. Alright. open your mouth.

306
00:24:34.097 --> 00:24:34.697
Fuck!

307
00:24:37.601 --> 00:24:39.686
Barnaby. why do you look so sad?

308
00:24:39.936 --> 00:24:42.814
Does it burn? I got a pill for that.

309
00:24:42.898 --> 00:24:43.498
No!

310
00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:47.360
Fine! I'll just make it
easy. No fun for me.

311
00:24:49.154 --> 00:24:52.115
(Daisy gasps)

312
00:24:53.116 --> 00:24:54.701
Woo! I love you. Barnaby.

313
00:25:05.921 --> 00:25:07.505
I would like to request a refund.

314
00:25:07.547 --> 00:25:09.424
It doesn't work that way.

315
00:25:09.549 --> 00:25:12.010
Uh. well can I get
Clementine to love me instead?

316
00:25:12.177 --> 00:25:15.046
The trailer-trash hooker
that got you addicted to pills?

317
00:25:15.096 --> 00:25:16.973
Mhm. that's the one.

318
00:25:17.432 --> 00:25:18.183
Alright.

319
00:25:18.767 --> 00:25:23.396
Click that activation
email and you're all set.

320
00:25:23.647 --> 00:25:25.649
Can I get a gun for protection?

321
00:25:25.774 --> 00:25:27.984
Yeah. It's loaded. Have fun.

322
00:25:28.068 --> 00:25:28.944
Thanks.

323
00:25:32.739 --> 00:25:35.242
I need to make Barnaby love me.

324
00:25:35.575 --> 00:25:37.452
That's fine. 20 bucks.

325
00:25:40.497 --> 00:25:45.919
Alright. just remember
to click that activation link.

326
00:25:46.086 --> 00:25:48.463
Oh. Clementine's ours now.

327
00:25:48.797 --> 00:25:50.632
Do whatever you want to her.

328
00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:55.512
Can I have a sledgehammer?
It's my wedding day.

329
00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.760

332
00:26:10.735 --> 00:26:13.863
So. I did something kinda crazy.

333
00:26:14.614 --> 00:26:19.578
The church down the street does
these pedophile anonymous meetings...

334
00:26:19.995 --> 00:26:24.833
and I needed to let off some
steam. so I killed them all.

335
00:26:26.293 --> 00:26:30.497
And now when we get married in the
church. their ghosts will be our guests.

336
00:26:30.547 --> 00:26:33.174
And I like three cups of coffee!

337
00:26:33.592 --> 00:26:35.135
That's three too many.

338
00:26:35.677 --> 00:26:36.720

00:26:37.512 --> 00:26:38.847
Barnaby!

340
00:26:40.515 --> 00:26:41.558
Put down the gun.

341
00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:44.853
Give me the gun!

342
00:26:45.979 --> 00:26:47.314
(BANG!)

343
00:26:48.773 --> 00:26:51.101
Oh God! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

344
00:26:51.151 --> 00:26:52.986
I just need to check my email.

346
00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:59.200
It's just a flesh wound.
I'll take you to the hospital.

347
00:26:59.242 --> 00:27:01.494
Arrgh! Fucking Google.

348
00:27:01.786 --> 00:27:07.334
I just have to get a confirmation
text and then I confirm my password.

349
00:27:09.002 --> 00:27:12.972
Barnaby! Please let me
in. I love you so much.

350
00:27:13.032 --> 00:27:17.002

Did you hear that. Clementine?
Barnaby says he loves me now.

371
00:29:01.948 --> 00:29:06.327
You want him to have your heart?
I'm going to cut it out you fucking bitch.

372
00:29:06.619 --> 00:29:11.040
We have to get to the
church. Our guests are waiting.

373
00:29:11.332 --> 00:29:14.377
There's no time Barnabug.
You're not gonna make it.

374
00:29:14.502 --> 00:29:15.302
I don't want to die.

375
00:29:24.179 --> 00:29:26.681
It's okay. Barnabug.

376
00:29:29.809 --> 00:29:31.728
We're going home.

(gunshot)

378
00:29:47.285 --> 00:29:52.365
(Penny) I have something for you.
She would do anything to be an actress.

379
00:29:52.415 --> 00:29:54.857
Wow! Well anyone could be an actress

380
00:29:54.917 --> 00:29:57.712
but it takes selling your
soul to make it on Broadway.

381
00:29:57.879 --> 00:30:01.166
Is that what you want?
Intermissions? Old people?

382
00:30:01.216 --> 00:30:03.134
Fuck it! What could go wrong?

383
00:30:03.426 --> 00:30:08.056
Alright. Here is your contract. It's
all electronic now. Just sign up there.

384
00:30:08.264 --> 00:30:11.643

00:30:14.771 --> 00:30:15.396
Sign it.

387
00:30:16.272 --> 00:30:20.527
Sign. Date. Initial.

388
00:30:21.986 --> 00:30:25.398
Alright. we're all set. and
I'll see you in Hell very soon.

389
00:30:25.448 --> 00:30:27.617
Not if I see you first. fuckers!

390
00:30:28.701 --> 00:30:30.236
The mouth on her.

391
00:30:30.286 --> 00:30:31.112
I love you.

392
00:30:31.162 --> 00:30:33.456
And I... really enjoy your company.

393
00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:34.874
Yay!

394
00:30:35.124 --> 00:30:36.918
I'm going to get drunk by myself now. so...

395
00:30:37.043 --> 00:30:37.836
Let's go.

396
00:30:38.086 --> 00:30:39.337
By myself.

397
00:30:39.671 --> 00:30:40.880
(empty bottles rattle)

398
00:30:48.096 --> 00:30:51.057

401
00:31:34.893 --> 00:31:37.854
(pumping nightclub music)

402
00:32:05.006 --> 00:32:07.967
(calm classical music)

403
00:32:30.073 --> 00:32:32.367
Did you drink all the milk again?

404
00:32:32.659 --> 00:32:34.786
It's not like you need all of it.

405
00:32:35.078 --> 00:32:37.955
Did you seriously eat all of these?

406
00:32:37.997 --> 00:32:38.915
Pig!

407
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:43.369
Well. my mom sent them for my birthday.
and I thought that just this once...

408
00:32:43.419 --> 00:32:46.706
See. this is why you're home
alone on a Saturday night...

409
00:32:46.756 --> 00:32:49.550
and I'm going out with whoever I want.

410
00:32:49.717 --> 00:32:51.761
Nobody wants a fatty.

411
00:32:52.095 --> 00:32:54.138
I wish you wouldn't say that.

412
00:32:56.516 --> 00:33:00.053
Just keep listening to
me. stop screwing up...

413
00:33:00.103 --> 00:33:03.022
and you'll have someone
to screw by the summer.

414
00:33:09.237 --> 00:33:11.739
So who's the lucky guy tonight?

415
00:33:14.033 --> 00:33:15.201
Alex?

416
00:33:15.618 --> 00:33:18.538
No. Been over him for weeks now.

417
00:33:18.955 --> 00:33:19.914
Jim?

418
00:33:20.498 --> 00:33:22.959
Nope. not this time.

419
00:33:23.418 --> 00:33:24.377
Jeremy?

420
00:33:25.253 --> 00:33:28.715
No! He's so out of rotation.

421
00:33:29.841 --> 00:33:31.050
I liked him

422
00:33:31.259 --> 00:33:32.719
He's out of your league.

423
00:33:34.929 --> 00:33:35.972
Kyle?

424
00:33:37.265 --> 00:33:38.266
Chris?

425
00:33:39.434 --> 00:33:40.435
Andrew?

426
00:33:41.978 --> 00:33:45.356
That weird foreign guy. Where was from?

427
00:33:45.815 --> 00:33:50.987
Oh. Mauricio. My Brazilian
powder puff of a man.

428
00:33:51.738 --> 00:33:53.614
I thought he was rather nice.

429
00:33:53.990 --> 00:34:00.621
Things were going well. I guess. but I need
a little more financial incentive there.

430
00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:04.435
My time doesn't come cheap
and there are so many others

431
00:34:04.495 --> 00:34:07.587
who make seeing them worth my while.

432
00:34:08.171 --> 00:34:13.176
He doesn't buy flowers.
gifts. jewelry. or anything!

433
00:34:14.469 --> 00:34:17.805
I need to know that my man is
willing to value me as I deserve.

434
00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:19.599
So it's over then?

435
00:34:20.641 --> 00:34:24.395
No. not yet. I told him I was
going out with Tom tonight..

436
00:34:24.645 --> 00:34:27.857
And if he really wants me back you
can put his money where his mouth is.

437
00:34:28.608 --> 00:34:33.112
So if he buys you something you'll take it
easy and just go out with him for awhile?

438
00:34:33.362 --> 00:34:37.108
Of course not. But I'll
stop rubbing it in his face...

439
00:34:37.158 --> 00:34:41.412
that I have a ton of guys ready
to party at any given minute.

440
00:34:44.916 --> 00:34:50.588
Just keep listening to me. stick to your
diet. and you can have two or three guys.

441
00:34:53.007 --> 00:34:53.966
Eventually

442
00:34:55.843 --> 00:34:58.096
I don't think I want that
many at any one time.

443
00:34:58.971 --> 00:35:01.307
(knock at door)

444
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:03.267
It's too early for that to be Tom.

445
00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:09.315
You know. if it's anyone else just tell
them I'm sick and I can't come to the door.

446
00:35:12.944 --> 00:35:14.904
{mysterious music}

447
00:35:15.446 --> 00:35:16.656
Can I help you?

448
00:35:16.781 --> 00:35:18.616
Are you Stephanie?

449
00:35:19.075 --> 00:35:21.994
No. she's... not feeling well.

450
00:35:22.245 --> 00:35:26.499
Oh. Well. I have a delivery
from a Mauricio del...

451
00:35:26.833 --> 00:35:30.545
See. Becky. What did I tell
you? It works every time.

452
00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:32.421
Are these Godiva chocolates?

453
00:35:32.713 --> 00:35:35.466
Something rare. A delicacy.

454
00:35:35.758 --> 00:35:38.427
I've never seen these in the U.S. before.

455
00:35:38.553 --> 00:35:42.723
Not too shabby then. What are
the flavors? Are there any fillings?

456
00:35:42.974 --> 00:35:45.935
Something wonderful and different.

457
00:35:46.435 --> 00:35:50.022
Although. you should
only eat one at a time.

458
00:35:50.481 --> 00:35:52.859
Especially for your size.

459
00:35:55.194 --> 00:36:00.199
Look. Bozo. you're here to deliver chocolates
not take some cheap shot at my weight.

460
00:36:00.908 --> 00:36:03.494
It's not like I'm Becky's size. here.

461
00:36:06.914 --> 00:36:09.500
Look. I'm sorry. She just doesn't get it.

462
00:36:09.625 --> 00:36:10.660
Ah. no need.

463
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:15.882
Pretty girls like her. they get a
few breaks from an old man like me.

464
00:36:16.382 --> 00:36:18.467
Someday her luck will run out.

465
00:36:18.759 --> 00:36:23.222
You tell her to be careful.
Heed the warning on this card.

466
00:36:23.681 --> 00:36:24.891
Thanks.

467
00:36:33.691 --> 00:36:37.394
Those are some interesting chocolates.

468
00:36:37.454 --> 00:36:41.691
That boy must have some
strong feelings towards her.

469
00:36:52.793 --> 00:36:55.338
Maybe you should listen that delivery guy.

470
00:36:55.796 --> 00:37:01.594
That weirdo? Something about
savoring life and going slow? No way.

471
00:37:02.303 --> 00:37:04.847
Well. what about maintaining a diet?

472
00:37:05.181 --> 00:37:07.558
When you look like me. you can have it all.

473
00:37:08.601 --> 00:37:10.186
What does it taste like?

474
00:37:11.187 --> 00:37:12.355
Heavenly!

475
00:37:13.356 --> 00:37:15.274
Kind of like a mint flavor.

476
00:37:17.985 --> 00:37:20.071
Kind of makes my tongue tingle.

477
00:37:20.655 --> 00:37:22.356
You going to read the card?

478
00:37:22.406 --> 00:37:23.866
No. you go ahead.

479
00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:27.787
I'll text him later and
thank him for his generosity.

480
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:38.289
"Dear Stephanie. it took some time but I
was able to get you the rarest delicacy..."

481
00:37:38.339 --> 00:37:43.552
I knew of from my hometown. You
may not think me worthy of your interest...

482
00:37:43.636 --> 00:37:47.514
but I believe that everyone
gets what they deserve in the end.

483
00:37:47.556 --> 00:37:51.135
This chocolate is not like
your average Hershey bar.

484
00:37:51.185 --> 00:37:56.315
It's filling contains the venom of a
nearly extinct snake from my homeland.

485
00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:59.652
Almost like the puffer fish from Japan.

486
00:37:59.735 --> 00:38:02.279
Small doses are a delicacy.

487
00:38:02.321 --> 00:38:05.533
Overindulgence is a grave error.

488
00:38:06.075 --> 00:38:09.946
It is such a shame you most
likely tossed this card into the trash.

489
00:38:09.996 --> 00:38:12.123
"Just like you did to my heart."

490
00:38:13.791 --> 00:38:16.752
(Stephanie gulps)

491
00:38:19.505 --> 00:38:22.466
(regurgitating sounds)

492
00:38:23.801 --> 00:38:26.762
(Stephanie gags. sputters)

493
00:38:47.241 --> 00:38:47.908
Huh.

494
00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:50.661
(phone rings)

495
00:38:54.206 --> 00:38:55.124
Hello?

496
00:38:55.333 --> 00:38:56.750
{calm classical music}

497
00:38:56.792 --> 00:39:00.379
Jeremy. How nice to hear from you.

498
00:39:01.839 --> 00:39:09.096
No. Stephanie can't come to the phone
right now. Um... She's not feeling well.

499
00:39:12.808 --> 00:39:15.644
Sure! Just give me a little bit.

500
00:39:15.978 --> 00:39:18.564
I'd love to go see a movie.

501
00:39:26.697 --> 00:39:29.658
{mysterious music}

502
00:39:35.581 --> 00:39:39.585
Anybody! Please. call the police! Anybody!

503
00:39:41.504 --> 00:39:43.964
(Flicker heads) Alice... Alice... Alice...

504
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:53.349
(Alice) Where is everybody?

505
00:39:56.602 --> 00:39:59.146
What the fuck are those things?

506
00:40:05.945 --> 00:40:06.779
HEY!

507
00:40:25.005 --> 00:40:27.341
(nearby laughter)

508
00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:29.510
(Woman 1) Disquiet!

509
00:40:30.177 --> 00:40:31.262
(Woman 2) Disregard.

510
00:40:31.512 --> 00:40:32.638
(Woman 3) Disabled.

511
00:40:32.805 --> 00:40:34.348
(Woman 1) Disappointing.

512
00:40:36.308 --> 00:40:37.435
(Alice) Help...

513
00:40:38.185 --> 00:40:39.186
Oh. Discord!

514
00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:40.688
Dissonance.

515
00:40:40.896 --> 00:40:42.106
Dissension.

516
00:40:42.731 --> 00:40:44.442
Please. call the police.

517
00:40:44.775 --> 00:40:45.651
Disheveled.

518
00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:47.027
Dispossessed.

519
00:40:47.069 --> 00:40:48.446
Discombobulated.

520
00:40:48.737 --> 00:40:52.992
They're coming. Three... I
actually don't know what they are.

521
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.326
Disinformation.

522
00:40:54.493 --> 00:40:55.619
Disreputable.

523
00:40:55.911 --> 00:40:57.288
Disambiguation.

524
00:40:57.705 --> 00:40:58.414
What?

525
00:40:58.831 --> 00:41:01.250
No! Somebody stole my phone.
We need to go some place safe.

526
00:41:01.625 --> 00:41:03.710
Oh. disillusioned.

527
00:41:03.752 --> 00:41:05.045
Dismayed.

528
00:41:05.254 --> 00:41:06.839
Disheartened.

529
00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:10.468
Stop it! Stop it! This is serious!

530
00:41:10.718 --> 00:41:12.010
Oh. disturbed.

531
00:41:12.052 --> 00:41:13.095
Ah! Distressed!

532
00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:14.638
Discontent!

533
00:41:14.763 --> 00:41:15.756
Ooh!

534
00:41:15.806 --> 00:41:17.099
What is wrong with you?

535
00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:20.561
Okay. Okay. Uh... Dis... Dis...

536
00:41:27.359 --> 00:41:28.736
...- truction?

537
00:41:30.571 --> 00:41:33.115
Disqualified!

538
00:41:34.116 --> 00:41:35.451
Dissatisfying.

539
00:41:35.576 --> 00:41:36.368
Dismal.

540
00:41:36.535 --> 00:41:38.623
- Disengage. - Would you shut the fuck up!

541
00:41:38.683 --> 00:41:40.664
Please. I know one of has a
phone. Let me call the police.

542
00:41:40.706 --> 00:41:41.748
Disgraceful.

543
00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:42.833
Disloyal.

544
00:41:42.917 --> 00:41:44.376
Dishonorable.

545
00:41:45.002 --> 00:41:46.253
What the hell?

546
00:41:48.589 --> 00:41:51.550
(rumbling)

547
00:41:57.264 --> 00:42:00.226
(snake-like hissing)

548
00:42:22.957 --> 00:42:27.294
{elegant classical music}

549
00:43:20.097 --> 00:43:23.058
(muffled thump)

550
00:43:47.458 --> 00:43:51.253
Mom. You're so beautiful.

551
00:44:02.181 --> 00:44:05.726
Oh. sweet pea. you're a big girl now.

552
00:44:05.809 --> 00:44:09.938
You can't sit on mom
anymore. You'll squish me.

553
00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:17.237
Am I gonna be a woman soon?

554
00:44:17.613 --> 00:44:18.906
Yes. sweet pea.

555
00:44:19.031 --> 00:44:22.659
You'll be grown up and one
day you'll have your own kids.

556
00:44:22.701 --> 00:44:27.456
And one day they'll be so big
they won't be able to sit on your lap.

557
00:44:32.211 --> 00:44:34.755
Will I be as pretty as you. mom?

558
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:41.970
You'll be even prettier.

559
00:44:44.014 --> 00:44:46.850
If I could only straighten your hair.

560
00:44:48.894 --> 00:44:53.023
That's it. I give up. What
have you been doing?

561
00:44:55.693 --> 00:44:58.404
I was playing outside with Rex.

562
00:45:00.364 --> 00:45:02.616
That explains the mud.

563
00:45:13.794 --> 00:45:16.755
{creepy music}

564
00:45:28.058 --> 00:45:33.439
Ow! It hurts mom. It's all tangled up.

565
00:45:34.606 --> 00:45:37.818
Start by brushing in the
bottom and work your way up.

566
00:45:38.819 --> 00:45:40.237
And gently.

567
00:45:42.531 --> 00:45:46.952
I wish I had your hair. It's
so much prettier than mine.

568
00:45:47.619 --> 00:45:50.080
I'll teach you how to take care of it.

569
00:45:55.961 --> 00:46:00.716
I want to be a mom... and a dad.

570
00:46:01.133 --> 00:46:03.427
Well. you can't be a dad. sweetness.

571
00:46:03.719 --> 00:46:04.636
Why not?

572
00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:11.435
Honey! Not so rough.

573
00:46:12.436 --> 00:46:14.229
I wish I had your lips. too.

574
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:18.245
One day you'll look in the mirror and

575
00:46:18.305 --> 00:46:21.320
you'll be so happy with
what you see. I promise.

576
00:46:22.946 --> 00:46:27.493
Olivia. stop it! You're so rough today.

577
00:46:30.412 --> 00:46:34.374
Where's your father? We'll
be late for our cocktail party.

578
00:46:34.666 --> 00:46:36.835
Ouch! Stop it!

579
00:46:39.213 --> 00:46:43.091
He and Tom took Rex out for a walk.

580
00:46:50.349 --> 00:46:53.936
Honey. give me those earrings back.

581
00:46:54.436 --> 00:46:55.270
No.

582
00:46:55.979 --> 00:47:02.277
They're mine now. You have so many.

583
00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:08.575
You can have them when we get
back from tonight. As a gift. Forever.

584
00:47:08.784 --> 00:47:11.537
But now those are still mommy's.

585
00:47:15.999 --> 00:47:17.042
Olivia?

586
00:47:18.418 --> 00:47:20.963
(Olivia hums creepy tune)

587
00:47:21.713 --> 00:47:23.006
Olivia?

588
00:47:28.971 --> 00:47:32.391
Olivia. do you hear me?

589
00:47:38.272 --> 00:47:39.857
(Olivia growls)

590
00:47:41.024 --> 00:47:43.527
What's up with you today?

591
00:47:57.207 --> 00:47:59.543
Go to your room.

592
00:47:59.918 --> 00:48:02.379
Olivia. go to your room!

593
00:48:12.014 --> 00:48:15.017
You know what I want. mom?

594
00:48:15.392 --> 00:48:20.606
Honey. put the scissors
down. That's very dangerous.

595
00:48:21.231 --> 00:48:23.358
I want your hair.

596
00:48:23.901 --> 00:48:25.944
This isn't funny. sweet pea.

597
00:48:27.529 --> 00:48:34.328
I try and I try. mom. but no matter
what I do it's never as pretty as yours.

598
00:48:34.703 --> 00:48:39.291
Olivia Sophie McArthur! You
stop this nonsense. RIGHT NOW!

599
00:48:40.208 --> 00:48:41.668
(snip)

600
00:48:45.422 --> 00:48:48.800
Look how shiny it is.

601
00:48:52.804 --> 00:48:55.724
How it flows in the air.

602
00:48:59.519 --> 00:49:00.771
It's wonderful.

603
00:49:09.571 --> 00:49:11.239
(door slams)

604
00:49:13.742 --> 00:49:17.245
But mommy... let's play.

605
00:49:20.457 --> 00:49:22.668
(screams)

606
00:49:25.462 --> 00:49:29.049
Hold still. I want more.

607
00:49:29.257 --> 00:49:31.009
I want all of it.

608
00:49:32.719 --> 00:49:34.805
I want your jacket. too.

609
00:49:35.347 --> 00:49:37.516
JACOB! JACOB!

610
00:49:38.725 --> 00:49:41.353
IN HERE. HELP ME!

611
00:49:41.937 --> 00:49:43.397
He can't help you. mom.

612
00:49:43.981 --> 00:49:45.232
TOM!

613
00:49:45.607 --> 00:49:47.651
Where are they?

614
00:49:48.443 --> 00:49:50.195
What have you done?

615
00:49:50.904 --> 00:49:53.699
I love you mom. And I want you...

616
00:49:54.157 --> 00:49:56.827
(in demonic voice) All to myself.

617
00:49:58.537 --> 00:50:01.873
Oh my God! I totally forgot.

618
00:50:01.957 --> 00:50:06.920
Your elegant. beautiful. amazing. long...

619
00:50:07.421 --> 00:50:08.171
FINGERS!

620
00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:09.840
(screams)

621
00:50:10.382 --> 00:50:13.301
NO!!! STOP!!! (screaming continues)

622
00:50:15.846 --> 00:50:16.446
(bone cracks)

623
00:50:18.348 --> 00:50:19.268
(bone crunch... SCREAM)

624
00:50:22.561 --> 00:50:23.353
(crack... SCREAM)

625
00:50:35.282 --> 00:50:37.200
(Mom's scream cut short)

626
00:50:38.785 --> 00:50:40.579
(Tom screams)

627
00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:51.882
(Olivia humming)

628
00:50:55.177 --> 00:50:58.138
(intense music)

629
00:51:01.391 --> 00:51:05.896
See. mama? I can still sit on your lap.

630
00:51:06.104 --> 00:51:07.606
I love you mom.

631
00:51:14.446 --> 00:51:15.655
You're mine.

632
00:51:17.365 --> 00:51:20.202
(in demonic voice) All mine!

633
00:51:28.043 --> 00:51:31.755
Mom? Mommy!

634
00:51:32.297 --> 00:51:33.423
Mommy???

635
00:51:36.968 --> 00:51:38.345
(SCREAM)

636
00:51:48.396 --> 00:51:50.023
(GUNSHOTS)

637
00:51:50.899 --> 00:51:52.901
(heartbeat)

638
00:51:53.485 --> 00:51:55.153
NO! God. no!

639
00:51:55.737 --> 00:51:57.072
I told him not to move!

640
00:51:57.531 --> 00:51:59.825
Stay with me. No! God no!

641
00:52:00.033 --> 00:52:03.161
I told him NOT TO MOVE!

642
00:52:04.454 --> 00:52:07.657
No! NO! NO!

643
00:52:07.707 --> 00:52:09.584
Why did you do that?

644
00:52:10.043 --> 00:52:11.670
No. baby no!

645
00:52:12.129 --> 00:52:14.631
Oh my God. NO!

646
00:52:14.965 --> 00:52:16.083
(heartbeat stops)

647
00:52:16.133 --> 00:52:19.761
What did you do?! WHAT DID YOU DO???

648
00:52:22.514 --> 00:52:26.134
We were pulled over for a broken taillight.

649
00:52:26.184 --> 00:52:30.021
My boyfriend went to get his
wallet. and the police shot him!

650
00:52:30.188 --> 00:52:32.482
I told him not to move.

651
00:52:32.774 --> 00:52:37.195
You told him to get his license and
registration. And that's what he was doing.

652
00:52:37.404 --> 00:52:39.823
I told him not to move.
He shouldn't have moved.

653
00:52:39.865 --> 00:52:40.824
That's it!

654
00:52:41.825 --> 00:52:43.160
(Mark talking on police radio)

655
00:52:43.451 --> 00:52:44.736
(sirens approaching)

656
00:52:44.786 --> 00:52:47.831
We're going to need
another unit for crowd control.

657
00:52:48.206 --> 00:52:51.251
I need you guys to back away from the
car. please. Just back away from the car.

658
00:52:51.293 --> 00:52:54.329
(woman) Did you seriously just shoot him?

659
00:52:54.379 --> 00:52:58.583
(woman) What the hell?
And here's more of them.

660
00:52:58.633 --> 00:53:01.261
Do you really need all these fucking cops?

661
00:53:04.097 --> 00:53:05.807
Why do you hate us so much?

662
00:53:05.974 --> 00:53:09.728
You always kill us every goddamn
chance you get. And get away with it!

663
00:53:10.103 --> 00:53:11.062
(crowd rages)

664
00:53:11.438 --> 00:53:14.816
GET OUT! GET OUT OF MY CRIME SCENE!

665
00:53:15.275 --> 00:53:18.403
(woman) Fucking coward!
Get your fucking hands off me.

666
00:53:20.822 --> 00:53:23.783
{Intense music builds}

667
00:53:32.167 --> 00:53:34.336
(man) He can't wait
to kill another minority!

668
00:53:39.049 --> 00:53:41.092
Get outta here! MOVE!

669
00:53:41.384 --> 00:53:43.929
(woman) How many times is
this going to fucking happen?

670
00:53:44.095 --> 00:53:46.714
(woman) The guy is laying
in his cold fucking blood.

671
00:53:46.774 --> 00:53:49.392
and you guys are here terrorizing us!

672
00:53:58.735 --> 00:54:00.854
Honest officer. it was an accident.

673
00:54:00.904 --> 00:54:04.357
My pants just fell down when I
was walking in front of those nuns.

674
00:54:04.407 --> 00:54:05.358
Three times?

675
00:54:05.408 --> 00:54:06.368
It was windy out.

676
00:54:06.451 --> 00:54:07.194
Go on.

677
00:54:07.244 --> 00:54:08.536
They were asking for it.

678
00:54:11.331 --> 00:54:12.199
(knocks)

679
00:54:12.249 --> 00:54:16.661
What's up big bro? Damn. They give
you the chief's office or something?

680
00:54:16.711 --> 00:54:19.506
I wish. You get the bathroom.

681
00:54:21.508 --> 00:54:23.969
What's the matter? Why the long face?

682
00:54:24.511 --> 00:54:31.643
They got me entering these BOLOs and personnel
orders until after the shooting clears.

683
00:54:31.893 --> 00:54:35.689
Frankly. it is fucking killing me.
I was not meant for desk duty.

684
00:54:35.897 --> 00:54:37.274
I know you weren't.

685
00:54:37.565 --> 00:54:38.733
(Mark) What's up?

686
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:42.612
Nothing. much man. You wanna
go grab some lunch? My treat.

687
00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:45.615
Yeah. Let's do it. Let me get my gun.

688
00:54:48.785 --> 00:54:49.694
What the hell?

689
00:54:49.744 --> 00:54:50.620
What's the matter?

690
00:54:53.790 --> 00:54:56.785
Some black fucking asshole
keeps screwing with me.

691
00:54:56.835 --> 00:54:58.378
Hey. man keep your voice down.

692
00:55:05.176 --> 00:55:08.930
What's going on. Mark. I don't see anyone.

693
00:55:09.347 --> 00:55:11.766
You good? Huh?

694
00:55:12.017 --> 00:55:12.851
Yeah.

695
00:55:13.143 --> 00:55:14.903
Alright. Come on. I'm
hungry. Let's go. man.

696
00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:19.557
(boxing and crowd sounds)

697
00:55:19.607 --> 00:55:22.569
So this one perp was
screaming he's innocent. right?

698
00:55:23.903 --> 00:55:25.405
Next thing you know...

699
00:55:25.947 --> 00:55:28.908
this guy's got a pound
of cocaine in his book bag.

700
00:55:30.368 --> 00:55:33.705
Just goes to show how stupid
those goddamn Mexicans are.

701
00:55:34.456 --> 00:55:36.479
You know you probably shouldn't
be heard saying anything like.

702
00:55:36.521 --> 00:55:38.835
At least until the trial's over. man.

703
00:55:39.002 --> 00:55:41.254
Eh. it's all bullshit. You know that.

704
00:55:43.798 --> 00:55:45.800
So what the hell happened out there anyway?

705
00:55:47.135 --> 00:55:51.389
You can read about it in the
report. I'm tired of telling the story.

706
00:55:54.601 --> 00:55:58.855
You know. you once told me not to do
anything that would jeopardize my career.

707
00:55:59.022 --> 00:56:00.273
You remember that?

708
00:56:03.401 --> 00:56:05.645
So what now? Is this you giving it back?

709
00:56:05.695 --> 00:56:07.447
That's what's going on?

710
00:56:07.822 --> 00:56:09.190
My little brother's gonna help me.

711
00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:11.242
What else should I be doing?

712
00:56:11.701 --> 00:56:16.498
Should I eat my vegetables?
Go to church? What's my curfew?

713
00:56:17.499 --> 00:56:20.785
I'm just saying there's a difference
between us and them. that's all.

714
00:56:20.835 --> 00:56:22.670
White people and everyone else.

715
00:56:23.088 --> 00:56:25.423
Crime statistics don't support that. man.

716
00:56:25.882 --> 00:56:28.134
Oh you did not just "crime statistics" me.

717
00:56:28.468 --> 00:56:30.475
Yeah. Every ethnic group
kills primarily their own.

718
00:56:30.517 --> 00:56:32.505
White people kill the most white people.

719
00:56:32.555 --> 00:56:34.507
Black people kill the most black people.

720
00:56:34.557 --> 00:56:35.800
Asians. Mexicans. and so on.

721
00:56:35.850 --> 00:56:37.316
You weren't crying that mess when the

722
00:56:37.358 --> 00:56:39.103
Mexican gang was
kicking the shit outta you.

723
00:56:39.145 --> 00:56:40.897
Oh come on. man. I was 15.

724
00:56:41.314 --> 00:56:44.526
So what? I was the one that had to
raise you when Mom and Dad died.

725
00:56:44.818 --> 00:56:46.603
I was the one that had to go intervene...

726
00:56:46.653 --> 00:56:51.241
every time some Africoon. wetback.
or chink gang was whooping your ass.

727
00:56:51.491 --> 00:56:56.329
It's like dad used to say. "All the animals
are in the zoo but they're separate".

728
00:56:56.788 --> 00:57:02.252
The lions are separate from the gorillas.
separate from the giraffes. the birds. etc.

729
00:57:02.627 --> 00:57:05.705
That's where we come in. We want
to make sure that somebody else's...

730
00:57:05.755 --> 00:57:10.552
crime statistics don't bleed over
into someone else's lion cage.

731
00:57:10.635 --> 00:57:15.890
It's only fair. We want to keep the
good white people with the white people...

732
00:57:15.932 --> 00:57:17.675
the blacks with the blacks. etc.

733
00:57:17.725 --> 00:57:19.269
I don't agree with that at all.

734
00:57:19.477 --> 00:57:21.980
We're out there to serve
and protect everyone. Mark.

735
00:57:22.147 --> 00:57:23.565
You are not that naive.

736
00:57:23.982 --> 00:57:26.601
All police departments racially profile.

737
00:57:26.651 --> 00:57:28.986
Don't tell me that you're driving down
the street in the middle of the night...

738
00:57:29.028 --> 00:57:32.198
you see some black guy walking
through some white neighborhood.

739
00:57:32.323 --> 00:57:35.944
You look at it and you go that is out
of place. You stop. You investigate...

740
00:57:35.994 --> 00:57:38.496
and that's how we find things.

741
00:57:39.372 --> 00:57:41.207
(Brian) Well off the record...

742
00:57:42.083 --> 00:57:45.044
did you kill that black guy on purpose?

743
00:57:47.672 --> 00:57:49.340
What do you think?

744
00:57:49.549 --> 00:57:54.053
I don't know. Mark. I don't know. man.

745
00:57:57.223 --> 00:57:58.475
You tell me.

746
00:58:00.643 --> 00:58:03.855
I guess you can just
read about it in the report.

747
00:58:05.815 --> 00:58:09.944
You know like. it doesn't even matter.

748
00:58:10.904 --> 00:58:15.533
These Africoons are going around killing
each other by the hundreds every year...

749
00:58:15.742 --> 00:58:20.872
And what? You're... you're gonna
jump my shit for doing my job?

750
00:58:21.289 --> 00:58:23.458
But that guy wasn't a criminal.

751
00:58:23.791 --> 00:58:30.340
THAT'S NOT YOUR CALL TO MAKE!
It was mine! I was on scene. not you!

752
00:58:31.007 --> 00:58:33.573
He wasn't following my orders.

753
00:58:33.633 --> 00:58:35.928
How was I supposed to know
that he's going for some papers...

754
00:58:35.970 --> 00:58:40.175
and not a gun? It was my call to make.

755
00:58:40.225 --> 00:58:43.144
I was on scene. Not you.

756
00:58:46.356 --> 00:58:48.358
Look man. I'm just trying to...

757
00:58:48.566 --> 00:58:54.405
Stop. What I would like
is to finish my dinner...

758
00:58:55.156 --> 00:58:59.452
drink my drink and watch the
rest of the fight... with my brother.

759
00:58:59.786 --> 00:59:05.583
But this. This conversation.
It's over. We're done.

760
00:59:12.006 --> 00:59:16.094
Well. I got to admit it's getting
late. I think I'm gonna take off.

761
00:59:20.723 --> 00:59:22.483
Oh. am I gonna see you
tomorrow at the task force

762
00:59:22.525 --> 00:59:24.477
or are you going to be riding that desk.

763
00:59:24.727 --> 00:59:27.313
I'll be there. Off the
books. but I'll be there.

764
00:59:27.605 --> 00:59:28.356
Alright.

765
00:59:33.528 --> 00:59:36.698
(Brian) Can you handle
this? I gotta take a piss.

766
00:59:51.504 --> 00:59:53.748
Whoa. I know you homie!

767
00:59:53.798 --> 00:59:56.876
You're that fucking racist cop
that pop pop pop that black guy.

768
00:59:56.926 --> 00:59:58.878
What did you just say to me?

769
00:59:58.928 --> 01:00:00.179
I said you're that racist cop...

770
01:00:00.221 --> 01:00:01.347
Get over here you fucking fruit-picker.

771
01:00:01.389 --> 01:00:02.340
Hey. fuck you vato!

772
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:03.182
Turn around.

773
01:00:03.224 --> 01:00:04.141
Why. so you can shoot me in the back. too?

774
01:00:04.183 --> 01:00:05.393
- Turn around! - Motherfucker!

775
01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.812
What the fuck is wrong with
you. rolling up on me like that?

776
01:00:07.854 --> 01:00:10.414
Oh. you're a tough guy when you
have a gun and no one else does.

777
01:00:10.648 --> 01:00:11.816
Is that right? IS THAT RIGHT?

778
01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:15.153
You want a gun? YOU WANT A FUCKING GUN?

779
01:00:23.911 --> 01:00:26.456
You wanted it. There it is.

780
01:00:27.582 --> 01:00:28.791
Do something.

781
01:00:29.375 --> 01:00:32.754
Do something. Be a man.

782
01:00:33.796 --> 01:00:35.632
PICK UP THE GUN. YOU PIECE OF SHIT!

783
01:00:35.757 --> 01:00:36.874
I don't want to. ese.

784
01:00:36.924 --> 01:00:40.887
Yes you do. You know
you want it. Do it! DO IT!

785
01:00:43.723 --> 01:00:45.350
It's empty!

786
01:00:46.476 --> 01:00:47.393
Odelay.

787
01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:50.355
You fucked up. Holmes.

788
01:00:50.605 --> 01:00:51.773
Hey hey hey...

789
01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:54.692
You fucked up!

790
01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:58.279
(GUNSHOTS)

791
01:01:03.701 --> 01:01:05.662
(GUNSHOTS)

792
01:01:09.415 --> 01:01:11.042
Mark. you alright?

793
01:01:13.044 --> 01:01:14.671
(GUNSHOTS)

794
01:01:17.590 --> 01:01:18.190
NO!

795
01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:22.303
Brian! No. Brian!

796
01:01:31.312 --> 01:01:31.912
Why?

797
01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:37.110
Why? Why did you do that?

798
01:01:58.881 --> 01:02:00.758
(siren)

799
01:02:04.804 --> 01:02:06.556
Shots fired. Officer down.

800
01:02:07.223 --> 01:02:08.516
Send units code.

801
01:02:10.643 --> 01:02:12.520
(police radio chatter)

802
01:02:14.939 --> 01:02:15.648
Damn!

803
01:02:20.987 --> 01:02:22.155
What did you find?

804
01:02:23.614 --> 01:02:26.284
Nothing. The alley's all clear.

805
01:02:27.034 --> 01:02:29.412
What? How can the alley be clear?

806
01:02:31.706 --> 01:02:36.294
There's no one there. Not a goddamn thing.

807
01:02:36.711 --> 01:02:40.006
Well. who shot them and what
the hell were they aiming at?

808
01:02:40.548 --> 01:02:41.924
Beats the hell out of me.

809
01:02:42.425 --> 01:02:43.301
Come on. man!

810
01:03:00.359 --> 01:03:02.945
They don't have any surviving family.

811
01:03:03.237 --> 01:03:04.906
Mark was a good officer.

812
01:03:05.323 --> 01:03:07.909
He was no angel. but he was a good cop.

813
01:03:08.242 --> 01:03:10.328
True. But between you and me...

814
01:03:13.247 --> 01:03:15.208
He was a racist son of a bitch.

815
01:03:15.416 --> 01:03:17.335
What are you talking about?

816
01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:21.789
He had a black partner
back in 2000. Uhm... Johnson.

817
01:03:21.839 --> 01:03:24.258
One time they were in
pursuit of a robbery suspect.

818
01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:26.969
Guy runs into a building.
Johnson goes after him.

819
01:03:27.345 --> 01:03:30.473
Mark decides to stay
behind and wait for backup.

820
01:03:31.057 --> 01:03:33.851
Johnson goes in by himself without back up.

821
01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:35.928
Winds up getting shot and killed.

822
01:03:35.978 --> 01:03:39.273
Doesn't make any sense. Why
would he not backup his own partner?

823
01:03:39.357 --> 01:03:42.735
He said it was too dangerous and he
claimed that he was waiting for backup.

824
01:03:42.944 --> 01:03:44.645
But I'm saying that the real reason...

825
01:03:44.695 --> 01:03:47.949
is that he wasn't going to
risk his life for a black partner.

826
01:03:48.115 --> 01:03:51.118
Or a Mexican one. or an Asian one.

827
01:03:51.828 --> 01:03:53.287
Anything new on the shooter?

828
01:03:53.454 --> 01:03:54.330
Nothing yet.

829
01:03:54.622 --> 01:03:58.125
No witnesses and
forensics has turned up zilch.

830
01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:02.213
You'll always be remembered. brother.

831
01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:07.093
Rest in peace. We have to watch from here.

832
01:04:08.636 --> 01:04:10.847
(eerie music)

833
01:04:34.495 --> 01:04:37.665

Disoriented.

840
01:05:38.851 --> 01:05:40.394
Disoriented.

841
01:05:41.228 --> 01:05:42.813
Displaced.

842
01:05:43.105 --> 01:05:44.815
Disheartened.

843
01:05:57.328 --> 01:06:00.289

the warning on this card.

881
01:09:39.008 --> 01:09:40.467
Disappointing.

(thunderous ambient noise)

884
01:10:05.326 --> 01:10:06.869
The fuck just happened?

885
01:10:09.038 --> 01:10:10.539
The fuck...?

886
01:10:20.925 --> 01:10:23.886

(Fury HOWLS)

888
01:10:37.399 --> 01:10:39.068
I dispel negative energy.

889
01:10:40.819 --> 01:10:42.821
I invite good energy.

890
01:10:43.781 --> 01:10:45.908
I am calm. I am...

894

898
01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:03.068

900
01:12:11.535 --> 01:12:14.371
(Jack) Sophie! I heard you.

901
01:12:14.455 --> 01:12:16.707
(Jack) What the hell
you doing? Open the door.

902
01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:20.502
Go away. Jack. I'm getting
dressed. I'm not gonna open the door.

903
01:12:20.961 --> 01:12:25.132
(Jack) Bullshit! Come on. open now.

904
01:12:25.424 --> 01:12:27.468
Were you... Were you praying?

905

(Disembodied Voices)
Witches can also be men.

906
01:12:29.928 --> 01:12:32.056
No. of course not.

907
01:12:32.973 --> 01:12:37.686
I was just talking to myself.
That's what you heard.

908
01:12:38.896 --> 01:12:42.775
Yeah right. You can do whatever you want.

909
01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:46.653
I just thought you learned
something from mom and dad.

910
01:12:46.904 --> 01:12:48.030
(Voices) See?

911
01:12:48.238 --> 01:12:48.906
Leave!

912
01:12:50.115 --> 01:12:51.825

Hey!

915

(Voices) Ignore him.

916
01:13:27.778 --> 01:13:31.407
Come on. come back. I want to talk to you.

917
01:13:33.742 --> 01:13:37.662
What? Look Jack. I don't
want to talk about it. I wasn't...

918
01:13:37.704 --> 01:13:39.498
(Voices) Do not deny it.

919
01:13:39.832 --> 01:13:42.626
I'm not an idiot Sophie.
I know what I heard.

920
01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:45.963
Plus you've been acting
kinda weird lately. Just admit it.

921
01:13:47.339 --> 01:13:49.216
You want me to admit it?

922
01:13:49.716 --> 01:13:54.847
Fine! Yes. I was praying.
Okay. are you happy now?

923
01:13:55.013 --> 01:13:56.390
What's wrong with that?

924
01:13:56.598 --> 01:13:58.559
No. Nothing's wrong with that.

925
01:13:59.017 --> 01:14:01.603
I don't know. it's just very unlike you.

926
01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:03.647
(Voices) No need to explain.

927
01:14:03.814 --> 01:14:05.524
You know nothing about me.

928
01:14:05.774 --> 01:14:08.110
Sophie. come on. You're my sister.

929
01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:11.155
Look. I'm sorry about
earlier. It was a joke.

930
01:14:14.992 --> 01:14:18.662
No one in this family has ever shown
any interest in this kind of shi... thing.

931
01:14:19.204 --> 01:14:22.374
And now what? All of a sudden
you're a devout Christian? Catholic?

932
01:14:22.416 --> 01:14:24.835
Oh God. please don't
tell me Jehovah's Witness.

933
01:14:25.127 --> 01:14:26.878
(Voices) Heresy!

934
01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:29.631
Things have changed. I've changed.

935
01:14:29.882 --> 01:14:33.085
Okay. cool. So it's Jehovah's Witness huh?

936
01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:34.845
Listen you fucking asshole...

937
01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:39.600
It's none of your business. And even
if I told you. you wouldn't understand.

938
01:14:39.975 --> 01:14:44.438
Seriously? Okay. so help me understand.

939
01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:47.023
All jokes aside I'm worried about you.

940
01:14:47.065 --> 01:14:48.900
I've heard you before.
This isn't the first time.

941
01:14:48.942 --> 01:14:50.360
So now you're spying on me?

942
01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:53.989
Sophie. you're not listening
to me. Stop being so dramatic.

943
01:14:54.114 --> 01:14:56.729
I just want to know
why you're acting like this.

944
01:14:56.789 --> 01:14:59.403
What was that reaction?
I'm your brother. I...

945
01:14:59.453 --> 01:15:01.705
(Sophie's Voice and Other
Voices merge) ENOUGH!

946
01:15:04.082 --> 01:15:05.751
What was that?

947
01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:08.795

952
01:15:35.239 --> 01:15:43.239
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. You
were right. It's none of my business.

953
01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:48.126
There's nothing wrong with
religion. praying. any of it.

954

Did you just say something?

955

It was Sophie!

959

Forgive me Father. I have sinned.

983
01:18:32.457 --> 01:18:35.168
Did you make it look like an accident?

984
01:18:36.753 --> 01:18:38.880
Yes. I did.

985
01:18:39.798 --> 01:18:43.719
(Priest) Then all will
be forgiven my child.

986
01:18:44.177 --> 01:18:46.513
Has my debt been repaid?

987
01:18:47.013 --> 01:18:50.517
Not quite. You have one more.

988
01:18:51.184 --> 01:18:55.689
No. I don't know if I can do it anymore.

989
01:18:56.148 --> 01:18:59.776
My dear. remember our arrangement.

990
01:19:00.152 --> 01:19:05.657
I know. but I didn't know
it was gonna be so many.

991
01:19:06.491 --> 01:19:09.369
Your mother committed a mortal sin.

992
01:19:09.703 --> 01:19:14.416
If she were to be forgiven. it
would only be through your efforts.

993
01:19:15.459 --> 01:19:17.085
By killing people.

994
01:19:17.711 --> 01:19:22.758
By helping marked souls
find their way to the afterlife.

995
01:19:23.467 --> 01:19:25.844
No. No more. I can't.

996
01:19:26.344 --> 01:19:30.098
You must. If you want to help your mother.

997
01:19:30.599 --> 01:19:35.520
She made her choice. I
cannot help her anymore.

998
01:19:36.188 --> 01:19:38.857
So you have made yours.

999
01:19:42.319 --> 01:19:45.322
But I still need... one more.

Hello?

(Brandy) Hey sis! Thanks so
much for putting this together.

1021
01:26:34.022 --> 01:26:36.440
(Brandy) You would not
believe traffic on the way over.

1022
01:26:36.482 --> 01:26:37.475
Can I help you?

1023
01:26:37.525 --> 01:26:40.687
(Brandy) You can help me dig
into whatever cake you got in there.

1024
01:26:40.737 --> 01:26:42.280
(Brandy) Is everyone already inside?

1025
01:26:42.572 --> 01:26:45.200
How do you know what
we're doing here tonight?

1026
01:26:45.658 --> 01:26:49.120
(Brandy) I think I'd remember
my own birthday party.

1029
01:26:55.251 --> 01:27:00.798
(Brandy) Susan? What's wrong? Was
it supposed to be a surprise? I'm sorry.

1030
01:27:03.468 --> 01:27:06.107
I don't know who you are. or
what kind of sick game this is.

1031
01:27:06.167 --> 01:27:08.806
but you need to leave right now.

1032
01:27:09.265 --> 01:27:12.644
(Brandy) But... but it's
me. Why are you doing this?

1033
01:27:12.852 --> 01:27:16.481
Don't you think I know what my
own sister looks like. you stupid bitch?

1034
01:27:16.648 --> 01:27:17.940
(Mom) What's going on out there?

1035
01:27:17.982 --> 01:27:19.817
Nothing. I'll take care of it.

1036
01:27:19.984 --> 01:27:21.365
(Brandy) Mom. help!
Susan doesn't recognize me.

1037
01:27:21.407 --> 01:27:22.778
I think she might need
to go to the hospital.

1038
01:27:22.820 --> 01:27:26.241
GET OUT! I'm calling the police right now.

1039
01:27:26.532 --> 01:27:27.784
(door slams)

1040
01:27:29.577 --> 01:27:31.788
(Brandy) Where's my phone?

1041
01:27:32.872 --> 01:27:34.040
(car door closes)

1042
01:27:36.417 --> 01:27:37.377
(Brandy) Dad?

1043
01:27:37.877 --> 01:27:41.122
(Brandy) Oh my God.
I'm so glad you're here.

1044
01:27:41.172 --> 01:27:44.008
(Brandy) Susan won't let me in
and it's like she doesn't recognize me.

1045
01:27:44.217 --> 01:27:45.802
Excuse me. do I know you?

1046
01:27:46.094 --> 01:27:47.971
(Brandy) What? How can you...

1047
01:27:48.846 --> 01:27:51.099
You must be one of Brandy's friends.

1048
01:27:51.724 --> 01:27:55.303
I don't mean to be rude it's just
that under the circumstances...

1049
01:27:55.353 --> 01:27:59.899
I didn't think that Susan would be
inviting over anybody outside of family.

1050
01:28:00.525 --> 01:28:04.279
Anyway. I'm Brandy's father.

1051
01:28:06.197 --> 01:28:11.077
Was. Was her father.

1052
01:28:12.578 --> 01:28:13.413
Dammit.

1053
01:28:15.039 --> 01:28:15.707
Fuck!

1054
01:28:16.124 --> 01:28:18.543
(Brandy) It's... It's
okay. Nice to meet you.

1055
01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:23.256
How did you know Brandy. anyway?

1056
01:28:23.506 --> 01:28:26.759
(Brandy) Uh... We acted
together at Sacred Fools.

1057
01:28:26.884 --> 01:28:30.388
Another actress. Boy.
she sure loved that theater.

1058
01:28:30.888 --> 01:28:31.514
Dad.

1059
01:28:33.016 --> 01:28:34.142
Dad. come inside.

1060
01:28:35.268 --> 01:28:37.020
This crazy bitch thinks she's Brandy.

1061
01:28:37.478 --> 01:28:38.078
What?

1062
01:28:38.354 --> 01:28:39.230
Come inside!

1063
01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:42.859
(Brandy) No. no no.
Please. let me explain. Please.

1064
01:28:44.777 --> 01:28:45.377
Get out!

1065
01:28:45.528 --> 01:28:47.154
(Brandy) You have to
listen! Please! It's really me!

1066
01:28:47.196 --> 01:28:48.781
I'll break your goddamn foot!

1067
01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:50.867
(bone cracks)

1068
01:28:51.576 --> 01:28:53.619
(Brandy) AH! AH! AH!

1069
01:28:55.204 --> 01:28:57.248
(Brandy) Why'd you do that?

1070
01:28:59.334 --> 01:29:02.337
(Brandy) Don't you recognize me? Ahhh!

1071
01:29:02.795 --> 01:29:04.589
{crazy music}

1072
01:29:09.635 --> 01:29:13.473
(Brandy) What? What's this? What is this?

1073
01:29:14.098 --> 01:29:15.767
Memories of our daughter.

1074
01:29:16.142 --> 01:29:17.310
(Brandy) Why?

1075
01:29:18.603 --> 01:29:22.273
She disappeared. A year ago.

1076
01:29:22.857 --> 01:29:26.978
We never found her. so we just wanted
to celebrate her birthday one last time.

1077
01:29:27.028 --> 01:29:28.946
(Brandy) But I'm right here!

1078
01:29:32.950 --> 01:29:37.955
(Brandy) This! This is
me. Brandy! Your daughter.

1079
01:29:38.915 --> 01:29:39.832
(Brandy) See!

1080
01:29:44.670 --> 01:29:46.839
No. No no no no.

1081
01:29:47.799 --> 01:29:50.551
This isn't my face. Something must have...

1082
01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:51.344
(crowbar swings... hits)

1083
01:29:51.386 --> 01:29:52.553
(Brandy) Ahhh!

1084
01:29:56.432 --> 01:29:58.976
(family yelling) (Brandy crying out)

1085
01:29:59.894 --> 01:30:00.937
(Dad) Monster!

1086
01:30:15.827 --> 01:30:16.911
(flesh and bone snap)

1087
01:30:17.495 --> 01:30:19.414
(Brandy's head rolls)

1088
01:30:19.997 --> 01:30:20.997
(Brandy) What the fuck???

1089
01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:23.084
(Brandy) My fucking head popped off!

1090
01:30:25.169 --> 01:30:27.130
(Brandy) What did you guys do to me?

1091
01:30:28.339 --> 01:30:32.718
(Brandy) Wait. I think I just figured
out why you guys are confused.

1092
01:30:33.386 --> 01:30:36.305
(Brandy) Yeah. it's all coming back now.

1093
01:30:36.514 --> 01:30:39.851
(Brandy) I may have gotten
into a smudge of devil worship.

1094
01:30:40.059 --> 01:30:42.174
(Brandy) I think I sold my
soul for some more acting ability

1095
01:30:42.216 --> 01:30:44.313
or something crazy like that.

1096
01:30:44.730 --> 01:30:45.481
(Brandy) Oops!

1097
01:30:46.524 --> 01:30:48.609
(Brandy) You guys are
okay with that. right?

1098
01:30:48.943 --> 01:30:49.543
Uh huh.

1099
01:30:49.652 --> 01:30:50.445
Yeah. of course.

1100
01:30:50.653 --> 01:30:51.153
Sure.

1101
01:30:51.195 --> 01:30:52.321
Absolutely. honey.

1102
01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:55.324
(Brandy) Sorry. it just slipped my mind.

1103
01:30:55.616 --> 01:30:58.661
(Brandy) Now things are gonna go
back to the way they were. Right?

1104
01:30:58.870 --> 01:31:00.510
(Family) Yes! Right! Uh huh! Absolutely!

1105
01:31:00.913 --> 01:31:04.041
(Brandy) I'm still Brandy. Got it?

1106
01:31:04.333 --> 01:31:05.751
Of course. yeah.

1107
01:31:05.835 --> 01:31:06.869
(Brandy) Good!

1108
01:31:06.919 --> 01:31:08.371
{happy music}

1109
01:31:08.421 --> 01:31:10.548
(Brandy) Now tell me you
love me no matter what.

1110
01:31:10.590 --> 01:31:12.425
We... we... we love you...

1111
01:31:12.633 --> 01:31:15.845
(Brandy) Take it! And
say it like you mean it.

1112
01:31:15.887 --> 01:31:17.054
(icky squish)

1113
01:31:17.555 --> 01:31:21.684
We love you. No matter what.

1114
01:31:22.143 --> 01:31:24.679
(Brandy) Thank you! Thank you so much!

1115
01:31:24.729 --> 01:31:27.440
(Brandy) This is everything I'd hoped for!

1116
01:31:33.779 --> 01:31:35.823
{violin music}

1117
01:31:35.907 --> 01:31:38.993
(Penny) I done bailing
your dumb ass out of jail.

1118
01:31:39.243 --> 01:31:40.953
It was an accident. It was windy out.

1119
01:31:41.037 --> 01:31:43.706
Oh shut up! You and your nun boner.

1120
01:31:43.789 --> 01:31:45.875
Makes this whole operation look bad.

1121
01:31:46.250 --> 01:31:48.669
And take this shit off. This is offensive.

1122
01:31:48.836 --> 01:31:50.455
It's funny. We're demons.

1123
01:31:50.505 --> 01:31:52.465
I'm a demon. but I'm woke.

1124
01:31:52.632 --> 01:31:54.634
(Alice) Help! Please! Help me.

1125
01:31:54.926 --> 01:31:55.718
Oh God.

1126
01:31:56.052 --> 01:31:57.720
Oh. it's a motivated seller.

1127
01:31:58.596 --> 01:32:01.382
Yeah. no. She's not ours. Ignore her.

1128
01:32:01.432 --> 01:32:02.808
"Not ours" as in what?

1129
01:32:03.142 --> 01:32:05.770
As in hands-off. "Sister Act".

1130
01:32:06.062 --> 01:32:07.054
Make an egress.

1131
01:32:07.104 --> 01:32:08.431
Make a... What the fuck?

1132
01:32:08.481 --> 01:32:10.650
Remember when you
used to work for me and...

1133
01:32:11.025 --> 01:32:12.568
Egress. Now!

1134
01:32:12.818 --> 01:32:14.237
Make you make an egress.

1135
01:32:15.571 --> 01:32:17.315
Please call the police.

1136
01:32:17.365 --> 01:32:19.025
I'm being chased by these...

1137
01:32:19.075 --> 01:32:20.409
and the women with the...

1138
01:32:20.826 --> 01:32:22.411
Please. call the police.

1139
01:32:22.745 --> 01:32:25.323
Yeah. sorry lady. It's not our department.

1140
01:32:25.373 --> 01:32:26.874
Try the next floor.

1141
01:32:27.375 --> 01:32:30.962
Next what? Come on! Come
on! Why is this happening?

1142
01:32:31.504 --> 01:32:34.340
(Penny) Don't ask the questions
if you don't want the answers.

1143
01:32:34.799 --> 01:32:36.092
What does that mean?

1144
01:32:36.217 --> 01:32:38.302
What the hell does this shit even mean?

1145
01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:41.180
Poor little Alice.

1146
01:32:43.015 --> 01:32:45.718
(surreal explosion)

1147
01:32:45.768 --> 01:32:49.730
(Penny) Poor little
Alice fell down the hole...

1148
01:32:49.855 --> 01:32:53.526
(Penny) Bumped her
head. and bruised her soul

1149
01:32:55.319 --> 01:32:56.737
(cough)

1150
01:33:11.294 --> 01:33:14.255
{creepy music}

1151
01:33:19.885 --> 01:33:22.680
(Flicker heads) Alice... Alice...

1152
01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:30.563
Alice...

1153
01:33:36.986 --> 01:33:41.073
Alice... Alice... Alice...

1154
01:33:49.332 --> 01:33:52.293
{pounding dramatic music}

1155
01:33:56.505 --> 01:33:57.923
(metal scrapes)

1156
01:34:12.104 --> 01:34:14.315
(Alice SCREAMS)

1157
01:34:17.568 --> 01:34:20.321
(haunting echoes)

1158
01:34:46.764 --> 01:34:54.764
(many voices slowed down)

1159
01:34:58.275 --> 01:35:02.446
(many screams slowed down)

1160
01:35:05.074 --> 01:35:08.035
(Olivia) Mommy? Mommy?

1161
01:35:12.498 --> 01:35:15.201
(Red Woman) "Midway
along the journey of our life..."

1162
01:35:15.251 --> 01:35:17.953
"I woke to find myself in a dark wood..."

1163
01:35:18.003 --> 01:35:20.297
"for I had wandered
from the straight path."

1164
01:35:25.386 --> 01:35:29.098
Interesting how it changes from
plural to singular in the same sentence.

1165
01:35:30.433 --> 01:35:32.017
Or am I misreading that?

1166
01:35:35.813 --> 01:35:40.526
Listen lady. I have about
had it with all this crazy shit.

1167
01:35:40.609 --> 01:35:44.071
So just give me my phone
and I won't have to hurt you.

1168
01:35:44.613 --> 01:35:47.366
Oh. Alice. You can't hurt me anymore.

1169
01:35:48.492 --> 01:35:49.785
You don't know me.

1170
01:35:52.288 --> 01:35:55.916
Midway along the
journey of OUR life. Alice.

1171
01:35:56.792 --> 01:36:01.172
(whispered voices)
Alice... Alice... Alice...

1172
01:36:01.964 --> 01:36:03.799
STOP IT! JUST STOP IT!!!

1173
01:36:04.467 --> 01:36:06.218
Time to wake up.

1174
01:36:06.302 --> 01:36:08.929
Time to come out of the forest.

1175
01:36:09.597 --> 01:36:11.849
No! No. this is not real!

1176
01:36:12.183 --> 01:36:14.018
Time to atone.

1177
01:36:18.022 --> 01:36:19.231
What are you?

1178
01:36:21.984 --> 01:36:23.611
Everything you could have been.

1179
01:36:25.654 --> 01:36:26.864
(other Alice voices) I was
going to be a crisis counselor.

1180
01:36:26.906 --> 01:36:28.282
(other Alice voices) I was going to
tap dance on all seven continents.

1181
01:36:28.324 --> 01:36:29.616
(other Alice voices) I was going
to create the perfect dating app.

1182
01:36:29.658 --> 01:36:31.034
(other Alice voices) I was going to
volunteer for Habitat for Humanity.

1183
01:36:31.076 --> 01:36:32.369
(other Alice voices) I was going to
drive an ice cream truck / book mobile.

1184
01:36:32.411 --> 01:36:34.037
(other Alice voices) I was
going to be a public defender.

1185
01:36:34.079 --> 01:36:36.719
(other Alice voices) I was going
to negotiate U.N. peace treaties.

1186
01:36:37.666 --> 01:36:40.002
And I wanted to be a teacher.

1187
01:36:40.711 --> 01:36:42.880
(Alice laughs)

1188
01:36:45.049 --> 01:36:46.425
This isn't real.

1189
01:36:46.842 --> 01:36:50.129
But you threw us in the deep. deep dark...

1190
01:36:50.179 --> 01:36:53.140
so you could bask in
the light of the real world.

1191
01:36:53.432 --> 01:36:59.355
This isn't... No. I crashed and I
am unconscious on the freeway.

1192
01:36:59.563 --> 01:37:01.815
You don't get off that easy.

1193
01:37:01.857 --> 01:37:04.527
You betrayed us. And for what?

1194
01:37:05.986 --> 01:37:07.071
(boyfriend voice) Alice...

1195
01:37:08.864 --> 01:37:10.032
(mom voice) Alice...

1196
01:37:12.535 --> 01:37:14.286
(boss' voice) Ms. Durante...

1197
01:37:18.624 --> 01:37:20.209
You sold us out to them.

1198
01:37:20.626 --> 01:37:22.711
A company that makes useless junk.

1199
01:37:23.128 --> 01:37:25.506
A family that doesn't respect you.

1200
01:37:25.881 --> 01:37:30.010
A man that treats you like garbage.

1201
01:37:31.262 --> 01:37:31.971
Yes.

1202
01:37:32.930 --> 01:37:33.556
YES!

1203
01:37:34.473 --> 01:37:38.185
Because that's real life. And you are not.

1204
01:37:38.894 --> 01:37:42.940
You are little girl dreams. Teenage dreams.

1205
01:37:43.065 --> 01:37:46.402
You were never going to come true. EVER!!!

1206
01:37:46.569 --> 01:37:47.611
Why not?

1207
01:37:47.862 --> 01:37:49.864
Because dreams are HARD!

1208
01:37:53.909 --> 01:37:56.287
And trying is scary. and...

1209
01:37:58.122 --> 01:38:00.124
and failing hurts!

1210
01:38:03.794 --> 01:38:04.461
And...

1211
01:38:05.045 --> 01:38:09.216
I am done. With whatever this is.

1212
01:38:09.633 --> 01:38:13.295
Hallucination. Ghost of
Christmas Whatever-the-Fuck.

1213
01:38:13.345 --> 01:38:14.722
I don't care!

1214
01:38:15.514 --> 01:38:19.518
I am going back to my
real world. RIGHT NOW!

1215
01:38:24.565 --> 01:38:25.733
Fine.

1216
01:38:26.066 --> 01:38:27.860
Fine. I'll do it. I'll do it.

1217
01:38:27.943 --> 01:38:31.063
The ice cream and the world peace.

1218
01:38:31.113 --> 01:38:32.865
Everything. I'll do all of it.

1219
01:38:33.032 --> 01:38:36.076
First thing in the morning.

1220
01:38:36.785 --> 01:38:38.662
Just give me my phone...

1221
01:38:39.038 --> 01:38:41.665
and let me go home.

1222
01:38:47.004 --> 01:38:47.713
Alright.

1223
01:38:48.839 --> 01:38:52.426
Let me just take one selfie first.

1224
01:38:53.928 --> 01:38:56.013
(wrench crashes)

1225
01:38:57.181 --> 01:39:01.769
(roaring flames. weird chorus singing)

1226
01:39:11.278 --> 01:39:12.363
(phone clatters)

1227
01:39:14.073 --> 01:39:17.034
{intense abstract music}

1228
01:39:31.924 --> 01:39:33.634
{music ends}

1229
01:39:36.178 --> 01:39:38.013
(birds singing)

1230
01:39:42.977 --> 01:39:45.771
