to bring public concern against BioPrime.

345
00:19:44.625 --> 00:19:47.000
but I do not have enough
to take them down.

346

Family. human interest.
That's what grabs headlines.

352
00:20:01.291 --> 00:20:02.916
We can blow this thing wide open.

353
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.500
We can take down BioPrime.
We can bring Simon Keeley to his knees.

-[birds singing]
-[sirens wailing in distance]

411
00:23:58.125 --> 00:24:01.125
Today. I am thrilled
to announce a bipartisan bill

412
00:24:01.208 --> 00:24:05.458
that will make true progress
in the war to find a cure for cancer.

413
00:24:05.958 --> 00:24:09.166
In collaboration with the CDC and the NIH.

414
00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:11.583
we are creating a strategic partnership

415
00:24:11.666 --> 00:24:13.750
with BioPrime Pharmaceuticals.

416
00:24:13.833 --> 00:24:17.166
Thanks to the effort
of BioPrime CEO. Simon Keeley.

417
00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:19.000
and chairman. Vinod Shah.

418
00:24:19.083 --> 00:24:23.041
this bill will effectively cap
the cost of treatment.

419
00:24:23.666 --> 00:24:27.166
Finally. many of BioPrime's
breakthrough treatments

420
00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:30.333
that used to cost
in the hundreds of thousands of dollars

421
00:24:30.416 --> 00:24:34.375
will now be available
to the public at affordable prices.

422
00:24:34.875 --> 00:24:36.208
I told the American people

423
00:24:36.291 --> 00:24:39.291
that I would hold companies
like BioPrime accountable.

424
00:24:39.375 --> 00:24:41.666
and I have delivered on that promise.

425
00:24:42.208 --> 00:24:44.791
We are cleaning out the rot.

426
00:24:44.875 --> 00:24:46.916
-[reporters clamoring on TV]

428

[Ray] Again?

429
00:24:54.958 --> 00:24:57.000
I wasn't watching it. You were.

430
00:25:00.041 --> 00:25:01.750
I had a dream last night

431
00:25:01.833 --> 00:25:04.583
about that trip we took
with Mom in the woods.

432
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.041
My memory's kind of fading of her.

433
00:25:11.333 --> 00:25:15.416
I don't know. It's like I'm losing these
tiny pieces of her every day. and I just…

434
00:25:17.916 --> 00:25:20.000
I don't know.
I miss her. I miss our family.

435
00:25:21.458 --> 00:25:22.583
Me too.

436
00:25:27.416 --> 00:25:28.750
I miss her too.

437
00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:42.583
What are you planning to do?

438
00:25:43.458 --> 00:25:45.250
I just need to make sense of this.

439
00:25:46.958 --> 00:25:51.208
-I need to know.
-Just… Just leave it alone. okay?

440
00:25:52.208 --> 00:25:54.750
They already investigated.
and they didn't find anything.

441
00:25:54.833 --> 00:25:57.000
Or the guy who tried to kill you.

442
00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.333
It just was a dead-end conspiracy.

443
00:26:00.041 --> 00:26:01.250
[Ray sighs]

444
00:26:01.333 --> 00:26:03.375
-I don't believe that.
-[Rachel sighs]

445

You don't believe that.

446
00:26:08.583 --> 00:26:09.958
I need to try.

I can make it to Toronto.

If they found us at the motel.
they'll find us anywhere.

781
00:51:18.166 --> 00:51:21.333
It's gonna be okay. Rae.
I'm gonna keep you safe.

782
00:51:22.458 --> 00:51:24.083
They're coming to hurt you.

783
00:51:24.958 --> 00:51:27.958
That's why I need to stop this.
It needs to finish.

[Rachel] You plan on using that?

790

No. but I need to be ready.

791
00:52:10.291 --> 00:52:13.166
Do you know how to shoot it?
It's not a hunting rifle.

-You know I do. Rae.

793

[Ray sighs]

795
00:52:21.375 --> 00:52:24.208
It's better to have it and not need it
than need it and not have it.

796
00:52:25.083 --> 00:52:26.541
We need protection.

797
00:52:27.208 --> 00:52:30.291
Okay. so all the values
you taught me growing up

798
00:52:30.375 --> 00:52:31.958
are out the window?

I don't know who.
I don't know what he's gonna do. but…

807

Who. your dad?

808
00:53:28.708 --> 00:53:30.833
Look. I've been tryin' to stop him.
but I can't.

809
00:53:31.333 --> 00:53:34.041
The only person
he would ever listen to is my mom.

810
00:53:34.708 --> 00:53:37.916
-Can you tell me about her?
-She…

811
00:53:39.333 --> 00:53:40.625
She was a dancer.

812
00:53:41.708 --> 00:53:42.958
[sighs] She had. uh…

813
00:53:43.583 --> 00:53:46.458
tendinitis and stress fractures.

814
00:53:49.458 --> 00:53:53.125
My dad. I mean. he sparred
with guys who could take a punch.

815
00:53:54.416 --> 00:53:58.500
But you could tell that they were in pain.
You saw it. You know?

816
00:54:00.583 --> 00:54:02.625
But when my mom danced.

817
00:54:03.416 --> 00:54:04.916
she'd just smile.

818
00:54:05.916 --> 00:54:07.541
She always smiled.

819
00:54:07.625 --> 00:54:10.416
She's tough. Like you.

820
00:54:11.375 --> 00:54:12.458

Well. I'm an FBI agent.

826
00:54:26.125 --> 00:54:27.916
I do have one question.

827
00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:31.166
Who is… Paloma?

828
00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:34.541
How do you know about Paloma?

829
00:54:34.625 --> 00:54:37.666
I'm looking at a photo
that says "Rachel and Paloma."

830
00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:39.750
[bright music playing]

831
00:54:41.833 --> 00:54:44.375
I… wanted a pet. [sighs]

832
00:54:45.541 --> 00:54:48.833
But we couldn't get one
because of my mom's treatments. so…

833
00:54:51.250 --> 00:54:53.333
so she got me a stuffed bunny.

834
00:54:55.625 --> 00:54:56.708
Paloma.

835
00:55:01.541 --> 00:55:02.708

836

You…

837
00:55:04.833 --> 00:55:08.166
She was always. uh. looking out for me.

838
00:55:11.291 --> 00:55:13.125
Even when she couldn't. [sighs]

839
00:55:13.958 --> 00:55:15.500
You'd make her proud.

840
00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:17.541
And your dad.

841
00:55:17.625 --> 00:55:21.916
[breathing shakily]
I don't know what he's gonna do.

842
00:55:22.875 --> 00:55:24.416
Hey. Listen to me.

Get outta the car.

00:56:30.916 --> 00:56:32.541
What about the motel?

863
00:56:33.291 --> 00:56:35.666
That was unplanned. Pump the gas.

And she never gave it back.

[inhales sharply]
I know people at the DOJ.

1358
01:37:29.333 --> 01:37:32.041
They can make the charges
against you go away.

1359

And you can have a life.

1360

I fought against them! [panting]

1369
01:38:02.625 --> 01:38:06.416
You took their bribe.
and you gave them exclusive contracts.

1370
01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:09.333
You're responsible
for ordering the hit on Martin Bennett.

her revenge. Why come back?

1409

at Diana Morgan's campaign rally
yesterday afternoon.

1410
01:40:39.583 --> 01:40:41.250
[Meeker] What was she doing there?

1411
01:40:44.333 --> 01:40:47.458
[reporter on TV] The fugitive
from last night's assassination attempt…

1412

anyone with information

[Rothman] First Keeley.
then Shah. now a congresswoman?

1417
01:40:58.333 --> 01:41:00.000
It just seems so bizarre.

1418
01:41:00.750 --> 01:41:02.750
[Meeker] Rachel clearly knows something.

1419
01:41:04.166 --> 01:41:07.125
Let's go through Diana Morgan's
campaign donations.

Rachel Cooper just sent us something.

1423
01:41:18.875 --> 01:41:22.708
[Morgan on recording]
I took the bribe. I ordered the hit.

1424
01:41:24.041 --> 01:41:27.166
The candidate with the most money wins.

1425
01:41:28.583 --> 01:41:29.583
That's how it works.

Simon Keeley and Vinod Shah

1431
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:45.916

1436
01:41:58.958 --> 01:42:00.708
[Ray] The past is like a dream.

1437
01:42:02.208 --> 01:42:05.166
A mosaic of images and feelings

1438
01:42:05.250 --> 01:42:07.791
that offers some truth
about how we got here.

1439
01:42:07.875 --> 01:42:10.291
even if details have blurred with time.

1442
01:42:17.458 --> 01:42:18.916
[Rachel] …and they begin?
