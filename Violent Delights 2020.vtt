00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:07.794
O.k. what?

00:02:07.877 --> 00:02:08.711
Let's go

7
00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:09.754
Where?

8
00:02:10.088 --> 00:02:11.923
It's getting late for the bar.

9
00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:13.925
they are waiting

10
00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:17.679
my friends are waiting

11
00:02:17.762 --> 00:02:18.429
Let them wait

12
00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:36.906
Holy fuck!. this jerk never stop snoring
for the whole night!

13
00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:38.616
No fucking kiddin'. that's not true

14
00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:42.120
To be honest. tonight I'd rather sleep in the car

15
00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:43.454
And what if you get cold?

16
00:02:45.123 --> 00:02:46.875
Or at least if you let me sleep with you guys

17
00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:48.251
Yes. you wish

18
00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:51.963
You need to ask Thomas for permission

19
00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:53.798
Little Thom

20
00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:56.050
How do you know he's the "Little Thom"

21
00:02:58.219 --> 00:02:59.596
The "little one"

22
00:02:59.721 --> 00:03:01.055
Don´t listen to this asshole.

23
00:03:01.222 --> 00:03:04.100
gonna get her so drunk that
she wouldn't remember where she'd sleep

24
00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:07.604
Hey! what about those guys she's flirting with

25
00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:29.751
She's been doing it with all the boys in town

26
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.295
Yeah right. I'm feeling the heat

27
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.425
She already got horny

28
00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:03.386
Let's get some tacos.

29
00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:07.473
he's taking too long

30
00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:13.730
You take the ages.
try to be more considered please

31
00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:09.535
Is this your house?

32
00:06:09.952 --> 00:06:10.828
Yes. I live here

33
00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:50.785
Good evening.

34
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.578
come on in.

35
00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:54.122
have a sit.

36
00:06:54.288 --> 00:06:55.706
I'm leaving now

37
00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:58.501
¿What's your name boy?

38
00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:00.962
Hey you! What's your name?

39
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.839
Joshua.

40
00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:04.674
my name's Joshua

41
00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:07.051
I'm Gabriel

42
00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:09.178
Have a sit…

43
00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:14.475
and. what do you do for living?

44
00:07:16.352 --> 00:07:17.812
still studying I supposed.

45
00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:20.606
you look pretty young to me

46
00:07:25.486 --> 00:07:27.488
You're here to fuck her. huh?

47
00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:33.452
she's cute.

48
00:07:34.412 --> 00:07:35.746
so cute.

49
00:07:37.665 --> 00:07:38.875
Alani.

50
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.169
her name's Alani

51
00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:48.926
and she's really pretty

52
00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:56.350
Beauty through years

53
00:07:57.351 --> 00:07:58.769
becomes a regular thing.

54
00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:01.981
you get used to it

55
00:08:03.524 --> 00:08:04.942
and then you forget it.

56
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.238
forgetting

57
00:08:10.239 --> 00:08:11.657
is a dangerous thing.

58
00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:15.995
really dangerous.

59
00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:21.000
because you start to search beauty

60
00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:23.669
in other places.

61
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:32.929
Is him your husband?

62
00:08:34.972 --> 00:08:36.390
My partner…

63
00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:41.020
don't worry.

64
00:08:44.106 --> 00:08:45.524
he's harmless

65
00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:50.321
Look.

66
00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:54.492
She's beautiful. don't you think so?

67
00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.341
Although beauty is not positive.

68
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.718
it's a charge.

69
00:09:13.844 --> 00:09:15.263
a hindrance.

70
00:09:16.764 --> 00:09:18.683
attracts predators

71
00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:24.188
and we

72
00:09:25.439 --> 00:09:26.983
are predeators.

73
00:09:31.779 --> 00:09:34.198
The best thing you can get it's to die buddy.

74
00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:38.536
I can give you immortality.

75
00:09:40.579 --> 00:09:41.747
it's a shame.

76
00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:44.583
I'm not in a good mood.

77
00:11:14.131 --> 00:11:21.555
TO DRINK FOR YOUR BLOOD

78
00:12:50.728 --> 00:12:52.271
Who do you think she looks like?

79
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.358
It's a girl.

80
00:12:56.692 --> 00:12:59.153
to you I supposed.

81
00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:03.574
I hope she looks like you because if she looks like me.

82
00:13:04.033 --> 00:13:05.451
little poor girl.

83
00:13:11.999 --> 00:13:14.043
Do you feel comfortable with this of being a father?

84
00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:16.337
Yes

85
00:13:22.927 --> 00:13:26.263
Don't you think you'll be better
with the other girl you were dating?

86
00:13:32.728 --> 00:13:34.813
It's a topic that we've already been through

87
00:13:36.106 --> 00:13:38.192
and don't want to go through it again.

88
00:13:39.109 --> 00:13:40.486
We didn't used live together any longer.

89
00:13:42.321 --> 00:13:45.074
it wasn't until I told you about
the pregnancy that you got back with me.

90
00:13:46.367 --> 00:13:47.785
I know

91
00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:50.037
I went away.

92
00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:53.999
but that doesn't mean I stopped loving you

93
00:13:55.584 --> 00:13:57.002
I don't know.

94
00:13:57.878 --> 00:14:00.589
I'm not sure if you'd like to be father of this baby

95
00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:06.220
To be honest. I'm afraid.

96
00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:08.681
I'm worried

97
00:14:09.098 --> 00:14:11.267
about the expenses. food.

98
00:14:13.143 --> 00:14:15.062
to disappoint you.

99
00:14:16.063 --> 00:14:18.357
but I'm with you.

100
00:14:20.484 --> 00:14:22.152
You didn't want to be a father.

101
00:14:23.028 --> 00:14:25.698
since boyfriends you've said
you didn't want to have children

102
00:14:27.783 --> 00:14:29.201
You didn't want it either.

103
00:14:29.493 --> 00:14:30.911
and look at us now.

104
00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.584
I just wanted to have children when I first met you.

105
00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:40.588
Well. people change.

106
00:14:51.932 --> 00:14:53.726
Are you sure you don't miss her?

107
00:14:54.351 --> 00:14:56.395
I told you because I mean it

108
00:14:57.605 --> 00:15:01.358
I'm here because I want to be with you guys.
besides I don't want to talk about it.

109
00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:33.307
Help!

110
00:15:36.226 --> 00:15:37.645
Help!

111
00:15:38.145 --> 00:15:39.563
Help!

112
00:16:19.144 --> 00:16:21.313
And now. why are you so upset?

113
00:16:24.525 --> 00:16:28.195
I'm mad because you haven't had the will
to have a baby with me

114
00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:31.448
You know I don't want to be a father.

115
00:16:32.366 --> 00:16:34.910
and I was clear since the beginning.

116
00:16:37.788 --> 00:16:39.373
You were father already.

117
00:16:40.457 --> 00:16:42.042
even if they have died.

118
00:16:42.584 --> 00:16:44.002
you were once a father.

119
00:16:45.003 --> 00:16:49.466
We've gave up on having children
since pretty long time ago.

120
00:16:50.175 --> 00:16:53.220
and actually. you've asked me to become immortal.

121
00:16:53.595 --> 00:16:55.013
You're selfish fucked!

122
00:16:55.305 --> 00:16:57.850
You've said it was to be alone. just you & I

123
00:16:58.267 --> 00:17:00.894
You're a selfish fucked!

124
00:17:03.355 --> 00:17:05.983
Can't I have something for me?

125
00:17:06.275 --> 00:17:07.693
Something that I want?

126
00:17:13.073 --> 00:17:14.491
Come here bitch.

127
00:17:14.742 --> 00:17:16.118
come here

128
00:17:17.786 --> 00:17:20.372
Take your damn whore with you

129
00:17:20.914 --> 00:17:22.708
I did love you.

130
00:17:23.083 --> 00:17:24.877
I did everything for you.

131
00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:29.298
but you've corrupted our relationship.

132
00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:33.093
No!

133
00:17:35.095 --> 00:17:36.680
¡Please!

134
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.566
You and I stopped being what it was
for a long time ago

135
00:17:50.986 --> 00:17:52.988
The worst enemy of a couple

136
00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.158
are not the children.

137
00:17:57.367 --> 00:17:58.786
it's time.

138
00:17:59.369 --> 00:18:00.954
it's routine.

139
00:18:01.955 --> 00:18:03.373
life.

140
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:08.128
and love.

141
00:18:10.714 --> 00:18:13.592
In the eternity there's
a lot of time that has had corrupted us.

142
00:19:47.936 --> 00:19:50.439
Don't worry. it's ok.

143
00:19:54.109 --> 00:19:56.028
You're a beautiful woman.

144
00:19:59.448 --> 00:20:00.866
it's not that I don't want it.

145
00:20:04.077 --> 00:20:05.454
but I'm going to be a father.

146
00:20:07.539 --> 00:20:08.957
I understand.

147
00:20:09.791 --> 00:20:11.168
you love your woman.

148
00:20:13.045 --> 00:20:14.796
No. I don’t love her.

149
00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:16.882
I'm going to be a father.

150
00:20:33.315 --> 00:20:35.150
I'm also with a man I don't want.

151
00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.405
think we're both caught.

152
00:22:35.812 --> 00:22:37.981
You're going to need a bigger size.

153
00:22:39.483 --> 00:22:40.901
Yes. isn't?

154
00:22:44.112 --> 00:22:45.530
How long have you been pregnant?

155
00:22:46.573 --> 00:22:48.366
Five. five months.

156
00:22:50.744 --> 00:22:52.120
Can I touch?

157
00:22:59.419 --> 00:23:00.837
It´s a girl.

158
00:23:01.755 --> 00:23:03.173
You really want this girl.

159
00:23:04.466 --> 00:23:06.009
You really wished to get pregnant.

160
00:23:12.349 --> 00:23:14.434
you'll call her Julia.

161
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:16.770
as your mother.

162
00:23:20.023 --> 00:23:21.483
she died a year ago.

163
00:23:24.361 --> 00:23:25.821
cancer.

164
00:23:28.615 --> 00:23:30.450
you were for long time with her.

165
00:23:31.868 --> 00:23:34.371
that was just about to finish with your relationship.

166
00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:38.792
you needed to split your time

167
00:23:39.042 --> 00:23:41.670
between him and her.

168
00:23:47.217 --> 00:23:49.219
You were with her when she died.

169
00:23:52.889 --> 00:23:55.809
you’ve looked at her eyes while she took

170
00:23:56.601 --> 00:23:58.019
her last breath.

171
00:24:02.816 --> 00:24:04.651
went out to ask for help.

172
00:24:06.153 --> 00:24:07.529
but there was nobody.

173
00:24:09.072 --> 00:24:10.448
you knew it was the end.

174
00:24:12.742 --> 00:24:15.245
you've sat to cry at the door…

175
00:24:20.292 --> 00:24:21.877
Girl.

176
00:24:29.718 --> 00:24:31.303
easy.

177
00:24:39.728 --> 00:24:41.313
everything will be alright

178
00:24:50.906 --> 00:24:52.490
It's a gift that I've always got.

179
00:24:53.491 --> 00:24:55.827
although I don't always consider it something good.

180
00:24:56.328 --> 00:24:58.163
because people it's filled with pain.

181
00:24:58.914 --> 00:25:00.624
full of scars.

182
00:25:00.999 --> 00:25:02.709
emotional scars.

183
00:25:03.293 --> 00:25:04.711
that only I can see.

184
00:25:05.212 --> 00:25:07.088
that's why I don't consider it so good.

185
00:25:08.298 --> 00:25:10.175
Well it's extraordinary.

186
00:25:11.009 --> 00:25:12.427
it's really good

187
00:25:12.969 --> 00:25:15.388
to have someone that knows you.

188
00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:19.392
that understands you. to make you feel accompanied.

189
00:25:19.726 --> 00:25:21.144
not that alone.

190
00:25:21.645 --> 00:25:23.730
I wish you could see inside my person.

191
00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.400
I also wish I could penetrate

192
00:25:27.817 --> 00:25:30.362
in your mind and your inside.

193
00:25:32.614 --> 00:25:34.991
Everybody needs someone to understand us.

194
00:25:35.992 --> 00:25:37.869
that's something I really know well how to do.

195
00:25:38.578 --> 00:25:39.704
someone who listens.

196
00:25:40.163 --> 00:25:41.373
support.

197
00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:43.124
to like one.

198
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:44.584
an entity.

199
00:25:46.169 --> 00:25:47.504
an energy.

200
00:25:48.171 --> 00:25:49.589
love.

201
00:25:51.716 --> 00:25:54.803
Let me invite you to a play tonight.

202
00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:56.388

203
00:25:56.638 --> 00:25:58.056
I'm an actor.

204
00:25:58.723 --> 00:26:00.392

You'll be my special guests.

209
00:26:14.114 --> 00:26:15.907

210
00:26:16.324 --> 00:26:17.742
I offer you a big dinner.

211
00:26:18.368 --> 00:26:19.786

212
00:26:20.912 --> 00:26:23.039
and my specialty it's flesh

213
00:26:23.999 --> 00:26:25.250
and blood.

214
00:26:28.962 --> 00:26:31.506
Well. I'll have to take my couple with me

215
00:26:31.798 --> 00:26:33.133
Of course!

216
00:26:33.758 --> 00:26:36.136
I'm sure he'll find some of interest too.

217
00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:39.848
Are we on?

218
00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:42.851
let's go. it's raining!

219
00:26:43.184 --> 00:26:44.561
Let's go!

220
00:27:08.376 --> 00:27:09.753
Hi sweetie.

221
00:27:10.462 --> 00:27:11.838
Where were you?

222
00:27:12.047 --> 00:27:13.423
At the cinema

223
00:27:14.215 --> 00:27:16.092
You took too long. don't you think so?

224
00:27:16.384 --> 00:27:20.305
Yes. it took me more than I thought.

225
00:27:22.182 --> 00:27:24.684
Well I had a great time the whole evening.

226
00:27:25.018 --> 00:27:26.770
we've met and actor who's also a medium.

227
00:27:28.063 --> 00:27:30.565
Medium? That sounds like deceiver.

228
00:27:31.983 --> 00:27:34.361
No… He invited us to a play

229
00:27:34.819 --> 00:27:36.112
and then dinner at his house.

230
00:27:36.821 --> 00:27:38.865
the girls and I are so excited.

231
00:27:39.366 --> 00:27:40.909
And… at what time are you leaving?

232
00:27:42.035 --> 00:27:44.079
they haven't say a thing

233
00:27:44.496 --> 00:27:45.872
no me han dicho nada

234
00:27:46.164 --> 00:27:47.582
and I need to get changed…

235
00:27:49.626 --> 00:27:51.044
come on. let's go.

236
00:27:51.336 --> 00:27:53.254
you were not with me for the whole evening.

237
00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.258
come with us.

238
00:28:00.261 --> 00:28:01.679
The truth.

239
00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:03.348
it's I don't even think you should go.

240
00:28:03.556 --> 00:28:06.101
It sounds like he's a deceiver and sure
it's going to charge you a lot of money.

241
00:28:07.018 --> 00:28:08.770
Well if he does...

242
00:28:09.813 --> 00:28:11.481
I would...

243
00:28:11.731 --> 00:28:13.149
pay.

244
00:28:17.028 --> 00:28:19.447
You smell funny.

245
00:28:19.614 --> 00:28:20.990
No…

246
00:28:23.993 --> 00:28:27.539
look. what if I take a quick bath. change

247
00:28:27.872 --> 00:28:29.290
and we're leaving…

248
00:28:34.587 --> 00:28:36.131
Don't take too long

249
00:28:36.214 --> 00:28:37.424
No.

250
00:29:59.547 --> 00:30:03.301
Desire

251
00:30:05.136 --> 00:30:08.014

drink of your blood I want.

263
00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:04.255
Thank you very much to be with us.

264
00:32:04.714 --> 00:32:06.299

265
00:32:33.117 --> 00:32:34.869

Thanks.

269
00:32:57.517 --> 00:32:58.935

270
00:32:59.477 --> 00:33:00.895
Cheers.

271
00:33:01.854 --> 00:33:03.272
Cheers.

272
00:33:10.071 --> 00:33:12.615
I'm really glad you've accepted my invitation to dinner.

273
00:33:13.741 --> 00:33:16.160
I hope the play has been of your taste.

274
00:33:17.829 --> 00:33:19.539
Let me introduce you to my couple…

275
00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:21.374
Alani.

276
00:33:24.544 --> 00:33:26.546
Hi there!. I'm Alani.

277
00:33:28.631 --> 00:33:30.049
Hi.

278
00:33:30.299 --> 00:33:31.718
I'm Javier.

279
00:33:35.221 --> 00:33:37.390
she's my couple. Lizeth.

280
00:33:38.224 --> 00:33:39.434
Hi.

281
00:33:39.726 --> 00:33:40.935
Lizeth.

282
00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:42.270
nice to meet you.

283
00:33:48.443 --> 00:33:49.902
Hope you like it!

284
00:33:50.903 --> 00:33:53.156
it's a special dish I learnt at Peru.

285
00:33:55.324 --> 00:33:56.701
And you are?

286
00:33:57.285 --> 00:33:58.661
it's a pleasure. Claudia.

287
00:33:58.828 --> 00:34:00.204
My pleasure. and you are?

288
00:34:00.538 --> 00:34:01.831
Hi! I'm Vania.

289
00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:04.125
Both of you are really pretty.

290
00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:06.878
we should go out sometime.

291
00:34:07.044 --> 00:34:08.421
Sure! Yes!

292
00:34:10.339 --> 00:34:13.342
Well. let's celebrate because of our new friends.

293
00:34:13.843 --> 00:34:16.179
and for what we hope it's going to be

294
00:34:17.013 --> 00:34:18.556
an unforgettable evening.

295
00:34:30.526 --> 00:34:32.612
I think I imagine how you met Gabriel.

296
00:34:33.946 --> 00:34:35.490
Who of you did he read?

297
00:34:35.823 --> 00:34:37.366
Me! He read me.

298
00:34:37.575 --> 00:34:39.452
your husband is wonderful.

299
00:34:39.702 --> 00:34:41.788
he told me things no one did before.

300
00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:44.040
My couple.

301
00:34:44.332 --> 00:34:45.583
we are not married.

302
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:47.543
How long have you been together?

303
00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:49.712
It seems like eternity.

304
00:34:51.297 --> 00:34:52.590
Really? how old are you?

305
00:34:54.175 --> 00:34:55.468
How old do I look like?

306
00:34:56.177 --> 00:34:58.179
I don't know.

307
00:34:58.721 --> 00:35:02.683
you look young but there's something old in you…

308
00:35:03.017 --> 00:35:04.811
Like an old soul.

309
00:35:05.103 --> 00:35:06.521
yes. like an old soul.

310
00:35:06.854 --> 00:35:10.233
Alani has a gift. same as me.

311
00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:12.276
but it's a lot more sensitive.

312
00:35:13.319 --> 00:35:14.695
it's like in nature.

313
00:35:15.363 --> 00:35:17.698
female are predators.

314
00:35:25.456 --> 00:35:27.125
You look great as couple.

315
00:35:27.333 --> 00:35:29.001
How long have you been together?

316
00:35:31.546 --> 00:35:33.464
Well. it's been so many years.

317
00:35:35.007 --> 00:35:37.301
we were together during high school.

318
00:35:37.552 --> 00:35:39.554
after that each one took their own road.

319
00:35:39.846 --> 00:35:41.848
we met again.

320
00:35:42.181 --> 00:35:43.432
we've fall apart.

321
00:35:43.724 --> 00:35:45.810
and now together again.

322
00:35:47.812 --> 00:35:49.647
And your waiting for a girl.

323
00:35:50.565 --> 00:35:51.816
How did you know it?

324
00:35:53.192 --> 00:35:56.320
Told you that my woman has many gifts.

325
00:35:57.113 --> 00:35:58.614
better than mine.

326
00:36:03.536 --> 00:36:05.037
How does it feel? to be pregnant?

327
00:36:07.957 --> 00:36:09.375
Well.

328
00:36:10.751 --> 00:36:12.503
it's really uncomfortable.

329
00:36:12.962 --> 00:36:14.714
first your body starts to change.

330
00:36:15.923 --> 00:36:17.675
your skin stretches…

331
00:36:18.634 --> 00:36:20.845
you never thoughts in kids?

332
00:36:22.263 --> 00:36:23.556
No.

333
00:36:23.973 --> 00:36:27.018
our time to become parents has gone.
since pretty long time…

334
00:36:28.019 --> 00:36:29.645
How that young?

335
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:34.275
it's because a biologic problem.

336
00:36:35.443 --> 00:36:37.028
What a shame.

337
00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:45.786
Can I?

338
00:36:52.501 --> 00:36:56.047
I can feel him heart beating.

339
00:36:56.839 --> 00:36:59.634
and blood running through his little body.

340
00:37:04.096 --> 00:37:06.182
He knows you're his mother.

341
00:37:18.694 --> 00:37:20.571
But not about his father.

342
00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:25.826
he'll know it when he'd met him.

343
00:37:32.583 --> 00:37:33.960
Excuse me.

344
00:37:35.419 --> 00:37:36.796
I need to retire.

345
00:37:45.596 --> 00:37:48.182
My woman is too sensitive as I told you.

346
00:37:52.353 --> 00:37:55.189
Would you like a dessert?

347
00:37:57.775 --> 00:37:59.318
Yes!

348
00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:01.737
You're going to love it. it's delicious.

349
00:38:04.031 --> 00:38:06.158
I'm shure your are going to love it.

350
00:38:07.576 --> 00:38:08.995
Let's go.

351
00:38:09.412 --> 00:38:10.579
Both of us?

352
00:38:11.247 --> 00:38:14.333
Come on. it is something big.

353
00:38:14.875 --> 00:38:17.420
we'll need more than four hands.

354
00:38:18.045 --> 00:38:19.463
Let's go!

355
00:38:19.672 --> 00:38:21.090
Let's go.

356
00:38:35.938 --> 00:38:38.274
This is enormous!

357
00:38:38.774 --> 00:38:40.234
Smells delicious.

358
00:38:40.526 --> 00:38:41.902
Would you like some?

359
00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:43.446
Go on.

360
00:40:22.253 --> 00:40:25.172
Baby. he's your father.

361
00:40:26.549 --> 00:40:28.717
he's dying to meet you.

362
00:40:31.011 --> 00:40:32.429
Don't you think he'd like to meet you?

363
00:40:34.014 --> 00:40:36.642
I don't think she doesn't even know she has a dad.

364
00:40:36.934 --> 00:40:38.602
Don't be ridiculous.

365
00:40:39.478 --> 00:40:40.688
obviously she knows.

366
00:40:43.315 --> 00:40:46.861
Well then maybe I'm the one
who doesn't want her to know.

367
00:40:49.155 --> 00:40:50.573
You're hypocrite.

368
00:40:50.906 --> 00:40:52.324
Selfish.

369
00:40:58.122 --> 00:41:00.833
I just know that this situation is beyond my reach.

370
00:41:02.835 --> 00:41:04.253
Forgive me.

371
00:41:05.004 --> 00:41:08.299
I know you don't mean it but

372
00:41:11.719 --> 00:41:14.513
I just wanted to be honest.

373
00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:20.311
If you wanted to be honest you
wouldn't get back to me since the beginning.

374
00:41:22.021 --> 00:41:24.899
You hurt yourself. and you hurt the others.

375
00:41:27.151 --> 00:41:28.569
Really.

376
00:41:29.695 --> 00:41:32.489
if you're just with me because of the baby
I set you free!

377
00:41:32.907 --> 00:41:34.325
Go on.

378
00:41:35.492 --> 00:41:37.494
I'm not going to prohibit you seeing her.

379
00:41:37.661 --> 00:41:39.079
You are her father.

380
00:41:40.164 --> 00:41:42.208
But I don't want next to me someone who doesn't love me.

381
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:44.835
Why don't you stop hurting me?

382
00:43:55.341 --> 00:44:00.054
What is it dear? Why are you crying?
You're going to hurt your baby.

383
00:44:01.221 --> 00:44:03.682
Could open the door please. I need to leave.

384
00:44:04.475 --> 00:44:06.935
I don't understand. your boyfriend is upstairs.

385
00:44:07.353 --> 00:44:08.771
Are you mad at each other?

386
00:44:12.816 --> 00:44:14.860
That is out of your business.

387
00:44:15.652 --> 00:44:17.696
Why don't you try to fix the things up.

388
00:44:24.787 --> 00:44:26.538
I didn't have a happy family.

389
00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:29.416
You did. Didn't you?

390
00:44:34.755 --> 00:44:37.216
Do you think the child would look like Javier?

391
00:44:41.136 --> 00:44:42.971
What do you know about Javier?

392
00:44:43.639 --> 00:44:45.474
What can you say about him?

393
00:44:47.518 --> 00:44:49.978
Do you think you're the only one in Javier's life?

394
00:44:53.607 --> 00:44:56.068
Javier loves me.

395
00:44:58.987 --> 00:45:00.823
We're going to have a baby.

396
00:45:01.698 --> 00:45:03.534
whether you like it or not.

397
00:45:05.702 --> 00:45:07.079
Can't you get it?

398
00:45:07.913 --> 00:45:10.999
You don't have any right
to get your nose in our lives.

399
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.087
Look at you.
look the house where you live.

400
00:45:26.807 --> 00:45:28.559
Claudia.

401
00:45:30.394 --> 00:45:32.438
friend wake up.

402
00:45:36.859 --> 00:45:38.902
You became a mother since really young

403
00:45:40.237 --> 00:45:42.281
Really you feel resignated?

404
00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:45.868
To spend your whole life with a person

405
00:45:46.577 --> 00:45:48.412
who you're in doubt every moment?

406
00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:51.999
you're suspicious been true lady.

407
00:45:53.083 --> 00:45:54.835
he cheats on you.

408
00:45:55.252 --> 00:45:57.004
he lives a double life.

409
00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:59.631
has another wife

410
00:45:59.965 --> 00:46:01.008
and son.

411
00:46:13.729 --> 00:46:16.857
¿How can you be net to such a disgusting man?

412
00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:20.944
Can't you realize?

413
00:46:29.369 --> 00:46:31.747
You have the same look as my father.

414
00:46:34.166 --> 00:46:37.586
when I cut his throat with a blade.

415
00:46:44.176 --> 00:46:48.764
my mother laughed
while drawn in her own blood.

416
00:46:50.224 --> 00:46:52.851
Do you listen to what you're saying?

417
00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:54.478
You are...

418
00:46:55.103 --> 00:46:57.940
insane!

419
00:47:02.194 --> 00:47:03.987
Love is not a universal thing.

420
00:47:04.279 --> 00:47:05.864
you got to understand it.

421
00:47:07.241 --> 00:47:11.078
We need to be prepare because
they're going to betrayed us.

422
00:47:15.541 --> 00:47:17.918
the only thing we have

423
00:47:19.127 --> 00:47:21.171
is the addictive sensation of love.

424
00:47:28.762 --> 00:47:30.389
That's to you.

425
00:47:33.141 --> 00:47:35.561
you don't even know how to love yourself.

426
00:47:37.271 --> 00:47:41.024
how do you want someone else to love you.
if you can't do it by your own.

427
00:47:45.654 --> 00:47:47.573
I do feel loved.

428
00:47:52.536 --> 00:47:54.288
by the same man who loves you.

429
00:47:54.413 --> 00:47:55.789
Shut up!

430
00:47:55.998 --> 00:47:57.833
I've already told you that Javier is mine!

431
00:48:01.253 --> 00:48:02.671
Let me go.

432
00:48:03.005 --> 00:48:04.423
Let me go.

433
00:48:06.133 --> 00:48:07.551
Let me go.

434
00:48:21.148 --> 00:48:23.233
I've never got pregnant.

435
00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:28.739
that's why I envy you.

436
00:48:47.132 --> 00:48:48.884
Don't you ever mention God!

437
00:48:49.718 --> 00:48:51.470
the coward who disappoint you.

438
00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:54.139
how can you keep trusting in someone

439
00:48:54.514 --> 00:48:57.476
Who is just a silent witness
of your pain. your suffering?

440
00:48:58.977 --> 00:49:00.437
What is happening to me?

441
00:49:02.814 --> 00:49:04.274
You should be thankful.

442
00:49:05.067 --> 00:49:07.653
I'll make of you a best woman.

443
00:49:09.946 --> 00:49:12.407
My poison runs through all your body.

444
00:49:13.659 --> 00:49:15.494
soon you'll be one of us.

445
00:49:15.911 --> 00:49:17.746
an immortal.

446
00:49:19.247 --> 00:49:21.500
you'll drink the blood of the living.

447
00:49:23.377 --> 00:49:26.004
you'll be better. because God

448
00:49:27.255 --> 00:49:28.715
God made you weak.

449
00:49:32.219 --> 00:49:34.888
God's not guilty of what I'm?

450
00:50:49.004 --> 00:50:50.338
Vania!

451
00:50:50.505 --> 00:50:51.840
Vania!

452
00:51:03.393 --> 00:51:05.270
What you're going to give me for saving your life?

453
00:51:05.395 --> 00:51:06.813
What have you done to Vania?

454
00:51:09.191 --> 00:51:11.109
Nothing that she didn't want.

455
00:52:44.661 --> 00:52:45.871
Are you going to kill me?

456
00:52:47.622 --> 00:52:48.832
What do you offer me?

457
00:52:54.546 --> 00:52:55.755
The decision is yours.

458
00:52:57.924 --> 00:52:59.134
Nothing.

459
00:52:59.801 --> 00:53:01.011
What are you going to do to me?

460
00:53:03.555 --> 00:53:04.764
Then...

461
00:53:06.808 --> 00:53:09.978
it will be fun to watch how love
can last between two friends?

462
00:53:11.521 --> 00:53:12.564
!No!

463
00:53:12.689 --> 00:53:14.357
!No!

464
00:53:29.039 --> 00:53:30.081
What are you anyway?

465
00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:35.086
Don't you worry.

466
00:53:35.921 --> 00:53:37.297
I'm not letting any anyone hurt you.

467
00:53:39.633 --> 00:53:41.801
is it true that I really feel you near me.

468
00:53:44.721 --> 00:53:47.724
I feel you near too

469
00:54:23.218 --> 00:54:26.054
It's been so long without feeling
so comfortable with somebody.

470
00:54:36.731 --> 00:54:38.400
Love is a sick thing

471
00:54:39.859 --> 00:54:42.529
that changes thru the years

472
00:54:44.656 --> 00:54:48.618
and changes because we people change.

473
00:54:57.585 --> 00:55:02.007
Amorousness is essence of love.

474
00:55:03.967 --> 00:55:05.552
Is what make us see the other.

475
00:55:07.178 --> 00:55:08.763
Yo creo que el enamoramiento.

476
00:55:10.015 --> 00:55:11.599
I think amorousness is the best stage

477
00:55:12.225 --> 00:55:13.810
of the couple.

478
00:55:17.856 --> 00:55:19.274
The best kisses.

479
00:55:30.827 --> 00:55:32.787
the best pettings

480
00:55:44.424 --> 00:55:46.384
and the best sex.

481
00:55:57.395 --> 00:55:59.355
we feel so alive

482
00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:03.526
that's why most of us would like
to live in eternal amorousness

483
00:56:07.489 --> 00:56:09.991
That's why we always want to fall in love.

484
00:56:10.533 --> 00:56:12.327
because it's addictive.

485
00:56:17.290 --> 00:56:20.001
Is the stage in which we can get pregnant.

486
00:56:24.172 --> 00:56:29.636
the vital force is so strong that we take it away from the
other during sex.

487
00:56:31.971 --> 00:56:34.516
One dies so the other lives.

488
00:56:36.267 --> 00:56:39.604
is the highest sacrifice
that a father can make

489
00:56:40.271 --> 00:56:42.065
for mother and son to live in eternity.

490
00:56:58.331 --> 00:57:00.125
Gabriel is a big selfish

491
00:57:05.088 --> 00:57:06.881
What you want is him to get you pregnant

492
00:57:08.299 --> 00:57:10.552
and die voluntarily.

493
00:57:11.970 --> 00:57:14.222
Well my life will be your son's. right?

494
00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:24.232
Our lovechild.

495
00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:51.843
Claudia.

496
00:57:52.177 --> 00:57:53.720
Claudia.

497
00:58:13.239 --> 00:58:14.782
Don't you love me?

498
00:58:16.201 --> 00:58:17.118
I don't know.

499
00:58:19.078 --> 00:58:20.955
besides. in a few I'm going to be a father.

500
00:58:22.123 --> 00:58:24.334
yes but don't you love the mother.

501
00:58:26.044 --> 00:58:27.921
I can see in your heart that is true.

502
00:58:30.757 --> 00:58:32.634
What do you fell when you're with me?

503
00:58:33.301 --> 00:58:34.719
Peace.

504
00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:36.638
lots of peace.

505
00:58:39.515 --> 00:58:40.934
And love?

506
00:58:42.101 --> 00:58:43.519
I don't know.

507
00:58:46.481 --> 00:58:47.899
And desire?

508
00:59:03.915 --> 00:59:06.042
I want to eat you.

509
00:59:06.459 --> 00:59:08.586
That's the attitude.

510
00:59:28.273 --> 00:59:30.400
I'm so wet that I'm a complete sea.

511
00:59:30.942 --> 00:59:32.610
Drown me in your sea.

512
00:59:43.997 --> 00:59:45.665
Tell me you love me.

513
00:59:45.957 --> 00:59:47.625
I love you. I love you.

514
01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:11.357
Sweet love.

515
01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:13.192
fill me with your sperm.

516
01:00:14.902 --> 01:00:16.112
make me yours.

517
01:00:19.198 --> 01:00:20.408
Drink of my blood.

518
01:00:22.869 --> 01:00:24.078
take my being.

519
01:01:06.162 --> 01:01:07.372
I can't!

520
01:01:09.248 --> 01:01:10.875
Leave me alone!

521
01:01:12.668 --> 01:01:14.295
¿What's wrong?

522
01:01:14.629 --> 01:01:16.255
¿What happened?

523
01:01:17.965 --> 01:01:21.886
I hate you!
I hate cause you let me love you!

524
01:01:23.137 --> 01:01:26.682
I hate you cause let give
yourself completely.

525
01:01:28.142 --> 01:01:30.436
I can't kill you.

526
01:01:48.329 --> 01:01:50.915
If I'm going to have a baby with you.

527
01:01:52.041 --> 01:01:54.168
I want to share it with you.

528
01:03:24.258 --> 01:03:26.093
Like spiders.

529
01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:30.056
I can play with my prey.

530
01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:34.936
before I eat it.

531
01:03:48.199 --> 01:03:50.201
Run in your blood

532
01:03:50.743 --> 01:03:52.828
the will of living.

533
01:03:59.335 --> 01:04:03.172
that's why you're so attractive.

534
01:04:13.391 --> 01:04:17.186
Vania. friend. we knew each other since too long.

535
01:04:17.853 --> 01:04:21.524
you're the only one who stood with me
when that fucker hit and almost kill me.

536
01:04:21.983 --> 01:04:24.443
and don't you even think because of that
I ain't going to defend myself

537
01:04:25.486 --> 01:04:26.737
There's nothing better

538
01:04:27.989 --> 01:04:30.449
than a strong presence.

539
01:04:30.616 --> 01:04:32.535
your soul encourages mine.

540
01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:37.331
You want to be like us. don't you?

541
01:04:38.457 --> 01:04:41.586
The desire of immortality intoxicates you.

542
01:04:44.213 --> 01:04:46.924
We don't need anyone else.

543
01:04:48.759 --> 01:04:50.428
my friend.

544
01:05:30.885 --> 01:05:32.553
Where's Lizeth?

545
01:05:35.473 --> 01:05:37.141
She is sleeping.

546
01:05:39.435 --> 01:05:40.853
Wake her up.

547
01:06:04.126 --> 01:06:05.544
Vania!

548
01:06:09.674 --> 01:06:12.468
I was always there for you.

549
01:07:59.825 --> 01:08:01.994
My pleasure to see you here.

550
01:08:03.537 --> 01:08:04.997
How do you feel?

551
01:08:05.289 --> 01:08:06.749
Are you ok?

552
01:08:09.794 --> 01:08:11.253
Can you feel her?

553
01:08:12.505 --> 01:08:14.256
Can you feel our baby?

554
01:08:19.678 --> 01:08:21.013
she's not supposed to be here.

555
01:08:21.889 --> 01:08:23.224
let's take her out.

556
01:08:36.862 --> 01:08:38.197
Javier no.

557
01:08:43.619 --> 01:08:45.329
you've always knew.

558
01:08:46.205 --> 01:08:48.040
you and Javier. that ain't work out.

559
01:08:50.125 --> 01:08:53.504
that baby is just a desperate try
to keep the relation on

560
01:08:59.134 --> 01:09:00.553
Truly. I don't think

561
01:09:01.262 --> 01:09:03.055
this will work

562
01:09:03.556 --> 01:09:08.269
Don't please Javier.
don't tell me this I love you.

563
01:09:09.061 --> 01:09:11.230
I think you should be separated.

564
01:09:11.647 --> 01:09:13.274
Stay with me.

565
01:09:13.566 --> 01:09:15.734
I can't. forgive me.

566
01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:19.989
Javier. tell her you don't love her.

567
01:09:21.031 --> 01:09:22.491
Go away bitch!

568
01:09:22.867 --> 01:09:24.785
Why don't you leave us alone.

569
01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:27.705
Forgive me.

570
01:09:27.955 --> 01:09:31.500
Tell her. you hurt her more when you don't say the truth.

571
01:09:32.251 --> 01:09:34.712
What is what you want?

572
01:09:37.047 --> 01:09:39.091
You think I'm going to take this?

573
01:09:41.051 --> 01:09:43.095
after so many years like this with Gabriel.

574
01:09:46.765 --> 01:09:48.809
To accept that she loves others?

575
01:09:50.561 --> 01:09:52.605
Or what is your fantasy?

576
01:09:53.022 --> 01:09:55.065
Have both of us?

577
01:09:56.025 --> 01:09:57.776
To love both of us?

578
01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:02.489
Fuck the two of us?

579
01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:08.287
Yes. I know how to pleasure a woman.

580
01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:11.874
¡Let me go! ¡Go away!

581
01:10:13.417 --> 01:10:16.086
I know how to use my tongue.

582
01:10:18.839 --> 01:10:21.258
Let me go. Leave me alone!

583
01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:24.970
Let's go Javier!

584
01:10:33.562 --> 01:10:35.731
Come on Javier please.

585
01:10:37.441 --> 01:10:38.859
Let me go.

586
01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:43.322
I can't.

587
01:10:44.114 --> 01:10:46.116
Forgive me but I can't.

588
01:10:47.576 --> 01:10:49.578
I don't want to be with you.

589
01:10:53.123 --> 01:10:54.208
Forgive me.

590
01:10:56.335 --> 01:10:57.419
Forgive me.

591
01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:00.547
I don't want to.

592
01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:03.592
I don't want to be with you.

593
01:11:10.891 --> 01:11:14.019
I always feel envy with pregnant woman.

594
01:11:18.816 --> 01:11:22.152
It's a gift that god took away from many of us

595
01:11:35.833 --> 01:11:41.338
You. men. you had become just that of us.

596
01:11:42.297 --> 01:11:44.633
sexual objects.

597
01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:46.719
whores.

598
01:11:47.386 --> 01:11:50.139
wet pussies.

599
01:11:50.723 --> 01:11:53.475
in tits.

600
01:11:54.476 --> 01:11:56.812
with no value of creation.

601
01:11:57.688 --> 01:12:01.025
That is what God has taken from me.

602
01:12:09.074 --> 01:12:12.411
Eso es lo que dios a mi me ha quitado.

603
01:12:13.954 --> 01:12:15.998
No!

604
01:12:18.208 --> 01:12:19.752
What have you done?

605
01:12:25.174 --> 01:12:26.717
What have you done?

606
01:12:27.885 --> 01:12:31.722
Besides. I wouldn't stand
that you had another woman.

607
01:12:53.952 --> 01:12:56.413
How does it feel to give birth?

608
01:12:56.705 --> 01:12:58.457
How does it feel to be a father?

609
01:13:00.542 --> 01:13:02.628
How does it feel to have everything?

610
01:13:05.923 --> 01:13:07.841
To have a child?

611
01:13:26.443 --> 01:13:28.529
Now you have what you always wanted.

612
01:13:31.657 --> 01:13:33.659
A happy family.

613
01:13:38.455 --> 01:13:40.791
As I see. dinner is ready.

614
01:13:58.642 --> 01:14:00.185
Now you're mine.

615
01:14:01.478 --> 01:14:03.564
mine like a thing.

616
01:14:06.942 --> 01:14:09.820
It feels. every beat of your heart.

617
01:14:10.779 --> 01:14:12.489
count your beats

618
01:14:12.781 --> 01:14:14.950
and keep them in your memory

619
01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:18.787
and have the taste of blood in your mouth.

620
01:14:19.454 --> 01:14:21.123
and keep it well in your mind.

621
01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:23.709
because it will be the only thing to remain

622
01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:26.128
after the big feast I give myself.

623
01:14:31.175 --> 01:14:32.843
Love really.

624
01:14:33.343 --> 01:14:35.012
make us weak.

625
01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:37.139
stupid.

626
01:14:38.765 --> 01:14:40.434
and is the biggest witness

627
01:14:41.393 --> 01:14:43.729
of the pain from human kind.

628
01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:19.306
Look. how love lasts

629
01:15:21.141 --> 01:15:23.977
you see soon I got someone
to be on your place.

630
01:15:29.942 --> 01:15:32.444
Forget the hope of getting out of here alive.

631
01:15:42.079 --> 01:15:44.331
You think your actions cause me pain?

632
01:15:44.998 --> 01:15:47.960
The real pain is in my inside.

633
01:16:08.563 --> 01:16:11.525
You he left in this body

634
01:16:12.776 --> 01:16:14.152
a map of pain with no mercy.

635
01:16:19.658 --> 01:16:21.285
of grieves and textures.

636
01:16:24.538 --> 01:16:26.873
same as I've done in your skin.

637
01:16:28.208 --> 01:16:31.169
my body is a continent
in which you've built roads

638
01:16:33.630 --> 01:16:36.967
and time has got me a weaker man.

639
01:16:39.303 --> 01:16:42.264
the biggest pain in this life is to change.

640
01:16:42.681 --> 01:16:44.516
to grow old.

641
01:16:44.975 --> 01:16:46.810
see how your life becomes

642
01:16:47.561 --> 01:16:49.771
blood and pus filled sores.

643
01:16:50.397 --> 01:16:52.607
you aren't young again.

644
01:16:53.275 --> 01:16:55.152
and little by little you'll see how you wouldn't

645
01:16:55.569 --> 01:16:58.238
even recognize yourself on the mirror.

646
01:16:58.864 --> 01:17:01.533
that's my real pain.

647
01:17:57.589 --> 01:17:59.591
Yes. I'm a monster.

648
01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:02.052
done at your shape and measure.

649
01:18:02.469 --> 01:18:05.639
I had become this gross mass

650
01:18:06.306 --> 01:18:08.558
and is for that you don't love me.

651
01:18:08.934 --> 01:18:10.310
for getting older?

652
01:18:10.644 --> 01:18:12.729
For not being forever young?

653
01:18:14.064 --> 01:18:16.942
Well now see what I really am.

654
01:19:09.286 --> 01:19:10.662
Go on eat.

655
01:19:12.289 --> 01:19:13.957
took her sex.

656
01:19:14.291 --> 01:19:15.375
her breasts.

657
01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:17.085
vagina.

658
01:19:17.544 --> 01:19:19.963
you feed from her soul and blood.

659
01:19:20.839 --> 01:19:22.966
you've kill her.

660
01:19:35.479 --> 01:19:37.772
that's the insect in which you've fell in love with?

661
01:19:40.192 --> 01:19:42.319
Well if you don't want to bewith me

662
01:19:42.694 --> 01:19:44.279
there's no more to do.

663
01:19:46.781 --> 01:19:48.033
vaginas.

664
01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:50.744
vaginas are there in everywhere.

665
01:19:54.414 --> 01:19:57.250
Alani isn't what I need.

666
01:19:57.834 --> 01:20:00.212
Your sex is the same as every woman.

667
01:20:51.263 --> 01:20:53.557
I wish I could have been stronger

668
01:20:53.974 --> 01:20:55.976
before time and life.

669
01:20:57.435 --> 01:20:59.813
be more integral for you

670
01:21:01.606 --> 01:21:04.776
and have given everything you've asked for

671
01:21:09.781 --> 01:21:11.700
is so hard to give love

672
01:21:13.535 --> 01:21:16.746
and so easy to think about it

673
01:21:17.831 --> 01:21:19.374
and ask for it.

674
01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:08.923
Look at me.

675
01:22:12.427 --> 01:22:15.013
see me as the first time.

676
01:22:21.269 --> 01:22:26.316
keep in your mind the moment
in which you've fell in love with me.

677
01:22:32.822 --> 01:22:34.240
kiss me.

678
01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:45.669
Take me.

679
01:22:48.296 --> 01:22:50.131
let's get pregnant.

680
01:22:54.594 --> 01:22:57.055
make my essence prevails.

681
01:23:00.392 --> 01:23:03.478
allow me to exist in another being.

682
01:23:04.896 --> 01:23:09.109
I'm already death.

683
01:23:17.283 --> 01:23:18.785
forgive me God

684
01:23:24.207 --> 01:23:26.835
for being so contradictious.

685
01:23:28.336 --> 01:23:30.046
forgive me life

686
01:23:30.422 --> 01:23:32.132
for being human.

687
01:23:33.925 --> 01:23:36.886
because I was just an irrational being.

688
01:24:22.891 --> 01:24:24.726
Forgive me.

689
01:24:28.188 --> 01:24:32.442
because I've only been selfish as a human.

690
01:24:41.201 --> 01:24:45.246
is the only thing I had to survive.
