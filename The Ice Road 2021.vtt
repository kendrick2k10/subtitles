3
00:02:24.937 --> 00:02:26.438
Yeah. Yeah.

4
00:02:29.817 --> 00:02:31.694
Right up there.
Right up in here.

5
00:02:31.777 --> 00:02:32.820
There we go.

6
00:02:40.327 --> 00:02:42.162
Aim for the rock!

7
00:03:08.564 --> 00:03:10.858
-Mankins!
- Yeah?

8
00:03:10.941 --> 00:03:13.819
You want to tell me why
your methane sensors are off?

9
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.491
I don’t know.

10
00:03:19.575 --> 00:03:21.076
Maybe the batteries are dead.

11
00:03:22.244 --> 00:03:23.454
Why don’t you get us a canary.

12
00:03:23.537 --> 00:03:25.497
This is no joke.

13
00:03:25.581 --> 00:03:28.208
These are to alert you
to concentrations of methane.

14
00:03:28.292 --> 00:03:30.294
They must stay on.

15
00:04:00.282 --> 00:04:01.867
Where’d that come from?

16
00:04:03.327 --> 00:04:05.329
Sounds like the open pit.

17
00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:07.247
We hit a methane pocket.

18
00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:09.041
That’s impossible.

19
00:04:09.124 --> 00:04:11.877
Everybody. out! Everybody. out!

20
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.591
Come on!
- Go!

21
00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:20.928
Go. go.

22
00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:22.346
No!

23
00:04:35.067 --> 00:04:37.277
-

24
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.115
Help me!

25
00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:50.082
Go. go. go!
-

26
00:05:01.385 --> 00:05:05.180
Drive. drive

27
00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:14.606
With any man

28
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.317
At five

29
00:05:17.401 --> 00:05:22.823
Drive. drive. drive. drive

30
00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:29.455
What you got. Gurty?

31
00:05:29.538 --> 00:05:32.958
Come on. you can say it.
You can say it.

32
00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:36.170
We will sort right here.

33
00:05:36.253 --> 00:05:38.630
and they will save their hands
right there.

34
00:05:38.714 --> 00:05:41.133
The coffee saved with water
for me.

35
00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:42.843
For him. For them.

36
00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:44.636
Is it coffee. Gurty?

37
00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:54.480
This how you guys
still get your kicks. huh?

38
00:05:55.814 --> 00:05:58.067
Walk away. Gurty.
They’re idiots.

39
00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.359
Hey...

40
00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:04.239
how’s it feel to be best friends
with a retard?

41
00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:09.453
He’s my brother.
Johansson.

42
00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:11.538
And I told you
never to call him that.

43
00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:13.707
Retard.

44
00:06:23.467 --> 00:06:25.344
McCann. get in here!

45
00:06:28.597 --> 00:06:30.474
I know what you get.
but I talk with a lot

46
00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:33.519
of hands for hands
sometimes.

47
00:06:33.602 --> 00:06:34.686
Gurty.

48
00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:38.357
We’re fired.

49
00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:43.362
But tires to a point
rotated go.

50
00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:45.864
Let someone else rotate them.
We’re fired.

51
00:06:45.948 --> 00:06:49.243
Pack your shit up.
Skeeter too. Come on.

52
00:06:57.334 --> 00:06:58.877
I don’t want.

53
00:06:58.961 --> 00:07:01.380
Me never been in.
and then today we don’t.

54
00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:04.383
Gurty. I don’t care.
You’re going in.

55
00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:06.927
They’re going
to look after you.

56
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.012
We’ve been together
a long time.

57
00:07:09.096 --> 00:07:13.183
but he can’t hold a job.
and I can’t carry him anymore.

58
00:07:13.267 --> 00:07:16.061
I don’t have a lot of tire left
on my own treads.

59
00:07:16.145 --> 00:07:17.604
-Will this help

60
00:07:17.688 --> 00:07:19.481
make him self-sufficient.
doctor?

61
00:07:19.565 --> 00:07:21.108
I can’t promise anything

62
00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:23.318
with language cognition scores
like these.

63
00:07:23.402 --> 00:07:25.696
but we’ll see
what we can do.

64
00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:29.324
Hi. John. I’m Dr. Talbot.
Pleased to meet you.

65
00:07:29.408 --> 00:07:32.202
Thank you. I appreciate it and
hope the world lasts for you.

66
00:07:32.286 --> 00:07:33.787
He’s saying hello.

67
00:07:33.871 --> 00:07:35.998
How long to go with them?

68
00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:37.708
With them for the time over.

69
00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:39.293
For them. For me.

70
00:07:39.376 --> 00:07:41.879
He’s asking what all this
entails. doctor.

71
00:07:41.962 --> 00:07:43.380
Well. just a few tests.

72
00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:45.591
If he qualifies
for rehabilitation.

73
00:07:45.674 --> 00:07:47.259
we arrange housing.

74
00:07:47.342 --> 00:07:48.927
Should take no more
than an hour.

75
00:07:49.011 --> 00:07:50.679
Skeeter.

76
00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:52.598
You can’t bring Skeeter
in here.

77
00:07:52.681 --> 00:07:56.059
Let them poke and prod you.
It’s no big deal.

78
00:07:56.143 --> 00:07:57.769
I’ll see you in an hour.

79
00:07:59.688 --> 00:08:03.025
Hey. don’t be a big baby.

80
00:08:03.108 --> 00:08:04.902
-Thanks. Doctor.
-You’re welcome.

81
00:08:04.985 --> 00:08:07.863
John. the examination room
is just down the hall.

82
00:08:07.946 --> 00:08:10.073
Psych evaluator Hackman.

83
00:08:10.157 --> 00:08:12.284
dial 617.

84
00:08:12.367 --> 00:08:16.455
Psych evaluator Hackman
dial 617.

85
00:08:19.082 --> 00:08:21.793
No readings indicated
a methane gas pocket?

86
00:08:21.877 --> 00:08:23.212
So you’re saying.

87
00:08:23.295 --> 00:08:25.047
as general manager
of this facility.

88
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.341
that this was
out of the blue?

89
00:08:27.424 --> 00:08:29.343
Completely out of the blue. sir.

90
00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:31.929
We think the gas built up behind
the stoping shields

91
00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:34.681
where our PDM sensors
couldn’t pick it up.

92
00:08:34.765 --> 00:08:36.475
I’m briefing the prime minister
in 20 minutes.

93
00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:38.060
Listen carefully.

94
00:08:38.143 --> 00:08:40.103
No one goes in any
of the tunnels

95
00:08:40.187 --> 00:08:42.689
until that gas
is drilled and capped.

96
00:08:42.773 --> 00:08:44.858
Understood. sir.
Understood.

97
00:08:44.942 --> 00:08:47.819
Let me ask you.
how do we drill and cap

98
00:08:47.903 --> 00:08:50.572
a methane pocket
without a wellhead?

99
00:08:52.241 --> 00:08:53.909
I’ll get back to you.

100
00:08:57.287 --> 00:08:59.122
Get me the air force base
in Winnipeg.

101
00:08:59.206 --> 00:09:01.750
officer in charge
of civilian emergencies.

102
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:08.090
Airlift a 30-ton gas wellhead?
Impossible.

103
00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:10.801
And there’s no runway
up at Katka to land a C-130 on.

104
00:09:10.884 --> 00:09:12.386
and our largest choppers
are Chinooks.

105
00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:14.805
which can’t carry
a 30-ton wellhead.

106
00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:17.307
Payloads of that nature
have to go by truck.

107
00:09:21.395 --> 00:09:23.897
Jill. that young field officer
in Winnipeg is supposed

108
00:09:23.981 --> 00:09:25.857
to know everything
about ice road transports

109
00:09:25.941 --> 00:09:27.276
up to the northern mines?

110
00:09:27.359 --> 00:09:28.860
Max Tully?
-Yes. him.

111
00:09:28.944 --> 00:09:30.779
The prime minister
will see you now.

112
00:09:30.862 --> 00:09:32.447
Just a sec.

113
00:09:32.531 --> 00:09:34.199
Max Tully?

114
00:09:35.409 --> 00:09:37.119
Mr. Goldenrod!

115
00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:39.037
What?

116
00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.043
I’m Max Tully
with Mining Safety.

117
00:09:45.127 --> 00:09:47.296
Could I have a word with you?
It’s about Katka Mine.

118
00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:49.131
What about Katka?

119
00:09:49.214 --> 00:09:51.133
This morning.
tunnel six collapsed.

120
00:09:51.216 --> 00:09:53.010
I need an 18-foot gas wellhead.

121
00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:56.013
300 feet of pipe delivered
up there in under 30 hours.

122
00:09:56.096 --> 00:10:00.392
Eighteen-foot gas wellhead
and 300 feet of pipe?

123
00:10:00.475 --> 00:10:02.853
Goddamn. that’s a hell
of a lot of weight. son.

124
00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:05.439
-Can you make it happen?
-What do I look like. God?

125
00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:07.065
We’re three weeks into April.

126
00:10:07.149 --> 00:10:09.109
All my drivers are on their way
to Hawaii.

127
00:10:09.192 --> 00:10:11.695
or wherever the hell it is that
they go during the off-season.

128
00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:14.156
Say. for conversation’s sake.
you have replacements.

129
00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:16.700
We’ll say for conversation’s
sake that these rigs have wings.

130
00:10:16.783 --> 00:10:18.660
What have you been smoking?

131
00:10:18.744 --> 00:10:21.455
March 10th. the season ended.
That’s five weeks ago.

132
00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:24.082
Didn’t old-timers back in the
’60s drive the lake into April?

133
00:10:24.166 --> 00:10:26.209
Yeah. and most of them died
doing it.

134
00:10:26.293 --> 00:10:28.045
So it’s really
that dangerous.

135
00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:29.713
Yeah. It’s that dangerous.

136
00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:31.798
Okay. okay.
It’s a stupid idea.

137
00:10:31.882 --> 00:10:33.383
Sorry for asking.

138
00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:39.639
Hey. hey. kid.
Come here.

139
00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:45.520
I know all the miners
up there in Katka.

140
00:10:45.604 --> 00:10:47.397
I know their families.

141
00:10:47.481 --> 00:10:50.359
So it’s personal with me.

142
00:10:50.442 --> 00:10:54.237
If I can get drivers
and a mechanic...

143
00:10:54.321 --> 00:10:55.822
let’s say 3:00 this afternoon.

144
00:10:55.906 --> 00:10:58.033
and if you can get
the provincial government

145
00:10:58.116 --> 00:10:59.868
to open up the ice road.

146
00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:02.162
two very big ifs...

147
00:11:05.749 --> 00:11:06.917
we’ll do it.

148
00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:09.336
Thank you.

149
00:11:12.964 --> 00:11:14.132
Shit.

150
00:11:17.469 --> 00:11:19.596
Hi. Um...

151
00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:25.227
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

152
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.062
I brought my brother in
this morning.

153
00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:29.064
Vocational rehab?

154
00:11:29.147 --> 00:11:30.690
McCann. 813.

155
00:11:30.774 --> 00:11:32.234
He’s still being evaluated. sir.

156
00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:36.071
The doctor said an hour.
It’s been two and a half.

157
00:11:36.154 --> 00:11:37.614
We’re a little
short-staffed today.

158
00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:38.698
so please take a seat.

159
00:11:40.617 --> 00:11:42.536
Hey! Sir?

160
00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:44.204
Sir!

161
00:11:44.287 --> 00:11:45.747
Get Security on 2-East. please.

162
00:11:50.127 --> 00:11:51.711
Hey. bro.

163
00:11:53.255 --> 00:11:54.673
What’s happening?

164
00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:56.716
What is all this?

165
00:12:01.471 --> 00:12:03.223
Oh. geez.

166
00:12:04.766 --> 00:12:06.226
What is going on here?

167
00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:08.395
Xanax and Lexapro. right?

168
00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:10.397
Probably some Oxy
for good measure?

169
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.149
You know.
to take the edge off?

170
00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:14.401
-They’re for PTSD.
-I know what they’re for.

171
00:12:14.484 --> 00:12:16.403
Did you ask for these. Gurty?

172
00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:19.156
He has insomnia. hypertension.
makes inappropriate outbursts.

173
00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:21.491
Oh. kiss my Irish ass.

174
00:12:21.575 --> 00:12:24.202
Post-traumatic stress disorder
is real.

175
00:12:24.286 --> 00:12:25.954
I can Section 502 him.

176
00:12:26.037 --> 00:12:27.873
Do it.

177
00:12:27.956 --> 00:12:29.416
The press’ll love
another story

178
00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:31.543
about how the VA
overprescribes opioids

179
00:12:31.626 --> 00:12:32.878
to America’s heroes.

180
00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:35.297
You are making
a grave mistake.

181
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.841
You try and stop us
from leaving here. so are you.

182
00:12:40.469 --> 00:12:41.803
Wait. wait. wait. wait.

183
00:12:41.887 --> 00:12:43.263
Here. put this on.

184
00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:45.390
It’s cold.

185
00:12:47.184 --> 00:12:49.144
Wait. here. Here.

186
00:12:52.564 --> 00:12:54.191
Come on. your pants.

187
00:13:22.761 --> 00:13:23.970
Ken-- Kenworth.

188
00:13:24.054 --> 00:13:25.305
More Ken.

189
00:13:25.388 --> 00:13:27.933
Take us great that owned we.

190
00:13:28.016 --> 00:13:30.519
-We.
-Sure. sure.

191
00:13:30.602 --> 00:13:33.522
It would be great if we owned
our own rig.

192
00:13:33.605 --> 00:13:35.315
Did you win the lottery?

193
00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:38.485
Did you happen to win
the Pick-6 and not tell me?

194
00:13:38.568 --> 00:13:41.196
This thing costs 200 grand.
Gurty.

195
00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.990
200.

196
00:14:50.056 --> 00:14:51.975
Ever been to Winnipeg.
Gurty?

197
00:14:52.976 --> 00:14:54.811
It’s just 70 miles.

198
00:14:57.981 --> 00:15:00.567
"Win a pig."

199
00:15:01.276 --> 00:15:03.445
We might. partner.

200
00:15:03.528 --> 00:15:07.574
With any luck.
today we might just win a pig.

201
00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:15.415
News all day. every day.

202
00:15:15.498 --> 00:15:18.001
Our top story:
twin explosions rocked

203
00:15:18.084 --> 00:15:20.378
northern Manitoba’s Katka mine
this morning.

204
00:15:20.462 --> 00:15:21.963
killing eight miners

205
00:15:22.047 --> 00:15:23.965
and leaving 26 more
unaccounted for.

206
00:15:24.049 --> 00:15:27.177
The cause of the explosion
has not been determined.

207
00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.346
Hi. I’m calling from
Trapper Transpo in Winnipeg.

208
00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:30.889
We’re in an emergency
and need drivers.

209
00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:32.515
Tully. give me 50 bucks.
You got 50 bucks?

210
00:15:32.599 --> 00:15:34.601
-Yeah. I do.
-One of my drivers

211
00:15:34.684 --> 00:15:37.228
-just became available. Thanks.
-Fantastic. What’s it for?

212
00:15:37.312 --> 00:15:38.980
-Bail.
-What?

213
00:15:39.064 --> 00:15:40.607
Told you this wasn’t
going to be easy.

214
00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:48.865
Sunglasses and keys.

215
00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:51.201
You protest
and throw rocks again.

216
00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:53.328
we’ll arrest you again.

217
00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:56.373
We’re going to keep doing it
until you get off our land.

218
00:15:56.456 --> 00:15:58.375
The city owns
that parking lot.

219
00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:01.252
I was referring
to North America.

220
00:16:02.754 --> 00:16:03.963
See you soon.

221
00:16:16.393 --> 00:16:18.311
How’s the fight
for justice going?

222
00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:22.357
Keep building casinos.

223
00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.776
you’ll beat the white man
without a shot fired.

224
00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:31.908
You heard about the cave-in
up at Katka?

225
00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:33.993
Yeah. it was on
the TV in there.

226
00:16:34.077 --> 00:16:36.663
I still haven’t heard from Cody.
though. I’m worried sick.

227
00:16:37.831 --> 00:16:40.250
He’s on the list
of those missing.

228
00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:42.752
I’m putting together
a little rescue mission.

229
00:16:43.545 --> 00:16:44.671
Ice road?

230
00:16:44.754 --> 00:16:45.797
Yup.

231
00:16:49.259 --> 00:16:50.427
I’m in.

232
00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:14.367
Let’s get a head count.
Cody.

233
00:17:16.327 --> 00:17:17.412
One.

234
00:17:17.495 --> 00:17:18.913
Two.
-Three.

235
00:17:18.997 --> 00:17:21.291
-Four.
-Five.

236
00:17:21.374 --> 00:17:23.209
-Six.
-Seven.

237
00:17:23.293 --> 00:17:24.627
-Eight.
-Nine.

238
00:17:24.711 --> 00:17:26.004
-Ten
-Eleven.

239
00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:27.839
-Twelve.
-Thirteen.

240
00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.145
I got a wife and kids. Jim.

241
00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:43.813
How would I even
explain this to them?

242
00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:45.607
No one’s going to force you
to go. Dave.

243
00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:48.526
I understand.
it’s not for everyone. Thanks.

244
00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:50.320
-What do you got?
-Half are retired.

245
00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:52.030
half have never seen
an ice road.

246
00:17:52.113 --> 00:17:54.240
Next. there are two guys
up from North Dakota.

247
00:17:54.324 --> 00:17:55.784
Brothers.

248
00:17:56.451 --> 00:17:57.494
Thank you.

249
00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:03.500
Which one of you guys
is Mike McCann?

250
00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:05.210
I am.

251
00:18:05.293 --> 00:18:06.628
You’re the driver?
He’s the mechanic?

252
00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:08.087
Yup. One of the best.

253
00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:11.424
Says you had experience

254
00:18:11.508 --> 00:18:13.301
on the ice road
in the Northwest Territory.

255
00:18:13.384 --> 00:18:15.470
That’s pretty serious country.
What’d you drive?

256
00:18:15.553 --> 00:18:17.472
Anything on wheels.

257
00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:20.308
Says you’ve had 11 gigs
in the last eight years.

258
00:18:20.391 --> 00:18:22.352
which ain’t exactly
inspiring my confidence.

259
00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:25.271
There some reason
that you can’t hold down a job?

260
00:18:29.651 --> 00:18:32.362
My... My brother’s a veteran.

261
00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:34.489
Got injured in Iraq.

262
00:18:34.572 --> 00:18:36.825
He’s got this thing
called aphasia. which is--

263
00:18:36.908 --> 00:18:38.076
I know what it is.

264
00:18:38.159 --> 00:18:39.911
Long story short.

265
00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:42.038
for the past eight years
I’ve been his caretaker.

266
00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:44.624
for lack of a better word.
and...

267
00:18:44.707 --> 00:18:46.125
-And we--
-I get it. I get it.

268
00:18:46.209 --> 00:18:47.418
I ain’t got time.
What’s his name?

269
00:18:47.502 --> 00:18:48.837
Call him Gurty.

270
00:18:49.587 --> 00:18:51.172
Gurty. Hey.

271
00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:53.716
Gurty. Jim Goldenrod.

272
00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.718
Grab your tool set.
follow me.

273
00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:06.521
Right here.

274
00:19:06.604 --> 00:19:08.481
I want you to pull
the rocker arm shaft.

275
00:19:09.607 --> 00:19:11.109
I’m going to time you.

276
00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:17.574
Say when.

277
00:19:20.243 --> 00:19:21.244
-Go.
-

278
00:19:41.222 --> 00:19:42.557
Sweet Jesus.

279
00:19:46.394 --> 00:19:47.979
Okay. Tully.

280
00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:50.857
send everybody else home
and call Katka.

281
00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.984
-I got my crew.
- Where’s Tantoo?

282
00:19:53.067 --> 00:19:54.986
She’s re-parking
somebody else’s rig.

283
00:20:02.869 --> 00:20:04.245
She seems
a little young.

284
00:20:08.499 --> 00:20:11.044
-I’ll have contracts drawn up.
-Thank you.

285
00:20:14.297 --> 00:20:15.381
Enough.

286
00:20:15.465 --> 00:20:19.093
Anyone not out by now
isn’t coming out.

287
00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.683
You guys hearing that?

288
00:20:25.767 --> 00:20:27.977
- What is that?

289
00:20:32.148 --> 00:20:33.775
That sounds like tap code.

290
00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:37.403
-You men. give us a hand.
-

291
00:20:37.487 --> 00:20:41.991
Somebody had to have been
in the Army. Navy. Cub Scouts.

292
00:20:42.075 --> 00:20:45.370
-

293
00:20:51.459 --> 00:20:53.044
What are they saying. Cody?

294
00:20:53.127 --> 00:20:54.879
"How many are alive?"

295
00:20:54.963 --> 00:20:56.965
Look. if you do hear something.

296
00:20:57.048 --> 00:20:59.050
-you call me. all right?
-Yes. sir.

297
00:21:08.142 --> 00:21:09.519
-Uh...

298
00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:12.605
26... alive.

299
00:21:12.689 --> 00:21:14.440
Fred. listen to me.
Listen to me.

300
00:21:14.524 --> 00:21:16.484
You tell them we’re going
to cap that methane

301
00:21:16.567 --> 00:21:19.112
with a wellhead. all right?
And then we’re going to blast.

302
00:21:19.195 --> 00:21:21.864
You tell them those wellheads
are coming ASAP. all right?

303
00:21:21.948 --> 00:21:23.449
-Okay.
-Okay.

304
00:21:30.331 --> 00:21:32.792
Wellheads arrive ASAP.

305
00:21:32.875 --> 00:21:35.253
What do they mean. ASAP?

306
00:21:35.336 --> 00:21:36.421
Six hours?

307
00:21:37.213 --> 00:21:38.214
Twelve hours?

308
00:21:38.297 --> 00:21:39.799
What if it’s 30?

309
00:21:39.882 --> 00:21:41.592
Then we’re dead.

310
00:21:47.265 --> 00:21:49.684
The 26 includes Lampard.

311
00:21:50.768 --> 00:21:51.894
Yup.

312
00:21:51.978 --> 00:21:53.146
Mankins?

313
00:21:54.939 --> 00:21:57.025
He’s alive.

314
00:21:57.775 --> 00:22:00.153
So the question is time.

315
00:22:00.236 --> 00:22:03.239
I mean. no one’s ever lasted
over 30 hours under permafrost.

316
00:22:06.701 --> 00:22:09.120
Well. the government’s
got that ice road open.

317
00:22:09.203 --> 00:22:14.000
Safety supervisor guy. he’s even
managed to secure transpo.

318
00:22:15.418 --> 00:22:16.753
Jim Goldenrod.

319
00:22:17.837 --> 00:22:20.006
If Jim Goldenrod believes
25-ton wellheads

320
00:22:20.089 --> 00:22:22.341
can roll across
a frozen lake in April.

321
00:22:22.425 --> 00:22:24.927
I suppose we should
believe it too.

322
00:22:25.011 --> 00:22:27.889
All right.
These wellheads are beasts.

323
00:22:27.972 --> 00:22:30.808
Eighteen feet long.
25 ton heavy.

324
00:22:30.892 --> 00:22:33.561
We got three rigs.
all identically equipped

325
00:22:33.644 --> 00:22:36.814
so that we can achieve
tactical redundancy.

326
00:22:36.898 --> 00:22:39.275
We’re taking every chance
to save those miners’ lives.

327
00:22:39.358 --> 00:22:43.112
-Tactical re-what-ancy?
- Redundancy.

328
00:22:43.196 --> 00:22:45.448
Each rig doesn’t need the others
to complete the mission.

329
00:22:45.531 --> 00:22:47.533
Gold star to the man
from North Dakota.

330
00:22:48.618 --> 00:22:50.912
One. two. three.
The gold one is mine.

331
00:22:50.995 --> 00:22:52.997
You two can paper/rock/scissors
for the red one.

332
00:22:53.081 --> 00:22:55.124
She’s the one
with the comfy seats.

333
00:22:58.086 --> 00:22:59.337
It’s all yours.

334
00:23:01.547 --> 00:23:02.632
The contracts.

335
00:23:02.715 --> 00:23:03.883
-One for you.
-Thanks.

336
00:23:03.966 --> 00:23:05.760
One for you. And you.

337
00:23:05.843 --> 00:23:08.387
Two hundred thousand
split four ways.

338
00:23:08.471 --> 00:23:10.431
Any questions?

339
00:23:10.515 --> 00:23:13.559
What happens to anyone that
doesn’t make it? To their money?

340
00:23:13.643 --> 00:23:15.812
Paragraph four. Their share goes
to those that do.

341
00:23:15.895 --> 00:23:17.939
-That’s pretty cold.
-Sounds fair to me.

342
00:23:18.022 --> 00:23:19.023
Who’s that guy?

343
00:23:19.774 --> 00:23:21.234
Mr. Varnay.

344
00:23:22.485 --> 00:23:25.488
Tom Varnay. Katka International
Insurance Group.

345
00:23:25.571 --> 00:23:27.865
Tully. these are my trucks.
I say who goes.

346
00:23:27.949 --> 00:23:29.700
They’re your trucks.
but it’s Katka’s insurance.

347
00:23:29.784 --> 00:23:31.619
So if one goes in the lake.
it’s on Katka.

348
00:23:31.702 --> 00:23:34.539
-He’s not taking a cut?
-No. no. no. Absolutely not.

349
00:23:34.622 --> 00:23:37.792
I’m just along for the ride and
to protect Katka’s investment.

350
00:23:37.875 --> 00:23:41.212
All right. you’ll ride with
Tantoo in the black Kenworth.

351
00:23:41.295 --> 00:23:43.631
Put your gear in there.
You two will find safety bags

352
00:23:43.714 --> 00:23:45.466
in the locker area.
It’s time to load up.

353
00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:47.844
We’ll fuel the rigs
and we’ll push in 15.

354
00:23:49.262 --> 00:23:51.931
Thank you. Thanks.

355
00:23:52.014 --> 00:23:53.474
-Thank you.
-Hello.

356
00:23:57.311 --> 00:23:59.355
Fifty grand apiece times two.

357
00:23:59.438 --> 00:24:01.399
That’s more than enough
for a down payment

358
00:24:01.482 --> 00:24:03.025
on a rig like this.

359
00:24:04.902 --> 00:24:08.114
Sorry I ripped up your brochure.
by the way.

360
00:24:08.197 --> 00:24:10.908
I’m going to put Skeeter
up front with us. okay?

361
00:24:10.992 --> 00:24:12.535
Where are you?

362
00:24:16.747 --> 00:24:18.332
Tantoo. is it?

363
00:24:18.416 --> 00:24:19.917
Tully says you’re Cree.

364
00:24:20.668 --> 00:24:22.003
What’s your name mean?

365
00:24:24.505 --> 00:24:26.090
Name mean...

366
00:24:26.174 --> 00:24:27.758
"like to drive alone."

367
00:24:31.596 --> 00:24:33.472
Mount up!

368
00:24:33.556 --> 00:24:35.349
Use the head
if you have to now.

369
00:24:35.433 --> 00:24:36.934
We’re on a bull run.

370
00:24:37.935 --> 00:24:39.312
See you on the flip side.
Tully.

371
00:25:23.064 --> 00:25:26.108
We’ll run with 200-foot
separations.

372
00:25:26.192 --> 00:25:27.735
leapfrogging every few hours.

373
00:25:27.818 --> 00:25:30.196
-Everyone good with that?
-Yup.

374
00:25:31.405 --> 00:25:32.740
Affirmativo.

375
00:25:32.823 --> 00:25:33.866
First leg:

376
00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:35.826
Lake Winnipeg ice road.

377
00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:37.954
About 300 miles.
20 hours.

378
00:25:38.037 --> 00:25:40.665
Second leg: up and over
Manitoba Pass.

379
00:25:40.748 --> 00:25:45.086
Third leg: Manitonka ice road
to Old Manitonka Bridge.

380
00:25:45.169 --> 00:25:46.879
Twenty-three hours total.

381
00:25:46.963 --> 00:25:49.048
What’s wrong
with New Manitonka?

382
00:25:49.131 --> 00:25:50.925
The new bridge
would be preferred.

383
00:25:51.008 --> 00:25:53.219
but getting up to New Manitonka
is another 90 kilometers.

384
00:25:53.302 --> 00:25:56.597
That puts us outside the miners’
oxygen window.

385
00:25:56.681 --> 00:25:58.891
Old Manitonka
was built in the ’60s.

386
00:25:58.975 --> 00:26:00.977
so that’s rated 75.000 pounds?

387
00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:03.938
Yup. We’re going to be
shaving it close.

388
00:26:04.021 --> 00:26:05.564
Here we go. people.

389
00:26:32.675 --> 00:26:34.218
Oh. shit.

390
00:26:35.428 --> 00:26:37.305
You said 120 meters that way.

391
00:26:37.388 --> 00:26:38.556
80 that way?

392
00:26:38.639 --> 00:26:40.099
Give or take.

393
00:26:40.182 --> 00:26:41.976
Pretty decent
atmospheric volume.

394
00:26:42.059 --> 00:26:44.687
Yeah. except we got 26 sets
of lungs down here.

395
00:26:51.402 --> 00:26:54.530
Hey. Jim.
-Yeah.

396
00:26:54.613 --> 00:26:57.033
I thought I heard every
trucker’s expression.

397
00:26:57.116 --> 00:26:59.493
so what the heck’s a bull run?

398
00:26:59.577 --> 00:27:01.954
Bull run?
Well. back in Minnesota.

399
00:27:02.038 --> 00:27:04.248
all the livestock haulers
never used to stop.

400
00:27:04.332 --> 00:27:06.167
because bulls. you see.
got to be standing

401
00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:07.918
when they’re being transported.

402
00:27:08.002 --> 00:27:09.962
As soon as one gets tired
and lies down.

403
00:27:10.046 --> 00:27:11.672
then the others
will step on him and kill him.

404
00:27:11.756 --> 00:27:13.090
All livestock haulers
know this.

405
00:27:13.174 --> 00:27:14.592
so they never stop
for anything.

406
00:27:14.675 --> 00:27:16.469
Ah. I see.

407
00:27:16.552 --> 00:27:18.262
I’m learning
something tonight.

408
00:27:21.474 --> 00:27:24.101
And a White

409
00:27:24.185 --> 00:27:27.146
In sight

410
00:27:29.106 --> 00:27:31.776
Make it home tonight

411
00:27:31.859 --> 00:27:34.445
Like a month

412
00:27:34.528 --> 00:27:37.698
Goodbye

413
00:27:37.782 --> 00:27:39.617
A lot of women

414
00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:42.203
Some of the guys

415
00:27:53.756 --> 00:27:56.592
Running down the track

416
00:27:56.675 --> 00:27:59.970
He ain’t coming back

417
00:28:03.224 --> 00:28:05.017
Hey. Jim. how are you feeling
about the ice?

418
00:28:07.812 --> 00:28:10.272
Cold. hard and stiff.

419
00:28:10.356 --> 00:28:14.026
I wish we weren’t running
in bright sunshine tomorrow.

420
00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:16.237
Said hello
To the southland

421
00:28:56.527 --> 00:28:57.778
You want a sandwich?

422
00:28:58.737 --> 00:29:00.489
You haven’t eaten
since we left.

423
00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:02.867
You’ll know
when I’m hungry.

424
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:04.243
It’s very unattractive.

425
00:29:05.035 --> 00:29:06.287
You get cranky?

426
00:29:06.996 --> 00:29:08.247
Worse. I act white.

427
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:15.504
Tully said you and Goldenrod
had a falling out.

428
00:29:15.588 --> 00:29:17.423
That wasn’t a big deal.

429
00:29:17.506 --> 00:29:19.717
Sounded like a big deal.

430
00:29:20.968 --> 00:29:23.512
He fired me. I got upset
and took a swing at him.

431
00:29:23.596 --> 00:29:24.680
It’s old news.

432
00:29:28.767 --> 00:29:30.853
How’s that Kenworth. boys?

433
00:29:31.645 --> 00:29:33.564
She’s a fine ride. Jim.

434
00:29:33.647 --> 00:29:35.858
Thinking we might get one
just like it.

435
00:29:37.401 --> 00:29:39.028
Well. what you gonna call her?

436
00:29:39.111 --> 00:29:40.779
-Take your time. boys.

437
00:29:40.863 --> 00:29:43.324
Naming a big rig’s
a sacred thing.

438
00:29:43.407 --> 00:29:45.701
What’ll we name our truck.
Gurty?

439
00:29:47.119 --> 00:29:49.580
Truck-truck-truck.

440
00:29:49.663 --> 00:29:51.707
You hear that?

441
00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:53.417
"Truck-truck-truck."
I like it.

442
00:29:53.501 --> 00:29:54.960
It’s got a ring to it.

443
00:30:00.174 --> 00:30:01.926
It is beautiful
out here.

444
00:30:07.389 --> 00:30:09.642
Is this really
that dangerous?

445
00:30:09.725 --> 00:30:11.060
It doesn’t seem
like a big deal.

446
00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:14.188
What exactly do you do?

447
00:30:15.481 --> 00:30:17.900
I’m an actuary.
A risk assessment professional.

448
00:30:17.983 --> 00:30:19.443
if we’re being formal.

449
00:30:19.527 --> 00:30:21.987
Well. Mr. Varnay.

450
00:30:22.071 --> 00:30:25.407
hauling heavy cargo
on ice in April is a big deal.

451
00:30:25.491 --> 00:30:27.868
See Custer’s head there?

452
00:30:28.869 --> 00:30:30.955
Tips us off
to pressure waves.

453
00:30:31.038 --> 00:30:33.916
You go too fast.
you create a pressure wave.

454
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:35.876
In you go.

455
00:30:37.002 --> 00:30:38.504
You go too slow.
the ice can’t handle

456
00:30:38.587 --> 00:30:40.714
the pounds per square inch
on your tire.

457
00:30:41.882 --> 00:30:43.092
In you go.

458
00:31:05.406 --> 00:31:07.908
What the hell was that? Over.

459
00:31:07.992 --> 00:31:10.202
Sounds like my head gasket.

460
00:31:12.288 --> 00:31:15.082
Come on. kid. Come on!

461
00:31:29.013 --> 00:31:31.765
Sweet Jesus.
that ain’t good.

462
00:31:41.859 --> 00:31:42.943
Shit.

463
00:31:51.952 --> 00:31:53.829
Shit.

464
00:31:53.912 --> 00:31:55.289
Whoa. what the hell
are you doing?

465
00:31:55.372 --> 00:31:57.082
Going back.

466
00:31:57.166 --> 00:31:58.959
I thought we weren’t stopping
for anything.

467
00:31:59.043 --> 00:32:00.419
You know. all that
"bull run" stuff?

468
00:32:00.502 --> 00:32:02.963
I said. we’re going back.

469
00:32:03.047 --> 00:32:04.632
Goddamn it!

470
00:32:04.715 --> 00:32:07.384
-

471
00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:35.746
Gurty’s going to run diagnostics
while we hook up.

472
00:32:35.829 --> 00:32:37.331
We’ll pull together.

473
00:32:37.414 --> 00:32:40.459
Use the nylon snatch pulleys
on the rear

474
00:32:40.542 --> 00:32:42.086
so the rigs can swing.

475
00:32:52.429 --> 00:32:55.224
Is this...
this going to work?

476
00:32:55.307 --> 00:32:58.769
How far are we gonna...
gonna tow him?

477
00:32:58.852 --> 00:33:00.312
All the way to the mine?

478
00:33:02.064 --> 00:33:03.565
Do us all a favor.
Mr. Varnay.

479
00:33:03.649 --> 00:33:05.359
and get back in your truck.

480
00:33:35.556 --> 00:33:37.558
Shit. Come on.

481
00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:49.319
Oh...

482
00:33:50.195 --> 00:33:51.739
Gurty!

483
00:33:51.822 --> 00:33:53.115
Clear out.

484
00:33:53.907 --> 00:33:55.451
What happened?

485
00:33:55.534 --> 00:33:56.994
Rear trailer tires went in.

486
00:33:57.077 --> 00:33:58.954
-

487
00:33:59.037 --> 00:34:00.372
Oh. shit.

488
00:34:05.002 --> 00:34:06.754
What the hell’s going on?

489
00:34:07.629 --> 00:34:08.797
Come on. Jim.

490
00:34:50.964 --> 00:34:54.343
Jim! Jim! Jim!

491
00:34:54.426 --> 00:34:57.387
Tow line’s got me!
Cut me loose. My leg’s broken.

492
00:35:00.182 --> 00:35:01.767
Cut me loose
or you’re all going in!

493
00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:03.018
The tow line’s got me

494
00:35:03.101 --> 00:35:04.144
and my leg’s broken. Do it.

495
00:35:05.813 --> 00:35:07.856
-Do it!
-I can’t.

496
00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:09.274
Do it! Do it!

497
00:35:14.363 --> 00:35:15.781
Jesus.

498
00:35:24.498 --> 00:35:25.582
Holy shit!

499
00:35:29.878 --> 00:35:31.421
It’s spreading out.

500
00:35:32.339 --> 00:35:33.966
Meaning what?

501
00:35:34.049 --> 00:35:36.510
Meaning it’s going
to keep cracking for two.

502
00:35:36.593 --> 00:35:38.387
maybe three thousand meters.

503
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:39.847
That’s over a mile.

504
00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:41.807
We’ll outrun it.
Let’s move!

505
00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:43.517
We got to unhook first.

506
00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.394
There’s no time.

507
00:35:45.477 --> 00:35:48.146
We’re going to have to run
tied together. Go!

508
00:35:55.612 --> 00:35:57.197
Get your harness on.

509
00:36:16.133 --> 00:36:18.969
Mike. come in. We got
to hike up the speed. Over.

510
00:36:19.052 --> 00:36:20.053
Roger.

511
00:36:43.952 --> 00:36:45.954
Mike. come in.
We got to run faster.

512
00:36:46.038 --> 00:36:48.540
Roger. Gurty. running board.

513
00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:56.840
-Get out. On the running board.
-Why?

514
00:36:56.924 --> 00:36:58.508
So if we go through.
we can jump clear.

515
00:37:18.445 --> 00:37:20.155
Got a pressure wave
ahead of me.

516
00:37:21.531 --> 00:37:23.367
Well. I got one hell
of an ice crack behind me here.

517
00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:24.993
so how do you want to die?

518
00:37:32.584 --> 00:37:35.462
Slush bed at 200 yards.
Get in and buckle up.

519
00:37:37.798 --> 00:37:41.009
Hang on. pal.
This is going to get ugly.

520
00:37:47.641 --> 00:37:49.059
This is not good.

521
00:37:49.142 --> 00:37:51.019
This is not good.
This is not good!

522
00:37:58.068 --> 00:37:59.611
I don’t like this!

523
00:38:04.241 --> 00:38:07.077
-Shit!
-

524
00:38:21.508 --> 00:38:22.759
I’ve got your seat belt.

525
00:38:22.843 --> 00:38:25.345
You okay. pal?

526
00:38:40.569 --> 00:38:42.195
We’re finished.

527
00:38:53.081 --> 00:38:54.750
It stopped.

528
00:38:58.754 --> 00:38:59.755
Yeah.

529
00:38:59.838 --> 00:39:01.506
It stopped!

530
00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:03.592
We capsized for a reason.

531
00:39:03.675 --> 00:39:07.596
Now our weight’s displaced
evenly instead of on the tires.

532
00:39:10.515 --> 00:39:13.226
So based on seven liters
per minute. per man...

533
00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:15.062
Seven liters?

534
00:39:15.145 --> 00:39:16.897
That’s all a grown man
breathes?

535
00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:20.484
When at rest. the figure doubles
with physical exertion.

536
00:39:20.567 --> 00:39:23.904
Hey. Cody.
can I ask you something?

537
00:39:23.987 --> 00:39:26.406
-Sure.
-When the mine blew up.

538
00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:28.533
I said we hit
a methane pocket

539
00:39:28.617 --> 00:39:30.827
and you said
"That’s impossible."

540
00:39:30.911 --> 00:39:32.079
Why?

541
00:39:36.833 --> 00:39:38.251
It’s still settling.

542
00:39:55.977 --> 00:39:58.063
Air compressor.

543
00:39:59.147 --> 00:40:00.816
Thank God.
they’re coming through.

544
00:40:05.862 --> 00:40:07.030
Failed.

545
00:40:10.367 --> 00:40:12.702
Hey. what’s the story. Cody?

546
00:40:13.954 --> 00:40:17.040
Yeah. What’d they say?

547
00:40:25.132 --> 00:40:27.551
They say they’re still
working on it.

548
00:40:31.638 --> 00:40:32.848
-Cody.
- Yeah?

549
00:40:39.938 --> 00:40:41.690
You didn’t answer
my question.

550
00:40:41.773 --> 00:40:44.276
Why is it impossible
we hit a methane pocket?

551
00:40:49.406 --> 00:40:51.700
Because I was told
it would never happen.

552
00:40:51.783 --> 00:40:53.034
By who?

553
00:40:53.118 --> 00:40:54.744
Who told you that?

554
00:40:57.247 --> 00:40:58.790
Cody.

555
00:41:03.837 --> 00:41:06.089
Easy. boys! Easy! Get him out!

556
00:41:06.173 --> 00:41:07.966
Easy!

557
00:41:12.929 --> 00:41:14.264
Cody!

558
00:41:16.975 --> 00:41:19.895
-Whoa! Whoa!
-

559
00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:42.000
SOS. SOS.

560
00:41:42.083 --> 00:41:43.752
41.40.

561
00:41:43.835 --> 00:41:45.879
Ice road north of 53.

562
00:41:45.962 --> 00:41:47.672
Kenworth through the ice.

563
00:41:47.756 --> 00:41:50.091
Repeat:
Kenworth through the ice.

564
00:41:50.175 --> 00:41:52.010
Copy. Are there survivors?

565
00:41:52.093 --> 00:41:53.970
Negative.

566
00:41:54.054 --> 00:41:56.890
We are responding.
thank you.

567
00:41:56.973 --> 00:41:59.809
Wait. wait. wait. wait.
What about us?

568
00:41:59.893 --> 00:42:01.686
What about us?

569
00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.484
We’re heading back. right?

570
00:42:09.152 --> 00:42:11.154
-Back?
-Yeah.

571
00:42:11.238 --> 00:42:13.156
That’s what I said.

572
00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:15.951
The ice is bound to be thinner
to the south. not thicker.

573
00:42:16.034 --> 00:42:17.786
We still have two
deliverable wellheads.

574
00:42:17.869 --> 00:42:19.454
Tactical redundancy.
remember?

575
00:42:19.537 --> 00:42:21.748
And we’re more
than halfway there.

576
00:42:21.831 --> 00:42:22.999
What do you think. Gurty?

577
00:42:24.751 --> 00:42:27.128
Attaboy. Are you coming with.
Tantoo?

578
00:42:27.212 --> 00:42:29.631
-Hell. yeah.
-What? This is ridiculous.

579
00:42:29.714 --> 00:42:31.549
You’re all going to die.

580
00:42:31.633 --> 00:42:32.884
You want to go back.
go back.

581
00:42:32.968 --> 00:42:35.720
I suggest you do it quick.

582
00:42:37.722 --> 00:42:38.974
Nichiiwad.

583
00:42:39.057 --> 00:42:40.558
The big one.

584
00:42:40.642 --> 00:42:42.352
Drop 50 degrees.

585
00:42:42.435 --> 00:42:45.647
we’ll pick up 8 to 10
centimeters of new ice.

586
00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:48.066
Let’s get the rigs upright
and haul ass.

587
00:42:48.149 --> 00:42:49.609
We’re back in business.

588
00:42:49.693 --> 00:42:52.195
You’re out of your minds.
All of you!

589
00:42:52.279 --> 00:42:53.571
Wait. wait. wait.

590
00:42:54.698 --> 00:42:56.700
It appears you’re the new
leader here. so--

591
00:42:56.783 --> 00:42:58.034
I’m not the leader
of anything.

592
00:42:58.118 --> 00:42:59.577
Everyone’s on their own.

593
00:42:59.661 --> 00:43:02.122
Fine. Whatever.

594
00:43:03.999 --> 00:43:06.876
You’re not curious
about back there. what happened?

595
00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:08.670
We saw what happened.

596
00:43:08.753 --> 00:43:11.381
No. I’m talking about
the seized-up engine.

597
00:43:14.301 --> 00:43:15.510
Go on.

598
00:43:17.762 --> 00:43:20.307
How well do you know her?
Tantoo?

599
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:23.101
Met her first time yesterday.
Why?

600
00:43:26.646 --> 00:43:28.690
Mind answering
a couple of questions?

601
00:43:30.233 --> 00:43:33.528
You worked for Jim Goldenrod.
what. two years?

602
00:43:33.611 --> 00:43:35.655
Two and a half.

603
00:43:37.198 --> 00:43:38.533
Why’d it end?

604
00:43:40.285 --> 00:43:43.038
I used his rig on the weekend
without permission.

605
00:43:43.121 --> 00:43:45.332
So you’re a thief.

606
00:43:45.415 --> 00:43:47.083
I’m not a thief.

607
00:43:47.167 --> 00:43:49.294
Hey. I was hauling banners
for a demon--

608
00:43:51.129 --> 00:43:52.881
What is this
your business?

609
00:43:52.964 --> 00:43:55.091
You weren’t a happy camper.
were you?

610
00:43:55.175 --> 00:43:56.176
When he fired you?

611
00:43:57.135 --> 00:44:00.388
No. I... Look. just--

612
00:44:00.472 --> 00:44:04.100
I’ve never seen a Kenworth with
less than 10k on the odometer

613
00:44:04.184 --> 00:44:07.812
-just up and quit. have you?
-No.

614
00:44:07.896 --> 00:44:10.357
Most diesel engines
don’t seize on their own.

615
00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:12.192
Unless they burn gasoline.

616
00:44:13.401 --> 00:44:15.403
What’s this about?

617
00:44:15.487 --> 00:44:18.448
You dosed Goldenrod’s rig with
gas while we were loading up.

618
00:44:18.531 --> 00:44:20.116
I saw you next to the pump.

619
00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.118
You said you were checking
the tire pressure.

620
00:44:22.202 --> 00:44:23.787
That is a goddamn lie.

621
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:26.498
You were going to take us
all out. weren’t you?

622
00:44:26.581 --> 00:44:28.500
So you could claim
the whole 200 grand.

623
00:44:28.583 --> 00:44:30.126
No. I don’t know what
you’re talking about.

624
00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:31.878
Who else. then?
It wasn’t me.

625
00:44:31.961 --> 00:44:33.671
Wasn’t Gurty.
Wasn’t him.

626
00:44:33.755 --> 00:44:35.799
He works for the company
that’s paying us.

627
00:44:35.882 --> 00:44:38.134
This is not about the money
for me. you idiots!

628
00:44:38.218 --> 00:44:40.053
God. my brother
is in that mine.

629
00:44:40.136 --> 00:44:42.514
And the longer that we stand
here. the closer he is to dying.

630
00:44:42.597 --> 00:44:44.933
-so if you could just move--
-She’s lying.

631
00:44:45.016 --> 00:44:46.267
You can’t trust these people.

632
00:44:47.394 --> 00:44:49.687
Call Katka.
His name is Cody Mantooth.

633
00:44:49.771 --> 00:44:51.940
We have different fathers.

634
00:44:52.023 --> 00:44:55.068
God. "these people"?
You’re a racist asshole...

635
00:44:55.151 --> 00:44:57.487
-You’re not going anywhere.
-Look. just get out--

636
00:44:57.570 --> 00:44:59.364
-You’re not going anywhere.
-Fine.

637
00:44:59.447 --> 00:45:01.491
Hey. hey. hey.
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

638
00:45:11.418 --> 00:45:13.294
We call the company
and check your story.

639
00:45:13.378 --> 00:45:15.171
Yeah. and then
go fuck yourself.

640
00:45:15.255 --> 00:45:17.173
Tie her up. Gurty.

641
00:46:09.642 --> 00:46:11.227
Yeah. Tully. it’s Mike.

642
00:46:11.311 --> 00:46:12.896
I just heard about Goldenrod

643
00:46:12.979 --> 00:46:14.689
from County Emergency.
what happened?

644
00:46:14.772 --> 00:46:17.650
We think Tantoo dosed Jim’s rig
with gasoline.

645
00:46:17.734 --> 00:46:20.153
Are you kidding? That’s worse
than putting sugar in the tank.

646
00:46:20.236 --> 00:46:23.364
Contact Katka.
ask them if there’s a miner.

647
00:46:23.448 --> 00:46:26.075
Cody Mantooth.
on the missing list.

648
00:46:26.159 --> 00:46:28.203
-I’ll explain later.
-You got it.

649
00:46:40.548 --> 00:46:43.384
-We want to discuss options.
-Like what?

650
00:46:44.344 --> 00:46:46.012
Like decreasing
our numbers.

651
00:46:47.263 --> 00:46:49.057
I want to talk
to the folks upstairs.

652
00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:50.600
I want to talk to the bosses.

653
00:46:50.683 --> 00:46:52.143
You don’t know tap code.

654
00:46:52.227 --> 00:46:53.603
He does.

655
00:46:54.896 --> 00:46:56.898
You guys can’t be serious.

656
00:46:59.234 --> 00:47:00.610
It’s called triage.

657
00:47:00.693 --> 00:47:02.195
Hospitals do it
all the time.

658
00:47:03.863 --> 00:47:05.573
If we decrease our numbers
by one-third.

659
00:47:05.657 --> 00:47:07.283
our oxygen window increases by--

660
00:47:07.367 --> 00:47:09.452
We can do the math.

661
00:47:09.536 --> 00:47:11.663
Hospitals are
a bullshit analogy.

662
00:47:11.746 --> 00:47:15.792
Patients get triaged when it’s
determined they’d die anyway.

663
00:47:16.876 --> 00:47:18.336
And what about these guys?

664
00:47:18.419 --> 00:47:20.463
They’re not going
to make it till morning.

665
00:47:20.547 --> 00:47:22.465
Well. no one’s going for this.

666
00:47:22.549 --> 00:47:24.217
I agree. It’s nuts.

667
00:47:25.552 --> 00:47:27.637
-Say you’re wrong.
-Say we’re not.

668
00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:29.097
Say we put it to a vote.

669
00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:30.765
What’s he saying. Cody?

670
00:47:35.603 --> 00:47:37.438
They want to decrease
our numbers.

671
00:47:37.522 --> 00:47:39.107
Can’t be serious.

672
00:47:40.275 --> 00:47:42.068
Looks serious to me.
Claude.

673
00:47:42.151 --> 00:47:44.737
Nobody wants this. Barney.
Don’t make it personal.

674
00:47:44.821 --> 00:47:46.781
Hate to tell you. friend.

675
00:47:46.864 --> 00:47:48.491
this is about
as personal as it gets.

676
00:47:48.575 --> 00:47:50.410
Have you guys seen yourselves?

677
00:47:50.493 --> 00:47:52.745
Barney. that compound fracture
has sepsis in it.

678
00:47:52.829 --> 00:47:55.456
And you. Claude. how’s
that fever treating you?

679
00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:57.333
You’re not going to make it
another 12 hours.

680
00:47:57.417 --> 00:47:59.752
-What if we say no?
-It’s going to a vote.

681
00:47:59.836 --> 00:48:01.379
That’s like two foxes
and a chicken

682
00:48:01.462 --> 00:48:02.839
voting on what’s for dinner.

683
00:48:02.922 --> 00:48:05.800
I always knew
you were a prick. Mankins.

684
00:48:05.883 --> 00:48:08.386
I didn’t know until now
you were also a murderer.

685
00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:23.151
"Suggest decreasing our number."
What does that mean?

686
00:48:23.234 --> 00:48:25.028
They mean decreasing
their number.

687
00:48:25.111 --> 00:48:27.614
-Well. how?
-How do you think?

688
00:48:28.656 --> 00:48:29.782
No.

689
00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:32.160
What? No.

690
00:48:32.243 --> 00:48:34.579
No. that’s crazy.
I’m not taking part in this.

691
00:48:34.662 --> 00:48:36.956
We’re not calling the shots
down there. Fred.

692
00:48:45.173 --> 00:48:49.093
Hey. those trailers
smacked down hard.

693
00:48:49.177 --> 00:48:51.512
Gurty and I are going
to go check the loads.

694
00:48:51.596 --> 00:48:53.514
then we’ll push on.

695
00:48:55.016 --> 00:48:56.601
How’s she looking?

696
00:49:10.031 --> 00:49:11.240
Hey! Hey!

697
00:49:11.324 --> 00:49:13.284
-Hey!
- Help! Hey!

698
00:49:13.368 --> 00:49:15.286
- Open the damn door!

699
00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:17.747
Help! Help!
- Open the damn door!

700
00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:20.750
-

701
00:49:20.833 --> 00:49:22.043
Hey!

702
00:49:32.387 --> 00:49:34.180
Open this damn door!

703
00:49:54.075 --> 00:49:55.076
It was you.

704
00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:59.622
You piece of shit.
"Insurance actuary" my ass.

705
00:49:59.706 --> 00:50:01.499
What do you actually do
for Katka?

706
00:50:01.582 --> 00:50:03.918
Let’s just say I work in a...

707
00:50:04.001 --> 00:50:05.753
different department
of the company.

708
00:50:05.837 --> 00:50:07.630
Yeah. the sewer.

709
00:50:08.965 --> 00:50:11.884
Look. here’s the rules.

710
00:50:12.635 --> 00:50:13.886
You behave yourself.

711
00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:15.304
and you can stay
in the restraints

712
00:50:15.388 --> 00:50:17.682
those idiot truckers
put on you.

713
00:50:17.765 --> 00:50:19.892
But you get a little spirited.

714
00:50:19.976 --> 00:50:23.938
which I know is a problem
for you people.

715
00:50:24.021 --> 00:50:25.565
and I will hog-tie you

716
00:50:25.648 --> 00:50:27.817
and throw you in the rear.

717
00:50:38.453 --> 00:50:42.749
-Yeah?

718
00:50:42.832 --> 00:50:44.459
Mike. what’s your status?

719
00:50:44.542 --> 00:50:46.419
No. it’s Varnay.
We’re stuck in a storm.

720
00:50:46.502 --> 00:50:48.171
I’ve got an answer
on that Cody Mantooth...

721
00:50:48.254 --> 00:50:49.630
I can’t talk!

722
00:50:54.385 --> 00:50:56.804
Please work. Please work.

723
00:51:02.143 --> 00:51:04.061
She’s outfitted
with a heater unit.

724
00:51:04.145 --> 00:51:07.607
Hey. Gurty. how heavy do we
think this double mill pipe is?

725
00:51:07.690 --> 00:51:10.902
-Five mill double hundred.
-Huh?

726
00:51:13.237 --> 00:51:15.531
Three...four...zero.

727
00:51:15.615 --> 00:51:17.867
340 each?

728
00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:19.702
Grab hold of the end
of this one.

729
00:51:20.787 --> 00:51:22.455
We’re going
to punch that out.

730
00:51:22.538 --> 00:51:24.415
Punch pipe the pin post.

731
00:51:24.499 --> 00:51:26.042
My thoughts exactly.

732
00:52:05.164 --> 00:52:06.791
Easy.

733
00:52:06.874 --> 00:52:08.125
Easy.

734
00:52:14.465 --> 00:52:15.466
Easy.

735
00:52:17.885 --> 00:52:20.096
One. two. three.

736
00:52:27.436 --> 00:52:29.355
One. two. three.

737
00:52:38.739 --> 00:52:40.867
One. two. three.

738
00:52:42.952 --> 00:52:44.871
One. two. three.

739
00:53:47.808 --> 00:53:49.435
Yes!

740
00:53:52.396 --> 00:53:53.940
Oh. no!

741
00:53:55.900 --> 00:54:00.655
He took the phone.
the pistol. our gear bags.

742
00:54:00.738 --> 00:54:02.657
And the Too.

743
00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:04.533
And the what?

744
00:54:04.617 --> 00:54:06.243
Tantoo.

745
00:54:06.327 --> 00:54:08.079
Tantoo as well.

746
00:54:10.873 --> 00:54:12.708
Let’s figure this out.

747
00:55:40.212 --> 00:55:41.922
What’s the matter with you?

748
00:55:42.673 --> 00:55:43.966
Ease off!

749
00:56:07.948 --> 00:56:09.200
More!

750
00:56:09.283 --> 00:56:11.118
Hike up the pressure!

751
00:56:14.830 --> 00:56:16.665
Gurty!

752
00:56:16.749 --> 00:56:18.417
I said. more!

753
00:56:18.501 --> 00:56:19.835
More!

754
00:56:22.046 --> 00:56:23.422
-Geez.

755
00:56:23.506 --> 00:56:26.092
I said. more!

756
00:56:26.175 --> 00:56:28.010
-Mike!
-Yeah. I see it.

757
00:56:28.094 --> 00:56:29.428
It’s called a winch.

758
00:56:29.512 --> 00:56:32.348
Mike. welding’s a winter snap!

759
00:56:32.431 --> 00:56:33.849
What?

760
00:56:33.933 --> 00:56:36.560
Welding’s not cold!

761
00:56:36.644 --> 00:56:38.896
Just do it!

762
00:56:49.323 --> 00:56:51.242
Do you know why
we get fired?

763
00:56:51.325 --> 00:56:54.995
It’s not your disability.
It’s your freaking attitude.

764
00:56:56.413 --> 00:56:59.834
You probably didn’t take orders
before your disability.

765
00:57:04.839 --> 00:57:07.299
I don’t know
what’s going on here.

766
00:57:07.383 --> 00:57:09.969
but that prick.
he killed Goldenrod

767
00:57:10.052 --> 00:57:11.470
and he nearly killed us.

768
00:57:11.554 --> 00:57:13.639
He pinned it all on Tantoo.

769
00:57:13.722 --> 00:57:15.391
who’s out here
to save her brother.

770
00:57:15.474 --> 00:57:16.809
and we helped him.

771
00:57:17.726 --> 00:57:20.062
We have one chance. one chance

772
00:57:20.146 --> 00:57:23.732
to get out of this
and make this right.

773
00:57:23.816 --> 00:57:25.484
And you’re not going
to wreck it.

774
00:57:25.568 --> 00:57:26.652
Not this time.

775
00:57:28.654 --> 00:57:31.490
-Don’t you dare touch that.

776
00:57:42.168 --> 00:57:43.961
Come on. come on.
come on.

777
00:57:49.675 --> 00:57:50.885
She’s coming free.

778
00:58:01.437 --> 00:58:02.771
What the hell was that?

779
00:58:16.035 --> 00:58:17.661
Gurty? Gurty?

780
00:58:18.662 --> 00:58:19.663
Gurty!

781
00:58:21.123 --> 00:58:23.918
Gurty! Gurty!

782
00:59:36.365 --> 00:59:40.327
Gurty. stay with me.
Stay with me...

783
01:00:24.163 --> 01:00:26.498
Come on. Gurty.
Come on. Breathe.

784
01:00:26.582 --> 01:00:27.624
Breathe.

785
01:00:27.708 --> 01:00:30.252
Come on. Gurty.
Work with me here.

786
01:00:44.183 --> 01:00:45.684
-Oh. geez.

787
01:00:49.104 --> 01:00:50.189
Gurty.

788
01:00:52.691 --> 01:00:54.526
Gurty.

789
01:00:54.610 --> 01:00:58.155
Jesus. Here. pal. Here. pal.

790
01:00:58.238 --> 01:01:00.741
Here. pal. I got you.
I got you.

791
01:01:00.824 --> 01:01:02.701
-I got you.
-

792
01:01:02.785 --> 01:01:04.078
I got you.

793
01:01:06.413 --> 01:01:08.374
Gurty. I’m sorry.

794
01:01:08.457 --> 01:01:10.167
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.
I’m sorry I hit you.

795
01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:12.419
I’m sorry.
I didn’t mean to.

796
01:01:12.503 --> 01:01:14.338
I’m sorry. Gurty.

797
01:01:18.759 --> 01:01:19.968
Mike...

798
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:27.059
Yeah. Sunken dreams. Gurty.

799
01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:29.853
Sunken dreams.

800
01:01:30.854 --> 01:01:32.981
Yeah. It’s eating at me too.

801
01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:38.654
Why would an employee
of the company that hired us

802
01:01:38.737 --> 01:01:40.322
sabotage...?

803
01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:48.038
They want us to fail. That’s it.

804
01:01:48.122 --> 01:01:50.999
They want us to fail.
I didn’t see it.

805
01:01:51.083 --> 01:01:55.379
I’ve been too wrapped up
in what’s in this for us.

806
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:58.674
Oh. now I’m angry.

807
01:02:00.676 --> 01:02:02.177
Let’s get out of here.

808
01:02:03.595 --> 01:02:05.222
It’s not about money now.

809
01:02:06.056 --> 01:02:07.641
This is personal.

810
01:02:38.213 --> 01:02:40.757
Should be 20 minutes
to the shoreline.

811
01:03:07.534 --> 01:03:10.829
Rig two’s in the lake
20 klicks due south.

812
01:03:10.913 --> 01:03:12.873
Took the mechanic
and the driver with it.

813
01:03:12.956 --> 01:03:15.959
I told them not to store
dynamite in the trailer

814
01:03:16.043 --> 01:03:18.337
due to friction detonation.

815
01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:21.715
but they had other ideas.

816
01:03:21.798 --> 01:03:22.925
Good.

817
01:03:23.008 --> 01:03:24.384
Good. That’s good.

818
01:03:25.427 --> 01:03:26.512
How about the driver?

819
01:03:27.262 --> 01:03:29.765
Well. she’s alive. sir.

820
01:03:35.187 --> 01:03:38.190
Put the cab through
that guardrail up there.

821
01:03:39.149 --> 01:03:42.236
Your story is
she lost control.

822
01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:44.696
you dove for safety
before it went over.

823
01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:47.783
-You clear?
-Clear. sir.

824
01:03:47.866 --> 01:03:50.577
The miners’ oxygen window
closes in three hours.

825
01:03:50.661 --> 01:03:53.622
so the press is going to be
all over us.

826
01:03:53.705 --> 01:03:58.126
They need to be told our
valiant rescue had a tragic end.

827
01:03:58.210 --> 01:03:59.878
I’ll make it happen. sir.

828
01:03:59.962 --> 01:04:02.422
Good. Good.

829
01:04:02.506 --> 01:04:03.966
You call me
when it’s done.

830
01:04:27.489 --> 01:04:30.325
If you do this.
it’s on your head.

831
01:04:30.409 --> 01:04:32.119
You want to blame someone.
blame management.

832
01:04:32.202 --> 01:04:33.829
What has management
got to do with it?

833
01:04:35.038 --> 01:04:36.498
All those in favor.
raise your--

834
01:04:36.582 --> 01:04:38.000
Mankins!

835
01:04:38.083 --> 01:04:39.751
I asked you a question.

836
01:04:39.835 --> 01:04:41.962
Because they made us
cut the damn sensors. René.

837
01:04:43.005 --> 01:04:44.006
They what?

838
01:04:45.507 --> 01:04:47.426
They claimed the new quotas
were killing them.

839
01:04:47.509 --> 01:04:50.512
so they couldn’t afford
a shutdown.

840
01:04:50.596 --> 01:04:55.183
They said there was no chance
of gas pockets this far north.

841
01:04:55.267 --> 01:04:56.977
And they sweetened the deal.

842
01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:59.062
How much?

843
01:05:04.067 --> 01:05:06.278
Hundred dollars per man
per month.

844
01:05:08.572 --> 01:05:11.908
You turned off the gas sensors
for $100 a month?

845
01:05:11.992 --> 01:05:14.286
And anyone who blew the whistle
gets shit-canned.

846
01:05:14.369 --> 01:05:15.954
None of that
matters now. René.

847
01:05:16.038 --> 01:05:17.914
Our oxygen is falling fast.

848
01:05:17.998 --> 01:05:19.750
There’s a vote on the floor.

849
01:05:19.833 --> 01:05:21.543
All those in favor.
raise your hands.

850
01:05:21.627 --> 01:05:23.086
No.

851
01:05:25.505 --> 01:05:27.466
Hey!

852
01:05:27.549 --> 01:05:30.010
How much methane do you think
is in here now?

853
01:05:30.093 --> 01:05:31.303
Huh?

854
01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:33.889
These men are not
the enemy.

855
01:05:33.972 --> 01:05:35.474
The enemy’s up there.

856
01:05:35.557 --> 01:05:36.725
Bullshit!

857
01:05:36.808 --> 01:05:38.518
The enemy’s asphyxiation.

858
01:05:38.602 --> 01:05:40.687
We’re getting out of here
together.

859
01:05:40.771 --> 01:05:42.356
or not at all.

860
01:05:42.439 --> 01:05:45.192
You’re one stupid
son of a bitch. René.

861
01:05:47.778 --> 01:05:49.905
You too. Cody.

862
01:05:49.988 --> 01:05:53.825
Maybe so. but this is how
it’s going to be.

863
01:06:21.937 --> 01:06:23.355
Right here.

864
01:06:25.107 --> 01:06:26.233
Let’s clear the road.

865
01:06:58.598 --> 01:06:59.891
-Ow!
-

866
01:06:59.975 --> 01:07:01.727
Yeah. that’s what I thought.

867
01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:03.311
You’re never gonna
get away with this.

868
01:07:03.395 --> 01:07:04.980
There’s gonna be
an investigation.

869
01:07:05.063 --> 01:07:07.357
That’s the plan.

870
01:07:15.365 --> 01:07:16.742
What is that?

871
01:07:31.798 --> 01:07:33.175
-Ah!

872
01:08:07.793 --> 01:08:08.794
Thanks.

873
01:08:38.782 --> 01:08:40.242
Mayday! Mayday!

874
01:08:40.325 --> 01:08:42.452
Mayday! Come in!
Anybody. come in!

875
01:08:42.536 --> 01:08:43.745
Mayday! Mayday!

876
01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:46.248
Mayday! Is anybody out there?

877
01:08:46.331 --> 01:08:48.375
Tantoo. it’s Mike.

878
01:08:48.458 --> 01:08:50.043
We’re coming up the Pass.

879
01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:52.170
-Where are you?
-Approaching the upper traverse.

880
01:08:52.254 --> 01:08:54.798
I got Varnay behind me
with others. They’re all armed.

881
01:08:54.881 --> 01:08:57.676
We’ve got two hours to get to
Katka. I’m still pulling weight.

882
01:08:57.759 --> 01:09:00.679
-They’re trying to stop us.
-Yeah. we figured.

883
01:09:00.762 --> 01:09:03.265
Cody always said that they cut
corners with the methane regs.

884
01:09:03.348 --> 01:09:04.975
Those bastards.
they caused the cave-in.

885
01:09:05.058 --> 01:09:06.434
now they’re trying
to cover it up.

886
01:09:06.518 --> 01:09:07.978
Not going to happen.

887
01:09:08.061 --> 01:09:10.146
Just hang on. We’re coming.

888
01:09:23.368 --> 01:09:26.371
Take them out so it will
pass forensics.

889
01:09:26.454 --> 01:09:27.831
No bullet holes.

890
01:09:27.914 --> 01:09:30.333
Do not discharge
your weapons.

891
01:10:30.352 --> 01:10:31.937
-What?

892
01:10:38.151 --> 01:10:39.361
Shit.

893
01:10:39.444 --> 01:10:40.612
Oh. come on.
One more mile.

894
01:10:40.695 --> 01:10:42.322
We can do one more mile.
Come on.

895
01:10:45.033 --> 01:10:47.369
Yeah. we can do it.
Come on.

896
01:11:05.011 --> 01:11:06.012
Pull over!

897
01:11:08.014 --> 01:11:09.808
Pull over now!

898
01:11:09.891 --> 01:11:11.184
Pull over!

899
01:11:13.895 --> 01:11:16.982
If they were going to shoot us.
they would’ve done it by now.

900
01:11:17.065 --> 01:11:19.401
Yeah. Good. Come on.

901
01:11:21.194 --> 01:11:22.529
Ready. bro?

902
01:11:24.698 --> 01:11:26.908
Pull over now!

903
01:14:38.224 --> 01:14:40.685
Well. don’t just stand there.
Let’s go.

904
01:14:58.369 --> 01:15:00.455
Come on. come on.
don’t stop. don’t stop.

905
01:15:00.538 --> 01:15:01.831
Don’t you dare stop.
Come on.

906
01:15:07.462 --> 01:15:11.007
Don’t do this to me.
Don’t... Don’t do this.

907
01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:13.218
Come on. keep going.
Don’t stop. don’t stop!

908
01:15:13.301 --> 01:15:15.094
Come on. you piece of shit.
Let’s go.

909
01:15:15.178 --> 01:15:17.680
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it.
I didn’t mean it!

910
01:15:42.705 --> 01:15:45.166
Don’t think that I’m not going
to use this on you!

911
01:15:50.505 --> 01:15:51.839
What’s your game?

912
01:15:53.675 --> 01:15:56.010
Oh. what. are you just
going to stand there?

913
01:15:57.762 --> 01:15:59.013
Yeah.

914
01:15:59.097 --> 01:16:00.807
This is the last wellhead.

915
01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:02.392
What are you going to do?

916
01:16:02.475 --> 01:16:04.477
You going to push it
the rest of the way?

917
01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.896
Because if you’re going
to make it to Katka

918
01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:09.315
before your brother
stops breathing.

919
01:16:09.399 --> 01:16:12.235
that’s what you’re going
to have to do.

920
01:16:17.031 --> 01:16:19.284
The other drivers
are going to come.

921
01:16:20.159 --> 01:16:21.911
The other drivers are dead.

922
01:17:05.079 --> 01:17:07.206
He ripped out
my fuel equalizer.

923
01:17:07.290 --> 01:17:09.042
Gurty can fix that.

924
01:17:10.501 --> 01:17:12.253
We’ll change out
your fuel line

925
01:17:12.337 --> 01:17:15.131
and siphon enough juice
to get you down to Katka.

926
01:17:17.133 --> 01:17:18.259
Listen...

927
01:17:18.968 --> 01:17:20.178
we...

928
01:17:21.012 --> 01:17:22.722
we seriously misjudged you.

929
01:17:23.806 --> 01:17:24.932
Friends?

930
01:17:27.894 --> 01:17:28.895
Yeah.

931
01:18:39.924 --> 01:18:41.676
Hey. how long do you think
all this is going to take?

932
01:18:41.759 --> 01:18:43.594
A couple of minutes.
I know you’re anxious

933
01:18:43.678 --> 01:18:45.596
-about your brother.
-Yeah.

934
01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:47.014
Cody’s all I got. you know?

935
01:18:47.098 --> 01:18:48.891
It’s kind of like
you and yours.

936
01:18:48.975 --> 01:18:49.976
Yeah.

937
01:18:52.270 --> 01:18:55.106
Gurty’s like that commercial.

938
01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:57.984
Takes a lickin’
but keeps on tickin’.

939
01:19:51.787 --> 01:19:53.664
That last can should do it.

940
01:19:54.624 --> 01:19:57.168
He saved my life.
Give him a treat.

941
01:20:09.388 --> 01:20:12.308
We can’t stay here
and we can’t back up.

942
01:20:12.391 --> 01:20:13.935
We’ll have to outrun it.

943
01:20:14.018 --> 01:20:16.395
-You’re dreaming.
-You got a better idea?

944
01:21:34.015 --> 01:21:35.099
Oh!

945
01:21:36.809 --> 01:21:38.311
-Oh.
- Uncouple the trailer.

946
01:21:38.394 --> 01:21:39.729
We got a wellhead
to deliver.

947
01:21:50.072 --> 01:21:52.283
Oh. geez.

948
01:21:52.366 --> 01:21:54.535
It’s not as bad as it looks.

949
01:21:57.121 --> 01:21:59.040
It’s. uh...

950
01:21:59.123 --> 01:22:02.460
It looks pretty bad. kid.

951
01:22:02.543 --> 01:22:04.587
-Just be fast about it.
-Uh...

952
01:22:04.670 --> 01:22:06.255
Like pulling out
a wisdom tooth.

953
01:22:06.339 --> 01:22:07.882
A wisdom tooth? Do I--

954
01:22:07.965 --> 01:22:09.425
Do I look like a dentist?

955
01:22:09.508 --> 01:22:11.052
-Aah!

956
01:22:12.178 --> 01:22:13.721
Good girl. Good girl.

957
01:22:13.804 --> 01:22:16.057
-Breathe. Breathe.
-

958
01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:18.768
That’s it. Good girl.
Good girl.

959
01:22:18.851 --> 01:22:21.771
Gurty. come and help me!

960
01:22:21.854 --> 01:22:23.397
-Good girl.

961
01:22:23.481 --> 01:22:24.523
Good girl.

962
01:22:25.941 --> 01:22:26.984
Come on.

963
01:22:34.116 --> 01:22:36.077
Hang tight.

964
01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:39.205
Gurty and I are going to haul
your trailer off the cliff.

965
01:22:39.288 --> 01:22:42.625
hook up and head
to that mine.

966
01:22:42.708 --> 01:22:45.294
We still got 45 minutes.

967
01:22:45.378 --> 01:22:46.587
Yeah.

968
01:23:16.283 --> 01:23:19.995
Sir? Mine Safety down in
Winnipeg wants René’s laptops.

969
01:23:20.079 --> 01:23:22.373
Fred. Mine Safety
gets the laptops

970
01:23:22.456 --> 01:23:24.500
when I say they get the laptops.
all right?

971
01:23:24.583 --> 01:23:26.377
We got a goddamn CEO
to worry about.

972
01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:27.878
Yeah. well. you can
tell him yourself.

973
01:23:27.962 --> 01:23:29.463
He’ll be here in an hour.

974
01:23:31.507 --> 01:23:35.094
There is nothing
in those e-mails

975
01:23:35.177 --> 01:23:37.346
that implicates us.

976
01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:40.391
Everything was cash.
so there’s no paper trail.

977
01:23:40.474 --> 01:23:42.351
To the authorities.
this just looks like

978
01:23:42.435 --> 01:23:45.187
another tragic mining accident.

979
01:23:49.024 --> 01:23:52.278
Right in the morning.
we open Tunnel 6.

980
01:23:52.361 --> 01:23:53.946
We remove the bodies.

981
01:23:54.029 --> 01:23:57.199
We let the public hold
their ritual funerals.

982
01:23:57.283 --> 01:24:00.911
We weather the obligatory
"occupational hazard" debate.

983
01:24:02.163 --> 01:24:03.873
And we open back up.

984
01:24:04.874 --> 01:24:06.667
Business as usual.

985
01:24:12.131 --> 01:24:14.550
Come on. Varnay.
answer the goddamn phone.

986
01:25:04.934 --> 01:25:06.352
Look. Gurty. we did it.

987
01:25:06.435 --> 01:25:07.853
We did it!

988
01:25:25.454 --> 01:25:27.248
Mike. Mike.

989
01:27:16.523 --> 01:27:18.025
Give me that pistol!

990
01:27:19.693 --> 01:27:22.488
Gurty. you got to take
the wheel.

991
01:27:22.571 --> 01:27:24.239
Come on. You can do it.

992
01:27:33.958 --> 01:27:36.961
Do not stop until you reach
the mine. got it?

993
01:27:37.044 --> 01:27:38.420
Do not stop.

994
01:27:40.673 --> 01:27:43.008
Hey. Kill him.

995
01:27:43.092 --> 01:27:44.802
Not for me.
for my brother.

996
01:29:51.095 --> 01:29:53.097
I’ve done this
a thousand times.

997
01:29:53.931 --> 01:29:56.058
Move. I can do it.

998
01:30:40.936 --> 01:30:42.146
Shit.

999
01:30:44.982 --> 01:30:46.900
Traction pads. Yes. go.

1000
01:31:07.129 --> 01:31:08.839
Go! Come on. come on.

1001
01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:13.594
Shit. Shit.

1002
01:31:19.933 --> 01:31:22.853
Gurty. the cables are snapping!
Let’s go! Come on!

1003
01:33:14.756 --> 01:33:16.133
Come on.

1004
01:33:33.608 --> 01:33:35.610
Oh. shit. Oh. shit.

1005
01:33:49.207 --> 01:33:51.043
Gurty. shut the gate!

1006
01:34:18.612 --> 01:34:20.906
-Gurty!
-

1007
01:34:55.857 --> 01:34:58.193
Gurty. Gurty!

1008
01:35:01.655 --> 01:35:02.948
He saved the rig.

1009
01:35:03.031 --> 01:35:04.449
Oh. Jesus.

1010
01:35:04.533 --> 01:35:05.826
Mike...

1011
01:35:05.909 --> 01:35:07.119
you...

1012
01:35:07.202 --> 01:35:09.287
brother mine.

1013
01:35:09.371 --> 01:35:12.290
My brother.

1014
01:35:17.963 --> 01:35:20.173
Brother. Mine.

1015
01:35:33.478 --> 01:35:35.564
No. no. no. no...

1016
01:35:38.316 --> 01:35:39.609
No.

1017
01:35:41.611 --> 01:35:43.530
I’m sorry.

1018
01:35:43.613 --> 01:35:46.950
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

1019
01:35:47.033 --> 01:35:48.994
I’m so sorry.

1020
01:35:56.835 --> 01:35:59.463
Deputy Minister. Jack Tager.
vice president of operations.

1021
01:35:59.546 --> 01:36:01.006
George Sickle.
general manager.

1022
01:36:01.089 --> 01:36:02.215
-Tager.
-Sir.

1023
01:36:02.299 --> 01:36:03.633
-Sickle.
-How are you. sir?

1024
01:36:03.717 --> 01:36:05.135
It’s cold up here.

1025
01:36:05.218 --> 01:36:06.761
We have hot drink
and food inside. sir.

1026
01:36:06.845 --> 01:36:09.264
How was the drive
down from Gillam Airfield?

1027
01:36:09.347 --> 01:36:12.267
Cut the formalities. Sickle.
Tell me the situation.

1028
01:36:13.477 --> 01:36:18.523
Our last contact
with the rescue team was 0300.

1029
01:36:18.607 --> 01:36:20.859
Deputy Minister.
how about you?

1030
01:36:20.942 --> 01:36:22.694
Your man in Winnipeg.
Heard anything?

1031
01:36:22.777 --> 01:36:24.154
Negative.

1032
01:36:24.237 --> 01:36:25.780
It’s been 30 hours

1033
01:36:25.864 --> 01:36:27.574
and the wellheads
haven’t arrived.

1034
01:36:27.657 --> 01:36:28.992
I don’t believe
the men are going

1035
01:36:29.075 --> 01:36:30.535
to get out
of Tunnel 6 alive.

1036
01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:50.263
What’s that?

1037
01:36:50.347 --> 01:36:52.265
That’s our emergency Klaxon.

1038
01:37:02.150 --> 01:37:03.985
Oh. my God.

1039
01:37:07.113 --> 01:37:10.075
Hey. welcome to Katka.

1040
01:37:10.158 --> 01:37:11.159
You McCann?

1041
01:37:11.243 --> 01:37:12.869
Yeah.

1042
01:37:12.953 --> 01:37:13.995
You need medical?

1043
01:37:21.253 --> 01:37:23.880
Everyone. on the double.
We still have a chance.

1044
01:37:25.298 --> 01:37:27.717
We got another one.
Get me the gurney. ASAP.

1045
01:37:28.843 --> 01:37:30.929
There’s no hurry.

1046
01:37:31.012 --> 01:37:32.305
We need to get that wellhead

1047
01:37:32.389 --> 01:37:33.848
unloaded and bolted down.

1048
01:37:33.932 --> 01:37:35.392
Let’s go!
Straight to the drill site.

1049
01:37:35.475 --> 01:37:36.643
Go. go. go. go!

1050
01:37:49.698 --> 01:37:51.032
Wellhead team. let’s go!
You’re up!

1051
01:38:17.058 --> 01:38:19.019
Got it!

1052
01:38:19.102 --> 01:38:21.563
Wellhead is tapped
and sprung.

1053
01:38:21.646 --> 01:38:24.274
All right. blasting team.
Tunnel 6 on the double!

1054
01:38:40.624 --> 01:38:42.334
Young lady.
you’re in no condition--

1055
01:38:42.417 --> 01:38:44.085
I don’t give a shit.
Put a Band-Aid on it.

1056
01:38:44.169 --> 01:38:45.795
I heard blasting.
I’m going to find Cody.

1057
01:38:45.879 --> 01:38:47.297
-Tantoo.
-What?

1058
01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:49.424
We’re outside
the oxygen window.

1059
01:38:49.507 --> 01:38:50.925
We didn’t make it
in time.

1060
01:38:51.009 --> 01:38:53.428
Don’t say that.

1061
01:38:53.511 --> 01:38:55.805
Look. Gurty died so that
the miners would live. okay?

1062
01:38:55.889 --> 01:38:58.683
My brother is alive.
I’m going to find him. Let’s go.

1063
01:39:09.986 --> 01:39:11.655
Someone’s coming out!

1064
01:39:36.513 --> 01:39:37.972
Cody?

1065
01:39:46.981 --> 01:39:47.982
Cody?

1066
01:39:48.733 --> 01:39:50.276
Oh. my God!

1067
01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:52.904
Cody. You’re alive.

1068
01:39:52.987 --> 01:39:55.407
-Oh. my God.
- You saved my life.

1069
01:39:58.410 --> 01:40:00.036
I had help.

1070
01:40:01.705 --> 01:40:02.706
Thank you.

1071
01:40:23.393 --> 01:40:24.644
You paid them?

1072
01:40:27.063 --> 01:40:30.275
You paid them to shut off
their sensors?

1073
01:40:36.448 --> 01:40:38.032
You’re disgusting.

1074
01:41:02.432 --> 01:41:04.184
Mr. McCann?

1075
01:41:04.267 --> 01:41:07.187
I’m Deputy Minister
of Natural Resources for Canada.

1076
01:41:07.270 --> 01:41:08.688
I want to thank you.

1077
01:41:08.772 --> 01:41:11.357
and offer condolences
for your brother.

1078
01:41:11.441 --> 01:41:13.485
The company has some papers
for you to sign.

1079
01:41:13.568 --> 01:41:14.944
We have a check for you.

1080
01:41:15.028 --> 01:41:16.988
and the police
need your statement.

1081
01:41:21.618 --> 01:41:23.870
Excuse me. Mr. McCann?

1082
01:41:23.953 --> 01:41:26.289
We found this
with your brother’s things.

1083
01:41:38.510 --> 01:41:39.803
Thank you.

1084
01:42:14.671 --> 01:42:16.422
-Hey!

Yup.

1087
01:42:21.386 --> 01:42:22.470
It’s a good color.

1088
01:42:22.554 --> 01:42:24.389
In honor of Jim.

1089
01:42:24.472 --> 01:42:26.099

1090
01:42:26.182 --> 01:42:27.225
Sporting goods.

1091
01:42:27.308 --> 01:42:29.269
Oh. Ain’t that the life.

1092
01:42:29.352 --> 01:42:32.730
Yup. No bosses.
no punching time clocks.

1093
01:42:32.814 --> 01:42:34.399
-Good pay rates.
-Yeah.

1094
01:42:34.482 --> 01:42:37.277
Well. you find yourself
pining for the ice road.

1095
01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:38.611

1096
01:42:38.695 --> 01:42:40.029
Deal.

1097
01:42:43.658 --> 01:42:44.701
Thank you. Mike.

1098
01:44:02.946 --> 01:44:05.657
And a blacktop

1099
01:44:14.958 --> 01:44:18.169
We got tough

1100
01:44:18.252 --> 01:44:22.090
Running through our veins

1101
01:44:22.173 --> 01:44:24.842
We’ll find a way

1102
01:44:24.926 --> 01:44:27.929
Never say die

1103
01:44:28.012 --> 01:44:31.766
You’re doggone right

1104
01:44:31.849 --> 01:44:37.188
We’ll come back every time

1105
01:45:05.633 --> 01:45:10.930
To our last names

1106
01:45:14.183 --> 01:45:17.353
We got tough

1107
01:45:17.437 --> 01:45:21.441
Running through our veins

1108
01:45:21.524 --> 01:45:24.277
We’ll find a way

1109
01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:27.071
Never say die
