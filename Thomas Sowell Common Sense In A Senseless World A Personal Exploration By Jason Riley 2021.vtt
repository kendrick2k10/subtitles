00:00:02.903 --> 00:00:04.471
This whole notion
that the black family

3
00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:07.207
has always been disintegrating.
that is nonsense.

00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:08.942

The great bulk
of black families were intact

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:13.513
two-parent families
up through 1925

8
00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:16.016
and going all the way back
through the era of slavery.

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:18.285
So it is now only
within our own time

10
00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:21.221
that we suddenly see
this inevitable tragedy

11
00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:24.124
which the welfare system says
it's going to rush in to solve.

It's been 40 years

or so many other subjects.
his scholarship

16
00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.204
remains as relevant as ever.

17
00:00:37.204 --> 00:00:39.273
Racists may prefer
one race to another.

18
00:00:39.273 --> 00:00:41.508
but they prefer themselves
to everybody else.

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:43.911
Thomas Sowell
is a trained economist.

20
00:00:43.911 --> 00:00:46.346
He's a sociologist
who has written books

21
00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:48.615
about virtually every culture
that's ever existed.

22
00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:50.217
He is a photographer.

23
00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:54.721
He is America's greatest
contemporary living philosopher.

I'm a journalist and author.

26
00:00:58.025 --> 00:00:59.493
For more than two decades.

27
00:00:59.493 --> 00:01:03.163
I have closely studied the life
and work of Thomas Sowell.

28
00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:07.501
His story is both
fascinating and illuminating.

29
00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:10.470
Tom makes a very. very good
point that general principles

30
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.107
affect everybody. whether
they're black. brown. or purple.

31
00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:18.245
Tom is fearless not just
in advancing unpopular opinions.

32
00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:21.148
but in venturing into
areas of scholarship

33
00:01:21.148 --> 00:01:23.317
that had been untrodden.

34
00:01:23.317 --> 00:01:25.218
Tom Sowell
is known for his views

35
00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:29.122
on economics. history. race.
and politics.

36
00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:31.024
But I've also discovered
some lesser-known

37
00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:33.460
aspects of his life --

38
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.730
his research and his writings
about late-talking children.

39
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.532
and the fact that he is
a highly regarded

40
00:01:38.532 --> 00:01:41.702
world-traveling
photographer.

41
00:01:41.702 --> 00:01:45.205
Over the next hour. we'll
examine the life and career

42
00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:47.074
of Dr. Thomas Sowell.

43
00:01:47.074 --> 00:01:49.142
how he rose from
humble beginnings

44
00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:51.044
to attend and teach
at some of the nation's

45
00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:52.879
leading institutions

46
00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:55.916
and became one of our
foremost social commentators.

47
00:01:55.916 --> 00:01:59.019
You were a Marxist
at one time in your life.

48
00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:00.821
What was your wake-up
to what was wrong

49
00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:02.055
with that line of thinking?

50
00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:03.290
Uh. facts.

51
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.425
You're about to meet
one of the greatest minds

52
00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:07.260
of the past half-century.

Funding for this program

55
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.442
has been provided by...

[ music ]

57
00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:39.926
Because I was a Marxist
at the time.

58
00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:41.995
and they were appalled.
and I thought --

59
00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:44.431
you know. they have very
high intellectual standards.

60
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:49.302
and I'm not going to find
ideological soul mates.

61
00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:51.705
I was still a Marxist.

62
00:02:51.705 --> 00:02:53.440
I took a summer job
in the government.

63
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.510
got an intern in economics.

64
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.945
And it was seeing
the government from the inside

65
00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:01.081
that turned me around.

66
00:03:01.081 --> 00:03:02.482
The vision of the left.

67
00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:04.251
and I think many conservatives
underestimate this.

68
00:03:04.251 --> 00:03:08.288
is really a more attractive
vision in itself.

69
00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:10.490
The only reason
for not believing in it

70
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.459
is that it doesn't work.

71
00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.895
But you don't see that
at the outset

72
00:03:14.895 --> 00:03:17.397
if all you're looking at
is just a theory.

73
00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:19.966
If the world were the way
the left conceives it to be.

74
00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:21.368
it would be a better world

75
00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:23.336
than the way the right
conceives it to be.

76
00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:26.073
It just happens
that the world is not that way.

77
00:03:26.073 --> 00:03:27.808
For me. Thomas Sowell

78
00:03:27.808 --> 00:03:29.609
is that rarest of species --

79
00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.611
and honest intellectual.

80
00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:32.946
He's spent a career

81
00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:36.016
putting truth above popularity.

82
00:03:36.016 --> 00:03:38.018
He's explored the answers
to questions

83
00:03:38.018 --> 00:03:40.754
others were afraid to even ask.

84
00:03:40.754 --> 00:03:43.256
He's followed the facts
where they lead

85
00:03:43.256 --> 00:03:45.025
and accepted the findings.

86
00:03:45.025 --> 00:03:48.161
however unpopular
or politically incorrect.

87
00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:50.263
Thomas Sowell
fervently stands

88
00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:53.100
by his well-researched beliefs.

89
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.402
and he does not hesitate
to let someone know

90
00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:58.705
if he thinks they're wrong.

91
00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:01.308
I've spent dozens of hours
interviewing Tom

92
00:04:01.308 --> 00:04:03.677
and hundreds more
selecting stories

93
00:04:03.677 --> 00:04:06.279
he's told over the years
to others

94
00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:10.016
to help us understand
what makes Thomas Sowell unique.

[ music ]

96
00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:16.823
Sowell's body of work
is quite vast.

97
00:04:16.823 --> 00:04:19.593
It's covered everything
from economics and history

98
00:04:19.593 --> 00:04:22.262
to culture. migration.
and racial inequality.

99
00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:25.499
The main thing that
he's done. in my opinion.

100
00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:27.434
is to cause people to rethink
their assumptions

101
00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:29.569
about all sorts of things.

102
00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:30.971
Not just economics.

103
00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:33.573
but about race. about politics.

104
00:04:33.573 --> 00:04:36.676
about how we get along.

105
00:04:36.676 --> 00:04:38.512
Tom is absolutely fearless.

106
00:04:38.512 --> 00:04:40.413
I mean. he's forceful
in his opinions.

107
00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:43.116
He will not compromise
any of his opinions

108
00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:47.020
for the sake
of social politeness.

109
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.956
How do you take
the measure of a man.

110
00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:52.692
especially if he's someone
who's impacted our thinking

111
00:04:52.692 --> 00:04:57.164
about politics and economics
for more than half a century?

112
00:04:57.164 --> 00:05:01.334
Do you do it through his deeds
or influence?

113
00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:05.105
Or by what he says or writes?

114
00:05:05.105 --> 00:05:07.274
Perhaps
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

115
00:05:07.274 --> 00:05:08.542
said it best --

116
00:05:08.542 --> 00:05:10.677
"The ultimate
measure of a man

117
00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:11.912
is not where he stands

118
00:05:11.912 --> 00:05:15.582
in moments of comfort
and convenience.

119
00:05:15.582 --> 00:05:20.187
but where he stands at times
of challenge and controversy."

120
00:05:20.187 --> 00:05:23.423
The media -- the television
and the print media.

121
00:05:23.423 --> 00:05:24.858
they've wised up.

122
00:05:24.858 --> 00:05:26.560
You can't argue with Tom.

123
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.729
so you might as well hide
what he's doing.

124
00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:31.431
And that's what they're doing.

125
00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:34.000
They're just ignoring
what he's written

126
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.704
because there's no way that
they can argue with Tom Sowell.

[ music ]

128
00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:44.511
What distinguishes
Thomas Sowell's scholarship?

129
00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:47.447
First. intellectual honesty --
asking the right questions.

130
00:05:47.447 --> 00:05:49.015
gathering the relevant data.

131
00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:51.851
and following the facts
to their logical conclusion.

132
00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:55.655
even if that conclusion
turns out to be unpopular.

133
00:05:55.655 --> 00:05:58.391
Second. the importance
of incentives

134
00:05:58.391 --> 00:05:59.893
and the reality of trade-offs

135
00:05:59.893 --> 00:06:02.462
in addressing
our social problems.

136
00:06:02.462 --> 00:06:04.931
Third. the belief
that a group's upward mobility

137
00:06:04.931 --> 00:06:09.169
derives primarily from its
development of human capital.

138
00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:11.972
And finally. Sowell has
an abiding respect

139
00:06:11.972 --> 00:06:15.542
for social processes
and existing institutions

140
00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:18.311
and the role they play
in decision-making.

So where do Tom Sowell's
ideas come from?

142
00:06:20.614 --> 00:06:23.450
What formed the foundation
of a man who would go on

143
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.920
to become one of the country's
foremost public intellectuals?

144
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.355
That story began

00:06:28.355 --> 00:06:30.690
600 miles to the south
of Midtown Manhattan

146
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.525

Thomas Sowell was born
in Gastonia. North Carolina.

on June 30. 1930.

150
00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:50.477
The Great Depression
was just getting underway.

151
00:06:50.477 --> 00:06:53.246
and like many blacks
in the South at the time.

152
00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:56.716
his family had no electricity.

00:06:56.716 --> 00:06:58.652
no central heating.

00:06:58.652 --> 00:07:01.921
and no hot running water.

155
00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:04.658
Sowell's father died
before Tom was born

156

and his mother. a maid.
died in childbirth

157
00:07:09.562 --> 00:07:11.464
just a few years later.

158
00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:15.135
He was adopted by
his great aunt

159
00:07:15.135 --> 00:07:18.872
and raised by her
and her two daughters.

160
00:07:18.872 --> 00:07:21.074
So he was raised by three women.

161
00:07:21.074 --> 00:07:23.877
My whole career
would not have been possible

162
00:07:23.877 --> 00:07:26.379
without the particular family
in which I was raised.

163
00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:28.982
which was not composed
of educated people.

164
00:07:28.982 --> 00:07:31.284
I mean. nobody in that family
had ever graduated

165
00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:32.686
from high school.

166
00:07:32.686 --> 00:07:35.322
and most had not graduated
from grade school.

167
00:07:35.322 --> 00:07:37.057
But they were interested
in education

168
00:07:37.057 --> 00:07:38.925
and they were interested in me.

169
00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:46.032
Tom was raised by a great aunt
and her adult children.

170
00:07:46.032 --> 00:07:47.667
The family moved
to New York City's

171
00:07:47.667 --> 00:07:49.869
Harlem neighborhood.

172
00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:52.839
a migration that exposed him
to better schools

173
00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:55.342
and more opportunities than were
available to blacks

174
00:07:55.342 --> 00:07:56.910
in the segregated South.

175
00:07:59.045 --> 00:08:01.514
"My great fear is that
a black child

176
00:08:01.514 --> 00:08:04.417
growing up in Harlem today
will not have as good a chance

177
00:08:04.417 --> 00:08:06.986
to rise as people
of my generation did.

178
00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:08.922

was that

at the University of Chicago.

531
00:23:58.304 --> 00:24:01.040
economics was
a full-contact sport

where you had to defend your
position rigorously.

otherwise you got wasted.

534
00:24:05.878 --> 00:24:08.347
And so at least Tom Sowell
said he came out understanding

00:24:08.347 --> 00:24:10.249
the importance of hard data.

536
00:24:10.249 --> 00:24:14.687
I was still a Marxist after
taking Milton Friedman's course.

But one summer
in the government

00:24:18.157 --> 00:24:19.591
was enough to let me say.

00:24:19.591 --> 00:24:22.127

The federal government did.

My first professional job.

00:24:35.407 --> 00:24:39.611
I was a summer intern
at the U.S. Department of Labor.

549
00:24:39.611 --> 00:24:41.947
One of my biggest concerns
was about minimum wages.

550
00:24:41.947 --> 00:24:43.449
At first. I thought.
well. this is good

551
00:24:43.449 --> 00:24:44.717
because all these
people are poor

552
00:24:44.717 --> 00:24:46.819
and they'll get
a little higher income.

553
00:24:46.819 --> 00:24:48.954
and so that'll be helpful.

554
00:24:48.954 --> 00:24:51.357
And then as I studied economics.

555
00:24:51.357 --> 00:24:52.891
I began to see.
well. there's a downside.

556
00:24:52.891 --> 00:24:54.393
They may lose
their jobs completely.

557
00:24:54.393 --> 00:24:57.129
So that is that.

558
00:24:57.129 --> 00:24:58.697
When I was at
the Labor Department.

559
00:24:58.697 --> 00:25:00.866
I tried to talk about
that to them

560
00:25:00.866 --> 00:25:03.702

with some test of it.

with how we might test this.

the U.S. Department of Labor

568
00:25:18.517 --> 00:25:21.186
had its own agenda
and interests.

569
00:25:21.186 --> 00:25:23.155
and that did not
necessarily mean

570
00:25:23.155 --> 00:25:25.624
that whether poor people lost
their jobs for minimum wage

571
00:25:25.624 --> 00:25:28.494
or got higher pay
was their highest priority.

Tom Sowell looked at the data.

574
00:25:32.898 --> 00:25:36.969
minimum wage hikes cause people
who are unskilled to lose jobs.

575
00:25:36.969 --> 00:25:38.504
He found out that people
in the government

576
00:25:38.504 --> 00:25:40.739
didn't give a rip whether or not
it worked or didn't work.

They were simply implementing
the policy.

578

And that's what shocked him
and caused him

579
00:25:44.943 --> 00:25:46.612
to begin to rethink
lots of his assumptions.

580
00:25:46.612 --> 00:25:48.614
So it wasn't academia
that caused him

to become more conservative.

In 1965. Thomas Sowell took
a teaching position at Cornell.

Like many other colleges.
it became a focal point

When armed black students
took over a building on campus.

Sowell had little sympathy
for school administrators.

600
00:26:47.239 --> 00:26:50.309
Blacks had been recruited
to Cornell under lower standards

601
00:26:50.309 --> 00:26:54.079
to diversify the student body.
and Sowell observed

602
00:26:54.079 --> 00:26:56.949
that many of these same students
were now causing trouble

603
00:26:56.949 --> 00:26:59.117
and feeding
racial divisions.

604
00:26:59.117 --> 00:27:02.654
For Sowell. it was an example
of the unintended consequences

particularly surrounding
the campus protests.

00:27:12.498 --> 00:27:17.236

their SAT scores
were above the average

but they are having
problems at Cornell.

614
00:27:29.314 --> 00:27:31.950

came up with the idea

00:27:33.919 --> 00:27:37.823

in over their heads.

And we started talk from there.

666

and that is share his knowledge
of economics

The true test of whether
someone understands

669
00:30:12.811 --> 00:30:16.281
a subject -- the true test comes
when he can explain it

670
00:30:16.281 --> 00:30:19.818
to someone who does not know
a darn thing about it.

671
00:30:19.818 --> 00:30:23.221
And Tom has the gift
of being able to do that.

where the policies that
are being advocated for blacks

any people out of poverty.

for blacks in the United States.

remained in poverty

trying to follow those patterns.

the constitutional guarantees
as everybody else.

685
00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:04.396
Now we do. but because
the civil rights struggle

686
00:31:04.396 --> 00:31:07.866
is over and won. and we're
not facing the kind of

687
00:31:07.866 --> 00:31:10.235
gross racial discrimination
of the past

688
00:31:10.235 --> 00:31:13.305
does not mean that
there are not major problems.

689
00:31:13.305 --> 00:31:15.173
I'm fairly sure
that Tom would say

690
00:31:15.173 --> 00:31:18.310
that the 75% rate

691
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:23.415
of illegitimacy among blacks
is a devastating problem.

692
00:31:23.415 --> 00:31:25.016
but it's not a racial problem.

693
00:31:25.016 --> 00:31:27.252
It's not a legacy
of slavery.

694
00:31:27.252 --> 00:31:30.756
The crime that -- I believe
Tom would say as well --

695
00:31:30.756 --> 00:31:33.125
that the crime we see
in many black communities

696
00:31:33.125 --> 00:31:35.060
is a devastating problem.

697
00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:37.963
but it has nothing to do
with racial discrimination.

and cultures can be explained
ultimately by their geography.

874
00:39:11.583 --> 00:39:13.918
Too often the influence
of geography on wealth

875
00:39:13.918 --> 00:39:17.689
is thought of narrowly.
in terms of natural resources

876
00:39:17.689 --> 00:39:19.591
that translate directly
into wealth.

877
00:39:19.591 --> 00:39:23.194
such as oil in the Middle East
or gold in South Africa.

878
00:39:23.194 --> 00:39:25.330
But important
as such differences are.

879
00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:26.698
geography influences

880
00:39:26.698 --> 00:39:29.133
even more profound
cultural differences

881
00:39:29.133 --> 00:39:31.936
among the peoples themselves.

882
00:39:31.936 --> 00:39:35.640
Why did Europe conquer Africa
instead of vice versa?

883
00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:39.477
Well. there are a number
of ways in which civilizations

884
00:39:39.477 --> 00:39:43.248
become complex. primarily
through the aggregation

885
00:39:43.248 --> 00:39:46.618
and exchange of ideas.

886
00:39:46.618 --> 00:39:48.553
Sophisticated cultures
are ones that sit

887
00:39:48.553 --> 00:39:50.121
in the middle
of a catchment area

888
00:39:50.121 --> 00:39:53.858
where innovations from
other cultures can be aggregated

889
00:39:53.858 --> 00:39:55.893
and kind of greatest hits
collections.

890
00:39:55.893 --> 00:39:58.596
and so geography
that allows movement of people

891
00:39:58.596 --> 00:40:01.532
and ideas with rivers.

892
00:40:01.532 --> 00:40:05.436
with highways. intersections
of highways. port cities

893
00:40:05.436 --> 00:40:09.507
tend to become more
culturally sophisticated.

894
00:40:09.507 --> 00:40:11.075
A lot of his research.
as you mentioned.

895
00:40:11.075 --> 00:40:14.045
has focused on why
some groups excel

896
00:40:14.045 --> 00:40:15.813
and others do not.

897
00:40:15.813 --> 00:40:19.717
But that curiosity
is not necessarily appreciated

898
00:40:19.717 --> 00:40:21.919
by a lot of people

899
00:40:21.919 --> 00:40:26.457
who seem to to approach it
from the standpoint

900
00:40:26.457 --> 00:40:29.394
that if a culture isn't rising.

901
00:40:29.394 --> 00:40:30.762
it's someone else's fault.

902
00:40:30.762 --> 00:40:31.362
Yes.

903
00:40:31.362 --> 00:40:34.599
Someone else is keeping them
down. or. you know.

904
00:40:34.599 --> 00:40:38.369
if America is up here. it is
at the expense of this group

905
00:40:38.369 --> 00:40:40.605
or this country
or this region.

906
00:40:40.605 --> 00:40:42.907
He doesn't take that approach.

907
00:40:42.907 --> 00:40:46.477
What Tom did when he talked
about comparative cultures.

908
00:40:46.477 --> 00:40:51.449
he went to this quite narrow
and unheralded group of scholars

909
00:40:51.449 --> 00:40:53.384
that talked about economics.

910
00:40:53.384 --> 00:40:55.053
and then he took that data.

911
00:40:55.053 --> 00:40:58.122
superimposed it onto
history questions.

912
00:40:58.122 --> 00:41:00.325
So when people who were
critical of Tom would say.

913
00:41:00.325 --> 00:41:03.027
"Well. he hasn't read this
particular historical work."

914
00:41:03.027 --> 00:41:07.265
or. "He wasn't quite
appreciative of this great novel

915
00:41:07.265 --> 00:41:09.067
or this great history
or this."

916
00:41:09.067 --> 00:41:11.235
They didn't understand
that what he lost

917
00:41:11.235 --> 00:41:13.905
as being an economic historian.

918
00:41:13.905 --> 00:41:16.841
he gained in really
trying to explain

919
00:41:16.841 --> 00:41:19.110
how cultures were successful

920
00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:21.479
or how much dominance
they had in trade

921
00:41:21.479 --> 00:41:22.980
by actually looking
at economics.

922
00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:24.215
And most historians. you know.

923
00:41:24.215 --> 00:41:26.784
they think that economics
is a dismal science.

924
00:41:26.784 --> 00:41:29.420
and they're not
trained to do that.

925
00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:32.557
"The first lesson
of economics is scarcity:

926
00:41:32.557 --> 00:41:35.393
there is never enough
of anything to fully satisfy

927
00:41:35.393 --> 00:41:38.296
all those who want it.

928
00:41:38.296 --> 00:41:40.465
The first lesson of politics

929
00:41:40.465 --> 00:41:43.701
is to disregard
the first lesson of economics."

00:41:43.701 --> 00:41:50.274
[ music ]

931
00:41:50.274 --> 00:41:54.445
I wanted to explore how
Sowell’s concepts on free markets have

932
00:41:54.445 --> 00:41:57.315
influenced business leaders today.

933
00:41:57.315 --> 00:42:02.754
A perfect example can be found in Salt
Lake City. Utah. at Overstock.com.

934
00:42:02.754 --> 00:42:10.962
One of the most successful
online retailers in the world.

935
00:42:10.962 --> 00:42:15.767
Aaron Hunsaker. an Overstock
employee. has been heavily influenced

936
00:42:15.767 --> 00:42:18.503
by Thomas Sowell’s ideas.

937
00:42:18.503 --> 00:42:24.142
He credits much it’s success to
the free-market economic principles

938
00:42:24.142 --> 00:42:26.411
championed by Thomas Sowell.

939
00:42:26.411 --> 00:42:32.049
I discovered Thomas Sowell like every
good thinker discovers things in the

940
00:42:32.049 --> 00:42:36.921
modern-day. on YouTube.

941
00:42:36.921 --> 00:42:40.792
I was watching a Milton Friedman
video. and I see Thomas Sowell

942
00:42:40.792 --> 00:42:45.797
speaking with Milton Friedman.
and I was like. wow. this guy

943
00:42:45.797 --> 00:42:47.265
is really. really smart.

944
00:42:47.265 --> 00:42:54.305
And he gave a real rigorous. as
rigorous as you could be on TV. but a

945
00:42:54.305 --> 00:42:57.809
real rigorous answer to a question.
and I really appreciated that.

946
00:42:57.809 --> 00:43:01.279
And I just kind of went down the
YouTube wormhole with Thomas Sowell.

947
00:43:01.279 --> 00:43:05.750
and then I saw that he’d written like.
you know. ten or a thousand books or

948
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:08.052
something like that.
he has tons of books.

949
00:43:08.052 --> 00:43:14.892
And I just started to explore him. and
the more I explored Thomas Sowell. he

950
00:43:14.892 --> 00:43:22.200
talked a lot about incentives in
institutions. government institutions.

951
00:43:27.071 --> 00:43:30.475
I come from kind of a punk rock
hardcore background. and I had an

952
00:43:30.475 --> 00:43:37.815
incentive to be more left and
angry because it makes better music.

953
00:43:37.815 --> 00:43:41.385
You don't hear a whole lot of music
about. oh. well. if I work really

954
00:43:41.385 --> 00:43:44.755
hard. and we base it off
meritocracy. things will be great.

955
00:43:44.755 --> 00:43:52.830
But upon kind of digging into Thomas
Sowell’s thought process. I realized

956
00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:58.936
that it is far more punk rock to
base things off of individual

957
00:43:58.936 --> 00:44:00.171
freedoms and thought.

958
00:44:00.171 --> 00:44:05.510
I see him as someone who has
constantly strived to be consistent.

959
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:10.681
And to those that want to be
consistent. you have to study

960
00:44:10.681 --> 00:44:13.918
geography; you have to study
history; you have to study political

961
00:44:13.918 --> 00:44:18.956
philosophy; you have to study
journalism; you have to study all of

962
00:44:18.956 --> 00:44:26.197
these subjects as a whole and see how
you can put together a view that makes

963
00:44:26.197 --> 00:44:28.900
them consistent with each other.

964
00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:32.703
That’s why I think Thomas Sowell
is so well-versed and such

965
00:44:32.703 --> 00:44:35.039
a Renaissance man.

966
00:44:37.008 --> 00:44:39.610
I grew up in an era when
people. particularly blacks.

967
00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:41.579
were a lot poorer than today.

968
00:44:41.579 --> 00:44:44.181
faced a lot
more discrimination than today.

969
00:44:44.181 --> 00:44:45.917
and in which the teenage
pregnancy rate

970
00:44:45.917 --> 00:44:48.219
was a lot lower than today.

971
00:44:48.219 --> 00:44:50.288
I don't believe there is
a predestined amount

972
00:44:50.288 --> 00:44:51.689
of teenage pregnancy.

973
00:44:51.689 --> 00:44:53.958
a predestined amount
of husband desertion.

974
00:44:53.958 --> 00:44:55.726
Gutman has done a study
of the black family

975
00:44:55.726 --> 00:44:57.895
showing that this whole notion
that the black family

976
00:44:57.895 --> 00:45:01.098
has always been disintegrating.
that is nonsense.

977
00:45:01.098 --> 00:45:02.700
"Some things are believed

978
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:05.336
because they are
demonstrably true.

979
00:45:05.336 --> 00:45:07.405
but many other things
are believed

980
00:45:07.405 --> 00:45:10.441
simply because they have been
asserted repeatedly."

[ music ]

982
00:45:11.943 --> 00:45:15.780
In the 1990s. Sowell took up
a new area of research

983
00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:18.683
the phenomenon
of late-talking children.

984
00:45:18.683 --> 00:45:21.319
For Tom. it was personal.

985
00:45:21.319 --> 00:45:23.955
I met Tom Sowell
through language.

986
00:45:23.955 --> 00:45:26.691
I am a cognitive scientist.
I study language.

987
00:45:26.691 --> 00:45:28.259
I wrote a book on language.

988
00:45:28.259 --> 00:45:31.495
and I got a letter out of the
blue from Professor Sowell.

989
00:45:31.495 --> 00:45:32.964
His son was a late talker.

990
00:45:32.964 --> 00:45:36.000
but contrary
to some of the diagnosis

991
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.502
that he got
from so-called experts.

992
00:45:38.502 --> 00:45:42.440
he didn't believe that his son
was retarded or autistic.

993
00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:44.809
just that his language
was late in developing.

994
00:45:44.809 --> 00:45:46.744
He just did not talk.

995
00:45:46.744 --> 00:45:49.080
This meshed
with my own understanding

996
00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:50.748
of the relationship
between language and thought.

997
00:45:50.748 --> 00:45:53.651
namely
they're not the same thing.

998
00:45:53.651 --> 00:45:57.488
So I wrote to Tom saying.
"Your intuition about your son

999
00:45:57.488 --> 00:46:00.424
is consistent
with my understanding."

1000
00:46:00.424 --> 00:46:02.927
Tom Sowell sought out answers.

1001
00:46:02.927 --> 00:46:07.231
Eventually. his son John
not only began to speak.

1002
00:46:07.231 --> 00:46:08.866
but to excel.

1003
00:46:08.866 --> 00:46:11.602
Sowell wrote about
this remarkable journey

1004
00:46:11.602 --> 00:46:15.606
in his landmark book.
"Late-Talking Children."

1005
00:46:15.606 --> 00:46:17.608
Tom discovered
that there was a syndrome.

1007
00:46:21.579 --> 00:46:25.316

acute spatial ability

was Los Angeles-based writer

whose own young son. Sam.

1012
00:46:38.729 --> 00:46:41.165
wasn't talking at all.

00:46:41.165 --> 00:46:42.967
When Sam was about
18 months old.

1014
00:46:42.967 --> 00:46:44.702
he wasn't really talking.

1015
00:46:44.702 --> 00:46:46.604
He -- just babbling.

1016
00:46:46.604 --> 00:46:50.608
No word that we could make out
to be an English word.

1017
00:46:50.608 --> 00:46:54.879
So I started looking online
and saw late-talking children.

1018
00:46:54.879 --> 00:46:57.148
and then Dr. Thomas
Sowell. and said.

1019
00:46:57.148 --> 00:47:00.084
oh. I definitely want to read
what he has to say

1020
00:47:00.084 --> 00:47:03.120
because I respect him
as an intellectual.

1021
00:47:05.022 --> 00:47:06.424
I had already noticed in Sam

1022
00:47:06.424 --> 00:47:10.161
that he would build different
block towers

1023
00:47:10.161 --> 00:47:12.596
with different patterns
repeating over and over.

1024
00:47:12.596 --> 00:47:16.400
He would have movies
that he just loved watching

1025
00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:19.770
over and over. and one of them
was "Charlotte's Web."

1026
00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:21.339
Another one was "Shrek."

1027
00:47:21.339 --> 00:47:24.742
And so I would come and find
ABC blocks on the floor

1028
00:47:24.742 --> 00:47:27.978
or on the refrigerator
spelling out --

1029
00:47:27.978 --> 00:47:30.414
and he'd even write out
"Lucasfilm."

[ Laughs ]

1031
00:47:31.882 --> 00:47:36.220
Which is pretty big for
a three-year-old to be able to do.

1032
00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:40.191
So the fact that Sowell's book
talked about bright children.

1033
00:47:40.191 --> 00:47:41.592
I thought. I don't
think he's dumb.

1034
00:47:41.592 --> 00:47:42.993
Let's look into this.

1035
00:47:42.993 --> 00:47:49.300
So went to go see Dr. Camarata.
to get an evaluation.

1036
00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:53.771
And they gave us a full plan
of what we could do to help him

1037
00:47:53.771 --> 00:47:56.607
to be able to acquire language
and be successful in school.

When Sam started piano
and he had been so advanced

1040

in that first year.
at the end of the year

1041
00:48:03.814 --> 00:48:06.450
they had a recital.
and he still wasn't talking
