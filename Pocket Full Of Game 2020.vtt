I'm here to make sure my

187

Motherfucking Starbucks
employees could afford

232
00:11:44.312 --> 00:11:46.227
to make mistakes.

233
00:11:46.227 --> 00:11:47.402
Motherfuckers who work at
Burger King and McDonalds

234
00:11:47.402 --> 00:11:49.012
could afford to make mistakes.

235
00:11:49.012 --> 00:11:50.579
One mistake in our line of work

236
00:11:50.579 --> 00:11:53.016
will get you head
blown off. man.

237
00:11:53.016 --> 00:11:56.237
That bitch of yours almost
got me killed last night.

238
00:11:56.237 --> 00:11:58.718
If that nigga's aim had
been slightly better.

239
00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.850
this wouldn't be a
bandage over my face.

240
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.286
It'll be a fucking ziplock.

241
00:12:08.249 --> 00:12:10.207
I'm telling y'all man.
that shit was real sloppy.

242
00:12:10.207 --> 00:12:12.557
It could have gotten me
shot and one of us killed.

243
00:12:12.557 --> 00:12:14.385
- Yo I spoke to her
about that. Fresh.

244
00:12:14.385 --> 00:12:16.039
- Fuck a talk. she's out. man.

245

but she's loyal!

249
00:12:22.916 --> 00:12:25.440
- I remember the last time a
nigga in this crew slipped up.

250
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.096
Yeah. Cash knows the
answer to that one.

251
00:12:29.096 --> 00:12:31.359
I did 10 years behind that shit.

252
00:12:31.359 --> 00:12:33.100
Behind another nigga's slip up.

253
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.754
Shit ain't happening again.

254
00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:36.277
And her cut of the money

255
00:12:36.277 --> 00:12:38.148

part of the take.

Your bitch. your idea to
bring her in. your money.

Ain't no way in hell I'm

who almost got my head
blown the fuck off. man.

259
00:12:44.459 --> 00:12:46.113
- But that's gonna mean
we gonna need a new hook.

260
00:12:46.113 --> 00:12:47.636
- New hook?

261
00:12:47.636 --> 00:12:49.551
Yo. despite what
happened last night.

262
00:12:49.551 --> 00:12:51.988
Lady's the only female I trust
to hold my life in her hands.

263
00:12:51.988 --> 00:12:53.468
I don't trust these
other bitches!

264
00:12:53.468 --> 00:12:54.643
- She's out. man.

265
00:12:54.643 --> 00:12:56.558
You saw how shook she got

266
00:12:56.558 --> 00:12:58.647
after I blew that nigga's
head off last night. man.

267
00:12:58.647 --> 00:13:00.214
- Yo. Bone.

268
00:13:00.214 --> 00:13:01.215
You think Lady gonna
keep her mouth shut

269
00:13:01.215 --> 00:13:02.216

270
00:13:02.216 --> 00:13:03.434
- [Bone] Of course!

271

can't tell the police

- Yo. don't you
think I know that?

275
00:13:10.137 --> 00:13:12.922
I'd take her out myself if
I knew she was gonna snitch!

705
00:31:57.393 --> 00:31:59.918
- [Silk] Looking out for
my fucking ass. yeah.

706
00:31:59.918 --> 00:32:02.137
- Yeah. like I told you.
take it how you want.

707
00:32:02.137 --> 00:32:03.747
Does Porsha know about us?

708
00:32:03.747 --> 00:32:05.271
- No.

709
00:32:05.271 --> 00:32:06.315
- [Fresh] Good.
keep it that way.

710
00:32:07.534 --> 00:32:09.057
- What. she's better than me?

711
00:32:09.057 --> 00:32:10.667
- Listen. does she know or not?

712
00:32:11.886 --> 00:32:12.713
- No.

713
00:32:13.627 --> 00:32:14.715
But I'ma tell her.

714
00:32:18.719 --> 00:32:20.851
- Silk. stay the fuck out
my motherfucking business.

715
00:32:20.851 --> 00:32:22.462
Your only fucking warning.

716
00:32:24.551 --> 00:32:26.727
- You need to keep your
hands to your fucking self.

717
00:32:27.815 --> 00:32:28.816
- All right. I'm ready. guys.

718
00:32:28.816 --> 00:32:30.209
Let's go. let's go.

719
00:32:30.209 --> 00:32:31.558
Bye girl. come on.

720
00:32:31.558 --> 00:32:32.472
- Have a good one.

721
00:32:35.257 --> 00:32:37.956
[hip hop music]

722
00:32:40.219 --> 00:32:41.481
- Motherfucker.

723
00:32:43.222 --> 00:32:46.007
[doorbell dinging]

724
00:32:46.007 --> 00:32:47.356
- Who is it?

725
00:32:47.356 --> 00:32:48.357
- It's Lady.

726
00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:54.407
What's up. Fresh?

727
00:33:00.543 --> 00:33:02.110
- [Announcer] There's
Avery Bradley.

728
00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:03.982
Other than that. all
19 belong to Javale.

729
00:33:03.982 --> 00:33:06.288
Dwight Howard or Anthony Dave.

730
00:33:06.288 --> 00:33:08.160
- [Announcer] Over
Javale sometimes

731
00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.378
and go and balance like
that on the Thunder

732
00:33:09.378 --> 00:33:10.901
could be a real chewer.

733
00:33:10.901 --> 00:33:11.728
- What's up?

734
00:33:11.728 --> 00:33:13.426
- What's up Ma?

735
00:33:13.426 --> 00:33:15.428
How you been babe?

736
00:33:15.428 --> 00:33:17.517
Let's have some you time.

737
00:33:19.562 --> 00:33:22.870
- Yo Bone. let me
holla at you. man.

738
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:25.481
- [sighing] Take
my seat one minute.

739
00:33:25.481 --> 00:33:27.005
- [Announcer] And
that's Anthony Davis.

740
00:33:27.005 --> 00:33:29.181
But the pocket is picked.

741
00:33:29.181 --> 00:33:31.357
Taken by Bullard to score!

742
00:33:33.315 --> 00:33:34.490
- What's up. bro?

743
00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:35.578
- You didn't tell her. did you?

744
00:33:35.578 --> 00:33:37.102
- You know. bro.

745
00:33:37.102 --> 00:33:38.277
I was really thinking
this could work out

746
00:33:38.277 --> 00:33:39.713
with two broads. bro.

747
00:33:41.236 --> 00:33:43.238
I think so man. it could happen.

748
00:33:43.238 --> 00:33:44.109
- No. man.

749
00:33:44.109 --> 00:33:45.632
No is no.

750
00:33:45.632 --> 00:33:47.373
- Yo. I know Lady
botched that last job

751
00:33:47.373 --> 00:33:48.939
but she's loyal.

752
00:33:48.939 --> 00:33:50.985
We don't know
nothing about Porsha.

753
00:33:50.985 --> 00:33:52.552
- Listen. man.

754
00:33:52.552 --> 00:33:53.727
I told you I'm not
dealing with her.

755
00:33:53.727 --> 00:33:55.424
She almost got me killed. man.

756
00:33:55.424 --> 00:33:57.296
- So you're making
decisions for all of us now?

757
00:33:57.296 --> 00:33:59.689
- Cash agreed. it's
majority rules. man.

758
00:33:59.689 --> 00:34:01.865
[sighing]

759
00:34:06.174 --> 00:34:07.567
Lady. let me holler at you.

760
00:34:09.569 --> 00:34:11.527
- Yo. I'm telling
you. sun is nice.

761
00:34:11.527 --> 00:34:12.528
- He aigh't.

762
00:34:12.528 --> 00:34:13.703
- What?

763
00:34:13.703 --> 00:34:14.965
He just made five in a row.

764
00:34:14.965 --> 00:34:16.184
Watch him make this next shot.

765
00:34:16.184 --> 00:34:17.185
- We'll see.

766
00:34:17.185 --> 00:34:18.447
- I got a stack on it.

767
00:34:18.447 --> 00:34:20.058
- Go ahead.

768
00:34:20.058 --> 00:34:20.884
- Ugh!

769
00:34:22.712 --> 00:34:25.193
- We no longer need
your services. Ma.

770
00:34:25.193 --> 00:34:26.760
- What do you mean?

771
00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.066
- I mean you out the crew.

772
00:34:29.284 --> 00:34:30.807
- Look.

773
00:34:30.807 --> 00:34:32.592
I know I fucked up
last time. all right?

774
00:34:32.592 --> 00:34:33.984
I messed up.

775
00:34:33.984 --> 00:34:35.899
You know. but come on.

776
00:34:35.899 --> 00:34:38.163
- Listen. you out. end
of discussion. man.

777
00:34:40.426 --> 00:34:41.731
- You knew about this?

778
00:34:42.689 --> 00:34:44.386
- Go home. Lady.

779
00:34:44.386 --> 00:34:47.911
Go home. we'll talk later. go.

780
00:34:47.911 --> 00:34:49.565
Just go home. Lady.

781
00:34:49.565 --> 00:34:51.089
- No.

782
00:34:51.089 --> 00:34:52.351
Hell motherfucking no.

783
00:34:57.617 --> 00:34:58.922
This is the weak ass bitch

784
00:34:58.922 --> 00:35:01.099
y'all niggas replacing me with?

785
00:35:01.099 --> 00:35:03.101
This prissy ass bitch?

786
00:35:03.101 --> 00:35:04.711
The fuck out of here.

787
00:35:04.711 --> 00:35:06.974
- [Porsha] Fuck out
of here. come over.

788
00:35:08.062 --> 00:35:09.498
- Yo man. yo. calm down. man.

789
00:35:09.498 --> 00:35:10.847
What the hell y'all doing. man?

790
00:35:10.847 --> 00:35:12.284
Chill. man. chill out. man.

791
00:35:12.284 --> 00:35:13.763
- [Porsha] Get off of me.

792
00:35:13.763 --> 00:35:14.938
get off of me!
- Chill. man. chill.

793
00:35:14.938 --> 00:35:16.114
- [Lady] You fucking bitch!

794
00:35:16.114 --> 00:35:17.245
- [Porsha] Shut the fuck up.

795
00:35:17.245 --> 00:35:18.333
- [Lady] Get the fuck off me.

796
00:35:18.333 --> 00:35:19.160
[gun clacking]

797
00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.335
- What now. huh?

798
00:35:20.335 --> 00:35:21.858
Who's the prissy bitch now. huh?

799
00:35:21.858 --> 00:35:23.382
- Yo. Fresh. look
what's she doing. man!

800
00:35:23.382 --> 00:35:25.210
- This shit would
have never happened

801
00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:26.385
if you'd told her she
was out of the crew. man.

802
00:35:26.385 --> 00:35:27.908
- Now you listen to me. okay?

803
00:35:27.908 --> 00:35:29.605
The next time you disrespect me.

804
00:35:29.605 --> 00:35:31.781
I'ma pull this trigger.

805
00:35:31.781 --> 00:35:33.435
But I'ma let you
go back to living

806
00:35:33.435 --> 00:35:34.610
your pathetic little life

807
00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:35.872
after you apologize to me.

808
00:35:37.483 --> 00:35:38.310
Now say sorry.

809
00:35:41.008 --> 00:35:44.446
Say sorry. I'ma pull this
motherfucking trigger!

810
00:35:44.446 --> 00:35:45.273
- I'm sorry.

811
00:35:47.275 --> 00:35:48.450
- I can't hear you.

812
00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:50.278
I need it to be a little louder.

813
00:35:50.278 --> 00:35:51.453
I need you to say
"Porsha. I'm sorry

814
00:35:51.453 --> 00:35:53.107
"for disrespecting you."

815
00:35:54.543 --> 00:35:57.590
- Porsha. I'm sorry
for disrespecting you.

816
00:35:57.590 --> 00:35:59.418
- Good girl.

817
00:35:59.418 --> 00:36:02.377
Now you can go back to
living a simple minded ass

818
00:36:02.377 --> 00:36:03.726
out of here.

819
00:36:03.726 --> 00:36:05.206
- It's not over.

820
00:36:05.206 --> 00:36:07.687
- [Porsha] Walk
out of here. bitch.

821
00:36:07.687 --> 00:36:10.690
[car horns honking]

822
00:36:14.868 --> 00:36:16.174
- Porsha called me
an hour ago man.

823
00:36:16.174 --> 00:36:18.045
tomorrow night we go in.

824
00:36:18.045 --> 00:36:19.177
You good with that?

825
00:36:20.917 --> 00:36:22.180
- Yeah bro.

826
00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:24.182
- Why I ain't convinced. man?

827
00:36:24.182 --> 00:36:25.835
- What you talking about?

828
00:36:25.835 --> 00:36:27.924
- You know what
I'm talking about.

829
00:36:27.924 --> 00:36:29.796
- I said I'm good. bro.

830
00:36:32.364 --> 00:36:34.192
- Get the shit off
your chest. nigga.

831
00:36:38.065 --> 00:36:40.067
- Yo. that shit that
bitch did was foul.

832
00:36:41.503 --> 00:36:43.375
- Bone. Lady stepped
to her first. man.

833
00:36:44.767 --> 00:36:46.291
- Nah. bro.

834
00:36:46.291 --> 00:36:47.422
She went way beyond
defending herself.

835
00:36:47.422 --> 00:36:49.859
She crossed boundaries!

836
00:36:49.859 --> 00:36:51.687
- What she did was no different

837
00:36:51.687 --> 00:36:53.211
than what me and you did
when we was on island. man.

838
00:36:53.211 --> 00:36:54.734
If a nigga steps
us. we cut his face

839
00:36:54.734 --> 00:36:56.779
so fucking bad. he and
everybody else watching

840
00:36:56.779 --> 00:36:58.433
knew not to fuck with us. man.

841
00:36:58.433 --> 00:37:00.870
- [banging] This ain't
the island. Fresh!

842
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:02.263
This ain't the yard!

843
00:37:02.263 --> 00:37:04.091
She went too far.

844
00:37:04.091 --> 00:37:05.092
She even pointed a gun at me

845
00:37:05.092 --> 00:37:07.225
and I don't go for that!

846
00:37:07.225 --> 00:37:09.879
Who's to say she won't
go too far on the job?

847
00:37:09.879 --> 00:37:11.968
We don't know nothing
about this broad.

848
00:37:11.968 --> 00:37:13.535
- Listen. Bone.

849
00:37:13.535 --> 00:37:15.102
Would we be having
this conversation

850
00:37:15.102 --> 00:37:16.973
if it wasn't your
bitch who fucked up?

851
00:37:16.973 --> 00:37:18.497
- Her being my bitch ain't
got nothing to do with this!

852
00:37:18.497 --> 00:37:20.063
- It has everything to
fucking do with it. man.

853
00:37:21.369 --> 00:37:22.936
Honestly speaking. man.

854
00:37:22.936 --> 00:37:24.111
Do you think Lady would
have passed that test

855
00:37:24.111 --> 00:37:25.373
we put Porsha through. man?

856
00:37:25.373 --> 00:37:26.635
You saw how damn shook she got

857
00:37:26.635 --> 00:37:28.158
after I murdered Goldie!

858
00:37:28.158 --> 00:37:29.595
This is real talk.
nigga. do you?

859
00:37:31.031 --> 00:37:33.076
- I don't know
and we won't know.

860
00:37:33.076 --> 00:37:34.382
Now I understand why
you had to cut her crew

861
00:37:34.382 --> 00:37:35.253
from the loose.

862
00:37:37.516 --> 00:37:39.039
[sighing]

863
00:37:39.039 --> 00:37:41.433
I just don't trust this
bitch. I just don't.

864
00:37:44.436 --> 00:37:45.437
- The fuck you
keep looking at me

865
00:37:45.437 --> 00:37:46.438
like that for. Bone?

866
00:37:46.438 --> 00:37:47.134
- You fucked her?

867
00:37:47.134 --> 00:37:47.961
- What?

868
00:37:47.961 --> 00:37:48.788
- You heard me.

869
00:37:48.788 --> 00:37:49.963
You fucked her?

870
00:37:49.963 --> 00:37:50.833
- Hell no I ain't fuck her.

871
00:37:53.053 --> 00:37:54.620
Listen Bone.
Porsha's in the crew.

872
00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:55.925
she ain't going nowhere.

873
00:37:55.925 --> 00:37:57.100
Bitch like that is too valuable

874
00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:58.667
to what we got going on.

875
00:37:58.667 --> 00:37:59.668
You're gonna have
to get used to it.

876
00:37:59.668 --> 00:38:00.887
- And if I don't?

877
00:38:02.628 --> 00:38:03.672
What. her over me?

878
00:38:03.672 --> 00:38:05.500
I'm expendable?

879
00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:06.414
- You talking stupid. Bone.

880
00:38:06.414 --> 00:38:07.981
- I am?
- Yeah.

881
00:38:10.592 --> 00:38:12.290
Listen. hear me out. Bone.

882
00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:14.292
We've been brothers

01:06:55.881 --> 01:06:57.361
- I don't know about that. Silk.

1584
01:06:58.231 --> 01:06:59.580
- What you mean?

1585
01:07:00.799 --> 01:07:02.670
- I don't know.

1586
01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:04.150
The reason why I left is because

1587
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:06.761
that Don V job. that
shit fucked my head up.

1588
01:07:06.761 --> 01:07:10.113
And [sighing] I needed
to get my mind right.

1589
01:07:10.113 --> 01:07:11.636
between my mind.

1590
01:07:11.636 --> 01:07:13.377
and trust me. that trip
got me to thinking.

1591
01:07:14.465 --> 01:07:16.467
I'm getting out the game. Silk.

1592
01:07:16.467 --> 01:07:17.816
- What you mean?

1593
01:07:18.991 --> 01:07:19.818
Porsha.

1594
01:07:21.559 --> 01:07:23.561
I don't know nobody
that go harder than you.

1595
01:07:23.561 --> 01:07:25.519
What are you talking about?

1596
01:07:25.519 --> 01:07:27.043
- I'm getting out the game.

1597
01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:29.697
I'm not gonna stop
chasing the bank but.

1598
01:07:29.697 --> 01:07:30.916
I'm leaving the drug dealing

1599
01:07:30.916 --> 01:07:32.178
and the robbing niggas behind.

1600
01:07:32.178 --> 01:07:33.875
I can't keep doing this shit.

1601
01:07:33.875 --> 01:07:35.094
- Fuck these niggas.

1602
01:07:35.094 --> 01:07:37.749
- I might end up
in jail or dead.

1603
01:07:37.749 --> 01:07:39.707
If I keep going like this?

1604
01:07:39.707 --> 01:07:42.754
I can't do it no
more. Silk. it's over.

1605
01:07:42.754 --> 01:07:45.713
I gotta think of something
bigger than this.

1606
01:07:47.106 --> 01:07:48.890
- So what's the plan.
what you wanna do?

1607
01:07:48.890 --> 01:07:50.457
- I haven't really
thought about it

1608
01:07:50.457 --> 01:07:52.329
but maybe. I don't
know. some stocks.

1609
01:07:52.329 --> 01:07:54.026
Maybe flipping some property.

1610
01:07:55.114 --> 01:07:56.855
I don't know. anything.

1611
01:07:56.855 --> 01:07:59.771
But the streets is not
an option anymore. Silk.

1612
01:08:01.164 --> 01:08:02.426
- [Silk] Come on.
let's get in the car.

1613
01:08:02.426 --> 01:08:04.254
We'll talk in the car.

1614
01:08:05.603 --> 01:08:06.778
- Bitch. you need to think about

1615
01:08:06.778 --> 01:08:07.822
getting out the game too.

1616
01:08:09.607 --> 01:08:11.739
Like the same rules that
apply to me apply to you.

1617
01:08:11.739 --> 01:08:13.959
You stay in this hustle
for one minute too long

1618
01:08:13.959 --> 01:08:16.788
and that's it. it's
game over no resets.

1619
01:08:16.788 --> 01:08:18.137
And when it happens.
you're not even gonna

1620
01:08:18.137 --> 01:08:19.312
see it coming.

1621
01:08:19.312 --> 01:08:20.270
That's the fucked up part.

1622
01:08:22.533 --> 01:08:24.404
I know you're not listening.
you're not convinced

1623
01:08:24.404 --> 01:08:25.971
'cause we've been hustling

1624
01:08:25.971 --> 01:08:28.539
you know since we
was kids. I get it.

1625
01:08:28.539 --> 01:08:31.455
But girl. there's
bigger things out there.

1626
01:08:31.455 --> 01:08:32.891
We can't just stay
in the streets

1627
01:08:32.891 --> 01:08:34.632
the rest of our lives.

1628
01:08:34.632 --> 01:08:36.112
Think about it.

1629
01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:36.938
- Yeah. I got you.

1630
01:08:36.938 --> 01:08:37.765
- You sure?

1631
01:08:39.202 --> 01:08:40.899
I need you to really
think about this.

1632
01:08:40.899 --> 01:08:42.466
I'm getting out the game

1633
01:08:42.466 --> 01:08:46.339
and I don't need you
in the game as well.

1634
01:08:46.339 --> 01:08:47.427
I don't know.

1635
01:08:48.341 --> 01:08:49.429
In the meantime though.

1636
01:08:50.561 --> 01:08:52.519
I like one or two more favors.

1637
01:08:52.519 --> 01:08:54.913
You gonna come rock
with me on this?

1638
01:08:54.913 --> 01:08:56.523
- [Silk] That's what
I'm talking about.

1639
01:08:56.523 --> 01:08:57.698
- All right babe.

1640
01:08:57.698 --> 01:08:59.874

01:09:39.479 --> 01:09:40.654
I've been calling your phone

1660
01:09:40.654 --> 01:09:42.178
for like a whole week now.

1661
01:09:42.178 --> 01:09:43.440
We're losing crazy
money out here.

1662
01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:45.181
- What you mean?

1663
01:09:45.181 --> 01:09:47.313
Chase didn't come last
week to hit y'all off?

1664
01:09:47.313 --> 01:09:48.923
- Hell no.

1665
01:09:48.923 --> 01:09:50.447
I've been calling his
cellphone like crazy.

1666
01:09:50.447 --> 01:09:51.622
Nobody even seen
the nigga either.

1667
01:09:51.622 --> 01:09:52.797
- Get the fuck outta here.

1668
01:09:52.797 --> 01:09:54.973
Aight. I'ma see y'all in a bit.

1669
01:09:58.846 --> 01:10:00.631
Yo Silk. you seen Chase?

1670
01:10:00.631 --> 01:10:02.807
- Nah. not since you left.

1671
01:10:02.807 --> 01:10:04.156
- Are you serious?

1672
01:10:04.156 --> 01:10:05.288
- I'm dead serious.

1673
01:10:05.288 --> 01:10:06.898
- Oh my fucking God. this.

1674
01:10:06.898 --> 01:10:08.508
All right. let's go
see 2Gs real quick.

1675
01:10:08.508 --> 01:10:09.683
I gotta pull up on him.

1676
01:10:09.683 --> 01:10:11.032
I gotta see where Chase is at.

1677
01:10:11.032 --> 01:10:13.252
- All right. we out.

1678
01:10:13.252 --> 01:10:14.949
- What's up. you know you
look good. right baby?

1679
01:10:14.949 --> 01:10:16.429
- Thank you.

1680
01:10:16.429 --> 01:10:17.430
- [2Gs] What's up.
what you doing later?

1681
01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:18.953
- What you wanna do?

1682
01:10:18.953 --> 01:10:20.433
- I'm gonna have some
fun. I know that.

1683
01:10:20.433 --> 01:10:21.739
- All right. so
let's go somewhere.

1684
01:10:21.739 --> 01:10:23.654
- [2Gs] All right. babe.

1685
01:10:23.654 --> 01:10:25.525
- [Porsha] Yo. 2Gs.

1686
01:10:25.525 --> 01:10:27.614
Have you seen Chase?

1687
01:10:27.614 --> 01:10:29.834
- No I ain't seen him.
I'm waiting for him.

1688
01:10:29.834 --> 01:10:31.183
- So he ain't come get you

1689
01:10:31.183 --> 01:10:32.663
to cook the work last week?

1690
01:10:32.663 --> 01:10:34.447
- No. and he not
answering the phone.

1691
01:10:35.448 --> 01:10:37.015
- Oh my god.

1692
01:10:37.015 --> 01:10:38.016
- What's up. but
you still need me?

1693
01:10:38.016 --> 01:10:39.191
- Nah. yo. we're good.

1694
01:10:39.191 --> 01:10:40.714
I'ma hit you up in a little bit.

1695
01:10:40.714 --> 01:10:41.280
- All right.
- Come on. let's go. let's go.

1696
01:10:44.327 --> 01:10:45.632
[tense music]

1697
01:10:45.632 --> 01:10:47.243
Oh my god.

1698
01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:48.244
He's not here.

1699
01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:54.424
He took everything.

1700
01:10:54.424 --> 01:10:55.990
Everything. that's
the last of it.

1701
01:10:58.558 --> 01:11:00.821
Let's go. come on. get
the fuck outta here.

1702
01:11:02.432 --> 01:11:04.695
[knocking]

1703
01:11:07.045 --> 01:11:09.265
- Knocking at my door. man.

1704
01:11:13.007 --> 01:11:14.139
- You gonna let me in?

1705
01:11:15.575 --> 01:11:17.055
Man I'm not in the
mood for your shit.

1706
01:11:17.055 --> 01:11:18.622
- You think I care
about what mood you in?

1707
01:11:18.622 --> 01:11:20.363
You leave the crew
hanging on a job.

1708
01:11:20.363 --> 01:11:21.538
come back a week later.
talking about what mood you in?

1709
01:11:21.538 --> 01:11:23.104
Who you think you are. man?

1710
01:11:23.104 --> 01:11:24.802
- Fresh. I made a
mistake. I'm human.

1711
01:11:24.802 --> 01:11:26.194
- And you know how I
feel about mistakes

1712
01:11:26.194 --> 01:11:27.457
in this line of work. man.

1713
01:11:28.893 --> 01:11:30.416
- Fresh. come on.
- Listen. man.

1714
01:11:30.416 --> 01:11:31.939
I fought my nigga to
keep you in this crew.

1715
01:11:31.939 --> 01:11:33.724
The nigga who got my
back since the sandbox.

1716
01:11:33.724 --> 01:11:36.248
I did that shit 'cause I
thought you was worth it. man.

1717
01:11:36.248 --> 01:11:38.163
- Oh so me rocking
Don V's bitch to sleep

1718
01:11:38.163 --> 01:11:39.991
isn't enough to hold
down my position?

1719
01:11:39.991 --> 01:11:41.471
- Hell no.

1720
01:11:41.471 --> 01:11:42.950
There's more to being
part of this crew

1721
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:43.951
than just squeezing
triggers. man.

1722
01:11:43.951 --> 01:11:45.518
- Oh yeah. like what?

1723
01:11:45.518 --> 01:11:46.519
- Loyalty. we don't run
out on each other. man.

1724
01:11:46.519 --> 01:11:47.520
- I didn't run out!

1725
01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:48.695
- The hell you didn't.

1726
01:11:48.695 --> 01:11:50.306
You knew we had a job to do.

1727
01:11:50.306 --> 01:11:51.437
Instead of being here
to hold down your part

1728
01:11:51.437 --> 01:11:52.699
you chose to run off to Atlanta.

1729
01:11:54.179 --> 01:11:55.746
- How'd you know
I was in Atlanta?

1730
01:11:55.746 --> 01:11:57.704
- Listen man. it doesn't
matter how I know.

1731
01:11:57.704 --> 01:11:58.836
What matters is you weren't here

1732
01:11:58.836 --> 01:12:00.054
when we needed you. man.

1733
01:12:01.099 --> 01:12:02.622
- Fresh. I'm sorry.

1734
01:12:02.622 --> 01:12:04.407
That Don V job.
that messed me up.

1735
01:12:04.407 --> 01:12:05.930
That sliced open body.

1736
01:12:05.930 --> 01:12:07.105
rocking his bitch to sleep.

1737
01:12:07.105 --> 01:12:08.628
that shit messed with my head.

1738
01:12:08.628 --> 01:12:09.803
I've been seeing
that in my dreams.

1739
01:12:09.803 --> 01:12:11.065
I needed to get away.

1740
01:12:11.065 --> 01:12:12.763
I needed to clear my head.

1741
01:12:14.504 --> 01:12:16.070
And of course what me and
you did the other day.

1742
01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:17.289
- So what happens the
next time you gotta

1743
01:12:17.289 --> 01:12:18.812
body another motherfucker?

1744
01:12:18.812 --> 01:12:20.684
The next time you
see too much blood.

1745
01:12:20.684 --> 01:12:21.946
you gonna run out on us
again like a coward. man?

1746
01:12:21.946 --> 01:12:23.469
- Come on. Fresh.

1747
01:12:23.469 --> 01:12:24.601
- I can't keep putting
my crew in jeopardy

1748
01:12:24.601 --> 01:12:26.211
over you. man.

1749
01:12:26.211 --> 01:12:27.343
I can't keep taking
chances on you. man.

1750
01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:28.866
First you bailed out on me

1751
01:12:28.866 --> 01:12:30.346
when me and you
had an altercation.

1752
01:12:30.346 --> 01:12:31.912
then you bailed on

where we have two men
that were murdered.

1870

one of the residents

1871
01:15:57.509 --> 01:15:59.990
of the building where
the men were murdered.

1872

Did you see anything.

1879
01:16:10.087 --> 01:16:11.610

01:16:11.610 --> 01:16:14.004
but I heard gunshots
from my apartment.

1881
01:16:14.004 --> 01:16:17.050
It was pretty scary.
it was in succession.

1882

quiet building.

- As a matter of fact. I did.

1930
01:17:55.627 --> 01:17:58.717
- Did you see anyone
fleeing the scene

1931
01:17:58.717 --> 01:18:00.937
or leaving from anywhere?

1932
01:18:00.937 --> 01:18:02.242
Anything you might
be able to tell us

1933
01:18:02.242 --> 01:18:03.548
that can help?

1934
01:18:05.245 --> 01:18:08.118
- Oh I saw a young lady
leaving one of the apartments.

1935
01:18:08.118 --> 01:18:10.250
- [Detective Lewis] About how
tall would you say she was?

1936
01:18:10.250 --> 01:18:12.644
- Between 5'4 or 5'5.

1937

- She was either Hispanic
of African-American.

1939
01:18:18.215 --> 01:18:20.870

young lady was wearing?

1940
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:25.222
- She had on a black hoodie

1941

- Was she alone?

1943
01:18:28.225 --> 01:18:29.748
- Yes she was alone

1944
01:18:29.748 --> 01:18:30.880
because I remember
she was carrying

1945
01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:32.708
this rather heavy bag.

1946
01:18:32.708 --> 01:18:34.535
And it was difficult
for her to carry.

1947
01:18:34.535 --> 01:18:36.102
- Okay.

- He's rather respectful.
nice young man.

coming and going at
all hours of the night

1955
01:18:51.901 --> 01:18:53.467
from his apartment.

1956
01:18:53.467 --> 01:18:54.730

for a long time.

Misconception confuse things.

For an example. you
have a misconception

01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:51.411
It's not gonna happen.

2004
01:20:51.411 --> 01:20:53.674
It's gonna start
by you telling us

2005
01:20:53.674 --> 01:20:54.719
where the gun is.

2006
01:20:54.719 --> 01:20:55.851
- What gun?

2007
01:20:55.851 --> 01:20:57.026

01:20:57.026 --> 01:20:58.636
coming down the staircase with.

2009
01:20:58.636 --> 01:21:00.464

- Man. I don't know
nothing about no murder.

2019

I don't know shit.

01:21:19.135 --> 01:21:21.137
- But you know Miguel
Lopez. don't you?

2021

don't mean I killed him.

2023
01:21:23.617 --> 01:21:24.444
- But how do you know him?

2024
01:21:24.444 --> 01:21:25.445
- He's a friend.

2025
01:21:25.445 --> 01:21:26.882

- No. Miss Garcia.

2028
01:21:30.798 --> 01:21:32.888
He's not just a friend.

He's your plug.

2030
01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:37.457
In fact. I know he was!

I bet my pension on it.

call on his cellphone

- [speaks in foreign
language] bad.

2103
01:24:11.046 --> 01:24:12.873
You fucked up.

2104
01:24:12.873 --> 01:24:14.614
You fucked up bad.

2105
01:24:15.833 --> 01:24:16.660
Real bad.

2106
01:24:37.681 --> 01:24:39.030
- [Guard] Come on. come on.

2107
01:24:46.342 --> 01:24:48.605
[clacking]

2108
01:25:00.834 --> 01:25:02.706
- Same shit again?

2109
01:25:02.706 --> 01:25:03.924
- Come on ladies. hurry up.

2110
01:25:03.924 --> 01:25:05.100
Let's move this line.

2111
01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:06.492
Let's go. let's go. let's go.

2112
01:25:07.450 --> 01:25:08.277
- Really?

2113
01:25:11.715 --> 01:25:13.586
- Yo. I heard you
got a new bunkie?

2114
01:25:13.586 --> 01:25:16.676
- Oh shit. are you serious?

2115
01:25:16.676 --> 01:25:17.590
Where is she?

2116
01:25:19.114 --> 01:25:20.419
- That's what it is.

2117
01:25:20.419 --> 01:25:22.421
- Then stop coming back.

2118
01:25:33.258 --> 01:25:34.825
Hey. you got a extra hotdog.

2119
01:25:34.825 --> 01:25:35.826
you're eating for two.

2120
01:25:35.826 --> 01:25:36.957
- [Inmate] Oh yeah.

2121
01:25:36.957 --> 01:25:38.307
Thank you so much.

2122
01:25:38.307 --> 01:25:39.177
- You're welcome.

2123
01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:46.489
- Can I get another juice?

2124
01:25:47.707 --> 01:25:49.274
- No.

2125
01:25:49.274 --> 01:25:52.669
- [Guard] Just grab your
tray and let's move it.

2126
01:25:57.761 --> 01:26:00.938
- Dog food look
better than this shit.

2127
01:26:03.897 --> 01:26:05.247
- What's wrong with you?

2128
01:26:05.247 --> 01:26:06.248
Had a bad day?
- Nothing. what's wrong

2129
01:26:06.248 --> 01:26:07.553
with you?

2130
01:26:07.553 --> 01:26:08.380
No.

2131
01:26:10.295 --> 01:26:11.557
- Here. get your cup.

2132
01:26:11.557 --> 01:26:13.429
- Thank you.
- Come on. let's

2133
01:26:13.429 --> 01:26:16.171
move this line. let's move
the line. let's go. ladies.

2134
01:26:16.171 --> 01:26:18.129
- Here we go again.

2135
01:26:18.129 --> 01:26:19.652
Is this ever gonna end?

2136
01:26:19.652 --> 01:26:21.219
- I don't know baby.

2137
01:26:21.219 --> 01:26:22.481
Maybe you should stop
coming back to prison.

2138
01:26:26.877 --> 01:26:28.618
- Can I get two of those?

2139
01:26:28.618 --> 01:26:29.619
- Two of what?

2140
01:26:29.619 --> 01:26:31.142
- Hotdogs.

2141
01:26:31.142 --> 01:26:32.274
- You ain't on.
you ain't pregnant.

2142
01:26:32.274 --> 01:26:33.449
- Oh I gotta be pregnant?

2143
01:26:33.449 --> 01:26:34.406
- Yeah.
- Yeah yeah.

2144
01:26:35.364 --> 01:26:37.714
- You on a special diet.

2145
01:26:37.714 --> 01:26:39.150
Jeez. I tell you.

2146
01:26:42.893 --> 01:26:44.068
- Who the fuck are you?

2147
01:26:44.068 --> 01:26:45.591
- Well. what's your name?

2148
01:26:45.591 --> 01:26:47.202
- Why. you don't know
me and I don't know you.

2149
01:26:47.202 --> 01:26:49.421
- Look. I don't want
any problems. okay?

2150
01:26:49.421 --> 01:26:51.293
I'm just asking your
name. that's all.

2151
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:55.993
- I don't know you.

2152
01:26:55.993 --> 01:26:57.386
- Well I heard
that the two of us

2153
01:26:57.386 --> 01:26:59.431
are gonna be sharing a cell.

2154
01:26:59.431 --> 01:27:01.651
So I just thought
that it would be like

2155
01:27:01.651 --> 01:27:04.610
a good idea for us to
know each other's names.

2156
01:27:04.610 --> 01:27:06.699
I mean it would keep
the tensions down

2157
01:27:06.699 --> 01:27:10.486
between me and you and
around here a little.

2158
01:27:10.486 --> 01:27:13.837
So instead of us you know.
walking around like. hey you.

2159
01:27:15.882 --> 01:27:17.449
No. okay. so.

2160
01:27:17.449 --> 01:27:19.059
What's your name?

2161
01:27:19.059 --> 01:27:20.539
My name is Angel.

2162
01:27:20.539 --> 01:27:22.062
- Porsha.

2163
01:27:22.062 --> 01:27:24.282
- Is that your real name?

2164
01:27:24.282 --> 01:27:26.110
- That's the name
my mother gave me.

2165
01:27:27.894 --> 01:27:30.288
- You ever asked her like
why she named you that?

2166
01:27:32.551 --> 01:27:34.205
- Never really got a chance to.

2167
01:27:34.205 --> 01:27:36.251
She died when I was nine.

2168
01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:38.122
- Oh. I'm sorry to hear that

2169
01:27:38.122 --> 01:27:39.515
but I feel you.

2170
01:27:39.515 --> 01:27:41.081
Mines died when I was only six.

2171
01:27:44.476 --> 01:27:46.652
So like what are you in for?

2172
01:27:48.175 --> 01:27:49.002
- Murder.

2173
01:27:50.221 --> 01:27:52.484
- Who did you kill?

2174
01:27:52.484 --> 01:27:54.051
- Nobody.

2175
01:27:54.051 --> 01:27:54.878
- Oh.

2176
01:27:55.966 --> 01:27:57.489
I'm in for the same thing.

2177
01:27:57.489 --> 01:27:59.230
The only difference
is I actually did it.

2178
01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:03.365
- Who'd you. I mean
why'd you kill him?

2179
01:28:05.192 --> 01:28:06.019
- He raped me.

2180
01:28:09.762 --> 01:28:12.287
Yeah. it's his baby if
that's what you're wondering.

2181
01:28:12.287 --> 01:28:14.114
- Are you serious?

2182
01:28:14.114 --> 01:28:15.290
- As a heart attack.

2183
01:28:19.685 --> 01:28:21.296
It's just. well.

2184
01:28:21.296 --> 01:28:23.776
the first time though
was like the last time

2185
01:28:23.776 --> 01:28:25.517
that I actually had the courage

2186
01:28:25.517 --> 01:28:27.911
to do something about it.

2187
01:28:27.911 --> 01:28:30.217
He raped me so many times
throughout the years.

2188
01:28:30.217 --> 01:28:31.610
I couldn't even keep track.

2189
01:28:34.744 --> 01:28:36.876
- [Porsha] How old are you?

2190
01:28:36.876 --> 01:28:38.225
- I'm 18.

2191
01:28:38.225 --> 01:28:40.706
[tense music]

2192
01:28:42.708 --> 01:28:45.276
So like. Porsha.
do you play spades?

2193
01:28:46.146 --> 01:28:47.017
- Nah. I'm good.

2194
01:28:47.974 --> 01:28:49.367
- Oh. well.

2195
01:28:51.804 --> 01:28:53.240
I'll holla at you later then.

2196
01:28:54.329 --> 01:28:56.243
Bye.

2197
01:28:56.243 --> 01:28:59.116
- [Guard] Come on ladies.
let's eat up. let's eat up.

2198
01:28:59.116 --> 01:29:00.944
[tense music]

2199
01:29:00.944 --> 01:29:02.337
- [Woman] Here we go again.

2200
01:29:14.349 --> 01:29:16.481
- No problems out of
you on your visit.

2201
01:29:16.481 --> 01:29:17.656
I guarantee this will be

2202
01:29:17.656 --> 01:29:19.136
the fastest visit you ever had.

2203
01:29:22.618 --> 01:29:23.445
- Hey boo.

2204
01:29:25.882 --> 01:29:27.362
How you doin?

2205
01:29:27.362 --> 01:29:28.972
What's going on.
how you holding up?

2206
01:29:28.972 --> 01:29:31.714
- It's a process.
girl. but I'm doing it.

2207
01:29:31.714 --> 01:29:33.280
You know ain't no walls

2208
01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:34.630
or barbed wire fence
is gonna break me

2209
01:29:34.630 --> 01:29:35.631
and hold me back.

2210
01:29:35.631 --> 01:29:37.154
- I know that's right.

2211
01:29:37.154 --> 01:29:38.416
You whoop anybody's ass yet

2212
01:29:38.416 --> 01:29:40.375
'cause I know how you are.

2213
01:29:40.375 --> 01:29:42.420
- Nah. girl. I stick to myself.

2214
01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:44.814
If they don't fuck with
me. I don't fuck with them.

2215
01:29:44.814 --> 01:29:46.293
I ain't really
trying to get to know

2216
01:29:46.293 --> 01:29:47.425
none of these bitches in here.

2217
01:29:47.425 --> 01:29:48.818
- I feel you.

2218
01:29:48.818 --> 01:29:50.733
You see anybody we know up here?

2219
01:29:50.733 --> 01:29:52.343
- Nah.

2220
01:29:52.343 --> 01:29:54.214
For the most part
I stay in my cell.

2221
01:29:54.214 --> 01:29:56.695
I'm not really trying
to make friends

2222
01:29:56.695 --> 01:29:58.262
or see friends. nothing.

2223
01:29:59.350 --> 01:30:00.482
- Yeah.

2224
01:30:00.482 --> 01:30:01.483
That's the only way to be.

2225
01:30:01.483 --> 01:30:02.875
Just stick to yourself.

2226
01:30:02.875 --> 01:30:04.573
- It's the only way to be.

2227
01:30:06.270 --> 01:30:08.359
- But overall we're
missing you out there.

2228
01:30:10.970 --> 01:30:12.145
How you feeling?

2229
01:30:12.145 --> 01:30:13.016
- I just miss my freedom.

2230
01:30:15.584 --> 01:30:19.370
- I'm sure you're missing
some dick too. [laughing]

2231
01:30:20.719 --> 01:30:22.155
Girl. we're gonna throw
you the only party

2232
01:30:22.155 --> 01:30:22.982
when you get home.

2233
01:30:22.982 --> 01:30:24.375
I can't wait.

2234
01:30:24.375 --> 01:30:26.246
We turning up.

2235
01:30:26.246 --> 01:30:28.031
- [Guard] Silk. quiet down now.

2236
01:30:28.031 --> 01:30:30.033
- I can't wait my
damn self. shit.

2237
01:30:30.033 --> 01:30:32.296
This shit is for the birds.

2238
01:30:32.296 --> 01:30:33.428
- I know that's right.

2239
01:30:35.386 --> 01:30:38.650
Porsha. you sure you're okay?

2240
01:30:40.347 --> 01:30:44.351
- Yeah I just miss the
streets like crazy sometimes.

2241
01:30:44.351 --> 01:30:46.615
- I know. you're gonna
be out of here soon.

2242
01:30:46.615 --> 01:30:47.703
Soon enough.

2243
01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:52.055
So how's the case going?

2244
01:30:52.055 --> 01:30:53.360
What the lawyers talking about?

2245
01:30:55.493 --> 01:30:56.755
- I mean it's just.

2246
01:30:56.755 --> 01:30:58.235
I really won't know anything

2247
01:30:58.235 --> 01:30:59.628
until my first
preliminary hearing.

2248
01:30:59.628 --> 01:31:02.195
And that could take months.

2249
01:31:02.195 --> 01:31:03.588
- Yeah.

2250
01:31:03.588 --> 01:31:05.547
Have you been speaking
to anyone yet?

2251
01:31:07.287 --> 01:31:09.115
- Yeah. she can't really
tell me nothing new right now

2252
01:31:09.115 --> 01:31:12.336
because I'm not taking
no plea bargain and

2253
01:31:13.816 --> 01:31:15.818
she just told me be
prepared for trial.

2254
01:31:15.818 --> 01:31:17.167
- I feel you.

2255
01:31:17.167 --> 01:31:19.604
- Yo. speaking of my lawyer.

2256
01:31:19.604 --> 01:31:20.779
- [Silk] What's up?

2257
01:31:20.779 --> 01:31:23.042
- I need you to do me a favor.

2258
01:31:24.435 --> 01:31:26.481
The day I got
caught by the cops.

2259
01:31:26.481 --> 01:31:29.179
I stashed a bag full
of money and bricks

2260
01:31:29.179 --> 01:31:30.441
behind that alley at 305.

2261
01:31:32.138 --> 01:31:34.010
I need you to go get that

2262
01:31:34.010 --> 01:31:36.926
and hit my lawyer off for like
a hundred grand. all right?

2263
01:31:36.926 --> 01:31:39.494
I ain't fucking with no
public defender. fuck that.

2264
01:31:40.538 --> 01:31:42.105
Then the rest of the money

2265
01:31:42.105 --> 01:31:43.193
I need you to put
it in the bank.

2266
01:31:43.193 --> 01:31:44.020
- Okay.

2267
01:31:44.020 --> 01:31:45.021
I got you.

2268
01:31:46.501 --> 01:31:48.328
What about the bricks though?

2269
01:31:48.328 --> 01:31:50.766
- Get with 2Gs. put
that shit up. bag it up.

2270
01:31:50.766 --> 01:31:51.941
hit the crew off.

2271
01:31:51.941 --> 01:31:53.508
Just 'cause I'm locked up

2272
01:31:53.508 --> 01:31:55.205
don't mean we can't get
money while I'm in here.

2273
01:31:55.205 --> 01:31:56.902
- I know that's
right. I feel you.

2274
01:31:56.902 --> 01:31:58.513
- I really need you. Silk.

2275
01:31:58.513 --> 01:32:00.776
You're all I got
while I'm in here.

2276
01:32:00.776 --> 01:32:02.865

[inmates chattering in distance]

- Hey!

2285

I didn't see you at chow today.

I brought you something.

2287
01:32:47.605 --> 01:32:50.347
You look like a cooked corned
beef Reuben type of girl.

2288
01:32:50.347 --> 01:32:53.263
- Girl. I cannot eat
that stuff at chow.

2289
01:32:53.263 --> 01:32:55.526
- I completely understand.

2290
01:32:55.526 --> 01:32:57.397
That's why I got my job
in the kitchen though

2291
01:32:57.397 --> 01:33:00.357
'cause I was like that the
first two weeks I got here.

2292
01:33:00.357 --> 01:33:03.490
But you know. I am
eating for two. so.

2293
01:33:03.490 --> 01:33:05.580
that's why I could eat
what I want whenever I want

2294
01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:06.929
in that kitchen.

2295
01:33:06.929 --> 01:33:07.756
- Yeah.

2296
01:33:09.018 --> 01:33:10.410
Can I ask you something?

2297
01:33:10.410 --> 01:33:11.934
- [Angel] Sure. go ahead.

2298
01:33:11.934 --> 01:33:13.500
- What are you gonna do
when the baby's born?

2299
01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:15.590
I mean. what if you get
a lot of time in here?

[sighing]

2301
01:33:18.549 --> 01:33:19.942
- I'm young but I'm not naive.

2302
01:33:21.465 --> 01:33:23.119
I know that as soon
as I have this baby

2303
01:33:23.119 --> 01:33:25.164
they're gonna take
it away from me.

2304

I'm just trying to enjoy
motherhood right now

2305

for as long as I can.

2306
01:33:30.866 --> 01:33:34.565
It's just the only thing
that's keeping my mind

2307
01:33:34.565 --> 01:33:36.393
off the fact that I'm
probably gonna be in here

2308
01:33:36.393 --> 01:33:37.742
for the rest of my life.

2309
01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:41.746
- Don't say that.

2310
01:33:41.746 --> 01:33:43.661
- [Angel] It's the truth.

2311
01:33:43.661 --> 01:33:45.532

- I'd rather not
say. your honor.

2693
01:50:45.813 --> 01:50:49.251
- Ms. Watkins. I cannot help you

2694
01:50:49.251 --> 01:50:52.384
unless you tell me
who you're afraid of.

2695
01:50:54.169 --> 01:50:57.128

to subpoena me. I understand

2696

but can you protect my family?

2697
01:51:00.218 --> 01:51:01.698
- I cannot protect your family

2698

if I don't know who I'm
protecting you from!

2699

stake your honor.

- Ma'am. you gots

After two whole weeks of sitting
at that deliberation table

2707
01:51:31.554 --> 01:51:35.689
you're gonna tell me Miss
Porsha Garcia is not guilty

01:51:35.689 --> 01:51:37.603
'cause she's a woman?

2709
01:51:37.603 --> 01:51:38.735
- No.

2710
01:51:38.735 --> 01:51:40.606
That's not what I'm saying. sir.

2711
01:51:40.606 --> 01:51:42.521
What I'm saying is just because

2712
01:51:42.521 --> 01:51:44.393
she was at the
scene of the crime.

2713
01:51:44.393 --> 01:51:46.656
that doesn't mean she
committed the murder.

2714
01:51:46.656 --> 01:51:48.136
It's a tenement.

2715
01:51:48.136 --> 01:51:50.312
There were hundreds
of people there.

2716
01:51:50.312 --> 01:51:51.356
- There were a ton
of people there.

2717
01:51:51.356 --> 01:51:52.531
- Right.

2718
01:51:52.531 --> 01:51:53.445
- How can it be only her?

2719
01:51:53.445 --> 01:51:55.012
- Come on now.

2720
01:51:55.012 --> 01:51:56.535
The cops said they seen her

2721
01:51:56.535 --> 01:51:58.407
and she ran from them.

2722
01:51:58.407 --> 01:52:01.453
And why would she run
if she wasn't guilty?

2723
01:52:01.453 --> 01:52:04.282
- I could think of plenty
reasons why she would run.

2724
01:52:04.282 --> 01:52:05.806
One. she was scared.

2725
01:52:05.806 --> 01:52:07.372
- She was scared. she
could have been nervous.

2726
01:52:07.372 --> 01:52:09.157
- [Man] Wouldn't you
run if you saw a cop?

2727
01:52:09.157 --> 01:52:10.898
- Why is she scared and nervous

2728
01:52:10.898 --> 01:52:12.421
if she's not guilty?

2729
01:52:12.421 --> 01:52:14.162
- Ever met a cop
you could trust?

2730
01:52:14.162 --> 01:52:15.946
- There's not a
high level of trust

2731
01:52:15.946 --> 01:52:19.123
for police officers in
that community. right?

2732
01:52:19.123 --> 01:52:21.604
- Does she have any priors?

2733
01:52:21.604 --> 01:52:23.562
- Priors or no priors.
guilty is guilty.

2734
01:52:23.562 --> 01:52:25.477
There was a gun on the scene.

2735
01:52:25.477 --> 01:52:27.088
- Where's the evidence?

2736
01:52:27.088 --> 01:52:29.046
- Now I hear you.

2737
01:52:29.046 --> 01:52:30.221
But I also heard three cops

2738
01:52:30.221 --> 01:52:31.657
say the same exact thing.

2739
01:52:31.657 --> 01:52:33.137
- Three cops?

2740
01:52:33.137 --> 01:52:34.138
- Yeah. three.
- Were they male?

2741
01:52:34.138 --> 01:52:35.574
Were they female?

2742
01:52:35.574 --> 01:52:37.228
Were they biased?

2743
01:52:37.228 --> 01:52:39.230
Were there any witnesses?

2744
01:52:39.230 --> 01:52:41.102
- They say they've
seen Miss Porsha Garcia

2745
01:52:41.102 --> 01:52:42.973
with a gun in her hand.

2746
01:52:42.973 --> 01:52:45.062
And she ran from them.

2747
01:52:45.062 --> 01:52:47.543
Now coming from
where I come from.

2748
01:52:47.543 --> 01:52:51.677
a gun plus a run.
that equals guilty.

2749

- And coming from
where I come from.

2750
01:52:53.549 --> 01:52:55.681
you can't trust the cops.

2751

There's no evidence.
real evidence.

2752
01:52:57.901 --> 01:52:59.076
She didn't get
caught with the gun.

2753
01:52:59.076 --> 01:53:00.643
There's no real witness.

2754
01:53:00.643 --> 01:53:02.601
It's just three cops
saying the same thing.

2755
01:53:05.126 --> 01:53:06.649
- Look.

2756
01:53:06.649 --> 01:53:09.391
I think we just need
to keep track of

2757
01:53:09.391 --> 01:53:13.743
the information that was
presented for the case. right?

2758
01:53:13.743 --> 01:53:15.527
Let's not make any assumptions.

2759
01:53:15.527 --> 01:53:18.356
There's no gun. right?

No clear evidence
connecting Miss Garcia

2761
01:53:21.925 --> 01:53:24.798
with actually the crime. so

2762
01:53:24.798 --> 01:53:26.408
I say she's not guilty.

2763
01:53:26.408 --> 01:53:27.844
