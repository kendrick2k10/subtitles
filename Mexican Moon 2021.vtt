What brings you to law enforcement?

- Did two tours in Nam.

71
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.563
I survived and made it
through Ranger School.

72
00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.610
- Was that law enforcement?

73
00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:36.963
- Well. it.

Got my fair share of
trigger time in the bank.

79
00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:56.733
Used to being shot at.

80
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.670
- We're not at war. young man.

81
00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:02.720
- Well. maybe closer than you think. sir.

82
00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.960
- Pardon?

83
00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.783
- Them cartels. sir. they're
bringing the war to us.

84
00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.650
They come knocking. might
be good to have a fighter

85
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:11.503
on your force.

86
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.670
- This department doesn't need soldiers.

87
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:17.993
We need peace officers.

88
00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:21.650

in and out of combat.

feel like that would work well

101
00:12:38.505 --> 00:12:41.543
in a financial services.

102
00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.570

107
00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.370
- You don't have to call me sir.

108
00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:05.820

You're a skilled man.
just not in civilian life.

122
00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.260
Wouldn't it be best to re-enlist

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.350
and finish your professional
life in the military

124
00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:54.123

00:18:37.353 --> 00:18:38.186
What happened?

186
00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:41.483
- Only job in town and it dried up.

187
00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:45.440
- This whole town's drying up. kid.

188
00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:48.813
- Yeah.

189
00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:51.477
- Did I ever ask you your name?

190
00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:54.320
- No.

191
00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.153
- What is it?

192
00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.460
- Sonny.

193
00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:58.293
- That it?

194
00:18:59.558 --> 00:19:00.700
- Tripono.

195
00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:01.550
- What'd you say?

196
00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:04.483
- Tripono. it's Italian.

197
00:19:04.483 --> 00:19:05.316
- I know that.

198
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:07.460
You prior military?

199
00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:09.630
- Yeah.

200
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:10.463
- What outfit?

201
00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.963
- H Company. 75th Infantry.

202
00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:15.953
- Ranger?

203
00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:19.890
- Yeah.

204
00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:21.950
- Me too. Frank McFirboth.

205
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:25.353
- You prior military?

206
00:19:25.353 --> 00:19:27.913
- Made it through Ranger School. sniper.

207
00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.060
19 confirmed kills.

208
00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:32.683
Who knows how many overall.

209
00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.360
I don't wanna think about it.

210
00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:36.193
You?

211
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:39.893
- Try not to think about it.

212
00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:46.010
- I wake up at 3:00 AM.
same time every night.

213
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:50.370
I look in the darkness and
I wonder if all those men

214
00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:55.370
I closed down out there in the
shadows looking back at me.

215
00:19:58.090 --> 00:19:59.923
I wonder if they're coming for me.

216
00:20:02.904 --> 00:20:04.643
Or if they're waiting
for me to come to them.

217
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:11.057
- Frank. I try not to wonder.

218
00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:14.503
- Yeah.

219
00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.351
- You married?

220
00:20:19.351 --> 00:20:20.440
- Was.

221
00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.273
Had a son.

222
00:20:22.931 --> 00:20:25.200
Wife took him when I was overseas.

223
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.750
never saw either of them again.

224
00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:31.270
Didn't want our boy growing
up to be a bloody man.

225
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:32.970
I tried not to be a bad influence.

226
00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:37.350
- You ever try to find him?

227
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:40.433
- Oh yeah. spend nearly
the last 40 years trying.

228
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.783
She died not long after she left me.

229
00:20:44.924 --> 00:20:46.374
The boy ended up around here.

230
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.993
Actually why I moved out
West and bought this place.

231
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.850
Kept hoping he'd just come
walking through those doors

232
00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:55.700
one day and throw his arms around me.

233
00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:58.773
I'm just an old fool.

234
00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:06.550
- Yeah. ain't much
different back in the world.

235
00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:09.350
- Here they'll kill you with
poverty instead of bullets.

236
00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:12.483
- Ain't no jobs.

237
00:21:13.498 --> 00:21:14.331
- I know.

238
00:21:14.331 --> 00:21:16.460
- All I know how to do is fight.

239
00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:17.377
- So fight.

240
00:21:19.172 --> 00:21:21.922
(dramatic music)

241
00:21:30.294 --> 00:21:34.794

242
00:21:45.322 --> 00:21:48.239
♪ Lonely teardrops ♪

243
00:21:59.753 --> 00:22:02.503
(dramatic music)

244
00:22:04.363 --> 00:22:07.713
- Hey. old man. what you
keep lookin' at me for?

245
00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:13.408
This is a Texican bar. hombre.

246
00:22:13.408 --> 00:22:15.420
You're drippin' water all over the floor.

247
00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:17.270
Why don't you just swim on back home.

248
00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:34.150
Well. look. it's the lurch.

249
00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:35.143
You ride?

250
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:39.493
You look like a lurch.

251
00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.073
- It's time for you to leave.

252
00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.320
- You gonna make me?

253
00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:48.180
- Looks that way.

254
00:22:50.118 --> 00:22:50.951
- Make me.

255
00:23:01.031 --> 00:23:03.698
(fist pounding)

256
00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:12.980
- 20. 30. 35

257
00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:16.123
and your tip.

258
00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.983
Keep taking out the trash.

259
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:23.203
- Yeah. thanks.

260
00:23:24.865 --> 00:23:25.698
Bye.

261
00:23:25.698 --> 00:23:27.813
- [Frank] Hey. hold on.
Sonny. I'll walk out with ya.

262
00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:30.263
Nobody walks out alone.

263
00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.603
- [Sonny] Goodnight. Frank.

264
00:23:33.534 --> 00:23:36.284
(dramatic music)

265
00:23:58.039 --> 00:23:59.070
(gun fires)

266
00:23:59.070 --> 00:23:59.970
Get on the ground.

267
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:15.597
- You all right?

268
00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:22.340
- Here. point this pea shooter at him.

269
00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:23.960
Call the cops.

270
00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.510
- We don't allow weapons in the bar.

271
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:28.440
but once these drunk
hicks get to their trucks.

272
00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.320
they can grab anything.

273
00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.820
That's why no man walks alone.

274
00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:34.003
- Frank. I don't think
I wanna do this regular.

275
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.433
- Yeah.

276
00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:41.673
- Yeah.

277
00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.620
(dog barking)

278
00:24:52.688 --> 00:24:55.355
(hand knocking)

279
00:25:03.993 --> 00:25:04.826
Come in.

280
00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:11.583
Well. welcome to my palace.

281
00:25:22.447 --> 00:25:26.697
(man speaking in foreign language)

282
00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:35.833
- Keep it.

283
00:25:35.833 --> 00:25:37.590
The old man says you need
it more than he does.

284
00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:38.960
He'll be dead soon.

285
00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:39.863
We have far to go.

286
00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:41.993
- He say how far?

287
00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:44.900
(man speaking in foreign language)

288
00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:46.850
- The old man wishes to thank you. sir.

289
00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:50.010
- Just taking out the trash.

290
00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:51.580
- He's seen you before.

291
00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:52.430
You're a soldier.

292
00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:56.623
- Yeah. I was.

293
00:25:58.837 --> 00:26:00.487
- Are you still willing to fight?

294
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:02.900
- Depends on the fight.

295
00:26:04.276 --> 00:26:05.907
- There is no work for
soldiers in this town.

296
00:26:05.907 --> 00:26:07.560
The town is dying.

297
00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:08.860
You must be dying with it.

298
00:26:10.773 --> 00:26:11.723
- Yeah. I guess so.

299
00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:17.433
- He knows where $100.000 are buried.

300
00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:21.370
- Oh yeah. where. in the North Pole?

301
00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:29.423
- No. in the false grave 20
meters outside of cemetery.

302
00:26:33.979 --> 00:26:35.000
- The cemetery?

303
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.090
- No. on the other side.

304
00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:39.260
Only 100 meters from the Texas border.

305
00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:40.510
There is no American law.

306
00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:43.300
- What about Mexican law?

307
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.570
- No law. except the cartel.

308
00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:51.013
And the law man meets with
the skill. the soldier skill.

309
00:27:02.601 --> 00:27:04.950
- What's the American's name on the grave?

310
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:06.230
- John Portero.

311
00:27:10.387 --> 00:27:12.327
- How does he know all this?

312
00:27:12.327 --> 00:27:13.593
- 'Cause he buried it.

313
00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:17.240
- Aren't you afraid of
the cartel killing him

314
00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.440
for telling me all this?

315
00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:22.410
- He is ready to lose his
life to be free of them.

316
00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:24.253
Or he will just die of his cancer.

317
00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:29.283
Or you can kill them for him.

318
00:27:32.133 --> 00:27:33.133
- I ain't no killer.

319
00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:35.955
- Yes. you are.

320
00:27:35.955 --> 00:27:37.610
He sees your eyes.

321
00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:39.770
There are wolves and coyotes.

322
00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:40.930
Both are killers.

323
00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:43.138
One is a sneak and a trickster.

324
00:27:43.138 --> 00:27:44.940
and the other is a killer with honor.

325
00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:45.820
You're a wolf.

326
00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:47.770
He believes you can kill these coyotes.

327
00:28:03.063 --> 00:28:04.020
He has drawn you a map.

328
00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:05.820
He just buried the money last night.

329
00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:09.790
Every new moon they open up
the grave and count the money.

330
00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:13.010
You have 29 days before
they know the money is gone.

331
00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:15.033
They call each cycle a Mexican moon.

332
00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:17.900
- Then what happens?

333
00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:20.963
- They will find you and try to kill you.

334
00:28:29.572 --> 00:28:32.408
(dramatic music)

335
00:28:32.408 --> 00:28:35.190
He desires you to punish them.

336
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:36.253
- You punish me. kid.

337
00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:39.760
No thanks. amigo.

338
00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:42.083
Sorry.

339
00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:46.990
Good luck to you and the old man. though.

340
00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:49.190
- Look. the old man lives at the cemetery.

341
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:50.570
He's the caretaker.

342
00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:52.670
If you change your mind. come and see him.

343
00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:56.070
- What's his name?

344
00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:58.463
- Juan Pena.

345
00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:01.940
- It's a strong name.

346
00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.153
Tell him I'm sorry about his cancer.

347
00:29:06.979 --> 00:29:08.312
- I'll tell him.

348
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:21.084
(crickets chirping)

349
00:29:21.084 --> 00:29:23.751
(phone ringing)

350
00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:39.503
This is Sonny.

351
00:29:40.707 --> 00:29:42.507
- [Marge] It's your landlord. Marge.

352
00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:44.713
You're late on your rent.

353
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:47.060
You got it?

354
00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:48.673
- No. I don't have it.

355
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:52.060
- [Marge] Be that as it may.

356
00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:55.030
your lease agreement
stipulates delinquent payment-

357
00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:56.700
- I got laid off.

358
00:29:56.700 --> 00:30:00.840
- [Marge] Past for days
can result in eviction.

359
00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.433
If the rent's not in my office by morning.

360
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:06.333
we're changing the locks.

361
00:30:07.317 --> 00:30:08.150
- I understand.

362
00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.160
- [Marge] Anything left in your trailer.

363
00:30:14.981 --> 00:30:17.648
(phone ringing)

364
00:30:19.032 --> 00:30:20.210
- This is Sonny.

365
00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:22.460
- [Torry] Hello Mr. Tripono. this is Torry

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:25.193
How are you?

368
00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:27.493
Mr. Tripono?

369
00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.910
- Isn't a little late for
the bank to be callin'?

370
00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:32.780
- [Torry] I'm actually
with Verde Collections.

372
00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:35.173
- Right.

373
00:30:35.173 --> 00:30:37.250
- [Torry] It seems you are
behind on your truck payment.

374
00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:38.950
Are you able to make payments?

375
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:40.080
- No. I don't have it.

376
00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.720
- [Torry] I'm sorry to hear that.

377
00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:43.380
but this isn't your
first delinquent payment.

378
00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:44.965
- I got laid off.

379
00:30:44.965 --> 00:30:46.620
- [Torry] Oh. well. unfortunately we'll

380
00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:49.070
still have to take the
truck back in the morning.

381
00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:51.470
- No. I understand.

382
00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:56.225
- [Torry] We'll send someone
in the morning to retrieve it.

383
00:30:56.225 --> 00:30:57.490
Thanks for you time.

384
00:30:57.490 --> 00:30:59.161
Have a wonderful night.

385
00:30:59.161 --> 00:31:00.328
- Oh. you too.

386
00:31:21.555 --> 00:31:24.138
(somber music)

387
00:31:28.753 --> 00:31:31.586
(coyotes yipping)

388
00:33:23.195 --> 00:33:25.778
(somber music)

389
00:33:56.767 --> 00:33:59.684
(engine murmuring)

390
00:34:11.903 --> 00:34:12.736
- Hey!

391
00:34:19.255 --> 00:34:22.505
(church bells tolling)

392
00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:27.303
Where you headed. cowboy?

393
00:34:32.105 --> 00:34:34.210
You don't remember me?

394
00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:36.140
- Where's Prince Charming?

395
00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:37.040
- Jail.

396
00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:39.440
He got into another fight
that night with a cop.

397
00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:42.120
- You bail him out?

398
00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:45.900
- No. he's not my boyfriend.

399
00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:46.733
- I didn't ask.

400
00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:48.573
- You didn't have to.

401
00:34:52.022 --> 00:34:54.150
- Make it to your granddaddy's all right?

402
00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:54.983
- Yeah.

403
00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:57.230
So where are you headed?

404
00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:01.163
- Tin Alley RV's.

405
00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.153
- That's seven miles out.

406
00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:06.423
- Closer to six.

407
00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:08.373
- Come on.

408
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:14.450
Well. are you afraid of girls?

409
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:17.783
- Sometimes.

410
00:35:19.136 --> 00:35:20.493
- You don't have to be afraid of me.

411
00:35:27.105 --> 00:35:29.240
Why are you dressed like that?

412
00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:30.763
- [Sonny] It's my work clothes.

413
00:35:30.763 --> 00:35:32.620
I was looking for a job.

414
00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:33.970
- [Woman] Did you find one?

415
00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.650
- [Sonny] No.

416
00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:37.483
- [Woman] Sorry.

417
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:40.230
- [Sonny] I'll figure something out.

418
00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:48.910
- So is anyone home?

419
00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:52.870
- I'm not married.

420
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:53.793
- I didn't ask.

421
00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:56.290
- Didn't have to.

422
00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:00.650
- You're a soldier.

423
00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:02.469
- Why does everybody ask me that.

424
00:36:02.469 --> 00:36:04.552
- People ask the obvious.

425
00:36:08.168 --> 00:36:09.001
- Yeah.

426
00:36:10.137 --> 00:36:12.800
Well. thanks for the ride.

427
00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.467
- Mary. and you are?

428
00:36:17.012 --> 00:36:19.845
- Still trying to figure that out.

429
00:36:23.796 --> 00:36:24.985
Sonny.

430
00:36:24.985 --> 00:36:26.436
- Sonny?

431
00:36:26.436 --> 00:36:27.796
- Tripono.

432
00:36:27.796 --> 00:36:29.915
- Is that Italian?

433
00:36:29.915 --> 00:36:32.248
- People do ask the obvious.

434
00:36:33.953 --> 00:36:35.927
Thanks for the ride.

435
00:36:35.927 --> 00:36:36.760
- Yeah.

436
00:36:56.802 --> 00:36:59.385
(somber music)

437
00:38:53.731 --> 00:38:55.301
- What's that?

438
00:38:55.301 --> 00:38:56.585
- [Sonny] My stuff.

439
00:38:56.585 --> 00:38:57.850
- Don't it belong in your trailer?

440
00:38:57.850 --> 00:38:59.320
- [Sonny] What trailer?

441
00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:00.563
- Oh. I see.

442
00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:05.290
- [Sonny] Give me a beer. will ya. Frank?

443
00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:06.123
- No. sir.

444
00:39:07.071 --> 00:39:08.480
- [Sonny] Ain't this a bar?

445
00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:09.753
- Not for you it ain't.

446
00:39:10.702 --> 00:39:13.080
You gonna be another drunk. homeless vet

447
00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:14.780
and I ain't gonna let that happen.

448
00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:17.727
Here's what you gonna do.

449
00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:23.623
Take those keys and go
take a shower. you stink.

450
00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.580
You'll crash at my place tonight

451
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:30.180
and in the morning I'll drive
you to the VA in El Paso.

452
00:39:31.027 --> 00:39:34.260
They'll set you up with
their job placement service.

453
00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:36.060
- [Sonny] Frank. you got a second?

454
00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:38.993
- I got 120 of 'em and then
I gotta get back to work.

455
00:39:47.213 --> 00:39:49.490
(acoustic guitar music)

456
00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:50.540
And you believed him?

457
00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:53.600
- Yeah. it checked out.

458
00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:57.710
- I don't like it.

459
00:40:00.684 --> 00:40:02.230
- What do you mean?

460
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:03.740
- Three rules of combat.

461
00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:07.683
Know your enemy. know yourself
and remove uncertainty.

462
00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:12.930
- Yeah. and strike with
overwhelming force.

463
00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:15.357
- Oh. yeah. I forgot that one.

464
00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:19.590
- So how would you do it?

465
00:40:22.347 --> 00:40:23.353
- I just I wouldn't.

466
00:40:26.396 --> 00:40:28.947
- Yeah. but if you was to.

467
00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.500
- Well. we're in neutral territory. right?

468
00:40:35.515 --> 00:40:37.160
- Well. it ain't Texas.

469
00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:38.640
Mexican government don't patrol it none.

470
00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:41.443
so yeah that's neutral enough.

471
00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:46.140
- I'd load up a batch of
ammo with them supplies

472
00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:48.763
you said your boss gave
you when you got laid off.

473
00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:52.030
Load up some rifle ammo.

474
00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:53.370
If you use those components.

475
00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:55.020
there're be no tracing 'em back to you

476
00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:57.253
when the cartels start scratchin' around.

477
00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:59.253
And get a map.

478
00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:02.140
- Gotta a map.

479
00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:05.780
- I mean real one from the
Army Corps of Engineers.

480
00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:08.080
Learn every gopher and snake hole

481
00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:10.620
within a one mile radius of that grave

482
00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:13.173
so you can fight that
area blind if you have to.

483
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:16.640
- Ain't gonna be no fight.

484
00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.140
- Get ready to fight anyway

485
00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:19.683
and get ready to be tracked.

486
00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:22.693
- Yeah.

487
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.610
- I mean tracked to the ends of the earth.

488
00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:28.913
You take that money. they'll kill ya.

489
00:41:34.901 --> 00:41:36.465
- They'll try.

490
00:41:36.465 --> 00:41:38.882
- And there's something else.

491
00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:41.513
You really gonna kill for money?

492
00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:48.890
- Well. like I said. there
ain't gonna be no killin'.

493
00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:52.640
- There's gonna be killin'.

494
00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:56.060
They'll keep sendin' men
after you like in Nam. Sonny.

495
00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:59.273
You cut one head off and two
more will grow right back.

496
00:42:00.226 --> 00:42:02.867
And there's gonna be
more of them than you.

497
00:42:02.867 --> 00:42:03.753
I don't like it.

498
00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:05.827
- Yeah. you said that.

499
00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.160
- Well. I'm saying it again.

500
00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.343
Sonny. you're a soldier. not a mercenary.

501
00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:14.140
You really gonna kill for money.

502
00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:15.633
even if they is bums?

503
00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:18.690
You ain't that kind of killer. kid.

504
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:22.400
And listen. you think
working here is dangerous.

505
00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:24.823
wait till you steal honey
from an army of bees.

506
00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:27.660
Yeah. I said steal.

507
00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:29.660
What makes stealing
this money any different

508
00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:31.333
than riskin' workin' here?

509
00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:36.620
- Here I'm riskin' my
neck for 50 bucks a night.

510
00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:42.227
This. this $100.000.

511
00:42:42.227 --> 00:42:43.823
I only gotta do it once.

512
00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:47.933
- Yeah. well. you're a
soldier. not a killer.

513
00:42:47.933 --> 00:42:49.630
- What's the difference?

514
00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:53.197
- Honor and your 120 seconds are up.

515
00:42:54.084 --> 00:42:56.667
Now go get yourself cleaned up.

516
00:43:01.488 --> 00:43:04.238
(dramatic music)

517
00:43:25.483 --> 00:43:29.900
(police radio talking in background)

518
00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:36.840
- Dog tags. huh?

519
00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:39.083
You a soldier?

520
00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:45.083
Sonny Tipono.

521
00:43:47.830 --> 00:43:48.793
That Italian?

522
00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:59.170
Hey. you're the soldier
that wanted to be a deputy.

523
00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:00.003
Sure.

524
00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:05.330
That's a good thing we didn't hire you.

525
00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:07.493
Get up.

526
00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:16.273
Keep it up. kid.

527
00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:20.453
I'm real good friends
with the medical examiner.

528
00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:25.073
I just sent him a customer last
month. as a matter of fact.

529
00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:27.663
He's open 24 hours.

530
00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:34.033
Get up.

531
00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:35.903
Get up!

532
00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:45.980
Public intox is three days
in the clink. soldier.

533
00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:48.383
Drunk and disorderly
is seven. plus a fine.

534
00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:52.370
which I'm guessin' you can't pay.

535
00:44:54.286 --> 00:44:57.036
(dramatic music)

536
00:45:05.245 --> 00:45:07.031
You're a dead man.

537
00:45:07.031 --> 00:45:10.448
- [Sonny] So are you if try to follow me.

538
00:45:12.506 --> 00:45:15.423
(mysterious music)

539
00:46:06.079 --> 00:46:10.630
(speaking in foreign language)

540
00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:13.963
(acoustic guitar music)

541
00:46:14.958 --> 00:46:17.395
Why'd you act like you
didn't speak no English?

542
00:46:17.395 --> 00:46:19.978
(man laughing)

543
00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:24.673
- Didn't know how far I could trust you.

544
00:46:26.290 --> 00:46:27.140
- What about now?

545
00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:29.623
- Do I have a choice?

546
00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:34.983
- Guess you don't have
as much of a choice now.

547
00:46:36.374 --> 00:46:39.313
(speaking in foreign language)
With a deputy back in town.

548
00:46:44.048 --> 00:46:47.140
(man speaking in foreign language)

549
00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:49.193
Nah. but he ain't too fond of me.

550
00:46:50.410 --> 00:46:52.530
I'll shoot first next time. comprende?

551
00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:55.147
- Question is. do you understand?

552
00:46:59.542 --> 00:47:03.427
- I understand nothing since
I came back to the world.

553
00:47:03.427 --> 00:47:06.673
They took my truck. trailer. job.

554
00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:09.153
- Who took them?

555
00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:12.497
- Civilized world. I guess.

556
00:47:12.497 --> 00:47:14.570
People want soldiers when
there's fighting to be done.

557
00:47:14.570 --> 00:47:17.040
but after the war's over.
they don't want to take them

558
00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:18.750
into their houses.

559
00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:19.583
- Yeah.

560
00:47:21.194 --> 00:47:23.494
You're a man between two
worlds. just like me.

561
00:47:24.963 --> 00:47:27.750
(man coughing)

562
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:32.750
Look. 100 yards that way is
Texas and here we are in Mexico.

563
00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:40.490
But this is not Mexico. man.

564
00:47:41.809 --> 00:47:43.790
(speaking in foreign language)

565
00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:44.743
Border country.

566
00:47:46.310 --> 00:47:51.310
Look. I speak Spanish. I'm not Mexican.

567
00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:54.600
Speak English and I'm not even American.

568
00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:58.233
I have no home but this cemetery.

569
00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:02.460
My companions are already dead.

570
00:48:03.617 --> 00:48:06.200
(man coughing)

571
00:48:08.073 --> 00:48:09.160
I will join soon.

572
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:25.940
But you know what. amigo?

573
00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:29.450
I think you're wrong about who
took those things from you.

574
00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:32.253
Man. it wasn't society.

575
00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:38.310
No. it was the cartel. those narcos. man.

576
00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:46.713
They are like the cancer in my stomach.

577
00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:50.053
Strangled was a life.

578
00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:56.663
And they took my wife. my children.

579
00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:01.613
My money and my dignity.

580
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:06.610
They leave me here just
to bury their money

581
00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:07.963
and their secrets.

582
00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:12.253
And their dead.

583
00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:20.913
Ah. yeah. that's my granddaughter.

584
00:49:22.530 --> 00:49:25.163
Thank God they still don't know about her.

585
00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:31.020
- I helped her out back in town
and she returned the favor.

586
00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:32.650
- Yeah. she told me.

587
00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:35.503
She stayed with me that
night when you saved her.

588
00:49:38.550 --> 00:49:39.420
You know what?

589
00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:40.870
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

590
00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:43.633
- I didn't ask.

591
00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:46.800
- You didn't have to.

592
00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:49.160
I can see it in your eyes. man.

593
00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:51.023
The way you look at that photograph.

594
00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:53.563
and the same thing with her.

595
00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:56.173
the way she talks about you.

596
00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:59.523
- Yeah. well. one crisis at a time.

597
00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:04.333
- Like $100.000?

598
00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:09.711
- Let's do it. amigo.

599
00:50:09.711 --> 00:50:12.294
(man coughing)

600
00:50:13.730 --> 00:50:14.563
- Okay.

601
00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:18.293
I'm too sick to help you. man.

602
00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:22.783
If you're gonna do this. you're
gonna have to do it alone.

603
00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:25.760
- Been alone all my life.

604
00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:32.883
- Well. you might end up
with a guilty conscience.

605
00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:38.190
- Already got a guilty conscience.

606
00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:40.147
Might as well have $100.000.

607
00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:43.967
- Then (speaking in foreign language).

608
00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:52.500
I might not make it through the night.

609
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:57.207
but I wish you well.

610
00:50:57.207 --> 00:50:58.607
- See you on the other side.

611
00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:04.710
- You mean on the other side of the border

612
00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:06.663
or after death?

613
00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:10.400
- Whichever comes first.

614
00:51:12.063 --> 00:51:12.896
Adios.

615
00:51:18.877 --> 00:51:19.710

618
00:52:32.350 --> 00:52:35.870
In the grave. there are two containers.

619
00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:38.550
One has the money.

620
00:52:38.550 --> 00:52:40.330
- [Sonny] What's in the other one?

621
00:52:40.330 --> 00:52:44.210
- [Man] Like I said. there's secrets.

622
00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:48.560
You must not open it
under any circumstance.

623
00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:51.440
If you see it. bury it immediately

624
00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:53.417
or you're gonna be another dead gringo.

Want some coffee?

728
01:14:30.030 --> 01:14:30.863
- Sure.

729
01:14:49.511 --> 01:14:50.761
So what's next?

730
01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.020
- We go back to the start.

731
01:14:56.970 --> 01:14:58.391
- Meaning what?

732
01:14:58.391 --> 01:14:59.610
- Start of the trouble.

733
01:14:59.610 --> 01:15:01.210
The cartel money.

734
01:15:01.210 --> 01:15:02.043
Where is it?

735
01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:04.910
- Somewhere safe.

736
01:15:06.770 --> 01:15:07.820
- You don't trust me.

737
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:09.913
- Gotta earn trust.

738
01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:13.223
- Okay. well. we're earn it together.

739
01:15:15.550 --> 01:15:17.060
- How we gonna do that?

740
01:15:18.290 --> 01:15:19.340
- I'm going with you.

741
01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:21.553
- Where?

742
01:15:22.859 --> 01:15:24.823
- We gotta take the
money back to the cartel.

743
01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:27.950
- You're serious.

744
01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:29.430
- Very.

745
01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:30.930
- They shoot us full of holes.

746
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:35.980
Besides. I don't even got
my rifle. got it stashed.

747
01:15:40.341 --> 01:15:41.383
Wanna show you something.

748
01:15:46.884 --> 01:15:51.170
- Here. so here's the grave
where the money goes in.

749
01:15:51.170 --> 01:15:52.003
- I remember.

750
01:15:53.150 --> 01:15:54.573
- Can you find it in the dark?

751
01:15:55.949 --> 01:15:56.849
- We got the moon.

752
01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:00.570
- Good. because you'll
need to go in by foot.

753
01:16:00.570 --> 01:16:01.923
No trucks. no lights.

754
01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.130
- Where are you gonna be?

755
01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:06.750
- Right here.

756
01:16:06.750 --> 01:16:08.060
We're gonna pick you up.

757
01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:10.610
Bury the money fast and
shallow then book it

758
01:16:10.610 --> 01:16:13.619
right up into this side
road by the cemetery.

759
01:16:13.619 --> 01:16:15.313
I'll be waiting for you.

760
01:16:18.890 --> 01:16:19.723
- You sure?

761
01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:24.033
- Why won't you trust me?

762
01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:29.183
- I've known a lot of women.

763
01:16:30.472 --> 01:16:31.722
- None like me.

764
01:16:33.112 --> 01:16:34.570
- Okay.

765
01:16:34.570 --> 01:16:39.163
So I return the money.
you pick me up. then what?

766
01:16:41.404 --> 01:16:44.778
- I'll have word sent out to
the cartels it's been returned.

767
01:16:44.778 --> 01:16:45.611
- How?

768
01:16:46.990 --> 01:16:47.940
- I have a contact.

769
01:16:51.950 --> 01:16:52.783
- Who?

770
01:16:54.926 --> 01:16:56.430
- I can't tell you right now.

771
01:16:56.430 --> 01:16:58.883
You just. you have to trust me.

772
01:17:02.190 --> 01:17:03.690
- I don't like it.

773
01:17:04.770 --> 01:17:06.070
- What choice do you have?

774
01:17:07.190 --> 01:17:09.140
- Your grandfather said the same thing.

775
01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:11.640
- He's right.

776
01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:13.133
Do you have any other choice?

777
01:17:15.570 --> 01:17:18.253
- I know where the money is. you don't.

778
01:17:19.090 --> 01:17:20.773
I could take it and disappear.

779
01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:26.070
No law says I gotta follow
you back into a snake hole

780
01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:27.220
I'm already cleared of.

781
01:17:30.244 --> 01:17:33.110
- There's plenty of laws.

782
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:33.943
- Like what?

783
01:17:35.175 --> 01:17:38.510
- The law you broke when you
pulled a gun on that deputy.

784
01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:41.113
The law you broke when
you stole that money.

785
01:17:43.124 --> 01:17:44.423
And the law you broke.

786
01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:47.770
- Killing that boy.

787
01:17:49.230 --> 01:17:50.130
- I didn't say it.

788
01:17:51.815 --> 01:17:52.865
- You didn't have to.

789
01:17:54.910 --> 01:17:57.913
- Look. I can help you with all that too.

790
01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:01.520
You just gotta trust me.

791
01:18:06.170 --> 01:18:07.320
- Can I use your truck?

792
01:18:08.434 --> 01:18:09.267
- Yeah.

793
01:18:19.927 --> 01:18:23.260
(acoustic guitar music)

794
01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:33.273
So. how long will it take
you to get the money?

795
01:18:34.260 --> 01:18:35.573
- Hour. give or take.

796
01:18:36.490 --> 01:18:38.193
- Give. don't take.

797
01:18:39.470 --> 01:18:42.750
Okay. so it's gonna be 10
minutes to cross the border

798
01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:44.483
and another five to the cemetery.

799
01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:51.933
Hey.

800
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:55.217
I'll be waiting for you.

801
01:18:56.107 --> 01:18:57.107
- We'll see.

802
01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:04.170
- I'm sending you off in my
truck to go get the money.

803
01:19:05.370 --> 01:19:08.113
You could take the
briefcase and disappear.

804
01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:12.313
but you said you gotta earn trust.

805
01:19:14.937 --> 01:19:17.354
so we're earning it together.

806
01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:08.863
- Don't bother.

807
01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:13.053
Drop it.

808
01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:24.273
You can turn.

809
01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:31.253
- So finish it.

810
01:21:33.009 --> 01:21:34.609
- I was meant to take you alive.

811
01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:39.380
- It's considerate of you.

812
01:21:40.470 --> 01:21:44.423
- You deserve a soldier's
death. not an assassin's.

813
01:21:49.810 --> 01:21:51.010
- What's the difference?

814
01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:54.953
- Soldiers get to fight back.

815
01:21:58.920 --> 01:21:59.753
- Dead is dead.

816
01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:03.730
- It's about how you're remembered.

817
01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:08.330
- How are you gonna be remembered?

818
01:22:11.468 --> 01:22:14.853
- Canu. assassin. that's what I am.

819
01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:20.770
- So what's next?

820
01:22:23.230 --> 01:22:26.720
- The old man's granddaughter's
waiting for you up the road.

821
01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:30.283
After that. a very important
person's coming to see you.

822
01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:36.450
- Only one thing I don't understand.

823
01:22:36.450 --> 01:22:37.283
- What's that?

824
01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:40.883
- Where'd you learn to
speak such good English?

825
01:22:40.883 --> 01:22:42.650
- I'm from El Paso.

826
01:22:42.650 --> 01:22:43.600
You shouldn't stay.

827
01:22:51.968 --> 01:22:54.500
Walk on up to her like you planned.

828
01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:55.750
I'll head in from behind.

829
01:22:59.912 --> 01:23:04.245
You know. if you run or try
anything. I'll kill her.

830
01:23:08.857 --> 01:23:09.690
- I know.

831
01:23:25.383 --> 01:23:26.216
- Are you okay?

832
01:23:26.216 --> 01:23:27.049
- [Sonny] I'm fine.

833
01:23:27.049 --> 01:23:28.003
Get back.

834
01:23:28.003 --> 01:23:31.140
- A very dangerous person
will be here shortly.

835
01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:33.593
He will kill you. your boyfriend.

836
01:23:34.691 --> 01:23:36.341
and me if I don't kill you first.

837
01:23:39.318 --> 01:23:41.410
- [Sonny] Or?

838
01:23:41.410 --> 01:23:46.410
- Or kill me. take the keys. keep running.

839
01:23:48.030 --> 01:23:50.093
At least you'll have your fighting chance.

840
01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:52.717
Soldier's chance.

841
01:23:55.517 --> 01:23:58.267
(dramatic music)

842
01:24:42.616 --> 01:24:44.949
(gun fires)

843
01:25:00.465 --> 01:25:03.048
(somber music)

844
01:25:23.799 --> 01:25:26.382
(man groaning)

845
01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:48.693
- Sonny.

846
01:25:58.063 --> 01:26:01.063
(adventurous music)

847
01:26:40.990 --> 01:26:43.073
- Drop the weapon. Sonny.

848
01:26:45.729 --> 01:26:46.729
We know who you are.

849
01:26:54.260 --> 01:26:55.093
- Toss it.

850
01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:12.293
So now what?

851
01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:15.203
- Now we talk.

852
01:27:18.540 --> 01:27:19.483
Without guns.

853
01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:34.033
She's fine. my man's got her.

854
01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:38.223
Where's the money?

855
01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:49.580
This caveman thing
isn't gonna work. Sonny.

856
01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:52.863
Believe me. I'm the only friend you've got

857
01:27:52.863 --> 01:27:54.507
that can straighten this out.

858
01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:56.740
Now where's the money?

859
01:28:03.930 --> 01:28:05.180
- It's back in the grave.

860
01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:08.353
- All right.

861
01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:10.550
We need to have a conversation

862
01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:12.343
that we can't have back in Texas.

863
01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:15.330
It's not safe here.

864
01:28:15.330 --> 01:28:17.980
You need to come with me
back to the old man's shack.

865
01:28:19.610 --> 01:28:20.713
He's been buried.

866
01:28:21.670 --> 01:28:23.033
Our team has cleared it.

867
01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:28.660
Prove that you can trust me.

868
01:28:29.730 --> 01:28:31.450
I'm gonna let you hold onto that 45

869
01:28:31.450 --> 01:28:32.750
you got in your waistband.

870
01:28:38.350 --> 01:28:39.803
I know I can trust you.

871
01:28:41.780 --> 01:28:44.417
You gotta believe that
you can trust me. Sonny.

872
01:29:03.690 --> 01:29:06.190
(fan buzzing)

873
01:29:23.420 --> 01:29:24.313
Stick of gum?

874
01:29:27.130 --> 01:29:28.253
I just quit smoking.

875
01:29:29.730 --> 01:29:31.163
Wife says I'm a beast.

876
01:29:34.430 --> 01:29:36.053
Well. it may not seem like it.

877
01:29:39.100 --> 01:29:40.323
today's your luck day.

878
01:29:42.670 --> 01:29:43.710
Maybe I should say

879
01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:47.430
you're a very lucky man. Mr. Tripono.

880
01:29:48.810 --> 01:29:50.073
Mary. she.

881
01:29:53.890 --> 01:29:55.493
sure you don't wanna stick of gum?

882
01:29:56.650 --> 01:29:57.483
- No.

883
01:29:59.857 --> 01:30:00.853
- All right.

884
01:30:03.810 --> 01:30:06.580
Mary and her grandfather
were in union position

885
01:30:06.580 --> 01:30:08.733
to help us fight the cartels. Mr. Tripono.

886
01:30:10.044 --> 01:30:12.230
Here grandfather in his cemetery

887
01:30:12.230 --> 01:30:15.400
were a wealth of information
in just about every aspect

888
01:30:16.420 --> 01:30:18.693
on the cartel's operation in this area.

889
01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:25.170
Buried money. buried enemies.

890
01:30:25.170 --> 01:30:28.573
Maps. weapons and cached ammo.

891
01:30:30.790 --> 01:30:31.840
It's the mother lode.

892
01:30:33.110 --> 01:30:35.910
She's been helping us build
our case for over a year.

893
01:30:35.910 --> 01:30:38.300
In exchange. we offered her grandfather

894
01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:39.713
what protection we could.

895
01:30:50.670 --> 01:30:53.540
What happened tonight never happened.

896
01:30:53.540 --> 01:30:54.740
if you catch my meaning.

897
01:30:55.855 --> 01:30:57.705
A few hundred yards north into Texas.

898
01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:00.470
our story has a different ending.

899
01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:05.763
As it stands. I should have
never arrested you where I did.

900
01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:10.320
- Didn't know you arrested me.

901
01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:14.463
- The boy that was killed.

902
01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:17.713
now that was in Texas.

903
01:31:19.010 --> 01:31:22.750
Perhaps boy is too gentle of a word

904
01:31:22.750 --> 01:31:26.220
'cause we traced at least
nine murders back to him.

905
01:31:26.220 --> 01:31:28.853
all of which occurred
south of the magical river.

906
01:31:30.310 --> 01:31:31.653
so he's not our problem.

907
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:33.883
Who killed him?

908
01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:36.543
Doesn't matter.

909
01:31:37.900 --> 01:31:40.593
Drug deal gone bad. that's
what our reports say.

910
01:31:42.958 --> 01:31:44.720
And that man you killed tonight

911
01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:46.963
was responsible for that boy's death.

912
01:31:47.860 --> 01:31:51.163
He knew that you would
mistake that boy for himself.

913
01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:54.723
We knew that he'd set it up.

914
01:31:57.190 --> 01:31:59.940
But if we'd have interfered.
we'd have blown our cover.

915
01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:03.515
His name is

916
01:32:03.515 --> 01:32:05.430
(laughing)

917
01:32:05.430 --> 01:32:10.430
his name was John Torres.
DEA Special Agent.

918
01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:13.393
He went rogue.

919
01:32:14.580 --> 01:32:17.750
We had two options. build
a case and arrest him.

920
01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:19.860
which would be impossible

921
01:32:20.830 --> 01:32:25.100
'cause he could vanish
into Mexico like a ghost.

922
01:32:25.100 --> 01:32:28.453
or we could put a hit out
on him and have him removed.

923
01:32:29.940 --> 01:32:31.393
unofficially. of course.

924
01:32:33.310 --> 01:32:34.760
And that's where you came in.

925
01:32:47.090 --> 01:32:50.623
This. this is you. Sonny.

926
01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:54.863
Military record. personal history.

927
01:32:57.540 --> 01:33:00.463
They say Uncle Sam doesn't
file on every person.

928
01:33:01.870 --> 01:33:02.803
but he does.

929
01:33:07.580 --> 01:33:12.580
We knew Agent Torres was
obsessed with honor and combat.

930
01:33:12.730 --> 01:33:14.123
We knew he'd challenge you.

931
01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:19.323
Based on your war record.
we bet on you to win.

932
01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:24.783
Let me tell you why you're a
very luck man. Mr. Tripono.

933
01:33:29.253 --> 01:33:32.693
The DEA is offering a $50.000 reward.

934
01:33:32.693 --> 01:33:34.233
that money you brought back.

935
01:33:35.970 --> 01:33:38.830
What's more. Sonny
Tripono dies in that fight

936
01:33:38.830 --> 01:33:40.163
across the border tonight.

937
01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:43.720
He's buried in that cemetery

938
01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:45.943
with all those other cartel secrets.

939
01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.157
That is you.

940
01:33:55.877 --> 01:33:58.080
You keep shut about
everything I shared tonight.

941
01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:03.030
cooperate with us completely.
help us construct our case

942
01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:04.293
against the cartel.

943
01:34:08.426 --> 01:34:09.259
in this envelope

944
01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:13.473
is your new life.

945
01:34:14.490 --> 01:34:17.880
Birth certificate. driver's license.

946
01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:21.093
Social Security card. everything.

947
01:34:25.410 --> 01:34:27.453
Including a clean record.

948
01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:32.420
And we'll also take care
of that little local thing

949
01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:33.270
you had going on.

950
01:34:36.670 --> 01:34:38.360
Also. if you just happen to be married.

951
01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:41.640
that would. well. that'd
make our paperwork

952
01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:42.593
that much easier.

953
01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:50.600
We'll give you two
minutes to talk about it.

954
01:34:56.533 --> 01:34:59.200
(calming music)

955
01:35:03.770 --> 01:35:05.403
- So is this what you couldn't tell me?

956
01:35:11.710 --> 01:35:12.910
Should have trusted you.

957
01:35:14.020 --> 01:35:14.893
- Just start now.

958
01:35:16.970 --> 01:35:18.020
- So what do you say?

959
01:35:21.368 --> 01:35:22.451
- About what?

960
01:35:23.923 --> 01:35:26.283
- Said the paperwork would
be easier if we were married.

961
01:35:27.271 --> 01:35:28.909
- If you were married.

962
01:35:28.909 --> 01:35:32.046
He didn't say anything about me.

963
01:35:32.046 --> 01:35:34.129
- Who else would I marry?

964
01:35:40.300 --> 01:35:41.740
Isn't is every girl's
dream to get proposed to

965
01:35:41.740 --> 01:35:43.690
in a Mexican cemetery after a shooting?

966
01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:47.140
- I don't know. Sonny.

967
01:35:48.910 --> 01:35:50.320
You don't want me.

968
01:35:51.438 --> 01:35:54.271
Find yourself a nice Italian girl.

969
01:35:55.853 --> 01:35:56.686
- I want you.

970
01:36:01.583 --> 01:36:03.000
- I want you too.

971
01:36:04.222 --> 01:36:06.972
(dramatic music)

972
01:36:37.645 --> 01:36:40.887
(grill sizzling)

973
01:36:40.887 --> 01:36:42.037
- [Sonny] Howdy. Frank.

974
01:36:44.970 --> 01:36:47.173
- You look like a banker on holiday.

975
01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:50.840
Thought they turned you down
for that job at the bank.

976
01:36:52.470 --> 01:36:53.320
Where's your hat?

977
01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.720
- Wife didn't like it.

978
01:36:57.720 --> 01:36:58.553
- Wife?

979
01:37:01.550 --> 01:37:02.500
- Just got married.

980
01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:05.090
- Congratulations.

981
01:37:05.090 --> 01:37:07.313
Mailman must of lost my invitation.

982
01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:11.860
- It's complicated.

983
01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:14.870
- Yeah. money tends to complicate things.

984
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:16.353
Told you not to take it.

985
01:37:23.147 --> 01:37:24.520
- Well. it's all over now.

986
01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:25.353
Gave it back.

987
01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:28.923
- So that's it?

988
01:37:31.548 --> 01:37:32.448
- Yeah. that's it.

989
01:37:33.870 --> 01:37:36.073
- But now you gotta leave town.

990
01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:39.873
- Yeah.

991
01:37:42.370 --> 01:37:43.313
- I understand.

992
01:37:52.740 --> 01:37:54.373
- Thanks for all you done for me.

993
01:37:57.280 --> 01:37:58.830
- Wish it could have been more.

994
01:38:03.630 --> 01:38:05.453
- Not more. just sooner.

995
01:38:07.610 --> 01:38:08.783
- You ain't no orphan.

996
01:38:10.130 --> 01:38:14.730
Tripono. it's Italian as far as we knew.

997
01:38:14.730 --> 01:38:16.533
Guess you already figured that out.

998
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:19.503
It's got no dishonor associated with it

999
01:38:19.503 --> 01:38:20.813
that I'm aware of.

1000
01:38:25.300 --> 01:38:27.000
- Had to change it.

1001
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.473
- Yeah. well it's still yours.

1002
01:38:33.970 --> 01:38:35.033
Ain't life a thing.

1003
01:38:36.130 --> 01:38:38.473
Find you just in time to give you up.

1004
01:38:46.810 --> 01:38:49.273
- Yeah. well. next time
we'll get it right.
