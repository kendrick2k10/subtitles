what actually happened

we had a couple of known serious
sex offenders and suspects.

358

uh. so myself and a team.
we quickly went...

359

..visited a couple of houses.

We seized some clothing from
a couple of addresses.

361
00:17:29.833 --> 00:17:31.553
And then we set up. at 10am.

362
00:17:31.633 --> 00:17:35.193

in Skye Road.

that had come in.

that had noticed the car

371

the two other sightings

another sighting

about to murder Natalie Russell.

to ring police.

at the crime scene.

that your car had been mentioned

653
00:29:28.713 --> 00:29:31.873

parked there.

from his address and...

675
00:30:14.993 --> 00:30:16.953
O'LOUGHLIN: He asked
what my thoughts were

676
00:30:17.033 --> 00:30:18.073
about the murders.

677
00:30:18.153 --> 00:30:19.953
And I said.
"Look. I'm not involved

678
00:30:20.033 --> 00:30:21.553
"in the investigation at all.

679
00:30:21.633 --> 00:30:23.873
"I've got no idea
what evidence they have.

680
00:30:23.953 --> 00:30:24.993
"what they're doing."

681
00:30:25.073 --> 00:30:27.513
um. along those sort of lines.

682
00:30:27.593 --> 00:30:31.633

683
00:30:31.713 --> 00:30:33.793
"Whoever's committing
these crimes

684
00:30:33.873 --> 00:30:36.873
"is influenced by a demon.

685
00:30:36.953 --> 00:30:38.153
"They're pure evil."

686
00:30:38.233 --> 00:30:42.393
And...and that caused him
to stop and think

687
00:30:42.473 --> 00:30:45.593
and say.
"I used to go to church."

688
00:30:45.673 --> 00:30:49.033
And I said.
"Oh. OK. Which church?"

689
00:30:49.113 --> 00:30:50.673
And he said. "Seaford."

690
00:30:50.753 --> 00:30:52.673
I said. "Who's the pastor?"

691
00:30:52.753 --> 00:30:55.153
He said.
"Pastor Peter Nicholls."

692
00:30:55.233 --> 00:30:58.833
And I was a bit shocked

693
00:30:58.913 --> 00:31:01.393
because it was just
a coincidence

694
00:31:01.473 --> 00:31:04.553
or a set of unusual facts

695
00:31:04.633 --> 00:31:08.273

00:31:08.353 --> 00:31:10.993

698
00:31:13.113 --> 00:31:14.873

your personal. um. details.

in my mind.

702

on your fingers.

put your hands...

708
00:31:34.393 --> 00:31:35.953
..flat on the desk here

709
00:31:36.033 --> 00:31:36.993

710

Just right up here.

711
00:31:41.673 --> 00:31:46.313

and every news bulletin

712
00:31:46.393 --> 00:31:48.713
led with. um.

713
00:31:48.793 --> 00:31:50.753

on the loose."

714
00:31:50.833 --> 00:31:52.753

a sense of importance

715
00:31:52.833 --> 00:31:54.633

he was the subject

was talking about

sort of edge.

around with some wires

that's a fairly deep...

873
00:38:33.673 --> 00:38:35.193
Well. why did you indicate
that area?

874
00:38:35.273 --> 00:38:36.993
I was just pointing
to that area. that's all.

875
00:38:37.073 --> 00:38:39.073
Well. why did you point
to that area?

876
00:38:40.913 --> 00:38:42.673
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
I don't know. Just...

877
00:38:42.753 --> 00:38:45.393
SILVESTER: Serial killers.
police and psychologists say.

878
00:38:45.473 --> 00:38:46.873
travel in their own orbit.

879
00:38:46.953 --> 00:38:48.353
What else do you know about it?

880
00:38:48.433 --> 00:38:51.073
What motivates them
varies from case to case.

881
00:38:51.153 --> 00:38:54.273
But what they share
is a lack of remorse.

882
00:38:54.353 --> 00:38:55.953
SILVESTER: How do you do that?

883
00:38:56.033 --> 00:38:58.033
Um. you've seen...

884
00:38:58.873 --> 00:39:00.273
..the bodies of the victims.

885
00:39:00.353 --> 00:39:02.753
You've seen the extreme trauma

886
00:39:02.833 --> 00:39:04.593
of the relatives.

887
00:39:04.673 --> 00:39:07.393
And you have this person telling
you these things matter-of-fact

888
00:39:07.473 --> 00:39:08.513
and you can't...

889
00:39:08.593 --> 00:39:10.233
Do you feel any emotion or...

890
00:39:10.313 --> 00:39:14.833
Um. the...the only emotion
that I feel

891
00:39:14.913 --> 00:39:18.873
is that the endgame
is the only thing that matters.

892
00:39:18.953 --> 00:39:22.793
Getting this guy to court.
getting him convicted.

893
00:39:22.873 --> 00:39:24.353
getting him off the streets

894
00:39:24.433 --> 00:39:27.233
is the only goal we have.

895
00:39:27.313 --> 00:39:29.473
Just...Mr Wilson asked you

896
00:39:29.553 --> 00:39:31.073
before just in relation
to the injuries

897
00:39:31.153 --> 00:39:34.873
and you...you mentioned
some injuries on Debbie Fream.

898
00:39:34.953 --> 00:39:35.913
-Is that correct?
-Mmm.

899
00:39:35.993 --> 00:39:37.873
-That you read in the paper?
-Yeah.

900
00:39:37.953 --> 00:39:39.553
What other injuries
did you read about.

901
00:39:39.633 --> 00:39:41.233
apart from the multiple
stab wounds?

902
00:39:41.313 --> 00:39:42.273
That was all.

903
00:39:42.353 --> 00:39:44.833
If we were to blow
that investigation

904
00:39:44.913 --> 00:39:46.513
because we felt frustrated

905
00:39:46.593 --> 00:39:50.073
or did something that. you
know...that would jeopardise

906
00:39:50.153 --> 00:39:51.553
that in any way.

907
00:39:51.633 --> 00:39:53.833
then...then you couldn't
live with yourself.

908
00:39:53.913 --> 00:39:57.273
Any other injuries that you were
told about or you read about?

909
00:39:57.353 --> 00:40:00.073
Oh. yeah. about the...
noughts and crosses. yeah.

910
00:40:00.153 --> 00:40:02.273
Or anything else
in relation to the other girl?

911
00:40:02.353 --> 00:40:03.993
-The Stevens girl?
-Nah.

912
00:40:04.073 --> 00:40:06.833
So. you know. you are playing
a bit of a game.

913
00:40:06.913 --> 00:40:11.393
You are...
you feel sadness and...

914
00:40:11.473 --> 00:40:13.593
..you know.
especially for the families.

915
00:40:13.673 --> 00:40:16.433
But at the end of the day. it's
all about getting him convicted.

916
00:40:16.513 --> 00:40:18.513
And if it means
being his best friend.

917
00:40:18.593 --> 00:40:21.033
then that's what you do.

918
00:40:22.633 --> 00:40:26.113
Do you know what day it was
when she allegedly went missing?

919
00:40:31.073 --> 00:40:34.473
Thursday night. wasn't it?
Yeah. Thursday night.

920
00:40:34.553 --> 00:40:37.033
Do you know what date that was?
Do you know what the...

921
00:40:37.113 --> 00:40:39.113
No. I don't remember
what date it was.

922
00:40:41.393 --> 00:40:43.513
If I told you
that she went missing

923
00:40:43.593 --> 00:40:46.713
on a Thursday night
on 8th July...

924
00:40:46.793 --> 00:40:49.393
8th. yeah.
You told me that earlier. 8th.

925
00:40:49.473 --> 00:40:50.713
Do you...

926
00:40:50.793 --> 00:40:52.993
Are you able to tell me

927
00:40:53.073 --> 00:40:55.873
your movements on that night?

928
00:40:55.953 --> 00:40:57.353
Yep.

929
00:40:57.433 --> 00:40:59.473
Uh...

930
00:40:59.553 --> 00:41:02.353
I was up at my brother's
place during the day.

931
00:41:03.433 --> 00:41:07.393
2:30 or something.
between 2:30 and 3:30.

932
00:41:07.473 --> 00:41:09.233
I was there for a while.

933
00:41:09.313 --> 00:41:11.913
So you were up at your brother's
place? This is on the Thursday?

934
00:41:11.993 --> 00:41:13.233
-Mm.
-Yeah?

935
00:41:13.313 --> 00:41:15.433
Well. that day I was...

936
00:41:15.513 --> 00:41:17.433
The only thing I remember
about that day

937
00:41:17.513 --> 00:41:19.913
is I was out the front of
my place having a cigarette...

938
00:41:19.993 --> 00:41:21.873
SILVESTER: This lack of guilt
means they can plan

939
00:41:21.953 --> 00:41:23.393
each crime without emotion

940
00:41:23.473 --> 00:41:26.113
and conceal their double life
from plain sight.

941
00:41:26.193 --> 00:41:29.433
To their few associates.
they may seem strange.

942
00:41:29.513 --> 00:41:32.913
but hardly capable
of cold-blooded murder.

943
00:41:32.993 --> 00:41:34.753
You know. we're talking
six weeks ago

944
00:41:34.833 --> 00:41:36.633
and he remembered
that he'd got on the bus

945
00:41:36.713 --> 00:41:39.353
and he remembered that he'd gone
to his mother-in-law's...

946
00:41:39.433 --> 00:41:42.313
..or his girlfriend's mother's
for dinner that night.

947
00:41:42.393 --> 00:41:46.233
You know. he remembered
such detail that it...

948
00:41:46.313 --> 00:41:48.153
You know. it beggared belief.

949
00:41:48.233 --> 00:41:50.073
If we look at the. um...

950
00:41:50.153 --> 00:41:53.993
These three particular people

951
00:41:54.073 --> 00:41:56.833
that have been murdered. Paul.

952
00:41:56.913 --> 00:42:02.433
yesterday your car was parked
opposite the location

953
00:42:02.513 --> 00:42:04.913
where the body
of Natalie Russell was found

954
00:42:04.993 --> 00:42:08.153
and you were in the vicinity
around the time.

955
00:42:08.233 --> 00:42:11.233
(LEAVES RUSTLE)

956
00:42:12.313 --> 00:42:14.313
Oh. I don't know
if I was in the vicinity.

957
00:42:14.393 --> 00:42:16.233
Well. OK.
and I'll withdraw that.

958
00:42:16.313 --> 00:42:18.433
You were certainly in the area

959
00:42:18.513 --> 00:42:20.073
of where her body
was discovered.

960
00:42:20.153 --> 00:42:21.713
Yeah.

961
00:42:21.793 --> 00:42:23.793
On the night that
Debbie Fream disappeared.

962
00:42:23.873 --> 00:42:26.113
you walked over
to Kananook railway station.

963
00:42:26.193 --> 00:42:28.273
missed the train
and walked back.

964
00:42:28.353 --> 00:42:30.193
Are you saying
that is the only night

965
00:42:30.273 --> 00:42:32.833
you missed the train
to pick Sharon up?

966
00:42:32.913 --> 00:42:35.033
I've missed it
a couple of times before that.

967
00:42:35.113 --> 00:42:37.673
Wherever you went.

968
00:42:37.753 --> 00:42:41.553
people were talking about it
in conversation.

969
00:42:41.633 --> 00:42:44.153
You'd be standing in a coffee
shop waiting for a coffee

970
00:42:44.233 --> 00:42:48.033
and someone would be talking
about Paul Denyer or his arrest.

971
00:42:48.113 --> 00:42:50.113
And on the night...

972
00:42:51.553 --> 00:42:53.873
..Elizabeth Stevens disappeared.

973
00:42:53.953 --> 00:42:58.233
you walked in a very close
proximity to Lloyd Park

974
00:42:58.313 --> 00:43:00.193
on your way to pick up
this battery?

975
00:43:00.273 --> 00:43:01.393
Mm-hm.

976
00:43:01.473 --> 00:43:02.993
Do you think that's
fairly coincidental?

977
00:43:03.073 --> 00:43:04.153
Yeah. it is.

978
00:43:04.233 --> 00:43:06.153
-All the circumstances?
-Yeah.

979
00:43:06.233 --> 00:43:08.393
Why did you pick a storm

980
00:43:08.473 --> 00:43:11.313
to go for a two-hour walk
to have a look at a battery?

981
00:43:12.393 --> 00:43:15.913
I don't know. I just felt like
walking up there that night.

982
00:43:15.993 --> 00:43:17.553
Well. I suggest to you
that's a lie.

983
00:43:17.633 --> 00:43:19.953
-What do you say to that?
-I don't reckon it's a lie.

984
00:43:20.033 --> 00:43:21.433
I suggest to you
you did not

985
00:43:21.513 --> 00:43:22.873
go to your parents' place
that night.

986
00:43:22.953 --> 00:43:24.953
I did.

987
00:43:25.313 --> 00:43:26.993
Have you ever carried a knife?

988
00:43:27.073 --> 00:43:28.913
I've carried a knife
a couple of times

989
00:43:28.993 --> 00:43:30.953
when I've walked down
to meet my girlfriend

990
00:43:31.033 --> 00:43:32.833
at night at the station.

991
00:43:32.913 --> 00:43:34.433
Why did you carry a knife?

992
00:43:34.513 --> 00:43:36.033
'Cause we had a bit of trouble

993
00:43:36.113 --> 00:43:38.833
with some local kids
down in Lloyd Park.

994
00:43:39.833 --> 00:43:41.753
What sort of knife
were you carrying?

995
00:43:41.833 --> 00:43:47.353
A Swiss... Like a Swiss Army
knife with a corkscrew on it.

996
00:43:47.433 --> 00:43:49.793
Uh. red handle.

997
00:43:49.873 --> 00:43:51.793
And where would you carry that?

998
00:43:51.873 --> 00:43:53.753
Oh. down me sock.

999
00:43:53.833 --> 00:43:55.433
-Down in your sock?
-Mm.

1000
00:43:55.513 --> 00:43:57.313
Why not in your pocket?

1001
00:43:57.393 --> 00:43:59.793
Oh. 'cause I had me keys
and me smokes in me pocket

1002
00:43:59.873 --> 00:44:01.273
and it's too bulgy.

1003
00:44:01.353 --> 00:44:02.913
-So you put it in your sock?
-Yeah.

1004
00:44:02.993 --> 00:44:05.673
Any other knives
you've carried on you?

1005
00:44:05.753 --> 00:44:08.513
No. not that I can recall.

1006
00:44:08.593 --> 00:44:10.513
Well. can you think about that?

1007
00:44:10.593 --> 00:44:12.513
WILSON: His level of offending

1008
00:44:12.593 --> 00:44:14.593
had started
when he was quite young.

1009
00:44:14.673 --> 00:44:18.273
I think he had issues
in his childhood

1010
00:44:18.353 --> 00:44:20.433
with his younger siblings.

1011
00:44:20.513 --> 00:44:23.153
He'd ripped the throats
out of a number of their toys.

1012
00:44:23.233 --> 00:44:26.193
That had progressed
to killing...

1013
00:44:26.273 --> 00:44:27.753
..cutting the throats
of rabbits.

1014
00:44:27.833 --> 00:44:29.513
to cutting the throats of goats.

1015
00:44:29.593 --> 00:44:31.193
to stalking people.

1016
00:44:31.273 --> 00:44:35.553
to...to approaching people
in supermarkets with knives.

1017
00:44:35.633 --> 00:44:38.073
to his attempt
to abduct someone...

1018
00:44:39.193 --> 00:44:41.193
..to killing.

1019
00:44:44.433 --> 00:44:49.233
And they do so without
any apparent remorse

1020
00:44:49.313 --> 00:44:51.753
and it seems to help them

1021
00:44:51.833 --> 00:44:54.873
get a sense of control
over their environment.

1022
00:44:54.953 --> 00:44:56.393
which they seek

1023
00:44:56.473 --> 00:44:59.433
and. of course.
that later manifests itself

1024
00:44:59.513 --> 00:45:01.513
in terrible ways.

1025
00:45:02.313 --> 00:45:07.033
The night that you walked
to Kananook railway station.

1026
00:45:07.113 --> 00:45:08.913
the night that Debbie Fream
disappeared.

1027
00:45:08.993 --> 00:45:10.513
were you armed with
a knife that night?

1028
00:45:10.593 --> 00:45:12.713
-No. no.
-Why not?

1029
00:45:13.713 --> 00:45:17.833
Oh. just forgot to take it
with me before I left.

1030
00:45:17.913 --> 00:45:21.393
Or I forgot to remember to take
it or something. I don't know.

1031
00:45:22.673 --> 00:45:25.033
WILSON: But you were going
to the railway station

1032
00:45:25.113 --> 00:45:26.673
on your own at night.

1033
00:45:26.753 --> 00:45:28.713
Mm.

1034
00:45:28.793 --> 00:45:30.033
WILSON: But you didn't
that night?

1035
00:45:30.113 --> 00:45:31.993
-DENYER: I didn't.
-You forgot?

1036
00:45:32.073 --> 00:45:35.593
I just didn't think
of taking it. That's all.

1037
00:45:35.673 --> 00:45:37.673
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

1038
00:45:40.753 --> 00:45:42.993
(THUNDER CRACKS)

1039
00:45:46.833 --> 00:45:49.553
Are you responsible for the
deaths of any of these women?

1040
00:45:49.633 --> 00:45:51.633
No.

1041
00:45:54.953 --> 00:45:57.793
Interestingly enough.
when you see the interview.

1042
00:45:57.873 --> 00:45:59.393
we have to get permission

1043
00:45:59.473 --> 00:46:02.073
to do what we call
a forensic procedure.

1044
00:46:02.153 --> 00:46:04.553
and that permission
was asked for.

1045
00:46:04.633 --> 00:46:08.233
that we wanted a hair. blood
sample. medical examination.

1046
00:46:08.313 --> 00:46:10.873
and hadn't we got
his permission.

1047
00:46:10.953 --> 00:46:14.953
we'd have to then sit down.
do a 15-. 20-. 30-page affidavit

1048
00:46:15.033 --> 00:46:17.473
to show to a magistrate or judge

1049
00:46:17.553 --> 00:46:19.913
that he was
a significant suspect.

1050
00:46:19.993 --> 00:46:22.833
But we didn't have to
go down that path.

1051
00:46:22.913 --> 00:46:28.073
Alright. Paul. do you agree
the time is now 12:40am?

1052
00:46:28.153 --> 00:46:29.193
Yes.

1053
00:46:29.273 --> 00:46:30.953
Now. um...

1054
00:46:31.033 --> 00:46:33.513
..you realise that you are not
obliged to say or do anything

1055
00:46:33.593 --> 00:46:35.833
unless you wish to.
but whatever you do say...

1056
00:46:35.913 --> 00:46:37.913
And they were just
talking casually.

1057
00:46:37.993 --> 00:46:39.473
waiting. biding time

1058
00:46:39.553 --> 00:46:41.473
until the medical doctor arrived

1059
00:46:41.553 --> 00:46:45.513
to take blood samples
and other. um...

1060
00:46:46.513 --> 00:46:49.273
..medical examinations.

1061
00:46:49.353 --> 00:46:51.953
Again. you're not obliged
to give a sample of your hair

1062
00:46:52.033 --> 00:46:53.593
as has been explained to you

1063
00:46:53.673 --> 00:46:55.273
in relation to your blood
and fingerprints.

1064
00:46:55.353 --> 00:46:58.153
Um. will you give us
a sample of your hair?

1065
00:46:58.233 --> 00:47:00.233
-Yeah.
-Alright. then.

1066
00:47:02.313 --> 00:47:06.153
And. um. I was praying.

1067
00:47:07.153 --> 00:47:11.513
My prayers were in my mind.
under my breath.

1068
00:47:11.593 --> 00:47:13.473
for the truth to come out.

1069
00:47:13.553 --> 00:47:17.353
That's what the community
wanted. That's what was right.

1070
00:47:20.633 --> 00:47:26.153
And mid-sentence.
between the detective and. um...

1071
00:47:27.153 --> 00:47:28.593
..himself.

1072
00:47:28.673 --> 00:47:32.633
he just turned to face me.

1073
00:47:32.713 --> 00:47:36.193
He says. "That man there
gets in my head."

1074
00:47:36.273 --> 00:47:39.593
like. harsh tone.

1075
00:47:40.673 --> 00:47:43.593
Demeanour had changed.

1076
00:47:43.673 --> 00:47:45.673
Wasn't that calm. collected.

1077
00:47:45.753 --> 00:47:49.633
devoid-of-emotion Paul Denyer
you see in the interview.

1078
00:47:49.713 --> 00:47:53.713
It was the only time that I felt

1079
00:47:53.793 --> 00:47:56.833
that you actually got to see

1080
00:47:56.913 --> 00:47:59.993
the evil that the girls
had experienced.

1081
00:48:00.993 --> 00:48:03.313
SILVESTER: It took Wilson
more than 1.500 questions

1082
00:48:03.393 --> 00:48:05.313
to break Denyer's story.

1083
00:48:05.393 --> 00:48:07.953
The breakthrough came at 4am.

1084
00:48:08.033 --> 00:48:12.473
37 hours after his latest
and final murder.

1085
00:48:12.553 --> 00:48:16.553
I believe the Homicide squad
detectives left the room.

1086
00:48:16.633 --> 00:48:19.993
getting him a coffee.

1087
00:48:20.073 --> 00:48:22.233
He said. "I did it."

1088
00:48:22.313 --> 00:48:24.433
I said. "Did what?"

1089
00:48:24.513 --> 00:48:27.313
"I committed the murders.
I committed all three."

1090
00:48:28.313 --> 00:48:30.833
I did wear a crucifix

1091
00:48:30.913 --> 00:48:34.793
and. um. he must have seen that.

1092
00:48:34.873 --> 00:48:38.113
I said. "OK. hold that thought."

1093
00:48:38.193 --> 00:48:40.193
took him back into the room

1094
00:48:40.273 --> 00:48:44.673
and. um. a Homicide squad
detective was nearby.

1095
00:48:44.753 --> 00:48:46.353
I said. "He's admitted
the offences."

1096
00:48:46.433 --> 00:48:49.193
and they said.
"Stay there. Don't move.

1097
00:48:49.273 --> 00:48:51.793
"Shut the door."
and they disappeared.

1098
00:48:51.873 --> 00:48:53.993
Then someone came back down

1099
00:48:54.073 --> 00:48:56.833
and said. "Darren. you're now
doing the interview."

1100
00:48:56.913 --> 00:48:58.753
and I went. "OK."

1101
00:48:58.833 --> 00:49:00.953
You told Detective O'Loughlin

1102
00:49:01.033 --> 00:49:02.633
that you were responsible
for the murders

1103
00:49:02.713 --> 00:49:04.713
of the three women.

1104
00:49:04.793 --> 00:49:06.713
Is that correct?

1105
00:49:06.793 --> 00:49:10.793
Before we go any further.
um. Paul...

1106
00:49:10.873 --> 00:49:15.353
RANKIN: Young Darren O'Loughlin.
he walked into the muster room

1107
00:49:15.433 --> 00:49:18.193
and he was ashen

1108
00:49:18.273 --> 00:49:19.953
and he looked out the window

1109
00:49:20.033 --> 00:49:21.633
and I remember looking
at him and thinking.

1110
00:49:21.713 --> 00:49:25.113
you know. "He's really...
He's had a tough day."

1111
00:49:25.193 --> 00:49:27.353
It was very. very difficult

1112
00:49:27.433 --> 00:49:29.793
sitting through
what he just sat through

1113
00:49:29.873 --> 00:49:32.673
and you could see it
in his face.

1114
00:49:32.753 --> 00:49:35.233
He was just very quiet.

1115
00:49:36.233 --> 00:49:39.273
I held her hand
to make it look like...

1116
00:49:39.353 --> 00:49:42.033
..you know. a couple. I suppose.

1117
00:49:42.113 --> 00:49:45.153
so we wouldn't arouse
any suspicion.

1118
00:49:45.233 --> 00:49:49.233
We walked past two people
on the footpath.

1119
00:49:49.313 --> 00:49:52.113
a guy and a girl. and they just
didn't take any notice.

1120
00:49:52.193 --> 00:49:53.833
She didn't even
scream out or anything?

1121
00:49:53.913 --> 00:49:55.953
No.

1122
00:49:56.033 --> 00:49:59.073
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

1123
00:50:09.873 --> 00:50:11.273
I threw her on the ground

1124
00:50:11.353 --> 00:50:13.153
and stuck my foot over her neck.

1125
00:50:13.233 --> 00:50:15.553
Right. Why did you do that?

1126
00:50:15.633 --> 00:50:18.073
-Oh. to finish it off.
-Right.

1127
00:50:20.633 --> 00:50:23.793
As...as a policeman. you...

1128
00:50:24.793 --> 00:50:27.273
..are not shocked
by too many things

1129
00:50:27.353 --> 00:50:31.393
because. unfortunately. you see
the worst of human behaviour.

1130
00:50:31.473 --> 00:50:35.033
you've. unfortunately. gone
to some horrific crime scenes.

1131
00:50:35.113 --> 00:50:37.273
So. um...

1132
00:50:41.313 --> 00:50:43.833
But there were moments
in that interview

1133
00:50:43.913 --> 00:50:45.713
that certainly
sat me back in my seat.

1134
00:50:45.793 --> 00:50:50.913
and...and I felt all of us
were in that position

1135
00:50:50.993 --> 00:50:56.113
in the way he described some
of the ways he murdered a woman.

1136
00:50:56.193 --> 00:50:58.193
Um...

1137
00:51:07.753 --> 00:51:09.193
Just wanted to take a life

1138
00:51:09.273 --> 00:51:13.473
because I felt my life
had been taken many times.

1139
00:51:13.553 --> 00:51:15.233
By whom?

1140
00:51:15.313 --> 00:51:20.433
I think that there is
considerable evidence about him

1141
00:51:20.513 --> 00:51:25.633
that there may be. um. a pattern

1142
00:51:25.713 --> 00:51:28.593
that you see
in a lot of serial killers

1143
00:51:28.673 --> 00:51:31.353
of a traumatic background.

1144
00:51:31.433 --> 00:51:33.993
There wasn't a lot of evidence

1145
00:51:34.073 --> 00:51:38.273
and he hasn't. as I understand.
talked very much about it.

1146
00:51:38.353 --> 00:51:40.393
but there's enough
for me to suspect

1147
00:51:40.473 --> 00:51:42.873
that he had
a traumatic upbringing

1148
00:51:42.953 --> 00:51:47.673
and that many of the things
that happened to him

1149
00:51:47.753 --> 00:51:52.913
sowed the seeds
of what happened later on.

1150
00:51:54.993 --> 00:51:58.393
DENYER: I broke into her place
and killed all of her cats.

1151
00:52:00.313 --> 00:52:02.313
WILSON: Why'd you do that for?

1152
00:52:03.073 --> 00:52:04.513
DENYER: I went there
to kill her.

1153
00:52:04.593 --> 00:52:06.593
but she wasn't home.

1154
00:52:13.713 --> 00:52:17.793
You went to Donna's flat
on Claude Street to kill her?

1155
00:52:17.873 --> 00:52:19.713
-Yeah.
-And she wasn't home?

1156
00:52:19.793 --> 00:52:21.193
No. she wasn't home.

1157
00:52:21.273 --> 00:52:24.713
So you broke in and...
What did you do?

1158
00:52:24.793 --> 00:52:26.273
I killed her cats.

1159
00:52:26.353 --> 00:52:28.073
-How many of them?
-Three.

1160
00:52:28.153 --> 00:52:30.553
-How did you kill her cats?
-Stabbed them.

1161
00:52:32.753 --> 00:52:34.153
When would you say

1162
00:52:34.233 --> 00:52:37.753
that you first had
a feeling. this aggression.

1163
00:52:37.833 --> 00:52:40.193
when you were
walking around here?

1164
00:52:40.273 --> 00:52:43.913
When did you first start
to feel like you had to kill?

1165
00:52:43.993 --> 00:52:46.833
I like to think
about it this way.

1166
00:52:46.913 --> 00:52:49.793
You've got genetics
and personality

which load and point the gun

1168
00:52:52.393 --> 00:52:55.073
and it's the environment
that fires it.

(SOMBRE MUSIC)

1170
00:53:03.033 --> 00:53:06.033
I started choking her
with my hands

1171
00:53:06.113 --> 00:53:09.873
and. uh. she passed out
after a while.

1172
00:53:10.873 --> 00:53:12.633
BEZZINA: Everything started
falling into place.

1173
00:53:12.713 --> 00:53:17.833
The...the trauma. the fear
that she would've gone through.

1174

it all hits home to you.

1175
00:53:20.953 --> 00:53:22.273
DENYER: The blade broke off.

1176
00:53:22.353 --> 00:53:23.673
WILSON: Where would
the blade be?

1177
00:53:23.753 --> 00:53:24.873
DENYER: In the same spot.

1178
00:53:24.953 --> 00:53:27.153
WILSON: Did you break
the blade off?

1179
00:53:27.233 --> 00:53:31.193
DENYER: Well. it bent
when I was stabbing her.

1180

The blade went. "Zoom!"

the rest of it off

down a side street

-I might have.

who's committed
such serious offences

1221
00:55:34.353 --> 00:55:38.753

the dreadful things that he did.

1222
00:55:40.873 --> 00:55:42.953
Most of your classic psychopaths

1223
00:55:43.033 --> 00:55:47.113
have no remorse
and they have no empathy.

1224
00:55:47.193 --> 00:55:49.873
What they love is attention.

1225
00:55:49.953 --> 00:55:52.953
So this is almost like. um.

1226
00:55:53.033 --> 00:55:56.513

It was abhorrent in every sense.

1237
00:56:31.593 --> 00:56:35.673
But the way he described
to take a life

1238
00:56:35.753 --> 00:56:38.553
really sat me back in my seat.

at that stage?

..she started talking
Spanish or something.

1256
00:57:39.113 --> 00:57:41.873
And. um. I spoke back
in Spanish.

1257

Do you speak Spanish?

1258
00:57:43.433 --> 00:57:46.113
-No. only a few words.
-Oh. yeah.

1259
00:57:46.193 --> 00:57:48.873
-Um...
-What did you say back to her?

1260
00:57:50.193 --> 00:57:52.593
'Pistola'. Pistol.

1261
00:57:52.673 --> 00:57:54.353
Right. OK.

1262
00:57:54.433 --> 00:57:57.353
And. um. she screamed a bit

1263
00:57:57.433 --> 00:58:01.193
and then bit me
on the finger here.

1264
00:58:01.273 --> 00:58:03.233

I wrestled her. She ran out on
the road. but no-one stopped.

1267
00:58:10.193 --> 00:58:11.793
I grabbed her by the hair

1268

and dragged her back
towards the park

1269

"Shut up or I'll blow
your fuckin' head off."

00:58:19.513 --> 00:58:21.673
And she said. "OK. OK."

or. "Sí. sí."
in Spanish or something.

1274

And then...

1275
00:58:27.153 --> 00:58:30.393
(CHUCKLES) And then she stood up

1276
00:58:30.473 --> 00:58:32.873
and went against her word

1277
00:58:32.953 --> 00:58:34.473
and ran out on the road again

1278
00:58:34.553 --> 00:58:36.673
and I just took off
into the park.

that night

1280

to kill that night

00:58:51.313 --> 00:58:55.113
and she was a very lucky girl
to get away.

1282
00:58:55.193 --> 00:58:58.313
Sometime after that.
there was a second death

1283
00:58:58.393 --> 00:59:02.753
of a girl by the name
of Deborah Fream.

1284
00:59:03.873 --> 00:59:06.913
Can you relate to me
how that came about?

1285
00:59:08.953 --> 00:59:11.233
While she was in the milk bar
I walked to the car

1286
00:59:11.313 --> 00:59:15.153
and. um...and checked the
driver's door - it was unlocked.

1287
00:59:15.233 --> 00:59:16.473
Right.

1288
00:59:16.553 --> 00:59:18.353
So I opened the door.
put my hand through

1289
00:59:18.433 --> 00:59:19.953
and unlocked the back door.

1290
00:59:20.033 --> 00:59:21.113
Right.

1291
00:59:21.193 --> 00:59:23.873
Then I hopped in the car

1292
00:59:23.953 --> 00:59:26.273
and crouched down
behind the seat

1293
00:59:26.353 --> 00:59:29.033
and pulled out
the gun that I had.

as she was doing that turn

and she kept going straight
into the wall of the milk bar.

1297

I told her to. you know. shut up

1298

1306

a very frank confession

and as horrifying
as it was to hear. um.

what he told us. of course.

by all the evidence

at the crime scenes.

you looking for?

so you wouldn't be
able to trace my shoes.

1317
01:00:47.433 --> 01:00:52.873
I'm assuming that he would have
quite disordered thinking

1318
01:00:52.953 --> 01:00:57.713
and he would almost lose contact
with reality sometime.

1319

that he thought.

a lot of the things that he did

1321

is that there are delusions
and there are hallucinations.

no resemblance to reality.

that they do

a woman in Frankston

1557
01:14:26.153 --> 01:14:28.473
that doesn't check her back
seat before she gets in the car.

1558
01:14:28.553 --> 01:14:31.433
The only...the only thing
that gave us any consolation

1559
01:14:31.513 --> 01:14:33.113
was the fact
that he was locked up

1560
01:14:33.193 --> 01:14:34.873
and couldn't do this
to any other family.

1561
01:14:34.953 --> 01:14:36.353
And guess what.

1562
01:14:36.433 --> 01:14:38.473
The government
now have to legislate...

1563
01:14:38.553 --> 01:14:40.433
And I hope that they do.

1564
01:14:40.513 --> 01:14:43.633
They need to legislate
to keep this animal

1565
01:14:43.713 --> 01:14:46.073
in jail where he belongs

1566
01:14:46.153 --> 01:14:48.633
because he's never
gonna be fixed.

1567
01:14:48.713 --> 01:14:50.553
he's programmed that way.

1568
01:14:50.633 --> 01:14:53.033
and we need to keep
the community safe.

1569
01:14:54.513 --> 01:14:56.033
SILVESTER: While in prison.

1570
01:14:56.113 --> 01:14:58.113
Denyer claimed
he was transitioning

1571
01:14:58.193 --> 01:14:59.633
and for a period of time

1572
01:14:59.713 --> 01:15:02.273
wanted to be referred to
as 'Paula'.

1573
01:15:02.353 --> 01:15:05.353
At one point.
he suggested his crimes

1574
01:15:05.433 --> 01:15:08.273
were due to the fact
that he hated women

1575
01:15:08.353 --> 01:15:10.353
because he wanted to be one.

1576
01:15:10.433 --> 01:15:13.833
All of this is totally
irrelevant to what he did.

1577
01:15:13.913 --> 01:15:16.993
It's not an excuse.
It's not a reason.

1578
01:15:17.073 --> 01:15:19.073
He was fully aware
of what he was doing.

1579
01:15:19.153 --> 01:15:20.913
He went out to murder.

1580
01:15:20.993 --> 01:15:24.593
Now in prison.

1581
01:15:24.673 --> 01:15:26.713
he's returned to 'Paul' Denyer.

1582
01:15:26.793 --> 01:15:28.993
If ever I've seen a person...

1583
01:15:30.313 --> 01:15:35.873
..who doesn't deserve freedom.
it's Paul Denyer.

1584
01:15:36.873 --> 01:15:38.873
He'll never...

1585
01:15:39.513 --> 01:15:42.793
..he'll never not be
a risk to the community.

1586
01:15:42.873 --> 01:15:44.873
Never.

1587
01:15:45.633 --> 01:15:48.153
We have to be sure 100%

1588
01:15:48.233 --> 01:15:52.633
that Paul Charles Denyer
is no longer a risk to women.

1589
01:15:52.713 --> 01:15:55.433
No-one can give that guarantee.

1590
01:15:55.513 --> 01:15:58.433
The conclusion is inevitable.

1591
01:15:58.513 --> 01:16:00.593
Denyer must remain in prison

1592
01:16:00.673 --> 01:16:04.473
until he is so infirmed
he can't be a risk

1593
01:16:04.553 --> 01:16:06.473
or he's dead -

1594
01:16:06.553 --> 01:16:10.513
the very sentence Frank Vincent
gave him in the first place.
