I know that you've been so busy with work.

6
00:00:16.979 --> 00:00:21.647
and I know things have
been picking up for you.

7
00:00:21.647 --> 00:00:26.145
The fact that you were able

- Yeah. me too.

9
00:00:28.946 --> 00:00:32.446
I'm glad we could connect again and stuff.

10
00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:35.650
- Things have been getting a little bit

11
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.983
better for me too. you know?

12
00:00:40.854 --> 00:00:42.567

I will leave your check here. and I will

14

take care of that for you
whenever you're ready.

15
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.013
- Thank you.

16
00:00:47.013 --> 00:00:48.315
Thank you so much.
- Sure.

17
00:00:48.315 --> 00:00:49.680
- She was really wonderful.

18
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.240
Yeah. she was great.

19
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.216
- We should tip her really well.

20
00:00:52.216 --> 00:00:53.299
Oh.

21
00:00:54.455 --> 00:00:55.372
Yeah. okay.

22
00:00:57.847 --> 00:00:58.933
Oh. boy.

23
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.843
- Work's been really well.

24
00:01:00.843 --> 00:01:02.655
Oh gosh. though.

25
00:01:02.655 --> 00:01:06.479
Would you mind. baby. just
this time covering it?

26
00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.896
- I never expect you to have to cover me.

27
00:01:11.468 --> 00:01:13.669
I'm grateful for any time we have.

28
00:01:13.669 --> 00:01:15.243
We can go Dutch.

29
00:01:15.243 --> 00:01:18.565
I really don't need
you to pay for my half.

30
00:01:18.565 --> 00:01:20.626
- I'm going to need
you to go a hundo-Dutch

31
00:01:20.626 --> 00:01:23.376
this time. like. just solo-Dutch.

32
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.950
But you did order the tiramisu. so really.

33
00:01:28.952 --> 00:01:31.535
that's on you anyway. you know?

34
00:01:32.562 --> 00:01:33.395
- Excuse me.

35
00:01:33.395 --> 00:01:34.228
- Yes.

36
00:01:35.827 --> 00:01:37.868
Do you take Mobile Pay?

37
00:01:37.868 --> 00:01:39.554
- We do not. no. I'm sorry.

38
00:01:39.554 --> 00:01:41.174
- Sorry. that was a dumb question.

39
00:01:41.174 --> 00:01:42.150
I'm so sorry.

40
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.483
You have credit cards. baby.

41
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.583
Hey.

42
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.350
Don't embarrass us again like that. okay?

43
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.183
Wow.

44
00:01:53.922 --> 00:01:54.922
- I'm sorry.

45
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.487
- I'm going to try not to
keep you here too much longer.

46
00:02:07.487 --> 00:02:09.574
I do want to get this meeting wrapped up.

47
00:02:09.574 --> 00:02:10.897
- Yeah. I'll be-
- Finally.

48
00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:13.764
- Oh. we have a stupid meeting right now.

49
00:02:13.764 --> 00:02:17.020
Yeah. no. it's all right. just Ted.

50
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.874
Okay.

51
00:02:17.874 --> 00:02:19.100
Oh my god. no way.

52
00:02:20.137 --> 00:02:21.524
- Would you like to join us?

53
00:02:21.524 --> 00:02:23.999
- Hey. Ted. seriously?

54
00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:25.524
- Yeah. we all have lives. too.

55
00:02:25.524 --> 00:02:26.687
- Yeah. no. sorry.

56
00:02:26.687 --> 00:02:27.520
- Goodbye.

57
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.287
- Awesome. all right. see you later. bye.

58
00:02:29.287 --> 00:02:30.120
- Thank you.

59
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.561
The last thing that I needed to go over.

60
00:02:32.561 --> 00:02:36.516
based on the comment cards
from the customers this month.

61
00:02:36.516 --> 00:02:37.349
- It's heavy.

62
00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:38.349
- Oh. sorry.

63
00:02:39.807 --> 00:02:43.833
I need to announce that Stacy
is our Employee of the Month.

64
00:02:43.833 --> 00:02:45.632
- Oh. again?

65
00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:47.305
Just kidding. it happens every month.

66
00:02:47.305 --> 00:02:49.263
- I'll just kind of mention
as we're wrapping up here.

67
00:02:49.263 --> 00:02:51.881
I am considering implementing
an employee dress code.

68
00:02:51.881 --> 00:02:53.193
- Why. Ted?

69
00:02:53.193 --> 00:02:54.026
No.

70
00:02:54.026 --> 00:02:55.815
- This is just a general announcement.

71
00:02:55.815 --> 00:02:57.013
This might be in the works.

72
00:02:57.013 --> 00:02:58.924
I'm just talking about professional dress.

73
00:02:58.924 --> 00:03:00.016
That's all talking about.

74
00:03:00.016 --> 00:03:00.849
- What?

75
00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:01.685
No.

76
00:03:01.685 --> 00:03:02.518
- We can talk later.

77
00:03:02.518 --> 00:03:03.860
- No. why would we meet later?

78
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.146
No. we're all here right now.

79
00:03:05.146 --> 00:03:06.378
- I will make an announcement-

80
00:03:06.378 --> 00:03:09.968
- Is this because Autumn
looks like a tool?

81
00:03:09.968 --> 00:03:11.300
- This has nothing to do with Autumn.

82
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.133
So. it has to do with me?

83
00:03:12.133 --> 00:03:13.608
No. I'm not singling anybody out.

84
00:03:13.608 --> 00:03:14.441
is what I'm trying to-

85
00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:17.236
- This is my body shaming boss.

86
00:03:17.236 --> 00:03:20.516
who thinks that my god-given
body is disgusting.

87
00:03:20.516 --> 00:03:22.290
- I'm talking about anybody's body.

88
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.614
I'm just trying to uphold a certain

89
00:03:24.614 --> 00:03:26.111
professional standard for everyone.

90
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:30.125
- Ted. you let Stacy dress
the way Stacy wants to dress.

91
00:03:30.125 --> 00:03:31.953
I look forward to that every day.

92
00:03:31.953 --> 00:03:33.032
Thank you. Roy.

93
00:03:33.032 --> 00:03:36.001
- Okay. I'm just going to wrap
up this meeting right now.

94
00:03:36.001 --> 00:03:38.173
I just need one more thing for Autumn.

95
00:03:38.173 --> 00:03:39.609
I just need to let you know someone

96
00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:41.530
took a dump and kind of missed the bowl.

97
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.033
So. if you could clean that up
real quick. that'd be great.

98
00:03:44.033 --> 00:03:46.602
Thank you so much. thank
you everyone. great meeting.

99
00:03:46.602 --> 00:03:48.221
- Hey. I'd stay and help you with that.

100
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:49.875
but I really got to go.

101
00:03:49.875 --> 00:03:51.441
But I love you. okay?

102
00:03:51.441 --> 00:03:52.959
Sorry.

103
00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.052
- I got to go too. but
not as bad as that guy.

104
00:03:59.307 --> 00:04:01.724
- He was clearly very disturbed.

105
00:04:01.724 --> 00:04:04.839
And so I definitely knew
that we needed to focus on-

106
00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:06.839
- Hey. can I have these?

107
00:04:08.128 --> 00:04:11.045
Yeah. they're good. I want 'em. so.

108
00:04:14.752 --> 00:04:15.585
Go on.

109
00:04:17.117 --> 00:04:21.200
- So yeah. so I guess her
dog died two weeks ago.

110
00:04:22.045 --> 00:04:23.459
so it was very. very apparent that

111
00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:24.563
she needed some lower back-

112
00:04:24.563 --> 00:04:26.563
- Jimmy. what's up. man?

113
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.540
Get the fuck outta here.

114
00:04:30.647 --> 00:04:31.480
No.

115
00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:34.247
- Hey. Autumn.

116
00:04:34.247 --> 00:04:35.080
- Hi.

117
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.891
- Hey. can I borrow a dollar?

118
00:04:37.891 --> 00:04:38.891
Like. maybe?

119
00:04:40.891 --> 00:04:43.141
Yeah. that's it. thank you.

120
00:04:51.532 --> 00:04:52.445
Hey.

121
00:04:52.445 --> 00:04:53.618
- Hey.

122
00:04:55.524 --> 00:04:57.247
Is everything okay?

123
00:04:57.247 --> 00:04:59.498
Yeah. everything's good.

124
00:04:59.498 --> 00:05:01.728
- It's really loud.

125
00:05:01.728 --> 00:05:02.792
Are you sure you're okay?

126
00:05:02.792 --> 00:05:03.625
Where are you?

127
00:05:03.625 --> 00:05:07.405
Yeah. oh. I'm
at work. I'm at work.

128
00:05:07.405 --> 00:05:12.405
- Oh. okay. I just thought we
were gonna hang out tonight.

129
00:05:12.555 --> 00:05:14.808
Yeah. no it's Jan's
birthday and stuff over here.

130
00:05:14.808 --> 00:05:17.351
I mean. we're going to
hang out still. but.

131
00:05:17.351 --> 00:05:20.018
- Oh. okay. so five. 10 minutes?

132
00:05:21.445 --> 00:05:24.297
Yeah. no. I mean.
I'll be there in an hour.

133
00:05:24.297 --> 00:05:26.005
Give me an hour. or so.

134
00:05:26.005 --> 00:05:26.838
- Oh.

135
00:05:27.682 --> 00:05:28.936
It's Jan's birthday.

136
00:05:28.936 --> 00:05:30.202
- Oh. okay.

137
00:05:30.202 --> 00:05:31.926
And that's who is in the background?

138
00:05:31.926 --> 00:05:33.883
No. that's Chastity.

139
00:05:33.883 --> 00:05:35.171
- Oh.

140
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:36.296
Okay.

141
00:05:36.296 --> 00:05:38.001
Hey. I got gotta go.

142
00:05:38.001 --> 00:05:39.001
Jiminy tits!

143
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:41.223
- Oh.

144
00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.416
Hello?

145
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:00.583
Hello?

146
00:06:00.583 --> 00:06:03.666
Ah shit. I butt-dialed her.

147
00:06:05.556 --> 00:06:06.651
- Hey. bitch.

148
00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:07.484
- Hey.

149
00:06:07.484 --> 00:06:08.860
- Wanna go get something to eat?

150
00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.389
- Ah. not tonight. I am beat.

151
00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:13.984
I have been tired the past three days.

152
00:06:13.984 --> 00:06:15.067
- Oh. my god.

153
00:06:17.679 --> 00:06:20.472
Autumn. I think you might be pregnant.

154
00:06:20.472 --> 00:06:21.484
- What?

155
00:06:21.484 --> 00:06:22.806
- Hear me out.

156
00:06:22.806 --> 00:06:26.255
You've been really tired.
you've been super bloated.

157
00:06:26.255 --> 00:06:28.077
- Oh my god. you noticed. too?

158
00:06:28.077 --> 00:06:31.229
- Not to mention you have
this amazing glow about you.

159
00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:32.287
- Oh. thanks.

160
00:06:32.287 --> 00:06:34.967
- And your tits are huge.

161
00:06:34.967 --> 00:06:36.013
- They're really sore.

162
00:06:36.013 --> 00:06:38.680
- Yeah. they look super swollen.

163
00:06:39.727 --> 00:06:41.705
Hopefully it's nothing.

164
00:06:41.705 --> 00:06:42.538
- It's nothing.

165
00:06:42.538 --> 00:06:43.570
- But you should come over to my house.

166
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.676
I have extra pregnancy
tests. just in case.

167
00:06:47.676 --> 00:06:50.759
- You'd let me use one
of your pregnancy tests?

168
00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:54.109
- I want you to come over and
use one of my pregnancy tests.

169
00:06:54.109 --> 00:06:56.950
What if you find out that it's positive?

170
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.194
You need your best friend there with you.

171
00:06:59.194 --> 00:07:01.436
And I mean. it's probably nothing.

172
00:07:01.436 --> 00:07:03.380
- Yeah. I get like this one I have gluten.

173
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.213
I swell up.

174
00:07:04.213 --> 00:07:05.746
- Yeah. exactly. so you probably just

175
00:07:05.746 --> 00:07:07.348
ate gluten. it's totally fine.

176
00:07:07.348 --> 00:07:11.015
But if it is something.
we need to find out.

177
00:07:12.047 --> 00:07:13.546
But then again. weight gain

178
00:07:13.546 --> 00:07:16.379
is really normal around your age.

179
00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:21.156
All right. well come meet me up on my car.

180
00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:34.423
Hey. bitch.

181
00:07:34.423 --> 00:07:36.383
I was gonna borrow your favorite shirt

182
00:07:36.383 --> 00:07:39.064
to go into the color run today. okay?

183
00:07:39.064 --> 00:07:40.516
Is that cool?

184
00:07:40.516 --> 00:07:41.349
- Okay.

185
00:07:42.185 --> 00:07:44.610
- It's probably going to get ruined.

186
00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.794
It's the one with the tassels.

187
00:07:46.794 --> 00:07:47.627
- Okay.

188
00:07:50.578 --> 00:07:52.314
- Autumn. are you kidding me?

189
00:07:52.314 --> 00:07:56.267
This is your favorite shirt.
despite how ugly it is.

190
00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:58.705
You can't just let people walk

191
00:07:58.705 --> 00:08:01.788
all over you and treat you like crap.

192
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:08.720
What I meant to say. is in nine months.

193
00:08:09.815 --> 00:08:13.982
you're about to have this
come out of your vagina.

194
00:08:15.289 --> 00:08:17.497
Do you think it's going to be easy?

195
00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:19.981
Do you think it's just
going to walk on out?

196
00:08:19.981 --> 00:08:23.699
No. you have to force
it out. Autumn. okay?

197
00:08:23.699 --> 00:08:26.251
You gotta stop letting people shit on you.

198
00:08:26.251 --> 00:08:29.974
Ethan shits on you. our boss shits on you.

199
00:08:29.974 --> 00:08:31.469
Birds shit on you. Autumn.

200
00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:34.963
Everyone shits on you. and it sucks.

201
00:08:34.963 --> 00:08:38.047
So. you need to grow a
pair and tell the world.

202
00:08:38.047 --> 00:08:39.964
nah. nuh-uh. no. no-no.

203
00:08:41.577 --> 00:08:44.189
The baby deserves to have a strong mommy.

204
00:08:44.189 --> 00:08:46.764
and you have to do that.

205
00:08:46.764 --> 00:08:47.597
- Okay.

206
00:08:48.995 --> 00:08:52.686
- Stop fighting with me.
it's bad for the baby.

207
00:08:52.686 --> 00:08:53.686
- I'm sorry.

208
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:57.379
- Apology accepted.

209
00:08:57.379 --> 00:08:58.265
- I'm gonna have a child.

210
00:08:58.265 --> 00:09:00.432
I have to support a child.

211
00:09:01.322 --> 00:09:05.383
My parents are going to be so proud now.

212
00:09:05.383 --> 00:09:09.121
because not only did I
not go to medical school.

213
00:09:09.121 --> 00:09:13.687
I became a masseuse. got
pregnant. had a child

214
00:09:13.687 --> 00:09:16.356
with Ethan. and you know what?

215
00:09:16.356 --> 00:09:19.939
My parents. they think
I just touch people.

216
00:09:22.576 --> 00:09:25.633
We go on family reunions.
they say. what does Autumn do?

217
00:09:25.633 --> 00:09:27.550
Oh. she touches people.

218
00:09:29.073 --> 00:09:31.656
- Well. you do touch people for

219
00:09:32.581 --> 00:09:35.414
your living. so they're not wrong.

220
00:09:36.583 --> 00:09:38.088
Okay.

221
00:09:38.088 --> 00:09:39.255
Um. excuse me?

222
00:09:41.196 --> 00:09:45.852
This is a hand-blown
glass coaster from Mexico.

223
00:09:45.852 --> 00:09:47.957
Don't put your piss-stick all over it.

224
00:09:47.957 --> 00:09:49.992
Coasters are for drinks.

225
00:09:49.992 --> 00:09:51.151
- I'm sorry.

226
00:09:51.151 --> 00:09:53.490
- Anyways. you need to tell Ethan.

227
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.073
You should call him and tell him.

228
00:09:55.073 --> 00:09:57.740
Just rip it off like a band-aid.

229
00:09:58.959 --> 00:10:01.896
- Oh my god. we were doing so well.

230
00:10:01.896 --> 00:10:03.058
- Were you?

231
00:10:03.058 --> 00:10:04.196
- You think I should call him?

232
00:10:04.196 --> 00:10:05.029
- Oh yeah.

233
00:10:06.302 --> 00:10:09.096
I would not tell him in person.

234
00:10:09.096 --> 00:10:10.522
Oh. god no.

235
00:10:10.522 --> 00:10:11.355
- Why not?

236
00:10:11.355 --> 00:10:12.525
It'd make it more genuine. right?

237
00:10:12.525 --> 00:10:14.984
- No. are you kidding?

238
00:10:14.984 --> 00:10:18.229
Haven't you ever seen
those murder mystery shows?

239
00:10:18.229 --> 00:10:21.461
Women will tell their husbands
that they're pregnant.

240
00:10:21.461 --> 00:10:24.378
and then they wind up dead. Autumn.

241
00:10:25.515 --> 00:10:29.269
No mystery there. the husbands did it.

242
00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:31.153
- Oh my god. I don't want to die.

243
00:10:31.153 --> 00:10:35.317
- Tell him. let him absorb
it. let him calm down.

244
00:10:35.317 --> 00:10:37.790
- Okay. I'll call him.

245
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:39.466
It'll be fine.

246
00:10:39.466 --> 00:10:41.467
- Oh yeah. and then. you
guys can live together

247
00:10:41.467 --> 00:10:45.481
happily ever after. and shit like that.

248
00:10:45.481 --> 00:10:47.940
- This could fix everything.

249
00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:51.857
- Well. yeah. it's a good
thing to be positive.

250
00:11:00.116 --> 00:11:04.033
Not going to start this
car until you call him.

251
00:11:10.928 --> 00:11:11.885
- It's ringing.

252
00:11:11.885 --> 00:11:12.718
- Yeah.

253
00:11:16.953 --> 00:11:17.786
Is he answering?

254
00:11:17.786 --> 00:11:19.869
- It's still ring. hello?

255
00:11:20.704 --> 00:11:21.537
Hey babe.

256
00:11:23.483 --> 00:11:28.150
I kind of need to talk to you
about something important.

257
00:11:30.466 --> 00:11:33.883
Do you mind turning it off. or muting it?

258
00:11:36.988 --> 00:11:39.862
Yeah. you can turn it down.

259
00:11:39.862 --> 00:11:41.362
One notch is fine.

260
00:11:42.641 --> 00:11:45.308
Anyways. so. everything is fine.

261
00:11:46.544 --> 00:11:49.454
I just have some really exciting news.

262
00:11:49.454 --> 00:11:51.629
- Don't lie to him.

263
00:11:51.629 --> 00:11:52.462
Don't lie.

264
00:11:55.355 --> 00:11:56.605
- I'm pregnant.

265
00:12:02.723 --> 00:12:04.036
- Did he hang up?

266
00:12:04.036 --> 00:12:06.830
- No. no. it's just spotty service.

267
00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:10.247
The house has horrible service across it.

268
00:12:11.488 --> 00:12:13.098
In fact. the whole area.

269
00:12:13.098 --> 00:12:14.648
- Yeah. okay. that's fine.

270
00:12:14.648 --> 00:12:17.720
But then why isn't he calling you back?

271
00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.560
- It's the bad service. he probably

272
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.928
is trying. and it won't connect.

273
00:12:22.928 --> 00:12:25.840
- Okay. so you just gave him
like huge life-changing news.

274
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.073
and he's not trying to find a
good area to call you back in?

275
00:12:29.073 --> 00:12:31.293
- He was preoccupied. he was in his spot.

276
00:12:31.293 --> 00:12:32.626
- Oh yeah. okay.

277
00:12:33.535 --> 00:12:35.362
Well. call him back.

278
00:12:35.362 --> 00:12:36.972
- Okay.
- It connected once before.

279
00:12:36.972 --> 00:12:38.411
it should be able to connect again.

280
00:12:38.411 --> 00:12:40.466
You should be able to.

281
00:12:40.466 --> 00:12:44.516
- Well. unless the service is just iffy.

282
00:12:44.516 --> 00:12:46.016
- Yeah. we'll see.

283
00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:55.330
Sent to voicemail?

284
00:12:56.176 --> 00:12:58.661
- Yeah. it's just bad service.

285
00:12:58.661 --> 00:12:59.494
- Hmm.

286
00:13:00.703 --> 00:13:05.120
Okay. well I guess we'll
just have to go there. then.

287
00:13:11.265 --> 00:13:12.265
- I am safe.

288
00:13:15.119 --> 00:13:16.369
I am protected.

289
00:13:20.799 --> 00:13:22.632
I am going to be okay.

290
00:13:25.169 --> 00:13:26.307
I'm gonna die.

291
00:13:26.307 --> 00:13:29.559
No. I'm not gonna die. I'm fine.

292
00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:30.392
I am safe.

293
00:13:31.505 --> 00:13:33.115
Okay.

294
00:13:48.399 --> 00:13:49.608
Ethan?

295
00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:53.582
Ethan?

296
00:14:03.193 --> 00:14:04.026
No.

297
00:14:05.927 --> 00:14:06.760
No.

298
00:14:14.896 --> 00:14:15.729
Ethan?

299
00:14:18.749 --> 00:14:20.082
Ethan. I'm home.

300
00:14:22.211 --> 00:14:24.211
Why is my stuff outside?

301
00:14:25.051 --> 00:14:27.084
And this isn't everything.

302
00:14:27.084 --> 00:14:29.176
Can we please talk?

303
00:14:29.176 --> 00:14:31.261
We can work this out.

304
00:14:31.261 --> 00:14:34.874
Can you please just let
me in. and I can sit down.

305
00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:36.784
and we can talk about
this. and we can find out

306
00:14:36.784 --> 00:14:40.013
how we can make this work. please?

307
00:14:40.013 --> 00:14:43.430
I see you in there. please. can you just.

308
00:15:03.907 --> 00:15:05.731
- Are you serious?

309
00:15:21.024 --> 00:15:22.300
Okay.

310
00:15:23.263 --> 00:15:24.758
Okay.

311
00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:26.591
Where's my toothbrush?

312
00:15:35.742 --> 00:15:38.659
What am I supposed to do with this?

313
00:16:51.357 --> 00:16:52.690
- Get in. bitch.

314
00:17:04.463 --> 00:17:05.796
What's all this?

315
00:17:07.033 --> 00:17:10.283
- All this is the remnants of my stuff.

316
00:17:11.409 --> 00:17:15.492
along with globs of cat
hair from his stupid cat.

317
00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:19.425
- So. he didn't take it well?

318
00:17:19.425 --> 00:17:21.862
- No. he left this outside.

319
00:17:21.862 --> 00:17:24.636
and he freaking changed the locks.

320
00:17:24.636 --> 00:17:25.811
- He changed the locks?

321
00:17:25.811 --> 00:17:26.783
- Yes.

322
00:17:26.783 --> 00:17:28.771
- Like. already?

323
00:17:28.771 --> 00:17:29.604
Wow.

324
00:17:30.636 --> 00:17:33.719
He changed the locks in half an hour?

325
00:17:34.703 --> 00:17:37.257
I mean. even my record is 45 minutes.

326
00:17:37.257 --> 00:17:40.039
He had to have had help. there's no way.

327
00:17:40.039 --> 00:17:42.764
Okay. sorry. you're upset about this.

328
00:17:42.764 --> 00:17:44.597
Want to talk about it?

329
00:17:45.804 --> 00:17:49.137
- I have no Ethan. I have minimal stuff.

330
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:55.116
But I have a baby that somehow I'm gonna

331
00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:58.449
have to provide for. and I have nothing.

332
00:17:59.519 --> 00:18:03.276
I have to be a mother. and
I have no freaking father.

333
00:18:03.276 --> 00:18:04.342
- Fuck Ethan.

334
00:18:04.342 --> 00:18:06.443
I'll be the father of your kid.

335
00:18:06.443 --> 00:18:08.326
You don't need Ethan.

336
00:18:08.326 --> 00:18:09.659
And fuck your stuff.

337
00:18:09.659 --> 00:18:11.660
You can get new clothes and
not have to wear the things

338
00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:15.666
that you've been wearing
for the last 10 years.

339
00:18:15.666 --> 00:18:18.431
You can just completely revamp
that thing you call style.

340
00:18:20.361 --> 00:18:22.105
- I don't have money to mess around.

341
00:18:22.105 --> 00:18:25.608
I don't have money to revamp my style.

342
00:18:25.608 --> 00:18:26.988
- We're definitely taking Ethan

343
00:18:26.988 --> 00:18:29.567
to court to get you some child support.

344
00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:30.947
I think you're going to get more support

345
00:18:30.947 --> 00:18:32.988
from Ethan by taking him to court

346
00:18:32.988 --> 00:18:36.697
than you would have if he just
volunteered to be the dad.

347
00:18:36.697 --> 00:18:38.662
- I don't want to have to go to court.

348
00:18:38.662 --> 00:18:40.716
I don't want to have to do any of that.

349
00:18:40.716 --> 00:18:44.435
You know how I am in front
of big groups of people.

350
00:18:44.435 --> 00:18:46.268
- Yeah. you get gassy.

351
00:18:47.302 --> 00:18:48.707
I know that you have a lot on your mind.

352
00:18:48.707 --> 00:18:50.483
and you're probably worrying about. like.

353
00:18:50.483 --> 00:18:52.271
oh. how am I going to be a good mom

354
00:18:52.271 --> 00:18:54.457
when I can't even take care of myself.

355
00:18:54.457 --> 00:18:57.251
and I have no car. and now I'm homeless?

356
00:18:57.251 --> 00:19:00.120
- I have a lot on my mind.
I don't have all my stuff.

357
00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:05.024
let alone baby clothes. and I
don't have any place to stay.

358
00:19:05.024 --> 00:19:06.719
- You can live at my house.

359
00:19:06.719 --> 00:19:08.473
I mean. not for forever.

360
00:19:08.473 --> 00:19:11.241
I'll make some Pinboards
about how to be a good mom.

361
00:19:11.241 --> 00:19:16.018
And then maybe the two of us
together can make a great mom.

362
00:19:16.018 --> 00:19:17.615
Just remember the ground rules.

363
00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:21.324
If you see a sock on the
door. knock first. okay?

364
00:19:21.324 --> 00:19:23.436
You can come in. but warning knock.

365
00:19:23.436 --> 00:19:25.446
- Sock means knock.

366
00:19:25.446 --> 00:19:27.811
- Sock means. I'm boning.

367
00:21:48.165 --> 00:21:49.248
- Bro. oh my.

368
00:21:50.115 --> 00:21:51.782
- Oh. I am so sorry.

369
00:21:55.076 --> 00:21:56.815
- Good morning.

370
00:21:56.815 --> 00:21:57.648
- Oh.

371
00:21:59.252 --> 00:22:00.085
Coffee?

372
00:22:04.231 --> 00:22:05.805
- Yeah.

373
00:22:05.805 --> 00:22:06.722
- It's hot.

374
00:22:08.005 --> 00:22:09.366
Oh.

375
00:22:09.366 --> 00:22:10.780
- Well aware.

376
00:22:13.868 --> 00:22:16.728
Is there any cream in this?

377
00:22:16.728 --> 00:22:18.205
- No. did you want me to get you some?

378
00:22:18.205 --> 00:22:20.577
- No. I actually prefer
without. so it's good.

379
00:22:20.577 --> 00:22:23.841
Just trying to watch
the now-burning figure.

380
00:22:31.055 --> 00:22:32.472
- It's Ethiopian.

381
00:22:33.951 --> 00:22:36.128
- It was nice to meet you.

382
00:22:36.128 --> 00:22:37.375
- Yeah.

383
00:22:37.375 --> 00:22:40.208
- Listen. I'm just gonna head out.

384
00:22:41.565 --> 00:22:42.565
- Okay.
- It was nice meeting you.

385
00:22:42.565 --> 00:22:43.648
- Yeah. yeah.

386
00:22:45.912 --> 00:22:47.495
- Just tell Sandra.

387
00:22:51.778 --> 00:22:53.141
I'll bring the cup back.

388
00:22:53.141 --> 00:22:54.165
- Oh. that's nice of you.

389
00:22:54.165 --> 00:22:55.615
Yeah. yeah.

390
00:22:55.615 --> 00:22:57.591
- Do you want pants?

391
00:22:57.591 --> 00:22:58.840
It's cold outside.

392
00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.423
- I prefer without.

393
00:23:25.677 --> 00:23:27.868
- That coffee looks so good.

394
00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:35.632
It's perfect.

395
00:23:38.506 --> 00:23:39.756
- Who was that?

396
00:23:41.123 --> 00:23:42.235
- Who was what?

397
00:23:42.235 --> 00:23:43.068
- The guy?

398
00:23:45.263 --> 00:23:46.180
- What guy?

399
00:23:48.179 --> 00:23:49.762
- The man. the boy.

400
00:23:50.867 --> 00:23:52.534
- Oh. the boy. yeah.

401
00:23:54.106 --> 00:23:56.685
After you fell asleep
last night. I got bored.

402
00:23:56.685 --> 00:24:00.826
and so I went over to
one of the frat parties.

403
00:24:00.826 --> 00:24:03.968
and I found this cute little boy.

404
00:24:03.968 --> 00:24:05.051
He's so dumb.

405
00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:08.304
So adorable.

406
00:24:08.304 --> 00:24:09.971
- What was his name?

407
00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:12.477
- Oh. good question.

408
00:24:14.371 --> 00:24:15.204
Craig?

409
00:24:16.243 --> 00:24:18.704
- Oh.
- No. definitely not Craig.

410
00:24:18.704 --> 00:24:19.621
Oh. Carlos.

411
00:24:22.208 --> 00:24:25.041
Definitely. probably Carlos. yeah.

412
00:24:26.227 --> 00:24:29.264
- Definitely looked like a Carlos.

413
00:24:29.264 --> 00:24:32.981
I've been thinking. and
really. I need to make sure

414
00:24:32.981 --> 00:24:35.948
that you know how much I appreciate you.

415
00:24:35.948 --> 00:24:40.615
I don't know where I'd be if
I wasn't able to stay here.

416
00:24:42.067 --> 00:24:45.235
So. thank you so much for
letting me crash here.

417
00:24:45.235 --> 00:24:48.573
- You can stay for as
long as you need to. okay?

418
00:24:48.573 --> 00:24:49.406
- You're amazing.

419
00:24:49.406 --> 00:24:51.656
- But rent is due tomorrow.

420
00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.342
So. if you could help out any way

421
00:24:57.342 --> 00:24:59.886
that you could with that.
that'd be great. 'kay?

422
00:24:59.886 --> 00:25:01.446
- Oh. definitely.

423
00:25:01.446 --> 00:25:03.008
- Rent's $700. so if we could just

424
00:25:03.008 --> 00:25:05.764
cut it right down the
middle. that'd be great.

425
00:25:05.764 --> 00:25:07.603
If you need me to drive you to an ATM.

426
00:25:07.603 --> 00:25:10.603
or something. I can totally do that.

427
00:25:11.613 --> 00:25:13.946
- Definitely. I can do that.

428
00:25:14.973 --> 00:25:16.591
- Thank you so much for offering.

429
00:25:16.591 --> 00:25:18.342
- Oh. no problem.

430
00:25:18.342 --> 00:25:19.759
- It means a lot.

431
00:25:22.291 --> 00:25:23.853
Ooo. that's hot.

432
00:25:23.853 --> 00:25:27.187
So. are you still really
bummed out. really sad?

433
00:25:27.187 --> 00:25:30.963
- I wouldn't call it sad at this point.

434
00:25:30.963 --> 00:25:35.963
Just. every time I think of
him. and I picture his face.

435
00:25:36.314 --> 00:25:40.564
there's just this knot.
like a deep. visceral knot.

436
00:25:41.825 --> 00:25:44.451
And then. I start thinking more about him.

437
00:25:44.451 --> 00:25:46.176
and then it just gets tighter.

438
00:25:46.176 --> 00:25:48.086
- You're pissed off?

439
00:25:48.086 --> 00:25:48.919
- Yeah.

440
00:25:49.936 --> 00:25:51.555
Yeah. I'm pissed off.

441
00:25:51.555 --> 00:25:52.720
What kind of person?

442
00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.579
I mean. I understand commitment problems

443
00:25:54.579 --> 00:25:56.330
and getting cold feet. maybe-

444
00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:58.413
- No. I don't understand.

445
00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:01.428
- But a child?

446
00:26:01.428 --> 00:26:02.678
It's his child.

447
00:26:03.714 --> 00:26:05.629
I don't like feeling like this.

448
00:26:05.629 --> 00:26:07.392
I don't like feeling like this at all.

449
00:26:07.392 --> 00:26:08.808
- You don't deserve it.

450
00:26:08.808 --> 00:26:10.381
- No. I don't deserve it.

451
00:26:10.381 --> 00:26:11.306
You know who deserves it?

452
00:26:11.306 --> 00:26:12.301
He deserves it.

453
00:26:12.301 --> 00:26:14.390
- He deserves to feel this way.

454
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:16.346
- He needs to feel all the pain.

455
00:26:16.346 --> 00:26:18.661
He needs to feel the frustration.

456
00:26:18.661 --> 00:26:20.342
He needs to miss me.

457
00:26:20.342 --> 00:26:21.175
- Yeah.

458
00:26:21.175 --> 00:26:23.192
- I want him to feel this way.

459
00:26:23.192 --> 00:26:26.890
- Yeah. if only there was
something we could do.

460
00:26:30.755 --> 00:26:32.469
- Oh. we should get back at him.

461
00:26:32.469 --> 00:26:34.810
- Oh my gosh. what a good idea.

462
00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:36.394
- We should totally get back at him.

463
00:26:36.394 --> 00:26:38.394
- Yeah. that'd be great.

464
00:26:39.971 --> 00:26:42.525
But what could we do?

465
00:26:42.525 --> 00:26:46.618
- I could go to his house.
I could kink his hose.

466
00:26:46.618 --> 00:26:51.464
and then he wouldn't be
able to water his plants.

467
00:26:51.464 --> 00:26:54.261
- Yeah. but we don't want to
punish the plants. Autumn.

468
00:26:54.261 --> 00:26:56.218
Are you a monster?

469
00:26:56.218 --> 00:26:57.213
- No.

470
00:26:57.213 --> 00:26:59.254
- They didn't do anything.

471
00:26:59.254 --> 00:27:03.171
- We can write. you are
a terrible human being.

472
00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:06.693
and then stick it on his car windshield.

473
00:27:06.693 --> 00:27:09.548
And then. he'll read
it and internalize it.

474
00:27:09.548 --> 00:27:10.870
- No. do this one again.

475
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:11.703
- Sorry.

476
00:27:12.635 --> 00:27:14.000
More jelly?

477
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.248
- To the edges. Autumn.

478
00:27:15.248 --> 00:27:16.736
- Oh.

479
00:27:16.736 --> 00:27:17.958
- God.

480
00:27:17.958 --> 00:27:18.810
- More surface area.

481
00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:20.726
- We're human beings.

482
00:27:20.726 --> 00:27:22.218
- Yeah.

483
00:27:22.218 --> 00:27:24.486
- I like your idea of
the whole note thing.

484
00:27:24.486 --> 00:27:27.258
What if we write a note of him

485
00:27:27.258 --> 00:27:30.258
threatening to bomb the White House?

486
00:27:31.792 --> 00:27:33.258
- Stacy.

487
00:27:33.258 --> 00:27:35.463
- Wouldn't it be funny?

488
00:27:35.463 --> 00:27:38.297
We could frame him for a cold-case murder.

489
00:27:38.297 --> 00:27:42.380
and then we can call the
police and tip them off.

490
00:27:44.563 --> 00:27:45.396
- No?

491
00:27:46.264 --> 00:27:47.485
Oh. I don't know what
you're going for here.

492
00:27:47.485 --> 00:27:49.914
because I keep coming up
with all these great ideas

493
00:27:49.914 --> 00:27:52.085
and you keep just shooting them down.

494
00:27:52.085 --> 00:27:53.312
- I need to make him jealous.

495
00:27:53.312 --> 00:27:55.087
- Yeah. okay.

496
00:27:55.087 --> 00:27:56.323
- Tinder.

497
00:27:56.323 --> 00:27:59.073
I can make a fake Tinder profile.

498
00:28:00.426 --> 00:28:04.612
He would see me. and then he
would think I have moved on.

499
00:28:04.612 --> 00:28:07.889
- Yeah. that'd be so badass and hardcore.

500
00:28:07.889 --> 00:28:11.203
What if. oh my god. Autumn. seriously.

501
00:28:11.203 --> 00:28:12.787
Can you pay attention to this?

502
00:28:12.787 --> 00:28:14.275
This is meal prep for me. this is my lunch

503
00:28:14.275 --> 00:28:16.900
for the week. and you're
gonna ruin it for me.

504
00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:17.733
- I'm sorry.

505
00:28:17.733 --> 00:28:21.233
- I'm not gonna enjoy eating
these sandwiches at all.

506
00:28:21.233 --> 00:28:24.954
- I could call his mom.
and I could tell her

507
00:28:24.954 --> 00:28:28.588
that he's been using her credit card.

508
00:28:28.588 --> 00:28:29.959
- I'm feeding off of your energy.

509
00:28:29.959 --> 00:28:31.021
think we're going in the same direction.

510
00:28:31.021 --> 00:28:32.266
- Okay.

511
00:28:32.266 --> 00:28:34.835
- So. we open a bunch of credit cards

512
00:28:34.835 --> 00:28:38.085
in his name. and then max them all out.

513
00:28:40.437 --> 00:28:41.485
- Okay.
- Right?

514
00:28:41.485 --> 00:28:42.406
- Maybe.

515
00:28:42.406 --> 00:28:44.077
No. because then he would never

516
00:28:44.077 --> 00:28:46.545
be able to have another house.

517
00:28:46.545 --> 00:28:47.378
- So?

518
00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:53.254
- No.

519
00:28:53.254 --> 00:28:56.208
- Hear me out because
this one. we could run

520
00:28:56.208 --> 00:29:01.187
into some snags. but we
upload a bunch of kiddie porn

521
00:29:01.187 --> 00:29:03.844
onto Ethan's computer at work.

522
00:29:04.677 --> 00:29:06.767
And then. we tip the boss.
or something like that.

523
00:29:06.767 --> 00:29:08.350
And then. they find it. and then he goes

524
00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:09.936
to jail for a really long time.

525
00:29:09.936 --> 00:29:12.710
And then. everybody knows
what a douchebag is.

526
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:17.366
We'd be exposing the IP
address of the kiddie porn.

527
00:29:17.366 --> 00:29:18.685
Do you like it?

528
00:29:18.685 --> 00:29:19.518
- Oh.

529
00:29:20.474 --> 00:29:21.307
Yeah.

530
00:29:22.154 --> 00:29:23.987
- Okay. so. you're in?

531
00:29:25.814 --> 00:29:27.421
You're in with the kiddie porn?

532
00:29:27.421 --> 00:29:28.379
- No.

533
00:29:28.379 --> 00:29:29.212
No. no.

534
00:29:32.273 --> 00:29:36.619
- I guess all my ideas are
just too hardcore for you.

535
00:29:36.619 --> 00:29:39.119
- Actually. I do have an idea.

536
00:29:40.759 --> 00:29:43.867
You need to start checking your pockets.

537
00:29:43.867 --> 00:29:46.362
- Oh forgot I had this.

538
00:29:53.403 --> 00:29:54.320
- Oh. shit.

539
00:29:55.339 --> 00:29:56.172
- What?

540
00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:59.700
- My grandma's necklace.

541
00:30:01.361 --> 00:30:02.334
- What about it?

542
00:30:02.334 --> 00:30:04.075
- It's at Ethan's.

543
00:30:04.075 --> 00:30:04.908
- Oh.

544
00:30:04.908 --> 00:30:07.455
- It's the frickin' family heirloom.

545
00:30:07.455 --> 00:30:09.342
She would turn over in her grave

546
00:30:09.342 --> 00:30:11.934
if she knew that I lost that thing.

547
00:30:11.934 --> 00:30:15.233
- You haven't lost it.
you know where it is.

548
00:30:15.233 --> 00:30:16.806
- I'm gonna have to go back and get it.

549
00:30:16.806 --> 00:30:17.729
- No.

550
00:30:17.729 --> 00:30:19.518
So. you're just going
to go back over there

551
00:30:19.518 --> 00:30:22.616
and ask him to give you back the necklace?

552
00:30:22.616 --> 00:30:26.168
- Yeah. I'll have to go
back and and see him.

553
00:30:26.168 --> 00:30:27.787
- You are not ready to see him.

554
00:30:27.787 --> 00:30:30.246
- No. I think that would be good.

555
00:30:30.246 --> 00:30:32.622
- Let's just go ahead and role
play that real quick. okay?

556
00:30:32.622 --> 00:30:34.184
I'm going to be Ethan. 'kay?

557
00:30:34.184 --> 00:30:35.454
You ready?

558
00:30:35.454 --> 00:30:36.677
Ready. we're gonna role play?

559
00:30:36.677 --> 00:30:39.137
- Okay.
- All right.

560
00:30:39.137 --> 00:30:42.315
Oh. hey. what's up. baby mama?

561
00:30:42.315 --> 00:30:46.001
I was just jerking off.
'cause I'm a douchebag.

562
00:30:46.001 --> 00:30:49.696
and. big surprise girl. I miss you.

563
00:30:49.696 --> 00:30:54.696
and I want to try to work
on things and have a family.

564
00:30:54.833 --> 00:30:55.916
- Oh. my god.

565
00:30:56.888 --> 00:30:58.784
You think he'll want me back?

566
00:30:58.784 --> 00:30:59.617
What?

567
00:30:59.617 --> 00:31:00.450
No.

568
00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:01.703
- No. this would be perfect.

569
00:31:01.703 --> 00:31:03.268
He needs to be able to see me again.

570
00:31:03.268 --> 00:31:05.162
'cause that's what it is.
that's what's missing.

571
00:31:05.162 --> 00:31:07.633
He needs to see me right there.

572
00:31:07.633 --> 00:31:09.364
in person. in the same space as him.

573
00:31:09.364 --> 00:31:11.930
Then. he's gonna miss me.
and then he'll want me-

574
00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:13.922
- No. you don't want him back.

575
00:31:13.922 --> 00:31:16.010
We should just go get it back.

576
00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:17.197
Just go into the house when he's

577
00:31:17.197 --> 00:31:19.396
not home and just get it back.

578
00:31:19.396 --> 00:31:22.323
- That's breaking and entering.

579
00:31:22.323 --> 00:31:23.882
- No. You used to live there.

580
00:31:23.882 --> 00:31:24.715
- I used to.

581
00:31:24.715 --> 00:31:25.984
- So. just because he changed the locks.

582
00:31:25.984 --> 00:31:27.568
you don't live there anymore?

583
00:31:27.568 --> 00:31:28.401
- Yes.

584
00:31:29.236 --> 00:31:33.841
- This could be the perfect
way to get back at him.

585
00:31:33.841 --> 00:31:34.912
- Breaking in?

586
00:31:34.912 --> 00:31:37.223
- He loses all his stuff. there's
no way to trace it back to

587
00:31:37.223 --> 00:31:41.114
you. because mine and your DNA
is all over the place anyway.

588
00:31:41.114 --> 00:31:43.024
So. even if they did forensics.

589
00:31:43.024 --> 00:31:46.249
- Wait. why's your DNA all over there?

590
00:31:46.249 --> 00:31:47.219
- 'Cause I would hang out with you

591
00:31:47.219 --> 00:31:50.685
all the time. and I'm
a really bad shedder.

592
00:31:50.685 --> 00:31:51.968
- Yes.

593
00:31:51.968 --> 00:31:54.656
- When he's at work.
we'll sneak over there.

594
00:31:54.656 --> 00:31:56.804
and then we can use my heist kit.

595
00:31:56.804 --> 00:31:57.637
- A heist?

596
00:31:57.637 --> 00:31:59.552
No. no.
- And make it

597
00:31:59.552 --> 00:32:02.052
look like no one ever came in.

598
00:32:03.466 --> 00:32:06.153
- He does owe me a lot of money.

599
00:32:06.153 --> 00:32:07.053
He kicked me out. and he owes me

600
00:32:07.053 --> 00:32:09.137
a shit-ton of money. and
he's got my necklace.

601
00:32:12.272 --> 00:32:16.762
- What if we tunnel up
through the fireplace.

602
00:32:16.762 --> 00:32:19.101
and then come out when he's not home.

603
00:32:19.101 --> 00:32:20.554
and then it's like we were never there.

604
00:32:20.554 --> 00:32:22.426
And then. if we ever need to come back.

605
00:32:22.426 --> 00:32:25.207
we have a perfectly good working tunnel.

606
00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.468
- You don't like any of my ideas.

607
00:32:28.468 --> 00:32:31.549
Okay. this one. I think you'll like.

608
00:32:31.549 --> 00:32:34.586
So. we get a jackhammer.
jackhammer has septic tank

609
00:32:34.586 --> 00:32:35.581
so shit just comes.

610
00:32:36.414 --> 00:32:37.777
out of the ground.

611
00:32:37.777 --> 00:32:40.660
Ethan runs out like. oh
no. what's happening?

612
00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:43.828
And then. we sneak in the
back door. get what we need.

613
00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.949
We were never there.

614
00:32:45.949 --> 00:32:46.935
- Stacy.

615
00:32:46.935 --> 00:32:47.768
- What?

616
00:32:49.239 --> 00:32:50.522
I mean. it's probably going to be gross.

617
00:32:50.522 --> 00:32:51.760
but we'll wear hazmat suits.

618
00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:55.239
- Where are you getting all these ideas?

619
00:32:55.239 --> 00:32:59.248
- Oh. I have a whole Pinboard
on how to do a heist.

620
00:32:59.248 --> 00:33:03.205
- All these ideas are on the internet.

621
00:33:03.205 --> 00:33:05.402
associated with your name.

622
00:33:05.402 --> 00:33:07.312
- Yeah. that's what a Pinboard is.

623
00:33:07.312 --> 00:33:08.305
- You know the government's gonna

624
00:33:08.305 --> 00:33:10.000
start tracking your Pinboard.

625
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:10.833
You gotta be careful.

626
00:33:11.865 --> 00:33:14.948
- That's why I named it. Not A Heist.

627
00:33:15.875 --> 00:33:16.708
Duh.

628
00:33:16.708 --> 00:33:19.113
- All right. thank you all so much

629
00:33:19.113 --> 00:33:22.233
for coming to my weekend workshop.

630
00:33:22.233 --> 00:33:24.681
If you've done any
research. then you will know

631
00:33:24.681 --> 00:33:27.264
that I am Geoffrey LeMaze III.

632
00:33:28.403 --> 00:33:31.075
- You're the founder of
this. it's named after you.

633
00:33:31.075 --> 00:33:35.242
- I am the great-great
grandson of Geoffrey LeMaze.

634
00:33:36.248 --> 00:33:39.596
So. this class is a little bit different.

635
00:33:39.596 --> 00:33:41.564
This is a Lamaze class.

636
00:33:41.564 --> 00:33:43.414
You all have a little being inside of you.

637
00:33:43.414 --> 00:33:45.402
and they're lost. and
they are just searchin'.

638
00:33:45.402 --> 00:33:48.275
wall-to-wall. tryin' to get out of there.

639
00:33:48.275 --> 00:33:51.644
They're in a little maze. I like to say.

640
00:33:51.644 --> 00:33:53.468
So. we're going to assist with that.

641
00:33:53.468 --> 00:33:55.702
We're going to help him or her

642
00:33:55.702 --> 00:33:58.535
find their way out of your vagine.

643
00:34:01.708 --> 00:34:02.704
How far along are you?

644
00:34:02.704 --> 00:34:03.888
You are glowing.

645
00:34:05.676 --> 00:34:07.139
- Thanks. I'm not even pregnant.

646
00:34:07.139 --> 00:34:09.337
That's just my natural glow.

647
00:34:09.337 --> 00:34:10.811
- Really?

648
00:34:10.811 --> 00:34:12.106
Wow.

649
00:34:12.106 --> 00:34:13.501
'Cause I'm feeling something.

650
00:34:14.334 --> 00:34:15.232
- She brought me.

651
00:34:15.232 --> 00:34:16.720
I'm pregnant.

652
00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:17.970
- You're. okay.

653
00:34:19.842 --> 00:34:20.925
That's great.

654
00:34:22.038 --> 00:34:24.184
What about over here?

655
00:34:24.184 --> 00:34:25.017
- Number four.

656
00:34:25.017 --> 00:34:26.310
What?

657
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:27.683
- Let's go ahead and get started

658
00:34:27.683 --> 00:34:30.032
on these breathing exercises. okay?

659
00:34:30.032 --> 00:34:33.949
Let's start with the
standard in and out. okay?

660
00:34:37.881 --> 00:34:38.714
And out.

661
00:34:43.184 --> 00:34:45.644
Good god. woman. you
sound like a horror movie.

662
00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:48.576
In and out.

663
00:34:50.083 --> 00:34:51.542
You are doing great.

664
00:34:52.649 --> 00:34:54.666
- She's usually like
a really slow learner.

665
00:34:54.666 --> 00:34:56.889
She got teased a lot in
middle school about it.

666
00:34:56.889 --> 00:34:59.174
- Yeah. that's always rough.

667
00:34:59.174 --> 00:35:02.739
- If you tell me the duration
that I need to inhale.

668
00:35:02.739 --> 00:35:04.127
and then if I need to hold it.

669
00:35:04.127 --> 00:35:06.431
do I hold it. does that affect anything?

670
00:35:06.431 --> 00:35:08.867
- You're thinking too
much. you're stressing out.

671
00:35:08.867 --> 00:35:10.452
I see stress all around you.

672
00:35:10.452 --> 00:35:11.285
- Yes.

673
00:35:11.285 --> 00:35:12.636
- You need to just relax.

674
00:35:12.636 --> 00:35:14.543
Just feel the breathing.

675
00:35:14.543 --> 00:35:16.981
It's very natural to breathe. am I right?

676
00:35:16.981 --> 00:35:18.888
- Yes.
- Yes. yes.

677
00:35:18.888 --> 00:35:19.848
Very good.

678
00:35:19.848 --> 00:35:21.311
You know. I would think he's pregnant.

679
00:35:23.352 --> 00:35:27.013
Those who are expecting. let's
get in position. and those

680
00:35:27.013 --> 00:35:29.916
who are supporting. let's get
in our supporting position.

681
00:35:29.916 --> 00:35:31.749
- What's the position?

682
00:35:32.892 --> 00:35:34.520
- You are just full of questions.

683
00:35:35.548 --> 00:35:38.677
Go ahead and sit in front
of your partner over here.

684
00:35:38.677 --> 00:35:39.623
- Like?

685
00:35:39.623 --> 00:35:41.797
- Just like everybody else in the group.

686
00:35:41.797 --> 00:35:43.788
You just swung right over.

687
00:35:43.788 --> 00:35:47.592
Now. we are going to do.
it's pretty advanced.

688
00:35:47.592 --> 00:35:48.799
We are going to act like you're

689
00:35:48.799 --> 00:35:50.831
actually having the baby. okay?

690
00:35:50.831 --> 00:35:54.108
I can tell there's just
bad energy over here.

691
00:35:54.108 --> 00:35:57.384
I'm not feeling like you're pregnant.

692
00:35:58.392 --> 00:35:59.256
- Bad energy?

693
00:35:59.256 --> 00:36:02.629
- You focus on all the bad
words. even right there.

694
00:36:02.629 --> 00:36:03.462
Yes.

695
00:36:03.462 --> 00:36:06.144
- I mean. in her defense.
she's gonna have to raise

696
00:36:06.144 --> 00:36:09.622
this baby all alone. because
she's an unwed single mother.

697
00:36:10.455 --> 00:36:11.288
- Ew.

698
00:36:11.288 --> 00:36:12.367
Just do better. that's all.

699
00:36:12.367 --> 00:36:13.986
That's all I'm saying. just do better.

700
00:36:13.986 --> 00:36:14.888
What is your name?

701
00:36:14.888 --> 00:36:15.896
- My name is Stacy.

702
00:36:15.896 --> 00:36:18.812
- You are such a supportive friend.

703
00:36:18.812 --> 00:36:20.600
I wish I was your friend.

704
00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:22.210
Go and get a nice and relaxed.

705
00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:26.620
It's time. the baby's coming.
I'm coming. Stacy's coming.

706
00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:27.453
Now.

707
00:36:28.597 --> 00:36:29.430
breathe.

708
00:36:32.599 --> 00:36:33.432
In.

709
00:36:35.189 --> 00:36:36.380
Out.

710
00:36:39.442 --> 00:36:41.170
Do you want to have the baby?

711
00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:42.003
I think so.

712
00:36:42.003 --> 00:36:43.158
- Do you want a baby?

713
00:36:43.158 --> 00:36:43.991
No.

714
00:36:43.991 --> 00:36:45.602
- Yes. the answer is yes. you're here.

715
00:36:46.572 --> 00:36:47.954
You need to calm down. okay?

716
00:36:47.954 --> 00:36:49.481
Calm down. no crying.

717
00:36:52.482 --> 00:36:55.852
Now. push without pushing.
do you understand me?

718
00:36:55.852 --> 00:36:56.685
- Yeah.

719
00:36:56.685 --> 00:36:57.518
- Push.

720
00:36:59.301 --> 00:37:00.509
- Autumn. do it.

721
00:37:00.509 --> 00:37:01.759
- Autumn. push.

722
00:37:02.982 --> 00:37:04.050
- Without pushing.

723
00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:06.594
- Come on. let's go. more. more push.

724
00:37:06.594 --> 00:37:08.166
It's coming. it's coming.

725
00:37:08.166 --> 00:37:09.083
Oh. my god.

726
00:37:11.887 --> 00:37:14.137
It's a beautiful dead baby.

727
00:37:15.631 --> 00:37:19.471
You killed the baby
because you do not care.

728
00:37:19.471 --> 00:37:22.230
You don't want to LeMaze.

729
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:24.230
He got lost and he died.

730
00:37:25.567 --> 00:37:27.055
Get out.

731
00:37:27.055 --> 00:37:28.222
- What?
- Out.

732
00:37:29.537 --> 00:37:30.454
- Okay. go.

733
00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:34.611
Come back when
you're ready to have a child.

734
00:37:34.611 --> 00:37:36.448
- That was bullshit.

735
00:37:36.448 --> 00:37:38.531
- Autumn. you never cuss.

736
00:37:41.344 --> 00:37:42.627
- Sorry.

737
00:37:42.627 --> 00:37:44.403
- I know. I have only
been that embarrassed.

738
00:37:44.403 --> 00:37:46.404
like. five times in my life.

739
00:37:46.404 --> 00:37:48.145
- That was not on me.

740
00:37:48.145 --> 00:37:49.840
That was not on me.

741
00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:53.402
I can't believe that I would
be kicked out of something.

742
00:37:53.402 --> 00:37:55.766
He's so fucking weird.

743
00:37:55.766 --> 00:37:59.402
- Well. yeah. I mean. he's a genius.

744
00:37:59.402 --> 00:38:02.426
Of course. he's going to
be a little eccentric.

745
00:38:02.426 --> 00:38:04.355
Look. everyone else that goes to him

746
00:38:04.355 --> 00:38:07.538
is able to have a
basically-painless birth.

747
00:38:07.538 --> 00:38:09.267
and you got kicked out of the class.

748
00:38:09.267 --> 00:38:11.198
and you think it's a problem with him?

749
00:38:11.198 --> 00:38:14.365
- Wait. Stacy. do you think it was me?

750
00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:20.656
Well. I mean. I don't
think you were the issue.

751
00:38:20.656 --> 00:38:21.990
I just don't think maybe you were

752
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:23.674
trying as hard as you could have?

753
00:38:23.674 --> 00:38:26.591
- Oh. my god. so I was the problem.

754
00:38:28.161 --> 00:38:29.480
- Well. I mean. yeah.

755
00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:30.801
- Well. I'm glad I'm asking you.

756
00:38:30.801 --> 00:38:33.847
'cause I guess I was
being really one-sided.

757
00:38:33.847 --> 00:38:37.401
- It seemed like you kind
of had a negative attitude.

758
00:38:37.401 --> 00:38:38.722
- Oh. my god.

759
00:38:38.722 --> 00:38:39.972
I was negative.

760
00:38:40.899 --> 00:38:42.149
I was negative.

761
00:38:43.664 --> 00:38:45.850
What if the negativity is coming

762
00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:50.206
from the 50% Ethan demon inside of me?

763
00:38:50.206 --> 00:38:54.122
That's making me negative
and messing with my brain?

764
00:38:54.122 --> 00:38:57.510
Hormones suck during pregnancy.
but what if it's even worse.

765
00:38:57.510 --> 00:39:01.326
because the chromosomes are from Ethan?

766
00:39:01.326 --> 00:39:03.096
- Yeah. definitely.

767
00:39:03.096 --> 00:39:06.134
I'm no scientist. but I would
say that that's verifiable.

768
00:39:06.134 --> 00:39:07.692
- Oh. god.

769
00:39:11.251 --> 00:39:13.495
This is going to ruin my brain chemistry

770
00:39:13.495 --> 00:39:16.003
and. potentially. all my relationships.

771
00:39:16.003 --> 00:39:16.836
- Oh yeah.

772
00:39:16.836 --> 00:39:18.616
- This baby is a parasite.

773
00:39:18.616 --> 00:39:19.449
- What?

774
00:39:20.451 --> 00:39:25.201
Autumn. your baby's a blessing.
even if it is from Ethan.

775
00:39:26.927 --> 00:39:29.270
No. don't cry again.

776
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:30.383
Don't.

777
00:39:30.383 --> 00:39:33.771
Please. don't cry again. please don't.

778
00:39:33.771 --> 00:39:35.438
- I'm a terrible mom

779
00:39:36.279 --> 00:39:37.567
- What. no.

780
00:39:37.567 --> 00:39:40.006
- I called my baby a parasite.

781
00:39:40.006 --> 00:39:41.911
- No. you're not a terrible mother. yet.

782
00:39:41.911 --> 00:39:43.603
We don't know that yet.

783
00:39:43.603 --> 00:39:46.024
I mean. you're a terrible
pregnant lady so far.

784
00:39:46.024 --> 00:39:47.883
- I'm a horrible pregnant lady.

785
00:39:47.883 --> 00:39:51.714
- Look. that's why we're
taking these classes. okay?

786
00:39:51.714 --> 00:39:52.675
You don't need to be a good mom yet.

787
00:39:52.675 --> 00:39:54.127
That's why you have nine months.

788
00:39:54.127 --> 00:39:55.365
- Oh. god.

789
00:39:55.365 --> 00:39:56.995
Nine months. okay.

790
00:39:56.995 --> 00:39:58.973
I need to distract myself right now.

791
00:39:58.973 --> 00:40:00.766
I don't want to think about anything.

792
00:40:00.766 --> 00:40:02.541
- And you need to stop
feeling like you're alone.

793
00:40:02.541 --> 00:40:04.386
Remember. I am here with you.

794
00:40:04.386 --> 00:40:06.368
What did we used to talk
about before the pregnancy?

795
00:40:06.368 --> 00:40:07.731
- Not LeMaze.

796
00:40:07.731 --> 00:40:09.777
- Oh. that gun. I'm
going to get a new gun.

797
00:40:09.777 --> 00:40:11.751
It's going to be like. brat-tat-tat-tat.

798
00:40:11.751 --> 00:40:13.584
It's gonna be so cool.

799
00:40:15.547 --> 00:40:19.134
Well. anyways. what you need
to do is just focus on the baby

800
00:40:19.134 --> 00:40:21.378
and stop worrying so much about yourself.

801
00:40:21.378 --> 00:40:24.127
stop worrying about Ethan.

802
00:40:24.127 --> 00:40:25.435
What's wrong?

803
00:40:25.435 --> 00:40:26.268
- What?

804
00:40:27.416 --> 00:40:28.249
- What?

805
00:40:29.152 --> 00:40:29.985
- What?

806
00:40:30.946 --> 00:40:32.299
What

807
00:40:32.299 --> 00:40:33.132
the fuck!

808
00:40:37.291 --> 00:40:39.842
He's in a relationship.

809
00:40:39.842 --> 00:40:42.093
Ethan is in a relationship?

810
00:40:42.093 --> 00:40:43.926
- That son of a bitch.

811
00:40:45.576 --> 00:40:46.576
- That's it.

812
00:40:47.523 --> 00:40:49.040
He's nuts.

813
00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:51.027
No. we're doing this fucking heist.

814
00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:53.626
- Really. you promise?

815
00:40:53.626 --> 00:40:55.099
- He's not getting away with it.

816
00:40:55.099 --> 00:40:56.276
Let's do this.

817
00:40:56.276 --> 00:40:59.895
- Yeah. let's go fuck his shit up.

818
00:40:59.895 --> 00:41:02.095
Oh my gosh. I almost forgot.

819
00:41:02.095 --> 00:41:03.087
- What?

820
00:41:03.087 --> 00:41:06.321
- There's a rager happening tonight.

821
00:41:06.321 --> 00:41:07.154
- A rager?

822
00:41:08.223 --> 00:41:09.379
- A party.

823
00:41:09.379 --> 00:41:11.236
A shindig. a fiesta.
- Oh.

824
00:41:11.236 --> 00:41:15.687
So. you want to do that
tonight instead of the heist?

825
00:41:15.687 --> 00:41:16.520
- What?

826
00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:17.353
No.

827
00:41:18.503 --> 00:41:20.446
The party will be our alibi.

828
00:41:20.446 --> 00:41:21.279
- Oh.

829
00:41:23.394 --> 00:41:24.894
I'm not following.

830
00:41:26.242 --> 00:41:27.711
- Okay. we go to this party.

831
00:41:27.711 --> 00:41:29.035
Okay.

832
00:41:29.035 --> 00:41:30.408
- We get into as many selfies

833
00:41:30.408 --> 00:41:32.684
as we can. get on people's stories.

834
00:41:32.684 --> 00:41:35.753
then we slip out. go do
the heist. come back.

835
00:41:35.753 --> 00:41:40.108
get documented again. and
it's like. we were never gone.

836
00:41:40.108 --> 00:41:41.153
- Oh. my god.

837
00:41:41.153 --> 00:41:42.782
So. they think we're at the party.

838
00:41:42.782 --> 00:41:44.871
- 'Cause we're actually
gonna be at the party.

839
00:41:44.871 --> 00:41:46.753
- Oh my god. so it's not a lie.

840
00:41:46.753 --> 00:41:48.801
- We can even leave our
phones at the party.

841
00:41:48.801 --> 00:41:51.573
so that way there's no
accessing our location.

842
00:41:51.573 --> 00:41:54.837
- No tracking location. I
like that. that's smart.

843
00:41:54.837 --> 00:41:57.565
This is almost perfect.

844
00:41:57.565 --> 00:41:58.619
One problem.

845
00:41:58.619 --> 00:42:00.965
I have no idea what Ethan's doing tonight.

846
00:42:00.965 --> 00:42:04.331
He might be working. but
I have no idea what time.

847
00:42:04.331 --> 00:42:06.421
- Let me just find the number.

848
00:42:06.421 --> 00:42:07.709
All right.

849
00:42:10.803 --> 00:42:11.636
- Hello?

850
00:42:12.779 --> 00:42:15.779
Hi. yeah this is Ethan's girlfriend.

851
00:42:17.156 --> 00:42:19.067
He's not answering his phone.

852
00:42:19.067 --> 00:42:20.927
I just need to get ahold of him.

853
00:42:20.927 --> 00:42:25.084
So. I was wondering if
he was working right now?

854
00:42:25.084 --> 00:42:27.729
Oh. he's not working 'til five?

855
00:42:27.729 --> 00:42:30.348
That's right. I totally forgot.

856
00:42:30.348 --> 00:42:32.722
Now I remember. yeah. he told me that

857
00:42:32.722 --> 00:42:35.222
earlier when we were together.

858
00:42:36.133 --> 00:42:36.966
'Til 10?

859
00:42:37.993 --> 00:42:40.677
All right. thank you so much. Pamela.

860
00:42:40.677 --> 00:42:41.510
Bye.

861
00:42:42.941 --> 00:42:47.189
Now. all we need to do is
get into our heist outfits.

862
00:42:49.582 --> 00:42:51.237
- I have some really good options

863
00:42:51.237 --> 00:42:52.909
that I think you will approve of.

864
00:42:52.909 --> 00:42:56.240
It's this power suit-esque-type style.

865
00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:58.781
Also really good on my curves.

866
00:42:58.781 --> 00:43:00.488
- Okay. it looks like you're gonna be

867
00:43:00.488 --> 00:43:03.450
a Catholic school girl. so no.

868
00:43:04.283 --> 00:43:05.937
Next.

869
00:43:05.937 --> 00:43:09.169
- Okay. so this next one. hear me out.

870
00:43:09.169 --> 00:43:10.313
- Okay.

871
00:43:10.313 --> 00:43:13.217
- This one is super important
to me. and I think it'll bring

872
00:43:13.217 --> 00:43:17.131
a really great supportive
energy with me on this heist.

873
00:43:17.131 --> 00:43:18.143
- Okay. can you just show it to me?

874
00:43:18.143 --> 00:43:19.102
- Yes.
- Right now. I feel like

875
00:43:19.102 --> 00:43:20.081
I'm looking up a recipe.

876
00:43:20.081 --> 00:43:21.697
- No. okay.

877
00:43:21.697 --> 00:43:23.877
So. my mom gave this to me when I was-

878
00:43:23.877 --> 00:43:24.909
- No. mom?

879
00:43:24.909 --> 00:43:25.919
No. god no.

880
00:43:25.919 --> 00:43:27.293
I hate moms. no.

881
00:43:28.172 --> 00:43:30.680
Okay. so I have this jacket.

882
00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:31.832
It can go.

883
00:43:31.832 --> 00:43:33.999
- Autumn. is that leather?

884
00:43:35.789 --> 00:43:36.747
- Yes.

885
00:43:36.747 --> 00:43:37.580
- Real?

886
00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:42.309
No. we are not doing a highest
in another being's skin.

887
00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:43.664
It's disgusting. no.

888
00:43:43.664 --> 00:43:45.011
Next?

889
00:43:45.011 --> 00:43:46.178
- I'm all out.

890
00:43:48.254 --> 00:43:49.427
- That was all you had?

891
00:43:49.427 --> 00:43:51.497
Yeah.

892
00:43:51.497 --> 00:43:53.520
- Okay. don't worry.

893
00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:55.221
I'll worry about the outfits. okay?

894
00:43:55.221 --> 00:43:56.569
Okay. it's probably best.

895
00:43:56.569 --> 00:43:58.722
- I'll have us lookin' great.

896
00:43:58.722 --> 00:44:00.838
- But I have something that I can bring

897
00:44:00.838 --> 00:44:04.426
to the table I think
you will really enjoy.

898
00:44:04.426 --> 00:44:05.759
Close your eyes.

899
00:44:07.035 --> 00:44:08.555
'Kay. close your eyes.
- Okay.

900
00:44:08.555 --> 00:44:10.211
- You have to close your eyes for this.

901
00:44:10.211 --> 00:44:11.913
Close your eyes. all the way.

902
00:44:11.913 --> 00:44:14.189
- No. I know how closing
your eyes works. okay?

903
00:44:14.189 --> 00:44:15.099
- Good.

904
00:44:15.099 --> 00:44:17.559
Okay. now wait just a second.

905
00:44:17.559 --> 00:44:19.392
Okay. three. two. one.

906
00:44:27.298 --> 00:44:30.483
- Are you trying to be Pat Benatar?

907
00:44:30.483 --> 00:44:33.576
- As long as I don't look like Autumn

908
00:44:33.576 --> 00:44:34.440
- Well no. that's the problem.

909
00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:38.682
You look like Autumn
trying to be Pat Benatar.

910
00:44:38.682 --> 00:44:40.292
Like if somebody sees
you outside of the party.

911
00:44:40.292 --> 00:44:42.663
just being normal. Autumn. cool.

912
00:44:42.663 --> 00:44:44.825
no big deal they'll
probably forget about it.

913
00:44:44.825 --> 00:44:46.343
But if somebody sees
you outside of the party

914
00:44:46.343 --> 00:44:50.182
wearing a bright red. conspicuous-ass wig?

915
00:44:50.182 --> 00:44:51.829
They'll remember that.
even if they're drunk.

916
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:53.507
They'll be like. oh yeah. fuckin' Autumn

917
00:44:53.507 --> 00:44:55.884
was wearing that fuckin' ridiculous wig.

918
00:44:55.884 --> 00:44:58.475
and that heist happened the same night.

919
00:44:58.475 --> 00:44:59.717
How weird is that?

920
00:44:59.717 --> 00:45:01.753
What a coincidence.

921
00:45:01.753 --> 00:45:03.338
- Okay. but those are a
bunch of drunk people.

922
00:45:03.338 --> 00:45:04.671
What about cops?

923
00:45:06.156 --> 00:45:08.156
If a cop were to see me.

924
00:45:09.171 --> 00:45:12.572
- If a cop were to see you
wearing a ridiculous wig

925
00:45:12.572 --> 00:45:16.405
on the same night that
a heist was pulled off?

926
00:45:19.337 --> 00:45:20.170
No.

927
00:45:21.363 --> 00:45:23.946
- You know. I'm not good at this.

928
00:45:23.946 --> 00:45:27.779
- Didn't you get the
Pinboard that I sent you?

929
00:45:29.512 --> 00:45:33.677
The Pinboard called Not
A Heist about the heist?

930
00:45:33.677 --> 00:45:36.760
- I have my notifications turned off.

931
00:45:37.691 --> 00:45:40.045
- You can't be a productive
member of society

932
00:45:40.045 --> 00:45:44.383
in this day and age with your
notifications turned off.

933
00:45:44.383 --> 00:45:47.590
One thing that I do have for
outfits are these bandanas.

934
00:45:48.423 --> 00:45:49.777
- Perfect.
- These will disguise us.

935
00:45:49.777 --> 00:45:51.387
but we can pull them
down right afterwards.

936
00:45:51.387 --> 00:45:53.595
and it just looks like a cute scarf.

937
00:45:53.595 --> 00:45:56.235
- So. I was right on the disguise part.

938
00:45:57.333 --> 00:45:58.352
And I was right about the fact

939
00:45:58.352 --> 00:46:00.138
that orange does not go with your skin.

940
00:46:00.138 --> 00:46:01.185
You can't pull that off.

941
00:46:01.185 --> 00:46:03.828
You wear the white one.

942
00:46:03.828 --> 00:46:05.797
I like white.

943
00:46:05.797 --> 00:46:06.797
- You would.

944
00:46:10.603 --> 00:46:11.765
What are you doing?

945
00:46:11.765 --> 00:46:13.329
- For the disguise.

946
00:46:13.329 --> 00:46:16.328
- We're not joining a biker gang.

947
00:46:16.328 --> 00:46:18.975
This is to cover the
bottom half of your face.

948
00:46:18.975 --> 00:46:20.094
- Doesn't that make it hard to breathe?

949
00:46:20.094 --> 00:46:20.927
- Yeah.

950
00:46:24.334 --> 00:46:27.198
But it also disguises you.
and then you can pull it down.

951
00:46:27.198 --> 00:46:30.357
and cute. it looks like you're
just wearing a little scarf.

952
00:46:30.357 --> 00:46:34.107
Anyways. that is what
we will be wearing. so.

953
00:46:34.945 --> 00:46:35.778
thank you.

954
00:46:37.469 --> 00:46:38.302
All right.

955
00:46:39.168 --> 00:46:40.216
- For the heist?

956
00:46:40.216 --> 00:46:41.320
You have stuff for the heist.

957
00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:43.969
because we're going to
make pickle sandwiches?

958
00:46:43.969 --> 00:46:46.678
- What?
- Cucumber sandwiches. melons?

959
00:46:46.678 --> 00:46:47.806
- If a melon gets in my way

960
00:46:47.806 --> 00:46:50.993
on the heist. yeah. I'll cut a melon.

961
00:46:50.993 --> 00:46:52.636
- Those are heist knives. then.

962
00:46:52.636 --> 00:46:55.219
- Yeah. they're to cut anything

963
00:46:56.074 --> 00:46:58.657
or anyone that gets in our way.

964
00:47:00.732 --> 00:47:02.870
- Why are they colored?

965
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:06.173
- Because heist knives can be cute.

966
00:47:06.173 --> 00:47:08.923
You were raised in such a bubble.

967
00:47:10.966 --> 00:47:12.810
I got fireworks.

968
00:47:12.810 --> 00:47:13.643
- What?

969
00:47:15.152 --> 00:47:15.985
What?

970
00:47:15.985 --> 00:47:16.985
- Fireworks?

971
00:47:18.041 --> 00:47:19.283
- Yeah. they weren't like expensive

972
00:47:19.283 --> 00:47:21.452
or anything. it's no big deal.

973
00:47:21.452 --> 00:47:24.312
- Okay. you know what. I
was okay with the knives.

974
00:47:24.312 --> 00:47:26.643
I was okay with the knives
after you explained the knives.

975
00:47:26.643 --> 00:47:29.143
but this. you need to explain.

976
00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:32.000
- We're doing something secretive

977
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.966
that we don't want anybody to notice.

978
00:47:33.966 --> 00:47:38.854
These. when you light them and
they go bang. make a really

979
00:47:38.854 --> 00:47:43.269
loud noise. and they're
really bright and distracting.

980
00:47:43.269 --> 00:47:45.871
So. we can set these
off in case we need to.

981
00:47:45.871 --> 00:47:48.334
It's only if we need to.

982
00:47:48.334 --> 00:47:51.251
Don't get your panties in your ass.

983
00:47:52.563 --> 00:47:55.209
- You need to promise me something.

984
00:47:55.209 --> 00:47:58.947
That these will not end
up under someone's car.

985
00:47:58.947 --> 00:48:01.925
in someone's car. right
outside their window.

986
00:48:01.925 --> 00:48:06.045
in their house. in a bag
with dog poop on fire.

987
00:48:06.045 --> 00:48:08.641
like you probably would think of.

988
00:48:08.641 --> 00:48:09.902
- Okay. well. that's a lot of restrictions

989
00:48:09.902 --> 00:48:12.998
that you're giving me.
but calm down. okay?

990
00:48:12.998 --> 00:48:16.380
I've been lighting off fireworks
since I was fuckin' three.

991
00:48:17.896 --> 00:48:18.729
All right.

992
00:48:18.729 --> 00:48:21.027
We are good to go.

993
00:48:21.027 --> 00:48:24.256
Now. we just got to stop by the office.

994
00:48:24.256 --> 00:48:26.246
- Well. it's already after hours.

995
00:48:26.246 --> 00:48:28.385
We're not gonna be able to get in.

996
00:48:28.385 --> 00:48:29.218
- Oh.

997
00:48:30.801 --> 00:48:32.285
I always forget that other people

998
00:48:32.285 --> 00:48:34.132
don't have a manager key card.

999
00:48:34.132 --> 00:48:35.882
- They gave you that?

1000
00:48:36.975 --> 00:48:38.975
- I mean. I acquired it.

1001
00:48:40.688 --> 00:48:42.188
- You acquired it?

1002
00:48:43.093 --> 00:48:45.417
- I have Ted wrapped
around my little finger.

1003
00:48:45.417 --> 00:48:48.821
so I'm able to get
basically whatever I want.

1004
00:48:48.821 --> 00:48:49.738
- From Ted?

1005
00:48:51.477 --> 00:48:53.477
- Well. from Ted's desk.

1006
00:49:05.827 --> 00:49:06.744
Oh. no. no.

1007
00:49:09.233 --> 00:49:11.879
That looks. like. not good.

1008
00:49:11.879 --> 00:49:14.011
- Oh. my god. it doesn't.

1009
00:49:14.011 --> 00:49:17.428
- It makes you look like a clown grandma.

1010
00:49:18.924 --> 00:49:19.914
- You have it on.

1011
00:49:19.914 --> 00:49:23.122
- Yeah. but I don't look
like a clown grandma.

1012
00:49:23.122 --> 00:49:24.687
- Ew. oh. god.

1013
00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:28.630
Why won't it come off?

1014
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:29.463
- Oh.

1015
00:49:29.463 --> 00:49:31.104
- Why won't it come off?

1016
00:49:31.104 --> 00:49:31.937
Stacy-

1017
00:49:31.937 --> 00:49:33.472
- It's 45 hour lipstick.

1018
00:49:33.472 --> 00:49:34.380
- What?

1019
00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:35.349
- I paint thinner in the drawer

1020
00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:37.155
down there. if you wanted to get it.

1021
00:49:37.155 --> 00:49:39.314
That's how I take it off.

1022
00:49:39.314 --> 00:49:40.772
- With paint thinner?

1023
00:49:40.772 --> 00:49:42.480
Does it stain your lips

1024
00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:44.426
underneath?
- Mmhmm.

1025
00:49:44.426 --> 00:49:46.563
- What is in this?

1026
00:49:46.563 --> 00:49:49.842
- I mean. it's vegan and
cruelty-free. but yeah.

1027
00:49:49.842 --> 00:49:53.969
it gets down to the
fourth layer of your skin.

1028
00:49:53.969 --> 00:49:58.219
We could just put the purple
lipstick over the red.

1029
00:50:01.065 --> 00:50:03.491
- Sometimes. I wonder why my common sense

1030
00:50:03.491 --> 00:50:05.491
is not as good as yours.

1031
00:50:14.985 --> 00:50:15.985
- All right.

1032
00:50:19.223 --> 00:50:20.740
Good. it's still got some juice.

1033
00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:23.743
- That's my pepper spray from high school.

1034
00:50:23.743 --> 00:50:26.504
- Yeah. you said you
were too afraid to use it

1035
00:50:26.504 --> 00:50:28.864
and you were just going to throw it away.

1036
00:50:30.346 --> 00:50:31.873
Why would I buy a new one?

1037
00:50:31.873 --> 00:50:34.585
That's a waste of money.

1038
00:50:34.585 --> 00:50:38.335
All right. let's go get
the rest of the shit.

1039
00:50:40.604 --> 00:50:43.136
- It's off. okay. it's not hot. good.

1040
00:50:48.342 --> 00:50:49.175
- Why?

1041
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:52.043
- Why a crowbar?

1042
00:50:54.058 --> 00:50:56.383
- Why a crowbar in this room.

1043
00:50:56.383 --> 00:50:59.050
and why a crowbar for the heist?

1044
00:51:00.592 --> 00:51:03.306
- Crowbars wedge things open.

1045
00:51:03.306 --> 00:51:05.318
For instance. in this office.

1046
00:51:05.318 --> 00:51:07.756
I get packages all the time
full of massage oil. and I have

1047
00:51:07.756 --> 00:51:12.000
to crowbar 'em open because
I don't have scissors.

1048
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.194
So. boom. there's one
could use right there.

1049
00:51:14.194 --> 00:51:17.128
Also for the heist specifically.

1050
00:51:17.128 --> 00:51:19.554
I dunno. what if we can get the door open?

1051
00:51:19.554 --> 00:51:21.061
I mean. I have all the faith in the world

1052
00:51:21.061 --> 00:51:24.561
that you're going to be able to lock-pick.

1053
00:51:25.831 --> 00:51:28.020
And also you don't even
know. what if Ethan

1054
00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:32.021
has a safe you have no
idea about. and we find it?

1055
00:51:32.021 --> 00:51:34.801
Then I can crowbar that
shit open. steal that

1056
00:51:34.801 --> 00:51:37.553
good shit and make some real money.

1057
00:51:37.553 --> 00:51:41.095
It's better to be over-prepared
than under-prepared.

1058
00:51:41.095 --> 00:51:42.746
- That. I agree with you on.

1059
00:51:42.746 --> 00:51:45.930
- When I'm not prepared. I get anxious.

1060
00:51:45.930 --> 00:51:46.843
- Me. too.

1061
00:51:46.843 --> 00:51:47.676
- See?

1062
00:51:47.676 --> 00:51:48.509
- Yeah.

1063
00:51:48.509 --> 00:51:49.342
- That's why you're always anxious.

1064
00:51:49.342 --> 00:51:50.924
because you're never prepared.

1065
00:51:50.924 --> 00:51:52.065
Next room.

1066
00:51:52.065 --> 00:51:53.226
- I just got to pee first.

1067
00:51:54.412 --> 00:51:55.745
- Always peeing.

1068
00:51:59.083 --> 00:51:59.916
- Stacy.

1069
00:52:01.126 --> 00:52:02.311
I'm trying to pee.

1070
00:52:02.311 --> 00:52:04.784
What the heck are you
doing to the flowers?

1071
00:52:05.617 --> 00:52:06.450
- All right.

1072
00:52:06.450 --> 00:52:07.283
- What is that?

1073
00:52:07.283 --> 00:52:08.116
- This?

1074
00:52:09.119 --> 00:52:10.614
It's a dagger.

1075
00:52:10.614 --> 00:52:13.947
- Why is there a dagger in the bathroom?

1076
00:52:14.959 --> 00:52:16.870
- Why is there a dagger in the bathroom?

1077
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:19.814
You mean. why is there a
easily accessible weapon

1078
00:52:19.814 --> 00:52:22.252
for when I'm at my most vulnerable?

1079
00:52:22.252 --> 00:52:24.978
I think even you could
answer that. Autumn.

1080
00:52:24.978 --> 00:52:26.876
I just busted in here.

1081
00:52:26.876 --> 00:52:28.578
I could've killed you.

1082
00:52:28.578 --> 00:52:32.304
Heck. I've killed you five
times in my imagination.

1083
00:52:32.304 --> 00:52:33.810
You're not helping.

1084
00:52:33.810 --> 00:52:36.098
- Okay. well. can you just hurry up. then?

1085
00:52:36.098 --> 00:52:37.330
Because I want to get to the party

1086
00:52:37.330 --> 00:52:40.603
to take some shots before the heist.

1087
00:52:40.603 --> 00:52:43.194
- You know I'm a shy pee-er.

1088
00:52:43.194 --> 00:52:47.794
Now it's going to take me
five minutes to get started.

1089
00:52:47.794 --> 00:52:49.055
You're okay.

1090
00:52:50.925 --> 00:52:53.508
Everything's okay. you're fine.

1091
00:52:54.361 --> 00:52:55.611
Dammit. Stacy.

1092
00:52:59.569 --> 00:53:00.736
Shut the door.

1093
00:53:06.828 --> 00:53:07.661
Okay.

1094
00:53:16.638 --> 00:53:18.742
- That's Tommy Schumacher's old bat.

1095
00:53:18.742 --> 00:53:20.364
- Sure is. mother fucker.

1096
00:53:20.364 --> 00:53:23.114
Messed with the wrong 4th grader.

1097
00:53:26.387 --> 00:53:29.470
- Anger management. anger management.

1098
00:53:31.447 --> 00:53:32.280
- Okay.

1099
00:53:37.737 --> 00:53:38.570
Ah.

1100
00:53:41.278 --> 00:53:42.356
Some rope.

1101
00:53:42.356 --> 00:53:43.298
- Why?

1102
00:53:43.298 --> 00:53:44.357
- Seriously?

1103
00:53:44.357 --> 00:53:47.276
You don't understand why
we need rope for the heist?

1104
00:53:47.276 --> 00:53:50.535
Okay. well. if we need
to hog tie somebody.

1105
00:53:50.535 --> 00:53:53.387
If we get stuck on the roof and
we have to repel down. okay?

1106
00:53:53.387 --> 00:53:54.220
I don't want to get stuck on the roof.

1107
00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:55.260
Do you want want to get stuck on the roof?

1108
00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:56.093
- No.

1109
00:53:56.093 --> 00:53:59.272
- I hate getting stuck on roofs. okay?

1110
00:53:59.272 --> 00:54:00.952
I thought that was obvious.

1111
00:54:00.952 --> 00:54:03.599
- No. Stacy. this time. I want to know

1112
00:54:03.599 --> 00:54:05.898
why the rope is in the room.

1113
00:54:05.898 --> 00:54:06.856
- Oh.

1114
00:54:06.856 --> 00:54:08.312
Duh.

1115
00:54:08.312 --> 00:54:12.062
Some guys can't relax
unless they're tied up.

1116
00:54:14.765 --> 00:54:17.341
- That's how she keeps getting promoted.

1117
00:54:17.341 --> 00:54:19.607
- Oh. by the way. Autumn. I
noticed that you were sleeping

1118
00:54:19.607 --> 00:54:23.156
on your back last night. and
that's really bad for the baby.

1119
00:54:23.156 --> 00:54:25.127
- Oh. this early?

1120
00:54:25.127 --> 00:54:28.448
- I'm going to be this baby's daddy. 'kay?

1121
00:54:28.448 --> 00:54:31.131
And I've done my research
made sure that I know

1122
00:54:31.131 --> 00:54:34.741
everything there is to
know about having a baby.

1123
00:54:34.741 --> 00:54:37.029
- I know you have. thank you.

1124
00:54:37.029 --> 00:54:39.031
- All right. well. we
should leave our phones

1125
00:54:39.031 --> 00:54:41.537
in here so that we they can't track us.

1126
00:54:41.537 --> 00:54:42.370
- They?

1127
00:54:44.413 --> 00:54:49.413
- The government. FBI. CIA.
people that might want bad guys.

1128
00:54:49.795 --> 00:54:54.007
which is what we're going to
be after we go and do this?

1129
00:54:55.427 --> 00:54:56.315
Can you reach into the glove box

1130
00:54:56.315 --> 00:54:59.065
and grab my burner phone. please?

1131
00:55:00.387 --> 00:55:01.339
- Your burner phone?

1132
00:55:01.339 --> 00:55:03.549
- Yeah. it's not a gun.
it's just a burner phone.

1133
00:55:03.549 --> 00:55:04.527
Why are you acting like-

1134
00:55:04.527 --> 00:55:07.010
- Why do we need a burner phone?

1135
00:55:07.010 --> 00:55:09.633
- Well. in case of emergencies?

1136
00:55:09.633 --> 00:55:12.909
Tons of things can go wrong in a heist.

1137
00:55:12.909 --> 00:55:17.187
I've got a burner phone in
case we need to call someone.

1138
00:55:17.187 --> 00:55:20.174
That's what phones are for.

1139
00:55:20.174 --> 00:55:21.063
- I don't want to do this.

1140
00:55:21.063 --> 00:55:22.271
- I don't want to fight. either.

1141
00:55:49.524 --> 00:55:51.190
- It's the cops. oh shit. clean up.

1142
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:52.690
- What's going on?

1143
00:55:53.890 --> 00:55:55.437
We're got a report of a loud party.

1144
00:55:55.437 --> 00:55:57.639
Take your IDs out.

1145
00:55:57.639 --> 00:55:58.514
How long you been using?

1146
00:55:58.514 --> 00:55:59.350
- That's my EpiPen.

1147
00:55:59.350 --> 00:56:01.699
- Yeah. well. looks like drugs to me.

1148
00:56:01.699 --> 00:56:02.814
- Yo. let's go.

1149
00:56:02.814 --> 00:56:04.250
I ain't goin' back. man.

1150
00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:05.790
- I want you to touch
the tip of your finger

1151
00:56:05.790 --> 00:56:07.369
to the tip of your
nose. do you understand?

1152
00:56:07.369 --> 00:56:08.202
- Yeah.

1153
00:56:08.202 --> 00:56:09.517
- All right. left.

1154
00:56:11.098 --> 00:56:12.922
I said left.

1155
00:56:12.922 --> 00:56:14.363
How old are you?

1156
00:56:14.363 --> 00:56:15.598
- 21.

1157
00:56:15.598 --> 00:56:16.539
- Yeah. right.

1158
00:56:16.539 --> 00:56:17.861
- They're gonna shut down this
party. 'cause it's getting

1159
00:56:17.861 --> 00:56:21.116
way too crazy in here. and
then. we're out of an alibi.

1160
00:56:21.116 --> 00:56:22.351
- Calm down.

1161
00:56:22.351 --> 00:56:25.456
You're about to do that
squeaky voice that I hate.

1162
00:56:25.456 --> 00:56:28.493
I have like a hundred dollars
worth of fireworks in my bag.

1163
00:56:28.493 --> 00:56:31.395
You and I are going to go set these off.

1164
00:56:31.395 --> 00:56:36.063
and the cops will go down
the street to investigate

1165
00:56:36.063 --> 00:56:37.564
- I could call a paddy wagon right now.

1166
00:56:37.564 --> 00:56:39.999
and have you all taken to jail.

1167
00:56:39.999 --> 00:56:43.817
But lucky for you. it's
the end of my shift.

1168
00:56:47.762 --> 00:56:48.595
Ah.

1169
00:56:52.394 --> 00:56:53.504
- Oh. I love selfies.

1170
00:56:53.504 --> 00:56:56.921
- You're so hot. get in here.

1171
00:57:04.985 --> 00:57:07.013
- Oh. my gosh. Allison.
you look so cute tonight.

1172
00:57:07.013 --> 00:57:08.571
We should totally do a selfie together.

1173
00:57:08.571 --> 00:57:09.404
- You do. too.

1174
00:57:09.404 --> 00:57:11.537
Yeah. let's put ourselves on Instagram.

1175
00:57:11.537 --> 00:57:12.370
Ooop.

1176
00:57:13.685 --> 00:57:14.518
Aaah!

1177
00:57:19.796 --> 00:57:22.497
- Do you see those two girls over there?

1178
00:57:22.497 --> 00:57:25.288
They're totally staring at us.

1179
00:57:25.288 --> 00:57:26.688
- Oh. you're right.

1180
00:57:26.688 --> 00:57:29.317
They are totally staring at us so hard.

1181
00:57:29.317 --> 00:57:30.176
- What is their problem?

1182
00:57:30.176 --> 00:57:32.685
They totally need to
mind their own business.

1183
00:57:32.685 --> 00:57:34.164
- I don't know.

1184
00:57:34.164 --> 00:57:35.582
But you know what. Kristy?

1185
00:57:35.582 --> 00:57:37.201
I'm going to go find out.

1186
00:57:37.201 --> 00:57:39.618
What is your fucking problem?

1187
00:57:41.229 --> 00:57:46.116
Your eyes are like daggers.
and they're just stabbing me

1188
00:57:46.116 --> 00:57:48.533
over and over and over again.

1189
00:57:49.678 --> 00:57:51.886
- You lookin' at her?

1190
00:57:51.886 --> 00:57:53.323
I haven't been looking at you.

1191
00:57:53.323 --> 00:57:55.823
- Can we just like be friends?

1192
00:57:57.842 --> 00:58:00.553
- I could see tequila shots in our future.

1193
00:58:00.553 --> 00:58:04.590
- Tequila. that's always a
really good way to make friends.

1194
00:58:04.590 --> 00:58:05.423
- Mmhmm.

1195
00:58:05.423 --> 00:58:07.500
- You know what else.
though. is really fun?

1196
00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:08.333
What?

1197
00:58:08.333 --> 00:58:09.333
- Strippers.

1198
00:58:10.982 --> 00:58:14.149
You should dare me to hire a stripper.

1199
00:58:15.817 --> 00:58:17.497
- I think that's a great idea.

1200
00:58:17.497 --> 00:58:19.884
Matter of fact. you can
use my phone to call one.

1201
00:58:19.884 --> 00:58:20.973
- Thank you.

1202
00:58:20.973 --> 00:58:21.806
- No. no. no. Allison.

1203
00:58:21.806 --> 00:58:23.833
- We're getting a stripper.

1204
00:58:23.833 --> 00:58:24.697
- 84 episodes.

1205
00:58:24.697 --> 00:58:27.721
You're not going to prove me wrong.

1206
00:58:27.721 --> 00:58:30.313
- Richard. I'm sorry
I have to do this to you.

1207
00:58:30.313 --> 00:58:31.751
but I'm gonna look it up.

1208
00:58:31.751 --> 00:58:33.396
- Yeah. ask your best friend. Google.

1209
00:58:33.396 --> 00:58:34.584
- Is that a camera phone?

1210
00:58:34.584 --> 00:58:36.012
Let's take a selfie.

1211
00:58:36.012 --> 00:58:37.595
Come on. get close.

1212
00:58:40.310 --> 00:58:42.560
Perfect. thank you so much.

1213
00:58:44.809 --> 00:58:48.291
- He was short. just like a
bean pole. you know what I mean?

1214
00:58:48.291 --> 00:58:50.543
'Cause it just feels weird.

1215
00:58:50.543 --> 00:58:51.376
- Hey. ladies.

1216
00:58:51.376 --> 00:58:52.209
- Oh. no.

1217
00:58:52.209 --> 00:58:54.006
- Are those space pants?

1218
00:58:54.006 --> 00:58:56.536
'Cause your ass is out of this world.

1219
00:58:56.536 --> 00:58:57.536
- Wow. okay.

1220
00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:00.918
That's cute.

1221
00:59:00.918 --> 00:59:04.011
Just take all this cuteness.

1222
00:59:04.011 --> 00:59:07.144
and just take it right over there.

1223
00:59:07.144 --> 00:59:11.081
- I'll take it anywhere you want to. baby.

1224
00:59:11.081 --> 00:59:12.652
Ooo. short hair.

1225
00:59:12.652 --> 00:59:16.348
I haven't been with a short
haired-chick in five chicks.

1226
00:59:16.348 --> 00:59:19.168
- That is totally the
pickup line I wanted.

1227
00:59:19.168 --> 00:59:20.262
- Well then. why don't we take this

1228
00:59:20.262 --> 00:59:23.429
right up to the bedroom and finish it?

1229
00:59:24.725 --> 00:59:27.292
- You'll do anything to
get in our pants. will you?

1230
00:59:27.292 --> 00:59:31.385
- I would do literally anything
to get with you two chicks.

1231
00:59:31.385 --> 00:59:34.593
- Maybe try putting a keg on the roof?

1232
00:59:34.593 --> 00:59:37.686
- I will do a keg stand on the roof.

1233
00:59:37.686 --> 00:59:38.769
I'm a genius.

1234
00:59:41.129 --> 00:59:42.143
- Stacy.

1235
00:59:42.143 --> 00:59:42.976
- Oh. hey.

1236
00:59:42.976 --> 00:59:43.888
- How are you?

1237
00:59:43.888 --> 00:59:45.510
- What are you doing here?

1238
00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:47.629
- You're so funny.

1239
00:59:47.629 --> 00:59:49.974
I invited you. remember?

1240
00:59:49.974 --> 00:59:50.807
Oh.

1241
00:59:52.015 --> 00:59:53.668
You did. of course you'd be here. because.

1242
00:59:54.501 --> 00:59:58.460
Stacy. you are just so
beautiful. you look immaculate.

1243
00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:02.924
You didn't have the braid in
the other night. and just.

1244
01:00:03.757 --> 01:00:04.772
- What are you doing?

1245
01:00:04.772 --> 01:00:05.605
No.

1246
01:00:06.752 --> 01:00:08.278
- Am I not allowed to do that?

1247
01:00:08.278 --> 01:00:10.428
- I'm shy. I don't like PDA.

1248
01:00:10.428 --> 01:00:12.252
and there's tons of people here.

1249
01:00:12.252 --> 01:00:14.652
- I just thought we
were kind of. you know.

1250
01:00:14.652 --> 01:00:15.485
- Oh no.

1251
01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:20.063
Is that dark beer you're drinking?

1252
01:00:20.063 --> 01:00:22.009
- I know. yeah. unfortunately.

1253
01:00:22.009 --> 01:00:25.104
- Cameron. you're not gonna
get to those big muscles.

1254
01:00:25.104 --> 01:00:27.493
- It's the only thing
they had in the fridge.

1255
01:00:27.493 --> 01:00:29.318
I can't drive. I'm not
gonna go out right now.

1256
01:00:29.318 --> 01:00:32.305
- What if I told you.
you can get six times

1257
01:00:32.305 --> 01:00:34.412
the drunkness with none of the calories?

1258
01:00:34.412 --> 01:00:35.269
- You're a liar.

1259
01:00:35.269 --> 01:00:36.460
- I'm not a liar.

1260
01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:38.992
It's called a beer enema.

1261
01:00:38.992 --> 01:00:41.872
You might feel a little pop.

1262
01:00:43.418 --> 01:00:45.085
Perfect. just relax.

1263
01:00:50.561 --> 01:00:52.937
You've had the equivalent of a six pack.

1264
01:00:55.891 --> 01:00:57.308
- Steady. steady.

1265
01:00:59.059 --> 01:01:00.124
- I can't really hear you.

1266
01:01:00.124 --> 01:01:03.689
you're kind of slurring your words.

1267
01:01:15.401 --> 01:01:16.491
What?

1268
01:01:16.491 --> 01:01:18.795
- What are you doing?

1269
01:01:18.795 --> 01:01:21.208
- Getting in the heist car.

1270
01:01:21.208 --> 01:01:23.366
- This is not your car.

1271
01:01:23.366 --> 01:01:25.182
- Yeah. I know. I wouldn't use

1272
01:01:25.182 --> 01:01:27.838
my own car for the heist car.

1273
01:01:28.947 --> 01:01:29.780
- What?

1274
01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:31.539
Like. you want me to get
captured by all the cameras

1275
01:01:31.539 --> 01:01:33.964
at the grocery stores
and the gas stations?

1276
01:01:33.964 --> 01:01:37.850
'Cause that would be really
smart. Autumn. wouldn't it?

1277
01:01:37.850 --> 01:01:39.674
- What if someone reports a car stolen?

1278
01:01:39.674 --> 01:01:40.540
- What?

1279
01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:44.044
No. it's taken care of.
you don't need to worry.

1280
01:01:44.044 --> 01:01:45.044
Pinky swear.

1281
01:01:46.323 --> 01:01:48.819
The party just started.
nobody's even drunk yet.

1282
01:01:48.819 --> 01:01:50.799
which means nobody's
going to come out here

1283
01:01:50.799 --> 01:01:54.089
and notice that this pile of shit's gone.

1284
01:01:54.089 --> 01:01:56.163
- It is a pretty shitty car.

1285
01:01:56.163 --> 01:02:00.302
- It's really shitty.
it even smells shitty.

1286
01:02:00.302 --> 01:02:03.090
- We could be doing him
a favor by taking it.

1287
01:02:03.090 --> 01:02:05.081
- Yeah. that's the spirit.

1288
01:02:05.081 --> 01:02:07.414
Let's get in this shit wagon.

1289
01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:32.390
All right. let's grab the
loot bags. the heist bag.

1290
01:02:34.358 --> 01:02:35.724
All right. got everything?

1291
01:02:35.724 --> 01:02:37.491
Yeah.

1292
01:02:37.491 --> 01:02:38.713
- Ready?

1293
01:02:38.713 --> 01:02:39.660
- Yeah.

1294
01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:43.327
- Okay. we're going to
go sneak around back.

1295
01:02:44.881 --> 01:02:46.609
What are the odds it's just unlocked?

1296
01:02:46.609 --> 01:02:48.664
- Oh no. he never leaves it unlocked.

1297
01:02:48.664 --> 01:02:49.497
Okay.

1298
01:02:49.497 --> 01:02:51.032
- Hurry up.

1299
01:02:51.032 --> 01:02:52.424
Somebody's going to see us.

1300
01:02:52.424 --> 01:02:55.169
- This is from the Pinboard post. okay?

1301
01:02:55.169 --> 01:02:56.766
I actually read it.

1302
01:02:56.766 --> 01:02:58.760
- Okay. well. did you watch
any of the videos I sent?

1303
01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:00.200
- There were videos?

1304
01:03:01.051 --> 01:03:02.648
- Autumn. unlock the fucking door.

1305
01:03:02.648 --> 01:03:04.856
- It's not me. it's the stupid bobby pin.

1306
01:03:04.856 --> 01:03:06.314
- Autumn. this was literally your one

1307
01:03:06.314 --> 01:03:08.168
fucking job. and you're failing at it.

1308
01:03:08.168 --> 01:03:09.281
- I read every step.

1309
01:03:09.281 --> 01:03:11.118
It's supposed to take
a little bit of time.

1310
01:03:11.118 --> 01:03:13.976
- Well. it's not working.
and it's taking forever.

1311
01:03:18.152 --> 01:03:19.169
- Stacy.

1312
01:03:19.169 --> 01:03:20.836
- Well. that worked.

1313
01:03:27.245 --> 01:03:29.574
- Let's start with the games.

1314
01:03:29.574 --> 01:03:31.051
- All of them?

1315
01:03:31.051 --> 01:03:33.857
- Yeah. I mean. they
gotta be worth something.

1316
01:03:33.857 --> 01:03:36.584
And besides. you said it was
Ethan's favorite thing. right?

1317
01:03:36.584 --> 01:03:37.417
- Mmhmm.

1318
01:03:37.417 --> 01:03:38.670
- So. let's make him cry.

1319
01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:40.241
- Hell yes.

1320
01:03:40.241 --> 01:03:41.836
- I mean. that's what he was always

1321
01:03:41.836 --> 01:03:44.933
spending all of your rent money on. so.

1322
01:03:44.933 --> 01:03:47.100
I think I broke something.

1323
01:03:48.487 --> 01:03:49.904
- Oh. and the TV?

1324
01:03:51.918 --> 01:03:53.584
- This?
- Yeah.

1325
01:03:53.584 --> 01:03:56.465
- We can only take what
will fit in our duffel bags.

1326
01:03:56.465 --> 01:03:57.605
- It's gotta be worth something.

1327
01:03:57.605 --> 01:03:59.873
- Well. yeah. but I
don't want to be caught

1328
01:03:59.873 --> 01:04:01.070
if shit hits the fan carrying

1329
01:04:01.070 --> 01:04:04.059
this big TV. and neither do you.

1330
01:04:04.059 --> 01:04:05.142
- Fair point.

1331
01:04:05.979 --> 01:04:08.513
- Comic books. where does he keep 'em?

1332
01:04:08.513 --> 01:04:09.771
- Over there.

1333
01:04:09.771 --> 01:04:10.812
Okay. cool.

1334
01:04:10.812 --> 01:04:12.001
- Okay.

1335
01:04:12.001 --> 01:04:14.113
So. here are these stupid things.

1336
01:04:14.113 --> 01:04:15.361
- Wow.

1337
01:04:15.361 --> 01:04:18.350
- He said he didn't want
to have children with me.

1338
01:04:18.350 --> 01:04:21.049
because these were his babies.

1339
01:04:21.049 --> 01:04:25.537
- Yeah. well. I told him you
to ditch him a bunch of times.

1340
01:04:25.537 --> 01:04:28.069
- First edition. mint copies hand-wrapped.

1341
01:04:30.344 --> 01:04:33.677
Every single one of these. a month's rent.

1342
01:04:34.923 --> 01:04:35.756
- What?

1343
01:04:35.756 --> 01:04:37.694
- Yep. he would not pay the rent

1344
01:04:37.694 --> 01:04:41.163
because he had to invest in himself.

1345
01:04:41.163 --> 01:04:43.621
So. these are worth a
month's rent. each of these?

1346
01:04:43.621 --> 01:04:44.667
- Uh-huh.

1347
01:04:44.667 --> 01:04:46.574
Screw the money. let's burn these.

1348
01:04:46.574 --> 01:04:47.407
- What?

1349
01:04:47.407 --> 01:04:48.240
No.

1350
01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:50.030
- Please. you love burning shit.

1351
01:04:50.030 --> 01:04:51.601
- They probably have only gone up

1352
01:04:51.601 --> 01:04:54.120
in value since he purchased them.

1353
01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:57.227
These are now our babies. okay?

1354
01:04:57.227 --> 01:04:59.676
So. as much as we would like to burn them

1355
01:04:59.676 --> 01:05:02.702
and film it and send it to
him anonymously. we can't.

1356
01:05:02.702 --> 01:05:05.329
Because you have a thing
growing inside of you

1357
01:05:05.329 --> 01:05:08.123
that is going to be coming
in about eight months.

1358
01:05:08.123 --> 01:05:09.109
Remember. you don't have a place

1359
01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:11.445
to live. you don't have a car.

1360
01:05:11.445 --> 01:05:12.278
- Fine.

1361
01:05:13.141 --> 01:05:16.267
But those aren't even his pride and joy.

1362
01:05:16.267 --> 01:05:17.225
- There's more?

1363
01:05:17.225 --> 01:05:18.058
- Oh. yes.

1364
01:05:18.058 --> 01:05:20.062
In the glass case you will see the ones

1365
01:05:20.062 --> 01:05:23.312
that are protected from. well. us.

1366
01:05:24.286 --> 01:05:25.386
- I thought I would start to feel bad

1367
01:05:25.386 --> 01:05:27.537
about taking all of Ethan's shit.

1368
01:05:27.537 --> 01:05:28.370
- You?

1369
01:05:28.370 --> 01:05:31.054
- But the more and more of
his stuff that we take.

1370
01:05:31.054 --> 01:05:33.707
the more I just feel like he deserves it.

1371
01:05:33.707 --> 01:05:36.165
We'll be able to buy a ton of stuff.

1372
01:05:36.165 --> 01:05:39.333
I can get a boob job. or a new car.

1373
01:05:39.333 --> 01:05:41.195
- Why not both?

1374
01:05:41.195 --> 01:05:44.205
- Whoa. I like the new Autumn.

1375
01:05:44.205 --> 01:05:46.040
You're a little badass.

1376
01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:48.239
- Hey. maybe I'll get a boob job.

1377
01:05:48.239 --> 01:05:50.341
- You can't get a boob job.

1378
01:05:50.341 --> 01:05:51.390
- Aw. come on.

1379
01:05:51.390 --> 01:05:53.498
- It makes it harder
to breastfeed the baby.

1380
01:05:53.498 --> 01:05:55.612
No. you need to stop being so selfish.

1381
01:05:55.612 --> 01:05:57.858
All right. now let's go
steal some more shit.

1382
01:05:57.858 --> 01:05:58.691
- Okay.

1383
01:06:22.496 --> 01:06:24.063
Okay. I really want to get all my clothes

1384
01:06:24.063 --> 01:06:27.061
out of the closet. then we
never have to come back.

1385
01:06:27.061 --> 01:06:27.894
- What?

1386
01:06:27.894 --> 01:06:28.911
No.

1387
01:06:28.911 --> 01:06:31.621
We can't steal any of your fugly-ass shit.

1388
01:06:31.621 --> 01:06:32.965
- Why not?

1389
01:06:32.965 --> 01:06:35.977
- Well. for one. no burglar is going

1390
01:06:35.977 --> 01:06:38.860
to come in here and steal
your fucking clothes.

1391
01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:41.007
So. he'll know it was you.

1392
01:06:41.007 --> 01:06:41.840
- Dammit.

1393
01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:42.673
- I know.

1394
01:06:43.717 --> 01:06:47.005
'Cause I would love to get my jacket back

1395
01:06:47.005 --> 01:06:52.005
that you borrowed and never
gave back to me. but I can't.

1396
01:06:52.191 --> 01:06:54.039
- What did you just do?

1397
01:06:54.039 --> 01:06:55.956
- Oh. I'm redecorating.

1398
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:58.432
Redecorating.

1399
01:06:59.391 --> 01:07:01.551
- I want to fuck with him a little bit.

1400
01:07:01.551 --> 01:07:03.052
Pull some pranks on him.

1401
01:07:03.052 --> 01:07:04.264
- I've got one.

1402
01:07:04.264 --> 01:07:07.996
- I would say I'm excited.
but your ideas usually stink.

1403
01:07:07.996 --> 01:07:12.937
- Oh. it'll stink. but not
the way you're thinking.

1404
01:07:12.937 --> 01:07:17.330
- Did you bring fart
bombs without telling me?

1405
01:07:17.330 --> 01:07:20.997
- This little gem I
have had for two months.

1406
01:07:22.729 --> 01:07:24.312
- Ew. is that fish?

1407
01:07:25.417 --> 01:07:28.334
- Yeah. it's pollock. and it's old.

1408
01:07:29.264 --> 01:07:31.264
And the heater's broken.

1409
01:07:32.936 --> 01:07:36.226
- Oh. you want to
put it in the vents?

1410
01:07:36.226 --> 01:07:37.726
I fucking love it.

1411
01:07:39.598 --> 01:07:42.670
- Not only that. now we have old fish

1412
01:07:42.670 --> 01:07:46.113
with heat constantly running over it.

1413
01:07:46.113 --> 01:07:47.975
- Is that why it's hot as balls in here?

1414
01:07:47.975 --> 01:07:50.712
- That is correct. and that is also why

1415
01:07:50.712 --> 01:07:54.629
it will be hot as balls
and smell like the sea.

1416
01:07:55.979 --> 01:07:59.387
- Who are you. and what
did you do with Autumn?

1417
01:07:59.387 --> 01:08:00.720
- I'm the devil.

1418
01:08:01.810 --> 01:08:04.227
- Okay. that's kind of dorky.

1419
01:08:07.593 --> 01:08:08.426
- Jackpot.

1420
01:08:17.278 --> 01:08:18.111
Stacy.

1421
01:08:19.176 --> 01:08:21.343
What are you doing?

1422
01:08:21.343 --> 01:08:23.552
- Poking holes in Ethan's condoms?

1423
01:08:23.552 --> 01:08:25.342
- So he can get more chicks pregnant?

1424
01:08:25.342 --> 01:08:26.530
- Well. I mean. so we can get the chick

1425
01:08:26.530 --> 01:08:29.645
that he left you for pregnant.

1426
01:08:29.645 --> 01:08:31.835
- We don't hate her.

1427
01:08:31.835 --> 01:08:33.418
- I kinda hate her.

1428
01:08:34.290 --> 01:08:35.886
Okay.

1429
01:08:35.886 --> 01:08:36.969
You're right.

1430
01:08:37.879 --> 01:08:39.869
You wouldn't get as much child support.

1431
01:08:39.869 --> 01:08:41.549
- Well. that's one reason. other than

1432
01:08:41.549 --> 01:08:44.168
it being completely unethical.

1433
01:08:44.168 --> 01:08:46.725
- All right. fine. let's
go throw these away.

1434
01:08:46.725 --> 01:08:50.058
We'll find something else amazing to do.

1435
01:09:00.415 --> 01:09:02.855
Hey. Ethan smokes. right?

1436
01:09:02.855 --> 01:09:07.187
Yeah. all the time. even inside.
It's absolutely disgusting.

1437
01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:08.853
- Ew.

1438
01:09:08.853 --> 01:09:09.686
Cool.

1439
01:09:15.249 --> 01:09:17.422
- So. class today was pretty boring.

1440
01:09:17.422 --> 01:09:18.356
Obviously.

1441
01:09:18.356 --> 01:09:19.803
When is it not boring?

1442
01:09:25.912 --> 01:09:26.921
- Hey guys.

1443
01:09:26.921 --> 01:09:29.072
- Just ignore him.

1444
01:09:29.072 --> 01:09:30.673
- Did you hear they tried
to fire the principal?

1445
01:09:30.673 --> 01:09:31.875
- I heard that.

1446
01:09:31.875 --> 01:09:33.081
- Whoa. that is

1447
01:09:33.081 --> 01:09:34.534
- Don't touch

1448
01:09:34.534 --> 01:09:36.087
the sweater. man.
- Whoa. okay. okay.

1449
01:09:36.087 --> 01:09:37.023
- He punched a guy. once.

1450
01:09:37.023 --> 01:09:40.266
- I apologize. I thought
it was a nice sweatshirt

1451
01:09:40.266 --> 01:09:42.266
and I'm just not having.

1452
01:09:44.909 --> 01:09:46.170
why are you guys out?

1453
01:09:46.170 --> 01:09:47.527
It's late.

1454
01:09:47.527 --> 01:09:50.152
- He smells so bad.

1455
01:09:50.152 --> 01:09:52.538
- I lost my car and I don't know.

1456
01:09:52.538 --> 01:09:54.242
- How do you lose a car?

1457
01:09:54.242 --> 01:09:57.159
- I walked outside and it was gone.

1458
01:09:58.939 --> 01:10:01.392
Now it's gone. and I
don't know what to do.

1459
01:10:01.392 --> 01:10:03.778
- Well. can you press a
little button on your keys?

1460
01:10:03.778 --> 01:10:05.990
- You know. make it beep.
- Like an alarm.

1461
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:07.510
- On my keys?

1462
01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:08.343
- Yeah.

1463
01:10:08.343 --> 01:10:10.326
- I don't have the keys
now. and my car has gone.

1464
01:10:10.326 --> 01:10:13.409
Have you guys seen it. by any chance?

1465
01:10:15.844 --> 01:10:16.979
- And he's down. okay.

1466
01:10:16.979 --> 01:10:18.519
- I don't know what to do.

1467
01:10:20.455 --> 01:10:21.842
- Buddy.

1468
01:10:21.842 --> 01:10:23.502
Sanchez.

1469
01:10:23.502 --> 01:10:24.558
My name is Greg.

1470
01:10:24.558 --> 01:10:25.682
- Greg. okay.

1471
01:10:25.682 --> 01:10:28.206
Where did you come from. Greg?

1472
01:10:28.206 --> 01:10:29.116
- Yeah?

1473
01:10:29.116 --> 01:10:30.300
- A party.

1474
01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:31.602
Of course.

1475
01:10:31.602 --> 01:10:32.435
- Okay?

1476
01:10:33.691 --> 01:10:35.671
I just need my car. that's all I need.

1477
01:10:35.671 --> 01:10:39.411
- Well. color. anything. license plate?

1478
01:10:39.411 --> 01:10:40.259
Seafoam.

1479
01:10:41.092 --> 01:10:41.986
- Seafoam?

1480
01:10:41.986 --> 01:10:45.997
- It's a green color. I
didn't choose it. okay?

1481
01:10:45.997 --> 01:10:47.266
- Got it. I see.

1482
01:10:47.266 --> 01:10:48.463
- It was my sister's.

1483
01:10:48.463 --> 01:10:50.687
You know. I think
we saw a seafoam car.

1484
01:10:50.687 --> 01:10:51.773
I think it went that way?

1485
01:10:51.773 --> 01:10:53.007
- Yeah.
- Yeah. that way.

1486
01:10:53.007 --> 01:10:54.667
- You just let it go?

1487
01:10:54.667 --> 01:10:55.999
- What are we going to do. jump on it?

1488
01:10:55.999 --> 01:10:57.846
- I thought you'd at
least try to stop it.

1489
01:10:57.846 --> 01:11:00.246
- We didn't know it was your car.

1490
01:11:00.246 --> 01:11:01.619
- I just thought-

1491
01:11:01.619 --> 01:11:02.599
- Okay. Craig. whatever.

1492
01:11:02.599 --> 01:11:04.060
- It's Greg.

1493
01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:05.075
- Greg.

1494
01:11:05.075 --> 01:11:05.922
- What are you doing out here?

1495
01:11:05.922 --> 01:11:07.383
You can't drive.

1496
01:11:07.383 --> 01:11:09.023
You're wasted.

1497
01:11:12.216 --> 01:11:14.354
- You know what?

1498
01:11:14.354 --> 01:11:16.421
You guys aren't gonna help me. obviously.

1499
01:11:16.421 --> 01:11:17.254
- No.

1500
01:11:17.254 --> 01:11:19.977
- You're not. you're not. and you're not.

1501
01:11:19.977 --> 01:11:24.057
So. I am gonna go find my seafoam car.

1502
01:11:24.937 --> 01:11:25.770
- Seafoam.

1503
01:11:25.770 --> 01:11:26.603
- Forget it. you guys.

1504
01:11:26.603 --> 01:11:27.436
- Okay. bye.

1505
01:11:27.436 --> 01:11:29.941
- I stole Ethan's divine phallic symbol.

1506
01:11:29.941 --> 01:11:30.941
His katana.

1507
01:11:32.725 --> 01:11:36.662
I think it's some replica of some anime.

1508
01:11:36.662 --> 01:11:39.828
I don't even know. but he loves it.

1509
01:11:39.828 --> 01:11:40.661
- He's such an.

1510
01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:43.597
- He's home?

1511
01:11:43.597 --> 01:11:44.514
- What. no.

1512
01:11:45.465 --> 01:11:46.695
- Go get the bat.

1513
01:11:46.695 --> 01:11:47.930
- What bat?

1514
01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:50.945
- The bat that we broke the
window to break in here. go.

1515
01:11:52.291 --> 01:11:53.291
Come on. go.

1516
01:11:56.033 --> 01:11:57.782
Behind the couch. come on.

1517
01:11:57.782 --> 01:11:58.926
Get down here. now.

1518
01:11:58.926 --> 01:11:59.843
Go. go. go.

1519
01:12:06.353 --> 01:12:08.457
- Yeah. I just got here.

1520
01:12:08.457 --> 01:12:10.074
No. just going to feed Sprinkles.

1521
01:12:10.074 --> 01:12:12.324
and then I'll be on my way.

1522
01:12:13.790 --> 01:12:14.623
All right.

1523
01:12:30.422 --> 01:12:34.005
- Okay. fine. I'll get
you some food. geez.

1524
01:12:56.568 --> 01:12:58.136
- I think he's gone.

1525
01:12:58.136 --> 01:12:59.648
- Oh. my god.

1526
01:12:59.648 --> 01:13:01.985
- I thought I was going
to have to stab him.

1527
01:13:04.109 --> 01:13:06.276
He almost lit a cigarette.

1528
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:09.259
- That's what you were worried about?

1529
01:13:09.259 --> 01:13:10.856
Not him finding us?

1530
01:13:10.856 --> 01:13:12.068
- The house would've blown up

1531
01:13:12.068 --> 01:13:13.832
if he'd lit a cigarette.

1532
01:13:13.832 --> 01:13:14.665
- What?

1533
01:13:15.654 --> 01:13:16.881
- Oh. don't play dumb.

1534
01:13:16.881 --> 01:13:21.044
What did you think I was
doing in the kitchen?

1535
01:13:21.044 --> 01:13:21.877
- Stacy.

1536
01:13:23.528 --> 01:13:24.361
- What?

1537
01:13:24.361 --> 01:13:27.493
You don't want me to put
holes in the condoms. right?

1538
01:13:29.012 --> 01:13:29.994
- Oh. my god.

1539
01:13:29.994 --> 01:13:31.161
Take your bat.

1540
01:13:32.348 --> 01:13:33.391
- Phew.

1541
01:13:33.391 --> 01:13:35.970
Okay. well let's just go.
that was way too close.

1542
01:13:35.970 --> 01:13:39.343
And apparently. he likes
to come back a lot.

1543
01:13:39.343 --> 01:13:40.829
- Where's the fourth bag?

1544
01:13:40.829 --> 01:13:42.996
- We only have three bags.

1545
01:13:44.456 --> 01:13:46.956
- What. go. let's go. come on.

1546
01:14:10.498 --> 01:14:12.620
That felt so good.

1547
01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:16.172
- Got his katana. his stupid comics.

1548
01:14:16.172 --> 01:14:17.910
Both of those are gonna be

1549
01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:21.248
cold. hard cash for me and my baby.

1550
01:14:21.248 --> 01:14:23.408
Yeah. money. money. money.

1551
01:14:24.294 --> 01:14:25.902
- Oh. my god.

1552
01:14:25.902 --> 01:14:28.689
We're gonna buy a new car for me

1553
01:14:28.689 --> 01:14:30.320
and boobs for you.
- Money. money. money.

1554
01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:31.158
- Yeah.

1555
01:14:31.158 --> 01:14:33.028
- And a new car for you. 'cause
you're going to get both.

1556
01:14:33.028 --> 01:14:34.111
- Oh yeah. yeah.

1557
01:14:34.111 --> 01:14:34.944
- Ooh.

1558
01:14:35.996 --> 01:14:36.829
Let's get a house together.

1559
01:14:36.829 --> 01:14:37.926
- Yes.

1560
01:14:37.926 --> 01:14:39.193
- Let's do it.

1561
01:14:39.193 --> 01:14:41.458
- That way. I can like really
be a father to your child.

1562
01:14:41.458 --> 01:14:43.259
- You are the father of my child.

1563
01:14:43.259 --> 01:14:45.259
Thank god Ethan is gone.

1564
01:14:46.211 --> 01:14:47.044
Yes.

1565
01:14:47.044 --> 01:14:48.012
- Oh. my god.

1566
01:14:48.012 --> 01:14:50.323
You have no idea how long I prayed.

1567
01:14:50.323 --> 01:14:51.910
- You prayed?

1568
01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:53.773
- I almost became a Christian in order

1569
01:14:53.773 --> 01:14:55.712
to make my prayers count more.

1570
01:14:55.712 --> 01:14:57.526
- Oh my god. you hate Christianity.

1571
01:14:57.526 --> 01:15:00.657
- I just hate organized religion. period.

1572
01:15:00.657 --> 01:15:03.434
- So. you hate Ethan more
than organized religion?

1573
01:15:03.434 --> 01:15:04.267
- Yeah.

1574
01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:06.742
I almost forgot.

1575
01:15:06.742 --> 01:15:07.575
- What?

1576
01:15:07.575 --> 01:15:09.347
- I still have Killian's keys.

1577
01:15:09.347 --> 01:15:10.848
- You mean Craig?

1578
01:15:10.848 --> 01:15:12.755
- Whatever his name is. I don't care.

1579
01:15:12.755 --> 01:15:14.493
Let's get back into the party.

1580
01:15:14.493 --> 01:15:15.326
- Okay.

1581
01:15:15.326 --> 01:15:16.988
- Get into as many more photos as you can.

1582
01:15:16.988 --> 01:15:19.086
We're gonna have a rock-solid alibi.

1583
01:15:20.025 --> 01:15:21.442
- I feel so free.

1584
01:15:22.507 --> 01:15:25.126
- Yeah. I feel alive right now.

1585
01:15:25.126 --> 01:15:29.165
Like that time that I did
cocaine. like. so much cocaine.

1586
01:15:30.992 --> 01:15:32.659
Oh my god. let's go.

1587
01:15:34.822 --> 01:15:38.503
- So. I'd to thank you for.
like. listening to my problems.

1588
01:15:38.503 --> 01:15:40.752
You're really a good listener.

1589
01:15:40.752 --> 01:15:41.585
Thank you.

1590
01:15:42.477 --> 01:15:43.939
- Who the fuck are you?

1591
01:15:43.939 --> 01:15:45.272
- What are you talking about?

1592
01:15:45.272 --> 01:15:47.062
- When did you fucking get here?

1593
01:15:47.062 --> 01:15:49.033
Why are you sitting with me?

1594
01:15:49.033 --> 01:15:51.080
We've been talking for
like half an hour.

1595
01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:52.109
I'm Joe.

1596
01:15:52.109 --> 01:15:55.340
- No. we have not been talking.

1597
01:15:55.340 --> 01:15:56.601
- Maybe we should stop on this.

1598
01:15:56.601 --> 01:16:00.749
- No. don't touch my fucking drink. Josh.

1599
01:16:00.749 --> 01:16:02.499
- Joe. Joe. remember?

1600
01:16:03.439 --> 01:16:04.439
Maybe water?

1601
01:16:05.693 --> 01:16:08.336
Kick out. maybe. some of that alcohol?

1602
01:16:08.336 --> 01:16:09.521
- No Jim. no.

1603
01:16:09.521 --> 01:16:10.354
- Joe.

1604
01:16:10.354 --> 01:16:13.565
- Do you think anybody
here is drinking water?

1605
01:16:13.565 --> 01:16:15.031
No. no.

1606
01:16:15.031 --> 01:16:17.946
Water is for fucking pussies.

1607
01:16:17.946 --> 01:16:19.037
Do I look like a pussy to you?

1608
01:16:19.037 --> 01:16:20.778
- No. you do not look like a pussy.

1609
01:16:20.778 --> 01:16:21.991
- No. exactly.

1610
01:16:21.991 --> 01:16:25.229
So. you know what sounds really good?

1611
01:16:25.229 --> 01:16:26.083
- What?

1612
01:16:26.083 --> 01:16:27.450
- Tequila shots.

1613
01:16:28.842 --> 01:16:32.203
Let's get some tequila shots up in here.

1614
01:16:32.203 --> 01:16:34.615
- You know what sounds better?

1615
01:16:34.615 --> 01:16:36.775
Maybe me taking you in. laying you down.

1616
01:16:36.775 --> 01:16:38.371
- Are you trying to sleep with me?

1617
01:16:38.371 --> 01:16:39.454
- No. no. no.

1618
01:16:40.387 --> 01:16:43.891
- Everybody. this guy's
trying to have sex with me.

1619
01:16:43.891 --> 01:16:46.407
- No. no. no. hashtag me too movement.

1620
01:16:46.407 --> 01:16:47.980
- Yes he is.

1621
01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:49.912
- I do not want to sleep with this woman.

1622
01:16:49.912 --> 01:16:52.412
nor have I touched this woman.

1623
01:16:54.684 --> 01:16:56.442
- You don't want to sleep with me?

1624
01:16:56.442 --> 01:17:00.221
- You need medication or
something. like pills?

1625
01:17:00.221 --> 01:17:01.866
Maybe that's what it
is. do you need pills?

1626
01:17:01.866 --> 01:17:03.379
- Are you a drug dealer?

1627
01:17:03.379 --> 01:17:04.212
- What?

1628
01:17:04.212 --> 01:17:05.295
- What kind of drugs do you sell?

1629
01:17:05.295 --> 01:17:07.639
'Cause that changes things a lot

1630
01:17:07.639 --> 01:17:10.215
about what we're talking about before.

1631
01:17:10.215 --> 01:17:11.575
- No. I don't want to sleep with you.

1632
01:17:11.575 --> 01:17:13.495
I do not want to sleep with you.

1633
01:17:13.495 --> 01:17:14.583
We were talking. remember?

1634
01:17:14.583 --> 01:17:16.327
Our problems?

1635
01:17:16.327 --> 01:17:19.626
- Oh yeah. you know what my problem is?

1636
01:17:19.626 --> 01:17:21.847
Those two fucking bitches over there

1637
01:17:21.847 --> 01:17:23.850
have been staring at me all night.

1638
01:17:23.850 --> 01:17:26.873
I don't know what their problem is.

1639
01:17:26.873 --> 01:17:28.218
- Sorry to tell you.

1640
01:17:28.218 --> 01:17:30.388
I don't see no bitches.

1641
01:17:30.388 --> 01:17:32.371
Open your eyes. Javier.

1642
01:17:32.371 --> 01:17:33.978
Those fucking bitches.

1643
01:17:50.966 --> 01:17:52.568
- What did you do to him?

1644
01:17:56.692 --> 01:17:57.728
- Get his legs.

1645
01:17:57.728 --> 01:17:59.003
- Can't get the leg.

1646
01:18:00.518 --> 01:18:01.601
- Oh my god. could you guys-

1647
01:18:03.631 --> 01:18:06.658
He is seriously hurt. can
someone get him a towel?

1648
01:18:13.016 --> 01:18:13.849
Someone call 9-1-1.

1649
01:18:13.849 --> 01:18:15.614
- Hi. 9-1-1?

1650
01:18:15.614 --> 01:18:18.362
There is a man. I mean-

1651
01:18:18.362 --> 01:18:19.902
- Looked like something was drippin' down-

1652
01:18:19.902 --> 01:18:21.070
- We need an ambulance.

1653
01:18:21.070 --> 01:18:23.114
- Hey. someone check and see if he's got

1654
01:18:23.114 --> 01:18:24.854
his package in the pool.

1655
01:18:24.854 --> 01:18:27.461
Hey. I think we
should take his pants off.

1656
01:18:27.461 --> 01:18:30.878
- Nevermind. you guys have great service.

1657
01:18:36.272 --> 01:18:37.438
- Oh my god.

1658
01:18:37.438 --> 01:18:39.415
She really got a stripper.

1659
01:18:39.415 --> 01:18:40.748
- What on earth?

1660
01:18:42.926 --> 01:18:43.759
- Not in my.

1661
01:18:44.592 --> 01:18:46.259
No. not in my mouth.

1662
01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:49.539
Hey. you sure
you got the right house?

1663
01:18:49.539 --> 01:18:50.372
Goddamn.

1664
01:18:50.372 --> 01:18:51.872
- This is awesome.

1665
01:18:52.752 --> 01:18:54.544
- No. not in my mouth. not in my mouth.

1666
01:18:56.648 --> 01:18:58.263
Dude. I thought you were vegan.

1667
01:19:01.728 --> 01:19:03.651
Who ordered this cop?

1668
01:19:12.869 --> 01:19:15.733
Somebody. please help me.

1669
01:19:18.808 --> 01:19:19.725
No. no. no.

1670
01:19:21.099 --> 01:19:22.440
- Whoa.

1671
01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:23.959
Woo.

1672
01:19:23.959 --> 01:19:27.752
All right. now we
should take his pants off.

1673
01:19:27.752 --> 01:19:31.140
- I was so freaking scared
when that happened right then.

1674
01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:33.716
Oh my god. is that Chris?

1675
01:19:33.716 --> 01:19:35.355
It's Craig.

1676
01:19:35.355 --> 01:19:36.188
Whatever.

1677
01:19:38.301 --> 01:19:39.384
- Is he dead?

1678
01:19:41.524 --> 01:19:43.426
- I mean. he could be.

1679
01:19:43.426 --> 01:19:45.308
He had the equivalent of 36 beers

1680
01:19:45.308 --> 01:19:47.975
in five minutes. all up his ass.

1681
01:19:50.796 --> 01:19:52.713
Well. what luck for us?

1682
01:19:54.352 --> 01:19:55.852
How serendipitous.

1683
01:19:57.244 --> 01:20:00.244
- Wait. can we check and see if he's

1684
01:20:01.601 --> 01:20:02.732
breathing?

1685
01:20:02.732 --> 01:20:05.208
- Well. he moved. so.

1686
01:20:05.208 --> 01:20:06.408
- Well. that's a good sign.

1687
01:20:06.408 --> 01:20:08.498
- He looks so cute when he's passed out.

1688
01:20:08.498 --> 01:20:11.478
- Thank god he's not dead.

1689
01:20:11.478 --> 01:20:14.196
- All right. well let's get
home and change our clothes

1690
01:20:14.196 --> 01:20:17.029
and get some coffee. or something.

1691
01:20:18.584 --> 01:20:20.805
Are you able to use my cup though?

1692
01:20:20.805 --> 01:20:22.607
- I think I can do that. sure.

1693
01:20:22.607 --> 01:20:25.404
- Okay. cool. just
trying to save the earth.

1694
01:20:25.404 --> 01:20:29.452
- I have to admit last
night was kind of fun.

1695
01:20:29.452 --> 01:20:31.535
- Well. I thought so too.

1696
01:20:33.437 --> 01:20:36.747
It wasn't my favorite
heist that I've ever done.

1697
01:20:36.747 --> 01:20:40.760
But I fucked over the
person that I hate the most.

1698
01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:42.367
- You hate Ethan the most?

1699
01:20:42.367 --> 01:20:43.599
- Yeah.

1700
01:20:43.599 --> 01:20:45.702
I mean. I love you the
most. Ethan's a dick

1701
01:20:45.702 --> 01:20:48.285
to you. so I hate him the most.

1702
01:20:50.079 --> 01:20:53.555
I'm just glad that you did this.

1703
01:20:53.555 --> 01:20:54.451
I did this.

1704
01:20:54.451 --> 01:20:55.284
- Yeah.

1705
01:20:56.688 --> 01:20:57.521
- If we ever pull off another

1706
01:20:57.521 --> 01:20:59.780
heist again. which I'm not condoning

1707
01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:03.179
- Only 13% of burglaries are ever solved.

1708
01:21:03.179 --> 01:21:06.886
- I really hope it's not
another one of my boyfriends.

1709
01:21:06.886 --> 01:21:08.019
- Sell the comic books.

1710
01:21:08.019 --> 01:21:08.852
- Okay.

1711
01:21:08.852 --> 01:21:11.604
- And then. we can get you
possibly like your own place.

1712
01:21:11.604 --> 01:21:15.937
Not that I don't love you
staying with me. but yeah.

1713
01:21:16.796 --> 01:21:19.524
- I can't believe you got me to do this.

1714
01:21:19.524 --> 01:21:22.199
- I'm a deep well of surprises. Autumn.

1715
01:21:22.199 --> 01:21:23.755
- You're so manipulative.

1716
01:21:23.755 --> 01:21:24.613
- What?
- Yes.

1717
01:21:24.613 --> 01:21:26.619
- I'm not manipulative.

1718
01:21:26.619 --> 01:21:28.717
I'm persuasive. okay?

1719
01:21:28.717 --> 01:21:32.943
And that happens to be a
really high-quality trait

1720
01:21:32.943 --> 01:21:35.164
that only charismatic people have.

1721
01:21:35.164 --> 01:21:39.497
Bad people are manipulative.
and I'm decent as fuck.

1722
01:21:40.939 --> 01:21:43.227
- Ethan could put two
and two together. though.

1723
01:21:43.227 --> 01:21:44.559
That's what I'm worried about.

1724
01:21:44.559 --> 01:21:45.392
What?

1725
01:21:45.392 --> 01:21:46.225
- Yes.

1726
01:21:46.225 --> 01:21:47.540
- You got Ethan a lot of credit

1727
01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:51.356
as a human. but he's not very smart.

1728
01:21:51.356 --> 01:21:53.952
Like. really not smart.

1729
01:21:53.952 --> 01:21:55.175
- I know.

1730
01:21:55.175 --> 01:21:59.021
That's why I'm worried
about this poor child.

1731
01:21:59.021 --> 01:22:00.641
- Yeah.

1732
01:22:11.142 --> 01:22:13.949
They took all my
games and all of my comics.

1733
01:22:13.949 --> 01:22:16.114
Shouldn't you be writing
this down. or something?

1734
01:22:16.114 --> 01:22:18.490
So. you're telling
me somebody's risked

1735
01:22:18.490 --> 01:22:21.142
going to prison to break into your home

1736
01:22:21.142 --> 01:22:24.939
to steal a Super Nintendo
that's worth maybe ten bucks?

1737
01:22:24.939 --> 01:22:26.145
- Yeah. look around.

1738
01:22:26.145 --> 01:22:29.251
You should be fingerprinting
and shit. anyway.

1739
01:22:40.711 --> 01:22:43.006
- What the hell is this?

1740
01:22:43.006 --> 01:22:43.974
What is that?

1741
01:22:43.974 --> 01:22:44.807
- Yeah.

1742
01:22:46.239 --> 01:22:48.395
Did you guys
bring that in here with you?

1743
01:22:48.395 --> 01:22:49.835
That's not my bag.

1744
01:22:49.835 --> 01:22:50.668
Sure. it isn't.

1745
01:22:50.668 --> 01:22:51.501
It's good.

1746
01:22:54.214 --> 01:22:56.303
Yeah. I'm going to need
a transport for one.

1747
01:22:56.303 --> 01:22:57.459
I have a narcotics bust.

1748
01:22:57.459 --> 01:22:58.471
- No. you don't.

1749
01:22:58.471 --> 01:22:59.406
It's not a bust.

1750
01:22:59.406 --> 01:23:01.178
You guys suck.

1751
01:23:06.775 --> 01:23:08.275
- No. you shut up.

1752
01:23:09.207 --> 01:23:11.040
No. you're the cutest.

1753
01:23:13.153 --> 01:23:15.775
Yeah. okay. no. I'll see you later.

1754
01:23:19.626 --> 01:23:21.852
Ugh. it's smells cat shit in here.

1755
01:23:22.685 --> 01:23:23.518
- It is.

1756
01:23:24.495 --> 01:23:25.940
- What?

1757
01:23:25.940 --> 01:23:28.646
- So. I got sick of Roy's shit.

1758
01:23:28.646 --> 01:23:30.146
- Wait. who's Roy?

1759
01:23:31.306 --> 01:23:35.236
- We work with him. we've
worked with him for five years.

1760
01:23:35.236 --> 01:23:37.084
- Oh. tall pervert guy?

1761
01:23:37.084 --> 01:23:37.917
- Yes.

1762
01:23:37.917 --> 01:23:38.750
- Oh. okay.
- Yes.

1763
01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:39.583
- Now I know who you're talking about.

1764
01:23:39.583 --> 01:23:42.250
- I made him a cat shit burrito.

1765
01:23:44.511 --> 01:23:46.975
- Oh. 'cause he's always
taking your burritos?

1766
01:23:46.975 --> 01:23:47.808
- Yes.

1767
01:23:48.997 --> 01:23:50.847
- And you thought of this all by yourself?

1768
01:23:50.847 --> 01:23:52.244
- Mmhmm.

1769
01:23:52.244 --> 01:23:53.744
- Oh my god. wow.

1770
01:23:55.215 --> 01:23:56.655
- Wait a minute.

1771
01:23:56.655 --> 01:23:57.995
Who were you on the phone with?

1772
01:23:57.995 --> 01:23:59.483
- Oh.

1773
01:23:59.483 --> 01:24:00.316
Greg.

1774
01:24:01.482 --> 01:24:02.924
- You mean Craig?

1775
01:24:02.924 --> 01:24:03.757
- No.

1776
01:24:03.757 --> 01:24:04.631
It turns out you've been saying

1777
01:24:04.631 --> 01:24:06.467
his name wrong the whole time.

1778
01:24:06.467 --> 01:24:08.967
It's Greg with a G. not Craig.

1779
01:24:10.659 --> 01:24:11.791
like how you've been saying it.

1780
01:24:11.791 --> 01:24:13.144
- Silly me.

1781
01:24:13.144 --> 01:24:14.619
- But don't worry. I won't tell him

1782
01:24:14.619 --> 01:24:18.002
that you didn't know his
name for a really long time.

1783
01:24:18.002 --> 01:24:18.982
- Thank you.

1784
01:24:19.815 --> 01:24:20.830
- Yeah.
- I appreciate that.

1785
01:24:20.830 --> 01:24:24.827
- We've been going steady
now for about a week.

1786
01:24:24.827 --> 01:24:26.884
- You're going steady with someone?

1787
01:24:26.884 --> 01:24:30.728
- He asked me to be his
official girlfriend.

1788
01:24:30.728 --> 01:24:31.603
- What?

1789
01:24:31.603 --> 01:24:34.185
- Yeah. all proper-like. so.

1790
01:24:34.185 --> 01:24:35.638
I dunno.
- Okay.

1791
01:24:35.638 --> 01:24:36.471
- Yeah. it's just weird.

1792
01:24:36.471 --> 01:24:39.554
Like. when I look at him. I don't see

1793
01:24:40.461 --> 01:24:42.878
just a pole that I can climb.

1794
01:24:43.763 --> 01:24:46.028
Do you know what I mean?

1795
01:24:46.028 --> 01:24:48.943
Like. sexually. like a poll
that I can get down on?

1796
01:24:48.943 --> 01:24:50.151
- I follow.

1797
01:24:50.151 --> 01:24:52.155
- I just wasn't sure if you got the-

1798
01:24:52.155 --> 01:24:53.684
- Yes.
- Sexual.

1799
01:24:53.684 --> 01:24:55.567
- Yes. I did.
- Just wanted to make sure.

1800
01:24:55.567 --> 01:24:57.905
When he talks. I hear him.

1801
01:24:57.905 --> 01:24:58.829
- Aw.

1802
01:24:58.829 --> 01:25:02.583
- He says these ideas.
and they're so dumb.

1803
01:25:02.583 --> 01:25:05.003
They're the worst ideas.

1804
01:25:05.003 --> 01:25:06.532
But I'm hearing them.

1805
01:25:06.532 --> 01:25:07.599
- You're listening.

1806
01:25:07.599 --> 01:25:08.432
- Yeah.

1807
01:25:08.432 --> 01:25:10.701
- You listen to someone.

1808
01:25:10.701 --> 01:25:11.534
- Yeah.

1809
01:25:11.534 --> 01:25:12.367
Well. shut up. no.

1810
01:25:12.367 --> 01:25:14.620
Stop. we're done.
- Look at you.

1811
01:25:15.453 --> 01:25:17.147
- What are you doing with that clipboard?

1812
01:25:17.147 --> 01:25:18.492
- Well. two things.

1813
01:25:18.492 --> 01:25:22.742
Number one. I wrote up
everything that Roy owes me.

1814
01:25:25.342 --> 01:25:26.175
- Wait.

1815
01:25:28.658 --> 01:25:29.908
This is $1.000.

1816
01:25:31.219 --> 01:25:33.081
- Compounded interest. though.

1817
01:25:33.081 --> 01:25:34.354
- Yikes.

1818
01:25:34.354 --> 01:25:36.666
Well. he deserves it.

1819
01:25:36.666 --> 01:25:39.790
Five years of borrowing dollars from you.

1820
01:25:39.790 --> 01:25:41.242
- Adds up.

1821
01:25:41.242 --> 01:25:43.113
- You're just like really standing up

1822
01:25:43.113 --> 01:25:45.269
for yourself. and I love it.

1823
01:25:45.269 --> 01:25:47.161
You have. like. a backbone now.

1824
01:25:47.161 --> 01:25:50.356
You're like a whole new woman.

1825
01:25:50.356 --> 01:25:51.189
- Go on.

1826
01:25:52.594 --> 01:25:54.461
- No. that's all I had.

1827
01:25:54.461 --> 01:25:55.428
- Okay.
- But I'm proud of you.

1828
01:25:55.428 --> 01:25:56.996
I can't believe it.

1829
01:25:56.996 --> 01:25:58.306
Whoa.

1830
01:25:58.306 --> 01:26:00.350
- The next part of it was.

1831
01:26:00.350 --> 01:26:03.498
I'm almost done packing up all my stuff.

1832
01:26:03.498 --> 01:26:04.331
- Oh.

1833
01:26:06.985 --> 01:26:08.485
I don't like that.

1834
01:26:11.294 --> 01:26:12.127
- What's going on?

1835
01:26:12.127 --> 01:26:13.694
- I don't know.

1836
01:26:13.694 --> 01:26:15.739
It's just. whenever you
talk about moving out.

1837
01:26:15.739 --> 01:26:18.072
it just makes me feel. like.

1838
01:26:20.645 --> 01:26:21.647
- Down?

1839
01:26:21.647 --> 01:26:23.207
- Yeah. like I'm sad.

1840
01:26:23.207 --> 01:26:25.009
I don't want you to leave.

1841
01:26:25.009 --> 01:26:27.268
- You're gonna miss me.

1842
01:26:27.268 --> 01:26:30.060
- No. I'm just. I'm not. no. stop it.

1843
01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:31.582
No. I'm not gonna miss you.

1844
01:26:31.582 --> 01:26:35.322
Just. it's nice having
you around sometimes.

1845
01:26:35.322 --> 01:26:36.519
- Aw.

1846
01:26:36.519 --> 01:26:38.234
- And you're not gonna be here anymore.

1847
01:26:38.234 --> 01:26:40.484
- No. I'll still come back.

1848
01:26:41.370 --> 01:26:42.922
- Like. all the time?

1849
01:26:42.922 --> 01:26:45.252
- As much as possible.

1850
01:26:45.252 --> 01:26:49.754
- Okay. so I mean. twice a
day is very easily possible.

1851
01:26:51.030 --> 01:26:53.591
- You're my best friend. of
course I'm gonna be here.

1852
01:26:53.591 --> 01:26:55.101
- Okay.

1853
01:26:55.101 --> 01:26:57.809
- And you're also the father of my child.

1854
01:26:57.809 --> 01:26:59.413
So. I'm going to be around a lot.

1855
01:26:59.413 --> 01:27:00.246
- Yeah.

1856
01:27:02.264 --> 01:27:04.114
I gotta get going.

1857
01:27:04.114 --> 01:27:07.401
- Oh. before you do. I need
that necklace you borrowed.

1858
01:27:07.401 --> 01:27:08.823
- Oh. yeah.

1859
01:27:09.958 --> 01:27:11.850
Oh. I put it in your drawer.

1860
01:27:11.850 --> 01:27:12.893
So.
- Oh.

1861
01:27:12.893 --> 01:27:14.665
You know. I'm surprised
you actually returned it.

1862
01:27:14.665 --> 01:27:15.498
- I know. right?

1863
01:27:15.498 --> 01:27:18.415
Like. I'm becoming a good person and shit.

1864
01:27:20.660 --> 01:27:22.125
Wow. I'm going to be late.

1865
01:27:22.125 --> 01:27:25.742
and I don't like to be late anymore.

1866
01:27:25.742 --> 01:27:27.819
Not even fashionably.

1867
01:27:27.819 --> 01:27:28.802
Stacy.

1868
01:27:28.802 --> 01:27:30.606
What. oh. what's that?

1869
01:27:30.606 --> 01:27:34.357
- What is this prank pregnancy test?

1870
01:27:34.357 --> 01:27:35.522
- What. how should I know?

1871
01:27:35.522 --> 01:27:36.522
You can't prove that's mine.

1872
01:27:36.522 --> 01:27:37.468
I don't know.

1873
01:27:37.468 --> 01:27:38.301
- Don't leave.

1874
01:27:38.301 --> 01:27:39.468
- No. I gotta.

1875
01:27:44.246 --> 01:27:45.709
What?

1876
01:27:45.709 --> 01:27:50.459
- Did you use this prank
pregnancy test for me to pee on?

1877
01:27:52.137 --> 01:27:53.101
- I'm sorry. okay?

1878
01:27:53.101 --> 01:27:55.226
I had a really good reason to. though.

1879
01:27:55.226 --> 01:27:57.921
I figured. if you got pregnant
that Ethan would dump you.

1880
01:27:57.921 --> 01:28:00.485
and then you would have to
realize like how amazing you are.

1881
01:28:00.485 --> 01:28:04.258
and you will grow into this
awesome person. which you did.

1882
01:28:04.258 --> 01:28:05.841
So. my plan worked.

1883
01:28:09.054 --> 01:28:11.221
- You planned all of this?

1884
01:28:13.141 --> 01:28:14.869
No. I mean. not all of it.

1885
01:28:14.869 --> 01:28:17.949
I didn't know that we were
gonna be doing a heist.

1886
01:28:17.949 --> 01:28:21.124
That was just a fun. little extra thing.

1887
01:28:21.124 --> 01:28:24.457
But yeah. everything else. I planned it.

1888
01:28:25.373 --> 01:28:29.233
- Do you realize how much
stress this put me through?

1889
01:28:29.233 --> 01:28:31.466
My cortisol levels are so high

1890
01:28:31.466 --> 01:28:35.511
that it induced pregnancy-like symptoms.

1891
01:28:35.511 --> 01:28:40.277
- Okay. well I'm sorry.
but in my defense. I wasn't

1892
01:28:40.277 --> 01:28:44.226
thinking about your feelings
at all when I planned this.

1893
01:28:44.226 --> 01:28:47.470
At least you have all
this newfound confidence.

1894
01:28:47.470 --> 01:28:49.649
And that's because of me.

1895
01:28:49.649 --> 01:28:51.232
I did that for you.

1896
01:28:52.442 --> 01:28:54.478
Anyways. you seem really angry.

1897
01:28:54.478 --> 01:28:55.610
- Yes.

1898
01:28:55.610 --> 01:28:58.922
- So. I'm just gonna give
you some time to simmer.

1899
01:28:58.922 --> 01:29:01.508
and I'll come back. and we
can talk about it later?

1900
01:29:01.508 --> 01:29:04.766
And I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

1901
01:29:04.766 --> 01:29:06.206
Even if there's a really good reason.

1902
01:29:06.206 --> 01:29:07.558
I won't do it again. I promise-

1903
01:29:07.558 --> 01:29:09.002
- Go.

1904
01:29:09.002 --> 01:29:11.730
- And you don't even look
half-bad in that shirt.

1905
01:29:11.730 --> 01:29:12.563
Love you.

1906
01:29:13.396 --> 01:29:15.602
Don't be mad at me.

1907
01:29:15.602 --> 01:29:16.435
- Stacy!

1908
01:30:03.615 --> 01:30:04.782
- Where is it?

1909
01:30:11.514 --> 01:30:12.347
Open.

1910
01:30:17.854 --> 01:30:18.771
Two. three.

1911
01:30:26.491 --> 01:30:28.899
No. I can't be pregnant.

1912
01:30:28.899 --> 01:30:33.510
It's probably menopause.
early. early menopause.

1913
01:30:33.510 --> 01:30:34.343
Come on.

1914
01:30:44.688 --> 01:30:45.938
Son of a bitch.

1915
01:31:34.604 --> 01:31:36.529
- I want you to take all your tension.

1916
01:31:36.529 --> 01:31:39.251
close your eyes with me.

1917
01:31:39.251 --> 01:31:43.084
Pretend you're on a
fluffy cloud with puppies.

1918
01:31:44.031 --> 01:31:45.994
- I can't have puppies
on the cloud with me.

1919
01:31:45.994 --> 01:31:50.994
- For this massage to work
you need to be quiet. okay?

1920
01:31:51.121 --> 01:31:52.981
Okay. you're on a deserted island

1921
01:31:52.981 --> 01:31:55.855
with only hot guys surrounding you.

1922
01:31:55.855 --> 01:31:59.772
and they have mimosas
and they are fanning you.

1923
01:32:00.895 --> 01:32:02.248
- Keep going.

1924
01:32:35.620 --> 01:32:39.054
- It has rotating wheels that wheel

1925
01:32:39.054 --> 01:32:42.757
around your body. relieving tension.

1926
01:32:42.757 --> 01:32:46.424
which actually will
help you release toxins.

1927
01:32:47.642 --> 01:32:51.468
- That sounds like gobbeldy-gook to me.

1928
01:32:52.770 --> 01:32:57.183
- Okay. so this is actually
a vibrating tool. that-

1929
01:32:57.183 --> 01:32:58.600
- Really?
- Mmhmm.

1930
01:33:00.693 --> 01:33:03.443
Yeah. doesn't that feel good?
