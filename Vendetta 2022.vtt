Mom's got dinner on the table.

be college scouts there.

So that's why we gotta win
to make it into the playoffs.

see such commitment.

I. we're not sure

24

you should be putting
softball first.

- But. Dad. I'm on honor roll.

26
00:01:34.195 --> 00:01:35.096

You don't have
to worry about me.

getting a real degree.

we're gonna win. so.

Great game. Coach!

53
00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:47.995
- I told you we were gonna win.

54
00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:49.096
- I didn't doubt you.

55
00:03:51.198 --> 00:03:53.167
You were amazing out there.

56
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.702
- Coach said all the
scouts were very impressed.

57
00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:57.171
- He did?

58
00:03:57.204 --> 00:03:59.572
Professional softball
player and a lawyer?

59
00:04:00.875 --> 00:04:03.911
I don't know. Kat. I'm
not sure you can do both.

60
00:04:03.944 --> 00:04:06.947
- You can. technically. but you
just want me to be a lawyer.

61
00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.658
- I just want you to have
a regular source of income.

62
00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:10.682
That's what I want.

63
00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:15.156
- If I get a scholarship.
I am saving you money.

64
00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:16.891
You should be happy about that.

65
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.228
- You make a very
good argument there.

66
00:04:21.262 --> 00:04:23.197
but it's not me
you gotta convince.

67
00:04:24.098 --> 00:04:25.765
It's your mother.

68
00:04:25.799 --> 00:04:27.168
- You always say that.

69
00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:29.270
- I always say it
'cause it's true.

70
00:04:29.303 --> 00:04:31.005
We only want the best for you.

71
00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.241
But you totally nailed it today.

72
00:04:34.275 --> 00:04:35.275
Thanks.

73
00:04:52.226 --> 00:04:53.226
- Be right back.

74
00:04:54.694 --> 00:04:55.734
Don't be taking off on me.

75
00:05:00.201 --> 00:05:02.103
Hey. you know what
you should be?

76
00:05:03.204 --> 00:05:04.805
A comedian.

77
00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:07.174
- If I left you here. what
would I eat for dinner?

78
00:05:07.208 --> 00:05:08.708
- Your mother's leftovers.

79
00:05:09.844 --> 00:05:12.313
- I ain't going
nowhere. I swear.

80
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.359
- Hey. Juana.
- Hey.

81
00:05:25.392 --> 00:05:26.193
- I've come to pick up.

82
00:05:26.227 --> 00:05:28.429
Taco Tuesday.

83
00:05:58.359 --> 00:06:00.361
Get out of the
fucking car now. get out!

84
00:06:02.196 --> 00:06:04.198
No. Dad. Dad!

85
00:06:04.231 --> 00:06:05.798
Bitch. I'll fucking shoot you.

86
00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:06.433
Dad!

87
00:06:06.467 --> 00:06:07.334
Shut the fuck up.

88
00:06:07.368 --> 00:06:08.368
- Dad!

89
00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.172
Don't look at me!

90
00:06:11.205 --> 00:06:12.205
- Dad!

91
00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:28.422
What do you want from me?

92
00:06:28.455 --> 00:06:30.433
Please. I don't have any
money. I don't have anything.

93
00:06:30.457 --> 00:06:32.126
Money?

94
00:06:35.196 --> 00:06:38.332
I don't want your
money. little girl.

95
00:06:38.365 --> 00:06:40.201
I want your soul.

96
00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:50.244
It's what Father wants.

97
00:06:51.312 --> 00:06:54.215
To become one of
us. to become it.

98
00:06:57.784 --> 00:07:00.354
- Great. got the
extra salsa and guac?

99
00:07:00.387 --> 00:07:02.323
Show me you want it.

100
00:07:02.356 --> 00:07:04.024
Show me.

101
00:07:05.226 --> 00:07:07.361
No. no. no. no. no!

102
00:07:07.394 --> 00:07:09.196
No!

103
00:07:21.208 --> 00:07:22.243
It's done.

104
00:07:24.245 --> 00:07:26.013
- Kat!

105
00:07:26.046 --> 00:07:27.147
We gotta go. brother.

106
00:07:27.181 --> 00:07:28.515
- Now.
- Kat!

107
00:07:58.979 --> 00:08:00.147
On the ground!

108
00:08:02.082 --> 00:08:03.082
- Kat!

109
00:08:16.196 --> 00:08:17.196
Help me!

110
00:08:27.207 --> 00:08:29.576
William!

111
00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:30.610
- Jen.

112
00:08:34.148 --> 00:08:35.282
- What happened?

113
00:08:37.651 --> 00:08:39.186
- They hurt her.

114
00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:44.091
- Are you okay?

115
00:08:51.632 --> 00:08:53.233
No. no. no. no. no.

116
00:08:56.236 --> 00:08:58.405
No. no.

117
00:09:02.943 --> 00:09:04.178
No. no.

118
00:09:04.211 --> 00:09:06.313
Oh. please. no. no. no.

119
00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:13.220
- The Eatonton Journal emailed.
asking for an interview.

120
00:09:16.023 --> 00:09:18.192
William. did you hear me?

121
00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:25.099
- I have to go meet with
the prosecuting attorney.

122
00:09:25.132 --> 00:09:26.367
- What do they want?

123
00:09:33.407 --> 00:09:34.617
In the
interest of getting this thug

124
00:09:34.641 --> 00:09:36.977
off the streets as
soon as possible.

125
00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:38.355
his attorneys agreed
to plead guilty

126
00:09:38.379 --> 00:09:40.147
to assaulting an officer.

127
00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:41.224
possession with the
intent to distribute.

128
00:09:41.248 --> 00:09:44.151
and resisting arrest. and
that's all in addition

129
00:09:44.184 --> 00:09:46.153
to his parole violations.

130
00:09:46.186 --> 00:09:47.621
We're looking at five to seven.

131
00:09:50.391 --> 00:09:51.358
- Years. that's it?

132
00:09:51.392 --> 00:09:53.427
- If he keeps clean. he
could be out in three.

133
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.396
but. yes. that's what
it's looking like.

134
00:09:57.197 --> 00:09:59.066
- This kid murdered my daughter.

135
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:05.305
He should be executed or
life in jail. no parole.

136
00:10:05.672 --> 00:10:09.176
- Mr. Duncan. we've got
no video. no photos.

137
00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.179
no eyewitnesses except you.

138
00:10:12.212 --> 00:10:14.214
You got a concussion
during the struggle.

139
00:10:15.082 --> 00:10:17.618
You want everything
riding on an eye test.

140
00:10:17.651 --> 00:10:19.186
some optometrist
they put on the stand

141
00:10:19.219 --> 00:10:21.989
who's gonna say you were
in shock and hallucinating?

142
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:24.158
- I know what I saw.

143
00:10:24.191 --> 00:10:26.160
- Your biggest problem
is that there's no gun.

144
00:10:26.193 --> 00:10:28.128
- Well. they took it.

145
00:10:28.162 --> 00:10:29.162
- Who's they?

146
00:10:30.364 --> 00:10:32.166
I'm just saying what
they're gonna say.

147
00:10:32.199 --> 00:10:34.101
Look. if you wanna
try to convince the DA

148
00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:36.170
to take this to trial.
you're welcome to.

149
00:10:36.203 --> 00:10:37.380
But this case is so paper thin.

150
00:10:37.404 --> 00:10:39.106
the judge is probably
gonna throw it out.

151
00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:42.176
and Danny Fetter is gonna
be back on the streets.

152
00:10:42.209 --> 00:10:45.078
At least this way. he's
off for a good few years.

153
00:10:45.112 --> 00:10:46.523
Basically. it's your
word against his.

154
00:10:46.547 --> 00:10:48.649
- It's bullshit is what it is.

155
00:10:48.682 --> 00:10:50.184
It's bullshit. and you know it!

156
00:10:50.217 --> 00:10:52.419
- I'm not disagreeing
with you. Mr. Duncan.

157
00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.222
but I gotta be honest.
I had to schmooze

158
00:10:55.255 --> 00:10:57.424
the judge to agree to
half those charges.

159
00:10:57.458 --> 00:11:00.427
The plea deal makes the
most sense. trust me.

160
00:11:03.263 --> 00:11:06.166
And that night. outside
the Mexican restaurant

161
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.001
that you and your
daughter visited.

162
00:11:08.035 --> 00:11:09.646
can you point out the
attacker that you saw

163
00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:11.205
and physically fought with?

164
00:11:21.615 --> 00:11:23.016
- No.

165
00:11:23.684 --> 00:11:24.684
Settle.

166
00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:28.489
- Not sure I can
confidently identify

167
00:11:28.522 --> 00:11:31.425
that man as the
attacker. Your Honor.

168
00:11:32.526 --> 00:11:33.794
- What the fuck are you doing?

169
00:11:33.828 --> 00:11:37.197
- Mr. Duncan. are
you absolutely sure

170
00:11:37.231 --> 00:11:40.234
that you cannot confidently
point out the attacker?

171
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:46.673
- Yes. Your Honor.
I'm 100% sure.

172
00:11:46.707 --> 00:11:49.176
- Mr. Fetter. you
are free to go.

173
00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:53.180
I see no reason to further
waste this court's time.

174
00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:56.683
Case dismissed.

175
00:12:20.507 --> 00:12:23.210
- I'm so fucking proud of you.

176
00:12:23.978 --> 00:12:26.380
You can do anything in
this life. you know that?

177
00:12:29.316 --> 00:12:31.184
You can do anything.

178
00:12:34.187 --> 00:12:35.187
I love you.

179
00:12:36.356 --> 00:12:37.356
Come on.

180
00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:57.544
- You did good.

181

that Danny Fetter was
murdered last night.

310
00:25:02.936 --> 00:25:03.936
- Oh.

311
00:25:06.206 --> 00:25:09.076
Well. how did it happen?

312
00:25:09.109 --> 00:25:10.109
- Not sure yet.

313
00:25:10.744 --> 00:25:12.913
What were you doing
last night. Mr. Duncan?

314
00:25:14.081 --> 00:25:15.081
- I was here.

315
00:25:15.683 --> 00:25:19.153
I mean. I went for a
walk. but I was here.

316
00:25:19.186 --> 00:25:21.155
- Yeah. he was here.

317
00:25:22.189 --> 00:25:23.390
- Am I a suspect. Detective?

318
00:25:24.625 --> 00:25:26.093
- At this point. I can't say.

319
00:25:26.126 --> 00:25:27.628
- I didn't kill him.

320
00:25:27.661 --> 00:25:29.430
- Sure. I understand
what you're saying.

321
00:25:31.398 --> 00:25:33.367
- You have any idea who did?

322
00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:37.037
- No. but all of
those Fetter boys

323
00:25:37.071 --> 00:25:39.440
run in some dicey circles.
so we got a few leads.

324
00:25:42.142 --> 00:25:46.480
- Well. I wish we could help.

325
00:25:47.648 --> 00:25:49.116

326
00:25:49.149 --> 00:25:52.152
are going through our
own grief right now. so.

327
00:25:52.953 --> 00:25:55.122
- Well. I'll let you
know if there is.

329

you think of anything

330
00:25:59.626 --> 00:26:01.495
that might be helpful.

331
00:26:01.528 --> 00:26:04.531
and don't leave town without
letting me know. okay?

332
00:26:04.565 --> 00:26:06.633
Might have a few more questions.

333
00:26:06.667 --> 00:26:07.667

334
00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:20.681

Where were you last night?

337
00:26:29.156 --> 00:26:30.367
- I just said. I
went for a walk.

338
00:26:30.391 --> 00:26:32.459
- You never just go for a walk.

339
00:26:34.161 --> 00:26:37.164
- Well. I've also never had
my only child murdered before.

340
00:26:38.532 --> 00:26:41.034
- I don't want you to
go back to how you were.

341
00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:44.638
- What does that mean?

342
00:26:44.671 --> 00:26:46.349
You mean when I had bullets
flying around my head

343
00:26:46.373 --> 00:26:49.009
and my best friends were
dying all around me?

344
00:26:49.042 --> 00:26:50.042
Is that what you meant?

345
00:26:51.178 --> 00:26:52.178
This is different.

346
00:26:54.615 --> 00:26:55.615
It's our daughter.

347
00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:04.390
You know what?

348
00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.995
I can't believe
you'd even say that.

349
00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:17.738

350
00:27:17.771 --> 00:27:18.771

that you're drinking?

362
00:27:51.171 --> 00:27:52.439
Is he under this table?

363
00:27:53.307 --> 00:27:54.708
Huh. are you him?

364
00:27:55.576 --> 00:27:59.046
Do you plan on finding
him while you're sitting

365
00:27:59.079 --> 00:28:00.647
on your fat fucking
ass. drinking?

366
00:28:01.381 --> 00:28:03.150
- The girls was out
all night last night.

367
00:28:03.183 --> 00:28:04.718
Maybe they saw something.

368
00:28:04.751 --> 00:28:07.020
You know what I'm saying?

369
00:28:09.189 --> 00:28:10.189
- Ask 'em.

370
00:28:11.658 --> 00:28:12.658
Yeah. now.

371
00:28:14.194 --> 00:28:15.194
- Yeah.

372
00:28:20.167 --> 00:28:23.370
Yo. yo. girls. get
off the fucking pole!

373
00:28:23.403 --> 00:28:24.403
Come here!

374
00:28:25.372 --> 00:28:26.773
Hurry up. come on now!

375
00:28:28.709 --> 00:28:29.709
Come on.

376
00:28:30.444 --> 00:28:31.645
Shit.

377
00:28:35.148 --> 00:28:38.418
Y'all see anything strange
out here last night?

378
00:28:38.452 --> 00:28:39.452
Huh?

379
00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.221
- Yeah. I saw a guy.

380
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:44.124
- Oh. yeah?

381
00:28:44.157 --> 00:28:45.425
- Yeah.

382
00:28:45.459 --> 00:28:46.760
Seemed kinda out of place.

383
00:28:48.095 --> 00:28:49.429
- Really?

384
00:28:49.463 --> 00:28:51.131
Come with me.

385
00:28:51.164 --> 00:28:52.533
Come on!

386
00:28:52.566 --> 00:28:53.700
Come on. shit.

387
00:28:55.502 --> 00:28:58.472
Tell him. tell him
what you told me.

388
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:14.555
- There was this one white
guy. dressed real well.

389
00:29:14.588 --> 00:29:18.125
like a businessman.
just waiting in his car.

390
00:29:18.158 --> 00:29:22.062
I went up to him. but he
wasn't there to party.

391
00:29:23.397 --> 00:29:27.869
Looked kinda nervous.
actually. real intense.

392
00:29:27.902 --> 00:29:28.902
- Hmm.

393
00:29:31.705 --> 00:29:32.705
Hold that.

394
00:29:40.848 --> 00:29:43.350
Is that him. is that the
man you almost serviced?

395
00:29:44.418 --> 00:29:47.187
- That's him. definitely.

396
00:29:52.159 --> 00:29:54.628
William Duncan.

397
00:29:58.165 --> 00:29:59.199
- It's the dad.

398
00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:05.505
It's the father of the
little girl that Danny did.

399
00:30:11.178 --> 00:30:14.147
Get everyone. everyone.

400
00:30:15.582 --> 00:30:17.517
I want to go hunting.

401
00:30:51.218 --> 00:30:54.221
I spy with my little
eye a dead guy.

402
00:30:55.789 --> 00:30:56.789
Gotcha.

403
00:31:32.994 --> 00:31:33.995
Get up.

404
00:32:03.057 --> 00:32:05.659
That was exciting.
William Duncan.

405
00:32:06.994 --> 00:32:08.996
That's right. I know your name.

406
00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:11.966
I know everything about you.

407
00:32:15.002 --> 00:32:16.971
- What do you want?

408
00:32:17.004 --> 00:32:17.939
- What do I want?

409
00:32:17.972 --> 00:32:20.474
I want you to not exist anymore.

410
00:32:22.676 --> 00:32:23.777
I wanna watch you die.

411
00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:26.981
You killed my brother.

412
00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:29.850
I want revenge.

413
00:32:47.334 --> 00:32:48.970
- Please. please.

414
00:32:49.003 --> 00:32:51.404
Please. please. please.

415
00:33:09.991 --> 00:33:11.324
Hey!

416
00:33:11.358 --> 00:33:12.592
There's a shooter!

417
00:33:12.626 --> 00:33:13.794
There's a shooter!

418
00:33:14.694 --> 00:33:15.328
There's a shooter!

419
00:33:15.362 --> 00:33:16.563
There's a guy on the ground!

420
00:33:16.596 --> 00:33:17.664
I think he got shot!

421
00:33:24.806 --> 00:33:26.339
- Right there. right there.

422
00:33:35.149 --> 00:33:36.583
- Are you at home?

423
00:33:36.616 --> 00:33:38.451
Lock all the doors and windows.

424
00:33:38.485 --> 00:33:39.719
Just do it!

425
00:33:39.753 --> 00:33:41.989
I'll explain it all
when I get home.

426
00:33:51.032 --> 00:33:51.999
- Get back inside the house!
- What's going on?

427
00:33:52.033 --> 00:33:52.834
Why. what?

428
00:33:52.867 --> 00:33:53.867
- Inside!

429
00:34:01.741 --> 00:34:03.010
- What the hell is going on?

430
00:34:04.011 --> 00:34:05.679
- Some people tried to kill me.

431
00:34:06.746 --> 00:34:07.982
- What. why?

432
00:34:08.015 --> 00:34:09.951
Does it matter?

433
00:34:11.451 --> 00:34:13.120
- You need to call
that detective.

434
00:34:17.524 --> 00:34:18.725
Call.

435
00:34:29.536 --> 00:34:30.972
- Well. the prints came back.

436
00:34:31.839 --> 00:34:35.408
The Vic is a Jason
Ditman. aka Henley.

437
00:34:37.111 --> 00:34:38.645
- Henley.

438
00:34:38.678 --> 00:34:40.014
How do I know that name?

439
00:34:40.047 --> 00:34:41.648
- He's one of Rory
Fetter's boys.

440
00:34:43.583 --> 00:34:45.019
- What the hell is going on?

441
00:34:51.458 --> 00:34:52.458
This is Neil Chen.

442
00:34:53.727 --> 00:34:56.030
- Detective. it's
William Duncan.

443
00:34:57.965 --> 00:34:59.200
- William Duncan.

444
00:34:59.233 --> 00:35:01.168
I was just thinking about you.

445
00:35:01.202 --> 00:35:02.202
What's up?

446
00:35:03.104 --> 00:35:05.605
- I need you to
come to the house.

447
00:35:08.042 --> 00:35:09.643
- Yeah. I'll be right there.

448
00:35:13.647 --> 00:35:14.748
Excuse me.

449
00:35:14.781 --> 00:35:15.950
You can try to spin this.

450
00:35:15.983 --> 00:35:17.784
but I know you
killed Danny Fetter.

451
00:35:19.987 --> 00:35:21.055
I know why you did it.

452
00:35:21.989 --> 00:35:23.590
I honestly don't even blame you.

453
00:35:26.027 --> 00:35:26.994
I'm pretty sure
that it'll shake out

454
00:35:27.028 --> 00:35:28.148
that you killed Henley. too.

455
00:35:28.829 --> 00:35:31.832
That dead guy. from
like an hour ago?

456
00:35:35.236 --> 00:35:38.039
You can give me the silent
treatment all you want.

457
00:35:38.072 --> 00:35:40.207
There is no other
reason why Rory Fetter

458
00:35:40.241 --> 00:35:42.009
would be so gung-ho to kill you.

459
00:35:42.043 --> 00:35:43.677
You know damn well
you started a war.

460
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:44.979
Now you want me to help you.

461
00:35:45.012 --> 00:35:46.047
I don't know if I can.

462
00:35:47.982 --> 00:35:49.050
Why should I help you?

463
00:35:51.953 --> 00:35:53.263
- I don't want my
wife to get hurt.

464
00:35:53.287 --> 00:35:54.889
- You should've thought
about that before

465
00:35:54.922 --> 00:35:57.024
you went and got your revenge.

466
00:35:57.058 --> 00:35:58.758
What'd you think
was gonna happen?

467
00:36:05.299 --> 00:36:09.502
Marine Corps Commendation
Medal. Iraq. Afghanistan.

468
00:36:11.172 --> 00:36:13.506
Looks like you know
how to handle yourself.

469
00:36:15.608 --> 00:36:16.944
- That was a long time ago.

470
00:36:17.945 --> 00:36:19.246
- This is where it's at now.

471
00:36:21.048 --> 00:36:23.616
You picked a hell of a
crew to start a fight with.

472
00:36:29.156 --> 00:36:31.826
Got a squad car
outside all night.

473
00:36:31.859 --> 00:36:33.626
You'll be safe.

474
00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:35.062
This is far from over.

475
00:36:36.696 --> 00:36:37.874
I'll be back tomorrow
with a lot more questions.

476
00:36:37.898 --> 00:36:39.934
and I want answers.

477
00:36:39.967 --> 00:36:41.634
You're gonna have to
start talking to me.

478
00:36:41.668 --> 00:36:42.769
or to a judge.

479
00:37:17.071 --> 00:37:20.074
- Nice wheels. goddamn!

480
00:37:20.774 --> 00:37:22.609
- Well. I figured you'd
pay me extra for it.

481
00:37:22.642 --> 00:37:24.879
- You're funny.
you're very funny.

482
00:37:24.912 --> 00:37:25.980
No. I'm serious.

483
00:37:26.013 --> 00:37:28.615
- I'm just so glad you made
it. right on time. man.

484
00:37:28.648 --> 00:37:32.619
The boat to Sierra Leone is
leaving in about 15 minutes.

485
00:37:32.652 --> 00:37:34.021
- Well. break me off. man.

486
00:37:34.055 --> 00:37:36.023
That thing's worth at least 20.

487
00:37:36.057 --> 00:37:37.992
Shit. the sticker says 70.

488
00:37:38.025 --> 00:37:39.960
- I get paid when
the boat leaves.

489
00:37:39.994 --> 00:37:42.029
I don't get paid. all right.

490
00:37:42.063 --> 00:37:43.030
You can still pay me. man.

491
00:37:43.064 --> 00:37:44.231
I know you got it.

492
00:37:44.265 --> 00:37:47.068
- I don't get paid til the
fucking car's in the container.

493
00:37:47.101 --> 00:37:48.635
- Fuck that.
- Come on.

494
00:37:48.668 --> 00:37:50.304
- I'm not gonna Uber
home with nothing.

495
00:37:50.337 --> 00:37:51.806
You know what. put
some plates on it.

496
00:37:51.839 --> 00:37:53.083
I'll drive this
fucking thing home.

497
00:37:53.107 --> 00:37:54.942
- Hey. wait a minute.
wait a minute.

498
00:37:55.608 --> 00:37:57.577
You're not going
home with nothing.

499
00:37:58.279 --> 00:38:00.147
See. you're not going
home with nothing.

500
00:38:00.181 --> 00:38:01.181
- What's this?

501
00:38:03.084 --> 00:38:05.052
What it look like?

502
00:38:05.086 --> 00:38:06.126
- It looks like an insult.

503
00:38:07.321 --> 00:38:09.323
- Oh. okay. okay.

504
00:38:14.061 --> 00:38:15.830
- I'll take that Mercedes.

505
00:38:15.863 --> 00:38:17.697
- It belongs to somebody.

506
00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:18.899
- So did that.

507
00:38:18.933 --> 00:38:20.493
I'm sure that belonged
to somebody. too.

508
00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:24.238
- Please. indulge.

509
00:38:30.244 --> 00:38:32.679
That's a lot of fucking
money on the street.

510
00:38:37.451 --> 00:38:38.451
- Looks Chinese.

511
00:38:40.054 --> 00:38:42.755
- That's a better market.
- Yeah.

512
00:38:42.789 --> 00:38:43.789
Fuck.

513
00:38:47.428 --> 00:38:48.428
You owe me. man.

514
00:38:49.964 --> 00:38:51.899
- I know. I know. I know.

515
00:38:51.932 --> 00:38:52.932
Thank you very much.

516
00:38:53.934 --> 00:38:55.768
You owe me!

517
00:39:20.261 --> 00:39:22.062
- You're drinking?

518
00:39:22.096 --> 00:39:23.096
- Yep.

519
00:39:24.465 --> 00:39:26.367
- You need to tell
me what's going on.

520
00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:34.208
- If you knew. you wouldn't
look at me the same way again.

521
00:39:35.342 --> 00:39:39.079
- William. hey. I love you.

522
00:39:41.048 --> 00:39:43.918
You are my husband. and
whatever's going on.

523
00:39:43.951 --> 00:39:45.052
we are in it together.

524
00:39:48.822 --> 00:39:51.292
- I feel like I'm right
back in the Middle East

525
00:39:51.325 --> 00:39:52.426
in a fucking war zone.

526
00:39:53.127 --> 00:39:55.029
- What are you talking about?

527
00:39:55.062 --> 00:39:57.464
- You don't wanna
know. Jen. you don't.

528
00:39:58.465 --> 00:40:00.034
- I do.

529
00:40:06.507 --> 00:40:07.507
- I killed him.

530
00:40:10.077 --> 00:40:12.947
I killed Danny Fetter.

531
00:40:17.952 --> 00:40:19.853
He took our baby away.

532
00:40:19.887 --> 00:40:23.490
He was gonna go away for
five to seven years. maximum.

533
00:40:24.525 --> 00:40:26.026
It wasn't fair.

534
00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:26.961
- William-
- It wasn't fair!

535
00:40:26.994 --> 00:40:28.462
William. I don't know what you.

536
00:40:33.467 --> 00:40:35.336
- And now the rest
of them want my head.

537
00:40:35.369 --> 00:40:36.837
- Well. do we need to leave?

538
00:40:38.072 --> 00:40:39.139
- Where are we gonna go?

539
00:40:39.173 --> 00:40:41.117
- Yeah. well. we can't
stay here if it's not safe.

540
00:40:41.141 --> 00:40:42.409
- There's a squad car outside.

541
00:40:42.443 --> 00:40:46.046
We'll be fine. but first
thing in the morning.

542
00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:48.082
go to your folks. at
least for tonight.

543
00:40:54.088 --> 00:40:55.198
- And I take it
back to the store.

544
00:40:55.222 --> 00:40:58.025
and I tell this moron kid
like. "Hey. broke again."

545
00:40:58.726 --> 00:41:01.395
And this dummy kid says I
didn't install it properly

546
00:41:01.428 --> 00:41:04.031
and because I. oh shit!

547
00:41:04.064 --> 00:41:05.299
No fucking way!

548
00:41:06.934 --> 00:41:09.036
That prick threw the
fucking bottle at us.

549
00:41:18.412 --> 00:41:19.480
- Why did they leave?

550
00:41:23.884 --> 00:41:25.953
Hello. hello.

551
00:41:34.295 --> 00:41:35.929
- Don't make that phone call.

552
00:41:36.864 --> 00:41:37.864
- Give me the phones.

553
00:41:39.066 --> 00:41:40.567
Give me the phone!

554
00:41:41.869 --> 00:41:42.869
Both of you.

555
00:41:43.604 --> 00:41:44.604
Yours.

556
00:41:46.106 --> 00:41:47.106
Thank you.

557
00:41:48.075 --> 00:41:49.910
- Can I call you Bill?

558
00:41:49.943 --> 00:41:50.943
William?

559
00:41:51.412 --> 00:41:53.047
How about Willy?

560
00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:55.482
- I don't know. Donnie.
whatever you prefer.

561
00:41:57.484 --> 00:41:58.484
- I like Willy.

562
00:41:59.386 --> 00:42:01.055
- Yeah.

563
00:42:01.088 --> 00:42:02.088
Rory.

564
00:42:04.491 --> 00:42:06.927
- Don't believe
everything you read.

565
00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.862
I'm a very nice guy.

566
00:42:08.896 --> 00:42:11.165
- Listen. this is just
between you and me.

567
00:42:12.433 --> 00:42:13.834
Leave my wife out of it.

568
00:42:14.902 --> 00:42:18.072
- Jen. go. go-
- No. no. no.

569
00:42:18.105 --> 00:42:23.077
- It's about quality time
with family. right. Jennifer?

570
00:42:23.544 --> 00:42:25.579
Or Jenny. Jen?

571
00:42:28.515 --> 00:42:33.253
Did you know that your
husband killed my son?

572
00:42:33.287 --> 00:42:36.123
- Only because your
son killed my daughter.

573
00:42:36.156 --> 00:42:37.624
- Well. he was my son.

574
00:42:40.027 --> 00:42:43.030
- Why do you look so
angry. William. huh?

575
00:42:44.498 --> 00:42:46.100
You're the one who
did the killing.

576
00:42:47.101 --> 00:42:48.235
Don't be angry.

577
00:42:48.268 --> 00:42:49.403
It'll all be over soon.

578
00:42:54.541 --> 00:42:57.544
- You got the good shit. fancy.

579
00:42:58.512 --> 00:43:00.214
We drink cheap shit.

580
00:43:01.115 --> 00:43:03.050
I like the gasoline taste.

581
00:43:04.184 --> 00:43:05.686
But that's just me.

582
00:43:11.091 --> 00:43:13.127
No. goddamn!

583
00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:17.631
- No. no. no. no. no. sit down.

584
00:43:17.664 --> 00:43:21.568
Get down. no. no. no. no.
Willy. down on your knees.

585
00:43:21.602 --> 00:43:22.236
She had nothing to do with it.

586
00:43:22.269 --> 00:43:24.471
- Beg for your fucking life.

587
00:43:24.505 --> 00:43:25.639
- Say hello to my son.

588
00:43:48.362 --> 00:43:50.397
- Do you see the light. Willy?

589
00:43:50.431 --> 00:43:55.436
Is it everything they
say it is. huh. huh?

590
00:43:57.104 --> 00:43:59.573
I can't wait to celebrate death.

591
00:44:01.542 --> 00:44:05.546
For now. I act as
its executioner.

592
00:44:07.047 --> 00:44:08.115
- Fuck you.

593
00:44:08.148 --> 00:44:10.451
- Mm. that's what you wanna
use as your last words?

594
00:44:12.219 --> 00:44:13.454
You should enjoy this.

595
00:45:14.114 --> 00:45:16.350
911. what's your emergency?

596
00:45:17.317 --> 00:45:20.053
- Hello?
- Help.

597
00:45:20.087 --> 00:45:20.922
- Sir?
- Help.

598
00:45:20.955 --> 00:45:23.090
Sir. are you all right?

599
00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:41.843
- Mr. Duncan. oh.
God. Mr. Duncan!

600
00:45:41.876 --> 00:45:43.410
You're gonna injure yourself.

601
00:45:43.443 --> 00:45:44.478
Here. come on.

602
00:45:44.511 --> 00:45:47.614
Let's get up. let's get
you back in bed. come on.

603
00:45:47.648 --> 00:45:51.084
Help. help. help. help.
I need some help in here!

604
00:45:51.118 --> 00:45:52.252
Oh. easy.

605
00:45:52.286 --> 00:45:54.087
- Help!
- It's okay.

606
00:45:54.121 --> 00:45:54.755
Calm down.

607
00:45:54.788 --> 00:45:56.123
- calm down.
- Why?

608
00:45:56.156 --> 00:45:58.225
Doctor. Doctor!

609
00:45:58.258 --> 00:46:01.094
It's okay. easy. easy.

610
00:46:01.128 --> 00:46:02.596
- Okay. help me strap him in.

611
00:46:02.629 --> 00:46:04.097
He's having a manic episode.

612
00:46:04.131 --> 00:46:05.131
Come on. sir.

613
00:46:05.833 --> 00:46:08.135
10 milligrams Haloperidol.

614
00:46:09.503 --> 00:46:11.371
- Got it!
- And get some ketamine.

615
00:46:11.405 --> 00:46:13.507
Breathe with me. come on. sir.

616
00:46:15.442 --> 00:46:17.544
It's gonna make you
feel better. calm down.

617
00:46:20.815 --> 00:46:22.182
- I don't wanna be alive.

618
00:46:22.215 --> 00:46:23.450
You are alive.

619
00:46:25.619 --> 00:46:27.154
- I don't wanna be.

620
00:46:41.234 --> 00:46:42.904
- Look at the miracle man.

621
00:46:42.937 --> 00:46:43.937
- Miracle?

622
00:46:44.906 --> 00:46:46.139
- You're still alive.

623
00:46:48.208 --> 00:46:49.208
- Yeah.

624
00:46:50.711 --> 00:46:52.145
- So. is it over?

625
00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:54.681
- Okay. let's give
this a try. okay?

626
00:46:55.616 --> 00:46:58.151
Come on. take it slow. no rush.

627
00:46:58.953 --> 00:46:59.953
Good start.

628
00:47:03.925 --> 00:47:04.892
- Sure.

629
00:47:04.926 --> 00:47:07.794
One step at
a time. there you go.

630
00:47:07.829 --> 00:47:08.896
Baby steps. no rush.

631
00:47:10.965 --> 00:47:11.933
Good.

632
00:47:11.966 --> 00:47:13.667
- Somehow. I don't believe you.

633
00:47:16.938 --> 00:47:18.672
I don't even think
you believe you.

634
00:47:22.242 --> 00:47:26.146
There's gonna be a
photo with you dead

635
00:47:27.949 --> 00:47:29.149
if you keep going.

636
00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:31.785
Yeah.

637
00:47:32.854 --> 00:47:33.921
There you go.

638
00:47:34.922 --> 00:47:36.790
One step at a time.

639
00:47:36.824 --> 00:47:38.492
- We both know that.

640
00:47:41.929 --> 00:47:43.697
It's your choice.

641
00:47:58.946 --> 00:48:02.884
- Okay. looking good.

642
00:48:02.917 --> 00:48:04.886
Looking really good. Will.

643
00:48:04.919 --> 00:48:05.853
- You don't have to lie to me.

644
00:48:05.887 --> 00:48:08.890
- I'm not lying to you.
you're doing great.

645
00:48:08.923 --> 00:48:11.425
You're gonna be outta
here before you know it.

646
00:48:14.862 --> 00:48:17.230
- Yeah. that's the plan.

647
00:49:55.362 --> 00:49:56.429
- That's fucked. man.

648
00:49:57.899 --> 00:49:59.566
Somebody's luggage and shit.

649
00:51:10.004 --> 00:51:11.806
Hey. yo!

650
00:51:11.839 --> 00:51:14.175
Who are you?

651
00:51:14.208 --> 00:51:16.878
Hey!

652
00:51:16.911 --> 00:51:18.179
Who are you?

653
00:51:18.212 --> 00:51:18.846
Hey!

654
00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:20.948
I asked you a question. man.

655
00:51:20.982 --> 00:51:21.916
- I don't want any trouble.

656
00:51:21.949 --> 00:51:23.050
I'm nobody.

657
00:51:23.084 --> 00:51:25.052
- Motherfucker. why you lying?

658
00:51:25.086 --> 00:51:26.988
Shit. you think I'm stupid?

659
00:51:27.021 --> 00:51:28.823
Come here. hey!

660
00:51:28.856 --> 00:51:29.856
Check this out.

661
00:51:31.225 --> 00:51:32.225
That's you.

662
00:51:35.963 --> 00:51:36.964
What are you doing here?

663
00:51:38.199 --> 00:51:38.798
- It's been a long day.

664
00:51:38.833 --> 00:51:40.134
I don't want any trouble.

665
00:51:40.167 --> 00:51:41.735
- Oh. looks like
you got it. man.

666
00:51:41.768 --> 00:51:43.804
Plenty of trouble
from what I can see.

667
00:51:43.838 --> 00:51:46.007
You in hot water with
them Fetter boys. huh?

668
00:51:47.909 --> 00:51:49.977
Yeah. maybe I can help you.

669
00:51:52.013 --> 00:51:53.680
- I don't need any help. either.

670
00:51:53.713 --> 00:51:55.415
- Okay. Willy. all right.

671
00:51:56.951 --> 00:51:57.951
You do you.

672
00:52:03.690 --> 00:52:04.959
- You know what?

673
00:52:06.093 --> 00:52:10.164
You know where I can get a gun?

674
00:52:13.968 --> 00:52:16.469
- Motherfucker.
step into my office.

675
00:52:16.503 --> 00:52:20.674
Yeah. I had a little run-in
myself with them Fetter boys.

676
00:52:20.707 --> 00:52:22.810
Yeah. you know what
I'm talking about.

677
00:52:22.843 --> 00:52:24.946
Rory. yeah.

678
00:52:24.979 --> 00:52:30.117
Motherfucker shot me. yeah.
right here. in the shoulder.

679
00:52:30.151 --> 00:52:31.218
Three years ago.

680
00:52:33.988 --> 00:52:35.056
Motherfucking asshole.

681
00:52:35.089 --> 00:52:36.958
Then he killed my
fucking cousin.

682
00:52:37.992 --> 00:52:40.161
Fuck. man. hate them guys.

683
00:52:42.997 --> 00:52:46.901
Yeah. it all comes down to
pain and pleasure. my man.

684
00:52:48.169 --> 00:52:49.236
- Pain and pleasure?

685
00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:50.237
- Yeah.

686
00:52:50.271 --> 00:52:52.974
How much pain you wanna
inflict on that fucker.

687
00:52:53.773 --> 00:52:56.143
and how much pleasure
you want to derive

688
00:52:56.177 --> 00:52:57.777
from inflicting said pain.

689
00:53:00.915 --> 00:53:02.984
Yeah. be my motherfucking guest.

690
00:53:05.286 --> 00:53:06.954
That's a Glock Nine.

691
00:53:06.988 --> 00:53:08.755
You can tell by the sound.

692
00:53:08.788 --> 00:53:11.558
That's one of the most reliable
stingers on the street.

693
00:53:11.591 --> 00:53:13.894
Most cops carry that exact
same model right there.

694
00:53:13.928 --> 00:53:15.172
That gun's so reliable
you could drop

695
00:53:15.196 --> 00:53:16.964
that in a pan of pancake batter.

696
00:53:16.998 --> 00:53:18.933
lift it up. it'll
still bang bang.

697
00:53:19.799 --> 00:53:22.003
Not that I would
recommend doing that.

698
00:53:25.272 --> 00:53:27.942
Yeah. you look like you
know what you're doing.

699
00:53:27.975 --> 00:53:29.977
Cop. cop. you ain't a cop.

700
00:53:30.011 --> 00:53:31.812
You a cop?

701
00:53:31.846 --> 00:53:34.015
- No. served. long time ago.

702
00:53:35.983 --> 00:53:36.984
- You kill anybody?

703
00:53:37.985 --> 00:53:38.953
- I was a marine.

704
00:53:38.986 --> 00:53:39.986
- So you killed people.

705
00:53:41.989 --> 00:53:45.960
I know. shit. you ain't
fucking around. huh?

706
00:53:45.993 --> 00:53:48.295
- No. sir. I am
not fucking around.

707
00:53:49.796 --> 00:53:52.967
- Willy. you can call me Dante.

708
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.970
- Okay. Dante. I
would like to purchase

709
00:53:56.003 --> 00:53:57.972
all of your guns and munitions.

710
00:53:58.005 --> 00:53:59.306
How much would that cost?

711
00:54:00.041 --> 00:54:02.742
- Yeah. you're
gonna need 'em. man.

712
00:54:02.776 --> 00:54:05.813
going up against
the Fetter gang.

713
00:54:05.846 --> 00:54:08.115
Yeah. they some bad apples. man.

714
00:54:08.149 --> 00:54:12.619
So many guns. they
have many guns.

715
00:54:13.988 --> 00:54:15.856
All right. I'm
gonna hook you up.

716
00:54:15.890 --> 00:54:16.857
What's that saying?

717
00:54:16.891 --> 00:54:18.826
The enemy of my enemy
is my friend's enemy.

718
00:54:18.859 --> 00:54:20.127
or some shit like that.

719
00:54:20.161 --> 00:54:21.961
All right. give me 10
grand for the whole lot.

720
00:54:26.834 --> 00:54:27.968
- There's 10 right there.

00:54:28.002 --> 00:54:30.237
Wait a second.

for more money. man.

00:54:43.017 --> 00:54:45.618
Man. anything else I
can get you. rich boy?

726
00:54:45.652 --> 00:54:48.055
- Nope. not unless
you can get me a car.

727
00:54:48.089 --> 00:54:50.858
- Let me guess. you
want one of them

728
00:54:50.891 --> 00:54:52.102
cars with no name on it. right?

729
00:54:52.126 --> 00:54:53.793
You wanna keep it clean.

730
00:54:53.828 --> 00:54:55.229
- That would be preferable.

731
00:54:55.262 --> 00:54:56.230
Shit. man. I got you covered.

732
00:54:56.263 --> 00:54:58.966
You want a sandwich with
that. too?

733
00:54:58.999 --> 00:55:00.359
- How about the
car and the jacket.

734
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:05.306
- Man. I love that jacket. man.

Oh. I need an ambulance.

You fucking shot me twice!

815
01:01:59.353 --> 01:02:00.630
- I need you to
tell me where he is.

816
01:02:00.654 --> 01:02:02.089
- Fuck you. I need an ambulance!

817

you'll call an ambulance?

I won't die like this.

- Yes. Zachary. I can do that.

823
01:02:22.543 --> 01:02:23.710
- You promise?

824
01:02:27.882 --> 01:02:28.816
He's probably at the club.

825
01:02:28.850 --> 01:02:30.117
He's always fucking there.

826
01:02:31.351 --> 01:02:32.386
- Club?

827
01:02:32.419 --> 01:02:34.822

their club. man!

Please. you don't
have to do this.

01:03:01.148 --> 01:03:02.850
You don't. please.

839

I have a daughter.

840
01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:11.124
Fuck.

01:03:11.158 --> 01:03:12.225
Thank you.

- Open or closed?

843
01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:23.870
- What?

844
01:03:25.272 --> 01:03:26.306
- Your casket.

845
01:03:27.875 --> 01:03:30.177
You want it open or closed?

846
01:04:28.769 --> 01:04:30.905
- Another one of Fetter's boys.

847
01:04:30.938 --> 01:04:32.205
- Yep.

848
01:04:34.708 --> 01:04:35.776
- Pardon me.

849
01:04:44.584 --> 01:04:45.987
Detective Neil Chen.

850
01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:47.421
Are you Donald Fetter?

851
01:04:49.991 --> 01:04:51.458
- What are you here for?

852
01:04:51.491 --> 01:04:53.493
- It seems your son
Rory and his friends

853
01:04:53.527 --> 01:04:54.938
are in the middle
of a little conflict

854
01:04:54.962 --> 01:04:57.631
with a gentleman by the
name of William Duncan.

855
01:05:01.568 --> 01:05:02.904
- I know all about William.

856
01:05:03.905 --> 01:05:05.305
He killed my son.

857
01:05:06.974 --> 01:05:08.742
I thought he died.

858
01:05:08.775 --> 01:05:10.878
- No. he's very much alive.

859
01:05:10.912 --> 01:05:13.915
I think he just killed another
one of your son's friends.

860
01:05:15.515 --> 01:05:16.316
I'll be blunt.

861
01:05:16.349 --> 01:05:17.819
I'm here on a
mission of goodwill

862
01:05:17.852 --> 01:05:20.420
to end this war. both sides.

863
01:05:20.454 --> 01:05:21.688
I just want it to stop.

864
01:05:22.489 --> 01:05:27.461
- Whatever my son has
done. that's his business.

865
01:05:27.494 --> 01:05:29.496
I'm not sure I can help.

866
01:05:30.164 --> 01:05:30.965
You can see yourself out.

867
01:05:30.998 --> 01:05:34.234
- Sir. I need to
speak with your son.

868
01:05:37.004 --> 01:05:38.371
I'm not here to arrest him.

869
01:05:38.405 --> 01:05:40.674
If I were. I wouldn't
be here alone.

870
01:05:40.707 --> 01:05:41.876
- Why should I trust you?

871
01:05:41.909 --> 01:05:43.310
- I know who you are. Donnie.

872
01:05:43.343 --> 01:05:44.879
I know all about you.

873
01:05:44.912 --> 01:05:45.913
Every cop does.

874
01:05:48.015 --> 01:05:52.920
And I know that we allow
you to do what you do.

875
01:05:53.855 --> 01:05:55.455
and I know that that can change.

876
01:05:56.523 --> 01:05:57.859
Do you want that to change?

877
01:06:07.434 --> 01:06:08.735
- Get your ass in here.

878
01:06:08.769 --> 01:06:09.871
Sure.

879
01:06:11.772 --> 01:06:12.773
- He'll be right in.

880
01:06:24.451 --> 01:06:26.686
- Who the fuck is this guy?

881
01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:28.823
Rory Fetter. Detective Chen.

882
01:06:31.358 --> 01:06:32.359
- The fuck do you want?

883
01:06:32.392 --> 01:06:34.427
- I know all about your
war with William Duncan.

884
01:06:34.461 --> 01:06:35.461
- My war?

885
01:06:36.898 --> 01:06:40.835
If I read the papers correctly.
William Duncan is deceased.

886
01:06:40.868 --> 01:06:43.737
- Oh. no. he's not.

887
01:06:43.770 --> 01:06:45.772
In fact. he just
killed your buddy Zach.

888
01:06:48.075 --> 01:06:49.877
- Zach's dead?
- Yeah.

889
01:06:50.644 --> 01:06:53.413
Shot three times today.
just now. in fact.

890
01:06:53.446 --> 01:06:54.347
- Then why are you here?

891
01:06:54.381 --> 01:06:57.450
Why aren't you out
chasing this murderer?

892
01:06:57.484 --> 01:06:58.552
- Don't know where he is.

893
01:06:58.585 --> 01:06:59.954
He escaped the hospital.

894
01:06:59.987 --> 01:07:03.356
The one that you sent
him to when you shot him.

895
01:07:03.390 --> 01:07:04.859
murdered his wife.

896
01:07:04.892 --> 01:07:05.893
- Allegedly.

897
01:07:07.995 --> 01:07:10.865
So. you felt that
it was a good idea

898
01:07:10.898 --> 01:07:14.869
to come to our place of business

899
01:07:14.902 --> 01:07:17.972
and tell us that this fuck-face

900
01:07:18.005 --> 01:07:20.674
who killed one of my
friends is on the loose

901
01:07:20.707 --> 01:07:21.843
and you can't catch him?

902
01:07:21.876 --> 01:07:24.846
- Listen. I'm actually here
on a mission of goodwill.

903
01:07:24.879 --> 01:07:26.646
'cause I want this all to end.

904
01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:27.849
He's not gonna stop.

905
01:07:27.882 --> 01:07:29.482
So I'm here to tell
you that maybe you

906
01:07:29.516 --> 01:07:30.885
should disappear for a while.

907
01:07:35.488 --> 01:07:36.488
- Is that all?

908
01:07:38.893 --> 01:07:41.028
- Yeah. that's all.

909
01:07:44.098 --> 01:07:45.098
- Enjoy your day.

910
01:07:51.806 --> 01:07:52.439
The fuck is this?

911
01:07:52.472 --> 01:07:53.908
This guy trying to scare us?

912
01:07:56.143 --> 01:07:58.045
- I want you to kill that prick.

913
01:08:02.049 --> 01:08:03.683
Get it over with.

914
01:08:03.717 --> 01:08:04.852
Go.

915
01:08:06.486 --> 01:08:07.754
- Right.

916
01:08:08.923 --> 01:08:10.757
'Cause I fucking do everything.

917
01:08:10.790 --> 01:08:12.159
Right. yeah.

918
01:08:56.170 --> 01:08:57.604
- Evening. Detective.

919
01:08:59.941 --> 01:09:01.675
Gun wasn't cheap.

920
01:09:02.642 --> 01:09:03.844
- You're telling me.

921
01:09:15.923 --> 01:09:18.059
- What the hell
are you doing here?

922
01:09:18.092 --> 01:09:20.027
- You working for them?

923
01:09:20.061 --> 01:09:21.494
What?

924
01:09:21.528 --> 01:09:22.595
You a crooked cop?

925
01:09:23.496 --> 01:09:25.799
- No. man. I'm trying
to fucking help you.

926
01:09:26.867 --> 01:09:29.769
I want this to stop. I
want all of this to stop.

927
01:09:29.803 --> 01:09:32.772
- I saw you at the club.

928
01:09:32.807 --> 01:09:34.809
- I went to tell
them about Zach.

929
01:09:35.475 --> 01:09:37.211
They deserve to
know what happened.

930
01:09:39.646 --> 01:09:41.781
How far are you gonna take this?

931
01:09:41.816 --> 01:09:43.550
- However far it goes. it goes.

932
01:09:44.218 --> 01:09:46.753
They took everything from me.

933
01:09:46.786 --> 01:09:47.898
and it's only a matter of time

934
01:09:47.922 --> 01:09:49.622
before they do it
to somebody else.

935
01:09:49.656 --> 01:09:51.158
- You gotta let this go.

936
01:09:55.762 --> 01:09:56.762
- Yeah.

937
01:09:57.932 --> 01:09:59.910
You know what. I didn't
think of that. you're right.

938
01:09:59.934 --> 01:10:01.135
I should fucking let it go.

939
01:10:02.103 --> 01:10:05.239
Are you even fucking listening
to anything I'm saying?

940
01:10:08.641 --> 01:10:09.641
Let it go?

941
01:10:10.277 --> 01:10:11.912
You know what these people do!

942
01:10:15.715 --> 01:10:18.152
- I know.
- Yeah. you know.

943
01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:21.055
- In fact. there have been
other initiation murders

944
01:10:21.088 --> 01:10:24.058
just like this. and
I knew it was them.

945
01:10:24.091 --> 01:10:26.861
but nothing ever fucking
sticks with these guys.

946
01:10:31.664 --> 01:10:33.134
- Well. well done. Barney Fife.

947
01:10:34.068 --> 01:10:38.139
Doing such a great job of
protecting my community!

948
01:10:41.942 --> 01:10:43.944
- I cannot let you
keep going like this.

949
01:10:45.146 --> 01:10:46.180
You know that.

950
01:10:46.213 --> 01:10:47.213
- I'll stop.

951
01:10:49.984 --> 01:10:51.318
It'll all be over very soon.

952
01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:54.597
But I'm telling you now.
if you get in my way.

953
01:10:54.621 --> 01:10:55.890
I will fucking kill you.

954
01:10:57.091 --> 01:10:58.091
You understand me?

955
01:10:59.692 --> 01:11:00.794
- Yeah. I understand.

956
01:11:03.831 --> 01:11:04.932
- Good.

957
01:11:04.965 --> 01:11:07.935
Now I don't wanna see you
again until this is over.

958
01:11:08.735 --> 01:11:10.703
Then I'll turn myself
in. I'll go to jail.

959
01:11:10.737 --> 01:11:11.915
You can give me the
lethal injection.

960
01:11:11.939 --> 01:11:13.007
I don't fucking care.

961
01:11:14.408 --> 01:11:18.012
But right now. you
need to do one thing.

962
01:11:18.045 --> 01:11:19.180
You look the other way.

963
01:11:27.988 --> 01:11:28.988
- All right.

964
01:11:31.892 --> 01:11:33.227
Go and get this over with.

965
01:11:34.895 --> 01:11:35.996
Quick.

966
01:11:57.852 --> 01:11:58.852
- Get in here.

967
01:12:02.923 --> 01:12:03.923
Sit down.

968
01:12:07.228 --> 01:12:08.795
Why are you still here?

969
01:12:10.931 --> 01:12:11.698
- What?

970
01:12:11.731 --> 01:12:12.500
You just asked me
to come in here.

971
01:12:12.533 --> 01:12:15.269
- Go take care of
William Duncan.

972
01:12:15.302 --> 01:12:16.871
- Don't worry about it.

973
01:12:16.904 --> 01:12:17.872
I'll take care of him.

974
01:12:17.905 --> 01:12:19.106
- Just kill him.

975
01:12:20.107 --> 01:12:21.876
What the fuck's wrong with you?

976
01:12:21.909 --> 01:12:22.910
He's one man.

977
01:12:23.911 --> 01:12:25.045
- I'll take care of it.

978
01:12:28.249 --> 01:12:29.350
- Just fucking bounce.

979
01:12:32.253 --> 01:12:33.253
Kill the prick.

980
01:12:34.922 --> 01:12:38.658
You're my son. goddamn
it. act like it for once.

981
01:12:41.761 --> 01:12:42.761
- I'm your son.

982
01:12:45.966 --> 01:12:47.434
- Pussy.

983
01:13:10.958 --> 01:13:12.759
- Hey. my brother!

984
01:13:12.792 --> 01:13:14.895
You gotta let me in there!

985
01:13:14.929 --> 01:13:16.363
My girl is in there!

986
01:13:16.397 --> 01:13:17.998
Hell. all my girls.

987
01:13:18.032 --> 01:13:19.766
I'm VIP!

988
01:13:19.799 --> 01:13:20.935
Oh. let me in. man.

989
01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:00.940
- Shit.

990
01:14:08.949 --> 01:14:09.950
You got me.

991
01:14:11.819 --> 01:14:13.020
- Looks that way.

992
01:14:16.090 --> 01:14:17.858
- Get it over with.

993
01:14:24.198 --> 01:14:26.200
- I don't feel anything.

994
01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:34.942
I'm serious. Donnie.

995
01:14:37.211 --> 01:14:38.211
Nothing.

996
01:14:41.048 --> 01:14:43.350
You know. they say the
first time is the hardest.

997
01:14:46.287 --> 01:14:49.857
When I killed your son
Danny. I was emotional.

998
01:14:53.394 --> 01:14:54.828
It felt...

999
01:14:56.964 --> 01:14:59.799
I think the word is visceral.

1000
01:15:02.236 --> 01:15:03.904
Cathartic.

1001
01:15:03.937 --> 01:15:04.937
- Yes.

1002
01:15:05.472 --> 01:15:08.108
- But now I'm sitting
here in front of you.

1003
01:15:10.577 --> 01:15:11.577
Nothing.

1004
01:15:15.949 --> 01:15:17.418
Not even a shake.

1005
01:15:17.451 --> 01:15:18.485
Is this what happens?

1006
01:15:19.953 --> 01:15:20.954
Is this normal?

1007
01:15:22.256 --> 01:15:23.256
You tell me.

1008
01:15:25.959 --> 01:15:27.561
How many people you killed?

1009
01:15:27.594 --> 01:15:29.897
Hmm. do you remember?

1010
01:15:32.666 --> 01:15:34.935
How'd it feel when
you killed my wife?

1011
01:15:34.968 --> 01:15:36.937
- Enough of this shit.

1012
01:15:36.970 --> 01:15:37.971
- You feel numb then?

1013
01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:44.411
'Cause I feel numb at the
prospect of killing you.

1014
01:15:50.951 --> 01:15:54.221
You know. I feel a
little disappointed.

1015
01:15:56.223 --> 01:15:57.925
- Just kill me.

1016
01:16:05.966 --> 01:16:07.334
- Hell no!
- Shit. man!

1017
01:16:07.368 --> 01:16:08.635
Go. go. go. go. go!

1018
01:16:08.669 --> 01:16:09.669
Go. go!

1019
01:16:16.977 --> 01:16:17.977
- Nothing.

1020
01:16:53.714 --> 01:16:55.215
- Hey.

1021
01:16:55.249 --> 01:16:56.316
Hello. Rory.

1022
01:16:58.185 --> 01:16:59.720
- Who's this?

1023
01:16:59.753 --> 01:17:00.753
- Who do you think?

1024
01:17:06.026 --> 01:17:07.628
- Did you kill him?

1025
01:17:08.762 --> 01:17:09.762
- Yep.

1026
01:17:11.765 --> 01:17:14.234
- Well. then I'm talking
to a fucking dead man.

1027
01:17:14.268 --> 01:17:15.708
- You can't kill
what's already dead.

1028
01:17:25.245 --> 01:17:26.246
- Change of plans.

1029
01:17:28.449 --> 01:17:29.516
Get back to the club.

1030
01:17:31.752 --> 01:17:32.752
- My man.

1031
01:18:10.190 --> 01:18:11.190
- Oh. fuck!

1032
01:18:32.847 --> 01:18:33.847
- Sorry. brother.

1033
01:18:35.850 --> 01:18:37.284
- What are you sorry for?

1034
01:18:40.787 --> 01:18:45.792
He was a shit father and
a despicable human being.

1035
01:18:49.796 --> 01:18:51.131
But that's not the point.

1036
01:18:52.766 --> 01:18:53.367
You can't kill

1037
01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:55.569
what's already dead. Rory.

1038
01:19:09.884 --> 01:19:11.285
- Find him!

1039
01:19:11.318 --> 01:19:14.087
Yeah. let's roll. let's roll.

1041
01:19:37.812 --> 01:19:41.548

Get off me!

1046
01:20:19.252 --> 01:20:20.754
I'm walking out with him. Rory!

1047
01:20:20.787 --> 01:20:23.724
- The fuck off me. motherfucker!

1048
01:20:23.757 --> 01:20:24.791
You're fucking dead.

1049
01:20:29.396 --> 01:20:30.797
- I'll fucking kill him!

1050
01:20:32.633 --> 01:20:33.633
- So will I.

1051
01:21:58.585 --> 01:22:00.955
- Rory. I saw that guy again.

1052
01:22:07.527 --> 01:22:09.296
Yo. it's me.

1053
01:22:09.329 --> 01:22:10.329
- Come in!

1054
01:22:13.835 --> 01:22:15.635
- You got shot.

1055
01:22:15.669 --> 01:22:16.669
- No shit.

1056
01:22:17.939 --> 01:22:19.306
Where'd they get ya?

1057
01:22:19.339 --> 01:22:21.541
- Shoulder. I can't reach it.

1058
01:22:21.575 --> 01:22:23.978
- Wow. little bit
of a problem. huh?

1059
01:22:24.011 --> 01:22:25.555
Yeah. when you get shot
in the back like that.

1060
01:22:25.579 --> 01:22:26.824
like. hell. what
are you gonna do?

1061
01:22:26.848 --> 01:22:28.582
Come on. stand up.

1062
01:22:29.449 --> 01:22:30.818
Okay. sorry.

1063
01:22:30.852 --> 01:22:32.552
Can I take a look?

1064
01:22:33.988 --> 01:22:34.822
Oh. man.

1065
01:22:34.856 --> 01:22:36.523
Man. that's in there deep.

1066
01:22:37.859 --> 01:22:41.896
- You think you can
get it out with these?

1067
01:22:41.929 --> 01:22:43.363
- I ain't no doctor. man.

1068
01:22:43.396 --> 01:22:44.798
I don't care. just try.

1069
01:22:44.832 --> 01:22:45.832
Just do it.

1070
01:23:27.008 --> 01:23:27.809
- Anything?

1071
01:23:27.842 --> 01:23:29.543
It's empty.

1072
01:23:40.922 --> 01:23:43.557
- That's the best I can do
under the circumstances.

1073
01:23:54.168 --> 01:23:55.937
- How are you today. sir?

1074
01:23:55.970 --> 01:23:59.372
Do you by any chance know who
owns that brown car out there?

1075
01:24:00.975 --> 01:24:03.677
- What is the license plate?

1076
01:24:06.546 --> 01:24:09.416
- 4-4-0-6-2.

1077
01:24:13.855 --> 01:24:17.624
- I don't know. it's
not in the system.

1078
01:24:17.657 --> 01:24:18.658
- That's okay.

1079
01:24:18.692 --> 01:24:21.695
Thank you.

1080
01:24:21.728 --> 01:24:22.864
- Yo. what the fuck. man?

1081
01:24:24.764 --> 01:24:25.764

01:24:36.878 --> 01:24:37.879
- Look at that shit.

1083
01:24:39.947 --> 01:24:40.947
Can I keep this?

1084
01:24:51.691 --> 01:24:53.727

01:24:57.098 --> 01:25:00.835
Oh. Willy. Willy boy!

1086
01:25:00.868 --> 01:25:01.869
- Who the fuck is that?

1087
01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:03.871
- It's them.

1088
01:25:04.872 --> 01:25:05.973
They must've followed me.

1089
01:25:07.875 --> 01:25:09.076

- Better not try to shoot
out my tires or some shit.

1110

You know how much

You killed my father. Willy.

01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:54.315
But Danny...

I fucking loved him.

1183
01:32:06.927 --> 01:32:11.098
He wasn't made for this
world like you and I.

1184
01:32:11.131 --> 01:32:12.131
No. no.

Wanna go get a drink?

1200

- Can't have you die on me.

1201
01:34:42.716 --> 01:34:44.151
You caused a lot of damage.

1202
01:34:49.723 --> 01:34:54.728
You better arrest me.

1203
01:35:05.506 --> 01:35:07.274
