00:15:55.205 --> 00:15:57.123
Does anyone speak Spanish?

5
00:18:24.813 --> 00:18:27.440
{\an8}They promised me they were going to start fixing things.

00:18:27.482 --> 00:18:29.901
You don't treat people like that.
You don't treat people like garbage.

7
00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:57.303
Idiot doesn't know that you can't evict children
because children don’t pay rent.

8
00:18:57.512 --> 00:18:59.472
You evict the parents!

9
00:19:01.224 --> 00:19:03.226
I've got to resecure that number seven.

10
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.856
Just have to board them.

11
00:21:24.826 --> 00:21:26.619
That's the car that she was in.

12
00:21:29.163 --> 00:21:30.498
She's not going to pick up.

13
00:21:38.423 --> 00:21:40.425
It ain’t lunchtime.

14
00:22:10.079 --> 00:22:11.831

Don't get me wrong. they want it.

18
00:58:13.699 --> 00:58:16.577
I know I'm falling short as a mother...

19
00:58:16.619 --> 00:58:19.496
in every way.

20
00:58:21.415 --> 00:58:23.042
But I'm doing my best and

21
00:58:23.083 --> 00:58:27.838
maybe what I'm doing my kids will
understand when they're older.

22
00:58:29.465 --> 00:58:31.759
and hopefully they'll be okay

23
00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:35.471
because they're supported by their community.

24
01:13:04.839 --> 01:13:05.924

Jeff: If he chooses not to enter the military
then he has that option.

27
01:16:35.008 --> 01:16:36.926
Jeff: So let's not keep hitting it on the head.

28
01:27:16.023 --> 01:27:19.401
They need to have a union because
they are too disgusting.

29
01:33:17.092 --> 01:33:18.760
