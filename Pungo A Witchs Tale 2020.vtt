00:27:32.088 --> 00:27:33.707
Sam. give me a hand!

384
00:27:33.976 --> 00:27:35.653
Grace. get under the table!

385
00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.840
Hold on!

386
00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.578
Is everyone okay?

387
00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.328
I don't know.

388
00:28:29.134 --> 00:28:30.678
I'm still breathing.

389
00:28:31.081 --> 00:28:32.831
I think.

390
00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.344
Grace?

391
00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.497
I think you may have gotten really lucky.

392
00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.574
Still no cell service?

393
00:29:31.574 --> 00:29:32.338
Sam?

394
00:29:33.882 --> 00:29:35.082
No.

395
00:29:35.686 --> 00:29:37.537
Do you have a landline?

396
00:29:38.276 --> 00:29:40.915
Who still has a landline?

397
00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.574
I say we head into town.

398
00:29:59.574 --> 00:30:01.407
Tell the sheriff about 
your friend.

399
00:30:01.407 --> 00:30:02.491
Get some help.

400
00:30:03.766 --> 00:30:05.920
I can't believe all this is happening.

401
00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.167
Yeah.

402
00:30:07.167 --> 00:30:08.451
Weird.

403
00:30:09.257 --> 00:30:13.113
My fire company 
must be going ape shit with all the calls.

404
00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:44.334
I'm sorry. is it just me. but was 
there a farm over there?

405
00:30:44.334 --> 00:30:46.288
Somewhere?

406
00:30:46.288 --> 00:30:48.125
[Tires squeal]

407
00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.948
Shouldn't we be seeing the paper mill?

408
00:30:57.948 --> 00:31:00.712
I mean like down there?

409
00:31:00.712 --> 00:31:02.709
Through there?

410
00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:04.283
Somewhere?

411
00:31:04.686 --> 00:31:06.280
What the hell?

412
00:31:06.683 --> 00:31:09.259
Did you take a different road?

413
00:31:18.926 --> 00:31:19.958
Come on

414
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.075
Okay.

415
00:31:55.746 --> 00:31:57.710
Okay. okay. it's official. I'm 
freaking out.

416
00:31:57.710 --> 00:31:59.504
Where's the effing road?!

417
00:32:04.292 --> 00:32:07.233
Not even the emergency broadcast signal?

418
00:32:17.229 --> 00:32:17.859
Ouch!

419
00:32:17.859 --> 00:32:18.912
You're awake. right?

420
00:32:18.912 --> 00:32:19.834
What?

421
00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:22.244
Me too.

422
00:32:22.781 --> 00:32:24.013
That's so juvenile.

423
00:32:24.886 --> 00:32:26.327
Seriously?

424
00:32:26.797 --> 00:32:28.646
Let's try the other direction.

425
00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.909
Hey. I just saw someone in the woods.

426
00:32:43.245 --> 00:32:44.056
Fine.

427
00:32:45.869 --> 00:32:47.938
[Tire skid]

428
00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.034
This makes no sense.

429
00:32:50.504 --> 00:32:51.914
Look up there. see them?

430
00:32:52.518 --> 00:32:53.490
More guys.

431
00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:05.341
Bud?

432
00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.948
Hey!

433
00:33:11.888 --> 00:33:14.014
Come on down. we want to talk to you.

434
00:33:14.685 --> 00:33:16.625
That was some storm. huh?

435
00:33:18.875 --> 00:33:21.241
You know what's happening?

436
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:32.914
Whoa.

437
00:33:39.167 --> 00:33:40.529
Hey. Bud?

438
00:33:41.133 --> 00:33:42.493
Don't go up there. man.

439
00:33:42.493 --> 00:33:45.037
Bud. listen this doesn't
seem like a good idea right now.

440
00:33:45.037 --> 00:33:46.537
Something is really really off.

441
00:33:48.819 --> 00:33:51.663
Bud. let's go back to the house. okay. please?

442
00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:52.913
Yeah.

443
00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.159
Everybody else is seeing this. right?

444
00:34:02.709 --> 00:34:03.614
Yeah.

445
00:34:04.125 --> 00:34:04.783
Okay.

446
00:34:05.253 --> 00:34:07.229
Okay. back to this truck.

447
00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:09.453
Back to the house.

448
00:34:10.542 --> 00:34:11.864
Lions and tigers and bears.

449
00:34:11.864 --> 00:34:12.621
Oh my.

450
00:34:12.625 --> 00:34:14.827
It is the one she seeks!

451

[War cries]

452
00:34:16.959 --> 00:34:17.957
Oh shit!

453
00:34:17.957 --> 00:34:19.169
Back to the truck!

454
00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:41.731

455
00:35:10.711 --> 00:35:11.387
[Gunshot]

456
00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.954
This is crazy.

457

[Distant howling]

458
00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.375
Back inside.

459
00:35:49.852 --> 00:35:52.537
[Howling]

460
00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.194
You have any weapons in the house?

461
00:36:10.194 --> 00:36:11.437
Yeah.

462
00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.364
You know how to use that?

463
00:36:22.035 --> 00:36:23.264
What else you got?

464
00:36:23.936 --> 00:36:25.505
Anything else?

465
00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.994
Is this thing real?

466
00:36:35.994 --> 00:36:37.038
Yeah.

467
00:36:37.038 --> 00:36:38.452
But you need shot.

468
00:36:38.452 --> 00:36:40.156
And gunpowder.

469
00:36:40.156 --> 00:36:41.917
You mean this?

470
00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.120
Really?

471
00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:49.654
I get the blunderbuss?

472
00:36:49.654 --> 00:36:52.766
Blunderbuss. see you're the expert?

473
00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.286
Is it stale?

474
00:37:01.226 --> 00:37:02.550
How would I know?

475
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:05.290
Well. anyway.
it's got that choppy thingy.

476
00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:14.209
I've got a real fire axe.

477
00:38:24.704 --> 00:38:26.604
Of course.

478
00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:53.250
Found the charcoal.

479
00:38:54.542 --> 00:38:55.754
And these might be useful.

480
00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:08.406
There's no water.

481
00:39:08.406 --> 00:39:09.863
No shit.

482
00:39:19.664 --> 00:39:20.880
One problem solved.

483
00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.739
No other buildings.

484
00:39:26.739 --> 00:39:28.962
No telephone poles.

485
00:39:28.962 --> 00:39:30.446
No electrical towers.

486
00:39:30.446 --> 00:39:31.949
No roads.

487
00:39:32.889 --> 00:39:35.340
Not an airplane in the sky.

488
00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:38.640
How could it all have vanished?

489
00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.739
Hey.

490
00:39:42.739 --> 00:39:44.154
Smoke.

491
00:39:44.154 --> 00:39:45.698
See it.

492
00:39:45.698 --> 00:39:47.002
Over there?

493
00:39:48.459 --> 00:39:50.074
Could be from a 
lightning strike?

494
00:39:50.611 --> 00:39:51.784
Or a campfire?

495
00:39:51.784 --> 00:39:53.257
With more crazies.

496
00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:55.577
Zombie apocalypse.

497
00:39:56.517 --> 00:39:58.032
We should check it out.

498
00:39:59.039 --> 00:40:00.320
It'd have to be on foot.

499
00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:02.363
Agreed.

500
00:40:02.363 --> 00:40:04.300
We'll set out in the morning.

501
00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:08.632
So anyone else hungry?

502
00:40:32.959 --> 00:40:33.623
[Bang]

503
00:40:33.623 --> 00:40:34.197
Shit!

504
00:40:34.935 --> 00:40:35.713
What?!

505
00:40:35.713 --> 00:40:36.786
Where?!

506
00:40:36.786 --> 00:40:38.538
What did you see?!

507
00:40:38.538 --> 00:40:40.337
Sorry.

508
00:40:40.337 --> 00:40:43.406
I just wanted to see if it actually worked.

509
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.394
It does.

510
00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.329
No wonder they fired him from the fire crew.

511
00:40:50.329 --> 00:40:51.663
Oh come on.

512
00:40:51.663 --> 00:40:54.320
Sorry I've never loaded a blunderbuss before.

513
00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.840
How expert are you at flintlock's. Bud?

514
00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:02.887
Don't look at me like that.  

515
00:41:02.887 --> 00:41:06.824
Well at least they didn't blow off your 
hands so congratulations.

516
00:41:06.824 --> 00:41:07.920
That's what I'm saying.

517
00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:15.120
So how do you transport a whole house?

518
00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.380
Maybe we didn't move.

519
00:41:21.084 --> 00:41:23.504
At least we didn't move in space.

520
00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.203
But rather

521
00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:29.054
perhaps we moved in time.

522
00:41:29.658 --> 00:41:31.195
Time?

523
00:41:31.933 --> 00:41:33.374
Though that freak storm?

524
00:41:33.978 --> 00:41:36.000
Explain that Astro girl?

525
00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:40.458
Astro psychological.

526
00:41:41.062 --> 00:41:42.417
Astrophysicist.

527
00:41:42.417 --> 00:41:44.284
I know. I'm just jerking her chain.

528
00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.603
Spooky entanglement.

529
00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:52.459
That's a real thing?

530
00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:57.680
The phrase was credited to Albert Einstein.

531
00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:01.154
Wait a minute.

532
00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:02.908
Didn't I see you on TV?

533
00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:05.917
Discovery channel.

534
00:42:05.917 --> 00:42:06.758
Yes.

535
00:42:06.758 --> 00:42:07.492
About UFOs?

536
00:42:07.492 --> 00:42:08.285
No.

537
00:42:08.285 --> 00:42:09.949
With that bozo-haired guy?

538
00:42:09.949 --> 00:42:11.280
What a piece of work.

539
00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.238
All right.

540
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.073
the theory goes something like this.

541
00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:19.476
Black holes come in all sizes.

542
00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:22.454
There's one at the center of our galaxy.

543
00:42:22.454 --> 00:42:24.328
It's immense.

544
00:42:24.328 --> 00:42:27.282
A monster that swallows space and time

545
00:42:27.282 --> 00:42:29.836
and keeps the milky way from flying apart.

546
00:42:29.836 --> 00:42:33.910
But there are also micro black holes.

547
00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:39.403
Singularities smaller than a speck of dust.

548
00:42:39.403 --> 00:42:44.597
Capable of distorting 
space-time.

549
00:42:44.597 --> 00:42:48.531
If one orbited our solar system and passed through the earth.

550
00:42:48.531 --> 00:42:49.955
it could bend time.

551
00:42:49.955 --> 00:42:53.040
It could open a gate to a parallel dimension.

552
00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:55.988
Dr. Sheridan.

553
00:42:55.988 --> 00:42:59.552
open a gateway to where?

554
00:42:59.552 --> 00:43:00.706
The past.

555
00:43:00.706 --> 00:43:01.710
The future.

556
00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:05.430
Time doesn't need to be linear.

557
00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.153
We just experience it that way.

558
00:43:08.153 --> 00:43:09.287
A gate?

559
00:43:09.287 --> 00:43:10.820
One way?

560
00:43:11.167 --> 00:43:13.450
Not necessarily one way.

561
00:43:14.054 --> 00:43:15.918
Come on. I'll show you.

562
00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:24.005
See.

563
00:43:24.005 --> 00:43:28.129
I think that's one of two micro singularities.

564
00:43:28.129 --> 00:43:31.573
The storm is just an atmospheric by-product.

565
00:43:31.573 --> 00:43:32.907
That one is moving off.

566
00:43:32.907 --> 00:43:34.711
And there

567
00:43:35.852 --> 00:43:37.446
that's its binary companion.

568
00:43:37.446 --> 00:43:39.840
a second singularity moving in.

569
00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:40.994
So...

570
00:43:40.994 --> 00:43:42.455
what?

571
00:43:42.455 --> 00:43:44.119
We wait for that thing to hit us?

572
00:43:44.723 --> 00:43:47.272
Try to ride it back to our time?

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:39.998
So she was the witch.

She healed sick people with herbs.

And they drowned her for it.

597
00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:06.371
The governor of Virginia gave her a pardon just recently.

598
00:45:07.042 --> 00:45:08.195

01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:13.154
Synchronization and all.

1140
01:38:13.154 --> 01:38:18.073
Well. she thought she was magical.

1141
01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:20.920
Wasn't she though?

1142
01:38:21.457 --> 01:38:23.826
You don't believe that?

01:38:23.826 --> 01:38:25.960
I don't know.

1144
01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:28.313

1149
01:38:40.491 --> 01:38:42.507
I guess so.

1150
01:38:45.084 --> 01:38:47.867
Well. goodbye then.

1151
01:38:47.867 --> 01:38:50.038
I'll mail you the final payment.

1152
01:38:50.776 --> 01:38:53.118
Okay. sure.

1153
01:38:53.118 --> 01:38:54.951
Thanks for the work.

1154
01:38:54.951 --> 01:38:57.545
