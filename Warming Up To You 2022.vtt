- Good morning. Kate.
- Hey. Tom!

16
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:36.800
Ah. it's just me. everyone.

17
00:00:37.834 --> 00:00:39.500
Another busy day for ya.

18
00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:40.900
Hey.

19
00:00:41.033 --> 00:00:42.834
Uh. Kate?

20
00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:52.300
And here we are again.

21
00:00:52.433 --> 00:00:54.367
Here we are.

22
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.166
Look. Kate.

23
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.200
It's not as if I don't know
your track record.

24
00:00:58.333 --> 00:00:59.266
When I bought this business.

25
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.967
I was told
you were indispensable--

26
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.967
the most sought-after
personal trainer in L.A.

27
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.600
But it seems
you're still having difficulty

28
00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:10.433
with the new direction
we're taking.

29
00:01:10.567 --> 00:01:12.467
You did memorize our new motto.
didn't you?

30
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.200
"No sweat. no effort--
no problem."

31
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:16.900
Exactly. And guess what?

32
00:01:17.033 --> 00:01:18.400
Memberships are up.

33
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:21.467
with more and more celebrities
joining every day.

34
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.266
And that's why people
pay top dollar

35
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.967
for the finest fitness centers
in California--

36
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.800
to see.

37
00:01:27.934 --> 00:01:28.967
and be seen.

38
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.767
by famous people.
Not to--

39
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.066
Get fit?

40
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.200
'Cause we have surgeons
for that!

41
00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:34.300
Ahem.

42
00:01:34.433 --> 00:01:35.300
Great.

43
00:01:35.433 --> 00:01:36.633
I'm glad
we understand each other.

44
00:01:36.767 --> 00:01:37.967
Mm-hmm.

45
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.600
Now. if you can apologize
to Mrs. Stanford

46
00:01:39.734 --> 00:01:40.967
for suggesting sit-ups.

47
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.400
you can get
right back out there.

48
00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:44.400
But Nigel--

49
00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:45.533
With a smile.

50
00:01:46.767 --> 00:01:47.867
Although I would suggest

51
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.734
you might start trying
some tooth-whitening.

52
00:01:50.867 --> 00:01:52.734
It's just...

53
00:01:52.867 --> 00:01:54.233
yeah. just a little...

54
00:01:54.367 --> 00:01:56.266
Okay. Yeah.

55
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.467
Wow.

56
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.834
Okay if I make myself
an acai shake?

57
00:02:02.967 --> 00:02:04.500
Yeah. help yourself.
It's a little slow right now.

58
00:02:04.633 --> 00:02:07.500
so I'm just gonna restock
before the rush.

59
00:02:07.633 --> 00:02:08.734
What are those?

60
00:02:08.867 --> 00:02:12.066
Nigel thinks we should have
more of a selection.

61
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.400
Some of the clients
aren't very fond

62
00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:14.433
of the healthy shakes.

63
00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:17.166
So. beer and gin?

64
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.300
Infused with
butterfly pea flowers.

65
00:02:19.433 --> 00:02:20.934
Do you know how much sugar
is in those?

66
00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:22.934
I don't. but I'm sure you do.

67
00:02:23.066 --> 00:02:24.333
Uh. and if you're upset
about this.

68
00:02:24.467 --> 00:02:26.300
you're gonna be really upset
when you--

69
00:02:29.467 --> 00:02:31.200
Holy crow. is that...
that's Agent Darian Hall!

70
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.367
12:00.
he's coming right at us.

71
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.367
Are you sure?

72
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.667
I'm just kidding.

73
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.500
Well. he's got a beard
and he got a little fluffy.

74
00:02:39.633 --> 00:02:41.500
but that's him all right--
look at that.

75
00:02:41.633 --> 00:02:43.166
Huh.

76
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.300
You know. "Darian Hall"
is his character's name.

77
00:02:45.433 --> 00:02:46.467
by the way.

78
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.800
His real name is Rick Steele.
which. frankly.

79
00:02:48.934 --> 00:02:50.433
sounds made up. too.

80
00:02:50.567 --> 00:02:52.834
I will take... a shake.

81
00:02:52.967 --> 00:02:53.800
Uh. protein?

82
00:02:53.934 --> 00:02:54.834
Chocolate.

83
00:02:54.967 --> 00:02:56.700
Wait. We have
chocolate ice cream now?

84
00:02:56.834 --> 00:03:00.166
I think my favorite is
"Assault on the World Rising."

85
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.934
I mean. that ending! Wow.

86
00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:05.100
The way you just take down
that whole mercenary army is--

87
00:03:05.233 --> 00:03:08.033
That's probably
a stunt double. Matt.

88
00:03:08.166 --> 00:03:09.433
- Stunt double?
- Kate.

89
00:03:09.567 --> 00:03:10.433
I'm just saying

90
00:03:10.567 --> 00:03:12.934
those action scenes
are strenuous...

91
00:03:13.066 --> 00:03:14.934
especially for a guy

92
00:03:15.066 --> 00:03:17.567
who drinks
a chocolate milkshake at a gym.

93
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.600
You know you can burn
just as many calories in a--

94
00:03:19.734 --> 00:03:22.967
As much as I would enjoy
a celebrity mansplain.

95
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.600
I just need to tell you

96
00:03:24.734 --> 00:03:26.934
that I have a degree
in exercise fitness

97
00:03:27.066 --> 00:03:28.500
and a master's in nutrition.

98
00:03:28.633 --> 00:03:30.867
- Kate here is very smart.
- Mm.

99
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.333
But did you know
that Rick once--

100
00:03:32.467 --> 00:03:33.400
...Survived capture

101
00:03:33.533 --> 00:03:34.633
and fought my way
out of a Thai prison

102
00:03:34.767 --> 00:03:35.967
using nothing more than
a piece of string

103
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.033
and a plastic comb.

104
00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:38.834
Did you seriously just--

105
00:03:38.967 --> 00:03:41.066
He's been in some pretty
precarious situations!

106
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.200
...Just reference

107
00:03:43.333 --> 00:03:45.200
a fictitious character
in one of your movies?

108
00:03:45.333 --> 00:03:46.266
Yes.

109
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.900
Look. I'm sure that
you used to be fit.

110
00:03:49.033 --> 00:03:50.033
but I hate to break it to you.

111
00:03:50.166 --> 00:03:51.900
but. uh.
you're not. currently.

112
00:03:52.033 --> 00:03:54.934
And you know this how?

113
00:03:55.066 --> 00:03:56.233
Because it's what I do.

114
00:03:56.367 --> 00:03:57.700
Plain and simply put--

115
00:03:57.834 --> 00:03:59.700
you wouldn't survive
one of my workouts.

116
00:03:59.834 --> 00:04:02.100
Okay. I think
that's a bit of a stretch.

117
00:04:02.233 --> 00:04:03.800
Not that I need
to prove anything to you.

118
00:04:03.934 --> 00:04:07.400
but I guarantee I could
survive anything you dish out.

119
00:04:07.533 --> 00:04:09.367
- Oh. yeah?
- Yeah. Drill Sergeant.

120
00:04:10.266 --> 00:04:11.266
All right then...

121
00:04:13.467 --> 00:04:14.333
Hey!

122
00:04:14.467 --> 00:04:15.266
That's-- okay.

123
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.300
How about this?

124
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.266
I'll pay for the milkshake.

125
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.600
The problem is bigger.

126
00:04:22.734 --> 00:04:23.834
The problem is.

127
00:04:23.967 --> 00:04:26.467
is I want to help people be
the best they can be.

128
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.467
And that starts with fitness!

129
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.166
Exercise cures
a multitude of illnesses.

130
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.467
Depression. even.

131
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.934
I mean.
there's science to prove it!

132
00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:36.767
And when a client comes in
and orders--

133
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.633
Kate.

134
00:04:38.767 --> 00:04:41.834
You don't understand who I am
and what I stand for.

135
00:04:41.967 --> 00:04:43.700
Unfortunately. I do.

136
00:04:43.834 --> 00:04:44.800
And I don't want to work

137
00:04:44.934 --> 00:04:46.600
for a place that claims
to promote health

138
00:04:46.734 --> 00:04:48.667
and allows people
to grow more unhealthy.

139
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.000
You don't have to.

140
00:04:50.133 --> 00:04:51.800
- Excuse me?
- You're fired.

141
00:04:51.934 --> 00:04:53.500
Nigel. I...

142
00:04:53.633 --> 00:04:55.767
Collect your things. Please.

143
00:05:11.333 --> 00:05:13.767
Bye. Matt.

144
00:05:17.967 --> 00:05:20.133
I can't keep my mouth shut.

145
00:05:21.233 --> 00:05:23.367
Yo! Watch where
you're going. dude!

146
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.667
Watch what you're putting
in your body. "dude."

147
00:05:27.734 --> 00:05:29.200
It's my cheat day.

148
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.667
And then he said.
"Collect your things."

149
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.500
I'm so sorry. Kate.

150
00:05:43.633 --> 00:05:46.700
I just-- I don't know why
I can't keep my mouth shut.

151
00:05:46.834 --> 00:05:48.066
Because you care.

152
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.066
It's one of the best things
about you.

153
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.367
What am I gonna do now?

154
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.033
It was the best gym in the city.

155
00:05:54.166 --> 00:05:56.233
and L.A. is expensive.

156
00:05:56.367 --> 00:05:57.400
Oh. my gosh!

157
00:05:57.533 --> 00:05:58.233
What?

158
00:05:58.367 --> 00:05:59.834
Noth-- Nothing.

159
00:05:59.967 --> 00:06:01.800
I'm just watching
some Bridgerton.

160
00:06:01.934 --> 00:06:03.633
and Regé-Jean Page just...

161
00:06:03.767 --> 00:06:04.767
Never mind!

162
00:06:06.033 --> 00:06:07.300
Thanks.

163
00:06:07.433 --> 00:06:09.133
For?

164
00:06:09.266 --> 00:06:10.834
Making me smile.

165
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.900
Even from afar.

166
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.934
Well. how about
I make you smile even more?

167
00:06:19.066 --> 00:06:22.300
A little fresh air.
get you out of the smog?

168
00:06:22.433 --> 00:06:23.633
You catching what I'm saying?

169
00:06:23.767 --> 00:06:26.967
I don't think that this is
the right time for a vacation.

170
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.867
I was thinking more like
permanent vacation...

171
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.767
up here.
in Washington state.

172
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.200
When's your lease up?

173
00:06:33.333 --> 00:06:34.900
I'm month-to-month.

174
00:06:35.033 --> 00:06:36.400
Well. then come work for me!

175
00:06:36.533 --> 00:06:37.600
Work for you?

176
00:06:37.734 --> 00:06:39.900
Yes! Oh. m--
You should you see the place.

177
00:06:40.033 --> 00:06:41.100
It's been

178
00:06:41.233 --> 00:06:42.200
completely renovated.

179
00:06:42.333 --> 00:06:44.333
And a fitness instructor
from L.A..

180
00:06:44.467 --> 00:06:46.834
with your fabulous reputation

181
00:06:46.967 --> 00:06:48.900
would help bring clients
to the retreat.

182
00:06:49.033 --> 00:06:50.266
which I-I desperately need.

183
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.834
And you can stay here for free
until you figure things out.

184
00:06:53.967 --> 00:06:55.433
It's win/win for all of us!

185
00:06:55.567 --> 00:06:56.433
You know as well as I do.

186
00:06:56.567 --> 00:06:58.100
that Silver Springs
could use a boost

187
00:06:58.233 --> 00:07:00.100
since the fishery closed.

188
00:07:00.233 --> 00:07:03.000
And if we can get
my business booming.

189
00:07:03.133 --> 00:07:04.367
maybe it could help.

190
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.133
What do you think?

191
00:07:06.266 --> 00:07:07.734
I don't know.

192
00:07:07.867 --> 00:07:09.266
Your grandpa's land--

193
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.200
your land. actually--

194
00:07:11.333 --> 00:07:13.100
is still right here.
next to me.

195
00:07:13.233 --> 00:07:15.033
I guess
I could think about it.

196
00:07:15.166 --> 00:07:16.834
Not to reiterate the obvious.

197
00:07:16.967 --> 00:07:18.133
but...

198
00:07:18.266 --> 00:07:20.500
you don't have a man.
you don't have a job...

199
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.767
...and sounds to me like

200
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.367
you don't have a life plan
at this exact time.

201
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.533
Hey! Thanks a lot!

202
00:07:26.667 --> 00:07:28.333
So dare I say...

203
00:07:28.467 --> 00:07:30.734
you have no reason
to stay in L.A.?

204
00:07:31.834 --> 00:07:34.300
And I'm just your best friend
who needs you.

205
00:07:34.433 --> 00:07:35.767
Collect your things. sista.

206
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.734
You're coming home!

207
00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:39.033
♪ Get up!

208
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.300
♪ I don't wanna hear
That I can't ♪

209
00:07:47.433 --> 00:07:49.333
♪ 'Cause I can

210
00:07:49.467 --> 00:07:51.100
♪ I'm gettin' closer every day

211
00:07:51.233 --> 00:07:53.834
Come on! You got this!
You can do more!

212
00:07:53.967 --> 00:07:54.834
Come on!

213
00:07:54.967 --> 00:07:56.333
Go. go. go!

214
00:07:56.467 --> 00:07:57.867
And... we're done!

215
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.500
Good job. everyone!
I'll see you tomorrow!

216
00:08:01.633 --> 00:08:03.800
You're a miracle worker.

217
00:08:03.934 --> 00:08:05.400
Oh... moving your body

218
00:08:05.533 --> 00:08:07.200
is the best therapy
for arthritis.

219
00:08:07.333 --> 00:08:08.934
It reduces your pain
and stiffness.

220
00:08:09.066 --> 00:08:11.700
I can't believe how much better
I feel since you came.

221
00:08:11.834 --> 00:08:12.767
You're doing all the work.

222
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.000
I'm just here to encourage you.

223
00:08:15.133 --> 00:08:16.066
Kate.

224
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.900
Hey! What's up?

225
00:08:18.033 --> 00:08:19.400
Do you remember Liza Cahoone?

226
00:08:19.533 --> 00:08:20.533
The actress?

227
00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:22.266
I trained her for a movie
a few years ago.

228
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.200
Why do you ask?

229
00:08:24.333 --> 00:08:25.266
I just got off the phone
with the studio

230
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.266
that hired you
when you trained her.

231
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.233
They heard you were here

232
00:08:28.367 --> 00:08:29.333
and they want you
to do it again.

233
00:08:29.467 --> 00:08:31.100
I'm gonna meet
Liza Cahoone?

234
00:08:31.233 --> 00:08:32.400
No.

235
00:08:32.533 --> 00:08:33.700
Not Liza.

236
00:08:33.834 --> 00:08:35.066
They have another celebrity
they want Kate to train.

237
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.033
Oh! Holy macaroni!

238
00:08:37.166 --> 00:08:38.600
Well. who is it?
Come on. who?

239
00:08:38.734 --> 00:08:39.900
It seems like someone
super-famous.

240
00:08:40.033 --> 00:08:41.700
so it's very. very hush-hush.

241
00:08:41.834 --> 00:08:44.600
A one-month training intensive
to get the star into shape

242
00:08:44.734 --> 00:08:46.600
with super-fitness instructor
Kate Wolfe!

243
00:08:46.734 --> 00:08:49.367
Oh. this is the most exciting
thing to happen in this town

244
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.533
since last summer's fish fry.

245
00:08:50.667 --> 00:08:52.066
'Kay. so when
is this happening?

246
00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.967
- Tonight.
- Tonight?

247
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.333
Well. arrival tonight.
starting tomorrow.

248
00:08:56.467 --> 00:08:57.567
And I already promised
you'd do it.

249
00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.166
so I'm hoping
you're as excited as I am.

250
00:09:00.266 --> 00:09:00.967
I am.

251
00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:01.800
We are!

252
00:09:01.934 --> 00:09:03.467
You know.

253
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.166
most of these movie stars
are actually really motivated.

254
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.834
In fact. it's hard to find
an actor that is out-of-shape.

255
00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:12.100
at that type of level--

256
00:09:12.233 --> 00:09:13.934
you know. the type of level
where the studio pays

257
00:09:14.066 --> 00:09:15.166
for you to get into shape.

258
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.367
Could you imagine
if it's Tom Selleck?

259
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.467
Oh. there's a man
who can handle a 'stache.

260
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.333
Or. or...
Denzel Washington!

261
00:09:23.467 --> 00:09:24.633
Ooh!

262
00:09:24.767 --> 00:09:26.300
Or maybe...

263
00:09:26.433 --> 00:09:29.100
maybe it's...

264
00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:38.767
How'd you sleep?

265
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.600
Like a baby.

266
00:09:41.633 --> 00:09:43.300
That's good to hear.

267
00:09:43.433 --> 00:09:44.934
Who is it?

268
00:09:45.066 --> 00:09:45.967
This place is called
Silver Springs

269
00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:46.967
and you're all set
and ready to go

270
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.567
with your trainer
in the morning.

271
00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.500
What kind of trainer works
in the middle of nowhere?

272
00:09:50.633 --> 00:09:52.934
An A-lister. Rick.
who the studio has hired before.

273
00:09:53.066 --> 00:09:54.133
Right.

274
00:09:54.266 --> 00:09:55.266
Would you prefer L.A..

275
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.233
where every photographer
could watch you struggle

276
00:09:57.367 --> 00:09:58.333
to get back in shape?

277
00:09:58.467 --> 00:09:59.934
I'm in shape.

278
00:10:00.066 --> 00:10:01.500
Ha. Well. the studio
agrees to disagree.

279
00:10:01.633 --> 00:10:02.867
So. if you want to work again
you gotta--

280
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.266
I got it. Jared.

281
00:10:05.367 --> 00:10:06.834
What's that?

282
00:10:06.967 --> 00:10:08.066
A bike.

283
00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.100
Yeah. I kind of guessed that.

284
00:10:09.233 --> 00:10:10.100
I mean. why is it here?

285
00:10:10.233 --> 00:10:11.700
Nice bike!

286
00:10:11.834 --> 00:10:13.100
It was requested
that you bring one for training.

287
00:10:13.233 --> 00:10:14.867
You didn't hear it from me.

288
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.333
but I. uh. I arranged
a special kind of bike for you.

289
00:10:17.467 --> 00:10:18.734
Why are we whispering?

290
00:10:18.867 --> 00:10:20.567
There's a button on the side.
it's your friend.

291
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:21.967
But you didn't hear it from me.
so shh.

292
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.133
Button is my friend?

293
00:10:24.266 --> 00:10:25.400
Whatever you say.

294
00:10:27.633 --> 00:10:29.066
Turn around. Turn around.

295
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.200
Turn ar--

296
00:10:32.367 --> 00:10:33.367
I just wanna point out

297
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.533
that my face
is still the face

298
00:10:36.667 --> 00:10:38.500
of the most successful
spy-action movie franchise

299
00:10:38.633 --> 00:10:39.500
that ever existed.

300
00:10:39.633 --> 00:10:40.734
Face...

301
00:10:40.867 --> 00:10:41.667
yes.

302
00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.700
But the body. not so much.

303
00:10:43.834 --> 00:10:45.100
And unless we want to lose
our large fan base

304
00:10:45.233 --> 00:10:47.166
of middle-aged women to the next
young. sexy. good-looking--

305
00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.066
Hey!

306
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.834
I am still young...

307
00:10:49.967 --> 00:10:51.266
and. also. sexy.

308
00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.433
I empathize with you.

309
00:10:52.567 --> 00:10:53.467
I do.

310
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.734
I deal with my own
body image issues. okay?

311
00:10:55.867 --> 00:10:57.166
And if I sat out
an entire year

312
00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.100
eating junk food
and binge-watching TV--

313
00:10:59.233 --> 00:11:00.166
although. I must admit.

314
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.667
Bridgerton
was pretty binge-worthy--

315
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.433
after getting my heart torn out
and eaten by Liza Cahoone--

316
00:11:04.567 --> 00:11:06.533
Could you please
not mention her name?

317
00:11:06.667 --> 00:11:09.233
A name that shall never
be uttered again.

318
00:11:09.367 --> 00:11:11.567
I'm just saying.
I understand heartbreak.

319
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:12.800
but now.

320
00:11:12.934 --> 00:11:13.934
we're moving on.

321
00:11:14.066 --> 00:11:15.700
Let's get those big dollars
rolling back in. huh?

322
00:11:15.834 --> 00:11:17.300
Yeah.

323
00:11:17.433 --> 00:11:18.533
I'm headed
to a local hotel

324
00:11:18.667 --> 00:11:19.734
for the rest of the night.

325
00:11:19.867 --> 00:11:21.900
I'll try to keep
the paparazzi off your scent.

326
00:11:22.033 --> 00:11:23.133
And don't blow it. Rick.

327
00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:25.033
It's only 20 pounds.
but it's both of our careers

328
00:11:25.166 --> 00:11:26.367
on the line. huh?

329
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.233
You gotta hustle
for the muscle. Rick!

330
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.500
Yep. He needs a bit of exercise.

331
00:11:54.467 --> 00:11:55.467
Ohh.

332
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.967
Hello-o-o-o-o?

333
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.400
Beautiful day to get fit!

334
00:12:09.734 --> 00:12:10.934
Hello?

335
00:12:12.066 --> 00:12:14.033
Are you up?

336
00:12:24.533 --> 00:12:26.400
Oh. no.

337
00:12:27.533 --> 00:12:28.900
Mornin'.

338
00:12:29.033 --> 00:12:30.600
Rick Steele.

339
00:12:30.734 --> 00:12:32.300
The one and only.

340
00:12:32.433 --> 00:12:34.800
So. uh. morning run.

341
00:12:34.934 --> 00:12:36.767
I'm here to get you goin'.

342
00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.533
About that--
I got in rather late.

343
00:12:39.667 --> 00:12:41.500
It was 8:30.

344
00:12:41.633 --> 00:12:45.300
Didn't go to sleep until 2:00.
There was this really loud owl.

345
00:12:45.433 --> 00:12:48.000
Okay. so. I'll be sure to put
"fix sleeping schedule"

346
00:12:48.133 --> 00:12:49.066
on our list.
but. for now.

347
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.967
I need you to put
your running shoes on. so.

348
00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.400
Yeah. there's. um.
a problem with that.

349
00:12:54.533 --> 00:12:55.900
I might've forgotten them.

350
00:12:56.033 --> 00:12:57.100
Maybe.

351
00:13:00.133 --> 00:13:01.967
Uh. excuse me?

352
00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.867
This is kinda
my personal space here.

353
00:13:04.967 --> 00:13:06.333
You ordered pizza?

354
00:13:06.467 --> 00:13:09.300
Yeah! Local joint
delivers till midnight.

355
00:13:10.667 --> 00:13:12.867
- Cheese puffs...
- Uh. hey. that's my. um--

356
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.633
Ooh.

357
00:13:15.934 --> 00:13:18.266
Should I... get dressed first?

358
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.767
I'll wait for you out here.

359
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.200
Okay...

360
00:13:21.333 --> 00:13:22.667
great.

361
00:13:24.633 --> 00:13:26.066
Don't even think about it!

362
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.500
Can a person die of curiosity?

363
00:13:40.633 --> 00:13:43.033
I went by the cabin.
but you know Kate.

364
00:13:43.166 --> 00:13:45.033
She's probably been working
with the person

365
00:13:45.166 --> 00:13:46.367
since the sun came up.

366
00:13:47.633 --> 00:13:49.000
Excuse me?

367
00:13:49.133 --> 00:13:50.867
I'm looking for. uh.
Sasha Jones?

368
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.967
Oh. who's that?
He looks famous.

369
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.400
Shh! I don't know.

370
00:13:55.533 --> 00:13:57.200
Hi. I'm Sasha.

371
00:13:57.333 --> 00:13:59.967
- Hi. I'm Jared--
- Keep pushing!

372
00:14:00.166 --> 00:14:01.600
I remember!

373
00:14:01.734 --> 00:14:03.734
Remember what?

374
00:14:03.867 --> 00:14:05.166
You...

375
00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:06.900
the juicebar police.

376
00:14:07.033 --> 00:14:08.700
Keep moving!

377
00:14:08.834 --> 00:14:11.433
Oh. this is gonna be
one long month.

378
00:14:11.567 --> 00:14:13.066
Ohh.

379
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.266
Hey!

380
00:14:15.233 --> 00:14:17.767
Did Agent Darian Hall
just wave at me?

381
00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:18.734
Yes. he did.

382
00:14:18.867 --> 00:14:19.767
Ah!

383
00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.000
Um. as I was saying.

384
00:14:21.133 --> 00:14:24.567
uh. I'm Jared Munroe.
I'm Rick Steele's agent.

385
00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.166
Just making sure the studio
sent over the deposit.

386
00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:27.433
They did. Thank you.

387
00:14:27.567 --> 00:14:30.066
And you got the contract?
No social media. no cellphones?

388
00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.400
You can count
on our discretion.

389
00:14:32.533 --> 00:14:34.266
Great. And if there are
any updates.

390
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.100
um. you know. on him.

391
00:14:36.233 --> 00:14:37.700
feel free to message me.

392
00:14:37.834 --> 00:14:39.033
Okay.

393
00:14:39.166 --> 00:14:40.734
Staying local. so I'm only.
like. 10 minutes away.

394
00:14:40.867 --> 00:14:42.233
and. uh. I got a driver. too.

395
00:14:42.367 --> 00:14:46.367
uh. it's kinda like Uber
and Lyft. but not...

396
00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.000
Interesting.

397
00:14:48.133 --> 00:14:49.533
Actually. if you need a ride
anywhere. uh.

398
00:14:49.667 --> 00:14:52.100
like errands for groceries
or something like that.

399
00:14:52.233 --> 00:14:54.667
he could. uh. help you?

400
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.834
Okay. Yeah.
I'll keep that in mind.

401
00:14:56.967 --> 00:14:58.900
Okay.

402
00:14:59.033 --> 00:15:00.467
Did--
Did you want my number?

403
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.300
Yeah! Great.

404
00:15:01.433 --> 00:15:02.667
Yeah. that's a good idea.

405
00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.000
And if you have. like.
Instagram or social media...

406
00:15:06.133 --> 00:15:07.967
You mean the retreat's
Instagram. right?

407
00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.266
I'm kidding.

408
00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.166
Oh. you got jokes!

409
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.900
I like that.
I'll follow you.

410
00:15:16.033 --> 00:15:16.867
Okay.

411
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.166
On the socials.
not in real life.

412
00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:19.333
Yeah. I figured.

413
00:15:19.467 --> 00:15:21.066
Yeah. Bye. Miss!

414
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.533
Bye!

415
00:15:23.667 --> 00:15:25.400
A-ho!

416
00:15:25.533 --> 00:15:31.533
Look at that!

417
00:15:31.667 --> 00:15:35.800
Ah. And let's find our way
into a lotus position.

418
00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.367
Close our eyes...

419
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.133
breathe deeply.

420
00:15:43.333 --> 00:15:45.033
Ah...

421
00:15:46.367 --> 00:15:49.767
Thank you for sharing
your practice with me today.

422
00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:51.433
Namaste.

423
00:15:51.567 --> 00:15:53.333
Namaste.

424
00:15:53.467 --> 00:15:54.767
Thank you. everyone.

425
00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:56.367
Have a beautiful day.

426
00:15:57.867 --> 00:15:59.100
Problem. Mr. Steele?

427
00:15:59.233 --> 00:16:01.300
No. No. Everything's fine.

428
00:16:01.433 --> 00:16:03.734
Can take down a mercenary army.

429
00:16:03.867 --> 00:16:05.767
but you can't get out of
a yoga position?

430
00:16:10.433 --> 00:16:12.166
Appreciate it.

431
00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.767
Appreciation's all mine.
Agent Hall.

432
00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:15.767
I'm Minnie.

433
00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.834
It's good to meet you. Minnie.

434
00:16:17.967 --> 00:16:19.700
My name's actually Rick.

435
00:16:20.934 --> 00:16:22.200
Could you say the line?

436
00:16:22.333 --> 00:16:24.100
Like. just once?

437
00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.734
"I spy...
a beautiful woman."

438
00:16:32.834 --> 00:16:35.800
Okay. everyone!

439
00:16:35.934 --> 00:16:37.834
Agent Hall's
international espionage

440
00:16:37.967 --> 00:16:40.633
will have to wait
until after his weight training.

441
00:16:43.734 --> 00:16:45.066
Can you get up?

442
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.867
Of course.

443
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Let's see it. then.

444
00:16:48.133 --> 00:16:49.800
Yeah.

445
00:16:49.934 --> 00:16:51.533
You got it.

446
00:16:51.667 --> 00:16:53.800
Take your time.
Don't pull anything.

447
00:16:53.934 --> 00:16:55.367
Yeah.

448
00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.233
Just gotta. you know...

449
00:16:57.367 --> 00:16:58.800
flow up from the ground...

450
00:16:58.934 --> 00:17:01.100
to the... sky.

451
00:17:03.066 --> 00:17:04.567
Here you go.
Drill Sergeant.

452
00:17:06.066 --> 00:17:07.367
So. what is this place anyhow?

453
00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:08.767
A wellness retreat.

454
00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.266
Like a... fat camp?

455
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.533
No.

456
00:17:12.667 --> 00:17:14.367
Like. for people.

457
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.333
such as yourself.

458
00:17:16.467 --> 00:17:17.667
who want a reset.

459
00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.533
to get grounded
and to create healthy practices.

460
00:17:20.667 --> 00:17:21.700
Speaking of which.

461
00:17:21.834 --> 00:17:23.533
what's on the "healthy lunch"
menu for today?

462
00:17:23.667 --> 00:17:25.533
Probably something green.

463
00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.400
I feel like we've gotten off
to a rocky start.

464
00:17:31.533 --> 00:17:32.400
You know?

465
00:17:32.533 --> 00:17:33.500
When we first met.

466
00:17:33.633 --> 00:17:34.567
What do you mean?

467
00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.734
Well. the chocolate shake.

468
00:17:36.867 --> 00:17:38.200
and then the pizza.

469
00:17:38.333 --> 00:17:40.166
Sounds like you got off
to a rocky start.

470
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:41.166
not us.

471
00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.000
My point is.

472
00:17:43.133 --> 00:17:45.033
maybe we can start again?

473
00:17:45.166 --> 00:17:46.533
We did start over--

474
00:17:46.667 --> 00:17:48.734
this morning. with a run.

475
00:17:48.867 --> 00:17:50.066
You know what I mean.

476
00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.266
Are you trying to be nice

477
00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.200
so that you can eat
some french fries?

478
00:17:54.867 --> 00:17:57.700
Yeah. I just think it'd be
great if you and I could--

479
00:17:57.834 --> 00:17:58.567
You and I?

480
00:17:58.700 --> 00:17:59.800
Okay.

481
00:17:59.934 --> 00:18:01.333
Let's get one thing straight.

482
00:18:01.467 --> 00:18:02.667
There is no "you and I."

483
00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.266
"You" are
a slacking movie star

484
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.667
and "I" am a personal trainer

485
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.100
who was hired
to get you into shape.

486
00:18:10.233 --> 00:18:11.767
That's the extent
of you and I.

487
00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.266
And I'm really hoping
that you cooperate.

488
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.800
because. believe me.

489
00:18:15.934 --> 00:18:18.266
you do not want me
to start a point system.

490
00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.166
Point system?

491
00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:20.900
Yeah. Back in L.A..

492
00:18:21.033 --> 00:18:23.333
before the gym
was sold to Nigel.

493
00:18:23.467 --> 00:18:25.667
I had a kids' fitness camp.

494
00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:26.834
and they would each
get a point

495
00:18:26.967 --> 00:18:29.433
when they focused on
eating healthy and fitness.

496
00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:30.333
What were the prizes?

497
00:18:30.467 --> 00:18:31.500
Mm. Various stuff.

498
00:18:31.633 --> 00:18:33.133
like. uh. movie tickets.

499
00:18:33.266 --> 00:18:35.266
or passes
to animal rescue parks--

500
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.967
whatever we could get
donated to the cause.

501
00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:38.800
I do like animal rescue parks.

502
00:18:38.934 --> 00:18:39.800
I actually donate

503
00:18:39.934 --> 00:18:41.467
to organizations
like that myself.

504
00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:42.967
Fine.

505
00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:46.100
One point toward
an animal rescue park--

506
00:18:46.233 --> 00:18:48.367
if Mr. Steele...

507
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.567
eats a green smoothie for lunch.

508
00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.500
Does that mean Miss Wolfe
is going to make a chart

509
00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:54.667
with stickers

510
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.900
to help keep Mr. Steele
on track?

511
00:18:57.033 --> 00:18:58.600
Are you talking
in the third person?

512
00:18:58.734 --> 00:18:59.934
It's a thing
Rick does sometimes.

513
00:19:00.133 --> 00:19:01.200
Yes.

514
00:19:01.333 --> 00:19:03.400
Kate will make a chart
for Mr. Steele.

515
00:19:03.533 --> 00:19:06.800
And with that. dare I say...

516
00:19:06.934 --> 00:19:09.433
I spy a thoughtful woman.

517
00:19:10.934 --> 00:19:13.834
And I spy an uphill battle.

518
00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:17.233
Am I supposed to follow you?

519
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.066
Oh...

520
00:19:31.033 --> 00:19:33.000
What?

521
00:19:33.133 --> 00:19:36.066
"I have confiscated
all your snacks.

522
00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.367
I've also threatened
the pizza boy.

523
00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.400
Kate."

524
00:19:41.467 --> 00:19:43.233
Why would you threaten him?

525
00:19:44.767 --> 00:19:46.200
Ohh.

526
00:19:46.333 --> 00:19:48.166
Oh...

527
00:19:50.333 --> 00:19:51.633
Not all my snacks.

528
00:19:57.333 --> 00:19:59.133
"Healthy choices."

529
00:19:59.266 --> 00:20:01.967
Healthy choices...

530
00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.066
At least you survived
the first day.

531
00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.166
Agent Darian Hall.

532
00:20:11.266 --> 00:20:12.200
Hmm.

533
00:20:25.633 --> 00:20:27.533
Much farther?

534
00:20:27.667 --> 00:20:30.467
Cardio before breakfast
can help burn fat.

535
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.700
Better be a waiter
with eggs Benedict up here.

536
00:20:33.834 --> 00:20:35.800
I told you
that this would be better

537
00:20:35.934 --> 00:20:38.867
than doing cardio inside
on a treadmill.

538
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.033
Well. I feel like

539
00:20:40.166 --> 00:20:42.533
we could've at least started
on the treadmill.

540
00:20:42.667 --> 00:20:44.200
So. what's gonna happen

541
00:20:44.333 --> 00:20:47.834
when Agent Hall
chases Hanz Franden

542
00:20:47.967 --> 00:20:49.867
up the steepest hill
in Spain?

543
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.300
What. you want
to be out of breath

544
00:20:51.433 --> 00:20:52.900
for your new movie?

545
00:20:53.033 --> 00:20:54.166
You read the script?

546
00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:56.500
Yeah. they sent me
a few of your stunt scenes.

547
00:20:56.633 --> 00:20:59.867
The studio wants you primed
and sculpted.

548
00:21:00.066 --> 00:21:01.767
There's nothin' wrong
with a dad-bod.

549
00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.433
I feel like 70%
of the male population

550
00:21:04.567 --> 00:21:05.633
has a dad-bod.

551
00:21:05.767 --> 00:21:07.133
Dad-bods are cool!

552
00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:08.700
Right.

553
00:21:08.834 --> 00:21:10.266
You ready?

554
00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.500
For?

555
00:21:11.633 --> 00:21:14.033
For your uphill training
to Spain?

556
00:21:19.834 --> 00:21:21.233
Wow! What the...?

557
00:21:21.367 --> 00:21:23.367
Second wind!
Come on. keep up!

558
00:21:26.166 --> 00:21:28.900
Wow! That's impressive.

559
00:21:29.934 --> 00:21:31.467
Sometimes I am.

560
00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:33.467
You ready?

561
00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.100
What now?

562
00:21:35.233 --> 00:21:37.200
Come on!

563
00:21:44.767 --> 00:21:46.934
This is Lion's Leap.

564
00:21:47.066 --> 00:21:49.433
Sea lions. to be exact.

565
00:21:49.567 --> 00:21:52.166
They like to sun
themselves here.

566
00:21:54.266 --> 00:21:56.734
Well...

567
00:21:56.867 --> 00:21:58.600
I'll admit it.

568
00:21:58.734 --> 00:22:01.500
This view makes me
temporarily forget

569
00:22:01.633 --> 00:22:02.967
that I'm miserable.

570
00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.066
Here you go.

571
00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:09.533
But if that is my breakfast.
I will quickly be reminded.

572
00:22:09.667 --> 00:22:12.200
Protein. fiber. vitamins.

573
00:22:12.333 --> 00:22:14.066
And... it keeps you full longer.

574
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.867
Lion's Leap. you say?

575
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.066
Mm-hmm.

576
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.367
Breakfast like this.
I just might leap off myself.

577
00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:23.066
Why are you
hating on this so much?

578
00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.200
I think that'd be obvious.

579
00:22:25.333 --> 00:22:27.200
especially to someone with--

580
00:22:27.333 --> 00:22:28.834
what was it. two degrees?

581
00:22:30.166 --> 00:22:34.333
You know.
I've come to learn that...

582
00:22:34.467 --> 00:22:36.400
those who don't
take care of themselves

583
00:22:36.533 --> 00:22:39.367
have a deeper reason
than they'd like to admit.

584
00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:42.133
Degree in psychology
also in your mix?

585
00:22:43.367 --> 00:22:44.467
You don't want to have
a conversation about it.

586
00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:45.433
that's fine.

587
00:22:45.567 --> 00:22:47.567
Listen.

588
00:22:48.667 --> 00:22:51.233
I know I've gained
a lot of weight this past year.

589
00:22:51.367 --> 00:22:56.400
The reason I got this heavy
is not up for discussion.

590
00:22:56.533 --> 00:22:57.700
But...

591
00:22:57.834 --> 00:23:01.233
if you're wondering if
I'm comfortable in my own skin?

592
00:23:01.367 --> 00:23:02.867
The answer's no.

593
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.767
I'm not.

594
00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.400
I think a lot of people
can relate to that feeling.

595
00:23:07.533 --> 00:23:10.400
Problem is.
unlike other folks.

596
00:23:10.533 --> 00:23:12.800
I'm outta work if I don't
do something about it.

597
00:23:12.934 --> 00:23:14.467
That's kind of harsh.

598
00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.934
I'd like to feel sorry
for you. but...

599
00:23:17.066 --> 00:23:18.333
I can't.

600
00:23:18.467 --> 00:23:20.767
I'm not looking for sympathy.

601
00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:24.266
Most people aren't
in a position financially

602
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:29.100
to have the luxury of working
with someone such as myself.

603
00:23:29.233 --> 00:23:31.233
I know.

604
00:23:31.367 --> 00:23:35.600
You know. this isn't about
losing weight. Rick.

605
00:23:35.734 --> 00:23:40.567
So let's just focus on creating
some new. healthy habits.

606
00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:41.767
Seeds and nuts.

607
00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:43.867
- Mm-hmm.
- Got it.

608
00:23:47.533 --> 00:23:49.367
So what about you?

609
00:23:51.233 --> 00:23:52.266
What about me?

610
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.333
Well. last time I checked.

611
00:23:53.467 --> 00:23:54.934
you were working at

612
00:23:55.066 --> 00:23:57.500
one of the most exclusive
fitness centers in L.A.

613
00:23:58.533 --> 00:23:59.667
I was.

614
00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.800
And now you're here.

615
00:24:01.934 --> 00:24:03.700
Mm! Let me guess.

616
00:24:03.834 --> 00:24:05.433
"I seized the opportunity

617
00:24:05.567 --> 00:24:07.533
to find myself
in the great outdoors."

618
00:24:07.667 --> 00:24:09.967
As a matter of fact. yes.

619
00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:11.834
Ah. baloney!

620
00:24:11.967 --> 00:24:15.333
Did you actually
just say "baloney"?

621
00:24:15.467 --> 00:24:16.600
You know what?

622
00:24:16.734 --> 00:24:20.500
I just thought of a way
to make this thing actually fun.

623
00:24:20.633 --> 00:24:22.000
Oh. you did. did you?

624
00:24:22.133 --> 00:24:23.033
- Yeah. I did.
- Huh!

625
00:24:23.166 --> 00:24:24.000
Oh.

626
00:24:24.133 --> 00:24:25.367
While you're figuring me out.

627
00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.200
I'm gonna spend time
figuring you out.

628
00:24:28.333 --> 00:24:30.533
There isn't any "figuring out"
to be had.

629
00:24:30.667 --> 00:24:32.567
Oh. yeah. there is.
Miss Wolfe.

630
00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:34.000
You see. not only do I play

631
00:24:34.133 --> 00:24:35.633
one of Hollywood's
most beloved spies.

632
00:24:35.767 --> 00:24:37.266
but I'm also an actor.

633
00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.934
And. as an actor.

634
00:24:40.066 --> 00:24:43.367
it's my job
to notice things about people.

635
00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.934
Studying people
is what I do.

636
00:24:46.066 --> 00:24:47.033
So. yeah.

637
00:24:47.166 --> 00:24:51.100
this big ol' spy's just gonna
figure you out.

638
00:24:51.233 --> 00:24:52.600
Hmm.

639
00:24:52.734 --> 00:24:53.667
Are you done eating?

640
00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:54.667
Stuffed!

641
00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.100
Oh. good.

642
00:24:56.233 --> 00:24:59.967
Come on. Mr. Funny Guy.
let's get moving.

643
00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:01.767
Thank you.

644
00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:03.367
- Got everything?
- Yup.

645
00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.633
Ohh!

646
00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:13.900
You know. Ron loves Tina.

647
00:25:14.033 --> 00:25:15.900
"Ron loves Tina"?
What are you talking about?

648
00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.734
Defacing nature?

649
00:25:20.867 --> 00:25:23.567
Who would do that?

650
00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:25.500
Uh. Ron?

651
00:25:27.033 --> 00:25:29.667
I hope
it didn't hurt the tree.

652
00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.567
It's obviously been there
for years.

653
00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:32.867
Tree's fine.

654
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.734
I mean. it's driftwood.

655
00:25:36.367 --> 00:25:37.934
But this little jaunt
down lovers' lane

656
00:25:38.066 --> 00:25:41.000
has given me my first clue about
who the real Kate Wolfe is.

657
00:25:42.066 --> 00:25:43.100
Most women would've found

658
00:25:43.233 --> 00:25:46.433
poor lovesick Ron's carving
very romantic.

659
00:25:46.567 --> 00:25:47.667
They would have imagined

660
00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.033
the tender moment at Lion's Leap

661
00:25:50.166 --> 00:25:51.900
between Ron and Tina

662
00:25:52.033 --> 00:25:54.233
that prompted Ron
to express his love

663
00:25:54.367 --> 00:25:55.867
in such a public
and permanent way.

664
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:56.867
Not you!

665
00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.166
No! You were concerned
about the tree.

666
00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.467
and not the love story.

667
00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.500
I think we need another chart.

668
00:26:03.633 --> 00:26:05.066
one where I give you a sticker

669
00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:08.967
for every time my spy skills
unearth something about you.

670
00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:13.133
Admittedly. today's
a big thumbs-down. but...

671
00:26:13.266 --> 00:26:15.967
I have wrestled
a giant Pacific octopus

672
00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.767
all while safely detonating
an underwater bomb

673
00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.667
meant to destroy
all of Japan.

674
00:26:22.066 --> 00:26:23.700
So don't underestimate me.

00:27:22.867 --> 00:27:24.100
and you just try to pull away.

698
00:27:24.233 --> 00:27:25.400
Away from you?

699
00:27:25.533 --> 00:27:27.467
Best news I've heard
since getting here.

700
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.033
The goal
is to work out your core.

701
00:27:30.166 --> 00:27:31.133
Ah. You forget--

702
00:27:31.266 --> 00:27:33.233
I have skydived
while clutching

703
00:27:33.367 --> 00:27:35.700
a microchip
containing the genetic mutations

704
00:27:35.834 --> 00:27:37.467
of an underground
insect rebellion--

705
00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.533
without a parachute.
by the way.

706
00:27:39.667 --> 00:27:40.667
Core's fine.

707
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.000
I guess we'll see.

708
00:27:42.133 --> 00:27:43.900
- Do you have a hobby?
- A hobby?

709
00:27:44.033 --> 00:27:45.300
How someone spends
their free time

710
00:27:45.433 --> 00:27:46.333
says a lot about them.

711
00:27:46.467 --> 00:27:47.867
Nope. No hobby.

712
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.834
What about
when you were a kid?

713
00:27:49.967 --> 00:27:51.400
Maybe a...

714
00:27:51.533 --> 00:27:52.567
sticker collection?

715
00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:55.633
I wasn't
a sticker-collecting kinda kid.

716
00:27:55.767 --> 00:27:58.133
But I did go fishing a lot.

717
00:27:58.266 --> 00:27:59.567
So you lived near water.

718
00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.467
Okay. as much as
I'm thoroughly enjoying

719
00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.200
you fishing for facts.

720
00:28:03.333 --> 00:28:04.700
I need to ask you one thing.

721
00:28:04.834 --> 00:28:05.734
What's that?

722
00:28:05.867 --> 00:28:06.800
Are you ready?

723
00:28:07.934 --> 00:28:10.133
You told 'em
no cellphone videos. right?

724
00:28:10.266 --> 00:28:12.066
I mean. I wouldn't want you
embarrassed online.

725
00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.700
Cellphones haven't been
allowed at the retreat

726
00:28:14.834 --> 00:28:15.834
since you got here.

727
00:28:15.967 --> 00:28:17.767
Besides. these are good people.

728
00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:21.033
Even good people can be
convinced by a tabloid payday.

729
00:28:21.166 --> 00:28:22.300
You got this. Agent Hall!

730
00:28:22.433 --> 00:28:23.500
We're rooting for you.

731
00:28:23.633 --> 00:28:25.900
Oh! Looks like
you have a cheerleader.

732
00:28:26.033 --> 00:28:29.033
And you thought she would
sell your picture to a tabloid.

733
00:28:29.166 --> 00:28:29.867
Mm.

734
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:30.867
Okay.

735
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.734
Go slow at first.

736
00:28:35.533 --> 00:28:36.900
Whoa! Whoa!

737
00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.400
Like that?

738
00:28:40.533 --> 00:28:43.000
Not exactly.

739
00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.400
Do you want-- Do you want me
to-to try it with him?

740
00:28:49.533 --> 00:28:50.567
I could have a go!

741
00:28:52.266 --> 00:28:54.867
Slow.

742
00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.533
Come on.

743
00:29:01.667 --> 00:29:02.900
Use that core!

744
00:29:05.467 --> 00:29:06.700
Avocado for lunch?

745
00:29:06.834 --> 00:29:07.934
After seeds for breakfast?

746
00:29:08.066 --> 00:29:08.934
You'll love it!

747
00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:14.433
Now. guacamole
with fresh tortilla chips--

748
00:29:14.567 --> 00:29:16.367
that I can support.

749
00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:18.500
Eating it plain
is good for you. Again!

750
00:29:20.734 --> 00:29:22.300
Do you ever bend the rules?

751
00:29:22.433 --> 00:29:24.166
You know. cheat?
Like. even a little?

752
00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.967
"Discipline"
is my middle name.

753
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.667
How about sleep in?

754
00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.567
Chocolate bunny at Easter?

755
00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.333
Caramel apple at Halloween?

756
00:29:32.467 --> 00:29:34.266
If you are asking me

757
00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.266
if I eat chocolate--

758
00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.300
I do. but not every day.

759
00:29:38.433 --> 00:29:39.567
As for you?

760
00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:42.166
You shouldn't even be thinking
about breaking the rules.

761
00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:43.633
You're doing great.

762
00:29:43.767 --> 00:29:45.100
but you're not in a position--

763
00:29:45.233 --> 00:29:46.200
Favorite color!

764
00:29:47.567 --> 00:29:49.867
Come on. humor me!
I got my own chart to complete.

765
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.500
Avocado green.

766
00:29:51.633 --> 00:29:53.700
Ew. Like. from the '70s?

767
00:29:53.834 --> 00:29:55.500
Yeah. like '70s avocado green.

768
00:29:55.633 --> 00:29:57.633
That's horrific.

769
00:29:57.767 --> 00:29:58.667
So would I find. like.

770
00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.467
a lava lamp
in your cabin too. or--?

771
00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.834
Kate. you almost ready?

772
00:30:01.967 --> 00:30:02.934
Uh. yeah.

773
00:30:04.233 --> 00:30:05.633
Where--
where are you two going?

774
00:30:05.767 --> 00:30:08.266
Uh. we have some business
in town.

775
00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:11.000
and seeing as you don't want
anyone to know you're here...

776
00:30:11.133 --> 00:30:13.333
Well. what's in town?

777
00:30:13.467 --> 00:30:14.867
Oh. my son is the mayor.

778
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.834
We're going to see him
about Kate and Sasha's idea to--

779
00:30:17.967 --> 00:30:21.433
Yeah. and. uh. make sure
that you do some. uh. squats.

780
00:30:22.567 --> 00:30:23.700
What was that? An idea to--?

781
00:30:23.834 --> 00:30:25.800
And body surfing

782
00:30:25.934 --> 00:30:28.700
so that you get
an upper-body workout.

783
00:30:28.834 --> 00:30:30.467
Go see Sasha down at the beach.

784
00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.700
Uh-huh.
Minnie. I have a request.

785
00:30:32.834 --> 00:30:33.867
- A request?
- Mm-hmm.

786
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:34.867
Sure! What is it?

787
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.333
Bag of potato chips?

788
00:30:37.834 --> 00:30:40.500
Yeah. you and me both.

789
00:30:40.633 --> 00:30:41.867
Work out. Steele.

790
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.367
Work out.

791
00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:44.633
I got eyes everywhere!

792
00:30:44.767 --> 00:30:46.066
Sour cream and onion.

793
00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:51.734
Sasha will take care of you.

794
00:30:51.867 --> 00:30:54.367
She lived right over there.s.

795
00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:55.867
So you've been friends
for a long time.

796
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.800
Mm-hmm. Best friends.

797
00:30:58.934 --> 00:31:00.433
How is your cabin?

798
00:31:00.567 --> 00:31:01.767
Is everything
to your satisfaction?

799
00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:03.767
Yeah.

800
00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:05.266
What about her parents?

801
00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.633
They still live here?

802
00:31:06.767 --> 00:31:08.767
No. they passed away.

803
00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:11.200
Cancer.

804
00:31:11.333 --> 00:31:12.533
Both of 'em?

805
00:31:12.667 --> 00:31:13.934
Mm-hmm.

806
00:31:14.066 --> 00:31:15.433
Wow.

807
00:31:15.567 --> 00:31:17.266
I guess that makes sense.

808
00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.266
What does?

809
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:21.066
Just some of the stuff
she says.

810
00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.467
You know?

811
00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.800
About her focus on health.

812
00:31:24.934 --> 00:31:26.233
Yeah. she was raised
by her grand...

813
00:31:26.367 --> 00:31:27.367
pa.

814
00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:32.467
If your pillow is too firm.
we have others.

815
00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:33.533
Grandfather. huh?

816
00:31:33.667 --> 00:31:35.233
Is he still here?

817
00:31:35.367 --> 00:31:37.300
No.

818
00:31:37.433 --> 00:31:40.400
Did you get a chance to take
advantage of our spa services?

819
00:31:40.533 --> 00:31:41.400
A hot-stone massage--

820
00:31:41.533 --> 00:31:42.667
Any idea
why she went into town?

821
00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:43.700
It seemed important.

822
00:31:43.834 --> 00:31:45.100
Well. it is.

823
00:31:45.233 --> 00:31:46.166
She has a plan to--

824
00:31:47.567 --> 00:31:49.433
'Kay. one thing
I know about Kate

825
00:31:49.567 --> 00:31:51.934
is that she likes to keep
her private life private.

826
00:31:52.066 --> 00:31:55.200
While I'd love to answer
more of your questions.

827
00:31:55.333 --> 00:31:56.400
you should really
ask Kate yourself.

828
00:31:56.533 --> 00:31:58.900
Fair enough.

829
00:31:59.033 --> 00:32:02.433
What you need to know most
about Kate.

830
00:32:02.567 --> 00:32:04.867
is that she takes
her job seriously.

831
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.667
She wants you to succeed. Rick.

832
00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:10.200
And she cares about
changing your habits

833
00:32:10.333 --> 00:32:12.700
so that you can be
the best version of yourself.

834
00:32:12.834 --> 00:32:14.700
She has no hidden agenda.

835
00:32:14.834 --> 00:32:17.266
That's refreshing.

836
00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.000
You know where
we keep our boards?

837
00:32:19.133 --> 00:32:19.967
Hmm?

838
00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:21.000
Doesn't Kate want you
to go paddling?

839
00:32:21.133 --> 00:32:24.333
Yes. I. uh...
I'm gonna head there now.

840
00:32:24.467 --> 00:32:25.600
Just that way. right?

841
00:32:25.734 --> 00:32:27.133
Yeah.

842
00:32:27.266 --> 00:32:29.834
I'm gonna...

843
00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.200
Eeeny-meeny-miney...

844
00:32:35.333 --> 00:32:36.200
no.

845
00:32:39.066 --> 00:32:44.200
♪ The weather outside
Is getting pretty warm ♪

846
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:49.834
♪ But I just think it's funny
How summer is so short ♪

847
00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:57.033
♪ It's the good times
You can't ignore ♪

848
00:33:03.233 --> 00:33:04.900
How long

849
00:33:05.033 --> 00:33:06.200
have you been lounging?

850
00:33:06.333 --> 00:33:07.767
I just sat down.

851
00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:10.700
Mm. What activities
did you do while I was gone?

852
00:33:11.734 --> 00:33:12.900
I lifted a bagel.

853
00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.200
Break is over.

854
00:33:16.333 --> 00:33:19.066
Kate. it's just one afternoon.

855
00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.734
Tomorrow. you will have
been here for a week.

856
00:33:21.867 --> 00:33:23.066
Do you know what that means?

857
00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:24.934
This nightmare is 25% over?

858
00:33:25.066 --> 00:33:26.567
Progress report.

859
00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:28.333
And that means?

860
00:33:28.467 --> 00:33:30.667
You do not
want to sit this day out.

861
00:33:31.767 --> 00:33:33.066
Are you asking me
or telling me?

862
00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.000
I'm telling you!

863
00:33:34.133 --> 00:33:35.600
The studio wants me

864
00:33:35.734 --> 00:33:37.734
to send a report
once a week.

865
00:33:37.867 --> 00:33:39.433
I feel like
I'm in kindergarten.

866
00:33:39.567 --> 00:33:41.100
You're their golden boy

867
00:33:41.233 --> 00:33:43.367
and they are paying
a lot of money

868
00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:44.734
to get you into shape.

869
00:33:44.867 --> 00:33:46.100
Clearly. they care.

870
00:33:46.233 --> 00:33:47.734
They are protecting
their investment.

871
00:33:47.867 --> 00:33:48.934
is what they're doing.

872
00:33:49.066 --> 00:33:50.867
Well. I can't blame them.

873
00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.400
In my line of work.

874
00:33:54.533 --> 00:33:58.133
genuine concern for health
doesn't really exist.

875
00:33:58.266 --> 00:34:01.433
"Look good"
is more the name of the game.

876
00:34:01.567 --> 00:34:03.266
Well. that's about to change.

877
00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:05.467
Here! Put this on.

878
00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.834
I think you're gonna enjoy
what we're about to do.

879
00:34:07.967 --> 00:34:09.700
A wet suit?

880
00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.233
Let's go. Steele!
Move it or lose it!

881
00:34:17.967 --> 00:34:19.266
I feel like
I'm five years old.

882
00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.633
about to learn
how to swim again.

883
00:34:20.767 --> 00:34:22.133
Well. the ocean
is invigorating.

884
00:34:22.266 --> 00:34:24.834
Plus. I think this is way better
than lifting weights in a gym.

885
00:34:24.967 --> 00:34:26.300
and you can get cardio in.

886
00:34:26.433 --> 00:34:27.500
There's no waves.

887
00:34:27.633 --> 00:34:30.166
Well. you don't need waves.
It's a full-body workout.

888
00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:31.633
Alright.
now you're gonna get on.

889
00:34:31.767 --> 00:34:32.834
and you just start to paddle.

890
00:34:32.967 --> 00:34:35.066
you kick your legs.
do all the things.

891
00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.433
Like in swim class.

892
00:34:36.567 --> 00:34:37.567
Okay.

893
00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:39.767
- Just get on and paddle.
- Three. two. one. go!

894
00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:43.433
Alright. you got this!

895
00:34:43.567 --> 00:34:45.166
You go for it!

896
00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.934
Yeah! Faster. faster. faster!

897
00:34:48.066 --> 00:34:50.600
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

898
00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:53.967
♪ Just slow it down

899
00:34:55.734 --> 00:34:57.934
♪ Enjoy the good times

900
00:34:58.066 --> 00:34:59.967

903
00:35:05.767 --> 00:35:06.667
Come on!

904
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.500
Cold plunging
has a lot of health benefits.

905
00:35:10.633 --> 00:35:12.000
It's a lot colder
than it looks--

906
00:35:12.133 --> 00:35:13.066
even with the extra layer.

907
00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.500
Ah. you'll get used to it.

908
00:35:39.467 --> 00:35:40.433
I love it here!

909
00:35:42.867 --> 00:35:44.100
Pretty good.

910
00:35:46.934 --> 00:35:47.700
Yes!

911
00:35:47.834 --> 00:35:48.934
I don't know
if I can top that.

912
00:35:49.066 --> 00:35:52.700
Alright. let's see what
you've got there. Agent Hall.

913
00:35:52.834 --> 00:35:53.900
You know. I'm reminded

914
00:35:54.033 --> 00:35:55.967
of "The Night of Reckoning
at World's End."

915
00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:58.700
when you shot a man
from a thousand yards away.

916
00:35:58.834 --> 00:36:00.133
and this is what.
like. six feet?

917
00:36:00.266 --> 00:36:02.000
I feel like you're trying
to distract me.

918
00:36:02.133 --> 00:36:03.533
Yeah. that's the point.

919
00:36:03.667 --> 00:36:04.533
Oh!

920
00:36:04.667 --> 00:36:06.367
Look at that!

921
00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:08.433
Kate. three.
Rick. one.

922
00:36:08.567 --> 00:36:10.433
♪ Oh... oh. oh. oh. oh

923
00:36:10.567 --> 00:36:11.433
Hey!

924
00:36:11.567 --> 00:36:12.633
Hey!

925
00:36:12.767 --> 00:36:13.633
Hey!

926
00:36:13.767 --> 00:36:14.633
What are you doing here?

927
00:36:14.767 --> 00:36:16.367
Oh. you know.
just bored at the hotel.

928
00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:18.600
I thought
I'd see what's going on here

929
00:36:18.734 --> 00:36:20.467
and what's poppin'.

930
00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:21.633
Is. uh. Sasha here?

931
00:36:21.767 --> 00:36:23.266
- Sasha?
- Yeah. Sasha.

932
00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.500
Oh! There she is.

933
00:36:24.633 --> 00:36:29.066
Ahem! Friday night at
Silver Springs Wellness Retreat!

934
00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:32.934
Let's all welcome Mr. Steele
to our weekly campfire.

935
00:36:35.066 --> 00:36:36.567
Thank you. Thank you.

936
00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:38.200
I wish I could say
it's been my pleasure.

937
00:36:38.333 --> 00:36:39.867
but there's been
far too much pain.

938
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:41.834
You're welcome.

939
00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:45.900
And. uh. Rick's
Hollywood agent. Jared.

940
00:36:46.033 --> 00:36:47.400
is also here tonight.

941
00:36:47.533 --> 00:36:48.900
Whoo! Hollywood!

942
00:36:50.834 --> 00:36:53.700
Well. enjoy. everyone.
Vegan S'mores on the house.

943
00:36:53.834 --> 00:36:55.367
Oh...

944
00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:56.967
Hey.

945
00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:58.266
You're back.

946
00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.867
Yeah. You know. my job
is sorta like babysitting.

947
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.333
so I just wanted to make sure

948
00:37:02.467 --> 00:37:04.266
and come by
and see my superstar.

949
00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.000
Right.

950
00:37:06.133 --> 00:37:07.166
Funny seeing you here.

951
00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:10.333
Wasn't expecting that.
Such a coincidence.

952
00:37:10.467 --> 00:37:11.734
Well...

953
00:37:11.867 --> 00:37:13.867
it is my retreat. so.

954
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.300
Right!

955
00:37:15.433 --> 00:37:17.100
Right. right.
That makes sense.

956
00:37:17.233 --> 00:37:19.333
Uh-uh-uh!
Don't even think about it.

957
00:37:19.467 --> 00:37:21.967
Did she not just say
"vegan S'mores"?

958
00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:23.300
Yeah. Not for us.

959
00:37:23.433 --> 00:37:25.333
But grab two of those

960
00:37:25.467 --> 00:37:27.233
and take a seat.

961
00:37:30.233 --> 00:37:32.467
I have another
little snack for us.

962
00:37:34.734 --> 00:37:37.567
Ho. ho. ho. Yes.

963
00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.300
It's been an exhausting week.

964
00:37:40.433 --> 00:37:42.700
so I'm sure my eyes
are playing tricks on me.

965
00:37:42.834 --> 00:37:43.934
but is that...

966
00:37:44.066 --> 00:37:45.500
cauliflower?

967
00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:49.033
Roasted cauliflower
is delicious!

968
00:37:49.166 --> 00:37:50.467
Here. hand me one of those.

969
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.367
And the spices
that I bring with it... ohh!

970
00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:56.633
Tasty.

971
00:37:56.767 --> 00:37:57.633
Okay.

972
00:37:57.767 --> 00:37:59.133
I thought I'd done it all.

973
00:37:59.266 --> 00:38:01.066
But here I am.
on a Friday night.

974
00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:03.900
sitting by a campfire
in the middle of nowhere.

975
00:38:04.033 --> 00:38:06.066
about to roast a vegetable.

976
00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:10.600
Looks like I've surprised
this jaded international spy.

977
00:38:14.567 --> 00:38:16.367
So tell me
about growing up here.

978
00:38:17.567 --> 00:38:19.166
Who told you
I grew up here?

979
00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.500
I just... heard about it.

980
00:38:21.633 --> 00:38:23.166
Huh.

981
00:38:24.834 --> 00:38:26.467
It's one of my rules.

982
00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:27.934
More rules?

983
00:38:28.066 --> 00:38:30.500
I have two strict rules
with clients.

984
00:38:30.633 --> 00:38:31.600
Just two?

985
00:38:31.734 --> 00:38:33.500
I would've guessed
at least ten.

986
00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:36.433
First is...

987
00:38:36.567 --> 00:38:39.567
I never talk about
my personal life.

988
00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:41.834
I just asked
about your childhood.

989
00:38:41.967 --> 00:38:43.567
Didn't ask for
your social security number

990
00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:44.500
or something.

991
00:38:46.867 --> 00:38:47.934
What's the second?

992
00:38:48.066 --> 00:38:50.867
Doesn't matter 'cause
it's. um. not gonna come up.

993
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.100
Let me guess.

994
00:38:52.233 --> 00:38:53.567
Never dare to be rare.

995
00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:55.367
and swap the veggies
for marshmallows?

996
00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:56.700
Nope.

997
00:38:56.834 --> 00:38:57.867
Come on!

998
00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.500
Tell me. What is it?

999
00:39:01.433 --> 00:39:04.900
I never. ever date a client.

1000
00:39:05.867 --> 00:39:08.934
Well. you don't have to worry
about that one too much with me.

1001
00:39:09.066 --> 00:39:11.834
I mean. technically.
I'm not the client.

1002
00:39:11.967 --> 00:39:13.934
The studio's the client.

1003
00:39:14.066 --> 00:39:15.166
And if they were
to come out here.

1004
00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:16.867
they're like a gaggle of people.

1005
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.033
so dating the lot of them would
be very. very time-consuming.

1006
00:39:21.133 --> 00:39:22.834
And you don't date
clients anyway.

1007
00:39:22.967 --> 00:39:24.100
so it's not gonna happen.

1008
00:39:24.233 --> 00:39:25.867
We're good.

1009
00:39:32.133 --> 00:39:34.667
Well. what kind of presentation?

1010
00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:35.834
Ohh.

1011
00:39:35.967 --> 00:39:38.767
Oh. I'm sure
I can figure something out.

1012
00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:41.100
Really. with the way
Silver Springs is struggling.

1013
00:39:41.233 --> 00:39:43.700
you'd think the council
would jump at an oppor--

1014
00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:47.233
You forget. Mayor.
that I grew up here. too.

1015
00:39:47.367 --> 00:39:49.633
I know how stubborn
the people can be.

1016
00:39:49.767 --> 00:39:50.934
If it's not about fishing.

1017
00:39:51.066 --> 00:39:52.500
then they don't give it
any value.

1018
00:39:52.633 --> 00:39:54.600
When's the next
town hall meeting?

1019
00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:57.333
Three weeks?

1020
00:39:57.467 --> 00:39:59.433
That's not gonna be easy.

1021
00:39:59.567 --> 00:40:04.767
I'm working with a very tough
out-of-town client right now.

1022
00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:07.500
But. uh. I'll be ready.

1023
00:40:07.633 --> 00:40:11.834
And. uh. I meant
to tell you yesterday.

1024
00:40:11.967 --> 00:40:14.500
thank you for the kind things
you said about my grandpa.

1025
00:40:14.633 --> 00:40:16.800
I miss him so much.

1026
00:40:16.934 --> 00:40:18.100
I know that he would want us

1027
00:40:18.233 --> 00:40:20.000
to use the land
for something like this.

1028
00:40:21.133 --> 00:40:23.166
Okay. Thanks. Bye.

1029
00:40:25.734 --> 00:40:26.600
Morning. Coach.

1030
00:40:26.734 --> 00:40:27.767
Morning.

1031
00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:29.767
Ready to get this over with?

1032
00:40:30.867 --> 00:40:32.767
Now. no matter what
the scale says.

1033
00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:36.900
remember that this is a process
and every body is different.

1034
00:40:44.734 --> 00:40:46.367
Oh!

1035
00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:47.500
Yes.

1036
00:40:47.633 --> 00:40:48.767
Bike ride?

1037
00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:50.734
You know it.

1038
00:40:53.367 --> 00:40:55.600
I can see why you'd trade L.A.
for all this.

1039
00:40:55.734 --> 00:40:57.400
Except for the owl.

1040
00:40:58.633 --> 00:41:00.867
You know why he's so loud
at night. don't you?

1041
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.300
He wants to keep me
from sleeping?

1042
00:41:02.433 --> 00:41:04.433
No. He's protecting
his territory.

1043
00:41:04.567 --> 00:41:07.066
fending off
any would-be intruders.

1044
00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:08.700
He thinks I'm a threat?

1045
00:41:09.834 --> 00:41:11.033
I think it's more other owls.

1046
00:41:11.166 --> 00:41:12.834
but if you want
to make it personal...

1047
00:41:12.967 --> 00:41:14.200
He's a menace.

1048
00:41:14.333 --> 00:41:16.600
Like my grandpa used to say.
that--

1049
00:41:18.133 --> 00:41:22.400
"I wasn't raised in the woods
to be scared of owls."

1050
00:41:22.533 --> 00:41:24.133
Your grandpa
wasn't easily shaken.

1051
00:41:24.266 --> 00:41:25.834
That's an understatement.

1052
00:41:25.967 --> 00:41:28.533
I was 10 years old
when I showed up at his door.

1053
00:41:28.667 --> 00:41:30.033
waiting to be raised.

1054
00:41:30.166 --> 00:41:32.567
He was a 67-year-old widower.

1055
00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.333
I obviously never knew him.

1056
00:41:34.467 --> 00:41:36.000
but. somehow.
I get the feeling

1057
00:41:36.133 --> 00:41:38.233
that raising you
brought him great joy.

1058
00:41:38.367 --> 00:41:40.500
And he did a pretty good job.
I might add!

1059
00:41:40.633 --> 00:41:42.967
You're a remarkable person. Kate.

1060
00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:44.500
You really are.

1061
00:41:44.633 --> 00:41:48.133
Come on. super-spy!
We got another hill to climb.

1062
00:42:00.667 --> 00:42:02.266
Come on. Coach! Pick it up.

1063
00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:05.133
Hey! Rick!

1064
00:42:06.333 --> 00:42:08.233
Hey! Stop!

1065
00:42:09.533 --> 00:42:11.734
What?

1066
00:42:11.867 --> 00:42:13.800
Is that an electric?

1067
00:42:14.834 --> 00:42:17.400
I'm guessing that's
a thumbs-down for today?

1068
00:42:17.533 --> 00:42:21.367
Uh. yeah. that is
a huge thumbs-down for today.

1069
00:42:22.333 --> 00:42:25.333
All right.
Let's get back to it.

1070
00:42:26.333 --> 00:42:27.600
Come on!

1071
00:42:37.033 --> 00:42:38.066
Minnie!

1072
00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.867
Agent Hall.

1073
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.934
Aw. come on.

1074
00:42:42.066 --> 00:42:44.033
Please. call me Rick.

1075
00:42:44.166 --> 00:42:45.567
Okay.

1076
00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:46.633
"Rick."

1077
00:42:48.667 --> 00:42:50.300
Looking good.
doing those sit-ups.

1078
00:42:50.433 --> 00:42:51.800
Yeah.

1079
00:42:51.934 --> 00:42:52.800
I still have to get to mine.

1080
00:42:52.934 --> 00:42:54.166
Why don't you join me?

1081
00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:56.567
Oh! Okay.

1082
00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:57.567
Sure.

1083
00:42:57.700 --> 00:42:59.100
Oh.

1084
00:42:59.233 --> 00:43:01.433
Well. this is fun.

1085
00:43:03.734 --> 00:43:06.000
Working out with Agent Hall.

1086
00:43:06.133 --> 00:43:07.800
I mean. "Rick."

1087
00:43:07.934 --> 00:43:09.500
Yeah.

1088
00:43:09.633 --> 00:43:12.233
So... here we go.

1089
00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:15.200
So I lost four pounds already.

1090
00:43:15.333 --> 00:43:16.266
Oh! Good.

1091
00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:18.367
Yeah. personally.
I think it's the keto.

1092
00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:20.100
- Losing the carbs. you know?
- Yeah.

1093
00:43:20.233 --> 00:43:23.667
Carbs are most peoples'
devil in disguise.

1094
00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:25.433
Mm-hmm.
- My friend. Betty. though--

1095
00:43:25.567 --> 00:43:29.867
she says it's all part
of being female. post-menopause.

1096
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.533
Right.

1097
00:43:31.667 --> 00:43:34.867
Anyhow. I don't think
these sit-ups are doing much.

1098
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.834
Yeah. me neither.

1099
00:43:36.967 --> 00:43:37.967
Listen.

1100
00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:40.333
I've been meaning to ask you
about something.

1101
00:43:40.467 --> 00:43:42.333
Ask me about something?

1102
00:43:42.467 --> 00:43:46.266
It's kind of a...
special-mission type of thing.

1103
00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:47.467
A mission?

1104
00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:51.266
I know that Kate's trying
to help Sasha and the town.

1105
00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:52.367
Who told you?

1106
00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:54.066
Let's just say...

1107
00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:55.433
I heard about it.

1108
00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:57.967
And I think

1109
00:43:58.100 --> 00:43:59.200
I could really use your help

1110
00:43:59.333 --> 00:44:01.066
organizing some things
regarding it.

1111
00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:02.500
- Like a partner?
- Mm-hmm.

1112
00:44:02.633 --> 00:44:04.467
Like Lola Lurner in

1113
00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:06.500
"Race to Save the World
at Midnight"?

1114
00:44:06.633 --> 00:44:07.367
Exactly.

1115
00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:08.734
Oh. I loved that movie!

1116
00:44:08.867 --> 00:44:11.033
It's a good one.

1117
00:44:11.166 --> 00:44:13.433
Kate. You like her. don't ya?

1118
00:44:13.567 --> 00:44:14.800
Um--

1119
00:44:14.934 --> 00:44:16.500
I'll tell ya what--

1120
00:44:16.633 --> 00:44:20.166
I'm gonna join your mission.
since you're joining Kate's.

1121
00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:21.667
Hmm?

1122
00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:23.066
So...

1123
00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.166
what do we do first?

1124
00:44:26.867 --> 00:44:29.800
Come on! Let's go!

1125
00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.667
Come on. you go this.
Let's go!

1126
00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:35.400

I've know her
since she was a little girl.

00:44:44.033 --> 00:44:45.066

- Yeah.

1136
00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:56.500

And when you want to.

1143
00:45:17.433 --> 00:45:20.600
find your way into
a seated upright position...

1144
00:45:22.266 --> 00:45:24.667
...with your hands open.

1145
00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:27.333
Now. I want you to picture
one year from now.

1146
00:45:29.867 --> 00:45:33.066
What do you want
your life to be like?

1147
00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.767
Breathe that in.

1148
00:45:36.834 --> 00:45:38.734
Through the nose...

1149
00:45:38.867 --> 00:45:41.000
...and out through the mouth.

1150
00:45:43.266 --> 00:45:45.233
And how will you get there?

1151
00:45:46.934 --> 00:45:48.266
Visualize

1152
00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:51.233
what it is
that you need to do.

1153
00:45:53.467 --> 00:45:56.633
What people
do you want by your side?

1154
00:45:56.767 --> 00:45:59.133
The ones that make you feel

1155
00:45:59.266 --> 00:46:02.900
like you can be
the best you can be.

1156
00:46:07.767 --> 00:46:10.500
Thank you for sharing
your practice with me today.

1157
00:46:10.633 --> 00:46:12.934
Namaste.

1158
00:46:13.967 --> 00:46:15.333
Namaste.

1159
00:46:18.967 --> 00:46:20.867
- She's amazing. isn't she?
- Mm-hmm.

1160
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.567
He's putty in her hands.

1161
00:46:23.667 --> 00:46:24.667
Don't forget about us.

1162
00:46:25.767 --> 00:46:28.433
...When you have another
out-of-shape movie star client.

1163
00:46:28.567 --> 00:46:31.900
Think "Silver Springs
Wellness Retreat."

1164
00:46:32.033 --> 00:46:33.400
Yeah. I don't think
I'll be able

1165
00:46:33.533 --> 00:46:35.767
to forget
the beautiful things here.

1166
00:46:36.934 --> 00:46:38.734
See that you don't.

1167
00:46:40.333 --> 00:46:42.300
27...

1168
00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:44.367
Ooh...

1169
00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:46.867
Jared and Sasha?

1170
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.967
Some spy you are.

1171
00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:51.233
They've been spending
a lot of time together.

1172
00:46:51.367 --> 00:46:52.533
Really?

1173
00:46:52.667 --> 00:46:53.533
Hey.

1174
00:46:53.667 --> 00:46:56.333
Don't get distracted.
Agent Hall.

1175
00:46:56.467 --> 00:46:57.567
I'm not distracted.

1176
00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:01.133
Not by Jared. anyway.

1177
00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:18.900
♪ Mm...

1178
00:47:30.734 --> 00:47:32.233
♪ There is something

1179
00:47:32.367 --> 00:47:33.900
♪ Ahh

1180
00:47:34.033 --> 00:47:35.700
♪ In the air

1181
00:47:35.834 --> 00:47:37.400
And then the cable broke.

1182
00:47:37.533 --> 00:47:39.300
And there I was--
hanging from the bar.

1183
00:47:39.433 --> 00:47:40.734
praying I could hold on.

1184
00:47:40.867 --> 00:47:42.900
Oh. I would've been petrified.

1185
00:47:43.033 --> 00:47:44.567
I was only
10 feet off the ground.

1186
00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:45.734
but when the film was finished.

1187
00:47:45.867 --> 00:47:47.200
it looked like
I was high in the air.

1188
00:47:47.333 --> 00:47:49.266
hanging from the helicopter.

1189
00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:51.133
That was my first
"Agent Darian Hall" film.

1190
00:47:51.266 --> 00:47:54.367
back when the studio allowed me
to do some of my own stunts.

1191
00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:55.633
Not anymore.

1192
00:47:55.767 --> 00:47:56.633
No?

1193
00:47:56.767 --> 00:47:57.633
Mm.

1194
00:47:57.767 --> 00:47:59.767
Nah. Protect their investment.
remember?

1195
00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:01.533
The stunt guy
does everything now.

1196
00:48:01.667 --> 00:48:03.033
And you don't like that?

1197
00:48:03.166 --> 00:48:05.800
Well. Tom Cruise
does his own stunts.

1198
00:48:06.967 --> 00:48:08.900
I know. I must sound silly
complaining about it.

1199
00:48:09.033 --> 00:48:09.934
No. you don't!

1200
00:48:10.066 --> 00:48:11.700
Just sounds like
you love what they do--

1201
00:48:11.834 --> 00:48:13.800
I can relate to that.

1202
00:48:14.834 --> 00:48:15.800
Hey! Um...

1203
00:48:15.934 --> 00:48:18.300
Actually. I forgot that I...

1204
00:48:18.433 --> 00:48:19.667
have something for you.

1205
00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:22.000
Let me guess.
A vegetable?

1206
00:48:26.734 --> 00:48:29.834
Proof that you did it
with one week to spare.

1207
00:48:29.967 --> 00:48:31.533
Look at all those thumbs up!

1208
00:48:31.667 --> 00:48:34.133
Once you ditched the pizza.
you were a dream client.

1209
00:48:34.266 --> 00:48:35.633
Wait.

1210
00:48:35.767 --> 00:48:37.300
My ears must be plugged
or something.

1211
00:48:37.433 --> 00:48:40.600
Did Kate Wolfe just call me
a "dream client"?

1212
00:48:40.734 --> 00:48:42.200
Well. you were.

1213
00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:45.033
What about my prize.
Miss Wolfe?

1214
00:48:45.166 --> 00:48:48.500
Ah. yeah. the prize--
that's right.

1215
00:48:48.633 --> 00:48:50.433
I'll make it easy on you.

1216
00:48:50.567 --> 00:48:52.500
How about...

1217
00:48:52.633 --> 00:48:54.467
a last hike in the morning.
before I go?

1218
00:48:55.734 --> 00:48:57.800
I think I can make that work.

1219
00:49:05.133 --> 00:49:07.934
I'm gonna miss you. Kate.

1220
00:49:08.066 --> 00:49:09.433
You are?

1221
00:49:09.567 --> 00:49:11.667
Yeah.

1222
00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:16.734
Thanks.

1223
00:49:16.867 --> 00:49:18.767
Yeah. reached my goal.

1224
00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:21.266
Hoo-hoo! He's back. baby.
Watch out. world!

1225
00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:23.767
Listen. Jared.

1226
00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:26.233
Uh. do you think
you can stall the studio?

1227
00:49:26.367 --> 00:49:28.600
I was originally scheduled
to stay one more week anyway.

1228
00:49:28.734 --> 00:49:29.767
Oh. you like
the great outdoors

1229
00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:31.200
that much.
you wanna stay now?

1230
00:49:31.333 --> 00:49:34.100
There's just something
I want to do.

1231
00:49:34.233 --> 00:49:35.667
Ah. sounds suspect.

1232
00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:37.567
Everything sounds suspect
with you.

1233
00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:38.633
This is true.

1234
00:49:38.767 --> 00:49:40.066
Listen. I admit.
there's something I want to do

1235
00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:42.033
while we're here. too.
so. I'll make the call.

1236
00:49:42.166 --> 00:49:43.066
Oh!

1237
00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:44.700
- Everything all right?
- Yeah. yeah. yeah.

1238
00:49:44.834 --> 00:49:45.700
Everything's cool.

1239
00:49:45.834 --> 00:49:46.834
Sasha just told me
to watch Outlander.

1240
00:49:46.967 --> 00:49:48.433
and this scene is good.

1241
00:49:48.567 --> 00:49:50.834
All right. well.
I'll let you get back to it.

1242
00:49:50.967 --> 00:49:52.266
Oh. okay. cool.
I'll to you later.

1243
00:49:53.367 --> 00:49:54.433
Outlander?

1244
00:49:54.567 --> 00:49:55.767
Chyoo!

1245
00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:57.266
Oh. my gosh.

1246
00:50:17.066 --> 00:50:19.967
"Walk to the beach
to claim your prize."

1247
00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:28.600
What are you up to?

1248
00:50:28.734 --> 00:50:31.200
You earned it--
fair and square.

1249
00:50:31.333 --> 00:50:35.166
Welcome to the Silver Springs
Rescue Zoo.

1250
00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:36.734
Now. be careful.

1251
00:50:36.867 --> 00:50:39.300
Wild animals
can be unpredictable.

1252
00:50:39.433 --> 00:50:41.233
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1253
00:50:41.367 --> 00:50:42.367
Now. over here.

1254
00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:44.567
we have the very popular...

1255
00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:46.033
purple polar bear.

1256
00:50:46.166 --> 00:50:47.033
Oh?

1257
00:50:47.166 --> 00:50:48.066
Mm-hmm.

1258
00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:50.266
Now. something fierce--

1259
00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:52.200
Is that a wolf?

1260
00:50:54.867 --> 00:50:56.033
"Kate Junior"?

1261
00:50:56.166 --> 00:50:58.700
Well. how else are you gonna
remember me. Mr. Hollywood?

1262
00:50:58.834 --> 00:51:00.166
Well. I have to say.

1263
00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:02.266
I've certainly
become fond of Wolfes lately.

1264
00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:04.834
Dangerous when
you first meet them--

1265
00:51:04.967 --> 00:51:07.667
almost feels like you're gonna
get your head torn off

1266
00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:08.667
if you don't follow
their lead.

1267
00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:09.900
- Is that so?
- Mm-hmm.

1268
00:51:10.033 --> 00:51:11.800
The Wolfe
is a fierce leader!

1269
00:51:11.934 --> 00:51:13.233
But loyal.

1270
00:51:13.367 --> 00:51:15.867
Beautiful.

1271
00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:18.266
Shall we pack these up?

1272
00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:20.166
Do I get to keep them?

1273
00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:21.000
Of course.

1274
00:51:21.133 --> 00:51:22.934
Especially that penguin there.

1275
00:51:23.066 --> 00:51:24.900
Took a lot of work
to get that one.

1276
00:51:34.333 --> 00:51:35.467
Ooh.

1277
00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:36.967
My favorite.

1278
00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:41.166
The studio actually
is gonna let me

1279
00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:43.133
do some of my own stunts
this time.

1280
00:51:43.266 --> 00:51:44.633
They want me to stay
for my final week.

1281
00:51:45.734 --> 00:51:47.400
Think you can find the time?

1282
00:51:47.533 --> 00:51:50.133
Mm. I think
I could squeeze you in.

1283
00:51:50.266 --> 00:51:52.100
They did hire me
to get you into shape

1284
00:51:52.233 --> 00:51:53.934
for the big silver screen.

1285
00:51:54.066 --> 00:51:56.166
And you know.
it's uncanny--

1286
00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:59.400
you are starting to look
just like Agent Hall.

1287
00:52:00.367 --> 00:52:01.800
Don't forget. he's a spy.

1288
00:52:01.934 --> 00:52:02.800
How could I?

1289
00:52:02.934 --> 00:52:04.934
You remind me daily.

1290
00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:09.300
I know what you've been
working on.

1291
00:52:10.467 --> 00:52:12.734
Well. I've been working on
getting you into shape.

1292
00:52:12.867 --> 00:52:14.133
so. that makes sense.

1293
00:52:14.266 --> 00:52:15.400
I mean...

1294
00:52:15.533 --> 00:52:18.133
I know that you inherited
your grandfather's land.

1295
00:52:18.266 --> 00:52:20.300
that's next to the retreat.

1296
00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:23.667
And I know that you're trying
to convince the council

1297
00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:25.700
to approve rezoning it.

1298
00:52:25.834 --> 00:52:28.900
so you and Sasha can start
a fitness camp for kids.

1299
00:52:30.467 --> 00:52:33.000
You believe this will not only
help your friend.

1300
00:52:33.133 --> 00:52:35.967
but it will also help
your hometown.

1301
00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:37.700
and I know that it's your way
of helping out families

1302
00:52:37.834 --> 00:52:40.166
who have been hit
with the unlucky.

1303
00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:44.967
You've helped me.
so it's my turn to help you.

1304
00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:46.467
What do you mean?

1305
00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:49.800
You're trying to convince
a town that resists change.

1306
00:52:49.934 --> 00:52:52.166
and even if it's good for them.

1307
00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:54.300
it might take
a little more action

1308
00:52:54.433 --> 00:52:55.734
to get them on your side.

1309
00:52:56.734 --> 00:52:58.500
I might know a little bit
about that.

1310
00:52:59.633 --> 00:53:02.500
How in the world
did you find all this out?

1311
00:53:02.633 --> 00:53:04.800
Oh. right. you're a spy.
How could I forget?

1312
00:53:04.934 --> 00:53:07.433
When production companies
are trying to sell a movie idea.

1313
00:53:07.567 --> 00:53:08.700
you know what they do?

1314
00:53:08.834 --> 00:53:10.700
What?

1315
00:53:10.834 --> 00:53:13.200
They try and attach
a famous actor to their project.

1316
00:53:13.333 --> 00:53:14.600
Almost guarantees success.

1317
00:53:14.734 --> 00:53:16.100
Hmm.

1318
00:53:16.233 --> 00:53:17.100
I'll be sure to remember that

1319
00:53:17.233 --> 00:53:19.133
the next time
I'm making a movie.

1320
00:53:19.266 --> 00:53:20.633
What if I go with you?

1321
00:53:20.767 --> 00:53:22.100
To the council meeting?

1322
00:53:22.233 --> 00:53:23.800
You would--?

1323
00:53:23.934 --> 00:53:25.367
Attach myself to your project.

1324
00:53:27.033 --> 00:53:29.734
But your presence
at the retreat.

1325
00:53:29.867 --> 00:53:31.600
it's a secret
and people could--

1326
00:53:31.734 --> 00:53:34.133
One week until
you present the whole idea

1327
00:53:34.266 --> 00:53:35.300
at the town hall meeting. right?

1328
00:53:35.433 --> 00:53:37.367
Oh. they moved it to Wednesday.

1329
00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:39.567
Well. then we better
get started.

1330
00:53:42.533 --> 00:53:44.100
You really would do this?

1331
00:53:44.233 --> 00:53:46.133
Don't make me turn into
a drill sergeant. Kate.

1332
00:53:46.266 --> 00:53:48.700
You will not like getting
a taste of your own medicine.

1333
00:53:48.834 --> 00:53:51.066
Come on. Wolfe!
Pick it up!

1334
00:53:56.834 --> 00:53:57.800
Dammit.

1335
00:53:59.934 --> 00:54:00.767
Come on. Rick.

1336
00:54:05.133 --> 00:54:07.467
And there's
a house on the land.

1337
00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:10.200
I was thinking
I could fix it up.

1338
00:54:10.333 --> 00:54:12.300
Living up here full-time?

1339
00:54:12.433 --> 00:54:13.867
Sounds like a dream.

1340
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.533
Really does.

1341
00:54:15.667 --> 00:54:18.600
And the kids' camp. well...

1342
00:54:19.667 --> 00:54:21.633
...when my parents were sick.

1343
00:54:21.767 --> 00:54:23.633
it was really hard.

1344
00:54:23.767 --> 00:54:26.066
There wasn't a lot of support.

1345
00:54:27.266 --> 00:54:29.800
And then
when my dad got diagnosed.

1346
00:54:29.934 --> 00:54:32.000
one year after my mom passed.

1347
00:54:32.133 --> 00:54:33.667
I was visiting him
in the hospital.

1348
00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:36.834
and I met this little girl--

1349
00:54:36.967 --> 00:54:38.467
cancer. too.

1350
00:54:40.066 --> 00:54:43.266
And she always talked about
her summers at the cottage.

1351
00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:45.567
and that stuck with me.

1352
00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:51.500
And that's where my idea
for the kids' camp came from.

1353
00:54:51.633 --> 00:54:52.934
So that's it. then.

1354
00:54:53.066 --> 00:54:54.667
What?

1355
00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:56.467
Your strong focus
on health and fitness

1356
00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:58.433
and helping others to achieve
a healthier lifestyle.

1357
00:54:58.567 --> 00:55:00.900
It could be your reaction
to losing them.

1358
00:55:01.033 --> 00:55:03.033
Maybe.

1359
00:55:03.166 --> 00:55:04.467
I guess.

1360
00:55:05.567 --> 00:55:07.867
What was it you told me?

1361
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.567
That people often have
deeper reasons

1362
00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:12.133
for not taking care
of themselves?

1363
00:55:12.266 --> 00:55:14.667
Well...

1364
00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:17.767
my deeper reason
is Liza Cahoone.

1365
00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:19.667
Liza?

1366
00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:21.266
I know her.

1367
00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:23.333
Broke up
a year and a half ago.

1368
00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:26.066
I'm sorry.

1369
00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:28.000
I thought she was
the love of my life.

1370
00:55:28.133 --> 00:55:30.233
only to find out
she was cheating--

1371
00:55:30.367 --> 00:55:32.533
behind my back.
for six months.

1372
00:55:32.667 --> 00:55:34.500
Wow.

1373
00:55:34.633 --> 00:55:37.667
I actually found out
from a tabloid magazine.

1374
00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:38.934
believe it or not.

1375
00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:42.567
Did not see it coming.

1376
00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:43.867
Sat on the couch
feeling miserable

1377
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.900
for almost
four months straight.

1378
00:55:46.967 --> 00:55:48.033
Anyhow.

1379
00:55:48.166 --> 00:55:49.500
My point is--

1380
00:55:49.633 --> 00:55:53.000
maybe. just like me.

1381
00:55:53.133 --> 00:55:54.767
you have deeper reasons

1382
00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:57.767
for not letting yourself be
the happiest you can be. too.

1383
00:55:59.033 --> 00:56:02.800
And how do you think
I can be happier. Rick?

1384
00:56:02.934 --> 00:56:05.667
Maybe you could
let go of your rules?

1385
00:56:07.133 --> 00:56:08.333
Even consider breaking one?

1386
00:56:08.467 --> 00:56:10.266
One that involves a man

1387
00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:13.166
who just might make you
feel as happy as you make him?

1388
00:56:16.133 --> 00:56:18.433
Let me help you get ready
for this presentation.

1389
00:56:18.567 --> 00:56:21.767
and while we do.
maybe we could...

1390
00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:23.633
I don't know--

1391
00:56:23.767 --> 00:56:25.333
spend even more time together?

1392
00:56:27.066 --> 00:56:28.066
You in?

1393
00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:30.000
I'm in.

1394
00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:43.100
So. there's another trail

1395
00:56:43.233 --> 00:56:44.600
I'd love to take you on
at some point. It's--

1396
00:56:44.734 --> 00:56:46.967
Rick. Rick! Come-- Come here.

1397
00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:48.934
Uno momento! Sorry!

1398
00:56:49.066 --> 00:56:50.100
Hey. Ahem.

1399
00:56:50.233 --> 00:56:51.100
Where have you been?

1400
00:56:51.233 --> 00:56:52.300
I've been trying
to get in touch with you.

1401
00:56:52.433 --> 00:56:53.300
What's going on?

1402
00:56:53.433 --> 00:56:54.433
After the studio said

1403
00:56:54.567 --> 00:56:55.800
you should work here
for another week--

1404
00:56:55.934 --> 00:56:57.333
- Yeah?
- They made another request.

1405
00:56:57.467 --> 00:56:58.633
Okay. Name it.

1406
00:56:58.767 --> 00:57:01.500
Well. they. uh. finally
decided on your costar.

1407
00:57:01.633 --> 00:57:03.200
- Great!
- And they want her

1408
00:57:03.333 --> 00:57:05.700
to come up here
and get Kate to train you both.

1409
00:57:05.834 --> 00:57:07.233
Kate can train us both!

1410
00:57:07.367 --> 00:57:08.333
- Kate?
- Yeah?

1411
00:57:08.467 --> 00:57:11.233
Yeah. they want you guys
to. uh. practice on

1412
00:57:11.367 --> 00:57:12.834
some. uh. action scenes together.

1413
00:57:12.967 --> 00:57:14.567
You know. they thought
it would be like. uh.

1414
00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:15.633
how can I say this?

1415
00:57:15.767 --> 00:57:17.700
...uh. chemistry building?

1416
00:57:17.834 --> 00:57:19.166
Chemistry building's
always a good idea.

1417
00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:20.166
Yeah.

1418
00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:21.567
Did they send a new script?

1419
00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:22.900
Oh. they sent more than that.

1420
00:57:23.033 --> 00:57:24.800
Huh.

1421
00:57:30.266 --> 00:57:31.033
Liza?

1422
00:57:32.133 --> 00:57:34.000
Hi. Kate!

1423
00:57:34.133 --> 00:57:35.900
Liza!

1424
00:57:36.033 --> 00:57:37.033
It's so good to see you again.

1425
00:57:37.166 --> 00:57:39.567
- Uh. you too.
- What's happening?

1426
00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:43.633
And my goodness.
look at this guy.

1427
00:57:44.834 --> 00:57:46.200
You look good. Rick.

1428
00:57:46.333 --> 00:57:47.166
You're a miracle-worker.

1429
00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:48.166
Oh.

1430
00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:49.266
It's great to see you again.

1431
00:57:50.333 --> 00:57:51.834
Really great.

1432
00:57:51.967 --> 00:57:59.100
You too.

1433
00:58:00.834 --> 00:58:02.467
The challenge is on.

1434
00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:05.400
"Beautiful foreign agent
Nora Nether Regions--"

1435
00:58:05.533 --> 00:58:06.600
"Nora Nether."

1436
00:58:06.734 --> 00:58:08.400
Love the name. right?

1437
00:58:08.533 --> 00:58:09.900
It's a great name.

1438
00:58:10.033 --> 00:58:10.934
Alright. enough chit-chat.

1439
00:58:11.066 --> 00:58:12.767
Can we just get through
the scene. please?

1440
00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:14.400
Of course. right.

1441
00:58:14.533 --> 00:58:17.834
"Nora approaches Agent Hall.
with the knife in her hand

1442
00:58:17.967 --> 00:58:20.066
and fire in her eyes."

1443
00:58:21.667 --> 00:58:24.934
Um... "As the jet ascends
to 10.000 feet.

1444
00:58:25.066 --> 00:58:28.533
"Nora and Agent Hall
circle one another on the wing.

1445
00:58:28.667 --> 00:58:31.233
Agent Hall does not
want to kill her

1446
00:58:31.367 --> 00:58:32.600
if he doesn't have to."

1447
00:58:32.734 --> 00:58:34.166
I wouldn't
be so sure about that.

1448
00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:35.100
What was that?

1449
00:58:35.233 --> 00:58:36.433
Improvising.

1450
00:58:36.567 --> 00:58:39.266
"Bruno Rifat
exits the plane with--"

1451
00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:40.633
Wait.

1452
00:58:40.767 --> 00:58:44.100
Bruno Rifat was
the short. bald villain. right?

1453
00:58:44.233 --> 00:58:45.767
Didn't he die
three movies ago?

1454
00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:48.367
Yeah. he did.
but he was so popular.

1455
00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:50.166
they decided to bring him back

1456
00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:52.700
and just say that he'd been
hiding out in the Amazon.

1457
00:58:52.834 --> 00:58:53.533
Huh.

1458
00:58:53.667 --> 00:58:55.033
Okay.

1459
00:58:55.166 --> 00:58:58.233
"Bruno Rifat exits the plane.
ready for combat.

1460
00:58:58.367 --> 00:59:01.100
He lunges towards Hall.
grabbing his shirt.

1461
00:59:01.233 --> 00:59:02.500
tearing it off of him."

1462
00:59:02.633 --> 00:59:04.500
Oh. this is gonna be good.

1463
00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:09.000
"And then jumps onto
Agent Hall's back."

1464
00:59:09.133 --> 00:59:10.066
Okay. Kate.

1465
00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:11.433
You're gonna need to be Bruno.

1466
00:59:11.567 --> 00:59:12.567
What? No. I'm not.

1467
00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:14.867
Minnie. can you take over
reading the scene?

1468
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.600
Rick. I can teach you
how to do a stunt.

1469
00:59:17.734 --> 00:59:18.600
but I'm not an actor.

1470
00:59:18.734 --> 00:59:21.767
Give me that script. Bruno.

1471
00:59:26.367 --> 00:59:28.567
What? Script called for it!

1472
00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:29.467
Ahh...

1473
00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:30.734
Okay. Uh. Liza?

1474
00:59:30.867 --> 00:59:33.333
Make sure you keep
your active hand up.

1475
00:59:33.467 --> 00:59:34.800
Yep.

1476
00:59:34.934 --> 00:59:35.800
Uh. your "active hand"

1477
00:59:35.934 --> 00:59:37.300
is the one
not holding the weapon.

1478
00:59:37.433 --> 00:59:39.100
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1479
00:59:39.233 --> 00:59:41.600
Good. So now we're gonna
work out the stunt.

1480
00:59:41.734 --> 00:59:43.767
You don't look anything
like a short. bald guy.

1481
00:59:45.367 --> 00:59:46.467
Minnie. what now?

1482
00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:47.767
Oh. Ahem.

1483
00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:49.467
"Despite the conditions.

1484
00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:53.066
Agent Hall knows
he must defeat Bruno.

1485
00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:55.333
if he hopes to save Nora."

1486
00:59:55.467 --> 00:59:57.800
Ah. he's probably
still thinking about

1487
00:59:57.934 --> 00:59:59.266
their passion-filled night
on the Rhine.

1488
00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:00.333
four scenes ago.

1489
01:00:00.467 --> 01:00:01.400
Okay. Minnie.

1490
01:00:01.533 --> 01:00:02.533
Sorry. Um...

1491
01:00:02.667 --> 01:00:07.133
"Agent Hall swings Bruno
from his back...

1492
01:00:07.266 --> 01:00:10.500
throws Bruno onto the wing
in front of him.

1493
01:00:10.633 --> 01:00:12.433
He leans over Bruno.

1494
01:00:12.567 --> 01:00:18.467
looks directly in his eyes
with steely determination

1495
01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:19.934
and says--"

1496
01:00:21.066 --> 01:00:22.133
Well. go ahead.

1497
01:00:22.266 --> 01:00:24.133
You ready? Cowboy up.

1498
01:00:24.266 --> 01:00:25.133
Yep.

1499
01:00:25.266 --> 01:00:27.166
Wait. I-I don't see a cowboy.

1500
01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:28.567
Oh. that's stunt lingo--

1501
01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:29.834
it's when you know

1502
01:00:29.967 --> 01:00:31.900
you're gonna be doing something
that might hurt.

1503
01:00:32.033 --> 01:00:33.266
- Ah.
- Kinda like

1504
01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:36.300
getting into shape after
eating junk food for a year.

1505
01:00:36.433 --> 01:00:37.633
Oh. that's it...

1506
01:00:37.767 --> 01:00:39.934
No mercy.

1507
01:00:40.066 --> 01:00:41.400
Okay...

1508
01:01:08.934 --> 01:01:10.467
You all right. Bruno?

1509
01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:13.567
Is that your best
"steely determination"?

1510
01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:15.233
Is that your best villain?

1511
01:01:15.367 --> 01:01:18.333
Rick. now you say--

1512
01:01:18.467 --> 01:01:21.300
"Enjoy your flight. Bruno."

1513
01:01:21.433 --> 01:01:23.700
Then Agent Hall
picks up Bruno Rifat.

1514
01:01:23.834 --> 01:01:27.500
throws him off the wing
for a high fall.

1515
01:01:27.633 --> 01:01:28.633
What's a "high fall"?

1516
01:01:28.767 --> 01:01:30.767
10.000 feet to the ground.

1517
01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:34.333
sending Bruno back
to his vacation home in Brazil.

1518
01:01:35.633 --> 01:01:37.233
You ready to fall?

1519
01:01:37.367 --> 01:01:39.200
I'm ready.

1520
01:01:39.333 --> 01:01:41.066
Ahh!

1521
01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:44.133
"Agent Hall turns to Nora

1522
01:01:44.266 --> 01:01:45.500
and says..."

1523
01:01:45.633 --> 01:01:47.567
I spy a beautiful woman.

1524
01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:49.667
Ahem. Uh. I know I'm not
an acting coach. Rick.

1525
01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:51.433
but that really
wasn't your best.

1526
01:01:51.567 --> 01:01:53.333
Again?

1527
01:01:53.467 --> 01:01:55.133
I kind of agree.

1528
01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:59.967
I spy a beautiful woman.

1529
01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:05.533
"Nora drops the knife.

1530
01:02:05.667 --> 01:02:09.066
completely powerless
to fight against his charm."

1531
01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.400
"Agent Hall

1532
01:02:10.533 --> 01:02:13.033
pulls Nora in
for a passionate kiss."

1533
01:02:13.166 --> 01:02:13.900
Whoa!

1534
01:02:14.033 --> 01:02:14.734
"But--

1535
01:02:14.867 --> 01:02:17.967
before their lips meet...

1536
01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:19.367
Bruno reappears with the knife!

1537
01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:20.767
He didn't fall!

1538
01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:23.600
He's been hanging
from the jet engine."

1539
01:02:23.734 --> 01:02:24.867
Chyah!

1540
01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:28.033
You just refuse to die.
don't you?

1541
01:02:28.166 --> 01:02:30.233
Ah. you know me.
I'm stubborn.

1542
01:02:33.867 --> 01:02:35.767
Okay. Let's take a break.

1543
01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:37.767
Uh. is there anything to eat
around here?

1544
01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:38.800
Avocado.

1545
01:02:38.934 --> 01:02:40.433
Ah! Okay.

1546
01:02:42.834 --> 01:02:45.266
You look like you're going
to Hogwarts or something.

1547
01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:46.734
Good job. Minnie.

1548
01:02:46.867 --> 01:02:47.834
Great reading!

1549
01:02:52.266 --> 01:02:54.467
That seagull
was not happy with me.

1550
01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:58.066
In fairness.
you were paddling on his ocean.

1551
01:02:58.200 --> 01:02:59.100
I don't know if I can take it

1552
01:02:59.233 --> 01:03:01.467
if both the gulls
and the owls gang up on me.

1553
01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:04.934
Mm. yeah. that would be
a "fowl" situation. for sure.

1554
01:03:05.066 --> 01:03:06.834
Did you just make a joke?

1555
01:03:06.967 --> 01:03:08.300
Mm. poor attempt?

1556
01:03:08.433 --> 01:03:09.867
Nah. it was pretty funny.

1557
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.033
Don't be so shocked.

1558
01:03:12.166 --> 01:03:14.200
You're starting to have fun
with me. aren't you?

1559
01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:19.500
Yes. Darian Hall has cracked
the code on Kate Wolfe.

1560
01:03:19.633 --> 01:03:21.467
I'm having fun.

1561
01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.433
It might be my best work yet.

1562
01:03:23.567 --> 01:03:24.934
And what about
saving the world?

1563
01:03:25.066 --> 01:03:27.000
Mm. it's overrated.

1564
01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:29.000
I have a new plan now.

1565
01:03:29.133 --> 01:03:30.567
And what's that?

1566
01:03:31.967 --> 01:03:33.967
Saving this place
with you.

1567
01:03:35.066 --> 01:03:37.967
And then you'll be gone
in no time.

1568
01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:40.467
Yeah. I guess I will.

1569
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.367
And. so. I am asking

1570
01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:55.433
the Silver Springs Town Council
to vote yes.

1571
01:03:55.567 --> 01:03:56.834
Good.

1572
01:03:56.967 --> 01:04:01.066
My grandfather. Samuel Wolfe.
was a champion of this town.

1573
01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.867
He would want his land
used in this way.

1574
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.333
A little more feeling.

1575
01:04:06.467 --> 01:04:08.433
Well. I'm not an actor
like you.

1576
01:04:08.567 --> 01:04:09.834
I'm not asking you to act.

1577
01:04:09.967 --> 01:04:11.734
I'm just asking you
to not work so hard

1578
01:04:11.867 --> 01:04:13.467
to disguise
how you really feel.

1579
01:04:14.567 --> 01:04:15.867
How do I do that?

1580
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.367
You're the queen of that.

1581
01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:19.633
You're harder to read
than anyone I've ever met.

1582
01:04:20.834 --> 01:04:22.166
I don't want
to be hard to read.

1583
01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:23.433
I know.

1584
01:04:23.567 --> 01:04:25.800
But you may need to practice.

1585
01:04:26.967 --> 01:04:28.600
Okay.

1586
01:04:28.734 --> 01:04:30.266
Ask me anything.

1587
01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:31.533
You sure?

1588
01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:33.467
'Cause this is a serious
violation of rule number one.

1589
01:04:35.867 --> 01:04:37.834
Hmm.

1590
01:04:37.967 --> 01:04:39.900
In yoga class.

1591
01:04:40.033 --> 01:04:43.333
when you visualize your life
in one year.

1592
01:04:43.467 --> 01:04:45.433
what do you see?

1593
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.200
I see the wellness retreat
doing well.

1594
01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:55.567
I see...

1595
01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:59.000
my grandpa's land
transformed into a camp

1596
01:04:59.133 --> 01:05:02.367
that families and kids
can come to in the summer.

1597
01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:07.500
And I want to make a difference
in people's lives.

1598
01:05:08.867 --> 01:05:11.100
Make my parents proud.

1599
01:05:12.633 --> 01:05:13.600
And me?

1600
01:05:16.066 --> 01:05:17.400
Am I there?

1601
01:05:18.467 --> 01:05:19.433
Rick.

1602
01:05:19.567 --> 01:05:22.333
When you close your eyes...

1603
01:05:22.467 --> 01:05:24.500
visualize your life
in one year.

1604
01:05:24.633 --> 01:05:26.934
am I there?

1605
01:05:27.066 --> 01:05:28.500
Because I see you.

1606
01:05:30.133 --> 01:05:31.400
You do?

1607
01:05:31.533 --> 01:05:34.333
You're the only thing I see
when I close my eyes these days.

1608
01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:36.500
What?

1609
01:05:36.633 --> 01:05:38.400
Try it. Close 'em.

1610
01:05:42.967 --> 01:05:44.467
Do you hear that?

1611
01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:47.133
The owl?
I don't...

1612
01:05:47.266 --> 01:05:48.767
No. not the owl.

1613
01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:50.567
The music.

1614
01:05:51.734 --> 01:05:53.233
I don't hear it.

1615
01:05:53.367 --> 01:05:54.867
Listen again.

1616
01:05:56.033 --> 01:05:57.266
You got brains.

1617
01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:59.000
you got brawn...

1618
01:05:59.133 --> 01:06:01.333
do you have rhythm?

1619
01:06:11.367 --> 01:06:13.700

1620
01:06:14.967 --> 01:06:17.767

Ahem!

1636
01:07:00.333 --> 01:07:02.066
There you are--

1637
01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:03.100
dancing off-rhythm.

1638
01:07:04.433 --> 01:07:05.467
- Hey.
- How you doin'?

1639
01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:07.900
So I think I managed
to do everything you asked.

1640
01:07:08.033 --> 01:07:09.934
Thanks. Jared.
Let's take a look.

1641
01:07:10.066 --> 01:07:11.867
What are those?

1642
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.200
Your sketches.

1643
01:07:13.333 --> 01:07:14.467
Everything you dreamed of.

1644
01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:17.467
These are fantastic.

1645
01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:18.567
Thank you.

1646
01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:20.266
Now I think we have

1647
01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:21.900
everything we need
to convince the council.

1648
01:07:22.033 --> 01:07:24.033
Well. how are you gonna explain
why you're here?

1649
01:07:24.166 --> 01:07:27.767
I thought I'd mention
this amazing woman I met in L.A.

1650
01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:30.834
and let their imaginations
run wild.

1651
01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:34.533
Okay!

1652
01:07:34.667 --> 01:07:36.100
I think my job here is done.

1653
01:07:36.233 --> 01:07:38.900
Gonna head back to the hotel
and catch up on some episodes.

1654
01:07:39.033 --> 01:07:40.400
So you got
everything you need.

1655
01:07:40.533 --> 01:07:42.700
- Good luck tomorrow. hey?
- Thanks.

1656
01:07:42.834 --> 01:07:43.700
Wanna walk me out?

1657
01:07:43.834 --> 01:07:46.133
Sure. Be right back.

1658
01:07:46.266 --> 01:07:47.467
Keep practicing those moves.

1659
01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:50.000
Oh. yeah. I will.

1660
01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:54.233
So it's parked
beside the cabin.

1661
01:07:54.367 --> 01:07:56.133
You're the best agent
I know.

1662
01:07:56.266 --> 01:07:57.834
Because I'm the best
there is. okay?

1663
01:07:58.834 --> 01:08:00.867
Not that I like
to rain on anyone's parade.

1664
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.767
but I can see how
this all ends.

1665
01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:05.166
You know.
between you and her?

1666
01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:07.934
We've been on that road before.
man-- it doesn't end well.

1667
01:08:08.066 --> 01:08:09.667
Let's just keep it
to the business affairs.

1668
01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:10.700
all right?

1669
01:08:11.633 --> 01:08:14.333
Fair enough. but...

1670
01:08:14.467 --> 01:08:16.000
you should know
that the studio's planning

1671
01:08:16.133 --> 01:08:17.000
to leak a story

1672
01:08:17.133 --> 01:08:18.500
about you and Liza
getting back together.

1673
01:08:18.633 --> 01:08:19.433
They what?

1674
01:08:19.567 --> 01:08:20.467
Publicity for the movie.

1675
01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:21.600
They wanna make it
a blockbuster.

1676
01:08:25.266 --> 01:08:27.200
You know how it is.

1677
01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:46.834
If successful.

1678
01:08:46.967 --> 01:08:49.000
I estimate
that it will bring

1679
01:08:49.133 --> 01:08:50.734
up to 2.000 tourists

1680
01:08:50.867 --> 01:08:52.133
in the next two years...

1681
01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:09.467
Wow.

1682
01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:11.533
Don't you dare say it--

1683
01:09:11.667 --> 01:09:13.734
I spy

1684
01:09:13.867 --> 01:09:15.367
a genuinely beautiful woman.

1685
01:09:17.233 --> 01:09:18.734
Your chariot.

1686
01:09:18.867 --> 01:09:20.867
Where did you get this car?

1687
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.233
Agent Darian Hall
travels in style.

1688
01:09:24.266 --> 01:09:25.533
And the way you look today.

1689
01:09:25.667 --> 01:09:27.233
maybe we should forget
the town hall meeting

1690
01:09:27.367 --> 01:09:30.300
and charter a flight to Paris
for a sunset dinner.

1691
01:09:30.433 --> 01:09:33.367
Ah. just like your movie
"A Death in Paris"?

1692
01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:34.867
Just like that.

1693
01:09:36.066 --> 01:09:36.767
I have a gift for you.

1694
01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:38.166
A gift?

1695
01:09:39.533 --> 01:09:41.400
Your very own chart.

1696
01:09:41.533 --> 01:09:42.700
My what?

1697
01:09:42.834 --> 01:09:44.967
I told you--
I was gonna keep a chart.

1698
01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:46.734
Everything I learned about you.

1699
01:09:49.333 --> 01:09:50.400
This...

1700
01:09:50.533 --> 01:09:52.600
is when I first learned
about your parents.

1701
01:09:52.734 --> 01:09:56.433
and how they were the reason
behind your tough exterior.

1702
01:09:56.567 --> 01:09:57.934
This day...

1703
01:09:58.066 --> 01:10:00.433
we talked about Ron and Tina
and their tree.

1704
01:10:00.567 --> 01:10:02.934
and I learned that you really
liked birdseed for breakfast.

1705
01:10:06.533 --> 01:10:07.900
And. uh. this is when

1706
01:10:08.033 --> 01:10:09.967
you finally shared
your dream with me.

1707
01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:12.633
and I learned how smart
and caring and invested you are

1708
01:10:12.767 --> 01:10:14.400
in the lives of others.

1709
01:10:14.533 --> 01:10:17.934
This is when you cheered
as I reached my goal.

1710
01:10:18.066 --> 01:10:20.400
and I learned
that you could be truly happy

1711
01:10:20.533 --> 01:10:22.066
for someone else.

1712
01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:25.900
Read what it says for today.

1713
01:10:26.033 --> 01:10:28.900
"Kate kills it
at the town hall meeting."

1714
01:10:29.033 --> 01:10:31.100
After everything
I've learned about you.

1715
01:10:31.233 --> 01:10:33.000
I know exactly
how today will go.

1716
01:10:34.066 --> 01:10:35.367
Now let's go do this.

1717
01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:37.367
Okay.

1718
01:10:40.433 --> 01:10:42.400
Thank you. monsieur.

1719
01:10:42.533 --> 01:10:44.533
You're welcome. madame.

1720
01:10:48.567 --> 01:10:50.633
Oh. ho!

1721
01:10:50.767 --> 01:10:53.400
Darian Hall. okay!

1722
01:10:53.533 --> 01:10:54.767
Let's go...

1723
01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:56.700
to the town hall meeting.

1724
01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.600
Whoo!

1725
01:11:02.066 --> 01:11:04.000
And the faces
of the council members

1726
01:11:04.133 --> 01:11:05.333
when Rick walked in--

1727
01:11:05.467 --> 01:11:07.600
well. they were positively
star-struck.

1728
01:11:07.734 --> 01:11:09.467
and Rick never said a word!

1729
01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:11.200
What happened next?

1730
01:11:11.333 --> 01:11:13.800
Kate gave
a fabulous presentation--

1731
01:11:13.934 --> 01:11:15.967
so detailed and thorough.

1732
01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:18.633
I have no idea
how they can deny her request.

1733
01:11:18.767 --> 01:11:20.100
But...

1734
01:11:20.233 --> 01:11:22.667
the final vote
is scheduled for Friday.

1735
01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:24.233
Mm-hmm.

1736
01:11:25.367 --> 01:11:27.700
And when you countered
with the exact budget numbers?

1737
01:11:27.834 --> 01:11:29.600
Whoo! You are a force
to be reckoned with.

1738
01:11:29.734 --> 01:11:30.867
Did you see their faces

1739
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.633
when they saw
Agent Darian Hall show up?

1740
01:11:33.767 --> 01:11:34.867
It had nothing to do with me.

1741
01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.533
You were so impressive today.

1742
01:11:39.633 --> 01:11:41.367
There you are.

1743
01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:42.867
Hi. Kate.

1744
01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.166
Liza.

1745
01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:46.467
You look incredible.

1746
01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:48.533
So do you.

1747
01:11:49.533 --> 01:11:50.867
What are you doing
in my cabin?

1748
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.433
Waiting for you?

1749
01:11:52.567 --> 01:11:53.867
Okay.

1750
01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.600
Uh. thanks again. Rick.
for today.

1751
01:11:57.734 --> 01:11:58.700
There's a Pilates class

1752
01:11:58.834 --> 01:12:00.734
I said I would teach
this afternoon. so. um.

1753
01:12:00.867 --> 01:12:02.567
I'm gonna go do that.

1754
01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:03.767
- Oh--
- See you later.

1755
01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:05.166
Okay.

1756
01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:06.567
- Bye.
- Bye.

1757
01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:08.667
So. you ready?

1758
01:12:09.633 --> 01:12:10.567
Ready for what?

1759
01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:12.333
Publicity?

1760
01:12:12.467 --> 01:12:14.867
The team flew in
over an hour ago.

1761
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.600
The stylist has your outfit
laid out in there.

1762
01:12:17.734 --> 01:12:19.033
Right. That's today. Okay.

1763
01:12:19.166 --> 01:12:21.166
Sun's setting. Hurry up.

1764
01:12:22.333 --> 01:12:26.100
Oh. and the car's
a nice touch. Agent Hall.

1765
01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:29.266
Yeah.

1766
01:12:37.367 --> 01:12:38.767
Hey. Jared.

1767
01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:40.767
- Hey!
- Whatcha up to?

1768
01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:42.667
Uh. Rick and Liza's
photo shoot--

1769
01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:43.767
just watching a live feed--

1770
01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:46.333
the quintessential
Hollywood power couple.

1771
01:12:46.467 --> 01:12:47.500
Look at this. look at this.

1772
01:12:47.633 --> 01:12:48.600
See that?

1773
01:12:48.734 --> 01:12:50.333
Pure passion in her eyes.

1774
01:12:50.467 --> 01:12:52.433
Just like old times.

1775
01:12:55.166 --> 01:12:59.400
Okay. I'm gonna need you two
to get a little closer.

1776
01:13:01.066 --> 01:13:04.300
Okay. Rick I need you
to look at Liza with love--

1777
01:13:04.433 --> 01:13:06.033
Agent Hall and Nora.

1778
01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:10.834
Feels like old times.

1779
01:13:11.867 --> 01:13:14.000
Um. some smiles. please?

1780
01:13:14.133 --> 01:13:16.533
Smiles?

1781
01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:19.033
I'm sorry. Rick.

1782
01:13:19.166 --> 01:13:20.567
for what happened.

1783
01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:22.734
I really am.

1784
01:13:22.867 --> 01:13:25.834
I need you to know
that I know it was a mistake.

1785
01:13:25.967 --> 01:13:27.900
A mistake?

1786
01:13:28.033 --> 01:13:30.166
You and I. we were good.

1787
01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:32.300
We were really good.

1788
01:13:32.433 --> 01:13:34.333
So good. you cheated.

1789
01:13:34.467 --> 01:13:36.266
Rick. can you
get a little closer to her?

1790
01:13:38.533 --> 01:13:40.967
It happens. Rick.

1791
01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:42.967
It was a mistake.

1792
01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:44.800
Doing that to you--

1793
01:13:44.934 --> 01:13:46.900
breaking your heart--

1794
01:13:47.033 --> 01:13:49.633
it's the biggest regret
of my life.

1795
01:13:49.767 --> 01:13:50.800
Really?

1796
01:13:50.934 --> 01:13:52.900
Can you put your hand
on his cheek?

1797
01:13:54.233 --> 01:13:56.500
I think we should try again.

1798
01:13:56.633 --> 01:13:58.033
Try again?

1799
01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:01.500
Okay. I'm gonna need you two
to kiss.

1800
01:14:01.633 --> 01:14:03.500
Uh. this card's almost full.

1801
01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:08.400
I'm gonna need a new card.

1802
01:14:08.533 --> 01:14:10.300
That was the last shot.

1803
01:14:10.433 --> 01:14:12.600
Liza?

1804
01:14:12.734 --> 01:14:14.767
I think we need to talk.

1805
01:14:18.767 --> 01:14:21.667
So. what were they like
as a couple?

1806
01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:23.000
Rick and Liza?

1807
01:14:23.133 --> 01:14:24.200
Mm-hmm.

1808
01:14:24.333 --> 01:14:26.233
Uh. they were good.

1809
01:14:26.367 --> 01:14:28.333
I mean. Rick thought
she was the one.

1810
01:14:28.467 --> 01:14:29.333
Hmm.

1811
01:14:29.467 --> 01:14:30.500
But when she broke his heart.

1812
01:14:30.633 --> 01:14:32.233
it really--
it really hurt him.

1813
01:14:32.367 --> 01:14:33.166
You know?

1814
01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:34.367
But now that I look back.

1815
01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:36.400
I actually think
it was for the better.

1816
01:14:36.533 --> 01:14:39.367
You know. sure. he went through
a little depression phase.

1817
01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:41.633
but I think Liza taught him
what he doesn't want in life.

1818
01:14:41.767 --> 01:14:42.967
you know?

1819
01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:45.166
Showed him the core values
in a woman that he does want.

1820
01:14:47.166 --> 01:14:49.333
But... this is Hollywood!

1821
01:14:49.467 --> 01:14:52.166
And as much as I'd like
to tell you anything different.

1822
01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:53.467
whew. Liza Cahoone.

1823
01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:56.367
she usually gets what she wants.
you know what I'm saying?

1824
01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:57.834
Yeah.

1825
01:15:01.233 --> 01:15:02.767
Oh. it's Sasha.
your best friend.

1826
01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:04.200
She's actually really cute.

1827
01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:06.233
- Yeah!
- Yeah. She made dinner.

1828
01:15:06.367 --> 01:15:07.433
- Oh?
- Gotta go!

1829
01:15:07.567 --> 01:15:08.867
- Uh. sorry.
- Yeah. okay.

1830
01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Sorry about that.

1831
01:15:41.367 --> 01:15:42.300
Rick?

1832
01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:45.300
Rick. open the door.

1833
01:15:48.033 --> 01:15:49.300
Kate?

1834
01:15:49.433 --> 01:15:51.100
Look. I know
your training is over.

1835
01:15:51.233 --> 01:15:53.533
but I want to talk to you--
can you put your sneakers on?

1836
01:15:53.667 --> 01:15:54.533
What time is it?

1837
01:15:54.667 --> 01:15:56.266
Come on. Just get dressed.

1838
01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:58.066
We're gonna go for a run.

1839
01:15:58.200 --> 01:15:59.600
It's a little early.
isn't it?

1840
01:15:59.734 --> 01:16:01.467
Even for you.

1841
01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:07.033
Yeah... you don't
want to come in here.

1842
01:16:07.166 --> 01:16:08.500
Oh.

1843
01:16:08.633 --> 01:16:09.800
Can you just wait here
a minute?

1844
01:16:09.934 --> 01:16:10.867
I'll go get my sneakers.

1845
01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:20.900
Aw. man. you could've at least
lit a match!

1846
01:16:22.133 --> 01:16:24.100
Oh.

1847
01:16:25.133 --> 01:16:25.967
Hello?

1848
01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:28.700
Yeah. He's right here.

1849
01:16:28.834 --> 01:16:30.266
What?

1850
01:16:31.467 --> 01:16:33.166
No. Y-- I-I understand.

1851
01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:34.567
What did you say to Liza?

1852
01:16:36.633 --> 01:16:37.633
It's outsi--

1853
01:16:37.767 --> 01:16:39.767
Yeah. it just pulled up.

1854
01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:42.133
We can be at the airport
in. like. 30 minutes.

1855
01:16:42.266 --> 01:16:43.667
Yeah.

1856
01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:44.800
Pack your stuff.

1857
01:16:44.934 --> 01:16:47.600
Yeah. Of course.
Whatever you need us to do.

1858
01:16:47.734 --> 01:16:49.834
Thanks for letting me know.

1859
01:16:49.967 --> 01:16:51.667
Liza just quit the movie!

1860
01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:52.934
Why would she quit the movie?

1861
01:16:53.066 --> 01:16:55.333
I just told her we weren't
getting back together.

1862
01:16:55.467 --> 01:16:56.333
Ever.

1863
01:16:56.467 --> 01:16:57.834
"Ever?" Oh!

1864
01:16:57.967 --> 01:16:59.066
Get in the car.

1865
01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:00.700
They need you to screen test

1866
01:17:00.834 --> 01:17:02.367
with the possible Noras
right now.

1867
01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:05.900
Geez! This is gonna
delay shooting. you know?

1868
01:17:06.033 --> 01:17:07.033
That was not my intention.

1869
01:17:07.166 --> 01:17:09.200
Hey. You know
I'm grateful for the work.

1870
01:17:09.333 --> 01:17:11.100
Well. let's hope the studio
sees it that way. okay?

1871
01:17:11.233 --> 01:17:12.767
I got a lot of damage control
to do. Rick.

1872
01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:14.700
But I'm also a real person.

1873
01:17:14.834 --> 01:17:17.533
and I need
to talk to Kate before we go.

1874
01:17:17.667 --> 01:17:18.834
Okay?

1875
01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:23.667
I did not grow up in the woods
to be scared by owls.

1876
01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:24.734
Yeah.

1877
01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:26.734
What?

1878
01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:34.100
Kate!

1879
01:17:35.834 --> 01:17:37.066
Kate. you in there?

1880
01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:38.300
I need to talk to you!

1881
01:17:38.433 --> 01:17:41.200
- Hey. let's go!
- I'm not quite ready. Jared!

1882
01:17:41.333 --> 01:17:42.934
Yes. you are!
Get in the car!

1883
01:17:44.233 --> 01:17:45.100
Jared.

1884
01:17:45.233 --> 01:17:46.900
Come on. man.

1885
01:17:47.033 --> 01:17:49.200
Look. I get it.

1886
01:17:49.333 --> 01:17:50.867
You like it here. okay?

1887
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.233
Yeah.

1888
01:17:52.367 --> 01:17:53.266
And I can see it in your eyes.
you have a thing for Kate.

1889
01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:56.166
I kinda have a thing for Sasha.

1890
01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:57.400
But we gotta go.

1891
01:17:57.533 --> 01:17:59.066
Bot of our careers
are on the line. okay?

1892
01:18:01.934 --> 01:18:04.867
Why'd you make me eat two whole
pizzas by myself last night?

1893
01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.300
You trying to kill me?

1894
01:18:07.467 --> 01:18:08.567
We gotta go.

1895
01:18:10.533 --> 01:18:11.834
Now!

1896
01:18:37.233 --> 01:18:39.500
Are you okay?

1897
01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:42.367
I'm fun...

1898
01:18:43.967 --> 01:18:45.133
I know how to have fun...

1899
01:18:45.266 --> 01:18:48.166
...and let my walls down.

1900
01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:49.567
You're lots of fun.

1901
01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:50.867
Yeah.

1902
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.400
Lots of fun.

1903
01:18:52.533 --> 01:18:54.266
And-And you got pizza.

1904
01:18:55.467 --> 01:18:56.934
It's cauliflower crust.

1905
01:18:57.066 --> 01:18:58.233
Yeah.

1906
01:18:58.367 --> 01:19:00.867
See?

1907
01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.867
I don't even know
how to have fun!

1908
01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.433
I can't even eat
a regular slice of pizza.

1909
01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:10.000
I have two things to tell you.

1910
01:19:10.133 --> 01:19:11.133
One's good...

1911
01:19:12.233 --> 01:19:13.500
...one's not so good.

1912
01:19:14.633 --> 01:19:16.700
I hate to add insult to injury.

1913
01:19:16.834 --> 01:19:19.200
Just rip the Band-aid off.

1914
01:19:19.333 --> 01:19:20.834
You've been fired.

1915
01:19:21.967 --> 01:19:23.633
By the studio.

1916
01:19:23.767 --> 01:19:24.967
What?

1917
01:19:26.066 --> 01:19:28.233
But there was one day left
in my contract

1918
01:19:28.367 --> 01:19:30.000
and the client
just up and left!

1919
01:19:30.133 --> 01:19:32.200
He didn't even say goodbye.

1920
01:19:32.333 --> 01:19:33.533
I know.

1921
01:19:33.667 --> 01:19:36.066
And they paid in full.

1922
01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:38.233
but the studio rep
on the phone

1923
01:19:38.367 --> 01:19:39.967
insisted I tell you
that you're fired.

1924
01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.667
I wanted to give you--

1925
01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:45.233
I wanted to give you this.

1926
01:19:58.667 --> 01:20:00.834
Sasha.

1927
01:20:00.967 --> 01:20:02.700
All you have to do is sign.

1928
01:20:02.834 --> 01:20:04.166
Full partners.

1929
01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:07.900
No matter what happens with
the town council or the land.

1930
01:20:08.033 --> 01:20:10.066
this retreat needs you.

1931
01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:12.133
I need you.

1932
01:20:14.033 --> 01:20:15.867
So. what do you say?

1933
01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.533
We can turn this place
into the Hollywood hideaway

1934
01:20:18.667 --> 01:20:21.767
for out-of-shape stars
in the off-season...

1935
01:20:23.233 --> 01:20:25.934
...and a camp for the kids
in the summer.

1936
01:20:29.567 --> 01:20:32.567
Is this because you think
I can't win the town over?

1937
01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:34.066
No! No. no. no.

1938
01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:36.567
I have a good feeling
about that.

1939
01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:38.967
This is just in case
you don't.

1940
01:20:40.166 --> 01:20:41.367
Come here.

1941
01:20:43.767 --> 01:20:45.533
This time tomorrow.

1942
01:20:45.667 --> 01:20:48.233
we are going to be celebrating
by the campfire.

1943
01:20:48.367 --> 01:20:49.667
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

1944
01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:51.667
I know it.
Let's focus on that.

1945
01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:53.367
Yeah!

1946
01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:55.333
Let's focus on that.

1947
01:20:55.467 --> 01:20:56.900
Men schmen...

1948
01:20:57.033 --> 01:20:59.734
even ones like Rick Steele.

1949
01:20:59.867 --> 01:21:01.934
Thanks.

1950
01:21:08.667 --> 01:21:11.133
Keep those arms moving!

1951
01:21:11.266 --> 01:21:14.266
Let's focus
on a full-body workout!

1952
01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:16.166
And remember.
if you get tired.

1953
01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:18.700
it's better
to slow down your pace

1954
01:21:18.834 --> 01:21:20.734
than come
to a complete stop!

1955
01:21:20.867 --> 01:21:23.133
Let's go. team!

1956
01:21:23.266 --> 01:21:24.467
Yeah! You got this!

1957
01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:26.066
Whoo!

1958
01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:30.500
Okay. I said not to come
to a complete stop. but...

1959
01:21:31.934 --> 01:21:33.600
- Hello?
- No cell phones. Min--

1960
01:21:33.734 --> 01:21:34.867
- Uh-huh.
- Remember?

1961
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.934
Oh. O-Okay. yes.
I'll-I'll tell her.

1962
01:21:38.066 --> 01:21:40.066
- Minnie.
- Thank you. sweetheart.

1963
01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:43.066
That was my son--
the Mayor.

1964
01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:45.834
The council voted
in your favor!

1965
01:21:45.967 --> 01:21:47.100
Really?

1966
01:21:47.233 --> 01:21:49.700
Yes!

1967
01:21:49.834 --> 01:21:51.133
Congratulations!

1968
01:21:51.266 --> 01:21:53.233
Oh. my gosh.
I can't believe it!

1969
01:21:53.367 --> 01:21:54.600
Thank you.

1970
01:21:54.734 --> 01:21:55.734
Well done!

1971
01:21:55.867 --> 01:21:59.233
Alright. let's celebrate
by continuing running.

1972
01:21:59.367 --> 01:22:02.233
All right. everyone!
Let's pick up the pace!

1973
01:22:18.934 --> 01:22:19.934
What...?

1974
01:22:20.066 --> 01:22:20.900
Hi.

1975
01:22:21.033 --> 01:22:23.000
Hello.

1976
01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:25.967
I thought you were in L.A.

1977
01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:27.433
I. uh. should be.
but. uh...

1978
01:22:27.567 --> 01:22:30.166
I realized I was able to get
some work done here before

1979
01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:32.433
and emails seem to work fine
nowadays. so.

1980
01:22:32.567 --> 01:22:35.400
That sounds fantastic.

1981
01:22:36.934 --> 01:22:38.000
No driver this time?

1982
01:22:38.133 --> 01:22:39.700
It's just me.

1983
01:22:40.734 --> 01:22:42.767
So... where we goin'?

1984
01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:44.100
Oh. now?

1985
01:22:48.033 --> 01:22:49.300
After you. milady.

1986
01:23:02.834 --> 01:23:04.667
This seat taken?

1987
01:23:07.033 --> 01:23:08.266
Rick?

1988
01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:10.033
What are you doing here?

1989
01:23:10.166 --> 01:23:11.100
What am I doing here?

1990
01:23:11.233 --> 01:23:12.266
What are you doing here?

1991
01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:13.834
The campfire's gonna start soon.

1992
01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:17.000
Seriously.
what are you doing here?

1993
01:23:17.133 --> 01:23:19.767
I hear the council voted
to change the zoning.

1994
01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:21.367
Yeah. they did.

1995
01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:23.166
How do you know that?

1996
01:23:23.300 --> 01:23:24.433
Spy.

1997
01:23:27.266 --> 01:23:29.166
So I guess you got
a lot of work ahead.

1998
01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:31.166
Setting up the camp for kids.

1999
01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:33.600
renovating
your grandpa's house.

2000
01:23:33.734 --> 01:23:35.834
Yeah.

2001
01:23:35.967 --> 01:23:38.166
How would you feel
if I helped?

2002
01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:39.900
What do you mean?

2003
01:23:41.166 --> 01:23:43.700
I've learned
something recently. Kate.

2004
01:23:43.834 --> 01:23:46.133
My work is my work...

2005
01:23:46.266 --> 01:23:49.500
but my real life
is a completely separate thing.

2006
01:23:50.834 --> 01:23:52.667
What about the movie
you have to shoot?

2007
01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:54.700
Shooting's been delayed.

2008
01:23:54.834 --> 01:23:56.433
The studio's trying to find
a new co-star.

2009
01:23:56.567 --> 01:23:57.500
For Liza?

2010
01:23:57.633 --> 01:23:58.400
Mm-hmm.

2011
01:23:58.533 --> 01:24:00.233
You and her--?

2012
01:24:00.367 --> 01:24:01.166
Are done.

2013
01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:03.266
We've been done
for a while now.

2014
01:24:04.333 --> 01:24:05.834
Plain and simple...

2015
01:24:05.967 --> 01:24:08.133
Liza's not the one for me.

2016
01:24:08.266 --> 01:24:10.633
But... the cabin.

2017
01:24:10.767 --> 01:24:13.400
That morning.
I thought you and her--

2018
01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:15.133
No!

2019
01:24:15.266 --> 01:24:17.467
That was Jared in the cabin.

2020
01:24:18.633 --> 01:24:20.433
He had a pizza hangover.

2021
01:24:24.867 --> 01:24:27.166
And now that you've been
fired by the studio...

2022
01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:29.133
Did you do that?

2023
01:24:29.266 --> 01:24:31.734
I know how seriously
you take your rules.

2024
01:24:31.867 --> 01:24:33.166
so I asked them
to put that contract

2025
01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:34.433
through the shredder.

2026
01:24:34.567 --> 01:24:36.467
We are officially

2027
01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:38.100
no longer client
and coach.

2028
01:24:39.767 --> 01:24:41.467
So. uh...

2029
01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:43.333
what does that make you and I?

2030
01:24:44.767 --> 01:24:47.834
Well. I've been asking myself
that same question.

2031
01:24:47.967 --> 01:24:50.800
Whatever we are.

2032
01:24:50.934 --> 01:24:53.734
it's definitely not something
I want to let pass me by.

2033
01:24:55.767 --> 01:24:57.767
I spy a beautiful life
with you. Kate.

2034
01:24:58.867 --> 01:25:00.533
That was really cheesy.

2035
01:25:00.667 --> 01:25:02.900
Well. I like cheesy.

2036
01:25:03.934 --> 01:25:06.967
