1
00:04:01.478 --> 00:04:02.834
My name is Alice.

2
00:04:03.668 --> 00:04:06.379
I worked for the Umbrella Corporation.
in a secret laboratory

3
00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.882
developing eperimental bio weponary

4
00:04:09.612 --> 00:04:12.323
There was an incident. a virus escaped.

5
00:04:12.636 --> 00:04:13.887
Everybody died.

6
00:04:15.556 --> 00:04:16.911
trouble was...

7
00:04:17.745 --> 00:04:19.205
There didn't stay dead.

8
00:04:20.248 --> 00:04:23.585
This was the start of an apocalypse
that whould sweep the entire world

9
00:04:24.002 --> 00:04:27.026
The men responsible for this disaster took
refuge underground

10
00:04:27.547 --> 00:04:30.154
And continued to experiment
with the deadly T-Virus.

11
00:04:30.988 --> 00:04:33.178
They felt secure in their high tech fortress.

12
00:04:34.742 --> 00:04:36.098
But they were wrong.

13
00:05:01.437 --> 00:05:02.479
Bio hazard.
(Speaking Japanese...)

14
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:35.493
Mr General?

15
00:06:36.431 --> 00:06:37.891
- Report.
- Sir.

16
00:06:38.413 --> 00:06:42.062
A half hour ago we began
lose contact with parameter sentries.

17
00:06:42.897 --> 00:06:44.148
How many have we lost?

18
00:06:44.773 --> 00:06:48.423
- All of them.
- And you waited 30 minutes to tell me?

19
00:06:48.632 --> 00:06:51.968
We thought it was a communications problem.
I didn't want to disturb you.

20
00:06:52.594 --> 00:06:54.158
Give me the surface gate.
Hai!

21
00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:01.249
- This is General Wesker.
- Sir.

22
00:07:01.562 --> 00:07:04.273
- Report your situation.
- Everything is quiet here.

23
00:07:04.586 --> 00:07:05.941
No sign of intruders?

24
00:07:08.235 --> 00:07:10.321
Hotaka...we have movement!
Multiples targets

25
00:07:14.075 --> 00:07:15.952
Surface gate.
Identify targets.

26
00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:18.142
repeat...identify targets.

27
00:07:18.246 --> 00:07:22.417
- Sir. elevator 2 is moving.
- I want security at that main entrance now!

28
00:10:00.081 --> 00:10:01.332
Hey. boys...

29
00:10:02.792 --> 00:10:05.191
Is that any way to treat a lady?

30
00:10:20.832 --> 00:10:24.064
Tell security to flood the main entrance
with Nano-Gas.

31
00:10:26.046 --> 00:10:27.088
Sir...?

32
00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:29.070
Our men are still out there!

33
00:10:33.971 --> 00:10:35.430
Any more questions?

34
00:10:37.307 --> 00:10:40.644
Intruders in sectors 1 thru 5
7 and 8.

35
00:10:40.644 --> 00:10:43.147
Reports of gun fire in
sectors 10 and 11.

36
00:10:46.588 --> 00:10:47.943
Stay at your stations!

37
00:10:48.673 --> 00:10:51.280
All security protocols
are now in full effect.

38
00:10:51.593 --> 00:10:55.243
Lock down all elevators
Seal all internal blast doors

39
00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.371
And I want damage reports.

40
00:13:09.028 --> 00:13:11.531
<i> Intruder Alert </i>

Turbulence. Turb...

47
00:15:27.401 --> 00:15:28.653
Any last words?

48
00:15:42.208 --> 00:15:44.607
How nice to finally
meet the real you.

49
00:15:46.692 --> 00:15:47.943
Hurts...doesn't it?

50
00:15:48.673 --> 00:15:51.176
Well. it's just the start
of the bad news.

51
00:15:51.906 --> 00:15:53.574
All those powers of your's...

52
00:15:54.096 --> 00:15:56.494
Speed ...Strength...

53
00:15:56.807 --> 00:16:00.456
Accelerated healing...
Well. you can kiss all those goodbye.

54
00:16:01.812 --> 00:16:04.002
- What have you done?
- The Serum I've injected you with

55
00:16:04.002 --> 00:16:06.817
is neutralizing the T-cells with in your body.

56
00:16:07.443 --> 00:16:12.344
Put simply...The Umbrella Corporation
is taking back it's property.

57
00:16:13.595 --> 00:16:15.159
You just didn't work out.

58
00:16:15.889 --> 00:16:17.141
So. you are being withdrawn

59
00:16:32.886 --> 00:16:36.536
I am what you used to be...
Only better.

60
00:16:37.161 --> 00:16:38.308
Please wait.

61
00:16:38.726 --> 00:16:39.873
Last words?

62
00:16:41.437 --> 00:16:43.731
- Thank you.
- For killing you?

63
00:16:44.878 --> 00:16:46.755
For making me human again.

64
00:16:49.362 --> 00:16:52.490
(Computer Voice)
Pull up...Terrian...Terrian... Pull up...Terrian...Terrian...

65
00:17:59.122 --> 00:18:02.041
This is Arcadia. broadcasting on
the emergency frequency.

66
00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:06.421
There is no infection. We offer safety
and security...food and shelter.

67
00:18:09.028 --> 00:18:11.843
This is Arcadia. broadcasting on
the emergency frequency.

68
00:18:12.156 --> 00:18:13.407
There is no infection...

69
00:18:15.389 --> 00:18:17.057
Well I took revenge on Umbrella.

70
00:18:17.474 --> 00:18:19.977
The last handful of survivors
took a chopper to safety.

71
00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:23.418
They were Headed for a town in
Alaska called Arcadia.

72
00:18:24.565 --> 00:18:26.546
We had received radio transmissions from there

73
00:18:27.068 --> 00:18:29.779
They offered food and shelter.
safety and security ...

74
00:18:30.196 --> 00:18:31.134
A Haven.

75
00:18:31.656 --> 00:18:32.907
Free of infection.

76
00:18:47.297 --> 00:18:49.487
May 3. 16:00 hours

77
00:18:50.112 --> 00:18:52.511
177 days without signs of life.

78
00:18:53.971 --> 00:18:55.013
I'm at. uh...

79
00:18:55.326 --> 00:19:00.436
58.37 degrees North. 134.58 degrees West.

80
00:19:01.478 --> 00:19:03.668
Closing on coordinates
for Arcadia

81
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:05.962
But no signs appear on any map.

82
00:19:08.465 --> 00:19:10.029
I hope Claire & the others made it.

83
00:21:40.081 --> 00:21:41.541
You're not coming?

84
00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:43.626
Take care of the others.

85
00:21:44.461 --> 00:21:45.816
Good luck. K-Mart.

86
00:21:48.215 --> 00:21:49.257
Claire...

87
00:22:25.441 --> 00:22:26.379
May 3

88
00:22:27.005 --> 00:22:28.361
19:30 hours

89
00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:30.238
Arcadia.

90
00:22:31.176 --> 00:22:33.261
If such a place exists.

91
00:22:33.991 --> 00:22:35.556
Just an empty field...

92
00:22:36.807 --> 00:22:37.954
And a beach.

93
00:22:41.082 --> 00:22:42.751
We all heard the transmissions.

94
00:22:43.585 --> 00:22:45.149
Someone must've sent them.

95
00:22:45.879 --> 00:22:47.234
Someone must have...

96
00:22:47.756 --> 00:22:49.633
Why aren't all these people here?

97
00:22:51.822 --> 00:22:53.074
Or why...

98
00:22:54.742 --> 00:22:56.098
Where they go?

99
00:23:01.416 --> 00:23:03.293
Day 177 signing off.

100
00:23:08.194 --> 00:23:10.175
I don't know if I can do this much longer.

101
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:15.597
I am the last one...or is there no one else?

102
00:23:17.891 --> 00:23:19.768
Anyone who watches this tape...

103
00:23:22.584 --> 00:23:24.044
Is this my punishment?

104
00:23:24.982 --> 00:23:26.755
To know that all this happened?

105
00:23:30.196 --> 00:23:32.073
Hey! Wait!

106
00:23:36.557 --> 00:23:38.538
Wait! Please! Stop!

107
00:23:43.439 --> 00:23:44.586
Hello?

108
00:23:47.088 --> 00:23:48.131
Hello...?

109
00:23:50.425 --> 00:23:51.677
Answer me!

110
00:25:39.393 --> 00:25:40.436
Hey. Hey!

111
00:25:41.687 --> 00:25:42.834
It's okay.

112
00:25:45.754 --> 00:25:47.318
Sorry about that.

113
00:25:48.152 --> 00:25:51.906
But I had to get this thing
off for you. What is this?

114
00:25:52.219 --> 00:25:53.679
Who did this to you?

115
00:25:57.745 --> 00:25:59.414
Do you know who I am?

116
00:26:04.002 --> 00:26:06.087
My name is Alice.

117
00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:09.633
We met in the Nevada desert
18 months ago.

118
00:26:09.633 --> 00:26:11.197
Any of this sound familiar?

119
00:26:13.178 --> 00:26:15.889
Mikey. Carlos. L.J. ...

120
00:26:16.411 --> 00:26:17.453
K-Mart.

121
00:26:19.539 --> 00:26:22.980
You left in a helicopter with a
group of survivors headed for Alaska.

122
00:26:24.648 --> 00:26:26.212
Arcadia. remember?

123
00:26:33.407 --> 00:26:35.284
<i> Arcadia. remember? </ i></i>

124
00:26:37.578 --> 00:26:39.143
<i> Arcadia. remember? </ i></i>

125
00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.150
May 4...08:00 hours

126
00:27:06.463 --> 00:27:09.174
Plotted a course to Prince
Rupert and British Columbia.

127
00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.824
I'll pass Vancouver.
Drop down in Seattle

128
00:27:12.824 --> 00:27:14.805
After that its San Francisco...

129
00:27:15.848 --> 00:27:17.724
And the rest of the West Coast.

130
00:27:23.043 --> 00:27:25.754
My passengers is still
talkative as ever.

131
00:27:28.048 --> 00:27:31.802
Whatever that thing was
it was injecting her with some sort of drug.

132
00:27:32.427 --> 00:27:34.304
Something that causes memory loss.

133
00:27:36.911 --> 00:27:38.788
I just hope the effects aren't permanent.

134
00:27:54.534 --> 00:27:55.576
Your name...?

135
00:27:57.349 --> 00:27:58.705
Is Alice right...?

136
00:27:59.956 --> 00:28:01.312
You shouldn't speak.

137
00:28:02.771 --> 00:28:04.440
Look. I'm sorry about back there.

138
00:28:06.525 --> 00:28:07.985
I don't...I don't know what happened.

139
00:28:10.905 --> 00:28:12.469
I don't remember anything.

140
00:28:15.284 --> 00:28:16.849
I don't even know my name.

141
00:28:18.308 --> 00:28:19.560
It's Claire.

142
00:28:21.854 --> 00:28:23.835
Claire Redfield.

143
00:28:24.982 --> 00:28:26.129
Claire.

144
00:28:26.859 --> 00:28:28.006
Sound familiar?

145
00:28:30.717 --> 00:28:31.864
Not really.

146
00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:34.680
You'll get used to it.

147
00:28:38.329 --> 00:28:40.102
Perhaps you can cut me loose now.

148
00:28:40.936 --> 00:28:43.126
We should get know each
other a little better first.

149
00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:18.684
City of Angels ...

150
00:29:24.523 --> 00:29:26.400
May 6th at 18:00 hours

151
00:29:26.609 --> 00:29:27.964
Los Angeles.

152
00:29:28.799 --> 00:29:30.258
No signs of life.

153
00:29:31.822 --> 00:29:33.282
Not even the undead.

154
00:29:35.368 --> 00:29:37.141
Someone must have cleaned up the city.

155
00:29:38.392 --> 00:29:39.852
But what about the rest?

156
00:29:56.327 --> 00:29:57.474
Oh! My God.

157
00:29:58.413 --> 00:29:59.455
What?

158
00:29:59.873 --> 00:30:01.020
Look over there.

159
00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:12.281
Damn.

160
00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.591
It's a plane. It's a plane!

161
00:30:31.155 --> 00:30:32.198
I knew it!

162
00:30:32.198 --> 00:30:33.658
<i> Help Us. </ i></i>

163
00:30:33.866 --> 00:30:37.307
- I told you they will come.
- Hey! We're down here! Hello!

164
00:31:11.093 --> 00:31:12.865
No way we're gettin' in there.

165
00:31:18.913 --> 00:31:21.937
Where is going? Why is it flying away?

166
00:31:22.354 --> 00:31:23.606
It's not flying away.

167
00:31:24.336 --> 00:31:25.900
- circling...
- "circling"

168
00:31:28.507 --> 00:31:29.862
Damn. he's low.

169
00:31:35.493 --> 00:31:37.161
What the hell is he doin'?

170
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:44.356
- he's gonna land.
- he's gonna land!

171
00:31:44.356 --> 00:31:46.129
Get over there...out of the away!
Quick! Go!

172
00:31:46.129 --> 00:31:48.632
- Land?
- Yeah...land!

173
00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:52.177
That is one crazy son of a bitch.

174
00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:55.514
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

175
00:31:56.765 --> 00:31:58.016
Then cut me loose.

176
00:32:06.984 --> 00:32:10.112
- Thanks.
- Just don't try anything crazy. alright?

177
00:32:11.989 --> 00:32:13.971
Nothing as crazy as
what you have in mind.

178
00:32:23.981 --> 00:32:26.066
- Come on! Keep moving!
- I'm trying.

179
00:32:36.181 --> 00:32:37.433
All right. hold on.

180
00:32:40.978 --> 00:32:42.125
Hey. help me!

181
00:32:47.651 --> 00:32:48.799
Come on.

182
00:33:26.546 --> 00:33:27.797
No!

183
00:33:36.974 --> 00:33:38.642
- Hold him!
- Grab it!

184
00:33:46.776 --> 00:33:48.861
-That's it
-Good job.

185
00:33:58.142 --> 00:34:01.583
- Nice landing.
- I think technically is called crashing.

186
00:34:05.962 --> 00:34:09.090
- Luther West.
- Alice.

187
00:34:09.612 --> 00:34:10.759
And this is Claire.

188
00:34:11.906 --> 00:34:13.366
Luther West.

189
00:34:13.366 --> 00:34:14.409
It is a pleasure to meet you.

190
00:34:20.874 --> 00:34:22.959
- Hi! My name is Crystal.
- No. no. no!

191
00:34:22.959 --> 00:34:26.400
Enough with the introductions.
So you're here to help. right?

192
00:34:26.504 --> 00:34:28.486
- can you get us out?
- are you from Arcadia?

193
00:34:28.799 --> 00:34:30.988
- What did you say?
- are you from Arcadia?

194
00:34:31.093 --> 00:34:33.178
- What do you know about Arcadia?
- They said that they can help us!

195
00:34:33.908 --> 00:34:36.411
There are other survivors.
civilization and safety.

196
00:34:36.411 --> 00:34:37.766
Infection free.

197
00:34:37.766 --> 00:34:39.017
So they sent you. right?

198
00:34:39.852 --> 00:34:42.459
- No.
- But there are others out there?

199
00:34:42.459 --> 00:34:45.587
- Like you?
- It's just us.

200
00:34:46.838 --> 00:34:49.862
- There'll be no rescue?
- I'm sorry...Oh...

201
00:34:56.014 --> 00:34:59.351
- Sorry.
- Don't even think about it...they had their hopes up

202
00:35:00.498 --> 00:35:02.479
Thery thought you could take them
to the promise lands.

203
00:35:03.209 --> 00:35:04.461
Angel Ortiz.

204
00:35:05.086 --> 00:35:06.442
That was some fine flying!

205
00:35:07.068 --> 00:35:08.423
Thanks.

206
00:35:16.244 --> 00:35:17.391
What's the prognosis?

207
00:35:18.434 --> 00:35:19.998
- She'll live.
- Yeah.

208
00:35:21.145 --> 00:35:25.316
You know...I have the strangest feeling...

209
00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:26.567
I know you.

210
00:35:28.861 --> 00:35:30.738
Yeah...I get that lot.

211
00:35:31.259 --> 00:35:32.406
You a sports fan. huh?

212
00:35:32.824 --> 00:35:34.179
You like basketball?

213
00:35:34.909 --> 00:35:37.307
- Not really.
- No? Oh.

214
00:35:38.976 --> 00:35:42.313
Then maybe just a fan of...
A fine timepiece.

215
00:35:47.839 --> 00:35:51.489
Yeah. Luther here is our resident
superstar.

216
00:35:52.949 --> 00:35:54.721
So. tell me about Arcadia?

217
00:35:55.556 --> 00:35:56.911
What exactly do you know?

218
00:35:57.328 --> 00:35:58.892
Just what we heard from their transmissions.

219
00:35:59.414 --> 00:36:01.186
We've been recieving that broadcast for a week.

220
00:36:01.916 --> 00:36:03.689
Food and shelter. safety
and security ...

221
00:36:04.002 --> 00:36:06.504
- No infection.
- We thought they sent you.

222
00:36:07.443 --> 00:36:10.050
We launched flares for days
to get their attention.

223
00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:11.927
Flares?

224
00:36:14.221 --> 00:36:16.202
Who gonna see flares
from Alaska?

225
00:36:17.036 --> 00:36:18.288
- Alaska?
- Alaska?

226
00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.269
Arcadia...I've been there.

227
00:36:20.686 --> 00:36:21.833
It's in Alaska.

228
00:36:22.146 --> 00:36:24.544
- It's a town or so we thought.
- A town?

229
00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:27.568
I don't think so.

230
00:36:29.028 --> 00:36:30.279
Take a look.

231
00:36:30.696 --> 00:36:31.739
At what?

232
00:36:37.161 --> 00:36:38.204
You see?

233
00:36:40.394 --> 00:36:41.645
It's not a town.

234
00:36:44.044 --> 00:36:45.191
It's a ship.

235
00:36:46.233 --> 00:36:48.110
I recorded this from the short-wave.

236
00:36:48.944 --> 00:36:51.447
This is Arcadia...broadcasting on the
emergency frequency.

237
00:36:52.073 --> 00:36:55.931
There is no infection. We offer safety and
security. food and shelter.

238
00:36:55.931 --> 00:36:57.808
It's..It's the same message we've heard.

239
00:36:57.808 --> 00:37:00.415
They must have been sailing
up and down the coast picking up survivors.

240
00:37:00.728 --> 00:37:03.439
This is Arcadia...broadcasting on the
emergency frequency.

241
00:37:06.463 --> 00:37:07.610
What is that?

242
00:37:07.923 --> 00:37:08.965
I don't know.

243
00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:11.781
That was the we heard from them.

244
00:37:12.198 --> 00:37:13.658
Then it just stopped.

245
00:37:15.326 --> 00:37:16.577
That was two days ago.

246
00:37:17.933 --> 00:37:19.810
We've been sending up flares on the hour.

247
00:37:20.227 --> 00:37:22.625
And when you have arrived.
of couse. we thought they had sent you.

248
00:37:31.697 --> 00:37:32.740
Claire.

249
00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.556
That ship over there...

250
00:37:36.494 --> 00:37:37.745
That's Arcadia.

251
00:37:37.954 --> 00:37:38.997
I know.

252
00:37:39.831 --> 00:37:42.751
- You remember?
- I remember the beach.

253
00:37:48.799 --> 00:37:50.467
People were coming to help us.

254
00:37:52.031 --> 00:37:54.742
What happened?
Why didn't you go with others?

255
00:37:56.202 --> 00:37:58.705
I don't know. I can't remember.

256
00:38:03.501 --> 00:38:05.274
We have to get to that ship.

257
00:38:06.421 --> 00:38:08.194
<i> We have to get to that ship. </ i></i>

258
00:39:29.424 --> 00:39:30.675
Welcome to your new home.

259
00:39:31.405 --> 00:39:32.657
Cell Block B

260
00:39:40.165 --> 00:39:44.648
Crystal's our cook. The menus are not
extensive. but she's master what she does.

261
00:39:45.587 --> 00:39:47.151
Sorry I didn't bring better news.

262
00:39:47.568 --> 00:39:50.801
Get used to disappointment. right?
That my agent used to say.

263
00:39:51.635 --> 00:39:52.782
Were you an actress?

264
00:39:53.929 --> 00:39:56.536
Came to Hollywood to live the dream
and ended up waiting tables.

265
00:39:56.536 --> 00:39:59.143
Why are we waiting? Excuse me
I'm hungry. Thank you.

266
00:39:59.873 --> 00:40:01.645
- Get out of here.
- Thank you.

267
00:40:05.295 --> 00:40:07.380
I had plenty of creeps right here in my time.

268
00:40:09.362 --> 00:40:10.613
What's his story?

269
00:40:10.613 --> 00:40:13.428
Back in the world. he was
kind of a big movie producer.

270
00:40:13.637 --> 00:40:15.827
The boy's got stick to his ass!

271
00:40:18.955 --> 00:40:22.396
Kim Young used to intern for him
But he still hasn't figured out the world has changed.

272
00:40:36.473 --> 00:40:37.933
That plane of yours...

273
00:40:37.933 --> 00:40:39.080
You think it can still fly?

274
00:40:40.019 --> 00:40:41.791
It can fly...but it only takes two.

275
00:40:42.313 --> 00:40:44.815
So you could take us to
Arcadia one at a time.

276
00:40:44.919 --> 00:40:47.526
Look. I think she was lucky
to land here once.

277
00:40:47.943 --> 00:40:49.820
Five or six times
would be suicide.

278
00:40:51.697 --> 00:40:54.513
- No offense.
- None taken.

279
00:40:59.518 --> 00:41:00.978
There has to be another way out.

280
00:41:01.604 --> 00:41:03.272
We have to get to that ship.

281
00:41:03.272 --> 00:41:05.253
Well... There is the...   (Clears throat)

282
00:41:08.799 --> 00:41:10.988
- What?
- Nothing.

283
00:41:10.988 --> 00:41:14.951
Look. it would be a waste of your time.

284
00:41:17.245 --> 00:41:18.705
I have time to waste.

285
00:41:22.771 --> 00:41:25.378
When shit hit the fan.
We took refuge in the prison.

286
00:41:26.421 --> 00:41:29.028
Seemed like the biggest.
strongest walls...

287
00:41:29.966 --> 00:41:31.843
Best chance of keeping
those thing out.

288
00:41:33.303 --> 00:41:36.536
By the time we got here. the guards
and inmates were already long gone.

289
00:41:37.996 --> 00:41:39.455
I guess...

290
00:41:39.768 --> 00:41:41.541
When peoples starting
eating one other ...

291
00:41:42.271 --> 00:41:44.565
Wasn't much fun keeping
anyone locked up.

292
00:41:46.025 --> 00:41:47.589
We thought the place was abandoned.

293
00:41:49.153 --> 00:41:50.613
Until we made a discoverey.

294
00:41:56.244 --> 00:41:57.287
Wendell...

295
00:41:58.121 --> 00:41:59.372
It's time to take a break.

296
00:41:59.372 --> 00:42:00.832
It's about god damn time.

297
00:42:01.145 --> 00:42:05.211
I hate being down here.
I hear movement...in the walls.

298
00:42:06.463 --> 00:42:07.714
Well. let's check it out.

299
00:42:09.487 --> 00:42:10.738
We'll be back in a minute.

300
00:42:13.345 --> 00:42:14.388
Come on.

301
00:42:52.552 --> 00:42:53.699
Name's Chris.

302
00:42:57.766 --> 00:42:59.435
You're the one flying that plane.

303
00:43:01.833 --> 00:43:02.980
How do you know that?

304
00:43:04.127 --> 00:43:06.317
Wendell isn't only one who hears things.

305
00:43:08.194 --> 00:43:09.654
I am glad you made it.

306
00:43:10.592 --> 00:43:12.886
Maybe you can talk some
sense into these people's.

307
00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:15.910
What do you mean?

308
00:43:18.517 --> 00:43:20.081
Isn't it obvious?

309
00:43:20.707 --> 00:43:21.958
I'm not a prisoner.

310
00:43:23.731 --> 00:43:25.086
I shouldn't be in here.

311
00:43:29.779 --> 00:43:31.760
I was working with military unit.

312
00:43:32.698 --> 00:43:34.680
We were using this place
as a staging post.

313
00:43:36.661 --> 00:43:39.789
Things were already pretty bad when
the order came through from the Governor

314
00:43:39.789 --> 00:43:41.666
to release all immates.

315
00:43:42.605 --> 00:43:46.463
You see. we need as many people on
the streets as possible to fight those things.

316
00:43:48.027 --> 00:43:49.487
And it was chaos.

317
00:43:50.947 --> 00:43:53.553
We were pulling out and a
gang of prisoners jumped me.

318
00:43:54.596 --> 00:43:56.369
Guess they thought I was guard.

319
00:43:57.203 --> 00:43:59.914
When I woke up. my unit was gone ...

320
00:44:00.957 --> 00:44:02.313
And I was in here.

321
00:44:03.251 --> 00:44:04.919
Their idea of joke.

322
00:44:06.796 --> 00:44:08.048
You don't believe me?

323
00:44:11.802 --> 00:44:12.949
If the others ...

324
00:44:13.887 --> 00:44:15.764
You need to get me
out of here.

325
00:44:15.973 --> 00:44:18.058
We're all trapped here
one way or another.

326
00:44:18.058 --> 00:44:20.769
That's true but I can help you.

327
00:44:22.021 --> 00:44:24.315
-Seen enough?
-You find anything?

328
00:44:24.419 --> 00:44:25.566
No.

329
00:44:26.192 --> 00:44:27.756
I know way out of this place.

330
00:44:34.012 --> 00:44:36.306
You get me out of here
I'll do the same for you

331
00:44:38.183 --> 00:44:39.435
You'll gonna need me!

332
00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:44.544
- Have you checked out what its taking about?
- His way out?

333
00:44:45.587 --> 00:44:48.507
He's not telling us shit until we let him out.
And I'm not letting him out.

334
00:44:49.341 --> 00:44:50.488
The man is a killer.

335
00:44:50.801 --> 00:44:52.573
- Really?
- I can see it in his eyes.

336
00:44:52.678 --> 00:44:55.389
- How can you be so sure?
- I know people.

337
00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:57.996
Interesting. Tell me...

338
00:44:59.247 --> 00:45:01.228
What you seen when you look in my eyes?

339
00:45:09.674 --> 00:45:11.447
Whoa!Holy Shit.

340
00:45:13.428 --> 00:45:14.992
Girl's gotta be prepared.

341
00:45:17.704 --> 00:45:19.581
What could you possibly want with those?

342
00:45:20.623 --> 00:45:21.770
It's a hobby.

343
00:45:22.605 --> 00:45:23.856
A hobby?

344
00:45:24.794 --> 00:45:25.837
All right.

345
00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:28.235
Well. I'll see you in the morning.

346
00:45:39.393 --> 00:45:41.166
No sign of anyone on deck.

347
00:45:43.043 --> 00:45:44.398
Your friends are out there.

348
00:45:47.422 --> 00:45:48.465
I think so.

349
00:45:49.716 --> 00:45:51.176
You don't remember?

350
00:45:52.114 --> 00:45:53.470
It's coming back.

351
00:45:54.409 --> 00:45:55.556
Slowly...

352
00:45:59.518 --> 00:46:01.082
Nothing makes any sense.

353
00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:48.799
- We still have running water.
- Very civilized

354
00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:50.571
We do our best.

355
00:47:54.221 --> 00:47:57.349
- It's cold.
- Our best only goes so far.

356
00:47:58.392 --> 00:48:00.373
- These are for you.
- Thank you.

357
00:48:02.459 --> 00:48:03.918
I guess I should leave you to it?

358
00:48:04.961 --> 00:48:06.421
I guess you should.

359
00:48:06.421 --> 00:48:08.507
- I'll be right outside.
- Thank you.

360
00:48:23.314 --> 00:48:24.356
Luther...?

361
00:48:26.859 --> 00:48:28.110
Luther?

362
00:49:20.978 --> 00:49:23.168
- Easy. baby.
Move it!

363
00:49:23.689 --> 00:49:26.400
Hey. I'll just be on my way now.

364
00:49:27.026 --> 00:49:30.988
- Take it easy. take it easy. take it easy.
- I didn't see you.

365
00:50:01.332 --> 00:50:03.314
What is that smell?

366
00:50:03.835 --> 00:50:05.712
Must've burrowed up from the sewers...

367
00:50:06.233 --> 00:50:08.423
Wendell said he heard
things moving behind the walls.

368
00:50:08.423 --> 00:50:10.821
So...so...these can just
burst out anywhere?

369
00:50:11.551 --> 00:50:14.680
- We gotta get out of this place.
- Arcadia will send help.

370
00:50:14.992 --> 00:50:16.035
No one's coming to get us.

371
00:50:16.035 --> 00:50:20.206
Okay? No one.
We have to help ourselves.

372
00:50:20.623 --> 00:50:23.022
- Now this plane that you have?
- It can't hold all of us.

373
00:50:23.022 --> 00:50:24.794
- We draw straws...
- No!

374
00:50:24.794 --> 00:50:27.818
We all get out of here
And no one is left behind

375
00:50:28.235 --> 00:50:29.278
Great.

376
00:50:29.487 --> 00:50:30.529
How are we gunna do that?

377
00:50:31.364 --> 00:50:33.449
Walk out of here...just single file?

378
00:50:33.971 --> 00:50:36.056
Are you crazy?

379
00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:39.184
- They didn't want him getting out.
- That's right. He's dangerous.

380
00:50:39.706 --> 00:50:41.895
Angel...what do you think?

381
00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:45.337
I think we don't have much of a choice.

382
00:50:45.649 --> 00:50:49.508
This is insane. Crystal. Crystal. Crystal?
Look at me. What do you think?

383
00:50:49.508 --> 00:50:51.072
I mean. not even you're that dumb

384
00:50:51.385 --> 00:50:54.513
I guess I am. I agree with Angel.

385
00:50:55.451 --> 00:50:58.267
If this guy knows a way out
I want to hear it.

386
00:50:58.997 --> 00:51:00.039
All right.

387
00:51:00.456 --> 00:51:01.812
Seriously?

388
00:51:03.272 --> 00:51:05.253
This...this is a mistake.

389
00:51:06.192 --> 00:51:09.424
- This is a big mistake.
- You'd better keep your eyes on him.

390
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:23.918
I was wondering how long it would take.

391
00:51:39.038 --> 00:51:41.020
Boo!Ahh!
Alright. let's get the hell out of here.

392
00:51:44.878 --> 00:51:46.650
- Claire?
- What?

393
00:51:50.821 --> 00:51:52.073
Claire. it's me.

394
00:51:57.287 --> 00:51:58.434
It's Chris.

395
00:52:01.979 --> 00:52:04.273
- I don't know you.
- Claire?

396
00:52:05.837 --> 00:52:07.401
I'm your brother. remember?

397
00:52:09.070 --> 00:52:10.425
What the hell has happened to you?

398
00:52:12.511 --> 00:52:15.118
Hey. It's okay. Let him go.

399
00:52:20.123 --> 00:52:21.895
Look. she suffered some sort
of memory loss.

400
00:52:22.938 --> 00:52:25.858
If you really are her brother...
It will come back.

401
00:52:27.943 --> 00:52:30.967
Alright. this is very touching...
I mean. a family reunion...

402
00:52:30.967 --> 00:52:35.138
But if we could just get a move on please?
Before we are all eaten the fuck alive!

403
00:52:45.566 --> 00:52:50.050
Behind those doors is a UPV:
Urban Pacification Vehicle.

404
00:52:50.258 --> 00:52:52.448
Prison kept it in case of a serious riot.

405
00:52:52.448 --> 00:52:56.619
16 wheeler. steel plated.
water cannon. seats 20

406
00:52:57.662 --> 00:52:59.017
Ten tons of fun.

407
00:52:59.747 --> 00:53:02.876
Roll on out style. drive right over 'em.

408
00:53:02.876 --> 00:53:04.231
The lock's jammed.

409
00:53:04.961 --> 00:53:07.568
- Maybe we could cut through it.
- When we hit the coast

410
00:53:07.568 --> 00:53:09.236
We're going to have to trasfer
to a boat or something.

411
00:53:09.549 --> 00:53:12.052
- We gonna need some more fire power.
- I got you covered.

412
00:53:12.782 --> 00:53:15.597
When I was stationed here
We used a room in the basement as an armory.

413
00:53:16.119 --> 00:53:17.996
It's got every weapon
you can dream of.

414
00:53:18.621 --> 00:53:21.332
How do you know you're unit didn't take
them with 'em when they pulled out?

415
00:53:21.541 --> 00:53:24.565
Because...by the end...
There were lot more guns

416
00:53:24.565 --> 00:53:26.338
than people to use them.

417
00:53:30.926 --> 00:53:32.177
You go get the guns! Luther!

418
00:53:36.869 --> 00:53:38.016
Oh! My god!

419
00:53:45.211 --> 00:53:46.254
What is this?

420
00:53:46.358 --> 00:53:48.861
They had pumps to keep the water
out of the foundations.

421
00:53:49.904 --> 00:53:53.658
When electricity failed.
some of the lower levels start filling up.

422
00:53:54.388 --> 00:53:56.160
There are another two
floors down there

423
00:53:57.203 --> 00:53:58.663
How far down is the armory?

424
00:54:00.019 --> 00:54:01.270
All the way.

425
00:54:03.668 --> 00:54:04.919
Luther. come on!

426
00:54:06.275 --> 00:54:08.256
Get back! Get back!

427
00:54:14.826 --> 00:54:18.058
- Where do you think you're going?
- I was swimming champ back in high school.

428
00:54:19.935 --> 00:54:22.229
- Is that right?
- Here.

429
00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:29.528
So now you're gunna trust me with a gun?

430
00:54:30.050 --> 00:54:31.718
Yeah. Why not?

431
00:54:35.681 --> 00:54:37.245
Luther. just shoot
That motherfucker.

432
00:54:44.023 --> 00:54:45.483
What the fuck is that thing?

433
00:57:12.615 --> 00:57:15.013
All right. Let's go.

434
00:57:33.053 --> 00:57:34.617
Let's go!

435
00:57:59.956 --> 00:58:01.312
Nice.

436
00:58:16.536 --> 00:58:17.683
Damn.

437
00:58:36.139 --> 00:58:38.016
There must be hundreds of them out there.

438
00:58:39.476 --> 00:58:41.040
We can't go back that way.

439
00:58:46.358 --> 00:58:48.757
- Oh shit!
- What? What do you mean. "Oh shit!"?

440
00:58:49.591 --> 00:58:50.738
What? What is this?

441
00:58:52.302 --> 00:58:55.639
- What do you think it is?
- Oh! Don't tell me that thing fits inside of there.

442
00:58:55.952 --> 00:58:57.516
Can you put this back together?

443
00:58:58.037 --> 00:58:59.914
Maybe. but it could take a week.

444
00:59:01.061 --> 00:59:02.313
What do we do now?

445
00:59:03.147 --> 00:59:04.294
I know.

446
00:59:10.446 --> 00:59:14.200
Bennett...What have you done?

447
00:59:21.916 --> 00:59:23.376
Luther. we gotta get out of here!

448
00:59:23.898 --> 00:59:25.149
Come on!

449
00:59:52.469 --> 00:59:53.825
Do you hear that?

450
00:59:58.934 --> 01:00:01.228
- Come on. baby. Come on!
- What are we doing?

451
01:00:01.228 --> 01:00:03.314
- We getting outta here!
- But the others...

452
01:00:03.314 --> 01:00:06.129
Fuck the others!
Now get on board.

453
01:00:06.129 --> 01:00:08.006
Bennett!
What are you doing?

454
01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:10.821
- Hey!
- Kim Yong! Don't do this.

455
01:00:11.447 --> 01:00:12.594
Open this door!

456
01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:15.827
Please! Please!

457
01:00:21.145 --> 01:00:22.187
Bennett!

458
01:00:30.112 --> 01:00:31.155
Shit!

459
01:00:32.719 --> 01:00:34.388
Thats right. bitch! Fuck you!

460
01:00:40.123 --> 01:00:42.521
Yes! Yes!

461
01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:45.337
- Fuckin' bitch...
- I'm sorry.

462
01:00:45.962 --> 01:00:47.214
I'm so sorry.

463
01:00:47.318 --> 01:00:48.778
He's heading for the Arcadia.

464
01:01:01.916 --> 01:01:03.063
Alice!

465
01:01:24.857 --> 01:01:25.900
Come on!

466
01:01:41.124 --> 01:01:42.584
Hit the cell block!

467
01:01:44.878 --> 01:01:47.380
- Move!
- I'll meet you there!

468
01:01:49.779 --> 01:01:51.030
This thing has no power!

469
01:01:51.864 --> 01:01:53.324
We won't need power!

470
01:01:58.538 --> 01:01:59.581
Oh shit!

471
01:02:23.981 --> 01:02:25.962
Hey. head for the shower block. Go!

472
01:03:26.859 --> 01:03:27.902
Over Here!

473
01:04:18.475 --> 01:04:21.291
- You alright?
- I'm fine. Thanks.

474
01:04:24.627 --> 01:04:26.400
This is a joke. right?

475
01:04:27.339 --> 01:04:29.841
- No.
- Tunnels leads to the sewers. sewers lead to

476
01:04:29.946 --> 01:04:30.988
the storm drains...

477
01:04:30.988 --> 01:04:32.448
Storm drains leads to sea.

478
01:04:33.699 --> 01:04:34.846
It's our only chance.

479
01:04:35.055 --> 01:04:37.349
I'll take point. I got your back.

480
01:04:41.624 --> 01:04:42.771
Ladies...

481
01:04:47.777 --> 01:04:48.819
Alright. you next.

482
01:04:50.905 --> 01:04:52.886
- I can't do it.
- You can.

483
01:04:54.867 --> 01:04:56.014
Let's go!

484
01:09:04.815 --> 01:09:07.735
Shhh...Those things are close.

485
01:09:09.508 --> 01:09:11.489
We found a way out
Just out there

486
01:09:11.697 --> 01:09:14.304
The tunnel drop into
a storm drain. Go.

487
01:09:24.106 --> 01:09:25.357
Where's Kim Yong?

488
01:09:28.381 --> 01:09:29.633
Go. Go!

489
01:09:46.212 --> 01:09:47.464
Knew you'd make it.

490
01:09:56.849 --> 01:09:58.100
Luther!

491
01:10:00.915 --> 01:10:02.167
Go!

492
01:10:04.982 --> 01:10:06.233
Luther!

493
01:10:11.656 --> 01:10:13.220
We can't help him now.

494
01:10:15.514 --> 01:10:17.078
We have to move on.

495
01:11:47.485 --> 01:11:48.944
No welcome party. huh?

496
01:12:08.861 --> 01:12:10.321
Looks like Bennett made it.

497
01:12:13.136 --> 01:12:14.596
Let's check inside.

498
01:12:33.366 --> 01:12:35.347
- Find anyone?
- Nothing.

499
01:12:36.077 --> 01:12:38.788
I checked the crew quarters...
They're all gone.

500
01:12:39.622 --> 01:12:41.291
Looks like they left in hurry.

501
01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:46.504
This is Arcadia. broadcasting on the
emergency frequency.

502
01:12:46.504 --> 01:12:50.675
There is no infection. We offer safety
and security. food and shelter.

503
01:12:52.865 --> 01:12:55.785
Fuel...power...Everything's
Running normally.

504
01:12:55.785 --> 01:12:58.183
Look at this. It's the ships log.

505
01:12:58.913 --> 01:13:00.894
Crew launched the life
boats three days ago.

506
01:13:01.729 --> 01:13:03.710
Exactly when the transmission stopped.

507
01:13:04.231 --> 01:13:07.672
But it says ther's still
2.000 survivors on board.

508
01:13:15.284 --> 01:13:17.266
We have to search every inch of the ship.

509
01:13:34.575 --> 01:13:37.287
Umbrella...of course.

510
01:13:38.955 --> 01:13:40.623
Never where coming for us.

511
01:13:58.454 --> 01:13:59.497
This whole thing...

512
01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:01.270
The beacon...

513
01:14:02.313 --> 01:14:03.355
Was a lie.

514
01:14:03.981 --> 01:14:05.128
And that's not the worst part.

515
01:14:06.484 --> 01:14:07.422
It's a trap!

516
01:14:43.293 --> 01:14:44.440
Where is everybody?

517
01:14:49.132 --> 01:14:50.383
I don't understand.

518
01:14:58.830 --> 01:14:59.977
I think I do.

519
01:15:01.958 --> 01:15:03.314
They're underneath our feet.

520
01:15:10.821 --> 01:15:13.116
They're holding survivors
to experiment on them.

521
01:15:15.618 --> 01:15:16.557
Look...

522
01:15:18.121 --> 01:15:19.268
It's K-Mart...she's here.

523
01:15:20.311 --> 01:15:23.543
Bring them up. All of them.

524
01:15:43.772 --> 01:15:46.379
Here she is...K-mart

525
01:15:46.901 --> 01:15:47.943
Get her out.

526
01:15:51.697 --> 01:15:52.740
Baa.

527
01:15:52.949 --> 01:15:55.243
K-Mart. It's okay.
It's okay.

528
01:15:55.764 --> 01:15:57.537
K-Mart. ok. it's all right.

529
01:15:57.641 --> 01:15:58.684
I'll get that thing off her.

530
01:15:58.788 --> 01:16:00.039
Go let everyone else out.

531
01:16:00.456 --> 01:16:03.063
We your friends.
and right now. I need your help.

532
01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:04.627
Let me get this off of you.

533
01:18:46.567 --> 01:18:48.131
Why am I not surprised?

534
01:18:49.382 --> 01:18:50.947
You weren't too hard to find

535
01:18:51.885 --> 01:18:54.075
Our satellite system
is still operational.

536
01:18:54.909 --> 01:18:57.203
And not as many people fly these days.

537
01:18:58.454 --> 01:19:02.938
Besides. I always knew
You'd be drawn to your friends.

538
01:19:04.190 --> 01:19:05.649
Loyalty...

539
01:19:06.066 --> 01:19:07.318
Highly overrated.

540
01:19:11.489 --> 01:19:12.532
Stop!

541
01:19:14.617 --> 01:19:16.077
Down!

542
01:19:17.641 --> 01:19:19.622
Wouldn't want you
Harming my pets

543
01:19:23.168 --> 01:19:24.732
Drop your guns.

544
01:19:30.988 --> 01:19:32.344
Good...kick them to me.

545
01:19:35.994 --> 01:19:37.036
Your hands.

546
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:42.250
You don't look so good. Bennett.

547
01:19:43.188 --> 01:19:46.317
Yeah. I am looking forward to
Playing with your pretty face.

548
01:19:46.525 --> 01:19:47.464
What do you want from me?

549
01:19:48.611 --> 01:19:50.383
The T-virus brought me back.

550
01:19:56.327 --> 01:19:58.204
But it's so strong.

551
01:19:59.143 --> 01:20:01.020
It fights for full control.

552
01:20:03.001 --> 01:20:05.712
And I thought that if
I ingested fresh human DNA

553
01:20:06.442 --> 01:20:08.215
I could redress the balance.

554
01:20:08.944 --> 01:20:11.030
No wonder your crew
abandoned ship.

555
01:20:11.864 --> 01:20:15.514
No matter.
Now I have a new subordinate.

556
01:20:16.348 --> 01:20:17.704
And a new plan.

557
01:20:18.225 --> 01:20:21.562
You were the only one who
successfully bonded with the T-virus.

558
01:20:22.605 --> 01:20:24.690
Your DNA is stronger than the others.

559
01:20:25.941 --> 01:20:30.008
I ingest you...
I gain control.

560
01:20:33.136 --> 01:20:34.700
That's pretty smart thinking.

561
01:20:35.535 --> 01:20:37.829
There is only one problem
with that plan.

562
01:20:38.142 --> 01:20:39.497
Stop. Right. right there.

563
01:20:41.166 --> 01:20:42.313
And what is that?

564
01:20:43.251 --> 01:20:44.607
I'm not on the menu.

565
01:21:24.336 --> 01:21:27.360
Well. isn't this one big
family reunion?

566
01:21:28.819 --> 01:21:34.763
Chris & Claire Redfield...you've really
become quite inconvenience for me.

567
01:21:37.161 --> 01:21:39.247
I told you I'd be bringing a few friends.

568
01:21:44.565 --> 01:21:46.233
You should've brought more.

569
01:23:03.084 --> 01:23:04.023
Claire!

570
01:23:04.961 --> 01:23:06.004
Claire!

571
01:23:58.350 --> 01:24:00.853
Don't...even think about it.

572
01:24:08.465 --> 01:24:09.820
Who the fuck are you?

573
01:25:01.854 --> 01:25:03.209
I don't think so.

574
01:25:25.211 --> 01:25:27.610
No! Don't do that! I'm a producer!

575
01:25:30.425 --> 01:25:32.094
Open those doors!

576
01:25:32.615 --> 01:25:36.786
You're deal with some serious consequences
You motherfuckers.

577
01:25:37.516 --> 01:25:38.454
Open the...

578
01:25:42.938 --> 01:25:45.337
You're gonna live to regret this.
All of ya!

579
01:25:53.470 --> 01:25:54.617
Oh god.

580
01:25:56.181 --> 01:25:57.433
I just wanna go home.

581
01:26:06.817 --> 01:26:09.111
Hey. It's gonna be okay.

582
01:26:12.448 --> 01:26:13.282
No!

583
01:26:13.699 --> 01:26:14.846
Where is Alice!

584
01:26:35.076 --> 01:26:36.223
Come on!

585
01:27:16.786 --> 01:27:18.037
Yeah!

586
01:27:19.706 --> 01:27:21.270
I really didn't want you to miss that.

587
01:27:41.812 --> 01:27:42.855
Let's Rock!

588
01:27:44.523 --> 01:27:45.983
Start somethin' bitches.

589
01:27:58.079 --> 01:27:59.226
It's a miracle.

590
01:28:01.729 --> 01:28:04.440
I never dreamed that was
this many of them left alive.

591
01:28:08.715 --> 01:28:09.862
So what next?

592
01:28:15.597 --> 01:28:18.204
<i> This is Arcadia. broadcasting on the
emergency frequency. </ i></i>

593
01:28:20.707 --> 01:28:24.878
I say...that we live up to the promise.

594
01:28:26.442 --> 01:28:29.987
This is Arcadia. broadcasting on the
emergency frequency.

595
01:28:30.613 --> 01:28:33.116
<i> Location: 118.30 degrees West. </ i></i>

596

We will help you

There is hope.

603
01:29:16.285 --> 01:29:18.058
- What is that?
- Trouble.

604
01:30:33.241 --> 01:30:35.535
Deployment T-minus 57 seconds.

605
01:30:35.535 --> 01:30:38.350
when you hit the deck.
you watch your formation.

606
01:30:38.559 --> 01:30:41.061
Take no prisoners. shoot to kill . 

607
01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:43.251
Total enemy numbers are unknown. 

608
01:30:43.355 --> 01:30:46.692
but will include Umbrella fugitives and prime targets 

609
01:30:46.796 --> 01:30:50.550
Claire Redfield. Chris Redfield.
and project Alice. 

610
01:30:51.593 --> 01:30:53.366
So Keep Up 

611
