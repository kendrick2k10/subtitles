distracted lately

64

this right

from the New York Times

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:18.417
Roger. Roger Giles.

186
00:09:18.458 --> 00:09:20.375
Well. Roger. I'm gonna need you
to get back on the stage

187
00:09:20.458 --> 00:09:21.667
with the rest of the cast.

188
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:22.500
Well. I just...

189
00:09:22.583 --> 00:09:24.083
No.

190
00:10:21.041 --> 00:10:22.500
I don't believe this.

191
00:10:22.583 --> 00:10:24.959
Why does this keep happening
to me?

192
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.083
That's a good question.
Mr. Kwan.

193
00:10:27.166 --> 00:10:28.417
I saw someone.

194
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.709
What?

195
00:10:29.792 --> 00:10:32.291
In the costume room. when I
went to go look for Cassandra.

196
00:10:32.375 --> 00:10:34.458
You think it was the killer?

197
00:10:34.542 --> 00:10:35.917
Maybe.

198
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.792
Who was it?

199
00:10:37.875 --> 00:10:40.208
I don't know. I didn't get
a good look at them.

200
00:10:40.291 --> 00:10:43.208
Did they get a good look at you?

201
00:10:43.333 --> 00:10:46.417
I'd like to say that I'm
surprised to see you here.

202
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.250
but I'm not.

203
00:10:48.333 --> 00:10:49.709
Hello. Detective Acosta.

204
00:10:49.792 --> 00:10:51.625
Miss Adams.

205
00:10:51.709 --> 00:10:53.250
Maya.

206
00:10:53.333 --> 00:10:54.667
How are you guys doing?

207
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:58.375
Uh. she's been better.
She just found a dead body.

208
00:11:01.375 --> 00:11:04.709
You know. how is it
that you always seem to be

209
00:11:04.792 --> 00:11:07.542
in the wrong place
at the wrong time?

210
00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:10.625
Well. I think it just depends
on how you look at it.

211
00:11:10.709 --> 00:11:11.959
Oh? How so?

212
00:11:12.041 --> 00:11:15.125
Maybe I'm just in the right
place at the right time.

213
00:11:15.208 --> 00:11:16.750
Hmm.

214
00:11:16.834 --> 00:11:21.417
Well. if you're up for it.
I could use your help.

215
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.208
I thought you'd never ask.

216
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:35.417
Ok. so... walk me through it.

217
00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.834
You are in here looking
for Cassandra.

218
00:11:37.917 --> 00:11:40.709
Uh. I was coming down the
corridor and I heard a crash

219
00:11:40.792 --> 00:11:44.250
so I came inside and I called
out for Cassandra

220
00:11:44.333 --> 00:11:47.583
but she didn't answer.
and that's when I noticed

221
00:11:47.667 --> 00:11:50.250
the broken lamp on the floor.

222
00:11:50.333 --> 00:11:53.125
So I bent down to pick it up

223
00:11:53.208 --> 00:11:56.000
and then I heard footsteps
running out the door.

224
00:11:56.083 --> 00:11:56.917
Which door?

225
00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:57.750
That one.

226
00:11:57.834 --> 00:11:59.291
Did you see who it was?

227
00:11:59.375 --> 00:12:00.417
I didn't.

228
00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.625
It all happened so fast.

229
00:12:02.709 --> 00:12:04.875
Ok. Alright.

230
00:12:04.959 --> 00:12:07.125
You know what?
Let's try something.

231
00:12:07.208 --> 00:12:08.041
Ok.

232
00:12:08.083 --> 00:12:12.250
- Um. just stand right here.
- Oh.

233
00:12:12.375 --> 00:12:14.333
And close your eyes.

234
00:12:14.417 --> 00:12:16.417
What? Are you serious?

235
00:12:16.458 --> 00:12:17.917
Yeah.

236
00:12:20.417 --> 00:12:24.417
Ok. now concentrate on my voice.

237
00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:25.667
Mmmhmm.

238
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.750
Think back to that moment.

239
00:12:27.792 --> 00:12:32.417
You're standing there. you're
holding the lamp in your hand

240
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:36.333
and you hear a sound.

241
00:12:36.417 --> 00:12:42.917
Now. you turn towards the sound
and you see someone.

242
00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:45.083
Who is it?

243
00:12:46.375 --> 00:12:48.583
I can't tell. it's-
it's really dark.

244
00:12:48.667 --> 00:12:52.959
Ok. well is it a man
or is it a woman?

245
00:12:53.041 --> 00:12:56.624
I don't know.
I-I don't know.

246
00:12:56.625 --> 00:12:58.750
I'm sorry.

247
00:12:58.834 --> 00:13:02.125
Ok. Well. at least we tried.

248
00:13:02.166 --> 00:13:04.458
Um. do you wanna show me
what else happened?

249
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.875
Uh-huh. Yeah.

250
00:13:06.959 --> 00:13:11.667
Uh. so I walked down here and
that is where I found Cassandra.

251
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.166
so I ran to get help.

252
00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:15.333
You left?

253
00:13:15.417 --> 00:13:16.458
Yes.

254
00:13:16.542 --> 00:13:18.625
That means there was
a window of time

255
00:13:18.667 --> 00:13:21.125
after the murder that
the room was empty.

256
00:13:21.208 --> 00:13:24.625
Uh. a few minutes. Why?

257
00:13:24.667 --> 00:13:27.834
What if the killer came back?

258
00:13:27.917 --> 00:13:30.375
Cassandra. she was here
because she spilled coffee

259
00:13:30.458 --> 00:13:31.500
on her costume.

260
00:13:31.583 --> 00:13:32.917
But it was a fluke.

261
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.375
She wouldn't have been
back here otherwise.

262
00:13:35.458 --> 00:13:37.709
So someone found themselves
alone with her

263
00:13:37.792 --> 00:13:40.792
and made a split second decision
to kill her.

264
00:13:40.834 --> 00:13:42.542
Right here.

265
00:13:42.625 --> 00:13:45.208
Why would the killer come back?

266
00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:48.208
You see. when you don't have
time to prevent your mistakes

267
00:13:48.291 --> 00:13:50.834
your focus shifts
to covering them up.

268
00:13:50.917 --> 00:13:54.625
And that is when you
make more of them.

269
00:13:58.083 --> 00:14:01.041
The victim. 27-year-old
Cassandra Griffin.

270
00:14:01.125 --> 00:14:03.125
Any witnesses?

271
00:14:03.208 --> 00:14:05.083
There's one.

272
00:14:05.166 --> 00:14:06.959
Name?

273
00:14:07.041 --> 00:14:08.333
Allie Adams.

274
00:14:08.375 --> 00:14:09.291
The photographer?

275
00:14:09.375 --> 00:14:10.375
Uh-huh.

276
00:14:10.458 --> 00:14:11.625
Isn't she a friend of yours?

277
00:14:11.709 --> 00:14:13.667
[chuckles] Well. you know.
we're friends.

278
00:14:13.709 --> 00:14:15.208
We've met a couple times.
whatever.

279
00:14:15.291 --> 00:14:17.667
Mmmhmm. Well. it is
a small town.

280
00:14:17.709 --> 00:14:19.542
Anyways. uh. she didn't see much

281
00:14:19.625 --> 00:14:21.667
but her statement gives us
a pretty firm time of death.

282
00:14:21.709 --> 00:14:23.750
which should help us narrow down
anybody with opportunity.

283
00:14:23.834 --> 00:14:25.083
Manual strangulation?

284
00:14:25.166 --> 00:14:26.166
Ligature.

285
00:14:26.208 --> 00:14:27.750
Left a pretty distinctive
pattern behind.

286
00:14:27.834 --> 00:14:29.667
But our coroner should have
more for us soon.

287
00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:31.542
Ok. Anything else?

288
00:14:31.583 --> 00:14:33.792
You know. our victim had
no restraining orders.

289
00:14:33.875 --> 00:14:35.041
no open cases.

290
00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:37.000
but her tires had been slashed
the night of the murder.

291
00:14:37.083 --> 00:14:38.083
I want updates as they come.

292
00:14:38.166 --> 00:14:39.917
Yes. ma'am.

293
00:14:41.834 --> 00:14:42.583
Go.

294
00:14:42.667 --> 00:14:43.959
Ok.

295
00:14:46.625 --> 00:14:48.333
Are you sure she was crying?

296
00:14:48.417 --> 00:14:49.750
She tried to play it off
when I interrupted

297
00:14:49.834 --> 00:14:51.375
but she seemed pretty upset.

298
00:14:51.458 --> 00:14:53.458
And 10 minutes later she's dead.

299
00:14:53.542 --> 00:14:55.417
Hardly coincidental.

300
00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:56.583
How's Maya?

301
00:14:56.667 --> 00:14:57.667
Pretty shaken up.

302
00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:59.125
They worked on that play
for months.

303
00:14:59.208 --> 00:15:00.500
The cast got pretty close.

304
00:15:00.583 --> 00:15:03.792
Well. my mom's friend is a grief
counsellor. great listener.

305
00:15:03.875 --> 00:15:05.875
It could help.

306
00:15:05.917 --> 00:15:07.083
Yeah.

307
00:15:07.166 --> 00:15:10.417
I don't think Maya's ready
to talk to anyone just yet.

308
00:15:10.458 --> 00:15:13.917
A brush with death
changes a person.

309
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.250
But I knew I had to be strong.

310
00:15:15.291 --> 00:15:17.792
I mean. for the sake of
the cast and crew. you know?

311
00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:22.208
I could sense they were all
looking to me for guidance.

312
00:15:22.291 --> 00:15:24.125
Right. Yeah.

313
00:15:24.208 --> 00:15:26.583
Um. well. can you describe what
you saw in the costume room?

314
00:15:26.667 --> 00:15:29.000
Uh. well Cassandra's neck
had these weird marks.

315
00:15:29.083 --> 00:15:30.750
like-like in a pattern.

316
00:15:30.834 --> 00:15:31.875
Allie could tell you more.

317
00:15:31.959 --> 00:15:33.250
She's the one who found the body...

318
00:15:33.333 --> 00:15:36.375
Hi. Yeah. um. actually Maya
does not recollect anything

319
00:15:36.458 --> 00:15:38.208
from that evening.

320
00:15:38.291 --> 00:15:39.583
Uh. I recollect just fine.

321
00:15:39.625 --> 00:15:42.959
Maya. It's an active
investigation.

322
00:15:43.041 --> 00:15:44.375
Daniel. will you do me a favor

323
00:15:44.458 --> 00:15:46.583
and keep this off the front page
of The Gazette. please?

324
00:15:46.667 --> 00:15:49.917
Yeah. I guess I could hide it
in the background for now.

325
00:15:49.959 --> 00:15:50.792
Thanks.

326
00:15:50.875 --> 00:15:52.542
- Thank you for your time.
- Mmmhmm.

327
00:15:52.625 --> 00:15:54.000
Maya!

328
00:15:54.083 --> 00:15:55.875
You know. I love the new place.

329
00:15:55.917 --> 00:15:57.166
It's very you.

330
00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:58.625
Thank you.

331
00:15:58.667 --> 00:15:59.458
I think.

332
00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:01.333
You got plans tomorrow night?

333
00:16:01.417 --> 00:16:04.458
Uh. yeah. actually.
It's movie night with Maya.

334
00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.500
Oh. um. I forgot to tell you.

335
00:16:06.583 --> 00:16:08.667
I have to cancel.

336
00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:14.625
Audition for a...
dog food commercial.

337
00:16:14.709 --> 00:16:18.750
Ok. Uh. how about drinks
at the Ace of Clubs. 8:00?

338
00:16:18.834 --> 00:16:21.125
I promise I will keep
my notebook closed.

339
00:16:21.166 --> 00:16:22.792
She'd love to!

340
00:16:22.875 --> 00:16:24.583
Wouldn't you. Allie?

341
00:16:27.083 --> 00:16:28.041
Yeah.

342
00:16:28.125 --> 00:16:29.417
Yeah. sure. Ok.

343
00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:32.291
Ok. great. I will
meet you there.

344
00:16:36.208 --> 00:16:37.792
You don't have an audition.
do you?

345
00:16:37.875 --> 00:16:39.959
Uh. I might have one.

346
00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:41.291
Ugh. Maya.

347
00:16:41.375 --> 00:16:43.083
I just think it's a crime
you haven't been on a date.

348
00:16:43.166 --> 00:16:46.917
like an actual date. date
since you and...

349
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.625
I have to work.

350
00:16:54.291 --> 00:16:58.166
Over the last few months I feel
like we've become a family.

351
00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:01.291
and families get through
hardships together.

352
00:17:01.375 --> 00:17:02.959
As each of us attempts

353
00:17:03.041 --> 00:17:05.500
to navigate the choppy seas
of grief.

354
00:17:05.542 --> 00:17:08.291
Sara and I want you to know
that if there is anything.

355
00:17:08.375 --> 00:17:12.250
anything at all that you need.
please don't hesitate to ask.

356
00:17:13.375 --> 00:17:14.333
Yes?

357
00:17:14.417 --> 00:17:15.458
What happens now?

358
00:17:15.542 --> 00:17:17.375
The police will conduct
their investigation

359
00:17:17.458 --> 00:17:21.792
and hopefully Cassandra's family
and friends will find closure.

360
00:17:21.875 --> 00:17:22.667
Oh.

361
00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:24.542
I meant with the play.

362
00:17:24.667 --> 00:17:28.875
The play is postponed.
indefinitely.

363
00:17:28.917 --> 00:17:31.709
Cass is dead. Laura.

364
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:33.333
Well. we're not.

365
00:17:33.417 --> 00:17:35.000
I spent three months of my life
on that play.

366
00:17:35.083 --> 00:17:36.917
I understand your
disappointment.

367
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.917
and it may have been
three months of your life.

368
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.458
but it was nearly two years
of mine.

369
00:17:41.542 --> 00:17:42.709
It's out of our hands.

370
00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:44.625
The theatre is an active
crime scene.

371
00:17:44.709 --> 00:17:48.500
We have food and drinks for
everyone in the dining room.

372
00:17:48.583 --> 00:17:51.750
Please feel free to stay
as long as you like.

373
00:17:57.917 --> 00:17:59.583
You ok?

374
00:18:01.709 --> 00:18:03.500
I'll be alright.

375
00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:06.667
[sighs]

376
00:18:12.458 --> 00:18:15.417
Apparently the police never
recovered her cell phone.

377
00:18:15.458 --> 00:18:16.208
Really?

378
00:18:16.291 --> 00:18:17.250
Mmmhmm.

379
00:18:17.291 --> 00:18:18.583
Where do you think it is?

380
00:18:18.667 --> 00:18:20.834
With the killer. most likely.

381
00:18:22.458 --> 00:18:24.333
Have you seen Roger?

382
00:18:24.417 --> 00:18:26.792
He would have a lot of nerve
showing up here.

383
00:18:26.875 --> 00:18:28.166
Why is that?

384
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:30.709
Didn't you hear what happened
between him and Cassandra?

385
00:18:30.792 --> 00:18:31.792
No.

386
00:18:38.625 --> 00:18:40.750
Maya?

387
00:18:40.834 --> 00:18:42.250
What're you doing?

388
00:18:42.333 --> 00:18:44.166
You heard him.
The show's closed.

389
00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:46.375
A girl's gotta eat. you know.

390
00:18:49.917 --> 00:18:52.375
Wait. where are you going?

391
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:24.458
Look at all this stuff.

392
00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:28.583
Remind me never to use
his interior decorator.

393
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.792
It's not real.

394
00:19:33.834 --> 00:19:34.959
Sorry.

395
00:19:35.041 --> 00:19:37.208
We don't mean to snoop.
it's just all very interesting.

396
00:19:37.333 --> 00:19:39.083
Oh. no. that's quite alright.

397
00:19:39.166 --> 00:19:40.625
I'm very fond of this.

398
00:19:40.709 --> 00:19:44.041
It's from my first play.
"Murder By Numbers".

399
00:19:45.041 --> 00:19:46.750
See? Just a prop.

400
00:19:46.834 --> 00:19:48.834
That's all theatre really is.

401
00:19:48.917 --> 00:19:51.166
Nothing but make believe.

402
00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:52.750
Yeah.

403
00:19:52.834 --> 00:19:55.458
It must have a lot
of sentimental value.

404
00:19:55.542 --> 00:19:56.959
Well. for more reasons than one.

405
00:19:57.041 --> 00:19:58.750
Sara and I met
on that production.

406
00:19:58.834 --> 00:20:00.208
She was my costumer.

407
00:20:00.291 --> 00:20:01.291
Awe.

408
00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.667
Do they have any idea
who could have done this?

409
00:20:04.709 --> 00:20:06.750
Well. if they do.
they haven't told me.

410
00:20:06.834 --> 00:20:08.208
Or any of us.

411
00:20:08.291 --> 00:20:10.375
With good reason. I suppose.

412
00:20:10.458 --> 00:20:13.959
Are you saying the police think
it could have been one of us?

413
00:20:14.041 --> 00:20:16.166
Well. the cast and crew
were the only ones

414
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:18.500
with access to the back stage.

415
00:20:18.542 --> 00:20:21.375
And you. Allie
and your assistant.

416
00:20:21.458 --> 00:20:24.542
Do you have any idea
what the motive could be?

417
00:20:24.625 --> 00:20:26.250
I couldn't even guess.

418
00:20:26.333 --> 00:20:29.041
But I do know that the only
people who had the opportunity

419
00:20:29.125 --> 00:20:31.667
are right here in this house.

420
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:34.917
Allie. it must have
been frightening.

421
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.458
finding her like that.

422
00:20:37.542 --> 00:20:41.583
Not as frightening as Allie
being five feet from the killer.

423
00:20:41.667 --> 00:20:46.041
I didn't know that you had seen
someone in the costume room.

424
00:20:46.125 --> 00:20:50.125
Um. I didn't really
see anything.

425
00:20:50.208 --> 00:20:53.458
Oh. well. I meant what I said.

426
00:20:53.542 --> 00:20:57.208
If there is anything that I can
do for either of you.

427
00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:59.875
I'm here for you.

428
00:20:59.917 --> 00:21:02.083
We're all in this together.

429
00:21:10.917 --> 00:21:12.333
It's unsettling. isn't it?

430
00:21:12.417 --> 00:21:13.333
What?

431
00:21:13.417 --> 00:21:14.959
I mean. we could be standing
10 feet away

432
00:21:15.041 --> 00:21:17.500
from a cold-blooded killer.

433
00:21:17.583 --> 00:21:21.667
You don't think he or she would
actually show up here. do you?

434
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:24.500
Gotta keep up appearances.

435
00:21:24.583 --> 00:21:25.291
[door slams]

436
00:21:25.375 --> 00:21:27.083
Neil: Keep your voice down!

437
00:21:27.166 --> 00:21:28.417
How could you not tell me?

438
00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.250
How was I supposed to know
that this would happen?

439
00:21:31.333 --> 00:21:32.542
That is a lot of money. Neil.

440
00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:34.792
How are we supposed
to pay it back?

441
00:21:34.875 --> 00:21:37.333
I said I would figure this out.

442
00:21:37.417 --> 00:21:38.709
If you had just been honest with me...

443
00:21:38.792 --> 00:21:39.667
Sara.

444
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:41.083
Don't do this.

445
00:21:41.125 --> 00:21:42.250
Not today.

446
00:21:42.333 --> 00:21:44.000
Then when?

447
00:21:45.458 --> 00:21:46.709
[sighs]

448
00:21:55.417 --> 00:21:56.208
Hey.

449
00:21:56.291 --> 00:21:58.083
Hey.
Anything back on the note?

450
00:21:58.166 --> 00:22:01.542
Oh yeah. Clean.

451
00:22:01.625 --> 00:22:03.417
Handwriting might give
us something.

452
00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:04.291
What are these?

453
00:22:04.375 --> 00:22:05.208
Props for the play.

454
00:22:05.291 --> 00:22:06.250
Wow.

455
00:22:06.333 --> 00:22:08.291
I guess our attacker
had a lot of choices.

456
00:22:08.333 --> 00:22:09.625
Yeah. we'll send them
to the lab.

457
00:22:09.667 --> 00:22:11.166
but just an eyeball test none
of them match the marks

458
00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:12.583
on her neck.

459
00:22:21.333 --> 00:22:23.166
[digging]

460
00:22:40.375 --> 00:22:42.125
This catalogues every costume.

461
00:22:42.208 --> 00:22:45.000
every accessory down
to the smallest button.

462
00:22:45.083 --> 00:22:45.667
May I?

463
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:46.834
Please.

464
00:22:46.917 --> 00:22:48.333
Sam: Were they all in
this room until showtime?

465
00:22:48.417 --> 00:22:51.834
Uh. no. I had a hard time
keeping track of them. actually.

466
00:22:51.917 --> 00:22:53.875
Where were you when
Miss Griffin returned here?

467
00:22:53.959 --> 00:22:58.208
Uh. I was upstairs fixing a seam
on one of the actor's jackets

468
00:22:58.291 --> 00:22:59.125
before he went on stage.

469
00:22:59.208 --> 00:23:00.208
Oh.

470
00:23:00.291 --> 00:23:01.375
Which actor?

471
00:23:01.458 --> 00:23:03.834
- Kevin Trudeau.
- Kevin Trudeau.

472
00:23:03.917 --> 00:23:05.792
Sam. take a look at this.

473
00:23:05.875 --> 00:23:08.041
That's the constable's belt.

474
00:23:08.125 --> 00:23:09.333
Where is it now?

475
00:23:09.417 --> 00:23:12.041
Uh. I would imagine
with the actor.

476
00:23:12.125 --> 00:23:13.709
They were all wearing
their costumes

477
00:23:13.792 --> 00:23:14.834
when the police sent them home.

478
00:23:14.917 --> 00:23:16.917
So we'll find that belt
with the constable?

479
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.041
You should.

480
00:23:18.125 --> 00:23:19.208
He got a name?

481
00:23:19.333 --> 00:23:21.375
Roger Giles.

482
00:23:22.542 --> 00:23:24.458
[clock ticking loudly]

483
00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:36.125
Is it normally that loud?

484
00:23:36.208 --> 00:23:36.709
What?

485
00:23:36.792 --> 00:23:37.834
The clock.

486
00:23:42.083 --> 00:23:42.875
I hadn't noticed.

487
00:23:42.917 --> 00:23:43.959
No.

488
00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:46.667
It's loud.

489
00:23:49.083 --> 00:23:50.542
Do you recognize this belt?

490
00:23:50.625 --> 00:23:51.625
Uh. yeah. it's mine.

491
00:23:51.709 --> 00:23:52.625
Oh.

492
00:23:52.709 --> 00:23:54.125
Uh. no-not mine.
it's the constable's.

493
00:23:54.208 --> 00:23:54.959
The constable's?

494
00:23:55.041 --> 00:23:57.166
My character in the play. yeah.

495
00:23:58.667 --> 00:24:01.000
Where is this belt right now?

496
00:24:01.083 --> 00:24:02.208
I don't know.

497
00:24:02.291 --> 00:24:03.667
Was it in your possession
when you left the theatre?

498
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:05.000
No.

499
00:24:05.083 --> 00:24:06.333
They told us that all the actors
went home in their costumes.

500
00:24:06.417 --> 00:24:07.250
Yeah. they did.

501
00:24:07.291 --> 00:24:08.709
No. I-I wasn't in costume.

502
00:24:08.792 --> 00:24:12.125
My character doesn't appear
until the second act.

503
00:24:12.208 --> 00:24:13.583
You-you saw me.

504
00:24:13.667 --> 00:24:16.000
I was just in a t-shirt
and jeans.

505
00:24:16.083 --> 00:24:17.000
No belt?

506
00:24:17.083 --> 00:24:18.000
No belt. no.

507
00:24:18.083 --> 00:24:19.333
Was the costume in
your dressing room?

508
00:24:19.417 --> 00:24:22.166
Oh. no. I have six lines.

509
00:24:24.959 --> 00:24:27.166
I didn't-I didn't get
a dressing room.

510
00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:29.000
It was with the other costumes.

511
00:24:29.083 --> 00:24:30.333
Ok.

512
00:24:30.792 --> 00:24:32.417
Where were you when
the play began?

513
00:24:32.458 --> 00:24:33.375
With the other cast.

514
00:24:33.458 --> 00:24:34.500
And can they confirm that?

515
00:24:34.583 --> 00:24:36.667
Well... yeah. I think so.

516
00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:37.583
You think so?

517
00:24:37.625 --> 00:24:40.083
The whole night
is kind of a blur.

518
00:24:40.125 --> 00:24:41.166
Yeah.

519
00:24:46.458 --> 00:24:48.625
[clock ticks loudly]

520
00:24:59.458 --> 00:25:01.208
[door opens]

521
00:25:01.291 --> 00:25:02.291
Sara.

522
00:25:02.333 --> 00:25:03.291
Hi.

523
00:25:03.333 --> 00:25:04.709
I'm so sorry. did we have
an appointment?

524
00:25:04.792 --> 00:25:05.709
Uh. no.

525
00:25:05.792 --> 00:25:08.125
Uh. I was just hoping
to speak with you.

526
00:25:08.166 --> 00:25:09.417
Uh. do you have a minute?

527
00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:12.083
- Yes. yes. Please take a seat.
- Thank you.

528
00:25:14.333 --> 00:25:15.125
[sighs]

529
00:25:15.166 --> 00:25:16.917
This is embarrassing. uh...

530
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.750
I know that Neil and I agreed
to pay you

531
00:25:18.834 --> 00:25:21.000
for the wonderful work
you've done on our playbill.

532
00:25:21.083 --> 00:25:22.166
and we will.

533
00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:24.709
I was just hoping that we could
get another month.

534
00:25:24.792 --> 00:25:26.166
Yes. of course.

535
00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:28.125
Thank you.

536
00:25:28.166 --> 00:25:31.417
It's just... Neil took out
a second mortgage on our home

537
00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.291
to fund the play and now
with no future performances

538
00:25:34.375 --> 00:25:39.291
we have no hope of recouping
those expenses.

539
00:25:39.375 --> 00:25:41.834
I am so sorry.

540
00:25:41.875 --> 00:25:44.250
Did Neil not have insurance?

541
00:25:44.333 --> 00:25:50.083
He did. it covered some.
but there were other debts.

542
00:25:50.166 --> 00:25:52.333
You know. with a name
like Neil Kahn.

543
00:25:52.417 --> 00:25:54.333
I would assume he would have
investors lined up

544
00:25:54.417 --> 00:25:55.667
around the block.

545
00:25:55.709 --> 00:25:56.667
I know.

546
00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:58.834
His first two plays
were very well-received.

547
00:25:58.917 --> 00:26:01.125
both critical and commercial
hits.

548
00:26:01.208 --> 00:26:04.333
But he's never been able
to repeat that success.

549
00:26:04.375 --> 00:26:05.875
His last show lost
a lot of money.

550
00:26:05.959 --> 00:26:07.542
it really shook his confidence.

551
00:26:07.625 --> 00:26:10.333
We were hoping that
this production

552
00:26:10.417 --> 00:26:11.542
would turn that luck around.

553
00:26:11.625 --> 00:26:14.917
Allie. he's talking about
walking away.

554
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.083
Starting fresh somewhere new.

555
00:26:18.208 --> 00:26:19.542
Neil wants to leave town?

556
00:26:19.625 --> 00:26:21.875
He's already spoken
to a realtor.

557
00:26:21.959 --> 00:26:24.083
Doesn't that seem a little fast?

558
00:26:24.166 --> 00:26:27.250
Maybe it's for the best.

559
00:26:27.333 --> 00:26:28.500
Is that Roger Giles?

560
00:26:28.583 --> 00:26:31.750
Oh. yes. Sorry. I was just
organizing photos.

561
00:26:31.834 --> 00:26:35.875
Um. actually. I heard
from some cast members

562
00:26:35.917 --> 00:26:39.208
that there was an incident
between Roger and Cassandra.

563
00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:41.750
Do you know what that
may have been about?

564
00:26:41.834 --> 00:26:43.625
No.

565
00:26:43.709 --> 00:26:46.750
But about a week before the show
Cassandra asked Neil

566
00:26:46.834 --> 00:26:49.375
to cut Roger from the play.

567
00:26:49.417 --> 00:26:50.709
But he didn't.

568
00:26:50.792 --> 00:26:54.417
It was too close
to opening night.

569
00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.417
In hindsight...

570
00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:00.917
that might have spared us
all this heartache.

571
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.250
Why is that?

572
00:27:02.375 --> 00:27:03.417
You didn't hear?

573
00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:06.375
The murder weapon was
Roger's belt.

574
00:27:08.625 --> 00:27:15.667
[clock ticks loudly]

575
00:27:23.917 --> 00:27:26.375
Can't hold him much longer.

576
00:27:26.458 --> 00:27:27.417
Won't need to.

577
00:27:27.458 --> 00:27:30.417
Another hour in there
and he'll talk.

578
00:27:30.458 --> 00:27:33.166
But will he have anything
worthwhile to say?

579
00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:34.583
He better.

580
00:27:34.625 --> 00:27:36.083
Victim was choked with his belt.

581
00:27:36.125 --> 00:27:37.500
We got it yet?

582
00:27:37.583 --> 00:27:40.083
Working on a search warrant
for his apartment.

583
00:27:40.125 --> 00:27:41.417
Ok.

584
00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.166
Hey. Sam.

585
00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:47.375
What's this?

586
00:27:47.458 --> 00:27:49.166
I was following up with
a robbery from last week.

587
00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:50.125
Oh. the bakery on Main?

588
00:27:50.166 --> 00:27:51.166
Yeah.

589
00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:52.458
Anything on the security feed?

590
00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.709
Uh. two guys. masks.

591
00:27:54.792 --> 00:27:56.041
That's the third one this month.

592
00:27:56.125 --> 00:27:57.125
Yeah.

593
00:27:57.166 --> 00:27:58.041
Doughnuts?

594
00:27:58.125 --> 00:27:59.291
A little cliché.
don't you think?

595
00:27:59.375 --> 00:28:01.458
No. these are crullers.
Delicious.

596
00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:02.667
Sure.

597
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:05.917
Detective Acosta.

598
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:06.792
[sighs]

599
00:28:06.875 --> 00:28:08.166
Any update on
the Griffin murder.

600
00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:09.583
No comment. Excuse me.

601
00:28:09.667 --> 00:28:12.750
Are you gonna be naming a person
of interest in the case. or...?

602
00:28:12.834 --> 00:28:15.709
Come on. man. You gotta
give me something here.

603
00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:19.917
Enjoy.

604
00:28:22.166 --> 00:28:23.458
[sighs]

605
00:28:26.625 --> 00:28:27.834
Right here.

606
00:28:27.917 --> 00:28:29.125
Oh. perfect.

607
00:28:29.208 --> 00:28:31.833
I'm gonna have these contacts
sent over to you tomorrow.

608
00:28:31.834 --> 00:28:33.166
I really gotta
show you something.

609
00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:34.250
Yeah.

610
00:28:34.333 --> 00:28:36.291
Just give me one second.
I'll be right back.

611
00:28:36.375 --> 00:28:37.750
I was printing out
the Bakers' wedding

612
00:28:37.834 --> 00:28:40.000
and I found these
in the SD card.

613
00:28:40.083 --> 00:28:41.959
taken the night of the murder.

614
00:28:42.041 --> 00:28:44.583
I thought we gave everything
to the police.

615
00:28:44.667 --> 00:28:46.291
Must have missed one.

616
00:29:04.125 --> 00:29:04.875
Hey. Sam.

617
00:29:04.959 --> 00:29:05.667
- Hi.
- Hi.

618
00:29:05.709 --> 00:29:07.709
You might wanna see this.

619
00:29:07.792 --> 00:29:09.583
Twenty minutes before
the murder.

620
00:29:09.667 --> 00:29:12.291
That's Kevin Trudeau
with the missing belt.

621
00:29:12.375 --> 00:29:14.125
You're welcome.

622
00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:24.875
I already told you everything
I know.

623
00:29:24.917 --> 00:29:27.583
I think you might have left out
a detail or two.

624
00:29:27.667 --> 00:29:29.959
What's in your hand?

625
00:29:31.834 --> 00:29:33.125
A belt.

626
00:29:33.208 --> 00:29:34.250
A belt?

627
00:29:34.333 --> 00:29:35.709
There's only one character
with a belt like that.

628
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:36.959
And it wasn't you.

629
00:29:37.041 --> 00:29:40.375
It got mixed in with my costume.
I was taking it to Sara.

630
00:29:40.458 --> 00:29:43.542
Oh. so you took it to Sara.
She'll confirm that story?

631
00:29:43.583 --> 00:29:44.709
She wasn't there.

632
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:46.583
I left it next to some of
the other costumes.

633
00:29:46.667 --> 00:29:47.750
Oh. she wasn't there?

634
00:29:47.834 --> 00:29:51.166
A cast member noted that
you were late for a cue.

635
00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:53.125
Where were you?

636
00:29:53.208 --> 00:29:55.542
I was a bit nervous. I wanted
to go over my lines.

637
00:29:55.625 --> 00:29:56.875
I lost track of time.

638
00:29:56.959 --> 00:29:59.417
Were you running the lines
with one of the other actors?

639
00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.250
No. Alone.

640
00:30:01.333 --> 00:30:02.333
Alone.

641
00:30:02.417 --> 00:30:05.625
So there's no one to corroborate
your story.

642
00:30:08.417 --> 00:30:09.667
No.

643
00:30:13.333 --> 00:30:14.667
So what do you think?

644
00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:17.750
Twenty minutes is a big window.
He could have dropped it off.

645
00:30:17.792 --> 00:30:19.750
Or he could have hung onto it.

646
00:30:19.792 --> 00:30:22.041
We had to let Roger Giles walk.

647
00:30:22.125 --> 00:30:25.709
The search on his apartment
came back clean.

648
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Ok.

649
00:30:36.208 --> 00:30:37.458
Oh. too bad.

650
00:30:39.041 --> 00:30:40.667
[message alert]

651
00:30:54.041 --> 00:30:55.500
Lucky shot.

652
00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.208
Who's next?

653
00:31:04.667 --> 00:31:07.750
Um. I could try.

654
00:31:07.834 --> 00:31:09.458
It's 50.

655
00:31:09.542 --> 00:31:11.375
Dollars?

656
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.542
Um... ok. so I just use
this stick right here?

657
00:31:19.625 --> 00:31:21.333
Did I say 50?

658
00:31:21.417 --> 00:31:23.792
I meant 75.

659
00:31:27.041 --> 00:31:28.625
Rack 'em.

660
00:31:37.709 --> 00:31:39.875
[applause]

661
00:31:45.458 --> 00:31:47.333
[applause]

662
00:31:47.709 --> 00:31:49.125
Lucky shot.

663
00:31:50.208 --> 00:31:52.083
Ok. one more.

664
00:31:58.250 --> 00:31:59.291
- Hi.
- Hi.

665
00:32:06.208 --> 00:32:07.041
Hey!

666
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:09.250
Oh. tough break.

667
00:32:09.333 --> 00:32:10.208
No. you cheated.

668
00:32:10.291 --> 00:32:11.250
Daniel: Hey. hey. hey.
We should go.

669
00:32:11.333 --> 00:32:12.125
Daniel! No!

670
00:32:12.208 --> 00:32:13.333
Did you see what he just did?

671
00:32:13.417 --> 00:32:13.917
Allie...

672
00:32:14.041 --> 00:32:16.375
Yes. Daniel.

673
00:32:16.417 --> 00:32:18.041
What'd you see?

674
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:22.208
Well. you know what?
I'm afraid I missed it.

675
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:23.709
Let's go.

676
00:32:23.792 --> 00:32:24.709
Uh. our food is getting cold.

677
00:32:24.792 --> 00:32:26.291
We didn't order food.

678
00:32:26.375 --> 00:32:26.875
Yeah.

679
00:32:26.917 --> 00:32:28.458
[clears throat]

680
00:32:29.208 --> 00:32:30.125
Do you know who that is?

681
00:32:30.208 --> 00:32:31.083
Yeah. a cheater.

682
00:32:31.166 --> 00:32:32.625
That's Tony Mac.

683
00:32:32.709 --> 00:32:35.542
Trust me when I say you
don't wanna be on his radar.

684
00:32:35.583 --> 00:32:37.208
Well. I've photographed
everyone in this town

685
00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:38.750
and I have no idea
who that guy is.

686
00:32:38.834 --> 00:32:40.208
Yeah. well he's not exactly
the type

687
00:32:40.291 --> 00:32:42.458
that likes his picture taken.

688
00:32:50.375 --> 00:32:53.125
Can I uh. get you something
to drink?

689
00:32:58.500 --> 00:32:59.959
Allie?

690
00:33:00.041 --> 00:33:03.083
Uh. I will have
another ginger ale.

691
00:33:03.125 --> 00:33:06.166
I'm gonna have a stout.
Whatever's on tap.

692
00:33:08.709 --> 00:33:10.875
You know. a lot of the cast
was at Neil's the other day

693
00:33:10.959 --> 00:33:12.583
but I didn't see you there.

694
00:33:12.625 --> 00:33:16.333
Yeah. well uh. I had
somewhere to be.

695
00:33:20.625 --> 00:33:22.917
He flinched when he saw you.

696
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.208
It was subtle. but...

697
00:33:24.291 --> 00:33:25.542
You knew he'd be here.

698
00:33:25.625 --> 00:33:28.917
Yeah. that's why I picked
this place.

699
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.166
So you invited me here
for a story?

700
00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:34.000
Well. not just a story.

701
00:33:34.083 --> 00:33:37.917
I thought it was the perfect
excuse to see you again.

702
00:33:37.959 --> 00:33:39.750
Ok. you know what. Daniel...

703
00:33:40.875 --> 00:33:42.000
Neil?

704
00:33:42.083 --> 00:33:43.917
What is he doing here?

705
00:33:44.041 --> 00:33:46.709
There are only two reasons
you talk to Tony Mac.

706
00:33:46.792 --> 00:33:51.375
To borrow money
or to place a bet.

707
00:33:51.458 --> 00:33:53.250
Is this off the record?

708
00:33:53.333 --> 00:33:55.000
Sure.

709
00:33:55.083 --> 00:33:56.041
Neil is broke.

710
00:33:56.125 --> 00:33:57.500
He sunk every penny he had
into that play.

711
00:33:57.583 --> 00:34:00.625
He even had to borrow money
to finance it.

712
00:34:01.208 --> 00:34:04.500
Are you sure he got that money
from a bank?

713
00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:07.333
Get outta here now!

714
00:34:28.166 --> 00:34:30.250
Can I take my break?

715
00:34:39.709 --> 00:34:41.709
I'm just down the street.

716
00:34:41.792 --> 00:34:43.709
Yeah. I'm that way.

717
00:34:45.875 --> 00:34:47.959
Ok. well thank you
for the drinks.

718
00:34:48.041 --> 00:34:49.834
Sure. yeah. yeah.

719
00:34:49.917 --> 00:34:52.291
Maybe we can do it
again sometime.

720
00:34:52.375 --> 00:34:54.667
Surveillance optional.

721
00:35:03.291 --> 00:35:05.250
[footsteps approaching]

722
00:35:15.083 --> 00:35:17.792
[screams]

723
00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:19.834
Ahhhh!

724
00:35:39.458 --> 00:35:40.208
Hey.

725
00:35:40.291 --> 00:35:41.041
Here you go.

726
00:35:41.125 --> 00:35:42.375
Thank you.

727
00:35:42.417 --> 00:35:45.250
Ok. well we have officers
searching the area

728
00:35:45.333 --> 00:35:47.208
and we're gonna check all
the security camera footage

729
00:35:47.291 --> 00:35:48.917
form nearby businesses.

730
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000
Hopefully get something
from there.

731
00:35:51.083 --> 00:35:51.792
Thanks.

732
00:35:51.875 --> 00:35:52.709
Yeah.

733
00:35:53.583 --> 00:35:55.542
Hey. did he hurt you?

734
00:35:55.625 --> 00:35:57.417
Not as much as I hurt him.

735
00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:00.417
I scratched his arm
pretty badly.

736
00:36:00.458 --> 00:36:04.291
I can't understand. though. why
he didn't try to steal my purse

737
00:36:04.375 --> 00:36:06.083
or anything.

738
00:36:08.458 --> 00:36:09.959
What?

739
00:36:10.041 --> 00:36:12.208
What if he wasn't after
your purse?

740
00:36:12.291 --> 00:36:14.250
What if he was after you?

741
00:36:14.291 --> 00:36:15.166
What?

742
00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:16.750
You witnessed a murder
two days ago.

743
00:36:16.834 --> 00:36:17.917
What if there's somebody
out there

744
00:36:17.959 --> 00:36:20.583
who thinks that you can
identify him?

745
00:36:20.625 --> 00:36:22.250
It was so dark in
the costume room.

746
00:36:22.291 --> 00:36:25.041
How would anyone know it was me?

747
00:36:26.542 --> 00:36:28.083
My pass.

748
00:36:28.125 --> 00:36:29.542
My back stage pass.

749
00:36:29.625 --> 00:36:33.875
I lost it that night and it has
a picture of me on it.

750
00:36:33.959 --> 00:36:35.625
and my name...

751
00:36:35.709 --> 00:36:38.083
what if I dropped it
in the costume room?

752
00:36:38.125 --> 00:36:40.417
I'm gonna have someone
outside your house.

753
00:36:40.458 --> 00:36:41.458
You'll be safe.

754
00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.208
No. uh. no. You don't have
to do that.

755
00:36:44.291 --> 00:36:45.458
Allie. come on.

756
00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.959
Look. Sam. I appreciate
everything you're trying to do

757
00:36:48.041 --> 00:36:50.041
but I don't need a police detail

758
00:36:50.125 --> 00:36:52.458
and I certainly don't need
a bodyguard.

759
00:36:52.542 --> 00:36:57.375
What I need is a very long
and very hot shower.

760
00:36:57.458 --> 00:36:58.875
And to unpack.

761
00:36:58.959 --> 00:37:01.542
I'm still unpacking
from the move.

762
00:37:01.625 --> 00:37:07.625
Yeah. your uh. your new place.
it's um... I like it.

763
00:37:07.709 --> 00:37:09.291
It's you.

764
00:37:09.333 --> 00:37:10.417
Thank you.

765
00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:11.500
Yeah.

766
00:37:13.667 --> 00:37:16.875
If anything happens
I will call you.

767
00:37:16.959 --> 00:37:18.792
Promise?

768
00:37:18.834 --> 00:37:20.375
Yes. I promise.

769
00:37:20.458 --> 00:37:21.750
Ok.

770
00:37:25.291 --> 00:37:26.875
See you later.

771
00:37:26.959 --> 00:37:28.250
Bye.

772
00:37:31.542 --> 00:37:34.000
Lock your door!

773
00:37:34.083 --> 00:37:35.959
Thank you!

774
00:38:45.875 --> 00:38:48.208
[phone ringing]

775
00:38:48.291 --> 00:38:49.792
Are you ok? I'm coming
right now!

776
00:38:49.875 --> 00:38:51.834
Sam. I'm out of syrup.

777
00:38:51.917 --> 00:38:53.959
And I figured. since you were
right outside.

778
00:38:54.083 --> 00:38:55.583
you could ask my neighbour.
Mrs. Handler.

779
00:38:55.667 --> 00:38:58.917
if I could borrow some.
Green house on the left.

780
00:38:58.959 --> 00:39:00.500
Oh. and thank you.

781
00:39:00.583 --> 00:39:01.834
Good morning.

782
00:39:02.625 --> 00:39:04.083
[sighs]

783
00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:08.834
[doorbell rings]

784
00:39:08.917 --> 00:39:10.250
Come in!

785
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:14.583
Hey.

786
00:39:14.625 --> 00:39:15.583
Hi.

787
00:39:15.667 --> 00:39:17.542
She said that this doesn't make
you guys even.

788
00:39:17.625 --> 00:39:20.917
Uh. she still owes you for some
portraits or something.

789
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000
Sit down.

790
00:39:22.083 --> 00:39:24.250
I shot her Christmas card
last year.

791
00:39:24.333 --> 00:39:26.875
I let her pay me back
in gingerbread.

792
00:39:27.625 --> 00:39:28.625
Huh.

793
00:39:29.458 --> 00:39:31.417
What's... what's all this?

794
00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:32.792
Breakfast.

795
00:39:32.875 --> 00:39:35.750
I figured you hadn't eaten since
you sat in your car all night

796
00:39:35.834 --> 00:39:38.000
instead of going home
like I asked.

797
00:39:40.667 --> 00:39:41.291
Syrup.

798
00:39:41.375 --> 00:39:42.500
Oh. no thank you.

799
00:39:42.583 --> 00:39:44.417
I don't do syrup.

800
00:39:47.625 --> 00:39:50.375
So are you planning on going
anywhere today?

801
00:39:50.458 --> 00:39:51.166
Why?

802
00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:52.375
Are you gonna call ahead

803
00:39:52.458 --> 00:39:54.625
and see if there's any nearby
parking available?

804
00:39:54.667 --> 00:39:57.834
I just think maybe you should
lay low for a while.

805
00:39:57.917 --> 00:39:59.125
I have work.

806
00:39:59.166 --> 00:40:02.125
Allie. someone tried to hurt you
last night.

807
00:40:03.125 --> 00:40:06.625
Look. if anything happens
I have Noah to protect me.

808
00:40:10.333 --> 00:40:12.208
Yeah. that's very comforting.

809
00:40:12.291 --> 00:40:13.375
What do you want me to do?

810
00:40:13.458 --> 00:40:15.792
Just stop my life because of
one crazy person?

811
00:40:15.875 --> 00:40:16.542
Yeah.

812
00:40:16.625 --> 00:40:18.959
No. I'm not gonna do that.

813
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.750
Ok. just be careful.

814
00:40:20.834 --> 00:40:21.458
Please.

815
00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:23.375
Yes. Ok. Detective.

816
00:40:23.458 --> 00:40:25.583
- Hey.
- Hey.

817
00:40:25.667 --> 00:40:28.834
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

818
00:40:28.917 --> 00:40:32.667
So. that was Sam.

819
00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:34.792
Did you bring the supplies?

820
00:40:34.875 --> 00:40:37.458
As a matter of fact. I did.

821
00:40:37.542 --> 00:40:40.750
Supplies for what. exactly?

822
00:40:42.041 --> 00:40:43.959
Ok. here is what we know.

823
00:40:44.041 --> 00:40:46.333
Cassandra was murdered five
minutes before she was supposed

824
00:40:46.417 --> 00:40:49.375
to take stage and everyone
on this board had access

825
00:40:49.458 --> 00:40:50.542
to the costume room.

826
00:40:50.625 --> 00:40:53.333
But do they have motives
for murder?

827
00:40:53.375 --> 00:40:54.750
To be determined.

828
00:40:54.834 --> 00:40:57.333
So. where do we start?

829
00:40:57.375 --> 00:40:58.333
Sally Winestock.

830
00:40:58.417 --> 00:41:00.166
Who's that? Does she play
the governess?

831
00:41:00.208 --> 00:41:01.333
Uh. nope.

832
00:41:01.375 --> 00:41:03.792
She's got a 9:15 appointment
for a passport photo.

833
00:41:03.875 --> 00:41:05.208
Yes. I work here.

834
00:41:05.291 --> 00:41:06.583
Ok. do me a favor.

835
00:41:06.667 --> 00:41:08.333
Go through the board and pin
anyone you think may have wanted

836
00:41:08.417 --> 00:41:09.542
to hurt Cassandra.

837
00:41:09.667 --> 00:41:11.709
Also. they recorded the
auditions and rehearsals.

838
00:41:11.792 --> 00:41:13.917
Can you call the stage manager
and get that footage?

839
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:14.709
Kenny Kwan?

840
00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:15.542
Yes.

841
00:41:15.625 --> 00:41:17.083
You got it.

842
00:41:22.166 --> 00:41:24.583
Ok. here's everything
from the last three months.

843
00:41:24.667 --> 00:41:29.959
Auditions. rehearsals. all of
my casting notes. everything.

844
00:41:30.041 --> 00:41:31.792
Wow.

845
00:41:31.875 --> 00:41:32.959
Very thorough.

846
00:41:33.041 --> 00:41:34.500
Well. I know that the smallest
piece of evidence

847
00:41:34.583 --> 00:41:37.625
can turn an investigation
on its head.

848
00:41:37.709 --> 00:41:39.417
"How to Get Away with Murder"?

849
00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:44.625
That's uh. that's research
for my play.

850
00:41:44.709 --> 00:41:46.041
"Forensic Entomology".

851
00:41:46.083 --> 00:41:47.875
a "Guide to Collecting Evidence".

852
00:41:47.959 --> 00:41:51.041
"101 Crime Scenes".
that's a personal favorite.

853
00:41:51.083 --> 00:41:52.542
Oh. Quite the collection.

854
00:41:52.583 --> 00:41:53.667
Well. if you think that's bad

855
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:55.375
you should see my internet
search history.

856
00:41:55.458 --> 00:41:57.208
[laughs]

857
00:41:58.709 --> 00:42:02.417
Um. is there anything else I-
I can do?

858
00:42:02.458 --> 00:42:04.458
Actually. uh. yeah.

859
00:42:04.542 --> 00:42:06.959
Why don't you tell us
about Cassandra?

860
00:42:07.041 --> 00:42:09.250
Was she well-liked?

861
00:42:09.291 --> 00:42:11.166
Uh. yes. Very.

862
00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:13.625
Any dust-ups with
the old cast and crew?

863
00:42:13.709 --> 00:42:16.250
Well. there was one incident.

864
00:42:16.291 --> 00:42:19.834
but I'm not sure it even
merits mentioning.

865
00:42:19.917 --> 00:42:21.709
Maybe you let us be the judge
of that.

866
00:42:21.792 --> 00:42:22.875
Yeah.

867
00:42:22.959 --> 00:42:24.500
Well. shortly after
rehearsals started.

868
00:42:24.583 --> 00:42:27.417
Cassandra approached me
about one of her cast mates.

869
00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:28.500
Roger Giles.

870
00:42:28.583 --> 00:42:32.291
She said he was making her...
uncomfortable.

871
00:42:32.375 --> 00:42:33.125
Uncomfortable?

872
00:42:33.208 --> 00:42:35.083
Uncomfortable how?

873
00:42:35.166 --> 00:42:38.750
Uh. he would run into her
outside of rehearsals.

874
00:42:38.834 --> 00:42:41.625
in her mind. far too frequently
to be coincidental.

875
00:42:41.709 --> 00:42:43.208
So. what. he was following her?

876
00:42:43.291 --> 00:42:44.000
Mm.

877
00:42:44.083 --> 00:42:44.959
Was she afraid of him?

878
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.375
More concerned.

879
00:42:46.458 --> 00:42:48.208
- Ok.
- Ok.

880
00:42:48.291 --> 00:42:50.875
Did you ever do anything
about it?

881
00:42:50.959 --> 00:42:52.208
Well. sure I spoke to him

882
00:42:52.291 --> 00:42:53.625
but he swore it was innocent.

883
00:42:53.667 --> 00:42:57.333
It didn't feel right to judge
him unfairly on so little.

884
00:42:57.417 --> 00:42:58.750
Hmm.

885
00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:03.375
Maybe I should have trusted
Cassandra's instincts.

886
00:43:03.458 --> 00:43:05.166
Maybe you should have.

887
00:43:08.208 --> 00:43:10.208
Roger Giles has a history
with Cassandra.

888
00:43:10.291 --> 00:43:14.875
some kind of bad blood. and
his belt was the murder weapon.

889
00:43:14.959 --> 00:43:16.125
Kevin Trudeau.

890
00:43:16.166 --> 00:43:19.667
He was last seen with that
very belt before the show.

891
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:21.000
Allie: Then Neil Kahn.

892
00:43:21.083 --> 00:43:22.208
Noah: The director?

893
00:43:22.291 --> 00:43:23.917
Yeah. I saw him arguing
with his wife.

894
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.375
She seemed to think he was
hiding something from her.

895
00:43:26.458 --> 00:43:28.500
He looks too mild mannered.

896
00:43:28.583 --> 00:43:31.000
Looks can be deceiving.

897
00:43:31.041 --> 00:43:32.500
He wears a bowtie.

898
00:43:32.542 --> 00:43:34.166
He had a lot riding
on that play.

899
00:43:34.208 --> 00:43:37.375
I mean. would he really ruin
his opening night?

900
00:43:37.458 --> 00:43:39.000
Maybe not.

901
00:43:39.083 --> 00:43:41.417
Well. these were taken a week
before the murder.

902
00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:43.792
Not sure what you're
looking for.

903
00:43:43.875 --> 00:43:44.875
Hmm.

904
00:44:00.125 --> 00:44:00.709
Great.

905
00:44:00.792 --> 00:44:01.709
Thanks. May.

906
00:44:01.792 --> 00:44:04.166
Ok. Mike Tremont ordered
a dozen roses

907
00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:07.375
to Cassandra's dressing room
the day I shot those photos.

908
00:44:07.458 --> 00:44:09.125
Uh. who's Mike Tremont?

909
00:44:09.208 --> 00:44:10.125
Her boyfriend?

910
00:44:10.208 --> 00:44:12.000
Mmm. if his flowers
were in the trash

911
00:44:12.083 --> 00:44:13.625
I'd put an "ex"
in front of that.

912
00:44:13.709 --> 00:44:15.291
Found him.

913
00:44:15.375 --> 00:44:16.542
Is there a home address?

914
00:44:16.625 --> 00:44:19.542
No. but his social media profile
does say that he works

915
00:44:19.583 --> 00:44:21.208
as a security guard.

916
00:44:21.291 --> 00:44:22.125
[gasps]

917
00:44:22.208 --> 00:44:23.667
Ooh. look where.

918
00:44:25.834 --> 00:44:26.917
Yeah. no. I just checked.

919
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.792
He's worked here six months.
mostly day shifts.

920
00:44:28.875 --> 00:44:30.125
So he's there now?

921
00:44:30.208 --> 00:44:32.041
Is there any way you can get
me in there to talk to him?

922
00:44:32.125 --> 00:44:33.375
Well. no can do.

923
00:44:33.417 --> 00:44:34.583
Why not?

924
00:44:34.667 --> 00:44:38.583
The police just escorted him
out of the building.

925
00:44:47.458 --> 00:44:48.625
I wasn't at the theatre
that night.

926
00:44:48.709 --> 00:44:49.709
I was working.

927
00:44:49.792 --> 00:44:51.458
Can anyone confirm that?

928
00:44:51.542 --> 00:44:53.750
The security company.
They'll have my schedule.

929
00:44:53.792 --> 00:44:55.792
You normally work nights?

930
00:44:55.875 --> 00:44:57.250
Times are tight.

931
00:44:57.333 --> 00:44:59.083
I've been picking up
extra shifts.

932
00:44:59.166 --> 00:45:02.083
What was your relationship
with Cassandra Griffin?

933
00:45:02.166 --> 00:45:03.417
We don't have a relationship.

934
00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:05.250
But you did. at some point.

935
00:45:05.291 --> 00:45:07.917
We dated for a little while.
It wasn't serious.

936
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.750
But you bought her flowers.

937
00:45:09.834 --> 00:45:11.083
It wasn't serious for her.

938
00:45:11.166 --> 00:45:12.875
You seem angry about that.

939
00:45:12.959 --> 00:45:15.041
When was the last time you spoke
with Miss Griffin?

940
00:45:15.125 --> 00:45:16.333
About a week ago.

941
00:45:16.417 --> 00:45:17.750
She stopped returning
my phone calls.

942
00:45:17.792 --> 00:45:20.333
I thought maybe the flowers
would help.

943
00:45:20.417 --> 00:45:22.125
They didn't.

944
00:45:22.208 --> 00:45:23.166
You get in a fight?

945
00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:24.250
No.

946
00:45:24.291 --> 00:45:27.083
She just said her heart
wasn't in it anymore.

947
00:45:27.125 --> 00:45:28.625
Wow.

948
00:45:28.709 --> 00:45:29.750
Must have hurt.

949
00:45:29.834 --> 00:45:31.500
Yeah. that must have hurt.

950
00:45:31.583 --> 00:45:33.583
I'm over it.

951
00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:38.417
It just wasn't meant to be.

952
00:45:43.959 --> 00:45:45.959
Oh. hey. I want you guys
to watch something.

953
00:45:46.041 --> 00:45:47.291
That is my laptop.

954
00:45:47.333 --> 00:45:49.041
Yeah. Mine's at my apartment.

955
00:45:49.125 --> 00:45:50.667
Yeah. but it's password
protected.

956
00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:51.625
I guessed it.

957
00:45:51.709 --> 00:45:52.625
It's the same as your phone.

958
00:45:52.667 --> 00:45:53.959
Wait. you know my phone
password?!

959
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.083
What? We're all friends here.

960
00:45:57.166 --> 00:45:59.125
Ok. what did you want
to show us?

961
00:45:59.208 --> 00:46:02.083
I think I found our next lead.

962
00:46:02.166 --> 00:46:03.166
Laura?

963
00:46:03.250 --> 00:46:05.667
She was desperate to win
the lead role.

964
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:06.917
So were you.

965
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.208
I really think I could have
brought something to it.

966
00:46:09.291 --> 00:46:11.917
But you said you were attacked
by a guy.

967
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.959
Uh. she could have
hired someone.

968
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.625
With her tips from the bakery?

969
00:46:15.709 --> 00:46:18.125
She constantly complained
about working at the bakery

970
00:46:18.166 --> 00:46:20.625
and how the play could be
her ticket out.

971
00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:22.542
Honestly. it just seems
like a stretch.

972
00:46:22.625 --> 00:46:26.250
Ok. but watch this.

973
00:46:26.333 --> 00:46:29.333
Neil: Tell me why you are
perfect for this role.

974
00:46:29.417 --> 00:46:33.750
When I read the play
it truly spoke to me.

975
00:46:33.834 --> 00:46:37.166
I have never related
to a character more.

976
00:46:37.208 --> 00:46:40.125
I would kill for this role.

977
00:46:49.959 --> 00:46:51.458
It's a figure of speech.

978
00:46:51.542 --> 00:46:54.208
Ok. well where were you
when Cassandra died?

979
00:46:54.291 --> 00:46:55.291
Where were you?

980
00:46:55.375 --> 00:46:57.417
Oh. that's right. with the body.

981
00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:58.959
Touché.

982
00:46:59.041 --> 00:47:00.959
Look. I'm sorry she's dead.
I am.

983
00:47:01.041 --> 00:47:02.667
But I had nothing to do with it.

984
00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:05.667
Looks like we're not
the only ones on to you.

985
00:47:05.792 --> 00:47:07.792
The bakery was broken into
last week

986
00:47:07.875 --> 00:47:09.834
and they're still investigating.

987
00:47:09.917 --> 00:47:12.333
You need to leave.
You're gonna get me fired.

988
00:47:12.417 --> 00:47:14.125
Ok. just one last question.

989
00:47:14.208 --> 00:47:17.041
Did you ever meet someone
named Mike Tremont?

990
00:47:17.083 --> 00:47:18.041
Who?

991
00:47:18.125 --> 00:47:19.542
Cassandra's boyfriend?

992
00:47:19.625 --> 00:47:20.959
We think.

993
00:47:21.041 --> 00:47:22.250
No.

994
00:47:22.333 --> 00:47:23.709
And I'm not surprised she didn't
bring him around rehearsals.

995
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:24.542
Why?

996
00:47:24.583 --> 00:47:25.875
You didn't hear the rumours?

997
00:47:25.917 --> 00:47:29.417
She was sneaking around
with somebody from the play.

998
00:47:31.125 --> 00:47:31.917
Bye.

999
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.041
Thank you.

1000
00:47:36.458 --> 00:47:37.667
Dispatch: ...68 Maplewood.

1001
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:41.083
Repeat. all cars 1037
in progress. 68 Maplewood.

1002
00:47:41.166 --> 00:47:43.959
Copy that. Car 54 on my way.

1003
00:47:53.583 --> 00:47:55.041
Where are you?

1004
00:47:56.667 --> 00:47:57.750
Hey!

1005
00:47:57.834 --> 00:47:59.917
Looks like your ride
couldn't make it.

1006
00:47:59.959 --> 00:48:02.041
I'd be happy to give you a lift.

1007
00:48:04.041 --> 00:48:05.875
Seriously.

1008
00:48:30.291 --> 00:48:31.250
Come on.

1009
00:48:31.291 --> 00:48:32.834
Pick up. pick up. pick up.
Where are you?

1010
00:48:32.917 --> 00:48:34.667
Let's go.

1011
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:37.125
[panting]

1012
00:48:41.166 --> 00:48:43.542
Hey. bud.

1013
00:48:43.625 --> 00:48:45.375
I could do this all day.

1014
00:48:45.458 --> 00:48:47.250
Woah!

1015
00:48:47.333 --> 00:48:49.166
I don't really want to.

1016
00:48:52.834 --> 00:48:54.250
Come on.

1017
00:48:54.834 --> 00:48:56.291
Jim ate like 14 hot dogs.

1018
00:48:56.375 --> 00:48:57.959
I've never seen anything
like it.

1019
00:48:58.041 --> 00:48:59.125
It's crazy.

1020
00:48:59.166 --> 00:49:00.125
Oh. I'll catch you later.

1021
00:49:00.208 --> 00:49:01.542
He hit Carl Winter's house.

1022
00:49:01.625 --> 00:49:02.291
The baker?

1023
00:49:02.375 --> 00:49:03.208
Mmmhmm.

1024
00:49:03.291 --> 00:49:05.792
First his business.
then his home.

1025
00:49:05.834 --> 00:49:07.458
Sounds personal.

1026
00:49:07.542 --> 00:49:08.583
We get a name yet?

1027
00:49:08.667 --> 00:49:10.125
Still not talking.

1028
00:49:10.166 --> 00:49:11.667
He's covering for someone.

1029
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:12.917
The driver?

1030
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.291
Or whoever sprung for that
six-figure defence lawyer.

1031
00:49:15.333 --> 00:49:16.542
Hmm.

1032
00:49:20.875 --> 00:49:21.667
Thank you.

1033
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:23.250
I hope you guys love them.

1034
00:49:23.333 --> 00:49:24.583
Bye.

1035
00:49:27.041 --> 00:49:28.166
Oh. hi Megan.

1036
00:49:28.208 --> 00:49:29.333
Hi.

1037
00:49:29.417 --> 00:49:31.834
You guys are investigating
Cassandra's murder. right?

1038
00:49:31.917 --> 00:49:33.750
Oh. I-I wouldn't say
"investigating"...

1039
00:49:33.834 --> 00:49:35.041
Yes.

1040
00:49:35.125 --> 00:49:37.792
Well. I was boxing up Cass's
things to send to her parents

1041
00:49:37.875 --> 00:49:41.834
like they asked me
and I found something.

1042
00:49:41.917 --> 00:49:43.000
What kind of something?

1043
00:49:43.041 --> 00:49:44.500
Her day planner.

1044
00:49:44.542 --> 00:49:46.291
Cassandra was the type of person
who would bullet point

1045
00:49:46.375 --> 00:49:47.792
what she had for lunch.

1046
00:49:47.875 --> 00:49:48.750
Super organized.

1047
00:49:48.834 --> 00:49:51.834
Uh. do you have it?

1048
00:49:51.917 --> 00:49:53.709
I gave it to the police.

1049
00:49:53.792 --> 00:49:55.041
Oh.

1050
00:49:55.125 --> 00:49:57.834
After I made a copy.

1051
00:50:01.458 --> 00:50:03.166
Hot yoga.

1052
00:50:03.208 --> 00:50:05.542
Oh. I've been meaning
to try that.

1053
00:50:05.625 --> 00:50:07.458
Does she say what studio?

1054
00:50:07.542 --> 00:50:10.709
You know. I keep seeing the
letters KT on here once a week.

1055
00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:12.375
Does anybody know
what that stands for?

1056
00:50:12.458 --> 00:50:15.208
Keratin treatment?

1057
00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:16.458
Kevin Trudeau.

1058
00:50:16.542 --> 00:50:18.333
Cassandra was involved
with a cast member.

1059
00:50:18.417 --> 00:50:19.917
maybe it was him.

1060
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.208
And it says she was supposed
to meet him today.

1061
00:50:22.291 --> 00:50:23.458
There's an address.

1062
00:50:23.542 --> 00:50:25.792
Would he still show up?

1063
00:50:25.875 --> 00:50:28.291
There's only one way
to find out.

1064
00:50:30.625 --> 00:50:31.709
George Wilbur.

1065
00:50:31.792 --> 00:50:34.083
B and E. petty theft.
drunk and disorderly.

1066
00:50:34.166 --> 00:50:36.000
- Busy guy.
- Yeah.

1067
00:50:36.083 --> 00:50:37.166
Address?

1068
00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:38.083
Unknown.

1069
00:50:38.166 --> 00:50:39.458
How about an employer?

1070
00:50:39.542 --> 00:50:41.375
Well. he was a dishwasher at
the Ace of Clubs for six months.

1071
00:50:41.417 --> 00:50:43.709
I guess he found a more
lucrative career.

1072
00:50:43.792 --> 00:50:44.667
Yeah.

1073
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:45.542
Any leads on his accomplice?

1074
00:50:45.625 --> 00:50:46.583
Nothing.

1075
00:50:46.667 --> 00:50:47.417
Oh.

1076
00:50:47.458 --> 00:50:48.542
Hey. did you say Ace of Clubs?

1077
00:50:48.625 --> 00:50:49.834
Yeah. you been there?

1078
00:50:49.917 --> 00:50:51.583
Tuesdays are two for one.
pretty good pretzel. too.

1079
00:50:51.667 --> 00:50:52.917
I could go for some pretzels.

1080
00:50:52.959 --> 00:50:53.959
And root-beer.

1081
00:50:54.041 --> 00:50:55.792
I love root-beer.

1082
00:50:59.834 --> 00:51:01.083
George Wilbur?

1083
00:51:01.125 --> 00:51:02.625
Doesn't ring a bell.

1084
00:51:02.709 --> 00:51:04.917
Well. he used to work
in the kitchen.

1085
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.875
Well. I've only been here
a year.

1086
00:51:06.959 --> 00:51:09.166
He quit six months ago.

1087
00:51:09.250 --> 00:51:10.875
Oh.

1088
00:51:13.583 --> 00:51:15.250
I remember now.

1089
00:51:16.458 --> 00:51:18.083
George.

1090
00:51:18.125 --> 00:51:19.667
Quiet guy.

1091
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:22.000
You two interact much?

1092
00:51:22.083 --> 00:51:23.083
No.

1093
00:51:23.125 --> 00:51:24.792
Ever socialize outside of work?

1094
00:51:24.875 --> 00:51:26.083
I don't think so.

1095
00:51:26.125 --> 00:51:28.583
When was the last time
you saw George?

1096
00:51:30.959 --> 00:51:32.667
I couldn't tell ya.

1097
00:51:34.709 --> 00:51:36.709
Couldn't tell us.

1098
00:51:39.291 --> 00:51:40.792
- Pretzel?
- Yeah.

1099
00:51:40.834 --> 00:51:42.333
Yeah. they're good.

1100
00:51:45.667 --> 00:51:47.959
You sure this is it?

1101
00:51:48.041 --> 00:51:49.875
We're at the right address.

1102
00:51:49.959 --> 00:51:52.125
What is this place?

1103
00:51:52.208 --> 00:51:54.667
Only one way to find out.

1104
00:52:03.834 --> 00:52:05.959
So we're just gonna
walk in there?

1105
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.875
Yeah. Why not?

1106
00:52:07.959 --> 00:52:11.375
'Cause we're trespassing
and it might be dangerous.

1107
00:52:11.458 --> 00:52:14.667
Well. it might not be.

1108
00:52:15.166 --> 00:52:18.959
I think it's about time
I negotiate a raise.

1109
00:52:30.208 --> 00:52:32.500
[children playing]

1110
00:52:37.959 --> 00:52:40.417
Hey. kids. I'm Prince Fun-A-Lot.

1111
00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:42.959
Now. who's ready for
a very happy birthday?

1112
00:52:43.041 --> 00:52:46.083
[children cheer]

1113
00:52:54.125 --> 00:52:56.959
So you and Cassandra are...
were uh...

1114
00:52:57.041 --> 00:52:58.583
Birthday party entertainers.

1115
00:52:58.667 --> 00:52:59.500
Yes.

1116
00:52:59.583 --> 00:53:01.375
I was hoping to keep
this private.

1117
00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:02.709
It's a way to make ends meet.

1118
00:53:02.792 --> 00:53:04.959
But Cassandra found out
about it.

1119
00:53:05.041 --> 00:53:06.333
She did.

1120
00:53:06.417 --> 00:53:08.166
I thought she was gonna
tell everyone in the cast

1121
00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:10.500
but she asked for me
to get her work. too.

1122
00:53:10.583 --> 00:53:12.750
Did she say why she needed
extra money?

1123
00:53:12.834 --> 00:53:13.875
We're actors.

1124
00:53:13.959 --> 00:53:16.208
Everyone has a side gig.

1125
00:53:16.291 --> 00:53:19.000
Were you and Cassandra
ever romantically involved?

1126
00:53:19.083 --> 00:53:20.208
No.

1127
00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:23.000
I mean. I tried.

1128
00:53:23.083 --> 00:53:26.709
I got the impression
she was seeing someone.

1129
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.208
Uncle Luis has you
dead to rights.

1130
00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:38.709
You guys are back to
a correspondence game?

1131
00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:40.375
I thought he had enough
of the island life.

1132
00:53:40.417 --> 00:53:46.792
Well. you know. he's uh
visiting my mom for a few weeks.

1133
00:53:46.875 --> 00:53:49.250
Well. if I were you
I'd offer a draw.

1134
00:53:49.333 --> 00:53:52.458
Did you come here
for a chess lesson?

1135
00:53:52.542 --> 00:53:54.417
Oh. I think we both know
why I'm here.

1136
00:53:54.458 --> 00:53:56.750
Yeah. I have my suspicions.

1137
00:53:56.792 --> 00:54:01.875
Does the name Tony Mac
mean anything to you?

1138
00:54:01.959 --> 00:54:02.875
[laughs]

1139
00:54:02.959 --> 00:54:04.750
That's a "yes".

1140
00:54:04.834 --> 00:54:06.125
I didn't say anything.

1141
00:54:06.208 --> 00:54:08.041
You didn't have to.

1142
00:54:08.125 --> 00:54:10.542
I saw Neil at the Ace of Clubs
the other night

1143
00:54:10.625 --> 00:54:13.375
and it looked like he was
in a fight with Tony.

1144
00:54:13.458 --> 00:54:16.959
Tell me. Allie. what were you
doing at a pool hall?

1145
00:54:17.041 --> 00:54:18.917
I was working on my nine ball.

1146
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.750
Really?

1147
00:54:20.792 --> 00:54:22.375
Ok. Detective. answer me this.

1148
00:54:22.458 --> 00:54:25.041
What kind of business does
a mild-mannered playwright

1149
00:54:25.125 --> 00:54:26.458
have with a loan shark?

1150
00:54:26.542 --> 00:54:28.250
I can think of one.

1151
00:54:28.291 --> 00:54:29.958
Funny business.

1152
00:54:29.959 --> 00:54:32.000
What do you think
of this colour?

1153
00:54:32.083 --> 00:54:34.583
I wanna change things up
around here.

1154
00:54:34.667 --> 00:54:36.041
It's called "Citrus Punch".

1155
00:54:36.125 --> 00:54:38.166
Sam.

1156
00:54:38.250 --> 00:54:40.458
I will look into it.

1157
00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:41.542
Ok?

1158
00:54:44.542 --> 00:54:45.917
It's a little bright.

1159
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.291
Yeah.

1160
00:54:47.333 --> 00:54:48.875
The lady at the hardware
store said

1161
00:54:48.959 --> 00:54:50.625
it would really make
a statement.

1162
00:54:50.667 --> 00:54:53.291
Yeah. Yeah. it does do that.

1163
00:54:53.333 --> 00:54:56.834
Look. when I look at you
I don't see Day-Glo.

1164
00:54:56.917 --> 00:55:01.875
Ok. What do you see
when you look at me?

1165
00:55:11.834 --> 00:55:13.166
B-15.

1166
00:55:13.250 --> 00:55:15.250
True Blue.

1167
00:55:21.250 --> 00:55:23.250
I don't hate it.

1168
00:55:27.166 --> 00:55:31.041
Look. I said I'm not interested
in pursuing it.

1169
00:55:31.125 --> 00:55:32.667
I don't understand.

1170
00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:34.875
He returned the goods.
That's all I cared about.

1171
00:55:34.959 --> 00:55:37.875
Yes. but it's very likely
that these are the same two men

1172
00:55:37.959 --> 00:55:39.000
that robbed your bakery.

1173
00:55:39.083 --> 00:55:41.458
Detective. I appreciate
the help.

1174
00:55:41.542 --> 00:55:44.667
but I'd rather just leave this
whole unpleasantness behind me.

1175
00:55:44.709 --> 00:55:46.125
Thank you.

1176
00:55:50.542 --> 00:55:51.667
So he's not pressing charges?

1177
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:52.709
Nope.

1178
00:55:52.792 --> 00:55:54.625
Get this. $500 stolen
from the bakery.

1179
00:55:54.709 --> 00:55:56.000
$2.000 in damages

1180
00:55:56.083 --> 00:55:58.875
and another $2.000 worth of
jewelry stolen from the home.

1181
00:55:58.959 --> 00:56:00.166
But that was recovered.

1182
00:56:00.250 --> 00:56:03.208
Yes. but they broke a TV
and they destroyed artwork.

1183
00:56:03.250 --> 00:56:04.291
So they're careless.

1184
00:56:04.375 --> 00:56:06.917
Or they're sending a message.

1185
00:56:22.917 --> 00:56:25.083
I need you to tell the police
I didn't do it.

1186
00:56:25.166 --> 00:56:26.875
I didn't tell
the police anything.

1187
00:56:26.959 --> 00:56:28.208
You told them something.

1188
00:56:28.291 --> 00:56:29.709
They've talked to me
twice already.

1189
00:56:29.792 --> 00:56:31.250
They have a car parked
outside the pub.

1190
00:56:31.333 --> 00:56:33.709
they don't think I know this
but I do.

1191
00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:34.417
Thank you.

1192
00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:36.250
Hey! I'm gonna lose my job!

1193
00:56:37.250 --> 00:56:39.500
You're hurting me.

1194
00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:44.875
This isn't over.

1195
00:56:47.041 --> 00:56:48.250
Hi.

1196
00:56:48.333 --> 00:56:49.542
Ok. let me get this straight.

1197
00:56:49.625 --> 00:56:51.250
Roger Giles threatened you?

1198
00:56:51.333 --> 00:56:53.333
Well. I don't know if it was
a threat.

1199
00:56:53.417 --> 00:56:55.583
He was just really angry.

1200
00:56:55.625 --> 00:56:57.500
Um. maybe I'm just making
a bigger deal out of it...

1201
00:56:57.583 --> 00:56:58.458
No. no. no.

1202
00:56:58.542 --> 00:56:59.959
I'm-I'm glad that
you're telling me.

1203
00:57:00.041 --> 00:57:02.041
You know. you should probably
consider staying with someone.

1204
00:57:02.125 --> 00:57:04.166
Just until things cool down.

1205
00:57:04.250 --> 00:57:06.917
Oh. yeah. I already talked
to Maya.

1206
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.417
Yeah. Yeah. yeah. yeah.
That's-that's good. Maya.

1207
00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:11.750
That's good.

1208
00:57:11.834 --> 00:57:13.959
Oh man. I am-I am so sorry.

1209
00:57:14.041 --> 00:57:16.250
No. don't worry. it's... hey.

1210
00:57:16.333 --> 00:57:18.417
You took my suggestion.

1211
00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:20.166
Yeah. uh...

1212
00:57:22.375 --> 00:57:23.667
True Blue.

1213
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:25.834
Good. It suits you.

1214
00:57:27.041 --> 00:57:29.125
I'm gonna repaint the living
room this weekend.

1215
00:57:29.166 --> 00:57:30.375
Oh.

1216
00:57:30.458 --> 00:57:32.583
So you won't be doing another
stakeout at my front door.

1217
00:57:32.667 --> 00:57:35.208
Detective Acosta.

1218
00:57:35.291 --> 00:57:37.917
Well. Miss Adams.
I was told that someone

1219
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:41.208
was more than capable of
taking care of herself.

1220
00:57:41.291 --> 00:57:44.125
Wow. So you do listen.

1221
00:57:44.166 --> 00:57:45.125
Oh yeah.

1222
00:57:45.208 --> 00:57:48.125
That's good. because
I'm out of pancake mix.

1223
00:57:59.834 --> 00:58:01.667
Detective Acosta.

1224
00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:02.917
Tony Mac.

1225
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.959
Welcome to our
little establishment.

1226
00:58:05.041 --> 00:58:06.458
What can I get for you?

1227
00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:09.208
You look like whiskey man. neat.

1228
00:58:09.291 --> 00:58:11.458
No. thank you. I'm fine.

1229
00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:13.375
I'm actually looking for
one of your employees.

1230
00:58:13.458 --> 00:58:14.500
Roger Giles.

1231
00:58:14.542 --> 00:58:17.166
I'm afraid Mr. Giles
no longer works here.

1232
00:58:17.250 --> 00:58:18.166
When did he quit?

1233
00:58:18.250 --> 00:58:20.375
He didn't quit.
I had to let him go.

1234
00:58:20.458 --> 00:58:22.917
Sad to see it happen.
very loyal.

1235
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:27.417
but uh. I couldn't ignore
the noise around him.

1236
00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:28.959
You understand.

1237
00:58:30.625 --> 00:58:32.250
Huh.

1238
00:58:32.333 --> 00:58:33.750
I appreciate your time.

1239
00:58:33.834 --> 00:58:35.375
Any time.

1240
00:58:41.458 --> 00:58:43.709
You a billiard man. Detective?

1241
00:58:43.792 --> 00:58:47.333
Yeah. I play a little.
This a sign-up sheet?

1242
00:58:47.375 --> 00:58:50.291
It is. Tables go fast
around here.

1243
00:59:21.333 --> 00:59:22.500
Hey.

1244
00:59:22.583 --> 00:59:23.417
Oh. hi.

1245
00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:24.500
So since you helped me out
at the bar

1246
00:59:24.583 --> 00:59:26.208
I thought I would return the favor.

1247
00:59:26.250 --> 00:59:27.375
Ok. I'm listening.

1248
00:59:27.417 --> 00:59:29.375
I just spoke to the critic
at The Times.

1249
00:59:29.458 --> 00:59:31.709
it turns out he received
a dozen emails

1250
00:59:31.792 --> 00:59:33.375
begging him to attend the show.

1251
00:59:33.458 --> 00:59:36.834
So I got him to forward them
to me.

1252
00:59:36.917 --> 00:59:38.500
Laura Duphrain.

1253
00:59:38.583 --> 00:59:40.542
Now why would an understudy
insist a critic

1254
00:59:40.583 --> 00:59:43.375
come see her performance?

1255
00:59:43.458 --> 00:59:47.125
Unless she knew she would
go on that night.

1256
00:59:52.041 --> 00:59:54.500
What can I get for you...
today?

1257
00:59:54.583 --> 00:59:55.542
The truth.

1258
00:59:55.625 --> 00:59:57.750
Oh. and a cinnamon bun.
Please.

1259
01:00:04.291 --> 01:00:07.125
I didn't invite that newspaper
critic there to see me.

1260
01:00:07.208 --> 01:00:08.792
I wanted him to see her.

1261
01:00:08.875 --> 01:00:10.208
Cassandra. why?

1262
01:00:10.291 --> 01:00:11.750
Because she was terrible.

1263
01:00:11.792 --> 01:00:13.166
I thought if she got
a poor review

1264
01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:15.208
Neil would have to re-cast
the role.

1265
01:00:15.291 --> 01:00:19.458
If she was so terrible then
how did she get the lead?

1266
01:00:19.542 --> 01:00:21.250
Isn't it obvious?

1267
01:00:23.375 --> 01:00:25.000
Neil was in love with her.

1268
01:00:25.083 --> 01:00:27.583
Cassandra was sneaking around
with Neil?

1269
01:00:27.667 --> 01:00:29.500
He's married.

1270
01:00:29.583 --> 01:00:31.959
Hence the sneaking.

1271
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.709
An affair. That's a pretty
serious charge.

1272
01:00:35.792 --> 01:00:37.709
You just accused me of murder.

1273
01:00:37.792 --> 01:00:39.625
That was more of
a trial balloon.

1274
01:00:39.709 --> 01:00:42.458
Look. everyone knows I should
have been cast in the lead.

1275
01:00:42.542 --> 01:00:44.625
There's no other explanation.

1276
01:00:44.667 --> 01:00:46.583
Enjoy your bun.

1277
01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:14.417
[knocking]

1278
01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:16.500
You know. I'm so sorry
to stop by like this

1279
01:01:16.542 --> 01:01:17.917
but they're my favorite pair.

1280
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.458
Oh. I haven't seen any earrings.
are you sure you lost them here?

1281
01:01:21.542 --> 01:01:24.000
Uh. this is the last place
I remember wearing them.

1282
01:01:24.041 --> 01:01:25.750
Well. feel free to have
a look around.

1283
01:01:25.834 --> 01:01:27.125
Thank you.

1284
01:01:28.875 --> 01:01:32.000
Oh. Neil proposed to you
on stage?

1285
01:01:32.041 --> 01:01:37.041
Yes. Neil has always had
a flair for the dramatic.

1286
01:01:37.125 --> 01:01:40.083
Well. I guess it worked.

1287
01:01:40.166 --> 01:01:42.917
Well. it hasn't always
been easy.

1288
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.583
My friends thought he could be
a bit um. mercurial.

1289
01:01:46.667 --> 01:01:48.667
I think that's the word.

1290
01:01:48.709 --> 01:01:50.333
And then there was
the dry spell.

1291
01:01:50.375 --> 01:01:54.333
He couldn't get anyone to return
his calls for years.

1292
01:01:54.375 --> 01:01:56.625
But you stood by him.

1293
01:01:56.709 --> 01:01:58.375
Yes. of course.

1294
01:01:58.417 --> 01:02:03.000
I worked two jobs to keep us
afloat while he wrote.

1295
01:02:03.083 --> 01:02:08.625
It was hard. but
it was worth it.

1296
01:02:08.709 --> 01:02:10.959
You know. I'm not finding
anything here.

1297
01:02:11.041 --> 01:02:12.417
do you mind if I check
the restroom?

1298
01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:13.542
Not at all. Please.

1299
01:02:13.625 --> 01:02:14.917
Thanks.

1300
01:02:50.250 --> 01:02:51.250
[clears throat]

1301
01:02:51.333 --> 01:02:52.625
Need a hand?

1302
01:02:52.709 --> 01:02:54.583
- Hi.
- Hi.

1303
01:02:54.667 --> 01:02:55.792
What're you doing here?

1304
01:02:55.875 --> 01:02:58.125
I had a few follow-up questions
for Ms. Kahn.

1305
01:02:58.208 --> 01:03:00.208
but she seems very distracted.

1306
01:03:00.291 --> 01:03:03.458
Says she's helping a friend
locate a lost item.

1307
01:03:03.542 --> 01:03:05.333
An earring. is it?

1308
01:03:05.417 --> 01:03:09.500
You know me. if my head
wasn't attached...

1309
01:03:09.583 --> 01:03:10.625
Right.

1310
01:03:10.709 --> 01:03:14.583
The thing is. I do know you.

1311
01:03:14.625 --> 01:03:16.125
What's your angle?

1312
01:03:16.208 --> 01:03:17.250
No angle.

1313
01:03:17.333 --> 01:03:20.667
I'm just looking for an item
that I misplaced.

1314
01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:22.750
In his desk?

1315
01:03:22.834 --> 01:03:23.834
Mmmhmm.

1316
01:03:23.959 --> 01:03:25.583
Uh-huh.

1317
01:03:28.542 --> 01:03:31.458
Fine. You caught me.

1318
01:03:31.542 --> 01:03:33.750
I heard a rumour among the cast
that Neil and Cassandra

1319
01:03:33.834 --> 01:03:37.291
were involved so I figured
I would come check it out.

1320
01:03:37.375 --> 01:03:39.959
You know. see if there was a
photograph or a love letter.

1321
01:03:40.041 --> 01:03:42.041
or something he kept
tucked away.

1322
01:03:42.125 --> 01:03:43.291
Hmm.

1323
01:03:43.333 --> 01:03:47.041
But you're here now so I will
defer to you. Detective.

1324
01:03:47.125 --> 01:03:48.458
Well. thank you.

1325
01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:49.959
Allie?

1326
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.458
What?

1327
01:03:51.542 --> 01:03:54.291
Aren't you forgetting something?

1328
01:03:54.375 --> 01:03:58.250
I'm guessing front pocket.

1329
01:03:58.333 --> 01:04:00.959
No.

1330
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.917
It's actually the back pocket.

1331
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Hmm.

1332
01:04:09.125 --> 01:04:10.291
I found it.

1333
01:04:10.375 --> 01:04:13.417
Oh. I am so glad.

1334
01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:15.750
So am I.

1335
01:04:18.208 --> 01:04:19.667
Cassandra and Neil?

1336
01:04:19.709 --> 01:04:21.000
[laughs]

1337
01:04:21.083 --> 01:04:21.875
No way.

1338
01:04:21.959 --> 01:04:22.917
No.

1339
01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.041
I heard the rumours
and so did Cassandra.

1340
01:04:25.125 --> 01:04:26.208
We laughed at them.

1341
01:04:26.291 --> 01:04:27.959
You sure she didn't keep
anything from you?

1342
01:04:28.041 --> 01:04:30.000
I mean. he was married.

1343
01:04:30.041 --> 01:04:32.750
No. Let me show you the texts.

1344
01:04:33.458 --> 01:04:35.917
Oh. You and Cassandra
were pretty close.

1345
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.667
Yeah. she was my best friend.
We shared everything.

1346
01:04:38.709 --> 01:04:40.000
Clothes. shoes...

1347
01:04:40.041 --> 01:04:41.542
Passwords?

1348
01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:49.166
Try "Pepper". her family dog.

1349
01:04:49.208 --> 01:04:51.000
Nope.

1350
01:04:51.041 --> 01:04:55.875
Maybe her birthday?
11. 13. 90.

1351
01:04:55.917 --> 01:04:57.458
Nope.

1352
01:04:57.542 --> 01:04:59.041
Oh! She let me the login

1353
01:04:59.125 --> 01:05:00.792
to her online streaming
account once

1354
01:05:00.875 --> 01:05:06.291
and the password was "password".

1355
01:05:06.375 --> 01:05:08.417
Oh. Bingo.

1356
01:05:09.875 --> 01:05:13.208
West and Broad Street.
Isn't that the museum?

1357
01:05:13.291 --> 01:05:16.417
No. that's The Gazette.

1358
01:05:22.125 --> 01:05:24.458
Sam. we got Roger Giles.

1359
01:05:24.542 --> 01:05:25.583
Alright.

1360
01:05:29.375 --> 01:05:30.792
I just wanted to scare her.

1361
01:05:30.875 --> 01:05:33.417
Scare her? Why?

1362
01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:35.709
She told everyone I was a creep.

1363
01:05:35.792 --> 01:05:38.041
She tried to have me kicked out
of the play.

1364
01:05:38.083 --> 01:05:40.500
After that no one
would even talk to me.

1365
01:05:40.583 --> 01:05:43.417
So after the murder you went
back for the note?

1366
01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:44.500
Yeah.

1367
01:05:44.583 --> 01:05:46.875
And that's when I found you
in the hallway.

1368
01:05:46.959 --> 01:05:48.959
I knew it would look bad.

1369
01:05:49.041 --> 01:05:51.875
I- I just didn't want anyone
to find it

1370
01:05:51.959 --> 01:05:56.125
and think that I had something
to do with her death.

1371
01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:03.750
Ok.

1372
01:06:05.458 --> 01:06:07.083
The south side of the lot?

1373
01:06:07.125 --> 01:06:10.917
Yeah. can't narrow it down
more than that.

1374
01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.166
I'm not seeing anything.

1375
01:06:13.250 --> 01:06:15.542
Oh. oh. wait!
I found it!

1376
01:06:15.625 --> 01:06:17.250
I found it!

1377
01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:21.458
Um. call it.

1378
01:06:25.125 --> 01:06:28.166
[phone ringing]

1379
01:06:31.667 --> 01:06:32.834
[gasps]

1380
01:06:38.875 --> 01:06:40.083
Detective Acosta?

1381
01:06:40.166 --> 01:06:41.709
You call in the trespassing?

1382
01:06:41.792 --> 01:06:45.000
I caught this one skulking
around the parking lot.

1383
01:06:46.542 --> 01:06:48.959
Good evening. Detective.

1384
01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.500
Good evening. Miss Adams.

1385
01:06:58.166 --> 01:07:00.458
What're you doing here. Miss Adams?

1386
01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:02.375
Really. it's just one
big misunderstanding.

1387
01:07:02.458 --> 01:07:03.542
Oh.

1388
01:07:03.625 --> 01:07:05.125
I can't wait to hear it.

1389
01:07:05.166 --> 01:07:09.166
Great. Well. um... you see.
the thing is. uh...

1390
01:07:09.208 --> 01:07:10.792
She was meeting me.

1391
01:07:10.875 --> 01:07:12.750
She never said anything
about that.

1392
01:07:12.834 --> 01:07:15.750
Uh. yeah. that's 'cause
we're working on a story.

1393
01:07:15.834 --> 01:07:17.166
Deep cover.

1394
01:07:17.208 --> 01:07:18.250
Uh. you know.

1395
01:07:18.333 --> 01:07:19.834
So I asked her not
to say anything.

1396
01:07:19.875 --> 01:07:22.834
You know we've been dealing
with theft in the building.

1397
01:07:22.917 --> 01:07:24.250
Does she really look
like someone

1398
01:07:24.333 --> 01:07:27.417
who would steal paper
and ink cartridges?

1399
01:07:28.333 --> 01:07:31.500
Honestly. Detective. she has
permission to be here.

1400
01:07:33.250 --> 01:07:34.834
I guess that settles it.

1401
01:07:34.875 --> 01:07:38.250
Ok. well uh. Allie. let's go.

1402
01:07:38.333 --> 01:07:39.583
Where?

1403
01:07:39.667 --> 01:07:41.834
Oh. yes. The story.

1404
01:07:41.917 --> 01:07:43.375
Goodbye.

1405
01:07:47.375 --> 01:07:48.333
Thank you for that.

1406
01:07:48.417 --> 01:07:49.458
No problem.

1407
01:07:49.542 --> 01:07:50.542
I bet you're wondering

1408
01:07:50.625 --> 01:07:52.041
why I'm in the parking lot
of The Gazette.

1409
01:07:52.125 --> 01:07:54.583
Oh. I can't wait to hear this.

1410
01:08:05.083 --> 01:08:07.000
[knocking]

1411
01:08:09.917 --> 01:08:11.333
Hello.

1412
01:08:11.417 --> 01:08:13.083
That was a quick interview.

1413
01:08:13.166 --> 01:08:14.083
I talk fast.

1414
01:08:14.166 --> 01:08:14.959
Hmm.

1415
01:08:15.041 --> 01:08:16.875
Question completely unrelated.

1416
01:08:16.959 --> 01:08:18.083
Of course.

1417
01:08:18.166 --> 01:08:20.250
What would one need in order
to get a search warrant

1418
01:08:20.333 --> 01:08:21.333
for someone's vehicle?

1419
01:08:21.417 --> 01:08:22.583
Probable cause.

1420
01:08:22.667 --> 01:08:24.500
Oh. Like this?

1421
01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:26.625
A picture of a phone.

1422
01:08:26.709 --> 01:08:29.333
No. not just any phone.

1423
01:08:29.417 --> 01:08:31.458
Cassandra's phone.

1424
01:08:36.625 --> 01:08:39.166
I didn't take her phone.
I swear.

1425
01:08:39.250 --> 01:08:40.583
She must have left it behind.

1426
01:08:40.625 --> 01:08:43.041
Ok. but you told us you hadn't
spoken to Cassandra

1427
01:08:43.125 --> 01:08:44.083
for about a week.

1428
01:08:44.166 --> 01:08:47.333
How did her phone end up
in your car?

1429
01:08:49.750 --> 01:08:50.500
You know what?

1430
01:08:50.583 --> 01:08:51.875
Let's just try this again.

1431
01:08:51.959 --> 01:08:55.166
When was the last time
that you saw Cassandra Griffin?

1432
01:08:57.959 --> 01:08:59.500
The night before she died.

1433
01:08:59.583 --> 01:09:02.125
Under what circumstances?

1434
01:09:02.208 --> 01:09:04.792
I- I stopped by the theatre
after her rehearsal.

1435
01:09:04.875 --> 01:09:07.333
I just wanted to talk.

1436
01:09:07.417 --> 01:09:09.542
I- I convinced her
to take a ride.

1437
01:09:09.625 --> 01:09:11.083
And then what happened?

1438
01:09:11.166 --> 01:09:12.583
I asked her for another chance.

1439
01:09:12.667 --> 01:09:14.583
She said she wasn't interested.

1440
01:09:14.667 --> 01:09:17.166
And then I dropped her back off.
I swear.

1441
01:09:17.250 --> 01:09:18.250
You lied.

1442
01:09:18.291 --> 01:09:19.959
Only because I knew how
it would look.

1443
01:09:20.041 --> 01:09:21.125
And how would it look?

1444
01:09:21.166 --> 01:09:22.792
Like I did something
to Cassandra.

1445
01:09:22.834 --> 01:09:25.417
but I would never hurt her!
I swear!

1446
01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:27.250
Ok. Ok.

1447
01:09:27.333 --> 01:09:28.291
Alright.

1448
01:09:28.375 --> 01:09:30.417
Then I guess you have nothing
to worry about.

1449
01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:34.083
And our officers who are currently
searching your apartment.

1450
01:09:34.166 --> 01:09:37.917
they'll be able to back up
all these claims?

1451
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.041

1452
01:09:39.125 --> 01:09:40.166
- Mmmhmm.
- Mmmhmm.

1453

on the Griffin girl?

1454
01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:48.291
No. he swears he
wasn't involved.

1455
01:09:48.375 --> 01:09:49.625

1456
01:09:49.709 --> 01:09:51.417
You could say that.

1457
01:09:52.166 --> 01:09:55.417
Interesting. But not
incriminating.

1458
01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:57.417
How about this?

1459
01:09:59.291 --> 01:10:00.625
Trick or treat.

1460
01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:03.250
Huh. Now that's more convincing.

1461
01:10:08.834 --> 01:10:10.250

1462
01:10:10.333 --> 01:10:12.333
Is this a good time?

1463
01:10:12.375 --> 01:10:14.959
I think you and I should have
a chat.

1464
01:10:19.709 --> 01:10:22.000
Carl Winter's bakery got
into some financial trouble

1465
01:10:22.041 --> 01:10:24.333
so they reached out to a loan
shark for help.

1466
01:10:24.417 --> 01:10:25.750
Tony Mac.

1467
01:10:25.834 --> 01:10:27.458
Mike was moonlighting for Mac.

1468
01:10:27.542 --> 01:10:29.667
When Winter came up short
in his monthly payment...

1469
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:31.500
He sent Mike to collect.

1470
01:10:31.542 --> 01:10:34.166
Could Cassandra have found out?

1471
01:10:34.208 --> 01:10:36.500
If she did. he might have gone
to great lengths

1472
01:10:36.542 --> 01:10:38.625
to make sure she never told.

1473
01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:41.083
Hmm.

1474
01:10:43.875 --> 01:10:46.500
Mike. the ex with Cassandra's
missing phone.

1475
01:10:46.542 --> 01:10:48.000
He's at the top of my list.

1476
01:10:48.083 --> 01:10:49.875
See. mine is still Roger.

1477
01:10:49.917 --> 01:10:51.542
Cassandra was killed
with his belt

1478
01:10:51.625 --> 01:10:54.083
and he thinks you can ID him.

1479
01:10:54.166 --> 01:10:55.709
Well. let's not forget Laura.

1480
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:57.875
She had reason to want Cassandra
out of the way.

1481

1482

got strangled

1483

by the man she was having
an affair with.

1484
01:11:05.625 --> 01:11:07.917
Maya! Why didn't you
say anything?

1485
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.208
Well. I didn't know.

1486
01:11:09.291 --> 01:11:11.208
How could you not know?

1487
01:11:11.291 --> 01:11:15.000
Uh. I only read the scenes
I'm in.

1488
01:11:27.041 --> 01:11:28.500
Alright. guys.
Thanks for coming in.

1489

I really appreciate it.

1490

Who was that?

1491
01:11:35.542 --> 01:11:37.083
They heard about the murder
on the news.

1492

They think they saw

1493
01:11:38.291 --> 01:11:39.917
the person who slashed her
tires that night.

1494
01:11:39.959 --> 01:11:41.375
Came in to give a description.

1495
01:11:41.458 --> 01:11:42.667
Huh.

1496

What do you think?

1497
01:11:45.959 --> 01:11:47.792
I didn't slash
Cassandra's tires.

1498
01:11:47.875 --> 01:11:49.291
Well. as her understudy.

1499
01:11:49.375 --> 01:11:50.417
if she doesn't turn up

1500

of the show. right?

1501
01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:53.834

like you.

1503
01:11:55.792 --> 01:11:58.875
Blonde hair. about 5'6".

1504
01:11:58.959 --> 01:12:00.166
It could have been anyone.

1505
01:12:00.250 --> 01:12:01.333

I'm sorry. Miss Duphrain.

1507
01:12:03.083 --> 01:12:05.667

better performances.

Well. everyone's a critic.

1509
01:12:18.458 --> 01:12:19.333
Hey.

1510
01:12:19.417 --> 01:12:22.625
We're working up a line up
for Tremont.

1511
01:12:22.667 --> 01:12:23.959
I don't know if he's our guy.

1512
01:12:24.041 --> 01:12:25.250
I mean. how would Mike Tremont

1513
01:12:25.333 --> 01:12:27.166
get in and out of the theatre
without being seen?

1514
01:12:27.250 --> 01:12:30.625
There's an exit in the costume
room to the street.

1515
01:12:30.667 --> 01:12:32.208

1516

Kenny Kwan.

1517
01:12:33.583 --> 01:12:36.041
Yes. Kenny Kwan said that
the wind kept blowing it open

1518
01:12:36.125 --> 01:12:37.709
so they chained it shut.

1519
01:12:37.792 --> 01:12:39.375
Only one way in. one way out.

1520
01:12:39.458 --> 01:12:41.000
That's a fire code violation.

1521
01:12:41.083 --> 01:12:42.125
Let's solve the murder first

1522
01:12:42.208 --> 01:12:43.917
and worry about writing them
a ticket later.

1523
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.291

1524
01:12:47.208 --> 01:12:49.750

we're missing something.

the set pieces yesterday.

choose Cassandra.

was an unconventional choice.

1567

stronger actresses.

01:17:53.375 --> 01:17:55.250
Of course not.

1618
01:17:58.125 --> 01:17:59.917
I have to find Neil.

1619
01:18:13.542 --> 01:18:15.291
Neil: Allie?

1620

Are you in here?

1621
01:18:21.208 --> 01:18:24.583
I just want to talk with you.

1622
01:18:27.291 --> 01:18:29.834
It's not what you think.

1623
01:18:31.083 --> 01:18:33.250
Neil: You don't understand.

1624
01:18:33.333 --> 01:18:36.834
Unless you really truly
have loved someone

1625
01:18:36.917 --> 01:18:38.875
you don't know what it's like.

1626
01:18:40.542 --> 01:18:43.250
You see them in trouble

1627
01:18:43.333 --> 01:18:46.458
and they're afraid

1628
01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:51.583
and all you wanna do is help.

Ok. Allie.

I've had enough of the cat

Sara. what're you doing?

1645
01:20:22.375 --> 01:20:24.709
I told you I had all
of this under control.

1646
01:20:24.792 --> 01:20:26.625
You told me all kinds of
things. Neil.

1647
01:20:26.709 --> 01:20:28.917
And. as usual. I had to take
care of it myself.

1648
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.917
Just like you took care
of Cassandra?

1649
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.250
Wait. she did it?

1650
01:20:32.291 --> 01:20:33.917
There were rumours
about Cassandra and Neil

1651
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.083
having an affair.

1652
01:20:35.125 --> 01:20:36.917
They were more than
just rumours.

Allie!

1655
01:20:40.291 --> 01:20:42.875
The night of the show
you confronted her.

1656
01:20:42.959 --> 01:20:43.959
She denied it.

1657
01:20:44.041 --> 01:20:45.583
She denied everything.

1658
01:20:45.667 --> 01:20:48.417
But I know she was lying.

1659
01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:51.709
So when you found yourself alone
in the costume room with her

1660
01:20:51.792 --> 01:20:54.500
you grabbed a belt
and you strangled her.

1661
01:20:54.583 --> 01:20:55.458
Stay back.

1662
01:20:55.542 --> 01:20:56.834
Allie. stay back!

1663

When you realized
that I had been there

1664
01:20:59.208 --> 01:21:00.458
you came clean to Neil.

1665
01:21:00.542 --> 01:21:04.583
hoping he could help you with
the only possible witness.

1666
01:21:04.625 --> 01:21:05.959
Me.

1667
01:21:14.125 --> 01:21:15.959
I saw the way you looked at her.

1668
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.625
How could I compete with that?

1669

I wasn't gonna lose you.

I was never gonna lose you
to her.

from Neil's house.

Anyway. it took about 20 minutes
and she confessed to everything.

There you are.

1682
01:21:58.709 --> 01:22:01.291
Police dogs found this
behind their house.

I had a word limit.

But the important thing is. is
that you saved the day. again.
