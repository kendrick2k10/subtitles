3
00:00:45.376 --> 00:00:49.210
In the middle of the 19th century
the Brest Fortress was built

4
00:00:49.376 --> 00:00:52.126
at the confluence
of the Bug and Mukhavets rivers.

5
00:00:52.293 --> 00:00:55.876
It was a system of forts and bastions
to make the citadel impregnable.

6
00:00:56.043 --> 00:00:59.293
The defences became obsolete.
but the defenders remained stoical.

7
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.335
20 years after the war. the truth
was revealed in a book by Sergei Smirnov.

8
00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:06.418
On May 8. 1965 it was awarded
the title of Hero Fortress.

9
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.918
IN HONOUR OF THE HEROES
OF THE BREST FORTRESS

10
00:01:10.085 --> 00:01:12.668
AND ALL THOSE WHO HAVE
DEFENDED THE MOTHERLAND.

11
00:01:52.168 --> 00:01:55.293
JUNE 21. 1941. BREST. CITY PARK

12
00:02:07.835 --> 00:02:12.043
<i>I remember. I remember everything.</i>

13
00:02:13.668 --> 00:02:19.085
<i>There was dancing on Saturday
in the city park. just as there always was.</i>

14
00:02:27.335 --> 00:02:31.335
<i>This was me - Alexander Akimov.</i>

15
00:02:32.376 --> 00:02:36.710
<i>a pupil of the 333rd
regiment's military band.</i>

16
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.960
<i>My parents died in Spain in '37.</i>

17
00:02:43.126 --> 00:02:47.043
<i>There was just me
and my brother left.</i>

18
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.501
<i>And this was Anya. simply Anya.</i>

19
00:02:52.543 --> 00:02:58.876
<i>Although. to me.
she could never be "just" Anya.</i>

20
00:03:01.585 --> 00:03:05.460
Wait a moment. I'll be right back.

21
00:03:21.835 --> 00:03:24.960
Sashka. why aren't you
in the barracks?

22
00:03:27.126 --> 00:03:32.251
Oska asked me. The entire band was sent
away. The last trumpeter left on Wednesday.

23
00:03:32.418 --> 00:03:36.960
- Private Akimov of the military band.
- Sir.

24
00:03:37.126 --> 00:03:38.960
Return to the fortress immediately.

25
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:43.460
Why are you shouting at me?
You are not my captain. not my father.

26
00:03:43.626 --> 00:03:45.460
Why are you shouting at me?

27
00:03:45.626 --> 00:03:49.418
Tell Sergeant Kovalenok to punish you
as he sees fit. I will check.

28
00:03:49.585 --> 00:03:51.126
And try not to play like that.

29
00:03:51.293 --> 00:03:55.751
About. march.

30
00:04:02.043 --> 00:04:04.751
And he calls himself my brother.

31
00:04:06.168 --> 00:04:08.335
Family of the military
officer â€” get ready!

32
00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:11.376
Anya. come here.
What sort of a circus is this?

33
00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:14.710
- Stay still.
- Quiet. Stand still.

34
00:04:14.876 --> 00:04:17.543
- Still.
- It's easier being in charge of a regiment.

35
00:04:50.001 --> 00:04:54.835
<i>This was my home. My fortress.</i>

36
00:04:55.001 --> 00:04:57.085
<i>It was rather big.</i>

37
00:04:58.126 --> 00:05:04.126
<i>It was impossible to clamber all over it.
but there were places I knew</i>

38
00:05:04.293 --> 00:05:09.668
<i>where. if I wanted to hide.
nobody would be able to find me.</i>

39
00:05:46.418 --> 00:05:47.876
Thank you.

40
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.043
BREST. THE RAILWAY STATION

41
00:06:14.876 --> 00:06:17.626
<i>Passengers. please keep order
and stay calm.</i>

42
00:06:17.793 --> 00:06:19.585
Don't congregate
next to the ticket booths.

43
00:06:19.751 --> 00:06:21.376
Please leave!

44
00:06:21.543 --> 00:06:24.085
There are no tickets available
for the next trains.

45
00:06:25.543 --> 00:06:32.668
<i>There are no tickets available
for today! No tickets available!</i>

46
00:06:34.168 --> 00:06:38.001
I said that there are no tickets.
not even for army reservations.

47
00:06:38.168 --> 00:06:41.418
- There aren't any for anybody.
- I am telling you in plain Russian.

48
00:06:41.585 --> 00:06:43.293
I have 3 days to get there
and back.

49
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.793
Let them give you tickets.

50
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.210
We haven't got any.
Not even on pain of death.

51
00:06:49.376 --> 00:06:54.376
I have family in Daugvapils. I have
to bring them to where I am serving.

52
00:06:54.543 --> 00:06:57.251
July 20th.
That's the earliest that I have.

53
00:06:57.418 --> 00:06:59.210
Cancel the reservation.

54
00:07:01.585 --> 00:07:07.460
I am telling you as a friend - I am
forbidden to touch the reservation.

55
00:07:07.626 --> 00:07:11.626
I received an army directive. I can
only act according to specific orders.

56
00:07:11.793 --> 00:07:14.751
- You can't do anything.
- Perhaps it's for the best.

57
00:07:14.918 --> 00:07:17.043
Everyone is leaving this place!

58
00:07:19.335 --> 00:07:22.460
What exactly do you mean by that?

59
00:07:25.043 --> 00:07:30.126
It's so hot. like the Sahara.
What a day!

60
00:07:30.293 --> 00:07:32.293
I feel like lying down and dying.

61
00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.751
The German special train.

62
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.918
Hello. Comrade Commissar.

63
00:08:11.418 --> 00:08:16.793
- Hi there. Nikolai. Are you bringing a movie?
- Yeah.

64
00:08:35.918 --> 00:08:38.376
Hup. Hup! Faster!

65
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:53.710
Tugushev.

66
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:03.085
Kolya is fast.
But Tugushev is even faster.

67
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:10.918
There will not be a war.

68
00:09:16.168 --> 00:09:19.251
- Checkmate.
- A tragic mistake.

69
00:09:19.418 --> 00:09:22.668
- One more. come on.
- Commissar.

70
00:09:24.626 --> 00:09:26.918
You didn't leave.
Comrade Regiment Commissar?

71
00:09:27.085 --> 00:09:28.335
As if I could leave you.

72
00:09:28.501 --> 00:09:31.418
What sort of a final game
would that be?

73
00:09:33.793 --> 00:09:36.918
Attention.
Look to the right.

74
00:09:40.793 --> 00:09:45.293
- Did you bring the film?
- Yes.

75
00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:49.085
- And beer.
- Maybe without beer would be better.

76
00:09:49.251 --> 00:09:55.043
- Shur. tomorrow is Sunday.
- On Sunday people want to relax.

77
00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:58.793
So I will relax then.
Three beers.

78
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:04.751
- Alik. Nina.
- You didn't say that. You didn't.

79
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:10.418
- And sodas for the kids.
- At least you remembered about them.

80
00:10:13.793 --> 00:10:16.210
Have we forgotten anything?

81
00:10:16.376 --> 00:10:19.543
- Thanks. Sonya.
- Let's go. soldiers.

82
00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:50.876
- Did you bring it?
- Yes. I did.

83
00:10:52.835 --> 00:10:58.168
- Probably about love again?
- Yes. it's about love.

84
00:11:11.251 --> 00:11:13.126
It seems I have been caught out.
Comrade Sergeant.

85
00:11:13.293 --> 00:11:14.668
What?

86
00:11:14.835 --> 00:11:18.835
Do you want a belting or what?
Where on earth did he find you?

87
00:11:19.001 --> 00:11:21.585
I played a wrong note.
and you know my brother.

88
00:11:21.751 --> 00:11:22.960
What did you play?

89
00:11:23.126 --> 00:11:25.418
"The Hills of Manchuria."

90
00:11:25.585 --> 00:11:29.793
Make sure you learn it.
You'll play it on parade.

91
00:11:37.585 --> 00:11:39.876
Stop the music.

92
00:11:41.335 --> 00:11:46.751
- Khrusch. what are you doing?
- Lieutenant. it's like "Swan Lake"...

93
00:11:58.835 --> 00:12:01.585
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

94
00:12:12.918 --> 00:12:18.918
So. when will the war with Germany
start. in your opinion?

95
00:12:20.418 --> 00:12:21.793
It's like that. is it?

96
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.543
I have to carry out
an investigation into your case

97
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:29.335
concerning the scaremongering
rumours about a war with our ally.

98
00:12:30.626 --> 00:12:34.835
I believe that you are a committed
Communist. An honest man.

99
00:12:35.001 --> 00:12:39.960
Why are you being called
a scaremonger. Pyotr Mikhailovich?

100
00:12:41.085 --> 00:12:44.626
You should ask whoever it was
who appointed me.

101
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:55.918
Help me. Pyotr Mikhailovich. I don't
have a high rank. or much authority.

102
00:12:56.085 --> 00:13:00.293
You can see how much I have to do.
I can see that it's not your fault.

103
00:13:02.168 --> 00:13:04.876
Who is spreading panic?
What do you think?

104
00:13:07.043 --> 00:13:11.293
I asked you here
so we could be on friendly terms.

105
00:13:12.335 --> 00:13:14.668
- Who is it. Comrade Major?
- It was me.

106
00:13:16.668 --> 00:13:22.668
I let it slip a few times that
the Germans would soon be upon us.

107
00:13:24.418 --> 00:13:28.835
I haven't heard anything like this
from anyone else.

108
00:13:29.876 --> 00:13:34.043
There is no panic in the garrison.
Comrade Vainstein.

109
00:13:35.376 --> 00:13:37.460
You don't have to worry about that.

110
00:13:44.501 --> 00:13:46.418
Just look. Lieutenant.

111
00:13:48.126 --> 00:13:52.751
If they do come.
we will be caught in a bottleneck.

112
00:13:52.918 --> 00:13:56.210
The garrison is 8.000 strong.

113
00:13:56.376 --> 00:14:00.418
A crowd of this size will not make it
out of the Northern Gate alone.

114
00:14:00.585 --> 00:14:04.960
all with their mothers and children.
with their curtains. tablecloths. napkins.

115
00:14:05.126 --> 00:14:07.918
It's no better than a lousy sanatorium.

116
00:14:08.085 --> 00:14:13.876
Most of the garrison should be moved
to the vicinity of the troops.

117
00:14:14.043 --> 00:14:19.751
That is what I have said for the past
two wars. and I am saying it again.

118
00:14:19.918 --> 00:14:21.793
And the entire 4th Army?

119
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.460
Pyotr Mikhailovich.
they won't leave us in it?

120
00:14:25.626 --> 00:14:27.001
They won't.

121
00:14:27.168 --> 00:14:32.168
They won't. if everybody is
where they should be.

122
00:14:32.335 --> 00:14:35.501
The soldiers are in one place.
and the officers in another.

123
00:14:35.668 --> 00:14:38.876
Soldiers with no officers
will cause panic.

124
00:14:39.043 --> 00:14:42.001
It's that simple. Comrade Lieutenant.

125
00:14:48.876 --> 00:14:50.543
I understand. Pyotr Mikhailovich.

126
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:53.585
And I think that our conversation
has been very useful.

127
00:14:55.293 --> 00:14:57.293
I am asking you to keep this secret.

128
00:14:58.335 --> 00:15:01.918
The hearing for your case
will be on the 27th.

129
00:15:03.126 --> 00:15:07.751
May I leave. Comrade Lieutenant?
There is a film show at the club.

130
00:15:07.918 --> 00:15:09.293
Yes.

131
00:15:51.335 --> 00:15:57.043
So. Sonya... Sonya.
Will you stay?

132
00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:59.085
Look at the way people are living.

133
00:15:59.251 --> 00:16:03.293
<i>Anyuta. I've been wanting to tell you
for a long time...</i>

134
00:16:48.751 --> 00:16:51.335
Thank you. Comrade Major.

135
00:17:35.335 --> 00:17:39.501
- The tea's gone cold.
- Go to sleep. Katyusha.

136
00:18:05.918 --> 00:18:11.668
<i>German saboteurs had infiltrated
Brest wearing our uniforms.</i>

137
00:18:13.043 --> 00:18:18.001
<i>They were responsible for cutting off
the fortress's water and light.</i>

138
00:18:24.793 --> 00:18:26.251
What's the matter?

139
00:18:26.418 --> 00:18:30.251
Another Polish deserter
was caught at the post.

140
00:18:31.293 --> 00:18:33.668
He said the war
will begin tonight at 4.00.

141
00:18:35.751 --> 00:18:38.710
- Do you believe him?
- Of course not.

142
00:18:38.876 --> 00:18:40.751
We have caught 10 like him.

143
00:18:40.918 --> 00:18:44.293
and each of them says today.
on the 8th of August.

144
00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.085
I am upset because of Anya.

145
00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:50.876
The girl has grown up.
She used to tell me everything.

146
00:18:51.043 --> 00:18:53.793
and now I'm lucky
if I get a word out of her.

147
00:18:56.126 --> 00:18:58.210
Perhaps she is ill?

148
00:18:59.251 --> 00:19:04.293
Sashka Akimov â€” that's the name of
the ailment. Our Anya is in love.

149
00:19:07.585 --> 00:19:09.293
So there you are. Daddy.

150
00:19:12.001 --> 00:19:16.460
Sasha. Remember you promised
to take me fishing?

151
00:19:16.626 --> 00:19:22.293
- Anya. your parents won't let you go.
- I'll sneak out at night.

152
00:19:23.335 --> 00:19:28.126
All right... Anya. you keep playing.
and I'm off for a smoke.

153
00:19:54.876 --> 00:20:00.793
- Let's get married.
- I don't remember you asking me.

154
00:20:02.335 --> 00:20:03.918
You don't think I will?

155
00:20:05.001 --> 00:20:07.960
- I'll be right back.
- Wait.

156
00:20:10.293 --> 00:20:12.210
Just wait a minute.

157
00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:58.751
- Hello.
- Name?

158
00:20:58.918 --> 00:21:03.335
Nikolai. I've brought the film.

159
00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:44.043
JUNE 22. 1941
03.58

160
00:23:55.793 --> 00:23:58.710
A drill? They won't let us sleep.

161
00:24:04.251 --> 00:24:05.918
What is it?

162
00:24:07.918 --> 00:24:09.751
I'll go and see what's happening.

163
00:24:13.918 --> 00:24:15.960
Get down!

164
00:24:17.001 --> 00:24:20.001
- What is it?
- A drill.

165
00:24:39.751 --> 00:24:41.543
- Run!
- Where?

166
00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:44.168
- Home. I'll find you.
- What about you?

167
00:24:45.168 --> 00:24:48.001
- Where's Anya?
- Calm down. we'll find her.

168
00:25:00.418 --> 00:25:02.501
Is it war?

169
00:25:04.376 --> 00:25:08.001
- Katya! Quickly.
- Did you take everything?

170
00:25:09.043 --> 00:25:10.668
Run.

171
00:25:28.001 --> 00:25:33.043
Katya. do what I taught you.
Hide in the furthest cellar.

172
00:25:34.085 --> 00:25:35.460
Take it easy!

173
00:25:35.626 --> 00:25:38.960
- Come on. son.
- Your cap.

174
00:25:39.126 --> 00:25:42.501
I'll come and get you as soon as
everything quietens down.

175
00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:53.168
She'll be able to find us.
won't she?

176
00:25:53.335 --> 00:25:54.960
Stay here.

177
00:25:55.126 --> 00:25:57.501
- And you?
- I'll be fine.

178
00:26:00.376 --> 00:26:03.751
I am going to regimental
headquarters. Run. Run!

179
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:14.085
Take her away.

180
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:32.960
Let's go! Come on. get going!

181
00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.835
<i>I had imagined what war
would be like.</i>

182
00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:57.126
<i>But I hadn't imagined
anything like this.</i>

183
00:28:57.293 --> 00:29:04.501
<i>Everybody had been waiting for it.
but nobody expected it so suddenly.</i>

184
00:29:05.543 --> 00:29:08.710
<i>Ordinary and terrible.</i>

185
00:29:42.418 --> 00:29:48.960
<i>I ran to that house. It was
an assembly point in the event of war.</i>

186
00:30:00.501 --> 00:30:03.835
<i>That's what was written
in the roster.</i>

187
00:30:04.001 --> 00:30:09.543
<i>But it was there. in a building
that had already been destroyed.</i>

188
00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:14.168
Stop! No weapons without orders
from the officers!

189
00:30:14.335 --> 00:30:15.668
Hurry up!

190
00:30:21.501 --> 00:30:23.418
<i>I didn't get a weapon.</i>

191
00:30:26.376 --> 00:30:29.501
<i>But I had my own weapon.</i>

192
00:30:32.335 --> 00:30:36.293
<i>And no permission
was required for that.</i>

193
00:31:12.918 --> 00:31:15.293
Everything seems
to have gone quiet.

194
00:32:29.835 --> 00:32:34.001
Son. crawl into the cellar.

195
00:32:47.251 --> 00:32:49.210
Run. Run. son.

Boy. play.
It doesn't matter what. just play.

205
00:34:15.835 --> 00:34:17.085
Stop! Stop!

206
00:34:20.501 --> 00:34:23.085
Have you gone mad? Get out of here!

207
00:34:23.251 --> 00:34:24.918
- Where are the weapons?
- Get lost!

208
00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:35.751
Officers. come here!

209
00:34:36.543 --> 00:34:39.043
We're here.
We are lieutenants.

210
00:34:39.793 --> 00:34:41.460
Lieutenants... I don't see it!

211
00:34:41.626 --> 00:34:45.251
Pull yourselves together and report.
or I will have you shot for scaremongering.

212
00:34:45.418 --> 00:34:46.751
Yes. sir.

213
00:34:46.918 --> 00:34:50.960
Back to the barracks! Get your weapons
and take up your positions!

214

00:35:04.001 --> 00:35:07.585
- We were trained for this.
- What were we trained for?

218
00:35:07.751 --> 00:35:09.751
- What?!

219
00:35:09.918 --> 00:35:12.376
It's my fault.
Comrade Regiment Commissar.

Don't let the Germans cross
the bridge. Save the ammo.

225
00:35:35.668 --> 00:35:37.335
Don't stop trying to get
a radio link.

226

We don't have enough!
They're buried in the rubble.

230
00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:49.585
- The Political Commissar?
- Dead!

231
00:35:54.168 --> 00:35:57.751
Everybody who has a weapon
come with me. The rest of you....

232
00:35:57.918 --> 00:36:00.376
See what you can get
out of the rubble.

233
00:36:01.918 --> 00:36:03.835
Germans!

234
00:36:49.543 --> 00:36:51.335

Fortress here. We are defending our
position. We are engaged in fighting.

238
00:38:34.793 --> 00:38:36.251
Waiting for reinforcements.

239
00:38:37.251 --> 00:38:39.793
THE BARRACKS
OF THE 13TH NKVD BATALLION

240
00:38:49.918 --> 00:38:52.960
What sort of unit is this?
Who is in charge?

241
00:38:54.001 --> 00:38:57.751
Bring the officer to me.
Bring the officer in charge to me!

Carry out the order. Lieutenant!

250
00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:40.293
Two regiments have already
moved from Korbin to help.

251
00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:43.793
It makes no sense
to sacrifice people.

252
00:39:45.251 --> 00:39:47.960
- And you. Sergeant!
- Staff Sergeant Novikov.

253

263
00:40:43.418 --> 00:40:49.085
- The tag is German.

271
00:43:20.293 --> 00:43:23.168
Kolya. I can't go on like this.
Kolya. I'm so afraid.

272
00:43:23.335 --> 00:43:24.710
Quiet.

278
00:44:34.585 --> 00:44:36.835
There. there. Look.

279
00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:45.793
That's the nurse who treated my ear.

280
00:44:49.376 --> 00:44:51.168
What will we do.
Comrade Commissar?

281
00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:56.918

Everybody man the windows. Aim at

Get down!

285
00:46:42.751 --> 00:46:44.418

What will we do. Vanya?

306
00:51:25.751 --> 00:51:27.835

Let's go back.
We can't get through here.

314
00:54:05.918 --> 00:54:08.501
Fortress calling. fortress calling.

315
00:54:08.668 --> 00:54:10.751

<i>The first order to retreat was
issued by the German command</i>

339
00:59:55.251 --> 01:00:01.918
<i>on June @2 1941
.
at 1 1 o'clock in the morning</i>

340
01:00:02.085 --> 01:00:04.960
<i>here in the Brest Fortress.</i>

341
01:00:05.126 --> 01:00:07.793
We have 18 left
capable of bearing arms.

342
01:00:08.835 --> 01:00:11.376
There is no medicine. water or food.

343
01:00:12.668 --> 01:00:16.126
What do you think? Where are
our reinforcements? Are they coming?

344
01:00:16.293 --> 01:00:19.585
Will they be here soon?
What should I tell the soldiers?

345
01:00:29.835 --> 01:00:36.876
They will be here by morning.
for certain. For certain.

346
01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:58.751
- Well? Have they all been buried?
- Yes.

347
01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:23.168
- What about the water?
- There's an icebox in the cellar.

348
01:01:23.335 --> 01:01:25.668
- Enough for one day.
- And then?

349
01:01:25.835 --> 01:01:30.585
Comrade Major. tomorrow our lads
will chase them off.

350
01:02:22.835 --> 01:02:26.418
It's dangerous to stay here.
The building has been badly damaged.

351
01:02:26.585 --> 01:02:32.126
Follow me. Take cover in the barracks
cellar until reinforcements arrive.

352
01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:01.918
- Where is Anya?
- I thought she was with you.

353
01:03:08.793 --> 01:03:10.751
I have to go.

354
01:03:21.876 --> 01:03:25.793
<i>I didn't know what was happening.</i>

355
01:03:26.835 --> 01:03:30.210
<i>I didn't know what to do
or where to go.</i>

356
01:03:31.668 --> 01:03:35.793
<i>All I knew was that I had to survive
until morning.</i>

357
01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:41.918
<i>In the morning our men would arrive
and it would all be over.</i>

358
01:04:28.001 --> 01:04:32.085
<i>Soldiers. officers!</i>

359
01:04:32.251 --> 01:04:39.460
<i>You are faced with a choice:
die in a hail of bullets.</i>

360
01:04:39.626 --> 01:04:44.126
<i>or have the bravery
to surrender and live.</i>

361
01:04:44.293 --> 01:04:50.960
<i>Your situation is hopeless.
Your fight is hopeless.</i>

362
01:04:51.126 --> 01:04:57.460
<i>We have come to free your country
from Yids and Bolsheviks.</i>

363
01:04:58.501 --> 01:05:05.043
<i>We will create a new life
without any back-breaking work.</i>

364
01:05:06.251 --> 01:05:09.460
<i>Surrender and you will live.</i>

365
01:05:09.626 --> 01:05:11.710
Let me shoot them.

366
01:05:18.876 --> 01:05:24.085
No. don't. Everyone has
his own choice.

367
01:05:29.626 --> 01:05:31.293
Here. give me your hand!

368
01:05:42.751 --> 01:05:47.085
Comrade Lieutenant.
please let me report.

369
01:05:47.251 --> 01:05:51.918
Akimov Alexander.
333rd military band regiment.

370
01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:57.043
- Take him to the cellar.
- Comrade Lieutenant. where is Anya?

371
01:05:58.376 --> 01:06:01.126
- What?
- Anya?

372
01:06:06.918 --> 01:06:09.501
I saw her running towards you.

373
01:06:12.668 --> 01:06:15.960
- Put him in the cellar. Quickly.
- Let me go!

374
01:06:16.126 --> 01:06:20.293
- Stop! Where are you going?
- I'll find her!

375
01:06:21.335 --> 01:06:25.960
Akimov! Sashka!

376
01:06:26.126 --> 01:06:29.085
I'll find her!

377
01:07:12.335 --> 01:07:17.168
Don't! No! No. no. no!

378
01:07:21.876 --> 01:07:25.626
Stop! Please!

379
01:07:54.793 --> 01:08:00.543
No! Don't shoot!
Don't kill me. please...

380
01:08:10.210 --> 01:08:13.251
Don't! Please!

381
01:09:07.168 --> 01:09:10.293
- Drag him over here.
- Report to Fomin.

382
01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:13.543
- Quickly. Quickly. quickly!
- Quiet. boys.

383
01:09:13.710 --> 01:09:17.335
- Commissar. we've got a captive!
- Nurses. come here!

384
01:09:17.501 --> 01:09:20.918
<i>I remember Fomin and Zubachev.</i>

385
01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:26.126
<i>Their small division
at the Kholmsky Gate.</i>

386
01:09:27.418 --> 01:09:29.793
<i>They didn't let the enemy
over the bridge.</i>

387
01:09:31.543 --> 01:09:35.376
<i>I saw a captive German
for the first time here.</i>

388
01:09:37.626 --> 01:09:41.168
Maslov! What is he saying?

389
01:09:45.585 --> 01:09:49.043
He says:
"More than likely to take Minsk."

390
01:09:54.376 --> 01:09:58.835
He says: "You're in the rear.
right at the rear."

391
01:09:59.001 --> 01:10:02.460
Why are you talking about Minsk?
What did you come here for?!

392
01:10:02.626 --> 01:10:04.793
Why did you come here?

393
01:10:06.543 --> 01:10:08.043
You're lying.

394
01:10:12.876 --> 01:10:16.918
Comrade. Comrade Commissar. look!

395
01:10:23.293 --> 01:10:24.876
Our men.

396
01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:22.460
Behind you! Behind you!

397
01:12:28.126 --> 01:12:30.751
Alive? Well done.

398
01:12:34.001 --> 01:12:36.501
Come on. come on.

399
01:12:56.751 --> 01:12:58.126
Lieutenant Karelin.

400
01:12:59.126 --> 01:13:02.710
- 123rd fighting regiment.
- Regiment Commissar Fomin.

401
01:13:04.376 --> 01:13:08.626
Tell me.
what's happening in Brest. Kurbin?

402
01:13:08.793 --> 01:13:12.835
Why is our air force doing nothing?
Where are our men?

403
01:13:13.001 --> 01:13:15.668
There are no aerodromes.
Comrade Commissar.

404
01:13:16.710 --> 01:13:20.376
They have all been destroyed.
There are Germans in Brest.

405
01:13:20.543 --> 01:13:24.210
Our troops are retreating to Minsk.

406
01:14:45.126 --> 01:14:46.501
Comrades.

407
01:14:49.501 --> 01:14:51.335
Soldiers.

408
01:14:55.210 --> 01:14:58.335
The Germans are asking us
to surrender.

409
01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:04.210
They are offering us
a cowardly life in captivity.

410
01:15:07.543 --> 01:15:09.626
They are making a mistake.

411
01:15:10.876 --> 01:15:15.085
We are Red Army soldiers
and we will protect our motherland

412
01:15:15.251 --> 01:15:16.918
to our dying breath.

413
01:15:18.626 --> 01:15:22.793
That is the only choice for us.

414
01:15:30.751 --> 01:15:33.335
JUNE 24th.

415
01:16:06.168 --> 01:16:11.585
- Uncle. may I have a drop of water?
- There isn't any. my dear.

416
01:16:11.751 --> 01:16:14.335
There is. Please give it to me.

417
01:17:10.043 --> 01:17:14.085
- Kostya. where is your family?
- I don't know.

418
01:17:15.168 --> 01:17:22.460
I left them at home. in the cellar.
Now. I don't know.

419
01:17:24.835 --> 01:17:30.043
I don't know what's happened
to mine either.

420
01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:03.126
You can't drink that.
It's petrol.

421
01:18:06.793 --> 01:18:11.376
<i>I remember that morning. or day.</i>

422
01:18:11.543 --> 01:18:14.835
<i>I woke up and saw hands.</i>

423
01:18:15.001 --> 01:18:21.251
<i>Kovalenok's hands. He was carving
a whistle out of wood for me.</i>

424
01:18:21.418 --> 01:18:26.085
<i>I looked at it and thought.
what do I need it for?</i>

425
01:18:26.251 --> 01:18:31.501
Let's regroup and try to break out.
Nobody will be looking for us here.

426
01:18:34.501 --> 01:18:40.001
Tonight. or we will lose everyone.
We need to get out right away.

427
01:18:40.168 --> 01:18:42.668
- One by one.
- Where are we going to break out to?

428
01:18:42.835 --> 01:18:47.460
The fortress is surrounded. Brest has
been taken. To captivity? To a camp?

429
01:18:47.626 --> 01:18:52.001
- Where? To death?
- We are dead. Comrade Officer.

430
01:18:52.168 --> 01:18:56.376
Yes. Many will die.
Possibly everyone.

431
01:18:59.043 --> 01:19:03.918
We should fight while we have strength.
We need to break out.

432
01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:10.376
- Write an order.
- Number?

433
01:19:15.168 --> 01:19:17.043
Order number 1.

434
01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:23.835
June 24. 1941. Fortress.

435
01:19:24.876 --> 01:19:29.168
The situation in the fortress
requires us to leave immediately.

436
01:19:31.793 --> 01:19:34.043
Cross out "us to leave immediately".

437
01:19:41.293 --> 01:19:48.168
Write "organised military action.
for further engagement with the enemy."

438
01:19:50.210 --> 01:19:55.251
Officers. Division Commissar Fomin.

439
01:19:57.376 --> 01:19:58.751
Captain Zubachev.

440
01:20:00.835 --> 01:20:02.251
Lieutenant Vinogradov.

441
01:20:03.293 --> 01:20:04.918
The decision was made

442
01:20:06.751 --> 01:20:14.043
to unite the remaining forces
into a composite group.

443
01:20:17.376 --> 01:20:23.001
The unified force.
tonight. on June 24th.

444
01:20:24.543 --> 01:20:26.126
will try to break out...

445
01:20:29.001 --> 01:20:35.251
to break out...
to unite with the Red Army regulars.

446
01:20:38.043 --> 01:20:39.501
The Red Army...

447
01:20:42.210 --> 01:20:44.835
To continue the fight against
the fascist invaders.

448
01:20:46.001 --> 01:20:49.293
- Again! God damn it!
- Germans on the bridge!

449
01:20:49.460 --> 01:20:52.918
- Places. everyone!
- Take your positions!

450
01:21:05.418 --> 01:21:10.626
Fortress calling.
We are engaged in fighting.

451
01:21:11.668 --> 01:21:15.168
Defending our position.
waiting for reinforcements.

452
01:21:15.335 --> 01:21:18.793
Valenko! Come!

453
01:21:19.835 --> 01:21:26.668
Judging by the shooting around
the Tirespol Gate and the Eastern Fort.

454
01:21:26.835 --> 01:21:29.501
our men are still fighting there.

455
01:21:29.668 --> 01:21:31.043
Follow me.

456
01:21:31.210 --> 01:21:34.793
Try to break through
to them at any cost.

457
01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:41.085
Report the current situation and
tell them of our plans to break out.

458
01:21:41.251 --> 01:21:47.210
Try to get there before the breakout
and come back here. Alive!

459
01:21:47.376 --> 01:21:50.835
- Comrade Commissar. may I go?
- Permission denied.

460
01:21:51.001 --> 01:21:54.876
- Drink some water. That's all I have.
- Give it to the wounded.

461
01:21:55.043 --> 01:21:56.918
- Do it.
- Sir!

462
01:21:58.460 --> 01:22:00.626
Take it to the wounded
in the cellar. Do it!

463
01:22:00.793 --> 01:22:02.168
Sir!

464
01:22:05.918 --> 01:22:07.293
OK. OK. I got it.

465
01:22:17.251 --> 01:22:21.835
Take a look. Calm down.
Everything is OK.

466
01:22:22.001 --> 01:22:23.835
Finish on your own.

467
01:22:42.376 --> 01:22:43.751
Doctor.

468
01:22:46.168 --> 01:22:47.626
Doctor.

469
01:23:40.001 --> 01:23:46.835
On Saturday they delivered cold
mineral water to the exchange post.

470
01:24:19.835 --> 01:24:21.376
Into the cellars!

471
01:26:12.043 --> 01:26:14.501
I didn't make it.
I didn't make it. Sashka.

472
01:26:14.668 --> 01:26:18.835
Go to the Eastern Fort.
Our men are there. Give the order.

473
01:26:19.001 --> 01:26:25.168
- The breakout is tonight.
- I'll tell them.

474
01:26:26.918 --> 01:26:33.251
<i>I knew that nothing would happen
to me. because I...</i>

475
01:26:35.335 --> 01:26:38.585
<i>I was destined
to deliver this order.</i>

476
01:29:14.293 --> 01:29:15.668
Anya.

477
01:29:18.043 --> 01:29:22.876
There's no way out of here
at the moment. Stay here.

478
01:29:25.001 --> 01:29:31.251
I'm afraid I can't stay with you. though.
I have an order to deliver.

479
01:29:31.418 --> 01:29:33.293
Are you listening to me?

480
01:29:36.543 --> 01:29:38.960
Do you hear me?

481
01:31:34.543 --> 01:31:36.626
<i>There was no water.</i>

482
01:31:38.210 --> 01:31:45.501
<i>Or. to be more accurate. there was
but we couldn't get to it.</i>

483
01:31:45.668 --> 01:31:49.418
<i>All approaches
to the river bank were under fire.</i>

484
01:31:52.210 --> 01:31:59.501
<i>People died for just
a pot of water. for a mouthful.</i>

485
01:32:02.668 --> 01:32:09.960
<i>And the little that they did bring.
they kept for the machine guns.</i>

486
01:32:52.835 --> 01:32:55.960
Comrade Major. permission to report.

487
01:32:57.001 --> 01:33:00.085
Akimov. 333rd military band regiment.

488
01:33:02.085 --> 01:33:06.626
I have an order. Tonight
there will be a mass breakout.

489
01:33:06.793 --> 01:33:09.918
The signal will be a red flare.

490
01:33:24.168 --> 01:33:29.376
I am lucky... with Akimovs.

491
01:34:52.793 --> 01:34:54.543
It's time.

492
01:35:07.168 --> 01:35:08.543
Follow me.

493
01:35:15.210 --> 01:35:17.085
Let's go.

494
01:35:22.293 --> 01:35:23.668
Forward.

495
01:36:20.085 --> 01:36:23.210
Follow me!

496
01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:26.918
Save the ammo!

497
01:36:47.293 --> 01:36:49.376
Let's go. Let's go.

498
01:37:07.626 --> 01:37:10.251
- Tereshenko. what's wrong?
- It's my shoulder!

499
01:37:11.793 --> 01:37:15.043
- Pelechenko. help him.
- Sir.

500
01:37:15.210 --> 01:37:16.793
- Give me your hand.
- I can do it!

501
01:38:26.751 --> 01:38:29.293
Everybody withdraw!
Withdraw!

502
01:38:32.668 --> 01:38:35.043
Retreat!

503
01:38:37.585 --> 01:38:39.335
We're retreating!

504
01:39:52.293 --> 01:39:54.585
Comrade Doctor.

505
01:40:03.001 --> 01:40:10.293
I did everything I could.

506
01:43:15.376 --> 01:43:22.668
