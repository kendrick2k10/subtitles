3
00:02:35.503 --> 00:02:37.766
I didn't want to believe
in the beginning.

4
00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:39.898
what happened to Jamal.

5
00:02:39.942 --> 00:02:41.813
Prominent Saudi journalist

6
00:02:41.857 --> 00:02:43.554
andWashington Post columnist

7
00:02:43.598 --> 00:02:45.339
has gone missing
after visiting

8
00:02:45.382 --> 00:02:47.210
his country's consulate
in Istanbul.

9
00:02:50.866 --> 00:02:54.652
Yes. I knew that I was
doing something dangerous.

10
00:02:54.696 --> 00:02:56.480
But I didn't know that.
you know.

11
00:02:56.524 --> 00:02:59.440
we're going to lose
so many lives because of it.

12
00:03:01.093 --> 00:03:02.965
On Tuesday. Jamal Khashoggi

13
00:03:03.008 --> 00:03:04.575
entered the Saudi consulate

14
00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:06.621
in Istanbul
but hasn't been seen since.

15
00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:10.015
Saudi and Turkish officials

16
00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:11.887
have given conflicting accounts

17
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.932
on the whereabouts
of Jamal Khashoggi.

18
00:03:13.976 --> 00:03:15.499
who's known for criticizing

19
00:03:15.543 --> 00:03:18.154
Crown Prince Mohammed
bin Salman's policy

20
00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:20.025
inside Saudi Arabia.

21
00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.853
Once an adviser and friend

22
00:03:21.897 --> 00:03:23.638
of Saudi's royal and elites.

23
00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:26.336
he now lives in self-exile
in the U.S.

24
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.210
and is an outspoken critic
of his government's policies.

25
00:03:47.792 --> 00:03:49.272
Turkish authorities believe

26
00:03:49.316 --> 00:03:51.100
prominent Saudi journalist.

27
00:03:51.143 --> 00:03:53.233
Jamal Khashoggi.
has been killed.

28
00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.252
...what I want in my retirement.

29
00:06:23.295 --> 00:06:25.863
I'm 60 years old.
and I want to enjoy life.

30
00:06:25.907 --> 00:06:27.212
and I want to be free.

31
00:06:27.256 --> 00:06:28.997
Unfortunately.
the government treated me

32
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.739
as if I shot the King.
God forbid. and I ran away.

33
00:06:31.782 --> 00:06:32.914
As I am a traitor.

34
00:06:34.872 --> 00:06:37.440
After his death.

35
00:06:37.484 --> 00:06:39.007
Jamal became a hero.

36
00:06:40.443 --> 00:06:45.143
We cry when we hear
that the hero is killed.

37
00:06:45.187 --> 00:06:47.494
But his works.

38
00:06:47.537 --> 00:06:51.193
his cause. his vision.

39
00:06:51.236 --> 00:06:52.847
it would live forever.

40
00:06:54.718 --> 00:06:57.504
What do you know
about the bees?

41
00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:27.523
We know from here that

42
00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:30.395
he entered this embassy
and didn't come out.

43
00:09:30.439 --> 00:09:33.529
...in Istanbul. seekingpaperwork to marry his fiancée.

44
00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:36.488
His fiancée saw him
go in at 1:00 p.m.

45
00:09:36.532 --> 00:09:39.796
and was still waiting
for him after 1:00 a.m.

46
00:10:17.834 --> 00:10:19.967
MALE REPORTER 1 :
Saudi officials
have denied that

47
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:22.839
a prominent Saudi journalist
is in their custody.

48
00:10:22.883 --> 00:10:25.537
Jamal Khashoggi has
reportedly been missing

49
00:10:25.581 --> 00:10:27.235
for more than 24 hours.

50
00:10:27.278 --> 00:10:29.324
Turkey says that
they will be cooperating

51
00:10:29.367 --> 00:10:32.240
with Saudi authorities
to resolve the incident.

52
00:10:32.283 --> 00:10:34.808
The consulate said
it had no comment

53
00:10:34.851 --> 00:10:37.724
when asked why
he never came out.

54
00:10:40.117 --> 00:10:42.467
Can you tell me what
happened to Mr. Khashoggi?

55
00:10:42.511 --> 00:10:44.208
What happened
to Mr. Khashoggi?

56
00:10:45.993 --> 00:10:47.385
Did you talk to him?

57
00:10:55.785 --> 00:10:56.873
Okay.

58
00:10:58.875 --> 00:11:00.181
Jamal--

59
00:11:00.224 --> 00:11:01.791
Jamal Khashoggi.

60
00:11:01.835 --> 00:11:04.228
Jamal Ahmad Khashoggi.

61
00:11:09.973 --> 00:11:11.583
Right. Okay.

62
00:12:07.204 --> 00:12:09.163
What year was that.
Jamal. that you graduated?

63
00:12:09.206 --> 00:12:11.513
-Eighty-one. Yes.
-Nineteen eighty-one?

64
00:12:11.556 --> 00:12:14.037
Business Administration degree from Indiana State.

65
00:12:14.081 --> 00:12:17.301
But since then. I'm happy
to see from his biography.

66
00:12:17.345 --> 00:12:20.217
Jamal is a rara avis.
at least in our society.

67
00:12:20.261 --> 00:12:23.090
full-time long-term
professional journalist.

68
00:12:23.133 --> 00:12:25.657
He doesn't seem tempted
to be doing anything else.

69
00:12:45.982 --> 00:12:47.549
Saudi Arabia is a monarchy.

70
00:12:47.592 --> 00:12:50.160
I mean. the king has ruled
that it should happen.

71
00:14:52.195 --> 00:14:54.545
-On Twitter?
-On Twitter.

72
00:14:57.026 --> 00:14:59.202
I was criticizing everything

73
00:14:59.246 --> 00:15:01.683
except the royal family.

74
00:15:04.729 --> 00:15:07.384
But I didn't have
a very huge audience.

75
00:15:07.428 --> 00:15:10.387
I was just a regular guy
with hundred followers.

76
00:17:02.325 --> 00:17:04.284
The Saudi King's jet carries

77
00:17:04.327 --> 00:17:06.068
its own royal staircase.

78
00:17:06.112 --> 00:17:08.505
Waiting at the bottom of it at Gatwick Airport this morning

79
00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:10.333
were the Prince
and Princess of Wales.

80
00:17:10.377 --> 00:17:13.510
The king of one
of the most closed
societies in the world

81
00:17:13.554 --> 00:17:16.078
looking at ease
in this more open one.

82
00:17:16.122 --> 00:17:17.775
The Saudi government
and the monarchy

83
00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:21.649
has evolved significantly
over the last 80 years.

84
00:17:21.692 --> 00:17:24.043
basically.
since the kingdom was founded.

85
00:17:27.263 --> 00:17:29.222
The founder of Saudi Arabia.
King Abdulaziz.

86
00:17:29.265 --> 00:17:31.485
had about 37 sons or so.

87
00:17:31.528 --> 00:17:33.965
And political power.
as well as economic power.

88
00:17:34.009 --> 00:17:36.185
was distributed
among those sons.

89
00:17:36.229 --> 00:17:39.319
A pivotal country
saw a lavish welcome

90
00:17:39.362 --> 00:17:40.842
for the man who controls

91
00:17:40.885 --> 00:17:43.323
nearly half the world's
oil reserves.

92
00:17:44.802 --> 00:17:46.935
Once King Abdulaziz died.

93
00:17:46.978 --> 00:17:48.241
the crown was passed through

94
00:17:48.284 --> 00:17:49.633
to his son.

95
00:17:49.677 --> 00:17:52.027
to his son. to his son.

96
00:17:53.202 --> 00:17:55.248
King Salman became the king

97
00:17:55.291 --> 00:17:57.989
and the game
has completely changed.

98
00:18:00.601 --> 00:18:02.429
A new king
reigns in a country

99
00:18:02.472 --> 00:18:04.300
with enormous sway
over the world economy

100
00:18:04.344 --> 00:18:06.389
and the war on terror.

101
00:18:07.999 --> 00:18:10.567
While in the past. the king really had to rely on

102
00:18:10.611 --> 00:18:14.876
a lot of his brothers in order to govern the kingdom.

103
00:18:14.919 --> 00:18:16.921
When they passed
from the scene.

104
00:18:16.965 --> 00:18:18.662
more and more powers
concentrated

105
00:18:18.706 --> 00:18:22.449
in the hands of his heirs.

106
00:18:22.492 --> 00:18:24.364
and that's the situation
we have today.

107
00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.598
Saudi Arabia has granted

108
00:18:41.642 --> 00:18:45.167
Turkish investigators permission to enter and search.

109
00:22:02.233 --> 00:22:04.061
This is history.

110
00:22:04.105 --> 00:22:06.934
Protesters forcing change earlier this year in Tunisia.

111
00:22:06.977 --> 00:22:09.371
now succeeding
in forcing change in Egypt

112
00:22:09.415 --> 00:22:12.679
after nearly 30 years
of Mubarak rule.

113
00:22:14.158 --> 00:22:17.205
That's two Arab leaders
in two months.

114
00:22:28.259 --> 00:22:29.826
Arab governments are watching closely.

115
00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:31.872
wary that a revolution
might be headed

116
00:22:31.915 --> 00:22:33.569
to their country next.

117
00:22:57.941 --> 00:23:00.379
The military's crackdown
on opposition in Egypt

118
00:23:00.422 --> 00:23:04.034
had resulted in over
14.000 people thrown in jail.

119
00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:26.203
John. good morning.

120
00:24:26.247 --> 00:24:27.727
I'm on a new phone.

121
00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:29.555
Uh. this is temporary.

122
00:24:29.598 --> 00:24:34.995
Let's not exchange sensitive
information until you arrive.

123
00:24:35.038 --> 00:24:37.563
But this is how to get
in touch with me until then.

124
00:24:40.348 --> 00:24:42.959
I tell people
that Jamal and I

125
00:24:43.003 --> 00:24:46.180
were not supposed
to be friends.

126
00:24:46.223 --> 00:24:49.052
I mean. I'm a pretty
well-known dissident.

127
00:24:49.096 --> 00:24:53.970
But in 2012. he started
following me on Twitter.

128
00:24:54.014 --> 00:24:56.190
He was very interested
in social media

129
00:24:56.233 --> 00:24:57.931
in terms of the phenomena.

130
00:24:59.889 --> 00:25:03.719
Saudi Arabia has
an unprecedented
online population.

131
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:09.551
We know that
there's no free speech.

132
00:25:09.595 --> 00:25:12.641
So. Twitter became
the parliament of the Arabs.

133
00:25:42.671 --> 00:25:44.586
...already proposed a series

134
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:46.022
of economic and social changes

135
00:25:46.066 --> 00:25:49.373
under the banner
of Saudi Vision 2030.

136
00:25:49.417 --> 00:25:52.028
The highly anticipated
2030 Vision

137
00:25:52.072 --> 00:25:55.379
seems to radically change
the image of the Kingdom.

138
00:25:55.423 --> 00:25:57.077
The man behind it all.

139
00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.514
Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman.

140
00:25:59.558 --> 00:26:01.995
is regarded
as a progressive leader.

141
00:26:02.038 --> 00:26:04.824
touting social
and economic reforms.

142
00:26:10.438 --> 00:26:12.092
And critics say. MBS.

143
00:26:12.135 --> 00:26:15.182
as he's known.
is also power hungry.

144
00:26:15.225 --> 00:26:16.923
I had met Mohammed Salman

145
00:26:16.966 --> 00:26:19.665
when he was Chief of Staff
to his father.

146
00:26:21.014 --> 00:26:24.452
We understood
that he was very ambitious.

147
00:26:24.495 --> 00:26:28.412
a very impatient.
and a favorite son.

148
00:26:29.805 --> 00:26:31.764
He pushed aside
King Salman's half-brother.

149
00:26:31.807 --> 00:26:35.768
Prince Muqrin and the Crown
Prince. Muhammad Nayef.

150
00:26:35.811 --> 00:26:39.336
He's being described as the power behind the throne.

151
00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:42.383
and has had a hand in nearly
everything in the Kingdom.

152
00:26:42.426 --> 00:26:44.385
He is emancipating women.

153
00:26:44.428 --> 00:26:46.213
introducing music and cinema.

154
00:26:46.256 --> 00:26:48.432
and cracking down
on corruption.

155
00:27:17.244 --> 00:27:18.680
This is an American first.

156
00:27:18.724 --> 00:27:20.464
never before has a president
set foot

157
00:27:20.508 --> 00:27:23.685
on Saudi soil
for his first trip abroad.

158
00:27:32.738 --> 00:27:37.438
America will not seek to impose
our way of life on others.

159
00:27:37.481 --> 00:27:40.093
but to outstretch our hands

160
00:27:40.136 --> 00:27:43.705
in the spirit
of cooperation and trust.

161
00:27:43.749 --> 00:27:45.359
What my sources told me

162
00:27:45.402 --> 00:27:47.840
was the Saudis and Mohammed
bin Salman. in particular.

163
00:27:47.883 --> 00:27:49.319
were trying to forge
a relationship

164
00:27:49.363 --> 00:27:51.147
with people
in The White House.

165
00:27:51.191 --> 00:27:54.107
and most particularly
with Jared Kushner.

166
00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:56.457
who's the President's
son-in-law and Senior Advisor.

167
00:28:07.555 --> 00:28:09.731
Three billion dollars.

168
00:28:09.775 --> 00:28:12.603
$533 million.

169
00:28:12.647 --> 00:28:15.694
$525 million.

170
00:28:15.737 --> 00:28:17.130
That's peanuts for you.

171
00:28:17.173 --> 00:28:19.175
You should've increased it.
Eight hundred...

172
00:28:26.487 --> 00:28:29.533
He said that he's milking
the country.

173
00:28:37.672 --> 00:28:39.718
I'm sure
Saudi Arabian officials

174
00:28:39.761 --> 00:28:40.980
were caught off-guard

175
00:28:41.023 --> 00:28:43.460
by the election
of Mr. Trump. Now...

176
00:28:43.504 --> 00:28:47.160
I think all of us. as Saudis.
should worry about it.

177
00:28:47.203 --> 00:28:51.468
I strongly believe that
the struggle for democracy

178
00:28:51.512 --> 00:28:54.645
in the Middle East
are the core of all problems.

179
00:29:16.972 --> 00:29:19.105
When Jamal heard
that statement.

180
00:29:19.148 --> 00:29:20.584
he was shocked.

181
00:29:24.066 --> 00:29:25.372
By 2017.

182
00:29:25.415 --> 00:29:28.897
Jamal had an enormous audience.

183
00:29:28.941 --> 00:29:34.250
MBS put together a plan
to control the public sphere.

184
00:29:34.294 --> 00:29:37.819
Saud al-Qahtani.
MBS's right-hand man.

185
00:29:37.863 --> 00:29:40.082
managed
to implement this plan...

186
00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.825
...creating Twitter army
of trolls

187
00:29:43.869 --> 00:29:46.959
to control
the freedom of speech.

188
00:29:47.002 --> 00:29:48.612
Al-Qahtani worked behind the scenes

189
00:29:48.656 --> 00:29:50.571
as an enforcer
for the Crown Prince.

190
00:29:50.614 --> 00:29:52.225
Qahtani was known
for targeting those

191
00:29:52.268 --> 00:29:55.445
who spoke out
against Riyadh on Twitter.

192
00:30:48.803 --> 00:30:50.239
They're not dissidents.

193
00:30:50.283 --> 00:30:53.852
The people were
not even being dissidents.

194
00:30:53.895 --> 00:30:55.766
These were the thought-makers.

195
00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:59.727
the opinion-makers
of Saudi society.

196
00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:01.642
Writers and intellectuals.

197
00:34:37.466 --> 00:34:39.642
For the first time.
we are now hearing

198
00:34:39.686 --> 00:34:42.819
from the fiancée of WashingtonPost reporter Jamal Khashoggi...

199
00:34:42.863 --> 00:34:44.125
...has called on U.S. lawmakers

200
00:34:44.169 --> 00:34:46.127
to hold
Saudi Arabia accountable.

201
00:34:46.171 --> 00:34:47.868
His fiancée says
she'll fight to ensure

202
00:34:47.911 --> 00:34:49.957
everyone who is responsible
for his death

203
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.002
is brought to justice.

204
00:35:05.929 --> 00:35:07.453
Yeah. I need 10 minutes.

205
00:35:07.496 --> 00:35:08.454
Yes.

206
00:35:11.283 --> 00:35:12.762
We need
to cross the opening...

207
00:35:12.806 --> 00:35:14.329
Absolutely. But let's go...

208
00:35:27.516 --> 00:35:30.519
If we can just announce
the press briefing.

209
00:35:30.563 --> 00:35:32.478
And is there any questions?

210
00:35:32.521 --> 00:35:34.306
If there's questions.
we cannot...

211
00:39:12.437 --> 00:39:14.439
I said.
"But here's the thing.

212
00:39:14.482 --> 00:39:16.832
Not every single one
of them trusts you."

213
00:39:18.878 --> 00:39:21.837
You are saying that
Jamal might be a spy.

214
00:39:26.189 --> 00:39:28.409
I met Jamal in Washington

215
00:39:28.453 --> 00:39:32.021
after a manor
connected me to him.

216
00:39:32.065 --> 00:39:34.459
I think we bonded a lot
over food. Heh.

217
00:39:34.502 --> 00:39:39.246
Like most. I guess.
Middle Easterners.

218
00:39:39.289 --> 00:39:41.988
He told me that
he had moved to the U.S.

219
00:39:42.031 --> 00:39:44.207
and that he was all alone

220
00:39:44.251 --> 00:39:45.687
and didn't know
what was happening

221
00:39:45.731 --> 00:39:48.864
for the first time
in his life at age 60.

222
00:39:48.908 --> 00:39:51.389
I remember
he started tearing up.

223
00:39:51.432 --> 00:39:57.003
telling me how his wife whom
he had loved very. very much.

224
00:39:57.046 --> 00:39:58.613
she wasn't okay with it.

225
00:39:58.657 --> 00:39:59.788
She-- Nobody was.

226
00:39:59.832 --> 00:40:01.094
His kids weren't okay with it.

227
00:40:01.137 --> 00:40:02.400
Nobody was okay with it.

228
00:40:03.618 --> 00:40:06.360
Everything was left behind

229
00:40:06.404 --> 00:40:10.669
and the country--
60 years of his life--

230
00:40:10.712 --> 00:40:12.018
everything.

231
00:40:12.061 --> 00:40:15.413
He struggled with it
every single day.

232
00:40:17.197 --> 00:40:21.027
In Saudi Arabia.
he was the biggest insider.

233
00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:23.072
And then. all of a sudden.
he finds himself

234
00:40:23.116 --> 00:40:24.378
on the outside.

235
00:40:24.422 --> 00:40:26.336
on the very much outside.

236
00:40:31.864 --> 00:40:34.257
I felt. like. for him
to settle emotionally.

237
00:40:34.301 --> 00:40:38.392
mentally. physically.
he needed to write again.

238
00:41:21.304 --> 00:41:23.219
I was a friend
of Jamal Khashoggi's

239
00:41:23.263 --> 00:41:25.483
for about 15 years.

240
00:41:25.526 --> 00:41:30.096
When he came toThe Washington
Post. he was transported.

241
00:41:30.139 --> 00:41:31.880
This was something
that he had dreamed about.

242
00:41:31.924 --> 00:41:33.360
You have to understand
what it's like

243
00:41:33.403 --> 00:41:34.579
to be a journalist
in Saudi Arabia.

244
00:41:34.622 --> 00:41:36.102
Every time
you try to say something

245
00:41:36.145 --> 00:41:38.408
that's tough-minded.
you get fired.

246
00:41:41.281 --> 00:41:44.937
He was the sort of person that just couldn't take a pass.

247
00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:48.418
If he felt something. he just insisted on writing it.

248
00:41:50.116 --> 00:41:51.465
I watched him get fired

249
00:41:51.509 --> 00:41:54.337
from a series of jobs
in Saudi Arabia.

250
00:41:54.381 --> 00:41:57.515
each time because
he just couldn't stop himself

251
00:41:57.558 --> 00:41:59.517
from saying
what he thought was true.

252
00:43:29.476 --> 00:43:31.434
All we want from you this time

253
00:43:31.478 --> 00:43:34.046
is to like and subscribe.

254
00:44:08.428 --> 00:44:11.649
We're seeing a truly historic
upheaval unfold right now.

255
00:44:11.692 --> 00:44:14.086
A royal purge in Saudi Arabia.

256
00:44:15.783 --> 00:44:17.306
King Salman
ordered the creation

257
00:44:17.350 --> 00:44:19.439
of a new
anti-corruption committee

258
00:44:19.482 --> 00:44:22.964
headed by son.
Prince Mohammed Salman.

259
00:44:23.008 --> 00:44:25.271
November of 2017.

260
00:44:25.314 --> 00:44:27.447
Mohammed Bin Salman
basically rounds up

261
00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:29.884
the most powerful people
in Saudi Arabia.

262
00:44:29.928 --> 00:44:32.539
puts them
in the Ritz in Riyadh.

263
00:44:32.582 --> 00:44:34.367
basically a five-star prison.

264
00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:37.283
and shakes them down
for a lot of money.

265
00:44:37.326 --> 00:44:39.285
over a $100 billion.

266
00:44:39.328 --> 00:44:41.896
Mohammed Bin Salman
ordered the arrest

267
00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:45.030
of powerful princes.
ministers. and investors.

268
00:44:45.073 --> 00:44:48.686
Some are his rivals
in the royal family.

269
00:45:02.787 --> 00:45:05.659
Is this also about
sending a message that.

270
00:45:05.703 --> 00:45:09.010
as we say in America.
there's a new sheriff in town?

271
00:45:38.823 --> 00:45:41.564
Jamal was starting
to realize that

272
00:45:41.608 --> 00:45:44.698
there's little
he can do for his country

273
00:45:44.742 --> 00:45:46.744
from his position
other than to write.

274
00:45:52.706 --> 00:45:54.882
Jamal Khashoggi
was kind of a black box

275
00:45:54.926 --> 00:45:57.493
of the ruling elites
in Saudi Arabia.

276
00:46:11.072 --> 00:46:14.423
It is easy to sit
and say we need.

277
00:46:14.467 --> 00:46:15.990
particularly in front
of American audience.

278
00:46:16.034 --> 00:46:17.383
we need more freedom.
we need more--

279
00:46:17.426 --> 00:46:18.601
these are golden things.

280
00:46:18.645 --> 00:46:19.951
Everybody loves them.

281
00:46:19.994 --> 00:46:21.039
--You have to be practical.

282
00:46:21.082 --> 00:46:22.649
I'm not asking
for democracy.

283
00:46:22.692 --> 00:46:25.217
I'm asking for people
to be allowed to speak.

284
00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:27.872
This is--
I'm asking for the minimum.

285
00:55:59.878 --> 00:56:02.228
In summer 2018.

286
00:56:02.271 --> 00:56:04.535
they were attacking him
basically every single day.

287
00:56:04.578 --> 00:56:07.364
threatening him.
trying to silence him.

288
00:56:09.714 --> 00:56:12.847
So Jamal felt the whole country was against him.

289
00:56:14.545 --> 00:56:16.111
And that was hurting him.

290
00:56:18.375 --> 00:56:19.985
He said. "Sometimes.
I feel a lot like

291
00:56:20.028 --> 00:56:21.813
"I don't wanna talk
about anything.

292
00:56:21.856 --> 00:56:23.858
I don't wanna expose
my opinions."

293
00:56:24.816 --> 00:56:26.426
I said. "No. no. no.

294
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:30.256
You're just a victim
of what we call the Flies."

295
00:56:34.826 --> 00:56:37.829
The government hired
thousands of people.

296
00:56:40.266 --> 00:56:43.530
Every one of them using
10. 20 accounts.

297
00:56:51.495 --> 00:56:54.498
The moment they think critic
of the government has posted.

298
00:56:54.541 --> 00:56:56.978
the flies swarmed.

299
00:56:57.022 --> 00:57:00.025
attacking with hundreds
of negative replies.

300
00:57:01.418 --> 00:57:03.463
Within minutes.
the tweet is covered

301
00:57:03.507 --> 00:57:06.466
in pro-government
comments and hashtags.

302
00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:09.208
causing the person's voice
to be lost.

303
00:57:11.645 --> 00:57:14.474
Then each fly posts
pro-government articles

304
00:57:14.518 --> 00:57:17.999
and hashtags.
supporting MBS's vision.

305
00:57:19.827 --> 00:57:24.397
And all of the fly can repost
thousands of those tweets...

306
00:57:25.616 --> 00:57:27.356
forcing the state's
false narrative

307
00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:29.663
to the top of trending
inside the country.

308
00:57:31.665 --> 00:57:33.624
This is
the whole Twitter monster

309
00:57:33.667 --> 00:57:36.757
that Saud al-Qahtani created

310
00:57:36.801 --> 00:57:39.325
and you have the troll master
himself on the top.

311
00:58:10.965 --> 00:58:14.360
I could get hundreds of
volunteers from Saudi Arabia.

312
00:58:14.403 --> 00:58:16.754
Kuwait. Yemen.
other countries.

313
00:58:18.364 --> 00:58:20.888
Each armed
with two. three phones.

314
00:58:20.932 --> 00:58:23.064
generating hundreds
of accounts.

315
00:58:24.762 --> 00:58:26.546
But first
we would have to make sure

316
00:58:26.590 --> 00:58:29.244
that they are protected.

317
00:58:29.288 --> 00:58:31.420
Anyone tweeting
inside Saudi Arabia

318
00:58:31.464 --> 00:58:33.510
will be immediately identified

319
00:58:33.553 --> 00:58:36.904
since the government
owns all this other networks.

320
00:58:38.558 --> 00:58:40.212
So to mask their identities.

321
00:58:40.255 --> 00:58:42.606
we must give them American
or Canadian safeguards.

322
00:58:46.784 --> 00:58:48.350
To battle The Flies.

323
00:58:48.394 --> 00:58:51.092
we will call ourselves
The Bees Army.

324
00:58:51.136 --> 00:58:53.181
We would organize
the volunteers

325
00:58:53.225 --> 00:58:55.227
into groups of 40 or 50 bees.

326
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:58.012
each reporting
to a supervising lieutenant.

327
00:58:59.927 --> 00:59:02.060
Once I give the command.
each lieutenant

328
00:59:02.103 --> 00:59:04.323
will tell their bee soldier
a specific tweet

329
00:59:04.366 --> 00:59:05.890
or hashtag to protect.

330
00:59:07.631 --> 00:59:10.242
But we're not going to use
the same method.

331
00:59:19.817 --> 00:59:21.383
Give them the freedom

332
00:59:21.427 --> 00:59:23.255
to say whatever they want.

333
00:59:26.214 --> 00:59:28.303
The Flies will.
of course. attack.

334
00:59:32.873 --> 00:59:34.962
But if our numbers
are stronger.

335
00:59:35.006 --> 00:59:37.922
we will be able to rise above
the propaganda machine...

336
00:59:39.663 --> 00:59:43.710
and finally install freedom
of speech inside the Kingdom.

337
00:59:46.234 --> 00:59:48.497
Jamal was really happy
of the idea.

338
00:59:48.541 --> 00:59:51.022
He said. "Brilliant. I really like it."

339
01:03:36.073 --> 01:03:39.728
Focusing all our efforts
on one hashtag.

340
01:03:39.772 --> 01:03:42.470
#wható_doóyouó_knowóabout
ó_the óbees?

341
01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:31.302
So the moment he left.

342
01:04:31.345 --> 01:04:33.695
they called
Saud al-Qahtani's office?

343
01:04:57.502 --> 01:05:00.070
And that was the turning point.

344
01:05:00.113 --> 01:05:02.550
It started trending.

345
01:05:42.025 --> 01:05:45.376
Jamal was surprised.
so then he started

346
01:05:45.419 --> 01:05:47.204
to tweet with us.
he tweeted it.

347
01:05:51.469 --> 01:05:53.514
And then we did it.

348
01:05:53.558 --> 01:05:56.082
Number one trending
in Saudi Arabia.

349
01:06:03.655 --> 01:06:05.962
And suddenly...

350
01:06:06.005 --> 01:06:07.572
he's not answering.

351
01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:13.970
He's just gone. disappeared.

352
01:07:04.716 --> 01:07:08.676
When I heard this.
I was driving to my house.

353
01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:11.766
My friends calling me
continuously.

354
01:07:11.810 --> 01:07:13.986
Come on. Jamal Khashoggi.

355
01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:15.553
It's news.

356
01:07:15.596 --> 01:07:19.252
I called a couple
of journalists based in Istanbul

357
01:07:19.296 --> 01:07:23.126
like Reuters.
Al Jazeera.Washington Post.

358
01:07:25.215 --> 01:07:28.044
There's really not a playbook
for this type of situation.

359
01:07:28.087 --> 01:07:30.263
but we did know that
we needed to act quickly.

360
01:07:30.307 --> 01:07:33.571
Within hours. we had
a letter dispatched
through the ambassador

361
01:07:33.614 --> 01:07:38.010
and through the United States government to the Crown Prince.

362
01:07:48.542 --> 01:07:51.328
I'd ask to meet with
the Saudi ambassador of the U.S.

363
01:07:51.371 --> 01:07:53.286
who happens to be the brother
of the Crown Prince.

364
01:07:53.330 --> 01:07:56.376
First response was that
he was looking into the matter.

365
01:08:40.812 --> 01:08:44.946
First day. there was
10 or 12 journalists

366
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:46.296
waiting outside.

367
01:08:46.339 --> 01:08:48.254
The day after. hundreds.

368
01:08:50.169 --> 01:08:51.692
He entered this embassy...

369
01:08:51.736 --> 01:08:55.000
Two days later. 200.

370
01:08:55.043 --> 01:08:57.785
We demand his immediate release
if alive.

371
01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:54.364
I am concerned about it.

372
01:09:54.407 --> 01:09:55.930
I don't like hearing about it.

373
01:09:55.974 --> 01:09:58.890
And hopefully.
that will sort itself out.

374
01:09:58.933 --> 01:10:01.414
Right now. nobody knows
anything about it.

375
01:10:01.458 --> 01:10:03.895
but there's somepretty bad stories going around.

376
01:10:03.938 --> 01:10:06.158
I do not like it.
Thank you. I'll see you.

377
01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:08.029
I'll see you at 10:00.

378
01:10:28.398 --> 01:10:30.226
I will not let you down

379
01:10:30.269 --> 01:10:34.230
and I will not stop
defending you.

380
01:10:34.273 --> 01:10:35.883
Always be well.

381
01:11:14.226 --> 01:11:16.489
To breaking news now.
we are getting reports

382
01:11:16.533 --> 01:11:18.317
that Turkish authorities
believe that

383
01:11:18.361 --> 01:11:19.536
prominent Saudi journalist

384
01:11:19.579 --> 01:11:21.364
Jamal Khashoggi
has been killed.

385
01:11:21.407 --> 01:11:23.191
-Jamal Khashoggi--
-Jamal Khashoggi--

386
01:11:25.846 --> 01:11:27.544
We heard
one lie after another

387
01:11:27.587 --> 01:11:29.459
from the Saudi government.

388
01:11:29.502 --> 01:11:31.591
Saudi Arabia has denied angrily

389
01:11:31.635 --> 01:11:34.028
that it abducted. harmed.
or killed Khashoggi.

390
01:11:34.072 --> 01:11:36.030
Now suddenly.
the country is admitting

391
01:11:36.074 --> 01:11:38.642
that Khashoggi did die
inside that building.

392
01:11:38.685 --> 01:11:42.341
We heard that
he suffocated accidentally.

393
01:11:42.385 --> 01:11:44.256
We heard that there was
a drug administered

394
01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:45.866
that had an unintended effect.

395
01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:48.913
The government now says
he died in a fist fight.

396
01:12:05.886 --> 01:12:09.455
A Saudi agent was captured
on surveillance cameras

397
01:12:09.499 --> 01:12:13.546
in Istanbul
wearing Khashoggi's clothes.

398
01:12:50.888 --> 01:12:53.020
The Washington Post
has just posted

399
01:12:53.064 --> 01:12:55.893
the last piece
Jamal Khashoggi wrote.

400
01:12:55.936 --> 01:12:57.895
filed shortly
before he was seen

401
01:12:57.938 --> 01:13:01.507
entering that Saudi consulate
in Turkey.

402
01:13:01.551 --> 01:13:04.380
Tonight. there are still
many unanswered questions

403
01:13:04.423 --> 01:13:05.729
in his disappearance.

404
01:13:05.772 --> 01:13:07.905
Earlier today.
Turkish investigators

405
01:13:07.948 --> 01:13:09.602
search the residence of...

406
01:13:40.981 --> 01:13:42.505
This one.

407
01:17:44.050 --> 01:17:47.010
The court
has issued arrest warrants

408
01:17:47.053 --> 01:17:48.838
for two additional suspects

409
01:17:48.881 --> 01:17:50.927
in the killing
of Jamal Khashoggi.

410
01:17:50.970 --> 01:17:54.757
Ahmed al-Asiri
was the country's
Deputy Intelligence Chief

411
01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:58.630
and high-ranking adviser
to the Crown Prince.

412
01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:01.851
Saud al-Qahtani
was a Royal Court Adviser

413
01:18:01.894 --> 01:18:04.810
and key counselor to Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

414
01:18:39.366 --> 01:18:41.412
The chief prosecutor
who's been holding

415
01:18:41.455 --> 01:18:44.763
a joint investigation with his Saudi counterpart this week

416
01:18:44.807 --> 01:18:47.200
issued a statement
following their talks.

417
01:18:47.244 --> 01:18:50.638
He says discussions yielded
no concrete results.

418
01:18:50.682 --> 01:18:55.643
despite Turkey's intentions
to reveal the truth.

419
01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:08.918
Sir. can you say anything
from the investigation?

420
01:19:08.961 --> 01:19:10.963
Where is Khashoggi's body?

421
01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:56.661
My name is John Scott-Railton.

422
01:19:56.704 --> 01:19:59.795
I'm a senior researcher
at a place called
The Citizen Lab.

423
01:20:02.885 --> 01:20:06.976
It's this group of
researchers and investigators

424
01:20:07.019 --> 01:20:08.629
that try to understand

425
01:20:08.673 --> 01:20:09.805
the digital things

426
01:20:09.848 --> 01:20:12.068
that are targeting
civil society.

427
01:20:12.111 --> 01:20:16.028
so journalists.
activists. everybody really.

428
01:20:16.072 --> 01:20:19.902
who's part of what constitutes
a flourishing democracy.

429
01:20:23.079 --> 01:20:26.299
It's almost a miracle
that we found Omar.

430
01:20:26.343 --> 01:20:27.953
It's a miracle that
he survived this long.

431
01:20:30.521 --> 01:20:34.394
There's sort of a growing
global market for spyware.

432
01:20:34.438 --> 01:20:37.484
Governments want to listen
to encrypted phone calls.

433
01:20:37.528 --> 01:20:39.095
They wanna read
your WhatsApp chats.

434
01:20:39.138 --> 01:20:41.575
your Signal chats.
and they can't do it

435
01:20:41.619 --> 01:20:43.490
as that chat
goes across their network.

436
01:20:43.534 --> 01:20:46.058
So. their solution to this is.
let's hack the phone.

437
01:20:46.102 --> 01:20:48.713
Was the CIA aware

438
01:20:48.756 --> 01:20:51.672
that the Saudis had purchased
spyware from Israel?

439
01:20:51.716 --> 01:20:53.544
I'm not going
to confirm or deny.

440
01:20:53.587 --> 01:20:55.981
That's either--
We're aware of certain things.

441
01:20:56.025 --> 01:20:58.984
All's I will say is that
the Saudi services

442
01:20:59.028 --> 01:21:01.944
are able to have insight
into what their citizens

443
01:21:01.987 --> 01:21:05.425
or what even non-Saudi citizens
were doing

444
01:21:05.469 --> 01:21:06.862
inside the Kingdom
and outside.

445
01:21:08.646 --> 01:21:10.387
Saudi Arabia is definitely

446
01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:12.955
a major player in the space.

447
01:21:12.998 --> 01:21:16.567
Throughout my entire career.
I focused on the top four--

448
01:21:16.610 --> 01:21:19.875
Russia. China.
Iran. North Korea.

449
01:21:19.918 --> 01:21:21.833
And I think it's safe to say
that Saudi Arabia

450
01:21:21.877 --> 01:21:24.618
has comparable skills
and abilities

451
01:21:24.662 --> 01:21:27.752
to conduct cyber operations.

452
01:21:27.795 --> 01:21:29.536
I think it's important
for people to understand

453
01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:32.496
how easy it is
to access these tools.

454
01:21:38.371 --> 01:21:42.071
Thanks to an Israeli company called NSO.

455
01:21:42.114 --> 01:21:45.639
the Saudis have
the best hacking technology

456
01:21:45.683 --> 01:21:47.119
that money can buy.

457
01:21:48.686 --> 01:21:50.688
Pegasus Version Two.

458
01:21:54.648 --> 01:21:57.521
Pegasus is a piece of software.

459
01:21:57.564 --> 01:21:59.871
but it's also a capability.

460
01:21:59.915 --> 01:22:02.656
it's the capability
to infect a phone

461
01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:05.007
and turn it into a digital spy

462
01:22:05.050 --> 01:22:07.357
in the pocket of the victim--

463
01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:10.969
siphoning off private
and encrypted chats.

464
01:22:11.013 --> 01:22:12.840
photographs. messages.

465
01:22:12.884 --> 01:22:15.452
even enabling the microphone
and the camera.

466
01:22:15.495 --> 01:22:18.150
turn that phone
into a bug in a room.

467
01:22:19.891 --> 01:22:21.849
They sent a malicious link.

468
01:22:21.893 --> 01:22:24.026
The link looks legit. you know. it looks like. for example.

469
01:22:24.069 --> 01:22:26.028
you know. boarding pass.

470
01:22:26.071 --> 01:22:29.770
you click on it and it actually goes where it's supposed to go.

471
01:22:29.814 --> 01:22:31.598
but in between.
it's downloading something

472
01:22:31.642 --> 01:22:33.731
into your device.

473
01:22:33.774 --> 01:22:36.560
Once it compromises
mobile devices.

474
01:22:36.603 --> 01:22:38.431
the end user
of the Pegasus tool

475
01:22:38.475 --> 01:22:41.391
has unfettered access
to that device.

476
01:22:44.046 --> 01:22:47.963
Think of your phone today.
the people you talk to.

477
01:22:48.006 --> 01:22:50.748
the photos you take.
the places you go.

478
01:22:50.791 --> 01:22:53.577
the things that you say around and into your phone. right?

479
01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:56.797
This is a huge slice
of your life.

480
01:22:56.841 --> 01:22:59.800
And that stuff
is tremendously valuable

481
01:22:59.844 --> 01:23:01.933
to somebody who wants
to monitor you.

482
01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:03.195
who wants to figure out
what you're doing

483
01:23:03.239 --> 01:23:04.631
and maybe who wants to subvert

484
01:23:04.675 --> 01:23:07.286
your political activity.

485
01:23:07.330 --> 01:23:11.421
Once Pegasus takes control
of a phone. it's game over.

486
01:23:30.048 --> 01:23:32.703
To share information. an infected device

487
01:23:32.746 --> 01:23:36.576
is gonna be talking to
the servers that control it.

488
01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:39.492
It has to phone home.

489
01:23:39.536 --> 01:23:42.104
And so we had developed
a technique

490
01:23:42.147 --> 01:23:46.630
to see what networks
might have infected devices.

491
01:23:47.979 --> 01:23:49.285
So. what we found in Montreal

492
01:23:49.328 --> 01:23:50.895
in December 2018

493
01:23:50.938 --> 01:23:53.289
is that there appeared
to be a device

494
01:23:53.332 --> 01:23:55.465
in the University Network
phoning home

495
01:23:55.508 --> 01:23:57.771
to a cluster of servers
that belonged

496
01:23:57.815 --> 01:24:00.339
to Saudi Arabia's
Pegasus deployment.

497
01:24:34.069 --> 01:24:36.897
So. we go to Montreal. we sit with Omar

498
01:24:36.941 --> 01:24:41.032
and actually find
the message on Omar's phone

499
01:24:41.076 --> 01:24:43.426
that we believe led
to that infection.

500
01:24:43.469 --> 01:24:46.646
It looks like a DHL
shipping tracking notification.

501
01:24:46.690 --> 01:24:48.561
Only it isn't.

502
01:28:58.245 --> 01:29:01.597
Are you being allowed in?
Are the Saudis allowing you in?

503
01:29:18.527 --> 01:29:21.138
Some of the tape
recordings we've heard

504
01:29:21.181 --> 01:29:22.835
preceded the killing.

505
01:29:41.071 --> 01:29:42.768
"Joints will be separated.

506
01:29:42.812 --> 01:29:44.640
"It's not a problem.

507
01:30:56.973 --> 01:30:59.497
The conversation turns to.

508
01:30:59.541 --> 01:31:02.457
"Will you come back
to Saudi Arabia?"

509
01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:44.455
The fear is escalating
in his voice.

510
01:31:54.596 --> 01:31:56.685
Then we hear a struggle.

511
01:32:34.723 --> 01:32:36.812
You can hear the other people

512
01:33:05.405 --> 01:33:10.193
The most difficult part
of those recordings

513
01:33:44.706 --> 01:33:48.231
I was thinking. when
he entered his consulate...

514
01:35:14.099 --> 01:35:16.754
The king firmly denied
any knowledge of it.

515
01:35:16.798 --> 01:35:18.669
I don't wanna get
into his mind.

516
01:35:18.713 --> 01:35:20.540
But it sounded to me like

517
01:35:20.584 --> 01:35:24.283
maybe these could have been
rogue killers. Who knows?

518
01:35:27.243 --> 01:35:29.462
World leaders are
gathering in Saudi Arabia

519
01:35:29.506 --> 01:35:32.683
for a summit commonly known
as "Davos in the desert."

520
01:35:32.727 --> 01:35:34.772
A couple weeks
after the murder.

521
01:35:34.816 --> 01:35:37.732
there was a big. important
conference for Saudi Arabia.

522
01:35:37.775 --> 01:35:41.605
Davos in the desert is supposed to promote Saudi Crown Prince.

523
01:35:41.648 --> 01:35:45.217
Mohammed bin Salman's reform vision for the Kingdom.

524
01:35:45.261 --> 01:35:48.525
Davos in the desert is the make or break part of Vision 2030.

525
01:35:50.135 --> 01:35:53.748
But it ended up being
a fiasco for MBS.

526
01:35:59.492 --> 01:36:03.496
The Jamal story

527
01:36:03.540 --> 01:36:05.542
galvanized public attention

528
01:36:05.585 --> 01:36:08.153
in the United States.
around the world.

529
01:36:11.766 --> 01:36:16.205
It may destroy MBS' hopes
for modernizing the Kingdom

530
01:36:16.248 --> 01:36:18.163
because he needs investors.

531
01:36:18.207 --> 01:36:20.470
he needs people who invest
in the Kingdom.

532
01:36:20.513 --> 01:36:23.560
And right now.
he has become toxic.

533
01:36:25.605 --> 01:36:27.607
As pressure on Saudi mounts.

534
01:36:27.651 --> 01:36:30.785
several U.S. media organizationsand business leaders

535
01:36:30.828 --> 01:36:34.745
have pulled out of
a major investment
conference in Riyadh.

536
01:36:34.789 --> 01:36:36.312
The conference happens.

537
01:36:36.355 --> 01:36:39.054
all those important guests
eventually don't go.

538
01:36:39.097 --> 01:36:43.623
Jeff Bezos was supposed
to be a secret guest.

539
01:36:43.667 --> 01:36:47.453
Bezos is someone with a direct relationship with MBS.

540
01:36:47.497 --> 01:36:50.543
They messaged each other.

541
01:36:50.587 --> 01:36:52.328
They talked about business.
They talked about. you know.

542
01:36:52.371 --> 01:36:55.374
all the great things
they're gonna do together.

543
01:36:55.418 --> 01:36:56.767
And he was supposed to declare

544
01:36:56.811 --> 01:37:00.727
this enormous deal
at this conference.

545
01:37:00.771 --> 01:37:02.164
But after the murder.

546
01:37:02.207 --> 01:37:06.168
Bezos just stopped
all contact with MBS.

547
01:37:06.211 --> 01:37:07.734
Bezos owns
The Washington Post.

548
01:37:07.778 --> 01:37:10.563
which means that
Jamal worked for him.

549
01:37:10.607 --> 01:37:15.090
It seemed that MBS expected
Bezos to say. "You know what?

550
01:37:15.133 --> 01:37:16.656
"I control this newspaper

551
01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:18.310
and I can curb them.
I can tell them.

552
01:37:18.354 --> 01:37:20.225
you know. don't make
a big deal about this."

553
01:37:20.269 --> 01:37:23.315
But when push came to shove.
Bezos did not interfere

554
01:37:23.359 --> 01:37:26.710
whenThe Washington Post
started a whole campaign.

555
01:37:26.753 --> 01:37:28.625
"Justice for Jamal".

556
01:37:30.061 --> 01:37:32.759
MBS saw that as betrayal.

557
01:37:34.152 --> 01:37:36.676
After Davos in the desert.

558
01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:38.069
we have evidence

559
01:37:38.113 --> 01:37:39.941
that Jeff Bezos' phone

560
01:37:39.984 --> 01:37:43.945
had been infected
with malware.

561
01:37:43.988 --> 01:37:47.600
And the way in which
that technology was delivered

562
01:37:47.644 --> 01:37:49.341
to his phone was through a text

563
01:37:49.385 --> 01:37:52.649
from the Crown Prince himself.

564
01:37:54.303 --> 01:37:56.696
I am the United Nations
Special Rapporteur

565
01:37:56.740 --> 01:37:59.351
on Freedom of Opinion
and Expression.

566
01:37:59.395 --> 01:38:03.268
The work that I've been doing
over the last 18 months or so

567
01:38:03.312 --> 01:38:05.618
is on the private
surveillance industry.

568
01:38:10.797 --> 01:38:13.757
A video was sent in 2018

569
01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:15.759
from MBS' WhatsApp account

570
01:38:15.802 --> 01:38:17.543
to Jeff Bezos' phone.

571
01:38:18.893 --> 01:38:21.721
Then we see
this massive increase

572
01:38:21.765 --> 01:38:25.334
in data leaving the phone.

573
01:38:25.377 --> 01:38:27.031
It was only after

574
01:38:27.075 --> 01:38:28.946
the killing of Jamal Khashoggi

575
01:38:28.990 --> 01:38:31.775
thatThe Washington Post
was an important target

576
01:38:31.818 --> 01:38:34.169
for Saudi Arabia.

577
01:38:34.212 --> 01:38:38.303
This was exactly the moment
whenThe National Enquirer

578
01:38:38.347 --> 01:38:40.523
was saying to Bezos.

579
01:38:40.566 --> 01:38:44.440
"We have evidence
connecting you to an affair."

580
01:38:45.745 --> 01:38:49.271
So Bezos' security team
is learning

581
01:38:49.314 --> 01:38:51.403
that his phone
may have been compromised.

582
01:38:51.447 --> 01:38:53.057
But at the same time.

583
01:38:53.101 --> 01:38:56.017
Bezos is getting
WhatsApp messages

584
01:38:56.060 --> 01:38:57.932
from MBS that are strange.

585
01:38:59.716 --> 01:39:01.761
Essentially.
"Whatever you're hearing

586
01:39:01.805 --> 01:39:05.461
about Saudi involvement
in this is not true."

587
01:39:05.504 --> 01:39:08.420
In order to send
those kinds of text messages.

588
01:39:08.464 --> 01:39:09.944
MBS has to know

589
01:39:09.987 --> 01:39:13.164
what Bezos is learning
about Saudi involvement.

590
01:39:14.949 --> 01:39:16.515
And then what we see is that

591
01:39:16.559 --> 01:39:19.475
there's this massive
Saudi online campaign.

592
01:39:19.518 --> 01:39:20.737
a Twitter campaign.

593
01:39:20.780 --> 01:39:22.652
against Jeff Bezos.

594
01:39:24.219 --> 01:39:25.698
The intention
was to humiliate

595
01:39:25.742 --> 01:39:28.005
and to punish Bezos.

596
01:39:28.049 --> 01:39:31.878
It was exactly the same thing
that they did to Jamal.

597
01:39:34.577 --> 01:39:37.362
That mere fact that
MBS has the reach

598
01:39:37.406 --> 01:39:41.584
to conduct surveillance on the richest man in the world

599
01:39:41.627 --> 01:39:44.021
is not only striking.
but it's scary.

600
01:39:46.893 --> 01:39:49.809
Earlier today. CIA Director.
Gina Haspel briefed

601
01:39:49.853 --> 01:39:52.638
a select group of high ranking senators on the killing

602
01:39:52.682 --> 01:39:55.467
ofWashington Post columnist.
Jamal Khashoggi.

603
01:39:55.511 --> 01:39:58.514
The CIA Director. Gina Haspel met with the Turks

604
01:39:58.557 --> 01:40:02.083
and said. "Show me the audio.
Let me hear it."

605
01:40:03.649 --> 01:40:06.435
The CIA Director's job is to present the information

606
01:40:06.478 --> 01:40:10.091
to a policymaker so they can
make a decision on how to act.

607
01:40:10.134 --> 01:40:11.918
This assessment was different.

608
01:40:11.962 --> 01:40:15.183
If the Crown Prince
went in front of a jury.

609
01:40:15.226 --> 01:40:17.576
he would be convicted
in 30 minutes.

610
01:40:17.620 --> 01:40:19.404
Yes.

611
01:40:19.448 --> 01:40:22.103
They're buying hundreds
of billions of dollars' worth

612
01:40:22.146 --> 01:40:23.843
of things from this country.

613
01:40:23.887 --> 01:40:26.542
I'm not gonna destroy
the economy for our country

614
01:40:26.585 --> 01:40:29.066
by being foolish
with Saudi Arabia. so...

615
01:40:29.110 --> 01:40:31.851
There's not a smoking gun.
there's a smoking saw.

616
01:40:31.895 --> 01:40:33.462
You have to be willfully blind

617
01:40:33.505 --> 01:40:36.856
not to come to the conclusionthat this was orchestrated

618
01:40:36.900 --> 01:40:42.079
and organized by people in--
under the command of MBS.

619
01:40:42.123 --> 01:40:43.472
Did MBS lie to you. sir?

620
01:40:43.515 --> 01:40:45.561
He told me thathe had nothing to do with it.

621
01:40:45.604 --> 01:40:48.085
-But what if he's lying?-As recently as a few days ago.

622
01:40:48.129 --> 01:40:50.740
Did you just live with it
because you need him?

623
01:40:50.783 --> 01:40:52.959
Well. will anybody
really know. all right?

624
01:40:53.003 --> 01:40:54.352
Will anybody really know?

625
01:40:54.396 --> 01:40:55.832
I have not seen.

626
01:40:55.875 --> 01:40:58.182
in 20 years
covering intelligence.

627
01:40:58.226 --> 01:41:02.186
the conclusion from the CIA
that is this confident

628
01:41:02.230 --> 01:41:05.276
about the role
of one person in an act.

629
01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:07.496
Everybody
but the President agrees

630
01:41:07.539 --> 01:41:09.063
that Mohammed bin Salman
ordered

631
01:41:09.106 --> 01:41:11.021
Jamal Khashoggi's
assassination.

632
01:42:39.892 --> 01:42:42.808
Nine. eight. seven...

633
01:43:06.136 --> 01:43:08.182
The first day they broadcast.

634
01:43:08.225 --> 01:43:12.447
Jamal invites Shiite dissidents on the air.

635
01:43:12.490 --> 01:43:16.277
who were the people
who the Bahrainian
authorities most feared.

636
01:45:16.397 --> 01:45:17.702
Are we so blind

637
01:45:17.746 --> 01:45:20.052
to the malign influence
of Saudi Arabia

638
01:45:20.096 --> 01:45:21.924
that we just give
money and weapons

639
01:45:21.967 --> 01:45:24.840
to anybody regardless
of what they do?

640
01:45:24.883 --> 01:45:28.365
You can cut a dissident
into pieces with a bone saw

641
01:45:28.409 --> 01:45:30.498
and we'll
still give you weapons?

642
01:47:25.874 --> 01:47:27.092
Thank you.

643
01:47:27.136 --> 01:47:29.530
I now give the floor
to Saudi Arabia.

644
01:47:32.097 --> 01:47:33.359
Thank you.

645
01:47:33.403 --> 01:47:35.361
Accusations have been launched

646
01:47:35.405 --> 01:47:38.147
and fingers have been pointed.

647
01:47:38.190 --> 01:47:42.760
we reject any attempt
to remove this

648
01:47:42.804 --> 01:47:45.459
from our national justice
system in Saudi Arabia

649
01:47:45.502 --> 01:47:47.330
in respect to the form
that that may take.

650
01:47:47.373 --> 01:47:48.810
Many thanks.

651
01:48:11.833 --> 01:48:14.575
Did you order
the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?

652
01:48:15.924 --> 01:48:17.839
Absolutely not.

653
01:48:17.882 --> 01:48:19.623
Some think that I should know

654
01:48:19.667 --> 01:48:21.146
what three million
people working

655
01:48:21.190 --> 01:48:23.714
for the Saudi government
do daily?

656
01:48:23.758 --> 01:48:25.455
Absolutely not.

657
01:48:29.415 --> 01:48:32.331
My name is Hatice Cengiz.

658
01:48:32.375 --> 01:48:34.943
I'm addressing you
as a victim.

659
01:48:34.986 --> 01:48:39.730
a title forced on me after
the brutal murder of my Jamal.

660
01:48:42.211 --> 01:48:47.216
Jamal and I would have been
husband and wife by now.

661
01:48:51.437 --> 01:48:55.964
The failure to punish Jamal's
murderers affects us all.

662
01:48:57.618 --> 01:49:02.231
But also democracy.
human rights. and freedom.

663
01:49:04.494 --> 01:49:09.238
Mr. Chair.
the truth always wins.

664
01:49:09.281 --> 01:49:11.588
History will take note.

665
01:49:11.632 --> 01:49:14.678
Please take action.
Thank you.

666
01:52:16.251 --> 01:52:19.036
Hatice. you paced that street

667
01:52:19.080 --> 01:52:21.822
and waiting for hours.

668
01:52:21.865 --> 01:52:26.391
No one should ever have
to endure what you did.

669
01:52:26.435 --> 01:52:28.350
We are here

670
01:52:28.393 --> 01:52:30.004
and you are not alone.
