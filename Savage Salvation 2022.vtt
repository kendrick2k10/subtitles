00:21:29.658 --> 00:21:30.663
Baby. if you let me just--

189
00:21:30.765 --> 00:21:31.759
Do you love me?

190
00:21:31.861 --> 00:21:34.194
Baby. I love you. Just try to
stay in.

191
00:21:34.296 --> 00:21:35.667
I understand.

192
00:21:36.697 --> 00:21:38.296
I am in so much--

193
00:21:48.882 --> 00:21:50.977
Hey. hey.

194
00:22:03.424 --> 00:22:04.059
It's okay.

195
00:22:18.706 --> 00:22:20.406
It's alright. We'll be okay.

196
00:22:48.239 --> 00:22:49.508
Hey. how you doing?

197
00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:58.649
Can I see this one?

198
00:23:15.166 --> 00:23:16.361
She real?

199
00:23:16.464 --> 00:23:17.767
Yes. sir.

200
00:23:20.305 --> 00:23:21.705
Ain't stolen. is she?

201
00:23:23.441 --> 00:23:24.540
You looking for a stolen ring.

202
00:23:24.642 --> 00:23:25.338
you're in the wrong goddamn
shop. boy.

203
00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.611
No.

204
00:23:33.052 --> 00:23:34.817
I have 450.

205
00:23:36.591 --> 00:23:40.790
I might be willing to bend a
little. but not much.

206
00:23:44.363 --> 00:23:46.059
And don't ask me for no layaway.

207
00:23:47.132 --> 00:23:48.230
Okay. then

208
00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.751
I'll be back for it when I got
the money.

209
00:24:08.818 --> 00:24:10.284
Can't promise you it'll still be
here.

210
00:24:10.386 --> 00:24:11.623
She'll be here.

211
00:24:14.256 --> 00:24:15.354
Oh!

212
00:24:15.456 --> 00:24:16.727
Oh fuck.

213
00:24:17.658 --> 00:24:19.257
Where you been. cuz?

214
00:24:20.364 --> 00:24:21.760
I'm in hurry. Elvis.

215
00:24:21.862 --> 00:24:23.703
Cash flow issues?

216
00:24:23.805 --> 00:24:24.630
What?

217
00:24:24.732 --> 00:24:27.132
Why didn't you say so?

218
00:24:27.234 --> 00:24:29.234
Just enough to tie you and your
little lady over.

219
00:24:33.278 --> 00:24:34.445
Fuck. fuck. no man.

220
00:24:34.547 --> 00:24:36.676
No. I don't want that fucking
shit.

221
00:24:36.778 --> 00:24:38.851
Me and Ruby. we're clean now.

222
00:24:38.953 --> 00:24:39.917
That a fact?

223
00:24:40.019 --> 00:24:41.353
Yeah.

224
00:24:41.455 --> 00:24:43.117
I'm gonna ask Ruby about that by
myself.

225
00:24:43.219 --> 00:24:44.153
No.

226
00:24:44.255 --> 00:24:45.356
No. you don't.

227
00:24:45.458 --> 00:24:46.884
I need you to stay away from
her.

228
00:24:46.986 --> 00:24:49.053
All those times I fronted you.

229
00:24:49.155 --> 00:24:50.758
Now you act like I'm some shit

230
00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:52.532
you can just scrape off your
boot?

231
00:24:59.072 --> 00:25:00.133
85 bucks.

232
00:25:01.305 --> 00:25:02.266
It's all I got.

233
00:25:02.368 --> 00:25:04.841
For you to stay the fuck away
from me and Ruby.

234
00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:24.397
She ain't get by me.

235
00:25:24.499 --> 00:25:26.126
That's why I get paid the big
bucks for.

236
00:25:28.035 --> 00:25:28.759
You know what?

237
00:25:28.861 --> 00:25:29.629
What?

238
00:25:29.731 --> 00:25:30.462
No. don't...

239
00:25:37.407 --> 00:25:38.406
See?

240
00:25:58.662 --> 00:26:00.325
Swear to god. I got worried.

241
00:26:01.731 --> 00:26:02.731
Now you got nothing better to do

242
00:26:02.833 --> 00:26:03.999
than sit around
and worry about me?

243
00:26:10.271 --> 00:26:15.079
I know how hard it must be
working all day for us

244
00:26:15.181 --> 00:26:15.775
like you do.

245
00:26:15.877 --> 00:26:17.848
But it's gonna be worth it.

246
00:26:19.813 --> 00:26:21.313
I just saw Elvis.

247
00:26:24.786 --> 00:26:26.153
Did you take something?

248
00:26:27.757 --> 00:26:29.354
Is that what you think of me?

249
00:26:29.456 --> 00:26:31.628
You're the one who just came in
here acting all weird

250
00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:32.591
telling me that you saw Elvis
when--

251
00:26:32.693 --> 00:26:33.897
Well. I didn't.

252
00:26:35.069 --> 00:26:35.998
This time.

253
00:26:37.136 --> 00:26:37.962
Fuck.

254
00:26:38.064 --> 00:26:40.103
I'm sorry. what are you saying?

255
00:26:40.205 --> 00:26:41.366
I just--

256
00:26:43.641 --> 00:26:45.109
I don't think I can do this.

257
00:26:45.211 --> 00:26:46.640
I can't do this.

258
00:26:46.742 --> 00:26:48.010
I can't fucking do this.

259
00:26:49.116 --> 00:26:50.276
I feel it.

260
00:26:51.814 --> 00:26:52.814
What are you saying?

261
00:26:52.916 --> 00:26:53.984
You shouldn't be around me
right now.

262
00:26:54.086 --> 00:26:54.946
I--

263
00:26:55.048 --> 00:26:56.354
Fuck. I gotta get out of here.

264
00:26:56.457 --> 00:26:57.748
What? Hey! It's just--

265
00:26:57.850 --> 00:26:59.388
Hey!

266
00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:01.089
Don't you say that.

267
00:27:03.196 --> 00:27:03.961
It's okay.

268
00:27:04.063 --> 00:27:05.291
Hey.

269
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.999
We're doing this.

270
00:27:11.434 --> 00:27:12.100
Okay?

271
00:27:15.871 --> 00:27:17.677
I don't want to fuck this up.

272
00:27:18.739 --> 00:27:20.178
You hearing me?

273
00:27:40.126 --> 00:27:44.603
Oh. just the man I need to see.

274
00:27:44.705 --> 00:27:47.636
Goddamn pothole playing hell.
am I right?

275
00:27:47.738 --> 00:27:49.739
Where are my tax dollars going?

276
00:27:49.841 --> 00:27:52.041
You paying taxes these days.
Elvis?

277
00:27:55.114 --> 00:27:57.710
You ain't got a side hustle for
fares. do you now?

278
00:27:57.812 --> 00:27:58.746
I'm Sheriff Church.

279
00:27:58.848 --> 00:28:00.216
Get your hands off my vehicle.

280
00:28:01.552 --> 00:28:04.350
Hey. no disrespect.

281
00:28:35.849 --> 00:28:37.815
Oh. shit!

282
00:28:38.686 --> 00:28:39.756
Fuck!

283
00:28:39.858 --> 00:28:42.157
Goddammit. you gave me
a heart attack.

284
00:28:43.327 --> 00:28:44.360
Huh?

285
00:28:45.329 --> 00:28:46.799
Hah!

286
00:28:48.202 --> 00:28:49.298
Guess what?

287
00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.060
What?

288
00:28:50.162 --> 00:28:52.370
The thrift shop hired me.

289
00:28:52.472 --> 00:28:53.238
Well. of course. they did.

290
00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:54.166
What'd I tell you?

291
00:28:54.268 --> 00:28:55.132
Yeah. well. it's only part time
for now.

292
00:28:55.234 --> 00:28:57.837
But they have the cutest stuff.

293
00:28:57.939 --> 00:29:01.275
And I got you a present.

294
00:29:07.452 --> 00:29:09.751
Oh. you hate it.

295
00:29:09.853 --> 00:29:10.617
No. No. no. I don't hate it.

296
00:29:10.719 --> 00:29:11.651
You hate it.

297
00:29:11.753 --> 00:29:13.791
Yes. you do.

298
00:29:13.893 --> 00:29:16.857
Gee. I don't think I've worn a
button-up

299
00:29:16.959 --> 00:29:18.556
since my fucking graduation.

300
00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:22.463
I like this one better.

301
00:29:22.565 --> 00:29:24.136
Yeah?

302
00:29:24.238 --> 00:29:25.365
You like it?

303
00:29:26.803 --> 00:29:28.701
Yeah. I like it a lot.

304
00:29:28.803 --> 00:29:30.106
Hey. thank you.

305
00:29:31.542 --> 00:29:32.938
You're welcome.

306
00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.211
I mean it. thank you.

307
00:29:36.209 --> 00:29:37.916
Well. I mean it. you're welcome.

308
00:29:39.286 --> 00:29:40.085
Guess what?

309
00:29:40.187 --> 00:29:40.715
What?

310
00:29:40.817 --> 00:29:41.848
Got you a present. too.

311
00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:43.155
-No. you didn't.
-I did.

312
00:29:43.257 --> 00:29:43.884
No. you didn't.

313
00:29:43.986 --> 00:29:44.551
I gotta take you to it though.

314
00:29:44.654 --> 00:29:45.356
No. you--

315
00:29:45.458 --> 00:29:46.559
Yes. I do.

316
00:29:46.661 --> 00:29:48.592
Oh. I gotta take you to the
present.

317
00:29:48.694 --> 00:29:50.591
It's all the way in the bedroom.

318
00:29:50.693 --> 00:29:51.957
I'm so sorry.

319
00:29:52.059 --> 00:29:52.890
I did. oh my goodness.

320
00:29:55.997 --> 00:29:57.434
You are so...

321
00:30:16.182 --> 00:30:18.754
Hey. I love you. Ruby Red.

322
00:30:18.856 --> 00:30:20.926
I love you more. Shelby John.

323
00:30:47.013 --> 00:30:48.519
Shelby. Ms. Red.

324
00:30:48.621 --> 00:30:49.949
Hey. Mike. how's it going?

325
00:30:50.051 --> 00:30:51.590
Goes right. I suppose.

326
00:30:51.692 --> 00:30:53.789
Like the whirl or like the
toilet?

327
00:30:53.891 --> 00:30:55.620
There is a perspective of it.

328
00:30:56.727 --> 00:30:57.888
It's like the whirl!

329
00:31:03.029 --> 00:31:08.039
Well. I have to admit. it's nice
to see your friends happy.

330
00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:11.710
We made it.

331
00:31:16.515 --> 00:31:17.983
Ruby Red.

332
00:31:19.353 --> 00:31:20.920
Hey. Peter.

00:31:38.639 --> 00:31:40.669

Oh my God. Conor.

You're getting so big.

347
00:31:48.846 --> 00:31:50.274
You better stop growing.

348
00:31:50.376 --> 00:31:52.484

Thanks.

352
00:31:56.754 --> 00:31:57.850

Only sometimes.

356
00:32:05.566 --> 00:32:07.429
Aw. you sound like mama.

357
00:32:07.531 --> 00:32:08.258
Oh.

358
00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.699
Mm. busy becoming a mama.

359
00:32:10.801 --> 00:32:12.169
Oh my. that's right.

360
00:32:12.271 --> 00:32:14.437
I forgot that ain't your little
tiny beer belly no more.

361
00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:15.405
Oh. stop.

362
00:32:17.675 --> 00:32:18.703

Oh my God.

367
00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:44.803
Ah. maybe don't be

'cause he's saving up
for real one.

00:32:46.071 --> 00:32:47.504
And I kind of like this one

00:32:47.606 --> 00:32:49.207
So. you know.

I'm happy for you. little girl.

373
00:32:54.843 --> 00:32:56.114
Yeah.

374
00:32:58.816 --> 00:33:00.316
So how you doing?

375
00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:08.051
I'm still sober. if that's what
you're asking me right now.

376
00:33:08.154 --> 00:33:09.792
Oh. girl.

377
00:33:09.894 --> 00:33:11.558
That's fucking great!

378
00:33:14.133 --> 00:33:17.333
Come on. you should be proud of
yourself.

379
00:33:19.836 --> 00:33:21.634
What. sweetie?

380
00:33:30.782 --> 00:33:32.615
I'm just so scared.

381
00:33:37.319 --> 00:33:39.891
We trust in your wisdom.

382
00:33:39.993 --> 00:33:42.826
And we look forward to
our boy Conor

383
00:33:42.928 --> 00:33:44.525
getting washed in the blood.

384
00:33:45.597 --> 00:33:46.830
Amen.

385
00:33:46.932 --> 00:33:48.331
EVERYONE
Amen.

386
00:33:50.737 --> 00:33:51.567
Aren't you gonna have any?

387
00:33:52.733 --> 00:33:56.735
Mama. I think Ruby has something
to tell y'all.

388
00:33:58.712 --> 00:34:00.442
Is that right. Darda?

389
00:34:03.279 --> 00:34:08.816
Oh well. we were thinking
about--

390
00:34:08.918 --> 00:34:10.122
Getting hitched.

391
00:34:11.185 --> 00:34:12.724
Hey. how about that?

392
00:34:12.826 --> 00:34:15.452
Well. congratulations. you two.

393
00:34:15.554 --> 00:34:18.056
Shelby John. you're a lucky man.

394
00:34:18.158 --> 00:34:19.659
Yeah. I know.

395
00:34:21.064 --> 00:34:22.827
You didn't even ask me.

396
00:34:29.836 --> 00:34:33.578
Lord knows we've had our share
of differences.

397
00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:35.873
But Ruby is my baby.

398
00:34:37.713 --> 00:34:41.648
You didn't think to ask my
permission to take her hand?

399
00:34:43.917 --> 00:34:46.255
To be honest. since her daddy's
out the picture.

400
00:34:46.357 --> 00:34:49.491
I-- I didn't think about asking
permission.

401
00:34:52.432 --> 00:34:56.861
But I can see now that was sort
of sexist. like on my part.

402
00:34:58.371 --> 00:35:03.004
That baby girl has broke my
heart more than once.

403
00:35:03.106 --> 00:35:06.943
Ain't gonna lie about that now
just 'cause she's gone clean a
couple of weeks.

404
00:35:07.045 --> 00:35:08.647
Clean about over a month. mama.

405
00:35:08.749 --> 00:35:10.908
Mama's talking. Darda.

406
00:35:18.925 --> 00:35:20.289
Greta. with all due respect.

407
00:35:20.391 --> 00:35:22.491
I'm marrying your daughter no
matter what.

408
00:35:24.456 --> 00:35:26.396
What I can do is I--

409
00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:30.466
I can swear to take care of her
till my dying breath.

410
00:35:32.272 --> 00:35:34.734
I suppose what I'm asking for is
a little faith.

411
00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:43.248
Faith is something I do have.

412
00:35:47.813 --> 00:35:51.421
Don't you let me down. Shelby
John.

413
00:35:53.087 --> 00:35:54.391
I won't.

414
00:35:57.290 --> 00:36:01.130
Here I was listening. this fine
day cannot get any sweeter.

415
00:36:01.232 --> 00:36:03.600
but I do love to be proven
wrong.

416
00:36:04.998 --> 00:36:07.898
Because being proven wrong keeps
us humble.

417
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.211
Just. life is filled with trials
and tribulations.

418
00:36:12.943 --> 00:36:14.874
We all struggle.

419
00:36:14.976 --> 00:36:19.279
But it is the way we confront
those struggles that defines us.

420
00:36:19.381 --> 00:36:23.519
So. this to the happy couple.

421
00:36:24.619 --> 00:36:27.523
Welcome to the family.
Shelby John.

422
00:36:33.661 --> 00:36:35.698
Pain in the ass.
don't get me started.

423
00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:36.562
Yeah.

424
00:36:36.664 --> 00:36:38.501
You should come work for me.

425
00:36:39.534 --> 00:36:42.304
It's a good wage. health
insurance.

426
00:36:42.406 --> 00:36:44.769
If Ruby is anything like her
sister.

427
00:36:44.871 --> 00:36:47.609
she's not gonna wait too long to
have a baby.

428
00:36:49.811 --> 00:36:51.046
Hey. you don't have to answer
now.

429
00:36:51.148 --> 00:36:52.750
Just put it back here.

430
00:36:52.852 --> 00:36:53.978
I will. thank you.

431
00:36:55.186 --> 00:36:57.184
I scored us some extra cake.

432
00:36:57.286 --> 00:36:58.950
Can't leave without this.

433
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:01.392
Take it. girl.

434
00:37:03.094 --> 00:37:05.026
Oh my God. are you sure?

435
00:37:05.128 --> 00:37:06.127
Of course. I'm sure.

436
00:37:06.229 --> 00:37:07.299
Go and get it fitted.

437
00:37:08.229 --> 00:37:09.664
Oh.

438
00:37:17.744 --> 00:37:18.610
Do you like it?

439
00:37:18.712 --> 00:37:19.971
It's beautiful.

440
00:37:27.083 --> 00:37:28.280
Thank you.

441
00:37:28.382 --> 00:37:29.585
Thanks.

442
00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:33.216
See you later.

443
00:37:33.318 --> 00:37:34.858

I got nothing planned.
How about yourself?

491
00:40:13.747 --> 00:40:14.513
I don't know. man.

492
00:40:14.615 --> 00:40:15.614
Getting hit with the lady.

00:40:44.249 --> 00:40:45.884

00:40:45.986 --> 00:40:46.947
We cool. ain't we?

500
00:40:50.255 --> 00:40:51.556
I guess we ain't cool.

501
00:40:54.561 --> 00:40:57.357
You gotta chill out once in a
while. soldier.

502
00:40:57.459 --> 00:40:58.662
War is over for you.

503
00:41:00.094 --> 00:41:03.001
I just came by to check up on my
old pal Ruby Red.

504
00:41:03.103 --> 00:41:03.995
Get the fuck out of here

505
00:41:04.097 --> 00:41:06.169
before I knock your teeth down
your throat.

506
00:41:06.271 --> 00:41:07.939
There he is.

507
00:41:08.041 --> 00:41:09.871
Our wild Mustang.

508
00:41:11.741 --> 00:41:13.539
Been a minute
since I've seen him.

509
00:41:34.167 --> 00:41:35.960
What's up. girl?

510
00:41:36.062 --> 00:41:37.866
Just paying a visit
to your old man.

511
00:41:39.203 --> 00:41:40.000
Oh. yeah?

512
00:41:41.267 --> 00:41:42.937
Called me up for a little
special delivery.

513
00:41:48.014 --> 00:41:48.910
Are you serious?

514
00:41:50.512 --> 00:41:52.716
What's the matter?

515
00:41:52.818 --> 00:41:55.312
You know. last thing I wanna do
is get between you two.

516
00:41:56.655 --> 00:41:58.755
Yeah. well. you didn't do
anything wrong.

517
00:42:02.795 --> 00:42:05.157
Don't tell him I told you he's
been using. will you?

518
00:42:07.894 --> 00:42:09.601
Kicking it ain't an easy thing.

519
00:42:12.269 --> 00:42:13.198
Don't I know it?

520
00:42:17.505 --> 00:42:20.612
Hey. here.

521
00:42:25.684 --> 00:42:28.613
Say why should Shelby John have
all the fun?

522
00:42:49.703 --> 00:42:51.940
Baby. hey.

523
00:42:54.313 --> 00:42:56.142
Didn't hear you come in.

524
00:43:05.554 --> 00:43:06.790
Baptism tomorrow.

525
00:43:07.788 --> 00:43:09.287
Yeah. I know. You excited?

526
00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.257
What if I'm just not good
enough?

527
00:43:15.361 --> 00:43:16.932
If you ain't good enough to be
saved. nobody is.

528
00:43:18.367 --> 00:43:19.132
Come on.

529
00:43:24.036 --> 00:43:25.740
Let me put some clothes on.

530
00:43:25.842 --> 00:43:27.239
I'll make you something to eat.
alright?

531
00:44:51.557 --> 00:44:54.662
Okay. baby. before you say
anything I'm not done yet.

532
00:44:54.764 --> 00:44:56.197
I started to sand the floors.

533
00:44:56.299 --> 00:44:58.264
Took out all the bars. and gave
them a first coat. right?

534
00:44:59.672 --> 00:45:01.498
And the yard took me about four
hours.

535
00:45:05.111 --> 00:45:06.041
Ruby?

536
00:45:09.215 --> 00:45:10.144
Hey. Ruby?

537
00:45:11.249 --> 00:45:12.577
Ruby?

538
00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:13.645
Hey. Ruby?

539
00:45:13.747 --> 00:45:15.316
Hey. hey. hey.

540
00:45:15.419 --> 00:45:16.849
Oh. baby.

541
00:45:16.951 --> 00:45:18.383
Baby. hey. come on. wake up.

542
00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:21.089
Oh. fuck.

543
00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:24.427
Oh. f--

544
00:45:24.529 --> 00:45:25.493
Ruby. hey. hey. baby.

545
00:45:25.595 --> 00:45:26.529
Come on. wake up.

546
00:45:26.631 --> 00:45:27.891
Baby. wake up for me. come on.

547
00:45:27.993 --> 00:45:28.893
Hey. Ruby. come on.

548
00:45:28.995 --> 00:45:30.260
Come on. baby. Come on.

549
00:45:30.362 --> 00:45:31.803
Come on. baby. Come on. come on.
come on.

550
00:45:32.502 --> 00:45:33.499
Oh. shit.

551
00:45:33.602 --> 00:45:34.438

When you're remembered. dreamt
about.

609
00:50:31.269 --> 00:50:32.664
Looks like a fallen angel.

610
00:50:34.304 --> 00:50:36.269
I just saw her last week on
Shelby's bike.

611
00:50:36.371 --> 00:50:38.508
She looked happy. they looked
happy.

612
00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:40.545
It wasn't him.

613
00:50:40.647 --> 00:50:42.212
She did this herself.

614
00:50:43.579 --> 00:50:46.345
My guess is Shelby John ain't
gonna be easy to find.

615
00:50:46.447 --> 00:50:49.183
He was always a wild one.
Shelby John.

616
00:50:49.285 --> 00:50:50.885
My boy Mickey
played ball with him.

617
00:50:50.987 --> 00:50:52.916
Called him "Mustang".

618
00:50:53.018 --> 00:50:56.323
Fast as a horse on the fuel.
wild and dangerous off him.

619
00:50:56.425 --> 00:50:57.694
So this Mustang can kick.

620
00:50:57.796 --> 00:50:59.160
Oh. he can kick alright

621
00:50:59.262 --> 00:51:01.231
but he won't screw with his
burbon.

622
00:51:02.131 --> 00:51:04.163
He didn't start that fight.

623
00:51:04.266 --> 00:51:06.003
I'm sure as hell
he'll finish it.

624
00:51:06.105 --> 00:51:08.132
Or maybe it's not too late for
Shelby John.

625
00:51:08.234 --> 00:51:09.236
It's gotta be me.

626
00:51:09.338 --> 00:51:11.639
If anybody else gets to him
first--

627
00:51:11.741 --> 00:51:12.941
Sheriff.

628
00:51:29.455 --> 00:51:31.393
They were fixing the place up.

629
00:51:36.466 --> 00:51:38.862
Shelby John's problem
is knowing when to stop.

630
00:51:43.706 --> 00:51:46.642
If you find him. you stay calm
and tell him I just wanna talk.

631
00:51:46.744 --> 00:51:47.611
That's all.

632
00:51:47.713 --> 00:51:48.872
You got it. boss.

633
00:51:57.953 --> 00:51:59.188
Who is it?

634
00:51:59.291 --> 00:52:01.588
Friend of your dad's.
Go get him.

635
00:52:01.690 --> 00:52:04.557
If you're a friend. you know not
to come here for drug.

636
00:52:04.659 --> 00:52:06.026
Get your daddy. or I'm gonna
kick down

637
00:52:06.128 --> 00:52:07.729
this whole goddamn wall.

638
00:52:07.831 --> 00:52:08.830
Whatever. dude.

639
00:52:08.932 --> 00:52:10.366
It's your funeral.

640
00:52:12.938 --> 00:52:14.733
Dad. some fucker's at the door.

641
00:52:20.208 --> 00:52:21.677
I'll take care of this.

642
00:52:23.815 --> 00:52:24.809
Who is it?

643
00:52:26.116 --> 00:52:27.749
Hey. move your hand. asshole.

644
00:52:31.451 --> 00:52:32.520
Fuck. man. Shelby?

645
00:52:33.891 --> 00:52:36.260
Stay the fuck down.

646
00:52:36.362 --> 00:52:37.825
Shelby. whatever he done. I'm
sure it was a mistake.

647
00:52:37.927 --> 00:52:38.829
He didn't mean--

648
00:52:38.931 --> 00:52:40.726
Take your kids fuck out of here.

649
00:52:42.968 --> 00:52:44.162
You wanna stay or you wanna go?

650
00:52:44.264 --> 00:52:45.703
I'll go. I'll go.

651
00:52:45.805 --> 00:52:47.033
I'm sorry. baby.

652
00:53:13.465 --> 00:53:16.031
I fucking told you. and I told
you again we were clean.

653
00:53:16.133 --> 00:53:17.262
I won't give Ruby nothing else.

654
00:53:17.364 --> 00:53:19.132
I'll-- I'll stay away.

655
00:53:19.234 --> 00:53:20.703
Don't even gotta pay me.

656
00:53:20.805 --> 00:53:21.899
She's dead.

657
00:53:24.205 --> 00:53:25.138
Fuck!

658
00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:26.711
I'm so sorry. Shelby.

659
00:53:26.813 --> 00:53:27.839
You gotta understand.

660
00:53:27.941 --> 00:53:29.709
I've been getting squeezed to
bring my numbers up.

661
00:53:35.953 --> 00:53:36.947
What'd you give her?

662
00:53:38.219 --> 00:53:39.785
Just a little smack.

663
00:53:40.893 --> 00:53:42.990
She got Smack. what else?

664
00:53:43.092 --> 00:53:44.295
That's--that's it.

665
00:53:48.165 --> 00:53:49.864
I said what else?

666
00:53:49.966 --> 00:53:52.201
I had to cut it.

667
00:53:52.303 --> 00:53:53.562
I told you. I've been getting
squeezed

668
00:53:53.664 --> 00:53:54.833
like you wouldn't believe.

669
00:53:56.271 --> 00:53:57.440
Who is your supplier?

670
00:53:58.303 --> 00:53:59.836
What?

671
00:53:59.938 --> 00:54:01.439
Give me his name and maybe I'll
leave here

672
00:54:01.541 --> 00:54:02.945
while you're still breathing.

673
00:54:03.047 --> 00:54:04.007
I can't give you that.

674
00:54:08.185 --> 00:54:09.982
Please don't fucking kill me.

675
00:54:11.157 --> 00:54:13.388
Please don't fucking kill me.

676
00:54:13.490 --> 00:54:15.458

678
00:54:19.265 --> 00:54:20.757

comes from.

Everybody is.

696
00:55:32.438 --> 00:55:34.037
DISPATCH OFFICER 1

00:55:39.138 --> 00:55:42.308
Suspect's armed and can be seen

700
00:55:42.410 --> 00:55:43.940
Headed northbound on 185.

Oh!

705
00:56:45.273 --> 00:56:46.609
Hi there.

706
00:56:51.050 --> 00:56:52.175
Where did you come from?

707
00:56:55.517 --> 00:56:57.782
You got your mama over there?

708
00:56:57.884 --> 00:56:59.886
Think you better go back to your
mama.

709
00:57:04.057 --> 00:57:06.261
Jesus Christ died for our sins.

710
00:57:06.363 --> 00:57:08.529
Elvis Kincaid died for his own.

711
00:57:08.631 --> 00:57:11.062
Nailed straight through the
forehead.

712
00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:15.506
Church. you questioned the
family?

713
00:57:16.842 --> 00:57:18.036
Church?

714
00:57:19.438 --> 00:57:20.137

00:57:21.276 --> 00:57:23.679
Yeah. I got it.

716
00:57:25.383 --> 00:57:26.248
Oh. come on. Sheriff.

717
00:57:26.350 --> 00:57:27.649
How long we're gonna be here?

718
00:57:27.751 --> 00:57:29.248
We've already been through
enough tonight already.

719
00:57:29.350 --> 00:57:30.553
I know it. Jess.

720
00:57:30.655 --> 00:57:31.848
But I wouldn't be asking if it
wasn't important.

721
00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:33.783
I just want to talk to the
oldest.

722
00:57:33.885 --> 00:57:35.388
Well. that's Travis.

723
00:57:35.490 --> 00:57:37.259

00:57:38.458 --> 00:57:40.163
Right. let's go.

726
00:57:40.265 --> 00:57:42.228
You're on babysitting duty.

727
00:57:42.330 --> 00:57:44.001
The hell I am.

728
00:57:44.103 --> 00:57:45.064
How old are you?

729
00:57:45.166 --> 00:57:46.264
11.

730
00:57:46.366 --> 00:57:47.066

731
00:57:47.168 --> 00:57:48.165
11.

732
00:57:50.775 --> 00:57:53.370
You know. my son used to play
football with your dad.

733
00:57:53.472 --> 00:57:55.109
Really?

734
00:57:55.211 --> 00:57:56.039
Was he any good?

735
00:57:56.141 --> 00:57:58.113
Yeah. your dad held his own on
the line.

736
00:57:58.215 --> 00:57:58.980
He had a good team.

737
00:57:59.083 --> 00:58:00.243
Damn good.

738
00:58:01.653 --> 00:58:03.415
You know what your old man did
for a living?

739
00:58:03.517 --> 00:58:05.487
Umm...

740
00:58:05.589 --> 00:58:07.022
Don't look to your mama now.

741
00:58:07.124 --> 00:58:08.724
Now. come on.

742
00:58:08.826 --> 00:58:12.195
Well. my friends used to say my
dad was the best dad.

743
00:58:12.297 --> 00:58:14.858
Like. taking care of people.

744
00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:17.033
Taking care of people how?

745
00:58:17.135 --> 00:58:18.802
Like. with medicine.

746
00:58:18.904 --> 00:58:19.531
Travis?

747
00:58:19.633 --> 00:58:21.199
No. shut your mouth. Jess.

748
00:58:21.301 --> 00:58:24.069
Or we all spend the rest of the
night in interrogation room.

749
00:58:25.478 --> 00:58:27.270
You know where you dad keeps his
medicine?

750
00:58:29.114 --> 00:58:30.981
Travis. look at me.

751
00:58:31.083 --> 00:58:32.178
I don't know. sir.

752
00:58:32.281 --> 00:58:33.782
I'm sorry.

753
00:59:11.719 --> 00:59:13.791
Watch it. What the fuck. man?

754
00:59:13.893 --> 00:59:15.153
Asshole.

755
00:59:17.427 --> 00:59:19.228
Excuse me. can I help you?

756
00:59:19.330 --> 00:59:20.924
I've come to see a friend.

757
00:59:21.026 --> 00:59:22.461

758
01:00:39.542 --> 01:00:40.777
Hey. how you guys doing?

01:00:41.841 --> 01:00:42.873
How you doing. Mister?

760
01:00:42.976 --> 01:00:44.275
I'm doing pretty good.

761
01:00:45.382 --> 01:00:46.950
You guys partying?

762
01:00:47.053 --> 01:00:48.618
Oh. shit.

763
01:00:48.721 --> 01:00:50.550
You know where I can buy me some
of them pills?

764
01:00:50.652 --> 01:00:52.888
We got no pills. officer.

765
01:00:56.690 --> 01:00:57.755
Can you not do that?

766
01:00:57.857 --> 01:00:59.258
My fucking nose. man.

767
01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:00.022
Hey.

768
01:01:00.124 --> 01:01:01.859
Let Kenny go. Please. Mister.

769
01:01:01.961 --> 01:01:02.760
He didn't mean nothing by it.

770
01:01:02.862 --> 01:01:04.228
I asked him a question.

771
01:01:04.330 --> 01:01:05.596
Our friend Skeeter. he gets the
pills from someone

772
01:01:05.698 --> 01:01:06.499
down the hall.

773
01:01:06.601 --> 01:01:07.738
Oh yeah?

774
01:01:08.535 --> 01:01:09.336
Skeeter?

775
01:01:09.438 --> 01:01:10.139
Which room?

776
01:01:10.241 --> 01:01:10.874
Don't tell him.

777
01:01:10.976 --> 01:01:12.437
Hey.

778
01:01:12.539 --> 01:01:14.107
1507.

779
01:01:15.576 --> 01:01:17.608
1507. Thank you.

780
01:01:17.710 --> 01:01:19.079
Thanks. Kenny.

781
01:01:22.452 --> 01:01:24.216
Ah. that's right.

782
01:01:26.790 --> 01:01:31.124
Oxycodone. D-- Demerol.

783
01:01:32.023 --> 01:01:33.490
It's a form of fentanyl.

784
01:01:33.592 --> 01:01:37.130
No doubt that Kincaid was
putting this into his heroin.

785
01:01:37.232 --> 01:01:40.466
This little brick has left a
whole lot of searching

786
01:01:40.568 --> 01:01:41.937
in its wake.

787
01:01:46.343 --> 01:01:47.837
Who that?

788
01:01:47.939 --> 01:01:49.241
Kenny.

789
01:01:50.508 --> 01:01:53.850
Oh. do you need some more shit.
huh. college boy?

790
01:01:58.518 --> 01:01:59.288
Ah!

791
01:01:59.390 --> 01:01:59.949
Oh my God.

792
01:02:00.051 --> 01:02:01.221
Fucking hell.

793
01:02:01.323 --> 01:02:01.785
Hey.

794
01:02:01.887 --> 01:02:04.126
Ah! Ah!

795
01:02:04.229 --> 01:02:05.359
Fuck. ah!

796
01:02:05.461 --> 01:02:05.954
Jesus. fuck.

797
01:02:06.056 --> 01:02:06.757
Stay down.

798
01:02:06.859 --> 01:02:08.161
Alright. stay down!

799
01:02:08.263 --> 01:02:09.794
You can suck my dick. you
fucking bitch-ass.

800
01:02:09.896 --> 01:02:11.797
No. I'm good. Tell him.

801
01:02:11.899 --> 01:02:13.837
Man said stay down. Skeeter.

802
01:02:14.999 --> 01:02:16.840
Time to go. ladies.

803
01:02:23.315 --> 01:02:24.443
So that's Skeeter.

804
01:02:24.545 --> 01:02:25.475
You are?

805
01:02:26.547 --> 01:02:27.545
Darius.

806
01:02:27.647 --> 01:02:29.013
Darius.

807
01:02:29.115 --> 01:02:30.854
You can call me. "the Kin
killer".

808
01:02:32.182 --> 01:02:34.891
Oh. just heard about that.

809
01:02:36.561 --> 01:02:38.461
Kincaid was a piece of shit.

810
01:02:38.563 --> 01:02:40.393
But the man did have a family.

811
01:02:40.496 --> 01:02:41.491
You know?

812
01:02:42.563 --> 01:02:43.793
I don't.

813
01:02:43.895 --> 01:02:45.594
Not anymore.

814
01:02:45.696 --> 01:02:48.637
Not since you were leaning on
Kincaid to sell more.

815
01:02:48.739 --> 01:02:50.668
I'm getting leaned on too.
brother.

816
01:02:50.770 --> 01:02:51.570
Believe me.

817
01:02:51.672 --> 01:02:52.841
You want money?

818
01:02:52.944 --> 01:02:55.272
There's 10 grand right there in
front of you.

819
01:02:55.374 --> 01:02:57.240
I got no need for money where
I'm going.

820
01:02:57.342 --> 01:02:58.677
You got that right.

821
01:02:58.779 --> 01:03:00.411

824
01:03:11.923 --> 01:03:12.690
You let me walk.

825
01:03:12.792 --> 01:03:13.628
Fuck. Darius.

826
01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:14.957
You wanna get us both gutted?

827

Ah! Fuck.

829
01:03:21.404 --> 01:03:22.705
Coyote?

830
01:03:22.807 --> 01:03:24.074
That's what he calls himself.

831
01:03:24.176 --> 01:03:25.467
Yeah.

832
01:03:25.569 --> 01:03:28.208
And I know something he don't

That's what they're saying. huh?

840
01:03:49.699 --> 01:03:51.066
That's what this is about?

841
01:03:52.166 --> 01:03:53.968
Your dumb bitch
can't handle her shit.

842
01:03:54.070 --> 01:03:55.668
So you come around here swinging

843
01:03:55.770 --> 01:03:57.274

I truly am.

850
01:04:17.189 --> 01:04:19.927
But I didn't even know her.

851
01:04:20.029 --> 01:04:21.525
That's what make it worse.
isn't it?

852
01:04:23.228 --> 01:04:25.027
It didn't matter to Kincaid.

853
01:04:25.129 --> 01:04:26.398
Don't matter to you.

854
01:04:27.765 --> 01:04:30.836
Don't matter to some dumb fuck
calls himself "Coyote".

855
01:04:30.938 --> 01:04:32.707
So where does he live?

856
01:04:32.809 --> 01:04:34.937

Excuse us.

892
01:07:29.418 --> 01:07:31.213
His manners can sometimes get
away from him

893
01:07:31.315 --> 01:07:32.716
this late at night.

894
01:07:37.127 --> 01:07:38.623
Do you know the man done this to
you?

895
01:07:40.057 --> 01:07:40.860
Huh?

896
01:07:40.962 --> 01:07:42.125
I ain't saying shit.

897
01:07:42.227 --> 01:07:42.960
I know my rights.

898
01:07:43.062 --> 01:07:43.931
Do you now?

899
01:07:44.033 --> 01:07:45.597
Sound like you're on a TV show.

900
01:07:46.738 --> 01:07:48.605
That must hurt some awful.

901
01:07:48.707 --> 01:07:49.505
Got some painkillers?

902
01:07:49.607 --> 01:07:51.608
Some good shit?

903
01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:52.835
Fuck out of here. man.

Ah. fuck!

905
01:07:56.645 --> 01:07:57.739
Ah!

906
01:07:57.842 --> 01:08:00.075
Maybe they didn't give you good
shit after all.

907
01:08:00.178 --> 01:08:01.547
Oh. fuck.

908
01:08:01.649 --> 01:08:03.453
If he left you alive. you must
have told him something.

909
01:08:03.555 --> 01:08:04.181
What was it?

910
01:08:04.283 --> 01:08:06.752
I didn't say nothing. man.

911
01:08:06.854 --> 01:08:08.191
Come on.

912
01:08:08.293 --> 01:08:09.857
If he left you alive. you must
have told him something.

913
01:08:09.959 --> 01:08:10.889
I didn't say nothing.

914
01:08:10.991 --> 01:08:11.727
So what was it?

915
01:08:11.829 --> 01:08:13.191

01:08:15.964 --> 01:08:17.159
Stop. please. stop!

919
01:08:17.261 --> 01:08:18.063
What was it?

920
01:08:18.165 --> 01:08:19.163
Stop. please just stop!

921
01:08:19.265 --> 01:08:20.164
I'm not gonna let go.

922
01:08:20.266 --> 01:08:21.635
You tell me what it was.

923
01:08:21.737 --> 01:08:23.402
Fuck.

924
01:08:23.504 --> 01:08:25.135
You think this is piece of your
knee cap?

925
01:08:26.408 --> 01:08:26.970
You think this is piece of your
knee cap?

926
01:08:27.073 --> 01:08:28.576
Ah. fuck!

927
01:08:28.679 --> 01:08:29.678
Huh? Okay.

928
01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:31.912
Okay. okay. okay.

929
01:08:32.014 --> 01:08:32.911
I didn't say nothing. man.

930
01:08:33.013 --> 01:08:34.049
I swear it.

931
01:08:34.151 --> 01:08:35.917
It was fucking Darius told him.
okay?

932
01:08:36.019 --> 01:08:37.951
Now what did Darius tell him?

933
01:08:38.053 --> 01:08:39.884
What'd Darius tell him?

934
01:08:39.987 --> 01:08:41.523
Fuck man!

935
01:08:45.026 --> 01:08:46.592
Fuck!

936
01:08:59.570 --> 01:09:00.675
You alright?

937
01:09:00.777 --> 01:09:02.740
Was it a deer?

938
01:09:35.645 --> 01:09:38.281
You wanna tell me what's going
on. Sheriff?

939
01:09:45.919 --> 01:09:47.290
I--

940
01:09:48.593 --> 01:09:49.985
I saw--

941
01:09:52.562 --> 01:09:55.661
It may have been a few years
since it happened last.

942
01:09:59.304 --> 01:10:02.167
I didn't see him how he was when
he died.

943
01:10:02.269 --> 01:10:03.606
You know. grown and all.

944
01:10:03.708 --> 01:10:06.104
I see making--

945
01:10:06.206 --> 01:10:07.071
I see my little boy.

946
01:10:07.173 --> 01:10:08.443
I see him--

947
01:10:09.841 --> 01:10:14.350
I see him as my little-- my
little boy.

948
01:10:24.426 --> 01:10:27.858
I missed my-- my chance to save
him.

949
01:10:32.398 --> 01:10:34.271
I seen my sister once.

950
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:38.140
She said that life is a river

951
01:10:38.242 --> 01:10:40.938
that eventually spills into the
ocean.

952
01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:45.315
And when you get to the delta
where the river meets the sea.

953
01:10:45.417 --> 01:10:48.311
that's where your loved ones
will be waiting for you.

954
01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:57.892
Well. maybe it's not too late
for Shelby John.

955
01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:39.495
How many more? Let's go.

956
01:11:39.597 --> 01:11:40.936
What's taking so long?

957
01:11:41.038 --> 01:11:42.430
Load it up. load it up.

958
01:11:42.532 --> 01:11:43.335
We gotta move.

959
01:11:43.437 --> 01:11:45.336
Boss wants us out the door.

960
01:11:45.438 --> 01:11:46.673
Go grab mine.

961
01:11:53.013 --> 01:11:54.417
You.

962
01:11:56.282 --> 01:11:57.085
Hey. hey.

963
01:11:57.187 --> 01:11:58.414
Whoa. whoa. easy. easy. man.

964
01:11:58.516 --> 01:11:59.485
Shut up.

965
01:11:59.587 --> 01:12:00.852
Come on. bro. what happened?

966
01:12:02.761 --> 01:12:04.992
Easy. easy.

967
01:12:05.094 --> 01:12:06.288
Okay. okay. okay.

968
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:07.894
No. no.

969
01:12:07.996 --> 01:12:09.260
No. man.

970
01:12:17.107 --> 01:12:18.639
Clean this shit up. man.

971
01:12:28.119 --> 01:12:28.883
Let's go. gentlemen.

972
01:12:28.985 --> 01:12:29.885
Load it up.

973
01:12:29.987 --> 01:12:30.613
Come on. let's go.

974
01:12:30.715 --> 01:12:32.389
Boss wants us out of the door.

975
01:12:33.321 --> 01:12:34.188
We're good.

976
01:12:34.291 --> 01:12:35.388
Alright man. hurry up.

977
01:12:35.490 --> 01:12:38.125
Take the back roads. don't
forget.

978
01:12:38.227 --> 01:12:39.422
Back roads. huh?

979
01:13:01.853 --> 01:13:03.413
Go. go. go. go.

980
01:13:17.234 --> 01:13:18.868
Yo. what the fuck was that?

981
01:14:16.627 --> 01:14:19.095
In what I've seen over the years
of hell.

982
01:14:19.197 --> 01:14:20.891
just over the past 24 hours.

983
01:14:20.994 --> 01:14:23.893
this beast is more complex than
we ever thought.

984
01:14:23.995 --> 01:14:25.729
Every time we cut off one
tentacle.

985
01:14:25.831 --> 01:14:27.735
another one sneaks
up in its place.

You stay here. secure the
perimeter.

998
01:19:17.027 --> 01:19:18.391

1003
01:19:29.438 --> 01:19:30.532
Fuck you.

1004
01:19:34.641 --> 01:19:36.043
Open wide.

1005
01:19:37.742 --> 01:19:40.949

1012
01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:06.139
What the fuck is this about?

1013
01:20:07.478 --> 01:20:08.509
I don't know.

1014
01:20:08.611 --> 01:20:10.275
Wrong number. my bad.

1015
01:20:11.879 --> 01:20:13.612
Who the fuck do you work for?

1016
01:20:13.714 --> 01:20:16.116

1022
01:20:27.693 --> 01:20:28.397
Mike?

1023
01:20:28.499 --> 01:20:29.791
Time to end this. son.

1024
01:20:29.893 --> 01:20:31.197
Come on.

1025
01:20:32.064 --> 01:20:33.628
I come to bring you home. son.

1026
01:20:34.937 --> 01:20:35.830
There ain't no home for me no
more.

1027
01:20:35.933 --> 01:20:36.901
I know it.

1028
01:20:37.003 --> 01:20:37.834
But Ruby made her own choices.

1029
01:20:37.936 --> 01:20:39.100
Same as Maken did.

1030
01:20:39.202 --> 01:20:40.236
I don't like it neither.

1031
01:20:40.338 --> 01:20:42.044
but that don't make it any less
true.

1032
01:20:42.146 --> 01:20:44.978
and beating this pile of shit to
death won't bring her back.

1033
01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:46.282
As soon as my lawyer's done with
your ass--

1034
01:20:46.384 --> 01:20:48.478
Will you shut up?

1035
01:20:48.580 --> 01:20:50.645
I may be crazy. Sheriff. but I
ain't stupid.

1036
01:20:52.182 --> 01:20:53.316
Yeah. Ruby had choices.

1037
01:20:53.419 --> 01:20:55.122
but some of them choices were
made for her.

1038
01:20:56.460 --> 01:20:57.623
I tried to protect--

1039
01:20:57.725 --> 01:20:59.126
I tried to protect--

1040
01:21:02.191 --> 01:21:04.098
Don't do it. please.

1041
01:21:06.029 --> 01:21:07.535
Please. Mike.

1042
01:21:07.637 --> 01:21:09.765
Do it. Come on. end this.

1043
01:21:09.867 --> 01:21:10.901
No. no.

1044
01:21:11.003 --> 01:21:14.001
Please. bring me mercy.

1045
01:21:14.103 --> 01:21:16.341
Either you do it. or I'm gonna
shoot this motherfucker right
here.

1046
01:21:17.682 --> 01:21:19.645
Drop the weapon.

1047
01:21:19.747 --> 01:21:22.076
Lieutenant. please.

1048
01:21:22.178 --> 01:21:23.319
I've lost too much.

1049
01:21:23.421 --> 01:21:25.046
I know.

1050
01:21:25.148 --> 01:21:26.486
Ain't no way. son.

1051
01:21:26.588 --> 01:21:27.688
Not like this.

1052
01:21:27.790 --> 01:21:28.486
I've lost too much.

1053
01:21:28.588 --> 01:21:29.590
No.

1054
01:21:29.692 --> 01:21:30.523
This ain't how you win.

1055
01:21:30.625 --> 01:21:31.391
Not on my watch.

1056
01:21:31.493 --> 01:21:32.623
Come on.

1057
01:21:32.725 --> 01:21:33.690
Come on.

1058
01:21:33.792 --> 01:21:35.659
Come on.

1059
01:21:35.761 --> 01:21:37.098
Come on.

1060
01:21:40.999 --> 01:21:42.700
You can't do this.

1061
01:21:42.802 --> 01:21:44.666
Come on. huh?

1062
01:22:12.032 --> 01:22:13.497
Help me get her out of here.

1063
01:22:14.704 --> 01:22:15.802
Can't go back that way.

1064
01:22:15.904 --> 01:22:17.270
Let's get her down to the road.

1065
01:22:21.644 --> 01:22:23.707
Wait. wait. stop.

1066
01:22:23.809 --> 01:22:25.645
Please.

1067
01:22:25.747 --> 01:22:26.708
We need your help.

1068
01:22:27.814 --> 01:22:29.650
She's been shot.

1069
01:22:29.752 --> 01:22:31.020
Is she alright?

1070
01:22:31.122 --> 01:22:32.519
No please. we need to get her in
the back of the truck.

1071

Well. hurry up.

1072

Hey. you save her. Mike.

Come on. You say something to me

1077
01:22:56.076 --> 01:22:57.611
Come on. you can say something.

01:25:29.933 --> 01:25:32.028
And now you're doing God's work.

1101
01:25:32.130 --> 01:25:33.499
Is that it?

1102
01:25:35.668 --> 01:25:40.339
You think God approves of what
you've been doing?

1103
01:25:40.442 --> 01:25:42.574
You know. I didn't want to admit
it to myself.

1104
01:25:43.875 --> 01:25:46.611
But I was relieved when Sheriff
Church caught up to me.

1105
01:25:46.713 --> 01:25:49.383
Didn't know I wanted to be
stopped until I was stopped.

1106
01:25:52.449 --> 01:25:54.322
And things kept going.

1107
01:25:55.385 --> 01:25:56.852
Out of my control.

1108
01:25:58.460 --> 01:26:00.861
If that wasn't God pushing me to
do his business.

1109
01:26:00.963 --> 01:26:02.594
I don't know what it was.

1110
01:26:06.435 --> 01:26:09.469
Everything I've done.
I've done for my family.

1111
01:26:14.472 --> 01:26:16.306
Does Darlene know what you do?

1112
01:26:16.408 --> 01:26:18.577
Don't you worry about Darlene.

1113
01:26:22.048 --> 01:26:23.450
And Conor?

1114
01:26:23.552 --> 01:26:27.221
Boy's sound asleep upstairs. not
a care in the world.

1115
01:26:27.324 --> 01:26:30.517
Because all his needs are
provided for him.

1116
01:26:30.619 --> 01:26:34.362
Think he'd feel the same if he
knew how his daddy bought all
these nice things?

1117
01:26:43.901 --> 01:26:49.239
When God commanded Abraham to
slay his son.

1118
01:26:49.341 --> 01:26:50.845
Abraham did not refuse.

1119
01:26:50.947 --> 01:26:53.214
He was ready to comply.

1120
01:26:53.316 --> 01:26:55.845
See. that is the story that
scares people.

1121
01:26:57.019 --> 01:26:58.114
Even though it's a faith.

1122
01:26:58.216 --> 01:26:59.685
But not me.

1123
01:26:59.787 --> 01:27:02.987
Because Abraham understood he
was part of something bigger

1124
01:27:03.089 --> 01:27:04.623
than himself.

1125
01:27:04.725 --> 01:27:07.725
Bigger than his son who he loved
with all his heart.

1126
01:27:09.795 --> 01:27:13.929
We cannot pretend to understand
the mind of God.

1127
01:27:15.268 --> 01:27:16.797
We can only sacrifice

1128
01:27:16.899 --> 01:27:20.606
what we are called upon to
sacrifice.

1129
01:27:29.052 --> 01:27:31.485
It started with a simple favor.

1130
01:27:32.517 --> 01:27:34.950
I had over extended myself.

1131
01:27:36.260 --> 01:27:39.860
I was on the verge of losing
everything.

1132
01:27:39.962 --> 01:27:42.562
Then I met a man.

1133
01:27:42.664 --> 01:27:46.396
It was not on no crossroads or
anything so dramatic.

1134
01:27:46.498 --> 01:27:48.601
And he offered me a lifeline.

1135
01:27:51.101 --> 01:27:55.069
And all I had to do was
transport something for him.

1136
01:27:56.441 --> 01:27:59.510
I told myself at the time.

1137
01:27:59.612 --> 01:28:03.452
"You are making bargain with the
devil."

1138
01:28:03.554 --> 01:28:07.955
But I said to myself. "This is--
it's just this one time."

1139
01:28:08.057 --> 01:28:09.253
Darlene was pregnant.

1140
01:28:09.355 --> 01:28:10.959
We were gonna lose house.

1141
01:28:11.061 --> 01:28:13.461
So I did the man his favor.

1142
01:28:15.329 --> 01:28:17.597
God did not strike me down.

1143
01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.664
God rewarded me.

1144
01:28:20.766 --> 01:28:25.207
And I do not mean with earthly
possessions.

1145
01:28:25.309 --> 01:28:29.670
I'm talking about new found
sense of peace

1146
01:28:29.772 --> 01:28:33.742
of self-reliance so strong.

1147
01:28:33.844 --> 01:28:37.551
that when the man came calling
again.

1148
01:28:40.150 --> 01:28:46.388
I took what belonged to him for
myself. and I never.

1149
01:28:46.490 --> 01:28:48.364
ever looked back.

1150
01:28:49.995 --> 01:28:53.996
I left my old self behind like
the husk of a cicada.

1151
01:28:55.233 --> 01:28:57.439
