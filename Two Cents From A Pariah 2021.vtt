-Hey. God bless you. sir.
-Yeah.

7
00:00:37.083 --> 00:00:38.169
Yeah. this is Donovan.

8
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.917
I'm coming up.
Be there in a minute.

[distorted cha-ching]

11
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.380
Thank you so much for coming.
I'm sorry I'm like this.

12
00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:56.753
No need to be sorry.

13
00:00:57.956 --> 00:00:59.980
You're going through
a very difficult time.

14
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.316
Losing a significant other
can be an almost...

15
00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:06.108
incomprehensible assault
on the senses.

16
00:01:06.745 --> 00:01:08.995
-You're so kind.
-Just here to help.

17
00:01:10.573 --> 00:01:11.573
I'm...

18
00:01:12.487 --> 00:01:14.972
I'm inheriting a large amount
of my husband's money.

19
00:01:16.535 --> 00:01:18.200
When I signed the prenup
three years ago

20
00:01:18.283 --> 00:01:19.759
I actually felt good about it.

21
00:01:21.595 --> 00:01:22.994
But it feels dirty now.

22
00:01:26.298 --> 00:01:28.395
No one doubts
you loved your husband.

23
00:01:28.478 --> 00:01:29.478
Mrs. Daugherty.

24
00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.152
You were by his side
every step of the way.

25
00:01:32.235 --> 00:01:33.235
You deserve...

26
00:01:33.884 --> 00:01:35.345
everything that's coming to you.

27
00:01:36.994 --> 00:01:38.039
I cheated on him.

28
00:01:39.392 --> 00:01:40.851
The whole time I was with him.

29
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.134
There were so many other men.

30
00:01:47.884 --> 00:01:48.884
Was he aware?

31
00:01:49.664 --> 00:01:50.664
I don't think so.

32
00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:54.114
We all make mistakes.

33
00:01:55.447 --> 00:01:57.145
But when I found out
he was sick.

34
00:01:57.228 --> 00:01:59.095
and I asked the doctor
how long...

35
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.986
I wasn't thinking about...

36
00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:05.033
his pain.

37
00:02:07.744 --> 00:02:10.203
Or what he must be feeling.
I was thinking about...

38
00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:13.284
how long it'd be
until he'd be gone

39
00:02:13.367 --> 00:02:14.687
and I could have his money.

40
00:02:16.768 --> 00:02:18.722
How long until I could...

41
00:02:19.408 --> 00:02:21.141
stop sneaking around.

42
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.658
My-- my daughter...

43
00:02:27.228 --> 00:02:29.486
she's actually older than me.
My step-daughter.

44
00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:33.773
When she looks at me
it's like she knows.

45
00:02:35.797 --> 00:02:36.797
Everything.

46
00:02:38.523 --> 00:02:39.920
Are you afraid she'll...

47
00:02:40.803 --> 00:02:42.436
-Expose you in some way.
-No.

48
00:02:43.414 --> 00:02:44.414
I don't know. I...

49
00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:46.367
Do you mind
if I run to the bathroom?

50
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.605
No. of course.

51
00:02:47.688 --> 00:02:49.418
-Thanks. I'll be right back.
-Sure.

52
00:03:04.242 --> 00:03:05.242
[sighs]

53
00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:25.941

[footsteps]

56
00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.299
Sorry about that.

57
00:03:40.805 --> 00:03:43.094
You must think
I'm a sick person.

58
00:03:44.446 --> 00:03:45.883
On the contrary...

59
00:03:46.977 --> 00:03:48.895
what you're feeling
is perfectly natural.

60
00:03:49.172 --> 00:03:50.172
It'll pass.

61
00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:53.790
The money.

62
00:03:54.258 --> 00:03:56.319
You could choose
to do great things with it.

63
00:03:56.753 --> 00:03:58.433
For yourself.
for others. charity.

64
00:03:59.573 --> 00:04:01.689
You do what you think is right.
and you'll...

65
00:04:01.772 --> 00:04:03.875
you'll find you'll drive out
the negativity.

66
00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:04.958
Like...

67
00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:06.955
an infection
through the bloodstream.

68
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.790
You'll feel like a new person.

69
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:12.950
What about the past?

70
00:04:15.067 --> 00:04:16.798
You do the right thing
long enough...

71
00:04:18.278 --> 00:04:20.260
you'll feel like the past
was never there.

72
00:04:23.486 --> 00:04:24.486
Trust me.

73
00:04:26.947 --> 00:04:29.839
Alright. I have
some calls to make

74
00:04:29.922 --> 00:04:31.571
and a few errands. but...

75
00:04:33.291 --> 00:04:35.580
-Here you are.
-Oh. thank you.

76
00:04:38.501 --> 00:04:39.814
So we'll speak again soon?

77
00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:42.197
I'd like that.

78
00:05:30.465 --> 00:05:31.465
[elevator beeps]

79
00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:38.060
[assistant] Good morning.
Mr. Strathmore.

80
00:05:38.143 --> 00:05:39.260
Good morning.

81
00:05:40.307 --> 00:05:42.268
-How are you today?
-I'm well. thank you.

82
00:05:42.932 --> 00:05:44.511
So what's on the docket
for today?

83
00:05:45.568 --> 00:05:48.348
It looks like you have a meeting
with Paul Anderson.

84
00:05:48.873 --> 00:05:51.766
And the McGuires
would like to see you tomorrow

85
00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:53.353
if that's alright.

86
00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:55.423
I didn't know
they were back from LA.

87
00:05:55.506 --> 00:05:56.506
Yeah.

88
00:05:57.482 --> 00:05:58.482
Paul Anderson.

89
00:05:59.052 --> 00:06:00.256
He say anything specific?

90
00:06:01.295 --> 00:06:04.239
Just that he'd like to see you
at his office instead of home.

91
00:06:04.673 --> 00:06:05.673
Okay.

92
00:06:15.507 --> 00:06:16.507
Thank you for coming.

93
00:06:17.523 --> 00:06:19.629
Of course. Paul.
What can I do for you today?

94
00:06:21.693 --> 00:06:22.857
Well. for starters..

95
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.662
you remember that NDA form
I had you sign?

96
00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:27.529
Of course.

97
00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:29.849
Good.

98
00:06:31.637 --> 00:06:32.887
Alright [sighs].

99
00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:34.909
So...

100
00:06:35.621 --> 00:06:39.024
A little while ago
I hired a dominatrix.

101
00:06:40.596 --> 00:06:41.596
Yeah.

102
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.182
You know.
to shake things up a bit.

103
00:06:45.682 --> 00:06:47.324
Nance doesn't know about her.

104
00:06:47.813 --> 00:06:48.813
Obviously.

105
00:06:49.618 --> 00:06:51.704
I do. and now you do.

106
00:06:52.524 --> 00:06:54.080
And I'd like
to keep it that way.

107
00:06:57.061 --> 00:07:00.038
Anyway. it was great at first.
I'll admit.

108
00:07:00.741 --> 00:07:02.679
She's fun. Oh. is she fun.

109
00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:08.140
She's a real mind fucker
if you know what I mean.

110
00:07:09.405 --> 00:07:12.515
But now I feel
that it's started to get

111
00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:13.598
into the deep end.

112
00:07:14.585 --> 00:07:15.624
And I want to end it.

113
00:07:16.913 --> 00:07:19.643
But I just can't seem
to get free of her.

114
00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:23.122
Are you feeling
financially constrained

115
00:07:23.205 --> 00:07:25.107
as a result
of her continuing services?

116
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.656
No. I can afford it.

117
00:07:29.596 --> 00:07:32.393
That's not the problem.
It's more in my mind.

118
00:07:33.575 --> 00:07:36.685
And. as I told you.
Nance doesn't know.

119
00:07:37.622 --> 00:07:38.622
But my wife...

120
00:07:39.185 --> 00:07:40.710
she's far from stupid.

121
00:07:40.872 --> 00:07:43.816
Paul. you're going to need
to resist.

122
00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:46.133
For the good of
not only yourself.

123
00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:47.216
but everyone around you.

124
00:07:47.274 --> 00:07:50.762
You have got to stop
this poison from spreading.

125
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:52.806
You're right. Donovan.
You're right.

126
00:07:53.634 --> 00:07:55.215
What a wonderful choice of words

127
00:07:55.298 --> 00:07:57.268
because she is poison
and you know what...

128
00:07:57.782 --> 00:07:59.270
I love drinking her.

129
00:08:00.501 --> 00:08:03.847
Getting fucking loaded on her.
I mean look at me.

130
00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:06.215
Look at me. I mean it's like...

131
00:08:06.298 --> 00:08:08.279
I think she might be able
to blackmail me.

132
00:08:09.493 --> 00:08:10.615
Here's the deal.

133
00:08:10.698 --> 00:08:12.237
Talk to her. Donovan. please.

134
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.286
because you're the only one
that can fix this.

135
00:08:17.214 --> 00:08:19.701
I will make it worth your while.

136
00:08:20.284 --> 00:08:21.284
Name it.

137
00:08:27.976 --> 00:08:29.304
[slow jazz music playing]

138
00:08:32.638 --> 00:08:33.639
I'll stand.

139
00:08:34.756 --> 00:08:35.756
But you're shaking.

140
00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:39.352
I'll get right to the point.

141
00:08:41.773 --> 00:08:42.981
My client. Paul Anderson.

142
00:08:43.484 --> 00:08:44.589
He wants to stop seeing you.

143
00:08:44.672 --> 00:08:46.776
He's afraid if he does.
you'll blackmail him.

144
00:08:47.414 --> 00:08:48.414
[laughs]

145
00:08:49.711 --> 00:08:50.711
I'm a professional.

146
00:08:50.961 --> 00:08:52.843
I would never
actually blackmail anyone.

147
00:08:53.617 --> 00:08:55.851
He gets off on the idea
of it. that's all.

148
00:08:57.234 --> 00:09:00.609
He's free to go
without any consequences at all.

149
00:09:01.414 --> 00:09:03.501
But as long as he pays me
for my services...

150
00:09:04.211 --> 00:09:05.378
I'll give him my best.

151
00:09:05.836 --> 00:09:06.880
Yeah?

152
00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:09.307
You're saying he knows
you wouldn't blackmail him.

153
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:10.484
Of course he does.

154
00:09:10.937 --> 00:09:12.594
He's a rich man
who has everything.

155
00:09:12.932 --> 00:09:14.846
So he pays
for the illusion of danger.

156
00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:16.693
Getting close
to what it'd feel like

157
00:09:16.776 --> 00:09:17.776
to lose everything.

158
00:09:18.166 --> 00:09:19.393
Without ever having to.

159
00:09:20.002 --> 00:09:21.144
It's all a game.

160
00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:23.324
That's a perverse way
of making a living.

161
00:09:23.407 --> 00:09:25.940
[laughing]
You're his life coach. right?

162
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.175
The one who fills him
with all the religious fervor.

163
00:09:29.258 --> 00:09:31.597
I try to lead him
down the path of righteousness.

164
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.822
So do I.

165
00:09:35.703 --> 00:09:36.907
As yourself this.

166
00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:39.453
Are you here...

167
00:09:40.254 --> 00:09:42.902
because you truly care
about his wellbeing?

168
00:09:44.637 --> 00:09:46.211
Or because he paid you
to be here?

169
00:09:52.783 --> 00:09:53.900
What fun you would be.

170
00:10:01.868 --> 00:10:04.104
Yeah. Paul. Donovan here.

171
00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:05.480
I called her. as you asked.

172
00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:07.488
She's something. isn't she?

173
00:10:07.571 --> 00:10:08.608
Yeah. listen Paul.

174
00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:11.160
I think that you seriously
need to tell your wife.

175
00:10:11.934 --> 00:10:14.116
No. Donovan. no.
I already told you

176
00:10:14.199 --> 00:10:16.051
that's not in the cards.

177
00:10:16.754 --> 00:10:19.395
She'd divorce me
and take everything.

178
00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:21.897
No. listen to me.
Whatever you think you have.

179
00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.913
what you're feeling
with this woman. is not real.

180
00:10:23.996 --> 00:10:24.996
It's a game.

181
00:10:25.957 --> 00:10:27.723
Especially the danger.

182
00:10:28.002 --> 00:10:29.015
Alright. now listen.

183
00:10:29.098 --> 00:10:30.999
You could leave her in a minute

184
00:10:31.082 --> 00:10:33.637
and there would be no
repercussions. she told me.

185
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:36.527
-She said that?
-Yeah. she did.

186
00:10:37.488 --> 00:10:38.655
Listen. you...

187
00:10:38.738 --> 00:10:40.160
You pay me for advice. right?

188
00:10:41.224 --> 00:10:43.810
I think what you need to do
is accept that you're an addict.

189
00:10:57.934 --> 00:11:00.535
I think it's great you kept
the place here in New York.

190
00:11:01.074 --> 00:11:04.559
You two enjoying the break
from the LA scene?

191
00:11:05.309 --> 00:11:07.246
But it doesn't feel
like a break anymore.

192
00:11:08.126 --> 00:11:10.587
Brandon here just got offered
the best payday of his career.

193
00:11:11.356 --> 00:11:13.006
Leading role in a comedy.

194
00:11:13.902 --> 00:11:15.341
And he wants to turn it down.

195
00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:16.976
[Tori] Can you believe that?

196
00:11:17.059 --> 00:11:18.858
[Brandon] I've been going
nonstop. alright?

197
00:11:18.941 --> 00:11:21.146
I finally realized.
after so many years

198
00:11:21.229 --> 00:11:22.229
of being poor.

199
00:11:23.057 --> 00:11:24.184
that I'm doing pretty good.

200
00:11:24.408 --> 00:11:27.052
I want to take a break.
Just some time off. you know.

201
00:11:27.135 --> 00:11:28.744
Actually see my wife and kids.

202
00:11:29.471 --> 00:11:30.471
Otherwise...

203
00:11:31.033 --> 00:11:32.609
what's the point
of all this work?

204
00:11:35.968 --> 00:11:38.562
Well family is
what matters most.

205
00:11:38.968 --> 00:11:39.968
Exactly.

206
00:11:41.718 --> 00:11:43.338
Why does it feel like
you don't want to spend time

207
00:11:43.421 --> 00:11:44.421
with me anymore?

208
00:11:45.687 --> 00:11:46.687
Baby.

209
00:11:47.116 --> 00:11:49.023
I want to be able
to tell our kids...

210
00:11:50.204 --> 00:11:53.473
that their father was
the highest-grossing movie star

211
00:11:53.556 --> 00:11:54.579
of all time.

212
00:11:56.189 --> 00:11:58.882
Not that he squandered away
his opportunities.

213
00:11:59.415 --> 00:12:02.055
I mean what kind of example
would that set for our kids?

214
00:12:02.931 --> 00:12:05.816
Alright. let's all take
a deep breath.

215
00:12:16.319 --> 00:12:17.941
I was going on a date
after work.

216
00:12:18.535 --> 00:12:20.238
-So that's why... Yeah.
-Oh yeah?

217
00:12:20.551 --> 00:12:21.551
So...

218
00:12:23.923 --> 00:12:24.923
How'd it go?

219
00:12:26.743 --> 00:12:27.743
It was okay.

220
00:12:29.899 --> 00:12:31.821
What about you?
Are you seeing anybody?

221
00:12:32.718 --> 00:12:34.804
You know.
you never mentioned someone.

222
00:12:40.554 --> 00:12:41.554
Okay...

223
00:12:43.137 --> 00:12:44.636
Thank you all
for coming out tonight.

224
00:12:44.719 --> 00:12:47.429
and let's put our hands together
for the man of the hour.

225
00:12:47.719 --> 00:12:49.307
Mr. Donovan Strathmore.

226
00:12:54.234 --> 00:12:55.437
Thank you.

227
00:12:56.679 --> 00:12:59.054
Thank you. thank you all
very much. I...

228
00:12:59.633 --> 00:13:01.030
I appreciate your being here.

229
00:13:01.797 --> 00:13:04.781
It's been a great deal of time
since we were last together.

230
00:13:05.086 --> 00:13:07.328
And I have to confess.
the reason for that is...

231
00:13:07.625 --> 00:13:09.747
because of the fact
that I've been very busy

232
00:13:10.234 --> 00:13:12.667
working on my new book.
which I'm pleased to say

233
00:13:12.929 --> 00:13:16.045
is going to be released
within five days.

234
00:13:16.287 --> 00:13:18.459
So thank you all
for your support.

235
00:13:18.542 --> 00:13:19.850
[applause]

236
00:13:23.068 --> 00:13:24.822
Every time
we have new people here.

237
00:13:24.905 --> 00:13:26.014
we always acknowledge them.

238
00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:27.890
I see some old faces.

239
00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:29.947
I see a couple new faces.

240
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:32.228
and I want to introduce
a couple people to you.

241
00:13:33.046 --> 00:13:34.046
Brandon

242
00:13:34.397 --> 00:13:35.514
and Tori McGuire.

243
00:13:35.795 --> 00:13:39.694
Brandon and Tori came in from LA
to be with us.

244
00:13:40.092 --> 00:13:43.353
And I know that everybody here
will give us the old welcome.

245
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:46.137
Brandon. I'm very proud
of both of you

246
00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.327
for making the decision

247
00:13:47.525 --> 00:13:49.287
and taking that part
in that new film.

248
00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:51.590
I can speak for each of us
when I say

249
00:13:51.673 --> 00:13:54.395
that we are all going to be
front and center. first row

250
00:13:54.478 --> 00:13:56.586
when you make your premiere
here in New York.

251
00:14:13.468 --> 00:14:15.313
In the time
since our last gathering. I--

252
00:14:15.396 --> 00:14:16.397
I've been...

253
00:14:16.939 --> 00:14:18.596
I've been thinking a lot
about what it means

254
00:14:18.679 --> 00:14:20.193
to be a good person

255
00:14:20.836 --> 00:14:22.781
in this world of temptation.

256
00:14:23.696 --> 00:14:25.815
There are lots of opportunities
for people to go astray

257
00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:27.445
and have
self-injurious behavior.

258
00:14:28.039 --> 00:14:29.461
And for that reason I believe

259
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.629
that it's a matter
of resisting temptation.

260
00:14:33.152 --> 00:14:36.437
The temptation to stray
from the path of righteousness.

261
00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.902
The temptation
of the material world.

262
00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:44.043
Temptation of the flesh.

263
00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:50.436
We must not allow ourselves
to become breasts.

264
00:14:55.538 --> 00:14:56.538
Beasts.

265
00:14:58.898 --> 00:14:59.899
We must...

266
00:15:03.486 --> 00:15:04.486
[Donovan clears throat]

267
00:15:06.734 --> 00:15:08.070
We must not become beasts.

268
00:15:09.344 --> 00:15:11.500
Excuse me. Um. sorry.

269
00:15:14.187 --> 00:15:16.298
We must rise
above the fires of the pit

270
00:15:16.381 --> 00:15:19.350
and transcend the shallow--
the so-called values...

271
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:22.522
of this increasingly
material world.

272
00:15:24.551 --> 00:15:26.309
We must know...

273
00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:28.762
that the serpent
from the garden of Eden

274
00:15:28.845 --> 00:15:30.138
still lives here among us.

275
00:15:30.754 --> 00:15:31.754
Make no mistake.

276
00:15:34.306 --> 00:15:35.598
I think that went well.

277
00:15:35.681 --> 00:15:36.931
There were some donations.

278
00:15:39.423 --> 00:15:42.087
-Thanks.
-Excuse me. Mr. Strathmore.

279
00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:46.516
Could I speak with him briefly
in private if you don't mind.

280
00:15:47.363 --> 00:15:48.918
[assistant] No. not at all.

281
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:51.371
I'll leave you two.

282
00:15:52.645 --> 00:15:53.703
Do your thing.

283
00:15:56.371 --> 00:15:58.406
Thank you
for your message tonight.

284
00:15:58.489 --> 00:16:00.710
I really appreciate all you do.

285
00:16:01.028 --> 00:16:03.202
Oh. really? Thanks.

286
00:16:03.285 --> 00:16:05.173
And thanks for coming.

287
00:16:05.832 --> 00:16:08.426
I was wondering.
do you have dinner plans?

288
00:16:09.723 --> 00:16:10.945
Well actually. I'm...

289
00:16:11.028 --> 00:16:13.556
You put together
such a great program and...

290
00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:16.058
I don't know. I thought
maybe I could take you out.

291
00:16:16.632 --> 00:16:18.811
Treat you to dinner.
Show my appreciation.

292
00:16:23.649 --> 00:16:24.650
Um...

293
00:16:26.025 --> 00:16:27.025
Well this is...

294
00:16:28.174 --> 00:16:30.865
It's a nice place. thank you
for getting the reservation.

295
00:16:31.803 --> 00:16:32.803
Wow.

296
00:16:35.077 --> 00:16:36.078
It's nice.

297
00:16:38.678 --> 00:16:39.678
Seeing you like this.

298
00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:42.960
Outside the realm
of a professional relationship.

299
00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:46.741
Seeing you just as... a man.

300
00:16:49.288 --> 00:16:50.397
I'm always just a man.

301
00:16:50.928 --> 00:16:51.928
You know what I mean.

302
00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:53.512
No. I...

303
00:16:54.141 --> 00:16:55.618
You-- you're so handsome.

304
00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:59.399
The more I look at your face
without a professional barrier.

305
00:17:01.535 --> 00:17:03.012
Thank you. Thank you for the...

306
00:17:04.223 --> 00:17:05.223
for the compliment.

307
00:17:05.942 --> 00:17:07.483
You look unprofessional. too.

308
00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:10.083
Did you know

309
00:17:10.165 --> 00:17:12.412
you're the first man
I've ever bought dinner for?

310
00:17:12.493 --> 00:17:15.034
No. no actually I insist
that I pick up the check.

311
00:17:15.596 --> 00:17:17.915
No. I forbid it.

312
00:17:19.294 --> 00:17:20.583
-I want to do it.
-You sure?

313
00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:22.300
Positively.

314
00:17:24.567 --> 00:17:26.092
You know my place isn't far.

315
00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:27.779
Want to walk me home?

316
00:17:29.818 --> 00:17:32.068
It would be very gentlemanly
of you.

317
00:17:32.795 --> 00:17:34.637
I don't like walking alone
in the dark.

318
00:17:36.653 --> 00:17:37.653
Okay.

319
00:17:44.956 --> 00:17:46.198
[foreboding music]

320
00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:52.777
You... You remind me of him.

321
00:17:55.972 --> 00:17:56.972
My husband.

322
00:18:01.299 --> 00:18:02.299
Um...

323
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:08.291
Have you ever lost someone?

324
00:18:42.768 --> 00:18:43.768
I'm sorry.

325
00:18:45.354 --> 00:18:46.354
I can't do this.

326
00:18:52.651 --> 00:18:55.801
[eerie vocalization]

327
00:19:15.911 --> 00:19:17.154
[Donovan crying]

328
00:19:30.419 --> 00:19:31.661
I KNOW YOUR SECRETS.
DO AS I SAY

329
00:19:31.744 --> 00:19:33.818
OR THE WORLD WILL LEARN
ABOUT THE HYPOCRITICAL ADDICT

330
00:19:33.901 --> 00:19:35.216
WHO COULDN'T TAKE
HIS OWN ADVICE.

331
00:19:37.432 --> 00:19:38.901
[ominous music]

332
00:21:38.914 --> 00:21:42.089
IF YOU DON'T WANT THE WORLD
TO LEARN THE TRUTH ABOUT YOU.

333
00:21:42.172 --> 00:21:43.302
TRANSFER $1.000.000.

334
00:21:54.637 --> 00:21:57.960
THE BANK WON'T ALLOW ME
TO JUST WIRE THAT MUCH AT ONCE.

335
00:21:58.043 --> 00:21:59.317
I'LL NEED SOME TIME

336
00:22:06.034 --> 00:22:07.034
YOU HAVE 72 HOURS.

337
00:22:07.117 --> 00:22:08.653
IF YOU GO TO THE POLICE.
I'LL KNOW.

338
00:22:08.736 --> 00:22:11.455
AND YOUR SECRETS WILL BECOME
PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE IMMEDIATELY.

339
00:22:42.343 --> 00:22:44.029
Why were you
at my event last night?

340
00:22:44.648 --> 00:22:46.490
I was protecting my investment.

341
00:22:47.179 --> 00:22:48.325
Extorting me. you mean?

342
00:22:49.034 --> 00:22:50.867
I'm talking
about our mutual client.

343
00:22:52.195 --> 00:22:53.757
What's this about extortion?

344
00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.833
He was afraid
you were going to blackmail him.

345
00:22:56.452 --> 00:22:59.780
And I told you I would never
actually do that to someone.

346
00:22:59.863 --> 00:23:02.089
[man inside] Goddess Emiliana.
please come back.

347
00:23:02.805 --> 00:23:03.852
Is that him?

348
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:09.471
Somebody hacked my computer
and they're threatening me.

349
00:23:10.034 --> 00:23:11.779
I saw you leave
before the event was over.

350
00:23:11.862 --> 00:23:13.601
You saying that it wasn't you?

351
00:23:14.128 --> 00:23:15.925
That's not my thing.

352
00:23:17.105 --> 00:23:18.564
I choose to work for a living.

353
00:23:19.323 --> 00:23:21.305
After all.
"we must not allow ourselves

354
00:23:21.388 --> 00:23:22.388
"to become breasts."

355
00:23:24.771 --> 00:23:26.155
If you want something else...

356
00:23:26.654 --> 00:23:27.948
make an appointment.

357
00:23:34.824 --> 00:23:36.832
What brings you here today.
Mr. Strathmore?

358
00:23:38.697 --> 00:23:40.424
Uh. I've been...

359
00:23:41.432 --> 00:23:42.546
I've been hacked.

360
00:23:43.135 --> 00:23:45.633
Somebody's trying to scare me
into giving them money.

361
00:23:46.526 --> 00:23:47.526
I see.

362
00:23:48.433 --> 00:23:49.803
Well I'll tell you up front.

363
00:23:50.269 --> 00:23:53.098
you're not the type of client
that usually rolls up in here.

364
00:23:53.557 --> 00:23:54.558
What do you mean?

365
00:23:55.526 --> 00:23:57.667
I worked Internal Affairs
for eight years.

366
00:23:58.206 --> 00:23:59.480
I was good at it.

367
00:23:59.831 --> 00:24:00.831
Too good.

368
00:24:01.269 --> 00:24:03.317
I realized they didn't
really want me to be.

369
00:24:04.026 --> 00:24:05.944
So I started up this firm
to help the people

370
00:24:06.027 --> 00:24:07.196
that can't afford our...

371
00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:08.980
rigged system.

372
00:24:09.737 --> 00:24:10.769
Clearly you can.

373
00:24:11.527 --> 00:24:12.527
That's what I mean.

374
00:24:13.589 --> 00:24:15.217
If you don't want to work
with me. I can just--

375
00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:16.300
Listen.

376
00:24:17.122 --> 00:24:19.291
Any idea who might be trying
to blackmail you?

377
00:24:22.378 --> 00:24:24.129
Could by anybody.
Somebody I met? I--

378
00:24:25.378 --> 00:24:26.761
Let's see. my-- my assistant.

379
00:24:28.065 --> 00:24:31.428
This client
named Marsha Daugherty.

380
00:24:31.511 --> 00:24:34.183
It's D-A-U-G-H-E-R-T-Y.

381
00:24:35.097 --> 00:24:37.855
I saw her on the day
that message came up

382
00:24:37.938 --> 00:24:39.157
on my computer screen.

383
00:24:39.837 --> 00:24:43.173
Then there's this dominatrix
that I had to talk to for work.

384
00:24:44.796 --> 00:24:46.197
Could be a punk hacker

385
00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.369
who's just got too much time
on their hands.

386
00:24:48.452 --> 00:24:51.069
I just. I can't rack my brain.
I just don't know.

387
00:24:51.398 --> 00:24:53.588
Alright. what about anybody
from your past

388
00:24:53.671 --> 00:24:54.910
that might have a grudge?

389
00:24:55.249 --> 00:24:56.249
Ex-lover?

390
00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:00.256
Yeah. there is one.

391
00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:05.004
Now look. this is
totally confidential. right.

392
00:25:05.709 --> 00:25:08.173
Any private investigator
who can't keep a secret...

393
00:25:08.256 --> 00:25:10.092
is a private investigator
without work.

394
00:25:10.756 --> 00:25:12.201
And I know your money's green.

395
00:25:14.045 --> 00:25:15.045
Alright.

396
00:25:16.502 --> 00:25:17.558
So there's this woman.

397
00:25:18.486 --> 00:25:20.352
But I haven't heard from her
in decades.

398
00:25:22.525 --> 00:25:23.772
Can you tell me her name?

399
00:25:24.017 --> 00:25:26.235
Of course. It's Maureen...

400
00:25:27.727 --> 00:25:30.094
Nyman. N-Y-M-A-N.

401
00:25:34.842 --> 00:25:36.319
She'd be about my age now.

402
00:25:38.413 --> 00:25:41.048
Look. I only have a couple days
to solve this. so I...

403
00:25:41.131 --> 00:25:42.975
Alright. I'll do my best.

404
00:25:43.889 --> 00:25:44.975
But full disclosure.

405
00:25:45.873 --> 00:25:48.006
that's nearly an impossible
turnaround time.

406
00:25:48.709 --> 00:25:49.709
No guarantees.

407
00:25:53.334 --> 00:25:54.600
Alright.

408
00:25:56.982 --> 00:25:58.451
Now let's talk fees.

[phone vibrating]

410
00:26:16.786 --> 00:26:17.786
Hello?

411
00:26:18.443 --> 00:26:19.985
-[PI] Mr. Strathmore.
-Yeah.

412
00:26:20.068 --> 00:26:21.575
-This is Rod Fitzgerald.
-Okay.

413
00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:25.857
Still working on a few angles.
but there's one that went cold.

414
00:26:26.521 --> 00:26:27.521
Maureen Nyman...

415
00:26:28.279 --> 00:26:30.247
She died about two years ago.

416
00:26:31.365 --> 00:26:32.365
Overdose.

417
00:26:33.324 --> 00:26:35.010
I'll stay in touch
with any updates.

418
00:26:35.886 --> 00:26:36.886
Sure.

[no audible dialogue]

423
00:28:32.044 --> 00:28:34.171
I got something
I want you to take a look at.

424
00:28:37.493 --> 00:28:39.676
From the security cameras
at the event.

425
00:28:39.875 --> 00:28:42.846
Had to pull a few strings
with my friends at the precinct.

426
00:28:44.594 --> 00:28:47.513
Looks like this young lady
snuck into your dressing room.

427
00:28:47.596 --> 00:28:49.519
Probably messed
with your computer there.

428
00:28:50.573 --> 00:28:51.682
Do you recognize her?

429
00:28:55.251 --> 00:28:56.719
Your ex. Maureen...

430
00:28:57.391 --> 00:28:59.876
had a daughter in '89
named Evelyn Nyman.

431
00:29:01.196 --> 00:29:03.700
The father was a fellow
by the name of David Schmidt.

432
00:29:04.577 --> 00:29:05.911
Pulled her bank statements.

433
00:29:06.609 --> 00:29:08.705
She took a trip recently
here to the city.

434
00:29:09.476 --> 00:29:11.804
Positive match on her ID
in those photos.

435
00:29:14.743 --> 00:29:17.005
Any reason she'd have a grudge
against you?

436
00:29:19.618 --> 00:29:20.618
No.

437
00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:28.058
Can I keep these?

438
00:29:31.072 --> 00:29:34.314
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

439
00:29:51.295 --> 00:29:54.960
I'LL SEND YOU THE MONEY.

440
00:29:57.801 --> 00:29:58.839
He's going to do it.

441
00:30:05.393 --> 00:30:06.430
[chuckles]

442
00:30:14.095 --> 00:30:15.454
[polite applause]

443
00:30:18.507 --> 00:30:20.002
I've had the chance
to read the book.

444
00:30:20.085 --> 00:30:21.921
It's one hell of a story.

445
00:30:22.241 --> 00:30:24.990
Thanks. Connie. That means a lot
coming from you. Thank you.

446
00:30:25.324 --> 00:30:26.860
Would you care to give
some of those

447
00:30:26.943 --> 00:30:28.660
who might be unfamiliar
a little background.

448
00:30:28.743 --> 00:30:29.888
Sure. well...

449
00:30:30.412 --> 00:30:31.413
You know. Connie.

450
00:30:31.496 --> 00:30:33.206
once you get
to a certain point in life.

451
00:30:33.646 --> 00:30:36.793
You start to think about
how you got to where you are.

452
00:30:38.128 --> 00:30:39.750
Everyday I deal
with some powerful

453
00:30:39.833 --> 00:30:41.417
and well-known people. right?

454
00:30:42.136 --> 00:30:45.537
And if you had told me.
when I was young.

455
00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:47.467
that I would be doing this
for my job.

456
00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:49.933
I would've thought
that you were joking.

457
00:30:50.839 --> 00:30:53.279
So there were reports
that came out recently

458
00:30:53.362 --> 00:30:55.270
that claimed to prove
a very different...

459
00:30:55.839 --> 00:30:57.151
story about your history.

460
00:30:57.495 --> 00:30:58.607
Are you aware of that?

461
00:30:59.733 --> 00:31:00.764
First I've heard of it.

462
00:31:00.847 --> 00:31:03.111
They were leaked very recently.
These reports...

463
00:31:04.558 --> 00:31:05.558
They claim...

464
00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.315
that you actually
spent some time in prison.

465
00:31:09.901 --> 00:31:11.678
And that you had an--

466
00:31:11.761 --> 00:31:14.276
No. no these were not...

467
00:31:14.714 --> 00:31:16.628

of questions.

Let's get back to

469
00:31:20.315 --> 00:31:22.823
Would you care
to set the record straight?

470

Mr. Strathmore.
I have the reports right here.

471
00:31:26.698 --> 00:31:29.346

-Call the car.
-Already on it. sir.

in our list of questions.

Let's get back to
the-- this is...

477
00:31:49.751 --> 00:31:52.290
Would you care
to set the record straight?

I have the reports right here.

ABOUT THIS GUY?

with how that interview went.

502
00:33:27.124 --> 00:33:29.697
They've printed out
a lot of copies.

503
00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:31.801
which means
it's a big investment for them.

504
00:33:32.093 --> 00:33:33.096
They want to be sure

505
00:33:33.179 --> 00:33:35.096
before they go on
with any more publicity.

506
00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:37.549
It's about the sales.
I'm sure you understand.

507
00:33:37.632 --> 00:33:39.559
Well. I'm sure everything
will blow over.

508

Donovan Strathmore. a life coach
to the rich and famous.

514
00:34:08.335 --> 00:34:11.018
has just been exposed
by an anonymous source

515
00:34:11.101 --> 00:34:14.322
as a man leading a life
very different

516
00:34:14.405 --> 00:34:16.096
from the advice he dishes out

517
00:34:16.601 --> 00:34:18.010
at a book signing recently.

518
00:34:18.092 --> 00:34:20.416
He was asked
about some of these allegations

519
00:34:20.498 --> 00:34:22.569
and unable to conjure up
any defense.

520
00:34:23.187 --> 00:34:24.228
He just walked out.

00:34:25.601 --> 00:34:28.065
I don't know
if you've seen the video.

522
00:34:29.312 --> 00:34:31.027
It's something
to check out. Look...

523
00:34:31.444 --> 00:34:32.471
We've since learned

524
00:34:32.554 --> 00:34:34.239
his actual name
is David Schmidt.

525
00:34:34.322 --> 00:34:36.291
He's a recovering alcoholic
and drug addict

526
00:34:36.373 --> 00:34:38.143
with a very checkered past.

00:34:38.226 --> 00:34:41.246
Including a DUI.
where he hit a child pedestrian

528
00:34:41.929 --> 00:34:44.085
who is now wheelchair-bound
for life.

529
00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:47.440

for public personalities

530
00:34:47.523 --> 00:34:49.181
change their names
to protect their privacy.

531
00:34:49.264 --> 00:34:53.181
However this guy has been
covering up lots more than that.

532
00:34:53.264 --> 00:34:55.908
He was arrested for distributing
illegal substances

533
00:34:55.991 --> 00:34:58.796
just a few years
after the accident.

534
00:34:58.879 --> 00:34:59.892
Didn't learn his lesson.

535
00:34:59.975 --> 00:35:01.798
Then he spent some
time behind bars.

536
00:35:01.881 --> 00:35:04.060
Strathmore's book
touches on none of this.

537
00:35:04.143 --> 00:35:06.365
In fact. it appears
to be offering

538
00:35:06.448 --> 00:35:09.057
a completely revised history.

539
00:35:09.378 --> 00:35:11.307
-I got your message.
-What do you want?

540
00:35:13.022 --> 00:35:16.326
-Where'd you find that video?
-That's just one of many.

541
00:35:16.409 --> 00:35:17.699
They're all over the place.

542
00:35:18.951 --> 00:35:21.202
Look. I'd really rather
not hear from you again.

543
00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:29.257
Here's an interview
with Strathmore's assistant.

544
00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:32.801
I've been his assistant
for two years.

545
00:35:34.746 --> 00:35:36.207
I used to admire him.

546
00:35:36.597 --> 00:35:38.639
But I guess it just
makes you question

547
00:35:38.722 --> 00:35:40.410
if you ever
really know somebody.

548
00:35:41.613 --> 00:35:42.785
I need you to punish me.

549
00:35:48.621 --> 00:35:50.690
[leather thwacks]
Tell me you're a sick man.

550
00:35:51.653 --> 00:35:53.113
-Say it. David.
-I'm a...

551
00:35:54.246 --> 00:35:55.330
I'm a sick man.

552
00:35:56.073 --> 00:35:57.377
Tell me you're a hypocrite.

553
00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.190
I'm a hypocrite.

554
00:36:15.892 --> 00:36:17.592
[different accent] I'm happy
you came back to see me.

555
00:36:20.283 --> 00:36:21.283
Your voice...

556
00:36:22.689 --> 00:36:23.689
Your name.

557
00:36:28.059 --> 00:36:30.063
I'm sorry I accused you
of hacking me. I...

558
00:36:31.356 --> 00:36:33.491
The more I thought about it
the more I realized.

559
00:36:33.574 --> 00:36:36.574
I went to your event
because Paul invited me to.

560
00:36:37.848 --> 00:36:40.073
He said he wanted to see
if he could resist me.

561
00:36:43.574 --> 00:36:45.309
As I was leaving. I saw a girl.

562
00:36:45.559 --> 00:36:46.955
Wearing gloves. walking out.

563
00:36:47.488 --> 00:36:50.801
Thought maybe she was catering
at first. or something.

564
00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:55.505
Did you ever find out
who blackmailed you?

565
00:36:58.931 --> 00:36:59.931
Was it her?

566
00:37:04.742 --> 00:37:06.725
Been seeing your name around
a lot lately.

567
00:37:08.381 --> 00:37:10.201
You're becoming
a regular pariah.

568
00:37:15.224 --> 00:37:17.962
They say it's never too late
to choose to be a good man.

569
00:37:19.938 --> 00:37:20.938
I believe that.

570
00:37:23.493 --> 00:37:25.452
You know what I see
when I look at you?

571
00:37:27.407 --> 00:37:29.480
A man who wants to atone
for his sins.

572
00:37:31.596 --> 00:37:33.947
A man who desperately wants
to do the right thing.

573
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:37.255
I think you should be
given a chance.

574
00:37:40.549 --> 00:37:41.549
Nobody else does.

575
00:37:43.135 --> 00:37:44.135
[she sighs]

576
00:37:44.877 --> 00:37:46.869
People are so ready
to assume the worst.

577
00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:50.282
They have a rabid appetite
to destroy anyone

578
00:37:50.365 --> 00:37:51.644
with any sort of platform.

579
00:37:52.061 --> 00:37:53.730
Especially those
they disagree with.

580
00:37:54.557 --> 00:37:57.627
It's sometimes justice.
but it's always theater.

581
00:37:59.721 --> 00:38:01.955
Heroes and villains.
black and white.

582
00:38:02.879 --> 00:38:03.907
Good and evil.

583
00:38:04.872 --> 00:38:06.723
The mind of the masses
is a simple one.

584
00:38:09.942 --> 00:38:11.831
The world could use
a little tenderness.

585
00:38:13.458 --> 00:38:15.468
I'm not going to charge you
for the session.

586
00:38:15.551 --> 00:38:16.586
It was my pleasure.

587
00:38:18.645 --> 00:38:19.645
Strange.

588
00:38:21.614 --> 00:38:23.067
Here. now...

589
00:38:25.136 --> 00:38:26.679
I'm experiencing
the only kindness

590
00:38:26.762 --> 00:38:27.966
that I might have for...

591
00:38:31.942 --> 00:38:33.186
maybe the rest of my life.

592
00:38:35.074 --> 00:38:36.074
[laughs]

593
00:38:37.598 --> 00:38:39.746
-Thank you.
-Always remember...

594
00:38:40.988 --> 00:38:42.529
People are never just one thing.

595
00:38:45.097 --> 00:38:46.324
I'll go grab you a towel.

596
00:39:02.084 --> 00:39:04.001
Look don't tell me
to try and calm down.

597
00:39:04.084 --> 00:39:05.845
I'm trying to explain this
to you. I've been hacked.

598
00:39:05.928 --> 00:39:08.197
I want to make sure
you cancel everything.

599
00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.959
The credit cards.
everything. hold--

600
00:39:10.866 --> 00:39:13.584
Excuse me. I have a call.
Hold on please. do not...

601
00:39:14.053 --> 00:39:15.053
get off the phone.

602
00:39:15.663 --> 00:39:16.663
Yeah.

603
00:39:18.481 --> 00:39:19.509
Yes?

604
00:39:19.592 --> 00:39:21.799
Why didn't you tell me
you were Evelyn's father?

605
00:39:21.882 --> 00:39:23.117
That you changed your name?

606
00:39:23.624 --> 00:39:24.895
You left out a crucial detail

607
00:39:24.978 --> 00:39:26.593
that could've helped
the investigation.

608
00:39:29.437 --> 00:39:30.535
Doesn't matter anymore.

609
00:39:31.531 --> 00:39:32.531
I guess it doesn't.

610
00:39:34.398 --> 00:39:36.343
Your daughter.
she lives in Wisconsin.

611
00:39:37.718 --> 00:39:40.076
If you want to ask her
for your money back or something

612
00:39:40.159 --> 00:39:41.713
I can tell you where she works.

613
00:41:26.812 --> 00:41:27.922
[no audible dialogue]

614
00:41:54.846 --> 00:41:56.096
What the fuck
are you doing here.

615
00:41:56.179 --> 00:41:57.265
you sick fuck?

616
00:41:59.906 --> 00:42:00.953
I know it was you.

617
00:42:02.603 --> 00:42:04.282
You promised me you wouldn't
give out that information

618
00:42:04.365 --> 00:42:05.365
if I gave you what you wanted.

619
00:42:05.873 --> 00:42:08.216
Yeah? Well promises. promises.

620
00:42:09.224 --> 00:42:11.294
What'd you do when you found out
you knocked up my mom?

621
00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:13.130
You ran off.

622
00:42:14.677 --> 00:42:17.257
Do you know she lost
all her friends because of that?

623
00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:20.011
Everyone saw her as a burden
and didn't want to help her.

624
00:42:21.418 --> 00:42:24.027
She did nothing wrong.
but love your sorry fucking ass.

625
00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:26.199
And she paid a terrible price
for it.

626
00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:29.741
And she couldn't forget you
because seeing me everyday

627
00:42:29.824 --> 00:42:31.223
made that impossible for her.

628
00:42:33.473 --> 00:42:35.051
No. now you know what it's like

629
00:42:35.332 --> 00:42:36.488
to feel untouchable.

630
00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:40.920
Can we-- can we go somewhere
to talk?

631
00:42:41.350 --> 00:42:42.860
-I just want to talk.
-Oh my God.

632
00:42:42.943 --> 00:42:44.509
I didn't invite you here. dude.

633
00:42:44.592 --> 00:42:46.230
I don't want
to fucking talk to you.

634
00:42:47.131 --> 00:42:48.329
I don't owe you anything.

635
00:42:48.412 --> 00:42:50.415
I don't owe it to you
to hear your sob story

636
00:42:50.498 --> 00:42:51.944
and cleanse you of your guilt.

637
00:42:53.743 --> 00:42:56.227
You are feeling exactly
how you should be feeling.

638
00:42:58.658 --> 00:43:00.286
You made a big mistake
coming here.

639
00:43:01.486 --> 00:43:02.560
Get the fuck away from me

640
00:43:02.643 --> 00:43:03.778
before I call the bouncers
on your ass

641
00:43:03.861 --> 00:43:05.291
and issue a restraining order.

642
00:43:07.775 --> 00:43:08.775
Okay.

643
00:43:10.017 --> 00:43:11.017
I'll go.

644
00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:13.040
I'm waiting.

645
00:43:21.269 --> 00:43:22.269
[thoughtful music]

646
00:43:53.233 --> 00:43:54.465
You've got five minutes.

647
00:43:55.372 --> 00:43:56.372
Follow my car.

648
00:43:59.544 --> 00:44:00.544
[background chatter]

649
00:44:04.818 --> 00:44:06.931
Out of all the names
you could've picked...

650
00:44:07.014 --> 00:44:09.605
where the fuck did you come up
with Donovan Strathmore?

651
00:44:10.873 --> 00:44:13.401
You're telling me you don't have
a stage name at work?

652
00:44:13.619 --> 00:44:14.944
[waitress]
Can I get you anything?

653
00:44:15.525 --> 00:44:16.736
-Coffee.
-Coffee.

654
00:44:17.072 --> 00:44:19.634
-Two coffees. Anything else?
-No. thanks.

655
00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:23.661
So.

656
00:44:24.422 --> 00:44:25.508
You tracked me down.

657
00:44:28.804 --> 00:44:30.750
Came all the way here.

658
00:44:32.359 --> 00:44:34.088
What were you expecting
would happen?

659
00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:36.636
I just wanted to see you.

660
00:44:36.719 --> 00:44:37.870
You're not getting
the money back.

661
00:44:37.953 --> 00:44:39.906
It's not a--
It's not about the money.

662
00:44:40.898 --> 00:44:42.667
-Look. I'm sorry--
-Everything you thought--

663
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:44.909
You thought you could make
some kind of comeback story

664
00:44:44.992 --> 00:44:45.992
for yourself.

665
00:44:46.515 --> 00:44:48.479
The reformed man. born again.

666
00:44:48.562 --> 00:44:50.386
with a shitty new name
by the way.

667
00:44:50.469 --> 00:44:51.939
handing out overpriced advice.

668
00:44:52.414 --> 00:44:53.750
-I help people.
-Oh.

669
00:44:54.414 --> 00:44:56.164
Have you? Only the rich.

670
00:44:56.789 --> 00:44:58.154
That's not very Christ-like.

671
00:44:58.648 --> 00:45:00.197
Everyone's equal
in the eyes of the Lord.

672
00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:01.844
But not in your eyes.

673
00:45:02.719 --> 00:45:04.562
They have to be able
to afford you

674
00:45:05.125 --> 00:45:06.445
to get your services.

675
00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:08.581
Look around.

676
00:45:09.976 --> 00:45:12.789
Have you ever helped anyone
who truly needed it?

677
00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:16.214
That's what I thought.

678
00:45:17.539 --> 00:45:19.164
Maybe all this money
you're making.

679
00:45:19.247 --> 00:45:21.770
maybe that's your new drug.
your new high.

680
00:45:22.672 --> 00:45:23.672
Think about it.

681
00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:26.320
Anything else?

682
00:45:28.297 --> 00:45:29.922
This is great. thank you.

683
00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:37.744
So really. all I get
is five minutes?

684
00:45:38.353 --> 00:45:39.822
Yeah. We're on the clock.

685
00:45:40.564 --> 00:45:41.822
Like one of your sessions.

686
00:45:42.767 --> 00:45:43.824
It's already been two.

687
00:45:46.843 --> 00:45:47.995
I was hoping to maybe...

688
00:45:48.843 --> 00:45:51.093
find a way to make things right
with you.

689
00:45:51.765 --> 00:45:52.765
[she laughs]

690
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:54.030
Oh shit.

691
00:45:57.536 --> 00:45:59.341
We are way past that point. man.

692
00:46:00.091 --> 00:46:01.875
I mean did you ever read
any of the letters

693
00:46:01.958 --> 00:46:03.029
I sent you growing up.

694
00:46:03.552 --> 00:46:04.927
I sent so many.

695
00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:07.685
And I never got one response.

696
00:46:08.047 --> 00:46:09.047
Not one.

697
00:46:10.734 --> 00:46:11.734
You know. Mom...

698
00:46:12.561 --> 00:46:14.019
Mom was furious
when she found out

699
00:46:14.102 --> 00:46:15.189
I'd been writing you.

700
00:46:16.539 --> 00:46:19.187
I'd found your address.
Written it down somewhere.

701
00:46:24.369 --> 00:46:25.783
I still have all the letters.

702
00:46:26.955 --> 00:46:27.955
All of them.

703
00:46:35.446 --> 00:46:37.712
So what made you come up with
this scheme to get the money.

704
00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:43.843
Heaven helps us cope
with knowing we're going to die.

705
00:46:44.701 --> 00:46:45.873
The American dream...

706
00:46:46.857 --> 00:46:49.571
helps us think that
all our hard work and suffering

707
00:46:49.654 --> 00:46:51.181
will pay off once we're rich

708
00:46:51.264 --> 00:46:52.787
and join the elites.

709
00:46:53.974 --> 00:46:56.639
I've got not time for bullshit
bedtime stories. old man.

710
00:47:01.482 --> 00:47:02.482
Your time's up.

711
00:47:05.412 --> 00:47:06.884
I'm staying at the motel
down the street

712
00:47:06.967 --> 00:47:08.117
if you want to see me again.

713
00:47:08.412 --> 00:47:09.451
Room 108.

714
00:47:15.712 --> 00:47:16.712
That's my daughter.

715
00:48:26.363 --> 00:48:27.363
You snore.

716
00:48:29.082 --> 00:48:30.241
How did you get in here?

717
00:48:32.371 --> 00:48:34.778
Computers aren't the only thing
I can break into.

718
00:48:34.861 --> 00:48:36.122
I didn't think you'd come.

719
00:48:37.033 --> 00:48:38.799
I'm the embodiment of your sins.

720
00:48:40.556 --> 00:48:42.549
I'm starting to enjoy
making you squirm.

721
00:48:47.689 --> 00:48:48.689
Let me...

722
00:48:53.072 --> 00:48:54.348
Let me show you something.

723
00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:12.158
MY HOUSE

724
00:49:17.879 --> 00:49:19.415
I'm sorry
I didn't give you that.

725
00:49:32.619 --> 00:49:33.619
You asked why.

726
00:49:34.401 --> 00:49:35.401
The money.

727
00:49:36.822 --> 00:49:38.908
God. life
is so fucking hard. man.

728
00:49:40.049 --> 00:49:41.486
Mom and I never had much.

729
00:49:42.306 --> 00:49:43.634
She never stopped using.

730
00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:50.196
Now I have
a one-year-old daughter.

731
00:49:51.017 --> 00:49:52.040
Her name's Maureen.

732
00:49:53.275 --> 00:49:54.290
Named after my mom.

733
00:49:56.377 --> 00:49:57.377
Where is she?

734
00:50:00.322 --> 00:50:01.322
With her dad.

735
00:50:05.044 --> 00:50:06.917
You know if you needed money
you could have asked me.

736
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.297
I would've given it to you.

737
00:50:11.867 --> 00:50:13.909
You ignored me my entire life.

738
00:50:14.823 --> 00:50:17.139
Why would I think
that you would suddenly change?

739
00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:20.690
Who's the father.

740
00:50:21.088 --> 00:50:23.243
My fiancé. Adam.

741
00:50:24.462 --> 00:50:27.063
This whole thing was actually
part his idea.

742
00:50:28.173 --> 00:50:30.444
We needed a way
to keep food on the table. okay?

743
00:50:31.827 --> 00:50:34.080
We thought with enough money
that we could...

744
00:50:34.163 --> 00:50:37.694
finally live free. and simple.
and move west where it's warm.

745
00:50:40.328 --> 00:50:41.328
Have a small wedding.

746
00:50:42.758 --> 00:50:44.648
And give Maury
a comfortable childhood.

747
00:50:47.305 --> 00:50:48.305
When are you moving?

748
00:50:50.808 --> 00:50:52.511
I don't know.
a few months maybe.

749
00:50:53.004 --> 00:50:54.160
Tie up some loose ends.

750
00:50:58.207 --> 00:50:59.207
I. um...

751
00:51:01.135 --> 00:51:03.060
I appreciate you telling me
that I'm a...

752
00:51:04.096 --> 00:51:05.096
a grandfather.

753
00:51:05.393 --> 00:51:06.978
I know you could've
left that out.

754
00:51:08.424 --> 00:51:09.424
Yeah. well...

755
00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:11.713
I appreciate
you keeping my letters.

756
00:51:12.987 --> 00:51:15.349
But I also fucking hate you
for never writing me back.

757
00:51:15.432 --> 00:51:16.432
I understand.

758
00:51:21.154 --> 00:51:22.154
Look. um...

759
00:51:26.125 --> 00:51:27.751
I wonder
if I can meet your family.

760
00:51:30.396 --> 00:51:31.396
I don't think so.

761
00:51:34.258 --> 00:51:36.719
Adam doesn't know you're here.
It's not a good idea.

762
00:51:36.802 --> 00:51:37.802
Why?

763
00:51:37.885 --> 00:51:39.758
He'd think that you
just want your money back.

764
00:51:39.841 --> 00:51:41.860
And I'm not entirely sure
it's not why you're here either.

765
00:51:41.943 --> 00:51:43.688
No. it's not about the money.
It's about trying--

766
00:51:43.771 --> 00:51:45.490
No. I told you no sob story.

767
00:51:47.084 --> 00:51:48.607
Oh God. I've got to go.

768
00:51:49.052 --> 00:51:50.052
Will I see you again?

769
00:51:53.239 --> 00:51:54.864
-I have another key.
-I don't care.

770
00:52:20.101 --> 00:52:21.101
[car ignition]

771
00:52:51.176 --> 00:52:53.045
[muffled country music
playing in store]

772
00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:20.030
God bless you.

773
00:53:21.365 --> 00:53:24.187
You know there's some breakfast
at this place that I'm staying.

774
00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:26.637
-I could bring you some.
-Eat shit.

775
00:53:34.378 --> 00:53:38.507
VACANCY

776
00:53:40.839 --> 00:53:41.839
[latch turning]

777
00:53:45.347 --> 00:53:46.598
Why are you on your knees?

778
00:53:49.531 --> 00:53:50.853
-I'm praying.
-Oh.

779
00:53:51.257 --> 00:53:52.562
That's what it is. okay.

780
00:53:53.063 --> 00:53:54.666
Because from here
it kind of looks

781
00:53:54.749 --> 00:53:56.233
like you're blowing
the Holy Spirit.

782
00:53:56.632 --> 00:53:59.367
Which is a little homoerotic
for Christianity. no?

783
00:54:00.882 --> 00:54:03.073
Why do you feel the need
to criticize my faith?

784
00:54:19.667 --> 00:54:20.776
Did you do Twelve Step?

785
00:54:22.775 --> 00:54:23.775
Yeah.

786
00:54:24.618 --> 00:54:25.804
Someone force you to go?

787
00:54:27.384 --> 00:54:28.384
No.

788
00:54:31.679 --> 00:54:33.515
And in recovery
is where you found God?

789
00:54:38.093 --> 00:54:39.526
I didn't have a moral compass.

790
00:54:41.624 --> 00:54:43.530
Didn't worship anything
but my next high.

791
00:54:45.234 --> 00:54:46.234
Drugs.

792
00:54:47.015 --> 00:54:48.273
alcohol. sex. all of it.

793
00:54:57.298 --> 00:54:58.923
You took the initiative.

794
00:55:00.243 --> 00:55:01.299
To save yourself

795
00:55:01.382 --> 00:55:02.966
when you committed
to Twelve Step.

796
00:55:04.007 --> 00:55:08.101
The truth of God didn't do that
for you. you did.

797
00:55:08.722 --> 00:55:09.750
Because deep down.

798
00:55:09.833 --> 00:55:11.976
you actually did know
right from wrong.

799
00:55:13.374 --> 00:55:16.666
I don't care what belief system
you latched onto in recovery.

800
00:55:16.749 --> 00:55:18.273
That doesn't deserve the credit.

801
00:55:18.663 --> 00:55:19.663
You do.

802
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:23.393
No. the minute you realize that
you will see

803
00:55:23.476 --> 00:55:25.401
that you are accountable
for what you do.

804
00:55:25.484 --> 00:55:26.609
That you're in control.

805
00:55:26.835 --> 00:55:30.283
You know. Zeus 2.0
didn't predetermine your fate

806
00:55:30.366 --> 00:55:32.346
and engrave it
on a golden scroll

807
00:55:32.429 --> 00:55:34.164
on some white
fucking fluffy cloud.

808
00:55:34.993 --> 00:55:36.208
Help me.

809
00:55:36.291 --> 00:55:39.126
Help me find the verse
where it says.

810
00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:42.657
"The Lord's work is to exonerate
the first-class guilt

811
00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:44.091
"of the ruling class."

812
00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:46.024
What would a stripper
know about God?

813
00:55:46.107 --> 00:55:48.771
A lot more than a fucking junkie
that's for sure.

814
00:55:52.896 --> 00:55:53.896
To those men...

815
00:55:54.818 --> 00:55:56.373
I am a goddess.

816
00:55:57.474 --> 00:55:59.295
They come
to my house of worship.

817
00:55:59.748 --> 00:56:01.400
And they see me in the flesh.

818
00:56:02.609 --> 00:56:05.241
They don't need a go-between guy
like you to take their money

819
00:56:05.324 --> 00:56:06.822
so they can reach their deity.

820
00:56:10.598 --> 00:56:11.598
You know...

821
00:56:12.277 --> 00:56:13.487
I do wonder. though.

822
00:56:15.315 --> 00:56:16.315
As you and I...

823
00:56:17.315 --> 00:56:19.667
the goddess and the holy man...

824
00:56:20.878 --> 00:56:22.314
take our money to the bank...

825
00:56:23.853 --> 00:56:25.157
what are we really?

826
00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:30.040
You took my money.

827
00:56:34.462 --> 00:56:35.462
So.

828
00:56:36.228 --> 00:56:38.562
So was the club
where you met your fiancé?

829
00:56:38.649 --> 00:56:39.649
No.

830
00:56:42.399 --> 00:56:44.651
Why wasn't meeting your daughter
part of your recovery?

831
00:56:44.734 --> 00:56:45.734
It is.

832
00:56:47.766 --> 00:56:48.766
It should've been.

833
00:56:55.050 --> 00:56:56.455
I buried the man that I was.

834
00:56:57.785 --> 00:56:59.799
I buried everything about him.

835
00:57:01.244 --> 00:57:02.408
You and your mom.

836
00:57:05.947 --> 00:57:07.627
I denied myself
any pleasure. I...

837
00:57:11.678 --> 00:57:14.411
I punished myself with sobriety.
So that I don't go back--

838
00:57:14.494 --> 00:57:16.763
Do you think
all of your self-punishing

839
00:57:16.846 --> 00:57:18.228
somehow makes me feel better?

840
00:57:19.196 --> 00:57:20.200
I help people--

841
00:57:20.283 --> 00:57:22.981
I use what has helped me
to help other people.

842
00:57:23.064 --> 00:57:24.270
Do you understand?

843
00:57:24.353 --> 00:57:26.439
What the fuck
kind of rationality is that?

844
00:57:32.855 --> 00:57:33.855
Look at me.

845
00:57:37.707 --> 00:57:40.233
Do you think I asked you
because I gave a shit

846
00:57:40.316 --> 00:57:41.316
about the answer?

847
00:57:45.113 --> 00:57:46.113
I said look at me.

848
00:57:50.983 --> 00:57:52.030
You need to say it.

849
00:57:53.014 --> 00:57:54.014
Out loud.

850
00:57:54.319 --> 00:57:55.319
Not for me.

851
00:57:57.005 --> 00:57:58.005
For yourself.

852
00:57:59.950 --> 00:58:00.950
Right now.

853
00:58:13.238 --> 00:58:14.238
I felt...

854
00:58:17.212 --> 00:58:18.212
that if I had...

855
00:58:19.072 --> 00:58:20.072
contacted you...

856
00:58:22.025 --> 00:58:24.084
that it would've made
our relationship real.

857
00:58:25.752 --> 00:58:28.005
That I would've started
something that I couldn't...

858
00:58:28.609 --> 00:58:29.609
maintain.

859
00:58:31.687 --> 00:58:33.203
I hurt so many people.

860
00:58:34.553 --> 00:58:36.430
I didn't want to make
the same mistake with you.

861
00:58:36.813 --> 00:58:37.813
So I ran.

862
00:58:43.689 --> 00:58:45.189
It was selfish. and I'm...

863
00:58:47.056 --> 00:58:48.181
I am truly...

864
00:58:49.306 --> 00:58:50.306
sorry.

865
00:58:56.796 --> 00:58:58.785
How long are you planning
on staying here?

866
00:59:00.029 --> 00:59:01.326
How long do you want me to?

they're nice.

But the truth is...

869
00:59:08.435 --> 00:59:09.505
I don't want you here.

870
00:59:10.443 --> 00:59:12.216
I want you gone. Yesterday.

I could've gained from this

That ship sailed
a long time ago. buddy.

873
00:59:23.276 --> 00:59:25.346
I'll leave if you want me to.
okay. but...

874
00:59:27.831 --> 00:59:29.065
Let me ask you something.

875
00:59:38.727 --> 00:59:39.876
Can I see your daughter?

876
00:59:44.134 --> 00:59:45.134
I'll think about it.

Hi. It's a nice place.

893
01:02:14.794 --> 01:02:16.911
Thanks. I've got to put her down
for a nap.

894
01:02:17.888 --> 01:02:18.888
Okay.

895

GERARD UTILITY
ADAM WENSCOMBE

896
01:02:39.441 --> 01:02:40.441
Shit.

897
01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:42.120
Can I help you?

898
01:02:42.792 --> 01:02:43.980
No. I've got it.

899
01:02:45.316 --> 01:02:47.806
Do you have a vase that
I could put these flowers in?

900
01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:49.401
Yeah. check on top
of the fridge.

901
01:02:49.484 --> 01:02:51.101
There should be something
up there.

902
01:02:53.416 --> 01:02:54.416
This'll work.

903
01:03:02.989 --> 01:03:04.379
So that picture...

904
01:03:05.354 --> 01:03:06.950
in the hall of your mother
and me.

905
01:03:07.815 --> 01:03:09.286
Did you get that from your ma?

906
01:03:10.354 --> 01:03:11.997
Where else would it
have come from?

907
01:03:15.743 --> 01:03:17.711
It was taken
just before she got pregnant.

908
01:03:19.274 --> 01:03:20.618
We were trying to get clean.

909
01:03:21.564 --> 01:03:23.383
We weren't doing a very good job
of it.

910
01:03:24.882 --> 01:03:25.882
We fantasized...

911
01:03:26.344 --> 01:03:28.479
about getting married
and that we'd start this--

912
01:03:28.562 --> 01:03:31.080
Start a rehab facility
to help people like you.

913
01:03:31.163 --> 01:03:32.163
Yeah. I heard.

914
01:03:33.796 --> 01:03:36.354
Things don't always work out
the way we want. do they?

915
01:03:40.818 --> 01:03:43.165
I always remember her eyes.
They were so--

916
01:03:43.248 --> 01:03:44.602
They were so sweet and warm.

917
01:03:46.086 --> 01:03:48.946
But even when she smiled.
she still seemed kind of sad.

918
01:03:51.967 --> 01:03:54.456
One time she told me
that I was the love of her life.

919
01:03:54.881 --> 01:03:56.666
-And that if she could--
-Time to eat.

920
01:04:02.770 --> 01:04:03.832
So I was thinking...

921
01:04:04.731 --> 01:04:08.232
If you keep showing signs
of becoming a better person.

922
01:04:08.315 --> 01:04:09.315
truly.

923
01:04:10.502 --> 01:04:12.849
That I'll give you
some of your money back.

924
01:04:12.932 --> 01:04:14.846
In installments. of course.

925
01:04:16.407 --> 01:04:17.407
[door slams]

926
01:04:20.344 --> 01:04:22.359
Finished up a little early
[clears throat].

927
01:04:25.085 --> 01:04:27.189
Didn't realize
we were having company.

928
01:04:27.272 --> 01:04:28.830
Are you hungry. I can get you--

929
01:04:28.913 --> 01:04:30.640
Nope. I got it. All good.

930
01:04:33.124 --> 01:04:34.871
-[chair scrapes on floor]
-[she clears throat]

931
01:04:35.757 --> 01:04:36.842
This is Adam.

932
01:04:38.154 --> 01:04:39.154
-Hey.
-Hey.

933
01:04:48.676 --> 01:04:49.886
Did she show you our baby?

934
01:04:51.137 --> 01:04:52.138
Yeah.

935
01:04:53.614 --> 01:04:55.433
-Beautiful. right?
-Yeah.

936
01:04:55.516 --> 01:04:56.598
She's gorgeous. yeah.

937
01:04:58.157 --> 01:05:00.040
-Mm.
-You two should be very proud.

938
01:05:02.782 --> 01:05:04.887
-So you live here. too.
-No. I live nearby.

939
01:05:05.668 --> 01:05:06.991
But you're here
all the time. babe.

940
01:05:07.074 --> 01:05:10.490
He's here all the time.
and we share bills sometimes.

941
01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:12.965
-Oh. So...
-Yeah.

942
01:05:13.488 --> 01:05:15.078
What do you do
for a living. Adam?

943
01:05:16.262 --> 01:05:17.262
[Adam snorts]

944
01:05:17.574 --> 01:05:18.574
He works on cars.

945
01:05:22.105 --> 01:05:25.840
Yeah. you ever seen her dance?
She's a hell of a dancer.

946
01:05:29.051 --> 01:05:30.051
Yeah.

947
01:05:30.572 --> 01:05:32.713
-She's pretty good.
-Oh yeah.

948
01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:36.244
That where you two met?
At the club?

949
01:05:36.327 --> 01:05:37.327
[inaudible]

950
01:05:38.291 --> 01:05:40.186
-Yeah. it was.
-Do you want some water?

951
01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:41.354
No. I'm fine.

952
01:05:41.437 --> 01:05:43.940
-Honey. I can get you water too.
-No. I'm fine. I'm okay.

953
01:05:44.963 --> 01:05:47.310
I'm actually going
to stop dancing

954
01:05:47.393 --> 01:05:48.486
in like a month or so.

955
01:05:48.963 --> 01:05:52.198
As we get closer to moving...
west. so...

956
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:54.200
Oh yeah.
you must be really excited

957
01:05:54.283 --> 01:05:56.661
to move out there.
to get the hell out of dodge.

958
01:05:56.744 --> 01:05:57.744
Yeah.

959
01:05:59.038 --> 01:06:00.331
Ever been out there. out west?

960
01:06:01.408 --> 01:06:02.408
-Uh-uh.
-No? Oh.

961
01:06:02.783 --> 01:06:05.330
It's beautiful. Oh yeah.
You three...

962
01:06:06.045 --> 01:06:07.046
You'll love it.

963
01:06:13.225 --> 01:06:14.389
Well. um...

964
01:06:16.451 --> 01:06:18.173
I should be going.
This has been really great.

965
01:06:18.256 --> 01:06:20.226
I really thank you
for the dinner. It's...

966
01:06:22.832 --> 01:06:24.046
Thank you. You're--

967
01:06:24.129 --> 01:06:26.562
You're very gracious.
Wonderful meeting your baby

968
01:06:26.645 --> 01:06:27.879
and I'll see you again.

969
01:06:31.614 --> 01:06:32.614
Thank you guys.

970
01:06:40.574 --> 01:06:41.574
[dog barking]

971
01:06:46.377 --> 01:06:47.378
[car ignition starts]

972
01:07:03.436 --> 01:07:04.729
The fuck was he doing here?

973
01:07:06.585 --> 01:07:07.585
Hm?

974
01:07:09.552 --> 01:07:11.099
I heard you when I came in.

975
01:07:12.349 --> 01:07:13.429
Are you seriously thinking

976
01:07:13.512 --> 01:07:15.073
about giving him
some of his money back?

977
01:07:16.651 --> 01:07:20.021
That asshole walked around
like you didn't exist

978
01:07:20.104 --> 01:07:22.038
for your entire life.
Do not forget that.

979
01:07:23.128 --> 01:07:25.706
Hey. what we took.
It's blood money.

980
01:07:27.323 --> 01:07:28.323
Do you understand.

981
01:07:29.794 --> 01:07:31.091
Do you understand?

982
01:07:35.833 --> 01:07:36.833
Come into the house.

983
01:07:43.267 --> 01:07:44.267
[suspenseful music]

984
01:08:16.768 --> 01:08:17.782
[phone vibrates]

985
01:08:18.353 --> 01:08:20.282
-Hello?
-Rod? Rodney?

986
01:08:21.332 --> 01:08:22.823
-Rodney?
-Mr. Strathmore.

987
01:08:23.254 --> 01:08:24.316
Find your daughter?

988
01:08:24.879 --> 01:08:26.136
Yeah. I did.

989
01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:29.858
Hey. can you look
into an Adam Wenscombe?

990
01:08:29.941 --> 01:08:32.148
It's W-E-N-S

991
01:08:32.233 --> 01:08:34.660
C-O-M-B-E.

992
01:08:34.952 --> 01:08:37.697
He's engaged to my daughter.

993
01:08:38.267 --> 01:08:42.645
Sure. In light of your whole
"riches to rags" thing.

994
01:08:42.728 --> 01:08:43.728
it's on the house.

995
01:08:44.361 --> 01:08:45.675
Thanks. I appreciate it.

996
01:08:45.759 --> 01:08:47.246
Call you when I know something.

997
01:08:56.225 --> 01:08:59.147
[phone vibrating]

998
01:09:03.261 --> 01:09:04.754
-Hello?
-Did I wake you?

999
01:09:07.166 --> 01:09:08.246
Doesn't matter.

1000
01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:10.737
So your daughter's fiancé. Adam.

1001
01:09:11.268 --> 01:09:13.282
-Yeah.
-He's real bad news. man.

1002
01:09:13.901 --> 01:09:16.307
I'm no life coach.
but here's my two cents.

1003
01:09:16.987 --> 01:09:18.607
If you care about your daughter.

1004
01:09:18.689 --> 01:09:20.518
I'd intervene in that shit
right quick.

1005
01:09:20.939 --> 01:09:23.760
-What can you tell me about him?
-Been in and out of rehab.

1006
01:09:24.057 --> 01:09:25.671
Possession and dealing.

1007
01:09:25.755 --> 01:09:27.403
A few B&Es. The works.

1008
01:09:27.832 --> 01:09:29.350
Guy's worse on paper than you.

1009
01:09:29.434 --> 01:09:30.434
[suspenseful music]

1010
01:09:37.491 --> 01:09:39.358
[dogs barking]

1011
01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:47.906
[knocking] Evelyn.

1012
01:09:48.296 --> 01:09:50.508
Evelyn. this is Donovan.

1013
01:09:52.350 --> 01:09:53.898
Can I speak to you for a second?

1014
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:03.991
What happened?

1015
01:10:08.754 --> 01:10:09.754
Come in.

1016
01:10:12.902 --> 01:10:13.902
[door slams]

1017
01:10:14.675 --> 01:10:15.675
[lock clicks]

1018
01:10:24.244 --> 01:10:26.180
What the fuck
are you still doing around?

1019
01:10:26.263 --> 01:10:27.557
I couldn't leave you again.

1020
01:10:29.273 --> 01:10:30.273
Now what happened?

1021
01:10:31.985 --> 01:10:32.985
Adam.

1022
01:10:37.436 --> 01:10:39.181
He came by
with some of his friends

1023
01:10:39.264 --> 01:10:40.514
coked out of his mind.

1024
01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:44.421
And he forced me to transfer
the money. all of it.

1025
01:10:46.513 --> 01:10:47.513
[sniffs]

1026
01:10:47.911 --> 01:10:49.412
I thought we were going to go--

1027
01:10:50.388 --> 01:10:51.388
I thought-- [sobs]

1028
01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:56.920
Is...

1029
01:10:57.717 --> 01:10:58.998
Is Maureen alright?

1030
01:11:01.529 --> 01:11:02.529
Yeah? Here.

1031
01:11:04.677 --> 01:11:05.687
Thank you.

1032
01:11:09.952 --> 01:11:11.351
Tell me how I can find him.

1033
01:11:15.858 --> 01:11:17.334
He's probably at his friend's.

1034
01:11:18.733 --> 01:11:21.360
If they haven't left town yet.
they're getting ready to.

1035
01:11:25.379 --> 01:11:26.379
Why would he do this?

1036
01:11:27.028 --> 01:11:28.379
[sighs] Fuck.

1037
01:11:31.065 --> 01:11:32.728
He owed some money
to some people.

1038
01:11:34.112 --> 01:11:36.541
And he promised me
that he would pay them off.

1039
01:11:36.978 --> 01:11:38.635
And then
we'd move west together.

1040
01:11:41.001 --> 01:11:43.341
But he was so mad.

1041
01:11:44.243 --> 01:11:45.907
He was furious.
you know. and he...

1042
01:11:46.892 --> 01:11:48.619
He'd heard me tell you that...

1043
01:11:48.702 --> 01:11:50.764
I wanted to give you
some of the money back.

1044
01:11:58.076 --> 01:11:59.309
Now you listen to me.

1045
01:12:01.809 --> 01:12:03.371
None of this is your fault.

1046
01:12:04.987 --> 01:12:05.987
Okay?

1047
01:12:11.058 --> 01:12:12.464
Tell me where I can find him.

1048
01:12:17.933 --> 01:12:20.335
If he's still in the state.
he's at his friend's.

1049
01:12:22.791 --> 01:12:24.958
-233 Michigan.
-233.

1050
01:12:25.041 --> 01:12:27.861
-It's a green house.
-You and the baby safe here?

1051
01:12:29.018 --> 01:12:31.138
No reason for him
to come back now. is there?

1052
01:12:31.705 --> 01:12:33.057
Well let's hope that's true.

1053
01:12:37.221 --> 01:12:38.478
Okay. look. you stay here.

1054
01:12:40.038 --> 01:12:42.009
You call the cops if you have to

1055
01:12:42.092 --> 01:12:43.967
and I will find a--
Oh and. um...

1056
01:12:45.236 --> 01:12:46.260
Don't open that door.

1057
01:12:46.343 --> 01:12:48.818
You barricade it
with a chair or table. whatever.

1058
01:12:50.882 --> 01:12:52.639
Evelyn. You got it?

1059
01:12:53.875 --> 01:12:55.617
-Yeah.
-Okay.

1060
01:12:59.763 --> 01:13:00.763
[door slams]

1061
01:13:05.771 --> 01:13:06.771
[faint hip-hop beats]

1062
01:13:24.393 --> 01:13:26.206
Guys. I think we need to get...

1063
01:13:27.541 --> 01:13:29.177
we need to hurry this up. okay?

1064
01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:31.949
What's the fucking rush?
We have all these fucking drugs.

1065
01:13:32.956 --> 01:13:35.002
You paid them off. We're rich.

1066
01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:37.038
We can do anything we want.

1067
01:13:37.627 --> 01:13:38.839
We should celebrate.

1068
01:13:38.922 --> 01:13:40.151
Yeah we can celebrate

1069
01:13:40.549 --> 01:13:42.380
when we get maybe
the fuck out of here. alright?

1070
01:13:42.463 --> 01:13:43.463
What is the rush?

1071
01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.175
The fuck are you doing here?

1072
01:13:50.728 --> 01:13:52.181
Getting my daughter back
her money.

1073
01:13:52.572 --> 01:13:54.150
She has your baby
to take care of.

1074
01:13:55.267 --> 01:13:56.267
[laughs]

1075
01:13:56.931 --> 01:13:58.259
Oh that's funny.

1076
01:13:58.861 --> 01:14:00.311
-Coming from you.
-Yeah.

1077
01:14:00.759 --> 01:14:02.442
You beat up an innocent woman.

1078
01:14:02.525 --> 01:14:03.939
Took everything that she has.

1079
01:14:04.541 --> 01:14:06.424
And now
you're about to abandon her?

1080
01:14:07.735 --> 01:14:09.028
You think when you get
where you're going

1081
01:14:09.111 --> 01:14:10.321
you're going to be happy?

1082
01:14:11.025 --> 01:14:12.955
The guilt will eat you up.
I promise you.

1083
01:14:13.594 --> 01:14:15.344
We had plans for that money.

1084
01:14:16.118 --> 01:14:18.538
Hey? Until you came along
and fucked everything up.

1085
01:14:18.621 --> 01:14:20.511
Adam. come on.
Just listen to me please.

1086
01:14:21.246 --> 01:14:22.379
None of this is for me.

1087
01:14:22.959 --> 01:14:25.196
Just give her some of the money
so she can live for a while.

1088
01:14:25.279 --> 01:14:26.963
if you're going to leave her
and Maureen.

1089
01:14:28.216 --> 01:14:29.216
Adam.

1090
01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:32.134
It's never too late
to choose to be a good man.

1091
01:14:32.505 --> 01:14:34.428
[laughs]

1092
01:14:37.924 --> 01:14:39.183
[Adam's friend] Good man?

1093
01:14:39.266 --> 01:14:40.266
[laughter continues]

1094
01:14:41.464 --> 01:14:43.901
It's not too late.
Adam [laughs].

1095
01:14:44.271 --> 01:14:45.646
You really going
to let this old fuck

1096
01:14:45.728 --> 01:14:46.941
tell you what to do. bro?

1097
01:14:49.026 --> 01:14:51.420
The fuck are you waiting for?
Kick his fucking ass.

1098
01:14:51.503 --> 01:14:52.503
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1099
01:14:53.568 --> 01:14:55.116
You need to leave. Right now.

1100
01:14:55.678 --> 01:14:57.243
Not until I get what I came for.

1101
01:14:58.553 --> 01:15:00.556
Don't be such a pussy. Adam.

1102
01:15:00.639 --> 01:15:02.248
Give him
what he fucking came for

1103
01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:04.014
and beat his fucking ass.

1104
01:15:04.097 --> 01:15:05.978
Yeah. don't fucking wait.
Stop standing there.

1105
01:15:06.061 --> 01:15:07.618
Make a fucking move. Adam.

1106
01:15:07.701 --> 01:15:09.764
-Shut up!
-Fucking hit him.

1107
01:15:10.467 --> 01:15:11.467
Hit him!

1108
01:15:12.091 --> 01:15:13.718
Put him
in a fucking wheelchair. Adam.

1109
01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:20.099
You remind me of something.

1110
01:15:21.035 --> 01:15:23.480
-Yeah?
-Yeah. Me when I was younger.

1111
01:15:24.105 --> 01:15:25.896
-Fucking hit him.
-Come on.

1112
01:15:25.978 --> 01:15:27.023
[intense music]

1113
01:15:30.370 --> 01:15:31.370

1114
01:15:33.206 --> 01:15:34.655
[thuds]

1115
01:15:39.504 --> 01:15:40.911
We should hit the road. guys.

1116
01:15:40.994 --> 01:15:42.364
[Donovan gasping]

1117
01:15:45.934 --> 01:15:47.334
Got a long ways ahead of us.

1118
01:15:47.921 --> 01:15:49.225
And who knows

1119
01:15:49.943 --> 01:15:51.514
if Sergeant Badass over here...

1120
01:15:53.468 --> 01:15:54.905
came to call the cops on us.

1121
01:16:02.639 --> 01:16:04.179
-[groans]
-What else you got?

1122
01:16:08.038 --> 01:16:09.038
Thanks.

1123
01:16:09.843 --> 01:16:10.843
Let's go.

1124
01:16:14.519 --> 01:16:16.715
[footsteps]

1125
01:16:41.150 --> 01:16:42.150
[groans]

1126
01:16:47.968 --> 01:16:48.968
[grunts]

1127
01:17:06.395 --> 01:17:07.395
[grunts]

1128
01:17:11.666 --> 01:17:12.666
[groans]

1129
01:17:16.713 --> 01:17:17.800
[high-pitched tone]

1130
01:17:37.903 --> 01:17:39.629
[breathing heavily]

1131
01:17:42.387 --> 01:17:43.387
[groans]

1132
01:17:45.050 --> 01:17:46.520
[knocking at door]

1133
01:17:47.817 --> 01:17:49.348
Evelyn? [coughs]

1134
01:17:50.371 --> 01:17:53.223
Evelyn [knocks]. It's Donovan.

1135
01:17:59.161 --> 01:18:00.161
It's Donovan.

1136
01:18:02.434 --> 01:18:03.661
-Oh my God.
-[groans]

1137
01:18:04.528 --> 01:18:05.940
It's okay.

1138
01:18:16.014 --> 01:18:17.525
Oh God. It hurts.

1139
01:18:17.608 --> 01:18:19.585
-I know. I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

1140
01:18:23.733 --> 01:18:25.816
I can't believe you walked
all the way here.

1141
01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:28.717
They took my car and my phone.

1142
01:18:36.923 --> 01:18:38.416
-Thank you for...
-Yeah.

1143
01:18:41.639 --> 01:18:43.992
Did he get all your money?

1144
01:18:46.827 --> 01:18:47.827
Oh no.

1145
01:18:48.593 --> 01:18:50.643
Why can't you just hack him
and get it back.

1146
01:18:51.843 --> 01:18:53.750
Because he's a better hacker
than I am.

1147
01:18:55.898 --> 01:18:56.898
I mean...

1148
01:19:00.491 --> 01:19:01.967
It's gone. Dad. it's gone.

1149
01:19:07.733 --> 01:19:09.934
You-- you just called me Dad.

1150
01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:20.760
You have...

1151
01:19:23.534 --> 01:19:25.190
You have your mother's eyes.

1152
01:19:55.965 --> 01:19:57.433
[laughs]

1153
01:20:01.744 --> 01:20:03.775
[continues laughing]

1154
01:20:04.307 --> 01:20:05.307
