00:01:27.295 --> 00:01:29.297
Next.

4
00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:53.112
Name. Candidate Number.

5
00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:56.115
Alex Small. Candidate number 152.

6
00:04:17.715 --> 00:04:18.383
Hey.

7
00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:19.175
Is anyone sitting here?

8
00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:20.009
Um. No.

9
00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:21.594
No one's sat there.

10
00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:16.983
By the way...

11
00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:18.443
Liv.

12
00:05:18.609 --> 00:05:19.861
You know my name?

13
00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:21.154
Um... Sorry... You...

14
00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:21.738
No. No.

15
00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:22.697
Don't worry.

16
00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:24.532
I might know yours.

17
00:05:24.615 --> 00:05:25.241
It's...

18
00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:26.492
Umm...

19
00:05:26.784 --> 00:05:27.535
Oh. Alex.

20
00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:27.827
Yep.

21
00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:29.245
Yeah. Of course. Yeah.

22
00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:31.539
Um.

23
00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:37.253
Well. Alex. Nice to meet you... And see you around. I guess.

24
00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:06.986
Hey. Who do you think will get the part?

25
00:08:07.028 --> 00:08:09.030
Umm... I'm not sure.

26
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.782
You're new aren't you?

27
00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:12.700
No.

28
00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.242
Oh yeah?

29
00:08:13.242 --> 00:08:14.702
Yeah. Yeah. I've been in a couple of productions.

30
00:08:14.702 --> 00:08:15.870
Oh. sorry.

31
00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:18.873
Which company have you acted for?

32
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.167
Well...

33
00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:22.543
They were at school. actually.

34
00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.711
Oh.

35
00:08:32.887 --> 00:08:34.889
Good morning.

36
00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:42.063
Well done on getting this far.

37
00:08:42.104 --> 00:08:43.397
But it's high stakes from now on.

38
00:08:43.397 --> 00:08:46.275
If you can't take it. go do some amateur production. Yeah?

39
00:08:46.817 --> 00:08:48.361
Right. Here's the list.

40
00:08:48.444 --> 00:08:50.863
Oli. You're Scholar Two.

41
00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:54.533
David. You're Scholar One. the Chorus. and Robin.

42
00:08:54.992 --> 00:08:56.994
Camille. You're Wagner and the Emperor.

43
00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:59.538
You did a good audition. You got yourself two big parts.

44
00:09:00.414 --> 00:09:02.124
But we're doing callbacks for the leads.

45
00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:03.584
For Alex and Charlie.

46
00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:04.377
Who?

47
00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:06.087
Alex Small. Here's here at the front.

48
00:09:06.128 --> 00:09:07.588
He was good.

49
00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:09.257
He earned a second viewing.

50
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:11.592
Callbacks will be on Monday.

51
00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:13.761
Charlie at four. Alex at four-thirty.

52
00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:15.930
Learn pages one-nine-four to seven.

53
00:09:17.431 --> 00:09:19.433
Thanks guys.

54
00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:30.903
For fuck's sake.

55
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.472
You alright?

56
00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:05.438
No I don't.

57
00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:16.574
You know doing that'll kill you.

58
00:10:19.368 --> 00:10:20.620
The cigarettes will kill you obviously.

59
00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.414
But no one thinks about dying of a habit.

60
00:10:23.414 --> 00:10:27.209
A habit that will make you an expert in killing yourself.

61
00:10:27.209 --> 00:10:30.838
Go to a doctor. try to save yourself. But they're not gonna help you. Why would they?

62
00:10:30.838 --> 00:10:34.842
In their eyes you deserve to die because you smoked cigarettes.

63
00:10:34.884 --> 00:10:39.472
Go on then. Light it. The damage is done. I suppose.

64
00:10:45.394 --> 00:10:47.396
How rude of me... Elliot.

65
00:10:47.563 --> 00:10:48.939
Alex.

66
00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:51.067
Tonne of emails to get through.

67
00:10:51.275 --> 00:10:54.362
One of our guys. Michael. just signed this girl. Grace.

68
00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:56.364
She couldn't rip her way out of a paper bag.

69
00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:58.741
She said in her resume that she could speak Italian.

70
00:10:58.741 --> 00:11:03.204
So what did I do? I had her sent out to Milan for an audition.

71
00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:06.791
Turns out... Michael. the idiot. was more concerned about her bra size

72
00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:08.959
than her resume. I think.

73
00:11:09.251 --> 00:11:10.378
What do you do. Alex?

74
00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:11.879
I'm an actor.

75
00:11:12.296 --> 00:11:13.381
No shit.

76
00:11:13.798 --> 00:11:14.840
What's your next show?

77
00:11:15.299 --> 00:11:16.342
Dr Faustus.

78
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:18.552
Dr Faustus. Yeah. I remember you.

79
00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:19.595
The sweaty one.

80
00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:20.596
Sweaty?

81
00:11:20.763 --> 00:11:22.223
How'd you think it went?

82
00:11:22.556 --> 00:11:24.558
Got a call back.

83
00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:27.561
Done much acting before?

84
00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:28.729
Um.

85
00:11:28.729 --> 00:11:31.607
Sorry -- could I get a light?

86
00:11:37.154 --> 00:11:39.156
You alright?

87
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:41.992
Yeah. Yeah. Fine.

88
00:11:45.496 --> 00:11:47.081
Carry on. You were saying?

89
00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.791
Yeah. No. I--

90
00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.751
I thought about going to acting school.

91
00:11:51.043 --> 00:11:52.420
That's a nice thought.

92
00:11:52.711 --> 00:11:54.422
My parents and teachers didn't really back me.

93
00:11:54.672 --> 00:11:56.674
And you believed them?

94
00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:57.925
It's not that simple.

95
00:11:57.925 --> 00:11:59.093
Course it isn't.

96
00:11:59.301 --> 00:11:59.969
What would I know?

97
00:11:59.969 --> 00:12:00.886
I'm sorry I--

98
00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:04.682
No. I get it. You're either the director's type or the son of somebody.

99
00:12:05.349 --> 00:12:06.517
I know.

100
00:12:06.767 --> 00:12:08.769
Doesn't that piss you off?

101
00:12:10.354 --> 00:12:10.938
A bit.

102
00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.982
You know Tom's already made up his mind.

103
00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:16.569
About Camille. Not about you.

104
00:12:17.486 --> 00:12:19.488
He loves Camille.

105
00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:22.533
Camille makes Italian Grace look like Anna Magnani.

106
00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:26.745
Thought about what you're gonna do on Monday?

107
00:12:26.787 --> 00:12:27.788
Not really.

108
00:12:27.788 --> 00:12:29.373
Don't you have a plan?

109
00:12:29.832 --> 00:12:30.624
Well... I thought... Maybe--

110
00:12:30.624 --> 00:12:31.834
Look. Alex.

111
00:12:32.001 --> 00:12:33.335
The best people I work with.

112
00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:36.922
They'll read a script a hundred times before they go into an audition.

113
00:12:37.339 --> 00:12:39.341
The ones who don't...

114
00:12:39.925 --> 00:12:41.927
They're a waste of time.

115
00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:50.478
I don't like to waste my time.

116
00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:19.543
Do you mind waiting here a minute?

117
00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:20.711
Yeah. Sure.

118
00:15:20.711 --> 00:15:21.879
Nice work.

119
00:15:22.504 --> 00:15:24.506
Come on.

120
00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:28.093
Good luck mate.

121
00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:49.615
Ok. We'll go from the first paragraph of page sixty.

122
00:15:56.413 --> 00:15:58.415
Now hast thou but one bare hour to live.

123
00:15:58.415 --> 00:15:59.667
And then thou must be damned perpetually.

124
00:15:59.667 --> 00:16:01.335
Um... Let's take it back a bit.

125
00:16:01.377 --> 00:16:06.006
Slower and bring the volume down a bit.

126
00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:07.549
From perpetual.

127
00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:14.974
Perpetual day

128
00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:16.433
Or let this hour be but... Um...

129
00:16:16.433 --> 00:16:18.143
A year... A month... A week.

130
00:16:18.143 --> 00:16:19.186
A natural day.

131
00:16:19.186 --> 00:16:22.147
That Faustus may repent and save his soul.

132
00:16:23.607 --> 00:16:25.609
The stars run still.

133
00:16:25.609 --> 00:16:27.611
Alex. Stop.

134
00:16:28.862 --> 00:16:31.198
I'm sorry. Can I get some water?

135
00:16:31.782 --> 00:16:33.117
Yeah.

136
00:17:07.776 --> 00:17:08.485
What's going on?

137
00:17:08.485 --> 00:17:09.236
I'm not sure.

138
00:17:09.236 --> 00:17:10.320
What?

139
00:17:11.196 --> 00:17:12.698
I can't do it.

140
00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:14.241
There'll be other times.

141
00:17:14.241 --> 00:17:15.492
No. There won't.

142
00:17:15.492 --> 00:17:17.202
I'm not waiting thirty auditions for my part.

143
00:17:17.202 --> 00:17:18.037
Your part.

144
00:17:18.037 --> 00:17:18.996
Your part. You are hilarious.

145
00:17:18.996 --> 00:17:20.205
Waiting that long isn't fair.

146
00:17:20.205 --> 00:17:21.749
That you should earn your part like everyone else?

147
00:17:21.749 --> 00:17:22.958
What would you know about that?

148
00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:24.334
Don't question me.

149
00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:27.212
It isn't helping.

150
00:17:29.173 --> 00:17:30.174
Make them need you.

151
00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:30.799
How?

152
00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:32.009
Be like the petrol you put in your car.

153
00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:32.468
What?

154
00:17:32.468 --> 00:17:34.344
Become necessary.

155
00:17:35.596 --> 00:17:37.598
Look.

156
00:17:37.806 --> 00:17:39.808
Charlie's audition was average.

157
00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:43.020
He'll end up at a mid-sized city theatre doing Shakespeare in the park.

158
00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:43.645
That's it.

159
00:17:43.687 --> 00:17:45.314
Both his parents were actors.

160
00:17:45.647 --> 00:17:46.523
Average ones.

161
00:17:46.523 --> 00:17:49.276
But what's he done with that?

162
00:17:51.612 --> 00:17:52.988
Your parents were what?

163
00:17:52.988 --> 00:17:53.989
Accountants? Lawyers? Doctors?

164
00:17:53.989 --> 00:17:54.948
Mum's a teacher.

165
00:17:54.948 --> 00:17:55.741
Teacher.

166
00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:56.784
And your dad?

167
00:17:59.661 --> 00:18:01.663
Exactly.

168
00:18:02.331 --> 00:18:04.333
I don't think Charlie deserves the part.

169
00:18:05.709 --> 00:18:07.711
Do you?

170
00:18:14.301 --> 00:18:16.095
Can I do the start of act three?

171
00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:20.224
Yeah. If that means you'll get it right.

172
00:18:27.689 --> 00:18:33.612
Having now. my good Mephistopheles.
Pass'd with delight the stately town of Trier.

173
00:18:33.612 --> 00:18:35.989
Environ'd round with airy mountain-tops.

174
00:18:35.989 --> 00:18:42.412
With walls of flint. and deep-entrenched lakes.
Not to be won by any conquering prince;

175
00:18:42.412 --> 00:18:46.834
From Paris next. coasting the realm of France.
We saw the river Maine fall into Rhine.

176
00:18:46.834 --> 00:18:52.631
Whose banks are set with groves of fruitful vines;

177
00:18:52.631 --> 00:18:56.510
Then up to Naples. rich Campania.

178
00:18:56.510 --> 00:19:01.932
Whose buildings fair and gorgeous to the eye.
The streets straight forth. and pav'd with finest brick.

179
00:19:01.932 --> 00:19:09.356
Quarter the town in four equivalents: There saw we learned Maro's golden tomb.

180
00:19:09.356 --> 00:19:15.654
The way he cut. an English mile in length.
Thorough a rock of stone. in one night's space;

181
00:19:15.654 --> 00:19:21.118
From thence to Venice. Padua. and the rest.

182
00:19:21.118 --> 00:19:28.625
In one of which a sumptuous temple stands.
That threats the stars with her aspiring top.

183
00:19:28.625 --> 00:19:31.795
Thus hitherto hath Faustus spent his time:

184
00:19:31.795 --> 00:19:35.340
But tell me now what resting-place is this?

185
00:19:40.888 --> 00:19:42.890
Get in.

186
00:19:46.268 --> 00:19:48.270
I want you two to try something.

187
00:19:48.729 --> 00:19:50.189
Play out the scene between you.

188
00:19:50.272 --> 00:19:52.274
Alex. reading for Faustus. Charlie. for Mephistopheles.

189
00:19:52.774 --> 00:19:54.234
Here. use this.

190
00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:56.528
I want to see the dynamic between you.

191
00:19:57.154 --> 00:19:58.697
Let's go from page hundred and eighty eight.

192
00:19:58.739 --> 00:20:00.741
From. accursed Faustus.

193
00:20:05.913 --> 00:20:13.045
Accursed Faustus. where is mercy now?
I do repent; and yet I do despair:

194
00:20:14.171 --> 00:20:17.633
Hell strives with grace for conquest in my breast:

195
00:20:17.799 --> 00:20:19.801
What shall I do to shun the snares of death?

196
00:20:19.843 --> 00:20:21.845
Thou traitor. Faustus. I arrest thy soul

197
00:20:22.012 --> 00:20:24.681
For disobedience to my sovereign lord:

198
00:20:24.806 --> 00:20:27.267
Revolt. and I'll in piecemeal tear thy flesh.

199
00:20:27.267 --> 00:20:28.602
Torment sweet friend.

200
00:20:28.602 --> 00:20:30.479
That durst dissuade me from thy Lucifer.

201
00:20:30.562 --> 00:20:32.564
Um... That's it.

202
00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:35.067
Yeah. We'll stick with these roles.

203
00:20:36.485 --> 00:20:38.445
Tomorrow. Eight thirty. be there.

204
00:20:38.445 --> 00:20:41.823
We're doing Wagner and the Scholars on page hundred-and-twenty-two.

205
00:21:33.166 --> 00:21:34.710
Hey Liv.

206
00:21:34.793 --> 00:21:36.295
Alex. Hey.

207
00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:37.838
Did you get my?

208
00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.132
Doesn't matter.

209
00:21:40.966 --> 00:21:42.968
How do you fancy getting a drink?

210
00:21:43.218 --> 00:21:45.220
Or a chat? Sometime.

211
00:21:45.387 --> 00:21:47.389
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

212
00:21:47.431 --> 00:21:49.433
That sounds really nice.

213
00:21:51.893 --> 00:21:53.895
Well... What about now?

214
00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:54.813
Um. Yeah.

215
00:21:54.813 --> 00:21:55.272
Yeah.

216
00:21:55.272 --> 00:21:55.897
That sounds great.

217
00:21:55.897 --> 00:21:57.316
Yeah. Ok.

218
00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:10.996
How did you know where I was gonna be in the library?

219
00:22:11.705 --> 00:22:13.165
It's where we first met.

220
00:22:13.457 --> 00:22:14.958
Oh yeah.

221
00:22:15.167 --> 00:22:16.418
Yeah. I like that spot.

222
00:22:16.543 --> 00:22:18.545
Oh yeah? How come?

223
00:22:18.795 --> 00:22:20.797
Just... Nice view.

224
00:22:21.882 --> 00:22:23.133
Kinda like up here.

225
00:22:23.216 --> 00:22:24.343
Yeah.

226
00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:25.927
I've never actually been up here.

227
00:22:25.927 --> 00:22:26.553
Really?

228
00:22:26.553 --> 00:22:27.220
Yeah.

229
00:22:27.721 --> 00:22:29.973
And I used to live just over there.

230
00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.642
How come you haven't come up?

231
00:22:34.728 --> 00:22:37.481
I think I was waiting for someone to take me.

232
00:22:38.899 --> 00:22:42.694
It's even better in the day. We should come back.

233
00:22:44.821 --> 00:22:46.490
So what do you do up here?

234
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:48.992
I dunno. I take photos sometimes.

235
00:22:49.242 --> 00:22:49.910
Really?

236
00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:50.577
Let's have a look.

237
00:22:50.577 --> 00:22:51.244
Oh no.

238
00:22:51.244 --> 00:22:52.871
They're on a film camera.

239
00:22:52.996 --> 00:22:54.998
Oh. Like a polaroid?

240
00:22:56.249 --> 00:22:57.334
Pretty much.

241
00:22:57.334 --> 00:22:58.668
Just like a proper film one.

242
00:22:59.503 --> 00:23:01.505
That's really cool.

243
00:23:02.172 --> 00:23:03.632
Yeah it was my dad's. actually.

244
00:23:03.673 --> 00:23:05.050
Is he a photographer?

245
00:23:05.092 --> 00:23:09.971
No. No. He's just dad.

246
00:23:11.223 --> 00:23:12.974
But yeah. I never got around to developing them.

247
00:23:13.016 --> 00:23:15.018
Right. Yeah.

248
00:23:17.979 --> 00:23:20.774
My dad has this vintage vinyl player.

249
00:23:20.816 --> 00:23:22.818
But he never lets me use it.

250
00:23:23.193 --> 00:23:25.195
So. at least he trusts you with his stuff.

251
00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:28.532
I don't know if he did. really.

252
00:23:30.409 --> 00:23:31.660
But. anyway.

253
00:23:31.952 --> 00:23:33.286
What do you listen to?

254
00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:34.371
On the vinyl.

255
00:23:35.163 --> 00:23:36.832
It's not mine. It's my dad's.

256
00:23:36.915 --> 00:23:39.334
Yeah. but there's no way that stops you. right?

257
00:23:39.376 --> 00:23:41.378
Yeah. You're right.

258
00:23:41.795 --> 00:23:43.797
What would you play?

259
00:23:44.548 --> 00:23:45.382
No. You first.

260
00:23:45.382 --> 00:23:45.966
Why?

261
00:23:45.966 --> 00:23:49.052
Because if I tell you. you're going to think I'm a massive nerd.

262
00:23:49.052 --> 00:23:51.054
Trust me. My taste is worse. I guarantee.

263
00:23:51.054 --> 00:23:51.638
It can't be.

264
00:23:51.638 --> 00:23:52.264
Yeah.

265
00:23:52.264 --> 00:23:53.515
What is it?

266
00:23:54.141 --> 00:23:56.101
Well. They're kinda lame but...

267
00:23:56.101 --> 00:23:58.436
No. I can't. I can already feel the judgment.

268
00:23:58.436 --> 00:24:00.147
I'll just have to assume the worst then.

269
00:24:00.147 --> 00:24:01.523
Oh yeah? What's that?

270
00:24:01.523 --> 00:24:02.732
Fleetwood Mac. probably.

271
00:24:02.732 --> 00:24:03.525
Why?

272
00:24:04.067 --> 00:24:05.443
They're for hippies...

273
00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:08.238
And for middle-aged women who think they're cool.

274
00:24:08.446 --> 00:24:10.449
Ok. Well. I like them.

275
00:24:11.575 --> 00:24:12.742
You... Like them?

276
00:24:12.742 --> 00:24:13.243
Yeah.

277
00:24:13.285 --> 00:24:13.785
Fleetwood Mac?

278
00:24:13.785 --> 00:24:15.287
I love Fleetwood Mac.

279
00:24:15.996 --> 00:24:17.330
That makes me look quite bad. doesn't it?

280
00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:17.998
A little bit.

281
00:24:20.667 --> 00:24:23.003
So. what are you into. then. Alex?

282
00:24:23.211 --> 00:24:26.006
Oh. You know. The Rolling Stones... The Cure.

283
00:24:26.214 --> 00:24:28.216
Mostly cool 70s and 80s rock.

284
00:24:32.387 --> 00:24:34.389
Josh tells me you're in a play?

285
00:24:34.806 --> 00:24:35.640
Yeah.

286
00:24:36.224 --> 00:24:37.350
How'd you know him?

287
00:24:37.601 --> 00:24:39.603
We do English together.

288
00:24:40.312 --> 00:24:42.314
Oh yeah.

289
00:24:44.316 --> 00:24:47.194
You know. for an actor I always thought you were quite shy.

290
00:24:47.944 --> 00:24:50.280
In lectures you always had your head down.

291
00:24:50.572 --> 00:24:52.157
Looking around somewhere.

292
00:24:52.407 --> 00:24:54.409
My sister says I do that.

293
00:24:54.576 --> 00:24:57.287
I always wondered if I'd be in a class with you and find out.

294
00:24:57.913 --> 00:24:58.747
But...

295
00:24:58.747 --> 00:25:01.082
I guess I was never meant to know.

296
00:25:01.374 --> 00:25:03.376
And I guess you never will.

297
00:25:03.543 --> 00:25:04.211
Oh. Won't I?

298
00:25:04.211 --> 00:25:05.253
Maybe.

299
00:25:05.253 --> 00:25:06.213
Ok...

300
00:25:06.755 --> 00:25:08.757
It's Faustus. right?

301
00:25:09.216 --> 00:25:10.634
Yeah.

302
00:25:10.634 --> 00:25:11.801
I'm surprised Josh remembered that.

303
00:25:11.801 --> 00:25:12.719
Oh. He didn't.

304
00:25:12.719 --> 00:25:14.012
Who's directing?

305
00:25:15.222 --> 00:25:16.306
Tom Sutton.

306
00:25:16.431 --> 00:25:18.141
Produced by this guy. Elliot.

307
00:25:18.266 --> 00:25:20.268
Wow. He's serious.

308
00:25:20.852 --> 00:25:21.895
You must be good.

309
00:25:21.895 --> 00:25:23.188
Who are you playing?

310
00:25:24.105 --> 00:25:25.023
Um.

311
00:25:25.357 --> 00:25:27.359
Faustus. I think.

312
00:25:27.943 --> 00:25:29.528
You think?

313
00:25:29.611 --> 00:25:31.613
So you are Faustus?

314
00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:36.409
A modest actor. How strange.

315
00:25:41.122 --> 00:25:41.790
What's up?

316
00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:43.124
Doesn't matter.

317
00:25:45.001 --> 00:25:46.670
You're hardly boastful.

318
00:25:46.711 --> 00:25:47.879
Oh yeah?

319
00:25:48.004 --> 00:25:52.509
Yeah. I heard you were a bit of a prodigy.

320
00:25:52.592 --> 00:25:53.718
Not just a bit.

321
00:25:54.135 --> 00:25:55.178
Ok. I take that back.

322
00:25:55.178 --> 00:25:56.137
I'm kidding.

323
00:25:58.056 --> 00:26:01.393
Remember that time Professor Thompson did that lecture on 17th century Chinese seeds?

324
00:26:01.393 --> 00:26:03.395
Yeah. That's what I was gonna say.

325
00:26:03.436 --> 00:26:04.229
How could I forget that?

326
00:26:04.229 --> 00:26:05.438
So weird.

327
00:26:07.023 --> 00:26:08.733
He's quite cute. though.

328
00:26:08.733 --> 00:26:09.818
Do you not feel?

329
00:26:10.026 --> 00:26:12.028
I feel like you've said that before.

330
00:26:12.779 --> 00:26:14.364
Do you fancy him?

331
00:26:14.573 --> 00:26:16.575
Maybe...

332
00:26:20.203 --> 00:26:22.914
People tend to know when I like them.

333
00:26:29.838 --> 00:26:31.840
See you. Alex.

334
00:28:39.843 --> 00:28:41.094
Good.

335
00:28:44.556 --> 00:28:45.682
Sorry I'm late.

336
00:28:45.682 --> 00:28:47.225
Why are you late?

337
00:28:47.225 --> 00:28:48.893
Sorry. I just popped to the loo.

338
00:28:48.893 --> 00:28:51.688
Brilliant. Would have thought someone your age would be able to

339
00:28:51.688 --> 00:28:53.940
Control his own bladder.

340
00:28:54.858 --> 00:28:55.442
What?

341
00:28:55.442 --> 00:28:56.818
Go on. Off you go.

342
00:28:56.901 --> 00:28:57.736
I'm like a minute late.

343
00:28:57.736 --> 00:28:59.404
Yes. Late being the operative word.

344
00:28:59.404 --> 00:29:00.280
It's just a minute.

345
00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:01.740
It's the first rehearsal. What kind of precedent are you trying to set?

346
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:03.158
Tom. Chill out.

347
00:29:03.158 --> 00:29:04.492
Come in. David.

348
00:29:16.838 --> 00:29:20.383
Just. Don't turn up late to my rehearsals. Ok?

349
00:29:21.301 --> 00:29:24.012
Ok. For those of you who haven't heard.

350
00:29:24.012 --> 00:29:26.431
I've chosen Alex to be Faustus.

351
00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:28.349
And Charlie to be Mephistopheles.

352
00:29:28.349 --> 00:29:29.601
Did you get that. David?

353
00:29:29.601 --> 00:29:31.895
Yeah. Loud and clear.

354
00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:34.772
Don't let me down.

355
00:29:35.857 --> 00:29:37.066
Ok!

356
00:29:37.525 --> 00:29:39.611
Camille. David. Charlie. You are up.

357
00:29:39.611 --> 00:29:40.862
Page forty.

358
00:29:40.862 --> 00:29:41.988
Use your own scripts.

359
00:29:41.988 --> 00:29:44.407
Add your own movements and we'll work on it from there.

360
00:29:44.407 --> 00:29:45.408
Ok?

361
00:29:52.582 --> 00:29:54.250
Well. sirrah. follow me.

362
00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:58.379
But. do you hear? If I should serve you. would you teach me to raise up Banios and Belcheos?

363
00:29:58.379 --> 00:30:01.591
I will teach thee to turn thyself to any thing.

364
00:30:01.591 --> 00:30:05.553
to a cat. or a dog. or a mouse. or a rat. or any thing.

365
00:30:05.553 --> 00:30:06.846
How! A Christian fellow-

366
00:30:06.846 --> 00:30:07.597
Let's stop it there.

367
00:30:07.597 --> 00:30:09.390
David. Are you with us today?

368
00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:11.351
Yeah. Yeah. Of course.

369
00:30:11.351 --> 00:30:14.479
Show me. Right now you're acting like C3PO without an WD40.

370
00:30:15.396 --> 00:30:16.648
Ok. Sorry.

371
00:30:16.648 --> 00:30:19.400
Don't apologise. David. That won't make it any better.

372
00:30:20.568 --> 00:30:22.570
Camille. Show us how it's done.

373
00:30:22.654 --> 00:30:25.865
Give us the Emperor's monologue on page a hundred and seventy two.

374
00:30:36.793 --> 00:30:39.754
Then. Doctor Faustus. mark what I shall say.

375
00:30:39.754 --> 00:30:46.094
As I was sometimes solitary set within my closet sundry thoughts arose about the honour of mine ancestors.

376
00:30:46.094 --> 00:30:48.763
How they had won by prowess such exploits.

377
00:30:48.763 --> 00:30:52.225
Got such riches. subdu'd so many kingdoms.

378
00:30:52.225 --> 00:30:54.561
As we that do succeed. or they that shall

379
00:30:54.561 --> 00:30:57.814
Hereafter possess our throne. shallI fear me

380
00:30:57.814 --> 00:31:02.652
Never attain to that degree
Of high renown and great authority:

381
00:31:02.652 --> 00:31:05.989
Amongst which kings is Alexander the Great.

382
00:31:05.989 --> 00:31:07.991
Chief spectacle of the world's pre-eminence.

383
00:31:07.991 --> 00:31:10.952
The bright shining of whose glorious acts

384
00:31:10.952 --> 00:31:14.664
Lightens the world with his reflecting beams.

385
00:31:14.664 --> 00:31:19.002
As when I hear but motion made of him.
It grieves my soul I never saw the man:

386
00:31:19.002 --> 00:31:21.004
Camille. Can you read?

387
00:31:23.965 --> 00:31:25.967
Well?

388
00:31:26.467 --> 00:31:28.469
Can you read?

389
00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:29.762
I'm trying it's just.

390
00:31:29.762 --> 00:31:31.431
Just what?

391
00:31:31.639 --> 00:31:32.891
I only got the part last week.

392
00:31:32.891 --> 00:31:36.269
Can you believe it? A whole week to brush up on your handful of lines?

393
00:31:36.352 --> 00:31:37.395
It's a lot.

394
00:31:37.395 --> 00:31:38.062
Really?

395
00:31:38.062 --> 00:31:40.064
Charlie's doing much better and he only got the part last week.

396
00:31:40.064 --> 00:31:42.275
But... I mean he's done this kind of thing before.

397
00:31:42.275 --> 00:31:43.318
Thing? What thing?

398
00:31:43.318 --> 00:31:44.152
Please. Enlighten me.

399
00:31:44.152 --> 00:31:45.194
Enlighten us.

400
00:31:45.194 --> 00:31:47.071
Well. His style is not what I'm used to.

401
00:31:47.071 --> 00:31:49.782
What I'm used to...

402
00:31:51.075 --> 00:31:53.077
What I'm used to...

403
00:31:54.913 --> 00:31:56.789
And you do you think Rada cares one bit.

404
00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:59.834
One tiny little bit if you haven't done this kind of thing before?

405
00:32:00.835 --> 00:32:01.669
No.

406
00:32:02.337 --> 00:32:03.713
They'll get someone better.

407
00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:05.632
Maybe I should do that.

408
00:32:07.258 --> 00:32:08.092
You've made your point.

409
00:32:08.092 --> 00:32:10.553
No. I haven't. I'm just wondering why you turn up looking

410
00:32:10.553 --> 00:32:13.806
Like you've been out the night before to our first rehearsal?

411
00:32:13.806 --> 00:32:15.350
Are you trying to ruin my show?

412
00:32:15.516 --> 00:32:16.309
No.

413
00:32:16.309 --> 00:32:17.268
Tom. You've made your point.

414
00:32:17.268 --> 00:32:20.271
Shut up! There's no way someone who's going to Rada acts like that.

415
00:32:20.271 --> 00:32:21.814
Ever.

416
00:32:21.814 --> 00:32:23.691
Maybe mummy and daddy can help with that.

417
00:32:23.691 --> 00:32:25.735
But not in my show and not in my rehearsal.

418
00:32:25.735 --> 00:32:28.446
Do you have any idea how important that monologue is?

419
00:32:28.446 --> 00:32:30.448
You do it anything like that and you've ruined the whole show.

420
00:32:30.448 --> 00:32:31.783
So I'll ask you again.

421
00:32:31.783 --> 00:32:34.285
Are you trying to ruin my show?!

422
00:32:35.328 --> 00:32:37.330
What?

423
00:32:39.832 --> 00:32:41.834
You're awfully quiet for an actor.

424
00:32:42.335 --> 00:32:44.170
So I'll ask you one more time.

425
00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:46.506
Are you trying to ruin my show?!

426
00:32:46.506 --> 00:32:48.049
Control yourself! You've done enough here.

427
00:32:48.049 --> 00:32:50.551
Yeah it's our show as much as it is yours.

428
00:32:50.551 --> 00:32:51.928
Actually look.

429
00:32:51.928 --> 00:32:53.012
Here goes your show.

430
00:32:53.012 --> 00:32:55.348
Wait. What are you doing? We've got twenty minutes left here.

431
00:32:55.348 --> 00:32:57.850
No. You do.

432
00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.482
Same time tomorrow.

433
00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:10.863
Alex.

434
00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:13.032
You stayed.

435
00:33:14.909 --> 00:33:16.911
You starting to see the level I want you at.

436
00:33:18.204 --> 00:33:19.539
Yeah.

437
00:33:19.831 --> 00:33:21.332
This is the big leagues.

438
00:33:21.708 --> 00:33:23.710
That right there. What I just did.

439
00:33:24.001 --> 00:33:25.336
That's normal.

440
00:33:25.586 --> 00:33:27.588
That's how all the greats do it.

441
00:33:27.839 --> 00:33:29.841
Those guys are used to it anyway.

442
00:33:30.925 --> 00:33:32.301
It didn't really seem like it.

443
00:33:32.301 --> 00:33:33.594
Camille. She'll be fine.

444
00:33:33.594 --> 00:33:34.554
We go way back.

445
00:33:34.554 --> 00:33:36.973
She loves herself too much.

446
00:33:38.141 --> 00:33:39.100
But...

447
00:33:39.767 --> 00:33:41.269
It didn't even look that bad.

448
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.769
What?

449
00:33:41.978 --> 00:33:43.980
That performance?

450
00:33:44.063 --> 00:33:46.065
That's why I'm the director and Camille...

451
00:33:46.774 --> 00:33:48.776
Well...

452
00:33:49.027 --> 00:33:49.736
She just

453
00:33:49.736 --> 00:33:51.237
Needs to be reminded who's in charge.

454
00:33:51.237 --> 00:33:52.196
He just wants her.

455
00:33:52.196 --> 00:33:53.531
And that works for Camille.

456
00:33:53.698 --> 00:33:54.866
What? In your opinion?

457
00:33:54.866 --> 00:33:55.867
No. From experience.

458
00:33:55.867 --> 00:33:56.993
Something you lack.

459
00:33:59.287 --> 00:34:01.289
So what's my version of getting shouted at?

460
00:34:02.832 --> 00:34:04.834
Not sure yet.

461
00:34:06.002 --> 00:34:08.755
If he shouted at you. you'd cry like a little bitch.

462
00:34:12.175 --> 00:34:14.177
Food for thought.

463
00:34:24.145 --> 00:34:26.147
Starting to get the picture?

464
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:27.148
Yeah.

465
00:34:27.482 --> 00:34:28.566
It's pretty clear. thanks.

466
00:34:28.566 --> 00:34:30.026
Don't be like that.

467
00:34:30.985 --> 00:34:32.361
I'm on your side.

468
00:34:32.904 --> 00:34:34.906
Great.

469
00:34:35.406 --> 00:34:37.408
Can't wait for some more life coaching.

470
00:34:37.658 --> 00:34:39.077
Yeah. well. I'm the only friend you have.

471
00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:41.162
You're not the only friend I have.

472
00:34:46.083 --> 00:34:48.085
Do you see how much we believe in you?

473
00:34:49.587 --> 00:34:51.589
Yeah.

474
00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:58.721
No pressure. then.

475
00:35:16.948 --> 00:35:18.574
He made her cry in front of all of us.

476
00:35:18.825 --> 00:35:20.117
He did that in front of all of you?

477
00:35:20.117 --> 00:35:20.785
Yeah.

478
00:35:20.785 --> 00:35:21.619
He made her cry?

479
00:35:21.619 --> 00:35:22.453
Yes.

480
00:35:22.453 --> 00:35:23.788
Don't you think that's a bit much?

481
00:35:23.788 --> 00:35:25.039
Not really.

482
00:35:25.039 --> 00:35:26.833
He'll get the best out of us.

483
00:35:26.833 --> 00:35:28.000
Wait so.

484
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.460
How made who cry?

485
00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.003
Tom Sutton.

486
00:35:31.003 --> 00:35:32.171
Is that supposed to mean something?

487
00:35:32.171 --> 00:35:32.839
Yes.

488
00:35:32.839 --> 00:35:35.049
He's a big director here.

489
00:35:35.049 --> 00:35:36.175
Oh.

490
00:35:36.175 --> 00:35:37.343
Ok.

491
00:35:37.343 --> 00:35:38.469
That's good. then.

492
00:35:38.469 --> 00:35:38.886
Sure.

493
00:35:38.886 --> 00:35:41.597
But I just can't imagine getting so worked up over a play.

494
00:35:41.597 --> 00:35:42.765
It's more than a play.

495
00:35:42.765 --> 00:35:45.601
If he got like that with you. you'd stand up for yourself. right?

496
00:35:45.601 --> 00:35:46.686
I'm sure he would.

497
00:35:46.686 --> 00:35:48.521
If I'd been performing badly. probably not.

498
00:35:48.521 --> 00:35:49.355
That's stupid.

499
00:35:49.355 --> 00:35:50.064
Is it?

500
00:35:50.064 --> 00:35:52.692
Well. yes. It is for a university play.

501
00:35:52.692 --> 00:35:54.902
You gotta start thinking beyond that now. Alex.

502
00:35:54.902 --> 00:35:58.239
Miles just got an offer for a PhD at King's.

503
00:35:58.239 --> 00:36:01.284
And your sister got an interview at Taylor and Sharp next month.

504
00:36:01.284 --> 00:36:03.411
Wow. Quite the power couple.

505
00:36:03.411 --> 00:36:04.453
Can't you just be proud of her?

506
00:36:04.453 --> 00:36:05.037
I am.

507
00:36:05.037 --> 00:36:05.746
It's ok.

508
00:36:05.746 --> 00:36:07.915
No. It's not.

509
00:36:07.915 --> 00:36:10.042
When's the interview?

510
00:36:10.042 --> 00:36:11.669
Twenty-first or twenty-second.

511
00:36:11.669 --> 00:36:13.212
Four weeks or so.

512
00:36:13.212 --> 00:36:14.881
Oh. Hey. I was thinking maybe

513
00:36:14.881 --> 00:36:17.341
We could go away together. Spend a few days--

514
00:36:17.341 --> 00:36:19.010
Wait. Hold on. That's the same day as the play.

515
00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:20.511
Oh well. There'll be another in a few weeks.

516
00:36:20.511 --> 00:36:21.387
No there won't.

517
00:36:21.387 --> 00:36:23.306
Wait. They'll probably cancel.

518
00:36:23.306 --> 00:36:24.640
Why would they do that?

519
00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:27.768
Sometimes they fill the positions and they cancel.

520
00:36:27.768 --> 00:36:28.603
Rarely.

521
00:36:28.603 --> 00:36:30.771
So you don't mind being told you're not good enough

522
00:36:30.771 --> 00:36:31.689
Without getting a sitting?

523
00:36:31.689 --> 00:36:33.357
No. It's different.

524
00:36:33.357 --> 00:36:34.358
It's a job.

525
00:36:34.358 --> 00:36:37.195
And a PhD is?

526
00:36:37.195 --> 00:36:38.571
When you get to our age you'll understand.

527
00:36:38.571 --> 00:36:39.989
I understand fine thanks.

528
00:36:39.989 --> 00:36:42.575
It's so uncertain. So few people make it.

529
00:36:42.575 --> 00:36:43.451
Why's that so laughable?

530
00:36:43.451 --> 00:36:46.829
Because you. my friend. would be more successful if you were more serious.

531
00:36:46.829 --> 00:36:47.246
No. Miles.

532
00:36:47.246 --> 00:36:47.747
Piss off.

533
00:36:47.747 --> 00:36:49.040
What do you know anyway?

534
00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:49.957
Clearly. more than you.

535
00:36:49.957 --> 00:36:52.418
I don't have to hear this.

536
00:36:52.418 --> 00:36:55.838
Enjoy wasting your time on a qualification that means nothing.

537
00:37:36.295 --> 00:37:37.546
It was awful.

538
00:37:37.546 --> 00:37:39.465
It was like three hours long.

539
00:37:39.465 --> 00:37:40.633
With an intermission.

540
00:37:40.633 --> 00:37:42.051
With two intermissions. actually.

541
00:37:42.051 --> 00:37:44.220
Far too long.

542
00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:45.972
Actors didn't even know their lines.

543
00:37:45.972 --> 00:37:48.140
Yeah. No. They had scripts in the last act.

544
00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:48.599
Really?

545
00:37:48.599 --> 00:37:51.978
Genuinely reading off them.

546
00:38:03.447 --> 00:38:05.449
Way too echoey.

547
00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:07.702
Tech was too loud.

548
00:38:07.785 --> 00:38:10.496
Yeah. Yeah. Just a mess. really.

549
00:38:11.122 --> 00:38:12.665
What's this?

550
00:38:12.665 --> 00:38:14.834
Hamlet. These two went to see it last night.

551
00:38:14.834 --> 00:38:16.002
Really?

552
00:38:16.002 --> 00:38:18.295
Apparently it was a disaster.

553
00:38:18.295 --> 00:38:19.588
You didn't say anything about that.

554
00:38:19.588 --> 00:38:20.840
Didn't I?

555
00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.509
It was really bad. anyway.

556
00:38:24.677 --> 00:38:27.430
But that won't happen to us. That's why we're here now.

557
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:30.016
Yeah. We were just saying we really liked the last run-through.

558
00:38:30.016 --> 00:38:31.517
Yeah.

559
00:38:46.782 --> 00:38:47.742
Hi guys.

560
00:38:47.992 --> 00:38:49.994
How's it going?

561
00:38:51.078 --> 00:38:52.538
What? Is this is a rehearsal?

562
00:38:52.538 --> 00:38:53.998
Hi. I'm Tom.

563
00:38:53.998 --> 00:38:55.791
Who the fuck are you?!

564
00:38:55.791 --> 00:38:56.834
I'm Alex's girlfriend.

565
00:38:56.834 --> 00:38:58.169
Sorry. What is this?

566
00:38:58.169 --> 00:39:00.671
What is this? Tell me. What's going on?

567
00:39:01.464 --> 00:39:03.466
Something funny?

568
00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:08.012
You stay the fuck here.

569
00:39:08.304 --> 00:39:10.306
Speaking.

570
00:39:15.394 --> 00:39:17.396
Yes. We'll be ready for Wednesday.

571
00:39:17.855 --> 00:39:19.857
Yes. Even him.

572
00:39:20.608 --> 00:39:24.612
Don't worry about it. We'll stick to the plan and everything will be ok.

573
00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:27.782
I've got this.

574
00:39:32.828 --> 00:39:33.746
Ok. Stop.

575
00:39:33.746 --> 00:39:35.373
What the fuck is going on here?

576
00:39:35.373 --> 00:39:36.082
And who are you?

577
00:39:36.082 --> 00:39:37.333
I'm Alex's girlfriend.

578
00:39:37.333 --> 00:39:39.627
We just thought we'd run some lines.

579
00:39:39.627 --> 00:39:40.252
Which scenes?

580
00:39:40.252 --> 00:39:41.128
End of act five.

581
00:39:41.128 --> 00:39:41.754
Are you blocking?

582
00:39:41.754 --> 00:39:42.171
A bit.

583
00:39:42.171 --> 00:39:42.838
We thought.

584
00:39:42.838 --> 00:39:44.340
You thought you'd just turn up and do your own thing.

585
00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:45.049
No just--

586
00:39:45.049 --> 00:39:45.925
Fan-fucking-tastic.

587
00:39:45.925 --> 00:39:47.676
I mean what do I know? And what does that make you?

588
00:39:47.676 --> 00:39:48.719
The director or something?

589
00:39:48.719 --> 00:39:49.387
Obviously not.

590
00:39:49.387 --> 00:39:50.304
Then. why are you here?

591
00:39:50.304 --> 00:39:51.097
She's just watching.

592
00:39:51.097 --> 00:39:51.972
You can't just invite your mates.

593
00:39:51.972 --> 00:39:53.015
No!

594
00:39:53.015 --> 00:39:54.683
Tom. right?

595
00:39:54.683 --> 00:39:56.143
Don't talk to them like that.

596
00:39:56.143 --> 00:39:59.480
Because they're doing this for you.

597
00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:02.608
You're so arrogant.

598
00:40:07.321 --> 00:40:09.323
Who's in charge here?

599
00:40:09.865 --> 00:40:10.533
Hmm?

600
00:40:10.533 --> 00:40:11.867
I am.

601
00:40:13.369 --> 00:40:15.371
That's just great.

602
00:40:18.624 --> 00:40:19.416
No you aren't!

603
00:40:19.416 --> 00:40:20.584
Are you trying to undermine me?

604
00:40:20.584 --> 00:40:21.001
No.

605
00:40:21.001 --> 00:40:22.086
Really? It sure looks like it.

606
00:40:22.086 --> 00:40:23.963
It's nothing. We were just practicing.

607
00:40:23.963 --> 00:40:25.756
And what's another word for practicing?

608
00:40:25.756 --> 00:40:27.591
I dunno. Rehearsal.

609
00:40:27.591 --> 00:40:28.384
Well done.

610
00:40:28.384 --> 00:40:29.385
I don't know if you've noticed.

611
00:40:29.385 --> 00:40:30.970
But I'm the one who calls those around here.

612
00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:31.512
Not you!

613
00:40:31.512 --> 00:40:32.513
It's really nothing.

614
00:40:32.513 --> 00:40:34.181
This is Marlowe. as directed by me.

615
00:40:34.181 --> 00:40:35.558
And acted by you.

616
00:40:35.558 --> 00:40:36.434
I make the show

617
00:40:36.434 --> 00:40:36.851
You

618
00:40:36.851 --> 00:40:37.393
Just do it.

619
00:40:37.393 --> 00:40:38.477
Would you just calm it for one second.

620
00:40:38.477 --> 00:40:39.979
Just get out.

621
00:40:39.979 --> 00:40:41.272
I'm guessing you want us to stop?

622
00:40:41.272 --> 00:40:42.106
No. Camille.

623
00:40:42.106 --> 00:40:43.774
Of course I want you to stop.

624
00:40:43.774 --> 00:40:45.818
Now get out.

625
00:40:45.818 --> 00:40:46.986
Just leave!

626
00:40:46.986 --> 00:40:49.947
I don't wanna be here anyway.

627
00:40:49.947 --> 00:40:51.157
Not you.

628
00:40:51.157 --> 00:40:52.158
You're kidding aren't you?

629
00:40:52.158 --> 00:40:53.075
Leave him!

630
00:40:53.075 --> 00:40:55.286
I'll tell you when I want you back in my rehearsal.

631
00:40:58.289 --> 00:41:00.374
I thought you'd be different.

632
00:42:08.901 --> 00:42:10.903
Well. That was fun.

633
00:42:13.864 --> 00:42:15.866
Liv's your girlfriend.

634
00:42:16.325 --> 00:42:17.660
She's lovely.

635
00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:19.078
Yeah. She is.

636
00:42:19.078 --> 00:42:20.162
That's nice. Isn't it?

637
00:42:21.997 --> 00:42:23.207
She likes me.

638
00:42:23.958 --> 00:42:25.167
Well done.

639
00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.169
Good job.

640
00:42:29.046 --> 00:42:30.256
What were you doing here?

641
00:42:30.839 --> 00:42:32.049
What?

642
00:42:32.049 --> 00:42:33.259
Here.

643
00:42:33.384 --> 00:42:34.927
Right here. Why were you here?

644
00:42:35.803 --> 00:42:36.554
We were rehearsing.

645
00:42:36.554 --> 00:42:37.888
Rehearsing.

646
00:42:38.389 --> 00:42:39.598
Which scenes?

647
00:42:40.724 --> 00:42:41.934
The final act.

648
00:42:42.935 --> 00:42:44.144
The whole final act.

649
00:42:45.354 --> 00:42:46.563
Together.

650
00:42:47.273 --> 00:42:48.482
Without Tom.

651
00:42:49.525 --> 00:42:50.734
Yeah.

652
00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:53.862
Jesus.

653
00:43:28.814 --> 00:43:31.567
You have absolutely no idea what you've just done. Do you?

654
00:43:31.567 --> 00:43:33.986
No.

655
00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:40.075
Remember when I told you to become necessary?

656
00:43:40.159 --> 00:43:41.201
We were only rehearsing.

657
00:43:41.201 --> 00:43:43.120
Oh shut the fuck up!

658
00:43:44.538 --> 00:43:47.041
We were only rehearsing.

659
00:43:47.041 --> 00:43:51.295
You're never going to be scouted you insubordinate worm.

660
00:43:54.048 --> 00:43:56.467
It's always about the girl with you precious arty pricks.

661
00:43:57.635 --> 00:43:59.553
I'll drive you two apart.

662
00:44:00.304 --> 00:44:01.305
Do you want that?

663
00:44:01.388 --> 00:44:02.222
Leave her out of this.

664
00:44:02.264 --> 00:44:03.474
Do you want that?

665
00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:08.228
Do you want that?

666
00:44:20.532 --> 00:44:23.410
Show me your lines on one-nine-seven.

667
00:44:23.911 --> 00:44:25.120
What?

668
00:44:25.204 --> 00:44:27.539
The reason you were here. Show me.

669
00:44:38.675 --> 00:44:40.386
Ah Faustus. now hast thou but-

670
00:44:40.386 --> 00:44:43.430
Stand up. You perpetual idiot.

671
00:44:47.351 --> 00:44:48.268
Ah Faustus. now hast thou-

672
00:44:48.268 --> 00:44:50.104
Did I ask you to start speaking?

673
00:44:51.688 --> 00:44:53.690
Compose yourself as the character first.

674
00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:55.818
And then maybe say the lines.

675
00:44:59.113 --> 00:45:00.447
Ah Faustus. now hast thou but one-

676
00:45:00.447 --> 00:45:01.448
No.

677
00:45:03.158 --> 00:45:04.493
Ah Faustus. now hast thou but one bare-

678
00:45:04.493 --> 00:45:05.494
No.

679
00:45:07.287 --> 00:45:08.622
Ah Faustus. now hast thou-

680
00:45:08.622 --> 00:45:09.623
Stop.

681
00:45:13.961 --> 00:45:15.295
Say it again.

682
00:45:18.048 --> 00:45:19.383
Ah Faustus. now hast thou-

683
00:45:19.383 --> 00:45:20.384
No. That's not it.

684
00:45:20.384 --> 00:45:21.135
Ah Faustus. now-

685
00:45:21.135 --> 00:45:22.052
No.

686
00:45:22.678 --> 00:45:23.387
Ah Faustus-

687
00:45:23.387 --> 00:45:24.012
No.

688
00:45:25.472 --> 00:45:26.181
Ah Faustus. now-

689
00:45:26.181 --> 00:45:26.807
Again.

690
00:45:27.307 --> 00:45:29.059
Ah Faustus. now hast thou but one bare hour to live-

691
00:45:29.059 --> 00:45:29.893
No.

692
00:45:29.893 --> 00:45:30.936
Ah Faustus. now hast thou but one bare hour-

693
00:45:30.936 --> 00:45:31.311
No.

694
00:45:31.311 --> 00:45:32.020
Ah Faustus-

695
00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:32.354
No.

696
00:45:32.354 --> 00:45:32.938
Ah Faustus-

697
00:45:32.938 --> 00:45:33.230
No.

698
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:33.522
Ah Faustus-

699
00:45:33.522 --> 00:45:34.940
No. No. No.

700
00:45:38.819 --> 00:45:41.405
Ah Faustus. now hast thou but one bare hour to live-

701
00:45:44.825 --> 00:45:46.285
Ah Faustus. Ah Faustus.

702
00:45:46.285 --> 00:45:47.161
Say it.

703
00:45:47.161 --> 00:45:48.287
Ah Faustus.

704
00:45:48.287 --> 00:45:49.204
Mean it!

705
00:45:49.204 --> 00:45:50.706
How long do you have left to live?

706
00:45:50.706 --> 00:45:51.457
One hour.

707
00:45:51.457 --> 00:45:52.124
Sixty minutes!

708
00:45:52.124 --> 00:45:53.542
Who's coming to take you away?!

709
00:45:53.542 --> 00:45:54.418
The devil!

710
00:45:54.418 --> 00:45:57.463
The devil. I'm going to ram this into your fucking skull!

711
00:45:57.463 --> 00:45:58.755
Ah Faustus-

712
00:45:58.755 --> 00:45:59.381
Say it!

713
00:45:59.381 --> 00:46:00.174
Mean it!

714
00:46:00.174 --> 00:46:00.924
Ah Faustus-

715
00:46:00.924 --> 00:46:02.801
It's your fucking name!

716
00:46:02.801 --> 00:46:04.428
In your last moment on earth

717
00:46:04.428 --> 00:46:07.389
Show me how you fucking feel!

718
00:46:08.724 --> 00:46:10.476
Ah Faustus. now hast thou but one bare hour to live

719
00:46:10.476 --> 00:46:12.227
And then thou must be damned perpetually.

720
00:46:18.233 --> 00:46:19.985
Did I give you permission to stop speaking?

721
00:46:21.028 --> 00:46:22.780
No.

722
00:46:24.948 --> 00:46:26.700
I did.

723
00:46:37.419 --> 00:46:39.171
If you think about it.

724
00:46:41.256 --> 00:46:43.008
If you really think about it.

725
00:46:45.177 --> 00:46:47.346
Liv stood up for herself in there.

726
00:46:49.014 --> 00:46:50.766
Not both of you.

727
00:49:08.445 --> 00:49:10.447
Ok. Listen up!

728
00:49:12.658 --> 00:49:14.660
It's been a long month.

729
00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:19.039
You... Well. we. have all had some lows.

730
00:49:19.039 --> 00:49:22.668
But the standard you set tonight decides whether people will pay to see this.

731
00:49:22.668 --> 00:49:24.586
Or if they'll stay at home.

732
00:49:24.586 --> 00:49:28.256
So. bring your A game because this right here.

733
00:49:28.256 --> 00:49:30.550
Could be the start of something.

734
00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:33.011
Give them the respect they deserve.

735
00:49:33.011 --> 00:49:36.014
Give yourselves the respect you deserve.

736
00:49:36.014 --> 00:49:40.602
But most importantly give me the respect of a good show.

737
00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:46.108
Make this moment worth it.

738
00:49:46.108 --> 00:49:50.112
Ok. Get into your starting positions.

739
00:50:05.127 --> 00:50:11.174
Not marching now in fields of Thrasymene.
Where Mars did matel the Carthaginians;

740
00:50:11.174 --> 00:50:17.889
Nor sporting in the dalliance of love.
In courts of kings where state is overturn'd;

741
00:50:17.889 --> 00:50:23.562
Nor in the pomp of proud audacious deeds.
Intends our Muse to vaunt her heavenly verse:

742
00:50:23.562 --> 00:50:29.568
Only this. gentlemen. we must perform

743
00:50:29.568 --> 00:50:35.282
The form of Faustus' fortunes. good or bad:

744
00:50:35.282 --> 00:50:40.120
To patient judgments we appeal our plaud.
And speak for Faustus in his infancy.

745
00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:47.043
Now is he born. his parents base of stock.
In Germany. within a town call'd Rhodes:

746
00:50:47.043 --> 00:50:52.215
Of riper years. to Wertenberg he went.
Whereas his kinsmen chiefly brought him up.

747
00:50:52.215 --> 00:50:56.845
So soon he profits in divinity.
The fruitful plot of scholarism grac'd.

748
00:50:56.845 --> 00:51:00.348
That shortly he was grac'd with doctor's name.

749
00:51:00.348 --> 00:51:05.645
Excelling all whose sweet delight disputes
In heavenly matters of theology;

750
00:51:05.645 --> 00:51:12.736
Till swoln with cunning. of a self-conceit.

751
00:51:12.736 --> 00:51:18.742
His waxen wings did mount above his reach.
And. melting. heavens conspir'd his overthrow;

752
00:51:18.742 --> 00:51:22.412
For. falling to a devilish exercise.

753
00:52:09.918 --> 00:52:13.296
I do repent; and yet I do despair:

754
00:52:13.296 --> 00:52:16.675
Hell strives with grace for conquest in my breast:

755
00:52:16.675 --> 00:52:18.635
What shall I do to shun the snares of death?

756
00:52:18.635 --> 00:52:20.470
Thou traitor. Faustus. I arrest thy soul

757
00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:24.432
For disobedience to my sovereign lord:

758
00:52:24.516 --> 00:52:29.271
Revolt. and I'll in piecemeal tear thy flesh

759
00:52:29.271 --> 00:52:32.899
Sweet Mephistopheles. entreat thy lord
To pardon my unjust presumption.

760
00:52:32.899 --> 00:52:36.319
And with my blood again I will confirm
My former vow I made to Lucifer.

761
00:52:36.319 --> 00:52:41.199
Do it. then. quickly. with unfeigned heart.
Lest greater danger do attend thy drift.

762
00:52:41.199 --> 00:52:45.745
Torment. sweet friend.
That durst dissuade me from thy Lucifer.

763
00:52:45.745 --> 00:52:47.998
With greatest torment that hell affords...

764
00:53:10.937 --> 00:53:14.024
My God. my god. look not so fierce on me!

765
00:53:14.024 --> 00:53:18.653
Adders and serpents. let me breathe a while!
Ugly hell. gape not!

766
00:53:18.653 --> 00:53:22.824
Come not. Lucifer!
I'll burn my books!

767
00:53:22.824 --> 00:53:27.954
Mephistopheles! Mephistopheles! Mephistopheles!

768
00:53:35.712 --> 00:53:38.882
Getting there guys.

769
00:53:38.882 --> 00:53:40.425
Just a couple of things.

770
00:53:40.425 --> 00:53:42.469
Can we go from?

771
00:53:42.469 --> 00:53:47.182
Page two hundred and eight. Just before Charlie's entrance.

772
00:54:11.289 --> 00:54:14.125
How many heavens or spheres are there?

773
00:54:14.125 --> 00:54:19.005
Nine: the seven planets. the firmament. and the empyreal heaven.

774
00:54:19.005 --> 00:54:23.260
Resolve me in this question: why have we not conjunctions

775
00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:25.971
Oppositions. aspects. eclipses all at one time.

776
00:54:25.971 --> 00:54:30.016
but in some years we have more. in some less?

777
00:54:30.016 --> 00:54:31.393
Well. I am not answered.

778
00:54:31.393 --> 00:54:32.727
Tell me who made the world.

779
00:54:32.727 --> 00:54:33.561
I will not.

780
00:54:33.561 --> 00:54:35.063
Mephistopheles. tell me.

781
00:54:35.063 --> 00:54:36.940
Move me not for I will not tell thee.

782
00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:38.400
Is this it?

783
00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:40.735
Is this what I paid for?

784
00:54:40.735 --> 00:54:42.362
Ay. that is not against our kingdom. but this is.

785
00:54:42.362 --> 00:54:44.781
That's what the audience is going to think. Alex.

786
00:54:44.781 --> 00:54:46.825
Think thou on hell. Faustus. for thou art damned.

787
00:54:46.825 --> 00:54:48.827
Think. Faustus. upon God. that made the world.

788
00:54:48.827 --> 00:54:50.370
Is this the lead? Who is this guy?

789
00:54:50.370 --> 00:54:51.329
Remember this.

790
00:54:51.329 --> 00:54:53.665
Remember you’re nothing. A nobody. To anyone.

791
00:54:53.665 --> 00:54:55.333
Alex! Charlie's over here.

792
00:54:55.333 --> 00:54:56.251
What is this?

793
00:54:56.251 --> 00:54:57.002
Listen to me.

794
00:54:57.002 --> 00:54:57.919
Yeah. Yeah.

795
00:54:57.919 --> 00:54:58.753
Look at him.

796
00:54:58.753 --> 00:54:59.921
Tom's had enough.

797
00:54:59.921 --> 00:55:01.965
Well done. You do have eyes.

798
00:55:01.965 --> 00:55:03.216
What's that supposed to mean?

799
00:55:03.216 --> 00:55:03.883
You know. Those.

800
00:55:03.883 --> 00:55:06.928
Could I say it any clearer? Tom. along with all the others. have had enough of you.

801
00:55:06.928 --> 00:55:08.513
ALEX! Turn and confront Charlie!

802
00:55:08.513 --> 00:55:10.849
Ay. go. accursed spirit. to ugly hell!

803
00:55:10.849 --> 00:55:13.101
Others? Like who?

804
00:55:13.101 --> 00:55:14.978
Look at you.

805
00:55:14.978 --> 00:55:16.563
A waste of time.

806
00:55:16.563 --> 00:55:18.690
A no one. No friends. No family.

807
00:55:18.690 --> 00:55:19.482
You don't know what you're talking about.

808
00:55:19.482 --> 00:55:21.818
Oh fuck off. You maggot.

809
00:55:21.818 --> 00:55:25.113
My boss won’t even notice you tomorrow.

810
00:55:25.113 --> 00:55:28.825
Oh mummy mummy. You gonna cry about it. Why the fuck does she care?

811
00:55:28.825 --> 00:55:31.244
You're useless!

812
00:55:35.165 --> 00:55:36.958
Tears?

813
00:55:36.958 --> 00:55:39.753
You're crying now.

814
00:55:39.753 --> 00:55:41.129
You really began to believe you were something.

815
00:55:41.129 --> 00:55:41.713
Go away.

816
00:55:41.713 --> 00:55:43.381
You aren't.

817
00:55:43.381 --> 00:55:44.632
Alex. You aren't.

818
00:55:44.632 --> 00:55:47.135
That's why your sister is loved more by your mother.

819
00:55:47.135 --> 00:55:51.473
And that's why your girlfriend is gonna be here any second to dump you.

820
00:55:51.473 --> 00:55:56.061
Because she knows what a pathetic. limp. little man you are-

821
00:55:56.061 --> 00:55:58.980
Just like Tom will. And just like your dad did.

822
00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:00.023
Where's dad?

823
00:56:00.023 --> 00:56:01.858
Where's dad? Anyone seen his dad?

824
00:56:01.858 --> 00:56:03.902
Where's dad?! Where's dad?!

825
00:56:05.528 --> 00:56:07.989
Leave me alone!

826
00:56:21.378 --> 00:56:22.629
Alex.

827
00:56:23.463 --> 00:56:24.547
Alex.

828
00:56:25.465 --> 00:56:26.549
Hey.

829
00:56:34.974 --> 00:56:36.976
Are you ok?

830
00:56:37.310 --> 00:56:38.144
What happened?

831
00:56:38.269 --> 00:56:39.062
Not sure.

832
00:56:39.312 --> 00:56:40.355
Ok. It's fine.

833
00:56:40.355 --> 00:56:41.314
I don't know what to do.

834
00:56:41.523 --> 00:56:43.400
Let's just take a minute.

835
00:56:46.569 --> 00:56:47.654
Tell me what happened.

836
00:56:49.864 --> 00:56:50.949
I was there.

837
00:56:52.617 --> 00:56:53.827
I was doing the lines.

838
00:56:53.827 --> 00:56:54.869
And they were going pretty well.

839
00:56:54.869 --> 00:56:57.414
And then... Just... Something...

840
00:56:58.832 --> 00:56:59.457
What?

841
00:57:00.959 --> 00:57:02.043
I was bad.

842
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:03.795
Bad how?

843
00:57:05.588 --> 00:57:06.673
I don't know.

844
00:57:07.841 --> 00:57:09.384
Off. Something was wrong. I don't know.

845
00:57:09.384 --> 00:57:10.385
Was it Tom?

846
00:57:10.385 --> 00:57:11.261
Yeah.

847
00:57:11.261 --> 00:57:12.178
Well. Both of them.

848
00:57:12.178 --> 00:57:13.054
Elliot.

849
00:57:13.054 --> 00:57:14.305
Yeah. Both of them.

850
00:57:14.305 --> 00:57:15.265
Didn't you get that?

851
00:57:16.141 --> 00:57:17.225
I was just checking.

852
00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:28.319
You know they aren't always right?

853
00:57:28.319 --> 00:57:30.363
It's just their opinion.

854
00:57:31.156 --> 00:57:33.783
And. in my opinion. I know you're gonna be great.

855
00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.705
Think about tomorrow night.

856
00:57:38.705 --> 00:57:39.289
Ok?

857
00:57:39.289 --> 00:57:42.250
The hard part will be over.

858
00:57:42.250 --> 00:57:43.793
Maybe we can go away over Easter.

859
00:57:44.335 --> 00:57:45.003
Yeah.

860
00:57:46.004 --> 00:57:46.546
Yeah?

861
00:57:47.463 --> 00:57:48.548
Doesn't that sound good?

862
00:57:48.798 --> 00:57:52.385
Yeah. I'm not sure how free I'm gonna be over Easter. though.

863
00:57:55.096 --> 00:57:57.557
Well. I can help with coursework.

864
00:57:57.974 --> 00:58:00.310
If that's what you're worried about.

865
00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:01.478
Yeah...

866
00:58:07.317 --> 00:58:11.154
Look. I could hear from Elliot at any moment

867
00:58:11.154 --> 00:58:12.739
After the play.

868
00:58:16.201 --> 00:58:16.993
Oh.

869
00:58:22.790 --> 00:58:23.875
So. then what?

870
00:58:26.127 --> 00:58:26.794
Well...

871
00:58:26.794 --> 00:58:27.462
What do you mean?

872
00:58:27.462 --> 00:58:29.339
After Elliot calls. then what?

873
00:58:30.590 --> 00:58:32.550
I guess I'd go wherever he needed me.

874
00:58:34.093 --> 00:58:37.639
Wherever. London. LA.

875
00:58:48.691 --> 00:58:49.442
Hey. You ok?

876
00:58:49.442 --> 00:58:50.610
Yeah.

877
00:58:51.319 --> 00:58:52.403
Um...

878
00:58:54.739 --> 00:58:55.823
Big decision.

879
00:58:55.949 --> 00:58:56.616
I know.

880
00:58:57.033 --> 00:58:57.659
Did you?

881
00:58:58.159 --> 00:58:58.701
Where...

882
00:58:58.910 --> 00:59:00.328
Do I fit into this?

883
00:59:01.454 --> 00:59:03.456
Well. You can come and see me between shows.

884
00:59:04.082 --> 00:59:05.541
Oh. So on your terms?

885
00:59:05.792 --> 00:59:07.794
My terms? You think that's what I want?

886
00:59:08.127 --> 00:59:09.212
Do you?

887
00:59:09.254 --> 00:59:10.713
You're reading too much into this.

888
00:59:10.964 --> 00:59:12.257
You understand how important this is.

889
00:59:12.257 --> 00:59:13.341
Yes. I do.

890
00:59:13.508 --> 00:59:14.592
I do.

891
00:59:14.634 --> 00:59:15.885
Out of everyone. I would know.

892
00:59:15.885 --> 00:59:16.719
Would you?

893
00:59:16.719 --> 00:59:18.221
Yeah. I mean it's all you talk about.

894
00:59:18.221 --> 00:59:19.222
Like. when?

895
00:59:19.222 --> 00:59:19.639
Everyday.

896
00:59:19.639 --> 00:59:20.890
Give me an example.

897
00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:23.142
Every night. You go off. Elliot this. the play that.

898
00:59:23.142 --> 00:59:23.726
I mean.

899
00:59:24.978 --> 00:59:26.563
What about me?

900
00:59:26.563 --> 00:59:27.480
You wouldn't understand.

901
00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:28.231
Do you ever talk to them about me?

902
00:59:28.231 --> 00:59:29.482
You don't get it.

903
00:59:29.482 --> 00:59:30.233
Yeah. I bet you don't.

904
00:59:30.233 --> 00:59:31.067
I do.

905
00:59:31.067 --> 00:59:31.985
Ok. So what wouldn't I get?

906
00:59:31.985 --> 00:59:34.237
Putting yourself out there. Taking a risk.

907
00:59:34.237 --> 00:59:36.406
I wish you could just be proud of yourself.

908
00:59:36.406 --> 00:59:37.615
The old you would have been.

909
00:59:37.615 --> 00:59:38.324
The old me?

910
00:59:38.324 --> 00:59:39.826
Yeah. Before Tom. Elliot. and the play.

911
00:59:39.826 --> 00:59:40.702
This has got nothing to do with them.

912
00:59:40.702 --> 00:59:42.036
Really? Are you that naive?

913
00:59:42.036 --> 00:59:44.330
Naive. Isn't this what you wanted? A poster boy.

914
00:59:44.330 --> 00:59:45.665
No. I didn't want this.

915
00:59:45.665 --> 00:59:47.875
You don't understand because you've always had it all.

916
00:59:47.875 --> 00:59:49.419
No. You don't know the slightest bit about me.

917
00:59:49.419 --> 00:59:50.086
I know enough.

918
00:59:50.086 --> 00:59:50.628
Which is?

919
00:59:50.628 --> 00:59:51.629
That you've never taken risk.

920
00:59:51.629 --> 00:59:53.047
It's a student play.

921
00:59:53.047 --> 00:59:54.340
You've never supported me.

922
00:59:54.340 --> 00:59:55.425
I done nothing but support you.

923
00:59:55.425 --> 00:59:56.801
Then why did you put me off the other night?

924
00:59:56.801 --> 00:59:57.302
Put you off?

925
00:59:57.302 --> 00:59:57.719
Do you want me to fail?

926
00:59:57.719 --> 00:59:58.177
Put you off?

927
00:59:58.177 --> 00:59:58.594
Yes.

928
00:59:58.594 --> 01:00:00.471
You mean. actually spend time with you.

929
01:00:00.471 --> 01:00:01.723
If you'd ever taken a risk. you'd understand.

930
01:00:01.723 --> 01:00:03.725
Well. I dated you didn't I?

931
01:00:03.725 --> 01:00:06.311
How is dating someone taking a risk? Are you that insecure?

932
01:00:06.311 --> 01:00:07.562
Insecure? You're an actor.

933
01:00:07.562 --> 01:00:08.313
I act for myself.

934
01:00:08.313 --> 01:00:09.272
Says every actor ever.

935
01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:09.897
Like you would know.

936
01:00:09.897 --> 01:00:10.732
Like you would know.

937
01:00:10.732 --> 01:00:11.316
You don't get it.

938
01:00:11.316 --> 01:00:11.983
No. Just get over it.

939
01:00:11.983 --> 01:00:12.567
Liv. Listen.

940
01:00:12.567 --> 01:00:13.276
I can't do this.

941
01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:13.693
This is me.

942
01:00:13.693 --> 01:00:14.360
No listen to me.

943
01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:14.986
I have to do this.

944
01:00:14.986 --> 01:00:15.945
Elliot's a liar.

945
01:00:15.945 --> 01:00:18.197
And you're too dumb to realise that if he was who he says he is

946
01:00:18.197 --> 01:00:21.200
He wouldn't take you on.

947
01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:22.952
No.

948
01:00:22.952 --> 01:00:25.204
Don't come tomorrow.

949
01:00:25.204 --> 01:00:27.373
It's an invite only preview.

950
01:00:27.373 --> 01:00:28.374
I wanna see the others.

951
01:00:28.374 --> 01:00:30.460
They're not your friends.

952
01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:31.252
Is Elliot one of those?

953
01:00:31.252 --> 01:00:31.878
Yeah.

954
01:00:31.878 --> 01:00:32.670
He gets me.

955
01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:34.297
Nobody knows who he is. Alex.

956
01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:35.048
What?

957
01:00:39.177 --> 01:00:41.763
You know what? I really didn't think you'd be like this.

958
01:01:53.459 --> 01:01:55.420
Name. Candidate Number.

959
01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:58.423
Alex Small. Candidate number 152.

960
01:02:37.837 --> 01:02:39.839
Got a call back.

961
01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:42.842
Done much acting before?

962
01:02:43.468 --> 01:02:45.845
Yeah. No. I actually-

963
01:02:45.845 --> 01:02:48.931
Sorry -- could I get a light?

964
01:02:53.561 --> 01:02:55.563
You alright?

965
01:02:56.397 --> 01:02:58.399
Yeah. Yeah. Fine.

966
01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:13.456
So you are Faustus?

967
01:03:14.123 --> 01:03:18.252
A modest actor. How strange.

968
01:03:27.011 --> 01:03:27.678
What's up?

969
01:03:27.678 --> 01:03:29.013
Doesn't matter.

970
01:04:27.113 --> 01:04:29.240
You know the reviews are out from yesterday?

971
01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:30.992
There were reviewers there yesterday?

972
01:04:30.992 --> 01:04:33.536
You know. most of them haven't been in plays before.

973
01:04:33.536 --> 01:04:35.871
Were they ok?

974
01:04:36.914 --> 01:04:39.834
These play reviewers. it's like letting me review a pair of skis.

975
01:04:39.834 --> 01:04:43.004
I don’t ski – I’ve never been but it looks easy with a bit of practice. Really can’t be that hard.

976
01:04:43.004 --> 01:04:43.796
To ski?

977
01:04:43.796 --> 01:04:44.380
To review.

978
01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:45.840
Right. Of course.

979
01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:48.259
So. what'd they say?

980
01:04:48.259 --> 01:04:50.386
The usual.

981
01:04:50.386 --> 01:04:53.639
We've been tweaking. Having my lead there would have helped.

982
01:04:53.639 --> 01:04:54.849
I should probably apologise to you for that.

983
01:04:54.849 --> 01:04:56.267
Please. You know I hate apologies.

984
01:04:56.267 --> 01:04:57.476
Like our first rehearsal?

985
01:04:57.476 --> 01:04:59.020
Wait. Do you not know why I did that to you guys?

986
01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:01.647
No? What was I meant to think?

987
01:05:01.647 --> 01:05:03.816
I guess...

988
01:05:05.568 --> 01:05:07.069
Exactly what you thought.

989
01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:08.154
You made Camille cry.

990
01:05:08.154 --> 01:05:08.571
And?

991
01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:09.405
Why would you do that?

992
01:05:11.490 --> 01:05:12.950
Why would you pick me for this?

993
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:15.745
You know... I had this music teacher at school

994
01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:18.122
Mr. Colburn. A real stickler.

995
01:05:18.122 --> 01:05:19.332
He practically bullied us.

996
01:05:19.332 --> 01:05:19.916
How's this relevant?

997
01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:21.584
Let me finish.

998
01:05:21.584 --> 01:05:25.588
One day I got in early. I saw him on the school field playing with his son. But he never called out to him.

999
01:05:25.588 --> 01:05:27.798
Didn't take me long to put together that he was deaf.

1000
01:05:27.798 --> 01:05:29.759
So. he took that out on you?

1001
01:05:29.759 --> 01:05:30.676
He can't do that.

1002
01:05:30.676 --> 01:05:32.094
Maybe he can't but he understood the process.

1003
01:05:32.094 --> 01:05:33.137
What process?

1004
01:05:33.137 --> 01:05:35.431
That he brought out the best in us because not in spite of his methods.

1005
01:05:35.431 --> 01:05:36.307
You're in denial. Tom.

1006
01:05:36.307 --> 01:05:38.225
No. Alex. Sometimes people don't know what's best for them.

1007
01:05:38.225 --> 01:05:40.102
Oh. And how does Camille fit into that?

1008
01:05:40.102 --> 01:05:41.520
Tom. They're here in five. hurry up!

1009
01:05:45.024 --> 01:05:47.401
You know what. Tom. you've done nothing but burden us from day one.

1010
01:05:47.401 --> 01:05:48.069
Alex!

1011
01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:48.903
And the way you stand there

1012
01:05:48.903 --> 01:05:49.195
Alex!

1013
01:05:49.195 --> 01:05:50.404
The way you hold yourself is a joke

1014
01:05:50.404 --> 01:05:51.864
Alex. They loved it.

1015
01:05:53.366 --> 01:05:55.826
I hear they might want us after yesterday.

1016
01:05:55.826 --> 01:05:56.994
I don't get it.

1017
01:05:56.994 --> 01:05:59.705
There's an offer on the table.

1018
01:05:59.705 --> 01:06:00.498
Ok?

1019
01:06:00.498 --> 01:06:01.666
But it has to be both of us.

1020
01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:05.753
We'd have to leave to start in two weeks. It's a last minute opening.

1021
01:06:05.753 --> 01:06:07.588
I won't do it.

1022
01:06:07.588 --> 01:06:08.464
What?

1023
01:06:08.464 --> 01:06:08.965
I won't do it.

1024
01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:09.590
Why?

1025
01:06:09.590 --> 01:06:10.424
Because I-

1026
01:06:10.424 --> 01:06:11.467
Why?

1027
01:06:11.467 --> 01:06:11.884
I won't-

1028
01:06:11.884 --> 01:06:12.301
Why?

1029
01:06:12.301 --> 01:06:12.718
Give me a reason

1030
01:06:12.718 --> 01:06:13.094
Tom

1031
01:06:13.094 --> 01:06:13.552
Alex. Give me an actual reason.

1032
01:06:13.552 --> 01:06:16.972
I won't do it for you.

1033
01:06:24.397 --> 01:06:26.148
Look where you are now.

1034
01:06:26.148 --> 01:06:27.191
That's not your doing.

1035
01:06:27.191 --> 01:06:28.651
Yes it is. You're just too close to realise it.

1036
01:06:28.651 --> 01:06:29.443
To realise what?

1037
01:06:29.443 --> 01:06:31.737
That we all want what's best for you.

1038
01:06:32.488 --> 01:06:34.699
All of us.

1039
01:07:10.651 --> 01:07:12.653
Lights on three.

1040
01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:26.876
I took a chance on you and it paid off.

1041
01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:29.336
Even after that ending. the reviewers loved you.

1042
01:07:29.336 --> 01:07:31.922
Does that make you feel any better?

1043
01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:56.572
Liv.

1044
01:07:58.991 --> 01:08:00.993
Yeah.

1045
01:08:18.219 --> 01:08:20.179
Does that give you the respect you crave?

1046
01:08:20.179 --> 01:08:22.890
Maybe it would have done at one point.

1047
01:08:22.890 --> 01:08:25.684
But now I don't know.

1048
01:08:25.684 --> 01:08:28.145
I just don't know.

1049
01:09:25.452 --> 01:09:27.454
Alex. What I...

1050
01:09:29.707 --> 01:09:31.709
What we...

1051
01:09:32.501 --> 01:09:34.503
Have made in you.

1052
01:09:34.753 --> 01:09:36.755
It's all been worth it.
