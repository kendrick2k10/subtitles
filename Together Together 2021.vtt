3
00:00:39.213 --> 00:00:40.823
Have you ever
stolen anything?

4
00:00:44.087 --> 00:00:45.132
No.

5
00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:47.134
Not really.

6
00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:55.838
Pens. I've stolen pens...

7
00:00:55.881 --> 00:00:57.013
Just pens.

8
00:00:59.276 --> 00:01:01.452
What's the worst thing
you've ever done?

9
00:01:04.803 --> 00:01:06.109
That's private.

10
00:01:07.241 --> 00:01:08.285
Mm.

11
00:01:11.854 --> 00:01:13.160
Are you religious?

12
00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:15.336
No.

13
00:01:15.379 --> 00:01:16.989
My family is.

14
00:01:18.339 --> 00:01:20.080
But. we're not close...

15
00:01:24.214 --> 00:01:25.694
This appeals to me

16
00:01:25.737 --> 00:01:27.522
because I know
it's not the best thing

17
00:01:27.565 --> 00:01:29.480
in the world being alone.

18
00:01:30.525 --> 00:01:33.658
Not that you are alone.

19
00:01:33.702 --> 00:01:36.270
But you are doing
this alone.

20
00:01:39.055 --> 00:01:40.752
Are you writing that down?

21
00:01:40.796 --> 00:01:43.364
I... I didn't mean like
"You are alone..."

22
00:01:43.407 --> 00:01:45.757
I meant. like. um...

23
00:01:45.801 --> 00:01:48.282
I don't think being alone
is a bad thing.

24
00:01:48.325 --> 00:01:50.153
I meant...

25
00:01:50.197 --> 00:01:52.199
if family is important
to someone.

26
00:01:52.242 --> 00:01:54.766
they should be open
and make one.

27
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.159
Plus the money.

28
00:01:56.203 --> 00:01:58.118
Not in a bad way.

29
00:02:00.555 --> 00:02:06.300
Um. and. you know. putting
a little bit karma in the bank

30
00:02:06.343 --> 00:02:08.258
never hurt anyone.

31
00:02:08.302 --> 00:02:10.173
Don't write down
the word "Karma".

32
00:02:10.217 --> 00:02:12.349
I'm sorry I use it. I regret it.

33
00:02:12.393 --> 00:02:15.613
-Hm.
-

34
00:02:15.657 --> 00:02:18.138
It says here
that you have a child.

35
00:02:18.181 --> 00:02:19.182
How old are they?

36
00:02:19.226 --> 00:02:20.227
Seven?

37
00:02:21.924 --> 00:02:23.404
Eight?

38
00:02:23.447 --> 00:02:24.666
Eight. I guess.

39
00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.755
You don't know
how old your own child is?

40
00:02:26.798 --> 00:02:30.498
He was adopted
like right after I had him

41
00:02:30.541 --> 00:02:33.065
and it was a closed adoption.

42
00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:34.458
Uh. I was in high school.

43
00:02:36.504 --> 00:02:37.548
Hm.

44
00:02:42.336 --> 00:02:43.685
Yeah.
I'm sorry. I just...

45
00:02:43.728 --> 00:02:45.687
I thought that
all the applicants had the...

46
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.473
either be raising children
or have raised them.

47
00:02:49.517 --> 00:02:51.562
I think technically
the requirement

48
00:02:51.606 --> 00:02:54.478
is that "you have
to have had a kid..."

49
00:02:55.827 --> 00:02:58.874
which I... have.

50
00:02:58.917 --> 00:03:00.354
Right. Right.

51
00:03:00.397 --> 00:03:05.141
I won't be offended if that is
a deal-breaker for you

52
00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:08.579
but I do know what it's like
to carry a baby

53
00:03:08.623 --> 00:03:10.320
and then give one up.

54
00:03:10.364 --> 00:03:15.499
And this wouldn't be mine
this time.

55
00:03:15.543 --> 00:03:17.414
like this one
wouldn't even be mine.

56
00:03:17.458 --> 00:03:20.417
Baby is. uh. if anything
it would be easier.

57
00:03:23.507 --> 00:03:26.423
I. uh. I have some questions
for you. if that's okay.

58
00:03:26.467 --> 00:03:28.338
I actually wrote them down.

59
00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.734
What's the worst thing
you've ever done?

60
00:03:32.777 --> 00:03:33.865
Oh...

61
00:03:45.268 --> 00:03:47.488
Hey.
Oh. is anyone clothed?

62
00:03:47.531 --> 00:03:49.272
Everyone's clothed.

63
00:03:49.316 --> 00:03:51.013
Sorry. I mean unclothed.

64
00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:54.843
-Uh. come on in.
- Okay.

65
00:03:54.886 --> 00:03:56.236
Hey.

66
00:03:56.279 --> 00:03:57.367
-Hi. sorry. whoa...
- Hello.

67
00:03:57.411 --> 00:03:58.629
...it took me so long.

68
00:03:58.673 --> 00:04:00.849
Hey. I ran the whole way here.

69
00:04:00.892 --> 00:04:04.809
Okay. Hi. Matt. Uh. everything
is going very well.

70
00:04:04.853 --> 00:04:07.551
Her HCG levels is strong.

71
00:04:07.595 --> 00:04:10.685
normal doubling. progesterone
is right on schedule.

72
00:04:10.728 --> 00:04:13.296
So. all in all.
it's all very good news.

73
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.994
on paper. this is
a very viable pregnancy...

74
00:04:16.952 --> 00:04:18.170
Third time is a charm.

75
00:04:18.214 --> 00:04:19.650
Well.
we can't be sure yet.

76
00:04:19.694 --> 00:04:22.697
so we'll just. uh.
do our best and wait.

77
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.003
Sure. but I mean so far so good.

78
00:04:25.047 --> 00:04:26.744
So far so good.

79
00:04:26.788 --> 00:04:28.137
Congratulations.

80
00:04:29.617 --> 00:04:33.664
That's. uh... That's
our first congratulations.

81
00:04:33.708 --> 00:04:36.232
Oh. God. so thank you...
Thank you for that.

82
00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:38.843
-Yay!
-

83
00:04:38.887 --> 00:04:41.106
Okay. Well. call me
if you need anything. Anna.

84
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.153
And. um. I'll see you both
in a few weeks.

85
00:04:44.196 --> 00:04:45.241
Thank you.

86
00:04:46.111 --> 00:04:47.199
Bye.

87
00:04:50.333 --> 00:04:51.682
Uh. you did it.

88
00:04:52.988 --> 00:04:55.686
Yeah. We live.

89
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.559
It's. uh. great job in there.

90
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.608
Are you coming?

91
00:05:04.652 --> 00:05:06.262
Yes. Yeah. yeah.

92
00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:08.308
Um. are you... How...

93
00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:09.700
Like. how are you feeling?

94
00:05:10.658 --> 00:05:12.573
Um...

95
00:05:12.616 --> 00:05:15.750
I feel regular. Normal.

96
00:05:15.793 --> 00:05:17.969
Okay. good.
That's good. Normal is good.

97
00:05:18.013 --> 00:05:20.320
That's... that's what you want.

98
00:05:20.363 --> 00:05:22.365
Uh. how are...
How are you feeling?

99
00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:25.237
Also good and normal

100
00:05:25.281 --> 00:05:28.719
and... uh. amazed.

101
00:05:28.763 --> 00:05:29.764
That's good.

102
00:05:29.807 --> 00:05:31.200
Yeah. I... I. uh...

103
00:05:31.243 --> 00:05:32.636
I mean this is happening.

104
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.159
So far. yeah.

105
00:05:34.203 --> 00:05:36.988
Yeah. but. um. by the way...

106
00:05:37.032 --> 00:05:38.120
I got you this.

107
00:05:38.642 --> 00:05:40.209
Oh...

108
00:05:40.252 --> 00:05:42.211
Um... thank you.

109
00:05:42.254 --> 00:05:43.430
Um...

110
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.390
Is... is this for the baby?

111
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.175
Yeah.

112
00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:51.786
Then maybe you should keep it.

113
00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:53.353
-Right? Yes. of course.
-Yeah.

114
00:05:53.396 --> 00:05:54.397
-Um... Yeah.
-Okay.

115
00:05:54.441 --> 00:05:56.356
Uh. can we just
maybe get dinner?

116
00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:59.097
Like a... a just
a little celebration?

117
00:05:59.141 --> 00:06:01.448
Yeah. Okay. thank you.

118
00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:03.624
Yeah. Cool.
-Um...

119
00:06:03.667 --> 00:06:05.669
I have to run right now.
or I'm gonna be late.

120
00:06:05.713 --> 00:06:07.932
-So. I'll call you? Yes?
- Okay. perfect. Yeah.

121
00:06:07.976 --> 00:06:09.194
Bye.
-Bye.

122
00:06:21.685 --> 00:06:22.947
Well. this is great.

123
00:06:22.991 --> 00:06:24.775
-This is great.
-

124
00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:28.126
-There you go. So...
-Oh.

125
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.086
-So. yeah...

126
00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:32.653
-Crazy nervous.
-Yep.

127
00:06:32.696 --> 00:06:35.351
But also insanely excited.

128
00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:36.787
You do it again.

129
00:06:36.831 --> 00:06:38.180
Oh-oh.
-Good.

130
00:06:39.616 --> 00:06:42.706
Just feels like the right time.

131
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.492
Um... if you're happy.
we're happy.

132
00:06:46.493 --> 00:06:48.320
Let's... how about a toast?

133
00:06:48.364 --> 00:06:49.496
-Huh...
-All right.

134
00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:51.411
-

135
00:06:51.454 --> 00:06:52.455
Um...

136
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:54.501
To...

137
00:06:57.242 --> 00:06:58.679
Uh... To...

138
00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:04.815
-...life...

139
00:07:06.643 --> 00:07:08.776
-Yes! Yes. to life!
-Yeah. To life!

140
00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:10.647
-Family.
-Baby.

141
00:07:10.691 --> 00:07:12.432
Guys. you are about
to have a baby cousin.

142
00:07:12.475 --> 00:07:13.476
Baby.

143
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.564
-Yeah. baby.
-Yeah!

144
00:07:14.608 --> 00:07:15.652
Baby!

145
00:07:15.696 --> 00:07:17.175
-Baby.
- My baby...

146
00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:20.265
Uh. it's not your baby.
Um. it's my baby.

147
00:07:21.702 --> 00:07:22.833
Um...

148
00:07:22.877 --> 00:07:24.052
-

149
00:07:24.095 --> 00:07:26.054
-What did Mom and Dad say?
- Uh...

150
00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.361
Mom. Dad...

151
00:07:31.102 --> 00:07:33.540
I have some
very exciting news...

152
00:07:34.715 --> 00:07:36.499
Where did you get that.
did you find it?

153
00:07:36.543 --> 00:07:37.718
I'm pregnant.

154
00:07:39.894 --> 00:07:41.330
I mean the surrogate
is pregnant.

155
00:07:41.373 --> 00:07:43.724
Did you drive with
an open container in your car?

156
00:07:43.767 --> 00:07:45.073
You're not supposed to do that.

157
00:07:45.116 --> 00:07:46.466
I believe
he's trying to tell us

158
00:07:46.509 --> 00:07:47.728
that he's gonna be a father.

159
00:07:47.771 --> 00:07:49.599
Well. that's not
a very fatherly thing to do.

160
00:07:49.643 --> 00:07:50.992
Driving with an open container.

161
00:07:51.035 --> 00:07:53.037
It's tough to raise a kid.

162
00:07:53.081 --> 00:07:54.474
It takes two people
to make a baby

163
00:07:54.517 --> 00:07:56.214
because it takes two people
to raise a baby.

164
00:07:56.258 --> 00:07:57.433
I... I kind of think
we're past the point

165
00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:59.130
of debate on this. you know.

166
00:07:59.174 --> 00:08:01.393
Let's... let's try
and embrace the future.

167
00:08:01.437 --> 00:08:02.482
Thank you.

168
00:08:02.525 --> 00:08:03.744
It's actually happening.

169
00:08:03.787 --> 00:08:05.702
That's great. my boy.

170
00:08:05.746 --> 00:08:06.834
It is great.

171
00:08:09.184 --> 00:08:10.185
Mom?

172
00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:12.927
What's the deal
on this surrogate.

173
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:14.363
I forget is she single?

174
00:08:15.451 --> 00:08:19.194
So. you design apps?

175
00:08:19.237 --> 00:08:21.022
Correct. yep.

176
00:08:21.065 --> 00:08:22.632
Is that fun?

177
00:08:23.851 --> 00:08:25.287
Sorry. just...

178
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:30.771
I am a little nervous.

179
00:08:31.598 --> 00:08:33.077
About being a dad?

180
00:08:33.121 --> 00:08:34.949
No. uh. yes that.

181
00:08:34.992 --> 00:08:37.299
but I've thought a lot more
about being a dad

182
00:08:37.342 --> 00:08:39.562
than I've thought about. um...

183
00:08:39.606 --> 00:08:40.650
...making conversation

184
00:08:40.694 --> 00:08:42.913
with the person
carrying my baby.

185
00:08:42.957 --> 00:08:45.873
Right.
Well. I'm nervous too so...

186
00:08:47.352 --> 00:08:49.224
Wait...

187
00:08:49.267 --> 00:08:51.574
You're not gonna change
your mind. are you?

188
00:08:51.618 --> 00:08:53.489
Oh. no.
I meant I'm nervous about.

189
00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:55.317
uh. making conversation.

190
00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.275
Yeah. Good. Okay.

191
00:08:57.972 --> 00:08:59.277
Good.

192
00:08:59.321 --> 00:09:00.801
'Cause I don't think
you can change your mind

193
00:09:00.844 --> 00:09:03.804
at this point. anyway. Legally.

194
00:09:03.847 --> 00:09:07.547
I mean not. not that the laws
rule your body.

195
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.593
It's your body.
You can do whatever you want.

196
00:09:10.637 --> 00:09:12.073
Well. you don't even need me
to say that.

197
00:09:12.116 --> 00:09:13.901
I don't... You don't need
my permission to do.

198
00:09:13.944 --> 00:09:15.250
It's women's right. All of it.

199
00:09:15.293 --> 00:09:16.817
I am pro everything.

200
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.340
Unless you're pro-life.

201
00:09:18.383 --> 00:09:22.257
And... and pro-choiceness
offends you in which case...

202
00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.520
Does pro-choiceness offend you?

203
00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:26.653
Why would pro-choiceness
offend me?

204
00:09:26.696 --> 00:09:28.916
Well. because you...
Uh. you had a baby so young

205
00:09:28.959 --> 00:09:30.178
and then you gave it up.

206
00:09:31.396 --> 00:09:32.528
So you...

207
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.575
obviously didn't wanna
have a child

208
00:09:35.618 --> 00:09:38.969
but you still actually...

209
00:09:39.013 --> 00:09:43.408
follow through it. uh.
with. you know. having.

210
00:09:45.236 --> 00:09:48.675
I don't think giving up
a baby for adoption

211
00:09:48.718 --> 00:09:50.546
makes someone pro-life.

212
00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:51.721
Neither do I.

213
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.161
Hm.

214
00:10:02.123 --> 00:10:06.606
So to Anna. so far so good.

215
00:10:06.649 --> 00:10:11.698
Uh. and to Matt and. um. wait.
wait. who's egg is it again?

216
00:10:11.741 --> 00:10:13.874
Donor 45883.

217
00:10:13.917 --> 00:10:15.092
To Matt's sperm

218
00:10:15.136 --> 00:10:18.313
-and donor 45883.
- Wait!

219
00:10:18.356 --> 00:10:20.141
-I'm giving the toast.
-Okay.

220
00:10:20.184 --> 00:10:23.013
To my sperm. to the donor's egg.

221
00:10:23.057 --> 00:10:25.537
and to Anna's uterus.

222
00:10:25.581 --> 00:10:26.626
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

223
00:10:32.196 --> 00:10:36.070
-Hi. Have you decided?
-Uh. yeah. um...

224
00:10:36.113 --> 00:10:39.464
Can I get. uh.
free-range chicken pesto thing?

225
00:10:39.508 --> 00:10:41.858
And would you like
fried potato or salad?

226
00:10:41.902 --> 00:10:43.425
Uh. potato.

227
00:10:43.468 --> 00:10:45.732
Mm. Mm-mm.

228
00:10:51.259 --> 00:10:52.782
A salad.

229
00:10:52.826 --> 00:10:54.784
Mm-hm.

230
00:10:54.828 --> 00:10:56.438
And potato. please.

231
00:10:57.308 --> 00:10:58.701
And for you?

232
00:10:58.745 --> 00:11:01.704
-Carbonara.
- Well...

233
00:11:01.748 --> 00:11:04.228
I'm lot less nervous.
uh. after the...

234
00:11:05.577 --> 00:11:07.492
You know what?
I'm sorry. I just was worried

235
00:11:07.536 --> 00:11:09.190
when you order potatoes

236
00:11:09.233 --> 00:11:10.800
because...

237
00:11:10.844 --> 00:11:14.064
...what you eat. it eat.
They eat.

238
00:11:14.108 --> 00:11:16.501
You ordered pasta with bacon.

239
00:11:16.545 --> 00:11:18.155
Yeah. but I'm the only one
eating it.

240
00:11:18.199 --> 00:11:23.291
But I only matter for like
the next like nine months or so.

241
00:11:23.334 --> 00:11:28.470
And you matter
for the next 18 plus years.

242
00:11:28.513 --> 00:11:30.777
I feel like
you're 40 something so...

243
00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:34.737
yeah. if I were you I would not
eat pasta with bacon.

244
00:11:34.781 --> 00:11:35.869
Hmm.

245
00:11:37.261 --> 00:11:40.221
That's a really good point.
actually.

246
00:11:40.264 --> 00:11:42.702
So why didn't you make
a weird sound when I ordered it.

247
00:11:42.745 --> 00:11:45.313
Because I am not annoying.

248
00:11:45.356 --> 00:11:48.403
And I'm pro-choice.

249
00:11:48.446 --> 00:11:51.362
I see here that
the placenta has formed.

250
00:11:51.406 --> 00:11:52.712
And that's great.

251
00:11:52.755 --> 00:11:54.539
How do you feel about that?

252
00:11:54.583 --> 00:11:57.107
It's exciting. Um...

253
00:11:57.151 --> 00:11:59.153
Were almost in the clear.
you know.

254
00:11:59.196 --> 00:12:00.458
to start telling people.

255
00:12:00.502 --> 00:12:03.287
I'm dying to tell people.

256
00:12:03.331 --> 00:12:04.462
I've already told
a couple of people

257
00:12:04.506 --> 00:12:06.813
but like I wanna tell everybody.

258
00:12:06.856 --> 00:12:09.032
And what about you. Anna?

259
00:12:09.076 --> 00:12:11.513
I'm not going to tell anybody.

260
00:12:11.556 --> 00:12:13.210
I meant
how are you feeling.

261
00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.430
Oh. uh. good.

262
00:12:15.473 --> 00:12:18.868
I am tired.
not zombie-tired yet.

263
00:12:18.912 --> 00:12:20.696
but I feel healthy.

264
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.002
Good.

265
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.483
I'm sorry.
You're not gonna tell anyone?

266
00:12:26.049 --> 00:12:27.050
No.

267
00:12:28.835 --> 00:12:30.793
Uh. well.
I... I probably should tell

268
00:12:30.837 --> 00:12:32.360
my boss at some point.

269
00:12:32.403 --> 00:12:33.796
And that's important because

270
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.580
because you'll have to arrange
for maternity leave.

271
00:12:35.624 --> 00:12:36.668
Really?

272
00:12:36.712 --> 00:12:38.235
But I'm not maternal.

273
00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:40.455
Maternity leave isn't just
for the baby.

274
00:12:40.498 --> 00:12:41.891
it's also for the woman.

275
00:12:42.544 --> 00:12:43.806
Oh. okay.

276
00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:45.677
So you're not gonna tell anyone?

277
00:12:45.721 --> 00:12:46.722
No.

278
00:12:47.244 --> 00:12:48.855
Why not?

279
00:12:48.898 --> 00:12:52.510
I don't know.
It's temporary. And private.

280
00:12:52.554 --> 00:12:54.077
But you're gonna
start showing.

281
00:12:54.121 --> 00:12:56.036
It will be obvious
that you're pregnant. Right?

282
00:12:56.079 --> 00:12:57.211
I know. I'm not...

283
00:12:57.254 --> 00:12:58.603
I didn't say
I was trying to hide it.

284
00:12:58.647 --> 00:12:59.909
I just don't have anyone

285
00:12:59.953 --> 00:13:02.912
that I really need
to "share the news" with.

286
00:13:02.956 --> 00:13:05.610
-Not your parents or...
-No.

287
00:13:06.873 --> 00:13:08.875
Does that bother you. Matt?

288
00:13:08.918 --> 00:13:14.141
I guess I just thought that. uh.
she would tell more people.

289
00:13:14.184 --> 00:13:18.623
And how do you feel knowing
that she's not?

290
00:13:18.667 --> 00:13:20.451
I don't know. Um...

291
00:13:20.495 --> 00:13:23.063
I mean it's her choice.
obviously.

292
00:13:23.106 --> 00:13:25.065
And I'm very pro-choices.

293
00:13:25.108 --> 00:13:26.631
So is she. For the record.

294
00:13:28.329 --> 00:13:29.417
Great.

295
00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.941
I'm... I... I just...

296
00:13:31.985 --> 00:13:35.075
Am I supposed to act like I'm...
like not here

297
00:13:35.118 --> 00:13:37.817
when you guys talk
about me like that?

298
00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:41.690
Or... I've. I've just never
done this before.

299
00:13:41.733 --> 00:13:44.475
It's... whatever
you're comfortable with.

300
00:13:55.573 --> 00:13:59.186
I'm sorry.
am I supposed to wait until...

301
00:13:59.229 --> 00:14:01.579
she decide what she's
comfortable with before...

302
00:14:02.798 --> 00:14:05.105
I keep talking about her?

303
00:14:05.148 --> 00:14:06.584
That's up to you.

304
00:14:21.338 --> 00:14:24.602
Okay. well. uh...

305
00:14:24.646 --> 00:14:27.127
Um. you want a bite?

306
00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:29.869
No. thank you. It's okay.

307
00:14:34.003 --> 00:14:36.919
I went to couples therapy
once before with my ex.

308
00:14:36.963 --> 00:14:39.095
-Wife?
-No. Just a regular ex.

309
00:14:42.142 --> 00:14:44.840
Afterwards.
we come outside and...

310
00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:46.581
hold hands and eat candy.

311
00:14:46.624 --> 00:14:48.017
That sounds nice.

312
00:14:48.061 --> 00:14:49.584
It was nice.

313
00:14:49.627 --> 00:14:52.065
Then we go home and continue
not sleeping together.

314
00:15:49.078 --> 00:15:51.863
I don't wanna be a B. but that's
your third croissant today.

315
00:15:54.344 --> 00:15:56.085
And?

316
00:15:56.129 --> 00:15:59.610
And I'm not being judgmental
but they really are bad for you.

317
00:16:01.264 --> 00:16:02.526
So you're judging?

318
00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:04.398
No. I just said I'm not judging.

319
00:16:07.183 --> 00:16:09.185
That doesn't mean anything.

320
00:16:09.229 --> 00:16:12.449
I'm dating two people named Sam.
How could I be judgmental?

321
00:16:12.493 --> 00:16:15.409
I'm hungry
and I wanna eat salty bread.

322
00:16:15.452 --> 00:16:17.541
Okay. but did you read
that thing about how Cosco

323
00:16:17.585 --> 00:16:20.370
puts chemicals on those things.
azodicarbonamide.

324
00:16:20.414 --> 00:16:22.938
They put that in yoga mats
and fake leather.

325
00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:25.027
It's really bad for you.

326
00:16:25.071 --> 00:16:27.290
But... it's in yoga mats.

327
00:16:27.334 --> 00:16:30.032
And fake leather.

328
00:16:31.294 --> 00:16:33.644
Are these from Cosco?

329
00:16:33.688 --> 00:16:37.387
I mean I don't know.
but Nestlé owns Maybelline

330
00:16:37.431 --> 00:16:38.998
and that's not even a food.

331
00:16:39.041 --> 00:16:40.912
Like Nestlé is in everywhere.

332
00:16:40.956 --> 00:16:42.436
Okay.

333
00:16:42.479 --> 00:16:45.134
I feel like we should just
pack up and go home.

334
00:16:47.876 --> 00:16:48.877
What?

335
00:16:52.272 --> 00:16:54.013
-Hi.
- Hey.

336
00:16:54.056 --> 00:16:55.623
What are you doing here?

337
00:16:55.666 --> 00:16:58.800
Well. I was in the neighborhood
and so I brought you some tea.

338
00:16:58.843 --> 00:17:02.021
That's nice. We have a ton
of tea here. It's a coffee shop.

339
00:17:02.064 --> 00:17:03.239
You don't have this.

340
00:17:03.283 --> 00:17:06.808
This is a special pregnancy tea.

341
00:17:06.851 --> 00:17:08.636
Can you not use that word
around here. please?

342
00:17:08.679 --> 00:17:10.638
I'm sorry. yes. of course.

343
00:17:10.681 --> 00:17:13.467
I just saw in the log
that it's been kinda tough week.

344
00:17:14.337 --> 00:17:15.512
Thank you.

345
00:17:16.557 --> 00:17:18.167
And I also brought you these.

346
00:17:21.518 --> 00:17:22.650
Clogs?

347
00:17:22.693 --> 00:17:24.130
Yeah.

348
00:17:24.173 --> 00:17:26.915
I mean if you're gonna be
on your feet all day...

349
00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:28.090
and your...

350
00:17:28.134 --> 00:17:29.526
You're gonna what?

351
00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:30.658
Better arch support.

352
00:17:30.701 --> 00:17:32.747
I'm. I'm barely...

353
00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:35.663
...so. uh. I don't think
I need special shoes.

354
00:17:35.706 --> 00:17:37.360
You know nurses wear this.
right?

355
00:17:37.404 --> 00:17:38.622
I know.

356
00:17:38.666 --> 00:17:40.276
Did you know
that artists wear this?

357
00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:44.106
Like a lot of collage artists.
ceramicists.

358
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:46.456
They're cool. like.
people think these are cool now.

359
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.459
I think this is so sweet.

360
00:17:49.503 --> 00:17:51.418
I'm just gonna stick
to my normal shoes.

361
00:17:51.461 --> 00:17:54.160
Fair enough. I'll just hold on
to them until you need them.

362
00:17:54.203 --> 00:17:55.335
Which I won't.

363
00:17:55.378 --> 00:17:58.338
So many blogs say
that you will so...

364
00:17:58.381 --> 00:18:00.035
I'll hold on to them.
It's all good.

365
00:18:00.818 --> 00:18:02.907
Ew. Whose clogs?

366
00:18:02.951 --> 00:18:05.475
No one's.
They're no one's clogs.

367
00:18:07.129 --> 00:18:08.217
I'm Matt.

368
00:18:10.785 --> 00:18:15.094
Um... apropos of nothing. Uh...

369
00:18:15.137 --> 00:18:16.617
You sure
I can't return clogs here?

370
00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.314
Okay. well.
do you have a receipt?

371
00:18:18.358 --> 00:18:19.663
-No.
-Oh.

372
00:18:19.707 --> 00:18:22.144
We can't process to return
on a pair of shoes.

373
00:18:22.188 --> 00:18:23.754
I feel... I mean
if you have a receipt.

374
00:18:23.798 --> 00:18:25.191
I feel like it's fair.

375
00:18:25.234 --> 00:18:26.627
It's like Starbucks.
You go there with the receipt

376
00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:28.281
and they... and they'll.
they'll return.

377
00:18:28.324 --> 00:18:30.065
Anything from anywhere.

378
00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:31.936
Thank you. stranger.

379
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.896
for helping me
in this coffee shop.

380
00:18:35.375 --> 00:18:37.203
Um... bye.

381
00:18:37.899 --> 00:18:38.900
Bye.

382
00:18:40.771 --> 00:18:42.686
A girl in my Bio-Chem
wears clogs

383
00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.167
and I've never seen her smile
ever in my life.

384
00:19:04.839 --> 00:19:06.841
Hey. sorry. Hi.

385
00:19:06.884 --> 00:19:08.451
Uh. what. what are you...

386
00:19:08.495 --> 00:19:10.497
I thought that we were. uh.
meeting at the doctor.

387
00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:11.846
We are.

388
00:19:11.889 --> 00:19:14.283
Uh. I just thought
I would bring you this here

389
00:19:14.327 --> 00:19:15.850
in case you didn't take them
at work

390
00:19:15.893 --> 00:19:18.548
because you didn't wanna reveal
that you're pregnant.

391
00:19:18.592 --> 00:19:20.985
And then I didn't wanna bring
them to the doctor because...

392
00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:23.336
then you don't have to
carry them around all day so...

393
00:19:23.379 --> 00:19:25.773
But I. I really don't want them.

394
00:19:25.816 --> 00:19:28.297
Hey. sorry. uh.
your bathroom door sticks.

395
00:19:28.341 --> 00:19:30.038
I know. uh...

396
00:19:30.081 --> 00:19:31.126
Hey. man.

397
00:19:33.433 --> 00:19:34.521
Hey. man.

398
00:19:34.564 --> 00:19:36.218
-I'm Matt.
-Bryce.

399
00:19:40.222 --> 00:19:42.224
-So you guys just do it or...
-Matt!

400
00:19:42.268 --> 00:19:43.399
Oh. who is this guy?

401
00:19:43.443 --> 00:19:44.661
-You can't do that.
-Says who?

402
00:19:44.705 --> 00:19:46.185
Are you like her uncle
or something?

403
00:19:46.228 --> 00:19:47.490
No.
-No. I'm not her uncle.

404
00:19:47.534 --> 00:19:49.057
I'm the father.

405
00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.407
-Oh. my God. you're the father?
-No. I'm not her dad.

406
00:19:51.451 --> 00:19:53.148
We work together.

407
00:19:53.192 --> 00:19:55.106
Well. whatever.
good luck with that.

408
00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:56.369
Yeah.

409
00:19:56.412 --> 00:19:58.458
Lemme know...
Lemme know about Thursday...

410
00:19:58.501 --> 00:19:59.502
Yep.

411
00:20:05.813 --> 00:20:07.467
Oh. what's on Thursday?

412
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:08.990
What are you doing?

413
00:20:09.033 --> 00:20:10.861
-What. what are you doing?
-Nothing.

414
00:20:10.905 --> 00:20:12.341
I didn't know
you had a boyfriend.

415
00:20:12.385 --> 00:20:14.300
I feel like I should have
come up in the interview.

416
00:20:14.343 --> 00:20:15.692
I don't have a boyfriend.

417
00:20:15.736 --> 00:20:17.216
Well then. who is that...

418
00:20:18.652 --> 00:20:20.393
You just hooked up
with that guy?

419
00:20:22.351 --> 00:20:24.179
So...
Are there multiple "Bryces"?

420
00:20:24.223 --> 00:20:26.094
Are you mad about the clogs?

421
00:20:26.137 --> 00:20:28.227
I'm not mad about the clogs.
I just...

422
00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:31.055
I'm mad because there was
a random penis

423
00:20:31.099 --> 00:20:32.535
really close to my unborn baby.

424
00:20:32.579 --> 00:20:37.323
You do know that the baby
is not like in my vagina?

425
00:20:38.541 --> 00:20:40.239
Yeah.

426
00:20:40.282 --> 00:20:43.285
The baby comes out
of the vagina.

427
00:20:43.329 --> 00:20:45.200
Stop saying vagina.

428
00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:49.639
I wasn't able to have sex at all
surrounding implantation.

429
00:20:49.683 --> 00:20:53.295
and soon I'm going
to be visibly pregnant

430
00:20:53.339 --> 00:20:57.081
and that will hinder
my opportunity to do that.

431
00:20:57.125 --> 00:21:02.043
So you cannot tell me not
to have sex for a year. okay?

432
00:21:02.086 --> 00:21:04.263
The married surrogates.

433
00:21:04.306 --> 00:21:05.438
they have sex
with their husbands.

434
00:21:05.481 --> 00:21:06.656
-right?
-

435
00:21:07.918 --> 00:21:09.877
Sorry about that.

436
00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.313
-Now we're ready.
- Mm-hm.

437
00:21:14.577 --> 00:21:16.013
Scoot down. please.

438
00:21:18.233 --> 00:21:19.278
Scoot a little more.

439
00:21:21.062 --> 00:21:22.933
And if you could scoot
some more. please.

440
00:21:23.673 --> 00:21:25.022
Scoot down just a bit.

441
00:21:27.373 --> 00:21:28.765
Scoot.

442
00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:30.811
Perfect.

443
00:21:31.986 --> 00:21:33.422
Oh. what is... What's...

444
00:21:33.466 --> 00:21:35.163
Hm. what's that?

445
00:21:35.206 --> 00:21:37.121
This is an internal ultrasound.

446
00:21:38.427 --> 00:21:39.472
Oh.

447
00:21:40.473 --> 00:21:41.691
I. um...

448
00:21:41.735 --> 00:21:44.738
Oh. um...
I'm just gonna turn around.

449
00:21:46.217 --> 00:21:47.784
-Hm.
-Ready?

450
00:21:47.828 --> 00:21:50.483
You gonna feel
a little pressure. okay.

451
00:21:50.526 --> 00:21:52.659
Press on your right ovary
for me.

452
00:21:55.052 --> 00:21:57.316
By the way. uh.
pretty sure people

453
00:21:57.359 --> 00:21:58.752
actually have sex
to induce labor.

454
00:21:58.795 --> 00:21:59.840
Other side.

455
00:21:59.883 --> 00:22:00.928
Yeah. I think they do that

456
00:22:00.971 --> 00:22:02.364
at the very end
of the pregnancy.

457
00:22:02.408 --> 00:22:04.410
not two months in.

458
00:22:04.453 --> 00:22:06.237
Oh. wait. what do you think
by the way I...

459
00:22:06.281 --> 00:22:07.543
I'm just a technician.

460
00:22:07.587 --> 00:22:10.372
I'm not allowed to say anything
about anything.

461
00:22:10.416 --> 00:22:13.244
-Off the record?
- Off the record.

462
00:22:13.288 --> 00:22:16.204
it is more than fine to have sex
when you're pregnant.

463
00:22:16.247 --> 00:22:19.250
Okay. but I mean
she's just a technician.

464
00:22:19.294 --> 00:22:21.252
-What does she know?
- I know everything.

465
00:22:21.296 --> 00:22:22.732
I'm just not allowed to say it.

466
00:22:23.385 --> 00:22:24.430
See?

467
00:22:24.473 --> 00:22:25.822
A lot of Dads
go through this.

468
00:22:25.866 --> 00:22:27.389
they start to see their wives
as precious

469
00:22:27.433 --> 00:22:30.697
and sacred and fragile
as soon as they get pregnant.

470
00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.439
-But they are the same woman.
-

471
00:22:33.482 --> 00:22:34.527
You can have sex.

472
00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:36.355
Oh. not... not with him.

473
00:22:36.398 --> 00:22:38.008
I don't...
-She wants to have sex

474
00:22:38.052 --> 00:22:39.445
which is very understandable

475
00:22:39.488 --> 00:22:43.013
but like my baby is in there...

476
00:22:43.057 --> 00:22:45.712
-absorbing ejaculate...
-I use protection.

477
00:22:45.755 --> 00:22:48.541
Yeah. but there's thrusting.
grunting...

478
00:22:48.584 --> 00:22:50.456
There's God knows what else

479
00:22:50.499 --> 00:22:53.676
-with God knows who else.
- I "date" and...

480
00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.810
I would like to do that
while I can

481
00:22:56.853 --> 00:22:59.595
before my vagina
is in full recovery.

482
00:22:59.639 --> 00:23:01.249
Did you guys want to hear
the heartbeat?

483
00:23:01.292 --> 00:23:04.078
Or should we wait
for this dispute to settle?

484
00:23:04.121 --> 00:23:05.732
There's a heartbeat?

485
00:23:05.775 --> 00:23:07.821
-

486
00:23:10.476 --> 00:23:12.347
It's... it's alive!

487
00:23:15.263 --> 00:23:17.613
It's alive.

488
00:23:17.657 --> 00:23:19.572
So you heard the heartbeat?

489
00:23:19.615 --> 00:23:21.443
That's a really exciting moment.

490
00:23:21.487 --> 00:23:23.402
especially
for first-time parent.

491
00:23:23.445 --> 00:23:25.360
Very exciting.

492
00:23:25.404 --> 00:23:30.452
I mean I just... I wanna hear
that sound all the time.

493
00:23:30.496 --> 00:23:33.063
I mean
is there an app for that?

494
00:23:33.107 --> 00:23:34.674
There should be an app for that.

495
00:23:34.717 --> 00:23:36.153
And Anna. what about...

496
00:23:36.197 --> 00:23:39.026
What about you.
how was that experience for you?

497
00:23:39.069 --> 00:23:41.071
It was great. It was...
It was fine.

498
00:23:41.115 --> 00:23:44.292
Um...
It's nice to see Matt so happy.

499
00:23:45.336 --> 00:23:47.556
Well. you were happy too.

500
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.558
Yeah. totally.
That's what she said.

501
00:23:49.602 --> 00:23:51.560
said it was nice
to see you so happy.

502
00:23:53.257 --> 00:23:54.607
Thank you.

503
00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:58.437
Um. had there been any conflicts
that have come up?

504
00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.351
Um. aside from the clogs?

505
00:24:02.919 --> 00:24:04.486
Oh. here's something.

506
00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:06.357
"Furthermore.
the surrogate agrees

507
00:24:06.401 --> 00:24:08.011
not to engage in strenuous

508
00:24:08.055 --> 00:24:11.798
or high-risk activity including
but not limited to skydiving.

509
00:24:11.841 --> 00:24:13.843
contact sports.
horseback riding.

510
00:24:13.887 --> 00:24:15.454
skiing. scuba diving.

511
00:24:15.497 --> 00:24:18.152
weight lifting. rollerblading.
roller-skating.

512
00:24:18.195 --> 00:24:21.982
skateboarding. surfing.
bungee jumping. bike riding.

513
00:24:22.025 --> 00:24:25.159
or riding in vehicles weighing

514
00:24:25.202 --> 00:24:28.162
including but not limited
to motorcycles.

515
00:24:28.205 --> 00:24:30.556
Vespas slash scooters.

516
00:24:30.599 --> 00:24:33.384
dune buggies. jet skis. Segues.

517
00:24:33.428 --> 00:24:35.212
Jeeps or smart cars."

518
00:24:35.256 --> 00:24:36.257
See?

519
00:24:37.388 --> 00:24:38.607
Well. first of all. all that is.

520
00:24:38.651 --> 00:24:40.696
is "including
but not limited to".

521
00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:43.177
And second of all. it could be
consider a contact sport.

522
00:24:44.265 --> 00:24:46.485
Right?
And Bryce rides a scooter!

523
00:24:46.528 --> 00:24:48.399
-I mean...
-He's not plowing me

524
00:24:48.443 --> 00:24:49.488
on a scooter.

525
00:24:53.274 --> 00:24:54.536
That's actually what I...

526
00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:56.016
Oh. hang on. hang on.

527
00:24:56.059 --> 00:24:58.105
I'm gonna cut you off because...
It says right here...

528
00:24:58.148 --> 00:24:59.280
not supposed to ask you

529
00:24:59.323 --> 00:25:00.455
what you're gonna do
with the money.

530
00:25:00.499 --> 00:25:03.023
You didn't ask me
about the money.

531
00:25:03.066 --> 00:25:04.328
Oh. yeah. you're right.

532
00:25:04.372 --> 00:25:07.418
Yeah. you were just volunteering
the information.

533
00:25:08.724 --> 00:25:09.769
Yeah. go on.

534
00:25:10.509 --> 00:25:11.901
I graduated late

535
00:25:11.945 --> 00:25:13.642
because I was...

536
00:25:13.686 --> 00:25:16.950
Um... and I missed college.

537
00:25:16.993 --> 00:25:19.387
I got an associates degree
online.

538
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:23.217
So there's this accelerated
degree program in Vermont

539
00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:24.958
where if I could get accepted

540
00:25:25.001 --> 00:25:27.090
I would go to school
for three and a half years.

541
00:25:27.134 --> 00:25:28.527
No breaks.

542
00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:32.095
I can finish my bachelors
and. uh. get my masters.

543
00:25:32.139 --> 00:25:35.098
That's incredible.
What are you gonna study?

544
00:25:35.142 --> 00:25:36.317
-Hospitali...
-

545
00:25:38.014 --> 00:25:40.451
I just wanna double-check.
Make sure this is like...

546
00:25:41.061 --> 00:25:42.105
Oh. cool.

547
00:25:44.543 --> 00:25:46.893
You just look?

548
00:25:46.936 --> 00:25:51.201
Yeah. just swipe and
check out all of the pictures.

549
00:25:51.245 --> 00:25:53.508
They're your friends?
- No. Strangers.

550
00:25:53.552 --> 00:25:55.075
-What's this do?
-

551
00:25:55.118 --> 00:25:58.469
That is your "favorite button"
so if you hit that

552
00:25:58.513 --> 00:26:00.950
then the person goes on
to your favorite list

553
00:26:00.994 --> 00:26:03.126
and you can look
at him anytime you want.

554
00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:05.476
Otherwise. you just see
the person once ever.

555
00:26:07.478 --> 00:26:10.046
How do you know if you're
in someone else's favorites?

556
00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:12.179
You don't.

557
00:26:12.222 --> 00:26:14.137
This is the saddest app
I've ever seen.

558
00:26:14.181 --> 00:26:15.443
Aren't you a millennial?

559
00:26:15.486 --> 00:26:16.749
You're supposed to know
all about this stuff.

560
00:26:16.792 --> 00:26:17.880
People use this?

561
00:26:17.924 --> 00:26:18.925
Yeah.

562
00:26:18.968 --> 00:26:20.970
Enough to pay for the baby.

563
00:26:21.014 --> 00:26:22.232
Weird.

564
00:26:24.017 --> 00:26:25.148
This is it.

565
00:26:25.192 --> 00:26:26.497
The nursery-to-be.

566
00:26:27.194 --> 00:26:28.325
It's cute.

567
00:26:28.369 --> 00:26:29.718
Right. It's gonna be great.

568
00:26:30.719 --> 00:26:32.808
Speck of light.
-Huh.

569
00:26:32.852 --> 00:26:36.203
Yeah. There's a lot
of swatches up there.

570
00:26:36.246 --> 00:26:39.336
It's very hard to pick a color
for the nursery

571
00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:42.165
because there's a lot
of writing on it.

572
00:26:42.209 --> 00:26:43.819
For example. take orange.

573
00:26:43.863 --> 00:26:48.128
Orange is usually good
for joy and creativity.

574
00:26:48.171 --> 00:26:52.045
But a dark orange
can trigger deceit or distrust.

575
00:26:52.785 --> 00:26:54.917
Uh. yellow.

576
00:26:54.961 --> 00:26:59.748
Usually associated
with happiness and intellect.

577
00:26:59.792 --> 00:27:04.623
but it can also symbolize
sickness or decay.

578
00:27:04.666 --> 00:27:09.802
Green. may sustain growth.
renewal. safety. nature.

579
00:27:09.845 --> 00:27:10.933
Well. guess what?

580
00:27:10.977 --> 00:27:14.633
It's also greed. money. avarice.

581
00:27:14.676 --> 00:27:17.287
Where...
where you getting all this?

582
00:27:20.943 --> 00:27:21.944
This.

583
00:27:23.816 --> 00:27:26.601
"Opening the Shades: The deeper meaning behind colors

584
00:27:26.645 --> 00:27:28.385
and the subconscious hold
they have

585
00:27:28.429 --> 00:27:29.648
on a developing mind."

586
00:27:29.691 --> 00:27:31.650
That's kind of intense.

587
00:27:31.693 --> 00:27:34.130
Mm-hm. You know it was
in the baby section.

588
00:27:35.392 --> 00:27:36.393
Oh.

589
00:27:49.668 --> 00:27:51.408
This one is kind of looking
a little like

590
00:27:51.452 --> 00:27:52.758
pea soup to me now.

591
00:27:52.801 --> 00:27:54.803
Mm-hm. Yeah.

592
00:27:54.847 --> 00:27:59.286
And this one looks
a little bright for sleeping.

593
00:27:59.329 --> 00:28:00.809
Even with the lights off?

594
00:28:02.289 --> 00:28:03.290
Yeah.

595
00:28:05.509 --> 00:28:07.120
Wow. it got really late.

596
00:28:10.645 --> 00:28:12.038
Yeah. this one is kind of like

597
00:28:12.081 --> 00:28:13.692
what a waiting room
would be painted.

598
00:28:13.735 --> 00:28:16.172
Mm-hm. Yeah.

599
00:28:16.216 --> 00:28:18.740
That's like an old IBM PC.

600
00:29:01.391 --> 00:29:05.656
"Dusty blue-green.
impractical and idealist."

601
00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:23.196
-First time?
-Hm? Yeah. yeah.

602
00:29:23.239 --> 00:29:26.025
So are you.
three. four months now?

603
00:29:26.068 --> 00:29:28.288
Exactly. Hm.

604
00:29:28.331 --> 00:29:30.116
Six and a half.

605
00:29:30.159 --> 00:29:32.466
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

606
00:29:32.509 --> 00:29:33.554
Thank you.

607
00:29:33.597 --> 00:29:34.947
My couple...

608
00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:37.645
is out of town.

609
00:29:37.688 --> 00:29:38.907
They're in Iowa.

610
00:29:38.951 --> 00:29:41.344
They're great
and we. we talk all the time

611
00:29:41.388 --> 00:29:43.346
and we...
you know. we Skype a lot.

612
00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:45.827
I'm good
at reminding myself and my son

613
00:29:45.871 --> 00:29:48.656
that this baby is not
a part of our family.

614
00:29:48.699 --> 00:29:52.529
And you know my husband
needs no reminding.

615
00:29:52.573 --> 00:29:55.445
He's great.
Very supportive. I love him.

616
00:29:55.489 --> 00:29:58.797
I just haven't been able
to talk with anyone about it.

617
00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.537
some kind of bottled up.
I guess.

618
00:30:00.581 --> 00:30:01.800
I'm jealous.

619
00:30:01.843 --> 00:30:03.497
We can't stop talking about it.

620
00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:05.151
I long for small talk.

621
00:30:05.194 --> 00:30:07.936
Uh. we're ready
to begin if you wanna circle up.

622
00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:09.329
Oh. I'll catch you later. man.

623
00:30:13.812 --> 00:30:15.335
Hello. Hi.

624
00:30:15.378 --> 00:30:17.206
My guy is local.

625
00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:22.951
He is single
so it's just us. um...

626
00:30:22.995 --> 00:30:27.216
Sometimes I really want
my space like...

627
00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:29.610
when he is monitoring my diet

628
00:30:29.653 --> 00:30:33.396
or the person I'm sleeping with.
but then...

629
00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:36.747
I also had a really okay time

630
00:30:36.791 --> 00:30:39.228
picking the color
for the nursery with him.

631
00:30:39.272 --> 00:30:41.883
That was cool
'cause it was...

632
00:30:41.927 --> 00:30:44.320
It was nice to picture
where this is all going.

633
00:30:49.195 --> 00:30:51.850
What you were saying
about like. uh.

634
00:30:51.893 --> 00:30:54.287
"no two days
have to be the same"?

635
00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:56.637
Right. Every day is new.

636
00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:59.945
Yeah. I mean both the things
that I have mentioned

637
00:30:59.988 --> 00:31:01.903
happened on the same day. but...

638
00:31:03.644 --> 00:31:04.645
yeah.

639
00:31:05.689 --> 00:31:06.995
How was group?

640
00:31:07.039 --> 00:31:09.215
It's fine. It's weird.

641
00:31:09.258 --> 00:31:11.391
Uh... what about you?

642
00:31:11.434 --> 00:31:12.566
I am...

643
00:31:15.743 --> 00:31:17.876
I was the only one there alone.

644
00:31:17.919 --> 00:31:21.183
I was the only one there. uh.
without a family at home.

645
00:31:21.227 --> 00:31:22.271
Mm.

646
00:31:23.185 --> 00:31:24.360
What are you up to?

647
00:31:26.493 --> 00:31:29.235
The show is so dumb.

648
00:31:29.278 --> 00:31:31.890
This is a timeless classic
television show.

649
00:31:31.933 --> 00:31:34.805
It is the Godfather
of television shows.

650
00:31:34.849 --> 00:31:36.982
And I mean that
as in the movie Godfather.

651
00:31:37.025 --> 00:31:39.071
What the... What the movie
Godfather is to movies.

652
00:31:39.114 --> 00:31:41.160
this is to the television shows.

653
00:31:41.203 --> 00:31:43.989
So Ross went to college
with Chandler.

654
00:31:44.032 --> 00:31:48.732
And. and just happened to move
across the hall from Monica.

655
00:31:48.776 --> 00:31:50.778
No Ross and Monica are siblings.

656
00:31:50.821 --> 00:31:52.562
Come on. Anna. you know this.

657
00:31:52.606 --> 00:31:55.609
Do. do you still. uh. talk
to any of your college friends?

658
00:31:55.652 --> 00:31:58.003
Yeah. Yeah. for sure.

659
00:31:58.046 --> 00:32:01.876
Um. at this point.
they're all either settled down

660
00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:07.273
or desperately clinging
to the corpse of their youth.

661
00:32:07.316 --> 00:32:10.841
-And you are?
-Right in the middle.

662
00:32:11.755 --> 00:32:12.756
Yeah.

663
00:32:13.801 --> 00:32:16.630
What about you? College friends?

664
00:32:16.673 --> 00:32:18.588
-Oh. I... I didn't go.
-Oh. right.

665
00:32:18.632 --> 00:32:21.765
Uh. are you still in touch
with high school friends?

666
00:32:21.809 --> 00:32:23.071
No. no.

667
00:32:31.297 --> 00:32:34.822
Um... why are you alone?

668
00:32:37.651 --> 00:32:39.566
Um. sorry. what?

669
00:32:39.609 --> 00:32:42.961
Like why are you
doing this alone?

670
00:32:43.004 --> 00:32:47.313
Well. I would like to have
a family and this is a...

671
00:32:47.356 --> 00:32:50.316
Not... not the answer
that you gave in the interview.

672
00:32:53.014 --> 00:32:54.146
Okay.

673
00:32:55.451 --> 00:32:59.151
Um... because I am alone.

674
00:33:00.065 --> 00:33:01.109
That's why.

675
00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:04.591
Yeah. I just...

676
00:33:04.634 --> 00:33:07.681
You know I feel I'm.
I'm in this chapter of my life

677
00:33:07.724 --> 00:33:10.292
that feels like it should
be over but it's not.

678
00:33:10.336 --> 00:33:11.946
It's just on a loop.

679
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:13.730
When I hang out
with my settled friends.

680
00:33:13.774 --> 00:33:16.298
I feel sad for what I want
and don't have.

681
00:33:16.342 --> 00:33:19.040
And when I hang out
with my single friends.

682
00:33:19.084 --> 00:33:22.043
I feel sad for what I have
and don't want.

683
00:33:22.087 --> 00:33:25.394
And I'm just...
I. I just...

684
00:33:25.438 --> 00:33:28.832
need to move forward.

685
00:33:28.876 --> 00:33:33.185
And it just so happens
that I'm doing it by myself.

686
00:33:33.228 --> 00:33:35.013
Was there ever anyone
that you thought

687
00:33:35.056 --> 00:33:36.405
you'd be doing this with?

688
00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.278
Yeah. there was actually.

689
00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:41.845
For eight years.

690
00:33:41.889 --> 00:33:43.586
Um. but it didn't work out.

691
00:33:45.153 --> 00:33:47.982
You know sometimes
it doesn't work out.

692
00:33:49.679 --> 00:33:51.551
People think I'm giving
something up to do this.

693
00:33:51.594 --> 00:33:53.205
but I don't feel
that way at all.

694
00:33:53.248 --> 00:33:57.557
I just feel like I'm pursuing
this thing that I care about.

695
00:34:00.255 --> 00:34:04.999
It's weird to be perceived
as hopeless in this moment

696
00:34:05.043 --> 00:34:07.306
when I'm actually
incredibly hopeful.

697
00:34:12.485 --> 00:34:14.139
Why are you alone?

698
00:34:14.182 --> 00:34:16.706
I'm 26.

699
00:34:17.925 --> 00:34:19.753
But you're with your family?

700
00:34:20.797 --> 00:34:22.582
Um...

701
00:34:22.625 --> 00:34:25.933
Well. they never looked at me

702
00:34:25.976 --> 00:34:30.024
the same way
after I got pregnant.

703
00:34:30.068 --> 00:34:37.031
And I got tired of seeing myself
the way they saw me.

704
00:34:37.075 --> 00:34:39.077
Or see me.

705
00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:42.645
They were really mad
when I got pregnant

706
00:34:42.689 --> 00:34:48.086
and they were really mad
when I gave it up for adoption.

707
00:34:49.043 --> 00:34:51.089
Uh...

708
00:34:51.132 --> 00:34:55.702
It really seemed like the only
way they were gonna be happy

709
00:34:55.745 --> 00:34:58.879
as if I was wildly unhappy.

710
00:34:58.922 --> 00:34:59.923
Um...

711
00:35:00.837 --> 00:35:01.838
So...

712
00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:03.971
Yeah.

713
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:07.366
Do you miss them?

714
00:35:07.409 --> 00:35:09.542
Um. yeah.

715
00:35:09.585 --> 00:35:14.329
But I missed them before. uh.
we stopped talking.

716
00:35:15.504 --> 00:35:17.941
I miss the family I had
when I was ten.

717
00:35:17.985 --> 00:35:21.206
Uh. not talking has actually
made it. like. much easier.

718
00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:28.038
Sometimes things
just don't work out.

719
00:35:31.781 --> 00:35:33.305
I think I've heard
that somewhere.

720
00:35:38.832 --> 00:35:41.313
Oh. it's like shopping!

721
00:35:43.228 --> 00:35:45.143
Thank you so much
for doing this with me.

722
00:35:47.101 --> 00:35:48.624
So are you gonna have

723
00:35:48.668 --> 00:35:50.278
the baby shower?

724
00:35:50.322 --> 00:35:52.889
Um... no.

725
00:35:52.933 --> 00:35:54.021
Why not?

726
00:35:54.064 --> 00:35:55.240
It just seems kinda weird.

727
00:35:55.283 --> 00:35:57.242
Because you're a guy?

728
00:35:58.156 --> 00:35:59.200
I don't know.

729
00:35:59.244 --> 00:36:01.246
Because you're single?

730
00:36:01.289 --> 00:36:03.161
Well. you're not making it sound
less weird.

731
00:36:03.204 --> 00:36:04.858
I think you should have one.

732
00:36:05.293 --> 00:36:06.338
Really?

733
00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:09.515
Would you come?

734
00:36:10.211 --> 00:36:11.734
Yeah.

735
00:36:11.778 --> 00:36:14.346
It. it can't miss
its own baby shower.

736
00:36:14.389 --> 00:36:17.392
Can we not keep calling it "it"?

737
00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:20.090
Yeah. sorry. um...

738
00:36:20.134 --> 00:36:21.831
-Oh.
-They can't miss

739
00:36:21.875 --> 00:36:23.703
its own baby shower.

740
00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:28.621
Yeah. maybe we can
come up with. like.

741
00:36:28.664 --> 00:36:30.884
a gender-neutral name
for the interim.

742
00:36:30.927 --> 00:36:34.627
What's a gender-neutral name?
Like Pat or Tag?

743
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:37.107
Well. Pat's lame and Tag
is male.

744
00:36:37.151 --> 00:36:38.718
I don't think
they should know the name.

745
00:36:38.761 --> 00:36:40.720
I mean just temporary
till we find out the sex

746
00:36:40.763 --> 00:36:42.200
and then I can give it
a real name.

747
00:36:42.243 --> 00:36:44.289
I don't think I should know
the sex either.

748
00:36:44.332 --> 00:36:45.638
-Really?
- Yeah.

749
00:36:45.681 --> 00:36:46.726
Like Switzerland.

750
00:36:46.769 --> 00:36:49.207
I guess the less I know
the better.

751
00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:50.860
That's what they say in group.

752
00:36:50.904 --> 00:36:53.123
They're saying the opposite
in my group.

753
00:36:53.167 --> 00:36:54.386
Great.

754
00:36:54.429 --> 00:36:55.517
Well. so. let's just come up
with something

755
00:36:55.561 --> 00:36:56.649
for the time being.

756
00:36:56.692 --> 00:36:58.303
How about Peanut?

757
00:36:58.346 --> 00:37:00.000
I think that's too human.

758
00:37:01.784 --> 00:37:04.396
What about Radio?

759
00:37:04.439 --> 00:37:05.745
Radio?

760
00:37:05.788 --> 00:37:10.228
Yeah. it's like personable
but anonymous.

761
00:37:10.271 --> 00:37:12.578
Excuse. a little male to me
for some reason.

762
00:37:12.621 --> 00:37:13.666
Soda?

763
00:37:13.709 --> 00:37:14.841
Hmm. female.

764
00:37:15.494 --> 00:37:16.538
What about Leaf?

765
00:37:16.582 --> 00:37:18.236
I think that's actually a name.

766
00:37:18.279 --> 00:37:19.237
Yeah.

767
00:37:19.933 --> 00:37:21.021
Lamp?

768
00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:24.590
Lamp?

769
00:37:26.766 --> 00:37:29.421
Yeah. I don't...
I don't know what lamp is.

770
00:37:29.464 --> 00:37:30.552
Okay.

771
00:37:30.596 --> 00:37:31.640
Lamp.

772
00:37:31.684 --> 00:37:32.685
Lamp.

773
00:37:34.121 --> 00:37:36.297
I'm not going to whisper.

774
00:37:36.341 --> 00:37:37.646
I don't mean
to actually whisper.

775
00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:40.997
I just mean
like talk very softly.

776
00:37:41.041 --> 00:37:43.173
-Matt.
-Well...

777
00:37:43.217 --> 00:37:45.654
I mean your voice
is gonna be the. the voice

778
00:37:45.698 --> 00:37:47.569
that Lamp identifies
with the most.

779
00:37:47.613 --> 00:37:51.269
'Cause Lamp hears you
all the time

780
00:37:51.312 --> 00:37:54.184
and so I'm just trying
to figure out a way to like...

781
00:37:54.228 --> 00:37:57.536
also make my voice
a strong presence.

782
00:37:57.579 --> 00:37:59.494
So I think if you are soft...

783
00:38:00.669 --> 00:38:02.105
Just a little softer.

784
00:38:02.149 --> 00:38:04.673
Okay. well then. why don't you
just yell all the time?

785
00:38:04.717 --> 00:38:06.545
I don't come across
with angry...

786
00:38:06.588 --> 00:38:07.589
Anna?

787
00:38:08.242 --> 00:38:09.765
Anna Caper?

788
00:38:09.809 --> 00:38:11.419
-Hey...
-Carly!

789
00:38:11.463 --> 00:38:12.725
Oh. Carly!

790
00:38:12.768 --> 00:38:13.943
-Oh. my God. hi.
-Hi.

791
00:38:13.987 --> 00:38:15.728
I haven't seen you
in forever.

792
00:38:15.771 --> 00:38:17.033
Hi. yeah.

793
00:38:17.077 --> 00:38:18.600
What are you doing here?

794
00:38:18.644 --> 00:38:19.688
My cousin's out here.

795
00:38:19.732 --> 00:38:21.429
I'm visiting
for her baby shower.

796
00:38:21.473 --> 00:38:23.997
Yeah. So you live here now?

797
00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:25.868
I do. Yeah.

798
00:38:25.912 --> 00:38:29.045
How's. um... law school?

799
00:38:29.089 --> 00:38:30.220
So crazy!

800
00:38:30.264 --> 00:38:31.961
It's just the first year
but still.

801
00:38:32.005 --> 00:38:33.963
We're like real adults.

802
00:38:34.007 --> 00:38:36.357
Not just like college adults.
you know what I mean?

803
00:38:36.401 --> 00:38:39.534
Yeah. it sneaks up on you.
really fast.

804
00:38:39.578 --> 00:38:41.319
-So you live here.
-Mm-hm.

805
00:38:41.362 --> 00:38:43.321
And you moved
with your boyfriend. right?

806
00:38:43.364 --> 00:38:45.497
-Right.
- Aw.

807
00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:47.977
Is a congratulations
in order or...

808
00:38:48.021 --> 00:38:51.633
Not really.
he lives in Seattle now.

809
00:38:51.677 --> 00:38:55.202
I meant like. you know...
a baby...

810
00:38:56.159 --> 00:38:58.684
-No. No. no. no.
- No?

811
00:38:58.727 --> 00:39:00.903
-No. no. No.
-No? Oh.

812
00:39:00.947 --> 00:39:03.471
So what are you doing
in maternity wear?

813
00:39:05.038 --> 00:39:07.867
-I'm working.
-Working?

814
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:09.303
Working here?

815
00:39:09.347 --> 00:39:11.392
-Yes. Yeah. at the store.
- Oh. great.

816
00:39:11.436 --> 00:39:12.698
Hi. excuse me.

817
00:39:12.741 --> 00:39:14.874
Uh. sorry to interrupt.
You work here?

818
00:39:14.917 --> 00:39:18.181
Uh. what's the difference
between these two items?

819
00:39:20.967 --> 00:39:23.056
The material and the color.

820
00:39:26.276 --> 00:39:27.277
Hmm.

821
00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:29.932
-Mm.
-Yeah.

822
00:39:29.976 --> 00:39:33.283
Also. um. somebody dropped
some clothes on the floor.

823
00:39:33.327 --> 00:39:34.981
you may wanna look into it.

824
00:39:35.024 --> 00:39:36.374
-Yeah. okay.
- Mm.

825
00:39:36.417 --> 00:39:37.549
I should go. I should go.

826
00:39:37.592 --> 00:39:39.246
-It was great to see you.
-Yeah.

827
00:39:39.289 --> 00:39:41.727
Allie is gonna freak out
when I tell her I ran into you.

828
00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:44.077
It's the smallest world ever.

829
00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:45.470
-Cool.
- Okay.

830
00:39:45.513 --> 00:39:47.776
Oh. do you know where
the. the Bath Buddies are?

831
00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:49.169
-Bath Buddies?
- Mm-hm.

832
00:39:49.212 --> 00:39:51.171
Yeah. Um. over there.

833
00:39:51.214 --> 00:39:53.565
You're gonna wanna check
over there.

834
00:39:53.608 --> 00:39:55.088
-There? Okay.
-Mm-hm.

835
00:39:55.131 --> 00:39:56.394
Yeah. um. yeah.

836
00:39:59.266 --> 00:40:01.442
Hey. hey. I... I don't want you
to lift this stuff up.

837
00:40:01.486 --> 00:40:04.402
I can lift something
I was already carrying.

838
00:40:06.491 --> 00:40:08.449
Who was that?

839
00:40:08.493 --> 00:40:11.234
-It's my sister's friend.
-You have a sister?

840
00:40:12.888 --> 00:40:14.890
-Yes.
-I have a brother.

841
00:40:16.849 --> 00:40:19.199
See. whispering
is not so bad. right?

842
00:40:23.595 --> 00:40:26.293
Hey. I didn't know
you had a sister.

843
00:40:27.294 --> 00:40:30.297
Yeah. Allie.

844
00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:33.343
Oh. she's gonna know
I'm not with Jason anymore.

845
00:40:33.953 --> 00:40:35.084
Who is Jason?

846
00:40:35.128 --> 00:40:37.696
It's the guy I moved here
to be with.

847
00:40:38.697 --> 00:40:40.612
What happened to him?

848
00:40:40.655 --> 00:40:44.703
It. it doesn't matter.
it was a long time ago.

849
00:40:44.746 --> 00:40:49.142
Do you think that...
she could tell that I was lying

850
00:40:49.185 --> 00:40:50.230
about being pregnant?

851
00:40:50.273 --> 00:40:51.492
No.

852
00:40:51.536 --> 00:40:54.364
No. no.
we did a good job covering it.

853
00:40:55.714 --> 00:40:56.976
Hey.

854
00:40:57.019 --> 00:40:58.586
What's happening?

855
00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:03.504
I just...
I hate the idea of Allie...

856
00:41:03.548 --> 00:41:05.419
finding out
that I'm pregnant again.

857
00:41:06.246 --> 00:41:08.596
And my mom and dad.

858
00:41:10.555 --> 00:41:15.255
Oh. look... they. they probably
not gonna find out. right?

859
00:41:15.298 --> 00:41:18.345
But even if they do.
what's the worst-case scenario?

860
00:41:18.388 --> 00:41:22.001
I don't know
like it would confirm

861
00:41:22.044 --> 00:41:24.046
what they think
about me already. That...

862
00:41:26.484 --> 00:41:28.877
That they're right.
That the only thing I'm good at

863
00:41:28.921 --> 00:41:30.096
is getting pregnant.

864
00:41:33.229 --> 00:41:34.622
-Okay.
-

865
00:41:34.666 --> 00:41:39.540
You have also helped
to create two families.

866
00:41:41.194 --> 00:41:44.502
By giving
the hardest possible gifts.

867
00:41:44.545 --> 00:41:49.376
First. your actual kid
and now your actual self.

868
00:41:49.419 --> 00:41:53.685
They are not silver linings.
they're stand-alone good things.

869
00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:01.693
That's really nice.

870
00:42:02.607 --> 00:42:03.738
Thank you.

871
00:42:04.739 --> 00:42:05.827
You're welcome.

872
00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:08.830
Let's get some house plants.

873
00:42:08.874 --> 00:42:10.223
It's supposed to help filter out

874
00:42:10.266 --> 00:42:12.660
harmful airborne
household toxins.

875
00:42:12.704 --> 00:42:13.748
What?

876
00:42:15.228 --> 00:42:17.143
So. you like

877
00:42:17.186 --> 00:42:18.840
-just looking?
- Yeah.

878
00:42:18.884 --> 00:42:20.450
'Cause I feel like on Tinder.
everyone wants. like.

879
00:42:20.494 --> 00:42:22.017
to send you a dick pic
or they want you

880
00:42:22.061 --> 00:42:25.412
to sit on their face or even
worse like buy them dinner.

881
00:42:25.455 --> 00:42:27.588
Here. I can just. like. look.

882
00:42:27.632 --> 00:42:29.547
Can't you just swipe no
on Tinder?

883
00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:31.113
Isn't that like the same thing?

884
00:42:31.157 --> 00:42:33.333
No. it wouldn't be
because you probably end up

885
00:42:33.376 --> 00:42:35.335
hurting someone's feelings
or if you're like me.

886
00:42:35.378 --> 00:42:38.599
you'll end up getting drunk and
sitting on their face. anyway.

887
00:42:38.643 --> 00:42:41.167
I can't believe the father
of your baby made Loner.

888
00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:43.604
-It's not my baby.
-

889
00:42:43.648 --> 00:42:46.389
I can't believe
the straight single guy

890
00:42:46.433 --> 00:42:49.044
who you see all the time
slash exclusively

891
00:42:49.088 --> 00:42:51.960
who fathered the child inside
of you made Loner.

892
00:42:53.614 --> 00:42:55.834
It's my second favorite app.

893
00:42:55.877 --> 00:42:57.575
What's your first favorite app?

894
00:42:57.618 --> 00:42:59.054
An app that tracks your periods.

895
00:42:59.098 --> 00:43:01.274
Why do you have an app
that tracks your periods?

896
00:43:01.317 --> 00:43:03.581
Hmm. my periods. your periods.

897
00:43:03.624 --> 00:43:05.191
-What? Oh. my God!

898
00:43:05.234 --> 00:43:07.149
Here. There you go.
You're welcome.

899
00:43:07.193 --> 00:43:08.760
Hey.

900
00:43:08.803 --> 00:43:10.544
Hello. You about to ready to go?

901
00:43:10.588 --> 00:43:13.503
Yeah. let me run this till back
really quickly.

902
00:43:13.547 --> 00:43:15.636
By the way. uh.
brought you some pregnancy tea

903
00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:18.770
and. for the record.
this stuff is awesome.

904
00:43:18.813 --> 00:43:21.294
I'm like totally hooked on it.

905
00:43:21.337 --> 00:43:24.645
And as far as I know.
I'm not pregnant.

906
00:43:24.689 --> 00:43:26.691
Um. Matt.
have you met Jules yet?

907
00:43:26.734 --> 00:43:29.911
I don't think we've been
officially introduced but...

908
00:43:29.955 --> 00:43:32.218
we've exchanged a lot
of cold stares so...

909
00:43:32.261 --> 00:43:33.306
Okay.

910
00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:34.350
I'll be right back.

911
00:43:48.016 --> 00:43:49.844
Don't name your kid Jesse.

912
00:43:51.106 --> 00:43:52.586
I'm sorry. what?

913
00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:55.110
Do not name your kid Jesse.

914
00:43:56.677 --> 00:43:57.983
Why not?

915
00:43:59.071 --> 00:44:00.333
'Cause I know a Jesse

916
00:44:00.376 --> 00:44:03.162
who doesn't even know
what tumble dry low is.

917
00:44:07.601 --> 00:44:09.647
Tumble. Dry. Low.

918
00:44:15.957 --> 00:44:18.133
-Hey. you ready?
-Yeah.

919
00:44:18.177 --> 00:44:20.440
Um. okay.
Uh. I'm gonna head out.

920
00:44:20.483 --> 00:44:23.791
Can you please just like
clean up the. uh. syrup pumps?

921
00:44:23.835 --> 00:44:25.184
Yeah. okay.

922
00:44:25.227 --> 00:44:26.794
Thank you so much.
I really appreciated it.

923
00:44:26.838 --> 00:44:28.187
-Okay. bye.
- See ya.

924
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:30.189
-See ya. Have a great day.
- Thanks. you too.

925
00:44:30.232 --> 00:44:31.233
Bye.

926
00:44:34.889 --> 00:44:36.848
Did you guys wanna find out
the sex today?

927
00:44:36.891 --> 00:44:38.197
-Yeah.
-No.

928
00:44:39.633 --> 00:44:41.026
I thought we agreed.

929
00:44:41.069 --> 00:44:42.462
To what?

930
00:44:42.505 --> 00:44:43.768
That I shouldn't know.

931
00:44:45.073 --> 00:44:46.814
Well...

932
00:44:47.902 --> 00:44:49.208
It's my baby. Anna.

933
00:44:49.251 --> 00:44:51.210
I just wanna feel as involved
as possible.

934
00:44:51.253 --> 00:44:52.646
You are involved.

935
00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:56.519
You won't feel any less
of a connection with Lamp...

936
00:44:56.563 --> 00:44:59.174
just because you didn't find out
the sex ahead of time.

937
00:44:59.218 --> 00:45:00.219
I promise.

938
00:45:02.134 --> 00:45:04.832
Meanwhile. I'm over here...

939
00:45:04.876 --> 00:45:07.487
having a really hard time
setting boundaries

940
00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:09.881
because I share a body
with the thing

941
00:45:09.924 --> 00:45:12.100
that I'm supposed
to stay separate from.

942
00:45:13.232 --> 00:45:14.668
Move in to my house.

943
00:45:15.277 --> 00:45:16.714
What?

944
00:45:16.757 --> 00:45:18.628
Just until the pregnancy
is over.

945
00:45:18.672 --> 00:45:20.587
I just wanna know everything.

946
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:22.763
I wanna know when you're up
in the middle of the night.

947
00:45:22.807 --> 00:45:24.896
I wanna feel all the kicks.

948
00:45:24.939 --> 00:45:26.593
Speaking of boundaries.

949
00:45:28.247 --> 00:45:30.684
Well. I can give you guys
a minute.

950
00:45:30.728 --> 00:45:31.903
No. it's okay.

951
00:45:31.946 --> 00:45:34.296
You can...
You can tell him. Just not me.

952
00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:36.211
-Okay.

953
00:45:37.169 --> 00:45:38.387
Are you ready?

954
00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:42.217
Yeah. don't. yeah. Don't say it.

955
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:44.045
Are you sure?

956
00:45:44.567 --> 00:45:45.786
Yes.

957
00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:47.657
Yeah.
because I will blurt it out.

958
00:45:47.701 --> 00:45:48.963
I definitely blurt it out

959
00:45:49.007 --> 00:45:50.748
or I'll be so nervous
that I'll blurt it out.

960
00:45:50.791 --> 00:45:52.488
That I'll blurt it out.

961
00:45:52.532 --> 00:45:54.012
Better I don't know.

962
00:45:54.055 --> 00:45:56.492
Well. a pleasure as always.

963
00:45:57.885 --> 00:45:59.539
The doctor will be in shortly.

964
00:46:02.107 --> 00:46:08.113
I can't tell if she
is really rude or amazing.

965
00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:11.377
I don't think she meant it
when she said

966
00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:12.770
I was a "pleasure as always".

967
00:46:14.249 --> 00:46:15.729
Yeah. I think she is amazing.

968
00:46:35.793 --> 00:46:38.752
Hi. Anna. It's your mother.

969
00:46:38.796 --> 00:46:42.451
Allie said a friend of hers
saw you in California.

970
00:46:42.495 --> 00:46:45.715
You're still working retail
I hear.

971
00:46:45.759 --> 00:46:51.809
And. uh. Jason left you
or. uh. maybe you left him.

972
00:46:51.852 --> 00:46:54.420
And if there is anything else
you'd like to tell me.

973
00:46:54.463 --> 00:46:56.639
I promise I won't be surprised.

974
00:46:58.206 --> 00:46:59.860
Your father says hello.

975
00:47:22.665 --> 00:47:24.929
I can stay over occasionally.

976
00:47:31.196 --> 00:47:34.590
Yeah. but "Evil doctor"
is the archetype.

977
00:47:34.634 --> 00:47:37.158
-Not "Evil Mister".
- Here's my question.

978
00:47:37.202 --> 00:47:39.944
Where does a monster
even get a doctorate?

979
00:47:39.987 --> 00:47:42.990
Lots of monsters
have doctorates. It's...

980
00:47:43.034 --> 00:47:44.731
Wait. what are we talking about?

981
00:47:44.774 --> 00:47:46.037
Um...

982
00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:48.039
Jason. Your ex.

983
00:47:48.082 --> 00:47:52.434
Right. Yeah. Jason was a real
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

984
00:47:53.435 --> 00:47:55.873
Not so unlike my dad.

985
00:47:55.916 --> 00:47:58.527
My dad was more
of a Dr. Honeydew.

986
00:48:00.051 --> 00:48:01.313
Who is that?

987
00:48:01.356 --> 00:48:03.315
Who is Dr. Honeydew?

988
00:48:04.142 --> 00:48:05.970
Are you kidding me?

989
00:48:06.013 --> 00:48:08.929
From the Muppets.
big yellow head.

990
00:48:08.973 --> 00:48:12.628
Constantly torturing
his lab assistant Beaker.

991
00:48:14.326 --> 00:48:17.416
Which. frankly.
is not unlike me.

992
00:48:17.459 --> 00:48:20.071
I guess that would
make me Beaker.

993
00:48:20.723 --> 00:48:21.811
Whatever.

994
00:48:22.856 --> 00:48:24.292
Uh. no. no. no. Stay put.

995
00:48:24.336 --> 00:48:25.728
-

996
00:48:30.472 --> 00:48:34.694
What's with the
all these lady books?

997
00:48:34.737 --> 00:48:37.653
Uh.
those are parenting books

998
00:48:37.697 --> 00:48:40.439
for single parents.
but everything I could find

999
00:48:40.482 --> 00:48:44.356
for single dad was for guys
who are divorced or widowers

1000
00:48:44.399 --> 00:48:46.271
which didn't really apply.

1001
00:48:46.314 --> 00:48:49.448
What about "A Father Knows"?

1002
00:48:49.491 --> 00:48:52.538
Oh. yeah. that one. um...

1003
00:48:52.581 --> 00:48:54.192
I thought that was
a parenting book

1004
00:48:54.235 --> 00:48:56.934
and I couldn't quite make up
from the thumbnail online.

1005
00:48:56.977 --> 00:49:00.067
So I bought it
and not even close.

1006
00:49:01.286 --> 00:49:02.287
Okay.

1007
00:49:03.679 --> 00:49:05.072
You're sleeping
in my room.

1008
00:49:05.116 --> 00:49:06.334
And where are you?

1009
00:49:06.378 --> 00:49:08.380
I'm gonna sleep
in. uh. Lamp's room.

1010
00:49:08.423 --> 00:49:10.686
Oh.

1011
00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:12.993
I don't wanna kick you at it.
your bed.

1012
00:49:13.037 --> 00:49:15.691
It's okay. I don't wanna mess
with your Lamp-boundaries

1013
00:49:15.735 --> 00:49:17.867
by making you sleep
in the nursery.

1014
00:49:17.911 --> 00:49:20.392
-Okay.
-Yeah. it's all good. Come on.

1015
00:49:40.890 --> 00:49:41.979
Hey.

1016
00:49:47.506 --> 00:49:50.030
-Hey. are you okay?
-Yeah. Yeah. yeah.

1017
00:49:50.074 --> 00:49:51.945
Uh. Lamp's moving.

1018
00:49:55.775 --> 00:49:56.906
Hm.

1019
00:50:02.086 --> 00:50:03.087
Oh.

1020
00:50:15.186 --> 00:50:16.970
Hi. you two.

1021
00:50:17.014 --> 00:50:20.147
Might I interest you
in this Norwegian design.

1022
00:50:20.191 --> 00:50:22.845
it's made from
sustainably crafted lucite.

1023
00:50:22.889 --> 00:50:24.717
it's durable. it's waterproof.

1024
00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.980
It offers an open view
to the environment...

1025
00:50:27.024 --> 00:50:29.026
Oh. it's six thousand dollars.

1026
00:50:29.069 --> 00:50:30.070
Whoa.

1027
00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:36.772
Really this converts into
a toddler bed and a Mercedes?

1028
00:50:39.166 --> 00:50:40.776
No. but...

1029
00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:44.737
This crib converts from
a toddler bed to a day bed

1030
00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:47.653
and offers three different
infant mattress positions.

1031
00:50:47.696 --> 00:50:48.741
Oh.

1032
00:50:48.784 --> 00:50:50.177
It's. uh. $450.

1033
00:50:50.221 --> 00:50:53.006
It's made from particleboard.
As a warning.

1034
00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:55.443
Is that mean particleboard
is bad for the baby somehow?

1035
00:50:55.487 --> 00:50:57.054
No. Not at all.

1036
00:50:58.272 --> 00:50:59.882
-Okay. Great.
- Great.

1037
00:50:59.926 --> 00:51:01.754
-I really like this.
- Great.

1038
00:51:01.797 --> 00:51:05.410
Here is the item number.

1039
00:51:05.453 --> 00:51:07.890
Present this at the register.

1040
00:51:07.934 --> 00:51:10.850
I think you two were gonna be
really happy with this.

1041
00:51:10.893 --> 00:51:12.678
Ew. No. we're not together.

1042
00:51:12.721 --> 00:51:14.854
Oh.

1043
00:51:14.897 --> 00:51:16.116
She's my surrogate.

1044
00:51:16.986 --> 00:51:18.075
Ah.

1045
00:51:18.118 --> 00:51:21.121
We...
Why is the idea of me

1046
00:51:21.165 --> 00:51:22.992
being a single mom...

1047
00:51:23.036 --> 00:51:24.951
...and the idea of him
being a single dad...

1048
00:51:26.083 --> 00:51:27.084
Yeah.

1049
00:51:28.172 --> 00:51:30.087
Oh. Um...

1050
00:51:31.044 --> 00:51:32.350
I just...

1051
00:51:32.393 --> 00:51:34.178
Sorry.

1052
00:51:34.221 --> 00:51:35.831
I think we'll buy this
on the Internet.

1053
00:51:35.875 --> 00:51:38.007
Oh. we don't work off
commission.

1054
00:51:38.051 --> 00:51:39.096
Oh. you don't.

1055
00:51:48.453 --> 00:51:49.758
This is sure a lot of

1056
00:51:49.802 --> 00:51:51.238
the invitations
considering the fact

1057
00:51:51.282 --> 00:51:53.501
that I've never seen you talk
to anybody else.

1058
00:51:53.545 --> 00:51:56.243
or talk about
having other friends.

1059
00:51:58.115 --> 00:51:59.377
You're one to talk.

1060
00:52:09.822 --> 00:52:11.519
What's going on?

1061
00:52:11.563 --> 00:52:12.868
What are you talking about?

1062
00:52:14.435 --> 00:52:16.176
-You're being really quiet.
-No. I'm not.

1063
00:52:22.965 --> 00:52:24.750
Listen to how quiet
you're being right now.

1064
00:52:33.846 --> 00:52:36.327
At the store when the lady...

1065
00:52:36.370 --> 00:52:39.330
thought we were together.
you said. "Ew. no."

1066
00:52:39.373 --> 00:52:42.942
I didn't say "ew"
as in "you're gross".

1067
00:52:42.985 --> 00:52:47.338
I said "ew" as in "it would be
gross if we were a couple."

1068
00:52:47.381 --> 00:52:48.426
Why?

1069
00:52:48.469 --> 00:52:50.602
Why would that be gross?

1070
00:52:50.645 --> 00:52:52.691
Because you are like
20 years older than me.

1071
00:52:52.734 --> 00:52:54.345
Why is that horrible?

1072
00:52:54.388 --> 00:52:57.435
So... you would be okay
with dating someone

1073
00:52:57.478 --> 00:52:59.437
who was shitting in their diaper

1074
00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:02.962
when you were getting
your first hand-job?

1075
00:53:03.005 --> 00:53:09.490
Or someone who couldn't count
when you were in college?

1076
00:53:09.534 --> 00:53:12.058
Or someone whose parents
are probably like

1077
00:53:12.101 --> 00:53:14.147
in the grade above you?

1078
00:53:14.191 --> 00:53:16.149
One grade above you?

1079
00:53:16.193 --> 00:53:18.282
I think
you're being prescriptive.

1080
00:53:18.325 --> 00:53:22.155
I think you've watched too many
Woody Allen movies.

1081
00:53:23.243 --> 00:53:24.636
Well. they're romantic.

1082
00:53:24.679 --> 00:53:26.115
- Annie Hall.
- Annie Hall.

1083
00:53:26.159 --> 00:53:27.813
Right. That's movie about...

1084
00:53:27.856 --> 00:53:31.382
a parade of aging neurotics.
crunching their fear of death

1085
00:53:31.425 --> 00:53:35.429
by grabbing onto woman
at the start of their lives

1086
00:53:35.473 --> 00:53:37.301
and then like feeding of them.

1087
00:53:39.259 --> 00:53:40.260
Yeah. Ew.

1088
00:53:40.304 --> 00:53:41.696
Then he made Manhattan

1089
00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:45.352
which is a movie about
dating a teenage girl.

1090
00:53:45.396 --> 00:53:47.876
That starred a real teenage girl

1091
00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:52.838
who he then literally tried
to date afterward in real life.

1092
00:53:52.881 --> 00:53:54.318
Ew.

1093
00:53:54.361 --> 00:53:55.536
See?

1094
00:53:58.670 --> 00:54:00.846
It's just sometimes
people just connect.

1095
00:54:00.889 --> 00:54:03.936
It's not about being attracted
to one another.

1096
00:54:06.808 --> 00:54:10.769
Do you know
a lot of 45-year-old men

1097
00:54:10.812 --> 00:54:13.815
who have
26-year-old female friends?

1098
00:54:13.859 --> 00:54:15.774
Like...

1099
00:54:15.817 --> 00:54:18.255
how many friends
in their 20's do you have?

1100
00:54:21.083 --> 00:54:22.084
I don't know.

1101
00:54:27.351 --> 00:54:28.395
One.

1102
00:54:52.027 --> 00:54:54.334
Ow.

1103
00:55:04.431 --> 00:55:06.215
Can...

1104
00:55:06.259 --> 00:55:08.653
Can you tell me
what a period is?

1105
00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:13.701
What?

1106
00:55:13.745 --> 00:55:16.574
You wanna pull out
the inner tube.

1107
00:55:17.401 --> 00:55:19.359
Until it stops.

1108
00:55:19.403 --> 00:55:21.056
Uh. and then. and then you...

1109
00:55:22.188 --> 00:55:25.147
Uh. and then you...

1110
00:55:25.191 --> 00:55:26.235
Remember?

1111
00:55:26.279 --> 00:55:27.846
Uh. it just get... Um...

1112
00:55:29.369 --> 00:55:30.675
Well. if.
if you're starting out.

1113
00:55:30.718 --> 00:55:33.199
it helps to put your leg up
on something like.

1114
00:55:33.242 --> 00:55:35.244
uh. bathtub or stool.

1115
00:55:35.941 --> 00:55:37.334
Um...

1116
00:55:37.377 --> 00:55:39.336
Because...

1117
00:55:39.379 --> 00:55:40.815
Just so that everything...

1118
00:55:42.643 --> 00:55:45.777
opens up a bit easier. uh...

1119
00:55:46.865 --> 00:55:48.388
and...

1120
00:55:51.696 --> 00:55:54.873
This is just so mortifying.

1121
00:55:54.916 --> 00:55:58.398
This gonna be much more
awkward for Lamp

1122
00:55:58.442 --> 00:56:01.227
so just get through it quickly.

1123
00:56:01.923 --> 00:56:04.404
Yeah. of course.

1124
00:56:04.448 --> 00:56:07.886
So then. um. it gets inserted.

1125
00:56:07.929 --> 00:56:10.236
So. you. uh...

1126
00:56:10.279 --> 00:56:13.282
Um... that's when you insert.
you push it in.

1127
00:56:13.326 --> 00:56:14.936
Okay. insert it where?

1128
00:56:16.416 --> 00:56:18.113
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

1129
00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:22.727
In. uh. vagina.

1130
00:56:23.771 --> 00:56:25.207
You don't whisper it.

1131
00:56:25.251 --> 00:56:27.209
Kids will pick up on that.
That it's. like. shameful.

1132
00:56:27.253 --> 00:56:28.297
Say vagina.

1133
00:56:28.341 --> 00:56:29.734
-Right in the vagina.
-Great.

1134
00:56:29.777 --> 00:56:31.953
-Put it in the vagina.
-Perfect.

1135
00:56:31.997 --> 00:56:34.695
And. and you pushed
until you feel resistance.

1136
00:56:34.739 --> 00:56:36.088
And so then you stop

1137
00:56:36.131 --> 00:56:39.439
and you push in
the little plunger

1138
00:56:39.483 --> 00:56:41.920
and the tampon goes in.

1139
00:56:43.008 --> 00:56:45.402
And... it's in.

1140
00:56:45.445 --> 00:56:48.666
And. and you pull out
the applicator.

1141
00:56:48.709 --> 00:56:50.145
And toss in the trash.

1142
00:56:52.452 --> 00:56:54.628
Oh. my God.

1143
00:56:54.672 --> 00:56:57.152
You expect me to remember that
for like 12 years?

1144
00:56:57.196 --> 00:56:59.198
How embarrassing
was that for you?

1145
00:56:59.241 --> 00:57:00.504
I'm pretty embarrassed.

1146
00:57:01.461 --> 00:57:03.376
Then you'll remember it forever.

1147
00:57:09.164 --> 00:57:10.427
Mm.

1148
00:57:19.566 --> 00:57:20.741
Yes!

1149
00:57:20.785 --> 00:57:22.395
They love it.

1150
00:57:22.439 --> 00:57:24.223
It's. um...

1151
00:57:24.266 --> 00:57:25.485
Oh. you hear it again.

1152
00:57:25.529 --> 00:57:28.183
Two birds with one stone.

1153
00:57:28.227 --> 00:57:30.316
That name's just
on your body forever.

1154
00:57:30.359 --> 00:57:33.406
Right. that's why I got it.
So I could remember something

1155
00:57:33.450 --> 00:57:35.016
that I wished
would have lasted forever.

1156
00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:36.975
Are you worried
that your next partner's

1157
00:57:37.018 --> 00:57:38.237
gonna be bothered by that?

1158
00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:40.021
Why would I based
my decisions now

1159
00:57:40.065 --> 00:57:41.980
about some future
hypothetical asshole?

1160
00:57:42.023 --> 00:57:43.329
Why are they an asshole?

1161
00:57:43.372 --> 00:57:45.462
Because they mind my tattoos.

1162
00:57:45.505 --> 00:57:47.507
The Sams don't mind Celine...

1163
00:57:47.551 --> 00:57:49.553
and Celine never minded Nick.

1164
00:57:49.596 --> 00:57:51.293
You're. you're body
is a graveyard.

1165
00:57:51.337 --> 00:57:53.470
You mean love and loss.
Love and loss.

1166
00:57:53.513 --> 00:57:55.689
If we're not carrying the people
we love with us.

1167
00:57:55.733 --> 00:57:57.996
then what are we even doing?

1168
00:57:58.039 --> 00:58:00.128
-Moving on.
- Okay. well. whatever.

1169
00:58:00.172 --> 00:58:03.610
What about you and that guy?

1170
00:58:03.654 --> 00:58:04.916
We're not a couple.

1171
00:58:04.959 --> 00:58:08.006
Okay.
I know you're not fucking...

1172
00:58:08.049 --> 00:58:11.009
but. like that doesn't mean
that you don't have a thing.

1173
00:58:11.052 --> 00:58:14.099
-We're... we're friends.
- It's something.

1174
00:58:14.142 --> 00:58:15.753
And it's finite.

1175
00:58:15.796 --> 00:58:17.015
Finite. how?

1176
00:58:17.058 --> 00:58:19.626
In that this period will end
at some point.

1177
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:22.455
you will give birth to a child
and then what happens?

1178
00:58:22.499 --> 00:58:24.326
You don't need
to be like a thing

1179
00:58:24.370 --> 00:58:26.590
in the way that you define
in order to breakup.

1180
00:58:26.633 --> 00:58:28.548
Just because you're not
like "together together"

1181
00:58:28.592 --> 00:58:30.681
doesn't mean
that you haven't created a bond.

1182
00:58:30.724 --> 00:58:32.247
You have created a connection

1183
00:58:32.291 --> 00:58:34.511
between the two of you
that will end.

1184
00:58:37.775 --> 00:58:39.080
Also...

1185
00:58:39.124 --> 00:58:41.561
I'm really worried
that you're probably making

1186
00:58:41.605 --> 00:58:43.694
a little straight white guy
in there.

1187
00:58:44.651 --> 00:58:47.567
I am. That's the whole plan.

1188
00:58:47.611 --> 00:58:49.482
I'm gonna...

1189
00:58:49.526 --> 00:58:51.789
I should...
I just give him a podcast.

1190
00:58:51.832 --> 00:58:53.530
-Oh.
- Oh. yeah.

1191
00:58:53.573 --> 00:58:55.401
It's about Reaganomics.
-

1192
00:58:57.446 --> 00:59:00.493
Oh. my God.
speaking of. we're not open!

1193
00:59:00.537 --> 00:59:02.321
I don't know when we open.

1194
00:59:02.364 --> 00:59:04.236
Leave. leave.
We're not open.

1195
00:59:04.279 --> 00:59:06.543
Oh. my God.
I'm gonna call the police.

1196
00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:09.197
You okay?

1197
00:59:09.241 --> 00:59:10.416
Seems like your...

1198
00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:13.767
I seem...

1199
00:59:14.638 --> 00:59:15.813
Off.

1200
00:59:21.079 --> 00:59:22.559
Hormones.

1201
00:59:23.472 --> 00:59:24.648
Probably.

1202
00:59:26.084 --> 00:59:28.608
Oh. what we do with our hormones

1203
00:59:28.652 --> 00:59:30.131
to sum everything up.

1204
00:59:31.829 --> 00:59:35.049
You'd probably invent hormones
to sum everything up with.

1205
00:59:37.008 --> 00:59:40.707
That's... That sounds like
my mom and stepdad.

1206
00:59:40.751 --> 00:59:43.754
I just wanna say thank you
in advance for doing this

1207
00:59:43.797 --> 00:59:46.583
with me and I also apologize
for everyone that I know.

1208
00:59:46.626 --> 00:59:48.454
-There you are!
-Hey!

1209
00:59:48.497 --> 00:59:50.543
-Hi. Oh.
-Hi.

1210
00:59:50.587 --> 00:59:52.632
Your stairs are very slippery.

1211
00:59:52.676 --> 00:59:54.329
You're gonna want to get
some grippy tape.

1212
00:59:54.373 --> 00:59:55.940
-You know what grippy tape is?
-Uh-huh.

1213
00:59:55.983 --> 00:59:57.637
-It's like sandpaper.
-Yeah. Okay.

1214
00:59:57.681 --> 00:59:59.204
-Matthew.
-Hey. Carson. How are you?

1215
00:59:59.247 --> 01:00:01.380
Do you know what kind of tape
I'm talking about. Matt?

1216
01:00:01.423 --> 01:00:02.990
It... You see it
in office buildings.

1217
01:00:03.034 --> 01:00:04.209
Oh. come on in.

1218
01:00:05.123 --> 01:00:06.167
This is Anna.

1219
01:00:06.211 --> 01:00:08.169
-Hi. She's too young for you.
-Hi.

1220
01:00:08.213 --> 01:00:10.432
Yeah. we know.
Nobody is dating anybody.

1221
01:00:10.476 --> 01:00:11.999
Uh. this is my Mom Adele.

1222
01:00:12.043 --> 01:00:13.305
-This is Carson.
-Hello!

1223
01:00:13.348 --> 01:00:15.133
Nice to meet you. May I?

1224
01:00:15.176 --> 01:00:17.352
Mom. you can talk
directly to Anna...

1225
01:00:17.396 --> 01:00:19.006
Oh. my God!

1226
01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:21.487
Oh. my third grandchild
is in there.

1227
01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:23.054
And look how big she is already.

1228
01:00:23.097 --> 01:00:25.752
I mean you were a big baby.
Like father like son. right?

1229
01:00:25.796 --> 01:00:27.058
Or daughter.

1230
01:00:27.101 --> 01:00:29.669
With a belly that big.
let's hope it's a boy.

1231
01:00:31.236 --> 01:00:33.238
Where should I put
these cookies?

1232
01:00:33.281 --> 01:00:34.805
-Um...
- Oh. she doesn't know.

1233
01:00:34.848 --> 01:00:36.763
-Yeah. We brought cookies.
- Great.

1234
01:00:36.807 --> 01:00:38.678
Why do they have
so many plants in here?

1235
01:00:38.722 --> 01:00:41.986
You can have my chaps.
- Always with the chaps.

1236
01:00:42.029 --> 01:00:44.641
I decided
I'm gonna go with Opah.

1237
01:00:44.684 --> 01:00:45.685
Oprah?

1238
01:00:45.729 --> 01:00:46.947
Oh-Pah.

1239
01:00:46.991 --> 01:00:48.688
-It's German.
-We're not German.

1240
01:00:48.732 --> 01:00:51.386
I just like the sound of it.
Somebody's probably German.

1241
01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:52.866
A lot of people are German.

1242
01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:55.739
but you yourself are not
a descendant of any of them.

1243
01:00:55.782 --> 01:00:57.349
I wanna go with Mimi.

1244
01:00:57.392 --> 01:00:59.568
-"Me me".
-Mm-hm.

1245
01:00:59.612 --> 01:01:01.962
Can you do names when you're
related through marriage?

1246
01:01:02.006 --> 01:01:03.094
Adele...

1247
01:01:03.137 --> 01:01:04.486
I'm related.

1248
01:01:04.530 --> 01:01:05.618
Tomato. tom-ah-to.

1249
01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:07.141
What's Carson
gonna be called?

1250
01:01:07.185 --> 01:01:08.577
Carson.
- Carson.

1251
01:01:08.621 --> 01:01:09.970
You know
it's a funny thing

1252
01:01:10.014 --> 01:01:11.624
that was gonna be
my number one choice

1253
01:01:11.668 --> 01:01:13.626
if Opah was already taken.

1254
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:17.674
The humor gene is very strong
with these two. Matty and Marty.

1255
01:01:17.717 --> 01:01:19.240
So what are you gonna be called?

1256
01:01:22.113 --> 01:01:25.943
Um... "That... That Lady"?

1257
01:01:25.986 --> 01:01:27.205
See?

1258
01:01:27.248 --> 01:01:29.686
If you're not related.
you don't do names.

1259
01:01:29.729 --> 01:01:31.862
Organ donors
do not get nicknames.

1260
01:01:31.905 --> 01:01:33.341
Is that what this is like?

1261
01:01:33.385 --> 01:01:35.517
Like donating an organ?

1262
01:01:35.561 --> 01:01:39.130
I don't know. I've never donated
an organ before.

1263
01:01:40.305 --> 01:01:42.350
You must be Dylan's wife?

1264
01:01:42.394 --> 01:01:44.526
No. I'm the surrogate.

1265
01:01:44.570 --> 01:01:46.572
Oh. congrats!

1266
01:01:46.615 --> 01:01:48.487
Um. is that appropriate?

1267
01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:50.271
-Thanks.
-Hey. Shell. Shell!

1268
01:01:50.315 --> 01:01:53.884
Come meet the surrogate!
The. the surrogate!

1269
01:01:53.927 --> 01:01:55.450
-Come here.
- Oh...

1270
01:01:55.494 --> 01:01:58.453
Wow. look at you!

1271
01:01:58.497 --> 01:02:01.152
Oh. you are so big already!

1272
01:02:01.195 --> 01:02:02.806
-I know. right?
-

1273
01:02:02.849 --> 01:02:04.198
That's what I've heard.

1274
01:02:04.242 --> 01:02:05.547
-Oh.
-Oh. wow.

1275
01:02:05.591 --> 01:02:07.767
-Baby's gonna be healthy.
-Yeah. healthy baby.

1276
01:02:12.772 --> 01:02:14.339
How'd you do that?

1277
01:02:15.819 --> 01:02:18.212
Here. I'm sorry...

1278
01:02:26.264 --> 01:02:28.309
All right. let's see here.

1279
01:02:29.876 --> 01:02:32.792
Oh... Oh. come on!

1280
01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:37.841
So good.

1281
01:02:41.061 --> 01:02:43.368
I love it. I love it.

1282
01:02:43.411 --> 01:02:44.848
- Make way.

1283
01:02:44.891 --> 01:02:47.024
-Whoa!
- Perfect!

1284
01:02:47.067 --> 01:02:48.547
This thing is huge!

1285
01:02:48.590 --> 01:02:49.766
Here we go.

1286
01:02:49.809 --> 01:02:50.897
Uh. is it a weapon
or something?

1287
01:02:58.992 --> 01:03:01.821
Oh. yes...

1288
01:03:01.865 --> 01:03:02.996
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1289
01:03:04.737 --> 01:03:06.521
-Thank you. Thank you.
-Yeah.

1290
01:03:11.091 --> 01:03:14.660
Oh. my God. All right.
who's next? Who's next?

1291
01:03:14.703 --> 01:03:15.922
What's this?

1292
01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:20.318
That's a koala bear.

1293
01:03:50.304 --> 01:03:52.959
I'm like craving pizza
right now.

1294
01:03:53.003 --> 01:03:55.266
I think I'm having
a sympathy craving.

1295
01:03:55.309 --> 01:03:57.921
-You always want pizza.
- That's true.

1296
01:03:57.964 --> 01:04:00.488
The question is.
"Do you want pizza?"

1297
01:04:00.532 --> 01:04:03.143
And if you do.
say we order it now or later?

1298
01:04:03.187 --> 01:04:05.754
I should probably go...

1299
01:04:05.798 --> 01:04:07.582
-actually.
- What?

1300
01:04:07.626 --> 01:04:10.194
We're gonna watch season nine
of Friends.

1301
01:04:10.237 --> 01:04:12.152
I think I'm just gonna watch it
at home.

1302
01:04:17.766 --> 01:04:20.073
-Did I do something?
- No.

1303
01:04:20.117 --> 01:04:22.771
I just have to be up
super early tomorrow

1304
01:04:22.815 --> 01:04:25.992
and I've been here all day.

1305
01:04:26.036 --> 01:04:27.994
Thank you for that. by the way.

1306
01:04:28.038 --> 01:04:30.475
Thank you for thanking me.

1307
01:04:31.302 --> 01:04:33.304
Yeah. so that right there.

1308
01:04:33.957 --> 01:04:35.480
What?

1309
01:04:35.523 --> 01:04:37.264
You... you got sad.

1310
01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:42.095
Please...
don't see when I'm sad.

1311
01:04:42.748 --> 01:04:43.836
Please.

1312
01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.185
What's going on?

1313
01:04:47.971 --> 01:04:49.233
I think...

1314
01:04:51.104 --> 01:04:55.892
I think that we should have
better boundaries.

1315
01:05:03.987 --> 01:05:05.945
Was it the party?

1316
01:05:05.989 --> 01:05:07.729
Was it the party? I'm sorry.

1317
01:05:07.773 --> 01:05:09.949
No. Yes. but...

1318
01:05:09.993 --> 01:05:12.996
No. it's. it's... everything.

1319
01:05:13.039 --> 01:05:16.782
It's like we spend
way too much time together.

1320
01:05:16.825 --> 01:05:18.610
I basically only hanging out
with you.

1321
01:05:18.653 --> 01:05:20.351
I don't hang out
with anybody else.

1322
01:05:20.394 --> 01:05:22.440
-What's the point?
-What's the point of what?

1323
01:05:22.483 --> 01:05:24.572
What is the point
of hanging out?

1324
01:05:25.399 --> 01:05:26.444
What?

1325
01:05:26.487 --> 01:05:30.578
We've spent
so much time together.

1326
01:05:30.622 --> 01:05:34.887
And yet you still see me
as like this. like. naive woman.

1327
01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:36.671
-That's not true.
-And you're like...

1328
01:05:36.715 --> 01:05:40.588
You're always trying to. like.
do things for me. like I'm some

1329
01:05:40.632 --> 01:05:42.416
-charity case like...
-What?

1330
01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:44.244
I did stuff on my own.

1331
01:05:44.288 --> 01:05:45.854
I know that!

1332
01:05:45.898 --> 01:05:48.161
Do you... Do you seriously think
I'm that shitty of a friend?

1333
01:05:48.205 --> 01:05:49.554
Okay. "friend".

1334
01:05:49.597 --> 01:05:51.469
Are we friends?

1335
01:05:52.296 --> 01:05:53.340
Are we?

1336
01:05:57.431 --> 01:06:01.218
I. I don't know. I...

1337
01:06:01.261 --> 01:06:06.049
I think that if we are.
in order for this to work.

1338
01:06:06.092 --> 01:06:07.441
we shouldn't be.

1339
01:06:13.752 --> 01:06:15.536
I will see you on Wednesday.

1340
01:06:16.581 --> 01:06:17.625
Okay.

1341
01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:25.068
Hey. I'll. uh.
see you Wednesday.

1342
01:06:26.286 --> 01:06:27.287
Okay.

1343
01:08:09.737 --> 01:08:11.174
I'll send
the doctor right in.

1344
01:08:11.217 --> 01:08:12.436
Thanks.

1345
01:08:15.482 --> 01:08:18.050
What's goin' on?
What's with you two?

1346
01:08:25.884 --> 01:08:27.625
This is how we are now.

1347
01:08:38.026 --> 01:08:39.985
Hey. could you. uh...

1348
01:08:40.028 --> 01:08:43.031
Could you update
the food log again?

1349
01:08:45.643 --> 01:08:47.775
-Uh. sure.
-Great.

1350
01:08:49.037 --> 01:08:50.474
That'd be great 'cause...

1351
01:08:50.517 --> 01:08:56.132
since we're not eating meals
together so much. um...

1352
01:08:56.175 --> 01:08:58.612
it would just be great
to have a sense of...

1353
01:08:58.656 --> 01:08:59.831
Yeah. of course.

1354
01:09:04.227 --> 01:09:05.228
Hi.

1355
01:09:05.271 --> 01:09:06.577
I'm Shayleen.

1356
01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:09.449
Welcome to
Koala House Birth Center

1357
01:09:09.493 --> 01:09:11.625
for Learning and Feeling.

1358
01:09:11.669 --> 01:09:14.715
Um. I love the miracle of birth.

1359
01:09:15.934 --> 01:09:17.240
Even more than that

1360
01:09:17.283 --> 01:09:19.677
I love empowering couples
within the process.

1361
01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:23.768
So it is truly my pleasure

1362
01:09:23.811 --> 01:09:27.293
to be on this journey with you.

1363
01:09:27.337 --> 01:09:30.209
And I'd like to start class
with a cleansing breath.

1364
01:09:47.531 --> 01:09:51.230
I am Matt and this is my baby.

1365
01:09:51.274 --> 01:09:52.884
And you partner?

1366
01:09:52.927 --> 01:09:55.800
Uh. no. She's not my partner.

1367
01:09:55.843 --> 01:09:57.497
We're feminists.

1368
01:09:57.541 --> 01:09:58.759
Um...

1369
01:10:00.718 --> 01:10:03.416
This is Anna.
Uh. she's my surrogate.

1370
01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:08.116
Wonderful. and is there
a third partner?

1371
01:10:10.902 --> 01:10:11.903
No.

1372
01:10:14.253 --> 01:10:15.385
Wonderful.

1373
01:10:18.257 --> 01:10:20.433
Just letting go
of the third partner idea.

1374
01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:24.829
Hi. I'm Ivy.

1375
01:10:24.872 --> 01:10:26.483
Uh. this is Jackie.

1376
01:10:26.526 --> 01:10:29.747
And this is really bonded us
in a way that...

1377
01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:32.793
More so than ever before.
I feel like we are one.

1378
01:10:32.837 --> 01:10:35.056
-Yeah.
-About to be...

1379
01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:36.623
-three.
-Three.

1380
01:10:36.667 --> 01:10:39.844
I love you.
- I love you.

1381
01:10:39.887 --> 01:10:41.411
And you're pushing.
pushing.

1382
01:10:41.454 --> 01:10:43.717
pushing. pushing. pushing.
And you're getting through it.

1383
01:10:43.761 --> 01:10:45.937
And you're getting through it
and you're surviving.

1384
01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:47.808
And then you gonna push.

1385
01:10:48.766 --> 01:10:50.246
And then you got your baby.

1386
01:10:51.029 --> 01:10:52.813
Just breathe.

1387
01:10:52.857 --> 01:10:56.164
Breathe in
your partner's support. Good.

1388
01:10:56.208 --> 01:10:57.905
Breathe.

1389
01:10:57.949 --> 01:11:00.299
And I definitely
recommend late-clamping.

1390
01:11:00.343 --> 01:11:02.388
And you can still do
skin-to-skin.

1391
01:11:02.432 --> 01:11:04.216
Well. just flop 'em right on you

1392
01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:06.262
while you wait
the four to seven minutes

1393
01:11:06.305 --> 01:11:08.612
for the pulsing
to conclude. okay?

1394
01:11:08.655 --> 01:11:11.919
The umbilical cord doesn't have
a lot of reach. Don't pull it.

1395
01:11:11.963 --> 01:11:14.052
Baby will be here.

1396
01:11:14.095 --> 01:11:16.446
Not here. Here.

1397
01:11:16.489 --> 01:11:18.186
I just wanna say...

1398
01:11:18.230 --> 01:11:21.799
I think what you are doing
is so brave.

1399
01:11:21.842 --> 01:11:22.930
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1400
01:11:25.411 --> 01:11:28.066
Okay. move to the hips.

1401
01:11:28.109 --> 01:11:29.589
Move to the hips.

1402
01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:32.375
Yes.

1403
01:11:32.418 --> 01:11:35.595
What about our situation?

1404
01:11:35.639 --> 01:11:38.294
Yeah. I... obviously
won't be doing skin-to-skin.

1405
01:11:38.337 --> 01:11:39.512
But Papa can.

1406
01:11:39.556 --> 01:11:41.209
All the Papas can.

1407
01:11:41.253 --> 01:11:43.821
You just wanna wear shirt
that can easily open up

1408
01:11:43.864 --> 01:11:46.084
and then we just pull up
a little stool.

1409
01:11:46.127 --> 01:11:47.520
Sit right there.

1410
01:11:47.564 --> 01:11:49.566
-And he'll do the skin-to-skin.
- Breathe.

1411
01:11:51.394 --> 01:11:53.526
-Breathe.
-

1412
01:11:53.570 --> 01:11:55.659
Anyway. good luck.

1413
01:11:55.702 --> 01:11:56.877
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1414
01:11:58.444 --> 01:11:59.489
You too.

1415
01:11:59.532 --> 01:12:00.751
So just to be clear...

1416
01:12:00.794 --> 01:12:03.057
he would be on a stool

1417
01:12:03.101 --> 01:12:06.757
between my legs
for four to seven minutes

1418
01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:09.455
while the baby
is still tethered to me...

1419
01:12:10.108 --> 01:12:11.544
my insides?

1420
01:12:11.588 --> 01:12:14.025
Yes. Is that a problem?

1421
01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:21.598
Standing position two.

1422
01:12:24.601 --> 01:12:26.690
Now let's practice
the words of encouragement

1423
01:12:26.733 --> 01:12:28.169
that we talked about.

1424
01:12:32.565 --> 01:12:35.089
This is really important.

1425
01:12:41.922 --> 01:12:45.448
You really. uh...
You doing. you doing okay.

1426
01:12:48.538 --> 01:12:50.496
You're doing really good.

1427
01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:51.802
You're doing good.

1428
01:12:53.543 --> 01:12:54.848
You're the best.

1429
01:12:58.678 --> 01:13:00.027
You're the best.

1430
01:13:14.564 --> 01:13:15.652
Ah...

1431
01:13:41.678 --> 01:13:43.854
Hi. um...

1432
01:13:43.897 --> 01:13:46.378
Uh. so this is happening.

1433
01:13:49.294 --> 01:13:52.645
There's no signs
of a rupture or vasa previa.

1434
01:13:52.689 --> 01:13:54.125
placenta is in good shape.

1435
01:13:54.168 --> 01:13:57.171
Baby's heartbeat is strong.
movement is normal.

1436
01:13:57.215 --> 01:13:59.739
All signs point to pre-labor...

1437
01:13:59.783 --> 01:14:01.828
But she... she's only 34 weeks.

1438
01:14:01.872 --> 01:14:03.787
Pre-labor doesn't always mean
labor is close.

1439
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:06.616
You're only 25 percent effaced.

1440
01:14:06.659 --> 01:14:08.400
But the baby
is sitting very low.

1441
01:14:08.444 --> 01:14:09.836
I recommend staying off
your feet.

1442
01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:36.123
I never picture this...

1443
01:14:37.168 --> 01:14:41.389
being friends or...

1444
01:14:41.433 --> 01:14:42.478
I don't think...

1445
01:14:45.959 --> 01:14:48.658
All the reading in pamphlets
and stuff about...

1446
01:14:50.529 --> 01:14:53.619
separating from the baby like...

1447
01:14:54.707 --> 01:14:56.056
There's...

1448
01:14:58.145 --> 01:15:01.235
There's nothing about
like losing the Dad.

1449
01:15:02.933 --> 01:15:04.021
Hey.

1450
01:15:06.458 --> 01:15:08.112
We're not gonna lose each other.

1451
01:15:09.635 --> 01:15:14.161
You're gonna have Lamp
and I'm gonna be in Vermont

1452
01:15:14.205 --> 01:15:15.902
-and...
-What?

1453
01:15:18.644 --> 01:15:21.821
I... I got into school.

1454
01:15:23.214 --> 01:15:26.739
-You got into school?
-Yeah.

1455
01:15:26.783 --> 01:15:28.654
-Get out of here.
-

1456
01:15:31.570 --> 01:15:33.093
You kidding me?

1457
01:15:34.617 --> 01:15:37.881
Oh. my God. I'm so proud of you.

1458
01:15:37.924 --> 01:15:40.971
-Not in a dad-way. just...
-I know...

1459
01:15:42.102 --> 01:15:44.496
I... congratulations.

1460
01:15:47.978 --> 01:15:50.676
-Why are you crying?
-

1461
01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:52.635
I don't know because...

1462
01:15:53.897 --> 01:15:55.376
Because I love you.

1463
01:15:59.555 --> 01:16:00.947
You love me how?

1464
01:16:00.991 --> 01:16:03.950
Like in a... Like a normal way.

1465
01:16:03.994 --> 01:16:05.952
-Like a not a gross way.
-Yeah.

1466
01:16:05.996 --> 01:16:09.086
Like. like a boring way. Like...

1467
01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:20.140
I love you too. by the way.

1468
01:16:20.184 --> 01:16:21.664
Hope that's obvious.

1469
01:16:25.493 --> 01:16:26.582
I know.

1470
01:16:32.196 --> 01:16:33.284
I know.

1471
01:17:05.446 --> 01:17:06.665
Look. it rolls.

1472
01:17:30.689 --> 01:17:32.299
Why are you groaning?

1473
01:17:32.343 --> 01:17:35.041
This is harder
than I thought it would be.

1474
01:17:43.354 --> 01:17:46.444
The show is so fucking dumb.

1475
01:17:50.361 --> 01:17:53.103
Cross it over
into the middle.

1476
01:17:53.146 --> 01:17:56.497
Then take some hair
on the same side.

1477
01:17:56.541 --> 01:17:58.282
This looks good.

1478
01:17:58.325 --> 01:18:01.372
So you must be getting
pretty excited.

1479
01:18:03.766 --> 01:18:05.115
Yeah.

1480
01:18:05.158 --> 01:18:07.421
Uh. very nervous.

1481
01:18:07.465 --> 01:18:09.119
Very excited.

1482
01:18:09.162 --> 01:18:11.251
I don't know what I'm in for.
There's no way to know

1483
01:18:11.295 --> 01:18:13.253
until you're. you're.
you're doing it. I guess.

1484
01:18:13.297 --> 01:18:17.083
So. yeah. excited. nervous.
but good nervous.

1485
01:18:17.127 --> 01:18:20.913
Um.
my mucus plug dropped.

1486
01:18:20.957 --> 01:18:23.655
And I've had my bloody show.

1487
01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:25.918
Our bloody show? Sorry.

1488
01:18:25.962 --> 01:18:28.660
-Our bloody show.
-I think you can say yours.

1489
01:18:29.922 --> 01:18:31.707
Uh. no.
I think it's our bloody show.

1490
01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:33.317
Is it?
- Yeah.

1491
01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:35.885
You know since you pushed me
on it. it's your bloody show.

1492
01:18:35.928 --> 01:18:38.888
-It's his bloody show
-Well. it's my bloody show.

1493
01:18:38.931 --> 01:18:41.673
Is that gross to...
Is that gross to tell you?

1494
01:18:41.717 --> 01:18:44.197
I'm here to. to hear whatever...

1495
01:18:44.241 --> 01:18:46.591
whatever it is
that you want to tell me.

1496
01:18:49.246 --> 01:18:51.422
Anything else
that you like to discuss?

1497
01:18:51.465 --> 01:18:52.815
We finished Friends.

1498
01:18:55.295 --> 01:18:57.167
Yeah. we did.

1499
01:18:57.210 --> 01:19:00.300
We watched all of Friends.

1500
01:19:15.794 --> 01:19:17.274
Do you want to. um...

1501
01:19:18.057 --> 01:19:20.320
hold hands and eat candy

1502
01:19:20.364 --> 01:19:22.583
and continue
not sleeping together?

1503
01:19:26.239 --> 01:19:27.763
I thought you'd never ask.

1504
01:19:58.315 --> 01:19:59.359
Matt.

1505
01:20:00.186 --> 01:20:01.231
Matt.

1506
01:20:01.274 --> 01:20:02.275
Yeah.

1507
01:20:02.319 --> 01:20:04.364
-I...
-What is it. Anna?

1508
01:20:04.408 --> 01:20:05.713
I had a contraction.

1509
01:20:05.757 --> 01:20:07.803
It's early. right? It's early.

1510
01:20:07.846 --> 01:20:09.065
Oh. you're early?

1511
01:20:09.108 --> 01:20:11.632
Uh. I. I not like scary early.

1512
01:20:11.676 --> 01:20:12.764
I think it's like a week.

1513
01:20:12.808 --> 01:20:14.200
-right?
-Okay.

1514
01:20:14.244 --> 01:20:15.985
Time it. We have to time it.

1515
01:20:16.028 --> 01:20:17.160
That's...

1516
01:20:18.683 --> 01:20:21.164
Time. Uh. I gotta get my phone.

1517
01:20:21.207 --> 01:20:24.123
Okay. Could you give me
some water. first?

1518
01:20:24.167 --> 01:20:25.864
Yes. water. Water.

1519
01:20:25.908 --> 01:20:27.083
Okay.

1520
01:20:38.137 --> 01:20:40.183
Why didn't you do that earlier?

1521
01:20:40.226 --> 01:20:41.575
I don't know!

1522
01:21:05.295 --> 01:21:07.558
You're supposed
to be encouraging me!

1523
01:21:07.601 --> 01:21:10.343
You're doing great!

1524
01:21:10.387 --> 01:21:11.997
Aw!
-You're doing so good!

1525
01:21:12.041 --> 01:21:13.303
Just. uh...

1526
01:21:13.346 --> 01:21:15.653
I don't believe anything
you're saying right now!

1527
01:21:33.453 --> 01:21:36.152
How... how far apart
are they now?

1528
01:21:36.195 --> 01:21:38.458
That's. uh. well. eight minutes.

1529
01:21:39.111 --> 01:21:40.634
-Still?
-Yeah.

1530
01:21:43.463 --> 01:21:45.813
Here we go. Nice and cold.

1531
01:21:45.857 --> 01:21:47.119
Just like you like it.

1532
01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:49.948
-There you go.
-Thanks.

1533
01:21:49.992 --> 01:21:51.689
-Whoa! Whoa! Oh. my God!

1534
01:21:51.732 --> 01:21:53.952
-Whoa! Are you okay?
-I... yeah.

1535
01:21:53.996 --> 01:21:56.302
Oh. wow! I... I gonna go...

1536
01:21:56.346 --> 01:21:57.695
I gonna go get...

1537
01:21:57.738 --> 01:21:59.871
-What?
-I. I gotta have a button-down

1538
01:21:59.915 --> 01:22:01.394
-for skin-on-skin.
-Okay.

1539
01:22:01.438 --> 01:22:02.700
This is. uh... This is it!

1540
01:22:02.743 --> 01:22:04.615
Can you get... Can you get me
a pair of pants?

1541
01:22:04.658 --> 01:22:05.659
Yes!

1542
01:22:06.225 --> 01:22:07.270
Okay. too fast.

1543
01:22:07.313 --> 01:22:08.445
-You're going too fast.
-Okay.

1544
01:22:08.488 --> 01:22:10.099
It's happening.

1545
01:22:10.142 --> 01:22:11.578
Okay.

1546
01:22:11.622 --> 01:22:13.580
Date today.
Oh. my God. what is today?

1547
01:22:13.624 --> 01:22:15.365
Today. today is Lamp's birthday.
What is it?

1548
01:22:19.804 --> 01:22:21.458
Good. You wanna sit down now?

1549
01:22:21.501 --> 01:22:23.373
No? Keep moving.
keep moving. All right.

1550
01:22:34.558 --> 01:22:36.821
You're doing great!
-

1551
01:22:44.437 --> 01:22:46.439
Do you want some. uh...

1552
01:22:46.483 --> 01:22:50.008
like some ice cream
down the hall or...

1553
01:22:50.052 --> 01:22:52.619
I don't want... I don't think
I can have ice cream.

1554
01:22:52.663 --> 01:22:54.143
Yeah. Okay.

1555
01:22:54.186 --> 01:22:55.448
There you go.

1556
01:22:59.670 --> 01:23:03.500
Okay. if you want the epidural.
it's now or never.

1557
01:23:03.543 --> 01:23:04.980
Yes. I want the...

1558
01:23:06.459 --> 01:23:08.809
Keep it up! Push! Good. good!

1559
01:23:08.853 --> 01:23:10.550
Bear down. Push!

1560
01:23:10.594 --> 01:23:12.074
- Push!

1561
01:23:12.857 --> 01:23:14.511
Okay. Push. Anna.

1562
01:23:14.554 --> 01:23:15.686
Push!

1563
01:23:15.729 --> 01:23:18.036
Push! Push!

1564
01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:19.733
Push!

1565
01:23:19.777 --> 01:23:21.039
Push. Anna!

1566
01:23:22.345 --> 01:23:23.911
Don't stop now. Anna.

1567
01:23:23.955 --> 01:23:25.174
You can rest in a minute.

1568
01:23:25.217 --> 01:23:27.698
Push. Anna. Push. push!

1569
01:23:27.741 --> 01:23:30.657
-You can do this. Push!

1570
01:23:31.571 --> 01:23:33.965
Push. push. push!

1571
01:23:34.009 --> 01:23:38.143
Push. Anna.
Good. good! We're crowning!

1572
01:23:38.187 --> 01:23:41.016
Okay. we're gonna push again
in another 30 seconds.

1573
01:23:41.059 --> 01:23:42.713
-"We".
- Oh. my God.

1574
01:23:42.756 --> 01:23:44.062
I can see...

1575
01:23:44.106 --> 01:23:46.282
I can see Lamp's head!

1576
01:23:46.325 --> 01:23:47.674
Lamp has hair!

1577
01:23:50.677 --> 01:23:54.029
You are so amazing.

1578
01:23:54.072 --> 01:23:55.900
I'm really happy for you.

1579
01:23:58.816 --> 01:24:01.123
Okay. Anna. here we go!

1580
01:24:01.166 --> 01:24:02.907
Take a deep breath.

1581
01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:06.215
-Push! Push!

1582
01:24:06.258 --> 01:24:08.478
Good. good. That's right.

1583
01:24:09.566 --> 01:24:10.654
Push!

1584
01:24:13.048 --> 01:24:14.745
There you go!

1585
01:24:14.788 --> 01:24:16.486
We got it!

1586
01:24:32.371 --> 01:24:34.591
Oh. God!

1587
01:24:34.634 --> 01:24:36.723
Oh. my God!
