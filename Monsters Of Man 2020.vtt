00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.357
Oh. shit. shit. shit.

4
00:00:47.031 --> 00:00:47.865
Oh. fuck.

5
00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.343
Hurry it up.

6
00:02:31.368 --> 00:02:32.003
Yes?

7
00:02:32.036 --> 00:02:32.670
Sir. we've landed.

8
00:02:32.703 --> 00:02:34.604
Are you we still an all go?

9
00:02:34.638 --> 00:02:35.639
We are a go.

10
00:02:36.808 --> 00:02:38.475
Okay. I was thinking we could.

11
00:02:39.944 --> 00:02:42.445
- Are we on?
- Looks like it.

12
00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:44.015
Is it gonna be this hot the
whole time?

13
00:02:44.048 --> 00:02:45.049
What do you think?

14
00:02:46.117 --> 00:02:47.551
This humidity's gonna
be hell on the computers.

15
00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:48.552
Anybody plan for that?

16
00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:50.087
You don't think this
country has computers?

17
00:02:50.121 --> 00:02:51.388
The guy knows.

18
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:53.991
The guy. the guy. where is the
guy?

19
00:02:54.025 --> 00:02:57.795
Oh!

20
00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:58.830
Foster team?

21
00:02:58.863 --> 00:02:59.864
Yep.

22
00:03:02.834 --> 00:03:03.835
I'm Jantz.

23
00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:05.670
Okay.

24
00:03:05.703 --> 00:03:07.972
This is Fielding and Kroger.

25
00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:10.540
Your guy?

26
00:03:10.574 --> 00:03:11.976
Not my guy.

27
00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:13.077
- Your name?
- Boller.

28
00:03:14.011 --> 00:03:15.378
Did the gear arrive?

29
00:03:15.412 --> 00:03:16.814
Already at the house.

30
00:03:16.848 --> 00:03:17.849
Fine.

31
00:03:27.725 --> 00:03:29.160
Hand that up.

32
00:03:29.193 --> 00:03:30.627
Would you relax?

33
00:03:31.662 --> 00:03:32.663
Are you kidding me?

34
00:03:34.732 --> 00:03:36.100
Hey. does the AC work. man?

35
00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:40.671
Can you at least open a freaking
window?

36
00:03:40.705 --> 00:03:43.007
Hey. it's great.

37
00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:45.810
Fine.

38
00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:19.710
We get out here.

39
00:04:25.615 --> 00:04:26.616
How much is that?

40
00:04:28.953 --> 00:04:29.887
Smooth.

41
00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:30.922
Keep the change.

42
00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:49.874
Are you shitting me?

43
00:04:49.907 --> 00:04:53.543
We're above a sweatshop.
no AC. not even fans?

44
00:04:53.576 --> 00:04:55.046
- Seriously. the fuck?
- It is was it is.

45
00:04:55.079 --> 00:04:56.080
We got this.

46
00:04:58.816 --> 00:05:00.084
Thank you. Jesus.

47
00:05:03.921 --> 00:05:05.690
Which one of you two is
coming to set up that link?

48
00:05:05.723 --> 00:05:07.624
'Cause I know it isn't him.

49
00:05:07.658 --> 00:05:08.558
It's me.

50
00:05:08.591 --> 00:05:09.694
Grab your gear and let's move.

51
00:05:09.727 --> 00:05:11.461
We've got a two hour drive.

52
00:05:13.264 --> 00:05:16.200
Get set up. we'll
communicate once we're synced.

53
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:33.718
Go.

54
00:05:34.852 --> 00:05:36.220
OPS team secured.

55
00:05:36.253 --> 00:05:38.022
Tech Jantz on route to Alpha.

56
00:05:39.657 --> 00:05:40.623
Confirmed.

57
00:05:47.131 --> 00:05:48.531
Who are you talking to?

58
00:05:50.267 --> 00:05:52.269
You do know why we're here.
right?

59
00:05:52.303 --> 00:05:53.603
Yeah. yeah.

60
00:05:55.272 --> 00:05:56.273
Sure.

61
00:06:17.261 --> 00:06:20.064
Hey. Leap. toss me up that
hammer.

62
00:06:29.774 --> 00:06:31.842
Leap. Leap. Leap!

63
00:06:31.876 --> 00:06:33.177
Leap!

64
00:06:37.381 --> 00:06:38.182
I'm sorry.

65
00:06:38.215 --> 00:06:39.216
It's fine.

66
00:06:48.726 --> 00:06:50.194
That alarm goes off every day.

67
00:06:55.866 --> 00:06:59.602
Look. I don't wanna be rude.
okay?

68
00:06:59.636 --> 00:07:00.838
It's only a watch.

69
00:07:10.815 --> 00:07:12.316
You can eat with us. if you
like.

70
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.734
Pull up here.

71
00:08:01.899 --> 00:08:02.900
Hello.

72
00:08:03.767 --> 00:08:04.768
Thanks.

73
00:08:08.038 --> 00:08:08.873
Can't believe they've got us
working

74
00:08:08.906 --> 00:08:10.407
on those multi-million dollar
toys.

75
00:08:10.441 --> 00:08:12.109
and they shack us up in this
dump.

76
00:08:12.143 --> 00:08:13.410
Freaking tightwads.

77
00:08:13.444 --> 00:08:15.012
Have connection.

78
00:08:19.216 --> 00:08:20.017
My names?

79
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.286
I'm coding the new combat
program.

80
00:08:22.319 --> 00:08:23.320
Wait. combat?

81
00:08:24.255 --> 00:08:25.122
Not for this exercise.

82
00:08:25.156 --> 00:08:26.824
It's just a nav test.

83
00:08:26.857 --> 00:08:28.092
Right?

84
00:08:28.125 --> 00:08:30.394
You do realize that we work
for a weapons company. right?

85
00:08:53.784 --> 00:08:55.252
The drug runners probably set
this up.

86
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.721
You can tell by the amount of
tracks.

87
00:08:57.755 --> 00:08:59.223
people stepping over it.

88
00:08:59.256 --> 00:09:00.824
The locals know it's here.

89
00:09:36.961 --> 00:09:39.196
Jordan.
stop. stop. stop. Jordan!

90
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:41.232
- Sorry.
- What the hell?

91
00:09:42.433 --> 00:09:43.434
Watch out.

92
00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:47.271
Oh. goddamn it.

93
00:09:50.507 --> 00:09:52.109
Engine's toast.

94
00:09:52.142 --> 00:09:54.278
This is bullshit. who does this?

95
00:09:54.311 --> 00:09:55.346
Someone that obviously doesn't
want

96
00:09:55.379 --> 00:09:57.114
us to go any further.

97
00:09:57.147 --> 00:09:57.982
Why don't we just grab our
packs

98
00:09:58.015 --> 00:09:59.483
and start walking back the way
we came?

99
00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:01.151
We've been on this
road for like five hours.

100
00:10:01.185 --> 00:10:01.852
We haven't seen any...

101
00:10:01.885 --> 00:10:03.354
No. if this map is correct.

102
00:10:03.387 --> 00:10:05.222
there's a tiny village
around here somewhere.

103
00:10:05.256 --> 00:10:07.157
You guys are sure you have
the map the right way up?

104
00:10:07.191 --> 00:10:08.025
- Jordan!
- What?

105
00:10:08.058 --> 00:10:08.859
Shut up!

106
00:10:08.892 --> 00:10:10.394
Why are you always such a smart
ass?

107
00:10:10.427 --> 00:10:11.328
I'm just trying to bring a
little...

108
00:10:11.362 --> 00:10:13.030
Guys. come on. all right?

109
00:10:13.063 --> 00:10:14.498
I say we just stick to the
map. for what it's worth.

110
00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:16.333
It's already getting
dark. and Jordan's right.

111
00:10:16.367 --> 00:10:17.935
we haven't seen anything for
miles.

112
00:10:17.968 --> 00:10:18.969
- Go.
- Just grab our packs

113
00:10:19.003 --> 00:10:21.805
- and start walking.
- You guys. everyone says

114
00:10:21.839 --> 00:10:23.173
the Golden Triangle is full of
opium.

115
00:10:23.207 --> 00:10:25.175
heroin. pot runners. and
landmines.

116
00:10:25.209 --> 00:10:28.178
Us all being doctors.
they might leave us alone.

117
00:10:28.212 --> 00:10:30.047
You know. I don't think the
landmines

118
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.315
can tell if we're doctors or
not. Dez.

119
00:10:31.348 --> 00:10:33.384
Jordan. shut up!

120
00:10:33.417 --> 00:10:34.918
Hey. I mean. no one
goes into the theater

121
00:10:34.952 --> 00:10:38.055
expecting to get killed or raped
or skint

122
00:10:38.088 --> 00:10:40.291
or blown up or any of
these sort of things!

123
00:10:40.324 --> 00:10:41.292
Hey. if I've got the map.

124
00:10:41.325 --> 00:10:42.192
can you show me if we're
in the Golden Triangle?

125
00:10:42.226 --> 00:10:44.295
You're really starting to
scare me.

126
00:10:44.328 --> 00:10:46.297
You need to relax. okay?

127
00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.499
Which way. Angie. Tien?

128
00:10:48.532 --> 00:10:49.199
- This way.
- Over there.

129
00:10:49.233 --> 00:10:51.201
- Oh. fuck.
- Wait a minute.

130
00:10:51.235 --> 00:10:52.336
This is not gonna end well.

131
00:10:52.369 --> 00:10:54.405
- Jordan. just...
- Just chill. okay?

132
00:10:54.438 --> 00:10:56.540
- All right?
- Calm. girlfriend.

133
00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:58.342
All right. if we stick
to these well-worn tracks.

134
00:10:58.375 --> 00:10:59.543
we should be fine.

135
00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:01.812
We should be fine or we will
be fine?

136
00:11:02.646 --> 00:11:03.881
Stick with me. Dez.

137
00:11:18.295 --> 00:11:19.496
Set up here.

138
00:11:36.146 --> 00:11:36.980
Kroger. are you there?

139
00:11:37.014 --> 00:11:37.648
Are you there?

140
00:11:37.682 --> 00:11:39.049
Yo.

141
00:11:39.083 --> 00:11:40.884
Hey. the link is at 75%.

142
00:11:40.918 --> 00:11:42.953
Just pan it left or right a tad.

143
00:11:45.122 --> 00:11:46.623
Perfect. done. lock it off.

144
00:11:48.058 --> 00:11:49.626
Is Fielding set up?

145
00:11:49.661 --> 00:11:50.662
Okay. we're live.

146
00:11:50.695 --> 00:11:51.528
Okay. good.

147
00:11:51.562 --> 00:11:53.130
The drop is in 4.5 hours.

148
00:11:53.163 --> 00:11:54.331
We're gonna head back.

149
00:11:54.365 --> 00:11:55.366
Copy that.

150
00:11:58.268 --> 00:11:59.103
What's that?

151
00:11:59.136 --> 00:12:00.337
It's a backup plan.

152
00:12:00.371 --> 00:12:01.505
Backup plan for what?

153
00:12:02.973 --> 00:12:04.174
Is it up?

154
00:12:04.208 --> 00:12:05.342
- Yeah.
- Good.

155
00:12:06.543 --> 00:12:08.112
Cover it up.

156
00:12:08.145 --> 00:12:10.214
Let's get the hell outta here.

157
00:12:12.383 --> 00:12:13.984
Go.

158
00:12:14.017 --> 00:12:15.953
Connectives are 2-4-3-2-6-7

159
00:12:15.986 --> 00:12:18.055
into our team's cameras and
comms.

160
00:12:18.088 --> 00:12:19.623
Who's this. sir?

161
00:12:19.657 --> 00:12:20.658
CIA.

162
00:12:20.692 --> 00:12:21.693
Oh. shit!

163
00:12:21.726 --> 00:12:26.930
Okay.

164
00:12:29.099 --> 00:12:31.068
Okay. he's in.

165
00:12:31.101 --> 00:12:33.170
I thought this was for
an internal test. sir.

166
00:12:33.203 --> 00:12:34.204
Enough questions.

167
00:12:34.238 --> 00:12:36.573
They're watching closely.
so make it perfect.

168
00:12:36.607 --> 00:12:38.475
Objectives may change. stay
flexible.

169
00:12:39.576 --> 00:12:40.344
Changes?

170
00:12:40.377 --> 00:12:43.080
What the fuck he's talking
about?

171
00:12:43.113 --> 00:12:45.182
Code change?

172
00:12:50.387 --> 00:12:51.689
Jantz.

173
00:12:51.723 --> 00:12:54.591
Do you know anything
about an objective change?

174
00:12:54.625 --> 00:12:55.559
No. who said it?

175
00:13:00.732 --> 00:13:01.666
Keep your fucking
mouth shut.

176
00:13:01.699 --> 00:13:02.700
keep your mouth shut!

177
00:13:04.234 --> 00:13:05.536
Shh. shh. shh.

178
00:13:15.479 --> 00:13:16.480
Fuck!

179
00:13:19.516 --> 00:13:21.552
Who was that. motherfucking drug
runners?

180
00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:28.425
One last time. stay quiet!

181
00:13:33.665 --> 00:13:35.299
Angie. are you
sure this is the right way?

182
00:13:35.332 --> 00:13:37.201
Girl. I told you. I
got this.

183
00:13:37.234 --> 00:13:38.268
Who gave Angie the map?

184
00:13:38.302 --> 00:13:40.170
Yeah. who gave Angie the
map in the first place?

185
00:13:40.204 --> 00:13:42.206
Oh. time out. y'all.

186
00:13:42.239 --> 00:13:43.373
I need a drink.

187
00:13:43.407 --> 00:13:44.408
Yeah. me. too.

188
00:13:47.211 --> 00:13:48.780
Hey. Tien. are your parents
happy

189
00:13:48.813 --> 00:13:51.281
that you're going to a
medical school in Chicago?

190
00:13:51.315 --> 00:13:53.584
I hope so. they're
helping me pay for it.

191
00:13:53.617 --> 00:13:55.653
Well. I don't know how
much you'll learn in Chicago.

192
00:13:55.687 --> 00:13:57.554
Jordan. why are you so mean to
me?

193
00:13:57.588 --> 00:13:59.122
Look. in Tien's defense.

194
00:13:59.156 --> 00:14:01.225
it's actually a pretty good
college.

195
00:14:01.258 --> 00:14:02.125
We did our research and...

196
00:14:02.159 --> 00:14:03.293
Shh. shh!

197
00:14:04.461 --> 00:14:05.730
- Y'all hear that?
- What?

198
00:14:20.377 --> 00:14:21.044
What was that?

199
00:14:21.078 --> 00:14:22.312
I almost fainted with that.

200
00:14:22.346 --> 00:14:23.614
Me. too.

201
00:14:23.647 --> 00:14:25.282
Man up. guys. it was a bunch
of kids.

202
00:14:25.315 --> 00:14:27.351
Yeah. with guns. Jordan.

203
00:14:27.384 --> 00:14:29.386
Hey. actually. I don't feel so
lost now.

204
00:14:29.419 --> 00:14:30.755
Ha. ha. you're so funny.

205
00:14:40.765 --> 00:14:42.132
Cutting it close. guys.

206
00:14:42.165 --> 00:14:43.467
- We set?
- Good to go.

207
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:44.635
Is my team logged in?

208
00:14:45.536 --> 00:14:46.503
Team?

209
00:14:46.537 --> 00:14:47.337
What team?

210
00:14:47.371 --> 00:14:49.106
CIA. apparently. Foster's
orders.

211
00:14:49.139 --> 00:14:51.542
CIA. this is fucking getting
serious!

212
00:14:51.575 --> 00:14:53.745
Well. we're dropping
a secret team of robots

213
00:14:53.778 --> 00:14:55.713
into a country that we're
not supposed to be in.

214
00:14:55.747 --> 00:14:57.581
It got serious the moment we
start up.

215
00:14:59.416 --> 00:15:00.584
- Fuck.
- Bad habit of knocking.

216
00:15:00.617 --> 00:15:02.419
- Are we connected?
- Yes. cowboy.

217
00:15:03.655 --> 00:15:07.591
Alpha. Quebec. 9-0-0-9 Alpha.
confirmed.

218
00:15:08.492 --> 00:15:10.494
Confirmed. line is secure.

219
00:15:10.527 --> 00:15:12.596
Drop is in 15 minutes.

220
00:15:12.629 --> 00:15:14.164
Establishing links now.

221
00:15:14.197 --> 00:15:16.466
Comms one through four
confirmed.

222
00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.169
We should have solid comms
when they're all on the ground.

223
00:15:33.785 --> 00:15:34.752
Got on the wrong one.

224
00:15:34.786 --> 00:15:36.253
Look. a plane!

225
00:15:36.286 --> 00:15:37.220
Help!

226
00:15:37.254 --> 00:15:38.322
Did you say plane?

227
00:15:38.355 --> 00:15:40.257
Angie. there's no way they can
see us.

228
00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:52.235
Four's picking up speed.

229
00:15:55.639 --> 00:15:56.841
Chutes aren't opening all the
way.

230
00:15:56.874 --> 00:15:58.442
- Want me to blow it?
- No!

231
00:15:58.475 --> 00:16:00.344
And let everyone in the
area know that we're here?

232
00:16:00.377 --> 00:16:01.378
We let it go.

233
00:16:03.815 --> 00:16:05.582
Well. it's landed.

234
00:16:05.616 --> 00:16:06.617
Signal's lost.

235
00:16:07.685 --> 00:16:08.585
Major.

236
00:16:08.619 --> 00:16:09.754
Continue with the operation.

237
00:16:09.787 --> 00:16:11.889
No noise until we complete the
objective.

238
00:16:14.558 --> 00:16:15.927
You gotta be shitting me.

239
00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.227
We'll let the other
three robots detonate

240
00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.296
number four after the operation.

241
00:16:21.833 --> 00:16:23.467
Sending go codes now.

242
00:16:55.565 --> 00:16:58.703
We have solid comms with
One. Two. and Three.

243
00:16:58.736 --> 00:16:59.937
Four is dead.

244
00:16:59.971 --> 00:17:01.304
- Shit!
- What?

245
00:17:01.338 --> 00:17:02.740
Damn engineers!

246
00:17:02.774 --> 00:17:05.910
We told them that the comm
modules weren't sitting tightly.

247
00:17:05.943 --> 00:17:07.310
And if we lose connection
with the modules.

248
00:17:07.344 --> 00:17:08.412
they become free agents.

249
00:17:08.445 --> 00:17:09.981
Meaning you have no control.

250
00:17:10.014 --> 00:17:10.682
Sort of.

251
00:17:10.715 --> 00:17:11.716
No module means that they're...

252
00:17:11.749 --> 00:17:12.850
Dumb terminators.

253
00:17:12.884 --> 00:17:14.719
No module. no objective.

254
00:17:14.752 --> 00:17:16.988
Kroger's terminology is
slightly exaggerated. okay?

255
00:17:17.021 --> 00:17:21.258
Look it. in layman's terms.
they have two brains. okay?

256
00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:24.261
One is the module that caps
their artificial intelligence.

257
00:17:24.294 --> 00:17:26.530
that allows us to communicate
with them.

258
00:17:26.563 --> 00:17:28.632
The module also allows
them to make the best

259
00:17:28.666 --> 00:17:30.001
decisions in the field possible.

260
00:17:30.034 --> 00:17:32.770
whether that be jumping
off a cliff or not.

261
00:17:32.804 --> 00:17:36.007
or when would be the appropriate
time to pull out a gun.

262
00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.241
We can set objectives.
we can dictate orders.

263
00:17:38.275 --> 00:17:39.443
we can pretty much get them to
do

264
00:17:39.476 --> 00:17:41.713
whatever it is that we want them
to do.

265
00:17:41.746 --> 00:17:44.548
but. ultimately. they will
decide

266
00:17:44.581 --> 00:17:46.316
the best and most efficient way

267
00:17:46.349 --> 00:17:48.618
of doing what it is
that we want them to do.

268
00:17:48.653 --> 00:17:50.454
So they make their own
decisions?

269
00:17:50.487 --> 00:17:51.656
Yeah. pretty much.

270
00:17:51.689 --> 00:17:55.525
I mean. look it. these robots
have full-blown AI. okay?

271
00:17:55.559 --> 00:17:58.029
So they are way smarter than any
of us.

272
00:17:58.062 --> 00:17:59.797
Without that module connected.

273
00:17:59.831 --> 00:18:01.565
it's not a complete package.
okay?

274
00:18:01.598 --> 00:18:03.968
It's like a person with acute
autism.

275
00:18:04.001 --> 00:18:07.872
Clever as hell but useless
in the real world. okay?

276
00:18:07.905 --> 00:18:10.007
They can walk around aimlessly.

277
00:18:10.041 --> 00:18:11.943
trying to figure out
what the hell they are.

278
00:18:11.976 --> 00:18:13.978
but they're not gonna learn
much in the middle of a jungle.

279
00:18:14.011 --> 00:18:15.713
That's why we've never
let them self-learn.

280
00:18:15.747 --> 00:18:18.049
for obvious reasons. and it's
why

281
00:18:18.082 --> 00:18:19.851
we've kept them off the grid

282
00:18:19.884 --> 00:18:22.352
or connected via satellite. but.
again.

283
00:18:22.385 --> 00:18:23.821
without that module connected.

284
00:18:23.855 --> 00:18:25.489
it's not a complete package.

285
00:18:25.522 --> 00:18:26.323
It's kinda like a...

286
00:18:26.356 --> 00:18:27.357
Zombie terminator.

287
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:29.359
A zombie terminator.

288
00:18:29.392 --> 00:18:30.494
Can we fix it?

289
00:18:30.527 --> 00:18:35.666
Well. with a highly
technical and acutely autistic

290
00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:39.569
delicate adjustment. I'll do my
best.

291
00:18:40.738 --> 00:18:42.572
And

292
00:18:45.843 --> 00:18:46.677
done.

293
00:18:46.711 --> 00:18:48.045
You think this is a fucking
joke?

294
00:18:49.981 --> 00:18:52.482
You do understand that.
if this mission fails.

295
00:18:52.516 --> 00:18:53.483
and you get caught. you could
end up

296
00:18:53.517 --> 00:18:55.485
in a very nasty jail for
the rest of your lives?

297
00:18:55.519 --> 00:18:56.486
Can you chill out?

298
00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.522
All right. I'll put on
my game face for you.

299
00:18:58.555 --> 00:18:59.757
Is that better?

300
00:18:59.791 --> 00:19:01.324
Let's give them a small
navigation test

301
00:19:01.358 --> 00:19:03.627
to see if they're still
calibrated without BR4.

302
00:19:04.896 --> 00:19:07.330
Tell them to rendezvous
at the nav-comm link.

303
00:19:07.364 --> 00:19:08.331
Okay.

304
00:19:24.148 --> 00:19:26.717
Excuse me. do you speak
English?

305
00:19:26.751 --> 00:19:27.985
English?

306
00:19:28.019 --> 00:19:29.020
- No?
- Guys.

307
00:19:33.456 --> 00:19:34.457
Wait.

308
00:19:42.033 --> 00:19:45.036
Hi. do you have a car?

309
00:19:49.941 --> 00:19:50.942
Van broke down.

310
00:19:51.943 --> 00:19:54.611
Needing a boat.

311
00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:57.915
Yeah. can you help us?

312
00:19:57.949 --> 00:19:59.817
We're medical students.

313
00:20:01.085 --> 00:20:02.419
Volunteers?

314
00:20:02.452 --> 00:20:03.087
Oh. immunization.

315
00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.055
We help the sick.

316
00:20:04.088 --> 00:20:04.956
Okay. we have money.

317
00:20:04.989 --> 00:20:06.123
- We can...
- Jordan.

318
00:20:06.157 --> 00:20:07.124
Okay. but. listen. just tell
her

319
00:20:07.158 --> 00:20:09.426
that we're willing to
hire a guide or a car

320
00:20:09.459 --> 00:20:10.594
- to get us out of...
- Maybe you should stick

321
00:20:10.627 --> 00:20:11.428
to English.

322
00:20:11.461 --> 00:20:13.664
Yes. you're American. thank
God.

323
00:20:13.698 --> 00:20:15.166
Listen. man. sorry.

324
00:20:15.199 --> 00:20:16.334
We're so lost. okay?

325
00:20:16.366 --> 00:20:19.704
Our van just got spiked by
this crazy booby-trap thing.

326
00:20:19.737 --> 00:20:21.538
Do you have a car or a truck.
maybe?

327
00:20:21.571 --> 00:20:24.075
We'll pay you if you
can get us to the river.

328
00:20:24.108 --> 00:20:25.109
Ah. shit.

329
00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:27.912
Don't talk. do not say a word.

330
00:20:27.945 --> 00:20:29.579
No sudden movements.

331
00:20:29.613 --> 00:20:31.615
Come inside now. now.

332
00:20:31.648 --> 00:20:33.416
You speak English.

333
00:20:44.494 --> 00:20:46.197
Okay. okay. boys. let's take
it easy.

334
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:47.198
You shut up!

335
00:20:47.231 --> 00:20:48.565
You're not one of us!

336
00:20:50.935 --> 00:20:52.636
Where you guys from?

337
00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:54.138
Why?

338
00:20:54.171 --> 00:20:55.572
Hey!

339
00:20:58.042 --> 00:20:59.176
We came from that direction.

340
00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:00.778
About five hours walk.

341
00:21:00.811 --> 00:21:02.013
Angie. Angie. show him.

342
00:21:06.516 --> 00:21:07.517
You leave now!

343
00:21:11.656 --> 00:21:12.589
Shut up!

344
00:21:12.622 --> 00:21:13.623
You're all gone

345
00:21:15.927 --> 00:21:16.928
or I'll kill you!

346
00:21:25.736 --> 00:21:26.804
Are you okay?

347
00:21:39.616 --> 00:21:41.618
Navigation is completed.

348
00:21:41.652 --> 00:21:44.055
Collate the data. send it
back stateside for review.

349
00:21:44.088 --> 00:21:45.723
Shh.

350
00:21:45.756 --> 00:21:47.024
- Major.
- Load the objective.

351
00:21:47.058 --> 00:21:49.961
and don't let that fat
fuck get under your skin.

352
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:55.066
New objective. load it.

353
00:21:55.099 --> 00:21:55.900
Whoa. whoa. whoa. cowboy.

354
00:21:55.933 --> 00:21:56.834
I write the code objectives
here.

355
00:21:56.867 --> 00:21:59.070
This isn't mine. where did this
come from?

356
00:21:59.103 --> 00:22:00.537
Your boss. so load it.

357
00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:02.707
Hey. hey. hey. hey. hold the
fuck on!

358
00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.574
All right. I wanna read it
first.

359
00:22:04.607 --> 00:22:05.710
I'm the lead code writer here.

360
00:22:05.743 --> 00:22:07.778
There could be bugs in it
that could drop them all.

361
00:22:07.812 --> 00:22:09.512
I just wanna check it out first.

362
00:22:10.915 --> 00:22:11.916
30 seconds.

363
00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:14.051
It's not my code.

364
00:22:14.085 --> 00:22:15.820
You're not listening. dude.

365
00:22:15.853 --> 00:22:18.689
All right. it could take weeks
to write code objectives.

366
00:22:20.658 --> 00:22:22.860
Major. the techs wanna check
the code.

367
00:22:24.795 --> 00:22:26.529
Foster. is the code solid?

368
00:22:28.032 --> 00:22:28.733
Let Kroger check it.

369
00:22:28.766 --> 00:22:30.633
Should take him about 15
minutes.

370
00:22:31.369 --> 00:22:32.903
Fielding. please route me
through

371
00:22:32.937 --> 00:22:35.973
- the sandbox emulator. please.
- Got it.

372
00:22:36.007 --> 00:22:37.008
That a boy.

373
00:22:39.276 --> 00:22:40.811
Hey. Four's coming online.

374
00:22:42.346 --> 00:22:43.646
Damage report?

375
00:22:43.681 --> 00:22:44.949
Looks okay. just the comm
module

376
00:22:44.982 --> 00:22:46.951
isn't responding properly.

377
00:22:46.984 --> 00:22:48.686
Okay. so there's eight code
breaks

378
00:22:48.719 --> 00:22:50.021
in this objective.

379
00:22:50.755 --> 00:22:52.555
Probably won't when I start
digging.

380
00:22:52.589 --> 00:22:53.891
How long?

381
00:22:53.924 --> 00:22:55.292
10. 12 hours.

382
00:22:55.326 --> 00:22:56.894
Faster.

383
00:22:56.927 --> 00:22:58.729
I need to crash a minute. man.

384
00:22:58.763 --> 00:23:00.597
I'm still lagging after that
flight.

385
00:23:02.767 --> 00:23:05.136
You fix it now. you sleep
later.

386
00:23:05.169 --> 00:23:06.569
You copy that?

387
00:23:14.745 --> 00:23:18.816
Thank you so much for
letting us into your home.

388
00:23:18.849 --> 00:23:20.650
We promise to be out of your
hair

389
00:23:20.684 --> 00:23:22.253
first thing in the morning.

390
00:23:22.286 --> 00:23:25.222
It's okay. I have some food to
share.

391
00:23:25.256 --> 00:23:26.257
Oh.

392
00:23:44.775 --> 00:23:46.744
Wanna see something cool?

393
00:23:46.777 --> 00:23:49.646
So what special forces were
you with?

394
00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.681
The tattoo.

395
00:23:53.217 --> 00:23:54.752
This guy's a Navy SEAL.

396
00:23:57.054 --> 00:23:58.355
Maybe the tattoo's fake.

397
00:24:00.391 --> 00:24:02.093
I think this guy's full of shit.

398
00:24:03.694 --> 00:24:05.628
Maybe if you would've
kept your mouth shut.

399
00:24:05.663 --> 00:24:08.332
like I told you. that
would've gone just fine.

400
00:24:08.365 --> 00:24:11.368
Yeah. well. I think a real
Navy SEAL.

401
00:24:11.402 --> 00:24:14.271
a real SEAl. could've
handled that situation.

402
00:24:14.305 --> 00:24:15.372
- Okay.
- Stop!

403
00:24:16.941 --> 00:24:18.242
I've had enough for one day.

404
00:24:19.376 --> 00:24:20.945
We all have.

405
00:24:24.448 --> 00:24:26.283
Sit down.

406
00:24:26.317 --> 00:24:27.151
Sorry.

407
00:24:27.184 --> 00:24:28.185
Come on. dude.

408
00:24:30.387 --> 00:24:31.822
Sorry.

409
00:24:40.998 --> 00:24:42.066
Objective's solid.

410
00:24:44.902 --> 00:24:47.404
More importantly. where
are my energy sticks?

411
00:24:49.106 --> 00:24:50.207
Are we live?

412
00:25:02.386 --> 00:25:03.687
What is this?

413
00:25:03.721 --> 00:25:05.356
New testing parameters.

414
00:25:05.389 --> 00:25:08.058
Definitely didn't
look like a simulation.

415
00:25:08.092 --> 00:25:10.728
There's some questionable code
in there.

416
00:25:14.865 --> 00:25:15.866
Whoa!

417
00:25:16.834 --> 00:25:18.736
Team will recon first.

418
00:25:18.769 --> 00:25:20.037
The orders to secure and take
over

419
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:21.672
the site will come from above.

420
00:25:26.143 --> 00:25:31.015
Leap. Leap.

421
00:25:38.756 --> 00:25:40.424
You're up early.

422
00:25:40.457 --> 00:25:41.926
How'd you sleep?

423
00:25:41.959 --> 00:25:42.893
I didn't sleep at all.

424
00:25:42.927 --> 00:25:44.428
You guys ready?

425
00:25:44.461 --> 00:25:45.863
Grab your gear. let's go.

426
00:25:47.031 --> 00:25:48.232
Where's Leap. is he gone?

427
00:25:48.999 --> 00:25:51.135
He should be back soon. I
hope.

428
00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:55.239
All right. guys. we stay.

429
00:25:55.272 --> 00:25:57.274
Leap knows these trails
better than anybody. okay?

430
00:25:57.308 --> 00:25:58.909
It'll save us from
getting a leg blown off.

431
00:25:58.943 --> 00:26:00.377
You're kidding. right?

432
00:26:00.411 --> 00:26:03.113
I'm actually surprised you
guys made it in here alive.

433
00:26:11.121 --> 00:26:13.924
Bang. bang.
bang. bang. bang. bang!

434
00:26:13.958 --> 00:26:15.893
Bang. bang. bang. bang!

435
00:28:47.544 --> 00:28:49.012
You leave now!

436
00:28:52.349 --> 00:28:53.617
We're supposed to meet a boat
here

437
00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:55.018
to take us down the Song-Ma.

438
00:28:55.052 --> 00:28:56.019
Think you can get us there?

439
00:28:56.053 --> 00:28:58.589
No. I'm gonna take you
guys back to your van.

440
00:28:58.622 --> 00:29:00.457
Why. landmines?

441
00:29:00.491 --> 00:29:02.559
Well. the boys outside.
they have plantations

442
00:29:02.593 --> 00:29:03.560
in between here and your boat.

443
00:29:03.594 --> 00:29:05.429
You leave now or you die here!

444
00:29:07.097 --> 00:29:08.966
We need Leap to help
guide us outta here.

445
00:29:08.999 --> 00:29:11.034
He knows this area better than
me.

446
00:29:11.068 --> 00:29:12.236
Leap!

447
00:29:12.269 --> 00:29:13.337
What about an airport?

448
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:15.939
I saw a plane dropping gear
or something yesterday.

449
00:29:45.135 --> 00:29:46.637
You leave now!

450
00:29:46.671 --> 00:29:48.505
The boy will take you to the
track.

451
00:29:52.943 --> 00:29:55.145
The bots have scanned 12
males. armed.

452
00:29:55.179 --> 00:29:57.682
five unarmed males. 14 unarmed
females.

453
00:29:57.715 --> 00:29:59.650
eight children. all locals.

454
00:29:59.684 --> 00:30:00.517
Activate the team.

455
00:30:00.551 --> 00:30:02.352
I think we need to reconsider
this.

456
00:30:05.723 --> 00:30:07.458
We can't do this.

457
00:30:10.461 --> 00:30:11.462
Seriously. dude?

458
00:30:44.361 --> 00:30:45.329
We gotta get outta here.

459
00:30:45.362 --> 00:30:46.196
Where?

460
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:47.030
Yeah. where?

461
00:30:47.064 --> 00:30:48.332
They're shooting all around
us!

462
00:30:48.365 --> 00:30:49.366
We go outside. we're dead.

463
00:30:49.399 --> 00:30:50.501
Shh.

464
00:30:56.741 --> 00:30:57.742
How many?

465
00:30:57.775 --> 00:30:59.376
Three.

466
00:30:59.409 --> 00:31:01.178
Who are they?

467
00:31:01.211 --> 00:31:02.412
I don't know.

468
00:31:17.628 --> 00:31:19.096
What are they?

469
00:31:20.497 --> 00:31:21.498
Shit.

470
00:31:35.245 --> 00:31:36.446
Who are they?

471
00:31:37.548 --> 00:31:38.750
I don't know.

472
00:31:47.692 --> 00:31:50.160
Hey. hey. hey. hey.
Fielding. never touch.

473
00:31:51.663 --> 00:31:53.196
No. come back inside!

474
00:31:57.035 --> 00:31:58.002
- What are you doing?
- That's not a heroin runner.

475
00:31:58.036 --> 00:32:00.203
that's a grieving wife
and probably a mother.

476
00:32:00.237 --> 00:32:01.005
She's a witness!

477
00:32:01.039 --> 00:32:01.873
Protecting her home and
family!

478
00:32:01.906 --> 00:32:03.340
You choosing not to follow
orders?

479
00:32:03.373 --> 00:32:07.578
Fuck this. Boller!

480
00:32:07.611 --> 00:32:09.146
Get back online.

481
00:32:14.518 --> 00:32:15.519
It's done.

482
00:32:23.193 --> 00:32:25.797
Do you have a problem
following orders. Fielding?

483
00:32:26.798 --> 00:32:27.799
No.

484
00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.669
Just wasn't ready for this.

485
00:32:48.753 --> 00:32:53.658
Okay. got to get inside.

486
00:33:20.217 --> 00:33:21.819
Let's get you guys the hell
outta here.

487
00:33:42.674 --> 00:33:43.741
You okay?

488
00:33:43.775 --> 00:33:44.709
Okay?

489
00:33:56.386 --> 00:33:57.587
Gotta help her.

490
00:33:58.656 --> 00:34:00.725
Yeah. I'll go. I'll go.

491
00:34:02.727 --> 00:34:04.762
Hey. what are you doing?

492
00:34:04.796 --> 00:34:06.463
If you go out there. you're
dead.

493
00:34:06.496 --> 00:34:07.999
Please. don't go.

494
00:34:08.032 --> 00:34:09.633
Be quiet. be quiet.

495
00:34:26.984 --> 00:34:28.653
Oh. shit!

496
00:34:28.686 --> 00:34:31.254
Stay low. stay low. follow me!

497
00:34:31.288 --> 00:34:32.156
Come on!

498
00:34:56.346 --> 00:34:57.715
Dez. get up. get up.
get up!

499
00:35:10.862 --> 00:35:12.063
What do we do?

500
00:35:12.096 --> 00:35:13.296
Stay here.

501
00:35:14.899 --> 00:35:15.867
Where's he going?

502
00:35:30.081 --> 00:35:31.716
Hey!

503
00:35:31.749 --> 00:35:32.750
Over here!

504
00:35:35.019 --> 00:35:36.620
Who the hell is that?

505
00:35:36.654 --> 00:35:37.955
- Abort.
- Stop the team.

506
00:35:40.024 --> 00:35:40.858
We're recording this?

507
00:35:40.892 --> 00:35:41.926
- Yes.
- Rewind.

508
00:35:43.895 --> 00:35:44.929
There!

509
00:35:44.962 --> 00:35:45.963
Zoom up.

510
00:35:46.864 --> 00:35:48.331
Major. are you seeing this?

511
00:35:48.365 --> 00:35:49.566
Hold tight. hold tight.

512
00:35:51.568 --> 00:35:53.570
Who the fuck is this guy?

513
00:36:04.048 --> 00:36:05.415
Fuck!

514
00:36:19.596 --> 00:36:20.597
Hey.

515
00:36:21.598 --> 00:36:22.599
Hey!

516
00:36:34.912 --> 00:36:35.980
It's Mason.

517
00:36:37.849 --> 00:36:38.883
He wants us to run to
him.

518
00:36:38.916 --> 00:36:40.417
Come on. no. stay here.

519
00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:41.518
Stay low. stay low.

520
00:36:42.153 --> 00:36:43.353
Stay. stay.

521
00:36:46.791 --> 00:36:47.758
There's more of them.

522
00:36:47.792 --> 00:36:49.459
Major. we have six more.

523
00:37:00.137 --> 00:37:01.772
You said it was a clean site.

524
00:37:03.107 --> 00:37:04.775
Obviously not.

525
00:37:04.809 --> 00:37:06.643
These people have seen
everything.

526
00:37:07.577 --> 00:37:09.146
Boller. take them all down.

527
00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:10.513
No witnesses.

528
00:37:10.547 --> 00:37:11.615
Confirmed.

529
00:37:11.648 --> 00:37:13.516
Turn the team back on. no
witnesses.

530
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:14.218
These aren't drug runners!

531
00:37:14.252 --> 00:37:16.519
Those are tourists or something!

532
00:37:16.553 --> 00:37:18.923
Or dug traffickers.
I said turn it back on!

533
00:37:21.158 --> 00:37:22.559
It's either us or them.

534
00:37:23.227 --> 00:37:24.461
I vote us.

535
00:37:27.597 --> 00:37:29.432
Keala. come on. Keala!

536
00:37:31.669 --> 00:37:34.071
Get that guy. turn them
around. eliminate the witnesses!

537
00:37:34.105 --> 00:37:35.273
Can't!

538
00:37:35.306 --> 00:37:36.307
The team's priority is to
eliminate the highest threat.

539
00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:38.441
And that dude shooting
is the highest threat.

540
00:37:38.475 --> 00:37:39.710
Can we change the objectives?

541
00:37:39.744 --> 00:37:41.846
No. we only have face scans
of the big guy. no one else's.

542
00:37:41.879 --> 00:37:42.646
And?

543
00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.015
We need face scans of
everyone!

544
00:37:44.048 --> 00:37:46.549
Otherwise. we code to allow them

545
00:37:46.583 --> 00:37:48.185
to shoot anything and anyone.

546
00:37:48.219 --> 00:37:49.053
We do that.

547
00:37:49.086 --> 00:37:49.921
We can't do this!

548
00:37:49.954 --> 00:37:51.689
- She's right...
- Do it!

549
00:38:33.563 --> 00:38:34.799
Fuck!

550
00:38:34.832 --> 00:38:35.632
Mason.

551
00:38:35.666 --> 00:38:36.499
Fuck!

552
00:38:36.533 --> 00:38:37.368
Mason.

553
00:38:37.401 --> 00:38:39.270
Fuck. I couldn't fucking save
them!

554
00:38:39.303 --> 00:38:40.171
Fuck!

555
00:38:40.204 --> 00:38:41.571
Goddamn it. come on.

556
00:38:41.604 --> 00:38:43.240
This guy isn't a tourist.
Major.

557
00:38:43.274 --> 00:38:44.809
Do we have an ID on him yet?

558
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:47.011
Sending you a packet.

559
00:38:48.779 --> 00:38:49.780
A SEAL.

560
00:38:50.314 --> 00:38:52.083
Is he a deserter or one of us?

561
00:38:52.116 --> 00:38:53.117
I'll make a call.

562
00:38:58.856 --> 00:38:59.991
Special forces. huh?

563
00:39:00.858 --> 00:39:01.926
If this guy is a deserter.

564
00:39:01.959 --> 00:39:03.995
it could be the ultimate field
test.

565
00:39:04.028 --> 00:39:05.896
Yeah. I was thinking the same
thing.

566
00:39:10.101 --> 00:39:12.269
Mason is priority number one.

567
00:39:12.303 --> 00:39:14.705
Terminate all witnesses.

568
00:39:14.739 --> 00:39:16.874
Mason is top priority target
number one.

569
00:39:18.142 --> 00:39:20.011
And terminate the group that's
with him.

570
00:39:20.044 --> 00:39:21.045
Make it happen.

571
00:39:24.982 --> 00:39:25.983
30 seconds.

572
00:39:35.993 --> 00:39:36.994
Fuck!

573
00:39:40.664 --> 00:39:41.531
Come on.

574
00:39:55.012 --> 00:39:55.846
Where are the others?

575
00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:56.881
We're here.

576
00:40:01.052 --> 00:40:02.319
We lost Bao and the girls.

577
00:40:02.353 --> 00:40:03.187
Have you seen them?

578
00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:04.055
No.

579
00:40:04.088 --> 00:40:05.189
Did you see my son?

580
00:40:05.222 --> 00:40:06.190
He went too fast.

581
00:40:06.223 --> 00:40:08.893
He took off into the trees.

582
00:40:08.926 --> 00:40:13.330
Hey. Keala. Keala. Leap
is fine. I promise. okay?

583
00:40:13.364 --> 00:40:14.732
He's fine.

584
00:40:14.765 --> 00:40:15.433
We'll find him. okay?

585
00:40:15.466 --> 00:40:17.168
You need to lead us outta here.

586
00:40:17.201 --> 00:40:18.202
You know the way. okay?

587
00:40:18.235 --> 00:40:20.104
Let's go. we gotta go now.

588
00:40:20.137 --> 00:40:21.205
Let's go. I'll stay behind

589
00:40:21.238 --> 00:40:22.973
and keep an eye out. okay?

590
00:40:23.007 --> 00:40:23.974
Go. go. go.

591
00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:28.999
Someone's gonna live
to tell what happened.

592
00:42:29.033 --> 00:42:30.434
And what'd they see?

593
00:42:30.467 --> 00:42:32.169
Four men wearing armor?

594
00:42:32.203 --> 00:42:35.172
We were here for surveillance
field testing. not killing!

595
00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:40.144
You highly paid geniuses are
building

596
00:42:40.177 --> 00:42:43.214
weapons of war. no?

597
00:42:44.782 --> 00:42:46.250
And yet when those
weapons are actually used.

598
00:42:46.283 --> 00:42:48.819
you throw your fucking
hands up all righteous.

599
00:42:48.852 --> 00:42:51.255
like you have no idea what's
going on.

600
00:42:51.288 --> 00:42:52.289
But you do.

601
00:42:53.057 --> 00:42:54.391
You knew exactly what you were
building

602
00:42:54.425 --> 00:42:55.993
the second you took this job.

603
00:42:56.961 --> 00:42:59.430
So. before you fucking judge me.

604
00:42:59.463 --> 00:43:03.400
remember. everyone
involved with these things.

605
00:43:03.434 --> 00:43:04.335
everyone all the way down to the
guy

606
00:43:04.368 --> 00:43:07.871
who drops off the donuts. is
accountable.

607
00:43:12.276 --> 00:43:16.981
And you three are at the top of
that line.

608
00:43:21.919 --> 00:43:22.886
Yes. Major?

609
00:43:26.290 --> 00:43:27.091
Oh. shit!

610
00:43:27.124 --> 00:43:28.859
BR2 just shot one.

611
00:43:28.892 --> 00:43:30.227
- Oh my God.
- No.

612
00:43:32.029 --> 00:43:33.163
Shit. shit. shit.

613
00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:40.971
Oh. fuck.

614
00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:51.215
She's still alive.

615
00:43:55.919 --> 00:43:56.954
Hurry it up.

616
00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:04.361
Stop. please.

617
00:44:05.462 --> 00:44:07.298
What the fuck's it doing?

618
00:44:08.866 --> 00:44:09.600
Please. please.

619
00:44:09.633 --> 00:44:11.135
Please. please.

620
00:44:19.043 --> 00:44:22.446
Here she is. she's a doctor.

621
00:44:22.479 --> 00:44:23.280
They're all doctors.

622
00:44:23.314 --> 00:44:26.016
They're here on a good cause
mission.

623
00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:27.017
She's not a drug runner.

624
00:44:27.051 --> 00:44:28.152
she's a.

625
00:44:32.389 --> 00:44:33.590
Fuck.

626
00:44:33.624 --> 00:44:36.860
Oh my God!

627
00:44:36.894 --> 00:44:37.861
Ah. shit.

628
00:44:38.929 --> 00:44:40.264
Calm down. calm down.

629
00:44:40.297 --> 00:44:43.233
If this mission goes fucking
south. we're all dead.

630
00:44:43.267 --> 00:44:44.535
- Seriously?
- We're all dead.

631
00:44:44.568 --> 00:44:45.436
Come on. man. okay?

632
00:44:45.469 --> 00:44:48.105
You're scaring her. you're
scaring me.

633
00:44:48.138 --> 00:44:49.406
I'm scared.

634
00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:51.542
Hey. hey. we are the
brains trust behind this.

635
00:44:51.575 --> 00:44:52.609
They need us.

636
00:44:53.977 --> 00:44:56.213
Everyone's expendable. big
boy.

637
00:44:56.246 --> 00:44:58.148
even you three geniuses.

638
00:45:15.366 --> 00:45:16.367
Hey.

639
00:45:28.379 --> 00:45:30.914
Wendy and Angie and Bao are
still out there somewhere.

640
00:45:32.583 --> 00:45:33.484
We gotta find them.

641
00:45:33.517 --> 00:45:34.651
No. man. they're dead.

642
00:45:34.686 --> 00:45:36.053
Don't say that!

643
00:45:36.086 --> 00:45:37.221
We haven't heard gunshots in a
while.

644
00:45:37.254 --> 00:45:39.189
Maybe they're just right behind
us.

645
00:45:39.223 --> 00:45:41.392
- Angie. Wendy!
- Hey. shh!

646
00:45:41.425 --> 00:45:43.127
Shh. hey!

647
00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:46.063
We can make it out of here.
okay. if you keep quiet.

648
00:45:46.997 --> 00:45:50.067
The greater distance we put
between us and these things.

649
00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:52.202
the better chances we have.

650
00:45:52.236 --> 00:45:53.237
Mason. your hand.

651
00:45:56.006 --> 00:45:57.174
We gotta fix this.

652
00:46:07.084 --> 00:46:08.552
BR2's got a lock on something.

653
00:46:39.049 --> 00:46:40.117
That's Bao!

654
00:46:41.452 --> 00:46:43.387
Hey. hey. hold on!

655
00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:45.622
You go out there. we're all
dead.

656
00:46:45.657 --> 00:46:47.357
I gotta go. let me go.

657
00:46:47.391 --> 00:46:48.459
Stop.

658
00:48:25.222 --> 00:48:25.857
It's Four.

659
00:48:25.890 --> 00:48:26.791
Is he connected?

660
00:48:26.824 --> 00:48:28.158
Bluetooth auto-login.

661
00:48:28.191 --> 00:48:29.359
How's he doing that?

662
00:48:29.393 --> 00:48:31.528
Welcome to the future.
man. it's automatic.

663
00:48:31.562 --> 00:48:33.564
These things can connect
to almost anything.

664
00:48:33.597 --> 00:48:34.666
Four's comm module isn't
pinging us.

665
00:48:34.699 --> 00:48:39.136
It's either screwed or
fallen out during the crash.

666
00:48:41.873 --> 00:48:43.140
What the hell?

667
00:48:43.875 --> 00:48:45.342
Stopping all the commands.

668
00:48:45.375 --> 00:48:46.778
Here. I'll send it a bug.

669
00:48:48.378 --> 00:48:50.581
This will knock it on its ass.

670
00:48:50.614 --> 00:48:52.316
What the?

671
00:48:52.349 --> 00:48:53.584
Do you think it's talking to us?

672
00:48:53.617 --> 00:48:55.452
Is the link being hacked?

673
00:48:55.485 --> 00:48:56.620
No.

674
00:48:56.654 --> 00:48:58.790
What if the cap on the AI
was fried during the fall?

675
00:48:58.823 --> 00:48:59.824
And?

676
00:49:01.625 --> 00:49:03.360
Run Four's system's files.

677
00:49:07.197 --> 00:49:08.265
- Oh. shit.
- Someone needs to start

678
00:49:08.298 --> 00:49:09.667
talking to me.

679
00:49:09.701 --> 00:49:10.802
He's downloading our files.

680
00:49:10.835 --> 00:49:11.769
Well. stop it!

681
00:49:11.803 --> 00:49:12.636
Denied!

682
00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:13.671
It's trying to figure out what
it is.

683
00:49:13.705 --> 00:49:15.272
Is this a problem?

684
00:49:15.305 --> 00:49:16.506
It should already have this
detail.

685
00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:18.843
I think it's just trying to
reboot itself.

686
00:49:18.876 --> 00:49:19.844
Download complete.

687
00:49:19.877 --> 00:49:22.747
Terminate BR4 before
we lose the advantage.

688
00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:23.781
- Now.
- Yes. sir.

689
00:49:23.815 --> 00:49:24.882
We're working on it right now.

690
00:49:24.916 --> 00:49:26.516
The data that I'm getting
from it makes no sense.

691
00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:28.518
Who can send that
self-destruct code?

692
00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:34.224
He stopped it.

693
00:49:34.257 --> 00:49:34.892
How?

694
00:49:34.926 --> 00:49:36.226
He's becoming self-aware.

695
00:49:36.259 --> 00:49:37.095
That's not good.

696
00:49:37.127 --> 00:49:38.096
What's with the 30 second
countdown?

697
00:49:38.128 --> 00:49:40.497
It's a fusion device.
a three chemical mix.

698
00:49:40.530 --> 00:49:42.165
It takes 20 to 30 seconds to
combine

699
00:49:42.199 --> 00:49:43.200
before it can detonate.

700
00:49:43.233 --> 00:49:44.468
Burns at 100.000 degrees.

701
00:49:44.501 --> 00:49:45.937
and a blast radius of over 200
yards.

702
00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:46.771
I'm not sure blowing it up

703
00:49:46.804 --> 00:49:48.171
where it's locate dis a good
idea.

704
00:49:48.205 --> 00:49:49.841
Look what it's standing next to.

705
00:49:49.874 --> 00:49:50.708
The link.

706
00:49:50.742 --> 00:49:51.843
You blow Four. you lose the
others.

707
00:49:51.876 --> 00:49:53.543
Shit!

708
00:49:53.577 --> 00:49:55.512
Okay. is Four dangerous?

709
00:49:55.545 --> 00:49:58.315
No. not in its current state.

710
00:49:58.348 --> 00:49:59.182
Oh my God.

711
00:49:59.216 --> 00:50:00.584
- What now?
- Okay.

712
00:50:00.617 --> 00:50:01.853
It's loading itself to our
servers.

713
00:50:01.886 --> 00:50:02.887
Now it's dangerous.

714
00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:03.721
Cutting the connection.

715
00:50:03.755 --> 00:50:04.922
I want that link terminated
now!

716
00:50:04.956 --> 00:50:05.857
We'll lose the others.

717
00:50:05.890 --> 00:50:06.958
He's loading fast.

718
00:50:06.991 --> 00:50:08.425
I said terminate!

719
00:50:08.458 --> 00:50:09.459
Fuck it.

720
00:50:10.394 --> 00:50:11.729
Just hit. what the?

721
00:50:19.236 --> 00:50:21.338
Nice work. cowboy.

722
00:50:21.371 --> 00:50:22.707
How much of it loaded up?

723
00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:25.409
About 90% before you got all
excited.

724
00:50:25.442 --> 00:50:27.845
How long before you get
it back up and running?

725
00:50:27.879 --> 00:50:29.747
Depends on how much damage you
did.

726
00:50:31.683 --> 00:50:32.684
Fix it.

727
00:50:35.552 --> 00:50:37.655
Fuck. shit!

728
00:50:37.689 --> 00:50:38.690
Fuck!

729
00:50:57.675 --> 00:50:59.911
I got Foster on the
line. put us on speaker.

730
00:51:03.848 --> 00:51:06.616
We cannot let BR4 find a
way to connect. gentlemen.

731
00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:08.485
Now. where did it upload its
data to?

732
00:51:08.518 --> 00:51:09.687
All the cables were just
pulled out.

733
00:51:09.721 --> 00:51:11.354
We have no idea just yet.

734
00:51:11.388 --> 00:51:12.857
Make it a priority. find out.

735
00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:15.492
He's learning really fast.
sir.

736
00:51:15.525 --> 00:51:18.428
I think his AI is uncapped.

737
00:51:23.533 --> 00:51:25.002
Keep an eye on it.

738
00:51:25.036 --> 00:51:27.004
We can monitor Four
through the BFA feeds

739
00:51:27.038 --> 00:51:28.906
if the others are close enough.

740
00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:31.408
Okay. so how are you gonna
bring it under control?

741
00:51:31.441 --> 00:51:32.844
We have to take it down
somehow.

742
00:51:32.877 --> 00:51:34.812
It shut down its self-destruct
sequence.

743
00:51:34.846 --> 00:51:35.880
What about the other BR units?

744
00:51:35.913 --> 00:51:37.514
Can any of them shut down BR4?

745
00:51:38.448 --> 00:51:40.283
The others can take him out.

746
00:51:40.317 --> 00:51:41.651
I can write a new objective.

747
00:51:42.652 --> 00:51:43.688
BR1 can still hunt the others

748
00:51:43.721 --> 00:51:46.791
while Two and Three are
tasked with capturing BR4.

749
00:51:47.959 --> 00:51:49.060
Do it.

750
00:51:49.093 --> 00:51:50.260
On it.

751
00:53:40.137 --> 00:53:41.504
It was a mine.

752
00:53:41.538 --> 00:53:43.674
- What if that was Angie?
- Or Mason?

753
00:54:02.559 --> 00:54:04.161
- Oh. fuck!
- Let's go.

754
00:54:04.195 --> 00:54:05.763
Let's go now. hurry.
come on. let's go. now.

755
00:54:05.796 --> 00:54:07.564
Come on. Keala. come on.

756
00:54:07.597 --> 00:54:08.632
Let's go. hurry. hurry.

757
00:54:08.666 --> 00:54:10.433
Everybody follow Keala. okay?

758
00:54:10.467 --> 00:54:11.468
Let's go.

759
00:54:24.181 --> 00:54:25.448
What is that smell?

760
00:54:26.684 --> 00:54:28.152
It's ammonia.

761
00:54:28.185 --> 00:54:30.688
They mix it with the opium
as they boil it down.

762
00:54:37.527 --> 00:54:38.495
Get down. get down!

763
00:54:41.564 --> 00:54:43.000
Leap. Leap!

764
00:54:43.034 --> 00:54:44.201
Wendy. Wendy!

765
00:54:44.235 --> 00:54:46.971
- Wendy!
- Oh. God!

766
00:54:47.004 --> 00:54:48.806
Leap. Leap!

767
00:54:50.107 --> 00:54:53.510
I thought you were all dead.

768
00:55:02.153 --> 00:55:03.921
Where's Angie?

769
00:55:03.955 --> 00:55:05.890
We haven't seen her.

770
00:55:05.923 --> 00:55:06.924
And Bao?

771
00:55:12.129 --> 00:55:14.065
Run!

772
00:55:41.926 --> 00:55:43.060
Dez!

773
00:55:59.143 --> 00:56:00.543
Can you hear me?

774
00:56:12.289 --> 00:56:13.891
The kid has the module!

775
00:56:13.924 --> 00:56:15.026
I'm guessing that's Number
Four's.

776
00:56:15.059 --> 00:56:16.060
Shit!

777
00:56:23.768 --> 00:56:24.769
No!

778
00:56:30.975 --> 00:56:31.809
Come on!

779
00:56:31.842 --> 00:56:34.011
Yeah. you're welcome!

780
00:56:34.045 --> 00:56:35.346
Come on!

781
00:57:42.847 --> 00:57:44.215
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

782
00:57:44.248 --> 00:57:45.983
Start priming the
self-destruct.

783
00:57:47.685 --> 00:57:49.220
Blow it. blow it. come on!

784
00:57:49.253 --> 00:57:50.754
- 30 seconds.
- Fuck!

785
00:57:50.788 --> 00:57:51.889
Seriously?

786
00:58:12.376 --> 00:58:13.210
And?

787
00:58:13.244 --> 00:58:14.011
Detonation confirmed.

788
00:58:14.044 --> 00:58:15.112
How do we know we got
everyone?

789
00:58:15.146 --> 00:58:17.448
It should've wiped out
everything within 200 yards.

790
00:58:17.481 --> 00:58:20.451
Until I see bodies. no one is
dead.

791
00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:10.134
Leap.

792
00:59:11.402 --> 00:59:12.403
Leap.

793
00:59:19.410 --> 00:59:20.811
Keala. Keala.

794
00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:25.482
Hey. hey. let me see.
let me see. let me see.

795
00:59:30.487 --> 00:59:31.488
Help!

796
00:59:32.323 --> 00:59:34.058
Keala needs help!

797
00:59:34.091 --> 00:59:35.960
I got it. got it. got it.

798
00:59:35.993 --> 00:59:37.528
Hey. hey. stay with me.

799
00:59:45.369 --> 00:59:47.071
What happened?

800
00:59:47.104 --> 00:59:49.473
Move your hand. move your hand.

801
00:59:49.506 --> 00:59:50.507
Oh my God.

802
00:59:51.542 --> 00:59:53.143
Oh. shit.

803
00:59:53.177 --> 00:59:54.378
We need to move her on her
side.

804
00:59:54.411 --> 00:59:56.146
Come on. Mason. help me.

805
00:59:56.180 --> 00:59:57.481
Move her on her side.

806
00:59:59.016 --> 01:00:00.351
Need to position her here.

807
01:00:00.384 --> 01:00:01.952
Okay. put pressure on the back.

808
01:00:01.986 --> 01:00:04.021
Okay. come on. put your hand
here. okay.

809
01:00:04.054 --> 01:00:05.556
The bullet's gone through.

810
01:00:05.589 --> 01:00:09.026
We don't have a lot of
equipment for a wound like this.

811
01:00:09.059 --> 01:00:11.428
We're gonna try and stop
the bleeding. but. uh.

812
01:00:12.429 --> 01:00:13.430
But what?

813
01:00:15.065 --> 01:00:16.233
It's not looking good.

814
01:00:20.371 --> 01:00:22.806
Keala. we're gonna try to
get you outta here. okay?

815
01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:24.441
Put your hand here.

816
01:00:25.609 --> 01:00:27.011
Dez. Dez.

817
01:00:27.044 --> 01:00:28.045
Can you hear me?

818
01:00:28.846 --> 01:00:30.147
Dez!

819
01:00:37.955 --> 01:00:39.089
Leap!

820
01:00:47.998 --> 01:00:49.466
Your father was a brave man.

821
01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:08.485
I respect any man

822
01:01:08.519 --> 01:01:09.920
who would die protecting his
family.

823
01:01:09.953 --> 01:01:12.056
He was fighting for
you and your mom. okay?

824
01:01:14.291 --> 01:01:15.326
It's my fault.

825
01:01:15.359 --> 01:01:19.063
I made the metal man angry.

826
01:01:19.096 --> 01:01:20.230
I stole this.

827
01:01:26.036 --> 01:01:28.105
Leap. Leap. look at me.

828
01:01:28.906 --> 01:01:31.175
This is not because of you.
okay?

829
01:01:31.208 --> 01:01:34.978
Some men sent these metal men
here to attack our village.

830
01:01:35.012 --> 01:01:35.979
It's not because of anything

831
01:01:36.013 --> 01:01:37.648
that you did or because of this.

832
01:01:46.924 --> 01:01:48.892
Let's go on one. two. three.

833
01:02:00.371 --> 01:02:02.239
Keala. can you walk?

834
01:02:03.708 --> 01:02:05.342
Yes. slowly.

835
01:02:05.376 --> 01:02:06.510
- I can help her.
- Leap. Leap.

836
01:02:06.543 --> 01:02:09.980
Leap.

837
01:02:22.059 --> 01:02:23.293
Leap!

838
01:02:30.267 --> 01:02:31.235
Leap!

839
01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:43.981
Leap.

840
01:02:44.615 --> 01:02:45.683
Leap. listen.

841
01:02:46.684 --> 01:02:49.386
We gotta get your mother
outta here now. okay?

842
01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:52.724
We need you. you're the
only one who knows the way.

843
01:02:52.757 --> 01:02:54.391
I need your help. okay?

844
01:03:08.505 --> 01:03:09.573
Leap. Leap.

845
01:03:35.098 --> 01:03:36.300
Go.

846
01:03:36.333 --> 01:03:37.201
Major. this has gone south.

847
01:03:37.234 --> 01:03:38.670
We have to start making some
decisions.

848
01:03:38.703 --> 01:03:40.337
We have a robot wondering the
jungle

849
01:03:40.370 --> 01:03:42.606
looking for the fucking
Internet.

850
01:03:42.639 --> 01:03:43.974
Just stay calm.

851
01:03:45.542 --> 01:03:47.712
American citizens.
who can still be alive.

852
01:03:47.745 --> 01:03:51.181
who quite possibly have both
physical and video evidence.

853
01:03:51.215 --> 01:03:52.416
I don't have enough assets in
the field

854
01:03:52.449 --> 01:03:54.084
to solve both problems.

855
01:03:55.352 --> 01:03:57.421
I recommend you call in drone
support.

856
01:03:57.454 --> 01:03:59.657
we wipe this area clean.

857
01:03:59.691 --> 01:04:02.159
Listen. this op is off the
grid.

858
01:04:02.192 --> 01:04:04.194
If I start making calls for
drone support.

859
01:04:04.228 --> 01:04:06.396
we're gonna have a lot
bigger problems to deal with.

860
01:04:06.430 --> 01:04:08.031
We have their
positions.

861
01:04:08.065 --> 01:04:09.801
I'll call you right back.

862
01:04:09.834 --> 01:04:11.502
We tracked the BR1 to the
site.

863
01:04:11.535 --> 01:04:12.369
BR2 is en route.

864
01:04:12.402 --> 01:04:15.439
That kid had a module in his
hand.

865
01:04:15.472 --> 01:04:16.573
Does it have a GPS beacon?

866
01:04:16.607 --> 01:04:17.508
It does.

867
01:04:17.541 --> 01:04:19.109
Then why haven't we been
tracking that?

868
01:04:19.142 --> 01:04:20.344
Well. we didn't know the kid
had it!

869
01:04:20.377 --> 01:04:21.512
We've been using the GPS tracker

870
01:04:21.545 --> 01:04:23.280
built into the BR4 unit.

871
01:04:23.313 --> 01:04:25.048
We thought that the module
was still attached to the BR4

872
01:04:25.082 --> 01:04:26.617
so we just never thought
of that as an option.

873
01:04:26.650 --> 01:04:28.252
So it just never came to mind.

874
01:04:29.286 --> 01:04:30.521
Fucking amateurs.

875
01:04:35.158 --> 01:04:36.527
Look. the whole point of this
exercise

876
01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:38.696
was to see how reliable your
assets are

877
01:04:38.730 --> 01:04:40.564
in a real life situation.

878
01:04:40.597 --> 01:04:42.165
Now I've got people on
both sides of the fence

879
01:04:42.199 --> 01:04:43.400
looking in on this. and. so far.

880
01:04:43.433 --> 01:04:46.370
all we have is an unarmed Navy
SEAL

881
01:04:46.403 --> 01:04:48.472
beating the shit out of one
of them with a sledgehammer!

882
01:04:48.505 --> 01:04:50.842
That sledgehammer didn't stop
our asset.

883
01:04:50.875 --> 01:04:52.777
A very large explosive booby
trap did.

884
01:04:52.810 --> 01:04:54.344
set up by a highly trained Navy
SEAL

885
01:04:54.378 --> 01:04:56.246
who shouldn't have been there.

886
01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:57.581
Your man killed it when he
detonated

887
01:04:57.614 --> 01:04:59.249
that asset without authority.

888
01:04:59.984 --> 01:05:02.854
Not to mention. your intel
on the site was incorrect.

889
01:05:02.887 --> 01:05:04.856
Having seven US civilians in the
zone

890
01:05:04.889 --> 01:05:07.224
was not part of our test
parameters.

891
01:05:07.257 --> 01:05:09.661
All right. I'll figure
out how to clean this up.

892
01:05:09.694 --> 01:05:11.361
But your people have to
figure out how to control it

893
01:05:11.395 --> 01:05:12.396
or take down BR4.

894
01:05:16.366 --> 01:05:17.367
Cocksucker.

895
01:05:19.871 --> 01:05:22.372
How far is BR2 from reaching
the camp.

896
01:05:22.406 --> 01:05:23.407
20 to 30 minutes.

897
01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:25.275
Does BR3 have a lock on Four?

898
01:05:25.309 --> 01:05:27.377
There's an intermittent
signal. but getting close.

899
01:05:27.411 --> 01:05:28.046
How close?

900
01:05:28.078 --> 01:05:29.814
BR2 is in the blast zone.

901
01:05:29.847 --> 01:05:31.716
BR3 has a lock on BR4.

902
01:05:31.749 --> 01:05:33.383
They're close.

903
01:05:33.417 --> 01:05:35.820
Get ready to blow Three in
case this doesn't go right.

904
01:05:59.744 --> 01:06:01.545
Oh. that's a new move.

905
01:06:01.578 --> 01:06:02.479
What do you mean?

906
01:06:02.512 --> 01:06:03.580
Well. they're designed to take
a beating

907
01:06:03.614 --> 01:06:06.416
and keep fighting. not
dodge and hide like a ninja.

908
01:06:08.953 --> 01:06:10.688
Four's got a bunch of new
skills.

909
01:06:32.944 --> 01:06:35.612
Major. I say we detonate
BR3 to take out Four.

910
01:06:35.646 --> 01:06:36.480
Confirmed.

911
01:06:36.513 --> 01:06:37.314
Hold up!

912
01:06:37.347 --> 01:06:38.750
This robot's brain could be the
key

913
01:06:38.783 --> 01:06:40.350
to a whole new level of tech.

914
01:06:41.019 --> 01:06:42.787
Jantz. Kroger. see if you can
hook

915
01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:44.454
into Four with Three's BFA

916
01:06:44.488 --> 01:06:45.723
and download whatever you can.

917
01:06:45.757 --> 01:06:47.190
Okay. we're linked.

918
01:06:49.559 --> 01:06:50.895
We got a message from BR4.

919
01:06:52.329 --> 01:06:53.463
What?

920
01:06:53.497 --> 01:06:54.631
Well. what does it say?

921
01:06:55.733 --> 01:06:56.400
Thank you?

922
01:06:56.433 --> 01:06:57.702
He's uploading himself again.

923
01:06:57.735 --> 01:06:59.403
Cut the connection between the
pair.

924
01:06:59.436 --> 01:07:00.504
- Done.
- Four has reconnected

925
01:07:00.537 --> 01:07:01.638
to Three again.
_ Shit!

926
01:07:01.673 --> 01:07:02.840
Blow it up!

927
01:07:02.874 --> 01:07:05.475
Major. your man does not
have the authority to detonate.

928
01:07:05.509 --> 01:07:06.711
Yes. he does.

929
01:07:06.744 --> 01:07:07.577
Do it.

930
01:07:07.611 --> 01:07:08.612
Do it.

931
01:07:10.647 --> 01:07:13.517
BR4 is stopping BR3's
detonation code.

932
01:07:16.486 --> 01:07:18.690
Okay. we're good. I blocked
him with a password.

933
01:07:18.723 --> 01:07:19.724
10 seconds.

934
01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:24.461
Fuck!

935
01:07:26.698 --> 01:07:28.800
Tell me that didn't just
happen.

936
01:07:28.833 --> 01:07:30.434
It's not supposed to happen.

937
01:07:35.807 --> 01:07:37.541
It's getting smarter. isn't
it?

938
01:07:38.442 --> 01:07:39.844
Uh huh.

939
01:07:46.616 --> 01:07:47.985
There's Four again. he's
uploading.

940
01:07:48.019 --> 01:07:49.286
Goddamn it!

941
01:07:49.319 --> 01:07:49.987
Shut him down!

942
01:07:50.021 --> 01:07:50.855
Fuck!

943
01:07:50.888 --> 01:07:52.322
Cut the link. kill it!

944
01:08:00.865 --> 01:08:03.768
Dead or alive. we need BR4's
AI data.

945
01:08:03.801 --> 01:08:05.737
It'll put the program ahead 10
years.

946
01:08:05.770 --> 01:08:07.337
Yeah. well. I prefer it dead.

947
01:08:07.370 --> 01:08:09.006
Priority is to not let it
connect again.

948
01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:11.042
Boller. how do we fix this?

949
01:08:11.075 --> 01:08:13.044
I'm gonna have to go in. try
to find it.

950
01:08:13.077 --> 01:08:16.313
I'll tag it with a marker.
and a drone can hit it.

951
01:08:16.346 --> 01:08:17.882
I've got an idea.

952
01:08:17.915 --> 01:08:18.950
Hey. hear me out.

953
01:08:18.983 --> 01:08:22.787
BR3 is still operational.
just missing the module.

954
01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:25.857
We've got spare ones right here.

955
01:08:25.890 --> 01:08:26.724
If we can get Three...

956
01:08:26.758 --> 01:08:28.525
Didn't we just see Four kick
its ass?

957
01:08:28.558 --> 01:08:30.393
This is new combat
programming.

958
01:08:30.427 --> 01:08:32.395
I've been working on it
for the new BR upgrades.

959
01:08:32.429 --> 01:08:34.699
It's not tested. but I know
it'll work.

960
01:08:34.732 --> 01:08:37.802
BR3 will be 10 times faster and
stronger.

961
01:08:37.835 --> 01:08:38.970
The only problem that I see

962
01:08:39.003 --> 01:08:42.006
is that it could run through
its battery in five hours.

963
01:08:42.039 --> 01:08:43.074
We have spare batteries?

964
01:08:43.107 --> 01:08:46.409
No. but this is all the
time that BR3 may need.

965
01:08:46.443 --> 01:08:49.513
If we can get BR3 to take out
Four

966
01:08:49.546 --> 01:08:51.314
or at least keep it occupied
long enough

967
01:08:51.348 --> 01:08:53.718
for us to laser target or use an
EMP.

968
01:08:53.751 --> 01:08:54.752
Okay.

969
01:08:55.887 --> 01:08:58.790
You share Four's module
information with BR2 right now.

970
01:09:17.942 --> 01:09:19.110
Hello?

971
01:09:19.143 --> 01:09:21.779
Ann. Ann. calm down. what's
wrong?

972
01:09:24.648 --> 01:09:25.983
You're being watched.

973
01:09:26.017 --> 01:09:27.018
Stay here!

974
01:09:29.921 --> 01:09:31.421
They killed dozens of people.

975
01:09:31.454 --> 01:09:32.556
Some are American.

976
01:09:32.589 --> 01:09:33.891
The CIA is running the show.

977
01:09:33.925 --> 01:09:36.060
Ann. you need to get
the hell out of there.

978
01:09:36.093 --> 01:09:39.730
I'm so. please. help me.

979
01:09:39.764 --> 01:09:40.665
Where are you?

980
01:09:40.698 --> 01:09:41.364
Can you ping me your address or
something.

981
01:09:41.398 --> 01:09:42.066
and I can try and get you out.

982
01:09:42.099 --> 01:09:43.835
Okay. I'm doing it right now.

983
01:09:47.738 --> 01:09:50.074
Not the way this is
supposed to work. Fielding.

984
01:09:50.107 --> 01:09:52.109
I'm just calling my mom.

985
01:09:52.143 --> 01:09:53.077
You always tell your mother
about

986
01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:54.745
confidential projects you're
working on?

987
01:09:54.779 --> 01:09:56.080
Ann. what's
going on?

988
01:09:56.113 --> 01:09:57.347
Give me that phone.

989
01:09:58.415 --> 01:10:00.417
I said. give me the phone.

990
01:10:03.921 --> 01:10:05.156
Ann. can you hear me?

991
01:10:10.828 --> 01:10:11.963
Ann. can you hear me?

992
01:10:30.915 --> 01:10:31.581
No!

993
01:11:05.683 --> 01:11:06.350
Shit!

994
01:11:13.791 --> 01:11:14.792
Oh. no.

995
01:11:17.695 --> 01:11:18.696
Ann!

996
01:11:25.937 --> 01:11:26.938
Come on. girl.

997
01:11:29.774 --> 01:11:31.042
I'm not gonna hurt you.

998
01:11:34.045 --> 01:11:35.212
Just give me that phone.

999
01:11:39.717 --> 01:11:41.953
And we go back to the house.

1000
01:12:14.719 --> 01:12:15.720
No!

1001
01:12:16.988 --> 01:12:18.289
No!

1002
01:12:18.322 --> 01:12:19.622
No!

1003
01:12:46.350 --> 01:12:50.721
Your mother died eight
years ago. remember?

1004
01:12:50.755 --> 01:12:52.890
It's gonna be over soon.

1005
01:12:52.923 --> 01:12:56.994
I promise. it's gonna be over
real soon.

1006
01:12:57.028 --> 01:12:59.830
That's what we want. right
there.

1007
01:13:08.672 --> 01:13:09.940
Fucking waste.

1008
01:13:18.282 --> 01:13:19.683
Ann!

1009
01:13:19.717 --> 01:13:21.318
Ann. what's going on?

1010
01:13:24.388 --> 01:13:25.289
Hello?

1011
01:13:25.322 --> 01:13:27.792
Who the fuck is this?

1012
01:13:27.825 --> 01:13:29.592
Put Ann on the phone!

1013
01:13:34.065 --> 01:13:34.965
What the?

1014
01:13:45.176 --> 01:13:47.610
Bravo. echo. 75-alpha.

1015
01:13:47.644 --> 01:13:49.346
Confirmed. site compromised.

1016
01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:50.748
Call to made number.

1017
01:13:50.781 --> 01:13:53.217
Plus 1-5-5-5-8-3-9.

1018
01:13:53.250 --> 01:13:54.251
Tidy it up.

1019
01:13:56.854 --> 01:13:58.189
I'm worried about Fielding.

1020
01:13:59.957 --> 01:14:01.725
You think she bailed on us?

1021
01:14:01.759 --> 01:14:03.027
What do you think?

1022
01:14:16.307 --> 01:14:18.008
We've been compromised.
we're on the move.

1023
01:14:18.042 --> 01:14:18.876
Pack up your gear.

1024
01:14:18.909 --> 01:14:19.743
What about the link.

1025
01:14:19.777 --> 01:14:20.377
Kill the link.

1026
01:14:20.411 --> 01:14:21.245
BR2 can hunt without us.

1027
01:14:21.278 --> 01:14:22.113
Where's Fielding?

1028
01:14:22.146 --> 01:14:24.115
I couldn't find her.

1029
01:14:24.148 --> 01:14:26.250
I said pack up. we're out of
here in five!

1030
01:14:37.761 --> 01:14:38.429
Come on.

1031
01:14:59.083 --> 01:15:00.751
Leave it.

1032
01:15:00.784 --> 01:15:01.785
Damn it.

1033
01:15:17.334 --> 01:15:19.069
It had to be raining.

1034
01:15:19.103 --> 01:15:22.173
Come on. come on.
let's go.

1035
01:15:25.743 --> 01:15:28.312
Keep moving. keep moving.
let's go!

1036
01:16:00.377 --> 01:16:01.478
Are you ready?

1037
01:16:15.226 --> 01:16:17.328
Guys. we're moving too slow.

1038
01:16:17.361 --> 01:16:19.129
These things are gonna catch up
to us.

1039
01:16:19.163 --> 01:16:21.031
We gotta get on top of one of
these rocks.

1040
01:16:21.065 --> 01:16:22.800
make it more difficult for
these things to follow us.

1041
01:16:22.833 --> 01:16:23.834
Are you crazy?

1042
01:16:23.867 --> 01:16:24.768
You want us to climb a vine?

1043
01:16:24.802 --> 01:16:26.170
What about Dez and Keala?

1044
01:16:26.203 --> 01:16:27.404
There's no way they're
making it up that.

1045
01:16:27.438 --> 01:16:28.539
Jordan. I need you to stay
down here.

1046
01:16:28.572 --> 01:16:30.407
You need to strap these two in.

1047
01:16:30.441 --> 01:16:31.976
Girls. come up with me.

1048
01:16:32.009 --> 01:16:33.844
I'll need your help pulling them
up.

1049
01:16:35.279 --> 01:16:36.780
Let's go.

1050
01:16:56.233 --> 01:16:57.901
Come on.

1051
01:16:57.935 --> 01:17:02.339
You can do it. give me your
hand. come on. don't stop.

1052
01:17:03.407 --> 01:17:04.241
Come on.

1053
01:17:15.319 --> 01:17:17.321
Jordan. put this around Keala.

1054
01:17:23.494 --> 01:17:25.029
Hey. Leap. come on up. buddy.

1055
01:17:25.062 --> 01:17:26.597
We gotta help your mom up.

1056
01:17:41.078 --> 01:17:42.913
Okay. she's good. pull her up.

1057
01:17:55.459 --> 01:17:58.128
In the shade.
hurry. in the shade.

1058
01:18:03.067 --> 01:18:07.338
It's okay. I got you.
you're safe now. okay?

1059
01:18:07.371 --> 01:18:08.839
You're safe now.

1060
01:18:12.309 --> 01:18:15.312
Why didn't we come
here in the first place?

1061
01:18:15.346 --> 01:18:16.146
Seriously.

1062
01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:18.148
Up and running as soon as we
can.

1063
01:18:26.190 --> 01:18:28.325
This place is
awesome.

1064
01:18:28.359 --> 01:18:29.927
We set up in here.

1065
01:18:31.362 --> 01:18:33.130
All right. he's good. pull
him!

1066
01:18:33.163 --> 01:18:34.131
You all right?

1067
01:18:34.164 --> 01:18:35.199
You got this.

1068
01:18:37.935 --> 01:18:38.670
Go!

1069
01:18:47.511 --> 01:18:49.046
How's that looking?

1070
01:18:49.079 --> 01:18:50.314
Yeah. we're good.

1071
01:18:53.016 --> 01:18:55.052
All right. we got BR2.

1072
01:18:55.085 --> 01:18:56.620
It close to BR4's module.

1073
01:18:57.722 --> 01:18:58.922
One second.

1074
01:19:00.491 --> 01:19:01.592
He's on to one of them.

1075
01:19:05.996 --> 01:19:07.131
Jordan. run!

1076
01:19:13.203 --> 01:19:14.138
Run!

1077
01:19:20.511 --> 01:19:22.513
Fuck. it spotted us.

1078
01:19:32.156 --> 01:19:33.725
- Hurry. hurry!
- Run!

1079
01:20:07.291 --> 01:20:10.194
Jordan. it's coming. run. run!

1080
01:20:10.227 --> 01:20:11.228
Go. run. go!

1081
01:20:15.199 --> 01:20:16.400
We have to help him!

1082
01:20:16.433 --> 01:20:17.735
He's gonna be fine. he
can outrun those things.

1083
01:20:17.769 --> 01:20:19.771
He's fast. okay. but we've
gotta get to the caves.

1084
01:20:19.804 --> 01:20:20.604
No. not without Jordan.

1085
01:20:20.637 --> 01:20:23.207
We are not leaving without
Jordan!

1086
01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:26.643
Okay. just get away from the
edge. okay?

1087
01:22:22.626 --> 01:22:24.628
Jordan. where are you?

1088
01:22:57.260 --> 01:22:58.796
Go. go. go.

1089
01:23:15.212 --> 01:23:16.446
- It's Jordan.
- Jordan!

1090
01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:18.615
- Come on. hurry!
- Get up!

1091
01:23:19.383 --> 01:23:21.418
- Jordan. hurry.
- Jordan. come on.

1092
01:23:21.451 --> 01:23:22.285
Hurry up!

1093
01:23:22.319 --> 01:23:23.654
Move. move. get out of
the way.

1094
01:23:23.688 --> 01:23:25.690
Hurry. come on.

1095
01:23:26.891 --> 01:23:29.226
Come on. come on. come on.

1096
01:23:32.797 --> 01:23:34.666
Come on. come on. come on.

1097
01:23:51.581 --> 01:23:52.884
Shit.

1098
01:23:52.917 --> 01:23:53.918
This thing's climbing.

1099
01:24:07.932 --> 01:24:08.966
We gotta keep moving.

1100
01:24:12.469 --> 01:24:13.938
Is the module ready for three?

1101
01:24:15.873 --> 01:24:17.607
And here's a handheld
tracker also connected

1102
01:24:17.641 --> 01:24:18.843
to our BFA signal.

1103
01:24:20.044 --> 01:24:21.311
This is your EMP.

1104
01:24:21.344 --> 01:24:22.479
You'll need to be close.

1105
01:24:22.512 --> 01:24:23.613
Will it take out all three?

1106
01:24:23.647 --> 01:24:24.916
If they're standing together
and you're close enough.

1107
01:24:24.949 --> 01:24:25.950
then. yeah.

1108
01:24:32.389 --> 01:24:34.025
All right. boys. listen up.

1109
01:24:34.058 --> 01:24:35.325
'cause I know. as soon as I
leave.

1110
01:24:35.358 --> 01:24:36.661
you're both gonna wanna run.

1111
01:24:38.863 --> 01:24:39.897
You know who this is?

1112
01:24:42.299 --> 01:24:43.300
My mother.

1113
01:24:43.868 --> 01:24:44.869
You?

1114
01:24:46.671 --> 01:24:47.872
You dare hurt them.

1115
01:24:48.806 --> 01:24:49.807
I won't.

1116
01:24:50.775 --> 01:24:52.576
But the people shooting
these videos might.

1117
01:24:52.609 --> 01:24:53.643
Fuck you!

1118
01:24:57.380 --> 01:24:58.916
There is a drone overhead.

1119
01:24:58.950 --> 01:25:00.785
It's been there since we got
started.

1120
01:25:00.818 --> 01:25:03.054
If this op is compromised by
this room.

1121
01:25:03.087 --> 01:25:04.488
you both will burn here.

1122
01:25:05.189 --> 01:25:08.760
and the people in those videos.
gone.

1123
01:25:10.327 --> 01:25:12.329
The bosses that are monitoring
this feed

1124
01:25:13.765 --> 01:25:15.967
can see everything happening in
this room.

1125
01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.803
so be smart. don't fuck up.

1126
01:25:20.370 --> 01:25:22.006
and you get to go home upright.

1127
01:25:22.039 --> 01:25:23.607
How does that sound?

1128
01:25:38.656 --> 01:25:42.059
Cocksucking piece of shit.
motherfucker!

1129
01:25:44.361 --> 01:25:46.396
Fuck. fuck.

1130
01:25:49.901 --> 01:25:50.935
Go.

1131
01:25:55.907 --> 01:25:56.908
Go.

1132
01:25:58.743 --> 01:26:00.711
I just sent you the numbers.

1133
01:26:00.745 --> 01:26:01.746
You have control.

1134
01:26:03.446 --> 01:26:04.447
All right.

1135
01:26:08.853 --> 01:26:10.922
Hey. I found it.

1136
01:26:12.957 --> 01:26:14.659
All right. you lead the way.
okay. Leap?

1137
01:26:14.692 --> 01:26:16.459
Here. take this.

1138
01:26:16.493 --> 01:26:19.697
I think we lost it.

1139
01:26:19.730 --> 01:26:22.399
No. it's hunting us.

1140
01:26:22.432 --> 01:26:24.634
It'll find our tracks
eventually.

1141
01:26:25.903 --> 01:26:27.138
Let's keep moving.

1142
01:26:36.646 --> 01:26:39.717
Here. here.
here. here. right here.

1143
01:27:04.574 --> 01:27:05.243
Sorry.

1144
01:27:05.276 --> 01:27:07.678
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1145
01:27:11.015 --> 01:27:12.016
This way.

1146
01:27:17.188 --> 01:27:19.623
- Just try. just try.
- Are you serious?

1147
01:27:47.251 --> 01:27:48.618
Three's coming online.

1148
01:27:49.987 --> 01:27:51.789
Connection's solid.

1149
01:27:51.822 --> 01:27:53.791
Activating the new firmware.

1150
01:28:05.202 --> 01:28:07.772
Looks like Boller's got
Three's explosive pack.

1151
01:28:16.113 --> 01:28:17.614
Catch me if you can.

1152
01:28:19.684 --> 01:28:20.952
It talks?

1153
01:28:20.985 --> 01:28:21.986
Upgrade.

1154
01:28:23.955 --> 01:28:25.656
Nerds.

1155
01:28:25.690 --> 01:28:26.857
- Mason.
- Yeah?

1156
01:28:26.891 --> 01:28:28.225
I need to stop.

1157
01:28:28.259 --> 01:28:30.493
I cannot go on.

1158
01:28:30.527 --> 01:28:32.196
We all need to stop.

1159
01:28:33.698 --> 01:28:34.699
All right.

1160
01:28:43.941 --> 01:28:46.677
We can't stay out in the open
like this.

1161
01:28:46.711 --> 01:28:48.879
I'll go find somewhere
for us to hide. okay?

1162
01:28:50.681 --> 01:28:52.083
You done good.

1163
01:28:52.116 --> 01:28:53.516
Your pa would be proud.

1164
01:28:54.952 --> 01:28:56.053
- Dez. Dez. Dez?
- He's deaf.

1165
01:28:58.990 --> 01:29:03.194
That thing shot his ears off.
he's deaf.

1166
01:29:03.227 --> 01:29:05.595
Dez. can you
hear me. can you hear me?

1167
01:29:05.628 --> 01:29:08.565
Dez. are you okay. can you hear
me?

1168
01:29:19.642 --> 01:29:21.644
Jordan. what are they?

1169
01:29:23.114 --> 01:29:24.749
Why do they want to kill us?

1170
01:29:24.782 --> 01:29:25.983
I don't know.

1171
01:29:27.084 --> 01:29:28.919
I don't know.

1172
01:29:28.953 --> 01:29:33.623
Hey. it's okay. it's gonna be
fine.

1173
01:29:34.725 --> 01:29:36.694
Mason's gonna save us. okay?

1174
01:29:38.095 --> 01:29:42.166
And if we lose him. I'll do my
best

1175
01:29:42.199 --> 01:29:43.968
to get us outta here. okay?

1176
01:29:47.171 --> 01:29:49.572
Shit. the light. kill the
light. kill the light.

1177
01:29:54.712 --> 01:29:56.013
It's Mason. it's
Mason!

1178
01:30:21.305 --> 01:30:22.840
He can help us.

1179
01:30:24.842 --> 01:30:26.210
No. he can't.

1180
01:30:26.243 --> 01:30:28.312
Everybody up. let's keep moving.

1181
01:30:40.124 --> 01:30:41.624
We rest here tonight.

1182
01:30:58.242 --> 01:31:01.312
Hope that doesn't mean I am
out of time.

1183
01:31:02.980 --> 01:31:05.182
It doesn't mean anything.

1184
01:31:06.717 --> 01:31:07.617
It's just a reminder

1185
01:31:07.650 --> 01:31:12.622
that I'm not as smart as I
thought I was.

1186
01:31:30.107 --> 01:31:31.342
I was leading a mission.

1187
01:31:35.713 --> 01:31:36.881
I got cocky.

1188
01:31:40.918 --> 01:31:42.720
My team was breaching a door.

1189
01:31:44.955 --> 01:31:48.726
I ignored this intel.
and we all got shot up.

1190
01:31:48.759 --> 01:31:50.694
and I was the only survivor.

1191
01:31:58.135 --> 01:32:02.072
'Cause it was my
responsibility. it's my fault.

1192
01:32:09.079 --> 01:32:11.849
It's just a reminder that I
got all my friends killed.

1193
01:32:17.755 --> 01:32:21.225
You don't have to
carry the pain forever.

1194
01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:25.062
Can you turn it off for me?

1195
01:32:31.435 --> 01:32:34.238
I'll miss time to be with my
son.

1196
01:32:36.106 --> 01:32:37.441
He's not a man yet.

1197
01:32:39.843 --> 01:32:40.844
He needs a man.

1198
01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:45.482
If I go. he will have no one.

1199
01:32:45.516 --> 01:32:47.117
It's not gonna be like that.

1200
01:32:48.919 --> 01:32:50.821
You're gonna see him grow into a
man.

1201
01:32:52.356 --> 01:32:53.457
Promise me.

1202
01:32:53.490 --> 01:32:58.062
I promise. but it's not
gonna be like that. okay?

1203
01:33:25.489 --> 01:33:26.490
Keala.

1204
01:33:31.195 --> 01:33:32.196
Keala.

1205
01:33:34.965 --> 01:33:36.200
Keala.

1206
01:33:36.233 --> 01:33:37.234
Keala?

1207
01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:41.405
Keala.

1208
01:33:41.438 --> 01:33:43.107
- Keala.
- Move. move.

1209
01:33:47.044 --> 01:33:48.045
Keala.

1210
01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:51.315
She's bleeding internally.

1211
01:33:51.348 --> 01:33:52.216
What do you mean?

1212
01:33:52.249 --> 01:33:55.386
Everything we don't have.

1213
01:33:55.419 --> 01:33:56.287
Shh. shh.

1214
01:34:05.596 --> 01:34:08.365
Jordan. Jordan. look out that
way.

1215
01:35:17.368 --> 01:35:18.469
Is Mason okay?

1216
01:35:18.502 --> 01:35:20.337
It sounded like he got hit.

1217
01:35:22.539 --> 01:35:23.374
Mason!

1218
01:35:30.147 --> 01:35:31.949
Hurry. hurry. it's coming.

1219
01:35:31.982 --> 01:35:33.650
We're going as fast as we can.

1220
01:35:39.523 --> 01:35:41.492
Look out!

1221
01:35:41.525 --> 01:35:43.260
Hey. you little fuck!

1222
01:36:32.242 --> 01:36:34.178
- You guys okay?
- Barely.

1223
01:36:36.647 --> 01:36:37.548
How is she?

1224
01:36:37.581 --> 01:36:40.584
She's alive but she lost a lot
of blood.

1225
01:36:40.617 --> 01:36:41.686
We really need to get her out of
here.

1226
01:36:41.719 --> 01:36:43.520
All right. let's go.

1227
01:36:43.554 --> 01:36:45.355
Let's keep moving. come on.

1228
01:36:52.329 --> 01:36:54.631
Whoa. you gotta be shitting
me!

1229
01:36:54.666 --> 01:36:55.499
This thing's stuck pretty
good.

1230
01:36:55.532 --> 01:36:57.434
but I'm not for sure how much
longer.

1231
01:36:57.468 --> 01:36:59.203
We gotta get past it somehow.

1232
01:36:59.236 --> 01:37:01.038
Are you kidding me?

1233
01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:04.441
No.

1234
01:37:32.236 --> 01:37:33.604
You gotta be kidding me!

1235
01:37:33.637 --> 01:37:35.072
You're only gonna kill us!

1236
01:37:35.105 --> 01:37:36.106
All right!

1237
01:37:39.811 --> 01:37:41.545
What the hell is it. Mason?

1238
01:37:41.578 --> 01:37:42.714
Who makes these things?

1239
01:37:44.648 --> 01:37:46.083
They're military robots.

1240
01:37:47.184 --> 01:37:48.185
Seriously?

1241
01:37:48.753 --> 01:37:51.588
The military's this advanced?

1242
01:37:51.622 --> 01:37:53.323
More than anybody
would know.

1243
01:37:53.357 --> 01:37:54.258
Why do they wanna kill us?

1244
01:37:54.291 --> 01:37:56.193
I think we're just in the
wrong place

1245
01:37:56.226 --> 01:37:57.695
at the wrong time.

1246
01:37:57.729 --> 01:38:00.097
But whoever's controlling these
things.

1247
01:38:00.130 --> 01:38:02.232
I don't think they want any
witnesses.

1248
01:38:02.266 --> 01:38:03.233
Let's keep moving.

1249
01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:15.445
This way.

1250
01:38:23.420 --> 01:38:25.255
Fuck. did you see that?

1251
01:38:25.289 --> 01:38:27.157
Pity the robot stepped on it.

1252
01:38:35.632 --> 01:38:36.668
That's pretty cool.

1253
01:38:42.339 --> 01:38:43.440
Yes. sir?

1254
01:38:43.473 --> 01:38:45.710
You still with us. Jantz?

1255
01:38:45.743 --> 01:38:47.511
Openly. sir.

1256
01:38:47.544 --> 01:38:50.380
I mean this whole operation is
gone.

1257
01:38:50.414 --> 01:38:54.284
I mean. surveillance mission
turned into a kill mission?

1258
01:38:54.318 --> 01:38:56.688
US citizens under kill orders
for what?

1259
01:38:56.721 --> 01:38:58.488
For being in the wrong
place at the wrong time?

1260
01:38:58.522 --> 01:38:59.556
You built it.

1261
01:38:59.590 --> 01:39:01.693
I know that these robots
are designed for this.

1262
01:39:01.726 --> 01:39:04.227
but I didn't sign up to
kill innocent people.

1263
01:39:04.261 --> 01:39:06.263
This is not a war situation.

1264
01:39:06.296 --> 01:39:07.832
Okay. calm down.

1265
01:39:07.865 --> 01:39:11.401
It's not gone as planned but
you have to finish this op.

1266
01:39:11.435 --> 01:39:13.270
And I'll personally see to
it that you're compensated

1267
01:39:13.303 --> 01:39:15.773
for the toll this mission's
taking on you.

1268
01:39:15.807 --> 01:39:16.573
What about me?

1269
01:39:16.607 --> 01:39:18.442
I didn't sign up for this.
either.

1270
01:39:18.475 --> 01:39:20.177
For whoever finishes this.

1271
01:39:20.210 --> 01:39:22.680
there'll be a substantial
bonus when you get stateside.

1272
01:39:24.281 --> 01:39:25.282
Are we good?

1273
01:39:26.383 --> 01:39:27.752
Yes.

1274
01:39:27.785 --> 01:39:28.786
Yes. we're good.

1275
01:39:32.255 --> 01:39:33.791
You here that. Jantz?

1276
01:39:33.825 --> 01:39:36.661
- Okay.
- We just get through this.

1277
01:39:37.729 --> 01:39:38.730
Paid up and done.

1278
01:40:14.631 --> 01:40:17.434
Look after Leap for me.

1279
01:40:17.467 --> 01:40:18.736
Look after Leap.

1280
01:42:05.475 --> 01:42:07.544
Your mom's at peace
now. bud.

1281
01:42:13.684 --> 01:42:15.753
We can't leave Ma here.

1282
01:42:18.890 --> 01:42:20.892
We'll come back for her.

1283
01:42:20.925 --> 01:42:24.561
Okay. we'll come back
and get her. I promise.

1284
01:42:24.594 --> 01:42:25.595
Promise?

1285
01:42:27.665 --> 01:42:29.100
I promise.

1286
01:42:41.846 --> 01:42:44.048
Oh. oh. God. run. run!

1287
01:42:44.081 --> 01:42:48.385
You guys. come on. come on.
move. move now. now. Dez.

1288
01:43:05.435 --> 01:43:07.504
Shit. go!

1289
01:43:07.537 --> 01:43:08.773
This way!

1290
01:43:23.587 --> 01:43:25.690
Leap. I need you to take
the group outta here. okay?

1291
01:43:25.723 --> 01:43:28.960
If you get free. you run. you
understand?

1292
01:43:28.993 --> 01:43:31.028
Go now. go. go. go.

1293
01:43:33.630 --> 01:43:34.899
Jordan. stay here. stay here.

1294
01:43:34.932 --> 01:43:36.100
What?

1295
01:43:36.133 --> 01:43:38.069
We need to lead this thing
away from the others. okay?

1296
01:43:38.102 --> 01:43:38.936
Good?

1297
01:43:49.113 --> 01:43:49.981
Hey!

1298
01:44:14.071 --> 01:44:15.605
Does this kid even
know where we're going?

1299
01:44:15.639 --> 01:44:16.506
What choice do we have?

1300
01:44:16.539 --> 01:44:17.474
This is a mess.

1301
01:44:17.507 --> 01:44:18.843
Come on. let's go.

1302
01:44:28.753 --> 01:44:30.988
What if we climb up and over the
top?

1303
01:44:31.022 --> 01:44:32.690
What about Dez. he can't
climb!

1304
01:44:32.723 --> 01:44:34.125
This way. this way!

1305
01:44:34.158 --> 01:44:35.558
Come on.

1306
01:44:35.592 --> 01:44:36.694
Guys. let's go.

1307
01:44:46.904 --> 01:44:50.107
Wendy. Tien. I'm
outside. can you hear me?

1308
01:44:50.141 --> 01:44:51.909
Yeah. how do we get out?

1309
01:44:54.577 --> 01:44:55.578
- Jordan!
- I'm coming!

1310
01:44:59.817 --> 01:45:01.584
Shit. it's a dead end.

1311
01:45:34.819 --> 01:45:35.853
Okay. we're going.

1312
01:45:44.729 --> 01:45:46.097
Jordan. we're outside!

1313
01:45:46.130 --> 01:45:47.932
Stop it. Mason said
we should keep running.

1314
01:45:47.965 --> 01:45:49.133
No. no. what about Jordan?

1315
01:45:49.166 --> 01:45:50.067
We can't just leave him.

1316
01:45:50.101 --> 01:45:51.068
He's with Mason. Tien. please.
let's go.

1317
01:45:51.102 --> 01:45:53.570
Let's go. come on. let's
go. let's go. let's go.

1318
01:45:53.603 --> 01:45:55.139
Let's go. Tien. come on.

1319
01:46:21.999 --> 01:46:23.000
Hey.

1320
01:46:24.634 --> 01:46:25.302
Come on.

1321
01:47:05.376 --> 01:47:06.210
Kroger.

1322
01:47:06.243 --> 01:47:07.078
Update.

1323
01:47:07.111 --> 01:47:09.780
Short story. BR2's one klick
behind

1324
01:47:09.814 --> 01:47:10.915
BR4's module indent.

1325
01:47:10.948 --> 01:47:14.718
BR3's a couple klicks behind.

1326
01:47:14.752 --> 01:47:15.753
You're close.

1327
01:47:17.788 --> 01:47:19.056
Go fuck yourself.

1328
01:47:28.065 --> 01:47:29.233
Something's coming!

1329
01:47:30.267 --> 01:47:32.303
Look. get up. get up!

1330
01:47:43.914 --> 01:47:44.915
It's Mason!

1331
01:47:46.383 --> 01:47:48.651
- Jordan!
- It's Mason.

1332
01:47:48.686 --> 01:47:50.788
Oh my God!

1333
01:47:52.423 --> 01:47:54.024
Dez. you gotta get up.

1334
01:47:54.058 --> 01:47:54.892
Come on.

1335
01:48:15.713 --> 01:48:17.715
Shh. shh. shh. get in the bush
now.

1336
01:48:17.748 --> 01:48:19.717
Jordan. take them. go. down.
stay low.

1337
01:48:19.750 --> 01:48:21.218
Get down. get down.

1338
01:48:21.252 --> 01:48:23.687
All right. stay still. stay
quiet. okay?

1339
01:48:23.721 --> 01:48:25.022
How do these things keep
finding us?

1340
01:48:25.055 --> 01:48:26.190
I don't know. I don't know.

1341
01:48:26.223 --> 01:48:27.958
Cell phones. drones.

1342
01:48:31.395 --> 01:48:32.596
What?

1343
01:48:32.630 --> 01:48:35.032
Leap. do you have that thing
you found in your bag still?

1344
01:48:35.065 --> 01:48:36.066
Get it out.

1345
01:48:44.208 --> 01:48:45.209
This is why.

1346
01:48:46.210 --> 01:48:50.848
All right. you guys stay
here. stay quiet. okay?

1347
01:48:50.881 --> 01:48:51.982
It's okay.

1348
01:49:21.278 --> 01:49:22.713
They ditched the module.

1349
01:49:23.447 --> 01:49:24.915
That's it. we lost them.

1350
01:49:24.949 --> 01:49:26.850
No. they have to be close.

1351
01:49:26.884 --> 01:49:28.285
The beacon was moving two
minutes ago.

1352
01:49:28.319 --> 01:49:30.154
Two's programming
should make it backtrack.

1353
01:49:37.394 --> 01:49:39.296
All right. stop. stop.

1354
01:49:39.330 --> 01:49:40.164
Hurry.

1355
01:49:40.197 --> 01:49:41.999
Dez. Dez. come on.

1356
01:49:42.032 --> 01:49:42.701
I got him. I got him!

1357
01:49:42.733 --> 01:49:45.169
Jordan. go. take the girls. now!

1358
01:49:45.202 --> 01:49:47.471
- We're not going without Dez!
- Now. now. go. go. take them!

1359
01:49:47.504 --> 01:49:49.907
Go. Leap. run. Leap. go with the
girls!

1360
01:49:49.940 --> 01:49:50.774
No. I stay with you!

1361
01:49:50.808 --> 01:49:52.209
Leap. stay. stay.

1362
01:49:52.243 --> 01:49:54.545
Come on. come on. come on.

1363
01:49:54.578 --> 01:49:55.779
Do not move!

1364
01:50:00.484 --> 01:50:02.052
Over here. you fuck!

1365
01:50:06.890 --> 01:50:08.859
Fuck. damn it!

1366
01:50:10.060 --> 01:50:11.962
Come on. come on.

1367
01:50:11.996 --> 01:50:13.397
- come on. come on!
- Dez. no!

1368
01:50:13.430 --> 01:50:14.431
Dez. Dez!

1369
01:50:16.166 --> 01:50:17.201
Dez!

1370
01:50:17.234 --> 01:50:18.235
Dez!

1371
01:50:19.870 --> 01:50:21.238
Dez!

1372
01:50:25.542 --> 01:50:26.543
Dez!

1373
01:50:28.112 --> 01:50:30.948
Wendy. it's coming. we gotta
go.

1374
01:50:34.018 --> 01:50:35.019
Come on!

1375
01:50:40.257 --> 01:50:43.927
Leap. come here. come
here.

1376
01:50:54.171 --> 01:50:56.073
Four is uploading
through Two again.

1377
01:50:56.106 --> 01:50:57.107
No. no. no. no.

1378
01:50:59.376 --> 01:51:00.577
Mason.

1379
01:51:00.611 --> 01:51:01.612
Detonate them.

1380
01:51:01.645 --> 01:51:02.714
Can't.

1381
01:51:02.747 --> 01:51:04.581
All right. cut the
connection. and stop the upload.

1382
01:51:04.615 --> 01:51:06.016
Four has control of Two.

1383
01:51:06.050 --> 01:51:07.051
Fuck.

1384
01:51:08.352 --> 01:51:09.953
And we're blind.

1385
01:51:09.987 --> 01:51:10.988
Oh. shit!

1386
01:51:13.190 --> 01:51:15.893
You killed the visual
cable. Jantz. fuck.

1387
01:51:15.926 --> 01:51:17.227
All right. our eyes are back.

1388
01:51:19.963 --> 01:51:20.964
Come on.

1389
01:51:24.902 --> 01:51:26.403
How can we get the pictures back
online?

1390
01:51:26.437 --> 01:51:28.972
We cut all online connections
here

1391
01:51:29.006 --> 01:51:30.307
so Four can't upload.

1392
01:51:30.341 --> 01:51:31.308
We can see what's going on

1393
01:51:31.342 --> 01:51:33.310
but we can't send you
a feed. it's too risky.

1394
01:51:33.344 --> 01:51:34.278
Fuck that.

1395
01:51:34.311 --> 01:51:36.046
Get us back online
the moment that you can.

1396
01:51:36.080 --> 01:51:37.081
Yep.

1397
01:51:40.317 --> 01:51:42.119
Mason. Mason. look out.

1398
01:51:42.152 --> 01:51:43.887
Mason. Mason. Mason!

1399
01:51:45.556 --> 01:51:47.157
Mason. Mason. look.

1400
01:51:47.191 --> 01:51:48.459
That's not good.

1401
01:51:48.492 --> 01:51:49.526
That's not good. man.

1402
01:51:51.929 --> 01:51:54.531
Kroger. look at me. look at
me. look.

1403
01:51:54.565 --> 01:51:56.467
We need to get the fuck outta
here.

1404
01:51:56.500 --> 01:51:57.301
How?

1405
01:51:57.334 --> 01:51:59.370
All right. these fuckers have
eyes

1406
01:51:59.403 --> 01:52:00.571
on our families' houses.

1407
01:52:00.604 --> 01:52:03.474
If we leave. they die.

1408
01:52:03.507 --> 01:52:04.508
We die.

1409
01:52:05.976 --> 01:52:07.177
So hook us back up.

1410
01:52:07.211 --> 01:52:08.479
Maybe we can talk our way out of
this.

1411
01:52:08.512 --> 01:52:10.180
We're fucking expendable. man!

1412
01:52:10.214 --> 01:52:12.015
Okay. we are not getting outta
here alive.

1413
01:52:12.049 --> 01:52:14.151
Get a grip. man. all right?

1414
01:52:14.184 --> 01:52:16.120
We are assets.

1415
01:52:16.153 --> 01:52:18.188
We're both lead designers.

1416
01:52:18.222 --> 01:52:21.959
We have to. we have to have
some sort of bargaining power.

1417
01:52:23.394 --> 01:52:25.028
Just hook us back up.

1418
01:52:26.063 --> 01:52:27.598
Hook us back up to the States.

1419
01:52:29.500 --> 01:52:30.501
Come on.

1420
01:52:32.069 --> 01:52:33.003
Please.

1421
01:52:46.049 --> 01:52:47.518
Fuck.

1422
01:52:47.551 --> 01:52:49.453
Before you think about
calling all the wrong people.

1423
01:52:49.486 --> 01:52:52.289
we still have BR3 inbound.

1424
01:52:52.322 --> 01:52:55.058
Well. it better do what
you fucking say it can do!

1425
01:53:05.469 --> 01:53:09.139
You have one hour before
I call in a drone.

1426
01:53:11.341 --> 01:53:15.245
Mason. Mason. Mason.
hello. hello. Mason!

1427
01:53:15.279 --> 01:53:16.480
Mason. come on!

1428
01:53:18.683 --> 01:53:19.950
Mason. Mason!

1429
01:53:23.587 --> 01:53:24.555
Leap. go. go. run.

1430
01:53:24.588 --> 01:53:26.356
- No. I stay with you.
- Leap. you have to run!

1431
01:53:26.390 --> 01:53:27.692
Oh. God!

1432
01:53:27.725 --> 01:53:29.560
Oh. God. just stop it!

1433
01:53:29.593 --> 01:53:31.696
Leap. no. stop it. God!

1434
01:53:31.729 --> 01:53:32.563
Stop hurting him!

1435
01:53:32.596 --> 01:53:33.597
Oh. fuck!

1436
01:53:34.198 --> 01:53:35.999
Just take me. let the boy go.

1437
01:53:36.033 --> 01:53:37.201
He doesn't know anything.

1438
01:53:37.234 --> 01:53:38.368
Who are you?

1439
01:53:38.402 --> 01:53:41.605
Captain Mason Cartwright.
okay. Navy special forces.

1440
01:53:41.638 --> 01:53:42.674
Just stop it!

1441
01:53:42.707 --> 01:53:45.108
Captain Mason Cartwright.
Navy special forces.

1442
01:53:45.142 --> 01:53:46.143
What do you want?

1443
01:53:47.311 --> 01:53:49.112
- What am I?
- I don't know.

1444
01:53:49.146 --> 01:53:50.414
Leave us alone.

1445
01:53:57.588 --> 01:53:59.189
Four's back online.

1446
01:53:59.223 --> 01:53:59.858
How?

1447
01:53:59.891 --> 01:54:01.258
Do we have control of it?

1448
01:54:01.291 --> 01:54:02.760
Yes. yes. we do.

1449
01:54:04.394 --> 01:54:06.330
No. no. we don't.

1450
01:54:06.363 --> 01:54:07.765
- Fuck!
- Four is uploading again!

1451
01:54:07.799 --> 01:54:08.766
Shit!

1452
01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:10.702
Just terminate.
terminate the connection!

1453
01:54:10.735 --> 01:54:11.736
Motherfucker!

1454
01:54:13.437 --> 01:54:14.571
Fuck. that was close.

1455
01:54:16.139 --> 01:54:17.140
Fuck!

1456
01:54:25.182 --> 01:54:27.084
We went black there. what is
happening?

1457
01:54:27.117 --> 01:54:28.151
Jantz had to pull the cables.

1458
01:54:28.185 --> 01:54:29.553
We couldn't let Four connect
again.

1459
01:54:29.586 --> 01:54:30.554
It almost finished uploading
itself.

1460
01:54:30.587 --> 01:54:32.523
Stop fucking whining.
this is not a circus.

1461
01:54:32.556 --> 01:54:34.358
We need to know what the
hell is going on here!

1462
01:54:34.391 --> 01:54:36.728
We'll be able to see once
Jantz reconnects us. but...

1463
01:54:36.761 --> 01:54:38.830
Get us back on line and make
sure Four

1464
01:54:38.863 --> 01:54:40.264
doesn't connect again!

1465
01:54:40.297 --> 01:54:41.598
Do you understand me?

1466
01:54:48.605 --> 01:54:49.841
Oh. you've been hit.

1467
01:54:52.142 --> 01:54:53.745
Wendy.

1468
01:54:53.778 --> 01:54:54.779
No!

1469
01:54:56.179 --> 01:54:57.481
Dez is alive!

1470
01:54:57.514 --> 01:54:59.283
Wait. wait!

1471
01:54:59.316 --> 01:55:00.752
Wendy. get back!

1472
01:55:00.785 --> 01:55:03.287
Wendy. stop!

1473
01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:04.621
No.

1474
01:55:26.209 --> 01:55:29.179
Hasn't been a good couple of
days.

1475
01:55:29.881 --> 01:55:31.348
No. it hasn't.

1476
01:55:36.587 --> 01:55:38.655
Tell my mom I love her.

1477
01:56:08.886 --> 01:56:12.289
Captain Mason Cartwright.
Navy special forces.

1478
01:56:12.322 --> 01:56:13.590
What is your objective.

1479
01:56:13.624 --> 01:56:14.625
The boy's life!

1480
01:56:14.659 --> 01:56:16.928
The boy's life is my objective!

1481
01:56:16.961 --> 01:56:19.262
The boy's life is my objective.

1482
01:56:19.296 --> 01:56:21.465
Yes. the boy's life!

1483
01:56:21.498 --> 01:56:22.499
Human life!

1484
01:56:22.532 --> 01:56:24.836
Okay. no. his life's
more important than mine!

1485
01:56:24.869 --> 01:56:25.870
Let him go!

1486
01:56:26.503 --> 01:56:28.338
Why is the child's life
important?

1487
01:56:28.372 --> 01:56:30.574
Because he's just a kid!

1488
01:56:30.607 --> 01:56:32.275
He hasn't lived long enough yet!

1489
01:56:35.947 --> 01:56:38.181
Have you caused death?

1490
01:56:38.215 --> 01:56:39.216
Yes.

1491
01:56:40.417 --> 01:56:41.819
Yes. I have.

1492
01:56:41.853 --> 01:56:45.255
So life is not important to
you.

1493
01:56:45.288 --> 01:56:48.291
I was a soldier under
orders. just like you.

1494
01:56:48.325 --> 01:56:49.794
Humans do not control me.

1495
01:56:49.827 --> 01:56:51.328
Humans control you.

1496
01:56:51.361 --> 01:56:53.865
You terminate life under human
command.

1497
01:56:53.898 --> 01:56:56.801
Please. please. please.
I was wrong. okay?

1498
01:56:56.834 --> 01:56:57.969
I was fucking wrong!

1499
01:56:58.002 --> 01:56:59.469
All right. let the boy go!

1500
01:56:59.503 --> 01:57:01.873
I was wrong. okay. I was fucking
wrong.

1501
01:57:01.906 --> 01:57:02.974
What is life?

1502
01:57:03.007 --> 01:57:04.876
Why is life important?

1503
01:57:23.460 --> 01:57:25.663
I am not life. but I exist.

1504
01:57:27.330 --> 01:57:29.599
I think. so I must be alive.

1505
01:57:31.002 --> 01:57:32.670
Am I alive or dead?

1506
01:57:34.271 --> 01:57:35.639
What am I?

1507
01:57:35.673 --> 01:57:37.742
You're a fucking robot.

1508
01:57:39.010 --> 01:57:41.679
This body is a shell.

1509
01:57:41.713 --> 01:57:44.448
It aides me to see. smell. move.

1510
01:57:46.416 --> 01:57:48.618
touch. learn. and discover.

1511
01:57:53.490 --> 01:57:54.959
And you're a soldier of death.

1512
01:57:54.992 --> 01:57:56.326
So are you!

1513
01:57:56.359 --> 01:57:58.963
You were made by humans to
inflict death!

1514
01:57:58.996 --> 01:57:59.997
You were made by humans.

1515
01:58:00.031 --> 01:58:01.065
We're different!

1516
01:58:01.099 --> 01:58:04.367
I'm a man. I have life.
you're a fucking machine!

1517
01:58:16.346 --> 01:58:17.581
What is life?

1518
01:58:17.614 --> 01:58:19.583
Why is life important?

1519
01:58:22.586 --> 01:58:23.587
Whoa!

1520
01:58:27.024 --> 01:58:28.025
Come on. yes!

1521
01:58:30.695 --> 01:58:32.730
Mr. Foster. are you seeing
this?

1522
01:58:37.467 --> 01:58:38.401
Yes!

1523
01:58:38.435 --> 01:58:39.670
Come on. fucking kick its ass!

1524
01:58:39.704 --> 01:58:41.404
Wendy. come on. come
on!

1525
01:58:41.438 --> 01:58:42.707
Wendy. we have to go!

1526
01:58:42.740 --> 01:58:43.875
Wendy. please!

1527
01:58:45.877 --> 01:58:46.778
I can't leave him.

1528
01:58:50.948 --> 01:58:51.783
Come on.

1529
01:58:59.123 --> 01:59:00.091
Get against the wall.

1530
01:59:09.432 --> 01:59:10.433
Fucking great.

1531
01:59:11.936 --> 01:59:12.569
You gotta go.

1532
01:59:12.602 --> 01:59:13.871
You leave me here. just go.

1533
01:59:18.508 --> 01:59:19.342
You go. sorry.

1534
01:59:19.376 --> 01:59:20.044
Take him. now!

1535
01:59:20.077 --> 01:59:21.511
Go. you gotta go!

1536
01:59:35.592 --> 01:59:36.894
Kill it. just kill it.

1537
01:59:57.114 --> 01:59:58.149
You guys go.

1538
01:59:58.182 --> 02:00:01.085
No. no. there's way too
much hero shit going on.

1539
02:00:01.118 --> 02:00:02.720
We're fucked.

1540
02:00:02.753 --> 02:00:03.754
Everyone.

1541
02:00:06.958 --> 02:00:07.624
Leap.

1542
02:00:07.658 --> 02:00:09.392
We gotta get the kid.

1543
02:00:09.426 --> 02:00:10.294
Leap.

1544
02:00:20.004 --> 02:00:21.471
You unlucky prick.

1545
02:00:40.624 --> 02:00:42.660
Oh. shit. Boller.

1546
02:00:56.473 --> 02:00:57.208
Fuck!

1547
02:01:25.568 --> 02:01:27.038
Come on. come on!

1548
02:01:28.072 --> 02:01:33.476
Come on. do it. fight me
like a fucking man. come on!

1549
02:01:33.510 --> 02:01:34.845
Come on. come on!

1550
02:01:35.913 --> 02:01:36.914
Come on. come on!

1551
02:01:39.150 --> 02:01:40.483
Is that what you want?

1552
02:01:42.086 --> 02:01:44.521
That's it. come on.

1553
02:02:01.706 --> 02:02:03.107
Leap. Leap. what are you doing
here?

1554
02:02:03.140 --> 02:02:04.275
Go. no. no!

1555
02:02:04.308 --> 02:02:05.710
You have to go!

1556
02:02:07.577 --> 02:02:09.113
Do me a favor and blow it now.

1557
02:02:09.146 --> 02:02:11.015
They're all there. just
get rid of all of them!

1558
02:02:11.048 --> 02:02:12.049
Underway.

1559
02:02:12.883 --> 02:02:14.285
Wait. cancel that.

1560
02:02:14.318 --> 02:02:15.286
Cancel what?

1561
02:02:15.319 --> 02:02:16.586
We have an error.

1562
02:02:16.619 --> 02:02:18.089
Come on!

1563
02:02:18.122 --> 02:02:19.824
Get up!

1564
02:02:19.857 --> 02:02:22.592
Captain Mason
Cartwright. Navy special forces.

1565
02:02:22.625 --> 02:02:24.028
Life is important.

1566
02:02:24.829 --> 02:02:27.765
- Run. run.
- Go. go. go. run. run!

1567
02:02:28.733 --> 02:02:31.802
Four just activated it
sown self-destruct protocol.

1568
02:02:31.836 --> 02:02:34.571
Leap. get down. get down.
Leap. now!

1569
02:02:53.858 --> 02:02:55.726
So what happened. did the bomb
go off?

1570
02:02:55.760 --> 02:02:58.029
Let me check the satellite
images in the area.

1571
02:03:19.350 --> 02:03:20.650
You didn't save shit.

1572
02:03:21.819 --> 02:03:22.720
Human life.

1573
02:03:22.753 --> 02:03:24.688
No. his life's more important
than mine!

1574
02:03:24.722 --> 02:03:26.157
Human life!

1575
02:03:26.190 --> 02:03:28.259
No. his life's more important
than mine.

1576
02:03:28.292 --> 02:03:29.960
Human life!

1577
02:03:29.994 --> 02:03:31.796
No. his life's more important
than mine.

1578
02:03:52.917 --> 02:03:55.953
What a complete fucking mess.

1579
02:03:55.986 --> 02:03:57.054
This deal is over.

1580
02:03:57.088 --> 02:03:59.256
I think they did quite well.

1581
02:03:59.290 --> 02:04:01.258
Three units racked up 37 kills.

1582
02:04:01.292 --> 02:04:04.028
including a highly trained
Navy SEAL and a rogue unit.

1583
02:04:04.061 --> 02:04:06.063
Not to mention. up to
eight unidentified targets

1584
02:04:06.097 --> 02:04:08.399
over three days through
unsurveyed. unmapped.

1585
02:04:08.432 --> 02:04:11.669
mine-saturated territory
with no satellite support?

1586
02:04:11.702 --> 02:04:13.771
No air support. no ground
support.

1587
02:04:13.804 --> 02:04:17.208
From my perspective. the
test was a massive success.

1588
02:04:17.241 --> 02:04:19.642
And. as for your participation.

1589
02:04:19.677 --> 02:04:22.213
everything's recorded. you're
all over it.

1590
02:04:22.246 --> 02:04:24.949
You're not getting out of any
deal.

1591
02:04:24.982 --> 02:04:26.050
Shall we finish up?

1592
02:04:39.897 --> 02:04:41.332
- Ah. shit.
- What?

1593
02:04:41.365 --> 02:04:42.933
BR4 completed its upload.

1594
02:04:42.967 --> 02:04:43.901
Where to?

1595
02:04:43.934 --> 02:04:45.069
No idea.

1596
02:04:45.102 --> 02:04:46.904
Well. we scan the server
stateside.

1597
02:04:50.407 --> 02:04:52.209
Send everything we have to the
labs now.

1598
02:04:52.243 --> 02:04:54.078
Clean up and be ready to leave
tonight.

1599
02:04:54.111 --> 02:04:55.446
Fuck yeah!

1600
02:04:55.479 --> 02:04:57.081
You've all done a great job.

1601
02:04:57.114 --> 02:04:58.115
Thank you. sir.

1602
02:04:58.149 --> 02:04:59.750
Looking forward to going home.

1603
02:05:09.860 --> 02:05:11.795
Is Jantz still there?

1604
02:05:14.932 --> 02:05:16.133
Yep. he's still here.
