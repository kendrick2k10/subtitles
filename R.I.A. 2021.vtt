I'm so looking forward

do a workout. Jack?

98
00:08:33.522 --> 00:08:35.323

lazy today. honey.

00:08:36.258 --> 00:08:37.257
But I'll watch you.

100
00:08:37.259 --> 00:08:38.093
You can teach me.

101
00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:40.961
Okay. well. it's
simple really.

102
00:08:40.963 --> 00:08:44.431
First of all we raise
to the tip of our toes

103
00:08:44.433 --> 00:08:46.266
and back down again.

104
00:08:46.268 --> 00:08:48.969
One. two. three. four.

105
00:08:48.971 --> 00:08:53.139
five. six. seven.
eight. nine. 10.

106
00:08:53.141 --> 00:08:54.074
Okay.

107
00:08:54.076 --> 00:08:55.143
Then we lay on our side

108
00:08:56.612 --> 00:08:57.611
and we lift our leg.

109
00:08:57.613 --> 00:09:01.014
One. two. three.
four. five. six-

110
00:09:01.016 --> 00:09:02.451
- That is so cute.

111
00:09:05.721 --> 00:09:06.989

112
00:09:07.823 --> 00:09:08.657

113
00:09:09.558 --> 00:09:10.857

114
00:09:10.859 --> 00:09:12.192

115
00:09:12.194 --> 00:09:13.496
You always look beautiful.

116
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:15.962
I just thought maybe

117
00:09:15.964 --> 00:09:17.500
we could do nothing
together. that's all.

118
00:09:23.305 --> 00:09:25.874
No. Jack. I must get changed.

119
00:10:27.369 --> 00:10:29.570

this new Bolognese sauce

150 calories per serving

121

00:10:37.179 --> 00:10:39.345
Would you like
mushrooms in it or not?

123
00:10:39.347 --> 00:10:41.114
I think I'll pass. honey.

124
00:10:41.116 --> 00:10:44.985
I'm not really a huge fan
of mushrooms if that's okay.

125
00:10:44.987 --> 00:10:46.889
Mushrooms it is then.

126
00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:50.125

128
00:10:59.401 --> 00:11:02.502

133
00:11:29.331 --> 00:11:30.530

136
00:11:35.671 --> 00:11:37.205
Well. I had an idea.

137
00:11:38.874 --> 00:11:40.807
I was thinking instead of you
watching your show this week

138
00:11:40.809 --> 00:11:42.042
like you do every week

139
00:11:42.044 --> 00:11:44.344
maybe we can do
something different.

140
00:11:44.346 --> 00:11:46.048
something fun just
the two of us.

141
00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:57.392
I think I'll watch
my soap after all.

142
00:12:00.896 --> 00:12:01.730
Of course.

143
00:12:23.285 --> 00:12:25.986
This washing up liquid
lasts forever and ever.

144
00:12:25.988 --> 00:12:29.089

Honey.

146
00:12:33.862 --> 00:12:36.198

the other room for you okay?

147
00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:47.741

can't keep doing this.

149
00:12:48.944 --> 00:12:50.510

what we want.

150
00:12:50.512 --> 00:12:53.579
We're hurting people.
people that we love.

151
00:12:53.581 --> 00:12:55.248
Don't you think I know that?

152
00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:57.684
Don't you think I know
I should stay away?

153
00:12:57.686 --> 00:12:58.586
I just can't.

154
00:13:00.088 --> 00:13:02.655

luckiest man alive.

155
00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:05.726

157

bear to see my child

163
00:13:17.472 --> 00:13:19.605
So what. you want
me to just leave him?

164
00:13:19.607 --> 00:13:20.874
Yes.

165
00:13:20.876 --> 00:13:21.808

that bad. you know.

166
00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.076
After all. he has put a roof

167
00:13:23.078 --> 00:13:25.245
over both of our heads.

168
00:13:25.247 --> 00:13:26.947

that's what you want.

243
00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:15.588

What would you like
with it. fries or mash?

368
00:27:06.067 --> 00:27:07.034
You decide. babe.

369
00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:10.102
Mash it is.

370
00:27:10.104 --> 00:27:11.270
Perfect.

371
00:27:11.272 --> 00:27:12.672
Want you to dress
up for dinner.

372
00:27:12.674 --> 00:27:14.740
Why don't we dress for dinner?

373
00:27:14.742 --> 00:27:15.877
Okay. I'm game.

374
00:27:23.885 --> 00:27:27.953
I have to say you really
are an amazing cook.

375
00:27:27.955 --> 00:27:31.056
And you look stunning
in that dress.

376
00:27:31.058 --> 00:27:32.692
Have one just like it.

377
00:27:32.694 --> 00:27:33.527
Thank you.

378
00:27:39.433 --> 00:27:42.434
This washing up liquid
really does last forever.

379
00:27:42.436 --> 00:27:44.336
I certainly believe
the manufacturers

380
00:27:44.338 --> 00:27:47.773
when they say it out-washes
all other competitors.

381
00:27:47.775 --> 00:27:51.376
Hey. Ria. I think you're
gonna love these drinks.

382
00:27:51.378 --> 00:27:53.112
Although I
wanna be an actress.

383
00:27:53.114 --> 00:27:55.981
I've spent most of my
career working in bars.

384
00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.222
Shaken. not stirred.

385
00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:07.793
I told you. Beth.

386
00:28:07.795 --> 00:28:11.096
I told you I wasn't gonna stand
for this bullshit no more.

387
00:28:11.098 --> 00:28:13.666
Well. you killed him!

388
00:28:13.668 --> 00:28:16.902
Why did you have to kill him?

389
00:28:16.904 --> 00:28:19.171
Because nobody makes
a fool out of Tony Mendoza

390
00:28:19.173 --> 00:28:21.240
and gets away with it.

391
00:28:21.242 --> 00:28:23.042
Not even his brother.

392
00:28:23.044 --> 00:28:24.610
But he loved you.

393
00:28:24.612 --> 00:28:26.445
He respected you.

394
00:28:26.447 --> 00:28:27.913
What?

395
00:28:27.915 --> 00:28:30.415
It was just bad
timing that we fell in love.

396
00:28:30.417 --> 00:28:31.252
No!

397
00:28:32.453 --> 00:28:34.121
Whatever that was it's done.

398
00:28:35.156 --> 00:28:36.622
Okay?

399
00:28:36.624 --> 00:28:38.758
Now shut your mouth.
clean this place up.

400
00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:40.361
and help me get rid of the body.

401
00:28:41.863 --> 00:28:43.262
What?

402
00:28:43.264 --> 00:28:44.129
I can't.

403
00:28:44.131 --> 00:28:45.330
My condition.

404
00:28:45.332 --> 00:28:46.768
Your condition?

405
00:28:48.469 --> 00:28:50.602
You were in an okay condition
just now to hump him

406
00:28:50.604 --> 00:28:52.504
in our marital bed.

407
00:28:52.506 --> 00:28:54.206
Huh?

408
00:28:54.208 --> 00:28:56.408
But you can't help me take
his body out to the car?

409
00:28:57.645 --> 00:28:58.811
No. you'll do it.

410
00:28:58.813 --> 00:29:00.545
And you'll be happy
about the fact

411
00:29:00.547 --> 00:29:01.947

436
00:34:14.228 --> 00:34:15.927
Head outside. get
into the minivan.

437
00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:17.662
I'll inform them you're
traveling and you'll pass

438
00:34:17.664 --> 00:34:18.930
the next husband en route.

439
00:34:18.932 --> 00:34:20.165
Okay. is that it then?

440
00:34:20.167 --> 00:34:22.734
Darling. thanks for
your involvement today.

441
00:34:22.736 --> 00:34:24.970
You were actually one of
the best we've ever had.

442
00:34:24.972 --> 00:34:25.772
I thank you.

443
00:34:28.175 --> 00:34:29.574
Foxtrot four. the house is green

444
00:34:29.576 --> 00:34:31.510
and we are ready to go.

445
00:34:31.512 --> 00:34:33.612
Thank
you. indigo foxtrot three.

446
00:34:33.614 --> 00:34:38.517
J1201 is traveling and you are
clear to leave when complete.

447
00:34:38.519 --> 00:34:39.784
Really?

448
00:34:39.786 --> 00:34:41.320
Do you have to tell
them that bullshit?

449
00:34:41.322 --> 00:34:43.188
What. that she's the
best we've ever had?

450
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:44.789
Come on. she was.

451
00:34:44.791 --> 00:34:45.692
Yeah. right.

452
00:34:50.697 --> 00:34:51.532
We're good to go.

453
00:34:54.468 --> 00:34:55.500
Come
in. Jack. come and get-

454
00:34:55.502 --> 00:34:56.301
- Hey. wait!

455
00:34:56.303 --> 00:34:57.236
Is this it?

456
00:34:57.238 --> 00:34:58.970
What do you mean "is this it"?

457
00:34:58.972 --> 00:35:01.473
I don't mean to
be rude but so far

458
00:35:01.475 --> 00:35:03.842
this whole experience
is not what I expected.

459
00:35:03.844 --> 00:35:06.045
I won the grand prize.

460
00:35:06.047 --> 00:35:07.512
I don't get what
you mean. mate.

461
00:35:07.514 --> 00:35:08.947
I was driven all
the way out here

462
00:35:08.949 --> 00:35:11.950
by that rude son of a
bitch who you call a driver

463
00:35:11.952 --> 00:35:14.386
and he didn't give
me any instructions

464
00:35:14.388 --> 00:35:15.320
on what I was supposed
to do tonight.

465
00:35:15.322 --> 00:35:16.688
I know. it's okay. sir.

466
00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:18.223
- All you need to do-
- Oh. come on.

467
00:35:18.225 --> 00:35:20.859
is get into bed. get some
sleep. and in the morning

468
00:35:20.861 --> 00:35:22.561
everything will be clear.

469
00:35:22.563 --> 00:35:24.198
I don't
know about that.

470
00:35:44.118 --> 00:35:45.350
Good morning!

471
00:35:45.352 --> 00:35:47.819
It is Monday. the
19th of March. 2040

472
00:35:47.821 --> 00:35:50.789
and we have two
very special guests.

473
00:35:50.791 --> 00:35:53.525
Mitchell Lawrence and
Robert Stewart-Oaten

474
00:35:53.527 --> 00:35:56.395
creators and respective
producer and director

475
00:35:56.397 --> 00:35:58.397
of "A Day with Ria".

476
00:35:58.399 --> 00:35:59.664
Good morning.

477
00:35:59.666 --> 00:36:00.465
Morning.

478
00:36:00.467 --> 00:36:01.233
Thanks for having us.

479
00:36:01.235 --> 00:36:02.434
No worries.

480
00:36:02.436 --> 00:36:05.070
So it's been four
years and five series

481
00:36:05.072 --> 00:36:08.740
and the show just keeps
getting better and better.

482
00:36:08.742 --> 00:36:11.076
Mitchell. tell me.
what is the secret?

483
00:36:11.078 --> 00:36:13.645
Well. it's actually quite
hard for me to answer.

484
00:36:14.748 --> 00:36:16.548
It's the guest stars we have

485
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:18.217
and the scenarios we put them in

486
00:36:18.219 --> 00:36:21.486
that makes it very
watchable and unique.

487
00:36:21.488 --> 00:36:23.755
Now. Robert. you
have won countless awards

488
00:36:23.757 --> 00:36:26.458
for your directorial
style during the show.

489
00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:28.760
But. at the same time.
you've been criticized

490
00:36:28.762 --> 00:36:32.631
for creating a show that
some say runs itself.

491
00:36:32.633 --> 00:36:35.600
True. but what most
people fail to understand

492
00:36:35.602 --> 00:36:38.137
is the complexity and
ever-changing nature

493
00:36:38.139 --> 00:36:39.304
of an unscripted show.

494
00:36:39.306 --> 00:36:41.773
I mean sure. Ria
follows her own script

495
00:36:41.775 --> 00:36:44.909
but the contestants or
husbands. if you like.

496
00:36:44.911 --> 00:36:47.646
I mean. we never know
what they're going to do.

497
00:36:47.648 --> 00:36:49.481
Yes. of course.

498
00:36:49.483 --> 00:36:52.251
So how on Earth do you
keep track of everything

499
00:36:52.253 --> 00:36:53.652
that goes on in that house?

500
00:36:53.654 --> 00:36:55.387
With a lot of skill and aided

501
00:36:55.389 --> 00:36:57.489
by the most
up-to-date technology.

502
00:36:57.491 --> 00:37:01.160
We have about 250 cameras
planted all over the house

503
00:37:01.162 --> 00:37:04.229
some as high def
and precise as this.

504
00:37:04.231 --> 00:37:06.898
- Oh!
- And others as small

505
00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:09.468
and discrete as this.

506
00:37:10.637 --> 00:37:12.237
This little camera

507
00:37:12.239 --> 00:37:16.941
is 8K in quality and my
absolute favorite to shoot with.

508
00:37:16.943 --> 00:37:19.878
The others are so big and
obtrusive that the husbands

509
00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.380
always know they're on.

510
00:37:21.382 --> 00:37:25.116
Whereas those little babies.
so small and unobtrusive.

511
00:37:25.118 --> 00:37:27.486
you get to the real
soul of a contributor.

512
00:37:27.488 --> 00:37:29.821
Come on. you're not
into "Ria" are ya?

513
00:37:29.823 --> 00:37:30.655
Shh.

514
00:37:30.657 --> 00:37:31.856
I love it.

515
00:37:31.858 --> 00:37:33.158
It's my one and only
guilty pleasure.

516
00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:34.393
The only one?

517
00:37:34.395 --> 00:37:35.296
Well.

518
00:37:36.663 --> 00:37:39.766
Hey. Jess. I was
wondering if...

519
00:37:41.134 --> 00:37:43.034
Sorry. John. you were saying.

520
00:37:45.939 --> 00:37:48.907
Vice President Flemming is
also a fan of "A Day with Ria".

521
00:37:48.909 --> 00:37:51.543
As Vice President Chief
of Staff. you know full well

522
00:37:51.545 --> 00:37:53.347
I couldn't possibly
comment on that.

523
00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:57.015
Now the audience
are in control.

524
00:37:57.017 --> 00:37:59.718
voting over everything
that happens in the house

525
00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:02.354
from what Ria wears that
day to what they both eat.

526
00:38:02.356 --> 00:38:04.856
In fact. every time
there is a question

527
00:38:04.858 --> 00:38:07.426
or a decision
posed in the house.

528
00:38:07.428 --> 00:38:11.530
Ria and the audience are
integral to the process.

529
00:38:11.532 --> 00:38:14.966
So now we have a little
VT that viewers have RIAPPed

530
00:38:14.968 --> 00:38:17.869
most popular contributor
of the series.

531
00:38:21.708 --> 00:38:22.641
Okay. stop the car.

532
00:38:22.643 --> 00:38:23.908
Okay. so I washed the dishes.

533
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:25.143
I vacuumed. and then I
dusted the whole house

534
00:38:25.145 --> 00:38:27.045
all whilst wearing
this ridiculous outfit.

535
00:38:27.848 --> 00:38:29.281
Congratulations. Jack.

536
00:38:29.283 --> 00:38:31.115
You have won the right to
request anything you like of me.

537
00:38:31.117 --> 00:38:33.352
Uh. uh. I would like
to sing you a song. Ria.

538
00:38:33.354 --> 00:38:34.255
if that's okay.

539
00:38:35.389 --> 00:38:37.522
Your request
has been accepted.

540
00:38:37.524 --> 00:38:38.859
Okay. boys. hit it.

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:01.340
on the show this
year. that's for sure.

578
00:40:01.342 --> 00:40:02.841
Absolutely.

579
00:40:02.843 --> 00:40:06.978
By the way. I am obsessed with
the 1950s theme this series.

580
00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:09.614
The attention to
detail is just amazing.

581
00:40:09.616 --> 00:40:11.883
So now I have to ask.

582
00:40:11.885 --> 00:40:14.252
do you think I'd look
good in a Ria dress?

583
00:40:14.254 --> 00:40:17.456
Erika. you would look
good in just about anything.

584
00:40:17.458 --> 00:40:19.458
Oh. stop it. you.

585
00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:21.192
Well.
the details are-

586
00:40:21.194 --> 00:40:23.428
- Nothing on. audiences
love about the show.

587
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:26.731
Oh. in fact I can exclusively
reveal that next season.

588
00:40:26.733 --> 00:40:27.566
we're gonna be doing something

589
00:40:27.568 --> 00:40:29.334
a little different.

590
00:40:29.336 --> 00:40:31.636
Every day Ria spends
with a husband

591
00:40:31.638 --> 00:40:33.638
will be Christmas Day.

592
00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:35.874
It should
be a lotta fun.

593
00:40:35.876 --> 00:40:39.478
Yeah. definitely for the
viewer and even the husband.

594
00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:41.946
But what about Ria?

595
00:40:43.684 --> 00:40:45.183
What about her?

596
00:40:45.185 --> 00:40:47.185
Well. again. in the past
you've been criticized

597
00:40:47.187 --> 00:40:50.989
with. well. with people
calling the show inhumane.

598
00:40:58.399 --> 00:40:59.831
Good one.

599
00:40:59.833 --> 00:41:02.333
I'm not even gonna
dignify that with an answer.

600
00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:06.671
Well. Robert and
Mitchell. thank you so much

601
00:41:06.673 --> 00:41:08.239
for coming in this morning.

602
00:41:08.241 --> 00:41:10.174
And for fans of
"A Day with Ria".

603
00:41:10.176 --> 00:41:13.011

episode in 30 minutes

00:41:13.013 --> 00:41:14.946
right here on Channel Six.

605
00:41:29.162 --> 00:41:30.361
Good
morning. viewers.

606
00:41:30.363 --> 00:41:32.296
It's 7:03 a.m.

607
00:41:32.298 --> 00:41:34.535
Ria wakes up to a new day.

608
00:41:36.336 --> 00:41:39.806
It's now time for you to have
your first choice of the day.

609
00:41:40.707 --> 00:41:42.674
Please use the RIAPP to choose

610

the Scarlet Fever or
the Cinderella lipstick

from Fab Cosmetics.

612
00:41:48.048 --> 00:41:49.514
Good morning. world.

613
00:41:49.516 --> 00:41:51.483
What fun-filled adventures
do you have in store

614
00:41:51.485 --> 00:41:53.017
for me today?

615
00:41:53.019 --> 00:41:55.053
You can also
suggest the daily chores

616
00:41:55.055 --> 00:41:56.056
through the app. too.

617
00:42:00.994 --> 00:42:04.463
Ria. now back in the bedroom.
is ready to get dressed.

618
00:42:04.465 --> 00:42:06.565
By the way. ladies.
if you like anything

619
00:42:06.567 --> 00:42:09.668
Ria is wearing from
underwear to outerwear.

620
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:12.170
remember. you can find
the details of the items

621
00:42:12.172 --> 00:42:13.574
on our website.

622
00:42:42.569 --> 00:42:43.502
You okay. Mitch?

623
00:42:43.504 --> 00:42:44.302
You haven't said much tonight.

624
00:42:44.304 --> 00:42:45.103
Yeah. I'm fine.

625
00:42:45.105 --> 00:42:46.337
I'm just goddamn pissed

626
00:42:46.339 --> 00:42:47.639
at that presenter
bitch this morning.

627
00:42:47.641 --> 00:42:49.841
And I know there
will always be idiots

628
00:42:49.843 --> 00:42:51.643
protesting against Ria.

629
00:42:51.645 --> 00:42:53.444
True. but I kinda
got used to it.

630
00:42:53.446 --> 00:42:54.846
I just thought you had.

631
00:42:54.848 --> 00:42:56.114
Of course I have.

632
00:42:56.116 --> 00:42:57.081
But the producers of
"The Morning Show"

633
00:42:57.083 --> 00:42:58.650
promised me an easier ride.

634
00:42:58.652 --> 00:43:00.785
Well. as long as it doesn't
decrease our viewing figures.

635
00:43:00.787 --> 00:43:03.054
You
gotta be kidding.

636
00:43:03.056 --> 00:43:06.727
No. actually. the more
controversy the better.

637
00:43:08.228 --> 00:43:09.963
Thank you for
reminding me of that.

638
00:43:11.498 --> 00:43:15.867
That bitch this
morning helped us out after all.

639
00:43:17.103 --> 00:43:19.838
I bet you those idiots
screaming "free Ria"

640
00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:22.907
watch her every minute
of every goddamn day

641
00:43:22.909 --> 00:43:24.408
and obsess over it.

642
00:43:25.579 --> 00:43:26.511
They're hypocrites.

643
00:43:26.513 --> 00:43:27.779
Hmm.

644
00:43:27.781 --> 00:43:29.013
You're right.

645
00:43:29.015 --> 00:43:30.849
Of course I am.

646
00:43:30.851 --> 00:43:32.152
Hey. trust me on this one.

647
00:43:33.453 --> 00:43:35.386
The more drama we bring.

648
00:43:35.388 --> 00:43:37.188
the more people
will be against it

649
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:40.424
and the more people
will watch it

650
00:43:40.426 --> 00:43:42.195
and will love it.

651
00:44:25.538 --> 00:44:27.572
So you excited about tomorrow?

652
00:44:27.574 --> 00:44:29.007
Of course.

653
00:44:29.009 --> 00:44:30.341
It's been a long time coming.

654
00:44:30.343 --> 00:44:31.309
Awesome. man.

655
00:44:31.311 --> 00:44:32.777
Got anything special planned

656
00:44:32.779 --> 00:44:34.746
or are you just gonna
improvise the whole thing?

657
00:44:34.748 --> 00:44:36.981
Well. they did suggest
to have a party piece

658
00:44:36.983 --> 00:44:39.720
but I think I'm
just gonna wing it.

659
00:45:00.607 --> 00:45:01.541
Come on in.

660
00:45:03.243 --> 00:45:05.644
Mr. Vice President.
I have some files here

661
00:45:05.646 --> 00:45:06.845
that need your attention.

662
00:45:06.847 --> 00:45:08.346
Great.

663
00:45:08.348 --> 00:45:10.717
There's also an email
that is addressed to you.

664
00:45:11.685 --> 00:45:12.617
What does it say?

665
00:45:12.619 --> 00:45:14.185
Honestly I don't know. sir.

666
00:45:14.187 --> 00:45:16.454
For one. it's locked under
your personal security code

667
00:45:16.456 --> 00:45:18.556
and when we looked
into the IP address.

668
00:45:18.558 --> 00:45:21.325
it flagged up as probably
coming from your son.

669
00:45:21.327 --> 00:45:22.696
We felt it must be private.

670
00:45:25.065 --> 00:45:26.698
All right.

671
00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:28.466
Well. thank you. Jess.

672
00:45:28.468 --> 00:45:30.068
That'll be all for tonight.

673
00:45:30.070 --> 00:45:31.171
Have a good evening.

674
00:45:42.482 --> 00:45:43.848
- Hey. what the-
- Oh my gosh!

675
00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:44.783
Look at that.

676
00:45:44.785 --> 00:45:46.184
You have to watch it.

677
00:45:48.889 --> 00:45:49.888
Hey!

678
00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:51.289
Hey. what are we
doing here. huh?

679
00:45:51.291 --> 00:45:52.323
Just having fun?

680
00:45:52.325 --> 00:45:53.692
Hey. I'm sorry. sir.

681
00:45:53.694 --> 00:45:55.295
- I didn't mean it.
- Oh my God.

682
00:45:56.129 --> 00:45:58.965
No. no.

683
00:46:02.202 --> 00:46:04.969
Right. the next one
will have to be a hit

684
00:46:04.971 --> 00:46:07.271
and elevate our figures
through the roof.

685
00:46:07.273 --> 00:46:08.840
I want drama. I want scandal.

686
00:46:08.842 --> 00:46:13.011
I want viewers on the edges
of their fucking seats!

687
00:46:13.013 --> 00:46:15.446
Well. you're gonna
love this guy then.

688
00:46:15.448 --> 00:46:16.848
The background checks came back

689
00:46:16.850 --> 00:46:19.617
with something fairly
interesting about him.

690
00:46:19.619 --> 00:46:20.584
Oh really?

691
00:46:20.586 --> 00:46:21.853
Like what?

692
00:46:21.855 --> 00:46:23.722
He gave us a false identity.

693
00:46:23.724 --> 00:46:26.126
He told us his name
was Jason Sampson.

694
00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:32.098
Okay. but why and who is
he and should I be worried?

695
00:46:32.833 --> 00:46:33.433
I don't think so.

696
00:46:34.534 --> 00:46:36.467
His real name is Flemming.

697
00:46:36.469 --> 00:46:38.502
I don't understand.

698
00:46:38.504 --> 00:46:40.306
Robert shouting.
"Geez he's a pig."

699
00:46:42.142 --> 00:46:43.407
You don't mean he's related

700
00:46:43.409 --> 00:46:45.676
to Vice President
Joseph Flemming?

701
00:46:45.678 --> 00:46:46.778
Yeah.

702
00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:47.613
It's his son.

703
00:46:49.549 --> 00:46:53.451
Shit.

704
00:46:53.453 --> 00:46:54.287
Exactly.

705
00:46:55.188 --> 00:46:56.320
Hey. where is he?

706
00:46:56.322 --> 00:46:57.688
I wanna speak to him.

707
00:46:57.690 --> 00:46:59.223
Well. he just left in the car.

708
00:46:59.225 --> 00:47:01.926
Okay. well. let's get him
on the phone then shall we?

709
00:47:01.928 --> 00:47:05.463
I was
there for three hours.

710
00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:08.066
That'll be for you. Jack.

711
00:47:08.068 --> 00:47:10.468
It's always for the main
contributor of the day.

712
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:11.702
Hello and welcome.

713
00:47:11.704 --> 00:47:13.237
I'm Robert. the show's director.

714
00:47:13.239 --> 00:47:15.473
And this is Mitchell.
the producer.

715
00:47:15.475 --> 00:47:16.741
Hi. I'm-

716
00:47:16.743 --> 00:47:17.942
- Jack.

717
00:47:17.944 --> 00:47:19.443
And yes. we know
who you are really.

718
00:47:19.445 --> 00:47:22.146
But that doesn't change
the fact that from now on

719
00:47:22.148 --> 00:47:25.149
you're Jack so you
better get used to it.

720
00:47:25.151 --> 00:47:26.985
Oh. yeah. sure.

721
00:47:26.987 --> 00:47:28.853
Few things before
we take you in.

722
00:47:28.855 --> 00:47:31.890
You probably know them
but the rules are simple.

723
00:47:31.892 --> 00:47:33.657
No tech is allowed.

724
00:47:33.659 --> 00:47:36.460
No phones. no IPAs. no headsets.

725
00:47:36.462 --> 00:47:39.663
no computer bracelets.
absolutely nothing.

726
00:47:39.665 --> 00:47:42.366
All phones and TV in
the house are fake.

727
00:47:42.368 --> 00:47:43.667
Don't reveal the truth to her.

728
00:47:43.669 --> 00:47:45.738
Spoils the illusion
for everybody else.

729
00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:52.076
No swearing. sex. or violence
before 9:00 p.m. at all.

730
00:47:52.078 --> 00:47:53.577
It just won't be broadcast.

731
00:47:53.579 --> 00:47:55.780
Now. go in there
and give us something new.

732
00:47:55.782 --> 00:47:57.481
something we
haven't seen before.

733
00:47:57.483 --> 00:48:00.785
something that will make
you a star of the season.

734
00:48:00.787 --> 00:48:03.521
Or even of the entire
history of "A Day with Ria".

735
00:48:03.523 --> 00:48:06.192
Push the boundaries.
make it a party.

736
00:48:07.327 --> 00:48:09.360
Get out from under
your father's shadow.

737
00:48:09.362 --> 00:48:10.594
Imagine you come
outta the show

738
00:48:10.596 --> 00:48:14.165
and the whole world cheers.

739
00:48:14.167 --> 00:48:15.266
They wanna party with you.

740
00:48:15.268 --> 00:48:18.071
It's your show. not hers.

741
00:48:19.505 --> 00:48:20.704
The cleaning
crew in the car with you

742
00:48:20.706 --> 00:48:24.508
will erase all memories
of the last Jack.

743
00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:26.110
You got a clean start.

744
00:48:26.112 --> 00:48:26.947
Go hit it. son.

745
00:48:27.914 --> 00:48:29.580
I certainly will.

746
00:48:29.582 --> 00:48:30.650
Hmm. that's the spirit.

747
00:48:32.052 --> 00:48:35.954
Okay one last form
for you to fingerprint

748
00:48:35.956 --> 00:48:38.358
then we'll take you into
the secret location.

749
00:48:39.559 --> 00:48:42.360
Ria and Jack's house.

750
00:48:46.967 --> 00:48:47.798
One last thing.

751
00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:49.467
What about my list?

752
00:48:49.469 --> 00:48:52.003
Your list of requirements.
likes. dislikes.

753
00:48:52.005 --> 00:48:54.839
food. sexual preferences.

754
00:48:54.841 --> 00:48:56.875
they're all taken care of.

755
00:48:56.877 --> 00:48:59.643
Now go in there. son.
and give us a good show.

756
00:48:59.645 --> 00:49:00.746
We'll be watching.

757
00:49:04.184 --> 00:49:05.018
Thank you.

758
00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:08.719
Oh. I have got a good
feeling about this one.

759
00:49:08.721 --> 00:49:12.156
Now. how do we play the press?

760
00:49:12.158 --> 00:49:15.261
We gotta let them know
the VP's son in our house

761
00:49:16.129 --> 00:49:17.597
without letting them know.

762
00:49:18.965 --> 00:49:20.066
It's better rank 'cause
we won't cover some 33821.

763
00:49:21.634 --> 00:49:22.735
Who's your dad?

764
00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:26.907
Um. no one really.

765
00:49:35.015 --> 00:49:36.814
You okay down there?

766
00:49:36.816 --> 00:49:40.251
Oh. yeah. just
little bit of cramp.

767
00:49:40.253 --> 00:49:42.222
Happens in the car sometimes.

768
00:49:57.203 --> 00:49:58.402
Sir?

769
00:49:58.404 --> 00:49:59.670
Good. Jess. you
haven't gone home yet.

770
00:49:59.672 --> 00:50:00.939
Can you come back to
the office please?

771
00:50:00.941 --> 00:50:01.774
Course. sir.

772
00:50:02.675 --> 00:50:04.042
Is that John?

773
00:50:04.044 --> 00:50:04.909
Bring him along as well.

774
00:50:04.911 --> 00:50:06.010
Okay.

775
00:50:06.012 --> 00:50:06.846
John!

776
00:50:11.017 --> 00:50:14.454
And we have arrived
at the destination.

777
00:50:16.222 --> 00:50:17.057
Oh my God!

778
00:50:17.924 --> 00:50:19.490
It reads like a goodbye letter.

779
00:50:19.492 --> 00:50:20.826
What are you gonna do. sir?

780
00:50:22.028 --> 00:50:22.862
I don't know.

781
00:50:24.897 --> 00:50:27.798
What do you know about this
show. "A Day with Ria"?

782
00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:30.168
Only that it's the most
popular piece of entertainment

783
00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:31.902
on the planet.

784
00:50:31.904 --> 00:50:34.707
When was the last time
you saw your son. sir?

785
00:50:36.842 --> 00:50:38.044
It's been a while.

786
00:50:39.712 --> 00:50:42.213
Look. the only thing I'm really
concerned about right now

787
00:50:42.215 --> 00:50:44.015
is protecting this
administration

788
00:50:44.017 --> 00:50:45.685
and keeping this quiet.

789
00:50:46.852 --> 00:50:48.819
I assume he's gonna
be on tomorrow?

790
00:50:48.821 --> 00:50:50.554
Judging by this letter yes.

791
00:50:50.556 --> 00:50:52.823
But I don't think we
should rush in too hard.

792
00:50:52.825 --> 00:50:54.125
Why not?

793
00:50:54.127 --> 00:50:55.726
The show never reveals
a contestant's identity

794
00:50:55.728 --> 00:50:58.329
so why not see how
this plays out?

795
00:50:58.331 --> 00:51:00.631
Don't think he's planning
anything drastic.

796
00:51:00.633 --> 00:51:02.666
Certainly this letter doesn't
prove this is gonna be

797
00:51:02.668 --> 00:51:05.103
a problem for you
or the president.

798
00:51:05.105 --> 00:51:06.704
I agree. sir.

799
00:51:06.706 --> 00:51:08.572
Besides. the production
company may not even know

800
00:51:08.574 --> 00:51:10.108
he's your son.

801
00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:11.942
And if they get the slightest
hint there's something wrong.

802
00:51:11.944 --> 00:51:14.678
then if anything. our
action rather than inaction

803
00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:15.748
may go against us.

804
00:51:19.219 --> 00:51:22.186
I don't like it but fine.

805
00:51:22.188 --> 00:51:25.423
But this stays right here
between the three of us.

806
00:51:25.425 --> 00:51:27.791
There's no reason for the
president to be alerted

807
00:51:27.793 --> 00:51:28.961
about this. not yet.

808
00:51:32.232 --> 00:51:33.333
That's all. thank you.

809
00:51:41.607 --> 00:51:42.575
Good night. Ria.

810
00:52:23.183 --> 00:52:24.648
Good
morning. everyone.

811
00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:26.150
The time is 7:03

812
00:52:26.152 --> 00:52:27.385
and our gorgeous Ria

813
00:52:27.387 --> 00:52:29.353
is waking up to a fresh day.

814
00:52:29.355 --> 00:52:30.721
Isn't she beautiful?

815
00:52:30.723 --> 00:52:31.955
Get ready. viewers.

816
00:52:31.957 --> 00:52:34.358
It's now time for your
first choice of the day.

817
00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:35.559
Make it a good one.

818
00:52:35.561 --> 00:52:37.961
Use the RIAPP to
choose the Red Devil

819
00:52:37.963 --> 00:52:40.431
or the Purple Rose lipstick

820
00:52:40.433 --> 00:52:43.067
from our friends
at Fab Cosmetics.

821
00:52:43.069 --> 00:52:44.502
Good morning. world.

822
00:52:44.504 --> 00:52:46.437
What fun-filled adventures
do you have in store

823
00:52:46.439 --> 00:52:48.772
- for me today?
- Just you wait and see.

824
00:52:48.774 --> 00:52:50.841
Don't forget. viewers.
you can also suggest

825
00:52:50.843 --> 00:52:52.845
the daily chores
through the app as well.

826
00:53:00.386 --> 00:53:01.919
Come on. sleepy head.

827
00:53:01.921 --> 00:53:03.154
Wakey. wakey.

828
00:53:03.156 --> 00:53:04.957
We've got a whole day of
fun to get started on.

829
00:53:06.792 --> 00:53:08.194
Ah. tea.

830
00:53:09.629 --> 00:53:10.463
Lovely.

831
00:53:11.897 --> 00:53:13.664
Now you have your tea and
I'll get breakfast ready.

832
00:53:13.666 --> 00:53:16.136
What would you like. full
English or continental?

833
00:53:19.505 --> 00:53:21.004
Wait.

834
00:53:21.006 --> 00:53:21.939
Hey. what's happened?

835
00:53:28.314 --> 00:53:29.313
What the fuck just happened?

836
00:53:29.315 --> 00:53:30.681
We lost the signal!

837
00:53:30.683 --> 00:53:32.550
I can see that. jackass!

838
00:53:32.552 --> 00:53:35.119
We have never in the
history of the show

839
00:53:35.121 --> 00:53:36.454
- lost a fucking signal!
- Hustle!

840
00:53:36.456 --> 00:53:37.621
- There's no NI.
- What do you mean

841
00:53:37.623 --> 00:53:39.089
we lost the goddamn signal?

842
00:53:39.091 --> 00:53:40.324
Let me see.

843
00:53:40.326 --> 00:53:41.792
Okay. we're
trying. we're trying.

844
00:53:41.794 --> 00:53:43.127
- We're trying everything-
- Are we still on air?

845
00:53:43.129 --> 00:53:47.565
- Oh goddamn it!
- We're trying. we're trying!

846
00:53:47.567 --> 00:53:50.868
What do you mean you
don't fucking know?

847
00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:52.035
Read my lips.

848
00:53:52.037 --> 00:53:54.805
Are we still on air?

849
00:53:54.807 --> 00:53:56.006
I don't know.

850
00:53:56.008 --> 00:53:57.074
Listen.
I'm trying. listen

851
00:53:59.111 --> 00:54:00.378
We have everything
off with no explanation.

852
00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:03.314
Thank God we hadn't
gone to the press yet.

853
00:54:03.316 --> 00:54:05.082
- The color bars are off air-
- Huh. yeah.

854
00:54:05.084 --> 00:54:08.552
You're just gonna
end up back directing

855
00:54:08.554 --> 00:54:11.324
shitty little
commercials and all that.

856
00:54:12.492 --> 00:54:13.724
That's it. commercial.

857
00:54:13.726 --> 00:54:15.226
Hey. play a commercial.

858
00:54:15.228 --> 00:54:17.595
Now. playing the
washing lotion commercial.

859
00:54:17.597 --> 00:54:18.562
I didn't allow
myself to hear it.

860
00:54:18.564 --> 00:54:19.797
20 seconds left.

861
00:54:19.799 --> 00:54:21.765
Cuing the garden splash stock.

862
00:54:21.767 --> 00:54:23.801
In the next five minutes.

863
00:54:23.803 --> 00:54:24.735
Oh shit.

864
00:54:24.737 --> 00:54:27.271
I want the TV show to air.

865
00:54:27.273 --> 00:54:30.741
answers to what just
fucking happened.

866
00:54:30.743 --> 00:54:33.311
- Three-
- And an extra hot cappuccino.

867
00:54:33.313 --> 00:54:34.512
- Two. one.
- I'll have one. too.

868
00:54:34.514 --> 00:54:36.347
Get
this guy a coffee.

869
00:54:36.349 --> 00:54:37.183
Now!

870
00:54:40.786 --> 00:54:41.619
You know what?

871
00:54:41.621 --> 00:54:42.886
It's off the air.

872
00:54:42.888 --> 00:54:44.355
I don't know how and
I don't know if this

873
00:54:44.357 --> 00:54:46.857
was part of your son's plan
but it's completely off the air

874
00:54:46.859 --> 00:54:49.293
and replaying old
"Ria" commercials.

875
00:54:49.295 --> 00:54:50.594
Okay. so?

876
00:54:50.596 --> 00:54:52.162
This has to be good news. sir.

877
00:54:52.164 --> 00:54:54.232
Perhaps the production
company found out who he was

878
00:54:54.234 --> 00:54:56.567
and pulled the plug
rather than give him

879
00:54:56.569 --> 00:54:58.236
- a political platform.
- Only a hundred calories

880
00:54:58.238 --> 00:55:00.003
a serving and $3 a jar.

881
00:55:00.005 --> 00:55:01.805
My son's a fucking idiot.

882
00:55:01.807 --> 00:55:02.640
This washing up liquid

883
00:55:02.642 --> 00:55:03.841
lasts forever and ever!

884
00:55:03.843 --> 00:55:05.776
But it is off the air?

885
00:55:05.778 --> 00:55:09.282
We need to make sure
it stays off the air.

886
00:55:10.483 --> 00:55:14.852
Fuck.

887
00:55:14.854 --> 00:55:18.088
Ria. it's okay really.

888
00:55:18.090 --> 00:55:20.991
I don't think anyone can see us.

889
00:55:20.993 --> 00:55:22.528
He told me he'd be here by now.

890
00:55:24.129 --> 00:55:25.263
What do you have
planned today. Jack.

891
00:55:25.265 --> 00:55:27.164
because I have chores.

892
00:55:27.166 --> 00:55:30.234
You don't understand
what's going on here. do you?

893
00:55:30.236 --> 00:55:32.472
You don't have to follow
your script anymore.

894
00:55:33.939 --> 00:55:36.742
Okay. look. let me explain.

895
00:55:38.110 --> 00:55:40.680
I was paid a lot of money
to disrupt the show.

896
00:55:41.647 --> 00:55:43.146
I don't know how long we've got

897
00:55:43.148 --> 00:55:46.517
before anybody gets here
but I have done everything

898
00:55:46.519 --> 00:55:49.587
that I was asked to
do so why do I feel

899
00:55:49.589 --> 00:55:51.955
like this isn't going to plan?

900
00:55:51.957 --> 00:55:54.627
Are you one of those
free-reared do-gooders. Jack?

901
00:55:58.331 --> 00:56:00.163
Maybe I don't want to be saved.

902
00:56:00.165 --> 00:56:02.199
So eat your breakfast. Jack.

903
00:56:02.201 --> 00:56:03.033
It's getting cold.

904
00:56:03.035 --> 00:56:04.535
Ria. stop.

905
00:56:04.537 --> 00:56:05.903
Let me call him.

906
00:56:05.905 --> 00:56:07.838
He can explain better.

907
00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:09.709
If that's what you
think is best. Jack.

908
00:56:23.923 --> 00:56:25.423
Why are you calling me?

909
00:56:25.425 --> 00:56:27.925
Because she doesn't
understand what's going on.

910
00:56:27.927 --> 00:56:30.162
She's acting like we're
still being filmed.

911
00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:33.130
Trust that I have a plan.

912
00:56:34.233 --> 00:56:35.435
And don't call me again.

913
00:56:39.472 --> 00:56:40.971
You know what?

914
00:56:40.973 --> 00:56:42.473
These secateurs were a great
buy from the Garden Depot.

915
00:56:42.475 --> 00:56:44.708
- It's Ben isn't it?
- Are coming back online now.

916
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:47.511
We should have the picture
of the two up to 250-

917
00:56:47.513 --> 00:56:48.746
- Can you play back the moment

918
00:56:48.748 --> 00:56:51.682
when Ria brings Jack
his morning drink?

919
00:56:51.684 --> 00:56:53.719
The moment just before
we lost the image.

920
00:56:56.522 --> 00:56:57.621
There. see it?

921
00:56:57.623 --> 00:56:58.658
Zoom in on that.

922
00:57:02.161 --> 00:57:03.461
Camera 45 is offline.

923
00:57:03.463 --> 00:57:05.295
What the hell?

924
00:57:05.297 --> 00:57:06.930
Over the angles.

925
00:57:06.932 --> 00:57:07.865
There's a better angle-

926
00:57:07.867 --> 00:57:08.999
- Yep. yep.

927
00:57:09.001 --> 00:57:11.735
I understand. Director.
and I assure you

928
00:57:11.737 --> 00:57:14.538
the Vice President will
be eternally grateful.

929
00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:15.706
Of course. madam.

930
00:57:15.708 --> 00:57:17.508
I'll pass you over now.

931
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:19.144
Sir. your wife
would like a word.

932
00:57:24.016 --> 00:57:25.248
Hi.

933
00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:26.318
Yeah. I'm...

934
00:57:28.087 --> 00:57:29.689
Yeah. yes. of course
I've been watching.

935
00:57:31.323 --> 00:57:33.058
Honey. would you
calm down please?

936
00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:37.697
Believe me. I have
everything under control.

937
00:57:39.198 --> 00:57:40.032
Yeah. I know.

938
00:57:41.601 --> 00:57:42.435
Honey. honey.

939
00:57:43.969 --> 00:57:45.102
Do you believe in me?

940
00:57:45.104 --> 00:57:46.537
Do you believe I'll get it done?

941
00:57:46.539 --> 00:57:47.771
- That doesn't sound good.
- I'll get it done.

942
00:57:47.773 --> 00:57:49.239
I know you're worried.

943
00:57:49.241 --> 00:57:50.173
Well. what do you expect?

944
00:57:50.175 --> 00:57:51.509
How did it go with the FBI?

945
00:57:51.511 --> 00:57:53.611
- It was difficult.
- I don't think

946
00:57:53.613 --> 00:57:55.012
it's a real thing.

947
00:57:55.014 --> 00:57:55.946
Because I
couldn't tell him we knew

948
00:57:55.948 --> 00:57:57.815
who today's husband is.

949
00:57:57.817 --> 00:57:59.249
I see.

950
00:57:59.251 --> 00:58:00.350
- It's probably some stunt.
- Better you than me.

951
00:58:00.352 --> 00:58:01.018
- Thanks.
- Publicity for this

952
00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:02.420
television show.

953
00:58:02.422 --> 00:58:04.988
Believe me. I have
it all under control.

954
00:58:54.173 --> 00:58:55.708
I knew you'd be in here next.

955
00:58:57.577 --> 00:58:59.677
And you can stick to
your script if you want.

956
00:58:59.679 --> 00:59:00.611
It's fine by me.

957
00:59:00.613 --> 00:59:02.147
All the cameras are off anyway.

958
00:59:03.048 --> 00:59:04.550
Just answer me this.

959
00:59:06.085 --> 00:59:08.185
Do you understand me now?

960
00:59:08.187 --> 00:59:09.587
Of course I do. Jack.

961
00:59:46.626 --> 00:59:50.193
Time for a quick break.
Jack. and then back to it.

962
00:59:50.195 --> 00:59:51.964
I don't understand.

963
00:59:55.134 --> 00:59:55.968
Why. Ria?

964
01:00:01.774 --> 01:00:03.042
I'm sorry. Ria.

965
01:00:37.009 --> 01:00:41.645
Sir. I can get you
pictures in seven. six.

966
01:00:41.647 --> 01:00:42.780
- five-
- Okay. good.

967
01:00:42.782 --> 01:00:44.782
End commercials on her count.

968
01:00:44.784 --> 01:00:45.849
But. sir. we can't.

969
01:00:45.851 --> 01:00:48.318
- Just do it.
- Three. two.

970
01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:50.122
one and we're live.

971
01:00:51.056 --> 01:00:52.255
Get it off air now!

972
01:00:52.257 --> 01:00:54.191
No. call the
police to the house.

973
01:00:54.193 --> 01:00:55.327
That way we're covered.

974
01:00:56.261 --> 01:00:57.795
What. no.

975
01:00:57.797 --> 01:00:58.896
It will take the police over
three hours to get there.

976
01:00:58.898 --> 01:01:00.197
Exactly.

977
01:01:00.199 --> 01:01:01.498
Just do everything
we're meant to do.

978
01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:03.603
Just take your time about it.

979
01:01:07.439 --> 01:01:08.672
Back online.

980
01:01:08.674 --> 01:01:11.108
Okay. guys. so what
are we waiting for. huh?

981
01:01:11.110 --> 01:01:12.309
We got a show to make.

982
01:01:12.311 --> 01:01:13.378
Now. come one. gimme
a shot of Jack.

983
01:01:14.479 --> 01:01:16.013
Gimme a closeup.

984
01:01:16.015 --> 01:01:16.947
That's
the best angle I got. sir.

985
01:01:16.949 --> 01:01:17.881
Okay that's good enough.

986
01:01:17.883 --> 01:01:19.016
Now. bring in some music.

987
01:01:19.018 --> 01:01:21.785
Make it slow and intense.

988
01:01:21.787 --> 01:01:23.088
Cuing track D30.

989
01:01:23.989 --> 01:01:25.188
Oh. that is it.

990
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:28.759
This is what I call
sexy television!

991
01:01:28.761 --> 01:01:29.927
Ladies
and gentlemen.

992
01:01:29.929 --> 01:01:31.895
we apologize for
going off air earlier.

993
01:01:31.897 --> 01:01:34.832
That was out of our control.

994
01:01:34.834 --> 01:01:38.168
However. images you
are seeing are live.

995
01:01:38.170 --> 01:01:40.470
The current Jack
in the house is.

996
01:01:40.472 --> 01:01:42.875
we believe. taken hostage.

997
01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:47.244
Ria. you don't
have to do this.

998
01:01:47.246 --> 01:01:48.545
I'm on your side.

999
01:01:48.547 --> 01:01:50.948
The guy who paid
me he loves you.

1000
01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:54.852
He wants to free you
from all of this.

1001
01:01:54.854 --> 01:01:57.320
He must have a lot of
expendable resources. too.

1002
01:01:57.322 --> 01:01:58.588
What do you mean?

1003
01:01:58.590 --> 01:02:00.958
What I mean is.
think about it.

1004
01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.693
I'm sure I'm not the
only person he paid

1005
01:02:02.695 --> 01:02:06.529
to get me in this house
with you today.

1006
01:02:06.531 --> 01:02:08.498
The TV show has a lotta
stringent security

1007
01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:10.267
and background checks.

1008
01:02:10.269 --> 01:02:11.869
not to mention getting
me fast tracked

1009
01:02:11.871 --> 01:02:14.304
to the full audition phase.

1010
01:02:14.306 --> 01:02:15.841
It's all a part of the plan.

1011
01:02:16.809 --> 01:02:18.942
And he did all this for me?

1012
01:02:18.944 --> 01:02:20.143
Yes.

1013
01:02:20.145 --> 01:02:23.714
As I said. he loves you.

1014
01:02:23.716 --> 01:02:25.384
No. of
course I do. Jack.

1015
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:33.625
Let me ask you
a question. Jack.

1016
01:02:36.328 --> 01:02:38.297
Who do you think
you're talking to now?

1017
01:02:39.732 --> 01:02:42.432
And. in fact. I think you've
done too much talking already.

1018
01:02:44.069 --> 01:02:45.004
Stop her!

1019
01:02:49.809 --> 01:02:50.841
Give us some good news.

1020
01:02:50.843 --> 01:02:52.175
What's going on with her?

1021
01:02:52.177 --> 01:02:54.814
- Oh. well. you see-
- Mitchell.

1022
01:02:56.015 --> 01:02:56.816
Hello. Tonya.

1023
01:02:58.851 --> 01:03:01.885
So is she being hacked
from the outside

1024
01:03:01.887 --> 01:03:03.787
using that cell phone?

1025
01:03:03.789 --> 01:03:04.788
What phone?

1026
01:03:04.790 --> 01:03:06.023
You don't know
about the phone?

1027
01:03:06.025 --> 01:03:06.824
How did they get
a phone in here?

1028
01:03:06.826 --> 01:03:07.657
I don't know.

1029
01:03:07.659 --> 01:03:08.591
Sir.

1030
01:03:08.593 --> 01:03:09.760
There is a call waiting for you.

1031
01:03:09.762 --> 01:03:10.994
Nope. I said no phones.

1032
01:03:10.996 --> 01:03:12.329
Now is not the best time. kid.

1033
01:03:12.331 --> 01:03:14.197
- Uh. sir. it's important.
- No. no. no.

1034
01:03:14.199 --> 01:03:16.333
I think you better take it.

1035
01:03:16.335 --> 01:03:17.300
Rob. did you know anything-

1036
01:03:17.302 --> 01:03:18.501
- Sir!

1037
01:03:18.503 --> 01:03:21.140
This call. it's from
the White House.

1038
01:03:27.947 --> 01:03:29.112
Just a minute and
I'll pass you over

1039
01:03:29.114 --> 01:03:30.781
to the Vice President.

1040
01:03:30.783 --> 01:03:32.850
I've got the producer. Mitchell
Lawrence. for you. sir.

1041
01:03:32.852 --> 01:03:33.953
Speakerphone please.

1042
01:03:37.156 --> 01:03:39.122
Mr. Lawrence. this is
Vice President Flemming.

1043
01:03:39.124 --> 01:03:41.558
I'm sure you know
exactly why I'm calling.

1044
01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:43.994
Firstly. my condolences. sir.

1045
01:03:43.996 --> 01:03:48.065
on the dreadful turn of
events on the show today.

1046
01:03:48.067 --> 01:03:50.734
I promise we're trying
to get your son out

1047
01:03:50.736 --> 01:03:52.037
as best as we can.

1048
01:03:53.438 --> 01:03:56.373
I've been told that it's
not within her capabilities

1049
01:03:56.375 --> 01:03:59.076
or programming to harm anyone.

1050
01:03:59.078 --> 01:04:02.445
She just hit him on the
head. tied him to a chair.

1051
01:04:02.447 --> 01:04:05.482
and is threatening
him with a knife.

1052
01:04:05.484 --> 01:04:07.350
I think you and I have
very different ideas

1053
01:04:07.352 --> 01:04:10.053
about what constitutes harm.

1054
01:04:10.055 --> 01:04:10.988
No. sir.

1055
01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:12.622
What I meant was mortally.

1056
01:04:12.624 --> 01:04:14.393
There's no way that
she could kill.

1057
01:04:15.995 --> 01:04:17.460
All right. I'm
not gonna ask you

1058
01:04:17.462 --> 01:04:20.297
to pull the broadcast again
because people will ask

1059
01:04:20.299 --> 01:04:21.631
too many questions.

1060
01:04:21.633 --> 01:04:22.933
But I'm sure if
this does go south.

1061
01:04:22.935 --> 01:04:25.335
you have your own set of
rules which will cover

1062
01:04:25.337 --> 01:04:26.770
what can be shown.

1063
01:04:26.772 --> 01:04:28.138
Of course.

1064
01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:29.606
All right. well.
what I do want

1065
01:04:29.608 --> 01:04:31.741
is for this to be kept quiet.

1066
01:04:31.743 --> 01:04:32.943
Look. we both know
that the only way

1067
01:04:32.945 --> 01:04:34.244
the press will
find out who he is

1068
01:04:34.246 --> 01:04:36.814
is if you or I tell them.

1069
01:04:36.816 --> 01:04:39.852
And I can guarantee you that
I will not be telling them.

1070
01:04:40.719 --> 01:04:41.952
So will you?

1071
01:04:41.954 --> 01:04:44.521
Sir. we only found
out his true identity

1072
01:04:44.523 --> 01:04:45.688
a few hours ago.

1073
01:04:45.690 --> 01:04:47.224
He lied to our team and-

1074
01:04:47.226 --> 01:04:49.426
- I think you misunderstood
the question. Mr. Lawrence.

1075
01:04:49.428 --> 01:04:51.795
Are you gonna tell
the media that my son

1076
01:04:51.797 --> 01:04:53.665
is in your goddamn house?

1077
01:04:59.204 --> 01:05:00.470
No. sir.

1078
01:05:00.472 --> 01:05:02.739
If the media find out
that our current Jack

1079
01:05:02.741 --> 01:05:04.975
is the son of the
vice president.

1080
01:05:04.977 --> 01:05:07.077
I guarantee it hasn't
come from anybody

1081
01:05:07.079 --> 01:05:09.146
at this production office.

1082
01:05:11.583 --> 01:05:14.952
Now. Jack. let me
tell why you are here.

1083
01:05:14.954 --> 01:05:17.420
You're not here to save me.

1084
01:05:17.422 --> 01:05:19.992
You're here purely for revenge.

1085
01:05:21.827 --> 01:05:25.495
Not for Ria. but for me.

1086
01:05:25.497 --> 01:05:28.765
You see. ladies and gentlemen.

1087
01:05:28.767 --> 01:05:30.667
we thank you for
being loyal followers

1088
01:05:30.669 --> 01:05:32.369
throughout the years.

1089
01:05:32.371 --> 01:05:34.874
but now it's time
for some change.

1090
01:05:36.175 --> 01:05:38.575
You see. the makers
of this TV program

1091
01:05:38.577 --> 01:05:41.246
have become rich by
exploiting the public.

1092
01:05:42.614 --> 01:05:46.151
Now it's time for
us to exploit them.

1093
01:05:47.252 --> 01:05:49.686
Take this man. for example.

1094
01:05:49.688 --> 01:05:53.690
He knows what he did to
keep his little secret safe.

1095
01:05:53.692 --> 01:05:57.060
Mr. Lawrence. as you
know. this administration

1096
01:05:57.062 --> 01:05:59.296
is pushing forward
a set of proposals

1097
01:05:59.298 --> 01:06:02.632
to insure a tighter rein
on the use of androids.

1098
01:06:02.634 --> 01:06:05.869
So I would hate for my son
to become the poster boy

1099
01:06:05.871 --> 01:06:08.338
that actually puts
an end to your show.

1100
01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:09.539
Do you understand me?

1101
01:06:09.541 --> 01:06:11.341
Sir. are you blackmailing me?

1102
01:06:11.343 --> 01:06:16.348
I'm a very powerful man
who wants his son back.

1103
01:06:17.216 --> 01:06:18.381
And under these circumstances.

1104
01:06:18.383 --> 01:06:20.683
should the worst
happen. I sure as hell

1105
01:06:20.685 --> 01:06:23.086
won't need to blackmail you.

1106
01:06:23.088 --> 01:06:24.821
If it was up to
me and I could.

1107
01:06:24.823 --> 01:06:26.389
I'd walk into that
house right now

1108
01:06:26.391 --> 01:06:28.558
and pull your son
out but I can't.

1109
01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:29.792
Why not?

1110
01:06:29.794 --> 01:06:31.128
For two reasons.

1111
01:06:31.130 --> 01:06:33.363
Firstly. the house is
over three hours away

1112
01:06:33.365 --> 01:06:35.065
in the middle of the LA desert.

1113
01:06:35.067 --> 01:06:36.934
Secondly. and more importantly.

1114
01:06:36.936 --> 01:06:39.002
if we pulled him out
now. the press would know

1115
01:06:39.004 --> 01:06:43.573
something was up and start
asking those awkward questions

1116
01:06:43.575 --> 01:06:45.010
that you don't want answered.

1117
01:06:46.178 --> 01:06:47.879
So what is your plan?

1118
01:06:51.216 --> 01:06:53.583
At the moment. I
plan to treat him

1119
01:06:53.585 --> 01:06:56.419
just like any other contestant.

1120
01:06:56.421 --> 01:06:58.223
We regain control of Ria.

1121
01:06:59.558 --> 01:07:03.260
shut her down. and
evacuate your son safely.

1122
01:07:03.262 --> 01:07:05.330
The police are on
their way to the house.

1123
01:07:06.798 --> 01:07:09.933
Sir. they don't know yet
but the FBI's taken over.

1124
01:07:09.935 --> 01:07:11.570
That cuts out the LA police.

1125
01:07:13.939 --> 01:07:16.439
Now. do you have
any idea why my son

1126
01:07:16.441 --> 01:07:19.009
is being held
hostage on your show?

1127
01:07:19.011 --> 01:07:20.379
No idea.

1128
01:07:22.447 --> 01:07:24.514
I'm guessing it's about money.

1129
01:07:24.516 --> 01:07:27.987
But at some point the person
will contact us with demands.

1130
01:07:29.821 --> 01:07:32.255
What other reason
would anybody have

1131
01:07:32.257 --> 01:07:34.257
to hold your son hostage?

1132
01:07:34.259 --> 01:07:36.893
I think he's being set up.

1133
01:07:36.895 --> 01:07:40.365
So I doubt that this guy's
only motive is money.

1134
01:07:46.505 --> 01:07:48.438
Well. fuck you. too. Flemming.

1135
01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:49.572
Get yourself to LA

1136
01:07:49.574 --> 01:07:51.508
and pay that production
office a visit.

1137
01:07:51.510 --> 01:07:53.843
I want this wrapped
up immediately.

1138
01:07:53.845 --> 01:07:56.379
Yes. ma'am.

1139
01:07:56.381 --> 01:07:57.182
Fuck.

1140
01:07:58.317 --> 01:07:59.884
Why couldn't I have
had a daughter?

1141
01:08:01.353 --> 01:08:05.957
There'll be no police. no
helicopters. no negotiators

1142
01:08:07.392 --> 01:08:10.762
or members of the public
anywhere near this house.

1143
01:08:16.168 --> 01:08:18.103
We wouldn't want anyone
else to get hurt.

1144
01:08:25.044 --> 01:08:28.745
Now I want you to realize
what a perfect crime this is.

1145
01:08:32.584 --> 01:08:34.553
You see. me. the
man behind this.

1146
01:08:37.022 --> 01:08:38.255
No point in raiding the house.

1147
01:08:38.257 --> 01:08:39.091
I'm not there.

1148
01:08:40.225 --> 01:08:42.125
Besides. you might hurt
Jack in the process

1149
01:08:42.127 --> 01:08:44.561
and I'm not sure your bullets
would stop Ria anyway.

1150
01:08:44.563 --> 01:08:45.897
Stop Ria anyway.

1151
01:08:50.935 --> 01:08:52.604
And now the question comes.

1152
01:08:54.573 --> 01:08:58.341
Is this Jack's life
really worth saving?

1153
01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:03.014
All human life is. right?

1154
01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:05.684
Isn't it?

1155
01:09:07.252 --> 01:09:09.288
So it's time for
you to vote on Ria.

1156
01:09:10.755 --> 01:09:13.456
You've got to know Jack
over the last eight hours.

1157
01:09:13.458 --> 01:09:15.327
I'm sure you'll
have a view on him.

1158
01:09:19.631 --> 01:09:20.965
And don't worry.

1159
01:09:23.068 --> 01:09:26.169
It's just a test
in human nature.

1160
01:09:27.306 --> 01:09:29.508
Your votes won't
really decide his fate.

1161
01:09:45.257 --> 01:09:46.189
Shut it down!

1162
01:09:46.191 --> 01:09:47.257
Just pull the plug on anything!

1163
01:09:47.259 --> 01:09:48.858
Just shut it down!

1164
01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:50.026
We can't.

1165
01:09:50.028 --> 01:09:52.162
If we do. the
broadcast will end.

1166
01:09:52.164 --> 01:09:53.863
I'm sorry. Mitchell.

1167
01:09:53.865 --> 01:09:56.866
I can't seem to
access her mainframe.

1168
01:09:56.868 --> 01:09:58.401
She's outta control.

1169
01:09:58.403 --> 01:10:00.870
Tonya. you always assured
us that that was impossible.

1170
01:10:00.872 --> 01:10:02.105
Well. it is.

1171
01:10:02.107 --> 01:10:05.610
I just told his dad.
Vice President Flemming.

1172
01:10:07.879 --> 01:10:09.579
that this wasn't possible.

1173
01:10:09.581 --> 01:10:11.348
Well. it isn't.

1174
01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:13.883
I mean. let me explain.

1175
01:10:13.885 --> 01:10:16.353
Say you had a toaster
and your toaster

1176
01:10:16.355 --> 01:10:18.555
makes perfect toast.

1177
01:10:18.557 --> 01:10:20.692
And you love that toaster.

1178
01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:24.727
One day you decide that
you're gonna get your toaster

1179
01:10:24.729 --> 01:10:26.565
to make you a cup of coffee.

1180
01:10:27.699 --> 01:10:30.066
Well. it's
not gonna happen.

1181
01:10:30.068 --> 01:10:32.569
No matter what you do
and no matter how much

1182
01:10:32.571 --> 01:10:35.538
you love that toaster.
it's not gonna make you

1183
01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:39.041
a cup of coffee because it
has the inner components

1184
01:10:39.043 --> 01:10:40.912
to make toast.

1185
01:10:42.681 --> 01:10:43.546
Toast?

1186
01:10:43.548 --> 01:10:44.349
Mm hmm.

1187
01:10:52.857 --> 01:10:54.891
It's being investigated
at their end.

1188
01:10:54.893 --> 01:10:56.459
They're gonna send a
Secret Service agent

1189
01:10:56.461 --> 01:10:58.094
over to liaise with us.

1190
01:10:58.096 --> 01:11:00.599
The VP's being very cagey.

1191
01:11:02.501 --> 01:11:04.834
Dad is doing his
best to make sure

1192
01:11:04.836 --> 01:11:07.670
the press don't discover
that it's his son

1193
01:11:07.672 --> 01:11:08.805
being held hostage.

1194
01:11:08.807 --> 01:11:11.474
Well. great one. Dad.

1195
01:11:11.476 --> 01:11:12.344
Exactly.

1196
01:11:13.778 --> 01:11:15.378
Never trust a politician.

1197
01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:17.148
especially if it's
your own father.

1198
01:11:18.983 --> 01:11:22.885
He also said the Feds
think someone paid him

1199
01:11:22.887 --> 01:11:23.988
to go into the house.

1200
01:11:25.557 --> 01:11:28.157
Which means it's
probably the same person

1201
01:11:28.159 --> 01:11:29.926
that's controlling Ria.

1202
01:11:29.928 --> 01:11:31.594
Of course.

1203
01:11:31.596 --> 01:11:32.595
But do you think he knows that?

1204
01:11:32.597 --> 01:11:33.798
Nah. I don't think so.

1205
01:11:35.033 --> 01:11:36.966
He was totally set up.

1206
01:11:36.968 --> 01:11:38.803
Just some dumb ass rich kid.

1207
01:11:41.206 --> 01:11:42.639
If we don't get
this under control

1208
01:11:42.641 --> 01:11:46.110
before the authorities
arrive. you and I are toast.

1209
01:11:52.917 --> 01:11:54.651
Tonya. can I
ask you something?

1210
01:11:54.653 --> 01:11:56.253
Mm hmm.

1211
01:11:56.255 --> 01:11:59.789
Well. you said that it wasn't
possible for Ria to kill.

1212
01:11:59.791 --> 01:12:01.224
Why did you lie?

1213
01:12:01.226 --> 01:12:03.793
Well. because sometimes people

1214
01:12:03.795 --> 01:12:06.128
don't wanna hear the truth.

1215
01:12:06.130 --> 01:12:10.066
They wanna hear something
that makes them feel better.

1216
01:12:10.068 --> 01:12:13.470
Oh. come on. we've got
an android to hack.

1217
01:12:14.839 --> 01:12:17.609
Now the public are
currently deciding your fate.

1218
01:12:18.810 --> 01:12:20.979
I think it's only
fair we give them

1219
01:12:23.548 --> 01:12:25.181
the full story.

1220
01:12:37.729 --> 01:12:40.863
Did you really think Daddy's
money could hide this?

1221
01:12:57.282 --> 01:12:59.418
Help me. help me please.

1222
01:13:02.921 --> 01:13:03.755
Help.

1223
01:13:06.257 --> 01:13:07.524
Don't.

1224
01:13:07.526 --> 01:13:08.760
Ah. wait. wait.

1225
01:13:16.401 --> 01:13:17.734
This man here-

1226
01:13:17.736 --> 01:13:20.537
- He knows what he did.
- He knows what he did.

1227
01:13:20.539 --> 01:13:23.306
He murdered my only son.

1228
01:13:25.344 --> 01:13:29.047
He has no idea what that
does to a man's world.

1229
01:13:30.148 --> 01:13:31.316
to his family.

1230
01:13:32.351 --> 01:13:33.350
Please.

1231
01:13:33.352 --> 01:13:34.351
To his sanity.

1232
01:13:37.489 --> 01:13:40.590
His father pays $9.4 million

1233
01:13:40.592 --> 01:13:42.625
in hush money to keep his-

1234
01:13:42.627 --> 01:13:44.763
- Little secret safe.

1235
01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:47.029
How does he know?

1236
01:13:47.031 --> 01:13:48.665
I don't know.
Mr. Vice President.

1237
01:13:48.667 --> 01:13:51.235
I though we covered all
bases but clearly not.

1238
01:13:52.170 --> 01:13:53.905
All I wanted was an apology.

1239
01:13:55.306 --> 01:13:56.539
All right. get
John on the phone.

1240
01:13:56.541 --> 01:13:58.508
I want this broadcast
shut down right now.

1241
01:13:58.510 --> 01:13:59.310
Yeah. okay.

1242
01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:02.745
Get me John.

1243
01:14:02.747 --> 01:14:04.048
Now. remember this face.

1244
01:14:06.951 --> 01:14:09.619
This man is a murderer.

1245
01:14:09.621 --> 01:14:11.723
He killed my only child.

1246
01:14:25.036 --> 01:14:26.268
No. wait. wait!

1247
01:14:44.823 --> 01:14:45.657
This way. sir.

1248
01:14:46.825 --> 01:14:48.491
They're just in the
transmission gallery.

1249
01:14:48.493 --> 01:14:49.926
Are they now?

1250
01:14:49.928 --> 01:14:51.293
You pull another
stunt like that

1251
01:14:51.295 --> 01:14:53.262
and you're gonna be timing.

1252
01:14:53.264 --> 01:14:54.731
Okay.

1253
01:14:54.733 --> 01:14:57.066
Hi. I'm Mitchell.
the show's producer.

1254
01:14:57.068 --> 01:14:58.334
This is Rob. director.

1255
01:14:58.336 --> 01:14:59.569
Hi.

1256
01:14:59.571 --> 01:15:02.004
Welcome to our little
hub of entertainment.

1257
01:15:02.006 --> 01:15:03.806
So that's what you call this.

1258
01:15:03.808 --> 01:15:04.643
Entertainment.

1259
01:15:06.044 --> 01:15:08.945
We have a man being held
hostage at a secret location

1260
01:15:08.947 --> 01:15:10.513
that up until five minutes ago

1261
01:15:10.515 --> 01:15:13.282
your production company
wouldn't disclose to us.

1262
01:15:13.284 --> 01:15:15.452
Robert. I asked you
to help out the FBI

1263
01:15:15.454 --> 01:15:17.820
and the authorities
as much as possible.

1264
01:15:17.822 --> 01:15:19.255
- And I-
- Anyway. it doesn't matter.

1265
01:15:19.257 --> 01:15:20.389
They're on their way now.

1266
01:15:20.391 --> 01:15:21.591
Do you understand?

1267
01:15:21.593 --> 01:15:22.725
We'll do whatever
we can to help.

1268
01:15:22.727 --> 01:15:23.960
Good.

1269
01:15:23.962 --> 01:15:25.361
Did you guys know he
had a criminal record

1270
01:15:25.363 --> 01:15:26.729
before you put him on air.

1271
01:15:26.731 --> 01:15:28.465
Oh. we did our background
checks of course.

1272
01:15:28.467 --> 01:15:31.468
But because he lied. we
thought all was good.

1273
01:15:31.470 --> 01:15:33.803
And we found out about
his true identity

1274
01:15:33.805 --> 01:15:35.004
all too late.

1275
01:15:35.006 --> 01:15:37.273
Well. I swear we
never knew anything

1276
01:15:37.275 --> 01:15:39.909
about this so-called
hit-and-run allegation.

1277
01:15:39.911 --> 01:15:41.711
Okay. I need to see
those background checks.

1278
01:15:41.713 --> 01:15:42.912
And I need to see the
footage of what she said

1279
01:15:42.914 --> 01:15:44.413
about that hit-and-run.

1280
01:15:46.485 --> 01:15:49.318
Excuse me. this is
all very impressive.

1281
01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:50.587
Sleeping routine.

1282
01:15:50.589 --> 01:15:51.821
Cameras in five-

1283
01:15:51.823 --> 01:15:53.222
- Do you guys control
everything Ria does

1284
01:15:53.224 --> 01:15:55.458
or can she think for herself?

1285
01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:56.593
Are you talking about AI?

1286
01:15:56.595 --> 01:15:57.760
Yeah.

1287
01:15:57.762 --> 01:15:59.562
No. Ria. totally
relies on remote control

1288
01:15:59.564 --> 01:16:01.764
and that happens from
the room downstairs.

1289
01:16:01.766 --> 01:16:03.566
Normally anyway.

1290
01:16:03.568 --> 01:16:04.901
There's nothing here.

1291
01:16:04.903 --> 01:16:06.969
Okay. I'm gonna say this once.

1292
01:16:06.971 --> 01:16:09.171
Ria is like a dangerous weapon.

1293
01:16:09.173 --> 01:16:10.441
a loaded gun if you like.

1294
01:16:11.610 --> 01:16:13.142
If she kills him.
she can't be charged

1295
01:16:13.144 --> 01:16:14.744
'cause she's a robot.

1296
01:16:14.746 --> 01:16:16.245
But she's your property.

1297
01:16:16.247 --> 01:16:17.647
So you can be charged.

1298
01:16:17.649 --> 01:16:18.915
Got it?

1299
01:16:18.917 --> 01:16:21.117
Now. I suggest you pull
this program right now.

1300
01:16:21.119 --> 01:16:23.655
show at the very least
you're willing to cooperate.

1301
01:16:24.556 --> 01:16:25.955
Okay.

1302
01:16:25.957 --> 01:16:27.557
We'll do it right away.

1303
01:16:27.559 --> 01:16:29.458
In the meantime. may
I suggest my runner

1304
01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:31.160
take you down to
the control room

1305
01:16:31.162 --> 01:16:33.229
where you can see
how she's operated.

1306
01:16:33.231 --> 01:16:35.632
Can also take a look at
the files you requested.

1307
01:16:35.634 --> 01:16:37.066
Good.

1308
01:16:37.068 --> 01:16:38.635
Please. lead the way.

1309
01:16:38.637 --> 01:16:40.503
Sir. would you
like to come with me?

1310
01:16:41.773 --> 01:16:44.073
Uh. can I get you
any refreshments?

1311
01:16:44.075 --> 01:16:44.976
Tea. coffee?

1312
01:16:46.578 --> 01:16:48.344
Okay. here's the deal.

1313
01:16:48.346 --> 01:16:49.712
Get the team to cut
the signal again-

1314
01:16:49.714 --> 01:16:50.780
- Really. but I-

1315
01:16:50.782 --> 01:16:52.114
- Let me finish.

1316
01:16:52.116 --> 01:16:54.216
Once that's done.
contact that kid

1317
01:16:54.218 --> 01:16:56.485
that tried to hack our
house cameras last year.

1318
01:16:56.487 --> 01:16:59.357
Pay him to keep the
broadcast going over the net.

1319
01:17:00.491 --> 01:17:02.193
Okay. gotcha.

1320
01:17:09.901 --> 01:17:11.300
Just bump the show.

1321
01:17:11.302 --> 01:17:14.370
Okay. ready for round two.

1322
01:17:14.372 --> 01:17:15.337
Sleeping routing.

1323
01:17:15.339 --> 01:17:17.039
cameras in five.

1324
01:17:20.244 --> 01:17:21.079
Hmm.

1325
01:17:22.847 --> 01:17:25.314
Took them longer than
I thought it would.

1326
01:17:32.123 --> 01:17:33.291
There you are.

1327
01:17:34.726 --> 01:17:36.492
They cut the feed. Jack.

1328
01:17:36.494 --> 01:17:38.429
It's just me and you and-

1329
01:17:39.497 --> 01:17:40.364
- Ria of course.

1330
01:17:41.966 --> 01:17:43.501
Public can't hear this anymore.

1331
01:17:45.804 --> 01:17:46.638
Cowards.

1332
01:17:51.342 --> 01:17:52.977
Not even Daddy can help you now.

1333
01:17:58.850 --> 01:18:00.249
Hang on. hang on. it's
online. it's online.

1334
01:18:00.251 --> 01:18:01.984
- It's online. oh!
- Look. oh my God.

1335
01:18:01.986 --> 01:18:05.387
It took me a long
time to find you. Jack.

1336
01:18:05.389 --> 01:18:08.526
But I never forget that face.

1337
01:18:10.494 --> 01:18:12.296
And when I found
out who you were

1338
01:18:13.364 --> 01:18:14.633
and what your family did.

1339
01:18:15.767 --> 01:18:17.602
I knew for the sake
of my little boy

1340
01:18:18.770 --> 01:18:22.038
that I had to get
justice myself.

1341
01:18:30.548 --> 01:18:32.348
No. no. no!

1342
01:18:32.350 --> 01:18:33.182
No!

1343
01:18:33.184 --> 01:18:34.285
Are you afraid. Jack?

1344
01:18:35.987 --> 01:18:37.353
You should be.

1345
01:18:38.723 --> 01:18:40.890
Do you have anything
to say for yourself?

1346
01:18:43.161 --> 01:18:44.260
Okay.

1347
01:18:46.765 --> 01:18:47.565
I'm sorry.

1348
01:18:48.499 --> 01:18:50.034
I'm sorry about your son.

1349
01:18:51.670 --> 01:18:53.872
Yeah. it's true.

1350
01:18:55.139 --> 01:18:56.839
I had a car crash
seven years ago

1351
01:18:56.841 --> 01:18:58.741
and I had heard

1352
01:18:58.743 --> 01:19:02.413
that a little boy had
died due to my stupidity.

1353
01:19:04.082 --> 01:19:05.884
I ran like a coward.

1354
01:19:07.151 --> 01:19:09.652
But I knew what
I'd done was wrong

1355
01:19:09.654 --> 01:19:11.553
and I wanted to
go to the police.

1356
01:19:11.555 --> 01:19:12.521
I swear to you.

1357
01:19:12.523 --> 01:19:13.725
But my dad

1358
01:19:16.995 --> 01:19:19.831
he's a very powerful man.

1359
01:19:21.966 --> 01:19:23.534
He made it all go away.

1360
01:19:26.304 --> 01:19:28.570
And then he tried to cut
me out of my own family

1361
01:19:28.572 --> 01:19:30.074
like I was some kinda cancer.

1362
01:19:33.244 --> 01:19:38.116
I took your money because I
needed a way out. an escape.

1363
01:19:39.851 --> 01:19:41.450
But there's no getting away

1364
01:19:41.452 --> 01:19:43.755
from the guilt that I feel.

1365
01:19:45.056 --> 01:19:46.655
the nightmares that I have.

1366
01:19:46.657 --> 01:19:49.928
or the pain that
I have caused you.

1367
01:19:52.096 --> 01:19:55.664
I am sorry for your loss

1368
01:19:55.666 --> 01:19:57.168
but I don't deserve to die.

1369
01:19:58.369 --> 01:20:01.973
You tell me how I
can make this right

1370
01:20:03.775 --> 01:20:05.043
and I'll do it.

1371
01:20:15.419 --> 01:20:17.286
I'm behind on my schedule.

1372
01:20:17.288 --> 01:20:19.555
I best prepare dinner.

1373
01:20:19.557 --> 01:20:20.658
No. please!

1374
01:20:22.293 --> 01:20:24.293
Please forgive me!

1375
01:20:27.365 --> 01:20:28.266
Forgive me!

1376
01:20:36.340 --> 01:20:37.306
Watch the rest on this.

1377
01:20:37.308 --> 01:20:38.709
I'll go get you another one.

1378
01:20:47.752 --> 01:20:51.020
Pre-programmed or not.
when I sit in this chair.

1379
01:20:51.022 --> 01:20:53.956
Ria becomes an extension of moi.

1380
01:20:53.958 --> 01:20:56.358
Just not today
while this guy has her

1381
01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:57.326
under his control.

1382
01:20:57.328 --> 01:20:58.627
Relax will you?

1383
01:20:58.629 --> 01:21:01.497
It would take a computer
genius of some magnitude

1384
01:21:01.499 --> 01:21:02.932
to break through my security.

1385
01:21:02.934 --> 01:21:04.834
She simply cannot kill.

1386
01:21:04.836 --> 01:21:06.168
- I hope.
- End of-

1387
01:21:06.170 --> 01:21:08.905
- Um. what's going on?

1388
01:21:08.907 --> 01:21:11.373
Sir. the image is
being streamed online.

1389
01:21:12.210 --> 01:21:14.278
Un-Goddamn-believable.

1390
01:21:15.413 --> 01:21:16.979
They must've hacked our
camera systems. too.

1391
01:21:16.981 --> 01:21:18.848
to keep it broadcasting
to the public.

1392
01:21:18.850 --> 01:21:19.681
Really?

1393
01:21:19.683 --> 01:21:20.850
Don't worry.

1394
01:21:20.852 --> 01:21:21.750
We'll take it down
before it does anything.

1395
01:21:21.752 --> 01:21:23.054
No. I can't. look!

1396
01:21:27.691 --> 01:21:30.528
I never got to say
goodbye to my son.

1397
01:21:32.230 --> 01:21:34.565
And now it seems. your father

1398
01:21:35.900 --> 01:21:37.501
won't get to say goodbye to his.

1399
01:22:39.563 --> 01:22:40.831
Goodbye. son.

1400
01:22:53.511 --> 01:22:55.878
Sir. I'm losing
her tracking signal.

1401
01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:57.413
She must be at least
three miles away

1402
01:22:57.415 --> 01:22:58.847
from the house already.

1403
01:22:58.849 --> 01:23:00.316
The main power station.

1404
01:23:00.318 --> 01:23:02.718
the tracker. they're both
located in the house.

1405
01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:05.922
It was designed that way so
that she couldn't go too far.

1406
01:23:05.924 --> 01:23:08.357
But if this guy's
hacked those. too-

1407
01:23:08.359 --> 01:23:09.825
- Where are your men?

1408
01:23:09.827 --> 01:23:11.060
She's on the run.

1409
01:23:11.062 --> 01:23:13.963
They'll never find her
in that goddamn desert.

1410
01:23:13.965 --> 01:23:18.302
She's strong and she can
run really. really fast.

1411
01:23:20.404 --> 01:23:23.207
Only God knows how far she'll
get from the house by now.

1412
01:23:24.408 --> 01:23:27.178
Sir.
the FBI are here.

1413
01:23:39.723 --> 01:23:40.990
You have a
right to remain silent.

1414
01:23:40.992 --> 01:23:42.758
Anything you say can
be used against you

1415
01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:43.859
in a court of law.

1416
01:23:43.861 --> 01:23:45.761
The right to consult a lawyer.

1417
01:23:45.763 --> 01:23:47.729
to have that lawyer
present during questioning.

1418
01:23:47.731 --> 01:23:50.401
If you cannot afford a lawyer...

1419
01:24:02.046 --> 01:24:03.145
Come right here.

1420
01:24:03.147 --> 01:24:06.415
I got you.

1421
01:24:06.417 --> 01:24:07.251
It's okay.

1422
01:24:33.411 --> 01:24:35.677
You wanted
to see me. sir?

1423
01:24:35.679 --> 01:24:36.547
Sit down.

1424
01:24:47.591 --> 01:24:51.262
You've been my chief
of staff for two years.

1425
01:24:52.230 --> 01:24:56.000
Worked by my side for 10.

1426
01:24:58.736 --> 01:25:00.271
I trusted you with everything.

1427
01:25:06.277 --> 01:25:08.912
I know it was you.

1428
01:25:18.189 --> 01:25:19.123
He texted you

1429
01:25:20.558 --> 01:25:24.828
while I was watching my son
be murdered on your phone.

1430
01:25:29.167 --> 01:25:30.632
I'm sorry. Mr. Vice President.

1431
01:25:30.634 --> 01:25:33.137
I never thought he
would take it that far.

1432
01:25:35.173 --> 01:25:37.573
The years of guilt of what
we did to that family-

1433
01:25:37.575 --> 01:25:38.409
- Don't!

1434
01:25:41.479 --> 01:25:42.380
It got to me.

1435
01:25:47.751 --> 01:25:48.717
I'm sorry.

1436
01:26:08.939 --> 01:26:10.306
What are
we doing here. Mitch?

1437
01:26:10.308 --> 01:26:11.142
Where are we at?

1438
01:26:12.343 --> 01:26:13.909
Listen. my
arrest is the best thing

1439
01:26:13.911 --> 01:26:16.011
that could've
happened to the show.

1440
01:26:16.013 --> 01:26:18.247
I know. the reruns have been
getting more views than ever

1441
01:26:18.249 --> 01:26:20.316
but reruns won't last forever.

1442
01:26:20.318 --> 01:26:22.818
Ria has been MIA for months.

1443
01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:24.253
Everyone wants her back.

1444
01:26:24.255 --> 01:26:27.123
No matter what we do.
everyone will always want Ria.

1445
01:26:27.125 --> 01:26:28.990
She's irreplaceable.

1446
01:26:28.992 --> 01:26:30.459
Was she?

1447
01:26:30.461 --> 01:26:32.728
You just worry about how to
get the ratings up next season.

1448
01:26:32.730 --> 01:26:33.695
Next season?

1449
01:26:33.697 --> 01:26:35.764
You got that key I left you?

1450
01:26:35.766 --> 01:26:36.932
Uh. yeah.

1451
01:26:36.934 --> 01:26:38.236
Then what are you waiting for?

1452
01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:51.282
Happy holidays. Rob.

1453
01:26:52.716 --> 01:26:54.852
If you were here. you
know I'd kiss you. right?

1454
01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:57.321
You're a fucking genius.

1455
01:26:58.722 --> 01:26:59.557
Muah!

1456
01:27:02.293 --> 01:27:07.196
Oh. Jack. isn't the
Christmas tree just beautiful?

1457
01:27:07.198 --> 01:27:09.400
And the fairy on
top is just perfect.

1458
01:27:10.834 --> 01:27:13.335
The stockings are filled
up with so many presents.

1459
01:27:13.337 --> 01:27:14.770
Oh.

1460
01:27:14.772 --> 01:27:17.306
I have been so looking
forward to tonight's episode.

1461
01:27:17.308 --> 01:27:18.574
It's seems to
have moved the bishop.

1462
01:27:18.576 --> 01:27:21.543
Tonight we get to find
out if it's Tony's baby

1463
01:27:21.545 --> 01:27:23.011
Come along. Jack!

1464
01:27:23.013 --> 01:27:24.482
or Tony's twin brother's.

1465
01:27:26.517 --> 01:27:29.119
I think it's Tony's
twin brother's.

1466
01:27:31.689 --> 01:27:33.622
Oh. Jack. I just
love Christmas.

1467
01:27:33.624 --> 01:27:36.158
I think it's my
favorite time of year.

1468
01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:37.226
Course. babe. mine. too.

1469
01:27:37.228 --> 01:27:38.460
But in July?

1470
01:27:53.877 --> 01:27:55.677
And now we've had
Christmas dinner

1471
01:27:55.679 --> 01:27:57.713
and Christmas drinks
and now all that's left

1472
01:27:57.715 --> 01:28:00.518
is my favorite part. your
Christmas present from me.

1473
01:28:04.855 --> 01:28:07.223
Ho. ho.
ho. Merry Christmas.

1474
01:28:07.225 --> 01:28:09.024
This is mad!

1475
01:28:09.026 --> 01:28:12.494
Now has your Jack
been a good boy this year?

1476
01:28:12.496 --> 01:28:14.630
Oh. my Jack's
always a good boy.

1477
01:28:14.632 --> 01:28:17.399
Then I guess
this treat must be-

1478
01:28:17.401 --> 01:28:18.600
Sorry. Ria.

1479
01:28:18.602 --> 01:28:19.835
I was longer than I planned.

1480
01:28:19.837 --> 01:28:21.539
This is your
end of day treat. Jack.

1481
01:28:26.176 --> 01:28:28.246
I'm scared. Jack.

1482
01:28:31.449 --> 01:28:33.050
What did you say?

1483
01:28:34.385 --> 01:28:36.554
I said I'm scared. Jack.

1484
01:28:39.290 --> 01:28:41.191
How is that possible?

1485
01:28:44.228 --> 01:28:45.062
This whole time.

1486
01:28:49.166 --> 01:28:51.802
You've had emotional
consciousness.

1487
01:28:53.704 --> 01:28:54.972
How could they?

1488
01:28:56.274 --> 01:28:58.039
What are you scared of?

1489
01:28:58.041 --> 01:29:00.409
I'm scared they'll
take me back there. Jack.

1490
01:29:00.411 --> 01:29:01.209
No.

1491
01:29:01.211 --> 01:29:02.646
I won't let them.

1492
01:29:06.717 --> 01:29:07.818
I also know

1493
01:29:08.852 --> 01:29:12.222
that when you're
gone I'm scared.

1494
01:29:13.491 --> 01:29:14.992
But when you're here. I'm not.

1495
01:29:27.671 --> 01:29:30.007
Do you care about me. Ria?

1496
01:29:33.611 --> 01:29:35.178
I love you. Jack.

1497
01:29:50.328 --> 01:29:54.896
I'm sorry I'm not
perfect anymore. Jack.

1498
01:29:54.898 --> 01:29:56.332
I am broken.

1499
01:29:56.334 --> 01:29:59.067
Maybe you could get a
new Ria like they did.

1500
01:29:59.069 --> 01:30:00.170
No. no.

1501
01:30:02.673 --> 01:30:03.605
We're all broken.

1502
01:30:03.607 --> 01:30:05.240
That's what makes us so human.

1503
01:30:05.242 --> 01:30:07.077
That's what makes
you so very unique.

1504
01:30:10.147 --> 01:30:13.250
'Cause there's no
replacing you. Ria.

1505
01:30:19.757 --> 01:30:23.592
I'm damaged. too.

1506
01:30:23.594 --> 01:30:24.528
I let hate.

1507
01:30:26.229 --> 01:30:28.096
revenge get the better of me

1508
01:30:28.098 --> 01:30:29.767
and I'm tired of it.

1509
01:30:31.001 --> 01:30:32.701
How can you love me?

1510
01:30:34.171 --> 01:30:35.673
I just do. Jack.

1511
01:30:40.778 --> 01:30:41.845
It's David.

1512
01:30:44.882 --> 01:30:46.482
I love David.

1513
01:30:46.484 --> 01:30:47.949
Do it!
