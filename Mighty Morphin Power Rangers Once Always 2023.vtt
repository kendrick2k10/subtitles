3
00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:55.263
Any last words?

4
00:00:55.972 --> 00:00:58.516
It's morphin' time! Triceratops!

5
00:01:04.272 --> 00:01:07.776
Putties. grind him into blue dust.

6
00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:30.090
Why'd you lead me here?

7
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.302
{\an8}Was your grand plan just to die outside
in the fresh sea breeze?

8
00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:40.266
{\an8}Oh. you brought friends.

9
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.976
{\an8}Now it's a reunion.

10
00:01:41.976 --> 00:01:45.146
Got your distress call
and zipped here as fast as we could.

11
00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:48.399
Thanks. Zack.
Man. that's Rita Repulsa?

12
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.443
The robot look is not for her.

13
00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:52.654
She'll look better on a junk heap.

14
00:01:52.654 --> 00:01:54.405
Destroy them all!

15
00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:14.884
{\an8}<i>♪ Go. go. Power Rangers ♪</i>

16
00:02:17.345 --> 00:02:20.181
{\an8}<i>♪ Go. go. Power Rangers ♪</i>

17
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.894

00:02:24.894 --> 00:02:28.606
<i>♪ You Mighty Morphin Power Rangers ♪</i>

19
00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.945
Oh! My face!

20
00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:36.447
I was having fun.

21
00:02:36.447 --> 00:02:38.825
But you wanna get serious?

22
00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:42.328
Come on. let's get deadly serious.

23
00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:48.918
You know. I loved that face.

24
00:02:48.918 --> 00:02:53.047
Just like I love all the power
in my new robot body.

25
00:02:53.047 --> 00:02:58.178
But I'll gladly give up some
of that energy for a spell that kills.

26
00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:03.516
Billy!

27
00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:10.106
Trini!

28
00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:13.401
No!

29
00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:23.870
Goodbye. Trini Kwan.

30
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.167
If anyone needs me. I'll be
in the Dark Dimension planning my revenge.

31
00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:50.104
{\an8}So what are we gonna tell her?
Maybe their mom drowned?

32
00:03:50.104 --> 00:03:52.857
No. No. Minh's too smart for that.

33
00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:57.612
Well. we gotta decide something quick
because school is out.

34
00:03:57.612 --> 00:03:59.906
The others might need help
searching the Dark Dimension.

35
00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:03.618
You can't decide quick on how to tell
someone the worst news of their life.

36
00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:07.914
And we can't lie to her.
It's gotta be the truth.

37
00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:10.750
- Look. Zordon's rules--
- Zack!

38
00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:13.294
Rules can be broken for a good reason.

39
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.716
Look. if Zordon was back like I had hoped.
I'm sure he'd say that Minh needs to know.

40
00:04:20.134 --> 00:04:22.011
It's always just been her and Trini.

41
00:04:22.845 --> 00:04:24.597
She doesn't have anybody else.

42
00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:27.308
Who's gonna take care of her now?

43
00:04:27.892 --> 00:04:30.812
Our team. we've never had to deal with
something like this before.

44
00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.398
No. we have to tell her the truth.

45
00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:36.192
- Otherwise. how's she gonna get closure?
- Billy! She's a kid!

46
00:04:36.192 --> 00:04:39.821
She's a kid. Billy. She doesn't need
to know that we're Power Rangers.

47
00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:42.782
She needs to know
that Rita Repulsa killed her mom.

48
00:04:56.045 --> 00:04:57.714
We have to tell her everything.

49
00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:44.010
Hey. You all good?

50
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.389
Sorry. Uncle Zack.
Time flies when I'm getting my sweat on.

51
00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:49.307
Okay.

52
00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:53.353
We're meant to leave
for the cemetery in ten minutes.

53
00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:58.149
You should clean up. get ready.
We don't wanna keep the others waiting.

54
00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:02.570
I know.

55
00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:07.116
Hey. you think they've made any headway
finding Robo Rita?

56
00:06:07.825 --> 00:06:10.036
- We can ask 'em when we see them.
- Okay.

57
00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:13.122
Wait. One more thing.
Did you get the flowers?

58
00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:14.832
Flowers?

59
00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:23.299
- Thanks. I'll go take a quick shower...
- Yes.

60
00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:25.676
...order you
a "World's Best Guardian" trophy...

61
00:06:25.676 --> 00:06:27.303
- Yes.
- ...then we can leave.

62
00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:28.221
Yes.

63
00:06:31.182 --> 00:06:34.352
You know. Billy always gives me
a hard time whenever we're late.

64
00:06:35.937 --> 00:06:39.524
Guess you can't use. "But I'm
a busy congressman." as an excuse anymore.

65
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.861
Sorry to mess you around.

66
00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:48.449
Today's not a day
I've been counting down to. you know?

67
00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:49.367
Yeah.

68
00:06:51.327 --> 00:06:53.204
Can't believe it's been a whole year.

69
00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:56.666
I know. Seems like yesterday.

70
00:06:57.834 --> 00:06:59.544
Dragonzord!
Pterodactyl!

71
00:06:59.544 --> 00:07:01.921
Triceratops!
Tyrannosaurus!

72
00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:03.714
- Is it me. or did that--?
- Come on.

73
00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:10.179
Before we begin. I just want to say.

74
00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:13.099
unhappy anniversary. Rangers.

75
00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:15.726
- That's Robo Rita. isn't it?
- An ambush.

76
00:07:15.726 --> 00:07:20.231
How predictable of you all
to get together on this special day.

77
00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:24.527
And I've been so busy preparing.

78
00:07:25.027 --> 00:07:28.156
I even reforged some of my old minions.

79
00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:31.075
Snizzard and Minotaur.

80
00:07:31.075 --> 00:07:36.539
Rows and rows of human graves.
This place is beautiful.

81
00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:39.876
Soon. all of Earth will be like this.

82
00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:43.254
Good. We'll start with the Rangers.

83
00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:44.922
Not if we end you first.

84
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.384
I gotta help my team.

85
00:07:48.384 --> 00:07:50.219
But I need you to stay safe. okay?

86
00:07:50.845 --> 00:07:52.013
But she's the one who...

87
00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:55.224
We gotta take her down.
I've been training for--

88
00:07:55.224 --> 00:07:59.270
Hard no. World's Best Guardian says.
"Do not move."

89
00:08:07.111 --> 00:08:09.864
Zack is back... in black.

90
00:08:12.241 --> 00:08:16.787
What? No "sorry I'm late"?
You'll both be sorry.

91
00:08:16.787 --> 00:08:19.624
None of them even complimented
my fancy new machine.

92
00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:22.293
- Snizzard. it's ready.

93
00:08:22.793 --> 00:08:24.212
Nice moves.

94
00:08:24.212 --> 00:08:27.173
- But mine are better.

95
00:08:35.556 --> 00:08:36.933
- What the--?
- Jace!

96
00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:40.645
A wonderful start to my collection.

97
00:08:41.854 --> 00:08:43.356
Time to finish you.

98
00:08:44.106 --> 00:08:45.566
Get her! Get her!

99
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.653
You're the one who's finished.

100
00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:50.738
- Show him. Snizzard.

101
00:08:50.738 --> 00:08:53.741
Gotcha!

102
00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:57.954
You think you can do better
against my new powers?

103
00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.123
No chance. Pinky.

104
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.004
Like fish in a barrel. Bring them to me.

105
00:09:07.713 --> 00:09:10.800
Your friends are finished.
We'll see.

106
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.135
It's all coming together.

107
00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:17.098
Hey. what kinda sick game is this?

108
00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:22.019
Oh. it's quite fun.
My machine is draining their energy.

109
00:09:22.019 --> 00:09:25.606
Soon. they'll be lifeless husks.
You can join them.

110
00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:37.034
- Zack! Billy!
We can't win here!

111
00:09:37.034 --> 00:09:38.077
Power down.

112
00:09:39.495 --> 00:09:40.830
Minh. car. now!

113
00:09:44.667 --> 00:09:46.002
Come on. come on.

114
00:09:46.002 --> 00:09:48.879
You think you can just drive away?

115
00:09:48.879 --> 00:09:50.256
Cowards!

116
00:09:58.472 --> 00:10:00.016
End of the line.

117
00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:05.313
Road's closed. Your move.

118
00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:07.106
- Go!
Go. go. go.

119
00:10:09.525 --> 00:10:10.776
Huh?

120
00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:16.157
Well-played. Cranston.
Fly while you can.

121
00:10:16.157 --> 00:10:19.660
Soon. every Power Ranger
will be where I want them.

122
00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.495
Much like your Trini.

123
00:10:34.342 --> 00:10:35.885
It all happened so fast.

124
00:10:36.552 --> 00:10:39.221
That machine that Robo Rita's building.
what does it do?

125
00:10:39.221 --> 00:10:43.351
Honestly? Something that uses our power
made by Rita Repulsa?

126
00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:45.936
That's a bad mix.
And if we don't put a stop to it.

127
00:10:46.437 --> 00:10:48.898
I... I don't think they're gonna make it.

128
00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:50.566
Then we gotta destroy her.

129
00:10:52.693 --> 00:10:54.320
-"We"?
- Yeah.

130
00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:58.616
This is Ranger business. not "teenage girl
that has homework due" business. okay?

131
00:10:59.241 --> 00:11:01.410
Wh-- She killed Mom.

132
00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:03.537
This is personal.

133
00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:06.374
You know how hard--

134
00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:08.793
- What you don't understand is--
- Let me finish!

135
00:11:10.002 --> 00:11:11.754
If Mom could do it. so can I.

136
00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:14.548
This is her legacy.

137
00:11:15.257 --> 00:11:16.133
I can help.

138
00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:19.220
Minh. I'm really sorry. but you can't.

139
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.721
You're not a Ranger.

140
00:11:20.721 --> 00:11:23.557
Those monsters would overpower you
in a second.

141
00:11:23.557 --> 00:11:27.019
And we can't risk losing you too.
Look. the best thing that you can do

142
00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:30.398
for everyone is to stay out of trouble
and let us sort this out.

143
00:11:31.023 --> 00:11:33.025
Says the guy who caused all this.

144
00:11:33.776 --> 00:11:38.322
We all know that if it wasn't for you.
my mom would still be here.

145
00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:42.535
Oh.

146
00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:44.870
That stung. huh?

147
00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:48.207
Good.

148
00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:56.799
Let's get to Cranston Tech.
It has the scanners we need.

149
00:11:56.799 --> 00:11:57.717
Let's go.

150
00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:08.477
Drip by drip.
their delicious Ranger powers ebb away.

151
00:12:08.477 --> 00:12:11.856
Let's see how much I've stolen from them.

152
00:12:17.027 --> 00:12:19.739
How disappointing.

153
00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:21.741
This process is too slow.

154
00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:24.827
We need as many Rangers as we can get.

155
00:12:25.327 --> 00:12:28.038
I can round the lambs up for slaughter.

156
00:12:28.539 --> 00:12:30.541
Not unless we can find them.

157
00:12:30.541 --> 00:12:34.837
If we can get them to morph.
then it'll be my time to shine.

158
00:12:34.837 --> 00:12:39.842
Good thing I know
exactly what draws out a Power Ranger.

159
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:46.640
No T-Rex. no Pterodactyl.
no Green Dragon Power.

160
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.225
Ay. ay. ay. ay. ay.

161
00:12:48.225 --> 00:12:52.062
We'll have to scan for something else
if we want to find our friends.

162
00:12:52.062 --> 00:12:53.230
Thanks. Alpha 9.

163
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:55.024
Oh. greetings. Zack.

164
00:12:55.024 --> 00:12:57.693
If the people upstairs only knew
they had the world's smartest robot

165
00:12:57.693 --> 00:12:58.778
right beneath their feet.

166
00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:02.573
Still such a charmer.
It's good to see you again.

167
00:13:03.073 --> 00:13:03.908
Been a while.

168
00:13:04.658 --> 00:13:08.329
I guess life is busy when you're
raising a teenager with attitude.

169
00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:10.998
Oh. Minh definitely has attitude.
Right. Billy?

170
00:13:12.708 --> 00:13:13.584
You all good?

171
00:13:15.753 --> 00:13:18.964
Yeah. It's just.
we haven't been in a mess like this since...

172
00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:22.676
Minh's right.

173
00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:26.180
It really is all my fault
that we lost Trini.

174
00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.849
Come on. man.
You were trying to do something good.

175
00:13:30.017 --> 00:13:30.851
Yeah.

176
00:13:31.602 --> 00:13:32.770
And look what happened.

177
00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:38.818
Finally. a hit.

178
00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:42.071
Our system is picking up
a powerful presence.

179
00:13:42.571 --> 00:13:45.741
Really? Maybe it's him
or remnants of him from the Z-Wave.

180
00:13:46.325 --> 00:13:49.495
Alpha 8. we've got to converge
the particles and draw them in.

181
00:13:49.495 --> 00:13:53.541
Initializing Z-Wave energy reconstitution.

182
00:13:55.292 --> 00:13:56.627
It's working!

183
00:13:56.627 --> 00:13:59.213
Zordon! Zordon. are you here?

184
00:14:02.132 --> 00:14:06.720
- Ah. Billy. I don't think that's Zordon.

185
00:14:14.061 --> 00:14:17.439
Malfunction. Billy.
- Alpha!

186
00:14:17.439 --> 00:14:18.983
You have to...

187
00:14:19.733 --> 00:14:21.777
What's happening?
- Get back!

188
00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.616
No. no. no!

189
00:14:27.616 --> 00:14:30.077
Yes!

190
00:14:30.077 --> 00:14:33.914
After all these years. I'm free!

191
00:14:34.456 --> 00:14:36.792
It's time for revenge.

192
00:14:37.543 --> 00:14:38.377
No.

193
00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:40.838
No. it... it can't be.

194
00:14:41.338 --> 00:14:43.090
Fact-check. Billy.

195
00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:45.551
You were looking for your precious Zordon.

196
00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:48.512
but when he sacrificed himself
with the Z-Wave.

197
00:14:48.512 --> 00:14:54.310
it wasn't just <i>his</i> particles
that spread across the universe. Get it?

198
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:59.690
The evil was purged from my being.
and the waves scattered it across space.

199
00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:03.527
Until today.
when you put me back together.

200
00:15:03.527 --> 00:15:06.155
and I found a new body.

201
00:15:07.031 --> 00:15:11.827
Now. Rita Repulsa will reign again.

202
00:15:14.955 --> 00:15:16.707
I need backup at the Command Center.

203
00:15:16.707 --> 00:15:17.917
It's Rita.

204
00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:21.795
- I'll try to lure her outside. but hurry!

205
00:15:21.795 --> 00:15:24.798
Oh. my poor predecessor.

206
00:15:24.798 --> 00:15:26.383
Look. let's focus on the now.

207
00:15:27.259 --> 00:15:28.802
Robo Rita's a force to be reckoned with.

208
00:15:28.802 --> 00:15:31.513
And we gotta make sure
she doesn't hurt anybody else.

209
00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:34.975
My monster scan has found something.

210
00:15:34.975 --> 00:15:36.644
Looks like a live video feed.

211
00:15:37.227 --> 00:15:39.605
It's not Rita. It's Putties.

212
00:15:40.105 --> 00:15:43.567
And it's not just Angel Grove.
It's all over the world!

213
00:15:43.567 --> 00:15:46.111
We knew she would return.
We're prepared for this.

214
00:15:46.111 --> 00:15:48.948
- Alpha 9. it's time.
- Yes. sir.

215
00:15:50.032 --> 00:15:53.202
- Attention all Power Ranger teams.

216
00:15:53.202 --> 00:15:55.371
Bandora Protocol initiated.

217
00:15:55.913 --> 00:15:58.248
Get to your assigned stations now.

218
00:15:58.248 --> 00:16:03.170
If I remember the plan correctly.
visitors in three. two. one.

219
00:16:04.922 --> 00:16:08.050
One minute. I'm helping out
at JJ's junior karate camp.

220
00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:11.804
and the next. I'm sneaking off
to the bathroom to teleport. Seriously?

221
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:14.890
Bandora Protocol's happening.

222
00:16:15.849 --> 00:16:16.850
Robo Rita's back?

223
00:16:18.352 --> 00:16:22.898
Come on. guys.
Is this really another training exercise?

224
00:16:22.898 --> 00:16:26.694
Because. hello. I just heated my lunch.

225
00:16:26.694 --> 00:16:29.029
It's not training. Rita is back.

226
00:16:29.029 --> 00:16:31.407
- So Tommy. Jason. Kim are fighting her?
- No.

227
00:16:32.282 --> 00:16:35.327
Unfortunately. they've been captured.

228
00:16:35.911 --> 00:16:36.996
So we need your help.

229
00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:44.586
"Not a Ranger"? "Not yet." you mean!

230
00:16:49.216 --> 00:16:51.260
You'll pay for what you did. Rita.

231
00:16:59.184 --> 00:17:03.022
{\an8}<i>Monsters known as Putty Patrollers
haven't been seen in Angel Grove</i>

232
00:17:03.022 --> 00:17:05.190
{\an8}<i>for many years. but today. they're back.</i>

233
00:17:06.483 --> 00:17:08.902
{\an8}<i>Citizens. keep your eyes open
for attackers.</i>

234
00:17:08.902 --> 00:17:12.072
{\an8}<i>Reports say this is happening
all over the world.</i>

235
00:17:12.072 --> 00:17:14.616
{\an8}<i>Power Rangers. we need you
today more than ev--</i>

236
00:17:32.217 --> 00:17:34.011
It sounds like you barely got away.

237
00:17:34.511 --> 00:17:37.514
And now we have an army of Putties
on our hands. What's next?

238
00:17:37.514 --> 00:17:40.684
It's likely we'll find ourselves
in a Megazord situation soon.

239
00:17:40.684 --> 00:17:44.354
Billy and I took months
getting the Sabertooth Tiger Zord working

240
00:17:44.354 --> 00:17:45.898
without a Yellow Ranger.

241
00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:50.652
So Dino Megazord is off the table then
without Jace and Kim?

242
00:17:50.652 --> 00:17:51.570
Not quite.

243
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.865
Alpha and I have been experimenting
with secondary connections of the grid.

244
00:17:54.865 --> 00:17:58.535
We made these Proxy Power Coins
as a contingency.

245
00:17:58.535 --> 00:18:01.288
Now all of you can use Dino powers.

246
00:18:01.288 --> 00:18:03.373
Whoa. Zordon was very clear.

247
00:18:04.124 --> 00:18:06.794
Duplicating active powers
is very dangerous.

248
00:18:06.794 --> 00:18:10.506
I don't care how dangerous
too much pink energy is. Once a Ranger...

249
00:18:11.673 --> 00:18:13.133
Always a Ranger.

250
00:18:13.133 --> 00:18:15.135
You can definitely count us in.

251
00:18:15.886 --> 00:18:19.348
All right. First up. there's been
injuries reported already in Angel Grove.

252
00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:21.642
We cannot let the Putties
run rampant any longer.

253
00:18:22.226 --> 00:18:23.268
If that's the case.

254
00:18:24.561 --> 00:18:25.604
it's morphin' time!

255
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.648
Mastodon!

256
00:18:27.648 --> 00:18:28.941
Pterodactyl!

257
00:18:28.941 --> 00:18:30.234
Triceratops!

258
00:18:30.234 --> 00:18:31.652
Tyrannosaurus!

259
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:35.656
I never get tired of that.

260
00:18:35.656 --> 00:18:38.534
Now. go. go. Power Rangers!

261
00:18:41.036 --> 00:18:43.914
Run!

262
00:18:46.834 --> 00:18:47.751
Help!

263
00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:50.629
Hey!

264
00:18:54.049 --> 00:18:56.301
You Putties want a fight? You found one.

265
00:18:57.427 --> 00:18:59.972
All these years.
and they still sound like angry turkeys.

266
00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:02.182
Then let's carve 'em up.

267
00:19:08.105 --> 00:19:10.941
Finally. my Ranger tracker has got a hit.

268
00:19:10.941 --> 00:19:13.986
So somebody's morphed. have they?

269
00:19:14.653 --> 00:19:17.781
Are we surprised my Putty bait worked?

270
00:19:17.781 --> 00:19:20.868
There's a reason I'm in charge. you fools.

271
00:19:20.868 --> 00:19:25.539
Go to the grid fluctuation coordinates
and get the Rangers.

272
00:19:25.539 --> 00:19:30.169
My masterpiece has a thirst for power.
and those do-gooders will quench it.

273
00:19:30.752 --> 00:19:32.004
Yes. my queen.

274
00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.804
Wait. didn't we get Red and Pink?

275
00:19:40.804 --> 00:19:43.140
Different Red.
Different Pink.

276
00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:44.349
Same powers.

277
00:19:46.935 --> 00:19:49.605
Careful of Snizzard. Rocky.
Don't get grabbed.

278
00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:51.690
Noted.

279
00:19:54.109 --> 00:19:56.653
We'll get you out of here. everybody.
Stay calm.

280
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.077
Back off!

281
00:20:07.456 --> 00:20:08.624
Come on. Run.

282
00:20:08.624 --> 00:20:10.334
Everyone. follow me.

283
00:20:11.376 --> 00:20:12.211
This way.

284
00:20:12.753 --> 00:20:15.172
Well. look what we have here.

285
00:20:15.172 --> 00:20:17.674
Something to sink my fangs into.

286
00:20:17.674 --> 00:20:20.177
Huh? [grunts] That's not good.

287
00:20:20.177 --> 00:20:21.345
Sweet dreams.

288
00:20:27.392 --> 00:20:30.979
Curses.
Nice rotation on that kick.

289
00:20:30.979 --> 00:20:33.273
- You've still got it.
- I never lost it.

290
00:20:33.273 --> 00:20:35.943
Time to move.
The civilians here are safe.

291
00:20:35.943 --> 00:20:37.486
On to the next fight.

292
00:20:37.486 --> 00:20:38.445
Ha!

293
00:20:39.738 --> 00:20:42.991
They slithered away.
- Who cares?

294
00:20:42.991 --> 00:20:46.119
As long as they're morphed.
I can track them.

295
00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:50.332
<i>- Seems they went to the park.
- A nice place to grab a bite.</i>

296
00:20:50.332 --> 00:20:51.625
Oh no.

297
00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:55.420
The team's about to find themselves
in a monster sandwich.

298
00:20:58.131 --> 00:21:02.052
<i>This is a worldwide alert
to all Power Rangers.</i>

299
00:21:02.052 --> 00:21:03.637
<i>Minotaur is tracking you.</i>

300
00:21:04.137 --> 00:21:06.682
<i>As long as you're morphed.
he can find you.</i>

301
00:21:06.682 --> 00:21:08.392
<i>You must power down.</i>

302
00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:11.019
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

303
00:21:11.019 --> 00:21:13.897
<i>- Power down. or he'll find you.</i>
- Got it.

304
00:21:15.107 --> 00:21:16.024
Good work. Alpha.

305
00:21:17.234 --> 00:21:18.443
You all heard that. right?

306
00:21:18.443 --> 00:21:20.654
Minotaur's tracking us.
which means--

307
00:21:21.822 --> 00:21:23.615
- Yep.
They followed us here.

308
00:21:23.615 --> 00:21:28.412
- Ruin them. Snizzard.
- My pleasure.

309
00:21:28.412 --> 00:21:29.454
Power down.

310
00:21:33.542 --> 00:21:35.085
Untrackable!

311
00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.089
Rangers. look. look.

312
00:21:39.589 --> 00:21:41.717
My new scans picked up activity

313
00:21:41.717 --> 00:21:44.928
in a concentrated spot
on the lunar surface.

314
00:21:45.554 --> 00:21:46.847
Rita's Moon Palace.

315
00:21:46.847 --> 00:21:48.557
If she's making herself at home.

316
00:21:48.557 --> 00:21:51.143
then our friends
and Rita's machine must be there too.

317
00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:52.894
What's that?

318
00:21:52.894 --> 00:21:54.730
It's an incoming call.

319
00:21:57.065 --> 00:21:58.317
<i>We got the Protocol alert.</i>

320
00:21:58.317 --> 00:22:00.986
<i>Our ship is zooming to you
from the Sirius System.</i>

321
00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:03.905
<i>I'm afraid it'll be six hours
before we reach your side of the galaxy.</i>

322
00:22:03.905 --> 00:22:05.407
<i>Then we'll be in teleport range.</i>

323
00:22:05.991 --> 00:22:08.618
<i>Unfortunately. Robo Rita's timing
is the worst.</i>

324
00:22:08.618 --> 00:22:09.870
It always is.

325
00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:12.706
<i>So she got Jason. Kimberly. and Tommy.</i>

326
00:22:13.832 --> 00:22:15.959
<i>It's rough. especially for you. Kat.</i>

327
00:22:15.959 --> 00:22:17.919
I'm not gonna tell JJ
what happened to his father

328
00:22:17.919 --> 00:22:19.296
'cause he'll be home soon.

329
00:22:19.296 --> 00:22:23.175
We're going to get Tommy--
All of them back today.

330
00:22:23.175 --> 00:22:25.594
<i>Right. you've got this.</i>

331
00:22:25.594 --> 00:22:29.056
<i>Oh. and Billy.
that stealth tech you designed for us.</i>

332
00:22:29.056 --> 00:22:31.391
<i>it's a game changer. Thank you.</i>

333
00:22:31.391 --> 00:22:32.517
You're very welcome.

334
00:22:33.101 --> 00:22:35.270
<i>Being invisible has definitely helped
our team's run-ins</i>

335
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:36.855
<i>with the Troobian Empire.</i>

336
00:22:36.855 --> 00:22:38.440
Safe travels. Okay?

337
00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.400
<i>Thanks. And good luck.</i>

338
00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:45.072
So. what now?

339
00:22:45.072 --> 00:22:48.033
Well. there's still Putties in town.

340
00:22:48.533 --> 00:22:49.534
In every town.

341
00:22:50.285 --> 00:22:51.286
We can't morph.

342
00:22:52.579 --> 00:22:54.956
People aren't safe.

343
00:22:56.375 --> 00:22:57.959
- We gotta do something.
- Look...

344
00:22:58.919 --> 00:23:02.714
Now. we know Rita's on the Moon. right?
So why not let's just go there?

345
00:23:03.215 --> 00:23:04.049
Crash her party.

346
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:06.676
Snizzard and Minotaur will get in the way.

347
00:23:07.552 --> 00:23:09.638
Unless we can draw them out.

348
00:23:11.098 --> 00:23:12.265
That's a good thought.

349
00:23:12.808 --> 00:23:14.351
I bet you I can develop something

350
00:23:14.351 --> 00:23:17.312
that will keep them away from the Moon
and keep them away from us.

351
00:23:17.813 --> 00:23:20.816
I bet you I can use stealth technology
I developed for Adam and Aisha.

352
00:23:20.816 --> 00:23:24.778
I bet you can too. Billy.
Love that big brain of yours.

353
00:23:25.529 --> 00:23:29.199
They're made of metal. right?
Maybe we can exploit that.

354
00:23:30.534 --> 00:23:31.410
Oh no.

355
00:23:32.536 --> 00:23:35.163
Is that... Minh?

356
00:23:35.664 --> 00:23:36.498
Minh!

357
00:23:36.998 --> 00:23:38.458
Ay. ay. ay!

358
00:23:47.467 --> 00:23:49.219
Get out of here. I've got this.

359
00:23:51.555 --> 00:23:53.598
Sorry. Am I interrupting?

360
00:23:54.975 --> 00:23:56.476
You guys are in for a treat.

361
00:23:59.271 --> 00:24:00.647
It's morphin' time!

362
00:24:01.773 --> 00:24:02.983
Sabertooth Tiger!

363
00:24:22.002 --> 00:24:23.628
Whoa.

364
00:25:08.882 --> 00:25:11.259
Messing with this place was a big mistake.

365
00:25:36.493 --> 00:25:37.827
Time for Hip Hop Kido.

366
00:25:43.833 --> 00:25:45.293
Are you break-dance fighting?

367
00:26:06.731 --> 00:26:07.566
Minh.

368
00:26:09.859 --> 00:26:13.280
- I wanted to be like Mom.
- You deliberately disobeyed me.

369
00:26:15.282 --> 00:26:16.992
Let's go.

370
00:26:19.869 --> 00:26:21.871
<i>You were right. It's just what we need.</i>

371
00:26:23.123 --> 00:26:26.126
The others got back from the youth center.
We'll head over and get set up soon.

372
00:26:26.126 --> 00:26:27.877
<i>Okay. great. See ya.</i>

373
00:26:27.877 --> 00:26:29.212
Awesome place.

374
00:26:30.088 --> 00:26:32.215
Who knew Cranston Tech
was hiding all this?

375
00:26:33.425 --> 00:26:35.885
Not the public and not my employees.

376
00:26:35.885 --> 00:26:38.888
This place is secret.
so let's. uh. keep it that way. Okay?

377
00:26:43.059 --> 00:26:44.477
She's gonna need a talk.

378
00:26:45.979 --> 00:26:46.813
Can I help?

379
00:26:48.189 --> 00:26:49.441
Thanks. I got this.

380
00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:53.111
- The plan needs you. It's urgent.
- Agreed.

381
00:26:53.111 --> 00:26:55.363
- All right. We'll be back soon.
- All right.

382
00:26:59.659 --> 00:27:01.328
Pleasure to meet you.

383
00:27:01.328 --> 00:27:03.288
- I am--
I'm sorry. Alpha.

384
00:27:04.164 --> 00:27:07.000
- Can we have the room?
- No problem. Zack.

385
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.919
My sensors are detecting a vibe.

386
00:27:12.505 --> 00:27:13.340
Come on.

387
00:27:14.341 --> 00:27:15.175
Give it to me.

388
00:27:20.513 --> 00:27:22.307
If I thought this
was gonna get you in trouble.

389
00:27:22.307 --> 00:27:24.142
I never would have told you the truth.

390
00:27:24.142 --> 00:27:25.310
- But Billy--
- What?

391
00:27:25.977 --> 00:27:26.853
He insisted.

392
00:27:26.853 --> 00:27:29.397
He thought it'd be good for you.
Closure and all that.

393
00:27:29.397 --> 00:27:32.734
But here we are. in a full-on crisis.
and you're trying to play Ranger.

394
00:27:32.734 --> 00:27:34.069
What's wrong with that?

395
00:27:34.069 --> 00:27:36.738
All of you and Mom
did exactly the same thing.

396
00:27:36.738 --> 00:27:38.990
I'm just following her example.

397
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:41.242
Isn't that a good thing?

398
00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:49.626
What do you think it means to be a Ranger?
Kicking butt? Cute quips? Having fun?

399
00:27:51.002 --> 00:27:51.920
It's hard.

400
00:27:52.754 --> 00:27:53.588
I know.

401
00:27:54.381 --> 00:27:57.050
But someone needs to dole out justice
on the bad guys.

402
00:27:59.052 --> 00:28:00.345
Rita killed Mom.

403
00:28:01.262 --> 00:28:02.514
She needs to go down.

404
00:28:03.264 --> 00:28:05.850
And I'm ready. I'm happy to do it.

405
00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:07.060
Whatever it takes.

406
00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.397
So why won't that thing let me morph?

407
00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:11.940
Minh...

408
00:28:12.899 --> 00:28:17.028
What you're feeling. what you want.
it's not justice. It's revenge.

409
00:28:17.821 --> 00:28:20.699
When I was your age. my mentor told me
that only monsters seek revenge.

410
00:28:21.282 --> 00:28:24.703
That's what Robo Rita is doing now.
She was defeated by the Rangers.

411
00:28:24.703 --> 00:28:27.580
Now she wants to even the score
and hurt us as much as she can.

412
00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:31.793
That's why she... did what she did to Trini.

413
00:28:34.003 --> 00:28:37.966
A mission of revenge can never end well.
That's not what I want for you.

414
00:28:41.052 --> 00:28:42.429
What about what I want?

415
00:28:43.513 --> 00:28:45.348
Maybe it's not your call.

416
00:28:48.393 --> 00:28:49.728
You wanna be a hero?

417
00:28:50.729 --> 00:28:52.147
It's a selfless path.

418
00:28:53.648 --> 00:28:56.443
It's not always easy. But I do my best.

419
00:28:59.612 --> 00:29:02.699
Setting aside your ambitions
can be a good thing.

420
00:29:03.283 --> 00:29:06.828
Like me. making sure
that you have a good life and a home.

421
00:29:08.163 --> 00:29:11.916
It was worth giving up
your career in Congress... for me?

422
00:29:13.168 --> 00:29:15.754
You are absolutely worth it.

423
00:29:17.922 --> 00:29:20.717
And if you can understand that.
then you can understand

424
00:29:20.717 --> 00:29:23.928
how hard Billy is trying to fix
what he set in motion.

425
00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:29.893
Zordon sacrificed himself for us long ago.

426
00:29:30.894 --> 00:29:32.020
You never met him.

427
00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:34.355
He was our mentor but almost

428
00:29:35.356 --> 00:29:36.232
a father figure.

429
00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:41.070
Billy was trying to bring him back.
He didn't know this would happen.

430
00:29:43.865 --> 00:29:46.951
I... I didn't know that's how he felt.

431
00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:52.665
Just stay here
while we execute our plan. Okay?

432
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:54.918
Yeah.

433
00:29:54.918 --> 00:29:57.796
And don't worry.
We've saved the world before.

434
00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.350
Now it'll really pack a punch.

435
00:30:12.018 --> 00:30:13.895
All right. Kat. Lift her up.

436
00:30:22.028 --> 00:30:24.948
So. uh. this thing is used
to sort old scrap. huh?

437
00:30:24.948 --> 00:30:25.865
Yeah.

438
00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:29.661
Well. Minotaur and Snizzard
sure fit that definition.

439
00:30:32.747 --> 00:30:33.873
All right. we're set.

440
00:30:37.794 --> 00:30:38.837
Let's bait the trap.

441
00:30:41.214 --> 00:30:43.716
It's morphin' time! Triceratops!

442
00:30:43.716 --> 00:30:45.635
- Pterodactyl!
- Tyrannosaurus!

443
00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.306
All right. we're set.

444
00:30:50.306 --> 00:30:52.851
They could be here any second.
so look sharp.

445
00:30:52.851 --> 00:30:54.269
Hm.
Always do.

446
00:30:54.269 --> 00:30:58.815
Every Ranger we capture
gives us another boost to the finish line.

447
00:30:58.815 --> 00:31:03.361
It's funny. I never believed in
their whole teamwork thing.

448
00:31:03.361 --> 00:31:05.655
but together. they are more.

449
00:31:05.655 --> 00:31:08.199
More power for me. that is.

450
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:13.580
Another three Rangers
just morphed in Angel Grove.

451
00:31:14.163 --> 00:31:16.583
Shall we?
Just go. then.

452
00:31:17.542 --> 00:31:20.461
Oh. higher power levels than I thought.

453
00:31:23.548 --> 00:31:24.591
Bingo.

454
00:31:24.591 --> 00:31:26.426
Surprise. Rangers.

455
00:31:26.426 --> 00:31:28.386
Oh. right there is perfect.

456
00:31:34.309 --> 00:31:36.853
What is this?

457
00:31:36.853 --> 00:31:39.314
Like your hairy friend said.
a surprise.

458
00:31:39.814 --> 00:31:41.941
Thanks. I hate it.

459
00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:44.402
Bye now! Ha!

460
00:31:45.528 --> 00:31:48.823
Yes. the trap's holding.
- Affirmative.

461
00:31:48.823 --> 00:31:52.410
The powerful electromagnetic field
will prevent them from teleporting away.

462
00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:54.579
Phase one. dusted. Yes!

463
00:31:54.579 --> 00:31:55.663
Good job.

464
00:31:58.166 --> 00:32:00.335
Wait. Hold up. You're letting them live?

465
00:32:01.127 --> 00:32:03.963
That doesn't seem right. does it?
What if they get loose?

466
00:32:03.963 --> 00:32:05.340
This is the plan.

467
00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:08.509
Look. all-out destruction
is rarely the most optimal strategy.

468
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:12.680
Now. where are
those stealth tech projectors?

469
00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.975
Sorry.
I got lost in the vault again.

470
00:32:17.143 --> 00:32:20.521
These are one use only. so be careful.
Click here. and it projects

471
00:32:20.521 --> 00:32:24.025
a subatomic diffraction field that covers
infrared and ultraviolet light.

472
00:32:24.025 --> 00:32:25.568
- So we'll be invisible.
- Yep.

473
00:32:25.568 --> 00:32:29.656
- Ah. love it.
- Rita will never <i>see</i> phase two coming.

474
00:32:29.656 --> 00:32:31.491
- Robot's got jokes.

475
00:32:31.491 --> 00:32:34.369
We'll be back soon. and when that happens.
I need you to be here.

476
00:32:34.369 --> 00:32:35.912
Alpha will keep you company.

477
00:32:36.913 --> 00:32:37.747
Hm.

478
00:32:41.668 --> 00:32:43.711
Nice.
Let's make it quick.

479
00:32:43.711 --> 00:32:46.464
- Alpha. send us to Rita's lair.
On it.

480
00:32:46.464 --> 00:32:48.716
Ah. that's my foot!
Oops.

481
00:32:48.716 --> 00:32:50.259
Ow.
Sorry.

482
00:32:50.259 --> 00:32:52.220
I know I have heavy feet.

483
00:32:55.473 --> 00:32:57.475
Better get ready for what's coming.

484
00:33:00.436 --> 00:33:02.647
Uncle Zack told me
what being a hero means.

485
00:33:02.647 --> 00:33:04.816
Guess I'll warm up the volcano.

486
00:33:05.775 --> 00:33:08.444
- Mind if I borrow?
- I don't think that's a good idea.

487
00:33:08.444 --> 00:33:10.196
- Okay. Thanks. Bye.
- But--

488
00:33:10.196 --> 00:33:11.864
Ay. ay. ay. ay. ay!

489
00:33:18.913 --> 00:33:20.581
Maybe too much of a flex.

490
00:33:21.541 --> 00:33:22.375
Overdone.

491
00:33:30.216 --> 00:33:31.092
Hm.

492
00:33:36.347 --> 00:33:37.181
Come on!

493
00:33:38.725 --> 00:33:39.934
Why won't you fly?

494
00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:42.979
Hey! Hey!

495
00:33:43.813 --> 00:33:44.814
Help!

496
00:33:44.814 --> 00:33:46.941
They're after my boyfriend! That way!

497
00:33:48.693 --> 00:33:50.820
- Hero practice won't hurt.
Please!

498
00:33:52.822 --> 00:33:53.781
Woo-hoo!

499
00:33:59.829 --> 00:34:00.663
Where is he?

500
00:34:08.046 --> 00:34:08.921
Move! Move!

501
00:34:17.513 --> 00:34:18.347
Yeah!

502
00:34:18.347 --> 00:34:20.266
What a mess.

503
00:34:23.728 --> 00:34:24.645
Whoa!

504
00:34:25.396 --> 00:34:26.522
George!
- Ah!

505
00:34:41.788 --> 00:34:45.708
Somebody's lost.

506
00:34:46.417 --> 00:34:48.669
Hey. girlie. did you take a wrong turn?

507
00:34:48.669 --> 00:34:51.964
You don't remember me from the cemetery?
You messed with my people.

508
00:34:52.673 --> 00:34:54.592
And your boss killed my mom.

509
00:34:54.592 --> 00:34:57.095
We work for an intergalactic war criminal.

510
00:34:57.095 --> 00:34:59.097
You'll need to be a lot more specific.

511
00:35:00.223 --> 00:35:03.101
I'm Minh Kwan. And you're about to face

512
00:35:03.976 --> 00:35:05.478
the Sabertooth Tiger!

513
00:35:06.854 --> 00:35:10.233
- Wha--? I'm doing the world a favor.

514
00:35:10.942 --> 00:35:12.735
- Sabertooth Tiger!

515
00:35:12.735 --> 00:35:14.987
Now. what do we have here?

516
00:35:14.987 --> 00:35:17.573
Another kid playing the hero.

517
00:35:18.074 --> 00:35:20.576
I tend to make that difficult.

518
00:35:20.576 --> 00:35:22.411
Ask your mom.

519
00:35:23.246 --> 00:35:26.582
If I can't morph. then I'll take you down
the old-fashioned way.

520
00:35:39.679 --> 00:35:42.473
Praying Mantis style. Just like Trini.

521
00:35:43.683 --> 00:35:46.894
Tell me. child.

522
00:35:46.894 --> 00:35:50.731
Does being squashed like a bug
run in the family?

523
00:36:02.702 --> 00:36:07.582
Playtime's over.

524
00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:29.854
Whoa.

525
00:36:31.522 --> 00:36:35.067
Well. it looks like
we've got Rita's little science project

526
00:36:35.067 --> 00:36:36.319
all to ourselves now.

527
00:36:36.903 --> 00:36:40.072
Perhaps. Our distraction might've worked
for now. but it's not gonna last long.

528
00:36:40.656 --> 00:36:41.824
Oh man.

529
00:36:41.824 --> 00:36:44.577
They got a lot more Rangers
than I expected.

530
00:36:45.828 --> 00:36:48.289
- Snizzard is a piece of work.

531
00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:52.001
Tommy. look at you.

532
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:54.587
Kat. No.

533
00:36:56.339 --> 00:36:59.884
- Snizzard created these snakes.
What does your scanner say?

534
00:36:59.884 --> 00:37:03.596
My readings show that their energy
is connected to our friends.

535
00:37:04.597 --> 00:37:06.349
If we don't destroy that monster.

536
00:37:06.349 --> 00:37:08.643
we can't move any of them
without causing them harm.

537
00:37:08.643 --> 00:37:10.770
- So back to the junkyard or... ?
- What is that?

538
00:37:13.856 --> 00:37:14.690
Oh no.

539
00:37:16.317 --> 00:37:17.610
That's what she's been up to.

540
00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:21.239
Is that some kind of space barrel?

541
00:37:21.781 --> 00:37:23.658
No. it's. uh... it's a space dumpster.

542
00:37:24.742 --> 00:37:26.410
Rita's creating a time portal.

543
00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:29.872
- That's what she came out of when we--
- Yes. when Zordon recruited us.

544
00:37:29.872 --> 00:37:32.208
So Rita's trying to contact
her younger self.

545
00:37:33.125 --> 00:37:34.001
But why?

546
00:37:34.001 --> 00:37:36.963
Why? So many reasons.

547
00:37:36.963 --> 00:37:40.007
- What? Minh! Are you okay?

548
00:37:40.007 --> 00:37:44.387
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
- Shush. The adults are talking.

549
00:37:44.387 --> 00:37:50.059
Have you figured it out. Billy?
Or has my genius surpassed even you?

550
00:37:50.059 --> 00:37:52.979
Let me guess. A Rita reunion

551
00:37:52.979 --> 00:37:55.439
and then some scheme
to conquer the galaxy?

552
00:37:55.439 --> 00:37:56.565
Not bad.

553
00:37:56.565 --> 00:38:01.779
I'll pass through this portal and give
years of knowledge to my younger self.

554
00:38:01.779 --> 00:38:05.283
making us absolutely unstoppable.

555
00:38:05.283 --> 00:38:09.453
We'll kill your do-gooding teenage selves
in their sleep

556
00:38:09.453 --> 00:38:13.374
before Zordon even thinks
to make you Rangers.

557
00:38:13.374 --> 00:38:17.461
You think you can rewrite 30 years
of history with some tin-pot gadget?

558
00:38:17.461 --> 00:38:18.379
Careful.

559
00:38:18.379 --> 00:38:22.591
Your friends are charging my machine
faster than I could have dreamed.

560
00:38:22.591 --> 00:38:25.428
so I don't need you anymore.

561
00:38:25.428 --> 00:38:27.638
I'll take out Snizzard.
You get the others.

562
00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:31.892
You know. your mom
will be a first for me. Minh.

563
00:38:31.892 --> 00:38:34.729
I've never killed anyone twice before.

564
00:38:34.729 --> 00:38:36.063
Hold that thought.

565
00:38:37.398 --> 00:38:40.609
Yah!

566
00:38:53.414 --> 00:38:54.749
Yes.

567
00:38:56.834 --> 00:38:58.002
Stop that.

568
00:39:01.422 --> 00:39:03.716
Oh. Cranston.

569
00:39:05.134 --> 00:39:07.386
What a waste!

570
00:39:08.346 --> 00:39:10.890
Trini died for you.

571
00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:14.518
And now you'll share her fate.

572
00:39:20.232 --> 00:39:21.192
No!

573
00:39:26.781 --> 00:39:28.407
No!
Minh!

574
00:39:32.036 --> 00:39:33.245
Minh!

575
00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:35.539
Yes. yes.

576
00:39:36.165 --> 00:39:38.250
This brings back memories.

577
00:39:39.001 --> 00:39:40.252
Minh?

578
00:39:46.467 --> 00:39:48.135
Oh. please. no.

579
00:39:49.345 --> 00:39:51.764
What a tragedy.

580
00:39:51.764 --> 00:39:54.266
That's what being selfless gets you.

581
00:40:02.233 --> 00:40:04.485
Minh. can you hear us?

582
00:40:05.361 --> 00:40:06.195
Minh?

583
00:40:11.367 --> 00:40:12.243
<i>Hi-ya!</i>

584
00:40:14.286 --> 00:40:17.039
<i>Ya!</i>

585
00:40:21.627 --> 00:40:22.670
Mom?

586
00:40:24.588 --> 00:40:27.550
I saw--
Oh. thank goodness.

587
00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:28.551
No way.

588
00:40:29.135 --> 00:40:30.678
What is this?

589
00:40:34.723 --> 00:40:37.101
- You know what this means. right?
- Go on.

590
00:40:37.935 --> 00:40:38.936
You wanna say it?

591
00:40:39.854 --> 00:40:40.938
Are you kidding?

592
00:40:45.151 --> 00:40:46.610
It's morphin' time!

593
00:40:47.903 --> 00:40:49.071
Mastodon!

594
00:40:49.071 --> 00:40:50.364
Pterodactyl!

595
00:40:50.364 --> 00:40:51.657
Triceratops!

596
00:40:51.657 --> 00:40:52.908
Sabertooth Tiger!

597
00:40:52.908 --> 00:40:54.243
Tyrannosaurus!

598
00:40:55.828 --> 00:40:56.954
Power Rangers!

599
00:40:57.621 --> 00:40:59.582
Whoa. it actually worked.

600
00:40:59.582 --> 00:41:02.042
You're a Ranger.
A legit Ranger.

601
00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:04.545
Putties. surround them.

602
00:41:09.675 --> 00:41:11.510
Time for phase three of the plan.

603
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:12.970
Did we plan a phase three?

604
00:41:13.596 --> 00:41:16.307
Let me guess.
Phase three is laying the smackdown?

605
00:41:16.307 --> 00:41:17.391
Precisely.

606
00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:19.101
Bring it.

607
00:41:20.895 --> 00:41:24.148
Maybe watching you die
will cure my headache.

608
00:41:28.068 --> 00:41:31.489
Coming through.

609
00:41:33.324 --> 00:41:34.158
Love it.

610
00:42:02.311 --> 00:42:04.188
Kat. you're clear.
- Thanks. Rock.

611
00:42:04.188 --> 00:42:07.691
Uh. uh. uh. Think twice.

612
00:42:07.691 --> 00:42:10.861
You don't want to hurt
your tiny little friends.

613
00:42:10.861 --> 00:42:13.364
She's right. To free them.
we have to destroy Snizzard.

614
00:42:13.948 --> 00:42:15.908
Good luck with that.

615
00:42:16.825 --> 00:42:21.330
My queen. I don't understand.

616
00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:23.749
What did I do?

617
00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:30.798
Magic wand.
make my monster grow!

618
00:42:31.465 --> 00:42:34.009
Oh!

619
00:42:36.804 --> 00:42:39.807
Arise. Snizzard!

620
00:42:43.185 --> 00:42:44.979
She's distracted.

621
00:42:44.979 --> 00:42:47.898
Let's see them try to--

622
00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:55.030
That's enough out of her.

623
00:42:58.826 --> 00:43:00.369
Boss? No!

624
00:43:00.369 --> 00:43:03.289
One problem down.
Can you handle that hairy bot?

625
00:43:03.872 --> 00:43:06.083
Oh. easy.

626
00:43:06.083 --> 00:43:09.211
- Anything I can do?
- You're with me. We're going big.

627
00:43:09.712 --> 00:43:11.839
Alpha. we need Dinozord power. Now.

628
00:43:11.839 --> 00:43:13.215
You got it. Billy.

629
00:43:30.899 --> 00:43:37.781
Okay. Transmaterializing Zords
to lunar surface in three. two. one.

630
00:43:45.289 --> 00:43:47.374
Hold on. Minh. Time for battle mode.

631
00:43:51.712 --> 00:43:52.588
Whoa!

632
00:44:02.723 --> 00:44:05.434
So how the heck do you drive this thing?

633
00:44:06.018 --> 00:44:06.977
Do what I do.

634
00:44:06.977 --> 00:44:09.480
- You'll find it's second nature.
Okay.

635
00:44:10.606 --> 00:44:11.649
Here he comes.

636
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:34.546
Now. this is the coolest.

637
00:44:34.546 --> 00:44:37.007
All right. you big lizard.
Come catch these hands.

638
00:44:46.016 --> 00:44:48.060
- Direct hit.
- Whoo!

639
00:44:50.771 --> 00:44:52.106
Don't let up.

640
00:44:52.106 --> 00:44:56.360
So you're fighting dirty.

641
00:44:56.944 --> 00:44:57.778
Yes!

642
00:44:58.278 --> 00:45:00.823
Come on.

643
00:45:02.449 --> 00:45:03.534
My club!

644
00:45:06.954 --> 00:45:08.330
Rocky. now!

645
00:45:15.546 --> 00:45:17.589
- Got him.
I'm not gonna lie. Rocky.

646
00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:20.092
That was... pretty hardcore.

647
00:45:20.092 --> 00:45:21.885
Well. beef is off the menu.

648
00:45:22.928 --> 00:45:24.596
Billy. how's the reptile?

649
00:45:24.596 --> 00:45:28.392
As cold-blooded as ever.
But we have room for three more in here.

650
00:45:28.392 --> 00:45:29.560
Copy that.

651
00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:31.895
So it's just me left.

652
00:45:31.895 --> 00:45:34.898
Good. I'll have you all to myself.

653
00:45:36.108 --> 00:45:37.151
Oh yeah.

654
00:45:37.151 --> 00:45:39.945
- I have been looking forward to this.
Together.

655
00:45:44.491 --> 00:45:50.330
Shattered circuits
can't keep a bad witch down.

656
00:45:59.882 --> 00:46:02.968
Heads up. He's still coming.

657
00:46:05.804 --> 00:46:08.182
Tails. You lose.

658
00:46:08.766 --> 00:46:14.271
They thought they could stop me.
but my masterpiece is fully charged.

659
00:46:14.855 --> 00:46:19.318
Finally. I can rule
with my younger. prettier self.

660
00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:22.654
I can't wait to see me again.

661
00:46:27.159 --> 00:46:29.787
Can we get
this thing on its feet?

662
00:46:29.787 --> 00:46:31.163
Is that what I think it is?

663
00:46:32.206 --> 00:46:33.707
Oh. great. the portal.

664
00:46:33.707 --> 00:46:34.958
We gotta move.

665
00:46:34.958 --> 00:46:37.961
System's back online.
Just have to-- There.

666
00:46:38.837 --> 00:46:39.797
Up we go.

667
00:46:42.841 --> 00:46:45.177
Mega Power Sword. Now!

668
00:46:51.975 --> 00:46:56.438
Now they will come.
and then she will be free.

669
00:46:56.438 --> 00:46:59.191
My past and my future.

670
00:47:00.692 --> 00:47:03.028
<i>It looks like a giant space dumpster.</i>

671
00:47:03.028 --> 00:47:04.613
<i>Let's open her up.</i>

672
00:47:04.613 --> 00:47:09.827
Yes. yes!

673
00:47:10.828 --> 00:47:14.081
And so it begins.

674
00:47:14.081 --> 00:47:15.958
What do you think?
Time to end this?

675
00:47:15.958 --> 00:47:17.251
Oh. definitely.

676
00:47:18.502 --> 00:47:19.586
Yeah!

677
00:47:27.553 --> 00:47:31.640
My circuits. they burn!

678
00:47:35.185 --> 00:47:37.437
Oof! What a way to go.

679
00:47:38.021 --> 00:47:41.483
No. my Snizzard. And my snakes.

680
00:47:41.483 --> 00:47:47.531
But no matter.
the Rita renaissance begins!

681
00:47:48.323 --> 00:47:53.036
<i>Ah! After ten thousand years. I'm free!</i>

682
00:47:54.162 --> 00:47:55.664
Sit down. Shut up!

683
00:47:55.664 --> 00:47:56.707
Huh?

684
00:47:58.876 --> 00:48:01.044
Rocky. get the other Rangers. Quick.

685
00:48:01.044 --> 00:48:02.212
Right behind you.

686
00:48:02.212 --> 00:48:04.214
- Take the shot. Kat.
- What?

687
00:48:04.214 --> 00:48:06.133
With pleasure.

688
00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:10.679
<i>Time to conquer Ea--</i>

689
00:48:10.679 --> 00:48:12.639
I'll kill you all!

690
00:48:12.639 --> 00:48:14.600
Shut her down. Do it. Zack.

691
00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:16.018
This is for Trini.

692
00:48:22.274 --> 00:48:24.651
Is that it? Is she gone?

693
00:48:25.235 --> 00:48:27.738
Affirmative. It's over.

694
00:48:28.697 --> 00:48:32.284
Like I said. Minh.
we always save the world.

695
00:48:33.076 --> 00:48:36.163
You missed all the action.
but I'm glad you made it.

696
00:48:36.663 --> 00:48:40.500
All the rescued Rangers
are secure in your spaceship's med bay

697
00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:42.377
and in stable condition.

698
00:48:42.377 --> 00:48:45.005
Well. our course for Aquitar is all set.

699
00:48:45.005 --> 00:48:47.466
The Aquitians will fix them up in no time.

700
00:48:47.466 --> 00:48:49.593
You sure you don't wanna join us. Billy?

701
00:48:49.593 --> 00:48:52.054
You know. uh.
Cestria did say she missed you.

702
00:48:52.054 --> 00:48:54.932
No. But I'll be there soon.

703
00:48:54.932 --> 00:48:57.059
I still have some company matters
that I gotta tie up

704
00:48:57.059 --> 00:48:59.478
before I can get back
to my old adventures.

705
00:48:59.478 --> 00:49:02.064
Look at you.
You've missed the travel. haven't you?

706
00:49:02.564 --> 00:49:04.483
It is nice
to have something new to focus on.

707
00:49:05.067 --> 00:49:08.862
But once the Aquitians get everyone
back to normal size and back in action.

708
00:49:08.862 --> 00:49:10.405
all of this will be over.

709
00:49:10.405 --> 00:49:14.201
Yeah. it's been a wild ride.
but I'm ready to get back to JJ.

710
00:49:14.201 --> 00:49:18.705
Being a parent is almost as challenging
as being a Ranger.

711
00:49:18.705 --> 00:49:21.208
You think that's tough?
I didn't even get lunch.

712
00:49:21.208 --> 00:49:24.836
- Somebody threw out my noodles.
- Sorry. sorry.

713
00:49:25.545 --> 00:49:28.173
Relax. Relax. Don't blow a circuit.
I'm just kidding.

714
00:49:28.173 --> 00:49:29.800
Even though they're small.

715
00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.177
we shouldn't keep
our fellow Rangers waiting.

716
00:49:32.928 --> 00:49:34.221
It was great catching up.

717
00:49:37.808 --> 00:49:41.144
I'm glad the Sabertooth Tiger legacy
is in great hands.

718
00:49:42.104 --> 00:49:43.063
It's an honor.

719
00:49:44.314 --> 00:49:46.441
Time to fire up the teleporter?

720
00:49:46.441 --> 00:49:49.319
- Yeah.
Sounds good. Let's go. Rocky.

721
00:49:49.319 --> 00:49:51.780
Inputting all of your coordinates now.

722
00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:55.158
Until next time.
may the power protect you all.

723
00:49:55.784 --> 00:49:56.702
And you.

724
00:50:00.288 --> 00:50:02.416
So what do you think
of your communicator?

725
00:50:03.667 --> 00:50:05.043
Love the vintage aesthetic.

726
00:50:05.752 --> 00:50:08.714
And if I'm late for class.
teleporting will be clutch.

727
00:50:08.714 --> 00:50:11.133
Uh. only if no one's looking. okay?

728
00:50:11.133 --> 00:50:12.759
- Okay.

729
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:15.929
Look at this place.
I mean. it's as if nothing's changed.

730
00:50:15.929 --> 00:50:18.223
It's just a little bit...
I don't know. smaller. maybe.

731
00:50:19.224 --> 00:50:20.225
Maybe we've grown.

732
00:50:21.643 --> 00:50:25.522
You two want smoothies? I wanna know
if they still have Ernie's recipe.

733
00:50:25.522 --> 00:50:26.982
Sure.
- Sure.

734
00:50:30.777 --> 00:50:34.573
Can I get you anything while I'm away?
A souvenir from Mirinoi. maybe.

735
00:50:34.573 --> 00:50:35.949
I don't know.

736
00:50:37.284 --> 00:50:39.161
You won't be gone too long. will you?

737
00:50:39.828 --> 00:50:42.330
Mom always said she missed you
when you were in space.

738
00:50:43.665 --> 00:50:45.917
I mean. I'll miss you and...

739
00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:49.254
Um...

740
00:50:50.505 --> 00:50:51.339
Minh?

741
00:50:52.466 --> 00:50:54.259
It's just. before you go.

742
00:50:56.053 --> 00:50:57.304
all that stuff...

743
00:50:59.556 --> 00:51:00.557
Mom's passing.

744
00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:04.853
I said it was your fault.
and that wasn't fair.

745
00:51:06.354 --> 00:51:10.984
You couldn't have known what would happen
to Rita or what would happen to Mom.

746
00:51:14.321 --> 00:51:17.949
You didn't say anything about me
I haven't told myself a million times.

747
00:51:19.576 --> 00:51:21.953
No. but for real.
I should be thanking you.

748
00:51:23.413 --> 00:51:26.124
If you hadn't pushed Zack
to share the truth about Mom...

749
00:51:28.293 --> 00:51:30.712
I don't know
how I would have handled everything.

750
00:51:33.882 --> 00:51:34.841
You're a good kid.

751
00:51:35.801 --> 00:51:37.302
We're all looking out for you.

752
00:51:37.886 --> 00:51:40.138
And I'm really glad
you looked out for me too.

753
00:51:40.138 --> 00:51:41.848
You mean Rita's blast?

754
00:51:42.641 --> 00:51:43.683
I had to.

755
00:51:44.601 --> 00:51:45.560
You're family.

756
00:51:46.394 --> 00:51:47.729
Gotta protect your family.

757
00:51:49.856 --> 00:51:50.690
Family. huh?

758
00:51:52.734 --> 00:51:55.195
Is that why you thought it was okay
to borrow my flying car?

759
00:51:55.195 --> 00:51:57.489
Okay. that was Ranger business.

760
00:51:57.489 --> 00:51:58.824
Ah.

761
00:51:58.824 --> 00:52:01.993
I'm sorry. The Radbug
is proprietary technology.

762
00:52:02.577 --> 00:52:05.455
- You're grounded.
You think you can ground me?

763
00:52:05.956 --> 00:52:07.541
No. it doesn't work like that.

764
00:52:07.541 --> 00:52:09.960
- You're grounded.
- Look at you two.

765
00:52:10.752 --> 00:52:11.795
Oh man.

766
00:52:15.757 --> 00:52:16.883
She's so much like...

767
00:52:20.595 --> 00:52:22.013
Trini would be proud.

768
00:52:25.684 --> 00:52:26.768
You just reminded me.

769
00:52:27.561 --> 00:52:29.229
After Rita blasted me.

770
00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:31.898
I got a weird flash.

771
00:52:33.984 --> 00:52:35.277
These memories.

772
00:52:35.277 --> 00:52:36.361
Memories?

773
00:52:36.361 --> 00:52:38.155
Yeah. from the Morpher.

774
00:52:38.864 --> 00:52:40.615
Of you and Mom being Rangers.

775
00:52:41.992 --> 00:52:43.201
Being heroes.

776
00:52:43.785 --> 00:52:45.495
I mean. it's in optimal condition.

777
00:52:45.495 --> 00:52:47.706
Nothing out of the ordinary.
but who knows?

778
00:52:48.415 --> 00:52:51.293
The morphing grid
is a pathway to infinite possibilities.

779
00:52:51.835 --> 00:52:54.504
Maybe I shouldn't give up on Zordon.

780
00:52:55.547 --> 00:52:56.840
What were the memories like?

781
00:52:58.383 --> 00:52:59.384
It was weird. I--

782
00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:01.136
It was like

783
00:53:02.012 --> 00:53:04.055
I felt how much all of you meant to her.

784
00:53:05.599 --> 00:53:07.350
She meant a lot to us too.

785
00:53:08.059 --> 00:53:10.353
She was... a great friend.

786
00:53:10.937 --> 00:53:11.771
The best.

787
00:53:12.522 --> 00:53:13.356
The best.

788
00:53:14.608 --> 00:53:17.110
I wouldn't even be here
if she didn't overcome her fear of heights

789
00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:19.029
and get me out
of a really nasty cliffhanger.

790
00:53:19.029 --> 00:53:21.156
Mom was afraid of heights?

791
00:53:22.365 --> 00:53:24.201
Okay. What else didn't she tell me?

792
00:53:25.118 --> 00:53:27.954
That time Shellshock made her run.
and she couldn't stop.

793
00:53:27.954 --> 00:53:30.123
The weirdo
with the traffic light on his back?

794
00:53:30.123 --> 00:53:31.875
A traffic-light man?

795
00:53:31.875 --> 00:53:34.211
No. it wasn't a man. It was a turtle.

796
00:53:34.211 --> 00:53:35.962
- A turtle?

797
00:53:35.962 --> 00:53:38.381
- We have to tell her everything.
- Oh my goodness.

798
00:53:38.381 --> 00:53:40.467
It was a turtle.
