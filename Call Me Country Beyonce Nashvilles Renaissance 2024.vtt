4
00:00:11.302 --> 00:00:16.725
- Beyoncé is the greatest
entertainer of her generation.

5
00:00:16.808 --> 00:00:20.979
This is a person who
has a very intense

6
00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:25.150
relationship with a
very large body of fans.

7
00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:27.152
- You went to the
concert. and you

8
00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:28.445
saw the concert filmed. right?

9
00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:32.073
Three hours. yes. well-spent.

10
00:00:32.156 --> 00:00:36.161
- (SINGING) I wanna house
you and make you take my name

11
00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:39.122
I've met so many of
my goals. and I just

12
00:00:39.164 --> 00:00:42.250
keep making new goals
because I'm never satisfied.

13
00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:44.627
and I always want to grow.

14
00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:46.504
- Well. the highly
anticipated second act

15
00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:49.299
to Beyoncé's Renaissance
project. Cowboy Carter.

16
00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:50.425
dropped last night.

17
00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:55.638
- You guys. oh. my god.

18
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.307
- I'm crying.

19
00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:59.976
- She's the first Black woman
ever to top the Billboard's

20
00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:01.561
Hot Country Songs chart.

21
00:01:01.644 --> 00:01:04.897
- There is a public
perception about country music

22
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.776
that it is a
predominantly white genre.

23
00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:09.486
- I mean. I've seen
people say things like.

24
00:01:09.527 --> 00:01:11.321
I didn't know that there
were Black country singers.

25
00:01:11.363 --> 00:01:14.783
- It's kind of an industry
that takes care of its own.

26
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:17.660
- It has not been a
genre that has been

27
00:01:17.702 --> 00:01:20.372
accepting of Black people.

28
00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:23.291
- You often find
partisans of country music

29
00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:26.378
saying. well. this is
or that ain't country.

30
00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:30.548
- Beyoncé. honey.
you need to stop.

31
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.717
- How is that supposed
to be country?

32
00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.011
- That Beyoncé
bullshit country song?

33
00:01:35.053 --> 00:01:36.888
[scoffs] Bitch. please.

34
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.723
- I think. pretty
clearly. what Beyoncé

35
00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:43.520
is trying to do is shove open
a door for other Black artists.

36
00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:45.646
- When I heard "16 Carriages--"

37
00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.402
- (SINGING) 16 carriages
driving away while I watch them

38
00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:53.238
- --I was like. it has begun.

39
00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:55.073
[laughs]

40
00:01:55.156 --> 00:02:02.122
[music playing]

41
00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:04.958
- We love Beyoncé!

42
00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:06.876
- Beyoncé doesn't
do anything small.

43
00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:10.338
When she releases
an album. she rolls

44
00:02:10.422 --> 00:02:13.008
it out and invites the world.

45
00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:19.097
- This is the greatest rollout
moment of an album ever.

46
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.768
Beyoncé does a commercial
on the Super Bowl.

47
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.228
- The network is
crazy powerful.

48
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.271
I bet you can't break that.

49
00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:28.356
- [laughs] I bet I can.

50
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.733
- Wait. what?

51
00:02:29.774 --> 00:02:32.027
- All of America is
already watching.

52
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.945
- The whole crux of
the Verizon commercial

53
00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:36.281
is. look at all
the ways that I've

54
00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:37.866
already broken the internet.

55
00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:39.784
Look at all the things
that I can do that people

56
00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.786
will lose their minds over--

57
00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:43.579
because I'm Beyoncé.

58
00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:44.664
- What if I run for president?

59
00:02:44.748 --> 00:02:45.707
What if I'm an alien?

60
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:46.708
What if I'm an astronaut?

61
00:02:46.791 --> 00:02:48.251
We can handle anything.

62
00:02:48.293 --> 00:02:49.543
And then she says--

63
00:02:49.627 --> 00:02:50.628
- OK. they ready.

64
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.963
Drop the new music.

65
00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:53.465
- Fuck the game!

66
00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:54.966
What?

67
00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:56.134
What is she talking about.
where is this-- what?

68
00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:57.552
Did she just say that?

69
00:02:57.635 --> 00:02:58.970
Did it really mean--
is there new music?

70
00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:00.889
- I was not even
watching the Super Bowl.

71
00:03:00.972 --> 00:03:03.933
I was at a performance
for a friend

72
00:03:03.975 --> 00:03:06.061
and had turned my phone off.

73
00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:07.729
And as soon as I
got in my car. you

74
00:03:07.812 --> 00:03:10.148
would have thought someone
had died because there

75
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.983
were like 50 messages.

76
00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:13.026
Have you heard it?

77
00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.779
Did you see it?

78
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.655
- Part of the excitement
with Cowboy Carter

79
00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:22.327
was the suggestion that this
would be a country album.

80
00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:23.661
The fans are like. yes!

81
00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:24.621
Let's go.

82
00:03:24.662 --> 00:03:25.622
We want this.

83
00:03:25.663 --> 00:03:26.998
They love this.

84
00:03:27.082 --> 00:03:30.251
- (SINGING) family live
and died in America

85
00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:32.504
Good ole USA. good ole USA

86
00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:35.423
Shit. whole lotta red
in that white and blue

87
00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:39.135
- I mean. there's so much
red in the white and blue?

88
00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:42.305
It's. you know. the violence
that Black and Brown people

89
00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:47.352
have experienced being in
America. but not so overt

90
00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:49.062
that it's a protest song.

91
00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:52.524
We're just saying.
America. we have a problem.

92
00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:56.778
Cowboy Carter is
a political album.

93
00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:59.280
placing herself in
country. where we're

94
00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:03.201
not supposed to feel welcome.

95
00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:06.996
- It's really finna get real
because you have to acknowledge

96
00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:08.873
her gift and her
talent. and then

97
00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:13.628
she's bringing that to a genre
that is not used to change.

98
00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:19.300
[guitar playing]

99
00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:21.886
My love for country
music began--

100
00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:24.806
man. I was probably about
knee-high to a grasshopper--

101
00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:25.724
put it that way.

102
00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:27.225
I was real little.

103
00:04:27.308 --> 00:04:28.560
It just came out as.
like. I was soaked in it.

104
00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:29.644
You know what I'm saying?

105
00:04:29.728 --> 00:04:32.063
[laughs]

106
00:04:32.147 --> 00:04:37.902
(SINGING) Leading
my way like Sinatra

107
00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:43.950
And on a bad day.
yeah. I got a mantra

108
00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:46.828
Be original. be yourself

109
00:04:46.911 --> 00:04:49.330
Don't worry about anyone else

110
00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:51.416
I grew up in
Mississippi on a farm.

111
00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:53.084
born the son of a preacher.

112
00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:55.378
My granddad was a truck
driver and farmer.

113
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.881
And the backyard was 100 acres.

114
00:04:57.922 --> 00:05:01.426
They had Duroc hogs. blue
turkey. 110 head of chickens.

115
00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:03.928
whiskey stills down
off in the bottom.

116
00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:05.722
[laughs]

117
00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:08.308
(SINGING) Now. every
show is sold out

118
00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:14.105
To me. I didn't see country as
a color. but other people did.

119
00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:15.607
(SINGING) You say
you want a country

120
00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:17.025
Well. country is
what I'm playing

121
00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:22.322
There's no doubt.
I can hold out

122
00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:24.115
- Aaron has been doing
this for a very long time.

123
00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.618
He's one of those people where
it's long overdue for him

124
00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:33.875
to see the success
that he deserves.

125
00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.006
- I have a buddy.

126
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.508
He said. Aaron. I want
you to meet this guy.

127
00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:42.967
He was an artist.

128
00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:45.387
He plays at the Grand
Ole Opry and everything.

129
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:46.846
I ain't going to drop no names.

130
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.224
So I asked him where he
was from. and he's

131
00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:50.725
like. California.

132
00:05:50.808 --> 00:05:52.352
And I said. all right.
I'm from Mississippi.

133
00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:53.770
And he's like. so
what do you do?

134
00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:55.146
Rap?

135
00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:57.565
And I was like. whoa. he
went for the sweet move.

136
00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:00.652
And I'm like. nah. bro.
I do traditional country.

137
00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:02.153
And it was-- and that was it.

138
00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:04.614
He didn't say too much.
and he just walked off.

139
00:06:04.656 --> 00:06:08.159
Yeah. so. he's a
white country artist.

140
00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:09.953
and he has all
this opportunity.

141
00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:12.497
And look at his attitude
towards somebody he don't know.

142
00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.290
and he just seen a color.

143
00:06:14.332 --> 00:06:16.501
So that gave me more
fire to keep doing me.

144
00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:19.129
keep writing what I write.
keep living my life.

145
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.964
and don't worry about
artists like that.

146
00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:22.924
Because artists like that
got it made in the shade.

147
00:06:23.008 --> 00:06:27.512
I ain't got it
made in the shade.

148
00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:29.305
- The country
music industry has

149
00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:35.687
not done any work to make Black
people feel safe in the music.

150
00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:40.525
We have just been
so overlooked.

151
00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:43.236
- You cannot be scared of
what country looks like.

152
00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:45.488
Country ain't
never been a color.

153
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:52.037
When I first heard the two
singles drop. I was like. uh.

154
00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:53.580
shit. that's country.

155
00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:54.706
[laughs]

156
00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:56.166
(SINGING) 16 car--

157
00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:59.377
Man. what?

158
00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:01.796
- I have always
felt that Beyoncé

159
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.551
has a sort of
national personality

160
00:07:06.634 --> 00:07:13.058
where everybody can see
themselves reflected.

161
00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:15.352
- (SINGING) Say my
name. say my name

162
00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:17.812
When no one is around you

163
00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:20.148
- Beyoncé obviously
coming out of Destiny's

164
00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:22.067
Child. an R&B girl group.

165
00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:24.903
- (SINGING) Uh-oh.
uh-oh. uh-oh. oh. no. no

166
00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:28.198
- The solo career
starts. psh. explodes.

167
00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:30.158
- (SINGING) Get me bodied

168
00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:34.329
- She's somebody who has never
really been beholden to genre

169
00:07:34.412 --> 00:07:36.331
in a way that was
limiting to her.

170
00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:38.917
whether that be pop. whether
that be R&B. She seems

171
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.335
to move to the next thing.

172
00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:42.253
- (SINGING) To the
left. to the left

173
00:07:42.337 --> 00:07:44.130
I write the songs
that I need to hear.

174
00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:46.007
and that I feel other
women need to hear.

175
00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:50.220
And I'm all about empowerment
and the strength that we have

176
00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:52.305
when we unite as women.

177
00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:54.224
- Beyoncé had come to
be seen as an artist

178
00:07:54.265 --> 00:07:57.394
for everyone. someone
that a lot of white women

179
00:07:57.435 --> 00:07:58.978
could gravitate towards.

180
00:07:59.062 --> 00:08:02.607
- I've kind of broken
barriers. and I don't think

181
00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:05.610
people think about my race.

182
00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:11.574
I think they look at me as an
entertainer and a musician.

183
00:08:11.616 --> 00:08:12.701
- She would do
all of the things

184
00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:16.996
that a pop star has to do.

185
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.915
But when she moves
into Lemonade.

186
00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:21.167
she moves into the space
where she is reflecting

187
00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:23.169
a world that she wants to see.

188
00:08:23.253 --> 00:08:26.131
- This is a woman who shouted
out the Black Panthers

189
00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:27.507
at the Super Bowl.

190
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.260
- It is a notion of.
"we have arrived.

191
00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:32.636
and we're taking up space.
and we're not going to ask you

192
00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:34.931
for permission to do that."

193
00:08:34.972 --> 00:08:37.726
I think "Formation" was
really one of the first times

194
00:08:37.808 --> 00:08:39.561
that people had to
stop and be like.

195
00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:41.479
oh. maybe this isn't for me.

196
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.313
The "Formation" video came
out at a time when there was

197
00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:45.483
so much commentary
happening around the Black

198
00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:47.318
Lives Matter movement.

199
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.113
We have her singing about how
much she loves her Negro nose

200
00:08:50.155 --> 00:08:51.823
and her Jackson 5 nostrils.

201
00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:55.994
- (SINGING) I like my Negro
nose with Jackson 5 nostrils

202
00:08:56.036 --> 00:08:57.662
- These are choices
that Beyoncé

203
00:08:57.746 --> 00:09:02.751
is making that relate to her
own maturation as a

204
00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:05.337
human being.

205
00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:07.505
- Trayvon did not have to die.

206
00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:09.591
We all know the reason why.

207
00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:11.468
- Looking at the way
Black people are treated

208
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:15.388
and standing up for women who
have been wronged by society.

209
00:09:15.472 --> 00:09:19.309
- There was a time when a
woman's opinion did not matter.

210
00:09:19.351 --> 00:09:25.065
If you were Black. white.
Mexican. Asian. Muslim.

211
00:09:25.148 --> 00:09:29.527
educated. poor or rich.
if you were a woman.

212
00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:32.030
it did not matter.

213
00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:35.700
Look how far we've come
from having no voice.

214
00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:37.452
(SINGING) You
won't break my soul

215
00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:41.456
- Renaissance is about Black
women and queer people.

216
00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:45.835
and it is this
powerful upliftment.

217
00:09:45.877 --> 00:09:47.003
- I see you.

218
00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:48.046
I love you.

219
00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:50.465
I center you.

220
00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:53.134
And then she comes
with a country album.

221
00:09:53.218 --> 00:09:55.387
(SINGING) This
ain't Texas. woo!

222
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:56.888
Ain't no hold 'em

223
00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.891
- My banjo being on a
world recognized song

224
00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:01.726
is just kind of
blowing my mind.

225
00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:03.061
(SINGING) So park your Lexus

226
00:10:03.144 --> 00:10:04.688
- TikToks of Black
people dancing

227
00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:07.148
to the sound of my banjo?

228
00:10:07.232 --> 00:10:08.692
Stop.

229
00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:12.779
That banjo represents hundreds
of years of our history.

230
00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:14.531
whether people know it or not.

231
00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:17.909
[banjo playing]

232
00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:19.619
The banjo is an
instrument invented

233
00:10:19.703 --> 00:10:22.247
by people of the African
diaspora in the Caribbean.

234
00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:25.542
- Enslaved people brought
versions of the banjo

235
00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:28.211
to the United States
over on the ships.

236
00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:31.256
- And then it makes its way
up with them to North America

237
00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:35.385
and becomes a central
part of Black life.

238
00:10:35.427 --> 00:10:37.929
And there are loads of white
people playing music to it.

239
00:10:38.013 --> 00:10:40.598
- It took the
Scottish. the Africans.

240
00:10:40.682 --> 00:10:43.268
Native American people
to come together.

241
00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:45.437
I'm going to borrow this.
and I'm going to borrow this.

242
00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.771
and I'm going to borrow this.

243
00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:48.273
And like. it's like gumbo.

244
00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:51.026
- What happens. then.
is a couple of things.

245
00:10:51.109 --> 00:10:53.361
You have the great migration.
a lot of Black people

246
00:10:53.445 --> 00:10:56.781
leaving the South. and then
you also have the recording

247
00:10:56.865 --> 00:11:00.410
industry coming in.

248
00:11:00.452 --> 00:11:03.872
They're wanting to sell
music to certain people.

249
00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:05.540
- What was called
"hillbilly music"

250
00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:08.251
in the 1920s and what
were called "race records"

251
00:11:08.293 --> 00:11:10.128
around the same time
was basically code

252
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.881
for a certain brand of
white music and a certain

253
00:11:12.964 --> 00:11:14.299
brand of Black music.

254
00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:16.343
Eventually. race
records evolved

255
00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:17.969
into what's known
as rhythm and blues

256
00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:22.766
or R&B. What's known as
hillbilly became country.

257
00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:26.811
- It was like the ultimate
capitalist decision

258
00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:28.563
to split these things in half.

259
00:11:28.646 --> 00:11:31.191
- They create the
segregation. and then we

260
00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:35.195
have perpetuated it as the
music industry has grown.

261
00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:37.113
This is not like.
oh. Black people

262
00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:38.990
are getting into country--
no. no. no. no. no. no. no.

263
00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:40.784
Like. we've been in
country music. right?

264
00:11:40.825 --> 00:11:43.411
- You can go back to. like.
the first family of country

265
00:11:43.495 --> 00:11:45.163
music. the Carter Family.

266
00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:48.750
- (SINGING) Oh. he taught me to
love him and promised to love

267
00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:53.171
- Carter specifically had this
very distinct playing style.

268
00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:54.631
Well. it came from a Black man.

269
00:11:54.673 --> 00:11:55.965
It came from Lesley Riddle.

270
00:11:56.007 --> 00:11:57.509
And of course.
that historically

271
00:11:57.592 --> 00:12:00.178
has always been attributed
to Ma Carter. when

272
00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:02.013
that's actually Lesley Riddle.

273
00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:04.265
- I mean. one of the earliest
stars of the Grand Ole Opry

274
00:12:04.349 --> 00:12:07.977
in the 1920s was DeFord
Bailey. the so-called

275
00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:09.020
"harmonica wizard."

276
00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:11.731
[playing harmonica]

277
00:12:11.815 --> 00:12:13.525
- There were literally
Black artists

278
00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:16.111
there from the first night
that the Grand Ole Opry began.

279
00:12:16.194 --> 00:12:17.362
Linda Martell.

280
00:12:17.404 --> 00:12:21.282
- (SINGING)
Yoodle-la-di-eee-eee

281
00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:24.536
- She was the highest Black
woman to chart until Beyoncé.

282
00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:26.454
And this was in the late '60s.

283
00:12:26.538 --> 00:12:27.997
- Of course. Charley Pride.

284
00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:33.795
- (SINGING) We'll walk
the fields together

285
00:12:33.878 --> 00:12:37.590
- Charley Pride had 29
number ones on country radio.

286
00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:40.343
- He succeeded in spite of
the fact that he was Black.

287
00:12:40.385 --> 00:12:42.220
not because he was Black.
you know what I mean?

288
00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:44.973
- If you take Hank
Williams. Sr.. for example.

289
00:12:45.056 --> 00:12:47.392
he fused the blues
with country music.

290
00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:51.062
- (SINGING) I tried
so hard. my dear

291
00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:56.234
- So it has a very
inherently Black inspiration

292
00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:59.362
in our genre that happened with
the godfather of country music.

293
00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:01.906
So this started a
long. long time ago.

294
00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:04.034
It seemed to be that we've
gotten away from that

295
00:13:04.075 --> 00:13:07.412
somewhere along the way.

296
00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:09.539
- We have to remember
it is an industry.

297
00:13:09.581 --> 00:13:11.708
People who are in
power decided this is

298
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.293
what the Nashville sound is.

299
00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:16.629
- Nashville is the
gateway to country music.

300
00:13:16.713 --> 00:13:20.008
It is not only the center
of country the way.

301
00:13:20.091 --> 00:13:22.344
say. the movie and
television business

302
00:13:22.427 --> 00:13:23.803
is centered in Hollywood.

303
00:13:23.887 --> 00:13:28.099
It really is kind of the
arbiter of what country

304
00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:29.726
music is.

305
00:13:29.768 --> 00:13:33.563
There's no one faction that
controls Nashville wholly.

306
00:13:33.605 --> 00:13:37.776
but it's kind of an industry
that takes care of its own.

307
00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:40.945
- The idea that it only
happens in country music

308
00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:42.530
is a little misleading.

309
00:13:42.614 --> 00:13:45.367
There is definitely gatekeeping
happening in hip-hop.

310
00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:48.620
There's a ton of gatekeeping
that happens in jazz.

311
00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:50.246
- I think a lot of
people still think

312
00:13:50.288 --> 00:13:52.374
that this is like
a meritocracy.

313
00:13:52.457 --> 00:13:54.793
and that's absolutely not true.

314
00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:56.628
- Greed is driving the train.

315
00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.880
- Everyone has a boss.

316
00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:00.131
The bosses have bosses.

317
00:14:00.215 --> 00:14:01.925
The top bosses
have shareholders.

318
00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:04.969
There's this constant
chain of fear.

319
00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:11.101
which slows down progress.

320
00:14:11.142 --> 00:14:13.853
- The thing that they
know for sure how to do

321
00:14:13.937 --> 00:14:15.814
is to market white men.

322
00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:17.774
- The Mount Rushmore
of country today

323
00:14:17.816 --> 00:14:20.735
would be Morgan
Wallen. Luke Combs.

324
00:14:20.819 --> 00:14:24.698
Luke Bryan. Jason
Aldean. still be Kenny

325
00:14:24.781 --> 00:14:27.575
Chesney up there. Keith Urban.

326
00:14:27.659 --> 00:14:32.997
It's generally held by
label heads in Nashville

327
00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:37.085
that it's a bad bet to give a
contract to a female singer.

328
00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:38.837
- (SINGING) When
they bury our dreams

329
00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:41.881
We push them up
through concrete

330
00:14:41.965 --> 00:14:43.425
We're growing where--

331
00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:45.176
- I will never forget this.

332
00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:47.971
I'm sitting in the hallway at
a major label in Nashville.

333
00:14:48.013 --> 00:14:49.347
I can hear them
playing the music.

334
00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:51.307
And everything sounds
really positive.

335
00:14:51.349 --> 00:14:53.018
and everyone's laughing.
and they're talking.

336
00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:54.019
Oh. this sounds so pretty.

337
00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:55.103
Oh. it's good.

338
00:14:55.186 --> 00:14:56.855
Blah. blah. blah.

339
00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:59.482
And then. everybody peeks out
the window. and I'm like. hi.

340
00:14:59.524 --> 00:15:03.028
And then suddenly. you know.
suddenly it's like. oh. well.

341
00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:05.530
we got to figure out how
to find songs for someone

342
00:15:05.613 --> 00:15:06.823
like her.

343
00:15:06.865 --> 00:15:09.200
Let's tweak some
things with her accent.

344
00:15:09.284 --> 00:15:12.704
Maybe we need to figure out
how to build an audience

345
00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:14.289
for someone like her.

346
00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:15.915
- Black people have a hard
time in country music.

347
00:15:15.999 --> 00:15:17.834
Queer people have a hard
time in country music.

348
00:15:17.876 --> 00:15:21.379
But even white women have a
hard time in country music.

349
00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:23.631
- If you ask one
country radio executive.

350
00:15:23.715 --> 00:15:27.093
he says the key to success
is leaving the women out.

351
00:15:27.177 --> 00:15:29.179
- Tomato gate is
a flare-up that

352
00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.474
happened when a
radio programmer

353
00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:33.933
was quoted saying that--

354
00:15:34.017 --> 00:15:36.311
- To maximize
radio listenership.

355
00:15:36.394 --> 00:15:39.356
women should be like
tomatoes in a larger

356
00:15:39.397 --> 00:15:41.191
salad of male artists--

357
00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:45.487
never played back to back
and never more than about 20%

358
00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:46.905
of the mix.

359
00:15:46.988 --> 00:15:48.865
- All of a sudden I
was this idiot saying.

360
00:15:48.907 --> 00:15:50.700
take women off radio.

361
00:15:50.742 --> 00:15:53.328
- The lettuce is Luke Bryan and
Blake Shelton and Keith Urban

362
00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:54.746
and artists like that.

363
00:15:54.788 --> 00:15:57.749
- We're not thinking
about gender fairness.

364
00:15:57.832 --> 00:16:01.878
We're just trying
to make money.

365
00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.255
There are certain things
that make ratings go down.

366
00:16:04.339 --> 00:16:07.092
Every country radio
station in a rated market.

367
00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:11.930
you won't find anybody
playing over 20% females.

368
00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:13.264
Not a single one.

369
00:16:13.348 --> 00:16:15.850
- The sad thing
about that comment

370
00:16:15.934 --> 00:16:18.269
was that it does
largely reflect

371
00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:21.564
reality as country radio
programmers understand it.

372
00:16:21.606 --> 00:16:24.401
- However dismal that
number is for white women.

373
00:16:24.442 --> 00:16:27.320
it's a fraction of a
fraction for Black women.

374
00:16:27.404 --> 00:16:30.615
I believe we make up 0.03%.

375
00:16:30.657 --> 00:16:32.867
Since its inception.
there have only

376
00:16:32.951 --> 00:16:40.290
been eight Black women to be on
the Billboard Country charts.

377
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:46.881
I am one of them.

378
00:16:46.965 --> 00:16:51.636
- There are 1.000 ways I can
respond to the question of. how

379
00:16:51.678 --> 00:16:54.597
do we make radio more diverse?

380
00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:57.892
But fundamentally.
we don't want to.

381
00:16:57.976 --> 00:17:00.937
- I don't think that there's
any financial incentive

382
00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:02.814
for them right now
to try to figure out

383
00:17:02.897 --> 00:17:07.318
how to market a Black woman.
because up until Beyoncé.

384
00:17:07.402 --> 00:17:09.487
there was no reason.

385
00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:12.949
- In a country where we
think there's racism--

386
00:17:12.991 --> 00:17:19.914
and there is-- there is no
racism by country radio.

387
00:17:19.998 --> 00:17:23.001
If you give me a
great record. I don't

388
00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:24.544
care what your skin color is.

389
00:17:24.627 --> 00:17:26.755
If the Beyoncé record
is the best record.

390
00:17:26.838 --> 00:17:34.012
I'll play it more
than anyone else.

391
00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:37.682
- Country music is supposedly
three chords and the truth.

392
00:17:37.724 --> 00:17:40.685
But one of the open
questions about country music

393
00:17:40.727 --> 00:17:43.355
is. who's delivering
that truth?

394
00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:50.111
- Who gets to say what country
is. what the South is about?

395
00:17:50.195 --> 00:17:52.030
- Beyoncé told you
years and years ago

396
00:17:52.113 --> 00:17:53.656
that she will never
take the country out

397
00:17:53.698 --> 00:17:56.701
of her because that's
who she is culturally.

398
00:17:56.785 --> 00:17:59.287
She grew up going to
the Houston Rodeo.

399
00:17:59.329 --> 00:18:01.164
When she came back to the
rodeo a couple of years later

400
00:18:01.206 --> 00:18:03.500
as a solo artist. she
wrote into the stadium

401
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:05.210
on the back of a horse.

402
00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:08.380
- When you look at the
cover art of Cowboy Carter.

403
00:18:08.463 --> 00:18:12.050
she's representing
that rodeo queen.

404
00:18:12.092 --> 00:18:13.551
- She's from the South.

405
00:18:13.635 --> 00:18:16.137
My parents are from
Louisiana. Alabama.

406
00:18:16.221 --> 00:18:18.682
Do I not to get to
have a say in what

407
00:18:18.723 --> 00:18:21.559
the South should sound like?

408
00:18:21.643 --> 00:18:26.523
- I'm stoked that Beyoncé is
tapping into her Texas roots.

409
00:18:26.564 --> 00:18:32.070
(SINGING) Time is ticking
like it always does

410
00:18:32.112 --> 00:18:34.030
It flies right by

411
00:18:34.072 --> 00:18:35.907
There's so much music
culture in Texas.

412
00:18:35.949 --> 00:18:39.077
and I think country is
an important dimension

413
00:18:39.119 --> 00:18:41.037
of that music.

414
00:18:41.079 --> 00:18:44.374
(SINGING) You can do to quell

415
00:18:44.416 --> 00:18:46.459
I grew up on the
outskirts of Houston.

416
00:18:46.543 --> 00:18:49.921
and I grew up obsessed
with country music.

417
00:18:49.963 --> 00:18:53.633
As a young Black girl.
listening to country music.

418
00:18:53.717 --> 00:18:55.593
it didn't feel strange to me.

419
00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:57.095
That was all I listened to.

420
00:18:57.137 --> 00:19:00.265
And that really formed
the foundation for what

421
00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:01.891
I think of as a great song.

422
00:19:01.933 --> 00:19:06.104
And I always carried
that with me.

423
00:19:06.146 --> 00:19:09.774
The first time I lived in
Nashville was in the early

424
00:19:09.858 --> 00:19:11.943
2000s. which was a
starkly different

425
00:19:11.985 --> 00:19:17.240
experience as a Black queer
artist than I'm having now.

426
00:19:17.282 --> 00:19:19.743
I'm not sure that
the music culture

427
00:19:19.784 --> 00:19:22.287
had been pressed
enough to diversify

428
00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:25.457
that I could find my place.

429
00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:27.459
(SINGING) Say my name

430
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:34.132
I started to experiment with
electronic music and R&B.

431
00:19:34.174 --> 00:19:36.760
In the quarantine
of 2020. I found

432
00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:41.014
myself just reaching for
something that felt like home.

433
00:19:41.097 --> 00:19:44.225
(SINGING) I've wandered
off from here to Houston.

434
00:19:44.267 --> 00:19:50.065
Looking for a place
that I can call my own

435
00:19:50.148 --> 00:19:53.109
In Nashville. we are
seeing some evolution.

436
00:19:53.151 --> 00:19:57.405
but there are ceilings that I
can't even feel that I don't--

437
00:19:57.447 --> 00:20:04.329
I'm not even aware of because
I can only get so far.

438
00:20:04.371 --> 00:20:06.748
- People are placed into the
box of. you're a Black woman.

439
00:20:06.831 --> 00:20:07.832
You can only do this.

440
00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:09.584
You should only be doing this.

441
00:20:09.668 --> 00:20:11.169
These are the boundaries that
we've established for you.

442
00:20:11.252 --> 00:20:14.339
Roam free. but roam free
within those boundaries.

443
00:20:14.422 --> 00:20:16.508
People have tried
to put whatever

444
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:19.678
labels or whatever boundaries
or limitations on Beyoncé.

445
00:20:19.761 --> 00:20:24.516
She's been able to stop and
say. no. this is who I am.

446
00:20:24.599 --> 00:20:30.438
- The first song on the
album. "American Requiem."

447
00:20:30.522 --> 00:20:33.274
See. this is the critical line.

448
00:20:33.358 --> 00:20:35.860
- (SINGING) Used to
say. I spoke too country

449
00:20:35.902 --> 00:20:38.154
And then rejection came.
said I wasn't country enough

450
00:20:38.196 --> 00:20:40.448
- They used to say
I was too country.

451
00:20:40.532 --> 00:20:43.243
Then I wasn't country enough.

452
00:20:43.326 --> 00:20:46.413
Whatever you think
of Cowboy Carter.

453
00:20:46.496 --> 00:20:48.873
this is a revenge album.

454
00:20:48.915 --> 00:20:51.501
I'm going to come back
with the baddest country

455
00:20:51.543 --> 00:20:53.837
album you've ever
seen. and I will

456
00:20:53.878 --> 00:20:56.923
show you up at your own game.

457
00:20:57.007 --> 00:21:00.051
- Before Act Two.
Beyoncé came out

458
00:21:00.135 --> 00:21:02.220
with a statement
on social media

459
00:21:02.303 --> 00:21:06.725
and shared that this album
was born out of an experience

460
00:21:06.766 --> 00:21:10.311
that I had years ago where
I did not feel welcomed.

461
00:21:10.395 --> 00:21:12.897
- You can only assume
she's referring to the 2016

462
00:21:12.981 --> 00:21:14.983
CMA Awards when she
performed "Daddy Lessons"

463
00:21:15.066 --> 00:21:16.693
with the Chicks.

464
00:21:16.735 --> 00:21:19.404
- (SINGING) With his head held
high. he told me not to cry

465
00:21:19.487 --> 00:21:21.740
Oh. my daddy said shoot

466
00:21:21.823 --> 00:21:23.199
Oh. my daddy said shoot

467
00:21:23.241 --> 00:21:25.076
- It definitely made me
think of that moment.

468
00:21:25.118 --> 00:21:29.247
while I was at the CMAs myself.
to see Beyoncé in my hometown

469
00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:32.334
of Nashville with the
Chicks. this is probably

470
00:21:32.417 --> 00:21:34.711
the best moment of my life.

471
00:21:34.753 --> 00:21:39.424
Then. an audience member in
front of me proceeds to say.

472
00:21:39.466 --> 00:21:42.719
get that Black bitch
off the stage right now.

473
00:21:42.761 --> 00:21:45.889
I remember instantly kind of
being taken back to reality

474
00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:48.641
in that moment to
realize that there's

475
00:21:48.725 --> 00:21:50.560
like a threat of
Black people being

476
00:21:50.602 --> 00:21:53.772
in this genre for some reason.

477
00:21:53.813 --> 00:21:57.734
For Beyoncé to not be welcomed
feels like a gut punch.

478
00:21:57.776 --> 00:21:59.861
- The crowd in the arena seemed
to enjoy the performance.

479
00:21:59.944 --> 00:22:02.947
but the social media
universe was another story.

480
00:22:03.031 --> 00:22:05.617
- Some country music fans
were not happy about

481
00:22:05.658 --> 00:22:07.285
Beyoncé's presence.

482
00:22:07.327 --> 00:22:10.955
- After the awards. the CMAs
published her performance

483
00:22:10.997 --> 00:22:14.376
on social media
that some people

484
00:22:14.459 --> 00:22:17.796
were using to
denounce Beyoncé being

485
00:22:17.879 --> 00:22:20.215
there or for outright racism.

486
00:22:20.298 --> 00:22:21.633
- That's right. folks.

487
00:22:21.675 --> 00:22:23.385
Beyoncé performed at
the CMAs last night

488
00:22:23.468 --> 00:22:25.095
and is on a mission to take
country music away from us

489
00:22:25.136 --> 00:22:26.763
hardworking white people.

490
00:22:26.805 --> 00:22:29.391
- Beyoncé did not belong there.
even looked out of place.

491
00:22:29.474 --> 00:22:31.309
Keep country. country.

492
00:22:31.351 --> 00:22:33.853
- I don't know why
they feel country is

493
00:22:33.937 --> 00:22:36.481
so precious that it
cannot be entered

494
00:22:36.523 --> 00:22:38.274
by Beyoncé from Houston.

495
00:22:38.316 --> 00:22:40.652
But here we are.

496
00:22:40.694 --> 00:22:44.489
- It wasn't out of the norm
to have someone like

497
00:22:44.531 --> 00:22:45.949
Beyoncé there.

498
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:47.992
The CMA awards.
every single year.

499
00:22:48.034 --> 00:22:49.786
they book a pop
star because they

500
00:22:49.828 --> 00:22:53.623
want to get as many eyeballs on
the presentation as possible.

501
00:22:53.665 --> 00:22:55.166
- I was skep--

502
00:22:55.208 --> 00:22:57.627
I am on record of being
skeptical when she

503
00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:59.170
came out with "Daddy Lessons."

504
00:22:59.212 --> 00:23:01.798
What angered me about it
was that it overshadowed.

505
00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.842
you know. two other
performers of color

506
00:23:03.925 --> 00:23:10.890
who were kind of naturally
there. Charley Pride. and then

507
00:23:12.017 --> 00:23:16.104
myself as a guest
of Eric Church.

508
00:23:16.187 --> 00:23:17.522
having me sing on
his song that's

509
00:23:17.564 --> 00:23:19.649
all about like
turning hate into love

510
00:23:19.691 --> 00:23:21.860
and getting rid of
these words of anger.

511
00:23:21.943 --> 00:23:27.365
And that upset me that
that was overshadowed.

512
00:23:27.407 --> 00:23:28.783
- I'm not gonna lie.

513
00:23:28.867 --> 00:23:30.618
My feelings were hurt a
little bit because there

514
00:23:30.702 --> 00:23:35.665
is a Black woman standing on
a stage that I wanted to be on

515
00:23:35.707 --> 00:23:38.835
and had never been invited to
be a part of. even though I was

516
00:23:38.877 --> 00:23:40.962
very much a part
of the community

517
00:23:41.046 --> 00:23:46.843
and had worked very hard to
be a part of the community.

518
00:23:46.885 --> 00:23:49.220
- Just because of
the race of an artist

519
00:23:49.262 --> 00:23:52.724
doesn't necessarily mean that's
the reason they're not being

520
00:23:52.766 --> 00:23:54.309
embraced by country fans.

521
00:23:54.392 --> 00:23:58.021
There are dozens of
pop stars or stars

522
00:23:58.063 --> 00:24:00.774
from other genres
coming to country music

523
00:24:00.857 --> 00:24:02.484
and getting a cold shoulder.

524
00:24:02.567 --> 00:24:07.197
- There have been attempts
at crossover in country music

525
00:24:07.238 --> 00:24:11.076
by everyone from
Jewel to Jon Bon Jovi

526
00:24:11.159 --> 00:24:12.911
that have not really taken.

527
00:24:12.952 --> 00:24:18.375
- Beyoncé far and away
is not the only one.

528
00:24:18.416 --> 00:24:21.878
- Lil Nas X is a
Black Southern man

529
00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:25.757
who stumbled across
a beat that sounded

530
00:24:25.799 --> 00:24:27.842
to him like country music.

531
00:24:27.926 --> 00:24:32.097
And instantly. Lil Nas X said.
I can do something with this.

532
00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:35.767
- (SINGING) Cowboy hat from
Gucci. Wrangler on my booty

533
00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:39.062
- He recorded a song that
he called "Old Town Road."

534
00:24:39.104 --> 00:24:42.190
He talked about having
Wrangler on his booty.

535
00:24:42.232 --> 00:24:43.942
Can't nobody tell me nothing.

536
00:24:43.983 --> 00:24:48.363
And he just thought a cowboy
song with this banjo sample

537
00:24:48.446 --> 00:24:51.199
would be an instant success.

538
00:24:51.282 --> 00:24:55.620
And he was right.

539
00:24:55.662 --> 00:24:59.499
- I want to say thank you
to every single person who

540
00:24:59.582 --> 00:25:02.961
has made this moment
possible for me.

541
00:25:03.003 --> 00:25:06.423
- It was only when Billboard
was told by factions within

542
00:25:06.464 --> 00:25:09.634
Nashville. we don't consider
this a country record.

543
00:25:09.676 --> 00:25:13.638
that Billboard decided
to pull "Old Town Road"

544
00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.974
off of the Hot
Country Songs chart.

545
00:25:16.016 --> 00:25:19.102
and then all hell broke loose.

546
00:25:19.144 --> 00:25:22.063
- A hit song is sparking
controversy over what country

547
00:25:22.105 --> 00:25:23.773
music should sound like.

548
00:25:23.815 --> 00:25:26.609
- Billboard pulled it. decided
it wasn't country enough.

549
00:25:26.651 --> 00:25:28.987
- "Old Town Road." a song
that Billboard actually

550
00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:31.656
removed from the country
charts because it

551
00:25:31.698 --> 00:25:33.783
wasn't country enough.

552
00:25:33.825 --> 00:25:35.410
- Is it because
this is somebody

553
00:25:35.493 --> 00:25:38.496
who's new to Nashville.
didn't record in Nashville?

554
00:25:38.538 --> 00:25:40.248
Is it because he's Black?

555
00:25:40.331 --> 00:25:42.125
Does his race matter?

556
00:25:42.167 --> 00:25:45.128
These were the kinds of
questions folks were asking.

557
00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:46.921
- Billboard responded
to the backlash

558
00:25:47.005 --> 00:25:49.758
by saying their decision to
take the song off the country

559
00:25:49.841 --> 00:25:54.012
chart had absolutely nothing to
do with the race of the artist.

560
00:25:54.054 --> 00:25:57.140
- That was Billboard.
as an institution.

561
00:25:57.182 --> 00:26:01.603
unilaterally deciding that
is where that song resides.

562
00:26:01.686 --> 00:26:04.272
That was not country
music's decision.

563
00:26:04.356 --> 00:26:06.566
but unfortunately.
country music

564
00:26:06.649 --> 00:26:11.696
got lumped with all of that.

565
00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:16.368
I think it's also important
to note that Lil Nas X

566
00:26:16.409 --> 00:26:18.495
was invited to the CMA Awards.

567
00:26:18.536 --> 00:26:20.038
It's also important
to note that he

568
00:26:20.121 --> 00:26:23.041
won a CMA Award for
his collaboration

569
00:26:23.083 --> 00:26:25.543
with Billy Ray Cyrus.

570
00:26:25.627 --> 00:26:27.712
- Billy Ray Cyrus was
approached and asked.

571
00:26:27.754 --> 00:26:31.508
would you participate in a
remix of "Old Town Road"?

572
00:26:31.549 --> 00:26:34.344
And he said. yeah.
because he wanted

573
00:26:34.386 --> 00:26:36.721
to help Lil Nas
X point a finger

574
00:26:36.763 --> 00:26:38.640
and pose a question
to Nashville.

575
00:26:38.723 --> 00:26:43.269
If I add a white country singer
and a cowboy hat to the song.

576
00:26:43.353 --> 00:26:46.773
does it instantly become
an actual country song?

577
00:26:46.856 --> 00:26:50.110
- "Old Town Road"
was all of me.

578
00:26:50.193 --> 00:26:54.072
It was everything that I'd
been raised on my whole life

579
00:26:54.114 --> 00:26:58.702
by banjo and bluegrass
and solid country hook.

580
00:26:58.743 --> 00:27:01.246
If country music fans dig
it. then it's country.

581
00:27:01.287 --> 00:27:03.665
- Even though Billboard
Magazine never let it back

582
00:27:03.707 --> 00:27:07.627
on its Hot Country Songs
chart. it established

583
00:27:07.711 --> 00:27:09.671
that "Old Town Road"
had kind of been

584
00:27:09.754 --> 00:27:11.798
a country song all along.

585
00:27:11.881 --> 00:27:13.550
- It did not stop there.

586
00:27:13.591 --> 00:27:16.344
It just blew him up to the
biggest possible proportion.

587
00:27:16.428 --> 00:27:18.888
So when we think about an album
like Cowboy Carter that gets

588
00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:21.266
people asking questions
to the institutions.

589
00:27:21.349 --> 00:27:26.438
so I think that is the major
thing that is going to assist

590
00:27:26.521 --> 00:27:28.189
artists of color
and queer artists

591
00:27:28.273 --> 00:27:35.447
and being able to move forward.

592
00:27:36.698 --> 00:27:38.575
- If I were to
point to a period

593
00:27:38.616 --> 00:27:40.952
where country music started
wrestling with its identity.

594
00:27:41.036 --> 00:27:44.956
I would say the killing
of George Floyd in 2020.

595
00:27:44.998 --> 00:27:46.958
- There are demonstrations
going on right

596
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.460
now all across the country.

597
00:27:48.501 --> 00:27:50.211
People on the streets in
the middle of a pandemic

598
00:27:50.295 --> 00:27:53.048
protesting the killing of
George Floyd in Minneapolis.

599
00:27:53.131 --> 00:27:57.302
- That prompted a reckoning
across the country that

600
00:27:57.344 --> 00:28:00.472
led to country
music asking. are we

601
00:28:00.513 --> 00:28:03.850
contributing to
this environment.

602
00:28:03.933 --> 00:28:10.231
and can we be more welcoming?

603
00:28:10.315 --> 00:28:13.109
- George Floyd and
Sandra Bland and Ahmaud

604
00:28:13.151 --> 00:28:19.407
Arbery got us as
a country to start

605
00:28:19.491 --> 00:28:20.992
thinking about these things.

606
00:28:21.034 --> 00:28:26.831
And country music finally
had to sit with itself.

607
00:28:26.915 --> 00:28:29.751
- And a lot of people put
out statements and posted

608
00:28:29.834 --> 00:28:31.795
black squares and
talked about the action

609
00:28:31.836 --> 00:28:33.963
that they were going to take.

610
00:28:34.005 --> 00:28:37.509
- It was very much. How can
we put a Band-Aid on this?

611
00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:40.428
instead of wanting to do the
inner work and inner healing

612
00:28:40.512 --> 00:28:43.765
that is required to create
meaningful change when

613
00:28:43.848 --> 00:28:46.518
something like that happens.

614
00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:49.729
- It took Mickey Guyton
10 years to get her debut

615
00:28:49.813 --> 00:28:51.272
album to be released.

616
00:28:51.356 --> 00:28:53.942
George Floyd had to
die for this woman

617
00:28:54.025 --> 00:28:58.988
to put out a song that got
recognized by the industry.

618
00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:02.117
- (SINGING) And if
you think we live

619
00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.452
- She's recorded records
like "Black Like Me--"

620
00:29:04.536 --> 00:29:09.207
- (SINGING) You should try
to be. oh. Black like me

621
00:29:09.249 --> 00:29:12.502
- --where the subtext of her
being a Black female country

622
00:29:12.544 --> 00:29:14.629
artist is now the text.

623
00:29:14.713 --> 00:29:18.508
And. you know. if country music
is three chords and the truth.

624
00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:23.179
that's Mickey Guyton's truth
and she's singing about it.

625
00:29:23.221 --> 00:29:25.557
- Country music is
always evolving.

626
00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.809
but when it does
that. there's this.

627
00:29:27.892 --> 00:29:32.230
like. push and pull
between what it used to be.

628
00:29:32.313 --> 00:29:39.487
where it wants to go. and where
other people are pushing it.

629
00:29:40.989 --> 00:29:44.659
- In 2021. TJ Osborne. one
of the two Brothers Osborne.

630
00:29:44.743 --> 00:29:46.870
came out as gay.

631
00:29:46.911 --> 00:29:50.165
This is remarkable in the
country music industry

632
00:29:50.248 --> 00:29:55.545
for a mainstream country act.

633
00:29:55.587 --> 00:29:57.756
- Before I came out.
it was like these--

634
00:29:57.797 --> 00:30:01.676
I felt very. like.
stiff anywhere I went.

635
00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:05.555
Well. you know. I was
micromanaging every move.

636
00:30:05.597 --> 00:30:07.307
(SINGING) Don't
give me that look.

637
00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:09.809
that "let me down easy" smile

638
00:30:09.893 --> 00:30:12.103
I would sit still
and hold a guitar

639
00:30:12.145 --> 00:30:13.730
and sing into a microphone.

640
00:30:13.772 --> 00:30:15.273
I didn't want to
do anything or say

641
00:30:15.315 --> 00:30:17.192
anything that might
bring questions that

642
00:30:17.275 --> 00:30:21.946
would make me uncomfortable.

643
00:30:21.988 --> 00:30:27.952
(SINGING) I'm right back
where I'm really home

644
00:30:27.994 --> 00:30:31.706
- When TJ came out to me.
I felt relieved for him

645
00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:35.418
that he was able to tell
me something like that.

646
00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:41.466
I knew that he wasn't
having to carry that weight.

647
00:30:41.549 --> 00:30:48.139
Secrets are heavy. and that one
must have been a metric ton.

648
00:30:48.223 --> 00:30:50.934
And I cried genuine.
happy tears.

649
00:30:50.975 --> 00:30:52.394
I was proud of him.

650
00:30:52.477 --> 00:30:54.354
I was happy to know that
he. like the rest of us.

651
00:30:54.437 --> 00:30:58.316
has been able to experience the
complexities of life and love.

652
00:30:58.358 --> 00:31:02.612
unfortunately. in secret.

653
00:31:02.654 --> 00:31:05.699
But I felt like that was
the first day of the rest

654
00:31:05.782 --> 00:31:10.286
of our lives as brothers.

655
00:31:10.328 --> 00:31:13.540
- I know that I wanted
to come out publicly.

656
00:31:13.623 --> 00:31:18.628
but how we were going to get
there was years in the making.

657
00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:24.426
In the video. "Stay a Little
Longer." we put a gay couple

658
00:31:24.509 --> 00:31:26.302
and an interracial couple.

659
00:31:26.344 --> 00:31:30.015
And there was a lot of people
that had a huge problem

660
00:31:30.098 --> 00:31:31.474
with all of those things.

661
00:31:31.516 --> 00:31:33.268
And it was like kind
of odd because it

662
00:31:33.351 --> 00:31:36.813
was like we were seen as
allies. which was amazing.

663
00:31:36.855 --> 00:31:38.857
But the whole time. it was
like kind of seemed phony

664
00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.817
to me because I'm gay.

665
00:31:40.859 --> 00:31:47.741
And so as it went on. it was
like. OK. we're gonna do this.

666
00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:50.118
It came out in Time Magazine.

667
00:31:50.201 --> 00:31:51.703
I didn't even get
to read the article.

668
00:31:51.745 --> 00:31:55.123
or I had no idea what
was about to happen.

669
00:31:55.206 --> 00:31:56.875
It was also
challenging because I

670
00:31:56.916 --> 00:32:00.503
didn't want it to be perceived
as attention seeking.

671
00:32:00.545 --> 00:32:01.921
I just wanted it
to kind of happen

672
00:32:02.005 --> 00:32:04.507
and move on with my life.

673
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:07.886
But things really changed
in an instant for me.

674
00:32:07.927 --> 00:32:11.097
- I hope you feel the tsunami
of love that is headed--

675
00:32:11.181 --> 00:32:13.767
that has been heading your
way ever since you spoke out.

676
00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:17.187
- And I did feel a sense of
purpose I'd never felt before.

677
00:32:17.228 --> 00:32:20.357
Being able to truly. completely
be myself and be happy.

678
00:32:20.398 --> 00:32:23.276
I had fallen back in love
with what we did again.

679
00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:24.652
more than I'd ever had before.

680
00:32:24.736 --> 00:32:26.237
I felt. like. a
closeness with our fans

681
00:32:26.321 --> 00:32:28.239
that I never felt before.

682
00:32:28.323 --> 00:32:29.532
I didn't know what to expect.

683
00:32:29.574 --> 00:32:31.159
I mean. I did not expect this.

684
00:32:31.242 --> 00:32:32.077
This is incredible.

685
00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.203
Thank you.

686
00:32:33.244 --> 00:32:34.746
- Yeah!

687
00:32:34.829 --> 00:32:36.748
- If I could go
back now from here

688
00:32:36.831 --> 00:32:39.709
and tell myself where I
would be. like. oh. my God.

689
00:32:39.751 --> 00:32:44.506
I would never believe that
I would have ended up here.

690
00:32:44.589 --> 00:32:48.927
Younger me came out of that.

691
00:32:48.968 --> 00:32:56.309
The very last line of the song.
"You got me where I am today.

692
00:32:58.228 --> 00:33:01.898
got a few things right
along the way. you'll see.

693
00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:05.735
Just wait. younger me."

694
00:33:05.777 --> 00:33:08.530
- I'm almost getting
teary eyed saying it now.

695
00:33:08.571 --> 00:33:10.699
It's all part of living.

696
00:33:10.782 --> 00:33:15.453
Life is scary. and it's kind
of messy and ugly sometimes.

697
00:33:15.495 --> 00:33:18.665
But if you push through. then
beautiful things will happen.

698
00:33:18.748 --> 00:33:21.835
And I think our lives
are proof of that.

699
00:33:21.918 --> 00:33:23.503
At the end of the
day. the people

700
00:33:23.586 --> 00:33:27.382
that will make the biggest
impact are the artists.

701
00:33:27.465 --> 00:33:29.300
- You know I love it
when you sing along.

702
00:33:29.342 --> 00:33:30.885
This is one of my favorite
songs of all time.

703
00:33:30.969 --> 00:33:32.637
It's called "Fast Car."

704
00:33:32.721 --> 00:33:36.057
- Luke Combs recorded that song
just to be an album cut. just

705
00:33:36.141 --> 00:33:38.560
almost as like a
fun thing. maybe

706
00:33:38.643 --> 00:33:40.311
a tribute to Tracy Chapman.

707
00:33:40.353 --> 00:33:42.313
It was a song that
he sung all the time

708
00:33:42.397 --> 00:33:43.898
when he was growing up.

709
00:33:43.982 --> 00:33:45.984
- (SINGING) You got a fast car

710
00:33:46.067 --> 00:33:48.278
I want a ticket to anywhere

711
00:33:48.319 --> 00:33:53.491
- So the reason that "Fast
Car" became this big hit was

712
00:33:53.533 --> 00:33:57.495
completely organically.
which is the new market that

713
00:33:57.579 --> 00:33:59.456
we're seeing opening
up in country

714
00:33:59.497 --> 00:34:03.209
music and changing the
paradigm that puts radio first.

715
00:34:03.293 --> 00:34:06.004
- So much of country music is
built on singing other people's

716
00:34:06.046 --> 00:34:09.674
songs. being able to appreciate
the people who create it

717
00:34:09.716 --> 00:34:11.217
and where it comes from.

718
00:34:11.301 --> 00:34:13.303
"Fast Car" is a song
created by a Black woman.

719
00:34:13.344 --> 00:34:15.764
- (SINGING) Maybe
we'll make something

720
00:34:15.847 --> 00:34:19.641
Me. myself. I got
nothing to prove

721
00:34:19.684 --> 00:34:22.645
- To see Tracy Chapman
on the Grammy Award stage

722
00:34:22.687 --> 00:34:25.065
with him in 2024 was
an incredible moment

723
00:34:25.148 --> 00:34:27.025
because it was him
stepping back and allowing

724
00:34:27.067 --> 00:34:28.777
her to have that moment.

725
00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:31.279
- The success of
Combs's rendition

726
00:34:31.362 --> 00:34:34.657
makes Chapman the first Black
female songwriter to top

727
00:34:34.699 --> 00:34:36.451
the Country Airplay chart.

728
00:34:36.534 --> 00:34:40.038
- We can't overlook that this
was the first solo Black woman

729
00:34:40.121 --> 00:34:41.664
to get these accolades.

730
00:34:41.706 --> 00:34:44.833
And so when I hear just sort
of the knee-jerk reaction

731
00:34:44.876 --> 00:34:48.170
of like. well. anyone who
doesn't like Beyoncé making

732
00:34:48.213 --> 00:34:51.716
country songs must be racist.
I think about all these

733
00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.467
moments here.

734
00:34:53.551 --> 00:34:57.555
- To see her being recognized
for the powerhouse songwriter

735
00:34:57.639 --> 00:35:00.934
that she is was incredible.

736
00:35:01.017 --> 00:35:04.437
I wish that it had
been for her version.

737
00:35:04.521 --> 00:35:08.274
Luke Combs took a lot
of flack. some deserved.

738
00:35:08.358 --> 00:35:09.859
some not deserved.

739
00:35:09.901 --> 00:35:12.362
But I really loved
the performance

740
00:35:12.404 --> 00:35:14.364
that he did on the Grammys.

741
00:35:14.406 --> 00:35:17.117
It had been the first time
that she'd performed in years.

742
00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:22.580
and it was the most poignant
moment of that whole evening.

743
00:35:22.622 --> 00:35:24.749
and rightfully so.

744
00:35:24.791 --> 00:35:28.920
And so I liked him centering
her in that moment.

745
00:35:28.962 --> 00:35:36.011
And I wish more
people would do that.

746
00:35:37.303 --> 00:35:39.264
This current moment that
we're having right now.

747
00:35:39.347 --> 00:35:44.602
you have this influx of
Black artists coming in.

748
00:35:44.644 --> 00:35:48.398
And it seems like
there's this Renaissance.

749
00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:52.360
You've got Madeleine
Edwards. Shaboozey.

750
00:35:52.444 --> 00:35:55.238
Camille Parker. Kane Brown.

751
00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.783
You've got Darius being a
modern-day Charley Pride.

752
00:35:58.825 --> 00:36:01.786
- We've built upon
so much of a legacy.

753
00:36:01.828 --> 00:36:04.080
You had Rissi
Palmer in the 2000s.

754
00:36:04.122 --> 00:36:07.876
And then we have Holly G
kind of coming in and taking

755
00:36:07.959 --> 00:36:11.004
the torch again and creating
Black Opry for all of us

756
00:36:11.087 --> 00:36:14.382
artists to come together
and to thrive collectively

757
00:36:14.466 --> 00:36:15.925
and individually.

758
00:36:15.967 --> 00:36:17.552
- When I'm at the
Black Opry. I'm

759
00:36:17.635 --> 00:36:19.220
thinking I'm the only
person around that's Black

760
00:36:19.304 --> 00:36:20.680
doing traditional country.

761
00:36:20.764 --> 00:36:24.934
- (SINGING) Spring take
me right on into summer

762
00:36:24.976 --> 00:36:28.938
- I met so many Black artists.
and it was like a homecoming.

763
00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:30.523
And then when we
started passing

764
00:36:30.607 --> 00:36:33.401
the guitar around
playing. I was like. wow!

765
00:36:33.485 --> 00:36:38.490
- (SINGING) It was six days and
seven nights in Myrtle Beach

766
00:36:38.573 --> 00:36:43.495
- (SINGING) And Tennessee blues

767
00:36:43.536 --> 00:36:46.122
- We wanna share our
stories. just like Luke Bryan

768
00:36:46.164 --> 00:36:50.335
and just like Morgan Wallen.

769
00:36:50.377 --> 00:36:51.503
- Woo!
Woo. woo!

770
00:36:51.586 --> 00:36:53.004
[applause]

771
00:36:53.088 --> 00:36:55.965
- And the thing that we
have working in our favor

772
00:36:56.007 --> 00:37:00.804
that our predecessors did not
is the internet and streaming.

773
00:37:00.845 --> 00:37:05.350
You still need country radio.
but the music is getting

774
00:37:05.392 --> 00:37:07.018
out directly to the fans.

775
00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:10.647
And for that. I think we all
can be extremely grateful.

776
00:37:10.689 --> 00:37:14.359
because I know for me. I
wouldn't have a career anymore

777
00:37:14.401 --> 00:37:17.153
if it weren't for that.

778
00:37:17.195 --> 00:37:20.281
- I know Beyoncé has an
incredible. glittering resume.

779
00:37:20.365 --> 00:37:27.372
but the deep relationship with
the fans is the true accolade.

780
00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:33.003
We revere her like
a queen. and we

781
00:37:33.044 --> 00:37:36.715
will follow her to
wherever she wants to go

782
00:37:36.756 --> 00:37:39.509
and whatever she wants to make.

783
00:37:39.551 --> 00:37:46.224
OK. "Jolene" is next. one of
the monsters of this album.

784
00:37:46.266 --> 00:37:52.480
I love that she takes
"Jolene" and makes it her own.

785
00:37:52.564 --> 00:37:54.232
- Dolly Parton.
she's been saying

786
00:37:54.315 --> 00:37:57.819
forever that she would love
to hear Beyoncé sing "Jolene."

787
00:37:57.902 --> 00:38:04.075
- (SINGING) Jolene.
Jolene. Jolene. Jolene

788
00:38:04.117 --> 00:38:08.246
- And. like. I think it
honors the original song--

789
00:38:08.288 --> 00:38:13.793
- (SINGING) Please don't
take him just because you can

790
00:38:13.877 --> 00:38:17.422
- --while putting
Beyoncéness into it.

791
00:38:17.464 --> 00:38:22.344
- (SINGING) I'm still a Creole
banjee bitch from Louisianne

792
00:38:22.427 --> 00:38:24.220
Don't try me

793
00:38:24.262 --> 00:38:25.347
- Oh. my god.

794
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:26.514
Like--

795
00:38:26.598 --> 00:38:28.016
- We love you.
- We love you.

796
00:38:28.099 --> 00:38:29.267
- We love you. Beyoncé.

797
00:38:29.309 --> 00:38:30.518
Thank you so much
for everything

798
00:38:30.602 --> 00:38:32.687
you did for music industry.

799
00:38:32.771 --> 00:38:36.149
- I think whenever Beyoncé
enters into a conversation.

800
00:38:36.232 --> 00:38:40.111
through no fault of her own.
I think it automatically takes

801
00:38:40.153 --> 00:38:41.863
all the air out of the room.

802
00:38:41.946 --> 00:38:45.450
Like you automatically are
going to look at the unicorn.

803
00:38:45.492 --> 00:38:47.535
Like. you know what I mean?

804
00:38:47.619 --> 00:38:52.624
And so. I've seen people say
some really hurtful things.

805
00:38:52.665 --> 00:38:55.919
like that she is
the reason Black

806
00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.420
people are in country music.

807
00:38:57.462 --> 00:39:00.298
And it's like
we've been working

808
00:39:00.382 --> 00:39:02.884
at this for a very long time.

809
00:39:02.967 --> 00:39:05.970
And I don't think
it's her intention.

810
00:39:06.012 --> 00:39:08.473
But yeah. I do think
that some of it

811
00:39:08.515 --> 00:39:11.309
does take the attention away.

812
00:39:11.351 --> 00:39:14.270
- I do have a fear
that this moment

813
00:39:14.312 --> 00:39:17.982
could take attention
away from women

814
00:39:18.024 --> 00:39:19.776
of color in country music.

815
00:39:19.818 --> 00:39:24.197
Now. that said. there has
been some data that that's

816
00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:25.573
actually not the case.

817
00:39:25.657 --> 00:39:27.367
- Beyoncé's new
album. Cowboy Carter.

818
00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:31.121
has boosted streams for Black
Country artists on Spotify.

819
00:39:31.162 --> 00:39:32.997
- I've often said in
a lot of interviews

820
00:39:33.039 --> 00:39:36.376
that it would take Beyoncé
putting the banjo on her song

821
00:39:36.459 --> 00:39:37.794
to. like. blow this up. right?

822
00:39:37.836 --> 00:39:40.338
Turns out that that
was kind of right

823
00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:44.509
because that has really blown
everything kind of wide open

824
00:39:44.592 --> 00:39:48.805
and given a spotlight from
more mainstream sources.

825
00:39:48.847 --> 00:39:53.852
But my question is. what
happens going forward. right?

826
00:39:53.893 --> 00:39:56.479
We can't just go.
oh. it's done.

827
00:39:56.521 --> 00:39:57.814
Yay!

828
00:39:57.856 --> 00:39:59.691
Because like. you know.
when the dust is settled

829
00:39:59.774 --> 00:40:03.153
and the next record comes
out. then what happens?

830
00:40:03.194 --> 00:40:05.363
- To all the record labels.
every radio station.

831
00:40:05.447 --> 00:40:10.285
every award show. my hope is
that we're more open to the joy

832
00:40:10.368 --> 00:40:12.537
and liberation that
comes from enjoying art

833
00:40:12.579 --> 00:40:14.622
with no preconceived notions.

834
00:40:14.706 --> 00:40:15.957
[cheering]

835
00:40:16.041 --> 00:40:19.753
- This is a gigantic
moment for Black people

836
00:40:19.836 --> 00:40:21.796
who live in the country space.

837
00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:24.382
Beyoncé is just
here. and she's out.

838
00:40:24.424 --> 00:40:25.925
But Tanner Adell lives here.

839
00:40:26.009 --> 00:40:29.262
Willie Jones. Rhiannon
Giddens live here.

840
00:40:29.346 --> 00:40:35.393
So she's absolutely changing
the lives of some of the people

841
00:40:35.435 --> 00:40:38.730
who already lived
in this world.

842
00:40:38.772 --> 00:40:43.401
[guitar playing]

843
00:40:43.485 --> 00:40:46.988
- When I look at my career
now. I'm more than blessed

844
00:40:47.072 --> 00:40:49.991
because I'm in my skin.

845
00:40:50.075 --> 00:40:51.743
It's going to get better.

846
00:40:51.785 --> 00:40:56.706
A whole lot better.

847
00:40:56.748 --> 00:41:01.044
It's gonna take love and
appreciation of all kinds

848
00:41:01.086 --> 00:41:02.504
and all colors of country.

849
00:41:02.545 --> 00:41:06.925
(SINGING) Yeah. and I've
been used to changing

850
00:41:06.966 --> 00:41:09.761
You can feel it in
the song I'm singing

851
00:41:09.803 --> 00:41:13.765
Between the laughter and tears

852
00:41:13.807 --> 00:41:19.646
All my life. I've
been shifting gears

853
00:41:19.729 --> 00:41:21.356
All my life--

854
00:41:21.439 --> 00:41:24.526
- I've just got invited to make
my debut at the Grand Ole Opry

855
00:41:24.609 --> 00:41:25.819
this summer.

856
00:41:25.902 --> 00:41:32.283
(SINGING) When I
close my eyes at night

857
00:41:32.325 --> 00:41:38.081
Then I awaken to light

858
00:41:38.123 --> 00:41:41.376
The money I made

859
00:41:41.459 --> 00:41:47.966
The Grand Ole Opry is a rite of
passage for a country artist.

860
00:41:48.008 --> 00:41:53.930
(SINGING) I want to live

861
00:41:53.972 --> 00:41:59.310
I want to live

862
00:41:59.394 --> 00:42:01.479
It is also an
opportunity to get

863
00:42:01.521 --> 00:42:05.275
in front of one of the largest
country audiences in the world.

864
00:42:05.316 --> 00:42:08.319
(SINGING) I'm gonna
drive in my car

865
00:42:08.403 --> 00:42:11.448
I'm gonna go to the store

866
00:42:11.489 --> 00:42:13.950
I'm gonna go for a run

867
00:42:13.992 --> 00:42:17.871
Then I'm gonna come
right back home
