- Well. I was thinking something more like around of 10.000.

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:07.045
Like. you know. I'm a upcoming artist.

588
00:24:07.078 --> 00:24:08.814
I'm trying to make it big like you.

589
00:24:08.847 --> 00:24:09.748
- Right.

590
00:24:09.781 --> 00:24:11.149
- It's not me. it's the labels.

591
00:24:11.183 --> 00:24:12.284
They come up with the pricing

592
00:24:12.317 --> 00:24:13.885
and I really can't do nothing about that right now.

593
00:24:13.919 --> 00:24:16.188
- Yeah. I can understand that and everything.

594
00:24:16.221 --> 00:24:17.756
But like we trying to fuck with you.

595
00:24:17.789 --> 00:24:20.125
Like we ain't trying to go to nobody else.

596
00:24:20.158 --> 00:24:22.227
Like I like your reputation and what you do.

597
00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.261
Know what I'm saying?

598
00:24:23.295 --> 00:24:24.429
- I respect that.

599
00:24:24.463 --> 00:24:27.966
The thing is I'm contracted. so the labels. everything.

600
00:24:27.999 --> 00:24:30.302
all the business pretty much runs through them.

601
00:24:30.335 --> 00:24:32.170
So it's nothing I could do at the moment.

602
00:24:32.204 --> 00:24:34.706
- You know how it is when you're trying to come up like.

603
00:24:34.739 --> 00:24:35.841
I need this right now.

604
00:24:36.575 --> 00:24:39.010
- Don't always think it's some money thing.

605
00:24:39.044 --> 00:24:40.745
Times is different.

606
00:24:40.779 --> 00:24:44.649

When I was coming up.

610
00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.262
So I know where y'all coming from.

611
00:24:57.295 --> 00:25:00.632
As long as you hungry and you keep going for it.

This is your idea.

Don't fuck it up. Testers.

679
00:27:27.345 --> 00:27:29.881
- What's up girl? - Hey babe.

680
00:27:30.782 --> 00:27:32.817
(indistinct).

681
00:27:32.851 --> 00:27:34.019
- Babe. I don't got it right now.

682
00:27:34.052 --> 00:27:35.153
I quit my job.

683
00:27:35.186 --> 00:27:36.388
- Quit your job?

684
00:27:36.421 --> 00:27:38.390
Like we don't got a fucking baby on the way?

685
00:27:38.423 --> 00:27:40.458
- Look Mario told me he has a better opportunity for me

686
00:27:40.492 --> 00:27:42.060
to get some money.

687
00:27:42.093 --> 00:27:43.461
Raise no ass claim.

688
00:27:43.495 --> 00:27:45.964
right now I'm working on getting some more.

689
00:27:45.997 --> 00:27:47.766
- So now you listen to Mario?

690
00:27:47.799 --> 00:27:49.300
You're following him?

691
00:27:49.334 --> 00:27:51.736
Twist. I don't want my baby growing up

692
00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:53.004
thinking shit like this is cool.

693
00:27:53.038 --> 00:27:54.172
He needs a role model.

694
00:27:54.205 --> 00:27:55.340
Get it together or I'm leaving.

695
00:27:55.373 --> 00:27:56.808
- What you mean you leaving?

696
00:27:56.841 --> 00:27:58.209
After everything we all been through.

697
00:27:58.243 --> 00:28:00.779
Now you trying to take my baby away from me?

698
00:28:00.812 --> 00:28:03.081
- I don't wanna leave. I just want better.

699
00:28:03.114 --> 00:28:05.116
And the route you and Mario is going.

700
00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:06.785
my baby don't need to be a part of.

701
00:28:06.818 --> 00:28:08.219
- Can I tell you something Diane?

702
00:28:08.253 --> 00:28:09.287
- Tell me anything.

703
00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.456
- Sometimes I don't know how to tell my brother no.

704
00:28:11.489 --> 00:28:13.491
He all I had since our parents died

705
00:28:13.525 --> 00:28:16.127
and we still got this crazy bond.

706
00:28:16.161 --> 00:28:18.129
- I understand that and I agree with you.

707
00:28:18.163 --> 00:28:19.798
Of course I want you to take your brother's side.

708
00:28:19.831 --> 00:28:21.499
but what's right is right and what's wrong is wrong.

709
00:28:21.533 --> 00:28:22.834

- Mario. what's up?

1284
00:52:01.985 --> 00:52:03.920
Let me ask you a question.

1285
00:52:03.954 --> 00:52:05.722
You always selling drugs?

1286
00:52:05.755 --> 00:52:06.723
- Nah.

1287
00:52:06.756 --> 00:52:09.259
- Look me in my eyes and you better no lie to me.

1288
00:52:09.292 --> 00:52:10.861
I never lied to you.

1289
00:52:10.894 --> 00:52:12.462
- Yeah. I'm out here working.

1290
00:52:12.496 --> 00:52:13.430

00:52:15.565 --> 00:52:17.968
You ain't taking care of me. What the fuck is $150?

1293
00:52:18.001 --> 00:52:20.237
- You gotta be grateful for what I give you.

1294
00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:22.639
Everything I do. I do it for a reason.

1295
00:52:22.672 --> 00:52:24.341
When your mother and your father die.

1296
00:52:24.374 --> 00:52:26.643
I promise them I'll always look after you.

1297
00:52:26.676 --> 00:52:28.278
I don't want you in these streets. man.

1298
00:52:28.311 --> 00:52:29.346
This streets is ugly.

1299
00:52:30.046 --> 00:52:32.949
Where do you get this fucking money from anyway?

1300
00:52:32.983 --> 00:52:33.850
- I had a number.

1301
00:52:34.684 --> 00:52:36.720
- And where you get that call from?

1302
00:52:36.753 --> 00:52:38.788
- That was a gift.

1303
00:52:38.822 --> 00:52:39.756
- A gift?

1304
00:52:39.789 --> 00:52:42.559
Where you get that work from. Sticks. right?

1305
00:52:42.592 --> 00:52:43.727
- Yeah. how you know?

1306
00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:44.594
- I know everything.

1307
00:52:44.628 --> 00:52:46.296
You know that little cute girl you met

1308
00:52:46.329 --> 00:52:47.430
the other day Victoria.

1309
00:52:49.299 --> 00:52:50.867
- That's why she was asking me lot of question. right?

1310
00:52:50.901 --> 00:52:52.569
- Where you think she came from?

1311
00:52:52.602 --> 00:52:53.603
- Figures.

1312
00:52:53.637 --> 00:52:55.939
- Me. I had her follow Sticks.

1313
00:52:55.972 --> 00:52:57.474
He led her to you.

1314
00:52:58.642 --> 00:53:00.710
Then when I get the name from her Mario.

1315
00:53:00.744 --> 00:53:02.679
I said. oh. shit. that was my nephews.

1316
00:53:03.747 --> 00:53:05.715
The fuck is you out here doing?

1317
00:53:06.516 --> 00:53:07.817
- Just trying to make a living to myself.

1318
00:53:07.851 --> 00:53:10.787
I ain't doing nothing crazy.

1319
00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:14.391
- Listen. you gotta get that money back to me.

1320
00:53:14.424 --> 00:53:16.793
You gotta work it off.

1321
00:53:16.826 --> 00:53:17.827
- I got you.

1322
00:53:17.861 --> 00:53:19.596
- Sticks won't help you.

1323
00:53:19.629 --> 00:53:20.997
- Nah. I don't want that nigga around me.

1324
00:53:21.031 --> 00:53:23.667
- It ain't what you want. It's what I'm telling you.

1325
00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:26.603
You taking this long. you don't know what you're doing.

1326
00:53:26.636 --> 00:53:27.971
That's what I'm trying to tell.

1327
00:53:28.004 --> 00:53:29.673
Leave the shit alone. man.

1328
00:53:29.706 --> 00:53:30.941
Quit while you ahead.

- Love you too. I got you.

1331
00:53:38.682 --> 00:53:41.751
(car engine roaring)

1332
00:53:45.789 --> 00:53:48.325
(indistinct)

1333
00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:01.538
- What's good. man?

1334
00:54:01.571 --> 00:54:02.706
- Sticks what up bro?

1335
00:54:02.739 --> 00:54:05.275
(indistinct)

1336
00:54:08.445 --> 00:54:11.881
- You know you been hitting my nephews with that work. man.

1337
00:54:11.915 --> 00:54:13.850
- Nephews. who the fuck you talking about?

1338
00:54:13.883 --> 00:54:17.554
- Mario and Twist. those my nephews. man.

1339
00:54:17.587 --> 00:54:20.090
- That's fucking crazy. son.

1340
00:54:20.123 --> 00:54:22.525
I ain't know that was your little nephews.

1341
00:54:22.559 --> 00:54:23.426
- Yeah. man.

1342
00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:24.928
I been trying to keep them niggas away

1343
00:54:24.961 --> 00:54:26.329
from the street ever since

1344
00:54:26.363 --> 00:54:27.430
their mother and father died

1345
00:54:27.464 --> 00:54:31.067
and you just let them nigga talk you into this shit.

1346
00:54:31.101 --> 00:54:33.770
- Son. they little niggas from the hood. son.

1347
00:54:34.437 --> 00:54:36.573
I ain't know them little niggas was your nephews.

1348
00:54:36.606 --> 00:54:37.641
like I said. son.

1349
00:54:37.674 --> 00:54:39.476
if you wouldn't have been so secretive with shit

1350
00:54:39.509 --> 00:54:41.044
I wouldn't have gave them at work.

1351
00:54:43.446 --> 00:54:47.017
- I don't even know what to do about this situation now. man

1352
00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:48.652
and I don't even know where they get money from

1353
00:54:48.685 --> 00:54:51.087
to even give you to start off this shit.

1354
00:54:51.121 --> 00:54:52.689
- Check your stash.

1355
00:54:52.722 --> 00:54:55.091
- Nah. everything counted for in the stash. man.

1356
00:54:55.125 --> 00:54:57.027
- They doing something. I mean.

1357
00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:58.561
obviously they really don't know what they doing

1358
00:54:58.595 --> 00:55:00.063
'cause they still owe that brick.

1359
00:55:00.096 --> 00:55:01.765
- That's what I'm trying to tell.

1360
00:55:01.798 --> 00:55:03.566
And now I gotta pay for that.

1361
00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:07.904
- I mean. that's your nephews and I gave it to them.

1362
00:55:07.937 --> 00:55:09.639
So it's gonna fall back on me.

1363
00:55:09.673 --> 00:55:11.141
But you don't want me to do nothing

1364
00:55:11.174 --> 00:55:14.077
because that's your nephews. so it's your work.

1365
00:55:14.110 --> 00:55:15.745
So you take that as a loss.

1366
00:55:15.779 --> 00:55:17.747
- Can't do nothing. man. what we gonna do?

1367
00:55:17.781 --> 00:55:19.849
Kill him. hurt him like we do everybody else?

1368
00:55:19.883 --> 00:55:22.452
- I don't know. - It's not even an option.

1369
00:55:24.054 --> 00:55:25.689
- Listen. I had a conversation

1370
00:55:25.722 --> 00:55:27.023
with the little nigga earlier. man.

1371
00:55:27.057 --> 00:55:30.427
I told them they got 24 hours to pass that bread.

1372
00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:32.696
So how you want me handle it?

1373
00:55:35.532 --> 00:55:37.434
- That shit is fucked up. bro.

1374
00:55:37.967 --> 00:55:39.869
- You getting too fucking emotional. son.

1375
00:55:39.903 --> 00:55:41.771
How are we gonna handle this?

1376
00:55:44.874 --> 00:55:45.909
- I'm still thinking.

1377
00:55:45.942 --> 00:55:46.843
- How we gonna handle this son?

1378
00:55:46.876 --> 00:55:48.511
- You gonna handle it.

1379
00:55:48.545 --> 00:55:49.346
Since you gave them the work.

1380
00:55:49.379 --> 00:55:50.780
now you gonna help them get it off.

1381
00:55:50.814 --> 00:55:52.749
- Son. I'm a fucking worker.

1382
00:55:53.616 --> 00:55:54.284
I ain't no working.

1383
00:55:54.317 --> 00:55:56.019
Nigga I'm gonna handle it my way

1384
00:55:56.052 --> 00:55:57.887
then they ain't gonna be a good way.

1385
00:55:59.889 --> 00:56:01.925
- Ain't nothing good about this shit. period.

1386
00:56:01.958 --> 00:56:04.027
- Well. how are we going to handle this situation?

1387
00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:07.497
That's your nephews. They owe lot bread.

1388
00:56:07.530 --> 00:56:09.833
They ain't pay us. so what are we gonna do next?

1389
00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:13.436
- So let me figure it out. I'm gonna call you phone.

1390
00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:14.804
- All right. bye.

1391
00:56:15.772 --> 00:56:18.942
(birds chirping)

1392
00:56:18.975 --> 00:56:19.809
- What up?

1393
00:56:19.843 --> 00:56:20.977
- What's good?

1394
00:56:21.745 --> 00:56:23.747
- Why you tell your uncle I gave y'all little niggas

1395
00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:24.914
that work?

1396
00:56:24.948 --> 00:56:26.716
- I ain't even know you knew my uncle.

1397
00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:28.752
I tried to lie to him. but he wasn't feeding into that shit.

1398
00:56:28.785 --> 00:56:31.588
- So you had no choice and you just went to him

1399
00:56:31.621 --> 00:56:34.491
and told him. "Oh. Sticks gave me some work?"

1400
00:56:34.524 --> 00:56:36.526
- Nah. he sent some bitch at me. bro.

1401
00:56:36.559 --> 00:56:39.462
- Bitch? So now you telling bitches your business.

1402
00:56:39.496 --> 00:56:41.831
- She was asking mad questions and I was just answering.

1403
00:56:41.865 --> 00:56:43.800
Sorry bro. I fell into it.

1404
00:56:43.833 --> 00:56:45.602
(indistinct)

1405
00:56:45.635 --> 00:56:46.469
