3
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.640
I was a girl like many others.

4
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.520
I had many dreams.

5
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.280
But I never thought that my life

6
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.600
would give me so much.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.760
FEBRUARY 2021
THE NIGHT OF THE GOLDEN GLOBES

8
00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.960
-Here we are.
-Damn. Dad. come here.

9
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.080
Come on.

10
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.720
We won!

11
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.720
We won!

12
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.120
Daddy!

13
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.880
Oh. my God…

14
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.120
I can't believe it.

15
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.840
Congratulations.

16
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.320
Go. Laura!

17
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.280
Holy cow! Giuseppe!

18
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.160
Yay! Come here!

19
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.760
Mom!

20
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.320
Well done.

21
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.560
Help. Marlon's here!

22
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.720
My heart was breaking. in bed.

23
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.040
Paola?

24
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.440
Mommy won.

25
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.240
Did you win?

26
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.080
Yes. sweetheart. I won.

27
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.360
Are you happy?

28
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.520
It's Harry Potter's magic.

29
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.600
Sweetheart. give me a kiss.

30
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.680
Look how happy they are.

31
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.760
Paola. are you happy. darling?

32
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.160
Laura. there's a surprise for you.

33
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.320
What is it?

34
00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.680
FALL 1992
SOLAROLO - EMILIA ROMAGNA. ITALY

35
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.440
And now I know what they're are saying

36
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.000
It's a terrible beauty we've made

37
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.760
So we make our love on wasteland

38
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.720
And through the barricades

39
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.640
Laura! It's late. go to bed!

40
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.840
This was my life when I was 17.

41
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.920
A life similar to those
of many girls from Solarolo.

42
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.920
Except that besides studying art.

43
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.080
doing homework.
going to church. and babysitting.

44
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.640
I used to play in piano bars
with my dad Fabrizio.

45
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.240
I really liked playing in piano bars

46
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.840
and I didn't want to give up anything.

47
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.920
That's why some mornings I had to rush

48
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.040
to get the 7:30 am train
that would take me to school. in Faenza.

49
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.560
And. like all teenagers.
I was madly in love.

50
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.440
Have you seen Marco?

51
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.800
I was happy that way.

52
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.800
But then. one day…

53
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.320
Laura Pausini. there's a call for you.

54
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.840
Hello?

55
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.760
Laura. you got accepted into Sanremo!
Do you get it? You're going to Sanremo!

56
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.400
Marco has left and will never come back

57
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.920
The 7:30 am train without him

58
00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.440
Is a soulless. metal heart

59
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.240
In the grey. cold mornings in the city

60
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.160
The winner is Laura Pausini.
with 7.464 points!

61
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.800
The youngest contestant!

62
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.440
Laura Pausini!

63
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.520
She's the youngest contestant. she's 18.

64
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.080
How old are you?

65
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:43.680
Look. it's a win that the whole orchestra
agrees with. right?

66
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.120
Laura Pausini. Give it up for her!

67
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.280
That night. at 18.

68
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.720
I won the most important
music festival in Italy.

69
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.960
I remember that. right after.
I asked my parents.

70
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.960
"What does a person
who becomes famous do?"

71
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.840
I sing

72
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.720
I sing

73
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:28.520
For whoever wants to listen

74
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.120
-Bravo!
-Laura.

75
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.080
From Romagna.

76
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.760
Give me a big kiss!

77
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:35.720
Hi!

78
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.240
She's here for you today.

79
00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:50.960
Lip balm.

80
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.680
Laura! Laura! Laura!

81
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.440
I sing

82
00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.960
Hello!

83
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.840
Hands in my pocket and I sing

84
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.120
My voice rejoicing and I sing

85
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.120
The band inside my head and I sing

86
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.120
Laura Pausini!

87
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.560
I'm running in the wind and I sing

88
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.360
My whole life and I sing

89
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.440
It's spring and I sing

90
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.640
The last night and I sing

91
00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.960
For whoever wants to listen

92
00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.400
I want to sing

93
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:48.760
Always. always singing

94
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.160
Singing

95
00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.640
I sing

96
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:09.200
SEPTEMBER 2020

97
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.680
Okay. now let's try with "pizzette."

98
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.840
-Can you divide it into syllables? How?
-Yes.

99
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.800
"Piz-zet-te."

100
00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:28.840
Well done.

101
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:29.760
ROME
LAURA'S HOUSE

102
00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.240
There's only two left. then we will read.

103
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.160
So. "cedrata." Do you know what it is?

104
00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.280
-Yes.
-Good.

105
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.920
-Have you ever drank it?
-No.

106
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.920
-Not even in school?
-No.

107
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.680
I'll let you taste it.

108
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.120
Smiles - Joy

109
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.840
Grandparents - Complicity

110
00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.000
Loving

111
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.400
Paola - Life - Love

112
00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.080
Happiness

113
00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.080
Almost 30-year long career.

114
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.640
Of incredible experiences.

115
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.960
To this day. I wake up and wonder.

116
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.440
"Why me?"

117
00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.960
This past year the world has stopped.

118
00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.600
Music has stopped. too.

119
00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.400
And for the first time.

120
00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.760
I've had the time

121
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.840
to live a normal life.

122
00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.120
And I really enjoyed it.

123
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.440
There's a question
that's been bugging me forever.

124
00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:58.720
and has become
even more persistent lately.

125
00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.240
What would have I done

126
00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.560
if I hadn't won Sanremo?

127
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.080
What would my job have been?

128
00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.600
Would I have had a family?

129
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.640
Would I have been happy anyway?

130
00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.080
Would I have sung anyway?

131
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.520
In short.

132
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.040
who would I have been?

133
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.200
You keep sending your messages.

134
00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.320
while we listen
to another song from the past.

135
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.000
Let's see who remembers it.

136
00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:35.920
No way!

137
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.680
Marcello?

138
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.440
Put that phone away. please.

139
00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.920
Listen here.

140
00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.720
Remember I told you I went to Sanremo?
To compete with young singers.

141
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.840
Yes. but you didn't win. right?

142
00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.040
No. I didn't.

143
00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:58.040
but it was
an unforgettable experience. Marcello.

144
00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.680
Yeah. right.

145
00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.600
Listen. Marcello.

146
00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.400
You really are something.

147
00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.120
Let's change radio station.

148
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.120
-I like this one.
-Great.

149
00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.400
Okay. we're here.

150
00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.000
Bye. Mom.

151
00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.000
Bye. sweetie. Be good. okay?

152
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:22.960
Yes.

153
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.920
Every time I try to imagine
a different life.

154
00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.960
that's how I think it would have been.

155
00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.000
I would've stayed in Romagna
and I would've kept studying.

156
00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.360
Architecture. probably.

157
00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.400
And I would have done anything
to open my own pottery shop

158
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.600
for which I took my high school diploma.

159
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:45.960
PAUSINI CERAMICS

160
00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.280
I think I would have had many chances

161
00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:05.400
to succeed in my work. anyway.

162
00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.680
I always had several plan B's.

163
00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.240
I liked to learn.

164
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.320
I wasn't afraid to test myself.

165
00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:16.400
And I've always been fascinated
by many professional fields.

166
00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.440
Not to have a safety net.

167
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.600
just for pleasure.

168
00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.000
because I never liked to depend on others.

169
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.840
I always thought that to be fulfilled.
I had to count on myself.

170
00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.640
Organized. but a dreamer.

171
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.040
Simple. but combative.

172
00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.520
Anyway. surrounded by art.

173
00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.840
in all its forms.

174
00:13:58.680 --> 00:13:59.680
LAURA'S HOUSE
ROME

175
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:07.600
Rosaria. I really like the song 711.

176
00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.200
I want to try it out.

177
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.920
Make the bass higher.

178
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:15.840
not the voice.

179
00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.720
I left you in a box

180
00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.960
To remember you

181
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.680
Go back to the beginning of the chorus.

182
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.520
I'd like to try the final part. but…

183
00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.160
I'm too low here.

184
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.040
I hear a cell phone

185
00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.560
-Ornella Vanoni?
-Yes.

186
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.320
I don't know the lyrics by heart yet. so…

187
00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.120
I feel like singing…

188
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:51.200
Without you I haven't been able since ever

189
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.920
Something like that. Try. Let's test.

190
00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.440
Test me. No. I want to say it here.

191
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.520
Test me a bit

192
00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.880
Test me

193
00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.600
Do you remember when we

194
00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.000
Would stare at the dark sky…

195
00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.320
Today I'm much more aware

196
00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.640
about what my life has become
and who I am.

197
00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:24.240
When I think back to when I started.
making my first steps into this world.

198
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.360
I feel fond of myself.

199
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.400
I get emotional. I was just a girl.

200
00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.520
Laura Pausini!

201
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:37.800
Thank you!

202
00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.960
Laura was shaking.
she couldn't wait to end the song.

203
00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:45.160
Last night. after singing. she relaxed.

204
00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.400
-Yes. I lost all my adrenaline.
-Right?

205
00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.520
I felt like a whole layer coming off

206
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.400
and I thought. "It's finally over!"

207
00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.200
It may seem strange.
but I didn't go to Sanremo

208
00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.560
to become famous.

209
00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.520
For me. it was already rock and roll

210
00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.320
to play in piano bars with my dad.

211
00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.160
I know what has happened this year.

212
00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.240
but it still feels weird to me

213
00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:08.640
that I have two records out
with my name on them.

214
00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:13.040
But everything happened so quickly.

215
00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:19.280
That night was incredible for everyone.

216
00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.360
for my family and my town.

217
00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.640
My grandmas were the most excited.

218
00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:24.800
How did it feel?

219
00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.600
It was a very big emotion.

220
00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.360
I heard you used to sing. too.

221
00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.680
In the church. as a girl. Like Laura.

222
00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:38.760
I won Sanremo and that night.
among the audience. there was the person

223
00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:42.480
who picked the song playlists
for radio stations in the Netherlands.

224
00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:47.400
Without even asking the record label.
he played La solitudine on the radio

225
00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.920
and. all of a sudden.
I was at the top of the charts there.

226
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.960
Here is the fantastic Laura Pausini!

227
00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.240
So I started working in France.

228
00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.680
Belgium. Switzerland. Germany.

229
00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.200
Finland. Sweden…

230
00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.960
I went everywhere in Europe.
singing in Italian.

231
00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:07.280
...and she's singing about loneliness.

232
00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:10.560
In Italian. "la solitudine."
Here's Laura Pausini.

233
00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:18.120
Tim Rice. the author
of Jesus Christ Superstar.

234
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.120
even wrote the English version
of La solitudine.

235
00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:28.320
It was crazy. and I remember

236
00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.960
the 18-year-old Laura saying. "I'm ready."

237
00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.640
This is Laura Pausini.

238
00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.480
Soy Laura Pausini.

239
00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.480
At some point.

240
00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.440
when I was 19 years old.

241
00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.080
they asked me to sing in Spanish.

242
00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:05.880
That's when I realized
something huge was happening.

243
00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:18.680
Laura Pausini. here she is!

244
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.640
Number one in Spain.

245
00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.760
the Netherlands and Belgium.

246
00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.680
You're doing very well
in other charts. too. so…

247
00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.920
this Europe Prize is well deserved
by Laura Pausini.

248
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.720
-Thank you.
-Laura Pausini.

249
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:34.440
-Here she is. Congratulations. Laura.
-Thanks.

250
00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.160
Since I succeeded in Europe.

251
00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:42.120
I had to go
to a different European city every day.

252
00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.760
But I couldn't easily leave Solarolo.

253
00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.440
so I moved to Milan.

254
00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:51.480
and I was alone for the first time.

255
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.240
So my parents looked for someone

256
00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.480
who could be like a nanny to me.

257
00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.400
That's how I met Mati.

258
00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.640
who's with me till today.

259
00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.640
Because. even though I was 18.

260
00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.560
I was afraid to be alone away from home.

261
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.360
On the first night I was terrified.

262
00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.360
But. like... tonight I'm happy.

263
00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:22.000
My mom scolded me

264
00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.640
because she doesn't want me to say "like."

265
00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.240
She says I have to speak properly.

266
00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.680
because I'm 20 now

267
00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.800
and people need to know that I can speak
Italian. I cannot use dialect.

268
00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.000
Suddenly. I had to realize

269
00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.760
that I was still Laura from Solarolo.

270
00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.600
but I belonged to anyone who wanted me.

271
00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.760
When your life changes so much at 18.

272
00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:56.280
everything is wonderful.
but also difficult.

273
00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.440
You don't have time for normal stuff.

274
00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.840
and sometimes you can feel lonely.

275
00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:07.040
I always had my family watching over me.

276
00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:09.320
and they still do.

277
00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.440
Because my family is my core.

278
00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.200
I use six eggs even though we're five.

279
00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:25.120
Why?

280
00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:26.880
LAURA PAUSINI'S HOME. ROME

281
00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:27.880
Because last time

282
00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.880
you ate so much that…

283
00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.440
We're hungry people.

284
00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.840
I think that love and happiness

285
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.320
sometimes come in ways you don't expect.

286
00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.800
-So. now tell me…
-This meal…

287
00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.280
and Jacopo if we did well.

288
00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:43.680
-Should we score you?
-Yes.

289
00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.160
-Well…
-Don't be shy.

290
00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.080
-Let's see.
-Have you tasted it yet?

291
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.120
I'd say A-.

292
00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.080
-Oh. my. thank you.
-Wow.

293
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.080
I thought I'd get married
in church with a white dress.

294
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.120
Instead. one day I met Paolo.

295
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.000
who already had kids.

296
00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.160
Who made it? The Romagnola?

297
00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.200
I made it with him.

298
00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.600
The eggs are slightly overcooked. but…

299
00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.280
Come on. that's not true.

300
00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.320
No. I'm kidding.

301
00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.960
We've reached a beautiful balance now.

302
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.720
There's Paola and her brothers.

303
00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:20.680
Jader. Jacopo. and Joseph.

304
00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.960
-Hey. handsome!
-Hi. Laura!

305
00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.280
Welcome among us.

306
00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.200
Oh. Mr. Paolo Carta is here.

307
00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.240
Paolo came into my life

308
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.440
the day he started to work
on the stage with me.

309
00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:56.920
By the way. it was my dad

310
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.040
who suggested I work with him.

311
00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.760
Initially. we didn't even speak
to each other.

312
00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:14.040
Because Paolo is very shy.
he's not like me. talking non-stop.

313
00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.120
-Interview with Paolo Carta.
-Hi.

314
00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.800
-Paolo Carta…
-Yes?

315
00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.040
No. forget it.

316
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.840
I don't know. suddenly I felt something

317
00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.200
I had never felt before.

318
00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.360
Come on. on the kick drum…

319
00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:41.600
Paolo and I have been together
for 17 years now.

320
00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:47.520
We've always been together. really.

321
00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.200
During these 17 years.

322
00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:52.480
I think I've only been away from him
for 20 days. total.

323
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.800
Our relationship is unique.

324
00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.160
There's love.

325
00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:19.800
But… it's something that goes beyond that.

326
00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:22.960
There's affection.

327
00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.400
I see family in his eyes.

328
00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.040
For me. he's my family.

329
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.880
Jader. how's your love life going?

330
00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.240
-It's not bad.
-It sucks.

331
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.560
-I'm kidding.
-I love it.

332
00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.240
But why "not bad"?

333
00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.600
No. it's going well.

334
00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:53.720
-Are you happy now?
-Yes.

335
00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.800
I've set my head straight.

336
00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:57.320
Why?

337
00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.560
Listen to her! What do you know?

338
00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.840
-And you. Jacopo?
-I'm not two. father.

339
00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.480
-"Father?"
-How old do you think I am?

340
00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.920
"Daughter." how old are you?

341
00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.800
-Eight.
-So you can do whatever you want.

342
00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:14.280
-Water. please. Mom. I'm full.
-Paola. you make me proud.

343
00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:19.840
First of all. speak right. I don't like
you using all these Roman words.

344
00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.560
You were born in Bologna.

345
00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:23.360
so speak your dialect. okay?

346
00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.680
"I was born in Bologna."

347
00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:26.280
Good. See? A bit of dialect.

348
00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.920
-Ballott'
-Good.

349
00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.000
Okay. now rinse them.

350
00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.840
Wash the toothbrush.

351
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.400
One thing I know for sure.

352
00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.080
"Now. the road was smooth…"

353
00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:42.640
Even if I hadn't won Sanremo
and I hadn't lived this life.

354
00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:46.600
I would have done anything
to become a mom anyway.

355
00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.520
Sure you don't want to come with me?

356
00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.120
Yes.

357
00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.240
Okay.

358
00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:56.760
Remember that Aunt Silvia is next door.
if you need anything.

359
00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:59.000
-Yes.
-Everything's fine with Physics?

360
00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.720
Do you need to review it?

361
00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.440
-No. Mom.
-Tell me a principle…

362
00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.640
Archimedes' principle.

363
00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.320
Archimedes…

364
00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.960
Well? Put the phone down.

365
00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.400
So. look at me.

366
00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:18.360
-A body immersed in a fluid…
-Sinks.

367
00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.040
No. Marcello!

368
00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:22.800
If it doesn't sink. it floats.
One or the other.

369
00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:27.040
It experiences an upward thrust.

370
00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:30.000
-Who thrusts it?
-The principle does!

371
00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:32.160
It's easy. So…

372
00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.240
Look. a cork.

373
00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.680
A fork.

374
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.600
I immerse them in water…

375
00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.560
-Why don't we google it?
-Marcello. get up.

376
00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.640
Come here.

377
00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:49.880
Now I'll take your phone
and immerse it in the water.

378
00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.920
so you'll get the principle right away.

379
00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.640
Come on!

380
00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.560
-Oh. gosh!
-Girls!

381
00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:01.200
-What?
-Paola! Girls.

382
00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.280
-That's enough. Come out.
-My turn.

383
00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:07.840
I've had the wish to become a mom

384
00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.720
for many years. It's like…

385
00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.600
I was born with it.

386
00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.480
Come on. you have to come out of the pool.

387
00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:16.880
-Please.
-No!

388
00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.400
-Well…
-No!

389
00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.960
When I met Paolo. I understood

390
00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.800
that it was with him that I wanted to make

391
00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.600
my wish come true.

392
00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.560
But it didn't happen.

393
00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:41.720
I couldn't get pregnant.

394
00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:48.200
Paolo would say.
"Don't worry. don't get upset."

395
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.560
But I was really hurting.

396
00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:57.240
I even thought it had to do with the luck

397
00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:00.480
I had had with my career.

398
00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.600
Having been so lucky there.

399
00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:08.680
I had bad luck becoming a mom.

400
00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:14.200
I wrote a song which is called Celeste

401
00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:18.360
to give myself one last chance.

402
00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.880
Something to believe I could make it.

403
00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.280
You'll have your father's eyes

404
00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.200
And his melancholy

405
00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.800
The year I was on tour with that song.

406
00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.400
I remember I was doing a concert
in Perugia

407
00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.960
and I couldn't breathe properly on stage.

408
00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:44.920
I would often approach Paolo and tell him.

409
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.960
"I can't sing. I'm out of breath."

410
00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:53.960
That's why I went to sleep
to my parents' house that night.

411
00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:57.520
When I woke up the next morning.

412
00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:03.560
I don't why.
but I decided to take the pregnancy test.

413
00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.760
They were in the dining room.

414
00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:11.080
I sat at the table. I looked at my sister

415
00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.520
and I told her.

416
00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:14.680
"Hi. auntie."

417
00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:19.760
And… we all started to cry.

418
00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:30.200
OCTOBER 2012
OFFICIAL FAN CLUB PARTY

419
00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.040
Thank you very much.

420
00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:38.320
A few months later.
I shared the news with my fans.

421
00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:41.760
who were already suspecting something.

422
00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:46.480
How difficult it was to keep the secret!

423
00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:56.000
From that moment on. a new Laura was born.

424
00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:59.200
I don't know how to explain it.
I felt like

425
00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:00.600
I was flying.

426
00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:12.320
Be a bit classier.

427
00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.440
Grandma is already complaining.

428
00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:18.840
I felt really slim
when I was actually really fat.

429
00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:21.120
I felt beautiful. but…

430
00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:25.000
I can't explain it. but I felt… whole.

431
00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.920
So. I'm here with the baby bottle.

432
00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:32.080
Listen. the song Celeste started.

433
00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:35.760
We're filming this video
because you're still in here.

434
00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:39.160
and maybe in the next one
you won't be in here anymore.

435
00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.440
You'll be out.

436
00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.840
We're almost there. Oh. God.

437
00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.520
FEBRUARY 8. 2013

438
00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:10.560
Congratulations. Give me your tiny hand.

439
00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:15.800
It's been a pleasure for me. too.
Thank you. bye.

440
00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:18.640
The duet of the year is ready!

441
00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.400
Go.

442
00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:33.240
Try to say. "And…" Again.

443
00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:36.360
I'm just like you

444
00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:41.080
-A kiss on the forehead and then on the...
-Lips

445
00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.320
-So? Well done. Congratulation.
-Good.

446
00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.000
You hit three notes wrong.

447
00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.200
-Who?
-You.

448
00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.560
Which ones?

449
00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:08.120
-You always…
-No. I did…

450
00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.520
Paola grew up with music.

451
00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:24.240
I think she would likely want

452
00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:27.360
to follow in our footsteps.

453
00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:34.160
I really fear the comparison with me.

454
00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:38.440
I wonder if it's right
to cultivate this passion of hers

455
00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.680
like my father did with me.

456
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.040
My dad always played a fundamental role.
as a father.

457
00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.520
but also in music.

458
00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:56.080
-Name.
-Fabrizio Pausini.

459
00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.000
-Just the first name.
-Fabrizio.

460
00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.000
-Last name.
-Pausini.

461
00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:03.120
-Age.
-Sixty years old.

462
00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.960
Okay. Occupation.

463
00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:07.880
I'm a musician. A great musician.

464
00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.680
Do you have any comment on the artist?

465
00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:14.080
I'm too partial. I would say…

466
00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.520
extraordinary.

467
00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.880
-Oh. Daddy…
-Number one.

468
00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.040
You're so sweet.

469
00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:27.880
I had sung in piano bars for ten years.

470
00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:31.200
In winter. we used to play in Bologna

471
00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.320
in a pizza restaurant.

472
00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:36.800
while in summer I used to sing every night
in the square of Cervia.

473
00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.640
I sang different songs every night.

474
00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.480
Ten years of piano bar gave me

475
00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:46.680
a strong sense of discipline.

476
00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:49.120
and I owe it to him.

477
00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:54.320
Of course. let's not forget about Gianna.

478
00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.760
What's your relationship
with Laura Pausini?

479
00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:00.720
Well. I carried her in my womb
for nine months.

480
00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:04.920
seven of which I was stuck in bed.
so I deserve to enjoy her success.

481
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.840
Oh. my! So you're her mom.

482
00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:10.280
Yes. I am. I don't know if you can tell.

483
00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.280
Thank you. goodbye.

484
00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.920
-Oh. the interview is over?
-Yes. it's short.

485
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.920
Okay. well. goodbye. then. Bye bye!

486
00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:25.120
She always wanted me
to become a pharmacist.

487
00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:28.120
That was her dream. So. when I told her

488
00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:31.520
that I wanted to play in piano bars
with my dad.

489
00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:35.560
on the one hand I could see him
with heart-shaped eyes.

490
00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:39.600
while on the other. she was like.
"No! I failed!

491
00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:43.720
"I've lost her to music. too."

492
00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:50.280
If you weren't a singer.
what would you have been?

493
00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:54.280
Either an architect or a ceramic painter.

494
00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:58.680
And I would have fought really hard
to play in piano bars.

495
00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.280
-All that stuff.
-All wasted.

496
00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.320
Shall we freeze it?

497
00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.680
-Here I am.
-Hey. where have you been?

498
00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:19.240
She's been playing for half an hour.
Everyone will leave.

499
00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:23.120
No. come on. She studies
at the Conservatory. that's why.

500
00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:26.400
-How many people are there?
-25 people. We're half full.

501
00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.120
-Good.
-There's Ale for you. Do you remember him?

502
00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:32.760
Of course I do! He's not here for me.
he's here for your lasagna.

503
00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.240
-Stop it!
-Yes.

504
00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:37.800
-Hi.
-Hi.

505
00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:41.520
Good evening. everyone.

506
00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.000
Enjoy your dinner.

507
00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:46.080
Let's let the music do the talking.

508
00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:49.200
Volume up. okay?

509
00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:52.680
They said to keep it down
to avoid disturbing them while eating.

510
00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.560
Always the same.

511
00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:08.560
In this carousel of souls

512
00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:15.560
Those who turn are lost
And stay here

513
00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:21.680
I know for sure. my friend

514
00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:24.160
I turned. too

515
00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:30.280
And I had to run to reach you

516
00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:37.680
And tell me why

517
00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:43.680
In this carousel of souls
There is not

518
00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:45.360
No

519
00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:50.840
A place to shake ourselves off

520
00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:56.800
What we were told and

521
00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:59.040
What we already know

522
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.720
SAN SIRO STADIUM. MILAN
JUNE 2. 2007

523
00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:11.960
I'll take the train to Paradise City

524
00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:17.240
I'll take a seat

525
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.200
SAN SIRO WITH YOU
DESTINATION PARADISE!!

526
00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:22.880
And you sat there at my side
Will tell me

527
00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:26.120
Destination: Paradise

528
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.200
Paradise City

529
00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:41.120
Music has given me
indescribable satisfaction.

530
00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:44.280
The night in San Siro is one of those.

531
00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.080
You know…

532
00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:51.800
This is the first time in San Siro for me.

533
00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:58.160
I'm proud to represent
my Italian female colleagues

534
00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:00.280
who will come up on this stage.

535
00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:02.240
because tonight I'm the first one.

536
00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.200
but I won't be the last one.

537
00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:14.440
Music took me around the world. too.

538
00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:16.600
New York.

539
00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:23.000
Thanks to music. I had the chance

540
00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:26.680
to meet

541
00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:30.280
incredible people and awesome artists

542
00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.760
who used to be my idols.

543
00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.840
and now I'm lucky enough
to call them friends.

544
00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.880
I got to know many cultures

545
00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.440
and languages.

546
00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.800
But above all. I got to know
the Latin American world.

547
00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:02.600
which is my second family.

548
00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:05.880
Look what she has here.

549
00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:09.560
Ah! Brazilian!

550
00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:11.960
It's a gift from Hebe.

551
00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:17.960
Hola!

552
00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:22.040
I think that in another life

553
00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:25.360
I must've been Spanish
or Brazilian. Mexican…

554
00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.560
Are you all right?

555
00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:32.160
We're having a concert in Panama.

556
00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:38.800
When I'm there. I feel at home.

557
00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:42.480
The people there make me feel at home.

558
00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:56.880
Thank you Uruguay. Paraguay.
Ecuador. Chile.

559
00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:01.960
and above all. the people
who were born and live in Buenos Aires.

560
00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:04.040
Good night!

561
00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:20.840
There was a time in my life
before meeting Paolo

562
00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:23.640
in which. despite my career going well.

563
00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.720
everything else was hard to cope with.

564
00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.560
Laura!

565
00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.480
You're always under the spotlight.

566
00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:35.440
you feel people are close to you
for your success and money.

567
00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:36.880
Laura?

568
00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:45.240
You never know if the love you get
is 100% genuine.

569
00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:52.320
I couldn't make any of my personal dreams
come true.

570
00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:55.840
Luckily. at that time.

571
00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:59.560
I had the strength to write
Resta in Ascolto.

572
00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:07.160
It was an important record for me.

573
00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:10.920
The first one I had produced by myself.
a real adventure.

574
00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.400
Thanks to that record.

575
00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:22.120
I won an award which is
really important for musicians.

576
00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:36.920
But then. after the ceremony.

577
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.080
I went to my hotel room

578
00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:41.200
and I was alone.

579
00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:44.880
With the Grammy in hand. but alone.

580
00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:51.680
At that time.
my family couldn't travel with me

581
00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.960
and I didn't have a boyfriend.

582
00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.760
I remember I had a burger
delivered to my room

583
00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:01.760
and the waiter also brought
a bottle of champagne

584
00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.000
to celebrate with him.

585
00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:10.640
I completely felt in a black hole.

586
00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:14.720
I had the golden Grammy with me.

587
00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.960
but everything else around me was dark.

588
00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:22.120
If I had no one to celebrate with.
I was clearly doing something wrong.

589
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.960
That's when I realized

590
00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:30.120
I wasn't giving the right value
to my priorities.

591
00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:35.800
My family. my friends.
the people I really cared about.

592
00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:40.000
You have six months of back rent.

593
00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:43.720
If you don't pay everything
by the end of the month.

594
00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:47.000
I'll kick you and all your friends out.

595
00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:49.160
Okay? Have a good day.

596
00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:51.840
But. as usual.

597
00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:56.360
when I realize I'm doing something wrong
or there's a problem.

598
00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:57.640
I don't stop.

599
00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:59.280
PAUSINI CERAMICS

600
00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:03.160
Listen. Laura. I don't have your strength.

601
00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:07.080
You opened up this shop
and raised Marcello on your own.

602
00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:11.320
If I have to close the restaurant.
I don't know what to do.

603
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.200
All the other girls. too.

604
00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.120
I have an idea.

605
00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:21.760
Let's organize a big dinner. an event.

606
00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:25.440
Some sort of new opening.
a new inauguration.

607
00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:26.400
Yes.

608
00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:28.920
We can ask Cristiano
to prepare a new menu.

609
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.400
We'll advertise it in Faenza
and the towns around.

610
00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:36.680
But we need a theme.

611
00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:39.080
Like. "The 90s."

612
00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:42.400
-Yes!
-Both for the food and the music.

613
00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:45.960
-A big night.
-Yes. a big event.

614
00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:47.120
2009. "FRIENDS FOR ABRUZZO"
FUNDRAISING FOR THE EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS

615
00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.480
Thank you!

616
00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:53.560
We're here for Abruzzo. We're all here.

617
00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:58.720
And tonight
we're making history in San Siro!

618
00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:11.760
When I was a kid. my dad taught me

619
00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:15.840
the huge power music can have

620
00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:19.760
to change people's minds.

621
00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:25.200
Mainly towards those who are most in need.

622
00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:31.480
Tonight we are calling for education.
health. and justice.

623
00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:33.560
CHIME FOR CHANGE
LONDON. JUNE 1. 2013

624
00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:37.280
For every girl. every woman. everywhere.

625
00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:39.800
Make some noise!

626
00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:44.120
I feel privileged to be able
to be on the front line.

627
00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:48.880
to do something important
for the causes I believe in.

628
00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:58.800
When Paola was four months old.

629
00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:01.120
I was invited by Beyoncé

630
00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:05.080
to participate in the charity concert
"Chime For Change" in London.

631
00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:09.000
I had thought to travel less.

632
00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:13.640
to do less promotion and less concerts.

633
00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:17.240
to reconsider the way I used to live.

634
00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:21.880
But in the end. we tried to go.

635
00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:35.240
When we were on the flight.
she sent us a message as if to say.

636
00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:37.800
"I'm ready. I want to travel with you."

637
00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:39.680
Mom. you take that.

638
00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:43.320
From then on. we never stopped.

639
00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:46.520
We'll meet you in Rome. bye.

640
00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:50.160
For the first six years of her life.

641
00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:52.560
we did everything and then some.

642
00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:57.000
-Where are we?
-We're in Miami. yay!

643
00:44:57.080 --> 00:45:00.320
When you see her travelling.
she seems born for this.

644
00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:03.040
she knows her way
around an airport. a hotel…

645
00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:10.200
We always saw her happy.
that's why we didn't even realize

646
00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:13.160
that my work.
instead of decreasing. intensified.

647
00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:15.320
Laura!

648
00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:18.040
Because. in addition to concerts
and records.

649
00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:20.720
now there was also the whole TV world.

650
00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:34.240
I did two editions of The Voice in Mexico

651
00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:35.880
and two in Spain.

652
00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:40.920
One X Factor in Spain…

653
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.240
Tonight I'm really bitchy.

654
00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:47.520
…two La Banda in Miami.

655
00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:49.800
Laura e Paola in Italy…

656
00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:52.200
If we post a nice picture on Twitter.

657
00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:55.440
maybe it even becomes a trending topic.

658
00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:59.520
Hey kiddo. be careful
or I'll pop your trending topic.

659
00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:00.600
Pop it?

660
00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:06.880
…Stasera Laura in Taormina

661
00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:10.560
and so many other things
I cannot believe I did.

662
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.120
Let me stroke your hair like 20 years ago.

663
00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:20.320
-You're even more beautiful now.
-Thank you. Pippo.

664
00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:25.760
-Wow. So cool.
-Do you like it?

665
00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:30.320
Paola is older now.
she started elementary school

666
00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:35.920
and I wish for her to have roots.

667
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.920
friends. a routine.

668
00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:42.720
Because touring the world.

669
00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.920
singing on the biggest stages.

670
00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:50.400
moving from one latitude to another
is beautiful

671
00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:53.240
and it may seem just beautiful.

672
00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:55.440
-Mom!
-Sorry. love.

673
00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:57.920
I have to turn off the phone now.

674
00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:00.400
But real life

675
00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:03.200
inevitably gets put aside.

676
00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:12.680
Tonight. it feels strange to sing.

677
00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:16.040
Tonight I'm losing my best friend.

678
00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:20.960
But I'm here.
And I'm here because this is my job.

679
00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:26.320
And I'm…

680
00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:30.120
I was very…

681
00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:34.720
I'm a bit confused. I don't know

682
00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:37.040
if I'm doing the right thing.

683
00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.760
But earlier. when I started to sing

684
00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:44.520
the third song.
Come se non fosse stato mai amore.

685
00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:47.400
I realized I was not wrong.

686
00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:48.800
I had to be here.

687
00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:52.320
I wanted to be here.
and he wanted me to be here.

688
00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:58.120
But I'm telling you…

689
00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:02.000
And please. understand me…

690
00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:08.080
Sometimes I can't be smiling
throughout the whole song

691
00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:11.200
because I think
I'd like to be there with him

692
00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:13.160
and hold his hand while he's dying.

693
00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:21.360
Giuseppe was my neighbor.

694
00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:25.120
Our houses were as close

695
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.840
as we came to be.

696
00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:31.760
We were like brother and sister.

697
00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:36.040
I met him and Francesco. his boyfriend.

698
00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:38.120
when I was living alone.

699
00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:43.360
We laughed and cried a lot together.

700
00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:49.120
That night.

701
00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:51.120
after the concert.

702
00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:55.720
while I was going back to Milan by car

703
00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:57.680
Giuseppe passed away.

704
00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:02.600
During the months after his death.

705
00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:05.760
I felt wrapped up in a very strange vibe.

706
00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:08.080
As if I had cotton on my face.

707
00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:15.760
I kept going. but I couldn't see anything.

708
00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:27.200
So. I decided to go back home.

709
00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:33.800
Once again. when I don't feel right.

710
00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:35.240
I have to go back home.

711
00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:38.960
-Here they are! Go. go. go!
-Come!

712
00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:40.520
-Who is it?
-Go meet them.

713
00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:44.400
-Marlon. who is it?
-Finally!

714
00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:46.560
-Hi!
-Hello!

715
00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:48.760
Hi. Marlon!

716
00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:51.280
I know my parents are there.

717
00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:53.600
my dog Marlon. my town.

718
00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:56.080
and one of the people I love the most.

719
00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:57.560
my sister Silvia.

720
00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:03.000
She's always with me. even when she can't.

721
00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:05.280
Sister of the year!

722
00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:12.960
We're different
and we have two different lives.

723
00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:14.560
Look at these costumes.

724
00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:17.920
But we've been very close
since we were kids.

725
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.680
When Paola saw it. she said.
"Auntie had curly hair."

726
00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:24.760
What's the news here in Solarolo?

727
00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:25.840
Hi.

728
00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:28.920
In Solarolo. there are my friends. too.

729
00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:34.000
-People get together. then break up.
-Well. tell me everything. Catch me up.

730
00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:36.000
Andrea is my friend from church.

731
00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:40.680
while Franco had to put up
with all my teenage tantrums.

732
00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:43.680
-It's been so long.
-Really long.

733
00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:46.960
-Do you remember where you used to sing?
-Over there.

734
00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:59.400
A night of sweat

735
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.560
On the boat in the sea

736
00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:05.760
And while the sky gets clear

737
00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:08.600
You look at your empty nets

738
00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:12.160
But the voice calling you

739
00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:15.840
Let's go to Elisa's to get some bread.

740
00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:18.000
Good morning. you're already here!

741
00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:19.160
-Hi. Paola!
-Yes.

742
00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:20.920
Then there are "the Synchronettes."

743
00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:22.920
my schoolmates.

744
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.240
-Hi.
-How are you?

745
00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:25.720
I did everything with them.

746
00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:29.720
Ready? One. two. three.

747
00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:34.640
The Synchronettes Party 2017!

748
00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:40.080
We're called "the Synchronettes"
because we're synchronized.

749
00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:42.160
or at least we think we are.

750
00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:45.680
Come on!

751
00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:52.280
Come on!

752
00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:57.000
One. two. three…

753
00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:58.960
Well?

754
00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:00.720
Go. Synchronettes!

755
00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.200
I often rely on them.

756
00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:05.640
Synchronettes!

757
00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:10.400
-How is it?
-Very good.

758
00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:12.840
I like that my friends from Solarolo

759
00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:16.480
look at me as they used to
when we were in school.

760
00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:18.800
-I don't…
-I know why you were there.

761
00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:20.440
You went to check Paino.

762
00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:23.520
I'm sure of that!

763
00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:25.760
They make fun of me as they used to.

764
00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:27.720
they love me as they used to.

765
00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:30.040
and if they don't agree

766
00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:33.440
with something.
they tell me as they used to.

767
00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:37.760
Anyway. you missed me and her in piano bar

768
00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:39.120
singing…

769
00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.800
While on TV

770
00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:45.120
Drink it because it's Tropicana. yeah

771
00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:47.120
With some shimmying. too.

772
00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:55.480
In Romagna. I have time to listen
and to be listened by others.

773
00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:58.880
Especially my parents.

774
00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:02.800
-So?
-What's new in your life?

775
00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:05.400
I don't know.

776
00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:08.920
It's been a strange period for me.

777
00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:14.600
And. I have to say. I'm a bit… confused.

778
00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:16.640
-Unsettled.
-Unsettled. yes.

779
00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:20.400
For the first time. I wondered.

780
00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:24.760
"What would've happened
if I hadn't won Sanremo?"

781
00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:30.040
Well. you had a lot of dreams
besides singing.

782
00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:34.480
Studying Architecture. doing pottery…

783
00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:38.480
You would've had a normal life. let's say.

784
00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:42.960
With all the problems
normal people have to overcome.

785
00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:45.240
-Maybe I've never…
-You've never lived it.

786
00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:46.280
-No.
-No.

787
00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:50.080
It's like I only know one kind of life.

788
00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:53.320
Which is not a normal one.

789
00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:57.560
Unfortunately… I mean. I say
"unfortunately" because in my opinion.

790
00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:00.720
that's the downside of your life.

791
00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:05.160
You've had many upsides. but now
the downside is difficult to cope with.

792
00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:08.440
I didn't even want you to sing.

793
00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:10.000
I know. That's why…

794
00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:11.840
I've never hindered you. but…

795
00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:16.640
With the years passing.
especially since Paola was born.

796
00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:19.000
I feel more and more

797
00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:23.120
like I'm made
of two different personalities.

798
00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:26.520
Yours. with your beliefs.
and his. with his beliefs.

799
00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:30.960
Maybe until now I've lived with enthusiasm

800
00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:35.160
because I'm like him.

801
00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:37.640
but I controlled it
because I'm also like you.

802
00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:42.400
And I'm grateful for that.
because I think I'm too normal

803
00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:48.000
and I can no longer keep up
with that other big world

804
00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:49.720
that drives you crazy.

805
00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:52.360
It's a responsibility.
so it's hard. I get it.

806
00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:57.480
Moreover. Paola has started to say.

807
00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:59.360
"I'm not as good as you are.

808
00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:01.840
"I'm not as talented as you are…"

809
00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:04.880
And that's always been

810
00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:08.240
a cause for concern for me.

811
00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:11.120
because I'm afraid that my presence

812
00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:14.600
is overshadowing her.
I'm doing too many things that…

813
00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:17.600
make her think…

814
00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:21.400
Famous people's children always feel
some responsibilities upon them.

815
00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:23.280
Right.

816
00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:26.600
-That's how it is.
-I don't know what to do. What can I…

817
00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:27.880
I didn't want to…

818
00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:29.800
If I have to devote myself

819
00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:32.840
to my career.
with everything it's given me so far.

820
00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:36.440
I don't have time to devote myself to her.

821
00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:37.960
It's not the only thing...

822
00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:40.200
But in the last two years.

823
00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:43.760
I could help her with homework.
I could pick her up at school…

824
00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:45.160
I've felt more…

825
00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:49.520
Happier about being…

826
00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:52.040
Fairer to her. at peace with myself

827
00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:54.400
for acting like a good mom.

828
00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:59.000
But it's not just time
that turns you into a good mother.

829
00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:00.040
It's not just that.

830
00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:03.280
Maybe I see problems
that don't exist. Okay.

831
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.360
But he didn't answer my main question.

832
00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:07.880
The first one I asked.

833
00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:11.400
If I hadn't won Sanremo.
what do you think I would've done?

834
00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:13.320
-Maybe piano bar…
-Cooking.

835
00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:15.840
-She was…
-No. Dad. that's not true.

836
00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:18.320
-You'd have been a culinary critic.
-Yes.

837
00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:20.240
And I would have sung at night.

838
00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:24.000
I don't think you would've kept going on

839
00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:26.240
for long with piano bars.

840
00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:27.600
-You don't?
-No.

841
00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:28.960
Why is that? Tell me.

842
00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:34.200
Because you would've lost the motivation.
being busy with another job.

843
00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:37.360
She would've quit any other job.

844
00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:42.000
-That's what she liked.
-See?

845
00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:44.560
-That's what she liked.
-That's my opinion.

846
00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:52.240
Here everything seems fine. Very good.

847
00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:55.760
Yes. we're ready.
Let's just hope somebody will show up.

848
00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:59.600
Always positive. aren't you?

849
00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:01.240
What are you doing?

850
00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:04.400
Girls. you'll kill it tonight.

851
00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:07.800
The event is advertised
all over Faenza and Imola.

852
00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:09.680
Even the cashier knew about it.

853
00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:11.160
It's not enough.

854
00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:13.320
people also need to come here.

855
00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:15.600
We only have 15 reservations so far.

856
00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:19.760
Including your parents. your friends.
and a few relatives.

857
00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:22.160
Damn it.

858
00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:23.920
How is that possible?

859
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.520
We've advertised it in Faenza
and its surroundings.

860
00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:28.800
everybody knows about it. Check again.

861
00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:32.400
Oh. I forgot about our two daughters

862
00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:34.920
and the restaurant landlady. We're 18.

863
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.400
I can ask my brothers. if you want.

864
00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:41.680
They're always watching TV. but maybe
I can convince them for one night.

865
00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:43.960
See? Everybody's at home.

866
00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:46.480
Nobody enjoys going out anymore.

867
00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:50.120
People don't want to share anymore
because they don't know how to.

868
00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:54.960
It drives me crazy.
It's unbelievable. Aren't you bothered?

869
00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:58.280
Don't you feel terribly angry?

870
00:57:58.360 --> 00:57:59.520
It's not fair.

871
00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:04.280
I can't take it anymore. I feel trapped.

872
00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:07.280
It's like you just have to survive.

873
00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:09.880
I won't accept that. I want to live.

874
00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:13.520
Tonight we'll have a hell of a night.
All of us!

875
00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:16.440
I want you all fired up!
I'll go get dressed now.

876
00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:26.680
"Mom ranting about music."

877
00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:49.200
I'd like to mock up…

878
00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:51.800
ROME. MARCH 2021
PRELIMINARY MEETING FOR THE NEW ALBUM

879
00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:54.560
…the release of the album in October.

880
00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:58.760
Because by then. Paola will have been
in school for a month

881
00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:00.120
-Yes.
-So…

882
00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:04.080
Helps me to have time
to spend with my daughter. too.

883
00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:06.560
since she's my priority.

884
00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:11.320
So… let's say I deliver it
by the end of July.

885
00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:15.240
I'd rather shoot the videoclip
between July and August.

886
00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:17.240
because Paola won't be in school.

887
00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:18.600
Okay.

888
00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:22.080
How soon should we deliver
the first five songs?

889
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:26.560
The ideal would be
to do it within six months.

890
00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:38.240
Between one thing and another. I've been
noting down songs since January 8th.

891
00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:40.320
but maybe they're too many.

892
00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:42.720
-How many are they?
-More than 1000.

893
00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:48.120
But I still feel stuck.

894
00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:50.240
You have the artist's block.

895
00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:52.000
The artist's block.

896
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.120
No. I don't know. It's weird.

897
00:59:56.800 --> 01:00:00.080
I feel like I've already said everything.
I'm afraid to…

898
01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:03.760
I don't know. Sometimes I undervalue
and belittle myself.

899
01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:05.880
I don't know why.

900
01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:07.560
You need to take the mic.

901
01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:11.400
record a lot of samples
and decide what you feel…

902
01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.440
What inspires you.

903
01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:15.920
I don't know. in this period…

904
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.680
I'm afraid to…

905
01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:20.240
Once you start singing again…

906
01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:23.840
I think everything will be all right.

907
01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:26.680
-I don't know.
-It's better to get back in the saddle.

908
01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:35.960
After winning the Golden Globe.

909
01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:40.320
I felt like that was it. I mean…

910
01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:41.720
What's more than that?

911
01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:46.280
I felt like I had nothing to do anymore.

912
01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:49.160
I needed to know
there's something waiting for me.

913
01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:51.720
that I didn't know and I hadn't done yet.

914
01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:57.880
Then something overwhelming happened.

915
01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:01.640
It's time. Paola. come here.

916
01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:11.880
The nomination for an Oscar.

917
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.520
Mom's nominated for an Oscar! Love!

918
01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:17.360
Yay. guys!

919
01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:19.400
Are you happy. love?

920
01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:23.720
It was an atomic bomb.

921
01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:25.400
My head's spinning.

922
01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:29.920
Then. I started to feel
something inside that…

923
01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:34.560
I had never experienced before.

924
01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:36.920
Let's celebrate!

925
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.520
It was a struggle

926
01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:42.160
which went from exhilaration…

927
01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:45.680
We're going to the Oscars!

928
01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:47.440
…to concern.

929
01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:49.240
Dad? What happened?

930
01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:51.400
Why do we have to go?

931
01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:53.840
Is dad crying?

932
01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.800
I feel a huge responsibility

933
01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:58.800
representing my country.

934
01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:01.000
You'll have a heart attack. Hold on.

935
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.640
Don't worry.

936
01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.160
And on the other hand.

937
01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:07.840
I was scared.

938
01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:10.240
I don't want to go.

939
01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:12.800
Don't worry. We won't go. we'll stay home.

940
01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:16.120
Paola is crying.
she doesn't want to go to LA.

941
01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:25.160
Something weird was happening in me.
I was really torn.

942
01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:26.480
Yes. but…

943
01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:29.040
Yes. but I…

944
01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:31.800
I don't want to go. I don't feel like it.

945
01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:33.800
I didn't want to go.

946
01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:36.640
they didn't give me the visa
for Paola to go.

947
01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:39.040
so I thought that coincidence

948
01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:42.360
was like an omen.

949
01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:46.600
In Covid times? I'll be really far away.

950
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.240
I don't know. I feel like…

951
01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:53.640
I can't breathe.

952
01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:00.080
Every time I get nominated
or win an award.

953
01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:02.120
a part of me feels uncomfortable.

954
01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:06.840
Because an award is a big responsibility.

955
01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:10.160
We've won again. Italy.

956
01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:14.880
It makes you feel
like you have to do more.

957
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.360
Like you have to give back to people
and life everything you've received.

958
01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:25.160
And I never feel I did.

959
01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:31.680
Because what I've received is too big.

960
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.120
It's too much.

961
01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:38.920
Sometimes I still feel like…

962
01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:42.040
when I was a kid in Solarolo.

963
01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.160
I mean…

964
01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:48.320
I don't know why this happened to me.

965
01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.960
Everybody kept telling me I had to go.

966
01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:07.320
But I was feeling very torn inside.

967
01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:13.240
Then. Paola came to me

968
01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:19.600
and said.
"Mom. if you don't go it's a mistake.

969
01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:23.760
"I'm happy. I'll wait for you at home
with grandpa. Go."

970
01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:28.760
So. I went.

971
01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:31.760
I went to Los Angeles.

972
01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:39.800
APRIL 2021

973
01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:09.120
Inside this beautiful dress.

974
01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:12.320
they have sewn a small pocket

975
01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:13.800
for my magic wand.

976
01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:17.400
It was a gift from my friend Giuseppe

977
01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:19.880
for my first nomination to the Grammys.

978
01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:23.160
He said it would bring me luck.

979
01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:27.280
So. every time I get a nomination.

980
01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.640
I bring it with me ever since.

981
01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.440
I bring Giuseppe with me.

982
01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:33.440
Here it is.

983
01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:38.520
Nobody knows. nobody can see it. but I do.

984
01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:55.800
-I just broke a tooth.
-I want a candy.

985
01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:57.680
-I only have this one.
-Thanks.

986
01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:06.280
I should warm up my voice.

987
01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:07.480
Go ahead.

988
01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:12.160
No. Yes. first…

989
01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:47.680
There's more subtle notes in falsetto.

990
01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:48.880
Yes. but…

991
01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:57.640
-Will we do well?
-We'll do great.

992
01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:00.920
-Right?
-Yes.

993
01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:03.720
Yes. of course.

994
01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:09.440
I swear I'm not nervous.

995
01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:11.920
Why would you be nervous?

996
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.800
You know it's not like me.

997
01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:15.080
Of course.

998
01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:18.280
It's so easy.

999
01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:20.320
But I'll be scared to death in there.

1000
01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:21.240
Well…

1001
01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:35.400
Hey. look.

1002
01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:38.520
What happened?

1003
01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:42.240
Everybody showed up
after your rant video on social media.

1004
01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:43.360
It went viral.

1005
01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:46.480
What video? I didn't record any video.

1006
01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:51.800
It was you. huh?

1007
01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:53.400
Sing well. Mom.

1008
01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.040
Yes. sweetheart.

1009
01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:57.880
I'll sing for you.

1010
01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:03.520
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

1011
01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:05.960
Hi. Mom. Hi. Dad. Hi. Silvia.

1012
01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:08.720
-Hi. friends.
-Hi!

1013
01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:15.680
Thank you very much.

1014
01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:19.400
Are you ready?

1015
01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:23.720
We're shaking here.
but we're all very happy.

1016
01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:26.280
I want to live this adventure with you.

1017
01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:28.640
I'm really excited.

1018
01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:34.560
Tonight we'll sing a lot of songs

1019
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.040
and we hope you'll be happy here with us.

1020
01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:42.640
I'd say it's time to start.

1021
01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:50.000
I don't know

1022
01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:52.960
I don't know

1023
01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:02.960
What your destiny is

1024
01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:08.560
But if you want

1025
01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:11.400
If you want me

1026
01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:15.880
I am here

1027
01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:19.520
Nobody sees you

1028
01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:21.520
I do

1029
01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:28.320
I want you to know

1030
01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:32.360
That you're seen

1031
01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:37.280
Bravo!

1032
01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:49.480
No. I can't look! I can't!

1033
01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:56.160
-Let me go.
-No…

1034
01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:59.080
Nothing.

1035
01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:01.680
The one I said won.

1036
01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:05.920
Too bad.

1037
01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:08.520
-What?
-Someone else won.

1038
01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:12.400
Well. whatever.

1039
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:15.320
It is what it is.

1040
01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:20.400
-Daddy?
-Yes. hi.

1041
01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:22.480
I know you're tired.

1042
01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:24.960
I'm sorry I kept you awake all night.

1043
01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:27.400
But I'm so happy. Dad.

1044
01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:30.480
I mean… what an adventure!

1045
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.080
It was good anyway.

1046
01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:34.840
What did Paola say?

1047
01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:36.760
-Paola…
-Was she asleep?

1048
01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:39.840
No. she watched it all. she liked it.
She was happy anyway.

1049
01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:43.200
This is an important lesson for her

1050
01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:46.360
because for a kid.
it's not that healthy to see…

1051
01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:48.880
-Of course.
-…their parents always winning.

1052
01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:51.520
I'm happy. Dad. Believe me.

1053
01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:55.920
You know that if I don't win
something I really want.

1054
01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.920
I'm very angry afterwards.

1055
01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.120
But this time I feel free
of a huge burden.

1056
01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:03.640
Okay. no problem at all.

1057
01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:05.160
I…

1058
01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:08.280
I just want to go home.
I'll go eat a burger now.

1059
01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:12.480
-Okay.
-And then I'm coming home!

1060
01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:13.600
To my daughter!

1061
01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:28.680
Thank you very much.

1062
01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:49.400
It's good.

1063
01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:53.840
My love. we deserve…

1064
01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:56.400
a big kiss.

1065
01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:33.080
Wow.

1066
01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:46.920
Hey…

1067
01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:50.800
Remember you're eating burger and fries

1068
01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:53.120
with an Oscar nominee.

1069
01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:54.200
That's right.

1070
01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:58.160
How does it feel to be
with an Oscar nominee?

1071
01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:02.000
Lucky me.

1072
01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:05.720
-Nothing has changed.
-Yeah.

1073
01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:11.200
If you'd won the Oscar
it would've been better.

1074
01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:12.960
Well…

1075
01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:16.280
-I'm happy anyway.
-That's good.

1076
01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:23.120
You know this won't happen again. right?

1077
01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:24.760
I think you're wrong.

1078
01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:28.200
This was only the first night
of many more to come.

1079
01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:30.120
We just need a theme.

1080
01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:32.360
and then we go straight to the goal.

1081
01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:35.280
Do whatever you want.
but I'm closing this place.

1082
01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:37.800
As long as we pay the rent. you can't.

1083
01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:40.320
And nobody can stop us piano bar girls.

1084
01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:43.160
Right. Excuse me.

1085
01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:51.000
I'm not so convinced.
but I like believing in you.

1086
01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:52.880
You should.

1087
01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:54.240
-Are you going?
-Yes.

1088
01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:55.840
-You're coming?
-No.

1089
01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:00.280
Marcello went home with Irene.
but I don't want to go home now.

1090
01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:03.480
-I'll stay here a bit longer.
-Okay. Bye.

1091
01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:07.080
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

1092
01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:08.200
It was magical.

1093
01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:09.720
-Bye.
-Bye.

1094
01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:47.560
Marco has left and will never come back

1095
01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:52.280
The 7:30 am train without him

1096
01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:57.520
Is a soulless. metal heart

1097
01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:09.120
I wonder if you'll think about me

1098
01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:13.200
If you never talk to your parents

1099
01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:26.400
It's not possible to divide

1100
01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:31.640
The story of us two

1101
01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:41.200
Loneliness

1102
01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:49.880
My biggest success of this past year

1103
01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:52.360
has been showing my daughter

1104
01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:55.880
that her mom both won and lost.

1105
01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:58.880
Because that's how life is.

1106
01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:13.360
Trying to imagine a different me

1107
01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:15.360
has reminded me

1108
01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:19.640
I don't need a big stage to be happy.

1109
01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.320
Happiness lies in our passions

1110
01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:30.120
and in being able

1111
01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:32.600
to love ourselves.

1112
01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:36.120
Whatever…

1113
01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:38.920
our destiny is.

1114
01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:05.520
PLEASED TO MEET YOU
