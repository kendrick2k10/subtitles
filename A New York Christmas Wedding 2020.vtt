00:11:09.545 --> 00:11:11.796
I did not get to spend a lot
of Christmases with my family.

182
00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:13.090
and this is just...

183
00:11:15.634 --> 00:11:16.885
I'm sorry.

184
00:11:19.137 --> 00:11:21.432
Jennifer. I'm sorry
your family's gone.

185
00:11:21.473 --> 00:11:24.809
but I'm trying to throw
the wedding of the century

186
00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:28.647
for you and David. and
with only five months.

187
00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:30.065
Yeah. well. it
just seems to be

188
00:11:30.107 --> 00:11:31.567
more about you than us.

189
00:11:31.609 --> 00:11:35.320
No. now. see. that's
where you're wrong.

190
00:11:35.362 --> 00:11:39.366
You only get married once.
and it has to be special.

191
00:11:39.408 --> 00:11:40.951
Isn't that right. Jeremy?

192
00:11:42.453 --> 00:11:44.455
Absolutely.

193
00:11:44.496 --> 00:11:45.788
Maybe special
can mean something

194
00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.707
a little bit more intimate.

195
00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:49.751
[Alison chuckles]

196
00:11:49.793 --> 00:11:50.793
David is the heir

197
00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:53.297
to a Fortune 500 company.

198
00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:56.383
There is nothing
intimate about that.

199
00:11:57.259 --> 00:11:59.177
Honey. the broccolini.

200
00:12:05.559 --> 00:12:07.311
[Alison] Now. you were saying?

201
00:12:11.982 --> 00:12:12.983
Nothing.

202
00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:15.193
Good.

203
00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:16.487
Excuse me.

204
00:12:19.448 --> 00:12:20.865
[David sighs]

205
00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:31.293
[David sighs]

206
00:12:34.463 --> 00:12:35.547
[David] Jenn.
where are you going?

207
00:12:35.589 --> 00:12:36.590
I'm going for a run.

208
00:12:36.632 --> 00:12:38.091
I need some fresh air.

209
00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:39.426
[David] You can't
just leave like that.

210
00:12:39.468 --> 00:12:40.885
[Jennifer] I can't?

211
00:12:40.927 --> 00:12:42.554
Jennifer. come on.

212
00:12:42.596 --> 00:12:44.431
Why is it that
every time your mother

213
00:12:44.473 --> 00:12:47.184
comes around. you just sit
and behave like a little boy?

214
00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:49.019
She's my mother.

215
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.979
[Jennifer] Well. it'd be nice if
you'd just defend me for once.

216
00:12:51.021 --> 00:12:53.273
I do defend you. I'm also
not gauging for a fight.

217
00:12:53.315 --> 00:12:54.566
[Jennifer] I'm
not fighting. David.

218
00:12:54.608 --> 00:12:57.819
[David] Jennifer.
be reasonable.

219
00:12:57.861 --> 00:13:01.281
Honestly. David. who has
a wedding on Christmas Eve?

220
00:13:01.323 --> 00:13:03.825
It is absurd. it is selfish.

221
00:13:03.866 --> 00:13:04.993
it's not even us.

222
00:13:05.703 --> 00:13:07.663
I know.

223
00:13:07.705 --> 00:13:08.664
I would be more than happy

224
00:13:08.706 --> 00:13:10.040
to go down to City Hall

225
00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:12.376
and have something small
on any other date.

226
00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:14.085
Yes. but--

227
00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:15.962
[Alison] Is
everything all right?

228
00:13:16.755 --> 00:13:18.298
Yes. Mother.

229
00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:19.717
- give us a minute.
- Jennifer. did I upset you?

230
00:13:19.758 --> 00:13:21.426
Mom!

231
00:13:21.468 --> 00:13:22.469
A minute.

232
00:13:26.348 --> 00:13:28.141
Jennifer. come on.

233
00:13:28.183 --> 00:13:31.478
Babe. I love you so much.
but this is too much for me.

Sir. sir. sir. are you okay?

- Yeah.
- He came outta nowhere!

247
00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:31.871
You saw that. right. he did.

248
00:14:31.913 --> 00:14:33.749
[Jennifer] Sir. sir. sir.
don't move. Let me call 911.

249
00:14:33.791 --> 00:14:35.041
No. no. no. no. no.
please. don't. I'm fine.

250
00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:36.876
- Are you sure?
- Yes. I'm fine.

251
00:14:36.918 --> 00:14:38.712
Yeah. he said he's sure.
he's fine. don't call the cops.

252
00:14:38.754 --> 00:14:40.464
- What. I'm just saying.
- Anyway. let me just help you.

253
00:14:40.505 --> 00:14:43.925
- Is this Azrael Gabison?
- Are you cool? I'm gonna go.

254
00:14:43.966 --> 00:14:45.135
Don't you know not to touch
other people's belongings?

255
00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:47.053
Sorry. I'm just trying to help.

256
00:14:47.095 --> 00:14:48.722
- Sir. can you go get
your insurance card?
- What for? He just--

257
00:14:48.764 --> 00:14:50.641
- He said he's fine!
- Sir. please. just go

258
00:14:50.682 --> 00:14:51.933
and get your insurance card!

259
00:14:51.975 --> 00:14:53.226
Okay.

260
00:14:53.268 --> 00:14:54.894
God. can I help
you pick up anything?

261
00:14:54.936 --> 00:14:57.230
- [Azrael] No. no. no.
- [Jennifer] Is this your pen?

262
00:14:57.272 --> 00:14:59.023
[Azrael] I'm okay. thank you.

263
00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:03.153
Fuck that.

264
00:15:03.821 --> 00:15:05.530
- Hey!
- Sorry!

265
00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:07.783
- Did you get his license plate?
- It's a stolen car.

266
00:15:07.825 --> 00:15:09.326
That's why he ran.
Don't worry about him.

267
00:15:09.367 --> 00:15:10.661
What? But we need
to call the police!

268
00:15:10.702 --> 00:15:12.078
No. we don't. I'm fine.

269
00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.038
Seriously. what if
you have a concussion?

270
00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.332
I don't have a concussion.

271
00:15:15.373 --> 00:15:16.750
Yeah. but that's
what everyone says

272
00:15:16.792 --> 00:15:18.000
until they realize they
had a concussion.

273
00:15:18.042 --> 00:15:19.419
God. help me.
okay. I gotta go.

274
00:15:19.461 --> 00:15:21.045
What. please.
please. please. please.

275
00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:23.674
Let me just walk with
you for a little bit.

276
00:15:23.715 --> 00:15:25.634
I just wanna make
sure you're okay.

277
00:15:25.676 --> 00:15:28.219
Okay. sure. if you must.

278
00:15:30.848 --> 00:15:32.098
Does anything hurt?

279
00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.476
No. I'm fine. thank you.

00:15:34.518 --> 00:15:35.268
You sure?

Yes.

282
00:15:36.978 --> 00:15:40.440
You're not even
dirty. that's amazing.

283
00:15:40.482 --> 00:15:42.776
Yeah. girl. I'm good.
I'm gifted.

284
00:15:51.702 --> 00:15:54.454
- It's pretty ironic.
- What is?

285
00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:57.081
They make such a big deal
about texting and driving.

286
00:15:57.123 --> 00:15:59.209
No one mentions
texting and biking.

287
00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:00.794
I wasn't texting.

288
00:16:00.836 --> 00:16:02.671
[Jennifer] All accidents
are caused by texting.

289
00:16:02.713 --> 00:16:04.715
Girl. accidents can
happen for any reason

290
00:16:04.756 --> 00:16:06.383
at any time anywhere.

291
00:16:06.424 --> 00:16:07.718
To anyone.

292
00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:10.595
[chuckling]

293
00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:13.348
So it's...

294
00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:14.641
kinda late for
you to be

295
00:16:14.683 --> 00:16:17.561
running around
these streets alone.

296
00:16:17.602 --> 00:16:20.063
Yeah. I just needed
to get some fresh air.

297
00:16:20.856 --> 00:16:22.482
What's wrong?

298
00:16:24.818 --> 00:16:28.196
My soon-to-be in-laws
are in town. and yeah.

299
00:16:28.238 --> 00:16:29.573
How soon?

300
00:16:29.614 --> 00:16:32.826
Months. maybe Christmas Eve.

301
00:16:32.868 --> 00:16:34.327
That's exciting.

302
00:16:34.369 --> 00:16:36.914
Everybody loves a
Christmas wedding.

303
00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:43.545
- Do you wanna talk about it?
- Nope.

304
00:16:43.587 --> 00:16:46.005
Girl. come on. let it all out.

305
00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:48.341
I don't know you.
you don't know me.

306
00:16:48.383 --> 00:16:49.426
No judgment here.

307
00:16:50.969 --> 00:16:52.721
Okay.

308
00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:59.310
David. my fiancé. I love him.

309
00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:01.939
and I look forward
to marrying him.

310
00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:06.401
Okay. so what's the issue?

311
00:17:06.443 --> 00:17:08.695
A Christmas wedding?

312
00:17:08.737 --> 00:17:11.072
Used to be my favorite holiday.

313
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:15.118
Decorating. baking cookies.

314
00:17:15.159 --> 00:17:16.620
especially the tree.

315
00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:20.999
To make a long story short.

316
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.961
my mother passed when I was 15.

317
00:17:24.002 --> 00:17:25.963
Then it was just me and my dad.

318
00:17:26.922 --> 00:17:28.256
And then me and my best friend

319
00:17:28.298 --> 00:17:30.049
got into a horrible
fight around Christmas

320
00:17:30.091 --> 00:17:32.677
and never spoke
again because of me.

321
00:17:33.637 --> 00:17:35.806
My dad passed and...

322
00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:41.394
I just have a really
hard time around Christmas.

323
00:17:41.436 --> 00:17:42.520
You know. they never tell you

324
00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:43.939
that when your parents die.

325
00:17:43.981 --> 00:17:46.483
a part of you dies
alongside with them.

326
00:17:49.611 --> 00:17:52.906
Hey. you're still living.

327
00:17:52.948 --> 00:17:57.995
and when I say living.
I mean living living.

328
00:17:58.036 --> 00:18:00.455
Look at you. girl. come on.

329
00:18:00.497 --> 00:18:02.457
And. I mean. you gotta trust

330
00:18:02.499 --> 00:18:06.336
that they're all still here.
watching over you. you know?

331
00:18:06.377 --> 00:18:11.215
Yeah. but David's mom
has made it very clear that.

332
00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:13.343
with my dad being
gone and their paying.

333
00:18:13.384 --> 00:18:14.678
that I have no say.

334
00:18:14.719 --> 00:18:15.971
[Azrael] Because
they're rich and bossy.

335
00:18:16.013 --> 00:18:19.098
See. I knew you'd understand.

336
00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.182
[Azrael chuckles]

337
00:18:24.354 --> 00:18:25.563
Can I be honest with you?

338
00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:26.648
No.

339
00:18:27.899 --> 00:18:29.442
Okay. maybe.

340
00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:32.570
You shouldn't underestimate

341
00:18:32.612 --> 00:18:35.197
the power of love
around Christmas.

342
00:18:35.239 --> 00:18:36.324
It's magical.

343
00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:42.413
Did you have a love
around Christmas?

344
00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:44.415
[chuckles] It's complicated.

345
00:18:44.457 --> 00:18:45.959
Okay.

346
00:18:46.001 --> 00:18:48.127
Look...

347
00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:52.173
You need to look
around you. really look.

348
00:18:52.215 --> 00:18:56.302
and you'll see
that life is full of

349
00:18:56.344 --> 00:18:58.304
moments of happiness
and signs of hope.

350
00:18:58.346 --> 00:19:00.223
I mean. your kindness
to me proves that.

351
00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:03.393
And when you wake up tomorrow--

352
00:19:03.434 --> 00:19:05.311
- Oh. gosh. tomorrow--
- Can I finish. please?

353
00:19:05.353 --> 00:19:06.521
Sorry.

354
00:19:07.564 --> 00:19:09.232
When you wake up tomorrow.

355
00:19:09.273 --> 00:19:13.028
if you look around.
you really look.

356
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:16.280
you will see endless
possibilities

357
00:19:16.322 --> 00:19:19.034
and the answers to your

All right. maybe you
don't have a concussion.

363

but I do recommend that
you still go see a doctor.

And I recommend
you get some rest.

Jenny and I have
decided to get married.

615
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:35.741
and. a few months
ago. we all spoke

616
00:34:35.783 --> 00:34:37.284
about our history
here at the church

617
00:34:37.326 --> 00:34:38.995
and wanting you to marry us.

618
00:34:39.036 --> 00:34:40.621
and I know you said.
because of the Church's

619
00:34:40.663 --> 00:34:42.164
stance on same sex marriage.

620
00:34:42.205 --> 00:34:45.542
that the best you
could do is support us.

621
00:34:45.584 --> 00:34:46.836
That's correct.

622
00:34:46.877 --> 00:34:50.506
But the Supreme
Court ruled. Father.

623
00:34:50.547 --> 00:34:53.091
and Pope Francis
welcomes all. and he

624
00:34:53.133 --> 00:34:55.594
expects priests
like you to usher

625
00:34:55.636 --> 00:34:58.263
parishes into modern times.

626
00:34:58.305 --> 00:35:00.140
Yes. but...

627
00:35:04.227 --> 00:35:06.605
the author
of marriage is God.

628
00:35:06.647 --> 00:35:09.900
not society. not government.

629
00:35:09.942 --> 00:35:14.030
not man. not your priest.

630
00:35:14.071 --> 00:35:15.990
With all due respect. Father.

631
00:35:16.032 --> 00:35:17.908
there are other churches
in New York City

632
00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:20.536
that are officiating
same sex marriages.

633
00:35:20.577 --> 00:35:22.371
Do you think maybe one of those

634
00:35:22.412 --> 00:35:25.165
- would be better suited to you?
- No!

635
00:35:26.166 --> 00:35:29.252
We were baptized in this church.

636
00:35:29.294 --> 00:35:31.839

our confirmations here.

641
00:35:42.641 --> 00:35:45.602
but not equal.

642
00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:53.402
This is a difficult question
for the Catholic Church.

643
00:35:53.443 --> 00:35:54.862
and it's been more--

644
00:35:54.904 --> 00:35:57.031
How many years have
you been a priest here?

645
00:35:58.448 --> 00:36:01.242
- Twenty-three.
- I know.

646
00:36:01.284 --> 00:36:03.871
Do you remember my senior
year of high school?

647
00:36:04.997 --> 00:36:07.332
I came to you and confessed

648
00:36:07.374 --> 00:36:09.251
about being sexually active.

649
00:36:09.292 --> 00:36:12.379
and you said that
we're all human

650
00:36:12.421 --> 00:36:16.592
and that it'll be okay
because. you said.

651
00:36:16.633 --> 00:36:18.176
even the best of us have sinned.

652
00:36:19.553 --> 00:36:21.221
And yet.

653
00:36:21.262 --> 00:36:24.934

I was pregnant.

654
00:36:27.603 --> 00:36:28.771

655
00:36:30.188 --> 00:36:33.483
Good. because you stood by me.

656
00:36:34.902 --> 00:36:36.737
I was a scared 18-year-old girl

657
00:36:36.779 --> 00:36:40.908
whose old-fashioned Italian
parents disowned her.

658
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:45.287
and I came to you.
I trusted you.

659
00:36:45.328 --> 00:36:47.123
What did you advise me. Father?

660
00:36:48.707 --> 00:36:51.376
You know what I advised you.

661
00:36:51.418 --> 00:36:54.504
And I still stand
by that advice.

662
00:36:54.546 --> 00:36:58.134
Like it or not. you
are and forever will be

664
00:36:59.384 --> 00:37:01.887

00:39:51.181 --> 00:39:54.017
that's how I realized I was gay.

720
00:39:56.853 --> 00:39:59.439
The way you put
things is so simple.

721
00:39:59.481 --> 00:40:00.732
I miss that.

722
00:40:02.943 --> 00:40:05.321
Yeah. that day. for me. was when

723
00:40:05.362 --> 00:40:08.031
I told my dad how
I felt about you.

724
00:40:08.073 --> 00:40:11.534
Oh my God. I saw my dad today!

725
00:40:11.576 --> 00:40:12.744
It was...

726
00:40:14.871 --> 00:40:16.456
You see him every day.

727
00:40:18.541 --> 00:40:19.709
Yeah.

728
00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:25.299
Yeah. I can't believe
you're really here.

729
00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:34.683
Oh. Gabby. arroz con leche.

730
00:40:34.724 --> 00:40:36.101

00:40:36.143 --> 00:40:37.894
Okay. okay. you

Okay. I'm just gonna--

734
00:40:41.648 --> 00:40:44.360
Okay. well. don't eat it
all. it's for your father.

735
00:40:44.401 --> 00:40:45.610
Just a little
taste. a little taste.

736
00:40:45.652 --> 00:40:48.071
What has gotten into you?

00:40:48.113 --> 00:40:49.198

00:41:40.082 --> 00:41:42.167
Anyway. you know. I
went to Father Kelly.

751
00:41:42.209 --> 00:41:43.293
She was with me.

752
00:41:43.335 --> 00:41:45.586
I told him he'd marry us.

753
00:41:45.628 --> 00:41:46.755
Papi. you should
have seen how she

754
00:41:46.796 --> 00:41:47.714
was standing up for herself.

755
00:41:47.756 --> 00:41:49.716
It was so badass.

756
00:41:50.717 --> 00:41:51.885
I'm serious.

757
00:41:51.927 --> 00:41:53.262
I was standing up for us.

758
00:41:54.554 --> 00:41:55.722
Yes.

759
00:41:56.514 --> 00:41:57.557
More wine?

760
00:41:58.350 --> 00:41:59.851
Papi. no more for you.

761
00:41:59.893 --> 00:42:01.311
Your health.

762
00:42:01.353 --> 00:42:03.439
He'll have water.

763
00:42:04.981 --> 00:42:06.024
I got you.

764
00:42:12.989 --> 00:42:14.824
Are you proud of me?

765
00:42:14.866 --> 00:42:16.201
How I turned out?

766
00:42:16.243 --> 00:42:17.744
Yes.

767
00:42:17.786 --> 00:42:20.663
Yeah. but what if
I was to marry a man.

768
00:42:20.705 --> 00:42:23.917

from a rich family?

769
00:42:26.295 --> 00:42:28.588
Todos quieren ser ricos.

Sure. I'm happy if you
marry a rich. good man.

772
00:42:33.802 --> 00:42:38.181
But Gabrielle. she's strong.

773
00:42:38.223 --> 00:42:40.392
You two always laughing.

774
00:42:40.434 --> 00:42:41.935
Mi hija you are lucky.

775
00:42:41.977 --> 00:42:43.145
This is honest.

776
00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:46.148
Oh. no!

777
00:42:46.189 --> 00:42:48.484
[Gabby] Yeah. now I know
why Jenny can't handle hers.

778

You two are my family.

783

You. Papi. you have
been more of a dad

784
00:43:01.246 --> 00:43:02.414
to me than my own.

785
00:43:03.499 --> 00:43:05.459
Thank you for raising us both.

786
00:43:05.501 --> 00:43:06.960
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

787
00:43:07.002 --> 00:43:08.378
No. no. no.

788
00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:12.007
Christmas is my
favorite time of year.

00:43:12.048 --> 00:43:16.470
Love. family. and good spirits!

-Salu.
-Salu!

795
00:43:30.526 --> 00:43:32.152
[TV Reporter]
Reported comments by the Pope

796
00:43:32.194 --> 00:43:35.280
could signal a major shift
for the Catholic Church

797
00:43:35.322 --> 00:43:37.115
and its views on homosexuality.

798
00:43:37.157 --> 00:43:39.451
A survivor of
clerical sexual abuse.

799
00:43:39.493 --> 00:43:41.828
Juan Carlos Cruz. says
that when he told

800
00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:44.206
the Pope he was gay.
the Pope responded.

801
00:43:44.247 --> 00:43:46.916
and I'm quoting now.
"God made you like this.

802
00:43:46.958 --> 00:43:48.668
God loves you like this."

803
00:43:48.709 --> 00:43:51.254
For more. I'm joined by
CNN's Vatican correspondent

804
00:43:51.296 --> 00:43:52.839
Delia Gallagher.

805
00:43:52.881 --> 00:43:54.132
Way too much.

806
00:43:56.718 --> 00:43:58.094
I'm busting my pants.

807
00:43:58.136 --> 00:43:59.596
They're busting open.

808
00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:03.517
Gabby. I'm sorry I
wasn't there for you.

809
00:44:03.559 --> 00:44:06.978
I should've never
stopped talking to you.

810
00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:08.230
Whatever.

811
00:44:08.271 --> 00:44:09.606
That's old. we're past it.

812
00:44:09.647 --> 00:44:11.900
It's not whatever.
can I finish?

813
00:44:13.276 --> 00:44:14.403
Go ahead.

814
00:44:14.444 --> 00:44:15.653
You know that
day that we fought?

815
00:44:15.695 --> 00:44:17.364
[Gabby] Ooh. we
fought many days.

816
00:44:17.406 --> 00:44:18.448
Be more specific.

817
00:44:18.490 --> 00:44:19.657
You know. that day in December

818
00:44:19.699 --> 00:44:21.910
when I wrote that letter.

819
00:44:21.951 --> 00:44:24.996
Oh. that letter
where you told me

820
00:44:25.038 --> 00:44:26.706
never to talk to you again.

821
00:44:27.665 --> 00:44:29.876
You were so stubborn about it.

822
00:44:29.918 --> 00:44:31.587
Yeah. I was upset.

823
00:44:31.628 --> 00:44:34.839
That day was gonna be the day
when I told you how I felt.

824
00:44:34.881 --> 00:44:37.092
and you just dismissed me.

825
00:44:37.133 --> 00:44:38.009
[Gabby] I didn't dismiss you.

826
00:44:38.051 --> 00:44:39.261
Yes. you did.

827
00:44:40.554 --> 00:44:42.764
You are who I heard
in all the love songs

828
00:44:42.805 --> 00:44:46.893
and who I got cute for. like.
dressed up for at school.

829
00:44:46.935 --> 00:44:49.187
I mean. you knew how
important you were to me.

830
00:44:49.229 --> 00:44:51.064
I'm not important
to you anymore?

831
00:44:51.106 --> 00:44:53.567
Of course. you are.

832
00:44:53.609 --> 00:44:57.070
It's just that that
day. the fight.

833
00:44:57.112 --> 00:45:00.156
and you moved. and. yeah.

834
00:45:00.198 --> 00:45:03.076
I've just waited so long
just to be true to you.

835
00:45:03.118 --> 00:45:05.745
You have to be
true to yourself.

836
00:45:05.787 --> 00:45:06.996
That's always been your problem.

837
00:45:07.038 --> 00:45:07.956
Yeah. well. I was trying to.

838
00:45:07.997 --> 00:45:09.291
but it was really hard.

839
00:45:09.332 --> 00:45:11.793
[Gabby] Okay.
you wanna go back?

840
00:45:11.834 --> 00:45:13.920
The only thing I do
remember you telling me

841
00:45:13.962 --> 00:45:16.005
was to drop dead.

842
00:45:16.047 --> 00:45:18.467
You have no idea.

843
00:45:19.509 --> 00:45:21.094
Okay. I was crushed.

844
00:45:21.136 --> 00:45:22.512
I was hurt. too.

845
00:45:22.554 --> 00:45:25.474
You know. I hate that my
family didn't want me.

846
00:45:25.515 --> 00:45:28.393
and then I come to you. and
you don't want me. either.

847
00:45:28.435 --> 00:45:30.312
That was hard for me.

848
00:45:30.353 --> 00:45:33.649
I moved west. by myself.

849
00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:35.233
I couldn't even come
say goodbye to you.

850
00:45:35.275 --> 00:45:36.734
How do you think
that made me feel?

851
00:45:36.776 --> 00:45:38.612
The only person I've ever loved

852
00:45:38.654 --> 00:45:40.780
pretending I didn't exist.

853
00:45:40.822 --> 00:45:43.575
You turned your back on me.

854
00:45:43.617 --> 00:45:44.576
[Jennifer] Yeah.
but you still left.

855
00:45:44.618 --> 00:45:46.827
And I came back!

856
00:45:46.869 --> 00:45:48.371
I came back.

857
00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:53.251
No one's perfect. Jenny.

858
00:45:53.293 --> 00:45:54.544
And. deep down. you
know what you want.

859
00:45:54.586 --> 00:45:56.463
but you're shit
scared to say it.

860
00:45:56.505 --> 00:45:58.881
and after all these years. it's
still the same thing with you.

861
00:45:58.923 --> 00:46:01.718
You hated me. great.
I said I hated you. too.

862
00:46:01.759 --> 00:46:02.719
We moved on.

863
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:04.220
Yeah. but why him?

864
00:46:04.262 --> 00:46:06.598
Jennifer. if you don't stop.

865
00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.099
we can't have our own life

866
00:46:08.141 --> 00:46:10.519
if you keep mentioning
Vinny as if he matters.

867
00:46:14.063 --> 00:46:15.898
It's late.

868
00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:18.360
It's time for you
girls to go home.

869
00:46:24.824 --> 00:46:25.908
[Gabby] Thanks for dinner.

870
00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:27.369
Come here.

871
00:46:35.251 --> 00:46:36.670
Thanks for dinner. Dad.

872
00:46:38.129 --> 00:46:39.506
I don't wanna leave you.

873
00:46:40.716 --> 00:46:41.841
I'm okay.

874
00:46:42.634 --> 00:46:45.387
You go to talk to her.

875
00:46:57.857 --> 00:46:59.484
Stay there.

876
00:47:05.948 --> 00:47:07.033
Read it.

877
00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:18.754
Out loud.

878
00:47:25.093 --> 00:47:28.805
"December 5th. 1999.

879
00:47:28.846 --> 00:47:32.601
Dear Gabby. I
don't want you to..."

880
00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:40.024
Go on.

881
00:47:44.028 --> 00:47:46.406
"I don't want
you to write back.

882
00:47:46.448 --> 00:47:49.284
call me. or keep in touch.

883
00:47:49.325 --> 00:47:50.786
You hurt me so much.

884
00:47:50.827 --> 00:47:52.704
I don't want to
feel this way again

885
00:47:52.746 --> 00:47:55.248
about anyone. even you.

886
00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:58.418
When you see me.
don't talk to me.

887
00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:01.003
You're dead to me. Jennifer."

888
00:48:02.922 --> 00:48:04.132
Yeah.

889
00:48:05.467 --> 00:48:07.343
I shouldn't have written that.

890
00:48:07.385 --> 00:48:10.430
But you wrote it.
and you were honest.

891
00:48:11.972 --> 00:48:13.642
[Jennifer] Yeah.
it was a mistake.

892
00:48:13.683 --> 00:48:19.397
Hey. I'm not
upset. I'm past it.

893
00:48:19.439 --> 00:48:23.610
And I respected your decision
until I couldn't anymore

894
00:48:27.196 --> 00:48:29.073
because I love you too much.

895
00:48:31.242 --> 00:48:32.577
Do you understand that?

896
00:48:33.369 --> 00:48:34.496
Yes.

897
00:48:34.537 --> 00:48:36.289

[Jennifer] Right.

1254
01:13:23.358 --> 01:13:28.238
Well. I would like
some information on
a past parishioner.

1255
01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:30.198
Oh. uh. what is their name?

1256
01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:33.160
It's Gabby. I mean.
Gabrielle Vernaci.

1257
01:13:33.201 --> 01:13:36.830
It's V-E-R-N-A-C-I.

1258
01:13:36.871 --> 01:13:40.625
Gabrielle and I were
married. we were baptized

1259
01:13:40.667 --> 01:13:43.337
and confirmed here.

1260
01:13:48.758 --> 01:13:51.136

had is still here.

know her full name.

It was very sad. her story.

1268
01:14:14.326 --> 01:14:16.119
Yeah. well. her
family never told

1269
01:14:16.161 --> 01:14:18.454
me exactly what happened.
which is why we are here.

my fiancé David.

[David] Hello.

1273
01:14:25.753 --> 01:14:29.174
I'm not sure. but I
think Gabby was pregnant.

1274
01:14:29.216 --> 01:14:31.592
and I don't know the full story.

1275
01:14:31.634 --> 01:14:33.928
All I know is that for 20 years.

1276
01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:36.681
no one has told me
what actually happened.

1277
01:14:36.723 --> 01:14:40.560
Well. Father Kelly
counseled her for weeks

1278
01:14:40.601 --> 01:14:42.770
to keep her child.

1279
01:14:42.812 --> 01:14:46.191
In fact. he even
arranged for Gabby

1280
01:14:46.233 --> 01:14:49.194
to go to a home
for single mothers

1281
01:14:49.236 --> 01:14:52.030
out west to have her baby.

1282
01:14:52.072 --> 01:14:53.948
You see. her family
had disowned her.

1283
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:56.243
so she came to the
church for help.

1284
01:15:00.997 --> 01:15:02.707
Well. unfortunately. her baby

1285
01:15:02.749 --> 01:15:04.334
didn't have much of a chance.

1286
01:15:04.376 --> 01:15:09.381
She gave birth to a
stillborn at 29 weeks.

1287
01:15:09.423 --> 01:15:12.550

Azrael Gabison.

1289

walked through a crosswalk

1290
01:15:19.807 --> 01:15:21.226
and was hit by a car.

1291
01:15:24.438 --> 01:15:27.107

she absentmindedly

1292
01:15:27.148 --> 01:15:29.192

out into traffic.

Sadly. no one's heard
from Father Kelly

1295
01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:43.331
since he was removed
from the ministry

1296
01:15:43.373 --> 01:15:49.628
for officiating many
private same sex marriages.

1297
01:15:49.670 --> 01:15:51.005
He was a romantic.

1298
01:15:51.047 --> 01:15:55.093

wife Alice and I.

1299
