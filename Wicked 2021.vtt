3
00:00:28.385 --> 00:00:30.592
Sometimes I wonder
what it would be like...

4
00:00:32.196 --> 00:00:35.272
to be like everyone
walking up and down the
street...

5
00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:38.716
living in blissful ignorance...

6
00:00:40.788 --> 00:00:47.174
having friends where memories
instead of secrets linked us
together.

7
00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:52.223
If I had been born to
any other family.

8
00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.198
so many things would
be different.

9
00:00:57.071 --> 00:01:01.083
But as my foster mom
used to say.

10
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.827
"If wishes were fishes.
we'd all cast nets."

11
00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:37.224
Give me.

12
00:01:37.291 --> 00:01:39.330
I believe the correct
response is:

13
00:01:39.397 --> 00:01:41.136
I love you so much for getting
me iced coffee.

14
00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:45.918
You know I could totally
just ninja kick your ass and
take the coffee.

15
00:01:46.921 --> 00:01:47.990
But you'd never do such a thing

16
00:01:48.057 --> 00:01:51.266
'cause I'm your best-est
friend-est
in the world-est.

17
00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:55.178
Okay. so. I have a hot date
Saturday night.

18
00:01:55.245 --> 00:01:56.516
Well. hopefully. a hot date.

19
00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:59.792
but David has me on the schedule
to work the Quarter.

20
00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:01.163
so...

21
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.002
You want me to take your shift
in the Quarter?

22
00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:05.008
- Mm-hm.
- On a Saturday?

23
00:02:05.075 --> 00:02:06.411
Smack dab in tourist hell?

24
00:02:07.081 --> 00:02:08.251
Pretty please?

25
00:02:09.655 --> 00:02:10.625
Sure. Not like a I
have a hot date.

26
00:02:12.096 --> 00:02:15.506
I mean you could if you went out
more
than once a year.

27
00:02:15.573 --> 00:02:18.749
I'd totally do you.
You know I swing both ways.

28
00:02:18.816 --> 00:02:20.253
I like boys...

29
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.961
and can we not talk
about them or swinging?

30
00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:27.007
This conversation is gonna lead
me
to dwell on the severe

31
00:02:27.074 --> 00:02:28.679
lack of orgasms in my life.

32
00:02:28.745 --> 00:02:32.958
Fine. I don’t know. I don’t get
why you’re going to college.

33
00:02:33.025 --> 00:02:36.803
I mean. you already have a job
that pays extraordinarily well.

34
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.213
even if it does have the
shortest life span
of any job out there.

35
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.663
but it's just like. another
reason
not to waste your time on...
that.

36
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.772
Okay. how about a
friendly wager?

37
00:02:49.608 --> 00:02:50.845
On?

38
00:02:50.912 --> 00:02:54.155
Most kills by one in
the morning.

39
00:02:55.158 --> 00:02:57.699
Deal. what do I get when I win?

40
00:02:57.766 --> 00:02:58.134
If you win.

41
00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:00.875
I'll bring you iced
coffee for a week.

42
00:03:01.611 --> 00:03:03.382
and if I win...

43
00:03:17.491 --> 00:03:19.029
Fucking fae.

44
00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:22.139
That one's mine.
Thanks for Saturday.

45
00:03:22.206 --> 00:03:24.914
I'll get laid and you can live
vicariously through me.

46
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:25.950
Peace out.

47
00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.583
Your whole world is
about to end.

48
00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:29.072
As last words go. I've
heard better.

49
00:04:30.008 --> 00:04:30.978
I'm sure you have.

50
00:04:37.264 --> 00:04:38.702
Kind of tacky to bring a gun
to a knife fight.

51
00:04:39.872 --> 00:04:41.610
And stupid to let you
walk up behind me

52
00:04:41.677 --> 00:04:44.652
and stab me in the back
like the last one just did.

53
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.224
Good point.

54
00:04:47.796 --> 00:04:48.932
You're not a normal fae.

55
00:04:49.667 --> 00:04:51.673
And you're not a stupid cow.

56
00:04:52.443 --> 00:04:54.783
Oh... Wait. I know what you are.

57
00:04:56.321 --> 00:04:57.291
A dead fae.

58
00:05:02.372 --> 00:05:04.746
How weak do you think I am. cow?

59
00:05:29.687 --> 00:05:31.827
Come on. David. come on.

60
00:05:33.867 --> 00:05:37.444
Your call has been forwarded
to an automatic voice message
system.

61
00:05:38.547 --> 00:05:40.052
Someone's triggered the alarm.

62
00:05:40.118 --> 00:05:41.723
Someone's down on the stairs.

63
00:05:43.329 --> 00:05:44.332
She's alive.

64
00:05:49.948 --> 00:05:52.422
And she's staring at me
really intensely.

65
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.033
Who is it?

66
00:05:57.203 --> 00:05:59.310
She kinda looks like
she's from that movie Brave.

67
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.383
The one with the curly.
red hair.

68
00:06:02.786 --> 00:06:05.395
Shit! That'll be Ivy Morgan.

69
00:06:07.266 --> 00:06:09.908
Don't... touch me!

70
00:06:13.352 --> 00:06:15.157
That's not what I usually hear
from the ladies.

71
00:06:16.728 --> 00:06:19.202
- Doc.
- What happened to you. girl?

72
00:06:19.269 --> 00:06:20.473
A fae shot me.

73
00:06:21.543 --> 00:06:24.552
Girl. fae don't use guns.

74
00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:28.196
It was a fae. A fae that didn't
need
glamour to hide its identity.

75
00:06:28.262 --> 00:06:30.235
- What?
- That can't be true.

76
00:06:30.302 --> 00:06:34.080
This fae didn't have silver
skin.
but it had fae eyes.

77
00:06:34.715 --> 00:06:36.488
And it conjured a gun...

78
00:06:36.554 --> 00:06:39.463
- out of thin air.
- I'm thinking you might've hit
your head. girl.

79
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.375
- Let's get you upstairs.
- No. I'm telling you...

80
00:06:57.551 --> 00:06:59.958
I'm assuming this is why
you called me last night?

81
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:06.143
Would've answered. but...
well. Laurie would be downright
pissed

82
00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.182
if I let her hanging if
you get my drift.

83
00:07:09.787 --> 00:07:11.358
I talked to Doc Harris.

84
00:07:11.426 --> 00:07:14.234
He said it was just a flesh
wound
that bled a lot.

85
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.240
Probably made worse by
your running.

86
00:07:16.306 --> 00:07:17.309
I didn't run because
I'm a coward.

87
00:07:17.376 --> 00:07:18.881
I didn't say you are
were coward.

88
00:07:18.948 --> 00:07:20.653
That man had a gun.
you can't fight a bullet.

89
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.194
I'm gonna pull you off rotation
until next Wednesday.

90
00:07:23.261 --> 00:07:24.732
But I'm working for Val
this Saturday.

91
00:07:26.403 --> 00:07:29.914
- I know what you told Harris
and Ren...
- Ren?

92
00:07:29.981 --> 00:07:31.318
Who's Ren?

93
00:07:31.385 --> 00:07:32.221
Ren Owens.

94
00:07:32.288 --> 00:07:34.394
Transferred to our sect
from Colorado.

95
00:07:36.668 --> 00:07:38.239
Are you sure it was a fae. Ivy?

96
00:07:40.847 --> 00:07:43.922
It didn't look like a regular
fae.
but it made a gun appear out of
thin air.

97
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:45.963
- Possible.
- I know what I saw.

98
00:07:46.029 --> 00:07:47.133
And you know me.

99
00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:49.139
Never once have you ever
had to question me.

100
00:07:49.205 --> 00:07:50.676
Except for the time you
ended up in jail.

101
00:07:50.743 --> 00:07:54.990
Except that one time.
but what I'm telling you is the
truth.

102
00:07:55.056 --> 00:07:57.296
And if hitting a fae with iron
does nothing to them.

103
00:07:57.363 --> 00:07:58.968
then they would be unstoppable.

104
00:07:59.035 --> 00:08:02.444
No. They would be an ancient.

105
00:08:10.503 --> 00:08:11.104
I thought they were all sealed
in the Otherworld.

106
00:08:13.077 --> 00:08:18.226
It's possible that a few
could've remained
here undetected. but it is
highly unlikely.

107
00:08:18.627 --> 00:08:20.165
I saw it.

108
00:08:20.232 --> 00:08:22.304
We don't know what
you really saw.

109
00:08:23.675 --> 00:08:24.578
We don't. Ivy.

110
00:08:25.681 --> 00:08:27.453
I'm gonna contact the
other sects.

111
00:08:27.521 --> 00:08:29.827
See if they have any
experiences like this.

112
00:08:29.894 --> 00:08:31.298
but until I hear back from them.

113
00:08:31.365 --> 00:08:32.468
you need to keep this quiet.

114
00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:34.642
We can't tell anyone.

115
00:08:35.711 --> 00:08:37.116
Not even Val.

116
00:08:37.182 --> 00:08:38.352
Do you understand me?

117
00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:40.458
I understand. David.

118
00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:44.404
Did the fae say anything to you?

119
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.513
Just the same old
"your world is about to end "
crap.

120
00:09:05.735 --> 00:09:08.342
Guess who got shot last night
by some punk?

121
00:09:08.409 --> 00:09:09.813
You must've been off your game.

122
00:09:10.716 --> 00:09:13.357
Yeah. And I have bad news.

123
00:09:14.628 --> 00:09:16.199
Well. worse than getting shot
by some punk?

124
00:09:16.934 --> 00:09:18.774
I can't work Saturday night.

125
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.211
David pulled me.

126
00:09:20.278 --> 00:09:22.819
Honey. that is the last thing
you should be worried about.

127
00:09:23.689 --> 00:09:24.157
Want me to swing by?

128
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.569
Nah. I'm just gonna get
cleaned up and sleep.

129
00:09:29.272 --> 00:09:31.010
Be careful. please.

130
00:09:31.077 --> 00:09:32.548
You promised me that. okay?

131
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.520
I'm always careful.

132
00:10:34.065 --> 00:10:36.774
Bite me and I will bury you
alive
in a shoe box.

133
00:10:36.841 --> 00:10:37.977
Where have you been?

134
00:10:38.044 --> 00:10:40.117
You didn't come home.
I thought you were dead.

135
00:10:40.184 --> 00:10:43.494
No one knows about me.
and I would just be left here.
forgotten.

136
00:10:43.561 --> 00:10:44.731
I'd starve. Ivy. starve.

137
00:10:44.798 --> 00:10:46.436
Doesn't look like you
were starving.

138
00:10:46.503 --> 00:10:48.844
I had to eat to get through the
stress
of being abandoned.

139
00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:49.913
I knew where you were.

140
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.186
And you don't engage
in any bow-chick a-wow-wee.

141
00:10:52.254 --> 00:10:53.724
You always come home.

142
00:10:55.764 --> 00:10:56.466
So...

143
00:10:57.134 --> 00:10:58.305
where were you. Ivy Divy?

144
00:10:58.372 --> 00:10:59.642
I got shot last night.

145
00:10:59.709 --> 00:11:03.287
What? You got shot?
Where? How? By who?

146
00:11:03.354 --> 00:11:07.599
Did you cry? I would've cried.
A lot. like. a river of
motherfucking tears.

147
00:11:07.666 --> 00:11:10.708
- A fae shot me.
- When did they start using
guns?

148
00:11:10.776 --> 00:11:13.484
And the fae didn't have
silver skin either.

149
00:11:13.551 --> 00:11:16.091
And it conjured a gun
out of thin air.

150
00:11:16.158 --> 00:11:20.103
And I stabbed him with an iron
stake
and it did nothing.

151
00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:21.541
- Sound like an...
- Ancient?

152
00:11:21.608 --> 00:11:23.882
Oh. they're badass.

153
00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:25.018
Scary.

154
00:11:25.085 --> 00:11:26.623
I've never seen an ancient here.

155
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:29.298
Exactly how long have you been
in this world. Tink?

156
00:11:29.365 --> 00:11:32.073
I hate it when you call me Tink.
evil woman.

157
00:11:35.884 --> 00:11:38.124
Well. you won't tell me
your real name.

158
00:11:38.191 --> 00:11:40.030
It's a good thing you hate the
fae
as much as the Order does

159
00:11:40.097 --> 00:11:42.604
or I may not have rescued you
and harbored you.

160
00:11:42.671 --> 00:11:44.644
I've seen the ancients in
the Otherworld.

161
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:46.181
I've even seen the prince.

162
00:11:46.248 --> 00:11:48.756
He's dreamy. but really scary.

163
00:11:48.823 --> 00:11:50.561
Do you know anything
about the ancients being here?

164
00:11:50.829 --> 00:11:52.334
No.

165
00:11:52.401 --> 00:11:55.242
What about why an ancient
would suddenly make his presence
known?

166
00:11:55.309 --> 00:11:56.078
I have no clue.

167
00:11:57.248 --> 00:12:00.223
You wouldn't lie to me.
would you. Tink?

168
00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:02.664
No. You have Amazon Prime.

169
00:12:03.701 --> 00:12:04.972
Good to know
how I can secure your loyalty.

170
00:12:06.911 --> 00:12:09.317
By the way. while you were
passed out.
there were deliveries for you.

171
00:12:09.385 --> 00:12:09.987
I put them on the counter.

172
00:12:11.156 --> 00:12:12.862
Why did you wait until
now to tell me?

173
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:14.600
But you're okay. right?

174
00:12:14.667 --> 00:12:16.406
You're not gonna die on me
while you sleep?

175
00:12:16.473 --> 00:12:18.880
No one knows about me
so no one will know to come
looking for me.

176
00:12:18.947 --> 00:12:21.286
You know. I already ate the
marshmallows
out of the Lucky Charms.

177
00:12:21.353 --> 00:12:22.524
I'm fine!

178
00:13:01.373 --> 00:13:02.276
Tink. I'm heading out.

179
00:13:03.547 --> 00:13:04.750
You're not going out to work.
are you?

180
00:13:05.352 --> 00:13:06.589
I'm just going out.

181
00:13:07.258 --> 00:13:08.227
I won't be late.

182
00:13:08.294 --> 00:13:09.865
I don't believe you.

183
00:13:10.635 --> 00:13:11.939
You're up to shenanigans.

184
00:13:12.006 --> 00:13:13.610
You want me to bring you back
some beignets?

185
00:13:13.677 --> 00:13:15.048
Would you? For me?

186
00:13:15.115 --> 00:13:16.786
A whole plate for me.
all mine. not yours?

187
00:13:17.154 --> 00:13:18.090
Yes.

188
00:13:18.157 --> 00:13:20.096
Then get the hell out of my face
and get going.

189
00:13:22.036 --> 00:13:23.005
You're welcome.

190
00:13:29.625 --> 00:13:31.831
- Ivy!
- Trent.

191
00:13:31.898 --> 00:13:32.667
Didn't you get shot?

192
00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:36.345
Yeah. but it was just
flesh wound.

193
00:13:36.411 --> 00:13:37.214
Nothing big.

194
00:13:38.451 --> 00:13:40.958
- I'm not working.
- Then why you're here?

195
00:13:42.296 --> 00:13:43.166
Why are you here?

196
00:13:43.867 --> 00:13:44.803
I wanted to see the score.

197
00:13:46.308 --> 00:13:48.916
I caught of couple of fae coming
out of this bar over the last
week.

198
00:13:48.982 --> 00:13:49.985
I wanted to check it out.

199
00:13:50.053 --> 00:13:51.925
I saw fae out here last night.

200
00:13:53.062 --> 00:13:54.800
Thought you said you
weren't working.

201
00:13:54.867 --> 00:13:57.308
Just because I'm checking
something out
doesn't mean I'm working.

202
00:13:57.374 --> 00:13:59.013
Heard you said a fae shot you?

203
00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.283
This wasn't a normal fae. Trent.

204
00:14:01.554 --> 00:14:04.028
I stabbed him with iron and
it did nothing.

205
00:14:04.797 --> 00:14:07.003
That sounds batshit crazy.

206
00:14:07.973 --> 00:14:09.510
Like as crazy as Merle sounds.

207
00:14:09.578 --> 00:14:12.386
Merle was a member of the Order
and you should respect
everything

208
00:14:12.453 --> 00:14:14.024
that woman has sacrificed.

209
00:14:14.092 --> 00:14:16.833
I knew it was a bad idea
when the Order started allowing
females in.

210
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.003
You just can't handle...

211
00:14:18.639 --> 00:14:21.079
Handle that. asshole.

212
00:14:37.596 --> 00:14:38.765
I wouldn't do that!

213
00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:39.969
I'm gonna put you down.

214
00:14:41.206 --> 00:14:42.978
And you're not gonna punch me
or kick me.

215
00:14:43.044 --> 00:14:44.950
Nod your head if you feel me.

216
00:14:50.935 --> 00:14:52.907
I'm sorry for snatching you
off the street. Merida.

217
00:14:52.974 --> 00:14:54.479
but you were about to make
another big mistake

218
00:14:54.545 --> 00:14:55.916
like the one you got you shot.

219
00:14:55.983 --> 00:14:58.089
I didn't make a mistake last
night.
I was doing my job.

220
00:14:58.157 --> 00:14:59.862
The moment you thought
you could engage that fae

221
00:14:59.928 --> 00:15:01.701
you made a mistake.

222
00:15:01.768 --> 00:15:02.937
And you're about to do it again.

223
00:15:03.004 --> 00:15:04.910
I just saved your life.
sweetness.

224
00:15:06.716 --> 00:15:10.059
Wow. you're so
incredibly modest.

225
00:15:10.795 --> 00:15:12.166
Can I make you some cookies?

226
00:15:12.232 --> 00:15:14.138
And you're a one bundle
of kickass hotness.

227
00:15:15.408 --> 00:15:18.551
But you're not ready
to face off with an ancient.
Ivy.

228
00:15:22.296 --> 00:15:23.967
What makes you say
that's an ancient?

229
00:15:24.034 --> 00:15:26.006
- David said...
- Let me guess.

230
00:15:26.073 --> 00:15:28.481
David said it was
highly unlikely.

231
00:15:28.547 --> 00:15:29.985
None have been seen in decades.

232
00:15:34.465 --> 00:15:35.736
Go home.

233
00:15:35.803 --> 00:15:38.879
Otherwise I'm gonna tell David
you were out hunting.

234
00:15:39.882 --> 00:15:40.383
You're a dick.

235
00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.426
- Where are you going?
- Get some beignets.

236
00:15:48.942 --> 00:15:51.048
- Hi.
- Hey.

237
00:15:55.127 --> 00:15:56.298
You look like crap.

238
00:15:56.364 --> 00:15:59.072
Thanks. I feel even better now.

239
00:15:59.139 --> 00:16:00.109
Seriously. are you feeling well?

240
00:16:01.379 --> 00:16:03.118
I think I might've had
a stomach bug yesterday.

241
00:16:03.184 --> 00:16:03.887
Do you need anything?

242
00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:07.498
I can make a mean bowl
of chicken noodle soup.

243
00:16:07.564 --> 00:16:08.935
Straight out of the can.

244
00:16:12.111 --> 00:16:12.446
- Hi!
- Jo Ann!

245
00:16:13.282 --> 00:16:15.187
You seriously need to
talk to him.

246
00:16:15.255 --> 00:16:18.564
I can't. You just saw that.
It happens every time I try to
talk to them.

247
00:16:18.631 --> 00:16:19.400
I sound like Beaker.

248
00:16:20.805 --> 00:16:23.077
Oh. my God. you totally did
just sound like Beaker.

249
00:16:26.555 --> 00:16:27.524
We'll be late for class.

250
00:16:34.746 --> 00:16:35.983
Hey. Jerome.

251
00:16:51.028 --> 00:16:51.296
Look. It's the crazy bitch.

252
00:16:52.131 --> 00:16:54.170
I'm surprised you're
walking today.

253
00:16:54.237 --> 00:16:58.049
I'm surprised they still allowed
in the Order
after you spotted that crazy
shit.

254
00:16:58.818 --> 00:17:00.222
Everything okay. Ivy?

255
00:17:03.833 --> 00:17:05.203
Everything is peachy.

256
00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:07.009
Doesn't seem like it.

257
00:17:16.771 --> 00:17:17.307
It's nothing.

258
00:17:18.544 --> 00:17:19.279
Sounds like it might be
more than nothing.

259
00:17:21.018 --> 00:17:23.359
Especially since Trent was just
talking about
what you said you saw.

260
00:17:24.428 --> 00:17:25.798
David and most of the Order
were listening.

261
00:17:27.537 --> 00:17:30.212
I don't think you should speak
so openly about what you saw.

262
00:17:30.647 --> 00:17:31.449
Thanks.

263
00:17:31.516 --> 00:17:32.452
But I didn't ask for
your opinion.

264
00:17:33.689 --> 00:17:34.525
You don't need to be at
this meeting. Ivy.

265
00:17:36.063 --> 00:17:39.239
I told you to keep your mouth
shut.
you did not do that.

266
00:17:39.306 --> 00:17:40.677
I only said something
because Trent...

267
00:17:40.743 --> 00:17:41.111
I didn't ask for an excuse.

268
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:44.789
You know he's full of shit half
of the time.
You should've left it at that.

269
00:17:44.856 --> 00:17:47.397
Seems like that issue
is with Trent and not Ivy.

270
00:17:47.464 --> 00:17:49.102
I didn't ask for your opinion.

271
00:17:49.169 --> 00:17:51.108
Half of the Order thinks
Ivy got a screw loose.

272
00:17:51.175 --> 00:17:52.813
The other half thinks we got
a fucking ancient running
around.

273
00:17:54.819 --> 00:17:58.296
Trent wouldn't have said shit
if Ivy hadn't bruised his balls
literally.

274
00:17:58.363 --> 00:17:59.800
He wanted to file a
complaint against you.

275
00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:02.108
You're damn lucky I
hate paperwork

276
00:18:02.174 --> 00:18:03.679
and already had to file one
on your ass this week.

277
00:18:03.746 --> 00:18:07.123
Because I got shot since maybe
we do have
an ancient on the streets.

278
00:18:08.494 --> 00:18:11.803
You. on the other hand.
do need to get your ass over
there.

279
00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.412
The other sect members
need to know you

280
00:18:14.478 --> 00:18:16.518
so they don't end up
accidently trying to kill you.

281
00:18:16.584 --> 00:18:18.490
I know I pulled you
off rotation.

282
00:18:18.557 --> 00:18:19.159
but I can't spare anyone else.

283
00:18:20.563 --> 00:18:22.836
So I'm gonna have to have you
show him around town.

284
00:18:22.904 --> 00:18:25.845
You won't be hunting.
If you do happen to cross a fae.

285
00:18:25.913 --> 00:18:29.457
he will handle it.
You don't have a say in this.
Ivy.

286
00:18:30.325 --> 00:18:31.696
You let that sink in
for a second

287
00:18:31.763 --> 00:18:33.802
before you continue
with whatever you're about to
say.

288
00:18:33.869 --> 00:18:34.805
- Got it.
- Good.

289
00:18:35.875 --> 00:18:36.811
Meet me back here
tomorrow at five.

290
00:18:37.748 --> 00:18:38.917
You no longer need him now.

291
00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:51.689
You were shot by an ancient?
Thought it was a thug.

292
00:18:53.294 --> 00:18:55.902
You need to call me girl.
bc every1 is saying cray cray
shit.

293
00:18:58.276 --> 00:19:01.886
DON'T FEED THE TROLLS!

294
00:19:13.555 --> 00:19:15.661
Stop leaving these things
around the house.

295
00:19:15.728 --> 00:19:16.999
It's weird.

296
00:19:17.066 --> 00:19:17.534
I did no such thing.

297
00:19:19.005 --> 00:19:22.081
I told you what they do.
They come alive when I'm
sleeping.

298
00:19:22.147 --> 00:19:23.317
It's not my fault.

299
00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:26.794
How was your day. honey?

300
00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:30.172
Not the greatest.

301
00:19:30.238 --> 00:19:32.211
You wanna tell Dr. Tink
all about it?

302
00:19:32.278 --> 00:19:34.350
I thought you didn't like
to be called Tink.

303
00:19:34.417 --> 00:19:36.290
Don't question my
inconsistencies.

304
00:19:36.356 --> 00:19:37.761
I don't wanna talk about it.

305
00:19:38.129 --> 00:19:39.098
But...

306
00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:42.107
I have pralines.

307
00:19:52.271 --> 00:19:53.407
You do this a lot?

308
00:19:53.474 --> 00:19:55.447
This "stare at me and not speak"
kind of thing?

309
00:19:58.857 --> 00:19:59.827
Oh.

310
00:20:03.739 --> 00:20:05.645
If you don't let me go. I
swear to God...

311
00:20:05.711 --> 00:20:08.486
I didn't come here to fight you.
I need to talk to you.

312
00:20:08.552 --> 00:20:10.492
You could've tried it.
I don't know... calling me.

313
00:20:10.558 --> 00:20:12.732
I did. You didn't answer.

314
00:20:16.343 --> 00:20:17.313
How'd you get in here?

315
00:20:17.379 --> 00:20:18.449
Your windows were unlocked.

316
00:20:18.516 --> 00:20:21.124
which I discovered
after scaling the vines.

317
00:20:21.191 --> 00:20:23.999
You broke into my place
and watched me sleep?

318
00:20:24.066 --> 00:20:25.738
That's got creep factor
written all over you.

319
00:20:30.218 --> 00:20:32.056
Are you... talking to someone?

320
00:20:36.068 --> 00:20:37.339
You really are Merida.

321
00:20:37.406 --> 00:20:39.412
Who in hell is this Merida?

322
00:20:39.479 --> 00:20:41.083
The chick from the movie Brave.

323
00:20:41.151 --> 00:20:42.756
Frizzy red hair. Got it.

324
00:20:42.822 --> 00:20:44.127
I'm seriously gonna stab you.

325
00:20:44.193 --> 00:20:45.831
She could kick ass. She was hot.

326
00:20:45.898 --> 00:20:47.536
This conversation is
taking a weird turn.

327
00:20:47.603 --> 00:20:50.145
And if you slide an inch or so
down.
things are gonna get real
awkward.

328
00:20:52.284 --> 00:20:53.722
Why do you need to talk to me?

329
00:20:55.593 --> 00:20:56.062
I know you're pissed.

330
00:20:57.232 --> 00:20:57.934
You made me look like a
fool to David.

331
00:20:59.539 --> 00:21:02.046
I told you David wouldn't think
that there was an ancient here.

332
00:21:02.113 --> 00:21:04.187
I know you don't have a reason
to trust me. Ivy. but...

333
00:21:05.089 --> 00:21:06.593
you should.

334
00:21:12.277 --> 00:21:13.247
See something you like?

335
00:21:14.417 --> 00:21:16.323
I bet your boyfriend is
one happy man.

336
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:17.794
My boyfriend's dead.

337
00:21:19.064 --> 00:21:20.000
I'm sorry.

338
00:21:20.669 --> 00:21:22.073
Was he part of the Order?

339
00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:24.146
But I doubt that's relevant
to why you're here.

340
00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:29.295
I'm here because I know
there are ancients in New
Orleans.

341
00:21:29.362 --> 00:21:30.365
I'm hunting them.

342
00:21:32.136 --> 00:21:35.714
I'm part of a secret
organization
within the Order that hunts
them.

343
00:21:35.781 --> 00:21:37.653
David doesn't even
know about us.

344
00:21:38.656 --> 00:21:41.231
Look. I'm starving.

345
00:21:41.298 --> 00:21:44.207
Can you grab something to eat
with me?
I'll explain everything.

346
00:21:44.273 --> 00:21:46.848
and you can tell me exactly
what happened the other night.

347
00:21:57.914 --> 00:21:59.786
Do you want some extra coffee
with your sugar?

348
00:22:01.591 --> 00:22:02.862
I like things sweet.

349
00:22:17.138 --> 00:22:20.415
Well. secret organization
within the Order.

350
00:22:24.928 --> 00:22:27.837
The only reason I'm telling you
is because. well.

351
00:22:27.904 --> 00:22:30.177
we're sorta stuck together
the next couple of days.

352
00:22:30.244 --> 00:22:32.919
and I can't afford to waste time
by keeping you in the dark.

353
00:22:34.155 --> 00:22:36.329
Gee. thanks.

354
00:22:36.998 --> 00:22:39.405
I belong to the Elite.

355
00:22:39.472 --> 00:22:40.207
Never heard of it.

356
00:22:41.478 --> 00:22:42.314
It's existed since the beginning
of the Order.

357
00:22:43.684 --> 00:22:45.858
Just like the Order.
the members are generational.

358
00:22:45.925 --> 00:22:47.629
runs in the family.

359
00:22:47.696 --> 00:22:51.073
We hunt fae like everyone else.
but we're trained to handle the
ancients.

360
00:22:52.009 --> 00:22:54.249
Did you manage to stab
that ancient?

361
00:22:54.317 --> 00:22:55.353
I did.

362
00:22:56.356 --> 00:22:57.426
But it didn't do
anything to him.

363
00:22:57.492 --> 00:22:59.432
It just pulled the stake out
and tossed it aside.

364
00:23:01.036 --> 00:23:04.347
If people in the Order. people
like you.
know about the ancients.

365
00:23:04.413 --> 00:23:05.516
why isn't it common knowledge?

366
00:23:06.386 --> 00:23:07.890
Not knowing is dangerous.

367
00:23:09.495 --> 00:23:10.765
The ancients are rare.

368
00:23:11.668 --> 00:23:13.807
They don't usually
engage the Order.

369
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:15.914
But how do you kill them?

370
00:23:22.869 --> 00:23:24.039
Thank you.

371
00:23:28.852 --> 00:23:30.591
There's only on thing that
will kill them.

372
00:23:31.962 --> 00:23:33.935
A stake fashioned from a
thorn birch tree

373
00:23:34.002 --> 00:23:35.305
that grows in the Otherworld.

374
00:23:36.509 --> 00:23:38.950
Yeah. so you can imagine
getting that shit isn't easy.

375
00:23:40.621 --> 00:23:42.326
I have one.

376
00:23:43.062 --> 00:23:44.366
That ancient conjured a gun.

377
00:23:44.433 --> 00:23:47.274
As long as they touch something.
they can conjure.

378
00:23:48.479 --> 00:23:48.879
They are powerful. Ivy.

379
00:23:50.485 --> 00:23:53.226
You're damn lucky you got away
from them
with just a flesh wound.

380
00:23:54.897 --> 00:23:57.506
The fact this one was out on the
street
and hunted you down means
something.

381
00:23:58.776 --> 00:24:01.383
We've lost three skilled
Order members since May.

382
00:24:04.894 --> 00:24:06.666
We've been tracking
movement of the fae.

383
00:24:06.733 --> 00:24:08.605
at least a hundred have
ended up here.

384
00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.463
There's a gateway to the
Otherworld
in New Orleans.

385
00:24:17.466 --> 00:24:17.933
How do you know that?

386
00:24:18.902 --> 00:24:20.273
The Elite knows cities
the gates are in.

387
00:24:21.778 --> 00:24:24.219
but we don't know the exact
location
or who guards them.

388
00:24:25.222 --> 00:24:27.061
You don't happen to guard
a gate. do you?

389
00:24:28.532 --> 00:24:31.039
'Cause that would make
my job so much easier.

390
00:24:38.161 --> 00:24:40.200
Do you ever wonder what it would
be like
to be one of them?

391
00:24:40.668 --> 00:24:41.638
No.

392
00:24:43.009 --> 00:24:44.179
They're lucky.

393
00:24:46.018 --> 00:24:47.254
We never had a chance.

394
00:24:47.321 --> 00:24:49.127
We were born into this.

395
00:24:53.005 --> 00:24:54.543
You know what's coming up.
right?

396
00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:55.646
The fall equinox.

397
00:24:56.783 --> 00:24:59.224
The gates are always weaker
during the equinox.

398
00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:00.561
The fae. the ancients
coming here.

399
00:25:00.628 --> 00:25:02.433
they could be gearing up
for something to do with it.

400
00:25:03.202 --> 00:25:04.172
Do you believe me now?

401
00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:07.047
I might believe you.

402
00:25:07.114 --> 00:25:09.087
but that doesn't mean
you can steal my bacon.

403
00:25:11.861 --> 00:25:13.299
I wanna show you something.

404
00:25:16.876 --> 00:25:18.347
What are you trying to show me?

405
00:25:20.253 --> 00:25:21.558
If you don't let me go.
so help me God...

406
00:25:21.624 --> 00:25:24.299
You're so full of threats.

407
00:25:24.365 --> 00:25:25.536
Look...

408
00:25:25.603 --> 00:25:26.573
Watch that car.

409
00:25:30.317 --> 00:25:32.624
That better Theo James
or Jensen Ackles getting out.

410
00:25:54.489 --> 00:25:56.495
- Don't.
- We have to do something. Ren.

411
00:25:58.066 --> 00:26:00.775
I know how hard it is to stand
here
and let that happen.

412
00:26:02.981 --> 00:26:05.522
He'll put you down and glamour
everyone
into thinking someone else
killed you.

413
00:26:05.588 --> 00:26:08.999
- Who's this guy?
- I cannot stress enough

414
00:26:09.066 --> 00:26:12.610
how dangerous ancients are
and you're not ready to fight
one.

415
00:26:13.512 --> 00:26:15.218
How did you know he
would be here?

416
00:26:17.056 --> 00:26:17.491
I've been in town for
about a week.

417
00:26:19.665 --> 00:26:23.209
And before that suspicious look
on your face
grows into a "lets-stab Ren"
look.

418
00:26:23.275 --> 00:26:27.321
I checked in with David the
moment
my fine ass stepped foot in this
city.

419
00:26:28.457 --> 00:26:30.630
I found that bastard last night.
did some research.

420
00:26:32.001 --> 00:26:35.445
He's registered in this hotel
as a Marlon St. Cyres.

421
00:26:36.148 --> 00:26:36.649
Wait... that name.

422
00:26:37.919 --> 00:26:39.792
He's some kind of
huge developer in the city.

423
00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:41.931
Yeah. he is.

424
00:26:41.998 --> 00:26:43.302
Holy shit.

425
00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:49.320
The fae masquerade as humans all
the time.
but never in such a public
position?

426
00:26:49.387 --> 00:26:52.764
They fae don't age so existing
in the public eye is risky for
them.

427
00:26:53.299 --> 00:26:54.469
What the hell?

428
00:26:55.238 --> 00:26:56.608
You look like you could use one.

429
00:26:56.676 --> 00:26:58.314
I look like I could use
a kiss on the cheek?

430
00:26:59.785 --> 00:27:00.721
You are bizarre.

431
00:27:01.891 --> 00:27:03.295
I think you kinda like
my bizarreness.

432
00:27:12.054 --> 00:27:13.225
You know I kill fae
for a living.

433
00:27:13.994 --> 00:27:15.331
You didn't have to walk me home.

434
00:27:15.933 --> 00:27:17.271
Call me chivalrous.

435
00:28:37.912 --> 00:28:40.353
I was wondering
if you were gonna show up.

436
00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:41.823
Not sure what I'm
supposed to do with you

437
00:28:41.891 --> 00:28:43.227
since you already know
your way around the city.

438
00:28:43.294 --> 00:28:45.768
I'm sure there are places
you can show me.

439
00:28:51.753 --> 00:28:53.525
You don't get out much. do you?

440
00:29:03.287 --> 00:29:04.792
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

441
00:29:28.464 --> 00:29:29.500
What in the hell?

442
00:29:29.567 --> 00:29:31.105
She took a bite out of that guy.

443
00:29:32.576 --> 00:29:35.685
She was fae food.
that's why she went nuts.

444
00:29:35.752 --> 00:29:37.591
She'll be dead by midnight.

445
00:29:47.219 --> 00:29:48.189
You got this?

446
00:29:50.061 --> 00:29:52.334
Hey. don't forget. we
need to talk.

447
00:29:53.004 --> 00:29:53.973
Yeah.

448
00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:12.094
It doesn't get any easier...

449
00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:23.294
Oh. my God.
I almost got taken out by a
moped.

450
00:30:24.965 --> 00:30:27.674
Good thing you have me around
saving you from crazy moped
drivers.

451
00:30:30.716 --> 00:30:32.388
- Ivy?
- Yeah?

452
00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:36.801
I mean. you don't have to.
but if you keep tugging it like
that.

453
00:30:36.868 --> 00:30:38.206
I'm gonna get all
kinds of ideas.

454
00:30:43.956 --> 00:30:46.898
We should probably clear the
area.
there'll be cops.

455
00:30:48.871 --> 00:30:50.041
Do you have a girlfriend?

456
00:30:59.904 --> 00:31:02.077
Hey! You're back.
and you didn't get shot.

457
00:31:02.144 --> 00:31:03.916
- You weren't shot again. right?
- Nope.

458
00:31:03.982 --> 00:31:05.821
You know what I've
been thinking?

459
00:31:05.888 --> 00:31:09.031
That guy that was in here last
night?
I think you wanna get it on with
him.

460
00:31:09.332 --> 00:31:10.736
What?

461
00:31:10.803 --> 00:31:12.006
You left the house with him
after he obviously broke in.

462
00:31:13.679 --> 00:31:17.523
I'm telling you what. you
females are freaks.
Females of my kind?

463
00:31:17.591 --> 00:31:21.301
If you broke in. they'd eat you
for dinner.
And not in the fun way.

464
00:31:21.368 --> 00:31:23.742
Firstly. I don't think breaking
into someone's apartment

465
00:31:23.809 --> 00:31:27.018
is something to swoon about.
And secondly. Ren didn't break
in

466
00:31:27.086 --> 00:31:29.425
because someone left
the window unlocked.

467
00:31:29.492 --> 00:31:30.863
I did no such thing.

468
00:31:32.066 --> 00:31:34.474
Okay. I might've done that.
but he climbed a a wall

469
00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:38.152
and that's kind of...
Actually. that's kind of
impressive.

470
00:31:38.219 --> 00:31:40.325
I bet that means
he could pick you up and...

471
00:31:40.392 --> 00:31:43.200
Oh .my God. Tink. really?

472
00:31:43.267 --> 00:31:46.109
He's a member of the Order
and I'm not talking about sex
with you.

473
00:31:46.611 --> 00:31:48.182
Sex is good.

474
00:31:48.249 --> 00:31:49.252
Shut up. Tink.

475
00:31:49.319 --> 00:31:50.155
Sex is fun.

476
00:31:50.221 --> 00:31:52.127
Sex is best when
it's one on one!

477
00:31:53.665 --> 00:31:55.069
Isn't that a George
Michael song?

478
00:31:55.136 --> 00:31:57.844
Maybe. But he was wrong.
I like to think sex is best

479
00:31:57.911 --> 00:32:00.853
when it's three on three or
something.
Seems more adventurous.

480
00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.090
Good night. Tink!

481
00:32:16.868 --> 00:32:18.038
Hey!

482
00:32:19.575 --> 00:32:23.922
Hey! You got me worried. Ivy.
People are talking...

483
00:32:23.989 --> 00:32:25.527
And they're saying I'm crazy.

484
00:32:26.663 --> 00:32:29.172
Trent said you told David
that it was an ancient?

485
00:32:29.238 --> 00:32:30.442
And he's not the only one.

486
00:32:34.052 --> 00:32:36.125
I saw another ancient
in the Warehouse District.

487
00:32:36.193 --> 00:32:38.064
Marlon St. Cyers.
a huge developer.

488
00:32:39.067 --> 00:32:41.006
Fae don't make themselves
public like that.

489
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:43.581
Okay. so. I mean.
why do you think they're here?

490
00:32:44.985 --> 00:32:47.292
I think they may be planning
something with the gates.

491
00:32:48.027 --> 00:32:50.000
I don't know what. but I...

492
00:32:51.371 --> 00:32:52.039
What?

493
00:32:53.277 --> 00:32:55.951
What I'm about to tell you
can't go any further. okay?

494
00:32:56.018 --> 00:32:58.158
Honey. I am a vault of secrets.

495
00:33:00.766 --> 00:33:03.674
Ren knows about the ancients.
He's part of the Elite.

496
00:33:04.745 --> 00:33:06.984
What in the fuckity fuck
is the Elite?

497
00:33:07.051 --> 00:33:09.090
A secret branch in the Order
that fights the ancients.

498
00:33:10.027 --> 00:33:11.498
That's why he's here
in New Orleans.

499
00:33:12.802 --> 00:33:14.273
Okay. so what's the plan?

500
00:33:15.343 --> 00:33:17.114
I was thinking about
seeing Merle today.

501
00:33:17.181 --> 00:33:18.652
If anyone knows about the gates.
it's her.

502
00:33:21.026 --> 00:33:25.005
The last time you visited Merle
with me.
she called you a harlot and the
slut of Satan.

503
00:33:25.573 --> 00:33:27.546
The slut of Satan?

504
00:33:29.117 --> 00:33:30.388
That's actually an
impressive title.

505
00:33:31.525 --> 00:33:34.199
All right. fine. so is Renny boy
going with you?

506
00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:37.376
No. I haven't told him
about her yet.

507
00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:41.521
My momma always used to talk
about the ancients all the time.

508
00:33:41.588 --> 00:33:44.497
She said that they ran the
courts
in the Otherworld.

509
00:33:44.564 --> 00:33:48.241
She said there was a prince.
a princess. a king and queen.

510
00:33:48.309 --> 00:33:50.381
and that they
controlled the knights.

511
00:33:50.448 --> 00:33:54.527
What if the ancients here
wanna open the gates for them?

512
00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:58.238
That would be very bad.

513
00:33:59.508 --> 00:34:00.478
Yeah.

514
00:34:38.358 --> 00:34:39.896
Hi. you've reached Brighton.
leave a message.

515
00:34:39.963 --> 00:34:44.342
Hey Brighton. it's Ivy. I'm here
at your
place looking for your mom.

516
00:34:44.410 --> 00:34:46.716
Give me a call back
when you get this. Thanks.

517
00:35:00.758 --> 00:35:02.329
- For you.
- Why?

518
00:35:02.396 --> 00:35:04.002
I saw this on my way here
and thought of you.

519
00:35:06.776 --> 00:35:09.418
This is the part where you take
the rose from me.

520
00:35:11.156 --> 00:35:12.561
Thanks.

521
00:35:15.368 --> 00:35:16.539
What did you do today?

522
00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:19.882
It's just a simple question.

523
00:35:21.053 --> 00:35:23.059
I bought beignets
and staked out the hotel

524
00:35:23.126 --> 00:35:24.395
we'd seen the ancient go into.

525
00:35:27.138 --> 00:35:28.943
What do you carry around
in that bag pack?

526
00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:30.815
Textbooks. Notebooks.

527
00:35:30.882 --> 00:35:31.952
Textbooks?

528
00:35:33.222 --> 00:35:34.527
I'm going to college.
Majoring in Sociology.

529
00:35:36.031 --> 00:35:38.705
You do that and this?
Do you plan on leaving the
Order?

530
00:35:40.343 --> 00:35:42.349
I'm pretty sure the only way
you leave the Order is in a body
bag.

531
00:35:43.386 --> 00:35:44.924
People have left the Order. Ivy.

532
00:35:46.161 --> 00:35:47.766
I don't wanna leave.
I just wanna do more.

533
00:35:48.502 --> 00:35:49.905
I wanna be a social worker.

534
00:35:51.744 --> 00:35:53.884
I don't think I've ever met
anyone like you.

535
00:35:53.951 --> 00:35:55.055
Ivy!

536
00:35:56.124 --> 00:35:57.596
Is that how you talk to a lady?

537
00:35:57.662 --> 00:35:59.167
Who in the hell do you
think you are?

538
00:35:59.234 --> 00:36:01.608
It's okay. He's a
jerk to everyone.

539
00:36:02.109 --> 00:36:03.112
Not everyone.

540
00:36:03.179 --> 00:36:03.614
Your dog doesn't count.

541
00:36:04.984 --> 00:36:07.592
You owe me. This is the first
time
you've forgotten.

542
00:36:09.197 --> 00:36:10.333
Forgot what?

543
00:36:10.701 --> 00:36:11.604
Cake.

544
00:36:11.671 --> 00:36:13.075
The best damn chocolate cake
I've ever had.

545
00:36:14.245 --> 00:36:15.950
That girl brings it to me
every Monday.

546
00:36:16.018 --> 00:36:18.525
I'm sorry.
I'll bring it to you tomorrow.
Okay?

547
00:36:19.027 --> 00:36:19.995
You'd better.

548
00:36:25.145 --> 00:36:26.916
And why haven't I
been offered any?

549
00:36:26.983 --> 00:36:29.390
You're gonna have to get to know
me better
before you taste my cake.

550
00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:31.864
Was that an invitation?

551
00:36:31.931 --> 00:36:33.737
That's not what I meant!

552
00:36:36.311 --> 00:36:37.549
We got work to do. come on.

553
00:36:51.624 --> 00:36:53.061
You expect me to get on that?

554
00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:54.900
That is a Ducati.

555
00:37:00.618 --> 00:37:04.529
Look. I got a job to do
that doesn't include tracking
normal fae.

556
00:37:08.441 --> 00:37:09.778
I don't think I like you.

557
00:37:11.216 --> 00:37:12.419
I bet your taste is as sweet

558
00:37:12.486 --> 00:37:14.693
as one of those beignets
you've got me addicted to.

559
00:37:15.763 --> 00:37:18.939
But you got one hell of a kick.
You like me.

560
00:37:19.006 --> 00:37:20.978
You're just not ready
to admit it yet.

561
00:37:28.267 --> 00:37:29.237
You're coming or not?

562
00:37:34.653 --> 00:37:36.191
You're gonna have to hold on.
sweetness.

563
00:37:56.083 --> 00:37:58.089
I've been keeping an eye
on our friend.

564
00:37:58.156 --> 00:38:00.330
At night he leaves the hotel
and goes to this club.

565
00:38:04.442 --> 00:38:05.512
Ever been in there?

566
00:38:05.578 --> 00:38:05.846
I don't go to a lot of clubs.

567
00:38:07.584 --> 00:38:11.764
I did the partying thing before
I turned 21.
drove my parents crazy.

568
00:38:12.433 --> 00:38:13.602
Your parents still alive?

569
00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:14.907
Yeah. Yours?

570
00:38:15.943 --> 00:38:17.581
My real parents died
when I was just a baby

571
00:38:17.648 --> 00:38:22.629
and my adopted parents...
they're gone. too.

572
00:38:24.803 --> 00:38:27.277
That's him. The fae who shot me.

573
00:38:33.529 --> 00:38:35.235
You think that alley runs
behind the club?

574
00:38:36.003 --> 00:38:37.307
Only one way to find out...

575
00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:53.757
Stay back.
You're not supposed to hunt.

576
00:38:55.461 --> 00:38:56.431
Hey.

577
00:38:58.236 --> 00:39:00.410
The Order.
Must be getting desperate.

578
00:39:06.227 --> 00:39:08.199
Take him out.
we don't have time for this.

579
00:39:21.506 --> 00:39:22.676
Really?

580
00:39:42.904 --> 00:39:45.110
Well... that was fun.

581
00:39:45.177 --> 00:39:46.849
I thought I told you
to stay back!

582
00:39:46.916 --> 00:39:49.322
I wanted to keep at least one of
them alive
to. you know. question it.

583
00:39:50.493 --> 00:39:52.532
I saw that. You flinched.
Let me see. Ivy.

584
00:39:52.599 --> 00:39:54.538
I'm fine. Jesus.

585
00:39:54.605 --> 00:39:57.246
How would you like it if I ran
around
pulling your shirt up?

586
00:39:57.313 --> 00:39:58.350
I'd fucking love it.

587
00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:08.279
Oh. no.

588
00:40:13.127 --> 00:40:14.966
- Do you see Val?
- No.

589
00:40:18.242 --> 00:40:19.212
Hey.

590
00:40:24.495 --> 00:40:25.364
We lost Trent tonight.

591
00:40:26.468 --> 00:40:29.810
He was found just outside
of St. Louis Cemetery.

592
00:40:29.877 --> 00:40:33.455
His neck... was broken.

593
00:40:34.625 --> 00:40:35.762
Amongst other things.

594
00:40:35.828 --> 00:40:36.397
He was tortured.

595
00:40:37.567 --> 00:40:39.005
He's the fourth to die
in five months.

596
00:40:39.673 --> 00:40:40.476
Were the others tortured?

597
00:40:40.743 --> 00:40:42.449
No.

598
00:40:42.516 --> 00:40:48.166
From now until further notice.
you all will be working in
groups of two.

599
00:40:49.537 --> 00:40:50.506
No one hunts alone.

600
00:40:52.011 --> 00:40:53.682
Stay safe out there.

601
00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:56.290
Ivy.

602
00:41:01.305 --> 00:41:02.642
Where were you tonight?

603
00:41:02.709 --> 00:41:04.682
- I was out with Ren.
- Where?

604
00:41:04.748 --> 00:41:06.186
We started out by Jackson Square

605
00:41:06.253 --> 00:41:07.457
and then headed down
to the Business District.

606
00:41:08.292 --> 00:41:10.065
We ran into three fae.

607
00:41:10.132 --> 00:41:13.307
So you weren't in the Quarter
tonight
except for the beginning of your
shift?

608
00:41:13.374 --> 00:41:16.484
No. Why are you asking me this?

609
00:41:16.551 --> 00:41:17.621
Just checking.

610
00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:19.560
That's all.

611
00:41:26.881 --> 00:41:28.219
I gotta go too.

612
00:41:31.428 --> 00:41:32.732
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Okay.

613
00:41:37.614 --> 00:41:38.416
You and Val are close?

614
00:41:39.854 --> 00:41:41.491
She's the first person I made
when I moved down here.

615
00:41:43.064 --> 00:41:45.805
Every one of those members
killed
could've been guards of the
gate.

616
00:41:46.774 --> 00:41:48.647
They were all highly skilled.

617
00:41:48.714 --> 00:41:51.956
If the fae knew to target them
then that means someone within
the Order

618
00:41:52.024 --> 00:41:53.194
could be assisting the fae.

619
00:41:56.103 --> 00:41:59.078
How is your stomach?
No bullshit.

620
00:42:00.348 --> 00:42:02.388
It's a little tender.
but it's not a big deal.

621
00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:05.698
How are you... up here?

622
00:42:08.506 --> 00:42:10.947
Trent wasn't always easy
to get along with.

623
00:42:11.013 --> 00:42:12.251
but I'd never wish him dead.

624
00:42:13.822 --> 00:42:16.330
You think David knows
more than what he's putting out
there?

625
00:42:17.132 --> 00:42:18.469
Everything has to be connected.

626
00:42:18.536 --> 00:42:21.511
The fae migrating here.
club FLUX.

627
00:42:21.579 --> 00:42:23.785
Something's going down.
We need to get in there.

628
00:42:29.903 --> 00:42:32.544
Hi. Ivy. It's Brighton.
I got your message.

629
00:42:32.612 --> 00:42:33.381
I can't believe
what happened to Trent.

630
00:42:34.785 --> 00:42:36.924
We're in Texas now.
but we'll be home tomorrow.

631
00:42:36.991 --> 00:42:38.329
And please be careful!

632
00:42:42.441 --> 00:42:43.511
You look like you're going out
trolling for sex.

633
00:42:45.216 --> 00:42:48.426
Like the dirty. nasty kind that
ends up
with a wide array of STDs.

634
00:42:49.061 --> 00:42:49.830
Thanks for the input.

635
00:42:50.766 --> 00:42:51.168
Are you sure this is smart?

636
00:42:52.772 --> 00:42:54.510
If there are ancients there.
Ivy.
you shouldn't be near them.

637
00:42:56.985 --> 00:42:58.957
It's the best chance we have
of finding out what they're up
to.

638
00:43:00.629 --> 00:43:02.134
Ren's here and he can't see you.

639
00:43:02.201 --> 00:43:02.736
I'm not afraid of him.

640
00:43:03.872 --> 00:43:05.176
I didn't say you were
afraid of him.

641
00:43:06.613 --> 00:43:07.717
Behave.

642
00:43:08.252 --> 00:43:09.555
Don't I always?

643
00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:20.588
This is wrong.

644
00:43:21.893 --> 00:43:24.968
It's the only dress I could
wear.
Val made me get it.

645
00:43:25.035 --> 00:43:26.540
I've never worn it before.

646
00:43:26.606 --> 00:43:27.543
Oh. sweetness.

647
00:43:29.282 --> 00:43:30.986
You did wrong in all
the right ways.

648
00:43:32.156 --> 00:43:33.862
How in the world
am I gonna pay attention

649
00:43:33.929 --> 00:43:34.898
when you look like that?

650
00:43:38.275 --> 00:43:39.780
You are absolutely beautiful.
Ivy.

651
00:43:43.959 --> 00:43:45.028
What was that?

652
00:43:45.095 --> 00:43:45.630
I... I have a cat.

653
00:43:46.768 --> 00:43:48.138
It probably knocked
something over.

654
00:43:48.205 --> 00:43:49.777
It's old. and annoying.
Gonna die soon.

655
00:43:49.843 --> 00:43:50.946
We should get going.

656
00:44:05.323 --> 00:44:06.493
You are carrying. right?

657
00:44:08.466 --> 00:44:10.305
Damn. That's what
fantasies are made of.

658
00:44:12.210 --> 00:44:13.380
You ready?

659
00:44:14.149 --> 00:44:15.320
Are you?

660
00:44:48.552 --> 00:44:49.890
You're seeing what I'm seeing?

661
00:44:51.561 --> 00:44:53.767
I've never seen so many humans
and fae together.

662
00:44:57.245 --> 00:44:58.415
Shit!

663
00:45:04.266 --> 00:45:05.370
What are you doing?

664
00:45:07.174 --> 00:45:08.612
He's by the dance floor.

665
00:45:10.385 --> 00:45:12.791
What do we do now
since this was your genius idea?

666
00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:14.195
We just blend in.

667
00:45:14.262 --> 00:45:15.667
Blending in means having sex.

668
00:45:15.733 --> 00:45:18.274
or haven't you noticed
that's what's happening around
us?

669
00:45:18.342 --> 00:45:21.050
Oh. I've noticed. Dance. Ivy.

670
00:45:27.569 --> 00:45:29.977
You're doing good.
but I know you can do better.

671
00:45:31.581 --> 00:45:32.952
Try to keep an eye on
the ancient.

672
00:46:25.443 --> 00:46:29.287
Careful. I know damn well
he hasn't forgotten that face of
yours.

673
00:46:59.512 --> 00:47:04.894
Tell me yes... and I'll do
anything...
anything you want.

674
00:47:09.675 --> 00:47:11.714
Marlon is here.
We need to get up there.

675
00:47:12.316 --> 00:47:14.055
It's too dangerous.

676
00:47:14.122 --> 00:47:16.763
If he suspects you're with the
Order.
I won't be able to get to you in
time.

677
00:47:17.532 --> 00:47:19.270
I don't need your permission.

678
00:47:20.373 --> 00:47:21.410
Oh. I know what you need.

679
00:47:27.863 --> 00:47:30.370
That's good.
How many will that make. Roman?

680
00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:33.011
Five. once it's carried out...

681
00:47:33.079 --> 00:47:36.221
We don't have much more time.
We cannot let him down.

682
00:47:36.288 --> 00:47:40.601
We know the location.
the bastard broke.

683
00:47:40.668 --> 00:47:42.273
We will not fail this time.

684
00:47:51.166 --> 00:47:53.205
Little one. you look a bit lost.

685
00:47:54.342 --> 00:47:56.013
I was just looking for
the restroom.

686
00:47:56.616 --> 00:47:57.719
Do you know where it is?

687
00:47:57.786 --> 00:48:01.396
This is not the restroom.
What is your name?

688
00:48:02.166 --> 00:48:02.433
Anna.

689
00:48:03.904 --> 00:48:08.484
A silly little name.
Perfect for a silly little
human.

690
00:48:22.727 --> 00:48:25.435
You pulled the fire alarm?
I totally had it under control.

691
00:48:25.502 --> 00:48:28.110
Sure you did. It looked like
you were about to be his pop
tart.

692
00:48:28.177 --> 00:48:29.547
I think they know
where the gate is.

693
00:48:30.685 --> 00:48:32.556
If they do and we don't.
we are fucked.

694
00:48:32.624 --> 00:48:33.727
Can't we go to David?

695
00:48:33.794 --> 00:48:35.030
What if David is the one
working with them?

696
00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:37.438
Are you serious? It could be me.

697
00:48:37.504 --> 00:48:40.781
They shot you. I don't think
they'd shoot
the person helping them.

698
00:48:40.848 --> 00:48:42.519
I don't trust
any other member of the Order.

699
00:48:42.586 --> 00:48:43.589
except maybe Jerome.

700
00:48:43.657 --> 00:48:44.827
Jerome has been
deemed trustworthy?

701
00:48:44.893 --> 00:48:47.267
He's too damn mean
to be influenced by the fae.

702
00:48:47.334 --> 00:48:49.072
I guess tonight wasn't
a total bust.

703
00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:52.349
You're right. it wasn't.
Because I'm awesome.

704
00:48:52.416 --> 00:48:55.625
Like I put the awe
with the some. Admit it.

705
00:48:56.696 --> 00:48:57.665
You know what I'll admit?

706
00:48:57.732 --> 00:48:59.035
Waiting.

707
00:48:59.102 --> 00:49:01.410
I'll admit you felt sweet as
silk
against my fingers

708
00:49:01.476 --> 00:49:02.947
when I had my hand
between those thighs...

709
00:49:03.014 --> 00:49:06.090
I was acting. you arrogant.
self-important. mother...

710
00:49:06.157 --> 00:49:10.069
Bullshit! You're acting
like nothing happened between
us.

711
00:49:10.135 --> 00:49:12.409
You lit up for me
like a goddamn firework.

712
00:49:13.379 --> 00:49:17.090
What is the deal?
Do you still love him?

713
00:49:17.759 --> 00:49:18.895
Your ex?

714
00:49:19.832 --> 00:49:23.409
A part of me... always will.
but no.

715
00:49:26.786 --> 00:49:27.454
I don't get it then.

716
00:49:28.657 --> 00:49:32.068
Why do you want me?
You barely know me.

717
00:49:33.439 --> 00:49:37.986
What I know is that
if you want something. you go
for it.

718
00:49:38.052 --> 00:49:41.162
I wanna know your story.
I wanna know you.

719
00:49:41.229 --> 00:49:43.636
I want... oh. fuck it!

720
00:50:17.103 --> 00:50:18.374
Let's not rush forward.

721
00:50:20.045 --> 00:50:22.653
But don't let us take three
steps
back from this. okay?

722
00:50:36.561 --> 00:50:39.337
- Can't make our coffee morning
date. sorry.
- Okay.

723
00:50:42.512 --> 00:50:45.053
- Ivy. let's get together.
- Can you meet me for coffee?

724
00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:46.290
So?

725
00:50:48.129 --> 00:50:49.600
I met a guy.

726
00:50:49.667 --> 00:50:50.904
You did?

727
00:50:50.971 --> 00:50:52.542
- He works with me.
- Is he cute?

728
00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:57.925
I don't think cute is
a strong enough word to describe
him.

729
00:50:57.992 --> 00:50:59.630
So he's hot. And you like him.

730
00:51:01.068 --> 00:51:03.609
I have a mad case of insta-lust
when it comes to him.

731
00:51:03.676 --> 00:51:06.384
but in a way.
we're kind of strangers.

732
00:51:07.821 --> 00:51:10.128
You know. people usually are
strangers
when they meet

733
00:51:10.195 --> 00:51:12.602
and then they get to know each
other
through. I don't know. dating.

734
00:51:14.174 --> 00:51:18.219
I don't know if he's interested
in dating or just hooking up.

735
00:51:18.286 --> 00:51:19.724
I don't even know
if I'm interested in dating.

736
00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:22.632
Then what's the problem?
If you both want it. go for it.

737
00:51:26.678 --> 00:51:30.390
The last guy I dated.
the only guy I've been with...

738
00:51:32.596 --> 00:51:33.632
he died.

739
00:51:36.073 --> 00:51:37.243
What?

740
00:51:37.778 --> 00:51:38.747
He...

741
00:51:40.921 --> 00:51:44.565
He died with my adoptive parents
in a car accident.

742
00:51:44.632 --> 00:51:47.607
I get it. you're not entirely
ready to move on.

743
00:51:47.674 --> 00:51:52.388
I think I'm ready to move on.
but is that wrong?

744
00:51:52.456 --> 00:51:54.996
Am I somehow betraying him?

745
00:51:55.063 --> 00:51:56.835
Oh honey.
that is not betraying him.

746
00:51:56.901 --> 00:51:58.874
If he cared for you.
he wouldn't want you

747
00:51:58.942 --> 00:52:02.017
to never go out
with another guy or fall in love
again.

748
00:52:02.084 --> 00:52:06.698
Moving on is the right thing to
do...
but do you trust him?

749
00:52:08.069 --> 00:52:10.610
Yeah... I trust him.

750
00:52:12.883 --> 00:52:13.953
See ya in class.

751
00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:17.864
- And thank you for the coffee.
- You're welcome.

752
00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:32.408
- Ivy?
- That would be me.

753
00:52:33.411 --> 00:52:35.016
I'm just surprised
you're calling me.

754
00:52:35.852 --> 00:52:36.821
Are you busy?

755
00:52:57.951 --> 00:52:58.921
Get used to it.

756
00:53:01.161 --> 00:53:02.464
My friend Brighton lives here.

757
00:53:02.532 --> 00:53:04.037
Her mom Merle
used to work for the Order.

758
00:53:04.103 --> 00:53:07.346
She was pretty high up.
She might know where the gate
is.

759
00:53:08.617 --> 00:53:10.856
You've known that this woman
could tell us the location?

760
00:53:10.923 --> 00:53:12.996
Yes. But I didn't
exactly trust you.

761
00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:15.470
So you're saying you
trust me now?

762
00:53:20.886 --> 00:53:21.856
Merle was caught by
the fae once.

763
00:53:23.227 --> 00:53:25.635
They fed off of her.
she was never the same since.

764
00:53:27.106 --> 00:53:31.184
Sometimes doesn't act right.
She could be completely normal
or...

765
00:53:32.321 --> 00:53:33.859
Hey. Brighton!
Thanks for seeing me.

766
00:53:34.895 --> 00:53:37.336
This is Ren.
He's part of the Order.

767
00:53:37.403 --> 00:53:38.674
You're new.

768
00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:41.683
Yes ma'am. I'm from Colorado.
Just transferred here.

769
00:53:42.418 --> 00:53:43.421
You're a long way from home.

770
00:53:43.487 --> 00:53:44.625
That I am.

771
00:53:44.692 --> 00:53:45.962
May I ask what you'd like to see
my mom about?

772
00:53:47.499 --> 00:53:50.810
We've lost four Order members
in a short time. and we think...

773
00:53:50.876 --> 00:53:51.578
they may have been
guardians of the gate.

774
00:53:53.217 --> 00:53:55.055
We think the fae are trying
to open the gate here on the
equinox.

775
00:53:56.226 --> 00:53:57.831
What does David have
to say about this?

776
00:54:00.238 --> 00:54:01.141
We haven't told him yet.

777
00:54:02.311 --> 00:54:03.982
If the members killed
were guardians.

778
00:54:04.049 --> 00:54:06.289
then someone within the Order
has to be feeding names to the
fae.

779
00:54:07.761 --> 00:54:09.833
And you wanna talk to my mom
about the location of the gate?

780
00:54:11.204 --> 00:54:14.180
Even if there's a slim chance
she could tell us...

781
00:54:17.589 --> 00:54:18.760
She's in the garden.

782
00:54:23.942 --> 00:54:26.984
- Mama...
- I know. We have company.
sweetheart.

783
00:54:27.051 --> 00:54:30.228
I may have a few bats in the
belfry.
but I'm not deaf.

784
00:54:31.733 --> 00:54:36.279
Well. hello there.
It's been a while since I've
seen you.

785
00:54:36.346 --> 00:54:39.589
And you brought someone
other than that hussy with you.

786
00:54:40.258 --> 00:54:42.231
Val. Merle. this is Ren.

787
00:54:42.297 --> 00:54:45.173
I know who he is. Renald Owens.

788
00:54:46.744 --> 00:54:47.714
Your full name is Renald?

789
00:54:48.649 --> 00:54:51.926
Why do you think I go by Ren?
Ma'am...

790
00:54:51.993 --> 00:54:55.603
Ooh. call me Merle. sweetheart.

791
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:57.576
Mama. they're here to ask you
something important.

792
00:54:57.643 --> 00:55:01.923
I know they are.
Why don't you two take a seat?

793
00:55:01.989 --> 00:55:02.959
Cop a squat.

794
00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:05.835
I'll get us some tea.

795
00:55:13.524 --> 00:55:14.694
We're here...

796
00:55:14.761 --> 00:55:18.672
Like I said. darling.
I know why you're here.

797
00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:20.678
It has to do with the Elite.

798
00:55:20.746 --> 00:55:25.527
I know all about them.
If you're here...

799
00:55:25.593 --> 00:55:27.967
that means the ancients
are up to no good.

800
00:55:29.572 --> 00:55:30.073
You know about the ancients?

801
00:55:31.411 --> 00:55:34.085
I know that not all fae wish
for the same thing.

802
00:55:35.523 --> 00:55:39.201
Son. I also know
why you're really here.

803
00:55:40.471 --> 00:55:41.943
The Elite hunt the ancients.

804
00:55:43.112 --> 00:55:44.952
but that's not the only
duty you have.

805
00:55:48.061 --> 00:55:50.133
What do you wanna know. doll?

806
00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:51.271
They wanna know
where the gate is here.

807
00:55:52.541 --> 00:55:56.353
I used to be a guardian.
I know about everything.

808
00:55:58.124 --> 00:56:01.100
The wards used to seal
up the gates.

809
00:56:02.437 --> 00:56:04.175
the blood required to open them.

810
00:56:06.416 --> 00:56:07.452
the crystal that heals.

811
00:56:10.795 --> 00:56:12.334
Then I met my match.

812
00:56:14.707 --> 00:56:16.111
So they say.

813
00:56:17.716 --> 00:56:19.087
I really don't recall that day.

814
00:56:19.154 --> 00:56:20.458
Mama. do you know
where the gate is?

815
00:56:21.896 --> 00:56:27.813
My darling girl.
there isn't only one gate in our
city.

816
00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:29.250
There are two.

817
00:56:31.791 --> 00:56:36.005
Are you sure? I've never heard
of two doors being in one city.

818
00:56:37.576 --> 00:56:38.479
One is in the sanctuary.

819
00:56:40.117 --> 00:56:45.433
and the other is in a place
where the atmosphere is so
unsettled

820
00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:49.712
not even the humans
or the spirits can rest.

821
00:56:51.986 --> 00:56:54.125
Oh. it's pretty simple. girl.
I don't know how much clearer I
can be.

822
00:56:54.192 --> 00:56:57.134
But back to the more important
thing.
Have you found it yet?

823
00:56:58.237 --> 00:56:59.274
You're gonna need to find it.

824
00:57:00.745 --> 00:57:03.620
You know what will happen
if they come through that gate.

825
00:57:05.325 --> 00:57:06.830
I know.

826
00:57:06.897 --> 00:57:10.976
If the prince comes through.
or the princess. and they find
it.

827
00:57:11.043 --> 00:57:13.316
it'll all be undone. Renald.
Everything.

828
00:57:14.352 --> 00:57:15.355
Mama. what are you
talking about?

829
00:57:15.423 --> 00:57:18.297
I fear those gates
will break this time. Renald.

830
00:57:18.364 --> 00:57:19.635
It's in the wind.

831
00:57:19.702 --> 00:57:23.982
It's in the very song of the
birds.
It's in the soil.

832
00:57:24.683 --> 00:57:26.489
Everything will be undone.

833
00:57:27.426 --> 00:57:28.729
You must find the halfling.

834
00:57:28.796 --> 00:57:29.933
Halfling? Mama. what are you
talking about?

835
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:33.176
Because it's a threat to it all.
To everything.

836
00:57:33.644 --> 00:57:34.680
Everything!

837
00:57:34.747 --> 00:57:35.917
Mama!

838
00:57:37.254 --> 00:57:39.963
I'm sorry. but you
two need to go.

839
00:57:41.266 --> 00:57:42.269
Mama...

840
00:57:43.874 --> 00:57:45.613
A halfling? What...

841
00:57:46.315 --> 00:57:48.020
We should leave.

842
00:57:48.087 --> 00:57:50.327
I'm not going anywhere until you
tell me
what the hell is really going
on.

843
00:57:51.664 --> 00:57:53.704
I'll tell you everything.
I'm not gonna do it here.

844
00:57:57.014 --> 00:57:58.952
I like seeing you in my place.

845
00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:00.290
Start with the halflings.

846
00:58:03.634 --> 00:58:04.435
Good choice.

847
00:58:05.506 --> 00:58:07.178
A halfling is a child
of a human and a fae.

848
00:58:08.482 --> 00:58:11.423
There used to be thousands.
but now there's only a few left.

849
00:58:12.092 --> 00:58:13.029
Why are there so few now?

850
00:58:14.299 --> 00:58:17.141
Our job. the Elite's.
is not just to hunt down
ancients.

851
00:58:17.208 --> 00:58:20.685
We're also given the duty
of hunting down the halflings.

852
00:58:21.621 --> 00:58:23.025
As in killing them?

853
00:58:25.498 --> 00:58:28.274
When the gates of the Otherworld
were created with magic.

854
00:58:28.341 --> 00:58:32.754
they were done so with the
ability
to be closed and opened.

855
00:58:32.821 --> 00:58:36.599
However. there is a loophole.

856
00:58:36.666 --> 00:58:40.545
one act that could open all
doorways
and we would never be able to
close them.

857
00:58:42.349 --> 00:58:44.924
If the prince or princess
were to procreate with a
halfling.

858
00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:48.769
the child resulting from such a
union
would undo the original spells

859
00:58:48.835 --> 00:58:50.040
creating the doorways.

860
00:58:50.106 --> 00:58:51.276
Holy shit.

861
00:58:52.747 --> 00:58:53.516
It's like the apocalypse baby.

862
00:58:54.887 --> 00:58:57.194
We have evidence
there is a halfling in New
Orleans.

863
00:58:58.364 --> 00:59:01.073
The person probably
has no idea what they are.

864
00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:07.258
The fae can't even sniff out a
halfling.
unless they get near their
blood.

865
00:59:07.324 --> 00:59:08.427
How do you find them?

866
00:59:10.032 --> 00:59:12.106
Well. most of them are
in the Order.

867
00:59:13.276 --> 00:59:14.947
You mean an Order member
had sex with a fae

868
00:59:15.014 --> 00:59:16.351
knowing what they were?

869
00:59:16.418 --> 00:59:19.828
Another constant among halflings
is that they are adopted.

870
00:59:20.631 --> 00:59:21.566
I'm adopted.

871
00:59:22.737 --> 00:59:23.406
You're not one of them. Ivy.

872
00:59:23.472 --> 00:59:24.977
How do you know?

873
00:59:25.044 --> 00:59:30.527
Your real mom and dad were
happily married before they were
killed.

874
00:59:32.098 --> 00:59:34.740
Plus. when you were shot.
that ancient likely would've
sensed

875
00:59:34.807 --> 00:59:35.776
if you were a halfling.

876
00:59:37.615 --> 00:59:39.287
We're reviewing members
of your Order now.

877
00:59:39.354 --> 00:59:44.737
so far we've learned that Miles
is adopted
and there's at least one more.

878
00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:47.478
And when you find this person...

879
00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:50.855
you're gonna kill them.
aren't you?

880
00:59:52.025 --> 00:59:53.396
That's part of my job. Ivy.

881
01:00:04.027 --> 01:00:05.231
My best friend...

882
01:00:06.936 --> 01:00:11.918
His name was Noah Cobb.
We grew up together. like
brothers.

883
01:00:13.957 --> 01:00:14.927
What happened?

884
01:00:16.899 --> 01:00:17.969
He was raised in the Order.

885
01:00:20.008 --> 01:00:22.751
From what we gathered.
it was a one night stand.

886
01:00:22.817 --> 01:00:23.787
his father and the fae.

887
01:00:25.124 --> 01:00:26.461
She brought the child to him.

888
01:00:27.899 --> 01:00:32.412
The woman his father married
accepted Noah as her own.

889
01:00:33.549 --> 01:00:35.756
But they had no idea
what being a halfling meant.

890
01:00:39.166 --> 01:00:40.703
He knew what
I was being trained to do.

891
01:00:44.215 --> 01:00:45.418
There were no
secrets between us.

892
01:00:49.162 --> 01:00:50.333
It was an accident.

893
01:00:53.877 --> 01:00:55.047
But it was my fault...

894
01:01:05.712 --> 01:01:07.317
I brought out a thorn stake.

895
01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:12.834
We were in our backyard
screwing around.

896
01:01:12.901 --> 01:01:16.678
My dad was there. and so was
another member of the Elite.
Kyle.

897
01:01:17.548 --> 01:01:19.420
I let Noah pick up
the thorn stake.

898
01:01:21.928 --> 01:01:22.897
And he cut himself.

899
01:01:24.669 --> 01:01:29.216
When a thorn stake cuts a
halfling.
their blood bubbles.

900
01:01:29.283 --> 01:01:30.687
Noah's blood bubbled.

901
01:01:32.794 --> 01:01:35.970
My dad saw it and...
so did Kyle.

902
01:01:40.818 --> 01:01:41.786
Noah left...

903
01:01:44.528 --> 01:01:48.206
And I just stood there...
in that damn backyard.

904
01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:51.750
And then Kyle left.

905
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:56.230
I wanted to go after them.
but my dad stopped me.

906
01:01:59.841 --> 01:02:01.078
And Noah never made it home.

907
01:02:03.987 --> 01:02:04.588
Ren. I'm so sorry.

908
01:02:06.461 --> 01:02:10.238
To this day. I think about all
the things
that I could've done
differently.

909
01:02:10.305 --> 01:02:12.612
Like. if I never told him
about the Elite.

910
01:02:12.679 --> 01:02:16.624
then I never would've had
that thorn stake out there.

911
01:02:17.594 --> 01:02:18.664
He never would've cut himself.

912
01:02:18.731 --> 01:02:20.837
What happened to him
wasn't your fault.

913
01:02:22.843 --> 01:02:24.582
I didn't stop them
from killing him!

914
01:02:24.649 --> 01:02:26.488
What happened was terrible.

915
01:02:27.992 --> 01:02:30.400
and there are a lot of things
that could've been done
differently.

916
01:02:30.466 --> 01:02:32.606
but I doubt it
would've changed the outcome.

917
01:02:36.919 --> 01:02:37.922
I let him die.

918
01:02:46.146 --> 01:02:48.687
I don't ever wanna be
in that situation again.

919
01:04:11.903 --> 01:04:13.675
I like the way you look at me...

920
01:05:07.001 --> 01:05:08.339
Bake some brownies

921
01:05:09.041 --> 01:05:10.010
I'm a brownie

922
01:05:10.378 --> 01:05:11.949
Tink?

923
01:05:12.016 --> 01:05:15.828
You're interrupting my me time.
And you know baking is my me
time.

924
01:05:15.895 --> 01:05:18.202
When I found you by the
cemetery.
how far away from the gate you
were?

925
01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:22.247
I told you. I don't even
remember
coming through the gate.

926
01:05:22.314 --> 01:05:24.420
Did you know
there were two gates in the
city?

927
01:05:26.092 --> 01:05:28.399
No. There've never
been two gates.

928
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:31.809
Merle said there were
two gates in the city.

929
01:05:31.876 --> 01:05:33.514
one in an old sanctuary.

930
01:05:33.581 --> 01:05:36.590
and the other in a place where
"no spirits or humans could
rest."

931
01:05:36.657 --> 01:05:38.429
Two gates would be very bad.

932
01:05:38.797 --> 01:05:40.201
Yeah.

933
01:05:43.845 --> 01:05:45.115
Do you know about halflings?

934
01:05:46.854 --> 01:05:47.423
Why haven't you told me
about them before?

935
01:05:49.127 --> 01:05:51.167
Having that kind of information
would've been very helpful

936
01:05:51.234 --> 01:05:53.174
since I'm assuming
you're aware of what could
happen

937
01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:54.978
if the prince or princess
gets a hold of a halfling.

938
01:05:55.045 --> 01:05:56.951
I had one job and I failed.

939
01:05:57.018 --> 01:05:58.857
You're not an internet meme.

940
01:05:58.924 --> 01:06:00.963
My job was to destroy
the gate in New Orleans.

941
01:06:01.264 --> 01:06:03.136
What?

942
01:06:03.204 --> 01:06:06.580
If the blood of an ancient is
shed
on the doorway from inside the
Otherworld.

943
01:06:06.646 --> 01:06:08.319
it destroys the door.

944
01:06:08.385 --> 01:06:11.361
If the blood of an ancient is
shed
on the outside. it opens the
door.

945
01:06:12.598 --> 01:06:14.872
We destroyed all the gates
in the Otherworld

946
01:06:14.938 --> 01:06:16.711
by luring ancients to them
and killing them.

947
01:06:16.778 --> 01:06:18.917
Are you saying all the gates
have been rendered useless?

948
01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:20.355
We had no idea
there were two gates here.

949
01:06:22.427 --> 01:06:25.771
That's why I've never been too
concerned
about what the ancients are up
to.

950
01:06:25.838 --> 01:06:26.673
but if they have
discovered a second gate.

951
01:06:28.211 --> 01:06:30.217
they'll open it.
and the knights will come
through.

952
01:06:30.285 --> 01:06:32.524
They'll bring the princess
and prince and you...

953
01:06:33.427 --> 01:06:35.199
you do not want that to happen.

954
01:06:39.044 --> 01:06:41.351
Everything's fine. babe.

955
01:06:42.889 --> 01:06:47.168
Oh. I have to go. Yeah. no.
I'll call you and let you know.

956
01:06:48.305 --> 01:06:49.275
Bye.

957
01:06:50.378 --> 01:06:52.049
I am so sorry
about blowing you off yesterday.

958
01:06:52.919 --> 01:06:54.490
Were you with the guy
you're seeing?

959
01:06:54.557 --> 01:06:58.803
Okay. actually I needed to sleep
in.
because he blew my back out...

960
01:06:58.870 --> 01:06:59.973
I get the picture.

961
01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:02.381
- I get it. that's enough.
- He blew it out.

962
01:07:02.447 --> 01:07:05.390
Like. I have no more back.
Back is gone. but...

963
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:15.620
Wow.

964
01:07:16.556 --> 01:07:18.027
I think I just got pregnant.

965
01:07:19.365 --> 01:07:21.538
I've been waiting all day
for you to text or call me.

966
01:07:22.942 --> 01:07:24.747
It's okay. you're out
of practice.

967
01:07:24.815 --> 01:07:27.656
but I want to hear from you
day. night. morning.

968
01:07:27.723 --> 01:07:29.495
And I've got no problem
with anyone knowing

969
01:07:29.562 --> 01:07:31.368
what you and I both
got going on.

970
01:07:33.206 --> 01:07:35.245
David. you got a minute?

971
01:07:36.315 --> 01:07:37.987
Do I wanna have a minute?

972
01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:39.692
Yes. Yes. you do.

973
01:07:42.199 --> 01:07:42.434
What are you doing?

974
01:07:44.005 --> 01:07:47.683
We need to talk to him.
I found some stuff out. Trust
me.

975
01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:04.767
I didn't invite you.

976
01:08:06.305 --> 01:08:08.512
Whatever is said in this room
goes no further.

977
01:08:08.579 --> 01:08:10.083
Hot and obvious.

978
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:11.521
Make this quick.

979
01:08:14.830 --> 01:08:17.271
And they're planning on opening
the gate on the equinox on
Wednesday.

980
01:08:17.739 --> 01:08:18.274
In two days.

981
01:08:19.310 --> 01:08:21.518
She's not bullshitting you.
They're here.

982
01:08:21.584 --> 01:08:23.891
They've been in a club downtown
that caters to fae.

983
01:08:23.958 --> 01:08:26.699
I'm surprised you've actually
seen
a fae since you've been here.

984
01:08:26.766 --> 01:08:28.973
because I'm pretty sure
the only thing you've been
concentrating on

985
01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:30.445
is how to get in that
girl's pants.

986
01:08:30.511 --> 01:08:33.687
That's an unjust observation.
David.
I can multitask.

987
01:08:35.793 --> 01:08:38.802
The ancients are going to open
the gate
and we know there are two in the
city.

988
01:08:40.173 --> 01:08:42.447
And the one by the cemetery
isn't working anymore.

989
01:08:42.514 --> 01:08:44.820
How the hell do you know
the location of that gate?

990
01:08:44.887 --> 01:08:47.361
Does it matter?
I also know about the halflings

991
01:08:47.428 --> 01:08:49.869
and what will happen if the
prince
or princess comes through the
gate

992
01:08:49.935 --> 01:08:51.106
and gets their hands on one.

993
01:08:51.173 --> 01:08:52.878
Halfling? What the hell
are you talking about?

994
01:08:52.945 --> 01:08:56.623
A half human. half fae.
If you don't listen to me

995
01:08:56.689 --> 01:08:59.297
and put every member you have
on the other gate in this city.

996
01:08:59.364 --> 01:08:59.865
they're going to get through.

997
01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:02.941
and whether you believe
in halflings or not.

998
01:09:03.009 --> 01:09:04.513
we're gonna have
a huge friggin' mess on our
hands.

999
01:09:05.683 --> 01:09:07.054
If she's saying
that there are two gates

1000
01:09:07.121 --> 01:09:08.191
and that one of them
isn't working.

1001
01:09:08.257 --> 01:09:10.330
you need to tell me
where that gate is.

1002
01:09:10.397 --> 01:09:13.005
Pull your fucking resources.
and get it guarded now.

1003
01:09:14.108 --> 01:09:17.017
Everyone but you...
out of the room.

1004
01:09:34.369 --> 01:09:36.074
You know what
the really bad thing is?

1005
01:09:37.646 --> 01:09:39.919
Someone in the Order
is working with the fae.

1006
01:09:40.922 --> 01:09:42.493
It's the only thing
that makes sense.

1007
01:09:43.396 --> 01:09:44.465
How does that make sense?

1008
01:09:45.703 --> 01:09:48.077
All the members
who've been killed were
guardians.

1009
01:09:49.949 --> 01:09:53.492
There's this club
where I overheard an ancient say

1010
01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:55.098
they know the
location of the gate.

1011
01:09:57.071 --> 01:09:58.040
Holy crap.

1012
01:10:01.684 --> 01:10:04.492
I have to go. but...
I'll call you later?

1013
01:10:17.431 --> 01:10:18.835
You know we found Trent's phone.

1014
01:10:20.675 --> 01:10:23.583
There's pictures of you and Ren.
by Jackson Square.

1015
01:10:23.650 --> 01:10:25.221
looking mighty close.

1016
01:10:26.325 --> 01:10:27.494
Well. that's kind of creepy.

1017
01:10:27.561 --> 01:10:28.999
That was the night
he was killed.

1018
01:10:30.771 --> 01:10:32.944
You know why he was taking
those pictures?

1019
01:10:34.148 --> 01:10:34.717
He didn't trust you.

1020
01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:41.336
He was worried that you'd
become...
influenced by the fae.

1021
01:10:41.403 --> 01:10:43.008
Why the hell would
he think that?

1022
01:10:44.077 --> 01:10:45.716
I'd have to be
without my clover for that.

1023
01:10:46.518 --> 01:10:48.659
Something about your past. Ivy.

1024
01:10:48.725 --> 01:10:51.868
pointed out things
that just didn't add up.

1025
01:10:53.506 --> 01:10:56.615
Miles. I need to see you. Now.

1026
01:11:03.704 --> 01:11:04.907
Where are we going?

1027
01:11:08.685 --> 01:11:11.259
Holding hands is something that
people do
when they like each other. Ivy.

1028
01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:17.110
David will have
both gates guarded.

1029
01:11:17.177 --> 01:11:18.815
He doesn't believe
that one isn't working

1030
01:11:18.882 --> 01:11:21.758
and isn't willing to risk
leaving
the other one unguarded.

1031
01:11:21.824 --> 01:11:23.128
Where did you hear
about the other gate not
working?

1032
01:11:24.064 --> 01:11:27.307
I... saw Merle this morning.

1033
01:11:27.374 --> 01:11:29.547
She said the gate by the
cemetery
wasn't working anymore.

1034
01:11:29.614 --> 01:11:33.994
And that all the gates had been
destroyed
except for the second one.

1035
01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:35.063
Did David tell you where it is?

1036
01:11:36.201 --> 01:11:37.337
We're standing right
in front of it.

1037
01:11:47.434 --> 01:11:48.671
Come home with me. Ivy.

1038
01:11:51.613 --> 01:11:52.851
I don't know...

1039
01:11:52.917 --> 01:11:54.923
I'm not gonna take you
to my place and ravish you.

1040
01:11:56.127 --> 01:11:57.832
If you don't want that from me.
then...

1041
01:11:57.899 --> 01:11:59.838
I do want that from you.
Always.

1042
01:12:01.844 --> 01:12:05.220
Hell. it's all I've been
thinking about
since the first time you took a
swing at me.

1043
01:12:08.564 --> 01:12:10.035
But it's not the only
thing I want.

1044
01:12:21.168 --> 01:12:23.877
There's something
I wanna show you. give you.

1045
01:12:28.757 --> 01:12:32.736
It's a thorn stake.
so you can kill an ancient.

1046
01:12:37.451 --> 01:12:41.296
I can't say a guy has ever given
me
a weapon of stabby awesome
before.

1047
01:12:45.007 --> 01:12:48.450
For tonight. let's just be...
normal.

1048
01:12:49.587 --> 01:12:51.326
Like those people we
saw in the diner.

1049
01:12:56.741 --> 01:12:58.414
We should probably
put this away then.

1050
01:13:42.446 --> 01:13:43.415
Ready for bed?

1051
01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:48.363
It's really late.
I'm not suggesting anything.

1052
01:13:48.430 --> 01:13:49.935
just stay with me.

1053
01:13:51.573 --> 01:13:52.341
In your bed?

1054
01:13:53.812 --> 01:13:56.956
It's a big bed.
Like three people could sleep in
there.

1055
01:13:57.992 --> 01:14:00.165
And I have a shirt
if you wanna change into.

1056
01:14:20.693 --> 01:14:23.602
Wearing my shirt might not
have been one of my brightest
ideas.

1057
01:14:25.775 --> 01:14:28.450
I'm guessing you've never worn
a guy's clothes before?

1058
01:14:29.487 --> 01:14:32.562
Shaun and I...
we never got to that point.

1059
01:14:36.273 --> 01:14:39.115
Make yourself comfortable.
I'll be right out.

1060
01:15:15.056 --> 01:15:16.561
I'm happy you're here.

1061
01:15:18.366 --> 01:15:19.335
Are you?

1062
01:15:19.770 --> 01:15:20.773
Yeah.

1063
01:15:38.894 --> 01:15:40.666
That's all I wanted to hear.

1064
01:16:05.641 --> 01:16:06.576
What are you doing?

1065
01:16:07.279 --> 01:16:08.617
Waking you up.

1066
01:16:10.455 --> 01:16:12.461
You were all tangled up with me.

1067
01:16:14.267 --> 01:16:15.671
You're a cuddler.

1068
01:16:15.738 --> 01:16:16.874
Nuh-uh.

1069
01:17:10.033 --> 01:17:11.204
God. you're beautiful.

1070
01:18:09.512 --> 01:18:10.715
Can I keep you?

1071
01:18:22.517 --> 01:18:23.822
Hey. what's wrong?

1072
01:18:24.523 --> 01:18:25.393
I have to go.

1073
01:18:26.028 --> 01:18:27.900
Whoa. Ivy. talk to me.

1074
01:18:30.441 --> 01:18:33.885
Did we move too fast?
Did I hurt you?

1075
01:18:34.922 --> 01:18:38.900
No. You didn't hurt me...
Not yet.

1076
01:18:40.772 --> 01:18:41.708
Not yet?

1077
01:18:42.344 --> 01:18:43.547
You wouldn't mean to.

1078
01:18:43.614 --> 01:18:44.583
You'll promise me
everything will be okay.

1079
01:18:45.955 --> 01:18:48.061
and then it won't be
because you can't control it.

1080
01:18:48.127 --> 01:18:50.668
Let me get dressed though.
I'll take you home.

1081
01:18:50.735 --> 01:18:53.711
No. I don't need you
to do anything.

1082
01:18:54.848 --> 01:18:58.291
You're a great guy.
but this. whatever this is.

1083
01:18:58.359 --> 01:19:00.297
isn't going any further.

1084
01:19:00.365 --> 01:19:01.534
This was a mistake.

1085
01:19:26.141 --> 01:19:29.117
Hi. this is Val.
Leave me a message after the
beep.

1086
01:19:44.697 --> 01:19:47.706
EMERGENCY MEETING
OF THE ORDER

1087
01:19:52.854 --> 01:19:53.624
Oh. my God. what happened?

1088
01:19:55.128 --> 01:19:57.836
I ran into a fae last night.
It didn't wanna go down easy.

1089
01:20:02.985 --> 01:20:03.854
Odd.

1090
01:20:04.222 --> 01:20:04.690
What?

1091
01:20:05.693 --> 01:20:07.364
Yesterday you and Ren
were locking lips.

1092
01:20:07.431 --> 01:20:08.735
and today he's
standing over there.

1093
01:20:08.802 --> 01:20:10.741
looking like he wants to put
his fist through the wall.

1094
01:20:10.808 --> 01:20:13.817
It's a long story.
I tried calling you earlier.

1095
01:20:14.553 --> 01:20:17.863
Yeah... I'm sorry.

1096
01:20:26.355 --> 01:20:30.033
We now know that tomorrow night.

1097
01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:33.911
on the equinox.
could very well be the fae
apocalypse.

1098
01:20:35.816 --> 01:20:37.756
We could be facing
the ultimate fight.

1099
01:20:39.294 --> 01:20:42.269
We cannot allow
an ancient near the gate.

1100
01:20:43.406 --> 01:20:44.409
Their blood will open it.

1101
01:20:46.381 --> 01:20:48.387
We need to keep them back.
no matter what.

1102
01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:55.108
With all that being said.
there will be no patrols
tonight.

1103
01:20:56.211 --> 01:20:59.487
If you have family.
I suggest you go home.

1104
01:20:59.555 --> 01:21:00.523
spend time with them.

1105
01:21:01.761 --> 01:21:03.266
If you don't have
anyone special.

1106
01:21:04.335 --> 01:21:05.840
I suggest you use tonight
to find someone.

1107
01:21:07.044 --> 01:21:10.053
Some of you will not be
coming home tomorrow night.

1108
01:21:11.724 --> 01:21:12.894
That's all.

1109
01:21:16.238 --> 01:21:19.748
Got plans for tonight?
I can't guarantee you'll get
laid though.

1110
01:21:20.985 --> 01:21:25.532
Hmm... I think I'm gonna go
see my parents. okay?

1111
01:21:48.401 --> 01:21:50.173
For someone
who is so strong and brave.

1112
01:21:51.243 --> 01:21:52.781
I never would've thought
you'd be such a coward

1113
01:21:52.847 --> 01:21:53.917
when it really counts.

1114
01:21:53.984 --> 01:21:55.923
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

1115
01:21:56.491 --> 01:21:59.267
Then tell me. Ivy.

1116
01:22:46.441 --> 01:22:48.514
All of us have lost someone.
Ivy.

1117
01:22:50.587 --> 01:22:52.091
Make me understand.

1118
01:23:09.377 --> 01:23:11.516
If you tell me to leave.
I'll walk away. I swear.

1119
01:23:13.857 --> 01:23:15.461
I’m not going down
without trying.

1120
01:23:27.966 --> 01:23:30.340
Ivy. talk to me.

1121
01:23:35.187 --> 01:23:37.193
I had just taken
the mark of the Order.

1122
01:23:38.965 --> 01:23:44.247
I was... supposed to meet Shaun
at this restaurant in the city

1123
01:23:45.351 --> 01:23:48.092
and I dressed up for it.

1124
01:23:51.971 --> 01:23:53.509
I put on this...

1125
01:23:56.083 --> 01:23:57.822
silver chain

1126
01:23:57.889 --> 01:23:59.460
because it matched the dress.

1127
01:24:03.606 --> 01:24:04.609
I...

1128
01:24:07.016 --> 01:24:09.690
took off my protective clover.

1129
01:24:15.073 --> 01:24:16.478
I was at the metro
and I saw a fae.

1130
01:24:20.423 --> 01:24:22.295
She must've recognized me

1131
01:24:22.362 --> 01:24:28.414
because all I remember
is her making a beeline for me.

1132
01:24:29.617 --> 01:24:30.820
right in public.

1133
01:24:32.994 --> 01:24:34.465
Before I could do anything...

1134
01:24:36.371 --> 01:24:37.674
The fae compelled you.

1135
01:24:39.747 --> 01:24:42.589
I don't remember her telling me
to take her to my house.

1136
01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:52.920
I just remember... being home...

1137
01:24:55.762 --> 01:24:56.865
in my living room.

1138
01:25:02.181 --> 01:25:03.920
I remember...

1139
01:25:05.057 --> 01:25:08.901
seeing my dad... lying
on the floor.

1140
01:25:11.643 --> 01:25:15.287
His stake...

1141
01:25:17.059 --> 01:25:18.831
was in his chest.

1142
01:25:23.947 --> 01:25:26.755
And the fae. she practically
put me through a wall.

1143
01:25:30.365 --> 01:25:32.271
My mom tried to help...

1144
01:25:36.016 --> 01:25:37.687
but the fae snapped her neck.

1145
01:25:44.407 --> 01:25:46.380
And then Shaun showed up...

1146
01:25:50.125 --> 01:25:51.061
looking for me.

1147
01:25:56.243 --> 01:26:00.923
She didn't... outright kill him.

1148
01:26:02.896 --> 01:26:07.644
No. She toyed with him.

1149
01:26:14.264 --> 01:26:15.433
It’s my fault.

1150
01:26:16.704 --> 01:26:18.877
I'm responsible for all
their deaths!

1151
01:26:18.944 --> 01:26:19.980
Ivy. no...

1152
01:26:20.048 --> 01:26:22.021
That fae fed on me too...

1153
01:26:23.625 --> 01:26:25.898
would have drained me
if another Order member hadn't
shown up.

1154
01:26:27.303 --> 01:26:29.743
They couldn't figure out
how the fae got in the house.

1155
01:26:31.616 --> 01:26:33.454
I could never
tell them the truth.

1156
01:26:41.646 --> 01:26:44.320
I don't even know
why I'm telling you all this.

1157
01:26:44.387 --> 01:26:50.238
It's not... justification
for how I behaved.

1158
01:26:50.305 --> 01:26:52.177
It's not an excuse.

1159
01:26:52.244 --> 01:26:53.782
I know you're not
making excuses.

1160
01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:57.493
You made a shit choice
when you were young.

1161
01:26:58.162 --> 01:26:59.633
God knows I understand.

1162
01:27:00.502 --> 01:27:01.973
It's not the same.

1163
01:27:03.043 --> 01:27:07.256
It's not?
My best friend was killed

1164
01:27:07.323 --> 01:27:08.827
and I did next to
nothing to stop it.

1165
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.140
You can't tell me
I can't feel guilt over what
happened.

1166
01:27:15.045 --> 01:27:19.459
Maybe neither of us
can truly forgive ourselves.

1167
01:27:20.595 --> 01:27:22.769
The only thing we can do
is learn from our mistakes

1168
01:27:24.173 --> 01:27:24.942
and not make them again.

1169
01:27:26.279 --> 01:27:30.592
I've lost everyone I loved.
I've lost everyone.

1170
01:27:30.660 --> 01:27:32.231
You haven't lost me.

1171
01:27:32.297 --> 01:27:33.702
But what if?

1172
01:27:40.221 --> 01:27:41.826
Tomorrow we could die...

1173
01:27:43.597 --> 01:27:47.176
or we could live.

1174
01:27:47.242 --> 01:27:48.612
But we're both here. right now.

1175
01:28:41.371 --> 01:28:42.608
I want you.

1176
01:30:17.626 --> 01:30:18.595
Is this okay?

1177
01:31:08.947 --> 01:31:10.585
You really are wicked.

1178
01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:34.455
Someone's hungry.

1179
01:31:34.824 --> 01:31:36.061
Maybe.

1180
01:31:54.182 --> 01:31:56.221
You owned me with just one kiss.

1181
01:32:01.804 --> 01:32:03.242
I'm getting us breakfast.

1182
01:32:16.048 --> 01:32:17.251
I wasn't doing anything!

1183
01:32:17.318 --> 01:32:19.057
You were in her kitchen.
Eating her Frosted Flakes.

1184
01:32:19.123 --> 01:32:20.527
What in the actual fuck?

1185
01:32:20.595 --> 01:32:23.837
I always eat her cereal.
and you're naked. completely
naked!

1186
01:32:23.904 --> 01:32:26.545
I can explain. Ren.
but I need you to let him go.

1187
01:32:26.613 --> 01:32:27.582
You heard the woman.

1188
01:32:28.952 --> 01:32:30.123
You want me to let
this thing go?

1189
01:32:30.190 --> 01:32:33.332
He's my thing. I mean.
he's not a thing.

1190
01:32:33.399 --> 01:32:35.138
He's a brownie. and he's okay.

1191
01:32:35.205 --> 01:32:36.576
He's not gonna hurt anything.

1192
01:32:36.643 --> 01:32:38.715
What do you mean he's yours?
I come into the kitchen

1193
01:32:38.782 --> 01:32:42.359
and he's sitting in a bowl
of Frosted Flakes like a talking
rat.

1194
01:32:42.426 --> 01:32:44.633
- I'm not a rat. you
overgrown...
- Tink!

1195
01:32:45.936 --> 01:32:47.040
His name is Tink?

1196
01:32:47.107 --> 01:32:48.879
Well. that's what I call him.

1197
01:32:50.985 --> 01:32:53.927
Am I high? I gotta be high.

1198
01:32:55.833 --> 01:32:57.204
Is he wearing doll pants?

1199
01:32:57.271 --> 01:32:58.441
What's it to you?

1200
01:32:58.507 --> 01:33:00.781
I'm sorry.
I should've warned you...

1201
01:33:00.848 --> 01:33:02.085
You should've warned me.

1202
01:33:02.152 --> 01:33:04.525
I'm the one who had to see
his dong swinging around.

1203
01:33:04.592 --> 01:33:08.371
Tink! Okay.
I can explain everything.

1204
01:33:08.437 --> 01:33:11.413
but I need you to let him go.

1205
01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:15.592
and... you should probably
put something on.

1206
01:33:20.741 --> 01:33:21.711
Oh. my God!

1207
01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:36.120
What were you doing?
You had to know he was here.

1208
01:33:36.188 --> 01:33:39.664
Oh I know. I heard.
I didn't think he'd stay the
night.

1209
01:33:39.732 --> 01:33:41.303
One night stands don't
stay the night.

1210
01:33:41.369 --> 01:33:42.439
Not a one night stand. asshole!

1211
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:47.956
Him? Really? You decide to dust
the cobwebs off with him?

1212
01:33:48.022 --> 01:33:50.263
Nothing is wrong with him.
you little jackass.

1213
01:33:52.236 --> 01:33:54.542
No one knows about him.
Not even Val.

1214
01:33:55.545 --> 01:33:57.551
He's a creature
of the Otherworld. Ivy.

1215
01:33:57.618 --> 01:34:00.660
I found him a couple of years
ago.
badly hurt. by the cemetery.

1216
01:34:00.728 --> 01:34:02.466
I'd never seen a brownie before

1217
01:34:02.533 --> 01:34:04.438
and even though
I was supposed to finish him
off.

1218
01:34:04.505 --> 01:34:06.445
I took him home and healed him.

1219
01:34:07.381 --> 01:34:09.119
You know how powerful
brownies can be?

1220
01:34:09.186 --> 01:34:10.657
He's good at cleaning the house.

1221
01:34:13.265 --> 01:34:14.736
So you basically
have a pet brownie?

1222
01:34:15.906 --> 01:34:17.946
I wouldn't necessarily
call him a pet.

1223
01:34:18.012 --> 01:34:19.584
Then what do you call him?

1224
01:34:19.650 --> 01:34:22.659
I call him... Tink.
He's my friend.

1225
01:34:24.164 --> 01:34:24.967
And I protect her.

1226
01:34:25.836 --> 01:34:26.806
I wouldn't go that far.

1227
01:34:28.577 --> 01:34:31.085
Brownies hate the fae. Ren.

1228
01:34:31.151 --> 01:34:32.389
They aren't the enemy.

1229
01:34:32.456 --> 01:34:34.262
The brownies have destroyed
almost all the gates

1230
01:34:34.328 --> 01:34:35.498
from inside the Otherworld.

1231
01:34:37.103 --> 01:34:39.945
That's how I know
about the gates being destroyed.

1232
01:34:40.881 --> 01:34:44.325
Merle didn't tell me.
It was Tink.

1233
01:34:44.392 --> 01:34:45.695
Please don't tell
anyone about him.

1234
01:34:46.999 --> 01:34:51.613
I don't trust the little shit.
but I respect your decision.

1235
01:34:52.850 --> 01:34:55.926
Well. I don't trust you either.
so what-the-fuck-ever.

1236
01:34:57.063 --> 01:35:00.172
You gave Tink a scarf.
Tink is free!

1237
01:35:01.509 --> 01:35:04.685
Jesus. A fucking brownie.
I was not expecting that.

1238
01:35:11.439 --> 01:35:14.682
Listen. tonight's gonna be hard.

1239
01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:17.825
I just wanna make today
special for you.

1240
01:36:28.604 --> 01:36:29.740
Don't go tonight.

1241
01:36:30.710 --> 01:36:32.883
I have to. It's my job.
you know that.

1242
01:36:33.852 --> 01:36:37.764
Ivy. please be careful.
because there...

1243
01:36:37.831 --> 01:36:41.041
There are worse things
than death if that gate opens.

1244
01:37:05.413 --> 01:37:07.319
You make sure
you walk back down those stairs.
Ivy.

1245
01:37:08.724 --> 01:37:09.894
You. too.

1246
01:37:18.687 --> 01:37:19.255
Thank you for today.

1247
01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:25.340
It was probably my favorite day
in... well. forever.

1248
01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:27.279
Me too.

1249
01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:32.696
So... where's the gate?

1250
01:37:32.762 --> 01:37:33.999
It's in the master bedroom.

1251
01:37:50.382 --> 01:37:51.753
Oh. my God.

1252
01:37:55.765 --> 01:37:57.035
That is crazy.

1253
01:38:03.287 --> 01:38:05.360
We can't let an ancient
near the door.

1254
01:38:05.427 --> 01:38:07.968
If one happens to get close.
do not cut it.

1255
01:38:08.034 --> 01:38:11.211
their blood opens the gate.
Push them back.

1256
01:38:16.426 --> 01:38:17.396
It's time!

1257
01:38:45.547 --> 01:38:46.516
They're here.

1258
01:38:53.136 --> 01:38:54.106
Hold!

1259
01:39:22.859 --> 01:39:24.029
Ivy!

1260
01:39:52.347 --> 01:39:53.317
Ren!

1261
01:39:54.554 --> 01:39:55.590
Hello there!

1262
01:39:58.031 --> 01:40:00.070
Guess what? You failed!

1263
01:40:22.404 --> 01:40:23.574
Val! No!

1264
01:41:14.895 --> 01:41:16.131
It's the prince!

1265
01:41:39.970 --> 01:41:40.939
Doc!

1266
01:41:42.979 --> 01:41:43.948
Valerie!

1267
01:41:44.850 --> 01:41:46.623
- Ivy...
- Why?

1268
01:41:47.726 --> 01:41:50.635
I wish it hadn't been you
that chased after me.

1269
01:41:59.462 --> 01:42:03.306
Your hair. It's the
color of fire.

1270
01:42:05.045 --> 01:42:07.351
It's rather... abrasive.

1271
01:42:08.655 --> 01:42:10.561
I'm not here
to talk about my hair.

1272
01:42:11.330 --> 01:42:12.534
You're here to fight me then?

1273
01:42:13.136 --> 01:42:14.507
I'm here to end you.

1274
01:42:15.408 --> 01:42:20.257
You humor me.
I'm feeling... kind.

1275
01:42:21.426 --> 01:42:22.965
I shall let you live.

1276
01:42:28.549 --> 01:42:30.588
A thorn birch stake
from the Otherworld. I presume?

1277
01:42:30.989 --> 01:42:32.393
You betcha.

1278
01:42:32.460 --> 01:42:34.600
And you think that you can use
it
successfully against me?

1279
01:42:35.736 --> 01:42:37.843
That is silly.

1280
01:42:39.180 --> 01:42:40.417
You talk too much.

1281
01:42:41.554 --> 01:42:43.326
I do not wish to harm a female.

1282
01:42:43.392 --> 01:42:46.368
but my kindness
is rapidly diminishing.

1283
01:42:48.140 --> 01:42:49.812
I give you one last chance.

1284
01:42:49.879 --> 01:42:54.025
But you will not like how this
ends.
my lovely little bird.

1285
01:42:54.092 --> 01:42:56.933
I'm not your anything. buddy.

1286
01:43:01.948 --> 01:43:02.717
What did you do to Val?

1287
01:43:03.921 --> 01:43:09.270
I did nothing. I think she is.
perhaps. intelligent?

1288
01:43:09.337 --> 01:43:10.675
She knows we cannot be stopped.

1289
01:43:11.978 --> 01:43:15.556
No. She would never willingly
help your kind.

1290
01:43:15.623 --> 01:43:17.094
If that makes you feel better.

1291
01:43:19.735 --> 01:43:20.738
Too slow.

1292
01:43:21.908 --> 01:43:24.482
You cannot fight me.
little bird.

1293
01:43:33.175 --> 01:43:37.656
I no longer have any patience
or kindness left in me.

1294
01:43:44.007 --> 01:43:45.145
Fly. little birdie.

1295
01:44:16.505 --> 01:44:18.945
You should've left
when you had the chance. little
birdie.

1296
01:44:25.766 --> 01:44:26.836
No!

1297
01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:31.651
Halfling.

1298
01:44:39.039 --> 01:44:40.008
Ivy!

1299
01:44:43.185 --> 01:44:44.255
Ivy!

1300
01:44:45.291 --> 01:44:46.261
Ivy. stay with me.

1301
01:44:48.702 --> 01:44:51.142
Ivy! Stay with me.

1302
01:45:12.707 --> 01:45:13.977
Hey there. sleepy-butt.

1303
01:45:15.315 --> 01:45:16.351
Hey.

1304
01:45:23.539 --> 01:45:24.709
I thought...

1305
01:45:26.013 --> 01:45:27.317
when I saw you in that room...

1306
01:45:30.895 --> 01:45:35.308
I'm okay... I think.

1307
01:45:39.152 --> 01:45:44.067
The knights...
the prince. they got out.

1308
01:45:46.374 --> 01:45:49.149
Strangely. it wasn't the giant
apocalypse
we thought it would be.

1309
01:45:50.420 --> 01:45:51.389
The Order...

1310
01:45:53.429 --> 01:45:56.070
or what's left of the Order.
has been on patrol.

1311
01:45:57.106 --> 01:45:58.845
We haven't seen
a single knight or that...

1312
01:46:06.735 --> 01:46:09.175
David and a few
are heading to Flux tonight.

1313
01:46:09.242 --> 01:46:11.817
but I have a feeling
they aren't gonna find anything.

1314
01:46:13.689 --> 01:46:15.294
We managed to get
the gates closed again.

1315
01:46:19.239 --> 01:46:20.343
Have you found Val?

1316
01:46:20.410 --> 01:46:21.379
No.

1317
01:46:22.817 --> 01:46:24.990
No one's seen her.
not even her family.

1318
01:46:26.795 --> 01:46:28.801
She was carrying something. Ren.

1319
01:46:29.972 --> 01:46:33.382
She went to the headquarters
for a reason.

1320
01:46:35.053 --> 01:46:36.090
I know.

1321
01:46:45.953 --> 01:46:48.360
That was crazy
going after the prince.

1322
01:46:50.633 --> 01:46:51.836
You could've died.

1323
01:46:54.612 --> 01:46:55.815
I don't know what I
would've done.

1324
01:46:56.216 --> 01:46:57.353
I'm here.

1325
01:47:02.402 --> 01:47:03.872
How bad do I look?

1326
01:47:05.979 --> 01:47:07.484
You've never looked better.

1327
01:47:18.216 --> 01:47:19.887
I'm gonna have to go
back to the Order.

1328
01:48:03.919 --> 01:48:05.423
Aren't you supposed
to be at work?

1329
01:48:06.059 --> 01:48:07.429
You're not my keeper.

1330
01:48:17.259 --> 01:48:20.001
I just wanted to stop by real
quick.
Make sure you're okay.

1331
01:48:20.068 --> 01:48:21.371
You could've texted me.

1332
01:48:22.876 --> 01:48:24.047
Wait.

1333
01:48:25.016 --> 01:48:26.955
What's that smell?

1334
01:48:34.444 --> 01:48:35.013
I really don't like that thing.

1335
01:48:36.618 --> 01:48:39.693
I'm sure the feeling is mutual.
but thank you for the beignets.

1336
01:48:42.368 --> 01:48:44.440
It was really just an excuse
to come see you.

1337
01:48:46.113 --> 01:48:47.751
I hate the idea
of leaving you alone right now.

1338
01:48:48.452 --> 01:48:50.091
I'm not alone.

1339
01:48:50.158 --> 01:48:51.228
That little freak doesn't count.

1340
01:48:51.295 --> 01:48:53.301
Hey. he's my freak.

1341
01:48:57.814 --> 01:48:59.152
Are you sure you're okay?

1342
01:49:00.288 --> 01:49:02.629
I'm okay. I swear.

1343
01:49:04.032 --> 01:49:05.805
I plan on showering.
crashing on the couch

1344
01:49:05.871 --> 01:49:10.085
and then hopefully.
if Tink doesn't devour them all.

1345
01:49:10.151 --> 01:49:13.026
eating sugary goodness
until I pass out.

1346
01:49:15.901 --> 01:49:17.273
I'll be home as soon as I can.

1347
01:50:00.635 --> 01:50:03.511
When a thorn stake cuts a
halfling.
their blood bubbles.

1348
01:50:10.933 --> 01:50:12.237
What are you doing?

1349
01:50:13.307 --> 01:50:14.712
The prince was gonna kill me.

1350
01:50:16.183 --> 01:50:19.392
But he healed me.
and he said halfling.

1351
01:50:22.267 --> 01:50:23.905
When I was bleeding...

1352
01:50:26.078 --> 01:50:28.920
he said... halfling.

1353
01:50:30.693 --> 01:50:31.394
Ivy.

1354
01:50:32.631 --> 01:50:35.172
Brownies have always been able
to sense the Otherworld

1355
01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:38.014
in other creatures.
no matter how minimal.

1356
01:50:40.790 --> 01:50:44.433
It wasn't a coincidence
