00:02:04.253 --> 00:02:06.432
Hello. hello?

4
00:02:06.482 --> 00:02:09.345
Sis

5
00:02:10.362 --> 00:02:13.293
- Sick. what do you mean she's sick?

6
00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:17.122
She's sick.

7
00:02:17.172 --> 00:02:19.640
I went into her room and
she could hardly breathe.

8
00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:20.656
- What's wrong honey?

9
00:02:20.706 --> 00:02:22.910
- It's my sister. she's
saying that my mom is sick.

10
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.740
and they're taking her to the hospital.

11
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:25.798
- What!
- What hospital?

12
00:02:25.848 --> 00:02:28.680
They are taking
her to St. Christopher's.

13
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.367
I've already called Dr. Madison.

14
00:02:30.417 --> 00:02:31.561
she's meeting us there okay?

15
00:02:32.586 --> 00:02:35.050
- Okay. okay sis.
everything's gonna be okay.

16
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.680
I'm on my way. okay?

17
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.080
I know. I know.

18
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.560
but she was just having
such a hard time breathing.

19
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:43.990
- Okay look. I'm on my way.

20
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.913

21
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.300
I'll be there shortly. okay?

22
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:49.379
Okay. I'll see you there.

23
00:02:49.403 --> 00:02:51.890
- I love you. okay bye.

24
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.618
Babe-
- Everything okay?

25
00:02:53.668 --> 00:02:54.659
- No. it's my mom.

26
00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.857
they're taking her to the
hospital in the ambulance.

27
00:02:56.907 --> 00:02:58.228
I don't know what's going on.

28
00:03:00.336 --> 00:03:01.482
Look. I gotta go. Okay?

29
00:03:01.532 --> 00:03:02.699
- Okay honey.

30
00:03:59.992 --> 00:04:01.191
Hey honey.

31
00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:06.383
I want you to be careful.

32
00:04:06.433 --> 00:04:07.299
- I will.

33
00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.023
- Don't worry everything will be fine.

34
00:04:10.073 --> 00:04:13.709
Call me. Okay?

35
00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:15.346
- Okay.
- Be careful.

36
00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:17.775
I love you.

37
00:04:21.448 --> 00:04:23.531
- Be careful.
- Okay. bye.

38
00:04:48.715 --> 00:04:51.510
Are you okay?
- Natalie no. mom's real sick.

39
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.056
- She's gonna be okay.
she's gonna be fine.

40
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.880
- Natalie. it's good to see you again.

41
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.300
I just wish it were under
better circumstances.

42
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.210
- Yes. good to see you too doctor.

43
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.650
- So tell me how's Alvin?

44
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.296
- Alvin's good. thank you for asking.

45
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.260
- Ladies. this is Dr. Taylor.

46
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.750
she is the hospital's
respiratory specialist.

47
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.420
so I'm gonna allow her. to take
the time to explain to you.

48
00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.643
exactly what is going on
with your mom. Dr. Taylor.

49
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.950
- Natalie. Cynthia. right?

50
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.330
- Yes. that's correct.
- Correct.

51
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.537
- Okay great. it's nice
to meet both of you.

52
00:05:31.587 --> 00:05:33.760
but as Dr. Madison has said.

53
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.004
I wish it was under
different circumstances.

54
00:05:36.054 --> 00:05:37.380
- Yeah.

55
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.200
- My name is Dr. Marianne Taylor.

56
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.680
and I'm the respiratory specialist.

57
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.230
that saw your mom when she first came in.

58
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.420
Now as we all know.
we're currently battling.

59
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.600
with the respiratory
virus called COVID-19.

60
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.700
Due to that. and the symptoms
that your mom displayed.

61
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.630
when she first came into the hospital.

62
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.970
we immediately administered
her a COVID-19 test.

63
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.777
So right now we're waiting on
the test results to come back.

64
00:05:59.827 --> 00:06:01.960
and we put your mom on oxygen.

65
00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.510
so. help assist with her breathing okay?

66
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.460
- So. you're saying that our
mom has the COVID-19 virus?

67
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.350
- No. I'm not drawing
that conclusion as of yet.

68
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.810
I wanna wait for the test
results to come back.

69
00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.110
and once I have a clear diagnosis.

70
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.116
I can be on point with the
next course of treatment

71
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.175
for your mother.

72
00:06:19.225 --> 00:06:21.880
So when are we
gonna be allowed to see her now?

73
00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.120
- I'm afraid that won't be possible.

74
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.020
- So we can't see her?

75
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.720
- No. due to the protocols
that have been put into place.

76
00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.640
because of the outbreak.

77
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.420
anyone displaying symptoms of COVID-19.

78
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.488
are immediately quarantined.

79
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.010
So right now all we can do.

80
00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.650
is make her as comfortable as possible.

81
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.570
and her breathing is a little bit better.

82
00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.686
but she's still struggling.

83
00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.900
- So. do you ladies have any
questions for Dr. Taylor?

84
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.190
- No. not at this time.

85
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.600
Thank you so much. Dr. Taylor.

86
00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.510
- Cynthia. do you have any questions?

87
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.227
- No. I just want her to get better.

88
00:07:04.277 --> 00:07:05.373
- We all do.

89
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.880
- Thank you. thank you Dr.
Taylor I appreciate it.

90
00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:10.813
- You're welcome.

91
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.700
Ladies. I know this is a
hard time for you guys.

92
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.303
but. I want you guys to know
that she's gonna be okay.

93
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.508
- Thank you Dr. Taylor.

94
00:07:22.558 --> 00:07:23.931
- Thank you.

95
00:07:23.981 --> 00:07:25.445
- All right.

96
00:07:25.495 --> 00:07:29.760
Dr. Madison. I will contact
you in a little while. okay?

97
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:32.850
And ladies. I'll see you in the morning.

98
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.090
Okay. Thank you.

99
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:34.973
- Thank you.

100
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.960
Well. ladies there's really not much more

101
00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.573
we can do at this time but wait.

102
00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.710
And considering the circumstances.

103
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.970
more than likely we
won't have any results.

104
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.790
until tomorrow sometime.

105
00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:56.840
So my suggestion to you
is. if you like go home.

106
00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.390
get some rest. and then
come back tomorrow morning.

107
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.220
we will take good care of your mother.

108
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.547
- No. I think I'm gonna stay.

109
00:08:03.597 --> 00:08:04.950
- No sis. I'll stay.

110
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.570
Go home and get some rest okay?

111
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.170
I'll call you if anything happens.

112
00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.573
Are you sure?

113
00:08:09.623 --> 00:08:11.580
- Girl. I'm sure okay. go home.

114
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.040
I'll see you in the morning okay?

115
00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:15.910
- Okay sis. I love you so much.

116
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.310
I love you too.

117
00:08:18.227 --> 00:08:20.180
- Everything's gonna be okay.

118
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:21.430
- Natalie I'll walk you out.

119
00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.313
- Okay.

120
00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:33.533
Thank you so much.

121
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:05.783
Hello?

122
00:09:06.815 --> 00:09:10.508
Natalie.
mom's dead..

123
00:09:10.558 --> 00:09:14.720
- What. what do you mean she's dead?

124
00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:17.050
- What happened baby?

125
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.769
- It's my sister. she
said that my mom is dead.

126
00:09:20.819 --> 00:09:22.454
- Oh my. damn!

127
00:09:22.504 --> 00:09:23.396
They said that she began

128
00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.090
having trouble breathing.

129
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.100
- Where are you?

130
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.488
She was coughing real hard.

131
00:09:29.538 --> 00:09:31.455
and then she just died.

132
00:09:33.258 --> 00:09:36.527
They said that they
tried to revive her but-

133
00:09:36.577 --> 00:09:39.062
- Everything's gonna be okay.

134
00:09:39.112 --> 00:09:40.626
everything's gonna be okay. all right?

135
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:44.120
I'll be there shortly. where
are you at in the hospital?

136
00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:46.210
No. I'm not in there.

137
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.496
I'm in the emergency room's parking lot.

138
00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:51.285
there are just so many people in there.

139
00:09:51.309 --> 00:09:54.342
- Okay sis listen. I'm
gonna be there shortly okay?

140
00:09:54.392 --> 00:09:56.791
Everything's gonna be okay.
I'll be there shortly.

141
00:09:56.841 --> 00:09:57.890
I love you.

142
00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.080
.

143
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.569
- We gotta go. we gotta go.

144
00:10:03.619 --> 00:10:06.506
- I'm sorry honey. let's go honey.

145
00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:16.401
Honey it's okay. it's
okay. we're gonna be okay.

146
00:10:34.975 --> 00:10:38.058
I gotta get dressed okay?

147
00:10:41.857 --> 00:10:43.996
I've
had enough tragedy in my life.

148
00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:47.430
for a few lifetimes. so this news.

149
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.900
was definitely something
I didn't wanna hear.

150
00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:55.143
My mom was just sick
yesterday. and now she's dead?

151
00:11:16.481 --> 00:11:18.240
- Yeah this is puzzling to all of us.

152
00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:19.331
What happened.

153
00:11:19.381 --> 00:11:21.610
you told us that she was doing okay.

154
00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.304
- For heavens I had no idea
what's going on with this virus.

155
00:11:24.354 --> 00:11:26.198
and now it's growing so badly.

156
00:11:26.248 --> 00:11:27.198
Sis?

157
00:11:27.248 --> 00:11:28.459
Natalie I'm
so glad you're here.

158
00:11:28.483 --> 00:11:30.413
Are you okay?

159
00:11:30.463 --> 00:11:32.713
No. she's dead.

160
00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:35.436
I went looking
for you in the parking lot.

161
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.369
they told me you were here.

162
00:11:36.393 --> 00:11:37.927
- They brought me back here.

163
00:11:37.977 --> 00:11:41.400
- This is my husband. Alvin.

164
00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.386
Alvin. this is Dr. Taylor.

165
00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:44.377
- Nice to meet you.

166
00:11:44.427 --> 00:11:45.846
- Nice to meet you too.

167
00:11:45.896 --> 00:11:47.710
- So. tell me what happened.

168
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.960
I thought you said she
was going to be okay.

169
00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:54.020
- I did. I truly thought she would be.

170
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.560
Her respiratory system just shut down and.

171
00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:00.173
there was nothing we
could do. I'm so sorry.

172
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.120
- Look. I know it's not your fault.

173
00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:06.830
I know that you guys did
everything that you possibly could.

174
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.233
- We did Natalie.

175
00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:10.728
But in our line of work.

176
00:12:10.778 --> 00:12:13.023
sometimes all that we
can do just isn't enough.

177
00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:16.530
- Well. when can we see her?

178
00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.270
Where is she right now?

179
00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.394
- I'm afraid that won't be possible.

180
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.960
- What do you mean you're afraid not?

181
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:26.310
- With the possibility
that your mother's death.

182
00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.490
was COVID-19 related.

183
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.510
protocol does not allow you to access her.

184
00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.460
Families who have lost
loved ones due to COVID-19.

185
00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:37.050
are not allowed to access them either.

186
00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.190
that includes your mother.

187
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.248
- You know what.

188
00:12:40.298 --> 00:12:42.580
I don't give a damn about
nobody else's family okay?

189
00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.485
- Calm down.
- No. let me go.

190
00:12:44.535 --> 00:12:46.770
You just said people with COVID-19.

191
00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:48.703
Well you never told us that she had it.

192
00:12:48.753 --> 00:12:50.480
As a matter of fact.
you said it last night.

193
00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:53.520
and just a few minutes ago.
never got the test back.

194
00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:55.186
So what the hell was she
even doing back there.

195
00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:56.395
with people that had that shit?

196
00:12:56.419 --> 00:12:58.927
- Whoa whoa whoa sis. come on. come on.

197
00:12:58.977 --> 00:12:59.827
don't worry about it.

198
00:12:59.877 --> 00:13:01.153
We're definitely gonna
get to the bottom of this.

199
00:13:01.177 --> 00:13:04.168
- Oh yeah definitely. gonna
get to the bottom of this.

200
00:13:04.218 --> 00:13:06.348
Let me asked you something Dr. Taylor.

201
00:13:06.398 --> 00:13:09.310
what happened to our mother.
why can't we go see her?

202
00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.990
- I'm sorry. but the
hospital is only following.

203
00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.960
CDC protocol.

204
00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:16.146
- This is some real bullshit right now.

205
00:13:16.196 --> 00:13:18.590
Everybody just calm down.

206
00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.833
- You know what ladies and gentlemen.

207
00:13:21.876 --> 00:13:23.943
I think it's time that you leave.

208
00:13:23.993 --> 00:13:27.000
- Leave. you know what. fuck
you and fuck this hospital.

209
00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:28.460
I'm gonna go see my mother okay?

210
00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:29.730
- Yes.

211
00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:31.826
Security to
conference room one please?

212
00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:34.260
- Look as much as we
understand you're upset.

213
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:35.993
we feel remorse for you as well okay?

214
00:13:36.043 --> 00:13:37.537
But you have to understand.

215
00:13:37.587 --> 00:13:40.280
and you have to follow the
guidelines of this hospital.

216
00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.070
Do you understand me?

217
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.460
- So our mom's dead.

218
00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:45.920
and that's just supposed to be it right?

219
00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:48.870
- Look. you don't realize we
go through this every day.

220
00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.510
Our hearts go out to you. but
you must conduct yourself.

221
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.490
in an according manner.
security is on their way here.

222
00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.243
- We just wanna see her okay?

223
00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.510
- We have every right to see our mother.

224
00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:02.826
- I wish we could do that for you.

225
00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:06.040
we can not allow you to see
your mother unfortunately.

226
00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:07.040
- This is bullshit.

227
00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:08.477
- Yes. this is some bullshit.

228
00:14:08.527 --> 00:14:09.900
- Bunch of crap.

229
00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:13.980
- Look. we did our best to
keep your mother alive okay?

230
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:15.650
And that's all we can do. is our best.

231
00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:17.103
We can not guarantee you.

232
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.210
- And that's why she's dead now right.

233
00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.710
and we can't see her. is
that what you're telling us?

234
00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.340
- That's all we want.
we want to see her okay?

235
00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:28.800
- That is a policy. we did
not make those guidelines.

236
00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:29.900
- This is bullshit.

237
00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:31.008
- Bunch of crap.

238
00:14:31.058 --> 00:14:32.050
- This is ridiculous.

239
00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.850
- I'm gonna need you to understand us.

240
00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:34.858
Just like we're trying

241
00:14:34.908 --> 00:14:37.060
to understand your situation right now.

242
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:38.085
- Really?

243
00:14:38.135 --> 00:14:39.736
- Well. it wasn't your
mother that died was it?

244
00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.600
- Look. we can talk about this later on.

245
00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:44.380
right now. we're gonna need
you to exit the facility.

246
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:47.160
- We ain’t exiting nowhere.
unless we're gonna see my mother.

247
00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:49.450
- Okay. when security comes in.

248
00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.500
we're gonna have you
walk out with them. okay?

249
00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:52.391
Come on now.

250
00:14:52.441 --> 00:14:53.319
- Security ain’t nothing.

251
00:14:53.343 --> 00:14:54.483
- Look. we're just trying to get you

252
00:14:54.507 --> 00:14:56.574
to understand the hospital policies okay?

253
00:14:56.624 --> 00:14:57.616
- All right. all right.

254
00:14:57.666 --> 00:15:00.171
- Hospital policies. our mom is gone.

255
00:15:00.221 --> 00:15:02.644
- That's enough let's go. let's go.

256
00:15:02.694 --> 00:15:04.511
- Don't touch me. don't touch me.

257
00:15:04.561 --> 00:15:06.323
- Either you go or you're going to jail.

258
00:15:06.373 --> 00:15:10.871
Either you go or you're
going to jail. let's go.

259
00:15:10.921 --> 00:15:11.865
- This is ridiculous.

260
00:15:11.915 --> 00:15:12.865
Time to go.

261
00:15:12.915 --> 00:15:13.904
- Yeah.

262
00:15:13.954 --> 00:15:15.261
Can't Believe this!

263
00:15:30.773 --> 00:15:34.030
- You know sis. with all this
stuff going on right now.

264
00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.590
I think it's best that we get an attorney.

265
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.550
- I agree sister.

266
00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.076
- I mean. I'm thinking of going over.

267
00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.863
and talking to one of my friends.

268
00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.420
Because this is personal you
know. and I want someone that.

269
00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:49.670
can actually defend us the right way.

270
00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.620
- Exactly. I agree. let's do it.

271
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:56.310
- Okay. well I think I'll
probably give her a call tomorrow.

272
00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.006
and see if I can go over there.

273
00:15:58.056 --> 00:15:58.978
- Okay.

274
00:15:59.028 --> 00:16:04.028
- I just can't believe
that.  mom's gone.

275
00:16:05.641 --> 00:16:06.488
- I know. I know.

276
00:16:08.095 --> 00:16:09.960
I know sister. I know.

277
00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:11.560
- I keep repeating in my head.

278
00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:14.649
when you called me and told
me that she's dead. it just...

279
00:16:17.753 --> 00:16:18.811
I'm sorry.

280
00:16:18.861 --> 00:16:21.483
- It's okay sister. we'll get
to the bottom of this okay?

281
00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.353
- Hey. that's Daniella
put your mask on guys.

282
00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:48.970
- Hey friend. how are you doing?

283
00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:50.705
- Hey girl. how are you?

284
00:16:50.755 --> 00:16:51.807
- I'm okay.

285
00:16:51.857 --> 00:16:53.840
- I'm sorry. I brought you something.

286
00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:56.250
- Oh. thank you so much. I appreciate it.

287
00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.029
- Hey sister?

288
00:16:58.079 --> 00:16:59.029
Hey girl.

289
00:16:59.079 --> 00:17:00.428
- How are you?

290
00:17:00.478 --> 00:17:01.991
Oh you know.
just hanging in there.

291
00:17:02.015 --> 00:17:03.163
- Hey. what's up girl?

292
00:17:03.213 --> 00:17:04.118
Hey bro.

293
00:17:04.168 --> 00:17:05.440
- How are you doing?

294
00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:08.040
- Oh. almost good. but
I believe what I heard?

295
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:10.570
- Yeah it is what it is.
hey you want some coffee?

296
00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:11.546
I really do.

297
00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:13.733
and I need a lot of
sugar. and a lot of cream.

298
00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.272
Thank you. bro.

299
00:17:17.322 --> 00:17:19.180
- Anytime girlfriend.

300
00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:20.980
I'm not gonna let this slide.

301
00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:22.725
And you shouldn't.

302
00:17:22.775 --> 00:17:25.221
- Honey I'm gonna go to the
store and grab some things.

303
00:17:25.271 --> 00:17:26.704
Want to give you ladies some time to talk.

304
00:17:26.728 --> 00:17:27.965
- Okay babe. love you.

305
00:17:28.015 --> 00:17:29.305
- Love you too.

306
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:31.126
- All right. you be careful okay?

307
00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:32.016
- I will.

308
00:17:32.066 --> 00:17:33.366
- Hey. can you get some hand sanitizer.

309
00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:34.249
while you're out please?

310
00:17:34.273 --> 00:17:35.106
- Oh. sure will.

311
00:17:35.156 --> 00:17:36.246
- Thank you babe.

312
00:17:36.296 --> 00:17:37.313
- I'll leave you Ladies to it.

313
00:17:37.337 --> 00:17:39.102
love you. I'll be right back.

314
00:17:39.152 --> 00:17:40.168
- Thank you.
- Thank you bro.

315
00:17:40.192 --> 00:17:41.096

316
00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.023
Oh. I got you.

317
00:17:43.073 --> 00:17:44.190
Drive safe.

318
00:17:45.157 --> 00:17:46.491
I will.

319
00:17:48.393 --> 00:17:50.924
- I love a man that goes
out and gets stuff for you.

320
00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:02.650
- Hey pastor. how are you doing?

321
00:18:02.674 --> 00:18:04.140
- Brother Alvin. how are you?

322
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:05.350
It's good to see you though.

323
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.414
Sorry for the loss of your mother-in-law.

324
00:18:08.464 --> 00:18:11.003
that's right.

325
00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:14.600
Yeah. how are you doing?

326
00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:16.390
- I'm doing great. thank you pastor.

327
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.770
- That's good. and how
are the girls doing?

328
00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:21.210
- Not so good. but I'm
glad that you're here.

329
00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.010
- Well. I'm glad to be here.

330
00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.360
you know I love the family so...

331
00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:25.243
- Come on in.

332
00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.800
- Ladies. we got some company.

333
00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.610
Hey pastor. how are you?

334
00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:33.736
Let me get your coat for you.

335
00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:34.820
- Natalie. how are you?

336
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:37.110
- I'm doing good. thank you so very much.

337
00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.720
- My condolences to you
and your family members.

338
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:41.550
- Yes. thank you.

339
00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.500
- If there is anything.

340
00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:46.130
and I mean anything that you guys need.

341
00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:51.180
from myself or the church.
don't hesitate to ask okay?

342
00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.008
- Thank you pastor. how
is the first lady doing?

343
00:18:54.058 --> 00:18:55.247
- She's doing okay.

344
00:18:55.297 --> 00:18:58.655
I guess. she was pretty devastated.

345
00:18:58.705 --> 00:19:00.790
when she got the news about your mother.

346
00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:05.300
So. it's been pretty hurtful right now.

347
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:06.269
But she's getting through it.

348
00:19:06.293 --> 00:19:08.390
they was just together last week.

349
00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:11.230
preparing for the church's anniversary.

350
00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:15.060
- I know this happened all
of a sudden and I just...

351
00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:19.201
I don't know what I'm
gonna do without my mom.

352
00:19:20.545 --> 00:19:22.920
- Well. one thing is for sure.

353
00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:26.450
that a sister Carrie. she
raised some strong daughters.

354
00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:27.623
and you will be fine.

355
00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:30.140
- You're right about that pastor.

356
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:34.160
- Okay. can I get you
something to drink pastor.

357
00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:36.260
would you like coffee. water. tea?

358
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:38.120
- Water would be just fine.

359
00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:39.105
- Okay.

360
00:19:39.155 --> 00:19:40.489
- Thank you. sister.

361
00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:48.715
Is it okay if I asked you.

362
00:19:48.765 --> 00:19:51.240
what happened to your mother exactly.

363
00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:55.187
'cause. just last Sunday
she was at the church.

364
00:19:55.237 --> 00:19:59.200
and she was healthy and doing
fine and as a matter of fact.

365
00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:01.150
she was just talking

366
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.620
about making her world
famous mac and cheese.

367
00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:06.120
for the church's anniversary.

368
00:20:07.462 --> 00:20:11.710
- Well pastor. I mean. she was
fine up until two days ago.

369
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.160
But then she started complaining

370
00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:14.560
about having a scratchy throat.

371
00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:15.934
and she thought that she was coming down

372
00:20:15.958 --> 00:20:17.822
with a cold or something.

373
00:20:17.872 --> 00:20:20.082
but then last night. I woke up to her.

374
00:20:20.132 --> 00:20:21.890
coughing uncontrollably.

375
00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:23.782
She was having trouble breathing.

376
00:20:23.832 --> 00:20:26.423
So I called an ambulance.
and took her to the hospital.

377
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.445
- Did they say it was COVID-19?

378
00:20:29.495 --> 00:20:31.820
- Well. not exactly.

379
00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:34.660
They didn't say anything. they just...

380
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:37.460
I mean. we're just waiting
for the test results.

381
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:40.340
and then all of a sudden she just died.

382
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:44.423
- Wow. I'm so sorry
ladies. this is tragic.

383
00:20:45.539 --> 00:20:47.950
So where is she right now?

384
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.900
- She's still in that hospital.

385
00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:53.940
They didn't let us see her.
get her things. nothing.

386
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:55.660
- Hmm. that's shameful

387
00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:59.180
because this is happening
all across the nation.

388
00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:02.772
And this COVID thing.
something wrong about this.

389
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:06.970
- You know. one of my
friends lost their brother.

390
00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.700
to this COVID mess.

391
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:12.350
And they told her family. that
they couldn't get his body.

392
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.450
And my thing is. with
all these people dying.

393
00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:18.950
what are they doing
with the bodies anyway?

394
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.600
- No one knows.

395
00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:23.190
This government of ours is...

396
00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.040
They're not gonna tell us either way.

397
00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:26.980
what's happening with our people.

398
00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:28.520
and this is ridiculous.

399
00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:31.443
the numbers are in the
hundreds and thousands.

400
00:21:31.493 --> 00:21:33.560
And these people are
losing their loved ones.

401
00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:36.237
and they're just simply telling
them from the hospitals.

402
00:21:36.287 --> 00:21:37.553
"Just go home."

403
00:21:37.603 --> 00:21:39.054
- Right pastor.

404
00:21:39.104 --> 00:21:40.078
- You're right pastor.

405
00:21:40.128 --> 00:21:41.266
- That's what the lady told us.

406
00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:44.120
You can't see her. you
can get her body. get out.

407
00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:45.003
- Yeah.

408
00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.450
- That's shameful.

409
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:51.090
- Look. all I know is that
I want my mother's body.

410
00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:53.663
so that we can lay her
to rest the right way.

411
00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:57.780
- Sister Natalie. I want you to know.

412
00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:00.640
that that we're gonna do everything

413
00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:03.232
in our power to get sister Curry.

414
00:22:03.282 --> 00:22:07.480
It's just ridiculous. we have to get her.

415
00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:11.590
and we are going to give
her the best Memorial.

416
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.110
this church can give her.

417
00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:17.310
We're gonna celebrate her
life. because she gave life.

418
00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.210
- Yes.

419
00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:19.760
- And that's what we're gonna do.

420
00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:22.660
- Thank you pastor. we
really appreciate that.

421
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:25.099
- Absolutely. absolutely.

422
00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:29.180
- You know. what's even weirder to me.

423
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:31.640
again with all of these people dying.

424
00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:33.933
what are they doing
with the bodies pastor?

425
00:22:36.819 --> 00:22:39.270
- That's something that we just don't know

426
00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:42.230
what they're doing with
their bodies and it's crazy.

427
00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.566
But we're gonna have to figure it out

428
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:46.090
because. for you not to be able to go.

429
00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.570
and pick up your loved one
and bury your loved one.

430
00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:50.980
it's just plain cruel.

431
00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:54.536
- And that's exactly what
it is pastor. cruelty.

432
00:22:54.586 --> 00:22:56.630
- Yes it is.

433
00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.660
- Something has to be done about this.

434
00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:59.718
- I agree with you.

435
00:22:59.768 --> 00:23:02.130
And that's why I'm going
to go and see an attorney.

436
00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:05.260
and make sure that this
is handled correctly.

437
00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:07.375
- Yes. yes. yes indeed.

438
00:23:09.065 --> 00:23:09.923
- Thank you.

439
00:23:09.973 --> 00:23:11.066
- And we gotta say prayer for her.

440
00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:13.512
and just remember the
church has your back.

441
00:23:13.562 --> 00:23:15.904
All right. we're a phone call away.

442
00:23:15.954 --> 00:23:17.396
Thank you. pastor.

443
00:23:17.446 --> 00:23:20.290
- Thank you. it's been
a blessing to see y'all.

444
00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.980
and I'm praying for y'all strength.

445
00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:26.172
I'm praying for the entire
family. and don't forget.

446
00:23:26.222 --> 00:23:29.290
we're gonna send sister Curry away.

447
00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:32.760
in the best way possible.

448
00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:33.693
Yes.

449
00:23:33.743 --> 00:23:34.840
- God bless you. I'm gonna take off now.

450
00:23:34.864 --> 00:23:36.851
- God bless you too pastor.

451
00:23:36.901 --> 00:23:39.984
- You know my wife is waiting for me.

452
00:23:41.417 --> 00:23:42.266
Thank you sister.

453
00:23:43.241 --> 00:23:44.530
- Here you go pastor.

454
00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:46.013
- Take care pastor.

455
00:23:46.063 --> 00:23:47.641
- Thank you and God bless you ladies.

456
00:23:47.691 --> 00:23:48.730
- God bless you too.

457
00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:53.860
- Thank you for coming
we really appreciate it.

458
00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:55.183
- Okay. y'all be safe.

459
00:23:55.233 --> 00:23:57.229
and remember to wear your face mask okay?

460
00:23:57.279 --> 00:23:58.096
Yes.

461
00:23:58.146 --> 00:23:59.054
- All right.

462
00:23:59.104 --> 00:24:00.163
God bless you pastor.

463
00:24:00.187 --> 00:24:01.984
God bless you.

464
00:24:03.975 --> 00:24:06.463
Wow. I'm really glad
that he came by today.

465
00:24:07.417 --> 00:24:08.890
- I know sister.

466
00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:12.693
- That really helped me a
lot. that he was here with us.

467
00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:17.880
and prayed for us. I feel
a lot better how about you?

468
00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:20.000
- Me too sister. I mean I still miss mom.

469
00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:21.350
.

470
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:38.763
- Hey honey. how did it go
with pastor and the ladies?

471
00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:43.813
- It went well. it was nice
that pastor came by you know.

472
00:24:44.727 --> 00:24:47.863
- Are you okay. you
look like you're upset.

473
00:24:49.147 --> 00:24:53.163
- No. I'm not upset. it's
just that I feel like.

474
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.720
right here something's not okay.

475
00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:59.080
- Honey. I know why you feel this way.

476
00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:03.960
Look. let's call it a day.
let's go to bed and snuggle.

477
00:25:05.843 --> 00:25:07.554
and we can talk some more there.

478
00:25:07.604 --> 00:25:10.110
- Okay. well I have to
clean up these dishes first.

479
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:10.993
- Okay sweetie.

480
00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:14.083
Look. it's gonna be okay. okay?

481
00:25:15.012 --> 00:25:16.016
- Okay.

482
00:25:17.136 --> 00:25:18.119
Thank you baby.

483
00:25:52.517 --> 00:25:54.550
- Babe. a lot has happened.

484
00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:58.530
And you and your mom always
had a special connection.

485
00:25:58.580 --> 00:25:59.643
almost intuitive.

486
00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:04.313
- I know. but baby it's
like I feel it right here.

487
00:26:04.363 --> 00:26:06.550
like she's talking to me.

488
00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:09.851
I know it sounds strange.
but that's how I feel.

489
00:26:09.901 --> 00:26:12.377
- Baby I know. let's just close our eyes.

490
00:26:12.427 --> 00:26:14.323
and just call it a night. okay?

491
00:26:15.206 --> 00:26:16.039
- Okay.

492
00:26:17.463 --> 00:26:18.380
- I love you.

493
00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:19.404
- I love you too.

494
00:27:45.458 --> 00:27:47.913
Mom is that you?

495
00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:53.927
- Yeah it's me. it is me.

496
00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:59.960
- But mom. they told us
that you didn't make it.

497
00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:06.797
- I'm still here with you
baby .

498
00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:11.860
- No mom. the doctor told
us that you were dead.

499
00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:13.447
and you stopped breathing.

500
00:28:14.723 --> 00:28:18.267
- I never stopped breathing.

501
00:28:19.834 --> 00:28:24.169
- No. no. they told us that you were dead.

502
00:28:24.219 --> 00:28:26.604
- We are not dead

503
00:28:26.654 --> 00:28:30.321
there was a lot of us
still breathing there.

504
00:28:31.704 --> 00:28:34.894
.

505
00:28:46.959 --> 00:28:48.209
- Coffee honey?

506
00:28:49.289 --> 00:28:51.807
- No thank you.

507
00:28:54.781 --> 00:28:57.270
- Are you okay. you've
been moaning and talking

508
00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.710
in your sleep.

509
00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:01.793
- Baby. I just had the
craziest dream about my mom.

510
00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:06.520
- Look you need some rest
babe. I know this is hard.

511
00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:08.660
but our family is strong.

512
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:10.550
and we're gonna make it through this.

513
00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:13.540
I'm gonna go to work. and
I'll be back in a few hours.

514
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:14.580
- Okay.

515
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:17.366
- So. I'll be back to make you dinner.

516
00:29:17.416 --> 00:29:18.850
- Shrimp fettuccine?

517
00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:21.420
- Shrimp fettuccine it is my love.

518
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:25.750
- Okay. I don't know what I
would do without you baby.

519
00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.649
- That's why I'm here honey.

520
00:29:28.715 --> 00:29:32.158
Now. you go get some rest
and I'll be back early okay?

521
00:29:32.208 --> 00:29:33.126
- Yeah.

522
00:29:33.176 --> 00:29:34.101
- All right baby.

523
00:29:35.095 --> 00:29:36.036
- All right I love you.

524
00:29:36.086 --> 00:29:37.074
- I love you too.

525
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:58.840
- Hello?

526
00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:01.150
- Hey D. how you doing girl?

527
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.583
- Hey girl. how are you?

528
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.113
- I don't know. I'm just
so confused right now.

529
00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:13.970
I just had like the
craziest dream about my mom.

530
00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:16.430
- Are you okay. what do you need me to do?

531
00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:19.969
- Yeah. I'm okay.

532
00:30:20.019 --> 00:30:22.680
I mean no. I'm not okay.
this is all a nightmare.

533
00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:24.620
- I know. I feel so sorry for you.

534
00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:26.751
is there anything that I can do?

535
00:30:28.453 --> 00:30:29.362
My mom once taught me

536
00:30:29.386 --> 00:30:30.840
the meaning of dreams.

537
00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:32.685
She would always say to me meha.

538
00:30:32.735 --> 00:30:34.740
your dreams show you your future.

539
00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:36.800
and the more you control your dreams.

540
00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:39.050
the more control you
will have in your life.

541
00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:42.920
Well if that was the case.
I was out of control.

542
00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:45.377
and needed friends and family.

543
00:31:53.209 --> 00:31:54.793
- Hey sis how are you?

544
00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:58.707
Yeah I can't believe
that this is happening.

545
00:31:58.757 --> 00:32:00.050
- Me either sis.

546
00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:03.210
I haven't been able to stay
at the house since that night.

547
00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:04.920
I came home the next morning.

548
00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:06.186
till straighten up a little bit.

549
00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:09.290
but I just found myself
walking from mom's room crying.

550
00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:10.470
I had to get out of there.

551
00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:12.060
- So where have you been?

552
00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:14.210
- I stayed over a Marcus's place.

553
00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:17.840
- Now sis. you do know that
you can come and stay with us.

554
00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:19.140
You're more than welcome.

555
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.600
- I know. I know.

556
00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:23.360
I just needed to clear my head.

557
00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:24.990
I'm gonna go back to the house today.

558
00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:27.100
to get things situated.

559
00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:29.020
You know. when me and
mom moved in together.

560
00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:31.900
she had a lot of stuff.
I mean a lot of stuff.

561
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:34.273
And since then. she bought even more.

562
00:32:34.323 --> 00:32:36.333
- Girl you know your mama loved to shop.

563
00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:40.970
Yeah. I'm over here
looking at pictures of us.

564
00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:46.020
and you me and mom. we were
"The Three Musketeers".

565
00:32:47.463 --> 00:32:50.996
- I know right. I can't believe
how crazy all of this is.

566
00:32:51.046 --> 00:32:52.510
And what really gets to me.

567
00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.230
is that they won't give us her body.

568
00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:57.110
so that at least we can give
her a proper Christian funeral.

569
00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.928
That's what she would've wanted.

570
00:32:58.978 --> 00:33:02.090
- You know. this virus
has changed everything.

571
00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:04.156
and even the world that we live in.

572
00:33:04.206 --> 00:33:07.633
I've heard that there's been
people and families like us.

573
00:33:07.683 --> 00:33:10.500
where their loved ones have
gone into the hospital.

574
00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:13.720
and they've never seen them after that.

575
00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:15.580
- Wow. this is crazy.

576
00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:17.280
Someone needs to end this virus.

577
00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:18.720
before all of us end up dead.

578
00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:21.530
- Sis. they haven't
trying to end anything.

579
00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:26.580
because you know what war
sells. and this is war.

580
00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:28.560
I just want them to release her body.

581
00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:31.170
so that we can give her proper burial.

582
00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:32.850
- Exactly. and you would think

583
00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:34.870
that since she's our family member.

584
00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.350
we should have that right.

585
00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:39.970
- Amen. girl. let me get off this phone.

586
00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:43.150
Are you still coming over for
a dinner and a movie tonight?

587
00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.200
- Yeah. I'm gonna try to make it.

588
00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:47.100
- Try. girl don't even try that.

589
00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:48.476
We're supposed to talk about mom's

590
00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.270
memorial service remember?

591
00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.820
- Okay. okay. I'll be there.

592
00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:53.100
- Okay. six O'clock?

593
00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:54.133
- See you at six sis.

594
00:33:54.183 --> 00:33:56.030
- All right see you then. love you.

595
00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.702
- Bye. love you.

596
00:33:57.752 --> 00:34:00.713
that girl.

597
00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:07.543
Oh my God. I am so tired.

598
00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:09.962
I just need to get...

599
00:34:10.012 --> 00:34:11.445
I'm gonna take five minutes.

600
00:34:12.541 --> 00:34:15.216
I'm just gonna rest my
eyes .

601
00:36:04.766 --> 00:36:06.449
Who are you?

602
00:36:44.121 --> 00:36:45.505
- Babe what's wrong?

603
00:36:48.082 --> 00:36:48.999
I don't know.

604
00:36:49.023 --> 00:36:50.147
- It's okay.

605
00:36:53.793 --> 00:36:55.316
My
dreams were getting worse.

606
00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:58.430
it's one thing to have a dream about mom.

607
00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.280
but who were these other people.

608
00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:02.755
and why were they torturing me?

609
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:06.860
Enough is enough. I needed
to get some legal help.

610
00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:08.763
to find out what happened to my mom.

611
00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:13.271
Something just wasn't
right about this situation.

612
00:37:27.247 --> 00:37:28.330
- Oh. Natalie!

613
00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:30.330
- Hi. how are you?
- It's good to see you.

614
00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:31.530
- It's good to see you.

615
00:37:32.422 --> 00:37:34.302
- I'm sorry about your mother.

616
00:37:38.184 --> 00:37:42.380
Go ahead and have a seat. get comfortable.

617
00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:43.888
So how's Alvin?

618
00:37:43.938 --> 00:37:47.425
- Alvin is doing fine.
he's such a great husband.

619
00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:50.156
he's been supporting us
through this whole thing.

620
00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:52.020
but. girl let me tell you.

621
00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:54.895
there's times when he starts
acting like a big baby though.

622
00:37:55.953 --> 00:37:58.550
- I hear you. 'cause
Thomas and them twins.

623
00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:01.210
they drive me crazy every day.

624
00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:02.552
- Wow girl you have twins.

625
00:38:02.602 --> 00:38:05.690
I will be pulling my
hair out if I had twins.

626
00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:09.050
- I'm definitely there.
I am definitely there.

627
00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:12.723
So. tell me about your
mom and this hospital.

628
00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:15.190
Well.

629
00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:19.280
I got a call the other night
from my sister Cynthia.

630
00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:21.677
and she said that my mom
was in the ambulance.

631
00:38:21.727 --> 00:38:24.560
and they were taking her to the hospital.

632
00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:26.810
So. when I get to the hospital.

633
00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:29.047
my mom is in the emergency room.

634
00:38:29.097 --> 00:38:31.860
and they're treating her
for shortness of breath.

635
00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:34.760
Dr. Madison was there. and Dr. Taylor.

636
00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:37.230
the respiratory specialist was there.

637
00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.570
Dr. Taylor said that
my mom was displaying.

638
00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:41.270
signs of COVID-19.

639
00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:44.610
but they couldn't officially diagnose her.

640
00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:47.035
until the test results came back.

641
00:38:47.085 --> 00:38:51.369
- So they basically was
following COVID-19 procedures.

642
00:38:51.419 --> 00:38:54.160
- Yeah. basically.

643
00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:56.880
they said that there was really
nothing that they could do.

644
00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:59.968
except make her comfortable.
and regulate her breathing.

645
00:39:00.018 --> 00:39:01.460
So here I was.

646
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:03.494
going to my lawyer to
see if she could help.

647
00:39:03.544 --> 00:39:06.470
and all she did was take some notes.

648
00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:10.440
Like really. I don't need
some BS empathy parade.

649
00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:13.300
followed with the life story documentary.

650
00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:15.570
I just wanted to see my mom.

651
00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:18.240
and all these people wanna
do is write paperwork.

652
00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:20.030
that'll go in their endless drawers.

653
00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:21.543
with their endless clients.

654
00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:24.740
It just makes me wanna scream.

655
00:39:33.002 --> 00:39:37.585
- Well that was good. I'm
about to pass out after that.

656
00:39:42.103 --> 00:39:43.696
- I know you ain't
calling my chicken rigate.

657
00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:45.743
you were hitting it pretty
good yourself there.

658
00:39:45.793 --> 00:39:47.427
Hey. y'all just fat. amigos.

659
00:39:47.477 --> 00:39:49.900
- Hey. there ain’t no fat over here.

660
00:39:51.136 --> 00:39:53.466
- Okay. if that's what you say baby.

661
00:39:53.516 --> 00:39:54.886
- There is no fat over here either.

662
00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:56.860
this is pure sexiness sister.

663
00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:59.645
I know
that's sexiness for sure.

664
00:40:01.118 --> 00:40:02.756
So I
tried to pick up the pieces

665
00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:05.179
of my life. I was sick of this.

666
00:40:05.229 --> 00:40:08.160
And wondering what happened to my mom.

667
00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:13.210
nobody had answers. and that
type of confusion is maddening.

668
00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:17.250
I think it was playing tricks on my mind.

669
00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:23.320
Family. was definitely
my only sense of peace.

670
00:40:29.854 --> 00:40:30.934
- Give me that remote sis.

671
00:40:30.984 --> 00:40:32.017
- Hey!

672
00:40:34.853 --> 00:40:37.530
- Man. I do not know why
we pay for this service.

673
00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:40.870
there's never nothing on this crap.

674
00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:44.106
- That's what I say every
time I pay the bill baby.

675
00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:52.227
- Honey. are you okay?

676
00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.333
- Yeah. yeah I'm fine.

677
00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:57.529
- Come on. let's go sit down.

678
00:40:57.579 --> 00:40:59.446
I'll whip up dishes later.
I'll take care of dishes.

679
00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:03.096
- All right well let me
close these blinds first.

680
00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:07.830
Come on. sis.

681
00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:13.298
Nothing.

682
00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:22.470
- Hey. there's a woman out
there that looks like my mom.

683
00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:24.200
- What you mean she looks like your mom?

684
00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:26.001
- She's right there.

685
00:41:26.051 --> 00:41:28.567
- Where?

686
00:41:28.617 --> 00:41:30.618
- She was standing right there.

687
00:41:30.668 --> 00:41:31.501
- Where?

688
00:41:33.091 --> 00:41:34.890
- She was standing right there.

689
00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:37.050
- This isn't funny. don't
even play like that.

690
00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:38.793
- I don't see any woman out there Nat-

691
00:41:38.843 --> 00:41:41.295
- I know what I saw she
was standing right there.

692
00:41:41.345 --> 00:41:42.625
- Come on. come on.

693
00:41:42.675 --> 00:41:43.634
- There's nobody out there.

694
00:41:43.658 --> 00:41:46.170
- Come on. let's sit
down. you're stressed out.

695
00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:47.983
- Look. I'm not stressed out.

696
00:41:49.189 --> 00:41:52.987
Okay. a little stressed
out. but I know what I saw.

697
00:41:53.037 --> 00:41:55.165
.

698
00:41:55.215 --> 00:41:56.538
- Oh. you are stressed out.

699
00:41:56.588 --> 00:41:58.660
- It's okay sister. it's okay.

700
00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:01.140
I know we're going through a
lot. and everyone's on edge.

701
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:02.728
but just...

702
00:42:02.778 --> 00:42:03.818
- But she was right there.

703
00:42:05.808 --> 00:42:09.708
- You're just stressed out. come on baby.

704
00:42:09.758 --> 00:42:11.793
you'll be fine baby. you're gonna be good.

705
00:42:34.197 --> 00:42:37.090
- Hello sisters. how are you doing today?

706
00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:38.129
We're fine.

707
00:42:38.179 --> 00:42:39.960
- How are you doing pastor?

708
00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:42.070
- Well. I'm doing well.
all things considered.

709
00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:44.393
that's going on today in the world.

710
00:42:44.443 --> 00:42:47.150
- Hmm. I know that's right.
with this coronavirus.

711
00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:49.490
and all the unrest in the world right now.

712
00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:52.294
it is a little overwhelming.

713
00:42:52.344 --> 00:42:55.740
- Yes. and that's why we
must protect ourselves.

714
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:59.190
by wearing our mask by washing
and sanitizing our hands.

715
00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:04.240
and by doing our number
one defense. is prayer.

716
00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:08.140
- Yes pastor. with what
happened to my mother.

717
00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:11.340
has definitely had me praying
really hard for everyone.

718
00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:13.560
- Amen sister. amen.

719
00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:18.470
- You know. the fact that we
can't get our mom's body back.

720
00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:23.437
it's really tearing at
me. and I have dreams.

721
00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:28.083
and I feel like she's
trying to tell me something.

722
00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:31.197
and it's gotten to the
point now where it's like.

723
00:43:31.247 --> 00:43:33.164
I think I see her.

724
00:43:34.997 --> 00:43:37.740
- I understand how this can happen.

725
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:41.200
Sometimes our subconscious
is negatively affected.

726
00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:43.760
that our brain begins to fight back.

727
00:43:43.810 --> 00:43:47.643
There are so many families
that this has happened to.

728
00:43:49.057 --> 00:43:52.743
It's just mind boggling
and I don't understand.

729
00:43:52.793 --> 00:43:56.390
how these people will not allow you.

730
00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.930
to see your family members.

731
00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:01.250
And they don't allow you
to see your family members.

732
00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:02.673
and it's not right.

733
00:44:03.966 --> 00:44:05.766
- Absolutely pastor.

734
00:44:05.816 --> 00:44:07.088
- Yes. yes. yes.

735
00:44:07.138 --> 00:44:10.120
But one thing is about it.
we will not allow them.

736
00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:13.652
to stop us from celebrating
the life of sister Carrie.

737
00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:18.770
She was a great mother. church member.

738
00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:20.890
and most of all a friend.

739
00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:22.650
- Thank you pastor.
- Thank you.

740
00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:26.150
- No. there's no need for
thanks she was one of our own.

741
00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:28.750
And if you don't mind.
you can pray with me.

742
00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.500
and we can pray for sister Carrie.

743
00:44:32.547 --> 00:44:34.043
- Uh. COVID?

744
00:44:34.093 --> 00:44:36.500
- That's right COVID. bow your heads.

745
00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:41.550
Dear father God we thank you.
for the life of sister Curry.

746
00:44:42.572 --> 00:44:46.070
God we thank you for the
seeds that she's planted.

747
00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:48.479
God we thank you for her daughters.

748
00:44:48.529 --> 00:44:50.250
and her family and friends.

749
00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:53.537
They may not understand your purpose.

750
00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:57.700
They may not understand your will.

751
00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:01.433
but God your will must
be done in our lives.

752
00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:05.000
We thank you. we thank you for her life.

753
00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:09.939
We celebrate it in your
son's name we pray. amen.

754
00:45:09.989 --> 00:45:10.830
Amen.

755
00:45:11.805 --> 00:45:12.830
- And amen.

756
00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:15.080
- Thank you pastor. that
really means a lot to us.

757
00:45:15.130 --> 00:45:16.614
- Thank you pastor. thank you.

758
00:45:16.664 --> 00:45:20.050
- And if you guys need
anything. from this church.

759
00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:22.830
from your church just give us a call.

760
00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:24.443
and we're here for you.

761
00:45:24.493 --> 00:45:25.446
Appreciate it.

762
00:45:25.496 --> 00:45:26.539
We will. thank you so much.

763
00:45:26.563 --> 00:45:28.480
- Thank you. God bless.

764
00:45:29.429 --> 00:45:30.429
- God bless.

765
00:45:34.292 --> 00:45:35.443
- Sister?

766
00:45:35.493 --> 00:45:36.940
- It's okay.

767
00:46:05.574 --> 00:46:08.170
This
is all so overwhelming.

768
00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:12.670
An absolute roller coaster
and there was no getting off.

769
00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:16.040
I was somewhere between
depression and anger.

770
00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:18.534
And all I want to do is rest.

771
00:46:19.575 --> 00:46:21.987
Maybe I can catch a few winks in the car.

772
00:46:58.909 --> 00:47:00.973
- Baby. are you okay. what's going on?

773
00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:32.493
Baby are you okay. honey?

774
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:34.343
Honey wake up.

775
00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:39.540
Honey. it's okay. it's
okay honey. it's okay.

776
00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:44.590
- I thought I saw my mom.
she was like right there.

777
00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:47.100
and then she was...

778
00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:51.847
- Honey you had a bad dream.
you had a bad dream. it's okay.

779
00:47:54.684 --> 00:47:56.796
It's gonna be okay.

780
00:47:58.845 --> 00:48:01.048
It's gonna be okay honey.
come on. come here baby.

781
00:48:03.048 --> 00:48:04.526
This was crazy.

782
00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:06.848
now I'm having dreams in my car.

783
00:48:06.898 --> 00:48:10.250
every time I close my eyes
I see her. and it's torture.

784
00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:12.490
Not being able to say goodbye.

785
00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:15.440
I had to try to get some
type of balance in my life.

786
00:48:15.490 --> 00:48:17.713
I think it's time for movie night.

787
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:21.360
- See babe. I told you was a good movie.

788
00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:24.412
- I must admit. not bad for a chick flick.

789
00:48:25.504 --> 00:48:26.546
- Did you hear that?

790
00:48:26.596 --> 00:48:27.476
- I mean a good movie.

791
00:48:27.521 --> 00:48:28.379
- A chick flick?

792
00:48:28.429 --> 00:48:30.560
I mean a good movie.
- Really?

793
00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:32.955
- Well guess who's gonna be
sleeping on the couch tonight.

794
00:48:33.005 --> 00:48:34.754
- Babe. I was just kidding.

795
00:48:34.804 --> 00:48:35.876
That's what I thought.

796
00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:36.833
That's what I thought.

797
00:48:36.883 --> 00:48:37.996
- Hey sis. I'm gonna get going okay?

798
00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:40.280
- Okay. sounds good.

799
00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:41.550
- Good night man on the couch.

800
00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:42.577
- Stop playing sis.

801
00:48:42.627 --> 00:48:44.314
- I'm gonna use your bathroom-

802
00:48:44.364 --> 00:48:45.247
- From the bedroom.

803
00:48:45.297 --> 00:48:46.148
- Okay sis. sounds good.

804
00:48:46.172 --> 00:48:47.342
Hey. call me when you get there okay?

805
00:48:47.366 --> 00:48:48.307
- Will do.

806
00:48:48.357 --> 00:48:50.127
- Honey are you coming.
going to bed honey?

807
00:48:50.177 --> 00:48:52.608
- I gotta send this email real quick babe.

808
00:48:52.658 --> 00:48:55.125
- It's time to show
you. Don't make me wait.

809
00:48:57.789 --> 00:49:00.076
- Boy. bye go to bed.

810
00:49:00.126 --> 00:49:01.255
- Come on I'm thirsty.

811
00:49:01.305 --> 00:49:02.982
I bet you are thirsty.

812
00:49:03.032 --> 00:49:04.141
- Don't make me wait.
get with the program.

813
00:49:04.165 --> 00:49:06.167
- I'm gonna make you wait.
you know that .

814
00:49:08.913 --> 00:49:11.163
Oh my God. you're so silly.

815
00:49:43.192 --> 00:49:45.192
Alvin. baby mom is here!

816
00:49:49.545 --> 00:49:51.182
- Oh my God!

817
00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:01.670
- Oh my God mom. oh my God are you okay?

818
00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:04.531
- Hi baby I'm okay.

819
00:50:04.581 --> 00:50:06.301
- Mom. what's wrong. I
though you were dead!

820
00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:09.883
- I know.

821
00:50:09.933 --> 00:50:12.736
I just remember getting
into the ambulance.

822
00:50:12.786 --> 00:50:17.060
They must've given me a
test. and I fell asleep.

823
00:50:19.898 --> 00:50:21.338
- Mom are you okay?

824
00:50:21.388 --> 00:50:23.317
- Yeah. I'm okay baby. I'm okay.

825
00:50:23.367 --> 00:50:26.200
- Well what happened. they
told us you were dead.

826
00:50:26.250 --> 00:50:30.313
- All I remember. was
riding in the ambulance.

827
00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:35.960
I remember they put
this stick. in my nose.

828
00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:38.223
and I must've fallen asleep or passed out.

829
00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:43.543
The next thing I remember.
is I was freezing cold.

830
00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:48.783
I felt around and I felt like
I was inside of this plastic.

831
00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:52.892
There was a zipper and I followed it up.

832
00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:55.280
I just couldn't understand.

833
00:50:55.330 --> 00:50:57.310
why they had done
something like that to me.

834
00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:00.358
Why would they put me in
one of these body bags?

835
00:51:00.408 --> 00:51:02.618
- So you mean to tell us
that you were in a body bag.

836
00:51:02.668 --> 00:51:04.328
and you weren't dead?

837
00:51:04.378 --> 00:51:05.294
- Yeah.

838
00:51:05.344 --> 00:51:06.261
- Oh my God!

839
00:51:06.311 --> 00:51:09.160
- I reached up. I was
able to get the zipper.

840
00:51:09.210 --> 00:51:14.210
I got my hand out. I got
my head out and I sat down.

841
00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:19.330
there were body bags everywhere
on the floor. on shelves.

842
00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:20.830
I just didn't understand.

843
00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:23.307
I didn't know why anyone
would put me in that room.

844
00:51:23.357 --> 00:51:24.545
in one of those things.

845
00:51:24.595 --> 00:51:26.056
- It's okay mom. it's
okay. you're here with us.

846
00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:27.886
It's okay.

847
00:51:27.936 --> 00:51:30.163
- I can't believe that
this happened to you.

848
00:51:30.213 --> 00:51:32.013
- It's okay. it's not your fault.

849
00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:34.983
But what really freaked me out.

850
00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:39.313
was some of the other bags were moving.

851
00:51:40.570 --> 00:51:43.550
And I went over to one. and I unzipped it.

852
00:51:44.650 --> 00:51:47.220
and I hand grabbed me I ran. I screamed.

853
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:49.420
I just had to get out
of those dark hallways.

854
00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:51.570
I had to get out of that hospital.

855
00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:53.002
- It's okay mom. it's okay.

856
00:51:53.052 --> 00:51:55.200
- I'm just so glad you're here.

857
00:51:58.329 --> 00:52:00.263
So you weren't the only one in there?

858
00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:06.220
- No. they must've put a
lot of people in those bags.

859
00:52:07.086 --> 00:52:09.263
they weren't dead.
