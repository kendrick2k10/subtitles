5
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.734
Okay.

6
00:00:38.867 --> 00:00:42.233
Please ask the Queen to join us.

7
00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:43.867
Did you finish?

8
00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:46.300
Yes.

9
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.600
Your eyes were
the hardest part.

10
00:00:48.734 --> 00:00:50.333
How so?

11
00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:51.834
I don't know.

12
00:00:51.967 --> 00:00:53.166
There's a twinkle living
in there

13
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.567
but surrounded by
a hint of sadness.

14
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.567
Are you suggesting something
in my life is missing?

15
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.667
I only paint what I see.

16
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:07.767
Meet me in the east wing
reception hall tonight at 8:00.

17
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.266
Mr. Riverton.

18
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.667
Good afternoon.

19
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.400
I understand you've finished.

20
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:13.967
Your Highness.

21
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:16.934
I hope it's to your liking.

22
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:20.500
Oh. it's exquisite.

23
00:01:20.633 --> 00:01:22.767
You have done brilliant work.

24
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.633
Although I. I'm sure you must be
eager to get back to the States.

25
00:01:25.767 --> 00:01:27.667
You're from Chicago. yes?

26
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.600
I am. yes.

27
00:01:28.734 --> 00:01:31.900
But I'll admit I will
miss Bundbury.

28
00:01:32.033 --> 00:01:33.800
You must at least join us
for dinner.

29
00:01:33.934 --> 00:01:35.500
Your Highness. you do have
an early dinner

30
00:01:35.633 --> 00:01:37.400
with the Minister of Education
this evening.

31
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:39.467
Of course. I nearly forgot.

32
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.800
My flight is early tomorrow
and I still have to pack anyway.

33
00:01:41.934 --> 00:01:44.734
but it would've been nice.

34
00:01:44.867 --> 00:01:45.967
Ah. Camille.

35
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.400
Please be sure Mr. Riverton
receives his compensation.

36
00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:49.600
Of course. Your Highness.

37
00:01:49.734 --> 00:01:50.667
Thank you.

38
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.967
I'll stop in to say goodbye
before I leave.

39
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.600
It's been an honor
painting you.

40
00:01:54.734 --> 00:01:56.767
I've loved every moment.

41
00:02:04.433 --> 00:02:06.900
Do you not want to see?

42
00:02:11.867 --> 00:02:13.166
Oh.

43
00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:15.400
It's beautiful.

44
00:02:15.533 --> 00:02:17.166
Mm-hmm.

45
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.633
Though is that really
how I look?

46
00:02:19.767 --> 00:02:20.800
Maybe I should've smiled.

47
00:02:21.967 --> 00:02:23.233
Well. you would be the first.

48
00:02:23.367 --> 00:02:27.266
This job doesn't exactly allow
for much levity.

49
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.734
I'm so glad we've captured
this moment in time.

50
00:02:32.867 --> 00:02:38.667
You in between being a young
woman and the future queen.

51
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.900
Your father would've been
so proud.

52
00:02:42.033 --> 00:02:43.467
Especially if he knew
all the wonderful things

53
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.900
you've been doing for
the country as of late.

54
00:02:46.033 --> 00:02:49.166
Speaking of.
do I have a 2:00?

55
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.200
Ah. Yes.

56
00:02:51.934 --> 00:02:54.166
Well then. you best get to it.

57
00:02:56.133 --> 00:02:57.967
What time will we be finished
having dinner?

58
00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.967
Oh. don't worry.
you'll be done by 8:00.

59
00:03:00.166 --> 00:03:01.166
Good.

60
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.900
Also. your new Instagram post
on early education

61
00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:04.700
just got 10.000 likes.

62
00:03:04.834 --> 00:03:06.400
Hm.

63
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.533
You look beautiful. Amelia.

64
00:03:25.667 --> 00:03:26.967
Thank you.

65
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.967
So. I haven't been
imagining this.

66
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.700
this thing between us
these last few weeks?

67
00:03:34.834 --> 00:03:37.433
What thing would that be?

68
00:03:37.567 --> 00:03:38.500
Oh.

69
00:03:38.633 --> 00:03:40.900
I'm so sorry. I shouldn't
have presumed that...

70
00:03:41.033 --> 00:03:42.266
No.

71
00:03:43.767 --> 00:03:45.734
You weren't imagining.

72
00:03:47.133 --> 00:03:51.400
To be honest. I've never
had such great conversations
with anyone.

73
00:03:51.533 --> 00:03:53.967
It's not like the men
I meet here.

74
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.367
The formalities.

75
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.700
With you it's been easy.

76
00:03:57.834 --> 00:03:59.533
Real. it's refreshing.

77
00:03:59.667 --> 00:04:01.133
You don't mind
that I'm not royalty?

78
00:04:01.266 --> 00:04:02.300
No.

79
00:04:02.433 --> 00:04:04.633
I prefer it.

80
00:04:04.767 --> 00:04:07.533
I like you for you. Wes.

81
00:04:07.667 --> 00:04:10.266
And I'd love to go to all
the places we've talked about.

82
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.166
So come visit me
in the States.

83
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.667
I would love to.

84
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.934
I need to see when I'm able.

85
00:04:18.066 --> 00:04:19.367
My mother is stepping down
next year.

86
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.000
You'll be queen soon.
I understand.

87
00:04:22.133 --> 00:04:24.633
No pressure.

88
00:04:24.767 --> 00:04:26.633
Just an open invite for you
to visit me

89
00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:30.734
and for us to explore
what this is.

90
00:04:32.734 --> 00:04:35.000
Because I would love to.

91
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.200
Is everything okay?

92
00:04:46.333 --> 00:04:47.467
Yeah. sorry.

93
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.433
Oh. My mother.

94
00:04:50.467 --> 00:04:52.166
Sorry. She's always
watching over.

95
00:04:54.967 --> 00:04:56.767
I'll see you in the morning.

96
00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.066
You have my cell. email.
all that.

97
00:05:12.066 --> 00:05:14.200
Your Majesty.

98
00:05:16.333 --> 00:05:18.333
Thank you for everything.

99
00:05:18.467 --> 00:05:20.233
Safe travels.

100
00:05:47.734 --> 00:05:53.333
So... I assume you and
Wes became acquainted
during his stay.

101
00:05:53.467 --> 00:05:54.934
Yes.

102
00:05:55.066 --> 00:05:57.700
He's a wonderful man. Mother.

103
00:05:57.834 --> 00:06:00.166
Fascinating what he does
with art.

104
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.800
His paintings are so much more
than just portraits.

105
00:06:02.934 --> 00:06:06.300
He really delves into the
psychology of his subjects.

106
00:06:06.433 --> 00:06:07.900
Hmm.

107
00:06:08.033 --> 00:06:10.166
I know portraits are far less
common than they used to be.

108
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.567
but 'tis a tradition
of the Crown.

109
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.633
Yes. And I thoroughly enjoyed
it in spite of all the pain

110
00:06:14.767 --> 00:06:16.433
from four weeks of not moving
my neck.

111
00:06:17.667 --> 00:06:18.800
A stiff neck will be the least
of your worries

112
00:06:18.934 --> 00:06:21.934
when you become queen.

113
00:06:22.066 --> 00:06:23.133
So...

114
00:06:23.266 --> 00:06:25.433
What else did you both discuss?

115
00:06:25.567 --> 00:06:27.734
All the amazing places
he's been.

116
00:06:27.867 --> 00:06:29.900
Can you believe he's been
to all 50 states?

117
00:06:30.033 --> 00:06:30.834
Hmm.

118
00:06:30.967 --> 00:06:31.633
Impressive.

119
00:06:31.767 --> 00:06:33.066
Sounds like your father.

120
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.266
He was a little bit of a
vagabond before we met.

121
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.767
We also talked about
my upbringing.

122
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.400
my training over the years.
studying to be queen.

123
00:06:41.533 --> 00:06:43.133
He thought it strange I did
not need to be married

124
00:06:43.266 --> 00:06:44.100
to become queen.

125
00:06:44.233 --> 00:06:46.734
And I told him this isn't
the Dark Ages.

126
00:06:46.867 --> 00:06:49.467
Well. hopefully you will meet
someone before I step down.

127
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.667
But darling. I don't think that
person is Wes.

128
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.734
I see.

129
00:07:02.867 --> 00:07:05.066
He lives halfway around
the world.

130
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.166
Mother. it shouldn't matter

131
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.133
where a person you fall
in love with comes from.

132
00:07:08.266 --> 00:07:11.300
Who said anything about love?

133
00:07:11.433 --> 00:07:13.667
That's not what I meant.

134
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.166
Oh dear.

135
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.500
You must realize
it could never work.

136
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.467
My dear niece.

137
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.967
To what do I owe
the pleasure?

138
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.400
Hello Uncle.

139
00:07:42.533 --> 00:07:44.300
I hope I'm not calling
too early.

140
00:07:44.433 --> 00:07:45.333
Oh. no. no. no.

141
00:07:45.467 --> 00:07:47.834
Us Angelinos are
always up early.

142
00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:49.900
Gearing up to take over
the throne. I suppose?

143
00:07:50.033 --> 00:07:51.633
It's coming ever closer.

144
00:07:51.767 --> 00:07:53.567
Yes. we are.

145
00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:54.800
But that's not why I'm calling.

146
00:07:54.934 --> 00:07:56.533
Don't you have a birthday
coming up?

147
00:07:56.667 --> 00:07:58.333
Oh. yes.

148
00:07:58.467 --> 00:08:00.467
Turning 39 yet again.

149
00:08:02.433 --> 00:08:04.467
Any birthday wishes this year?

150
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.066
Well. assuming a boyfriend
is too much to ask for.

151
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.033
how about a visit
from my favorite niece?

152
00:08:10.166 --> 00:08:12.633
I would love nothing more.

153
00:08:14.433 --> 00:08:17.567
But can you help
convince Mother?

154
00:08:20.934 --> 00:08:23.333
Anything for you. dear.

155
00:08:25.934 --> 00:08:27.567
Right then.

156
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.266
All right. Andreas.

157
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.934
Lovely.

158
00:08:31.066 --> 00:08:32.834
See you then.

159
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.967
I just got off the phone
with your uncle.

160
00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:42.066
He suggested the Crown was well
overdue for a visit to America

161
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.300
with a not so subtle suggestion
that his birthday was coming up.

162
00:08:46.433 --> 00:08:49.300
So. I told him we'd travel over.

163
00:08:49.433 --> 00:08:50.633
Wonderful idea. Mother.

164
00:08:50.767 --> 00:08:51.633
Hmm.

165
00:08:51.767 --> 00:08:53.233
I'd forgotten how convincing
he could be.

166
00:08:53.367 --> 00:08:55.200
which is probably why
he's such a good emissary

167
00:08:55.333 --> 00:08:56.467
to the American people.

168
00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.066
Yes.

169
00:08:59.066 --> 00:09:01.800
You didn't talk him
into all this. did you?

170
00:09:01.934 --> 00:09:02.934
No.

171
00:09:03.066 --> 00:09:05.867
No. I... I only said that
I would enjoy seeing him.

172
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Ah.

173
00:09:07.133 --> 00:09:09.700
Very well. we leave for
Los Angeles in two weeks.

174
00:09:09.834 --> 00:09:13.133
I'll have Camille build
an itinerary for our trip.

175
00:09:13.266 --> 00:09:14.834
If you'd like.

176
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.533
Amelia...

177
00:09:17.667 --> 00:09:21.033
I'm sure you were hoping
to spend some time in Chicago.

178
00:09:21.166 --> 00:09:22.767
But this is the role.

179
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:24.000
You have to accept it.

180
00:09:24.133 --> 00:09:26.934
You can't just run off whenever
and wherever you like.

181
00:09:27.066 --> 00:09:28.600
Yes. Mother.

182
00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:31.767
After all. it's been
two months.

183
00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.967
Yes. Mother.

184
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:35.700
Good.

185
00:09:45.133 --> 00:09:45.967
You wanted to see me. sir?

186
00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.266
Yes.

187
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.300
My niece is going to visit
LA in two weeks.

188
00:09:49.433 --> 00:09:50.867
and when that happens
I think we should hire

189
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.533
an additional security team
to help out around here.

190
00:09:54.667 --> 00:09:56.433
It'll probably be good
to train an extra hand

191
00:09:56.567 --> 00:09:57.967
to fill in for Mattias
in case something happens

192
00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.600
while I'm on my vacation
as well.

193
00:09:59.734 --> 00:10:00.600
Oh. right.

194
00:10:00.734 --> 00:10:02.266
Your big camping trip.
when do you leave?

195
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.433
Three weeks from next Tuesday. sir.

196
00:10:03.567 --> 00:10:06.166
Perfect timing. because
when they arrive

197
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.700
you are going to have
the most important task.

198
00:10:09.834 --> 00:10:10.934
Which is?

199
00:10:11.066 --> 00:10:13.000
To serve and protect

200
00:10:13.133 --> 00:10:15.633
Bundbury's most valuable
treasure... my niece.

201
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.834
We're going to America!

202
00:10:27.967 --> 00:10:29.367
We're going to America!

203
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.467
We're going to America!

204
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.667
Are we going to see Wes?

205
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:33.900
Of course.

206
00:10:34.033 --> 00:10:36.033
First. we'll see my uncle in LA
and then I'll see Wes.

207
00:10:36.166 --> 00:10:38.934
Well. how far is Chicago
from LA?

208
00:10:39.066 --> 00:10:40.900
Not sure.

209
00:10:49.567 --> 00:10:54.433
The United States really is
quite a large country. isn't it?

210
00:10:54.567 --> 00:10:56.200
That's fine.

211
00:10:56.333 --> 00:10:58.367
Wes will come to me.

212
00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.367
I know it.

213
00:11:02.867 --> 00:11:04.000
How are you?

214
00:11:04.133 --> 00:11:05.100
Great thanks.

215
00:11:05.233 --> 00:11:06.600
And you. what's new?

216
00:11:06.734 --> 00:11:09.867
It's finally happening.
I'm coming to America.

217
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.233
We arrive in two weeks.

218
00:11:11.367 --> 00:11:12.700
Well. that's wonderful.

219
00:11:12.834 --> 00:11:14.066
This is what you always wanted.

220
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.567
It really is.

221
00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:19.533
And we have a chance to be
together again.

222
00:11:19.667 --> 00:11:21.867
That is if you can come
to Los Angeles.

223
00:11:23.333 --> 00:11:25.734
Amelia. you know that
I would love to see you

224
00:11:25.867 --> 00:11:27.367
more than anything.

225
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.200
It's just... remember last month
when I told you

226
00:11:29.333 --> 00:11:31.367
I had an opening
coming up soon?

227
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.667
I just have so much to do
to get ready and I...

228
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.567
I don't know if it's realistic
for me to take a trip right now.

229
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.200
I see.

230
00:11:40.333 --> 00:11:42.033
But what if you came here?

231
00:11:42.166 --> 00:11:44.100
You could be my plus one
at the opening.

232
00:11:44.233 --> 00:11:48.400
I mean after all. you did
inspire my latest piece.

233
00:11:48.533 --> 00:11:50.367
Well. of course. I'd love to be
at your opening.

234
00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.066
It would be an honor.

235
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.266
Maybe you could stop
in Chicago

236
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.400
for a few days
before you return.

237
00:11:55.533 --> 00:11:58.333
Sounds like it would be
perfect timing.

238
00:11:58.467 --> 00:12:01.633
I'll see what I can do.

239
00:12:01.767 --> 00:12:03.800
You have to wear this.

240
00:12:03.934 --> 00:12:05.266
Ugh. the one from my portrait.

241
00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.000
It's far too regal.

242
00:12:07.133 --> 00:12:09.567
You are regal.

243
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.333
You're going to be queen.
Take it.

244
00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.166
I never see you wear these.

245
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.767
Yes. They're a gift from
the French Ambassador.

246
00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:26.000
They're quite expensive.

247
00:12:26.133 --> 00:12:30.133
Well. you should have some
jewelry for formal events.

248
00:12:30.266 --> 00:12:32.333
You're being quite pushy.

249
00:12:34.367 --> 00:12:35.900
I'm much more worried
about what I'm going to wear

250
00:12:36.033 --> 00:12:38.633
to Wes's art opening.

251
00:12:38.767 --> 00:12:40.166
If you go.

252
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.400
When I go.

253
00:12:42.533 --> 00:12:44.467
And how do you plan
to do that?

254
00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.800
Every moment will be scheduled.

255
00:12:47.934 --> 00:12:50.233
Where there is a purpose
there is a path.

256
00:12:50.367 --> 00:12:52.000
This one.

257
00:12:52.133 --> 00:12:56.233
It's perfect for an art opening.
don't you think?

258
00:12:56.367 --> 00:12:58.300
America. here we come.

259
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.767
Oh.

260
00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:21.133
Oh. I'll take your passports
for safekeeping.

261
00:13:21.266 --> 00:13:22.200
Mother. we're grown women.

262
00:13:22.333 --> 00:13:23.834
We're not going
to misplace them.

263
00:13:23.967 --> 00:13:25.300
It's not that.

264
00:13:25.433 --> 00:13:26.633
Your uncle secures them
in a safe.

265
00:13:26.767 --> 00:13:28.233
It's protocol.

266
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.367
- Oh.
- Thank you.

267
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:32.567
Protocol.

268
00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.967
Little brother.
how I've missed you.

269
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.867
My dear sister.

270
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.734
And look at this young woman.

271
00:13:47.867 --> 00:13:49.834
I hear you've been doing
wonderful things.

272
00:13:49.967 --> 00:13:50.867
Thank you. Uncle.
So good to see you.

273
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.066
Pleasure's all mine.
Please. in. in. in.

274
00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:53.900
Camille. how are you?

275
00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:55.734
Lovely. And you. dashing
as ever.

276
00:13:55.867 --> 00:13:58.000
Ah. to be young and beautiful
as yourself.

277
00:13:58.133 --> 00:14:02.767
Apologies. it hasn't rained like
this since 1927 in Los Angeles.

278
00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:05.900
I'd like to introduce you to
my head of security. Grady Beck.

279
00:14:06.033 --> 00:14:07.467
Nice to meet you all. Welcome.

280
00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:12.133
Amelia. Grady will tend to you
during your stay.

281
00:14:12.266 --> 00:14:13.600
Tend to me during my stay?

282
00:14:13.734 --> 00:14:17.300
As your personal security.

283
00:14:17.433 --> 00:14:18.567
Do I need that?

284
00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:20.467
If you'd like to go see
the Hollywood sign

285
00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.433
or any of the other sights.
you might.

286
00:14:22.567 --> 00:14:24.767
May I take your luggage upstairs
to your room?

287
00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:25.834
No. thank you.
I can take it.

288
00:14:25.967 --> 00:14:27.700
And just to be clear. I don't
need a bodyguard.

289
00:14:27.834 --> 00:14:29.600
Amelia... give Grady
a chance.

290
00:14:29.734 --> 00:14:31.233
He knows the town like
the back of his hand.

291
00:14:31.367 --> 00:14:33.033
He'll take you anywhere
you want to go.

292
00:14:33.166 --> 00:14:34.700
This is Los Angeles. dear.

293
00:14:34.834 --> 00:14:37.066
Like any big city
it can be dangerous.

294
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.100
Absolutely. We have round
the clock security here.

295
00:14:39.233 --> 00:14:40.333
even in Beverly Hills.

296
00:14:40.467 --> 00:14:45.633
We want you well taken care of.
And Grady is the best.

297
00:14:45.767 --> 00:14:48.133
I doubt anyone here even knows
who we are.

298
00:14:48.266 --> 00:14:49.900
Actually. I knew who both
of you were

299
00:14:50.033 --> 00:14:51.300
from your social media presence

300
00:14:51.433 --> 00:14:54.233
even before I began working
for the ambassador.

301
00:14:54.367 --> 00:14:55.433
Well. Camille handles all that.

302
00:14:55.567 --> 00:14:56.934
I don't really pay
much attention.

303
00:14:57.066 --> 00:14:58.000
Others do.

304
00:14:58.133 --> 00:15:00.967
And I assure you
they'll recognize you as well.

305
00:15:02.967 --> 00:15:03.700
Tea?

306
00:15:03.834 --> 00:15:05.033
Let's get the kettle on.

307
00:15:05.166 --> 00:15:06.467
This way.

308
00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.433
So.

309
00:15:17.567 --> 00:15:19.200
What are the big birthday plans?

310
00:15:19.333 --> 00:15:20.967
Well. tomorrow we're going
to host a little party

311
00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.700
on the grounds and I'll
introduce you

312
00:15:22.834 --> 00:15:24.500
to my crazy American friends.

313
00:15:24.633 --> 00:15:25.767
Ah. Camille.

314
00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.700
Could you get us a full
itinerary for Amelia and myself

315
00:15:28.834 --> 00:15:31.800
including any lunches.
charity auctions.

316
00:15:31.934 --> 00:15:34.500
diplomatic and consular events.
dinner plans.

317
00:15:34.633 --> 00:15:37.333
and any one-on-one meetings we
have scheduled with the various

318
00:15:37.467 --> 00:15:41.000
dignitaries Andreas
would like us to meet?

319
00:15:41.133 --> 00:15:43.300
I'll have those for you
at 9:00 AM tomorrow.

320
00:15:43.433 --> 00:15:44.567
Lovely.

321
00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.700
And I'm assuming that Grady
will be accompanying Amelia?

322
00:15:47.834 --> 00:15:49.333
Yes. absolutely.

323
00:15:49.467 --> 00:15:50.667
As I said. won't a bodyguard

324
00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.700
following me around stir up
more attention?

325
00:15:52.834 --> 00:15:55.467
Oh. touring this city alone
would not only be irresponsible

326
00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.633
but also reckless.

327
00:15:57.767 --> 00:16:00.433
Right. I'll take Camille
with me.

328
00:16:02.734 --> 00:16:06.166
I see not much has changed
with you. my dear niece.

329
00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.233
Do you remember when
she was seven years old

330
00:16:08.367 --> 00:16:10.734
and there was a tour of American
children came through the castle

331
00:16:10.867 --> 00:16:12.433
and she tried to sneak out
with them?

332
00:16:12.567 --> 00:16:14.867
I was homeschooled every day.
What do you expect?

333
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.533
And didn't you try to steal
your mother's horse

334
00:16:16.667 --> 00:16:17.834
when you were 13?

335
00:16:17.967 --> 00:16:18.934
Hmm. she did indeed.

336
00:16:19.066 --> 00:16:20.200
She took it down to the beach

337
00:16:20.333 --> 00:16:21.834
and tried to escape
on a little dinghy.

338
00:16:21.967 --> 00:16:23.767
It was a bleak and depressing
winter that year.

339
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.567
Vitamin D deficiency
is a real thing okay?

340
00:16:27.333 --> 00:16:31.266
You really blossomed into an
incredible young woman. Amelia.

341
00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.200
Thank you. Uncle.

342
00:16:33.333 --> 00:16:35.166
Hopefully with a bit
more culture

343
00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:38.333
and worldly experience of my own
before Mother steps down

344
00:16:38.467 --> 00:16:41.100
I will be properly equipped
to wear the Crown.

345
00:16:41.233 --> 00:16:44.333
Hear. hear.

346
00:16:44.467 --> 00:16:45.900
Indeed you will.

347
00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:04.100
Do you need anything
before I go to bed?

348
00:17:04.233 --> 00:17:05.734
I'm good thanks.

349
00:17:05.867 --> 00:17:07.734
Maybe I should just book
a ticket and fly up there

350
00:17:07.867 --> 00:17:10.500
this weekend for the opening.

351
00:17:10.633 --> 00:17:12.467
Your mother still has
our passports

352
00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.066
and those are pretty essential

353
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.800
for getting on a commercial
flight these days.

354
00:17:16.934 --> 00:17:19.900
Especially if you don't have any
other ID because you're royalty.

355
00:17:20.033 --> 00:17:21.667
Also. your uncle was right.

356
00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.433
It's not safe for you
to go alone.

357
00:17:23.567 --> 00:17:24.900
All right.

358
00:17:25.033 --> 00:17:26.000
You can come with me.

359
00:17:26.133 --> 00:17:28.066
Absolutely not.

360
00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.166
I've been there before
and I am not dealing with

361
00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.000
the wrath of the Queen again.

362
00:17:32.133 --> 00:17:34.633
Oh. come on. That was
a long time ago.

363
00:17:34.767 --> 00:17:38.767
Can't I still have nightmares?

364
00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.467
Fine. I'll make plans
of my own.

365
00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.133
Or you could just tell Wes

366
00:17:44.266 --> 00:17:46.467
about the restraints
you're under.

367
00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.100
Perhaps if he understood

368
00:17:48.233 --> 00:17:51.166
he'd make more of an effort
to come out here.

369
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.667
Anyway. I'm going to bed.

370
00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.166
Good night.

371
00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.700
Or maybe I just need to think
more creatively

372
00:18:04.834 --> 00:18:06.633
abouout how to escape.

373
00:18:12.533 --> 00:18:13.633
Wes. hi.

374
00:18:13.767 --> 00:18:16.800
I'm just calling to let you know
that I'm working it out

375
00:18:16.934 --> 00:18:20.100
to actually drive up to Chicago
to see you

376
00:18:20.233 --> 00:18:21.867
first thing tomorrow morning.

377
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.900
So. um. call me back
when you can.

378
00:18:28.033 --> 00:18:29.867
Okay.

379
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.066
Bye.

380
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:31.800
Morning.

381
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.633
You again.

382
00:18:38.867 --> 00:18:41.100
Were you eavesdropping
on my phone call just now?

383
00:18:41.233 --> 00:18:42.867
Nope.

384
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.433
Just cleaning up the SUV in case
we decide to take it out.

385
00:18:47.567 --> 00:18:49.066
I guess it's safe to assume

386
00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.033
you're going to follow me around
the party tonight as well then.

387
00:18:52.166 --> 00:18:53.900
Not following.

388
00:18:54.033 --> 00:18:55.033
Keeping an eye out.

389
00:18:55.166 --> 00:18:56.100
Okay.

390
00:18:56.233 --> 00:18:57.100
You're worried one of my uncle's
socialite friends

391
00:18:57.233 --> 00:19:00.266
is going to kidnap
the princess for ransom?

392
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.767
Well that is on the end
of extreme.

393
00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:05.100
But you know what?
It is my job to be prepared.

394
00:19:05.233 --> 00:19:06.333
Hmm.

395
00:19:06.467 --> 00:19:08.333
Well. my uncle must really
trust you

396
00:19:08.467 --> 00:19:11.300
to give you such responsibility.

397
00:19:11.433 --> 00:19:12.834
He does.

398
00:19:12.967 --> 00:19:14.767
Fine.

399
00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.400
Great.

400
00:19:22.233 --> 00:19:23.467
I've got to-

401
00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:27.300
I've left something that I was
going to get.

402
00:19:27.433 --> 00:19:28.834
Inside.

403
00:19:28.967 --> 00:19:30.367
Watch out for that.

404
00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:31.867
Thank you.

405
00:19:54.333 --> 00:19:57.300
You look stunning.

406
00:19:57.433 --> 00:19:58.800
Thank you.

407
00:19:58.934 --> 00:20:00.467
And the clutch is pretty too.

408
00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.867
Well. I need a place to stash
the bodyguard's keys

409
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.767
when I take them.

410
00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.100
What?

411
00:20:06.233 --> 00:20:08.433
I'm sneaking out
tomorrow morning

412
00:20:08.567 --> 00:20:11.266
and driving straight to Chicago
to see Wes.

413
00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.100
Tell me you're kidding.

414
00:20:13.233 --> 00:20:15.033
You'll see.

415
00:20:15.166 --> 00:20:16.200
All right.

416
00:20:16.333 --> 00:20:19.967
Let's go check out our first
big Beverly Hills party.

417
00:20:23.934 --> 00:20:26.433
I've heard so much about you.
It's lovely to meet you.

418
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.600
You ladies look lovely.

419
00:20:36.734 --> 00:20:38.800
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

420
00:20:38.934 --> 00:20:41.300
You clean up nicely too.
Mr. Beck.

421
00:20:41.433 --> 00:20:44.967
- It is a brand-new tie.
- Hm.

422
00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:46.000
Nicely.

423
00:20:46.133 --> 00:20:48.767
That man is ravishing.

424
00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:49.934
He couldn't keep his eyes
off you.

425
00:20:50.066 --> 00:20:52.200
Oh. that's only because
he thinks I'm a loose cannon.

426
00:20:52.333 --> 00:20:54.500
Lovely. thank you.

427
00:20:54.633 --> 00:20:55.633
Hello. Mummy.

428
00:20:55.767 --> 00:20:56.667
Ah.

429
00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.500
And who is a loose cannon dear?

430
00:20:58.633 --> 00:21:00.533
Oh nobody.

431
00:21:01.734 --> 00:21:03.200
Well...

432
00:21:03.333 --> 00:21:05.567
Shall we get about making
a good impression?

433
00:21:08.033 --> 00:21:09.033
Hello?

434
00:21:09.166 --> 00:21:10.233
Yes.

435
00:21:10.367 --> 00:21:11.834
How do you do?

436
00:21:22.633 --> 00:21:24.200
Please don't do that.
Mr. Beck.

437
00:21:24.333 --> 00:21:25.533
It's Grady.

438
00:21:25.667 --> 00:21:26.567
And do what exactly?

439
00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:27.367
Lurk.

440
00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:28.333
Lurk?

441
00:21:28.467 --> 00:21:29.734
I'm just doing my job.

442
00:21:29.867 --> 00:21:31.233
You act like you've never had
security detail

443
00:21:31.367 --> 00:21:32.166
in your entire life.

444
00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:33.400
I've never had anyone
in my shadow.

445
00:21:33.533 --> 00:21:34.400
That's for certain.

446
00:21:34.533 --> 00:21:36.033
You're my boss's niece
and you're one of

447
00:21:36.166 --> 00:21:37.433
the most important people
in the world to him.

448
00:21:37.567 --> 00:21:39.033
Not to mention you stand out
in a crowd.

449
00:21:39.166 --> 00:21:41.500
So please forgive me if I take
my job seriously.

450
00:21:41.633 --> 00:21:43.567
I stand out?

451
00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.066
Guess it's the whole
princess thing.

452
00:21:59.166 --> 00:22:00.934
Maybe I'd like to dance.

453
00:22:01.066 --> 00:22:04.333
Or am I not allowed to do
that unattended either?

454
00:22:04.467 --> 00:22:06.133
Of course. you can dance.

455
00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:11.800
Thanks.

456
00:22:58.300 --> 00:22:59.467
Morning.

457
00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.000
What are you doing?

458
00:23:01.133 --> 00:23:02.967
This is my car.
What are you doing?

459
00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.834
I. was just-

460
00:23:05.967 --> 00:23:07.834
I found your keys on the floor
of the party last night

461
00:23:07.967 --> 00:23:09.967
and I was going to leave them
in the vehicle.

462
00:23:11.166 --> 00:23:13.500
Well. that certainly explains
the suitcase.

463
00:23:13.633 --> 00:23:15.567
Look. I need to get
to Chicago all right?

464
00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.500
There is a man there
that I have feelings for

465
00:23:17.633 --> 00:23:19.834
and this might be my only chance
I get to see him.

466
00:23:19.967 --> 00:23:21.867
And you felt the need to steal
a car to do that.

467
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.333
Oh. come on.
You've met my mother.

468
00:23:25.467 --> 00:23:27.834
Why not just fly?
It'd be a lot faster you know.

469
00:23:27.967 --> 00:23:29.000
She has my passport.

470
00:23:29.133 --> 00:23:30.800
Plus. I have no money
of my own.

471
00:23:30.934 --> 00:23:33.467
And driving across the US
sounds like fun.

472
00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.166
Something I've always
wanted to do.

473
00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:37.400
You know I can't let you go.
right?

474
00:23:37.533 --> 00:23:38.667
It is way too dangerous.

475
00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.033
Not sure you're
a capable driver.

476
00:23:40.166 --> 00:23:41.233
Drive me there then.

477
00:23:42.467 --> 00:23:44.900
That's not. that's not happening.

478
00:23:45.033 --> 00:23:46.633
Plus. I already told your uncle.

479
00:23:46.767 --> 00:23:47.867
You what?

480
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.133
He would've killed me
if I hadn't.

481
00:23:49.266 --> 00:23:53.300
Plus. I happen to like my job.
So yeah. yeah. I told him.

482
00:23:53.433 --> 00:23:55.166
Amelia. What are you doing?

483
00:23:56.066 --> 00:23:58.467
I'm just borrowing your car
to go see the artist

484
00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.667
you recommended.

485
00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.900
The one who painted my portrait.
The one from Chicago.

486
00:24:02.033 --> 00:24:05.433
Wes Riverton.
Oh. my.

487
00:24:05.567 --> 00:24:08.700
We spent a month getting
to know each other.

488
00:24:08.834 --> 00:24:10.967
I need to see him to see
if it's real.

489
00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.300
Amelia. your mother
would never let you

490
00:24:12.433 --> 00:24:13.800
traipse off without security.

491
00:24:13.934 --> 00:24:16.867
Mother would never
let me go at all.

492
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:17.967
But you would.

493
00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:20.233
Is that the real reason
you came to the States?

494
00:24:20.367 --> 00:24:22.767
To see Wes?

495
00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:24.667
I'm sorry Uncle.

496
00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.066
I didn't know another way.

497
00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.266
You know. I initially came here

498
00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.900
following my heart
over a man as well.

499
00:24:37.033 --> 00:24:38.934
You must go.

500
00:24:40.066 --> 00:24:42.033
- Really?
- Yes.

501
00:24:42.166 --> 00:24:44.433
Thank you. thank you.

502
00:24:44.567 --> 00:24:47.066
Thank you so much.

503
00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:47.967
What about Mother?

504
00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:49.567
Well you're a grown woman.

505
00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:52.400
You deserve a big adventure
before you assume your duties.

506
00:24:52.533 --> 00:24:54.600
I'll take the heat.

507
00:24:54.734 --> 00:24:56.533
Thank you. Uncle.

508
00:24:56.667 --> 00:24:57.533
I love you.

509
00:24:57.667 --> 00:24:59.300
And I you.

510
00:24:59.433 --> 00:25:00.500
Grady. get your things.

511
00:25:00.633 --> 00:25:01.367
Sir. um...

512
00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:04.433
My camping trip up the coast.

513
00:25:04.567 --> 00:25:05.667
I was supposed to leave
on Tuesday?

514
00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.433
Yes. Well. you can
take it after.

515
00:25:07.567 --> 00:25:10.800
Driving to Chicago is a very.
very long trip.

516
00:25:10.934 --> 00:25:11.934
It's a big ask.

517
00:25:12.066 --> 00:25:14.100
You'll be well paid. I need you
to do this. Grady.

518
00:25:14.233 --> 00:25:15.767
For me.

519
00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:20.100
And I have one more way
to make it worth your while.

520
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:24.033
Sir. are you sure?

521
00:25:24.166 --> 00:25:25.200
This is your baby.

522
00:25:25.333 --> 00:25:27.500
Absolutely. If you're going
to drive across America.

523
00:25:27.633 --> 00:25:29.367
you better do it in a Mustang.

524
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.633
Expense anything you need.

525
00:25:31.767 --> 00:25:32.800
Give my niece a little freedom.

526
00:25:32.934 --> 00:25:35.567
She's been waiting her
whole life for it after all.

527
00:25:40.967 --> 00:25:42.400
Yes sir.

528
00:25:54.667 --> 00:25:56.166
All right.

529
00:26:01.867 --> 00:26:02.767
Mwah!

530
00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:04.233
Thank you. Bye!

531
00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.867

Well. it looks to me like
we could get there

539
00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.500
by late tomorrow afternoon.

540
00:26:48.633 --> 00:26:50.166
Tomorrow afternoon.

541
00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:51.734
Not a chance.

542
00:26:51.867 --> 00:26:54.533
I'm not driving overnight
and I'm not driving that fast.

543
00:26:54.667 --> 00:26:56.667
Plus. if you want to see
anything other than gas stations

544
00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:00.300
and fast food outlets that's
going to take even more time.

545
00:27:00.433 --> 00:27:01.500
What do you mean?

546
00:27:01.633 --> 00:27:05.100
We are bound to hit traffic.
probably construction.

547
00:27:05.233 --> 00:27:06.967
Not to mention the breaks
we'll need along the way.

548
00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:09.300
You're quite the optimist. hmm?

549
00:27:09.433 --> 00:27:10.567
Sorry.

550
00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:11.934
Turns out I don't like
being pulled away

551
00:27:12.066 --> 00:27:14.567
from my days off to play
cross-country chauffeur.

552
00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.433
Well. you're not just driving.

553
00:27:16.567 --> 00:27:18.500
You're here to protect me.
right?

554
00:27:18.633 --> 00:27:19.567
I thought you didn't
need protection.

555
00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:21.133
And I thought you were always
supposed to do

556
00:27:21.266 --> 00:27:22.767
what was asked of you.

557
00:27:27.533 --> 00:27:31.166
Ugh. Mother is already
texting me.

558
00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.133
What are you going
to tell her?

559
00:27:32.266 --> 00:27:33.600
I'm just going to send her
this photo

560
00:27:33.734 --> 00:27:34.700
I took of the Hollywood sign

561
00:27:34.834 --> 00:27:36.533
on our way out so she
still thinks I'm local.

562
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.467
So. how long do you think it's
going to take us realistically

563
00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.400
to get there?

564
00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:49.400
Realistically?

565
00:27:49.533 --> 00:27:51.633
Um. Monday night?

566
00:27:51.767 --> 00:27:53.633
Wes's opening
isn't till Wednesday

567
00:27:53.767 --> 00:27:55.900
so it gives us plenty of time.

568
00:27:56.033 --> 00:28:00.967
All right then.
We've got a plan.

569
00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:03.433
Just a lot further to go.

570
00:28:08.266 --> 00:28:11.033
Can we eat soon?
I'm a bit hungry.

571
00:28:11.533 --> 00:28:14.967
I'll just pull right over.
In the desert.

572
00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:16.834
Okay.

573
00:28:18.867 --> 00:28:20.166
Never going to find something
out here

574
00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:21.834
in the middle of nowhere.

575
00:28:21.967 --> 00:28:24.166
Alright. Turns out there was
a place out here

576
00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:25.767
in the middle of nowhere.

577
00:28:30.033 --> 00:28:33.533
What? Still afraid someone's
going to kidnap me?

578
00:28:33.667 --> 00:28:35.233
Well. I guess. if they did
I could finally go

579
00:28:35.367 --> 00:28:36.900
on my camping trip.

580
00:28:39.867 --> 00:28:42.200
This is so strange.

581
00:28:42.333 --> 00:28:43.900
They serve breakfast here
all day.

582
00:28:44.033 --> 00:28:45.400
Why?

583
00:28:45.533 --> 00:28:47.300
Some people like breakfast.

584
00:28:47.433 --> 00:28:49.133
Even for lunch or dinner.

585
00:28:49.266 --> 00:28:50.367
Fascinating.

586
00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:54.066
I'm going to order something
I'm never able to at home.

587
00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.667
So why is it that you've never
been to the States before?

588
00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.300
My father actually scheduled

589
00:28:59.433 --> 00:29:01.867
a tour across America
for the two of us

590
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.600
but passed away unexpectedly
before we got to do it.

591
00:29:06.734 --> 00:29:08.367
I'm sorry to hear that.

592
00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.033
He said when he travelled
across America

593
00:29:10.166 --> 00:29:12.066
he didn't just learn about
the country.

594
00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:15.233
he learned about himself.

595
00:29:15.367 --> 00:29:17.400
Is that what this whole trip
is about?

596
00:29:17.533 --> 00:29:19.100
Your dad?

597
00:29:19.233 --> 00:29:22.133
Well. him and I realized
with mother stepping down

598
00:29:22.266 --> 00:29:25.867
I needed to travel now or seeing
Wes again might never happen.

599
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.433
So. you're in love
with this guy.

600
00:29:27.567 --> 00:29:29.400
I never said I was in love.

601
00:29:29.533 --> 00:29:33.734
Only that I see potential
for it.

602
00:29:33.867 --> 00:29:35.200
Good.

603
00:29:35.333 --> 00:29:38.400
It's impossible to fall
in love that fast.

604
00:29:38.533 --> 00:29:40.433
You don't believe in love
at first sight?

605
00:29:41.734 --> 00:29:43.033
I especially don't believe
in love at first sight.

606
00:29:43.166 --> 00:29:45.033
Oh. it takes years to build
true love.

607
00:29:45.166 --> 00:29:47.867
And even then it might not be
as true as you think.

608
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.233
Look. it's a two-way street.

609
00:29:49.367 --> 00:29:50.867
I mean like.

610
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.433
why isn't this guy meeting you
at least halfway. huh?

611
00:29:54.567 --> 00:29:56.800
I offered to go there.

612
00:29:56.934 --> 00:29:57.700
And he's got this art opening

613
00:29:57.834 --> 00:30:00.033
he's trying to finish pieces
for that.

614
00:30:00.166 --> 00:30:03.400
And you never thought to.
I don't know.

615
00:30:03.533 --> 00:30:05.633
make him work to win
your love?

616
00:30:05.767 --> 00:30:07.266
I'm not into playing games. Grady.

617
00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.266
I didn't say anything
about games. Amelia.

618
00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.600
What can I get for y'all?

619
00:30:11.734 --> 00:30:13.700
Y'all. That's adorable.

620
00:30:13.834 --> 00:30:15.567
I think I'll have some of
your loaded fries please.

621
00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:17.800
and I'm also interested in some
of these custom add-ons.

622
00:30:17.934 --> 00:30:19.967
I'll add on bacon bits.
onions. sour cream.

623
00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:22.133
some of the melted
American cheese please.

624
00:30:22.266 --> 00:30:24.467
And some jalapeños
and extra salsa side.

625
00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.367
I like it spicy.

626
00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:27.200
Anything else?

627
00:30:27.333 --> 00:30:31.200
A vanilla shake
sounds delicious.

628
00:30:31.333 --> 00:30:33.233
American breakfast
with fruit please.

629
00:30:33.367 --> 00:30:34.967
- Gotcha.
- Gotcha.

630
00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:39.400
American breakfast. wow.
I love the sound of that.

631
00:30:39.533 --> 00:30:43.266
What do you even eat
in Bundbury?

632
00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.633
Crepes.

633
00:30:46.867 --> 00:30:49.633
Utah is so beautiful.

634
00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:01.433
♪ Driving with
the windows down ♪

635
00:31:01.567 --> 00:31:04.133
♪ Around this town

636
00:31:04.266 --> 00:31:07.800
♪ Where nothing
ever changes ♪

637
00:31:07.934 --> 00:31:10.633
♪ The roads are steeped
in history ♪

638
00:31:10.767 --> 00:31:13.033
Are we going to be able
to find someplace to stay?

639
00:31:13.166 --> 00:31:15.834
Maybe in the next town.

640
00:31:15.967 --> 00:31:17.934
Not going to be a fancy
five-star hotel though.

641
00:31:18.066 --> 00:31:19.367
That's fine. because
I wouldn't want to stay

642
00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:21.166
in some place
like that anyway.

643
00:31:24.166 --> 00:31:25.333
Weren't you going camping

644
00:31:25.467 --> 00:31:28.934
before my uncle roped you
into all this?

645
00:31:29.066 --> 00:31:29.867
Yeah.

646
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.333
Let's do that!

647
00:31:31.467 --> 00:31:32.934
You've been camping?

648
00:31:33.066 --> 00:31:34.400
No.

649
00:31:35.233 --> 00:31:37.200
But it's a true American
pastime. isn't it?

650
00:31:37.333 --> 00:31:39.000
It'll be just like in
the movies.

651
00:31:39.133 --> 00:31:41.700
only preferably
without the grizzly bears.

652
00:31:41.834 --> 00:31:43.700
We don't have any gear.

653
00:31:43.834 --> 00:31:46.033
That's what my uncle's
credit card is for.

654
00:31:46.166 --> 00:31:48.000
Okay.

655
00:31:48.133 --> 00:31:49.333
We'll camp.

656
00:31:50.233 --> 00:31:51.166
Yay!

657
00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:53.200
Camping.

658
00:31:53.867 --> 00:31:56.467
Oh. your side's much better
than my side.

659
00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:57.100
No. Don't.

660
00:31:57.233 --> 00:31:57.767
Can you move your arm?

661
00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:59.000
No.

662
00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:00.834
Oh. that's good.

663
00:32:00.967 --> 00:32:02.934
♪ ...Feel like I belong

664
00:32:07.533 --> 00:32:09.467
Hmm.

665
00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.100
Amelia. is that you?

666
00:32:14.233 --> 00:32:15.734
No. it's me.
Your Highness.

667
00:32:15.867 --> 00:32:17.266
Where's Amelia?

668
00:32:18.467 --> 00:32:20.400
A trade dinner.

669
00:32:20.533 --> 00:32:23.200
I'll go check to see if she
made it back all right.

670
00:32:23.333 --> 00:32:25.567
She sounded very tired
when we spoke.

671
00:32:28.033 --> 00:32:30.367
If Amelia wasn't with Camille.
who was she with all day?

672
00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:31.266
Grady.

673
00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:33.266
I spoke to them earlier.
She's fine.

674
00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.200
Oh.

675
00:32:34.333 --> 00:32:35.734
She did send me an awful
lot of photos

676
00:32:35.867 --> 00:32:36.900
of all the places they've been.

677
00:32:37.033 --> 00:32:37.834
No wonder she's spent.

678
00:32:37.967 --> 00:32:40.367
Just give her some space.

679
00:32:45.133 --> 00:32:46.700
Checkmate.

680
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.700
So. the princess is a fan
of hot dogs?

681
00:32:58.333 --> 00:33:00.333
They are so different
from the frankfurters

682
00:33:00.467 --> 00:33:01.400
I'm used to at home.

683
00:33:02.433 --> 00:33:04.567
I mean this relish
is to die for.

684
00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:05.500
What even is this?

685
00:33:05.633 --> 00:33:07.166
It's uh. it's basically
minced pickle.

686
00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:08.166
It's very exotic.

687
00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:09.266
Mm.

688
00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.266
Well. I appreciate the minced
pickle approach

689
00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.100
and all the other add-ons
you got from the market.

690
00:33:13.233 --> 00:33:14.667
You don't. uh-

691
00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:17.767
Usually they don't call them
add-ons. they're called fixins.

692
00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:18.500
Fixings.

693
00:33:18.633 --> 00:33:20.233
Well. I'm in fixings bliss.

694
00:33:20.367 --> 00:33:22.233
- Fixins.
- Fixins.

695
00:33:22.367 --> 00:33:23.133
There you go. Yeah.

696
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:26.734
I mean. they're not usually
this good at a Dodgers game

697
00:33:26.867 --> 00:33:28.633
or a movie theatre.
but they're close.

698
00:33:28.767 --> 00:33:30.700
Two more things to add
to my must-do list.

699
00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:36.066
Why are you so in love with
our country anyway?

700
00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:38.834
My father fell in love
with American movies.

701
00:33:38.967 --> 00:33:41.400
and growing up we'd watch all
the classics from John Wayne

702
00:33:41.533 --> 00:33:43.400
to Marilyn Monroe.

703
00:33:43.533 --> 00:33:45.600
Katherine Hepburn is actually
my favorite.

704
00:33:45.734 --> 00:33:46.800
The man taught you well.

705
00:33:46.934 --> 00:33:48.166
He did.

706
00:33:48.934 --> 00:33:52.066
I think he saw movies
as his escape.

707
00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:55.867
His role as my mother's regent
was quite restrictive.

708
00:33:59.967 --> 00:34:03.166
There you go.
Second course.

709
00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:04.834
So. you just want to hold it
near the fire

710
00:34:04.967 --> 00:34:06.800
until it's as golden
as you like.

711
00:34:06.934 --> 00:34:08.333
Okay. Right in.

712
00:34:08.467 --> 00:34:09.967
Right in. There you go.

713
00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:12.233
Did you ever think about
studying in the States?

714
00:34:12.367 --> 00:34:14.867
Yes. I actually wanted
to attend this dance academy

715
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.300
in New York.

716
00:34:17.433 --> 00:34:19.000
My mother refused.

717
00:34:19.133 --> 00:34:22.867
She said it didn't fit into
my obligations. so.

718
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.200
I've never really
fit into the mold my
mother's made for me.

719
00:34:25.333 --> 00:34:27.333
Oops! Oh. fire.

720
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:29.400
What do I do?

721
00:34:29.533 --> 00:34:31.433
Blow it out.

722
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000
Well-handled.

723
00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:36.133
An honorary American already.

724
00:34:38.667 --> 00:34:42.633
Never figured it'd be tough
being royalty.

725
00:34:42.767 --> 00:34:43.967
My father actually
encouraged me

726
00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:47.400
to live the life
I always imagined.

727
00:34:47.533 --> 00:34:51.667
And on his deathbed.
I... I promised I would.

728
00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.867
You're different than
I originally assumed.

729
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.100
Not nearly as spoiled.

730
00:35:00.834 --> 00:35:04.066
So. what about you?

731
00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:08.967
My dad owned a struggling
ranching and saddle company

732
00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:11.300
when I was growing up.

733
00:35:11.433 --> 00:35:14.200
Just took off as I graduated
high school.

734
00:35:14.333 --> 00:35:17.400
Work made him hard.

735
00:35:17.533 --> 00:35:20.100
And I told myself
when I was a kid

736
00:35:20.233 --> 00:35:23.100
that wasn't going
to happen to me.

737
00:35:23.233 --> 00:35:25.133
Does your dad still have
this ranch?

738
00:35:25.266 --> 00:35:27.400
Yeah. he does.

739
00:35:29.667 --> 00:35:31.867
We haven't talked in
a while though.

740
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.266
He wasn't exactly thrilled
when I decided to move out

741
00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:41.433
and not stick around to help out
with the family business.

742
00:35:41.567 --> 00:35:45.800
Maybe you should call him.
Sounds like you miss him.

743
00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:48.233
Maybe.

744
00:35:52.533 --> 00:35:54.133
I'm going to stop you
right there.

745
00:35:54.266 --> 00:35:57.567
What you're doing is hurting me
on a metaphysical level.

746
00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:58.767
Here you want to.

747
00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:00.367
Let me just spread it
because I don't have a knife.

748
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000
Here. you want to sandwich
the marshmallow in between.

749
00:36:04.133 --> 00:36:06.834
There. there. That's it.

750
00:36:06.967 --> 00:36:09.600
That's. that's good form. see?

751
00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:11.700
Now enjoy.

752
00:36:11.834 --> 00:36:13.367
All right. I just go for it?

753
00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:15.300
Just go for it. That's all
you've got to do. see?

754
00:36:15.433 --> 00:36:17.367
Just squish that
little fellow down.

755
00:36:18.934 --> 00:36:20.467
Perfection.

756
00:36:21.667 --> 00:36:23.633
Mmm.

757
00:36:23.767 --> 00:36:25.200
Heaven.

758
00:36:27.734 --> 00:36:29.200
Thank you.

759
00:36:29.333 --> 00:36:30.633
You're welcome.

760
00:36:33.633 --> 00:36:34.867
What are these called?

761
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.467
S'mores. Some mores.

762
00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:38.533
Oh.

763
00:36:38.667 --> 00:36:41.166
We had like a team of engineers
work on the word.

764
00:36:49.433 --> 00:36:52.834
enjoy the world

765
00:36:52.967 --> 00:36:54.800
♪ I think it's time
for me to leave ♪

766
00:36:54.934 --> 00:36:57.567
Hey look. A real
small-town festival.

767
00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:00.367
We must stop. can we?

768
00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:02.567
We're on track to be
in Chicago by Monday

769
00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:05.533
and I'm starving. so yeah.
why not?

770
00:37:05.667 --> 00:37:07.033
Great.

771
00:37:07.166 --> 00:37:08.200
What do you think?

772
00:37:08.333 --> 00:37:09.800
Gosh. this is so sweet.

773
00:37:09.934 --> 00:37:10.834
Right?

774
00:37:10.967 --> 00:37:12.533
We don't have anything like
this in Bundbury.

775
00:37:12.667 --> 00:37:14.667
Oh no. This is a quintessential
Amer-

776
00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:15.700
it's like a rite of passage.

777
00:37:15.834 --> 00:37:17.500
We did these things
all the time as a kid.

778
00:37:17.633 --> 00:37:18.567
Right. What do you call it?

779
00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:21.200
This is a county fair.

780
00:37:21.333 --> 00:37:22.367
Oh wow. County fair.

781
00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:23.734
Yeah.

782
00:37:23.867 --> 00:37:26.166
What is this?

783
00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:27.700
They don't have a ring toss
in Bundbury?

784
00:37:27.834 --> 00:37:30.066
No. What's this?

785
00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.033
It's a little attempt
to celebrate spring.

786
00:37:32.166 --> 00:37:33.700
Toss the rings
and win a prize.

787
00:37:33.834 --> 00:37:34.934
Wonderful.

788
00:37:35.066 --> 00:37:38.333
Well it takes so long for
spring to come around here.

789
00:37:38.467 --> 00:37:41.166
so we like to make a big deal
out of it when it does.

790
00:37:41.834 --> 00:37:44.967
What about your snack there?
You're going to need both hands.

791
00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:46.400
Give me a minute.
I'll be done.

792
00:37:46.533 --> 00:37:47.367
Okay.

793
00:37:48.934 --> 00:37:50.300
Quite impressive.

794
00:37:50.433 --> 00:37:51.367
Okay. Okay.

795
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.800
Hold on. let me uh. help you
out just a touch here.

796
00:37:54.934 --> 00:37:55.800
Oh. we'll give it...

797
00:37:55.934 --> 00:37:58.633
Let me help you out.
just a touch here.

798
00:37:58.767 --> 00:38:01.033
All right. Shall we give it
a try?

799
00:38:01.166 --> 00:38:03.100
Okay. I have to see this.

800
00:38:04.233 --> 00:38:06.200
Use your wrist.
I find that works best.

801
00:38:06.333 --> 00:38:06.934
She's the pro.

802
00:38:07.066 --> 00:38:08.100
You've got to listen to her.

803
00:38:08.233 --> 00:38:09.767
Okay. Here we go.

804
00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:10.900
All right. you got it.

805
00:38:11.033 --> 00:38:11.900
Wish me luck.

806
00:38:12.033 --> 00:38:13.867
Good luck.

807
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.567
Woo! Oh no. the sound
of failure.

808
00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:19.300
Aw. it's close.
You've got it.

809
00:38:19.433 --> 00:38:20.467
You've got to give it
another try.

810
00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:20.967
All right.

811
00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:22.300
Come on. Focus.

812
00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:26.166
I've got this.

813
00:38:27.367 --> 00:38:28.266
Oh!

814
00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.633
Yes. I knew it.

815
00:38:29.767 --> 00:38:31.000
So good.

816
00:38:35.033 --> 00:38:36.567
There you are. Congratulations.

817
00:38:38.433 --> 00:38:40.066
These are pretty.

818
00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:41.467
Thank you.

819
00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:43.433
- Thank you.
- Thank you. That was fun.

820
00:38:43.567 --> 00:38:44.133
Bye!

821
00:38:44.266 --> 00:38:45.166
- You did it.
- I did it.

822
00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:46.400
- You are the champion!
- I am the champion.

823
00:38:46.533 --> 00:38:47.367
How does it feel?

824
00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:49.967
Oh. it feels like
I've always dreamed.

825
00:38:58.767 --> 00:39:00.834
That was so much fun.

826
00:39:00.967 --> 00:39:03.433
I sure would love to go
to the dance.

827
00:39:03.567 --> 00:39:05.467
Well. we still can if we get
rooms for the night.

828
00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:09.500
It's... it's pretty late anyway.
might as well.

829
00:39:09.633 --> 00:39:10.767
There was a darling little
hotel we passed

830
00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:12.967
around the corner earlier.

831
00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:15.600
Let's do it.

832
00:39:15.734 --> 00:39:17.133
Would you mind grabbing
our bags

833
00:39:17.266 --> 00:39:19.200
and I'll meet you at the lobby?

834
00:39:19.333 --> 00:39:20.800
You're not going to run off
on me are you?

835
00:39:20.934 --> 00:39:22.633
I believe you still hold
the keys.

836
00:39:22.767 --> 00:39:24.700
Ah. Okay.

837
00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:34.533
- Hey.
- Hi.

838
00:39:34.667 --> 00:39:36.533
Are you all right?
You seem down.

839
00:39:36.667 --> 00:39:37.567
I'm Amelia.

840
00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:41.100
I played toss while you were
working earlier.

841
00:39:41.233 --> 00:39:43.367
I'm Becca. nice to meet you.

842
00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:44.633
You too.

843
00:39:44.767 --> 00:39:45.834
Do you mind if I?

844
00:39:45.967 --> 00:39:47.033
Yeah.

845
00:39:47.166 --> 00:39:48.667
Thank you.

846
00:39:49.734 --> 00:39:51.700
I remember you.

847
00:39:51.834 --> 00:39:52.800
I like your outfit.

848
00:39:52.934 --> 00:39:56.033
Oh. thank you.

849
00:39:56.166 --> 00:39:58.600
Are you here alone?

850
00:39:58.734 --> 00:40:00.767
I really wanted to go to
the dance after my shift.

851
00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:03.000
but I forgot my dress
back at home

852
00:40:03.133 --> 00:40:05.800
and I can't go looking
like this.

853
00:40:05.934 --> 00:40:07.433
And now the boy I like. Bryson

854
00:40:07.567 --> 00:40:10.133
definitely isn't going to ask me
to dance.

855
00:40:12.166 --> 00:40:14.767
I don't even see a point
in going now.

856
00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:16.967
Listen. I happen to believe

857
00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:20.133
if Bryson wants to ask you
to the dance.

858
00:40:20.266 --> 00:40:22.667
he's not going to care
what you're wearing.

859
00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.633
You think?

860
00:40:27.467 --> 00:40:29.533
Where are you from?

861
00:40:30.767 --> 00:40:32.633
Ah. not from here.

862
00:40:34.633 --> 00:40:36.767
Though. I am just like you.

863
00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:40.500
I just always want people
to see who I truly am.

864
00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:49.166
Come on. I think I may
be able to help.

865
00:40:55.333 --> 00:40:56.066
Where have you been?

866
00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:57.500
I was about to come looking
for you.

867
00:40:57.633 --> 00:41:01.066
Hello. Becca. this is Grady.
my friend.

868
00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.934
- Hi.
- Hey.

869
00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:09.266
Becca was just borrowing
a little something of mine.

870
00:41:12.834 --> 00:41:14.333
Here.

871
00:41:14.467 --> 00:41:17.400
I know I said borrow.
but this is all yours.

872
00:41:17.533 --> 00:41:18.900
Please. take it.

873
00:41:19.033 --> 00:41:20.600
It's so pretty.

874
00:41:20.734 --> 00:41:22.033
I couldn't possibly take it.

875
00:41:22.166 --> 00:41:24.333
It will look even prettier
on you.

876
00:41:24.467 --> 00:41:26.000
And if anything is going
to win Bryson over

877
00:41:26.133 --> 00:41:30.400
besides your wonderful heart.
it will be you in this dress.

878
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.133
Thank you. Amelia. seriously.

879
00:41:35.233 --> 00:41:37.100
Oh. it's okay.

880
00:41:38.066 --> 00:41:39.633
- I love it.
- Oh good.

881
00:41:51.033 --> 00:41:53.433
This is exactly as I imagined
it would be.

882
00:41:53.567 --> 00:41:54.667
It's perfect.

883
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:55.834
Yeah. what is?

884
00:41:55.967 --> 00:41:58.734
Small town dance
in an old barn.

885
00:41:58.867 --> 00:42:01.100
I've never been to a dance
that wasn't in a huge ballroom

886
00:42:01.233 --> 00:42:02.000
with chandeliers and staff

887
00:42:02.133 --> 00:42:04.934
and all sorts of
diplomatic protocols.

888
00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:12.767
Come on. Dance with me.

889
00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:13.700
I don't like to dance.

890
00:42:13.834 --> 00:42:16.767
You promised.
Whatever I want to do.

891
00:42:23.867 --> 00:42:28.900
Isn't that lady a royal?
Like from Europe.

892
00:42:29.033 --> 00:42:32.266

Where'd that come from?

00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:44.233
I don't know.

I said I don't like
to dance.

910
00:43:29.133 --> 00:43:31.033
My ex Emma and I. we took
a bunch of dance lessons

911
00:43:31.166 --> 00:43:33.467

00:44:20.367 --> 00:44:25.133

929
00:44:25.266 --> 00:44:28.033
That was really sweet
by the way.

930
00:44:28.166 --> 00:44:30.567
what you did for them earlier.

931
00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:32.867

you know what love is.

To me that sounds like a risk
worth taking.

935
00:44:41.734 --> 00:44:42.767

Are you staying for long?

Oh no. she's getting away.

We're on a tight schedule.
Please. please back up.

962
00:46:05.834 --> 00:46:07.734
Princess Amelia. please.
just a couple of questions.

963
00:46:07.867 --> 00:46:09.934
If we could just.
just a comment.

964
00:46:10.066 --> 00:46:11.900
Maybe. maybe just a photo.

965
00:46:12.033 --> 00:46:13.567
Just a. just a couple
of questions.

966
00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:18.700
And that was Princess Amelia.

967
00:46:18.834 --> 00:46:21.567
There she goes...
on her way.

968
00:46:28.834 --> 00:46:30.934
Is Amelia coming down?

969
00:46:31.066 --> 00:46:33.333
She's not still feeling ill.
is she?

970
00:46:34.667 --> 00:46:36.800
Amelia's...

971
00:46:36.934 --> 00:46:39.233
Amelia's not...

972
00:46:39.367 --> 00:46:41.600
Amelia's not what exactly?

973
00:46:41.734 --> 00:46:44.700
Amelia's not available.

974
00:46:44.834 --> 00:46:46.567
What do you mean
she's not available?

975
00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:48.433
Where is she?

976
00:46:51.066 --> 00:46:52.133
Amelia went to Chicago.

977
00:46:52.266 --> 00:46:53.533
She left the morning
after the party

978
00:46:53.667 --> 00:46:56.467
so she's probably quite far away
by now.

979
00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:58.066
Chicago?

980
00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:01.133
And you both knew about this?

981
00:47:01.266 --> 00:47:03.200
It was my fault. It was
my responsibility.

982
00:47:03.333 --> 00:47:04.934
Camille wasn't even there
when Amelia left.

983
00:47:05.066 --> 00:47:06.533
I granted permission.

984
00:47:06.667 --> 00:47:08.300
It wasn't your permission
to grant.

985
00:47:08.433 --> 00:47:09.800
She's a grown woman.
dear sister.

986
00:47:09.934 --> 00:47:13.633
It's not yours either.

987
00:47:13.767 --> 00:47:18.100
I'm very disappointed
in you for lying to me. Andreas.

988
00:47:18.233 --> 00:47:19.633
Both of you.

989
00:47:19.767 --> 00:47:21.533
Ava. where are you going?

990
00:47:21.667 --> 00:47:23.133
Ava. your tea's going
to get cold.

991
00:47:23.266 --> 00:47:28.700
She's in great hands with Grady.
I'd trust him with my life.

992
00:47:34.133 --> 00:47:36.200
We might need to find a place
to stay again tonight.

993
00:47:36.333 --> 00:47:37.934
Looks like that storm's coming
right for us.

994
00:47:40.667 --> 00:47:42.033
Wes. Hello.

995
00:47:42.166 --> 00:47:43.633
Amelia. hey.

996
00:47:43.767 --> 00:47:46.166
Look. I'm so sorry it took
so long to call you back.

997
00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:48.667
I just. I've been working
around the clock

998
00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.033
and I left my phone on silent

999
00:47:50.166 --> 00:47:52.467
so as not to disturb my creative
process. and...

1000
00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:55.000
No no. you're totally fine.
I understand.

1001
00:47:55.133 --> 00:47:58.033
I um. we're stuck in the
Colorado mountains though

1002
00:47:58.166 --> 00:48:00.166
and service is a bit spotty.

1003
00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:01.533
We?

1004
00:48:01.667 --> 00:48:03.734
Yes. I'm with my friend Grady.
He's the one driving me there.

1005
00:48:03.867 --> 00:48:06.233
Oh. I don't think you mentioned
a Grady.

1006
00:48:06.367 --> 00:48:08.233
Right.

1007
00:48:08.367 --> 00:48:10.400
He's a friend of my uncle's.

1008
00:48:10.533 --> 00:48:14.166
Anyway. um. we might arrive
later than I said

1009
00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:16.166
in my last voicemail.

1010
00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:17.767
There's a storm coming in.

1011
00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:20.066
I think we're going to need
to find a place to stay.

1012
00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:24.767
Yeah uh. honestly. I've just.
I've been so slammed

1013
00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:26.734
trying to finish these last
few paintings.

1014
00:48:26.867 --> 00:48:28.667
I might not even have much time
to spend with you

1015
00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:30.900
until Wednesday.

1016
00:48:31.033 --> 00:48:32.166
Wednesday.

1017
00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:35.767
Oh. I suppose that works.

1018
00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:37.033
But hey. hey.

1019
00:48:37.166 --> 00:48:39.567
I'm. I'm excited to finally
see you

1020
00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:42.100

1021

1022
00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:45.934
Hello?

00:48:46.066 --> 00:48:49.200
Hello? Hello?

1024
00:48:54.166 --> 00:48:57.333
Not available till Wednesday.
huh?

1025
00:48:57.467 --> 00:49:00.767
Good thing we're rushing
to Chicago.

1026
00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:02.433
I thought you of all people
would understand

1027
00:49:02.567 --> 00:49:04.600
professional obligations.

1028
00:49:22.633 --> 00:49:25.767
Voicemail: Hello. Thanks for
calling. Please leave a message.

1029
00:49:47.133 --> 00:49:47.967
Woah!

1030
00:49:56.066 --> 00:49:58.433
It's really coming down
out there. huh?

1031
00:49:58.567 --> 00:50:00.400
That's spring in Colorado.

1032
00:50:00.533 --> 00:50:03.467
Oh dear. Let me take those
for you.

1033
00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:04.967
I'll put them in the dryer.

1034
00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:07.333
Oh. thank you so much.

1035
00:50:07.467 --> 00:50:09.333
Do you possibly have rooms
available for tonight?

1036
00:50:09.467 --> 00:50:11.266
That we do.
Mr. and Mrs...

1037
00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:12.834
Oh. we're not together.

1038
00:50:12.967 --> 00:50:13.934
He's... he's my driver

1039
00:50:14.066 --> 00:50:17.600
because I don't have an American
license. sadly.

1040
00:50:21.066 --> 00:50:23.000
Well. fortunately we have
two rooms left.

1041
00:50:23.133 --> 00:50:24.767
We'll take them.
Thank you.

1042
00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:28.066
This is my husband. Arnie
and I'm Rosemary.

1043
00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:29.734
You can call me Rosie.

1044
00:50:29.867 --> 00:50:31.600
Both: Just don't call me Mary.

1045
00:50:33.433 --> 00:50:34.266
It's nice to meet you both.

1046
00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:35.800
I'm Amelia and this is Grady.

1047
00:50:35.934 --> 00:50:37.166
- Hi.
- Pleasure.

1048
00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:38.166
Nice to meet you.

1049
00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:39.333
Wonderful to meet you.

1050
00:50:39.467 --> 00:50:41.266
Now you two follow me
and I'll get you settled in.

1051
00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:43.033
Arnie's about to make dinner.

1052
00:50:44.734 --> 00:50:45.767
Great.

1053
00:50:49.934 --> 00:50:51.800
Your room's here.

1054
00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:59.000
Oh my.

1055
00:50:59.133 --> 00:51:02.834
This quilt is spectacular.

1056
00:51:04.433 --> 00:51:06.200
So soft.

1057
00:51:06.333 --> 00:51:07.700
Thank you.

1058
00:51:07.834 --> 00:51:09.467
I crocheted it myself.

1059
00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.000
You did.

1060
00:51:11.133 --> 00:51:12.633
That's impressive.

1061
00:51:12.767 --> 00:51:14.700
Holler if you need me.

1062
00:51:45.533 --> 00:51:47.266
Sorry!

1063
00:52:09.667 --> 00:52:11.266
I like your shirt.

1064
00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:13.433
It looks even better on. huh?

1065
00:52:16.767 --> 00:52:18.166
There we go.

1066
00:52:20.433 --> 00:52:22.367
So. where are your
other guests?

1067
00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:25.066
Just one other couple.
but they retired early

1068
00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:27.133
so it looks like it's just
us for dinner.

1069
00:52:27.266 --> 00:52:28.400
Well. it smells wonderful.

1070
00:52:28.533 --> 00:52:31.367
This is my famous baked
barbecue chicken

1071
00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:34.233
with corn on the cob.
hot garlic mash.

1072
00:52:34.367 --> 00:52:38.567
and a tasty farm fresh spring
salad right from our garden.

1073
00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:40.233
Bon appetit.

1074
00:52:40.367 --> 00:52:42.867
Thank you so much for this.
This is. um...

1075
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.033
Heavenly. Really.

1076
00:52:45.166 --> 00:52:46.300
I know.

1077
00:52:46.433 --> 00:52:48.300
He makes it hard for me
to keep my figure.

1078
00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:53.033
How long have you been
together?

1079
00:52:53.166 --> 00:52:56.266
Our life story spans
nearly 50 years.

1080
00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:57.266
In fact...

1081
00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:59.266
The big 5-0 is next year.

1082
00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:01.500
That's so sweet.

1083
00:53:01.633 --> 00:53:03.867
- Rosie.
- Hm?

1084
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:07.700
How did you know that Arnie
was the one?

1085
00:53:07.834 --> 00:53:10.967
Guess it was love
at first sight.

1086
00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:12.934
And now here we are.

1087
00:53:13.066 --> 00:53:16.767
Three kids. four grandkids.
a lifetime later.

1088
00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:21.133
But my Rosie still steals every
room she steps into.

1089
00:53:36.967 --> 00:53:40.133
Now do you believe in love
at first sight?

1090
00:53:40.266 --> 00:53:41.333
Maybe it was for them.

1091
00:53:41.467 --> 00:53:45.166
Or... but like maybe they didn't
realize it was true love

1092
00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:49.533
until like. way further down
the road.

1093
00:53:49.667 --> 00:53:50.867
I wonder how long
they've been bouncing off

1094
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.533
each other's sentences.

1095
00:53:52.667 --> 00:53:54.500
Please. You and I
already do that.

1096
00:53:54.633 --> 00:53:55.800
It's old news.

1097
00:53:55.934 --> 00:53:58.200
That's true.

1098
00:54:02.967 --> 00:54:06.133
Did you have that with Emma?

1099
00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:12.367
Emma and I didn't even speak
the same language.

1100
00:54:14.066 --> 00:54:17.266
Have you spoken since it ended?

1101
00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:20.767
She tried calling once.

1102
00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:22.667
I didn't answer.

1103
00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:23.934
I figured...

1104
00:54:24.066 --> 00:54:28.667
if I did I probably would've
said something I regret. so.

1105
00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:32.233
I admire that about you.

1106
00:54:32.367 --> 00:54:36.066
How you always think
before you speak.

1107
00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:41.400
Well. I admire how you always
say exactly what you feel.

1108
00:54:41.533 --> 00:54:46.367
Just be cautious when it comes
to your heart.

1109
00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:48.767
You're worried about my heart?

1110
00:54:50.533 --> 00:54:52.567
I'm here to protect you.
aren't I?

1111
00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:56.400
Not that you need it.

1112
00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:04.867
I should probably get to bed.

1113
00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:11.600
Yeah.

1114
00:55:30.533 --> 00:55:32.633
It must take forever to do one.

1115
00:55:32.767 --> 00:55:35.767
Anything made with love
takes time.

1116
00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:38.033
Well. the one on my bed
is far comfier to sleep

1117
00:55:38.166 --> 00:55:41.867
under than my 1.000 thread count
silk sheets from Monaco.

1118
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:46.367
Monaco silk?
Sounds fancy.

1119
00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:50.266
Where you kids headed
to anyhow?

1120
00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:51.633
To Chicago.

1121
00:55:51.767 --> 00:55:52.934
Ah.

1122
00:55:53.066 --> 00:55:55.400
Though I wouldn't mind at all
staying here a while longer.

1123
00:55:55.533 --> 00:55:57.900
It's been great having you.

1124
00:55:58.033 --> 00:55:59.967
We don't get many visitors now

1125
00:56:00.166 --> 00:56:03.767
since they put the new freeway
below the mountain.

1126
00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:08.000
Actually. we'll probably have
to sell next year.

1127
00:56:08.133 --> 00:56:09.800
Property taxes.

1128
00:56:09.934 --> 00:56:11.700
We can't keep up anymore.

1129
00:56:11.834 --> 00:56:14.467
Rosie. I am so sorry.

1130
00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:18.467
This place. this is your home.

1131
00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:22.367
Home is with Arnie.

1132
00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:25.600
A house is just a place to be.

1133
00:56:25.734 --> 00:56:30.734
That one there? He seems
pretty sweet on you.

1134
00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:34.667
Hmm?

1135
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.133
Hold on now.

1136
00:56:42.266 --> 00:56:44.533
Don't forget this.

1137
00:56:44.667 --> 00:56:47.300
Oh. no Rosie.
I couldn't possibly.

1138
00:56:47.433 --> 00:56:51.133
It's just something
to remember us by.

1139
00:56:51.266 --> 00:56:52.934
Well. thank you.

1140
00:56:53.066 --> 00:56:54.867
And I have something
for you too.

1141
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.834
but don't open it just yet.

1142
00:56:56.967 --> 00:56:57.967
Once we leave.

1143
00:56:58.100 --> 00:56:59.500
Oh!

1144
00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:02.100
Thank you.

1145
00:57:03.133 --> 00:57:04.533
Arnie. Thank you.

1146
00:57:04.667 --> 00:57:06.734
Sandwiches for the road.
These look amazing.

1147
00:57:06.867 --> 00:57:07.767
You're a master chef.

1148
00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:09.867
You should sample it
before you say that.

1149
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.600
Thank you.

1150
00:57:21.333 --> 00:57:24.033
Those two are going to
end up together.

1151
00:57:24.166 --> 00:57:25.066
don't you think?

1152
00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:27.033
I sure hope so.

1153
00:57:27.166 --> 00:57:28.967
Let's see what this is.

1154
00:57:29.633 --> 00:57:30.467
Huh.

1155
00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:36.533
Oh. my gosh.

1156
00:57:36.667 --> 00:57:38.367
Look at this.

1157
00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:40.667
"I believe I was given these
so I could do something

1158
00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:42.934
truly special with them
someday."

1159
00:57:43.066 --> 00:57:48.166
"Keep this
place so I can come back
on my next adventure."

1160
00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:50.433
"Amelia."

1161
00:58:00.433 --> 00:58:01.333
Voicemail: Amelia dear.

1162
00:58:01.467 --> 00:58:03.000
This is your mother.
and I am very worried.

1163
00:58:03.133 --> 00:58:05.100
and very angry with you.

1164
00:58:05.233 --> 00:58:06.133
Call me back.

1165
00:58:08.367 --> 00:58:09.734
Voicemail: Amelia.
it's me again.

1166
00:58:09.867 --> 00:58:11.667
We are en route to Chicago
tomorrow morning

1167
00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:14.000
and I would like it
if you would...

1168
00:58:16.266 --> 00:58:17.734
You all right?

1169
00:58:17.867 --> 00:58:21.300
Yes. I'll be fine thanks.

1170
00:58:21.433 --> 00:58:25.266
I suppose Chicago is the last
place I want to go now.

1171
00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:31.000
Or maybe you should meet with
Wes before you see your mom.

1172
00:58:31.133 --> 00:58:34.233
I mean you don't want to be
in the wrong headspace

1173
00:58:34.367 --> 00:58:38.333
reuniting with him after
you've come so far.

1174
00:58:38.467 --> 00:58:41.133
I guess we take our time now.

1175
00:58:48.734 --> 00:58:52.567
Where did you say you were
from originally?

1176
00:58:52.700 --> 00:58:53.900
Nebraska.

1177
00:58:54.033 --> 00:58:57.233
Why don't we swing by there
so I can see where you grew up?

1178
00:58:57.367 --> 00:58:59.100
I don't know.

1179
00:58:59.233 --> 00:59:02.133
I haven't been back in a while.

1180
00:59:02.266 --> 00:59:05.233
If your father has been upset
with you.

1181
00:59:05.367 --> 00:59:08.233
maybe it's time to see him
in person.

1182
00:59:08.367 --> 00:59:12.200
Make things right.

1183
00:59:12.333 --> 00:59:15.300
Fine. Fine.

1184
00:59:15.433 --> 00:59:17.133
I'll text my mother.

1185
00:59:17.266 --> 00:59:20.300
See if she's around
so we can swing by.

1186
00:59:26.834 --> 00:59:31.200
♪ Ohhh

1187
00:59:31.333 --> 00:59:32.834
I love this song.

1188
00:59:35.433 --> 00:59:40.900
♪ The first day of
the rest of our lives ♪

1189
00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:56.834
♪ Yeah this could be.
this could be ♪

1190
00:59:56.967 --> 00:59:58.667
♪ The first day of
the rest of our lives ♪

1191
00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.700
My mother must be so upset
with Camille and Uncle Andreas.

1192
01:00:01.934 --> 01:00:04.367
I feel bad getting them
wrapped up in all this.

1193
01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:08.300
It was pretty brave of your
uncle to let you come like this.

1194
01:00:08.433 --> 01:00:11.667
Yes. I've always been in awe
of my uncle.

1195
01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:15.700
Unlike my mother. he was
the rebel of the family.

1196
01:00:15.834 --> 01:00:19.900
Yeah. How so?

1197
01:00:20.033 --> 01:00:23.633
He just had little patience
for the aristocracy

1198
01:00:23.767 --> 01:00:25.967
and it was brave of him
to come out publicly

1199
01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:27.333
at such a young age.

1200
01:00:27.467 --> 01:00:29.567
Oh. I'm sure
when you are queen

1201
01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:32.467
you will be a trailblazer
as well.

1202
01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:33.667
You think?

1203
01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:37.367
I've seen the effect you have
on everyone you meet.

1204
01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.734
It's amazing.

1205
01:00:41.433 --> 01:00:42.633
Well...

1206
01:00:42.767 --> 01:00:45.033
I sure hope so.

1207
01:00:47.333 --> 01:00:48.700
Can I see?

1208
01:00:48.834 --> 01:00:51.467
It's. it's old.
It's a film camera.

1209
01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:53.066
It was my dad's.

1210
01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:55.567
He says everything looks better
on film.

1211
01:00:58.133 --> 01:01:01.800
Do you think my eyes
are sad?

1212
01:01:01.934 --> 01:01:04.066
When Wes painted my portrait

1213
01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:07.266
he said my eyes were sad
or something.

1214
01:01:13.233 --> 01:01:15.233
No.

1215
01:01:15.367 --> 01:01:19.400
No. I don't think your eyes
are sad at all.

1216
01:01:19.533 --> 01:01:21.667
I think they're beautiful.

1217
01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:29.033
If we had time.

1218
01:01:29.166 --> 01:01:33.100
there are places in America
I would love to show you.

1219
01:01:33.233 --> 01:01:38.734
Well. maybe we could just keep
on driving.

1220
01:01:38.867 --> 01:01:39.867
Hey!

1221
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.800
You're on private property.

1222
01:01:41.934 --> 01:01:43.633
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

1223
01:01:43.767 --> 01:01:47.600
Sorry! Woah. okay.
We gotta go.

1224
01:01:47.734 --> 01:01:48.900
Sorry man.

1225
01:01:49.033 --> 01:01:50.400
Okay gotta go. Gotta go.

1226
01:01:53.667 --> 01:01:54.400
Sorry!

1227
01:01:54.533 --> 01:01:55.767
Sorry. sorry. so sorry!

1228
01:02:13.066 --> 01:02:14.700
Grady.

1229
01:02:14.834 --> 01:02:16.800
Hi Mom.

1230
01:02:16.934 --> 01:02:19.300
Oh!

1231
01:02:19.433 --> 01:02:21.800
It's so good to have you home.

1232
01:02:21.934 --> 01:02:24.300
It's been far too long
since you were here.

1233
01:02:24.433 --> 01:02:26.133
I know. I'm sorry my schedule's
been so crazy.

1234
01:02:26.266 --> 01:02:27.000
Hello.

1235
01:02:27.133 --> 01:02:27.967
This is Amelia.

1236
01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:30.033
Hello.

1237
01:02:30.166 --> 01:02:33.000
- Hey Dad.
- Hey son.

1238
01:02:33.133 --> 01:02:34.533
It's good to see you.
It's been a while.

1239
01:02:34.667 --> 01:02:36.834
It has.

1240
01:02:36.967 --> 01:02:38.800
So. how was the drive?

1241
01:02:38.934 --> 01:02:39.533
It's been uh...

1242
01:02:39.667 --> 01:02:40.867
Quite the adventure really.

1243
01:02:42.667 --> 01:02:43.700
Oh. well.

1244
01:02:43.834 --> 01:02:46.433
Let's get you kids inside
and show you to your rooms.

1245
01:02:46.567 --> 01:02:47.600
I'll take that.

1246
01:02:47.734 --> 01:02:48.934
Your dad's fired up the grill

1247
01:02:49.066 --> 01:02:51.333
so we're having a cheeseburger
night tonight.

1248
01:02:51.467 --> 01:02:54.266
- Oh. with American cheese?
- Whatever kind you want. dear.

1249
01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:58.033
Hello Camille.
Have you arrived in Chicago yet?

1250
01:02:58.166 --> 01:03:00.367
Yes. You're not here yet?

1251
01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:02.166
No. I'm in Nebraska.

1252
01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:06.533
I'm staying at Grady's parents ranch.

1253
01:03:06.667 --> 01:03:10.000
How's mother? Is she
still enraged?

1254
01:03:10.133 --> 01:03:11.300
I haven't seen her.

1255
01:03:11.433 --> 01:03:14.166
She hasn't dined with us since
she found out you were gone.

1256
01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:16.900
I'm so sorry for any trouble
I caused.

1257
01:03:17.033 --> 01:03:21.734
Stop. I'm so proud of you.

1258
01:03:21.867 --> 01:03:24.433
You deserve this trip.
remember that.

1259
01:03:24.567 --> 01:03:26.367
Thank you.

1260
01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:27.667
I don't think we'll arrive
in Chicago

1261
01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:31.266
until late tomorrow evening.
but please don't tell mother.

1262
01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:33.834
I want to see Wes
before I face her.

1263
01:03:33.967 --> 01:03:36.333
- Of course.
- Okay.

1264
01:03:36.467 --> 01:03:37.433
I'll talk to you later.

1265
01:03:37.567 --> 01:03:39.467
- -Good-
- Bye.
- Bye.

1266
01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:45.433
- Hey.
- Hey Dad.

1267
01:03:47.734 --> 01:03:49.100
Can I give you a hand?

1268
01:03:49.233 --> 01:03:50.700
Sure. you can help me
flip these.

1269
01:03:50.834 --> 01:03:53.333
All right.

1270
01:03:53.467 --> 01:03:55.667
I didn't get a chance
to tell you how sorry I am

1271
01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:58.266
about the way things ended
with Emma.

1272
01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.767
I know you really cared
about her.

1273
01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:05.066
I know now leaving with her
was probably a mistake.

1274
01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:08.667
Ah. making a sacrifice
for someone you love?

1275
01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:12.467
That's never a mistake.

1276
01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:15.300
I'm sorry also.

1277
01:04:15.433 --> 01:04:17.934
Up and leaving so quick
the way I did.

1278
01:04:18.066 --> 01:04:22.000
That's all in the past.

1279
01:04:22.133 --> 01:04:23.333
Now. my feelings were hurt
for a while

1280
01:04:23.467 --> 01:04:26.066
but I had to remind myself

1281
01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:32.066
that this ranch is my dream.
not yours.

1282
01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:34.033
And you need to make
your own way.

1283
01:04:36.533 --> 01:04:37.834
Thank you.

1284
01:04:39.633 --> 01:04:40.934
Thank you.

1285
01:04:42.367 --> 01:04:44.333
Here comes the fixins. boys.

1286
01:04:44.467 --> 01:04:46.433
Great. and these are just
about done.

1287
01:04:46.567 --> 01:04:48.200
Let's eat.

1288
01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:52.700
- That one looks good.
- Yeah.

1289
01:04:56.767 --> 01:04:58.567
Your home is amazing.

1290
01:04:58.700 --> 01:04:59.967
How long have you lived here?

1291
01:05:00.166 --> 01:05:02.533
Since Grady was a boy.

1292
01:05:02.667 --> 01:05:04.700
We inherited it from
my grandfather.

1293
01:05:04.834 --> 01:05:06.300
Needed a lot of work
over the years.

1294
01:05:06.433 --> 01:05:08.900
We just finished fixing up
the stable.

1295
01:05:09.033 --> 01:05:10.033
You ever ride a horse?

1296
01:05:10.166 --> 01:05:11.166
She has.

1297
01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:12.867
I think she might have
stolen one at one point...

1298
01:05:14.367 --> 01:05:16.033
It was my mother's.

1299
01:05:16.166 --> 01:05:18.467
Grady. I can't believe
you told your parents that.

1300
01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:19.500
We don't mind.

1301
01:05:19.633 --> 01:05:21.867
Grady was a pretty mischievous
kid himself.

1302
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.734
Just don't steal my horse
and you'll be just fine.

1303
01:05:25.867 --> 01:05:28.834
Now. if you've gotta take one.
take Pat's.

1304
01:05:28.967 --> 01:05:31.333
I didn't slave over a hot grill
for an hour

1305
01:05:31.467 --> 01:05:33.333
to take this kind of abuse.
okay?

1306
01:05:38.033 --> 01:05:39.367
Is it everything you imagined?

1307
01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:42.567
Mm. this burger is the best
thing I've ever tasted.

1308
01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:43.834
Be still my heart.

1309
01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:46.333
I like this one.

1310
01:05:46.467 --> 01:05:49.300
She knows good food.

1311
01:05:49.433 --> 01:05:53.166
So. Amelia...

1312
01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:56.667
what is this Chicago quest
all about?

1313
01:05:58.266 --> 01:06:05.266
Um. there's a man there
that I met at home.

1314
01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:07.633
We sort of fell for each other.

1315
01:06:09.834 --> 01:06:11.834
Now I want to see him.

1316
01:06:13.867 --> 01:06:16.467
So. you going to tell him
how you feel?

1317
01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:17.367
Mom.

1318
01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:20.433
Well. it's just a friendly question.

1319
01:06:24.033 --> 01:06:26.033
Actually. I don't know.

1320
01:06:26.166 --> 01:06:29.867
Well. I didn't even like Pat
when he and I first met.

1321
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.100
I mean. we just had all the same
friends back then.

1322
01:06:32.233 --> 01:06:35.533
but he made me crazy.

1323
01:06:35.667 --> 01:06:38.066
And then he made me laugh.

1324
01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:41.600
even when he's being
a big stick in the mud.

1325
01:06:41.734 --> 01:06:45.600
And then we sorta grew
on each other.

1326
01:06:45.734 --> 01:06:48.467
And then we grew together

1327
01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:51.533
and one day I just realized
that's it.

1328
01:06:51.667 --> 01:06:54.233
there's no one else.

1329
01:06:54.367 --> 01:06:56.633
And that's when it set in
for me.

1330
01:06:56.767 --> 01:06:58.600
It's not what you set sight on
with your eyes.

1331
01:06:58.734 --> 01:07:03.200
it's what I set sight on
with my heart.

1332
01:07:07.734 --> 01:07:09.834
Here's to seeing
with your heart.

1333
01:07:24.133 --> 01:07:25.500
Gus here.

1334
01:07:25.633 --> 01:07:28.867
He was real sad
when I moved to LA.

1335
01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.834
Until Mom adopted Miss Daffodil
to keep him company.

1336
01:07:32.967 --> 01:07:36.166
Sometimes I wonder
what my life would be like

1337
01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:39.300
if I hadn't given up everything
here in Nebraska.

1338
01:07:40.767 --> 01:07:42.533
You didn't give up anything. Grady.

1339
01:07:42.667 --> 01:07:44.667
You can have the life you want.

1340
01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:47.367
You going to hold
yourself to that?

1341
01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:50.533
At first. I thought I was
just running towards Wes.

1342
01:07:50.667 --> 01:07:55.633
but now I kind of wonder if what
I've been running towards is me.

1343
01:08:01.633 --> 01:08:03.667
We should probably get going.

1344
01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:05.767
Okay.

1345
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:30.133
Amelia. you are always welcome
back here.

1346
01:08:30.266 --> 01:08:30.967
Thank you.

1347
01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:32.400
And you. mister.

1348
01:08:34.333 --> 01:08:35.667
If you can possibly get
back down

1349
01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:39.400
for the anniversary barbecue.
please do.

1350
01:08:39.533 --> 01:08:40.900
I'll try.

1351
01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:45.900
I love you. son.

1352
01:08:46.033 --> 01:08:47.900
I love you too. Dad.

1353
01:08:48.033 --> 01:08:49.233
Come back soon.

1354
01:08:49.367 --> 01:08:52.300
Never this long
without visiting again.

1355
01:08:52.433 --> 01:08:53.233
Thank you so much.

1356
01:08:53.367 --> 01:08:55.000
It was such a pleasure
meeting you both.

1357
01:08:55.133 --> 01:08:56.734
You too.

1358
01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:01.100
You've raised a very good man.
you know.

1359
01:09:01.233 --> 01:09:02.367
We know.

1360
01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:08.600
All right. See you soon.

1361
01:09:08.734 --> 01:09:10.233
Love you guys.

1362
01:09:11.333 --> 01:09:12.734
I guess I'll get the bags?

1363
01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:15.367
Thanks.

1364
01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:16.300
I can help.

1365
01:09:16.433 --> 01:09:17.967
Thank you.

1366
01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:20.000
Okay. bye!

1367
01:09:46.867 --> 01:09:50.467
♪ This isn't a song
of surrender ♪

1368
01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:52.600
♪ This is a song of
hope ♪

1369
01:09:52.734 --> 01:09:54.233
Pretty amazing. isn't it?

1370
01:09:54.367 --> 01:09:56.100
I've always loved Chicago.

1371
01:09:56.233 --> 01:09:59.533
You have got to take your
picture under the big bean.

1372
01:09:59.667 --> 01:10:00.600
Yeah.

1373
01:10:00.734 --> 01:10:02.567
I'd like that.

1374
01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:05.200
Hey. you all right?

1375
01:10:05.333 --> 01:10:08.100
You've been quiet ever since
we left Nebraska.

1376
01:10:08.233 --> 01:10:11.533
Yeah. I'm fine.
I'm just thinking.

1377
01:10:11.667 --> 01:10:13.567
About you and Wes?

1378
01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:17.600
Aren't you excited to see him?

1379
01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:21.567
Yeah. of course.

1380
01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:26.633
It's just too bad this part
is coming to an end.

1381
01:10:26.767 --> 01:10:29.233
The uncertainty of what's next.

1382
01:10:33.166 --> 01:10:35.934
For what it's worth...

1383
01:10:36.066 --> 01:10:38.700
I admire you.

1384
01:10:38.834 --> 01:10:40.867
Finding your way out here.

1385
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.800
putting your heart on the line.

1386
01:10:42.934 --> 01:10:44.600
Takes courage.

1387
01:10:47.734 --> 01:10:49.767
Thank you. Grady.

1388
01:10:55.867 --> 01:10:57.767
And you?

1389
01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:00.367
What will you do next?

1390
01:11:01.533 --> 01:11:04.100
Probably swing back
by my parents' place.

1391
01:11:04.233 --> 01:11:06.600
Join them for their anniversary
party on Friday.

1392
01:11:06.734 --> 01:11:09.066
It'll be 35 years for them.

1393
01:11:10.934 --> 01:11:12.834
Sounds lovely.

1394
01:11:27.467 --> 01:11:30.633
Amelia still isn't answering
my calls.

1395
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.133
Am I a bad mother?

1396
01:11:35.266 --> 01:11:41.700
No. ma'am. you are
a great mother.

1397
01:11:41.834 --> 01:11:47.834
I just think that you care
too much.

1398
01:11:47.967 --> 01:11:49.600
But this trip was never
about you

1399
01:11:49.734 --> 01:11:51.934
or anything that you've done.

1400
01:11:52.066 --> 01:11:55.667
It's about her having
a moment for herself.

1401
01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:58.200
Amelia is going to be
a strong woman.

1402
01:11:58.333 --> 01:12:02.700
and that's because of you.

1403
01:12:02.834 --> 01:12:05.433
But respectfully.

1404
01:12:05.567 --> 01:12:07.900
you can't keep her under
lock and key forever.

1405
01:12:08.033 --> 01:12:11.567
That was never my intention.

1406
01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:15.033
I only want her to stop seeing
the world so innocently.

1407
01:12:15.166 --> 01:12:16.166
Yes.

1408
01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:19.900
But in order for that she needs
to see the world.

1409
01:12:23.066 --> 01:12:25.033
I don't want to lose her.

1410
01:12:25.166 --> 01:12:27.200
Well...

1411
01:12:27.333 --> 01:12:32.233
It's lucky for you then
that she loves you dearly.

1412
01:12:32.367 --> 01:12:34.767
So that'll never happen.

1413
01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:49.367
Guess this is it. huh?

1414
01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:52.400
Yeah. I guess so.

1415
01:12:52.533 --> 01:12:56.500
I'll drop your bags off
at the hotel for you.

1416
01:12:56.633 --> 01:12:58.900
Are you sure you don't want me
to stick around?

1417
01:12:59.033 --> 01:13:01.233
No. I'll be fine thanks.

1418
01:13:01.367 --> 01:13:05.200
Plus. I've taken up enough
of your vacation as it is.

1419
01:13:09.367 --> 01:13:11.734
Maybe I'll see you in LA?

1420
01:13:11.867 --> 01:13:14.300
Not sure I'll make it back
in time.

1421
01:13:14.433 --> 01:13:17.934
Let's be honest.
things go well with Wes

1422
01:13:18.066 --> 01:13:21.467
you might not return
to LA at all.

1423
01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:24.834
Well. I do hope
I see you again

1424
01:13:24.967 --> 01:13:29.567
in some capacity. someday.

1425
01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:31.867
Me too.

1426
01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:41.467
Amelia. hey!

1427
01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:42.433
You made it.

1428
01:13:42.567 --> 01:13:44.433
Wes!

1429
01:13:44.567 --> 01:13:48.166
This is my bodyguard. Grady.
Grady. this is Wes.

1430
01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:51.734
- Hey.
- Hey. Nice to meet you.

1431
01:13:51.867 --> 01:13:53.934
Okay. I was just heading out.

1432
01:13:54.066 --> 01:13:55.233
I'm glad to see she's
in good hands.

1433
01:13:55.367 --> 01:13:56.767
Thanks for getting her here
in one piece.

1434
01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:58.266
Yeah.

1435
01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:01.633
Okay. See you around.

1436
01:14:01.767 --> 01:14:04.333
Bye.

1437
01:14:04.467 --> 01:14:06.834
Come on up. I'll show
you around...

1438
01:14:33.166 --> 01:14:34.800
Really is great to see you.

1439
01:14:34.934 --> 01:14:38.200
And thank you for coming
all this way.

1440
01:14:38.333 --> 01:14:40.667
You look beautiful
by the way.

1441
01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:42.967
Thank you.

1442
01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:45.166
This is so amazing

1443
01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:47.967
to see all your work presented
here so wonderfully.

1444
01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:49.333
Thank you.

1445
01:14:49.467 --> 01:14:53.467
So. tell me more
about this road trip.

1446
01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:55.033
Well. we went camping

1447
01:14:55.166 --> 01:14:57.500
and I got to try s'mores.

1448
01:14:57.633 --> 01:14:59.333
Then we found this
spring festival in Utah

1449
01:14:59.467 --> 01:15:00.834
which was lovely.

1450
01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:03.400
I got stuck in a storm
in Colorado

1451
01:15:03.533 --> 01:15:04.500
and this morning

1452
01:15:04.633 --> 01:15:06.533
I got to go horse riding
on a ranch in Nebraska.

1453
01:15:06.667 --> 01:15:08.834
Wow. Sounds like fun.

1454
01:15:08.967 --> 01:15:10.834
I don't think I've camped
since college.

1455
01:15:10.967 --> 01:15:13.533
Well. I'm a pro now
so I'll take you.

1456
01:15:13.667 --> 01:15:16.066
Sorry. I guess I'm just
a lot more focused

1457
01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:18.367
on my work these days.

1458
01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:21.800
Speaking of. let me show you
my latest piece.

1459
01:15:24.867 --> 01:15:27.033
I just finished this
last night.

1460
01:15:27.166 --> 01:15:29.000
It's wonderful.

1461
01:15:29.133 --> 01:15:32.200
They look so serene.

1462
01:15:32.333 --> 01:15:36.834
It was a gift from the husband
for their wedding anniversary.

1463
01:15:36.967 --> 01:15:40.333
They remind me of a couple
we met on the road.

1464
01:15:40.467 --> 01:15:42.567
How long have they
been married?

1465
01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:45.333
Uh. you know I never thought
to ask.

1466
01:15:45.467 --> 01:15:48.900
I guess for me it's. it's mostly
about the moment.

1467
01:15:49.033 --> 01:15:52.700
not necessarily the stories
behind the subjects.

1468
01:15:54.333 --> 01:15:57.400
Was that the case when you
painted my portrait?

1469
01:15:57.533 --> 01:16:00.066
What? No. I...

1470
01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:01.433
Excuse me.

1471
01:16:01.567 --> 01:16:04.100
Are you Princess Amelia
of Bundbury?

1472
01:16:04.233 --> 01:16:04.867
I am.

1473
01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.333
Could we take a photo with you?

1474
01:16:06.467 --> 01:16:07.867
Of course.

1475
01:16:10.567 --> 01:16:12.900
Would you mind taking it?

1476
01:16:13.033 --> 01:16:14.100
Uh. yeah. Of course.

1477
01:16:21.367 --> 01:16:22.834
- Thank you.
- No problem.

1478
01:16:22.967 --> 01:16:23.500
Thank you so much.

1479
01:16:23.633 --> 01:16:25.033
You're welcome.

1480
01:16:28.467 --> 01:16:33.066
Well. you attract attention
even here.

1481
01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:34.100
If I'd have known

1482
01:16:34.233 --> 01:16:36.667
I would've included
your portrait in the show

1483
01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:39.266
You know. maybe we should
go outside

1484
01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:41.433
and take some photos
with the media.

1485
01:16:41.567 --> 01:16:43.834
Could be good press
for the both of us.

1486
01:16:43.967 --> 01:16:45.600
What do you think?

1487
01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:54.667
Have you ever been
in love. Wes?

1488
01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:55.800
Of course.

1489
01:16:55.934 --> 01:16:57.800
But would you move.

1490
01:16:57.934 --> 01:17:01.233
change your life.
for someone you love?

1491
01:17:01.367 --> 01:17:06.500
Well. I mean. I've worked
so hard to establish myself
in Chicago.

1492
01:17:06.633 --> 01:17:10.300
It's where my art
and my heart thrives.

1493
01:17:10.433 --> 01:17:13.834
I'm sorry. I don't really see
where this is going.

1494
01:17:13.967 --> 01:17:16.000
Right.

1495
01:17:16.133 --> 01:17:18.200
Me neither.

1496
01:17:19.166 --> 01:17:20.300
I should leave.

1497
01:17:20.433 --> 01:17:21.667
Leave?

1498
01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:23.200
What do you mean?
You just got here.

1499
01:17:23.333 --> 01:17:25.867
Yes. and I never
would've come here

1500
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.700
if it hadn't been for you.

1501
01:17:27.834 --> 01:17:30.734
But if you'll excuse me.

1502
01:17:30.867 --> 01:17:34.900
there's something
I must make right.

1503
01:17:55.567 --> 01:17:57.000
You waited up for me.

1504
01:17:57.133 --> 01:17:59.567
Of course.

1505
01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:02.667
Plus. your father was snoring
so I couldn't sleep.

1506
01:18:09.467 --> 01:18:12.133
It didn't turn out so well.
huh?

1507
01:18:12.266 --> 01:18:15.567
I can see it in your face.

1508
01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:19.600
You went and fell in love
with a princess. didn't you?

1509
01:18:19.734 --> 01:18:20.266
I mean. how did...

1510
01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:23.300
A mother always knows.

1511
01:18:23.433 --> 01:18:27.000
Plus. I looked her up.
so there's that.

1512
01:18:27.133 --> 01:18:29.233
You know what else a mother
also always knows?

1513
01:18:29.367 --> 01:18:30.467
Hmm?

1514
01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:33.967
That if it's true love.
it'll find its way back to you.

1515
01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:35.100
Even if you weren't
brave enough

1516
01:18:35.233 --> 01:18:39.834
to actually tell the person
that you love them?

1517
01:18:39.967 --> 01:18:43.600
If she has any sense at all.
and I think she does.

1518
01:18:43.734 --> 01:18:47.467
she already knows.

1519
01:18:52.934 --> 01:18:54.166
Camille. I...

1520
01:18:58.033 --> 01:19:00.200
Amelia.

1521
01:19:00.333 --> 01:19:02.800
I'm sorry mother.
that I left

1522
01:19:02.934 --> 01:19:08.033
and I didn't return any of your
calls. and I worried you so.

1523
01:19:08.166 --> 01:19:10.700
I truly am.

1524
01:19:10.834 --> 01:19:14.033
And you were right about Wes.

1525
01:19:14.166 --> 01:19:16.500
He isn't the one for me.

1526
01:19:16.633 --> 01:19:18.166
I'm so sorry. dear.

1527
01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:19.467
But that being said.

1528
01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:21.734
you cannot protect me
my entire life

1529
01:19:21.867 --> 01:19:25.700
simply hoping I will avoid
being hurt.

1530
01:19:25.834 --> 01:19:27.633
You're right.

1531
01:19:27.767 --> 01:19:32.734
After losing your father
I've... I've held on too tight.

1532
01:19:35.967 --> 01:19:39.667
I understand. I know.

1533
01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:43.800
But I'm not going anywhere.
and I would never give up

1534
01:19:43.934 --> 01:19:47.166
my responsibilities of wearing
the Crown.

1535
01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:51.800
I don't think anyone who truly
loved me would expect me to.

1536
01:19:51.934 --> 01:19:54.000
Of course.

1537
01:19:55.767 --> 01:20:02.233
So. tell me.
how was America?

1538
01:20:02.367 --> 01:20:05.333
It was like I always
imagined it.

1539
01:20:05.467 --> 01:20:10.200
And thanks to Grady
I've never had such fun.

1540
01:20:10.333 --> 01:20:15.000
He really was
the perfect partner.

1541
01:20:15.133 --> 01:20:18.300
He's very special
and the funny thing is.

1542
01:20:18.433 --> 01:20:21.834
he doesn't know it.

1543
01:20:21.967 --> 01:20:24.266
You didn't want it to end.
did you?

1544
01:20:26.967 --> 01:20:32.400
Hmm. well then.
You best get to it.

1545
01:20:34.033 --> 01:20:35.000
What?

1546
01:20:35.133 --> 01:20:37.166
Go.

1547
01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:38.567
See this wonderful man

1548
01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:42.800
both you and your uncle speak
so highly of.

1549
01:20:42.934 --> 01:20:45.533
Finish your big adventure. dear.

1550
01:20:47.834 --> 01:20:48.934
But the Crown.

1551
01:20:49.066 --> 01:20:53.734
Will be safe and sound
until you are good and ready.

1552
01:20:53.867 --> 01:20:56.500
But Mother.

1553
01:20:56.633 --> 01:20:59.667
I don't know if he feels
the same way.

1554
01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:04.767
Well. you'll never know
if you don't tell him.

1555
01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:05.934
Go.

1556
01:21:25.433 --> 01:21:26.800
Thank you.

1557
01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:36.734
Amelia?

1558
01:21:36.867 --> 01:21:37.633
Hello.

1559
01:21:37.767 --> 01:21:41.033
It's so good to have you
back again!

1560
01:21:41.166 --> 01:21:42.400
Happy Anniversary!

1561
01:21:42.533 --> 01:21:44.200
I knew you'd come back
for our festivities.

1562
01:21:44.333 --> 01:21:46.867
I brought some supplies.
some fixins.

1563
01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.400
But I know it's not much.

1564
01:21:48.533 --> 01:21:49.800
Thank you. it looks great.

1565
01:21:49.934 --> 01:21:50.834
Please.

1566
01:21:50.967 --> 01:21:53.633
Just seeing you here
is gift enough for us.

1567
01:21:53.767 --> 01:21:55.066
Thank you.

1568
01:21:56.200 --> 01:22:00.333
But. I think. who Amelia
actually came back to see

1569
01:22:00.467 --> 01:22:01.633
is down by the stable.

1570
01:22:01.767 --> 01:22:06.133
so if you'd perhaps like to go
and say hi.

1571
01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:17.734
There you go Gus.

1572
01:22:17.967 --> 01:22:21.000
Good job.

1573
01:22:27.667 --> 01:22:29.667
Why aren't you with the party?

1574
01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:33.200
I didn't feel much
like company.

1575
01:22:33.333 --> 01:22:34.533
You came back.

1576
01:22:34.667 --> 01:22:37.467
I came to prove you wrong.

1577
01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:41.867
To prove falling in love
can happen in a matter of days

1578
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.033
if your heart is open.

1579
01:22:44.166 --> 01:22:46.767
You proved that.

1580
01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:48.667
We both did.

1581
01:22:51.166 --> 01:22:52.533
Grady.

1582
01:22:54.567 --> 01:22:56.800
I'm in love with you.

1583
01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:11.734
I'm in love with you too.

1584
01:23:11.867 --> 01:23:14.200
Great.

1585
01:23:14.333 --> 01:23:17.367
Sounds like an adventure.

1586
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.367
Woohoo!
