3
00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:02.975
Okay. Yep.

4
00:01:03.106 --> 00:01:04.368
That's nice.

5
00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:05.369
Wind machine?

6
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.631
Give me more.

7
00:01:06.762 --> 00:01:08.111
Yes.

8
00:01:08.242 --> 00:01:09.504
Yes. That's it.

9
00:01:09.634 --> 00:01:10.766
Uh...

10
00:01:10.896 --> 00:01:12.855
More dirt on
the chest. please.

11
00:01:12.985 --> 00:01:15.118
Perfect. Thank you.

12
00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:17.468
You ever read any of
these romance novels?

13
00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:19.209
Honestly. not my thing. Josh.

14
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.993
But apparently they sell

15
00:01:21.124 --> 00:01:23.735
because the ladies
love your hot body.

16
00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:25.215
Now. come on!
Pump up those pecs.

17
00:01:26.912 --> 00:01:27.696
Nice!

18
00:01:27.826 --> 00:01:29.045
Now gimme some attitude.

19
00:01:30.264 --> 00:01:32.440
I love it.
There it is.

20
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.267
You know. you should
really read this one.

21
00:01:33.397 --> 00:01:34.442
It's pretty good.

22
00:01:34.572 --> 00:01:36.052
You read romance books?

23
00:01:36.183 --> 00:01:38.098
I gotta get into character.

24
00:01:38.228 --> 00:01:39.838
Come on.
You're a total pro.

25
00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:42.145
Honestly. I'm just
not the romantic type.

26
00:01:42.276 --> 00:01:43.886
Sure you are.

27
00:01:44.016 --> 00:01:46.062
You're always hoping romance
is around the corner.

28
00:01:46.193 --> 00:01:48.238
We live in hope.

29
00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:49.631
Now. Come on.

30
00:01:49.761 --> 00:01:50.980
Gimme some more of that
Viking pillage and plunder.

31
00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:51.894
I live to loot!

32
00:01:52.024 --> 00:01:52.982
Yes. Okay.

33
00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:54.288
Gimme the
looting look again.

34
00:01:54.418 --> 00:01:55.898
Yes. there it is.

35
00:02:51.345 --> 00:02:52.911
Okay.
Perfect.

36
00:02:55.653 --> 00:02:56.524
Oh.

37
00:02:58.047 --> 00:02:59.657
Okay. Get in there.

38
00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:02.094
All right. Ready?

39
00:03:02.225 --> 00:03:03.487
Big smiles.

40
00:03:03.618 --> 00:03:04.532
Perfect. Thank you.

41
00:03:05.707 --> 00:03:07.099
What's going on?

42
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.232
The covers. They really
do sell these books.

43
00:03:09.363 --> 00:03:11.582
There is nothing like
a good Viking romance

44
00:03:11.713 --> 00:03:12.931
for summer reading.

45
00:03:15.325 --> 00:03:17.458
I never meet any
guys like that.

46
00:03:17.588 --> 00:03:19.547
What? Your last two
dates had long hair.

47
00:03:19.677 --> 00:03:20.722
Well. I don't think long hair

48
00:03:20.852 --> 00:03:22.767
necessarily means handsome. Sam.

49
00:03:22.898 --> 00:03:24.943
Just means they're not bald.

50
00:03:25.074 --> 00:03:27.424
I could never
date a bald guy.

51
00:03:27.555 --> 00:03:29.861
Wait till you're over 50.

52
00:03:29.992 --> 00:03:31.211
He may be good looking.

53
00:03:31.341 --> 00:03:33.648
But is he boyfriend material?

54
00:03:33.778 --> 00:03:35.606
He's a little two dimensional.

55
00:03:35.737 --> 00:03:38.696
But I do love a man in uniform.

56
00:03:41.917 --> 00:03:43.701
Found Books. Tammy speaking.

57
00:03:43.832 --> 00:03:44.702
Yeah. she's here.

58
00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:47.705
Hello?
Samantha Hill speaking.

59
00:03:47.836 --> 00:03:48.924
Samantha.

60
00:03:49.054 --> 00:03:50.491
It's Lauren Lawrence here.

61
00:03:50.621 --> 00:03:51.796
Oh. hello.

62
00:03:51.927 --> 00:03:53.320
Long time no speak.

63
00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.886
Yeah. I think the
last time I saw you.

64
00:03:55.017 --> 00:03:56.888
you still had braces.

65
00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.543
Well. I'm all grown up now
and running my own bookstore.

66
00:03:59.674 --> 00:04:01.763
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

67
00:04:01.893 --> 00:04:03.678
My father and I are
acting for the estate

68
00:04:03.808 --> 00:04:05.767
of the late Robert MacGraw.

69
00:04:05.897 --> 00:04:07.943
He had an extensive
book collection.

70
00:04:08.073 --> 00:04:10.728
We'd like you to go and value
it with a view to purchase.

71
00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:12.382
Sure. We can do that.

72
00:04:12.513 --> 00:04:14.079
We usually buy
books by the yard.

73
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.386
We sort them into colors
and then we resell them.

74
00:04:16.517 --> 00:04:17.648
Content is irrelevant.

75
00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:19.041
Price depends on condition.

76
00:04:19.171 --> 00:04:20.999
And then we recycle the
ones that we can't use.

77
00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.827
He had some great
leather-bound books.

78
00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.351
Oh. those are
even harder to sell.

79
00:04:24.481 --> 00:04:26.918
Except for people who want
an instant antique library.

80
00:04:27.049 --> 00:04:28.790
We just want the
place cleaned out.

81
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.139
Well. we
charge a fee for that.

82
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.577
which we deduct from
the value of the books.

83
00:04:33.708 --> 00:04:35.013
Fine.

84
00:04:35.144 --> 00:04:36.885
How soon can you get there?

85
00:04:37.015 --> 00:04:38.190
We're a little busy right now.

86
00:04:38.321 --> 00:04:39.844
But by the end of
the week. for sure.

87
00:04:39.975 --> 00:04:41.977
When you get there
park in the back.

88
00:04:42.107 --> 00:04:46.242
The lockbox code on
the front door is 1234.

89
00:04:46.373 --> 00:04:48.592
Do you think you
can remember that?

90
00:04:48.723 --> 00:04:50.377
I will try.

91
00:04:50.507 --> 00:04:51.639
Okay. Bye now.

92
00:04:53.945 --> 00:04:55.469
You never did
like her. Did you?

93
00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:56.948
Nope.

94
00:04:57.079 --> 00:04:58.559
Since high school.
we moved in different circles

95
00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:00.778
and I haven't had to deal
with her. fortunately.

96
00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:03.825
But business is business.

97
00:05:03.955 --> 00:05:05.653
Well. Mr. MacGraw
did buy a lotta books

98
00:05:05.783 --> 00:05:06.871
from us over the years.

99
00:05:07.002 --> 00:05:09.004
His library could
be a real gold mine.

100
00:05:09.134 --> 00:05:10.919
Oh. let's hope.

101
00:05:11.049 --> 00:05:12.573
It's worth checking out.

102
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.804
Just so you know. Mr. MacGraw
was a very wealthy man

103
00:05:26.935 --> 00:05:28.632
and he was a pillar
of our community.

104
00:05:28.763 --> 00:05:29.503
but he kept to himself.

105
00:05:30.634 --> 00:05:31.853
Beautiful old house.

106
00:05:31.983 --> 00:05:32.941
Wow!

107
00:05:45.954 --> 00:05:46.781
Wonder who'll
inherit all of this.

108
00:05:46.911 --> 00:05:48.260
Not sure.

109
00:05:48.391 --> 00:05:49.610
I don't really know too
much about the family.

110
00:05:51.525 --> 00:05:53.701
Hey. there's supposed to be
a keypad around here somewhere.

111
00:05:56.704 --> 00:05:58.009
Ah.

112
00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.054
1234.

113
00:06:00.751 --> 00:06:01.535
How original.

114
00:06:10.892 --> 00:06:12.372
I could live here.

115
00:06:12.502 --> 00:06:14.461
I'd for sure need
a new wardrobe.

116
00:06:14.591 --> 00:06:15.549
Okay. I'm gonna get started.

117
00:06:15.679 --> 00:06:16.724
And I'll get the boxes.

118
00:06:16.854 --> 00:06:17.942
Perfect. Just make
sure that you hit the

119
00:06:18.073 --> 00:06:19.117
home key lock button
on your way back in.

120
00:06:19.248 --> 00:06:20.684
- Got it.
- Thanks.

121
00:06:36.221 --> 00:06:37.092
Wow.

122
00:06:52.063 --> 00:06:52.934
Oh.

123
00:06:56.677 --> 00:06:57.634
Okay.

124
00:06:57.765 --> 00:06:59.984
100 yards at say
30 bucks a yard.

125
00:07:00.115 --> 00:07:01.290
3.000 bucks.

126
00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:02.596
What are we looking to offer?

127
00:07:02.726 --> 00:07:03.945
1.000 to start.

128
00:07:04.075 --> 00:07:05.773
And if they want more.
we'll settle for 1.500.

129
00:07:05.903 --> 00:07:07.688
But then we have to deduct
our cleaning out rate fee.

130
00:07:07.818 --> 00:07:08.950
Perfect.

131
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.778
Okay. So let's start
sorting these books.

132
00:07:14.521 --> 00:07:15.435
Oh wow.

133
00:07:15.565 --> 00:07:17.524
There's a lot of old books here.

134
00:07:17.654 --> 00:07:19.221
There's some
modern novels too.

135
00:07:19.351 --> 00:07:21.005
Some really nice
coffee table books.

136
00:07:21.136 --> 00:07:22.703
Can make a few
dollars on those.

137
00:07:22.833 --> 00:07:24.052
There's a lot of
trashy paper backs.

138
00:07:24.182 --> 00:07:25.662
So we're probably just
gonna recycle those ones.

139
00:07:25.793 --> 00:07:27.708
I like trashy paper backs.

140
00:07:27.838 --> 00:07:29.013
Of course you do.

141
00:07:29.144 --> 00:07:30.014
Go get 'em.

142
00:07:36.107 --> 00:07:37.892
There's dozens of
them in good condition.

143
00:07:38.022 --> 00:07:39.328
Some are brand new.

144
00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:40.590
They might sell.

145
00:07:40.721 --> 00:07:42.070
It's summer.

146
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.769
People love a hot. sexy.
steamy. trashy romance.

147
00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:46.944
You're probably right.

148
00:07:47.075 --> 00:07:48.468
Okay. Let's start
packing those too.

149
00:07:50.339 --> 00:07:52.428
Aw! A poesy of dried violets.

150
00:07:52.559 --> 00:07:53.821
How romantic!

151
00:07:53.951 --> 00:07:54.952
That is cute.

152
00:07:55.083 --> 00:07:56.476
Ooh. If we find any valuables.

153
00:07:56.606 --> 00:07:57.999
let's just put them
on the side here.

154
00:08:03.526 --> 00:08:05.093
What's that?

155
00:08:05.223 --> 00:08:06.137
It's an old house.

156
00:08:06.268 --> 00:08:07.878
They make noises.

157
00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:10.054
Or the ghost just woke up.

158
00:08:10.185 --> 00:08:11.621
Ooh!

159
00:08:11.752 --> 00:08:13.014
I'm just joking.

160
00:08:15.451 --> 00:08:17.148
Well. hello. handsome.

161
00:08:17.279 --> 00:08:18.889
I think we've met before.

162
00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.848
He is dangerously good looking.

163
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.546
He's not bad.

164
00:08:23.677 --> 00:08:25.766
Some of
these covers too.

165
00:08:25.896 --> 00:08:27.071
This one's a few years old.

166
00:08:27.202 --> 00:08:28.638
The Viking must be
at the modeling game

167
00:08:28.769 --> 00:08:29.900
for a really long time.

168
00:08:30.031 --> 00:08:31.641
Not exactly the sort
of reading you'd expect

169
00:08:31.772 --> 00:08:32.860
for an old guy.

170
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:33.817
Yeah. It is kinda weird. huh?

171
00:08:37.778 --> 00:08:39.649
Okay. It's okay.

172
00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.303
Let's go see what's-

173
00:08:41.433 --> 00:08:42.696
what's going on.

174
00:09:12.116 --> 00:09:13.204
Call the cops.

175
00:09:15.467 --> 00:09:16.686
911.
what's your emergency?

176
00:09:16.817 --> 00:09:18.514
Somebody has broken in
and is in the house.

177
00:09:18.645 --> 00:09:22.823
MacGraw Mansion.
Door code is 1234.

178
00:09:22.953 --> 00:09:23.650
We're dispatching
somebody right now.

179
00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:25.652
Okay. Understood.

180
00:09:25.782 --> 00:09:27.131
Okay.

181
00:09:27.262 --> 00:09:28.393
Follow me.

182
00:09:42.712 --> 00:09:43.539
Let's try to find a back way.

183
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:44.584
Okay.

184
00:09:58.685 --> 00:10:00.034
Sam! Sam!

185
00:10:00.164 --> 00:10:01.731
Come on.

186
00:10:01.862 --> 00:10:02.776
Yeah. Right.

187
00:10:13.047 --> 00:10:14.091
He saw us!

188
00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:22.970
I think he's right behind us.

189
00:10:24.536 --> 00:10:26.495
Let's get outta here.

190
00:10:27.583 --> 00:10:29.498
Hey!

191
00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:30.586
Hey!

192
00:10:30.717 --> 00:10:31.413
Hey!

193
00:10:31.543 --> 00:10:32.501
Stand back.

194
00:10:36.679 --> 00:10:37.854
Freeze!

195
00:10:37.985 --> 00:10:39.943
Drop your weapon.

196
00:10:40.074 --> 00:10:40.814
It's a letter opener.

197
00:10:40.944 --> 00:10:42.642
Yeah. well. Drop it.

198
00:10:42.772 --> 00:10:44.382
He's a thief.

199
00:10:44.513 --> 00:10:45.645
I'm not a thief.

200
00:10:45.775 --> 00:10:47.298
Then who are you?
And what do you want?

201
00:10:47.429 --> 00:10:49.779
Drop the. the. this...

202
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.302
The fireplace poker?

203
00:10:51.433 --> 00:10:53.478
Yes. Ms. Hill. drop the poker.

204
00:10:55.393 --> 00:10:57.918
I was just about to ask
Ms. Hill the same thing.

205
00:10:58.048 --> 00:10:58.962
Ask me what?

206
00:10:59.093 --> 00:11:00.355
I'll ask the questions.

207
00:11:00.485 --> 00:11:02.009
Who are you and what
are you doing here?

208
00:11:02.139 --> 00:11:03.706
I'm here at the request
of the estate lawyer

209
00:11:03.837 --> 00:11:04.968
to remove the library. Okay?

210
00:11:05.099 --> 00:11:07.797
Ms. Lawrence
didn't mention that.

211
00:11:07.928 --> 00:11:09.190
Well. I thought
you were thieves.

212
00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.626
Obviously we're not.

213
00:11:10.757 --> 00:11:11.932
That's why we
called the police.

214
00:11:12.062 --> 00:11:12.976
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

215
00:11:13.107 --> 00:11:14.151
What are you doing here?

216
00:11:14.282 --> 00:11:16.632
I'll ask the questions!

217
00:11:16.763 --> 00:11:17.764
What are you doing here?

218
00:11:17.894 --> 00:11:19.374
I'm the owner.

219
00:11:19.504 --> 00:11:21.202
I thought the owner was dead.

220
00:11:21.332 --> 00:11:22.594
He was my grandfather.

221
00:11:22.725 --> 00:11:24.640
Good story. If it's true.

222
00:11:24.771 --> 00:11:25.859
Do you have any ID?

223
00:11:34.824 --> 00:11:36.217
I inherited the house.

224
00:11:38.219 --> 00:11:40.221
You hardly look the type to
inherit the MacGraw Mansion.

225
00:11:40.351 --> 00:11:41.918
Mr. MacGraw was a wealthy man.

226
00:11:42.049 --> 00:11:43.572
What's that supposed to mean?

227
00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:45.052
Well. you were crawling
through that window.

228
00:11:45.182 --> 00:11:47.358
I couldn't remember
the code to the lockbox.

229
00:11:47.489 --> 00:11:48.620
And I'm looking for something.

230
00:11:48.751 --> 00:11:49.709
You forgot 1234?

231
00:11:51.754 --> 00:11:54.452
You can't remember 1234?

232
00:11:54.583 --> 00:11:56.541
Wait. the code was 1234?

233
00:11:56.672 --> 00:11:57.542
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

234
00:11:57.673 --> 00:11:58.543
This is all confusing.

235
00:11:58.674 --> 00:11:59.762
You're confusing him.

236
00:11:59.893 --> 00:12:01.416
Look. you had to call the cops?

237
00:12:01.546 --> 00:12:03.331
She was right to call me. sir.

238
00:12:03.461 --> 00:12:04.941
Even if it is confusing.

239
00:12:06.856 --> 00:12:08.510
Please remove the glasses. sir.

240
00:12:15.125 --> 00:12:16.605
Okay. You check out.

241
00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:18.215
No more confusion.

242
00:12:18.346 --> 00:12:19.260
Mr. Joshua MacGraw.

243
00:12:21.653 --> 00:12:22.567
Satisfied?

244
00:12:23.699 --> 00:12:27.007
I'm sorry. Mr. MacGraw.

245
00:12:28.312 --> 00:12:29.749
There's a pill for that.

246
00:12:29.879 --> 00:12:30.662
If there's nothing else. folks.

247
00:12:30.793 --> 00:12:31.751
I'll be on my way.

248
00:12:31.881 --> 00:12:33.448
Okay. Thanks. Billy.

249
00:12:37.191 --> 00:12:38.975
Well. that was fun.

250
00:12:39.106 --> 00:12:41.108
If you'll excuse me.
I have a lot to do.

251
00:12:44.328 --> 00:12:46.330
That was intense.

252
00:12:46.461 --> 00:12:48.419
Yeah. What a jerk.

253
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:49.769
All right. Well. let's get
this library packed up.

254
00:13:15.011 --> 00:13:16.752
I wonder
what he's looking for.

255
00:13:16.883 --> 00:13:17.753
I hope it's a happy pill.

256
00:13:45.389 --> 00:13:47.870
Okay. Grandpa.

257
00:13:48.001 --> 00:13:49.741
where would you hide
something so important?

258
00:13:56.966 --> 00:13:59.839
Hey. I was just gonna ask
if you wanted to lock up?

259
00:13:59.969 --> 00:14:00.883
No. I'm leaving.

260
00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.192
Should I take a look at
these in case I want a book?

261
00:14:05.322 --> 00:14:06.976
Well. you'll have to
come to my bookstore

262
00:14:07.107 --> 00:14:09.239
since I've officially
taken over the library.

263
00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:12.155
Once the books have been
unpacked. racked. and stacked.

264
00:14:12.286 --> 00:14:13.853
anyone can buy them so...

265
00:14:15.115 --> 00:14:16.029
Right.

266
00:14:17.726 --> 00:14:18.727
Need a hand?

267
00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:19.728
No. I'm good.

268
00:14:20.816 --> 00:14:22.296
Okay.

269
00:14:22.426 --> 00:14:23.732
Have a good night. Ms. Hill.

270
00:14:26.996 --> 00:14:28.258
Have a good night. Ms. Hill.

271
00:14:38.051 --> 00:14:39.966
Thanks. Britt.
It was a good day's work.

272
00:14:40.096 --> 00:14:41.358
Yeah. Except for Mr. Grumpy.

273
00:14:41.489 --> 00:14:42.707
Yeah. he was fun.

274
00:14:42.838 --> 00:14:44.318
Did he look familiar to you?

275
00:14:44.448 --> 00:14:46.233
Nope. And I hope to
never see him again.

276
00:14:52.369 --> 00:14:53.893
He really scared me.
The cops showed up.

277
00:14:54.023 --> 00:14:55.242
It was all okay in the end.

278
00:14:55.372 --> 00:14:56.634
It was just a little
bit embarrassing.

279
00:14:56.765 --> 00:14:58.506
Ah. Billy.

280
00:14:58.636 --> 00:15:00.160
He probably really enjoyed it.

281
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:01.639
Any chance to go clubbing.

282
00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:02.640
He the man.

283
00:15:05.252 --> 00:15:07.297
While you two were out
playing cops and robbers.

284
00:15:07.428 --> 00:15:08.255
I read five books.

285
00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:12.476
Gee. Tammy. That's
a lotta coloring.

286
00:15:12.607 --> 00:15:14.000
Well ha ha.

287
00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:16.045
One of them was on anti-gravity.

288
00:15:16.176 --> 00:15:17.525
Couldn't put it down.

289
00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.573
Found Books. Tammy speaking.

290
00:15:22.704 --> 00:15:24.314
Vikings everywhere.

291
00:15:24.445 --> 00:15:26.577
You know what? Let's put these
on the summer reading display.

292
00:15:26.708 --> 00:15:28.666
The Viking dude sells books.

293
00:15:28.797 --> 00:15:29.885
He is hot.

294
00:15:30.016 --> 00:15:31.931
Sam. telephone.
It's Mr. MacGraw.

295
00:15:32.061 --> 00:15:33.584
Tell him I'm not here.

296
00:15:33.715 --> 00:15:36.283
Okay. Understood. Thanks.

297
00:15:38.024 --> 00:15:40.722
Too late. He's on his way
over to look at his books.

298
00:15:40.852 --> 00:15:41.897
His books?

299
00:15:42.028 --> 00:15:43.377
His books.

300
00:15:43.507 --> 00:15:44.421
Finders keepers?

301
00:15:44.552 --> 00:15:45.857
Not a chance.

302
00:15:45.988 --> 00:15:47.555
We have to give
this to Mr. Grumpy?

303
00:15:47.685 --> 00:15:50.384
Give it to me. I'll put
it in the cash register.

304
00:15:50.514 --> 00:15:51.298
Coffee money.

305
00:16:08.663 --> 00:16:10.273
Are you a
fan of the romance?

306
00:16:13.537 --> 00:16:14.886
Yeah. You could
say that. Yeah.

307
00:16:16.236 --> 00:16:17.237
Well. we have a lot of them.

308
00:16:17.367 --> 00:16:19.065
They're selling really well.

309
00:16:32.034 --> 00:16:32.904
Oh.

310
00:16:37.474 --> 00:16:42.262
Anyway. I'm sorry about the
bad mood yesterday. ladies.

311
00:16:42.392 --> 00:16:43.524
It's fine.

312
00:16:43.654 --> 00:16:45.700
I suppose Vikings are
allowed to be moody.

313
00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:47.615
No. it was just it was a
long drive up from the city.

314
00:16:47.745 --> 00:16:49.834
And my lawyer mentioned
that there was a letter

315
00:16:49.965 --> 00:16:51.836
that she couldn't find that
was in my grandfather's will.

316
00:16:51.967 --> 00:16:53.751
So I thought I'd take a look.

317
00:16:53.882 --> 00:16:55.623
- And?
- Ah. it was a waste of time.

318
00:16:55.753 --> 00:16:57.451
Didn't find a thing.

319
00:16:57.581 --> 00:17:00.541
I'm really sorry about
calling the cop. Billy.

320
00:17:00.671 --> 00:17:02.978
That's fine.
Just a little embarrassing.

321
00:17:03.109 --> 00:17:04.762
We all could have
gotten arrested.

322
00:17:04.893 --> 00:17:06.155
- Or worse.
- Okay. Just...

323
00:17:08.679 --> 00:17:10.855
I have your books in the back
if you just wanna follow me.

324
00:17:10.986 --> 00:17:14.642
Yes please. Lead the way.

325
00:17:14.772 --> 00:17:16.470
That's the thief.

326
00:17:20.082 --> 00:17:21.605
You don't say!

327
00:17:44.715 --> 00:17:46.848
Yeah. I'm not really
seeing much I want here.

328
00:17:46.978 --> 00:17:48.545
Well. I just unpacked
a bunch of paperbacks

329
00:17:48.676 --> 00:17:49.546
with your face on them.

330
00:17:52.158 --> 00:17:53.420
Yeah.

331
00:17:54.943 --> 00:17:56.292
I can't believe that my
grandfather collected these.

332
00:17:56.423 --> 00:17:57.598
Yeah. We wondered about that.

333
00:17:59.817 --> 00:18:01.167
Well. I guess I'll take 'em.

334
00:18:01.297 --> 00:18:03.560
I've never had a
complete set myself.

335
00:18:03.691 --> 00:18:05.258
- How many are there?
- Oh. I don't know.

336
00:18:05.388 --> 00:18:06.520
I've done dozens
of these shoots.

337
00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:08.696
But some are English historical.

338
00:18:08.826 --> 00:18:09.653
Some are Western.

339
00:18:09.784 --> 00:18:10.654
Some are

340
00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:13.875
almost naughty.

341
00:18:16.225 --> 00:18:18.053
I know. They're kind of cheesy.

342
00:18:18.184 --> 00:18:20.925
but I guess my
grandfather approved

343
00:18:21.056 --> 00:18:22.579
of my second career after all.

344
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:23.798
What's your
first. Mr. MacGraw?

345
00:18:23.928 --> 00:18:25.626
Call me Josh.

346
00:18:25.756 --> 00:18:28.237
Mr. MacGraw kinda makes me
sound like my grandfather.

347
00:18:28.368 --> 00:18:29.760
I'm an architect.

348
00:18:29.891 --> 00:18:30.935
This whole modeling thing

349
00:18:31.066 --> 00:18:32.241
was just something
I do on the side.

350
00:18:32.372 --> 00:18:33.242
Hm.

351
00:18:37.681 --> 00:18:40.728
So you're selling
the house then?

352
00:18:40.858 --> 00:18:42.860
Yeah. That's the plan.

353
00:18:42.991 --> 00:18:45.341
I'm so busy in the city and
it's kind of a far commute.

354
00:18:45.472 --> 00:18:46.299
Oh. I'll say.

355
00:18:48.605 --> 00:18:50.390
Anyway.

356
00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.218
I guess I better
get to the lawyer.

357
00:18:52.348 --> 00:18:53.306
Oh. Lauren?

358
00:18:53.436 --> 00:18:54.307
Yeah. I haven't met her yet.

359
00:18:54.437 --> 00:18:56.744
but she seems nice on the phone.

360
00:18:56.874 --> 00:18:58.702
She's nice enough.

361
00:19:00.878 --> 00:19:01.923
- What?
- Nothing.

362
00:19:02.053 --> 00:19:03.403
Do you want any other books?

363
00:19:03.533 --> 00:19:04.839
Can I help you
with anything else?

364
00:19:04.969 --> 00:19:06.319
No. I think I'm good. thanks.

365
00:19:06.449 --> 00:19:08.321
I'm actually allergic
to dust. so...

366
00:19:08.451 --> 00:19:10.323
Must be a problem
when you're ransacking.

367
00:19:11.802 --> 00:19:12.760
These are all the
ones in good condition

368
00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:15.458
and I've dusted you off of them.

369
00:19:15.589 --> 00:19:16.981
Dusted them off for you.

370
00:19:18.113 --> 00:19:20.855
Thank you.

371
00:19:20.985 --> 00:19:23.249
Bless you.

372
00:19:23.379 --> 00:19:25.207
Maybe he's not as
bad as we thought.

373
00:19:26.382 --> 00:19:27.427
He's fine.

374
00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:31.257
Get back to work.

375
00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:46.359
Your grandfather owned quite
a few properties around town.

376
00:19:46.489 --> 00:19:47.490
I had no idea who was
so into real estate.

377
00:19:47.621 --> 00:19:50.711
Mm-hm. He owned some
of these buildings.

378
00:19:50.841 --> 00:19:52.843
Any idea which ones?

379
00:19:52.974 --> 00:19:54.671
Not entirely. My father knows.

380
00:19:54.802 --> 00:19:57.848
He managed your grandfather's
business affairs for years.

381
00:19:57.979 --> 00:20:00.677
I love these old main streets.

382
00:20:00.808 --> 00:20:01.722
The architectural detail.

383
00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:04.594
Oh. look.

384
00:20:04.725 --> 00:20:05.813
Like the decorative corners
in the crown of this building.

385
00:20:05.943 --> 00:20:07.858
I think those are
the original windows.

386
00:20:07.989 --> 00:20:09.556
That's beautiful.

387
00:20:09.686 --> 00:20:11.732
I love how passionate you are.

388
00:20:11.862 --> 00:20:13.342
About architecture? Oh yeah.

389
00:20:15.126 --> 00:20:17.564
These streets used to be the
heart of their communities.

390
00:20:17.694 --> 00:20:20.915
It's kinda sad when they get
hollowed out by development

391
00:20:21.045 --> 00:20:23.352
and big box stores coming
in on the periphery.

392
00:20:23.483 --> 00:20:24.701
What are you gonna do

393
00:20:24.832 --> 00:20:26.442
with all your newly
acquired real estate?

394
00:20:26.573 --> 00:20:28.183
I haven't not that far ahead.

395
00:20:28.314 --> 00:20:30.185
My architectural firm in
the city keeps me very busy.

396
00:20:30.316 --> 00:20:32.622
but I love what I do.

397
00:20:34.015 --> 00:20:37.236
Josh. you're a man
who knows what he wants.

398
00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:40.064
I like that.

399
00:20:42.763 --> 00:20:45.200
Yeah. I actually have a
conference call with the office.

400
00:20:45.331 --> 00:20:48.159
But I'll see you at 1:00.

401
00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:49.160
Can't wait.

402
00:21:07.744 --> 00:21:08.571
- Hi.
- Hey.

403
00:21:09.703 --> 00:21:10.660
Thank you.

404
00:21:10.791 --> 00:21:12.053
- Guess what?
- What?

405
00:21:12.183 --> 00:21:14.229
I just saw the Viking
with that lady lawyer.

406
00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.579
First off. Lauren
Lawrence is no lady.

407
00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:18.712
And second. ask me if I care.

408
00:21:18.842 --> 00:21:21.192
Sam. that's no way to talk
about an old school friend.

409
00:21:21.323 --> 00:21:22.977
She was no friend.

410
00:21:23.107 --> 00:21:24.500
Even if she was the last
lawyer on this planet.

411
00:21:24.631 --> 00:21:25.719
I still wouldn't hire her.

412
00:21:25.849 --> 00:21:27.198
Wow. Harsh.

413
00:21:27.329 --> 00:21:30.506
Sam's folks had a run in
with Lauren's father. Larry.

414
00:21:30.637 --> 00:21:33.161
They took him to court.
something about this building.

415
00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:36.295
He wriggled out of it and
they almost lost the bookstore

416
00:21:36.425 --> 00:21:37.426
trying to pay the court costs.

417
00:21:37.557 --> 00:21:39.385
Well. I was still
in school then.

418
00:21:39.515 --> 00:21:41.474
so I don't really
remember all the details.

419
00:21:41.604 --> 00:21:43.258
Too busy chasing boys?

420
00:21:43.389 --> 00:21:44.694
Oh. there was no point.

421
00:21:44.825 --> 00:21:46.043
Lauren had them all
staring at her legs.

422
00:21:46.174 --> 00:21:47.741
Well. I kind of
feel sorry for her.

423
00:21:47.871 --> 00:21:49.133
What?

424
00:21:49.264 --> 00:21:51.222
She's just as slimy
me as her father.

425
00:21:51.353 --> 00:21:53.616
She had to do
whatever Daddy told her.

426
00:21:53.747 --> 00:21:54.965
He groomed her.

427
00:21:55.096 --> 00:21:56.880
He sent her to the
finest law schools

428
00:21:57.011 --> 00:21:59.796
and then set her up in his
law practice as his partner.

429
00:21:59.927 --> 00:22:01.537
He's a control freak.

430
00:22:01.668 --> 00:22:02.799
I always thought it was funny

431
00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:05.280
that her dad was called
Laurence Lawrence.

432
00:22:05.411 --> 00:22:06.629
It's a good thing
he became a lawyer

433
00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.110
so that he can call
his firm Lawrence Law.

434
00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.286
But then to call
his daughter Lauren.

435
00:22:11.417 --> 00:22:12.983
I mean. Lauren Lawrence?

436
00:22:13.114 --> 00:22:14.855
Not much imagination.

437
00:22:14.985 --> 00:22:16.770
People call him
Larry Two-Names.

438
00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:18.075
He always repeats himself.

439
00:22:18.206 --> 00:22:20.339
He always repeats himself.

440
00:22:23.342 --> 00:22:24.473
Well. I'm glad
your grandparents

441
00:22:24.604 --> 00:22:25.648
didn't lose the store.

442
00:22:25.779 --> 00:22:27.128
Yeah. me too.

443
00:22:27.258 --> 00:22:29.086
If Tom Hill and Milly Dale
hadn't gotten married.

444
00:22:29.217 --> 00:22:31.524
I wouldn't have all this today.

445
00:22:31.654 --> 00:22:33.569
If it wasn't for
your hard work.

446
00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:34.962
this bookstore
wouldn't have survived

447
00:22:35.092 --> 00:22:36.485
after your parents passed.

448
00:22:36.616 --> 00:22:38.052
Yeah.

449
00:22:38.182 --> 00:22:38.966
And maybe I'd be out
there traveling the world

450
00:22:39.096 --> 00:22:40.446
and living a real life. Right?

451
00:22:40.576 --> 00:22:43.144
Oh. don't be so
hard on yourself.

452
00:22:43.274 --> 00:22:45.320
This is the family biz

453
00:22:45.451 --> 00:22:49.063
and you kept it going with
blood. sweat. and tears.

454
00:22:50.717 --> 00:22:51.631
Hill and Dale would be proud.

455
00:22:51.761 --> 00:22:52.849
Thanks. Tammy.

456
00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.461
Hey. time heals all wounds.

457
00:22:55.591 --> 00:22:57.854
That's such a cliche
and it's not true.

458
00:22:57.985 --> 00:22:59.813
Time just covers up the scars.

459
00:23:03.338 --> 00:23:05.601
Okay. That's enough with
this walk down memory lane.

460
00:23:05.732 --> 00:23:07.603
Let's get back to work. ladies.

461
00:23:07.734 --> 00:23:10.214
Thank you.

462
00:23:18.005 --> 00:23:20.834
So what's this
Joshua MacGraw like?

463
00:23:20.964 --> 00:23:24.185
Well. he's good looking.
passionate about his career.

464
00:23:24.315 --> 00:23:26.143
and very busy.

465
00:23:26.274 --> 00:23:28.015
I think I can keep him in line.

466
00:23:28.145 --> 00:23:29.669
Do you now?

467
00:23:29.799 --> 00:23:30.844
Do you now?

468
00:23:30.974 --> 00:23:32.715
Once he takes
ownership of the estate.

469
00:23:32.846 --> 00:23:34.151
I'll convince him

470
00:23:34.282 --> 00:23:36.066
to leave the property
management structure in place.

471
00:23:36.197 --> 00:23:38.591
I'm sure he'll be fine with
the monthly rental checks

472
00:23:38.721 --> 00:23:40.767
and stay in the city.

473
00:23:40.897 --> 00:23:42.856
There's nothing here for him.

474
00:23:42.986 --> 00:23:44.466
I've been milking
this cow for a long time

475
00:23:44.597 --> 00:23:46.425
and I am not ready to
give up the management

476
00:23:46.555 --> 00:23:47.643
of the MacGraw properties.

477
00:23:48.862 --> 00:23:50.341
Bob MacGraw. Ah.

478
00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.735
Didn't care about the business

479
00:23:52.866 --> 00:23:54.128
as long as the money
kept rolling in.

480
00:23:54.258 --> 00:23:57.174
Came in once a year and
signed where I told him to.

481
00:23:57.305 --> 00:23:59.916
Oh. thank goodness
for trusting clients.

482
00:24:00.047 --> 00:24:01.265
I wanted to talk to you

483
00:24:01.396 --> 00:24:02.658
about the missing
letters of codicil.

484
00:24:02.789 --> 00:24:03.703
Are they gonna be a problem?

485
00:24:03.833 --> 00:24:05.487
No idea.

486
00:24:05.618 --> 00:24:07.010
They were mentioned in an
amendment he made to the will.

487
00:24:07.141 --> 00:24:09.404
but Grandpa MacGraw
never produced them.

488
00:24:09.535 --> 00:24:10.797
Probably nothing.

489
00:24:10.927 --> 00:24:13.843
It's just the ramblings
of a senile old man.

490
00:24:13.974 --> 00:24:15.018
As long as you finish
probating the will

491
00:24:15.149 --> 00:24:16.019
before they turn up.

492
00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:18.239
then it shouldn't be a problem.

493
00:24:18.369 --> 00:24:19.980
Meanwhile...

494
00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:21.851
Get him to change his mind
about selling the mansion.

495
00:24:21.982 --> 00:24:23.940
That's my girl!
That's my girl!

496
00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:32.819
Tammy. check this out.

497
00:24:34.081 --> 00:24:36.126
Oh!

498
00:24:36.257 --> 00:24:38.607
Aw. I remember some
of those places

499
00:24:38.738 --> 00:24:41.480
from when I was a little girl.

500
00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:43.090
Not that it was that long ago.

501
00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.265
Of course. black and white.

502
00:24:44.395 --> 00:24:45.745
Just yesterday.

503
00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:51.707
Here's an interesting one.

504
00:24:51.838 --> 00:24:54.493
That.
The MacGraw mansion.

505
00:24:54.623 --> 00:24:55.929
Look at all the staff they had.

506
00:24:56.059 --> 00:24:57.365
Pretty stiff and starched.

507
00:24:58.888 --> 00:25:00.281
Who's that standing
in the middle there?

508
00:25:00.411 --> 00:25:03.414
That would be your grumpy
Viking's great grandparents.

509
00:25:03.545 --> 00:25:04.981
He's not my grumpy Viking.

510
00:25:05.112 --> 00:25:06.505
And since we're
buying his library.

511
00:25:06.635 --> 00:25:08.115
I guess that makes him a client.

512
00:25:08.245 --> 00:25:10.291
So a little bit more
respect there please.

513
00:25:10.421 --> 00:25:12.815
Hm. He is cute.

514
00:25:12.946 --> 00:25:14.687
I'd say handsome.

515
00:25:14.817 --> 00:25:16.340
I didn't say I was interested.

516
00:25:16.471 --> 00:25:18.473
Not at all. Not
even a little bit.

517
00:25:18.604 --> 00:25:19.518
Hmm.

518
00:25:21.084 --> 00:25:22.346
What?

519
00:25:22.477 --> 00:25:24.261
You need to
believe in yourself.

520
00:25:24.392 --> 00:25:26.916
You have so many
fine attributes.

521
00:25:27.047 --> 00:25:29.179
but you insist on
living like a bookworm.

522
00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:31.486
This business
occupies me 24/7.

523
00:25:31.617 --> 00:25:33.532
I don't have time
for other things.

524
00:25:33.662 --> 00:25:34.576
You should make some.

525
00:25:36.012 --> 00:25:36.970
Here's Grandpa
Tom and Grandma Milly

526
00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:38.319
in front of the bookstore.

527
00:25:38.449 --> 00:25:39.842
She was very pretty.

528
00:25:39.973 --> 00:25:41.844
Yeah. she was.

529
00:25:41.975 --> 00:25:43.411
She died the year
before I was born

530
00:25:43.542 --> 00:25:45.413
so I don't really know
too much about her.

531
00:25:49.243 --> 00:25:52.072
Back then. you had
to be very wealthy

532
00:25:52.202 --> 00:25:53.900
to belong to the sailing club.

533
00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:55.510
I like their outfits.

534
00:25:55.641 --> 00:25:56.816
Beautiful clothes.

535
00:25:56.946 --> 00:25:58.426
Even the children are
dressed to the hilt.

536
00:26:00.471 --> 00:26:02.604
And here they are having
a picnic by the lake.

537
00:26:02.735 --> 00:26:04.693
Could you imagine an
old Mr. MacGraw calling

538
00:26:04.824 --> 00:26:06.565
for an ice tea and
then some maid hurrying

539
00:26:06.695 --> 00:26:07.566
over to do his bidding.

540
00:26:09.176 --> 00:26:10.003
That's a good idea.

541
00:26:10.133 --> 00:26:11.134
I'm gonna make some ice tea.

542
00:26:11.265 --> 00:26:12.179
Want some?

543
00:26:12.309 --> 00:26:13.572
No. I'm okay.

544
00:26:13.702 --> 00:26:15.182
I'm gonna go for an
ice cream by the lake.

545
00:26:15.312 --> 00:26:16.531
I need a break.

546
00:26:16.662 --> 00:26:18.359
I'll settle for an ice tea.

547
00:26:18.489 --> 00:26:19.708
Thanks. Tammy.

548
00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.504
Ah. sorry about that.

549
00:26:33.635 --> 00:26:34.549
Client issue.

550
00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:36.029
They always want changes.

551
00:26:36.159 --> 00:26:38.161
Oh. yeah. It's the
same in my practice.

552
00:26:42.862 --> 00:26:45.255
I forgot how nice it was
here. down by the lake.

553
00:26:45.386 --> 00:26:47.388
My dad and I used to come visit
my grandpa when I was a kid.

554
00:26:47.518 --> 00:26:49.520
But I haven't been here
in a long. long time.

555
00:26:51.044 --> 00:26:52.088
I guess not since
my dad passed away.

556
00:26:52.219 --> 00:26:54.743
Do you remember
your grandfather?

557
00:26:54.874 --> 00:26:56.615
I had this picture
of him and I standing

558
00:26:56.745 --> 00:26:57.616
in front of the mansion.

559
00:26:57.746 --> 00:26:59.400
I always kept it with me.

560
00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:01.663
And then standing at the
property yesterday. it just

561
00:27:03.665 --> 00:27:04.797
brought back a lotta memories.

562
00:27:06.059 --> 00:27:07.626
Yeah.

563
00:27:07.756 --> 00:27:08.801
Speaking of the mansion.

564
00:27:10.716 --> 00:27:12.935
I think you should reconsider
selling the mansion.

565
00:27:13.066 --> 00:27:14.720
The way the market is.

566
00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:16.460
I'd toss it in with the rest
of your rental properties.

567
00:27:16.591 --> 00:27:18.201
Dealing with the renters
could be a bit of a headache.

568
00:27:18.332 --> 00:27:19.638
don't you think?

569
00:27:19.768 --> 00:27:20.726
Agreed.

570
00:27:20.856 --> 00:27:22.162
I think you should leave it

571
00:27:22.292 --> 00:27:24.120
with the property
management company.

572
00:27:24.251 --> 00:27:25.644
It's worked for
your grandfather.

573
00:27:25.774 --> 00:27:27.254
Yeah.

574
00:27:27.384 --> 00:27:28.908
Yeah. Let me think about it.

575
00:27:38.091 --> 00:27:39.135
Oh.

576
00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:43.139
Oh dear.

577
00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:44.010
I probably should
have told her.

578
00:27:46.752 --> 00:27:48.710
I heard you bumped
into her at the mansion.

579
00:27:48.841 --> 00:27:49.668
Didn't go so well.

580
00:27:51.191 --> 00:27:52.758
Kinda feel like I should
make it up to her.

581
00:27:52.888 --> 00:27:54.498
She's an odd duck.

582
00:27:54.629 --> 00:27:55.412
I wouldn't worry about it.

583
00:27:57.414 --> 00:28:00.374
She's gonna get money from
your grandfather's library.

584
00:28:00.504 --> 00:28:02.376
I'm sure that's all
she cares about anyway.

585
00:28:05.422 --> 00:28:07.990
You know. that's a good
time to do whatever...

586
00:28:10.906 --> 00:28:11.733
Hey!

587
00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:15.694
What?

588
00:28:19.654 --> 00:28:22.396
I used to read
these all the time.

589
00:28:24.833 --> 00:28:26.661
So there I am with an ice
cream cone melting in my hand

590
00:28:26.792 --> 00:28:27.967
and Josh is having a
meeting with Lauren.

591
00:28:28.097 --> 00:28:29.446
And then they started
laughing at me.

592
00:28:29.577 --> 00:28:30.709
And now Billy's being
all weird outside.

593
00:28:30.839 --> 00:28:32.232
I don't know what's going on.

594
00:28:35.017 --> 00:28:36.845
What?

595
00:28:36.976 --> 00:28:39.500
You look kinda cute with
rocky road on your nose.

596
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:40.544
Hm?

597
00:28:46.246 --> 00:28:47.203
Oh my God!

598
00:28:59.694 --> 00:29:00.739
Ain't that life?

599
00:29:00.869 --> 00:29:02.653
Just one rocky road.

600
00:29:03.698 --> 00:29:04.655
Yeah.

601
00:29:19.322 --> 00:29:21.672
I guess I should
tell him about this.

602
00:29:21.803 --> 00:29:23.239
Yes.

603
00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:26.634
And you should give
him the $100 bill too.

604
00:29:26.765 --> 00:29:27.766
That's our coffee money!

605
00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:31.378
Call him.

606
00:29:31.508 --> 00:29:32.292
I'll think about it.

607
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:35.599
Come on. Phone him.

608
00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:36.644
Okay. I will.

609
00:29:36.775 --> 00:29:38.037
But only to keep you two quiet.

610
00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:40.691
Now go away.

611
00:29:56.533 --> 00:29:57.578
Hello?

612
00:29:57.708 --> 00:29:59.101
It's Sam.

613
00:29:59.232 --> 00:30:00.624
From the bookstore.

614
00:30:00.755 --> 00:30:02.452
I was just thinking about you.

615
00:30:02.583 --> 00:30:04.411
Why? So you could
laugh at me some more?

616
00:30:04.541 --> 00:30:05.934
Yeah.

617
00:30:06.065 --> 00:30:07.675
I'm sorry about that.

618
00:30:07.806 --> 00:30:10.112
Yeah. Well you could
have said something.

619
00:30:10.243 --> 00:30:11.722
You're right.

620
00:30:11.853 --> 00:30:12.680
I should have.

621
00:30:14.464 --> 00:30:15.988
Look. hey. now that I
got you on the phone.

622
00:30:16.118 --> 00:30:17.424
can I ask you something?

623
00:30:17.554 --> 00:30:19.208
Are there any good
restaurants in town?

624
00:30:19.339 --> 00:30:21.123
Why don't you ask Lauren?

625
00:30:21.254 --> 00:30:23.517
I don't really like to
mix business with personal.

626
00:30:25.954 --> 00:30:28.609
Well. there's an Italian
place on Front Street.

627
00:30:28.739 --> 00:30:30.045
Great.

628
00:30:30.176 --> 00:30:32.656
Did you wanna maybe join
me for an early dinner?

629
00:30:32.787 --> 00:30:33.744
What?

630
00:30:33.875 --> 00:30:34.745
I'm business.

631
00:30:34.876 --> 00:30:38.967
I mean. this call is business.

632
00:30:39.098 --> 00:30:40.839
Well. not really.

633
00:30:40.969 --> 00:30:43.015
You know. I'm just asking
for a dinner recommendation.

634
00:30:43.145 --> 00:30:44.103
I called you.

635
00:30:44.233 --> 00:30:45.191
Yeah. Oh yeah.

636
00:30:45.321 --> 00:30:46.453
Was it about the books?

637
00:30:46.583 --> 00:30:47.671
Yes.

638
00:30:49.064 --> 00:30:50.631
Well. you see that's
business with the estate.

639
00:30:50.761 --> 00:30:51.850
Not with you and me.

640
00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:53.242
How's 5:30 sound?

641
00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:56.202
Okay. fine.

642
00:30:56.332 --> 00:31:00.380
But I need to talk to
you about some business.

643
00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:01.642
Dinner at 5:30.

644
00:31:01.772 --> 00:31:02.773
I'll see you there.

645
00:31:02.904 --> 00:31:03.774
Strictly business.

646
00:31:03.905 --> 00:31:05.167
What's that?

647
00:31:05.298 --> 00:31:06.212
I'm going for business.

648
00:31:06.342 --> 00:31:07.996
I mean. I'm going for dinner.

649
00:31:08.127 --> 00:31:09.650
- When?
- 5:30.

650
00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:11.434
Wow. You better get ready.

651
00:31:11.565 --> 00:31:12.392
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

652
00:31:13.654 --> 00:31:15.351
Yeah. I better get ready.

653
00:31:15.482 --> 00:31:16.265
- Yeah.
- Okay.

654
00:31:17.745 --> 00:31:18.659
Oh-

655
00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:20.530
We'll lock the front door.

656
00:31:20.661 --> 00:31:21.575
Okay.

657
00:31:43.989 --> 00:31:44.903
Hello.

658
00:31:46.078 --> 00:31:46.948
Hi. Hi.

659
00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:50.691
So sorry I'm late.

660
00:31:50.821 --> 00:31:53.346
I had to go upstairs and change.

661
00:31:53.476 --> 00:31:54.434
Upstairs?

662
00:31:54.564 --> 00:31:56.218
Nevermind. I'm here.

663
00:31:56.349 --> 00:31:57.698
Well. I'm glad

664
00:31:57.828 --> 00:31:59.569
'cause I was gonna drink
that whole bottle by myself.

665
00:32:00.919 --> 00:32:03.182
I can mix business
with pleasure.

666
00:32:03.312 --> 00:32:04.400
I'll help you.

667
00:32:09.449 --> 00:32:11.407
Thank you.

668
00:32:11.538 --> 00:32:13.105
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

669
00:32:17.761 --> 00:32:19.981
Mm!

670
00:32:20.112 --> 00:32:22.810
Okay. Some ground
rules before we start.

671
00:32:22.941 --> 00:32:25.639
I'm only gonna stay
if we split the check.

672
00:32:25.769 --> 00:32:27.597
- Really?
- Yes. really.

673
00:32:27.728 --> 00:32:29.599
I do have
business to discuss.

674
00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:30.731
Okay.

675
00:32:30.861 --> 00:32:32.951
But could we order first?

676
00:32:33.081 --> 00:32:33.952
Sure.

677
00:32:36.693 --> 00:32:38.391
Any recommendations?

678
00:32:38.521 --> 00:32:40.523
The eggplant Parmesan
is really good.

679
00:32:40.654 --> 00:32:42.221
You a vegetarian?

680
00:32:42.351 --> 00:32:44.614
Trying. I don't
eat red meat anymore.

681
00:32:44.745 --> 00:32:45.572
I think I'll have the same.

682
00:32:45.702 --> 00:32:46.529
Excellent selection.

683
00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:47.530
Thank you.

684
00:32:50.533 --> 00:32:51.752
- So...
- So...

685
00:32:51.882 --> 00:32:53.580
Tell me about yourself.

686
00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:55.886
How did you get into
the book business?

687
00:32:56.017 --> 00:32:57.758
I inherited the
store from my parents

688
00:32:57.888 --> 00:32:58.715
after they passed away.

689
00:32:58.846 --> 00:33:00.587
Oh. I'm sorry.

690
00:33:00.717 --> 00:33:02.154
Yeah. I really miss them.

691
00:33:03.764 --> 00:33:05.244
How about a cheers?

692
00:33:05.374 --> 00:33:06.897
To your parents and
the good memories.

693
00:33:09.074 --> 00:33:10.031
Thank you.

694
00:33:14.818 --> 00:33:15.906
- Agua?
- Yes. please.

695
00:33:19.693 --> 00:33:21.260
Oh. I'm sorry.

696
00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:22.435
It's okay.

697
00:33:22.565 --> 00:33:23.740
I'm a little bit nervous.

698
00:33:23.871 --> 00:33:25.090
Nervous?

699
00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:26.743
A hunk of a Viking like you?

700
00:33:26.874 --> 00:33:27.701
Mm.

701
00:33:27.831 --> 00:33:29.659
Yeah.

702
00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:32.314
Yeah. no. that's not me.

703
00:33:34.055 --> 00:33:35.665
Modeling is something I did

704
00:33:35.796 --> 00:33:37.841
just to pay my way through
architectural school.

705
00:33:37.972 --> 00:33:39.365
But it's fun.
You know. I like it.

706
00:33:39.495 --> 00:33:42.411
You get to make faces and get
paid to play pretend so...

707
00:33:42.542 --> 00:33:44.544
Well. my whole bookstore
is full of pretend

708
00:33:44.674 --> 00:33:47.938
so I completely
understand pretend.

709
00:33:48.069 --> 00:33:48.983
You know. I think
some people assume

710
00:33:49.114 --> 00:33:50.898
that models can
just do one thing.

711
00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:53.640
But. you know. most of us
have other careers and jobs.

712
00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:55.294
How did you get
into architecture?

713
00:33:55.424 --> 00:33:57.557
I always loved drawing
and building things.

714
00:33:57.687 --> 00:33:59.907
And when the modeling picked up.

715
00:34:00.038 --> 00:34:04.433
it took me to places like
Italy and Paris. Greece.

716
00:34:04.564 --> 00:34:05.869
Man. seeing all that
incredible architecture

717
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.828
has just gotten me so fired up.

718
00:34:07.958 --> 00:34:09.395
That sounds so...

719
00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:11.527
Romantic?

720
00:34:11.658 --> 00:34:12.572
Yeah.

721
00:34:13.964 --> 00:34:15.401
I mean traveling the world.

722
00:34:15.531 --> 00:34:17.359
seeing things I've only
ever seen in books.

723
00:34:17.490 --> 00:34:19.231
All that history.
all that culture.

724
00:34:20.884 --> 00:34:22.060
Yeah. That sounds a
little more interesting

725
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:23.061
than Sylvan Lake.

726
00:34:25.933 --> 00:34:28.109
Well. if you could go
anywhere. where would you go?

727
00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:31.504
I don't know.

728
00:34:31.634 --> 00:34:32.853
I've always wanted
to go to Italy.

729
00:34:32.983 --> 00:34:34.376
Well then. pack your bags.

730
00:34:35.856 --> 00:34:37.640
Oh I think the
eggplant Parmesan is

731
00:34:37.771 --> 00:34:38.989
as close as I'm gonna get.

732
00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:40.208
But it's okay.

733
00:34:46.301 --> 00:34:47.215
Excuse me.

734
00:35:35.394 --> 00:35:36.830
See. it's not where you
are. It's who you're with.

735
00:35:43.402 --> 00:35:45.099
To our health.

736
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:46.622
That's pretty good.

737
00:35:46.753 --> 00:35:47.841
Brava.

738
00:35:47.971 --> 00:35:49.059
I like pretend.

739
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:50.887
So do I.

740
00:35:51.018 --> 00:35:51.888
Good.

741
00:35:53.977 --> 00:35:56.458
Okay. But I'm serious about
this being a business dinner.

742
00:35:56.589 --> 00:35:59.113
- Okay?
- If you insist.

743
00:35:59.244 --> 00:36:00.506
Here. There you go.

744
00:36:00.636 --> 00:36:02.203
Wines of the world.

745
00:36:02.334 --> 00:36:04.771
Well. that's gonna come in
handy when we go to Paris.

746
00:36:04.901 --> 00:36:06.076
Just open it.

747
00:36:08.427 --> 00:36:09.558
A fake book!

748
00:36:09.689 --> 00:36:11.256
It was in your
grandfather's library.

749
00:36:11.386 --> 00:36:13.432
So I just. I thought
you should have it.

750
00:36:13.562 --> 00:36:14.520
Huh?

751
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.524
Now we know the
budget for dinner.

752
00:36:18.654 --> 00:36:19.960
Okay.

753
00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:21.918
$100 dinner it is.
on your grandfather.

754
00:36:23.398 --> 00:36:24.182
And what is this?

755
00:36:26.009 --> 00:36:28.708
I thought it might be the
key to something special.

756
00:36:28.838 --> 00:36:29.796
Any ideas?

757
00:36:29.926 --> 00:36:31.058
No. none.

758
00:36:33.147 --> 00:36:34.540
But he had it hidden
in his library.

759
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:37.934
Maybe it's a hidden passageway?

760
00:36:38.065 --> 00:36:39.327
Hidden treasure?

761
00:36:39.458 --> 00:36:41.373
Could be the key to
the missing letter.

762
00:36:41.503 --> 00:36:43.462
Yeah.
I like that.

763
00:36:43.592 --> 00:36:44.767
Okay.

764
00:36:44.898 --> 00:36:45.638
I'm gonna have to
go check the house.

765
00:36:48.641 --> 00:36:49.555
More business.

766
00:36:49.685 --> 00:36:50.991
More?

767
00:36:51.121 --> 00:36:53.341
We bought the library
as books by the yard.

768
00:36:53.472 --> 00:36:55.648
So it worked out to $1.000.
less our service fee.

769
00:36:55.778 --> 00:36:57.519
Well. you are the expert.

770
00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:59.782
But we found some
fabulous first editions.

771
00:36:59.913 --> 00:37:00.827
much more valuable.

772
00:37:00.957 --> 00:37:03.569
So I estimated their value

773
00:37:03.699 --> 00:37:05.484
and I wanted to
split that with you.

774
00:37:05.614 --> 00:37:06.746
So here...

775
00:37:06.876 --> 00:37:07.877
You didn't have to do that.

776
00:37:08.008 --> 00:37:09.923
I know. but I want to.

777
00:37:10.053 --> 00:37:11.359
The check's made
out to the estate

778
00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:12.882
so you're not gonna be
able to spend it tonight.

779
00:37:13.013 --> 00:37:15.842
But I'm pretty sure you're
gonna be pleased with the total.

780
00:37:15.972 --> 00:37:17.365
Dinner's on me.

781
00:37:17.496 --> 00:37:18.932
No arguments on that.

782
00:37:19.062 --> 00:37:20.716
Write it off as
a business expense.

783
00:37:20.847 --> 00:37:22.588
Well. if Lauren
will sign off on it.

784
00:37:24.546 --> 00:37:26.113
Lauren?

785
00:37:26.244 --> 00:37:27.593
You don't seem
to like her much.

786
00:37:27.723 --> 00:37:29.203
Why?

787
00:37:29.334 --> 00:37:30.813
To put it bluntly.

788
00:37:30.944 --> 00:37:32.859
she just. she made my life
hell when we were teenagers.

789
00:37:32.989 --> 00:37:33.990
That's all.

790
00:37:34.121 --> 00:37:35.557
And it still bothers you?

791
00:37:35.688 --> 00:37:36.993
No. it doesn't.

792
00:37:37.124 --> 00:37:38.691
We're certainly not friends.

793
00:37:38.821 --> 00:37:41.607
You know. she has been
privileged all of her life

794
00:37:41.737 --> 00:37:44.174
and just takes what she wants.

795
00:37:44.305 --> 00:37:45.524
Well. she's not
taking anything

796
00:37:45.654 --> 00:37:47.308
from me except for a
standard probate. So.

797
00:37:47.439 --> 00:37:49.528
And her dad. Larry
Lawrence. is even worse.

798
00:37:49.658 --> 00:37:51.051
My folks were in a
lawsuit with him once.

799
00:37:51.181 --> 00:37:52.661
Nearly cost us our bookstore.

800
00:37:52.792 --> 00:37:55.882
So I just don't trust them.

801
00:37:56.012 --> 00:37:57.623
That's all.

802
00:37:57.753 --> 00:37:59.102
Well. thank you
for the warning.

803
00:37:59.233 --> 00:38:00.190
Yeah.

804
00:38:02.541 --> 00:38:03.411
To my grandpa.

805
00:38:04.543 --> 00:38:05.413
To your nonno.

806
00:38:11.767 --> 00:38:12.638
What was he like?

807
00:38:15.075 --> 00:38:15.815
He was the kindest
man imaginable.

808
00:38:18.165 --> 00:38:21.429
You think about
your parents a lot?

809
00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:22.430
Every day.

810
00:38:23.649 --> 00:38:25.651
They left me the
bookstore. which I love.

811
00:38:25.781 --> 00:38:28.958
But. you know. it was a lot
to take on for a 19 year old.

812
00:38:29.089 --> 00:38:30.873
You've obviously
done very well.

813
00:38:31.004 --> 00:38:32.962
I get by. but it's
a lot of hard work.

814
00:38:33.093 --> 00:38:34.747
Keeping a good inventory.

815
00:38:34.877 --> 00:38:36.792
stocking the right
books at the right time.

816
00:38:36.923 --> 00:38:38.968
Like the romance novels
at this time of the year.

817
00:38:39.099 --> 00:38:41.971
The summer visitors just
come in and lap them up.

818
00:38:42.102 --> 00:38:42.972
Yeah. I can see that.

819
00:38:45.453 --> 00:38:46.846
So what kinda books do you like?

820
00:38:46.976 --> 00:38:47.803
Oh. all of them.

821
00:38:49.327 --> 00:38:51.285
But I haven't read a lot
of the romance novels.

822
00:38:51.416 --> 00:38:52.721
to be honest.

823
00:38:52.852 --> 00:38:54.114
What about you?

824
00:38:54.244 --> 00:38:55.245
Yeah. I've read a few.

825
00:38:56.421 --> 00:38:57.987
- Really?
- Yeah.

826
00:38:58.118 --> 00:38:59.424
But it's research. right?

827
00:38:59.554 --> 00:39:01.034
You know. I have to
get into character.

828
00:39:01.164 --> 00:39:02.905
Of course. Yeah.

829
00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:06.735
It's better with
the wig and the whole thing.

830
00:39:06.866 --> 00:39:07.954
My parents made the
children's section just for me.

831
00:39:08.084 --> 00:39:11.261
So after school. I
spent all my time there.

832
00:39:11.392 --> 00:39:13.699
I was a real little bookworm.

833
00:39:13.829 --> 00:39:14.787
I just. I don't know.

834
00:39:14.917 --> 00:39:16.136
I love books.

835
00:39:16.266 --> 00:39:17.224
Yeah. I can see that.

836
00:39:34.633 --> 00:39:36.069
You know. my grandfather
used to take me sailing

837
00:39:36.199 --> 00:39:37.592
on the lake.

838
00:39:37.723 --> 00:39:38.854
It was magical.

839
00:39:38.985 --> 00:39:41.379
It was like flying
across the water.

840
00:39:41.509 --> 00:39:42.554
That's so nice.

841
00:39:42.684 --> 00:39:43.859
It was a nice night.

842
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:47.559
Thanks for agreeing to
come to dinner with me.

843
00:39:49.256 --> 00:39:50.257
Well. I thought since we
got off to such a bad start.

844
00:39:50.388 --> 00:39:53.260
you know. give you the
benefit of the doubt.

845
00:39:54.696 --> 00:39:55.567
And?

846
00:39:57.046 --> 00:39:58.613
There's more to you
than meets the eye.

847
00:39:59.875 --> 00:40:01.268
I'm glad you feel that way.

848
00:40:03.836 --> 00:40:06.447
You. Joshua MacGraw. are
a very interesting man.

849
00:40:07.796 --> 00:40:09.581
Pretty interesting yourself.

850
00:40:09.711 --> 00:40:12.105
First time I saw you standing
there with the fire poker.

851
00:40:13.976 --> 00:40:15.804
You gimme a fire poker
and I can take on anyone.

852
00:40:15.935 --> 00:40:17.763
I believe it.

853
00:40:17.893 --> 00:40:20.330
Well. you can take
care of yourself.

854
00:40:20.461 --> 00:40:21.331
I like that.

855
00:40:24.509 --> 00:40:26.728
Well. I have an
early start tomorrow.

856
00:40:26.859 --> 00:40:28.817
So I'm gonna go.

857
00:40:28.948 --> 00:40:30.776
It's getting late.

858
00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:34.606
Will you come over to
mansion with me this weekend?

859
00:40:35.955 --> 00:40:38.566
Help me find a
lock for that key?

860
00:40:38.697 --> 00:40:39.741
Of course.

861
00:40:41.961 --> 00:40:42.962
Thanks for dinner.

862
00:40:43.092 --> 00:40:45.747
And I'll see you Saturday.

863
00:40:45.878 --> 00:40:47.140
Arrevederci.

864
00:40:49.185 --> 00:40:53.929
A presto.

865
00:41:21.522 --> 00:41:22.741
Ah.

866
00:41:22.871 --> 00:41:25.483
Good afternoon. Mr. MacGraw!

867
00:41:25.613 --> 00:41:27.789
Larry Lawrence. It's an
honor to meet you at last.

868
00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.530
Your grandfather
spoke of you often.

869
00:41:29.661 --> 00:41:30.662
He did?

870
00:41:30.792 --> 00:41:32.272
Oh. yes. he did. Yes. he did.

871
00:41:32.402 --> 00:41:34.927
He was quite proud of your
architectural exploits

872
00:41:35.057 --> 00:41:35.841
and your other enterprises.

873
00:41:38.365 --> 00:41:40.062
It's so nice to speak to
such an important new client.

874
00:41:40.193 --> 00:41:42.500
Well. I don't know
how important I am but-

875
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:43.849
Oh. very important.

876
00:41:43.979 --> 00:41:45.633
Very important.

877
00:41:45.764 --> 00:41:46.852
You're gonna be one of the
biggest property owners

878
00:41:46.982 --> 00:41:48.680
in town. Mr. MacGraw.

879
00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:49.811
Can I ask you a question?

880
00:41:49.942 --> 00:41:51.509
Fire away?

881
00:41:51.639 --> 00:41:53.032
Are you planning on
moving back to Sylvan Lake?

882
00:41:53.162 --> 00:41:54.773
We have a property
management company

883
00:41:54.903 --> 00:41:56.165
looking after your
grandfather's interests.

884
00:41:56.296 --> 00:41:57.602
Would you like them
to continue on?

885
00:41:57.732 --> 00:41:59.038
Daddy.

886
00:41:59.168 --> 00:42:00.561
Let's not rush things.

887
00:42:00.692 --> 00:42:02.694
Mr. MacGraw likes
to take things slow.

888
00:42:02.824 --> 00:42:04.565
Ah. well then why don't you

889
00:42:04.696 --> 00:42:07.307
show Mr. MacGraw the territory?

890
00:42:07.437 --> 00:42:08.264
Sure. Come.

891
00:42:08.395 --> 00:42:09.352
Follow me.

892
00:42:11.833 --> 00:42:14.880
The art collection at Lawrence
Law is one of our passions.

893
00:42:15.010 --> 00:42:15.881
It's very impressive.

894
00:42:16.011 --> 00:42:17.230
And so is our practice.

895
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:19.798
Now. how was court
today. Lauren?

896
00:42:19.928 --> 00:42:20.799
How was court?

897
00:42:20.929 --> 00:42:21.974
Excellent.

898
00:42:22.104 --> 00:42:24.150
We won. of course.

899
00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:26.282
I didn't think you're
coming in today. Daddy.

900
00:42:26.413 --> 00:42:27.501
Oh. thought I might.
Thought I might.

901
00:42:27.632 --> 00:42:30.373
Would be nice to have
some new blood in town.

902
00:42:30.504 --> 00:42:32.680
I should put Mr. MacGraw
for a local business club.

903
00:42:32.811 --> 00:42:34.334
Oh. please. call me Josh.

904
00:42:34.464 --> 00:42:36.292
Oh. and you call me Larry.

905
00:42:36.423 --> 00:42:37.772
Sure. Larry.

906
00:42:37.903 --> 00:42:38.773
I don't think Josh
would be interested

907
00:42:38.904 --> 00:42:40.906
in joining your stuffy
old club. Daddy.

908
00:42:41.036 --> 00:42:43.299
Well. when Mr. Josh sees

909
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:44.823
just how much of
the town he owns.

910
00:42:44.953 --> 00:42:45.998
he may wanna be part of the
town's senior leadership.

911
00:42:46.128 --> 00:42:48.130
Well. there's
a lotta decisions

912
00:42:48.261 --> 00:42:49.175
to be made before
I decide on that.

913
00:42:49.305 --> 00:42:51.873
He's got a very
good job in the city.

914
00:42:52.004 --> 00:42:54.049
In fact. I was just offered
a promotion to partner.

915
00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:55.703
- Congratulations!
- Thanks!

916
00:42:55.834 --> 00:42:57.575
Wonderful! Wonderful!

917
00:42:57.705 --> 00:42:59.011
You're a very busy man

918
00:42:59.141 --> 00:43:01.143
and you've inherited
a big responsibility.

919
00:43:01.274 --> 00:43:02.928
Take a look.

920
00:43:03.058 --> 00:43:04.407
Now I handled the purchases
of these properties myself.

921
00:43:04.538 --> 00:43:05.974
but in the intervening years.

922
00:43:06.105 --> 00:43:08.194
the property management
company your grandfather hired

923
00:43:08.324 --> 00:43:10.196
has taken care of the details.

924
00:43:10.326 --> 00:43:11.501
See. I always
thought my grandfather

925
00:43:11.632 --> 00:43:12.546
was in the mining business.

926
00:43:12.677 --> 00:43:13.547
He sold out years ago.

927
00:43:13.678 --> 00:43:15.593
Went into commercial
real estate.

928
00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:19.684
Now. Lauren tells
me you're putting

929
00:43:19.814 --> 00:43:21.729
the mansion on the market.

930
00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:22.904
Do you think that's a good idea?

931
00:43:23.035 --> 00:43:24.297
Well. I do like it.

932
00:43:24.427 --> 00:43:25.298
I think there's a
lotta potential.

933
00:43:25.428 --> 00:43:27.779
It's just a lotta
work to update.

934
00:43:27.909 --> 00:43:30.912
Perhaps the management
company could handle it.

935
00:43:31.043 --> 00:43:32.827
- Yeah. I should talk them.
- I can do that.

936
00:43:32.958 --> 00:43:35.830
Now. Lauren is handling
the probate of the will.

937
00:43:35.961 --> 00:43:38.093
which I understand is
very straightforward.

938
00:43:39.486 --> 00:43:41.836
Your grandfather
made it very clear

939
00:43:41.967 --> 00:43:46.145
that everything goes to
his favorite grandson.

940
00:43:46.275 --> 00:43:48.974
Clear. except for the mention
of the letters of codicil.

941
00:43:49.104 --> 00:43:51.933
I asked one of my team
to look in the archives.

942
00:43:52.064 --> 00:43:53.021
see if they might be there.

943
00:43:53.152 --> 00:43:55.154
Or maybe they've been misfiled.

944
00:43:55.284 --> 00:43:56.416
Well. that's assuming

945
00:43:56.546 --> 00:43:57.286
that your grandfather
brought them in

946
00:43:57.417 --> 00:43:58.810
or that they even exist.

947
00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:00.202
Well. he put it in the will.

948
00:44:00.333 --> 00:44:01.551
So it must have been
important to him.

949
00:44:01.682 --> 00:44:03.075
I remember him coming in

950
00:44:03.205 --> 00:44:04.729
and adding the amendment
about the letters.

951
00:44:04.859 --> 00:44:07.035
I just don't think he
ever followed through.

952
00:44:09.124 --> 00:44:12.258
I hate to tell you this.
Josh. but the last few years.

953
00:44:12.388 --> 00:44:15.827
your grandfather. let's just
say he was a little off.

954
00:44:15.957 --> 00:44:18.351
He had little contact with
anyone and he seemed...

955
00:44:18.481 --> 00:44:19.831
Are you saying he
was incompetent or...

956
00:44:19.961 --> 00:44:21.093
Oh. not at all. Not at all.

957
00:44:21.223 --> 00:44:22.268
Sharp as ever.

958
00:44:22.398 --> 00:44:24.705
Just a bit forgetful at times.

959
00:44:24.836 --> 00:44:26.098
Maybe he intended
to write the letters

960
00:44:26.228 --> 00:44:27.621
and never got around to it.

961
00:44:27.752 --> 00:44:29.144
If they show up.
we'll deal with it.

962
00:44:29.275 --> 00:44:31.669
In the meantime. let's just
continue on the process.

963
00:44:31.799 --> 00:44:33.061
Not to worry. Not to worry.

964
00:44:33.192 --> 00:44:34.410
You're in good
hands with Lauren.

965
00:44:38.414 --> 00:44:39.285
Oh. you know what?

966
00:44:39.415 --> 00:44:40.286
That reminds me.

967
00:44:40.416 --> 00:44:41.374
What? What?

968
00:44:41.504 --> 00:44:42.723
Lauren. you
negotiated the deal

969
00:44:42.854 --> 00:44:43.506
for the Found Bookshop
to sell all the books

970
00:44:43.637 --> 00:44:44.682
in the library.

971
00:44:44.812 --> 00:44:46.335
Yeah.

972
00:44:46.466 --> 00:44:48.033
The owner gave me this
check last night. So.

973
00:44:49.774 --> 00:44:50.644
Last night?

974
00:44:50.775 --> 00:44:51.906
Samantha.

975
00:44:52.037 --> 00:44:52.994
Yeah.

976
00:44:53.125 --> 00:44:54.692
Yeah. we went to dinner.

977
00:44:54.822 --> 00:44:57.346
Just getting to know the
local business leaders. So.

978
00:44:57.477 --> 00:45:00.132
Anyway. this turned up
and I was wondering.

979
00:45:00.262 --> 00:45:01.524
do you guys have any
idea what this is?

980
00:45:01.655 --> 00:45:05.703
Hmm.

981
00:45:05.833 --> 00:45:06.791
No idea.

982
00:45:06.921 --> 00:45:09.010
Drink? Drink?

983
00:45:09.141 --> 00:45:10.055
No. thank you.

984
00:45:10.185 --> 00:45:11.317
I wouldn't show that to anyone

985
00:45:11.447 --> 00:45:13.362
or we'll have a treasure
hunt on our hands.

986
00:45:13.493 --> 00:45:14.886
What?

987
00:45:15.016 --> 00:45:16.452
If people think there's
a buried treasure.

988
00:45:16.583 --> 00:45:17.671
they're gonna be digging up
your grandfather's garden.

989
00:45:17.802 --> 00:45:18.759
You think there's
buried treasure?

990
00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:19.717
Of course I don't.
Of course I don't.

991
00:45:19.847 --> 00:45:21.066
I'm just saying what can happen

992
00:45:21.196 --> 00:45:22.763
when a silly rumor gets started.

993
00:45:22.894 --> 00:45:25.374
especially in a small town.

994
00:45:25.505 --> 00:45:26.593
Best keep it to yourself.

995
00:45:27.681 --> 00:45:28.726
Right.

996
00:45:28.856 --> 00:45:30.989
I am on a course all weekend.

997
00:45:31.119 --> 00:45:32.686
18 holes a day. if
you know what I mean.

998
00:45:33.774 --> 00:45:34.644
Fore!

999
00:45:39.171 --> 00:45:41.216
Just gimme a moment. I'm
just gonna go freshen up.

1000
00:45:42.304 --> 00:45:43.218
Sure.

1001
00:46:12.117 --> 00:46:13.771
So Mr. MacGraw.

1002
00:46:15.207 --> 00:46:16.730
It's Friday.

1003
00:46:16.861 --> 00:46:17.905
Let's celebrate.

1004
00:46:18.036 --> 00:46:20.038
What exactly are
we celebrating?

1005
00:46:20.168 --> 00:46:22.518
You came into a
very nice inheritance.

1006
00:46:22.649 --> 00:46:24.564
thanks to your grandfather.

1007
00:46:24.694 --> 00:46:26.479
I'd rather have him
than the inheritance. So.

1008
00:46:26.609 --> 00:46:29.134
Of course. Yeah.

1009
00:46:29.264 --> 00:46:30.439
There's a bar just
around the corner.

1010
00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:32.354
- I'll buy.
- Oh no.

1011
00:46:32.485 --> 00:46:34.226
I think I really am gonna
have an early night.

1012
00:46:34.356 --> 00:46:35.575
But thank you.

1013
00:46:35.705 --> 00:46:36.706
No date with Samantha?

1014
00:46:36.837 --> 00:46:39.100
It was a business dinner.

1015
00:46:39.231 --> 00:46:42.190
If you see her
again. as Daddy said.

1016
00:46:42.321 --> 00:46:43.713
just don't mention
anything about key.

1017
00:46:43.844 --> 00:46:45.715
Not until we know what it opens.

1018
00:46:45.846 --> 00:46:47.935
Well. Sam's the one
who found the key.

1019
00:46:48.066 --> 00:46:49.284
Tomorrow we're heading
over to the property

1020
00:46:49.415 --> 00:46:51.721
and we're gonna see if we
can unlock the mystery.

1021
00:46:51.852 --> 00:46:52.679
So to speak.

1022
00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:54.681
Sounds like fun.

1023
00:46:54.812 --> 00:46:55.856
I'll come help.

1024
00:46:55.987 --> 00:46:57.597
I wouldn't bother.

1025
00:46:57.727 --> 00:46:58.903
I honestly don't think
we're gonna find anything.

1026
00:46:59.033 --> 00:47:00.339
As your council.

1027
00:47:00.469 --> 00:47:02.210
I would strongly caution

1028
00:47:02.341 --> 00:47:05.039
against sharing the
hunt with civilians.

1029
00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:06.432
Well. we'll see.

1030
00:47:06.562 --> 00:47:08.216
You know.

1031
00:47:08.347 --> 00:47:10.828
how about we just go somewhere
more comfortable to wrap up?

1032
00:47:11.916 --> 00:47:12.830
I could use a drink.

1033
00:47:13.918 --> 00:47:14.788
Sure.

1034
00:47:14.919 --> 00:47:16.398
Why not?

1035
00:47:16.529 --> 00:47:17.965
So do you miss the city?

1036
00:47:19.532 --> 00:47:20.881
Not really.

1037
00:47:21.012 --> 00:47:22.317
Actually. I'm kind of
enjoying the break.

1038
00:47:22.448 --> 00:47:24.015
- Really?
- Yeah.

1039
00:47:24.145 --> 00:47:25.668
- Oh.
- Oh. you all right?

1040
00:47:25.799 --> 00:47:28.062
These heels are awful.

1041
00:47:28.193 --> 00:47:29.281
Yeah. I don't know
how women wear them.

1042
00:47:29.411 --> 00:47:30.717
They look so uncomfortable.

1043
00:47:30.848 --> 00:47:32.806
We're slaves to fashion.

1044
00:47:32.937 --> 00:47:34.808
I wear them 'cause people
say I look like a model

1045
00:47:34.939 --> 00:47:36.505
when I wear high heels.

1046
00:47:36.636 --> 00:47:38.116
Do you think I
could have modeled?

1047
00:47:38.246 --> 00:47:40.118
I'm sure you could have.

1048
00:47:40.248 --> 00:47:42.598
Coming from you.
that's such a compliment.

1049
00:47:42.729 --> 00:47:45.297
Seeing your work. you
look good in everything.

1050
00:47:45.427 --> 00:47:47.473
It's good genes. I guess.

1051
00:47:47.603 --> 00:47:49.040
I bet you look
good in jeans too.

1052
00:47:51.738 --> 00:47:52.652
This us?

1053
00:47:52.782 --> 00:47:53.740
This is it.

1054
00:48:00.007 --> 00:48:01.443
- Oh.
- Thanks.

1055
00:48:01.574 --> 00:48:02.401
Thank you.

1056
00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:07.493
Excuse me. But are you the
guy on those Viking novels?

1057
00:48:07.623 --> 00:48:08.755
No.

1058
00:48:08.886 --> 00:48:10.278
Yes. Yes.
That's him.

1059
00:48:10.409 --> 00:48:11.453
I knew it was you.

1060
00:48:11.584 --> 00:48:12.628
I mean. him.

1061
00:48:12.759 --> 00:48:14.630
She's kidding.
I'm an architect.

1062
00:48:14.761 --> 00:48:17.068
A very handsome architect.

1063
00:48:17.198 --> 00:48:18.721
Okay.

1064
00:48:18.852 --> 00:48:20.114
Who's also a Viking.

1065
00:48:20.245 --> 00:48:21.724
Okay. Now you're
just embarrassing me.

1066
00:48:21.855 --> 00:48:23.683
It's not every day a guy
like you walks into my office.

1067
00:48:23.813 --> 00:48:24.814
Or probably her bar.

1068
00:48:26.512 --> 00:48:27.556
Okay. Mr. Viking.

1069
00:48:27.687 --> 00:48:29.602
you've seen how much
property you own.

1070
00:48:29.732 --> 00:48:30.690
What do you think?

1071
00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:31.952
I might take your dad's advice

1072
00:48:32.083 --> 00:48:33.867
and just let the
whole portfolio ride.

1073
00:48:33.998 --> 00:48:35.434
As much as I'd love if
you moved to Sylvan Lake.

1074
00:48:35.564 --> 00:48:36.609
I get it.

1075
00:48:36.739 --> 00:48:38.567
You've got a great career.

1076
00:48:38.698 --> 00:48:40.918
Plus your modeling work.

1077
00:48:41.048 --> 00:48:42.049
You know. I did
always love it here

1078
00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:43.572
when I was a kid. though.

1079
00:48:43.703 --> 00:48:45.661
Hmm.

1080
00:48:45.792 --> 00:48:47.881
It can wear
thin after a while.

1081
00:48:48.012 --> 00:48:49.056
You don't like it here?

1082
00:48:51.232 --> 00:48:52.103
Sure.

1083
00:48:55.802 --> 00:49:00.024
Business is good and
summers are nice.

1084
00:49:00.154 --> 00:49:02.287
But you don't seem happy.

1085
00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:05.638
I'm fine.

1086
00:49:05.768 --> 00:49:08.641
You know.
I'll tell you what.

1087
00:49:08.771 --> 00:49:11.949
if I need cheering up.
I'll come visit you.

1088
00:49:12.079 --> 00:49:13.080
Oh?

1089
00:49:13.211 --> 00:49:14.908
- Cheers.
- Yeah.

1090
00:49:15.039 --> 00:49:17.780
To a successful day.

1091
00:49:17.911 --> 00:49:19.130
It was a good day. wasn't it?

1092
00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:21.915
It was. For the both of us.

1093
00:49:22.046 --> 00:49:24.135
And now that you're
a wealthy landowner.

1094
00:49:25.919 --> 00:49:26.964
hopefully you'll let me
continue handling your affairs.

1095
00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:31.011
My affairs?

1096
00:49:32.708 --> 00:49:34.536
Business affairs.

1097
00:49:34.667 --> 00:49:36.103
Business.

1098
00:49:36.234 --> 00:49:37.713
Yes.

1099
00:49:37.844 --> 00:49:38.888
Unless...

1100
00:49:41.979 --> 00:49:43.328
you had something
else in mind.

1101
00:49:46.548 --> 00:49:47.636
How long do you
think it's gonna take

1102
00:49:47.767 --> 00:49:49.595
to wrap up the
probate on the estate?

1103
00:49:49.725 --> 00:49:51.249
Not long.

1104
00:49:51.379 --> 00:49:52.554
And the missing letters?

1105
00:49:52.685 --> 00:49:53.686
They'll show up.

1106
00:49:53.816 --> 00:49:54.687
We'll figure it out.

1107
00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:57.429
All right.

1108
00:49:57.559 --> 00:49:58.560
I'm hoping that
this is gonna turn

1109
00:49:58.691 --> 00:50:00.823
into a long and
profitable relationship.

1110
00:50:00.954 --> 00:50:03.652
Yeah. Well. we'll see.

1111
00:50:03.783 --> 00:50:04.653
Let's let loose.

1112
00:50:04.784 --> 00:50:05.872
Get to know each other.

1113
00:50:06.003 --> 00:50:07.004
Okay. What would
you like to know?

1114
00:50:07.134 --> 00:50:08.744
For starters.

1115
00:50:08.875 --> 00:50:10.224
do you often get recognized?

1116
00:50:12.835 --> 00:50:14.185
Yeah. Sometimes.

1117
00:50:14.315 --> 00:50:16.839
You know. I try not to
make a big deal of it.

1118
00:50:16.970 --> 00:50:18.798
What does your partner think?

1119
00:50:18.928 --> 00:50:22.367
Oh. yeah. No
girlfriend. no partner.

1120
00:50:22.497 --> 00:50:24.630
Hmm. Really?

1121
00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.327
I find that hard to believe.

1122
00:50:26.458 --> 00:50:27.981
An attractive man like you.

1123
00:50:28.112 --> 00:50:30.114
Yeah. Well. you know.
I'm very busy with work

1124
00:50:30.244 --> 00:50:32.725
and. you know.
traveling for modeling.

1125
00:50:32.855 --> 00:50:34.683
It's not a lotta time to date.

1126
00:50:34.814 --> 00:50:37.643
Is there somebody
special in your life?

1127
00:50:37.773 --> 00:50:39.906
There was someone
once. but. yeah.

1128
00:50:40.037 --> 00:50:41.255
it's all over now.

1129
00:50:41.386 --> 00:50:43.997
What happened?

1130
00:50:44.128 --> 00:50:46.217
I'd say it was
more lust than love.

1131
00:50:47.957 --> 00:50:49.785
What's wrong with lust?

1132
00:51:12.156 --> 00:51:13.635
Hello?

1133
00:51:13.766 --> 00:51:15.246
Morning.

1134
00:51:15.376 --> 00:51:17.552
Just wanted to see how
you're feeling this morning.

1135
00:51:17.683 --> 00:51:19.511
Oh. I'm fine.

1136
00:51:19.641 --> 00:51:21.643
I think.

1137
00:51:21.774 --> 00:51:24.342
To be honest.
I don't remember much.

1138
00:51:24.472 --> 00:51:25.778
What happened?

1139
00:51:25.908 --> 00:51:28.259
Oh. you were very drunk.

1140
00:51:28.389 --> 00:51:31.610
And a little too forward.

1141
00:51:33.786 --> 00:51:34.743
Oh.

1142
00:51:34.874 --> 00:51:36.136
I did take your keys.

1143
00:51:37.355 --> 00:51:38.443
Oh. thanks.

1144
00:51:39.661 --> 00:51:41.054
I appreciate that.

1145
00:51:41.185 --> 00:51:43.230
Speaking of keys.

1146
00:51:43.361 --> 00:51:45.537
I just wanted to remind you
not to do anything impulsive

1147
00:51:45.667 --> 00:51:47.365
with that old key.

1148
00:51:47.495 --> 00:51:48.279
Right? Uh huh.

1149
00:51:49.932 --> 00:51:51.108
I hope I can see you later.

1150
00:51:52.935 --> 00:51:54.459
Yeah. I'll have
to see how I feel.

1151
00:51:55.721 --> 00:51:57.288
I'll see you at the office.

1152
00:51:57.418 --> 00:51:58.680
Promise?

1153
00:51:58.811 --> 00:51:59.638
Yeah. Promise.

1154
00:52:01.161 --> 00:52:02.031
Bye.

1155
00:52:09.648 --> 00:52:10.518
Oh!

1156
00:52:12.868 --> 00:52:14.522
Oh no!

1157
00:52:14.653 --> 00:52:15.828
Hello?

1158
00:52:15.958 --> 00:52:17.308
Good morning.

1159
00:52:17.438 --> 00:52:18.744
Ah. Yeah.
That's debatable.

1160
00:52:18.874 --> 00:52:20.485
What? What happened?

1161
00:52:20.615 --> 00:52:23.270
Apparently I painted
the town red last night.

1162
00:52:23.401 --> 00:52:25.403
Oh dear.
Good company. I hope.

1163
00:52:25.533 --> 00:52:26.665
Meeting with my lawyer.

1164
00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:29.058
Oh. Lauren?

1165
00:52:29.189 --> 00:52:31.060
Yeah. But it was just
a business meeting.

1166
00:52:32.671 --> 00:52:34.325
With a few too many
celebratory drinks.

1167
00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:36.762
Where are you now?

1168
00:52:36.892 --> 00:52:38.067
The Anchor Inn.

1169
00:52:38.198 --> 00:52:39.112
Look. I'm not sure
if I'm gonna be able

1170
00:52:39.243 --> 00:52:40.983
to go to the house today.

1171
00:52:41.114 --> 00:52:42.811
Let's do it another time.

1172
00:52:42.942 --> 00:52:43.725
Oh. well. I've
made a picnic lunch.

1173
00:52:45.771 --> 00:52:46.685
Well...

1174
00:52:48.208 --> 00:52:49.644
And I've got some
ideas about the key.

1175
00:52:49.775 --> 00:52:51.298
Really?

1176
00:52:51.429 --> 00:52:52.647
Amazing.

1177
00:52:52.778 --> 00:52:54.127
So I've been
looking through one

1178
00:52:54.258 --> 00:52:55.694
of your grandfather's
old books about the town.

1179
00:52:55.824 --> 00:52:57.870
There's pictures of the mansion
and some of your ancestors.

1180
00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.437
I'd really love to see that.

1181
00:52:59.567 --> 00:53:01.787
Do you remember
an old ice house?

1182
00:53:01.917 --> 00:53:03.658
No. but I do remember
there was a big fridge

1183
00:53:03.789 --> 00:53:05.138
in the kitchen.

1184
00:53:05.269 --> 00:53:06.966
I used to sneak a slice
of the chef's apple pie

1185
00:53:07.096 --> 00:53:08.576
every night before bead.

1186
00:53:08.707 --> 00:53:10.012
It was so good.

1187
00:53:10.143 --> 00:53:11.449
Okay. So it might
be a wild goose chase.

1188
00:53:11.579 --> 00:53:13.625
but we could look
for the ice house.

1189
00:53:13.755 --> 00:53:17.324
Or maybe any storage room
or maybe the basement.

1190
00:53:17.455 --> 00:53:18.630
Sounds like you have a plan.

1191
00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:19.805
Oh. I do.

1192
00:53:19.935 --> 00:53:20.806
Aren't you excited?

1193
00:53:20.936 --> 00:53:22.024
Absolutely.

1194
00:53:22.155 --> 00:53:23.243
Could you maybe gimme an hour?

1195
00:53:23.374 --> 00:53:24.418
Well. I will pick you up

1196
00:53:24.549 --> 00:53:28.335
and I will bring
coffee and water.

1197
00:53:28.466 --> 00:53:29.684
Sounds good.

1198
00:54:15.861 --> 00:54:17.166
Come on.

1199
00:54:17.297 --> 00:54:18.733
Let's go find that
hidden treasure.

1200
00:54:20.866 --> 00:54:23.347
Just gonna finish
my coffee here first.

1201
00:54:23.477 --> 00:54:24.522
Let's go.

1202
00:54:24.652 --> 00:54:25.610
Mm-hm.

1203
00:54:26.741 --> 00:54:27.655
Coming.

1204
00:54:34.401 --> 00:54:36.447
How do you have so much energy?

1205
00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:43.541
Come on.
Take a seat.

1206
00:54:43.671 --> 00:54:45.282
Mm. Sitting sounds good.

1207
00:54:47.719 --> 00:54:48.807
Okay.

1208
00:54:48.937 --> 00:54:49.938
Why don't you look at
these family photos

1209
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.765
and I'm gonna go
find the ice house.

1210
00:54:50.896 --> 00:54:51.897
Okay?

1211
00:54:52.027 --> 00:54:52.941
Sounds good.

1212
00:54:53.072 --> 00:54:54.203
Now we're getting to work.

1213
00:54:54.334 --> 00:54:55.248
Yes ma'am.

1214
00:55:19.751 --> 00:55:21.361
He is your iced
tea. Mr. MacGraw.

1215
00:55:25.322 --> 00:55:26.323
Are you all right?

1216
00:55:27.585 --> 00:55:28.499
Yeah. Yeah.

1217
00:55:29.717 --> 00:55:31.719
I must have been dreaming.

1218
00:55:31.850 --> 00:55:33.591
You were in a maid outfit.

1219
00:55:33.721 --> 00:55:34.679
No maid.

1220
00:55:36.898 --> 00:55:38.204
Thank you.

1221
00:55:38.335 --> 00:55:39.640
Oh. did you find any
of the hidden treasure?

1222
00:55:39.771 --> 00:55:40.946
No ice house.

1223
00:55:41.076 --> 00:55:42.991
There's an old garage.
but the door is locked.

1224
00:55:43.122 --> 00:55:43.949
You know. it's funny.

1225
00:55:44.079 --> 00:55:46.038
Looking at these photos.

1226
00:55:46.168 --> 00:55:48.040
it reminds me of when
I was here as a kid.

1227
00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:51.652
People really knew how
to enjoy themselves.

1228
00:55:56.091 --> 00:55:58.746
Man. this is quite
the spread. Thank you.

1229
00:56:03.534 --> 00:56:04.361
Mm.

1230
00:56:05.753 --> 00:56:06.928
I'm gonna miss this place.

1231
00:56:08.495 --> 00:56:09.366
It's beautiful.

1232
00:56:10.541 --> 00:56:12.064
It's got so much potential.

1233
00:56:12.194 --> 00:56:13.935
As what?

1234
00:56:14.066 --> 00:56:16.198
I was thinking maybe
a boutique hotel.

1235
00:56:16.329 --> 00:56:17.548
Hmm.

1236
00:56:17.678 --> 00:56:19.550
The lawyers don't
want me to sell.

1237
00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:21.552
Why?

1238
00:56:21.682 --> 00:56:22.814
They want me to throw it in

1239
00:56:22.944 --> 00:56:24.729
with the rest of the
rental properties.

1240
00:56:24.859 --> 00:56:26.644
I don't wanna overstep.

1241
00:56:26.774 --> 00:56:29.298
but I don't really know
if I would trust them.

1242
00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:31.388
Yeah. Maybe not.

1243
00:56:33.215 --> 00:56:35.392
Though it probably would take
a lot to get it up to code.

1244
00:56:35.522 --> 00:56:36.567
Yeah. but it'd be worth it.

1245
00:56:36.697 --> 00:56:39.047
Yeah. if I was here.

1246
00:56:39.178 --> 00:56:41.093
Well. why wouldn't you?

1247
00:56:41.223 --> 00:56:43.225
I've been offered a
promotion from the firm.

1248
00:56:43.356 --> 00:56:44.792
- Congratulations!
- Thanks.

1249
00:56:44.923 --> 00:56:48.753
And apparently I own a bunch
of buildings downtown too.

1250
00:56:48.883 --> 00:56:50.058
It's funny. I've been thinking

1251
00:56:50.189 --> 00:56:53.584
maybe I could start
my own business here.

1252
00:56:53.714 --> 00:56:54.933
But it is a small town.

1253
00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:58.719
How do you make it work?

1254
00:56:58.850 --> 00:57:01.287
Well. I have to get
pretty creative sometimes.

1255
00:57:01.418 --> 00:57:04.029
You know. with eBooks
and online book sales

1256
00:57:04.159 --> 00:57:05.204
and all these big box stores.

1257
00:57:05.334 --> 00:57:06.553
It's tough.

1258
00:57:06.684 --> 00:57:07.685
You know. people
still like to browse

1259
00:57:07.815 --> 00:57:08.990
and there's nothing like holding

1260
00:57:09.121 --> 00:57:11.819
a real book in your
hands. right? So.

1261
00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:13.560
It always helps to like
have a clever title

1262
00:57:13.691 --> 00:57:15.606
or an attractive cover.

1263
00:57:15.736 --> 00:57:17.216
like your latest Viking book.

1264
00:57:18.913 --> 00:57:21.742
Hey. I didn't write it.
I'm just on the cover so...

1265
00:57:26.094 --> 00:57:28.009
I've actually been thinking
about getting outta modeling.

1266
00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:29.837
I wanna focus on other
things in my life.

1267
00:57:31.665 --> 00:57:33.058
Sorry. we were talking
about the bookshop

1268
00:57:33.188 --> 00:57:35.190
and now we're suddenly
talking about me again.

1269
00:57:36.365 --> 00:57:37.671
It's okay.

1270
00:57:37.802 --> 00:57:38.672
I'll let it slide
just this one time.

1271
00:57:41.893 --> 00:57:42.981
You know. truth is.

1272
00:57:43.111 --> 00:57:45.200
I've been finding this
a little overwhelming.

1273
00:57:45.331 --> 00:57:47.942
Losing my grandfather and
inheriting the estate.

1274
00:57:48.073 --> 00:57:51.032
It's not easy. You have a
lot of big decisions to make.

1275
00:57:52.904 --> 00:57:54.688
How did you manage?

1276
00:57:54.819 --> 00:57:56.298
Well. Tammy worked
for my parents.

1277
00:57:56.429 --> 00:57:58.126
so she helped me
learn the ropes.

1278
00:57:58.257 --> 00:58:02.479
And I just put my head
down and kept going.

1279
00:58:02.609 --> 00:58:03.523
I really admire you.

1280
00:58:04.698 --> 00:58:06.352
Thank you.

1281
00:58:06.483 --> 00:58:08.049
Yeah. it hasn't been easy.

1282
00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:09.573
The rent on the
building keeps going up

1283
00:58:09.703 --> 00:58:11.618
and I had to sell our house

1284
00:58:11.749 --> 00:58:13.664
and move into the room
above the bookstore.

1285
00:58:13.794 --> 00:58:14.795
Really?

1286
00:58:14.926 --> 00:58:15.796
It's not all that bad.

1287
00:58:15.927 --> 00:58:17.276
I actually really
love the space.

1288
00:58:17.406 --> 00:58:19.626
It's all like
old post and beam.

1289
00:58:19.757 --> 00:58:21.149
Nice.

1290
00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:22.673
You know a good architect
could probably turn it

1291
00:58:22.803 --> 00:58:24.065
into something really special.

1292
00:58:25.806 --> 00:58:28.853
Yeah. I think I could
recommend one. Yeah.

1293
00:58:28.983 --> 00:58:30.855
You know. our little
town has a lot to offer.

1294
00:58:32.509 --> 00:58:35.512
I'm starting to see that.

1295
00:58:52.485 --> 00:58:53.617
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1296
00:58:53.747 --> 00:58:55.619
So. next.

1297
00:58:55.749 --> 00:58:57.490
- Check the storage room?
- Sure.

1298
00:58:57.621 --> 00:58:58.839
Good.

1299
00:58:58.970 --> 00:59:00.101
There used to be a lotta
spiders down there.

1300
00:59:00.232 --> 00:59:01.407
- Seriously?
- Oh yeah.

1301
00:59:01.538 --> 00:59:03.104
Huge ones.

1302
00:59:03.235 --> 00:59:04.932
But you're not afraid. are you?

1303
00:59:05.063 --> 00:59:06.760
No. Of course not.

1304
00:59:06.891 --> 00:59:08.327
Oh good. All right.
Lead the way.

1305
00:59:11.199 --> 00:59:12.592
- Okay.
- All right.

1306
00:59:13.811 --> 00:59:15.334
What do we got here?

1307
00:59:30.044 --> 00:59:31.002
I've already checked the
cabinets and the drawers.

1308
00:59:31.132 --> 00:59:35.397
Oh. what about
fake walls? Panels?

1309
00:59:35.528 --> 00:59:37.095
Now you're talking.
I'll start on this side.

1310
00:59:37.225 --> 00:59:38.662
Okay. I'll start here.

1311
01:00:11.825 --> 01:00:13.871
One more sweep of the kitchen?

1312
01:00:14.001 --> 01:00:15.046
Yep.

1313
01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:28.407
Ah. our finest selection.

1314
01:00:28.537 --> 01:00:29.843
Dessert. ma'am?

1315
01:00:29.974 --> 01:00:32.150
How lovely. Just
a small one. please.

1316
01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:33.281
Thank you.

1317
01:00:33.412 --> 01:00:35.066
Oh. no calories. Perfect.

1318
01:00:38.896 --> 01:00:39.766
Onward?

1319
01:00:50.081 --> 01:00:52.300
These are all built with
locally quarried sandstone.

1320
01:00:53.388 --> 01:00:54.302
That's cool.

1321
01:01:00.004 --> 01:01:01.483
Okay. So we're making progress.

1322
01:01:01.614 --> 01:01:02.528
Uh-huh.

1323
01:01:06.619 --> 01:01:07.664
They used to host
all kinds of soirees

1324
01:01:07.794 --> 01:01:09.013
and formal events here.

1325
01:01:10.188 --> 01:01:11.493
Oh. what do we got?

1326
01:01:21.808 --> 01:01:23.723
Pleased to meet your
acquaintance. Mr. MacGraw.

1327
01:01:23.854 --> 01:01:26.726
The pleasure's
all mine. madam.

1328
01:01:26.857 --> 01:01:28.815
Welcome to the mystery mansion.

1329
01:01:28.946 --> 01:01:30.556
I heard there's
a hidden treasure.

1330
01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:34.212
This key is...

1331
01:01:34.342 --> 01:01:35.735
The key to...

1332
01:01:35.866 --> 01:01:36.693
Untold fortune.

1333
01:01:37.824 --> 01:01:39.043
Or perhaps...

1334
01:01:39.173 --> 01:01:40.261
Absolutely nothing.

1335
01:01:42.263 --> 01:01:44.352
Or maybe...

1336
01:01:44.483 --> 01:01:46.006
Key to someone's heart.

1337
01:01:46.137 --> 01:01:48.139
You're such a romantic.

1338
01:01:50.054 --> 01:01:51.011
Shall we dance?

1339
01:02:42.846 --> 01:02:44.456
I haven't this much
fun in a long time.

1340
01:02:45.979 --> 01:02:48.416
I bet you say that
to all your wenches.

1341
01:02:49.853 --> 01:02:51.550
I'm gonna get an ice tea.

1342
01:03:09.437 --> 01:03:11.613
This key has to fit something.

1343
01:03:11.744 --> 01:03:13.877
We have to keep looking.

1344
01:03:14.007 --> 01:03:14.791
It's a big mansion.
It could be anywhere.

1345
01:03:22.711 --> 01:03:23.974
Maybe not anywhere.

1346
01:03:25.497 --> 01:03:26.759
What is it?

1347
01:03:26.890 --> 01:03:27.934
I have an idea.

1348
01:03:38.553 --> 01:03:39.511
What is it?

1349
01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:43.689
One sec.

1350
01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:44.777
Josh!

1351
01:03:49.521 --> 01:03:51.479
Okay. We're looking
for a key to the shed.

1352
01:03:51.610 --> 01:03:52.567
Mm-hm.

1353
01:03:57.355 --> 01:03:58.356
Oh!

1354
01:04:00.967 --> 01:04:02.577
One of these has to be the key.

1355
01:04:02.708 --> 01:04:04.579
- I'll take 'em all.
- Let's go.

1356
01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:08.583
- No.
- Try these ones.

1357
01:04:08.714 --> 01:04:09.802
All right.

1358
01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:16.243
- Yes!
- Yes!

1359
01:04:25.774 --> 01:04:26.863
Lotta memories here.

1360
01:04:28.908 --> 01:04:29.735
This isn't it.

1361
01:04:43.444 --> 01:04:44.793
What is it?

1362
01:04:44.924 --> 01:04:46.839
It's a mystery
wrapped in canvas.

1363
01:04:48.362 --> 01:04:49.320
I think...

1364
01:04:57.719 --> 01:04:58.546
My grandfather's sailboat.

1365
01:04:58.677 --> 01:05:01.375
Wow. It's beautiful.

1366
01:05:01.506 --> 01:05:02.637
He loved this boat.

1367
01:05:05.031 --> 01:05:05.902
Check this out.

1368
01:05:07.381 --> 01:05:09.688
Hey. I remember that heart.

1369
01:05:09.818 --> 01:05:10.819
What do you mean?

1370
01:05:12.647 --> 01:05:13.648
We pillage the boat.

1371
01:05:14.998 --> 01:05:16.651
Treasure's gotta
be here somewhere.

1372
01:05:16.782 --> 01:05:17.696
Come on.

1373
01:05:38.847 --> 01:05:39.805
Okay.

1374
01:05:44.897 --> 01:05:46.159
You do the honors.

1375
01:05:46.290 --> 01:05:47.160
Really?

1376
01:05:48.292 --> 01:05:49.249
Yeah.

1377
01:05:53.819 --> 01:05:55.125
It fits. but it doesn't turn.

1378
01:05:56.387 --> 01:05:57.562
Wait. I have an idea.

1379
01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:02.741
Okay.

1380
01:06:09.052 --> 01:06:10.618
Try this.

1381
01:06:10.749 --> 01:06:11.663
Oh.

1382
01:06:14.405 --> 01:06:15.884
The oil'll take a
little time to work.

1383
01:06:17.495 --> 01:06:18.365
Drink while we wait?

1384
01:06:18.496 --> 01:06:19.410
- Sure.
- Okay.

1385
01:06:28.941 --> 01:06:30.203
Cheers.

1386
01:06:30.334 --> 01:06:31.639
We don't even know
what's in it yet.

1387
01:06:31.770 --> 01:06:33.293
We will soon.

1388
01:06:33.424 --> 01:06:35.774
To sailing and strong winds.

1389
01:06:39.865 --> 01:06:40.997
Hi. guys.

1390
01:06:41.127 --> 01:06:42.520
Josh.

1391
01:06:42.650 --> 01:06:44.478
Samantha.

1392
01:06:44.609 --> 01:06:45.871
What are you doing?

1393
01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:48.091
I think we found what
we were looking for.

1394
01:06:48.221 --> 01:06:49.396
We just can't get it open.

1395
01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:51.746
I knew you wouldn't
take my advice

1396
01:06:51.877 --> 01:06:53.792
about keeping the key a secret.

1397
01:06:53.922 --> 01:06:55.968
Well. I wouldn't have
found it without Sam. So.

1398
01:06:56.099 --> 01:06:58.797
You know. as
executor of the estate.

1399
01:06:58.927 --> 01:07:00.451
I'll take care of this.

1400
01:07:00.581 --> 01:07:02.496
I'll get a certified
locksmith to open it

1401
01:07:02.627 --> 01:07:05.021
and then we can review
the contents at my office.

1402
01:07:06.326 --> 01:07:07.371
Okay.

1403
01:07:07.501 --> 01:07:09.677
Had a lotta fun last night.

1404
01:07:09.808 --> 01:07:12.985
Here are your car keys.

1405
01:07:14.726 --> 01:07:15.596
Later. Josh.

1406
01:07:19.992 --> 01:07:21.689
Yeah. I think
I'm just gonna go.

1407
01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:23.604
Sam!

1408
01:07:23.735 --> 01:07:24.605
Wait!

1409
01:07:34.441 --> 01:07:35.877
So Josh and I.

1410
01:07:36.008 --> 01:07:36.835
we went to the MacGraw
mansion and we had a picnic.

1411
01:07:36.965 --> 01:07:38.315
That's good.

1412
01:07:38.445 --> 01:07:39.403
Yeah. You know. and we
had a lotta fun looking

1413
01:07:39.533 --> 01:07:41.013
for the mystery key box.

1414
01:07:41.144 --> 01:07:42.797
And then we found a box in
his grandfather's sailboat.

1415
01:07:42.928 --> 01:07:43.885
The key fit.

1416
01:07:44.016 --> 01:07:45.061
That's really good.

1417
01:07:45.191 --> 01:07:46.801
Then Lauren shows up.

1418
01:07:46.932 --> 01:07:49.065
- Not so good.
- She ruined everything.

1419
01:07:49.195 --> 01:07:50.849
You know. I thought Josh
and I had something going.

1420
01:07:50.979 --> 01:07:52.068
And then she took the box

1421
01:07:52.198 --> 01:07:53.199
because she's in
charge of the estate.

1422
01:07:53.330 --> 01:07:54.200
And I just. I don't know.

1423
01:07:54.331 --> 01:07:55.462
I just don't trust her.

1424
01:07:55.593 --> 01:07:58.074
But Josh seems to
think she's okay.

1425
01:07:58.204 --> 01:08:00.206
I mean. maybe more than okay.

1426
01:08:00.337 --> 01:08:02.339
Well. hey. there's always
another book on the shelf.

1427
01:08:02.469 --> 01:08:03.862
Tammy.

1428
01:08:03.992 --> 01:08:06.691
I hope it's not me that
gets left on the shelf.

1429
01:08:06.821 --> 01:08:07.909
I mean. what am I gonna do?

1430
01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:09.694
I thought I found a good man.

1431
01:08:09.824 --> 01:08:11.478
Someone I'm actually
interested in.

1432
01:08:12.697 --> 01:08:14.438
Give it time. Sam.

1433
01:08:14.568 --> 01:08:15.482
I'm sure he'll come round.

1434
01:08:15.613 --> 01:08:17.049
She's a very shallow person.

1435
01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:18.094
He'll figure it out.

1436
01:08:18.224 --> 01:08:19.443
You think so?

1437
01:08:19.573 --> 01:08:20.400
I have no idea.

1438
01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:25.013
But I do know that if two
people are meant to be together.

1439
01:08:25.144 --> 01:08:26.363
they will be.

1440
01:08:26.493 --> 01:08:30.018
The course of true love
never did run smooth.

1441
01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:32.020
Shakespeare. "A
Midsummer Night's Dream."

1442
01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:34.066
You got it.
Now it's time to open.

1443
01:08:34.197 --> 01:08:35.937
We have customers coming
and books to sell.

1444
01:08:37.243 --> 01:08:40.116
Yeah. You're right.

1445
01:09:22.593 --> 01:09:24.638
Found Books. Samantha
Hill speaking.

1446
01:09:24.769 --> 01:09:26.118
Sam. It's Josh.

1447
01:09:26.249 --> 01:09:27.685
Look. I'm in the
city for business.

1448
01:09:27.815 --> 01:09:29.556
but I just wanted to call

1449
01:09:29.687 --> 01:09:32.168
and explain what happened
between Lauren and I that night.

1450
01:09:33.908 --> 01:09:34.996
Okay. So what
did happen. Josh?

1451
01:09:37.129 --> 01:09:38.826
I know what Lauren implied.

1452
01:09:38.957 --> 01:09:40.828
And. yes. I'd had too much to
drink. but nothing happened.

1453
01:09:42.743 --> 01:09:43.657
I swear.

1454
01:09:44.832 --> 01:09:46.182
I don't know if I believe you.

1455
01:09:47.922 --> 01:09:49.097
Sam. I'm telling
you the truth.

1456
01:09:56.061 --> 01:09:58.281
You can do whatever you
like with whomever you like.

1457
01:09:58.411 --> 01:09:59.412
I don't care.

1458
01:09:59.543 --> 01:10:00.544
You don't care?

1459
01:10:00.674 --> 01:10:02.546
Look. I have
customers right now.

1460
01:10:02.676 --> 01:10:04.200
I just. I don't
have time for this.

1461
01:10:04.330 --> 01:10:05.331
I'm sorry. I have to go.

1462
01:10:06.506 --> 01:10:08.204
- Bye.
- Sam--

1463
01:10:26.831 --> 01:10:28.833
Hello. Lauren Lawrence here.

1464
01:10:28.963 --> 01:10:30.226
Lauren. It's Josh.

1465
01:10:31.836 --> 01:10:34.578
Josh. Nice to hear your voice.

1466
01:10:34.708 --> 01:10:37.145
Daddy was relieved you
found the mystery box.

1467
01:10:38.756 --> 01:10:39.626
Oh good.

1468
01:10:40.801 --> 01:10:42.020
What was inside?

1469
01:10:42.150 --> 01:10:43.804
You'll have to come
here and find out.

1470
01:10:43.935 --> 01:10:45.197
It's a surprise.

1471
01:10:45.328 --> 01:10:46.329
Well. I'll be
back in a few days

1472
01:10:46.459 --> 01:10:47.591
and I'd really like to get all

1473
01:10:47.721 --> 01:10:49.680
this estate business
wrapped up ASAP.

1474
01:10:49.810 --> 01:10:51.551
I like it when you
tell me what to do.

1475
01:10:52.857 --> 01:10:54.772
I just wanna get
on with things.

1476
01:10:54.902 --> 01:10:57.035
I thought we might
grab dinner to celebrate.

1477
01:10:57.165 --> 01:10:59.472
You know. I think
it'd be better

1478
01:10:59.603 --> 01:11:01.257
if we just met at your
office and go from there.

1479
01:11:02.997 --> 01:11:04.564
Oh?

1480
01:11:04.695 --> 01:11:05.783
And I'd also like it

1481
01:11:05.913 --> 01:11:07.175
if your father could
be there as well.

1482
01:11:07.306 --> 01:11:09.613
All right.

1483
01:11:09.743 --> 01:11:10.744
Of course.

1484
01:11:29.807 --> 01:11:32.157
Oops.

1485
01:11:34.986 --> 01:11:36.683
Ah!

1486
01:11:36.814 --> 01:11:38.337
These darn Vikings.

1487
01:11:40.992 --> 01:11:42.994
I think the publisher is
really gonna like these ones.

1488
01:11:43.124 --> 01:11:44.125
- Great Viking!
- Yeah.

1489
01:11:45.518 --> 01:11:46.824
Well I'm glad it
turned out because

1490
01:11:48.565 --> 01:11:49.609
I think it's my last.

1491
01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:51.263
What?

1492
01:11:51.394 --> 01:11:52.569
What's going on. Josh?

1493
01:11:52.699 --> 01:11:53.831
I think I'm done
with modeling.

1494
01:11:53.961 --> 01:11:56.660
I mean. it can wear
on you after a while.

1495
01:11:56.790 --> 01:11:59.053
Is it about the promotion?

1496
01:11:59.184 --> 01:12:01.273
Just think it's
time for change.

1497
01:12:01.404 --> 01:12:03.057
A certain someone perhaps?

1498
01:12:04.668 --> 01:12:06.017
Yeah.

1499
01:12:06.147 --> 01:12:07.018
Something like that.

1500
01:12:08.454 --> 01:12:09.760
I'm gonna miss you.

1501
01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:11.718
You were everyone's
favorite Viking.

1502
01:12:11.849 --> 01:12:15.026
Not to mention cowboy.
warrior. hunter.

1503
01:12:16.244 --> 01:12:17.985
I'm gonna miss you too.

1504
01:12:18.116 --> 01:12:20.336
And I'm really gonna miss all
the cool costumes and makeup.

1505
01:12:20.466 --> 01:12:22.468
but don't you go
telling anyone. okay?

1506
01:12:22.599 --> 01:12:23.513
Our secret.

1507
01:12:25.079 --> 01:12:27.081
So what are you gonna do
about that certain someone?

1508
01:12:27.212 --> 01:12:31.216
Last time we spoke.
she hung up on me.

1509
01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:33.044
- So...
- Well. that's not good.

1510
01:12:33.174 --> 01:12:34.654
Have you thought
about flowers?

1511
01:12:34.785 --> 01:12:35.916
It always worked on me.

1512
01:12:37.396 --> 01:12:38.266
Right.

1513
01:12:38.397 --> 01:12:39.964
Hey. no regrets.

1514
01:12:40.094 --> 01:12:41.487
It was great while it lasted.

1515
01:12:41.618 --> 01:12:44.838
But honestly. Josh. I'm
just too into my career.

1516
01:12:44.969 --> 01:12:47.232
Whoever she is. she
must be someone special.

1517
01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:53.543
Yeah. she is.

1518
01:13:03.944 --> 01:13:06.512
Why are books so
afraid of their sequel?

1519
01:13:06.643 --> 01:13:07.774
Why?

1520
01:13:07.905 --> 01:13:09.254
Because they always
come after them.

1521
01:13:10.821 --> 01:13:12.866
These just arrived.

1522
01:13:12.997 --> 01:13:14.172
Cool.

1523
01:13:14.302 --> 01:13:16.130
Does it say who they're from?

1524
01:13:16.261 --> 01:13:17.567
As if we couldn't guess.

1525
01:13:19.743 --> 01:13:22.833
"For my key friend.
something to unlock your heart.

1526
01:13:22.963 --> 01:13:24.835
The Viking."

1527
01:13:24.965 --> 01:13:26.706
So romantic.

1528
01:13:26.837 --> 01:13:27.751
Oh. please.

1529
01:13:27.881 --> 01:13:29.666
That gives me an idea.

1530
01:13:29.796 --> 01:13:31.581
I wonder if the Viking would
do a promo appearance here.

1531
01:13:31.711 --> 01:13:33.844
You know. in full Viking stuff.

1532
01:13:33.974 --> 01:13:36.107
Oh. that is a great idea.

1533
01:13:36.237 --> 01:13:37.804
I mean. the cutout's good.

1534
01:13:37.935 --> 01:13:42.069
but Josh himself would really
bring the customers in.

1535
01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:43.157
Hmm.

1536
01:13:43.288 --> 01:13:44.985
It's worth a try. I guess.

1537
01:13:45.116 --> 01:13:47.684
I think you just wanna
see more of his chest.

1538
01:13:47.814 --> 01:13:49.425
Nah.

1539
01:13:49.555 --> 01:13:51.165
This is just business.

1540
01:13:51.296 --> 01:13:52.123
Here's Josh.

1541
01:13:54.952 --> 01:13:56.867
You're in
trouble. little missy.

1542
01:13:56.997 --> 01:13:57.781
Trouble with what?

1543
01:13:58.912 --> 01:13:59.913
Nothing.

1544
01:14:02.046 --> 01:14:03.656
You know. I was just
thinking about you.

1545
01:14:05.702 --> 01:14:07.007
That's nice.

1546
01:14:07.138 --> 01:14:09.096
I just got the roses.
They're lovely.

1547
01:14:09.227 --> 01:14:10.446
Thank you.

1548
01:14:10.576 --> 01:14:11.359
Well. it's the
least I could do.

1549
01:14:11.490 --> 01:14:12.970
Can I ask you something?

1550
01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:16.626
Would you mind coming to the
store and being a Viking?

1551
01:14:19.019 --> 01:14:19.977
Why?

1552
01:14:20.107 --> 01:14:21.413
Just to help with publicity.

1553
01:14:21.544 --> 01:14:23.067
I mean. if you'd prefer.

1554
01:14:23.197 --> 01:14:24.895
I can liaise through your
publisher's PR department.

1555
01:14:25.025 --> 01:14:28.246
I just. I thought it'd be
easier if I called you.

1556
01:14:28.376 --> 01:14:29.943
Well. as of today.

1557
01:14:30.074 --> 01:14:32.946
I kinda quit the Viking
business altogether.

1558
01:14:33.077 --> 01:14:33.991
Really?

1559
01:14:34.121 --> 01:14:35.253
What do you mean?

1560
01:14:35.383 --> 01:14:37.081
I'll be back
in Sylvan tomorrow.

1561
01:14:37.211 --> 01:14:38.691
I'll explain everything. Okay?

1562
01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:41.389
Okay.

1563
01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:42.782
Arrevederci!

1564
01:14:42.913 --> 01:14:44.567
A presto.

1565
01:14:51.922 --> 01:14:53.837
What are you two looking at?

1566
01:14:53.967 --> 01:14:54.881
Hm?

1567
01:14:59.843 --> 01:15:02.149
How was the drive last night?

1568
01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:04.848
Long. as usual.

1569
01:15:04.978 --> 01:15:07.590
Hopefully this won't take
long and then we can celebrate.

1570
01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:09.505
Good morning. Good morning.

1571
01:15:10.897 --> 01:15:12.856
Has Lauren showed
you the big surprise?

1572
01:15:12.986 --> 01:15:13.857
No. I just arrived.

1573
01:15:16.555 --> 01:15:17.774
Take a look.

1574
01:15:30.526 --> 01:15:31.701
What is this?

1575
01:15:34.355 --> 01:15:36.662
Your grandfather got his start
during the local gold rush.

1576
01:15:37.924 --> 01:15:39.012
I had no idea.

1577
01:15:43.147 --> 01:15:44.714
What is all this?

1578
01:15:44.844 --> 01:15:46.629
Oh. some old newspaper
clippings about your grandfather

1579
01:15:46.759 --> 01:15:48.544
winning a local
sailing club race.

1580
01:15:48.674 --> 01:15:49.936
You could have them framed.

1581
01:15:50.067 --> 01:15:51.721
It would make a nice
little memory pic.

1582
01:15:54.288 --> 01:15:55.463
And that's it. huh?

1583
01:15:55.594 --> 01:15:57.465
Mystery solved.
Mystery solved.

1584
01:16:07.563 --> 01:16:08.694
What are you doing?

1585
01:16:13.307 --> 01:16:14.918
The missing letter.

1586
01:16:15.048 --> 01:16:17.877
Three letters. Three letters.

1587
01:16:18.008 --> 01:16:19.792
We can count. Daddy.

1588
01:16:28.888 --> 01:16:30.324
Dear. Joshua.

1589
01:16:30.455 --> 01:16:32.413
I'm glad you followed the
trail and found the box.

1590
01:16:32.544 --> 01:16:34.633
Larry Lawrence made
me a lotta money.

1591
01:16:34.764 --> 01:16:36.592
but I never really trusted him.

1592
01:16:36.722 --> 01:16:38.855
Watch your back. Always.

1593
01:16:38.985 --> 01:16:39.769
Love and respect.
your grandfather.

1594
01:16:44.904 --> 01:16:46.079
What's it say? What's it say?

1595
01:16:47.559 --> 01:16:49.039
Just a private message
from my grandfather.

1596
01:16:49.169 --> 01:16:50.170
Huh?

1597
01:16:50.301 --> 01:16:52.042
More mystery. More mystery.

1598
01:17:10.364 --> 01:17:13.063
That looks like a
young Robert MacGraw.

1599
01:17:13.193 --> 01:17:15.761
I don't know who
the young woman is.

1600
01:17:15.892 --> 01:17:16.806
Huh.

1601
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:23.813
Dear. Robert.

1602
01:17:23.943 --> 01:17:26.642
I very much regret that
I cannot marry you.

1603
01:17:26.772 --> 01:17:28.861
I know this is not the
answer you wanted to hear.

1604
01:17:28.992 --> 01:17:31.124
but I have fallen in
love with Tom Hill.

1605
01:17:31.255 --> 01:17:33.823
I will always hold you
in the utmost affection.

1606
01:17:33.953 --> 01:17:36.608
With loving
friendship. Milly Dale.

1607
01:17:36.739 --> 01:17:39.611
This is about Tom
Hill and Milly Dale.

1608
01:17:39.742 --> 01:17:42.266
The original proprietors
of Found Books?

1609
01:17:42.396 --> 01:17:43.876
Sam's grandparents?

1610
01:17:54.408 --> 01:17:55.714
"Private.

1611
01:17:55.845 --> 01:17:57.150
Only to be opened
after my death.

1612
01:17:58.412 --> 01:17:59.718
Robert MacGraw."

1613
01:18:06.769 --> 01:18:07.944
My beloved Milly

1614
01:18:08.074 --> 01:18:10.860
would not accept my
proposal of marriage.

1615
01:18:10.990 --> 01:18:14.341
but we remained loving
friends our whole lives.

1616
01:18:14.472 --> 01:18:16.779
As a token of that love.
I leave her granddaughter.

1617
01:18:16.909 --> 01:18:17.997
Samantha Hill...

1618
01:18:18.128 --> 01:18:18.998
What does it say?

1619
01:18:22.828 --> 01:18:24.090
A holographic codicil.

1620
01:18:25.352 --> 01:18:27.267
How unusual! How unusual!

1621
01:18:29.139 --> 01:18:30.009
Is it legal?

1622
01:18:31.184 --> 01:18:32.446
Oh. yes. Yes.

1623
01:18:32.577 --> 01:18:33.709
Unless you. as the sole heir.
decide to contest it.

1624
01:18:35.754 --> 01:18:36.668
No.

1625
01:18:36.799 --> 01:18:37.669
Oh.

1626
01:18:47.374 --> 01:18:48.724
What's in the envelope?

1627
01:18:51.335 --> 01:18:52.249
What a surprise.

1628
01:18:55.556 --> 01:18:58.516
Josh. this is such
a romantic story.

1629
01:18:58.646 --> 01:18:59.735
I mean. when I said we
had a surprise for you.

1630
01:19:01.824 --> 01:19:03.608
I didn't expect it to be this.

1631
01:19:04.696 --> 01:19:06.219
I'm so excited for us.

1632
01:19:07.655 --> 01:19:09.527
Us?

1633
01:19:09.657 --> 01:19:11.224
All of us. All of us.

1634
01:19:11.355 --> 01:19:12.965
Now that the missing
letter has shown itself.

1635
01:19:13.096 --> 01:19:14.750
the execution of the will
should go quite quickly.

1636
01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:16.534
You can get back to
your architectural work

1637
01:19:16.664 --> 01:19:20.668
and the rental property
checks will start rolling in.

1638
01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:26.065
Time to celebrate.
Mr. MacGraw.

1639
01:19:26.196 --> 01:19:30.156
You know. actually. speaking
of the rental properties.

1640
01:19:30.287 --> 01:19:32.289
how do I get in contact
with the management company?

1641
01:19:32.419 --> 01:19:33.290
Oh. let me take care of that.

1642
01:19:35.074 --> 01:19:36.075
Like you did for
my grandfather?

1643
01:19:36.206 --> 01:19:38.730
Worked for him.
Worked for him.

1644
01:19:40.471 --> 01:19:42.125
What's the name of
the company. Larry?

1645
01:19:44.257 --> 01:19:46.651
Josh. let Daddy handle it.

1646
01:19:46.782 --> 01:19:49.045
Let's get a drink.

1647
01:19:49.175 --> 01:19:52.309
Yeah. The name of the company
is Sylvan Properties LLC.

1648
01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:55.181
What of it?

1649
01:19:55.312 --> 01:20:00.012
Well. I did some checking and

1650
01:20:00.143 --> 01:20:01.753
the owner is Laurence Lawrence.

1651
01:20:03.799 --> 01:20:04.930
Perfectly legal.

1652
01:20:06.497 --> 01:20:07.846
Perfectly legal.

1653
01:20:07.977 --> 01:20:09.326
Well. except when
you consider the fact

1654
01:20:09.456 --> 01:20:11.894
that. over the last 20 years.

1655
01:20:12.024 --> 01:20:14.810
all the checks you've
paid to my grandfather.

1656
01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:15.985
well. they haven't increased.

1657
01:20:18.248 --> 01:20:20.903
While rental fees
have almost doubled.

1658
01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:26.604
Your grandfather didn't care.

1659
01:20:26.734 --> 01:20:27.648
Well. I do.

1660
01:20:29.302 --> 01:20:31.522
I think you're greedy
and I don't trust you.

1661
01:20:33.829 --> 01:20:35.004
Perfectly legal.

1662
01:20:36.309 --> 01:20:38.007
- Perfectly.
- We'll let the courts decide.

1663
01:20:38.137 --> 01:20:39.486
I had an accountant
look through all

1664
01:20:39.617 --> 01:20:41.358
of my grandfather's records.

1665
01:20:41.488 --> 01:20:45.101
I'll be suing Sylvan
Properties LLC for fraud.

1666
01:20:45.231 --> 01:20:46.667
And effective immediately.

1667
01:20:46.798 --> 01:20:48.669
I'm terminating my
relationship with Lawrence Law.

1668
01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:50.193
Josh. please.

1669
01:20:50.323 --> 01:20:52.760
There must be something I
can do to smooth this over.

1670
01:20:52.891 --> 01:20:54.240
Like father. like daughter.

1671
01:20:56.634 --> 01:20:57.940
No. I'm not like him.

1672
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.941
What? What?

1673
01:20:59.071 --> 01:21:01.073
You're greedy.

1674
01:21:01.204 --> 01:21:02.509
My own daughter!

1675
01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:05.817
You manipulate and dominate
to get what you want.

1676
01:21:05.948 --> 01:21:08.602
You're a bully and I am tired
of trying to be like you.

1677
01:21:08.733 --> 01:21:10.866
Josh. please. Please.
please forgive me.

1678
01:21:10.996 --> 01:21:13.346
I had no idea what he was doing.

1679
01:21:13.477 --> 01:21:15.131
Liar!

1680
01:21:15.261 --> 01:21:16.828
You knew I was skimming the
profits off old man MacGraw.

1681
01:21:16.959 --> 01:21:17.829
You sat there and plotted

1682
01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:20.571
how you'd help me do it to Josh.

1683
01:21:20.701 --> 01:21:22.268
Please.

1684
01:21:22.399 --> 01:21:23.226
I can be different.

1685
01:21:25.445 --> 01:21:26.229
That's not me.

1686
01:21:27.578 --> 01:21:30.102
Nice try. Lauren.

1687
01:21:30.233 --> 01:21:32.452
But I think I have
everything I need.

1688
01:21:36.326 --> 01:21:37.675
I'll see you in court.

1689
01:21:37.805 --> 01:21:39.329
I'll see you in court.

1690
01:21:39.459 --> 01:21:40.547
In court!

1691
01:21:40.678 --> 01:21:41.592
In court!

1692
01:22:10.664 --> 01:22:11.535
Hi.

1693
01:22:11.665 --> 01:22:12.623
Hi.

1694
01:22:13.841 --> 01:22:16.061
So I have a lot to tell you.

1695
01:22:16.192 --> 01:22:17.367
Okay. what's going on?

1696
01:22:17.497 --> 01:22:18.542
Don't worry.

1697
01:22:18.672 --> 01:22:20.109
It's good news.

1698
01:22:20.239 --> 01:22:21.719
Okay.

1699
01:22:24.243 --> 01:22:28.987
For starters. I've
decided I'm gonna move back

1700
01:22:29.118 --> 01:22:30.989
to Sylvan Lake permanently.

1701
01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:32.425
What about your promotion?

1702
01:22:32.556 --> 01:22:34.079
I turned it down.

1703
01:22:34.210 --> 01:22:35.689
I'm leaving the firm.

1704
01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:38.779
I mean. that's great news.

1705
01:22:38.910 --> 01:22:40.651
To have you here
in town. it's...

1706
01:22:40.781 --> 01:22:42.479
Yeah.

1707
01:22:42.609 --> 01:22:43.741
I actually
think your talents

1708
01:22:43.871 --> 01:22:45.264
would be really good
for our community.

1709
01:22:46.744 --> 01:22:48.659
So it turns out
that you were right.

1710
01:22:48.789 --> 01:22:51.140
Lauren was only interested
in me because of the estate.

1711
01:22:52.619 --> 01:22:53.620
You should have seen
her eyes light up

1712
01:22:53.751 --> 01:22:56.058
when she saw the gold.

1713
01:22:56.188 --> 01:22:58.625
Yeah. it turns out
my grandfather didn't

1714
01:22:58.756 --> 01:22:59.887
just leave me property.

1715
01:23:03.239 --> 01:23:04.936
That's amazing.

1716
01:23:05.067 --> 01:23:05.981
And there's more.

1717
01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:10.159
There were three
letters in the box.

1718
01:23:10.289 --> 01:23:12.465
hidden under
a false bottom.

1719
01:23:12.596 --> 01:23:14.467
A false bottom?

1720
01:23:14.598 --> 01:23:17.035
This is sounding like something
out of a romance novel.

1721
01:23:19.211 --> 01:23:20.952
So I did a little sleuthing

1722
01:23:21.083 --> 01:23:22.345
and I found out that Larry
has been skimming money

1723
01:23:22.475 --> 01:23:24.347
off my grandfather's
properties for years.

1724
01:23:25.739 --> 01:23:26.566
Well. him and Lauren.

1725
01:23:27.828 --> 01:23:29.134
So I'll be seeing them in court.

1726
01:23:29.265 --> 01:23:30.440
Good.

1727
01:23:33.921 --> 01:23:36.837
The second letter
is from Milly Dale.

1728
01:23:36.968 --> 01:23:39.449
your grandmother.
to my grandfather.

1729
01:23:49.415 --> 01:23:51.548
That's my Grandma Milly.

1730
01:23:51.678 --> 01:23:52.853
And that's my Grandpa Robert.

1731
01:24:02.820 --> 01:24:04.039
Emily.

1732
01:24:04.169 --> 01:24:06.954
Milly is short for Emily.

1733
01:24:07.085 --> 01:24:09.609
Your grandfather named his
boat after my grandmother.

1734
01:24:11.481 --> 01:24:13.048
That's so romantic.

1735
01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:21.143
And now the best for last.

1736
01:24:23.188 --> 01:24:27.975
Okay.

1737
01:24:29.368 --> 01:24:30.587
My beloved Milly

1738
01:24:30.717 --> 01:24:32.110
would not accept my
proposal of marriage.

1739
01:24:32.241 --> 01:24:36.549
But we remained loving
friends our whole lives.

1740
01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:38.943
As a token of that love.
I leave her granddaughter.

1741
01:24:39.074 --> 01:24:41.859
Samantha Hill. the property

1742
01:24:41.989 --> 01:24:45.428
where Hill and Dale's
Found Books & Shop stands.

1743
01:24:46.907 --> 01:24:49.475
And the enclosed as
a lasting memento

1744
01:24:49.606 --> 01:24:52.261
of a love that might have been.

1745
01:24:52.391 --> 01:24:53.566
Robert MacGraw.

1746
01:24:57.744 --> 01:24:59.355
The bookshop is yours.

1747
01:25:01.357 --> 01:25:02.619
I can't believe this.

1748
01:25:02.749 --> 01:25:04.403
Sam. you deserve it.

1749
01:25:09.452 --> 01:25:11.106
What did that last line mean?

1750
01:25:13.238 --> 01:25:16.154
That's a surprise.

1751
01:25:35.347 --> 01:25:37.349
That is all we've got left.

1752
01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:39.090
Hi.

1753
01:25:39.221 --> 01:25:40.047
Help yourself.

1754
01:25:42.224 --> 01:25:43.399
Okay. sure.

1755
01:25:43.529 --> 01:25:44.574
You're really good
at this warrior thing.

1756
01:25:44.704 --> 01:25:46.053
Viking.

1757
01:25:46.184 --> 01:25:48.099
Whatever.
Pump those pecs.

1758
01:25:52.059 --> 01:25:53.017
He's amazing.

1759
01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:55.585
I was wrong.

1760
01:25:55.715 --> 01:25:56.586
Very wrong.

1761
01:25:58.588 --> 01:26:00.459
Whatever he's got.
we need to bottle it.

1762
01:26:00.590 --> 01:26:01.808
Oh. I'm trying.

1763
01:26:03.070 --> 01:26:04.594
Get in it here.
I want a picture.

1764
01:26:04.724 --> 01:26:05.595
Okay.

1765
01:26:07.727 --> 01:26:09.947
How's my big.
bad Viking doing?

1766
01:26:10.077 --> 01:26:12.515
Just another day of
pillaging and plundering.

1767
01:26:12.645 --> 01:26:14.430
It's for a good cause.

1768
01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:18.521
Yeah. but if one more little
old lady pinches my butt.

1769
01:26:18.651 --> 01:26:20.349
- Oh my.
- I know.

1770
01:26:20.479 --> 01:26:22.438
Not as innocent as they look.

1771
01:26:23.917 --> 01:26:26.268
So what do you think?

1772
01:26:26.398 --> 01:26:27.660
I like it.

1773
01:26:27.791 --> 01:26:28.748
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1774
01:26:28.879 --> 01:26:30.228
But I prefer the real you.

1775
01:26:32.665 --> 01:26:34.406
Good.

1776
01:26:34.537 --> 01:26:35.755
Smile. you two!

1777
01:26:41.674 --> 01:26:44.721
Okay. I'm gonna let you get
back to your Viking duties.

1778
01:26:44.851 --> 01:26:46.940
Right. And I'll see you later?

1779
01:26:47.071 --> 01:26:47.941
Absolutely.

1780
01:26:49.291 --> 01:26:50.770
Okay. go.

1781
01:27:07.309 --> 01:27:08.919
Such a beautiful night.

1782
01:27:11.487 --> 01:27:13.097
Oh. I almost forgot.

1783
01:27:21.627 --> 01:27:23.281
Are you proposing?

1784
01:27:23.412 --> 01:27:25.065
It's a bit early for
that. don't you think?

1785
01:27:25.196 --> 01:27:26.589
I'm just showing it to you.

1786
01:27:28.982 --> 01:27:30.245
This is the engagement ring

1787
01:27:30.375 --> 01:27:31.811
that my grandfather
gave to Milly.

1788
01:27:31.942 --> 01:27:34.423
It was in the letter
about the bookshop.

1789
01:27:39.166 --> 01:27:41.560
"And the enclosed
as a lasting memento

1790
01:27:41.691 --> 01:27:42.953
of a love that might have been."

1791
01:27:45.912 --> 01:27:46.783
This is a lot to take in.

1792
01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:55.487
Don't worry.

1793
01:27:57.402 --> 01:27:59.578
We have all the
time in the world.

1794
01:28:32.045 --> 01:28:34.874
♪ Maybe you think
