3
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.200
I am Kattunayakan.

4
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.240
Kattunayakan means "Kings of the forest."

5
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.080
This is my home. where I belong.
where the wild animals roam free.

6
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:56.120
This is also the land
where my ancestors lived for generations.

7
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.600
Oh. my dear. Did you sleep. my child?

8
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.360
How are you?

9
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.120
Come. come here.

10
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.120
Come closer.

11
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.920
Come here. my dear.

12
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.320
Come. come here. Come closer.

13
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.920
Oh. my dear.

14
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.320
Raghu! My baby.

15
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.720
Come.

16
00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.240
Hey. come.

17
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.080
Hey. lie down here.

18
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.960
Bomman. Bomman!

19
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.400
I am trying to light the fire!

20
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.680
I am not going to marry someone
who's going to be covered with ash.

21
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.000
When I arrived.
the baby elephant was in a very bad state.

22
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.720
He was in a lot of pain. his tail had been
bitten off by stray dogs

23
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.120
and his open wounds
were infested with maggots.

24
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.360
Raghu's mother got electrocuted
and died instantly.

25
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.320
Due to a prolonged drought.

26
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.320
his herd had wandered into a village
in search of food and water.

27
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.720
They tried to reunite Raghu with his herd.
but they were not successful.

28
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.760
Before this baby elephant.
I wasn't officially a caretaker.

29
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.480
When I first met the baby.

30
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.600
he was tugging at my clothes like a child.
and I felt his love.

31
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.920
I decided I would give
this motherless baby a chance.

32
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.080
I am very happy
that the Forest Department assigned Bellie

33
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.520
to work with me to care for Raghu.

34
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.640
She is the only woman currently assigned

35
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.880
to care for baby elephants in Tamil Nadu.

36
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.200
Look over there
beneath the tree. there it is.

37
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.880
There is one more walking down there.

38
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.560
When Raghu arrived here.
he was in bad shape.

39
00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.800
Everyone thought he wouldn't survive.

40
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.440
but that is what
gave me faith that he would.

41
00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.840
No one knew if Raghu would even survive.

42
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.360
He was in such a bad state.

43
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.400
It was a long
and difficult process to cure Raghu.

44
00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.400
But now it feels great to see him healthy.

45
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.000
We've been looking after our baby Raghu
for almost three years now.

46
00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.040
This place is an elephant
rehabilitation camp.

47
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.120
Orphaned. abandoned and displaced
wild elephants are brought here.

48
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.400
And we take care of them.

49
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.160
My grandfather looked after elephants.
my father looked after elephants.

50
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.800
and I became an elephant caregiver
the day my father died.

51
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.120
Raghu! I've been looking for your bell.
How did you lose it?

52
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.600
You dropped it in the water?

53
00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.040
Luckily. I found it in the river!

54
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.480
Don't lose it again!

55
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.560
They wear a bell

56
00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.800
so we can hear them
if they get lost in the forest

57
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.800
because we would lose them and they
will not be able to fend for themselves.

58
00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.040
Raghu has a friend called Krishna.

59
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.080
Look. Raghu is going over to Krishna!

60
00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:35.120
Raghu can't pluck grass on his own.
and is learning from Krishna.

61
00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.880
Raghu got a thorn stuck on his tongue.
and Krishna took it out.

62
00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.000
Elephants are meant to be wild.

63
00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.160
Watching him with Krishna
brings us much happiness.

64
00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.760
There is only so much we can teach them.

65
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.280
and there are things they can only learn
from one of their own kind.

66
00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.000
Are you eating soap?
Haven't you tasted soap before?

67
00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.480
Hey! You are putting water on me.
Don't splash like that!

68
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.440
Oh. my dear.

69
00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:43.640
Who is it?

70
00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.800
What do you want?

71
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.560
Oh. my dear child.

72
00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.400
Who is the best elephant? Is it you?

73
00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:02.240
Oh. whose darling is this? Who is this?

74
00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.920
We have become a family around Raghu
and we think that's why he survived.

75
00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.800
While bringing up Raghu.
we forget about all our other worries.

76
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.920
I have experienced many losses in my life.

77
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.760
My ex-husband was killed by a tiger.

78
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.960
This left me
feeling scared of the forests.

79
00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.280
I get scared when I see a tiger.

80
00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:54.240
I am a tribal woman. and our people
come from the heart of the forest.

81
00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.000
For us Kattunayakans. the well-being
of the forest is all that matters.

82
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.440
We walk barefoot within it.

83
00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.960
This is our way of showing respect.

84
00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:17.040
We're going to climb down that rock there…

85
00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.840
We live off the forest.
but we also protect it.

86
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.280
We only take what we need.

87
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.280
Our people do not fear elephants.

88
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.520
that's why we've been
working with them for generations.

89
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.440
I have learned over the many years
of working with elephants

90
00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.080
that they are very intelligent
and emotional beings.

91
00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.520
But working with elephants
is dangerous in so many ways.

92
00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.800
I got stabbed
by my big tusker a while ago.

93
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.480
I cannot work
with large elephants anymore.

94
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.480
There it is. Open it!

95
00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.720
That is why I feel getting Raghu

96
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:49.600
was a gift from God.

97
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.200
I want to do my best for him.

98
00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.440
I feel like I am his mother.

99
00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.120
Drink from here…

100
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.360
Everything about him is like a human.

101
00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.400
except that he cannot talk.
He does everything else.

102
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.920
Recently. my daughter died.

103
00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.120
Losing a child… the pain is incomparable.

104
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.800
When I cried.
Raghu wiped my tears away with his trunk.

105
00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.040
And this small gesture comforted me.

106
00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.240
I feel he really understands everything.

107
00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.840
I remember what my daughter
was like at Raghu's age.

108
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.880
Taking care of Raghu reminds me of taking
care of my own daughter in so many ways.

109
00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.520
It's like she has come back into my life.

110
00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.880
Look how naughty you are today.

111
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.480
See how naughty you are.

112
00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.360
Bring all the sugarcane here.

113
00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.880
I don't think he wants
the millet ball today.

114
00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.720
But we have to first give him the millet.

115
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.120
If you give it to him like that.
he will eat it.

116
00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:57.240
He has his eyes
on that dried coconut and jaggery.

117
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.960
I really don't like your habit
of putting your hand in the bucket!

118
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:17.080
He's not going to eat any more
because he's only looking at that coconut.

119
00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.720
This is what he was like
when he was young.

120
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.240
both of us had to take turns to feed him.
only then he'd eat.

121
00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:33.400
Come here. try to feed him.
he isn't eating.

122
00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.120
Aye. why aren't you eating. naughty boy?

123
00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.600
Why didn't you eat properly
when she was feeding you?

124
00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.200
The rains have come.
This will make the grass grow for you.

125
00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.480
Raghu will get so much grass to eat.

126
00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.280
Come.

127
00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.240
Raghu. come here under the umbrella.

128
00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:07.080
Tomorrow when I receive my salary.
I'll go buy some fruits.

129
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.760
You feed me and I'll feed you.

130
00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.200
What if while I am feeding you.
you bite my fingers?

131
00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.760
Don't talk like that.

132
00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.720
Raghu. my child.

133
00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:25.240
Wait. I will give you some. I am coming.

134
00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:26.200
I am so full.

135
00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.440
Let's light the fire
and bring the water to boil.

136
00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.920
He is sleepy.

137
00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.280
Wait. it is almost ready!

138
00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:00.720
Don't try to pull the tube. it will break.

139
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:03.960
Are you sleepy?

140
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.680
Stand still!
Are you trying to eat the garland?

141
00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.040
Stop eating all the flowers!

142
00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.720
Let go of them!

143
00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:56.920
On a special ceremony day.

144
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.400
elephant calves are taken
to seek their blessings

145
00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.000
from Lord Ganesha.

146
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.320
I am proud of being
both a priest and a mahout.

147
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.080
both bring me immense happiness.

148
00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.680
We pray to Lord Ganesha.

149
00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:26.040
Seeing an elephant. to us.
is equivalent to seeing God.

150
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.920
God and elephants are one for me.

151
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.120
The way I serve God
is the same way I serve the elephants.

152
00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.480
We take care of Raghu every single day.

153
00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:42.120
which in turn puts food
on my table every day.

154
00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.080
This is God's presence in my life.

155
00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.720
Without him. we'd have nothing.

156
00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.320
Early morning. 5am. Bomman got a call.

157
00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.560
The Forest Department asked me
to come to the camp immediately.

158
00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:22.240
When I went to see it.
it was a tiny thing with a snotty trunk.

159
00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:49.120
The camp managers said
we have to take charge of baby Ammu.

160
00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.800
They said.
despite everyone else's efforts.

161
00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.560
all the other elephant babies died.

162
00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.480
"You successfully managed to raise Raghu."

163
00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:14.800
For a whole week. Raghu was very upset.

164
00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:31.400
If Ammu was standing close to us.
he would come and push her away

165
00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.320
so that he could stand beside us.

166
00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:38.640
Slowly. he got used to Ammu's presence.

167
00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.200
Hey. wait.

168
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.320
Now. we are all a family.

169
00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:24.520
By working together with Bomman.

170
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.040
the bond between us has grown so much.

171
00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:03.360
Look at all of you dancing without me.
Here I come.

172
00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:43.960
Come! My dear ones. run and come!

173
00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:50.440
Run a little faster to me. Come!

174
00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:16.440
Hey. stop eating the flowers!

175
00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.360
Sanjana is my granddaughter.

176
00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.360
Ama. I'll wear that dress!

177
00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:22.320
She loves me so much
and helps me in everything.

178
00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:26.600
Sanjana has always
loved elephants very much.

179
00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.960
Even now. as she is growing up.
she loves them.

180
00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:33.600
I take Sanjana along with me
to help take care of the elephants.

181
00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:36.000
I want her to learn from me.

182
00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.280
We are their parents.

183
00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:45.480
We do whatever it takes
to provide for them in all their needs.

184
00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.760
Looking after two elephants
means giving them milk.

185
00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.040
cleaning out their room. bathing them…

186
00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.840
Alongside all the hard work and care.

187
00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:44.320
elephants also require a lot
of love and affection.

188
00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:48.760
It's just like raising human babies.

189
00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.160
-Hey.
-Take it.

190
00:28:55.440 --> 00:29:01.680
The cup is empty now!

191
00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.400
Water.

192
00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:19.400
Sanjana. let me tell you a story.

193
00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:25.120
Three blind men went to the jungle
and they came across an elephant.

194
00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:31.680
One of them touched the trunk
and said it felt like a serpent.

195
00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:35.560
Another touched the ear
and said. "It's a sieve!"

196
00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:42.040
The third touched the tail
and said. "It's a broom!"

197
00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.000
In the same way.

198
00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:51.040
many believe that elephants
are dangerous and they raid crops.

199
00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:55.040
But only people
who live close to elephants

200
00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.760
know about elephants.

201
00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:02.880
That they show love when you show love.

202
00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.960
Just like Ammu and Raghu.

203
00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:30.880
Shortly after our wedding.
we got a call from the Forest Department.

204
00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:35.960
telling us Raghu would be assigned
to another caregiver.

205
00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:09.240
We begged the forest rangers
not to take Raghu away from us.

206
00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:22.080
Raghu hesitated a lot
while being taken away.

207
00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:25.040
He kept turning around.
looking back at us and Ammu.

208
00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.400
and walked very slowly.

209
00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:33.680
Then Ammu cried out to him
and he came running back to touch her

210
00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.400
and they came back to take him away again.

211
00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:52.840
My wife and I couldn't even
eat properly for a few days.

212
00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:55.680
We had put in everything
into raising Raghu.

213
00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:58.000
We've been through so much.

214
00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.480
There wasn't a single God left
who we didn't pray to.

215
00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:04.080
After all the difficulties we faced
in raising Raghu.

216
00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:06.480
it brings tears to my eyes.

217
00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:13.920
No.

218
00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:28.680
I feel the same intense pain I felt
when my daughter died.

219
00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:32.600
I took as much care of him
as if he had been my own child

220
00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.720
because I had to ensure his survival.

221
00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.360
We love them so much.

222
00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:45.800
We have brought them up

223
00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:50.560
as our own children.

224
00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:58.840
It was so painful for us and also Ammu.

225
00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:02.200
Ammu was very upset and didn't even
drink her milk for a few days.

226
00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.400
because she was separated from Raghu.

227
00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:22.160
What are you searching for?

228
00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:23.640
I don't have any.

229
00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:26.760
Lie down here.

230
00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.480
If you lie on me
then you will get a spanking.

231
00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:31.680
Lie down here.

232
00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:01.320
Ammu. Do you want your milk?

233
00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:03.480
What?

234
00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:05.920
Do you want milk?

235
00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:11.360
Leave me. let me go and prepare milk.

236
00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:47.600
From being scared of the forest.

237
00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:49.719
now I'm not.

238
00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:58.080
I had so much loss and sadness.

239
00:34:58.159 --> 00:35:01.159
but now I've found my way through it.
I've found my voice.

240
00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.880
I have raised two baby elephants.

241
00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:21.040
Now everyone knows me
as the mother of elephants

242
00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.840
and that makes me very proud.

243
00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:37.840
It is the actions of us humans

244
00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:40.320
that is causing elephants
to enter villages these days.

245
00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:45.800
Our mistakes are very harmful.
both for us and for elephants.

246
00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:53.360
We were able to save Raghu and Ammu
because they were brought to us.

247
00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:58.880
Baby Ammu!

248
00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:03.880
But we are not able to save all of them.

249
00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:19.760
Every time I see Raghu. I feel great joy.

250
00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:23.120
Even today he still comes
running to me when I call.

251
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.360
Aye. here. come to me. come!

252
00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:38.920
I see the love he has for me.
and I feel love for him too.

253
00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.960
This is me when I was a young boy.

254
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.400
These children are our future.

255
00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:21.360
We want the younger generation
to learn from us.

256
00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:24.320
They learn by watching
and helping us work.

257
00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:29.960
After me. this younger generation
will carry on the tradition

258
00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:32.200
of working with elephants
and they will do it well.

259
00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.320
I cannot imagine a life without elephants.
