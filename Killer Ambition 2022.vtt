3
00:00:19.228 --> 00:00:21.103
I bet I'd make it
to the water first.

4
00:00:21.188 --> 00:00:22.938
As long as your clothes
are off before you do.

5
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.777
This way.

6
00:00:31.407 --> 00:00:32.531
Come on.

7
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.821
Let's go this way.

8
00:00:39.915 --> 00:00:42.207
-Here.
-My turn.

9
00:00:49.425 --> 00:00:52.426
-Oh. my God.

10
00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:55.596
-Ma'am? Ma'am? Ma'am?
-Oh. my gosh.

11
00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:59.224
-Oh. my gosh.
-Oh. my God.

12
00:01:23.793 --> 00:01:25.167
-Corey.
-Wow.

13
00:01:25.252 --> 00:01:27.035
Sylvia. that is gorgeous.

14
00:01:27.129 --> 00:01:29.254
Is that part
of Lush Designs' new line?

15
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.540
Luke is upgrading
Claire's engagement ring

16
00:01:31.634 --> 00:01:33.509
for their tenth anniversary.

17
00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:36.044
This'll be one of a kind.

18
00:01:36.138 --> 00:01:38.713
Her original ring
was my first commission.

19
00:01:38.808 --> 00:01:40.390
That's where I got my start.

20
00:01:40.518 --> 00:01:42.384
From there.
it was word of mouth.

21
00:01:42.478 --> 00:01:45.220
And now your designs are sold
nationwide.

22
00:01:45.314 --> 00:01:48.232
Some days it still feels unreal.

23
00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:50.392
Well...

24
00:01:50.486 --> 00:01:52.361
It's getting late.

25
00:01:52.446 --> 00:01:53.737
Aren't you and Bruce
going to a concert?

26
00:01:53.864 --> 00:01:55.572
Oh. yeah. I've really gotta go.

27
00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:57.741
-Um. you okay to lock up?
-Yeah.

28
00:01:57.868 --> 00:02:00.077
-Are you sure?
-Yes. yes. Go. Have fun.

29
00:02:00.204 --> 00:02:02.079
-Ooh! Sorry.
-Oh! No. Uh...

30
00:02:02.206 --> 00:02:04.739
Excuse me. I should have been
watching where I was going.

31
00:02:04.834 --> 00:02:07.000
Jesse!
I wasn't expecting you today.

32
00:02:07.086 --> 00:02:08.877
Are you here
for the design specifications?

33
00:02:08.963 --> 00:02:11.004
Well. yeah. I wanted to make
sure that the gemstones

34
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.298
we're sourcing you
are exactly what you need.

35
00:02:13.384 --> 00:02:15.750
-Mm.
-Mm.

36
00:02:15.845 --> 00:02:17.719
Corey. is there something else?

37
00:02:17.805 --> 00:02:19.555
Mn-mn.

38
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.848
Oh.

39
00:02:24.854 --> 00:02:26.645
Do you have that effect
on everyone?

40
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.313
That effect?

41
00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:29.690
That's an occupational hazard

42
00:02:29.775 --> 00:02:31.441
for being a diamond broker.

43
00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.436
Everyone loves diamonds.

44
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.240
-Hm. I don't think that's it.
-Mm.

45
00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:41.109
I've seen more than one person
try and hit on you.

46
00:02:41.203 --> 00:02:42.578
Oh. really?

47
00:02:50.421 --> 00:02:52.171
Are you jealous?

48
00:02:52.256 --> 00:02:54.423
I don't do jealous.

49
00:02:54.508 --> 00:02:55.841
Why are you here?

50
00:02:58.262 --> 00:03:00.721
Well. officially.
to get the specs...

51
00:03:00.806 --> 00:03:03.182
-Mm-hmm.
-Unofficially...

52
00:03:05.603 --> 00:03:07.969
-We agreed to be discreet.
-Everyone's gone home.

53
00:03:08.063 --> 00:03:10.639
It doesn't get more discreet.

54
00:03:10.733 --> 00:03:12.399
What about security?

55
00:03:12.484 --> 00:03:15.477
Because of the design leaks.
we've added more cameras.

56
00:03:15.571 --> 00:03:18.197
You put security cameras
in your office?

57
00:03:19.783 --> 00:03:21.408
Not in my office.

58
00:03:32.713 --> 00:03:34.171
Kat.

59
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.667
There's something
I need you to do for me.

60
00:03:38.761 --> 00:03:43.138
Ooh. that's Sylvia Stafford
from Lush Designs.

61
00:03:43.224 --> 00:03:46.841
Make sure she's there.
We need her in our little group.

62
00:03:46.936 --> 00:03:50.771
Well. there-there isn't much
time. I don't know if I could...

63
00:03:50.856 --> 00:03:52.773
Russo.

64
00:03:52.858 --> 00:03:56.017
Help Kat get Ms. Stafford
to our next meeting.

65
00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:57.527
Certainly.

66
00:03:57.655 --> 00:04:00.656
-It's settled.
-Yeah. Okay.

67
00:04:12.127 --> 00:04:14.869
-Hi. Sylvia!
-Claire. Uh...

68
00:04:14.964 --> 00:04:16.204
I was afraid
you were gonna cancel.

69
00:04:16.298 --> 00:04:19.299
Oh. I was. too.
Nathan is teething.

70
00:04:19.385 --> 00:04:21.042
And I could barely get dressed
by the time the nanny

71
00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:23.553
got there. It was crazy.
What are you working on?

72
00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:25.138
It's just a new design for Lush.

73
00:04:25.224 --> 00:04:28.141
-Let me see.
-It's really rough.

74
00:04:29.311 --> 00:04:31.395
Oh. my gosh. what is that?

75
00:04:31.522 --> 00:04:35.056
-What? Oh. Claire! Claire. no.
-So easy!

76
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.226
These are the kids' birthstones.
Is this for me?

77
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.397
Luke asked me to design you
a more lavish engagement ring.

78
00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:45.734
Syl. this is beautiful.
I love it!

79
00:04:45.828 --> 00:04:48.403
But I am mad at you
for ruining the surprise.

80
00:04:48.497 --> 00:04:50.622
You-your-your article comes out
in the newspaper tomorrow.

81
00:04:50.708 --> 00:04:52.541
-Are you nervous?
-A little.

82
00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:55.210
They asked me so many questions.
I can hardly remember them all.

83
00:04:55.296 --> 00:04:56.578
But I think it'll be good.

84
00:04:56.672 --> 00:04:58.246
Did they ask
about your love life?

85
00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.132
No. it's for
the business section.

86
00:05:00.217 --> 00:05:01.508
so we talked business.

87
00:05:01.593 --> 00:05:02.917
Boring.

88
00:05:03.012 --> 00:05:04.252
Okay. well. then I will ask

89
00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:06.087
because Luke
has this friend Noah.

90
00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:07.922
-He is perfect--
-I'm seeing someone.

91
00:05:08.017 --> 00:05:10.592
You are? That's great!
When do I get to meet him?

92
00:05:10.686 --> 00:05:13.020
Are you excited
about your anniversary trip?

93
00:05:13.105 --> 00:05:14.929
Yeah. but you're not gonna dodge
my question.

94
00:05:15.024 --> 00:05:17.274
-I wanna know about this guy.
-There's nothing to tell.

95
00:05:17.401 --> 00:05:18.608
It's still really early.
and we're trying

96
00:05:18.736 --> 00:05:20.736
to keep a low profile.

97
00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:22.362
-What's with the look?
-Nothing.

98
00:05:22.448 --> 00:05:25.440
I just hope that you're gonna
find the right guy.

99
00:05:25.534 --> 00:05:27.034
I mean. for someone
who designs wedding rings.

100
00:05:27.119 --> 00:05:29.077
you seem kind of opposed
to marriage.

101
00:05:29.163 --> 00:05:31.446
I'm not opposed to marriage.
just not sure

102
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.582
I'll ever find
what you and Luke have.

103
00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:38.128
My mom. uh. was beautiful.
talented. funny.

104
00:05:38.255 --> 00:05:41.048
And she ended up
in a miserable marriage.

105
00:05:41.133 --> 00:05:44.125
Well. you're not your mom.

106
00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:46.127
and it's gonna happen for you
at the right time

107
00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:47.763
and it's gonna be great.

108
00:05:47.848 --> 00:05:50.390
-You're the best.
-I know.

109
00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:47.280
Well. you moved on quickly.

110
00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:53.995
I don't see
how that's any of your business.

111
00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:55.864
You're right. it's not.

112
00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.199
So what am I doing here. Becca?

113
00:06:58.293 --> 00:07:00.210
To tell me how you plan
to pay me back

114
00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:02.337
for what you cost my business.

115
00:07:02.423 --> 00:07:04.756
I don't owe you anything.

116
00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:09.803
Other people may be willing
to let you off the hook.

117
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.180
I'm not.

118
00:07:14.643 --> 00:07:19.271
I had some friends
do some digging. and. oh.

119
00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:23.224
they found some very interesting
business ventures

120
00:07:23.318 --> 00:07:25.610
you're involved in.

121
00:07:25.696 --> 00:07:28.405
I don't know
what you're talking about.

122
00:07:28.532 --> 00:07:30.407
Stop wasting my time.

123
00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:37.080
-I'll be in touch. Jesse.
-Can't wait.

124
00:08:00.481 --> 00:08:01.688
Hello?

125
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.360
Hello?

126
00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:28.632
Oh. thank you! You didn't have
to get me a coffee.

127
00:08:28.759 --> 00:08:29.925
Mm.

128
00:08:30.928 --> 00:08:32.794
Do I look that bad?

129
00:08:32.888 --> 00:08:35.180
Hm. not at all. I was already
getting one for myself.

130
00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:36.723
You're a terrible liar.

131
00:08:40.145 --> 00:08:42.646
I hardly slept last night.

132
00:08:42.773 --> 00:08:45.732
I kept getting anonymous calls
with no one there.

133
00:08:45.817 --> 00:08:47.817
-Did you block the number?
-Yeah.

134
00:08:47.945 --> 00:08:50.278
And then it'd happen again
with a different number.

135
00:08:50.364 --> 00:08:53.448
Yeah. well.
you really do need to be careful

136
00:08:53.534 --> 00:08:56.317
now that
you're in the public eye.

137
00:08:56.411 --> 00:09:00.154
I finally just shut off my phone
so I could get some sleep.

138
00:09:00.249 --> 00:09:02.323
Oh. my gosh. Corey.

139
00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:04.251
Sorry. uh.
I was just playing around.

140
00:09:04.336 --> 00:09:06.378
-Here. I'll put it back.
-No. no. no. no. I...

141
00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:09.631
I like it. You have a real eye.

142
00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:11.165
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

143
00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.343
Oh! I almost forgot.

144
00:09:14.388 --> 00:09:16.004
Special delivery.

145
00:09:16.098 --> 00:09:18.139
Mm? Mm.

146
00:09:25.983 --> 00:09:29.234
I've got invited to join the
Females In Leadership society.

147
00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:31.653
I can't believe it.

148
00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:33.697
I can't believe it either.

149
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:37.242
-Hm.
-Hm.

150
00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:45.033
-Mm-hmm.
-Have you read the article?

151
00:09:45.127 --> 00:09:47.294
I was too afraid
to even buy a copy.

152
00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:51.089
Uh. I figured that.

153
00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:54.426
But I will say...

154
00:09:57.014 --> 00:10:00.348
this is a lovely spread
in the society section.

155
00:10:00.434 --> 00:10:01.683
What?

156
00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:03.727
Uh...

157
00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:10.525
"Every woman should sparkle
like a star." I never said that.

158
00:10:10.611 --> 00:10:13.320
T-this-this was supposed to be
a business article.

159
00:10:13.405 --> 00:10:15.697
Yeah. but the society section
makes sense.

160
00:10:15.782 --> 00:10:18.116
When people think Lush Designs.
they think glamor.

161
00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:20.368
And almost every celebrity
wears your jewelry.

162
00:10:22.331 --> 00:10:24.238
"She overcame
a series of personal tragedies

163
00:10:24.333 --> 00:10:26.574
at an early age."

164
00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:28.409
Listen. I don't know what
the problem is. I'd love to have

165
00:10:28.503 --> 00:10:29.878
this kind of publicity
for my business.

166
00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:32.246
I built Lush Designs
from the ground up.

167
00:10:32.341 --> 00:10:34.248
I thought I was being recognized
for that.

168
00:10:34.343 --> 00:10:36.134
Well. I understand that.
but the part

169
00:10:36.219 --> 00:10:38.762
w-where you're being honest
about your father...

170
00:10:38.889 --> 00:10:40.055
Okay. that was off the record.

171
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.257
Well. apparently. it was
on the record. It's right there.

172
00:10:43.352 --> 00:10:46.561
"Speaking
of her estranged father.

173
00:10:46.647 --> 00:10:49.981
Sylvia admitted a part of her
will always miss him."

174
00:10:56.698 --> 00:10:59.273
-What are you doing?
-I'm calling that reporter.

175
00:10:59.368 --> 00:11:00.775
-I'm not gonna let this go.

176
00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:02.944
No. no. we are not.

177
00:11:03.038 --> 00:11:04.278
-Come on.
-Why?

178
00:11:04.373 --> 00:11:06.614
-Give me the phone.
-Why?

179
00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:09.834
-Give me the phone.

180
00:11:11.755 --> 00:11:14.964
You're not gonna
call them tonight.

181
00:11:15.092 --> 00:11:17.008
You can call them tomorrow.

182
00:11:17.094 --> 00:11:19.719
Why? Because I need time
to decide or...

183
00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:23.431
Definitely or.

184
00:11:32.943 --> 00:11:34.475
This is nice.

185
00:11:34.569 --> 00:11:35.735
Mm-hmm.

186
00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:40.982
Hey. I'm really sorry
that the article

187
00:11:41.076 --> 00:11:42.701
wasn't what you were expecting.

188
00:11:46.665 --> 00:11:48.039
Well. maybe you're right.

189
00:11:49.793 --> 00:11:52.043
I should just enjoy
the publicity.

190
00:11:57.592 --> 00:12:00.760
Hey. I'm just curious. When was
the last time you saw your dad?

191
00:12:02.264 --> 00:12:04.681
Hm. When I was 18.

192
00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:09.811
The last time I saw him. he was
kicking me out of his house.

193
00:12:12.733 --> 00:12:14.524
Wow.

194
00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:16.651
And how can you still have
feelings for him

195
00:12:16.737 --> 00:12:18.853
after something like that?

196
00:12:18.947 --> 00:12:19.946
Well...

197
00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.578
I remember what he was like
when I was little.

198
00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:32.200
I thought I had the best dad
in the world.

199
00:12:32.294 --> 00:12:34.294
I was a total daddy's girl.

200
00:12:36.006 --> 00:12:39.632
My mom and I just adored him.

201
00:12:39.718 --> 00:12:44.179
That's the dad I miss.
not the bitter person he became

202
00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:46.014
when he started drinking.

203
00:12:50.103 --> 00:12:51.102
Hey.

204
00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:55.565
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to get too personal.

205
00:12:57.486 --> 00:13:00.320
I guess it's impossible to
always keep things casual. huh?

206
00:13:00.405 --> 00:13:01.488
Hm.

207
00:13:02.866 --> 00:13:03.907
God.

208
00:13:10.332 --> 00:13:12.907
Look what I got today.

209
00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:16.753
What's this?
"Females In Leadership."

210
00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.548
It's a group
of highly successful women.

211
00:13:20.634 --> 00:13:25.345
Ah. yeah. or a group that preys
on highly successful women.

212
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:27.430
Seriously.
I hear people join these

213
00:13:27.557 --> 00:13:29.682
just to troll the competition.

214
00:13:29.768 --> 00:13:33.228
-FIL has a very good reputation.
-Yeah. the powerful often do.

215
00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:35.230
-All right. don't join.

216
00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:37.982
It's almost 12:00.
and that's the deadline anyway.

217
00:13:39.486 --> 00:13:42.987
How about
let's go for round two?

218
00:13:44.616 --> 00:13:46.616
I still have time to finish.

219
00:14:38.003 --> 00:14:39.210
Hello?

220
00:14:42.757 --> 00:14:44.674
Whoever this is.
stop calling me.

221
00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:47.168
Sylvia. this is Kat from FIL.

222
00:14:47.262 --> 00:14:49.337
The FIL? What-what time is it?

223
00:14:49.431 --> 00:14:52.173
There's a meeting today.
You're expected to attend.

224
00:14:52.267 --> 00:14:54.008
-I'll send details later.
-Today? I don't know if--

225
00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:56.769
Look. if you wanna join.
you'll be there.

226
00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:18.458
Corey.

227
00:15:18.543 --> 00:15:20.209
I didn't know you designed.

228
00:15:20.337 --> 00:15:24.005
I doodle a little.

229
00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:28.134
This is more than doodling.
You have real talent.

230
00:15:28.219 --> 00:15:31.054
-You think?
-Definitely.

231
00:15:31.181 --> 00:15:32.931
-May I?
-Yeah.

232
00:15:41.858 --> 00:15:44.359
I'd love to see
more of your designs.

233
00:15:44.444 --> 00:15:46.694
Yeah. of course.

234
00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.280
-Yeah.

235
00:15:49.366 --> 00:15:52.200
I'll be out the rest of the day.
but call me if you need me.

236
00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:54.402
-Yeah. I've got things here.

237
00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:57.238
Sylvia. Oh. my...

238
00:15:57.332 --> 00:15:58.665
Dad...

239
00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:01.575
Earl.

240
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.295
It's. um. it's been a long time.

241
00:16:06.675 --> 00:16:08.082
-You saw the article.
-Heck. yeah.

242
00:16:08.176 --> 00:16:11.970
-I'm proud of my baby girl.
-Why are you here?

243
00:16:12.055 --> 00:16:14.088
Well. I just.
I thought maybe--

244
00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:15.390
Well. you just thought
that maybe we could be

245
00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:17.016
a family again?

246
00:16:18.853 --> 00:16:20.395
Did you come here
because of what they quoted me

247
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.431
saying about you?

248
00:16:23.525 --> 00:16:26.267
Did they misquote you
when you said you miss me?

249
00:16:26.361 --> 00:16:28.602
Look. I know I don't deserve
a second chance.

250
00:16:28.697 --> 00:16:30.405
I just wanted to talk.

251
00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.606
I'm busy. Earl.

252
00:16:32.701 --> 00:16:33.908
All right. please. don't.
don't go off like that.

253
00:16:33.994 --> 00:16:35.410
I'll do what I want. Look.

254
00:16:35.495 --> 00:16:38.279
I'm glad you've gotten
yourself together.

255
00:16:38.373 --> 00:16:39.747
but don't you show up here
expecting

256
00:16:39.833 --> 00:16:41.708
a pat on the back from me.

257
00:16:43.378 --> 00:16:47.130
I'm-I'm sorry. I-I guess
I expected too much too soon.

258
00:16:47.257 --> 00:16:50.717
You know. I read the article.
I just. I thought...

259
00:16:53.722 --> 00:16:56.464
I'm sorry. Sylvia.

260
00:16:56.558 --> 00:16:58.391
And I'm not.
I'm not gonna bother you again.

261
00:16:58.476 --> 00:16:59.767
Wait.

262
00:17:07.068 --> 00:17:09.477
Call my office and make an
appointment with my assistant.

263
00:17:09.571 --> 00:17:11.779
An appointment?

264
00:17:13.283 --> 00:17:14.907
Thank you. baby girl.

265
00:17:16.036 --> 00:17:17.535
You should go.

266
00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:20.288
You know. you. um.
you have your mother's smile.

267
00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:23.374
God. I loved her smile.

268
00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.501
Then why did you always
make her cry?

269
00:17:52.697 --> 00:17:54.188
-Do you mind coming with me?

270
00:17:54.282 --> 00:17:56.657
No! No! No!

271
00:17:56.743 --> 00:17:59.744
-Come on!

272
00:18:03.333 --> 00:18:05.833
Where are we?

273
00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:08.044
All your questions
will be answered shortly.

274
00:18:16.971 --> 00:18:19.847
Please allow me to apologize
again. Ms. Stafford.

275
00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:21.057
I thought I was gonna die!

276
00:18:21.184 --> 00:18:23.551
Oh. is there a problem?

277
00:18:23.645 --> 00:18:25.353
-Kidnapping?
-Oh.

278
00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:28.689
I apologize if our initiation
tactics made you uncomfortable.

279
00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:31.892
but our number-one rule at FIL
is secrecy.

280
00:18:31.986 --> 00:18:33.227
If that's so important. then why

281
00:18:33.321 --> 00:18:34.737
was the address
on the invitation?

282
00:18:34.864 --> 00:18:36.781
Oh. that's a fake.

283
00:18:36.866 --> 00:18:38.732
So secrecy. just not honesty.
Okay.

284
00:18:38.827 --> 00:18:42.161
On the contrary. we now keep
our society under lock and key

285
00:18:42.247 --> 00:18:45.248
after a potential member
released footage from a meeting.

286
00:18:45.375 --> 00:18:47.667
along with a few
of our cutting-edge ideas.

287
00:18:47.752 --> 00:18:50.837
It put the FIL
in a very vulnerable state.

288
00:18:52.048 --> 00:18:53.747
Well. no harm was done. though.

289
00:18:53.842 --> 00:18:56.843
-He scared me.
-Oh. Don't get me wrong.

290
00:18:56.928 --> 00:19:00.087
Russo has always scared me
a little.

291
00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:03.924
Uh. thank you. Russo. Buh-bye.

292
00:19:04.018 --> 00:19:05.184
Well. now that
that's all cleared up.

293
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:06.686
let me take you
to meet Elizabeth.

294
00:19:06.771 --> 00:19:08.596
-Elizabeth?
-Oh. the head of FIL.

295
00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:11.932
This is her home.
So put that away. Shall we?

296
00:19:12.026 --> 00:19:14.235
Elizabeth is impatient
to meet you.

297
00:19:22.287 --> 00:19:24.245
-Please.
-Oh. thank you.

298
00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:26.622
Thank you.

299
00:19:26.749 --> 00:19:29.617
So FIL board meetings
are anything but typical.

300
00:19:29.711 --> 00:19:33.171
We're dead serious when it comes
to business. though. so...

301
00:19:33.256 --> 00:19:34.622
Oh. here's Elizabeth now.

302
00:19:34.716 --> 00:19:36.957
-Welcome to my home.

303
00:19:37.051 --> 00:19:39.510
Elizabeth Collins. I'd like
to introduce Sylvia Stafford.

304
00:19:39.596 --> 00:19:41.721
I've been looking forward
to meeting you. Sylvia.

305
00:19:41.806 --> 00:19:44.473
Thank you. I was so thrilled
to be invited.

306
00:19:44.601 --> 00:19:47.134
It looks like we're
going to have to speak later.

307
00:19:47.228 --> 00:19:49.803
I have some business to attend
to if you'll excuse me.

308
00:19:49.898 --> 00:19:51.805
Will you introduce Sylvia
to the others?

309
00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.024
-Of course.
-Hm.

310
00:19:55.028 --> 00:19:57.737
Well. I guess I'll start
the introductions with myself.

311
00:19:57.822 --> 00:20:00.114
I'm sorry if we got off
on the wrong foot earlier.

312
00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.576
I'm Kat. Kat Cosmetics
is my beauty line.

313
00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:05.152
Maybe you've heard of it?

314
00:20:05.246 --> 00:20:07.371
Who hasn't?
I use all your stuff.

315
00:20:07.457 --> 00:20:09.490
Your eyeliners
are the absolute best.

316
00:20:09.584 --> 00:20:12.168
Really? Oh. Thank you.

317
00:20:12.295 --> 00:20:13.794
Maybe we can work out a deal.

318
00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.996
Some of your beauty
for some of my bling?

319
00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:19.166
Well. look at you.
I like the way you think.

320
00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:22.303
Oh. There's Vanessa.
You've got to meet her.

321
00:20:22.388 --> 00:20:23.671
And that's Becca.
in black.

322
00:20:23.765 --> 00:20:25.506
She has to be
the center of attention.

323
00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.308
In her mind. we're all
part of the Becca show.

324
00:20:27.393 --> 00:20:29.060
-Hi!
-Kat!

325
00:20:29.145 --> 00:20:32.513
Elizabeth said you were outside
greeting our newest member.

326
00:20:32.607 --> 00:20:35.066
Yes. that's right.
uh. Vanessa. Becca.

327
00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:37.235
I'd like to introduce
Sylvia Stafford.

328
00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.111
owner of Lush Designs.

329
00:20:39.197 --> 00:20:42.073
Becca owns
several fashion lines.

330
00:20:42.158 --> 00:20:44.325
A-are you Becca Brown?

331
00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:45.868
I am.

332
00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:47.861
Lush Designs often uses
your clothes in our ads.

333
00:20:47.956 --> 00:20:51.198
-They are so beautiful.
-Thank you.

334
00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:53.751
Uh. would you consider
a joint media campaign?

335
00:20:53.836 --> 00:20:56.462
I'd love for Lush Designs to
have your official endorsement.

336
00:20:56.547 --> 00:21:00.341
That's certainly
an interesting idea.

337
00:21:00.426 --> 00:21:01.717
I'll consider it.

338
00:21:01.844 --> 00:21:05.388
Oh! I love when pleasure
becomes business.

339
00:21:05.515 --> 00:21:08.099
And meet Vanessa.
creator of the hottest

340
00:21:08.184 --> 00:21:10.017
social-media app out there.
Ignite.

341
00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:12.311
Of course.
"Ignite your passion."

342
00:21:12.397 --> 00:21:14.388
When you join. we'll add you
to the FIL group.

343
00:21:14.482 --> 00:21:16.899
It's how we all keep in touch.

344
00:21:17.026 --> 00:21:21.445
Oh. maybe Vanessa has some ideas
for your proposed collaboration.

345
00:21:21.531 --> 00:21:26.492
Ah. Looks like we have
some catching up to do!

346
00:21:26.577 --> 00:21:28.536
-Are you and Thomas-- Ah!
-Engaged!

347
00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:32.373
Yes. I couldn't believe when he
surprised me with this sparkler.

348
00:21:32.458 --> 00:21:34.750
-Do you love it?
-Oh. of course.

349
00:21:34.877 --> 00:21:37.411
I'd recognize a Lush Design
anywhere.

350
00:21:37.505 --> 00:21:39.964
There's no mistaking your touch.
Sylvia...

351
00:21:40.967 --> 00:21:44.418
Wow. It looks so familiar.

352
00:21:44.512 --> 00:21:47.421
Uh. yeah. I mean. I-I love
your designs. Sylvia.

353
00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:49.923
but. uh. this is actually
by someone else.

354
00:21:50.018 --> 00:21:51.892
They're so new.
I don't even remember the name.

355
00:21:51.978 --> 00:21:55.688
Yeah. Well. if you'll excuse me.
I will be right back.

356
00:21:55.773 --> 00:21:57.264
Yes.

357
00:21:59.861 --> 00:22:01.819
Well. that went well.
What do we think?

358
00:22:01.904 --> 00:22:03.612
She needs to go through
the process. of course.

359
00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:04.864
Well. obviously.

360
00:22:11.372 --> 00:22:13.947
Hi. Jesse.

361
00:22:14.042 --> 00:22:16.950
Well. aside from being
practically kidnapped...

362
00:22:17.045 --> 00:22:19.086
I'll tell you later.

363
00:22:19.172 --> 00:22:21.922
Listen. something else happened
that was really weird. Jesse.

364
00:22:24.761 --> 00:22:26.293
Oh. my God. I gotta let you go.

365
00:22:26.387 --> 00:22:27.970
I'll talk to you later. okay?

366
00:22:30.308 --> 00:22:31.799
Better not let Elizabeth
catch you.

367
00:22:31.893 --> 00:22:34.635
-Right. I know. right.
-Work call?

368
00:22:34.729 --> 00:22:37.855
Uh. sorry. it's.
it's really none of my business.

369
00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:42.142
I wanted to talk to you alone.
I have a business proposal.

370
00:22:42.236 --> 00:22:44.478
Kat sure wasn't kidding
about the FIL and business.

371
00:22:44.572 --> 00:22:45.646
-What did you have in mind?
-Well...

372
00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:47.323
Last year I developed an app

373
00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:50.659
that I think would be perfect
for Lush Designs.

374
00:22:50.787 --> 00:22:52.986
You know what. we've been
concentrating so much

375
00:22:53.081 --> 00:22:55.164
on our physical stores. our
online presence has suffered.

376
00:22:55.291 --> 00:22:57.491
Well. with my app
your customers would not only

377
00:22:57.585 --> 00:23:00.044
be able to try on
the designs virtually.

378
00:23:00.129 --> 00:23:02.463
but they could explore
possible modifications.

379
00:23:02.548 --> 00:23:05.633
With your designs. my app will
practically allow the jewelry

380
00:23:05.718 --> 00:23:07.334
to sell itself.

381
00:23:07.428 --> 00:23:10.596
I like the sound of that.
To be continued.

382
00:23:16.229 --> 00:23:17.686
There you are!

383
00:23:17.814 --> 00:23:18.938
Hi.

384
00:23:21.317 --> 00:23:24.610
I'm sorry we didn't get a chance
to speak further.

385
00:23:24.695 --> 00:23:26.520
Oh. thank you.

386
00:23:26.614 --> 00:23:28.355
I'd love to learn more
about the FIL.

387
00:23:28.449 --> 00:23:30.282
It's an impressive group
that supports

388
00:23:30.368 --> 00:23:31.784
so many wonderful charities.

389
00:23:31.869 --> 00:23:34.194
I'd be honored to join
these amazing women.

390
00:23:34.288 --> 00:23:36.196
That's wonderful.
there are a few more formalities

391
00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:37.998
to attend to. but I believe

392
00:23:38.084 --> 00:23:41.034
you're a perfect fit
for the FIL.

393
00:23:41.129 --> 00:23:43.036
Everyone seemed to enjoy
meeting you.

394
00:23:43.131 --> 00:23:45.297
including Becca.
and that's no small feat.

395
00:23:46.968 --> 00:23:48.384
I'll be in touch this week.

396
00:23:48.511 --> 00:23:51.378
If all goes as I believe
it will. we'll announce you

397
00:23:51.472 --> 00:23:53.547
formally on the yacht excursion
this weekend.

398
00:23:53.641 --> 00:23:55.716
-Yacht excursion?
-Is there a problem?

399
00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:58.144
-No.
-I didn't think so.

400
00:23:58.229 --> 00:24:01.605
Lovely meeting you.
Excuse me.

401
00:24:03.943 --> 00:24:05.109
Helen!

402
00:24:20.001 --> 00:24:21.333
What the...

403
00:25:28.778 --> 00:25:31.862
If she discovers anything else
missing. have her contact me.

404
00:25:31.948 --> 00:25:33.781
My number's on the card
I gave her.

405
00:25:33.866 --> 00:25:35.950
Okay. Thank you very much.
officer.

406
00:25:52.426 --> 00:25:53.801
Are you okay?

407
00:26:02.019 --> 00:26:03.936
-No. Hey.

408
00:26:05.648 --> 00:26:07.014
Don't worry.
They're gonna get the guy.

409
00:26:07.108 --> 00:26:09.683
They're gonna get
the jewelry back.

410
00:26:09.777 --> 00:26:12.152
It's not about the jewels.

411
00:26:12.238 --> 00:26:16.073
Having the police here
brought back so many memories.

412
00:26:17.577 --> 00:26:21.537
How helpless I felt
when my mother died.

413
00:26:28.129 --> 00:26:30.754
-Come here.
-And everything's a mess.

414
00:26:32.341 --> 00:26:34.008
-What. here?
-Yeah.

415
00:26:34.093 --> 00:26:35.009
Don't...

416
00:26:36.762 --> 00:26:40.547
Do not. do not even worry
about it. okay?

417
00:26:40.641 --> 00:26:43.058
I'm gonna clean all this up.

418
00:28:14.318 --> 00:28:16.476
-Oh.

419
00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:18.487
I thought you'd gone.

420
00:28:18.614 --> 00:28:21.073
No. of course not. I wouldn't
leave without saying goodbye.

421
00:28:21.158 --> 00:28:22.783
-Aww.
-Here. I made some coffee.

422
00:28:22.868 --> 00:28:25.119
-Thanks for opening the door.
-Oh. you're welcome.

423
00:28:25.204 --> 00:28:28.321
Well. how did you sleep
last night?

424
00:28:28.416 --> 00:28:30.791
Very well.
Thank you for staying.

425
00:28:30.876 --> 00:28:32.159
Of course. My pleasure.

426
00:28:32.253 --> 00:28:33.493
You know if you'd like. uh.

427
00:28:33.587 --> 00:28:35.337
I could stay a few more nights.

428
00:28:35.464 --> 00:28:38.665
Thank you. Jesse. really.
oh. but I'm not sure

429
00:28:38.759 --> 00:28:40.634
we're quite ready for that
just yet.

430
00:28:43.889 --> 00:28:45.505
Okay.

431
00:28:45.599 --> 00:28:49.143
But just so you know.

432
00:28:49.228 --> 00:28:53.313
whenever you are ready.
I'm here. okay?

433
00:28:57.153 --> 00:28:58.351
You should've
called me.

434
00:28:58.446 --> 00:28:59.862
I wasn't alone.

435
00:29:00.531 --> 00:29:01.947
Yeah. I'm glad.

436
00:29:05.286 --> 00:29:08.120
Something else happened
yesterday.

437
00:29:09.165 --> 00:29:12.365
-Earl showed up.
-What?

438
00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:14.668
-I know.
-He...

439
00:29:14.754 --> 00:29:16.670
When I read the article. I knew
he was gonna come crawling back.

440
00:29:16.756 --> 00:29:19.590
I hope you kicked his sorry butt
to the curb.

441
00:29:24.221 --> 00:29:26.046
How can you even think
about talking to him?

442
00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:27.765
It's hard to explain.

443
00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:31.435
After your mom died.
you were convinced

444
00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.437
he had something to do with it.

445
00:29:36.484 --> 00:29:38.892
I never told you this.

446
00:29:38.986 --> 00:29:41.487
but mom and I fought that day

447
00:29:41.572 --> 00:29:43.572
about me spending the night
at your house.

448
00:29:43.699 --> 00:29:46.950
I was so mad at her.
I wouldn't even listen to her.

449
00:29:47.036 --> 00:29:50.913
And I said things
that I still regret.

450
00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:54.917
Later I snuck out
while she and Earl were arguing.

451
00:29:55.044 --> 00:29:56.243
Syl. I don't. I don't see how--

452
00:29:56.337 --> 00:29:58.545
When I got home
the next morning.

453
00:29:58.631 --> 00:30:02.299
Earl told me
she was mad I left.

454
00:30:02.384 --> 00:30:06.637
She took off and he didn't know
where she was.

455
00:30:10.851 --> 00:30:13.435
I should've stayed home.

456
00:30:13.562 --> 00:30:15.062
Maybe things would've been
different.

457
00:30:15.147 --> 00:30:17.397
maybe she wouldn't have gone out
on that boat alone.

458
00:30:17.483 --> 00:30:19.858
Syl. you know
that you are not to blame.

459
00:30:20.694 --> 00:30:21.652
I know.

460
00:30:23.823 --> 00:30:25.364
But I realized
it. it just. it wasn't fair

461
00:30:25.449 --> 00:30:26.940
for me to blame Earl either.

462
00:30:27.034 --> 00:30:31.278
Mom loved sailing.
She said it cleared her mind.

463
00:30:31.372 --> 00:30:32.946
It was an accident.

464
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.123
Do you really believe that?

465
00:30:37.545 --> 00:30:40.453
You know. Vanessa. I'm
very excited about your app.

466
00:30:40.548 --> 00:30:43.215
It just. it seems tailor-made
for Lush Designs

467
00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:45.425
and it shows a real
understanding of jewelry design.

468
00:30:45.511 --> 00:30:47.961
Mm-hmm. I was hoping
you'd feel that way.

469
00:30:48.055 --> 00:30:50.264
I...

470
00:30:50.349 --> 00:30:52.966
It must've taken you
a long time.

471
00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:54.226
It's hard to believe
you developed it

472
00:30:54.311 --> 00:30:57.020
without negotiating
a deal first.

473
00:30:57.106 --> 00:31:00.899
Truth is.
it was originally developed

474
00:31:00.985 --> 00:31:02.609
for a different type
of business.

475
00:31:02.695 --> 00:31:06.154
but thanks to my soon-to-be ex.
a gemstone dealer.

476
00:31:06.282 --> 00:31:09.149
I realized it could be adapted
perfectly for jewelry design.

477
00:31:09.243 --> 00:31:10.409
Is there any chance
he could claim?

478
00:31:10.494 --> 00:31:12.652
No. thanks
to a rock-solid prenup.

479
00:31:12.746 --> 00:31:16.498
my lawyer says that our split
will be swift and equitable.

480
00:31:16.625 --> 00:31:18.208
The app is mine.

481
00:31:18.294 --> 00:31:20.210
-You must have a good lawyer.
-Yes.

482
00:31:20.296 --> 00:31:23.797
I am so glad
that I took her advice.

483
00:31:23.883 --> 00:31:26.758
-Now. about the app...

484
00:31:26.844 --> 00:31:28.969
I think we have a deal.
what do you say we head back

485
00:31:29.054 --> 00:31:30.637
to my office
and iron out the details. hm?

486
00:31:30.723 --> 00:31:32.672
-Ooh.

487
00:31:32.766 --> 00:31:34.766
-Uh...
-Oh. yeah.

488
00:31:34.852 --> 00:31:39.104
Hi. Ronnie.
Uh. no. not for a bit.

489
00:31:40.232 --> 00:31:42.065
Whoa. slow down.

490
00:31:44.236 --> 00:31:46.853
O-okay. Yeah.

491
00:31:46.947 --> 00:31:48.488
Sure. I'll be there in a minute.

492
00:31:50.034 --> 00:31:51.524
I'm sorry. I need to head back
to the office.

493
00:31:51.619 --> 00:31:53.285
No problem. I'll have Corey
call to reschedule.

494
00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:56.038
Great. uh. if you wanna send
over some sample designs.

495
00:31:56.165 --> 00:31:57.864
I'll add it to the app
for you to try.

496
00:31:57.958 --> 00:31:59.416
-Perfect.

497
00:31:59.501 --> 00:32:03.128
Um. Sylvia. there is something

498
00:32:03.213 --> 00:32:06.840
that you need to know
before we sign any contracts.

499
00:32:06.926 --> 00:32:08.675
Sounds serious.

500
00:32:08.761 --> 00:32:11.094
It could be
if I'm not upfront with you.

501
00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:14.214
Um. my ex is

502
00:32:14.308 --> 00:32:16.350
Jesse Reynolds.

503
00:32:16.435 --> 00:32:18.051
I believe you know him.

504
00:32:18.145 --> 00:32:21.721
Yes. he supplies a lot
of our jewels for Lush Designs.

505
00:32:21.815 --> 00:32:24.149
I think you know him
a little better than that.

506
00:32:24.234 --> 00:32:26.276
Trust me.
I don't need any details.

507
00:32:26.362 --> 00:32:28.904
I just wanna be straight
with you.

508
00:32:30.157 --> 00:32:32.240
Yup. Okay. talk soon.

509
00:32:44.338 --> 00:32:46.922
-Hello?
-It's Becca Brown.

510
00:32:47.049 --> 00:32:50.467
-Oh. hi. Becca. how are you?
-Wonderful. as always. Uh. so...

511
00:32:50.552 --> 00:32:52.419
Listen. I'm gonna be
near your office tomorrow.

512
00:32:52.513 --> 00:32:54.054
so I thought I'd stop by at 2:00

513
00:32:54.139 --> 00:32:56.089
and we can discuss
our joint media campaign.

514
00:32:56.183 --> 00:32:58.016
Well. I actually have
a previous commitment. Becca--

515
00:32:58.102 --> 00:32:59.592
I'll see you then.

516
00:32:59.687 --> 00:33:01.937
Oh. okay. All right.

517
00:34:04.084 --> 00:34:06.993
-That was surprise.

518
00:34:07.087 --> 00:34:08.995
Are you crazy? Why would you
scare me like that?

519
00:34:09.089 --> 00:34:10.497
You told me
you had plans tonight.

520
00:34:10.591 --> 00:34:12.332
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

521
00:34:12.426 --> 00:34:14.334
I'm sorry.
I had a long day today.

522
00:34:14.428 --> 00:34:16.803
Okay. come here.

523
00:34:19.058 --> 00:34:20.640
Hm.

524
00:34:20.726 --> 00:34:22.675
Hey. Guess what?

525
00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:25.187
I got you Gino's. your favorite.

526
00:34:26.648 --> 00:34:28.523
Then we shouldn't
let it get cold.

527
00:34:34.281 --> 00:34:36.364
You're not eating. Is something
wrong with your food?

528
00:34:36.492 --> 00:34:37.783
No. it's good.

529
00:34:42.706 --> 00:34:43.914
Hey.

530
00:34:50.798 --> 00:34:53.131
Something is on your mind.

531
00:34:53.217 --> 00:34:54.707
Come on. I wanna. I wanna know
what you're thinking.

532
00:34:54.802 --> 00:34:56.042
You can talk to me. come on.

533
00:34:56.136 --> 00:34:58.011
I wanna know everything
about you.

534
00:34:58.097 --> 00:34:59.712
You already do.

535
00:34:59.807 --> 00:35:03.141
It's all out there
for anyone to read.

536
00:35:03.227 --> 00:35:06.386
I just realized today
I don't know anything about you.

537
00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.438
I'll tell you
whatever you wanna know.

538
00:35:08.524 --> 00:35:10.273
Is your divorce final?

539
00:35:14.947 --> 00:35:16.113
Uh. well. I...
Who told you that?

540
00:35:16.198 --> 00:35:19.232
You told me
your marriage was over.

541
00:35:19.326 --> 00:35:21.234
You told me
your divorce was final.

542
00:35:21.328 --> 00:35:23.036
Yeah. Who have you been
talking to?

543
00:35:23.122 --> 00:35:25.580
Why won't you answer
my question?

544
00:35:25.707 --> 00:35:28.375
Uh. because it's.

545
00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:32.379
it's complicated. okay?

546
00:35:32.464 --> 00:35:35.248
And. uh. yes.

547
00:35:35.342 --> 00:35:37.717
our marriage ended
a long time ago.

548
00:35:37.803 --> 00:35:40.220
We're now just finally making it
official. but she's fighting it.

549
00:35:40.305 --> 00:35:42.922
-Vanessa's fighting it?
-Yeah.

550
00:35:43.016 --> 00:35:45.976
-That's not what I heard.
-From who?

551
00:35:46.061 --> 00:35:49.104
Someone at the FIL?

552
00:35:49.231 --> 00:35:53.817
All right. you know. just be
careful who you trust there.

553
00:35:53.902 --> 00:35:55.235
I warned you about them.

554
00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.070
This-this is why
you didn't want me

555
00:35:57.156 --> 00:35:59.272
to join the FIL.

556
00:35:59.366 --> 00:36:02.617
You didn't want Vanessa
finding out about us.

557
00:36:02.744 --> 00:36:05.612
Does she know?
Did you tell her about it?

558
00:36:05.706 --> 00:36:07.831
Because we agreed
to keep this quiet.

559
00:36:10.169 --> 00:36:12.669
I thought we were separating
business from pleasure.

560
00:36:12.754 --> 00:36:15.589
I didn't realize you were
just protecting yourself.

561
00:36:15.674 --> 00:36:17.790
Are you worried about
the settlement from your divorce

562
00:36:17.885 --> 00:36:20.302
or the. getting the app?

563
00:36:21.889 --> 00:36:23.096
What do you know about the app?

564
00:36:23.182 --> 00:36:25.390
I just spent
the entire afternoon

565
00:36:25.475 --> 00:36:28.468
negotiating
with your soon-to-be ex-wife

566
00:36:28.562 --> 00:36:30.061
about using it for Lush Designs.

567
00:36:30.147 --> 00:36:32.805
Well. I hate to break it to you.
but Vanessa is a liar.

568
00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:34.641
How do you think
she's gotten so far?

569
00:36:34.735 --> 00:36:35.650
And this is how you treat me

570
00:36:35.777 --> 00:36:37.810
after I do something really nice
for you?

571
00:36:37.905 --> 00:36:38.987
Thanks.

572
00:37:03.347 --> 00:37:05.171
This is
Jesse. Leave a message.

573
00:37:05.265 --> 00:37:07.474
Jesse. we have some things
we need to discuss.

574
00:37:11.271 --> 00:37:13.605
Latte with two sugars.

575
00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:15.357
You remembered.

576
00:37:15.484 --> 00:37:17.651
I prefer it black now.
though. so...

577
00:37:17.736 --> 00:37:20.779
-Oh. I-I-I didn't know.
-How would you?

578
00:37:20.864 --> 00:37:23.690
You abandoned me
over a decade ago.

579
00:37:23.784 --> 00:37:26.409
You know. you say that
like you were a child.

580
00:37:26.495 --> 00:37:28.745
You were a legal adult. Sylvia.

581
00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:31.030
I was a confused high-schooler.

582
00:37:31.124 --> 00:37:33.959
I'd just lost the most important
person in my life.

583
00:37:34.795 --> 00:37:36.044
So had I.

584
00:37:37.547 --> 00:37:40.215
Look. I'm sorry
that I wasn't stronger.

585
00:37:40.342 --> 00:37:42.175
and I'm sorry
that I took to drinking.

586
00:37:42.261 --> 00:37:43.710
You started drinking
long before mom died.

587
00:37:43.804 --> 00:37:45.712
It just got worse after.

588
00:37:45.806 --> 00:37:48.848
Yeah. well. you know.
I got lots of regrets.

589
00:37:48.934 --> 00:37:52.018
I'm just grateful that
my weakness didn't affect you.

590
00:37:55.649 --> 00:37:58.558
You think because I'm successful

591
00:37:58.652 --> 00:38:01.444
that your weakness
didn't affect me?

592
00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:04.906
Your weakness affected
every decision of my life.

593
00:38:05.033 --> 00:38:08.067
every relationship
I've ever been in.

594
00:38:08.161 --> 00:38:12.539
Because of you. it's still
hard for me to trust anybody

595
00:38:12.624 --> 00:38:14.574
besides Claire...

596
00:38:14.668 --> 00:38:16.668
Who knows where I'd be if
it hadn't been for her family!

597
00:38:16.753 --> 00:38:18.244
I'm-I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it that way.

598
00:38:18.338 --> 00:38:20.714
Did you even care where I was?
If I was safe?

599
00:38:20.799 --> 00:38:22.757
Of course I did.

600
00:38:22.884 --> 00:38:24.250
Look. when I got my life
together.

601
00:38:24.344 --> 00:38:27.420
I wanted to see you.
I missed you.

602
00:38:27.514 --> 00:38:29.556
You know. when I read
that article in the paper

603
00:38:29.641 --> 00:38:31.933
about your past. I thought
you understood the demons

604
00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:33.560
that I was fighting back then.

605
00:38:33.645 --> 00:38:35.270
I mean. that article
gave me hope

606
00:38:35.397 --> 00:38:38.765
that. that we could reconnect.

607
00:38:38.859 --> 00:38:41.151
I just wanna be
a part of your life again.

608
00:38:42.362 --> 00:38:45.104
-That'll take some time.
-Yeah.

609
00:38:45.198 --> 00:38:48.450
And I need to know the truth
about mom.

610
00:38:49.578 --> 00:38:52.120
What happened between you two?

611
00:38:52.247 --> 00:38:54.947
She was acting strange that day.

612
00:38:55.042 --> 00:38:58.543
I wanted to blame you
because I'd heard you fighting.

613
00:38:58.628 --> 00:39:01.129
and you wouldn't even explain
afterwards.

614
00:39:02.883 --> 00:39:05.133
Truth can be a tricky thing.
Sylvia.

615
00:39:06.219 --> 00:39:08.011
It's not always easy to hear.

616
00:39:10.265 --> 00:39:13.308
Why did she go out
on that boat so upset?

617
00:39:13.435 --> 00:39:16.394
Was it really because of me?

618
00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:19.472
Look. I didn't wanna say
anything then.

619
00:39:19.566 --> 00:39:22.859
You idolized your mother. You...

620
00:39:24.404 --> 00:39:25.862
Oh. God.

621
00:39:27.783 --> 00:39:29.366
Your mother was. um...

622
00:39:31.078 --> 00:39:32.118
Your-your mother had an affair.

623
00:39:32.204 --> 00:39:34.821
She loved you.

624
00:39:34.915 --> 00:39:38.991
She wouldn't let either of us
give up on you.

625
00:39:39.086 --> 00:39:41.994
She would never have done that.

626
00:39:42.089 --> 00:39:44.497
-Who was it?
-Does it matter?

627
00:39:44.591 --> 00:39:47.500
Yes. It matters to me.

628
00:39:47.594 --> 00:39:49.761
I need to know all of it
to understand.

629
00:39:51.223 --> 00:39:54.182
He worked with her.
You didn't know him.

630
00:39:56.937 --> 00:40:01.347
I promise not to withhold
the truth from you again.

631
00:40:01.441 --> 00:40:03.850
All this. this is a lot.

632
00:40:03.944 --> 00:40:06.736
Yeah. I know it is. baby girl.
I know.

633
00:40:09.199 --> 00:40:11.858
You didn't have to see me
back to my office. but thanks.

634
00:40:11.952 --> 00:40:14.026
Well. I didn't want you
to be alone.

635
00:40:14.121 --> 00:40:17.363
That was quite a bombshell
I dropped on you.

636
00:40:17.457 --> 00:40:19.165
I'm still having trouble
believing it.

637
00:40:19.251 --> 00:40:21.376
I understand. Hey. look.
I'm here for you now. baby girl.

638
00:40:21.503 --> 00:40:23.795
I'm-I'm not ready to forgive
and forget. Just. just talk.

639
00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:25.463
Sorry. absolutely.

640
00:40:25.549 --> 00:40:26.548
Sylvia.

641
00:40:28.343 --> 00:40:32.044
Oh. I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting this...

642
00:40:32.139 --> 00:40:33.471
Becca. you're early.

643
00:40:33.557 --> 00:40:35.765
I believe if you're not
five minutes early.

644
00:40:35.851 --> 00:40:36.933
you're late.

645
00:40:38.645 --> 00:40:41.062
You-you seem so familiar.
Have we met before?

646
00:40:41.189 --> 00:40:43.222
I don't know. Have we?

647
00:40:43.316 --> 00:40:45.483
My name's Earl.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

648
00:40:45.569 --> 00:40:48.945
Becca Brown. You know.
I never forget a handsome face.

649
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:51.239
Well. I'm sure I'll remember.

650
00:40:51.366 --> 00:40:53.399
If you'll excuse us.
we have a meeting.

651
00:40:53.493 --> 00:40:55.493
Certainly. Uh. we'll talk soon.

652
00:40:55.579 --> 00:40:57.203
Becca Brown.
it was a pleasure meeting you.

653
00:40:57.289 --> 00:40:58.455
Hm.

654
00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:03.877
Well. I think he's a little
too old for you. Sylvia.

655
00:41:03.962 --> 00:41:06.045
but he's very charming.

656
00:41:06.882 --> 00:41:09.132
Becca. Earl's my father.

657
00:41:11.303 --> 00:41:12.552
Hm.

658
00:41:14.931 --> 00:41:17.223
Do we have a deal?

659
00:41:17.309 --> 00:41:19.934
You've convinced me.
I think the joint media campaign

660
00:41:20.061 --> 00:41:21.728
is a brilliant idea.

661
00:41:21.813 --> 00:41:24.597
I'm glad. I'm very excited
to work with you.

662
00:41:24.691 --> 00:41:28.109
Thank you. Oh. so beautiful.

663
00:41:28.236 --> 00:41:30.862
Who. uh. sources your jewels?

664
00:41:30.947 --> 00:41:33.773
Jesse Reynolds.
Do you know him?

665
00:41:33.867 --> 00:41:36.159
Unfortunately. He's married
to a friend of mine.

666
00:41:36.244 --> 00:41:37.610
They're going through
a nasty divorce.

667
00:41:37.704 --> 00:41:40.079
Apparently. Jesse's business

668
00:41:40.165 --> 00:41:42.707
relies on funding
from my friend.

669
00:41:44.377 --> 00:41:45.952
Be careful that his troubles

670
00:41:46.046 --> 00:41:49.622
don't become your troubles. Hm?

671
00:41:49.716 --> 00:41:52.509
Send over the contracts. I'll
have my lawyers review them.

672
00:41:52.594 --> 00:41:54.469
Oh. I'll see myself out.

673
00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:01.726
Wait. did the deal fall through?

674
00:42:01.811 --> 00:42:03.937
No. she loved the concept.

675
00:42:04.022 --> 00:42:06.022
Okay. that's great.
But why did you both look so--

676
00:42:06.107 --> 00:42:08.691
Corey. could you have head
of security come to my office?

677
00:42:08.777 --> 00:42:10.693
Yeah. I'll call him now.

678
00:42:26.586 --> 00:42:28.753
Captain Spinks will have
the champagne chilled

679
00:42:28.838 --> 00:42:31.831
and ready to pour when we arrive
at the boat on Saturday.

680
00:42:31.925 --> 00:42:33.666
And what time do we set sail?

681
00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:35.668
I had to give my invitation
to Sylvia.

682
00:42:35.762 --> 00:42:37.178
and I haven't written it down.

683
00:42:37.305 --> 00:42:39.097
Well. I didn't send one to her
because I thought

684
00:42:39.182 --> 00:42:40.890
we were discussing
her membership today.

685
00:42:40.976 --> 00:42:42.350
My mistake.

686
00:42:42.477 --> 00:42:44.343
How did your meeting go
with Sylvia?

687
00:42:44.437 --> 00:42:46.396
Oh. you know.
everything seems to be in order.

688
00:42:46.481 --> 00:42:49.015
I think she has a lot to offer
the FIL.

689
00:42:49.109 --> 00:42:51.442
Excellent.

690
00:42:51.528 --> 00:42:54.020
-And I even met her father.
-Oh!

691
00:42:54.114 --> 00:42:56.155
I thought Sylvia and her father
were estranged.

692
00:42:56.241 --> 00:42:58.241
That's what I read.
you know. if I were her.

693
00:42:58.326 --> 00:43:00.359
I wouldn't wanna see him again.

694
00:43:00.453 --> 00:43:02.453
I found her father
perfectly charming.

695
00:43:02.539 --> 00:43:04.038
Charming or handsome?

696
00:43:04.165 --> 00:43:06.165
You've been known to confuse
good looks

697
00:43:06.251 --> 00:43:07.834
for a winning personality.

698
00:43:07.919 --> 00:43:10.211
and they haven't all proven
to be winners.

699
00:43:12.007 --> 00:43:13.840
I don't care
for what you're insinuating.

700
00:43:13.925 --> 00:43:16.375
I mean. he was my type.

701
00:43:16.469 --> 00:43:18.469
And I think I've met him before.

702
00:43:18.555 --> 00:43:21.097
And once I figure it out.
I intend to rekindle

703
00:43:21.182 --> 00:43:24.058
whatever fire we had
between us.

704
00:43:24.185 --> 00:43:28.563
Just do me a favor and look
before you leap this time.

705
00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:30.690
With your taste in men.

706
00:43:30.775 --> 00:43:33.559
you should do a background check
before you get involved.

707
00:43:33.653 --> 00:43:37.238
Send Sylvia her invitation.

708
00:43:37.365 --> 00:43:41.400
We will be announcing the newest
member of the FIL Saturday.

709
00:43:41.494 --> 00:43:42.619
on the boat.

710
00:43:45.206 --> 00:43:48.207
I'm excited Sylvia's joining.
Aren't you. Becca?

711
00:43:50.003 --> 00:43:52.211
-What's wrong. Becca?
-Hm?

712
00:43:52.297 --> 00:43:54.172
Oh. no. nothing.

713
00:43:54.257 --> 00:43:57.342
I was just thinking
that maybe Elizabeth is right.

714
00:43:57.427 --> 00:43:59.927
and maybe I should have
my people do some research

715
00:44:00.055 --> 00:44:02.889
on Earl Stafford.
get an edge on the competition.

716
00:44:05.185 --> 00:44:07.927
-Bye. Becca.
-You think I'm kidding?

717
00:44:08.021 --> 00:44:11.097
-I'm just saying.
-I think it's a brilliant idea.

718
00:44:11.191 --> 00:44:12.598
-Of course you do.
-What?

719
00:44:12.692 --> 00:44:14.484
I can't believe
I didn't think about it before.

720
00:44:14.569 --> 00:44:15.902
You sure
you're okay. 'cause

721
00:44:15.987 --> 00:44:17.362
Luke and I can go
another weekend.

722
00:44:17.447 --> 00:44:19.197
No. no. no. no.
You guys need this.

723
00:44:19.282 --> 00:44:21.607
I'm fine. I actually. uh.

724
00:44:21.701 --> 00:44:24.702
have plans with the FIL
this weekend.

725
00:44:24.788 --> 00:44:28.948
Oh. do tell. Where are they
kidnapping you to next?

726
00:44:29.042 --> 00:44:31.959
This time
I will be driving myself.

727
00:44:32.087 --> 00:44:35.922
We're going to the marina
for a boat excursion.

728
00:44:36.007 --> 00:44:38.174
-And you're okay with that?
-I'm a little nervous.

729
00:44:38.259 --> 00:44:40.968
But they promised
the champagne will be flowing.

730
00:44:41.096 --> 00:44:44.296
and I think I'll need it
when this week is over.

731
00:44:44.391 --> 00:44:47.225
Yeah. it's been a rough one.

732
00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:49.468
It's not over yet.

733
00:44:49.562 --> 00:44:51.145
I'm ending things with Jesse.

734
00:44:51.272 --> 00:44:54.440
-It's Jesse? Jesse? Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

735
00:44:54.526 --> 00:44:55.975
I get why you didn't wanna
tell me.

736
00:44:56.069 --> 00:44:57.276
Mm-hmm.

737
00:44:57.362 --> 00:45:00.146
Syl. I'm sorry. Come here.

738
00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:01.781
You're gonna be okay.

739
00:45:03.702 --> 00:45:06.160
God. I don't know what I'd do
without you.

740
00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:36.829
Dad?

741
00:48:37.582 --> 00:48:39.498
Oh. hey. Sylvia.

742
00:48:39.584 --> 00:48:41.533
Happy 18th. Happy 18th.

743
00:48:41.628 --> 00:48:46.005
You got no idea how long
I've been waiting for this day.

744
00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:48.874
You know. I've been thinking.
I think it's time that you. uh.

745
00:48:48.968 --> 00:48:52.044
spread your wings. fly. fly!

746
00:48:52.138 --> 00:48:55.547
Packed your bags for ya.

747
00:48:55.642 --> 00:48:57.975
Dad. what's this all about?

748
00:48:58.061 --> 00:49:00.886
It's about you talking behind
my back to that little friend

749
00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:03.022
of yours. Claire.
yeah. for months.

750
00:49:03.107 --> 00:49:05.557
saying I had something to do
with your mother's death!

751
00:49:05.652 --> 00:49:07.818
Your mother's death!
I wasn't even on the boat.

752
00:49:07.904 --> 00:49:11.530
You're an adult now. so you take
your suspicions and you get out!

753
00:49:11.616 --> 00:49:13.399
-Get out!
-I don't have any money. dad.

754
00:49:13.493 --> 00:49:15.326
Oh. gee. what
a coinkydink. Neither do I.

755
00:49:15.411 --> 00:49:17.787
You've been like an anvil
around my neck.

756
00:49:17.872 --> 00:49:21.248
I can't wait to get rid of you
and be free!

757
00:49:21.376 --> 00:49:23.042
You got a problem with that?

758
00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:27.588
You take it up with her.

759
00:49:27.715 --> 00:49:29.006
Now get out!

760
00:50:24.897 --> 00:50:26.972
Let me finish
the outline.

761
00:50:27.066 --> 00:50:31.027
But it tickles.
Okay. I'm done.

762
00:50:31.112 --> 00:50:33.979
Now let's design
you a ring.

763
00:50:34.073 --> 00:50:38.075
I want a heart.
because you are my heart.

764
00:50:38.161 --> 00:50:40.202
Mom. so lame.

765
00:50:40.288 --> 00:50:44.165
Love is not lame.

766
00:50:44.292 --> 00:50:46.876
I love you. Sylvia.

767
00:50:46.961 --> 00:50:48.586
I love you. too. mom.

768
00:51:08.524 --> 00:51:10.858
What? What's this?

769
00:51:27.752 --> 00:51:30.461
Mom. who is this?

770
00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:40.712
-Good morning. you.
-Oh. good morning.

771
00:51:40.807 --> 00:51:44.216
-Here you go. Of course.
-Oh. thank you.

772
00:51:44.310 --> 00:51:45.717
-What's this?
-Oh.

773
00:51:45.812 --> 00:51:48.554
It's my sketchbook
from high school.

774
00:51:48.648 --> 00:51:50.722
I was drawing jewelry
long before

775
00:51:50.817 --> 00:51:53.609
I dreamed about starting
Lush Designs.

776
00:51:53.694 --> 00:51:54.944
Take a look.

777
00:51:56.322 --> 00:51:57.613
Thanks.

778
00:51:59.617 --> 00:52:04.236
You know. I thought about you
calling your designs doodles.

779
00:52:04.330 --> 00:52:06.413
They can be so much more
if you want.

780
00:52:08.417 --> 00:52:11.794
This could literally be
in Lush Designs' next catalog.

781
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:14.171
Oh. wow.

782
00:52:15.508 --> 00:52:17.550
Claire would love this one.

783
00:52:18.845 --> 00:52:21.095
You've always been so talented.

784
00:52:21.222 --> 00:52:24.590
I see the same kind of talent
in you.

785
00:52:24.684 --> 00:52:26.892
I'd like to help you
if you'll let me.

786
00:52:26.978 --> 00:52:29.728
-Yeah? Uh-huh?
-Mm-hmm.

787
00:52:29.814 --> 00:52:31.605
Thank you. I'd like that.

788
00:52:32.859 --> 00:52:34.766
Uh. Corey.

789
00:52:34.861 --> 00:52:38.937
what do you know
about DNA testing?

790
00:52:39.031 --> 00:52:41.773
What? You think
Jesse's someone's baby daddy?

791
00:52:41.868 --> 00:52:44.109
What? No
Why would you bring up Jesse?

792
00:52:44.203 --> 00:52:45.744
Oh. my God! Come on!

793
00:52:45.830 --> 00:52:47.413
We both know
you have something going on.

794
00:52:47.498 --> 00:52:49.582
-No.
-Don't deny it.

795
00:52:49.667 --> 00:52:52.668
-I...
-Look.

796
00:52:52.753 --> 00:52:56.213
If Jesse thins
he's someone's father.

797
00:52:56.299 --> 00:52:59.967
I think he just needs
to work that out for himself.

798
00:53:01.679 --> 00:53:04.630
Well. he's not the one.

799
00:53:04.724 --> 00:53:09.268
Oh. Oh. so you think
he's the father?

800
00:53:10.813 --> 00:53:14.231
Uh. the same thing happened
to my brother.

801
00:53:14.317 --> 00:53:18.277
His ex-girlfriend claims that
he was the father of her child.

802
00:53:18.362 --> 00:53:19.904
-What did he do?
-Well...

803
00:53:19.989 --> 00:53:22.147
He snatched the kid's bottle
and gave it to me

804
00:53:22.241 --> 00:53:23.982
and I gave it to my friend
that works in a lab.

805
00:53:24.076 --> 00:53:25.651
-Did that work?
-Yeah.

806
00:53:25.745 --> 00:53:28.204
Turns out he wasn't the father.

807
00:53:28.289 --> 00:53:29.788
Do you think
your friend would help me?

808
00:53:29.874 --> 00:53:32.324
Oh. yeah.
She's a big fan of yours.

809
00:53:32.418 --> 00:53:36.995
Look. don't worry about it.
I got you. okay?

810
00:53:37.089 --> 00:53:38.839
-Thank you.
-Of course.

811
00:53:47.433 --> 00:53:49.391
Hi. dad.

812
00:53:50.228 --> 00:53:52.436
Um. can you meet today?

813
00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:56.941
Hi.
I'm here to see Sylvia.

814
00:53:57.026 --> 00:53:59.318
-Yeah. of course. follow me.
-Thank you.

815
00:54:09.497 --> 00:54:12.030
Right this way.
Ms. Stafford will see you now.

816
00:54:12.124 --> 00:54:13.415
-Thank you.
-Of course.

817
00:54:13.501 --> 00:54:15.084
-Hi.
-Hi.

818
00:54:15.169 --> 00:54:17.169
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

819
00:54:20.299 --> 00:54:24.093
Um. before we start.
I have to ask.

820
00:54:26.472 --> 00:54:29.214
How did you know
Jesse and I were dating?

821
00:54:29.308 --> 00:54:33.218
I heard you on the phone
at the party.

822
00:54:33.312 --> 00:54:34.853
Hm. I...

823
00:54:34.939 --> 00:54:37.222
I know we planned to finalize
our agreement today.

824
00:54:37.316 --> 00:54:41.059
but I-I have to ask you a
couple of questions about Jesse.

825
00:54:41.153 --> 00:54:44.113
I... You haven't heard
about Becca?

826
00:54:44.198 --> 00:54:47.449
-What happened to Becca?
-Um...

827
00:54:47.535 --> 00:54:50.244
Becca died in her sleep
last night.

828
00:54:50.371 --> 00:54:54.072
-What?
-Her assistant found her. Um...

829
00:54:54.166 --> 00:54:57.293
They think it may have been
a. a heart attack.

830
00:54:58.796 --> 00:55:00.045
I...

831
00:55:01.173 --> 00:55:02.423
Thank you.

832
00:55:04.218 --> 00:55:06.218
She seemed like quite the force.

833
00:55:06.304 --> 00:55:07.511
Hm.

834
00:55:08.347 --> 00:55:10.922
She was.

835
00:55:11.017 --> 00:55:13.100
Right now she'd just be
telling me to stop blubbering

836
00:55:13.227 --> 00:55:14.259
and get down to business.

837
00:55:14.353 --> 00:55:15.561
Hey. hey. wait. wait. wait.

838
00:55:15.646 --> 00:55:17.855
-We can reschedule.
-No. Oh. no.

839
00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:19.598
I wanna talk about this now.

840
00:55:19.692 --> 00:55:23.068
Um. you seemed upset earlier.

841
00:55:24.739 --> 00:55:26.772
Let me guess.

842
00:55:26.866 --> 00:55:28.615
Jesse told you the app was his?

843
00:55:28.743 --> 00:55:33.612
He exploded when I told him
Lush Designs would be using it.

844
00:55:33.706 --> 00:55:36.782
I haven't talked to him since.
He's not answering my calls.

845
00:55:36.876 --> 00:55:39.951
Mm. typical Jesse.

846
00:55:40.046 --> 00:55:42.046
I don't play games.

847
00:55:42.131 --> 00:55:45.090
Not in my personal life
or in business.

848
00:55:46.218 --> 00:55:48.260
Is the app yours or Jesse's?

849
00:55:50.181 --> 00:55:53.265
Remember when I told you
I initially created the app

850
00:55:53.351 --> 00:55:55.801
for a different type
of product?

851
00:55:55.895 --> 00:55:59.304
Well. I intended it for Becca

852
00:55:59.398 --> 00:56:01.440
to use for her accessory lines.

853
00:56:01.525 --> 00:56:05.027
Scarves. hats. sunglasses.

854
00:56:05.112 --> 00:56:07.738
Imagine my surprise
when my assistant showed me

855
00:56:07.823 --> 00:56:10.532
an almost identical app
in the app store.

856
00:56:10.618 --> 00:56:13.652
I mean.
it was so similar to Becca's.

857
00:56:13.746 --> 00:56:17.498
it couldn't have been
a coincidence.

858
00:56:17.625 --> 00:56:21.168
I must've looked like you
when you saw Kat's ring at FIL.

859
00:56:21.295 --> 00:56:23.003
You knew the design was mine.

860
00:56:23.130 --> 00:56:26.298
I told you. I'm a fan.

861
00:56:26.384 --> 00:56:30.001
I saw your reaction and I knew
something was up with the ring.

862
00:56:30.096 --> 00:56:32.137
And then later. whenever
I heard you talking to Jesse.

863
00:56:32.223 --> 00:56:34.390
it was clear to me
what happened.

864
00:56:34.475 --> 00:56:37.267
So you think Jesse
stole my design for Claire?

865
00:56:38.604 --> 00:56:39.436
Don't you?

866
00:56:41.107 --> 00:56:42.514
I'm glad
you could make it.

867
00:56:42.608 --> 00:56:44.516
I didn't think
you'd call me so soon.

868
00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:48.019
I hope that meeting of yours
yesterday went well.

869
00:56:48.114 --> 00:56:50.781
You sure know
some impressive people.

870
00:56:50.866 --> 00:56:54.359
Hey. did that. that lovely lady.
did she remember me?

871
00:56:54.453 --> 00:56:56.361
-No. she-she didn't.
-Oh.

872
00:56:56.455 --> 00:56:58.705
Um. I doubt
Becca really knew you.

873
00:56:58.833 --> 00:57:02.126
You two didn't exactly run
in the same social circles.

874
00:57:02.211 --> 00:57:03.585
Didn't?

875
00:57:03.671 --> 00:57:05.921
-Join.
-Oh. sure.

876
00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:09.049
Oh...

877
00:57:11.262 --> 00:57:15.013
Um. Becca died in her sleep
last night.

878
00:57:16.142 --> 00:57:17.474
Oh. my.

879
00:57:18.477 --> 00:57:21.520
Uh. I am sorry to hear that.

880
00:57:21.605 --> 00:57:23.981
I was just getting to know her.
but a lot of people

881
00:57:24.066 --> 00:57:25.315
will miss her.

882
00:57:27.736 --> 00:57:29.611
Thanks for being
so patient with me.

883
00:57:29.697 --> 00:57:34.065
I never expected
to see you again. dad.

884
00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:36.910
I needed a little time
to get used to the idea

885
00:57:37.037 --> 00:57:39.455
of you being back in my life.

886
00:57:40.207 --> 00:57:42.082
Dad.

887
00:57:42.209 --> 00:57:44.743
I didn't think I'd hear you
call me that again.

888
00:57:44.837 --> 00:57:46.295
I'm trying.

889
00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:51.249
Honestly.
I'm still pretty upset to learn

890
00:57:51.343 --> 00:57:53.010
mom was cheating on you.

891
00:57:54.388 --> 00:57:55.596
I never should've told you that.

892
00:57:55.723 --> 00:57:57.639
No. I'm-I'm glad you told me.

893
00:57:57.725 --> 00:57:59.391
I wanted the truth.

894
00:57:59.477 --> 00:58:01.768
Just may take a while
for me to accept it.

895
00:58:01.896 --> 00:58:03.604
Of course. yeah.

896
00:58:03.731 --> 00:58:07.232
I-I'm just. I'm just so happy
that I'm in your life again.

897
00:58:08.694 --> 00:58:11.778
-We'll see.
-Okay.

898
00:58:11.906 --> 00:58:13.271
I should get back to the office.

899
00:58:13.365 --> 00:58:14.439
-So soon?
-Yeah.

900
00:58:14.533 --> 00:58:16.575
I have a busy day ahead of me.

901
00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:18.610
-Okay.
-Um...

902
00:58:18.704 --> 00:58:20.445
I can take that
if you're finished.

903
00:58:20.539 --> 00:58:22.781
Oh. uh. thank you. Sure. yeah.

904
00:58:22.875 --> 00:58:24.082
Of course.

905
00:58:33.969 --> 00:58:35.961
So you. uh. you remember.
when you were a kid.

906
00:58:36.055 --> 00:58:39.130
we used to come here
and you'd catch tadpoles?

907
00:58:39.225 --> 00:58:41.475
-Yeah.
-Get the fireflies at night?

908
00:58:41.602 --> 00:58:44.302
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah.

909
00:58:44.396 --> 00:58:46.104
Hey. do you. uh. do you suppose
your old man

910
00:58:46.190 --> 00:58:47.305
could get just one hug?

911
00:58:47.399 --> 00:58:49.441
Hm. Sure.

912
00:58:53.697 --> 00:58:56.114
Oh.

913
00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:57.783
-It was good seein' you. Okay.
-Okay. Yeah.

914
00:58:57.868 --> 00:59:00.619
-I'll see you later.
-All right.

915
00:59:00.704 --> 00:59:02.871
-Drive carefully.
-Yeah.

916
00:59:08.629 --> 00:59:10.829
Hey. there you are.

917
00:59:10.923 --> 00:59:13.006
-Fresh from the printer.
-Ooh.

918
00:59:15.761 --> 00:59:18.637
Oh. these look great. thank you

919
00:59:18.722 --> 00:59:19.805
for picking them up
on your lunch hour.

920
00:59:19.890 --> 00:59:21.473
Yeah. anytime. the printer

921
00:59:21.559 --> 00:59:23.892
was right next door
to my favorite deli.

922
00:59:23.978 --> 00:59:27.980
who. by the way.
have the best cookies.

923
00:59:28.065 --> 00:59:31.349
-You're too good to me.
-Yeah. that's probably true.

924
00:59:31.443 --> 00:59:35.320
Oh. um. Corey. remember what
we were talking about earlier?

925
00:59:35.406 --> 00:59:36.905
-Jessie's kid?
-Yes.

926
00:59:36.991 --> 00:59:40.117
Um. so I met up with. um. Jesse

927
00:59:40.202 --> 00:59:42.694
and I took the cup
he was drinking out of.

928
00:59:42.788 --> 00:59:46.915
and. um. I was wondering
if maybe you could...

929
00:59:47.001 --> 00:59:48.366
-Give it to my friend?
-Yeah.

930
00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:50.210
-Yeah. I can do that.
-Thank you.

931
00:59:50.337 --> 00:59:52.337
God. you move fast.

932
00:59:52.423 --> 00:59:54.673
But. you know. I'm gonna need
something from the kid as well.

933
00:59:54.758 --> 00:59:58.218
-Oh. that's the easy part.
-Get it. girl.

934
00:59:58.345 --> 01:00:02.380
So. wait.
how old is this kid. anyway?

935
01:00:02.474 --> 01:00:04.215
'Cause you gotta think about
what you're getting yourself

936
01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:09.187
into. like. are we talking
about homework or diapers or...

937
01:00:09.273 --> 01:00:11.222
What. am I jumping
too far ahead?

938
01:00:11.317 --> 01:00:13.692
No. no. that's not it.
I-I-I can't find the cup.

939
01:00:13.777 --> 01:00:16.320
-It's gone.
-What do you mean?

940
01:00:17.823 --> 01:00:19.698
Well. where did you have it?

941
01:00:23.037 --> 01:00:25.078
Did you actually get it?

942
01:01:09.792 --> 01:01:11.449
-It's been a long day. Jesse.
-Ah.

943
01:01:11.543 --> 01:01:14.211
-Well. hi.
-What are you doing here?

944
01:01:14.296 --> 01:01:16.254
I'm sorry. can we talk?

945
01:01:23.263 --> 01:01:25.806
I have to go grab something.
I'll be right back.

946
01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:29.893
I'll be here.

947
01:02:25.576 --> 01:02:26.867
Jesse.

948
01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.367
What's this?

949
01:02:36.462 --> 01:02:39.254
Stuff you left here.
I got it all together.

950
01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:46.887
Well...

951
01:02:47.014 --> 01:02:49.848
Babe. l-let's just leave it here
for the next time I come over.

952
01:02:49.933 --> 01:02:53.560
There's not gonna be
a next time. Jesse. We're done.

953
01:02:55.147 --> 01:02:57.689
Sylvia. you can't mean that.
Come on.

954
01:02:57.775 --> 01:02:59.775
Over a misunderstanding?
It was just a little lovers'--

955
01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:02.861
It was more than that.
and you know it.

956
01:03:02.946 --> 01:03:05.063
You lied to me.

957
01:03:05.157 --> 01:03:07.240
Yeah. babe. why don't we just
sit down and talk about it?

958
01:03:07.367 --> 01:03:09.400
It's-it's nothing
we can't get past.

959
01:03:09.495 --> 01:03:11.369
and I know you've also been
really stressed

960
01:03:11.455 --> 01:03:15.073
with your dad just showing up
out of the blue. and Vanessa...

961
01:03:15.167 --> 01:03:17.125
Let's-let's talk about Vanessa.
I-I wanna--

962
01:03:17.211 --> 01:03:19.461
She warned me you would play
this kind of game.

963
01:03:19.546 --> 01:03:21.254
She's a smart woman.

964
01:03:21.381 --> 01:03:22.798
I can't believe she put up
with stuff like this.

965
01:03:22.883 --> 01:03:24.800
Wow. okay.
so that's what's going on.

966
01:03:24.885 --> 01:03:27.418
She. uh. she poisoned you
against me.

967
01:03:27.513 --> 01:03:30.305
-No. I can think for myself.
-Really?

968
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:32.098
But she told me
about her experiences with you.

969
01:03:32.226 --> 01:03:34.926
and I realized
we had a lot in common.

970
01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:36.928
You have nothing in common.

971
01:03:37.022 --> 01:03:40.265
Believe me. you are one
of a kind. and what you and I--

972
01:03:40.359 --> 01:03:43.268
Oh. God. stop! Well. it's over!

973
01:03:43.362 --> 01:03:46.279
-Personally and professionally!
-What does that mean?

974
01:03:46.406 --> 01:03:49.699
It means I'm terminating your
contracts with Lush Designs.

975
01:03:49.785 --> 01:03:51.326
You can't do that.

976
01:03:51.411 --> 01:03:53.444
My legal team is already on it.

977
01:03:53.539 --> 01:03:55.997
You can't. you can't do that.

978
01:04:01.296 --> 01:04:03.621
You can't do that!

979
01:04:03.715 --> 01:04:05.590
You can't!

980
01:04:05.676 --> 01:04:08.218
Whatever you think has gone
wrong between you and I

981
01:04:08.303 --> 01:04:10.804
has nothing to do with business.
I supply Lush Designs

982
01:04:10.931 --> 01:04:13.223
with the highest-quality jewels
on the market!

983
01:04:14.434 --> 01:04:16.726
You are unbelievable.

984
01:04:16.812 --> 01:04:21.189
Everything you just did
I have on camera.

985
01:04:21.275 --> 01:04:23.233
Take a look.

986
01:04:28.615 --> 01:04:31.324
-That's not what it looks like.
-Hm.

987
01:04:31.451 --> 01:04:32.659
I was taking those
so that I could start

988
01:04:32.786 --> 01:04:34.452
outsourcing stones for you.

989
01:04:34.538 --> 01:04:36.413
Hm.

990
01:04:36.498 --> 01:04:39.332
-How dedicated you are. Jesse.
-Thank you.

991
01:04:39.459 --> 01:04:41.960
I spoke to my head of security
yesterday.

992
01:04:42.045 --> 01:04:43.795
He's been reviewing
our security measures

993
01:04:43.881 --> 01:04:47.665
and believes the breeches came
from outside of Lush Designs.

994
01:04:47.759 --> 01:04:50.051
I just got the proof.

995
01:04:50.137 --> 01:04:52.387
Sylvia. just. please.
let me explain--

996
01:04:52.472 --> 01:04:55.006
What is there to explain. Jesse?

997
01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:58.894
How you stole from Lush Designs
or how you broke in to my home?

998
01:04:58.979 --> 01:05:01.271
-I didn't break into your home.
-Oh. save it.

999
01:05:01.356 --> 01:05:04.357
Get out
or I'm calling the police.

1000
01:05:07.362 --> 01:05:08.686
You wouldn't.

1001
01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:11.781
Oh. I would. Oh. honey. I would.

1002
01:05:19.082 --> 01:05:20.373
Fine.

1003
01:05:21.084 --> 01:05:22.292
Fine.

1004
01:05:29.509 --> 01:05:32.802
Oh. and just so you know. I'm
not gonna let you trash my name.

1005
01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:37.182
Your name isn't worth trashing.

1006
01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:15.053
Mm. So I'm assuming
Jesse talked to you?

1007
01:06:15.138 --> 01:06:17.305
Oh...

1008
01:06:19.184 --> 01:06:21.759
-Yes. he called.
-Mm.

1009
01:06:21.853 --> 01:06:24.688
-And he was furious.
-Hm?

1010
01:06:24.773 --> 01:06:26.773
Can you believe
he blamed me for everything?

1011
01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:28.316
Yes. I can.

1012
01:06:29.736 --> 01:06:31.945
-I'm sorry.
-Oh. I'm not.

1013
01:06:33.699 --> 01:06:36.574
-It's nice of you to come over.
-Yeah.

1014
01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:40.111
Well. I guess I didn't really
have to worry about you.

1015
01:06:40.205 --> 01:06:43.248
I am embarrassed
to admit that...

1016
01:06:44.376 --> 01:06:47.952
despite Jesse's many betrayals.

1017
01:06:48.046 --> 01:06:50.714
I fell apart when we split up.

1018
01:06:50.799 --> 01:06:52.290
Aww. Things were different
for you.

1019
01:06:52.384 --> 01:06:54.217
You two were married.

1020
01:06:55.887 --> 01:06:57.637
Honestly. I went
into my relationship with him

1021
01:06:57.764 --> 01:06:59.848
like all my others.

1022
01:06:59.933 --> 01:07:02.434
looking for a way out.

1023
01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:05.970
We are opposites then.
I always run in. head-first.

1024
01:07:06.064 --> 01:07:08.806
sure that this guy is the one.

1025
01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:12.143
-Wish I could be like that.
-Oh. no.

1026
01:07:12.237 --> 01:07:16.364
It's lonely not letting anyone
get too close.

1027
01:07:16.450 --> 01:07:20.326
Well. maybe we can help
each other.

1028
01:07:20.454 --> 01:07:23.154
You keep me
from diving in too fast

1029
01:07:23.248 --> 01:07:25.323
and I'll keep you
from running away.

1030
01:07:25.417 --> 01:07:28.493
-I'll drink to that. Cheers.
-Yeah.

1031
01:07:28.587 --> 01:07:30.336
I can't believe
we ate it all.

1032
01:07:30.464 --> 01:07:32.964
Well. it had to be done.

1033
01:07:33.050 --> 01:07:35.675
-I better get going.
-You're welcome to stay.

1034
01:07:35.802 --> 01:07:40.263
Oh. that's sweet.
but I really oughta go.

1035
01:07:40.348 --> 01:07:43.016
Please stay? I'm nervous
about the boat trip tomorrow.

1036
01:07:43.143 --> 01:07:45.018
I-I don't like boats.

1037
01:07:45.145 --> 01:07:47.812
Do you get motion sickness?
I have an extra wristband.

1038
01:07:47.898 --> 01:07:50.273
No. it's not that. I...

1039
01:07:50.358 --> 01:07:53.485
I spent a lot of time on boats
as a kid and I used to love it.

1040
01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:56.112
but not anymore.

1041
01:07:57.365 --> 01:08:00.700
Okay. I'll stay.

1042
01:08:00.827 --> 01:08:03.495
-You are an angel.

1043
01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:05.363
I'll need some more wine.
though.

1044
01:08:05.457 --> 01:08:07.207
-Please?
-Yes. ma'am.

1045
01:08:40.033 --> 01:08:41.658
Hey. Captain Spinks.

1046
01:08:41.743 --> 01:08:43.201
-How you doin'?
-Jesse.

1047
01:08:43.286 --> 01:08:44.994
Hey. I'm surprised
to see you here today.

1048
01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:47.071
Last I heard. you and your wife
were about to get a--

1049
01:08:47.165 --> 01:08:49.240
Yeah. we're getting a divorce.
We are. we are.

1050
01:08:49.334 --> 01:08:52.743
I just wanna give these. though.
to my girlfriend. We...

1051
01:08:52.838 --> 01:08:54.745
We just had a little bit
of a misunderstanding.

1052
01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:55.922
Girlfriend?

1053
01:08:58.677 --> 01:09:00.468
Best I can do
is give these to her for you.

1054
01:09:00.554 --> 01:09:02.929
-Which of the ladies?
-Well...

1055
01:09:03.056 --> 01:09:04.389
Her name is Sylvia Stafford.
but I'd really like

1056
01:09:04.474 --> 01:09:06.591
to give 'em to her myself.

1057
01:09:06.685 --> 01:09:08.643
I don't want a scene today.
Jesse.

1058
01:09:14.818 --> 01:09:15.900
Okay.

1059
01:09:55.442 --> 01:09:58.651
-Oh! Moring.
-Oh. Good morning.

1060
01:09:59.321 --> 01:10:01.196
Oh!

1061
01:10:01.281 --> 01:10:03.573
-This is for you.
-Thank you.

1062
01:10:03.658 --> 01:10:05.992
-Would you like some coffee?
-Yes. please.

1063
01:10:06.995 --> 01:10:08.319
Oh.

1064
01:10:08.413 --> 01:10:11.539
Mm-hmm. Oh. yes. thank you.

1065
01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:17.170
-You okay?
-Hm.

1066
01:10:17.297 --> 01:10:20.831
Jesse sent me a text.
He wants to see me tonight.

1067
01:10:20.926 --> 01:10:23.092
He wants to make things right.

1068
01:10:23.178 --> 01:10:25.970
Mm. Well.
he doesn't give up easy.

1069
01:10:26.056 --> 01:10:27.672
He was pretty freaked out
when he found out

1070
01:10:27.766 --> 01:10:30.183
you were getting your lawyers
involved.

1071
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:32.936
Just ignore him. okay?

1072
01:10:33.021 --> 01:10:37.515
-You're right. Mm.
-Is that it?

1073
01:10:37.609 --> 01:10:40.017
Did you get a message from
the boat's captain this morning?

1074
01:10:40.111 --> 01:10:43.488
Captain Spinks? No.
My phone died. What'd he say?

1075
01:10:43.573 --> 01:10:46.199
They pushed up the
launch because of the weather.

1076
01:10:46.326 --> 01:10:49.285
Um. they want us back
before it gets too rough.

1077
01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:57.368
Are you sure
you're okay?

1078
01:10:57.462 --> 01:10:59.254
Not really.
I was already nervous.

1079
01:10:59.339 --> 01:11:01.923
and. uh. now there's a chance
of bad weather.

1080
01:11:02.008 --> 01:11:04.884
So? What?

1081
01:11:05.011 --> 01:11:07.512
I have
too many bad memories.

1082
01:11:09.849 --> 01:11:12.883
My mother died on a boat
when I was a kid.

1083
01:11:12.978 --> 01:11:17.054
Oh. my gosh.
I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

1084
01:11:17.148 --> 01:11:21.776
This'll be the first time
I've been on a boat since then.

1085
01:11:21.861 --> 01:11:25.363
Well. I'll be right there
with you today. okay?

1086
01:11:27.117 --> 01:11:29.075
I really appreciate it.

1087
01:11:29.202 --> 01:11:32.245
I got you. You're gonna be okay.

1088
01:11:38.545 --> 01:11:39.919
Hello?

1089
01:11:40.839 --> 01:11:42.213
Ladies?

1090
01:11:43.842 --> 01:11:46.926
Captain Spinks? Huh.

1091
01:11:47.053 --> 01:11:48.803
-You good?
-Yeah.

1092
01:11:53.184 --> 01:11:55.059
Are you sure
you got the time right?

1093
01:11:55.145 --> 01:11:57.928
Captain Spinks usually meets us
with champagne as we board.

1094
01:11:58.023 --> 01:12:00.315
I think so.
Should we call Elizabeth?

1095
01:12:01.818 --> 01:12:03.318
Hello?

1096
01:12:05.947 --> 01:12:09.282
Maybe they rescheduled.
somewhere on land.

1097
01:12:09.409 --> 01:12:11.951
Or maybe
they're just downstairs.

1098
01:12:12.078 --> 01:12:13.778
Listen. I know you're nervous.

1099
01:12:13.872 --> 01:12:16.447
but you are gonna have
a great time.

1100
01:12:16.541 --> 01:12:19.709
-Okay? Yeah?
-Okay. Mm. Yeah.

1101
01:12:22.422 --> 01:12:24.714
You're gonna be okay?

1102
01:12:24.799 --> 01:12:26.758
I'm sorry. I think I may need
to lie down for a minute.

1103
01:12:26.843 --> 01:12:29.635
Of course. Don't apologize.
okay? Follow me.

1104
01:12:30.555 --> 01:12:32.263
Slowly.

1105
01:12:34.142 --> 01:12:35.224
Careful.

1106
01:12:36.853 --> 01:12:39.312
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-Breathe. It's okay.

1107
01:12:50.158 --> 01:12:52.575
All right. here you go.

1108
01:12:54.454 --> 01:12:55.912
Bathroom's right in there. okay?

1109
01:12:55.997 --> 01:12:58.664
-Um. thank you. I appreciate it.
-Of course.

1110
01:12:58.792 --> 01:13:01.492
Just don't hibernate in here
too long. okay?

1111
01:13:01.586 --> 01:13:03.795
-Deal.
-I'll get the champagne ready.

1112
01:13:27.612 --> 01:13:29.987
Vanessa? Are you okay?

1113
01:13:31.950 --> 01:13:34.617
Hello? Let me out!

1114
01:13:34.702 --> 01:13:36.160
Open this door!

1115
01:13:41.167 --> 01:13:45.369
Jesse. Jesse. Jesse.
Are you okay?

1116
01:13:45.463 --> 01:13:47.130
Hang on. Jesse. I'll get help.

1117
01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:10.862
Okay.

1118
01:14:15.326 --> 01:14:17.368
Come on.

1119
01:14:17.454 --> 01:14:18.619
Come on.

1120
01:14:21.291 --> 01:14:23.916
Come on. Please.

1121
01:14:24.043 --> 01:14:25.543
Please. please. please. Come on.

1122
01:14:40.185 --> 01:14:41.392
Sylvia.

1123
01:14:48.193 --> 01:14:49.192
Sylvia.

1124
01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:51.769
Are you okay?

1125
01:14:51.863 --> 01:14:53.154
Get my phone.
it's under the couch.

1126
01:14:53.239 --> 01:14:55.615
There's no service here.

1127
01:14:55.742 --> 01:14:57.033
He's coming.

1128
01:15:12.884 --> 01:15:15.793
Well. you look snug as a bug
in a rug.

1129
01:15:15.887 --> 01:15:17.461
Well. we're just about
to. uh. depart.

1130
01:15:17.555 --> 01:15:19.764
so I'm gonna go
let our other passenger know.

1131
01:15:19.849 --> 01:15:23.559
She is gonna be so surprised
to see daddy.

1132
01:15:31.694 --> 01:15:33.528
He's your father?

1133
01:15:33.613 --> 01:15:35.404
Long story. I'll be right back.

1134
01:15:35.490 --> 01:15:37.198
Please be careful.

1135
01:15:57.262 --> 01:15:59.011
Now. where did you go?

1136
01:16:01.599 --> 01:16:03.182
Well. at least
you're still there.

1137
01:16:03.309 --> 01:16:05.676
Now. where's she hidin'?

1138
01:16:05.770 --> 01:16:08.729
Not gonna tell me?
It's all right.

1139
01:16:08.815 --> 01:16:10.398
I'll find her myself.

1140
01:16:12.735 --> 01:16:15.152
Sylvia!

1141
01:16:20.493 --> 01:16:21.867
-Did you call for help?
-I couldn't.

1142
01:16:21.995 --> 01:16:23.953
-He smashed the radio.
-Hand me my phone.

1143
01:16:24.038 --> 01:16:25.621
Check for reception up here.

1144
01:16:25.707 --> 01:16:28.374
Sylvia. watch out! Sylvia!

1145
01:16:47.979 --> 01:16:49.979
Oh. We're moving.

1146
01:16:51.482 --> 01:16:53.691
-Ah. you're awake.
-Oh.

1147
01:16:53.776 --> 01:16:54.942
I was afraid you were gonna
sleep through

1148
01:16:55.028 --> 01:16:56.060
our whole father-daughter trip.

1149
01:16:56.154 --> 01:16:57.653
Dad. what is this all about?

1150
01:16:57.739 --> 01:16:59.229
This is about me reclaiming

1151
01:16:59.324 --> 01:17:01.157
my place in rightful society.

1152
01:17:01.242 --> 01:17:02.950
-I don't understand.
-Oh. sweetheart.

1153
01:17:03.036 --> 01:17:05.369
You don't have to understand.
all you have to do is just

1154
01:17:05.455 --> 01:17:07.955
enjoy the fireworks
at the end of the celebration.

1155
01:17:11.836 --> 01:17:14.587
Dad. please. dad.

1156
01:17:14.714 --> 01:17:15.838
Dad.

1157
01:17:18.176 --> 01:17:21.093
You know. after your little
prank yesterday in the park.

1158
01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:24.138
I realized
that you figured it out somehow.

1159
01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:27.683
I'm not your dad.

1160
01:17:27.769 --> 01:17:30.811
So it's true then.
Who's my father?

1161
01:17:33.316 --> 01:17:36.651
He was a loser.
He ran out on you mother.

1162
01:17:36.736 --> 01:17:40.446
And I agreed to raise you if she
could just leave him behind.

1163
01:17:41.532 --> 01:17:42.940
She just couldn't forget him.

1164
01:17:43.034 --> 01:17:44.942
She was gonna tell you
everything.

1165
01:17:45.036 --> 01:17:46.777
I couldn't let that happen.

1166
01:17:46.871 --> 01:17:50.614
I'd already lost everything.
I lost my career.

1167
01:17:50.708 --> 01:17:54.710
I lost my dignity.
my self-respect.

1168
01:17:54.796 --> 01:17:56.462
I raised his little brat.
and he was

1169
01:17:56.589 --> 01:17:57.788
coming back to take your mother?

1170
01:17:57.882 --> 01:17:58.756
What are you talking about?

1171
01:17:58.841 --> 01:17:59.965
Your dad decided

1172
01:18:00.093 --> 01:18:01.792
he finally wanted to meet you.

1173
01:18:01.886 --> 01:18:03.886
after all those years.

1174
01:18:03.971 --> 01:18:06.430
But I knew what he was
really after. I knew.

1175
01:18:06.516 --> 01:18:09.809
So I tricked him. I got him to
go out on the boat. I told him.

1176
01:18:09.936 --> 01:18:12.103
I told him
we needed to talk things out.

1177
01:18:13.564 --> 01:18:17.141
And then... I pushed him over

1178
01:18:17.235 --> 01:18:20.144
right before I sank the boat.

1179
01:18:20.238 --> 01:18:22.405
You know.
they never found his body.

1180
01:18:23.741 --> 01:18:25.816
Your mother. she. uh.

1181
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:27.076
she must have tried
to swim to shore.

1182
01:18:27.161 --> 01:18:29.537
-I knew it was you!
-I loved her!

1183
01:18:29.622 --> 01:18:31.497
This is why you kicked me out.
I'd always thought

1184
01:18:31.624 --> 01:18:32.823
it was because
of the insurance money.

1185
01:18:32.917 --> 01:18:35.960
Insurance money? Are you...

1186
01:18:36.045 --> 01:18:39.163
Your mother took out loans
for your dreams.

1187
01:18:39.257 --> 01:18:41.498
What about my dreams?

1188
01:18:41.592 --> 01:18:43.342
I could've made my mark
in this world.

1189
01:18:43.469 --> 01:18:45.836
I could've.
I could've been somebody.

1190
01:18:45.930 --> 01:18:48.338
And instead.
I was reduced to cheating.

1191
01:18:48.433 --> 01:18:50.850
stealing. just to scrape by.

1192
01:18:52.270 --> 01:18:53.677
That's where
I met your friend Becca.

1193
01:18:53.771 --> 01:18:55.771
What does this have to do
with Becca?

1194
01:18:58.735 --> 01:19:00.651
Yeah. see. I met. uh...

1195
01:19:01.904 --> 01:19:04.071
I met Becca in Vegas...

1196
01:19:06.451 --> 01:19:08.701
and I figured. well.

1197
01:19:08.828 --> 01:19:12.121
sooner or later
she's gonna remember me.

1198
01:19:12.206 --> 01:19:14.364
So. uh...

1199
01:19:14.459 --> 01:19:16.700
-I just made it sooner.
-Stop. stop.

1200
01:19:16.794 --> 01:19:18.368
You took everything from me.

1201
01:19:18.463 --> 01:19:20.871
You wouldn't be anything
without me.

1202
01:19:20.965 --> 01:19:23.132
And today's the day
that you're gonna pay.

1203
01:19:23.217 --> 01:19:24.717
What the hell are you doing?

1204
01:19:24.844 --> 01:19:26.376
-You won't get away with this.
-Put that down!

1205
01:19:26.471 --> 01:19:27.762
The entire FIL knows
what you've done!

1206
01:19:31.434 --> 01:19:36.353
Sylvie. Sylvie. Sylvie.
come on. Put that thing down.

1207
01:19:36.439 --> 01:19:40.057
You don't have the guts
to kill me. It's not in you.

1208
01:19:40.151 --> 01:19:42.943
You're not a killer.
You make jewelry.

1209
01:19:51.954 --> 01:19:53.204
Earl!

1210
01:20:02.507 --> 01:20:04.256
Sylvia. be careful.

1211
01:20:07.637 --> 01:20:10.087
Captain Spinks
is not answering my calls.

1212
01:20:10.181 --> 01:20:11.764
I spoke to him last night.

1213
01:20:11.891 --> 01:20:13.974
He assured me
everything was in order.

1214
01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:17.094
Should I call and let everyone
know the trip is canceled?

1215
01:20:17.188 --> 01:20:21.440
Yes. it's pretty clear
we're not going anywhere today.

1216
01:20:25.029 --> 01:20:26.737
-Hey. -Today's the day that you're...

1217
01:20:26.823 --> 01:20:29.606
Are you... Sylvia
and Vanessa are in danger?

1218
01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:32.776
-You know. Sylvia--
-Earl. it's time to stop!

1219
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:34.778
You just made me realize
you're not gonna ride off

1220
01:20:34.872 --> 01:20:37.164
into the sunset without me.

1221
01:20:37.250 --> 01:20:39.750
Tell you what. let's just watch
the fireworks together.

1222
01:20:39.836 --> 01:20:42.419
-What do you say?
-Stop.

1223
01:20:42.505 --> 01:20:44.547
What a lovely way to die!

1224
01:21:08.197 --> 01:21:09.613
Earl!

1225
01:21:32.388 --> 01:21:33.470
Dad...

1226
01:21:38.644 --> 01:21:41.061
I just can't stop looking at it.

1227
01:21:42.690 --> 01:21:44.940
Corey did a beautiful job.

1228
01:21:45.026 --> 01:21:47.943
I really think he's gonna go far
as a jewelry designer.

1229
01:21:48.029 --> 01:21:50.613
I can't wait to show Luke.

1230
01:21:50.698 --> 01:21:53.023
Was Corey surprised
about the promotion?

1231
01:21:53.117 --> 01:21:55.868
Yes. and I'm surprised
by how much I'm enjoying

1232
01:21:55.995 --> 01:21:59.788
the extra time
with you and the FIL.

1233
01:22:00.458 --> 01:22:01.874
And Noah.

1234
01:22:03.502 --> 01:22:07.338
-I'm seeing him again tonight.
-Huh?

1235
01:22:07.423 --> 01:22:09.206
Do you have anything
you wanna say to me?

1236
01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:12.376
You were right. Claire.
He's perfect for me.

1237
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:16.347
-And you knew it all along.
-Oh. Come here.

1238
01:22:17.892 --> 01:22:19.016
Mm...

1239
01:22:23.105 --> 01:22:24.188
Mm...

1240
01:22:26.859 --> 01:22:31.111
-Can you believe it?
-Ah. it's a dream come true.

1241
01:22:31.197 --> 01:22:33.781
All the members are loving
Lush Designs' fabulous new app.

1242
01:22:33.866 --> 01:22:36.900
Thankfully.
with Jesse behind bars.

1243
01:22:36.994 --> 01:22:40.704
it was a simple task to get all
of the members complete access

1244
01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:43.407
to the most talented
jewelry designer I know.

1245
01:22:43.501 --> 01:22:44.908
I bet all the members
will be wearing

1246
01:22:45.002 --> 01:22:46.877
your designs
at the next meeting.

1247
01:22:46.963 --> 01:22:49.755
Well. I can't think of a better
place to debut the app than here

1248
01:22:49.882 --> 01:22:51.590
where our partnership started.

1249
01:22:51.717 --> 01:22:56.512
It was a wonderful gesture
to donate tonight's proceeds

1250
01:22:56.597 --> 01:23:00.090
to the Becca Brown Design Studio
for Teens.

1251
01:23:00.184 --> 01:23:02.592
Becca would've loved that.
To Becca.

1252
01:23:02.687 --> 01:23:04.395
-Yes.

1253
01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:09.274
Hey. I hear
someone has a blind date later.

1254
01:23:11.362 --> 01:23:15.772
Well. it worked out so well
for Sylvia. so...

1255
01:23:15.866 --> 01:23:17.324
To lasting friendships

1256
01:23:17.410 --> 01:23:21.328
and powerful women
who help each other.

1257
01:23:21.414 --> 01:23:23.280
-Cheers to that.
-All right. bring it in.

1258
01:23:23.374 --> 01:23:26.208
Bring it in. bring it in.
Come here.
