3
00:02:08.563 --> 00:02:09.955
Thank you.

4
00:02:18.921 --> 00:02:20.270
Miranda.

5
00:02:24.231 --> 00:02:26.015
- Miranda!
- Mm.

6
00:02:27.103 --> 00:02:28.800
Oh. sorry. Annette.

7
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.629
It's just--
it's the new Christie book.

8
00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.414
Aren't you
supposed to be at work?

9
00:02:33.414 --> 00:02:34.763
I would not
make it through the day

10
00:02:34.763 --> 00:02:36.199
if it were not
for this book.

11
00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:38.070
Oh. nonsense.

12
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.335
You have a job. you don't live
in a boarding house.

13
00:02:41.335 --> 00:02:43.032
Well. you've done
quite well for yourself.

14
00:02:43.032 --> 00:02:44.381
Oh. so. that's it then?

15
00:02:44.381 --> 00:02:46.078
At least you're
surrounded by stories.

16
00:02:46.078 --> 00:02:47.645
I'm surrounded by plants.

17
00:02:48.255 --> 00:02:50.300
Flowers. Miranda.

18
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.694
You're surrounded by flowers.

19
00:02:52.694 --> 00:02:55.523
I mean. you spend your days
surrounded by beauty

20
00:02:55.523 --> 00:02:59.266
and all you can think about
are your morbid little stories.

21
00:02:59.266 --> 00:03:00.876
Little stories?

22
00:03:00.876 --> 00:03:02.573
Would that we could
live a life

23
00:03:02.573 --> 00:03:04.967
a quarter
as Inspector Poirot.

24
00:03:04.967 --> 00:03:07.796
Solving cases.
uncovering plots.

25
00:03:07.796 --> 00:03:09.841
finding truth
in all of the lies.

26
00:03:09.841 --> 00:03:12.670
Creating order
out of the chaos.

27
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.716
These are not little stories.

28
00:03:14.716 --> 00:03:17.284
Oh. speaking of. were you able
to find any more criminal--

29
00:03:17.284 --> 00:03:20.417
- It's from 1907. but--
- Annette!

30
00:03:20.417 --> 00:03:22.550
You're so wonderful.
Thank you.

31
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.770
- Of course.
- Oh. Oh.

32
00:03:32.516 --> 00:03:33.952
- Miranda.
- Hmm?

33
00:03:33.952 --> 00:03:35.519
Shouldn't you
be getting to work?

34
00:03:43.048 --> 00:03:45.834
Every contact leaves a trace.

35
00:03:47.314 --> 00:03:48.315
Oh.

36
00:04:21.913 --> 00:04:24.176
Oh. oh. dear! Oh. my!

37
00:04:24.176 --> 00:04:26.744
- Let me help you.
- Thank you. Miranda. dear.

38
00:04:27.658 --> 00:04:29.617
I passed three others

39
00:04:29.617 --> 00:04:32.576
and you were my only tenant
to offer a hand.

40
00:04:32.576 --> 00:04:34.448
Oh. I'm sure
they just didn't notice.

41
00:04:34.448 --> 00:04:37.320
Well. that's what
I like about you. dear.

42
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.714
You are always paying attention.

43
00:04:39.714 --> 00:04:41.716
Good evening. Mrs. Cavendish.

44
00:04:41.716 --> 00:04:44.588
Oh. I almost forgot.

45
00:04:44.588 --> 00:04:46.286
A man dropped this off today.

46
00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:47.678
Did he say who it was from?

47
00:04:47.678 --> 00:04:50.768
No. but he didn't seem
the courier type

48
00:04:50.768 --> 00:04:52.944
by the looks
of his suit jacket.

49
00:04:52.944 --> 00:04:57.297
Perhaps.
he's a gentleman caller.

50
00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:59.255
Oh. one would have
to meet gentlemen

51
00:04:59.255 --> 00:05:00.735
for them to come calling.

52
00:05:01.823 --> 00:05:04.086
Well. good night.

53
00:05:18.187 --> 00:05:22.974
"Miss Green. you have been
cordially invited
to Abbott Island

54
00:05:22.974 --> 00:05:28.719
for an audience
with Mr. Lewis Findley
over the upcoming weekend.

55
00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:32.810
All will be explained onsite.
please pack accordingly.

56
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.336
<i>You may find your travel
accommodations enclosed."</i>

57
00:05:38.381 --> 00:05:40.035
Where's the return trip?

58
00:05:40.035 --> 00:05:41.689
<i>"Few concrete facts</i>

59
00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:44.300
<i>are known about
the English textile magnate</i>

60
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.217
<i>outside of his extreme wealth.
estimated in the billions.</i>

61
00:05:49.087 --> 00:05:52.656
<i>The rest is hearsay
and speculation."</i>

62
00:05:58.923 --> 00:06:00.229
Well?

63
00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:02.405
I think
it's a strange proposition

64
00:06:02.405 --> 00:06:03.580
and you should take heed.

65
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.277
You've no sense of adventure.

66
00:06:05.277 --> 00:06:08.237
Adventure?
I'm all for adventure.

67
00:06:08.237 --> 00:06:10.195
But. Miranda.
I know you better than this.

68
00:06:10.195 --> 00:06:13.634
You're careful. pragmatic.
and most of all. smart.

69
00:06:13.634 --> 00:06:16.637
And smart girls
don't run off to islands.

70
00:06:16.637 --> 00:06:18.769
because they received
an unmarked letter.

71
00:06:18.769 --> 00:06:20.292
It has Findley's seal.

72
00:06:20.292 --> 00:06:22.033
You said yourself
the seal is different.

73
00:06:22.033 --> 00:06:24.035
Well. I'm currently working
on a theory about that.

74
00:06:24.035 --> 00:06:25.994
Miranda. be reasonable.

75
00:06:25.994 --> 00:06:29.389
You're not Scotland Yard.
you're a florist.

76
00:06:30.564 --> 00:06:32.043
What would your mother say?

77
00:06:32.043 --> 00:06:34.002
You're being robbed.

78
00:06:34.785 --> 00:06:36.221
What? That makes no sense.

79
00:06:36.221 --> 00:06:38.746
Sir. you can take the books
out of your pockets now.

80
00:06:38.746 --> 00:06:40.182
I beg your pardon?

81
00:06:40.182 --> 00:06:42.358
There were 46 books
on the rear bookshelf.

82
00:06:42.358 --> 00:06:43.707
there's currently 44.

83
00:06:53.195 --> 00:06:54.762
She would say it'd be safe.

84
00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:22.485
Ah. here for Findley.
I suppose?

85
00:07:22.485 --> 00:07:25.923
Well. allow me
to introduce everyone.

86
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.971
This is Miss Lu Wang.

87
00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:34.323
Not much of a talker that one.

88
00:07:34.323 --> 00:07:36.325
Then these chatterboxes

89
00:07:36.325 --> 00:07:38.936
are Phillip Armstrong. doctor.

90
00:07:38.936 --> 00:07:41.069
and make no mistake.
he will remind you.

91
00:07:41.069 --> 00:07:43.680
Well. my mother is very proud.
as is my uncle.

92
00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.857
- who is one of the top--
- Yes. fascinating.

93
00:07:46.857 --> 00:07:51.253
And then we have--
Ah. I'm terribly sorry. dear.

94
00:07:51.253 --> 00:07:53.255
I've already forgotten
your name.

95
00:07:53.255 --> 00:07:55.692
My name is Carmen Blanco.

96
00:07:55.692 --> 00:07:57.215
Pleased to meet you.

97
00:07:58.782 --> 00:07:59.957
And what about him?

98
00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:04.527
That is Donald Walker.

99
00:08:04.527 --> 00:08:07.225
an American journalist.

100
00:08:07.225 --> 00:08:10.446
Best to steer clear of that one.
He's a bit of a--

101
00:08:10.446 --> 00:08:11.491
Watch it. Kane.

102
00:08:12.579 --> 00:08:15.320
Yes. well...

103
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.019
Lawrence Kane
at your service.

104
00:08:18.019 --> 00:08:19.760
Barrister by trade.

105
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.676
London's foremost man
about town by reputation.

106
00:08:22.676 --> 00:08:25.287
Miranda Green. Florist.

107
00:08:25.287 --> 00:08:28.333
Ah. Miranda Green. florist.

108
00:08:28.333 --> 00:08:33.034
Welcome to our little party.

109
00:08:38.561 --> 00:08:40.520
They're all the same.

110
00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:44.915
Myself and those two
already checked.

111
00:08:48.136 --> 00:08:49.180
Hmm.

112
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.096
And no one's met Findley?

113
00:08:52.096 --> 00:08:56.231
No. No connections at all.

114
00:08:56.231 --> 00:08:57.580
There shouldn't be six.

115
00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.147
I beg your pardon.

116
00:08:59.147 --> 00:09:01.845
There should only be five people
on this train.

117
00:09:01.845 --> 00:09:04.456
Ah. I. uh. I don't follow.

118
00:09:04.456 --> 00:09:07.068
There are five leaves
on the seal
which shouldn't be there.

119
00:09:07.068 --> 00:09:09.331
They don't appear
on Findley's seal anywhere else.

120
00:09:09.331 --> 00:09:11.420
It must have something to do
with the invitation.

121
00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.727
those invited.
but it doesn't make sense.

122
00:09:13.727 --> 00:09:16.381
There are five leaves
and six people.

123
00:09:20.777 --> 00:09:23.693
I'm sure
it's just a coincidence.

124
00:09:23.693 --> 00:09:25.608
I suppose it could be.

125
00:09:50.677 --> 00:09:51.721
Good afternoon. everyone.

126
00:09:51.721 --> 00:09:53.984
My name is Gordon.
Lord Findley's valet.

127
00:09:53.984 --> 00:09:55.595
If you can please make your way
to one of the cars.

128
00:09:55.595 --> 00:09:57.248
- we're a bit behind schedule.
- Could you please tell us--

129
00:09:57.248 --> 00:10:00.077
All will be explained
in due time. Mr. Armstrong.

130
00:10:00.077 --> 00:10:01.731
Now. if you'll
please make haste.

131
00:10:01.731 --> 00:10:03.690
Weather conditions have made
the trip to the island--

132
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:05.561
Precarious.

133
00:10:05.561 --> 00:10:08.085
It's all a bit precarious.
ain't it?

134
00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:23.726
Right.

135
00:11:23.726 --> 00:11:26.033
Allow me to introduce Sean.
the house butler.

136
00:11:26.033 --> 00:11:27.599
and Katherine. our maid.

137
00:11:27.599 --> 00:11:30.254
They'll be at your service
for the duration of your stay.

138
00:11:30.254 --> 00:11:32.822
That's it?
Findley couldn't afford
more help?

139
00:11:34.171 --> 00:11:37.697
Lord Findley
prefers a more intimate

140
00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:39.046
staffing arrangement. sir.

141
00:11:40.438 --> 00:11:43.659
Yeah. sure he does.

142
00:11:44.616 --> 00:11:46.575
Excuse me.
where is Mr. Findley?

143
00:11:46.575 --> 00:11:48.533
- Uh. master--
- Lord Findley's plane

144
00:11:48.533 --> 00:11:50.535
was grounded by fog.

145
00:11:50.535 --> 00:11:53.887
There's an approaching storm
and he will be
joining us tomorrow.

146
00:11:53.887 --> 00:11:55.540
That doesn't leave us
much time.

147
00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:58.761
I took off almost
a week of work to be here.

148
00:11:58.761 --> 00:12:01.982
Forget almost.
I was on a story in Valdosta.

149
00:12:01.982 --> 00:12:05.550
You know how long it takes
to get from Georgia.
to New York. to here?

150
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:06.638
Of course you don't.

151
00:12:06.638 --> 00:12:08.553
Well. five hours by rail
to Atlanta

152
00:12:08.553 --> 00:12:10.555
and five hours by plane
to New York.

153
00:12:10.555 --> 00:12:12.514
Yeah. okay. Alright.

154
00:12:12.514 --> 00:12:15.560
You will have
the appropriate audience
with Lord Findley. my dear.

155
00:12:16.474 --> 00:12:18.128
I can assure you of that.

156
00:12:18.128 --> 00:12:21.653
Well. if you'll allow me
to show you to your quarters.

157
00:12:21.653 --> 00:12:25.701
Uh. Sean and Katherine
will bring your belongings shortly.

158
00:12:25.701 --> 00:12:28.791
Quarters. I've never
stayed in quarters before.

159
00:12:28.791 --> 00:12:30.227
It's a room.

160
00:12:30.227 --> 00:12:31.838
Welcome. my dear.

161
00:12:33.056 --> 00:12:34.710
Lord Findley has instructed us

162
00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:37.278
to proceed with
the weekend as planned.

163
00:12:37.278 --> 00:12:40.020
As such. there will be
cocktails in the lounge.

164
00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.586
once you've settled in.

165
00:12:43.414 --> 00:12:45.939
Welcome to the east wing.

166
00:12:45.939 --> 00:12:48.376
If you'll follow me
to your individual quarters.

167
00:12:48.376 --> 00:12:51.422
the east wing houses
Lord Findley's guests.

168
00:12:51.422 --> 00:12:52.772
Mr. Walker.

169
00:12:55.687 --> 00:12:58.168
I think you'll find
your accommodations--

170
00:13:00.867 --> 00:13:03.913
Ms. Blanco. Ms. Wang.
and Mr. Armstrong.

171
00:13:11.529 --> 00:13:14.576
I think you'll find
your accommodations
more than satisfactory.

172
00:13:15.882 --> 00:13:17.579
I think this will suffice.

173
00:13:23.019 --> 00:13:24.673
Follow me.

174
00:13:24.673 --> 00:13:25.717
Oh.

175
00:13:29.591 --> 00:13:32.028
Mr. Kane. Ms. Green.

176
00:13:34.726 --> 00:13:37.642
Oh. uh. promise me
you'll keep it down. dear.

177
00:13:37.642 --> 00:13:39.122
I'm a bit of a light sleeper.

178
00:13:39.122 --> 00:13:41.255
Only if you guarantee the same.

179
00:13:41.255 --> 00:13:42.517
Hm.

180
00:13:43.866 --> 00:13:45.520
Don't fret. Miss Green.

181
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.349
Lord Findley knows
his guests value their privacy.

182
00:13:48.349 --> 00:13:51.482
The rooms
have been soundproofed.

183
00:15:18.308 --> 00:15:19.440
I still find it funny.

184
00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.571
Thank you.

185
00:15:24.271 --> 00:15:26.838
My. my. My. my.

186
00:15:26.838 --> 00:15:30.842
- I had not seen that...
- No. well. I think...

187
00:15:30.842 --> 00:15:34.890
Ah. Miss Green.
what a pleasure it is
to have you join us.

188
00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:36.718
Would you care
for a refreshment?

189
00:15:36.718 --> 00:15:38.894
He makes a splendid Manhattan.

190
00:15:38.894 --> 00:15:43.594
Well. the master
also has a stocked cellar
from his private vineyard.

191
00:15:43.594 --> 00:15:45.553
That would be splendid.

192
00:15:46.554 --> 00:15:50.732
A vintage the master
was particularly fond of.

193
00:15:50.732 --> 00:15:51.820
Was?

194
00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:54.562
Hmm?
Oh. my apologies of course.

195
00:15:54.562 --> 00:15:58.174
No. the master simply had a...
well. a change of taste.

196
00:15:58.174 --> 00:16:00.611
Well. it's certainly better
than what I'm used to.

197
00:16:01.699 --> 00:16:03.701
Not much of a drinker. are you?

198
00:16:03.701 --> 00:16:07.009
I prefer to keep a clear head
in unfamiliar surroundings.

199
00:16:07.009 --> 00:16:09.098
Eh. that's smart.
I got this. thanks.

200
00:16:09.838 --> 00:16:11.274
Oh. Mr. Walker!

201
00:16:11.274 --> 00:16:14.451
What? The old man won't miss it.
Will he?

202
00:16:15.887 --> 00:16:17.150
Of course not. sir.

203
00:16:19.065 --> 00:16:20.022
Hmm.

204
00:16:21.545 --> 00:16:23.199
A toast. shall we?

205
00:16:23.199 --> 00:16:24.940
Since we're all
finally here together.

206
00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.464
What a lovely idea.
Come on. come on. come on.

207
00:16:27.464 --> 00:16:28.988
Gather around.

208
00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:31.381
You too. Walker.
you can brood later.

209
00:16:31.381 --> 00:16:32.992
- Up. up. up.

210
00:16:34.863 --> 00:16:36.517
What shall we toast to?

211
00:16:36.517 --> 00:16:38.562
To our generous host?

212
00:16:38.562 --> 00:16:41.304
To the workers
he used and discarded.

213
00:16:41.304 --> 00:16:44.438
- Oh.
- Why don't we toast
to new friends?

214
00:16:44.438 --> 00:16:48.398
Whatever the reason
and wherever the location.
we're all here together.

215
00:16:48.398 --> 00:16:51.532
In this world.
it's a small miracle.

216
00:16:51.532 --> 00:16:52.576
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

217
00:16:52.576 --> 00:16:53.621
- Cheers.

218
00:16:53.621 --> 00:16:57.146
- Oh.

219
00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:59.496
Terribly sorry.

220
00:16:59.496 --> 00:17:01.281
Oh. bloody hell.

221
00:17:01.281 --> 00:17:02.847
Quite bit of a fight.

222
00:17:02.847 --> 00:17:05.415
Why don't we all get to
know each other a little better?

223
00:17:05.415 --> 00:17:06.721
- Ooh.
- Ah.

224
00:17:06.721 --> 00:17:08.070
Shall we play a game?

225
00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:10.029
A delightful idea.

226
00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:14.076
I assume we all know
how to play
Two Truths and a Lie.

227
00:17:14.076 --> 00:17:15.469
- Nope.
- Oh. God.

228
00:17:15.469 --> 00:17:17.819
Oh. stop it you two.
This is going to be fun.

229
00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:19.516
Mm.
- I shall go first.

230
00:17:20.691 --> 00:17:23.564
- I am from Seville. Spain.
- Mm-hmm.

231
00:17:23.564 --> 00:17:25.696
I am a waitress
at my father's restaurant.

232
00:17:25.696 --> 00:17:27.002
- Hmm.
- Lie.

233
00:17:27.002 --> 00:17:28.177
Huh.

234
00:17:28.177 --> 00:17:30.614
Your bag looked
to be secondhand.

235
00:17:30.614 --> 00:17:35.097
and your coat.
it was a child size.
English in origin.

236
00:17:35.097 --> 00:17:36.664
But if your father
owned a restaurant.

237
00:17:36.664 --> 00:17:38.622
it would stand to reason
you would be able to afford

238
00:17:38.622 --> 00:17:40.102
at least one of the two. so...

239
00:17:40.102 --> 00:17:42.583
That's remarkable.
Is that true?

240
00:17:42.583 --> 00:17:46.978
Yes.
I-I never knew my father.

241
00:17:47.805 --> 00:17:49.111
Oh. Carmen.

242
00:17:50.112 --> 00:17:52.245
Dear.
I'm-I'm so sorry. I didn't--

243
00:17:52.245 --> 00:17:55.465
Hey. it is alright.
Good guess.

244
00:17:55.465 --> 00:17:57.467
Yeah. but it's not a guess.
is it?

245
00:17:57.467 --> 00:18:00.209
How did you do that?

246
00:18:01.167 --> 00:18:02.864
I just pay attention.

247
00:18:03.865 --> 00:18:05.388
I have a good memory.
I suppose.

248
00:18:05.388 --> 00:18:08.174
No. I have a-a good memory.
this is--

249
00:18:08.174 --> 00:18:09.784
this is something else entirely.

250
00:18:09.784 --> 00:18:12.917
Now. this is getting good.
You go. Doc.

251
00:18:12.917 --> 00:18:15.616
- I don't--
- No. No. we're doin' this.

252
00:18:15.616 --> 00:18:17.835
Come on. kid.
two truths one lie. go.

253
00:18:17.835 --> 00:18:22.275
Very well.
Um. I graduated from Oxford.

254
00:18:22.275 --> 00:18:24.059
my father
also graduated from--

255
00:18:24.059 --> 00:18:25.234
Lie.

256
00:18:25.843 --> 00:18:27.845
You don't know
your father either. do you?

257
00:18:29.891 --> 00:18:31.371
He's dead. isn't he?

258
00:18:31.371 --> 00:18:32.807
Come on. how?

259
00:18:33.373 --> 00:18:36.550
Well. his shoes
weren't properly polished.

260
00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:39.640
and on the train.
when he spoke of his family.

261
00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:42.164
he skipped from mother to uncle.
So. it stands to reason--

262
00:18:42.164 --> 00:18:43.948
Stands to reason.

263
00:18:44.732 --> 00:18:46.429
My father passed. too.

264
00:18:46.429 --> 00:18:47.735
if it's any consolation.

265
00:18:49.606 --> 00:18:53.958
It appears we have
our first commonality.

266
00:18:54.394 --> 00:19:00.400
No. my father is alive
and well in Guangzhou.

267
00:19:03.142 --> 00:19:04.621
Um. and you. Lawrence?

268
00:19:05.622 --> 00:19:07.015
Buckinghamshire.

269
00:19:08.408 --> 00:19:09.800
Mr. Walker?

270
00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.367
- I'll play next.
- No. I didn't--

271
00:19:11.367 --> 00:19:13.761
One. I'm a reporter
for <i>The Daily Truth.</i>

272
00:19:13.761 --> 00:19:15.110
Two. my mother's dead.

273
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:17.678
And three.
I've never killed a man before.

274
00:19:17.678 --> 00:19:19.810
Three's the lie.
Game over.

275
00:19:21.943 --> 00:19:24.554
Asking the wrong questions
can get you hurt.

276
00:20:03.637 --> 00:20:08.250
I would suggest
you not wander too far.

277
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:10.121
The house is easy
to get lost in.

278
00:20:10.121 --> 00:20:12.907
Oh. I have an excellent
sense of direction.

279
00:20:12.907 --> 00:20:15.910
but thank you
for your concern. Gordon.

280
00:20:49.944 --> 00:20:54.949
The master's dog. Blunder.
passed some weeks back.

281
00:20:57.386 --> 00:21:00.824
Then why keep the water fresh?

282
00:21:00.824 --> 00:21:05.481
Well. the master
was very fond of his dog.

283
00:21:05.481 --> 00:21:09.746
and I should think
he rather enjoyed the ritual
of tending to him.

284
00:21:11.705 --> 00:21:13.750
Now. if you'll follow me. please.

285
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:15.099
Dinner will be served shortly.

286
00:21:15.099 --> 00:21:16.187
Oh. I can make my own--

287
00:21:16.187 --> 00:21:19.930
I must insist.
Miss Green. hmm?

288
00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:21.671
This is not your house.

289
00:21:33.466 --> 00:21:35.598
Oh. my!

290
00:21:35.598 --> 00:21:37.948
This must be
the old man's study.

291
00:21:46.696 --> 00:21:47.697
Adams.

292
00:21:49.395 --> 00:21:51.353
My name is Armstrong.

293
00:21:51.353 --> 00:21:54.269
Do not correct me. Adams.

294
00:21:54.269 --> 00:21:59.187
I am your boss. Lewis Findley!

295
00:22:00.754 --> 00:22:02.930
Yes. sir.

296
00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:07.848
I want you to buy me Seville.

297
00:22:07.848 --> 00:22:09.371
The whole city?

298
00:22:09.371 --> 00:22:11.025
The whole city!

299
00:22:11.025 --> 00:22:13.897
Very well. Done and done.

300
00:22:13.897 --> 00:22:16.378
And what should we do
with your new city. sir?

301
00:22:18.815 --> 00:22:20.513
Burn it to the ground.

302
00:22:22.123 --> 00:22:25.300
It is a place
where dreams go to die.

303
00:22:31.785 --> 00:22:35.963
Perhaps... there is something
else to be done.

304
00:22:37.573 --> 00:22:40.837
Because I know of a girl
who lives there.

305
00:22:40.837 --> 00:22:45.146
who is beautiful and kind.

306
00:22:47.061 --> 00:22:49.846
Maybe we can give her the city.

307
00:22:50.847 --> 00:22:53.981
so she can care for its people
in the manner they deserve.

308
00:23:02.946 --> 00:23:04.078
Hmm.

309
00:23:07.429 --> 00:23:09.562
- Oh. my Lord.
- Mm.

310
00:23:09.562 --> 00:23:10.867
Look at that.

311
00:23:12.391 --> 00:23:14.393
It's beautiful.

312
00:23:14.393 --> 00:23:16.873
It's. uh.
it's called a "katar."

313
00:23:16.873 --> 00:23:18.658
- Hmm.
- It's an ancient Tamil weapon.

314
00:23:19.746 --> 00:23:21.051
Hmm.

315
00:23:22.226 --> 00:23:23.880
Stunning. isn't it?

316
00:23:24.838 --> 00:23:25.926
Yes.

317
00:23:31.627 --> 00:23:33.194
Uh. right.

318
00:23:33.194 --> 00:23:34.630
After you. sir.

319
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:36.676
Oh. why. thank you.

320
00:23:36.676 --> 00:23:40.723
The man shows up
at his hearing with one shoe.

321
00:23:40.723 --> 00:23:42.812
Well. I-I take one look at him
and I realize

322
00:23:42.812 --> 00:23:46.250
that this is an opportunity
to get the case thrown out.

323
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:50.472
So. I tell the judge.
"Take a look at his feet."

324
00:23:50.472 --> 00:23:51.821
- I-I--

325
00:23:51.821 --> 00:23:54.607
You know. I literally hold
the man's foot up--

326
00:23:57.479 --> 00:23:59.481
- Shoe up and put--
- Come on. offer him water.

327
00:23:59.481 --> 00:24:02.919
- Oh!

328
00:24:05.356 --> 00:24:07.446
Oh. my goodness.
I'm terribly sorry. sir!

329
00:24:08.621 --> 00:24:09.796
Oh...

330
00:24:09.796 --> 00:24:13.147
It's. uh...
quite all right. dear.

331
00:24:13.147 --> 00:24:15.149
- Now. um. where was I?

332
00:24:15.149 --> 00:24:16.759
Uh. Katherine was it?

333
00:24:16.759 --> 00:24:18.544
Would you care to tell us
a bit about yourself?

334
00:24:18.544 --> 00:24:21.198
No...
- Or your time
working for Mr. Findley?

335
00:24:21.198 --> 00:24:22.286
Oh. thank Christ.

336
00:24:22.286 --> 00:24:25.376
Um... um...

337
00:24:28.075 --> 00:24:29.685
Oh. well. they can share. too.

338
00:24:29.685 --> 00:24:32.862
What a wonderful idea.
Please share. Katherine.

339
00:24:32.862 --> 00:24:35.691
Yeah. Katherine. share.

340
00:24:35.691 --> 00:24:39.521
I wanna hear how
he treats his people.

341
00:24:39.521 --> 00:24:42.437
Hopefully better
than you treated this pork loin.

342
00:24:44.874 --> 00:24:50.140
Mister-- Lord Findley
is kind to us.

343
00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:52.055
He treats us like family.

344
00:25:12.249 --> 00:25:13.947
Was it something I said?

345
00:25:34.228 --> 00:25:36.665
- Was that you? Screaming?

346
00:25:36.665 --> 00:25:39.799
No. What is going on?

347
00:25:39.799 --> 00:25:41.714
It's probably nothing.

348
00:25:41.714 --> 00:25:43.454
Stay in your room
while I check it out.

349
00:25:54.335 --> 00:25:56.424
What are you doing here?

350
00:25:58.731 --> 00:26:00.471
Same thing as you.

351
00:26:00.471 --> 00:26:02.909
Trying to figure out
what's going on here.

352
00:26:06.303 --> 00:26:11.004
Huh. Gordon. I was setting
for an explanation
for the power loss.

353
00:26:11.004 --> 00:26:13.310
Please. follow me.

354
00:26:25.888 --> 00:26:30.371
Ladies and gentlemen.
there is no cause for alarm.

355
00:26:30.371 --> 00:26:31.764
Well. why did the power go out?

356
00:26:31.764 --> 00:26:34.505
It appears the main switch
was flipped.

357
00:26:34.505 --> 00:26:36.638
but there is no reason
for alarm.

358
00:26:36.638 --> 00:26:39.119
There is no one else
on the island. I assure you.

359
00:26:42.296 --> 00:26:43.602
It was likely an animal.

360
00:26:46.213 --> 00:26:48.432
Regardless. I have fixed it.

361
00:26:48.432 --> 00:26:52.219
so there'll be no more
trouble or incidents tonight.

362
00:26:52.219 --> 00:26:54.308
Now. if you'll please
retire to your rooms.

363
00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:01.271
Hm.

364
00:27:03.883 --> 00:27:05.580
Miss Green. if you please.

365
00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:07.538
Gordon. has there been
any construction

366
00:27:07.538 --> 00:27:09.149
in this hallway recently?

367
00:27:09.149 --> 00:27:11.020
Not that I know of.
why do you ask?

368
00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:13.936
When the power went out.
I heard a woman scream.

369
00:27:13.936 --> 00:27:18.288
Well. your room
is not far from Miss Blanco.

370
00:27:18.288 --> 00:27:19.899
I should think
she had quite a start.

371
00:27:19.899 --> 00:27:22.684
You said the rooms
were soundproof.

372
00:27:22.684 --> 00:27:25.121
I suppose her window was open.

373
00:27:26.427 --> 00:27:27.907
Now. there'll be
no more questions.

374
00:27:27.907 --> 00:27:30.474
Would you please return
to your quarters?

375
00:27:30.474 --> 00:27:33.173
I won't leave the hall.
but I don't feel like
going back in there yet.

376
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:36.742
Very good. miss.

377
00:29:27.548 --> 00:29:29.637
- You. too.
- Good morning.

378
00:29:32.118 --> 00:29:33.380
Good morning.

379
00:29:33.989 --> 00:29:35.208
Ah...

380
00:29:38.472 --> 00:29:41.605
I was about to go for a walk.
it's a lovely day out.

381
00:29:42.563 --> 00:29:43.564
Oh.

382
00:29:56.664 --> 00:29:58.405
Oh. God. yeah.

383
00:29:58.405 --> 00:29:59.885
I was actually just about
to go for a walk.

384
00:29:59.885 --> 00:30:01.756
if you'd care to join me.

385
00:30:03.584 --> 00:30:06.108
Or if you prefer to stay.

386
00:30:06.108 --> 00:30:09.329
Uh. yeah. I'm. uh.

387
00:30:09.329 --> 00:30:11.984
not much
of a breakfast guy.

388
00:30:11.984 --> 00:30:15.204
More of a coffee
and cigarettes for me.

389
00:30:15.204 --> 00:30:18.947
- Can we smoke in here?
- I'm... not sure.

390
00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:23.909
Right. Well. shall we?

391
00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:24.997
Please.

392
00:30:37.574 --> 00:30:38.837
So. what's your deal?

393
00:30:39.925 --> 00:30:42.101
I'm a florist from London.

394
00:30:42.101 --> 00:30:47.846
No. that's what you do.
or at least what
you say you do.

395
00:30:47.846 --> 00:30:49.804
What's your deal?

396
00:30:49.804 --> 00:30:53.547
I've been watchin' you.
You're smart.

397
00:30:53.547 --> 00:30:57.420
Not like that putz doctor.
the real kind.

398
00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.422
I see the things
other people miss.

399
00:30:59.422 --> 00:31:02.425
No. it's more than that.

400
00:31:03.557 --> 00:31:07.300
You put things together
in a way I've never seen before.

401
00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.215
At least not from a civilian.

402
00:31:09.215 --> 00:31:10.956
And yet that's all I am.

403
00:31:10.956 --> 00:31:14.437
Well. why not put your
detective skills to better use?

404
00:31:14.437 --> 00:31:17.484
Oh. it's just not a fitting
profession for a lady.

405
00:31:17.484 --> 00:31:19.878
There's not a place
at Scotland Yard for me.

406
00:31:19.878 --> 00:31:21.531
So. go private.

407
00:31:22.924 --> 00:31:25.927
You know. I knew a lady gumshoe
in California.

408
00:31:25.927 --> 00:31:28.843
She couldn't have been
more than 20 years old.

409
00:31:28.843 --> 00:31:31.759
Pretty little slip
of a thing. too.

410
00:31:31.759 --> 00:31:33.935
She was the best I've ever seen.

411
00:31:33.935 --> 00:31:36.807
I should like to have
your experiences. Mr. Walker.

412
00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:42.509
Trust me. you...
you don't want those.

413
00:31:43.379 --> 00:31:47.818
Speaking of experiences.
is it true you killed a man?

414
00:31:49.864 --> 00:31:54.216
You know. I thought you'd
have gotten to that sooner.

415
00:31:55.478 --> 00:31:57.611
Yeah. it's true.

416
00:31:57.611 --> 00:31:59.874
Look. I'm not proud of it.

417
00:32:00.744 --> 00:32:02.703
What happened?

418
00:32:02.703 --> 00:32:04.444
He was a. uh...

419
00:32:06.228 --> 00:32:10.363
he was a hotshot boxing
promoter out of Boston.

420
00:32:10.363 --> 00:32:14.758
and I was doin' a story
on the Irish mob

421
00:32:14.758 --> 00:32:17.761
and their connections
around the city.

422
00:32:17.761 --> 00:32:18.806
One night...

423
00:32:20.982 --> 00:32:23.724
One night. I see him.
and he's with his wife...

424
00:32:26.248 --> 00:32:29.077
and he starts beatin' on her.
somethin' fierce.

425
00:32:31.471 --> 00:32:34.430
And then he slipped.
hit his head.

426
00:32:37.042 --> 00:32:41.046
Cost me a hell of a story.
he would have killed her.

427
00:32:42.308 --> 00:32:43.831
I remember that story.

428
00:32:44.701 --> 00:32:46.616
Of course you do.

429
00:32:46.616 --> 00:32:50.403
You were let off
because none of the witnesses
would come forward.

430
00:32:50.403 --> 00:32:55.016
Yeah. well. like I said.
he slipped and hit his head.

431
00:32:55.016 --> 00:32:57.192
ten or so times.

432
00:33:01.327 --> 00:33:05.157
I think you're not
the terrifying brute
you try to present.

433
00:33:05.157 --> 00:33:09.552
Still. I would like
to avoid such situations.

434
00:33:09.552 --> 00:33:15.254
Listen. you gotta
get down into the muck
if you wanna find the truth.

435
00:33:15.254 --> 00:33:18.909
You can't have any fear
or limits

436
00:33:18.909 --> 00:33:21.216
to what you'll do
to find your answers.

437
00:33:23.697 --> 00:33:27.222
What I said to you yesterday.
that-that wasn't a threat.

438
00:33:27.222 --> 00:33:28.267
Then what was it?

439
00:33:29.398 --> 00:33:31.966
Call it a
"professional courtesy."

440
00:33:33.228 --> 00:33:36.492
Guys like Findley.
they-they got secrets

441
00:33:36.492 --> 00:33:38.799
they won't hesitate to protect.

442
00:33:38.799 --> 00:33:40.627
You don't care
for our host. do you?

443
00:33:41.802 --> 00:33:43.456
I've never met the man.

444
00:33:43.456 --> 00:33:44.718
Ah. just when I thought

445
00:33:44.718 --> 00:33:47.286
you were starting to show me
a little respect.

446
00:33:47.286 --> 00:33:49.505
You know.
the comments. the rants...

447
00:33:49.505 --> 00:33:51.551
you have an issue
with Lewis Findley

448
00:33:51.551 --> 00:33:53.901
that doesn't even
require his presence.

449
00:33:55.511 --> 00:33:56.991
You caught me.

450
00:33:56.991 --> 00:33:59.080
Then why come?

451
00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:02.040
Same as you.
I-I've got questions.

452
00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:06.218
I think we may not
find many answers.

453
00:34:07.306 --> 00:34:08.611
Maybe not.

454
00:34:10.961 --> 00:34:12.572
But guys like Findley.

455
00:34:12.572 --> 00:34:14.965
they don't do anything
without an angle.

456
00:34:15.792 --> 00:34:18.099
Hopefully. I can at least
figure that out.

457
00:34:18.099 --> 00:34:21.929
I know it has something
to do with us. but...

458
00:34:23.104 --> 00:34:24.062
Yeah.

459
00:34:26.064 --> 00:34:27.326
Me neither.

460
00:34:27.326 --> 00:34:28.544
Hmm.

461
00:34:32.157 --> 00:34:35.029
You know. yesterday.
I didn't mean to--

462
00:34:35.029 --> 00:34:36.117
Look!

463
00:34:52.568 --> 00:34:53.874
What the hell?

464
00:34:55.005 --> 00:34:57.269
There's one extra rabbit.

465
00:34:57.269 --> 00:34:59.706
Jesus. And?

466
00:35:01.969 --> 00:35:03.144
Oh. no. you don't.

467
00:35:03.144 --> 00:35:05.103
No. you're not
doin' that again.

468
00:35:05.103 --> 00:35:06.452
You can't dumb me up now.

469
00:35:06.452 --> 00:35:08.193
You know somethin'.
I wanna hear what it is.

470
00:35:08.193 --> 00:35:10.195
You're gonna tell me.
Where are you going?

471
00:35:10.195 --> 00:35:11.718
Come on!

472
00:35:14.373 --> 00:35:15.939
Unbelievable.

473
00:35:17.202 --> 00:35:20.292
Alright.
what the hell is this?

474
00:35:20.292 --> 00:35:23.164
I think it means there's
someone here who doesn't belong.

475
00:35:23.164 --> 00:35:24.557
Yeah. well. I got my guess.

476
00:35:24.557 --> 00:35:26.298
Oh. she doesn't know anything.

477
00:35:26.298 --> 00:35:27.951
At least I don't think
she does.

478
00:35:27.951 --> 00:35:29.475
Explain that.

479
00:35:29.475 --> 00:35:32.173
Well. she could just as easily
be one of the five.

480
00:35:32.173 --> 00:35:36.786
All this does is confirm
that there's someone here
who's not who they say they are.

481
00:35:36.786 --> 00:35:40.877
It's games on top of games.
on top of games.

482
00:35:40.877 --> 00:35:42.792
And we're going to have
to play them all.

483
00:35:54.935 --> 00:35:56.763
How may I help you.
Mr. Armstrong?

484
00:35:57.938 --> 00:35:59.853
I think you can call me
"Phillip" at this point.

485
00:35:59.853 --> 00:36:02.421
Oh. no.
I am just a poor waitress

486
00:36:02.421 --> 00:36:04.553
and you a successful doctor.

487
00:36:04.553 --> 00:36:07.034
I know my place. Mr. Armstrong.

488
00:36:07.034 --> 00:36:08.818
I'm hardly rich.

489
00:36:08.818 --> 00:36:12.387
Hmm. you belong in this house
more so than I do. no?

490
00:36:12.387 --> 00:36:16.739
Now. chip-chop. what is it
that you are bothering me for?

491
00:36:16.739 --> 00:36:19.655
I was just about
to take a little nap
before lunch.

492
00:36:19.655 --> 00:36:22.223
It's. um. it's "chop-chop."
not "chip-chop."

493
00:36:22.223 --> 00:36:26.140
Ah. so you've come
to insult my English.

494
00:36:38.283 --> 00:36:42.069
Well. if that is all.
I'd like to take my siesta now.

495
00:36:46.116 --> 00:36:47.683
Right.

496
00:36:50.817 --> 00:36:52.514
I think I'll have a walk.

497
00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:55.604
Yes. I'll have a walk.

498
00:37:07.747 --> 00:37:09.575
Alright. trust me.

499
00:37:09.575 --> 00:37:11.054
This is a bit strange.

500
00:37:11.054 --> 00:37:13.361
If he shows up. I'll eat a bug.

501
00:37:14.884 --> 00:37:17.496
Alright. what's going on here?

502
00:37:18.845 --> 00:37:23.719
Last night. you couldn't
get enough to eat or drink.

503
00:37:23.719 --> 00:37:28.681
and now you're sharing secrets
and barely eating. hmm?

504
00:37:29.856 --> 00:37:31.423
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

505
00:37:33.163 --> 00:37:34.774
Lord Findley is still grounded

506
00:37:34.774 --> 00:37:38.256
and weather conditions
have not improved as expected.

507
00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:41.563
As a result.
he will not be joining us today.

508
00:37:41.563 --> 00:37:42.956
Huh!

509
00:37:50.137 --> 00:37:51.791
What the bloody hell
are you doing?

510
00:37:52.487 --> 00:37:54.097
Whatever I want. Larry.

511
00:37:54.924 --> 00:37:57.275
Findley's not here
to stop me. is he?

512
00:37:58.493 --> 00:38:01.104
You're mad. He's mad.

513
00:39:44.599 --> 00:39:46.166
Something's happened.

514
00:39:50.997 --> 00:39:52.172
What's goin' on?

515
00:40:09.276 --> 00:40:10.799
- Is that--
- It's Lawrence.

516
00:40:11.713 --> 00:40:13.715
Kane. Kane.

517
00:40:16.457 --> 00:40:19.025
Oh. my God.
- How?

518
00:40:19.025 --> 00:40:21.941
Well. gee. let me guess.
He was stabbed.

519
00:40:21.941 --> 00:40:23.421
Kid. go and get the help.

520
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:27.381
Why put the knife
in the tree?

521
00:40:27.381 --> 00:40:29.078
Maybe it was a message.

522
00:40:29.078 --> 00:40:31.080
Who could do such a thing?

523
00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:32.734
Someone very determined.

524
00:40:32.734 --> 00:40:35.128
And someone very strong.

525
00:40:35.128 --> 00:40:37.173
Miranda. where are you--
Oh. hell.

526
00:41:28.486 --> 00:41:29.965
You gonna swim for it?

527
00:41:32.577 --> 00:41:34.535
You know. you don't strike me
as the type of person

528
00:41:34.535 --> 00:41:37.320
to go sightseeing
while the rest of us get hunted.

529
00:41:38.408 --> 00:41:41.020
This is a nightmare.
The rabbits.

530
00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:42.108
I saw.

531
00:41:42.848 --> 00:41:44.240
What do we do?

532
00:41:46.895 --> 00:41:47.940
Use this. sweetheart.

533
00:41:48.767 --> 00:41:50.333
It's not enough. Donald.

534
00:41:50.333 --> 00:41:53.249
Yeah. well. the world's
full of disappointments.

535
00:41:53.249 --> 00:41:55.556
Look. I've been around.

536
00:41:55.556 --> 00:42:00.300
One thing I've learned
is you do what you gotta do
with what you got.

537
00:42:02.171 --> 00:42:03.869
What if I can't?

538
00:42:04.783 --> 00:42:07.481
Well. then we probably all die.

539
00:42:26.631 --> 00:42:28.633
We should gather in the lounge.

540
00:42:29.634 --> 00:42:30.939
Is that really a good idea?

541
00:42:30.939 --> 00:42:33.376
Yes. and it wasn't a request.

542
00:42:44.823 --> 00:42:46.172
Follow.

543
00:42:57.792 --> 00:42:59.925
Let me try once more
from the top.

544
00:43:01.187 --> 00:43:04.538
Phillip and Carmen
were in the east wing hall.

545
00:43:04.538 --> 00:43:09.282
Lu was in her room.
I was in the study.
Donald was outside.

546
00:43:09.282 --> 00:43:11.197
and the staff is still
all unaccounted for

547
00:43:11.197 --> 00:43:12.851
during the period
where the late Mr. Kane

548
00:43:12.851 --> 00:43:15.593
was being brutally murdered.

549
00:43:15.593 --> 00:43:18.421
As such. I have concluded
that we must treat everyone.

550
00:43:18.421 --> 00:43:20.119
myself included. as a suspect.

551
00:43:20.119 --> 00:43:22.948
- Now. hold on a second. You--
- No one has a valid alibi.

552
00:43:22.948 --> 00:43:24.776
it is the only logical
starting point.

553
00:43:24.776 --> 00:43:26.778
Phillip and I already said

554
00:43:26.778 --> 00:43:28.388
that we were together
in the hall.

555
00:43:28.388 --> 00:43:30.042
Did anyone else
verify this encounter?

556
00:43:30.042 --> 00:43:31.652
I'm sorry.
Is our word no good?

557
00:43:31.652 --> 00:43:33.915
Given the fondness
you two have for one another.

558
00:43:33.915 --> 00:43:36.439
it is equally as plausible
you would cover for each other

559
00:43:36.439 --> 00:43:39.094
as it is that you were together
in the east wing hall.

560
00:43:39.094 --> 00:43:41.923
Huh. she's got you there. kiddies.

561
00:43:42.968 --> 00:43:44.926
And what of you and the Yank?

562
00:43:44.926 --> 00:43:47.407
Don't think we haven't
all witnessed your conspiring?

563
00:43:47.407 --> 00:43:50.018
Which is why Mr. Walker
is atop my list of suspects.

564
00:43:50.018 --> 00:43:53.674
Wait. what?
You ungrateful--

565
00:43:53.674 --> 00:43:55.545
You were the closest
to the body.

566
00:43:55.545 --> 00:43:58.070
You are also
the most physically able
to overpower Lawrence.

567
00:43:58.070 --> 00:43:59.288
I barely knew the guy!

568
00:43:59.288 --> 00:44:02.378
Exactly.
We barely know each other.

569
00:44:02.378 --> 00:44:04.250
and you barely knew
the deceased.

570
00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:06.295
We must try to figure out
what connects us

571
00:44:06.295 --> 00:44:08.210
to understand
who has a true motive.

572
00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:12.650
Right now.
this is just conjecture
and baseless speculation.

573
00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:14.216
It would help
if we knew anything

574
00:44:14.216 --> 00:44:17.698
about the late Mr. Kane
as a start. anything at all.

575
00:44:22.007 --> 00:44:23.791
- Sean?
- Ma'am.

576
00:44:23.791 --> 00:44:26.489
Can you go look at the body?
Check his pockets.

577
00:44:26.489 --> 00:44:29.057
See if there's anything
that might help us know him
a little better.

578
00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:32.582
Yes. of course. ma'am.

579
00:44:34.497 --> 00:44:37.675
Wait. someone
should go with him.

580
00:44:39.328 --> 00:44:42.157
- I'll accompany Sean.
- Thank you. sir.

581
00:44:42.157 --> 00:44:44.899
Maybe someone not on the staff.

582
00:45:03.788 --> 00:45:04.789
I will go.

583
00:45:08.967 --> 00:45:10.446
Thank you. my dear.

584
00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.276
Well. alright.

585
00:45:15.625 --> 00:45:18.846
Now. sweetheart.
this should be good.

586
00:45:20.326 --> 00:45:24.765
What's the baseless
speculation about you?

587
00:45:24.765 --> 00:45:27.420
Ah. a delightful exercise.

588
00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:31.293
Well. I found
the deceased boorish.

589
00:45:31.293 --> 00:45:33.121
And I was the last person
in the study.

590
00:45:33.121 --> 00:45:35.428
where the dagger
resided on Findley's desk.

591
00:45:35.428 --> 00:45:39.693
Right now. we all have
conceivable opportunity
and equally likely motives.

592
00:45:39.693 --> 00:45:42.348
which is why
we can't rule anyone out.

593
00:45:43.828 --> 00:45:44.872
Including you.

594
00:45:55.709 --> 00:45:59.191
Miss Green.
I hardly think that's
an appropriate accusation.

595
00:45:59.191 --> 00:46:01.715
If we know little
about each other.
we know even less about them.

596
00:46:01.715 --> 00:46:03.282
And it was one of us killed!

597
00:46:03.282 --> 00:46:05.240
We mustn't resort
to tribal suspicions.

598
00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:08.374
I am merely asserting
that anyone of us
can be a suspect

599
00:46:08.374 --> 00:46:09.897
until we can gather
more information

600
00:46:09.897 --> 00:46:12.160
and begin
ruling individuals out.

601
00:46:13.379 --> 00:46:14.946
- The body is gone!
- What?

602
00:46:14.946 --> 00:46:16.991
Mr. Kane's body is missing.

603
00:46:16.991 --> 00:46:18.253
I think we all understood
the first time.

604
00:46:18.253 --> 00:46:20.342
but just to reiterate. what?

605
00:46:20.342 --> 00:46:22.605
Bodies do not just get up
and walk away.

606
00:46:22.605 --> 00:46:25.652
No. dear. they do not.
And I know from experience.

607
00:46:25.652 --> 00:46:27.567
I need to see this for myself.

608
00:46:34.139 --> 00:46:37.795
Okay. What did you do?

609
00:46:37.795 --> 00:46:39.709
What's going on?
Is the body there or not?

610
00:46:39.709 --> 00:46:41.537
- No.
- That's impossible.

611
00:46:41.537 --> 00:46:43.278
Not if she
and the old man moved it.

612
00:46:43.278 --> 00:46:46.499
Why and how would I
accomplish that. Mr. Walker?

613
00:46:46.499 --> 00:46:48.109
One mystery at a time.

614
00:46:48.109 --> 00:46:50.024
I still think they
had something to do with it.

615
00:46:50.024 --> 00:46:52.766
We must watch our insinuations
and accusations.

616
00:46:52.766 --> 00:46:56.248
Oh. now. we should
watch our insinuations?

617
00:46:56.248 --> 00:46:59.164
I'd like to know
where all of you were
at the time Kane was killed.

618
00:46:59.164 --> 00:47:01.819
and it would be
in your best interest
to tell us now.

619
00:47:01.819 --> 00:47:04.865
- Is that a threat. sir?
- I don't know. Jeeves. is it?

620
00:47:04.865 --> 00:47:06.388
Now. hold on.
this is ridiculous.

621
00:47:06.388 --> 00:47:09.348
We must not to let our emotions
get the best of us.

622
00:47:09.348 --> 00:47:11.437
May I make a suggestion?

623
00:47:11.437 --> 00:47:13.352
You haven't needed
permission thus far.

624
00:47:14.396 --> 00:47:16.703
Why don't we take
to our rooms until dinner?

625
00:47:16.703 --> 00:47:19.880
It's 5:00 now.
that's two and a half hours.

626
00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:22.578
That's plenty of time
for tempers to subside

627
00:47:22.578 --> 00:47:24.058
and then we can start
a conversation

628
00:47:24.058 --> 00:47:26.931
that's based on facts
and provable truths.

629
00:47:26.931 --> 00:47:28.889
What about us?

630
00:47:28.889 --> 00:47:31.152
Who is supposed
to prepare the meal?

631
00:47:31.152 --> 00:47:33.067
I don't feel safe
in the kitchen alone.

632
00:47:33.067 --> 00:47:36.331
Why don't we take heed
to travel in pairs or groups?

633
00:47:36.331 --> 00:47:39.247
- This is a good idea.
- Fine by me.

634
00:47:47.386 --> 00:47:49.170
Lock your doors!

635
00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:50.302
I need a drink.

636
00:47:50.302 --> 00:47:52.434
Refreshments can be
brought up. sir.

637
00:47:52.434 --> 00:47:54.523
- Yeah. I got it. Thanks.
- Of course.

638
00:47:54.523 --> 00:47:56.047
My dear. shall we?

639
00:48:00.094 --> 00:48:01.791
Well. that was a mistake.

640
00:48:01.791 --> 00:48:05.230
I don't remember you
asking for my loyalty.

641
00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:08.407
And. more importantly.
I don't remember
giving you mine.

642
00:48:08.407 --> 00:48:14.630
Yeah. well.
now you got no one
to watch your back. sweetheart.

643
00:48:26.425 --> 00:48:28.731
When the others
lock their doors.

644
00:48:28.731 --> 00:48:31.909
please come to my room.
I don't wanna be alone.

645
00:48:31.909 --> 00:48:35.347
Of course.
but we must be careful

646
00:48:35.347 --> 00:48:37.001
until we get off this island.

647
00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:42.832
Come on.

648
00:49:43.110 --> 00:49:45.547
I'm so scared.

649
00:49:45.547 --> 00:49:47.245
Findley will be here
in the morning.

650
00:49:47.245 --> 00:49:48.942
and we'll get to
the bottom of all this.

651
00:49:48.942 --> 00:49:50.509
There's nothing to fear.

652
00:49:50.509 --> 00:49:52.293
And what of us?

653
00:49:52.293 --> 00:49:55.775
We can leave and be together.

654
00:49:55.775 --> 00:49:57.385
You can visit me in London.

655
00:49:57.385 --> 00:49:59.431
London is dreary.

656
00:50:00.606 --> 00:50:02.260
Then I shall come to Seville.

657
00:50:03.435 --> 00:50:05.524
I hate Seville.

658
00:50:06.568 --> 00:50:09.354
Then we can go anywhere
in the world that you desire.

659
00:50:09.354 --> 00:50:13.662
And if you can't pick one place.
we'll go everywhere.

660
00:50:13.662 --> 00:50:16.970
It doesn't matter
so long as we're together.

661
00:50:18.058 --> 00:50:20.017
What a beautiful dream.

662
00:50:20.017 --> 00:50:21.714
Then let's make it real.

663
00:50:24.891 --> 00:50:28.242
Sometimes I forget
how young you are.

664
00:50:29.287 --> 00:50:31.376
how simple your life has been.

665
00:50:32.942 --> 00:50:34.118
What does that mean?

666
00:50:38.035 --> 00:50:40.298
Nothing. darling.

667
00:50:40.298 --> 00:50:42.735
Tell me more
about your beautiful dream.

668
00:50:58.229 --> 00:51:00.274
- What's wrong?

669
00:51:03.016 --> 00:51:05.105
It will all be over soon.

670
00:51:07.542 --> 00:51:09.718
Everything is going
as anticipated.

671
00:51:09.718 --> 00:51:10.763
Hmm.

672
00:53:13.407 --> 00:53:16.149
What? What?

673
00:53:16.149 --> 00:53:21.110
No. No! No! No! No!

674
00:53:46.701 --> 00:53:47.963
Where's Sean?

675
00:53:50.879 --> 00:53:52.838
Probably puttering
about somewhere.

676
00:53:54.883 --> 00:53:56.581
No. he's supposed to be here.

677
00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:50.287
This man is dead.

678
00:54:54.116 --> 00:54:55.901
Take the body to the lounge.

679
00:55:05.737 --> 00:55:08.392
Every contact leaves a trace.

680
00:55:12.439 --> 00:55:14.354
- Oh. that's odd.
- What?

681
00:55:14.354 --> 00:55:15.921
To whom does this belong?

682
00:55:18.053 --> 00:55:22.144
- Miss Wang. please follow me.
- Where are we going?

683
00:55:22.144 --> 00:55:24.538
You'll be spending
the rest of the night
locked in your room.

684
00:55:24.538 --> 00:55:27.106
and in the morning
you'll be turned over
to the proper authorities.

685
00:55:27.106 --> 00:55:28.629
I did not kill this man!

686
00:55:28.629 --> 00:55:31.066
Miss Wang.
don't make this any harder
than it needs to be!

687
00:55:31.066 --> 00:55:33.112
This is outrageous!

688
00:55:33.112 --> 00:55:35.549
Why would I kill this man?
How would I kill him?

689
00:55:35.549 --> 00:55:37.203
Sean was an old man.

690
00:55:37.203 --> 00:55:40.728
The killer did incapacitate him
by knocking him with the door.

691
00:55:40.728 --> 00:55:43.165
It's not outside the realm
of possibility.

692
00:55:43.165 --> 00:55:45.037
That's it. come along.

693
00:55:45.037 --> 00:55:47.953
No. wait! I'll be back
in less than an hour.

694
00:55:49.346 --> 00:55:50.782
Do not lock this woman up yet.

695
00:55:50.782 --> 00:55:53.654
or I'll have you arrested
for false imprisonment.

696
00:55:55.830 --> 00:55:56.831
Thought so.

697
00:55:58.093 --> 00:56:00.052
Wait! Where are you going?

698
00:56:00.052 --> 00:56:01.270
She's deranged.

699
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:03.403
Nothing new on that front.

700
00:56:38.743 --> 00:56:41.049
I don't understand
how this is happening.

701
00:56:42.050 --> 00:56:43.356
I know. my dear.

702
00:56:44.879 --> 00:56:46.403
It's all very shocking.

703
00:56:47.186 --> 00:56:50.450
How can they just be dead?
It's only been one day.

704
00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:54.976
One day and two men
are just... dead.

705
00:56:54.976 --> 00:56:56.848
Dying ain't hard. sweetheart.

706
00:56:58.066 --> 00:56:59.677
Everybody does it.

707
00:57:10.252 --> 00:57:11.863
Meet Blunder.

708
00:57:12.690 --> 00:57:14.082
Findley's dog.

709
00:57:14.082 --> 00:57:17.564
- Findley's dead dog.

710
00:57:17.564 --> 00:57:20.393
- Not quite.
- Miss Green. what is
the meaning of all this.

711
00:57:20.393 --> 00:57:21.655
and what does it have to do
with the dog?

712
00:57:21.655 --> 00:57:23.527
I think we can drop that now.

713
00:57:25.964 --> 00:57:29.620
Everyone. meet Lewis Findley.

714
00:57:30.838 --> 00:57:31.839
What?

715
00:57:37.018 --> 00:57:38.019
How?

716
00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:42.633
Show. don't tell. Mr. Armstrong.

717
00:57:44.678 --> 00:57:45.940
See?

718
00:57:48.639 --> 00:57:51.293
Now. Gordon. be a dear
and open your coat.

719
00:57:57.038 --> 00:58:00.607
It would be improper
for a textile man
to dress beneath his station.

720
00:58:00.607 --> 00:58:02.043
Says who?

721
00:58:02.043 --> 00:58:05.046
Lewis Findley. before he
went underground in 1897.

722
00:58:05.046 --> 00:58:09.486
So. that's it?
That's your big reveal? A coat?

723
00:58:10.312 --> 00:58:12.793
No. that's just a taste.

724
00:58:19.757 --> 00:58:21.715
Watch your step.
careful now.

725
00:58:31.943 --> 00:58:35.816
Alright. you got us
all packed in here. Now. what?

726
00:58:35.816 --> 00:58:39.341
Right. well. in the hour
or so before dinner--

727
00:58:39.341 --> 00:58:40.952
You mean when we were
supposed to be cloistered.

728
00:58:40.952 --> 00:58:43.824
Oh. where's the fun in that.
Mr. Walker?

729
00:58:43.824 --> 00:58:47.262
I took the liberty
of taking a tour of the house
without a guide.

730
00:58:47.262 --> 00:58:52.311
It really is
an expansive property.
full of nooks and crannies.

731
00:58:52.311 --> 00:58:55.270
Plenty of places
to hide secrets.

732
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:57.969
And that's when
I came upon this room.

733
00:58:57.969 --> 00:58:59.492
Now. I don't know
if you've noticed.

734
00:58:59.492 --> 00:59:02.539
but there are no photographs
or portraits in the house.

735
00:59:02.539 --> 00:59:05.629
Lewis Findley was apparently
a recluse of the highest order.

736
00:59:05.629 --> 00:59:08.806
who abhorred having his likeness
taken in any way.

737
00:59:08.806 --> 00:59:12.200
I'm sure that's what sparked
your interest. right.
Mr. Walker?

738
00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:14.812
Um. yeah.
Yeah. 'cause the old man.

739
00:59:14.812 --> 00:59:20.252
he was always using
an interme... intermediary.

740
00:59:20.252 --> 00:59:21.296
You.

741
00:59:22.384 --> 00:59:24.604
I knew--
I knew you from somewhere.

742
00:59:24.604 --> 00:59:29.478
This guy-- you were his stand in
at the meeting with Carnegie
in New York. weren't you?

743
00:59:31.263 --> 00:59:32.960
Which time?

744
00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:35.963
Mr. Carnegie was very fond
of his little events.

745
00:59:35.963 --> 00:59:39.750
There was always a banquet
or a dedication
that we mustn't miss.

746
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:41.316
This is getting
a bit off topic.

747
00:59:41.316 --> 00:59:43.057
There'll be time enough
for that later.

748
00:59:43.057 --> 00:59:46.757
At the moment. we must continue
with the task at hand.

749
00:59:46.757 --> 00:59:50.674
His perceived aversion
to photographs
was not entirely accurate.

750
00:59:54.634 --> 00:59:58.159
Wow. the old man
really liked the mutt.

751
00:59:58.159 --> 01:00:01.728
Which is why he hid Blunder
in a small.

752
01:00:01.728 --> 01:00:03.817
though surprisingly
comfortable shack

753
01:00:03.817 --> 01:00:05.993
on the northernmost point
of the island.

754
01:00:05.993 --> 01:00:08.387
I saw it on my way
to the cliffs.

755
01:00:08.387 --> 01:00:11.738
Poor Blunder. he just
couldn't uphold the ruse.

756
01:00:11.738 --> 01:00:15.089
And that brings me
to my last surprise.

757
01:00:15.089 --> 01:00:17.396
If you'll all follow me
to the lounge.

758
01:00:17.396 --> 01:00:20.225
This behavior
seems a bit ghoulish
given the circumstances.

759
01:00:20.225 --> 01:00:22.053
I rather like it.

760
01:00:25.056 --> 01:00:27.493
Gettin' a little sick
of your games. old man.

761
01:00:33.804 --> 01:00:36.284
Alright. all settled?

762
01:00:36.284 --> 01:00:38.112
This better be good. sweetheart.

763
01:00:38.112 --> 01:00:42.377
Miranda. please.
there have been two murders.

764
01:00:42.377 --> 01:00:44.031
We are very afraid.

765
01:00:44.031 --> 01:00:47.861
No. you're right.
I have been a bit glib.

766
01:00:47.861 --> 01:00:50.777
The truth is a man has died.

767
01:00:50.777 --> 01:00:55.652
and it's a somber occasion.
traumatic even.

768
01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:58.132
But you are wrong on one count.

769
01:00:58.132 --> 01:00:59.699
You may come in.

770
01:01:09.753 --> 01:01:10.797
Hello all.

771
01:01:12.886 --> 01:01:15.715
Uh. terribly sorry
about the morbid theatrics.

772
01:01:15.715 --> 01:01:19.458
- I'm gonna kill you.
you no good son--
- Oh!

773
01:01:19.458 --> 01:01:20.720
- No. no. no. no. no. no. no!
Let go!

774
01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:22.548
Mr. Walker.
No. no!

775
01:01:22.548 --> 01:01:26.334
What a big. twisted-- damn you--
I got it. I'm fine. I'm fine.

776
01:01:26.334 --> 01:01:27.945
Alright. let go. Alright.

777
01:01:29.468 --> 01:01:30.861
But you're gonna
answer some questions

778
01:01:30.861 --> 01:01:32.558
if you wanna
get off this island alive.

779
01:01:32.558 --> 01:01:35.474
That is. uh. more than fair.
all being all things considered.

780
01:01:35.474 --> 01:01:38.172
but if you'll allow me
to explain.

781
01:01:38.172 --> 01:01:41.698
you may find that I am not
completely deserving
of execution.

782
01:01:50.881 --> 01:01:54.449
Would anyone else care for one
before we begin?

783
01:01:54.449 --> 01:01:57.844
Yeah. I'll have one.

784
01:02:21.346 --> 01:02:23.609
Right. on with the show.

785
01:02:25.089 --> 01:02:28.745
Many months ago I was approached
by Lord Findley here

786
01:02:28.745 --> 01:02:32.531
with a rather strange proposition

787
01:02:32.531 --> 01:02:35.142
and an even stranger scheme.

788
01:02:36.448 --> 01:02:38.624
<i>Lord Findley valued his privacy</i>

789
01:02:38.624 --> 01:02:42.193
<i>above nearly all else.
that much is true.</i>

790
01:02:42.193 --> 01:02:44.804
<i>He never took a family.</i>

791
01:02:44.804 --> 01:02:47.894
<i>but that is not to suggest
he didn't seek</i>

792
01:02:47.894 --> 01:02:52.507
intimate companionship
in his day.

793
01:02:52.507 --> 01:02:57.599
In point of fact. Mr. Findley
was a bit of a lothario.
and believed himself

794
01:02:57.599 --> 01:03:00.602
<i>to have sired
a number of children.</i>

795
01:03:00.602 --> 01:03:04.650
<i>all of whom
could serve as his heirs
when the time came.</i>

796
01:03:05.869 --> 01:03:08.915
<i>And the hour
was approaching fast.</i>

797
01:03:10.743 --> 01:03:12.789
Lord Findley
was unwilling. however.

798
01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:16.314
to turn his immense fortune
over to a complete stranger.

799
01:03:16.314 --> 01:03:22.363
much less so to. as he put it.
an undeserving lout.

800
01:03:23.756 --> 01:03:27.455
The man really seemed
most invested

801
01:03:27.455 --> 01:03:30.154
<i>in what would happen
to his holdings
and his business.</i>

802
01:03:31.459 --> 01:03:35.594
<i>He made it very clear.
"One heir".</i>

803
01:03:35.594 --> 01:03:38.379
To the rest. well... phew.

804
01:03:39.337 --> 01:03:40.555
So. off I went.

805
01:03:47.867 --> 01:03:53.003
Five children deemed most fit
to inherit the immense fortune.

806
01:03:54.004 --> 01:03:56.571
Five invitations.

807
01:04:12.805 --> 01:04:17.114
But that was only the beginning.
for how was Findley to choose?

808
01:04:18.506 --> 01:04:21.379
Give the old man
credit for creativity.

809
01:04:21.379 --> 01:04:23.990
He hired a pair of actors.

810
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:26.297
that he used from time to time
as surrogates.

811
01:04:26.297 --> 01:04:29.474
to play his staff
alongside himself.

812
01:04:29.474 --> 01:04:33.826
<i>as he would adopt the role
of the venerable butler Sean.</i>

813
01:04:35.436 --> 01:04:38.700
But how to provoke a person.

814
01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:41.965
to reveal their true nature
in but a short weekend.

815
01:04:41.965 --> 01:04:45.838
which Findley insisted
was all he needed
to choose an heir?

816
01:04:47.144 --> 01:04:50.887
<i>I suppose a murder
was as good a way as any.</i>

817
01:05:00.548 --> 01:05:04.248
The rest. the lights. and such.

818
01:05:04.248 --> 01:05:08.295
were all meant to invoke
tension and unease.

819
01:05:10.341 --> 01:05:13.518
And the rabbits?

820
01:05:15.389 --> 01:05:16.651
Rabbits?

821
01:05:16.651 --> 01:05:18.958
In the woods.
there's a small shack

822
01:05:18.958 --> 01:05:21.308
with five live rabbits.
one dead.

823
01:05:21.308 --> 01:05:22.962
They looked to represent us.

824
01:05:22.962 --> 01:05:26.748
Oh. I believe they were
just meant as fresh meat
for the dog.

825
01:05:27.662 --> 01:05:31.405
Sorry it isn't
a saucier reason. my dear.

826
01:05:31.405 --> 01:05:34.626
My employer was eccentric.
not insane.

827
01:05:34.626 --> 01:05:36.280
Yeah.
I don't see the difference.

828
01:05:37.237 --> 01:05:38.891
He wanted to test you.

829
01:05:40.414 --> 01:05:44.418
This. however.
wasn't part of the plan.

830
01:05:47.421 --> 01:05:52.035
Lord Findley
had fully intended to reveal
his selection tomorrow.

831
01:05:54.863 --> 01:05:58.737
I'm sorry. I truly am.

832
01:06:04.395 --> 01:06:07.180
Where are Gordon and Katherine?

833
01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:08.486
Who cares?

834
01:06:10.053 --> 01:06:11.358
They can't leave.

835
01:06:13.752 --> 01:06:15.145
About that.

836
01:06:15.145 --> 01:06:16.233
Hurry. dear!

837
01:06:16.233 --> 01:06:17.886
I'm trying!

838
01:06:17.886 --> 01:06:19.149
We must launch!

839
01:06:26.025 --> 01:06:29.159
Let him up. we'll come quietly!
Oh. do something!

840
01:06:29.159 --> 01:06:31.204
- He's going to kill him!
- Donald!

841
01:06:31.204 --> 01:06:33.250
Where were you going. huh?

842
01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:34.816
Donald. let him up right now.

843
01:06:34.816 --> 01:06:37.210
or I'll make sure you spend
the rest of your life in jail!

844
01:06:42.215 --> 01:06:43.695
Why run?

845
01:06:43.695 --> 01:06:46.828
Look. miss. it was a gig.

846
01:06:46.828 --> 01:06:48.917
and a bloody good one
at that. huh?

847
01:06:50.223 --> 01:06:51.964
Findley was a bit
of an odd fellow.

848
01:06:51.964 --> 01:06:54.967
bit cold as well.
but he took care of us.

849
01:06:54.967 --> 01:06:57.056
paid us well.

850
01:06:57.056 --> 01:07:00.233
We're not exactly
West End regulars.

851
01:07:00.233 --> 01:07:03.715
Acting gigs in London.
not exactly stable work.

852
01:07:03.715 --> 01:07:05.499
and we're not exactly
spring chickens.

853
01:07:05.499 --> 01:07:08.067
This isn't where
we thought we would end up.

854
01:07:08.067 --> 01:07:11.853
playing his staff.
being his emissaries.

855
01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:15.031
But it's been so hard.

856
01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:17.946
We've been married for 15 years
and what do we have
to show for it?

857
01:07:17.946 --> 01:07:22.081
No children.
nary a leading role between us.

858
01:07:22.081 --> 01:07:24.170
but these past few years.
working for Mr. Findley

859
01:07:24.170 --> 01:07:25.998
allowed us to buy a house
and start--

860
01:07:25.998 --> 01:07:27.652
You're not answering
the question.

861
01:07:27.652 --> 01:07:30.829
Yeah. because they don't
have an answer to the question.

862
01:07:30.829 --> 01:07:32.613
'cause they killed the old man.

863
01:07:32.613 --> 01:07:35.094
Trust me. I've seen plenty
of guilty people.

864
01:07:35.094 --> 01:07:37.140
and these two are guilty as sin.

865
01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:38.402
We didn't kill him!

866
01:07:38.402 --> 01:07:41.753
Look. let me explain.
This gig was different.

867
01:07:41.753 --> 01:07:44.582
Findley was very clear
that we should make no mistakes.

868
01:07:44.582 --> 01:07:48.934
He needed us to get the absolute
most out of each of you.

869
01:07:48.934 --> 01:07:52.372
We needed to poke. and prod.
and instigate

870
01:07:52.372 --> 01:07:55.897
as much as possible
without givin' up the game.

871
01:07:55.897 --> 01:07:59.988
And he was always there.
It was a lot of pressure.

872
01:07:59.988 --> 01:08:02.861
And then when the old man
turned up dead--

873
01:08:02.861 --> 01:08:04.167
You panicked.

874
01:08:04.167 --> 01:08:06.647
How were we going to
keep the house without...

875
01:08:08.867 --> 01:08:10.260
Oh. I'm sorry.

876
01:08:11.696 --> 01:08:14.090
You found and lost
a father today.

877
01:08:15.613 --> 01:08:16.962
It hardly compares.

878
01:08:20.574 --> 01:08:22.141
My father is Shen Wang.

879
01:08:23.403 --> 01:08:26.189
and he is alive and well
in China.

880
01:08:27.799 --> 01:08:31.150
Lewis Findley
may have known my mother.

881
01:08:31.150 --> 01:08:33.587
but he was not my father.

882
01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:36.982
Nor was he a father
to any of us.

883
01:08:38.766 --> 01:08:40.638
Not a real father. anyway.

884
01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:48.036
Thank you.

885
01:08:48.036 --> 01:08:50.387
Yeah. I don't buy it.

886
01:08:50.387 --> 01:08:52.650
So-so. let me get
this straight.

887
01:08:53.694 --> 01:08:55.609
The old man croaks.

888
01:08:55.609 --> 01:08:58.308
and the two of you decide
to take off in the boat.

889
01:08:58.308 --> 01:09:03.443
leave us stuck here
on the island. all 'cause
you got panicked. huh?

890
01:09:03.443 --> 01:09:05.228
I don't buy it. Not one bit.

891
01:09:06.664 --> 01:09:08.753
I haven't forgot
about you either. missy.

892
01:09:08.753 --> 01:09:10.102
You've been skulkin'
around the house

893
01:09:10.102 --> 01:09:12.365
since you got here
like you got somethin' to hide.

894
01:09:12.365 --> 01:09:13.801
And all of a sudden.
out of the blue.

895
01:09:13.801 --> 01:09:15.194
your scarf turns up

896
01:09:15.194 --> 01:09:17.153
wrapped around
a dead guy's neck!

897
01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:18.458
This is outlandish!

898
01:09:27.467 --> 01:09:31.471
Miss Green.
talk some sense into him.

899
01:09:31.471 --> 01:09:34.605
It is hard to understand
why you would come
all the way from China

900
01:09:34.605 --> 01:09:36.128
on little more
than an invitation.

901
01:09:36.128 --> 01:09:38.086
There you go. Thank you.

902
01:09:40.045 --> 01:09:41.786
You're not off the hook either. sweetheart.

903
01:09:41.786 --> 01:09:44.919
You're always walkin' around.
readin' your little
mystery books.

904
01:09:44.919 --> 01:09:47.661
Dreamin' of becomin'
a real detective one day.

905
01:09:47.661 --> 01:09:51.578
Then your dreams come true
and you get to solve
a real murder.

906
01:09:51.578 --> 01:09:52.927
Maybe you thought
the only thing

907
01:09:52.927 --> 01:09:56.192
better than solvin' one murder
is solvin' two. huh?

908
01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:59.107
Maybe that meant enough for you
to kill the old man yourself.

909
01:09:59.107 --> 01:10:01.893
Alright. this is
a reasonable enough theory.

910
01:10:01.893 --> 01:10:03.808
But there's more
connecting you to the murder.

911
01:10:03.808 --> 01:10:06.767
- Like what?
- You despise
the trappings of wealth.

912
01:10:06.767 --> 01:10:08.943
and we've already seen
the ferocity of your rage.

913
01:10:08.943 --> 01:10:11.032
Oh. there it is.

914
01:10:11.032 --> 01:10:13.339
Soon as chips are down.
you come after me every time.

915
01:10:13.339 --> 01:10:15.733
This is getting ridiculous.

916
01:10:15.733 --> 01:10:17.952
We know that someone
killed Mr. Findley.

917
01:10:17.952 --> 01:10:21.086
The impostors are suspects.
as well as Mr. Walker.

918
01:10:21.086 --> 01:10:24.176
Miss Green. and Miss Wang.
but we are talking in circles.

919
01:10:24.176 --> 01:10:27.875
I'd say that list
is a bit short. don't you?

920
01:10:27.875 --> 01:10:31.183
What are you implying.
Mr. Kane?

921
01:10:31.183 --> 01:10:33.664
I could never harm anyone.

922
01:10:40.323 --> 01:10:41.759
Phillip. tell them.

923
01:10:41.759 --> 01:10:44.501
It's unlikely.

924
01:10:44.501 --> 01:10:47.068
But you would do anything
to avoid returning to Seville.

925
01:10:49.201 --> 01:10:51.943
And what of you?
Are you not above suspicion?

926
01:10:51.943 --> 01:10:53.423
That's outrageous!

927
01:10:53.423 --> 01:10:55.425
I am a doctor.
My job is to help and heal.

928
01:10:55.425 --> 01:10:57.905
As though no doctor
has ever committed
nefarious deeds?

929
01:10:57.905 --> 01:10:59.820
What of your Jack the Ripper?

930
01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:01.779
Are there no theories
that he is a doctor?

931
01:11:01.779 --> 01:11:05.217
One baseless theory
implicates all doctors.
Brilliant. Well done.

932
01:11:05.217 --> 01:11:07.872
- What about H.H. Holmes?
- And Hawley Crippen.

933
01:11:07.872 --> 01:11:10.962
Burke and Hare sold bodies
to medical schools.

934
01:11:10.962 --> 01:11:12.877
Bodies that they stole
and murdered.

935
01:11:12.877 --> 01:11:14.357
Morality lessons from a lawyer.

936
01:11:14.357 --> 01:11:16.054
and a lawyer that took part
in this charade no less.

937
01:11:16.054 --> 01:11:17.621
That's very rich
coming from you. old boy.

938
01:11:17.621 --> 01:11:19.187
I suppose this was inevitable.

939
01:11:19.187 --> 01:11:21.668
But since we're all passing
blame around tonight.

940
01:11:21.668 --> 01:11:25.368
humor me. why would I kill
my employer. hmm?

941
01:11:25.368 --> 01:11:28.545
Maybe because
you're the only one
with access to the will.

942
01:11:28.545 --> 01:11:31.069
- What?
- If you could add one of us.

943
01:11:31.069 --> 01:11:33.027
you could just as easily
add yourself.

944
01:11:33.027 --> 01:11:34.899
You wouldn't even have
to take the whole fortune.

945
01:11:34.899 --> 01:11:37.423
You could just carve off
a little piece of the estate
for yourself.

946
01:11:37.423 --> 01:11:41.819
Well. considering I currently
don't have access to the will.
I'd say that's a faulty theory.

947
01:11:41.819 --> 01:11:43.821
How dare you?
You are the lawyer!

948
01:11:46.824 --> 01:11:48.565
Enough!

949
01:11:48.565 --> 01:11:50.393
This isn't getting us anywhere.

950
01:11:50.393 --> 01:11:53.483
We need to rest.
We'll call the police.

951
01:11:53.483 --> 01:11:55.354
They will handle this
in the morning.

952
01:11:55.354 --> 01:11:57.313
Good idea.

953
01:13:30.188 --> 01:13:31.319
What?

954
01:13:31.319 --> 01:13:32.799
I need you to come with me.

955
01:13:32.799 --> 01:13:34.932
I think that would be a bit daft
given the circumstances.

956
01:13:34.932 --> 01:13:37.543
Wouldn't you agree.
whatever your name is?

957
01:13:37.543 --> 01:13:39.415
Still Gordon.
That much is true.

958
01:13:40.241 --> 01:13:42.896
If I wanted you dead.
I could force my way in.

959
01:13:48.075 --> 01:13:49.686
I need to show you something.

960
01:13:53.733 --> 01:13:55.518
And why would I want to see it?

961
01:13:55.518 --> 01:13:57.694
Because I think
you can find the killer.

962
01:14:03.047 --> 01:14:07.312
You know. you had me worried
when we first met.

963
01:14:09.488 --> 01:14:12.404
Yeah. you seemed very skilled
at detecting a lie.

964
01:14:13.797 --> 01:14:16.582
But I suppose we all
have our parts to play.

965
01:14:21.152 --> 01:14:23.937
And there's only one thing
left to do at this point.

966
01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:34.034
Where is Miranda?

967
01:14:35.601 --> 01:14:37.342
Where's Gordon?

968
01:14:37.342 --> 01:14:40.606
He left in the night.

969
01:14:40.606 --> 01:14:43.087
He said he had to take care
of something in the study.

970
01:14:45.306 --> 01:14:46.351
Oh. no.

971
01:14:50.573 --> 01:14:52.096
Friends!

972
01:14:52.096 --> 01:14:54.751
Or should I say
brothers and sisters?

973
01:14:54.751 --> 01:14:56.056
Where's my husband?

974
01:14:56.056 --> 01:14:58.102
He's preparing the boat
for our departure.

975
01:14:58.102 --> 01:15:01.018
He took it a few hours ago
to fetch Detective Church here.

976
01:15:01.018 --> 01:15:04.543
Detective Harold Church.
Dartmouth constabulary. Pleasure.

977
01:15:04.543 --> 01:15:09.113
We have much to discuss.
There's a murderer in our midst.

978
01:15:09.113 --> 01:15:10.462
Aren't you being
a little cavalier?

979
01:15:10.462 --> 01:15:12.116
No reason for alarm. sir.

980
01:15:17.730 --> 01:15:20.603
Alright then. shall we?

981
01:15:50.458 --> 01:15:51.503
It is me.

982
01:15:53.026 --> 01:15:55.463
I can't be older than 14 here.

983
01:15:55.463 --> 01:16:00.425
He was watching us
all this time.

984
01:16:00.425 --> 01:16:03.254
That's just the tip
of the iceberg. I'm afraid.

985
01:16:17.224 --> 01:16:19.183
Gordon and Katherine
weren't lying

986
01:16:19.183 --> 01:16:21.141
when they said they were
keeping an eye on us.

987
01:16:22.273 --> 01:16:24.231
So. what in the hell
am I lookin' at?

988
01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:31.412
Cameras.
and expensive ones at that.

989
01:16:31.412 --> 01:16:34.459
Completely state-of-the-art.
in every room.

990
01:16:34.459 --> 01:16:36.635
with this nifty little feature
that logs footage

991
01:16:36.635 --> 01:16:39.333
- and replays it.
- Impossible.

992
01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:47.254
<i>Findley had connections
with both the American
and British military.</i>

993
01:16:47.254 --> 01:16:48.604
<i>very high up.</i>

994
01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:51.868
<i>One day the whole apparatus
just showed up</i>

995
01:16:51.868 --> 01:16:55.698
<i>with some very
serious-looking men in uniform.</i>

996
01:16:55.698 --> 01:16:57.613
<i>He showed me how to operate it.</i>

997
01:16:57.613 --> 01:17:00.746
<i>but he never said where
he obtained such technology.</i>

998
01:17:06.230 --> 01:17:08.232
I first suspected
something was off

999
01:17:08.232 --> 01:17:10.974
when I could hear Carmen
scream through the walls.

1000
01:17:10.974 --> 01:17:14.978
Even if the claims
of soundproofing
were a lie meant to scare.

1001
01:17:14.978 --> 01:17:18.242
a house as sturdy as this
should dampen the sound
a bit better.

1002
01:17:18.242 --> 01:17:21.811
but Findley had a whole network
of hallways behind these walls.

1003
01:17:21.811 --> 01:17:24.640
So. you saw the killer?

1004
01:17:26.206 --> 01:17:28.469
This is ridiculous.
I'm leavin'.

1005
01:17:28.469 --> 01:17:30.646
I'm afraid I can't let you
do that. my good man.

1006
01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:31.908
I'm sure you understand.

1007
01:17:31.908 --> 01:17:33.083
The surveillance yielded

1008
01:17:33.083 --> 01:17:35.520
a treasure trove of information.

1009
01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:38.218
but I'm sure
you'd all like some context.

1010
01:17:41.787 --> 01:17:46.444
You know. working with roses.
one becomes desensitized
to such wounds.

1011
01:17:46.444 --> 01:17:50.013
which I'm sure is something
that you have experienced.
Mr. Kane.

1012
01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:57.934
Hazards of the job.

1013
01:17:57.934 --> 01:18:03.287
And. Findley insisted on
rehearsing multiple scenarios

1014
01:18:03.287 --> 01:18:06.899
before choosing exactly
how I was to be murdered.

1015
01:18:08.248 --> 01:18:10.511
Your father's hands
weren't terribly steady.

1016
01:18:14.646 --> 01:18:16.996
How could he
treat his friends so poorly?

1017
01:18:16.996 --> 01:18:18.955
Men that rich
don't mix with staff.

1018
01:18:18.955 --> 01:18:23.046
I should take offense.
but spot on. old boy.

1019
01:18:24.656 --> 01:18:26.963
As I'm sure you know our father
was quite the traveler.

1020
01:18:26.963 --> 01:18:29.748
and he made sure
to document his adventures.

1021
01:18:29.748 --> 01:18:33.143
even his dalliances.
Liu Chan.

1022
01:18:33.143 --> 01:18:34.797
My mother.

1023
01:18:34.797 --> 01:18:36.363
Esme Blanco.

1024
01:18:36.973 --> 01:18:38.017
And mine.

1025
01:18:40.063 --> 01:18:41.194
Please don't.

1026
01:18:43.370 --> 01:18:46.156
Naturally. my mother was here.

1027
01:18:46.156 --> 01:18:47.984
But one name was missing.

1028
01:18:47.984 --> 01:18:52.118
No Walkers. no Americans.
nothing of the sort.

1029
01:18:52.118 --> 01:18:56.253
But there was one name
that appears again and again:
Shelby.

1030
01:18:56.253 --> 01:19:00.648
She was the first.
a maid who worked on the estate.

1031
01:19:00.648 --> 01:19:03.782
and apparently she left
quite an impact on Findley.

1032
01:19:03.782 --> 01:19:07.699
The first few pages
are documented meticulously.

1033
01:19:07.699 --> 01:19:09.832
and with a romantic fervor
that Findley

1034
01:19:09.832 --> 01:19:13.009
seemed unable to access
for anything else in his life.

1035
01:19:14.358 --> 01:19:17.796
Shelby and her child.

1036
01:19:17.796 --> 01:19:23.933
For you see. the maid
had a child. a boy.

1037
01:19:38.077 --> 01:19:40.558
Detective. will you check
his breast pocket?

1038
01:19:41.689 --> 01:19:43.343
Steady now. big fellow.

1039
01:20:02.623 --> 01:20:06.540
Yes. Shelby Walker
and Lewis Findley.

1040
01:20:08.412 --> 01:20:10.588
I'm afraid
this doesn't prove much.

1041
01:20:10.588 --> 01:20:12.590
Just wait.

1042
01:20:22.382 --> 01:20:24.210
He said he'd marry her.

1043
01:20:26.212 --> 01:20:27.823
Over and over and over.

1044
01:20:30.216 --> 01:20:36.570
So. she waited. and waited
for him to tell his parents.

1045
01:20:37.528 --> 01:20:40.052
She was young. she had time.

1046
01:20:40.052 --> 01:20:41.967
But then she got pregnant...

1047
01:20:45.057 --> 01:20:46.885
and that changed everything.

1048
01:20:49.366 --> 01:20:53.152
Said he had no choice
but to fire her.

1049
01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:58.592
And she got-- she got nothing...

1050
01:21:00.899 --> 01:21:04.033
because payouts raise questions.

1051
01:21:07.036 --> 01:21:10.082
So. she had--
she had nowhere to go.

1052
01:21:12.737 --> 01:21:15.218
Her own family
wouldn't let her in.

1053
01:21:15.218 --> 01:21:20.701
because she was unmarried
and carrying a...

1054
01:21:22.007 --> 01:21:25.881
a bastard son.

1055
01:21:25.881 --> 01:21:29.885
So. she moved to the States.

1056
01:21:32.017 --> 01:21:33.758
She had me on the boat.

1057
01:21:35.238 --> 01:21:37.022
She always clung to this hope

1058
01:21:37.022 --> 01:21:42.071
that... that one-day Findley
would come for her.

1059
01:21:43.811 --> 01:21:46.553
We would live
in the lap of luxury.

1060
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:51.602
She refused to find
any permanent work.

1061
01:21:51.602 --> 01:21:56.999
because she was sure
that any day now.
her prince would come.

1062
01:21:56.999 --> 01:22:00.045
She'd say.
"Daddy will come save us."

1063
01:22:03.396 --> 01:22:04.702
Daddy.

1064
01:22:08.010 --> 01:22:09.489
Then she got sick.

1065
01:22:12.710 --> 01:22:16.888
So sick that she swallowed
her pride and she...

1066
01:22:16.888 --> 01:22:23.547
she wrote Findley a letter.
begging for help.

1067
01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:28.944
Not a word.

1068
01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:32.904
And she made sure
that I knew the truth

1069
01:22:32.904 --> 01:22:36.560
about Findley before she died.

1070
01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:39.171
And when her day came...

1071
01:22:40.956 --> 01:22:43.175
that was there
that I vowed that...

1072
01:22:45.351 --> 01:22:48.006
I would come after Findley

1073
01:22:48.006 --> 01:22:51.009
and everyone like him
for the rest of my life.

1074
01:22:54.273 --> 01:22:56.058
See. the rich and powerful.

1075
01:22:56.058 --> 01:23:01.715
they know that information
can do more harm

1076
01:23:01.715 --> 01:23:06.111
than any-any knife or pistol.

1077
01:23:06.111 --> 01:23:09.245
So. I became
a hunter of secrets.

1078
01:23:11.203 --> 01:23:14.119
I would find their sins
and I would drag 'em out

1079
01:23:14.119 --> 01:23:17.905
into the cold light of day
for everyone to see.

1080
01:23:17.905 --> 01:23:20.082
He watched your every move.

1081
01:23:27.611 --> 01:23:28.786
Those...

1082
01:23:32.224 --> 01:23:33.878
those are my stories.

1083
01:23:33.878 --> 01:23:37.055
It's all in the journal.
He was terribly proud of you.

1084
01:23:38.448 --> 01:23:40.493
He didn't care much
for your politics.

1085
01:23:40.493 --> 01:23:42.974
but your drive.
your relentlessness.

1086
01:23:42.974 --> 01:23:45.542
You were everything
he wanted in an heir.

1087
01:23:45.542 --> 01:23:47.152
'cause you were just like him.

1088
01:23:47.152 --> 01:23:49.546
I was nothing like him!

1089
01:23:49.546 --> 01:23:51.156
I mean. look around.

1090
01:23:51.156 --> 01:23:55.378
He just left us all
to struggle and survive.

1091
01:23:55.378 --> 01:23:58.076
while he watched us
from his gilded towers.

1092
01:23:58.076 --> 01:24:02.254
And at any time. he could have
eased our suffering. but. nope.

1093
01:24:03.951 --> 01:24:06.041
He has let us twist
in the wind.

1094
01:24:07.564 --> 01:24:11.220
And then when that time
came in his life

1095
01:24:11.220 --> 01:24:13.700
to do the right thing
and let us in...

1096
01:24:17.356 --> 01:24:18.705
more games.

1097
01:24:22.405 --> 01:24:27.366
So. I did the one thing
that that man. that--

1098
01:24:27.366 --> 01:24:31.979
that coward didn't have
the decency to do.

1099
01:24:31.979 --> 01:24:33.459
I stopped the game.

1100
01:24:34.895 --> 01:24:36.332
By killing him?

1101
01:24:36.332 --> 01:24:38.203
By doing what was necessary.

1102
01:24:38.203 --> 01:24:39.509
By framing me.

1103
01:24:40.901 --> 01:24:43.774
By blaming Gordon. then Miranda.
and when that didn't work.

1104
01:24:43.774 --> 01:24:45.950
making sure we blamed
one another.

1105
01:24:45.950 --> 01:24:47.908
so that you could slip away.

1106
01:24:50.215 --> 01:24:53.349
You are the real coward!

1107
01:24:53.349 --> 01:24:54.567
Well...

1108
01:24:56.091 --> 01:24:59.355
I guess I got a bit
of the old man in me after all.

1109
01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:06.405
But y'all should be thanking me.

1110
01:25:07.972 --> 01:25:10.888
I set you free.
That money is cursed.

1111
01:25:10.888 --> 01:25:13.325
For four of us.
there is the utter degradation

1112
01:25:13.325 --> 01:25:15.675
of being told to our face
by Findley

1113
01:25:15.675 --> 01:25:17.024
that we're just not good enough.

1114
01:25:19.244 --> 01:25:22.987
And then for
the one lucky winner...

1115
01:25:25.163 --> 01:25:29.254
it's a worse fate
to be locked in a cage

1116
01:25:29.254 --> 01:25:33.258
and turned into a cheap
facsimile of him.

1117
01:25:33.258 --> 01:25:35.173
That's not exactly true.

1118
01:25:35.173 --> 01:25:37.523
This was never a game
of choosing.

1119
01:25:38.916 --> 01:25:40.831
This was due diligence.

1120
01:25:40.831 --> 01:25:42.833
It was always
going to be you. Donald.

1121
01:25:43.877 --> 01:25:46.445
This was just a test to vet you.

1122
01:25:46.445 --> 01:25:48.621
We were never serious options.

1123
01:25:48.621 --> 01:25:51.581
And now. it will be no one.

1124
01:25:52.886 --> 01:25:55.759
The inheritance
should be divided equally

1125
01:25:55.759 --> 01:25:57.761
amongst his children.
Is that not the law?

1126
01:25:57.761 --> 01:26:01.243
Possibly. but the will
was very specific

1127
01:26:01.243 --> 01:26:03.549
that should an heir
not be chosen.

1128
01:26:03.549 --> 01:26:06.378
all assets would be returned
to Findley Industries

1129
01:26:06.378 --> 01:26:09.164
and a successor
be appointed by the board.

1130
01:26:09.164 --> 01:26:15.866
If an heir were chosen. however.
all would be well taken care of.

1131
01:26:15.866 --> 01:26:18.956
Though you'd be forced to
relinquish your names.

1132
01:26:18.956 --> 01:26:22.220
sworn to secrecy under threat
of losing your buyouts.

1133
01:26:22.220 --> 01:26:24.483
Games on top of games.

1134
01:26:25.528 --> 01:26:27.269
Take him away. Detective.

1135
01:26:51.206 --> 01:26:52.990
I'm terribly sorry.

1136
01:26:52.990 --> 01:26:56.254
Had I known the depths
of his sadism.

1137
01:26:56.254 --> 01:26:59.039
I never would have partook.

1138
01:26:59.039 --> 01:27:01.128
He would have found
someone else.

1139
01:27:05.872 --> 01:27:08.484
Our father
does not define our worth.

1140
01:27:08.484 --> 01:27:10.268
nor does our station.

1141
01:27:10.268 --> 01:27:13.228
We are the masters
of our own fate.

1142
01:27:15.273 --> 01:27:19.756
- We don't need him.
- Or his money.

1143
01:27:19.756 --> 01:27:21.584
Because we have each other.

1144
01:27:41.517 --> 01:27:43.301
What's going to happen to him?

1145
01:27:43.301 --> 01:27:45.129
It should be
an open and shut case.

1146
01:27:45.129 --> 01:27:47.218
He'll spend the rest
of his life in a cell.

1147
01:27:47.218 --> 01:27:48.567
What a waste.

1148
01:27:48.567 --> 01:27:52.049
Oh. you're too kind.

1149
01:27:52.049 --> 01:27:54.878
And that's why you'll never be
a detective. sweetheart.

1150
01:27:54.878 --> 01:27:57.707
That compassion
is why I caught you.

1151
01:27:57.707 --> 01:27:59.752
and it's why
I'll catch more like you.

1152
01:28:00.753 --> 01:28:02.407
And don't call me "sweetheart."

1153
01:28:02.407 --> 01:28:04.453
Be seein' you. sis.

1154
01:28:06.368 --> 01:28:10.850
Miss. wait.
You've got a gift for this.

1155
01:28:10.850 --> 01:28:12.504
If you ever need a hand
getting started.

1156
01:28:12.504 --> 01:28:14.245
I have mates at Scotland Yard.

1157
01:28:14.245 --> 01:28:16.769
Oh. thank you.

1158
01:28:16.769 --> 01:28:19.598
But I think my services
are better utilized on my own.

1159
01:28:19.598 --> 01:28:21.905
Oh. like a private detective?
Uh. the money--

1160
01:28:21.905 --> 01:28:24.560
Oh. I've never had
much use for money.

1161
01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:28.651
but I would like to be
of service to people
who truly need it.

1162
01:28:28.651 --> 01:28:30.566
Still. I'll take this.

1163
01:28:30.566 --> 01:28:32.916
Even a good detective
needs help from time to time.

1164
01:28:32.916 --> 01:28:34.352
Right you are. miss.

1165
01:28:34.352 --> 01:28:35.701
And I'll make sure
the world knows

1166
01:28:35.701 --> 01:28:37.790
that the woman who found
Lewis Findley's killer

1167
01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:39.009
is open for business.

1168
01:28:39.009 --> 01:28:40.750
Thank you. sir.

1169
01:28:44.275 --> 01:28:46.799
I was thinking about us.

1170
01:28:47.365 --> 01:28:48.758
As was I.

1171
01:28:50.063 --> 01:28:52.283
Just because
we can't be together.

1172
01:28:52.283 --> 01:28:54.720
doesn't mean we can't be
in each other's lives.

1173
01:28:57.070 --> 01:28:59.377
I've never had
a little brother before.

1174
01:28:59.377 --> 01:29:02.467
- I'm not that young.

1175
01:29:02.467 --> 01:29:05.209
Darling. it's a joke.

1176
01:29:14.436 --> 01:29:16.438
I suppose he abandoned you. too.

1177
01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:21.660
Well. why don't you join
our collection of lost things?

1178
01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:23.358
We need to look out
for each other.
