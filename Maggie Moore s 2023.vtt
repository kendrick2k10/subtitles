Pushed. you think?

12
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.217
Yeah. or jumped or fell.
but no blood up here. though.

13
00:01:50.252 --> 00:01:53.616
so she was shot down there.

14
00:01:53.651 --> 00:01:55.222
Pushed. jumped. or fell.

15
00:01:55.257 --> 00:01:57.224
Shot in the back of the
head. dragging herself away.

16
00:02:00.493 --> 00:02:01.525
My god. that's awful.

17
00:02:05.498 --> 00:02:08.202
I hope we didn't pull you
away from the lovely Rita.

18
00:02:08.237 --> 00:02:09.632
Is that how this
is going to go?

19
00:02:09.667 --> 00:02:11.634
Rita's sprinkled into
every conversation now?

20
00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:13.735
Oh. of course not.

21
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.803
Except yeah.

22
00:02:15.838 --> 00:02:19.136
But it's good. though.

23
00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:21.138
Last week. we would pulled
you away from. what.

24
00:02:21.173 --> 00:02:22.579
a can of soup and Jeopardy?

25
00:02:22.614 --> 00:02:23.976
You know what?

26
00:02:24.011 --> 00:02:25.219
There's nothing wrong
with soup and Jeopardy.

27
00:02:25.254 --> 00:02:26.715
They happen to
complement one another.

28
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.849
The vehicle's registered
to Maggie Moore.

29
00:02:28.884 --> 00:02:30.521
Lives a few miles from here.

30
00:02:30.556 --> 00:02:31.588
You sent Maggie Moore?

31
00:02:31.623 --> 00:02:32.589

33
00:02:53.612 --> 00:02:56.041
So. did she take the
ring back. your wife?

34
00:02:56.076 --> 00:02:57.713
Nope.

35
00:02:57.748 --> 00:02:59.583
Unbeknownst to me.. I entered
into a marriage contract.

36
00:02:59.618 --> 00:03:02.520
and she's entitled
to certain niceties.

37
00:03:02.555 --> 00:03:03.785
Niceties?

38
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.524
The fuck is that?

39
00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:07.789
What the hell. man?

40
00:03:07.824 --> 00:03:08.856
Oh. it's fine.

41
00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:09.692
You just cut it off.

42
00:03:09.727 --> 00:03:10.693
Yes. not fine.

43
00:03:10.728 --> 00:03:11.892
This is fucking mold.

44
00:03:11.927 --> 00:03:13.366
It's just not edible.

45
00:03:13.401 --> 00:03:15.401
You know. you're paying
me $0.20 on the dollar.

46
00:03:15.436 --> 00:03:16.732
It's eat-able enough.

47
00:03:16.767 --> 00:03:17.601
Edible.

48
00:03:17.636 --> 00:03:21.099
Edible enough. Jesus.

49
00:03:21.134 --> 00:03:23.277
Marriage contract--
that's a thing?

50
00:03:23.312 --> 00:03:24.872
Yeah.

51
00:03:24.907 --> 00:03:27.105
Her shrink says I promised
Maggie I'd make big money.

52
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.613
Fuck me if I'm running
behind schedule.

53
00:03:29.648 --> 00:03:31.142
But she bitches I'm
pinching pennies.

54
00:03:31.177 --> 00:03:33.551
I'm pinching fucking pennies.

55
00:03:33.586 --> 00:03:37.115
Try not buying $600 rings.
and let me get back on track.

56
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.215
Yeah. simple math.

57
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.459
Yes. simple math. right?

58
00:03:40.494 --> 00:03:42.428
But no. here I am.
serving up fucking

59
00:03:42.463 --> 00:03:45.794
expired food to make more money
to pay her shrink to tell her

60
00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:48.401
I'm pinching fucking pennies.

00:03:48.436 --> 00:03:50.095
Where's my shit?

We're having a conversation.

63
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.900
Yeah. you told me.

64
00:03:52.935 --> 00:03:54.033
Now. where's my shit?

65
00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:05.682
Don't tell me you lost it.

66
00:04:05.717 --> 00:04:07.079
That's some sensitive shit.

67
00:04:07.114 --> 00:04:07.684
Fuck me.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:24.162
Hey. Mags?

69
00:04:28.036 --> 00:04:28.639
Maggie?

70
00:04:40.752 --> 00:04:41.355
Mags!

71
00:04:46.923 --> 00:04:47.988
Hey. Mags.

72
00:04:48.023 --> 00:04:49.561
You OK?

73
00:04:49.596 --> 00:04:53.664
What kind of monster are you?

74
00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:57.162
Whatever that
is. it is not mine.

75
00:04:57.197 --> 00:04:57.899
You're lying.

76
00:04:57.934 --> 00:04:58.636
I'm not.
I'm not.

77
00:04:58.671 --> 00:04:59.802
I'm not.

78
00:04:59.837 --> 00:05:00.506
It's this work
guy. Tommy. Jesus.

79
00:05:00.541 --> 00:05:01.507
I swear to God.

80
00:05:01.542 --> 00:05:02.673
Don't you dare swear to God.

81
00:05:02.708 --> 00:05:05.170
You're not entitled
to swear to God.

82
00:05:05.205 --> 00:05:07.381
Jesus. what the
fuck is in there?

83
00:05:07.416 --> 00:05:13.343
Pictures of children.
of little children.

84
00:05:13.378 --> 00:05:15.048
Holy shit.

85
00:05:15.083 --> 00:05:18.018
I had nothing to do with that.
Maggie. and I mean nothing.

86
00:05:18.053 --> 00:05:19.723
I was just passing them along.

87
00:05:19.758 --> 00:05:24.321
MAGGIE: You brought this filth
into our home. into my home.

88
00:05:24.356 --> 00:05:25.894
Why do you have anything
to do with this freak?

89
00:05:25.929 --> 00:05:27.357
JAY: OK. he's a piece
of shit. all right?

90
00:05:27.392 --> 00:05:28.325
You think I don't know that?

91
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.535
But those are not mine.

92
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.702
You're providing them.

93
00:05:31.737 --> 00:05:35.068
This is a crime. and
you are an accessory!

94
00:05:35.103 --> 00:05:37.367
And that's if I
even believe you!

95
00:05:37.402 --> 00:05:39.611
What the fuck does that mean?

96
00:05:39.646 --> 00:05:41.415
You think I get
off on that shit?

97
00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.373
I don't know what
you get off on. Jay.

98
00:05:43.408 --> 00:05:44.946
JAY: It's just part of the deal.

99
00:05:44.981 --> 00:05:48.081
I pass along the packages.
and I get cheap food.

100
00:05:48.116 --> 00:05:49.588
If you can't figure
out how to make a buck.

101
00:05:49.623 --> 00:05:52.349
that's fine. but this?

102
00:05:52.384 --> 00:05:53.889
You need to leave!

104
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.353
Yeah!

00:05:56.388 --> 00:05:57.563
This is my house.
Maggie. and I'm not

106
00:05:57.598 --> 00:05:59.257

107
00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:00.599
I'm calling the cops.

108

Are you fucking insane?

Maggie found those
pictures. man.

116
00:06:36.637 --> 00:06:37.570
Oh. we had an agreement. man.

117
00:06:37.605 --> 00:06:38.736
My business is my business.

118
00:06:38.771 --> 00:06:39.935
Nobody told you to open it.

119
00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:40.969
Yeah. well. I didn't open it.

120
00:06:41.004 --> 00:06:41.805
Maggie opened it.

121
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.136
She threw me out.

122
00:06:43.171 --> 00:06:44.643
Oh. maybe she's using
that as an excuse.

123
00:06:44.678 --> 00:06:46.073
Maybe she's like
banging someone else.

124
00:06:46.108 --> 00:06:46.744
[grunting]
- What?

125
00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:48.009

127
00:06:49.518 --> 00:06:50.341
You're the one who should
be seeing a shrink.

128
00:06:50.376 --> 00:06:51.441
you fucking perv.

129
00:06:51.476 --> 00:06:52.409
What the hell is wrong with you?

130
00:06:52.444 --> 00:06:54.411
Hey. man. we had a deal.

131
00:06:54.446 --> 00:06:55.247
I do for you.

132
00:06:55.282 --> 00:06:56.248
Then you do for me.

133
00:06:56.283 --> 00:06:57.447
Now you take another side?

134
00:06:57.482 --> 00:06:59.119
That's fucking
Stockholm syndrome.

135
00:06:59.154 --> 00:07:00.824
OK. that is not Stockholm
syndrome. you fucking maniac.

136
00:07:00.859 --> 00:07:02.023
That's Stockholm syndrome.

137
00:07:02.058 --> 00:07:03.794
No. that is not
Stockholm syndrome.

138
00:07:03.829 --> 00:07:05.763
Stockholm syndrome is when you
get kidnapped and brainwashed.

139
00:07:05.798 --> 00:07:08.458
God damn it. are
you fucking thick?

140
00:07:08.493 --> 00:07:10.768
Oh. she's going to clean me out.

141
00:07:10.803 --> 00:07:11.428
So fucking what?

142
00:07:11.463 --> 00:07:12.363
Stay here. man.

143
00:07:12.398 --> 00:07:13.870
You got a can.

144
00:07:13.905 --> 00:07:16.708
You got a full kitchen.
hella meat. cheese. and--

145
00:07:16.743 --> 00:07:19.271
Oh. yeah. yeah. that's
my dream fucking scenario.

146
00:07:19.306 --> 00:07:21.548
Fuck. what if she goes to
the cops with those pictures?

147
00:07:21.583 --> 00:07:23.946
Then I'm an accessory
to your sick shit-- ah!

148
00:07:23.981 --> 00:07:24.518
Fuck!

149
00:07:24.553 --> 00:07:26.850
Ow!

150
00:07:26.885 --> 00:07:28.885
I got fucking plans. man!

151
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.888
So it's best to keep me
out of the situation!

152
00:07:31.923 --> 00:07:34.055
So if you need help getting
those pictures back.

153
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.322
which you better fucking
do. I know a guy.

154
00:07:39.898 --> 00:07:40.831
Ah!

155
00:07:40.866 --> 00:07:42.294
You understand?

156
00:07:42.329 --> 00:07:43.229
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

157
00:07:43.264 --> 00:07:43.966
I'll handle it.

158
00:07:44.001 --> 00:07:45.803
I'll handle it.

159
00:07:45.838 --> 00:07:48.168
Ah. oh.

160
00:07:48.203 --> 00:07:49.367
I want my fucking pictures!

161
00:07:53.241 --> 00:07:56.143
His life had taken
an unexpected turn.

162
00:07:56.178 --> 00:07:59.212
Every night. he ate a can
of soup in front of the TV.

163
00:07:59.247 --> 00:08:03.315
usually Jeopardy unless
a ballgame was on.

164
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:06.890
His friends would call. but
he didn't want to see them.

165
00:08:06.925 --> 00:08:09.354
He didn't want their
well meaning pity.

166
00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:12.423
But it wasn't just that.

167
00:08:12.458 --> 00:08:15.932
For years. he had
the perfect life.

168
00:08:15.967 --> 00:08:18.572
It was too hard for him
to admit it was over.

169
00:08:26.978 --> 00:08:29.110
So was that autobiographical?

170
00:08:29.145 --> 00:08:32.047
Oh. no. just madeup stuff.

171
00:08:32.082 --> 00:08:33.884
I thought it
was really moving.

172
00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:36.447
How long you been writing?

173
00:08:36.482 --> 00:08:38.086
I wouldn't really
call it writing.

174
00:08:38.121 --> 00:08:39.692
but I've been playing around
with it since high school.

175
00:08:39.727 --> 00:08:41.694
This high school. in fact.

176
00:08:41.729 --> 00:08:43.289
Huh.

177
00:08:43.324 --> 00:08:44.763
Here.

178
00:08:44.798 --> 00:08:46.523
Defacing public property.

179
00:08:46.558 --> 00:08:47.392
Wow.

180
00:08:47.427 --> 00:08:49.394
So you were a hooligan.

181
00:08:49.429 --> 00:08:51.561
Well. I have since reformed.

182
00:08:51.596 --> 00:08:54.102
Glad to hear it.

183
00:08:54.137 --> 00:08:59.811
Hey. I was going to grab
a coffee down the street

184
00:08:59.846 --> 00:09:01.241
if you want to join me maybe.

185
00:09:01.276 --> 00:09:03.045
Oh. uh--

186
00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.816
Come on.

187
00:09:04.851 --> 00:09:07.346
You'll be miserable for 20
minutes tops. I promise.

188
00:09:15.587 --> 00:09:18.555
You know. sometimes.
in conversation.

189
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:21.096
the other person might
ask. for instance.

190
00:09:21.131 --> 00:09:24.594
how long they've been writing.
you know. just as an example.

191
00:09:24.629 --> 00:09:26.563
Coincidentally.
I was just going

192
00:09:26.598 --> 00:09:30.468
to ask. even before
you mentioned that.

193
00:09:30.503 --> 00:09:32.239
how long have you been writing?

194
00:09:32.274 --> 00:09:35.847
Well. I got my first
diary on my 10th birthday

195
00:09:35.882 --> 00:09:39.950
and then tore through one
a month till I was 23.

196
00:09:39.985 --> 00:09:41.655
What happened to 23?

197
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:45.417
Mm. got married. had a child
two months later-- my parents

198
00:09:45.452 --> 00:09:47.023
not happy about that.

199
00:09:47.058 --> 00:09:51.060
And 12 years flew
by. and here I am.

200
00:09:57.002 --> 00:10:00.971
Uh. so you're
married with a kid?

201
00:10:01.006 --> 00:10:05.943
Mm. I'm separated
with two kids.

202
00:10:05.978 --> 00:10:08.275
So what about you?

203
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:12.180
What's your situation?

204
00:10:12.215 --> 00:10:13.346
No kids.

205
00:10:13.381 --> 00:10:14.050
No kids.

206
00:10:14.085 --> 00:10:16.822
My wife passed.

207
00:10:16.857 --> 00:10:20.056
Wow. I'm sorry.

208
00:10:20.091 --> 00:10:22.729
You know. life.

209
00:10:22.764 --> 00:10:24.797
It's what happens
while you're busy making

210
00:10:24.832 --> 00:10:29.901
other plans. which is not a
John Lennon quote. by the way.

211
00:10:29.936 --> 00:10:31.298
No. it is actually from a--

212
00:10:31.333 --> 00:10:33.740
[voice fading out]

213
00:10:33.775 --> 00:10:37.238
[leaf blower]

214
00:10:45.754 --> 00:10:46.511
Hey.

215
00:10:46.546 --> 00:10:47.644
Hey. Mags.

216
00:10:47.679 --> 00:10:49.217
I told you to stay away.

217
00:10:49.252 --> 00:10:50.922
I'm just getting it nice
and neat the way you like it.

218
00:10:50.957 --> 00:10:51.549
Come on.

219
00:10:51.584 --> 00:10:52.253
Come on.

220
00:10:52.288 --> 00:10:53.419
We got to talk.

221
00:10:53.454 --> 00:10:54.519
You're not answering the phone.

222
00:10:54.554 --> 00:10:55.553
Because I don't want to talk.

223
00:10:55.588 --> 00:10:56.829
You see how that works?

224
00:10:56.864 --> 00:10:58.655
And don't you dare
come by the diner.

225
00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:00.767
Hey. Mags. listen to me.

226
00:11:00.802 --> 00:11:02.769
Hey. listen.

227
00:11:02.804 --> 00:11:05.563
I know you're pissed. but
do not go to the cops.

228
00:11:05.598 --> 00:11:08.005
This guy. Tommy T.
he's a complete psycho.

229
00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.173
You go to the cops. I don't
know what he's going to do.

230
00:11:11.208 --> 00:11:12.240
To you or to me?

231
00:11:12.275 --> 00:11:14.572
You. me. both of us.

232
00:11:14.607 --> 00:11:16.673
But I'm worried about you.

233
00:11:16.708 --> 00:11:20.248
[scoffs] Fuck you. Jay!

234
00:11:20.283 --> 00:11:21.546
My lawyer's calling you.

235
00:11:21.581 --> 00:11:23.680
Waste your bullshit on her.

236
00:11:23.715 --> 00:11:26.287
You're calling a lawyer?

237
00:11:26.322 --> 00:11:27.761
Mags. come on.

238
00:11:27.796 --> 00:11:29.290
Mags!

239
00:11:29.325 --> 00:11:31.930
Seriously?

240
00:11:31.965 --> 00:11:35.527
What. did your shrink
tell you to do that?

241
00:11:35.562 --> 00:11:37.034
[gong]

242
00:11:37.069 --> 00:11:40.004
[asian music]

243
00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.277
You know. if you don't
mind. actually. I'm

244
00:11:49.312 --> 00:11:51.477
a little sore today. the
neck and shoulders area.

245
00:11:51.512 --> 00:11:52.643
Oh.

246
00:11:52.678 --> 00:11:54.282
First time for
everything. right?

247
00:11:54.317 --> 00:11:58.188
[chuckles] Yeah. I
got a lot of stress.

248
00:12:01.258 --> 00:12:04.754
Yeah. got a lot of decisions
to make that's going to affect

249
00:12:04.789 --> 00:12:09.000
my lifestyle. my
disposable income.

250
00:12:09.035 --> 00:12:11.904
You know Castle Subs.
Indian school in Highland?

251
00:12:11.939 --> 00:12:14.005
That was a sub place?

252
00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:18.570
Yeah. it's a sub
place. Castle Subs?

253
00:12:18.605 --> 00:12:21.177
I'm a franchisee.

254
00:12:21.212 --> 00:12:24.246
Just the one place for
now. but down the road.

255
00:12:24.281 --> 00:12:27.777
I imagine six. maybe
seven establishments.

256
00:12:27.812 --> 00:12:30.582
And then from there. you
know. sky's the limit.

257
00:12:30.617 --> 00:12:33.321
You know Howard Schultz?

258
00:12:33.356 --> 00:12:36.962
Starbucks guy. who
owns half the planet?

259
00:12:36.997 --> 00:12:39.360
I'm going to own the other half.

260
00:12:39.395 --> 00:12:40.592
Big dreams.

261
00:12:40.627 --> 00:12:42.297
What's stopping you?

262
00:12:42.332 --> 00:12:47.467
Nothing's stopping me. except
the potential legal impediment

263
00:12:47.502 --> 00:12:50.140
from my wife. of all people.

264
00:12:50.175 --> 00:12:52.670
Can you believe that?

265
00:12:52.705 --> 00:12:54.540
What would Starbucks guy do?

266
00:12:54.575 --> 00:12:57.543
[music playing]

267
00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.389
Hey. Tommy T. Set it up.

268
00:13:23.736 --> 00:13:26.704
[tv playing distantly]

269
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.368
[knocking]

270
00:13:53.403 --> 00:13:56.569
Mr. Cosco!

271
00:13:56.604 --> 00:13:59.572
[planes flying on tv]

272
00:14:25.798 --> 00:14:27.303
Pretty loud. don't you think?

273
00:14:33.245 --> 00:14:34.244
[tv stops]

274
00:14:39.988 --> 00:14:42.483
Tommy T fill you in?

275
00:14:42.518 --> 00:14:44.287
My situation. he explain it?

276
00:14:48.161 --> 00:14:50.524
What. you got
laryngitis or something?

277
00:14:53.199 --> 00:14:56.068
Oh. you're deaf?

278
00:14:56.103 --> 00:14:56.893
Seriously?

279
00:14:56.928 --> 00:14:57.597
You're fucking deaf?

280
00:15:02.472 --> 00:15:05.770
So-- so you read lips?

281
00:15:08.544 --> 00:15:12.018
Oh. Jesus. OK.

282
00:15:12.053 --> 00:15:13.349
[shredding]

283
00:15:13.384 --> 00:15:16.484
Yeah. smart.

284
00:15:16.519 --> 00:15:17.518
No paper trail.

285
00:15:17.553 --> 00:15:18.354
I like that.

286
00:15:22.393 --> 00:15:31.367
OK. so. uh. my wife.
she is threatening

287
00:15:31.402 --> 00:15:34.634
to go to the cops over
some shit that Tommy T got

288
00:15:34.669 --> 00:15:36.867
involved with-- no judgment.

289
00:15:36.902 --> 00:15:42.279
So basically what I would
like from you is to scare her

290
00:15:42.314 --> 00:15:48.351
off the idea. which. you know.
ultimately is for the best

291
00:15:48.386 --> 00:15:52.190
because you know Tommy
T is no fucking angel.

292
00:15:56.988 --> 00:16:00.066
So that's why you didn't know
the TV was so fucking loud.

293
00:16:03.566 --> 00:16:05.896
As soon as possible.

294
00:16:05.931 --> 00:16:09.372
Yeah. you're really
doing me a solid. man.

295
00:16:09.407 --> 00:16:10.967
So tell you what?

296
00:16:11.002 --> 00:16:13.244
Free food at my
sub shop for life.

297
00:16:15.776 --> 00:16:16.742
It's a perk.

298
00:16:16.777 --> 00:16:18.216
You know. not like your fee.

299
00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:27.885
[shredding]

300
00:16:32.364 --> 00:16:35.728
And let me get a mega bowl.

301
00:16:35.763 --> 00:16:38.566
Ugh. can you even
imagine this much money?

302
00:16:38.601 --> 00:16:40.073
I wouldn't even
know where to start.

303
00:16:40.108 --> 00:16:41.569
Pretty sure the
taxes on the lump sum

304
00:16:41.604 --> 00:16:44.341
are like half. though. right?

305
00:16:44.376 --> 00:16:45.705
Yeah. I don't know.

306
00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.674
Yeah. pretty sure they are.

307
00:16:47.709 --> 00:16:51.249
I mean. I could live OK on
$100 million. though. right?

308
00:16:51.284 --> 00:16:52.041
What was the number?

309
00:16:52.076 --> 00:16:53.944
I just want to pay.

310
00:16:53.979 --> 00:16:55.880
No. you don't want to
miss out on these rewards.

311
00:16:55.915 --> 00:16:57.948
What's your phone?

312
00:16:57.983 --> 00:17:04.460
928-965-2541.

313
00:17:04.495 --> 00:17:06.231
Maggie Moore.

314
00:17:06.266 --> 00:17:07.793
JAY: My wife.

315
00:17:07.828 --> 00:17:09.531
Got it.

316
00:17:09.566 --> 00:17:11.368
Would you like to add your
name to the loyalty membership?

317
00:17:11.403 --> 00:17:12.600
Nope.

318
00:17:12.635 --> 00:17:13.766
OK. then we'll keep
it just your wife

319
00:17:13.801 --> 00:17:15.735
then on Hanover Court.

320
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:18.111
Chip reader's not working
so you can just slide.

321
00:17:18.146 --> 00:17:22.071
Wait. we don't live
on Hanover Court.

322
00:17:22.106 --> 00:17:24.612
Yep. 32 Hanover Court.

323
00:17:24.647 --> 00:17:26.317
Nope. we live on Donna Circle.

324
00:17:26.352 --> 00:17:26.878
You know what?

325
00:17:26.913 --> 00:17:27.747
Forget it.

326
00:17:27.782 --> 00:17:28.484
Just forget the loyalty.

327
00:17:28.519 --> 00:17:29.122
Wait.

328
00:17:29.157 --> 00:17:30.255
Oh.

329
00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:31.949
Oh. I see.

330
00:17:31.984 --> 00:17:34.127
There's two Maggie Moores in
the system. the one at Hanover

331
00:17:34.162 --> 00:17:35.656
and then you guys on Donna.

332
00:17:35.691 --> 00:17:38.395
And then somehow the system
just like-- oh. wait.

333
00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:40.793
No. it didn't switch it.

334
00:17:40.828 --> 00:17:42.267
It's just under that one phone.

335
00:17:42.302 --> 00:17:44.137
That is so weird.

336
00:17:44.172 --> 00:17:45.028
I wonder how that happened.

337
00:17:48.704 --> 00:17:50.902
You never finished
telling me about your date.

338
00:17:50.937 --> 00:17:52.178
the co-ed from class.

339
00:17:55.645 --> 00:17:57.249
OK. first of all.
it wasn't a date.

340
00:17:57.284 --> 00:18:00.417
And second of all. she's a
grown woman with two kids.

341
00:18:00.452 --> 00:18:02.155
OK. what's wrong with that?

342
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:03.651
I didn't say anything
was wrong with her.

343
00:18:06.656 --> 00:18:08.084
OK. this is going
to sound weird--

344
00:18:08.119 --> 00:18:10.196
I mean really sound weird.

345
00:18:10.231 --> 00:18:11.527
Lay it on me.

346
00:18:11.562 --> 00:18:12.957
Lay it on me?

347
00:18:12.992 --> 00:18:14.464
What are you?

348
00:18:14.499 --> 00:18:15.663
You're in the
States for 10 years.

349
00:18:15.698 --> 00:18:17.126
and that's what you pick up?

350
00:18:17.161 --> 00:18:19.535
You're deflecting.

351
00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:21.834
OK.

352
00:18:21.869 --> 00:18:24.342
Oh. god. we went
and had cheesecake

353
00:18:24.377 --> 00:18:25.607
at this place near class.

354
00:18:25.642 --> 00:18:28.104
She paid. and you
felt like a wuss.

355
00:18:28.139 --> 00:18:30.315
You're right. that's
really stupid.

356
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:32.108
No. that is not what happened.

357
00:18:32.143 --> 00:18:36.112
She had cheesecake on her chin.
a little crumb of cheesecake.

358
00:18:36.147 --> 00:18:38.191
She had a little crumb
of cheesecake on her chin.

359
00:18:38.226 --> 00:18:39.852
and you found that unforgivable.

360
00:18:39.887 --> 00:18:41.392
Yeah. it just sat
there the whole time.

361
00:18:41.427 --> 00:18:43.955
Why didn't you
just lick it off?

362
00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:44.989
Too forward?

363
00:18:45.024 --> 00:18:47.464
Like a napkin?

364
00:18:47.499 --> 00:18:48.861
A gentle wipe?

365
00:18:48.896 --> 00:18:51.028
Look. you asked me how
it went. and I told you.

366
00:18:51.063 --> 00:18:51.798
OK?

367
00:18:51.833 --> 00:18:53.734
Done. there. fine.

368
00:18:53.769 --> 00:18:55.505
OK.

369
00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:56.836
But you understand this alleged
crumb as a reason to shut down

370
00:18:56.871 --> 00:19:00.378
a relationship is not rational.

371
00:19:00.413 --> 00:19:03.249
It's not.

372
00:19:03.284 --> 00:19:05.350
And when I say that it's
not rational. what I mean

373
00:19:05.385 --> 00:19:06.945
is there's something
terribly wrong with you.

374
00:19:12.458 --> 00:19:13.523
Morning.

375
00:19:13.558 --> 00:19:15.822
Hey. Rita.

376
00:19:15.857 --> 00:19:17.054
I haven't seen Jay around.

377
00:19:17.089 --> 00:19:18.396
I'm really late for work.

378
00:19:18.431 --> 00:19:19.331
Oh. sure.

379
00:19:19.366 --> 00:19:21.762
But we're not--

380
00:19:21.797 --> 00:19:24.270
Jay and I aren't going
to be together anymore.

381
00:19:24.305 --> 00:19:25.601
Oh. my goodness.

382
00:19:25.636 --> 00:19:29.242
Yeah. I mean. please
don't say anything.

383
00:19:29.277 --> 00:19:30.375
It's not for publication.

384
00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:31.904
No. no. of course.

385
00:19:31.939 --> 00:19:33.279
It's just like they
become completely

386
00:19:33.314 --> 00:19:35.204
different people. you know?

387
00:19:35.239 --> 00:19:35.776
I do.

388
00:19:35.811 --> 00:19:37.206
I do know.

389
00:19:37.241 --> 00:19:38.449
Save a lot of trouble
if they just told you

390
00:19:38.484 --> 00:19:40.682
their weirdo crap at the start.

391
00:19:40.717 --> 00:19:44.554
Anyway. I got to scoot.

392
00:19:44.589 --> 00:19:46.083
Hey. knock when you get back.

393
00:19:46.118 --> 00:19:49.020
We can open a wine
and have girl talk.

394
00:19:49.055 --> 00:19:50.791
Sorry. what?

395
00:19:50.826 --> 00:19:52.122
Have a great day.

396
00:19:52.157 --> 00:19:54.531
Take care.

397
00:19:54.566 --> 00:19:57.567
[music playing]

398
00:20:12.947 --> 00:20:13.913
[dramatic music]

399
00:20:13.948 --> 00:20:14.947
[gasps] Oh!

400
00:20:17.919 --> 00:20:19.886
Oh. please.

401
00:20:19.921 --> 00:20:21.723
Please don't hurt me.

402
00:20:21.758 --> 00:20:22.361
Please.

403
00:20:26.796 --> 00:20:28.730
Please don't hurt me.

404
00:20:28.765 --> 00:20:29.698
Please don't.

405
00:20:37.609 --> 00:20:40.511
[phone ringing]

406
00:20:45.485 --> 00:20:46.682
Castle.

407
00:20:46.717 --> 00:20:47.683
JERRY CONNORS (ON
PHONE): Mr. Moore.

408
00:20:47.718 --> 00:20:49.245
Jerry Connors of corporate.

409
00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.456
You focused on the
operation over there?

410
00:20:51.491 --> 00:20:52.457
What?

411
00:20:52.492 --> 00:20:53.854
Uh. yeah. of course. we are.

412
00:20:53.889 --> 00:20:55.625
JERRY CONNORS (ON
PHONE): Because according

413
00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.661
to our records. it's been. it
looks like. over three months

414
00:20:58.696 --> 00:21:00.531
since you purchased
any inventory--

415
00:21:00.566 --> 00:21:03.963
meats. cheese. chips. produce.
the fresh cookie dough.

416
00:21:03.998 --> 00:21:05.932
Yeah. yeah. yeah.
you know. I must

417
00:21:05.967 --> 00:21:08.605
have overbought at some
point because we got plenty.

418
00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.343
We are fully stocked.

419
00:21:10.378 --> 00:21:12.169
JERRY CONNORS (ON PHONE): Are
you saying you're still using

420
00:21:12.204 --> 00:21:13.808
product from three months ago?

421
00:21:13.843 --> 00:21:15.546
No. no. no. no. no. no. no.

422
00:21:15.581 --> 00:21:17.878
You must be missing a couple
orders because our stuff

423
00:21:17.913 --> 00:21:19.143
is beautiful. fresh as can be.

424
00:21:19.178 --> 00:21:20.782
JERRY CONNORS (ON
PHONE): Mr. Moore.

425
00:21:20.817 --> 00:21:23.620
are you checking the expiration
dates on the packaging?

426
00:21:23.655 --> 00:21:25.457
Yeah. absolutely. every day.

427
00:21:25.492 --> 00:21:29.054
You know. Mr. Connors. we have
got customers out the door.

428
00:21:29.089 --> 00:21:31.320
but we will be
reordering very soon.

429
00:21:31.355 --> 00:21:32.794
I can promise you that.

430
00:21:32.829 --> 00:21:35.533
Hey. this one is
pretty gross. too.

431
00:21:35.568 --> 00:21:38.635
OK. Greg. well.
toss it and move on.

432
00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:41.066
Can you figure that out?

433
00:21:41.101 --> 00:21:44.069
[music playing]

434
00:22:01.055 --> 00:22:01.856
Hey. Shel.

435
00:22:01.891 --> 00:22:03.220
Mags in the kitchen?

436
00:22:03.255 --> 00:22:04.661
Heard you had quite
the knockdown dragout.

437
00:22:04.696 --> 00:22:06.058
It's a misunderstanding.

438
00:22:06.093 --> 00:22:06.927
Is she in the kitchen?

439
00:22:06.962 --> 00:22:08.434
54 is your change.

440
00:22:08.469 --> 00:22:09.567
Thank you.

441
00:22:09.602 --> 00:22:10.568
She didn't come
in. and she didn't

442
00:22:10.603 --> 00:22:12.702
call. which is not like her.

443
00:22:12.737 --> 00:22:16.101
Yeah. she's not answering
her cell phone either.

444
00:22:16.136 --> 00:22:17.003
You worried?

445
00:22:17.038 --> 00:22:18.268
Yeah. getting to be.

446
00:22:18.303 --> 00:22:19.709
If she checks in.
can you ever give me

447
00:22:19.744 --> 00:22:21.271
a call or text me or something?

448
00:22:21.306 --> 00:22:24.175
OK.

449
00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:25.781
Hi. how's everything?

450
00:22:25.816 --> 00:22:27.552
DISPATCH (ON RADIO):
Hey. I got a couple

451
00:22:27.587 --> 00:22:30.621
of calls about the fire up the
B Line and Sycamore trailhead.

452
00:22:30.656 --> 00:22:33.217
It's probably just some
idiot burning leaves.

453
00:22:33.252 --> 00:22:34.317
Give it a look. will you?

454
00:23:13.292 --> 00:23:14.291
Well. that's not good.

455
00:23:20.299 --> 00:23:21.639
I don't know.

456
00:23:21.674 --> 00:23:23.267
Gas leak or
something electrical.

457
00:23:23.302 --> 00:23:27.810
You'd think there'd be
time to go out of the car.

458
00:23:27.845 --> 00:23:30.549
Unless. you know.
spontaneous combustion.

459
00:23:33.378 --> 00:23:34.520
So let me get this straight.

460
00:23:34.555 --> 00:23:36.753
In your scenario
here. this person

461
00:23:36.788 --> 00:23:39.690
drives off the highway down
some random embankment.

462
00:23:39.725 --> 00:23:42.924
stops here. and spontaneously
bursts into flames?

463
00:23:42.959 --> 00:23:44.189
Can't even tell you the sex.

464
00:23:44.224 --> 00:23:45.696
Too badly burned.

465
00:23:45.731 --> 00:23:47.533
An accelerant was used.
though. and plenty of it.

466
00:23:47.568 --> 00:23:51.537
Ah. so not
spontaneous combustion.

467
00:23:51.572 --> 00:23:53.429
I'll get you
more from the lab.

468
00:23:53.464 --> 00:23:54.034
Thank you.

469
00:23:58.843 --> 00:24:02.174
You know. KB. that was
a person who died there.

470
00:24:02.209 --> 00:24:05.848
murdered in a horrible.
horrible fashion.

471
00:24:05.883 --> 00:24:06.882
I know.

472
00:24:06.917 --> 00:24:08.653
Why do you got to make jokes?

473
00:24:08.688 --> 00:24:09.478
It's not right.

474
00:24:09.513 --> 00:24:10.215
It's not respectful.

475
00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:12.019
Don't do it. OK?

476
00:24:12.054 --> 00:24:13.218
Yeah.

477
00:24:13.253 --> 00:24:14.989
Did you pull a
VIN off the car?

478
00:24:15.024 --> 00:24:16.958
No. dash and doors too melted.

479
00:24:16.993 --> 00:24:18.454
Did you check the battery?

480
00:24:18.489 --> 00:24:20.764
Sometimes there's a
serial number plate.

481
00:24:25.166 --> 00:24:26.198
Yeah. see?

482
00:24:26.233 --> 00:24:26.902
There.

483
00:24:26.937 --> 00:24:27.496
Yeah.

484
00:24:27.531 --> 00:24:29.135
Run that.

485
00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:31.907
Also. call around all
the taxicab companies--

486
00:24:31.942 --> 00:24:35.042
Uber. Lyft. places like that.

487
00:24:35.077 --> 00:24:37.308
See if they had any
pickups around here

488
00:24:37.343 --> 00:24:39.343
'cause I don't see our guy
hitchhiking out of here.

489
00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.128
[knocking]

490
00:25:02.643 --> 00:25:04.269
Mr. Moore?

491
00:25:04.304 --> 00:25:05.435
Can I help you?

492
00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:08.438
Oh. uh. yeah.

493
00:25:08.473 --> 00:25:11.375
I'm looking for Jay Moore.

494
00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:12.684
I don't think he's here.

495
00:25:12.719 --> 00:25:13.850
I mean. he's not here.

496
00:25:13.885 --> 00:25:15.412
They're separated.

497
00:25:15.447 --> 00:25:17.051
Oh.

498
00:25:17.086 --> 00:25:19.284
Big fight.

499
00:25:19.319 --> 00:25:20.758
Yeah?

500
00:25:20.793 --> 00:25:21.418
Huge.

501
00:25:25.325 --> 00:25:28.095
You know. this is
really not necessary.

502
00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:29.932
Well. you don't
want to watch me eat.

503
00:25:32.673 --> 00:25:33.529
OK.

504
00:25:33.564 --> 00:25:36.037
Well. thank you.

505
00:25:36.072 --> 00:25:37.368
So what can you tell
me about this fight?

506
00:25:37.403 --> 00:25:38.710
Were you over there?

507
00:25:38.745 --> 00:25:40.646
Uh. no. no. no. here.

508
00:25:40.681 --> 00:25:42.373
I don't know.

509
00:25:42.408 --> 00:25:45.750
I guess sound must carry at
night. but they were just--

510
00:25:45.785 --> 00:25:47.213
man. they were
really going at it.

511
00:25:47.248 --> 00:25:48.819
Do they fight a lot?

512
00:25:48.854 --> 00:25:50.821
More so lately.

513
00:25:50.856 --> 00:25:53.725
Oh. did Maggie file
a restraining order?

514
00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.320
Is that why you're here?

515
00:25:55.355 --> 00:25:57.729
Can't say.

516
00:25:57.764 --> 00:26:01.293
But maybe did you hear
anything specific about what

517
00:26:01.328 --> 00:26:02.635
they were fighting about?

518
00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:06.298
I mean. it was
pretty garbled. but she

519
00:26:06.333 --> 00:26:08.069
did yell the word "filth."

520
00:26:08.104 --> 00:26:10.401
I caught that.

521
00:26:10.436 --> 00:26:11.644
Filth.

522
00:26:11.679 --> 00:26:13.910
And then he was banished.

523
00:26:13.945 --> 00:26:16.110
He did come back one
day to work on the lawn.

524
00:26:16.145 --> 00:26:17.683
and that did not go over well.

525
00:26:17.718 --> 00:26:19.476
[coughing]

526
00:26:19.511 --> 00:26:20.444
Oh. no.

527
00:26:20.479 --> 00:26:21.313
Was there too much pepper?

528
00:26:21.348 --> 00:26:22.017
Wow.

529
00:26:22.052 --> 00:26:22.952
You want milk?

530
00:26:22.987 --> 00:26:23.986
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

531
00:26:24.021 --> 00:26:24.954
Please. please. please sit.

532
00:26:24.989 --> 00:26:25.988
I'm fine.

533
00:26:26.023 --> 00:26:27.957
It just caught me by surprise.

534
00:26:27.992 --> 00:26:30.828
I have this sick
thing for pepper.

535
00:26:30.863 --> 00:26:32.291
Mm.

536
00:26:32.326 --> 00:26:32.995
No. I get it.

537
00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:34.326
I get it.

538
00:26:34.361 --> 00:26:36.966
My wife. we have one
spice in our home.

539
00:26:37.001 --> 00:26:38.627
It's garlic salt. She
puts it on everything--

540
00:26:38.662 --> 00:26:41.674
steak. hamburger. cereal.

541
00:26:41.709 --> 00:26:42.708
I'm kidding. of course.

542
00:26:42.743 --> 00:26:43.709
She would never put it on steak.

543
00:26:43.744 --> 00:26:46.712
[laughs] OK.

544
00:26:46.747 --> 00:26:50.507
Well. you know. you're welcome
to take the shaker home

545
00:26:50.542 --> 00:26:52.113
and show her what
she's been missing.

546
00:26:52.148 --> 00:26:55.347
Uh. yeah.

547
00:26:55.382 --> 00:26:58.922
She passed away
about a year ago.

548
00:27:01.828 --> 00:27:03.487
Oh. I'm sorry about that.

549
00:27:07.592 --> 00:27:09.735
I'm divorced if you
were wondering why I drag

550
00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:12.199
strangers in to eat with me.

551
00:27:12.234 --> 00:27:14.498
[laughs] Well. you
must have friends.

552
00:27:14.533 --> 00:27:16.071
Oh. god. no.

553
00:27:16.106 --> 00:27:19.206
They all chose him. and frankly.
I can't make the effort.

554
00:27:19.241 --> 00:27:20.977
I've been trying to
pal up to Maggie.

555
00:27:21.012 --> 00:27:22.539
We'll see where that goes.

556
00:27:22.574 --> 00:27:23.507
She seems nice.

557
00:27:23.542 --> 00:27:25.850
Her husband's a little off.

558
00:27:25.885 --> 00:27:29.546
I'm finding it takes courage
to be happy. you know?

559
00:27:29.581 --> 00:27:31.449
I'm just not sure my
ex left me with any.

560
00:27:36.456 --> 00:27:37.092
I don't know.

561
00:27:37.127 --> 00:27:39.160
I bet you--

562
00:27:39.195 --> 00:27:41.228
I bet you have plenty.

563
00:27:41.263 --> 00:27:43.230
No. he broke me
down pretty good.

564
00:27:43.265 --> 00:27:48.741
[laughs]

565
00:27:48.776 --> 00:27:52.272
Well. where do
you think I might

566
00:27:52.307 --> 00:27:54.604
be able to find Jay Moore?

567
00:27:54.639 --> 00:27:55.847
Come on. man.

568
00:27:55.882 --> 00:27:57.013
It's my prom.

569
00:27:57.048 --> 00:27:59.213
Yeah. and prom's
a huge night for us.

570
00:27:59.248 --> 00:28:01.545
Yeah. but like who eats subs?

571
00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:04.581
Anyway. like. we're all dressed
up to go to real restaurants.

572
00:28:04.616 --> 00:28:05.791
Yeah. and you smoke weed.

573
00:28:05.826 --> 00:28:08.387
You get wasted and unpacked.

574
00:28:08.422 --> 00:28:09.190
Sorry. Greg.

575
00:28:09.225 --> 00:28:10.961
I can't spare you.

576
00:28:10.996 --> 00:28:12.424
[knocking]

577
00:28:24.273 --> 00:28:24.876
Hey there. officer.

578
00:28:24.911 --> 00:28:25.536
Mr. Moore.

579
00:28:25.571 --> 00:28:26.735
Yeah. yeah.

580
00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:27.472
Mind if I talk to
you for a second?

581
00:28:27.507 --> 00:28:27.978
Yeah. of course.

582
00:28:31.115 --> 00:28:31.949
No. no.

583
00:28:31.984 --> 00:28:33.445
No. that can't be right.

584
00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.118
It's possible there's
a mistake. no?

585
00:28:36.153 --> 00:28:37.713
When was the last
time you saw your wife?

586
00:28:37.748 --> 00:28:41.552
I was just over
to work on the yard.

587
00:28:41.587 --> 00:28:44.489
So you two were
living separately then?

588
00:28:44.524 --> 00:28:48.328
We had like a stupid
fight. and I tried

589
00:28:48.363 --> 00:28:49.835
calling her today to apologize.

590
00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:52.596
I even went to the diner
where she works. you know.

591
00:28:52.631 --> 00:28:56.765
trying to make up.

592
00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.767
Who would do this?

593
00:28:58.802 --> 00:29:02.078
Everybody just loved Mags.

594
00:29:02.113 --> 00:29:03.508
She was a rock star.

595
00:29:08.053 --> 00:29:10.779
We'll find out
sooner or later.

596
00:29:10.814 --> 00:29:11.516
We always do.

597
00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:16.356
I'm very sorry for
your loss. Mr. Moore.

598
00:29:24.135 --> 00:29:25.266
I'm sorry for your loss.

599
00:29:25.301 --> 00:29:29.006
[door banging open]

600
00:29:29.041 --> 00:29:30.007
TOMMY T (ON PHONE): What's up?

601
00:29:30.042 --> 00:29:31.371
He fucking killed her.

602
00:29:31.406 --> 00:29:32.273
Who's this?

603
00:29:32.308 --> 00:29:33.307
Jay?

604
00:29:33.342 --> 00:29:34.946
Chief of police was just here.

605
00:29:34.981 --> 00:29:36.046
Jesus fucking Christ.

606
00:29:36.081 --> 00:29:37.278
They're going to
nail me for this.

607
00:29:37.313 --> 00:29:38.807
You understand?

608
00:29:38.842 --> 00:29:40.644
That's what's up. dude.
but you know. there's still

609
00:29:40.679 --> 00:29:42.811
the matter of my finder's fee.

610
00:29:42.846 --> 00:29:44.285
What?

611
00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:45.682
What did you just say?

612
00:29:45.717 --> 00:29:47.519
I mean. look. I
get things went awry.

613
00:29:47.554 --> 00:29:48.289
But--

614
00:29:48.324 --> 00:29:49.862
Things went awry?

615
00:29:49.897 --> 00:29:53.965
He burned Maggie up
in her fucking car!

616
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.167
Yeah. I hear you. dude.
but business is business.

617
00:29:58.202 --> 00:29:59.498
Fuck you!

618
00:29:59.533 --> 00:30:00.631
Fuck you!

619
00:30:00.666 --> 00:30:01.467
[banging]

620
00:30:01.502 --> 00:30:02.039
Fuck you!

621
00:30:02.074 --> 00:30:02.908
Fuck you!

622
00:30:02.943 --> 00:30:03.535
Fuck!

623
00:30:12.711 --> 00:30:13.611
Piece of shit phone.

624
00:30:22.259 --> 00:30:24.589
So you're telling me that
even if the potato chips or what

625
00:30:24.624 --> 00:30:26.558
have you are cheaper
somewhere else. that they have

626
00:30:26.593 --> 00:30:28.934
to buy Castle Subs products?

627
00:30:28.969 --> 00:30:30.595
JERRY CONNORS (ON PHONE):
That's right. officer.

628
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:31.827
OK. got it.

629
00:30:31.862 --> 00:30:33.400
Thank you for your
time. Mr. Connors.

630
00:30:33.435 --> 00:30:34.731
JERRY CONNORS (ON
PHONE): My pleasure.

631
00:30:37.076 --> 00:30:39.538
Well. Jay Moore
is into something.

632
00:30:39.573 --> 00:30:42.079
Because he's selling
shitty no name chips?

633
00:30:42.114 --> 00:30:44.609
It's a breach of the
franchise agreement.

634
00:30:44.644 --> 00:30:47.117
He has to buy
Castle Subs product.

635
00:30:47.152 --> 00:30:49.581
If he buys from Liberty
Bell foods or wherever else.

636
00:30:49.616 --> 00:30:51.583
he stiffs corporate
out of their money.

637
00:30:51.618 --> 00:30:53.882
Either way. what's that got
to do with his murdered wife?

638
00:30:53.917 --> 00:30:55.389
I do not know.

639
00:30:55.424 --> 00:30:57.061
Because you seem really
worked up over this.

640
00:30:57.096 --> 00:30:59.888
Well. we have a victim who
was unable to yield any clues

641
00:30:59.923 --> 00:31:01.395
due to her--

642
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:03.463
Crispiness.

643
00:31:03.498 --> 00:31:04.134
Christ's sakes.

644
00:31:04.169 --> 00:31:05.762
KB. will you--

645
00:31:05.797 --> 00:31:08.270
Sorry. it just happens.

646
00:31:08.305 --> 00:31:10.041
Don't do it anymore.

647
00:31:10.076 --> 00:31:12.571
What do you got?

648
00:31:12.606 --> 00:31:14.738
Called all the
transport companies.

649
00:31:14.773 --> 00:31:16.311
No one had a pickup
near the B Line.

650
00:31:16.346 --> 00:31:19.644
Also Jay's story checks
out at the diner.

651
00:31:19.679 --> 00:31:22.086
Also there's a record of
his call to Maggie's cell.

652
00:31:22.121 --> 00:31:24.055
just like he told you.

653
00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:25.122
So we've got nothing.

654
00:31:27.918 --> 00:31:29.995
Hey. two Maggie Moores guy.

655
00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:31.997
[bell]

656
00:31:33.429 --> 00:31:34.758
Uh. what?

657
00:31:34.793 --> 00:31:36.430
Two Maggie Moores
in the system. one

658
00:31:36.465 --> 00:31:38.465
at 32 Hanover.
you guys on Donna.

659
00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:39.268
Remember?

660
00:31:39.303 --> 00:31:40.467
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

661
00:31:40.502 --> 00:31:42.766
Dude. what a
crazy coincidence.

662
00:31:42.801 --> 00:31:45.307
[scoffs] What are
the odds of that?

663
00:31:49.115 --> 00:31:51.511
Mr. Moore.

664
00:31:51.546 --> 00:31:53.678
Mr. Moore.

665
00:31:53.713 --> 00:31:54.646
Mr. Moore.

666
00:31:54.681 --> 00:31:56.351
[bell]

667
00:31:56.386 --> 00:31:58.089
Yeah.

668
00:31:58.124 --> 00:32:01.323
Yeah. let me get a mega bowl
and a couple of those phones.

669
00:32:10.631 --> 00:32:14.204
No. it was weird for me to see
my name in a story like that.

670
00:32:14.239 --> 00:32:16.206
Mags. you seen my glasses?

671
00:32:16.241 --> 00:32:18.538
In here!

672
00:32:18.573 --> 00:32:20.045
Well. tell Daddy that I'm fine.

673
00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:22.806
It was just one of those
spooky coincidences. OK?

674
00:32:22.841 --> 00:32:24.478
So I'll see you on Tuesday. Mom.

675
00:32:24.513 --> 00:32:26.447
OK. I love you. too.

676
00:32:26.482 --> 00:32:28.152
OK. bye.

677
00:32:28.187 --> 00:32:30.022
Your folks OK?

678
00:32:30.057 --> 00:32:32.057
Yeah. I talked them down.

679
00:32:32.092 --> 00:32:35.060
[music playing]

680
00:33:42.085 --> 00:33:43.293
Hey. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa!

681
00:33:43.328 --> 00:33:43.887
It's me.

682
00:33:43.922 --> 00:33:44.492
It's me.

683
00:33:51.897 --> 00:33:54.238
[tv playing loudly]

684
00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:58.473
Why is it--

685
00:33:58.508 --> 00:33:59.111
[tv shutting off]

686
00:33:59.146 --> 00:34:00.112

687
00:34:00.147 --> 00:34:01.036
Jesus!

688
00:34:01.071 --> 00:34:02.004
OK. sorry.

689
00:34:05.009 --> 00:34:08.043
MAN (ON TV): Let me
take a whack at it.

690
00:34:08.078 --> 00:34:09.319
Demented fuck.

691
00:34:14.986 --> 00:34:21.727
So. just asking. no disrespect.
because I know you're like--

692
00:34:21.762 --> 00:34:26.567
but I pretty clearly said
scare her. not. you know.

693
00:34:26.602 --> 00:34:29.339
set her on fucking fire.

694
00:34:29.374 --> 00:34:40.185
So like-- yeah.

695
00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:41.450
Yeah. that sounds like Maggie.

696
00:34:41.485 --> 00:34:44.112
Jesus Christ.

697
00:34:44.147 --> 00:34:47.654
So was she. like.
alive when you--

698
00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:51.955
Well. thank God for that.

699
00:34:55.059 --> 00:34:57.862
So I got the cops fucking
knocking on my door. man.

700
00:34:57.897 --> 00:35:00.271
So I got a plan.

701
00:35:00.306 --> 00:35:02.031
You know my wife's
name. Maggie. right?

702
00:35:02.066 --> 00:35:04.275
Maggie Moore.

703
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:07.135
Well. there's another Maggie
Moore. same exact fucking name.

704
00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:09.214
only a couple of miles away.

705
00:35:09.249 --> 00:35:15.352
So what I'm thinking
is if we-- you--

706
00:35:15.387 --> 00:35:19.114
remove the second
Maggie Moore. it'll

707
00:35:19.149 --> 00:35:22.623
make it look like the
first removal. my Maggie.

708
00:35:22.658 --> 00:35:26.121
was just a mistake.
like it was an accident.

709
00:35:26.156 --> 00:35:27.056
And I'm off the hook.

710
00:35:31.865 --> 00:35:35.339
I mean. they're not twins. but.

711
00:35:38.839 --> 00:35:39.409
Yeah?

712
00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:55.326
You didn't say anything
about me. right?

713
00:35:55.361 --> 00:35:55.953
To Maggie?

714
00:36:08.704 --> 00:36:10.770
Fuck.

715
00:36:10.805 --> 00:36:13.245
What the hell?

716
00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.708
Why would you tell her that?

717
00:36:14.743 --> 00:36:15.940
[shredding]

718
00:36:15.975 --> 00:36:16.875
Jesus Christ.

719
00:36:22.146 --> 00:36:26.291
PASTOR: Maggie. as you
all know. loved children.

720
00:36:26.326 --> 00:36:29.591
but not having been blessed
with children of her own.

721
00:36:29.626 --> 00:36:33.298
she feared her life
would be without meaning.

722
00:36:33.333 --> 00:36:35.223
It was not.

723
00:36:35.258 --> 00:36:37.093
Maggie was able to
find new meaning

724
00:36:37.128 --> 00:36:39.304
through her work at the diner.

725
00:36:39.339 --> 00:36:40.899
Why are you making me do this?

726
00:36:40.934 --> 00:36:42.736
Why do you make me
interrupt my route to come

727
00:36:42.771 --> 00:36:44.804
here to get what's mine. huh?

728
00:36:44.839 --> 00:36:46.707
Finder's fee ain't much.
not the way you were talking

729
00:36:46.742 --> 00:36:47.774
what a divorce would cost.

730
00:36:50.614 --> 00:36:51.448
Come on. man.

731
00:36:51.483 --> 00:36:52.779
I got to be the pastor.

732
00:36:52.814 --> 00:36:54.715
Right. because otherwise
you'll go to hell.

733
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:55.980
Like. that's why you'll go.

734
00:37:08.764 --> 00:37:10.896
PASTOR: --and the truth of our
relationships with our friends

735
00:37:10.931 --> 00:37:15.670
and loved ones. the
truth within ourselves.

736
00:37:15.705 --> 00:37:19.740
You see. life is not about
the houses we live in.

737
00:37:19.775 --> 00:37:23.645
the cars we drive.
or the money we make.

738
00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:26.318
In times like these.
we realize that only

739
00:37:26.353 --> 00:37:28.749
three things truly matter--

740
00:37:28.784 --> 00:37:32.522
our health. our
family. and our faith.

741
00:37:32.557 --> 00:37:33.952
[phone vibrating]

742
00:37:37.155 --> 00:37:39.188
Police Chief Sanders?

743
00:37:39.223 --> 00:37:42.125
Did I interrupt you
refilling the pepper grinder?

744
00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.765
No. no. pepper refills are
performed at 10:00 and 6:00

745
00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:45.634
daily.

746
00:37:45.669 --> 00:37:46.965
I'm good for the night.

747
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.134
[chuckles] Hey. listen.

748
00:37:51.169 --> 00:37:55.941
I was thinking. would
you want to maybe get

749
00:37:55.976 --> 00:37:58.515
some ice cream or something?

750
00:37:58.550 --> 00:38:00.011
I could come by if
it's not too late.

751
00:38:03.313 --> 00:38:05.456
Is that a yes. then?

752
00:38:05.491 --> 00:38:06.457
I'll pick you up?

753
00:38:06.492 --> 00:38:07.491
Sure.

754
00:38:07.526 --> 00:38:08.217
See you in a bit.

755
00:38:20.363 --> 00:38:21.901
Is yours as good as it looks?

756
00:38:21.936 --> 00:38:24.541
I'm not sharing.

757
00:38:24.576 --> 00:38:26.136
Hey. you know a decent mechanic?

758
00:38:26.171 --> 00:38:29.040
Because my dash is like
all warning lights.

759
00:38:29.075 --> 00:38:31.306
Uh. I do. actually.

760
00:38:31.341 --> 00:38:32.582
Who won't cheat me?

761
00:38:32.617 --> 00:38:33.979
Oh. no. he'll
definitely cheat you.

762
00:38:34.014 --> 00:38:35.849
But his work is solid.

763
00:38:40.889 --> 00:38:42.823
You know. I know we don't really
know each other that well.

764
00:38:42.858 --> 00:38:44.429
but I feel like something
might be bothering you.

765
00:38:44.464 --> 00:38:45.529
Am I wrong?

766
00:38:48.798 --> 00:38:52.998
When you were at my house. you
obviously knew Maggie was gone.

767
00:38:53.033 --> 00:38:55.539
We had a whole
conversation that--

768
00:38:55.574 --> 00:38:59.235
I don't know-- I just think
it's a little strange.

769
00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:00.709
And you're annoyed?

770
00:39:00.744 --> 00:39:03.338
Absolutely not annoyed.

771
00:39:03.373 --> 00:39:05.615
Mildly put out.

772
00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:07.243
That's fair.

773
00:39:07.278 --> 00:39:09.916
That I didn't tell you
about Maggie's murder

774
00:39:09.951 --> 00:39:11.918
before I told her husband.

775
00:39:11.953 --> 00:39:13.689
It was just
strange. like I said.

776
00:39:13.724 --> 00:39:16.626
to see the news that night and
think back on our conversation

777
00:39:16.661 --> 00:39:18.595
and how you didn't say a word.

778
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:21.895
I am obligated to
inform the next of kin

779
00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:23.193
before the next door neighbor.

780
00:39:23.228 --> 00:39:24.194
Whatever.

781
00:39:24.229 --> 00:39:24.898
I'm always the last to know.

782
00:39:37.979 --> 00:39:38.780
You have a lot that's--

783
00:39:38.815 --> 00:39:40.243
[laughs]

784
00:39:40.278 --> 00:39:41.211
Yeah. there you go.

785
00:39:41.246 --> 00:39:41.816
Thank you.

786
00:39:45.756 --> 00:39:46.689
Want to go for a walk?

787
00:39:51.256 --> 00:39:53.465
Then I see him come out of the
bathroom with this other guy.

788
00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:56.259
And Jim looks like he's been
shoved around a little bit.

789
00:39:56.294 --> 00:39:57.799
And then the other
guy just roars

790
00:39:57.834 --> 00:39:59.163
off in this delivery truck.

791
00:39:59.198 --> 00:40:00.131
I don't know.

792
00:40:00.166 --> 00:40:01.429
I just thought it was odd.

793
00:40:01.464 --> 00:40:02.430
Hey. do you like to gamble?

794
00:40:02.465 --> 00:40:03.937
Because I work at the casino.

795
00:40:03.972 --> 00:40:05.070
And I don't know-- if you
ever wanted to come up--

796
00:40:05.105 --> 00:40:06.610
Hold on. go back.

797
00:40:06.645 --> 00:40:10.174
So Jay misses the beginning
of his wife's funeral

798
00:40:10.209 --> 00:40:12.440
because he's been shoved
around by some guy

799
00:40:12.475 --> 00:40:14.585
that drives the delivery truck?

800
00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.015
It was odd. right?

801
00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:19.524
See. I'm usually so not
even close on this stuff.

802
00:40:19.559 --> 00:40:24.452
Did you happen to see the
name on the side of the truck?

803
00:40:24.487 --> 00:40:26.927
Maybe there's
security footage?

804
00:40:26.962 --> 00:40:27.963
I watch a lot of SVU.

805
00:40:31.032 --> 00:40:31.800
Liberty.

806
00:40:31.835 --> 00:40:33.263
Liberty Bell Foods.

807
00:40:33.298 --> 00:40:36.673
I remember the bell.

808
00:40:36.708 --> 00:40:38.136
Junior detective.

809
00:40:41.174 --> 00:40:43.438
Hey. look who's
a sex offender.

810
00:40:43.473 --> 00:40:44.373
I didn't do nothing.

811
00:40:44.408 --> 00:40:45.110
Why am I here?

812
00:40:45.145 --> 00:40:45.979
Child porn?

813
00:40:46.014 --> 00:40:47.145
That's nothing to you?

814
00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:48.982
You can't arrest
me on that again.

815
00:40:49.017 --> 00:40:52.183
That's eminent domain.

816
00:40:52.218 --> 00:40:55.318
Well. you got us there.
Tommy T. What do you

817
00:40:55.353 --> 00:40:58.156
and Jay Moore have going
on at the sandwich shop?

818
00:40:58.191 --> 00:40:58.959
Nothing's going.

819
00:40:58.994 --> 00:40:59.960
What?

820
00:40:59.995 --> 00:41:01.632
With Liberty Bell Foods?

821
00:41:01.667 --> 00:41:03.634
Jay buys from you.
instead of corporate.

822
00:41:03.669 --> 00:41:04.569
Pro tip.

823
00:41:04.604 --> 00:41:06.461
We already know.

824
00:41:06.496 --> 00:41:07.836
Hey. you don't know shit.

825
00:41:07.871 --> 00:41:09.134
Why don't you go back to France?

826
00:41:09.169 --> 00:41:11.169
Leave us hard-working
Americans alone.

827
00:41:11.204 --> 00:41:14.843
Keep in mind you're in
a massive shitstorm here.

828
00:41:14.878 --> 00:41:17.648
[sighs] And it's all expired.

829
00:41:17.683 --> 00:41:20.508
They're just going to throw
that shit out anyways.

830
00:41:20.543 --> 00:41:21.883
The chips?

831
00:41:21.918 --> 00:41:25.480
Yeah. the chips. the
meat. cheese. all of it.

832
00:41:25.515 --> 00:41:31.486
So Jay buys expired food from
you and sells it at his place?

833
00:41:31.521 --> 00:41:32.861
That is so disgusting.

834
00:41:32.896 --> 00:41:34.929
And what do you
get out of this?

835
00:41:34.964 --> 00:41:38.163
Nothing. a couple of bucks.

836
00:41:38.198 --> 00:41:40.770
Well. see. we heard that
Jay and his wife Maggie

837
00:41:40.805 --> 00:41:42.871
got in a big fight right
before she was murdered.

838
00:41:42.906 --> 00:41:45.269
and the word "filth" came up.

839
00:41:45.304 --> 00:41:48.910
So I'm wondering. maybe in
exchange for this cheap.

840
00:41:48.945 --> 00:41:53.112
expired food. Jay provided
you with some form

841
00:41:53.147 --> 00:41:55.510
of sexual gratification
that you're not allowed

842
00:41:55.545 --> 00:41:56.852
to have in your possession?

843
00:41:56.887 --> 00:41:58.414
You sick fuck.

844
00:41:58.449 --> 00:41:59.217
Uh-uh.

845
00:41:59.252 --> 00:42:00.053
That's crazy.

846
00:42:00.088 --> 00:42:01.417
False.

847
00:42:01.452 --> 00:42:03.122
That's why she kicks
him out of the house.

848
00:42:03.157 --> 00:42:05.388
That's why she
initiates the divorce.

849
00:42:05.423 --> 00:42:06.961
You kill Maggie
Moore. Tommy T?

850
00:42:06.996 --> 00:42:07.698
Me?

851
00:42:07.733 --> 00:42:09.557
No fucking way!

852
00:42:09.592 --> 00:42:11.295
Maybe you know somebody
in that line of work.

853
00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:12.428
No. no. man.

854
00:42:12.463 --> 00:42:14.529
I swear on my mom's life.

855
00:42:14.564 --> 00:42:16.201
See. I know I
should believe you

856
00:42:16.236 --> 00:42:17.708
because you're such
an upstanding citizen.

857
00:42:17.743 --> 00:42:18.874
but I don't know.

858
00:42:18.909 --> 00:42:20.744
I'm starting to
warm to my theory.

859
00:42:20.779 --> 00:42:23.780
[ominous music]

860
00:42:49.269 --> 00:42:53.678
Please. take my bag.

861
00:42:53.713 --> 00:42:54.305
Take my jewelry.

862
00:42:58.311 --> 00:43:00.751
There's credit cards in there.

863
00:43:00.786 --> 00:43:02.049
I can give you the pins.

864
00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:08.616
Would you mind if I
kept my insulin kit?

865
00:43:08.651 --> 00:43:09.991
I have diabetes.

866
00:43:10.026 --> 00:43:10.860
It's not worth anything.

867
00:43:13.733 --> 00:43:16.426
Here. here.

868
00:43:16.461 --> 00:43:19.396
[dramatic music]

869
00:43:44.654 --> 00:43:46.324
[screaming] Help me!

870
00:43:46.359 --> 00:43:49.360
[crying]

871
00:44:05.917 --> 00:44:09.754
You got the other
Maggie. too. right?

872
00:44:09.789 --> 00:44:12.086
Did you make her think
you'd let her go. too?

873
00:44:17.357 --> 00:44:19.654
Fuck you. you twisted
piece of shit!

874
00:44:19.689 --> 00:44:20.292
Oh!

875
00:44:46.958 --> 00:44:48.452
[gunshot]

876
00:44:59.399 --> 00:45:00.068
Wow.

877
00:45:00.103 --> 00:45:02.070
You know what?

878
00:45:02.105 --> 00:45:06.041
They just-- there's this new
invention they came up with.

879
00:45:06.076 --> 00:45:07.570
It's called a car wash.

880
00:45:07.605 --> 00:45:09.814
And what they do is they
take all of the dirt off

881
00:45:09.849 --> 00:45:10.980
of the outside of
the car. and then

882
00:45:11.015 --> 00:45:12.113
you can see what color it is.

883
00:45:12.148 --> 00:45:13.147
Huh.

884
00:45:13.182 --> 00:45:15.281
I can't see that catching on.

885
00:45:15.316 --> 00:45:16.447
Really?

886
00:45:16.482 --> 00:45:18.053
You're not an
investor. I hope.

887
00:45:18.088 --> 00:45:20.088
So I changed the oil. and
the tire pressure was low.

888
00:45:20.123 --> 00:45:23.795
And the gas sensor was
the passenger side airbag.

889
00:45:23.830 --> 00:45:25.896
You need a new one.

890
00:45:25.931 --> 00:45:27.095
How much?

891
00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:29.724
3.200 plus tax.

892
00:45:29.759 --> 00:45:31.902
For a passenger airbag?

893
00:45:31.937 --> 00:45:34.399
I can't think of anyone
that I like that much.

894
00:45:34.434 --> 00:45:36.500
Yeah. that's a pass.

895
00:45:36.535 --> 00:45:37.072
All right.

896
00:45:37.107 --> 00:45:37.842
Sorry.

897
00:45:37.877 --> 00:45:38.909
Give me a minute.

898
00:45:38.944 --> 00:45:39.503
Thanks. Bud.

899
00:45:39.538 --> 00:45:41.076
Boss.

900
00:45:41.111 --> 00:45:41.846
3.200?

901
00:45:41.881 --> 00:45:43.144
That's nuts.

902
00:45:43.179 --> 00:45:44.772
Well. to be fair.
I did say Buddy would

903
00:45:44.807 --> 00:45:47.951
most likely try to cheat you.

904
00:45:47.986 --> 00:45:51.020
Oh. uh. I got to go.

905
00:45:51.055 --> 00:45:52.252
Are you going to be OK here?

906
00:45:52.287 --> 00:45:53.022
Yeah.

907
00:45:53.057 --> 00:45:54.518
You heard the man.

908
00:45:54.553 --> 00:45:55.992
Half of my air bags are
in perfect working order.

909
00:45:56.027 --> 00:45:57.752
Go be a policeman.

910
00:45:57.787 --> 00:46:00.590
Police chief.
thank you very much.

911
00:46:00.625 --> 00:46:01.965
Fancy badge.

912
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:02.658
I'll call you later.

913
00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:07.938
Wash your car.

914
00:46:07.973 --> 00:46:09.269
Wash your ass.

915
00:46:09.304 --> 00:46:11.469
I heard that.

916
00:46:11.504 --> 00:46:13.438
[siren]

917
00:46:13.473 --> 00:46:16.276
The vehicle's registered to
Maggie Moore. lives a few miles

918
00:46:16.311 --> 00:46:17.145
from here.

919
00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:18.311
You say Maggie Moore?

920
00:46:18.346 --> 00:46:20.016
Weird. right?

921
00:46:20.051 --> 00:46:22.480
Two dead Maggie
Moores one week apart.

922
00:46:22.515 --> 00:46:23.613
Yeah. that's weird.

923
00:46:23.648 --> 00:46:24.251
Hey. chief.

924
00:46:31.326 --> 00:46:34.129
First Maggie's a mistake. so
he chops off this ring finger

925
00:46:34.164 --> 00:46:36.560
to prove he got it right?

926
00:46:36.595 --> 00:46:37.869
Prove to who?

927
00:46:37.904 --> 00:46:39.464
I'm thinking the husband.

928
00:46:39.499 --> 00:46:41.499
I mean. who else
would know the ring?

929
00:46:41.534 --> 00:46:42.665
That's assuming
she was married

930
00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:44.876
and assuming she wore a ring.

931
00:46:44.911 --> 00:46:47.703
We don't know any of that.

932
00:46:47.738 --> 00:46:50.244
Imagine that conversation.
the husband telling the guy he

933
00:46:50.279 --> 00:46:51.410
killed the wrong Maggie Moore.

934
00:46:51.445 --> 00:46:52.147
You're sure?

935
00:46:52.182 --> 00:46:53.214
Yeah. I'm sure.

936
00:46:53.249 --> 00:46:54.743
She's right here
making meatloaf.

937
00:46:54.778 --> 00:46:56.811
It would mean Tommy T
and Jay are off the hook.

938
00:46:56.846 --> 00:46:59.418
Yeah. and the end of the whole
Liberty Bell Foods conspiracy.

939
00:46:59.453 --> 00:47:01.057
I know how much you wanted
to make that happen.

940
00:47:06.262 --> 00:47:08.933
Did your wife
wear a wedding ring?

941
00:47:08.968 --> 00:47:10.759
Yes. matching.

942
00:47:10.794 --> 00:47:12.200
Can I get a picture. please?

943
00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:18.008
Got it.

944
00:47:18.043 --> 00:47:21.374
What can you
tell us. Mr. Moore?

945
00:47:21.409 --> 00:47:23.112
Anything going on in her life?

946
00:47:23.147 --> 00:47:25.015
Duane Rich.

947
00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:29.118
If you want to know who
did this. Duane Rich.

948
00:47:29.153 --> 00:47:30.845
OK?

949
00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:34.288
He worked with Maggie. just
gave her nothing but trouble.

950
00:47:34.323 --> 00:47:36.092
Made her life goddamn miserable.

951
00:47:36.127 --> 00:47:37.225
Was this at the credit union?

952
00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:38.589
Yeah.

953
00:47:38.624 --> 00:47:39.458
What kind of trouble
are we talking about?

954
00:47:39.493 --> 00:47:41.196
Hate crime stuff.

955
00:47:41.231 --> 00:47:44.397
He would leave like notes
with swastikas on her desk.

956
00:47:44.432 --> 00:47:46.102
She would come back from
lunch. and there would be

957
00:47:46.137 --> 00:47:48.203
like a web page open to ovens.

958
00:47:48.238 --> 00:47:49.435
KB: Because you're Jewish.

959
00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:50.634
Well. no shit
because she's Jewish.

960
00:47:53.837 --> 00:47:55.606
She went to HR.

961
00:47:55.641 --> 00:47:58.081
They finally fired his ass.

962
00:47:58.116 --> 00:48:01.051
Was there any concern on
her part with this Duane Rich

963
00:48:01.086 --> 00:48:04.384
that her life might
actually be in danger?

964
00:48:04.419 --> 00:48:07.123
She asked me for a gun.

965
00:48:07.158 --> 00:48:08.784
That's how scared she was.

966
00:48:08.819 --> 00:48:11.721
But I talked her out of it.

967
00:48:11.756 --> 00:48:13.459
I told her that she
was overreacting.

968
00:48:13.494 --> 00:48:15.164
The guy was just a bully.

969
00:48:18.004 --> 00:48:20.895
I was supposed to protect her.

970
00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:21.764
Look what I did.

971
00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:28.309
Seemed legit.

972
00:48:28.344 --> 00:48:30.014
Well. just because he
feels bad doesn't mean

973
00:48:30.049 --> 00:48:30.806
he didn't do it.

974
00:48:38.453 --> 00:48:40.321
Ma'am. please. I
got nothing to say.

975
00:48:40.356 --> 00:48:42.026
Another woman was
murdered with the same name

976
00:48:42.061 --> 00:48:42.950
as your wife.

977
00:48:42.985 --> 00:48:43.621
You must have an opinion.

978
00:48:43.656 --> 00:48:44.919
My opinion?

979
00:48:44.954 --> 00:48:46.327
My opinion is that
I am grief stricken.

980
00:48:46.362 --> 00:48:48.857
And you should be
ashamed of yourself.

981
00:48:48.892 --> 00:48:50.793
Jesus Christ.

982
00:48:50.828 --> 00:48:52.927
Sorry about the
ruckus here. sir.

983
00:48:52.962 --> 00:48:53.763
I got this. Greg.

984
00:48:53.798 --> 00:48:56.667
Take out the trash.

985
00:48:56.702 --> 00:48:58.042
What are we having today. sir?

986
00:48:58.077 --> 00:49:03.542
Uh. turkey provolone
foot long on wheat.

987
00:49:03.577 --> 00:49:05.808
All right.

988
00:49:05.843 --> 00:49:06.677
Turkey provolone.

989
00:49:06.712 --> 00:49:07.876
How's your day going?

990
00:49:07.911 --> 00:49:08.547
Excellent.

991
00:49:08.582 --> 00:49:09.449
Yeah?

992
00:49:09.484 --> 00:49:11.451
You win the mega ball?

993
00:49:11.486 --> 00:49:12.221
Yeah. I'm just kidding.

994
00:49:36.874 --> 00:49:39.347
[clearing throat]

995
00:49:39.382 --> 00:49:40.876
Something wrong. sir?

996
00:49:45.685 --> 00:49:46.486
Seriously?

997
00:49:46.521 --> 00:49:47.322
You went undercover?

998
00:49:47.357 --> 00:49:48.224
This isn't our meat.

999
00:49:48.259 --> 00:49:49.159
This isn't our cheese.

1000
00:49:49.194 --> 00:49:50.259
This isn't our produce.

1001
00:49:50.294 --> 00:49:51.755
These aren't even
our snack chips.

1002
00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:55.924
What you do have
is a lot of mold.

1003
00:49:55.959 --> 00:49:59.862
Yeah. that's avocado.
I'm pretty sure.

1004
00:49:59.897 --> 00:50:03.371
You're in breach of your
franchise agreement. Mr. Moore.

1005
00:50:03.406 --> 00:50:06.704
Look. man. I
just lost my wife.

1006
00:50:06.739 --> 00:50:09.872
The poor woman was murdered.

1007
00:50:09.907 --> 00:50:11.280
I'm sorry for your loss.

1008
00:50:11.315 --> 00:50:12.743
I am.

1009
00:50:12.778 --> 00:50:14.085
But this is a serious violation.

1010
00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:14.712
I know.

1011
00:50:14.747 --> 00:50:16.087
I know.

1012
00:50:16.122 --> 00:50:17.847
But can you just. like.
do me a solid human

1013
00:50:17.882 --> 00:50:21.389
being a human being?

1014
00:50:21.424 --> 00:50:22.588
I didn't even get
to say goodbye.

1015
00:50:22.623 --> 00:50:23.754
She was burned up so bad.

1016
00:50:27.331 --> 00:50:29.925
$600.

1017
00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:31.729
Sorry?

1018
00:50:31.764 --> 00:50:32.862
You're asking me to help you.

1019
00:50:32.897 --> 00:50:34.600
I'm helping you.

1020
00:50:34.635 --> 00:50:36.866
For $600?

1021
00:50:36.901 --> 00:50:41.442
What price would you put on
keeping your shop open. huh?

1022
00:50:41.477 --> 00:50:43.609
Get the fuck out.

1023
00:50:43.644 --> 00:50:45.941
That's my fucking price?

1024
00:50:45.976 --> 00:50:48.449
Get out of my shop. man.

1025
00:50:48.484 --> 00:50:49.714
Go!

1026
00:50:49.749 --> 00:50:51.320
Are you fucking
serious with this. man?

1027
00:50:51.355 --> 00:50:52.882
OK.

1028
00:50:52.917 --> 00:50:54.422
I'm a goddamn widower!

1029
00:51:03.631 --> 00:51:04.201
Shit.

1030
00:51:14.675 --> 00:51:15.278
Hey. hey.

1031
00:51:18.217 --> 00:51:20.283
I'm sorry.

1032
00:51:20.318 --> 00:51:21.647
It's been a rough
couple of weeks.

1033
00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:25.189
600.

1034
00:51:37.632 --> 00:51:38.202
Duane Rich?

1035
00:51:43.209 --> 00:51:45.132
I don't know
what you've heard.

1036
00:51:45.167 --> 00:51:48.311
Well. I'll tell you what
we've heard. Mr. Rich.

1037
00:51:48.346 --> 00:51:50.940
Maggie's husband said that
you continuously harassed

1038
00:51:50.975 --> 00:51:54.350
her and were anti-Semitic.

1039
00:51:54.385 --> 00:51:56.946
And HR said that you
were fired from your job

1040
00:51:56.981 --> 00:51:59.718
for those very reasons.

1041
00:51:59.753 --> 00:52:02.688
Well. here's the thing is.
I don't dispute any of that.

1042
00:52:05.528 --> 00:52:07.121
The way I behaved.
it was shameful.

1043
00:52:07.156 --> 00:52:10.795
And I am mortified by it.

1044
00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:13.501
Then why did you do it?

1045
00:52:13.536 --> 00:52:19.309
Well. because I was a drunk.

1046
00:52:19.344 --> 00:52:21.311
I'm an alcoholic.

1047
00:52:21.346 --> 00:52:24.908
And getting let go.
that saved my life.

1048
00:52:24.943 --> 00:52:27.141
I went to a meeting
that night and--

1049
00:52:27.176 --> 00:52:28.747
What night?

1050
00:52:28.782 --> 00:52:32.256
The night I got fired. and
I've been going ever since.

1051
00:52:32.291 --> 00:52:35.853
So writing "death to
kikes" on her desk calendar.

1052
00:52:35.888 --> 00:52:39.087
you attribute that to the booze?

1053
00:52:39.122 --> 00:52:39.758
I liked Maggie.

1054
00:52:42.631 --> 00:52:44.730
And I hit on Maggie. and
when she rejected me.

1055
00:52:44.765 --> 00:52:47.095
I acted like a whiny
little high schooler.

1056
00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:48.734
I don't hate Jews.

1057
00:52:48.769 --> 00:52:51.165
I don't hate anybody.

1058
00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:52.199
I was just a jackass.

1059
00:52:52.234 --> 00:52:54.542
[doorbell]

1060
00:52:54.577 --> 00:52:55.136
Excuse me.

1061
00:53:02.618 --> 00:53:04.288
Hey.

1062
00:53:04.323 --> 00:53:05.850
Just get started.

1063
00:53:05.885 --> 00:53:06.455
I'll be down.

1064
00:53:09.251 --> 00:53:11.427
We hold meetings here.

1065
00:53:11.462 --> 00:53:14.221
Well. Mr. Rich. thank
you for your time.

1066
00:53:14.256 --> 00:53:17.125
We'll let you know if
we find anything else.

1067
00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:19.798
Put it back.

1068
00:53:19.833 --> 00:53:22.834
[music playing]

1069
00:54:00.676 --> 00:54:01.642
Ah.

1070
00:54:01.677 --> 00:54:02.643
No.

1071
00:54:02.678 --> 00:54:03.677
I think mine's defective.

1072
00:54:03.712 --> 00:54:04.348
I don't get it.

1073
00:54:04.383 --> 00:54:05.140
How about yours?

1074
00:54:05.175 --> 00:54:06.009
Oh. always broken.

1075
00:54:06.044 --> 00:54:07.615
No. I never win.

1076
00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:09.419
I might as well just toss
my quarters in the street.

1077
00:54:09.454 --> 00:54:10.684
Well. I wouldn't
take it personally.

1078
00:54:10.719 --> 00:54:13.115
I do think losing is
kind of the point.

1079
00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:14.083
No. I know.

1080
00:54:14.118 --> 00:54:14.683
That's why I fit right in.

1081
00:54:17.363 --> 00:54:18.252
Where else should we lose?

1082
00:54:18.287 --> 00:54:20.991
Oh. so many choices.

1083
00:54:21.026 --> 00:54:22.828
Hey. Rita. something to drink?

1084
00:54:22.863 --> 00:54:25.292
Ooh. I will have
your finest white wine

1085
00:54:25.327 --> 00:54:26.601
spritzer please. Jody.

1086
00:54:26.636 --> 00:54:27.602
And a Budweiser.

1087
00:54:27.637 --> 00:54:28.229
Thank you.

1088
00:54:31.476 --> 00:54:33.300
That's impressive.

1089
00:54:33.335 --> 00:54:35.038
Full eye contact
despite the boobage.

1090
00:54:35.073 --> 00:54:36.644
Good job.

1091
00:54:36.679 --> 00:54:38.041
What?

1092
00:54:38.076 --> 00:54:40.274
Pretty girl with a nice
body is just genetics.

1093
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:41.979
If she could play the piano.
then I'd be impressed.

1094
00:54:42.014 --> 00:54:44.982
[laughs] Oh. OK.

1095
00:54:45.017 --> 00:54:47.853
Well. this is a game
of skill and strategy.

1096
00:54:47.888 --> 00:54:49.987
Yes. I know roulette
is for suckers.

1097
00:54:50.022 --> 00:54:52.693
but I have a foolproof system.

1098
00:54:52.728 --> 00:54:54.288
Watch.

1099
00:54:54.323 --> 00:54:56.565
DEALER: No more bets.

1100
00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:57.566
I'm going to get us a room.

1101
00:55:05.037 --> 00:55:06.575
DEALER: 24 black.

1102
00:55:06.610 --> 00:55:08.445
Hey. look over there. huh?

1103
00:55:11.681 --> 00:55:12.812
This is it.

1104
00:55:12.847 --> 00:55:16.750
You ready for the sex?

1105
00:55:16.785 --> 00:55:17.355
I'm ready.

1106
00:55:29.226 --> 00:55:31.259
OK. that didn't go well.

1107
00:55:31.294 --> 00:55:33.261
Yeah. I feel it's my fault.

1108
00:55:33.296 --> 00:55:34.361
No. it's not.

1109
00:55:34.396 --> 00:55:35.032
You're not into me.

1110
00:55:35.067 --> 00:55:35.901
It's fine.

1111
00:55:35.936 --> 00:55:36.836
That is not the case.

1112
00:55:36.871 --> 00:55:39.267
That is not the case.

1113
00:55:39.302 --> 00:55:42.776
I'm just feeling a little
guilty. I think. is all.

1114
00:55:42.811 --> 00:55:43.843
Guilty about what?

1115
00:55:43.878 --> 00:55:48.111
The sex. the having the sex.

1116
00:55:48.146 --> 00:55:51.521
Oh. no. really?

1117
00:55:51.556 --> 00:55:53.457
There's been no one?

1118
00:55:53.492 --> 00:55:54.887
No.

1119
00:55:54.922 --> 00:55:57.725
No. and I don't
know what to say.

1120
00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:00.926
I just feel like
I'm still attached

1121
00:56:00.961 --> 00:56:05.128
to her somehow in my heart.

1122
00:56:05.163 --> 00:56:08.098
Yeah. I know.

1123
00:56:08.133 --> 00:56:10.771
Believe me. I know how
cheesy that sounds.

1124
00:56:10.806 --> 00:56:11.904
That doesn't make it not true.

1125
00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:19.912
You know what else is true?

1126
00:56:19.947 --> 00:56:23.080
Every day when I wake
up. I think about you.

1127
00:56:23.115 --> 00:56:26.820
And every time I see you.
my heart beats so loud.

1128
00:56:26.855 --> 00:56:29.119
I can't believe
you can't hear it.

1129
00:56:29.154 --> 00:56:30.560
You don't have
to say that stuff.

1130
00:56:30.595 --> 00:56:33.222
I know I'm no bargain.

1131
00:56:33.257 --> 00:56:34.960
What?

1132
00:56:34.995 --> 00:56:36.225
Why do you do that?

1133
00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:38.799
Why do you put yourself
down like that?

1134
00:56:38.834 --> 00:56:40.504
I don't.

1135
00:56:40.539 --> 00:56:42.132
You do.

1136
00:56:42.167 --> 00:56:45.135
You say things like.
my ex broke me.

1137
00:56:45.170 --> 00:56:47.907
and I never can catch a break.
and I know I'm no bargain.

1138
00:56:47.942 --> 00:56:49.139
Like. what is that?

1139
00:56:49.174 --> 00:56:51.845
Why?

1140
00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:53.341
Maybe we're both mental cases.

1141
00:56:56.819 --> 00:56:58.379
I'm pretty sure they have robes.

1142
00:57:04.992 --> 00:57:06.420
Ms. Novak. what
new information

1143
00:57:06.455 --> 00:57:09.698
do you have on the murder
of Maggie Lee Moore?

1144
00:57:09.733 --> 00:57:11.799
Andy would come into my
bar all the time. you know?

1145
00:57:11.834 --> 00:57:15.264
Buy me a shot. flirt with me.

1146
00:57:15.299 --> 00:57:17.871
Not really my type.
but I don't know.

1147
00:57:17.906 --> 00:57:20.335
We kind of hit it off
after a little while.

1148
00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:22.810
I didn't know he was
married. you know.

1149
00:57:22.845 --> 00:57:28.013
What was it like the first
time after your divorce?

1150
00:57:28.048 --> 00:57:31.049
It was pretty nerve
racking. actually.

1151
00:57:31.084 --> 00:57:36.626
Different body. different
feel. different smell.

1152
00:57:36.661 --> 00:57:38.155
I mean. all the
pieces were the same.

1153
00:57:38.190 --> 00:57:43.028
but it was just so peculiar.

1154
00:57:43.063 --> 00:57:44.491
But you got through it.

1155
00:57:44.526 --> 00:57:46.031
I did get through it.

1156
00:57:46.066 --> 00:57:48.803
Yeah. I persevered.
and I did my damnedest.

1157
00:57:48.838 --> 00:57:52.070
And then when it was over.
I hydrated and stretched

1158
00:57:52.105 --> 00:57:54.237
a little bit and
got back in there.

1159
00:57:54.272 --> 00:57:55.238
Atta. girl.

1160
00:57:55.273 --> 00:57:56.679
You are a true American hero.

1161
00:57:56.714 --> 00:58:02.047
[chuckles] You're right
about the victim stuff.

1162
00:58:02.082 --> 00:58:04.247
I could go through
the whole list--

1163
00:58:04.282 --> 00:58:10.220
parents. boyfriends.
bosses. my ex. my realtor.

1164
00:58:10.255 --> 00:58:11.661
Everybody gets their way.

1165
00:58:11.696 --> 00:58:13.663
Don't mind me.

1166
00:58:13.698 --> 00:58:16.490
I'm pathetic.

1167
00:58:16.525 --> 00:58:17.524
And I just did it again.

1168
00:58:17.559 --> 00:58:19.328
Yeah. stop doing that.

1169
00:58:19.363 --> 00:58:21.396
Stop letting it happen.

1170
00:58:21.431 --> 00:58:24.938
Stop letting yourself
get steamrolled.

1171
00:58:24.973 --> 00:58:26.940
Otherwise. what's
even the point?

1172
00:58:32.717 --> 00:58:33.276
What the hell?

1173
00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:38.853
REPORTER (ON TV):
To be clear. are

1174
00:58:38.888 --> 00:58:43.220
you claiming Andy Moore told you
he planned to murder his wife?

1175
00:58:43.255 --> 00:58:46.091
About a month ago. he said
he wanted her gone so that we

1176
00:58:46.126 --> 00:58:48.962
could be together. which I
thought was just a dumb line

1177
00:58:48.997 --> 00:58:52.097
until. you know. she was gone.

1178
00:58:52.132 --> 00:58:53.527
Did you hear that?

1179
00:58:53.562 --> 00:58:55.397
She just dropped a dime
on Maggie Lee's husband.

1180
00:58:55.432 --> 00:58:56.772
Yeah.

1181
00:58:56.807 --> 00:58:58.807
I have to say. Andy
was a gentleman with me.

1182
00:58:58.842 --> 00:59:02.140
But his eyes were always
a little weird. you know?

1183
00:59:02.175 --> 00:59:05.539
He always scared
me just a little.

1184
00:59:05.574 --> 00:59:08.245
And how long were you having
an affair with Mr. Moore?

1185
00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:09.818
About four months.

1186
00:59:09.853 --> 00:59:12.887
Off the record. tiny dick.

1187
00:59:12.922 --> 00:59:14.152
But he loved the gem.

1188
00:59:14.187 --> 00:59:16.550
He'd stay down there for hours.

1189
00:59:16.585 --> 00:59:18.585
You do know you're talking
to the police right now. right?

1190
00:59:18.620 --> 00:59:20.257
She's just giving
us a little color.

1191
00:59:20.292 --> 00:59:22.556
She's just filling
in the details.

1192
00:59:22.591 --> 00:59:25.130
Did Mr. Moore
ever mention to you

1193
00:59:25.165 --> 00:59:26.835
how he planned on
dealing with Mrs. Moore

1194
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:28.562
and getting her
out of the picture?

1195
00:59:28.597 --> 00:59:32.467
Oh. you mean like the lead
pipe or a rope or a revolver?

1196
00:59:32.502 --> 00:59:33.974
Uh. no.

1197
00:59:34.009 --> 00:59:35.646
No.

1198
00:59:35.681 --> 00:59:37.604
Maybe did he ever say maybe
he was going to call somebody

1199
00:59:37.639 --> 00:59:39.441
or that he knew a guy?

1200
00:59:39.476 --> 00:59:42.752
Oh. yeah. Duane.

1201
00:59:42.787 --> 00:59:45.821
I don't know his last name.
but I remember he said Duane

1202
00:59:45.856 --> 00:59:47.790
would do it in a heartbeat.

1203
00:59:47.825 --> 00:59:50.188
Do you have some way of
proving your relationship

1204
00:59:50.223 --> 00:59:51.761
with Mr. Moore?

1205
00:59:51.796 --> 00:59:54.698
He was very. very
careful about being seen.

1206
00:59:54.733 --> 00:59:58.163
And he always paid. so I don't
have. like. any receipts.

1207
00:59:58.198 --> 00:59:59.967
Maybe you could give
us a list of places

1208
01:00:00.002 --> 01:00:01.463
you went so we can verify it.

1209
01:00:01.498 --> 01:00:03.135
Oh. yeah. I can just do that.

1210
01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:06.875
I kept a journal in case there's
ever a book about my life.

1211
01:00:06.910 --> 01:00:10.538
She had insurance.
BTW. Maggie did.

1212
01:00:10.573 --> 01:00:12.177
Life insurance?

1213
01:00:12.212 --> 01:00:12.815
700k.

1214
01:00:15.677 --> 01:00:18.348
This nutcase is setting me up.

1215
01:00:18.383 --> 01:00:20.548
I mean. it's bad
enough what happened.

1216
01:00:20.583 --> 01:00:21.956
Now I got to deal with this?

1217
01:00:21.991 --> 01:00:25.058
Any idea why she would
do this. set you up?

1218
01:00:25.093 --> 01:00:26.994
Obviously. she's
an attention whore.

1219
01:00:27.029 --> 01:00:29.128
I mean. look at her. right?

1220
01:00:29.163 --> 01:00:30.525
She's loving this.

1221
01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:31.999
OK. but how did she
know your wife had

1222
01:00:32.034 --> 01:00:34.705
700k worth of life insurance?

1223
01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:36.905
Maybe she knows
someone who knew Maggie?

1224
01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:39.039
I mean. she mentioned
Duane. right?

1225
01:00:39.074 --> 01:00:41.712
Maybe they're buddies
from Nazi camp.

1226
01:00:41.747 --> 01:00:43.208
Well. right now.
there's nothing to suggest

1227
01:00:43.243 --> 01:00:44.374
he was involved with this.

1228
01:00:44.409 --> 01:00:45.980
Nothing to suggest
he was involved.

1229
01:00:46.015 --> 01:00:48.719
the guy who wanted to actually
shove her into an oven.

1230
01:00:48.754 --> 01:00:49.852
Do you say anything
at any point.

1231
01:00:49.887 --> 01:00:51.348
or are you just here to observe?

1232
01:00:51.383 --> 01:00:52.723
Answer the
officer's questions.

1233
01:00:52.758 --> 01:00:55.022
Andy. and try to keep
an even temperament.

1234
01:00:55.057 --> 01:00:56.650
This is not easy for anybody.

1235
01:00:56.685 --> 01:00:57.486
Easy for you.

1236
01:00:57.521 --> 01:00:59.059
You just sit there.

1237
01:00:59.094 --> 01:01:00.588
What about a polygraph?

1238
01:01:00.623 --> 01:01:02.326
It might help to
clear some things up.

1239
01:01:02.361 --> 01:01:03.360
I'm on Lexapro.

1240
01:01:03.395 --> 01:01:05.428
It can screw with the results.

1241
01:01:05.463 --> 01:01:09.366
If I had a lawyer. he
would back me up on that.

1242
01:01:09.401 --> 01:01:12.369
At this point. I don't see
what else Mr. Moore can offer.

1243
01:01:12.404 --> 01:01:14.778
He was here at work at the
time of his wife's death.

1244
01:01:14.813 --> 01:01:17.044
and nothing connects him
with that horrific crime.

1245
01:01:17.079 --> 01:01:20.784
except the unsubstantiated
claim of a complete stranger.

1246
01:01:20.819 --> 01:01:23.248
So unless there's
something else.

1247
01:01:23.283 --> 01:01:25.382
I see no reason to waste
any more of his time.

1248
01:01:29.124 --> 01:01:30.453
Nope.

1249
01:01:30.488 --> 01:01:32.422
I think that's all
we have for now.

1250
01:01:32.457 --> 01:01:33.896
Thank you. gentlemen.

1251
01:01:33.931 --> 01:01:34.556
Andy.

1252
01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:39.902
When he does say something.
he makes a decent point.

1253
01:01:42.808 --> 01:01:45.402
What does that
word mean to you?

1254
01:01:45.437 --> 01:01:46.469
Pleasure?

1255
01:01:46.504 --> 01:01:48.042
Contentment?

1256
01:01:48.077 --> 01:01:49.912
State of well-being?

1257
01:01:49.947 --> 01:01:52.046
Does money make you happy?

1258
01:01:52.081 --> 01:01:53.883
Does your partner?

1259
01:01:53.918 --> 01:01:54.741
Good friends?

1260
01:01:54.776 --> 01:01:56.413
A good steak?

1261
01:01:56.448 --> 01:01:58.481
What about you?

1262
01:01:58.516 --> 01:02:01.583
Figure it out because
that's your next assignment.

1263
01:02:01.618 --> 01:02:03.156
REPORTER (ON TV): The

Andy Moore outside of his home.

1266
01:02:06.425 --> 01:02:07.424
I don't know this woman.

1267
01:02:07.459 --> 01:02:08.964
I had nothing to do with this.

1268
01:02:08.999 --> 01:02:11.593
You want to talk to someone.
you talk to Duane Rich.

1269
01:02:11.628 --> 01:02:13.430
Ask him about the death threats.

1270
01:02:13.465 --> 01:02:15.465
Duane Rich.

1271
01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:16.499
Yeah!

1272
01:02:16.534 --> 01:02:18.501
Yeah. Duane Rich. motherfuckers!

1273
01:02:18.536 --> 01:02:20.569
He killed both
our fucking wives!

1274
01:02:20.604 --> 01:02:22.307
Yeah.

1275
01:02:22.342 --> 01:02:25.915

[helena. "do it to 'em"]

1280
01:02:38.325 --> 01:02:39.027
HELENA: (SINGING) Do it to 'em.

1281
01:02:39.062 --> 01:02:40.358
Do it to 'em.

1282
01:02:40.393 --> 01:02:42.096
He going to love it
when I do it to 'em.

1283
01:02:42.131 --> 01:02:42.932
Do it to 'em.

1284
01:02:42.967 --> 01:02:43.790
Do it to 'em.

1285
01:02:43.825 --> 01:02:47.200
Do it to 'em.

1286
01:02:47.235 --> 01:02:48.597
Do it to 'em.

1287
01:02:48.632 --> 01:02:50.973
Everywhere he's gotta
bust my fucking ears.

1288
01:02:51.008 --> 01:02:52.205
HELENA: (SINGING) Do it to 'em.

1289
01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:53.536
Do it to 'em.

1290
01:02:53.571 --> 01:02:54.504
He going to love it
when I do it to 'em.

1291
01:02:54.539 --> 01:02:56.176
Hey.

1292
01:02:56.211 --> 01:02:56.847
Hey.

1293
01:02:56.882 --> 01:02:59.641
Ugh!

1294
01:02:59.676 --> 01:03:00.774
HELENA: (SINGING)
Here's a secret.

1295
01:03:00.809 --> 01:03:02.512
This pussy undefeated.

1296
01:03:02.547 --> 01:03:03.854
Bend it over. touch your toes.

1297
01:03:03.889 --> 01:03:05.856
I know you want to see it.

1298
01:03:05.891 --> 01:03:08.958
Ass so thick like a
panoramic picture.

1299
01:03:08.993 --> 01:03:10.124
Show me something good.

1300
01:03:10.159 --> 01:03:11.356
What the fuck. man?

1301
01:03:16.066 --> 01:03:17.527
So the husband
pretty much fingered

1302
01:03:17.562 --> 01:03:19.034
that Duane Rich guy for us.

1303
01:03:19.069 --> 01:03:20.827
You following this?

1304
01:03:20.862 --> 01:03:21.498
Got a light?

1305
01:03:26.604 --> 01:03:27.977
You mind. darling?

1306
01:03:28.012 --> 01:03:29.572
I'm trying to conduct
some business here.

1307
01:03:29.607 --> 01:03:31.013
Then go rent a fucking office.

1308
01:03:38.957 --> 01:03:41.683
You got to make it look
like a suicide. all right?

1309
01:03:41.718 --> 01:03:43.751
He kills himself out of.
like. guilt or whatnot.

1310
01:03:43.786 --> 01:03:45.489
We're home free.

1311
01:03:45.524 --> 01:03:46.226
You feel me?

1312
01:03:49.132 --> 01:03:49.724
All good. baby.

1313
01:04:09.317 --> 01:04:10.118
How are we doing?

1314
01:04:10.153 --> 01:04:11.350
Oh. all right.

1315
01:04:11.385 --> 01:04:12.417
You?

1316
01:04:12.452 --> 01:04:13.451
OK.

1317
01:04:13.486 --> 01:04:16.454
I mean. under the circumstances.

1318
01:04:16.489 --> 01:04:18.522
Still grieving. of course.

1319
01:04:18.557 --> 01:04:20.293
Yeah. of course.

1320
01:04:20.328 --> 01:04:21.855
Yeah. I don't know if
you've been keeping up.

1321
01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:26.134
but they're closing in on
the guy. this Duane Rich.

1322
01:04:26.169 --> 01:04:26.937
That's good.

1323
01:04:26.972 --> 01:04:28.070
That's good news.

1324
01:04:28.105 --> 01:04:29.104
Yeah.

1325
01:04:29.139 --> 01:04:30.765
Yeah. it is for closure's sake.

1326
01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:31.799
You know?

1327
01:04:31.834 --> 01:04:33.735
It'd be nice to finally move on.

1328
01:04:33.770 --> 01:04:35.011
Well. it's only
been a few days.

1329
01:04:38.841 --> 01:04:42.150
I'm just saying. you don't
want to rush it emotionally.

1330
01:04:42.185 --> 01:04:43.283
Oh. yeah.

1331
01:04:43.318 --> 01:04:44.482
No. no. that's right.

1332
01:04:44.517 --> 01:04:45.153
You're right.

1333
01:04:45.188 --> 01:04:47.089
Take it slow.

1334
01:04:47.124 --> 01:04:49.454
But just things are turning
around. is my point.

1335
01:04:52.030 --> 01:04:52.820
Well. I'm glad.

1336
01:04:52.855 --> 01:04:54.162
Have a great day.

1337
01:04:54.197 --> 01:04:54.756
JAY: You. too.

1338
01:05:00.599 --> 01:05:02.500
[phone rings]

1339
01:05:05.934 --> 01:05:09.078
List of 13 different bars.
restaurants. and motels

1340
01:05:09.113 --> 01:05:11.443
that Cassie Novak says she
and Andy Moore were together

1341
01:05:11.478 --> 01:05:12.807
in just this last month.

1342
01:05:12.842 --> 01:05:16.349
March 4. 7:16 PM.
the Red Pub Inn.

1343
01:05:16.384 --> 01:05:20.023
Six Sam Adams. two
margaritas. wings with ranch.

1344
01:05:20.058 --> 01:05:22.256
She even wrote in
the extra napkins.

1345
01:05:22.291 --> 01:05:23.653
Sure did.

1346
01:05:23.688 --> 01:05:24.456
But here's the thing.

1347
01:05:24.491 --> 01:05:27.162
It all checks out.

1348
01:05:27.197 --> 01:05:28.460
It all checks out?

1349
01:05:28.495 --> 01:05:29.692
I called every
place on the list.

1350
01:05:29.727 --> 01:05:32.365
Every place has a
matching receipt.

1351
01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:38.206
Well. I think we need to
pay Andy Moore another visit.

1352
01:05:38.241 --> 01:05:39.108
Hey. Rita.

1353
01:05:39.143 --> 01:05:40.142
Can I call you back?

1354
01:05:40.177 --> 01:05:41.440
I'm just walking out the door.

1355
01:05:41.475 --> 01:05:43.178
OK. but I just ran
into Jay at the house.

1356
01:05:43.213 --> 01:05:46.115
and he said you're closing in
on Duane Rich for the murders.

1357
01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:47.347
Why would he say that?

1358
01:05:47.382 --> 01:05:49.151
I just thought you
would want to know.

1359
01:05:49.186 --> 01:05:50.548
He seemed pretty sure about it.

1360
01:05:50.583 --> 01:05:53.023
Also. we haven't really
talked since the casino.

1361
01:05:53.058 --> 01:05:54.057
Did I ruin everything?

1362
01:05:54.092 --> 01:05:55.223
No.

1363
01:05:55.258 --> 01:05:56.686
Like I said. I'm
just out the door.

1364
01:05:56.721 --> 01:05:57.522
I'll talk to you later.

1365
01:05:57.557 --> 01:05:59.161
RITA (ON PHONE): OK.

1366
01:05:59.196 --> 01:06:01.559
Trouble in paradise?

1367
01:06:01.594 --> 01:06:02.890
Maybe we're just friends. KB.

1368
01:06:02.925 --> 01:06:06.333
Not everything
has to end in sex.

1369
01:06:06.368 --> 01:06:08.896
The Dew Drop Inn.
this was the 17th.

1370
01:06:08.931 --> 01:06:10.733
Cash for the room.
cash for dinner.

1371
01:06:10.768 --> 01:06:13.472
two ribeye. two baked
potato. butter on the side--

1372
01:06:13.507 --> 01:06:14.737
OK!

1373
01:06:14.772 --> 01:06:15.969
OK. yeah. yeah.

1374
01:06:16.004 --> 01:06:17.641
OK. we had an affair.

1375
01:06:17.676 --> 01:06:19.412
--on the apple pie.

1376
01:06:19.447 --> 01:06:20.578
Why did you lie to us. Andy?

1377
01:06:20.613 --> 01:06:22.415
[sighs] Because
it had no relevance

1378
01:06:22.450 --> 01:06:24.813
to Maggie's death and could
only fuck me in the ass.

1379
01:06:24.848 --> 01:06:26.551
OK. well. look at it
from our perspective.

1380
01:06:26.586 --> 01:06:28.014
If you lied about
one thing. maybe

1381
01:06:28.049 --> 01:06:29.554
you lied about another thing.

1382
01:06:29.589 --> 01:06:32.326
Yeah. yeah. you know. I
realize it sounds insincere

1383
01:06:32.361 --> 01:06:35.494
because I did lie about Cassie.
who is a lunatic. by the way.

1384
01:06:35.529 --> 01:06:37.859
keeping track of butter.
but everything else.

1385
01:06:37.894 --> 01:06:41.269
I swear to you. is the truth.

1386
01:06:41.304 --> 01:06:43.106
So Cassie. she
made up the story

1387
01:06:43.141 --> 01:06:45.207
of you getting Duane to kill
Maggie so the two of you

1388
01:06:45.242 --> 01:06:46.505
could be together?

1389
01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:47.407
Yeah.

1390
01:06:47.442 --> 01:06:49.904
We were stoned. you know?

1391
01:06:49.939 --> 01:06:53.776
It was a bullshit
heavy metal fantasy.

1392
01:06:53.811 --> 01:06:57.219
Look. even if I wanted
out of the marriage.

1393
01:06:57.254 --> 01:07:02.752
for Maggie's life to end like
that. I'd rather it was me.

1394
01:07:06.956 --> 01:07:07.625
You believe that?

1395
01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:09.198
I'm not sure.

1396
01:07:09.233 --> 01:07:11.761
So we've got nothing
solid on two murders now.

1397
01:07:11.796 --> 01:07:13.598
How's that possible?

1398
01:07:13.633 --> 01:07:16.436
Was Maggie 1 a
mistake for Maggie 2.

1399
01:07:16.471 --> 01:07:18.273
or was Maggie 2 the
cover for Maggie 1?

1400
01:07:24.809 --> 01:07:26.215
No evidence either way.

1401
01:07:26.250 --> 01:07:29.218
Just a bunch of people
that deserve each other.

1402
01:07:29.253 --> 01:07:31.286
Somebody out there is really
good at what they're doing.

1403
01:07:39.164 --> 01:07:41.329
Good night. guys.

1404
01:07:41.364 --> 01:07:41.989
Get home safe.

1405
01:07:46.699 --> 01:07:48.138
[knocking]

1406
01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:54.243
Next time you leave
it. it's fine-- oh!

1407
01:07:54.278 --> 01:07:57.279
[muffled grunting]

1408
01:09:36.776 --> 01:09:37.247
Hey.

1409
01:09:43.651 --> 01:09:46.179
Suicide note.

1410
01:09:46.214 --> 01:09:47.917
But wait. there's more.

1411
01:09:47.952 --> 01:09:50.656
Confessions to both
Maggie Moore murders.

1412
01:09:53.463 --> 01:09:56.090
Well. that ties it all up in
a nice little bow. doesn't it?

1413
01:09:59.469 --> 01:10:01.370
Oh. I share your misery.

1414
01:10:01.405 --> 01:10:02.899
I really do.

1415
01:10:02.934 --> 01:10:05.605
Closing two cases with
the murderer's confession.

1416
01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:07.068
It's the absolute worst.

1417
01:10:07.103 --> 01:10:09.136
A confession
written on a laptop.

1418
01:10:09.171 --> 01:10:10.874
What. you want a
handwritten note?

1419
01:10:10.909 --> 01:10:12.942
Nobody writes anymore.

1420
01:10:12.977 --> 01:10:14.581
You're lucky he didn't
post it on Snapchat.

1421
01:10:17.784 --> 01:10:19.014
Because it would disappear.

1422
01:10:22.492 --> 01:10:25.053
Well. 2 o'clock's
got her eye on you.

1423
01:10:25.088 --> 01:10:27.055
2 o'clock is a
cigarette machine.

1424
01:10:27.090 --> 01:10:30.432
My 2 o'clock.

1425
01:10:30.467 --> 01:10:33.127
My 10 o'clock. sorry.

1426
01:10:33.162 --> 01:10:33.798
Yeah.

1427
01:10:38.266 --> 01:10:38.869
Hi.

1428
01:10:42.006 --> 01:10:43.313
I'm going to send
her a drink for you.

1429
01:10:43.348 --> 01:10:44.974
Just think of something
clever to say.

1430
01:10:45.009 --> 01:10:46.272
Tell you what. tell
you what. tell them

1431
01:10:46.307 --> 01:10:49.814
that I'm going to go see Rita.

1432
01:10:49.849 --> 01:10:52.113
I'm tired of being just friends.

1433
01:10:52.148 --> 01:10:54.984
And what's the point of
Duane killing Maggie 1

1434
01:10:55.019 --> 01:10:56.623
if he already knows Maggie 2?

1435
01:10:56.658 --> 01:10:58.757
If he doesn't know Maggie
2. he kills Maggie 1. fine.

1436
01:10:58.792 --> 01:10:59.692
it's a big mistake.

1437
01:10:59.727 --> 01:11:01.628
But he does know Maggie 2.

1438
01:11:01.663 --> 01:11:03.366
They work together.

1439
01:11:03.401 --> 01:11:05.093
I'm just asking.

1440
01:11:05.128 --> 01:11:07.667
To confuse the issue so we'd
have doubts he was our guy.

1441
01:11:07.702 --> 01:11:09.438
I mean. look how it's working.

1442
01:11:09.473 --> 01:11:10.439
He's a genius.

1443
01:11:10.474 --> 01:11:12.639
Yeah. well. something's off.

1444
01:11:21.650 --> 01:11:23.078
[knocking]

1445
01:11:24.147 --> 01:11:24.849
Hey.

1446
01:11:24.884 --> 01:11:25.784
Hey.

1447
01:11:25.819 --> 01:11:27.390
Not too late. is it?

1448
01:11:27.425 --> 01:11:30.558
No. just usually you call.

1449
01:11:30.593 --> 01:11:32.153
Oh. I know.

1450
01:11:32.188 --> 01:11:33.396
I'm trying to be a little
more spontaneous these days.

1451
01:11:33.431 --> 01:11:34.991
I hear the ladies
really like that.

1452
01:11:37.996 --> 01:11:39.699
Can I come in?

1453
01:11:39.734 --> 01:11:43.439
Actually. I'm-- it's
not a real good time.

1454
01:11:47.577 --> 01:11:48.202
Oh.

1455
01:11:51.174 --> 01:11:52.415
Oh. Christ.

1456
01:11:56.179 --> 01:11:57.981
Hey.

1457
01:11:58.016 --> 01:12:00.654
You know. I have
opportunities. too.

1458
01:12:00.689 --> 01:12:03.316
In fact. 10 minutes ago--

1459
01:12:03.351 --> 01:12:04.152
He's a friend.

1460
01:12:04.187 --> 01:12:05.494
I've known him forever.

1461
01:12:05.529 --> 01:12:06.495
He's your fuck buddy. right?

1462
01:12:06.530 --> 01:12:07.353
Is that what they say?

1463
01:12:07.388 --> 01:12:09.564
He's your fuck buddy?

1464
01:12:09.599 --> 01:12:10.356
I'm not judging you.

1465
01:12:10.391 --> 01:12:11.401
Let me be clear.

1466
01:12:11.436 --> 01:12:12.765
You're absolutely judging me.

1467
01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:15.405
I absolutely am because
I thought maybe you

1468
01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:16.901
and I had something
here. you know?

1469
01:12:16.936 --> 01:12:21.939
I thought you and
I had something.

1470
01:12:21.974 --> 01:12:25.008
Well. none of
that has changed.

1471
01:12:25.043 --> 01:12:27.450
Of course it's changed.

1472
01:12:27.485 --> 01:12:28.275
Of course it has.

1473
01:12:32.490 --> 01:12:34.182
He's my ex. OK?

1474
01:12:34.217 --> 01:12:37.383
It's just once in a while.

1475
01:12:37.418 --> 01:12:39.627
Your ex?

1476
01:12:39.662 --> 01:12:42.927
The guy who broke
you down pretty good?

1477
01:12:42.962 --> 01:12:45.028
I'll end it right
now if you tell me to.

1478
01:12:45.063 --> 01:12:47.569
Well. what if your ex
tells you the opposite?

1479
01:12:50.431 --> 01:12:51.298
I got to go.

1480
01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:04.080
I made a report on Maggie 2.

1481
01:13:04.115 --> 01:13:07.215
Also. Tommy T busted.

1482
01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:09.921
Dipshit tried to pick
up a minor online.

1483
01:13:09.956 --> 01:13:11.659
Anything in here
I need to know?

1484
01:13:11.694 --> 01:13:15.421
Maggie 2 was type I diabetic.
insulin in her system.

1485
01:13:15.456 --> 01:13:18.292
But otherwise. she's clean.

1486
01:13:18.327 --> 01:13:20.063
She has a fuck buddy.

1487
01:13:20.098 --> 01:13:21.471
Maggie 2?

1488
01:13:21.506 --> 01:13:22.901
Rita.

1489
01:13:22.936 --> 01:13:24.639
Rita has a fuck
buddy. her ex-husband.

1490
01:13:24.674 --> 01:13:27.268
Can you believe that?

1491
01:13:27.303 --> 01:13:31.811
Well. obviously. you
weren't satisfying her.

1492
01:13:31.846 --> 01:13:33.274
Think it's a girth issue?

1493
01:13:33.309 --> 01:13:35.518
Do you know what
your problem is?

1494
01:13:35.553 --> 01:13:40.347
You have no concept of when
it is OK to tell a joke.

1495
01:13:40.382 --> 01:13:42.987
I mean. not even
in the slightest.

1496
01:13:43.022 --> 01:13:44.857
But he's a meaningless.

1497
01:13:44.892 --> 01:13:46.628
The entire concept
behind a fuck buddy

1498
01:13:46.663 --> 01:13:47.761
is the utter lack of meaning.

1499
01:13:47.796 --> 01:13:50.258
Fuck buddy-- it's just sex.

1500
01:13:50.293 --> 01:13:51.600
Have you ever been one?

1501
01:13:51.635 --> 01:13:52.997
A fuck buddy?

1502
01:13:53.032 --> 01:13:53.668
I wish.

1503
01:13:59.368 --> 01:14:00.235
Personal effects.

1504
01:14:04.813 --> 01:14:06.142
Maggie 2 was diabetic.

1505
01:14:06.177 --> 01:14:07.880
How come she didn't
have any meds on her?

1506
01:14:07.915 --> 01:14:11.554
Contents of her purse. contents
of her car. her pockets.

1507
01:14:11.589 --> 01:14:13.556
No insulin. no testing kit.

1508
01:14:13.591 --> 01:14:16.185
Maybe she shot up
before she left the house.

1509
01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:17.219
That's not how it works.

1510
01:14:17.254 --> 01:14:18.561
I have a niece that's type 1.

1511
01:14:18.596 --> 01:14:20.530
She tests her blood
sugar all the time.

1512
01:14:20.565 --> 01:14:23.830
She carries around a
little testing kit.

1513
01:14:23.865 --> 01:14:26.162
Where's Maggie 2's testing kit?

1514
01:14:26.197 --> 01:14:28.461
Maybe Duane kept
it as a token.

1515
01:14:28.496 --> 01:14:30.067
Maybe he did.

1516
01:14:30.102 --> 01:14:31.640
But why didn't it turn up
when we searched his basement?

1517
01:14:31.675 --> 01:14:34.137
Why didn't it turn up when
we searched his house?

1518
01:14:34.172 --> 01:14:37.338
I literally have no idea
where you're going with this.

1519
01:14:37.373 --> 01:14:38.746
It's just bothersome.

1520
01:14:38.781 --> 01:14:40.308
Everything about these
two cases is bothersome.

1521
01:14:40.343 --> 01:14:42.409
Except the part where we
have Duane's confession.

1522
01:14:42.444 --> 01:14:45.148
Right. but I want to know
why he killed Maggie 1.

1523
01:14:45.183 --> 01:14:46.886
And don't tell me it
was to confuse the issue

1524
01:14:46.921 --> 01:14:49.856
because that's really flimsy.

1525
01:14:49.891 --> 01:14:50.725
And you know what?

1526
01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:52.485
Here's another thing.

1527
01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:54.828
She says if I want. she'll break
it off with the fuck buddy ex.

1528
01:14:54.863 --> 01:14:57.226
What does that even mean?

1529
01:14:57.261 --> 01:15:00.097
How much simpler
can she put it?

1530
01:15:00.132 --> 01:15:03.001
I'm not sure how I'm
supposed to get over this.

1531
01:15:03.036 --> 01:15:05.102
It's a serious infraction.

1532
01:15:05.137 --> 01:15:06.367
You know what's a
serious infraction

1533
01:15:06.402 --> 01:15:08.072
is running a red light.

1534
01:15:08.107 --> 01:15:09.502
This is human behavior.

1535
01:15:09.537 --> 01:15:12.208
You get over it because
Rita makes you happy.

1536
01:15:12.243 --> 01:15:15.277
Do I look happy?

1537
01:15:15.312 --> 01:15:15.948
I don't get it.

1538
01:15:15.983 --> 01:15:16.850
Duane's dead.

1539
01:15:16.885 --> 01:15:17.851
You have his confession.

1540
01:15:17.886 --> 01:15:19.512
Why are we still doing this?

1541
01:15:19.547 --> 01:15:22.086
We just need to follow up on
a few loose ends. Mr. Moore.

1542
01:15:22.121 --> 01:15:23.120
The ME had found--

1543
01:15:23.155 --> 01:15:24.517
Medical examiner.

1544
01:15:24.552 --> 01:15:26.387
The medical examiner
had found some insulin

1545
01:15:26.422 --> 01:15:27.256
in Maggie's blood--

1546
01:15:27.291 --> 01:15:27.894
Yeah. Mags was diabetic.

1547
01:15:27.929 --> 01:15:29.555
So what?

1548
01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:32.866
Right. but what we didn't
find was any meds on her person

1549
01:15:32.901 --> 01:15:34.065
or in her personal effects.

1550
01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:36.133
OK. that's actually
kind of strange.

1551
01:15:36.168 --> 01:15:38.036
Maggie never left the
house without her kit.

1552
01:15:38.071 --> 01:15:39.609
She was super careful.

1553
01:15:39.644 --> 01:15:42.106
Her grandfather had
his foot amputated.

1554
01:15:42.141 --> 01:15:43.140
Ow.

1555
01:15:43.175 --> 01:15:44.812
Let me see if it's upstairs.

1556
01:15:44.847 --> 01:15:45.615
Appreciate that.

1557
01:15:48.851 --> 01:15:51.753
Andy. you know you
left the front door open.

1558
01:15:51.788 --> 01:15:55.416
Oh. hi. officers.

1559
01:15:55.451 --> 01:15:59.288
Isn't it great about Andy
not murdering his wife?

1560
01:15:59.323 --> 01:15:59.959
Sure is.

1561
01:15:59.994 --> 01:16:01.994
Yeah.

1562
01:16:02.029 --> 01:16:03.831
Would you like a
drink or some pie?

1563
01:16:03.866 --> 01:16:04.931
No. thank you.

1564
01:16:04.966 --> 01:16:05.833
They're not staying. Cass.

1565
01:16:05.868 --> 01:16:06.460
Thanks.

1566
01:16:06.495 --> 01:16:07.637
OK.

1567
01:16:07.672 --> 01:16:09.397
The kit's not
here. but I know she

1568
01:16:09.432 --> 01:16:10.640
had it because that
morning she went

1569
01:16:10.675 --> 01:16:12.840
out to pick up new test strips.

1570
01:16:12.875 --> 01:16:15.568
Maybe she left it by
accident. was paying.

1571
01:16:15.603 --> 01:16:17.339
got distracted or whatever.

1572
01:16:17.374 --> 01:16:19.605
Yeah. would you have
to know what pharmacy

1573
01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:20.650
Maggie might have used?

1574
01:16:20.685 --> 01:16:23.576
Bucklin Pharmacy on Thompson.

1575
01:16:23.611 --> 01:16:27.415
Yeah. and it had a monogram.
the kit. her initials. MLM.

1576
01:16:27.450 --> 01:16:28.790
Great.

1577
01:16:28.825 --> 01:16:29.824
Well. thank you for
your time. Mr. Moore.

1578
01:16:29.859 --> 01:16:31.859
Cassie. nice seeing you again.

1579
01:16:31.894 --> 01:16:32.585
Bye.

1580
01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:35.357
Let's go.

1581
01:16:35.392 --> 01:16:37.766
Unexpected.

1582
01:16:37.801 --> 01:16:39.295
Fuck buddies.

1583
01:16:39.330 --> 01:16:40.461
JAY: I already
dealt with you guys.

1584
01:16:40.496 --> 01:16:41.198
It's taken care of.

1585
01:16:41.233 --> 01:16:42.133
It's done.

1586
01:16:42.168 --> 01:16:42.936
Dealt with this how?

1587
01:16:42.971 --> 01:16:44.300
Like four days ago.

1588
01:16:44.335 --> 01:16:45.807
One of your cronies.
we worked it all out.

1589
01:16:45.842 --> 01:16:47.336
Customer. Greg!

1590
01:16:47.371 --> 01:16:49.338
No one from the
Castle corporate office

1591
01:16:49.373 --> 01:16:50.713
was here four days ago.

1592
01:16:50.748 --> 01:16:52.979
Don't fucking tell
me no one was here.

1593
01:16:53.014 --> 01:16:55.718
Greg. customer!

1594
01:16:55.753 --> 01:16:57.379
Jesus.

1595
01:16:57.414 --> 01:17:01.724
Carlson. greasy
hair. bad breath.

1596
01:17:01.759 --> 01:17:03.825
That's not our company card.

1597
01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:05.156
That's our company card.

1598
01:17:08.524 --> 01:17:09.160
JAY: What?

1599
01:17:12.066 --> 01:17:15.562
Clearly. you've been using
outside and. in many cases.

1600
01:17:15.597 --> 01:17:16.838
rancid product.

1601
01:17:16.873 --> 01:17:18.202
Well. why would--

1602
01:17:18.237 --> 01:17:20.633
Greg.

1603
01:17:20.668 --> 01:17:22.107
Where the fuck are you?

1604
01:17:31.679 --> 01:17:32.755
That little fucker.

1605
01:17:37.685 --> 01:17:40.191
Hey. hey. Mr.
Connors. I'm so sorry

1606
01:17:40.226 --> 01:17:41.764
about that misunderstanding.

1607
01:17:41.799 --> 01:17:44.833
On the upside. not
all your customers

1608
01:17:44.868 --> 01:17:46.593
have come down with E coli.

1609
01:17:46.628 --> 01:17:47.770
You know what?

1610
01:17:47.805 --> 01:17:50.003
Mr. Connors. I
just lost my wife.

1611
01:17:50.038 --> 01:17:51.840
You maybe read about
it in the papers.

1612
01:17:51.875 --> 01:17:55.602
We are shutting you down
effective immediately.

1613
01:17:55.637 --> 01:17:58.044
Do not touch that.

1614
01:17:58.079 --> 01:18:02.015
And don't ignore
our lawyer's call.

1615
01:18:02.050 --> 01:18:07.856
It would have a monogram
on it. MLM. Maggie Lee Moore.

1616
01:18:07.891 --> 01:18:09.253
Even if she did
leave it. I don't

1617
01:18:09.288 --> 01:18:10.859
see how it changes anything.

1618
01:18:10.894 --> 01:18:13.554
It would just help to
explain one damn inconsistency.

1619
01:18:13.589 --> 01:18:15.457
Sorry. nothing like that.

1620
01:18:15.492 --> 01:18:16.623
If it turns up.
I'll let you know.

1621
01:18:16.658 --> 01:18:17.294
Thank you.

1622
01:18:17.329 --> 01:18:18.900
Thank you. sir.

1623
01:18:18.935 --> 01:18:21.133
Hey. I didn't
mean to eavesdrop.

1624
01:18:21.168 --> 01:18:24.037
but I heard you were
talking about Maggie Moore.

1625
01:18:24.072 --> 01:18:25.368
I'm not sure which one.

1626
01:18:25.403 --> 01:18:27.535
I know they both passed.
like super bizarre.

1627
01:18:27.570 --> 01:18:28.272
Maggie Lee Moore.

1628
01:18:28.307 --> 01:18:29.075
Why?

1629
01:18:29.110 --> 01:18:30.472
Did you help her?

1630
01:18:30.507 --> 01:18:33.948
No. but the husband of
the first one who died--

1631
01:18:33.983 --> 01:18:35.741
yeah. it was the
first one-- he was

1632
01:18:35.776 --> 01:18:37.380
in here just making a purchase.

1633
01:18:37.415 --> 01:18:38.788
So I asked if he
had a loyalty card.

1634
01:18:38.823 --> 01:18:40.152
and he said he wasn't sure.

1635
01:18:40.187 --> 01:18:41.989
So I looked it up in
the system. and that's

1636
01:18:42.024 --> 01:18:43.991
when I saw that there
were two Maggie Moores.

1637
01:18:44.026 --> 01:18:45.652
But for some reason.
the system had

1638
01:18:45.687 --> 01:18:49.062
both Maggie Moore's under
the first one's phone number.

1639
01:18:49.097 --> 01:18:51.262
So you're saying
that Maggie Moore's

1640
01:18:51.297 --> 01:18:55.937
husband found out that there was
another Maggie Moore from you.

1641
01:18:55.972 --> 01:19:00.172
Yes. that is what I'm saying.

1642
01:19:00.207 --> 01:19:01.811
Freaky. right?

1643
01:19:01.846 --> 01:19:04.341
Did he ever come back in
here after his wife was killed?

1644
01:19:04.376 --> 01:19:06.816
Yeah. always bought
beer. always bought

1645
01:19:06.851 --> 01:19:08.345
snacks and the prepaid phones.

1646
01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:09.676
Oh. and Mega Ball.

1647
01:19:09.711 --> 01:19:10.820
Prepaid phones?

1648
01:19:10.855 --> 01:19:13.680
Yeah. like two at a time.

1649
01:19:13.715 --> 01:19:14.923
I was going to
ask. like. what do

1650
01:19:14.958 --> 01:19:16.452
you do with all
those phones. but he

1651
01:19:16.487 --> 01:19:17.992
didn't really like to chitchat.

1652
01:19:18.027 --> 01:19:23.195
Some people just don't.
you know. like to chitchat.

1653
01:19:23.230 --> 01:19:24.834
Yeah. I've heard
that about some people.

1654
01:19:30.501 --> 01:19:35.141
OK. well. Sammy. thank
you so much for your help.

1655
01:19:35.176 --> 01:19:36.439
You have yourself
a very nice day.

1656
01:19:36.474 --> 01:19:37.176
Thank you very much.

1657
01:19:37.211 --> 01:19:37.847
You. too.

1658
01:19:43.415 --> 01:19:45.811
Think Sammy and I are
wondering what Jay Moore

1659
01:19:45.846 --> 01:19:47.615
is doing with all those phones.

1660
01:19:47.650 --> 01:19:50.321
Yep.

1661
01:19:50.356 --> 01:19:51.751
[knocking]

1662
01:19:54.195 --> 01:19:56.525
He's not at home
or at the shop.

1663
01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:58.659
No.

1664
01:19:58.694 --> 01:20:00.463
Uh-oh.

1665
01:20:00.498 --> 01:20:03.565
I think I left
something in the car.

1666
01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:05.974
Deputy.

1667
01:20:06.009 --> 01:20:07.668
Are you avoiding me?

1668
01:20:07.703 --> 01:20:08.669
Of course not.

1669
01:20:08.704 --> 01:20:09.835
I'm here on police business.

1670
01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:11.078
Bullshit.

1671
01:20:11.113 --> 01:20:13.575
Can't you just get over this?

1672
01:20:13.610 --> 01:20:15.379
I don't know if I can. Rita.

1673
01:20:15.414 --> 01:20:18.217
Sorry. just being honest.

1674
01:20:18.252 --> 01:20:22.386
He means nothing to
me. like zero. less than.

1675
01:20:22.421 --> 01:20:25.191
It's not like me and
you were doing it.

1676
01:20:25.226 --> 01:20:26.588
Did you tell him it was over?

1677
01:20:26.623 --> 01:20:28.392
Did you end it with him.
like you said you would?

1678
01:20:28.427 --> 01:20:29.756
That's not what I said.

1679
01:20:29.791 --> 01:20:31.692
I said I would end it
if you wanted me to.

1680
01:20:31.727 --> 01:20:34.035
Rita. come on.

1681
01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:36.235
Don't you have any say
in your own life at all?

1682
01:20:41.638 --> 01:20:43.803
It must be nice to see
everything so clearly.

1683
01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:50.876
If you don't mind my saying--

1684
01:20:50.911 --> 01:20:53.956
Can you just not?

1685
01:20:53.991 --> 01:20:55.452
Thank you.

1686
01:20:55.487 --> 01:20:58.422
[upbeat music]

1687
01:21:08.764 --> 01:21:11.534
Did you think you can
play me. motherfucker?

1688

[screaming]

1689
01:21:13.076 --> 01:21:16.473
Where's my 600.
you little bitch?

1690
01:21:16.508 --> 01:21:17.474
Where's my money?

1691
01:21:24.417 --> 01:21:25.482
Oh. my God.

1692
01:21:25.517 --> 01:21:27.286
Someone call 911!

1693
01:21:27.321 --> 01:21:29.156
Get help!

1694
01:21:29.191 --> 01:21:29.783
It's OK.

Huh.

1699
01:21:45.867 --> 01:21:47.636
Did anonymous say
where they found this?

1700
01:21:47.671 --> 01:21:50.771
No. but these texts
that we pulled off

1701
01:21:50.806 --> 01:21:51.772

Anonymous note with
an anonymous phone

01:21:57.483 --> 01:21:58.812
and some anonymous texts.

1704
01:21:58.847 --> 01:22:00.121
Any fingerprints?

1705

Clean as a whistle.

Don't speak in

It's very lazy.

1708
01:22:05.854 --> 01:22:07.491
We traced the serial number.

1709
01:22:07.526 --> 01:22:11.627
And guess which local drugstore
sold this particular phone?

1710
01:22:11.662 --> 01:22:15.169
Bucklin Pharmacy on Thompson.

1711
01:22:15.204 --> 01:22:18.469
Go pick up Jay. right?

1712
01:22:18.504 --> 01:22:21.043
Not yet.

1713
01:22:21.078 --> 01:22:24.508
I talked to one guy. one
fucking guy. and he's a Fed?

1714
01:22:24.543 --> 01:22:26.444
You thought he was
12. Tommy T. so let's

1715
01:22:26.479 --> 01:22:28.842
not blame it on a bad break.

1716
01:22:28.877 --> 01:22:29.843
Texts.

1717
01:22:29.878 --> 01:22:30.976
They're not mine.

1718
01:22:31.011 --> 01:22:32.879
Are they Jay Moore's?

1719
01:22:32.914 --> 01:22:34.881
Maybe.

1720
01:22:34.916 --> 01:22:36.817
Maybe you guys can help me out.

1721
01:22:36.852 --> 01:22:39.622
You know what they do
to guys like me in here?

1722
01:22:39.657 --> 01:22:40.722
Pedophiles?

1723
01:22:40.757 --> 01:22:42.460
Yeah.

1724
01:22:42.495 --> 01:22:44.825
The pedophiles get castrated
usually with a rusty homemade

1725
01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:45.793
shiv of some kind.

1726
01:22:45.828 --> 01:22:47.531
Well. you'll see.

1727
01:22:47.566 --> 01:22:49.962
So you can let Duane Rich take
the fall for both Maggie Moore

1728
01:22:49.997 --> 01:22:52.338
murders and stay in here and
get castrated with the rest

1729
01:22:52.373 --> 01:22:54.901
of the pedophiles.

1730
01:22:54.936 --> 01:22:56.573
Or?

1731
01:22:56.608 --> 01:22:58.905
Or what?

1732
01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:00.907
What. is there no fucking or?

1733
01:23:00.942 --> 01:23:04.317
Or maybe you know
more about these texts

1734
01:23:04.352 --> 01:23:06.055
than you're letting on.

1735
01:23:06.090 --> 01:23:08.156
Well. can you guys
get me out of here?

1736
01:23:08.191 --> 01:23:11.720
You know. grant me at least
some kind of invulnerability?

1737
01:23:11.755 --> 01:23:14.195
No. no. no. you're
a disgrace to society.

1738
01:23:14.230 --> 01:23:17.231
Tommy T. and a menace. too.

1739
01:23:17.266 --> 01:23:20.069
We-- can talk to the DA.

1740
01:23:20.104 --> 01:23:23.369
Maybe they'll knock a few
years off of what's going to be

1741

1742

Extremely long
sentence with no dick.

1743
01:23:33.579 --> 01:23:34.281
What do you think?

1744
01:23:37.550 --> 01:23:40.287
There's this tough guy.

1745
01:23:40.322 --> 01:23:42.586
Well. you wanted
to tie up loose ends.

1746
01:23:42.621 --> 01:23:45.523
Now all we've got is more
loose ends that need tying.

1747
01:23:45.558 --> 01:23:47.129
I don't disagree.

1748
01:23:47.164 --> 01:23:48.625
Except for the
fact that we actually

1749
01:23:48.660 --> 01:23:49.923
have a confessed murderer.

1750
01:23:49.958 --> 01:23:51.430
I mean. that end is
tight as it gets.

1751
01:23:51.465 --> 01:23:52.728
Nothing loose about it.

1752
01:23:52.763 --> 01:23:54.301
So what do you propose we do?

1753
01:23:54.336 --> 01:23:55.203
Who. me?

1754
01:23:55.238 --> 01:23:56.105
You want my opinion?

1755
01:23:56.140 --> 01:23:57.271
Yes. I want your opinion.

1756
01:23:57.306 --> 01:23:59.064
You're a damn fine
police officer.

1757
01:23:59.099 --> 01:24:00.703
Obviously. we've got to
check the deaf guy out.

1758
01:24:00.738 --> 01:24:01.440
I don't disagree.

1759
01:24:12.255 --> 01:24:13.716

1760
01:24:13.751 --> 01:24:14.354

01:25:29.332 --> 01:25:30.397
Did he take anything?

1785
01:25:30.432 --> 01:25:33.367
Anything you might
want to report?

1786
01:25:33.402 --> 01:25:35.864
DON: Well. he
polished off my beer.

1787
01:25:35.899 --> 01:25:37.503
And like I said. he
trashed the place.

1788
01:25:37.538 --> 01:25:41.166
but everything seems to be here.

1789
01:25:41.201 --> 01:25:43.410
Well. sorry to bother
you. Mr. Linkowski.

1790
01:25:43.445 --> 01:25:45.577
Lindowski.

1791
01:25:45.612 --> 01:25:46.974
Lindowski.

1792
01:25:47.009 --> 01:25:49.845
We'll send somebody
by to dust for prints.

1793
01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:51.352
We obviously want
to catch this guy.

1794
01:25:51.387 --> 01:25:53.486
Yeah. just give us a
call if he shows back up.

1795
01:25:53.521 --> 01:25:55.323
I will do.

1796
01:25:55.358 --> 01:25:57.721
You fellas take care.

1797
01:25:57.756 --> 01:25:58.623
Thank you for your time.

1798
01:26:07.634 --> 01:26:09.238
Just me or did you also
get the heebie jeebies?

1799
01:26:09.273 --> 01:26:11.273
That's our guy.

1800
01:26:11.308 --> 01:26:13.671
I saw Maggie's insulin
kit in there on the table.

1801
01:26:13.706 --> 01:26:16.674
the monogrammed one. MLM.

1802
01:26:16.709 --> 01:26:17.246

Oh!

1819
01:27:42.399 --> 01:27:43.156
You gave me up?

1820
01:27:43.191 --> 01:27:43.827
Oh!

1821
01:27:49.637 --> 01:27:50.339
Huh?

1822
01:27:50.374 --> 01:27:51.164
Ow!

1823
01:27:51.199 --> 01:27:51.835
Oh!

1824
01:27:56.237 --> 01:27:57.643
The cops were at my place.

1825
01:27:57.678 --> 01:28:01.779
No fucking way. not from me.

1826
01:28:01.814 --> 01:28:04.045
Why did you fake being deaf?

1827
01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:06.553
I like to know what
people are saying about me.

1828
01:28:06.588 --> 01:28:07.983
Demented fuck.

can't talk right now.

1832
01:28:21.702 --> 01:28:22.503
Somebody just shot Jay!

1833
01:28:22.538 --> 01:28:23.372
I just know it.

1834
01:28:23.407 --> 01:28:24.967
I saw it. and he saw me.

1835
01:28:25.002 --> 01:28:26.408
I want you to get out of
your house. get into your car.

1836
01:28:26.443 --> 01:28:27.475
get out of there right now.

1837
01:28:27.510 --> 01:28:28.069
Now!

1838
01:28:48.190 --> 01:28:49.057

1839
01:28:49.092 --> 01:28:49.695
Ah!

1840
01:28:54.394 --> 01:28:54.964
Drive.

1841
01:29:07.209 --> 01:29:08.208
Three choices.

1842
01:29:08.243 --> 01:29:09.715
You die in two of them.

1843
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:11.013
Touch the brake. dead.

1844
01:29:11.048 --> 01:29:12.784
Do anything but what
I tell you. dead.

1845
01:29:12.819 --> 01:29:14.885
Third choice. you go home alive.

No. you're not.

1878

SANDERS: Someone once told him
it took courage to be happy.

1879
01:30:54.558 --> 01:30:57.724
He didn't understand it then.
but he thinks he might now.

1880
01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:04.533
The problem. he realized.
is all the heartbreak.

1881
01:31:04.568 --> 01:31:06.227
For some. it comes
more often than others.

1882
01:31:06.262 --> 01:31:10.935
but he knew well it
comes for everyone.

1883
01:31:14.776 --> 01:31:16.875
The irony was how the
heartbreak somehow

1884
01:31:16.910 --> 01:31:22.980
made his own life
clearer. showed him

1885
01:31:23.015 --> 01:31:25.620
a path to the happiness he'd
been so desperate to find.

1886
01:31:29.725 --> 01:31:32.220
Obviously. not everyone
has that difficult a time.

1887
01:31:32.255 --> 01:31:35.762
Some people are born
happy and stay happy.

1888
01:31:35.797 --> 01:31:40.162
And to those people. he
thought. good for them.

1889
01:31:40.197 --> 01:31:40.800
What a gift.

1890
01:31:43.904 --> 01:31:48.071
For others. he knew.
it's just the opposite.

1891
01:31:48.106 --> 01:31:53.241
They fight. losing battle
after losing battle.

1892
01:31:53.276 --> 01:31:57.113
until. finally.
they lose the war.

1893
01:31:57.148 --> 01:32:01.755
The rest. the majority even.
it's a constant struggle.

1894
01:32:01.790 --> 01:32:05.451
Some days good. some
days not so good.

1895
01:32:05.486 --> 01:32:07.728
They keep at it. though.
wake up each morning.

1896
01:32:07.763 --> 01:32:10.599
hoping to catch lightning
in a bottle. which

1897
01:32:10.634 --> 01:32:13.866
he knew was a cliche.
but also believed

1898
01:32:13.901 --> 01:32:16.363
that's what happiness was.

1899
01:32:16.398 --> 01:32:19.432
The sad thing was when he
realized too late that he

1900
01:32:19.467 --> 01:32:22.776
had once held the bottle.

1901
01:32:22.811 --> 01:32:25.108
He held that bottle
right in his hands

1902
01:32:25.143 --> 01:32:28.980
with a lightning
buzzing around inside.

1903
01:32:29.015 --> 01:32:34.315
He was just too stupid or
too foolish or too proud

1904
01:32:34.350 --> 01:32:39.320
to realize it. and he
let it get away from him.

1905
01:32:39.355 --> 01:32:43.390
So was that another
heartbreak. or another part

1906
01:32:43.425 --> 01:32:45.997
of the struggle?

1907
01:32:46.032 --> 01:32:48.967
The truth is. he
didn't know yet.

1908
01:32:52.269 --> 01:32:57.745
He just knew it would take
some courage to find out.

1911
01:36:48.835 --> 01:36:52.243
(SINGING) I told the
stars and the sky

1912
01:36:52.278 --> 01:36:57.248
are blue. just the
way that I love you.

1913
01:36:57.283 --> 01:37:02.187
This is what they set
to do. build a bungalow.

1914
01:37:02.222 --> 01:37:04.726
build a honeymoon house for two.

1915
01:37:07.788 --> 01:37:11.493
I talked to the tree.
the tall oak tree.

1916
01:37:11.528 --> 01:37:14.694
Here's what the tall
tree said to me.

1917
01:37:14.729 --> 01:37:19.908
My very best advice to
you. build a bungalow.

1918
01:37:19.943 --> 01:37:22.603
build a honeymoon house for two.

1919
01:37:25.641 --> 01:37:36.353
Birds and bees. rivers
and trees. skies are blue.

1920
01:37:36.388 --> 01:37:39.961
say you love me. too.

1921
01:37:39.996 --> 01:37:43.591
I saw two bluebirds
sitting in a tree.

Here's what the
bluebird said to me.

1923
01:37:47.267 --> 01:37:50.631
Build a nest like lovebirds do.

1924
01:37:50.666 --> 01:37:54.569
Build a bungalow. build a
honeymoon house for two.

1925
01:37:57.574 --> 01:38:01.081
I talked to the
river deep and wide.

1926
01:38:01.116 --> 01:38:04.579
I told it how I feel inside.

1927
01:38:04.614 --> 01:38:08.154
It told me just
what I should do.

1928
01:38:08.189 --> 01:38:12.356
Build a bungalow. build a
honeymoon house for two.

1929
01:38:16.197 --> 01:38:23.598
I believe the stars
that cover the sky.

1930
01:38:23.633 --> 01:38:27.866
I believe in the moon up above.

1931
01:38:30.508 --> 01:38:37.348
I believe God made
them for you and I

1932
01:38:37.383 --> 01:38:43.684
to dream on as we fell in love.

1933
01:38:43.719 --> 01:38:50.427
I believe in dreams
for dreams come true.

1934
01:38:50.462 --> 01:38:53.859
I believe in dreams.

1936
01:38:56.963 --> 01:39:07.983
I believe your love for me is
true because I believe in you.
