00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:47.913
[music continues]

3
00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:29.154
- Maghreb...

4
00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:33.559
My beloved Shahzadi...

5
00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:38.197
I fear my time is short
and I must secure the realm.

6
00:01:40.768 --> 00:01:44.303
My loyal adviser. Maghreb.

7
00:01:44.305 --> 00:01:47.840
you have long served
our people as their Vizier.

8
00:01:47.842 --> 00:01:51.577
And I can think of no other
to fill your shoes as well.

9
00:01:52.947 --> 00:01:54.446
- Thank you. my Sultan.

10
00:01:54.448 --> 00:01:57.649
My only wish is to continue
to serve our people.

11
00:01:58.986 --> 00:02:00.352
- And so you shall.

12
00:02:00.354 --> 00:02:04.289
Maghreb. you shall
continue your role

13
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:07.559
as most wise and
trusted counselor.

14
00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:11.463
Upon my death.
Princess Shahzadi

15
00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:15.734
shall rule as
Sultana of Baghdad.

16
00:02:15.736 --> 00:02:17.102
Allah's will be done.

17
00:02:18.906 --> 00:02:20.372
- No!

18
00:02:20.374 --> 00:02:21.507
No!

19
00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:23.142
It is my turn!

20
00:02:23.144 --> 00:02:24.343
It is my right!

21
00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:27.846
No woman has ever
led our people!

22
00:02:27.848 --> 00:02:30.115
It would be...
It would be an abomination!

23
00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:34.086
- It is my wish and my command!

24
00:02:35.823 --> 00:02:38.123
Shahzadi has
proven her worth

25
00:02:38.125 --> 00:02:40.626
and our commitment
to our people.

26
00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:43.829
Times change.

27
00:02:43.831 --> 00:02:48.000
She has earned the right
to rule in my stead.

28
00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:50.202
So it shall be.

29
00:02:52.406 --> 00:02:54.406
- This... This is sacrilege!

30
00:02:55.543 --> 00:02:56.775
Out of my way!

31
00:03:00.014 --> 00:03:03.282
- He can be
a trifle troublesome.

32
00:03:03.284 --> 00:03:07.419
But my daughter.
you will manage.

33
00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:14.860
[speaking foreign language]

34
00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:23.535
- By the power given
to me by the Dark Ones.

35
00:03:23.537 --> 00:03:26.572
I command you to come to me!

36
00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:32.678
Here you are.

37
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.447
Mine. all mine.

38
00:03:38.652 --> 00:03:39.985
[grunts]

39
00:03:39.987 --> 00:03:41.620
Still not strong enough!

40
00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.159
Patience. patience.

41
00:03:50.064 --> 00:03:52.130
If you will not come to me.

42
00:03:52.132 --> 00:03:55.033
then I shall brave
the cave alone.

43
00:03:55.035 --> 00:03:58.537
Then we shall see who sits
on top the throne as Sultan.

44
00:04:07.581 --> 00:04:09.982
- My father's favorite garden.

45
00:04:09.984 --> 00:04:13.151
It is fitting that we
honor his memory on this day.

46
00:04:13.153 --> 00:04:14.653
- It is.

47
00:04:14.655 --> 00:04:17.589
For only here.
we will find flowers

48
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:20.158
that match your beauty.
Your Highness.

49
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.693
[chuckles]

50
00:04:21.695 --> 00:04:24.129
- I've already forgiven
your outburst

51
00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:26.198
in my father's chambers.

52
00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:28.600
- And I am grateful.

53
00:04:28.602 --> 00:04:32.104
but my sentiments. they are
sincere. Your Highness.

54
00:04:32.106 --> 00:04:34.239
- Flowery flattery. Vizier.

55
00:04:35.142 --> 00:04:36.508
- Honest praise.

56
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.078
and today. I am just Maghreb.

57
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.548
- Yes! It is nice to loosen
the restraints of office

58
00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.817
once in a while. is it not?

59
00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:47.286
- Yes. it is.

60
00:04:47.288 --> 00:04:50.656
Perhaps we can do
this more often...

61
00:04:50.658 --> 00:04:52.424
- Look! There!

62
00:04:55.829 --> 00:04:58.063
I love acrobats.

63
00:04:58.065 --> 00:05:00.899
- Mindless little monkey men.

64
00:05:04.872 --> 00:05:06.338
[applause]

65
00:05:26.894 --> 00:05:29.661
- I thought Baghdad was
supposed to be generous.

66
00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:31.663
- You just got here.
Give them time.

67
00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:34.599
- A city in celebration
is a city with money.

68
00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:37.903
- And I'm certain some will
find its way into our hands.

69
00:05:46.246 --> 00:05:47.245
- Help! Fire!

70
00:05:47.247 --> 00:05:49.581
Somebody put it out. quick!

71
00:05:49.583 --> 00:05:51.083
- Oh. no!
The fireworks have set alight!

72
00:05:51.085 --> 00:05:52.718
Help!

73
00:06:06.734 --> 00:06:08.100
[applause]

74
00:06:08.102 --> 00:06:09.334
- Oh!

75
00:06:22.916 --> 00:06:24.750
- Stop! Thief!

76
00:06:24.752 --> 00:06:26.585
Help! Help!

77
00:06:39.133 --> 00:06:40.932
- Most impressive!

78
00:06:42.803 --> 00:06:45.670
I should like
to reward that young man.

79
00:06:48.208 --> 00:06:50.041
- Indeed.

80
00:06:50.043 --> 00:06:51.610
Most impressive.

81
00:07:02.156 --> 00:07:03.855
- Oh. thank you!

82
00:07:03.857 --> 00:07:05.524
- All in a day's work.
my friend.

83
00:07:05.526 --> 00:07:08.894
Oh. speaking of which...
- Eh?

84
00:07:08.896 --> 00:07:10.862
- I was in the middle of mine
when all this happened.

85
00:07:10.864 --> 00:07:14.833
So perhaps you could
see your way to...

86
00:07:14.835 --> 00:07:17.702
- Are you suggesting I pay you
for doing me a favor?

87
00:07:17.704 --> 00:07:20.505
- The Koran says do good deeds

88
00:07:20.507 --> 00:07:22.541
and the rewards of
paradise await.

89
00:07:22.543 --> 00:07:24.209
But in the meantime...

90
00:07:24.211 --> 00:07:25.477
- In the meantime?

91
00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:28.079
I don't recall
reading that part!

92
00:07:28.081 --> 00:07:30.182
- Well. it certainly ought to
be in there. don't you think?

93
00:07:30.184 --> 00:07:31.349
- No!

94
00:07:31.351 --> 00:07:33.185
- Um...

95
00:07:33.187 --> 00:07:34.186
- Unhand me!

96
00:07:34.188 --> 00:07:35.587
- Ahem!

97
00:07:37.991 --> 00:07:39.558
- A mistake.

98
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.293
It's not at all what
it looks like.

99
00:07:41.295 --> 00:07:43.628
- Fairly sure it's exactly
what it looks like.

100
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.397
but not my concern.

101
00:07:45.399 --> 00:07:47.666
Someone wishes to have
a word with you.

102
00:07:52.406 --> 00:07:54.206
- My fortune has
seemed to change.

103
00:07:54.208 --> 00:07:57.142
- Your capture of the thief
was most impressive.

104
00:07:57.144 --> 00:07:58.477
[scoffs]

105
00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:01.012
What is your name. Acrobat?

106
00:08:03.784 --> 00:08:05.317
- Aladdin.

107
00:08:05.319 --> 00:08:08.620
- Forgive me.
I did not hear you.

108
00:08:11.191 --> 00:08:12.991
- Aladdin. my lady.

109
00:08:14.094 --> 00:08:16.061
- You may approach. Aladdin.

110
00:08:17.598 --> 00:08:19.331
[chuckles]

111
00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:22.033
I don't bite. Aladdin.

112
00:08:22.035 --> 00:08:24.936
Come here. please?

113
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:33.712
This charm has been
in my family for many years.

114
00:08:34.581 --> 00:08:37.549
It has protected me from evil

115
00:08:37.551 --> 00:08:40.552
and now it shall protect you.

116
00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:47.425
- It is too much. my lady.

117
00:08:47.427 --> 00:08:48.927
- He's most certainly right.

118
00:08:48.929 --> 00:08:50.795
It's far too much.
Your Highness.

119
00:08:50.797 --> 00:08:54.199
- Your bravery deserves reward

120
00:08:55.802 --> 00:08:58.003
and I want you to have this.

121
00:09:13.554 --> 00:09:16.855
A pleasure to meet you.
Acrobats...

122
00:09:17.858 --> 00:09:18.924
Aladdin.

123
00:09:32.439 --> 00:09:34.539
[gasps]

124
00:09:36.677 --> 00:09:38.176
- What just happened?

125
00:09:38.178 --> 00:09:39.611
- Do you honestly not know?

126
00:09:39.613 --> 00:09:42.013
- Allah has given him eyes
and he doth not see.

127
00:09:42.015 --> 00:09:45.116
- Stop that.
You're not a holy man.

128
00:09:45.118 --> 00:09:47.552
- Words of the righteous
may fall from any lip.

129
00:09:47.554 --> 00:09:52.857
- Aladdin. do you not know why
this city is celebrating today?

130
00:09:52.859 --> 00:09:55.427
- One Sultan goes.
another Sultan comes.

131
00:09:55.429 --> 00:09:56.628
What of it?

132
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:59.798
- Not Sultan.
Sultana.

133
00:10:00.434 --> 00:10:02.500
[uplifting music plays]

134
00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.540
- Yes. you fool.

135
00:10:08.542 --> 00:10:11.443
You just met
the ruler of Baghdad.

136
00:10:11.445 --> 00:10:12.644
- Wait!

137
00:10:14.481 --> 00:10:15.947
How could I miss that?

138
00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:17.616
- Well. perhaps the charms
on her wrist

139
00:10:17.618 --> 00:10:19.851
weren't the only charms
you were focused on.

140
00:10:19.853 --> 00:10:21.419
- I was thinking that myself.

141
00:10:21.421 --> 00:10:24.122
- I was thinking she seemed
to like Acrobat Aladdin.

142
00:10:24.124 --> 00:10:25.790
- I was thinking
that myself. too.

143
00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:27.359
- You're both mad.

144
00:10:27.361 --> 00:10:29.027
She was...

145
00:10:29.029 --> 00:10:31.096
She was merely toying
with a peasant.

146
00:10:31.098 --> 00:10:33.131
[laughs]

147
00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:35.200
- Peasants don't get
silver gifts.

148
00:10:35.202 --> 00:10:37.702
Deeper currents run
in this river.

149
00:10:37.704 --> 00:10:40.705
- Allah hath said...
- Stop it!

150
00:10:49.182 --> 00:10:53.018
- My friends. give me a moment
to gather my thoughts.

151
00:10:54.655 --> 00:10:55.854
I'll be back.

152
00:11:06.867 --> 00:11:09.367
- I assume by now
you know who I am.

153
00:11:09.369 --> 00:11:11.903
- Greetings. Vizier.

154
00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:15.040
- Well met. Acrobat.

155
00:11:15.042 --> 00:11:16.875
- Aladdin.

156
00:11:18.779 --> 00:11:21.346
- You know. the palace
could use a man like you

157
00:11:21.348 --> 00:11:26.317
with such skills and
talents. Acrobat.

158
00:11:26.319 --> 00:11:29.087
- I've already received
my payment from the palace.

159
00:11:31.725 --> 00:11:34.793
- A man such as yourself
does not work for charity.

160
00:11:34.795 --> 00:11:36.895
- A man such as me?

161
00:11:38.298 --> 00:11:40.098
- A real man earns his way.

162
00:11:41.601 --> 00:11:46.738
I offer a task and the payment
is far greater than the award.

163
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.940
- What could be worth
more than that?

164
00:11:50.377 --> 00:11:55.780
- Perhaps an invitation to
an audience with the Sultana?

165
00:11:57.784 --> 00:11:59.050
- The Sultana?

166
00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:01.152
- Mmm.
Why. it is she who needs you.

167
00:12:01.154 --> 00:12:04.789
a man with your talents
and skills. young man.

168
00:12:05.826 --> 00:12:07.425
- An acrobat. it seems.

169
00:12:07.427 --> 00:12:08.693
[chuckles]

170
00:12:08.695 --> 00:12:10.628
- Just so. just so.

171
00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.163
Assist me in
completing this task

172
00:12:12.165 --> 00:12:13.965
and I shall promptly escort you
to the palace

173
00:12:13.967 --> 00:12:17.202
where you can pick up
where you left off.

174
00:12:19.573 --> 00:12:22.741
She saw a very brave and
resourceful young man today.

175
00:12:22.743 --> 00:12:25.844
one that certainly
piqued her interest.

176
00:12:27.681 --> 00:12:29.180
Now come.

177
00:12:29.182 --> 00:12:31.683
We must reach our destination
before the moon is full.

178
00:12:34.488 --> 00:12:35.820
[chuckles]

179
00:12:35.822 --> 00:12:38.957
My friends. they need me.
Our act...

180
00:12:38.959 --> 00:12:41.659
- Currently Sultana needs you

181
00:12:41.661 --> 00:12:44.028
and she awaits our return.

182
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:47.832
Now come.
We must leave at once.

183
00:13:03.784 --> 00:13:05.216
- First he's flirting
with princesses.

184
00:13:05.218 --> 00:13:06.951
Now he's riding with royalty?

185
00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:08.620
- Are Viziers royal?

186
00:13:08.622 --> 00:13:10.388
- Do they arrest
you for flirting?

187
00:13:11.625 --> 00:13:13.124
- He doesn't look arrested.

188
00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:15.093
- He doesn't look happy either.

189
00:13:15.929 --> 00:13:17.162
Something is going on.

190
00:13:17.164 --> 00:13:19.831
- When Allah directs
a strong wind.

191
00:13:19.833 --> 00:13:22.133
a man must sail that course.

192
00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:24.068
- Guys. we gotta
go grab horses and follow...

193
00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:25.270
- Follow them. agreed!

194
00:13:30.577 --> 00:13:32.243
[horse whinnies]

195
00:13:34.881 --> 00:13:37.649
- Truly a desolate wasteland.

196
00:13:37.651 --> 00:13:39.484
I thought there
was nothing out here.

197
00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:45.056
- The desert holds many.
many secrets. Acrobat.

198
00:13:46.293 --> 00:13:48.293
- Aladdin.

199
00:13:48.295 --> 00:13:49.294
My name is Aladdin.

200
00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:52.997
- Names and titles
are interchangeable

201
00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:55.967
and unimportant. I say.

202
00:14:02.843 --> 00:14:04.909
[horses neigh]

203
00:14:04.911 --> 00:14:07.378
- So. Vizier. what do
you require of me?

204
00:14:11.785 --> 00:14:13.384
- Demon!

205
00:14:13.386 --> 00:14:14.686
[chuckles]

206
00:14:14.688 --> 00:14:16.187
- Vessel.
Vessel. boy.

207
00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:18.523
The will of Allah
runs through me.

208
00:14:18.525 --> 00:14:21.826
I am but a holy man
carrying out His will.

209
00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:26.231
- What does he wish?

210
00:14:27.534 --> 00:14:31.035
- Inside. there is
a caravan of treasure.

211
00:14:31.037 --> 00:14:33.504
a cache of wealth that
has been carried down

212
00:14:33.506 --> 00:14:37.041
from Sultan to Sultan
since time immemorial.

213
00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:39.344
- I always wondered
where the money came from.

214
00:14:40.881 --> 00:14:42.647
There's a lamp.

215
00:14:42.649 --> 00:14:45.550
It represent the Sultana's
right to rule.

216
00:14:45.552 --> 00:14:47.652
You must retrieve the lamp
and bring it to her immediately

217
00:14:47.654 --> 00:14:48.887
so that she may bless it.

218
00:14:48.889 --> 00:14:51.723
Then we return the lamp
so it will await

219
00:14:51.725 --> 00:14:53.491
its next eventual ruler.

220
00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:59.230
There are obstacles
inside the cave.

221
00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:01.566
And. unfortunately.
I am too old and beat up

222
00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:03.935
to contend with them. so...

223
00:15:03.937 --> 00:15:07.572
Now this staff
will light your way.

224
00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:11.476
And this rope will help
you with said obstacles.

225
00:15:11.478 --> 00:15:13.011
Simply unwind it

226
00:15:13.013 --> 00:15:16.648
and place it in any hole
you come across and let it go.

227
00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:18.283
- It will drop.

228
00:15:18.285 --> 00:15:19.484
- You must return
before moonset.

229
00:15:19.486 --> 00:15:21.252
for that is when
the cave will close

230
00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:23.721
and I will be unable to open it
until the next full moon.

231
00:15:23.723 --> 00:15:27.825
- I will have some tales to tell
the Sultana when we return.

232
00:15:27.827 --> 00:15:29.560
- Yes. yes. yes.
Yes. you shall.

233
00:15:29.562 --> 00:15:31.296
Now go. please.

234
00:15:50.784 --> 00:15:52.317
- He said let it go and drop.

235
00:15:55.889 --> 00:15:58.056
By the Prophet!

236
00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:11.102
[bats squeaking]

237
00:16:18.345 --> 00:16:20.011
[grunts]

238
00:16:20.914 --> 00:16:22.513
Oh...

239
00:17:06.426 --> 00:17:08.226
[sighs]

240
00:18:01.314 --> 00:18:04.315
So every new Sultan or
Vizier makes this trip?

241
00:18:09.189 --> 00:18:11.756
Again with the fire?

242
00:18:18.465 --> 00:18:19.630
[grunts]

243
00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:28.733
A man could spend a lifetime
trying to find the real lamp.

244
00:19:30.703 --> 00:19:32.203
Apparently. someone did.

245
00:19:49.522 --> 00:19:52.557
The light of knowledge destroys
the darkness of ignorance.

246
00:19:56.196 --> 00:19:57.662
[chuckles]

247
00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.427
Finally.

248
00:20:51.718 --> 00:20:52.717
Oh!

249
00:21:14.107 --> 00:21:15.840
Vizier!

250
00:21:19.178 --> 00:21:20.645
[grunts]

251
00:21:22.148 --> 00:21:23.381
Vizier!

252
00:21:26.819 --> 00:21:28.552
- Thank you... fool!

253
00:21:28.554 --> 00:21:31.489
How dare you touch the
Sultan of Baghdad!

254
00:21:38.131 --> 00:21:39.730
Oh. no!

255
00:21:39.732 --> 00:21:41.866
No! No!

256
00:22:02.488 --> 00:22:04.488
- Where's Aladdin?
- Shh.

257
00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:07.325
We'll follow his tracks
back after he passes.

258
00:22:07.327 --> 00:22:09.460
- Then we need to go now.

259
00:22:19.706 --> 00:22:21.372
[groans]

260
00:22:50.269 --> 00:22:51.502
- There it is.

261
00:22:54.073 --> 00:22:55.973
This makes you Sultan?

262
00:23:23.202 --> 00:23:24.802
- There! Look!

263
00:23:26.139 --> 00:23:28.406
- Like a well-thrown dart
in a game of chance.

264
00:23:28.408 --> 00:23:30.508
The hand of Allah
has guided our steps.

265
00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:32.676
- Thank you. oh. Wise One!

266
00:23:32.678 --> 00:23:35.513
- Enough!
Aladdin needs us.

267
00:23:51.664 --> 00:23:53.364
- Alas. our friend is entombed.

268
00:23:53.366 --> 00:23:54.999
We're too late!

269
00:23:55.001 --> 00:23:56.801
- Already I miss him.

270
00:23:56.803 --> 00:23:59.537
- Already I miss
the 30 drachma he owes me.

271
00:23:59.539 --> 00:24:00.805
- It was only 20!

272
00:24:03.876 --> 00:24:05.443
- By the Prophet!

273
00:24:05.445 --> 00:24:06.811
- Aladdin!

274
00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:11.148
- I knew you were alive.
I tried to tell them.

275
00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:13.751
[laughs]

276
00:24:13.753 --> 00:24:15.486
- First you were enslaved
and then entombed?

277
00:24:15.488 --> 00:24:16.787
How comes this?

278
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:19.290
- I was entombed.
but not enslaved. Samad.

279
00:24:19.292 --> 00:24:21.091
- What of the Vizier?

280
00:24:21.093 --> 00:24:24.361
- It is a story long in
the telling. my friends.

281
00:24:24.363 --> 00:24:26.630
- Then start it properly
at the beginning.

282
00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:37.441
- The lamp still evades us.
my little pet.

283
00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:44.949
But I will be Sultan and
Shahzadi will be my bride.

284
00:24:44.951 --> 00:24:48.786
At moonrise. I retrieve
what is mine!

285
00:24:51.057 --> 00:24:54.492
- And then I catapulted out of
the cave and into your arms.

286
00:24:55.995 --> 00:24:57.962
- Tell me again about
the special lamp?

287
00:24:57.964 --> 00:25:00.898
- It is a symbol of
the Sultan's right to rule.

288
00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.901
The new Sultan or Sultana
must bless it

289
00:25:03.903 --> 00:25:05.703
and then it must be
returned to the cave.

290
00:25:05.705 --> 00:25:07.671
- I've never heard
of such a thing.

291
00:25:07.673 --> 00:25:10.040
And I've lived in
Baghdad my whole life.

292
00:25:10.042 --> 00:25:11.542
- All 23 years of it.

293
00:25:11.544 --> 00:25:14.678
- I agree. There's something
more below the surface here.

294
00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:17.147
- Let's have a look at
the wellspring

295
00:25:17.149 --> 00:25:18.649
of all these woes.

296
00:25:23.789 --> 00:25:26.190
Well. it's definitely a lamp.

297
00:25:26.192 --> 00:25:27.191
- Okay.

298
00:25:28.427 --> 00:25:29.860
It's an ordinary lamp.

299
00:25:29.862 --> 00:25:31.862
- Why would there be
so many traps guarding it?

300
00:25:31.864 --> 00:25:33.230
- Who knows why royals
do anything they do?

301
00:25:33.232 --> 00:25:34.865
I once heard...
- If it's worth something

302
00:25:34.867 --> 00:25:37.268
to the Vizier.
then it's worth something to us.

303
00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:39.069
We could sell it.

304
00:25:42.542 --> 00:25:43.758
- I don't know.

305
00:25:43.759 --> 00:25:44.975
- We used the last of
our coins on the horses.

306
00:25:44.977 --> 00:25:46.443
- And I don't think
the Vizier is going to be

307
00:25:46.445 --> 00:25:47.978
paying you any time soon.

308
00:25:49.382 --> 00:25:51.081
Perhaps you could
sell the charm.

309
00:25:52.485 --> 00:25:55.519
- I'll clean up the lamp.
then we'll sell it.

310
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:58.556
- I still think
there's something special

311
00:25:58.558 --> 00:26:00.124
about that lamp.

312
00:26:05.932 --> 00:26:07.097
- Oh! Oh!

313
00:26:14.907 --> 00:26:18.108
- I am the Genie of the Lamp!

314
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:20.611
Thou hast summoned me.

315
00:26:23.516 --> 00:26:25.616
Why doest thou hide. O Master?

316
00:26:26.686 --> 00:26:30.554
Rise so I may serve thee.

317
00:26:31.691 --> 00:26:34.558
- Forgive me.
I didn't summon thee.

318
00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:35.826
Uh...

319
00:26:35.828 --> 00:26:38.495
- Thou didst summon me
from the lamp.

320
00:26:38.497 --> 00:26:41.231
- I told you it was special.

321
00:26:41.233 --> 00:26:43.667
- So that's why the Vizier
wanted the lamp.

322
00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:45.536
- That coward!

323
00:26:45.538 --> 00:26:47.004
He sent you to brave the traps

324
00:26:47.006 --> 00:26:49.239
that he should
have braved himself!

325
00:26:50.242 --> 00:26:51.875
He is so unworthy.

326
00:26:52.945 --> 00:26:55.846
- Does that make me worthy?

327
00:26:55.848 --> 00:26:59.216
- Worthy of being
the Vizier's lamp lackey.

328
00:26:59.218 --> 00:27:00.784
- Yes.

329
00:27:00.786 --> 00:27:03.087
You've done well to tell me
these things. mortal.

330
00:27:04.357 --> 00:27:05.723
- Mortal?

331
00:27:05.725 --> 00:27:07.257
[chuckles]

332
00:27:07.259 --> 00:27:09.026
You're real?

333
00:27:09.028 --> 00:27:10.060
A genie?

334
00:27:10.062 --> 00:27:12.363
Magic is real.

335
00:27:12.365 --> 00:27:16.700
- I appeared out of a lamp
in a puff of smoke.

336
00:27:16.702 --> 00:27:18.936
Was that nothing to you?

337
00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.374
- Actually. it was
when the Vizier

338
00:27:23.376 --> 00:27:24.808
opened up the magic cave.

339
00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:27.311
- The Vizier consorts
with the Dark Ones.

340
00:27:27.313 --> 00:27:31.248
You must avoid him at all cost.

341
00:27:33.986 --> 00:27:36.086
- That will be difficult.

342
00:27:36.088 --> 00:27:39.757
You see. he stands
between me and a...

343
00:27:40.593 --> 00:27:42.126
a woman I've met.

344
00:27:42.128 --> 00:27:46.330
- Ah. now that is
more to my liking.

345
00:27:47.833 --> 00:27:50.234
Romance is my specialty.

346
00:27:50.236 --> 00:27:54.371
So who is this... woman?

347
00:27:54.373 --> 00:27:56.073
- A woman out of his league.

348
00:27:58.744 --> 00:28:00.778
- I woman I dare not romance.

349
00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:03.580
- Romance? That's what
started the entire mess!

350
00:28:03.582 --> 00:28:04.948
Imagined romance!

351
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:07.151
- Oh. friends of my master.

352
00:28:07.153 --> 00:28:09.386
do you doubt
my master's affections?

353
00:28:09.388 --> 00:28:12.022
- Did he just call you
his master again?

354
00:28:12.858 --> 00:28:16.694
- He who summons me rules me.

355
00:28:16.696 --> 00:28:17.828
[chuckles]

356
00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:20.197
- I have a genie.

357
00:28:20.199 --> 00:28:23.400
Oh. wait.
How does this work?

358
00:28:23.402 --> 00:28:25.235
- What do you desire?

359
00:28:27.006 --> 00:28:31.241
- If I were to be honest.
at this moment. a hot meal.

360
00:28:31.243 --> 00:28:32.743
- A feast!

361
00:28:32.745 --> 00:28:34.111
For you and your friends?

362
00:28:36.749 --> 00:28:38.348
- Why not?

363
00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:41.285
Try not to over-season
the mutton. if you would.

364
00:28:42.488 --> 00:28:43.687
- Hmm.

365
00:28:45.825 --> 00:28:47.658
- By Allah!

366
00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:49.059
I was jesting!

367
00:28:49.061 --> 00:28:51.795
- Well. your stomach
said otherwise. master.

368
00:28:51.797 --> 00:28:53.797
- Sorcery!

369
00:28:53.799 --> 00:28:56.567
- Genie. Now sit.
Enjoy.

370
00:28:56.569 --> 00:28:58.335
Come on. come on. come on.

371
00:29:03.008 --> 00:29:05.809
- ¶ It wasn't the stars
in your eyes ¶

372
00:29:05.811 --> 00:29:08.579
¶ It wasn't the heavens above ¶

373
00:29:08.581 --> 00:29:11.315
¶ Your smile was
just a disguise ¶

374
00:29:11.317 --> 00:29:14.585
¶ And my purse disappeared
with your love ¶

375
00:29:14.587 --> 00:29:16.120
- ¶ Your love ¶

376
00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:19.656
- How do you know all our songs?

377
00:29:19.658 --> 00:29:20.991
- Genie.

378
00:29:23.796 --> 00:29:25.229
[belches]

379
00:29:28.834 --> 00:29:30.334
[belches]

380
00:29:30.336 --> 00:29:31.735
- Ugh!
- Hey!

381
00:29:31.737 --> 00:29:35.139
- That stench is worse
than a dead camel's backside.

382
00:29:35.141 --> 00:29:37.608
[belches]

383
00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:39.042
- Eh.

384
00:29:43.816 --> 00:29:46.416
[belches]

385
00:29:47.653 --> 00:29:50.487
- Oh. excuse me.

386
00:29:53.425 --> 00:29:55.993
- Aladdin. surely this genie
can give you

387
00:29:55.995 --> 00:29:58.796
whatever your heart desires.

388
00:29:58.798 --> 00:30:00.330
- Indeed I can. master.

389
00:30:02.802 --> 00:30:05.803
- I have all that
I could ever need.

390
00:30:05.805 --> 00:30:08.739
I have you. my good friends

391
00:30:08.741 --> 00:30:10.841
who are to me as family.

392
00:30:12.344 --> 00:30:14.378
I have my health.

393
00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:15.445
Our life is pleasant.

394
00:30:16.949 --> 00:30:18.148
I lack for nothing.

395
00:30:19.151 --> 00:30:20.450
- There's nothing missing?

396
00:30:21.587 --> 00:30:22.953
- If I'm to be honest...

397
00:30:26.091 --> 00:30:28.025
the only thing missing
would be love.

398
00:30:29.595 --> 00:30:31.028
And Shahzadi is the only piece

399
00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:32.830
that would make the puzzle
of my life complete.

400
00:30:32.832 --> 00:30:34.364
- Shahzadi?

401
00:30:35.501 --> 00:30:36.834
She can be yours!

402
00:30:37.636 --> 00:30:40.237
- Alas. I am unworthy.

403
00:30:42.241 --> 00:30:44.374
She is Sultana.

404
00:30:44.376 --> 00:30:47.211
And I am nothing
but a street performer.

405
00:30:47.213 --> 00:30:48.545
A commoner.

406
00:30:48.547 --> 00:30:50.681
- A peasant.
- Plebe.

407
00:30:50.683 --> 00:30:52.015
- A rube.
- Laborer.

408
00:30:52.017 --> 00:30:53.417
- Serf.
- Boor.

409
00:30:54.687 --> 00:30:55.986
- Ouch!

410
00:30:58.224 --> 00:31:01.425
- Well. I see what
you problem is. Aladdin.

411
00:31:01.427 --> 00:31:03.160
You two need to be equals.

412
00:31:04.496 --> 00:31:06.263
I shall make her a peasant.

413
00:31:06.265 --> 00:31:08.899
- No. no.

414
00:31:08.901 --> 00:31:11.134
I can't make that
decision for her.

415
00:31:13.172 --> 00:31:15.172
I--

416
00:31:15.174 --> 00:31:18.408
If I were a prince. well.
then she could consider me.

417
00:31:20.546 --> 00:31:22.880
- Well. I can make you a prince!

418
00:31:22.882 --> 00:31:24.214
Either way works for me.

419
00:31:24.216 --> 00:31:27.551
Mortals choose their own paths.

420
00:31:27.553 --> 00:31:29.286
I merely assist.

421
00:31:31.056 --> 00:31:32.389
- How do you get to
be a genie?

422
00:31:32.391 --> 00:31:33.690
Where do you come from?

423
00:31:33.692 --> 00:31:37.661
- We're born to it.
slaves of the mystic lamp.

424
00:31:37.663 --> 00:31:39.596
and the power therein.

425
00:31:40.733 --> 00:31:43.400
- You and the lamp are one?

426
00:31:43.402 --> 00:31:45.068
- If the lamp
were to be sundered.

427
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:47.571
I would be my own man.

428
00:31:47.573 --> 00:31:49.907
But as long as it remains whole.

429
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:51.108
I'm forever bound to it.

430
00:31:53.078 --> 00:31:55.078
- So you have no parents?

431
00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:56.980
No sisters? Brothers?

432
00:31:56.982 --> 00:31:59.149
- I am as you see me.

433
00:32:01.587 --> 00:32:03.453
- What's your name?

434
00:32:03.455 --> 00:32:05.289
- My name?

435
00:32:06.358 --> 00:32:07.758
Oh.

436
00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:11.261
In 10.000 years and
endless masters.

437
00:32:11.263 --> 00:32:13.463
no one has ever asked
me that before.

438
00:32:15.401 --> 00:32:17.367
- I like knowing
the names of my friends.

439
00:32:17.369 --> 00:32:20.304
- Nor has anyone
called me that either!

440
00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.206
- Then it's time
we changed that.

441
00:32:24.476 --> 00:32:25.876
I am Aladdin.

442
00:32:28.547 --> 00:32:29.947
- Aladdin.

443
00:32:29.949 --> 00:32:32.282
Well. my name is
far too long

444
00:32:32.284 --> 00:32:34.151
and too difficult
for you to say.

445
00:32:34.153 --> 00:32:36.420
So you may call me Friend.

446
00:32:36.422 --> 00:32:40.490
though I am partial
to the name Murat.

447
00:32:40.492 --> 00:32:41.491
- Wish come true.

448
00:32:42.828 --> 00:32:44.027
- Exactly.

449
00:32:44.964 --> 00:32:47.698
Now back to matters at hand.

450
00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.000
If a prince you wish to be.

451
00:32:50.002 --> 00:32:53.236
then appropriate
raiment is in order.

452
00:32:53.238 --> 00:32:55.806
Stand up!
Up. up. up. up.

453
00:32:55.808 --> 00:32:57.007
Come on. quickly. quickly.

454
00:32:58.677 --> 00:33:00.043
Hmm.

455
00:33:06.752 --> 00:33:09.019
It might look a little out
of date fashion-wise

456
00:33:09.021 --> 00:33:12.522
'cause it has been a minute
since I've seen what's current.

457
00:33:14.193 --> 00:33:17.227
- Your clothes!
You look like a prince!

458
00:33:17.229 --> 00:33:18.328
- See?

459
00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:20.664
I told you my fashion sense
was good.

460
00:33:20.666 --> 00:33:25.535
- I think the Sultana will still
recognize acrobat Aladdin.

461
00:33:25.537 --> 00:33:27.771
[Genie scoffs]

462
00:33:27.773 --> 00:33:29.106
- Easily rectified!

463
00:33:33.012 --> 00:33:35.512
- Impressive.

464
00:33:35.514 --> 00:33:37.814
Allah himself
would not recognize him.

465
00:33:37.816 --> 00:33:40.283
- Allah sees past the wrapping
to the gift within.

466
00:33:40.285 --> 00:33:43.887
- The wrapping has
more value than the gift.

467
00:33:43.889 --> 00:33:45.555
- What are you all on about?

468
00:33:55.934 --> 00:33:58.201
- You're still the same. Master.

469
00:33:58.203 --> 00:34:01.071
except everyone else
sees a different you.

470
00:34:02.508 --> 00:34:05.876
- I'm not sure I want
to be a "different you".

471
00:34:05.878 --> 00:34:08.512
- It's just what's inside
you that never changes.

472
00:34:08.514 --> 00:34:12.115
She will love the real you.
rest assured.

473
00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:16.453
There's still something missing.

474
00:34:17.756 --> 00:34:19.990
Ah. stand back!

475
00:34:19.992 --> 00:34:23.894
This will be
the end-all. be-all!

476
00:34:23.896 --> 00:34:26.063
- What does that even mean?

477
00:34:26.065 --> 00:34:28.131
[laughs]

478
00:34:48.821 --> 00:34:50.754
- Ya salaam.

479
00:34:50.756 --> 00:34:52.756
- You took the words
right out of my mouth. brother.

480
00:34:56.728 --> 00:35:00.430
- Well. my Master.
I believe this meets

481
00:35:00.432 --> 00:35:02.899
the criteria that
you commanded.

482
00:35:02.901 --> 00:35:04.701
[chuckles]

483
00:35:06.305 --> 00:35:08.805
- I suppose it'll suffice.

484
00:35:09.842 --> 00:35:11.441
- Suffice?!

485
00:35:11.443 --> 00:35:13.944
Ha!
By the beard of the Prophet!

486
00:35:13.946 --> 00:35:17.647
[chuckles]

487
00:35:17.649 --> 00:35:19.950
- I'm sorry. Murat. I...

488
00:35:19.952 --> 00:35:22.486
I just wanted to see what you
would do if a wish went wrong.

489
00:35:22.488 --> 00:35:26.456
- Well. my wishes
never go wrong.

490
00:35:27.759 --> 00:35:30.694
Sultana certainly
can't find fault with this.

491
00:35:32.297 --> 00:35:33.964
- She'll never see it.

492
00:35:33.966 --> 00:35:35.966
She's never left Baghdad.

493
00:35:35.968 --> 00:35:40.704
- Well. guess what?
I'll bring the Sultana here.

494
00:35:40.706 --> 00:35:45.542
- No. no. no. no!
Whoo. no! No.

495
00:35:45.544 --> 00:35:46.576
No magic.

496
00:35:49.047 --> 00:35:50.347
We'll invite her.

497
00:35:51.984 --> 00:35:53.817
She should come
to me on her own.

498
00:35:54.987 --> 00:35:56.153
- Oh.

499
00:35:56.155 --> 00:35:58.722
Okay. Master.
As you command.

500
00:36:27.352 --> 00:36:31.354
- It is nice to leave
the worries of the palace behind

501
00:36:31.356 --> 00:36:33.423
even for a moment. yes?

502
00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:38.028
- They are. unfortunately.

503
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:39.729
never far behind.

504
00:36:41.667 --> 00:36:43.667
- Well. perhaps
the burdens of office

505
00:36:43.669 --> 00:36:47.304
are far too much for
one person to handle alone.

506
00:36:47.306 --> 00:36:50.774
- That is why I have you.
my Vizier.

507
00:36:53.946 --> 00:36:57.948
- Well. perhaps I could mean
more to you than just Vizier.

508
00:36:57.950 --> 00:37:00.650
Shahzadi. if only...

509
00:37:00.652 --> 00:37:03.753
- My Sultana. I bring
a message from a courier.

510
00:37:03.755 --> 00:37:05.222
- A courier?

511
00:37:05.224 --> 00:37:06.423
You may rise.

512
00:37:07.226 --> 00:37:09.059
A courier from whom?

513
00:37:09.061 --> 00:37:10.460
- I don't know. my lady.

514
00:37:10.462 --> 00:37:13.363
but he rode upon
a beautiful white horse.

515
00:37:21.306 --> 00:37:26.343
- "His Royal Highness.
Prince Ali Ababba.

516
00:37:26.345 --> 00:37:30.113
"extends his congratulations
to his royal neighbor

517
00:37:30.115 --> 00:37:35.952
and invites Her Majesty to
attend a feast in her honor."

518
00:37:35.954 --> 00:37:38.755
Who is Ali Ababba?

519
00:37:38.757 --> 00:37:43.460
- I know of no such royal family
by that name. Your Highness.

520
00:37:44.463 --> 00:37:47.230
- Nonetheless. we shall attend.

521
00:37:49.001 --> 00:37:51.001
- Ah. she's here. Master!

522
00:37:51.003 --> 00:37:53.236
She'll enter in moments.

523
00:37:58.110 --> 00:37:59.676
- I am ready to receive them.

524
00:38:05.017 --> 00:38:06.683
- Not quite.

525
00:38:06.685 --> 00:38:11.321
Your friends must not be seen
or else all will be undone.

526
00:38:11.323 --> 00:38:12.756
- Wait! What?

527
00:38:14.126 --> 00:38:15.492
- Regrets.

528
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:21.865
They have all the best food
in their rooms. Master.

529
00:38:24.036 --> 00:38:25.468
- Very well.

530
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:27.003
That was one of two concerns.

531
00:38:27.005 --> 00:38:28.571
- Correct.

532
00:38:28.573 --> 00:38:32.509
Now you. my handsome fellow.
need to make an entrance!

533
00:38:46.658 --> 00:38:49.859
- This is wealth unimagined.
Maghreb.

534
00:38:50.962 --> 00:38:52.262
- Indeed.

535
00:38:52.264 --> 00:38:55.532
How have we not known of
such wealth?

536
00:38:57.669 --> 00:39:00.303
How have I not known
of this wealth?

537
00:39:01.239 --> 00:39:02.972
- Where is our host?

538
00:39:27.199 --> 00:39:28.465
- At last.

539
00:39:29.634 --> 00:39:32.836
Delighted to meet you.

540
00:39:32.838 --> 00:39:35.572
Greetings and felicitations.
exalted guests.

541
00:39:36.808 --> 00:39:40.310
Welcome to my humble home.
Your Majesty.

542
00:39:42.214 --> 00:39:43.580
- Humble...

543
00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:47.350
- Thank you. Your Highness.

544
00:39:48.353 --> 00:39:51.721
May I introduce
my most trusted Vizier?

545
00:39:51.723 --> 00:39:54.924
Maghreb Arshad al-Badour.

546
00:39:54.926 --> 00:39:57.560
- Your invitation is most
gracious. Your Highness.

547
00:39:57.562 --> 00:40:02.766
Your. uh...
home is quite lovely.

548
00:40:04.169 --> 00:40:05.835
- Greetings to you. Maghreb.

549
00:40:07.205 --> 00:40:10.173
Please. permit me the honor
of giving you a small tour

550
00:40:10.175 --> 00:40:11.775
before we dine.

551
00:40:11.777 --> 00:40:14.677
- The honor and pleasure
would be ours. Your Highness.

552
00:40:16.948 --> 00:40:21.718
- I would be honored if you
would call me Ali. Your Majesty.

553
00:40:37.869 --> 00:40:39.836
- He treats me like
a little sister.

554
00:40:39.838 --> 00:40:41.638
- You have known each
other your whole lives.

555
00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:44.073
It's hard for him
to see you as anything else.

556
00:40:44.075 --> 00:40:46.976
- She doesn't have anything
that I don't have!

557
00:40:56.054 --> 00:40:57.387
Well. we know each other.

558
00:40:57.389 --> 00:40:59.289
I know him more
than he knows himself.

559
00:40:59.291 --> 00:41:01.691
- If you did. you would
see what's in his heart now.

560
00:41:08.834 --> 00:41:12.469
- I may steal your chef.
Prince Ali.

561
00:41:12.471 --> 00:41:16.372
The variety of dishes
you served was amazing.

562
00:41:16.374 --> 00:41:18.208
I did not know the names
of half of them.

563
00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:20.477
[chuckles]

564
00:41:20.479 --> 00:41:23.346
- Neither did I.
- Oh?

565
00:41:23.348 --> 00:41:25.548
- My. uh...

566
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:27.951
My chef is relatively
new to this region.

567
00:41:30.322 --> 00:41:31.754
- This is a pleasant diversion.

568
00:41:34.159 --> 00:41:35.792
Your garden is lovely.

569
00:41:55.614 --> 00:41:57.547
- Aha! I win again.

570
00:41:57.549 --> 00:41:59.482
- You mean. you cheated again.

571
00:42:00.285 --> 00:42:01.618
- You wound me.

572
00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:03.086
Was there ever a man
more misunderstood?

573
00:42:03.088 --> 00:42:05.421
- Oh. I understand you fine.
you wooly-headed rascal!

574
00:42:05.423 --> 00:42:06.723
This time. you've gone too far!

575
00:42:06.725 --> 00:42:09.526
- Temper!
It is but magic money!

576
00:42:09.528 --> 00:42:11.060
- It's the principle!

577
00:42:20.839 --> 00:42:22.071
[grunts]

578
00:42:22.073 --> 00:42:23.540
- It's always
the honest man that suffers!

579
00:42:26.945 --> 00:42:28.645
- The Acrobats!

580
00:42:30.015 --> 00:42:31.714
Aladdin!

581
00:42:31.716 --> 00:42:33.249
Aladdin has the lamp!

582
00:42:37.722 --> 00:42:41.291
- Your garden is truly
remarkable. Prince Ali.

583
00:42:41.293 --> 00:42:44.093
- Please. just Ali.

584
00:42:46.765 --> 00:42:49.999
- Never have I seen
such lush growth before.

585
00:42:51.369 --> 00:42:53.169
Such unusual trees.

586
00:42:54.606 --> 00:42:58.541
- My gardener called
it a forest.

587
00:43:01.479 --> 00:43:03.279
- I love gardens.

588
00:43:03.281 --> 00:43:05.848
- As do I.

589
00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:09.419
As a youth. I would
sit in the trees barefoot

590
00:43:09.421 --> 00:43:11.054
and play the flute.

591
00:43:12.591 --> 00:43:14.624
- I was never allowed
to climb a tree.

592
00:43:14.626 --> 00:43:18.127
- Mm. rules. rituals.
restriction.

593
00:43:18.129 --> 00:43:19.796
- Such is our life.

594
00:43:23.134 --> 00:43:25.635
- You should never be afraid
to break a rule

595
00:43:25.637 --> 00:43:28.204
if it means
a little happiness.

596
00:43:29.808 --> 00:43:33.710
- Happiness is hard to come by
when you rule a kingdom.

597
00:43:33.712 --> 00:43:36.512
You know this.

598
00:43:36.514 --> 00:43:40.216
- I know I yearn for a life
that is more than ruling.

599
00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:49.692
- Your home is truly beautiful.
Prince Ali.

600
00:43:49.694 --> 00:43:53.196
- Made even more so by your
presence. Your Highness.

601
00:43:53.198 --> 00:43:54.497
[chuckles]

602
00:43:54.499 --> 00:43:57.734
- Please. no flattery.

603
00:43:57.736 --> 00:43:59.936
I get my fill of that at home.

604
00:44:01.206 --> 00:44:04.974
- Every royal does.
but surely you have

605
00:44:04.976 --> 00:44:07.877
learned to tell the difference
between false and real?

606
00:44:09.648 --> 00:44:11.948
- I seem to have
missed that lesson.

607
00:44:13.284 --> 00:44:16.953
- Allow me to share the chapter
you skipped. my lady.

608
00:44:21.159 --> 00:44:25.161
Were the stars themselves
to drop from the heavens.

609
00:44:25.163 --> 00:44:30.199
they could not match
the sparkle in your eyes.

610
00:44:30.201 --> 00:44:31.701
[giggles]

611
00:44:33.204 --> 00:44:36.506
- Even the dimmest village girl
would not fall for that.

612
00:44:36.508 --> 00:44:39.108
[giggles]

613
00:44:43.148 --> 00:44:48.217
- The sound of your laughter
is like unto sweet music

614
00:44:48.219 --> 00:44:49.886
and gladdens my heart.

615
00:44:53.158 --> 00:44:54.223
- That is better.

616
00:45:03.001 --> 00:45:05.234
- Your hands are
as warm as your smile.

617
00:45:08.373 --> 00:45:10.239
- They are merely hands.

618
00:45:12.243 --> 00:45:16.279
- They tremble
as does your heart.

619
00:45:20.118 --> 00:45:23.086
- I think I've learnt
the lesson. Prince Ali.

620
00:45:26.291 --> 00:45:27.924
- You're a quick study.

621
00:45:27.926 --> 00:45:29.726
- I have a good teacher.

622
00:45:29.728 --> 00:45:30.927
[chuckles]

623
00:45:32.597 --> 00:45:34.163
- And what has
the student learned?

624
00:45:37.402 --> 00:45:38.768
- It's the eyes.

625
00:45:40.672 --> 00:45:42.638
The mouth may speak.

626
00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:45.975
but the eyes
speak the truth.

627
00:45:45.977 --> 00:45:48.878
- Then you know the truth
of the matter regarding me.

628
00:45:59.491 --> 00:46:00.923
Your Highness?

629
00:46:02.861 --> 00:46:04.026
Come join me.

630
00:46:04.028 --> 00:46:06.662
- Prince Ali. I...
I couldn't.

631
00:46:06.664 --> 00:46:08.397
- Ah-ah. Mm-mm.

632
00:46:08.399 --> 00:46:12.301
My garden. my rules.
and there are none.

633
00:46:13.938 --> 00:46:15.705
Come. I'll help you up.

634
00:46:21.179 --> 00:46:22.812
[chuckles]

635
00:46:32.624 --> 00:46:35.358
- My mother used to say.

636
00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:39.328
"Aaliya. my heart.
time for bed.

637
00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:43.499
The moon will
be back tomorrow."

638
00:46:45.336 --> 00:46:46.335
- Aaliya?

639
00:46:47.505 --> 00:46:49.105
- My middle name.

640
00:46:51.876 --> 00:46:53.976
Father named me Shahzadi

641
00:46:53.978 --> 00:46:57.046
because I was a princess
in his life.

642
00:46:57.048 --> 00:46:59.015
not just by office.

643
00:47:00.652 --> 00:47:02.518
But my mother
named me Aaliya.

644
00:47:18.403 --> 00:47:21.771
Do you have a
private name to share?

645
00:47:27.779 --> 00:47:29.312
[gasps]

646
00:47:37.088 --> 00:47:39.856
Maghreb. what are you doing?

647
00:47:39.858 --> 00:47:42.325
- Don't. no.

648
00:47:42.327 --> 00:47:46.095
- Thank you. Prince Ali.

649
00:47:46.097 --> 00:47:48.231
or should I say Aladdin?

650
00:47:50.935 --> 00:47:53.836
- The eyes!
The acrobat!

651
00:47:54.706 --> 00:47:56.038
- Yes. my dear.

652
00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:57.874
He has deceived us
all into believing

653
00:47:57.876 --> 00:47:59.809
that he was a real prince.

654
00:47:59.811 --> 00:48:02.311
- But the palace. the garden!

655
00:48:02.313 --> 00:48:03.980
- All magic!

656
00:48:03.982 --> 00:48:06.315
- Let her go. Maghreb.

657
00:48:06.317 --> 00:48:07.316
- Magic?

658
00:48:08.319 --> 00:48:09.485
- Behold.

659
00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:17.260
[gasps]

660
00:48:20.098 --> 00:48:21.998
- Thou has summoned me. Master?

661
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.133
Command me.

662
00:48:24.135 --> 00:48:27.069
- Genie. I quite
like this palace.

663
00:48:27.071 --> 00:48:30.139
Move it to yon
mountaintop here.

664
00:48:30.141 --> 00:48:32.475
I shall rule
from there as Sultan...

665
00:48:33.845 --> 00:48:35.745
with my new bride. of course.

666
00:48:35.747 --> 00:48:36.946
- No!

667
00:48:39.384 --> 00:48:40.716
[chuckles]

668
00:48:40.718 --> 00:48:44.487
- Genie. take all that
I now possess to my new home.

669
00:48:45.924 --> 00:48:47.757
Thank you. fool.

670
00:48:47.759 --> 00:48:50.359
Enjoy your return to poverty!

671
00:48:51.462 --> 00:48:53.296
- No. no...

672
00:48:54.599 --> 00:48:56.032
Shall we?

673
00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:11.113
- I knew it was
too good to last.

674
00:49:11.115 --> 00:49:12.548
- Aladdin. what happened?

675
00:49:12.550 --> 00:49:14.150
- The Vizier happened.

676
00:49:16.321 --> 00:49:18.487
And that's where we have
to go to set it right.

677
00:49:21.793 --> 00:49:23.092
- How would we get there?

678
00:49:23.094 --> 00:49:25.127
We have no horses.
no camels. no genie!

679
00:49:25.129 --> 00:49:26.629
Maghreb took everything!

680
00:49:26.631 --> 00:49:28.130
- And we will get it back.

681
00:49:28.132 --> 00:49:31.801
- How?
We have no weapons. no magic.

682
00:49:31.803 --> 00:49:32.969
- We have each other.

683
00:49:32.971 --> 00:49:34.670
- He has a genie.

684
00:49:36.174 --> 00:49:37.506
We should leave while we can.

685
00:49:37.508 --> 00:49:40.209
- He may not spare us
when we next meet.

686
00:49:41.079 --> 00:49:43.546
- Aladdin. this is a sign.

687
00:49:43.548 --> 00:49:47.083
a sign that we have no business
consorting with royalty.

688
00:49:47.085 --> 00:49:49.986
Their concerns are not ours!

689
00:49:49.988 --> 00:49:51.687
- In the heavens.
we all look the same.

690
00:49:51.689 --> 00:49:54.390
we just follow different paths.

691
00:49:54.392 --> 00:49:57.093
- So a wicked man in power
doesn't concern us?

692
00:50:01.366 --> 00:50:03.833
All of this happened
because of me.

693
00:50:03.835 --> 00:50:05.301
It's mine to undo.

694
00:50:08.673 --> 00:50:09.972
- I'm with you. Aladdin.

695
00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:13.576
- As am I.

696
00:50:16.114 --> 00:50:19.348
- When a man stretcheth
out his hand.

697
00:50:19.350 --> 00:50:21.384
his brother may not refuse.

698
00:50:24.188 --> 00:50:27.456
- Or his sister.
I'll go.

699
00:50:28.493 --> 00:50:29.525
But only because you lot

700
00:50:29.527 --> 00:50:31.460
can barely tie
your sashes without me.

701
00:50:31.462 --> 00:50:32.728
[chuckles]

702
00:50:48.513 --> 00:50:51.680
- Why. the radiance
from your cheeks

703
00:50:51.682 --> 00:50:55.785
shames even the moon
and stars into retreat.

704
00:50:55.787 --> 00:50:58.287
- What do you want. Vizier?

705
00:50:59.924 --> 00:51:02.992
- It is Sultan to you. my lamb.

706
00:51:04.062 --> 00:51:06.328
- I am not your lamb!

707
00:51:09.367 --> 00:51:11.333
- Genie.

708
00:51:11.335 --> 00:51:14.103
My betrothed
needs proper raiment.

709
00:51:15.306 --> 00:51:18.140
- As thy command. Master.

710
00:51:20.278 --> 00:51:24.180
- Ah. ever more lovely.

711
00:51:27.785 --> 00:51:29.285
Genie. you may go.

712
00:51:32.523 --> 00:51:34.924
- I will never
marry you. Vizier!

713
00:51:34.926 --> 00:51:38.127
- Hmm. Your venom stings.

714
00:51:38.129 --> 00:51:41.597
but I shall pull your
fangs soon enough.

715
00:51:41.599 --> 00:51:44.467
Now prepare yourself.
Aaliya...

716
00:51:46.304 --> 00:51:47.470
my love.

717
00:51:51.175 --> 00:51:53.676
- Never use that name!

718
00:52:15.099 --> 00:52:16.699
- That's it
unless we find more.

719
00:52:16.701 --> 00:52:19.668
- There should be more up
ahead by the mountain.

720
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:21.137
- It is so hot already!

721
00:52:21.139 --> 00:52:23.906
I don't think
we can make it that far!

722
00:52:23.908 --> 00:52:25.708
Aladdin. we're still
close enough to Baghdad.

723
00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:27.476
Let us return and
grab supplies at least.

724
00:52:27.478 --> 00:52:28.944
- No. We don't have time.

725
00:52:28.946 --> 00:52:31.046
We don't know what
Maghreb's planning.

726
00:52:31.048 --> 00:52:32.548
We must move forward.

727
00:52:32.550 --> 00:52:34.517
- To be honest. I'm not
in such a hurry to meet up

728
00:52:34.519 --> 00:52:36.552
with a wicked man
wielding a genie!

729
00:52:36.554 --> 00:52:37.553
- Samad...

730
00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:41.590
I don't know
what fate awaits us.

731
00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:45.094
Take courage. brother.

732
00:52:45.096 --> 00:52:46.362
We will make this right.

733
00:52:52.003 --> 00:52:53.969
- You would die for a lie?

734
00:52:53.971 --> 00:52:56.805
- Even the Vizier
spoke with a little wisdom.

735
00:52:56.807 --> 00:52:59.542
He said it is never sad
to embrace your destiny.

736
00:53:15.193 --> 00:53:17.793
- I don't like this.
- Nor do I. Sister.

737
00:53:17.795 --> 00:53:19.595
It wreaks of sorcery.

738
00:53:19.597 --> 00:53:20.596
- Guys?

739
00:53:20.598 --> 00:53:22.731
A little help?
- Dairush!

740
00:53:25.203 --> 00:53:26.202
- Come on. Dariush!

741
00:53:26.204 --> 00:53:27.369
- I'm slipping!

742
00:53:27.371 --> 00:53:28.571
- It's a trap!

743
00:53:29.941 --> 00:53:31.273
Hold me!

744
00:53:31.275 --> 00:53:35.044
Dariush! Grab my hand!
Grab me. grab me.

745
00:53:35.046 --> 00:53:36.545
- I can't...

746
00:53:37.548 --> 00:53:39.315
- Dariush!
- Hold on to his hand!

747
00:53:39.317 --> 00:53:40.316
- Grab my hand!

748
00:53:40.318 --> 00:53:41.617
[grunting]

749
00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:44.253
No!

750
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:59.935
- I have your lunch.
Your Highness.

751
00:54:24.729 --> 00:54:26.262
- Dariush would
have something lofty to say

752
00:54:26.264 --> 00:54:27.529
if he were here now.

753
00:54:29.834 --> 00:54:31.967
- If we weren't here.
he would be here.

754
00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:37.473
[wind blowing]

755
00:54:39.377 --> 00:54:40.442
- It's happening again.

756
00:54:40.444 --> 00:54:41.877
- We should get under cover!

757
00:54:41.879 --> 00:54:43.345
- Ah!

758
00:54:43.347 --> 00:54:45.281
- Sister!

759
00:54:45.283 --> 00:54:46.715
- Naveena!

760
00:54:50.488 --> 00:54:51.920
- Samad!

761
00:54:51.922 --> 00:54:53.589
Samad!

762
00:54:53.591 --> 00:54:55.724
- No!

763
00:54:55.726 --> 00:54:58.027
Oh--

764
00:54:58.029 --> 00:54:59.561
Oh. no!
- He's dead!

765
00:55:00.898 --> 00:55:02.364
He's dead!

766
00:55:12.043 --> 00:55:15.844
- I...
Am not... Your wife!

767
00:55:27.325 --> 00:55:32.561
- Is this truly the whole
of our world?

768
00:55:32.563 --> 00:55:34.897
- As thee commanded
to see. Master.

769
00:55:36.734 --> 00:55:41.036
- The lands beyond land.
vast oceans!

770
00:55:41.038 --> 00:55:45.341
There must be sights
and marvels to behold.

771
00:55:45.343 --> 00:55:47.409
- Oh. indeed. Master.

772
00:55:47.411 --> 00:55:50.913
Wouldst thou carest to see
a volcano up close?

773
00:55:50.915 --> 00:55:54.750
It's truly a wondrous
thing to see first-hand.

774
00:55:54.752 --> 00:55:58.220
Though only needst wish. hmm?

775
00:55:58.222 --> 00:56:01.190
- Volcano?
What is a volcano?

776
00:56:01.192 --> 00:56:03.625
- It's--
- Never mind.

777
00:56:03.627 --> 00:56:05.694
Perhaps you can tell me later.

778
00:56:05.696 --> 00:56:09.098
For now. I wish to hear
more about these distant lands

779
00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:11.233
and who dwells there

780
00:56:11.235 --> 00:56:13.369
and all the gold they possess.

781
00:56:13.371 --> 00:56:16.338
- As you wish. Master.

782
00:56:24.048 --> 00:56:25.381
- This is sorcery.

783
00:56:25.383 --> 00:56:26.749
Maghreb knows we're coming.

784
00:56:26.751 --> 00:56:28.717
- I don't think so.
He has set traps.

785
00:56:28.719 --> 00:56:30.119
But if he were watching us.

786
00:56:30.121 --> 00:56:33.021
he'd make certain
we'd all be dead.

787
00:56:33.023 --> 00:56:34.490
- He toys with us.

788
00:56:34.492 --> 00:56:35.958
We are but flies in his web.

789
00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:37.559
- It's possible.
but I have to believe

790
00:56:37.561 --> 00:56:39.895
that there's a chance
to set this right.

791
00:56:44.068 --> 00:56:45.067
We have to try.

792
00:56:46.570 --> 00:56:48.837
- We will all die trying?

793
00:56:50.174 --> 00:56:51.373
Just like Dariush?

794
00:56:54.311 --> 00:56:56.111
Just like...

795
00:56:57.715 --> 00:57:00.582
[crying]

796
00:57:00.584 --> 00:57:01.784
This is all your fault.

797
00:57:03.587 --> 00:57:05.354
If you hadn't tried
to impress a princess.

798
00:57:05.356 --> 00:57:08.891
we'd all be back in Baghdad now.
planning our next show!

799
00:57:08.893 --> 00:57:13.061
And now my brother
is dead because of you.

800
00:57:14.432 --> 00:57:16.465
- Naveena. I'm sorry.

801
00:57:16.467 --> 00:57:18.000
None of this was
supposed to happen.

802
00:57:19.236 --> 00:57:22.271
- If you're sorry.
let's go back now!

803
00:57:22.273 --> 00:57:23.672
Before it's too late!

804
00:57:23.674 --> 00:57:25.107
- We can't do that.

805
00:57:25.109 --> 00:57:26.809
We have to finish this.

806
00:57:26.811 --> 00:57:30.145
- We die to save a woman
you imagine you love?

807
00:57:32.550 --> 00:57:34.016
- He's not the only one.

808
00:57:39.824 --> 00:57:41.123
- Naveena...

809
00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:44.493
We are as family.

810
00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:50.499
Please.

811
00:57:52.803 --> 00:57:55.771
Dariush and Samad.
they were my brothers. too.

812
00:58:00.010 --> 00:58:01.743
- You're so blind!

813
00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:07.049
Dariush and Samad would follow
you to the ends of the earth!

814
00:58:07.051 --> 00:58:08.684
We all would...

815
00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:14.523
But you led us to this.
and now they're dead.

816
00:58:15.626 --> 00:58:17.025
I'm done.

817
00:58:17.027 --> 00:58:20.429
- Naveena. please.
- I will not die for her.

818
00:58:21.565 --> 00:58:23.165
You may follow your heart...

819
00:58:25.035 --> 00:58:26.768
but mine has died.

820
00:58:29.406 --> 00:58:30.873
I'm going back to Baghdad.

821
00:58:32.276 --> 00:58:34.209
Return with me and live

822
00:58:34.211 --> 00:58:36.612
or remain and be fools.

823
00:58:41.385 --> 00:58:42.284
- I'm sorry. Naveena.

824
00:58:45.756 --> 00:58:48.123
We have to finish this.

825
00:58:48.125 --> 00:58:49.725
We have to stop Maghreb.

826
00:59:21.892 --> 00:59:24.192
- How many guards patrolling?

827
00:59:24.194 --> 00:59:26.528
- When I wished for a palace.
did I wish for this many guards?

828
00:59:26.530 --> 00:59:28.964
- I can safely say that's the
work of the Vizier. I believe.

829
00:59:28.966 --> 00:59:31.567
- But that window looks
particularly inviting.

830
00:59:31.569 --> 00:59:33.635
- A man standing
on another man's shoulders

831
00:59:33.637 --> 00:59:35.504
should be able
to make it without effort.

832
00:59:35.506 --> 00:59:36.939
- Let's see if that's true.

833
01:00:37.301 --> 01:00:39.601
- Where's Maghreb
keeping the Sultana?

834
01:00:43.974 --> 01:00:46.441
This can be hard
or easy. my friend.

835
01:00:46.443 --> 01:00:50.345
I'm gonna release this gag
and you will give us answers.

836
01:00:54.184 --> 01:00:55.217
If you yell...

837
01:00:57.054 --> 01:00:59.121
we won't
be so gentle this time.

838
01:01:01.358 --> 01:01:03.492
Where's the Sultana being held?

839
01:01:03.494 --> 01:01:05.127
And what is the feast for?

840
01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:08.397
- You're the acrobats.

841
01:01:08.399 --> 01:01:09.831
- Yes.

842
01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:11.600
We're here to save the Sultana.

843
01:01:15.105 --> 01:01:16.772
- She's on the second floor.

844
01:01:18.142 --> 01:01:20.108
She is to be married
to the Sultan tomorrow.

845
01:01:22.046 --> 01:01:23.045
- The Sultan?

846
01:01:24.248 --> 01:01:26.882
- Maghreb.
He's made himself Sultan.

847
01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:29.051
We have to hurry.

848
01:01:33.724 --> 01:01:34.990
And forgive me.

849
01:01:42.433 --> 01:01:43.899
Give me that.

850
01:01:44.768 --> 01:01:46.268
You know nothing of fighting.

851
01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:47.836
- I'm learning.

852
01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:18.300
- Shahzadi!
- Aladdin!

853
01:02:18.302 --> 01:02:19.801
You came back!

854
01:02:19.803 --> 01:02:22.104
I am so glad to see you!

855
01:02:22.106 --> 01:02:23.004
- You are?

856
01:02:23.006 --> 01:02:26.208
- Wait! No! I'm not.

857
01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:27.209
You lied to me!

858
01:02:27.211 --> 01:02:29.911
- I can explain.
but now is not the time.

859
01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:31.646
- You took the words
out of my mouth.

860
01:02:31.648 --> 01:02:33.281
We should leave quickly.

861
01:02:36.453 --> 01:02:37.619
- Well. that explains that.

862
01:02:37.621 --> 01:02:39.554
- I need no rescuer.

863
01:02:39.556 --> 01:02:41.423
but I'm pleased that
you've made the effort.

864
01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:44.426
- I could not do nothing.

865
01:02:46.497 --> 01:02:48.830
This is all my fault
and I have to set it right.

866
01:02:48.832 --> 01:02:51.933
- Your new honesty
is refreshing. Acrobat.

867
01:02:51.935 --> 01:02:54.436
I look forward to
hearing your tale.

868
01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.306
- It's not quite over yet.

869
01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:13.054
- Well. that took you
long enough.

870
01:03:14.892 --> 01:03:17.692
Trouble with the sand traps?

871
01:03:17.694 --> 01:03:19.828
[chuckles]

872
01:03:21.331 --> 01:03:23.732
Shahzadi. my flower.

873
01:03:23.734 --> 01:03:26.701
consorting with
the rabble again?

874
01:03:26.703 --> 01:03:28.603
You know. even in
slaves' garb.

875
01:03:28.605 --> 01:03:31.740
you're still the most beautiful
flower in the garden.

876
01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:34.276
However...

877
01:03:36.046 --> 01:03:37.179
Genie?

878
01:03:41.885 --> 01:03:43.852
Much better.

879
01:03:43.854 --> 01:03:45.887
Now come.

880
01:03:45.889 --> 01:03:48.390
Come sit next to me.
my Sultana.

881
01:03:49.726 --> 01:03:53.195
- I am not your Sultana!

882
01:03:53.197 --> 01:03:55.430
- Hmm.

883
01:03:55.432 --> 01:03:56.431
Genie?

884
01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:09.945
These cherries are delicious.

885
01:04:12.082 --> 01:04:14.850
Your fall from grace

886
01:04:14.852 --> 01:04:16.184
is also delicious.

887
01:04:16.186 --> 01:04:18.954
- Your taste is questionable.
Vizier.

888
01:04:20.691 --> 01:04:21.723
- Sultan.

889
01:04:21.725 --> 01:04:23.558
- In name only.

890
01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:26.695
Without the genie.
you're just a little man

891
01:04:26.697 --> 01:04:28.230
with a little lizard.

892
01:04:29.733 --> 01:04:31.900
- Hmm. Indeed.

893
01:04:31.902 --> 01:04:33.902
We shall rectify
that scenario.

894
01:04:36.106 --> 01:04:38.306
Genie. see to it that
my beloved Tanin

895
01:04:38.308 --> 01:04:41.276
is a formidable adversary
for the Acrobat.

896
01:04:43.247 --> 01:04:46.248
Oh. and be sure
that he breaths fire.

897
01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:49.885
That should make things
more interesting.

898
01:04:49.887 --> 01:04:52.520
- As thou commands. Master.

899
01:04:57.361 --> 01:04:58.827
[roaring]

900
01:05:00.964 --> 01:05:02.264
[gasps]

901
01:05:05.836 --> 01:05:07.168
- What were you thinking?

902
01:05:07.170 --> 01:05:09.104
- I thought
he'd fight me himself!

903
01:05:09.106 --> 01:05:11.473
- If we live through this.
I will<i> kill</i> you myself!

904
01:05:20.384 --> 01:05:21.783
- Aladdin!

905
01:05:21.785 --> 01:05:24.319
- You've never understood
the office which you held.

906
01:05:24.321 --> 01:05:25.987
The people don't want a friend.

907
01:05:25.989 --> 01:05:27.856
They want a ruler.

908
01:05:38.702 --> 01:05:42.404
- Here. you overgrown tadpole!

909
01:05:45.609 --> 01:05:47.142
[roaring]

910
01:05:51.949 --> 01:05:55.116
- A Sultan leads and
punishes as needed.

911
01:05:55.118 --> 01:05:57.352
Only a man can
know these things.

912
01:05:57.354 --> 01:06:02.157
- A real man doesn't need
a genie to accomplish them!

913
01:06:02.159 --> 01:06:05.527
- Perhaps. but it helps.

914
01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:16.671
- Over here. you great
big ugly belching beast!

915
01:06:16.673 --> 01:06:18.940
[roaring]

916
01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:31.553
[grunts]

917
01:06:58.415 --> 01:07:00.215
- Zamir!

918
01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:07.856
[screams]

919
01:07:07.858 --> 01:07:09.391
Zamir!

920
01:07:13.797 --> 01:07:15.230
Zamir!

921
01:07:22.139 --> 01:07:24.939
- Bravery is
no substitute for skill.

922
01:07:24.941 --> 01:07:28.610
- A thousand lashes wouldn't
be enough for you!

923
01:07:29.613 --> 01:07:32.080
[chuckles]

924
01:07:42.692 --> 01:07:45.060
- Flee. you fool.

925
01:07:45.062 --> 01:07:47.629
- Yes. Flee. you fool.

926
01:07:47.631 --> 01:07:50.465
Run back to the squalor
from which you rose...

927
01:07:52.669 --> 01:07:54.102
...and I will let you live.

928
01:08:05.115 --> 01:08:06.648
[sighs]

929
01:08:21.164 --> 01:08:23.531
He never gives up that easily.

930
01:08:25.268 --> 01:08:27.302
He's up to something.

931
01:08:28.405 --> 01:08:30.472
Guards. find him and kill him.

932
01:08:30.474 --> 01:08:33.541
- You are a serpent
made of lies!

933
01:08:34.344 --> 01:08:37.045
- But never with you. my sweet.

934
01:08:37.047 --> 01:08:39.047
[snarling]

935
01:08:39.049 --> 01:08:43.151
Be at ease.
This will all be over soon.

936
01:08:43.153 --> 01:08:44.886
[spits]

937
01:08:44.888 --> 01:08:46.821
Such spirit.

938
01:08:46.823 --> 01:08:49.057
We will make a perfect match
once your soul

939
01:08:49.059 --> 01:08:51.392
has blended with the Dark Ones.

940
01:08:53.130 --> 01:08:56.297
Genie. fetch me my
conjuring bowl and tools.

941
01:08:56.299 --> 01:08:59.000
We have a ceremony to perform.

942
01:08:59.002 --> 01:09:01.503
- Thy wish is
my command. Master.

943
01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:13.014
- I revealed a glimpse
of the Dark Arts

944
01:09:13.016 --> 01:09:15.350
to that dunce Aladdin.

945
01:09:17.354 --> 01:09:19.420
He understood nothing.

946
01:09:20.257 --> 01:09:22.624
- Foolish mortal.

947
01:09:22.626 --> 01:09:26.361
- Yes. Yes. he is.

948
01:09:28.331 --> 01:09:30.198
You meant Aladdin. yes?

949
01:09:31.034 --> 01:09:32.667
- But. of course. Master.

950
01:09:36.406 --> 01:09:38.706
- I call to thee
Oh. Dark Ones.

951
01:09:46.483 --> 01:09:49.484
I give you my own
life blood.

952
01:09:52.656 --> 01:09:53.821
My devotion.

953
01:09:57.327 --> 01:10:01.629
I have offered them
your mind and your soul.

954
01:10:02.632 --> 01:10:04.232
The rest of you.

955
01:10:04.234 --> 01:10:06.601
well. that shall
be my reward.

956
01:10:06.603 --> 01:10:09.871
- You'll never live
to collect it. you swine!

957
01:10:09.873 --> 01:10:14.108
- There's the defiant spirit
I love so much.

958
01:10:14.110 --> 01:10:17.712
We'll be a perfect match
once it's aligned with mine.

959
01:10:17.714 --> 01:10:23.251
- What matter of man needs magic
to push his will on another?

960
01:10:23.253 --> 01:10:25.787
- You gave your heart
to a peasant!

961
01:10:25.789 --> 01:10:29.891
A charm. the likes of which
you never gave to me!

962
01:10:29.893 --> 01:10:31.826
- Is that where this all began?

963
01:10:33.063 --> 01:10:35.597
Sad fool...

964
01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:41.636
My heart was
never yours to claim!

965
01:10:41.638 --> 01:10:46.074
- That sharp tongue shall
be first thing I silence!

966
01:10:46.076 --> 01:10:50.645
- Oh! Oh!

967
01:11:00.957 --> 01:11:05.994
- The Dark Ones bless me
with their countenance.

968
01:11:05.996 --> 01:11:07.662
I am their living vessel.

969
01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:14.369
- Well. if thou has such power.
what need has thou for me?

970
01:11:16.473 --> 01:11:18.673
- The price they exact
is a high one.

971
01:11:18.675 --> 01:11:21.609
My years shall fade
much like the leaves

972
01:11:21.611 --> 01:11:25.513
that drift from
a tree in the fall.

973
01:11:25.515 --> 01:11:29.183
You shall act as my conduit
from this day forth

974
01:11:29.185 --> 01:11:31.085
to carry out my will

975
01:11:31.087 --> 01:11:35.223
so that I may live
my years of leisure with her.

976
01:11:40.764 --> 01:11:43.431
It shall be
my last act of magic.

977
01:11:45.201 --> 01:11:48.303
The Dark Ones call
to you. Shahzadi!

978
01:11:48.305 --> 01:11:50.672
[screams]

979
01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:11.793
- Stop it. you fool! It's me!

980
01:12:11.795 --> 01:12:14.796
Maghreb is protected!
Destroy the bowl!

981
01:12:14.798 --> 01:12:15.997
Save Shahzadi!

982
01:12:27.344 --> 01:12:28.976
- No!

983
01:12:43.193 --> 01:12:45.393
You think you've won?

984
01:12:47.263 --> 01:12:49.397
You worthless dog.

985
01:12:49.399 --> 01:12:51.232
Come claim your reward.

986
01:12:51.234 --> 01:12:53.234
Tanin!

987
01:12:53.236 --> 01:12:55.570
[roars]

988
01:12:57.407 --> 01:12:59.307
- The dragon's weak spot
is his eyes.

989
01:12:59.309 --> 01:13:01.042
Go for the eyes!

990
01:13:06.816 --> 01:13:12.987
- I confess I am most
impressed. Acrobat.

991
01:13:14.224 --> 01:13:17.258
Few men have had
a day such as yours

992
01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:18.860
and lived to tell the tale.

993
01:13:21.331 --> 01:13:25.767
Why. you wooed a Sultana
and won her heart.

994
01:13:25.769 --> 01:13:29.070
You braved the Cave of Death.

995
01:13:29.072 --> 01:13:31.472
Did I mention that's
the real name of that cave?

996
01:13:31.474 --> 01:13:33.441
[chuckles]

997
01:13:33.443 --> 01:13:35.777
You had a genie. a palace

998
01:13:35.779 --> 01:13:39.580
and true love all
in the span of a day.

999
01:13:39.582 --> 01:13:41.849
You fought a dragon.
and lived.

1000
01:13:43.353 --> 01:13:44.819
All for her.

1001
01:13:47.891 --> 01:13:48.956
Was it worth it?

1002
01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:52.527
Perhaps we should
ask your friends.

1003
01:13:53.730 --> 01:13:57.365
You had friends with you
when you came in. right?

1004
01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:02.069
Loyal friends. I recall now.

1005
01:14:02.071 --> 01:14:06.974
Loyal to the end.
I believe the phrase goes.

1006
01:14:06.976 --> 01:14:12.046
But they all met their end
helping you find true love.

1007
01:14:13.850 --> 01:14:15.616
[chuckles]

1008
01:14:15.618 --> 01:14:19.720
I just realized that
you're exactly like me.

1009
01:14:22.025 --> 01:14:23.925
Why. you discard and
destroy anything

1010
01:14:23.927 --> 01:14:26.861
and anyone who gets in
the way of what you want.

1011
01:14:26.863 --> 01:14:28.362
[laughs]

1012
01:14:28.364 --> 01:14:29.997
Why. you could be my son!

1013
01:14:33.670 --> 01:14:35.603
Hmm. there's one
of your friends.

1014
01:14:38.308 --> 01:14:40.208
I think I shall hear
his screams

1015
01:14:40.210 --> 01:14:42.009
in my dreams tonight.

1016
01:14:44.314 --> 01:14:45.580
I know that you will.

1017
01:14:45.582 --> 01:14:47.248
[chuckles]

1018
01:14:47.250 --> 01:14:48.449
[shouts]

1019
01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:52.119
Took you long enough.

1020
01:14:57.093 --> 01:14:58.860
He's all yours. my pet.

1021
01:15:02.565 --> 01:15:03.798
- We go together. Vizier!

1022
01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:12.206
- You've learned nothing. dolt!

1023
01:15:14.744 --> 01:15:16.344
Now die!

1024
01:15:16.346 --> 01:15:17.912
Let me live me in peace.

1025
01:15:19.082 --> 01:15:20.081
Tanin!

1026
01:15:25.855 --> 01:15:28.923
Clearly a mistake.
hiring an acrobat.

1027
01:15:32.228 --> 01:15:34.829
[roars]

1028
01:15:34.831 --> 01:15:37.732
- Inshallah. guide my hand.

1029
01:15:45.441 --> 01:15:46.974
- Tanin!

1030
01:15:56.619 --> 01:16:01.088
Shahzadi gave you a powerful
charm that day. Acrobat.

1031
01:16:10.934 --> 01:16:11.933
No!

1032
01:16:18.408 --> 01:16:20.107
Genie?

1033
01:16:20.109 --> 01:16:21.576
Kill him.

1034
01:16:21.578 --> 01:16:23.644
- Yes. Master.

1035
01:16:31.754 --> 01:16:33.120
- What is happening?

1036
01:16:33.122 --> 01:16:34.922
Why does he still live?

1037
01:16:34.924 --> 01:16:37.692
- I too am mystified.
O Master.

1038
01:16:37.694 --> 01:16:40.928
- No charm is that powerful.

1039
01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:44.065
- Yes. and he's also
an agile acrobat!

1040
01:16:51.307 --> 01:16:53.474
Truly his skill
is unparalleled!

1041
01:16:53.476 --> 01:16:55.309
- I am your master.

1042
01:16:55.311 --> 01:16:57.011
You must obey me!

1043
01:16:57.013 --> 01:17:00.147
- Thy every wish is as
a command to me.

1044
01:17:00.149 --> 01:17:02.149
- Now slay this man.

1045
01:17:02.151 --> 01:17:04.151
- Yes. Master.

1046
01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:12.693
It seems he enjoys favor
from above. O Master.

1047
01:17:12.695 --> 01:17:16.097
- Enough!
I am the holder of the lamp!

1048
01:17:16.099 --> 01:17:17.798
- I see no lamp.

1049
01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:20.701
He who holds
the lamp commands me.

1050
01:17:23.206 --> 01:17:25.840
- Here now be the lamp
that commands you.

1051
01:17:25.842 --> 01:17:30.811
- Ah. yes. the lamp
that binds me with its power.

1052
01:17:30.813 --> 01:17:33.414
never to be sundered.

1053
01:17:33.416 --> 01:17:36.017
- Now remove him
from my sight!

1054
01:17:36.019 --> 01:17:37.752
- Yes. Master.

1055
01:17:43.426 --> 01:17:44.859
- At last.

1056
01:17:44.861 --> 01:17:48.696
Never has there been
a bigger thorn in my side.

1057
01:17:49.799 --> 01:17:52.933
You and I have much
to discuss. Genie.

1058
01:17:52.935 --> 01:17:56.370
There is no place for friendship
in the realm of rule.

1059
01:17:58.074 --> 01:18:00.307
- ALADDIN: Friendship
is the greatest treasure

1060
01:18:00.309 --> 01:18:02.677
of all. you demon.

1061
01:18:02.679 --> 01:18:04.211
- You still live?

1062
01:18:04.213 --> 01:18:07.882
Treacherous slave. kill him
and be done with it!

1063
01:18:07.884 --> 01:18:11.619
- No lamp. no Master.

1064
01:18:13.156 --> 01:18:15.056
- Fine.

1065
01:18:18.327 --> 01:18:19.794
[shouts]

1066
01:18:22.432 --> 01:18:23.631
Finally.

1067
01:18:30.306 --> 01:18:31.706
You speak of friendship?

1068
01:18:33.042 --> 01:18:36.110
That knife sure looks like
it could use a companion.

1069
01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:46.721
I hope there's enough life
left in you to see

1070
01:18:46.723 --> 01:18:49.423
what I do to your last friend.

1071
01:18:53.963 --> 01:18:56.664
What do you imagine you're
going to do with that?

1072
01:18:56.666 --> 01:18:58.365
- This!

1073
01:19:13.149 --> 01:19:14.682
You came back.

1074
01:19:14.684 --> 01:19:17.218
- I told you that you couldn't
tie your sashes without me.

1075
01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:18.385
[laughs]

1076
01:19:18.387 --> 01:19:19.987
- Genie. come forth!

1077
01:19:25.595 --> 01:19:29.130
The Dark Ones
still favor me. peasant!

1078
01:19:36.239 --> 01:19:37.404
- Ah!

1079
01:19:54.690 --> 01:19:59.026
- Even to the end.
you avoid your fate.

1080
01:19:59.028 --> 01:20:01.862
- Dodging things is what I do.

1081
01:20:01.864 --> 01:20:03.831
- That's all you've
ever been good at.

1082
01:20:04.634 --> 01:20:06.567
[grunts]

1083
01:20:06.569 --> 01:20:08.435
That is for my pet!

1084
01:20:10.206 --> 01:20:11.939
That's for stealing the lamp!

1085
01:20:13.309 --> 01:20:16.076
And that is for
stealing her heart!

1086
01:20:17.914 --> 01:20:22.082
- Will there be one for
being a better man than you?

1087
01:20:25.988 --> 01:20:29.056
- A fitting end
to the would-be prince.

1088
01:20:30.459 --> 01:20:34.195
- As you said. we must
all embrace our destiny.

1089
01:20:35.398 --> 01:20:38.365
- No Genie. no friends.

1090
01:20:38.367 --> 01:20:41.035
no charm. so no magic!

1091
01:20:42.672 --> 01:20:44.271
Die. Acrobat!

1092
01:21:08.564 --> 01:21:11.265
- He's waking.
- He sounds confused.

1093
01:21:11.267 --> 01:21:12.867
[laughs]

1094
01:21:12.869 --> 01:21:15.336
- If he thinks I'm an angel.
then he's definitely confused.

1095
01:21:15.338 --> 01:21:16.337
[chuckles]

1096
01:21:18.908 --> 01:21:20.908
- Not yet. my heart.

1097
01:21:22.345 --> 01:21:24.845
You've been unconscious
for many days now.

1098
01:21:26.582 --> 01:21:28.315
- Maghreb?

1099
01:21:28.317 --> 01:21:29.350
Where are we?

1100
01:21:29.352 --> 01:21:31.719
- We're safe.
We're home.

1101
01:21:31.721 --> 01:21:33.020
You're in bed.

1102
01:21:34.490 --> 01:21:36.523
- Maghreb is no more.

1103
01:21:36.525 --> 01:21:38.259
You killed him.

1104
01:21:38.261 --> 01:21:39.593
- No.

1105
01:21:39.595 --> 01:21:42.162
A great wind came and
carried him off the cliff.

1106
01:21:43.699 --> 01:21:45.432
- Not a great wind.

1107
01:21:46.969 --> 01:21:48.802
He had a little push.

1108
01:21:48.804 --> 01:21:50.170
[chuckles]

1109
01:21:50.172 --> 01:21:51.972
I couldn't let
that two-bit sorcerer

1110
01:21:51.974 --> 01:21:53.974
kill the best friend
I ever had.

1111
01:21:53.976 --> 01:21:56.377
[laughs]

1112
01:21:56.379 --> 01:21:58.112
- Thank you. Murat.

1113
01:21:58.915 --> 01:22:00.447
My friend.

1114
01:22:00.449 --> 01:22:03.517
But what of you now?
Where will you go?

1115
01:22:03.519 --> 01:22:05.085
I destroyed the lamp.

1116
01:22:05.087 --> 01:22:08.722
- Wherever I will.
former Master.

1117
01:22:08.724 --> 01:22:11.292
I am no longer bound
to the lamp.

1118
01:22:16.632 --> 01:22:18.933
- I am pleased.

1119
01:22:18.935 --> 01:22:20.868
You have earned your freedom.

1120
01:22:24.273 --> 01:22:26.807
I guess I should be
on my way as well.

1121
01:22:26.809 --> 01:22:29.143
- On your way?

1122
01:22:29.145 --> 01:22:30.144
- Home.

1123
01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:33.514
I do not wish to cause you
any further trouble.

1124
01:22:35.651 --> 01:22:36.984
- You are home.

1125
01:22:39.488 --> 01:22:41.322
For now and forever.

1126
01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:45.492
I found this.

1127
01:22:48.664 --> 01:22:51.498
You cause me no trouble.

1128
01:22:53.569 --> 01:22:55.002
Not now. anyway.

1129
01:22:57.306 --> 01:22:58.372
- But...

1130
01:22:59.208 --> 01:23:00.641
I'm not what you think.

1131
01:23:01.844 --> 01:23:03.177
I am not a prince.

1132
01:23:04.347 --> 01:23:05.346
I lied to you.

1133
01:23:06.749 --> 01:23:08.248
- You are a prince...

1134
01:23:09.652 --> 01:23:11.085
in here.

1135
01:23:12.989 --> 01:23:15.222
All my life. I've had
every comfort

1136
01:23:15.224 --> 01:23:17.524
I could ever want or buy

1137
01:23:17.526 --> 01:23:21.395
except for the love
of a worthy man.

1138
01:23:21.397 --> 01:23:24.465
You are a worthy man. Aladdin.

1139
01:23:25.634 --> 01:23:27.001
And. as Sultana.

1140
01:23:27.003 --> 01:23:31.038
I make the law and can
marry whomever I choose.

1141
01:23:33.009 --> 01:23:37.077
I choose you.
if you'll have me.

1142
01:23:39.081 --> 01:23:41.048
- I suppose.

1143
01:23:41.050 --> 01:23:44.351
I have no right to refuse
a Sultana anything.

1144
01:23:44.353 --> 01:23:48.288
- Aladdin. what was the last
thing you said to Maghreb?

1145
01:23:50.893 --> 01:23:52.559
- We must all embrace
our destiny.

1146
01:23:55.031 --> 01:23:58.032
- All right. everyone.
stand back! Stand back!

1147
01:23:58.034 --> 01:24:01.402
Because I've got
a wedding to plan!

1148
01:24:01.404 --> 01:24:05.072
[laughs]

1149
01:24:25.828 --> 01:24:27.895
[soft music plays]

1150
01:26:17.106 --> 01:26:19.173
[music continues]

1151
01:27:32.348 --> 01:27:33.413
[music fades]
