MORGAN: The most important
asset that you have
as a grocer is your name.

171
00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:49.320
Because with your name
comes all the trust
and the respect.

172
00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.320
So. it's natural that
when you make your whiskey.

173
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.240
you are going to call it
"John Walker's whiskey."

174
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.200
Brands existed
because we industrialized.

175
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.480
We moved from the countryside
into cities.

176
00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.120
So. if you were buying something
from your neighbor.

177
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.080
if it was wrong.
you'd go over and.

178
00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.240
"Oi! You've just sold me
something that is no good."

179
00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.560
Whereas. once
you moved to a city.

180
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.480
you weren't necessarily
buying from around you.

181
00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:18.200
So brands emerged as a way
of providing you
with the things you needed.

182
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.440
but at their core. their trust.

is this sense of opportunity

The interesting thing.
if you look at how these
markets seem to grow.

207
00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.360
is that it follows
the discovery
of mineral wealth.

that is gold.

all over the world.

that many expat Scots

is a liking of whiskey.

the first global brand.

214
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:38.920
even before Coca-Cola
was on the shores
of multiple countries.

215
00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:43.160
and the way they've done that
is basically bartering and bargaining with the ships.

these ships. you know.

John Walker
is our founding father.

256
00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:48.840
He set up the business.
He started making his whiskies.

257
00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:50.680
It's John's name on the bottle.

and then the generation
that came after.

we wouldn't have the business.

260
00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.800

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:01.280
in making what was
quite a small grocery shop

that he did

264

was have this label at a funny angle on the bottle.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:16.280
And it very simply said.
"John Walker & Sons
Old Highland Whiskey."

Around the same time. he introduced a square bottle.

No one had done it in the past.
so they made the rules
as they went on.

The Johnnie Walker bottle
has by and large stayed the same

274
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.680
for most of its history.
And so what that means is.

275
00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.360
Johnnie Walker itself
has this Zelig-like quality.

276
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.000
which is to say that it could
appear at different moments
in time and culture.

Yeah.

to deal with that.

532
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.720

came into an America

spending money
on the good things in life.

Johnnie Walker drops an ad
which doesn't take a stand

540
00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:52.360
on separate schools
or anything like that.

541
00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.480
They didn't mention
politics at all.

542
00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:57.560
They simply showed
successful black men

543

dressed in ties and suits.

544
00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:04.720
behaving like
good executives would.

545
00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:08.080
This was a time when schools
were still segregated here.

546
00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:10.360
when a black man who dared

547
00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:11.880
to walk into
a white neighborhood

548

may not walk out.

549
00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:16.520
It was very brave.

550
00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:20.560
I think it just fits with the
entire enterprising character
of the company.

551
00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:24.680
to realize that there's
an entire demographic

and who wants to have
a good time.

554
00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.880

these Walker guys did.

that Johnnie Walker

was to make the label

So that was
like the final nail

That's just not an option.

996
01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:27.360
We needed a new college.

997
01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:30.480
The college
was from the 1960s.

998
01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:33.160
Eight acres of the site
was donated for a pound.

999
01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:36.080
and a new Â£50 million college
was built.

1000
01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:37.360
funded by the
Scottish government.

1001
01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:41.160
So the legacy
that Diageo is leaving

1002
01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:43.600
is just the start
of another journey

1003
01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:46.640

we have been
at the forefront of driving.

is still alive.

but it's just the different
shoes that keep on walking.

1006
01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:05.080
I think today...
I think a brand is much more

1007
01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.680
about a movement
than just about trust.

1008
01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:10.960
You gotta think about it
as a movement.

What are you trying
to bring to the world?

1011
01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:18.080
As an example. I think Apple
is a very good example
of that movement.

1012
01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:21.200
It was bringing computing
to the people.

1013
01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:25.960
That was its great thing.
And therefore.
a brand has to stand for more.

Are we about the future?
Are we making
this product in a way

1015
01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:32.600
which is sustainable?
Are we caring for the planet?

1016

The new consumer.
certainly the millennial
consumer

1019
01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:43.960
would like to see companies
giving back to communities.

1020
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.640
I think they would also
like to see in some ways

1021
01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:53.120
an understanding
and an appreciation
for the heritage of a brand.

of just making something

1023
01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:01.200
and being a sort of
hazy figure in the distance.

1024
01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:03.240
that doesn't work
for people anymore.

1025
01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:05.120
We want to know
where our money's going

1026
01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:07.360
because every dollar
that we spend is a vote.

1027
01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:10.320
So we want to know
who's behind the brand?

1028
01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:12.320
What do they believe in?
What is their ethos?

1029
01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:14.120
How do they treat the people
at their company?

1030
01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.600
Do they pay them fair wages?

1031
01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:18.160
Do employees get maternity
and paternity leave?

1032
01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:21.200
These things are important
to consumers now.

1033
01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:28.280
I think the future is about
being thoughtfully inclusive.

1034
01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:29.680
I think the future is about

1035
01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:32.520
building bigger tables
and longer bars

1036
01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:35.000

and toast together.

to advance the world for good.

is that willing to

1042
01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:58.160
"put their neck out there."

1043

1047
01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:13.000
If it's possible.
we have to contribute to that.

1048
01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:25.320
ESHUN: I think the old anxiety
was that in getting
into bed with a brand.

1049
01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:28.640
you'd have to change.
you'd have to become
a corporate shill

1050
01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:30.480
or something like that.
Now it's the opposite.

1051
01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:33.120
Now it feels like brands
spend a lot of time

1052
01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:37.880

sort of powerfully totemic
individuals themselves

1053
01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:41.960
that can speak all around
the world at the same time.

1054

Social media has disrupted
so many of these traditional
forms of communication.

1055
01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:50.280
so right now. you know.
you can go to Instagram

1056

a much more intimate
relationship with a star.

HEGARTY: I'm slightly
suspicious of those things.

1058
01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:02.600
Every other ad for a watch
has got a star in it.

1059
01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:06.080
The brand should be the hero.

1060
01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:08.640
Don't go and buy another hero.

1061
01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:11.440
The advertising world
is perhaps skeptical

1062
01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:14.920
of the role of brand ambassadors
and the environment we have

1063
01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:18.160
where culture and commerce
blend together
that much more easily.

1064
01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:22.040
Because what gets
left out of that game
is the idea

1065
01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:27.200
that the thing the brand needs
to do to sell itself
is a 30-second commercial.

1066
01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:30.960
That feels like a fantastically
anachronistic idea right now.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.160
when in fact you can
cut out the middleman

1068
01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:36.080

to the individual
