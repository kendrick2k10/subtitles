Maintain the line!

4
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Hold the line!

5
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
The wind is turning!

6
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
-We got no escape route!
-We know. get the gear!

7
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Leo. get back here!

8
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
-Come on!
-Leo!

9
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Fire's turned!

10
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Fall back!
- Help us. please!

11
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Morning. ma'am.

12
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I'm with the Fire Department.
he's with Florida Gas.

13
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Yeah. our system alerted us
to a gas leak where our main

14
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Is your husband home?

15
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
He's in the shower.
Should we get out of the house?

16
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
No. this is as likely
a computer error

17
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
we should check to be safe.

18
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
-May we come in?
-Please. yes.

19
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
-Thank you. ma'am.
- Yeah. thank you.

20
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Hey. how far away
is Jacksonville?

21
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
With traffic? Six hours.

22
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Maybe more.

23
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
You got blood on your shirt.

24
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
You should change
before we continue.

25
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Well I'd hate to take a detour.
This'll be on the news

26
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
If he has any sense
he'll be on the move

27
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Uh. it'll take him a day
to get the courage.

28
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
We'll be there. besides.
We don't take

29
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
-I'm sorry.
-Happens.

30
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Come on. bud.
We're gonna be late.

31
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
...light winds out

32
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Expect a high
of 74 degrees...

33
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
In financial news.
commercial real estate

34
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
-What's "obtuse" mean?
-Mmm.

35
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Like. annoyingly insensitive.

36
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Has a girl ever
called  you  obtuse?

37
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Only your mother. son.

38
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Were you?

39
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
It could also mean. like.
very slow to understand.

40
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
I'm pretty sure I was that.

41
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
That makes more sense.

42
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Just tell her you're sorry
and you'll try harder.

43
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
I'm not taking dating advice
from you. Dad.

44
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Can girls have cooties
for one more year. please.

45
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
while I mentally prepare
for what's coming?

46
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
This is the scene

47
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
at the home
of District Attorney

48
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
where it is now believed
he and his family were killed

49
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
in what fire officials
are calling

50
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Fort Lauderdale's
police chief

51
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
to work closely
with fire officials

52
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
to find a definitive cause
of this tragedy.

53
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
that has cost
this community a family

54
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
and one of its most
beloved leaders.

55
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Dad. you all right?

56
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000
We're gonna be late.

57
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
-You ready?
-Yep.

58
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Let's go.

59
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Right over there.

60
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Let's go.

61
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Jeez. Dad.
what's wrong with you?

62
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
-Dad. what are you doing?
-We're playing hooky.

63
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
I don't want to play hooky.
I have a chemistry exam

64
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000
We're playing hooky!

65
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
-

66
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
No! No more texting.
No phone. okay?

67
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Just give it to me.
Give... Give me the phone!

68
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Are you in trouble?
What did you do?

69
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
The right thing.
you understand me?

70
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
I did the right thing.

71
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
If you did the right thing.
then why are you so scared?

72
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
The great history of
smokejumpers now rests

73
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
With every jump you make.
every fire you turn...

74
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Look at those babies.
- Yup.

75
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Hey. top me
off here. boss.

76
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
You can't wait 15 minutes
for the party at the bar?

77
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Shut the fuck up. you were
drunk when I picked you up

78
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
That's very true.

79
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Self-medicating your
way through it. huh?

80
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Oh. ladies and gentlemen.

81
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Ethan. where do they teach you
that stare that y'all have?

82
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Not that one. That one.
That one. right there.

83
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
-That one right here?
- Oh. that one.

84
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
-You feel it. Benny?
-I can see it right through

85
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Going right into
my heart. my soul.

86
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Just a lot of hours
in front of the mirror. bud.

87
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Oh. I bet. Mean and sexy.

88
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Why'd they put you
in a fire tower?

89
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Well. I'm just lucky. I guess.

90
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
-Yeah. fuck them
and their tests.

91
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Fuck them.

92
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
-Fuck 'em all.
-Which tower?

93
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
217. close to you.

94
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
So keep the barbecues low.
or I'm gonna have to send

95
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Right. All right. listen.

96
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
I'd really like today
to go different

97
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
and the year before that
and every other fucking

98
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
-Last year was fun.
-All right.

99
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
So. who can tell me
what the goal of the day is?

100
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Threesome sounds
pretty good.

101
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Or winning the lottery.

102
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Threesome for you
would  be winning the lottery.

103
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000
-That's fucked up.
-Very true.

104
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
The goal.
you fucking clowns.

105
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
-No fighting.
- Exactly right.

106
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And please do not
jump off of shit

107
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
-Oh. who would do that?
-Oh. I have no idea.

108
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
I... am older now.
and...

109
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Well. I'm older.

110
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
-Just trying to keep you alive.
-Hey. no. no. hey. hey.

111
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Don't you worry about that.
That's our job.

112
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
You just write
the parking tickets

113
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Fair enough.

114
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
-Make good choices. please.
-Oh. here's to good choices.

115
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Good choices!
- Now we're talking.

116
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
I'm feeling naughty.

117
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Well. me being
the team player...

118
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
-I guess I can
help you with that.

119
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
I do not have sex with a man
I have seen shit in the woods.

120
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Get the fuck out of here.
I have the very same rule.

121
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
You don't have sex with men
who shit in the woods?

122
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
-Who the fuck are you kidding?
- Oh. are we

123
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Are we too loud. Ethan?
I'm sorry. I'm so--

124
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
-How about this?
Congratulations!

125
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Congratulations!

126
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Come on now.

127
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Would you
just get into this?

128
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Could you just get
your head in the game?

129
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Hey. do you want to
dance with the devil?

130
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
I'm gonna show you how to
dance with the devil right now.

131
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
-Ooh!
-Listen. the objective

132
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
That's what she said.
-I'm gonna show you

133
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Boss...
you're up. let's go.

134
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
I do nothing involving
the word "corn."

135
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Oh. you coward.

136
00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Yes!

137
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000
See? That's how it's done.

138
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
-Nothing left to prove.
- How can I follow that?

139
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Give me that.
This is how you follow it.

140
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Yeah! Yeah!

141
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
I'm not judging.
I'm just trying to understand.

142
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
That's your
fucking boyfriend?

143
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000
-Yes.
-

144
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
I can't get my fucking
head around it.

145
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
I don't understand.
why is it so funny to you?

146
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Oh. fuck.
dude this is perfect!

147
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
He's trying to quit smoking.
Stop being a fucking dick.

148
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
-Vic! Ryan!
She's... She's doing it!

149
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000
She's fucking doing it.
come on!

150
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
-Parachute!
-Come on!

151
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
You've learned nothing!

152
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
-Oh. fuck!
-Let's go!

153
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
things I lost

154
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Oh. fuck.

155
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Shit.

156
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
I remember the landing
being softer last time.

157
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Nope. It went
pretty much like that.

158
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
What are you gonna do.
arrest me?

159
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Huh?

160
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Fuck.

161
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
You wonder why
you failed your

162
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Did you tighten these
with a fucking torque wrench?

163
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Oh. does it hurt?

164
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
-Yeah. it fucking hurts.
-Good. Maybe you'll

165
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Hey. eyes on me.
Quit your sulking. all right?

166
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
You got yourself here.
This shit is on you.

167
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Fucking earned it.

168
00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Let's go.

169
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Here's the thing.

170
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
We both know
that had nothing

171
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
and it sure as shit wasn't
an accident. all right?

172
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Look. H..
I know what

173
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Maybe those other assholes.
they don't see it.

174
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
You know.
maybe a summer in a fire tower

175
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
-Maybe.
-Mm-hmmm.

176
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Maybe I'll just jump.

177
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Jesus Christ.

178
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000
It doesn't look like
they took anything.

179
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Toothbrushes still
in the bathroom.

180
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
They're gone.

181
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
We need a destination.
I'll take the computer.

182
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
He withdrew $10.000
from his account.

183
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
We need to know the friend
or family member

184
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000
All right.

185
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Come on.

186
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Where are you going?

187
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Uh... How about the one
in law enforcement?

188
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Survival school.

189
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
This keeps getting better.

190
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
What do you know

191
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000
-You're an accountant.
-Yeah.

192
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
At least I thought you were.

193
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
I'm a forensic accountant.
which means...

194
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
I look for things
that don't add up.

195
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
And I found some.

196
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
The man I work for.
he was killed today

197
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
But I still know it.
which means they're gonna...

198
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
They're gonna
come after me. too.

199
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
-We need to go to the police.
-No.

200
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
The DA has police protection
24 hours a day.

201
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
And where were they
this morning?

202
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
The case implicates
a lot of people. son.

203
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Governors. congressmen...
We can only trust

204
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
You understand me?

205
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Yeah.

206
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
-Hey. baby.
-Hey. you.

207
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
-How's the bun?
-Cooking.

208
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Just. come here.

209
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Good to see you.

210
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
-Mmm. How was your day?
-Oh. same old.

211
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Really?
-Mm-hmm.

212
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
I heard
you had a little run-in

213
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Well. she's just letting her
demons run the show.

214
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
You weren't too hard
on her. were you?

215
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Maybe I was
a little hard on her.

216
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
But you know something.
she's an asshole.

217
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000
She deserves it.

218
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
She's plenty hard on herself

219
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
and she probably doesn't
need any help from you.

220
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Nothing like arguing
with my wife about how I spoke

221
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Especially when
my wife takes her side.

222
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
I'm not taking her side.
I'm just not taking yours.

223
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
You are taking her side.
because I don't even

224
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Then you're on her side.

225
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
What is that.
like an accusation?

226
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
-Baby. are we fighting?
-

227
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
God. men are simple.

228
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
We're not fighting. babe.
Dinner's on the stove.

229
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
There's beer in the fridge.
All's right with the world.

230
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Oh. did you feel that one?

231
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
-Uh-uh. No.
-Oh. my God. how did you

232
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
I just didn't. baby.

233
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
-I think I know what it is.
-Hmm? What is it?

234
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
I think it's that
concrete skull of yours.

235
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
I love how somehow
it's my fault that I don't feel

236
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Oh. babe.
everything's your fault.

237
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
-Everything is my--
-The baby is your fault.

238
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
See. scientifically speaking.
it's 50% my fault.

239
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
-Is that what you think?
-That's what I think.

240
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
-You know what I think?
-Oh. no. you're gonna

241
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000
-Uh-huh.
-Oh. no!

242
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
I think that
everything is your fault

243
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
-We clear?
-Ah! We're so clear. baby.

244
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
We're so clear. Mmm.

245
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
-

246
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Ah!

247
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Hello?

248
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
-Allison. It's Owen.
-  Owen!

249
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Hey. Could I talk to Ethan?

250
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
-Um. I got a real problem.
-  Okay.

251
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Owen. how you doing. man?

252
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Hey. Ethan. Um...
I've been better.

253
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000
What's going on?

254
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
-Hi. buddy.
- Hey.

255
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
What are you writing?

256
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000
It's for you.

257
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
It's all my secrets.

258
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
But I don't
want you to read it...

259
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
Promise?

260
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
What am I supposed to
do with it?

261
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Give it to
someone you trust.

262
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000
When?

263
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
With a little luck. never.

264
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
I'm really sorry
about this. son.

265
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
You did the right thing.

266
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Right?

267
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Yeah.

268
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000
I'm still sorry.

269
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000
That's it. Thanks.

270
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
-All good?
-Yeah. good.

271
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Wasn't sure what you needed.
so I brought options.

272
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
-Yeah. we'll take the truck.
-Roger that.

273
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
It's a lot to swallow. Ethan.
How well do you know this guy?

274
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000
He was married to my sister.
The kid. he's...

275
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Top you off?
-Yeah.

276
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000
-Would you like some?
-I'm okay. sweetheart.

277
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Sure you don't want
a piece of this steak?

278
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
You know I don't
eat that crap.

279
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000
-Yeah.
-That shit right there

280
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
I think I rode this
ol' bull back in the '70s.

281
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
I don't blame you for
not eating this meat.

282
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
I don't know
what you want me

283
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Well. I'm not sure
what I want

284
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
If he's telling the truth.

285
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
he needs the Marshal Service.
or the FBI.

286
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
I said the same. but...

287
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Like. he wanted me
to call a TV station.

288
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
Don't be calling
no goddamn TV station.

289
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
-We're not trying
to invent a story here.

290
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000
You let me know as soon
as he gets to your house.

291
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
-I want to see
this guy in person.

292
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
We're done.

293
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000
-Go. uh... stop crime.
-I'll do my best.

294
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000
You know. you should...
maybe consider a salad.

295
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
-Who eats salad for breakfast?
- Fair enough.

296
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
-Sheriff?

297
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Your wife's calling.
Do you want to take the call?

298
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Absolutely not.

299
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Connor!

300
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
Hey. Connor!

301
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Back away from it.

302
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
It's okay. Dad.

303
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
He's nice.

304
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
We gotta go. come on.

305
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Connor.

306
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
Lynx lookout. copy?

307
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Copy. Lynx.

308
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
I see thunderclouds
and 30-mile-an-hour wind.

309
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000
Is there any precipitation
in that storm?

310
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Lynx. keep this frequency clear
unless you see smoke.

311
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
This ain't a party line.

312
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000
Copy.

313
00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Jackass.

314
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Hold the line!

315
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
Shit! The wind is turning!

316
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000
That was our exit route!

317
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000
They got the wind wrong!

318
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000
We're fucking trapped!

319
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
Hannah!
What the fuck are we doing?

320
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000
-Deploy! Deploy!
- Deploy!

321
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
Get the gear!

322
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
No. no. no. I ain't cooking

323
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000
Leo! Leo. get back here!

324
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Leo! Watch out!

325
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
Hannah!
Get in your shelter.

326
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Help us. please!
- Hey. help me. please!

327
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
-Hannah. they're gone.
- Help! Help me. please!

328
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
-They're gone!
-

329
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
Fire tower
217 Lynx. this is base.

330
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
This isn't a party line.

331
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Or so I'm told.

332
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Fuck that little prick.
He rides a scooter

333
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
How you holding up?

334
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000
I'm in a 20-by-20 box
on stilts

335
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
I have to get out of here.

336
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
I'll call you
on the sat phone.

337
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
-Hey.
-  You somewhere better?

338
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Define "better."

339
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Giving you
a psych eval three days

340
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000
None of us could have passed.

341
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
Forest Service
looking for someone to blame

342
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000
I read the wind wrong.

343
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
They read it wrong.
then told you wrong.

344
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
Not your fault.

345
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000
What choice did you have?

346
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000
I should have gone to them.
and instead

347
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Then you'd be dead. too.

348
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
Well... that's our job.

349
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Do you think about it?

350
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
Every day.

351
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000
Listen. don't do
anything stupid.

352
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
There's a lot of people
who care about you.

353
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
-Yeah.
-  Come on. there's me.

354
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000
There's me.

355
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Hey. you see that storm cell
12 o'clock to the tower?

356
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000
-You see that on the Doppler?
-  Yeah. it should bank north.

357
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
No. it's not banking north.

358
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Can you imagine what
Lewis and Clark must have

359
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Do you think
they came this way?

360
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000
Right this way.
This is the Lewis

361
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
All we did was pave it.

362
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000
I like it out here.

363
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000
I like the space of it.

364
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000
That's a good spot.

365
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000
You'll have line of sight.

366
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
Time since we last saw a car?

367
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
It's six minutes.

368
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000
-It's a pretty good window.
-We do it here.

369
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
Veer off. you bastard.

370
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000
Fuck me.

371
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000
Vehicle approaching.
two klicks out.

372
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000
Driver is female.
Montana plates.

373
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Alfa. echo. kilo.
five. five niner.

374
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Registered to
a Deborah Killdeer

375
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000
Motherfucker.

376
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000
-Are you gonna help?
-Absolutely not.

377
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000
-Duck!
-

378
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Ah!

379
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000
There's a fallen tree.
right there to the right.

380
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000
Don't make a sound. okay?
No matter what you see.

381
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
Creeks lead to rivers.
rivers lead to towns.

382
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000
You call the news.
you call the TV station.

383
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
You give them this.

384
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000
I want to stay with you.

385
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
I love you. son.

386
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000
Go! Go.

387
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000
-You all right?
-Yeah.

388
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000
Didn't see that coming.

389
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000
-There's movement.
-Will this fucker ever die?

390
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000
-We're blown.
-Fuck.

391
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
Are you okay?
Did somebody go over the edge?

392
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000
No. ma'am. it's okay.
Everything's fine.

393
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000
Hey. sweetheart.
did they. uh...

394
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000
No. not yet.
-Huh.

395
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000
Are you almost home?

396
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000
Yeah. I'm like
five minutes out.

397
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000
-Babe. let me call you back.
-Sure. okay. Bye. babe.

398
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000
Shit.
We left that scene a mess.

399
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000
Oh. you want to clean it up?

400
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000
It is what it is.
This job needed two teams.

401
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000
Fucking two teams.
like I told 'em.

402
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Fascinating where they
decide to save money.

403
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000
All units. code three.

404
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000
-That was fast.
-That's the consequence

405
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000
Two deceased.
one white male. mid-40s.

406
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000
-  one white female. early 30s.
-There's no boy.

407
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000
You think they're looking down
from the street.

408
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000
Yes. sir. Where?

409
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000
Yeah. we're en route.

410
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000
En route where?

411
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000
He wants to meet.

412
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000
What. he's here?
Why is he here?

413
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000
He's... Fuck! Fuck!

414
00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Please! Help us!

415
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000
Hey. wait!

416
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000
Hey!

417
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000
Stop!

418
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.000
Come here.

419
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000
I'm not gonna hurt you.

420
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000
Stop! Stop!
I'm not gonna hurt you.

421
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000
I want to see where
the blood's coming from.

422
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000
It's not my blood.

423
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Whose blood is it?

424
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
All right. listen.

425
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000
My name is Hannah.
What's yours?

426
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000
-Fuck you.
-Oh. nice.

427
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000
I'm a firefighter.

428
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000
I work with
the Forest Service.

429
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000
All right?

430
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000
Talk to me and I'm
gonna help you. okay?

431
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000
All right.

432
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000
Good luck!

433
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000
Good luck.

434
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000
Town is 12 miles that way...

435
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.000
over the Continental Divide.

436
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000
Have fun with that.

437
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000
Wait!

438
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000
Yeah?

439
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000
I have a radio in a tower...
over there.

440
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000
-We can call the sheriff or--
-No. not the sheriff. the news.

441
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000
Can you call the news?

442
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000
Yeah. Sure. I...
I can call whoever

443
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000
You're fucking fast.

444
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000
Man!

445
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000
-Want me to drop you closer?
-He doesn't want us any closer.

446
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000
Okay.

447
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000
Pull around the front.
I'll meet you there

448
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000
-What's with the limp?
-It's nothing.

449
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000
You missed the boy.

450
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.000
That seems unlikely.

451
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000
Hmm.

452
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000
We promise absolutes.
and "unlikely"

453
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000
The man was resourceful enough
to make it all the way here.

454
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000
so assume
he was resourceful enough

455
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000
of everything we retrieved
from the DA's office.

456
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000
And assume
that those duplicates are

457
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000
Assume the worst
case scenario.

458
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
Assume catastrophe and...

459
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000
act accordingly.

460
00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.000
It's a lot of risk.

461
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000
That. I am aware of.

462
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000
You have. what.
maybe six hours

463
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000
I can buy us more time.

464
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000
But they have to
have the stomach for it.

465
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000
I will make them
have the stomach for it.

466
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000
Should have been
two teams.

467
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000
Hit 'em
at the same time.

468
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000
What got us here
doesn't really matter.

469
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000
-No. it doesn't.
-No. it doesn't.

470
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
It's a zero-sum game.
Treat it that way.

471
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000
-Are we going to the station?
-Brother-in-law...

472
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000
I think.

473
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Maybe we get lucky.

474
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000
This is a lot of risk
for a boy.

475
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000
Well. they're worried
about what he might know.

476
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000
And what he saw us do.

477
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.000
From this point forward.
we put down anyone

478
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:55.000
That's gonna bring a lot
of attention to this town.

479
00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000
Give 'em something else
to worry about.

480
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Let 'em focus on this
for a while.

481
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000
Yep.

482
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000
Allie. there's
no sign of Connor.

483
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.000
Well. are they looking?

484
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000
Yeah. they're gonna set up
a search crew. but...

485
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000
Ethan?
Ethan. are you still there?

486
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000
Oh. God.

487
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000
Let's get you warm.

488
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000
You hungry?

489
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.000
No.

490
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000
Well. you should eat anyway.

491
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000
Here. Here's some...

492
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000
Candy and shit in it. Here.

493
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000
So. here's the deal. buddy.

494
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000
The tower
was hit by lightning.

495
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000
So we can't...

496
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.000
Fucker.

497
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000
So we can't
call the sheriff. or...

498
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000
fuck me... anybody.

499
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000
We are gonna have to
hike to town.

500
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000
So I need to know whether
we should do that tonight.

501
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000
or if we can wait
till morning.

502
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000
Are you in trouble?

503
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

504
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000
Anyone else in trouble?
Anyone we need

505
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000
Not anymore.

506
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000
All right.

507
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000
Well...

508
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000
You don't seem
much up for a hike.

509
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000
My dad said if anything
happened to him.

510
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000
I should find someone
I can trust.

511
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000
Something happen
to your dad?

512
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000
Are you someone
I can trust?

513
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000
I'm absolutely
someone you can trust.

514
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.000
Where'd they find him?

515
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000
On the road.

516
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.000
I hid under a tree.

517
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000
And ran down to the creek.

518
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.000
'Cause creeks lead to rivers.
and rivers lead to towns.

519
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000
That they do.

520
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000
All right. Okay.

521
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000
-Are we leaving tonight?
-We're leaving right now.

522
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000
The fire has now jumped

523
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000
and is moving
toward Highway 12.

524
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000
Winds are north-northwest
at seven miles per hour.

525
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000
We are currently at
zero percent containment...

526
00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000
Babe. I have been calling--

527
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000
-Can I help you?
-I'm Agent Freers.

528
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.000
Were with the FBI.
Is Deputy Sawyer here?

529
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000
He's still on duty.
You can try him on your radio.

530
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.000
-We run different frequencies.
-Change the channel.

531
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000
We spoke earlier
and he asked us

532
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000
Do you mind if we come in?

533
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000
Yes. I do.

534
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000
Show me your hands.

535
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.000
House is clear.

536
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000
I think she's pregnant.

537
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.000
You pregnant?

538
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.000
-How many months?
-Six.

539
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.000
Boy or girl?

540
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000
Girl.

541
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:18.000
Well. I want you to think
about her when I ask you

542
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.000
You run a survival school?

543
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.000
Telling me the truth
is how you survive.

544
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000
-Is the boy here?
-No.

545
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000
-Has he been here?
-No.

546
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000
-Have the police found him?
-Not that I know of

547
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.000
-But this is where he'll come?
-I don't know.

548
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:50.000
Now. that sounds like
you're telling us the truth.

549
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000
we have to know.

550
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000
I am telling the truth.

551
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.000
I have to know.

552
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000
I am telling the truth!

553
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000
I have to know.

554
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000
I'm telling the truth.

555
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000
Okay. my husband found him!
My husband found him!

556
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000
-He's with my husband!
-Where'd he take him?

557
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000
I don't know.
he didn't tell me!

558
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:23.000
-I can call him!
- Okay.

559
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000
Call him.

560
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.000
Where's the phone?

561
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000
You keep this
conversation casual.

562
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000
You hear me?

563
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000
Okay.

564
00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:00.000
Hey. baby.
I'm dealing with this fire.

565
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.000
Hey. babe. how's the...
how's the boy?

566
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000
-  What?
-Is he hungry?

567
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.000
I bet he's hungry.
I'll make him something to eat

568
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.000
That's a distress word.
You gave him a fucking

569
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000
You fucking survivalists!

570
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000
You wanna survive?
I'll give you something

571
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.000
-You're pointing
that the wrong way.

572
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.000
-You good?
-No. I'm fucking not.

573
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.000
Fuck!

574
00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.000
I'm a mother pheasant plucker.

575
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000
I'm the most pleasant
mother pheasant plucker to

576
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:06.000
I'm a pheasant mother plucker.
I pluck mother pheasants.

577
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.000
-I'm the most pleasant
mother pheasant...

578
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000
Ooh!
- The most

579
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000
All right. break's over.

580
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.000
Okay. we gotta get downhill.

581
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000
We're gonna take turns running.
When I say "stop." you stop.

582
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.000
You get down like this.
and I'm gonna run past you.

583
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000
We're gonna keep switching.
Okay. ready? Go. run!

584
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.000
Down!

585
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.000
Run!

586
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000
Down!

587
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:40.000
Run!

588
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000
No. no.

589
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000
Please. please.

590
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.000
You got hit.

591
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.000
Missed me.

592
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000
You got hit.

593
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000
No. buddy. it missed me.

594
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000
We gotta go.

595
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000
He died right in front of me.

596
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:43.000
Let it out. buddy.
Let it out.

597
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000
There's no blood trail.

598
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:58.000
-You think we got her?
-It's 50-50.

599
00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000
Ah. fuck.

600
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:04.000
-You okay? Don't look good.
-Well. there's nothing

601
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.000
Go deep.

602
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.000
Allie?

603
00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:23.000
Dispatch. this is Alpha One.
We need two more guys.

604
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000
-

605
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000
Drop your weapon!
Drop it! Drop it now!

606
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000
Drop it right fucking now!

607
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:36.000
Drop your fucking weapon!
Step in the road.

608
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.000
Stop. Face away from me.

609
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:44.000
You're about to be a father.
That's the only thought

610
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.000
Now. very slowly.
unbuckle your service belt.

611
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000
drop it to the ground.
toss it to the left.

612
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.000
Drop to your knees.

613
00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000
Allow yourself
to fall forward.

614
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:03.000
Fall forward.

615
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.000
Hands behind your back.

616
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000
-Backup weapon?
-Right ankle.

617
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:15.000
We have another man
with your wife.

618
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.000
On my word.
she will be executed.

619
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.000
You will not be
a father anymore.

620
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000
-Do you understand?
-I understand.

621
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.000
According to your wife.
the boy's with you.

622
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000
Now. if that were true.
there'd be a much bigger

623
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.000
police presence
in your yard right now.

624
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000
The boy hasn't been found.

625
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:32.000
We think he was tossed
from the vehicle in the crash.

626
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.000
There's a search crew who was
gonna go out in the morning.

627
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.000
but that got called off
because of the fire.

628
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.000
Search is exactly what
you and I are going to do.

629
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000
Jack...

630
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000
You really think we should
leave that loose end?

631
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:48.000
Clock is ticking.
We don't have time

632
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.000
Okay. let's go.

633
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.000
Up.

634
00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.000
A few years from now.
you are gonna find yourself

635
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.000
or a forest behind your house.
with some saucy blonde.

636
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:08.000
and you are gonna want
to take full advantage

637
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:13.000
Campfires are like catnip
for teenage girls.

638
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:17.000
And all you need
is some fuel.

639
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.000
and  voila!

640
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:24.000
You're swapping spit
with a cheerleader.

641
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:29.000
-Getting struck by lightning
made you weird.

642
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.000
You just look sad to me.

643
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.000
I look sad?

644
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.000
There was a fire last year
that I was in charge

645
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000
And...

646
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:58.000
I thought the wind
was doing one thing.

647
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:03.000
So instead of fighting it.
we found ourselves

648
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:07.000
Which is not where
you want to be.

649
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:14.000
And there were three boys...

650
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000
around your age...

651
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:22.000
They got caught in the fire.
and all I could do was watch.

652
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.000
I watched my mother
die of cancer.

653
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:38.000
It is impossible to feel sorry
for myself around you.

654
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.000
I'm sorry.

655
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:46.000
Me. too.

656
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000
All right. Let's just...

657
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.000
Let's get you warm. buddy.

658
00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:59.000
-My dad called me buddy.
-Aw. fuck.

659
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:02.000
I'm sorry.
I won't call you buddy.

660
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.000
No. it's fine.

661
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000
You can call me buddy.

662
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000
I'm warm. Let's go.

663
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000
No fucking way
the kid survived that.

664
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.000
Well. he ain't here.

665
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.000
You want to
search up the hill?

666
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000
Like I said.
they'll send a team.

667
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.000
I'll check it out.

668
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000
I'll tell you this much.
I've seen a thousand wrecks.

669
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:36.000
There's no way
somebody survives that.

670
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:40.000
Well. good.
Should be easy to find then.

671
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Hey. whoa. whoa. whoa.
What was that?

672
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Move.

673
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Yeah. the kid made it.

674
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Guess we're about to judge
your tracking skills. deputy.

675
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
No. I don't think
you're gonna judge shit.

676
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Yeah. I think I'm done.

677
01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000
I think I'm gonna
go ahead. I'm...

678
01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
I'm just gonna
keep my dignity.

679
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Look. we know how this thing's
gonna end. right?

680
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Fuck it. I know.

681
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
So let's just fucking
do it now. huh?

682
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Play your cards right. Deputy.
you could live through this.

683
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
What the fuck do I look like?
Do I...

684
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000
I look like
the stupidest motherfucker

685
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
-Take a couple
of steps back. Jack.

686
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
You gonna
let me live. huh?

687
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
-Yeah.
-Oh. fuck that'd be mistake.

688
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
You let me live and
I will shout your description

689
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
to anybody
who will fucking listen.

690
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
-No. you won't.
-I'll fucking hunt you down!

691
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.000
You hear this fucking guy?
If I play my cards right. huh?

692
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
-I will fucking kill you.
-Fucking kill me. Shoot me.

693
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
-What are you waiting for?
-Give me the word. Jack.

694
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Come on. give him the word.
I'm gonna fucking

695
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
-Right here!
-Jack. give me the word.

696
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Fuck you. And fuck you.

697
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Jack. move left!

698
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
You will not talk. Ever.

699
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
You know why?

700
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Because when
we find this boy.

701
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000
I'm not killing him.
You are.

702
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
That's how bad I don't want
to shoot a pregnant woman.

703
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.000
But you try this shit again.

704
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
I will fucking
burn her alive.

705
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
-Have I made myself clear?
-Yeah.

706
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Yeah?

707
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Now. track.

708
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Move.

709
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000
You okay. brother?

710
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
You're not making much sense
when you talk.

711
01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000
I am so fucking
sick of this place.

712
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
-Is that a fire?
-Yeah.

713
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
And it's a big one.

714
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
We gotta go back.

715
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
I'm not going
through that again.

716
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
We can't go through  that.

717
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
That eats everything
in its path.

718
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
I would have seen this
from the tower.

719
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000
They're gonna send a chopper
to figure out why.

720
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Chopper is that way.
back there.

721
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
You don't get through that.
We're going that way.

722
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000
All right?

723
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Now.

724
01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Oh!

725
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
You.

726
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000
-You okay?
-Oh. yeah. I'm peachy.

727
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000
-Turn around.
-Why? I don't care.

728
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000
We've shared enough today.

729
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Come on.

730
01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Connor. Get down off the bed.

731
01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Get down off the bed.

732
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Quiet.

733
01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Listen...

734
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Those men that
came for your father.

735
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
-Yeah.
-Come here.

736
01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
What?

737
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Is that them?

738
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000
That's them.

739
01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000
-Get under the bed.
-No. We can't stay here.

740
01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
I know. Get under the bed.

741
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Go.

742
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Hey. how many people
stay in those?

743
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Usually one. but...

744
01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000
from the looks of it.
there's nobody home.

745
01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Somebody's home.

746
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000
What kind of fire watcher
leaves his cabin

747
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.000
What are the chances
that fire watcher

748
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000
You're in the forest
of Montana.

749
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
There's no tactical approach
to the top of that tower.

750
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.000
He'll know whoever's up there.
They'll show themselves to him.

751
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
We put them all down from here.
It's the safest play.

752
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Yeah. I don't have
a better idea.

753
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Hey. you're going
up that tower.

754
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Boy's in there.
you're gonna bring him

755
01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
If he isn't.

756
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000
start a fire in the middle
of that cabin and burn it

757
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:43.000
-Why burn it?
-So I know you ain't lying.

758
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Go on. go.

759
01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Move.

760
01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Nobody's here!
The door's locked!

761
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000
It won't be the first door
you've kicked in.

762
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Come on. we need
some higher ground.

763
01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.000
If you're hidden.
you stay hid.

764
01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:33.000
There's a rifle trained on me.
There's two of them

765
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Connor. you're doing great.

766
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000
You just stay there.
okay?

767
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Don't move. Don't talk.

768
01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
You got a weapon in here. H.?

769
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
I have a pretty sharp axe.

770
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Afraid that's not gonna do it.

771
01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
I. uh...

772
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
I don't know how to
get us out of this.

773
01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.000
The fire's gonna be here
in about an hour.

774
01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000
We don't have an hour.

775
01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Fuck.

776
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000
I see nothing.
No movement.

777
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000
He's just standing there.

778
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000
I'm fading here. partner.

779
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
I know.

780
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Wait. he's talking.

781
01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Yeah. he's talking. Jack.

782
01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Get him out of here. H!

783
01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Run!

784
01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
- Come on. Connor!

785
01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
All right! Okay!

786
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Go. H!

787
01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000
-Come on!
-Go. Connor! Go!

788
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
I got you.

789
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Movement! Running west!
-Fuck.

790
01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Take the shot!
Take the fucking shot!

791
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.000
I got not shot! Fuck!

792
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Okay. We move.

793
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
-Contact. right!

794
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.000
That was a deer rifle.

795
01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
All right.
I'll take the shooter.

796
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.000
If there's even a chance
that it's her...

797
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
All right.

798
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Rendezvous back here.

799
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Can you cover me?

800
01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
-Moving.
-Move.

801
01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Keep going.

802
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Toward the fire?

803
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Yeah. buddy.

804
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
-

805
01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
-

806
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Just...

807
01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
stop for
a fucking minute!

808
01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Where's my husband?

809
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Tower.

810
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000
-Is he alive?
-I don't know.

811
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000
You're out.

812
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Fuck.

813
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
I hate this fucking place.

814
01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000
It hates you back.

815
01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Go.

816
01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Come on.

817
01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Come on.

818
01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Come here.

819
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Come here.

820
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Come here.

821
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Listen to me.

822
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000
You're gonna
run a hundred yards

823
01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.000
You're gonna turn left
and you're gonna keep running

824
01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.000
When you get to a creek.
you find the deepest.

825
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000
-and you get in
and you lay down.

826
01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
-You understand?
-No.

827
01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.000
-I'm not--
-No. I'm not leaving you!

828
01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Hundred yards. left. Creek.

829
01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Hundred yards. left.
Say it.

830
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
-Say it! Hundred yards--
-Hundred yards. left.

831
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000
-Hundred yards. left. Creek.
-Hundred yards. left. Creek.

832
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000
When you get there.
what are you gonna do?

833
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000
-Lay down.
-What are you gonna do?

834
01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Lay down.

835
01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Go.

836
01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Go.

837
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Oh. shit. God damn it.

838
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Ethan?

839
01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Hey. sweet girl.

840
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
How did you...

841
01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
-Where you hit. babe?
-Yeah. I can't...

842
01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
I can't tell how bad it is.

843
01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Will you check for an exit?

844
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.000
-Oh. God.
-Okay.

845
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
-Okay.
-Oh. shit.

846
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
How bad is it? Yeah.

847
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000
-It ain't good. babe.
-It's okay.

848
01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
-Okay.
-It's okay.

849
01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.000
-Okay?
-Yeah.

850
01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.000
-Okay.
-Did you get 'em?

851
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000
I got one.
I don't know where

852
01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000
You did good. All right.

853
01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
You gotta
get out of here now.

854
01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
-Hey.
-No. I'm not leaving you.

855
01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
It's about our baby girl.

856
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Nothing matters
if she don't make it.

857
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
No one makes it
through that. baby.

858
01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.000
-

859
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Come on.

860
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
You really want
to die for this kid?

861
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
You don't even know him.

862
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:23.000
You know. if you walk away...
right now. I won't fire.

863
01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.000
You got my word. okay?

864
01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Just walk away.

865
01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Hey! You looking for me?

866
01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Fuck you!

867
01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Connor. run!

868
01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Connor!

869
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
You're gonna hide. huh?

870
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:17.000
I'll show you what happens
when you run and hide.

871
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
When you come out.
I'll stop.

872
01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Keep hiding.
I'll keep hurting her.

873
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
You watching this? Huh?

874
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.000
-Don't come out!
-Shut the fuck up!

875
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000
If I come out.
will you let her go?

876
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
No. I won't.

877
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:48.000
You know. it won't be this.
She won't suffer.

878
01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Okay.

879
01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Stop!

880
01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.000
