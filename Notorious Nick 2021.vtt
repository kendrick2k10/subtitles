My dad promised
he'd buy me one when I turn 16.

- Where is he?
- Don't know.

41
00:05:06.757 --> 00:05:08.491
What do you mean you
"don't know"?

42
00:05:08.525 --> 00:05:10.828
He left when I was a baby.

43
00:05:10.861 --> 00:05:13.197
Well. he sucks.

Listen. if you don't believe in
yourself why would anybody else?

75
00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.726

00:08:10.207 --> 00:08:14.345
polished up with a two-tone metal flake
blue and green and a white pearl finish.

81
00:08:17.948 --> 00:08:20.017
I have no idea
what you just said.

82
00:08:21.752 --> 00:08:23.087
Chicks dig bikes.

83
00:08:25.756 --> 00:08:26.957
Keep telling yourself that.

84
00:08:28.826 --> 00:08:31.128
Wait. is that jealousy I smell?

85
00:08:31.162 --> 00:08:34.098
Oh-oh. yes. it is. Nick.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.283
Keep active. keep active.
Active.

91
00:08:52.316 --> 00:08:53.884
Alright.

92
00:09:03.894 --> 00:09:06.230
Okay. okay. okay.
Good. Abi. good.

93
00:09:09.099 --> 00:09:10.099
Good. stand up.

94
00:09:16.173 --> 00:09:19.376
Nick. Nick.

95
00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:21.845
You can't let him
get position like that.

96
00:09:21.879 --> 00:09:24.014
Okay. so here. let's do it.

97
00:09:24.048 --> 00:09:28.152
Alright. if he gets the leg.
then loop your arm like this.

98
00:09:28.185 --> 00:09:30.154
Punch the wizard. there.

99
00:09:30.187 --> 00:09:32.427
Now you've got leverage.
you can throw him over your leg.

100
00:09:34.058 --> 00:09:35.092
Got it?

101
00:09:35.125 --> 00:09:37.261
Questions. comments. concerns?

102
00:09:37.294 --> 00:09:39.930
- Yeah. I got it.
- Okay. Alright. then try.

103
00:09:39.964 --> 00:09:40.998
Your turn. come on.

104
00:09:46.303 --> 00:09:49.406
There you go.
Yeah. there you go. alright.

105
00:09:51.075 --> 00:09:53.410
Loop your arm. loop your arm.
loop your arm!

106
00:09:53.444 --> 00:09:55.279
Faster. faster!

107
00:10:00.918 --> 00:10:02.019
Alright. good. Abi.

108
00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:10.394
Nick. do you know
what happened there?

109
00:10:10.427 --> 00:10:14.798
- Yeah. he kicked my ass.
- Good observation. Do you know why?

110
00:10:14.832 --> 00:10:16.333
That's the key
to getting better.

111
00:10:27.044 --> 00:10:28.412
See how that works?

112
00:10:28.445 --> 00:10:30.414
Left arm behind the head.

113
00:10:30.447 --> 00:10:32.449
You only need your right-hand
to pull this off.

114
00:10:33.917 --> 00:10:35.152
Alright. it's your turn.

115
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:47.530
Not bad.

Come on. get him. Abi. Get him!

126
00:12:23.227 --> 00:12:25.028
Yes!

127
00:12:26.597 --> 00:12:28.232
Good. Abi. good.

It's all yours.

140
00:13:46.109 --> 00:13:47.344
Tough finish.

141
00:13:50.481 --> 00:13:52.282
Geez. Coach.
kid only had one arm.

142
00:13:56.553 --> 00:13:57.655
Good effort.

143
00:13:58.288 --> 00:13:59.691
Hey...

144
00:13:59.724 --> 00:14:01.124

145
00:14:15.305 --> 00:14:17.174
Nick. dinner's ready.

146
00:14:20.444 --> 00:14:22.012
Come on.

147
00:14:25.315 --> 00:14:26.550
What's wrong?

148
00:14:27.719 --> 00:14:30.053
I can't do this. Mom.

149
00:14:30.087 --> 00:14:33.290
Look. the only
disability in life

150
00:14:33.323 --> 00:14:35.158
is a shitty attitude. Nick.

151
00:14:37.461 --> 00:14:38.730
You can do it.

152
00:15:00.852 --> 00:15:04.454
Jim. over here!
Jim. I want you to meet my son.

153
00:15:04.488 --> 00:15:06.490
Jim. hi. how are you?

154
00:15:07.725 --> 00:15:10.093
- Jim Abbott.
- So they tell me.

155
00:15:10.127 --> 00:15:11.763
Mr. Abbott.
my son is a big fan of yours.

156
00:15:11.796 --> 00:15:13.573
I mean. if we could
just have a moment of your time.

157
00:15:13.597 --> 00:15:15.375
He's a wrestler.
he's not very good but he's...

158
00:15:15.399 --> 00:15:16.400
- Mom.
- What?

159
00:15:16.433 --> 00:15:18.569
Wrestling. huh?

160
00:15:18.602 --> 00:15:21.505
I'll tell you what.
I don't have to be back for a few minutes

161
00:15:21.538 --> 00:15:24.842
so why don't we
go over here and have a chat.

162
00:15:24.876 --> 00:15:26.510
Come on. let's go.

163
00:15:32.482 --> 00:15:34.318
So you're a wrestler. huh?

164
00:15:36.353 --> 00:15:37.722
Yeah. but. um...

165
00:15:37.755 --> 00:15:39.389
But what?

166
00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.395
I suck.

167
00:15:46.496 --> 00:15:48.599
Do you want to know something?

168
00:15:48.632 --> 00:15:50.868
I sucked too.
when I was in high school.

169
00:15:52.636 --> 00:15:56.473
But I loved baseball.
more than anything.

170
00:15:57.675 --> 00:15:59.109
And I stuck with it.

171
00:16:02.379 --> 00:16:04.247
If you love wrestling.

172
00:16:04.281 --> 00:16:07.384
you've got to work harder
than everyone else.

173
00:16:09.954 --> 00:16:11.521
But do what you love.

174
00:16:22.967 --> 00:16:24.267
Stick with it.

175
00:16:26.738 --> 00:16:29.172
And never give up.

176
00:16:47.491 --> 00:16:50.327
- Oh. hey. Coach.
- Oh. Nick will be right out.

177
00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.629
Coach. I wanted to talk to you
about something.

178
00:16:52.664 --> 00:16:54.264
Sure. what's up?

179
00:16:54.297 --> 00:16:56.433
I was wondering if you
thought there might be a way

180
00:16:56.466 --> 00:16:58.836
for Nick to get better. quicker.

181
00:17:00.504 --> 00:17:02.572
Well. there's-there's
wrestling camp

182
00:17:02.606 --> 00:17:04.307
over the summer but it's...

183
00:17:04.341 --> 00:17:06.276
- But?
- But it's not cheap.

184
00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:08.509
and I'm never comfortable
spending other people's money.

185
00:17:09.881 --> 00:17:11.749
Alright.
let me worry about that.

186
00:17:37.675 --> 00:17:39.443
Sorry. I'm late.
I'll get dinner ready.

187
00:17:39.476 --> 00:17:41.012
No. don't worry about it.

188
00:17:41.045 --> 00:17:42.780
No. it'll only take me
a few minutes.

189
00:17:42.814 --> 00:17:45.917
- Mom. sit down.
- Hm...

190
00:17:47.819 --> 00:17:48.853
What's wrong?

191
00:17:53.825 --> 00:17:55.258
What's-what's the matter?

192
00:17:56.526 --> 00:17:58.361
Why were these in the trash?

193
00:18:00.832 --> 00:18:02.466
Because Coach Jeremy
thinks you should go

194
00:18:02.499 --> 00:18:04.577
to wrestling camp this summer.
and I happen to be in agreement.

195
00:18:04.601 --> 00:18:05.837
I know.

196
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:07.313
Well. then why didn't you
say anything?

197
00:18:07.337 --> 00:18:08.438
Because we can't afford it.

198
00:18:08.472 --> 00:18:10.708
That is not for you
to worry about.

199
00:18:10.742 --> 00:18:12.442
- I'm not going.
- Yes. you are.

200
00:18:12.476 --> 00:18:13.945
It's already been decided. Nick.

201
00:18:16.681 --> 00:18:19.884
You need that money.
for nursing school. it's important.

202
00:18:19.917 --> 00:18:21.786
It is not as important.

203
00:18:26.523 --> 00:18:28.434
And when you become a parent
one day you will realize

204
00:18:28.458 --> 00:18:30.962
that your kids dreams
come before your own. okay?

205
00:18:31.929 --> 00:18:33.463
Please allow me that.

206
00:18:39.536 --> 00:18:44.307
Just promise me... promise me one day
you're gonna go to nursing school.

207
00:18:44.341 --> 00:18:45.843
Okay. I promise you.

208
00:19:28.052 --> 00:19:30.620
Alright. time to get back
in the game. right?

209
00:19:30.655 --> 00:19:32.622
You've got to get
your head right. out of summer.

210
00:19:32.657 --> 00:19:34.091
Gonna be a great season.

211
00:19:34.125 --> 00:19:36.127
Hey. come on.
Come on. you guys. sit down.

212
00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.428
Join us. Nick. Abi. sit down.

213
00:19:38.461 --> 00:19:39.964
Abi. Nick. welcome back.

214
00:19:39.997 --> 00:19:41.631
Great.

215
00:19:41.666 --> 00:19:43.034
We're gonna suck
again this year.

216
00:19:43.067 --> 00:19:46.771
Hey. Hey. that's enough. Shelby.
It's a team effort.

217
00:19:46.804 --> 00:19:49.006
Then Elbow
doesn't belong on the team.

218
00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.842
Well. you're one to talk Shelby.

219
00:19:50.875 --> 00:19:53.510
Only move your good at
is shitting out of your mouth.

220
00:19:53.543 --> 00:19:54.846
Cool it. Newell.

221
00:19:54.879 --> 00:19:57.347
- Hey...
- You know. how about we wrestle?

222
00:19:58.883 --> 00:20:00.117
Yeah.

223
00:20:00.151 --> 00:20:02.053
How about we wrestle.

224
00:20:02.086 --> 00:20:04.922
Elbow. what dreamland
are you living in?

225
00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:07.524
I want to wrestle him. Coach.

226
00:20:09.492 --> 00:20:11.394
Tell you what.
if you win I'll walk.

227
00:20:14.999 --> 00:20:15.999
Alright. Nick.

228
00:20:17.601 --> 00:20:20.637
So if he wins.
no more nicknames. right?

229
00:20:23.074 --> 00:20:24.541
- Do it. Shelby.
- Alright.

230
00:20:24.574 --> 00:20:25.743
You scared?

231
00:20:28.813 --> 00:20:31.716
Alright. freak. let's do this.

232
00:20:38.656 --> 00:20:39.656
Wrestle.

233
00:20:41.458 --> 00:20:42.894
Come on. Nick. kick his ass.

234
00:20:45.663 --> 00:20:46.664
Where are you going?

235
00:20:50.835 --> 00:20:52.169
You done yet?

236
00:20:52.203 --> 00:20:53.771
Not even close.

237
00:21:00.144 --> 00:21:01.144
Yes!

238
00:21:07.151 --> 00:21:09.086
No. no. no.

239
00:21:10.888 --> 00:21:13.556
Okay. alright. he's pinned.
he's pinned. It's over.

240
00:21:14.557 --> 00:21:15.760
Yes!

241
00:21:15.793 --> 00:21:16.793
Hey!

242
00:21:18.029 --> 00:21:20.231
That's not fair!

243
00:21:20.264 --> 00:21:22.599
I was clearly
outside of the circle.

244
00:21:22.632 --> 00:21:26.603
- What. you want to go again?
- No. no. it's over it's over. Newell won.

245
00:21:26.636 --> 00:21:28.005
No more nicknames. period.

246
00:21:29.907 --> 00:21:31.042
Nice.

247
00:21:41.852 --> 00:21:44.088
Whoo!

248
00:21:50.061 --> 00:21:51.162
You're a beast. man

249
00:21:51.195 --> 00:21:53.130
I agree.

250
00:21:53.164 --> 00:21:56.233
Nick Newell
and Jeff Sommers to the mat.

251
00:21:56.267 --> 00:21:58.601
Alright. alright. listen to me.

252
00:21:58.635 --> 00:22:01.038
this guy is strong.
and he has good technique.

253
00:22:01.072 --> 00:22:02.605
Alright. Any weaknesses?

254
00:22:02.639 --> 00:22:06.010
Uh. nope. he's basically like
the perfect wrestler.

255
00:22:07.678 --> 00:22:11.548
- Sick.
- No. Nick. you can beat him.

256
00:22:11.581 --> 00:22:13.184
Just don't let him
dictate the action.

257
00:22:13.217 --> 00:22:15.686
Stay aggressive.
and go right after him.

258
00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.254
Hey. hey. hey.
who's the coach here?

259
00:22:17.288 --> 00:22:19.223
- Sorry. Coach.
- Alright. Nick. listen.

260
00:22:19.256 --> 00:22:23.661
Listen. I want you to do...
to do exactly what Abi says.

261
00:22:23.694 --> 00:22:26.964
Huh? We only need one more match
win to get us to regionals.

262
00:22:26.998 --> 00:22:30.968
Alright. okay.
huddle up. come on.

263
00:22:31.002 --> 00:22:33.771
Alright. it's Nick. Here we go.

264
00:22:35.572 --> 00:22:37.875
- Alright. one. two. three...
- Nick!

265
00:23:02.733 --> 00:23:04.668
Nick. Nick. you done?

266
00:23:06.636 --> 00:23:09.240
There's a consolation match
coming up in...

267
00:23:09.273 --> 00:23:11.909
Oh. man. I am freezing
my ass off out here.

268
00:23:15.913 --> 00:23:20.317
Alright. I'm going back inside.

269
00:23:20.351 --> 00:23:23.187
If you're not right behind me
I'm gonna tell the officials

270
00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:26.323
that you're forfeiting the
consolation round because you quit.

271
00:23:27.825 --> 00:23:29.193
Are you a quitter. Newell?

272
00:23:38.903 --> 00:23:41.872
Just remember. remember Nick.

273
00:23:41.906 --> 00:23:45.608
fear is only temporary.
regret is forever.

274
00:24:28.352 --> 00:24:30.688
Got 'em.

275
00:24:30.721 --> 00:24:32.756
Dammit.

276
00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:34.425
Oh. you're getting
much better. man.

277
00:24:34.458 --> 00:24:36.660
Yeah.

278
00:24:39.096 --> 00:24:41.765
- Almost. Yeah.
- Almost? How about a rematch?

279
00:24:41.799 --> 00:24:42.933
- Let's go.
- Rematch?

280
00:24:42.967 --> 00:24:44.168
Can we get some more beers

281
00:24:44.201 --> 00:24:46.303
whenever you get a chance.
please? Thank you.

282
00:24:51.041 --> 00:24:54.145
I missed you. man.
It's been a while.

283
00:24:54.178 --> 00:24:55.178
Yeah.

284
00:24:56.313 --> 00:24:58.949
Yeah. man. too long.

285
00:25:01.452 --> 00:25:03.220
Let's not let that happen again.

286
00:25:04.388 --> 00:25:06.690
Deal.

287
00:25:06.724 --> 00:25:08.101
I'm going to empty
the tanks real quick. alright.

288
00:25:08.125 --> 00:25:09.160
Yeah.

289
00:25:13.364 --> 00:25:15.199
- I'm sorry. man.
- What the hell. man?

290
00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:24.074
Are we done here?

291
00:25:25.242 --> 00:25:26.710
Yeah. we're done.

292
00:25:31.882 --> 00:25:34.251
That was crazy. Where the hell
did you learn how to do that?

293
00:25:34.285 --> 00:25:35.486
Yeah. man. I know. I...

294
00:25:35.519 --> 00:25:37.454
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

295
00:25:38.389 --> 00:25:39.690
Check this out.

296
00:26:00.778 --> 00:26:02.146
So this is mixed martial arts?

297
00:26:02.179 --> 00:26:04.014
Yeah. man. it's a combat sport

298
00:26:04.048 --> 00:26:05.883
that combines both
striking and wrestling.

299
00:26:05.916 --> 00:26:08.886
It's growing like crazy
right now.

300
00:26:08.919 --> 00:26:10.788
And you want to know
what the best part is?

301
00:26:11.322 --> 00:26:12.356
What?

302
00:26:12.389 --> 00:26:14.091
We get paid.

303
00:26:18.028 --> 00:26:19.330
That's-that's cool and all. Abi.

304
00:26:19.363 --> 00:26:21.265
We're not MMA fighters.

305
00:26:21.298 --> 00:26:23.867
Yeah. but we're wrestlers.

306
00:26:23.901 --> 00:26:26.237
which is the best foundation
to start with.

307
00:26:28.405 --> 00:26:29.405
Come on.

308
00:26:38.949 --> 00:26:41.051
Hey. you here for the try outs?

309
00:26:41.085 --> 00:26:42.453
Oh. yeah.

310
00:26:42.486 --> 00:26:45.456
- Tryouts?
- Yes. next week.

311
00:26:45.489 --> 00:26:47.400
Several of you will beat
the shit out of each other.

312
00:26:47.424 --> 00:26:48.568
and one of you will be
the winner.

313
00:26:48.592 --> 00:26:51.128
and get $500 and a fight

314
00:26:51.161 --> 00:26:53.530
in next month's
amateur promotion.

315
00:26:55.065 --> 00:26:56.467
Do you want to fill one out?

316
00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.469
Five-hundred bucks right?

317
00:26:58.502 --> 00:27:00.371
If you're the winner. yeah.

318
00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.341
Yeah. give me an application.

319
00:27:04.375 --> 00:27:06.076
- Alright then.
- Thank you.

320
00:27:09.947 --> 00:27:11.915
Good thing you
write with your right hand.

321
00:27:55.225 --> 00:27:56.960
This is what you
want to do to make money?

322
00:27:57.961 --> 00:28:00.931
Hell. yeah. It pays well.

323
00:28:05.436 --> 00:28:08.505
Besides.
these guys are strikers.

324
00:28:08.539 --> 00:28:11.241
You get them to the ground
and they're helpless.

325
00:28:12.509 --> 00:28:13.509
Mm.

326
00:28:19.216 --> 00:28:22.096
How many punches am I gonna have to
take before I get them to the ground?

327
00:28:23.053 --> 00:28:25.856
A few.
but you've got a thick skull.

328
00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.360
You're up.

329
00:28:34.331 --> 00:28:35.966
Show 'em how it's done. man.

330
00:28:44.608 --> 00:28:46.176
Let's go. Abi!

331
00:29:01.959 --> 00:29:03.160
Oh. sh...

332
00:29:14.071 --> 00:29:15.205
Come on. man. come on.

333
00:29:18.242 --> 00:29:19.610
Come on. Abi. lock it in!

334
00:29:21.645 --> 00:29:25.215
Yes! Come on. baby! Hell. yeah!

335
00:29:27.351 --> 00:29:29.553
Okay. next up.

336
00:29:35.092 --> 00:29:36.493
My boy.

337
00:29:36.527 --> 00:29:38.162
That's not bad. man.

338
00:29:38.195 --> 00:29:40.631
Alright. Kick his ass. alright.

339
00:29:40.665 --> 00:29:44.101
- Alright. man.
- Yeah. Go get him.

340
00:29:47.004 --> 00:29:48.605
Alright. guys.
let's keep it clean.

341
00:29:48.639 --> 00:29:51.508
I just want to
see your skills. okay?

342
00:29:51.542 --> 00:29:54.077
Yo. I can't fight this guy.

343
00:29:54.111 --> 00:29:55.747
You know. if I had a dollar

344
00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:57.181
for every asswipe
that's said that.

345
00:29:57.214 --> 00:29:58.525
I wouldn't have to fight
for this 500.

346
00:29:58.549 --> 00:30:00.317
Bro. who are you
calling an asswipe. man?

347
00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:02.386
Okay. you know what.
to compete in this promotion.

348
00:30:02.419 --> 00:30:06.356
you actually need to physically
beat him not with your scary words.

349
00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:09.526
So let's fight. huh?
You guys ready?

350
00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:12.262
It's your funeral. gimp.

351
00:30:14.298 --> 00:30:17.167
Okay. Fight.

352
00:30:25.175 --> 00:30:26.678
Gotta protect yourself. Nick.

353
00:30:42.626 --> 00:30:44.729
Wrestle. Nick. wrestle!
Get him to the ground!

354
00:30:47.264 --> 00:30:48.298
There you go.

355
00:31:02.747 --> 00:31:07.518
Okay. uh. he's technically
asleep now. so nice going.

356
00:31:09.453 --> 00:31:10.587
Yes!

357
00:31:10.621 --> 00:31:12.422
Whoo!

358
00:31:12.456 --> 00:31:14.157
Alright. uh. first of all.

359
00:31:14.191 --> 00:31:16.059
I want to thank all of you
for coming out

360
00:31:16.093 --> 00:31:18.562
and kicking ass the way you did.
Very impressive.

361
00:31:18.595 --> 00:31:20.597
I wish we had more than
one spot quite frankly.

362
00:31:20.631 --> 00:31:24.167
because a few of you really
could be moving on at this point.

363
00:31:24.201 --> 00:31:27.070
But only one of you can.
as promised.

364
00:31:27.104 --> 00:31:30.574
So without further ado.

365
00:31:30.607 --> 00:31:34.378
the winner is Abi Maestre.

366
00:31:35.512 --> 00:31:38.615
Look at this guy.
How about that?

367
00:31:38.649 --> 00:31:40.217
Hey. drinks on me
tonight. fellas.

368
00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:41.318
Alright. but listen up.

369
00:31:41.351 --> 00:31:43.554
you got four weeks
to prepare. okay.

370
00:31:43.587 --> 00:31:46.791
This Matt Bartunek.
he's not to be taken lightly.

371
00:31:46.824 --> 00:31:50.193
He'll rip off your head and show it
to you before you die. you understand?

372
00:31:50.227 --> 00:31:52.195
- Yes. sir.
- Alright. let's hear it for him.

373
00:32:06.143 --> 00:32:08.111
- Alright. alright. alright.
- Whoo!

374
00:32:08.145 --> 00:32:10.314
All you other losers
better beware.

375
00:32:10.347 --> 00:32:13.650
he'll smash you.
and thrash you. Bubba the Bear!

376
00:32:17.154 --> 00:32:18.656
The Bear's in trouble.

377
00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:21.191
Ladies and gentlemen.
we might have a new champion.

378
00:32:21.224 --> 00:32:22.727
Ahh. not so fast.

379
00:32:26.597 --> 00:32:27.832
Come on. man.

380
00:32:30.702 --> 00:32:32.737
I gotta get going. man.

381
00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:34.504
I'm having dinner with my dad.

382
00:32:34.538 --> 00:32:37.374
Your dad. seriously?

383
00:32:38.275 --> 00:32:39.343
Yeah.

384
00:32:40.812 --> 00:32:42.346
I'll fill you in later.

385
00:32:44.481 --> 00:32:45.482
Alright.

386
00:32:58.595 --> 00:33:02.332
Man I. uh...
I wish you were fighting too.

387
00:33:03.868 --> 00:33:08.305
Nah. they picked the best guy.

388
00:33:08.338 --> 00:33:10.708
Besides. man. for the first time
in my life. I...

389
00:33:12.844 --> 00:33:14.812
I feel like I have
some sort of direction.

390
00:33:16.313 --> 00:33:17.682
So thank you for that.

391
00:33:18.615 --> 00:33:20.183
You always have my back.

392
00:33:22.586 --> 00:33:26.289
Of course. man.
you're my brother.

393
00:33:26.891 --> 00:33:28.726
You're my brother.

394
00:33:31.796 --> 00:33:33.230
Now. I'll see you tomorrow.
right?

395
00:33:33.263 --> 00:33:34.297
Yes. sir.

396
00:33:37.001 --> 00:33:40.404
Hey. yo. Nick.
do me a favor. alright?

397
00:33:40.437 --> 00:33:41.538
What's up?

398
00:33:42.506 --> 00:33:43.741
Keep your hands up.

399
00:33:45.475 --> 00:33:46.576
Keep my hands up?

400
00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:48.478
Yeah. yeah?

401
00:34:14.371 --> 00:34:15.371
Need a hand with that?

402
00:34:19.476 --> 00:34:20.912
Is that a joke?

403
00:34:20.945 --> 00:34:23.647
Oh. hell no. I-I didn't
mean that I just was...

404
00:34:23.681 --> 00:34:24.782
I'm kidding. Erroll.

405
00:34:28.953 --> 00:34:31.923
Um... it's okay to call me dad.

406
00:34:31.956 --> 00:34:33.590
Yeah. I know.

407
00:34:35.827 --> 00:34:38.428
Is that why you changed
your last name to Newell?

408
00:34:38.462 --> 00:34:39.563
Are you ashamed of my name?

409
00:34:39.596 --> 00:34:40.732
No.

410
00:34:43.034 --> 00:34:44.601
But Mom was.

411
00:34:47.537 --> 00:34:51.641
Listen. Nick. I don't know what your
mom told you about why I left...

412
00:34:53.077 --> 00:34:55.545
but there is so much more...

413
00:34:55.579 --> 00:34:57.481
She told me that you were
a selfish shit

414
00:34:57.514 --> 00:35:00.017
who freaked out at the idea
of raising a kid with one arm.

415
00:35:01.451 --> 00:35:03.688
That sounds like typical
Stacey bullshit.

416
00:35:03.721 --> 00:35:07.557
Hey. Nick. Nick. Nick.
Come on. come...

417
00:35:07.591 --> 00:35:09.559
I'm sorry. come on. come back.

418
00:35:13.064 --> 00:35:14.564
Come on.

419
00:35:14.598 --> 00:35:16.533
No. you listen to me.

420
00:35:16.566 --> 00:35:18.045
You don't get to
talk to her like that.

421
00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:20.537
You don't get to
speak about her like that.

422
00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:23.440
You weren't there for me
and she was.

423
00:35:23.473 --> 00:35:25.710
You weren't there for me
when I needed you.

424
00:35:27.678 --> 00:35:29.781
She's more of a parent to me
that you would ever be.

425
00:35:32.349 --> 00:35:33.349
I know.

426
00:35:34.919 --> 00:35:36.921
I know.

427
00:35:36.954 --> 00:35:40.725
I let you down. and I'm sorry.

428
00:35:42.126 --> 00:35:44.695
I couldn't get my shit together.

429
00:35:44.729 --> 00:35:50.400
I had some issues. some demons
that I couldn't quite drown.

430
00:35:51.702 --> 00:35:55.372
But. look. I-I'm...
I'm better now.

431
00:35:55.405 --> 00:35:56.674
You know what. just..

432
00:35:59.643 --> 00:36:00.812
Don't worry about it.

433
00:36:03.114 --> 00:36:04.581
Mom and I did just fine.

434
00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:06.850
I know you did.

435
00:36:10.154 --> 00:36:11.989
I noticed
you're wrestling again.

436
00:36:13.057 --> 00:36:14.491
How'd you know that?

437
00:36:17.061 --> 00:36:19.596
Hey. how'd you know I even
wrestled in the first place?

438
00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:23.533
Well. I... I check in.

439
00:36:24.467 --> 00:36:25.467
Always have.

440
00:36:32.542 --> 00:36:33.610
Second chance.

441
00:36:34.411 --> 00:36:35.478
Second chance.

442
00:36:37.815 --> 00:36:38.916
Hey. Mom.

443
00:36:42.653 --> 00:36:43.654
Mom?

444
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:46.657
Mom. what's wrong?

445
00:36:48.159 --> 00:36:49.861
Mom...

446
00:36:50.962 --> 00:36:53.597
Abi was in
a motorcycle accident.

447
00:36:55.967 --> 00:36:57.534
Well. is he okay?

448
00:36:59.136 --> 00:37:01.605
Nick. he died.

449
00:37:03.074 --> 00:37:04.374
What?

450
00:37:05.609 --> 00:37:07.410
What?

451
00:37:07.444 --> 00:37:09.780
- I'm so sorry.
- Abi's dead?

452
00:37:14.085 --> 00:37:15.920
- No.
- Nick...

453
00:37:16.988 --> 00:37:20.725
No. No. Mom. no. no.

454
00:38:17.048 --> 00:38:20.751
Why?! Why?! Why him?!

455
00:38:20.785 --> 00:38:24.889
Why?! Why him?! Why?!

456
00:39:01.624 --> 00:39:02.624
Hey. Nick.

457
00:39:04.729 --> 00:39:06.529
Yeah.

458
00:39:06.563 --> 00:39:07.665
Listen. uh...

459
00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:11.202
I just wanted to say
how sorry I am about Abi.

460
00:39:11.235 --> 00:39:12.870
I know how close you two were.

461
00:39:14.238 --> 00:39:15.272
Yeah.

462
00:39:16.841 --> 00:39:18.608
Yeah. you guys. uh.

463
00:39:18.641 --> 00:39:20.911
you both showed real skill
during the try outs. you know.

464
00:39:22.113 --> 00:39:24.081
I watch you train every day.

465
00:39:25.582 --> 00:39:27.018
Thank you.

466
00:39:27.051 --> 00:39:30.154
Yeah. we still got
that promotional fight...

467
00:39:31.722 --> 00:39:34.125
against Bartunek.
you know. coming up.

468
00:39:37.862 --> 00:39:39.562
How would you feel
about stepping in?

469
00:39:42.266 --> 00:39:44.735
For Abi?

470
00:39:44.769 --> 00:39:47.304
I watch you
train every day with him.

471
00:39:47.338 --> 00:39:48.906
You're ready.

472
00:39:51.608 --> 00:39:54.245
And I'll pay you
the same 500 I promised to him.

473
00:39:56.747 --> 00:39:58.249
The fight's in two days.

474
00:40:01.385 --> 00:40:04.321
Yeah. okay. $1.000 then.

475
00:40:04.355 --> 00:40:06.657
And we got
the championship arena.

476
00:40:11.996 --> 00:40:15.598
Hey. what the hell else
you gonna do on Saturday night?

477
00:40:26.277 --> 00:40:30.181
Hey. you got a nickname?

478
00:40:31.749 --> 00:40:34.051
Um. no.

479
00:40:35.252 --> 00:40:36.954
How about Notorious Nick?

480
00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:40.623
Eh. try it on.

481
00:40:48.432 --> 00:40:49.733
Welcome home.

482
00:40:51.035 --> 00:40:53.737
Wow. Chinese food.

483
00:40:53.771 --> 00:40:55.906
I mean. this is something else.

484
00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:58.242
I got you
your favorite too. here.

485
00:41:02.146 --> 00:41:03.714
You're up to something.

486
00:41:05.783 --> 00:41:06.884
What is this?

487
00:41:12.356 --> 00:41:14.796
There's no way you're not going
to finish nursing school. Mom.

488
00:41:16.694 --> 00:41:18.162
Where did you get
this type of money?

489
00:41:19.363 --> 00:41:21.932
- Where?
- I'm filling in for Abi.

490
00:41:23.467 --> 00:41:26.036
You're fighting?

491
00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:29.073
- Yeah.
- Are you out of your mind?

492
00:41:29.106 --> 00:41:31.151
I mean. who's gonna pay for your
medical bills. Nick. when you get hurt?

493
00:41:31.175 --> 00:41:33.144
We don't have medical insurance.

494
00:41:33.177 --> 00:41:35.179
You're almost a nurse.
right. so...

495
00:41:35.212 --> 00:41:36.814
Very funny.

496
00:41:36.847 --> 00:41:41.185
Mom. I'm gonna be careful.

497
00:41:41.218 --> 00:41:42.820
Okay. I know
how to protect myself.

498
00:41:42.853 --> 00:41:46.190
No. no. this is... this is...
this is crazy.

499
00:41:46.223 --> 00:41:48.692
Look. you've been taking care
of me my entire life.

500
00:41:50.194 --> 00:41:53.230
I want to help. it's my turn.

501
00:41:58.002 --> 00:42:01.205
Well. I guess if you're gonna
fight you better kick some ass.

502
00:42:03.774 --> 00:42:05.743
I mean.
some serious ass kicking.

503
00:42:05.776 --> 00:42:06.977
I will.

504
00:42:09.213 --> 00:42:10.915
Oh. my God.

505
00:42:12.783 --> 00:42:14.084
All for me?

506
00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:24.260
Nick.

507
00:42:26.897 --> 00:42:28.098
Coach.

508
00:42:30.034 --> 00:42:31.769
Long time. no see. What's up?

509
00:42:32.369 --> 00:42:33.737
Um...

510
00:42:35.773 --> 00:42:38.142
Look. I have...
I have a fight coming up.

511
00:42:39.977 --> 00:42:42.246
I was wondering if
you would work my corner.

512
00:42:46.317 --> 00:42:48.018
I don't work with quitters. kid.

513
00:42:52.056 --> 00:42:54.225
- Coach. this-this fight...
- I can't do it.

514
00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:57.962
My time's too valuable.

515
00:42:59.997 --> 00:43:01.232
Good luck.

516
00:43:13.277 --> 00:43:17.414

To the center. gentlemen.

525
00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:59.456
Now. remember.
protect yourself at all times.

526
00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:02.326

Nick.

531
00:44:40.297 --> 00:44:41.865
Wrestle. dammit.

532
00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:15.399
Tap! Tap!

533
00:45:15.432 --> 00:45:18.302
That's it. that's it.

534
00:45:38.055 --> 00:45:39.556
How is he?

535
00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:41.325
He's a very lucky man.

536
00:45:41.358 --> 00:45:44.061
If you start getting headaches
or feeling nauseous.

537
00:45:44.094 --> 00:45:46.397
you need to see
a doctor immediately.

538
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:49.099
- Understand?
- He understands.

539
00:46:00.077 --> 00:46:02.613
I didn't know.

540
00:46:02.646 --> 00:46:05.182
- Know what?
- I didn't know how brutal this sport is.

541
00:46:05.215 --> 00:46:08.285
I can't watch you
take another beatdown like that.

542
00:46:08.318 --> 00:46:10.154
What does that mean?

543
00:46:10.187 --> 00:46:12.089
It means that you
cannot fight again

544
00:46:12.122 --> 00:46:13.624
or you're gonna
get seriously hurt.

545
00:46:14.525 --> 00:46:16.093
I'll be fine. I promise.

546
00:46:16.126 --> 00:46:18.228
You cannot promise me
that about this.

547
00:46:18.262 --> 00:46:20.340
You can't promise me that you're
not gonna end up in a hospital.

548
00:46:20.364 --> 00:46:22.199
brain dead
with tubes keeping you alive.

549
00:46:22.232 --> 00:46:24.635
- You're being overly dramatic.
- Am I?

550
00:46:24.669 --> 00:46:27.237
You always told me that I could
be anything I put my mind to.

551
00:46:27.271 --> 00:46:28.515
That doesn't mean
that you're superhuman.

552
00:46:28.539 --> 00:46:31.041
and that you're not
gonna get seriously hurt!

553
00:46:31.074 --> 00:46:34.411
You need to quit
before that ends up happening.

554
00:46:37.214 --> 00:46:38.659
I can't believe
you're telling me to quit.

555
00:46:38.683 --> 00:46:40.317
Listen to me.

556
00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:42.619
Listen to me.

557
00:46:42.654 --> 00:46:45.766
I have always told you that I would be honest
with you no matter how much it hurts you.

558
00:46:45.790 --> 00:46:50.227
and you cannot make a career
of this sport Nick. You cannot.

559
00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:52.129
I don't need to hear that
from you right now.

560
00:46:54.364 --> 00:46:55.999
I've heard that shit
my entire life.

561
00:46:56.033 --> 00:46:57.669
I don't need to
hear it from you!

562
00:46:58.569 --> 00:47:00.137
Well. you just did.

563
00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:28.031
Coach.

564
00:47:31.736 --> 00:47:33.537
I thought I might find you here.

565
00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:45.349
I saw your fight
the other night.

566
00:47:47.484 --> 00:47:48.686
You shoulda won.

567
00:47:50.755 --> 00:47:52.589
Instead. you fought stupid
with anger

568
00:47:52.623 --> 00:47:56.193
and let your emotions
get the better of you.

569
00:48:04.501 --> 00:48:06.136
Anything else?

570
00:48:06.169 --> 00:48:08.071
You went toe-to-toe
with a puncher.

571
00:48:09.306 --> 00:48:11.843
Played right into his strength

572
00:48:11.876 --> 00:48:15.312
instead of exploiting his
weakness. which was wrestling.

573
00:48:19.616 --> 00:48:21.753
Did I do anything right?

574
00:48:21.786 --> 00:48:26.758
Yeah.
you showed unbelievable heart.

575
00:48:29.126 --> 00:48:33.230
That can't be learned.
You either have it or you don't.

576
00:48:33.263 --> 00:48:35.599
You have it in spades. kid.

577
00:48:40.404 --> 00:48:43.173
I should have never quit on you.

578
00:48:43.206 --> 00:48:44.508
You know. you didn't quit on me.

579
00:48:44.541 --> 00:48:47.110
you quit on yourself.
you quit on the team.

580
00:48:47.144 --> 00:48:49.246
I didn't think
I was good enough.

581
00:48:49.279 --> 00:48:51.214
What makes you think
you're good enough now?

582
00:48:52.784 --> 00:48:54.618
Because Abi thought so.

583
00:48:58.823 --> 00:49:00.357
It's okay to grieve. kid.

584
00:49:02.827 --> 00:49:06.764
Grieving leaves scars that
each wears as a badge of honor.

585
00:49:08.165 --> 00:49:10.868
It means you love someone.

586
00:49:10.902 --> 00:49:13.270
And take it from me.
the mourning will never stop.

587
00:49:13.303 --> 00:49:15.372
And you should never want it to.

588
00:49:15.405 --> 00:49:17.374
I wanted to win
the fight for him.

589
00:49:19.610 --> 00:49:22.179
You don't honor Abi
by winning a fight.

590
00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:25.248
Win the fights for yourself.

591
00:49:32.657 --> 00:49:36.761
You're gonna have to listen to what I
say. and trust me.

592
00:49:39.196 --> 00:49:40.832
You saying
you're going to train me?

593
00:49:50.675 --> 00:49:51.709
Coach...

594
00:49:54.846 --> 00:49:56.480
I need to do this.

595
00:49:58.950 --> 00:50:01.652
You know I don't know shit
about mixed martial arts.

596
00:50:07.692 --> 00:50:09.559
Does it look like I do?

597
00:50:12.496 --> 00:50:17.267
No. no. We're going to learn.

598
00:50:45.529 --> 00:50:47.497
Alright. all the way down.

599
00:50:47.531 --> 00:50:48.833
All the way down.

600
00:50:51.035 --> 00:50:52.302
Alright. that's good.

601
00:50:52.335 --> 00:50:54.371
Come on. come on. come on!
One more.

602
00:50:54.404 --> 00:50:58.642
Push. push. You can do it.

603
00:50:58.676 --> 00:51:00.610
Oh. your new
sparring partner's here.

604
00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:22.033
He's pretty square
on his opponent.

605
00:51:22.066 --> 00:51:24.267
See this guy? This guy. too.
is dominating. right?

606
00:51:24.301 --> 00:51:27.270
Look how this guy backs up...
then he sneaks by.

607
00:51:27.304 --> 00:51:29.506
But now he-he seems like he's...

608
00:51:29.539 --> 00:51:31.641
- Certainly being the aggressor.
- Right.

609
00:51:46.958 --> 00:51:48.059
Alright. Nick.

610
00:51:48.092 --> 00:51:49.026
Nick. we made it. man.

611
00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:51.963
We made it.
We are here. fight number one.

612
00:51:51.996 --> 00:51:54.832
Alright. prove you belong.
Prove you belong!

613
00:52:00.738 --> 00:52:01.973
Fighter. are you ready?

614
00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:04.440
Fighter. are you ready?

615
00:52:05.342 --> 00:52:06.343
Fight.

616
00:52:19.090 --> 00:52:20.524
Get out of there.
get out of there!

617
00:52:33.436 --> 00:52:34.806
You got it. You got him.
Hold him!

618
00:52:42.379 --> 00:52:44.882
Oh. oh! Whoa! Whoo!

619
00:52:50.620 --> 00:52:52.657
KO! KO. KO. KO!

620
00:53:05.602 --> 00:53:06.771
Jab! Give me a pop up.

621
00:53:06.804 --> 00:53:07.905
Give me a pop up. There.

622
00:53:31.494 --> 00:53:32.529
There. Nick...

623
00:53:46.844 --> 00:53:47.844
Alright. here we go.

624
00:53:51.514 --> 00:53:52.950
He doesn't look that tough.

625
00:54:22.179 --> 00:54:25.683
Yeah. yeah! Hell. yeah! Whoo!

626
00:54:26.784 --> 00:54:28.551
I guess looks can be deceiving.

627
00:54:34.926 --> 00:54:36.426
Rich. hey.

628
00:54:37.128 --> 00:54:38.128
It's Nick.

629
00:54:39.196 --> 00:54:41.666
Hey. Rich.

630
00:54:41.699 --> 00:54:43.968
I just wanted to. uh.
congratulate you on your win.

631
00:54:44.001 --> 00:54:45.435
Hey. thanks. man.

632
00:54:50.507 --> 00:54:52.109
It's gonna be
a real honor to fight you.

633
00:54:54.644 --> 00:54:57.447
Fight me? Fat chance.

634
00:54:58.749 --> 00:55:00.017
What do you mean?

635
00:55:00.051 --> 00:55:02.619
Nick's ranked number one.
he's your mandatory.

636
00:55:03.988 --> 00:55:05.756
I don't give a shit.

637
00:55:05.790 --> 00:55:08.225
I'm a legitimate fighter.
not a publicity stunt.

638
00:55:08.259 --> 00:55:10.161
Who the hell are you
calling a publicity stunt?

639
00:55:10.194 --> 00:55:12.997
I can't even
take you serious. little boy.

640
00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:15.632
Look. how do we benefit
in either case?

641
00:55:15.666 --> 00:55:17.068
- It's a lose-lose.
- Right.

642
00:55:17.101 --> 00:55:20.637
If we beat you. then Rich
beat a one-handed fighter.

643
00:55:20.671 --> 00:55:22.139
And if he loses...

644
00:55:22.173 --> 00:55:24.641
then he lost
to a one-handed fighter.

645
00:55:24.675 --> 00:55:26.010
Pretty much.

646
00:55:26.043 --> 00:55:27.878
Look. I earned my way here.

647
00:55:27.912 --> 00:55:29.512
Sure. you did.

648
00:55:29.546 --> 00:55:31.248
The hell
is that supposed to mean?

649
00:55:31.282 --> 00:55:33.550
C'mon. man. everybody knows
that promoters

650
00:55:33.583 --> 00:55:36.519
use you to draw big crowds
and match you up with bums.

651
00:55:36.553 --> 00:55:37.553
It's no secret.

652
00:55:39.589 --> 00:55:41.591
Okay. if you're so sure
then take the fight.

653
00:55:44.128 --> 00:55:45.696
You don't seem to get it do you.

654
00:55:46.563 --> 00:55:49.266
You're a sideshow.
a marketing ploy.

655
00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:51.035
You're giving
real fighters a bad name.

656
00:55:51.068 --> 00:55:53.146
- This sideshow's about to beat your ass!
- Hey. Whoa. whoa. whoa!

657
00:55:53.170 --> 00:55:54.739
Alright.
we're not taking the bait.

658
00:55:54.772 --> 00:55:55.782
and we are not taking the fight.

659
00:55:55.806 --> 00:55:58.075
Now you guys need to
get out of here right now.

660
00:55:58.109 --> 00:55:59.143
Now!

661
00:55:59.176 --> 00:56:00.745
This isn't over.

662
00:56:00.778 --> 00:56:02.880
We're going to take this
to the XFC!

663
00:56:02.913 --> 00:56:04.048
Yeah. yeah. good luck.

664
00:56:04.081 --> 00:56:05.648
Come on. let's go!
Come on. Nick.

665
00:56:05.683 --> 00:56:07.685
Go! Get the hell out of here.

666
00:56:08.352 --> 00:56:10.553
Nice meeting you.

667
00:56:18.696 --> 00:56:19.764
Hey. guy.

668
00:56:19.797 --> 00:56:22.199
Hey. uh. I got some bad news.

669
00:56:22.233 --> 00:56:25.269
Uh. XFC has
a new sanctioning board

670
00:56:25.302 --> 00:56:27.204
and after looking at
our application

671
00:56:27.238 --> 00:56:31.075
they've. uh. announced they're
not going to sanction a fight.

672
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:33.677
What?

673
00:56:33.711 --> 00:56:36.847
Yeah. yeah. they're denying
your right to fight.

674
00:56:40.251 --> 00:56:42.820
No. no. They can't...
they can't do that.

675
00:56:42.853 --> 00:56:44.131
- I know.
- Look. I earned my way here.

676
00:56:44.155 --> 00:56:45.332
- You did.
- They cannot do that.

677
00:56:45.356 --> 00:56:46.257
You did. I know.

678
00:56:46.290 --> 00:56:48.659
Let's-let's step over here
and talk about it.

679
00:56:56.633 --> 00:56:58.135
I mean. what the hell
is the point

680
00:56:58.169 --> 00:56:59.713
of having rankings if they're
not going to honor them?

681
00:56:59.737 --> 00:57:01.739
I understand. okay.
Let's-let's stay calm

682
00:57:01.772 --> 00:57:03.274
and try to think this through.

683
00:57:03.307 --> 00:57:05.743
Nick's a contender
for the title. this is his shot.

684
00:57:05.776 --> 00:57:07.978
Of course it is. alright.
no one's doubting that.

685
00:57:08.012 --> 00:57:09.880
it's just this is
a new sanctioning board

686
00:57:09.914 --> 00:57:13.084
and they've been told
a different story.

687
00:57:13.117 --> 00:57:15.853
They just think the XFC has been
using Nick as a publicity stunt.

688
00:57:15.886 --> 00:57:18.222
- Man. this is such bullshit.
- Of course it is.

689
00:57:18.255 --> 00:57:22.326
You beat legitimate guys:
Maze. Butler. you whipped them.

690
00:57:22.359 --> 00:57:25.696
Okay. then why?
Why can't I fight?

691
00:57:25.729 --> 00:57:28.065
They're just afraid
that if these rumors go public

692
00:57:28.099 --> 00:57:31.135
and you get hurt during a fight.
then their credibility is shot.

693
00:57:31.168 --> 00:57:33.938
not to mention
lawsuits up the ass.

694
00:57:33.971 --> 00:57:35.673
What can we do?

695
00:57:35.706 --> 00:57:37.775
Well. you can petition
the board. ask for a hearing.

696
00:57:37.808 --> 00:57:39.043
Stand up for yourself.

697
00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:46.851
Gentlemen.
welcome to our XFC board.

698
00:57:46.884 --> 00:57:47.985
Please. have a seat.

699
00:57:52.022 --> 00:57:55.893
We. uh...
we have sworn testimony

700
00:57:55.926 --> 00:57:59.897
from Nick's last three opponents
that those fights were legit.

701
00:57:59.930 --> 00:58:02.199
Nick won them fair and square

702
00:58:02.233 --> 00:58:05.002
no matter what you might
have heard. Here.

703
00:58:06.971 --> 00:58:08.281
What incentive
would these fighters

704
00:58:08.305 --> 00:58:09.940
have to say
anything differently?

705
00:58:09.974 --> 00:58:11.408
It would ruin their reputations.

706
00:58:11.442 --> 00:58:13.077
Wait. so you think
they're lying?

707
00:58:13.110 --> 00:58:15.880
Mr. Newell.
wait your turn. please.

708
00:58:15.913 --> 00:58:18.315
No. I'm not gonna wait my turn.

709
00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:20.751
You guys
are messing with my career.

710
00:58:20.784 --> 00:58:22.028
You're taking away
my livelihood.

711
00:58:22.052 --> 00:58:23.020
I am the one
that has to live with

712
00:58:23.053 --> 00:58:25.890
the consequences
of your decisions. not you.

713
00:58:27.124 --> 00:58:28.359
I want to be heard.

714
00:58:30.794 --> 00:58:31.829
Go ahead. Mr. Newell.

715
00:58:35.833 --> 00:58:37.701
Hi.

716
00:58:39.336 --> 00:58:41.939
Nick. I. um...

717
00:58:41.972 --> 00:58:44.808
Hi gentlemen. I'm Stacey Newell.
Nick's mother.

718
00:58:44.842 --> 00:58:46.810
Nice to meet you. Mrs. Newell.

719
00:58:47.511 --> 00:58:49.146
Ms. Newell.

720
00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:51.048
Sorry. Ms. Please continue.

721
00:58:52.316 --> 00:58:54.018
Robert M. Hensel once said

722
00:58:54.051 --> 00:58:55.395
that we the ones
who are challenged

723
00:58:55.419 --> 00:58:58.923
need to be heard. to be seen.

724
00:58:58.956 --> 00:59:03.994
Not as a disability. but as a person
who has and will continue to grow.

725
00:59:04.028 --> 00:59:10.334
To be seen not as a handicap.
but as a well intact human being.

726
00:59:11.902 --> 00:59:14.872
Ma'am. I'm not sure
we understand what you mean.

727
00:59:14.905 --> 00:59:17.007
It means that if he had
two good hands

728
00:59:17.041 --> 00:59:19.343
would we be
even having this hearing?

729
00:59:19.376 --> 00:59:21.879
The first priority
is the safety of our fighters.

730
00:59:21.912 --> 00:59:24.215
I appreciate that. I do.

731
00:59:24.248 --> 00:59:28.385
And no one is more concerned
about Nick's health than I am.

732
00:59:28.419 --> 00:59:30.354
I must admit.
there's a small part of me

733
00:59:30.387 --> 00:59:32.823
that wants you
to deny him his license.

734
00:59:33.991 --> 00:59:35.960
but that is a mother speaking.

735
00:59:35.993 --> 00:59:39.396
And I forget that he
is no longer a little boy

736
00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:43.133
struggling with a disability.
but a man who has overcome it.

737
00:59:44.902 --> 00:59:48.138
Nick has the right to live
the life he wants to live

738
00:59:48.172 --> 00:59:50.374
and to have the career
he wants to pursue.

739
00:59:50.407 --> 00:59:53.877
Especially since he's proven
that he can handle it.

740
00:59:56.547 --> 01:00:00.150
We appreciate your input and it will
be noted. Thank you. Ms. Newell.

741
01:00:00.184 --> 01:00:05.289
Excuse me... you might be surprised
how many supporters Nick has.

742
01:00:07.091 --> 01:00:09.059
And how much press
a one-armed fighter could get

743
01:00:09.093 --> 01:00:12.896
if he's being denied his dreams and
told that he can't fight anymore.

744
01:00:12.930 --> 01:00:17.067
I'm sure that there are countless news
outlets. social media. TV. newspapers.

745
01:00:17.101 --> 01:00:18.969
that would really love to
hear this story.

746
01:00:20.237 --> 01:00:22.006
Let's not make threats now.

747
01:00:22.039 --> 01:00:24.908
I'm not making threats.
I'm making promises.

748
01:00:26.243 --> 01:00:28.078
Thank you. Ms. Newell.

749
01:00:28.112 --> 01:00:30.247
we will take this
under advisement.

750
01:00:31.849 --> 01:00:33.550
Let's go. Let's go.

751
01:00:43.927 --> 01:00:45.896
Hey. Vito. how are you doing?

752
01:00:45.929 --> 01:00:47.464
Alex.

753
01:00:47.498 --> 01:00:49.042
It's good to see you.
it's been a while.

754
01:00:49.066 --> 01:00:52.102
- Good to see you. too.
- Yeah. can we talk?

755
01:00:53.370 --> 01:00:55.205
Chris. could you
give us a moment?

756
01:00:57.074 --> 01:01:00.110
Thanks. man.
It's about Nick Newell.

757
01:01:00.144 --> 01:01:02.446
I figured that.

758
01:01:02.479 --> 01:01:05.382
You need to know
that this kid's the real deal.

759
01:01:05.416 --> 01:01:10.220
Every fighter that he's taken on
has been legit. and he has not lost.

760
01:01:10.254 --> 01:01:11.522
I don't know if he's gonna.

761
01:01:12.890 --> 01:01:15.993
Alright? He won't let you down.

762
01:01:16.026 --> 01:01:18.829
I'm not sure he's gonna
disappoint anybody ever.

763
01:01:20.898 --> 01:01:26.537
Look. I just... I need you
to do me this favor. that's all.

764
01:01:26.570 --> 01:01:30.274
I've never asked you
for anything. you know that.

765
01:01:30.307 --> 01:01:33.010
- Ever.
- Alex. I appreciate it.

766
01:01:33.043 --> 01:01:36.347
I really do.
Let me see what I can do.

767
01:01:37.548 --> 01:01:38.548
Alright.

768
01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:42.619
- Hey. Alex?
- Yeah?

769
01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:44.656
Do me a favor.

770
01:01:44.689 --> 01:01:46.957
have your people
keep a lid on this

771
01:01:46.990 --> 01:01:48.392
until we sort things out.

772
01:01:51.261 --> 01:01:52.896
I'll see what I can do.

773
01:02:10.614 --> 01:02:14.284
Okay. You guys good?

774
01:02:14.952 --> 01:02:16.053
Yeah.

775
01:02:16.086 --> 01:02:17.588
Okay.

776
01:02:17.621 --> 01:02:18.922
Alright. what are they...

777
01:02:18.956 --> 01:02:20.033
- Still haven't called.
- No? Okay.

778
01:02:20.057 --> 01:02:20.725
That's okay.

779
01:02:20.759 --> 01:02:22.694
They get busy you know. it's...

780
01:02:22.727 --> 01:02:25.028
- They're gonna call. What time is it?
- Yeah.

781
01:02:25.062 --> 01:02:27.598
It's a little after 2:00.

782
01:02:27.631 --> 01:02:28.631
Nick.

783
01:02:30.234 --> 01:02:31.268
Pick it up.

784
01:02:36.306 --> 01:02:37.441
Hello?

785
01:02:39.643 --> 01:02:41.445
Yeah. yeah. this is him.

786
01:02:48.285 --> 01:02:49.353
I understand.

787
01:02:52.589 --> 01:02:54.925
And that's your final decision?

788
01:03:00.130 --> 01:03:01.198
Okay.

789
01:03:03.133 --> 01:03:08.005
Alright. yeah. Okay. You too.

790
01:03:14.746 --> 01:03:15.746
Well?

791
01:03:18.015 --> 01:03:19.383
I'm gonna fight.

792
01:03:19.416 --> 01:03:22.619
Oh. you got me.

793
01:03:25.222 --> 01:03:26.523
You got me.

794
01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:33.464
- Oh. my gosh.
- We've got to get to work right away. hm?

795
01:03:33.497 --> 01:03:35.399
- Yeah.
- Look familiar?

796
01:03:39.603 --> 01:03:41.238
Go say something.

797
01:03:51.816 --> 01:03:52.983
Excuse me.

798
01:03:54.651 --> 01:03:56.386
You're Notorious Nick Newell!

799
01:03:58.222 --> 01:04:00.324
Yeah. so I've been told.

800
01:04:00.357 --> 01:04:01.358
What's your name?

801
01:04:01.391 --> 01:04:02.794
I'm Eli.

802
01:04:02.827 --> 01:04:05.195
Eli.
Well. nice to meet you. Eli.

803
01:04:05.229 --> 01:04:06.396
Nice to meet you. too.

804
01:04:07.531 --> 01:04:09.667
Look. Eli...

805
01:04:11.335 --> 01:04:12.670
I'm fighting
for the championship.

806
01:04:12.704 --> 01:04:16.006
- Wow.
- Yeah. it's pretty cool. right?

807
01:04:17.341 --> 01:04:20.177
- Wanna come to a fight?
- Mom can I?

808
01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:21.278
Yes.

809
01:04:21.311 --> 01:04:22.479
Awesome.

810
01:04:23.614 --> 01:04:25.315
You do any fighting yourself?

811
01:04:25.349 --> 01:04:28.051
- Nah. I'm a baseball pitcher.
- Okay. cool.

812
01:04:28.085 --> 01:04:29.586
But I'm not a very good one.

813
01:04:30.621 --> 01:04:31.723
Yeah? Why is that?

814
01:04:31.756 --> 01:04:33.725
Is something
wrong with your eyes?

815
01:04:38.796 --> 01:04:40.564
Do you love baseball. Eli?

816
01:04:41.398 --> 01:04:43.100
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

817
01:04:43.835 --> 01:04:45.202
Then stick with it.

818
01:04:46.838 --> 01:04:50.340
You know. someone once told me
that if you love something

819
01:04:50.374 --> 01:04:51.618
you may have to work
twice as hard

820
01:04:51.642 --> 01:04:54.746
as everyone else.
but it's worth it.

821
01:04:56.613 --> 01:04:57.614
Don't you ever give up.

822
01:04:59.449 --> 01:05:01.184
I believe in you.

823
01:05:02.152 --> 01:05:03.186
Alright?

824
01:05:04.154 --> 01:05:05.289
Alright.

825
01:05:05.322 --> 01:05:06.432
It was nice to meet you guys.

826
01:05:06.456 --> 01:05:07.500
I'll see you at the fight. okay.

827
01:05:07.524 --> 01:05:08.764
- I'll see you there.
- Alright.

828
01:05:15.499 --> 01:05:18.502
Yeah! Up. up. up. up.

829
01:05:18.535 --> 01:05:19.837
Pull. pull. pull.

830
01:05:19.871 --> 01:05:21.381
Do you want it?
You've got to take it. man.

831
01:05:21.405 --> 01:05:22.372
You've got to take it.

832
01:05:22.406 --> 01:05:24.107
Stay active.

833
01:05:24.141 --> 01:05:25.642
Keep working. keep working.

834
01:05:26.811 --> 01:05:28.211
Grind!

835
01:05:30.414 --> 01:05:33.785
Yep. yep. yep. Yep.

836
01:05:33.818 --> 01:05:36.119
Alright. Alright. alright.
settle. settle.

837
01:05:37.387 --> 01:05:38.522
No worries.

838
01:05:38.555 --> 01:05:40.825
Just stay calm. breathe easy.

839
01:05:40.858 --> 01:05:44.561
What's our transition?
Our transition.

840
01:05:44.595 --> 01:05:46.898
We need to transition
into omoplata. Alright?

841
01:05:46.931 --> 01:05:48.298
Yeah.

842
01:05:48.332 --> 01:05:49.572
Okay. alright. let me show you.

843
01:05:51.435 --> 01:05:52.770
Alright. come here.

844
01:05:54.806 --> 01:05:57.174
Alright. so you've got him
in a triangle.

845
01:05:57.207 --> 01:05:59.376
- Yeah.
- Huh. lock your arm back here.

846
01:05:59.409 --> 01:06:03.347
Alright. so if you can't finish
the triangle past your left leg.

847
01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:06.216
over his head like this.
Sit up in omoplata.

848
01:06:06.249 --> 01:06:08.418
- Huh? Now he's done.
- Just crank right there?

849
01:06:08.452 --> 01:06:10.855
Yup. right here. You got it?

850
01:06:10.888 --> 01:06:12.556
Questions. comments. concerns?

851
01:06:12.589 --> 01:06:13.825
No.

852
01:06:13.858 --> 01:06:15.192
Your turn.

853
01:06:19.563 --> 01:06:21.666
- Okay. there's triangle.
- Yup. triangle.

854
01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:25.670
- So when he goes to defend it...
- Uh-huh.

855
01:06:26.738 --> 01:06:28.305
Trap the arm.

856
01:06:29.707 --> 01:06:31.308
Yes. that's it.

857
01:06:31.341 --> 01:06:33.377
Yep. you got it. great job.

858
01:06:33.410 --> 01:06:36.580
You got it.
That's good. Nice job.

859
01:07:36.808 --> 01:07:39.342
Elbow. hook. elbow. hook.

860
01:07:39.376 --> 01:07:41.311
Elbow. hook. Elbow. hook.

861
01:07:41.344 --> 01:07:43.881
Alright. Okay. that's it.

862
01:07:44.749 --> 01:07:45.749
Alright. take a seat.

863
01:07:46.884 --> 01:07:48.452
Alright. listen to me.

864
01:07:49.586 --> 01:07:51.354
You need to have
patience tonight.

865
01:07:51.388 --> 01:07:52.622
Believe in the game plan.

866
01:07:52.657 --> 01:07:54.391
Don't blow all your energy

867
01:07:54.424 --> 01:07:56.027
in one big adrenaline dump.

868
01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:57.829
Trust that you did
all you could do

869
01:07:57.862 --> 01:08:00.430
to get ready
for this fight. Huh?

870
01:08:00.464 --> 01:08:03.467
And I want you to know.
that no matter what happens tonight.

871
01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:04.769
I couldn't be prouder of you.

872
01:08:06.738 --> 01:08:08.505
Questions. comments. concerns?

873
01:08:11.441 --> 01:08:12.777
Thank you. Coach.

874
01:08:14.611 --> 01:08:16.246
Thank you for everything.

875
01:08:33.396 --> 01:08:36.968
Whoo! Yeah. yeah. yeah!
I'm the champ!

876
01:08:37.001 --> 01:08:38.635
I'm the champ. it's my time!

877
01:08:38.669 --> 01:08:41.973
Let's go! Whoo! Yeah!
Hell. yeah!

878
01:08:56.620 --> 01:08:58.288
I fear no man.

879
01:09:01.692 --> 01:09:03.460
No beast or evil.

880
01:09:18.776 --> 01:09:20.044
It's time. Nick.

881
01:09:37.128 --> 01:09:39.429
It's a big night
at the XFC arena.

882
01:09:39.462 --> 01:09:42.033
as Nick Newell facing off
against Rich Reynolds

883
01:09:42.066 --> 01:09:43.768
for the lightweight
championship belt.

884
01:09:43.801 --> 01:09:45.045
Yeah. this should be
a great one.

885
01:09:45.069 --> 01:09:49.040
Newell is talented.
but Reynolds is an animal.

886
01:09:49.073 --> 01:09:52.143
He might be a little bit too polished
and experienced though for Newell.

887
01:09:52.176 --> 01:09:54.979
Well. we'll see. it's a championship
match that means five rounds.

888
01:09:55.012 --> 01:09:56.948
Yeah. and Newell
is a big underdog in this one.

889
01:09:56.981 --> 01:09:59.884
Most experts think that he won't
even make it out of that first round.

890
01:10:23.107 --> 01:10:24.541
Hey. it's time.

891
01:10:55.907 --> 01:10:57.675
Mom. Mom. there he is!

892
01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:16.961
Tape.

893
01:11:22.166 --> 01:11:25.836
Cup. Mouthpiece.
Extra mouthpiece.

894
01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:33.910
You understand the rules?

895
01:11:34.979 --> 01:11:36.113
Have a good fight.

896
01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:15.920
Ladies and gentlemen.

897
01:12:15.953 --> 01:12:21.558
welcome to the XFC
World Championship Event.

898
01:12:21.591 --> 01:12:25.628
And now the moment
you have all been waiting for.

899
01:12:25.663 --> 01:12:30.600
With a professional record
of eight wins. no losses.

900
01:12:30.633 --> 01:12:35.773
the Notorious Nick Newell.

901
01:12:40.211 --> 01:12:42.612
And from the other corner.

902
01:12:42.645 --> 01:12:46.050
the XFC's Lightweight Champion
of the World.

903
01:12:46.083 --> 01:12:49.820
with an undefeated record
of 16-0.

904
01:12:49.854 --> 01:12:53.691
it's Rich "It's a Wrap"
Reynolds.

905
01:12:59.864 --> 01:13:01.165
- You ready?
- Yeah.

906
01:13:01.198 --> 01:13:02.632
Have a good fight.

907
01:13:03.701 --> 01:13:04.701
You ready?

908
01:13:05.269 --> 01:13:06.670
Have a good fight.

909
01:13:22.787 --> 01:13:25.322
Okay. guys. let's have
a good clean fight.

910
01:13:25.356 --> 01:13:27.992
Tap gloves. and go back
to your corners.

911
01:13:28.025 --> 01:13:30.261
Let me show you what
a real fighter's about. chump.

912
01:13:31.128 --> 01:13:32.163
Hey.

913
01:13:32.196 --> 01:13:34.597
Oh. no love loss
between these two.

914
01:13:34.631 --> 01:13:36.734
The crowd is really
looking forward to this fight.

915
01:13:36.767 --> 01:13:38.278
I just hope Newell
can hang in there long enough

916
01:13:38.302 --> 01:13:39.582
to give them
their money's worth.

917
01:14:07.298 --> 01:14:09.300
Remember. patience. Nick.

918
01:14:09.333 --> 01:14:11.235
Stay clear of his right hand.
Wear him out!

919
01:14:16.373 --> 01:14:17.607
You ready?

920
01:14:18.275 --> 01:14:19.910
You ready?

921
01:14:19.944 --> 01:14:21.644
Fight.

922
01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:38.429
Wow. Newell in trouble
almost immediately.

923
01:14:38.462 --> 01:14:40.865
One clean blow from Reynolds.
and this could be the end.

924
01:14:48.372 --> 01:14:50.808
Don't panic!
Remember what we practiced!

925
01:15:37.855 --> 01:15:40.224
Break it up. break it up. Break it up.

926
01:15:45.763 --> 01:15:48.866
Nick. Nick. Nick.

927
01:15:48.899 --> 01:15:51.268
Play our game.
don't play his game.

928
01:15:51.302 --> 01:15:52.870
You've got to
stay out of his reach

929
01:15:52.903 --> 01:15:54.004
until he throws a punch.

930
01:15:54.038 --> 01:15:55.839
then go in
and hit him with a combo.

931
01:15:55.873 --> 01:15:57.875
Alright?
If he takes you down again.

932
01:15:57.908 --> 01:15:58.842
stay off your back!

933
01:15:58.876 --> 01:16:00.411
You're exerting too much energy.

934
01:16:00.444 --> 01:16:02.746
Newell looks spent
after just one round.

935
01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:05.091
Yeah. the champ is putting on
tremendous pressure on Newell.

936
01:16:05.115 --> 01:16:06.875
I'd be surprised to see
the end of round two.

937
01:16:22.933 --> 01:16:24.333
Ooh. a hard right
to Reynolds' head.

938
01:16:27.438 --> 01:16:29.873
Another right
to the champ's head!

939
01:16:41.952 --> 01:16:43.454
The champ is down!

940
01:16:43.487 --> 01:16:44.922
Take him down!

941
01:16:44.955 --> 01:16:46.090
Get off the ground. Richie!

942
01:16:47.958 --> 01:16:49.193
Come on. Nick!

943
01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:13.250
It's over now. Reynolds has him
in his patented leg lock.

944
01:17:13.284 --> 01:17:16.220
Newell is gonna have to tap here or
he is in for some serious damage.

945
01:17:16.253 --> 01:17:17.921
Get out of it. Nick.
get out of it!

946
01:17:20.190 --> 01:17:21.558
You can do it. Nick!

947
01:17:21.592 --> 01:17:23.160
He's going to roll. Rich!

948
01:17:28.265 --> 01:17:30.968
Come on. come on. come on.
Hang tight. Nick. come on.

949
01:17:31.001 --> 01:17:33.137
The round's almost over.
Come on. hang on!

950
01:17:35.472 --> 01:17:37.107
Fifteen seconds!

951
01:17:41.645 --> 01:17:43.814
You got him.
You got him. just hold on.

952
01:17:54.892 --> 01:17:58.862
Newell is limping badly.
he's got 60 seconds to recover.

953
01:17:58.896 --> 01:18:00.336
Not sure that's gonna be
enough time.

954
01:18:10.641 --> 01:18:12.276
How's the leg. son?

955
01:18:14.111 --> 01:18:15.412
I'm good to go.

956
01:18:17.147 --> 01:18:18.515
Does that hurt?

957
01:18:20.150 --> 01:18:21.285
No.

958
01:18:23.153 --> 01:18:26.190
Alright. Good luck.

959
01:18:33.063 --> 01:18:35.165
I didn't come this far to lose.

960
01:18:39.203 --> 01:18:41.472
Just tell me if you can't go on.

961
01:18:43.708 --> 01:18:46.543
- I can win this.
- I believe you.

962
01:18:46.577 --> 01:18:49.113
Nick. Nick. Nick. Nick...

963
01:18:49.146 --> 01:18:53.050
Hear that? They believe you. too.

964
01:19:05.996 --> 01:19:08.098
Well. we know who the crowd
is rooting for.

965
01:19:08.132 --> 01:19:10.577
Yeah. Newell had a hard time
getting sanctioned for this fight.

966
01:19:10.601 --> 01:19:15.105
but he's shown today that he is a
true warrior. no one can deny that.

967
01:19:15.139 --> 01:19:17.819
Yeah. no doubt. but I'm not sure
how much longer this can go on for.

968
01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:51.308
Wrestle. Nick. wrestle!

969
01:19:52.276 --> 01:19:54.378
Wrestle. goddammit!

970
01:20:08.258 --> 01:20:11.228
My God. Newell has Reynolds
in a rear naked choke!

971
01:20:11.261 --> 01:20:12.963
That came out of nowhere!

972
01:20:14.565 --> 01:20:16.099
Come on. Nick. you can do it!

973
01:20:18.435 --> 01:20:21.138
Hold on. Hold on!

974
01:20:23.173 --> 01:20:25.008
You've got him. Nick!

975
01:20:25.042 --> 01:20:27.144
Come on. come on. choke him out.
Nick. come on!

976
01:20:27.177 --> 01:20:30.113
He may have this.
Reynolds can't break the hold.

977
01:20:34.051 --> 01:20:35.753
He's done. you're done.

978
01:20:35.787 --> 01:20:39.022
That's it! The fight is over!

979
01:20:40.257 --> 01:20:42.292
Yeah!

980
01:20:43.060 --> 01:20:43.795
Ah!

981
01:20:43.828 --> 01:20:45.529
Yeah!

982
01:20:45.562 --> 01:20:48.632
Oh! Whoo!

983
01:20:51.736 --> 01:20:53.303
This is unbelievable!

984
01:20:53.337 --> 01:20:56.640
Newell won.
he actually won the fight!

985
01:21:04.816 --> 01:21:09.286
You've just witnessed one of the
greatest upsets in sports history!

986
01:21:09.854 --> 01:21:11.455
Oh. my God!

987
01:21:11.488 --> 01:21:14.358
Oh. my God! Oh. my...

988
01:21:14.391 --> 01:21:16.761
That's my son! That's my boy!

989
01:21:20.597 --> 01:21:22.533
Yes. yes. yes!

990
01:21:25.302 --> 01:21:29.439
Unbelievable!
There are no words to describe this!

991
01:21:33.610 --> 01:21:35.078
Mom. can I go?

992
01:21:36.346 --> 01:21:40.050
You did it! You did it!
Yes! Whoo!

993
01:22:01.138 --> 01:22:04.508
We did it. You did it. it's yours.
It's yours.

994
01:22:15.152 --> 01:22:16.253
Ladies and gentlemen.

995
01:22:16.286 --> 01:22:18.255
your new XFC champion.

996
01:22:18.288 --> 01:22:20.591
Notorious Nick Newell.

997
01:22:43.715 --> 01:22:45.415
Abi. we did it.

998
01:23:00.197 --> 01:23:03.367
I don't think my story is any
more special than anyone else.

999
01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:05.737
You know. um. the truth is.

1000
01:23:05.770 --> 01:23:08.405
<i>you know. I am a one-handed guy
and I had these problems.</i>

1001
01:23:08.438 --> 01:23:10.340
<i>and I had these obstacles.
and I overcame them</i>

1002
01:23:10.374 --> 01:23:12.744
to become something and make
something out of myself.

1003
01:23:12.777 --> 01:23:15.512
<i>His just... his internal drive.</i>

1004
01:23:15.545 --> 01:23:17.414
<i>He wanted to be the best.</i>

1005
01:23:17.447 --> 01:23:19.650
he wanted to be...
He wanted to improve.

1006
01:23:19.684 --> 01:23:21.351
He fell in love with the sport.

1007
01:23:21.385 --> 01:23:22.930
Uh. I can remember
when he called me and said.

1008
01:23:22.954 --> 01:23:23.888
"Oh. I started training MMA."

1009
01:23:23.921 --> 01:23:25.699
and I was like "What the...
What are you doing?"

1010
01:23:25.723 --> 01:23:28.291
It all actually happened.
It's not like he made it up.

1011
01:23:28.325 --> 01:23:30.360
You know. and if anybody
thinks it's fake.

1012
01:23:30.394 --> 01:23:32.462
they can come to Connecticut
and come to his gym

1013
01:23:32.496 --> 01:23:34.231
and look on the wall
and see the belt.

1014
01:23:34.264 --> 01:23:35.967
It is main event time.

1015
01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:40.337
"Notorious" Nick Newell versus
"It's a Wrap" Eric Reynolds.

1016
01:23:40.370 --> 01:23:44.341
We are set for five rounds.
The championship at 155 pounds.

1017
01:23:44.374 --> 01:23:48.913
Southpaw start. as always.
for Notorious Nick Newell.

1018
01:23:48.946 --> 01:23:50.948
He starts off
with some solid leg kicks. Pat.

1019
01:23:50.982 --> 01:23:53.417
Newell said he worked a
lot on his kicks for this fight.

1020
01:23:54.886 --> 01:23:56.353
He'll try to muscle his way

1021
01:23:56.386 --> 01:23:58.355
and get Eric Reynolds
onto his back.

1022
01:23:58.388 --> 01:24:00.490
There's a high left round kick
from Nick Newell.

1023
01:24:00.524 --> 01:24:02.727
Overhand right from Newell
and Reynolds fires back

1024
01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:04.327
with a right hand of his own.

1025
01:24:04.361 --> 01:24:05.863
High left round kick
from Newell.

1026
01:24:08.365 --> 01:24:10.968
Newell tries to
catch the kicking leg.

1027
01:24:11.002 --> 01:24:12.770
He's trying to lock onto
his arm there.

1028
01:24:12.804 --> 01:24:14.782
He's got it locked.
let's see what he does with it.

1029
01:24:14.806 --> 01:24:16.373
Come on. Nick!

1030
01:24:16.406 --> 01:24:18.442
Oh. suplex!

1031
01:24:18.475 --> 01:24:20.912
Oh. it's a back suplex there
from Nick Newell.

1032
01:24:20.945 --> 01:24:23.447
This is where Nick Newell
is so good.

1033
01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:25.582
There's the arm
under the chin now.

1034
01:24:25.615 --> 01:24:28.585
The hooks are in
for Notorious Nick Newell.

1035
01:24:28.618 --> 01:24:30.788
Is he on his way
to a world championship?

1036
01:24:30.822 --> 01:24:32.389
This is where it's an advantage

1037
01:24:32.422 --> 01:24:33.791
because he can't get
hand control

1038
01:24:33.825 --> 01:24:35.325
on that shorter arm.

1039
01:24:35.358 --> 01:24:36.798
He's pulling down
on the gloved hand.

1040
01:24:36.828 --> 01:24:38.261
but that's already trapped.

1041
01:24:38.295 --> 01:24:40.530
Reynolds in trouble!

1042
01:24:40.564 --> 01:24:41.875
- Reynolds taps out!
- That's it. that's it!

1043
01:24:41.899 --> 01:24:44.634
It's goodnight. Irene!

1044
01:24:44.669 --> 01:24:47.872
The fairy tale comes true!

1045
01:24:47.905 --> 01:24:50.808
Winner blue.
tap out. by rear naked choke.

1046
01:24:50.842 --> 01:24:55.278
Nick Newell is the XFC champion!

1047
01:24:55.312 --> 01:24:58.548
A standing ovation
here in Nashville!

1048
01:24:58.582 --> 01:24:59.784
Nice fight. brother.

1049
01:24:59.817 --> 01:25:02.019
That kid is happy.

1050
01:25:02.053 --> 01:25:04.689
Nashville
