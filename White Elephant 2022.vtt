3
00:02:58.485 --> 00:03:00.419
Happy birthday. baby.

4
00:03:19.441 --> 00:03:21.671
Sorry I'm late. My apologies.

5
00:03:21.773 --> 00:03:22.903
No worries.
I won't keep you long.

6
00:03:23.005 --> 00:03:25.741
I have a deposition
to prepare.

7
00:03:25.843 --> 00:03:29.778
and I understand that
today was your wife's birthday.

8
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.582
It is. yeah.

9
00:03:31.684 --> 00:03:35.421
I do not enjoy pulling you away
from your remembrances.

10
00:03:35.523 --> 00:03:36.950
but I'm sure you understand

11
00:03:37.052 --> 00:03:41.020
that some conversations
are best had in person.

12
00:03:41.122 --> 00:03:46.432
Now. you're sure your associate
is prepared to do this thing?

13
00:03:46.534 --> 00:03:47.994
He is.

14
00:03:48.096 --> 00:03:50.865
Because the results
need to be definitive.

15
00:03:50.967 --> 00:03:52.031
It will be.

16
00:03:52.133 --> 00:03:54.341
And where Luis is concerned.

17
00:03:54.443 --> 00:03:56.508
our intentions are clear?

18
00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.939
-Crystal.
-- Good.

19
00:03:59.041 --> 00:04:00.842
This deal with the Russians
is too important

20
00:04:00.944 --> 00:04:03.416
to let Luis Velasquez
get in the way.

21
00:04:03.518 --> 00:04:06.452
Arnold will need to make haste.

22
00:04:06.554 --> 00:04:09.785
Because they want a cash deposit
in my office

23
00:04:09.887 --> 00:04:11.721
by the close of business today.

24
00:04:11.823 --> 00:04:13.591
Not a problem.

25
00:04:13.693 --> 00:04:14.790
- Very well.

26
00:04:14.892 --> 00:04:16.924
Onwards and upwards.

27
00:04:17.026 --> 00:04:19.465
- Mm.

28
00:04:19.567 --> 00:04:21.027
Have a good one.

29
00:05:13.422 --> 00:05:14.850
- Hey. Carlito.

30
00:05:16.722 --> 00:05:19.019
Excuse the search.
I got. uh. trust issues.

31
00:05:19.121 --> 00:05:20.493
I don't even trust myself.

32
00:05:20.595 --> 00:05:21.923
You understand.

33
00:05:22.025 --> 00:05:24.090
I understand.

34
00:05:30.901 --> 00:05:34.771
Yo.<i> corrier.</i> bring him
some. uh -- some. uh. tequila.

35
00:05:34.873 --> 00:05:36.410
<i>-Sí?</i>
-No.

36
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.843
I know you're strictly business.

37
00:05:43.882 --> 00:05:45.716
Let me bless you
with information

38
00:05:45.818 --> 00:05:48.752
that might save your life.

39
00:05:48.854 --> 00:05:50.754
They're never gonna
trust you here.

40
00:05:50.856 --> 00:05:52.822
To people like Arnold Solomon.

41
00:05:52.924 --> 00:05:54.758
you're just
another fucking beaner.

42
00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.760
Just when you need them
the most.

43
00:05:56.862 --> 00:05:59.796
they'll throw you under the bus
because they don't like you.

44
00:05:59.898 --> 00:06:01.028
<i>¿Entiendes?</i>

45
00:06:05.705 --> 00:06:07.067
I'm Luis Velasquez.

46
00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:09.707
I'm loved and respected
worldwide.

47
00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:11.071
And you can be. too.

48
00:06:11.173 --> 00:06:14.514
You see. in light of
the Russian threat.

49
00:06:14.616 --> 00:06:17.880
Mr. Solomon thought that
having us as your partner

50
00:06:17.982 --> 00:06:20.080
would be a form of insurance.

51
00:06:23.922 --> 00:06:25.888
Yo. this guy kills me. man.

52
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.087
Are you serious?

53
00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:28.726
You take those
"Soul Train" shoes

54
00:06:28.828 --> 00:06:30.662
and get the fuck out of here.

55
00:06:30.764 --> 00:06:31.894
You stay your side
of the tracks.

56
00:06:31.996 --> 00:06:33.830
I'll stay on mine.
You understand?

57
00:06:33.932 --> 00:06:36.866
-End of negotiations. then?
-Go.

58
00:06:36.968 --> 00:06:38.571
"End of negotiations."

59
00:06:38.673 --> 00:06:40.507
What the fuck is wrong with you?

60
00:06:40.609 --> 00:06:43.708
I should have fucking Hector
just kick you in the ass.

61
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:45.611
I don't need you
or Arnold fucking Solomon

62
00:06:45.713 --> 00:06:47.173
to deal with the Russians.

63
00:06:47.275 --> 00:06:49.582
What if...

64
00:06:49.684 --> 00:06:51.980
What if Mr. Solomon
raised his offer?

65
00:06:52.082 --> 00:06:53.212
- Let me think about that.

66
00:06:53.314 --> 00:06:55.214
Fuck Solomon.

67
00:07:01.288 --> 00:07:02.826
- Hey!

68
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.936
Carlito.

69
00:07:14.038 --> 00:07:16.202
Ah! Oh!

70
00:07:19.207 --> 00:07:21.878
- That was a hell
of a game yesterday.

71
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.242
I mean. winning isn't
everything.

72
00:07:23.344 --> 00:07:25.849
but it beats the hell
out of coming in second.

73
00:07:27.754 --> 00:07:30.051
You don't care for football
where you come from. do you?

74
00:07:30.153 --> 00:07:33.725
Nah. you're all hockey crazy.
I bet.

75
00:07:33.827 --> 00:07:35.826
You sure this is it?

76
00:07:35.928 --> 00:07:37.597
Looks like
my accountant's building.

77
00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:39.764
My CI has wagered
a parole hearing on it.

78
00:07:39.866 --> 00:07:40.864
We're good.

79
00:07:40.966 --> 00:07:44.802
So. doing anything nice tonight?

80
00:07:44.904 --> 00:07:48.003
I'm impressed. Detective.

81
00:07:48.105 --> 00:07:49.972
It was an alert on my phone.

82
00:07:50.074 --> 00:07:52.007
Happy birthday.

83
00:07:52.109 --> 00:07:54.108
Thank you.

84
00:07:57.851 --> 00:07:59.784
Can't scare it away
with a hangover. Flynn.

85
00:07:59.886 --> 00:08:01.522
I'm fine.

86
00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:07.759
Who the hell is the slick suit?

87
00:08:07.861 --> 00:08:12.830
SS neck tattoo on a distinctly
non-Aryan-looking customer.

88
00:08:12.932 --> 00:08:14.898
Marine snipers use that tattoo.

89
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.262
They're not supposed to.

90
00:08:16.364 --> 00:08:19.672
but Scout Snipers tend
to make their own rules.

91
00:08:19.774 --> 00:08:20.838
Really?

92
00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:24.105
Sounds like someone else I know.

93
00:08:24.207 --> 00:08:26.008
Bite me. Koschek.

94
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:27.911
In your dreams. tough guy.

95
00:08:48.098 --> 00:08:49.801
- Look at him.

96
00:08:49.903 --> 00:08:52.034
I should run his plate.

97
00:08:59.373 --> 00:09:00.812
Fuck.

98
00:09:08.316 --> 00:09:10.822
Smile. little piggy.

99
00:09:10.924 --> 00:09:12.890
He fucking made us.

100
00:09:12.992 --> 00:09:14.188
I'm bringing him in.

101
00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.846
- Look at my nose.

102
00:09:38.116 --> 00:09:40.082
Everything checks out.
Detective.

103
00:09:40.184 --> 00:09:41.281
You're free to go.

104
00:09:41.383 --> 00:09:42.348
Thanks.

105
00:09:44.759 --> 00:09:46.825
Neighbors didn't see anything.

106
00:09:46.927 --> 00:09:51.192
Nothing to go on other than
what we saw or didn't see.

107
00:09:51.294 --> 00:09:52.193
We were stupid.

108
00:09:52.295 --> 00:09:55.163
Should have tailed him.

109
00:09:55.265 --> 00:09:57.165
Oh. geez.

110
00:09:57.332 --> 00:10:00.971
-- Oh. Jesus.
-Yeah.

111
00:10:01.073 --> 00:10:02.742
This is some crazy shit.
Koschek.

112
00:10:02.844 --> 00:10:03.974
Hell of a day.

113
00:10:04.076 --> 00:10:05.679
Like Bourbon Street
after Mardi Gras.

114
00:10:05.781 --> 00:10:07.142
- Yeah. well.
the party's over.

115
00:10:07.244 --> 00:10:09.078
Me and Daley are taking over.

116
00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.344
Captain wants you two
to go home.

117
00:10:11.446 --> 00:10:12.785
What?

118
00:10:12.887 --> 00:10:14.985
That's fucking bullshit.
This is our case.

119
00:10:15.087 --> 00:10:16.822
-Whoa. whoa. whoa. down. girl.
-- Dial it back. Flynn.

120
00:10:16.924 --> 00:10:18.285
What did you just say?

121
00:10:18.387 --> 00:10:21.354
Hey. we're just following
Captain's orders. alright?

122
00:10:21.456 --> 00:10:23.092
But we had eyes on the suspect.

123
00:10:23.194 --> 00:10:25.699
And then you let him get away
and all hell broke loose.

124
00:10:25.801 --> 00:10:27.030
Okay?

125
00:10:29.463 --> 00:10:31.705
It's not worth it.

126
00:10:31.807 --> 00:10:33.201
Screw you. Lanier.

127
00:10:41.915 --> 00:10:46.346

134

Hey.

135
00:11:43.912 --> 00:11:45.339
He's ready to see y'all now.

136
00:12:00.555 --> 00:12:02.389
The case goes to Follett.

137
00:12:02.491 --> 00:12:04.523
He'll know what to do.

138
00:12:07.198 --> 00:12:11.167
Carlo handled Velasquez
like an ice-cold pro.

139
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:12.432
He didn't want to negotiate.

140
00:12:12.534 --> 00:12:14.808
so your message
has been delivered.

141
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:16.469
Well. you can't say
I didn't try.

142
00:12:18.914 --> 00:12:20.979
- Tell him.

143
00:12:22.247 --> 00:12:25.313
Two possible witnesses.

144
00:12:25.415 --> 00:12:26.985
They were cops.

145
00:12:27.087 --> 00:12:29.922
Can they tie the hit to you?

146
00:12:30.024 --> 00:12:31.352
Or you to me?

147
00:12:31.454 --> 00:12:34.190
No. they were probably
staking out Velasquez.

148
00:12:34.292 --> 00:12:35.994
I mean. pure coincidence.

149
00:12:36.096 --> 00:12:37.358
- This is your fault.

150
00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.899
-I know.
-You should have been there.

151
00:12:40.001 --> 00:12:41.461
- He'll fix this.

152
00:12:41.563 --> 00:12:45.135
In many ways. Carlo is
better at this stuff than I am.

153
00:12:45.237 --> 00:12:47.841
- This is your mess.
You clean it up.

154
00:12:47.943 --> 00:12:50.041
You got 48 hours.

155
00:12:50.143 --> 00:12:51.911
- Consider it done. sir.

156
00:12:55.379 --> 00:12:57.081
You better.

157
00:12:57.183 --> 00:12:58.313
We need addresses.

158
00:12:58.415 --> 00:12:59.985
Right.

159
00:13:00.087 --> 00:13:02.383
Yeah. I called my department
contact on the way here.

160
00:13:02.485 --> 00:13:04.825
I'm just waiting for him
to crack open their files.

161
00:13:04.927 --> 00:13:06.519
Then we're good.

162
00:13:10.657 --> 00:13:12.360
I got a picture
of their license plate.

163
00:13:12.462 --> 00:13:15.561
so it should be a done deal
in no time.

164
00:13:16.003 --> 00:13:18.135
- Good. good.

165
00:13:18.237 --> 00:13:20.104
I got to get this shit
over to Follett.

166
00:13:20.206 --> 00:13:21.534
Then I'll help you finish up.

167
00:13:45.362 --> 00:13:46.867
I think the Russians
will be happy

168
00:13:46.969 --> 00:13:48.297
with the Mexican out of the way.

169
00:13:50.631 --> 00:13:52.466
Very well. Erica.

170
00:13:52.568 --> 00:13:56.206
With the successful conclusion
of this deal.

171
00:13:56.308 --> 00:14:00.474
Arnold is going to become
an extraordinarily powerful man.

172
00:14:00.576 --> 00:14:02.443
Thank you.

173
00:14:02.545 --> 00:14:04.610
Real estate's
never been my thing.

174
00:14:04.712 --> 00:14:06.282
Yeah. too bad.

175
00:14:06.384 --> 00:14:08.350
Velasquez should have known
don't go along with him.

176
00:14:08.452 --> 00:14:11.650
Do you know much about
the ancient Greeks. Gabe?

177
00:14:14.358 --> 00:14:17.161
Well. they valued
their liberty highly.

178
00:14:17.263 --> 00:14:21.033
The Greeks encouraged a kind of
self-reliant individualism.

179
00:14:21.135 --> 00:14:25.532
There were no laws to speak of.
so police weren't necessary.

180
00:14:25.634 --> 00:14:27.974
Sounds like my kind of place.

181
00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:30.636
But the ancient Greeks
drew a line in the sand

182
00:14:30.738 --> 00:14:33.045
when it came
to stealing or robbery.

183
00:14:33.147 --> 00:14:36.081
They did not like
their cattle being stolen

184
00:14:36.183 --> 00:14:39.216
and they did not like
their homes being broken into.

185
00:14:39.318 --> 00:14:44.155
But with no police.
how would they find the culprit?

186
00:14:44.257 --> 00:14:50.260
Actually. they had various
methods to determine guilt.

187
00:14:50.362 --> 00:14:53.428
One of them involved
rounding up 12 suspects.

188
00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:57.003
And a judge would give
each of those suspects

189
00:14:57.105 --> 00:14:59.500
a stick 6 inches long.

190
00:14:59.602 --> 00:15:02.943
but he would tell them
that the thief's stick

191
00:15:03.045 --> 00:15:07.046
would grow an extra inch
by the next morning.

192
00:15:07.148 --> 00:15:10.511
Invariably. the guilty party
would chew off

193
00:15:10.613 --> 00:15:14.251
one inch of his stick.
and then the next morning.

194
00:15:14.353 --> 00:15:16.154
he would be there holding

195
00:15:16.256 --> 00:15:19.652
a 5-inch admission of guilt
stick in his hand.

196
00:15:19.754 --> 00:15:23.689
The point is.
for the 30-something years

197
00:15:23.791 --> 00:15:26.296
that I've been
a defense attorney.

198
00:15:26.398 --> 00:15:29.596
I have learned
one irrefutable truth.

199
00:15:29.698 --> 00:15:34.535
and that is criminals
are their own worst enemy.

200
00:15:34.637 --> 00:15:37.406
Can't say I disagree with you.

201
00:15:37.508 --> 00:15:40.706
Well. listen.
I appreciate the delivery.

202
00:15:40.808 --> 00:15:44.677
And this deal with Vlad is gonna
make everyone a lot of money.

203
00:15:44.779 --> 00:15:46.217
Arnold seems to think so.

204
00:15:46.319 --> 00:15:47.988
You don't?

205
00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:51.057
It really doesn't matter
what I think.

206
00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:52.520
Listen.

207
00:15:52.622 --> 00:15:56.029
Arnold trusts you. and trust
is a valuable commodity.

208
00:15:56.131 --> 00:15:57.426
Mm.

209
00:15:57.528 --> 00:16:00.429
He trusts you to protect him
on the street.

210
00:16:00.531 --> 00:16:03.102
and he trusts me to
look after his legal

211
00:16:03.204 --> 00:16:05.005
and financial interests.

212
00:16:05.107 --> 00:16:08.470
In that respect. we're alike.

213
00:16:08.572 --> 00:16:10.373
We've known each other
for a few years now.

214
00:16:10.475 --> 00:16:13.112
right. Mr. Follett?

215
00:16:13.214 --> 00:16:16.742
You've been very kind to me.
and I appreciate that.

216
00:16:16.844 --> 00:16:19.118
But...

217
00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.647
we are nothing alike.

218
00:16:27.524 --> 00:16:28.787
You're reaching.

219
00:16:31.363 --> 00:16:34.199
Come on. now.

220
00:16:36.269 --> 00:16:37.400
Breathe.

221
00:16:37.502 --> 00:16:39.501
-Breathe.

222
00:16:44.376 --> 00:16:47.476
You can't keep
going on like this.

223
00:16:47.578 --> 00:16:50.182
The anger's gonna eat away at
you until there's nothing left.

224
00:16:50.284 --> 00:16:52.052
-- I know.
-- In Afghanistan.

225
00:16:52.154 --> 00:16:54.516
we both lived through
some really bad things.

226
00:16:54.618 --> 00:16:57.618
But you were a cold professional
back in the sandbox.

227
00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.389
You still are
when your head's on straight.

228
00:16:59.491 --> 00:17:03.195
But you seem determined
not to want to get any better.

229
00:17:03.297 --> 00:17:05.560
Think I should go to
some overpaid shrink

230
00:17:05.662 --> 00:17:08.497
and spill my guts?

231
00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:10.136
Couldn't hurt.

232
00:17:10.238 --> 00:17:12.600
At the very least.
you might save your career.

233
00:17:12.702 --> 00:17:15.702
I already know
what's wrong with me.

234
00:17:15.804 --> 00:17:18.507
Every time I meet someone.
I automatically think about

235
00:17:18.609 --> 00:17:21.378
the best and most efficient
way to kill them.

236
00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:24.183
I can't switch it off anymore.

237
00:17:24.285 --> 00:17:26.284
- We've all been
where you're at.

238
00:17:26.386 --> 00:17:29.584
You just got to learn
to leave the outside outside.

239
00:17:33.359 --> 00:17:35.425
I got a class.

240
00:17:35.527 --> 00:17:39.330
You need anything.
you know where to find me.

241
00:17:39.432 --> 00:17:41.596
Yo. guys.
There you go. There you go.

242
00:17:52.246 --> 00:17:55.610
That's the guy --
Detective Lance Koscheck. 52.

243
00:17:55.712 --> 00:17:56.809
Past his prime.

244
00:17:56.911 --> 00:17:59.185
Look at him.
What a sad fucking life.

245
00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:02.551
No family. orders takeout.
eats it alone.

246
00:18:02.653 --> 00:18:05.158
My inside guy said
that he and his partner

247
00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.160
got booted off the case
this morning. so...

248
00:18:07.855 --> 00:18:09.558
Let's get her done.

249
00:18:48.467 --> 00:18:50.269
-Okay.

250
00:18:57.806 --> 00:18:59.344
Hey. brother.

251
00:18:59.446 --> 00:19:02.512
I'm sorry to disturb you.
but I'm the distraction.

252
00:19:02.614 --> 00:19:04.943
What the fuck are you
talking about. asshole?

253
00:19:05.045 --> 00:19:06.219

Half truths aren't lies.

272
00:20:12.948 --> 00:20:14.716
You keep telling yourself that.

273
00:20:18.326 --> 00:20:19.820
I admire you. you know.

274
00:20:19.922 --> 00:20:22.295

275
00:20:23.397 --> 00:20:24.726
I like it there.

One day. I'll probably
have to stay longer.

277
00:20:29.931 --> 00:20:32.404
Ever wish we could have
done things differently?

278
00:20:36.806 --> 00:20:38.575
What's it matter now?

279
00:20:45.012 --> 00:20:47.848
How long have I been training
you to be my replacement?

280
00:20:49.082 --> 00:20:51.324
Two wonderful months.

281
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:54.723
Don't let Arnold shake you.
okay?

282
00:20:54.825 --> 00:20:56.659
When I go. just act like me.

283
00:20:56.761 --> 00:20:58.331
In time. he'll trust you.

284
00:20:58.433 --> 00:20:59.431
I hope.

285
00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:03.963
I really want the respect that
comes with this job. you know?

286
00:21:05.736 --> 00:21:07.505
What's the fucking point?

287
00:21:11.578 --> 00:21:12.774
What about the other witness?

288
00:21:12.876 --> 00:21:13.940
Don't worry about it.

289
00:21:14.042 --> 00:21:15.414
It's my mess.
I'll clean it up.

290
00:21:15.516 --> 00:21:16.745
You sure about this?

291
00:21:16.847 --> 00:21:19.550
You know how important this is
to Arnold.

292
00:21:19.652 --> 00:21:22.718
- I got a few hitters in
mind. so we'll take care of it.

293
00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:25.556
You should go home.
It's Alex's day.

294
00:21:25.658 --> 00:21:27.855
Yeah.
Look. I appreciate that.

295
00:21:29.056 --> 00:21:33.861
By the way. what you get
from this job. it ain't respect.

296
00:21:35.865 --> 00:21:37.535
It's fear.

297
00:21:37.637 --> 00:21:39.372
It's always fear.

298
00:21:40.067 --> 00:21:41.099
Remember that.

299
00:23:40.924 --> 00:23:43.122

00:28:24.339 --> 00:28:26.779
Fuck.

318
00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.400
- Yeah. What's up?

319
00:28:54.502 --> 00:28:56.908
- We have
a situation here.

320
00:28:57.010 --> 00:29:00.406
-Ay-yi-yi.
-The three guys I took are dead.

321
00:29:01.178 --> 00:29:03.409
-She's alive.
-Are you serious?

322
00:29:03.511 --> 00:29:07.281
I know. I know.
It's fuckin' shit.

323
00:29:07.383 --> 00:29:10.922
We fucked up.

324
00:29:11.221 --> 00:29:13.254
Okay. I'll call Arnold.

325
00:29:32.341 --> 00:29:34.440
Arnold will see you now.

326
00:29:39.414 --> 00:29:41.480
Stay. He don't want to see you.

327
00:29:52.933 --> 00:29:54.867
Are you fucking kidding me?

328
00:29:54.969 --> 00:29:56.363
- Morning. sir.

329
00:29:56.465 --> 00:29:59.872
You think I need to hear
this shit from the Russian?

330
00:29:59.974 --> 00:30:02.941
Sorry. It's being taken care of.

331
00:30:03.043 --> 00:30:04.844
- Put a bullet
in this bitch's head.

332
00:30:04.946 --> 00:30:06.472
Or I'll put one in yours.

333
00:30:06.574 --> 00:30:10.608
Like I said.
it's being taken care of.

334
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:14.018
And I think you should rethink
those last few words.

335
00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:18.121
They're insulting to both of us.

336
00:30:18.223 --> 00:30:20.255
Yeah. Alright. I'm sorry.

337
00:30:20.357 --> 00:30:22.092
You know my mouth.

338
00:30:22.194 --> 00:30:24.325
Just get rid of the cop.

339
00:30:24.427 --> 00:30:26.899
It'll be done.

340
00:30:27.001 --> 00:30:28.494
No worries.

341
00:30:31.532 --> 00:30:33.301
You have my word.

342
00:30:43.148 --> 00:30:44.917
Later.

343
00:30:45.612 --> 00:30:47.447
Let's get out of here.

344
00:31:09.108 --> 00:31:10.910
Jesus Christ!

345
00:31:11.012 --> 00:31:12.340
Scared the crap
out of me. Flynn.

346
00:31:12.442 --> 00:31:15.178
-How are you?
-How are you?

347
00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.675
Tell me what you know about
the Velasquez hit yesterday.

348
00:31:17.777 --> 00:31:19.446
- Forget Velasquez.
Tell me where you been?

349
00:31:19.548 --> 00:31:22.251
We found machine guns.
three very deceased John Does.

350
00:31:22.353 --> 00:31:24.319
and a stack of spent brass
at your house.

351
00:31:24.421 --> 00:31:28.092
-Three John Does?
-Yeah. Three.

352
00:31:28.194 --> 00:31:29.654
One on the lawn looked like
he'd been put through

353
00:31:29.756 --> 00:31:31.062
a meat grinder.

354
00:31:31.164 --> 00:31:33.262
No dental records. no prints.

355
00:31:33.364 --> 00:31:36.034
Guy on the lawn was Lanier.

356
00:31:36.136 --> 00:31:37.134
Oh. bullshit.

357
00:31:37.236 --> 00:31:39.466
- It was him.

358
00:31:39.568 --> 00:31:41.237
Did you know?

359
00:31:43.406 --> 00:31:45.208
-No. no. fuck no. Vanessa.
-Did you know?

360
00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:47.309
-Of course not.
-You're his partner.

361
00:31:47.411 --> 00:31:49.080
You're fucking in on this. too.

362
00:31:49.182 --> 00:31:51.643
Yeah. I'm his partner.
but I'm not married to the guy.

363
00:31:51.745 --> 00:31:53.513
If he's dirty.
it's got nothing to do with me.

364
00:31:53.615 --> 00:31:57.517
They had my home address. Daley.

365
00:31:57.619 --> 00:32:00.388
I didn't know. I swear.

366
00:32:01.424 --> 00:32:04.128
Has anyone heard from Koschek?

367
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:05.525
No.

368
00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:10.266
Look. you need to come in.
Alright?

369
00:32:10.368 --> 00:32:12.400
Captain's pitching a shit fit
this morning.

370
00:32:12.502 --> 00:32:14.138
She's about to issue
a BOLO for you.

371
00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.074
I think I'm better out here
for now.

372
00:32:16.176 --> 00:32:17.702
You're crazy. now. Look...

373
00:32:17.804 --> 00:32:20.342
we'll just go in together.

374
00:32:20.444 --> 00:32:22.179
We'll just ride right over
to the precinct.

375
00:32:22.281 --> 00:32:24.214
Listen. you got to find Koschek.

376
00:32:24.316 --> 00:32:26.150
Put him in a safe house.

377
00:32:26.252 --> 00:32:27.481
If this guy came for me.

378
00:32:27.583 --> 00:32:29.384
he's probably gunning
for Koschek. too.

379
00:32:29.486 --> 00:32:31.551
He killed Velasquez. now he's
coming for the witnesses.

380
00:32:31.653 --> 00:32:34.686
Then you definitely
need to come in.

381
00:32:35.656 --> 00:32:37.227
I got to go. Daley.

382
00:32:37.329 --> 00:32:39.097
Where you going. Vanessa?

383
00:32:39.199 --> 00:32:40.758
You know it isn't safe for me.

384
00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:43.365
What do you mean it's not --
Vanessa!

385
00:33:07.688 --> 00:33:09.490
Yeah?

386
00:33:09.592 --> 00:33:12.229
You finally decide to return
my call. you fucking asshole.

387
00:33:12.331 --> 00:33:16.101
Did you kill Lanier?
Did you kill my partner?

388
00:33:16.203 --> 00:33:17.465
- Excuse me?

389
00:33:17.567 --> 00:33:22.041
No. no. no. no.
I ask. and you answer.

390
00:33:22.143 --> 00:33:23.735
Get it?

391
00:33:23.837 --> 00:33:25.143
Where is she?

392
00:33:25.245 --> 00:33:27.376
She's on the run.

393
00:33:27.478 --> 00:33:29.279
Now. listen.

394
00:33:29.381 --> 00:33:30.808
This whole plan of yours
is getting good cops killed.

395
00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:33.613
You're going to make me cry.

396
00:33:33.715 --> 00:33:35.219
Listen. I want out!

397
00:33:35.321 --> 00:33:36.583
- There's no out here.
You want out?

398
00:33:36.685 --> 00:33:38.321
You go buy yourself
a fucking razor blade

399
00:33:38.423 --> 00:33:39.685
and cut your fat fucking wrist.

400
00:33:39.787 --> 00:33:42.259
you dirty cop.

401
00:33:42.361 --> 00:33:45.229
I hear nothing.

402
00:33:45.331 --> 00:33:47.198
So you find her.

403
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:49.596
Get me an address.

404
00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:53.402
Or I'll pay you a visit.

405
00:34:01.346 --> 00:34:03.247
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

406
00:34:06.186 --> 00:34:08.582
We definitely
underestimated her.

407
00:34:08.684 --> 00:34:10.518
She's well trained.

408
00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:13.587
Daley's sending me
her file. actually.

409
00:34:13.689 --> 00:34:16.359
He's another loose end.
you know?

410
00:34:23.533 --> 00:34:27.172
He's good with computers.
He's smart.

411
00:34:27.274 --> 00:34:29.141
Best thing of all.
he's scared of me.

412
00:34:29.243 --> 00:34:30.505
-Mm.
-I'm serious.

413
00:34:30.607 --> 00:34:33.508
He's terrified.
He'll do anything I say.

414
00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:35.213
For now.

415
00:34:35.315 --> 00:34:36.247
As soon as he ceases
to be an asset.

416
00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:39.184
he's a ghost. so...

417
00:34:39.286 --> 00:34:41.483
By the way. we need someone
to clone Flynn's phone

418
00:34:41.585 --> 00:34:43.848
so we can trace her
when she answers.

419
00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:45.289
You got someone?

420
00:34:45.391 --> 00:34:47.819
I don't. but Arnold does.

421
00:34:47.921 --> 00:34:50.756
I'll give him a call.

422
00:34:50.858 --> 00:34:52.593
-Miss.
-Alright.

423
00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:01.563
Hello?

424
00:36:12.576 --> 00:36:14.345
Walter?

425
00:37:20.941 --> 00:37:23.381
Oh. Walter.

426
00:37:27.981 --> 00:37:29.750
Fuck.

427
00:37:39.091 --> 00:37:42.301
Hey. I need to talk to you.
It's important.

428
00:37:43.535 --> 00:37:44.666
I need your help.

429
00:37:44.768 --> 00:37:46.305
Of course. Anything.

430
00:37:46.407 --> 00:37:48.802
I need you to get me
some info on someone.

431
00:37:48.904 --> 00:37:51.068
Who's the lucky guy?

432
00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:53.312
Uh. Scout Sniper.

433
00:37:53.414 --> 00:37:54.808
I think he's local.

434
00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:57.910
Pull up a chair here.
See what we got here.

435
00:37:58.616 --> 00:38:01.848
- Can't find anything
on our database.

436
00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:05.489
-Guy's a damn ghost.
-Lucky for you. my database

437
00:38:05.591 --> 00:38:07.755
starts where the P.D.
leaves off.

438
00:38:10.892 --> 00:38:15.026
Wait. That's him.

439
00:38:15.128 --> 00:38:17.028
Scout Sniper courses
takes men like this

440
00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:18.997
and teaches them to do things
that most of us would find

441
00:38:19.099 --> 00:38:20.669
difficult to stomach.

442
00:38:20.771 --> 00:38:22.572
Some men are just
good at killing.

443
00:38:22.674 --> 00:38:24.002
Yo. V. if you want me
dig in deeper.

444
00:38:24.104 --> 00:38:28.710
I need to know.
what's our level of emergency?

445
00:38:28.812 --> 00:38:32.978
He killed my partner
and another officer last night.

446
00:38:36.819 --> 00:38:38.423
What can I do?

447
00:38:38.525 --> 00:38:40.821
If you run. he'll find you.

448
00:38:40.923 --> 00:38:44.462
-That's comforting.
-That's the truth. This. uh...

449
00:38:44.564 --> 00:38:47.861
This is Carlo Garcia
is in a whole nother league.

450
00:38:47.963 --> 00:38:49.797
You're fighting out
of your weight class.

451
00:38:49.899 --> 00:38:51.634
I'm going to put a cap
in this fucker.

452
00:38:51.736 --> 00:38:52.833
You're gonna get
yourself killed.

453
00:38:52.935 --> 00:38:55.374
Well. I can't run.

454
00:38:55.476 --> 00:38:56.969
I can't fight.

455
00:38:57.071 --> 00:38:58.509
They have someone
inside the department.

456
00:38:58.611 --> 00:39:00.478
so I can't turn myself in.

457
00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:02.711
Doesn't look like
I got a lot of options.

458
00:39:02.813 --> 00:39:05.010
Shape your battlefield and wait
till he comes for you.

459
00:39:05.112 --> 00:39:08.915
It will be unexpected.
So you've got to be ready.

460
00:39:09.017 --> 00:39:10.554
And then?

461
00:39:10.656 --> 00:39:11.852
If you're lucky.
you'll get your shot.

462
00:39:11.954 --> 00:39:15.823
Hm. that's. uh...

463
00:39:15.925 --> 00:39:17.561
terrible advice.

464
00:39:17.663 --> 00:39:21.829
I know. but you don't
go chasing the devil.

465
00:39:22.601 --> 00:39:26.702
So you fucked up.
Now you need my help.

466
00:39:26.804 --> 00:39:28.836
- She has her cell.
and we have her number.

467
00:39:28.938 --> 00:39:31.806
All we need is someone
to hack into it.

468
00:39:31.908 --> 00:39:35.513
track her down. Carlo. and I
will take care of the rest.

469
00:39:35.615 --> 00:39:37.009
No big deal.

470
00:39:37.111 --> 00:39:38.450
This is his problem.

471
00:39:38.552 --> 00:39:40.452
I know. but he's my partner.

472
00:39:40.554 --> 00:39:42.047
- Only for two months.

473
00:39:42.149 --> 00:39:44.984
You think he'd do
the same thing for you?

474
00:39:45.086 --> 00:39:46.821
- I would hope so.

475
00:39:48.561 --> 00:39:54.059
I want to say something to you.
and I mean this as a friend.

476
00:39:54.161 --> 00:39:55.929
Go ahead. shoot.

477
00:39:56.031 --> 00:40:00.197
I'm concerned that
you've become unreliable.

478
00:40:00.299 --> 00:40:01.902
- It's been
a rough couple days.

479
00:40:02.004 --> 00:40:03.970
We'll clean this mess up.
and then it's clear sailing.

480
00:40:04.072 --> 00:40:05.675
No big deal.

481
00:40:05.777 --> 00:40:08.612
I think you need a vacation.
You're getting old.

482
00:40:08.714 --> 00:40:11.747
Yeah.
both of those are correct.

483
00:40:11.849 --> 00:40:15.487
but be honest with yourself.

484
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:17.016
You looked in the mirror lately?

485
00:40:17.118 --> 00:40:19.458
-I'd trade my soul

486
00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:20.624
to be 20 again.

487
00:40:20.726 --> 00:40:24.056
What are you two
rambling on about?

488
00:40:24.158 --> 00:40:27.994
That youth is wasted on
the young.

489
00:40:28.096 --> 00:40:30.568
And unfortunate
that experience is wasted

490
00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:33.164
on those who don't
take time to enjoy life.

491
00:40:33.266 --> 00:40:35.672
Arnold. I have a lot to do.
We'll be back here this evening.

492
00:40:35.774 --> 00:40:37.905
Let's go.

493
00:40:38.007 --> 00:40:42.140
I'll call my guy.
He'll be in touch.

494
00:40:42.242 --> 00:40:44.076
Alright?

495
00:40:44.178 --> 00:40:46.683
Take care. Gabe. Let's go.

496
00:40:46.785 --> 00:40:48.883
Later. boss.

497
00:41:06.639 --> 00:41:09.706
Seven languages.

498
00:41:09.808 --> 00:41:12.676
Combat action ribbon.

499
00:41:12.778 --> 00:41:15.239
Firearms instructor.

500
00:41:16.682 --> 00:41:20.552
Detective Service ribbon.
Police star.

501
00:41:20.654 --> 00:41:21.949
Geez.

502
00:41:30.927 --> 00:41:33.598
April 2nd.

503
00:41:38.638 --> 00:41:40.869
April 2nd.

504
00:43:35.755 --> 00:43:37.249
This is Officer Lopez.

505
00:43:37.351 --> 00:43:39.889
-I'm looking for Daley.
-He hasn't come in today.

506
00:43:39.991 --> 00:43:41.154
I'm covering his desk.

507
00:43:41.256 --> 00:43:43.024
-Where is he?
-Ma'am. that's not --

508
00:43:43.126 --> 00:43:45.158
This is Detective Flynn.
I need to speak with him.

509
00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:46.830
- Detective Flynn?

510
00:43:46.932 --> 00:43:49.096
I'm under strict orders
to advise you to come in.

511
00:43:50.529 --> 00:43:52.704
Damn it!

512
00:43:55.038 --> 00:43:57.709
-Good to see you.
-Oh. nice to see you.

513
00:43:57.811 --> 00:44:00.712
If you guys need anything else.
I'd be more than happy.

514
00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:06.014
Business or pleasure?

515
00:44:06.116 --> 00:44:07.752
What do you mean?

516
00:44:07.854 --> 00:44:09.050
What you're thinking about.

517
00:44:09.152 --> 00:44:12.251
Well. well.
a little bit of both.

518
00:44:12.353 --> 00:44:13.758
Intriguing.

519
00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:16.959
Mm-hmm.
Yeah. I'm thinking about Gabe.

520
00:44:17.962 --> 00:44:19.192
What about him?

521
00:44:19.294 --> 00:44:21.898
Honestly. he's becoming
a liability.

522
00:44:23.968 --> 00:44:25.396
I don't want to pry
into your business.

523
00:44:25.498 --> 00:44:27.200
You know that.

524
00:44:27.302 --> 00:44:28.872
But remember. Gabe doesn't just
work for you.

525
00:44:28.974 --> 00:44:31.072
He's your friend.

526
00:44:31.174 --> 00:44:34.174
That's what makes it so hard.

527
00:44:35.947 --> 00:44:37.980
- Hey. what the fuck?

528
00:44:38.082 --> 00:44:39.949
Hey. what are you guys doing?

529
00:44:55.967 --> 00:44:58.066
- Give me the fucking gun.

530
00:45:14.018 --> 00:45:16.051
Look at me. motherfucker.

531
00:45:27.262 --> 00:45:28.833
Yeah? What's up?

532
00:45:28.935 --> 00:45:31.165
- Gabe. they've hit Arnold.

533
00:45:31.267 --> 00:45:32.936
-Oh.
-Took one in the arm.

534
00:45:33.038 --> 00:45:34.102
but he's okay.

535
00:45:34.204 --> 00:45:37.204
-Who was on point?
-LaFontaine.

536
00:45:37.306 --> 00:45:40.174
Arnold was having dinner
with his wife.

537
00:45:40.276 --> 00:45:41.538
They made a mess of her.

538
00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:43.947
-Where they at now?
-City medical center.

539
00:45:44.049 --> 00:45:46.015
Second floor.

540
00:45:59.426 --> 00:46:02.064
He's been asking for you.

541
00:46:03.331 --> 00:46:04.396
How's Tomi?

542
00:46:04.498 --> 00:46:07.234
She died on the operating table.

543
00:46:07.336 --> 00:46:10.006
Arnold is going
to be raising hell.

544
00:46:10.108 --> 00:46:13.240
As official counsel.
I must strongly advise

545
00:46:13.342 --> 00:46:15.011
against that course of action.

546
00:46:15.113 --> 00:46:17.915
We spent too many years
turning this into

547
00:46:18.017 --> 00:46:20.544
a legitimate business
to throw it all away

548
00:46:20.646 --> 00:46:23.888
over a base desire for revenge.

549
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:25.549
So your ancient
Greeks don't believe in

550
00:46:25.651 --> 00:46:27.353
an eye for an eye. huh?

551
00:46:27.455 --> 00:46:30.521
- Well. actually. they
called it necessary reciprocity.

552
00:46:30.623 --> 00:46:34.393
When Odysseus returned to Ithaca
after the Trojan War

553
00:46:34.495 --> 00:46:37.528
and found that his wife Penelope
had been unfaithful.

554
00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:41.202
he murdered all 108
of her noble suitors.

555
00:46:41.304 --> 00:46:45.338
and then he slaughtered
and mutilated his own servants

556
00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:49.881
for allowing
the indiscretions to happen.

557
00:46:50.378 --> 00:46:53.852
Sounds like a man who brought
his war home with him then.

558
00:46:53.954 --> 00:46:58.219
He did indeed.
And everyone paid the price.

559
00:47:02.027 --> 00:47:03.928
So I'm leaving.

560
00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:05.556
Whether or not I return
will depend on

561
00:47:05.658 --> 00:47:07.492
Arnold's course of action.

562
00:47:07.594 --> 00:47:11.496
But I am not
interested in fighting a war.

563
00:47:11.598 --> 00:47:14.301
Having said that.
I don't think you and I

564
00:47:14.403 --> 00:47:17.271
will be seeing each other again.

565
00:47:17.373 --> 00:47:19.174
I like you. Gabe.

566
00:47:19.276 --> 00:47:21.913
Don't get caught
in the undertow.

567
00:47:34.158 --> 00:47:36.125
They killed her.

568
00:47:36.227 --> 00:47:39.491
They killed my wife.

569
00:47:39.593 --> 00:47:43.264
-Carlo.
-Yes?

570
00:47:43.366 --> 00:47:46.597
Clear this room.
Get out of here now.

571
00:47:46.699 --> 00:47:50.106
- Alright. everyone.
Let's go. Do as the man says.

572
00:47:50.208 --> 00:47:53.241
Get out of here. boys.
Don't move.

573
00:47:57.247 --> 00:47:58.543
I'm sorry.

574
00:47:58.645 --> 00:48:01.546
-Boss --
-Shut up. Don't talk.

575
00:48:04.056 --> 00:48:05.957
You see that?

576
00:48:06.059 --> 00:48:07.926
You see what you fuckin' did?

577
00:48:12.559 --> 00:48:14.559
Stop it!

578
00:48:14.661 --> 00:48:16.066
Get the fuck out of here.

579
00:48:16.168 --> 00:48:18.497
Go! Go.

580
00:48:19.302 --> 00:48:20.631
Close the door!

581
00:48:20.733 --> 00:48:22.402
Carlo. stay.

582
00:48:24.307 --> 00:48:26.274
I want them to suffer.

583
00:48:26.376 --> 00:48:29.145
Don't you worry. baby.
They will.

584
00:48:29.247 --> 00:48:32.984
First. you're going
to need some rest.

585
00:48:33.086 --> 00:48:36.515
-Not if they're still breathing.
-They won't be for long.

586
00:48:38.519 --> 00:48:43.357
We go to war. we need you
thinking clearly. alright?

587
00:48:43.459 --> 00:48:45.491
Stakes are way too high.

588
00:48:45.593 --> 00:48:47.262
- You're right.

589
00:48:49.299 --> 00:48:51.332
You're always right.

590
00:48:51.434 --> 00:48:53.169
- I'm gonna
stay here for a while.

591
00:48:53.271 --> 00:48:55.732
Go find out what you can.

592
00:48:55.834 --> 00:48:57.305
I'll see you later. man. okay?

593
00:48:57.407 --> 00:48:59.010
Thank you.

594
00:49:02.708 --> 00:49:04.246
I loved her.

595
00:49:04.348 --> 00:49:06.215
She loved you. too.

596
00:49:07.746 --> 00:49:10.186
I'm sorry. brother.

597
00:49:10.288 --> 00:49:12.386
- I really loved her.

598
00:49:12.488 --> 00:49:14.256
I know.

599
00:49:19.428 --> 00:49:21.263
Oh. fuck.

600
00:50:31.830 --> 00:50:36.371
Shooters were professionals.
Not from around here.

601
00:50:36.473 --> 00:50:38.241
What kind of gun they use?

602
00:50:38.343 --> 00:50:40.639
In Mexico. it's known
as a cuerno de chivo

603
00:50:40.741 --> 00:50:43.246
because the magazine looks
like a goat's horn.

604
00:50:43.348 --> 00:50:45.182
They just love it.
and they definitely use it

605
00:50:45.284 --> 00:50:46.711
to make a statement.

606
00:50:46.813 --> 00:50:48.713
If you asked me. the money is
on the Colombian Mexican.

607
00:50:48.815 --> 00:50:50.847
Someone tied to Velasquez then.

608
00:50:50.949 --> 00:50:53.817
Or made to look that way.

609
00:50:53.919 --> 00:50:56.358
Oh. yeah? Who do you figure?

610
00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:58.591
Have we heard from Vlady?

611
00:50:58.693 --> 00:51:01.528
I don't know. boss.
What motive would he have?

612
00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:03.596
Me out of the way.

613
00:51:03.698 --> 00:51:05.763
Makes things a lot easier.
doesn't it?

614
00:51:05.865 --> 00:51:08.172
Follett's gonna be pissed
if we move on Vlady.

615
00:51:08.274 --> 00:51:09.338
That's for damn sure.

616
00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:10.603
- Fuck him!

617
00:51:10.705 --> 00:51:12.605
I'll handle that son of a bitch.

618
00:51:12.707 --> 00:51:15.311
It's my call.

619
00:51:15.413 --> 00:51:16.840
You sure about this?

620
00:51:16.942 --> 00:51:19.414
- You're goddamn right.

621
00:51:19.516 --> 00:51:21.581
They killed my wife!

622
00:51:21.683 --> 00:51:23.286
We're talking about her!

623
00:51:23.388 --> 00:51:26.520
Fine. You got it.

624
00:51:28.425 --> 00:51:30.491
It'll get done.

625
00:51:39.403 --> 00:51:42.371
- The hit had to be
retaliation for Velasquez.

626
00:51:42.473 --> 00:51:44.604
Vlady has no motive.

627
00:51:44.706 --> 00:51:48.179
I'm telling you.
Arnold's losing it.

628
00:51:48.281 --> 00:51:49.807
This is a mistake.

629
00:51:49.909 --> 00:51:52.249
You don't just hit a Russian
mobster 'cause you're pissed.

630
00:51:57.751 --> 00:52:01.654
Got a hit on the girl.
She's at the Terrace Motel.

631
00:52:01.756 --> 00:52:05.922
Great. Deal with this.
then I'll finish her off.

632
00:52:06.024 --> 00:52:08.199
Question. Look.

633
00:52:08.301 --> 00:52:10.168
I'm trying to hide it
in the front.

634
00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:12.632
Looks like a big fat dick.
so I just --

635
00:52:12.734 --> 00:52:13.897
I don't -- I don't
know what to do.

636
00:52:13.999 --> 00:52:16.471
How do you hide a gun
with a camera?

637
00:52:18.607 --> 00:52:20.442
How do you do it?

638
00:52:20.544 --> 00:52:22.939
Buck up. man.

639
00:52:23.041 --> 00:52:25.414

I'm gonna head up
to see Vlady. huh?

652
00:53:22.672 --> 00:53:24.836
What's up. man?

653
00:53:25.344 --> 00:53:26.838
How's the Russian doing?

654
00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:28.642
He up there yelling
at everybody. stressed out.

655
00:53:28.744 --> 00:53:30.281
Geez. What's new?

656
00:53:30.383 --> 00:53:33.713
Hey. keep an eye
on this guy for me. huh?

657
00:53:40.722 --> 00:53:43.426
And I'm still here
at the kids table. huh?

658
00:53:43.528 --> 00:53:45.659
They don't let you listen to
the grown-ups talk either. huh?

659
00:53:45.761 --> 00:53:49.333
-Disrespectful is what it is.
-Yeah.

660
00:53:57.068 --> 00:53:59.739
Whoa. whoa. Hey. hey.
No. no. no.

661
00:53:59.841 --> 00:54:02.808
Strict orders. no visitors.

662
00:54:03.481 --> 00:54:05.943
Arnold called Vlady.
I have a delivery for him.

663
00:54:06.045 --> 00:54:09.452
-Don't you go in there. Gabe.
-Why do you say that?

664
00:54:09.554 --> 00:54:12.488
I have an appointment.
I am making a payment.

665
00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:17.295
-I don't give a fuck.
-Look. I have an appointment.

666
00:54:17.397 --> 00:54:18.890
Here is the envelope.

667
00:54:18.992 --> 00:54:21.024
Listen. Vlady makes
his Russian calls.

668
00:54:21.126 --> 00:54:24.060
but I make all his American
calls on the accountability

669
00:54:24.162 --> 00:54:26.997
that he does not
speak great English.

670
00:54:27.099 --> 00:54:28.702
-You're lying. dude.

671
00:54:28.804 --> 00:54:32.068
I don't know. man.
Maybe they texted each other.

672
00:54:32.170 --> 00:54:34.609
But it's going to be me or you.

673
00:54:34.711 --> 00:54:38.041
Either way.
he's going to have to get it.

674
00:54:41.453 --> 00:54:43.387
You want to take it to him?

675
00:54:47.822 --> 00:54:49.459
Go ahead. I'm sorry. Gabe.

676
00:54:49.561 --> 00:54:51.087
Thank you. brother.

677
00:54:51.189 --> 00:54:54.057
It's been tense. He's fucking
losing his mind. I'm sorry.

678
00:54:54.159 --> 00:54:55.399
Ah!

679
00:55:10.812 --> 00:55:12.009
Ah!

680
00:55:40.006 --> 00:55:41.610
Ah!

681
00:56:11.939 --> 00:56:14.071
You should have just shot him.

682
00:56:15.008 --> 00:56:16.810
Kitchen.

683
00:56:31.827 --> 00:56:34.531
- Tell me again.
Why are we burning this place?

684
00:56:36.194 --> 00:56:38.469
It's called sending a message.

685
00:56:53.651 --> 00:56:57.752
-Is it done?
-You watching the local news?

686
00:56:57.854 --> 00:57:01.019
-No witnesses this time?
-No.

687
00:57:01.121 --> 00:57:03.890
Good. They'll blame
the Mexicans.

688
00:57:03.992 --> 00:57:05.958
You mean you'll
blame the Mexicans?

689
00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:07.663
What's with the attitude?

690
00:57:07.765 --> 00:57:11.128
We just kicked a hornet's nest
for no good reason.

691
00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:13.867
- I gave the order.
That's all the reason you need.

692
00:57:13.969 --> 00:57:16.672
What's the deal
with the fucking detective?

693
00:57:16.774 --> 00:57:20.775
You gave me your word.
So take care of her.

694
00:57:20.877 --> 00:57:23.074
-I will.
-Don't tell me.

695
00:57:23.176 --> 00:57:24.713
Show me.

696
00:57:26.310 --> 00:57:30.081
I'm telling you. He's losing it.

697
00:57:30.183 --> 00:57:32.017
Drop me at my car.

698
00:57:32.119 --> 00:57:33.755
- Got to
take a shower anyways.

699
00:57:33.857 --> 00:57:36.153
I'm all fucking covered
in Esteban.

700
00:57:36.255 --> 00:57:38.529
- Bodies of a nightclub
owner and three of his staff

701
00:57:38.631 --> 00:57:41.862
were discovered in the charred
remains of a property fire.

702
00:57:41.964 --> 00:57:44.502
A pair of audacious
cartel style killings

703
00:57:44.604 --> 00:57:47.263
rocked the city yesterday
when gunmen opened fire

704
00:57:47.365 --> 00:57:49.166
on a restaurant in Jackson.

705
00:57:49.268 --> 00:57:52.609
One of the shooting victims has
been identified as Tomi Solomon.

706
00:57:52.711 --> 00:57:55.040
wife of local real estate
magnate Arnold Solomon.

707
00:57:55.142 --> 00:57:56.910
who's long been suspected
of having ties

708
00:57:57.012 --> 00:57:58.615
to organized crime.

709
00:57:58.717 --> 00:58:00.045
Solomon. seen here --

710
00:58:00.147 --> 00:58:03.246
You went after the competition.

711
00:58:03.348 --> 00:58:06.216
But the competition hit back.

712
00:59:20.292 --> 00:59:23.898
- Gabe here.
Leave a message.

713
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.802
- Hey. Gabe.
Where the fuck are you?

714
00:59:26.904 --> 00:59:28.133
This is the third time
I've called.

715
00:59:28.235 --> 00:59:31.642
We're here at the motel
waiting for you.

716
00:59:31.744 --> 00:59:35.745
This is going down
whether you're here or not.

717
00:59:42.688 --> 00:59:45.183
No answer from Gabe. Let's roll.

718
00:59:58.198 --> 01:00:01.100
You want it all. don't you.
bastard.

719
01:00:30.495 --> 01:00:32.934
On the floor quick!

720
01:01:05.067 --> 01:01:07.232
What the fuck is
going on out here?

721
01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:15.878
Fuck.

722
01:01:33.931 --> 01:01:35.029
Get in!

723
01:01:35.131 --> 01:01:36.767
Fuck you!

724
01:01:36.869 --> 01:01:39.000
Get in or you're dead!

725
01:01:40.136 --> 01:01:42.135
Come on!

726
01:02:06.865 --> 01:02:08.161
Yeah. go ahead.

727
01:02:08.263 --> 01:02:09.426
What the fuck
are you doing. Gabe?

728
01:02:09.528 --> 01:02:10.768
Have you lost your mind?

729
01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:12.330
You don't understand. man.

730
01:02:12.432 --> 01:02:14.398
- Quit the fucking bullshit
right now.

731
01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:18.776
Just bring her back.
You're playing with my life.

732
01:02:18.878 --> 01:02:21.042
- Ain't gonna happen.

733
01:02:26.082 --> 01:02:28.148
You know what happens now?

734
01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:29.380
I wrote the book.

735
01:02:29.482 --> 01:02:31.283
You do what the fuck
you go to do.

736
01:02:39.129 --> 01:02:41.293
Put your safety belt on.

737
01:03:00.919 --> 01:03:02.215
Go ahead.

738
01:03:02.317 --> 01:03:03.986
What the fuck is going on?

739
01:03:04.088 --> 01:03:05.823
- I'm done. man.

740
01:03:05.925 --> 01:03:08.056
I'm tendering
my resignation. sir.

741
01:03:08.158 --> 01:03:10.256
- You quit when
I say you quit.

742
01:03:10.358 --> 01:03:11.994
Now. where's the girl?

743
01:03:12.096 --> 01:03:14.392
- She's with me.
That's where she staying.

744
01:03:14.494 --> 01:03:16.526
If you're smart.
you'll let us both go.

745
01:03:16.628 --> 01:03:19.001
You think I'm going
to let her walk away?

746
01:03:19.103 --> 01:03:20.266
- Listen. man.

747
01:03:20.368 --> 01:03:23.302
You were with me when
Alex died. right?

748
01:03:23.404 --> 01:03:24.908
Tomi is dead now.

749
01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:26.569
- You bring that up.
you piece of shit?

750
01:03:26.671 --> 01:03:28.340
Don't let it ruin your life.
my friend.

751
01:03:28.442 --> 01:03:30.078
I'm going to hunt you down.

752
01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:32.377
Don't make promises
you can't keep. okay?

753
01:03:32.479 --> 01:03:35.380
You know what this means.

754
01:03:35.482 --> 01:03:37.085
Have a good night.

755
01:03:43.522 --> 01:03:46.127
Bring me that bastard's head.

756
01:03:49.297 --> 01:03:52.034
Let me bring you in.

757
01:03:52.136 --> 01:03:53.431
You can turn state
against Solomon.

758
01:03:53.533 --> 01:03:57.039
We'd both be dead
before I could testify.

759
01:03:57.141 --> 01:04:00.537
That guy. Carlo Garcia.
he your partner?

760
01:04:00.639 --> 01:04:02.473
- Yeah. he was.

761
01:04:02.575 --> 01:04:04.079
If we're lucky.
he'll put as much distance

762
01:04:04.181 --> 01:04:05.982
between us as he can.

763
01:04:06.084 --> 01:04:08.578
I had lots of luck lately.

764
01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:10.085
All of it bad.

765
01:04:10.187 --> 01:04:13.253
Oh. relax.
How much worse can it get?

766
01:04:15.961 --> 01:04:19.930
I've got a feeling
I'm gonna find out.

767
01:04:49.456 --> 01:04:51.423
Relax.

768
01:04:51.525 --> 01:04:53.458
Sit down.

769
01:04:54.593 --> 01:04:56.428
We can both use this.

770
01:05:03.008 --> 01:05:05.371
Is this your wife?

771
01:05:05.473 --> 01:05:07.670
Yes. Yes.

772
01:05:07.772 --> 01:05:10.145
- She passed.

773
01:05:10.247 --> 01:05:11.982
Mm-hmm.

774
01:05:18.221 --> 01:05:19.616
You okay?

775
01:05:19.718 --> 01:05:21.585
Look. you've worked for
Solomon for years.

776
01:05:21.687 --> 01:05:23.653
You could have dropped me back
at the motel.

777
01:05:23.755 --> 01:05:27.327
Now we're
having drinks.

778
01:05:27.429 --> 01:05:29.527
Why?

779
01:05:29.629 --> 01:05:31.969
I made someone a promise.

780
01:05:32.071 --> 01:05:33.300
Alex.

781
01:05:33.402 --> 01:05:35.104
She wanted me out of this life.

782
01:05:35.206 --> 01:05:37.073
Get away. escape to Africa.

783
01:05:37.175 --> 01:05:39.636
Put my experience to good use.
protect the elephants.

784
01:05:39.738 --> 01:05:42.507
Fight the good fight.

785
01:05:42.609 --> 01:05:45.444
She discovered she had cancer.

786
01:05:45.546 --> 01:05:48.348
After she was gone. I was lost.

787
01:05:48.450 --> 01:05:50.317
Arnold was all I had left.

788
01:05:55.324 --> 01:05:57.720
I'm sorry about your wife.

789
01:05:58.789 --> 01:06:04.001
And I'm thankful you
let me live.

790
01:06:04.663 --> 01:06:07.565
But you're still a mob soldier.
and I'm still a cop.

791
01:06:07.667 --> 01:06:09.270
- Yeah. well.

792
01:06:09.372 --> 01:06:12.339
I'm afraid all I've done
is delayed the inevitable.

793
01:06:12.441 --> 01:06:15.243
We're both probably
going to die tonight.

794
01:06:15.345 --> 01:06:17.311
- So what's
your plan. then?

795
01:06:17.413 --> 01:06:19.181
What. have a drink.
drown your sorrows.

796
01:06:19.283 --> 01:06:20.776
and wait for them
to come calling?

797
01:06:20.878 --> 01:06:23.581
Yeah. well. pretty much. yeah.

798
01:06:23.683 --> 01:06:26.254
I built this place. designed it.

799
01:06:26.356 --> 01:06:28.256
The walls. the furniture.

800
01:06:28.358 --> 01:06:31.325
Everything's reinforced
and fireproof.

801
01:06:31.427 --> 01:06:34.559
And Alex's bathroom
is a de facto panic room.

802
01:06:37.333 --> 01:06:39.333
It's a fortress.

803
01:06:39.435 --> 01:06:41.038
You got booby traps?

804
01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:43.469
I've got guns.

805
01:06:43.571 --> 01:06:46.142
-That's all?
-A lot of guns.

806
01:06:46.244 --> 01:06:47.737
And I know how to use them.

807
01:06:47.839 --> 01:06:51.345
Plus. those guys
are coming to me.

808
01:06:51.447 --> 01:06:54.216
Got home field advantage.

809
01:06:54.318 --> 01:06:56.680
I've killed people
for a lot less.

810
01:06:56.782 --> 01:07:00.354
Yeah.
You have. haven't you?

811
01:07:00.456 --> 01:07:02.422
Yes. I have.

812
01:07:02.524 --> 01:07:05.128
Let's get ready for our guests.
shall we?

813
01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:07.394
They'll be here soon.

814
01:07:07.496 --> 01:07:10.298
Nothing short of a direct hit
from an artillery round

815
01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:12.366
will breach this room.

816
01:07:12.468 --> 01:07:15.270
If things go south.
and they will.

817
01:07:15.372 --> 01:07:18.768
lock the door
and lay in the tub.

818
01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:21.375
Hiding is not my style.

819
01:07:21.477 --> 01:07:24.708
Sometimes it's a difference
between living and dying.

820
01:07:26.547 --> 01:07:29.746
Well. if shit hits the fan.
I know where to find you.

821
01:07:29.848 --> 01:07:31.418
Hm.

822
01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:33.123
In the tub.

823
01:07:34.588 --> 01:07:36.357
Duly noted.

824
01:07:39.593 --> 01:07:42.627
I don't know what happened.

825
01:07:42.729 --> 01:07:44.332
I mean. that fucking cop.

826
01:07:44.434 --> 01:07:48.303
Just get rid of them both.
Whatever the cost.

827
01:07:48.405 --> 01:07:51.174
Both?

828
01:07:51.276 --> 01:07:52.406
But he's my partner.

829
01:07:52.508 --> 01:07:54.540
He's one of my oldest friends.

830
01:07:54.642 --> 01:07:57.411
I got no choice.

831
01:07:57.513 --> 01:08:00.150
I mean. is this even worth it?

832
01:08:00.252 --> 01:08:02.581
Survival of the fittest.

833
01:08:02.683 --> 01:08:04.814
- When Gabe brought me on.

834
01:08:04.916 --> 01:08:08.818
I knew there'd be a day
when I'd be the one you'd call

835
01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:10.325
when things needed to be taken
care of.

836
01:08:10.427 --> 01:08:12.591
He made his choice.

837
01:08:12.693 --> 01:08:14.725
Now you make yours.

838
01:08:17.565 --> 01:08:19.334
You got it. boss.

839
01:08:36.617 --> 01:08:39.651
A bunch of serious
looking assholes.

840
01:08:39.753 --> 01:08:43.754
And a guy with
a porn star mustache.

841
01:08:43.856 --> 01:08:45.459
- LaFontaine.

842
01:08:45.561 --> 01:08:46.889
Open the damn door. Gabe!

843
01:08:46.991 --> 01:08:48.363
- He dangerous?

844
01:08:48.465 --> 01:08:51.465
Could use a better
deodorant maybe.

845
01:08:51.567 --> 01:08:53.236
Come on.

846
01:08:53.338 --> 01:08:54.930
I ain't got time
for this horseshit.

847
01:08:55.032 --> 01:08:57.702
Don't nobody do nothing
unless I say.

848
01:09:14.325 --> 01:09:17.227
Gabe. I'm taking
that lady cop back

849
01:09:17.329 --> 01:09:19.262
to Mr. Solomon.

850
01:09:19.364 --> 01:09:21.561
With or without your consent.

851
01:09:22.828 --> 01:09:24.762
- Just like that. huh?

852
01:09:24.864 --> 01:09:27.402
- Yep.

853
01:09:27.504 --> 01:09:29.338
So. what's it gonna be?

854
01:09:30.770 --> 01:09:33.276
So let me get this straight.

855
01:09:35.709 --> 01:09:38.743
I let you take her.

856
01:09:38.845 --> 01:09:40.514
I go free.

857
01:09:40.616 --> 01:09:42.681
Sure. Gabe.

858
01:09:42.783 --> 01:09:45.387
For old times' sake.

859
01:09:45.489 --> 01:09:47.290
Okay.

860
01:09:47.392 --> 01:09:50.359
Sounds like a good deal.

861
01:09:50.461 --> 01:09:52.526
For old times' sake.

862
01:10:09.039 --> 01:10:11.677
You done fucked up now. Gabe.

863
01:10:11.779 --> 01:10:14.317
Perhaps.

864
01:10:17.917 --> 01:10:19.388
It'll take them
a while to regroup.

865
01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:21.390
but they'll be back.

866
01:10:26.089 --> 01:10:28.991
- You had it good
for a while. didn't you?

867
01:10:29.093 --> 01:10:31.796
Cars. big house in the country.

868
01:10:31.898 --> 01:10:34.502
Plenty of money
to save lots of elephants.

869
01:10:34.604 --> 01:10:35.833
I'm guessing
your wife never knew

870
01:10:35.935 --> 01:10:38.033
where it all really
came from until she did.

871
01:10:38.135 --> 01:10:40.310
And that's when you had
to make your promise.

872
01:10:40.412 --> 01:10:41.707
Jealous?

873
01:10:43.447 --> 01:10:46.008
I sleep soundly knowing
I put away the bad guys.

874
01:10:46.110 --> 01:10:49.880
Well. I guess there's no softer
pillow than a clear conscience.

875
01:10:52.456 --> 01:10:57.657
One time.
a meth dealer on the east side.

876
01:10:57.759 --> 01:11:02.596
We served a warrant and kicked
in his door at- 00 a.m.

877
01:11:02.698 --> 01:11:06.468
He had three kids. Daughters.

878
01:11:06.570 --> 01:11:08.470
What he made them do.

879
01:11:08.572 --> 01:11:11.638
Parents are supposed
to protect their children.

880
01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:14.443
I drew down on him.

881
01:11:14.545 --> 01:11:17.974
Not an officer
there would have talked.

882
01:11:18.076 --> 01:11:21.076
So. what did you end up doing?

883
01:11:22.585 --> 01:11:26.488
I called CPS and arrested him.

884
01:11:27.392 --> 01:11:29.458
I believe in the law. Gabriel.

885
01:11:32.991 --> 01:11:36.465
I guess that's why
you're a better person than me.

886
01:11:36.567 --> 01:11:38.434
Just like my Alex.

887
01:11:42.704 --> 01:11:44.605
The guy we're waiting for.
how good is he?

888
01:11:44.707 --> 01:11:47.410
- He thinks
he's as good as I am.

889
01:11:48.974 --> 01:11:50.039
He is younger.

890
01:11:50.141 --> 01:11:51.414
Mm.

891
01:11:51.516 --> 01:11:53.042
Not very reassuring.

892
01:11:53.144 --> 01:11:55.418
Yeah. well.
it wasn't meant to be.

893
01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:58.454
What if he's better than you?

894
01:12:00.821 --> 01:12:02.590
Bath time.

895
01:12:04.990 --> 01:12:06.891
Because you'll be next.

896
01:13:44.155 --> 01:13:45.990
Mind if I come in?

897
01:13:46.092 --> 01:13:49.499
I've asked him for five minutes
to talk to you.

898
01:13:49.601 --> 01:13:51.160
You owe me that.

899
01:13:51.262 --> 01:13:53.701
Come on.

900
01:13:56.134 --> 01:13:58.068
I got it.

901
01:14:34.877 --> 01:14:39.076
Some people claim
there's a woman to blame.

902
01:14:40.816 --> 01:14:42.948
But I know...

903
01:14:43.918 --> 01:14:45.852
...it's my own damn fault.

904
01:15:06.974 --> 01:15:09.271
Caused a lot of trouble.
senorita.

905
01:15:11.374 --> 01:15:14.111
You sure you want this?

906
01:15:14.213 --> 01:15:16.212
What's done is done.

907
01:15:16.314 --> 01:15:17.719
We have five minutes before

908
01:15:17.821 --> 01:15:19.688
those guys come
storming up in here.

909
01:15:19.790 --> 01:15:22.790
Ex-agency shooters.
SX contractors.

910
01:15:22.892 --> 01:15:24.319
You know. the real deal.

911
01:15:24.421 --> 01:15:26.090
I'm sure you'll tag
some of them.

912
01:15:26.192 --> 01:15:29.291
but they'll get the job done.

913
01:15:35.266 --> 01:15:37.739
Why are you doing this?

914
01:15:37.841 --> 01:15:39.609
She's no one!

915
01:15:41.976 --> 01:15:44.075
Man. don't make me kill you.

916
01:15:47.014 --> 01:15:49.344
You're assuming a lot.

917
01:15:56.122 --> 01:15:58.859
Like a fucking western. huh?

918
01:15:58.961 --> 01:16:02.764
Like a fucking western.

919
01:16:05.769 --> 01:16:07.362
Love it.

920
01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:38.162
I'm much younger than you.

921
01:16:38.264 --> 01:16:39.999
Much faster.

922
01:16:40.430 --> 01:16:42.903
Better looking for sure.

923
01:16:43.005 --> 01:16:46.038
I'm ruthless.

924
01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:48.238
I can kill you in a heartbeat.

925
01:17:33.450 --> 01:17:35.252
What a waste.

926
01:17:43.801 --> 01:17:45.394
- It's time.

927
01:18:11.928 --> 01:18:14.192
Solomon's not paying you enough!

928
01:18:14.294 --> 01:18:17.294
Go home!
Live to fight another day.

929
01:18:17.396 --> 01:18:20.396
Any of you fuckers want
to leave. I'll kill you myself.

930
01:18:20.498 --> 01:18:24.169
Our mission is to take
this motherfucker out!

931
01:18:24.271 --> 01:18:25.973
None of you get paid --

932
01:19:11.153 --> 01:19:12.382
I'll go.

933
01:19:12.484 --> 01:19:13.856
I can cover the driveway.

934
01:19:13.958 --> 01:19:15.352
Go! Go ahead!

935
01:19:15.454 --> 01:19:17.222
Go! Go! Go!

936
01:19:50.389 --> 01:19:52.059
Ah!

937
01:20:05.041 --> 01:20:07.041
I thought you said this house
was impenetrable.

938
01:20:07.143 --> 01:20:08.537
- Well.
I thought so. too.

939
01:20:08.639 --> 01:20:12.508
I'm a contractor killer.
not a contract builder. okay?

940
01:20:18.648 --> 01:20:22.991
This doesn't look good.

941
01:20:24.522 --> 01:20:27.325
Come on! Take that out now!

942
01:20:29.164 --> 01:20:31.296
Time for me to get
some fresh air.

943
01:20:37.172 --> 01:20:39.106
Bath time.

944
01:20:40.703 --> 01:20:42.439
There you go.

945
01:20:43.211 --> 01:20:45.607
Stay hydrated.

946
01:22:40.559 --> 01:22:43.329
- Over here!
Behind the truck.

947
01:23:29.377 --> 01:23:31.113
Aaah!

948
01:24:25.763 --> 01:24:27.565
- Jesus Christ.

949
01:24:29.701 --> 01:24:35.309
Men that work for me
must be capable of violence.

950
01:24:35.872 --> 01:24:41.117
And also understand the power
of a well-placed threat.

951
01:24:41.219 --> 01:24:42.712
Yes. sir.

952
01:24:44.683 --> 01:24:45.682
Marine Corps?

953
01:24:45.784 --> 01:24:47.783
Navy. SEAL Team 4.

954
01:24:47.885 --> 01:24:49.752
- I need new shooters.

955
01:24:49.854 --> 01:24:52.194
My last guy moved on.

956
01:24:52.296 --> 01:24:53.789
Won't let you down.

957
01:24:59.566 --> 01:25:01.665
This is for Luis Velasquez.

958
01:25:37.835 --> 01:25:39.604
Do me a favor.

959
01:25:41.608 --> 01:25:43.806
Take care of this for me.

960
01:25:47.746 --> 01:25:50.417
Sure. I'll do that.

961
01:25:51.651 --> 01:25:53.321
Hey.

962
01:25:53.423 --> 01:25:54.916
I got your back.

963
01:26:47.938 --> 01:26:49.773
- You alright. Gabe?

964
01:26:51.810 --> 01:26:53.909
Yeah. man. I'm good.

965
01:27:20.037 --> 01:27:22.476
-You okay?
-All good. all good.

966
01:27:22.578 --> 01:27:24.808
