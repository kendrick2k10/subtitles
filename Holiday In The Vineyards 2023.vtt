3
00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:15.950
Yes!

4
00:01:16.034 --> 00:01:17.285
Nice!

5
00:01:19.704 --> 00:01:21.122
Carter Baldwyn!

6
00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:22.999
Of course.

7
00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:25.251
Hey. Earl.

8
00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:26.377
I. uh...

9
00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:29.339
It appears I missed
my morning wake-up call.

10
00:01:30.131 --> 00:01:32.217
Will you get your friends out of here?

11
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.134
Please?

12
00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:38.056
Oh.

13
00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:40.308
Those are business associates.

14
00:01:40.391 --> 00:01:41.601
They're from marketing.

15
00:01:41.684 --> 00:01:44.354
Well... Well. whatever they're selling.
they can't sell it here.

16
00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:45.355
Move!

17
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.066
What time is it?

18
00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.567
It's almost 11:00.

19
00:01:50.568 --> 00:01:52.320
She's gonna kill me.

20
00:01:52.403 --> 00:01:55.573
Hey. hey. hey. we gotta go.
I am late for brunch.

21
00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:58.576
- Up... Here you go.
- Are they done?

22
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.662
- Wait.
- We didn't finish our game.

23
00:02:00.745 --> 00:02:01.704
That's okay.

24
00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:06.876
Everybody hang on.

25
00:02:16.678 --> 00:02:17.637
Children.

26
00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:23.434
Hello?

27
00:02:24.727 --> 00:02:27.772
Nothing's sadder
than an empty glass.

28
00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:29.440
I don't know where the other waiter went.

29
00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:30.525
I'm so sorry.

30
00:02:30.608 --> 00:02:32.193
Ms. Baldwyn. right?

31
00:02:32.277 --> 00:02:33.736
Uh. what were you drinking?

32
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:34.779
My usual.

33
00:02:34.863 --> 00:02:36.781
Bring the bottle. Make it quick.

34
00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:48.543
Carter. are we still going to Vegas?

35
00:02:48.626 --> 00:02:49.752
Sorry. not today.

36
00:02:50.753 --> 00:02:51.880
Boo!

37
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.134
Well. maybe.
I'll... I'll call you.

38
00:02:56.926 --> 00:02:57.886
Yay!

39
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.306
Come on. come on. come on.

40
00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:12.942
Here you are. Mrs. Baldwyn.

41
00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:15.987
Is there anything else I can get--

42
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.488
Oh!

43
00:03:17.572 --> 00:03:19.908
What the hell is that?

44
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:21.784
It's your wine. I--

45
00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:22.785
Ugh!

46
00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:25.288
We sell that crap. we don't drink it.

47
00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:27.248
Ms. Baldwyn. I am so. so sorry.

48
00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:29.042
Joseph is new. He did not know.

49
00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:31.127
Don't stand there looking like an idiot.

50
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:35.048
Go get Ms. Baldwyn
a 2016 Louis Jadot Montrachet.

51
00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:36.132
<i>Tout de suite!</i>

52
00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:39.093
Ms. Baldwyn. only the most
sophisticated palate appreciates

53
00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:41.596
the subtle majesty. and beauty.
and warmth of chardonnay--

54
00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:43.765
- Bye-bye.
- You look beautiful today.

55
00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:46.226
Joseph!

56
00:03:50.104 --> 00:03:52.732
- Mother!
- Finally.

57
00:03:52.815 --> 00:03:54.025
What. no hug?

58
00:03:54.108 --> 00:03:55.485
How are you late?

59
00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:56.402
You live here.

60
00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:59.948
Well. I had a meeting with marketing.
and it went a little long.

61
00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:02.951
Uh...

62
00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:05.954
Is this ours?

63
00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:08.373
- That's for being late.
- Oh. it's awful.

64
00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.000
Your usual. madam.

65
00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:12.460
Make that my usual too.

66
00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:14.170
All right.

67
00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:16.589
Where's your analysis
for the third quarter numbers?

68
00:04:17.298 --> 00:04:19.384
Oh. it's all up here.

69
00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:20.843
You haven't finished it. have you?

70
00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:23.263
Did I mention how long my meeting went?

71
00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:28.559
I'm losing patience with you. Carter.

72
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.978
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:32.522
I have a job for you.

74
00:04:33.022 --> 00:04:34.983
I need you to go to Los Santos.

75
00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:36.025
Why?

76
00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:39.529
Because the only vineyard in Los Santos
that we don't already own

77
00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:40.947
is finally on the market.

78
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.783
It's 50 acres. and it's in probate.

79
00:04:43.866 --> 00:04:47.078
The executor is required to sell
the property by the 24th of December.

80
00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:49.080
You mean Christmas Eve?

81
00:04:49.163 --> 00:04:50.123
Whatever.

82
00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:51.874
You need to go today.

83
00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.293
Today?

84
00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:55.461
There's a showing up there
this afternoon at 3:00 p.m.

85
00:04:56.045 --> 00:04:57.880
Why don't you take one
of the corporate drones

86
00:04:57.964 --> 00:04:59.966
or a lawyer? Something?

87
00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:02.427
Because I need you to show me
that you can get a job done.

88
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.804
You're supposed to be taking over
this company one day.

89
00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:08.433
I never wanted this.

90
00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:12.770
And yet you gladly enjoy the lifestyle
that the money affords you. don't you?

91
00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:15.982
Point taken.

92
00:05:17.191 --> 00:05:18.443
I'll go.

93
00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:20.653
Good.

94
00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:22.363
So it's gonna take a little finesse.

95
00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:24.949
Blend in. If word gets out
that Baldwyn Wines is interested.

96
00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:26.784
we could find ourselves in a bidding war.

97
00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:29.746
With whom?

98
00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:32.081
Everybody knows Los Santos' grapes suck.

99
00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:34.167
No. there's another interested party.

100
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.962
You're gonna find out who they are.
what their resources are. and then.

101
00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:39.380
on the 23rd.

102
00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:42.508
we're gonna swoop in.
and we're gonna outbid 'em.

103
00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:45.678
Okay.

104
00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:48.890
Actually. I think there is
a nice resort in Los Santos. I--

105
00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:50.767
No. absolutely not.

106
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.226
I said blend in.

107
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.022
- We've already booked a place for you.
- Come on. you're killing me.

108
00:05:56.105 --> 00:05:56.939
Mmm.

109
00:05:57.774 --> 00:05:59.484
Oh. Emma's here.

110
00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:03.112
Thank you.

111
00:06:04.655 --> 00:06:06.240
Uh. you think she saw me?

112
00:06:06.824 --> 00:06:09.452
Please tell me that you
were a gentleman finally

113
00:06:09.535 --> 00:06:12.789
and spoke with her about the breakup
after that cowardly text message you left.

114
00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:13.956
Hmm?

115
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.501
- About that.
- You haven't spoken to her in person?

116
00:06:16.584 --> 00:06:18.044
Define "in person."

117
00:06:18.127 --> 00:06:19.295
Oh my God.

118
00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:22.131
I... I should probably just get out of here.

119
00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:24.384
Emma! Hi.

120
00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:29.222
Wow. you are stunning. and glowing.
And. man. does the Bahamas agree with you.

121
00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:31.182
How are you?

122
00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:33.393
Oh. I'm... I'm great.

123
00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:36.187
if great means going on
your honeymoon alone.

124
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.274
sad-sipping margaritas.
rereading your text over and over again.

125
00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:43.611
dreading the humiliation
that awaits back home.

126
00:06:46.155 --> 00:06:47.198
You're cruel.

127
00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:51.536
One could rightfully argue
being married to me would be far crueler.

128
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:53.955
Bullet dodged.

129
00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:56.707
See? Everyone wins.

130
00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:01.462
Yay.

131
00:07:02.171 --> 00:07:04.215
You know what. Carter?

132
00:07:04.298 --> 00:07:06.217
It's not anger I feel.

133
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.969
It's pity.

134
00:07:08.052 --> 00:07:12.849
Because your spoiled Peter Pan act
is pathetic.

135
00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:15.726
And I am so glad
I am not your Wendy.

136
00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.813
Because. see. women like me.
we don't need boys.

137
00:07:18.896 --> 00:07:21.023
We want men.

138
00:07:33.077 --> 00:07:34.120
Hmm.

139
00:07:34.203 --> 00:07:35.121
Great fruit.

140
00:07:35.788 --> 00:07:36.664
bright acid.

141
00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:39.375
clean finish. That's a nice rosÃ©.

142
00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:46.466
Hey. aren't we gonna finish the wine?

143
00:07:47.508 --> 00:07:48.718
Mom!

144
00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:49.844
Mom. wait.

145
00:07:49.927 --> 00:07:52.096
Honestly. Carter.
I can't take any more of you today.

146
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.015
What? I said I would go.

147
00:07:54.098 --> 00:07:55.600
Can I take the family jet?

148
00:07:55.683 --> 00:07:58.144
No. a car has been rented for you.

149
00:07:58.227 --> 00:07:59.312
It's Italian.

150
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.150
Nice! That'll do.

151
00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:05.943
That's mine.

152
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.239
That?

153
00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:11.491
Incognito.

154
00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:16.204
Does it come with clowns?

155
00:08:16.787 --> 00:08:17.747
Bye. Carter.

156
00:08:18.247 --> 00:08:20.291
By the way. if you don't finish this one.

157
00:08:20.374 --> 00:08:23.753
your Christmas present
is a nice swift kick in your ass.

158
00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:27.173
It's called Huckabee Vineyard.
Check your inbox.

159
00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:31.844
It vibrates a little over 30.

160
00:08:42.146 --> 00:08:42.980
Yeah.

161
00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:44.690
This should do it.

162
00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:52.782
<i>Dios mio!</i> 11:50? <i>Chicos!</i>

163
00:08:53.908 --> 00:08:54.825
Come eat!

164
00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:58.454
Boys!

165
00:08:59.747 --> 00:09:00.998
<i>Ahorita mismo!</i>

166
00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:04.794
Hey. buddy. We gotta go. Eat fast.

167
00:09:05.878 --> 00:09:08.506
- What about a protein shake?
- A what?

168
00:09:08.589 --> 00:09:11.008
I told you. I need it to bulk up.

169
00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:13.302
- That was a real thing?
- Yes.

170
00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:15.513
Matteo's brother put on 20 pounds
in middle school.

171
00:09:15.596 --> 00:09:18.015
Baby. Matteo's brother is half Samoan.

172
00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:19.350
Mom.

173
00:09:25.773 --> 00:09:27.108
That'll do for now.

174
00:09:27.191 --> 00:09:28.067
Where's your brother?

175
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.193
He's still in bed.

176
00:09:29.944 --> 00:09:30.820
What?

177
00:09:40.621 --> 00:09:44.083
Santi. baby.
what are you doing still in bed?

178
00:09:44.166 --> 00:09:45.084
We have to go.

179
00:09:45.167 --> 00:09:47.920
I don't wanna go. My stomach hurts.

180
00:09:48.629 --> 00:09:50.715
Can't I stay with you
and go to your appointment?

181
00:09:50.798 --> 00:09:52.550
You don't want to go to a party?

182
00:09:52.633 --> 00:09:55.386
Fernando sucks when we go
to birthday parties together.

183
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.598
He ignores me and tells me to go away
in front of his friends.

184
00:09:59.223 --> 00:10:02.435
I know it's hard.
but don't worry about Fernando today.

185
00:10:02.518 --> 00:10:05.313
- You'll have your own friends there.
- Who?

186
00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:09.108
Carl will be there.

187
00:10:09.191 --> 00:10:10.568
He picks his nose.

188
00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:12.612
Then don't hold his hand.

189
00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:13.654
Mom.

190
00:10:13.738 --> 00:10:16.907
Baby. Aunt Cindy
is gonna be here any moment.

191
00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:18.868
It's just for a couple hours.

192
00:10:20.703 --> 00:10:23.581
I love you until the cows come home.

193
00:10:25.374 --> 00:10:27.501
And the chickens fly north.

194
00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:29.003
Come here.

195
00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:31.380
Mmm.

196
00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:39.805
She's here. Let's go. Come on.

197
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:41.682
Come on in. Cindy.

198
00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:44.268
Okay. I'm ready to party!

199
00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:45.895
Santi's dragging his heels this morning.

200
00:10:45.978 --> 00:10:46.979
You know.

201
00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:50.441
kids' parties would be a lot more fun
if they just. like. let us drink wine.

202
00:10:50.524 --> 00:10:53.402
Wow. you should write
for a parenting magazine.

203
00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:54.320
<i>Chicos!</i>

204
00:10:54.403 --> 00:10:56.405
Hmm. I should.

205
00:10:57.031 --> 00:10:59.200
- Shotgun!
- I'll drop 'em off at 3:00.

206
00:10:59.283 --> 00:11:00.868
You always get shotgun.

207
00:11:03.537 --> 00:11:05.164
All right. monsters. let's roll!

208
00:11:09.418 --> 00:11:12.546
Hey. is your mom ever gonna do anything
with this guesthouse?

209
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:15.257
I don't know.
She keeps talking about it.

210
00:11:16.842 --> 00:11:17.760
You ready?

211
00:12:14.233 --> 00:12:17.319
Your mission.
should you choose to accept it.

212
00:12:18.237 --> 00:12:20.489
drive a Fiat in the middle of nowhere.

213
00:12:22.074 --> 00:12:23.993
This is gonna suck.

214
00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:33.294
For those of you
who may not know.

215
00:12:33.377 --> 00:12:38.799
this vineyard is the only remaining source
of local grapes in Los Santos.

216
00:12:38.883 --> 00:12:45.514
And this facility is where our precious
<i>garagistes</i> produce their wine.

217
00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:49.935
which are the true heart
and soul of our region.

218
00:12:50.686 --> 00:12:53.898
It's what makes Los Santos Los Santos.

219
00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:57.151
You'll find the bank's
appraised value of the estate

220
00:12:57.234 --> 00:12:59.195
and all of the details on the flyer.

221
00:12:59.278 --> 00:13:02.740
You know who we are up against here.

222
00:13:02.823 --> 00:13:05.743
Someone needs to keep this land

223
00:13:05.826 --> 00:13:08.287
and this facility

224
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:11.624
out of the greedy hands of Baldwyn Wines.

225
00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:17.546
Are you okay. sir?

226
00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.508
What? Yeah. Yeah.
sorry that just jumped out of nowhere.

227
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.344
Are you here for the estate sale?

228
00:13:24.678 --> 00:13:26.180
Uh. y... No.

229
00:13:26.263 --> 00:13:30.476
Um. I... I saw a sign for a wine tasting.
so I thought I'd stop in.

230
00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:32.603
Oh. sorry.

231
00:13:32.686 --> 00:13:36.232
The wine tasting room
hasn't been in operation for a while.

232
00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:38.108
Uh. this is a private meeting.

233
00:13:40.319 --> 00:13:43.656
Right. Uh. I'm sorry.
Sorry for interrupting. everyone.

234
00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:54.375
So. please take the materials home.
read them...

235
00:13:59.004 --> 00:14:00.089
Turn. Santi!

236
00:14:00.172 --> 00:14:01.674
Whoa!

237
00:14:05.803 --> 00:14:06.971
Whoa. champ.

238
00:14:07.054 --> 00:14:09.056
- You okay?
- Yeah.

239
00:14:09.139 --> 00:14:10.140
I'm all right.

240
00:14:12.351 --> 00:14:13.853
You killed the Baby Jesus!

241
00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.189
Oh. no. Baby Jesus survived.

242
00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:19.441
The crib may not have.

243
00:14:20.442 --> 00:14:21.610
It's a broken leg.

244
00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:23.571
- You know who could fix that?
- Who?

245
00:14:24.655 --> 00:14:25.489
Jesus.

246
00:14:26.323 --> 00:14:27.950
With what? Like. a miracle?

247
00:14:28.033 --> 00:14:29.827
No. he was a carpenter.

248
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:32.872
Right. right. His. uh... his side hustle.

249
00:14:34.164 --> 00:14:36.500
You gotta lower your stance. dude.

250
00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:37.543
No. I don't.

251
00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:39.753
He's right.

252
00:14:39.837 --> 00:14:42.214
Just bend your knees.
Loosen up. You'll get it.

253
00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:43.632
You know how to skate?

254
00:14:45.092 --> 00:14:46.594
I might know a thing or two.

255
00:14:49.263 --> 00:14:50.222
Some meeting.

256
00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:55.060
I really hope your client's bid wins. Val.

257
00:14:55.144 --> 00:14:55.978
Yeah.

258
00:14:56.604 --> 00:14:58.480
Still no word from Baldwyn Wines.

259
00:14:58.564 --> 00:14:59.440
Really odd.

260
00:15:00.649 --> 00:15:02.234
Maybe they're just not interested.

261
00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:03.569
Let's hope so.

262
00:15:03.652 --> 00:15:05.154
Just like this. okay?

263
00:15:05.237 --> 00:15:08.824
So you maybe want to grab dinner?
We can discuss where this all stands.

264
00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:11.410
Not tonight. Larry.

265
00:15:12.536 --> 00:15:14.872
- Rain check?
- Sure. Sounds good.

266
00:15:20.544 --> 00:15:22.254
Okay. guys. watch this one.

267
00:15:27.176 --> 00:15:28.135
Whoa!

268
00:15:28.218 --> 00:15:30.387
Cool! That was awesome!

269
00:15:31.221 --> 00:15:32.097
It's not that hard.

270
00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:33.515
Give it a shot.

271
00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:36.226
No way you could do that.

272
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:37.853
I see you've met my boys.

273
00:15:38.896 --> 00:15:40.272
Oh. these guys are yours?

274
00:15:41.148 --> 00:15:42.149
They sure are.

275
00:15:43.442 --> 00:15:44.443
Valentina.

276
00:15:44.526 --> 00:15:46.820
I'm Carter... Goodman.

277
00:15:47.321 --> 00:15:48.614
You have kids?

278
00:15:48.697 --> 00:15:49.865
No. no.

279
00:15:50.366 --> 00:15:52.868
I'm accused
of being one sometimes. though. Yeah.

280
00:15:53.369 --> 00:15:56.246
What brings you to Los Santos.
Carter Goodman?

281
00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.290
I'm... I'm scouting.

282
00:15:58.374 --> 00:16:01.460
Uh. because I live in the city.

283
00:16:02.461 --> 00:16:04.463
and I'm... I don't like it.

284
00:16:04.546 --> 00:16:06.048
I'd like to get out of the city.

285
00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:08.050
And so now I'm here. and I'm...

286
00:16:08.133 --> 00:16:11.011
I'm seeing how I vibe with the place.
If it works for me. you know?

287
00:16:11.095 --> 00:16:12.096
Oh.

288
00:16:12.179 --> 00:16:14.014
Well. I happen to be in real estate.

289
00:16:14.098 --> 00:16:19.186
So if you decide it's awesome here.
which I'm sure you will.

290
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:21.647
I would love to help you
find a place to live.

291
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:23.732
Oh. so you're like a...

292
00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:24.984
You're showing the vineyard.

293
00:16:25.067 --> 00:16:27.861
Yes. It just got on the market.

294
00:16:28.445 --> 00:16:29.279
Huh.

295
00:16:29.947 --> 00:16:30.906
Do you. uh...

296
00:16:31.407 --> 00:16:33.242
Do you think it will sell for a lot?

297
00:16:33.867 --> 00:16:36.036
Why? Are you trying to buy a vineyard?

298
00:16:36.704 --> 00:16:38.998
Me? Oh no.

299
00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:40.541
Oh God. no. No.

300
00:16:40.624 --> 00:16:43.794
What? Before. like. uh. what?
Before I buy my private plane?

301
00:16:46.714 --> 00:16:47.589
What do you do?

302
00:16:48.882 --> 00:16:50.092
I...

303
00:16:51.468 --> 00:16:52.970
I'm a carpenter.

304
00:16:53.846 --> 00:16:54.888
Like Jesus?

305
00:16:54.972 --> 00:16:55.806
Yep.

306
00:16:55.889 --> 00:16:57.850
I thought Jesus was a fisherman.

307
00:16:57.933 --> 00:17:00.602
You know. it was probably
a gig economy back then.

308
00:17:01.186 --> 00:17:04.732
So. uh. can you do. like. handyman stuff?

309
00:17:05.649 --> 00:17:06.734
Oh yeah.

310
00:17:06.817 --> 00:17:09.570
Yeah. I can do all
the handy carpentry things.

311
00:17:10.154 --> 00:17:11.113
Oh.

312
00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:15.826
- Watch...
- Where are you staying while in town?

313
00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:20.122
At the. uh... What was it?
The Crumbly Cork Motel.

314
00:17:22.166 --> 00:17:23.542
Are you also a drug dealer?

315
00:17:23.625 --> 00:17:24.752
What. is it that bad?

316
00:17:29.423 --> 00:17:31.967
Would you at all be interested in a trade?

317
00:17:32.634 --> 00:17:36.180
I actually have a guesthouse
that needs work.

318
00:17:36.805 --> 00:17:37.806
Is that so?

319
00:17:38.474 --> 00:17:40.726
If you have the time.

320
00:17:41.351 --> 00:17:43.854
Yes!

321
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.190
You could do
the work it needs.

322
00:17:46.273 --> 00:17:48.859
and I'll let you stay the week for free.

323
00:17:51.653 --> 00:17:53.489
This is a cute house.

324
00:17:53.572 --> 00:17:54.740
Thank you.

325
00:17:54.823 --> 00:17:56.408
And that is your project.

326
00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:03.123
I have to take this.

327
00:18:03.207 --> 00:18:04.374
Okay.

328
00:18:04.458 --> 00:18:06.543
Can you boys show him the guesthouse?

329
00:18:06.627 --> 00:18:07.544
- Yep.
- Yeah?

330
00:18:08.337 --> 00:18:09.546
I'll be right with you.

331
00:18:14.134 --> 00:18:17.262
- Oh. no door. Okay.
- Isn't that why you're here?

332
00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:19.598
What happened to my Legos?

333
00:18:19.681 --> 00:18:20.516
Sorry.

334
00:18:20.599 --> 00:18:22.976
Fernando. come on.
I worked on that for three days.

335
00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.478
Do you guys need a minute?

336
00:18:24.561 --> 00:18:26.438
He'll be fine. Come on.

337
00:18:30.776 --> 00:18:31.652
Here it is.

338
00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:39.326
Bed is right there.
and the bathroom is through that door.

339
00:18:40.786 --> 00:18:42.871
You know.
your wall could use a little more...

340
00:18:43.872 --> 00:18:44.748
wall.

341
00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:47.167
Are you really a carpenter?

342
00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:48.710
I have many skills.

343
00:18:50.045 --> 00:18:50.963
Want me to hang around?

344
00:18:51.046 --> 00:18:52.422
No. I really don't.

345
00:18:52.506 --> 00:18:53.423
Fine.

346
00:19:00.848 --> 00:19:03.725
Blending in hard. Carter.

347
00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:55.485
Hmm.

348
00:20:03.493 --> 00:20:04.453
Mr. Goodman?

349
00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:13.712
Hello?

350
00:20:14.254 --> 00:20:15.255
Uh. one sec!

351
00:20:16.673 --> 00:20:17.966
I'm coming. One... Jesus.

352
00:20:20.636 --> 00:20:22.930
Hey. my alarm was just about to go off.

353
00:20:23.597 --> 00:20:25.515
What is it. like. 9:00? 10:00?

354
00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:26.433
8:30.

355
00:20:26.516 --> 00:20:29.144
Wow. Getting a jump on the day. huh?

356
00:20:29.228 --> 00:20:32.648
I'm so sorry. I will bring you
something warmer for your bed.

357
00:20:32.731 --> 00:20:34.650
Oh. that would be great.

358
00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:35.859
Thank you.

359
00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:38.528
I'm gonna go meet up with some clients.

360
00:20:38.612 --> 00:20:40.447
Oh. about the winery?

361
00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:45.285
No. just regular people
looking for regular houses.

362
00:20:46.078 --> 00:20:49.039
Why? You need me to bring you some wine?

363
00:20:49.623 --> 00:20:51.124
Need? No.

364
00:20:51.208 --> 00:20:53.543
But I have learned
to never say no to wine.

365
00:20:54.294 --> 00:20:55.671
I'll see what I can do.

366
00:20:58.715 --> 00:21:02.177
Uh. in the meantime.
uh. if you wanted to get started in here.

367
00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:05.305
I already paid for the drywall
at the Walker Hardware.

368
00:21:05.389 --> 00:21:07.474
This is the address and phone number.

369
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.102
And the order's under Espinoza.

370
00:21:12.145 --> 00:21:13.146
Espinoza?

371
00:21:13.981 --> 00:21:15.065
I like that.

372
00:21:16.275 --> 00:21:17.234
Good.

373
00:21:17.317 --> 00:21:18.193
I'm stuck with it.

374
00:21:18.277 --> 00:21:21.571
Right. I mean. you can't just change
your last name on a whim.

375
00:21:22.489 --> 00:21:23.991
I mean. I did when I got married.

376
00:21:24.074 --> 00:21:26.660
That is one way to do it.

377
00:21:29.037 --> 00:21:31.581
Okay. so I will leave you to it.

378
00:21:31.665 --> 00:21:32.791
Roger that.

379
00:21:35.877 --> 00:21:38.588
You can't change your last name.
Stupid idiot.

380
00:22:03.405 --> 00:22:04.865
You look lost. young buck.

381
00:22:07.784 --> 00:22:09.453
Uh...

382
00:22:09.536 --> 00:22:13.498
I'm here to pick up an order for Espinoza.

383
00:22:15.042 --> 00:22:15.959
It's out back.

384
00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.086
You the contractor?

385
00:22:19.338 --> 00:22:20.255
Uh-huh.

386
00:22:22.591 --> 00:22:23.508
Mm-hmm.

387
00:22:24.426 --> 00:22:25.260
Come on.

388
00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.846
What's your name. son?

389
00:22:29.389 --> 00:22:30.349
Uh. Carter.

390
00:22:30.932 --> 00:22:32.559
Moe. Nice to meet you.

391
00:22:33.101 --> 00:22:34.102
Nice to meet you.

392
00:22:42.235 --> 00:22:44.071
All right. Here's Val's order.

393
00:22:44.154 --> 00:22:45.447
So. uh. which truck is yours?

394
00:22:49.534 --> 00:22:50.369
Uh...

395
00:22:51.745 --> 00:22:52.746
that one.

396
00:22:54.831 --> 00:22:56.875
It's because my truck
is in the shop right now.

397
00:22:56.958 --> 00:22:58.502
It's getting a. uh...

398
00:22:58.585 --> 00:23:00.962
a gun rack. A gun rack put in it.

399
00:23:01.046 --> 00:23:01.880
Uh-huh.

400
00:23:03.006 --> 00:23:05.509
I'll tell you what. Carter.
I'll drop it off for you.

401
00:23:05.592 --> 00:23:07.386
Val's place is on my way home.

402
00:23:08.095 --> 00:23:09.096
- Really?
- Yeah.

403
00:23:09.179 --> 00:23:11.181
That would be great. Thank you.

404
00:23:11.264 --> 00:23:14.309
You know. when I was your age.
I may have exaggerated

405
00:23:14.393 --> 00:23:17.562
a special skill a time or two
to impress a beautiful woman. so...

406
00:23:19.022 --> 00:23:20.065
You catch on quick.

407
00:23:20.148 --> 00:23:24.152
I almost drowned one time trying
to impress Lola Parker.

408
00:23:24.236 --> 00:23:26.696
- But you're lucky. young buck.
- Why is that?

409
00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.281
Drywall shouldn't be fatal.

410
00:23:28.365 --> 00:23:30.534
But I suggest you go on the internet
as soon as possible

411
00:23:30.617 --> 00:23:32.869
before you end up
sealing yourself inside a wall.

412
00:23:32.953 --> 00:23:34.371
Uh. it's a good tip.

413
00:23:34.454 --> 00:23:35.288
Thanks.

414
00:23:42.921 --> 00:23:44.589
Are you breaking bad. Moe?

415
00:23:46.007 --> 00:23:47.175
No. I'm a <i>garagiste.</i>

416
00:23:48.135 --> 00:23:49.136
You're a French mechanic?

417
00:23:49.803 --> 00:23:51.096
It has another meaning.

418
00:23:51.179 --> 00:23:52.681
Come on. Let me show you.

419
00:23:56.977 --> 00:23:58.186
It's for winemaking.

420
00:23:59.187 --> 00:24:00.272
In a garage?

421
00:24:00.772 --> 00:24:01.606
Yeah.

422
00:24:02.524 --> 00:24:03.984
Do you know anything about wine?

423
00:24:04.651 --> 00:24:05.569
A little bit.

424
00:24:06.736 --> 00:24:08.280
Like you know drywall?

425
00:24:08.864 --> 00:24:10.615
No. I actually have a pretty good nose.

426
00:24:10.699 --> 00:24:11.741
Really?

427
00:24:11.825 --> 00:24:12.909
Well. then.

428
00:24:15.537 --> 00:24:17.539
My friend. let's see here.

429
00:24:20.333 --> 00:24:22.794
This is the latest from my label.

430
00:24:24.588 --> 00:24:26.006
"Bottled by Moe Walker."

431
00:24:29.968 --> 00:24:31.136
Tell me what you think.

432
00:24:50.572 --> 00:24:51.698
What year is this?

433
00:24:51.781 --> 00:24:52.699
Last week.

434
00:24:53.742 --> 00:24:55.160
Probably needs some time to open up.

435
00:24:55.243 --> 00:24:56.828
Yeah. about a century.

436
00:24:56.912 --> 00:24:59.789
Okay. but what do you taste?

437
00:25:02.209 --> 00:25:05.420
I mean. there's... there's notes
of hibiscus and cherry.

438
00:25:05.504 --> 00:25:08.173
but mostly it is horse crap.

439
00:25:09.257 --> 00:25:10.383
Eh. it happens.

440
00:25:10.467 --> 00:25:13.428
But the cherry and hibiscus was spot-on.
Man. I'm impressed.

441
00:25:14.304 --> 00:25:15.305
That makes one of us.

442
00:25:15.388 --> 00:25:16.306
- What's that?
- Hmm?

443
00:25:16.389 --> 00:25:19.226
You know. I just love the old technique
of winemaking.

444
00:25:19.309 --> 00:25:20.852
You know? Something romantic about it.

445
00:25:20.936 --> 00:25:22.687
Once in a while. I crack the code.

446
00:25:23.188 --> 00:25:24.814
Maybe I could have you try some others.

447
00:25:24.898 --> 00:25:26.525
Oh. you don't have to do that.

448
00:25:27.442 --> 00:25:28.818
You want help with that drywall?

449
00:25:34.366 --> 00:25:36.952
You drop off the supplies.
and then the next time I'm here...

450
00:25:38.203 --> 00:25:41.331
...I will be emotionally ready
for another dose.

451
00:25:41.414 --> 00:25:43.208
Square deal.

452
00:25:49.089 --> 00:25:50.840
Oh. am I gonna need some tools?

453
00:25:57.931 --> 00:26:01.309
<i>- âª I'm letting you go âª</i>

454
00:26:01.977 --> 00:26:05.689
<i>âª 'Cause you'll never get the best of me âª</i>

455
00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.034
Mother.

456
00:26:18.618 --> 00:26:20.704
<i>Society as a whole
has decided that texting</i>

457
00:26:20.787 --> 00:26:22.998
<i>is the preferred mode of communication.</i>

458
00:26:23.081 --> 00:26:24.749
Texting is crude.

459
00:26:24.833 --> 00:26:28.336
There's a reason they invented
the telephone after the telegraph.

460
00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:32.674
Yes. but autocorrect and the misuse
of emoticons by the elderly

461
00:26:33.174 --> 00:26:35.051
provides constant family entertainment.

462
00:26:35.135 --> 00:26:36.052
Very funny.

463
00:26:36.553 --> 00:26:37.971
Have you made any progress?

464
00:26:38.054 --> 00:26:39.472
<i>Mom. I've got this.</i>

465
00:26:40.015 --> 00:26:42.475
It turns out there are
a bunch of potential bidders.

466
00:26:42.559 --> 00:26:45.020
but I figured out a way
to find the highest bid.

467
00:26:45.103 --> 00:26:46.313
And what's that?

468
00:26:46.396 --> 00:26:49.149
I'm staying at the house
of the realtor in charge of it.

469
00:26:50.775 --> 00:26:53.403
- How are you possibly staying--
- Hey. I gotta go. Call you back.

470
00:27:12.631 --> 00:27:13.965
Mr. Carter?

471
00:27:16.635 --> 00:27:19.054
Aren't you supposed to be working
or something?

472
00:27:23.391 --> 00:27:24.726
It's called self-care.

473
00:27:24.809 --> 00:27:27.270
Kid. this is how grown-ups like me

474
00:27:28.146 --> 00:27:30.523
stay at levels of peak performance.

475
00:27:30.607 --> 00:27:33.234
You're not like a normal grown-up.

476
00:27:33.985 --> 00:27:36.321
Aw. Thank you.

477
00:27:36.404 --> 00:27:39.199
What's with the snowboard?
Did you already give up on skateboarding?

478
00:27:40.075 --> 00:27:43.578
My dad gave snowboards to me and Fer
for Christmas a couple years ago.

479
00:27:43.662 --> 00:27:46.956
We were supposed to go on a trip to Tahoe.
but we never did.

480
00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.376
Mom says we might be able to go this year.

481
00:27:49.459 --> 00:27:51.169
I wanted to figure out how to use it.

482
00:27:52.671 --> 00:27:55.840
I don't want to suck at everything.
Fer's good at everything.

483
00:27:55.924 --> 00:27:58.510
Okay. well.
I'm sure your dad just got really busy.

484
00:27:59.094 --> 00:28:00.637
I bet you he takes you this year.

485
00:28:01.971 --> 00:28:03.348
He didn't get busy.

486
00:28:05.308 --> 00:28:06.393
He died.

487
00:28:15.568 --> 00:28:16.403
Um...

488
00:28:19.489 --> 00:28:21.950
I'm... I'm really sorry.

489
00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:23.410
I didn't know.

490
00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:24.869
It's okay.

491
00:28:29.374 --> 00:28:32.961
You know.
my dad died when I was little too.

492
00:28:36.256 --> 00:28:37.507
So I know what it's like.

493
00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:45.098
But it gets easier.

494
00:28:46.725 --> 00:28:48.143
And it makes you stronger.

495
00:28:49.227 --> 00:28:51.104
So you're stronger?

496
00:28:54.232 --> 00:28:55.108
You bet.

497
00:28:55.817 --> 00:28:57.819
So. snowboarding.

498
00:28:57.902 --> 00:29:00.405
Huh? I mean. it's... it's pretty easy.

499
00:29:00.488 --> 00:29:01.448
I can teach you.

500
00:29:01.531 --> 00:29:03.616
- You snowboard too?
- Yeah.

501
00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:05.618
Well. I prefer skiing.

502
00:29:05.702 --> 00:29:06.703
Did your dad have a board?

503
00:29:06.786 --> 00:29:07.912
It's in the shed.

504
00:29:08.455 --> 00:29:09.581
Well. let's go get it.

505
00:29:10.165 --> 00:29:11.124
We can practice.

506
00:29:12.584 --> 00:29:15.170
- Here in the yard?
- You gotta get to know your board.

507
00:29:15.795 --> 00:29:17.797
This is as good of a place as any.

508
00:29:17.881 --> 00:29:18.882
It is?

509
00:29:20.216 --> 00:29:21.718
Bring your butt forward.

510
00:29:22.469 --> 00:29:23.762
And see if you can...

511
00:29:27.348 --> 00:29:28.641
Okay. You're up.

512
00:29:28.725 --> 00:29:30.226
Lean in to your heels.

513
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:32.645
That's how you're gonna turn.

514
00:29:32.729 --> 00:29:34.814
it's how you'll slow down.
it's how you'll stop.

515
00:29:34.898 --> 00:29:37.192
You're just learning the board.
understanding how it works.

516
00:29:37.275 --> 00:29:38.818
So do that a couple times.

517
00:29:39.652 --> 00:29:41.154
Rock and hold it.

518
00:29:42.071 --> 00:29:44.199
You gotta stop.
There's a skier right in front of you.

519
00:29:44.282 --> 00:29:46.201
Stop. stop. stop. stop. stop! Ah!

520
00:29:46.284 --> 00:29:47.827
That's okay. Good job.

521
00:29:47.911 --> 00:29:48.870
You got it. kid.

522
00:29:50.705 --> 00:29:52.624
It's all a part of it. Good job.

523
00:29:53.833 --> 00:29:54.959
That's it. You got it.

524
00:29:55.043 --> 00:29:56.753
- Oh!
- Whoa!

525
00:29:56.836 --> 00:29:58.379
And come towards me a little bit.

526
00:29:59.881 --> 00:30:00.715
There you go.

527
00:30:01.216 --> 00:30:02.759
You're a natural. man.

528
00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:05.178
Rock forward.

529
00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:06.805
Ooh!

530
00:30:06.888 --> 00:30:09.057
All right. now... now see
how long you can hold it.

531
00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:11.351
Yeah!

532
00:30:12.018 --> 00:30:13.019
Now lean forward.

533
00:30:13.561 --> 00:30:15.605
- You got it. Lean forward a little more.
- Ah!

534
00:30:17.232 --> 00:30:19.984
One more time. One more time.
Bend your knees. center of gravity.

535
00:30:20.068 --> 00:30:22.654
You're gonna turn the board.
You turn and find that edge.

536
00:30:27.158 --> 00:30:28.034
Hey. guys.

537
00:30:28.117 --> 00:30:29.410
Oh. hey. Moe.

538
00:30:30.328 --> 00:30:31.913
Got your tools and your drywall.

539
00:30:31.996 --> 00:30:32.831
Right.

540
00:30:33.623 --> 00:30:35.792
Um. you keep working on this.

541
00:30:35.875 --> 00:30:38.294
and we'll hit it again tomorrow.
How's that sound?

542
00:30:39.003 --> 00:30:39.838
Okay.

543
00:30:43.216 --> 00:30:44.634
I'll be right there. Moe.

544
00:30:44.717 --> 00:30:46.094
Thanks. Mr. Carter.

545
00:30:46.678 --> 00:30:49.556
All right. so not a lot of cut-outs.
So shouldn't be too tricky.

546
00:30:50.056 --> 00:30:51.933
And as I'm sure you know.

547
00:30:52.016 --> 00:30:54.477
you want to install drywall
from the top down.

548
00:30:54.561 --> 00:30:58.439
Right. Top down. The. uh... The usual way.

549
00:30:58.523 --> 00:30:59.357
Carter.

550
00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:02.902
Top down. I got it. Thank you.

551
00:31:03.653 --> 00:31:05.280
Would you like me to help you with this?

552
00:31:06.364 --> 00:31:07.699
What? No.

553
00:31:07.782 --> 00:31:12.412
I know how to build a wall. Moe.
I did my internet research.

554
00:31:14.414 --> 00:31:15.248
Okay.

555
00:31:18.042 --> 00:31:20.211
And have you thought
about installing doors?

556
00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.299
Oh yeah. I should do that.

557
00:31:28.094 --> 00:31:29.512
Okay. young buck. Good luck.

558
00:31:38.563 --> 00:31:39.856
I can do this.

559
00:31:43.401 --> 00:31:44.861
It's not light.

560
00:31:50.283 --> 00:31:52.619

579
00:33:00.979 --> 00:33:02.021
I can't do this.

580
00:33:15.535 --> 00:33:17.912
Oh! Okay.

581
00:33:18.705 --> 00:33:20.915
Okay...

582
00:33:33.261 --> 00:33:34.804
Knock. knock.

583
00:33:35.555 --> 00:33:36.681
Oh. hey!

584
00:33:36.764 --> 00:33:37.932
Oh. hey. Hey.

585
00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:41.019
I... I came to check on you.

586
00:33:42.395 --> 00:33:44.981
Oh yeah.
No. I'm. uh. all good here.

587
00:33:45.064 --> 00:33:47.066
I'm just planning tomorrow's work.

588
00:33:48.818 --> 00:33:49.861
How was your day?

589
00:33:50.445 --> 00:33:52.655
Any... Any offers on any good houses or...

590
00:33:53.823 --> 00:33:54.657
vineyards?

591
00:33:54.741 --> 00:33:57.035
Uh. no. no. It was just. uh...

592
00:33:57.118 --> 00:33:59.579
Uh. showings back-to-back.

593
00:34:00.413 --> 00:34:01.247
All day.

594
00:34:05.418 --> 00:34:07.253
I'm gonna put on a shirt.

595
00:34:10.006 --> 00:34:11.340
Ow!

596
00:34:12.258 --> 00:34:13.676
What happened to your finger?

597
00:34:14.343 --> 00:34:17.263
Oh. this? It's nothing.
It comes with the job.

598
00:34:24.812 --> 00:34:27.565
You know. we could move
some boxes to the garage

599
00:34:27.648 --> 00:34:29.984
to give you some more space in here.

600
00:34:32.195 --> 00:34:33.196
Cool.

601
00:34:33.279 --> 00:34:34.113
Yeah.

602
00:34:34.697 --> 00:34:36.699
Watch your step.

603
00:34:36.783 --> 00:34:37.617
Ah...

604
00:34:38.242 --> 00:34:40.620
Oh. here. It's fine.

605
00:34:45.958 --> 00:34:46.959
What's all this?

606
00:34:48.836 --> 00:34:50.379
Oh. This. uh...

607
00:34:52.965 --> 00:34:54.175
was my husband's.

608
00:34:55.927 --> 00:34:59.430
Uh. listen. Santi told me
that he passed away.

609
00:34:59.514 --> 00:35:01.349
And. uh. I'm really sorry.

610
00:35:01.974 --> 00:35:02.809
Thanks.

611
00:35:04.477 --> 00:35:09.398
The guesthouse was supposed to house
all of his wine memorabilia.

612
00:35:09.482 --> 00:35:12.443
but I could really use
the rental income now.

613
00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:19.075
Do you know how old this thing is?

614
00:35:19.826 --> 00:35:21.035
Only he would know.

615
00:35:22.161 --> 00:35:24.163
But his main interest...

616
00:35:27.333 --> 00:35:29.502
Whoa. what are those?

617
00:35:29.585 --> 00:35:32.755
Are you familiar
with our local <i>garagiste</i> wine culture?

618
00:35:34.298 --> 00:35:35.883
I know a little something about it.

619
00:35:35.967 --> 00:35:37.385
Chris loved it.

620
00:35:37.468 --> 00:35:41.347
He collected and tried all of the wines.

621
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:42.348
Oh.

622
00:35:42.431 --> 00:35:45.852
He truly believed good wine
could come out of this valley.

623
00:35:46.477 --> 00:35:50.148
All the grapes go to Baldwyn Wines
for their cheap stuff.

624
00:35:50.898 --> 00:35:53.484
I don't know if any of these are good.

625
00:35:53.568 --> 00:35:55.319
I'm just a casual drinker.

626
00:35:56.487 --> 00:35:57.822
Chris was the dreamer.

627
00:36:01.117 --> 00:36:03.703
Were the grapes from these wines
locally sourced?

628
00:36:03.786 --> 00:36:06.330
All from Huckabee Vineyard.

629
00:36:06.414 --> 00:36:08.249
Oh. that. uh... that makes sense.

630
00:36:08.332 --> 00:36:11.085
Seemed like there were
a lot of interested buyers.

631
00:36:11.794 --> 00:36:15.339
Yeah. I thought Baldwyn Wines
was going to be very interested.

632
00:36:15.423 --> 00:36:17.258
but we haven't heard from them.

633
00:36:17.341 --> 00:36:18.176
Huh.

634
00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:21.012
Hey. Val!

635
00:36:21.512 --> 00:36:22.680
Oh.

636
00:36:23.181 --> 00:36:24.932
Who is this?

637
00:36:25.016 --> 00:36:27.268
Cindy. this is Carter.

638
00:36:27.351 --> 00:36:28.978
Carter. this is my friend Cindy.

639
00:36:29.061 --> 00:36:31.814
Oh. you did not tell me you were dating.

640
00:36:31.898 --> 00:36:34.317
No! No. we're not dating.

641
00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.276
It's a shame.

642
00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:36.736
Stunning couple.

643
00:36:36.819 --> 00:36:40.156
Um. Carter is helping me fix
the guesthouse.

644
00:36:40.239 --> 00:36:41.407
Is he now?

645
00:36:42.158 --> 00:36:44.994
Hot handyman in the guesthouse.
I've seen that movie.

646
00:36:45.077 --> 00:36:46.204
- Cindy.
- Yes?

647
00:36:46.287 --> 00:36:47.997
- He can hear you.
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

648
00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:51.334
Uh. we have planned
a little girls night for tonight.

649
00:36:52.084 --> 00:36:54.420
- Well. I'll let you guys get to it.
- Okay.

650
00:36:54.503 --> 00:36:56.339
I'm feeling
a little objectified right now.

651
00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:00.509
Mmm.

652
00:37:00.593 --> 00:37:01.761
Bye. Carter!

653
00:37:03.095 --> 00:37:04.013
Lock that down.

654
00:37:04.096 --> 00:37:06.515
Listen. uh. brought a bottle of wine
from my neighbor Maria.

655
00:37:06.599 --> 00:37:08.059
It's her entry for the wine festival.

656
00:37:08.142 --> 00:37:12.313
And we can share it while you tell me
why his shirt was on inside out. okay?

657
00:37:21.948 --> 00:37:23.366
I should've got two bottles.

658
00:37:23.866 --> 00:37:25.660
That is such a rookie mistake.

659
00:37:26.535 --> 00:37:27.787
I can go to the garage...

660
00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:29.205
- Huh.
- Or...

661
00:37:29.288 --> 00:37:32.333
I have a Bargain Barrel Baldwyn.

662
00:37:32.416 --> 00:37:33.709
Ew. gross.

663
00:37:33.793 --> 00:37:35.419
Sleeping with the enemy?

664
00:37:35.503 --> 00:37:37.588
- It's so cheap.
- I know.

665
00:37:40.549 --> 00:37:44.053
I wonder if. uh. Carter has any wine.

666
00:37:44.762 --> 00:37:45.721
He could come over.

667
00:37:45.805 --> 00:37:46.931
We could share it.

668
00:37:47.014 --> 00:37:48.266
- No.
- Why not?

669
00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:49.350
He's so hot.

670
00:37:49.433 --> 00:37:52.019
He's probably busy working.

671
00:37:52.103 --> 00:37:53.854
Uh-huh. Is that it?

672
00:37:53.938 --> 00:37:57.733
Or are you worried that Larry.
your banker friend. might get jealous?

673
00:37:57.817 --> 00:37:59.652
- Oh stop.
- What?

674
00:37:59.735 --> 00:38:02.196
Come on. You have all these hot guys
throwing themselves at you.

675
00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.407
I think it is time you catch one.

676
00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:05.658
No.

677
00:38:06.284 --> 00:38:10.871
I can't even imagine what the kids
would think if they see me--

678
00:38:10.955 --> 00:38:14.625
What? Happy? Dancing again?

679
00:38:14.709 --> 00:38:17.503
Girl. I have not seen you shake
them Espinoza hips in forever.

680
00:38:18.504 --> 00:38:21.048
Yeah. I haven't been feeling
like dancing much lately.

681
00:38:21.132 --> 00:38:23.134
Oh. honey.

682
00:38:23.217 --> 00:38:24.844
We may never get bliss.

683
00:38:25.636 --> 00:38:27.471
but every once in a while.

684
00:38:28.264 --> 00:38:29.724
a kiss can do wonders.

685
00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:33.602
No. the boys have been through enough.

686
00:38:33.686 --> 00:38:34.520
So what?

687
00:38:34.603 --> 00:38:37.356
Valentina Espinoza's
just done taking chances?

688
00:38:38.733 --> 00:38:40.067
I'm not fun like you.

689
00:38:40.151 --> 00:38:41.235
Oh. girl.

690
00:38:41.319 --> 00:38:44.947
You can learn to do anything in life.
even how to loosen up.

691
00:38:45.031 --> 00:38:48.826
You know. I did not always put
the "sin" in Cindy.

692
00:38:50.286 --> 00:38:51.370
Ugh.

693
00:38:51.454 --> 00:38:55.166
I was so focused on getting through
nursing school as fast as I could

694
00:38:55.249 --> 00:38:56.667
I didn't even party in college.

695
00:38:56.751 --> 00:38:58.627
Like ever.

696
00:38:58.711 --> 00:38:59.545
But...

697
00:39:01.422 --> 00:39:02.340
I don't know.

698
00:39:03.174 --> 00:39:04.133
Being a nurse.

699
00:39:05.134 --> 00:39:05.968
I just...

700
00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:10.681
I see so many lives at the end. you know?

701
00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:15.186
And I just realized I wasn't living mine.

702
00:39:16.771 --> 00:39:20.232
So if you don't go knock on Carter's door.
maybe I will.

703
00:39:20.316 --> 00:39:21.609
Hey. back off!

704
00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.076
I just...

705
00:39:34.872 --> 00:39:35.790
Mmm.

706
00:39:39.126 --> 00:39:41.003
I just don't know if I'm ready.

707
00:39:42.088 --> 00:39:44.090
It's only been a couple of years.

708
00:39:49.011 --> 00:39:53.099
You know. when Chris was. um.
coming in to get his chemo treatments.

709
00:39:55.684 --> 00:39:58.687
all he did was talk
about you and the boys.

710
00:40:00.523 --> 00:40:03.275
He just wanted you to be happy. Valentina.

711
00:40:12.451 --> 00:40:14.453
I really thought we had more time.

712
00:40:15.079 --> 00:40:16.914
I know. honey. I'm sorry.

713
00:40:18.374 --> 00:40:19.500
Time sucks.

714
00:40:21.419 --> 00:40:22.253
Yup.

715
00:40:24.463 --> 00:40:25.297
It does.

716
00:40:27.633 --> 00:40:28.717
But that is why

717
00:40:30.344 --> 00:40:31.887
you have to steal from it.

718
00:40:32.972 --> 00:40:34.390
Every day you can.

719
00:40:58.706 --> 00:40:59.623
Ooh.

720
00:41:16.223 --> 00:41:18.392
- Take it easy.
- You too.

721
00:41:21.228 --> 00:41:23.981
Oh. he's alive.

722
00:41:24.064 --> 00:41:26.775
You know. I was sure
you were gonna electrocute yourself.

723
00:41:27.443 --> 00:41:29.361
Wait. what? I <i>can</i> die doing this?

724
00:41:30.446 --> 00:41:31.989
What's up?
You. uh... You need more tools?

725
00:41:32.072 --> 00:41:35.951
- Uh. actually. I... I need more drywall.
- Huh.

726
00:41:36.035 --> 00:41:38.287
- I need to redo some of it.
- Okay.

727
00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:40.122
We can definitely get you resupplied.

728
00:41:41.582 --> 00:41:43.000
And I need some doors.

729
00:41:43.709 --> 00:41:45.920
Is there any chance
that you took measurements?

730
00:41:46.003 --> 00:41:47.588
I did! I did.

731
00:41:47.671 --> 00:41:52.468
I saw a video that you need to do that
so you know that they. um... that they fit.

732
00:41:53.093 --> 00:41:53.928
Hmm.

733
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:55.304
Mm-hmm.

734
00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:59.475
Also.

735
00:41:59.558 --> 00:42:01.018
I could use some help.

736
00:42:01.101 --> 00:42:02.937
if you have the time.

737
00:42:05.064 --> 00:42:07.483
You have time
to taste more wine?

738
00:42:10.861 --> 00:42:14.240
Okay. now that last one
might've had some bad breath...

739
00:42:14.323 --> 00:42:15.157
You think?

740
00:42:15.241 --> 00:42:19.662
Okay. it did have a little barnyard in it.
but try this one.

741
00:42:34.385 --> 00:42:36.887
We ought to get you a bucket for that.

742
00:42:36.971 --> 00:42:38.264
It's not quite there yet.

743
00:42:38.347 --> 00:42:40.182
Okay. okay. details. I need details.

744
00:42:47.064 --> 00:42:48.774
Okay. no horse crap.

745
00:42:48.857 --> 00:42:50.317
Hmm. okay.

746
00:42:50.401 --> 00:42:52.027
Good fruit. super grippy...

747
00:42:53.028 --> 00:42:54.738
...some austere tannins. though.

748
00:42:54.822 --> 00:42:56.740
Well. that's okay. It's whole cluster.

749
00:42:57.241 --> 00:42:59.618
Those tannins will soften.
Trust me.

750
00:43:01.203 --> 00:43:02.746
Look. no offense. Moe.

751
00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:05.541
but Los Santos grapes
aren't exactly known for tasting great.

752
00:43:05.624 --> 00:43:06.917
That is nonsense. okay?

753
00:43:07.001 --> 00:43:09.545
We just got a bad rap
because of Bargain Barrel Baldwyn.

754
00:43:10.212 --> 00:43:13.591
They're garbage winemakers
who took good soil and good fruit

755
00:43:13.674 --> 00:43:15.968
and homogenized it into bland.
overly sweet wine.

756
00:43:17.428 --> 00:43:18.637
Can't argue with that.

757
00:43:18.721 --> 00:43:20.472
It's all in the process.

758
00:43:20.556 --> 00:43:22.683
<i>In vino veritas</i>. my man.

759
00:43:23.767 --> 00:43:26.979
- I don't think that's what that means.
- Oh. let's try this one.

760
00:43:27.062 --> 00:43:30.482
Huh? I have to find my best blend
for the festivals.

761
00:43:30.566 --> 00:43:33.444
All right. um. one more.

762
00:43:33.527 --> 00:43:35.696
but then we gotta go back
to making a wall.

763
00:43:36.363 --> 00:43:37.197
Okay.

764
00:43:39.408 --> 00:43:40.826
Oh. that's gonna be good.

765
00:43:49.126 --> 00:43:50.711
No. no. no. Slide that to the left.

766
00:43:50.794 --> 00:43:52.671
We'll cut out another piece for the edge.

767
00:43:53.464 --> 00:43:55.007
But what about the outlet?

768
00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:56.133
Well. if you put it there.

769
00:43:56.216 --> 00:43:58.510
you'll mess up railroading
your butt joints.

770
00:43:59.136 --> 00:44:02.014
I haven't been warned about that
since Mr. Hoffman's Sex Ed class.

771
00:44:02.097 --> 00:44:04.433
Sounds like a wise man.

772
00:44:05.142 --> 00:44:06.602
Here. let me take some measurements.

773
00:44:13.901 --> 00:44:16.779
So do you get all your grapes
from the Huckabee Estates?

774
00:44:16.862 --> 00:44:18.781
Yeah. everyone around here does.

775
00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:22.868
And you just make the wine in your garage?

776
00:44:22.951 --> 00:44:24.119
No.

777
00:44:24.203 --> 00:44:26.288
I. um. experiment in my garage.

778
00:44:26.372 --> 00:44:27.623
But when I get serious.

779
00:44:27.706 --> 00:44:30.542
I use the facilities down
at the Huckabee Vineyard. We all do.

780
00:44:31.126 --> 00:44:33.921
So what's everyone gonna do
when someone buys the vineyard?

781
00:44:34.004 --> 00:44:36.048
Well. Val has a plan.

782
00:44:36.799 --> 00:44:37.633
Oh.

783
00:44:38.175 --> 00:44:40.052
She found a friendly buyer?

784
00:44:40.135 --> 00:44:41.095
Something like that.

785
00:44:41.178 --> 00:44:42.096
A collective.

786
00:44:42.596 --> 00:44:44.515
Huh.

787
00:44:48.185 --> 00:44:49.520
Oh. my three o'clock's here.

788
00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:51.522
Well. that's my cue.

789
00:44:52.398 --> 00:44:53.399
You put the doors in.

790
00:44:53.482 --> 00:44:55.484
We sure did. I'll be right there. Santi.

791
00:44:57.152 --> 00:44:59.780
Thank you again for helping me today.

792
00:45:00.322 --> 00:45:03.117
One who brings happiness
to others finds it.

793
00:45:03.701 --> 00:45:04.618
Is that Plato?

794
00:45:05.619 --> 00:45:06.954
I read it on a teabag.

795
00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:11.625
Toe... Put your weight on your toes.

796
00:45:12.418 --> 00:45:13.252
And then heel.

797
00:45:13.335 --> 00:45:16.296
So. eventually. when you turn.
you're gonna be... Weight in the toes...

798
00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:19.842
And that's gonna start
to turn the snowboard in the snow.

799
00:45:29.101 --> 00:45:31.061
I thought Val already had a handyman.

800
00:45:31.145 --> 00:45:32.688
Oh. yeah. she does.

801
00:45:33.605 --> 00:45:35.357
Yeah. I met him.

802
00:45:35.441 --> 00:45:37.818
Got more of a pool boy vibe.

803
00:45:37.901 --> 00:45:40.988
You may be on to something.
but you didn't hear it from me.

804
00:45:41.071 --> 00:45:42.865
I can tell you're the real thing.

805
00:45:42.948 --> 00:45:43.782
Hmm.

806
00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:50.789
Two. three... One. two...

807
00:45:50.873 --> 00:45:51.832
Jump!

808
00:45:52.458 --> 00:45:53.292
Good job.

809
00:45:53.959 --> 00:45:55.127
Aw. that's it!

810
00:45:56.795 --> 00:45:57.629
Hey. guys.

811
00:45:57.713 --> 00:45:58.672
Hi. Aunt Cindy.

812
00:45:58.756 --> 00:46:00.090
Hey.

813
00:46:02.926 --> 00:46:04.678
- Hey. Val.
- That's it!

814
00:46:04.762 --> 00:46:06.388
All right. here's what we're gonna do...

815
00:46:11.351 --> 00:46:13.687
What are you looking at?

816
00:46:13.771 --> 00:46:15.314
- Santi.
- Ready? One. two...

817
00:46:15.397 --> 00:46:19.234
It's kind of nice for him
to have a man around the house.

818
00:46:19.318 --> 00:46:20.694
- What's up?
- Uh-huh.

819
00:46:21.945 --> 00:46:24.698
- Okay. for me too.
- Oh. there it is.

820
00:46:24.782 --> 00:46:27.201
I just met a handyman in the driveway.

821
00:46:27.701 --> 00:46:28.827
That's Moe.

822
00:46:28.911 --> 00:46:30.204
He's helping Carter out.

823
00:46:30.287 --> 00:46:31.455
Oh.

824
00:46:31.538 --> 00:46:33.916
I could use a little handy work from Moe.

825
00:46:33.999 --> 00:46:35.793
- Cindy...
- Just saying.

826
00:46:35.876 --> 00:46:37.336
Mo' Moe. less problems.

827
00:46:37.419 --> 00:46:39.713
- Don't say that.
- I instantly regretted it.

828
00:46:40.464 --> 00:46:42.341
Nice work. man. Give me some.

829
00:46:45.219 --> 00:46:47.179
You're really getting the hang of this.

830
00:46:50.307 --> 00:46:52.100
Just got to get you in some snow.

831
00:46:52.768 --> 00:46:54.102
How are we gonna do that?

832
00:46:55.521 --> 00:46:57.481
I don't know. but I'll figure it out.

833
00:47:01.944 --> 00:47:04.363
Thanks. Mr. Carter.

834
00:47:22.339 --> 00:47:23.257
Hey. Moe.

835
00:47:26.134 --> 00:47:28.428
No. I am not calling
from inside of the wall.

836
00:47:29.054 --> 00:47:30.514
Look. I got a wild idea.

837
00:47:31.139 --> 00:47:32.432
What are you doing tomorrow?

838
00:47:55.122 --> 00:47:55.956
Uh...

839
00:48:00.586 --> 00:48:01.420
Sorry.

840
00:48:02.546 --> 00:48:05.799
I thought we could. um.
finish clearing things out.

841
00:48:07.217 --> 00:48:08.969
Uh. sure.

842
00:48:13.181 --> 00:48:14.600
Should I go like this?

843
00:48:15.767 --> 00:48:16.977
I'll leave it up to you.

844
00:48:18.562 --> 00:48:19.563
Give me two minutes.

845
00:48:24.318 --> 00:48:27.738
And I really think we should get
some window treatments in this guesthouse.

846
00:48:37.748 --> 00:48:40.584
I'm starting
to run out of space in here.

847
00:48:43.045 --> 00:48:44.671
Why don't you just get rid of these wines?

848
00:48:44.755 --> 00:48:48.091
It's not like any of them are gonna be
the next Chateau Cheval Blanc.

849
00:48:52.262 --> 00:48:54.014
Was that snootiness?

850
00:48:55.474 --> 00:48:56.600
Are you a wine snob?

851
00:48:56.683 --> 00:48:58.894
Me? No.

852
00:48:59.519 --> 00:49:00.437
N... No.

853
00:49:02.439 --> 00:49:03.273
A little.

854
00:49:04.983 --> 00:49:05.817
Okay. a lot.

855
00:49:06.902 --> 00:49:10.155
So. because they're made in a garage.
they can't be good?

856
00:49:10.697 --> 00:49:14.826
If they're made in a garage.
the chances are slim. Yeah.

857
00:49:15.911 --> 00:49:16.995
We're gonna try one.

858
00:49:17.913 --> 00:49:18.747
Are you sure?

859
00:49:19.247 --> 00:49:22.250
I mean.
they are your husband's wines. after all.

860
00:49:22.334 --> 00:49:25.212
But he collected them
so they could be enjoyed.

861
00:49:26.713 --> 00:49:27.881
We will enjoy it.

862
00:49:31.343 --> 00:49:32.803
"Pour decisions."

863
00:49:32.886 --> 00:49:34.346
It's a fitting name.

864
00:49:34.429 --> 00:49:35.472
Let's try it.

865
00:49:37.933 --> 00:49:38.850
Glasses.

866
00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:48.402
All right. here goes.

867
00:49:52.572 --> 00:49:54.616
Um. tastes like wine.

868
00:49:57.619 --> 00:50:00.414
Okay. uh. let's take a step back.

869
00:50:00.998 --> 00:50:02.207
See. I was taught...

870
00:50:02.708 --> 00:50:03.542
See?

871
00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:08.755
And then you're gonna swirl it.

872
00:50:10.966 --> 00:50:12.676
It's to open the aroma.

873
00:50:13.719 --> 00:50:14.636
Sniff...

874
00:50:22.185 --> 00:50:23.061
...and sip.

875
00:50:23.603 --> 00:50:25.439
Let it fall across your palate.

876
00:50:26.481 --> 00:50:27.983
and you savor the finish.

877
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:38.326
That actually doesn't suck.

878
00:50:40.996 --> 00:50:43.415
Okay. uh. you try.

879
00:50:45.751 --> 00:50:47.294
- See?
- Mm-hmm.

880
00:50:49.838 --> 00:50:50.672
Mmm.

881
00:50:50.756 --> 00:50:52.591
Swirl...

882
00:51:00.849 --> 00:51:02.517
Oh.

883
00:51:06.229 --> 00:51:07.064
Well?

884
00:51:07.856 --> 00:51:09.316
Still tastes like wine.

885
00:51:10.567 --> 00:51:12.444
Okay. but what else do you taste?

886
00:51:14.946 --> 00:51:16.656
- Cherry?
- Mm-hmm.

887
00:51:20.118 --> 00:51:20.952
Lavender?

888
00:51:21.036 --> 00:51:22.037
Good.

889
00:51:25.082 --> 00:51:26.083
Peanut butter crackers?

890
00:51:26.917 --> 00:51:29.544
- Wait. what?
- Oh. that's from my kid's lunch.

891
00:51:30.879 --> 00:51:33.048
Okay. no. no. no.
I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

892
00:51:39.179 --> 00:51:40.555
These grapes

893
00:51:40.639 --> 00:51:42.724
were picked on a humid Saturday.

894
00:51:43.517 --> 00:51:47.187
by a 73-year-old Frenchman
with a slight limp.

895
00:51:47.771 --> 00:51:51.691
who enjoys anchovies on his pizza...

896
00:51:51.775 --> 00:51:55.695
...a fact
that he hides from his wife.

897
00:51:55.779 --> 00:51:59.366
because she thinks
they're bad for his digestion.

898
00:52:01.118 --> 00:52:02.244
Wow.

899
00:52:02.327 --> 00:52:04.412
You have a... a very specific nose.

900
00:52:04.996 --> 00:52:07.958
No. you have a very specific nose.

901
00:52:10.418 --> 00:52:11.294
Sorry.

902
00:52:12.212 --> 00:52:16.842
I had a glass with Cindy.
and now I'm feeling your face.

903
00:52:16.925 --> 00:52:18.301
No. No. I. uh...

904
00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:21.847
I appreciate your honest appraisal.

905
00:52:24.182 --> 00:52:25.183
You see?

906
00:52:25.267 --> 00:52:27.853
Wine doesn't have to be fancy to be good.

907
00:52:27.936 --> 00:52:29.271
Okay. well. if they're so good.

908
00:52:29.354 --> 00:52:32.858
then why aren't they available at.
let's say. Whole Foods?

909
00:52:32.941 --> 00:52:36.319
Because it's not that easy
to get a wine label into stores.

910
00:52:36.403 --> 00:52:39.739
Especially when our grapes
get such a bad rep.

911
00:52:39.823 --> 00:52:42.200
Is it because of Bargain Barrel Baldwyn?

912
00:52:42.284 --> 00:52:43.160
Yes.

913
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:46.288
Which sometimes I drink.

914
00:52:46.371 --> 00:52:47.289
What?

915
00:52:48.081 --> 00:52:48.915
Why?

916
00:52:49.457 --> 00:52:52.419
Because sometimes it just hits the spot.

917
00:52:52.502 --> 00:52:54.212
- Hmm.
- Like Mac 'n' cheese.

918
00:52:56.256 --> 00:52:59.217
Wine was never meant
to be a class divider.

919
00:52:59.301 --> 00:53:02.596
Dionysus meant for it
to bring people together.

920
00:53:02.679 --> 00:53:04.431
to enjoy. and celebrate.

921
00:53:04.514 --> 00:53:05.849
and share.

922
00:53:05.932 --> 00:53:07.100
and bond.

923
00:53:07.184 --> 00:53:10.270
You like what you like.
The rest is just posturing.

924
00:53:13.398 --> 00:53:14.441
You may be right.

925
00:53:15.692 --> 00:53:16.902
Let's try another one.

926
00:53:23.408 --> 00:53:24.492
What do you think?

927
00:53:26.328 --> 00:53:27.162
Wow.

928
00:53:28.747 --> 00:53:29.831
Another good one.

929
00:53:32.125 --> 00:53:35.587
So what did you learn tonight.
Mr. Carter?

930
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:38.381
I've learned that maybe...

931
00:53:39.925 --> 00:53:42.552
...there's actually some good grapes
in Los Santos.

932
00:53:43.428 --> 00:53:46.473
Huckabee Estates. Every one of them.

933
00:53:51.519 --> 00:53:52.938
What's up with the sale?

934
00:53:54.356 --> 00:53:56.441
Moe said something about a collective.

935
00:53:57.108 --> 00:54:03.531
Well. no single local winemaker
can afford to buy the property.

936
00:54:03.615 --> 00:54:04.491
so

937
00:54:05.033 --> 00:54:08.870
I am getting them to all pool together.

938
00:54:10.121 --> 00:54:11.248
I see.

939
00:54:11.331 --> 00:54:14.876
And we have just enough
to meet the bank's market value.

940
00:54:15.502 --> 00:54:16.753
I hope that'll do it.

941
00:54:18.046 --> 00:54:19.339
Yeah. me too.

942
00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:25.804
So what else have you learned tonight?

943
00:54:29.933 --> 00:54:31.977
I've learned that sometimes

944
00:54:32.852 --> 00:54:34.521
you need to take chances.

945
00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:41.027
I think I learned that tonight too.

946
00:54:55.625 --> 00:54:56.668
Okey dokey.

947
00:54:56.751 --> 00:54:58.878
I think I should go now.

948
00:54:58.962 --> 00:54:59.879
Are you sure?

949
00:54:59.963 --> 00:55:01.923
No. Yes.

950
00:55:02.007 --> 00:55:04.551
I... I should go check on the boys
and crash.

951
00:55:06.219 --> 00:55:08.805
Okay. yeah. Uh. understood.

952
00:55:08.888 --> 00:55:10.348
I'll... I'll clean up here.

953
00:55:10.432 --> 00:55:11.391
Thanks.

954
00:55:11.474 --> 00:55:14.519
And thank you for the wine tasting tips.

955
00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:15.854
Yeah.

956
00:55:15.937 --> 00:55:17.022
Oh. and I. uh...

957
00:55:17.647 --> 00:55:20.358
I like your nose too.

958
00:55:41.671 --> 00:55:44.090
Bottled at Moe's Garage?

959
00:55:44.174 --> 00:55:46.676
You sneaky devil. You do have talent.

960
00:55:47.344 --> 00:55:48.970
2016.

961
00:55:49.054 --> 00:55:50.347
That's your vintage?

962
00:55:51.014 --> 00:55:52.724
Hmm.

963
00:56:01.941 --> 00:56:03.568
What do we have here?

964
00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:08.365
Huckabee and Baldwyn?

965
00:56:09.657 --> 00:56:11.034
1977?

966
00:56:14.245 --> 00:56:15.205
What the...

967
00:56:41.648 --> 00:56:44.067
Well. I haven't heard from you
in quite a while.

968
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:45.527
Have you fled to Cabo?

969
00:56:45.610 --> 00:56:46.736
No.

970
00:56:47.445 --> 00:56:48.988
I'm doing what you asked me to do.

971
00:56:49.072 --> 00:56:49.906
<i>And?</i>

972
00:56:50.824 --> 00:56:53.326
Did you know that Grandpa George
and Hollis Huckabee

973
00:56:53.410 --> 00:56:54.869
<i>used to be business partners?</i>

974
00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:57.664
That's not what I sent you to find out.

975
00:56:57.747 --> 00:57:00.375
But Grandpa George believed in
what could be created here.

976
00:57:01.376 --> 00:57:03.128
Right. Well. that's ancient history.

977
00:57:03.211 --> 00:57:05.338
Those two had absolutely
no business sense.

978
00:57:05.422 --> 00:57:06.381
They were dreamers.

979
00:57:07.799 --> 00:57:09.509
What's wrong with being a dreamer?

980
00:57:09.592 --> 00:57:12.178
Because. eventually.
you have to wake up and face reality.

981
00:57:12.262 --> 00:57:13.763
Now what did you find out?

982
00:57:14.347 --> 00:57:18.226
Well. I found a whole community of people
who really resent Baldwyn Wines.

983
00:57:21.771 --> 00:57:23.773
They're all pooling together

984
00:57:24.941 --> 00:57:26.234
to try to keep the vineyard.

985
00:57:27.485 --> 00:57:30.029
Well. that's so sad. It's almost funny.

986
00:57:30.113 --> 00:57:32.365
That's not sad. Mom. It's sweet.

987
00:57:32.449 --> 00:57:35.910
Carter. don't go soft on me.
This is gonna be great for the company.

988
00:57:35.994 --> 00:57:38.037
<i>Now did you find out what they're bidding?</i>

989
00:57:39.831 --> 00:57:41.124
I don't think that...

990
00:57:42.250 --> 00:57:43.960
I don't think that
we should be doing this.

991
00:57:44.043 --> 00:57:45.336
<i>It's not a fair fight.</i>

992
00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:47.422
Life isn't fair. Carter.

993
00:57:48.047 --> 00:57:49.716
<i>Now I've sent you there to do a job.</i>

994
00:57:49.799 --> 00:57:51.885
Did you do it. or did you not?

995
00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:02.645
They have just enough
to match the bank's appraisal.

996
00:58:03.730 --> 00:58:05.148
Well. there you go!

997
00:58:05.231 --> 00:58:06.900
That wasn't so hard. was it?

998
00:58:07.442 --> 00:58:10.820
Oh my God. The board members
will be so excited about this purchase.

999
00:58:11.321 --> 00:58:13.948
Actually. I think I'm gonna announce it
at the Christmas party.

1000
00:58:14.449 --> 00:58:15.533
Now get back here!

1001
00:58:15.617 --> 00:58:17.952
I need your help choosing
the hors d'oeuvres.

1002
00:58:18.036 --> 00:58:19.037
I can't leave yet.

1003
00:58:19.996 --> 00:58:21.623
Oh my God. Why the hell not?

1004
00:58:22.832 --> 00:58:25.960
Because I have another job.
and I won't leave until I see it through.

1005
00:58:26.544 --> 00:58:27.378
Goodbye.

1006
00:58:48.441 --> 00:58:49.609
Morning. sunshine.

1007
00:58:50.235 --> 00:58:51.653
Oh. perfect. Val just left.

1008
00:58:52.904 --> 00:58:54.322
Is she not aware of our...

1009
00:58:54.405 --> 00:58:55.990
I'm taking a chance.

1010
00:58:57.742 --> 00:59:01.079
It's better to beg for forgiveness
than ask permission.

1011
00:59:03.748 --> 00:59:05.083
I read it on a bumper sticker.

1012
00:59:05.166 --> 00:59:07.377
Ah. Let's get to it.

1013
00:59:12.674 --> 00:59:13.591
<i>âª All right! âª</i>

1014
00:59:14.634 --> 00:59:17.303
<i>âª I don't have a whole lot of money âª</i>

1015

1018
00:59:29.232 --> 00:59:31.693
<i>âª No hidden agenda âª</i>

1019
00:59:32.318 --> 00:59:34.946
<i>âª What you see. what you get âª</i>

1020
00:59:35.947 --> 00:59:38.950
<i>âª I might tell the odd tall tale âª</i>

<i>âª But nothin' I would regret âª</i>

1022

1023

1028
01:00:07.312 --> 01:00:09.814
Santi. you're gonna get it.
You just need more practice.

1029
01:00:09.897 --> 01:00:10.815
Watch me.

1030
01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:14.569
Fer. look.

1031
01:00:24.537 --> 01:00:25.955
Santi.

1032
01:00:26.956 --> 01:00:28.082
Fernando!

1033
01:00:28.666 --> 01:00:29.626
Oh. Carter.

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:34.380
<i>âª You never know âª</i>

1035
01:00:35.506 --> 01:00:37.592
<i>âª Who's watching you âª</i>

1036
01:00:38.551 --> 01:00:39.636
Cindy.

1037
01:00:39.719 --> 01:00:41.846
- Uh...
- Just hear me out. okay?

1038
01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:43.389
What is that?

1039
01:00:44.015 --> 01:00:46.100
<i>âª A hard workin' man âª</i>

1040
01:00:46.184 --> 01:00:49.562
<i>- âª Hard workin' man âª
- âª Hard workin' man âª</i>

1041

<i>âª Hard workin'... âª</i>

1042
01:00:56.944 --> 01:00:58.696
No. that's great. Larry.

1043
01:00:59.364 --> 01:01:02.700
- Hold on. I'm getting out of the car.
- <i>Okay.</i>

1044
01:01:05.161 --> 01:01:08.373
So how much are they investing?

1045
01:01:08.456 --> 01:01:11.125
<i>They were able to come up
with another 50.000.</i>

1046
01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:12.960
So what's our total now?

1047
01:01:13.044 --> 01:01:15.421
- <i>It's just over asking price.</i>
- Please don't die.

1048
01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:16.839
<i>There's no other party.</i>

1049
01:01:16.923 --> 01:01:18.299
<i>It's looking good. Val.</i>

1050
01:01:19.467 --> 01:01:21.177
Larry. I'll call you right back.

1051
01:01:21.761 --> 01:01:22.887
Hey. Val.

1052
01:01:25.181 --> 01:01:26.099
What is that?

1053
01:01:26.182 --> 01:01:27.225
It's awesome.

1054
01:01:27.308 --> 01:01:29.394
They built us a snowboard ramp
to practice on.

1055
01:01:29.477 --> 01:01:31.562
It's both crazy and awesome.

1056
01:01:31.646 --> 01:01:32.647
What do you think?

1057
01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:35.024
I was just about to test it out.

1058
01:01:35.108 --> 01:01:36.859
Look. you won't be able to dig an edge in.

1059
01:01:36.943 --> 01:01:39.278
but it should be good practice
until we hit the powder.

1060
01:01:40.822 --> 01:01:42.699
Cowabunga. dudes!

1061
01:01:45.827 --> 01:01:46.869
Ooh!

1062
01:01:46.953 --> 01:01:48.246
Ooh. good God.

1063
01:01:48.329 --> 01:01:50.248
Well. at least the ramp held.

1064
01:01:51.749 --> 01:01:53.626
Please tell me
someone got a video of that.

1065
01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:54.961
Are you okay?

1066
01:01:55.044 --> 01:01:56.462
Oh. yeah. I'm fine.

1067
01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:57.505
Who's next?

1068
01:01:57.588 --> 01:01:59.006
Oh. no. no. no. no. no.

1069
01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:01.134
- Not my boys. No hospital visits today.
- Please?

1070
01:02:01.217 --> 01:02:03.469
- Come on. Mom.
- Nope. nope. nope. nope. nope.

1071
01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:06.055
- Mm-mm.
- You know. I think I may have a solution.

1072
01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:20.611
Yes!

1073
01:02:29.162 --> 01:02:30.830
Whoa!

1074
01:02:30.913 --> 01:02:31.789
Ooh!

1075
01:02:31.873 --> 01:02:33.708
Baby. are you all right?

1076
01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:35.626
I'm okay!

1077
01:02:36.919 --> 01:02:38.838
Don't forget your goggles!

1078
01:02:39.881 --> 01:02:41.632
You got this. Santi!

1079
01:02:42.383 --> 01:02:43.760
- Mm-hmm.
- Come on!

1080
01:02:49.015 --> 01:02:50.975
- Santi!
- You did it!

1081
01:02:53.102 --> 01:02:55.313
- Woo-hoo!
- Ooh. smooth!

1082
01:02:56.063 --> 01:02:57.273
- Watch this.
- Careful!

1083
01:02:57.356 --> 01:02:59.025
Whoa!

1084
01:02:59.108 --> 01:03:00.026
Ooh!

1085
01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:01.778
Maybe take a break.

1086
01:03:05.698 --> 01:03:06.908
Woo!

1087
01:03:07.575 --> 01:03:08.659
Whoa!

1088
01:03:08.743 --> 01:03:10.244
- Good job.
- Okay!

1089
01:03:12.955 --> 01:03:14.290
He looks so confident.

1090
01:03:14.373 --> 01:03:16.083
I know! He's loving it.

1091
01:03:19.086 --> 01:03:19.962
So...

1092
01:03:20.963 --> 01:03:22.590
are you still leaving tomorrow?

1093
01:03:24.967 --> 01:03:27.470
Well. I'm just about done here. so...

1094
01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:29.639
yeah.

1095
01:03:30.598 --> 01:03:32.058
Look at them.

1096
01:03:32.141 --> 01:03:34.519
- Those two youngsters make it so hard.
- Mmm.

1097
01:03:34.602 --> 01:03:37.355
I've learned when you know what you want.
you just gotta go after it.

1098
01:03:38.147 --> 01:03:40.107
Yeah. me too.

1099
01:03:40.191 --> 01:03:41.067
Hmm.

1100
01:03:41.859 --> 01:03:42.985
Give me your phone.

1101
01:03:44.987 --> 01:03:46.906
Okay. here I go.

1102
01:03:49.742 --> 01:03:51.369
Good job. baby.

1103
01:03:53.371 --> 01:03:54.705
It's my phone number.

1104
01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:55.998
Dare you to call it.

1105
01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:01.629
<i>- âª Sexy. sexy lady... âª</i>

1106
01:04:01.712 --> 01:04:02.964
Think your phone's ringing.

1107
01:04:06.259 --> 01:04:08.636
Moe and Cindy seem to be hitting it off.

1108
01:04:09.387 --> 01:04:10.721
They're going to get drinks.

1109
01:04:11.222 --> 01:04:12.056
Huh.

1110
01:04:12.890 --> 01:04:13.766
You?

1111
01:04:14.642 --> 01:04:17.144
- Uh. you wouldn't want to get--
- Mom. we're ready!

1112
01:04:17.687 --> 01:04:19.897
Fernando's gonna finish all the popcorn.

1113
01:04:19.981 --> 01:04:21.357
I'll be right there.

1114
01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:24.527
Movie night.

1115
01:04:25.111 --> 01:04:26.028
Right.

1116
01:04:26.112 --> 01:04:28.072
They worked hard today.
They. uh... They deserve it.

1117
01:04:28.155 --> 01:04:29.323
Carter.

1118
01:04:29.407 --> 01:04:31.325
You want to watch <i>Home Alone</i> with us?

1119
01:04:33.494 --> 01:04:36.038
Uh. I guess. yeah.

1120
01:04:36.122 --> 01:04:36.956
No!

1121
01:04:37.039 --> 01:04:39.500
Why would you ask him that?
This is our thing.

1122
01:04:43.337 --> 01:04:44.672
You know. I should probably go.

1123
01:04:44.755 --> 01:04:46.549
- Sorry.
- No. it's all good.

1124
01:04:58.352 --> 01:04:59.186
Hey.

1125
01:05:05.902 --> 01:05:07.612
Does that mean you don't want to talk?

1126
01:05:12.450 --> 01:05:14.285
But I thought you liked Carter.

1127
01:05:15.161 --> 01:05:17.079
You guys had a fun day today.

1128
01:05:17.872 --> 01:05:19.457
I do like him. but...

1129
01:05:21.375 --> 01:05:22.919
he's not our dad.

1130
01:05:23.002 --> 01:05:23.836
Oh.

1131
01:05:24.462 --> 01:05:26.589
Baby. of course he's not.

1132
01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:30.426
No one will ever replace your dad.

1133
01:05:30.509 --> 01:05:32.345
No one ever could.

1134
01:05:33.304 --> 01:05:35.681
He's just a friend of ours. That's all.

1135
01:05:35.765 --> 01:05:38.267
Movie night is only for family.

1136
01:05:38.351 --> 01:05:39.268
Okay.

1137
01:05:39.352 --> 01:05:41.354
Then it's just gonna be the three of us.

1138
01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:44.815
I don't want to share you.

1139
01:05:45.399 --> 01:05:46.233
Oh.

1140
01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:53.574
Come here.

1141
01:06:01.499 --> 01:06:02.458
Listen to me.

1142
01:06:03.751 --> 01:06:06.087
I miss your dad every day.

1143
01:06:08.839 --> 01:06:12.426
But I'm so lucky I get to see his face

1144
01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:17.139
every time I look
at these two handsome faces.

1145
01:06:25.523 --> 01:06:28.025
There's something I want you boys to know.

1146
01:06:30.528 --> 01:06:32.238
When Fernando was born.

1147
01:06:35.366 --> 01:06:39.996
your dad and I didn't think
there was any way we could love

1148
01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:43.499
anything as much as we loved him.

1149
01:06:44.583 --> 01:06:46.585
Our hearts were so full.

1150
01:06:47.128 --> 01:06:49.338
And then I got pregnant with Santi.

1151
01:06:51.966 --> 01:06:53.092
And we were like.

1152
01:06:53.718 --> 01:06:54.719
"What are we gonna do?"

1153
01:06:54.802 --> 01:06:58.723
"Do we have to split our love
into two parts?"

1154
01:06:59.974 --> 01:07:01.225
And you were born

1155
01:07:02.143 --> 01:07:03.144
and it was...

1156
01:07:05.021 --> 01:07:05.896
magic.

1157
01:07:07.023 --> 01:07:09.859
No. we didn't have to split
our love into two parts.

1158
01:07:11.610 --> 01:07:13.112
Our hearts doubled.

1159
01:07:16.449 --> 01:07:20.411
And that is what you two boys
taught me and your dad.

1160
01:07:21.954 --> 01:07:22.913
What?

1161
01:07:31.172 --> 01:07:33.174
That there's no limit to love.

1162
01:07:35.676 --> 01:07:37.011
If you let it grow.

1163
01:07:38.554 --> 01:07:39.972
your heart gets bigger.

1164
01:07:44.268 --> 01:07:47.438
So don't think that because us.

1165
01:07:47.521 --> 01:07:48.773
the three of us.

1166
01:07:49.398 --> 01:07:50.566
love each other.

1167
01:07:51.192 --> 01:07:53.694
that by letting someone new into our life.

1168
01:07:54.945 --> 01:07:55.905
we're gonna

1169
01:07:56.781 --> 01:07:59.450
love each other. or your dad. any less.

1170
01:08:00.701 --> 01:08:02.119
That's not how it works.

1171
01:08:02.787 --> 01:08:03.913
<i>Entendido?</i>

1172
01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:06.248
- Yeah.
<i>- Entendido?</i>

1173
01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:08.000
Yeah.

1174
01:08:08.084 --> 01:08:12.046
I love you two until the cows come home.

1175
01:08:12.838 --> 01:08:17.468
And until the chickens
fly north for the winter.

1176
01:08:33.692 --> 01:08:34.819
Wow.

1177
01:08:34.902 --> 01:08:39.615
You spent all these years
making this incredible wine.

1178
01:08:39.698 --> 01:08:41.659
- and this is your label?
- Okay.

1179
01:08:44.036 --> 01:08:45.955
Boy. you are lucky I came along.

1180
01:08:46.038 --> 01:08:47.248
Mmm. cheers to that.

1181
01:08:59.218 --> 01:09:01.262
You actually finished
something you started.

1182
01:09:11.605 --> 01:09:12.481
Val?

1183
01:09:15.025 --> 01:09:15.901
Val?

1184
01:09:18.696 --> 01:09:19.864
Santi?

1185
01:09:19.947 --> 01:09:20.865
Fernando?

1186
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:23.951
Anybody home?

1187
01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:08.287
Val. I hope you like my wall.

1188
01:10:09.455 --> 01:10:10.289
Carter.

1189
01:10:18.255 --> 01:10:19.340
<i>Hey. Moe.</i>

1190
01:10:19.423 --> 01:10:21.884
Hey. I'll see you
at the wine festival today. right?

1191
01:10:23.594 --> 01:10:25.804
No. no. I have. um...

1192
01:10:25.888 --> 01:10:27.348
Uh. I got something I have to do.

1193
01:10:27.431 --> 01:10:29.225
No. no. no. you're coming.

1194
01:10:29.308 --> 01:10:30.142
L... Listen.

1195
01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:33.646
I'm putting out my Pour Decisions 2016.
Now you said you love that one. right?

1196
01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:35.856
Yeah. yeah. I do.

1197
01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:38.651
It's very important
that you come experience

1198
01:10:38.734 --> 01:10:40.819
<i>what the other winemakers
in this valley are creating.</i>

1199
01:10:40.903 --> 01:10:44.615
So be at my booth 2:00 p.m.
It's right by the entrance.

1200
01:10:44.698 --> 01:10:45.783
And don't be late.

1201
01:10:57.503 --> 01:10:59.505
Hi. I'll take two. please.

1202
01:11:02.633 --> 01:11:05.678
This is beautiful.

1203
01:11:11.141 --> 01:11:13.602
This is my bestseller. You want to try it?

1204
01:11:16.814 --> 01:11:18.983
Then you take a sip. and you'll see.

1205
01:11:26.865 --> 01:11:27.783
Thank you.

1206
01:11:33.706 --> 01:11:34.581
Wow.

1207
01:11:35.165 --> 01:11:36.875
This is a very interesting sauvignon.

1208
01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:42.047
She uses a steel drum to ferment.
but she adds her own special twist.

1209
01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:43.716
Well. she nailed it.

1210
01:11:43.799 --> 01:11:45.968
Thank you.

1211
01:11:46.051 --> 01:11:47.386
I learned it from my grandma.

1212
01:11:47.469 --> 01:11:49.972
Maybe I will teach Brynne someday.

1213
01:11:50.055 --> 01:11:51.890
Thank you so much. I appreciate it.

1214
01:11:54.685 --> 01:11:57.062
Hey. young buck. Right on time.

1215
01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:58.272
On time for what?

1216
01:11:58.355 --> 01:12:01.066
To. uh... Just for the time
that we said we'd meet.

1217
01:12:04.695 --> 01:12:05.529
Hey. guys.

1218
01:12:06.989 --> 01:12:07.865
Valentina.

1219
01:12:07.948 --> 01:12:09.241
- Hi.
- Hi.

1220
01:12:09.908 --> 01:12:12.077
Are you checking out the festival?

1221
01:12:12.161 --> 01:12:12.995
Yeah.

1222
01:12:13.078 --> 01:12:14.705
Well. actually. I'm here to meet Moe.

1223
01:12:14.788 --> 01:12:15.998
Oh. cool.

1224
01:12:16.081 --> 01:12:17.583
Uh. I'm meeting Cindy.

1225
01:12:19.293 --> 01:12:20.210
What time?

1226
01:12:20.878 --> 01:12:21.712
2:00.

1227
01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:24.131
You're right on time.

1228
01:12:24.214 --> 01:12:25.090
For what?

1229
01:12:26.425 --> 01:12:27.551
A setup.

1230
01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:30.429
Huh.

1231
01:12:30.512 --> 01:12:31.889
Would you look at that?

1232
01:12:34.058 --> 01:12:36.185
Oh. we might have some answers here.

1233
01:12:40.689 --> 01:12:42.691
<i>This is a fun-napping.</i>

1234
01:12:42.775 --> 01:12:45.194
<i>Do not attempt to contact authorities.</i>

1235
01:12:45.277 --> 01:12:47.071
<i>Do not attempt to trace this call.</i>

1236
01:12:47.154 --> 01:12:48.906
<i>Or video... Whatever.</i>

1237
01:12:48.989 --> 01:12:50.699
<i>My demands are simple.</i>

1238
01:12:50.783 --> 01:12:52.117
<i>Have fun today.</i>

1239
01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:55.746
<i>and do not worry about these rugrats
for one second.</i>

1240
01:12:55.829 --> 01:12:57.915
<i>I will send proof of life every hour.</i>

1241
01:12:57.998 --> 01:12:59.583
<i>But if my demands are not met...</i>

1242
01:13:04.004 --> 01:13:06.715
<i>...I will feed these children so much sugar</i>

1243
01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:08.550
<i>their heads will pop off.</i>

1244
01:13:08.634 --> 01:13:09.551
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1245
01:13:10.177 --> 01:13:11.804
<i>Your hands should be tied
behind your back.</i>

1246
01:13:11.887 --> 01:13:12.846
<i>I already did that part.</i>

1247
01:13:12.930 --> 01:13:15.140
<i>- It's still recording.
- Going off script here. guys. Okay.</i>

1248
01:13:16.266 --> 01:13:17.351
Oh no.

1249
01:13:17.935 --> 01:13:19.812
You know.
I've seen this kind of thing before.

1250
01:13:19.895 --> 01:13:20.729
It's. uh...

1251
01:13:21.313 --> 01:13:23.357
This one looks like
a professional fun-napper.

1252
01:13:24.566 --> 01:13:26.610
You know.
I don't think we have a choice but to. uh.

1253
01:13:26.693 --> 01:13:28.278
have a lot of fun.

1254
01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:31.323
Okay.

1255
01:13:32.658 --> 01:13:35.327
Uh. let me send a message first.

1256
01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:44.294
I am a mother
with a very particular set of skills.

1257
01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:47.965
If too much sugar enters
those boys' bodies.

1258
01:13:48.048 --> 01:13:49.466
I will find you.

1259
01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:52.010
and I will make you pay.

1260
01:13:53.345 --> 01:13:54.179
For brunch.

1261
01:13:58.267 --> 01:14:00.853
Come on. I've got a wine you need to try.

1262
01:14:04.982 --> 01:14:06.066
Works every time.

1263
01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:08.485
- Carter. this is Joe.
- It's nice to meet you.

1264
01:14:09.403 --> 01:14:13.073
Joe was always one of Chris's
favorite <i>garagistes.</i>

1265
01:14:13.157 --> 01:14:15.784
- Well. then I'm already impressed.
- Thank you.

1266
01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:17.911
I use a very simplistic approach.

1267
01:14:17.995 --> 01:14:22.166
I don't filter. fine.
or cold and stabilize my wines at all.

1268
01:14:22.249 --> 01:14:25.711
- Wow. Well. I'd love to try some.
- Oh. we're gonna try a whole bottle.

1269
01:14:25.794 --> 01:14:27.629
Oh. thanks.

1270
01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:30.549
And a cheese plate. please.

1271
01:14:31.425 --> 01:14:32.259
Enjoy.

1272
01:14:32.843 --> 01:14:33.677
Thank you.

1273
01:14:43.645 --> 01:14:46.857
<i>âª Walking through all of this madness âª</i>

1274
01:14:48.025 --> 01:14:51.195
<i>âª I fell in love with life regardless... âª</i>

1275
01:14:51.278 --> 01:14:54.198
I see all these people
enjoying what they do

1276
01:14:54.281 --> 01:14:56.408
and talking about it with so much passion.

1277
01:14:58.660 --> 01:14:59.661
That's not me.

1278
01:15:01.663 --> 01:15:03.290
What are you passionate about?

1279
01:15:04.082 --> 01:15:04.917
Honestly?

1280
01:15:05.959 --> 01:15:06.835
I don't know.

1281
01:15:08.212 --> 01:15:10.964
My mom kind of planned
my whole life for me.

1282
01:15:12.257 --> 01:15:13.842
Even down to who I should marry.

1283
01:15:15.969 --> 01:15:16.803
Oh.

1284
01:15:17.596 --> 01:15:18.639
How's that going?

1285
01:15:21.183 --> 01:15:23.268
I owe the poor girl an apology.

1286
01:15:27.314 --> 01:15:28.857
How about your father?

1287
01:15:31.485 --> 01:15:33.695
He passed away when I was young.

1288
01:15:35.656 --> 01:15:36.865
I'm sorry.

1289
01:15:39.076 --> 01:15:42.329
Yeah. my mom.
she kind of got overbearing after that.

1290
01:15:43.872 --> 01:15:47.543
She probably just thought
she was protecting me. but. uh...

1291
01:15:47.626 --> 01:15:51.505
I just refused to be who she wanted.

1292
01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:54.216
So I rebelled.

1293
01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:59.346
Into the wild world of carpentry?

1294
01:16:01.473 --> 01:16:03.016
Yeah. something like that.

1295
01:16:04.685 --> 01:16:07.187
She says that I'm a. uh. poet

1296
01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:09.481
who can't rhyme.

1297
01:16:12.693 --> 01:16:15.028
And I say she's a nut that won't crack.

1298
01:16:15.571 --> 01:16:17.781
- She's unbreakable.
- Oh.

1299
01:16:18.657 --> 01:16:20.117
I bet she's not that bad.

1300
01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:22.828
Oh. if only you knew who my mother was.

1301
01:16:22.911 --> 01:16:24.538
You might think the same thing.

1302
01:16:25.205 --> 01:16:28.584
I'm sure most children
say that about their mothers.

1303
01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:33.338
I can only imagine what my kids
will say about me one day.

1304
01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:35.716
You're a great mom.

1305
01:16:35.799 --> 01:16:37.509
How would you know that?

1306
01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:39.595
You've only known me for a few days.

1307
01:16:39.678 --> 01:16:41.471
Yeah. but I know your kids.

1308
01:16:41.555 --> 01:16:43.807
And your kids are awesome.

1309
01:16:43.890 --> 01:16:46.893
They have a sense
of who they are in this world.

1310
01:16:46.977 --> 01:16:48.604
And they're not born with that.

1311
01:16:50.063 --> 01:16:51.648
You instilled that in them.

1312
01:16:57.863 --> 01:16:58.697
Yeah.

1313
01:17:00.699 --> 01:17:01.783
They're pretty great.

1314
01:17:04.536 --> 01:17:05.704
So are you.

1315
01:17:24.097 --> 01:17:26.642
Okay. I think we need more wine.

1316
01:17:27.768 --> 01:17:29.811
Uh. you know what?

1317
01:17:29.895 --> 01:17:31.938
I. uh... I think I know a guy.

1318
01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:34.191
I'll be right back.

1319
01:17:44.034 --> 01:17:45.994
I don't know why
you're not picking up.

1320
01:17:46.078 --> 01:17:47.996
You're the one
who loves phone technology so much.

1321
01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:50.290
<i>This is Margo. Leave a message.</i>

1322
01:17:50.374 --> 01:17:53.168
Hey. just listen to me. okay? You can't...

1323
01:17:54.336 --> 01:17:55.671
And lastly.

1324
01:17:55.754 --> 01:17:57.839
I don't want anyone to get too excited.

1325
01:17:57.923 --> 01:17:59.966
but I may have something in the works

1326
01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:02.386
that's going to allow us
to expand next year.

1327
01:18:03.011 --> 01:18:06.056
Is that why we haven't seen Carter?

1328
01:18:08.767 --> 01:18:09.851
I'll tell you more tomorrow.

1329
01:18:09.935 --> 01:18:11.144
Thanks for coming.

1330
01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:12.854

Oh. this can't be happening.

1415
01:22:22.896 --> 01:22:27.525
Oh. the planning. the contracts.
and the meetings.

1416
01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:30.654
How am I gonna tell everybody
that we lost the vineyard?

1417
01:22:33.239 --> 01:22:34.616
And to Baldwyn Wines.

1418
01:22:34.699 --> 01:22:37.869
Oh. I should've known
they would do something like this.

1419
01:22:39.913 --> 01:22:41.122
I am so sorry.

1420
01:22:47.545 --> 01:22:51.758
How could they possibly know
the exact amount to bid?

1421
01:22:51.841 --> 01:22:52.717
I don't know.

1422
01:22:58.139 --> 01:22:59.474
It was me.

1423
01:23:01.893 --> 01:23:02.727
What?

1424
01:23:05.397 --> 01:23:07.232
It was me.

1425
01:23:08.358 --> 01:23:09.526
What was you?

1426
01:23:13.863 --> 01:23:17.701
I was the one who told Baldwyn Wines
how much your collective was bidding.

1427
01:23:17.784 --> 01:23:19.411
I'm so sorry. Val.

1428
01:23:19.494 --> 01:23:22.622
It was before I knew
how special your community was.

1429
01:23:24.541 --> 01:23:26.543
Why? Why would you do that?

1430
01:23:32.549 --> 01:23:33.466
Because...

1431
01:23:39.389 --> 01:23:40.640
I'm Carter Baldwyn.

1432
01:23:41.433 --> 01:23:44.144
It's my fam... My mother's business.

1433
01:23:44.227 --> 01:23:46.896
And I called her earlier.
and I pleaded with her

1434
01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:48.231
not to submit her bid.

1435
01:23:49.357 --> 01:23:50.358
A lot of good that did.

1436
01:23:50.442 --> 01:23:52.027
Well. I thought she would listen to me.

1437
01:23:52.110 --> 01:23:55.363
If I could go back and change everything.
I would do it in a second.

1438
01:23:57.991 --> 01:23:59.492
So everything was a lie?

1439
01:24:01.453 --> 01:24:02.495
No.

1440
01:24:02.579 --> 01:24:03.455
No.

1441
01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:05.623
Not how I feel about you.

1442
01:24:09.002 --> 01:24:10.879
Words are from the lips. Carter.

1443
01:24:11.463 --> 01:24:13.131
Actions are from the heart.

1444
01:24:16.634 --> 01:24:17.969
- Val--
- Goodbye.

1445
01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:30.273
Kind of wish the drywall had killed you.

1446
01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:34.944
Yeah. me too.

1447
01:24:38.281 --> 01:24:40.033
Okay. hey. you know what?

1448
01:24:40.116 --> 01:24:43.203
You came clean.
That's the important thing.

1449
01:24:43.286 --> 01:24:45.580
The only way forward is the truth.

1450
01:24:47.499 --> 01:24:48.917
It was the wine talking.

1451
01:24:49.417 --> 01:24:50.960
<i>In vino veritas.</i>

1452
01:24:51.878 --> 01:24:53.379
Oh. is that what that means?

1453
01:24:55.965 --> 01:24:57.300
There's someone I need to talk to.

1454
01:24:58.760 --> 01:24:59.677
Vino...

1455
01:25:07.268 --> 01:25:08.353
Yes. son?

1456
01:25:08.436 --> 01:25:09.938
You need to retract the bid.

1457
01:25:11.356 --> 01:25:12.649
Enough. Carter.

1458
01:25:13.149 --> 01:25:15.819
The Baldwyn Wine's name
will be on that vineyard.

1459
01:25:15.902 --> 01:25:17.779
<i>You brought honor
to the family name. honey.</i>

1460
01:25:17.862 --> 01:25:19.197
Family name?

1461
01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:21.866
That's a joke.
Grandpa George would be sick

1462
01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:24.452
to find out what's happening
to the people of Los Santos.

1463
01:25:24.536 --> 01:25:27.664
Grandpa George and Hollis Huckabee
wanted to make money too.

1464
01:25:27.747 --> 01:25:29.415
They just weren't any good at it.

1465
01:25:29.916 --> 01:25:31.835
A trait they passed on to your father.

1466
01:25:31.918 --> 01:25:33.128
<i>God rest his soul.</i>

1467
01:25:33.837 --> 01:25:35.046
When he died.

1468
01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:38.258
he left me all alone
with a failing company and a young child.

1469
01:25:38.967 --> 01:25:42.387
I had to step up.
I made the family name what it is today.

1470
01:25:44.139 --> 01:25:46.891
Well. what good does that do
the <i>garagistes</i> in Los Santos?

1471
01:25:48.101 --> 01:25:48.935
Well.

1472
01:25:49.435 --> 01:25:53.273
they can get drunk on very cheap wine
and forget all their problems.

1473
01:25:56.776 --> 01:25:59.154
You disappoint me. Mother.

1474
01:26:03.408 --> 01:26:04.367
And you me.

1475
01:26:08.163 --> 01:26:10.957
This company may have been founded
by a dreamer. but it was nothing

1476
01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:13.418
until someone woke up and faced reality.

1477
01:26:14.294 --> 01:26:15.253
I did that.

1478
01:26:17.130 --> 01:26:18.798
And I suggest you do the same.

1479
01:26:18.882 --> 01:26:20.800
<i>Don't bother coming tomorrow.</i>

1480
01:26:37.817 --> 01:26:40.445
He moved in. lived here.

1481
01:26:40.528 --> 01:26:42.280
Right under my nose.

1482
01:26:42.363 --> 01:26:45.033
And the whole time.
he was just gathering information.

1483
01:26:45.575 --> 01:26:46.576
Who does that?

1484
01:26:46.659 --> 01:26:47.577
A spy.

1485
01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:50.330
Like. a sexy... sexy wine spy.

1486
01:26:50.413 --> 01:26:51.456
- You know who I blame?
- Huh?

1487
01:26:51.539 --> 01:26:54.459
Reality TV shows
and those home remodeling shows

1488
01:26:54.542 --> 01:26:58.463
because they make you believe that
the world is filled with sexy carpenters.

1489
01:26:58.546 --> 01:27:01.549
What does this say
about my judge of character

1490
01:27:01.633 --> 01:27:04.260
that I allowed him around my boys?

1491
01:27:04.344 --> 01:27:05.428
Babe.

1492
01:27:05.511 --> 01:27:07.722
They are going to be fine. okay?

1493
01:27:07.805 --> 01:27:10.350
They knew him for. like. five days.

1494
01:27:10.934 --> 01:27:12.602
I need you to be fine.

1495
01:27:12.685 --> 01:27:14.479
- I'm fine.
- Oh. okay.

1496
01:27:15.355 --> 01:27:16.689
I just feel alone.

1497
01:27:17.482 --> 01:27:18.316
Hey.

1498
01:27:18.858 --> 01:27:20.068
you're not alone.

1499
01:27:20.693 --> 01:27:25.031
Okay? You are still surrounded
by plenty of people who love you.

1500
01:27:27.825 --> 01:27:28.993
All right. look.

1501
01:27:29.077 --> 01:27:30.703
So you took a chance. okay?

1502
01:27:30.787 --> 01:27:32.956
You put yourself out there.
and it didn't work out.

1503
01:27:33.539 --> 01:27:34.374
It sucks.

1504
01:27:35.625 --> 01:27:37.460
But I'm still really proud of you. Val.

1505
01:27:41.631 --> 01:27:43.341
- Was the kiss good?
- Really good.

1506
01:27:43.424 --> 01:27:44.342
Yeah.

1507
01:27:44.425 --> 01:27:45.468
Yeah. that tracts.

1508
01:27:58.106 --> 01:27:59.899
Time to face the music. young buck.

1509
01:28:11.494 --> 01:28:15.248
Thank you for letting me stay here.
I. uh... I didn't know what else to do.

1510
01:28:16.374 --> 01:28:18.251
Think it's time I gave you your gift.

1511
01:28:19.085 --> 01:28:21.462
Uh. honestly. that's not necessary.

1512
01:28:22.297 --> 01:28:25.633
I think I'm more in
the coal territory this year.

1513
01:28:26.384 --> 01:28:27.552
It's not what you think.

1514
01:28:27.635 --> 01:28:29.220
It's the gift of consequence.

1515
01:28:29.721 --> 01:28:31.723
So head or gut?

1516
01:28:34.058 --> 01:28:35.143
You lost me.

1517
01:28:36.686 --> 01:28:38.187
Carter. you lied to Val.

1518
01:28:38.271 --> 01:28:40.690
And you destroyed
the <i>garagiste's</i> culture in Los Santos.

1519
01:28:40.773 --> 01:28:43.818
Now. for that. you deserve one shot.
So I'm gonna let you choose.

1520
01:28:43.901 --> 01:28:45.445
Your head or your gut?

1521
01:28:48.156 --> 01:28:49.657
- You're serious?
- As a heart attack.

1522
01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:52.452
See. normally. I'd let it go.

1523
01:28:52.535 --> 01:28:53.786
but we're friends now.

1524
01:28:55.330 --> 01:28:56.789
So you won't forget.

1525
01:28:56.873 --> 01:28:59.709
Now. stop being such a privileged prince.

1526
01:29:07.550 --> 01:29:08.676
All right. I guess my gut.

1527
01:29:10.887 --> 01:29:12.388
Rookie mistake.

1528
01:29:12.472 --> 01:29:13.514
Gut is worse.

1529
01:29:14.932 --> 01:29:16.642
Just breathe.

1530
01:29:16.726 --> 01:29:18.895
That's right. Breathe.

1531
01:29:20.355 --> 01:29:21.898
You're a good friend. Moe.

1532
01:29:26.736 --> 01:29:27.653
You know.

1533
01:29:27.737 --> 01:29:30.323
the pain is actually
giving me some clarity.

1534
01:29:32.492 --> 01:29:35.161
No. I have to... I have to...

1535
01:29:35.244 --> 01:29:37.121
I have to see this through. I...

1536
01:29:37.205 --> 01:29:38.498
I mean. this can't be over.

1537
01:29:38.581 --> 01:29:40.833
Think I like this new attitude already.

1538
01:29:40.917 --> 01:29:42.835
If my mom is not gonna listen to me. then...

1539
01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:45.880
I need to show her right in her face
so she can't deny it.

1540
01:29:45.963 --> 01:29:48.341
- How are you gonna do that?
- I'm gonna hit her where it hurts.

1541
01:29:48.424 --> 01:29:51.219
- The gut?
- No. her pride.

1542
01:29:51.719 --> 01:29:52.553
Oh.

1543
01:29:54.347 --> 01:29:56.099
- Thinking of a plan?
- Mm-hmm.

1544
01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:00.520
Should we go grab some breakfast?

1545
01:30:00.603 --> 01:30:01.437
I got it.

1546
01:30:01.521 --> 01:30:02.438
Good.

1547
01:30:02.522 --> 01:30:03.356
Good luck.

1548
01:30:03.439 --> 01:30:06.943
No. it's not a "me" thing.
It's a "we" thing. I need your help.

1549
01:30:07.026 --> 01:30:08.111
And Cindy's.

1550
01:30:09.404 --> 01:30:10.696
I'm gonna regret this. aren't I?

1551
01:30:11.406 --> 01:30:12.615
No.

1552
01:30:12.698 --> 01:30:13.699
Well. yeah. probably.

1553
01:30:13.783 --> 01:30:15.535
There's like a 90% chance
this goes sideways.

1554
01:30:15.618 --> 01:30:17.161
but here's the plan.

1555
01:30:17.703 --> 01:30:19.330
- First. what we're gonna do...
- Mm-hmm.

1556
01:30:29.966 --> 01:30:32.635
- Ho. ho. ho.
- You're a little early...

1557
01:30:34.345 --> 01:30:35.930
Jonathan.

1558
01:30:37.014 --> 01:30:38.933
That's my secret identity.

1559
01:30:39.934 --> 01:30:41.144
Right.

1560
01:30:43.438 --> 01:30:44.480
You're good to go.

1561
01:30:44.564 --> 01:30:45.440
Thank you.

1562
01:31:03.541 --> 01:31:04.417
Finally.

1563
01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:06.878
I think we are officially married
in some states.

1564
01:31:06.961 --> 01:31:09.088
I don't wanna talk about it.

1565
01:31:11.299 --> 01:31:13.384
Grab what you can.
and we'll come back and get dressed.

1566
01:31:13.468 --> 01:31:16.262
Follow me. We have about an hour
before the gifts arrive.

1567
01:31:41.078 --> 01:31:42.330
You okay under all that. Carter?

1568
01:31:43.539 --> 01:31:44.499
Oh yeah.

1569
01:31:44.582 --> 01:31:46.209
I'm feeling the Christmas magic.

1570
01:31:47.293 --> 01:31:49.420
All right. so far. so good.

1571
01:31:50.671 --> 01:31:52.173
Which table's your mom's?

1572
01:31:53.299 --> 01:31:55.343
The one with all
the finely aged rich people.

1573
01:31:55.426 --> 01:31:57.011
Those are the board members.

1574
01:31:57.094 --> 01:31:58.721
- Cheers! Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas!

1575
01:31:58.804 --> 01:32:00.181
- Thanks. Margo.
- So nice.

1576
01:32:00.264 --> 01:32:01.349
All right. I'm on it.

1577
01:32:07.104 --> 01:32:08.481
Moe. you ready?

1578
01:32:08.564 --> 01:32:09.815
- Yeah.
- All right.

1579
01:32:09.899 --> 01:32:11.442
Just get in here. Come on.

1580
01:32:13.903 --> 01:32:16.614
This is lovely. isn't it?

1581
01:32:18.157 --> 01:32:20.826
I know. It's one of my very favorites.

1582
01:32:20.910 --> 01:32:22.286
Yeah. you have great taste.

1583
01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:24.997
- Very nice.
- Ho. ho. ho!

1584
01:32:25.081 --> 01:32:25.915
I agree.

1585
01:32:25.998 --> 01:32:28.376
Uh. c... canapÃ©s?

1586
01:32:28.459 --> 01:32:30.503
- Yes. please.
- Yes. please.

1587
01:32:30.586 --> 01:32:32.463
- Nothing for me. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1588
01:32:33.798 --> 01:32:36.092
Um. and how's everyone enjoying the wine?

1589
01:32:36.717 --> 01:32:38.844
Oh. it's absolutely fabulous.

1590
01:32:38.928 --> 01:32:40.471
Really. Margo. how do you do it?

1591
01:32:40.555 --> 01:32:44.267
Well. I have my sommelier
find the best new French wine

1592
01:32:44.350 --> 01:32:45.685
every single year.

1593
01:32:46.978 --> 01:32:49.605
- Well. it's lovely.
- I'm so happy you guys are enjoying it.

1594
01:32:52.567 --> 01:32:54.569
Oh. um... Ah. could you...

1595
01:32:54.652 --> 01:32:55.570
Yeah. thanks.

1596
01:32:56.445 --> 01:32:59.031
Yeah. yeah. I know!

1597
01:33:05.454 --> 01:33:06.831
Well. Jesus Christ...

1598
01:33:13.588 --> 01:33:16.048
Where's Carter? He never misses a party.

1599
01:33:17.925 --> 01:33:21.512
Yeah. well. he got hung up on
a special assignment that I sent him on.

1600
01:33:21.596 --> 01:33:22.888
- It's more heavy...
- I knew it.

1601
01:33:23.806 --> 01:33:25.308
What have you been up to?

1602
01:33:25.975 --> 01:33:26.892
You'll see.

1603
01:33:27.393 --> 01:33:29.395
Gonna make a little announcement.

1604
01:33:36.569 --> 01:33:39.447
I still don't understand
why you dragged me out here.

1605
01:33:39.530 --> 01:33:40.656
Moe got tickets for this?

1606
01:33:40.740 --> 01:33:42.658
It's gonna be great. I promise.

1607
01:33:43.367 --> 01:33:44.368
Wait.

1608
01:33:45.036 --> 01:33:46.579
Baldwyn Wines?

1609
01:33:46.662 --> 01:33:49.790
Why would you bring me to the last place
on earth I would want to be?

1610
01:33:49.874 --> 01:33:51.917
Because I'm your friend.

1611
01:33:52.585 --> 01:33:55.838
And there's something
I think you need to see.

1612
01:33:56.839 --> 01:33:58.966
You are a sexy wine spy.

1613
01:34:04.347 --> 01:34:06.349
Oh. hey.

1614
01:34:06.432 --> 01:34:08.225
I am so glad you guys could make it.

1615
01:34:08.309 --> 01:34:10.227
Why are you dressed like a waiter?

1616
01:34:10.311 --> 01:34:11.145
Get comfy.

1617
01:34:11.228 --> 01:34:14.023
No matter how this goes.
I'm sure you're gonna be entertained.

1618
01:34:17.276 --> 01:34:19.153
Is everyone a sexy wine spy?

1619
01:34:24.533 --> 01:34:26.118
Yeah.

1620
01:34:41.759 --> 01:34:43.219
Ho. ho. ho!

1621
01:34:45.971 --> 01:34:50.893
Welcome. everyone. to the Baldwyn Wines
annual Christmas celebration.

1622
01:34:58.526 --> 01:35:00.319
Is everyone enjoying themselves?

1623
01:35:10.329 --> 01:35:13.082
Well. for Santa's first surprise...

1624
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.001
- Oh!
- Ta-da!

1625
01:35:20.673 --> 01:35:24.009
Mom. okay. I know what you're thinking.
but everything's gonna be just fine.

1626
01:35:24.093 --> 01:35:24.927
All right?

1627
01:35:33.978 --> 01:35:36.147
Just give me two more seconds.

1628
01:35:38.399 --> 01:35:40.359
This was easier in my mind.

1629
01:35:40.443 --> 01:35:41.402
Oh!

1630
01:35:49.410 --> 01:35:51.287
Okay. here we go.

1631
01:35:52.663 --> 01:35:57.042
As most of you in this room know.
I have had some bouts of

1632
01:35:57.835 --> 01:35:59.128
immaturity in the past.

1633
01:35:59.211 --> 01:36:02.465
No. no. it's true. It's true.

1634
01:36:02.548 --> 01:36:04.800
And I would like to apologize

1635
01:36:04.884 --> 01:36:07.845
to the groundskeepers
for some minor golf cart incidents.

1636
01:36:07.928 --> 01:36:11.390
to housekeeping
for the messes in my suite.

1637
01:36:11.474 --> 01:36:13.601
and as God as my witness.

1638
01:36:13.684 --> 01:36:14.977
I could've sworn

1639
01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:16.687
that peacocks could swim.

1640
01:36:16.771 --> 01:36:19.899
I don't know about that one.

1641
01:36:20.941 --> 01:36:22.234
But more than anyone.

1642
01:36:23.778 --> 01:36:26.071
I owe an apology to a lovely woman.

1643
01:36:26.155 --> 01:36:27.865
who. unfortunately.

1644
01:36:27.948 --> 01:36:29.575
got the worst of me.

1645
01:36:29.658 --> 01:36:31.410
Emma.

1646
01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:36.665
I am so sorry
for how I behaved towards you.

1647
01:36:36.749 --> 01:36:39.335
It was childish. and it was cowardly.

1648
01:36:40.336 --> 01:36:41.754
And you didn't deserve it.

1649
01:36:44.048 --> 01:36:46.967
And I hope you'll find it in your heart
to forgive me.

1650
01:36:53.516 --> 01:36:55.226
Aw!

1651
01:36:55.309 --> 01:36:56.644
Thank you for that.

1652
01:37:02.358 --> 01:37:03.776
Okay.

1653
01:37:03.859 --> 01:37:05.486
Uh. now on to business.

1654
01:37:05.569 --> 01:37:07.696
I hope everybody is enjoying the crudo.

1655
01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:09.990
the braised asparagus.
and the duck confit.

1656
01:37:10.074 --> 01:37:13.369
I think it pairs very nicely
with the wine selection of the evening.

1657
01:37:13.452 --> 01:37:15.704
The Chateau LeMenteur?

1658
01:37:15.788 --> 01:37:17.081
Is everybody digging it?

1659
01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:21.877
Only...

1660
01:37:22.962 --> 01:37:24.255
there's no such vineyard.

1661
01:37:24.338 --> 01:37:26.298
What's he talking about?

1662
01:37:29.343 --> 01:37:33.055
What you are actually drinking
is a bold cabernet

1663
01:37:33.138 --> 01:37:36.225
from Baldwyn Wines'
newly acquired vineyard.

1664
01:37:41.605 --> 01:37:43.649
That's Moe's wine.

1665
01:37:43.732 --> 01:37:45.067
Are you kidding me?

1666
01:37:45.150 --> 01:37:48.153
A vineyard that my mother... Huh?

1667
01:37:48.237 --> 01:37:49.530
She insisted on buying.

1668
01:37:50.739 --> 01:37:52.324
And she was right to do so.

1669
01:37:53.868 --> 01:37:54.743
I was?

1670
01:37:54.827 --> 01:37:58.080
- Margo. you are full of surprises.
- Yeah.

1671
01:38:00.708 --> 01:38:05.671
This year. I was hit with the ghosts
of Christmas past and present.

1672
01:38:06.422 --> 01:38:08.757
My mother sent me to Los Santos.

1673
01:38:08.841 --> 01:38:11.635
a place where this company got its start.

1674
01:38:11.719 --> 01:38:13.929
My grandfather. George Baldwyn.

1675
01:38:14.013 --> 01:38:16.807
bought land
with his partner Hollis Huckabee.

1676
01:38:16.891 --> 01:38:18.142
Their dream

1677
01:38:18.726 --> 01:38:22.605
was to produce small batch wines
to compete with the big market labels.

1678
01:38:23.689 --> 01:38:25.149
And while I was there.

1679
01:38:25.232 --> 01:38:28.903
I got to meet the people
and the winemakers of Los Santos.

1680
01:38:28.986 --> 01:38:30.988
Their passion for wine

1681
01:38:31.071 --> 01:38:35.159
and their spirit of community embodies
everything that my grandfather envisioned.

1682
01:38:38.621 --> 01:38:40.122
And I fell in love there too.

1683
01:38:40.205 --> 01:38:41.790
Aw.

1684
01:38:44.084 --> 01:38:45.252
He's talking about you.

1685
01:38:46.378 --> 01:38:48.297
- He's talking about everyone.
- No.

1686
01:38:48.964 --> 01:38:51.592
Tonight. you have also met them.

1687
01:38:51.675 --> 01:38:55.220
By enjoying a sample
of what they have to offer.

1688
01:38:55.304 --> 01:38:59.391
Bargain Barrel Baldwyn doesn't
have to be the legacy of Baldwyn Wines.

1689
01:39:02.561 --> 01:39:04.730
Dionysus always said

1690
01:39:05.314 --> 01:39:07.733
that wine should bring people together.

1691
01:39:07.816 --> 01:39:11.445
And if sometimes that means drinking
Bargain Barrel wines. then so be it.

1692
01:39:12.029 --> 01:39:13.155
But Baldwyn Wines

1693
01:39:13.238 --> 01:39:18.118
has a chance to embrace the amazing
artisan community of Los Santos

1694
01:39:18.744 --> 01:39:23.248
and carry a line of wines that all of us
can actually be proud to drink.

1695
01:39:23.332 --> 01:39:27.086
A premium.
small batch <i>garagiste</i> collection.

1696
01:39:28.796 --> 01:39:30.172
So what do you say?

1697
01:39:30.255 --> 01:39:33.300
Does Baldwyn Wines <i>garagiste</i> collection

1698
01:39:33.384 --> 01:39:37.930
belong on shelves everywhere
for everyone to enjoy?

1699
01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:42.434
Yes!

1700
01:39:46.689 --> 01:39:47.898
Woo!

1701
01:39:54.947 --> 01:39:56.448
It sounds like we have a winner.

1702
01:39:57.116 --> 01:39:59.243
Margo. I love this idea.

1703
01:39:59.326 --> 01:40:01.286
We should've done this a long time ago.

1704
01:40:01.787 --> 01:40:03.205
Merry Christmas. everyone.

1705
01:40:03.288 --> 01:40:05.499
And thank you so much
for coming out tonight.

1706
01:40:14.174 --> 01:40:15.509
We'll see.

1707
01:40:16.677 --> 01:40:19.263
So what'd you think of the speech?

1708
01:40:19.346 --> 01:40:20.806
A rumbling mess.

1709
01:40:20.889 --> 01:40:22.766
- Pretty sappy.
- Couldn't mention my name?

1710
01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:25.769
But we loved it.

1711
01:40:29.940 --> 01:40:30.899
Excuse me.

1712
01:40:34.153 --> 01:40:35.821
Uh. can you give me a second?

1713
01:40:39.950 --> 01:40:42.369
Well. Mother. what do you think?

1714
01:40:42.453 --> 01:40:45.289
Starting a new division
of Baldwyn Wines. huh?

1715
01:40:45.372 --> 01:40:46.248
That's right.

1716
01:40:46.331 --> 01:40:47.916
Sounds like a lot of work.

1717
01:40:48.625 --> 01:40:50.753
Who do you suppose
is gonna do all that work?

1718
01:40:51.336 --> 01:40:54.381
Well. if you let me.
I... I'd love to finish what I started.

1719
01:40:55.049 --> 01:40:57.176
Well. you know. finishing what you start

1720
01:40:57.259 --> 01:40:59.386
hasn't always been
your strong suit. honey.

1721
01:41:00.387 --> 01:41:01.263
You're right.

1722
01:41:02.056 --> 01:41:05.267
But I've realized that I've been so busy
running from everything

1723
01:41:05.350 --> 01:41:08.270
that I haven't taken the time
to figure out what I want to run towards.

1724
01:41:08.353 --> 01:41:09.521
And you think this is it?

1725
01:41:09.605 --> 01:41:10.522
I know it is.

1726
01:41:14.026 --> 01:41:17.071
I think your dad and your grandpa
would be very proud of you.

1727
01:41:19.031 --> 01:41:19.948
And you?

1728
01:41:20.657 --> 01:41:22.367
I mean. you've worked so hard.

1729
01:41:22.868 --> 01:41:24.828
Would this honor your legacy?

1730
01:41:25.788 --> 01:41:26.663
Sweetie...

1731
01:41:28.373 --> 01:41:32.002
my legacy isn't Bargain Barrel Baldwyn.

1732
01:41:32.836 --> 01:41:33.921
It never was.

1733
01:41:35.881 --> 01:41:37.257
My legacy is you.

1734
01:41:38.634 --> 01:41:40.385
I'm so proud of you.

1735
01:41:41.678 --> 01:41:44.681
- This feels like a... like a hug moment?
- Yes. it is. Come here!

1736
01:41:48.602 --> 01:41:49.478
I love you.

1737
01:41:49.561 --> 01:41:50.604
I love you too.

1738
01:41:53.107 --> 01:41:54.066
- Carter...
- I...

1739
01:41:54.608 --> 01:41:55.692
...go get your girl.

1740
01:42:02.825 --> 01:42:03.951
Are you serious?

1741
01:42:08.747 --> 01:42:09.581
You know.

1742
01:42:10.082 --> 01:42:13.377
it would be a shame
for anyone wearing a dress that well

1743
01:42:14.503 --> 01:42:15.879
not to dance in it.

1744
01:42:16.964 --> 01:42:17.840
Good idea.

1745
01:42:18.549 --> 01:42:19.925
Who should I ask to dance?

1746
01:42:21.969 --> 01:42:22.970
Oh. I don't know.

1747
01:42:23.762 --> 01:42:26.056
Maybe someone trying to work their way
off the naughty list?

1748
01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:32.020
Well. it is Christmas.

1749
01:42:34.731 --> 01:42:40.612
<i>âª Let's let the wine do the talking âª</i>

1750
01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:48.203
<i>âª So I can dance all night with you... âª</i>

1751
01:42:49.329 --> 01:42:50.581
Oh. Carter?

1752
01:42:51.748 --> 01:42:53.417
A little naughty is nice.

1753
01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:55.711
<i>âª Feel like dancing âª</i>

1754
01:42:55.794 --> 01:43:01.300
<i>âª Let's let the wine do the talking... âª</i>

1755
01:43:02.593 --> 01:43:05.596
Come on. Fernando. You got this.
It's just like the backyard.

1756
01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:08.473
- Okay. here goes.
- Woo!

1757
01:43:08.557 --> 01:43:09.683
There you go!

1758
01:43:11.768 --> 01:43:14.188
Look at me!

1759
01:43:14.897 --> 01:43:16.523
- Woo!
- Woo-hoo!

1760
01:43:18.567 --> 01:43:21.153
You need
to lower your stance. dude!

1761
01:43:21.236 --> 01:43:22.529
