00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.666
- Hello!
-  Hi!

4
00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:46.500
Hello. Presleys. I'm Barbara.

5
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.791
So nice to meet you.

6
00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:49.500
Nice to meet you!

7
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.458
I know. I know it's a little rough.

8
00:01:51.458 --> 00:01:54.333
but nothing
a little landscaping couldn't fix. right?

9
00:01:55.625 --> 00:01:57.500
- What about this porch?
-  Yeah.

10
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.125
Huh? Original everything.

11
00:02:01.083 --> 00:02:03.416
-  Everyone here?
-  Uh-huh.

12
00:02:03.416 --> 00:02:04.333
Ready?

13
00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:05.833
- Yeah. Let's see it.
- Okay.

14
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.875
Everything okay?

15
00:02:13.416 --> 00:02:16.833
Oh! Yes! Come in. Come in!

16
00:02:19.125 --> 00:02:21.083
Cleaning crew can't come until Tuesday.

17
00:02:21.583 --> 00:02:22.583
As you can see.

18
00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:26.583
the home has tons of old-world charm.

19
00:02:27.791 --> 00:02:30.291
The house was built in 1904.

20
00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:34.333
It's registered with the Illinois
Historic Preservation Society.

21
00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:36.208
Instant value added.

22
00:02:36.208 --> 00:02:38.958
And look at all the gorgeous...

23
00:02:41.541 --> 00:02:42.375
Where's Kevin?

29

30
00:03:01.083 --> 00:03:02.291
Do I have to?

31
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:03.666
Yes. you have to.

32
00:03:38.041 --> 00:03:39.750
Tons of closet space. huh?

33
00:03:41.083 --> 00:03:45.083
Primary bath. original fixtures and tile.

34
00:03:45.083 --> 00:03:48.375
Oh! And have you noticed
the high ceilings? I mean...

35
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.958
The house is just listed really low.

36
00:03:51.916 --> 00:03:54.583
And I know it's a fixer-upper. but still...

37
00:03:54.583 --> 00:03:58.666
- Nothing. like. bad happened here. right?

38
00:03:59.833 --> 00:04:02.083
Oh my...

39
00:04:03.875 --> 00:04:07.291
Oh my gosh. no.
It's just a buyer's market.

40
00:06:09.875 --> 00:06:11.166
Got ya. bitch.

41
00:06:11.166 --> 00:06:13.583
- Ha. ha. ha. You got me. Ha.

42
00:06:15.833 --> 00:06:17.541
- Were you there the whole time?
- Yeah.

43
00:06:17.541 --> 00:06:19.583
- Oh my God.
- It took you long enough.

44
00:06:19.583 --> 00:06:21.958
Got me messing up my drip
with all this dust.

45
00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:26.041
...little work. yard work
or anything like that.

46
00:06:26.041 --> 00:06:28.000
You know what I'm saying? Oh!

47
00:06:29.625 --> 00:06:31.916
Think we're gonna move here?

48
00:06:31.916 --> 00:06:33.458
Hell no. man.

49
00:06:33.458 --> 00:06:34.708
This place is a dump.

50
00:06:36.916 --> 00:06:39.125
Watch your right side.
Come in tight!

51
00:06:40.416 --> 00:06:42.250
No. no. no. Turn more.

52
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:43.750
Hey. wait! No. no. no!

53
00:06:44.833 --> 00:06:47.166
Hey. watch it! You hit the mailbox. man!

54
00:06:56.791 --> 00:07:00.083
There's ten more of those on the truck.
and they ain't moving themselves.

55
00:07:05.041 --> 00:07:05.958
Funny.

56
00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.083
Oi. Joy!

57
00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:43.583
Nasty.

58
00:07:44.166 --> 00:07:46.583
Nasty. Nasty.

59
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.750
- Nasty. Nasty.

60
00:07:50.416 --> 00:07:51.833
Nasty.

61
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.208
Ooh.

62
00:07:58.333 --> 00:07:59.458
What are you doing?

63
00:08:02.875 --> 00:08:04.833
Oh yeah.

64
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.416
Come on.

65
00:08:09.375 --> 00:08:11.708
- It's a dance party. man.

66
00:08:11.708 --> 00:08:13.291
Pick something good.

67
00:08:13.291 --> 00:08:15.625
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

68
00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:17.541
Come on. man. It's a dance party. Kev.

69
00:08:17.541 --> 00:08:19.625
Remember you used to dance
with your old man? Come on.

70
00:08:19.625 --> 00:08:21.375
-  Show me some of them moves.

71
00:08:21.375 --> 00:08:23.583
Come on. Look! Come on.

72
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:32.750
Come on. man.

73
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.291

77
00:08:48.083 --> 00:08:49.375
- After dinner.
- Mom!

78
00:08:49.375 --> 00:08:52.250
- I'm not getting in the middle of this.
- Yeah. of course not.

79
00:08:53.166 --> 00:08:55.041
Come on. Frank. Give me a break.

80
00:09:06.458 --> 00:09:10.625
So. what? You'd rather listen
to some old white dude play guitar?

81
00:09:12.041 --> 00:09:14.416
Terry Kath is one of the greatest
guitarists of all time.

82
00:09:14.416 --> 00:09:16.208
"Terry Kath
is one the greatest..."

83
00:09:16.208 --> 00:09:19.250
That's not true.
Jimi Hendrix is the greatest.

84
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:21.000
Oh. Did you read that in <i>Rolling Stone?</i>

85
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.083
No. it's a fact. Ask anybody.

86
00:09:23.083 --> 00:09:24.875
Or just ask Jimi Hendrix himself.

87
00:09:24.875 --> 00:09:27.541
He said Kath was his greatest inspiration.

88
00:09:27.541 --> 00:09:28.541
He was a genius.

89
00:09:28.541 --> 00:09:31.500
The dude accidentally
shot himself in the face.

90
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.750
A genius he is not.

91
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:35.833
Says the guy
reading a book for dummies.

92
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000
You know what?

93
00:09:52.375 --> 00:09:54.208
I'm sorry you're so unhappy.

94
00:09:55.458 --> 00:09:56.458
Okay?

95
00:09:56.458 --> 00:09:59.625
Now. we're all here
trying to get a fresh start.

96
00:10:01.333 --> 00:10:04.291
I'd appreciate it if you'd come at it
with a little bit more positivity.

97
00:10:04.875 --> 00:10:07.000
How many fresh starts are we at now. Dad?

98
00:10:08.666 --> 00:10:09.750
I lost count.

99
00:10:28.041 --> 00:10:28.916
What the hell. man?

100
00:10:30.541 --> 00:10:31.458
What?

101
00:10:32.791 --> 00:10:33.625
He started it.

102
00:12:53.583 --> 00:12:55.166
No. no. no. Wait. Don't go!

103
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:56.875
Shit.

104
00:12:59.833 --> 00:13:01.291
Holy shit.

105
00:13:11.333 --> 00:13:14.375
"Most entities have been
displaced by trauma."

106
00:13:14.375 --> 00:13:15.416
Psst!

107
00:13:16.166 --> 00:13:17.166
Hey!

108
00:13:17.666 --> 00:13:18.791
Yeah. you.

109
00:13:19.375 --> 00:13:21.250
Can you come in
and guard the door for a sec?

110
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:22.875
Come on.

111
00:13:30.083 --> 00:13:31.083
Um...

112
00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:34.583
I don't think
you're supposed to be doing that.

113
00:13:34.583 --> 00:13:36.625
Some racist douchebag
wrote my number down.

114
00:13:36.625 --> 00:13:39.541
I keep getting text messages
asking for free rice.

115
00:13:39.541 --> 00:13:40.750
- Free rice?

116
00:13:41.416 --> 00:13:43.666
Oh! You don't know?

117
00:13:43.666 --> 00:13:46.500
Asian people only eat rice.

118
00:13:48.041 --> 00:13:49.291
Why not just change your number?

119
00:13:49.291 --> 00:13:52.000
So. I should cave under the pressure
of institutionalized abuse?

120
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:52.958
Uh. no. I meant--

121
00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.666
Besides. do you know
how clutch this number is?

122
00:13:55.666 --> 00:13:57.250
222-POOP.

123
00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:00.708
Phone numbers that good
are. like. impossible to get.

124
00:14:00.708 --> 00:14:03.666
So. uh. I... I think we're neighbors.

125
00:14:03.666 --> 00:14:04.791
We are?

126
00:14:05.291 --> 00:14:06.541
Yeah. Um...

127
00:14:06.541 --> 00:14:09.041
My family just moved
into the house next to yours.

128
00:14:09.041 --> 00:14:11.166
You moved into the House of Death?

129
00:14:12.083 --> 00:14:14.125
- House of what?
- Everyone says it's haunted.

130
00:14:14.125 --> 00:14:16.958
I'm an atheist. so I'm not
supposed to believe in that kind of shit.

131
00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:20.375
but secretly. I'd love to die
and then. I don't know.

132
00:14:20.375 --> 00:14:23.000
come back as some fierce ghost
and haunt Ted Cruz.

133
00:14:24.083 --> 00:14:25.125
Anyway.

134
00:14:25.916 --> 00:14:30.541
Uh... Neighbor. we should hang.
What are you doing after school?

135
00:14:31.333 --> 00:14:32.791
Oh. um... After school...

136
00:14:32.791 --> 00:14:35.875
Well. I. um...
I have a lot... I have to study.

137
00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:38.791
- That's one thing I have to do. study.
- Cool.

138
00:14:38.791 --> 00:14:43.250
Okay. well. uh. I guess you know my number
in case you change your mind.

139
00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.500
Or if you need rice.

140
00:15:01.791 --> 00:15:02.958
Oh. what's with that face?

141
00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.041
-  How was your ride home?
- Great.

142
00:15:05.041 --> 00:15:07.125
How about you. Kevin?
How was your ride home?

143
00:15:07.125 --> 00:15:08.041
Good.

144
00:15:08.041 --> 00:15:10.125
- Fulton. give me your phone.
- Why?

145
00:15:10.125 --> 00:15:12.916
Susan said she saw your brother
walk to school this morning.

146
00:15:12.916 --> 00:15:14.708
You had one job.

147
00:15:14.708 --> 00:15:15.958
That's bullshit.

148
00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:16.916
Kevin.

149
00:15:17.666 --> 00:15:18.583
No comment.

150
00:15:26.208 --> 00:15:27.083

151
00:15:32.833 --> 00:15:34.125
It's me again.

152
00:15:36.208 --> 00:15:37.041

00:16:18.333 --> 00:16:19.208
Stop.

159
00:16:20.875 --> 00:16:22.125
It's not happening. bro.

160
00:16:23.708 --> 00:16:26.166
Listen. I know it... it probably worked
on everyone else before.

161
00:16:26.166 --> 00:16:29.708
but my personal life is. like.
1.000 times scarier than this.

162
00:16:34.875 --> 00:16:35.958

165
00:17:01.541 --> 00:17:05.250
I've only been bowling once
when I was. like. eight.

166
00:17:05.875 --> 00:17:08.541
My dad got into a fistfight
with the guy in the lane next to us

167
00:17:08.541 --> 00:17:10.375
over an order of buffalo wings.

168

They banned us for life.

Can you talk?

170
00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:23.958

171
00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:31.958

00:17:43.458 --> 00:17:44.791

175
00:17:51.791 --> 00:17:53.083

179
00:18:08.666 --> 00:18:10.500

180
00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:13.791
That's so trippy.

182
00:18:28.875 --> 00:18:29.750
So...

183
00:18:31.708 --> 00:18:35.500
we can't touch you. but you can touch us?

184
00:18:37.875 --> 00:18:38.791
Hmm.

185
00:18:40.083 --> 00:18:42.208
Kind of like a stripper.

186
00:18:44.583 --> 00:18:45.500
Kev!

187
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.250
I need your phone.

188
00:18:47.791 --> 00:18:49.541
Jeez. it's freezing in here. man.

189
00:18:50.875 --> 00:18:53.333
Yo. butt munch. Your phone. come on.

190
00:18:53.333 --> 00:18:54.583
Why? Why do you need my phone?

191
00:18:54.583 --> 00:18:57.875
Because. unlike you. I have friends.
It's your fault Mom took my phone away.

192
00:18:57.875 --> 00:19:00.208
Um. I didn't drop me
a mile away from school.

193
00:19:00.208 --> 00:19:02.708
- Okay. where is it? Right there? Where?
- No. Fulton.

194
00:19:02.708 --> 00:19:04.291
Stop! Fulton!

195
00:19:04.291 --> 00:19:06.583
Get off of me! Fulton!

196
00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:12.958
What the hell?

197
00:19:35.125 --> 00:19:36.875
Why are you in such a chipper mood?

198
00:19:37.666 --> 00:19:38.500
What?

199
00:19:41.333 --> 00:19:44.041
Am I not allowed
to be in a good mood?

200
00:19:44.041 --> 00:19:46.333
You can be in whatever mood you want.
You know.

201
00:19:46.333 --> 00:19:48.000
Good mood is good. It's just rare.

202
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.833
Hey. Let him have it.

203
00:19:51.458 --> 00:19:52.666
Thank you.

204
00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:54.416
Okay.

205
00:19:56.791 --> 00:19:59.000
<i>We know that every atom.</i>

206
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.833
<i>every molecule of the human body.
is composed of energy.</i>

207
00:20:03.833 --> 00:20:09.666
{\an8}<i>but what happens to that
human energy field when the body dies?</i>

208
00:20:09.666 --> 00:20:13.583
{\an8}<i>I believe that
that energy could be captured.</i>

209
00:20:13.583 --> 00:20:16.291
{\an8} <i>See the beyond.
Hear the beyond.</i>

210
00:20:16.291 --> 00:20:17.541
{\an8}<i>Be the beyond.</i>

211

-  What the hell is this?

213
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.750
What are you doing with my phone?

214
00:20:28.833 --> 00:20:30.708
- Fulton.
- Oh. you sneaky little bitch.

215
00:20:30.708 --> 00:20:32.208
Why you keeping this shit a secret?

216
00:20:32.208 --> 00:20:33.833
- Fulton. give it to me now!
- Hold on.

217
00:20:33.833 --> 00:20:35.250
Will you two knock it off?

218
00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:36.625
We have a ghost.

219
00:20:37.333 --> 00:20:38.458
- Okay.
- No. I'm serious.

220
00:20:38.458 --> 00:20:40.791
Kevin caught him on camera. Look.

221
00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.500
- That some kind of scary movie?
-  No.

222
00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:48.458
Hey. this is pretty good.
How'd you do this?

223
00:20:48.458 --> 00:20:49.666
I didn't do anything.

224
00:20:54.458 --> 00:20:55.666
Oh shit!

225
00:20:55.666 --> 00:20:57.833
- Oh. we gotta show Mom.
- No. no. no. no.

226
00:20:57.833 --> 00:20:59.791
- We can't tell her about this.
- Why not?

227
00:20:59.791 --> 00:21:02.125
Because she'll freak out. You know this.

228
00:21:02.875 --> 00:21:03.833
Come on. pinky swear.

229
00:21:08.208 --> 00:21:10.291
- Seriously?
- Get it up. Come on. pinky swear.

230
00:21:12.208 --> 00:21:13.500
-  Kiss it.
- I'm not gonna--

231
00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:14.583
Kiss it.

232
00:21:15.583 --> 00:21:17.125
- Good.

233
00:21:18.083 --> 00:21:20.791
- Can I have my phone back now?
- Yeah. Send me the video.

234
00:21:21.875 --> 00:21:23.458
- Why?
- Come on!

235
00:21:23.458 --> 00:21:26.791
Why's everything a production with you?
Just send me the video. please?

236
00:21:29.083 --> 00:21:30.291
Fine.

237
00:21:31.375 --> 00:21:32.666
- There.

238
00:21:32.666 --> 00:21:33.875
Got it. Thanks.

239
00:21:33.875 --> 00:21:35.958
Come on.

240
00:22:09.541 --> 00:22:12.416
"The little girl lay there
in quiet terror.

241
00:22:12.416 --> 00:22:14.458
the figure hovering over her bed."

242
00:22:14.458 --> 00:22:17.166
"And though the entity
had no discernible face.

243
00:22:17.166 --> 00:22:20.250
she knew it meant to do her harm."

244
00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:22.750
"In one sudden motion. it launched.

245
00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:25.250
covering her mouth. stopping the scream."

246
00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:27.041
"It smelled of peppermint and rot."

247
00:22:27.041 --> 00:22:27.958
Sh!

248
00:22:27.958 --> 00:22:30.833
"The world started spinning
before she blacked out."

249
00:22:31.333 --> 00:22:34.875
"When she finally awakened.
the entity was gone."

250
00:22:35.458 --> 00:22:37.041
"Of course. no one believed her."

251
00:22:37.041 --> 00:22:38.500
"She was a child."

252
00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:41.916
"It was just a dream.
An overactive imagination."

253
00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:44.625
"But the little girl knew the truth."

254
00:22:45.583 --> 00:22:49.291
"The spirit realm is real.
and it is dangerous."

255
00:22:54.916 --> 00:22:55.875
Thank you.

256
00:22:55.875 --> 00:22:57.916
Nobody believed me either.

257
00:22:57.916 --> 00:22:59.458
My ghost is still with me.

258
00:22:59.458 --> 00:23:02.750
He followed me home
from a Red Lobster six years ago.

259
00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:04.333
and I can't seem to shake him.

260
00:23:04.333 --> 00:23:05.708
Now. I have tried to--

261
00:23:05.708 --> 00:23:09.041
Excuse me! I'm having a conversation here!

262
00:23:10.708 --> 00:23:13.833
He's very possessive and a homosexual.

263
00:23:15.083 --> 00:23:16.375
I am so tired.

264
00:23:18.541 --> 00:23:19.541
Thank you.

265
00:23:21.458 --> 00:23:23.000
Oh God. please.

266
00:23:26.291 --> 00:23:27.416
Hi.

267
00:23:27.416 --> 00:23:29.916
Hey. have you seen that viral video
that's been going around?

268
00:23:29.916 --> 00:23:32.958
I don't do social media.
It makes me nauseous.

269
00:23:32.958 --> 00:23:34.750
Well. guy finds a ghost in his attic.

270
00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:38.083
And I don't know.
I mean. it looks... it looks pretty legit.

271
00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:41.000
They always are until they aren't.

272
00:23:46.458 --> 00:23:48.125
Oh. this... this isn't my book.

273
00:23:51.916 --> 00:23:52.750
Mm.

274
00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:54.083
It has over a thousand views.

275
00:23:54.083 --> 00:23:56.541
- Is that good?
-  Don't quit your day job.

276
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:05.541
"Cool graphics.
What are you using? Maya or ZBrush?"

277
00:24:05.541 --> 00:24:08.625
"Lame-balls. I've seen better stuff
on <i>Ghost Hunters."</i>

278
00:24:08.625 --> 00:24:10.416
- What?
- They think this is fake.

279
00:24:10.416 --> 00:24:11.625
Yeah. but it's real.

280
00:24:13.708 --> 00:24:16.625
Frank. Are you guys watching dirty stuff?
What are you watching?

281
00:24:16.625 --> 00:24:18.916
- Nothing.
- Dad posted a video of-- Ugh!

282
00:24:18.916 --> 00:24:21.083
- Fulton. I just bought those oranges!
-  God!

283
00:24:21.708 --> 00:24:23.875
Worried about the oranges. Cool.

284
00:24:23.875 --> 00:24:26.333
Organic fruit is expensive.
You guys are up to something.

285
00:24:26.333 --> 00:24:27.541
No. we're not.

286
00:24:27.541 --> 00:24:29.541
- Nothing.
- Hmm. Fishy. fishy.

287
00:24:35.958 --> 00:24:37.083
Snitches get stitches.

288
00:24:39.875 --> 00:24:41.333
- Let's do this.
- Yeah.

289
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:11.666
Hello?

290
00:25:14.041 --> 00:25:15.458
We don't mean you any harm.

291
00:25:16.041 --> 00:25:18.708
Wikia says you should speak
in a firm. commanding voice

292
00:25:18.708 --> 00:25:20.208
so the ghost knows you're in charge.

293
00:25:20.208 --> 00:25:21.125
Got it.

294
00:25:22.333 --> 00:25:23.916
Spirit of this house!

295
00:25:24.541 --> 00:25:26.000
- Show yourself!
- Yeah.

296
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.291
- Huh?

297
00:25:30.541 --> 00:25:31.500
Dad. look.

298
00:25:41.916 --> 00:25:43.000
Boo.

299
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.500
Oh my gosh.

300
00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:45.583
It's not funny. man.

301
00:25:45.583 --> 00:25:46.958
It's totally funny.

302
00:25:46.958 --> 00:25:48.666
You're gonna scare it away. dumbass.

303
00:25:48.666 --> 00:25:51.750
No. Your patronizing. crappy
exorcist act is scaring it away.

304
00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:56.083
Hey.

305
00:25:57.833 --> 00:25:58.750
It's me again.

306
00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:04.041
This is my... my dad. Frank.
and my brother. Fulton.

307
00:26:04.541 --> 00:26:05.500
What's up?

308
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:09.041
They wanna meet you.

309
00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:18.250
Lame.

310
00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:19.833
You know what? Hold on.

311
00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:21.458
I have an idea.

312
00:26:22.083 --> 00:26:23.125
Where are you going?

313
00:26:23.125 --> 00:26:24.583
He said he has an idea.

314
00:26:25.583 --> 00:26:27.958
What? He's gonna get the ghost
and bring him back up here?

315
00:26:30.416 --> 00:26:32.416
Oh. look at this fool.

316
00:26:32.416 --> 00:26:33.625
Shut up. dog face.

317
00:26:33.625 --> 00:26:35.750
I actually have a pretty attractive face.
Ask anybody.

318
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:37.083

This is huge.

346

- Hey. where do you think you're going?
- Out?

353
00:29:03.625 --> 00:29:05.375
- Uh. no. Not so fast.
- Mom!

354
00:29:05.375 --> 00:29:08.541

Not in the fine print.</i>

356
00:29:11.291 --> 00:29:14.083
Oh! Well. then you'll be hearing
from our lawyer.

357
00:29:14.083 --> 00:29:16.250
- We have a lawyer?
- Of course not. We're broke.

358
00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:18.083
- 27.000!
- Can I go?

359
00:29:18.083 --> 00:29:20.291
No! You were in on this whole thing!

360
00:29:20.291 --> 00:29:22.041
Dad made us promise.

361
00:29:22.041 --> 00:29:22.958
Oh my God. Frank.

362
00:29:22.958 --> 00:29:24.958
- I knew you were gonna freak out.
- Yes!

363
00:29:24.958 --> 00:29:27.666
Any rational human being would!

364
00:29:27.666 --> 00:29:30.083
We have a ghost in our attic!

365
00:29:30.083 --> 00:29:32.875
- Mel. I'm sorry. I should've--
- And then to hear it from someone else?

366
00:29:32.875 --> 00:29:37.208
Somebody who saw it on freaking YouTube?
What happened to communicating more?

367
00:29:37.791 --> 00:29:41.208
Wasn't that the point of sitting through
20 sessions with Dr. Mouth-breather?

368
00:29:41.208 --> 00:29:43.458
- Okay. I'm out.
- Kevin.

369
00:29:43.458 --> 00:29:46.083
30.000. I'm so getting laid for this.

370
00:29:46.083 --> 00:29:48.333
- Fulton!
- Get out of here.

371
00:29:53.416 --> 00:29:54.250
Mel. I'm sorry.

372
00:29:54.833 --> 00:29:57.166
- We are moving.
- No. Wait. no. No. no. no.

373
00:29:57.166 --> 00:29:58.791
- Wait. wait. wait.
- No. No. no. no. no.

374
00:29:58.791 --> 00:29:59.833
We are not gonna be like

375
00:29:59.833 --> 00:30:04.208
every stupid white family
in every horror film. We are leaving.

376
00:30:04.208 --> 00:30:06.375
Will you just hear me out? Please. listen.

377
00:30:08.083 --> 00:30:08.958
Mel.

378
00:30:11.083 --> 00:30:13.208
I don't think
you understand how big this is.

379
00:30:13.916 --> 00:30:17.666
We've captured something
no one else ever has. ever.

380
00:30:17.666 --> 00:30:19.541
in the history of the recorded world!

381
00:30:19.541 --> 00:30:21.166
This is not up for discussion. Frank!

382
00:30:21.166 --> 00:30:23.291
Okay. So who are you
gonna sell the house to. huh?

383
00:30:23.291 --> 00:30:26.375
Because every dollar we have
is wrapped up into this.

384
00:30:26.375 --> 00:30:28.500
Well. if it wasn't for you
and that stupid video--

385
00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:29.541
And that's my point.

386
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.208
That's money. baby.

387
00:30:32.875 --> 00:30:36.708
Look. you have guys out there right now
making millions on their channel

388
00:30:36.708 --> 00:30:40.750
by playing <i>Minecraft</i>
and lighting their farts on fire!

389
00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:43.208
And. Mel. we actually have a ghost!

390
00:30:47.375 --> 00:30:48.500
This feels like Houston.

391
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:51.916
Houston was a pyramid scheme.
That's different.

392
00:30:51.916 --> 00:30:53.375
This... this is real.

393
00:30:54.208 --> 00:30:57.125
This is our chance.
This could change everything.

394
00:30:59.625 --> 00:31:00.791
Mel.

395
00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:04.166
Look at me. baby. Please?

396
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Look.

397
00:31:11.333 --> 00:31:14.291
I just need to win once.

398
00:31:15.916 --> 00:31:17.000
Just once.

399
00:31:21.125 --> 00:31:22.625
You know this is crazy.

400
00:31:23.125 --> 00:31:24.000
Right?

401
00:31:33.958 --> 00:31:35.833
{\an8}<i>-That's not a ghost.
- Are you kidding me?</i>

402
00:31:35.833 --> 00:31:37.166
{\an8}<i>He just walked through the wall!</i>

403
00:31:40.708 --> 00:31:41.750
{\an8}<i>Oh Jesus!</i>

404
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:43.083
<i>- Nuh-uh!</i>

405
00:31:43.083 --> 00:31:44.208
{\an8}<i>What is this?</i>

406
00:31:59.791 --> 00:32:02.375
{\an8}<i>Ernest is fine!</i>

407
00:32:02.375 --> 00:32:03.291
{\an8}<i>Mmm!</i>

408
00:32:03.291 --> 00:32:05.916
<i>I do have a crush
on Ernest the ghost!</i>

409
00:32:05.916 --> 00:32:09.083
{\an8}<i>I had a dream last night
that Ernie impregnated me.</i>

410
00:32:09.083 --> 00:32:10.541
{\an8}<i>This is what our son looked like.</i>

411
00:32:10.541 --> 00:32:12.750
{\an8}<i>"Run into a wall like Ernest."</i>

412
00:32:13.708 --> 00:32:15.625
{\an8}<i>Oh my gosh. Okay.</i>

413
00:32:19.125 --> 00:32:21.833
{\an8}<i>-You good? You good... Dude. your face.</i>

414
00:32:21.833 --> 00:32:25.166
{\an8}<i>My name's Cory. and we're going
with the Ernest Challenge. Check me out.</i>

415
00:32:32.375 --> 00:32:34.666
{\an8}<i>Ghost rights are human rights. you guys.</i>

416
00:32:34.666 --> 00:32:36.125
{\an8}<i>Ghost rights.</i>

417
00:32:36.666 --> 00:32:38.000
{\an8}<i>What?</i>

418
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.208
{\an8}<i>Just because you're not made of matter.
it doesn't mean you don't matter.</i>

419
00:32:42.208 --> 00:32:44.041
<i>If you want rights. go to New Zealand.</i>

420
00:32:44.041 --> 00:32:46.958
<i>They'd love to have you.
but we're fine. Thank you very much.</i>

421
00:32:46.958 --> 00:32:48.666
<i>Also. COVID is not real.</i>

422
00:32:48.666 --> 00:32:49.666
{\an8}<i>Mental abuse!</i>

423
00:32:49.666 --> 00:32:51.916
{\an8}<i>I'm just out here
trying to normalize ghost love.</i>

424
00:32:51.916 --> 00:32:54.750
{\an8}<i>-They're among us.
- Light one up for my ghoulies.</i>

425
00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:57.625
{\an8}<i>-Who knew someone so dark...
- He's just living in the house.</i>

426
00:32:57.625 --> 00:32:59.333
<i>...could make me feel...</i>

427
00:33:13.416 --> 00:33:16.000
<i>It's a classic campfire tale.</i>

428
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.250
<i>A family moves into an old house
that has a ghost lurking in its halls.</i>

429
00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:24.458
<i>But for a family in Chicago.
that spooky scenario just became real.</i>

430
00:33:24.458 --> 00:33:28.250
<i>and they've got the YouTube videos
to prove it. Take a look.</i>

431
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:29.416
<i>Frank.</i>

432
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.291
<i>- What is this?</i>
-  <i>Uh...</i>

433
00:33:33.291 --> 00:33:34.208
<i>What?</i>

434
00:33:37.166 --> 00:33:39.541
<i>- It might be time to call the movers.</i>

435
00:33:40.666 --> 00:33:44.083
-  <i>My guests today have...</i>
- Holy shit.

436
00:33:45.666 --> 00:33:49.416
Make sure Anderson gets briefed
before we meet with Congressional Affairs.

437
00:33:49.416 --> 00:33:52.041
Are you chewing gum?
What else we got?

438
00:33:52.041 --> 00:33:54.833
- That woman called again. Leslie?
-  Agent Schipley!

439
00:33:54.833 --> 00:33:57.250
- Oh. Christ on a cracker.
<i>-</i> Agent Schipley.

440
00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:58.958
Leslie. What a lovely surprise.

441
00:33:58.958 --> 00:34:01.458
I've been calling your office
for the past three days.

442
00:34:01.458 --> 00:34:03.541
- Really? I didn't know.
- You saw this. right?

443
00:34:04.083 --> 00:34:05.791
- Uh. no clue.
- It's an RHE.

444
00:34:05.791 --> 00:34:09.208
Leslie. I really appreciate you coming
all the way down here. but--

445
00:34:09.208 --> 00:34:12.375
I ran prelim diagnostics.
I couldn't find any foreign artifacts.

446
00:34:13.291 --> 00:34:16.208
Digital forensics. clean. This one's real.

447
00:34:16.208 --> 00:34:18.041
We need to reopen Wizard Clip.

448
00:34:18.041 --> 00:34:21.500
That program was mothballed 20 years ago
and for a good reason.

449
00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.958
This is our chance
to prove once and for all

450
00:34:23.958 --> 00:34:26.625
that spectral phenomena
is not some fantasy.

451
00:34:26.625 --> 00:34:27.791
Let's go.

452
00:34:29.125 --> 00:34:31.125
- Thanks for coming down.
- Please! He's real!

453
00:34:31.125 --> 00:34:34.416
- Come with us. ma'am. Come on. ma'am.
- He's real! Agent Schipley!

454
00:34:35.041 --> 00:34:36.916
He's real! Please!

455
00:34:39.833 --> 00:34:40.958
What?

456
00:34:42.583 --> 00:34:45.916
This is crazy.
How you doing? Yo! What's up?

457
00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:49.958
This is insane.

458
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.250
Yo. what's up?
What's up? What's up?

459
00:34:55.791 --> 00:34:57.458
How do you feel about this ghost?

460
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.875
Can you tell us more about Ernest?

461
00:35:00.875 --> 00:35:04.791
Yo. one second! One second!
Okay. all right! Yo!

462
00:35:04.791 --> 00:35:07.583
Frank. please.
Frank. tell us. please. about the entity!

463
00:35:07.583 --> 00:35:09.833
- All right. okay. yeah.
- The supernatural entity. Ernest!

464
00:35:09.833 --> 00:35:11.666
When's the last time you saw Ernie?

465
00:35:12.833 --> 00:35:15.333
How do you respond
to those who say this is all a hoax?

466
00:35:15.333 --> 00:35:17.166
Uh. if you think it's a hoax. look around.

467
00:35:17.166 --> 00:35:19.583
- There's a lot of people here. I mean...
- Is your family safe?

468
00:35:19.583 --> 00:35:21.458
- Is the community safe?
- When's the last time...

469
00:35:21.458 --> 00:35:23.791
Of course they're safe.
I mean. he's a ghost.

470
00:35:25.458 --> 00:35:27.208
Hey. thank you. guys!

471
00:35:31.791 --> 00:35:34.458
Who is coming into my house?

472
00:35:34.458 --> 00:35:37.708
You guys have a lot of nerve!
This is a private re...

473
00:35:37.708 --> 00:35:38.916
Frank!

474
00:35:38.916 --> 00:35:40.458
- I know.
- This is insane.

475
00:35:40.458 --> 00:35:41.958
- I can't leave the house.

476
00:35:41.958 --> 00:35:43.083
It's not that bad.

477
00:35:43.083 --> 00:35:44.583
Whoa. not that bad?

478
00:35:44.583 --> 00:35:46.541
Someone tried
to crawl down the chimney today...

479
00:35:46.541 --> 00:35:49.250
- What?
- ...to get in. Yeah! They got stuck.

480
00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:51.791
- I had to call the fire department.

481
00:35:51.791 --> 00:35:54.666
Do you know how crazy that is
to have a human being in there?

482
00:35:54.666 --> 00:35:56.250
- It ain't Christm--

483
00:35:57.625 --> 00:35:58.791
- Jesus Christ.
- Ha!

484
00:35:58.791 --> 00:36:00.375
- Not funny.
- Oh...

485
00:36:00.375 --> 00:36:03.666
Hey. go away. or we're calling the cops.

486
00:36:05.666 --> 00:36:10.750
Everything I've read says that
memory loss is connected to trauma.

487
00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:13.000
It's a self-defense mechanism.

488
00:36:14.166 --> 00:36:17.791
We need visual stimuli
to help trigger your memory.

489
00:36:19.583 --> 00:36:20.541
Oh my God.

490
00:36:22.333 --> 00:36:23.208
No?

491
00:36:24.791 --> 00:36:25.875
It's creepy.

492
00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:33.625
It's one of Dad's failed business things.

493
00:36:33.625 --> 00:36:34.875
"Male enhancement pills."

494
00:36:34.875 --> 00:36:37.791
But instead of boners.
they just gave everyone diarrhea.

495
00:36:46.333 --> 00:36:47.416
Do you remember something?

496
00:36:53.291 --> 00:36:54.250
Okay. Okay.

497
00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:55.458
It's okay.

498
00:37:06.208 --> 00:37:07.583
Move out. move.

499
00:37:12.666 --> 00:37:14.833
- You know. there's ghosts everywhere!
- Look at him.

500
00:37:16.708 --> 00:37:17.833
He loves it.

501
00:37:19.083 --> 00:37:19.916
Wh...

502
00:37:26.083 --> 00:37:28.125
Why help?

503
00:37:28.708 --> 00:37:30.125
"Why"? Why. what?

504
00:37:42.791 --> 00:37:44.333
Why help you?

505
00:37:46.833 --> 00:37:48.083
'Cause you're stuck.

506
00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:52.375
Nobody wants to be stuck. right?

507
00:38:02.541 --> 00:38:03.958
- Hey. neighbor!

508
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000
That...

509
00:38:06.583 --> 00:38:07.583
That was loud.

510
00:38:07.583 --> 00:38:10.000
I've never understood
the whole "quiet-in-the-library" thing.

511
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.125
Like. what?
Noise makes you stupid?

512
00:38:13.125 --> 00:38:15.083
Anyway. how are you? How's the ghost?

513
00:38:15.666 --> 00:38:17.791
Our whole street's a shitshow.
thanks to you guys.

514
00:38:17.791 --> 00:38:20.208
My dad has the tow company on speed dial.

515
00:38:20.708 --> 00:38:22.083
It's kind of bad. actually.

516
00:38:22.083 --> 00:38:23.041
Oh.

517
00:38:24.166 --> 00:38:25.416
- Sorry.

518
00:38:27.333 --> 00:38:28.541
What are you working on?

519
00:38:29.083 --> 00:38:29.958
Uh...

520
00:38:29.958 --> 00:38:31.416
Ooh. Property records?

521
00:38:31.416 --> 00:38:32.541
Uh. yeah.

522
00:38:32.541 --> 00:38:36.250
I'm trying to see if Ernest
actually lived in our house

523
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:37.166
before he died.

524
00:38:37.166 --> 00:38:40.625
- He doesn't remember how he got there?
- He doesn't remember anything.

525
00:38:40.625 --> 00:38:42.250
Ooh. A mystery.

526
00:38:43.041 --> 00:38:44.666
Yeah. I'm just-- Oh.

527
00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:47.000
- Okay.

528
00:38:48.291 --> 00:38:49.750
Are you. like. a hacker or something?

529
00:38:52.958 --> 00:38:54.625
Ta-da! Mystery solved.

530
00:38:55.208 --> 00:38:56.208
Ernest Scheller.

531
00:38:56.208 --> 00:38:58.875
Bought the house April 5th. 1965.

532
00:38:58.875 --> 00:39:01.416
and sold it December 15th. 1971.

533
00:39:01.416 --> 00:39:03.166
- How did he die?
- Gimme a sec.

534
00:39:06.041 --> 00:39:08.333
Oh. Weird. There's no death certificate.

535
00:39:08.916 --> 00:39:10.583
- Pretty sure he's dead.
- You think?

536
00:39:13.041 --> 00:39:16.291
Sorry.
Looks like a dead end. Puns!

537
00:39:17.208 --> 00:39:19.875
Uh. I gotta run.
Band practice. But good luck.

538
00:39:20.875 --> 00:39:21.750
Thanks.

539
00:39:32.333 --> 00:39:34.375
-  Tina. here.

540
00:39:46.458 --> 00:39:49.500
{\an8}I... I don't wanna hurt your feelings
or anything. but I... I'm drawing the line.

541
00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:52.000
No more rest home readings.

542
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.916
The food always sucks.

543
00:39:53.916 --> 00:39:58.208
What about Kris Jenner? Doesn't she have
someone in her family that died recently?

544
00:39:58.875 --> 00:40:00.458
Her dog? I'm not--

545
00:40:00.458 --> 00:40:02.291
- Oh. Hey. Hi.
-  Hey.

546
00:40:02.291 --> 00:40:04.083
You know. I just... I gotta go. I gotta go.

547
00:40:04.083 --> 00:40:06.541
All right. Okay.
Okay. okay. I gotta go. Hey.

548
00:40:06.541 --> 00:40:09.291
- Hey! Hello. Hey!
- Hey.

549
00:40:09.291 --> 00:40:10.750
Oh my gosh.

550
00:40:11.333 --> 00:40:13.333
- You must be Frank.
-  Yeah.

551
00:40:13.333 --> 00:40:17.375
Everyone here at TSC is just thrilled
about you and everything happening.

552
00:40:17.375 --> 00:40:20.416
Well. we're really excited
to have you in our home.

553
00:40:20.416 --> 00:40:22.291
We're huge fans of the show.

554
00:40:22.291 --> 00:40:24.125
- Aw.
- We watch the show all the time.

555
00:40:24.125 --> 00:40:26.166
You're a gem.
You're a gem. You really are.

556
00:40:27.541 --> 00:40:30.208
Oh. and you're cute!

557
00:40:30.791 --> 00:40:32.833
Nobody said you were cute!

558
00:40:33.458 --> 00:40:34.291
Nobody.

559
00:40:34.291 --> 00:40:36.250
- Just wanna know. where's the wifey?

560
00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:38.125
Uh. she's somewhere getting ready.

561
00:40:38.125 --> 00:40:39.125
Good.

562
00:40:39.875 --> 00:40:40.916
Lock her up.

563
00:40:41.833 --> 00:40:44.875
That's right. And put her in a box
under the bed because

564
00:40:44.875 --> 00:40:46.166
you're mine.

565
00:40:51.583 --> 00:40:54.041
Well. can you make sure that

566
00:40:54.041 --> 00:40:56.166
"he's" ready for me?

567
00:40:57.291 --> 00:40:58.458
- Ernest!
- Yes!

568
00:40:58.458 --> 00:41:00.791
He's... he's good to go. We're ready. We...

569
00:41:00.791 --> 00:41:02.333
- We're cool.
-  Oh. good.

570
00:41:03.416 --> 00:41:05.375
Because I'm ready for him.

571
00:41:10.666 --> 00:41:12.208
Oh. Look. look. See?

572
00:41:14.875 --> 00:41:16.791
That's the kind of vibe you gotta work.

573
00:41:16.791 --> 00:41:18.708
Intensity. Visceral.

574
00:41:21.666 --> 00:41:23.500
- Where'd he go? Make him come back.
- Who?

575
00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:25.541
Kevin. don't play around.
I know he was here.

576
00:41:25.541 --> 00:41:26.833
He's not your lapdog.

577
00:41:26.833 --> 00:41:28.208
I didn't say he--

578
00:41:28.208 --> 00:41:30.791
Look. I got Judy Romano
in my living room right now. man.

579
00:41:30.791 --> 00:41:34.125
- I don't even know who that is.
- Yo. the West Bay Medium's downstairs!

580
00:41:34.125 --> 00:41:35.208
That's who it is!

581
00:41:36.916 --> 00:41:38.375
Why can't you just ask him yourself?

582
00:41:38.375 --> 00:41:39.625
Because he likes you.

583
00:41:39.625 --> 00:41:41.291
- He listens to you.

584
00:41:41.291 --> 00:41:43.875
Sorry to interrupt.
but we're ready for you downstairs.

585
00:41:43.875 --> 00:41:46.000
I'm so sorry. Thank you for your patience.

586
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.416
We'll be right down.

587
00:41:50.083 --> 00:41:52.500
Look. this is important. okay?

588
00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:55.583
Now. this show has a huge following.

589
00:41:55.583 --> 00:41:56.916
Now. if we nail this.

590
00:41:56.916 --> 00:41:59.916
I'm talking about book deals. merchandising...

591
00:41:59.916 --> 00:42:03.208
We could be the Black Kardashians.
Don't you wanna be Kim Kardashian?

592
00:42:08.291 --> 00:42:09.958
Okay.

593
00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:11.583
Anyway.

594
00:42:13.416 --> 00:42:15.041
- Fine.
- You'll talk to him?

595
00:42:15.041 --> 00:42:16.166
I'll try.

596
00:42:16.833 --> 00:42:18.750
My man.

597
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:24.750
Hey. Ernest.

598
00:42:27.208 --> 00:42:28.375
Ready to have some fun?

599
00:42:33.166 --> 00:42:34.041
Are we rolling?

600
00:42:34.041 --> 00:42:35.041
Oh!

601
00:42:39.166 --> 00:42:40.083
There.

602
00:42:41.041 --> 00:42:42.916
- Oh. So. Frank.

603
00:42:42.916 --> 00:42:49.000
The entire world right now is captivated
by your interactions with Ernest.

604
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:49.916
Yeah.

605
00:42:49.916 --> 00:42:53.458
You know. but there's
a fair amount of skepticism out there too.

606
00:42:53.458 --> 00:42:55.416
I mean. even myself. Even myself.

607
00:42:55.416 --> 00:42:56.333
I was like.

608
00:42:56.833 --> 00:42:59.333
"I don't think I believe
these videotapes." you know?

609
00:42:59.333 --> 00:43:03.916
But now that I am here.
right in this room.

610
00:43:03.916 --> 00:43:05.791
feeling what I'm feeling.

611
00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:09.875
I mean...
...it's all very palpable. isn't it. right?

612
00:43:09.875 --> 00:43:12.041
Yeah. Ernest is real.

613
00:43:12.041 --> 00:43:14.375
There's... there's no magic here.

614
00:43:14.375 --> 00:43:17.541
So... is he here now?

615
00:43:17.541 --> 00:43:21.750
He... he... he's coming. Right?

616
00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:24.708
He's just shy. you know?
There's a lot of... a lot of people.

617
00:43:24.708 --> 00:43:25.875
Uh-huh.

618
00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:32.500
Frank.

619
00:43:33.666 --> 00:43:35.708
Oh. Oh. Um...

620
00:43:36.333 --> 00:43:37.166
Uh...

621
00:43:38.208 --> 00:43:39.291
Ernest!

622
00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:41.791
You here. man?

623
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.916
-  Ernest. everyone's waiting.

624
00:43:47.916 --> 00:43:48.833
No.

625
00:43:48.833 --> 00:43:51.291
Okay. Okay.

626
00:43:51.291 --> 00:43:53.291
Listen. Frank. if you could just. uh.

627
00:43:53.291 --> 00:43:56.541
fix your little hologram machine. okay.
'cause I need to get outta here.

628
00:43:56.541 --> 00:44:00.166
No. no. no. There is no hologram.
He's...

629
00:44:01.666 --> 00:44:02.750
Ernest!

630
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:04.375
- We're outta here.
- No. wait.

631
00:44:04.375 --> 00:44:06.458
-  We're done.
-  Stop. no. Stop. please.

632
00:44:06.458 --> 00:44:08.041
Just... just wait. please?

633
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:46.750
Hey.

634
00:44:47.333 --> 00:44:48.750
Great production value. Frank.

635
00:44:49.458 --> 00:44:51.083
- What?

636
00:45:28.916 --> 00:45:30.750
- Do something!

637
00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:32.625
- What am I supposed to do?
- Tell him to stop!

638
00:45:32.625 --> 00:45:33.791
Oh God!

639
00:45:34.833 --> 00:45:37.083
I gotta get out of basic cable.

640
00:45:37.083 --> 00:45:38.791
It's just so unprofesh.

641
00:45:53.875 --> 00:45:55.833
What the...

642
00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:09.416
Oh. You again.

643
00:46:14.208 --> 00:46:18.541
Yeah. you know what?
On second thought. Tupac was better.

644
00:46:18.541 --> 00:46:20.666
Yeah. I'm gonna have to fix you in post.

645
00:46:58.500 --> 00:46:59.875
This is a disaster.

646
00:47:00.458 --> 00:47:02.208
They wanted a ghost. They got a ghost.

647
00:47:02.208 --> 00:47:04.625
Yeah. they wanted a ghost.
and we gave 'em <i>The Conjuring</i>.

648
00:47:05.625 --> 00:47:07.875
Oh. it's funny to you. huh?
Everything's a joke to you.

649
00:47:09.416 --> 00:47:10.541
Fulton. not now. man.

650
00:47:10.541 --> 00:47:12.250
We're getting tons of views
on the new video.

651
00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:14.875
- You posted it without my permission?
- Yeah. so?

652
00:47:14.875 --> 00:47:16.291
I'mma get sued. man!

653
00:47:18.833 --> 00:47:20.916
Three million views in six minutes.

654
00:47:21.541 --> 00:47:23.083
- That's gotta be a record. right?
- Mm.

655
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:25.291
Good work. man!

656
00:47:25.291 --> 00:47:28.125

- Not here. Come on.
- What?

667
00:48:15.083 --> 00:48:16.208
Sorry. Need a minute.

668
00:48:16.208 --> 00:48:17.333
You can't be in here.

669
00:48:17.333 --> 00:48:20.541
Says who? Your stupid gender norms?
Beat it. roach!

670
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.958
Joy. what the hell?
Are you losing your mind?

671
00:48:26.958 --> 00:48:29.041
No. but prepare to lose yours.

672
00:48:37.458 --> 00:48:38.541
It's not him.

673
00:48:38.541 --> 00:48:40.875
Yeah. but that's why we couldn't find
a death certificate.

674
00:48:41.666 --> 00:48:43.416
Ernest Scheller isn't dead.

675
00:48:44.416 --> 00:48:46.166
That guy used to live
in your house though.

676
00:48:46.166 --> 00:48:48.541
I cross-referenced. like.
a bunch of records to make sure.

677
00:48:48.541 --> 00:48:50.333
- So. who's our Ernest?
- Mmm.

678
00:48:51.208 --> 00:48:53.416
But I bet my left nut
that guy knows who he is.

679
00:48:53.416 --> 00:48:56.458
- You bet your what?
- That Ernest lives somewhere in Oklahoma.

680
00:48:56.458 --> 00:48:58.291
I'm still trying to find out where.

681
00:48:58.291 --> 00:49:01.750
But he used to own this dive bar
that's still around.

682
00:49:02.791 --> 00:49:04.416
Oh shit! That's like a mile from us.

683
00:49:04.416 --> 00:49:06.708
Yeah. I know. What if we took him there?

684
00:49:06.708 --> 00:49:07.666
Who?

685
00:49:08.791 --> 00:49:10.250
- Our Ernest?
- Yeah.

686
00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:11.708
Maybe they knew each other.

687
00:49:11.708 --> 00:49:14.041
Maybe it was like a hangout.
and there's a trigger there.

688
00:49:14.041 --> 00:49:16.083
Joy. he can't leave the house.

689
00:49:16.708 --> 00:49:18.666
He... He's stuck there.

690
00:49:19.625 --> 00:49:20.458
Are you sure?

691
00:49:24.291 --> 00:49:28.416
- Ernest! I love you. Ernest!

692
00:49:34.833 --> 00:49:37.666
Nonexclusive?
Are you kidding me. man?

693
00:49:37.666 --> 00:49:40.458
Look. I'm already runnin' original content
through my channel

694
00:49:40.458 --> 00:49:43.541
and making three times what you offered.
so think about what you just said.

695
00:49:43.541 --> 00:49:46.500
Think of a number and call me back.
all right? Bye.

696
00:49:48.458 --> 00:49:49.958
Frank. can you get the door. please?

697
00:49:49.958 --> 00:49:52.791
No. look. I'm serious.
Like. an Ernest cartoon would be amazing.

698
00:49:52.791 --> 00:49:54.750
But I want it to be
something like Adult Swim.

699
00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:57.666
Have you ever seen a naked ghost?
I haven't. What would that look like?

700
00:49:58.583 --> 00:50:01.791
- Frank. are you gonna get the door?
- What parts would a naked ghost have?

701
00:50:04.791 --> 00:50:06.166
Okay. I'm coming!

702
00:50:10.375 --> 00:50:12.791
- Sorry. We're not talking to the press.

703
00:50:16.625 --> 00:50:18.875
Just a few minutes of your time.
if I may. please?

704
00:50:20.208 --> 00:50:22.958
And Joy was doing all this research.

705
00:50:22.958 --> 00:50:26.375
Found out that the guy who lived here
used to own a bar not too far from here.

706
00:50:26.375 --> 00:50:29.125
So we figured.
if we could get you to the bar.

707
00:50:29.125 --> 00:50:30.625
maybe you'd remember something.

708
00:50:30.625 --> 00:50:32.291
Oh!

709
00:50:32.291 --> 00:50:33.541
Joy.

710
00:50:34.125 --> 00:50:35.125
Come on.

711
00:50:36.625 --> 00:50:38.125
You're right. Sorry.

712
00:50:39.708 --> 00:50:41.833
Okay. so we figured
that if we could get...

713
00:50:44.333 --> 00:50:46.416
It's so cold!

714
00:50:47.833 --> 00:50:49.208
Oh my God. I'm sorry. It's...

715
00:50:49.208 --> 00:50:50.833
I love this. I'm-- I'm a fan.

716
00:50:50.833 --> 00:50:52.708
I just-- I know I'm being annoying.

717
00:50:52.708 --> 00:50:55.375
Just. this is a thing
that's actually happening. and...

718
00:50:56.916 --> 00:50:59.041
Sorry.

719
00:51:00.083 --> 00:51:00.916
Anyway.

720
00:51:02.291 --> 00:51:03.500
We need to get you outside.

721
00:51:04.916 --> 00:51:06.875
Are you sure you can't leave?

722
00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:14.416
Have you tried?

723
00:51:16.416 --> 00:51:17.625
I mean. really tried.

724
00:51:20.666 --> 00:51:21.500
Okay.

725
00:51:23.666 --> 00:51:24.708
Listen. Ernest.

726
00:51:26.291 --> 00:51:27.166
I get it.

727
00:51:27.833 --> 00:51:30.958
You've been here a long time.

728
00:51:30.958 --> 00:51:33.916
and the world is such a scary place.

729
00:51:35.416 --> 00:51:38.666
Believe me. sometimes it terrifies me too.

730
00:51:39.958 --> 00:51:42.125
but there aren't any answers
left in this house.

731
00:51:42.833 --> 00:51:45.208
If we're gonna find out who you are...

732
00:51:47.083 --> 00:51:48.333
what happened to you...

733
00:51:50.708 --> 00:51:51.916
it's out there.

734
00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:58.333
I am so sorry to come over here uninvited.

735
00:51:58.333 --> 00:52:01.958
- I would've called. you know. but--
- Sorry. What's the point of this visit?

736
00:52:03.916 --> 00:52:07.500
Back in the late '90s.
I was recruited by the CIA

737
00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:11.750
to spearhead a program called Wizard Clip.

738
00:52:12.875 --> 00:52:13.791
Wizard Clip?

739
00:52:14.875 --> 00:52:18.708
Is that like. y'all just get high
and watch Harry Potter movies and...

740
00:52:18.708 --> 00:52:19.625
Babe.

741
00:52:19.625 --> 00:52:21.541
Wizard Clip was a textbook spook op.

742
00:52:21.541 --> 00:52:24.375
hidden from most echelons
of the government.

743
00:52:24.375 --> 00:52:26.833
Our field was paranormal psychology.

744
00:52:26.833 --> 00:52:31.291
but our orders were
to find and apprehend a ghost.

745
00:52:35.541 --> 00:52:37.666
There's nothing to be afraid of.
I promise.

746
00:52:38.208 --> 00:52:39.125
Okay?

747
00:52:57.875 --> 00:53:00.375
Hey. Hey. hey. hey. Hey.

748
00:53:00.375 --> 00:53:02.291
Listen to me. Listen.

749
00:53:04.333 --> 00:53:06.291
You're not alone anymore. Ernest.

750
00:53:07.875 --> 00:53:10.125
I'm right here with you
every step of the way.

751
00:53:12.166 --> 00:53:13.250
You got this.

752
00:54:04.916 --> 00:54:06.875
Soon as word got out that

753
00:54:06.875 --> 00:54:12.125
millions of taxpayers' dollars
were being spent on woo-woo science.

754
00:54:12.625 --> 00:54:14.750
we were abruptly shut down.

755
00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:18.583
and the agency
threw me under the proverbial bus.

756
00:54:20.208 --> 00:54:21.666
A sacrificial lamb.

757
00:54:22.291 --> 00:54:23.541
It was soul-crushing.

758
00:54:27.458 --> 00:54:29.708
But then along came Ernest.

759
00:54:29.708 --> 00:54:34.041
Okay. Thank you so much for coming over.
but as you can see. we are busy.

760
00:54:35.041 --> 00:54:36.041
I'd like to see him.

761
00:54:36.041 --> 00:54:37.458
That's not gonna happen.

762
00:54:38.208 --> 00:54:41.625
I don't think you understand
the gravity of your situation.

763
00:54:41.625 --> 00:54:44.000
These entities. they are dangerous.

764
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.458
I'd like you to leave. please.

765
00:54:45.458 --> 00:54:48.916
They may present kindly.
but they are never who they say they are.

766
00:54:48.916 --> 00:54:51.750
- I'm not gonna ask you--
- Your son Kevin.

767
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:54.416
He's close to it.
I've seen it in the videos. He's at risk!

768
00:54:54.416 --> 00:54:56.041
All right! That's enough! Now. get out!

769
00:54:56.041 --> 00:54:59.458
This is a matter of national security.
I have a right to be here.

770
00:54:59.458 --> 00:55:01.208
Then come back with a warrant.

771
00:55:01.208 --> 00:55:04.875
But until that time.
get the hell out of my house.

772
00:55:11.041 --> 00:55:11.958
I'll be back.

773
00:55:12.833 --> 00:55:13.666
That's a promise.

774
00:55:28.666 --> 00:55:29.541
It's him!

775
00:55:29.541 --> 00:55:30.708
Shit!

776
00:55:30.708 --> 00:55:32.958
Oh my God! It's him! It's Ernest!

777
00:55:32.958 --> 00:55:34.541
- It's him!

778
00:55:47.333 --> 00:55:48.666
Ernest! Ernest!

779
00:56:20.375 --> 00:56:21.666
Shit!

780
00:56:26.083 --> 00:56:26.916
Dick move!

781
00:56:26.916 --> 00:56:27.833
Come on.

782
00:56:28.625 --> 00:56:29.500
In there!

Hey!

795
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:23.250
Okay. whatever. Can you just
make yourself invisible already?

796
00:57:25.291 --> 00:57:27.166
What?
Why didn't he do that sooner?

797
00:57:27.166 --> 00:57:29.000
I don't know. Come on. We gotta go.

798
00:57:29.916 --> 00:57:31.083
This is bullshit.

799
00:57:31.083 --> 00:57:33.791
Well... [moans] ...I hate to remind you

800
00:57:33.791 --> 00:57:36.000
about a little thing
called the Fourth Amendment.

801
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.625
They're harboring a terrorist.

802
00:57:37.625 --> 00:57:41.875
I'm not sure a ghost
would legally qualify as a terrorist.

803
00:57:44.625 --> 00:57:46.208
They'll make a mistake.

804
00:57:48.125 --> 00:57:50.333
Careless people always do.

805
00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:55.041
And when that happens...

806
00:57:57.625 --> 00:57:58.791
we'll be ready.

807
00:58:11.291 --> 00:58:13.416
Chuck E. Cheese
is down the street. kiddos.

808
00:58:13.958 --> 00:58:16.666
Do you know this guy?
He used to work here back in the day.

809
00:58:16.666 --> 00:58:18.833
This place has had over a dozen owners.

810
00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:21.125
Can't we just look around for a minute?

811
00:58:21.125 --> 00:58:24.541
Sweetie. I could lose my liquor license.
You gotta go.

812
00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:28.458
Come on. This is stupid. Let's just go.

813
00:58:32.208 --> 00:58:34.208
Hey. wait.

814
00:58:35.666 --> 00:58:37.166
Let me see that picture again.

815
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:45.833
There.

816
00:58:52.041 --> 00:58:52.875
Oh my God.

817
00:58:57.041 --> 00:58:59.333
See? There is a connection.

818
00:58:59.333 --> 00:59:00.250
I knew it.

819
00:59:01.125 --> 00:59:03.166
Hold on. You're that kid. aren't you?

820
00:59:03.166 --> 00:59:05.666
Uh. I'm sorry. I don't...
I don't know what you're talking about.

821
00:59:05.666 --> 00:59:08.041
With the ghost in your house.
It is you! Holy shit!

822
00:59:08.041 --> 00:59:10.333
Okay. thank you for your time.
We have to go.

823
00:59:12.250 --> 00:59:13.375
You're a genius.

824
00:59:13.958 --> 00:59:16.458
This Scheller guy
has to know who Ernest really is.

825
00:59:16.458 --> 00:59:18.625
And to think that you doubted me.

826
00:59:18.625 --> 00:59:19.833
I never doubted you.

827
00:59:20.333 --> 00:59:22.458
- Now we just have to find where he is.
-  Mom!

828
00:59:22.458 --> 00:59:24.083
There's a ghost over there!

829
00:59:24.625 --> 00:59:26.125
That's nice. sweetie.

830
00:59:28.541 --> 00:59:29.375
Ernest.

831
00:59:31.041 --> 00:59:32.500
Ernest. what's wrong?

832
00:59:35.625 --> 00:59:36.583
Ernest.

833
00:59:42.416 --> 00:59:44.000
-  Ernest!

834
00:59:48.625 --> 00:59:49.541
Ernest!

835
00:59:59.666 --> 01:00:01.375
Hi. Daddy.

836
01:00:05.125 --> 01:00:06.208
Junebug.

837
01:00:14.791 --> 01:00:16.083
Shit.

838
01:00:16.083 --> 01:00:17.875
Mom!

839
01:00:20.041 --> 01:00:22.291
Ernest. come on! We gotta go!

840
01:00:22.833 --> 01:00:23.708
Ernest!

841
01:00:25.791 --> 01:00:26.916
Ernest!

842
01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:29.541
<i>Ernest!</i>

843
01:00:34.541 --> 01:00:36.291
<i>Ernest. come on! We gotta go!</i>

844
01:00:40.166 --> 01:00:42.791
I think a warrant just fell
right into our lap.

845
01:00:44.791 --> 01:00:46.541
"Ernest The Not-So-Friendly Ghost."

846
01:00:46.541 --> 01:00:48.958
"Paranormal Whacktivity."

847
01:00:48.958 --> 01:00:50.416
They think he's a monster now.

848
01:00:50.416 --> 01:00:53.833
He saw something out there.
Like he was remembering something.

849
01:00:53.833 --> 01:00:56.500
Well. it looks like
he's trying to kidnap Shirley Temple!

850
01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:58.416
And why didn't you tell me
he could go outside?

851
01:00:58.416 --> 01:01:00.000
That should've been my exclusive.

852
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.500
You're not listening to me.

853
01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:02.666
He said a name.

854
01:01:02.666 --> 01:01:05.333
it was. uh. June something.

855
01:01:05.333 --> 01:01:07.541
- So what?
- So maybe that's why he's stuck here.

856
01:01:08.541 --> 01:01:10.791
Something happened to him. Something bad.

857
01:01:10.791 --> 01:01:15.083
Maybe if we help him remember more.
he can. uh. cross over.

858
01:01:15.083 --> 01:01:16.500
Cross over?

859
01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:20.833
We don't want him to cross over. Kevin.
We need him here with us.

860
01:01:22.041 --> 01:01:23.875
You really
don't give a shit about him. do you?

861
01:01:23.875 --> 01:01:26.916
I give a shit about us!
This is about our future.

862
01:01:26.916 --> 01:01:30.041
This is about Fulton's college tuition.
It's about yours.

863
01:01:30.041 --> 01:01:31.375
Don't make this about us.

864
01:01:32.625 --> 01:01:33.708
It's about you.

865
01:01:34.541 --> 01:01:35.750
Always is.

866
01:01:36.375 --> 01:01:38.333
Hey. I'm not finished talking to you. man.

867
01:01:45.250 --> 01:01:46.833
You didn't hear a word he said.

868
01:02:15.291 --> 01:02:16.833
Hello. ladies.

869
01:02:20.125 --> 01:02:23.375
Dude. I just hit 200K followers
on Instagram. It's insane.

870
01:02:23.375 --> 01:02:24.333
<i>Seriously?</i>

871
01:02:24.333 --> 01:02:28.041
Everybody at school is so jealous.
but I didn't choose to be this hot.

01:15:19.416 --> 01:15:21.250
This is really a thing. huh?

1047
01:15:23.375 --> 01:15:25.291
<i>Wow. Look at this.</i>

1048
01:15:25.291 --> 01:15:28.416
Look. it's not too late
for you to get out of this.

1049
01:15:28.416 --> 01:15:29.375
What?

1050
01:15:30.375 --> 01:15:32.375
I mean. everyone thinks you're kidnapped.

1051
01:15:33.083 --> 01:15:35.708
You could just pretend you got away.

1052
01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:37.791
Wait.

1053
01:15:39.541 --> 01:15:41.375
You're saying I should just ditch you?

1054
01:15:42.041 --> 01:15:44.416
- Why would I do that?
- So you don't go to jail. maybe?

1055
01:15:45.375 --> 01:15:46.791
It's a good reason.

1056
01:15:46.791 --> 01:15:48.041
Are you kidding?

1057
01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:49.791
I was already in jail.

1058
01:15:50.833 --> 01:15:54.500
Band. AP classes.
math tutoring. choir practice.

1059
01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:59.041
My dad's programmed every second
of my life. and it's exhausting.

1060
01:15:59.041 --> 01:16:01.250
At least your dad cares.

1061
01:16:02.083 --> 01:16:03.291
It's a culture thing.

1062
01:16:03.958 --> 01:16:05.541
We have to be the best.

1063
01:16:06.250 --> 01:16:08.875
Prove that we belong. It's bullshit.

1064
01:16:09.708 --> 01:16:12.791
Sometimes it just seems
like he doesn't even know me.

1065
01:16:14.125 --> 01:16:17.041
He just sees this fake version of me
that he created.

1066
01:16:17.041 --> 01:16:20.041
I don't know.
I guess it's what a lot of parents do.

1067
01:16:20.875 --> 01:16:25.708
Try and fix themselves through their kids.
but they just mess 'em up more in the end.

1068
01:16:27.208 --> 01:16:31.833
The sad thing is me and my dad were
actually best friends when I was a kid.

1069
01:16:33.708 --> 01:16:34.708
I miss that.

1070
01:16:36.291 --> 01:16:37.125
What happened?

1071
01:16:37.958 --> 01:16:39.833
I don't know. It...

1072
01:16:41.083 --> 01:16:45.916
It wasn't just one thing. It was. like.
a bunch of things over time. and...

1073
01:16:47.625 --> 01:16:48.708
us moving around a lot.

1074
01:16:49.333 --> 01:16:53.541
him promising things to my mom
that just never happened.

1075
01:16:55.208 --> 01:16:56.875
Seeing how much it would hurt her.

1076
01:16:57.708 --> 01:16:59.583
After a while. I just pulled away.

1077
01:17:01.875 --> 01:17:04.375
Sometimes I feel like
I'm not even his son anymore.

1078
01:17:16.083 --> 01:17:17.000
What?

1079
01:17:18.791 --> 01:17:19.708
You're just...

1080
01:17:21.291 --> 01:17:22.583
You're really cool.

1081
01:17:25.333 --> 01:17:26.500
Thank you for helping us.

1082
01:17:31.041 --> 01:17:32.875
<i>♪ My darling. I ♪</i>

1083
01:17:34.541 --> 01:17:36.791
<i>♪ Can't get enough of your love. babe... ♪</i>

1084
01:17:37.583 --> 01:17:39.500
I have to go
to the restroom.

1085
01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:40.750
- Okay.
- Just one sec.

1086
01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:41.666
Yeah.

1087
01:17:43.208 --> 01:17:45.666
<i>♪ I can't get enough of your love. babe ♪</i>

1088
01:17:46.416 --> 01:17:47.291
Ernest.

1089
01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:51.583
Would you knock it off?

1090
01:17:52.166 --> 01:17:53.583
Ernest. stop.

1091
01:17:53.583 --> 01:17:55.416
Ernest. Listen to me.

1092
01:17:55.416 --> 01:17:57.916
- What are you doing? Stop. Ernest.

1093
01:18:00.666 --> 01:18:02.541
- What? What is this?
- Ah!

1094
01:18:03.083 --> 01:18:03.916
What?

1095
01:18:04.958 --> 01:18:05.875
Stop. Ernest!

1096
01:18:07.583 --> 01:18:09.750
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

1097
01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:11.000
Yeah. [clears throat] Yeah.

1098
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.541
Uh. everything's fine.

1099
01:18:46.625 --> 01:18:48.125
Go away.

1100
01:19:23.291 --> 01:19:24.208
I'll stay here.

1101
01:19:25.083 --> 01:19:26.083
Keep a lookout.

1102
01:19:27.916 --> 01:19:30.125
Honk the horn
if you see anything suspicious.

1103
01:19:31.916 --> 01:19:33.250
Stay out of sight. okay?

1104
01:20:10.291 --> 01:20:11.250
Hi.

1105
01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:14.083
Are you Ernest Scheller?

1106
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:17.958
- I'm--
- I know who you are. Come in.

1107
01:20:26.625 --> 01:20:28.500
That's my wife. Ramona.

1108
01:20:30.166 --> 01:20:32.833
Suffered a stroke last year.

1109
01:20:32.833 --> 01:20:35.000
Can't really do much these days.

1110
01:20:37.333 --> 01:20:38.500
Have a seat.

1111
01:20:44.791 --> 01:20:47.291
Can I get you something to drink?

1112
01:20:47.291 --> 01:20:51.083
Um. juice. pop. pineapple juice?

1113
01:20:51.083 --> 01:20:53.750
Ramona loves pineapple juice.

1114
01:20:54.375 --> 01:20:55.500
Whatever you want.

1115
01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:57.666
No. no. No. I'm fine.

1116
01:20:58.458 --> 01:20:59.500
Okay.

1117
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.625
Funny thing. I. uh...

1118
01:21:06.666 --> 01:21:10.666
I was in a bowling league ages ago.

1119
01:21:12.250 --> 01:21:14.583
One day. I can't find my shirt.

1120
01:21:15.291 --> 01:21:16.916
I looked high and low.

1121
01:21:17.958 --> 01:21:21.083
Ramona said I was always losing things.

1122
01:21:21.083 --> 01:21:24.916
even the damn shirt
off my own back. but. uh...

1123
01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:28.625
I knew something wasn't right.

1124
01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:33.791
I didn't see that shirt again

1125
01:21:33.791 --> 01:21:38.333
till a couple of weeks ago
when I saw one of your videos on the TV.

1126
01:21:40.041 --> 01:21:44.166
Well. I've seen
some crazy things in my life. but this...

1127
01:21:46.333 --> 01:21:49.166
I really can't believe this is real.

1128
01:21:54.875 --> 01:21:57.958
His name was Randy. Randy McGovern.

1129
01:21:57.958 --> 01:22:01.958
That woman next to him
was my wife's sister. Evelyn.

1130
01:22:01.958 --> 01:22:04.375
Dear. kind woman.

1131
01:22:04.375 --> 01:22:07.583
She died from. uh. complications in labor.

1132
01:22:07.583 --> 01:22:08.500
He had a child?

1133
01:22:09.625 --> 01:22:11.291
Daughter. June.

1134
01:22:13.250 --> 01:22:14.083
Junebug.

1135
01:22:16.208 --> 01:22:17.750
Randy. what happened to him?

1136
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:21.208
Ramona and I never really wanted kids.

1137
01:22:21.208 --> 01:22:24.666
Just always thought we'd travel.
see the world.

1138
01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:29.458
But life had other plans for us.

1139
01:22:29.458 --> 01:22:32.958
After Evelyn died.
Randy sort of fell apart. I guess.

1140
01:22:33.541 --> 01:22:34.750
Took to drinking.

1141
01:22:36.291 --> 01:22:40.958
Then one day. he showed up
at our house with little June.

1142
01:22:41.666 --> 01:22:44.583
said he had an appointment.
needed us to watch her.

1143
01:22:45.250 --> 01:22:46.750
but he never came back.

1144
01:22:47.333 --> 01:22:50.333
Just left that poor little girl with us.
She was four.

1145
01:22:50.333 --> 01:22:53.583
Nobody ever heard from
or saw that man again.

1146
01:22:53.583 --> 01:22:56.791
Maybe something happened.
like an accident or--

1147
01:22:56.791 --> 01:23:00.833
Police found his car
for sale at a used lot.

1148
01:23:00.833 --> 01:23:04.750
uh. his watch at a pawn shop.

1149
01:23:05.333 --> 01:23:06.875
He took my shirt.

1150
01:23:07.458 --> 01:23:09.375
my driver's license.

1151
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.541
Might have used that
to change his identity.

1152
01:23:14.916 --> 01:23:16.291
What do you think happened?

1153
01:23:16.291 --> 01:23:19.583
My guess. uh. drank himself to death.

1154
01:23:20.166 --> 01:23:21.541
Suicide. maybe. Who knows?

1155
01:23:21.541 --> 01:23:25.333
It's... it's hard to feel much sympathy
for somebody like that.

1156
01:23:25.333 --> 01:23:28.375
abandoning their own motherless child.

1157
01:23:28.375 --> 01:23:30.458
I can't think of a greater sin than that.

1158
01:23:30.458 --> 01:23:31.458
No.

1159
01:23:32.541 --> 01:23:34.833
No. No. no. No way.
He wouldn't do something like that.

1160
01:23:34.833 --> 01:23:37.791
You said it yourself.
He can't remember. right?

1161
01:23:39.291 --> 01:23:44.208
Maybe the reason he can't remember.
because the truth. what he did.

1162
01:23:45.083 --> 01:23:46.416
is too unbearable.

1163
01:23:56.083 --> 01:23:58.250
Randy? That's you. isn't it?

1164
01:24:08.916 --> 01:24:10.083
Oh my God.

1165
01:24:18.458 --> 01:24:20.583
Get away from me! Get away from me!

1166
01:24:24.250 --> 01:24:25.875
Ernest! Get out of here!

1167
01:24:30.166 --> 01:24:31.875
Get off me!

1168
01:24:32.458 --> 01:24:34.000
- Get off me!

1169
01:24:41.791 --> 01:24:42.708
Go to thermal!

1170
01:24:45.625 --> 01:24:46.541
Light him up!

1171
01:24:51.875 --> 01:24:53.958
Ernest! Stop!

1172
01:24:55.333 --> 01:24:56.500
Stop!

1173
01:24:57.083 --> 01:24:59.083
- Stop. you're hurting him!

1174
01:25:00.541 --> 01:25:01.750
Ernest!

1175
01:25:04.666 --> 01:25:07.125
Get your hands up! Hands up now!

1176
01:25:07.125 --> 01:25:08.125
Get 'em up!

1177
01:25:08.125 --> 01:25:09.125
Ernest. no!

1178
01:25:11.708 --> 01:25:13.125
- On your feet. now!
- No.

1179
01:25:24.333 --> 01:25:25.458
They have him.

1180
01:25:26.333 --> 01:25:27.666
Where are you taking him?

1181
01:25:29.291 --> 01:25:30.291
Ernest!

1182
01:25:43.291 --> 01:25:44.291
Kevin.

1183
01:25:47.958 --> 01:25:48.875
Are you okay?

1184
01:25:48.875 --> 01:25:50.875
- Yeah. I'm fine.
<i>-</i> Did they hurt you?

1185
01:25:50.875 --> 01:25:51.958
-  No.
- Are you sure?

1186
01:25:52.583 --> 01:25:54.000
- Yeah.
- Let's get you home.

1187
01:26:07.083 --> 01:26:09.041
I guess this worked out for you. huh?

1188
01:26:09.041 --> 01:26:13.375
I think. considering the situation.
it's a pretty fair exchange. don't you?

1189
01:26:14.916 --> 01:26:17.291
Now you and your family
can go live a normal life.

1190
01:26:30.875 --> 01:26:32.333
- Hey.

1191
01:26:36.625 --> 01:26:37.583
Sorry about your car.

1192
01:26:38.625 --> 01:26:39.458
It's just a car.

1193
01:26:40.958 --> 01:26:42.166
You good though?

1194
01:26:45.625 --> 01:26:46.500
Yeah.

1195
01:27:24.916 --> 01:27:28.625
I've been
waiting for this moment

1196
01:27:30.083 --> 01:27:31.291
for so long.

1197
01:27:58.500 --> 01:27:59.458
No. no. no.

1198
01:28:00.625 --> 01:28:01.833
Stand down. I'm good.

1199
01:28:07.916 --> 01:28:11.166
Come on. just right this way.
Ah. there she is.

1200
01:28:11.958 --> 01:28:14.625
Ah. the woman of the hour.

1201
01:28:15.291 --> 01:28:17.541
Gentlemen... Oh. and lady.

1202
01:28:17.541 --> 01:28:20.666
please meet Dr. Leslie Monroe.

1203
01:28:20.666 --> 01:28:23.583
Oh. actually. I correct myself.

1204
01:28:23.583 --> 01:28:24.791
Agent Monroe.

1205
01:28:24.791 --> 01:28:29.666
She assisted us in capturing
the asset you see before you.

1206
01:28:29.666 --> 01:28:31.125
- Very good job. yes.

1207
01:28:31.125 --> 01:28:32.083
Bravo.

1208
01:28:32.083 --> 01:28:34.708
So. now--
No. please. please. just take a look.

1209
01:28:41.708 --> 01:28:44.083
Of course you did more than just assist.
That was just--

1210
01:28:44.083 --> 01:28:45.041
What's the endgame?

1211
01:28:46.416 --> 01:28:48.583
-  I'm sorry. endgame?
-  Well...

1212
01:28:51.208 --> 01:28:52.625
What are you gonna do with him?

1213
01:28:52.625 --> 01:28:55.833
Well. he's dead. so. uh...

1214
01:28:57.375 --> 01:28:58.708
whatever the hell we want.

1215
01:29:27.833 --> 01:29:30.583
Hi. um. is Kevin around?

1216
01:29:31.791 --> 01:29:33.125
I haven't seen him at school.

1217
01:29:33.125 --> 01:29:36.250
Uh. yeah. he's just taking
a little break from stuff. honey.

1218
01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:38.208
Maybe come back another time?

1219
01:29:38.208 --> 01:29:39.666
Yeah. okay.

1220
01:29:39.666 --> 01:29:40.916
It's okay. Mom.

1221
01:29:44.083 --> 01:29:45.083
Hey.

1222
01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:47.875
You haven't responded to any of my texts.

1223
01:29:48.458 --> 01:29:49.541
Yeah. I...

1224
01:29:50.541 --> 01:29:54.916
I haven't really felt like
talking to anyone. so...

1225
01:29:54.916 --> 01:29:56.833
It's okay. I get it.

1226
01:30:00.833 --> 01:30:01.666
How is everything?

1227
01:30:02.291 --> 01:30:06.083
Well. I'm grounded until I'm 80.
but other than that. super peachy.

1228
01:30:08.958 --> 01:30:12.083
Um. I just... I wanted to check up on you.

1229
01:30:15.041 --> 01:30:15.958
Cool.

1230
01:30:17.458 --> 01:30:18.625
Thanks.

1231
01:30:18.625 --> 01:30:20.333
No. really though. Are you doing okay?

1232
01:30:23.166 --> 01:30:24.000
Yeah.

1233
01:30:25.916 --> 01:30:26.791
I'm fine.

1234
01:30:29.416 --> 01:30:30.458
See you around.

1235
01:30:53.166 --> 01:30:54.041
Hey.

1236
01:31:01.625 --> 01:31:03.250
It's so quiet up here now.

1237
01:31:09.625 --> 01:31:11.208
Feels strange.

1238
01:31:18.250 --> 01:31:20.583
It was raining like this
the day you were born.

1239
01:31:21.375 --> 01:31:24.583
I remember because
I was driving your mom to the hospital.

1240
01:31:25.875 --> 01:31:27.666
and traffic was so bad.

1241
01:31:29.208 --> 01:31:31.458
I thought she was gonna
give birth right there in the car.

1242
01:31:32.041 --> 01:31:33.125
I was petrified.

1243
01:31:33.125 --> 01:31:37.041
I made a promise to myself
that if we made it to the hospital...

1244
01:31:40.666 --> 01:31:42.416
I was gonna be the best dad in the world.

1245
01:31:46.625 --> 01:31:47.791
It's funny.

1246
01:31:50.625 --> 01:31:51.958
When your kids are little.

1247
01:31:53.250 --> 01:31:54.541
it's easy to be a parent.

1248
01:31:56.041 --> 01:31:59.666
They don't see who you actually are.

1249
01:32:01.583 --> 01:32:03.041
They just see the good stuff.

1250
01:32:04.208 --> 01:32:05.541
What you want them to see.

1251
01:32:07.625 --> 01:32:10.041
But eventually. as they grow up...

1252
01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:16.625
parts of yourself that you don't like
become harder and harder to hide.

1253
01:32:19.416 --> 01:32:20.375
I guess

1254
01:32:21.583 --> 01:32:24.541
I never really figured out who I am.

1255
01:32:27.833 --> 01:32:29.750
I've just always chased stuff.

1256
01:32:30.416 --> 01:32:32.250
New places. new jobs...

1257
01:32:34.458 --> 01:32:36.125
hoping something would click.

1258
01:32:37.333 --> 01:32:43.041
and I would finally be the man
I wanted to be for you and Fulton...

1259
01:32:45.833 --> 01:32:47.041
and your mom.

1260
01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.333
But then Ernest came. and I was like.

1261
01:32:50.875 --> 01:32:52.208
"This is it."

1262
01:32:55.625 --> 01:32:56.750
I could finally...

1263
01:32:59.375 --> 01:33:01.333
have a purpose.

1264
01:33:02.916 --> 01:33:04.458
I could finally be worthy.

1265
01:33:10.708 --> 01:33:12.333
I lost myself all over again.

1266
01:33:16.083 --> 01:33:17.291
I let you down. kid.

1267
01:33:22.708 --> 01:33:24.166
I broke my promise.

1268
01:33:38.166 --> 01:33:39.666
I know you're upset about Ernest.

1269
01:33:41.125 --> 01:33:44.750
But you tried to do the right thing.
and that's all that matters.

1270
01:33:48.208 --> 01:33:51.583
You're a better man at 16

1271
01:33:52.291 --> 01:33:53.958
than I am at 45.

1272
01:33:57.041 --> 01:33:58.416
I admire you. Kevin.

1273
01:34:01.166 --> 01:34:03.416
You turned out great. in spite of me.

1274
01:34:44.583 --> 01:34:47.208
Can you face me. please? Turn towards me.

1275
01:34:51.041 --> 01:34:52.000
Turn around.

1276
01:34:56.250 --> 01:34:57.375
Turn around.

1277
01:35:00.750 --> 01:35:02.458
I said turn around.

1278
01:35:06.083 --> 01:35:07.083
Comply.

1279
01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Comply.

1280
01:35:17.708 --> 01:35:20.000
I said comply!

1281
01:35:22.541 --> 01:35:23.750
<i>Comply!</i>

1282
01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:36.750
Comply!

1283
01:36:45.666 --> 01:36:47.625
Yeah. Works on the living too.

1284
01:36:54.291 --> 01:36:55.291
Thank you.

1285
01:36:56.083 --> 01:36:56.916
Get out of here.

1286
01:37:03.250 --> 01:37:05.125
- ...figured it out.
- Where is our Uber?

1287
01:37:05.125 --> 01:37:06.541
It's a Lyft. stupid.

1288
01:37:06.541 --> 01:37:08.458
- You're stupid. Tara.
- Oh my God!

1289
01:37:08.458 --> 01:37:10.916
- We're gonna get mugged and die out here.
- No. no.

1290
01:37:10.916 --> 01:37:13.375
- It's gonna be fine.
- We should go to Taco Bell!

1291
01:37:13.375 --> 01:37:15.000
- Yes!

1292
01:37:15.666 --> 01:37:18.083
- Wait. is that it? Oh my God!
- Oh my God! Thank you!

1293
01:37:18.083 --> 01:37:19.333
Hi. hi. hi.

1294
01:37:19.333 --> 01:37:21.375
- Is this for Gabby?
- Uh-huh.

1295
01:37:28.041 --> 01:37:29.875
Holy shit. man!

1296
01:37:30.625 --> 01:37:32.791
Ernest. dude!

1297
01:37:32.791 --> 01:37:35.208
Uh. excuse me. This is my Uber.

1298
01:37:35.208 --> 01:37:37.583
Uh. it's a Lyft. bitch.

1299
01:37:37.583 --> 01:37:38.958
Bye!

1300
01:37:39.458 --> 01:37:40.375
Wait!

1301
01:37:41.083 --> 01:37:42.833
Hell yeah!

1302
01:37:42.833 --> 01:37:44.875
- So. which way you headed. Ernest?

1303
01:37:48.458 --> 01:37:49.708
You got it.

1304
01:38:07.708 --> 01:38:08.541
Ernest?

1305
01:38:59.875 --> 01:39:02.708
-  I missed this house.

1306
01:39:07.125 --> 01:39:09.541
Randy. a ghost.

1307
01:39:09.541 --> 01:39:12.083
A goddamn ghost.

1308
01:39:17.041 --> 01:39:21.625
Fifty years... I've kept this secret.

1309
01:39:23.625 --> 01:39:26.791
But the chickens
finally came home to roost.

1310
01:39:26.791 --> 01:39:28.625
I don't know anything. I swear.

1311
01:39:28.625 --> 01:39:30.833
You're lying. You came after me.

1312
01:39:30.833 --> 01:39:33.625
- I was just trying to help him.
- You're lying!

1313
01:39:35.166 --> 01:39:38.166
- Frank. Did you hear that?
- Okay. All right. Yup. yup. yup.

1314
01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:47.416
Stay here.

1315
01:39:48.333 --> 01:39:49.750
- Be careful.
- All right.

1316
01:40:12.458 --> 01:40:14.500
- What are you doing?
- Thought I heard something!

1317
01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:16.750
Shit.

1318
01:40:16.750 --> 01:40:17.666
Me too.

1319
01:40:18.750 --> 01:40:19.583
Stay here.

1320
01:40:19.583 --> 01:40:20.541
Yeah. right.

1321
01:40:22.625 --> 01:40:23.541
Come on.

1322
01:40:54.666 --> 01:40:55.666
Drop it.

1323
01:40:56.500 --> 01:40:58.041
Okay. Okay. take it easy.

1324
01:41:04.250 --> 01:41:05.875
Please don't hurt my son.

1325
01:41:06.458 --> 01:41:08.333
It was Ramona's idea.

1326
01:41:08.875 --> 01:41:13.041
She couldn't have kids of her own.
and when her sister died.

1327
01:41:13.041 --> 01:41:15.583
she said it was a sign from God

1328
01:41:16.166 --> 01:41:19.958
that Randy couldn't take care of June
without her mother.

1329
01:41:19.958 --> 01:41:23.666
She made me do it.
I didn't want to. She made me.

1330
01:41:23.666 --> 01:41:25.791
We can talk about this.
Just put the gun down.

1331
01:41:25.791 --> 01:41:27.458
- Don't!
- Okay. okay.

1332
01:41:27.458 --> 01:41:29.208
Frank. what's happening?

1333
01:41:31.083 --> 01:41:32.750
Get him out of here!

1334
01:41:33.833 --> 01:41:35.041
- Dad!
- Let's go!

1335
01:41:35.041 --> 01:41:36.291
- Dad!
-  Come on!

1336
01:41:52.166 --> 01:41:53.458
Get away from them!

1337
01:42:02.125 --> 01:42:03.166
Go to Mom!

1338
01:42:13.791 --> 01:42:15.208
- Come on!
- Stop it!

1339
01:42:15.208 --> 01:42:16.708
- Kevin. no!
-  Get in!

1340
01:42:16.708 --> 01:42:18.416
Kevin. no! Kevin!

1341
01:42:26.875 --> 01:42:28.625
Kevin! No! Please!

1342
01:42:28.625 --> 01:42:30.583
Stay inside! Call the cops!

1343
01:44:02.541 --> 01:44:04.000
Little Junebug.

1344
01:44:04.958 --> 01:44:07.250
She made Ramona so happy.

1345
01:44:07.250 --> 01:44:10.583
That's all she really wanted
was her own little girl.

1346
01:44:10.583 --> 01:44:12.791
She doesn't talk to us anymore.

1347
01:44:12.791 --> 01:44:16.125
Maybe deep down she knows...

1348
01:44:46.833 --> 01:44:48.625
What?

1349
01:44:57.666 --> 01:44:59.250
I killed you!

1350
01:45:21.208 --> 01:45:22.375
I knew you'd come back.

1351
01:45:25.583 --> 01:45:26.500
Kevin!

1352
01:45:34.500 --> 01:45:36.333
- Dad. no!

1353
01:45:53.625 --> 01:45:54.500
Kevin.

1354
01:45:54.500 --> 01:45:55.708
Dad.

1355
01:45:55.708 --> 01:45:57.416
Okay. I got you. You okay?

1356
01:45:57.416 --> 01:45:58.583
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1357
01:46:00.458 --> 01:46:01.541
Ernest.

1358
01:46:03.208 --> 01:46:05.541
Frank! Kevin! Oh. thank God!

1359
01:46:06.041 --> 01:46:07.125
Thank God.

1360
01:46:24.916 --> 01:46:26.083
And that was it?

1361
01:46:27.291 --> 01:46:32.750
This ghost that was haunting your house
for. what. 50 years. just suddenly...

1362
01:46:34.791 --> 01:46:35.708
he's gone?

1363
01:46:37.583 --> 01:46:38.875
It was dark.

1364
01:46:39.875 --> 01:46:42.708
It was raining. It was hard to see. but...

1365
01:46:44.583 --> 01:46:46.458
I... I looked around. and he wasn't there.

1366
01:46:48.583 --> 01:46:50.666
Why... why would he just vanish like that?

1367
01:46:51.333 --> 01:46:52.166
I don't know.

1368
01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:55.166
Maybe he didn't need to be here anymore.

1369
01:46:57.333 --> 01:46:58.750
Found the guy who killed him

1370
01:47:00.333 --> 01:47:01.375
and got closure.

1371
01:47:12.208 --> 01:47:13.708
What really happened. Kevin?

1372
01:49:34.458 --> 01:49:35.500
Hi. Daddy.

1373
01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:09.625
Oh. nice.

1374
01:50:10.166 --> 01:50:11.583
Okay. let me try. Let's see.

1375
01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:18.583
I suck. Okay.

1376
01:52:13.625 --> 01:52:14.625
Bye. Ernest.

1377
01:52:20.750 --> 01:52:21.625
Kevin.

1378
01:52:23.750 --> 01:52:27.541
Tell me what happened.

1379
01:52:45.708 --> 01:52:47.166
<i>Hey. sorry I can't be there.</i>

1380
01:52:47.166 --> 01:52:49.333
Oh yeah. I'm sure you're just devastated.

1381
01:52:49.333 --> 01:52:51.333
- Why aren't you studying. boy?

1382
01:52:51.333 --> 01:52:53.250
<i>Dad. come on. It's a Saturday. Please.</i>

1383
01:52:53.250 --> 01:52:54.875
Yeah. and what the hell is a Saturday?

1384
01:52:54.875 --> 01:52:56.000
- Go study.
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>

1385
01:52:59.041 --> 01:53:02.375
But I feel bad for whoever has
to deal with this shitty attic.

1386
01:53:06.208 --> 01:53:09.833
You know. I don't really think I'm down
with you not being my neighbor anymore.

1387
01:53:09.833 --> 01:53:12.541
Well. I'm only like five miles away.

1388
01:53:12.541 --> 01:53:14.750
- Plus. I get my car soon.

1389
01:53:14.750 --> 01:53:16.458
Okay. Smell you. bitch.

1390
01:53:16.458 --> 01:53:19.375
I know. Ka-ching!
Haunted houses are a thing now.

1391
01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:26.583
Figured I'd find you two up here.

1392
01:53:26.583 --> 01:53:27.875
- Dad.

1393
01:53:27.875 --> 01:53:30.000
Hey. the truck is loaded.
It's time to say goodbye.

1394
01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:33.625
Uh. last chance for y'all
to do whatever y'all were doing

1395
01:53:33.625 --> 01:53:35.041
or gonna do before you did.

1396
01:53:35.041 --> 01:53:36.166
- Stop it.
