to make me smile *

- There's something
magical about it.

12
00:00:36.637 --> 00:00:37.971
It's transcendent.

26
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.478
- "American Pie" is an epic.

27
00:01:17.545 --> 00:01:19.647
It's "War and Peace."
It's the big novel.

28

- * If the Bible
tells you so? *

29
00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:25.753

of America and our culture.

in rock 'n' roll? *

31
00:01:28.456 --> 00:01:29.590

32
00:01:29.657 --> 00:01:31.159
I could go deliver the paper.

33
00:01:31.225 --> 00:01:33.694

there was this story.

killed in a plane crash.

35

state of psychic shock.

41
00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:54.448
And so. I said. "I got to have
a big song about America."

One day. it all came out
like a genie out of a bottle.

it's iconic.

- * This'll be the day

54
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.013
- "American Pie" was
really encapsulating

55
00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.382
the experience
of a whole generation.

56
00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:31.051

we've been on our own *

57

- Everybody can relate
to that song.

"American Pie" drew you in
deeply.

59

- * But that's not
how it used to be *

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.462

a kaleidoscopic.

about America.

62
00:02:44.432 --> 00:02:47.635
* The jester stole
his thorny crown *

63
00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:51.472
I say "the jester stole
his thorny crown."

64
00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:53.441
Elvis did not have
a thorny crown.

65
00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:57.678
"A pink carnation." sure.
I went to a lot of proms.

66
00:02:57.745 --> 00:02:59.513
but I never had
a pickup truck.

67
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.649
But I could have anything
I wanted in my songs.

68
00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:04.652
* I saw Satan laughing
with delight *

69
00:03:04.718 --> 00:03:06.620
- It's the kind of song
you dream about writing

70
00:03:06.687 --> 00:03:09.089
that has meaning
and has depth.

71
00:03:09.156 --> 00:03:11.792

74
00:03:17.164 --> 00:03:20.033
Meanwhile.
an eight-minute song is still

all over the world.

76

- * Singin'. "This'll
be the day that I die" *

77
00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:26.807
It is a masterpiece.

78
00:03:26.874 --> 00:03:28.909
- No one's ever written
anything like it since.

79
00:03:28.976 --> 00:03:30.611
- There's a reason it's
been around for 50 years.

We believed in the church.

93
00:04:16.557 --> 00:04:19.327
We believed in our government.

94
00:04:19.393 --> 00:04:21.228
I was ill quite a bit.

95
00:04:21.295 --> 00:04:24.732
I had asthma and I would
be out of school

96
00:04:24.798 --> 00:04:26.300
for weeks and weeks.

97
00:04:26.367 --> 00:04:29.903

at kids playing outside.

My father's idea
of what he wanted for his son

101
00:04:40.047 --> 00:04:44.452
was a West Point guy.

upright American boy.

103
00:04:47.955 --> 00:04:49.790
And I thought.
"I can't be farther apart

104
00:04:49.857 --> 00:04:51.592
from this guy than I am."

105
00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:54.495
- * Well. now.

* And you've got
a tale to tell *

* Well. just take a walk *

108
00:04:58.566 --> 00:05:00.501
- And that's when I first
heard Elvis Presley.

109
00:05:00.568 --> 00:05:02.370
- * Heartbreak Hotel *

110
00:05:02.436 --> 00:05:06.239
- "Heartbreak Hotel."

* You'll be so lonely.

113
00:05:11.912 --> 00:05:13.781
- It just seemed to me that

114
00:05:13.847 --> 00:05:16.917
that image was
a very romantic image.

115
00:05:16.984 --> 00:05:19.119
I've always been
in love with romance.

116
00:05:19.186 --> 00:05:21.021

whether it was Robin Hood

117
00:05:21.088 --> 00:05:23.491
or Superman
or the Lone Ranger.

118
00:05:23.557 --> 00:05:26.494
and I started thinking
I could morph myself

119
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.063
into this somehow. maybe
if I could play the guitar.

120
00:05:32.132 --> 00:05:34.668
I've never talked about this
in the song all these years.

121
00:05:34.735 --> 00:05:36.904
but I talk
about "the sacred store."

122
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.272
and the sacred store
is the House of Music

123
00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:41.341
on Main Street
in New Rochelle.

124
00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:43.210
and that's where I bought
my records.

125
00:05:43.276 --> 00:05:46.213
and that's where I bought
my first guitar.

126
00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:48.516
And I started to learn.
I learned three chords.

127
00:05:48.582 --> 00:05:51.485
and I was off to the races.
but I drove everybody crazy.

128
00:05:51.552 --> 00:05:53.887
I'd play records over
and over and over.

129
00:05:53.954 --> 00:05:56.289
Bo Diddley and Gene Vincent.

130
00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:57.625

131
00:05:57.691 --> 00:06:00.160

He had a rollicking sound.

135
00:06:07.267 --> 00:06:10.571
He was always full
of joy and exuberance.

with jingling
and jangling guitars.

139
00:06:19.747 --> 00:06:21.849
And his songs were great.

140
00:06:23.417 --> 00:06:26.053
There was something else
about Buddy Holly

141
00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:27.988
that he is only 21 or 22.

142
00:06:28.055 --> 00:06:30.724
He had a certain genius.

143
00:06:32.893 --> 00:06:34.562
He was a serious guy.
you know.

144
00:06:34.628 --> 00:06:36.396
Country people were serious.

145
00:06:36.464 --> 00:06:37.831
You know.
they've been through a lot.

146
00:06:37.898 --> 00:06:39.567

are cotton fields.

149
00:06:45.072 --> 00:06:48.008
Holly Tile was the company
that the father had.

150
00:06:48.075 --> 00:06:50.110
Buddy would have been
laying tile floors

151
00:06:50.177 --> 00:06:54.114
in bathrooms
or picking cotton.

152
00:06:54.181 --> 00:06:56.183

Lubbock. Texas?

153
00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:58.051
- Lubbock. Texas. yes.
- Right after high school.

154
00:06:58.118 --> 00:06:59.753
you started playing together?

155
00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.121
- Yes. sir. that's right.
- You were a big hit right

156
00:07:01.188 --> 00:07:03.557
from the start or has it
been sort of a long...

157
00:07:03.624 --> 00:07:06.860
- Well. we've had a few
rough times. I guess you'd say.

158
00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:08.862
but we've been real lucky
getting it this quick.

159
00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:11.899
- He had made recordings
in Nashville.

160
00:07:11.965 --> 00:07:14.067
which were not successful.

161
00:07:14.134 --> 00:07:17.304
And then he went
to Clovis. Mew Mexico.

162
00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.007
to Norman Petty's studio

163
00:07:20.073 --> 00:07:21.709
and recorded many of
the same songs.

164
00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:23.143
including
"That'll Be The Day."

165
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.278
and suddenly he had
a number one record.

166
00:07:29.382 --> 00:07:32.052
Norman Petty was
the difference.

167
00:07:32.119 --> 00:07:35.889
He knew what to do
to commercialize Buddy Holly.

168
00:07:41.929 --> 00:07:43.831
There was a--an alchemy.

169
00:07:43.897 --> 00:07:45.499
He made magic.

170
00:07:52.405 --> 00:07:54.675
And knowing it was not
only all over the country.

171
00:07:54.742 --> 00:07:56.844

176
00:08:16.096 --> 00:08:17.931
back in the 1920s.

177
00:08:17.998 --> 00:08:19.933
This is my son. and now Andrew

178
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.501
and his cousin
are involved in it.

179
00:08:23.571 --> 00:08:26.173
- This field has been
in our family for generations.

180
00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:27.975
and it's really important
to us

181
00:08:28.041 --> 00:08:29.543
because it's our livelihood.

182
00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.445
but also there's no other field
in the countryside

183
00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:34.347
that's got more history
than this field.

184
00:08:36.283 --> 00:08:39.352
- This is a place
where one of the first

185
00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:41.789
big rock 'n' roll
tragedies occurred.

186
00:08:44.758 --> 00:08:46.259
It's very simple.

187
00:08:46.326 --> 00:08:47.995
it's in the middle
of a cornfield.

188
00:08:48.061 --> 00:08:51.231
it's not fancy.
no flashing lights.

189
00:08:51.298 --> 00:08:55.769
* *

190
00:08:55.836 --> 00:08:58.005
This is where the music died.

191
00:09:00.908 --> 00:09:03.677
This is where the music died.

192
00:09:03.744 --> 00:09:07.014
- * I can't remember
if I cried *

193
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.584
* When I read
about his widowed bride *

194
00:09:10.651 --> 00:09:15.122
- In 1971. I was just
beginning to explore music.

195
00:09:15.188 --> 00:09:17.524
and "American Pie" was one
of those songs.

196
00:09:17.591 --> 00:09:21.094
I listened to it
over and over again.

197
00:09:21.161 --> 00:09:23.296
I had no idea
that it had anything

198
00:09:23.363 --> 00:09:26.533
to do about Clear Lake
or the farm that we owned.

199
00:09:29.236 --> 00:09:30.804
- This story in
from Clear Lake. Iowa.

200
00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:32.873
three of the nation's top
rock 'n' roll singing stars.

201
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.275
Ritchie Valens. J.P.
"The Big Bopper" Richardson.

202
00:09:35.342 --> 00:09:37.210
and Buddy Holly died today
with their pilot

203
00:09:37.277 --> 00:09:39.246
in the crash
of a chartered plane.

204
00:09:40.948 --> 00:09:46.086
- In 1979. when a local DJ
named the Mad Hatter started

205
00:09:46.153 --> 00:09:48.555
the first Buddy Holly tribute.

206
00:09:48.622 --> 00:09:50.691
and then this gentleman.
Ken Paquette.

207
00:09:50.758 --> 00:09:52.459
did the research and said.

208
00:09:52.525 --> 00:09:55.495
"Okay. this is where
the plane crashed."

209
00:09:55.562 --> 00:09:58.498
[country music]

210
00:09:58.565 --> 00:09:59.767
* *

211
00:09:59.833 --> 00:10:01.601
He put a monument out there.

212
00:10:01.669 --> 00:10:03.804
and people started coming
searching for the place.

213
00:10:03.871 --> 00:10:06.940
so I had our welder make
an extra big set of glasses.

214
00:10:07.007 --> 00:10:08.541
and I mounted 'em out there.

215
00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:10.243
and of course. that's kind of
turned into a little bit

216
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:12.245
of a monument in itself.

217
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:17.718
When Don's song came out.
it just lit up the enthusiasm

218
00:10:17.785 --> 00:10:20.453
and the interest in Buddy
and in that story.

219
00:10:22.489 --> 00:10:23.957
Buddy and Ritchie
and The Bopper.

220
00:10:24.024 --> 00:10:25.693
the guys were so young.

221
00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:27.127
Ritchie was only 17.

222
00:10:27.194 --> 00:10:28.561
That fateful night.

223
00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:30.898
they entertained
a couple thousand fans.

224
00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:32.900
It all ended out here.

225
00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:34.802
Now this is a pilgrimage.

226
00:10:34.868 --> 00:10:37.237
People from all over
the world travel here.

227
00:10:37.304 --> 00:10:39.306
We'll occasionally have
a hayride out here.

228
00:10:39.372 --> 00:10:41.008
and we'll sing "American Pie."

229
00:10:41.074 --> 00:10:43.143
Everybody knows that song.

230
00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:47.147
That is the song of our lives.

231
00:10:47.214 --> 00:10:50.818
- * A long. long time ago *

232
00:10:50.884 --> 00:10:55.088
* I can still remember
how that music *

233
00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:59.760
* Used to make me smile *

234
00:10:59.827 --> 00:11:02.896
- "American Pie.
it's woven into the fabric

235
00:11:02.963 --> 00:11:05.332
of America and our culture.

236
00:11:05.398 --> 00:11:08.501
- * That I could make
those people dance *

237
00:11:08.568 --> 00:11:11.671
- It just sort of feels
like it's always existed.

238
00:11:11.739 --> 00:11:14.407
It's just ubiquitous
and predates

239
00:11:14.474 --> 00:11:15.843
time itself or something.

240
00:11:15.909 --> 00:11:20.680
- * The day the music *

241
00:11:20.748 --> 00:11:24.117
- I'm told we're the world's
first all-vocal country band.

242
00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:28.388
all: * Bye-bye.
Miss American Pie *

243
00:11:28.455 --> 00:11:31.024
- "American Pie."
it's one of those songs

244
00:11:31.091 --> 00:11:33.493
that I have known as long
as I can remember.

245
00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.796
- I've been singing that song
my whole life.

246
00:11:35.863 --> 00:11:39.199
- I remember my mother singing
that song to me. just as a song

247
00:11:39.266 --> 00:11:40.834
that never leaves you.
it's just always there.

248
00:11:40.901 --> 00:11:44.571
- By the time I remember
hearing that song on the radio.

249
00:11:44.637 --> 00:11:46.706
I feel like I already knew
all the words.

250
00:11:46.774 --> 00:11:49.242
* Did you write
the book of love? *

251
00:11:49.309 --> 00:11:52.746
* And do you have faith
in God above? *

252
00:11:52.813 --> 00:11:55.482
- When our manager mentioned
to us that Don was interested

253
00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:57.885
in doing a special edition
of the song

254
00:11:57.951 --> 00:12:00.453
for its 50th anniversary
and including us.

255
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.189
we didn't even have
to think about it.

256
00:12:02.255 --> 00:12:05.192
- * Can music save
your mortal soul? *

257
00:12:05.258 --> 00:12:08.996
- We certainly felt
a sense of responsibility.

258
00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:12.399
just being handed the reins

259
00:12:12.465 --> 00:12:14.868
to such an important.
iconic song.

260
00:12:14.935 --> 00:12:19.206
- * With a pink carnation
and a pickup truck *

261
00:12:19.272 --> 00:12:22.575
- Don put a lot of trust
in us. and so. luckily.

262
00:12:22.642 --> 00:12:25.779
he was thrilled
with what we came up with.

263
00:12:25.846 --> 00:12:29.216
He just added his vocal
to the mix and it was magic.

264
00:12:29.282 --> 00:12:32.419
all: * Bye-bye.
Miss American Pie *

265
00:12:32.485 --> 00:12:35.655
* Drove my Chevy to the levee.
but the levee was dry *

266
00:12:35.722 --> 00:12:38.391
- The day the music died
was such

267
00:12:38.458 --> 00:12:40.593
an earth-shattering moment.

268
00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.797
and then Don actually
put it into words.

269
00:12:43.864 --> 00:12:47.267
what everybody was feeling.
but wasn't really able to say.

270
00:12:47.334 --> 00:12:51.638
He used such incredible
imagery and metaphors

271
00:12:51.704 --> 00:12:54.641
that allowed the audience
to inject their own

272
00:12:54.707 --> 00:12:57.010
personal meaning
into the song as well.

273
00:12:57.077 --> 00:13:00.080
[dreamy music]

274
00:13:00.147 --> 00:13:02.582
* *

275
00:13:02.649 --> 00:13:06.887
There's a lot of things that
can unify us in strange ways.

276
00:13:06.954 --> 00:13:10.190
We're united in our grief
and sense of loss.

277
00:13:10.257 --> 00:13:11.658
That is what Don was able

278
00:13:11.724 --> 00:13:13.593
to articulate
through "American Pie."

279
00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.762
Just the imagery
of that chorus alone.

280
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:18.365
the idea of a bunch
of good old boys

281
00:13:18.431 --> 00:13:20.067
drinking whiskey
and rye and singing.

282
00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:21.501
"This'll be the day
that I die."

283
00:13:21.568 --> 00:13:24.237
It's a horrible thing
to be singing about.

284
00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:26.673
yet they're all singing
about it together.

285
00:13:26.739 --> 00:13:30.310
- * And the three men
I admire most *

286
00:13:30.377 --> 00:13:33.513
* The Father. Son.
and the Holy Ghost *

287
00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.282
- When he wrote it.
we were kind of

288
00:13:35.348 --> 00:13:38.418
on the tail end
of the two-minute pop song.

289
00:13:38.485 --> 00:13:41.488
Meanwhile. he comes out
with this eight-minute song

290
00:13:41.554 --> 00:13:44.524
that gets played on the radio.
and that's unheard of.

291
00:13:44.591 --> 00:13:50.430
- * Bye-bye.
Miss American Pie *

292
00:13:50.497 --> 00:13:52.432
- Now we're in the age
of TikTok

293
00:13:52.499 --> 00:13:53.901
where people don't want
to see anything

294
00:13:53.967 --> 00:13:55.135
longer than a few seconds.

295
00:13:55.202 --> 00:13:57.404
Meanwhile.
"American Pie" is still

296
00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:59.839
getting radio play
all over the world.

297
00:13:59.907 --> 00:14:04.111
- * Singing "This'll be
the day that I die" *

298
00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:05.745
- We were on tour in Europe.

299
00:14:05.812 --> 00:14:08.581
I was at some bar
at 1:00 in the morning.

300
00:14:08.648 --> 00:14:09.983
and then
"American Pie" came on.

301
00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:11.484
and everyone sang every word.

302
00:14:11.551 --> 00:14:13.153
and no one spoke any English.

303
00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:17.224
- * Bye-bye.
Miss American Pie *

304
00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:18.825
* Drove my Chevy to the levee *

305
00:14:18.892 --> 00:14:20.227
- There's something
magical about it.

306
00:14:20.293 --> 00:14:21.861
Everyone knows that song.

307
00:14:21.929 --> 00:14:25.232
Everyone on the planet can
sing a chorus of that song.

308
00:14:25.298 --> 00:14:26.666
It's transcendent.

309
00:14:26.733 --> 00:14:33.306
- * Singing "This'll be
the day that I die" *

310
00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:36.843
[cheers and applause]

311
00:14:38.145 --> 00:14:41.048
[cheerful music]

312
00:14:41.114 --> 00:14:42.549
* *

313
00:14:42.615 --> 00:14:44.551
- My father wanted me to work.

314
00:14:44.617 --> 00:14:46.186
so I thought
it was a cool idea.

315
00:14:46.253 --> 00:14:47.420
I could go deliver the paper.

316
00:14:47.487 --> 00:14:49.656
and that would be fun.

317
00:14:52.525 --> 00:14:57.597
I had a Sears Roebuck
fat tire bike.

318
00:14:57.664 --> 00:15:00.467
It had no gears or anything.

319
00:15:00.533 --> 00:15:02.970
It was like riding
a cast-iron lawnmower.

320
00:15:03.036 --> 00:15:04.804
is what it was like.

321
00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.776
I like the romance
of throwing the paper.

322
00:15:09.842 --> 00:15:12.512
and "Yes. I'm the paper boy.
that's right.

323
00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:14.214
I'll have your paper tomorrow.
don't worry."

324
00:15:14.281 --> 00:15:15.949
You know. this kind of thing.

325
00:15:18.451 --> 00:15:19.652
It was cold.

326
00:15:19.719 --> 00:15:22.155
February in those days
was cold.

327
00:15:22.222 --> 00:15:25.158
[echoing]
* February made me shiver *

328
00:15:25.225 --> 00:15:27.927
And you can see my house.

329
00:15:27.995 --> 00:15:31.498
there's kind of a stoop.
there's a cement block.

330
00:15:31.564 --> 00:15:34.867
and they would throw
the papers on that.

331
00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:36.536
and they'd be bound up.

332
00:15:36.603 --> 00:15:38.771
and so you'd cut it open

333
00:15:38.838 --> 00:15:41.908
and start putting
the papers in your sack.

334
00:15:47.147 --> 00:15:50.417
And one day I opened it up.
and there was this story.

335
00:15:50.483 --> 00:15:56.723
[echoing]
* Bad news on the doorstep *

336
00:15:56.789 --> 00:16:01.294
Three rock 'n' roll
stars killed in plane crash.

337
00:16:01.361 --> 00:16:04.197
and it was my guy
who was killed.

338
00:16:04.264 --> 00:16:06.566
Buddy was now dead.

339
00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:11.371
I was in absolute shock.

340
00:16:11.438 --> 00:16:13.273
Man. I read the whole story.

341
00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:18.778
I think I might have actually
cried. it was that personal.

342
00:16:18.845 --> 00:16:21.714
I felt like. you know.
you lost your first love.

343
00:16:21.781 --> 00:16:24.051
or you broke up
with your first girlfriend.

344
00:16:24.117 --> 00:16:26.753
You know. that dark.
horrible thing

345
00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:28.721
that comes over a teenager.
you know.

346
00:16:28.788 --> 00:16:30.290
and it's like the end

It hurt me.

It was kind of
a last minute tour

they weren't
in the air very long.

00:20:19.151 --> 00:20:20.820
- I could see the taillight
of the airplane.

and the aircraft.
in my opinion.

427
00:20:22.289 --> 00:20:25.124
was going down slowly.

428
00:20:25.191 --> 00:20:27.927

three miles northwest of us.

I said to the man
in the tower with me.

430
00:20:32.532 --> 00:20:35.101
who was a weatherman. that
the airplane was going down.

431
00:20:35.167 --> 00:20:37.337
and he said. "No.
that's an optical illusion."

432
00:20:37.404 --> 00:20:39.339
but I'd watched a lot
of airplanes.

correctly.

and just flew the plane
into the ground.

00:21:05.632 --> 00:21:07.400

than three or four minutes.
maybe four or five miles.

Their plane came down
at a very high rate

of the wings cut

They skidded about 500 feet
with the tail going up.

a little bit of a ridge

he radioed back
to the airport.

00:21:43.069 --> 00:21:44.737
and then they called
the Sheriff.

457
00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.909
that the people got out there
as quick as they could.

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:37.390

People are going to know
the last two or three.

520
00:24:49.522 --> 00:24:51.858
but all the ones up front.
they kind of sit through.

521
00:24:51.924 --> 00:24:53.225
I'm one of those
sit through guys.

522
00:24:53.292 --> 00:24:55.094
'cause we don't have
anything out yet.

523
00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:00.733
Right after the first song.
the big downbeat.

524
00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.769
something goes wrong.

525
00:25:02.835 --> 00:25:04.503
Everything is out.

526
00:25:04.571 --> 00:25:06.873
everything except my guitar
and my mic.

527
00:25:06.939 --> 00:25:08.340
And the first line
out of my mouth--

528
00:25:08.407 --> 00:25:10.109
I'll remember it
the rest of my life. was...

529
00:25:10.176 --> 00:25:13.946
* A long. long time ago *

530
00:25:14.013 --> 00:25:16.849
And you just watch
the whole place stop.

531
00:25:16.916 --> 00:25:20.753
The guy going up to get a beer
stopped. turns. and you see it.

532
00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:22.722
They came in.

533
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:24.223
They don't know
who this guy is.

534
00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:25.925
but he's singing
probably the greatest song

535
00:25:25.992 --> 00:25:27.226
in music history.

536
00:25:27.293 --> 00:25:28.527
and they're all singing
with you.

537
00:25:28.595 --> 00:25:32.031
And at that point.
not only did I have them.

538
00:25:32.098 --> 00:25:35.935
more importantly.
I knew they had me.

539
00:25:36.002 --> 00:25:38.805
But to take it on
to the next level

540
00:25:38.871 --> 00:25:40.873
and see it happen there too.

541
00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:43.175
it was just amazing.

542
00:25:43.242 --> 00:25:45.712
[eerie atmospheric music]

543
00:25:45.778 --> 00:25:48.114
* *

544
00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:53.452
- I had been doing
extremely poorly in school.

545
00:25:53.519 --> 00:25:57.456
I was a freshman
at Iona Preparatory School.

546
00:25:57.523 --> 00:26:00.526
Catholic. taught
by Irish Christian brothers.

547
00:26:00.593 --> 00:26:04.496
They looked like priests.
and it was very Dickensian.

548
00:26:06.065 --> 00:26:08.367
My mother had gone away.
and I'm waiting

549
00:26:08.434 --> 00:26:10.803
for this horrible
report card to come home.

550
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:12.739
My father's in a good mood.
You know. I think. "Oh. man.

551
00:26:12.805 --> 00:26:14.807
when this happens. he ain't
gonna be in a good mood."

552
00:26:14.874 --> 00:26:17.176
So the report card comes.

553
00:26:18.945 --> 00:26:21.247
My father.
he looked at this thing.

554
00:26:21.313 --> 00:26:23.182
and he said. "This is awful.

555
00:26:23.249 --> 00:26:25.251
"and you cannot go on
like this.

556
00:26:25.317 --> 00:26:27.253
and what is gonna
become of you?"

557
00:26:27.319 --> 00:26:29.521
Course. it wasn't low-key.
He was yelling. you know.

558
00:26:29.588 --> 00:26:31.290
'cause he had a temper.

559
00:26:31.357 --> 00:26:35.995
He felt all this silliness
with music was impinging on

560
00:26:36.062 --> 00:26:38.931
and diminishing my schoolwork.

561
00:26:38.998 --> 00:26:40.767
So I went to sleep.

562
00:26:40.833 --> 00:26:44.336
It's like 1:00 in the morning.
and all of a sudden.

563
00:26:44.403 --> 00:26:47.539
my father has his arms
around his chest.

564
00:26:47.606 --> 00:26:50.342
He comes in to me
and he's crying.

565
00:26:50.409 --> 00:26:53.379
He's saying. "God. help me."

566
00:26:53.445 --> 00:26:55.481
Ambulance came.
the police came.

567
00:26:55.547 --> 00:26:58.284
and they had him wrapped up
on a stretcher.

568
00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:00.052
They're bringing him
down the stairs.

569
00:27:00.119 --> 00:27:02.021
and he just looked up at me
and he smiled.

570
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:07.026
Two hours later. I'm sleeping.

571
00:27:07.093 --> 00:27:10.229
The door opens.
and my uncle is there.

572
00:27:10.296 --> 00:27:12.832
He said. "There's some
bad news for you. Donny."

573
00:27:12.899 --> 00:27:14.901
and he told me.

574
00:27:14.967 --> 00:27:17.103
"Your father died tonight."

575
00:27:17.169 --> 00:27:20.807
[somber music]

576
00:27:20.873 --> 00:27:22.975
I am ruined.

577
00:27:23.042 --> 00:27:25.177
I mean. I was really mad.

578
00:27:26.713 --> 00:27:30.382
That was very painful.
and it lasted a long time.

579
00:27:31.851 --> 00:27:36.022
It was almost like
the happy '50s were over.

580
00:27:38.157 --> 00:27:40.326
When my father died.
home left me.

581
00:27:40.392 --> 00:27:41.961
'cause it wasn't
there anymore.

582
00:27:42.028 --> 00:27:45.497
You can imagine how important
music became to me.

583
00:27:45.564 --> 00:27:48.000
creating something
out of myself.

584
00:27:48.067 --> 00:27:50.236
moving away from all this.

585
00:27:52.638 --> 00:27:57.409
Once I had the guitar going.
this folk thing started.

586
00:27:57.476 --> 00:28:02.081
I'd just write songs
and follow my instincts.

587
00:28:02.148 --> 00:28:04.450
And I started playing
around town.

588
00:28:04.516 --> 00:28:08.520
I would plan a concert
almost every month.

589
00:28:08.587 --> 00:28:12.925
It was now about 1964.
so I was about 18.

590
00:28:12.992 --> 00:28:14.560
and I had quit school

591
00:28:14.626 --> 00:28:16.128
'cause I wanted
to be a singer.

592
00:28:16.195 --> 00:28:20.767
- * John Henry.
when he was a baby *

593
00:28:20.833 --> 00:28:23.736
* Settin' down
on his mammy's knee *

594
00:28:23.803 --> 00:28:26.372
- But now I was learning songs

595
00:28:26.438 --> 00:28:28.808
that had substance
of some kind.

596
00:28:28.875 --> 00:28:31.510
They weren't little songs.
They were big songs.

597
00:28:31.577 --> 00:28:34.146
Woody Guthrie's
"Roll On. Columbia"

598
00:28:34.213 --> 00:28:36.515
was a big song
about the Columbia River

599
00:28:36.582 --> 00:28:38.751
and the men that built
the Grand Coulee Dam.

600
00:28:38.818 --> 00:28:41.153
- * There's a great
and peaceful river *

601
00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.155
* In a land
that's fair to see *

602
00:28:43.222 --> 00:28:45.091
- A song like
"Roll On. Columbia."

603
00:28:45.157 --> 00:28:46.625
you start about talking about

604
00:28:46.692 --> 00:28:48.995
our country took
the challenge.

605
00:28:49.061 --> 00:28:50.629
so you describe how it was.

606
00:28:50.696 --> 00:28:54.266
- * Roll. Columbia.
won't you roll. roll. roll *

607
00:28:54.333 --> 00:28:55.835
- And each time.
"Roll on. Columbia."

608
00:28:55.902 --> 00:28:57.970
- * Won't you roll.
roll. roll *

609
00:28:58.037 --> 00:29:00.739
- And then you're talking
about these mighty men labored

610
00:29:00.807 --> 00:29:03.342
by day and by night
to build this thing.

611
00:29:03.409 --> 00:29:07.046
- * Seldom you see
such a beautiful sight *

612
00:29:07.113 --> 00:29:08.948
- Third verse.
you're understanding

613
00:29:09.015 --> 00:29:10.516
what's happening.

614
00:29:10.582 --> 00:29:12.484
And by the fourth verse.
you hear that chorus.

615
00:29:12.551 --> 00:29:14.553
I mean. it all makes sense.

616
00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:15.922
That's the key.

617
00:29:15.988 --> 00:29:19.591
- * Roll on. Columbia.
roll on *

618
00:29:19.658 --> 00:29:23.896
* Roll on. Columbia.
roll on *

619
00:29:23.963 --> 00:29:28.100
* Your power is turning
our darkness to dawn *

620
00:29:28.167 --> 00:29:29.435
* So roll on *

621
00:29:29.501 --> 00:29:31.037
- "Tutti Frutti"
and "Don't Be Cruel"

622
00:29:31.103 --> 00:29:32.905
are fabulous small songs.

623
00:29:32.972 --> 00:29:35.374
and they changed the world
with those simple songs.

624
00:29:35.441 --> 00:29:38.010
but these songs were
more complicated

625
00:29:38.077 --> 00:29:40.479
and more interesting in terms
of what they're teaching you

626
00:29:40.546 --> 00:29:42.748
about your country
and about yourself.

627
00:29:42.815 --> 00:29:45.151
You know.
who are we as Americans?

628
00:29:45.217 --> 00:29:46.552
A guy like me thought.

629
00:29:46.618 --> 00:29:48.420
"Wow. gee. I could
write a song like that

630
00:29:48.487 --> 00:29:50.756
"with a little chorus
in between and a little story.

631
00:29:50.823 --> 00:29:53.059
and a little chorus.
and a little story."

632
00:29:53.125 --> 00:29:55.294
and that's
what "American Pie" does.

633
00:29:55.361 --> 00:29:58.630
- * Well. come on.
let's go. let's go *

634
00:29:58.697 --> 00:30:00.766
* Let's go. little darlin' *

635
00:30:00.833 --> 00:30:03.402
* And tell me that you'll
never leave me *

636
00:30:03.469 --> 00:30:05.171
- I'm Connie Valens.

637
00:30:05.237 --> 00:30:07.206
Ritchie Valens was my brother.

638
00:30:07.273 --> 00:30:08.875
- * Again. again. and again *

639
00:30:08.941 --> 00:30:10.676
* Well now. swing *

- The classic car show.
it's about the time.

641
00:30:13.179 --> 00:30:15.347
it's about the '50s.
just like my brother.

642
00:30:15.414 --> 00:30:17.249
You know. there's still
an innocence there.

643
00:30:17.316 --> 00:30:18.918
There's a purity.

644
00:30:18.985 --> 00:30:21.921

645
00:30:21.988 --> 00:30:23.322
* *

646
00:30:23.389 --> 00:30:26.258
We were born
in the San Fernando Valley.

647
00:30:26.325 --> 00:30:28.460
Ritchie. he was just
real warm.

648
00:30:28.527 --> 00:30:30.729
real loving. very protective.

649
00:30:33.099 --> 00:30:35.401
He discovered he was a pretty
good singer and guitar player.

650
00:30:35.467 --> 00:30:39.271
My mom used to say he could
make that guitar cry.

651
00:30:40.907 --> 00:30:43.742
The next thing you know.
he's touring.

652
00:30:43.809 --> 00:30:46.245
Everything was just
happening so fast.

653
00:30:46.312 --> 00:30:49.448
He was 17 with a big dream.

654
00:30:52.684 --> 00:30:55.554
My sister and I were
walking home from school.

655
00:30:55.621 --> 00:30:58.124
and somebody said.
"Your brother's dead."

656
00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:01.093
We just held hands and started
running towards our house.

657
00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.162
[somber music]

658
00:31:03.229 --> 00:31:06.032
Mama was sitting in the middle
of the living room.

659
00:31:06.098 --> 00:31:07.466
and she turned around
and looked at me.

660
00:31:07.533 --> 00:31:09.801
and she just looked so sad.

661
00:31:09.868 --> 00:31:12.972
and she just said

662
00:31:13.039 --> 00:31:15.507
that Ritchie had been killed.

663
00:31:15.574 --> 00:31:18.945
I remember just dropping
to my knees

664
00:31:19.011 --> 00:31:21.347
and putting my head in her lap.

665
00:31:21.413 --> 00:31:25.351
and she just
put her hand on my head.

666
00:31:26.652 --> 00:31:28.254
And that was the beginning

667
00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.189
of a very dark time
in our lives.

668
00:31:30.256 --> 00:31:37.363
* *

669
00:31:37.429 --> 00:31:41.067
The Surf is the cathedral
of rock 'n' roll.

670
00:31:41.133 --> 00:31:43.135
This is the last place he was.

671
00:31:43.202 --> 00:31:46.772
and a little part
of him will always be here.

672
00:31:46.838 --> 00:31:49.841
and every time I walk in.
I feel it.

673
00:31:53.145 --> 00:31:55.948
And sometimes I just
come up on the stage.

674
00:31:56.015 --> 00:31:57.849
and I stand where he stood.

675
00:31:59.418 --> 00:32:03.956
And it's like
he's still with us.

676
00:32:04.023 --> 00:32:06.058
He always will be.

677
00:32:06.125 --> 00:32:11.964
- * Oh. Donna. oh. Donna *

678
00:32:12.031 --> 00:32:14.700
- I first heard of Don McLean
and "American Pie"

679
00:32:14.766 --> 00:32:16.668
in the '70s
when it was released.

680
00:32:16.735 --> 00:32:20.672
- * Donna was her name *

681
00:32:20.739 --> 00:32:23.275
- I thought he did
a beautiful job.

682
00:32:23.342 --> 00:32:25.611
Obviously. he felt something

683
00:32:25.677 --> 00:32:28.247
very near and dear
in the tragedy.

684
00:32:28.314 --> 00:32:29.648
It was so heartfelt.

685
00:32:29.715 --> 00:32:33.019
and the lyrics
are just beautiful.

686
00:32:33.085 --> 00:32:34.553
I thought it was pretty cool

687
00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:37.256
that somebody would
care enough to do that.

688
00:32:37.323 --> 00:32:42.128
- * Oh. Donna. oh *

689
00:32:42.194 --> 00:32:44.430
- We were all very touched.

690
00:32:44.496 --> 00:32:47.366
It was another little bit
of healing for our family.

691
00:32:50.802 --> 00:32:53.972
- There was this inch-square
advertisement

692
00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.607
in the "New York Times."

693
00:32:55.674 --> 00:32:59.011
said. "Pete Seeger sings
for Hudson River sloop."

694
00:33:00.679 --> 00:33:04.350
I got in my car.
and it was a little concert

695
00:33:04.416 --> 00:33:06.518
in Garrison. New York.

696
00:33:06.585 --> 00:33:09.721
directly across
from West Point.

697
00:33:12.891 --> 00:33:15.727
And then I find
Osborne's Castle.

698
00:33:15.794 --> 00:33:18.364
which is where
this event was held.

699
00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:20.866
The castle was way up
on the hill.

700
00:33:20.932 --> 00:33:24.070
but there was this low area
with rolling fields.

701
00:33:24.136 --> 00:33:28.674
- * I'm gonna lay down
my sword and shield *

702
00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:31.643
* Down by the riverside *

703
00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:35.647
- Seeger. he plays banjo
on this plywood stage

704
00:33:35.714 --> 00:33:37.516
and the one microphone.

705
00:33:37.583 --> 00:33:40.186
and then during a break.
I introduced myself.

706
00:33:40.252 --> 00:33:42.088
and he knew who I was
because I'd been writing him

707
00:33:42.154 --> 00:33:43.789
since junior high school.

708
00:33:43.855 --> 00:33:48.527
And he liked me and he asked
me to be on a concert in 1968.

709
00:33:48.594 --> 00:33:51.397
And I got right involved
with that. right away.

710
00:33:51.463 --> 00:33:55.801
all: * Bye. bye-bye.
bye-bye. bye-bye *

711
00:33:55.867 --> 00:33:58.070
- He took me under his wing
and brought me around

712
00:33:58.137 --> 00:34:01.373
and had me open for him
or be a guest on his show.

713
00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.642
and then he put this gang
of singers together.

714
00:34:03.709 --> 00:34:05.010
and I was part of that.

715
00:34:05.077 --> 00:34:09.915
- * Well. I thought
I heard the captain say *

716
00:34:09.981 --> 00:34:12.718
- Suddenly.
I'm in this whole world.

717
00:34:12.784 --> 00:34:16.655
It's art. it's recordings.
it's live performing.

718
00:34:19.191 --> 00:34:22.528
Seeger took us to the Newport
Folk Festival in 1969.

719
00:34:22.594 --> 00:34:24.730
That was a big deal.

720
00:34:24.796 --> 00:34:27.533
It's still one of the high
points of my entire life.

721
00:34:29.067 --> 00:34:33.739
Van Morrison. James Taylor.
Muddy Waters was there.

722
00:34:35.541 --> 00:34:36.975
Somehow or other.

723
00:34:37.042 --> 00:34:40.412
they let the Everly Brothers
come to Newport--

724
00:34:40.479 --> 00:34:41.747
rock 'n' roll.

725
00:34:41.813 --> 00:34:44.483
- * Gimme
rock 'n' roll music *

726
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:47.386
* Whoo. any old way
you choose it *

727
00:34:47.453 --> 00:34:48.920
- Wow.

728
00:34:48.987 --> 00:34:54.793
They came on stage.
and they were incredible.

729
00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:57.863
- * If you knew. Peggy Sue *

730
00:34:57.929 --> 00:35:01.533
* Just how my heart yearned
for you. oh. Peggy *

731
00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:02.968
- I had been reading.
you know.

732
00:35:03.034 --> 00:35:04.703
what little bit I could.
and I knew

733
00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:07.539
that the Everlys were
very close to Buddy Holly.

734
00:35:07.606 --> 00:35:10.509
- * I need you. Peggy Sue *

735
00:35:10.576 --> 00:35:12.311
- So after the show was over.

736
00:35:12.378 --> 00:35:14.713
I had to say hello to them.

737
00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:17.115
So I went to Phil Everly.
and I said.

738
00:35:17.183 --> 00:35:19.551
"You know. I know
that you knew Buddy Holly.

739
00:35:19.618 --> 00:35:22.288
Could you tell me a little bit
about him and what happened?"

740
00:35:22.354 --> 00:35:25.391
He said. "We were very
good friends." he said.

741
00:35:25.457 --> 00:35:27.326
"And Buddy decided
to take a plane

742
00:35:27.393 --> 00:35:30.629
to get out ahead of the tour
to get his laundry done."

743
00:35:30.696 --> 00:35:35.100
"He died for dirty laundry."
I thought to myself. Wow.

744
00:35:35.167 --> 00:35:37.536
Man. he's a human being

745
00:35:37.603 --> 00:35:39.971
with a sack of dirty clothes.

746
00:35:40.038 --> 00:35:42.774
Gee. the whole thing
started coming back.

747
00:35:42.841 --> 00:35:47.979
Front and center. it was
absolutely haunting me now.

748
00:35:49.581 --> 00:35:54.720
- * A long. long time ago *

749
00:35:54.786 --> 00:35:56.455
When you look back
at Garth Brooks' career.

750
00:35:56.522 --> 00:35:57.989
if you remember
anything from it.

751
00:35:58.056 --> 00:36:00.292
you'll remember Central Park
will be the crown jewel.

752
00:36:00.359 --> 00:36:03.094
1997. August 7.
beautiful night.

753
00:36:03.161 --> 00:36:06.632
* And I knew
if I had my chance *

754
00:36:06.698 --> 00:36:08.634
- Garth Brooks.
I'd heard about him singing

755
00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.536
"American Pie"
from the beginning

756
00:36:10.602 --> 00:36:12.170
when he was just
getting started.

757
00:36:12.238 --> 00:36:14.473
Then bigger. bigger. bigger.
every year. bigger.

758
00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:16.174
always singing this song.

759
00:36:16.242 --> 00:36:20.512
So the big word now is that
he's gonna play Central Park.

760
00:36:20.579 --> 00:36:23.782
- * With every paper
I'd deliver *

761
00:36:23.849 --> 00:36:27.052
- So I get a fax.
he wants me to be on the show.

762
00:36:27.118 --> 00:36:30.589
- * I couldn't take
one more step *

763
00:36:30.656 --> 00:36:33.325
We had a million
people show up. live TV.

764
00:36:33.392 --> 00:36:35.060
It could not be going better.

765
00:36:35.126 --> 00:36:39.331
and then we go into our final
leg of our stuff.

766
00:36:39.398 --> 00:36:43.201
and knowing that you're
about to tell these people

767
00:36:43.269 --> 00:36:46.272
that Don McLean's gonna come
out and sing "American Pie."

768
00:36:46.338 --> 00:36:48.139
you were 16-foot tall.

769
00:36:48.206 --> 00:36:49.174
You knew it.

770
00:36:49.241 --> 00:36:51.076
Ladies and gentlemen.

771
00:36:51.142 --> 00:36:53.712
it's a great honor
and a great privilege.

772
00:36:53.779 --> 00:36:55.146
Mr. Don McLean.

773
00:36:55.213 --> 00:36:58.817
[cheers and applause]

774
00:36:58.884 --> 00:37:03.722
And when I introduced him.
God. he looked fantastic.

775
00:37:03.789 --> 00:37:05.724
He came out with that smile.

776
00:37:05.791 --> 00:37:08.460
and he gets to be the guy
in the cape.

777
00:37:08.527 --> 00:37:11.229
And he wears
the cape well. man.

778
00:37:14.266 --> 00:37:16.868
- Sing the chorus again!

779
00:37:16.935 --> 00:37:20.238
* Bye-bye. Miss American Pie *

780
00:37:20.306 --> 00:37:24.810
* Drove my Chevy to the levee.
but the levee was dry *

781
00:37:24.876 --> 00:37:27.513
- He comes out.
and he just gets

782
00:37:27.579 --> 00:37:31.016
that big old guitar going.
and it's just a little slower.

783
00:37:31.082 --> 00:37:34.853
so you see all million
people just kind of lean in.

784
00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.956
and everybody's
inner child comes out.

785
00:37:38.023 --> 00:37:40.726
- * And I went down
to the sacred store *

786
00:37:40.792 --> 00:37:44.162
* Where I'd heard
the music years before *

787
00:37:44.229 --> 00:37:48.434
* But the man there said
the music wouldn't play *

788
00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:51.236
I like a crowd that's happy.

789
00:37:51.303 --> 00:37:52.671
And they were very happy.

790
00:37:52.738 --> 00:37:55.106
It was a summer night.
and they were loose.

791
00:37:55.173 --> 00:37:57.242
and they were ready.
and I love that.

792
00:37:57.309 --> 00:38:03.949
both:
* Bye-bye. Miss American Pie *

793
00:38:04.015 --> 00:38:10.922
* Drove my Chevy to the levee.
but the levee was dry *

794
00:38:10.989 --> 00:38:14.326
- "American Pie" isn't
about a nation as much

795
00:38:14.393 --> 00:38:17.796
as it is about that drive
of independence.

796
00:38:17.863 --> 00:38:19.398
that drive of discovery.

797
00:38:19.465 --> 00:38:22.267
that drive of believing
anything is possible.

798
00:38:22.334 --> 00:38:24.202
Freedom within you.

799
00:38:24.269 --> 00:38:25.871
Okay now. New York.

800
00:38:25.937 --> 00:38:29.508
We want to hear
just you guys singing.

801
00:38:29.575 --> 00:38:31.710
* We were singin'... *

802
00:38:31.777 --> 00:38:33.078
all: * Bye-bye... *

803
00:38:33.144 --> 00:38:36.848
- People found a road map
in this song

804
00:38:36.915 --> 00:38:38.684
that is a million
different things

805
00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:40.085
to a million different people.

806
00:38:40.151 --> 00:38:42.554
"American Pie" is one
of those few songs

807
00:38:42.621 --> 00:38:43.889
you can stand behind and go.

808
00:38:43.955 --> 00:38:45.924
"This is what
the power of music is."

809
00:38:45.991 --> 00:38:50.228
both:
* Bye-bye. Miss American Pie *

810
00:38:50.295 --> 00:38:53.031
- Talk about the perfect night
needs the perfect ending.

811
00:38:53.098 --> 00:38:54.433
how about pulling one
of the greatest

812
00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:57.403
singer-songwriter artists
in history out?

813
00:38:57.469 --> 00:38:59.538
How about him singing
his ass off.

814
00:38:59.605 --> 00:39:02.608
and then. oh. yeah.
this could quite possibly be

815
00:39:02.674 --> 00:39:04.443
the greatest song
in music history

816
00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:07.078
that you get to end the biggest
night of your career on.

817
00:39:07.145 --> 00:39:08.580
Don McLean!

818
00:39:08.647 --> 00:39:10.315
[cheers and applause]

819
00:39:10.382 --> 00:39:13.452
I think you're looking
at a 50-year-old song

820
00:39:13.519 --> 00:39:15.987
that gets prettier every year.

821
00:39:16.054 --> 00:39:18.089
classier every year.

822
00:39:18.156 --> 00:39:20.459
This thing--
this thing is timeless.

823
00:39:20.526 --> 00:39:24.696
because no one's ever written
anything like it since.

824
00:39:24.763 --> 00:39:27.399
[country music]

825
00:39:27.466 --> 00:39:29.468
* *

826
00:39:29.535 --> 00:39:31.202
- I graduated in 1968

827
00:39:31.269 --> 00:39:33.972
with this degree
that I knew I'd never use.

828
00:39:35.373 --> 00:39:39.645
In 1969. I had just been
out of school a year

829
00:39:39.711 --> 00:39:42.781
and I had a three-album deal
with Media Arts Records.

830
00:39:42.848 --> 00:39:44.883
* And if she asks you why *

831
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:47.986
* You can then tell her
that I told you *

832
00:39:48.053 --> 00:39:51.657
* That I'm tired
of castles in the air *

833
00:39:51.723 --> 00:39:54.192
I moved up
to the Hudson River.

834
00:39:54.259 --> 00:39:56.495
* Hills of forest green *

835
00:39:56.562 --> 00:39:59.130
* Where the mountains
touch the sky *

836
00:39:59.197 --> 00:40:01.867
I lived in this
little gate house

837
00:40:01.933 --> 00:40:04.736
to an estate
in Cold Spring. New York.

838
00:40:04.803 --> 00:40:06.972
It was pretty primitive.

839
00:40:07.038 --> 00:40:09.675
No heat.
very cold in the winter.

840
00:40:09.741 --> 00:40:12.210
but I rented it
very inexpensively.

841
00:40:12.277 --> 00:40:17.382
* Save me from all
the trouble and the pain *

842
00:40:17.449 --> 00:40:19.084
Up on the second floor.

843
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:20.886
there was a tiny
little bedroom.

844
00:40:20.952 --> 00:40:24.122
and there was a chair
I put rockers on.

845
00:40:24.189 --> 00:40:26.224
and I would rock
on that thing

846
00:40:26.291 --> 00:40:30.161
and type on my little
typewriter and write songs.

847
00:40:30.228 --> 00:40:32.063
* Why I can't remain *

848
00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:34.265
I was writing furiously now.

849
00:40:34.332 --> 00:40:36.401
I was inspired
by the people that I met.

850
00:40:36.468 --> 00:40:38.069
the artists. the writers.

851
00:40:38.136 --> 00:40:41.372
the scientists.
the political people.

852
00:40:41.439 --> 00:40:45.110
And the first album
I made was called "Tapestry."

853
00:40:45.176 --> 00:40:47.979
And I'm making "Tapestry"
in 1969

854
00:40:48.046 --> 00:40:51.917
in Berkeley. California.
and there'd be a small riot

855
00:40:51.983 --> 00:40:54.419
every day I was making
that record.

856
00:40:54.486 --> 00:40:58.790
They are gassing the guys
coming to the sessions.

857
00:40:58.857 --> 00:41:01.126
like. every day.
so I'm thinking.

858
00:41:01.192 --> 00:41:03.895
it's crazy. what's gonna
happen to the country now?

859
00:41:03.962 --> 00:41:05.296
Things are getting worse.

860
00:41:08.967 --> 00:41:12.070
We had
had numerous assassinations

861
00:41:12.137 --> 00:41:13.972
throughout the '60s.

862
00:41:15.273 --> 00:41:17.008
The Kennedy assassination.

863
00:41:17.075 --> 00:41:19.277
Martin Luther King.

864
00:41:19.344 --> 00:41:22.213
and RFK.

865
00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:24.415
We had the war in Vietnam.

866
00:41:26.885 --> 00:41:28.987
Rage against Nixon

867
00:41:29.054 --> 00:41:32.257
and the chaotic insanity
that was out there.

868
00:41:34.092 --> 00:41:36.127
It broke up families.

869
00:41:36.194 --> 00:41:37.963
tearing the whole place apart.

870
00:41:39.565 --> 00:41:43.401
The country was
in an advanced state

871
00:41:43.468 --> 00:41:44.903
of psychic shock.

872
00:41:46.437 --> 00:41:49.207
Drugs everywhere.
Everybody's smoking dope

873
00:41:49.274 --> 00:41:51.376
and sleeping
with everybody else.

874
00:41:53.478 --> 00:41:56.615
And all this bedlam
and riots and burning cities.

875
00:41:56.682 --> 00:42:00.151
and I'm always standing back
trying to read the signs.

876
00:42:00.218 --> 00:42:01.887
All right. what's this mean?

877
00:42:01.953 --> 00:42:04.122
You know.
and tried to put it somehow

878
00:42:04.189 --> 00:42:06.925
in my simple way
into some of these songs.

879
00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:11.129
I was working
on this second record.

880
00:42:11.196 --> 00:42:12.898
but I wasn't happy with it.

881
00:42:12.964 --> 00:42:16.968
and so I said. "I got to have
a big song about America."

882
00:42:17.035 --> 00:42:19.170
I just really knew
I wanted to do this.

883
00:42:23.775 --> 00:42:27.913
One day. I was up there
sitting on the little bed.

884
00:42:27.979 --> 00:42:31.249
and I turned
this tape recorder on.

885
00:42:31.316 --> 00:42:35.153
and I just started singing...

886
00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:38.456
* A long. long time ago *

887
00:42:38.523 --> 00:42:43.829
* I can still remember how that
music used to make me smile *

888
00:42:45.496 --> 00:42:47.465
[recording] * And I knew
if I had my chance *

889
00:42:47.532 --> 00:42:49.768
* That I could make
those people dance *

890
00:42:49.835 --> 00:42:54.005
* And maybe they'd
be happy for a while *

891
00:42:54.072 --> 00:42:57.676
* But February
made me shiver *

892
00:42:57.743 --> 00:43:00.378
* With every paper
I'd deliver *

893
00:43:00.445 --> 00:43:03.014
* Bad news on the doorstep *

894
00:43:03.081 --> 00:43:06.618
* I couldn't take
one more step *

895
00:43:06.685 --> 00:43:08.419
* I can't remember
if I cried *

896
00:43:08.486 --> 00:43:11.923
* When I read
about his widowed bride *

897
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:15.727
[live] * But something
touched me deep inside *

898
00:43:15.794 --> 00:43:21.900
* The day the music died *

899
00:43:21.967 --> 00:43:25.436
I said. whoa.

900
00:43:25.503 --> 00:43:27.138
What is that?

901
00:43:27.205 --> 00:43:29.775
This whole thing was
coming up in me.

902
00:43:29.841 --> 00:43:35.046
for all those years before
of thinking of Buddy.

903
00:43:35.113 --> 00:43:37.148
and it all came out
right through

904
00:43:37.215 --> 00:43:38.684
to the day the music died.

905
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:41.419
Every single word
I wrote just came

906
00:43:41.486 --> 00:43:43.655
like a genie out of a bottle.

907
00:43:43.722 --> 00:43:47.358
And I said to myself.
"Wow. I got something."

908
00:43:47.425 --> 00:43:50.595
So I'm thinking
as a few weeks went by.

909
00:43:50.662 --> 00:43:52.597
I don't want this
to be a ballad.

910
00:43:52.664 --> 00:43:55.734
so I got to write
a hot chorus.

911
00:43:55.801 --> 00:43:57.102
I waited a long time.

912
00:43:57.168 --> 00:43:59.304
and then I came up
with this crazy chorus.

913
00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:03.008
[recording] * So bye-bye.
Miss American Pie *

914
00:44:03.074 --> 00:44:07.545
* I drove me Chevy to the
levee. but the levee was dry *

915
00:44:07.612 --> 00:44:11.216
* Them good old boys were
drinking whiskey and rye *

916
00:44:11.282 --> 00:44:15.620
* And singing. "This'll
be the day that I die" *

917
00:44:15.687 --> 00:44:19.324
* This'll be the day
that I die *

918
00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:21.259
I had already written
about the idea.

919
00:44:21.326 --> 00:44:23.528
the Holly thing was now
right front and center.

920
00:44:23.594 --> 00:44:25.330
and so I said. "This'll
be the day that I die."

921
00:44:25.396 --> 00:44:26.898
I had to have that in there.

922
00:44:26.965 --> 00:44:30.501
You know. that way I keep it
flowing forward in the chorus.

923
00:44:30.568 --> 00:44:33.104
It was from. "That'll
Be the Day That I Die."

924
00:44:33.171 --> 00:44:35.306
Buddy learned that phrase

925
00:44:35.373 --> 00:44:37.709
from "The Searchers."
the John Wayne movie

926
00:44:37.776 --> 00:44:40.645
where the Duke says.
"That'll be the day."

927
00:44:40.712 --> 00:44:44.649
And there was a song
that Pete Seeger used to sing.

928
00:44:44.716 --> 00:44:47.118
and it was called
"Bye-bye. My Roseanna."

929
00:44:47.185 --> 00:44:48.519
And he would sing...

930
00:44:48.586 --> 00:44:52.791
both: * Bye-bye. bye-bye.
bye-bye. bye-bye *

931
00:44:52.858 --> 00:44:56.995
* Bye-bye. my Roseanna *

932
00:44:57.062 --> 00:44:59.064
And that "bye-bye" thing
stayed in my head.

933
00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:02.500
I think. from that one.
so I put it in there.

934
00:45:02.567 --> 00:45:06.704
I chose "American Pie."
because you're as American.

935
00:45:06.772 --> 00:45:09.307
as apple pie. but I just
dropped the apple out.

936
00:45:09.374 --> 00:45:13.278
and I said. "American Pie.
whoa. that's great."

937
00:45:13.344 --> 00:45:15.546
I knew I had the tiger
by the tail.

938
00:45:15.613 --> 00:45:18.316
[stirring music]

939
00:45:18.383 --> 00:45:20.285
I got this hot chorus.

940
00:45:20.351 --> 00:45:22.387
and I got
this beautiful opening.

941
00:45:22.453 --> 00:45:25.390
and now I'm thinking.
well. where do I go with this?

942
00:45:25.456 --> 00:45:28.093
'Cause I want to write a song
about America.

943
00:45:28.159 --> 00:45:29.694
but I don't want
to write a song

944
00:45:29.761 --> 00:45:33.965
like anybody ever wrote
about America before.

945
00:45:34.032 --> 00:45:36.534
[birds chirping]

946
00:45:36.601 --> 00:45:39.504
[stirring music]

947
00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:41.239
* *

948
00:45:41.306 --> 00:45:42.540
- I was second-generation.

949
00:45:42.607 --> 00:45:44.642
'cause I grew up
in a Greek household.

950
00:45:44.709 --> 00:45:47.478
I was born in San Francisco.
only there for a year.

951
00:45:47.545 --> 00:45:49.714
in LA another year. and then
grew up in Gary. Indiana.

952
00:45:51.316 --> 00:45:52.884
Before even I'm an artist.

953
00:45:52.951 --> 00:45:55.153
I'm somebody who's just
interested in the humanities

954
00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:56.822
and in history. you know.
and philosophy.

955
00:45:56.888 --> 00:45:58.489
especially. and poetry.

956
00:45:58.556 --> 00:46:00.725
And a lot of these people
that I've sculpted

957
00:46:00.792 --> 00:46:02.593
have pressed
the boundaries of things.

958
00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:04.329
They wanted
to see a better world.

959
00:46:04.395 --> 00:46:06.531
they wanted
to be part of that.

960
00:46:08.066 --> 00:46:09.767
Don. I had seen him in a show.

961
00:46:09.835 --> 00:46:11.970
"The American Dream Machine."
and I thought. wow.

962
00:46:12.037 --> 00:46:13.371
It was so sensitive.

963
00:46:13.438 --> 00:46:15.773
and he was reshaping how
I thought about the ecology.

964
00:46:18.209 --> 00:46:19.710
I said I'd like to sculpt him.

965
00:46:19.777 --> 00:46:21.479
and I think
the first time he sat.

966
00:46:21.546 --> 00:46:24.615
he played the guitar
for ten hours straight.

967
00:46:24.682 --> 00:46:25.884
Then he came here
and did the same thing

968
00:46:25.951 --> 00:46:27.118
right in this very room.

969
00:46:29.254 --> 00:46:31.489
He doesn't miss a thing.

970
00:46:31.556 --> 00:46:34.659
He's very open to the muse.

971
00:46:34.725 --> 00:46:37.328
so all that goes
into the music.

972
00:46:37.395 --> 00:46:38.629
"American Pie" is
"War and Peace."

973
00:46:38.696 --> 00:46:42.267
It's the "Moby Dick."
It's the big novel.

974
00:46:42.333 --> 00:46:44.435
He has a narrative
like a dream.

975
00:46:44.502 --> 00:46:45.971
You create all the characters
in your dreams.

976
00:46:46.037 --> 00:46:47.538
so you're part of all of them.

977
00:46:47.605 --> 00:46:49.841
You know.
the jester and the king.

978
00:46:49.908 --> 00:46:52.743
He was there at the right time
and captured so much

979
00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:55.213
of that history
that he was part of too.

980
00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:57.215
but he knows
that history so well.

981
00:46:59.184 --> 00:47:00.718
If Don hadn't written
"American Pie."

982
00:47:00.785 --> 00:47:02.420
no one would
ever have written it.

983
00:47:02.487 --> 00:47:04.622
See. it's unique
to who he was.

984
00:47:04.689 --> 00:47:07.225
where in space
and time he grew up.

985
00:47:10.795 --> 00:47:13.498
We're in front
of my Freedom Sculpture.

986
00:47:13.564 --> 00:47:15.867
You see the struggle
to break free.

987
00:47:17.869 --> 00:47:20.638
And I wanted to put a poet
in my sculpture.

988
00:47:20.705 --> 00:47:23.441
and the poet in my life.
besides reading Robert Frost

989
00:47:23.508 --> 00:47:25.710
and T.S. Eliot and others.
was Don McLean.

990
00:47:27.778 --> 00:47:30.548
Don's song. "American Pie."
is an epic song.

991
00:47:30.615 --> 00:47:32.050
not just because
of its length.

992
00:47:32.117 --> 00:47:33.851
but because of its scope.

993
00:47:33.919 --> 00:47:37.488
and I wanted to have some
sense of that in my sculpture.

994
00:47:39.357 --> 00:47:42.193
"American Pie" is
an open-ended piece.

995
00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:43.962
It's not so specific

996
00:47:44.029 --> 00:47:46.331
that you can't put yourself
in there.

997
00:47:47.665 --> 00:47:49.200
What happens
with Don McLean's song.

998
00:47:49.267 --> 00:47:52.803
and with this for me.
is if you leave it open-ended.

999
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:55.140
you're inviting people
to participate and to have

1000
00:47:55.206 --> 00:47:57.608
a dialogue with you.
to make themselves part of it.

1001
00:47:57.675 --> 00:47:59.710
and they become
very emotionally involved.

1002
00:48:02.347 --> 00:48:05.583
With Don. "American Pie".
there are little mysteries.

1003
00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:07.752
and Don is about mystery
with his music.

1004
00:48:07.818 --> 00:48:09.520
He even talks about his song.
"American Pie."

1005
00:48:09.587 --> 00:48:11.456
being a kind of a dream.

1006
00:48:11.522 --> 00:48:12.991
Turning your dreams
into reality

1007
00:48:13.058 --> 00:48:14.725
is what we do as artists.

1008
00:48:20.498 --> 00:48:23.334
[Tim Hardin's
"Bird on the Wire"]

1009
00:48:23.401 --> 00:48:25.403
* *

1010
00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:28.306
I was working on this
"American Pie" song.

1011
00:48:28.373 --> 00:48:30.508
and I had eight or nine songs

1012
00:48:30.575 --> 00:48:32.743
that were going
to go on the album.

1013
00:48:32.810 --> 00:48:34.845
and now the question was
how to make

1014
00:48:34.912 --> 00:48:36.447
a good record out of it.

1015
00:48:36.514 --> 00:48:39.350
- * I have tried in my way *

1016
00:48:39.417 --> 00:48:40.918
- I heard a couple of records.

1017
00:48:40.986 --> 00:48:43.188
one by Tim Hardin
called "Bird on a Wire."

1018
00:48:43.254 --> 00:48:45.423
- * Tried in my way *

1019
00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:46.958
- Ooh. I liked that record.

1020
00:48:47.025 --> 00:48:48.926
There was some
nice things on there.

1021
00:48:48.994 --> 00:48:50.561
- * Free *

1022
00:48:50.628 --> 00:48:52.830
- Ed Freeman is the producer.

1023
00:48:52.897 --> 00:48:55.733
so I said.
I want this guy. Ed Freeman.

1024
00:48:58.036 --> 00:49:01.106
- Don came over
to my apartment in New York

1025
00:49:01.172 --> 00:49:04.042
and played me some songs.
and I wasn't

1026
00:49:04.109 --> 00:49:05.776
all that impressed. frankly.

1027
00:49:05.843 --> 00:49:10.348
But I needed a job.
so I thought. well. okay.

1028
00:49:10.415 --> 00:49:13.484
And then. slowly.
as we started working.

1029
00:49:13.551 --> 00:49:15.586
I started realizing.
oh. wait a minute.

1030
00:49:15.653 --> 00:49:17.855
this guy is the real deal.

1031
00:49:20.825 --> 00:49:23.228
- I had the album. I knew
how I wanted it to sound.

1032
00:49:23.294 --> 00:49:24.895
I had the producer.

1033
00:49:24.962 --> 00:49:28.133
It was all progressing.
but I didn't have the big one.

1034
00:49:28.199 --> 00:49:32.637
and the big one had
to blow them all away.

1035
00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:38.543
- I remember Don played me
the first verse

1036
00:49:38.609 --> 00:49:40.645
and chorus of "American Pie."

1037
00:49:40.711 --> 00:49:43.348
and he said he hadn't finished
writing it at that point.

1038
00:49:43.414 --> 00:49:45.150
so I said.
"You should finish that.

1039
00:49:45.216 --> 00:49:47.285
that it sounds
like it could be a hit."

1040
00:49:49.087 --> 00:49:51.889
- Now I'm thinking.
well. where do I go with this?

1041
00:49:51.956 --> 00:49:54.159
'Cause I want to write
a song about the new America.

1042
00:49:54.225 --> 00:49:57.195
which is rock 'n' roll.
which is people's involvement

1043
00:49:57.262 --> 00:50:00.731
in politics and the connection
between all that.

1044
00:50:00.798 --> 00:50:03.301
rather than. you know.
"My Country. 'Tis of Thee."

1045
00:50:03.368 --> 00:50:05.036
or "This Land is your Land."

1046
00:50:05.103 --> 00:50:09.474
* So bye-bye.
Miss American Pie *

1047
00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:10.975
* I drove my Chevy
to the levee *

1048
00:50:11.042 --> 00:50:12.710
The chorus came out.
and then when I had that.

1049
00:50:12.777 --> 00:50:14.479
I said. well.
I've got the engine now

1050
00:50:14.545 --> 00:50:15.880
to get this thing going.

1051
00:50:15.946 --> 00:50:19.584
All I've got to do
is sing the slow part

1052
00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:22.587
of the song
to a rock 'n' roll beat.

1053
00:50:22.653 --> 00:50:25.256
In other words. and take
"A long. long time ago.

1054
00:50:25.323 --> 00:50:26.857
Did you write
the book of love?"

1055
00:50:26.924 --> 00:50:30.461
It's the same thing.
sped up to rock 'n' roll.

1056
00:50:30.528 --> 00:50:33.131
* Did you write
the book of love? *

1057
00:50:33.198 --> 00:50:36.534
* And do you have faith
in God above? *

1058
00:50:36.601 --> 00:50:38.669
And it must have been
a month or two later.

1059
00:50:38.736 --> 00:50:41.739
I wrote all the verses in.
like. an hour.

1060
00:50:41.806 --> 00:50:44.975
* Do you believe
in rock and roll? *

1061
00:50:45.042 --> 00:50:47.678
I was building it.
I could hear it.

1062
00:50:47.745 --> 00:50:49.347
I could feel it.
that something was going on.

1063
00:50:49.414 --> 00:50:50.915
bigger than me.

1064
00:50:50.981 --> 00:50:53.851
I was trying to create
some sort of an abstract.

1065
00:50:53.918 --> 00:50:57.788
dream-like story
about America.

1066
00:50:57.855 --> 00:51:00.958
* Well. I know that you're
in love with him *

1067
00:51:01.025 --> 00:51:04.395
* I. I saw you dancing
in the gym *

1068
00:51:04.462 --> 00:51:06.564
The song came to me
in one shot.

1069
00:51:06.631 --> 00:51:08.766
There were a lot
of spiral notebook pages.

1070
00:51:08.833 --> 00:51:11.569
and I say how the song
is gonna be constructed.

1071
00:51:11.636 --> 00:51:14.272
I make a little blueprint
of the song.

1072
00:51:14.339 --> 00:51:18.709
* In a coat he borrowed
from James Dean. and a voice *

1073
00:51:18.776 --> 00:51:22.180
After I wrote the whole thing.
I'm sure I sat down.

1074
00:51:22.247 --> 00:51:23.314
and I was still trying
to figure out

1075
00:51:23.381 --> 00:51:24.682
how to get out of it.

1076
00:51:24.749 --> 00:51:26.984
* And when he'd had
enough of that *

1077
00:51:27.051 --> 00:51:30.221
* He pinched the queen
and passed the hat *

1078
00:51:30.288 --> 00:51:32.257
You know. it couldn't end
and it couldn't fade.

1079
00:51:32.323 --> 00:51:33.658
so I didn't know what to do.

1080
00:51:33.724 --> 00:51:34.759
So I thought. well.
the only thing I can do

1081
00:51:34.825 --> 00:51:36.561
is slow down like it started.

1082
00:51:36.627 --> 00:51:39.464
Perfect. Exactly right.

1083
00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:41.932
* And the three men
I admire most *

1084
00:51:41.999 --> 00:51:44.335
* The Father. Son.
and the Holy Ghost *

1085
00:51:44.402 --> 00:51:47.205
- Then. of course. he finished
"American Pie." and I thought.

1086
00:51:47.272 --> 00:51:50.541
well. no radio station
is gonna play this thing

1087
00:51:50.608 --> 00:51:53.077
because it's 8.5 minutes long.

1088
00:51:53.144 --> 00:51:54.979
but it's a really good song.

1089
00:51:55.045 --> 00:51:59.450
- * Bye-bye.
Miss American Pie *

1090
00:51:59.517 --> 00:52:01.286
I just knew I had something

1091
00:52:01.352 --> 00:52:04.755
that I thought was incredibly
great and fun.

1092
00:52:04.822 --> 00:52:07.892
but that nobody else might
dig at all.

1093
00:52:07.958 --> 00:52:14.332
* Singing. "This'll be
the day that I die" *

1094
00:52:14.399 --> 00:52:17.034
That's enough for today.
[laughs]

1095
00:52:18.636 --> 00:52:21.206
[martial music]

1096
00:52:21.272 --> 00:52:23.274
- Welcome to Philadelphia.

1097
00:52:23.341 --> 00:52:25.610
It's a beautiful city
on a beautiful day.

1098
00:52:25.676 --> 00:52:28.846
and it's my pleasure
to show you my hometown.

1099
00:52:28.913 --> 00:52:31.081
This building right here
is the true

1100
00:52:31.148 --> 00:52:32.883
ground zero
of the United States.

1101
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:36.187
Independence Hall
established justice.

1102
00:52:36.254 --> 00:52:38.589
This is where the Declaration
of Independence

1103
00:52:38.656 --> 00:52:39.957
"promote the general welfare."

1104
00:52:40.024 --> 00:52:41.859
The articles of Confederation

1105
00:52:41.926 --> 00:52:43.928
"ensure domestic tranquility."

1106
00:52:43.994 --> 00:52:46.431
and the Constitution
of the United States

1107
00:52:46.497 --> 00:52:47.765
were all written and signed.

1108
00:52:47.832 --> 00:52:50.768
That is the birthplace
of the United States.

1109
00:52:52.102 --> 00:52:55.673
My name is Clark DeLeon.
and I saw Don McLean sing

1110
00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:57.508
"American Pie"
for the first time.

1111
00:52:57.575 --> 00:53:00.645
[dreamy music]

1112
00:53:00.711 --> 00:53:02.913
The story was that Don
performed "American Pie"

1113
00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:05.750
for the first time
at Temple University.

1114
00:53:05.816 --> 00:53:08.686
but I know this happened
at St. Joe's University

1115
00:53:08.753 --> 00:53:10.955
at the field house.

1116
00:53:11.021 --> 00:53:13.624
I am a columnist at
the "Philadelphia Inquirer."

1117
00:53:13.691 --> 00:53:15.860
so I wrote about it.
I talked to Don McLean

1118
00:53:15.926 --> 00:53:17.862
and I just set
the record straight.

1119
00:53:17.928 --> 00:53:20.665
And then when I called him up.
he readily admitted it.

1120
00:53:20.731 --> 00:53:25.236
* *

1121
00:53:25.303 --> 00:53:27.004
It was March.
it was a rainy day.

1122
00:53:27.071 --> 00:53:29.440
My wife and I went
to see Laura Nyro.

1123
00:53:29.507 --> 00:53:33.278
Now. Don McLean was just a
throw in and the opening act.

1124
00:53:33.344 --> 00:53:35.045
So we got there.
and this field house.

1125
00:53:35.112 --> 00:53:36.914
I remember we were
sitting in the side.

1126
00:53:36.981 --> 00:53:39.550
He came out and was just--
immediately had the crowd.

1127
00:53:39.617 --> 00:53:41.719
but then he said.
"I've got this new song.

1128
00:53:41.786 --> 00:53:43.921
It's so new. I haven't
even learned all the words."

1129
00:53:43.988 --> 00:53:45.556
And he said.
"I'm gonna need some help

1130
00:53:45.623 --> 00:53:46.957
"from the audience here.

1131
00:53:47.024 --> 00:53:48.959
Can you--" and he holds it
to a young woman.

1132
00:53:49.026 --> 00:53:50.361
"Would you mind
holding these up?"

1133
00:53:50.428 --> 00:53:52.997
while he began the song.

1134
00:53:53.063 --> 00:53:55.266
- * A long. long time ago *

1135
00:53:55.333 --> 00:53:58.769
* I can still remember
how that music *

1136
00:53:58.836 --> 00:54:01.406
* used to make me smile *

1137
00:54:01.472 --> 00:54:04.642
In '70. I was still
doing double bills.

1138
00:54:04.709 --> 00:54:06.477
and I was opening
for Laura Nyro.

1139
00:54:06.544 --> 00:54:07.945
After I had written the song

1140
00:54:08.012 --> 00:54:10.848
and I had all the handwritten
pages and stuff.

1141
00:54:10.915 --> 00:54:14.051
I went and typed up something
so I could remember it.

1142
00:54:14.118 --> 00:54:17.288
and I seem to remember
that I had a little girl come

1143
00:54:17.355 --> 00:54:20.458
out of the crowd. and I gave
her the lyrics to hold.

1144
00:54:20.525 --> 00:54:22.293
and I sang the song.

1145
00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:25.730
* And while Lennon read
a book on Marx *

1146
00:54:25.796 --> 00:54:28.799
- The actual singing
of the song got lost

1147
00:54:28.866 --> 00:54:31.702
in my memory
of all these words. you know.

1148
00:54:31.769 --> 00:54:33.170
and you didn't know
what the song was about.

1149
00:54:33.237 --> 00:54:35.105
you just knew it had
a really snappy chorus.

1150
00:54:35.172 --> 00:54:36.807
And of course.
by the end of it.

1151
00:54:36.874 --> 00:54:38.108
everyone's
singing "American Pie."

1152
00:54:38.175 --> 00:54:39.344
It was great.

1153
00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:42.847
- * Bye-bye.
Miss American Pie *

1154
00:54:42.913 --> 00:54:44.482
- What was the crowd reaction?

1155
00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:46.283
- Not much. Okay.

1156
00:54:46.351 --> 00:54:47.818
Because the song was
so different.

1157
00:54:47.885 --> 00:54:49.620
they never heard
anything like it.

1158
00:54:49.687 --> 00:54:52.122
* This'll be the day
that I die *

1159
00:54:52.189 --> 00:54:54.058
You know. you can
get immediate reaction

1160
00:54:54.124 --> 00:54:55.793
from an audience.
it doesn't necessarily

1161
00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:57.194
mean the song's any good.

1162
00:54:57.261 --> 00:54:59.797
You know. this had to be
made into a record.

1163
00:54:59.864 --> 00:55:02.199
* The day that I die *

1164
00:55:02.266 --> 00:55:04.402
- By the end of the song. you
knew something was going on.

1165
00:55:04.469 --> 00:55:06.504
He said. you might
be hearing this soon.

1166
00:55:06.571 --> 00:55:07.772
He said that from the stage.

1167
00:55:07.838 --> 00:55:09.574
and he was right.

1168
00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:13.378
[atmospheric music]

1169
00:55:13.444 --> 00:55:16.547
- One of the most talented
young singer-songwriters

1170
00:55:16.614 --> 00:55:18.383
I know.
his name is Don McLean.

1171
00:55:18.449 --> 00:55:20.651
and he's just written
a brand-new song

1172
00:55:20.718 --> 00:55:22.620
that has got me bugged.

1173
00:55:22.687 --> 00:55:23.921
I can't get it out of my head.

1174
00:55:23.988 --> 00:55:25.856
even though I can't
sing it right.

1175
00:55:25.923 --> 00:55:29.026
It's a history of
rock 'n' roll in six verses.

1176
00:55:29.093 --> 00:55:31.028
and it's got
a beautiful chorus.

1177
00:55:31.095 --> 00:55:32.663
Now. believe it or not.
this is the first time

1178
00:55:32.730 --> 00:55:35.666
I've ever sung the song.

1179
00:55:35.733 --> 00:55:39.269
* Long. long time ago.
I can still remember *

1180
00:55:39.336 --> 00:55:41.939
* How that music used
to make me smile *

1181
00:55:42.006 --> 00:55:43.941
- The record label.
they weren't entirely

1182
00:55:44.008 --> 00:55:47.011
secure about Don at all.

1183
00:55:47.077 --> 00:55:51.449
At one point. the head
of A&R called me up and said.

1184
00:55:51.516 --> 00:55:53.017
"This guy is a no-talent."

1185
00:55:53.083 --> 00:55:54.919
Those were his exact words.

1186
00:55:54.985 --> 00:55:59.089
- * The day the music died *

1187
00:55:59.156 --> 00:56:00.324

I have the drummers

1188
00:56:00.391 --> 00:56:02.527
and everybody else coming
in here.

1189
00:56:02.593 --> 00:56:05.095
- We recorded in studio A

1190
00:56:05.162 --> 00:56:07.197
at the Record Plant
on 48th Street.

1191
00:56:09.199 --> 00:56:11.235
- We started to work together.

1192
00:56:11.301 --> 00:56:13.303
It was a contentious
relationship.

1193
00:56:15.272 --> 00:56:17.307
- We had some terrible
disagreements.

1194
00:56:17.374 --> 00:56:19.944
We used to stand
out in the hallway.

1195
00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:22.913
and I would start
conversations with.

1196
00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:24.982
"The trouble
with you is. Don..."

You know?

1198
00:56:27.351 --> 00:56:28.553
- Oh. well.
he didn't even want me

1199
00:56:28.619 --> 00:56:30.287
to play guitar on the record.

1200
00:56:30.354 --> 00:56:33.658
- But I did not appreciate
his rhythm guitar playing.

1201
00:56:33.724 --> 00:56:35.660
and originally
I wanted to replace it

1202
00:56:35.726 --> 00:56:37.462
with a studio guitarist.

1203
00:56:37.528 --> 00:56:40.765
- I said. well. I'm playing
guitar on the record. okay?

1204
00:56:43.167 --> 00:56:46.403
Here I was. coming into his
life as crazy as I could be.

1205
00:56:46.471 --> 00:56:48.305
He wasn't all
that sane either.

1206
00:56:48.372 --> 00:56:50.174
but at the same time.
he brought in wonderful

1207
00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:53.511
players and wrote
some beautiful strings.

1208
00:56:53.578 --> 00:56:54.879
He was very talented.

1209
00:56:57.314 --> 00:57:00.050
And so. I was being
constantly thrilled.

1210
00:57:00.117 --> 00:57:01.519
I had "Empty Chairs."

1211
00:57:01.586 --> 00:57:03.921
I had "Crossroads."
I had "Winter Wood."

1212
00:57:03.988 --> 00:57:07.157
I had the album.
but I didn't have the big one.

1213
00:57:07.224 --> 00:57:10.961
* Did you write
the book of love? *

1214
00:57:11.028 --> 00:57:13.163
* Do you have faith
in God above? *

1215
00:57:13.230 --> 00:57:15.633
- "American Pie."
we put together

1216
00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:17.401
in the rehearsal studio.

1217
00:57:17.468 --> 00:57:21.872
Don was not really comfortable
playing with a rhythm section.

1218
00:57:21.939 --> 00:57:24.174
What I did with Don
is I got him together

1219
00:57:24.241 --> 00:57:27.411
with a couple of players
who were very good.

1220
00:57:27.478 --> 00:57:30.781
but weren't hardcore
studio players.

1221
00:57:30.848 --> 00:57:33.584
and we rehearsed for two weeks.

1222
00:57:33.651 --> 00:57:38.055
- * Well. I know that you're
in love with him *

1223
00:57:38.122 --> 00:57:40.591
- It was just myself.
Don. Freeman.

1224
00:57:40.658 --> 00:57:43.027
and I believe.
the drummer. Roy Markowitz.

1225
00:57:43.093 --> 00:57:44.929
So it was just Don
and a rhythm section.

1226
00:57:44.995 --> 00:57:46.230
kind of bare bones.

1227
00:57:48.633 --> 00:57:51.368
- We started rehearsals.
This is a struggle.

1228
00:57:51.435 --> 00:57:54.572
In a way. "American Pie."
it kept sounding like a polka.

1229
00:57:54.639 --> 00:57:55.840
and it really annoyed me.

1230
00:57:55.906 --> 00:57:58.008
I said. this is really bad.

1231
00:58:01.011 --> 00:58:02.980
The day we're
recording "American Pie."

1232
00:58:03.047 --> 00:58:04.649
we still didn't have it right.

1233
00:58:04.715 --> 00:58:06.283
The groove. we don't have it.

1234
00:58:06.350 --> 00:58:08.719
To Ed Freeman's credit.
he would come up

1235
00:58:08.786 --> 00:58:11.155
with things that would
just save everything.

1236
00:58:11.221 --> 00:58:13.323
and he brings a young man

1237
00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:15.760
to the session
named Paul Griffin.

1238
00:58:15.826 --> 00:58:17.995
- We added the electric guitar

1239
00:58:18.062 --> 00:58:21.098
and Paul Griffin on piano
at the last minute.

1240
00:58:21.165 --> 00:58:23.167
I had worked
with Griffin before.

1241
00:58:23.233 --> 00:58:24.935
I knew he was the right guy.

1242
00:58:25.002 --> 00:58:26.503
[piano music]

1243
00:58:26.571 --> 00:58:29.106
- Griffin had never heard
the song in his life.

1244
00:58:29.173 --> 00:58:31.576
so here we are trying it
for the first time.

1245
00:58:31.642 --> 00:58:35.846
* *

1246
00:58:35.913 --> 00:58:37.948
- We stumbled
through a few takes.

1247
00:58:38.015 --> 00:58:39.850
Paul Griffin. he didn't
really know what to do

1248
00:58:39.917 --> 00:58:41.686
with the first verse.
and he was very nervous.

1249
00:58:41.752 --> 00:58:44.622
* *

1250
00:58:44.689 --> 00:58:48.993
- And they put my guitar
in his earphones.

1251
00:58:49.059 --> 00:58:52.429
[guitar riffing]

1252
00:58:52.496 --> 00:58:55.966
And I hit that thing hard.
and I play it loud.

1253
00:58:56.033 --> 00:58:59.570
And all of a sudden. Griffin.
he starts playing this thing.

1254
00:58:59.637 --> 00:59:02.707
[lively piano]

1255
00:59:02.773 --> 00:59:05.175
He's going. "Whoa!"
And he starts playing

1256
00:59:05.242 --> 00:59:07.311
the piano like
a gospel stride piano.

1257
00:59:07.377 --> 00:59:10.180
* *

1258
00:59:10.247 --> 00:59:12.216
He's just rolling and rocking

1259
00:59:12.282 --> 00:59:16.086
and kicking it here
and backing off there and.

1260
00:59:16.153 --> 00:59:17.755
you know.
just changing everything

1261
00:59:17.822 --> 00:59:21.058
as we're moving along and
building from verse to verse.

1262
00:59:23.127 --> 00:59:24.995
- Paul Griffin was the hero.

1263
00:59:25.062 --> 00:59:26.797
He was just an amazing cat.

1264
00:59:26.864 --> 00:59:28.899
Gospel. jazz. chops--

1265
00:59:28.966 --> 00:59:30.768
just such a monster.

1266
00:59:30.835 --> 00:59:33.738
- * Them good old boys were
drinking whiskey and rye *

1267
00:59:33.804 --> 00:59:36.641
I'm kicking his ass. you know.
and he's kicking my ass.

1268
00:59:36.707 --> 00:59:38.709
and the two of us together
making the drummer go

1269
00:59:38.776 --> 00:59:40.044
where he's supposed to go.

1270
00:59:40.110 --> 00:59:41.545
and everybody else falls
in line.

1271
00:59:43.513 --> 00:59:46.951
- The track was just.
like. so rocking. man.

1272
00:59:48.552 --> 00:59:50.087
- Well. I knew we were
where we were supposed to be.

1273
00:59:50.154 --> 00:59:52.456
It felt great.
It was jumping and.

1274
00:59:52.522 --> 00:59:54.024
you know.
it was what I wanted.

1275
00:59:54.091 --> 00:59:57.127
* Bye-bye. Miss American Pie *

1276
00:59:57.194 --> 01:00:00.497
- There was that one take
where it was just magic.

1277
01:00:00.564 --> 01:00:01.999
and it just happened.

1278
01:00:02.066 --> 01:00:04.434
- * Boys were drinking
whiskey and rye *

1279
01:00:04.501 --> 01:00:07.137
Paul Griffin. he came in
at the last moment.

1280
01:00:07.204 --> 01:00:10.675
and Hail Mary pass.
saved the whole dang thing.

1281
01:00:10.741 --> 01:00:12.476
I said. that's it!

1282
01:00:14.011 --> 01:00:17.247
- When they finished.
I just hit the talk back.

1283
01:00:17.314 --> 01:00:18.983
and I said.
"Y'all better come in here

1284
01:00:19.049 --> 01:00:20.184
and take a listen to this."

1285
01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:21.952
And everybody was high-fiving

1286
01:00:22.019 --> 01:00:23.921
each other and dancing around.

1287
01:00:23.988 --> 01:00:26.456
It was clear to everybody.

1288
01:00:26.523 --> 01:00:29.559
we all knew it was great.

1291
01:00:35.232 --> 01:00:38.669
Well. then we did the vocals.

1292
01:00:38.736 --> 01:00:41.739
- I sang the song probably
about 30 times.

1293
01:00:41.806 --> 01:00:45.910
singing things that were very
riffy. you know. high notes.

1294
01:00:45.976 --> 01:00:47.444
Ed didn't like that.

1295
01:00:48.946 --> 01:00:51.415
- We went to the mat
about that more than once.

1296
01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:55.185
What I ended up doing is
recording a lot of vocals

1297
01:00:55.252 --> 01:00:57.487
and then splicing together the
parts

1298
01:00:57.554 --> 01:00:58.956
that I considered iconic.

1299
01:00:59.023 --> 01:01:00.457
But we got it. in the end.

1300
01:01:00.524 --> 01:01:04.228
- Well. finally. we got
a coherent mix and vocal.

1301
01:01:04.294 --> 01:01:06.997
Everything was right.
and it was very good.

1302
01:01:07.064 --> 01:01:08.365
- I think the only thing

1303
01:01:08.432 --> 01:01:10.400
that we were in agreement
about.

1304
01:01:10.467 --> 01:01:13.337
is that we were
both fiercely committed

1305
01:01:13.403 --> 01:01:15.773
to this song being
a masterpiece.

1306
01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:17.407
We were not leaving the studio

1307
01:01:17.474 --> 01:01:20.110
until this thing
was brilliant.

1308
01:01:20.177 --> 01:01:22.713
and we didn't. and it is.

You have a right
to dream in the US.

01:01:38.628 --> 01:01:39.563
It's the American Dream.

1314
01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:45.870
RCA Studios is definitely
one of the most

been in my entire life.

and be singing that
in a comraderie way.

1325

extremely struck by that song.

1326

This thing about the melody
that feels completely timeless.

- Yeah. I'll give it a go.

I think I know the album cover

1332
01:02:27.211 --> 01:02:28.512

- Whatever that is.

Honestly. this song
is terrifying to cut.

I woke up this morning. had a
little panic attack about it.

1339
01:02:39.456 --> 01:02:41.892
I think she did too.
because it's such an iconic

song you've heard
a million times.

1341
01:02:43.493 --> 01:02:46.096
It is so ingrained in people's
mind.

1342
01:02:46.163 --> 01:02:48.365
and so to even dare touch it

1343
01:02:48.432 --> 01:02:50.567
or try to reinvent it
is pretty crazy.

1344
01:02:50.634 --> 01:02:56.874
- * A long. long time ago.
I can still remember *

1345
01:02:56.941 --> 01:03:02.512
* How that music used
to make me smile *

1346
01:03:02.579 --> 01:03:07.017
* And I knew
if I had my chance *

1347
01:03:07.084 --> 01:03:10.254
It made me feel sad when I was
singing the start of the song.

"Bye-bye. Miss American Pie."

incredible musicians.

1355
01:03:30.707 --> 01:03:32.409
and to be a part of that.
I feel. like.

1356
01:03:32.476 --> 01:03:34.078

* This'll be

There's a reason it's been
around for 50 years.

* Oh. did you write
the book of love? *

* And do you have faith
in God above? *

I heard "American Pie."

01:03:58.502 --> 01:04:00.370
it must have been in '76.

01:04:00.437 --> 01:04:03.207
It was a song that drew you in
deeply.

1367
01:04:03.273 --> 01:04:06.310
- * Real slow *

1368
01:04:06.376 --> 01:04:08.645
- Everybody can relate
to that song.

1369
01:04:08.712 --> 01:04:11.348
"American Pie" crossed
generations

1370
01:04:11.415 --> 01:04:14.218
and is still resonating
with people today.

1371
01:04:14.284 --> 01:04:17.554
- * You both kicked off
your shoes *

1372
01:04:17.621 --> 01:04:21.691
* Man. I dig those
rhythm and blues. oh *

1373
01:04:21.758 --> 01:04:24.794
- With the turmoil
that's still going on.

1374
01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:26.931
that song is still
very up-to-date.

1375
01:04:26.997 --> 01:04:28.465
I mean. it's just magical.

1376
01:04:28.532 --> 01:04:32.736
- * But I knew I was
out of luck the day *

1377
01:04:32.802 --> 01:04:34.939
- When I listen
to "American Pie."

1378
01:04:35.005 --> 01:04:37.874
it just reminds me
of what America means to me.

1379
01:04:37.942 --> 01:04:39.509
America means freedom.

1380
01:04:39.576 --> 01:04:42.812
- * Bye-bye.
Miss American Pie *

1381
01:04:42.879 --> 01:04:45.015
* Drove my Chevy
to the levee *

1382
01:04:45.082 --> 01:04:47.617
* But the levee was dry *

1383
01:04:47.684 --> 01:04:49.653
- I think the song
"American Pie" has just always

1384
01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:51.555
echoed through
the United States' history.

1385
01:04:51.621 --> 01:04:53.757
It's almost like
a national anthem of sorts

1386
01:04:53.823 --> 01:04:55.192
to a lot of people.

1387
01:04:55.259 --> 01:04:58.662
- * This'll be the day
that I die *

1388
01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:01.565
"Newsweek" magazine came out
with this big article

1389
01:05:01.631 --> 01:05:04.668
about the top ten dying cities
in the United States.

1390
01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:07.371
My hometown. Grand Rapids.
Michigan. was one of them.

1391
01:05:07.437 --> 01:05:08.772
and we were like.
you know what.

1392
01:05:08.838 --> 01:05:11.075
we need to strike back
against this.

1393
01:05:11.141 --> 01:05:14.411
- * When the jester sang
for the king and queen *

1394
01:05:14.478 --> 01:05:16.380
- We were like.
let's make this lip dub video

1395
01:05:16.446 --> 01:05:17.948
and just pack it full
of everyone

1396
01:05:18.015 --> 01:05:20.117
with all the energy
and fight back

1397
01:05:20.184 --> 01:05:21.418
and say. this is who we are.

1398
01:05:23.587 --> 01:05:26.090
The track that I chose.
"American Pie."

1399
01:05:26.156 --> 01:05:29.159
it felt so full of Americana

1400
01:05:29.226 --> 01:05:31.495
and this hope for the future.

1401
01:05:31.561 --> 01:05:33.597
and it felt representative
of the city

1402
01:05:33.663 --> 01:05:34.731
and what we were trying to do.

1403
01:05:34.798 --> 01:05:37.934
- * No verdict was returned *

1404
01:05:38.002 --> 01:05:42.572
- We loved it
because it spoke to dark times

1405
01:05:42.639 --> 01:05:45.642
in our country's history.
as well as to our hope

1406
01:05:45.709 --> 01:05:47.744
that we could change it
and that we could

1407
01:05:47.811 --> 01:05:49.579
uplift ourselves
to a higher place.

1408
01:05:49.646 --> 01:05:52.049
- * The music died *

1409
01:05:52.116 --> 01:05:54.551
- Grand Rapids. Michigan was
"American Pie."

1410
01:05:54.618 --> 01:05:57.354
- * Bye-bye.
Miss American Pie *

1411
01:05:57.421 --> 01:05:58.655
- All of these
people singing it

1412
01:05:58.722 --> 01:06:00.524
out in the streets together.

1413
01:06:00.590 --> 01:06:02.726
they associated
with that song.

1414
01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:04.728
and they knew that it meant
something

1415
01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:08.098
and that it did represent
what this town was about.

1416
01:06:08.165 --> 01:06:11.468
the all-American story
that we still idealize.

1417
01:06:11.535 --> 01:06:13.237
that we still want to be true.

1418
01:06:13.303 --> 01:06:15.572
- * The day *

1419
01:06:15.639 --> 01:06:22.712
* The music died *

1420
01:06:24.348 --> 01:06:27.284
[funky music]

1421
01:06:27.351 --> 01:06:29.853
* *

1422
01:06:29.919 --> 01:06:32.856
- "American Pie" really hit
the nail on the head.

1423
01:06:32.922 --> 01:06:34.924
The record company.
they loved it

1424
01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:38.628
and sent me over to a man
named George Whiteman.

1425
01:06:38.695 --> 01:06:41.131
who was
a fashion photographer.

1426
01:06:41.198 --> 01:06:44.734
and he had a big studio
and long-legged ladies were

1427
01:06:44.801 --> 01:06:47.137
coming in and kissing Georgie.
"Oh. Georgie."

1428
01:06:47.204 --> 01:06:49.173
He says. "Hi Don. you know.
I heard the record.

1429
01:06:49.239 --> 01:06:52.509
Great record. Come on inside.
I'm gonna paint your thumb."

1430
01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:55.612
So he painted my thumb.

1431
01:06:55.679 --> 01:06:58.115
and then I looked
down the guitar.

1432
01:06:58.182 --> 01:07:00.350
And the thing is that
there are children's

1433
01:07:00.417 --> 01:07:02.752
nursery rhymes
in "American Pie."

1434
01:07:02.819 --> 01:07:04.788
You know. "Jack be nimble.
Jack be quick."

1435
01:07:04.854 --> 01:07:06.490
So he went one step further--

1436
01:07:06.556 --> 01:07:08.392
"Little Jack Horner sat
in the corner.

1437
01:07:08.458 --> 01:07:10.327
"eating his Christmas pie.

1438
01:07:10.394 --> 01:07:11.628
put in his thumb
and pulled out a plum.

1439
01:07:11.695 --> 01:07:13.563
and said.
what a good boy am I."

1440
01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:16.366
That's not in the song.
but the implication is that.

1441
01:07:16.433 --> 01:07:18.335
you now.
it's another nursery rhyme.

1442
01:07:18.402 --> 01:07:20.137
I said.
absolutely right. perfect.

1443
01:07:20.204 --> 01:07:22.539
I would have never thought
of it in 100 million years.

1444
01:07:22.606 --> 01:07:25.342
[stirring music]

1445
01:07:25.409 --> 01:07:28.245
And then. about two weeks
later. we get the word

1446
01:07:28.312 --> 01:07:32.349
that United Artists is
buying Media Arts Records.

1447
01:07:34.618 --> 01:07:36.920
Mainly because
they love "American Pie."

1448
01:07:36.986 --> 01:07:39.156
They think it's a hit record
and a hit album.

1449
01:07:39.223 --> 01:07:40.357
and they're all excited.

1450
01:07:40.424 --> 01:07:47.131
* *

1451
01:07:47.197 --> 01:07:48.932
Everything took off
like a rocket.

1452
01:07:48.998 --> 01:07:51.768
* Bye-bye.
Miss American Pie *

1453
01:07:51.835 --> 01:07:54.171
* Drove my Chevy to the levee *

1454
01:07:54.238 --> 01:07:55.805
* But the levee was dry *

1455
01:07:55.872 --> 01:07:59.776
- It went from zero
to number one so fast.

1456
01:07:59.843 --> 01:08:02.912
- * This'll the day
that I die *

1457
01:08:02.979 --> 01:08:05.715
* This'll be the day
that I die *

1458
01:08:05.782 --> 01:08:07.684
"American Pie" blew up
the world.

1459
01:08:07.751 --> 01:08:11.455
* Now. for ten years
we've been on our own *

1460
01:08:11.521 --> 01:08:13.190
* And moss grows fat *

1461
01:08:13.257 --> 01:08:16.260
- The album and the single
became number one.

1462
01:08:16.326 --> 01:08:19.028
and it stayed up there
for weeks and weeks.

1463
01:08:20.564 --> 01:08:22.666
- It was the longest
hit record

1464
01:08:22.732 --> 01:08:24.168
that had ever been released.

1465
01:08:24.234 --> 01:08:27.036
- Three minutes was the limit
to any song.

1466
01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:29.539
but "American Pie" just
broke that rule.

1467
01:08:29.606 --> 01:08:32.008
It was just
a complete phenomenon.

1468
01:08:33.777 --> 01:08:35.545
- People heard the short
version of the song

1469
01:08:35.612 --> 01:08:38.047
on the radio. and they heard
the long version on the album.

1470
01:08:38.114 --> 01:08:40.417
and they called up all
the radio stations and said.

1471
01:08:40.484 --> 01:08:41.651
we want to hear
the whole thing

1472
01:08:41.718 --> 01:08:43.220
when you play the top 40.

1473
01:08:43.287 --> 01:08:44.954
So now they all had
to make decisions.

1474
01:08:45.021 --> 01:08:46.623
do we play
this one guy's song?

1475
01:08:46.690 --> 01:08:48.392
We've got to give him
8.5 minutes?

1476
01:08:48.458 --> 01:08:49.993
But they did it.
played it off the album.

1477
01:08:50.059 --> 01:08:52.962
- * Bye-bye.
Miss American Pie *

1478
01:08:53.029 --> 01:08:54.864
- There was a radio station.
I remember.

1479
01:08:54.931 --> 01:08:56.766
in New York that played it
over and over.

1480
01:08:56.833 --> 01:09:00.804
end to end with nothing else
for eight hours in a row.

1481
01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:03.207
- * This'll be the day
that I die *

1482
01:09:03.273 --> 01:09:04.508
- It was just unheard of.

1483
01:09:04.574 --> 01:09:06.643
- * This'll be the day
that I die *

1484
01:09:06.710 --> 01:09:08.578
So I'm thinking.

1485
01:09:08.645 --> 01:09:11.047
this is amazing.
and I'm loving it.

1486
01:09:12.649 --> 01:09:14.284
There's never been
a phenomenon

1487
01:09:14.351 --> 01:09:15.485
like "American Pie."

1488
01:09:15.552 --> 01:09:16.786
I was smiled on.

1489
01:09:16.853 --> 01:09:19.189
I was as surprised as anybody

1490
01:09:19.256 --> 01:09:20.924
that I could make magic.

1491
01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:23.927
[dreamy music]

1492
01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:25.695
* *

1493
01:09:25.762 --> 01:09:27.130
- The more I listened to it.

1494
01:09:27.197 --> 01:09:30.734
I thought. wow.
this is like an epic.

1495
01:09:39.343 --> 01:09:42.646
"American Pie" was
really encapsulating

1496
01:09:42.712 --> 01:09:44.581
the experience
of a whole generation.

1497
01:09:44.648 --> 01:09:47.083
We were witness to the death

1498
01:09:47.150 --> 01:09:49.319
of the American dream.

1499
01:09:49.386 --> 01:09:52.422
We went through
both Kennedys being shot.

1500
01:09:52.489 --> 01:09:54.924
Malcolm X. Martin Luther King.

1501
01:09:54.991 --> 01:09:57.694
Vietnam. you know.
hippies thought we were gonna

1502
01:09:57.761 --> 01:10:00.096
take over the world
with love and peace...

1503
01:10:02.399 --> 01:10:04.668
And it didn't happen.

1504
01:10:04.734 --> 01:10:07.537
For me.
"American Pie" is the eulogy

1505
01:10:07.604 --> 01:10:11.641
for a dream
that didn't take place.

1506
01:10:13.109 --> 01:10:15.445
It was real important
that way.

1507
01:10:15.512 --> 01:10:17.614
I think we all needed it.

1508
01:10:17.681 --> 01:10:20.484
It was an acknowledgement
of what we had been through.

1509
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:24.187
and in a way. because it was
an acknowledgement.

1510
01:10:24.254 --> 01:10:25.955
we could move on.

1511
01:10:27.391 --> 01:10:30.327
[stirring music]

1512
01:10:30.394 --> 01:10:37.534
* *

1513
01:10:40.604 --> 01:10:44.841
- Here we go. Don McLean.
Take two. mark.

1514
01:10:44.908 --> 01:10:46.510
- I feel like I want
to talk about the actual

1515
01:10:46.576 --> 01:10:48.044
writing of the song.

1516
01:10:48.111 --> 01:10:49.546
- Okay.

1517
01:10:49.613 --> 01:10:52.616
I'm trying to do
a kaleidoscopic.

1518
01:10:52.682 --> 01:10:56.520
dream-like. impressionistic.

1519
01:10:56.586 --> 01:10:58.955
yet understandable thing.

1520
01:10:59.022 --> 01:11:03.660
The first verse
of the song is biographical.

1521
01:11:03.727 --> 01:11:06.029
* Long. long time ago *

1522
01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:08.498
* I can still remember
how that music *

1523
01:11:08.565 --> 01:11:10.934
* Used to make me smile *

1524
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.969
Buddy was like a lost brother

1525
01:11:13.036 --> 01:11:15.905
or somebody that died
in the war or--

1526
01:11:15.972 --> 01:11:19.743
there was this yearning
I had in me always.

1527
01:11:19.809 --> 01:11:22.245
and I could never talk
to anybody about it.

1528
01:11:22.312 --> 01:11:24.548
because it was just all in me.

1529
01:11:24.614 --> 01:11:29.152
* The day the music died *

1530
01:11:29.218 --> 01:11:31.254
So let's see now.
the second verse--

1531
01:11:31.321 --> 01:11:32.288
how's it go?

1532
01:11:32.356 --> 01:11:33.890
Do you remember?
[laughs]

1533
01:11:33.957 --> 01:11:37.761
* Now do you believe
in rock 'n' roll? *

1534
01:11:37.827 --> 01:11:41.998
* Can music save
your mortal soul? *

1535
01:11:42.065 --> 01:11:45.335
"Can music save
your mortal soul?"

1536
01:11:45.402 --> 01:11:48.304
See. that's the theology
in me coming out.

1537
01:11:48.372 --> 01:11:51.307
In the church. they only talk
about your immortal soul.

1538
01:11:51.375 --> 01:11:54.578
I'm saying. can music save
your mortal soul.

1539
01:11:54.644 --> 01:11:57.313
as a man. now. being alive?

1540
01:11:57.381 --> 01:11:59.416
* Well. I know
that you're in *

1541
01:11:59.483 --> 01:12:01.184
"Well. I know that you're
in love with him

1542
01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:03.620
"'cause I saw you dancing
in the gym.

1543
01:12:03.687 --> 01:12:05.889
You both kicked off
your shoes."

1544
01:12:05.955 --> 01:12:07.223
* You both kicked off
your shoes *

1545
01:12:07.290 --> 01:12:09.926
"Man. I dig those
rhythm and blues."

1546
01:12:09.993 --> 01:12:11.595
So this is all me.
little old me.

1547
01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:14.464
seeing other kids being happy

1548
01:12:14.531 --> 01:12:17.367
and hearing the music
going on behind them.

1549
01:12:17.434 --> 01:12:21.971
and seeing other things happen
that I wasn't a part of.

1550
01:12:22.038 --> 01:12:25.241
"Yeah. I was a lonely
teenage broncin' buck."

1551
01:12:25.308 --> 01:12:28.878
Now. that's a take off
on having bronchial asthma.

1552
01:12:28.945 --> 01:12:30.980
I was "bronching."
but I was still a stallion.

1553
01:12:31.047 --> 01:12:32.348
you know what I mean?

1554
01:12:32.416 --> 01:12:35.485
* I was a lonely
teenage broncin' buck *

1555
01:12:35.552 --> 01:12:37.387
"With a pink carnation..."

1556
01:12:37.454 --> 01:12:40.289
* And a pickup truck.
but I knew I *

1557
01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:42.058
Sure. I went
to a lot of proms.

1558
01:12:42.125 --> 01:12:43.893
but I never had a pickup truck.

1559
01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:46.362
but I could have anything
I wanted in my songs.

1560
01:12:49.065 --> 01:12:52.268
Since my father died.
I have no family.

1561
01:12:52.335 --> 01:12:54.638
You know. I have my mother.
but my mother

1562
01:12:54.704 --> 01:12:56.473
and I went sort of
different ways.

1563
01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:59.008
* Oh. for ten years
we've been on our own *

1564
01:12:59.075 --> 01:13:00.744
That's me talking.
"For ten years I've been

1565
01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:02.245
"on my own.

1566
01:13:02.311 --> 01:13:04.047
Moss grows fat
on a rolling stone."

1567
01:13:04.113 --> 01:13:05.248
I think I was
putting on weight.

1568
01:13:05.314 --> 01:13:06.716
I thought I was.
you know. getting fat

1569
01:13:06.783 --> 01:13:08.284
and lazy and stuff.

1570
01:13:08.351 --> 01:13:11.120
* When the jester sang
for the king and queen *

1571
01:13:11.187 --> 01:13:13.322
"When the jester sang
for the king and queen."

1572
01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:15.659
Now. there's been
this discussion

1573
01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:17.561
about the jester
over and over.

1574
01:13:17.627 --> 01:13:20.897
You know. I certainly would
have mentioned Dylan's name

1575
01:13:20.964 --> 01:13:22.298
if I had meant to mention him.

1576
01:13:22.365 --> 01:13:24.333
I would have said Bob
or something else.

1577
01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.302
but I didn't.
'cause it ain't him.

1578
01:13:26.369 --> 01:13:31.007
The king. I say. "The jester
stole his thorny crown."

1579
01:13:31.074 --> 01:13:33.142
I didn't
mention Elvis Presley.

1580
01:13:33.209 --> 01:13:35.545
because Elvis did not
have a thorny crown.

1581
01:13:35.612 --> 01:13:38.081
Jesus Christ has
a thorny crown.

1582
01:13:38.147 --> 01:13:41.017
If I'd wanted to say Elvis
instead of the King.

1583
01:13:41.084 --> 01:13:42.852
I would have said Elvis.

1584
01:13:42.919 --> 01:13:45.054
I say James Dean in the song.

1585
01:13:45.121 --> 01:13:49.292
So what you have is this
mythology that I'm inventing

1586
01:13:49.358 --> 01:13:52.929
of this insulting.
happy jester.

1587
01:13:52.996 --> 01:13:56.500
Oh. I'll just grab
the king's crown off his head

1588
01:13:56.566 --> 01:13:58.301
and see if he laughs at that.

1589
01:13:58.367 --> 01:13:59.669
see if that's funny.

1590
01:13:59.736 --> 01:14:04.007
* And while Lennon read
a book on Marx *

1591
01:14:04.073 --> 01:14:06.175
"And Lennon read
a book on Marx."

1592
01:14:06.242 --> 01:14:09.546
Well. that applies to both
John Lennon and the real Lenin.

1593
01:14:09.613 --> 01:14:11.180
[chuckles]

1594
01:14:11.247 --> 01:14:13.416
Communism radicalized
John Lennon.

1595
01:14:13.483 --> 01:14:16.252
and Lenin was radicalized
by Marx.

1596
01:14:18.622 --> 01:14:20.089
So now the next verse is...

1597
01:14:20.156 --> 01:14:23.259
* Helter-skelter
in the summer swelter *

1598
01:14:23.326 --> 01:14:26.963
"Eight miles high" definitely
came from the name of a song.

1599
01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:30.299
* Eight miles high
and falling fast *

1600
01:14:30.366 --> 01:14:31.735
I thought that
was a great song.

1601
01:14:31.801 --> 01:14:34.638
The "eight miles high" idea.
I loved that.

1602
01:14:34.704 --> 01:14:38.708
Now. there was a song
that Josh White used to sing

1603
01:14:38.775 --> 01:14:40.777
called "Bottle Up and Go."

1604
01:14:40.844 --> 01:14:44.480
* There I am in the grass *

1605
01:14:44.548 --> 01:14:46.783
* Mm-mmm a forward pass *

1606
01:14:46.850 --> 01:14:49.318
* You got to bottle up and go *

1607
01:14:49.385 --> 01:14:52.822
So that was the idea
of a forward pass in the grass.

1608
01:14:52.889 --> 01:14:56.492
* The grass. the players tried
for a forward pass *

1609
01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:59.763
"With a jester
on the sidelines."

1610
01:14:59.829 --> 01:15:01.665
That meant.
this wasn't funny anymore.

1611
01:15:01.731 --> 01:15:03.332
This wasn't funny at all.

1612
01:15:03.399 --> 01:15:06.302
* The halftime air was
sweet perfume *

1613
01:15:06.369 --> 01:15:09.739
* While the sergeants played
a marching tune *

1614
01:15:09.806 --> 01:15:13.209
And then the rest of the lyric
is about the people trying

1615
01:15:13.276 --> 01:15:15.411
to take over.
and they would be pushed back

1616
01:15:15.478 --> 01:15:19.215
by the marching band. the
military-industrial complex.

1617
01:15:19.282 --> 01:15:22.451
* The marching band refused
to yield *

1618
01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:24.821
I was always marching
against the war in Vietnam.

1619
01:15:24.888 --> 01:15:27.957
We were constantly
being pushed aside

1620
01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:31.995
in this relentless desire
to destroy Southeast Asia.

1621
01:15:32.061 --> 01:15:35.098
* There we were
all in one place *

1622
01:15:35.164 --> 01:15:38.301
"The generation lost
in space."

1623
01:15:38.367 --> 01:15:42.672
We're out in the middle
of an endless universe.

1624
01:15:42.739 --> 01:15:46.810
None of us are important
except to each other.

1625
01:15:46.876 --> 01:15:48.645
and we're all lost in space.

1626
01:15:48.712 --> 01:15:52.315
because the war was hotter
than it ever was before.

1627
01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:55.051
* I met a girl
who sang the blues *

1628
01:15:55.118 --> 01:15:58.121
* And I asked her
for some happy news *

1629
01:15:58.187 --> 01:16:00.056
"I met a girl
who sang the blues.

1630
01:16:00.123 --> 01:16:01.557
I asked her
for some happy news."

1631
01:16:01.625 --> 01:16:03.793
Well. you see.
I'd gotten the bad news

1632
01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:05.028
in the front of the song.

1633
01:16:05.094 --> 01:16:06.896
Now I'm asking her
for some happy news

1634
01:16:06.963 --> 01:16:08.765
at the end of the song.

1635
01:16:08.832 --> 01:16:12.135
* But she just smiled
and turned away *

1636
01:16:12.201 --> 01:16:13.770
And you know how it is
when a woman

1637
01:16:13.837 --> 01:16:17.506
or anybody smile
and turn away like that?

1638
01:16:17.573 --> 01:16:20.877
She knew something. but
she wasn't gonna say anything.

1639
01:16:20.944 --> 01:16:23.012
She doesn't give me good news.

1640
01:16:23.079 --> 01:16:25.715
* And I went down
to the sacred store *

1641
01:16:25.782 --> 01:16:28.985
* Where I'd heard the music
years before *

1642
01:16:29.052 --> 01:16:31.054
"Went down
to the sacred store."

1643
01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:33.256
Now I'm going back
to New Rochelle.

1644
01:16:33.322 --> 01:16:36.159
They said. "The music doesn't
play anymore. Don."

1645
01:16:36.225 --> 01:16:38.327
The country was headed
in the wrong direction.

1646
01:16:38.394 --> 01:16:41.564
toward an evil god
of some sort.

1647
01:16:41.631 --> 01:16:43.466
and that's how the song ends.

1648
01:16:43.532 --> 01:16:45.802
* And the three men
I admire most *

1649
01:16:45.869 --> 01:16:48.104
* The Father. Son.
and the Holy Ghost *

1650
01:16:48.171 --> 01:16:50.439
"The three men I admire most.

1651
01:16:50.506 --> 01:16:53.376
caught the last train
for the coast."

1652
01:16:53.442 --> 01:16:57.446
so even God has been corrupted.

1653
01:16:57.513 --> 01:17:01.484
He's going to Los Angeles.
[laughs]

1654
01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:04.453
[bombastic music]

1655
01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:10.526
* *

1656
01:17:10.593 --> 01:17:15.231
- "A long. long time ago lived
a lonely newspaper boy."

1657
01:17:15.298 --> 01:17:16.632
I'm Peter Gallagher.

1658
01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:19.168
I'm an actor and singer.

1659
01:17:19.235 --> 01:17:21.671
I'm here to read an audiobook

1660
01:17:21.738 --> 01:17:23.907
all inspired by Don McLean's

1661
01:17:23.973 --> 01:17:26.209
epic. "American Pie."

1662
01:17:26.275 --> 01:17:28.845
"He never missed a porch
or a sidewalk

1663
01:17:28.912 --> 01:17:30.980
with his finely crafted fling."

1664
01:17:31.047 --> 01:17:33.216
What this song
and this story provides

1665
01:17:33.282 --> 01:17:35.919
all of us is the chance
for us to recognize

1666
01:17:35.985 --> 01:17:39.088
what we share
in terms of the past.

1667
01:17:39.155 --> 01:17:42.591
"His bike transformed
into a stealthy steed."

1668
01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:44.894
It's just a whole world
in there.

1669
01:17:44.961 --> 01:17:46.562
and you can hear and see in it

1670
01:17:46.629 --> 01:17:50.399
what you need to hear
and see in any given moment.

1671
01:17:50.466 --> 01:17:53.970
"The newspaper boy gently
picked up the guitar

1672
01:17:54.037 --> 01:17:55.805
and slung it
over his shoulder."

1673
01:17:55.872 --> 01:17:58.975
I was eager to contribute
to something

1674
01:17:59.042 --> 01:18:01.978
that might make people feel
connected again.

1675
01:18:02.045 --> 01:18:06.615
"Something had touched him
deep inside."

1676
01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:07.917
- * We started singin' *

1677
01:18:07.984 --> 01:18:10.754
* My. my.
this here Anakin guy *

1678
01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:12.488
* May be Vader someday later.

1679
01:18:12.555 --> 01:18:14.257
* Now he's just a small fry *

1680
01:18:14.323 --> 01:18:17.460
Well. in 1999 when "Star Wars"
was coming out

1681
01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:19.162
with the "Phantom Menace."
so I knew I wanted

1682
01:18:19.228 --> 01:18:22.231
to write a song parody
about "Star Wars."

1683
01:18:22.298 --> 01:18:24.700
And I flashed on the idea
of using "American Pie."

1684
01:18:24.768 --> 01:18:27.003
because it's one of my
all-time favorite songs.

1685
01:18:27.070 --> 01:18:29.438
* We finally got to Coruscant *

1686
01:18:29.505 --> 01:18:31.574
I think "American Pie"
is eternal.

1687
01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:34.377
There's some magic
baked into that song.

1688
01:18:34.443 --> 01:18:36.412
* How good the boy could be *

1689
01:18:36.479 --> 01:18:38.314
* *

1690
01:18:38.381 --> 01:18:39.983
When "The Saga Begins"
came out.

1691
01:18:40.049 --> 01:18:41.985
it was a huge hit
on Radio Disney.

1692
01:18:42.051 --> 01:18:43.987
so a lot of pre-teens were
listening to the song.

1693
01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:45.454
They didn't
know "American Pie."

1694
01:18:45.521 --> 01:18:46.589
they just thought.
oh. it's a funny Weird Al

1695
01:18:46.655 --> 01:18:47.991
song about "Star Wars."

1696
01:18:48.057 --> 01:18:51.727
The following year.
Madonna did a cover version

1697
01:18:51.795 --> 01:18:54.030
of "American Pie."
like. kind of a disco version.

1698
01:18:54.097 --> 01:18:56.732
and all these
kids were thinking.

1699
01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:00.369
how come Madonna is doing
an unfunny version

1700
01:19:00.436 --> 01:19:02.671
of a Weird Al song?
[laughs]

1701
01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:05.641
- [singing in Spanish]

1702
01:19:05.708 --> 01:19:12.615

1703
01:19:15.351 --> 01:19:17.020
- I remember
when you called me.

1704
01:19:17.086 --> 01:19:18.888
"Hey. doing the remake

1705
01:19:18.955 --> 01:19:20.723
"of 'American Pie.'

1706
01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:23.059
our version.
putting Spanish in it."

1707
01:19:23.126 --> 01:19:24.828
I was like. man.
are you kidding me?

1708
01:19:24.894 --> 01:19:26.762
What an honor. no-brainer.

1709
01:19:26.830 --> 01:19:29.698
- I mean. it's such a classic.
- It's just so powerful.

1710
01:19:29.765 --> 01:19:33.069
[singing in Spanish]

1711
01:19:40.309 --> 01:19:42.478
- Jencarlos.
he really understood

1712
01:19:42.545 --> 01:19:45.481
how to. someway.
say the same story

1713
01:19:45.548 --> 01:19:47.783
of the original song.
but in Spanish.

1714
01:19:50.753 --> 01:19:52.755
I knew about the song
since I was like 12.

1715
01:19:52.822 --> 01:19:54.157
My dad had it.

1716
01:19:54.223 --> 01:19:56.659
It's such an impactful song.

1717
01:19:56.725 --> 01:19:59.595
- [singing in Spanish]

1718
01:19:59.662 --> 01:20:04.433
* Again. bye-bye.
Miss American Pie *

1719
01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:06.269
- You know how many times
growing up that song played?

1720
01:20:06.335 --> 01:20:10.406
- I've been singing this song
as a fan for so many years.

1721
01:20:10.473 --> 01:20:12.241
* Them good old boys *

1722
01:20:12.308 --> 01:20:14.944
I see it as us.
from our culture.

1723
01:20:15.011 --> 01:20:16.946
tipping our hats off
to the original.

1724
01:20:17.013 --> 01:20:19.548
* The day that I die *

1725
01:20:19.615 --> 01:20:22.919
Still. to date.
that song has transcended.

1726
01:20:22.986 --> 01:20:25.088
It's still so inspiring.

1727
01:20:25.154 --> 01:20:26.923
What a masterpiece.

1728
01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:30.626
- * And there we were
all in one place *

1729
01:20:30.693 --> 01:20:34.563
* A generation lost in space *

1730
01:20:34.630 --> 01:20:36.599
When I first heard
"American Pie." I said.

1731
01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:38.301
hey. what is this
new record I'm listening to?

1732
01:20:38.367 --> 01:20:40.136
You know.
and I listened and listened.

1733
01:20:40.203 --> 01:20:43.072
and I was so blown away because
he takes you on a journey.

1734
01:20:43.139 --> 01:20:45.541
It's like.
each verse is different.

1735
01:20:45.608 --> 01:20:47.143
he goes
through different phases.

1736
01:20:47.210 --> 01:20:48.811
I love the melody.

1737
01:20:48.878 --> 01:20:50.746
and of course.
Don's lyrics are really great.

1738
01:20:50.813 --> 01:20:53.482
* You both kicked
off your shoes *

1739
01:20:53.549 --> 01:20:55.551
"We both kicked off our shoes.

1740
01:20:55.618 --> 01:20:57.586
and I dig those
rhythm and blues."

1741
01:20:57.653 --> 01:21:01.724
* As the flames climbed high
into the night *

1742
01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:03.859
Don. well. he's up there
with the best of them.

1743
01:21:03.927 --> 01:21:06.996
He's just a very.
very talented songwriter.

1744
01:21:07.063 --> 01:21:09.265
and he deserves his success.

1745
01:21:09.332 --> 01:21:10.934
Thank you.

1746
01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.936
[cheering]

1747
01:21:13.002 --> 01:21:16.940
all: * We were singin'
"Bye-bye. Miss American Pie" *

1748
01:21:17.006 --> 01:21:18.241
- I was doing a TV show

1749
01:21:18.307 --> 01:21:19.875
called "Zoey's
Extraordinary Playlist."

1750
01:21:19.943 --> 01:21:21.444
and after my character dies.

1751
01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:24.047
the entire cast sing
"American Pie."

1752
01:21:24.113 --> 01:21:27.316
all: * Singing. this'll be
the day that I die *

1753
01:21:27.383 --> 01:21:29.418
- It was amazing to see just

1754
01:21:29.485 --> 01:21:32.421
how powerful
that song is. still.

1755
01:21:32.488 --> 01:21:33.689
It really is timeless.

1756
01:21:33.756 --> 01:21:37.493
- * I met a girl
who sang the blues *

1757
01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:39.162
- "Zoey's" was a show
that I was

1758
01:21:39.228 --> 01:21:41.931
executive music producer for
and produced a lot of songs.

1759
01:21:41.998 --> 01:21:44.867
none better or bigger
than "American Pie"

1760
01:21:44.934 --> 01:21:46.169
for the finale of the season.

1761
01:21:46.235 --> 01:21:49.005
- * I went down
to the sacred store *

1762
01:21:49.072 --> 01:21:50.406
* Where I'd heard the music *

1763
01:21:50.473 --> 01:21:52.475
- As a songwriter.
it's the kind of song

1764
01:21:52.541 --> 01:21:54.410
you dream about writing.
that has meaning

1765
01:21:54.477 --> 01:21:56.412
and has depth. has relevance.

1766
01:21:56.479 --> 01:21:58.714
and is something
that continues to be relevant

1767
01:21:58.781 --> 01:22:00.916
to generations.
you know. ongoing.

1768
01:22:00.984 --> 01:22:04.487
- * In the streets.
the children screamed *

1769
01:22:04.553 --> 01:22:08.958
* The lovers cried
and the poets dreamed *

1770
01:22:09.025 --> 01:22:10.960
"American Pie" has always been
a part of my life.

1771
01:22:11.027 --> 01:22:13.262
You know. when my dad drove me
to preschool.

1772
01:22:13.329 --> 01:22:14.763
we were listening to it.

1773
01:22:14.830 --> 01:22:17.033
My dad wanted me to know
the history of that song.

1774
01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:18.067
because it's important.

1775
01:22:18.134 --> 01:22:20.269
It's heavy.
It's meaningful.

1776
01:22:20.336 --> 01:22:23.939
* And the three men
I admire the most *

1777
01:22:24.007 --> 01:22:26.742
There's a world that's
created with this song

1778
01:22:26.809 --> 01:22:29.112
that is our world.
but also isn't.

1779
01:22:29.178 --> 01:22:32.315
It's more tragic
and it's more beautiful.

1780
01:22:32.381 --> 01:22:34.583
* The day *

1781
01:22:34.650 --> 01:22:40.289
* The music died *

1782
01:22:40.356 --> 01:22:43.292
[stirring music]

1783
01:22:43.359 --> 01:22:50.499
* *

1784
01:23:19.695 --> 01:23:22.531
- Don. my name's Jeff Nicholas.
I'm president of the Surf.

1785
01:23:22.598 --> 01:23:24.700
I want to welcome you
to the Surf Ballroom.

1786
01:23:24.767 --> 01:23:26.269
- Pleasure to be here.
- I'd like to

1787
01:23:26.335 --> 01:23:27.370
show you the ballroom
a little bit.

1788
01:23:27.436 --> 01:23:28.837
- Definitely.
- Yeah.

1789
01:23:28.904 --> 01:23:31.840
So the ballroom was designed
to simulate walking out

1790
01:23:31.907 --> 01:23:37.213
on the beach and dancing
under the deep blue sky.

1791
01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:38.481
We kind of consider it

1792
01:23:38.547 --> 01:23:40.716
the soundstage
of American music.

1793
01:23:40.783 --> 01:23:43.552
- Well. it's certainly
an important place.

1794
01:23:43.619 --> 01:23:46.489
- * American boy *
- * American boy *

1795
01:23:46.555 --> 01:23:50.693
- * Invented rock 'n' roll *
- * Rock 'n' roll *

1796
01:23:50.759 --> 01:23:53.262
- All that stuff
from the late '40s

1797
01:23:53.329 --> 01:23:55.631
right on through
to the mid '60s.

1798
01:23:55.698 --> 01:23:58.634
that music is the essence
of everything.

1799
01:23:58.701 --> 01:24:01.237
- * They caused a sensation *

1800
01:24:01.304 --> 01:24:04.873
- So here we are. walking
on the stage of American music.

1801
01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:08.377
- * Shook up the nation *
- * American boy *

1802
01:24:08.444 --> 01:24:10.713
- The original stage ended
right here.

1803
01:24:10.779 --> 01:24:12.315
- So you mean Buddy would
be standing here?

1804
01:24:12.381 --> 01:24:15.851
- Buddy would have stood here.
Waylon would have stood here.

1805
01:24:15.918 --> 01:24:17.986
and Tommy also would
have been here.

1806
01:24:18.053 --> 01:24:19.888
and you know.
Carl Bunch. the drummer.

1807
01:24:19.955 --> 01:24:22.024
was still in the hospital
in Green Bay

1808
01:24:22.091 --> 01:24:23.826
with frostbitten fingers
and toes.

1809
01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:26.129
They mixed and matched.
Buddy would play drums.

1810
01:24:26.195 --> 01:24:28.631
and Ritchie would play drums.
and everybody.

1811
01:24:28.697 --> 01:24:31.667
they just figured out a way
to make the show.

1812
01:24:31.734 --> 01:24:34.170
- And I've been thinking
about Buddy Holly a lot.

1813
01:24:34.237 --> 01:24:36.605
When I came up with that
original part of the song.

1814
01:24:36.672 --> 01:24:39.975
it came out in a sad.
poignant way.

1815
01:24:40.042 --> 01:24:43.045
- When "American Pie" came on.
that was the time I believed

1816
01:24:43.112 --> 01:24:45.581
that the focus started
to be back on those guys.

1817
01:24:45.648 --> 01:24:48.617
- Well. I remember
the song was number one.

1818
01:24:48.684 --> 01:24:51.587
and they started
playing Buddy's music

1819
01:24:51.654 --> 01:24:53.088
on the radio again.

1820
01:24:53.156 --> 01:24:56.825
Buddy brought me to life.
I brought Buddy to life.

1821
01:24:56.892 --> 01:24:57.926
[laughs]

1822
01:25:02.131 --> 01:25:04.167
- Oh. my goodness.

1823
01:25:04.233 --> 01:25:05.801
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1824
01:25:05.868 --> 01:25:08.937
What a pleasure
and an honor. Mr. McLean.

1825
01:25:09.004 --> 01:25:11.039
Thank you. Thank you.

1826
01:25:11.106 --> 01:25:13.376
I have a little something
I want to say.

1827
01:25:13.442 --> 01:25:14.610
I just want to thank you

1828
01:25:14.677 --> 01:25:17.646
for writing
"The Day the Music Died."

1829
01:25:17.713 --> 01:25:23.018
You immortalized my brother.
JP. and Buddy.

1830
01:25:23.085 --> 01:25:28.491
You took a terrible tragedy
and made rock 'n' roll history.

1831
01:25:28.557 --> 01:25:32.161
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

1832
01:25:32.228 --> 01:25:33.596
See that up there?

1833
01:25:33.662 --> 01:25:36.399
- I hardly don't know
what to say.

1834
01:25:36.465 --> 01:25:37.600
- A friend of ours
painted that.

1835
01:25:37.666 --> 01:25:40.169
and all around
that is our family.

1836
01:25:40.236 --> 01:25:41.337
Everybody signed it.

1837
01:25:41.404 --> 01:25:42.705
- Your brother
is very important.

1838
01:25:42.771 --> 01:25:44.673
more important now than ever.

1839
01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:46.842
- Ritchie was
a rock 'n' roll pioneer.

1840
01:25:46.909 --> 01:25:48.076
- He was.

1841
01:25:48.143 --> 01:25:49.645
- The first time
I heard your song.

1842
01:25:49.712 --> 01:25:51.046
I had to keep listening to it.

1843
01:25:51.113 --> 01:25:52.781
because I thought.
"Oh. my gosh.

1844
01:25:52.848 --> 01:25:54.883
"He's singing about my brother.

1845
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:57.853
He's singing about the-- you
know. the day the music died."

1846
01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:03.125
- If the song helps people
love that music the way I do

1847
01:26:03.192 --> 01:26:05.994
and the way I did.
then that's something I did

1848
01:26:06.061 --> 01:26:08.464
in my life
that I'm very proud of.

1849
01:26:08.531 --> 01:26:10.065
We should never
forget this music.

1850
01:26:10.132 --> 01:26:12.167
- Never.
- And these guys were

1851
01:26:12.235 --> 01:26:13.602
incredibly important.

1852
01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:16.339
This was brand-new
at the time.

1853
01:26:16.405 --> 01:26:17.773
- Yes.

1854
01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:19.875
- Ritchie was only 17.
- He was only 17.

1855
01:26:19.942 --> 01:26:21.844
- So he started working
as a musician.

1856
01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:24.247
making some money. and then
he bought his Fender guitar.

1857
01:26:24.313 --> 01:26:25.548
- That's--yeah. that's right.

1858
01:26:25.614 --> 01:26:26.849
- So that's when he developed

1859
01:26:26.915 --> 01:26:28.717
that great sound
on that guitar.

1860
01:26:28.784 --> 01:26:30.353
- Yes.
- You know. it's that sort of

1861
01:26:30.419 --> 01:26:32.621
edgy. heavy sound. you know--

1862
01:26:32.688 --> 01:26:34.890
[imitates guitar]

1863
01:26:34.957 --> 01:26:36.692
You know. it's got
that thing to it.

1864
01:26:36.759 --> 01:26:38.361
very distinctive.

1865
01:26:38.427 --> 01:26:40.929
- * Para bailar La Bamba *

1866
01:26:40.996 --> 01:26:42.931
- You know. he sang
that traditional "La Bamba."

1867
01:26:42.998 --> 01:26:45.133
which he probably sang
with your family.

1868
01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:46.702
- Well. he made it
rock 'n' roll though.

1869
01:26:46.769 --> 01:26:48.437
- Yeah.
What's it about?

1870
01:26:48.504 --> 01:26:50.806
- "Para bailar La Bamba."
to dance the Bamba.

1871
01:26:50.873 --> 01:26:53.141
"Se necesito
una poca de gracia."

1872
01:26:53.208 --> 01:26:54.843
we need a little grace.

1873
01:26:54.910 --> 01:26:57.346
"Poquito para ti.
poquito para mi."

1874
01:26:57.413 --> 01:26:59.147
a little for you.
a little for me.

1875
01:26:59.214 --> 01:27:01.650
* Una poca de gracia.
para mi. para ti *

1876
01:27:01.717 --> 01:27:03.352
* Y arriba. y arriba *

1877
01:27:03.419 --> 01:27:05.321
Higher and higher.
- Great.

1878
01:27:05.388 --> 01:27:07.690
- Yeah.
- So it's simple lyrics.

1879
01:27:07.756 --> 01:27:09.057
but just so great.
- It is. yeah.

1880
01:27:09.124 --> 01:27:11.694
- Well. thank you
for coming here.

1881
01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:13.296
This is a big deal for me.

1882
01:27:13.362 --> 01:27:14.597
- Thank you so much.

1883
01:27:14.663 --> 01:27:16.365
God bless you.

1884
01:27:16.432 --> 01:27:17.966
- You take care now.
- I will.

1885
01:27:18.033 --> 01:27:19.201
both: Thank you.

1886
01:27:19.268 --> 01:27:23.506
[dreamy music]

1887
01:27:23.572 --> 01:27:25.374
- My name is Nelson Crabb.

1888
01:27:25.441 --> 01:27:28.711
and I happen to be the mayor
of Clear Lake. Iowa.

1889
01:27:28.777 --> 01:27:31.314
February 3rd of 1959.

1890
01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:33.882
I was a freshman
at Rutgers University.

1891
01:27:33.949 --> 01:27:37.152
Going back one Sunday.
when on the car radio.

1892
01:27:37.219 --> 01:27:39.755
I heard about this
terrible accident

1893
01:27:39.822 --> 01:27:41.624
just north of town here.

1894
01:27:41.690 --> 01:27:43.191
The car got quiet.

1895
01:27:43.258 --> 01:27:46.362
and. you know.
very. very sad time.

1896
01:27:46.429 --> 01:27:49.298
but tonight is when
we celebrate the music

1897
01:27:49.365 --> 01:27:53.302
of those three gentlemen.
and tonight is especially neat

1898
01:27:53.369 --> 01:27:57.005
because we have Don McLean's
"American Pie" here.

1899
01:27:57.072 --> 01:27:59.608
and that's very.
very neat for our community.

1900
01:27:59.675 --> 01:28:01.444
- Hey. everybody.

1901
01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:05.681
Welcome to Clear Lake. Iowa
and the legendary Surf Ballroom

1902
01:28:05.748 --> 01:28:08.751
for the 2022
Winter Dance Party.

1903
01:28:08.817 --> 01:28:13.055
Please welcome America's
legendary singer-songwriter.

1904
01:28:13.121 --> 01:28:18.727

Don McLean!

1905
01:28:18.794 --> 01:28:24.400
[cheers and applause]

1906
01:28:24.467 --> 01:28:25.801
- Well. all right!

1907
01:28:25.868 --> 01:28:27.670
So here we are.

1908
01:28:27.736 --> 01:28:30.072
50 years since
that song came out.

1909
01:28:30.138 --> 01:28:32.174
50 years.

1910
01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:33.542
It's incredible.

1911
01:28:33.609 --> 01:28:35.844
You take a time like this
to call that

1912
01:28:35.911 --> 01:28:38.381
"the day the music died"
from my song.

1913
01:28:38.447 --> 01:28:44.520
I am so touched. really.
to be here and to sing for you.

1914
01:28:44.587 --> 01:28:47.990
[cheers and applause]

1915
01:28:48.056 --> 01:28:50.893
* Did you write
the book of love? *

1916
01:28:50.959 --> 01:28:54.863
* Do you have faith
in God above? *

1917
01:28:54.930 --> 01:28:59.167
* If the Bible tells you so? *

1918
01:28:59.234 --> 01:29:02.738
* Now. do you believe
in rock n' roll? *

1919
01:29:02.805 --> 01:29:07.843
* Can music save
your mortal soul? *

1920
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:12.214
* Can you teach me
how to dance real slow? *

1921
01:29:13.682 --> 01:29:17.052
* Well. I know that you're
in love with him *

1922
01:29:17.119 --> 01:29:21.156
* 'Cause I saw you dancing
in the gym *

1923
01:29:21.223 --> 01:29:24.827
* You both kicked
off your shoes *

1924
01:29:24.893 --> 01:29:27.830
* I dig those
rhythm and blues *

1925
01:29:27.896 --> 01:29:32.100
* I was a lonely
teenage broncin' buck *

1926
01:29:32.167 --> 01:29:35.337
* With a pink carnation
and a pickup truck *

1927
01:29:35.404 --> 01:29:39.374
* But I knew
I was out of luck *

1928
01:29:39.442 --> 01:29:43.846
* The day the music died *

1929
01:29:43.912 --> 01:29:45.548
Come on. sing it!

1930
01:29:45.614 --> 01:29:50.218
* Started singing.
"Bye-bye. Miss American Pie" *

1931
01:29:50.285 --> 01:29:52.387
* Drove my Chevy to the levee *

1932
01:29:52.455 --> 01:29:53.989
* But the levee was dry *

1933
01:29:54.056 --> 01:29:57.560
* Them good old boys were
drinking whiskey and rye *

1934
01:29:57.626 --> 01:30:01.830
* Singing. "This'll be
the day that I die" *

1935
01:30:01.897 --> 01:30:05.333
* This will be the day
that I die *

1936
01:30:07.002 --> 01:30:12.875
* Bye-bye. Miss American Pie *

1937
01:30:12.941 --> 01:30:15.310
- I think the song
"American Pie" is just one

1938
01:30:15.377 --> 01:30:18.280
of those heartfelt
American classics that just

1939
01:30:18.346 --> 01:30:20.449
makes you pause
and be grateful

1940
01:30:20.516 --> 01:30:22.250
for everything that you have.

1941
01:30:26.154 --> 01:30:28.323
- "American Pie."
one of my favorite songs.

1942
01:30:28.390 --> 01:30:32.127
This night in 1959.
the day that music died.

1943
01:30:32.194 --> 01:30:34.530
but we believe
the music's still alive.

1944
01:30:34.597 --> 01:30:37.600
[orchestral cover
of "American Pie"]

1945

* *

1946
01:30:44.573 --> 01:30:46.141
- It's a classic song.

1947
01:30:46.208 --> 01:30:48.677
It spans the generations.
everyone loves it.

1948
01:30:48.744 --> 01:30:51.013
and it just will
live on forever.

1949
01:31:04.459 --> 01:31:07.763
all:
* Bye-bye. Miss American Pie *

1950
01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:09.732
* Drove my Chevy to the levee *

1951
01:31:09.798 --> 01:31:11.366
* But the levee was dry *

1952
01:31:11.433 --> 01:31:15.037
* Them good old boys were
drinking whiskey and rye *

1953
01:31:15.103 --> 01:31:18.240
* Singing. "This'll be
the day that I die" *

1954
01:31:18.306 --> 01:31:22.511
* This will be the day
that I die *

1955
01:31:24.112 --> 01:31:26.782
- * Helter skelter
in the summer swelter *

1956
01:31:26.849 --> 01:31:30.953
* The birds flew off
with a fallout shelter *

1957
01:31:31.019 --> 01:31:36.024
* Eight miles high
and falling fast *

1958
01:31:36.091 --> 01:31:38.994
* It landed foul
on the grass *

1959
01:31:39.061 --> 01:31:42.164
* the players tried
for a forward pass *

1960
01:31:42.230 --> 01:31:48.270
* With the jester
on the sidelines in a cast *

1961
01:31:48.336 --> 01:31:52.107
- * Now the halftime air
was sweet perfume *

1962
01:31:52.174 --> 01:31:55.844
* While the sergeants played
a marching tune *

1963
01:31:55.911 --> 01:31:58.480
* We all got up to dance *

1964
01:31:58.547 --> 01:32:02.084
* Oh. but we never
got the chance *

1965
01:32:02.150 --> 01:32:05.954
* 'Cause the players tried
to take the field *

1966
01:32:06.021 --> 01:32:09.391
* The marching band refused
to yield *

1967
01:32:09.457 --> 01:32:12.561
* Do you recall
what was revealed *

1968
01:32:12.628 --> 01:32:18.266
* The day the music died? *

1969
01:32:18.333 --> 01:32:22.671
- * We started singing.
"Bye-bye. Miss American Pie" *

1970
01:32:22.738 --> 01:32:27.175
* Drove my Chevy to the levee.
but the levee was dry *

* Them good old boys were
drinking whiskey and rye *

1972

* This'll be the day
that I die *

1974
01:32:39.622 --> 01:32:44.059
- * Oh. and there we were
all in one place *

1975
01:32:44.126 --> 01:32:47.295
* A generation lost in space *

1976
01:32:47.362 --> 01:32:50.899
* With no time left
to start again *

1977
01:32:52.334 --> 01:32:56.138
* So come on. Jack be nimble.
Jack be quick *

1978
01:32:56.204 --> 01:32:59.274
* Jack Flash sat
on a candlestick *

1979
01:32:59.341 --> 01:33:06.314
* 'Cause fire is
the devil's only friend *

1980
01:33:06.381 --> 01:33:09.785
- * Oh. and as I watched him
on the stage *

1981
01:33:09.852 --> 01:33:13.856
* My hands were clenched
in fists of rage *

1982
01:33:13.922 --> 01:33:16.725
* No angel born in hell *

1983
01:33:16.792 --> 01:33:20.195
* Could break
that Satan's spell *

1984
01:33:20.262 --> 01:33:24.466
* As the flames climbed high
into the night *

1985
01:33:24.532 --> 01:33:27.235
* To light
the sacrificial rite *

1986
01:33:27.302 --> 01:33:30.973
* I saw Satan laughing
with delight *

1987
01:33:31.039 --> 01:33:36.679
* The day the music died *

1988
01:33:36.745 --> 01:33:41.049
* He was singing.
"Bye-bye. Miss American Pie" *

1989
01:33:41.116 --> 01:33:44.953
* Drove my Chevy to the levee.
but the levee was dry *

* Them good old boys were
drinking whiskey and rye *

1991

* Singing. "This'll be
the day that I die" *

1992
01:33:52.594 --> 01:33:56.564
* This'll be the day
that I die *
