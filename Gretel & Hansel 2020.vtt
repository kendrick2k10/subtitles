holds a lesson.

It's the story
of the Beautiful Child

7

Her birth was a gift
to her mother and father

8
00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:02.595
she was
the most beautiful child.

9
00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:09.969
and it was predicted

10
00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:12.539
that her first winter
would be her last.

11
00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:18.211

such tidings passively.

told of an enchantress

with the power
to cure any ailment.

14
00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:39.698
All that was required
was for her father to be brave

15
00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:41.767
And he was.

16
00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:43.136
and he did.

17
00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:49.208
But when that enchantress
took away the illness.

18

she left in its place a gift.

19
00:01:53.946 --> 00:02:02.155
It came to be that the child
had been granted Second Sight.

20
00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:07.527
but then no one wanted to hear
what she saw.

21
00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:10.063

22

to the darkness that made her.

34
00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:58.478

and his own courage
to live it...

717
01:20:26.153 --> 01:20:27.989
I have my own power
to nurture.

718
01:20:29.023 --> 01:20:30.458
I'll help it to grow.

719
01:20:30.492 --> 01:20:32.960
and trust that I'll know
what to do with it.

720
01:20:32.994 --> 01:20:35.263
I know
that the choice is mine.

721
01:20:35.296 --> 01:21:06.528
I could feed it darkness.
or give it plenty of light.

722
01:21:06.561 --> 01:21:08.363
I looked. and I saw.

723
01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:10.532
and I understood.

724
01:21:13.534 --> 01:21:16.404
The captor now gone
and her fires all put out.

725
01:21:18.672 --> 01:21:20.075
they were free to go...

726
01:21:24.011 --> 01:21:25.480
and be at peace.

727
01:21:31.586 --> 01:21:33.188
And I was free.

728
01:21:35.089 --> 01:21:37.225
To go and never look back.

729
01:21:37.258 --> 01:21:38.993
or stay to build something new

730
01:21:39.027 --> 01:21:41.829
on top of everything
that had been destroyed.

731
01:21:41.862 --> 01:21:44.365
I knew my path
would reveal itself.

732
01:21:44.398 --> 01:21:47.502
and that all was required
for me was to be brave

733
01:21:47.535 --> 01:21:49.271
and to trust myself.

734
01:22:03.951 --> 01:22:05.387
And I am brave.

735
01:22:06.688 --> 01:22:08.523
And I will trust myself.
