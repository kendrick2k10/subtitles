00:01:34.712 --> 00:01:37.089
Bro! Excuse me! Sorry.

4
00:01:51.186 --> 00:01:52.396
Left.

5
00:02:18.047 --> 00:02:21.300
Stop sign. left.

6
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:50.537
One. two. three. four. five.

7
00:02:51.705 --> 00:02:53.582
On the right.

8
00:03:09.264 --> 00:03:10.099
Mr. Burnz?

9
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:12.976
Are you Charlie Burnz?

10
00:03:13.894 --> 00:03:15.813
Charlie Burnz. I'm talking to you.

11
00:03:16.855 --> 00:03:18.899
Mr. Burnz. Charlie Burnz.

12
00:03:38.043 --> 00:03:41.797
{\an8}Sweep up a little bit. Make sure
all the props are in the right spot.

13
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.133
{\an8}- Hey. Marge?
- Hey. Charlie.

14
00:03:44.216 --> 00:03:45.342
{\an8}Where is everybody?

15
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:49.930
{\an8}Charlie. it's Monday.
They're at the writers' meeting.

16
00:03:50.014 --> 00:03:54.268
{\an8}Oh. right. Well. I had a long weekend.

17
00:03:54.351 --> 00:03:56.437
{\an8}All right. take it easy. All right.

18
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.398
{\an8}Better hurry.
They're pitching new sketches!

19
00:03:59.481 --> 00:04:01.525
Yeah. we made sure to take a lot of care

20
00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:04.695
and not offend anybody
with this next sketch. so please strap in

21
00:04:04.778 --> 00:04:06.405
and. you know. enjoy.

22
00:04:06.488 --> 00:04:07.406
Okay. so this is...

23
00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.075
This is an infomercial
for a brand-new comedy album.

24
00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:14.455
We start with shots of planets and stars.
just these beautiful shots of space.

25
00:04:14.538 --> 00:04:17.623
And then. we hear a VO.
and we see a chyron.

26
00:04:17.707 --> 00:04:20.544
In the tradition of George Carlin
and Richard Pryor.

27
00:04:20.627 --> 00:04:22.504
we bring you the next comedy voice.

28
00:04:22.588 --> 00:04:25.841
And we cut to a photograph
of Stephen Hawking.

29
00:04:27.468 --> 00:04:29.928
But we photoshopped him
in front of a brick wall.

30
00:04:30.012 --> 00:04:31.805
So he looks like he's at a comedy club.

31
00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:33.849
We have a microphone
where his computer is.

32
00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:41.398
Is it just me. but what's the deal
with black holes? Am I right?

33
00:04:44.193 --> 00:04:47.029
You people like impressions?

34
00:04:54.495 --> 00:04:56.080
So how do you think the meeting went?

35
00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.792
Some very funny ideas.

36
00:04:59.875 --> 00:05:04.171
But. Brad. somebody's got to talk
to Roger about his inflections.

37
00:05:04.254 --> 00:05:06.340
I know. I know. I think he gets nervous.

38
00:05:06.423 --> 00:05:07.591
No. come on.

39
00:05:07.675 --> 00:05:09.718
George Carlin. Richard Pryor.

40
00:05:09.802 --> 00:05:13.847
My God. Stephen Hawking pronounced
his name better than he does.

41
00:05:13.931 --> 00:05:15.474
Here's one for the news segment.

42
00:05:15.557 --> 00:05:18.435
Or as Roger calls it. the news "seg-ment."

43
00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:20.396
All right. I'll give this to the guys.

44
00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.690
By the way. there's a new invention
called computers.

45
00:05:22.773 --> 00:05:24.108
You may wanna get one.

46
00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:26.694
You know. I had one. but I like this.

47
00:05:26.777 --> 00:05:29.071
We started out together.
I love the feel of the paper.

48
00:05:29.154 --> 00:05:33.033
I like the fact that the key leaves a mark
that wasn't there a second ago.

49
00:05:33.117 --> 00:05:35.911
But I did treat myself to one of these.

50
00:05:36.912 --> 00:05:38.497
Look at you. You know how to work it?

51
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.709
Absolutely. unless I wanna send an e-mail.
a text. or make a phone call.

52
00:05:41.792 --> 00:05:43.544
- Oh. that's not important.
- Not at all.

53
00:05:43.627 --> 00:05:46.255
- Wanna get something to eat?
- I have a lunch date.

54
00:05:46.338 --> 00:05:47.965
Look at you. Mr. Social.

55
00:05:48.048 --> 00:05:51.135
It's someone who won an auction
to have lunch with me at the charity event

56
00:05:51.218 --> 00:05:52.803
for inner-city libraries.

57
00:05:52.886 --> 00:05:53.929
Sounds like a blast.

58
00:06:01.395 --> 00:06:03.981
This restaurant nice. Excuse me.

59
00:06:04.481 --> 00:06:05.858
Oh. no.

60
00:06:06.233 --> 00:06:07.985
Sorry. Bye.

61
00:06:08.068 --> 00:06:10.446
Maybe you. sir. Hello.

62
00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:14.491
Oh. Phil Donahue. Nice to meet you.

63
00:06:14.575 --> 00:06:18.454
- The hell was that all about?
- Sir. hi.

64
00:06:18.537 --> 00:06:21.707
Oh. no. sorry. sorry to bother you.
Wrong person.

65
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.459
Excuse me. Bye-bye.

66
00:06:24.126 --> 00:06:27.212
Excuse me. Are you. by any chance.
looking for me?

67
00:06:27.296 --> 00:06:28.547
I'm Charlie Burnz.

68
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.341
- You gotta be shitting me.
- What?

69
00:06:30.424 --> 00:06:31.425
This was you?

70
00:06:31.508 --> 00:06:33.344
Yeah. Yeah. yeah. yeah.

71
00:06:33.427 --> 00:06:35.262
You took some hits along the way. huh?

72
00:06:35.346 --> 00:06:37.848
Yeah. you might say that.
but that's a very old picture.

73
00:06:37.931 --> 00:06:41.352
That was actually taken on the <i>Mayflower.</i>
I did win the shuffleboard tournament.

74
00:06:42.394 --> 00:06:45.689
Well. belated congratulations.
I'm Emma Payge.

75
00:06:45.773 --> 00:06:47.816
- Emma. pleasure. thank you. Sit down.
- Sorry I'm late.

76
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.070
Don't worry about it. Not a problem.
Glad you're here.

77
00:06:51.153 --> 00:06:53.197
And thank you for bidding
on me at the auction.

78
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.075
I'm so flattered that somebody your age
would be a fan of my work.

79
00:06:57.034 --> 00:06:58.827
- Truth?
- Sure.

80
00:06:58.911 --> 00:07:00.913
I don't know who the hell you are.

81
00:07:01.205 --> 00:07:02.956
My ex bid on you.

82
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.583
- You didn't?
- Nope.

83
00:07:05.584 --> 00:07:06.752
How did this...?

84
00:07:06.835 --> 00:07:09.088
Well. he's an actor.
and he was doing a scene

85
00:07:09.171 --> 00:07:10.964
from one of your plays
in his acting class.

86
00:07:11.048 --> 00:07:12.800
and he wanted to meet you.
so he bid.

87
00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:16.053
- How much?
- Twenty-two.

88
00:07:16.136 --> 00:07:20.391
- $2200? That's fantastic.
- $2200. my ass!

89
00:07:20.474 --> 00:07:22.351
$22.

90
00:07:22.434 --> 00:07:24.853
$22 was the winning bid?

91
00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:29.858
It started at 20. and then it went up
in 50-cent increments.

92
00:07:29.942 --> 00:07:32.194
Oh. that's so sad.

93
00:07:32.277 --> 00:07:34.988
Hello. Welcome to Le Monde.

94
00:07:35.072 --> 00:07:37.199
I'll be your server.
What can I get for you?

95
00:07:37.282 --> 00:07:38.659
- Have you eaten here before?
- No.

96
00:07:38.742 --> 00:07:42.579
They have the greatest steak sandwich.
That's all I get. It's fantastic.

97
00:07:42.663 --> 00:07:44.707
That's perfect.
I'll have the seafood salad.

98
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.461
- Okay. And for you. sir?
- I'm gonna have the...

99
00:07:49.545 --> 00:07:53.841
Oh. can I have extra clams.
extra calamari. and extra crab meat?

100
00:07:54.842 --> 00:07:57.428
- Of course. And for you. sir?
- I'm gonna have the...

101
00:07:57.511 --> 00:08:01.557
Oh. and can I have a lobster tail
right on top. with extra mussels?

102
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.641
Lots of mussels.

103
00:08:02.725 --> 00:08:05.811
The ones from New Zealand. not from Jersey
because they got black hairs.

104
00:08:05.894 --> 00:08:08.355
Who knows what's in those?
That can be really toxic.

105
00:08:08.439 --> 00:08:11.984
Are you done? Because there are
a few species you haven't mentioned yet.

106
00:08:12.568 --> 00:08:13.569
Go ahead.

107
00:08:13.652 --> 00:08:16.572
- I'm gonna have the...
- Oh. can I have a Diet Coke?

108
00:08:17.656 --> 00:08:19.408
And for you. sir?

109
00:08:19.491 --> 00:08:22.619
I'm gonna have a tuna sandwich.
whole wheat toast. and an iced tea.

110
00:08:22.703 --> 00:08:25.164
Very good.

111
00:08:25.998 --> 00:08:28.375
Why would you order a tuna sandwich
when you said

112
00:08:28.459 --> 00:08:30.127
they had the best steak sandwiches?

113
00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.504
While you were ordering half
of the Atlantic Ocean.

114
00:08:32.588 --> 00:08:35.758
I developed a hankering
for the only fish left on the menu.

115
00:08:36.342 --> 00:08:39.177
Touché. old man. Touché.

116
00:08:39.927 --> 00:08:41.180
So let me ask you a question.

117
00:08:41.263 --> 00:08:43.640
If you don't know who I am.
how come your ex didn't come?

118
00:08:44.224 --> 00:08:45.934
I caught him cheating on me.

119
00:08:46.018 --> 00:08:49.438
And he said it was because
I'm the worst lay in the world.

120
00:08:49.521 --> 00:08:52.566
And trust me. he is wrong. okay?

121
00:08:52.649 --> 00:08:56.028
You ought to see my moves.
It's "Circus Doleil."

122
00:08:56.737 --> 00:08:59.448
Okay. Well. let's...
Let's get through lunch first.

123
00:09:00.074 --> 00:09:02.326
- I'd break your back. old man.
- Thank you.

124
00:09:02.409 --> 00:09:05.496
Yeah. have you laid out. dead.
with a smile on your face.

125
00:09:06.205 --> 00:09:10.125
And your kids will be like.
"How did he die? How did my dad die?"

126
00:09:10.209 --> 00:09:12.795
And I would just look at them
in their eyes and say.

127
00:09:12.878 --> 00:09:13.921
on top of me.

128
00:09:17.883 --> 00:09:19.426
That's a really lovely thought.

129
00:09:20.678 --> 00:09:22.971
You funny. old man.

130
00:09:23.055 --> 00:09:27.726
I'm glad I came. even if it was
to shove you up my ex's big fat ass.

131
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.104
Now. there's a compliment
you don't hear every day.

132
00:09:31.605 --> 00:09:34.441
- Whoa. look what the tide brought in.
- Yeah.

133
00:09:34.525 --> 00:09:36.610
- Thank you very much.
- Please enjoy.

134
00:09:36.694 --> 00:09:38.570
Emma. enjoy your buffet.

135
00:09:39.113 --> 00:09:42.533
So... I take it you like comedy.

136
00:09:43.325 --> 00:09:44.284
Nope.

137
00:09:44.368 --> 00:09:45.703
You don't?

138
00:09:45.786 --> 00:09:49.456
I mean. I love to laugh. but in real life.
You know what I'm saying?

139
00:09:50.249 --> 00:09:53.961
Well. you know. that's what I do
in real life. I'm a comedy writer.

140
00:09:54.044 --> 00:09:56.505
You ever watch <i>This Just In</i>
on Sunday nights on Funny?

141
00:09:58.424 --> 00:10:02.720
I also write some Broadway and movies
and five books.

142
00:10:03.721 --> 00:10:05.723
And what do you do?

143
00:10:05.806 --> 00:10:09.351
Charlie. I don't feel so good.

144
00:10:09.435 --> 00:10:11.729
Why is your face suddenly bigger
than it was before?

145
00:10:11.812 --> 00:10:15.858
- I can't feel my lips.
- Oh. are you allergic to seafood?

146
00:10:15.941 --> 00:10:17.443
Oh. shit. maybe I am.

147
00:10:17.526 --> 00:10:18.610
What should I do?

148
00:10:18.694 --> 00:10:21.947
- Call the hospital. Call the hospital!
- What? What?

149
00:10:22.031 --> 00:10:23.657
Call the hospital!

150
00:10:24.533 --> 00:10:27.036
Dial the nearest hospital!
Dial the nearest hospital!

151
00:10:27.119 --> 00:10:29.038
<i>I do not know. Let me check the Web.</i>

152
00:10:29.121 --> 00:10:31.332
- Dial the nearest hospital!
- Is everything all right?

153
00:10:31.415 --> 00:10:34.084
Oh. my God! Oh. my God!
Okay. what did you do?

154
00:10:34.168 --> 00:10:35.085
I didn't do anything!

155
00:10:35.169 --> 00:10:36.337
These are Jersey mussels!

156
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.630
- What?
- I knew they were Jersey mussels!

157
00:10:38.714 --> 00:10:41.550
- Jersey? No! I'm from Jersey.
- I need emergency. Emergency.

158
00:10:41.633 --> 00:10:42.634
This is an emergency.

159
00:10:45.095 --> 00:10:46.930
Everybody. calm down. Everybody. relax.

160
00:10:47.014 --> 00:10:50.642
- We should call the ambulance.
- Siri! What is wrong with you?

161
00:10:51.435 --> 00:10:54.021
Ma'am. have you had an allergic reaction
to seafood before?

162
00:10:54.855 --> 00:10:57.066
You just randomly ordered.
and this is what happened?

163
00:10:57.149 --> 00:11:01.403
- I had a hankering.
- Okay. just relax. We're almost there.

164
00:11:01.487 --> 00:11:03.197
You're gonna be okay.

165
00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.491
Charlie? Charlie.

166
00:11:05.574 --> 00:11:08.619
Charlie!

167
00:11:08.702 --> 00:11:12.414
You're all I've got. Charlie.
don't leave me!

168
00:11:29.306 --> 00:11:30.516
Oh. boy.

169
00:11:32.851 --> 00:11:34.645
Mr. Burnz?

170
00:11:36.689 --> 00:11:38.857
Oh. I'm not supposed
to fill these forms out.

171
00:11:38.941 --> 00:11:41.819
- What's your relation to Miss Payge?
- She won me in an auction.

172
00:11:43.362 --> 00:11:44.530
Fine. don't believe me.

173
00:11:44.613 --> 00:11:45.864
She doesn't have insurance.

174
00:11:45.948 --> 00:11:48.575
and she really shouldn't be leaving here
by herself.

175
00:11:48.659 --> 00:11:50.202
No insurance?

176
00:11:50.285 --> 00:11:51.745
Okay.

177
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:53.330
$1100?

178
00:11:53.956 --> 00:11:56.375
Yes. And you'll get the ambulance bill
in the mail.

179
00:11:57.418 --> 00:11:59.211
You can pay me on the way out.

180
00:11:59.795 --> 00:12:02.381
- Your daughter is going to be fine.
- My d...?

181
00:12:02.464 --> 00:12:04.341
Great. Isn't that great?

182
00:12:04.425 --> 00:12:08.053
She told me all about how you adopted her
from that orphanage in Kenya.

183
00:12:08.137 --> 00:12:09.930
- That's very special.
- Oh. she told you?

184
00:12:10.014 --> 00:12:11.890
- Yeah.
- Yeah. well...

185
00:12:11.974 --> 00:12:14.309
Well. she is special.

186
00:12:14.393 --> 00:12:16.103
Well. this is a pretty severe reaction.

187
00:12:16.186 --> 00:12:18.313
Are there other allergies
that I should know about?

188
00:12:18.397 --> 00:12:20.649
Well. I think really you should talk
to her about that

189
00:12:20.733 --> 00:12:24.111
or I can put you in touch
with one of the elders of her tribe.

190
00:12:24.194 --> 00:12:26.739
You could ask for Mbolo.

191
00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:29.867
It's good that you reacted
as quickly as you did.

192
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:31.952
A little longer
may have been a different story.

193
00:12:32.036 --> 00:12:34.038
Here are her prescriptions.

194
00:12:34.121 --> 00:12:35.998
Pharmacy is that way.

195
00:12:39.668 --> 00:12:41.128
$600?

196
00:12:42.838 --> 00:12:45.007
So far. a tuna sandwich
cost me close to two grand.

197
00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.801
- Welcome to New York. pal.
- What's this?

198
00:12:47.885 --> 00:12:50.471
That's epinephrine.
You need to inject her within the hour.

199
00:12:50.554 --> 00:12:52.056
- And if I don't?
- She'll die.

200
00:12:53.057 --> 00:12:54.058
Next.

201
00:12:55.893 --> 00:13:01.857
"Remove blue safety release
by pulling up. straight up."

202
00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:04.026
- Okay.
- What's taking so long?

203
00:13:04.109 --> 00:13:06.653
I'm having trouble reading the directions
without my glasses.

204
00:13:06.737 --> 00:13:09.114
And honestly.
I'm a little nervous about it.

205
00:13:09.198 --> 00:13:10.324
- Okay.
- Oh. no.

206
00:13:10.407 --> 00:13:12.743
Hell. no. Put that thing down.

207
00:13:12.826 --> 00:13:15.621
Ain't no way in hell I'm gonna let you
stab me with that Lego stick

208
00:13:15.704 --> 00:13:18.666
while your hand shaking like that.
You might put out one of my eyes.

209
00:13:18.749 --> 00:13:21.710
But they said I have to do it
within the hour or you'll be in trouble.

210
00:13:21.794 --> 00:13:24.630
Well. we'll just wait an hour.
If I'm not dead. you can go home.

211
00:13:24.713 --> 00:13:26.715
Fine. Enjoy your bloating.

212
00:13:29.635 --> 00:13:31.887
All right. Stick me. old man.

213
00:13:40.646 --> 00:13:41.897
Motherf...!

214
00:13:43.357 --> 00:13:44.775
Son of a...!

215
00:13:46.402 --> 00:13:47.319
Okay.

216
00:13:47.403 --> 00:13:49.488
Show time's over.

217
00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.742
Make me some tea. maybe it'll
help with the bloating...

218
00:13:53.826 --> 00:13:56.745
"Only hold in for a few seconds."

219
00:14:03.752 --> 00:14:05.087
"Slippery when wet?"

220
00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:07.297
- You looked?
- I had to. I really...

221
00:14:07.381 --> 00:14:10.843
I had to. That's not something you wanna
do with your eyes closed. Believe me.

222
00:14:10.926 --> 00:14:13.846
It could have ended up someplace
that we would not be happy about.

223
00:14:15.514 --> 00:14:19.727
Thank you. I promise I will pay you back
every dime that you laid out.

224
00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:21.937
You don't have to do that.
How are you feeling?

225
00:14:22.021 --> 00:14:24.440
Like you shot me up
with five six-hour energy drinks.

226
00:14:24.523 --> 00:14:27.776
So I've got about a good 30 hours
of energy! I'm lit!

227
00:14:29.486 --> 00:14:31.405
- Can I ask you something?
- What?

228
00:14:31.488 --> 00:14:33.323
Why did you tell the doctor
that I was your father?

229
00:14:33.407 --> 00:14:36.076
I thought it would be cool
to have a white dad.

230
00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.287
And the orphanage story?

231
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:39.872
I was a little loopy by then.

232
00:14:39.955 --> 00:14:41.665
I'm sure that was the mussels talking.

233
00:14:41.749 --> 00:14:43.667
Yup. those mussels
were definitely talking.

234
00:14:43.751 --> 00:14:45.586
Yeah. must have been.

235
00:14:45.669 --> 00:14:48.339
Well. listen. try to get some rest.

236
00:14:48.422 --> 00:14:50.507
Do you need anything else?
I have 20 bucks left.

237
00:14:51.967 --> 00:14:53.135
I'll be fine.

238
00:14:53.218 --> 00:14:56.597
Look. I wanna apologize to you
for saying all that stuff about my ex.

239
00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.223
I should have never done that.

240
00:14:58.307 --> 00:15:01.018
You are a good man.
and that was not fair to you.

241
00:15:01.101 --> 00:15:04.355
- Hey. I understand. This way out?
- Yep. that way.

242
00:15:05.814 --> 00:15:07.232
- Perky.
- Yeah.

243
00:15:19.453 --> 00:15:20.579
Good try.

244
00:15:23.374 --> 00:15:25.876
- All right. that's...
- It's all right. It's a base hit.

245
00:15:36.011 --> 00:15:37.930
Sorry. Rex. That's a match.

246
00:15:40.432 --> 00:15:42.017
I don't know why you play against me.

247
00:15:42.101 --> 00:15:44.687
- It's good aerobics.
- Yeah. for me.

248
00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:47.856
I'm running around like crazy.
I'm gasping for air. You just...

249
00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:50.776
You just stand at the net.
Somehow it's six-love. six-love.

250
00:15:50.859 --> 00:15:52.903
- Six-love?
- Six feet...

251
00:15:52.986 --> 00:15:55.572
You get perverse pleasure
beating your only son like this?

252
00:15:55.656 --> 00:15:56.824
Yeah. a lot.

253
00:16:00.327 --> 00:16:01.495
Listen. Dad...

254
00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:06.917
Francine wants to know if you are coming
to Lindsay's bat mitzvah.

255
00:16:08.043 --> 00:16:11.255
My daughter wants to know if I'm coming
to my granddaughter's bat mitzvah?

256
00:16:11.338 --> 00:16:13.966
- Why wouldn't I?
- She says you never RSVP'd.

257
00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:19.263
Why didn't she just call
instead of asking you to ask me?

258
00:16:19.346 --> 00:16:21.140
Dad. don't be upset.
You know how she gets.

259
00:16:21.223 --> 00:16:22.891
It'll be a fun day. We'll be together.

260
00:16:22.975 --> 00:16:25.352
I don't want Lindsay to think
that I wasn't gonna come.

261
00:16:25.436 --> 00:16:27.646
Who knows what your sister says to her?

262
00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:29.648
Just give her a call.

263
00:16:31.734 --> 00:16:34.903
This was fun. I'll see you next week?

264
00:16:34.987 --> 00:16:37.573
When I lose to you. again.

265
00:16:37.656 --> 00:16:39.074
I gotta go.

266
00:16:39.158 --> 00:16:41.869
I have a 3:00. I'm a little nervous.

267
00:16:41.952 --> 00:16:45.748
I'm submitting my design
for a new building in Union Square.

268
00:16:45.831 --> 00:16:48.334
Well. it could be a big thing for me.

269
00:16:48.417 --> 00:16:50.794
I RSVP'd. I know I RSVP'd.

270
00:16:50.878 --> 00:16:54.006
Dad. don't worry about that.
And wish me luck.

271
00:16:54.715 --> 00:16:55.841
About what?

272
00:16:58.093 --> 00:17:00.012
For my building. for the design.

273
00:17:00.679 --> 00:17:04.892
Oh. oh. oh. yeah. yeah. yeah. Yeah.

274
00:17:05.893 --> 00:17:07.561
Yeah. I'll see you.

275
00:17:09.145 --> 00:17:11.106
I'm gonna call her right now.

276
00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:13.609
<i>Daddy! Daddy!</i>

277
00:17:13.692 --> 00:17:14.902
Daddy!

278
00:17:14.985 --> 00:17:16.111
Daddy!

279
00:17:16.194 --> 00:17:19.280
I did something wrong. Daddy!

280
00:17:19.365 --> 00:17:22.116
I'm scared! Daddy!

281
00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.328
<i>Daddy!</i>

282
00:17:34.338 --> 00:17:37.883
Oh. hi. This is... Craziest thing. I...

283
00:17:37.966 --> 00:17:40.761
- I forgot what locker I was using.
- That's okay.

284
00:17:40.844 --> 00:17:41.804
I have a master.

285
00:17:42.888 --> 00:17:45.933
- Let's start with this row.
- Okay. good.

286
00:18:11.125 --> 00:18:12.584
That's perfect.

287
00:18:12.668 --> 00:18:15.879
You're gonna crush this.
Give me a high-five.

288
00:18:17.131 --> 00:18:19.925
I'm proud of you.
You're doing so beautifully.

289
00:18:20.009 --> 00:18:24.096
Yeah. I'm just getting a little nervous
about my speech.

290
00:18:24.179 --> 00:18:27.391
- Have you started writing it yet?
- Yeah.

291
00:18:30.936 --> 00:18:32.521
It's your grandfather.

292
00:18:34.356 --> 00:18:35.274
Hi. Papa Charlie.

293
00:18:35.357 --> 00:18:38.193
Hey. Lindsay. honey.
How's my bat mitzvah girl?

294
00:18:38.277 --> 00:18:39.528
Good.

295
00:18:39.611 --> 00:18:40.988
Ask him if he's coming.

296
00:18:41.071 --> 00:18:42.865
What do you mean? Grandpa's not coming?

297
00:18:42.948 --> 00:18:44.908
- Are you coming?
- That's why I'm calling.

298
00:18:46.618 --> 00:18:49.163
Of course I'm coming.
I wouldn't miss that for the world.

299
00:18:49.246 --> 00:18:52.583
- Great. I'm so happy.
- <i>Hey. when you're happy. I'm happy.</i>

300
00:18:52.666 --> 00:18:56.587
- Can I speak to your Mom?
- <i>Tell him I can't talk to him right now.</i>

301
00:18:58.339 --> 00:19:00.674
She said she'll call you back.

302
00:19:01.258 --> 00:19:03.052
Yeah. Okay.

303
00:19:03.135 --> 00:19:04.595
I can't wait to see you.

304
00:19:04.678 --> 00:19:05.929
<i>I can't wait to see you too.</i>

305
00:19:06.013 --> 00:19:08.932
So tell me. You got a pretty dress?

306
00:19:09.016 --> 00:19:10.726
You're gonna have to see when you come.

307
00:19:10.809 --> 00:19:13.020
<i>Okay.</i>

308
00:19:14.313 --> 00:19:16.690
Can you help me with my speech?

309
00:19:16.774 --> 00:19:19.735
Yeah. of course.
We'll punch it up real good.

310
00:19:20.903 --> 00:19:24.406
- Yeah.
- <i>Okay. kid. See you soon.</i>

311
00:19:25.157 --> 00:19:26.825
I had a bad day.

312
00:19:27.826 --> 00:19:31.121
Thanks for seeing me so late.
I really appreciate it.

313
00:19:31.205 --> 00:19:37.336
I... I couldn't remember
where my locker was in my health club.

314
00:19:37.419 --> 00:19:39.588
I've been going there for years.

315
00:19:40.214 --> 00:19:42.091
So damn embarrassing.

316
00:19:42.174 --> 00:19:44.009
That should be expected.

317
00:19:44.093 --> 00:19:47.888
Don't panic.
Are you doing what we talked about?

318
00:19:48.889 --> 00:19:51.600
Yeah. I tried not to vary my routine.

319
00:19:51.684 --> 00:19:55.062
I walk the same way to work every day.
I eat right.

320
00:19:55.854 --> 00:19:57.731
Getting some exercise.

321
00:19:57.815 --> 00:20:00.234
And I'm taking my meds.

322
00:20:00.317 --> 00:20:02.986
And by the way. that Namenda.

323
00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:05.989
Oh. man. it's so constipating.

324
00:20:06.073 --> 00:20:07.449
- It... Sorry?
- Sorry about that.

325
00:20:07.533 --> 00:20:11.620
I was backed up for eight days. I felt
like a python that had swallowed a deer.

326
00:20:12.955 --> 00:20:16.792
Charlie. you have medicines
to help you with that.

327
00:20:16.875 --> 00:20:18.794
and you can always give yourself an enema.

328
00:20:18.877 --> 00:20:23.424
I'm saving that for my birthday.
A little something special just for me.

329
00:20:24.383 --> 00:20:25.467
How are you sleeping?

330
00:20:26.552 --> 00:20:29.805
Why sleep when you can
stay up and terrorize yourself?

331
00:20:30.723 --> 00:20:32.683
Maybe I get four hours. maybe.

332
00:20:32.766 --> 00:20:34.685
And what about those flashbacks?

333
00:20:35.561 --> 00:20:37.855
That's the craziest thing.

334
00:20:37.938 --> 00:20:41.483
I can forget what I had for lunch
while I'm having lunch.

335
00:20:41.567 --> 00:20:44.278
But then. something flies into my head.
like. bam!

336
00:20:44.361 --> 00:20:47.740
It could be a moment.
a fragment. a sentence.

337
00:20:47.823 --> 00:20:49.450
And it's like I'm there.

338
00:20:49.533 --> 00:20:53.370
Like I can see it like I saw it
way back then. It doesn't...

339
00:20:53.454 --> 00:20:57.082
It's almost like I can smell things.
And then. black.

340
00:20:57.166 --> 00:21:00.544
It just goes black.
and it goes as fast as it came.

341
00:21:00.627 --> 00:21:02.629
It's the craziest thing.

342
00:21:05.132 --> 00:21:08.802
- How's the writing going?
- I think it helps.

343
00:21:08.886 --> 00:21:12.473
It keeps my mind active. and it helps
strengthen my denial.

344
00:21:12.556 --> 00:21:15.851
You know what. this show.
it's all of these young kids.

345
00:21:15.934 --> 00:21:19.688
I'm like the old man on the block whose
yard you don't wanna hit the ball into.

346
00:21:20.564 --> 00:21:23.359
But I still get stuff on the air.

347
00:21:23.442 --> 00:21:25.861
I still help shape the show.

348
00:21:25.944 --> 00:21:29.490
and when one of my jokes hits right.
and the audience laughs.

349
00:21:29.573 --> 00:21:30.991
there's still nothing like it.

350
00:21:31.075 --> 00:21:33.535
And I still love it.

351
00:21:33.619 --> 00:21:35.788
Good. I think you're doing well.

352
00:21:35.871 --> 00:21:40.584
We're keeping this at bay.
but it's so damn unpredictable.

353
00:21:40.668 --> 00:21:45.297
Don't let your denial
overrule your sense of reason.

354
00:21:45.381 --> 00:21:48.550
There's a lot we still don't know
about this kind of dementia.

355
00:21:50.552 --> 00:21:51.387
Okay.

356
00:21:52.805 --> 00:21:54.723
- See you next month.
- Okay.

357
00:21:54.807 --> 00:21:57.351
- Unless you need me sooner.
- Okay.

358
00:21:57.434 --> 00:21:59.103
Thanks. my friend.

359
00:22:00.813 --> 00:22:03.607
Oh. by the way. I thought
the show last week was pretty good.

360
00:22:03.691 --> 00:22:05.067
Was it?

361
00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:08.404
- Who was on?
- You know. the guy. what's-his-name?

362
00:22:08.487 --> 00:22:12.491
The... From the film. He's married to...

363
00:22:12.908 --> 00:22:14.243
The one with the hair.

364
00:22:16.161 --> 00:22:18.497
Would you like some of my meds?

365
00:22:51.822 --> 00:22:56.744
You just gonna push the lady down. huh?
You just gonna run over somebody!

366
00:22:56.827 --> 00:22:58.078
You son of a bitch!

367
00:22:58.162 --> 00:23:01.582
Come back here and try that again.
you spineless bastard!

368
00:23:02.916 --> 00:23:04.585
Hey. hey. hey.

369
00:23:04.668 --> 00:23:06.462
What happened?

370
00:23:09.381 --> 00:23:14.219
I was going up the right. when I got
into a head-on collision with a dumbass

371
00:23:14.303 --> 00:23:18.432
who was coming down on the right side.
but really that's his left side.

372
00:23:18.515 --> 00:23:21.226
And it's all his fault
because this isn't England!

373
00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:23.395
How did you know where I live?

374
00:23:23.479 --> 00:23:24.813
- Google.
- Google?

375
00:23:24.897 --> 00:23:26.523
- Here.
- What's this?

376
00:23:26.607 --> 00:23:29.526
The first installment
of the money I owe you.

377
00:23:31.153 --> 00:23:33.113
You're a pole dancer?

378
00:23:33.197 --> 00:23:37.660
God. no. And this coming from a man
that makes America laugh for a living.

379
00:23:37.743 --> 00:23:39.036
My knee!

380
00:23:39.119 --> 00:23:42.414
- My fucking knees!
- Listen. listen. come upstairs.

381
00:23:42.498 --> 00:23:46.251
I'll clean you up a little bit.
and then we can rinse out your mouth.

382
00:23:46.335 --> 00:23:47.795
Come on.

383
00:23:49.421 --> 00:23:53.634
Oh. okay. okay.

384
00:23:54.593 --> 00:23:55.678
Jeez.

385
00:23:56.595 --> 00:24:00.557
Man. this dude is doing it. This is nice.

386
00:24:01.725 --> 00:24:03.811
{\an8}You know a lot of old white people.

387
00:24:04.603 --> 00:24:06.855
Oprah Winfrey?

388
00:24:08.023 --> 00:24:09.775
"For Carrie"?

389
00:24:10.984 --> 00:24:12.486
Okay. here we go.

390
00:24:12.569 --> 00:24:16.990
According to this wall. not only are you
ancient. but you're also famous.

391
00:24:17.074 --> 00:24:17.950
Sit here.

392
00:24:26.625 --> 00:24:28.585
You a serial killer?

393
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:31.588
- What do you mean?
- Well. isn't that what serial killers do?

394
00:24:31.672 --> 00:24:35.300
Collect pictures of everyone they
butchered and buried in their backyard?

395
00:24:36.427 --> 00:24:38.053
Other knee.

396
00:24:41.265 --> 00:24:43.267
- Who are they?
- Who?

397
00:24:45.352 --> 00:24:47.354
Oh. that's my family.

398
00:24:48.188 --> 00:24:50.607
Why do you have
their names written down?

399
00:24:51.316 --> 00:24:55.070
I'm writing something about them.
and it helps me stay focused.

400
00:24:56.071 --> 00:24:57.406
How did you become a writer?

401
00:24:58.615 --> 00:25:01.410
I don't think you become one.
I think you just are.

402
00:25:02.202 --> 00:25:03.871
When I was a kid I thought it was fun

403
00:25:03.954 --> 00:25:06.123
to take the truth
and make it more interesting.

404
00:25:06.832 --> 00:25:07.833
So you're a liar?

405
00:25:09.043 --> 00:25:11.253
I'm just kidding. That's beautiful.

406
00:25:11.337 --> 00:25:13.422
Yeah. Well. you're as good as new.

407
00:25:14.173 --> 00:25:15.049
Thanks.

408
00:25:16.884 --> 00:25:17.926
What was here?

409
00:25:18.594 --> 00:25:20.596
There was some picture that fell.

410
00:25:20.679 --> 00:25:22.639
Housekeeper
put it someplace. I don't know.

411
00:25:23.307 --> 00:25:24.808
Listen. I gotta get back to work.

412
00:25:24.892 --> 00:25:27.895
You gotta get back to making up shit
because your real life is boring?

413
00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:30.064
Something like that. yeah.

414
00:25:30.564 --> 00:25:33.650
Thanks for bringing me the bag
of laundered money.

415
00:25:33.734 --> 00:25:35.652
The Corleones will be very pleased.

416
00:25:36.904 --> 00:25:38.364
But you didn't have to do that.

417
00:25:38.447 --> 00:25:41.200
That's where you're wrong.
old man. I did.

418
00:25:42.117 --> 00:25:42.993
Bye-bye.

419
00:25:44.953 --> 00:25:49.875
Next is Sarah and Roger.
Paula and Gary wrote this.

420
00:25:50.501 --> 00:25:52.795
A cheesy ad for a law firm.

421
00:25:53.462 --> 00:25:55.005
Hello. I'm Jerry Loomis.

422
00:25:55.089 --> 00:25:56.674
And I'm Lorraine Loomis.

423
00:25:56.757 --> 00:25:58.008
When we got married.

424
00:25:58.092 --> 00:26:01.553
the rules of dating were much
less confusing than they are today.

425
00:26:01.637 --> 00:26:03.055
And that's where we come in.

426
00:26:03.138 --> 00:26:04.348
We're the Sex Refs.

427
00:26:06.141 --> 00:26:08.185
We go on your dates with you.

428
00:26:08.268 --> 00:26:10.062
Maintaining a safe distance.

429
00:26:10.145 --> 00:26:11.438
So if there's any hanky...

430
00:26:11.522 --> 00:26:12.439
Or panky.

431
00:26:12.523 --> 00:26:15.734
We're there to help clarify what
both parties' intentions are.

432
00:26:15.818 --> 00:26:17.653
So there's no misunderstandings

433
00:26:17.736 --> 00:26:20.656
that could lead
to accusations and lawsuits.

434
00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:24.368
We deal with the he said-she said
aspects of miscommunication.

435
00:26:24.451 --> 00:26:28.539
For example. you're in a parked car
and she says. "Would you like to kiss me?"

436
00:26:28.622 --> 00:26:30.207
But he said she said:

437
00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:32.584
"Honey. can you please
stick your thumb up my ass?"

438
00:26:36.171 --> 00:26:38.298
Very different. isn't it?

439
00:26:38.799 --> 00:26:39.967
- We think so.
- We think so.

440
00:26:40.467 --> 00:26:43.053
Or if you're at the top
of the Ferris wheel.

441
00:26:43.137 --> 00:26:44.179
and he says:

442
00:26:44.263 --> 00:26:47.474
"I really don't like heights."
But she says he said:

443
00:26:47.558 --> 00:26:49.601
"Wanna see a picture
of my rottweiler's balls?"

444
00:26:52.563 --> 00:26:54.773
Now you see why you need us?

445
00:26:55.315 --> 00:26:58.444
We'll be there to protect you
from vicious accusations.

446
00:26:58.527 --> 00:27:00.863
subpoenas. and defamation suits.

447
00:27:00.946 --> 00:27:03.198
- "Sub-poena"?
- Yeah. remember we're on your side.

448
00:27:03.282 --> 00:27:04.950
No matter what side that is.

449
00:27:05.034 --> 00:27:06.910
- We're Loomis.
- And Loomis.

450
00:27:06.994 --> 00:27:08.704
And we'll see you in court...

451
00:27:08.787 --> 00:27:09.830
- Ship.
- Ship.

452
00:27:15.085 --> 00:27:16.754
That's good. That was good.

453
00:27:16.837 --> 00:27:17.838
It's subtle.

454
00:27:17.921 --> 00:27:19.340
- Yeah.
- So...

455
00:27:19.423 --> 00:27:23.052
Okay. good job.
Next sketch is from Darrell.

456
00:27:23.802 --> 00:27:26.013
Thomas Crapper Jr.

457
00:27:26.096 --> 00:27:29.016
We open on a 19th century
British schoolyard.

458
00:27:29.099 --> 00:27:31.894
A group of 9-year-old children
are milling about

459
00:27:31.977 --> 00:27:35.189
and trying to figure out what they want
to do now that school is let out.

460
00:27:35.272 --> 00:27:37.149
Wanna come over to my house?

461
00:27:37.232 --> 00:27:39.443
No. Your house smells.

462
00:27:39.526 --> 00:27:40.694
How about my house?

463
00:27:41.195 --> 00:27:43.989
No. Your house smells too.

464
00:27:44.073 --> 00:27:45.824
My house doesn't smell.

465
00:27:45.908 --> 00:27:46.742
How come?

466
00:27:47.451 --> 00:27:49.244
I'm Thomas Crapper Jr.

467
00:27:49.328 --> 00:27:52.122
My father invented the flush toilet.

468
00:27:52.206 --> 00:27:54.708
Then let's go over to his house.

469
00:27:56.585 --> 00:27:58.003
All right. all right.

470
00:28:00.589 --> 00:28:02.883
All right. guys. Very funny stuff.

471
00:28:02.966 --> 00:28:04.927
Let's put together a show.

472
00:28:05.594 --> 00:28:06.720
Sex Refs.

473
00:28:07.763 --> 00:28:10.265
You guys wrote a really funny sketch.

474
00:28:10.891 --> 00:28:12.101
But...

475
00:28:12.726 --> 00:28:16.146
But what? Sarah and Roger were hilarious.

476
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:17.398
- Correct.
- I don't know.

477
00:28:17.481 --> 00:28:19.274
I don't know. Charlie. what do you think?

478
00:28:19.358 --> 00:28:23.570
Very funny idea. But a thumb
up the ass. rottweiler's balls...

479
00:28:23.654 --> 00:28:25.531
What are you talking about?
They got laughs.

480
00:28:25.614 --> 00:28:27.616
Of course they will. They always will.

481
00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:29.159
But is it the right kind of laugh?

482
00:28:29.827 --> 00:28:31.453
Because it's a very smart idea.

483
00:28:32.162 --> 00:28:33.163
Angry Librarians?

484
00:28:33.247 --> 00:28:34.456
- So funny.
- You should do it.

485
00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:35.374
I agree.

486
00:28:35.916 --> 00:28:37.251
Thomas Crapper Jr.

487
00:28:37.334 --> 00:28:38.210
Hell. no.

488
00:28:38.293 --> 00:28:41.005
Yeah. You know.
Darrell's option's coming up

489
00:28:41.088 --> 00:28:43.090
but he still hasn't gotten
a sketch on the air.

490
00:28:43.674 --> 00:28:44.758
It's not that bad.

491
00:28:46.301 --> 00:28:48.303
First of all.
if they spoke in English accents

492
00:28:48.387 --> 00:28:50.222
the way they were supposed to.

493
00:28:50.305 --> 00:28:53.475
it would've been a little bit better
but the whole thing's not framed right.

494
00:28:53.559 --> 00:28:55.602
Give him another shot.
He'll make it better.

495
00:28:59.064 --> 00:29:00.566
Listen. we hired Darrell

496
00:29:00.649 --> 00:29:04.278
because he wrote those
really funny essays for the <i>Lampoon.</i>

497
00:29:04.361 --> 00:29:06.196
I think it's a little hard
to make the leap

498
00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.282
from print to live.
that's all. It takes time.

499
00:29:08.365 --> 00:29:09.742
You think he's a good writer?

500
00:29:11.452 --> 00:29:13.495
Yeah. I think it's in there.

501
00:29:13.579 --> 00:29:15.205
But I think it needs to be encouraged.

502
00:29:15.289 --> 00:29:18.334
Listen. you guys
are a very fast crowd to run with

503
00:29:18.417 --> 00:29:22.338
and I also think that Inflection Mangler
Roger should be hit in the head

504
00:29:22.421 --> 00:29:23.922
until he says "subpoena" right.

505
00:29:24.006 --> 00:29:27.718
I mean. come on. "Sub-poena."
what is that? A very small poena?

506
00:29:27.801 --> 00:29:29.261
That's an inferior poena.

507
00:29:29.345 --> 00:29:32.556
An underground poena? I mean.
what is his problem?

508
00:29:33.557 --> 00:29:35.392
You know. but here's the thing.

509
00:29:35.684 --> 00:29:37.227
There's a music to comedy.

510
00:29:37.311 --> 00:29:39.229
There's a music.
There are notes to comedy.

511
00:29:39.313 --> 00:29:41.023
- He's out of tune.
- We're working on it.

512
00:29:41.106 --> 00:29:43.650
Keep working because it's driving me nuts.

513
00:29:43.734 --> 00:29:46.820
- All right. What's next?
- I have to go.

514
00:29:46.904 --> 00:29:50.199
- I'm sorry. I have my... Excuse me.
- Oh. right.

515
00:29:50.282 --> 00:29:52.284
- Yeah.
- Have a great time.

516
00:29:52.368 --> 00:29:53.202
Thanks.

517
00:29:54.119 --> 00:29:55.037
I wish I could go.

518
00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.331
- Hey. You got a job.
- Yeah. All right.

519
00:29:57.414 --> 00:29:58.791
- Good night.
- Good night.

520
00:29:58.874 --> 00:29:59.958
Good night.

521
00:30:00.709 --> 00:30:03.629
They're honoring Charlie

522
00:30:03.712 --> 00:30:06.173
and the whole cast
at the American Film Society

523
00:30:06.256 --> 00:30:08.592
for the 30th anniversary
of <i>Call Me Anytime.</i>

524
00:30:09.301 --> 00:30:12.388
Kevin Kline. Sharon Stone.
Barry Levinson directing.

525
00:30:12.471 --> 00:30:15.099
Such a funny movie. Have you seen it?

526
00:30:15.808 --> 00:30:16.767
Yeah. It's great.

527
00:30:18.102 --> 00:30:20.270
All right. What's up?

528
00:30:22.147 --> 00:30:23.941
Look. you know I love Charlie.

529
00:30:24.608 --> 00:30:26.652
I know he gave you
your start and everything.

530
00:30:26.735 --> 00:30:28.529
But... come on.

531
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:32.157
I just don't know what he brings
to the show anymore.

532
00:30:32.241 --> 00:30:34.243
Aside from 40 years' experience?

533
00:30:34.994 --> 00:30:37.246
And a body of work that includes shows

534
00:30:37.329 --> 00:30:39.289
that made it possible
for this show to exist?

535
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:46.588
Look. I know how you
can question Charlie's value.

536
00:30:47.297 --> 00:30:50.426
But he's really smart
and he still writes funny jokes.

537
00:30:51.176 --> 00:30:52.678
And he's my consigliere.

538
00:30:53.512 --> 00:30:56.807
When you write sketches with
a thumb up someone's ass.

539
00:30:57.474 --> 00:30:59.018
or a rottweiler's balls.

540
00:30:59.727 --> 00:31:02.479
he's the one who reminds me
what we should be putting on the air.

541
00:31:03.689 --> 00:31:07.317
Bottom-line. as long as
I am producing this show.

542
00:31:07.401 --> 00:31:08.861
Charlie will be here.

543
00:31:10.779 --> 00:31:13.073
- Okay?
- You got it.

544
00:31:13.157 --> 00:31:14.366
- All right.
- Yeah.

545
00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.994
- Let's get back to work.
- Yeah.

546
00:31:26.628 --> 00:31:27.963
Go. go.

547
00:31:30.007 --> 00:31:31.383
Close the door. close the door.

548
00:31:33.886 --> 00:31:34.845
Turn off the lights.

549
00:31:36.013 --> 00:31:37.139
Come here.

550
00:31:40.017 --> 00:31:42.686
I can't do this anymore.

551
00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:43.687
Why?

552
00:31:44.521 --> 00:31:47.441
You're married. I'm married.
I don't want anyone to get hurt.

553
00:31:47.524 --> 00:31:48.901
Well. neither do I.

554
00:31:50.277 --> 00:31:52.946
I just don't know what to do.

555
00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:55.741
But wait. wait. wait. Let's make a plan.

556
00:31:55.824 --> 00:31:59.828
Every year. we will meet
here in the Tuckmans' bathroom.

557
00:31:59.912 --> 00:32:01.413
at their Halloween party.

558
00:32:02.289 --> 00:32:05.668
- What about the Tuckmans' Christmas party?
- No. we've got to be strong.

559
00:32:10.005 --> 00:32:12.841
Hi. how are you?
Thank you all for being here.

560
00:32:12.925 --> 00:32:14.885
Good evening. I'm Bob Costas.

561
00:32:16.345 --> 00:32:19.973
Please welcome.
the director of <i>Call Me Anytime.</i>

562
00:32:20.057 --> 00:32:21.225
Barry Levinson.

563
00:32:21.308 --> 00:32:23.560
Its writer. Charlie Burnz.

564
00:32:23.644 --> 00:32:27.898
and its stars.
Kevin Kline and Sharon Stone.

565
00:32:34.863 --> 00:32:37.074
I have to say. right off the top.

566
00:32:37.157 --> 00:32:39.368
I really loved this film.

567
00:32:39.451 --> 00:32:42.037
In fact. I'm bypassing
a Mets-Astros game tonight

568
00:32:42.121 --> 00:32:44.331
just to be here. to do this instead.

569
00:32:44.415 --> 00:32:46.333
All right. so what's the
germ of all this?

570
00:32:46.417 --> 00:32:47.626
How did it all get started?

571
00:32:48.502 --> 00:32:53.841
Well. Charlie and I originally met
on <i>The Carol Burnett Show</i> ages ago.

572
00:32:53.924 --> 00:32:57.177
And he wrote a lot of very funny sketches.

573
00:32:57.803 --> 00:33:02.099
Shy guy. always called me Mr. Levinson.

574
00:33:02.182 --> 00:33:03.642
Even though we were friendly.

575
00:33:04.143 --> 00:33:09.064
All right. what happened was I read
Charlie's script and I thought:

576
00:33:09.148 --> 00:33:10.691
"Well this is a perfect film to do."

577
00:33:11.483 --> 00:33:14.737
So the next day. I get a call
from Barry and he says:

578
00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:17.906
"I just read this script. it's terrific.
You gotta read it.

579
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:19.700
The character. she's you."

580
00:33:19.783 --> 00:33:23.412
And I said. "She's completely compulsive.
she'll do anything. I'm in."

581
00:33:25.247 --> 00:33:31.170
And then the next day. he called me.
I read the script and then I was in.

582
00:33:31.253 --> 00:33:36.300
Literally three days later. we got a go.
And I called Charlie with the good news.

583
00:33:36.383 --> 00:33:39.553
And so Charlie. you get the call.
what did Barry say?

584
00:33:40.137 --> 00:33:41.138
Who?

585
00:33:41.889 --> 00:33:42.931
Mr. Levinson.

586
00:33:44.808 --> 00:33:48.645
It's so nice to see you.
Nice to... Wow.

587
00:33:48.729 --> 00:33:50.147
It's great to meet you.

588
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:54.276
I was just thrilled and shocked that...

589
00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:55.569
Mr. Levinson.

590
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:03.035
Wanted to direct my first...
This was my first screenplay.

591
00:34:03.118 --> 00:34:08.165
And that Kevin Kline was gonna play Ben.
and that... help me.

592
00:34:08.247 --> 00:34:10.209
- Meryl Streep.
- Hello.

593
00:34:11.126 --> 00:34:13.504
Was gonna play Iris.

594
00:34:13.587 --> 00:34:16.631
And I kept thinking.
if my parents were alive.

595
00:34:16.714 --> 00:34:18.425
this good news would've killed them.

596
00:34:20.218 --> 00:34:24.973
Charlie's work is... It's not just comedic.
there's a humanity to it.

597
00:34:25.057 --> 00:34:28.477
And I think it shows
people as real people.

598
00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.187
It's exceptional writing.

599
00:34:38.278 --> 00:34:41.448
Hey. old man. You were great up there.

600
00:34:41.531 --> 00:34:44.118
Hey. You were inside?

601
00:34:44.201 --> 00:34:47.413
Yeah. And I loved it. Second installment.

602
00:34:47.495 --> 00:34:50.749
It's a little light. boss.
Please don't break my thumbs.

603
00:34:51.917 --> 00:34:54.878
Well. this is a lovely surprise.

604
00:34:54.962 --> 00:34:56.504
How'd you know about this?

605
00:34:56.588 --> 00:34:57.673
My loser ex.

606
00:34:57.756 --> 00:35:00.718
I used his ticket.
You made me laugh a lot.

607
00:35:00.801 --> 00:35:01.969
I'm really sorry.

608
00:35:03.762 --> 00:35:06.724
No. I like seeing you up there.
It was so cool.

609
00:35:06.807 --> 00:35:08.642
You've done a lot of big things.

610
00:35:08.726 --> 00:35:09.810
I got lucky.

611
00:35:09.893 --> 00:35:12.521
Being good
ain't got nothing to do with luck.

612
00:35:13.272 --> 00:35:14.231
I guess.

613
00:35:16.233 --> 00:35:17.818
Why do you have birds in your hair?

614
00:35:17.901 --> 00:35:18.861
Why not?

615
00:35:19.403 --> 00:35:20.863
Shit. what time is it?

616
00:35:21.447 --> 00:35:23.115
I'm gonna be late for work.

617
00:35:23.198 --> 00:35:24.616
- I gotta go. Come with me.
- Work?

618
00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:25.784
- Yeah. Come on.
- Now?

619
00:35:25.868 --> 00:35:26.702
Yeah.

620
00:35:26.785 --> 00:35:28.120
What do you do?

621
00:35:31.957 --> 00:35:33.751
<i>Up in Harlem. at a table for two</i>

622
00:35:33.834 --> 00:35:36.587
<i>There were four of us
Me. your big feet and you</i>

623
00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:39.381
<i>From your ankles up
I say you sure look sweet</i>

624
00:35:39.465 --> 00:35:42.217
<i>But from there down
There's just too much feet!</i>

625
00:35:42.301 --> 00:35:44.011
<i>Yeah. your feet too big</i>

626
00:35:44.094 --> 00:35:46.930
<i>I don't want ya
'Cause your feet's too big</i>

627
00:35:47.014 --> 00:35:49.516
<i>I can't use ya
'Cause your feet's too big</i>

628
00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:52.019
<i>I really hate ya
'Cause your feet's too big</i>

629
00:35:52.102 --> 00:35:53.687
Your feet's too big!

630
00:35:56.523 --> 00:35:59.443
<i>Where d'ya get 'em?
Where d'ya get 'em?</i>

631
00:35:59.526 --> 00:36:01.904
<i>Your girl. she likes ya
She thinks you're nice</i>

632
00:36:01.987 --> 00:36:04.656
<i>Got what it takes to go to paradise</i>

633
00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:07.368
<i>She likes your face
Said she likes your rig</i>

634
00:36:07.451 --> 00:36:10.412
<i>But. man. oh. man
Them things are too big</i>

635
00:36:10.496 --> 00:36:11.705
<i>Your feet's too big</i>

636
00:36:11.789 --> 00:36:14.667
<i>I don't want ya
'Cause your feet's too big</i>

637
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:17.294
<i>I'm mad at ya
'Cause your feet's too big</i>

638
00:36:17.378 --> 00:36:19.880
<i>I hate ya
'Cause your feet's too big</i>

639
00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:24.218
Yeah. I come from a pretty small family.

640
00:36:25.552 --> 00:36:28.847
My mom and dad were singers.

641
00:36:28.931 --> 00:36:30.265
Mo and Jessie.

642
00:36:30.808 --> 00:36:32.726
They were kind of like
Ashford and Simpson.

643
00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:34.186
But they never made it big

644
00:36:34.269 --> 00:36:37.648
because there was already
an Ashford and Simpson.

645
00:36:38.273 --> 00:36:41.068
We used to have a lot of fun.
they thought me how to harmonize.

646
00:36:41.568 --> 00:36:45.781
and my dad made these
really cool weathervanes.

647
00:36:45.864 --> 00:36:50.119
And my mom. she had these
beautiful dreamcatchers that she makes.

648
00:36:50.202 --> 00:36:53.539
They live just outside of Charlotte.
I love them both to pieces.

649
00:36:54.081 --> 00:36:55.165
They sound great.

650
00:36:58.711 --> 00:37:01.046
I love the way
the air smells after it rains.

651
00:37:02.339 --> 00:37:06.218
Listen. if you ever need my help
with what you're going through right now.

652
00:37:06.885 --> 00:37:09.638
even if you need someone to talk to.
I'm here.

653
00:37:09.722 --> 00:37:13.100
Well. thank you very much.
But what are you talking about?

654
00:37:13.809 --> 00:37:16.186
You forgot Sharon Stone
and Barry Levinson's names?

655
00:37:16.854 --> 00:37:18.522
Oh. that. I get a little tongue tied.

656
00:37:18.605 --> 00:37:19.940
I don't like being on-stage.

657
00:37:20.024 --> 00:37:21.150
And what stage were you on

658
00:37:21.233 --> 00:37:23.652
when you wrote your family's names
under their pictures?

659
00:37:23.736 --> 00:37:25.029
I told you. that's how I work.

660
00:37:25.112 --> 00:37:27.239
It's a project that I'm working on. and...

661
00:37:27.322 --> 00:37:30.617
Look. I know what you told me.
but don't bullshit me. old man.

662
00:37:34.747 --> 00:37:36.498
It started innocently enough.

663
00:37:37.249 --> 00:37:41.337
I'd have trouble remembering things.
A name. a place. a fork.

664
00:37:42.254 --> 00:37:44.214
And I think.
"You're getting older. Charlie.

665
00:37:44.298 --> 00:37:46.050
You know. you're having senior moments."

666
00:37:46.925 --> 00:37:48.969
But one day.
I'm having lunch with this guy.

667
00:37:49.053 --> 00:37:50.846
and I can't remember his name.

668
00:37:50.929 --> 00:37:52.890
He's going on and on and on.

669
00:37:52.973 --> 00:37:54.350
I'm thinking. "Who the hell is this?"

670
00:37:54.433 --> 00:37:56.769
Then he cracks himself up
and he starts laughing.

671
00:37:56.852 --> 00:37:59.646
So I faked laughing.
Just to go along with him.

672
00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:05.069
And while I'm laughing. I'm panicking.
Thinking. "Who the hell is this?"

673
00:38:05.152 --> 00:38:06.570
Did you know him?

674
00:38:08.405 --> 00:38:09.698
He was my son.

675
00:38:13.702 --> 00:38:16.580
Yeah. It's happening.

676
00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:21.001
Jesus. old man. I'm sorry.

677
00:38:26.924 --> 00:38:27.800
Who's Carrie?

678
00:38:29.677 --> 00:38:32.721
I saw that on the title page
at your house.

679
00:38:34.723 --> 00:38:36.141
Carrie was my wife.

680
00:38:37.601 --> 00:38:38.519
She died.

681
00:38:40.437 --> 00:38:41.772
Long time ago.

682
00:38:43.941 --> 00:38:47.319
And I'm writing something for her.

683
00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:50.406
And I have to finish
before my words run out.

684
00:38:50.489 --> 00:38:52.324
When did you start working on it?

685
00:38:53.075 --> 00:38:55.077
About an hour after I was diagnosed.

686
00:38:56.078 --> 00:38:57.329
And how's it going?

687
00:38:57.413 --> 00:38:58.872
It's going really well.

688
00:38:59.665 --> 00:39:02.793
My mama would call that
a crock of lukewarm horseshit.

689
00:39:02.876 --> 00:39:04.461
Don't lie to me. old man.

690
00:39:05.045 --> 00:39:07.589
I know you haven't started
writing one single word.

691
00:39:08.674 --> 00:39:10.342
- Let me see your phone.
- My phone?

692
00:39:10.426 --> 00:39:11.635
- Your phone.
- Okay.

693
00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:14.096
Okay.

694
00:39:15.055 --> 00:39:18.767
This is my name. this is my number. okay?

695
00:39:18.851 --> 00:39:20.602
Now. even if you don't wanna contact me.

696
00:39:20.686 --> 00:39:25.649
I just want you to know that I'm not some
allergic-to-shellfish nut

697
00:39:25.733 --> 00:39:27.484
that's half your age plus four.

698
00:39:27.568 --> 00:39:29.695
that wants to help you
because you helped me.

699
00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:31.905
You don't stop for commas. do you?

700
00:39:32.614 --> 00:39:33.991
Life's too short for commas.

701
00:39:41.081 --> 00:39:43.876
Darrell. this is better.

702
00:39:44.543 --> 00:39:45.919
Try this as a tag.

703
00:39:47.087 --> 00:39:50.215
Let's do it in the dress rehearsal.
What do you think?

704
00:39:51.175 --> 00:39:53.344
Yeah. That's great.

705
00:39:53.427 --> 00:39:54.970
- Are we good?
- Yeah. Thanks.

706
00:39:55.054 --> 00:39:56.347
- Good. Alrighty.
- All right.

707
00:39:57.848 --> 00:39:59.600
Do you want to come to my house and play?

708
00:39:59.683 --> 00:40:01.852
No. your house smells.

709
00:40:02.603 --> 00:40:04.521
Then come to my house and play.

710
00:40:04.605 --> 00:40:07.399
No. your house smells too.

711
00:40:08.442 --> 00:40:11.528
My house doesn't smell. We can play there.

712
00:40:11.612 --> 00:40:13.530
Oh. he's Thomas Crapper's son.

713
00:40:13.614 --> 00:40:15.449
His father invented the flushing toilet.

714
00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:17.910
That's a lot of crap.

715
00:40:18.619 --> 00:40:20.871
Not anymore.

716
00:40:20.954 --> 00:40:22.998
Let's go to his house!

717
00:40:23.749 --> 00:40:29.046
Ah. yes. Thomas Crapper.
the father of the modern toilet.

718
00:40:29.129 --> 00:40:31.173
I'm Jeff Goldblum.

719
00:40:34.968 --> 00:40:41.016
This has been a little-known moment
in indoor plumbing history.

720
00:40:42.643 --> 00:40:46.063
Change your toilet. Change the world.

721
00:40:47.022 --> 00:40:48.941
Commercial break! Two minutes.

722
00:40:52.152 --> 00:40:53.153
Not bad.

723
00:40:53.237 --> 00:40:56.115
- Great fix. Darrell.
- The Goldblum thing was funny.

724
00:40:56.198 --> 00:40:57.074
Thanks.

725
00:40:57.157 --> 00:41:01.370
I think we'll slot it after the third
commercial break. Got one on the air.

726
00:41:01.453 --> 00:41:02.621
All right.

727
00:41:04.164 --> 00:41:06.375
Yeah. Yeah.

728
00:41:30.858 --> 00:41:32.317
<i>How did you meet Carrie?</i>

729
00:41:42.077 --> 00:41:44.997
<i>Come on. old man. How did you two meet?</i>

730
00:41:53.297 --> 00:41:55.215
Damn it. I hate this stuff.

731
00:41:56.967 --> 00:41:58.802
Hey. you know what really does the trick?

732
00:42:00.137 --> 00:42:01.138
What?

733
00:42:01.221 --> 00:42:02.097
Butter.

734
00:42:03.098 --> 00:42:05.267
- Did you just say butter?
- I'm telling you. Butter.

735
00:42:05.351 --> 00:42:08.270
No. really. There's a lot of tar
on the beach this year.

736
00:42:08.354 --> 00:42:12.399
What you do is you take a stick of butter
and just keep rubbing it into the tar

737
00:42:12.483 --> 00:42:15.903
and somehow it breaks it down.
you can just wipe it away

738
00:42:15.986 --> 00:42:18.113
and you don't have to use
that tomahawk of a shell

739
00:42:18.197 --> 00:42:20.115
that you're using
which is probably taking off

740
00:42:20.199 --> 00:42:22.076
all the epidermis
on the bottom of your foot.

741
00:42:22.785 --> 00:42:24.787
- Hi.
- Hi.

742
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:26.205
I'm Charlie Burnz.

743
00:42:26.288 --> 00:42:27.539
Hello. Charlie Burnz.

744
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:30.876
I'm Carrie.

745
00:42:30.959 --> 00:42:35.089
Carrie? Is that short for Caren
or Carina or a Catherine?

746
00:42:35.589 --> 00:42:37.716
- Florence.
- Florence?

747
00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:38.717
Don't ask.

748
00:42:39.218 --> 00:42:41.804
Florence. Well that's a great
old-fashioned name.

749
00:42:41.887 --> 00:42:44.014
That's one of the names
of one of my relatives.

750
00:42:44.098 --> 00:42:46.975
I could never imagine
my relatives as babies.

751
00:42:47.059 --> 00:42:48.477
Herman. come away from the water.

752
00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:50.688
Irving. don't put that
puppy in your mouth.

753
00:42:50.771 --> 00:42:54.358
Mildred just pooped in the toilet.
A big hand for Mildred.

754
00:42:54.942 --> 00:42:57.611
- You don't hear those names.
- That's true.

755
00:42:59.154 --> 00:43:02.908
Listen. I live in that white house.
like. right over there.

756
00:43:02.991 --> 00:43:05.911
And I happen to have
like half a ton of butter.

757
00:43:05.995 --> 00:43:07.037
So. if you...

758
00:43:07.121 --> 00:43:11.500
Yeah. I won a dairy contest.
You had to guess how much the cow weighed.

759
00:43:11.583 --> 00:43:13.961
And I can de-tar you.

760
00:43:14.044 --> 00:43:16.338
And I mean that in a very respectful way.

761
00:43:18.424 --> 00:43:19.508
Okay.

762
00:43:27.391 --> 00:43:29.059
Wow. is that a paint-by-number?

763
00:43:29.977 --> 00:43:33.355
It's you again. Hello. Charlie Burnz.

764
00:43:33.439 --> 00:43:34.523
Hey. Carrie.

765
00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:36.233
It's really good.

766
00:43:36.316 --> 00:43:37.860
- Yeah? You like it?
- Yeah.

767
00:43:37.943 --> 00:43:39.528
- You know what else I like?
- What?

768
00:43:39.611 --> 00:43:41.822
- Steamed clams.
- Oh. yeah?

769
00:43:41.905 --> 00:43:44.324
- Yeah.
- I've never had steamed clams.

770
00:43:44.408 --> 00:43:46.535
Okay. my house. 7 p.m.

771
00:43:47.995 --> 00:43:48.829
Deal.

772
00:43:50.039 --> 00:43:55.586
Here we go. Okay. take the clam.
Spread it apart. Rinse it in the broth.

773
00:43:56.170 --> 00:43:59.256
And then to the butter.
And then to your mouth.

774
00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:01.633
It's a little bit of heaven.
Isn't it great?

775
00:44:02.384 --> 00:44:04.219
Oh. God. Oh. my God. I'm so sorry.

776
00:44:04.303 --> 00:44:05.971
That's disgusting.

777
00:44:06.055 --> 00:44:08.223
- Please don't sue.
- Oh. man.

778
00:44:09.516 --> 00:44:11.352
- Pizza?
- I'll call Gino's.

779
00:44:24.948 --> 00:44:26.784
I just got this rug.

780
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:29.662
This is like tracking Bigfoot.

781
00:44:35.584 --> 00:44:36.460
Hey.

782
00:44:37.419 --> 00:44:38.420
Hey.

783
00:44:38.504 --> 00:44:39.672
Carrie.

784
00:44:40.673 --> 00:44:41.757
Good morning.

785
00:44:46.679 --> 00:44:47.554
Here.

786
00:44:49.264 --> 00:44:51.558
Good morning. Charlie Burnz.

787
00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:56.313
Here. A little something for breakfast.

788
00:44:56.939 --> 00:44:58.357
It's a beautiful day.

789
00:45:03.237 --> 00:45:04.655
Oh. God.

790
00:45:08.325 --> 00:45:09.493
Okay.

791
00:45:11.453 --> 00:45:12.788
De-tar me.

792
00:45:13.372 --> 00:45:16.208
But it seems a shame to waste
the butter on my foot.

793
00:45:17.292 --> 00:45:18.627
Come here.

794
00:45:18.711 --> 00:45:19.837
Okay.

795
00:45:22.506 --> 00:45:23.382
Hi.

796
00:45:39.565 --> 00:45:41.775
Well. hello. Old friend.

797
00:46:33.577 --> 00:46:38.999
<i>And you can't tell the depth of a well
By the length of the handle on the pump</i>

798
00:46:39.083 --> 00:46:42.544
<i>Baby. how can you tell about me?</i>

799
00:46:43.921 --> 00:46:46.423
<i>Now you can't tell a bottle by the label</i>

800
00:46:46.507 --> 00:46:48.884
<i>That's how it is with me</i>

801
00:46:48.967 --> 00:46:51.804
<i>Some folks call me a ladle.</i>

802
00:46:51.887 --> 00:46:55.724
<i>Give me a chance and you'll see</i>

803
00:46:55.808 --> 00:46:59.978
<i>You can't tell the depth of a well
By the length of the handle on the pump</i>

804
00:47:00.062 --> 00:47:00.896
Thank you. boo.

805
00:47:00.979 --> 00:47:04.650
<i>Baby. baby. baby</i>

806
00:47:04.733 --> 00:47:08.487
<i>Baby. baby
Baby. baby. baby</i>

807
00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:12.366
<i>How can you tell about me? Yeah</i>

808
00:47:12.449 --> 00:47:15.327
All right now.
make sure you make a donation.

809
00:47:16.286 --> 00:47:18.080
Thank you.
we'll see you in a few months.

810
00:47:18.163 --> 00:47:19.456
We're going on tour.

811
00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:23.544
A tour. Four months. 50 cities.
Theaters. clubs.

812
00:47:23.627 --> 00:47:25.504
- And we got a tour bus.
- Can you believe it?

813
00:47:25.587 --> 00:47:27.840
Man. it's awesome. I'm in. all the way.

814
00:47:27.923 --> 00:47:29.883
- Awesome.
- All right guys. I'll see you later.

815
00:47:29.967 --> 00:47:31.510
- See you.
- That's cool.

816
00:47:33.012 --> 00:47:34.096
You sounded great.

817
00:47:35.806 --> 00:47:36.932
What are you doing here?

818
00:47:37.016 --> 00:47:40.811
Em. I'm sorry. I messed up. Please.

819
00:47:40.894 --> 00:47:44.732
It's too late. I've moved on.
I met someone and we're in love.

820
00:47:44.815 --> 00:47:47.693
What? Already? Bullshit.

821
00:47:47.776 --> 00:47:49.695
- He's over there. Wanna meet him?
- Okay.

822
00:47:49.778 --> 00:47:51.864
Come on.
you'll see if it's some bullshit or not.

823
00:47:53.032 --> 00:47:54.658
- Hey.
- Hey. old man.

824
00:47:54.742 --> 00:47:57.745
Hi. Hey. you were great.
I mean. that was just terrific.

825
00:47:58.245 --> 00:47:59.246
What is going on here?

826
00:48:00.039 --> 00:48:04.168
Charlie. this is my ex-boyfriend.
Dwayne St. John.

827
00:48:04.793 --> 00:48:07.421
- Oh. I hear you're a fan. Thank you.
- This is your boyfriend?

828
00:48:07.504 --> 00:48:10.382
- No. he's my bae.
- You used my auction thing!

829
00:48:10.466 --> 00:48:12.551
Oh. yeah. all $22 of it.

830
00:48:12.634 --> 00:48:15.471
And thank you. It's the first day
of the rest of my life.

831
00:48:15.554 --> 00:48:16.388
Ain't that right?

832
00:48:17.222 --> 00:48:18.307
Yeah.

833
00:48:18.932 --> 00:48:22.311
- I love everything you do.
- And now he's doing me.

834
00:48:22.394 --> 00:48:24.146
Ain't that right. Charlie?

835
00:48:24.229 --> 00:48:26.190
You got that right... baby.

836
00:48:27.441 --> 00:48:28.817
We are late for lunch.

837
00:48:28.901 --> 00:48:32.571
And I would love
a seafood salad right now.

838
00:48:33.489 --> 00:48:35.824
- Okay.
- This is so crazy.

839
00:48:36.825 --> 00:48:39.244
In acting class.
I was doing the scene from your play...

840
00:48:39.328 --> 00:48:40.829
Do you wanna just take a picture?

841
00:48:41.497 --> 00:48:43.999
- Could I? Okay with you. sir?
- Sure.

842
00:48:44.083 --> 00:48:47.044
- Man. this is amazing.
- I'll take it. I know the password.

843
00:48:47.586 --> 00:48:49.129
All right. get closer.

844
00:48:50.047 --> 00:48:51.340
Okay. now. smile.

845
00:48:51.423 --> 00:48:54.134
Put your hands up in the air.
Yeah. like you won something.

846
00:48:56.261 --> 00:48:58.013
There you go. Okay.
Charlie. come up here.

847
00:48:58.097 --> 00:48:59.765
Is this good enough?

848
00:49:02.351 --> 00:49:06.480
Now you'll always remember
what me and your idol look like together.

849
00:49:06.563 --> 00:49:07.648
Bye-bye.

850
00:49:13.737 --> 00:49:15.864
- You okay?
- I will be.

851
00:49:16.699 --> 00:49:19.451
- I want some ice cream.
- Okay.

852
00:49:19.535 --> 00:49:22.079
And a triple vegan delight.

853
00:49:22.162 --> 00:49:24.415
Wow. that looks like the Olympic torch.

854
00:49:25.249 --> 00:49:26.959
Hey. I gotta change the name.

855
00:49:30.879 --> 00:49:32.506
So when would you leave?

856
00:49:33.173 --> 00:49:36.301
In like a month or so.
It's crazy how things happened.

857
00:49:36.385 --> 00:49:40.180
This record producer saw our videos and...

858
00:49:40.848 --> 00:49:43.517
he was digging us.
next thing you know. bam!

859
00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:47.146
We going on tour for four months.
on a tour bus.

860
00:49:47.229 --> 00:49:50.357
and we're already
talking about doing an album. it's...

861
00:49:50.441 --> 00:49:53.986
Charlie. I'm sorry. I'm doing all the
talking. You said something good happened?

862
00:49:54.862 --> 00:49:57.865
- I wrote last night.
- You did? That's awesome.

863
00:49:57.948 --> 00:49:59.783
It was fantastic. Just like the old days.

864
00:49:59.867 --> 00:50:02.703
Itzhak Perlman starting playing.
and I started writing.

865
00:50:03.329 --> 00:50:05.122
Izzy Perlman? Who's Izzy Perlman?

866
00:50:05.205 --> 00:50:06.623
Not Izzy Perlman.

867
00:50:06.707 --> 00:50:09.626
Izzy Pearlman
sold my parents' Venetian blinds.

868
00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:13.505
Itzhak Perlman is one
of the greatest violinists in the world.

869
00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:14.965
Ask your phone who he is!

870
00:50:15.049 --> 00:50:18.385
He lives in the building behind me
and he likes to practice at night.

871
00:50:18.469 --> 00:50:21.930
I just open my window
and it's like a free Itzhak festival.

872
00:50:22.014 --> 00:50:24.099
One of the reasons
Carrie and I bought the place.

873
00:50:30.773 --> 00:50:32.274
What was that for?

874
00:50:32.358 --> 00:50:35.277
Don't think I would've written anything
if you didn't get me started.

875
00:50:37.237 --> 00:50:39.114
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

876
00:50:42.493 --> 00:50:43.410
Hey...

877
00:50:44.203 --> 00:50:46.497
- Are you doing anything right now?
- No.

878
00:50:47.247 --> 00:50:49.917
It's my day off. Wanna have some laughs?

879
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.419
- Hell. yeah.
- Come on.

880
00:50:53.170 --> 00:50:55.964
- Wax museum?
- Trust me. it's fun.

881
00:50:56.048 --> 00:50:57.633
Don't tell me there's one of you.

882
00:50:57.716 --> 00:50:59.259
- Come on.
- Okay.

883
00:51:01.053 --> 00:51:03.639
This is Marilyn Monroe
from <i>The Seven Year Itch.</i>

884
00:51:04.306 --> 00:51:07.851
I'd be itchy too if I had
hot subway air blowing up my ass.

885
00:51:07.935 --> 00:51:09.687
Is that who I think it is?

886
00:51:10.979 --> 00:51:13.232
Hello. Dalai.

887
00:51:13.315 --> 00:51:15.651
Come on. queen. Smile. girl. Smile.

888
00:51:17.403 --> 00:51:19.488
What could he possibly be thinking?

889
00:51:21.073 --> 00:51:23.450
"Shouldn't have had the seafood salad."

890
00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:26.245
- Picasso.
- I don't dig him.

891
00:51:26.328 --> 00:51:27.204
- Why?
- Sexist.

892
00:51:27.287 --> 00:51:30.040
If I did a painting of you
with three willies. would you be happy?

893
00:51:30.124 --> 00:51:31.291
I'd be ecstatic.

894
00:51:32.668 --> 00:51:36.797
The Theory of Relativity
is never lend your relatives money.

895
00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:39.091
You can kiss that ten bucks goodbye.

896
00:51:42.052 --> 00:51:43.804
Golda. tell me again.
I don't understand.

897
00:51:43.887 --> 00:51:45.180
Okay. Mr. Arafat.

898
00:51:45.264 --> 00:51:47.725
It's "Chanukah." not "Hanukkah."

899
00:51:47.808 --> 00:51:49.351
I'm having trouble with the...

900
00:51:49.435 --> 00:51:51.353
I'm having trouble with the...!

901
00:51:51.979 --> 00:51:53.897
Pope? Party of five?

902
00:51:54.648 --> 00:51:57.735
- I am not a crook.
- Oh. bullshit. Dickie.

903
00:51:57.818 --> 00:51:59.486
Then why are you so sweaty?

904
00:52:00.029 --> 00:52:01.905
Man. he is really cross-eyed.

905
00:52:01.989 --> 00:52:05.034
That's why he didn't find
any weapons of mass destruction.

906
00:52:08.579 --> 00:52:10.289
- So you have two kids. right?
- Yeah.

907
00:52:10.372 --> 00:52:14.043
Francine teaches math
at a middle school in New Jersey.

908
00:52:14.126 --> 00:52:16.170
And my son Rex is an architect.

909
00:52:16.253 --> 00:52:18.213
And Rex is a...

910
00:52:19.048 --> 00:52:20.758
He's a pretty brilliant kid.

911
00:52:20.841 --> 00:52:24.136
He should be. He was born
at the American Museum of Natural History.

912
00:52:25.846 --> 00:52:28.140
This was so nice. Thank you.

913
00:52:31.268 --> 00:52:35.105
I wanna ask you a question.
And I'm a little nervous about it.

914
00:52:35.189 --> 00:52:38.275
because I don't remember
the last time I asked this. if ever.

915
00:52:40.819 --> 00:52:44.114
Would like to be my date
for my granddaughter's bat mitzvah?

916
00:52:44.198 --> 00:52:47.034
Her name's Lindsay
and she's the love of my life.

917
00:52:47.117 --> 00:52:48.994
And it would be
like a goodbye party for you

918
00:52:49.078 --> 00:52:51.205
except it's a bat mitzvah and not for you.

919
00:52:51.288 --> 00:52:53.707
I've never been to one before. When is it?

920
00:52:54.875 --> 00:52:57.628
- I don't remember. but soon.
- Way to narrow it down.

921
00:52:57.711 --> 00:53:01.090
- I have the invitation...
- Doesn't matter when.

922
00:53:01.173 --> 00:53:02.841
- I'd be happy to go.
- Yeah?

923
00:53:02.925 --> 00:53:04.927
- But only on one condition.
- What?

924
00:53:05.636 --> 00:53:06.804
That we dance together.

925
00:53:06.887 --> 00:53:09.598
Oh. no. no. no. You don't understand.
I'm a dangerous dancer.

926
00:53:09.682 --> 00:53:11.642
One of the few with mambo insurance.

927
00:53:11.725 --> 00:53:14.561
Oh. come on. Charlie.
It'll be so much fun.

928
00:53:15.187 --> 00:53:19.191
All right. But to be on the safe side.
wear a helmet and shoulder pads.

929
00:53:19.274 --> 00:53:21.318
- Done.
- Great.

930
00:53:49.471 --> 00:53:51.056
What's the matter. Carrie?

931
00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:53.434
I don't want the summer to be over.

932
00:53:53.517 --> 00:53:54.601
Well...

933
00:53:55.477 --> 00:53:58.230
maybe we just keep
our summer going forever.

934
00:54:00.482 --> 00:54:02.067
Good idea. Charlie Burnz.

935
00:54:24.089 --> 00:54:26.550
Stop sign... Left.

936
00:54:27.551 --> 00:54:29.928
Whoa. sorry. pal.
You can't go this way. Not safe.

937
00:54:30.012 --> 00:54:33.057
- This is the way I go.
- Sir. go this way. Not safe here.

938
00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:35.934
- I don't know that way.
- You gotta go that way.

939
00:54:36.018 --> 00:54:38.854
I don't know that way.
this is the way I go every day.

940
00:54:38.937 --> 00:54:41.315
It's a new day.
Cross the street and you'll be fine.

941
00:54:41.398 --> 00:54:44.318
- No! I have to go this way!
- Come on. Move!

942
00:54:48.072 --> 00:54:49.281
Sorry.

943
00:54:49.365 --> 00:54:51.116
What's the matter with you?

944
00:54:54.995 --> 00:54:58.749
That's the way I go. I go that way.

945
00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:06.423
What. are you crazy?
What are you doing?

946
00:55:07.049 --> 00:55:08.842
Get the hell out of the way!

947
00:55:10.177 --> 00:55:11.053
Hey!

948
00:55:11.887 --> 00:55:13.263
You. old man!

949
00:55:14.306 --> 00:55:17.935
Get the hell out of the way!
You're in the middle of the road!

950
00:55:18.727 --> 00:55:19.937
What. are you deaf?

951
00:56:00.227 --> 00:56:04.606
<i>Hey. old man! Am I crazy or did you say
your son was born in a museum?</i>

952
00:56:07.151 --> 00:56:09.737
Look at the size of this thing. honey.

953
00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:11.613
- Charlie...
- This is the only thing here

954
00:56:11.697 --> 00:56:14.408
that's bigger than you.
Look at that wishbone!

955
00:56:14.491 --> 00:56:15.784
- Charlie.
- What?

956
00:56:16.577 --> 00:56:18.245
I think my water just broke.

957
00:56:19.121 --> 00:56:22.708
We gotta get you out of here.
We gotta get you out of here.

958
00:56:25.085 --> 00:56:27.629
- I'm not gonna make it.
- Honey... I need a doctor!

959
00:56:27.713 --> 00:56:29.757
- I need a doctor!
- What's the problem?

960
00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:31.258
- My wife's having a baby.
- When?

961
00:56:31.342 --> 00:56:32.885
- Now!
- I'm gonna ask the supervisor

962
00:56:32.968 --> 00:56:34.887
- if that's okay.
- Are you kidding me?!

963
00:56:34.970 --> 00:56:36.597
- I am a doctor.
- What kind?

964
00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:38.515
- Proctologist. Okay.
- Close enough.

965
00:56:38.599 --> 00:56:40.601
Oh. God. This baby's coming fast.

966
00:56:40.684 --> 00:56:43.187
Can you do it somewhere else?
A tour group's coming through.

967
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:45.230
Really?! I have a baby coming through!

968
00:56:45.314 --> 00:56:47.524
Take a deep breath. Relax.
Call an ambulance now.

969
00:56:47.608 --> 00:56:49.485
- Copy that.
- Hi.

970
00:56:49.568 --> 00:56:52.071
- You should know my name. It's Carrie.
- Hi. Hello.

971
00:56:52.154 --> 00:56:54.698
And that man
who looks so scared is Charlie.

972
00:56:54.782 --> 00:56:57.409
- Hi. Charlie.
- He's the daddy.

973
00:56:57.493 --> 00:56:58.661
- Good.
- What's your name?

974
00:56:58.744 --> 00:57:02.581
I'm Joe Katz. Okay? Take a breath.
Relax. You're doing just great.

975
00:57:02.665 --> 00:57:05.459
Now. listen.
I'll have to remove your underwear.

976
00:57:05.542 --> 00:57:08.796
Oh. that's a bit aggressive
for our first date. don't you think?

977
00:57:08.879 --> 00:57:09.963
There we go.

978
00:57:11.048 --> 00:57:12.800
- What should I do next?
- Nothing!

979
00:57:12.883 --> 00:57:14.718
Sure? They gave us a class with the doll...

980
00:57:14.802 --> 00:57:16.387
- Leave us alone!
- Okay. Sorry.

981
00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:19.890
Charlie. This is like that time
at Rye Playland. remember?

982
00:57:19.973 --> 00:57:22.976
At the top of the Ferris wheel?
We were so drunk!

983
00:57:23.811 --> 00:57:25.479
- You okay?
- Just trying to think.

984
00:57:25.562 --> 00:57:27.981
Who took your panties off
at Rye Playland? I wasn't there.

985
00:57:28.065 --> 00:57:29.817
- What?
- It was Coney Island!

986
00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:31.860
Oh. you're right!

987
00:57:31.944 --> 00:57:34.154
- Oh. God.
- Lean forward slowly.

988
00:57:34.238 --> 00:57:36.657
And you're gonna push when I tell you.

989
00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:39.326
Carrie. you're doing great.
Hey! What are you looking at?

990
00:57:40.119 --> 00:57:42.663
- And get these scouts out of here!
- Come on. guys. Let's go.

991
00:57:42.746 --> 00:57:44.832
- Come on. boys.
- This is bullshit!

992
00:57:45.624 --> 00:57:47.668
- You too!
- Copy that. And just a reminder:

993
00:57:47.751 --> 00:57:49.712
- we close at 5.
- Get out of here!

994
00:57:50.337 --> 00:57:52.464
Okay. The baby's here. The baby's here.

995
00:57:52.548 --> 00:57:55.217
Pull a big deep breath
and a big push. okay?

996
00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:57.428
- You can do it. There you go.
- Okay.

997
00:58:05.811 --> 00:58:08.647
Okay. Here you go. Here you go.

998
00:58:08.731 --> 00:58:09.773
Here you go.

999
00:58:10.607 --> 00:58:14.069
It's a boy. It's a boy. It's a boy.

1000
00:58:16.739 --> 00:58:17.823
<i>Hey. Charlie.</i>

1001
00:58:17.906 --> 00:58:18.991
Yeah?

1002
00:58:20.367 --> 00:58:21.869
Let's name him Rex.

1003
00:58:24.705 --> 00:58:26.540
That's the perfect name.

1004
00:58:28.584 --> 00:58:31.420
I'm really glad we didn't have him
under that big whale.

1005
00:58:31.503 --> 00:58:36.675
Yeah. Because Moby Dick Burnz
would be a terrible name for our son.

1006
00:58:36.759 --> 00:58:38.886
He'd have so much trouble at school.

1007
00:58:40.471 --> 00:58:43.140
Oh. I love you. Charlie Burnz.

1008
00:58:45.642 --> 00:58:46.935
I love you too.

1009
00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:23.764
All right. Roger.
We'll cue you in five. four...

1010
00:59:23.847 --> 00:59:26.517
Three. two. one...

1011
00:59:27.059 --> 00:59:28.894
Good evening.
And welcome to another episode

1012
00:59:28.977 --> 00:59:31.355
of <i>Old People Who Have
Always Looked Old!</i>

1013
00:59:31.438 --> 00:59:34.817
Tonight's subjects are Keith Richards
and the late Mother Teresa.

1014
00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:37.069
- Oh. boy. Did you hear it?
- Yeah.

1015
00:59:37.152 --> 00:59:39.154
- How does he get away with this?
- I don't know.

1016
00:59:39.905 --> 00:59:41.073
All right. listen.

1017
00:59:42.074 --> 00:59:44.868
The sketch ideas are good.
but they don't always have to be so big.

1018
00:59:44.952 --> 00:59:47.705
Sketches can be small. more personal.

1019
00:59:47.788 --> 00:59:50.833
Something about yourself.
maybe about your girlfriend or something.

1020
00:59:50.916 --> 00:59:53.002
- That would be a problem.
- Why's that?

1021
00:59:53.085 --> 00:59:55.963
I don't have one. I'm incredibly single.

1022
00:59:56.046 --> 00:59:57.464
See? That's funny.

1023
00:59:57.548 --> 00:59:59.967
That I eat every meal alone?

1024
01:00:00.050 --> 01:00:02.469
- Oh. that's hilarious.
- No. no.

1025
01:00:02.553 --> 01:00:04.722
I'm talking
about a character for the show.

1026
01:00:04.805 --> 01:00:07.975
The incredibly single guy.
It's different than being single.

1027
01:00:08.058 --> 01:00:11.020
It's incredibly single.
There might be something funny in that.

1028
01:00:11.103 --> 01:00:12.938
- Right.
- Find out what's funny about you

1029
01:00:13.022 --> 01:00:16.233
- and then write about it.
- Okay. I'll try that.

1030
01:00:16.316 --> 01:00:19.069
- Okay.
- Can I tell you something?

1031
01:00:19.153 --> 01:00:20.029
Yeah.

1032
01:00:20.696 --> 01:00:23.115
When I was at Harvard.
I had a humor class

1033
01:00:23.198 --> 01:00:25.117
and I wrote a paper as you.

1034
01:00:26.076 --> 01:00:27.369
- Really?
- Yeah.

1035
01:00:27.453 --> 01:00:30.831
I read all your plays.
I knew your movie scripts.

1036
01:00:30.914 --> 01:00:34.668
I could even tell what jokes were yours
on whatever TV show you were writing on.

1037
01:00:34.752 --> 01:00:38.047
So I wrote a paper in your style.
Like you were at Harvard.

1038
01:00:39.173 --> 01:00:40.215
And how'd it do?

1039
01:00:41.133 --> 01:00:41.967
Got an F.

1040
01:00:43.052 --> 01:00:46.013
The professor said
we already have a great Charlie Burnz.

1041
01:00:46.096 --> 01:00:49.141
We don't have a great Darrell Green yet.
He was right.

1042
01:00:50.017 --> 01:00:54.813
Anyway. working with you
and knowing you is really special to me.

1043
01:00:54.897 --> 01:00:56.148
Oh. thank you. Darrell.

1044
01:00:56.774 --> 01:00:59.777
Listen. while I go get one of the crew

1045
01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:02.654
to vacuum out the smoke
you just blew up my ass.

1046
01:01:02.738 --> 01:01:05.949
take a whack at the incredibly single guy.
see if there's something funny.

1047
01:01:06.033 --> 01:01:08.494
- Deal.
- Good. Oh. sorry.

1048
01:01:10.412 --> 01:01:12.247
Hello? Hi.

1049
01:01:12.998 --> 01:01:14.875
Hi. yeah. No. I...

1050
01:01:16.126 --> 01:01:17.211
What to wear?

1051
01:01:18.170 --> 01:01:19.088
Oh. I don't...

1052
01:01:20.422 --> 01:01:23.384
How vintage? That's very vintage.

1053
01:01:23.467 --> 01:01:24.635
Yeah.

1054
01:01:24.718 --> 01:01:27.721
No. listen. I'm at work.
so can I call you back?

1055
01:01:28.305 --> 01:01:30.516
Okay. Bye.

1056
01:01:33.769 --> 01:01:36.814
I'm taking a date
to my granddaughter's bat mitzvah.

1057
01:01:37.398 --> 01:01:40.609
She's a... really fun person.
Never been to one before.

1058
01:01:40.693 --> 01:01:42.319
Neither have I. Can I go too?

1059
01:01:43.570 --> 01:01:46.031
I think one surprise for my family
is all they can handle.

1060
01:01:46.115 --> 01:01:48.617
And believe me.
this young woman is full of surprises.

1061
01:01:48.701 --> 01:01:50.577
- She sounds cool.
- Yeah. she is.

1062
01:01:50.661 --> 01:01:52.997
She's... She's very cool.

1063
01:01:55.499 --> 01:01:57.584
- What?
- Well...

1064
01:01:57.668 --> 01:01:58.836
you're blushing.

1065
01:01:58.919 --> 01:02:01.672
- Your face is a little red.
- Oh. that's...

1066
01:02:01.755 --> 01:02:03.590
blood pressure. Yeah.

1067
01:02:03.674 --> 01:02:05.592
Shouldn't have had the hot dog. It's...

1068
01:02:05.676 --> 01:02:07.761
- See you in a little bit.
- Bye.

1069
01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:14.018
Now that I'm a bat mitzvah girl.
I'd like to leave you with this one story.

1070
01:02:14.685 --> 01:02:17.688
So I turned to Rabbi Teplis and I said:

1071
01:02:17.771 --> 01:02:20.274
"I've been studying for years and years

1072
01:02:20.357 --> 01:02:22.693
and I ask you:
'What is the meaning of life?'

1073
01:02:22.776 --> 01:02:25.112
And you tell me life is a cookie?"

1074
01:02:28.032 --> 01:02:30.617
And Rabbi Teplis looked at me and said:

1075
01:02:30.701 --> 01:02:32.077
"You mean it isn't?"

1076
01:02:37.082 --> 01:02:39.626
So anyways. to my parents.

1077
01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:41.754
I love you so much.

1078
01:02:43.005 --> 01:02:44.798
You've given me everything I have.

1079
01:02:44.882 --> 01:02:47.468
and I wouldn't be here without you.

1080
01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:50.888
Thank you so much. I love you.

1081
01:02:51.722 --> 01:02:54.391
<i>Mazel tov!</i>

1082
01:03:01.148 --> 01:03:03.484
Let's get Lindsay up in the chair!

1083
01:03:05.736 --> 01:03:07.863
One. two. three!

1084
01:03:10.032 --> 01:03:12.159
Look out. Here comes Mom!

1085
01:03:12.242 --> 01:03:13.869
Up in the air. Francine.

1086
01:03:14.953 --> 01:03:17.998
Bend your knees. boys.
Here comes Papa Charlie!

1087
01:03:20.668 --> 01:03:22.211
Mazel tov!

1088
01:03:25.172 --> 01:03:26.256
Come on. Sit down.

1089
01:03:30.678 --> 01:03:32.638
This is amazing!

1090
01:03:32.721 --> 01:03:34.807
That's it. God. I'm converted!

1091
01:03:46.944 --> 01:03:47.778
Hi.

1092
01:03:48.696 --> 01:03:51.031
I'm Francine. I'm Lindsay's mom.

1093
01:03:51.115 --> 01:03:53.867
She is so special. You must be so proud.

1094
01:03:53.951 --> 01:03:56.245
- Yeah.
- I'm Emma. by the way.

1095
01:03:56.328 --> 01:03:57.997
- Oh. hi.
- Nice to meet you.

1096
01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:02.042
- Yes. nice to meet you.
- These spare ribs are delicious!

1097
01:04:02.126 --> 01:04:03.711
Oh. good.

1098
01:04:03.794 --> 01:04:05.921
So how long
have you been dating my father?

1099
01:04:06.005 --> 01:04:09.258
What? No. no. no. We're just friends.

1100
01:04:10.009 --> 01:04:10.843
I'm sure.

1101
01:04:10.926 --> 01:04:12.928
No. He's just really nice to me.

1102
01:04:13.679 --> 01:04:14.930
And I just love his writing.

1103
01:04:17.099 --> 01:04:19.226
Okay. So...

1104
01:04:19.309 --> 01:04:22.062
So. what do you do. Emma?
For a living. I mean.

1105
01:04:22.146 --> 01:04:23.063
I'm a singer.

1106
01:04:24.481 --> 01:04:26.567
Anything I might be familiar with?

1107
01:04:26.650 --> 01:04:27.484
No.

1108
01:04:28.068 --> 01:04:32.614
But we got a whole bunch of videos
that are blowing up on Instagram.

1109
01:04:33.657 --> 01:04:36.076
- Cool.
- You should come check us out.

1110
01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:38.454
- We perform all over the city.
- Where?

1111
01:04:39.538 --> 01:04:41.915
- Mostly underground.
- Like clubs?

1112
01:04:42.833 --> 01:04:45.502
Sometimes. but more so subway stations.

1113
01:04:45.586 --> 01:04:49.631
Like Columbus Circle.
Union Square. Penn Station.

1114
01:04:49.715 --> 01:04:52.217
You gotta check us out. You know what?

1115
01:04:52.301 --> 01:04:55.387
I'm gonna get me some more ribs
because I love meat.

1116
01:04:55.471 --> 01:04:57.681
Anything I could pet. I eat.

1117
01:05:12.279 --> 01:05:13.113
Lindsay...

1118
01:05:13.864 --> 01:05:17.868
I have to tell you how proud I am of you
that you wanted to have this bat mitzvah.

1119
01:05:18.702 --> 01:05:20.537
And I wanna give you something.

1120
01:05:25.959 --> 01:05:27.002
This...

1121
01:05:27.544 --> 01:05:29.588
This was your Grandma Carrie's.

1122
01:05:31.590 --> 01:05:32.925
And now it's yours.

1123
01:05:35.177 --> 01:05:36.637
Put your hair back.

1124
01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.180
See if I can...

1125
01:05:39.014 --> 01:05:41.058
Good. Oh. it looks perfect.

1126
01:05:41.141 --> 01:05:43.227
- It's really pretty.
- Yeah.

1127
01:05:43.894 --> 01:05:45.270
I'm giving you this...

1128
01:05:45.979 --> 01:05:48.273
because today is the first big step...

1129
01:05:49.149 --> 01:05:50.693
with so many more to come.

1130
01:05:51.819 --> 01:05:54.655
And I'll be there for you for all of that.

1131
01:05:56.281 --> 01:05:59.076
And I can't wait
to see who you're gonna become.

1132
01:06:01.203 --> 01:06:02.538
I love you.

1133
01:06:03.914 --> 01:06:04.915
I love you too.

1134
01:06:06.583 --> 01:06:07.835
Thank you. Papa.

1135
01:06:12.548 --> 01:06:16.260
Hey. Dad. by the way...
I got that job I was telling you about.

1136
01:06:17.511 --> 01:06:18.512
What job?

1137
01:06:19.638 --> 01:06:20.931
The building in Union Square.

1138
01:06:21.932 --> 01:06:24.143
Yeah. Anyway. they love my design.

1139
01:06:24.226 --> 01:06:26.812
Great. Isn't that great?

1140
01:06:26.895 --> 01:06:29.690
Good going. kid. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

1141
01:06:31.775 --> 01:06:35.279
That's great. huh?
You know. Rex is an architect.

1142
01:06:35.362 --> 01:06:38.991
I know. Anyone who's born in a museum
is bound to be smart.

1143
01:06:39.074 --> 01:06:41.994
- He told you about that?
- Yeah. he's very proud of you.

1144
01:06:44.496 --> 01:06:47.249
- And this is her first bat mitzvah.
- What do you think so far?

1145
01:06:47.333 --> 01:06:49.585
- It's okay so far.
- Just okay?

1146
01:06:49.668 --> 01:06:54.048
In the beginning. it was really hot
with the dancing and the chairs up. but-

1147
01:06:54.131 --> 01:06:57.718
All due respect to your tribe.
but it's a little dull now.

1148
01:06:57.801 --> 01:07:00.179
Well. the reading. It'll pick up again.

1149
01:07:00.262 --> 01:07:02.556
Well. why don't we do something
to help a little?

1150
01:07:02.639 --> 01:07:03.932
Where you going?

1151
01:07:04.767 --> 01:07:06.393
Dad. Dad!

1152
01:07:07.770 --> 01:07:09.355
Hey. hey. hey.

1153
01:07:09.438 --> 01:07:11.774
Do you have the instrumental for...?

1154
01:07:16.070 --> 01:07:20.032
Good evening. everybody.
My name is Emma Payge.

1155
01:07:20.115 --> 01:07:23.744
I'm a very good friend
of Papa Charlie's. and Lindsay?

1156
01:07:23.827 --> 01:07:26.497
Could you please come on down
to the dance floor?

1157
01:07:27.831 --> 01:07:31.669
This is my first time ever
coming to a bat mitzvah.

1158
01:07:31.752 --> 01:07:34.755
And I have to say.
so far. I feel so welcome.

1159
01:07:34.838 --> 01:07:36.507
I'm having such a good time.

1160
01:07:36.590 --> 01:07:38.509

If you know the words
to the song. sing along.

1163

If you don't. I wanna see you
dancing your heart out.

1164
01:07:47.017 --> 01:07:53.732
<i>Oh. come on
Come on. come on. come on</i>

1165
01:07:53.816 --> 01:08:00.572
<i>Didn't I make you feel
Like you are the only man?</i>

1166
01:08:01.699 --> 01:08:03.409
<i>Yeah. yeah</i>

1167
01:08:05.285 --> 01:08:08.998
<i>Didn't I nearly give you everything
a woman possibly can?</i>

1168
01:08:11.166 --> 01:08:16.130
<i>And each time I tell myself
That I think I've had enough</i>

1169
01:08:16.213 --> 01:08:19.090
<i>But what I'm gonna show you. baby</i>

1170
01:08:19.174 --> 01:08:21.385
<i>That a woman can be tough</i>

1171
01:08:21.468 --> 01:08:27.683
<i>Oh. come on
Come on. come on. come on</i>

1172
01:08:27.766 --> 01:08:28.976
<i>And take it!</i>

1173
01:08:29.059 --> 01:08:33.063
<i>Take another little piece
Of my heart now. baby</i>

1174
01:08:33.147 --> 01:08:34.857
<i>Oh. break it!</i>

1175
01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:38.527
<i>Break another little piece
Of my heart. yeah. darling</i>

1176
01:08:39.236 --> 01:08:40.528
<i>Oh. have a...!</i>

1177

<i>Have another little piece
Of my heart. yeah. baby</i>

1178
01:08:45.576 --> 01:08:50.873
<i>You know you got it
If it makes you feel good</i>

1179
01:08:53.334 --> 01:08:55.461
Come here. baby. Yeah.

1180
01:08:56.586 --> 01:09:00.340
<i>You're out there on the streets
All looking good</i>

1181
01:09:00.424 --> 01:09:04.219
<i>And baby. deep down in your heart
You know that ain't right</i>

1182
01:09:07.181 --> 01:09:11.934
<i>Never. never. never. never.
Never hear me when I cry</i>

1183
01:09:14.146 --> 01:09:19.026
<i>But each time I tell myself
That I can't stand the pain</i>

1184
01:09:19.108 --> 01:09:24.156
<i>When you hold me in your arms
I'll sing it once again</i>

1185
01:09:24.238 --> 01:09:28.202
- No. Dad. she's...
- She's fantastic. She's fantastic.

1186
01:09:28.285 --> 01:09:30.662
<i>...come on. come on</i>

1187
01:09:30.746 --> 01:09:31.705
<i>And take it!</i>

1188
01:09:31.789 --> 01:09:35.834
<i>Take another little piece
Of my heart. yeah. baby</i>

1189
01:09:37.878 --> 01:09:41.173
<i>Break another little piece
Of my heart. yeah. darling</i>

1190
01:09:42.007 --> 01:09:43.342
<i>Oh. have a...!</i>

1191
01:09:43.425 --> 01:09:47.345
<i>Have another little piece
Of my heart. yeah. baby</i>

1192
01:09:48.347 --> 01:09:53.477
<i>You know you got it
If it makes you feel good</i>

1193
01:09:55.688 --> 01:09:57.940
All right. I see you!

1194
01:09:59.149 --> 01:09:59.983
There you go.

1195
01:10:01.276 --> 01:10:02.111
Yeah.

1196
01:10:02.778 --> 01:10:03.612
Look here.

1197
01:10:04.154 --> 01:10:06.365
<i>I'mma need you to come on</i>

1198
01:10:06.448 --> 01:10:08.117
No. No. thank you.

1199
01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:10.703
<i>Come on. come on</i>

1200
01:10:10.786 --> 01:10:11.954
<i>And take it!</i>

1201
01:10:12.037 --> 01:10:15.666
<i>Take another little piece
Of my heart. yeah. baby</i>

1202
01:10:16.542 --> 01:10:17.710
<i>Break it!</i>

1203
01:10:17.793 --> 01:10:21.046
<i>Break another little piece
Of my heart. yeah. darling</i>

1204
01:10:23.507 --> 01:10:26.969
<i>Have another little piece
Of my heart. yeah. baby</i>

1205
01:10:28.387 --> 01:10:30.723
<i>You know you got it</i>

1206
01:10:32.016 --> 01:10:36.687
<i>If it makes you feel good</i>

1207
01:10:38.731 --> 01:10:40.607
Francine is amazing!

1208
01:10:40.691 --> 01:10:43.110
Oh. mazel tov to all of you.

1209
01:10:43.193 --> 01:10:44.862
Mazel tov.

1210
01:10:44.945 --> 01:10:49.199
You rocked that <i>shul.</i>
I mean. it was like <i>Shabbos Night Live.</i>

1211
01:10:50.743 --> 01:10:52.286
You made the whole party.

1212
01:10:52.369 --> 01:10:54.747
I think I had more fun
than your family did.

1213
01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:56.832
Why are they looking at me like that?

1214
01:10:56.915 --> 01:10:58.542
Do they not know what's going on here?

1215
01:10:59.293 --> 01:11:01.378
Actually. they don't. Emma. listen.

1216
01:11:01.462 --> 01:11:03.005
You don't know everything.

1217
01:11:03.088 --> 01:11:06.216
- I mean. there's a lot of hard feelings.
- About what?

1218
01:11:07.384 --> 01:11:10.220
Well. they both...
Well. Francine especially.

1219
01:11:10.304 --> 01:11:12.890
...think I wasn't around enough
when they were kids.

1220
01:11:12.973 --> 01:11:16.977
Which was probably true.
but I was working. like. all the time.

1221
01:11:17.061 --> 01:11:20.814
And after Carrie died.
there was a revolving door of nannies.

1222
01:11:20.898 --> 01:11:22.941
And when I was there...

1223
01:11:23.942 --> 01:11:26.779
I had trouble
giving them what they needed.

1224
01:11:27.529 --> 01:11:29.448
I mean. I just was so sad.

1225
01:11:29.531 --> 01:11:31.200
And what do they have against me?

1226
01:11:32.326 --> 01:11:34.119
Well. after she passed away...

1227
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:37.790
I didn't wanna get involved
with anybody. you know. I couldn't.

1228
01:11:37.873 --> 01:11:39.667
So I dated a lot of younger women.

1229
01:11:41.085 --> 01:11:42.878
So they probably looked at us

1230
01:11:42.961 --> 01:11:44.922
thinking there's something else
going on here.

1231
01:11:45.005 --> 01:11:46.924
I'm really sorry they upset you.

1232
01:11:48.926 --> 01:11:51.679
Ladies and gentlemen. Itzhak Perlman.

1233
01:11:52.179 --> 01:11:53.847
- That's him.
- Does he take requests?

1234
01:11:53.931 --> 01:11:56.225
Itzhak Perlman is a genius.
He doesn't take requests.

1235
01:11:56.308 --> 01:11:59.228
- You still owe me a dance.
- I danced with you. I danced the <i>horah.</i>

1236
01:11:59.311 --> 01:12:01.230
- The <i>horah</i> doesn't count.
- The <i>horah's</i> a dance.

1237
01:12:01.313 --> 01:12:04.775
You run around. they lift you up.
and you sweat in to your good clothes.

1238
01:12:04.858 --> 01:12:06.068
That's a dance.

1239
01:12:06.151 --> 01:12:08.278
Doesn't count.
Come on. Charlie. We're dancing.

1240
01:12:08.362 --> 01:12:09.905
- Come on.
- We're gonna go dance.

1241
01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:16.745
Who dances to a violin concerto?

1242
01:12:16.829 --> 01:12:17.663
We do.

1243
01:12:18.998 --> 01:12:19.832
Okay.

1244
01:12:37.141 --> 01:12:38.267
Oh. there we go.

1245
01:12:38.350 --> 01:12:40.561
Look out. Look out.

1246
01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:00.974
Where have you been?

1247
01:14:01.058 --> 01:14:03.227
- When?
- The last eight hours or so.

1248
01:14:03.310 --> 01:14:05.562
- Here.
- Just so I know. where have I been?

1249
01:14:05.646 --> 01:14:06.897
- Here.
- With you?

1250
01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:09.191
- Yeah.
- That's what I was afraid of.

1251
01:14:09.274 --> 01:14:11.402
Really? Because I thought it's nice.

1252
01:14:11.485 --> 01:14:14.571
Emma. I didn't want for this to happen.

1253
01:14:14.655 --> 01:14:16.949
I don't know what you mean
when you say "this."

1254
01:14:17.032 --> 01:14:21.036
But if the "this" you're referring to
is that "this."

1255
01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:22.413
it didn't happen.

1256
01:14:22.913 --> 01:14:26.834
I got afraid of the thunder and lightning.
and I snuck in and spooned you.

1257
01:14:26.917 --> 01:14:28.377
That's it. We just spooned.

1258
01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:29.545
That's it?

1259
01:14:30.045 --> 01:14:32.006
- That's it.
- Okay.

1260
01:14:32.089 --> 01:14:34.508
Look. you're an attractive older man.

1261
01:14:34.591 --> 01:14:38.220
but your body would not be
able to handle all these groceries.

1262
01:14:38.303 --> 01:14:41.223
I'll break your back.
It's too heavy for you.

1263
01:14:41.306 --> 01:14:43.892
Can't ride this ride.
The ride is too bumpy.

1264
01:14:43.976 --> 01:14:47.730
You might dislocate your shoulder.
then you die.

1265
01:14:47.813 --> 01:14:48.814
Can't have that.

1266
01:14:50.190 --> 01:14:53.277
Anyways. thank you
for letting me sleep here.

1267
01:14:54.611 --> 01:14:55.821
You're sweet. Charlie.

1268
01:14:55.904 --> 01:14:58.449
And you might want to think about
getting some bigger boxes.

1269
01:14:58.532 --> 01:15:02.161
Because I'm not sure they can handle
your groceries. They're just too little.

1270
01:15:03.245 --> 01:15:06.665
<i>Three. two. one. now!</i>

1271
01:15:07.666 --> 01:15:11.045
I first became incredibly single
when the fetus of my twin brother

1272
01:15:11.128 --> 01:15:13.881
left the womb a month ahead of me.
because...

1273
01:15:13.964 --> 01:15:16.050
Well. he said he'd had enough.

1274
01:15:18.052 --> 01:15:21.597
This continued when I was an infant.
when my mom refused to breastfeed me.

1275
01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:25.184
She said. "Let's take things slow.
see where this goes."

1276
01:15:26.727 --> 01:15:30.481
And now. I live in this studio apartment
where I lie awake at night

1277
01:15:30.564 --> 01:15:33.525
and fantasize about having sex
with another person.

1278
01:15:34.735 --> 01:15:37.654
Which would be fun... so I've heard.

1279
01:15:39.073 --> 01:15:42.701
And I think I'd be a pretty good lover.
Find those hard to find spots

1280
01:15:42.785 --> 01:15:44.370
that drive the women wild.

1281
01:15:45.454 --> 01:15:47.081
Because I have Google Maps.

1282
01:15:48.248 --> 01:15:50.542
"In two inches. make a left."

1283
01:15:57.091 --> 01:16:00.844
If you're also incredibly single
like me. why not give me a call?

1284
01:16:01.929 --> 01:16:02.763
If not...

1285
01:16:04.014 --> 01:16:05.474
then the wrath of my god.

1286
01:16:05.974 --> 01:16:10.145
the great god Zoomgali.
who is also incredibly single.

1287
01:16:10.229 --> 01:16:11.772
will come and find you.

1288
01:16:11.855 --> 01:16:14.692
and the sounds will color the sky.

1289
01:16:14.775 --> 01:16:17.611
and he will come after you
and your loved ones.

1290
01:16:17.695 --> 01:16:20.948
and damn you to the fires of hell!

1291
01:16:22.908 --> 01:16:23.909
So call me.

1292
01:16:27.538 --> 01:16:28.747
Killing it.

1293
01:16:30.916 --> 01:16:32.876
Clear. Commercial. Two minutes.

1294
01:16:33.544 --> 01:16:35.379
That was you. That's you. dude.

1295
01:16:36.005 --> 01:16:38.048
- Killed it!
- Thanks.

1296
01:16:38.799 --> 01:16:41.343
Oh. God.
I thought my phone was off. Sorry.

1297
01:16:41.427 --> 01:16:44.346
Hello. Yeah. I'm still at the show.
I can't talk.

1298
01:16:44.430 --> 01:16:46.515
- I found it.
- What did you find?

1299
01:16:46.598 --> 01:16:51.478
That great painting of that old house
that was hanging in the empty space.

1300
01:16:51.979 --> 01:16:54.106
It's beautiful. I rehung it.

1301
01:16:54.189 --> 01:16:55.566
You're still at my house?

1302
01:16:56.233 --> 01:16:58.027
Yeah. But I'm about to go back
to my place.

1303
01:16:58.652 --> 01:17:00.404
- Take it down.
- What?

1304
01:17:00.487 --> 01:17:03.907
- Take it down. I don't wanna see it.
- I'm sorry. I thought you misplaced it.

1305
01:17:03.991 --> 01:17:07.202
Emma. I don't wanna see it.
you understand? I just don't wanna see it.

1306
01:17:07.286 --> 01:17:09.121
- <i>Get rid of it!</i>
- Fine.

1307
01:17:11.832 --> 01:17:14.543
- New girlfriend?
- No. I don't even know.

1308
01:17:15.210 --> 01:17:17.087
Hey. you're right.

1309
01:17:17.671 --> 01:17:19.214
- He's gonna be good.
- Yeah.

1310
01:17:19.798 --> 01:17:23.469
Three. two. one. now!

1311
01:17:23.552 --> 01:17:24.511
In the world of music.

1312
01:17:24.595 --> 01:17:28.557
Lady Gaga announced she is changing
her name to "Lady Gagaga."

1313
01:17:29.099 --> 01:17:31.685
She gave no explanation for her decision.

1314
01:17:31.769 --> 01:17:34.772
According to a poll. Americans
are concerned about a new axis of evil

1315
01:17:34.855 --> 01:17:36.732
that threatens our country's democracy.

1316
01:17:36.815 --> 01:17:38.525
North Korea. ISIS.

1317
01:17:38.609 --> 01:17:40.736
and Senate Majority Leader
Mitch McConnell.

1318
01:17:46.075 --> 01:17:48.577
- Moving on.
- No. no. no.

1319
01:17:48.661 --> 01:17:50.454
Is anyone bothered by this but me?

1320
01:17:50.996 --> 01:17:53.207
Do you hear that it's wrong?

1321
01:17:53.290 --> 01:17:55.501
Your emphasis... You're an emphasis moron.

1322
01:17:57.586 --> 01:17:58.962
What is he doing?

1323
01:17:59.046 --> 01:18:00.756
Everything you say is off.

1324
01:18:00.839 --> 01:18:03.175
It's not "wi fi." it's Wi-Fi.

1325
01:18:04.218 --> 01:18:08.430
It's not "polar ice caps."
it's polar icecaps.

1326
01:18:08.514 --> 01:18:10.557
You are a comedy kamikaze.

1327
01:18:10.641 --> 01:18:12.518
Oh. wait. A "comma-kaze."

1328
01:18:12.601 --> 01:18:13.977
What the hell?

1329
01:18:14.061 --> 01:18:17.231
Anybody with a correct amount
of chromosomes...

1330
01:18:18.065 --> 01:18:21.902
would know that it's Mitch McConnell.
not "Mitch-McConnell."

1331
01:18:21.985 --> 01:18:24.071
You make it sound like
there a lot of McConnells.

1332
01:18:24.154 --> 01:18:25.114
there's only one.

1333
01:18:25.197 --> 01:18:26.490
There's no Stewie McConnell.

1334
01:18:26.573 --> 01:18:29.243
Is there a Stewie McConnell
in the house? No!

1335
01:18:29.326 --> 01:18:31.620
What the hell is going on?
Should we cut to commercial?

1336
01:18:31.704 --> 01:18:34.790
- Go to commercial?
- This is live. Just stay on it.

1337
01:18:34.873 --> 01:18:37.626
Jesus Christ.
No. I'm sorry. "Jesus. Christ."

1338
01:18:38.627 --> 01:18:41.046
Who. of course. was born in "Bethle-hem."

1339
01:18:41.714 --> 01:18:44.675
I even put in on the cue card.
because I had...

1340
01:18:44.758 --> 01:18:46.844
- You know this?
- I have no idea. No.

1341
01:18:47.386 --> 01:18:48.637
Thank you. Al. Look at this.

1342
01:18:48.721 --> 01:18:52.266
I had written the exact same size
so you would know.

1343
01:18:52.349 --> 01:18:55.102
"Mitch McConnell." not "Mitch-McConnell."

1344
01:18:55.185 --> 01:18:56.729
Mitch McConnell. you see that? Al.

1345
01:18:56.812 --> 01:18:59.148
Camera one. spin around.
Give me Al's reaction.

1346
01:18:59.231 --> 01:19:01.734
Yeah. Tell everybody.
Did I tell you that this would happen?

1347
01:19:01.817 --> 01:19:05.487
- He told me this would happen.
- Everybody. Exhibit A. Al!

1348
01:19:06.196 --> 01:19:08.407
Thank you. Al. you sweet...
Where is he going?

1349
01:19:08.490 --> 01:19:09.908
<i>Get him. Follow him.</i>

1350
01:19:10.409 --> 01:19:11.243
You.

1351
01:19:12.036 --> 01:19:14.413
Look. Look. ma'am. what does that say?

1352
01:19:14.496 --> 01:19:16.206
- "Mitch McConnell."
- Thank you very much.

1353
01:19:16.290 --> 01:19:19.043
- You. you. Stand up. What does this say?
- "Mitch McConnell."

1354
01:19:19.126 --> 01:19:21.378
- Again. I can't hear you.
- "Mitch McConnell."

1355
01:19:21.462 --> 01:19:22.629
We got a winner.

1356
01:19:23.839 --> 01:19:24.757
Dang it.

1357
01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:27.468
Take anything off the top shelf.
goddamn it.

1358
01:19:27.551 --> 01:19:29.970
Everybody. tell me. What does it say?

1359
01:19:30.054 --> 01:19:31.638
- "Mitch McConnell."
- Can't hear you.

1360
01:19:31.722 --> 01:19:33.223
- "Mitch McConnell."
- One more time.

1361
01:19:33.307 --> 01:19:34.767
- "Mitch McConnell."
- Thank you.

1362
01:19:34.850 --> 01:19:36.810
Roger. you're a very talented young guy.

1363
01:19:36.894 --> 01:19:40.147
I have to tell you. I am sick and tired
of writing jokes for you

1364
01:19:40.230 --> 01:19:42.316
and having you abuse them. you dumb turd.

1365
01:19:42.399 --> 01:19:43.317
Oh. boy.

1366
01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:44.401
Dumb turd!

1367
01:19:44.485 --> 01:19:46.904
Everybody. Dumb turd!

Stand up. Dumb turd!

01:20:05.589 --> 01:20:06.632
- Turd.
- Dumb...

1376
01:20:06.715 --> 01:20:07.716
Oh. my God.

Would you get those
damn birds out of your hair?

1385
01:20:30.948 --> 01:20:31.782
Larry!

1386
01:20:37.913 --> 01:20:41.083
Camera one.
Back to Roger and reset. Take one!

1387
01:20:41.709 --> 01:20:43.669
- Thank you. "Charlie Burnz."
- No!

1388
01:20:43.752 --> 01:20:45.170
Charlie Burnz.

1389
01:20:46.046 --> 01:20:47.589
Sorry. I'll work on it.

1390
01:20:48.215 --> 01:20:51.051
That's the news of the night...
Of the night.

1391
01:20:51.135 --> 01:20:52.803
The news of the...

1392
01:20:52.886 --> 01:20:56.348
I guess I'm a dumb turd.

1393
01:20:56.432 --> 01:20:57.599
Thank you...

1394
01:20:57.683 --> 01:20:59.018
<i>Good night.</i>

1395
01:21:00.227 --> 01:21:01.687
And we're clear!

1396
01:21:02.187 --> 01:21:03.188
What was that?

1397
01:21:03.272 --> 01:21:04.481
What was that?

1398
01:21:04.565 --> 01:21:07.317
What the hell was that?

1399
01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:10.279
Charlie. what was that?
That was hilarious.

1400
01:21:10.362 --> 01:21:11.905
The schmuck can't get a name right.

1401
01:21:11.989 --> 01:21:13.866
Really inspired idea. Charlie.

1402
01:21:13.949 --> 01:21:17.119
Oh. my God. Charlie.
That is live television.

1403
01:21:17.202 --> 01:21:19.455
Charlie. why didn't you tell me?

1404
01:21:19.538 --> 01:21:23.167
- I haven't told my kids yet.
- I bet they know now. We're live.

1405
01:21:23.667 --> 01:21:25.753
My fault. I should not
have gone back in there.

1406
01:21:25.836 --> 01:21:28.505
It's so stupid.
It's so stupid. It's my fault!

1407
01:21:28.589 --> 01:21:31.216
Stupid? What are you talking about?
Everyone loved it.

1408
01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:34.178
- When did you think of this?
- Comes to me all the time.

1409
01:21:34.261 --> 01:21:36.055
Every second. it doesn't stop.

1410
01:21:36.138 --> 01:21:38.474
That's why it's so good. It was so real.

1411
01:21:38.557 --> 01:21:40.684
Holy shit. you guys.
Twitter is blowing up.

1412
01:21:40.768 --> 01:21:41.852
They love you. Charlie.

1413
01:21:41.935 --> 01:21:44.813
They love the grumpy writer
who can't bear to see his words mangled.

1414
01:21:44.897 --> 01:21:46.190
They think you're funny. man.

1415
01:21:46.273 --> 01:21:49.360
Funny? Funny?
Saying I'll be back in a few minutes

1416
01:21:49.443 --> 01:21:52.363
and never seeing
that person again is funny?

1417
01:21:52.446 --> 01:21:54.198
- Charlie. what...?
- It's not funny!

1418
01:21:54.281 --> 01:21:55.491
How can that be funny?

<i>Are you Charlie Burnz?</i>

1420
01:21:59.953 --> 01:22:01.163

1426
01:22:19.890 --> 01:22:23.227
Nothing's wrong. It's okay.
You're all right. Charlie.

1427
01:22:24.353 --> 01:22:26.397
Hey. come back to my office.

1428
01:22:27.106 --> 01:22:29.358
Lie down for a little bit. Yeah?

1429
01:22:30.234 --> 01:22:31.735
I'm so tired.

1430
01:22:31.819 --> 01:22:33.404
It's okay. It's okay.

1431
01:22:34.405 --> 01:22:35.698
Come on.

1432
01:22:35.781 --> 01:22:37.991
- I'm really tired.
- It's all right. It's all right.

1433
01:22:40.285 --> 01:22:43.038
- Until tonight. he's been fine.
- Yeah.

1434
01:22:43.122 --> 01:22:46.000
Sometimes he's just great.
You'd never know he had a problem.

1435
01:22:47.418 --> 01:22:50.546
And then it would just hit him.
but nothing like this.

1436
01:22:50.629 --> 01:22:51.672
I had no idea.

1437
01:22:52.673 --> 01:22:54.717
- It's our secret.
- Our?

1438
01:22:55.968 --> 01:22:57.928
- Nobody else knows?
- No.

1439
01:22:58.012 --> 01:23:01.432
Well. we have a problem.
Social media is blowing up. They love it.

1440
01:23:01.515 --> 01:23:03.517
Everybody is asking. "Who is this guy?"

1441
01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:05.102
They want him back next week.

1442
01:23:05.185 --> 01:23:06.603
- I know it's gone viral.
- Yeah.

1443
01:23:06.687 --> 01:23:09.106
You know. I'm very nervous about what...

1444
01:23:09.189 --> 01:23:11.775
We need to post something right away.

1445
01:23:11.859 --> 01:23:13.360
Twitter. Instagram.

1446
01:23:13.444 --> 01:23:15.029
Sorry to interrupt. I just overheard.

1447
01:23:15.112 --> 01:23:17.990
- Darrell. come on.
- Let me do it. please.

1448
01:23:18.073 --> 01:23:19.199
I know what to say.

1449
01:23:21.368 --> 01:23:22.828
Okay. Good.

1450
01:23:23.495 --> 01:23:25.831
- I have to run it by the network.
- Okay.

1451
01:23:26.707 --> 01:23:28.959
This is Charlie's friend Emma.

1452
01:23:29.668 --> 01:23:31.211
He's Darrell. he works with Charlie.

1453
01:23:31.879 --> 01:23:33.714
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

1454
01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:35.341
I'll get started.

1455
01:23:37.968 --> 01:23:38.802
What a night.

1456
01:23:40.637 --> 01:23:43.015
Okay. Charlie. There's the car.
Go ahead and get in.

1457
01:23:43.098 --> 01:23:43.932
Okay.

1458
01:23:47.061 --> 01:23:48.771
- Thanks.
- Hey. Charlie.

1459
01:23:48.854 --> 01:23:49.688
Yeah?

1460
01:23:49.772 --> 01:23:52.649
I just wanted to say good night
and make sure you're okay.

1461
01:23:53.150 --> 01:23:54.651
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1462
01:23:54.735 --> 01:23:55.569
Hey. I...

1463
01:23:56.278 --> 01:23:57.237
I posted that:

1464
01:23:58.405 --> 01:24:01.325
"Tonight. Charlie Burnz
showed why he's a comedy legend

1465
01:24:01.408 --> 01:24:05.954
when he gave a hilarious one-time only
performance as a disgruntled writer.

1466
01:24:06.038 --> 01:24:07.581
Thank you. Charlie.

1467
01:24:07.665 --> 01:24:09.667
The crew and cast of <i>This Just In.</i>

1468
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:11.502
Hashtag "dumb turd."

1469
01:24:12.961 --> 01:24:15.589
And I put the "you" in all caps
so it's the wrong inflection.

1470
01:24:16.715 --> 01:24:17.675
Thanks. kid.

1471
01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:19.677
Good night. Charlie.

1472
01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:24.390
You know. Darrell here is gonna be
a terrific writer someday.

1473
01:24:25.766 --> 01:24:26.934
I don't know.

1474
01:24:27.017 --> 01:24:28.018
I do.

1475
01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:30.979
I'll see you. kid.

1476
01:24:33.482 --> 01:24:35.776
This is a scan of your brain in February.

1477
01:24:36.985 --> 01:24:39.154
And this is the one we just took.

1478
01:24:43.909 --> 01:24:45.411
They look the same to me.

1479
01:24:46.453 --> 01:24:48.163
Yes. but your symptoms are changing.

1480
01:24:51.166 --> 01:24:53.252
If I'm right. you may have
a form of dementia

1481
01:24:53.335 --> 01:24:55.379
called Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.

1482
01:24:58.382 --> 01:25:00.426
What do you mean if you're right?

1483
01:25:05.931 --> 01:25:09.601
Only way to get
a definitive diagnosis of CJD is...

1484
01:25:10.686 --> 01:25:12.187
post-mortem autopsy.

1485
01:25:13.272 --> 01:25:14.106
Well...

1486
01:25:15.774 --> 01:25:17.067
why don't we do that now?

1487
01:25:17.151 --> 01:25:20.154
I mean. I have a lunch
but I could cancel that.

1488
01:25:21.739 --> 01:25:23.490
What happens next?

1489
01:25:23.574 --> 01:25:26.160
There are other medications
than the ones you're on now...

1490
01:25:27.202 --> 01:25:30.205
that could slow this down a bit.

1491
01:25:30.289 --> 01:25:32.291
but before too long.

1492
01:25:38.047 --> 01:25:39.798
Before too long is how long?

1493
01:25:42.217 --> 01:25:43.385
A year. maybe.

1494
01:25:47.931 --> 01:25:50.309
You probably wanna start
thinking about a caregiver.

1495
01:25:53.228 --> 01:25:54.480
A nurse?

1496
01:25:54.563 --> 01:25:56.482
Yes. or your family.

1497
01:25:57.358 --> 01:25:59.193
- Your son and daughter.
- Well...

1498
01:26:00.152 --> 01:26:01.278
that's not happening.

1499
01:26:02.321 --> 01:26:06.200
In times like this.
you should be surrounded by loved ones.

1500
01:26:06.283 --> 01:26:09.203
or professionals
who are trained to care for you.

1501
01:26:15.501 --> 01:26:17.795
I'll do it. I'll take care of Charlie.

1502
01:26:17.878 --> 01:26:19.797
No. you can't. You're going away.

1503
01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:21.340
My plans have changed.

1504
01:26:21.423 --> 01:26:23.467
No. No. they haven't changed.

1505
01:26:23.550 --> 01:26:25.969
She's in a band and they're supposed
to go on tour.

1506
01:26:26.053 --> 01:26:28.055
- Nah. I don't need to do that.
- No. Yes. you do.

1507
01:26:28.138 --> 01:26:29.640
She does need to do that.

1508
01:26:31.392 --> 01:26:33.102
May I ask what your relationship is?

1509
01:26:33.769 --> 01:26:35.104
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

1510
01:26:35.187 --> 01:26:37.272
How long have you known each other?

1511
01:26:37.356 --> 01:26:39.900
I'm guessing about six months or so.

1512
01:26:39.983 --> 01:26:41.652
Are you boyfriend and girlfriend?

1513
01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:45.614
Are we?

1514
01:26:46.573 --> 01:26:48.993
How would you define
boyfriend and girlfriend?

1515
01:26:49.076 --> 01:26:51.787
Well. are you having sexual relations?

1516
01:26:51.870 --> 01:26:53.664
- We spooned.
- We spooned.

1517
01:26:56.291 --> 01:26:57.126
Charlie...

1518
01:26:58.127 --> 01:26:59.461
what about your kids?

1519
01:27:00.379 --> 01:27:02.631
I honestly don't know
if they've ever spooned.

1520
01:27:02.715 --> 01:27:03.799
Charlie.

1521
01:27:04.633 --> 01:27:07.594
- This is no time for jokes.
- Yes. it is.

1522
01:27:08.345 --> 01:27:10.597
It's the perfect time for jokes.
goddamn it.

1523
01:27:10.681 --> 01:27:13.642
Don't try to take away my sense of humor.
I'd rather die right now.

1524
01:27:16.061 --> 01:27:18.564
Boy. this God...
This God is a real jokester. isn't he?

1525
01:27:18.647 --> 01:27:20.357
What a really funny God.

1526
01:27:20.441 --> 01:27:23.569
"Hey. live your whole life
and you won't remember any of it."

1527
01:27:24.820 --> 01:27:25.779
Fuck you!

1528
01:27:27.156 --> 01:27:28.907
- Damn it.
- It's gonna be okay.

1529
01:27:28.991 --> 01:27:31.035
How can this be okay?

1530
01:27:31.118 --> 01:27:32.661
How can this be okay?

1531
01:27:37.541 --> 01:27:39.209
My kids don't know anything.

1532
01:27:42.046 --> 01:27:43.505
I'll tell them at the right time.

1533
01:27:44.757 --> 01:27:45.841
Charlie.

1534
01:27:48.052 --> 01:27:49.428
This is the right time.

1535
01:27:52.097 --> 01:27:53.766
You can't be alone anymore.

1536
01:27:59.646 --> 01:28:01.482
I'll take care of him till I can't.

1537
01:28:04.985 --> 01:28:06.570
I'll write you some prescriptions.

1538
01:28:08.655 --> 01:28:10.574
I'll let the two of you be alone a bit.

1539
01:28:21.752 --> 01:28:22.878
What is wrong with you?

1540
01:28:22.961 --> 01:28:25.422
- What? There's nothing wrong with me.
- You're not staying.

1541
01:28:25.506 --> 01:28:26.882
- Yes. I am.
- No. you're not.

1542
01:28:26.965 --> 01:28:30.052
You heard what the doc said.
it's over. okay?

1543
01:28:30.135 --> 01:28:32.554
That's it. Please. leave me alone!

1544
01:28:32.638 --> 01:28:34.765
- Charlie.
- Don't "Charlie" me!

1545
01:28:36.016 --> 01:28:36.850
You have a life!

1546
01:28:36.934 --> 01:28:38.936
You have your music. so run.

1547
01:28:39.019 --> 01:28:42.147
Run for the hills. kid.
It's over. I'm telling you. it's over.

1548
01:28:42.231 --> 01:28:45.651
Please. I just wanna be alone!

1549
01:28:45.734 --> 01:28:48.320
- I'm not going anywhere.
- I don't want you to stay!

1550
01:28:49.196 --> 01:28:52.616
You hear me? What are you staying for?

1551
01:28:53.575 --> 01:28:56.912
What's here?
What's gonna be left? Nothing!

1552
01:28:56.996 --> 01:28:58.622
That's not true. Charlie.

1553
01:29:00.708 --> 01:29:02.626
I'm lost. I'm...

1554
01:29:03.961 --> 01:29:06.714
Help. help. help. I'm lost.

1555
01:29:07.756 --> 01:29:10.259
I'm so... I'm so lost.

1556
01:29:11.593 --> 01:29:13.637
I'm sorry. pal. But I'm in.

1557
01:29:14.805 --> 01:29:16.724
You wanna be with a stranger?

1558
01:29:19.476 --> 01:29:21.979
Pretty soon everyone's
gonna be a stranger.

1559
01:29:22.062 --> 01:29:22.980
Not me.

1560
01:29:24.106 --> 01:29:25.566
I'm not gonna leave you.

1561
01:29:28.318 --> 01:29:29.153
Thank you.

1562
01:29:50.549 --> 01:29:51.425
Hi.

1563
01:29:52.676 --> 01:29:54.303
Whose room did this used to be?

1564
01:29:54.386 --> 01:29:55.721
Francine's.

1565
01:29:55.804 --> 01:29:57.431
That explains the chill.

1566
01:29:58.015 --> 01:29:59.183
Something wrong?

1567
01:29:59.266 --> 01:30:00.434
I can't sleep.

1568
01:30:00.517 --> 01:30:01.518
What's up?

1569
01:30:02.561 --> 01:30:05.147
- I wrote something.
- That's good.

1570
01:30:05.230 --> 01:30:07.399
- I wanna read it to you.
- Okay.

1571
01:30:07.483 --> 01:30:08.650
This is my journal.

1572
01:30:09.151 --> 01:30:11.779
I've been writing stuff
for the book in it

1573
01:30:11.862 --> 01:30:13.947
because typing
has become a problem for me.

1574
01:30:14.031 --> 01:30:15.407
I know.

1575
01:30:17.868 --> 01:30:19.328
The book is called <i>For Carrie.</i>

1576
01:30:19.953 --> 01:30:21.330
This is the dedication.

1577
01:30:21.413 --> 01:30:24.291
A writer always dedicates the book
to somebody he loves...

1578
01:30:24.375 --> 01:30:26.126
- I know what it means.
- Okay.

1579
01:30:29.213 --> 01:30:30.673
"To Emma Payge.

1580
01:30:32.049 --> 01:30:35.844
Thank you for taking my truth
and making it more interesting.

1581
01:30:36.679 --> 01:30:39.181
I kind of love you. CB."

1582
01:30:39.973 --> 01:30:42.142
I kind of love you too. old man.

1583
01:30:43.435 --> 01:30:44.269
Really?

1584
01:30:44.895 --> 01:30:46.397
Yeah. Big time.

1585
01:30:48.232 --> 01:30:49.316
Didn't see that coming.

1586
01:30:51.402 --> 01:30:52.695
You make me smile.

1587
01:30:54.238 --> 01:30:55.656
Good night.

1588
01:30:55.739 --> 01:30:56.782
Good night.

1589
01:31:04.039 --> 01:31:04.873
Hey. Emma.

1590
01:31:07.710 --> 01:31:09.586
I'm grateful to you that you're here.

1591
01:31:10.629 --> 01:31:13.173
I wanna have fun. I wanna laugh.

1592
01:31:13.257 --> 01:31:14.717
I want to not be scared.

1593
01:31:15.342 --> 01:31:18.178
And I wanna write the book.
and I wanna do all of that with you.

1594
01:31:18.262 --> 01:31:19.888
But you have to promise me something.

1595
01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:22.307
When it's time...

1596
01:31:23.976 --> 01:31:25.769
you go back out and sing.

1597
01:31:25.853 --> 01:31:27.980
You're an artist.
and that's what you should do.

1598
01:31:28.063 --> 01:31:29.231
Please. promise me.

1599
01:31:30.733 --> 01:31:31.567
I promise.

1600
01:31:32.109 --> 01:31:32.943
Good.

1601
01:31:34.945 --> 01:31:37.031
I'm a bargain for 22 bucks.
don't you think?

1602
01:31:37.656 --> 01:31:38.824
Hell. yeah.

1603
01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:42.578
- Good night.
- Good night.

1604
01:32:10.606 --> 01:32:14.068
I must've dozed off.
These new meds are making me very sleepy.

1605
01:32:14.151 --> 01:32:16.737
I haven't taken a nap
since the Carter administration.

1606
01:32:18.864 --> 01:32:20.491
- What do you have there?
- Nothing.

1607
01:32:21.617 --> 01:32:22.743
Let me see.

1608
01:32:24.203 --> 01:32:25.037
The...

1609
01:32:25.788 --> 01:32:28.999
- It's that...
- Emma. I know what it is.

1610
01:32:30.209 --> 01:32:33.962
I know you said get rid of it.
but it's just so beautiful.

1611
01:32:34.046 --> 01:32:34.880
Give it to me.

1612
01:32:47.685 --> 01:32:49.812
Carrie painted this. Yeah.

1613
01:32:50.896 --> 01:32:55.150
See. she put her name in the bushes.
See there? In the trees.

1614
01:32:58.737 --> 01:33:00.406
This is Lake Charlie.

1615
01:33:00.489 --> 01:33:02.491
Lake Charlie. Where's that?

1616
01:33:02.574 --> 01:33:06.203
That's about two hours
north of the city. Yeah.

1617
01:33:07.997 --> 01:33:10.165
Carrie gave me a lake for my birthday.

1618
01:33:10.249 --> 01:33:11.333
A lake?

1619
01:33:11.417 --> 01:33:14.044
Yeah. It was actually a pond.

1620
01:33:14.128 --> 01:33:18.048
But Pond Charlie
didn't sound as good as Lake Charlie.

1621
01:33:18.132 --> 01:33:19.008
Wait.

1622
01:33:19.675 --> 01:33:20.676
What?

1623
01:33:21.885 --> 01:33:24.847
Tell me all about Lake Charlie.

1624
01:33:26.306 --> 01:33:27.433
Okay.

1625
01:33:29.184 --> 01:33:30.769
It's my 40th birthday.

1626
01:33:30.853 --> 01:33:33.355
Happy birthday. Charlie Burnz.

1627
01:33:33.439 --> 01:33:34.857
Happy birthday. Charlie.

1628
01:33:35.441 --> 01:33:38.277
<i>We had a party outside in the garden.</i>

1629
01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:39.987
<i>And after everybody was gone...</i>

1630
01:33:40.696 --> 01:33:43.449
<i>Carrie shows me this photograph
of this woodsy area</i>

1631
01:33:43.532 --> 01:33:44.908
<i>with this beautiful lake on it.</i>

1632
01:33:44.992 --> 01:33:48.245
Happy birthday. Charlie Burnz.
This is for you.

1633
01:33:48.746 --> 01:33:51.248
For me? What is this?
What am I looking at?

1634
01:33:52.207 --> 01:33:54.376
It's called Lake Charlie.

1635
01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:55.627
Lake Charlie?

1636
01:33:55.711 --> 01:33:58.047
<i>She was always trying to get me
to stop working.</i>

1637
01:33:58.130 --> 01:34:01.884
And just be alone with her and do nothing.

1638
01:34:01.967 --> 01:34:06.055
And honestly the thought of doing nothing
terrified me. you know?

1639
01:34:07.973 --> 01:34:10.434
But I loved her so much
and it meant so much to her

1640
01:34:10.517 --> 01:34:15.064
that we'd go up there. you know.
and camp out. like. in a tent.

1641
01:34:15.147 --> 01:34:16.732
Can you imagine me in a tent?

1642
01:34:16.815 --> 01:34:21.320
<i>I mean. to me. the great outdoors
would be a lot better if it was indoors.</i>

1643
01:34:21.403 --> 01:34:23.113
Good morning!

1644
01:34:27.368 --> 01:34:31.205
That smells good.
Smells better than me.

1645
01:34:34.249 --> 01:34:36.168
Wow... Whoa! Look what you did.

1646
01:34:40.756 --> 01:34:42.174
- Hey. Charlie?
- Yeah?

1647
01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:44.635
- You know what I think?
- What?

1648
01:34:45.386 --> 01:34:48.555
- I think we need a house.
- A house?

1649
01:34:48.639 --> 01:34:49.640
Yeah.

1650
01:34:50.224 --> 01:34:51.642
The kids will love it up here.

1651
01:34:52.810 --> 01:34:55.437
- Kids?
- Didn't I tell you?

1652
01:34:57.356 --> 01:34:59.692
And that's how she told me
she was pregnant with Rex.

1653
01:35:01.193 --> 01:35:03.529
So she went looking for a house.

1654
01:35:03.612 --> 01:35:05.698
Wait. didn't you guys build a house?

1655
01:35:05.781 --> 01:35:07.616
Oh. no. that's way too easy for Carrie.

1656
01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:10.285
She scoured the countryside
then she found this little house.

1657
01:35:10.369 --> 01:35:12.621
she bought it and lifted it up.

1658
01:35:12.705 --> 01:35:15.582
put it on a flatbed truck
and she drove it to Lake Charlie.

1659
01:35:15.666 --> 01:35:18.377
Got a house. Charlie Burnz!

1660
01:35:20.421 --> 01:35:21.755
Thank you.

1661
01:35:21.839 --> 01:35:23.924
<i>So we put in a new foundation.</i>

1662
01:35:24.008 --> 01:35:26.510
<i>plopped the house down on it.
renovated it.</i>

1663
01:35:26.593 --> 01:35:29.096
<i>painted it up.
made it a little bit bigger.</i>

1664
01:35:29.179 --> 01:35:30.597
<i>It was our happy place.</i>

1665
01:35:30.681 --> 01:35:33.892
Dad. come on! Let's go play.
Daddy. come on!

1666
01:35:33.976 --> 01:35:35.019
<i>She was right.</i>

1667
01:35:35.102 --> 01:35:37.229
Daddy. come on. Are you playing or not?

1668
01:35:37.312 --> 01:35:38.856
The kids loved it.

1669
01:35:40.065 --> 01:35:42.901
Now I know why
you didn't wanna hang the picture.

1670
01:35:44.653 --> 01:35:45.779
No. you don't.

1671
01:35:48.615 --> 01:35:50.743
I'm tired. I can't talk anymore.

1672
01:35:50.826 --> 01:35:54.121
Come on. Charlie. Please?
Don't take this with you.

1673
01:35:54.997 --> 01:35:56.790
I'm not going anywhere yet.

1674
01:36:00.669 --> 01:36:05.049
Okay. My first Broadway play.
<i>It's My Time.</i>

1675
01:36:05.132 --> 01:36:06.592
{\an8}<i>opened up at the Belasco Theatre.</i>

1676
01:36:07.051 --> 01:36:10.637
{\an8}<i>Reviews were terrific. business was great.
but that wasn't enough for me.</i>

1677
01:36:10.721 --> 01:36:12.806
<i>The star was an actor named Jerry Orbach.</i>

1678
01:36:12.890 --> 01:36:15.392
<i>and there was this one speech
late in the second act.</i>

1679
01:36:15.476 --> 01:36:18.354
<i>It never landed right. It drove me crazy.</i>

1680
01:36:18.437 --> 01:36:20.898
All I wanted was one show
that was just perfect.

1681
01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:29.698
Things were tense...

1682
01:36:30.949 --> 01:36:32.409
between the two of us.

1683
01:36:33.369 --> 01:36:34.995
<i>I'd been working so much.</i>

1684
01:36:35.079 --> 01:36:36.163
What are we doing?

1685
01:36:36.246 --> 01:36:39.833
<i>I'd been on the road for four months
with the play before it came to Broadway.</i>

1686
01:36:39.917 --> 01:36:42.628
<i>And everybody was looking forward
to spending some time together</i>

1687
01:36:42.711 --> 01:36:45.005
<i>at Lake Charlie. and what was I doing?</i>

1688
01:36:45.089 --> 01:36:47.800
<i>I was rewriting a play
that was already a hit.</i>

1689
01:36:47.883 --> 01:36:50.803
Charlie. we have to go right now.

1690
01:36:51.303 --> 01:36:53.722
Jefferson will be awful.
I don't like driving in the dark.

1691
01:36:53.806 --> 01:36:56.684
My mom's got the kids there waiting.
We should have left an hour ago.

1692
01:36:56.767 --> 01:36:59.311
I had to rewrite a speech for Jerry.
It wasn't landing right.

1693
01:36:59.395 --> 01:37:01.355
Great. Okay. That's just great.

1694
01:37:01.438 --> 01:37:03.774
He's reading it.
I wanna make sure it's okay with him.

1695
01:37:03.857 --> 01:37:07.861
You wanna make sure it's okay with him?
With him? How about with me?

1696
01:37:07.945 --> 01:37:10.698
How about your kids
who you haven't seen for months?

1697
01:37:10.781 --> 01:37:12.366
You promised me. You promised us.

1698
01:37:12.449 --> 01:37:15.619
Stop yelling. Five minutes.
I promise. I'll be right in and right out.

1699
01:37:15.703 --> 01:37:18.038
- The kids are waiting.
- I understand. I'll be right out.

1700
01:37:18.122 --> 01:37:20.290
The people are in line.
the show goes up in an hour.

1701
01:37:20.374 --> 01:37:22.126
- Five minutes?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1702
01:37:22.209 --> 01:37:24.962
I know you're upset.
but I hate when you get like this.

1703
01:37:25.045 --> 01:37:28.173
If you're not back in five minutes.
I'm leaving without you.

1704
01:37:28.257 --> 01:37:32.136
I heard you. okay? I heard you.
Goddamn it.

1705
01:37:36.306 --> 01:37:40.144
<i>It took 15 minutes.
When I came out she was gone.</i>

1706
01:37:40.978 --> 01:37:46.316
<i>I was angry. So I watched the show.
that damn speech still didn't land right.</i>

1707
01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:49.278
<i>I had a couple of drinks with Jerry
and then I came back here...</i>

1708
01:37:50.988 --> 01:37:53.949
And the next thing I remember
is flashing lights.

1709
01:37:55.117 --> 01:38:00.789
And a policeman in the doorway
asking me my name over and over again.

1710
01:38:02.458 --> 01:38:05.044
And I'm thinking if I don't answer him.

1711
01:38:05.127 --> 01:38:08.380
then maybe what he's about
to tell me didn't happen.

1712
01:38:16.597 --> 01:38:20.768
He told me Carrie was driving
on this dark road right near the house.

1713
01:38:20.851 --> 01:38:22.853
She came to this fork in the road.

1714
01:38:24.104 --> 01:38:27.900
and some kid loaded on pills
driving a Jeep ran the stop sign.

1715
01:38:30.486 --> 01:38:31.945
And he hit her head-on.

1716
01:38:33.614 --> 01:38:34.907
She died instantly.

1717
01:38:36.075 --> 01:38:37.868
Kid walked away without a scratch.

1718
01:38:39.870 --> 01:38:42.748
The last time I saw that beautiful face
she was mad at me.

1719
01:38:45.501 --> 01:38:48.379
That's why I can't look
at that picture anymore.

1720
01:38:49.171 --> 01:38:52.341
It makes me remember
the one thing I want to forget.

1721
01:39:00.599 --> 01:39:01.558
I'm sorry.

1722
01:39:06.814 --> 01:39:07.940
Me too.

1723
01:39:17.032 --> 01:39:20.244
- You need anything from the store?
- Wonton soup.

1724
01:39:20.327 --> 01:39:22.788
I'd like to shampoo my hair.
It's getting a little greasy...

1725
01:39:22.871 --> 01:39:25.124
- Charlie.
- What?

1726
01:39:26.542 --> 01:39:30.379
I'm just kidding. I'm okay.
I promise. Thanks.

1727
01:39:30.462 --> 01:39:31.422
Good.

1728
01:39:31.505 --> 01:39:35.175
Hey. I was thinking. you know
what we can do some day? It could be fun.

1729
01:39:35.718 --> 01:39:39.972
Ever been to Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum?
You ever been there?

1730
01:39:40.055 --> 01:39:42.599
It's a lot of fun.
It's pretty amazing what they do.

1731
01:39:48.272 --> 01:39:50.774
Okay. Sure.

1732
01:40:09.376 --> 01:40:14.298
You're back already?
Okay. Coming. coming. coming.

1733
01:40:17.926 --> 01:40:19.678
- Hi!
- Hi.

1734
01:40:19.762 --> 01:40:22.890
Come on in. Come on in.
This is a surprise.

1735
01:40:22.973 --> 01:40:26.268
What's the matter?
You look very upset. What's wrong?

1736
01:40:26.352 --> 01:40:28.103
I had a fight with my mom.

1737
01:40:28.187 --> 01:40:29.897
She said you were
drunk and embarrassing.

1738
01:40:29.980 --> 01:40:32.483
I said you could never be.
You were funny on the show.

1739
01:40:32.566 --> 01:40:35.110
Why did she keep you away from me?
She said something awful.

1740
01:40:35.194 --> 01:40:37.529
- Does she know where you are?
- She thinks I'm at school.

1741
01:40:37.613 --> 01:40:39.156
- How did you get here?
- Uber.

1742
01:40:39.239 --> 01:40:42.159
- We should tell her you're here.
- No! She'll be so mad at me.

1743
01:40:42.242 --> 01:40:45.704
- But Lindsay...
- Please. I just have to know if it's true.

1744
01:40:45.788 --> 01:40:47.289
Is what true?

1745
01:40:49.249 --> 01:40:52.127
She said it was because of you
that I don't have a grandma.

1746
01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:54.380
She said that to you?

1747
01:40:54.463 --> 01:40:57.216
I overheard her
on the phone with Uncle Rex.

1748
01:40:59.468 --> 01:41:00.844
No. Lindsay. no.

1749
01:41:01.595 --> 01:41:02.846
Okay.

1750
01:41:06.975 --> 01:41:08.852
Lindsay never made it to school. Rex.

1751
01:41:08.936 --> 01:41:11.897
She used my Uber account
and guess where she took it to.

1752
01:41:13.399 --> 01:41:18.737
I got your wonton soup but the chef said
that you need to use extra conditioner...

1753
01:41:19.780 --> 01:41:21.073
Charlie!

1754
01:41:22.199 --> 01:41:26.120
I got some short ribs. it'll be so good.

1755
01:41:27.371 --> 01:41:28.247
Charlie?

1756
01:41:29.707 --> 01:41:32.292
Charlie? Charlie!

1757
01:41:34.294 --> 01:41:38.424
Where are you. old man?
Charlie. stop playing.

1758
01:41:38.507 --> 01:41:40.884
Hey. Where is she?

1759
01:41:40.968 --> 01:41:44.138
- How'd you get in here?
- We grew up here. Where is she?

1760
01:41:44.221 --> 01:41:45.389
- Who?
- My daughter Lindsay.

1761
01:41:45.472 --> 01:41:46.849
And our father. Where's our dad?

1762
01:41:46.932 --> 01:41:48.183
- Lindsay!
- Dad!

1763
01:41:48.267 --> 01:41:51.061
Nobody's here. I just got home myself.

1764
01:41:51.145 --> 01:41:52.896
- Home?
- Do you live here?

1765
01:41:52.980 --> 01:41:55.899
- I moved in a few days ago.
- Oh. lovely.

1766
01:41:55.983 --> 01:41:58.068
- Your dad needs me right now.
- I bet he does.

1767
01:41:59.111 --> 01:42:01.405
You might want
to rethink your attitude. Francine.

1768
01:42:01.989 --> 01:42:04.283
What is this? What is all this about?

1769
01:42:04.783 --> 01:42:06.994
Research for a project he's working on.

1770
01:42:07.077 --> 01:42:09.872
- With our names under the pictures?
- He doesn't know who we are?

1771
01:42:09.955 --> 01:42:11.040
Not all the time.

1772
01:42:12.458 --> 01:42:13.959
Your father's sick.

1773
01:42:14.710 --> 01:42:17.796
He has a form of dementia.
And it's getting worse.

1774
01:42:18.964 --> 01:42:20.549
He can't be alone anymore.

1775
01:42:21.425 --> 01:42:23.927
That's why I moved in. Francine.

1776
01:42:24.011 --> 01:42:28.599
I'm his friend. He's writing a book about
your family and I'm helping him finish it.

1777
01:42:29.725 --> 01:42:31.977
- I can't believe this.
- We had no idea.

1778
01:42:32.061 --> 01:42:34.104
Because you're too busy
being pissed at him.

1779
01:42:35.064 --> 01:42:38.317
Pretty soon before you know it.
he's not gonna know who you are.

1780
01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:39.818
But you'll remember him.

1781
01:42:40.444 --> 01:42:44.573
He's done a very good job at beating
himself up without you guys piling on.

1782
01:42:44.656 --> 01:42:46.492
You were very happy once.

1783
01:42:46.575 --> 01:42:49.203
It can happen again if you let it.

1784
01:42:50.329 --> 01:42:53.374
- How do we find them?
- I put a GPS on his phone.

1785
01:42:53.457 --> 01:42:55.292
Okay. Let me see.

1786
01:42:59.088 --> 01:43:02.132
- No. No. no. no.
- It's here. It's here.

1787
01:43:03.217 --> 01:43:05.177
Where the hell are they?

1788
01:43:05.260 --> 01:43:07.721
If she's still using my Uber account.
we can find them.

1789
01:43:31.996 --> 01:43:33.372
I cannot believe this.

1790
01:43:33.455 --> 01:43:36.625
- Hey. What's wrong?
- Longer trip than I thought.

1791
01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:39.211
You give five star. I accept nothing less.

1792
01:43:39.294 --> 01:43:40.671
Is this the best way to go?

1793
01:43:42.381 --> 01:43:43.966
This is all my fault.

1794
01:43:44.049 --> 01:43:46.260
She overheard what I said to you.
We got in a fight...

1795
01:43:46.343 --> 01:43:49.471
- She heard that?
- Yes. I know. I'm sorry. okay?

1796
01:43:49.555 --> 01:43:53.183
- What if he does something crazy?
- What's he gonna do. Francine?

1797
01:43:53.267 --> 01:43:57.855
- What's gonna happen?
- He loves Lindsay. Nothing will happen.

1798
01:43:57.938 --> 01:43:59.440
How can you be so sure?

1799
01:44:00.107 --> 01:44:01.650
I know him.

1800
01:44:09.616 --> 01:44:13.287
Papa! Where are you going? Come back!

1801
01:44:17.458 --> 01:44:21.754
- Please stop!
- Hey. what about my five stars?!

1802
01:44:25.007 --> 01:44:28.135
Oh. God! Lindsay. honey. are you okay?

1803
01:44:28.218 --> 01:44:29.887
Papa Charlie ran away!

1804
01:44:29.970 --> 01:44:32.848
He told the driver to pull over.
jumped out of the car and ran.

1805
01:44:32.931 --> 01:44:34.725
I'm scared. I'm in the woods.

1806
01:44:34.808 --> 01:44:37.644
Lindsay. don't worry. Look around.
Can you see anything?

1807
01:44:37.728 --> 01:44:38.854
I can see the road.

1808
01:44:38.937 --> 01:44:41.774
Go there. Go to the road.
We're gonna find you.

1809
01:44:49.198 --> 01:44:51.075
Mom! Mom!

1810
01:44:54.036 --> 01:44:55.287
Lindsay!

1811
01:44:56.830 --> 01:44:58.040
Sweetheart.

1812
01:45:01.168 --> 01:45:02.670
Come on. Back in the car.

1813
01:45:02.753 --> 01:45:07.091
- Oh. my God. Rex.
- I know. Let's find him.

1814
01:45:16.850 --> 01:45:18.018
Dad?

1815
01:45:18.602 --> 01:45:19.937
- Papa Charlie?
- Dad?

1816
01:45:20.020 --> 01:45:22.022
- Charlie?
- Papa Charlie?

1817
01:45:22.106 --> 01:45:25.693
No. Dad. No. Please. Dad. Dad?

1818
01:45:25.776 --> 01:45:27.444
- Charlie?
- Dad?

1819
01:45:29.697 --> 01:45:31.240
Charlie!

1820
01:45:31.323 --> 01:45:32.408
Papa Charlie!

1821
01:45:32.491 --> 01:45:34.326
Charlie!

1822
01:45:35.995 --> 01:45:39.832
- Dad! Dad!
- Charlie!

1823
01:45:39.915 --> 01:45:42.584
- Papa Charlie!
- Dad!

1824
01:45:42.668 --> 01:45:45.254
- Charlie!
- Dad!

1825
01:45:45.337 --> 01:45:47.840
Papa Charlie. where are you?

1826
01:45:53.387 --> 01:45:54.513
Charlie!

1827
01:45:56.974 --> 01:45:58.142
Charlie.

1828
01:46:02.521 --> 01:46:03.856
- Hey.
- Hey.

1829
01:46:08.068 --> 01:46:11.864
- Hey. You're okay?
- My feet are wet.

1830
01:46:11.947 --> 01:46:13.198
Mine are too.

1831
01:46:14.533 --> 01:46:16.160
Are you okay? You look so upset.

1832
01:46:16.243 --> 01:46:18.078
I'm just happy to see you.

1833
01:46:18.162 --> 01:46:19.455
Dad.

1834
01:46:22.374 --> 01:46:23.834
What are you doing here?

1835
01:46:25.044 --> 01:46:26.253
Hi.

1836
01:46:27.421 --> 01:46:31.592
I wanted to show Lindsay Lake Charlie.

1837
01:46:32.426 --> 01:46:34.136
This is our happy place.

1838
01:46:35.554 --> 01:46:37.681
See. on sunsets we stand right here.

1839
01:46:38.307 --> 01:46:44.438
And we'd watch the sun go down there
and "Bye-bye sun. Bye-bye sun."

1840
01:46:44.521 --> 01:46:45.647
Somebody would say that.

1841
01:46:45.731 --> 01:46:47.274
That was me. Dad.

1842
01:46:48.567 --> 01:46:50.819
- I said that.
- Yeah.

1843
01:46:57.076 --> 01:46:59.286
- I'm sorry about your mother.
- No.

1844
01:46:59.370 --> 01:47:02.665
- Dad. you don't have to.
- No. I have to. I have to. Rex.

1845
01:47:03.165 --> 01:47:05.542
Let me finish
because I'm running out of words.

1846
01:47:09.963 --> 01:47:12.341
Francine. I was not
the reason your mom died.

1847
01:47:14.301 --> 01:47:17.054
That kid who ran the stop sign
was the reason your mom died.

1848
01:47:18.180 --> 01:47:21.517
And I adored her so much.
I loved your mother so much.

1849
01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:23.977
And she died mad at me.

1850
01:47:26.271 --> 01:47:28.691
I can't leave here
knowing that you're mad at me too.

1851
01:47:31.026 --> 01:47:36.156
I can't undo it. I can't undo it.
There's no rewrites this time.

1852
01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:39.702
Come on. Relax. Relax your hands.

1853
01:47:40.869 --> 01:47:42.830
No more fists. Relax your hands.

1854
01:47:47.793 --> 01:47:51.338
Dad. Why didn't you tell us?

1855
01:47:53.841 --> 01:47:56.719
Because I didn't know how.

1856
01:47:59.096 --> 01:48:00.055
And I was scared.

1857
01:48:01.432 --> 01:48:02.349
Of what?

1858
01:48:03.225 --> 01:48:05.978
That maybe you wouldn't care.

1859
01:48:06.061 --> 01:48:07.354
Oh. Dad.

1860
01:48:10.315 --> 01:48:11.775
Forgive me. Please.

1861
01:48:12.943 --> 01:48:15.237
Forgive me so I could forgive myself.

1862
01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:18.073
Because the sight of
your angry eyes keeps me up at night

1863
01:48:18.157 --> 01:48:21.243
and gives me the sweats.
and there's no more time for that.

1864
01:48:21.327 --> 01:48:23.912
There's no more time. I'm here today.

1865
01:48:23.996 --> 01:48:26.123
Daddy. I'm so sorry.

1866
01:48:26.206 --> 01:48:30.919
Franny. it's okay. It's okay.
I understand. I understand.

1867
01:48:31.462 --> 01:48:35.215
- I love you. Pop.
- Is there room for me?

1868
01:48:35.299 --> 01:48:37.468
- Come here. sweetie.
- I love you too. you know?

1869
01:48:40.471 --> 01:48:42.598
Emma. Emma. Come here.

1870
01:48:47.853 --> 01:48:50.397
Oh. God. What a long time between hugs.

1871
01:49:00.866 --> 01:49:04.161
Mom was always inventing days
for the kids.

1872
01:49:04.244 --> 01:49:06.330
Kids loved "Backwards Day" the best.

1873
01:49:06.413 --> 01:49:08.791
We'd have dinner for breakfast
and breakfast for dinner.

1874
01:49:08.874 --> 01:49:10.793
No. Pop. It was "Upside-down Day."

1875
01:49:10.876 --> 01:49:14.046
God. I love that.
We would have cake for breakfast.

1876
01:49:14.129 --> 01:49:15.464
- Can we do that?
- Yeah.

1877
01:49:15.547 --> 01:49:17.633
Will you do it with us.
Papa Charlie and Emma?

1878
01:49:17.716 --> 01:49:21.637
- Absolutely.
- Anything for you. Is it upside-down day?

1879
01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:23.222
Yeah. Upside-down day.

1880
01:49:24.014 --> 01:49:25.933
I got it. Upside-down day is great.

1881
01:49:26.016 --> 01:49:28.060
- Yeah?
- This will be really good.

1882
01:49:28.143 --> 01:49:29.228
Okay.

1883
01:49:33.315 --> 01:49:37.611
Hey. Rex. tell them the story about
when Dad was barbecuing outside

1884
01:49:37.695 --> 01:49:40.114
he was making all these hot dogs
and a bear came.

1885
01:49:40.698 --> 01:49:42.449
That's a really good story.

1886
01:49:42.533 --> 01:49:48.038
- Okay. so I think it was July 4th.
- Dad loves 4th of Julys.

1887
01:49:53.002 --> 01:49:54.420
It's beautiful here.

1888
01:50:00.175 --> 01:50:01.510
Are you okay?

1889
01:50:05.889 --> 01:50:06.807
I'm here.

1890
01:50:52.353 --> 01:50:53.812
Come on. Sun's going down.

1891
01:50:55.939 --> 01:50:59.026
It's going. Come on.

1892
01:51:03.155 --> 01:51:05.699
Come on. Don't wanna miss it.
