[announcer] <i>Please welcome your host.</i>
<i>Amy Schumer.</i>

4
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.848
[cheers. applause]

5
00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:31.740
Thank you. wow!

6
00:00:31.823 --> 00:00:33.825
Thank you so much!

7
00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:40.040
I deserve this. I do. Totally.

8
00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:43.043
Please. sit. Please!

9
00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:47.464
Thank you. thank you. thank you.

10
00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:51.760
Well. if we didn't have COVID yet.
we've got it now.

11
00:00:52.677 --> 00:00:54.095
What a way to go.

12
00:00:55.346 --> 00:00:56.890
I have not had COVID yet.

13
00:00:56.973 --> 00:00:59.559
Who else?
Clap if you haven't had COVID yet.

14
00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:06.775
I love how smug everybody...
Yeah!

15
00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:10.278
And the other people just
look at you like. "Fuck you."

16
00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:15.784
But no. sorry. we haven't had it yet.
you guys. We're sorry...

17
00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:19.704
I guess God chooses he who protects.

18
00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:24.000
No. We're going to get it.
We're going to get it tonight.

19
00:01:25.627 --> 00:01:26.961
So. um...

20
00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:30.340
I don't know if you know this.
but I had a baby.

21
00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:32.592
Thank you. thank you.

22
00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:37.555
Thank you. Not bad for a year. right?
Not bad?

23
00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:42.936
It's been three...
it's been three years.

24
00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:47.982
I still haven't made a baby book
for my son.

25
00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:51.653
My mom's really trying to get me to make
a baby book. I just can't do it.

26
00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:55.198
She kept. like.
serious baby books on all of us.

27
00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:58.660
But if you think about a baby book.
it's really just. like.

28
00:01:58.743 --> 00:02:03.248
a lot of teeth. and hair.
and fingerprints.

29
00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:05.542
It's really a serial killer's log.

30
00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:11.131
She wrote one milestone down for me
that I just saw recently.

31
00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:14.134
I couldn't believe it.
that she thought this was good.

32
00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:20.390
It was. "At 24 months. Amy can now watch
up to three hours of television."

33
00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:26.354
This is a milestone she felt
she was proud of.

34
00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:31.693
My son reaches that milestone daily.
so don't worry about it.

35
00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:37.323
People are like. "How much screen time?"
I'm like "All screen time. Always."

36
00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:43.163
My mom makes scrapbooks for me.
which people hear and they go. "Aw."

37
00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:47.667
But she puts
every single thing in there.

38
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.586
Things that I have tried to avoid.

39
00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:54.924
It'll be some tabloid like.
"Amy Schumer: Pregnant. or Just Fat?"

40
00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:56.342
in the book.

41
00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:01.806
I'm like. "Did you think
I needed to remember this?" You know?

42
00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:07.020
Our son. his name is Gene.

43
00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:09.731
Yeah. he's a little cutie.

44
00:03:09.814 --> 00:03:12.859
He was named Gene
for my husband's mother.

45
00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:13.985
Jean. was her name.

46
00:03:14.068 --> 00:03:15.945
She passed away. which is so sad...

47
00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.992
but to not have a mother-in-law?

48
00:03:22.243 --> 00:03:23.870
I'm sorry!

49
00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:30.668
I obviously did something right
in a former life. I'm sorry!

50
00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:34.631
So his first name's Gene.

51
00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:37.842
and then we named him
Attell for his middle name.

52
00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:40.553
after Dave Attell.
the incredible comedian.

53
00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:43.389
Yes. He's an old family friend of mine.

54
00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:45.767
And then my husband's
last name is Fischer.

55
00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:49.479
Which is also why I'll never take
his last name.

56
00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:52.982
because I don't want to be Amy Fischer.

57
00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:57.737
Who. some of you my age know.
was the Long Island Lolita

58
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.616
who tried to kill her boyfriend's wife.
So anyway!

59
00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:05.495
So anyway. we name our son.

60
00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:08.706
and then.
about a month into being a new mom.

61
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.583
not a vulnerable time at all.

62
00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:14.462
I realize that
we have named our son

63
00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:17.757
Gene Attell.
Genital.

64
00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:23.930
Genital Fissure...

65
00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:33.022
Anyone else ever fuck up to that extent?
Probably not.

66
00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:35.358
Probably not.

67
00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:40.780
So we immediately changed
his middle name.

68
00:04:40.863 --> 00:04:44.158
I hope it's better. We changed it
to "Dingleberry." Is that good?

69
00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:46.744
Will that do well in school?

70
00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:52.375
My son just saw my lower back tattoo
for the first time.

71
00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:54.627
That's a fun conversation. right?

72
00:04:55.503 --> 00:04:58.506
He's like. "What is that?"
And I just explained to him

73
00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:00.800
"Your mom is trash."

74
00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:04.220
Okay. okay.

75
00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:11.686
I try so hard. Like. you try so hard to
be a good parent. and it's just...

76
00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:15.481
You don't get better at being a parent.
You just get so used to fucking up.

77
00:05:16.024 --> 00:05:17.650
Right? That's really what it is.

78
00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:19.652
It's just like. you get used to it.

79
00:05:20.778 --> 00:05:24.741
He's been-- I've been showing him
Disney movies. that's been a lot of fun.

80
00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:28.161
Except they're all so problematic.

81
00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:30.747
If any of you have kids and you watch
Disney movies with them.

82
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.208
before every Disney movie now.
it just says.

83
00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:35.877
uh. it says.

84
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.171
"Look. we fucked up. okay?"

85
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.132
It says. "We fucked up then.

86
00:05:41.215 --> 00:05:44.552
and now. and we're sorry.
and we're going to just leave this here.

87
00:05:44.635 --> 00:05:46.429
but it's fucked up."
And it's true.

88
00:05:47.138 --> 00:05:51.017
And I'm like. "What are they talking
about? It's <i>Peter Pan.</i>" you know?

89
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.685
So we start <i>Peter Pan.</i>

90
00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:55.938
All the indigenous people.
they show... "Oh-wo-wo". Awful.

91
00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:59.150
So fucked up. I'm like.
"This isn't good. What else?"

92
00:05:59.233 --> 00:06:01.027
All the women in these movies--

93
00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:03.821
in <i>Peter Pan.</i>
it's just these mermaids.

94
00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:06.449
Remember the mermaids?
They're all topless. but long hair.

95
00:06:06.532 --> 00:06:08.409
They all speak in a whisper.

96
00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:10.787
They're all. "Oh. Peter.

97
00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:15.124
We miss you so much. Peter.

98
00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:19.378
Oh. we're so wet. We're mermaids!"

99
00:06:23.007 --> 00:06:24.926
I'm like. "You can't watch this!"

100
00:06:27.595 --> 00:06:30.389
Don't even try
to watch <i>Jungle Book. </i>okay?

101
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.685
So I'm like. "Let's scrub forward.
let's see some of the newer ones."

102
00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:37.730
I heard <i>Tangled </i>was cute.
so we watched <i>Tangled.</i>

103
00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:41.400
And it's about Rapunzel. you know.
long blonde hair Rapunzel.

104
00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:45.988
And spoiler alert: in this movie.
if you cut Rapunzel's hair.

105
00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:47.740
something horrible happens.

106
00:06:48.616 --> 00:06:51.994
It turns brown!

107
00:06:55.164 --> 00:06:56.582
And that happens!

108
00:06:56.666 --> 00:07:02.296
Her hair gets cut.
and then she has short. brown hair!

109
00:07:03.297 --> 00:07:05.550
She's revolting!

110
00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:08.344
But even though she's hideous.

111
00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:12.181
the prince still finds a way to love her.

112
00:07:13.432 --> 00:07:14.976
Isn't that beautiful?

113
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.687
That's what I want my son
to grow up with.

114
00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:21.607
I have such a bad habit right now
when I read him books.

115
00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:23.860
which I do. because I'm a hero.

116
00:07:25.778 --> 00:07:29.657
Anytime there's like an even vaguely
blonde attractive woman in any book.

117
00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.869
I'm like. "Who does that look like?"

118
00:07:36.205 --> 00:07:40.293
Like <i>Goldilocks and the Three Bears.</i>
and I'm like. "Goldilocks. who...?

119
00:07:40.376 --> 00:07:41.961
Remind you of anyone?"

120
00:07:42.753 --> 00:07:47.175
He's like. "Mommy!"
I'm like. "Oh. my God. thank you!"

121
00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:51.512
Then he sees a bear.
he's like "Mommy!"

122
00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:54.557
I'm like. "Only when prompted. okay?"

123
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.559
All right. you guys
are such a great crowd.

124
00:07:56.642 --> 00:07:58.811
we're going to have
such a fun night together.

125
00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:00.563
[cheers. applause]

126
00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:04.400
This is really an incredible line-up
of some of my best friends

127
00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:05.526
and my favorite comedians.

128
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:07.862
and we're all here
to vent about our families.

129
00:08:07.945 --> 00:08:11.032
so we're really happy
that you're here to do that with us.

130
00:08:11.115 --> 00:08:15.620
So to kick us off. ladies and gentlemen.
please welcome Ron Funches!

131
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.748
[cheers. applause]

132
00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:19.707
Hi!

133
00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:22.126
Hi!

134
00:08:26.088 --> 00:08:27.840
Thank you!

135
00:08:28.799 --> 00:08:33.804
What a fun show. we get to talk
about families? I fucking love families.

136
00:08:35.556 --> 00:08:39.227
Oh. I'm doing real well.
My family life's going well.

137
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:43.272
I just had my year anniversary
with my wife. which is wonderful.

138
00:08:45.691 --> 00:08:46.984
Yeah.

139
00:08:47.276 --> 00:08:50.905
It's the second marriage.
so I feel like this one's going to stick.

140
00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:54.867
I recommend.
if you're in your first marriage.

141
00:08:54.951 --> 00:08:57.161
just get that one out of the way.

142
00:08:58.746 --> 00:09:01.874
You're not even in your final form yet.

143
00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:08.589
After my first marriage. I was a little
bit worried I'd be damaged goods

144
00:09:08.673 --> 00:09:12.134
and people wouldn't want me.
but it's kind of the opposite. you know?

145
00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:16.138
I knew more about myself.
I knew what I liked. what I didn't like.

146
00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:18.849
I know how good my marriage is now

147
00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:23.354
because I could base it off
of how shitty my first marriage was.

148
00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:27.984
And I'm not one of those comics
that like to talk shit about their ex.

149
00:09:28.067 --> 00:09:29.986
it's just that we were married too young.

150
00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:32.989
We didn't really trust each other.
didn't respect each other.

151
00:09:33.072 --> 00:09:35.408
She kept trying--
I was a little bit bigger then.

152
00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:37.285
and she kept trying
to dress me in clothes

153
00:09:37.368 --> 00:09:40.079
with. like. giant dogs
on them all the time.

154
00:09:41.789 --> 00:09:45.459
Or just a lot of bright floral patterns
and khaki shorts.

155
00:09:46.043 --> 00:09:49.589
Just trying to make me look
like a Black Gabriel Iglesias.

156
00:09:52.049 --> 00:09:54.927
Basically just keeping me real unfuckable.

157
00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:04.270
But my wife now.
she wants me to be cute!

158
00:10:04.353 --> 00:10:06.564
Before I leave the house.
she checks the hair.

159
00:10:06.647 --> 00:10:08.524
She makes sure I'm suited and booted.

160
00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:11.527
She wants people to want to fuck me!

161
00:10:13.738 --> 00:10:16.240
That's a good marriage!

162
00:10:18.784 --> 00:10:20.453
Thank you!

163
00:10:21.203 --> 00:10:23.956
I didn't know a marriage
could be fun like that!

164
00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:28.294
I thought it had to be a constant fight.
constant struggle.

165
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:32.256
I didn't know marriage
could just be hanging out.

166
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.216
laughing together.

167
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.594
watching <i>Seinfeld </i>all day.

168
00:10:37.553 --> 00:10:39.722
until you get your dick sucked.

169
00:10:42.183 --> 00:10:45.603
When you boil marriage down to that one
sentence. I mean. oh. my God.

170
00:10:45.686 --> 00:10:47.188
it is beautiful.

171
00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:53.653
Especially if you understand how often
I've watched <i>Seinfeld </i>all day...

172
00:10:54.987 --> 00:10:57.573
without getting my dick sucked.

173
00:10:59.283 --> 00:11:00.785
But no longer.

174
00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:05.498
Uh-uh. Now I get excited
as soon as I hear the theme song.

175
00:11:07.541 --> 00:11:10.419
Yeah. as soon as I hear that.
"Bom-buh-bom-bom-bom"

176
00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:14.215
I'm like. "Ooh. I better
go get her scrunchie!"

177
00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:26.727
A lot of you related
to that scrunchie material.

178
00:11:28.979 --> 00:11:30.815
You got to be considerate.

179
00:11:33.609 --> 00:11:36.779
My wife is a very considerate person.
that's how we fell in love.

180
00:11:36.862 --> 00:11:40.825
Before we met. I had already been married
before. I had my son already.

181
00:11:40.908 --> 00:11:43.244
And I was like.
"This is going to be my focus."

182
00:11:43.327 --> 00:11:46.122
But she came into my life
and she was such a nice person.

183
00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:51.544
She kept asking me the same question
over and over and over.

184
00:11:51.627 --> 00:11:54.296
until she wormed her way into my heart.

185
00:11:54.964 --> 00:11:57.591
And I'm going to let you know
what she asked me

186
00:11:57.675 --> 00:11:59.802
in case you need to trap a man.

187
00:12:03.222 --> 00:12:05.266
My wife kept asking me...

188
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.813
if I was drinking enough water.

189
00:12:14.316 --> 00:12:16.777
And I was like.
"We both know the answer is no."

190
00:12:18.529 --> 00:12:21.824
I think the real question here is.
"Why the fuck do you care?"

191
00:12:23.784 --> 00:12:26.287
But it was because she cared about me!

192
00:12:26.912 --> 00:12:28.998
She cared about my well-being.

193
00:12:30.082 --> 00:12:33.377
And that was off-putting to me.
I didn't like that at first.

194
00:12:34.628 --> 00:12:38.174
I was used to these Los Angeles
vampire bitches.

195
00:12:42.928 --> 00:12:44.722
But she just kept at it.

196
00:12:44.805 --> 00:12:46.682
I'd go up to take her on a date.

197
00:12:46.765 --> 00:12:48.851
I'd pick her up at her house.
ring the doorbell.

198
00:12:48.934 --> 00:12:52.104
she'd answer the door. and you know what
she would have waiting for me?

199
00:12:53.105 --> 00:12:54.982
A bottle of water!

200
00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:59.987
If I was lucky enough to get her back
to my house and spend the night.

201
00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:04.575
I'd wake up in the morning. turn over.
she'd already be gone.

202
00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:08.579
But do you know what would be laying
in her place?

203
00:13:11.665 --> 00:13:13.167
Bottle of water!

204
00:13:15.836 --> 00:13:17.546
One day it just got to me.

205
00:13:18.297 --> 00:13:20.007
and I was like. "Aw...

206
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:24.261
no bitch ever cared about my hydration!"

207
00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:30.601
After my first marriage. I didn't drink
water for five years straight.

208
00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.563
Nobody said a word.

209
00:13:35.439 --> 00:13:39.401
And I was walking around with
adult-onset jaundice. it was terrible.

210
00:13:43.364 --> 00:13:47.326
One thing I love about my wife is she came
in right away. was a great stepmom.

211
00:13:47.409 --> 00:13:50.246
Again. I'm a single father
for most of my life.

212
00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:54.250
I have a son who was diagnosed
with autism when he was two years old.

213
00:13:54.333 --> 00:13:55.751
We went through a lot of therapy.

214
00:13:55.834 --> 00:13:58.963
seizures. different issues.
and I'm very proud that he's now

215
00:13:59.046 --> 00:14:01.757
a 19-year-old
high school graduate.

216
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.926
[cheers. applause]

217
00:14:09.765 --> 00:14:11.308
Working at a grocery store.

218
00:14:12.101 --> 00:14:14.853
I worked at a grocery store when I was 19.

219
00:14:14.937 --> 00:14:16.522
a little bit before I had him.

220
00:14:17.022 --> 00:14:21.318
So I'm like. "As long as you don't knock
somebody up in the next six months.

221
00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:23.529
you're killing it!"

222
00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:29.493
He's got great discipline.
and I don't know where he got it.

223
00:14:30.494 --> 00:14:32.288
Because I never disciplined him.

224
00:14:32.788 --> 00:14:34.164
I didn't know how.

225
00:14:34.248 --> 00:14:37.167
especially having a teenager
and someone who had autism.

226
00:14:37.251 --> 00:14:40.546
I didn't know what to do. I didn't know
what was teenager-related.

227
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:42.715
I didn't know what was autism-related.

228
00:14:42.798 --> 00:14:44.592
I didn't know which of these things

229
00:14:44.675 --> 00:14:49.221
made him download sixty episodes
of <i>The Price Is Right.</i>

230
00:14:52.057 --> 00:14:53.934
But I know that's not normal.

231
00:14:57.897 --> 00:15:03.319
<i>The Price Is Right </i>is a fine show.
but it is the same damn show every day!

232
00:15:04.653 --> 00:15:10.743
I'm like. "Son. did you need to fill
the entire DVR with <i>Price Is Right?"</i>

233
00:15:11.994 --> 00:15:15.372
He's like. "Oh. I'm just trying
to keep season stats. Dad."

234
00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:18.584
I'm like. "Okay. so it's the autism."

235
00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:22.755
Carry on.

236
00:15:26.842 --> 00:15:30.638
I love watching him become an adult.
have his own likes and dislikes.

237
00:15:30.721 --> 00:15:35.309
My favorite thing in the world is I share
a Spotify account with my son.

238
00:15:36.226 --> 00:15:39.897
And at the end of the year. I get that
"Spotify Wrapped" and I love it.

239
00:15:41.023 --> 00:15:43.901
Because I get to find out what
an autistic teenager thinks

240
00:15:43.984 --> 00:15:46.695
is the hottest song of the year.

241
00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:52.534
It turns out my son's favorite song
of all of last year--

242
00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:54.328
this is an honest to God fact--

243
00:15:55.329 --> 00:15:57.581
was just the sound effect...

244
00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:00.626
of bees...

245
00:16:03.212 --> 00:16:05.422
buzzing in a meadow.

246
00:16:10.761 --> 00:16:11.971
No!

247
00:16:13.097 --> 00:16:16.183
Yeah. it's cute when
you don't live with it.

248
00:16:17.518 --> 00:16:20.729
But try coming home
to that every day.

249
00:16:20.813 --> 00:16:22.690
You can't even do normal parent stuff.

250
00:16:22.773 --> 00:16:25.818
You can't be like.
"Hey! Can you turn down this...

251
00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:32.199
delightful summer's day?"

252
00:16:35.327 --> 00:16:39.873
He's just like. "Dad. you don't understand
the music that speaks to my generation!

253
00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:44.461
You need to open your mind!
It's got a good buzz to it."

254
00:16:45.337 --> 00:16:48.007
Thank you guys for your time.
I'm Ron Funches.

255
00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:49.967
[cheers. applause]

256
00:16:50.759 --> 00:16:53.095
-Hi. Amy!
-Hi. Ron!

257
00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:54.888
-Bye!
-Good job! Bye!

258
00:16:56.849 --> 00:16:58.976
How funny is Ron Funches?

259
00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:02.771
You're such a good crowd.

260
00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:06.150
Alright. please keep that energy going.
Ladies and gentlemen.

261
00:17:06.233 --> 00:17:09.111
please welcome Ms. Jaye McBride!

262
00:17:09.194 --> 00:17:11.363
[cheers. applause]

263
00:17:16.702 --> 00:17:19.371
Alright! Thank you so much.

264
00:17:19.455 --> 00:17:21.999
Man. it is great to be out
without a mask on.

265
00:17:23.125 --> 00:17:25.878
Right?
Alright.

266
00:17:25.961 --> 00:17:30.007
I actually had a guy refuse to have sex
with me unless I wore a mask.

267
00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.095
I know. and this is
way before the pandemic.

268
00:17:38.849 --> 00:17:42.478
It wasn't even a medical mask.
it was like a Spider-Man mask.

269
00:17:43.854 --> 00:17:47.191
He's like. "I got you now. Web Slinger!"
Which...

270
00:17:48.525 --> 00:17:50.527
Well. you take what you can get. right?

271
00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:54.448
I have a tough time dating.
Y'all know I'm trans. right?

272
00:17:54.531 --> 00:17:56.658
Y'all figure that out already.
you bunch of...?

273
00:17:58.327 --> 00:18:00.788
Look at you. you bunch of L.A. detectives.

274
00:18:02.289 --> 00:18:03.874
Y'all are like. "Of course I know.

275
00:18:03.957 --> 00:18:06.293
I'm from Kansas.
not from Mars. I can tell."

276
00:18:07.628 --> 00:18:11.757
The weird thing is. I wasn't trans
before I got the vaccine.

277
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:23.393
Fucking Johnson & Johnson.
I swear to God.

278
00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:31.527
One shot. my ass.

279
00:18:34.988 --> 00:18:39.118
No. I actually transitioned 15 years ago.

280
00:18:39.201 --> 00:18:40.661
which. oh. no. thank you. but...

281
00:18:41.829 --> 00:18:45.457
No. don't clap. don't clap.
I only did it to compete in the Olympics.

282
00:18:48.752 --> 00:18:50.629
I'm no hero.

283
00:18:52.131 --> 00:18:55.676
But man. And I knew early on.
like I knew real early.

284
00:18:55.759 --> 00:18:58.595
when I was like. five.
we took the dog to the vet to get fixed.

285
00:18:58.679 --> 00:19:00.973
and I was in the back yelling.
"Do me next!"

286
00:19:09.773 --> 00:19:12.401
I was raised Irish Catholic too.
which made it tough.

287
00:19:13.193 --> 00:19:16.363
I know. right?
Like here's how Irish Catholic I am.

288
00:19:16.446 --> 00:19:18.907
My grandmother had ten kids.

289
00:19:19.408 --> 00:19:22.286
Yeah. ten.
That's a good Irish Catholic woman. right?

290
00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:28.667
And she had two miscarriages.
so she was pregnant 12 times in 16 years.

291
00:19:29.626 --> 00:19:30.711
I know. right?

292
00:19:30.794 --> 00:19:33.172
She didn't have periods.
she had commas.

293
00:19:35.757 --> 00:19:37.718
Yeah. my grandmother was old-school.
Yeah.

294
00:19:37.801 --> 00:19:38.969
Like. she was like...

295
00:19:39.052 --> 00:19:42.472
She also told me once
that she didn't believe in gay people.

296
00:19:42.973 --> 00:19:45.684
Like. that's what she said.
"I don't believe in gay people."

297
00:19:45.767 --> 00:19:49.313
Which is weird because she did believe
in angels. leprechauns. and Sasquatch.

298
00:19:53.984 --> 00:19:55.819
I have an uncle who's a priest.

299
00:19:55.903 --> 00:19:59.281
Yeah. he said to me once. he said.
"I don't ever want to watch you do comedy

300
00:19:59.364 --> 00:20:03.827
because I don't want to listen
to you talk about having sex with a man."

301
00:20:04.953 --> 00:20:06.747
So I just send him pictures.

302
00:20:10.626 --> 00:20:12.711
[cheers. applause]

303
00:20:14.755 --> 00:20:16.632
That wasn't his reaction.

304
00:20:17.466 --> 00:20:20.344
No. people always say.
"If you were raised more religiously.

305
00:20:20.427 --> 00:20:22.054
you would have turned out normal."

306
00:20:24.097 --> 00:20:26.266
I'm like. "Honey. I was an altar boy.

307
00:20:28.435 --> 00:20:29.811
And I loved it!"

308
00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:39.196
Oh. no. the priest never touched me.
or hit on me. or molested me.

309
00:20:39.947 --> 00:20:41.949
And I tried everything. too.

310
00:20:48.038 --> 00:20:52.125
I was like. "Father. this confessional
is too hot for pants!"

311
00:20:59.633 --> 00:21:03.345
My dad thought that being an altar boy
would turn me into a man.

312
00:21:03.428 --> 00:21:08.350
but apparently sitting around in a dress
drinking wine all day didn't do the job!

313
00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:14.064
Yeah. my dad wasn't a fan
of this whole thing.

314
00:21:14.147 --> 00:21:15.857
I remember when I was little. I was like.

315
00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:19.236
"Dad. what do you call a little boy
who wants to be a little girl?"

316
00:21:19.903 --> 00:21:23.615
He said. "I don't know. but they're
definitely not getting any ice cream!"

317
00:21:27.911 --> 00:21:30.330
Terrible. right?
Don't worry. he dies in the end.

318
00:21:37.921 --> 00:21:41.383
Wow. some of you either love dark humor
or you hate your dad. I don't know.

319
00:21:44.428 --> 00:21:47.097
My dad died around Christmas time.
which was tough.

320
00:21:47.639 --> 00:21:50.976
I didn't know what to ask for because
I already got what I wanted!

321
00:21:59.401 --> 00:22:01.611
So I'm in therapy.

322
00:22:10.245 --> 00:22:11.955
Alright. thank you. I guess.

323
00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:14.583
No. I'm in therapy.

324
00:22:14.666 --> 00:22:18.420
I've really been talking to my therapist
a lot about my mom.

325
00:22:18.503 --> 00:22:19.671
My mom passed away and--

326
00:22:19.755 --> 00:22:21.673
I know. you're like.
"Aw. dead mom. dead dad.

327
00:22:21.757 --> 00:22:24.051
What next. Little Orphan Tranny?"

328
00:22:29.056 --> 00:22:31.725
We are talking about my mom a lot.
Like. my mom was great.

329
00:22:31.808 --> 00:22:34.811
My therapist said I should talk
to my mom every day. you know.

330
00:22:34.895 --> 00:22:37.272
which seems a little... crazy.

331
00:22:37.355 --> 00:22:39.566
so I just talk
to the mannequin in the attic

332
00:22:39.649 --> 00:22:41.318
I dressed up in her clothes.

333
00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:46.573
But she was great.
My mom was great.

334
00:22:46.656 --> 00:22:48.742
She was like this Martha Stewart-type.
you know?

335
00:22:48.825 --> 00:22:50.702
A convicted felon who could cook.

336
00:22:55.207 --> 00:22:59.711
And when I first came out to her as trans.
it sort of took her a while.

337
00:22:59.795 --> 00:23:03.548
She said she had to pray to God
after I told her.

338
00:23:03.632 --> 00:23:06.259
Which makes sense. because if you're
a middle-aged white woman

339
00:23:06.343 --> 00:23:09.387
and you don't like something.
you talk to the manager.

340
00:23:14.059 --> 00:23:16.478
Hit a little close to home. huh. L.A.?

341
00:23:22.359 --> 00:23:24.569
No. I still try to please my mom.

342
00:23:24.653 --> 00:23:27.864
After she passed away. I thought.
I'm going to do something nice.

343
00:23:27.948 --> 00:23:30.784
So I decided I was going to spread
her remains in her favorite place:

344
00:23:30.867 --> 00:23:33.370
the town I grew up in.
it's a town called Westport. New York.

345
00:23:33.453 --> 00:23:36.706
It's in the Adirondack Mountains.
it's on Lake Champlain.

346
00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:39.042
Don't clap. you're not from there.

347
00:23:41.211 --> 00:23:44.131
But it's beautiful. I drive six hours
and start to spread her remains.

348
00:23:44.214 --> 00:23:47.592
Someone comes running out and says.
"Stop. you can't do that!"

349
00:23:47.676 --> 00:23:49.261
And I'm like. "Why not?"

350
00:23:49.344 --> 00:23:52.222
He said. "You have to cremate her first."

351
00:24:05.569 --> 00:24:08.446
So then I had to put her
back in the garbage bag.

352
00:24:11.908 --> 00:24:14.452
So she's at her second favorite place.

353
00:24:15.996 --> 00:24:17.289
Behind an Arby's.

354
00:24:19.207 --> 00:24:21.585
That's why I'm late tonight. and...

355
00:24:24.296 --> 00:24:25.463
I have three brothers.

356
00:24:25.547 --> 00:24:28.675
It was weird with three brothers.
like our parents were kind of cheap.

357
00:24:28.758 --> 00:24:31.636
so when they ran the bath water.
they did it once.

358
00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.431
And we all had to share.
one right after another. right?

359
00:24:34.514 --> 00:24:35.348
Oh. it's the worst.

360
00:24:35.432 --> 00:24:38.560
If you're the last one.
it's like the Hudson River at low tide.

361
00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:45.817
And I'm in there.
and I'm looking down one day.

362
00:24:45.901 --> 00:24:47.777
and I'm thinking.
"This is disgusting.

363
00:24:48.862 --> 00:24:50.989
I'm 32 years old..."

364
00:24:57.787 --> 00:25:00.290
I did have a brother disown me
when he found out I was trans.

365
00:25:00.373 --> 00:25:03.043
but it's fine.
I try to take the high road. you know?

366
00:25:03.126 --> 00:25:06.755
When I heard he and his wife had a child.
I sent the nicest greeting card.

367
00:25:06.838 --> 00:25:09.966
It said. "Congratulations. it's a boy...

368
00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:11.968
for now!"

369
00:25:12.886 --> 00:25:14.262
Thank you guys so much.

370
00:25:14.846 --> 00:25:16.765
[cheers. applause]

371
00:25:21.353 --> 00:25:23.605
Jaye McBride. let her hear it!

372
00:25:26.608 --> 00:25:28.068
Alright!

373
00:25:29.027 --> 00:25:32.530
I don't know if you guys are
familiar with the Oscars.

374
00:25:32.614 --> 00:25:35.825
but I just... Yeah. I got to co-host
the Oscars this year.

375
00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:40.038
Yes. And...

376
00:25:40.121 --> 00:25:43.333
You know. we all saw
that sad thing that happened.

377
00:25:43.416 --> 00:25:45.669
Jessica Chastain won.

378
00:25:47.921 --> 00:25:52.926
No. it was really sad. the Will Smith
thing where he hit Chris Rock.

379
00:25:53.009 --> 00:25:55.345
It was a total bummer. shocking.

380
00:25:55.428 --> 00:25:57.514
but you know. I guess it's like.

381
00:25:58.473 --> 00:26:01.059
he got in one little fight
and his mom got scared.

382
00:26:01.142 --> 00:26:02.769
I don't know. I don't know!

383
00:26:04.479 --> 00:26:05.772
I got censored that night.

384
00:26:05.855 --> 00:26:08.066
There were a couple things
that I wasn't allowed to say.

385
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:10.527
So I think I'll tell you guys right now.

386
00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:11.611
[audience cheers]

387
00:26:11.695 --> 00:26:13.989
Yeah. you guys seem like bad people.
Okay.

388
00:26:14.072 --> 00:26:15.365
I don't know why they said no.

389
00:26:15.448 --> 00:26:17.909
So my husband
was going down on me.

390
00:26:19.953 --> 00:26:22.914
or as he calls it. "Squid Game."

391
00:26:25.875 --> 00:26:26.960
So...

392
00:26:28.169 --> 00:26:30.046
he's in my <i>Nightmare Alley...</i>

393
00:26:31.673 --> 00:26:33.258
my <i>House of Gucci.</i>

394
00:26:34.217 --> 00:26:37.220
And I say. <i>"C'mon. C'mon."</i>
you know?

395
00:26:37.304 --> 00:26:39.389
He goes <i>"tick. tick... BOOM!"</i>
He <i>"Bells fast."</i>

396
00:26:39.472 --> 00:26:42.017
I say. "Get off my <i>Dune."</i>
and that's how our son was born.

397
00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:43.268
What do you think?

398
00:26:43.351 --> 00:26:45.437
[cheers. applause]

399
00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:48.898
Alright. let's keep it moving right along.
Ladies and gentlemen.

400
00:26:48.982 --> 00:26:51.609
please welcome Christina P!

401
00:26:51.693 --> 00:26:54.946
[cheers. applause]

402
00:27:01.202 --> 00:27:02.871
Oh!

403
00:27:02.954 --> 00:27:07.000
Hello. Los Angeles.
Woohoo!

404
00:27:07.876 --> 00:27:12.422
Oh. man. I moved to Texas.
I was in Angelino for 44 years.

405
00:27:12.505 --> 00:27:14.799
I'm sorry. I know.
I feel guilty being here.

406
00:27:14.883 --> 00:27:17.594
I feel like a divorced dad...

407
00:27:18.803 --> 00:27:20.889
that's come back to visit their kid.

408
00:27:20.972 --> 00:27:24.351
I'm like. "Listen. I love your mom.
but I had to go. okay?"

409
00:27:26.227 --> 00:27:27.562
You don't understand. man.

410
00:27:27.645 --> 00:27:30.690
they were wearing N-95s
in their cars alone and shit.

411
00:27:30.774 --> 00:27:32.275
It was really fucking...

412
00:27:34.944 --> 00:27:37.489
But yeah. so...

413
00:27:37.572 --> 00:27:42.118
You know. I'm a... I'm a solidly
middle-aged mom now.

414
00:27:42.702 --> 00:27:44.287
Yeah. thank you.

415
00:27:45.497 --> 00:27:49.000
And like. everything makes me fat.
Everything.

416
00:27:49.584 --> 00:27:53.088
And I live in Texas. so the only thing
I can eat with no calories

417
00:27:53.171 --> 00:27:54.464
is Klonopin.

418
00:27:56.633 --> 00:28:00.095
And I love it. I just dip it
in barbecue sauce! [smacks lips]

419
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:05.558
And I like the South.
they're very nice. they're very cool.

420
00:28:05.642 --> 00:28:09.604
but everything moves at a glacial pace.

421
00:28:10.397 --> 00:28:12.899
They have zero sense of urgency.

422
00:28:13.441 --> 00:28:16.778
And then I realized. I was like.
"Well. what am I hurrying to?

423
00:28:18.196 --> 00:28:19.697
There's nothing to do."

424
00:28:21.408 --> 00:28:25.829
What. am I hurrying to get
to Chick-fil-A before it closes on Sunday?

425
00:28:27.705 --> 00:28:30.750
You guys know why Chick-fil-A
is closed on Sunday. right?

426
00:28:31.543 --> 00:28:32.419
Because...

427
00:28:32.502 --> 00:28:35.839
Well. that's the day they grind up
all the gay people to make...

428
00:28:38.383 --> 00:28:42.095
the batter for the biscuits.
They're so good! Ha ha!

429
00:28:44.764 --> 00:28:48.685
And they take homosexual semen.
and that's what that orange sauce...

430
00:28:51.604 --> 00:28:52.897
Delicious.

431
00:28:54.274 --> 00:28:57.193
The Christians are on this side.
they're not...

432
00:28:59.487 --> 00:29:00.530
Alright.

433
00:29:02.615 --> 00:29:06.786
Okay. so. I've been married for 17 years.

434
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:08.621
and oh. thank you.

435
00:29:10.373 --> 00:29:14.711
And he still pees on me in the shower.
so that's... cool.

436
00:29:16.212 --> 00:29:20.049
And he does this super creepy thing where
he likes to make eye contact with me

437
00:29:20.133 --> 00:29:21.593
while he does it.

438
00:29:22.218 --> 00:29:25.013
And he pretends
like he doesn't know what's happening.

439
00:29:26.181 --> 00:29:30.101
He'll stare at me. and he'll be like.
"Do you smell that?

440
00:29:32.771 --> 00:29:36.483
Do you smell that?
Smells bad.

441
00:29:38.067 --> 00:29:39.152
Can you smell that?"

442
00:29:39.235 --> 00:29:41.488
I'm like "No. I just had COVID."

443
00:29:42.947 --> 00:29:44.574
COVID blessings.

444
00:29:46.326 --> 00:29:50.330
So. I have a three-year-old boy.
and a six-year-old boy.

445
00:29:50.413 --> 00:29:51.915
and a husband.

446
00:29:51.998 --> 00:29:56.044
so I see more dicks than an
episode of <i>Euphoria </i>on any given day.

447
00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:58.379
Don't you love <i>Euphoria?</i>

448
00:29:58.463 --> 00:30:01.424
That's such a middle-aged mom show.
I know.

449
00:30:01.508 --> 00:30:05.929
<i>Euphoria </i>is <i>Cobra Kai </i>with titties.
It is the best.

450
00:30:09.641 --> 00:30:12.644
So people are always telling me.
they're like. "You know. Christina.

451
00:30:12.727 --> 00:30:16.272
those kids. they grow up so fast."

452
00:30:16.356 --> 00:30:18.149
I'm like. "Do they?

453
00:30:19.317 --> 00:30:23.613
What are you feeding yours? Because
I would like to speed this shit up."

454
00:30:24.197 --> 00:30:25.406
Okay?

455
00:30:26.574 --> 00:30:28.326
And it's not the kids that bum me out.

456
00:30:28.409 --> 00:30:31.079
it's the parenting world.

457
00:30:31.162 --> 00:30:33.122
Because there's way too many demands
on parents.

458
00:30:33.206 --> 00:30:37.961
Like now. I got to dress my children in
organic cotton gender-neutral clothing.

459
00:30:39.087 --> 00:30:44.300
I have to find them inclusive.
non-ableist toys.

460
00:30:45.552 --> 00:30:48.972
And you got to breastfeed until
they're in college. did you know that?

461
00:30:49.556 --> 00:30:52.350
Oh. yeah. There was a woman
in my "Mommy and Me" class

462
00:30:52.433 --> 00:30:55.895
breastfeeding her four-year-old.

463
00:30:57.021 --> 00:31:00.525
I'm sorry. 208-week-old. yes?

464
00:31:02.819 --> 00:31:05.905
Will McKenzie be weaned
in time for prom?

465
00:31:10.869 --> 00:31:12.996
My parents didn't do shit.

466
00:31:13.621 --> 00:31:16.791
Right? Parents before
never had to do anything.

467
00:31:16.875 --> 00:31:20.587
My parents didn't even put
a seatbelt on me in the car.

468
00:31:22.005 --> 00:31:24.883
I used to ride in the back
of my dad's pick-up truck...

469
00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:27.302
in a lawn chair.

470
00:31:29.888 --> 00:31:33.641
and then I would hang out
trying to tag street signs.

471
00:31:35.894 --> 00:31:39.814
And then when the cops pulled you over.
he'd let you play with his gun.

472
00:31:43.276 --> 00:31:46.738
But today. oh. my God. the parents.
they're all freaked out.

473
00:31:46.821 --> 00:31:50.992
You ever see these helicopter moms?
These helicopter moms? Yeah.

474
00:31:51.075 --> 00:31:53.703
So. I go to the park.

475
00:31:54.287 --> 00:31:56.080
and that's "me time." you know?

476
00:31:56.164 --> 00:31:58.583
I have a beer. I chill out.

477
00:32:01.002 --> 00:32:04.172
You just let them run.
that's what the park is for!

478
00:32:05.632 --> 00:32:07.759
-[man] Yeah!
-Right.

479
00:32:07.842 --> 00:32:10.637
Then I see these poor
helicopter moms. and look. I get it.

480
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.305
I was like that after my first kid.

481
00:32:12.388 --> 00:32:14.349
You ever see that mom
that's trying to do it right?

482
00:32:14.432 --> 00:32:15.892
You're just trying to do it right.

483
00:32:15.975 --> 00:32:19.896
and she's narrating everything
the kid is doing. as they're doing it.

484
00:32:20.438 --> 00:32:24.192
"Okay. Good job. Cooper!
Good job. Cooper!

485
00:32:24.734 --> 00:32:25.652
Yeah. Cooper.

486
00:32:25.735 --> 00:32:27.904
now put your foot on the ladder. Cooper.
Good job!

487
00:32:27.987 --> 00:32:30.365
Put your foot on the ladder. Cooper.
now run across. Cooper.

488
00:32:30.448 --> 00:32:34.619
run across. Cooper. run across. Cooper.
good job. Cooper. good job. Cooper!

489
00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:40.166
Would you like a snack. Cooper?
Cooper. snack? Snack? Cooper. Cooper?

490
00:32:40.249 --> 00:32:42.502
How about a cheese stick?
How about a cheese stick?

491
00:32:42.585 --> 00:32:44.003
Water? Water? Water?

492
00:32:44.087 --> 00:32:46.923
Cooper? Cooper?
Snack? Snack? Snack? Snack?"

493
00:32:52.845 --> 00:32:55.223
Oh! Oh!

494
00:32:55.723 --> 00:33:01.813
Oh. until finally. little Cooper couldn't
take it anymore. and he goes.

495
00:33:01.896 --> 00:33:03.022
"I need space!"

496
00:33:05.274 --> 00:33:09.195
I almost high-fived that kid. I was like.
"Look at you. asserting boundaries

497
00:33:09.278 --> 00:33:10.488
with your mother!

498
00:33:11.906 --> 00:33:15.994
That took me ten years in psychotherapy!
You just figured that out?"

499
00:33:18.329 --> 00:33:22.291
And stop telling kids to be themselves.
Jesus Christ.

500
00:33:22.375 --> 00:33:25.336
Stop telling kids to be themselves.

501
00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:27.880
They already know how.
They know how.

502
00:33:27.964 --> 00:33:29.215
Just ask my sons.

503
00:33:29.298 --> 00:33:31.926
They're probably naked right now
on the driveway.

504
00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:33.678
wearing nothing but cowboy boots.

505
00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:39.767
And the other day. my son runs up to me.
the older one. the six-year-old.

506
00:33:39.851 --> 00:33:42.770
he runs up to me naked. and he goes.
"Hey. Mom. hey. Mom!

507
00:33:42.854 --> 00:33:44.188
You want a surprise?"

508
00:33:44.689 --> 00:33:47.608
And then he turned
around and he farted right at me.

509
00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:51.821
Timing was impeccable.

510
00:33:54.991 --> 00:33:57.118
The three-year-old sees that.

511
00:33:58.411 --> 00:33:59.871
and does the exact same thing:

512
00:33:59.954 --> 00:34:03.458
"Hey. Mom! Mom! Mom! You want to see a...
Do you want to see a surprise?"

513
00:34:04.667 --> 00:34:08.838
Turns around. spreads his cheeks apart.

514
00:34:10.131 --> 00:34:12.592
and goes. "Smell my ass!

515
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:15.803
Smell it!"

516
00:34:21.184 --> 00:34:26.355
Yeah. I'd say you have a pretty good idea
of who you are

517
00:34:26.439 --> 00:34:28.733
when you aim
your asshole at somebody. right?

518
00:34:33.154 --> 00:34:37.450
And stop telling me that gender
isn't real. Stop it. stop it.

519
00:34:37.533 --> 00:34:40.119
Stop telling me that
"gender is a social construct."

520
00:34:40.203 --> 00:34:42.830
People who say that
have not raised boys.

521
00:34:44.082 --> 00:34:47.794
Oh. girls and boys are the same?
Oh. really? Really!

522
00:34:48.961 --> 00:34:53.424
You've seen a six-year-old girl
piss out a campfire?

523
00:34:59.889 --> 00:35:02.016
And then be super pumped about it?

524
00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:04.477
Like. "Oh my God. do you smell that?

525
00:35:06.354 --> 00:35:09.899
Can you smell that? Smells bad."

526
00:35:11.192 --> 00:35:13.486
Good to see that disgusting is genetic.

527
00:35:13.569 --> 00:35:16.739
Alright. thank you guys so much.
Thank you so much.

528
00:35:16.823 --> 00:35:19.784
[cheers. applause]

529
00:35:25.289 --> 00:35:29.210
This is a real treat. I get to bring out
my very best friend in the whole world.

530
00:35:29.293 --> 00:35:33.464
Ladies and gentlemen. please welcome
Ms. Rachel Feinstein!

531
00:35:33.548 --> 00:35:36.300
[cheers. applause]

532
00:35:40.096 --> 00:35:41.097
Thank you!

533
00:35:43.141 --> 00:35:45.434
Thank you. guys.
you're nice to me here.

534
00:35:45.935 --> 00:35:47.979
It's been a weird week.
My family was visiting.

535
00:35:48.062 --> 00:35:50.982
it's a lot with my mom. I don't know
if anybody has a parent like this.

536
00:35:51.065 --> 00:35:52.817
My mother has no boundaries.

537
00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:54.402
Every time I'm alone with her.

538
00:35:54.485 --> 00:35:57.280
she tells me something
I truly never wanted to know.

539
00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:02.743
She'll be like. "Fine. there was a year
when I considered leaving your father."

540
00:36:02.827 --> 00:36:04.537
I'm like. "I don't want to know that."

541
00:36:05.371 --> 00:36:07.540
She's like. "I called it my dark year."

542
00:36:07.623 --> 00:36:09.625
I'm like. "You title years of your life?

543
00:36:10.418 --> 00:36:13.963
You teach low-impact aerobics.
You don't know darkness."

544
00:36:15.756 --> 00:36:19.218
I'm the same way. but with strangers.
Like. I'll overshare with any stranger.

545
00:36:19.302 --> 00:36:21.971
I'll be in line at a CVS.
somebody smiles at me. and I'll be like.

546
00:36:22.054 --> 00:36:26.100
"I guess I never felt seen by my father?
I mean. I knew he loved me. but..."

547
00:36:27.768 --> 00:36:29.604
That was
my worst fear when I had a kid.

548
00:36:29.687 --> 00:36:32.481
like. "What if I don't connect to her?"
Because you hear that happens.

549
00:36:32.565 --> 00:36:33.691
I'm like. "I'll tell everyone!"

550
00:36:33.774 --> 00:36:36.194
I'll be at a barbecue. and somebody
will be like. "She's so cute."

551
00:36:36.277 --> 00:36:39.655
and I'll be like. "Isn't it crazy. but
I don't love her. Like. I feel nothing...

552
00:36:40.615 --> 00:36:43.034
but a vague sense of resentment!"

553
00:36:44.744 --> 00:36:47.330
Then. when I did love her.
I started announcing it to everyone.

554
00:36:47.413 --> 00:36:49.665
I was like. "We love her!" My
brother's like. "You shouldn't say that.

555
00:36:49.749 --> 00:36:52.418
Most people assume
you love your own kids.

556
00:36:52.501 --> 00:36:55.421
It's kind of alarming. actually."
I'm like. "That's fair feedback."

557
00:36:56.923 --> 00:36:59.550
She's a toddler. She's at that age.
She's two years old.

558
00:36:59.634 --> 00:37:01.344
She just empties every room.

559
00:37:01.427 --> 00:37:03.971
She just turns it out
like she's looking for coke. just...

560
00:37:05.014 --> 00:37:06.849
like she has 24 hours
to leave the country

561
00:37:06.933 --> 00:37:09.143
before a drug dealer shoots her
in the face.

562
00:37:11.729 --> 00:37:15.358
My husband's a fireman.
I mean. I think he's a fireman.

563
00:37:15.441 --> 00:37:18.319
Thank you. He could just be a stripper
with a fireman costume.

564
00:37:21.989 --> 00:37:23.115
But this is my life now.

565
00:37:23.199 --> 00:37:26.869
I just have to go to these Staten Island
FDNY dinner dances

566
00:37:26.953 --> 00:37:29.872
and he'll just deposit me
at a shrimp station somewhere.

567
00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.709
I'm always the only Jew.
All the women are named Gina.

568
00:37:33.793 --> 00:37:35.670
There's just like a sea of Ginas.

569
00:37:36.212 --> 00:37:40.174
Just rows of hoisted tan racks
and shimmering crucifixes.

570
00:37:43.219 --> 00:37:45.888
The men... the way they
congratulated us. the other firemen.

571
00:37:45.972 --> 00:37:47.348
when we had a baby was terrifying.

572
00:37:47.431 --> 00:37:48.933
They'd be like.
"Beautiful thing right there. huh?

573
00:37:49.016 --> 00:37:52.436
Tiny baby girl. You got to cherish
her now. alright? While she's young."

574
00:37:53.938 --> 00:37:56.482
Why does this feel like
an active threat. somehow?

575
00:37:57.775 --> 00:38:00.069
"You know what? At the end
of the day it's about family.

576
00:38:00.152 --> 00:38:01.946
Alright? Remember that.
It's about family." I'm like.

577
00:38:02.029 --> 00:38:04.490
"Why do I feel like I'm about
to get offed on <i>The Sopranos</i>

578
00:38:04.573 --> 00:38:05.992
whenever you guys greet us?"

579
00:38:06.617 --> 00:38:08.786
They always sound
like they're about to admit something

580
00:38:08.869 --> 00:38:10.788
they can't hold in any longer.

581
00:38:10.871 --> 00:38:12.915
They'll be like. "You know what?
The days are long.

582
00:38:12.999 --> 00:38:15.710
the years are short. alright?
You got to cherish her right now.

583
00:38:15.793 --> 00:38:17.295
Killed my first wife Diane."

584
00:38:17.378 --> 00:38:19.422
I'm like. "I don't think you meant
to say that out loud. Dino."

585
00:38:21.465 --> 00:38:25.011
"Diane went fast. too. You know? I watched
the light go out in her eyes. alright?

586
00:38:25.094 --> 00:38:27.346
Everybody's good! Everybody's safe.
Things are good!"

587
00:38:28.806 --> 00:38:30.599
But that's my type.
Your type is your type.

588
00:38:30.683 --> 00:38:34.312
You can't change your type. I just like
a thick-necked. ignorant-looking man.

589
00:38:34.395 --> 00:38:35.563
That's what I like!

590
00:38:36.605 --> 00:38:39.066
I like a guy that looks like he'd say.
"Follow the money"

591
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:40.901
when he's talking about the vaccine.

592
00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:45.406
The guys are generally named Vinny.
there's an occasional Dino.

593
00:38:45.489 --> 00:38:46.907
But one of the Vinnies came up to...

594
00:38:46.991 --> 00:38:50.411
One of the Vinnies came up to us. he goes.
"You got to take her to Disney. though.

595
00:38:50.494 --> 00:38:53.414
That's the real family experience.
You got to take her to EPCOT."

596
00:38:53.497 --> 00:38:56.709
Then he goes. "That's the real Japan.
at EPCOT. you know?"

597
00:38:58.169 --> 00:39:01.756
"That's like. legit Japan."
With no irony whatsoever.

598
00:39:02.548 --> 00:39:05.217
He's like. "People think
you got to spend all this cash.

599
00:39:05.301 --> 00:39:08.304
and fly all the way to Japan.
but it's a fucking scam."

600
00:39:08.888 --> 00:39:12.266
He referred to traveling the world
as a scam somehow.

601
00:39:13.267 --> 00:39:17.355
and EPCOT as reality.
That was real life in Vinny's mind.

602
00:39:19.815 --> 00:39:23.569
But yeah. I asked my mom. "What was I like
when I was my daughter's age?"

603
00:39:23.652 --> 00:39:25.863
She can never think of anything good
to say about me.

604
00:39:25.946 --> 00:39:28.532
She'll always be like.
"You know. you ate very fast."

605
00:39:28.616 --> 00:39:30.534
I'm like.
"That's the detail you pull out?"

606
00:39:31.452 --> 00:39:34.747
She's like. "Well. you ate at a rapid
pace. You choked on a chicken bone once.

607
00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:36.874
I do remember that.
You were a greedy eater.

608
00:39:37.917 --> 00:39:41.545
There was a certain rampant quality
to your eating and we didn't feel safe."

609
00:39:41.629 --> 00:39:44.965
I'm like. "Thank you. this was real
helpful. I'll circle back with you."

610
00:39:45.383 --> 00:39:48.511
And a lot of the other "firewives"--
That's not a term.

611
00:39:48.594 --> 00:39:50.971
they've actually asked me to stop
saying that...

612
00:39:53.057 --> 00:39:56.102
"Badge banger." I prefer that.
I identify as a badge banger.

613
00:39:57.978 --> 00:39:59.563
Though. a lot of the other women--

614
00:39:59.647 --> 00:40:00.940
a lot of the people I know do this.

615
00:40:01.023 --> 00:40:04.693
They'll post these long monologues
about how fantastic their marriages are

616
00:40:04.777 --> 00:40:06.862
on Instagram.
Do you know people that do this?

617
00:40:06.946 --> 00:40:09.698
I don't understand the instinct
to drag your husband out

618
00:40:09.782 --> 00:40:13.411
to a pumpkin patch somewhere.
The guy's bloated and hung over.

619
00:40:14.829 --> 00:40:16.205
He's completely confused.

620
00:40:16.288 --> 00:40:18.833
He has no idea
why he's in matching flannels

621
00:40:18.916 --> 00:40:21.293
with his entire extended family.

622
00:40:23.546 --> 00:40:27.842
And they'll be like. "Vinny.
you challenge me every single day.

623
00:40:29.802 --> 00:40:33.597
Every day with you is like a beautiful.
challenging journey.

624
00:40:35.099 --> 00:40:39.270
You have truly made me question everything
I ever thought was possible

625
00:40:39.937 --> 00:40:43.023
in this non-stop learning voyage
we're all on together."

626
00:40:43.107 --> 00:40:44.942
I'm like. "Vinny is on PornHub <i>right now</i>.

627
00:40:46.068 --> 00:40:48.446
What the fuck
has he made you question?"

628
00:40:48.529 --> 00:40:52.158
The last time I saw him. he was so drunk.
he was wet. Just dripping.

629
00:40:53.367 --> 00:40:55.453
Also. my husband never takes pictures
of me.

630
00:40:55.536 --> 00:40:57.746
he always claims
there's not enough room on his phone.

631
00:40:57.830 --> 00:41:00.458
I'm like.
"It's not a storage issue."

632
00:41:00.541 --> 00:41:02.585
He's like. "There's not enough
room on my phone!"

633
00:41:02.668 --> 00:41:05.212
The one picture he took of me
at our wedding. I was eating.

634
00:41:05.296 --> 00:41:07.965
I had a sandwich falling out
of the corner of my mouth.

635
00:41:08.048 --> 00:41:10.092
It was the most slovenly.
disgraceful moment.

636
00:41:10.176 --> 00:41:11.802
I'm like.
"That's the picture you take?"

637
00:41:11.886 --> 00:41:13.596
He's like.
"Well. it was like. the essence of you.

638
00:41:13.679 --> 00:41:15.639
you know?
You're a greedy eater."

639
00:41:16.182 --> 00:41:18.058
Alright. you guys.
thank you so much.

640
00:41:18.142 --> 00:41:20.769
[cheers. applause]

641
00:41:23.814 --> 00:41:26.525
Rachel Feinstein. let her hear it!

642
00:41:31.614 --> 00:41:34.909
These comedians are my best friends.
including this one.

643
00:41:34.992 --> 00:41:37.077
He's just one of my absolute
favorite comics.

644
00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:40.789
And you know him
as Mr. Chris DiStefano!

645
00:41:40.873 --> 00:41:43.959
[cheers. applause]

646
00:41:44.043 --> 00:41:45.586
Great job. Amy.

647
00:41:46.295 --> 00:41:47.755
Oh!

648
00:41:50.174 --> 00:41:51.133
Hello!

649
00:41:51.217 --> 00:41:54.553
Hello. hello. how you doing?
You feel good? You look good?

650
00:41:55.095 --> 00:41:58.265
This is what it is. dude.
It's the parenting show.

651
00:41:58.349 --> 00:42:01.560
I feel like nobody in here
even has kids. right?

652
00:42:01.644 --> 00:42:03.395
It's L.A.. who has...?
Like eight people.

653
00:42:03.479 --> 00:42:06.649
You have kids. dude? Yeah.
You look like you have long COVID.

654
00:42:06.732 --> 00:42:09.360
You're just like sitting there
breath... I could tell.

655
00:42:09.443 --> 00:42:11.070
I knew you had kids.
I saw you in the back.

656
00:42:11.153 --> 00:42:12.696
I was like.
"This guy looks like he's dying!"

657
00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:14.073
And yeah.

658
00:42:14.156 --> 00:42:18.077
I got kids. I got two little girls.
My daughters are Puerto Rican.

659
00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.621
You know what I mean?
So. diverse? I'm a great white.

660
00:42:20.704 --> 00:42:24.792
You know? So. this great white man.
I have these little Latina children

661
00:42:24.875 --> 00:42:27.670
and they don't speak English.
that's the thing.

662
00:42:27.753 --> 00:42:30.130
My kids. especially my older one.
she just doesn't...

663
00:42:30.214 --> 00:42:32.758
They just speak Spanish.
The mom is always just...

664
00:42:32.841 --> 00:42:36.220
I'm trying to watch <i>Encanto</i>
to talk to my fucking kids.

665
00:42:36.303 --> 00:42:40.474
And I can't... you know. which is great!
I want them to learn different languages.

666
00:42:40.558 --> 00:42:44.061
but Papi only speaks English. you know?

667
00:42:44.728 --> 00:42:48.399
But I think the thing is.
with having kids.

668
00:42:48.482 --> 00:42:51.485
like I don't have a lot
of time or energy to like.

669
00:42:51.569 --> 00:42:53.112
think about a lot of stuff.

670
00:42:53.195 --> 00:42:55.364
Like. I had to go to Portland.

671
00:42:55.447 --> 00:42:57.575
You know what I mean?
Whatever. that city.

672
00:42:57.658 --> 00:42:59.952
I love this country.
I bleed red. white. and blue.

673
00:43:00.035 --> 00:43:02.288
but fucking Portland?
You know? I mean...

674
00:43:02.371 --> 00:43:04.999
Those people. it's just. it's too much.

675
00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:08.460
Like they're very passive aggressive.
very woke.

676
00:43:08.544 --> 00:43:12.214
and I was just in there. and they're just
looking at you. judging you.

677
00:43:12.298 --> 00:43:14.633
And I was in there two weeks ago.
Two weeks ago!

678
00:43:14.717 --> 00:43:17.344
I had to go in there.
I went to a coffee shop.

679
00:43:17.428 --> 00:43:21.098
and I didn't know
that you still had to wear a mask

680
00:43:21.181 --> 00:43:23.934
because I was like.
it's present-day America.

681
00:43:24.018 --> 00:43:26.604
and you know.
the barista's just like this.

682
00:43:26.687 --> 00:43:28.188
she's going like this.

683
00:43:28.272 --> 00:43:31.233
She keeps doing this. I was like.
"I don't know what you're doing."

684
00:43:31.317 --> 00:43:32.693
Like. she's just going like that.

685
00:43:32.776 --> 00:43:36.071
I was like. "I don't know sign language.
I'm sorry. I should be better.

686
00:43:36.155 --> 00:43:38.490
I'm a white piece of shit.
I know. I'm sorry.

687
00:43:38.574 --> 00:43:40.784
I'm not anti-sign.
What do you want me to do?"

688
00:43:40.868 --> 00:43:44.163
And she just wasn't talking.
she just kept going like this.

689
00:43:44.246 --> 00:43:47.791
I was like. "What are you trying
to tell me. lady? Just use your words!"

690
00:43:47.875 --> 00:43:51.086
And then she was like.
"You need to put on a mask!"

691
00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:54.298
I was like. "Oh. okay.
You should have just said that!"

692
00:43:54.381 --> 00:43:58.886
So I was like. "Okay." And I'm just
politely putting on a mask.

693
00:43:58.969 --> 00:44:01.680
and I was like "I'm sorry.
I'm from New York. and...

694
00:44:01.764 --> 00:44:05.225
we don't have the masks there anymore."

695
00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:10.481
And she was like. "Well. here in Portland.
we still take COVID very seriously."

696
00:44:10.564 --> 00:44:13.150
I was like. "You seem like a fun person.
You really do.

697
00:44:13.233 --> 00:44:15.611
You just seem like a real ball of laughs."

698
00:44:15.694 --> 00:44:18.322
And so I proceed to order my drink.

699
00:44:18.405 --> 00:44:21.700
I was like. "Can I have
a small iced coffee. black?"

700
00:44:21.784 --> 00:44:23.494
She was like. "Excuse me?"

701
00:44:23.577 --> 00:44:25.829
I was like. "Can you not hear me
through the mask?"

702
00:44:25.913 --> 00:44:30.542
I was like.
"Can I have a small iced coffee. black?"

703
00:44:30.626 --> 00:44:34.880
She was like. "Do you mean
a small iced coffee with no cream?"

704
00:44:35.714 --> 00:44:40.386
I was like. "Isn't that the same
as a small iced coffee. black?"

705
00:44:40.886 --> 00:44:43.472
She was like. "After what the
African-American community's

706
00:44:43.555 --> 00:44:45.182
been through these last two years.

707
00:44:45.265 --> 00:44:48.394
I think you need to do a better job
ordering your coffees."

708
00:44:48.894 --> 00:44:51.689
I was like.
"I'd rather be beheaded by ISIS

709
00:44:51.772 --> 00:44:55.359
than have to talk to you
for one more second."

710
00:44:55.442 --> 00:44:57.361
So I ripped that mask off.

711
00:44:57.444 --> 00:45:00.406
I walked right out of that coffee shop.
I walked two blocks down

712
00:45:00.489 --> 00:45:02.574
to another coffee shop.
walked right in. and said.

713
00:45:02.658 --> 00:45:04.660
"Can I have a small iced coffee
with no cream?"

714
00:45:04.743 --> 00:45:07.371
Because I am such a little pussy.

715
00:45:09.039 --> 00:45:11.041
But you know--
I don't know. It's what it is.

716
00:45:11.125 --> 00:45:12.376
People are just...

717
00:45:13.001 --> 00:45:15.838
Everyone's going a little nuts.
Everyone's just a little off.

718
00:45:15.921 --> 00:45:19.133
You know what I'm saying?
They're just a little off lately.

719
00:45:19.216 --> 00:45:21.135
Like I had to put my dog down.

720
00:45:21.218 --> 00:45:23.387
Listen. he lived a good life.
Eighteen years.

721
00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:26.473
Eighteen years. my dog.
Little Larry. Larry was his name.

722
00:45:27.558 --> 00:45:29.810
Eighteen years old.
but he was one of those dogs.

723
00:45:29.893 --> 00:45:32.271
He was dying for like
the past 16 years.

724
00:45:32.354 --> 00:45:35.232
Every time I'd go visit my mother--

725
00:45:35.315 --> 00:45:38.694
she had the dog-- another piece
of his body was being biopsied.

726
00:45:38.777 --> 00:45:41.280
an eye didn't work.
his head was turned over.

727
00:45:41.363 --> 00:45:42.865
he was always bleeding.

728
00:45:42.948 --> 00:45:45.993
He looks like he's fighting
in the Civil War.

729
00:45:46.076 --> 00:45:48.078
Somebody needs to put this dog down.

730
00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:50.914
It was clear this dog wanted to die.

731
00:45:50.998 --> 00:45:52.708
And I would just go visit my mom.

732
00:45:52.791 --> 00:45:54.877
and try. like. "Mom.
we need to put the dog down."

733
00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:56.837
She'd be like.
"Jesus hasn't called him yet."

734
00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:00.299
I'm like. "No. he's calling me
to tell you... I'm telling you.

735
00:46:00.382 --> 00:46:02.176
the dog wants to die so bad."

736
00:46:02.259 --> 00:46:04.636
I would come over
with a fistful of baker's chocolate.

737
00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:07.723
I'd just be like. "Who wants death
by chocolate. Larry? Come on.

738
00:46:07.806 --> 00:46:09.600
Just eat it. it's a great way to go out."

739
00:46:12.227 --> 00:46:16.440
And so finally. one day I go visit my mom.
and the dog's dying.

740
00:46:16.523 --> 00:46:19.568
I mean.
Larry's pretty much dead on the floor.

741
00:46:19.651 --> 00:46:22.446
And I'm just like.
"Let's go take the dog to the vet

742
00:46:22.529 --> 00:46:25.782
and just put it out of its misery."
She's like. "You're right. let's go."

743
00:46:25.866 --> 00:46:30.204
And it was 12 o'clock. it was midnight.
and I was fucking starving.

744
00:46:30.287 --> 00:46:34.374
So we're driving to the vet. and I see
a Wendy's out of the corner of my eye.

745
00:46:34.458 --> 00:46:37.669
I was like. "Mom. real quick. let's go.
I'll go to Wendy's real quick.

746
00:46:37.753 --> 00:46:40.881
I'll get whatever you want."
and she's like. "No. let's go to the vet!"

747
00:46:40.964 --> 00:46:45.427
I was like. "Fine. I'll just starve then!"
I was like a disgruntled fucking teenager.

748
00:46:45.511 --> 00:46:46.762
I'm 37.

749
00:46:47.721 --> 00:46:51.558
So. we get to the vet.
and the vet is so nice.

750
00:46:51.642 --> 00:46:53.268
She's like the nicest lady ever.

751
00:46:53.352 --> 00:46:55.729
She's like. "We did our tests
on little Larry.

752
00:46:55.812 --> 00:46:58.357
and we do see that
he's at the end of his life.

753
00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:01.443
and we're just going to put a little prick
in his little paw.

754
00:47:01.527 --> 00:47:03.904
and the medicine's going
to go through in 30 seconds.

755
00:47:03.987 --> 00:47:06.615
It's going to be 30 seconds.
His little heart's going to stop.

756
00:47:06.698 --> 00:47:08.659
but he's going to go to Heaven
with all the other dogs.

757
00:47:08.742 --> 00:47:11.078
and Cruella. and everyone's up there.

758
00:47:11.161 --> 00:47:12.412
and he's going to be fine.

759
00:47:12.496 --> 00:47:15.040
he's going to be out of pain.
and this is the right thing."

760
00:47:15.123 --> 00:47:18.168
And I'm like. "Okay. fine." Because
in my head. I'm like. "30 seconds.

761
00:47:18.252 --> 00:47:20.671
By the time we do the paperwork.
everything will be good.

762
00:47:20.754 --> 00:47:23.257
You know. it's 12:30.
Wendy's does close at 2:00."

763
00:47:25.676 --> 00:47:28.554
And listen. it's what it is.
This is a 100% true story.

764
00:47:28.637 --> 00:47:32.057
So. the medicine's going through.
just like she said.

765
00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:34.643
Little prick in his paw.
it's going like a roller coaster.

766
00:47:34.726 --> 00:47:37.271
it's going to hit his little body.
stop his little heart.

767
00:47:37.354 --> 00:47:38.397
thirty seconds.

768
00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:41.149
And listen. we're all upset.
I'm upset. my mom's upset.

769
00:47:41.233 --> 00:47:44.069
and I'm just comforting her.
Comforting my mom. she's crying.

770
00:47:44.152 --> 00:47:46.405
I'm like. "Mom. this is fine."
We get down to 15 seconds. I'm like.

771
00:47:46.488 --> 00:47:48.949
"We are halfway there. Mom.
We are halfway there."

772
00:47:49.032 --> 00:47:53.870
We get to five. I started counting
out loud. I was like. "Five. four.

773
00:47:53.954 --> 00:47:58.375
three. two. one!
It's a celebration!"

774
00:47:59.459 --> 00:48:01.003
And Larry's still alive.

775
00:48:01.086 --> 00:48:04.840
He's just still alive. And I'm like.
"Okay. that happens."

776
00:48:04.923 --> 00:48:08.218
but as time is going on.
seconds are going by.

777
00:48:08.302 --> 00:48:11.722
Larry looks like he's getting more energy.
like he's getting color back

778
00:48:11.805 --> 00:48:13.515
that he never had.
his fur used to be gray.

779
00:48:13.599 --> 00:48:15.559
now it's getting that nice orange tint.

780
00:48:15.642 --> 00:48:18.979
he's standing up on his legs
once again.

781
00:48:19.062 --> 00:48:23.150
I was like. "Wow. Larry looks
fucking good right now. What's happening?"

782
00:48:23.692 --> 00:48:27.946
Five minutes go by. and finally I say
to the vet. "Is there a problem?"

783
00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:32.326
She goes. "Absolutely."
I was like. "Oh. okay."

784
00:48:32.409 --> 00:48:36.079
She goes outside. comes back
a minute later. She goes.

785
00:48:36.163 --> 00:48:38.290
"I am so sorry."

786
00:48:38.874 --> 00:48:41.835
She was like.
"I hired a new vet tech.

787
00:48:41.918 --> 00:48:47.341
and the vet tech accidentally
gave your dog electrolytes

788
00:48:47.424 --> 00:48:49.801
because the dog next door to you
was dehydrated

789
00:48:49.885 --> 00:48:52.554
and we mixed up the medication."

790
00:48:52.638 --> 00:48:56.141
She goes. "But don't worry.
I have the right medication right here.

791
00:48:56.224 --> 00:48:58.185
He'll be dead in a second."

792
00:48:58.268 --> 00:48:59.102
I swear to God.

793
00:48:59.186 --> 00:49:01.146
as soon as she put
the right medicine in.

794
00:49:01.229 --> 00:49:02.939
he died immediately.

795
00:49:03.023 --> 00:49:06.443
It was like somebody had a sniper rifle
at the top of the fucking room

796
00:49:06.526 --> 00:49:09.237
and just shot him in the head.
Rolled over. Xs over his eyes.

797
00:49:09.321 --> 00:49:13.116
soul gone to heaven.
I had a Baconator in my hand at 1:59.

798
00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:17.079
It was fucking fantastic.
Alright. guys. thank you.

799
00:49:17.162 --> 00:49:19.665
[cheers. applause]

800
00:49:24.878 --> 00:49:28.006
You guys are the best.
You really are such a great crowd.

801
00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:31.343
Everyone's talking about you backstage.
Everybody loves you.

802
00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:34.304
We want to make it official.
We want to commit.

803
00:49:34.846 --> 00:49:40.852
Alright. This comedian is undeniably
hilarious and I love him so much.

804
00:49:40.936 --> 00:49:43.855
Ladies and gentlemen.
please welcome Lil Rel Howery!

805
00:49:44.356 --> 00:49:47.526
[cheers. applause]

806
00:49:51.405 --> 00:49:53.824
Yeah! What up?

807
00:49:56.535 --> 00:49:58.537
Netflix is a fucking joke.

808
00:49:59.371 --> 00:50:01.707
I got a whole jean...
Look. let me tell you something.

809
00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:05.627
I'm showing my age now. I'm in my 40s.
and this is what 40-year-olds do.

810
00:50:05.711 --> 00:50:08.630
they like. match a bunch of shit
that don't make no fucking sense.

811
00:50:09.548 --> 00:50:11.550
I got a whole jean suit on
with a cowboy hat.

812
00:50:11.633 --> 00:50:13.009
This is a dad outfit for real.

813
00:50:13.885 --> 00:50:16.221
I'm the cool dad!
You know who the fuck this is.

814
00:50:19.558 --> 00:50:22.853
Man. I got a 13. 12-year-old.
and a five-year-old.

815
00:50:23.729 --> 00:50:26.273
I know. man.
Like. fuck!

816
00:50:28.024 --> 00:50:30.360
You know what's funny?
Like when I was a younger parent.

817
00:50:30.444 --> 00:50:32.446
I tried to do all the things
the right way.

818
00:50:32.529 --> 00:50:35.323
Now I don't really give a fuck no more.
You know what I'm saying?

819
00:50:35.407 --> 00:50:37.659
My five-year-old. we went
to one of those jumpy things.

820
00:50:37.743 --> 00:50:39.995
he peed in that shit.
I was like. "Oh shit. let's just go."

821
00:50:40.078 --> 00:50:41.455
You know what I mean? I ain't...

822
00:50:41.538 --> 00:50:44.207
I ain't changing. we just walking
the fuck out of here.

823
00:50:44.291 --> 00:50:46.251
He was leaking the whole time.
Nobody seen shit.

824
00:50:46.334 --> 00:50:47.711
"Come on. y'all!"

825
00:50:49.921 --> 00:50:51.339
Damn!

826
00:50:51.882 --> 00:50:54.176
Hate being a fucking new dad again.

827
00:50:55.969 --> 00:50:57.679
Carrying their fucking car seat.

828
00:50:58.597 --> 00:51:01.391
People downplay that.
Nobody realizes how heavy it is

829
00:51:01.475 --> 00:51:05.687
to carry a human being
with one fucking arm. That's stupid!

830
00:51:07.022 --> 00:51:09.483
I don't give a shit. as long as they
strapped in. I'm going to carry that shit

831
00:51:09.566 --> 00:51:13.403
the best way I can. If you upside down.
fuck it. I'm like. "Fuck it."

832
00:51:13.487 --> 00:51:15.697
No. I can't go to jail!
He good. he's strapped in!

833
00:51:16.323 --> 00:51:18.325
As long as he don't fall out. we good!

834
00:51:21.745 --> 00:51:24.581
My daughter's 13.
she's a fucking teenager now.

835
00:51:25.791 --> 00:51:27.292
She got the period.

836
00:51:28.668 --> 00:51:30.545
That's right. it happened with me.
I was hoping...

837
00:51:30.629 --> 00:51:32.672
I was like.
"Damn. you got to be with me? Shit."

838
00:51:32.756 --> 00:51:35.550
Because I'm a divorced dad. so like.
it was my time. and I'm like.

839
00:51:35.634 --> 00:51:37.344
"Wait a minute. why the fuck...?

840
00:51:37.427 --> 00:51:39.721
I ain't ready for this."
You know what I mean?

841
00:51:39.805 --> 00:51:42.599
I tried my best. but I didn't know what
to get. I ain't going to lie to you.

842
00:51:42.682 --> 00:51:43.975
I went to the store
and got everything.

843
00:51:44.059 --> 00:51:45.435
I didn't know what the fuck to get.

844
00:51:45.519 --> 00:51:47.729
That lady was ringing me up like.
"You got a shelter or something?

845
00:51:47.813 --> 00:51:49.898
What you got all these
different sizes for?

846
00:51:49.981 --> 00:51:53.193
What the fuck you got going on. sir?
What the fuck you got going on. sir?"

847
00:51:55.946 --> 00:51:57.113
I ain't fucking know.

848
00:51:58.156 --> 00:52:01.451
I'm like. "Let me get the...
the pad that absorb the most."

849
00:52:01.535 --> 00:52:03.870
Man. we stupid. that's what
we think. right?

850
00:52:03.954 --> 00:52:05.997
We think. "Get the shit that absorb
the most."

851
00:52:06.081 --> 00:52:08.917
And when I put all this shit on the table.
she like. "Uh. Dad.

852
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.127
this is for Grandma.
I don't know what the fuck...

853
00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.339
you think I've got going on.
I'm 13. sir."

854
00:52:16.174 --> 00:52:18.885
"You don't want the one
that absorb the most?"

855
00:52:18.969 --> 00:52:21.179
Like my son was there with me.
and he was confused. too.

856
00:52:21.263 --> 00:52:23.974
We was looking at this shit. and
I took everything out of the box.

857
00:52:24.057 --> 00:52:26.601
he playing with the shit...
"Put this shit down. stop playing. boy!"

858
00:52:27.269 --> 00:52:28.770
Ain't no fucking lightsaber.

859
00:52:31.731 --> 00:52:34.150
But he was like.
"Dad. you know something?

860
00:52:34.234 --> 00:52:36.361
I would want the grandma one."

861
00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:39.447
And I thought about that.

862
00:52:39.531 --> 00:52:41.324
That's how little boys
fucking think. right?

863
00:52:41.408 --> 00:52:44.202
Little girls. like. y'all don't want
nobody to know you're on your period.

864
00:52:44.286 --> 00:52:46.246
You want something to hide that shit.

865
00:52:46.329 --> 00:52:48.498
Little boys ain't shit.
If little boys had periods.

866
00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:51.585
they'd want everybody to know
they had the fattest shit here.

867
00:52:51.668 --> 00:52:53.837
"Yeah. I'm on my period.
what the fuck you talking about?

868
00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:55.964
Y'all need to take me home.
I can't go to school today.

869
00:52:56.047 --> 00:52:57.507
I'm on my period!

870
00:52:57.591 --> 00:53:01.052
I'm sleepy. I'm hungry. I'm tired.
I can't focus. I'm fucked up!"

871
00:53:08.852 --> 00:53:12.439
Learning too much about women
because I've got a fucking 13-year-old.

872
00:53:14.274 --> 00:53:16.234
We go bra shopping and shit.

873
00:53:16.318 --> 00:53:18.486
I didn't realize
it was about y'all's backs.

874
00:53:19.571 --> 00:53:25.035
Fellas. for a long time. you thought it
was about the titty meat. nope!

875
00:53:25.619 --> 00:53:28.622
That number's about how big
their fucking backs is. so...

876
00:53:28.705 --> 00:53:30.916
if you see a Double D out here.
it ain't about the titties.

877
00:53:30.999 --> 00:53:33.043
she got a big-ass back.
I'm just being honest.

878
00:53:34.044 --> 00:53:35.420
If you ain't know.

879
00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:39.758
It was weird. too.
I forget I was doing a stand-up show.

880
00:53:39.841 --> 00:53:41.217
You start thinking about real shit.

881
00:53:41.301 --> 00:53:44.179
like "Goddamn. I got to figure
this Legoland situation out."

882
00:53:47.432 --> 00:53:50.936
Fuck. you got a 13. 12. and 5-year-old.
the 5-year-old can't get on shit.

883
00:53:51.019 --> 00:53:53.146
And that means I can't get on shit.

884
00:53:53.688 --> 00:53:55.732
They get to have fun.
like the 13 and 12-year-old.

885
00:53:55.815 --> 00:53:58.360
they get to have a good-ass time.
I'm watching this motherfucker.

886
00:53:58.443 --> 00:53:59.986
I'm sorry. that's my kid. but...

887
00:54:02.989 --> 00:54:05.116
Doing some regular shit.
some little bridge.

888
00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:07.160
some dumb car that's slow as fuck.

889
00:54:08.411 --> 00:54:10.997
They do all the. "Dad. we got
on the roller coaster!"

890
00:54:11.081 --> 00:54:13.541
"Shut the fuck up!
Fuck y'all."

891
00:54:17.462 --> 00:54:18.546
Yeah. that's real.

892
00:54:19.756 --> 00:54:22.175
But my son. my 12-year-old.
he's like my best friend.

893
00:54:22.258 --> 00:54:24.427
the oldest. he's...
he's a lot like me.

894
00:54:24.511 --> 00:54:27.889
and I love that shit. I love the fact
that this brother is like me.

895
00:54:27.973 --> 00:54:30.809
Like. if he wasn't my kid.
we would be best fucking friends.

896
00:54:30.892 --> 00:54:32.936
If we was the same age.
I fucks with him.

897
00:54:33.728 --> 00:54:36.022
That's why I don't even know
how to help him sometimes.

898
00:54:36.106 --> 00:54:37.941
You know what I mean?
He going through. like--

899
00:54:38.024 --> 00:54:39.776
12-year-old boys. look. it depends.

900
00:54:39.859 --> 00:54:42.570
but boys do go through a
little weird stinking period. right?

901
00:54:42.654 --> 00:54:45.323
Where they just don't wash their ass
well enough.

902
00:54:45.865 --> 00:54:48.910
And his mama called me like.
"Yo. you got to talk to him.

903
00:54:48.994 --> 00:54:52.038
He doesn't care.
He's putting on the same clothes."

904
00:54:53.248 --> 00:54:56.376
And it's hard to talk to your best friend
about him stinking.

905
00:54:59.129 --> 00:55:00.922
Like. "Damn. brother. we got to talk."

906
00:55:01.006 --> 00:55:03.383
You try to play the game
with them a little bit and shit?

907
00:55:03.466 --> 00:55:05.885
Making little jokes.
"This is fun. right?"

908
00:55:06.886 --> 00:55:08.847
[deep sigh]

909
00:55:09.681 --> 00:55:11.766
Look. your mama say
you have musty balls.

910
00:55:13.018 --> 00:55:16.771
Would you just wash that shit so we ain't
got to talk about this shit again. please?

911
00:55:16.855 --> 00:55:19.691
I bought you some new socks.
Stop wearing the same stinking-ass socks.

912
00:55:22.610 --> 00:55:24.487
Alright. well. that's it. I'm done!

913
00:55:25.488 --> 00:55:27.907
Thank y'all so much.
I'm Lil Rel. that's my time.

914
00:55:27.991 --> 00:55:30.994
[cheers. applause]

915
00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:35.540
Lil Rel. let him hear it!

916
00:55:38.877 --> 00:55:40.295
You're such a great crowd.

917
00:55:40.378 --> 00:55:43.006
I want to say
goodnight by thanking our families

918
00:55:43.089 --> 00:55:47.761
who made us who we are. and provided us
with all of this material.

919
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:52.265
Please give it up one more time
for Chris DiStefano.

920
00:55:53.141 --> 00:55:55.685
[cheers. applause]

921
00:55:57.395 --> 00:55:58.438
That's you.

922
00:55:58.521 --> 00:56:01.107
-Oh. look at what a nice guy you were.
-[Chris] Yeah.

923
00:56:01.191 --> 00:56:05.195
What happened?
Oh. okay. Well anyway. Ron Funches!

924
00:56:05.278 --> 00:56:07.572
[cheers. applause]

925
00:56:09.532 --> 00:56:12.869
Christina P!
Give it up!

926
00:56:14.287 --> 00:56:15.830
Jaye McBride!

927
00:56:17.665 --> 00:56:20.627
Oh. Jaye. you're cute!

928
00:56:21.044 --> 00:56:22.879
Rachel Feinstein!

929
00:56:22.962 --> 00:56:24.631
[cheers. applause]

930
00:56:24.714 --> 00:56:27.258
And one more time for Lil Rel Howery.

931
00:56:27.801 --> 00:56:30.887
-[cheers. applause]
-[Amy] Aw!

932
00:56:32.013 --> 00:56:33.389
We're cute!

933
00:56:33.473 --> 00:56:36.226
One more time for everybody.
Thank you. goodnight!

934
00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:46.402
Isn't it funny that we all have known each
other for like years and years?

935
00:56:46.486 --> 00:56:48.154
We really don't know anything.

936
00:56:48.238 --> 00:56:50.240
We don't know anything
about each other.

937
00:56:50.323 --> 00:56:53.243
We talk about where we grew up on stage.
we just don't pay attention.

938
00:56:53.326 --> 00:56:56.454
Right. like I learned so much like.
talking to other comics about.

939
00:56:56.538 --> 00:57:00.542
"You went to film school?"
Like. I know nothing.

940
00:57:11.094 --> 00:57:14.180
My son wrote a sketch.
And it was really funny.

941
00:57:14.264 --> 00:57:16.808
and he like kind of
dissed me at the same time.

942
00:57:16.891 --> 00:57:18.935
Like. "Dad. I want you to be
in the sketch.

943
00:57:19.018 --> 00:57:21.938
I want you to do the voice you do
in movies when you get really high-pitched

944
00:57:22.021 --> 00:57:24.607
and don't sound how you sound in
real life." Like. "Damn. what that mean?"

945
00:57:24.691 --> 00:57:25.775
Wow. Yeah.

946
00:57:32.907 --> 00:57:34.784
It's so easy!
