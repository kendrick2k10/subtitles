3
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.200
Oh. uh. I'd like to ask you.

4
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.880
how do you go about writing a life story?

5
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.400
Because…

6
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.280
…the true things
rarely get into circulation.

7
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.600
It's usually the false things.

8
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.000
If you ever get any of those things
you want to ask. I'll tell you.

9
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.200
All of those things come from the truth.
you know?

10
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.000
Because otherwise.
it's hard to know where to start

11
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.600
if you don't start with the truth.

12
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.160
After 20 years.
it's time to clear up this case.

13
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.720
Monroe died
from an overdose of sleeping pills.

14
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.520
Speculation surrounding Monroe's death
continues to this day.

15
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.760
The charge is
Marilyn Monroe was murdered.

16
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.560
Someone in the CIA killed Monroe.

17
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.880
She was very frightened.

18
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.440
There's a great myth around her.

19
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.360
I hope your phone is clean.

20
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.240
Nobody ever knew everything.

21
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.680
Marilyn Monroe.
the Golden Girl of Hollywood.

22
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.120
The dazzling fame of Marilyn Monroe

23
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.800
delights the critics
and attracts the public in swarms.

24
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.400
Marilyn Monroe was this era's sex symbol.

25
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.920
Marilyn Monroe trod
the summit of her profession.

26
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.680
Something remarkable happened

27
00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.640
when she stepped before a camera.

28
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.000
A queen in her own realm of entertainment.

29
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.000
She was adored by millions.

30
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.240
A self-illuminating body. a star.

31
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.080
Tony. I have often said
that I could put together

32
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.000
a scenario that would absolutely
blow the minds of anybody who read it.

33
00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.280
but it would be terribly costly
to government agencies.

34
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.600
friends of mine. to people I know.

35
00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.680
- Yeah.
-I don't think I want to do that.

36
00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.360
But I never talk
to the press ever. ever. ever.

37
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.880
But I can't say anything.
and I knew it all.

38
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.840
- Except it's a waste of your time.
- Why?

39
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.400
I don't want to be the one
who sets the record straight.

40
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.360
-But. I mean. I don't know you.
- Fine.

41
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.600
Let it be.

42
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.320
Hollywood.

43
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.960
brilliant tinsel city
of lights and fantasy.

44
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.040
Hollywood.

45
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.560
glorified. glittering. fascinating.
fabulous mythical kingdom.

46
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.120
Hollywood.
the glamour capital of the world.

47
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.960
When I was a kid. and I remember
at the movies on Saturday afternoon…

48
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.760
Let's take a spin down
the Boulevard and see what we can find!

49
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.720
…I'd never come out
of the movie. They'd have to come get me.

50
00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.520
Ah. Garbo!

51
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.160
Bad. good. didn't matter.

52
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.560
Hollywood's playground!

53
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.800
Anything that would move
on the screen.

54
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.880
And here inside the gates.

55
00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.960
there's more stars than the Milky Way!

56
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.840
If you don't believe it. just follow us!

57
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.400
My favorite was Jean Harlow.

58
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.000
-She had white hair.
-

59
00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.960
The one and only Marlene Dietrich!

60
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.760
Cary Grant arrives with his best grin.

61
00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.520
As usual. Cary has
a genial greeting for everybody!

62
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.600
And Clark Gable.

63
00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.240
Clark walked
into the forecourt…

64
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.680
The crowd is still shouting
for their favorite!

65
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.840
Although I was a kid
and I didn't know anything about acting.

66
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.120
I…

67
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.440
I wanted to know.

68
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.080
Talking.

69
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:41.680
Yup.

70
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.560
-Marilyn Monroe. I knew her very well.
- You did?

71
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.920
- I'm talking about in the beginning.
- Yes.

72
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.960
- When she was a kid.
- At that time--

73
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:58.480
Well. I was… Al Rosen Agency was
one of the top agencies in the business.

74
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.320
- Right.
- I handled Cary Grant. Fredric March.

75
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.760
-Jack Oakie. Judy Garland. you know.
- Right.

76
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.480
But. you see.
the history of this business is

77
00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.440
you got one thing. I'll guarantee it.
which you didn't know about.

78
00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.360
-In this business. in the golden years…
- Yeah.

79
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.760
…every casting director.
every studio used to have a black book.

80
00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.120
you know what I mean?

81
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.520
So. every girl. you know. I'm talking
about kids that were breaking in.

82
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.680
like Marilyn Monroe.
you know. when they get started.

83
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.720
all the casting directors.

84
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.720
they would write in their black book
who could be laid.

85
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.320
You see. the business
has changed since then.

86
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.800
Today. it's the buck.

87
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.440
It used to be sex. Remember that.

88
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:45.120
Calling all girls!
Calling all girls!

89
00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.160
And now. all those lovely hopefuls
have their chance.

90
00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.200
The process of selecting
just the right girls is a careful one.

91
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.800
My. my.
what a smart looking crowd.

92
00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.280
Isn't she a honey?

93
00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.440
Isn't she sweet?

94
00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.040
Neck. 12 and a half.

95
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.760
Bust. 34 and a half.

96
00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:05.160
Pride. Adventure. Ambition.

97
00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.920
From the ends of the Earth they come.
waiting for the magic call.

98
00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.000
Hello?

99
00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.800
How can I help you?

100
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.960
Well. my husband knew her first.
early '40s.

101
00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.280
Oh. yes.

102
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:40.640
You know. a generous girl.
warm girl. really rather lovable.

103
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.480
She was very much on the restaurant scene
and the club scene.

104
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.080
- But at Romanoff's.
- Yeah. Enormous fun.

105
00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.920
And it was quite exotic.

106
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.040
It had a real mélange of people.

107
00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.800
and it was sort of the mecca for agents.

108
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.840
It had all of the film VIPs.

109
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.720
-All the pretty girls hung out there.
- Right.

110
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.440
And Marilyn was among them.
of course.

111
00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.400
So young is Hollywood

112
00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:15.040
that many of its earliest pioneers
are still active in the industry.

113
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.680
Men like Joseph Schenck.
chairman of the board of 20th Century Fox.

114
00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:22.320
Mr. Schenck brought about an era
of epic. dramatic screen stories.

115
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.800
Oh. sure. Schenck was a human being.

116
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.520
-You know what I mean.
- Yeah.

117
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.880
She had a bunch of 'em.
He wasn't the only one.

118
00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.920
There were a group
who gathered at Schenck's.

119
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.320
-She was always very much at his house.
- Yeah.

120
00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.360
And she was beginning
to make a few strides.

121
00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:56.760
In 1948.

122
00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.680
Johnny Hyde.

123
00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.720
who was a dear little man.
wonderful little man…

124
00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.240
-You know about him?
- Yes.

125
00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.040
- Johnny was in love with her.
- Yeah.

126
00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.600
Johnny Hyde spoke to me
about her first

127
00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.880
and then brought her over to Metro.

128
00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.160
Just. uh. very fresh.

129
00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.920
Very attractive.

130
00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.160
Rather timid.

131
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.200
Shy.

132
00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:22.080
And. um we talked to her
and gave her a script.

133
00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:27.000
She went away
and came back a day or two later.

134
00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.720
and. well. Marilyn read her lines.

135
00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:33.600
and she read them very beautifully.
very well.

136
00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.040
And there was no question.

137
00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.480
She was ideal for the part.

138
00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.000
- In The Asphalt Jungle?
-Yes. indeed.

139
00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.080
That was that.

140
00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.680
Only once in a decade
does the screen come up with

141
00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.400
such absorbing characters.

142
00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:49.680
Marilyn Monroe as Angela.
the easy-living. green-eyed blonde.

143
00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:57.720
Marilyn went right down
into her own personal experience

144
00:14:58.760 --> 00:14:59.960
for everything.

145
00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.880
She would reach down
and pull something out of herself

146
00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.160
that was unique and extraordinary.

147
00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:12.600
She found things
about womankind in herself.

148
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.040
She had no technique.

149
00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.520
It was all the truth.

150
00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:24.280
It was only Marilyn.
but she was Marilyn plus.

151
00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.520
An award to the popular new star.

152
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.560
And as best young box office personality.
Miss Marilyn Monroe.

153
00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:34.760
Thank you. Mr. Nichols.

154
00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:40.240
It's Marilyn Monroe.
skyrocketing to new dramatic heights.

155
00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.960
Marilyn Monroe.
all the moviegoers of America voted you

156
00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:51.480
the most popular actress of the year.
My congratulations.

157
00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.520
Thank you. Mr. Sammis.

158
00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.320
-Congratulations!
-Thank you. Lauren.

159
00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.280
And my thanks to Look magazine.

160
00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.480
A Hollywood incident
that marks another salute

161
00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:04.560
to Marilyn Monroe.

162
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.560
Thank you. I thank you very much.

163
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.560
And now here comes
a young lady who has

164
00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.800
created a real sensation
in the picture business.

165
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:17.720
having won all kinds of awards
as the number one newcomer of the year.

166
00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.760
And believe me. a swell gal with a…

167
00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.880
Take it from me. I've known her
a long time. Miss Marilyn Monroe!

168
00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.200
Let's hear it! Come on out here. Marilyn!

169
00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.200
With Marilyn Monroe
and Jane Russell.

170
00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:42.880
Yes.

171
00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.200
She was very bright.
and she wanted to learn

172
00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:55.200
and was interested in everything to.

173
00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:59.320
-you know. help her control her career.
- Right.

174
00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.680
And every night after work.
she would go to the coach.

175
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.200
- Yes.
- We were going home exhausted.

176
00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.760
She'd go to the coach.

177
00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.680
But she wanted to be good.

178
00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.520
Then when…

179
00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:18.080
…the camera went on. it was like a whole
electric light went on in the. you know…

180
00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.800
They just came to life.

181
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.480
I just felt like I was
on the outside of the world.

182
00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.760
and suddenly everything opened up.

183
00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.680
The world became friendly.
It opened up to me.

184
00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.440
I said. "Gee. what happened?"

185
00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:05.000
If I am a star.
the people made me a star.

186
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.320
But I do want to be wonderful. you know.

187
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.760
I want to do the best
that I can do in that moment.

188
00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.200
When the camera starts until it stops.

189
00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:45.120
That moment
I want to be… perfect.

190
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.480
I'll tell you.

191
00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.680
I'm terribly grateful

192
00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.280
because I remember when…

193
00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.920
things weren't like this at all.

194
00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.080
I saw her a time or two.

195
00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.400
-Years had gone by.
- Yeah.

196
00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:22.880
By now she was dressed
to the T's. and she'd become the…

197
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.920
The sex symbol of this country.

198
00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.960
And it wasn't…
It wasn't just a sex thing at all.

199
00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.920
Women felt just the same as men.

200
00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:39.600
There was something deeply moving
about Marilyn. always.

201
00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.880
We were close during the picture.

202
00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:47.560
and then we were… we. you know.
considered ourselves friends.

203
00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.800
but Marilyn kind of went
from one group to another.

204
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.680
She would take off.
and it would be another group.

205
00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.240
That would become the shell for a time.

206
00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.800
She didn't go back
and seek out any of the people

207
00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.680
that had become close to her.

208
00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.280
There was something
so vulnerable. so…

209
00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.360
Something you felt

210
00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.400
could be easily destroyed.

211
00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.240
- Hello?
- Hi.

212
00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.920
Well. I hated Hollywood.
My family knew enough Hollywood people.

213
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.960
You know. I had. at times.
met movie stars at parties

214
00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:18.720
and found the whole thing to be obnoxious.

215
00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:23.400
My notion was these people were…
were phoneys and narcissistic characters.

216
00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:24.440
I hated 'em.

217
00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.560
So when I heard
that Dad was seeing Marilyn.

218
00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.280
I was not jumping up and down
and cheering.

219
00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.600
He couldn't see her at the office.
She was too goddamn famous.

220
00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.720
He was seeing her at home.
I thought. "What a bunch of bullshit."

221
00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.520
I mean.
here's the sex symbol of the world.

222
00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.560
Here is. you know.
what womanhood should be in a nutshell.

223
00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.160
I mean.
there was something about Marilyn

224
00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.400
-that put her apart from everybody else.
- Yeah.

225
00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:57.280
But there were times. you know. that
I would pick her up in my Hillman Minx.

226
00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.600
-you know. and…
- Yeah.

227
00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:04.800
Marilyn without makeup and a scarf
over her hair and just sitting there.

228
00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.880
you know. you wouldn't think
would attract any kind of attention.

229
00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:12.640
and yet. you know. I would suddenly
have five people washing my windows.

230
00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.720
-But there was just something.
- Yeah.

231
00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:15.960
It happened to me too.

232
00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:18.760
No! No!

233
00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:22.360
There was an at-homeness
with her body

234
00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:26.240
that very…
I have never seen anybody else have.

235
00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:29.240
To be sort of almost animallike

236
00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.320
in their feel and their movement and…

237
00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:36.600
You know. beautiful
and very. in a sense. poetic.

238
00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.280
And I'm not calling myself an orphan.

239
00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:47.960
I was brought up a waif.

240
00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.080
Yeah. I was never used to being happy.

241
00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:57.320
So that wasn't something
I was sort of counting on.

242
00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:11.600
In all the years
he'd been doing that.

243
00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.000
my father had never had
a patient commit suicide.

244
00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.360
He never treated anybody
as unorthodoxly as he was treating her.

245
00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:22.040
His feeling was that because of who
she was. she could never be hospitalized.

246
00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.520
So given that he couldn't do that.

247
00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.320
his feeling was the best shot he had

248
00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.320
was to try to treat her
in this highly unusual.

249
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.440
unorthodox kind of way that he did.

250
00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.080
She starts hanging out with the family.

251
00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:38.720
That's how a sort of more
of a friendliness then came about.

252
00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.520
Before dinner. they would have cocktails.

253
00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.760
And that would be where the sort of
predinner conversation would go on.

254
00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:49.240
She had a… a mind that searched

255
00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:54.920
and an honest mind that tried
to find whatever her truths were.

256
00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:58.200
It must have been
somewhere along the line

257
00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:00.000
that I began to talk to her.

258
00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:04.520
And it was in that particular setting
that I slowly but surely got to know her.

259
00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.360
because I certainly know
that my opinion changes.

260
00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.960
Within that family.
I was the new arrived left-winger.

261
00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.720
So. but we'd get into these conversations.

262
00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.360
and lo and behold. you know.
Marilyn would end up on my side.

263
00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.080
- Right.
- So a friendship developed.

264
00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.680
I began to like her and to recognize
that there was more to this person

265
00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:25.200
than. uh… than met the eye.

266
00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:30.200
Well. Marilyn told me that
there was a new man in her life.

267
00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.640
No. that he was just. you know…
you know. really terrific.

268
00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.960
-Neat.
-And he was really neat

269
00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.520
and. you know. cute and…

270
00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:41.960
I mean. it was that kind of…
I mean. I remember--

271
00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.840
-It was girly talk.
- It was girly talk.

272
00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.160
I mean. the…

273
00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:49.240
She said that this person was so important
that she wouldn't tell me who it was.

274
00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.840
Calling him "the general."

275
00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.000
She was calling him "the general."

276
00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.920
-The general.
-

277
00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.840
And I remember feeling
that it was real…

278
00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:17.880
You know. it was real peculiar that
here I'm sitting with Marilyn Monroe.

279
00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:21.680
We're talking about boyfriends. and
I'm meeting some schlub at art school.

280
00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:25.800
I know that she's talking about somebody
that's very big in the government.

281
00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:28.200
And… and it sort of struck me as…

282
00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:31.160
- Somehow this is bizarre.
- You mean. you knew already--

283
00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.520
So I didn't know whether
it was Bobby or the president.

284
00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.720
- Yeah.
- It was simply titillating.

285
00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.920
I mean. I don't even remember
the guy I had a crush on back then.

286
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.440
but it was certainly somebody
that wasn't gonna hold a candle to that.

287
00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.520
Yeah.

288
00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.960
There was more
to this person than met the eye.

289
00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:08.640
Family.

290
00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:14.120
The general.

291
00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:17.600
This person was so important.

292
00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:43.560
Joe DiMaggio!
Smacked one out of the park!

293
00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:47.000
What a hit!
Into the upper deck in left center field!

294
00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.520
He was a wonderful athlete.

295
00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.800
DiMaggio connects.

296
00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:59.320
I met him…
he had already retired.

297
00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.640
I had very few friends.

298
00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:15.840
It's just that

299
00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:18.920
I like people.

300
00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:22.800
but for friends. I like few people.

301
00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:31.560
But I think she was
quite taken with DiMaggio.

302
00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:37.040
I saw him for around a year
and a half. two years. and we married.

303
00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.360
Romance that thrills the world!

304
00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.360
The marriage of Marilyn Monroe
and Joe DiMaggio.

305
00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.840
The girl who starred in
How to Marry a Millionaire.

306
00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:52.520
giving another starring performance
in How to Marry a Baseball Hero.

307
00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.600
and now the pair are off
for their happy honeymoon.

308
00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:04.840
He understood
some things about me. and…

309
00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.520
I understood some things about him.

310
00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:14.520
We based our marriage on it.

311
00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:18.360
And I say some things.

312
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.880
How have you and Mrs. DiMaggio
enjoyed your trip to Japan?

313
00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.800
Everything has been fine.
We've enjoyed our trip.

314
00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:34.000
The only thing that I have to complain
about is I haven't seen much of Marilyn.

315
00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.520
She is making a trip to Korea.

316
00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.720
touring through the camps and so.

317
00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.680
maybe after that we'll be able
to spend a little time together.

318
00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:57.440
I mean. I really don't think
they had a lot in common.

319
00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:03.200
I think she was very touched
by his genuine concern for her.

320
00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.440
But then quite soon bored…

321
00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:11.080
with his over-possessiveness.

322
00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.560
Well. we're here to make
The Seven Year Itch.

323
00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:15.360
- That's your latest picture?
-Yes.

324
00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.600
I'm looking forward
to working in it very much.

325
00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.120
I hear that you're getting
to be quite a cook too.

326
00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.400
Joe says you can
really broil a mean steak.

327
00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.320
Well. I'm learning.

328
00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.960
A little slow. but…

329
00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.520
Okay.

330
00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.560
We were shooting
Seven Year Itch with Marilyn Monroe.

331
00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:00.760
And do you remember that famous shot?

332
00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.960
Do you remember the wind
that is lifting her skirt?

333
00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.520
Do you feel the breeze from the subway?

334
00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.880
Isn't it delicious?

335
00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.360
Oh! Here comes another one!

336
00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.200
Well. we were all set up
to shoot that scene. you know.

337
00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:25.760
There were five
and ultimately 10.000 people.

338
00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:30.680
They were like. uh…
and look up Marilyn's skirt.

339
00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:32.880
And…

340
00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.280
people were heckling from the sidelines.

341
00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.560
and people were running up for autographs.

342
00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.480
I did Seven Year Itch.

343
00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.320
Yeah.
Joe got very upset about it.

344
00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.720
- Did he really or was that--
- Really!

345
00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:03.840
Joe DiMaggio. you know.
he was watching it.

346
00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.440
and he didn't like it very much.

347
00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:08.480
his wife making a spectacle of herself.

348
00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:15.440
They had a suite
in a real old. beautiful hotel.

349
00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:20.600
-And he… beat her up a little bit.
- Huh.

350
00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:23.440
Marilyn said
that she screamed and yelled for us.

351
00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:27.200
But we couldn't hear her
through those thick walls. you know.

352
00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.960
- It was more on her shoulders.
- Yeah.

353
00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:37.440
But with a little makeup and everything.
she went ahead and worked.

354
00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:44.040
Our marriage wasn't a happy one.
It ended in.

355
00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.040
uh. nine months.

356
00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.480
unfortunately.

357
00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.400
I don't know what else to say.

358
00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:00.640
All I can say as her attorney is that

359
00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:04.720
this is what we would say
was a conflict of careers.

360
00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.880
Has Joe moved out finally?

361
00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:15.480
- Okay. Jerry!
-I'm sorry. I have to go.

362
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.360
My dad had told me…

363
00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.240
that she got depressed at times.

364
00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:32.920
About how terrible she felt about herself.

365
00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.680
"Nothing would ever turn out right."

366
00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:40.160
"Nothing would go my way."

367
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.360
How do you feel about
coming back to Hollywood?

368
00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.120
A happy time for you--

369
00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:50.000
Yes. it is. It's a very happy time.
I'm happy to be back.

370
00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.000
-In my hometown.
- Yes.

371
00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.840
Well.
you're a happy girl now?

372
00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:01.160
And she talked about this
whole litany of depressive thought.

373
00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:03.080
"Nobody likes me."

374
00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:06.200
"Everything I do turns to shit."

375
00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.280
"I don't have anybody."

376
00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.000
"I'm a waif."

377
00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:13.480
Marilyn.
all we know in New York

378
00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:16.520
is that you and Joe DiMaggio
are friends at a distance.

379
00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:17.960
How great a distance?

380
00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.320
Well. we haven't seen each other.

381
00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:24.360
Do you hear from each other?
Do you write or talk?

382
00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:27.800
-Um. I'd rather not answer.
- All right. fine.

383
00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:56.680
Well. when I was put
in the orphans' home.

384
00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:01.480
they pulled me. and I kept crying
and screaming. "I'm not an orphan."

385
00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:08.040
I called every woman I would see.
I'd say. "There's a mama."

386
00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:11.880
If I would see a man.
I'd say. "There's a daddy."

387
00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:19.800
I don't think I have
really too much to say about it except

388
00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:23.000
I… I liked her. and…

389
00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.360
and we'd talk a lot.

390
00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:35.080
I was at the Strasbergs' parties
with her a lot.

391
00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:43.920
She… she seemed a little bit. um…

392
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.240
She seemed concerned about. uh.

393
00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:49.120
you know. like childhood memories of…

394
00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.880
of being molested as a child.
things like that.

395
00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.800
She talked about that. I remember.

396
00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.800
She felt that she had avoided…

397
00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:02.280
That she knew people
who were psychotic from such episodes.

398
00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:05.360
and she felt that at least
she'd survived that.

399
00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:32.600
-
- I was a very. very close friend

400
00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:35.360
and was friends to the end.

401
00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:46.840
She wanted to know her father
so badly.

402
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.080
I remember a party
and this game we'd play.

403
00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:56.000
Everybody said what
they'd want most in the world.

404
00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:00.480
And she said she'd want
to put on a black wig.

405
00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:02.480
pick up her father at a bar.

406
00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.400
have him make love to her.

407
00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:11.240
and then she'd say. "Well. how does
it feel now to have a daughter

408
00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.600
that you've made love to?"

409
00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:18.200
We all need to get out
of childhood in one piece.

410
00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:22.000
but if nowhere along the line
did you get that sort of reinforcement

411
00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:25.480
that you are worth love. you're lovable.
that there's something in you.

412
00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:27.080
that we're a good person.

413
00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:29.720
what you end up with
is a sort of emptiness.

414
00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:56.880
We were friends prior to the marriage.

415
00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.160
Many years before that.

416
00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:08.040
See. my father owned half
of Republic Studios at one time.

417
00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:10.360
-So I grew up with these people.
- Uh-huh.

418
00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:14.280
But. uh. I think the greatest effect
of all was Arthur Miller.

419
00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:16.720
Yes.

420
00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:20.080
The Arthur Miller situation.

421
00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:37.760
How long have you known
Miss Monroe. Mr. Miller?

422
00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:42.000
I met her a long time ago.
but I hadn't seen her in years.

423
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.440
But I think I've got the woman
who is going to be my wife.

424
00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.600
- You mean Marilyn Monroe?
-That's correct.

425
00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.800
When are you planning
to have children?

426
00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:54.920
Well. I'm not married yet. dear.

427
00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:57.960
This is a personal question.

428
00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:01.080
Is there anything in particular
about Mr. Miller that attracted you?

429
00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:02.600
-Have you seen him?
- Yes.

430
00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:04.160
-Yes!
-

431
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.400
I think she was quite intrigued
by people she thought to be bright.

432
00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.360
That would have been my impression.

433
00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:41.960
What I'd like to accomplish.
I would like to be a good actress.

434
00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:46.000
A true actress. An artist. with integrity.

435
00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:58.520
She had very strong goals
for herself.

436
00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:01.400
She was so bright about acting.

437
00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:07.400
She'd come over. sit with me
at the Studio and things like that.

438
00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:09.880
She'd figure out what
she wanted to do with the scene.

439
00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:14.040
She really… she really cared.

440
00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:19.400
I think love and work are
the only things that really happen to us.

441
00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:24.840
Arthur Miller thought
she was intelligent

442
00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:29.200
and had a brain that was never cultivated.

443
00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:31.760
And that's where he courted her.

444
00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:37.880
- That's correct.
-

445
00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:01.120
Ms. Monroe. could you tell us
what kind of a wedding you're gonna have?

446
00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:03.480
Very quiet. I hope.

447
00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.000
Studio.

448
00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:57.520
- Can I speak to Milton Greene?
- Speaking.

449
00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:15.000
Close friend and associate.
We loved each other. period.

450
00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:25.960
She was. She really was.
She wanted a baby.

451
00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:28.480
In fact. during Prince and the Showgirl.

452
00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:31.800
she said. when it's over.
she's gonna go home and have a baby.

453
00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:33.600
And I said. "Well. great."

454
00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:36.400
"Get the white picket fence.
and I think it's a good idea."

455
00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:45.840
If you gave her a choice
between children and stardom.

456
00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:47.320
it would have been children…

457
00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:49.920
without question.

458
00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:58.360
There were some photographs.

459
00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:01.480
I think it was a picture of her
and Miller's father.

460
00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:03.320
And she said to me.

461
00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.400
"This is my happiest period."

462
00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:07.000
And I asked her why.

463
00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:09.760
She showed me the picture
and said. "I was pregnant then."

464
00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:16.840
Yes. she was pregnant by Miller
during Some Like It Hot.

465
00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:36.760
If you watched her

466
00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:40.200
in the picture that I worked
with her on called Some Like It Hot…

467
00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:43.280
- Right. One of my favorites.
- She was so wonderful.

468
00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:53.720
All the way through.

469
00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:56.040
- From the start? Gosh.
-Yes.

470
00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:04.160
She had a very naive quality
about her. very soft. gentle quality.

471
00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:15.800
That's the way she could be.
you see.

472
00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:22.960
That's the way she was.
not could be. She was evanescent.

473
00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:27.040
-♪ To anything higher… ♪
-And I…

474
00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:32.480
Well. uh. she wasn't happy many times.
Mr. Summers.

475
00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:34.080
I… I remember…

476
00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:56.920
Everything connects in a person's life.
particularly hers. you know?

477
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.120
And it's sad.

478
00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:04.040
She was slightly
discombobulated at all times.

479
00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:07.200
But by God.
when you suffered through that scene.

480
00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.760
through the 30. 40. 50 takes sometimes.

481
00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:11.480
you had something there. you know.

482
00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:14.640
Something absolutely unique
that cannot be duplicated.

483
00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:17.920
I had no problem with Monroe.
Monroe had problems with Monroe.

484
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000
She had problems with herself.

485
00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:23.320
I can give you the reason
for that one.

486
00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:26.120
But I can't say anything.
And I knew it all.

487
00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:28.080
I'm awfully sorry.

488
00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:32.280
You sound very nice. but I really…
It makes me unhappy to talk about it.

489
00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:33.480
It really does.

490
00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:36.800
- You know you--
- She's been gone 20 years…

491
00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:38.360
- Oh yes.
-…Mr. Summers.

492
00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:43.000
I can't bring myself
to talk about it.

493
00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:53.480
Just being able to be

494
00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:55.960
another human being.

495
00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.520
to be someplace…

496
00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:04.920
Having certain kinds
of secrets for yourself.

497
00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:11.960
There is a need for aloneness. you know?

498
00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:29.520
I was aware from the--
Yes. I was aware from the beginning.

499
00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:33.240
And I saw there was
something that she was…

500
00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:36.760
She was not the fresh little girl
that I'd known originally.

501
00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:40.760
Very soon we were aware
that she was a problem.

502
00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:45.240
She'd be late on the set always.

503
00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:48.680
Sometimes the whole morning would go by.

504
00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:50.880
Sometimes she'd be all right.

505
00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:55.480
Occasionally.
she'd be practically non compos mentis.

506
00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:59.360
The narcotics were the problem.

507
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.120
I discovered this
in the course of the picture.

508
00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:27.120
I remember saying to Miller one day…

509
00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:32.880
I said. you know. that if she went
on at the rate that she was going.

510
00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:38.640
why. she'd be in an institution
in two or three years. or dead!

511
00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:44.640
And I said anyone who allows her
to take a drug ought to be shot.

512
00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:48.960
It was almost an accusation against him.

513
00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:51.640
An indictment against Miller.

514
00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:58.600
At the end of the shooting of Misfits.

515
00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:09.880
Happiness…

516
00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:16.680
Does one ever know that?

517
00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:43.640
Marilyn!

518
00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:53.440
Marilyn!

519
00:50:58.120 --> 00:50:59.680
I feel wonderful. Thank you.

520
00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:49.560
Here she was now.
again divorced and terribly lonely.

521
00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:59.000
That's when the Kennedys
came back in there.

522
00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:04.520
- Right.
-

523
00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:07.000
- Were you aware of that?
- Oh. yes.

524
00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:11.440
But Jack.
that started in the early and mid '50s.

525
00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:14.840
-Yes!
- Uh-huh.

526
00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:16.440
Oh. of course it did.

527
00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:24.800
He'd been out here
on and off all through the '50s.

528
00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:27.400
'Cause he had lots of friends here.
you know.

529
00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:29.800
spending lots of time. you know.

530
00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:32.240
- He used the Malibu Inn.
- Yes.

531
00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:35.080
- And drank at the Malibu Cottage.
- Uh-huh.

532
00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:38.480
The raunchiest looking thing
you've ever seen in your life.

533
00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:46.080
-Oh yeah. because Jack wasn't known…
- Yeah.

534
00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:47.040
…here at all.

535
00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:49.960
He was a senator.
He was totally unknown here.

536
00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:52.960
I. John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
do solemnly swear…

537
00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:56.480
No one ever expected Jack to
become the president or the nominee.

538
00:52:56.560 --> 00:53:00.120
…and I will faithfully execute the office
of President of the United States.

539
00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:02.000
And will to the best of your ability…

540
00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:06.080
He's just some smart-ass
rich kid's son that became senator.

541
00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:10.280
Preserve. protect and defend
the Constitution of the United States.

542
00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:11.560
So help you God.

543
00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:12.920
So help me God.

544
00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:20.080
After Jack.

545
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:27.400
Ah. yes.

546
00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:29.240
Yes.

547
00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:34.600
But. in '61.

548
00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:41.640
the meeting headquarters
was at Pete Lawford's house

549
00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:43.520
in Malibu.

550
00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:30.320
Just the things
that were going on in that beach house.

551
00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:36.280
Not discreet at all.

552
00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:40.480
Of course. there was nothing discreet
about any of the Kennedys either.

553
00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:50.360
Mm-hmm.
I mean. it was just mind-boggling.

554
00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:56.840
Peter would obviously be. you know.
sort of pimping for both Kennedys.

555
00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:00.440
They would do it
just as soon in front of anybody.

556
00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:02.920
Yeah. their wives
could be in the other room.

557
00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:05.680
and many times were. you know.

558
00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:10.760
Yeah. I mean.
I've had a hand up my breasts.

559
00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:13.920
The president owned it.

560
00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:17.480
Yeah.

561
00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:20.040
Not in the terms that Jack was.

562
00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:23.840
They were tacky. they were corny.
they were… you know. the father was.

563
00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:26.800
They were chips off the old block.

564
00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:43.160
You know. his father
was a bigger wolf than he was!

565
00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:50.280
He came out here.
and he had an office here.

566
00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:54.000
which later became RKO.

567
00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:57.600
See. before. any con artist could come
into the motion picture industry

568
00:55:57.680 --> 00:55:58.560
and make a buck.

569
00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:02.760
And he used to fuck up in his office.

570
00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:05.520
I used to have to wait outside the door.
for chrissakes.

571
00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:07.040
while he was getting laid.

572
00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:09.120
I mean. I'm talking about Joe.

573
00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:14.440
Yeah.

574
00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:15.800
Remember that.

575
00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:22.920
Both.

576
00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:27.040
I do.

577
00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:29.920
It was in the dining room one day.

578
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.280
and she was talking about
going over to Lawford's house.

579
00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:34.240
"I want something to talk to him about."

580
00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:35.760
- Robert Kennedy?
-Right.

581
00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:39.360
We talked about some political questions.
She actually ended up writing them down

582
00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:42.560
and putting them in her purse.
and then she went there.

583
00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:44.840
She was seated with Bobby

584
00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:47.600
and had made some little notes.

585
00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:51.160
feeling that she really wasn't
quite bright enough for the crowd.

586
00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:53.320
And. um. at one point.

587
00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:56.760
he got up and called
his father long-distance

588
00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:59.120
to say that he was seated
with Marilyn Monroe.

589
00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:01.680
and would his father
like to say hello to Marilyn.

590
00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:03.320
- Who?
-This is Bobby.

591
00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:05.920
And I think he asked her to dance.

592
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.160
They did that.

593
00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:13.440
-That goes on…
- Yes. that's what she said

594
00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:15.880
on numerous occasions.

595
00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:19.280
Again. she just didn't lie.
She just spoke quite openly.

596
00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:25.400
Oh. nothing but love.

597
00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:28.040
Nothing but admiration.

598
00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:51.720
Tonight. we go after
the story of a private detective.

599
00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:55.840
who helps Confidential magazine
pry into the lives of Hollywood stars.

600
00:57:55.920 --> 00:58:00.440
An ex-cop. now one of the highest-paid
private detectives in the United States.

601
00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:01.920
He's Fred Otash.

602
00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:07.560
Now then. Fred Otash. you take any case
that pays you money. is that not so?

603
00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:09.360
-Correct?
-That's correct.

604
00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:10.480
Any case at all?

605
00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:16.520
I won't take a case for a member
of the Communist Party or a communist.

606
00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:18.560
I sort of draw the line there.

607
00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:24.120
How do you justify
invading people's privacy like that?

608
00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:28.400
Well. I feel this way.
if you can see it or hear it.

609
00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:30.560
you're not invading any privacy.

610
00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:37.400
Being a private detective is a dirty job.
There's no two ways about it.

611
00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:38.840
But I do a certain job.

612
00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:42.240
and I try to determine
if the facts and the items are true.

613
00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:45.480
- You just want the facts?
-That's right. The true facts.

614
00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:56.640
- Fred Otash?
- Yeah.

615
00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:04.280
I worked for and against the Mafia.
I worked for and against law enforcement.

616
00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:06.760
I worked for and against the White House.

617
00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:09.600
And I worked for Hoffa.

618
00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:28.760
You can't be head of the Teamsters
unless you're approved by the Mob.

619
00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:30.360
Hoffa was the Mob.

620
00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:40.920
- Where'd you get the money?
- What'd you say?

621
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.760
Do you have any evidence
of the $20.000 in cash?

622
00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:46.120
- No.
-Did you receive any of this money?

623
00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:47.400
I don't believe that I did.

624
00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:50.240
Suggest anything to you?

625
00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:53.600
It doesn't suggest anything
except the fact that you're trying again

626
00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:55.080
to embarrass Hoffa. That's all.

627
00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:59.280
Hoffa. he had a vendetta for Bobby.
Kennedy had a vendetta for Hoffa.

628
00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:02.880
Mr. Hoffa. did you say.
"That SOB. I'll break his back."

629
01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:05.040
Figure of speech.
I don't know who I was talking about.

630
01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:06.640
I don't know what you're talking about.

631
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.360
Hoffa wanted to neutralize Kennedy.

632
01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:18.720
What Hoffa wanted

633
01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:23.480
was for me to develop a derogatory profile
on Jack and Bobby Kennedy

634
01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:25.520
and their relationships
with Marilyn Monroe.

635
01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:31.160
And the strategy that was agreed upon
was to use electronic devices.

636
01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:33.800
and the most logical place
to set those devices

637
01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:35.720
was Peter Lawford's home in Malibu.

638
01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:38.840
That was the Kennedy playground.

639
01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:42.400
And wire up Marilyn's home…

640
01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:44.800
in Brentwood.

641
01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:53.160
The house on the Helenas
was the first piece of property that she

642
01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.080
ever had owned in her whole life.

643
01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:57.920
And my father encouraged
the whole idea that

644
01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:04.200
she alone as a person could own
and put down roots and have her own place.

645
01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:06.400
It was something
that hadn't occurred to her.

646
01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:12.280
And she was. you know. very excited
about establishing her own sort of family.

647
01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:17.640
What Pop wanted to do was
to have her stand on her own two feet.

648
01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:24.080
But there is something
in people. they want solitude for a while.

649
01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:27.880
That I'm quiet and to myself more.

650
01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:31.840
Somewhere in there.
my dad went away.

651
01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:33.360
- Yeah.
- To Europe.

652
01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:36.080
And he left with her
in fairly decent shape.

653
01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.160
But I think she was starting that movie.

654
01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:46.680
In a sense. the less important
we became in her life. the better off.

655
01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:49.760
That meant that she had her own life.

656
01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:54.200
- All right. camera!
- It's 11.

657
01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.920
It takes me two seconds. It's taken…

658
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.400
You've… you've had two days.
Sorry. George. but we can do it.

659
01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:04.160
Good. good. good.

660
01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:06.160
All right. cameras!

661
01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:12.200
Yeah. one more.
That was good though. right?

662
01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:19.520
And she would become even more of a star.

663
01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:27.040
I'd have to look into my journal
and see what he said.

664
01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:29.800
-if I wrote it down as a quote.
- I'd be interested in that.

665
01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:32.080
This is a quote.
"Marilyn will turn out to be

666
01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:35.400
the most popular actress of
her generation. probably of this century."

667
01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:38.200
502. Speed.

668
01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:42.040
Mr. Cukor.
on this film. has been

669
01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:45.160
very wonderful to me.

670
01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:51.880
Trying to be happy is almost as difficult
as trying to be a good actress.

671
01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:54.240
You have to work at both of them.

672
01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:56.880
"Her best films
would have come late in her career."

673
01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:59.280
"She had a great untapped
dramatic talent."

674
01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:07.720
But anyway. she was making that movie.
and… my dad. when he left said.

675
01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:09.840
"You guys should try to pitch in."

676
01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:14.200
He wanted to make sure that
she wasn't running into some trouble.

677
01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:19.600
There was always
great danger that she might…

678
01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:23.760
get involved with somebody or something.

679
01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:36.320
The bugs were installed
in the bedrooms and on the phones.

680
01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:41.400
And there were four bugs
altogether installed out there.

681
01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:45.800
They were placed under carpets.

682
01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:49.360
in the chandeliers.
and in ceiling fixtures.

683
01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:53.880
You could wire a telephone
five miles from the location.

684
01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:57.200
I had sent Danoff out there.

685
01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:58.200
John Danoff.

686
01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:05.960
Yes.

687
01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:14.640
The conversation
that came across the receiver.

688
01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:16.880
it would fade in and fade out.

689
01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:23.280
Music. people talking.

690
01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:26.960
and I'm then beginning
to recognize the voices.

691
01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:30.320
the Bostonian accent and Marilyn Monroe.

692
01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:33.440
I heard the president
call Marilyn "Marilyn."

693
01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:36.560
or Marilyn calling the president "Prez."

694
01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:39.240
Any conversations on the phone.

695
01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:41.160
some with Jack Kennedy.
some with Bobby Kennedy.

696
01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:43.080
some with Monroe. some with other people.

697
01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:45.960
Arrangements for meetings.
there were gonna be rendezvous

698
01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:50.160
with Jack Kennedy.
Bobby Kennedy. and Monroe.

699
01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:55.200
So there were numerous tapes made
on Marilyn and Jack at the beach house

700
01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:56.760
in the act of lovemaking.

701
01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:59.960
They went into the bedroom
where there was another transmitter.

702
01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:03.680
which picked up cuddly talk
and taking off her clothes.

703
01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:05.640
the sex act in the bed.

704
01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:10.440
And someone wired up Marilyn's house

705
01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:11.880
on behalf of Hoffa.

706
01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:15.080
Bobby Kennedy was there many times.

707
01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:19.040
There were more tapes
made out of Robert Kennedy and Monroe.

708
01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:21.800
as opposed to Jack Kennedy and Monroe.

709
01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:38.280
This is in '62.
shortly before her death.

710
01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:39.920
It must have been that summer.

711
01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:45.520
Whenever she called.

712
01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:49.600
and I would always answer
the attorney general's personal calls.

713
01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:51.560
she would talk to me.

714
01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:53.760
It was as though she were reaching out.

715
01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:57.760
And Bob would call her back.
and they'd talk.

716
01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:37.920
The entire globe.

717
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.320
yesterday. the site
of a momentous conflict.

718
01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:43.880
The conflict which
has become known as the Cold War.

719
01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:51.640
The Communist Bloc
would like to see the world

720
01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:53.160
under communist domination.

721
01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:56.200
Recently. we've seen it
extend into turbulent Cuba.

722
01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:58.520
Does that disturb you? It should.

723
01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:03.400
You are in the crosshairs
of the bombsight.

724
01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:06.280
A massive nuclear
intercontinental capability.

725
01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:08.520
The communist plan for world domination.

726
01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:13.200
It is a contest unlike any we have ever
faced in our history as a nation.

727
01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:02.120
I remember
when she sang for the president.

728
01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:07.680
And she was so excited about it.

729
01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:12.920
'Cause. "Why. the president
of the United States." you know.

730
01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:17.200
You know. it was one of the most
exciting things of her life.

731
01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:21.960
President is winding up his New York day
here at Madison Square Garden

732
01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:24.840
in a sort of pre-birthday celebration.

733
01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:28.320
Mr. Kennedy has the best seat
in the house at the function.

734
01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:32.520
and it will be starting just about now.
the finale for this affair.

735
01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:35.840
Mr. President.

736
01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:41.600
on this occasion of your birthday.
this lovely lady. Marilyn Monroe.

737
01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:18.520
Everybody! Happy birthday!

738
01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:23.240
Just being the one to sing.

739
01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:26.800
She was picked.

740
01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:33.360
-
- She was picked.

741
01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:35.800
The one.

742
01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:47.280
We met in Laguna.

743
01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:53.680
A month before she died.

744
01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:58.960
She came down for the weekend.

745
01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:02.760
And… she told us the…

746
01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:05.520
What had really taken place
with the Kennedys.

747
01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:09.240
I can…
You know. I can go into the dirt.

748
01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:11.920
or I can go into lots of other things.

749
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.240
but she… She was…

750
01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:17.480
She was. uh. hurt.

751
01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:22.960
Terribly hurt when…
…she was told directly

752
01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:25.920
never to call or contact again.

753
01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:29.720
-Robert or John.
- Right.

754
01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:35.440
Well. no. that was an order.

755
01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:41.600
- No. Jack didn't contact her.
- Yeah.

756
01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:42.800
Bob did.

757
01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:45.600
And that's what killed her.

758
01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:50.920
I don't care
what anyone else says.

759
01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.080
It was the beginning of the last day.
if you will.

760
01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:04.920
Prior to her death?

761
01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:10.640
She had been mixing drink
and sleeping pills.

762
01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:18.040
I thought she very definitely
was on the downward path.

763
01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:23.360
And I just never could
quite understand whether

764
01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:27.000
she understood there was help to be had

765
01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:29.200
and people did care about her.

766
01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:32.000
And whether she was just…

767
01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:35.280
letting go.

768
01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:40.400
I like to stay here and now.

769
01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:42.840
Fame is fickle.

770
01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.920
It had its compensation.

771
01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:52.200
But… it also has its drawbacks.

772
01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:56.400
And I know it.

773
01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:00.880
I've had you. fame.

774
01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:04.480
So long!

775
01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:16.600
One of the most famous stars
in Hollywood history is dead at 36.

776
01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:25.640
Her housekeeper. Eunice Murray.

777
01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:27.720
found the actress dead in bed.

778
01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:32.000
holding in one hand a telephone.
which was off its hook.

779
01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:35.000
Bottle of sleeping pills near her bed.

780
01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:38.120
No notes were found.

781
01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:42.640
The coroner ruled
the cause of death an overdose of drugs.

782
01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:46.000
It is our opinion. probable suicide.

783
01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:50.440
Well. the official finding
will never tell the story

784
01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:53.200
of her life and end.

785
01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:31.240
I will never forget that night

786
01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:33.720
because we were at the Hollywood Bowl.

787
01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:38.000
and someone. I don't know who it was.
that came to us.

788
01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:40.800
and all I remember
is that we were no longer

789
01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:43.000
at the Hollywood Bowl.
if you know what I mean.

790
01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:48.680
About half past ten.

791
01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:53.320
-Exactly.
- Right.

792
01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:16.960
That's not true
because my husband was there.

793
01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:20.680
That's correct.

794
01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:24.840
- Remember. the official story--
-My husband fudged everything off.

795
01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:29.000
I cannot tell you why because
he's no longer with us. as you know.

796
01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:31.960
- He didn't tell you why--
-Don't forget. that was his business.

797
01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:35.600
To keep the press at bay.
He kept everyone in abeyance.

798
01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:42.680
- What happened?
- What do you mean?

799
01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:44.280
Did you go into the house?

800
01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:48.120
- Yeah.
- Did you see Monroe's body?

801
01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:50.360
Yeah. she was on the bed.

802
01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:52.800
Do you recall whether she was
on her back or stomach?

803
01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:53.800
Side.

804
01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:55.720
- She was on her side.
- Yes.

805
01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:11.920
Yeah?

806
01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:23.840
- Yeah.
- Do you know where it took her?

807
01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:26.000
Took her to Santa Monica emergency.

808
01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:33.360
No. she wasn't.

809
01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:37.920
Yes. that's right.

810
01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:41.720
Yeah.

811
01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:46.360
-comatose. to the hospital…
- Right.

812
01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:50.160
It's the truth.

813
01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:09.080
- The other people involved.
- Involved.

814
01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:10.880
I don't know who was involved.

815
01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.960
Greenson and I were both at a… at a lunch.

816
01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:29.040
I was sitting next to him at the table.

817
01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:30.360
- Yes.
- And…

818
01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:34.160
This is after she died.
'64. somewhere like that.

819
01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:35.960
Quite closely related to her death.

820
01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:48.120
They took her to St. John's.

821
01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:52.320
And that she died in the ambulance.

822
01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:55.280
Then they took her back to the house.
That was what he told me.

823
01:21:58.440 --> 01:21:59.280
Right…

824
01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:05.160
Yeah. he did!
He told me that he was in the ambulance.

825
01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:15.280
Yeah. I just don't feel comfortable
telling you what he told me.

826
01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:23.160
This sort of thing was not talked about.

827
01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:25.920
-People of that magnitude.
- Yeah.

828
01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.320
Also. he wouldn't want to burden me with

829
01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:32.320
a knowledge
that I would then have to hide.

830
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:45.840
Hello?

831
01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:47.880
Yes. Tony.

832
01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:57.640
I don't want to go through it
with Marilyn again because. uh…

833
01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:12.160
Listen. I don't know really anything
else that I feel that I ought to do.

834
01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:14.520
-Tony!
- Yeah?

835
01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:18.280
This has not had any interest
for me in a long time.

836
01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:21.840
I went in. did my number. took my money
and got out of the business!

837
01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:27.120
Find out where
Bobby Kennedy was that weekend.

838
01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:41.920
Do you wanna ask me something or--

839
01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:57.680
Yeah. I had heard.

840
01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:02.920
on good authority.
that the Saturday that this happened.

841
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.400
Bobby had come into town.

842
01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:06.920
Bobby was in town and supposedly left.

843
01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:11.600
And when I say I heard it.
I heard it from a federal agent.

844
01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:16.880
Yes.
It was definitely from the FBI.

845
01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:25.280
I think he was at Peter's house
at the beach.

846
01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:27.440
Yeah. that's what I…

847
01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:32.040
In fact. I…
I must say. yes. I… I do remember that.

848
01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:33.440
-He was.
- Right.

849
01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:35.760
-He was at Peter's house at the beach.
- Right.

850
01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.680
Well. I hope your phone is clean.

851
01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:16.680
- Which is a good question.
- Yes.

852
01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:26.680
Did Freddy. uh. corroborate?
And if you don't wanna tell me. okay.

853
01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:28.520
But I can call Fred. He'll tell me.

854
01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:37.600
Well. you're talking to a lot of people.
and. you know.

855
01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:40.560
you're obviously really intent
on getting into this thing.

856
01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:06.080
That Marilyn was murdered is baloney.

857
01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:09.800
- I'll put you straight on it.
- Yeah.

858
01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:12.000
First of all.
what did Freddy tell you?

859
01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:16.120
There were tapes
recorded the day of her death.

860
01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:20.600
Bobby Kennedy called her the night
of her death from Lawford's house.

861
01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:25.120
And she said. you know. "Don't bother me.
Leave me alone. Stay out of my life."

862
01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:29.320
A very violent argument. that. you know.
"I feel passed around. I feel used.

863
01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:31.760
I feel like a piece of meat."

864
01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:39.240
Now. that's true.

865
01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:41.360
-What you just said is true.
- Right.

866
01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:44.440
She was raising a stink.

867
01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:47.880
calling the broth…
Calling John and the White House

868
01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:50.040
and complaining about the situation.

869
01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:53.320
- Because of the brother.
- Yes. The picture that I remember

870
01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:57.960
is that she'd been hot and heavy
for… for Bob.

871
01:26:58.040 --> 01:26:59.600
- Yes.
- At first.

872
01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:05.600
And then. she'd gotten the cold shoulder.
or somehow or other. it had turned.

873
01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:08.240
-Now the details of that. I don't know.
- Right.

874
01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:11.440
But she had come
to the point where she felt like

875
01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:13.480
-she was just being used.
- Yes.

876
01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:17.880
And that's where it was at
about the time the end came.

877
01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:20.800
- Right.
- She was upset and heartbro…

878
01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:23.800
I don't know whether--
I don't think she was heartbroken.

879
01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:26.480
I don't think that it was
a thing of being heartbroken.

880
01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:30.760
It was a thing of feeling
taken advantage of and feeling

881
01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:34.200
a lot of lies
and feeling that she was just being…

882
01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:38.040
Had come to where she said.
you know. "I don't even want to see you."

883
01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:40.840
You know. and. "Why did you come here?"

884
01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:43.600
You know. "If you want to see me.
you come to see me."

885
01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:46.680
-You know. "I'm not coming down there."
- Right.

886
01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:48.360
The call to the White House thing.

887
01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:52.960
I understood it to mean that.
like she was calling to say. you know.

888
01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:55.680
"Get your brother away from me.
I hate all of you."

889
01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:57.320
-That type of thing.
- Right.

890
01:27:57.400 --> 01:27:59.680
There was a turning point
in her feelings.

891
01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:10.480
Like a piece of meat. used. passed around.

892
01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:15.880
I don't think she was heartbroken.

893
01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:17.480
Feeling used.

894
01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:20.800
- "I hate all of you."
-

895
01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:38.080
I appreciate
very much your calling.

896
01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:40.400
I think about you once in a while.

897
01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:52.800
The Kennedys were
a very important part of Marilyn's life.

898
01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:57.120
I wasn't included in this information.
but I was a witness to what was happening.

899
01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:01.840
Yes.

900
01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:04.440
And it became so sticky

901
01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:07.720
that the protectors
of Robert Kennedy. you know.

902
01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:10.600
had to step in there and protect him.

903
01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:21.040
Not an investigation.
but rather a "hush-hush."

904
01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:27.280
Because the man that
really was involved was the boss.

905
01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:30.680
He was the attorney general.
so he could have the FBI do anything.

906
01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:31.640
People that knew.

907
01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:34.920
they knew that they didn't want
Bobby Kennedy's name brought into this.

908
01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.960
again. because his brother was president.

909
01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:40.800
They had done everything to hush this up.

910
01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:57.560
We sort of started
to piece together what happened.

911
01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:02.200
Press accounts were coming out.
and they didn't make a lot of sense to us.

912
01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:04.720
And so we started playing detective.

913
01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:07.880
I pieced together the notion
that a helicopter was used

914
01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:10.920
and went out to see the helicopter pilot.

915
01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:15.480
And I said. "Can I look at your log?
Have you got a log?"

916
01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:16.400
And he said. "Sure!"

917
01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:19.480
And he produced his log.
and I started thumbing through it.

918
01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:21.240
And I saw an entry that said

919
01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:25.800
that he took Kennedy to meet
a flight en route to San Francisco.

920
01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:28.960
Two or three in the morning.

921
01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:35.080
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

922
01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:45.520
Well. also a call was made
to Bobby Kennedy's people.

923
01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:53.320
That's right. and that he had been at the
beach house and that he had flown out.

924
01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:56.200
That that was one reason for the delay.

925
01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:00.360
The message we got back was that Kennedy

926
01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:03.080
would appreciate it
if we didn't do the story.

927
01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.760
We decided that we would
not go with the story.

928
01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:19.960
Uh…
What did Freddy tell you about that?

929
01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:28.080
But I mean. the only people
that would know about that

930
01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:30.120
would be the people at the meeting.

931
01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:47.920
Lawford showed up completely disorientated

932
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:51.360
and in a state of shock.
saying that Marilyn Monroe was dead.

933
01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:53.440
that Bobby Kennedy was there.

934
01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:55.800
that they had gotten in a big fight.

935
01:31:55.880 --> 01:31:59.000
that he was spirited
out of town back up north.

936
01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:02.760
and that he'd like
to have me make arrangements

937
01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:05.160
to have someone go out to the house

938
01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:07.400
and pick up any and all information

939
01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:09.840
that was possible regarding
any involvement

940
01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:12.200
between Marilyn Monroe and the Kennedys.

941
01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:17.480
He was convinced there
was diaries around and maybe a note.

942
01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:00.240
- One moment. please.
-Doyle.

943
01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:11.080
- Yes.
- This had occurred?

944
01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:13.840
- Oh yeah. It did happen.
- Right.

945
01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:16.560
I was there at the time
when she died.

946
01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:19.720
There were some people there that
normally wouldn't have been there.

947
01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:21.280
- Bureau people?
- Yes.

948
01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:27.480
Immediately. Before anybody
even realized what had happened.

949
01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:33.800
It had to be instructions from
someone high up. higher than Hoover.

950
01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:38.320
- The general or the president.
- Yes.

951
01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:39.320
The only two.

952
01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:07.400
She was raising a stink.

953
01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:11.040
She was…

954
01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:15.320
She…

955
01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:51.680
Well. as far as the Los Angeles
District Attorney is concerned.

956
01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:54.680
she killed herself.
either on purpose or accidentally.

957
01:35:55.480 --> 01:35:57.800
The Marilyn Monroe case is closed.

958
01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:06.880
The true things
rarely get into circulation.

959
01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:11.000
It's usually the false things.

960
01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:16.840
It's hard to know where to start
if you don't start with the truth.

961
01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:40.160
I checked the operator for…

962
01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:43.240
-Out of order.
- Hmm.

963
01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:47.440
The operator said
the phone's off the hook.

964
01:36:57.080 --> 01:36:58.560
She was dead…

965
01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:01.960
I've had to live with it…

966
01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:04.440
I should have got in my car
and gone up there.

967
01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:06.640
I should have known better.

968
01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:18.840
When I was a kid.

969
01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:22.160
sitting in the front row…

970
01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:26.840
at the movies on Saturday afternoon…

971
01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:31.680
and I'd think how wonderful
it would be to be an actress.

972
01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:38.280
Everything that I would see.

973
01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:42.240
And…

974
01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:46.440
I…

975
01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:50.800
I wanted to know.

976
01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:57.080
I would like to be a good actress.
