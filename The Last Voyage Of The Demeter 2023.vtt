00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.603
And?

What’s that?

10
00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:54.215
Captain’s log.

as he has abandoned
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hDemeter.

15
00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:10.990
We tried to stop him.

If we didn’t succeed.

17
00:03:13.696 --> 00:03:16.303
God have mercy on your souls.

18
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:23.475
I can’t go back. sir.

Open your ears. men.

00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:23.182
Bound for London.
\hWe pay in gold.

40
00:06:23.182 --> 00:06:24.854
I’m able.

41
00:06:24.854 --> 00:06:26.922
And strong as an ox.

42
00:06:34.897 --> 00:06:36.536
Who are you. boy?

43
00:06:36.536 --> 00:06:38.736
Clemens.

44
00:06:38.736 --> 00:06:41.739
You dress like an educated man.
\h\hWhere did you go to school?

45
00:06:41.739 --> 00:06:43.873
University of Cambridge.

46
00:06:45.072 --> 00:06:48.042
I have a steady hand
with a needle. and. uh...

47
00:06:48.042 --> 00:06:50.484
I have supplies if you’re
in need of a ship doctor.

48
00:06:50.484 --> 00:06:52.079
I-It’s been a while.

49
00:06:52.079 --> 00:06:54.411
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hbut I-I do know
my way around a boat. if not.

50
00:06:54.411 --> 00:06:56.952
\h\hLearning about boats ain’t
the same as keeping one afloat.

51
00:06:56.952 --> 00:07:00.054
\h\hWhat did the sailor
ever learn from a book

52
00:07:00.054 --> 00:07:02.419
that did him an ounce of good
\h\hwhen he was lost at sea?

53
00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:04.828
Astronomy. for one.

54
00:07:05.994 --> 00:07:08.931
\h\h\hCan lose a chart.
You can lose a compass.

55
00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:11.131
But you can’t lose
the stars. can you?

56
00:07:11.131 --> 00:07:14.475
Never met an Englishman in such
\ha hurry to return to England.

57
00:07:14.475 --> 00:07:16.301
Be gone as soon as we reach it.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hno doubt.

58
00:07:18.072 --> 00:07:21.581
We need strong crew.
\h\h\hnot passengers.

59
00:07:22.142 --> 00:07:23.517
Me?

60
00:07:24.914 --> 00:07:26.014
You.

61
00:07:26.014 --> 00:07:28.016
No. never mind you.

62
00:07:50.544 --> 00:07:51.875
\h\h\h\hWOJCHEK:
What’s he saying?

63
00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:54.647
He says they cannot stay.

64
00:07:54.647 --> 00:07:56.176
The hell they can’t.

65
00:07:56.176 --> 00:07:57.881
\hWe need their hands
or we lose the tide.

66
00:07:57.881 --> 00:08:00.015
He says they need to leave
\h\h\hbefore the sun sinks.

67
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:02.886
What kind of nonsense is that?

68
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:11.356
\h\h-
For your men.

69
00:08:12.797 --> 00:08:14.227
We go now.

70
00:08:25.843 --> 00:08:27.240
Men!

71
00:08:31.211 --> 00:08:34.511
\h\hThis is more than I paid
to bring the damn cargo here.

72
00:08:34.511 --> 00:08:36.414
What did he spit at the end?

73
00:08:36.414 --> 00:08:37.987
\h\h\h"Good leave"
or "good riddance"?

74
00:08:37.987 --> 00:08:40.385
"Good luck."

75
00:08:48.063 --> 00:08:50.604
-Come on. pull!

76
00:08:50.604 --> 00:08:52.606

That’s where they used to hang

00:18:11.131 --> 00:18:12.792
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI know

Do you. now?

224
00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:15.828
Yeah.

225
00:18:15.828 --> 00:18:17.830
\hIt’s a place we pay women

226
00:18:19.172 --> 00:18:21.097
\h-Ah. I love kids!

227

00:18:25.343 --> 00:18:27.312
Close enough.

Well. Mr. Clemens.
\h\hwhat about you?

232
00:18:29.809 --> 00:18:31.943
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-Sir?
-Our charter has agreed

233
00:18:31.943 --> 00:18:33.615
to pay a sizable bonus

00:18:33.615 --> 00:18:36.255
\h\hfor timely arrival
of his cargo in London.

235
00:18:36.255 --> 00:18:37.751
You’re part of the crew.

236
00:18:37.751 --> 00:18:40.259
which means you earn
\ha crewman’s share.

237
00:18:40.259 --> 00:18:41.656
How do you plan spending it?

238
00:18:41.656 --> 00:18:45.759
A new petticoat. perhaps?

239
00:18:45.759 --> 00:18:47.530
\h\hWell. everything I desire
in this life. unfortunately.

240
00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:49.301
coin will be of no aid.

241
00:18:49.301 --> 00:18:52.095
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h
And what would that be. now?

242
00:18:52.095 --> 00:18:54.339
To understand this world.

243
00:18:54.339 --> 00:18:58.101
\h\h\h\h\hThe more of it I see.
the less any of it makes sense.

244
00:18:58.101 --> 00:19:01.610
The world cares little
for sense. Mr. Clemens.

245
00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:04.778
Perhaps it is not meant
\h\h\hto be understood

246
00:19:04.778 --> 00:19:07.748
but rather experienced
\h\h\h\h\hand accepted.

247
00:19:11.356 --> 00:19:13.017
Perhaps.

248
00:19:14.788 --> 00:19:16.790
\hBut I need to get
to the heart of it.

249
00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:19.298
And understand why

250
00:19:19.298 --> 00:19:24.270
the world has so much goodness
\h\h\h\h\hinside it and yet...

251
00:19:28.032 --> 00:19:30.903
\h\h(chuckles) Isn’t that
what all men desire. mm?

252
00:19:32.509 --> 00:19:34.412
Deep down.

253
00:19:36.315 --> 00:19:38.317
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hABRAMS:
Well. hell. he’s right.

254
00:19:38.317 --> 00:19:40.385
I’ll have his share. then.

255
00:19:42.486 --> 00:19:44.048
\h-

256
00:19:44.048 --> 00:19:45.390
What the devil is that?

257
00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:48.426
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hELIOT:

258
00:19:51.363 --> 00:19:53.464
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-Toby?

259
00:20:00.438 --> 00:20:02.198
What’s gotten into them?

260
00:20:02.198 --> 00:20:04.772
It’s probably just the weather.

261
00:20:04.772 --> 00:20:06.609
Hey. they can sense
\h\ha storm coming.

262
00:20:16.718 --> 00:20:19.259
Toby. give me a hand with this.

263
00:20:20.183 --> 00:20:22.559
That should put them to rest.

264
00:20:33.031 --> 00:20:35.407
What was that. Mr. Clemens?

265
00:20:35.407 --> 00:20:37.134
Fetch the captain. lad.

266
00:20:37.134 --> 00:20:39.312
Tell him something fell
\h\hin the cargo hold.

267
00:20:44.746 --> 00:20:46.847
\h\h\h\h-

268
00:22:37.826 --> 00:22:39.564
\h\h\h\h\h\h-Stay with me.

269
00:22:41.027 --> 00:22:42.930
Stay with me.

270
00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:45.471
Come on.

271
00:22:47.264 --> 00:22:50.168
-What in the seven hells?
\h\h-She was below deck.

272
00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:53.776
A stowaway.

273
00:22:53.776 --> 00:22:56.515
A stowaway who is going to die

274
00:22:56.515 --> 00:22:58.275
if we don’t administer
\hproper medical care.

275
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:05.051
You want to help her?

276
00:23:05.051 --> 00:23:09.352
Who knows what kind of diseased
\h\h\hrat infections she has...

277
00:23:09.352 --> 00:23:10.958
\h\h\h\h\h-Captain.
-What do you need?

278
00:23:10.958 --> 00:23:12.465
Her body’s infected.

279
00:23:12.465 --> 00:23:14.060
I need to attempt
\ha transfusion.

280
00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:16.062
-What are you babbling?
\h-A blood transfusion.

281
00:23:16.062 --> 00:23:18.966
\h\h\h\hShe needs blood
to fight the infection.

282
00:23:18.966 --> 00:23:20.869
\h\h\hWOJCHEK:
You’re joking.

283
00:23:20.869 --> 00:23:23.707
You are of aid to me or you are

284
00:23:23.707 --> 00:23:25.643
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hIn either case.
please make yourself apparent

285
00:23:25.643 --> 00:23:27.304

00:24:09.016 --> 00:24:11.018
\h\h\h-

287
00:24:23.261 --> 00:24:26.165
\hCLEMENS: She’ll make it the
night. but I need to continue

288
00:24:26.165 --> 00:24:30.004
\h\hwith the transfusions until
she has no more infected blood.

289
00:24:31.302 --> 00:24:33.612
We’ve done all we can.

290
00:24:33.612 --> 00:24:35.680
Then maybe she’ll
\hwake up in time to see us

291
00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:38.111
toss her to the waves.

292
00:24:38.111 --> 00:24:41.950
\h\h\h\hWe let Poseidon deal
with stowaways-- always have.

293
00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:45.448
I didn’t save this girl’s life
\h\h\honly to watch you end it.

294
00:24:45.448 --> 00:24:47.384
At least let us off
\hat the next port.

295
00:24:47.384 --> 00:24:49.023
"Us." is it?

296
00:24:49.023 --> 00:24:52.697
I see where your loyalty lies.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hMr. Clemens.

297
00:24:52.697 --> 00:24:55.799
We stop. then we forfeit

298
00:24:55.799 --> 00:24:58.230
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hAnd I ain’t

299
00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:00.298

Control your language.

302
00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:05.677
I would prefer not to have
\h\h\h\h\h\hmy final voyage

Demeter

304

306
00:25:15.148 --> 00:25:17.183
\hWe will repurpose

\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-Thank you. sir.

308
00:25:19.482 --> 00:25:22.892

-You’ll look after her for me.
\h\h\h\h\h\hwill you? -Mm-hmm.

All right. then. Go on.
\h\hThat’s a good lad.

00:26:16.814 --> 00:26:18.442
You’re making

\h\hBad omen. Hmm?

Bad luck.

\h\h\h\h\hdo they. Mr. Olgaren?

321
00:26:30.058 --> 00:26:32.423
They just need to get this boat

322
00:26:34.458 --> 00:26:37.494
\hI’m trying to help you. son.
Keep spouting words like that.

323
00:26:37.494 --> 00:26:39.166
Maybe she’ll make it
\h\hto London. but...

324
00:26:39.166 --> 00:26:40.805
\h\h\hbut I reckon
you’ll be swimming.

325
00:26:42.136 --> 00:26:44.644
Knock if you need me.

326
00:26:44.644 --> 00:26:46.646
-Saves the pipes.
\h\h\h\h\h\h-Mm.

327
00:26:46.646 --> 00:26:48.912
-Understand?
\h\h\h\h-Aye!

328
00:26:59.318 --> 00:27:01.958
Islands and rocks
everywhere here.

329
00:27:01.958 --> 00:27:04.257
So we’re in the Aegean. yes?

330
00:27:04.257 --> 00:27:06.490
It’s the Mediterranean at dawn.

331
00:27:07.458 --> 00:27:08.932
It’s good time. innit?

332
00:27:10.593 --> 00:27:13.233
Greece should be
to our starboard.

333
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:59.081
Mr. Olgaren?

334
00:28:18.364 --> 00:28:19.596
Mr. Olgaren?

335
00:28:52.134 --> 00:28:53.872
Olgaren?

336
00:29:06.214 --> 00:29:09.822
Jesus Christ!

337
00:29:09.822 --> 00:29:11.615
Did you see it?

338
00:29:11.615 --> 00:29:13.155
Did no one pass by?

339
00:29:13.155 --> 00:29:15.894
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hSee what?
There’s no one on deck but us.

340
00:29:16.829 --> 00:29:19.491
There is something out there.

341
00:29:22.967 --> 00:29:24.364
Someone.

342
00:30:35.875 --> 00:30:37.536
What the...

343
00:30:43.806 --> 00:30:46.215
Oh. God. Huck.

344
00:31:12.406 --> 00:31:14.243
All the livestock?

345
00:31:18.577 --> 00:31:23.186
Any man with knowledge
\h\hof this heinous act

346
00:31:23.186 --> 00:31:27.190
\hneeds to step forward now or
find themselves in irons later.

347
00:31:29.192 --> 00:31:30.721
The girl...

348
00:31:30.721 --> 00:31:32.591
\h\h\h\h\h\hWas in no shape
to do anything of the sort.

349
00:31:32.591 --> 00:31:35.429
\hand Mr. Wojchek can attest to
that. even if he’d rather not.

350
00:31:36.364 --> 00:31:37.937
Aye.

351
00:31:37.937 --> 00:31:39.939
He’s right on this.

352
00:31:39.939 --> 00:31:42.436
She didn’t need to.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hWe all know.

353
00:31:42.436 --> 00:31:45.802
Bad luck. woman on board.

354
00:31:45.802 --> 00:31:48.409
Makes skies turn.
\hanimals go mad.

355
00:31:48.409 --> 00:31:49.949
The dog was ripped into.

356
00:31:49.949 --> 00:31:53.216
Perhaps he went rabid
\h\hand was gored by

357
00:31:53.216 --> 00:31:55.119
one of the larger livestock
\h\h\h\has it attacked it.

358
00:31:55.119 --> 00:31:57.583
You think Huck did this?

359
00:31:57.583 --> 00:31:59.222
Ripped apart the animals?

360
00:31:59.222 --> 00:32:01.917
No. He’s a good dog.

361
00:32:01.917 --> 00:32:03.490
\h\h\h\h\hWOJCHEK:
You heard the man.

362
00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:05.657
Rabies. Bad luck is all.

363
00:32:05.657 --> 00:32:08.066
Push on through as we always do.

364
00:32:08.066 --> 00:32:13.170
\h\h\hIf this is an outbreak.
then we’ll need to make port.

365
00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:15.469
\h\h\h-Captain... -No. No. -No.
we won’t make our bonus. then.

366
00:32:15.469 --> 00:32:17.306
\hWhat are you talking about?
Then we lose the bonus wage.

367
00:32:17.306 --> 00:32:18.802
We can’t make port. No.

368
00:32:18.802 --> 00:32:22.245
\h\hELIOT: Mr. Clemens.
a malady of this sort.

369
00:32:22.245 --> 00:32:24.412
could a human catch it?

370
00:32:31.518 --> 00:32:33.850
No.

371
00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:37.689
\hRabies. it-it can’t pass to
a human without it being bit.

372
00:32:41.297 --> 00:32:43.332
Dispose of the meat.

373
00:32:44.267 --> 00:32:46.137
Immediately.

374
00:32:46.137 --> 00:32:48.139
I guess we say
\h\h\hthe Lord’s Prayer

375
00:32:48.139 --> 00:32:50.603
\hover cabbage and potatoes
for the rest of our voyage.

376
00:32:53.507 --> 00:32:55.971
Have you all been struck dumb?

377
00:32:55.971 --> 00:33:01.284
It’s not rabies that opened up
\h\h\h\h\hthe livestock cages.

378
00:33:01.284 --> 00:33:03.286
\h\h\hAnd there is only
two people on this boat

379
00:33:03.286 --> 00:33:05.288
I have not sailed with fore now:

380
00:33:05.288 --> 00:33:07.950
in the toolshed

381
00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:11.723
\h\hand this darky savage
pretending to be doctor.

382
00:33:11.723 --> 00:33:14.297
\h\h-Mm?

383
00:33:15.463 --> 00:33:17.234
Say it again.

384
00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:27.937
\h\h\h\hOLGAREN:
No man did this.

385
00:33:31.644 --> 00:33:33.877
Evil is on board.

386
00:33:33.877 --> 00:33:35.318
Powerful evil.

387
00:34:06.448 --> 00:34:09.814
DRACULA
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hAnna.

388
00:34:11.189 --> 00:34:13.686
\h-
-That bloody reeks.

389
00:34:24.466 --> 00:34:26.171
\h\hToby?

390
00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.809
Toby?

391
00:34:39.646 --> 00:34:40.878
Hey.

392
00:34:44.156 --> 00:34:46.389
Huck was a good dog. son.

393
00:34:48.721 --> 00:34:49.920
I’m sorry.

394
00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:53.891
It wasn’t just Huckleberry.

395
00:34:53.891 --> 00:34:55.794
I promised the captain I--

396
00:34:55.794 --> 00:34:59.171
\h\h\hIt was my job
to look after them.

397
00:34:59.171 --> 00:35:00.931
The animals. I mean.

398
00:35:00.931 --> 00:35:03.835
I-I promised the captain.

399
00:35:06.145 --> 00:35:07.476
Hmm.

400
00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:13.944
Toby...

401
00:35:13.944 --> 00:35:18.047
sometimes things go wrong.
no matter what we promise.

402
00:35:19.851 --> 00:35:21.589
All right?

403
00:35:21.589 --> 00:35:25.428
There are things in this world
\h\h\h\hthat we can’t control.

404
00:35:25.428 --> 00:35:28.926
but we do our best. Hmm?

405
00:35:28.926 --> 00:35:30.433
Yeah.

406
00:35:30.433 --> 00:35:32.237
Thanks. Mr. Clemens.

407
00:35:34.635 --> 00:35:36.505
Go on.

408
00:35:59.198 --> 00:36:01.299
\h\h-

409
00:36:18.844 --> 00:36:20.351
The skies are angry.

410
00:36:20.351 --> 00:36:22.144
\h\h\hCLEMENS: The skies
feel nothing. my friend.

411
00:36:22.144 --> 00:36:24.883
It’s precipitation
\hand air pressure.

412
00:36:24.883 --> 00:36:27.226
\h\h\h\h\h\has knowable as
the workings of this ship.

413
00:36:27.226 --> 00:36:29.987
I saw something last night.

414
00:36:29.987 --> 00:36:32.187
There is something unnatural
\h\h\h\h\h\hon board with us.

415
00:36:32.187 --> 00:36:34.893
\h\hI’m afraid I don’t believe
in superstitions. Mr. Olgaren.

416
00:36:34.893 --> 00:36:38.897
I believe in science
\h\h\hand in nature.

417
00:36:38.897 --> 00:36:40.503
And in Saint Nicholas.

418
00:36:40.503 --> 00:36:41.735
\hsince Joseph wouldn’t
give me food otherwise.

419
00:36:41.735 --> 00:36:43.198
Keep your science.

420
00:36:43.198 --> 00:36:45.541
\h\h\h\hI saw your face
in the dark last night.

421
00:36:45.541 --> 00:36:47.609
Your eyes.

422
00:36:48.676 --> 00:36:52.317
You saw it. same as I.

423
00:37:01.018 --> 00:37:03.053
\h\h\hELIOT:
16th of July.

424
00:37:03.053 --> 00:37:07.464
Rough weather last three days
and all hands busy with sails.

425
00:37:08.597 --> 00:37:10.467
Our ship’s doctor continues

426
00:37:10.467 --> 00:37:13.404
\h\h\h\hto administer regular
transfusions to our stowaway.

427
00:37:13.404 --> 00:37:17.100
yet her condition
remains unchanged.

428
00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.938
Food is running sparse.

429
00:37:19.938 --> 00:37:22.204
men downcast.

430
00:37:22.204 --> 00:37:24.712
and now past Cape Matapan.

431
00:37:24.712 --> 00:37:27.352
we’ve more than two weeks
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hto travel.

432
00:37:30.916 --> 00:37:32.214
\h\h\h\h\h\hTOBY:
Her name is Anna.

433
00:37:32.214 --> 00:37:34.326
\h\h\h\h\hCLEMENS:
She told you that?

434
00:37:34.326 --> 00:37:35.822
Has she been awake?

435
00:37:35.822 --> 00:37:38.088
Mr. Olgaren taught me
\h\h\h\hsome Romani.

436
00:37:38.088 --> 00:37:40.563
She speaks some English
\h\h\h\hsometimes. too.

437
00:37:43.962 --> 00:37:46.998
She didn’t say this one
\h\h\h\hso much. but...

438
00:37:46.998 --> 00:37:49.407
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI don’t think
she’s having very nice dreams.

439
00:37:50.639 --> 00:37:54.478
She repeats a word
\h\hover and over.

440
00:37:55.842 --> 00:37:57.514
"Feed."

441
00:38:10.989 --> 00:38:12.925
\h\h\hJOSEPH:
Can’t sleep?

442
00:38:14.762 --> 00:38:16.698
You noticed it. too. then.

443
00:38:20.262 --> 00:38:23.199
The rats.

444
00:38:23.199 --> 00:38:24.871
Still quiet.

445
00:38:24.871 --> 00:38:26.939
I was checking the larder.
\h\h\h\h\hThey’re all gone.

446
00:38:26.939 --> 00:38:30.272
Gone? What do you mean gone?

447
00:38:30.272 --> 00:38:32.175
I mean what I say. Gone.

448
00:38:32.175 --> 00:38:35.387
Always a dozen or so
\h\hin the woodwork.

449
00:38:35.387 --> 00:38:38.181
screeching. scrabbling.

450
00:38:38.181 --> 00:38:40.117
Well. if... if Huck went rabid.

451
00:38:40.117 --> 00:38:42.460
perhaps. before the livestock.
\h\h\h\h\hhe drove them off...

452
00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:46.398
You could burn this ship
to the keel. Mr. Clemens.

453
00:38:46.398 --> 00:38:49.764
\h\hand the rats would
just nest in the ashes.

454
00:38:54.406 --> 00:38:56.738
Something drove them off.

455
00:39:03.646 --> 00:39:06.385
A boat without rats.

456
00:39:06.385 --> 00:39:09.080
such a thing is against nature.

457
00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:33.236
Abrams?

458
00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:38.340
Playing some kind
\hof fool’s joke.

459
00:39:42.014 --> 00:39:44.346
Idiots playing games. huh?

460
00:39:46.249 --> 00:39:47.492
Abrams?

461
00:41:10.509 --> 00:41:13.974
\h\hWhere the hell
did you come from?

462
00:42:32.283 --> 00:42:34.153
Petrofsky?

463
00:43:06.152 --> 00:43:08.286
\h\h\h-

464
00:43:12.323 --> 00:43:15.491
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hELIOT:
The knife was found here?

465
00:43:15.491 --> 00:43:17.460
And the wheel was tied off?

466
00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:19.594
Petrofsky must have been drunk.

467
00:43:19.594 --> 00:43:22.740
\h\h\h\h\hSlipped on the deck
and (scoffs) fell overboard.

468
00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:24.808
Right after he bled
all over the deck?

469
00:43:26.106 --> 00:43:28.911
And what were you doing up
in the middle of the night?

470
00:43:28.911 --> 00:43:31.408
You had his knife in your hand
\h\h\h\h\h\hwhen we found you.

471
00:43:31.408 --> 00:43:33.949
Of course. I-I killed him.

472
00:43:33.949 --> 00:43:35.610
And somehow managed
\h\hto keep myself

473
00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:37.612
\h\h\h\hfree of all the blood
you see staining the boards.

474
00:43:37.612 --> 00:43:39.614
then I rang the signal bell
\h\h\h\h\hto report myself.

475
00:43:39.614 --> 00:43:41.154
It’s quite brilliant.
\hinnit. Mr. Wojchek?

476
00:43:41.154 --> 00:43:42.254
Open-and-shut case.

477
00:43:54.838 --> 00:43:58.138
Captain. the dog’s body.
\h\h\h\h\hI examined it.

478
00:43:58.138 --> 00:44:01.537
It wasn’t killed in the larder
\h\h\h\hlike the other animals.

479
00:44:01.537 --> 00:44:05.178
It had bite marks on its neck.
\h\h\h\h\hAll the animals did.

480
00:44:06.817 --> 00:44:08.819
What exactly are you
\hsuggesting. Mr. Clemens?

481
00:44:08.819 --> 00:44:10.953
\h\h\h\h\hCLEMENS:
I don’t know. sir.

482
00:44:10.953 --> 00:44:13.021
\h\h\hbut their arteries were
ripped open. and then they...

483
00:44:13.021 --> 00:44:14.187
He’s here.

484
00:44:16.354 --> 00:44:18.059
He is here.

485
00:44:18.059 --> 00:44:20.325
We have to get off this boat.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNow!

00:44:20.325 --> 00:44:22.459
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hAll of us!

-Now! He will kill us all!
\h\h-Please! Anna. please!

489
00:44:26.529 --> 00:44:28.003
-Anna. please! Please!
\h\h\h\h\h-Kill us all!

490
00:44:28.003 --> 00:44:30.368
-Get off the boat.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-

491
00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:39.344
Captain will say a few words
\h\h\h\h\hfrom the good book.

492
00:44:39.344 --> 00:44:41.346
and we’ll get on with things.

493
00:44:41.346 --> 00:44:43.051
There’s not enough liquor
on board to get Petrofsky

494
00:44:43.051 --> 00:44:44.855
-drunk enough to fall off...
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-Mr. Abrams.

495
00:44:44.855 --> 00:44:46.384
\hAre we not gonna listen to
the lass and what she just...

496
00:44:46.384 --> 00:44:48.991
I’ll spend no more time
\h\hdiscussing anything

497
00:44:48.991 --> 00:44:53.028
but the state of this boat
\h\h\h\h\hand the weather.

498
00:44:53.028 --> 00:44:56.130
Understood. Mr. Abrams?
\h\h\h\h\hGet to work.

499
00:45:02.004 --> 00:45:03.698
\h\h\hELIOT:
18th of July.

500
00:45:03.698 --> 00:45:05.370
Men reported in the morning

501
00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:08.241
\hthat one of the crew.
Petrofsky. was missing.

502
00:45:08.241 --> 00:45:11.244
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI had the men do
a thorough search of the ship.

503
00:45:11.244 --> 00:45:13.180
This after Olgaren confided

504
00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:16.953
that he had seen something
\h\hstrange nights before.

505
00:45:26.127 --> 00:45:27.766
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hCLEMENS:
These blood transfusions

506
00:45:27.766 --> 00:45:30.494
should keep your infection
\h\h\h\h\h\hunder control.

507
00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:37.138
So. what were you trying
\h\hto tell us out there?

508
00:45:40.075 --> 00:45:43.276
He is here on the ship.

509
00:45:43.276 --> 00:45:45.047
He has been all along.

510
00:45:46.477 --> 00:45:48.479
He?

511
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:55.651
Okay.

512
00:45:55.651 --> 00:45:58.929
\h\h\h\hI can’t help you
if you don’t speak to me

513
00:45:58.929 --> 00:46:02.064
\hand tell me what happened.
why we found you below deck.

514
00:46:06.838 --> 00:46:11.304
It is spoken in my village
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hof an evil

515
00:46:11.304 --> 00:46:14.241
\h\h\h\h\h\hthat lives
in the mountains above.

516
00:46:14.241 --> 00:46:18.773
A castle older than any of us.

517
00:46:18.773 --> 00:46:21.644
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-Evil?
-An evil that appears as a man

518
00:46:21.644 --> 00:46:23.921
when it wants to hide
\h\hits true nature.

519
00:46:23.921 --> 00:46:27.518
\h\h\hAnd at night. he feeds
on the blood of the innocent.

520
00:46:27.518 --> 00:46:31.027
\hI have lived in the shadow
of that castle my whole life.

521
00:46:32.094 --> 00:46:35.460
I knew that the elders. they...

522
00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:40.168
\h\h\h\h\hthey made bargains
for the safety of our people.

523
00:46:40.168 --> 00:46:41.939
You were given to this man?

524
00:46:41.939 --> 00:46:44.634
-It is not a man.
-Then an animal?

525
00:46:44.634 --> 00:46:47.439
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNo. it is not
some mindless animal either.

526
00:46:47.439 --> 00:46:48.946
Do not make that mistake.

527
00:46:50.442 --> 00:46:53.544
We call him Dracula.

528
00:46:53.544 --> 00:46:56.679
\h\h\h\h\hAnd you-you believe
that he brought you on board?

529
00:47:00.221 --> 00:47:01.585
Why?

530
00:47:13.135 --> 00:47:16.072
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hANNA:
He brought me here to feed.

531
00:47:16.072 --> 00:47:17.733
Dear God.

532
00:47:20.835 --> 00:47:23.409
He is here. Mr. Clemens.

533
00:47:25.048 --> 00:47:29.349
The thing that wears
\hthe skin of a man.

534
00:47:29.349 --> 00:47:31.582
\h\h\hIn the night.
it drinks our blood.

535
00:47:31.582 --> 00:47:34.024
and he is on this ship.

536
00:47:34.024 --> 00:47:36.290
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hWhich means
that we will never leave it.

537
00:47:47.598 --> 00:47:49.501
The woman.

538
00:47:49.501 --> 00:47:52.339
she seems harmless. but...

539
00:47:52.339 --> 00:47:55.540
ever since she came on board.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI wonder if...

540
00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:58.840
\hif we would have been better
just to let the ocean have her.

541
00:48:01.678 --> 00:48:03.680
But then I think about
\h\h\h\h\hmy daughter.

542
00:48:06.386 --> 00:48:09.224
She’s around her age and...

543
00:48:09.224 --> 00:48:11.556
smart and-and pretty.

544
00:48:26.109 --> 00:48:27.605
\h-

545
00:49:41.217 --> 00:49:42.779
Olgaren?

546
00:49:51.194 --> 00:49:52.921
Olgaren?

547
00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:14.052
\h\h\hWhat’s wrong?
I heard your knock.

548
00:50:14.052 --> 00:50:15.911
My knock?

549
00:50:50.187 --> 00:50:52.750
\h\h\h-

550
00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:04.597
Please. no!

551
00:51:15.641 --> 00:51:19.579

\h\h\h\h\hWOJCHEK:

553
00:51:48.938 --> 00:51:50.247

555
00:52:03.788 --> 00:52:06.087
Where the devil is Larsen?!

556
00:52:09.332 --> 00:52:12.093
-Larsen! Larsen!
-Larsen! Larsen!

557
00:52:12.093 --> 00:52:14.601
-Olgaren!
-Larsen!

558
00:52:19.034 --> 00:52:21.069

-That’s it.
\h\h\h-

562
00:53:04.486 --> 00:53:06.587
Olgaren. where’s Larsen?

563
00:53:06.587 --> 00:53:09.524
Olgaren. Hey.

564
00:53:09.524 --> 00:53:10.822
\h\hCLEMENS:
There he is.

565
00:53:10.822 --> 00:53:12.725
\h\h\h\h-

00:53:12.725 --> 00:53:13.726

00:53:17.268 --> 00:53:19.864
\h\h\hELIOT:
24th of July.

568
00:53:19.864 --> 00:53:23.571
There seems some doom
\h\h\h\hover the ship.

569
00:53:23.571 --> 00:53:26.673
\h\h\halready a hand short
entering the Bay of Biscay

570
00:53:26.673 --> 00:53:28.774
with wild weather ahead.

571
00:53:28.774 --> 00:53:34.450
\hAnd last night. a second man
lost and another man injured.

572
00:53:34.450 --> 00:53:37.112
A strange injury.

573
00:53:37.112 --> 00:53:40.423
Men all in a panic of fear.

574
00:53:41.952 --> 00:53:44.020
We are 18 days at sea.

575
00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:46.990
The closest port is England.

576
00:53:47.958 --> 00:53:51.962
We must put our trust in God
\h\h\h\h\h\hand go forward.

577
00:53:59.277 --> 00:54:00.938
\h\h\h\hCLEMENS:
He’s cold as ice.

578
00:54:00.938 --> 00:54:04.579
He makes noises and he moves.
\h\hbut his eyes won’t open.

579
00:54:04.579 --> 00:54:07.076
Like he’s unable to wake
\h\h\h\hfrom some dream.

580
00:54:07.076 --> 00:54:08.715
But what happened to his neck?

581
00:54:08.715 --> 00:54:10.112
And what was he doing
\h\h\hin the rigging?

582
00:54:10.112 --> 00:54:12.554
Anything could have happened.

583
00:54:12.554 --> 00:54:16.624
\h\h\hPerhaps some rigging
wrapped around his throat.

584
00:54:16.624 --> 00:54:18.252
No. No. no. no.

585
00:54:18.252 --> 00:54:20.056
This looks like a bite.

586
00:54:20.056 --> 00:54:22.630
It looks like the same bites
\h\h\hwe saw in the animals.

587
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:24.467
the same bites that ravaged the
\hgirl in the carpenter’s shed.

I...

591
00:54:34.774 --> 00:54:36.611
...do not.

592
00:54:36.611 --> 00:54:38.976
\h\h\h\h\h\h-Good.
-But something did.

593
00:54:40.109 --> 00:54:42.485
And that is real and on board.

594
00:54:42.485 --> 00:54:45.180
\h\h\h\hwhether we choose

From now on.

00:54:53.628 --> 00:54:57.764
\h\h\h\hI want two men

Search the ship. Mr. Wojchek.

599
00:55:04.606 --> 00:55:07.378
Not just the hold.

600
00:55:07.378 --> 00:55:08.643
Everywhere.

601
00:55:55.888 --> 00:55:57.758
All right. Toby.

602
00:55:59.155 --> 00:56:01.795
You have quite the task.

603
00:56:06.162 --> 00:56:08.538
A captain...

604
00:56:08.538 --> 00:56:10.804
is only as good as his spyglass.

605
00:56:12.168 --> 00:56:14.577
\h\h\h\hCan I trust you
to shine it up for me?

606
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:17.547
If it’s too much to...

607
00:56:17.547 --> 00:56:19.076
No.

608
00:56:20.616 --> 00:56:23.047
I mean. no. sir.

609
00:56:23.047 --> 00:56:25.852

01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:45.120
Move!

657
01:04:48.189 --> 01:04:50.851
\h\h\h-Toby!
Toby!

658
01:04:55.262 --> 01:04:56.362
Toby!

659
01:04:58.463 --> 01:04:59.827
Toby!

660
01:05:06.867 --> 01:05:08.704
\hToby?

661
01:05:08.704 --> 01:05:11.542
Toby. Toby.

662
01:05:11.542 --> 01:05:13.049
Oh. my God.

663
01:05:47.281 --> 01:05:49.547
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hELIOT:
You will be fine. my boy.

664
01:05:52.451 --> 01:05:54.948
Everything will be fine.

665
01:05:54.948 --> 01:05:57.720
\h\h\h\h\hMr. Clemens
will take care of us.

666
01:06:04.958 --> 01:06:06.432
\h\hELIOT:
August 1st.

667
01:06:06.432 --> 01:06:09.699
\h\hWe must be past
the Strait of Dover.

668
01:06:09.699 --> 01:06:12.702
Still five days to London.

669
01:06:12.702 --> 01:06:16.937
God seems to have deserted us.

670
01:06:16.937 --> 01:06:20.908
\hand we are drifting
to some terrible doom.

671
01:06:22.712 --> 01:06:24.681
Lord help us.

672
01:06:27.486 --> 01:06:29.554
He’s mad.

673
01:06:29.554 --> 01:06:31.160
As if possessed.

674
01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:33.162
\h\h-JOSEPH: Possessed by
that beast? -Oh. no. no.

675
01:06:33.162 --> 01:06:35.461
Not in the way you mean.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hat least.

676
01:06:35.461 --> 01:06:38.398
It’s like a poison or...

677
01:06:38.398 --> 01:06:39.795
an infection.

678
01:06:39.795 --> 01:06:42.336
\hWOJCHEK:
Infection?

679
01:06:42.336 --> 01:06:44.965
Not like any I’ve ever seen.

680
01:06:48.210 --> 01:06:50.839
I can feel it.

681
01:06:50.839 --> 01:06:52.511
Olgaren?

682
01:06:52.511 --> 01:06:53.941
Can you hear me?

683
01:06:54.876 --> 01:06:58.055
I can hear everything.

684
01:07:00.552 --> 01:07:03.357
The sea.

685
01:07:03.357 --> 01:07:05.425
The wind.

686
01:07:05.425 --> 01:07:07.790
The blood pumping in your veins.

687
01:07:13.202 --> 01:07:14.929
It burns.

688
01:07:16.865 --> 01:07:20.176
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hBurn?
Maybe he needs some water.

689
01:07:21.936 --> 01:07:24.444
It burns.

690
01:07:25.379 --> 01:07:27.216
Olgaren?

691
01:07:27.216 --> 01:07:28.481
\hBurns.

692
01:07:33.222 --> 01:07:36.357
It burns! It burns!

693
01:07:38.359 --> 01:07:40.592
It burns!

694
01:07:40.592 --> 01:07:42.594
It burns!

695
01:08:36.109 --> 01:08:37.847
Oh. for God’s sake.

696
01:08:37.847 --> 01:08:40.718
Will someone say something?

697
01:08:43.457 --> 01:08:46.295
What the hell happened to him?

698
01:08:46.295 --> 01:08:48.627
I warned you.

699
01:08:48.627 --> 01:08:52.125
I warned all you. didn’t I?

700
01:08:52.125 --> 01:08:55.029
\h\h\h\hIt is a punishment
brought down for our sins.

701
01:08:55.029 --> 01:08:56.437
Petrofsky. a criminal.

702
01:08:56.437 --> 01:08:58.934
Olgaren. gypsy heathen.

703
01:08:58.934 --> 01:09:00.100
A whoremonger. a lecher.

704
01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:01.937
And from Gomorrah herself...

705
01:09:01.937 --> 01:09:05.380
Oh. will you shut the hell up.
\h\h\h\h\h\hyou bleedin’ idiot!

706
01:09:09.549 --> 01:09:14.224
Abrams. take the morning watch.

707
01:09:14.224 --> 01:09:16.193
\h\h\hAnd. Joseph. you are
to relieve him when he’s...

708
01:09:16.193 --> 01:09:19.229
That child will be the next
\h\hto rise up from death.

709
01:09:19.229 --> 01:09:23.024
\hSatan’s black blood pumping
corruption through his veins.

710
01:09:23.024 --> 01:09:25.994
God’s anger has come upon
this vessel like Jonah...

711
01:09:25.994 --> 01:09:27.633
Just shut it up!

712
01:09:27.633 --> 01:09:30.570
See to the supplies.

713
01:09:35.641 --> 01:09:37.643
Whatever was in Olgaren...

714
01:09:40.008 --> 01:09:42.252
...it’s fair to assume
\h\h\hit is in the boy.

715
01:09:42.252 --> 01:09:44.012
He has all the same symptoms.

716
01:09:44.012 --> 01:09:46.553
But your blood transfusions
\h\h\h\h\h\hsaved the girl.

717
01:09:46.553 --> 01:09:48.423
-Not Toby.
\h-

718
01:09:48.423 --> 01:09:51.360
He’s smaller. He’s weaker.

719
01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:54.891
\h\h\h\h\hThe wound was worse.
and the blood loss is greater.

720
01:09:54.891 --> 01:09:56.926
Just...

721
01:09:56.926 --> 01:09:59.269
I don’t know. I think. uh...

722
01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:07.068
\h\h\h\h\hI think we might
have to start discussing...

723
01:10:14.350 --> 01:10:15.648
\hGo on.

724
01:10:17.177 --> 01:10:20.587
Look him in the eye
\h\hwhen you do it.

725
01:10:20.587 --> 01:10:23.854
That’s not what I meant.
That is not what I meant.

726
01:10:23.854 --> 01:10:26.120
It has to be hiding here.
\h\h\hIf we can find it.

727
01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:28.397
\h\hI think we might be able to
figure out a way to save him...

728
01:10:28.397 --> 01:10:31.125
\h\h\hAre you sure the boy is
the one that’s on your mind?

729
01:10:31.125 --> 01:10:33.061
Get to your bunk.

730
01:10:33.061 --> 01:10:36.031
\hWe’re running out of men
for the watch at this rate.

731
01:11:01.331 --> 01:11:02.860
Anna.

732
01:11:10.131 --> 01:11:12.067
\hYou’re going to open
the crates. aren’t you?

733
01:11:12.067 --> 01:11:13.475
Yes.

734
01:11:13.475 --> 01:11:15.939
Go back to the shed
and bolt the door.

735
01:11:15.939 --> 01:11:18.414
\h\h\h\h\h\hWe are all trapped
on the same ship. Mr. Clemens.

736
01:11:18.414 --> 01:11:21.582
\hAre you forgetting it needs
to feed because you saved me?

737
01:11:21.582 --> 01:11:23.518
I’m coming with you.

738
01:11:23.518 --> 01:11:26.950
This thing has killed
\h\h\hmost the crew.

739
01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:30.085
Then imagine what it will do
\hif we let it get to London.

740
01:11:32.659 --> 01:11:34.254
Let’s go.

741
01:11:38.126 --> 01:11:42.537
If we do find your devil.
\h\hwill bullets kill it?

742
01:11:44.605 --> 01:11:47.674
He has controlled my village
\h\h\h\h\h\hfor generations.

743
01:11:47.674 --> 01:11:50.545
\h\h\h\hDo you think I have
any notion how to kill him?

744
01:11:53.713 --> 01:11:55.550
I never liked guns.

745
01:11:55.550 --> 01:11:57.618
I want you to have...

746
01:12:08.057 --> 01:12:10.367
Let’s see. Sixth of July.

747
01:12:10.367 --> 01:12:13.326
\h\hPrivate cargo consigned
for Carfax Abbey in London.

748
01:12:13.326 --> 01:12:16.065
Doesn’t say the owner.

749
01:12:40.925 --> 01:12:43.433
\h\hHe told Jonah.
and he was spared.

750
01:12:44.929 --> 01:12:46.865
He was spared.

751
01:12:46.865 --> 01:12:50.836
"I cried out to the Lord
because of my affliction.

752
01:12:50.836 --> 01:12:52.167

\h\h\h\h-CLEMENS: Why London?
Because in my country.

759
01:13:13.793 --> 01:13:15.256
there is no one left
\h\h\h\h\hto feed on.

760
01:13:41.315 --> 01:13:43.460
Let’s start with this one.

761
01:14:13.919 --> 01:14:15.118
Dirt.

762
01:14:15.118 --> 01:14:17.417
It’s nothing but dirt.

763
01:14:32.674 --> 01:14:35.072
Nothing.

764

Look.

766
01:16:08.297 --> 01:16:10.365
\h\h\h\h\hWe have found
where the devil sleeps.

No. There’s nothing here.

We’re a doomed crew.

On a doomed ship.

We no longer plot our course.

...take this sweet boy.

...never be scared.

Captain Eliot. the boy
\h\hhas no breath in his body.

822
01:22:28.281 --> 01:22:30.844
You can’t think your way

823
01:22:32.648 --> 01:22:34.419
\h\h\h\h\hI was one of

\h\h\hwith medical degree.

825
01:22:36.025 --> 01:22:37.323
Have I told you that?

826
01:22:37.323 --> 01:22:38.852
Well. that’s very nice
\h\h\h\h\h\hfor you...

827
01:22:38.852 --> 01:22:40.689
I applied to all the best
hospitals in the country.

828
01:22:40.689 --> 01:22:43.329
Immediately. I was told there
were no positions available.

829
01:22:43.329 --> 01:22:47.102
I fought tooth and nail
\h\h\hfor my education.

830
01:22:47.102 --> 01:22:49.797
\h\h\h\h\hand yet no one
would let me practice it.

831
01:22:49.797 --> 01:22:52.635
Finally. I was offered
\h\ha position by post.

832
01:22:52.635 --> 01:22:56.639
Royal physician to King Carol
\h\h\h\hthe First of Romania.

833
01:22:56.639 --> 01:22:59.378
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hMy name.
it reached them somehow.

834
01:23:00.643 --> 01:23:03.217
\h\hBut the color of my skin.
it would later seem. had not.

835
01:23:11.555 --> 01:23:15.460
Captain Eliot once asked me
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hover dinner

836
01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:17.660
what I most desired.

837
01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:20.597
\h\h\hI told him I wanted
the world to make sense.

838
01:23:22.995 --> 01:23:27.901
\h\h\h\h\hI need this world
to make sense. Mr. Wojchek.

839
01:23:29.804 --> 01:23:32.246
This beast--

840
01:23:32.246 --> 01:23:36.514
and mark my words.
\h\hit is a beast--

841
01:23:36.514 --> 01:23:38.417
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hdeep down.
I need it to make sense. too.

842
01:23:38.417 --> 01:23:40.089
I need to know why

843
01:23:40.089 --> 01:23:42.223
\h\h\h\h\hit is the way it is
and why it does what it does.

844
01:23:42.223 --> 01:23:43.851
And then I will remind
\h\hthe beast that it.

845
01:23:43.851 --> 01:23:46.887
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hlike the world.
has absolutely no hold over me.

846
01:23:46.887 --> 01:23:48.757
And then?

847
01:23:49.692 --> 01:23:52.068
And then I want to kill
\h\h\hthe cursed thing.

848
01:23:55.104 --> 01:23:57.700
If we barricade this cabin.

849
01:23:57.700 --> 01:24:00.835
we are a day from London
\h\h\h\h\hwith this wind.

850
01:24:00.835 --> 01:24:03.871
Can’t set more sail.
\h\hcrew what it is.

851
01:24:03.871 --> 01:24:05.840
\hCLEMENS: What. you want us to
wait around. eyes in the dark.

852
01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:07.380
served up and ready for dinner?

853
01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:09.349
\h\h\h\h\h\hWOJCHEK: It ran
from our guns in the night.

854
01:24:09.349 --> 01:24:10.449
\h\h\hIt won’t risk
an outright attack.

855
01:24:10.449 --> 01:24:12.385
Running?
\h\h\h-It’s...

856
01:24:12.385 --> 01:24:14.585
It was not running.

857
01:24:16.015 --> 01:24:17.324
It was rationing.

858
01:24:18.589 --> 01:24:20.492
Rationing?

859
01:24:27.059 --> 01:24:29.303
One a night.

860
01:24:29.303 --> 01:24:32.801
\h\hOnce we had hit open waters
and could no longer make port.

861
01:24:35.969 --> 01:24:38.576
It hid below deck.

862
01:24:38.576 --> 01:24:42.008
sustaining off Anna until then.

863
01:24:45.121 --> 01:24:47.486
But now it has us right where
\h\hit wants us. doesn’t it?

864
01:24:47.486 --> 01:24:50.016
\h\h\h\h\h\hLike he said.
London’s only a day away.

865
01:24:51.556 --> 01:24:53.789
It no longer needs us.

866
01:24:53.789 --> 01:24:57.628
\h\h\h\hSo we have to kill it
before it reaches the coast.

867
01:24:57.628 --> 01:24:59.333
\hABRAMS:
Kill it?

868
01:24:59.333 --> 01:25:01.896
We can’t even find it.

869
01:25:01.896 --> 01:25:04.272
No. we can’t.

870
01:25:04.272 --> 01:25:06.505
It is why we’re to set a trap.

871
01:25:06.505 --> 01:25:08.474
We must sink the ship.

872
01:25:08.474 --> 01:25:10.443
With him on it.

873
01:25:10.443 --> 01:25:11.840
Demeter?

874
01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:13.776
Have you gone mad?!

875
01:25:13.776 --> 01:25:15.613
\h\hCLEMENS:
She’s right.

876
01:25:15.613 --> 01:25:17.615
\h\h\hWe set up an ambush and
leave it on the sinking ship.

877
01:25:17.615 --> 01:25:20.288
\h\h\hThen we can escape
on one of the lifeboats.

878
01:25:20.288 --> 01:25:22.917
\hIf the course is right. we
should be able to make shore.

879
01:25:22.917 --> 01:25:24.589
This is my home.

880
01:25:24.589 --> 01:25:29.022
And I won’t tear her apart
\h\hfor this fucking thing!

881
01:25:29.022 --> 01:25:30.496
I grew up on a boat.
\h\h\h\hMr. Wojchek.

882
01:25:30.496 --> 01:25:32.498
Just like this one.

883
01:25:32.498 --> 01:25:35.171
My father was a deckhand
\h\h\h\h\hhis whole life.

884
01:25:35.171 --> 01:25:37.437
He always told me that the...

885
01:25:37.437 --> 01:25:41.375
the ship. the living part.

886
01:25:41.375 --> 01:25:42.640
is the men on board.

887
01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:44.037
The crews.

888
01:25:44.037 --> 01:25:46.347
The stories.

889
01:25:46.347 --> 01:25:48.910
\h\hEverything else is
just timber and nails.

890
01:25:49.779 --> 01:25:51.286
No!

891
01:25:53.981 --> 01:25:55.389
This is my home.

892
01:25:57.985 --> 01:25:59.228
She’s mine.

893
01:26:06.466 --> 01:26:08.798
It’s going to be me.

894
01:26:09.733 --> 01:26:12.065
\h\h\h\h\h\hCLEMENS:
We barricade the hold.

895
01:26:12.065 --> 01:26:15.068
so that he only has
one way out on deck.

896
01:26:15.068 --> 01:26:18.808
\h\h\h\h\hAs night falls.
Anna will be at the helm.

897
01:26:18.808 --> 01:26:20.909
When it comes for her.

898
01:26:20.909 --> 01:26:24.143
we’ll have a clear shot
\hfrom the crow’s nest.

899
01:26:24.143 --> 01:26:25.848
We sink the ship

900
01:26:25.848 --> 01:26:28.422
and send the wounded beast
\h\h\h\hto a watery grave.

901
01:26:54.041 --> 01:26:55.746
\hELIOT:
21 July.

902
01:26:55.746 --> 01:26:57.253
Fourth August.

903
01:26:57.253 --> 01:26:59.618
\h\h\hIt dare not touch--
You got to get Toby home.

904
01:26:59.618 --> 01:27:00.718
1830...

905
01:27:00.718 --> 01:27:01.950
Captain.

906
01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:04.051
No. uh. people need to know.

907
01:27:04.051 --> 01:27:06.427
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hUh. logs.
There needs to be a record.

908
01:27:06.427 --> 01:27:07.956
is lost. sir.

909
01:27:07.956 --> 01:27:09.661
We’re abandoning ship.

910
01:27:11.597 --> 01:27:12.796
Abandoning ship?

911
01:27:12.796 --> 01:27:14.963
Aye. sir.

912
01:27:18.868 --> 01:27:22.707
Mr. Wojchek’s below deck making
\h\h\hpreparations as we speak.

913
01:27:23.939 --> 01:27:25.446
We’ll leave the beast
\h\h\ha sinking ship

914
01:27:25.446 --> 01:27:27.811
as a farewell gift.

915
01:27:31.947 --> 01:27:33.454
He comes to me.

916
01:27:35.456 --> 01:27:38.624
\hHe whispers to me
behind my own eyes.

917
01:27:41.825 --> 01:27:44.157
He can bring Toby back.

918
01:27:44.157 --> 01:27:45.961
\h\h\hHe took him away.
He can bring him back.

919
01:27:45.961 --> 01:27:47.666
Captain. come to your senses.

920
01:27:47.666 --> 01:27:49.129
You know that’s not possible.

921
01:27:49.129 --> 01:27:51.736
Toby...

922
01:27:51.736 --> 01:27:53.408
Toby.

923
01:27:53.408 --> 01:27:56.345
I just need to bring
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hto shore.

924
01:27:56.345 --> 01:27:58.413
I’m sorry. Mr. Clemens.

925
01:27:58.413 --> 01:28:00.613
-No! -ANNA: Captain.
\h-

926
01:28:00.613 --> 01:28:01.944
You have seen him as I have.

927
01:28:01.944 --> 01:28:03.550
You know deep down
\hthat is not all.

928
01:28:16.156 --> 01:28:19.335
When I dream. sometimes...

929
01:28:19.335 --> 01:28:20.930
I remember who I was.

930
01:28:20.930 --> 01:28:23.196
Before him.

931
01:28:23.196 --> 01:28:27.937
But most often. I think of
\h\hthe box he kept me in.

932
01:28:29.477 --> 01:28:33.877
How every time he came for me
\h\h\hand tore into my flesh.

933
01:28:33.877 --> 01:28:36.814
drank his fill.

934
01:28:36.814 --> 01:28:39.883
dirt would seep into
\h\hthe fresh wound.

935
01:28:39.883 --> 01:28:41.181
filling me up.

936
01:28:42.149 --> 01:28:44.184
Demeter.

937
01:28:44.184 --> 01:28:46.021
Picture Toby’s face.

938
01:28:46.956 --> 01:28:50.058
His smile. his laugh.

939
01:28:51.224 --> 01:28:53.226
And think of that dirt
\h\hfilling him up. too.

940
01:28:53.226 --> 01:28:56.537
\h\h\hbecause that’s
what the devil does.

941
01:28:56.537 --> 01:29:00.706
\h\h\h\hHe takes what is good
and what you love. and he...

942
01:29:00.706 --> 01:29:04.809
he uses it. and he twists it.
\hand he rots it from within.

943
01:29:06.877 --> 01:29:09.484
\h\hDo not let him do that
to the memory of your boy.

944
01:29:48.083 --> 01:29:49.953
I will...

945
01:29:51.020 --> 01:29:54.353
I will sail the ship
\h\h\h\h\hout to sea.

946
01:29:57.191 --> 01:29:59.292
And when she finally goes...

947
01:30:02.196 --> 01:30:06.706
\h...the monster will never be
able to reach the home I knew.

948
01:30:08.576 --> 01:30:09.808
That Toby knew.

949
01:30:09.808 --> 01:30:11.612
Captain.

950
01:30:11.612 --> 01:30:14.175
there’s no need for you
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hDemeter.

951
01:30:18.311 --> 01:30:20.786
Where would I go. Mr. Clemens?

952
01:30:43.435 --> 01:30:45.437
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hABRAMS:
Do you think this’ll work?

953
01:30:45.437 --> 01:30:47.208
It has to.

954
01:30:49.947 --> 01:30:52.114
There she is.
\h\h-

955
01:30:52.114 --> 01:30:54.281
The shores of England.

956
01:30:54.281 --> 01:30:56.624
\h\h\h\h\h\hAnd looks like
there’s a storm blowing in.

957
01:30:56.624 --> 01:30:58.692
Keep your eyes on the deck.

958
01:31:55.177 --> 01:31:57.619
I can’t see a bloody thing.

959
01:32:00.380 --> 01:32:01.722
Quiet.

960
01:32:07.255 --> 01:32:08.960
You don’t need to be here.

961
01:32:09.895 --> 01:32:12.898
You could stay below deck
\h\h\hwith Captain Eliot.

962
01:32:14.394 --> 01:32:16.165
Stay safe.

963
01:32:17.606 --> 01:32:20.532
We are connected.
the devil and I.

964
01:32:20.532 --> 01:32:23.711
You are smart enough
\h\hto have noticed.

965
01:32:23.711 --> 01:32:25.977
I can sense him.

966
01:32:27.209 --> 01:32:29.277
Feel him somehow.

967
01:32:30.949 --> 01:32:32.852
He feels it. too.

968
01:32:34.953 --> 01:32:36.922
He will come for me.

969
01:32:38.418 --> 01:32:41.025
And while he’s focused on me.
\h\h\h\hyou know what to do.

01:36:05.757 --> 01:36:07.264
\h\h\hCLEMENS:
I’ll find ’em!

991
01:36:07.264 --> 01:36:08.837
Cut the ropes if you have to.
\h\h\h\h\h\hbut get it free!

992
01:36:33.323 --> 01:36:35.193
Forgive me.

993
01:36:36.689 --> 01:36:38.691
\h\h-

994
01:36:43.102 --> 01:36:45.500
Wojchek!

995
01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:47.370
\h\h-

996
01:36:53.475 --> 01:36:56.049
\h\h\h-

997
01:37:00.856 --> 01:37:02.682
Wojchek!

998
01:37:10.294 --> 01:37:12.527
Where are you?

999
01:37:15.035 --> 01:37:16.366
Wojchek.

1000
01:37:25.078 --> 01:37:27.344
Anna.

1001
01:37:27.344 --> 01:37:28.708
Captain.

1002
01:37:41.930 --> 01:37:43.932
Captain!

1003
01:37:43.932 --> 01:37:46.759
He’s coming. He’s coming!

1004
01:38:00.575 --> 01:38:02.742
Anna!

1005
01:38:02.742 --> 01:38:03.919
Captain!

1006
01:38:14.094 --> 01:38:16.855
Oh. my Lord.

1007
01:38:20.199 --> 01:38:24.731
I renounce you. devil!

1008
01:38:25.941 --> 01:38:28.537
I renounce you...

1009
01:38:58.633 --> 01:39:00.074
Captain.

1010
01:39:15.452 --> 01:39:16.882
Mr. Clemens.

1011
01:39:17.817 --> 01:39:19.654
Let them know. will you?

1012
01:39:19.654 --> 01:39:24.593
Let them know I was true...

1013
01:39:24.593 --> 01:39:26.496
to my trust.

1014
01:39:27.959 --> 01:39:31.534
I will. Captain. I promise.

1015
01:40:07.339 --> 01:40:10.639
You want them to believe
\h\h\hthat you’re a god!

1016
01:40:11.871 --> 01:40:13.774
You and I both know
\hthat you’re not!

1017
01:40:15.347 --> 01:40:18.482
You bleed like any of us!

1018
01:40:18.482 --> 01:40:22.486
You sleep in dirt!

1019
01:40:22.486 --> 01:40:24.422
You feed!

1020
01:40:24.422 --> 01:40:26.853
Above all else. you feed!

1021
01:40:26.853 --> 01:40:29.757
You want us to... to fear you!

1022
01:40:29.757 --> 01:40:33.167
Underneath. you’re afraid!

1023
01:40:33.167 --> 01:40:35.598
\h\h\h\h\hYou’re afraid of
what lies on the other side

1024
01:40:35.598 --> 01:40:38.205
as any other living thing!

1025
01:40:38.205 --> 01:40:40.834
\h-

1026
01:41:17.145 --> 01:41:18.872
\h-

1027
01:41:24.482 --> 01:41:26.715
You are in my head.

1028
01:41:26.715 --> 01:41:28.156
In my blood.

1029
01:41:30.158 --> 01:41:31.555
You have damned me to hell!

1030
01:41:31.555 --> 01:41:32.886
\h-

1031
01:41:35.790 --> 01:41:37.165
\h-

1032
01:41:45.404 --> 01:41:46.603
You bastard!

1033
01:41:49.474 --> 01:41:52.279
\h\h\h\h\h-Anna!

1034
01:41:52.279 --> 01:41:53.874
Anna. get to the boat.

1035
01:41:56.250 --> 01:41:58.186
\h\h-

1036
01:42:07.118 --> 01:42:09.461
I do not...

1037
01:42:09.461 --> 01:42:11.925
f-fear you.

1038
01:42:17.370 --> 01:42:19.834
You will.

1039
01:42:34.387 --> 01:42:36.455
Die. you devil!

1040
01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:14.955
\h\h-

1041
01:43:30.575 --> 01:43:32.247
Jesus.

1042
01:43:32.247 --> 01:43:34.106
\h\h\h\h\h-BOY: What’s wrong?
-Run and fetch the constable.

1043
01:43:34.106 --> 01:43:36.108
Tell him there’s a ship trying
\hto get through the breakers.

1044
01:44:24.827 --> 01:44:26.961
The coast...

1045
01:44:26.961 --> 01:44:29.062
so close.

1046
01:44:31.933 --> 01:44:34.265
It’s close.

1047
01:44:37.939 --> 01:44:39.479
Mr. Clemens.

1048
01:44:42.350 --> 01:44:44.011
No.

1049
01:44:44.011 --> 01:44:47.179
No. No.

1050
01:44:47.179 --> 01:44:48.389
No.

1051
01:44:49.819 --> 01:44:53.020
I have known for days now.

1052
01:44:54.461 --> 01:44:55.990
I’m sorry.

1053
01:44:55.990 --> 01:44:57.926
Another transfusion...

1054
01:44:57.926 --> 01:45:00.368
Would only delay
\hthe inevitable.

1055
01:45:00.368 --> 01:45:01.831
We both know that.

1056
01:45:01.831 --> 01:45:03.635
But I can... I can...

1057
01:45:03.635 --> 01:45:06.000
-If I just...
\h\h\h\h-No.

1058
01:45:07.969 --> 01:45:10.004
I don’t want to become...

1059
01:45:13.810 --> 01:45:15.713
My whole life...

1060
01:45:17.484 --> 01:45:19.651
...my people.

1061
01:45:19.651 --> 01:45:22.621
the devil.

1062
01:45:22.621 --> 01:45:24.623
they chose for me.

1063
01:45:26.053 --> 01:45:28.286
I choose this.

1064
01:45:28.286 --> 01:45:29.958
No one else.

1065
01:45:33.962 --> 01:45:36.063
You saved me.

1066
01:45:36.063 --> 01:45:38.296
And you me.

1067
01:46:49.939 --> 01:46:51.776
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hIt’s all about
the ghost ship at Whitby.

1068
01:46:51.776 --> 01:46:52.975
No survivors.

1069
01:46:52.975 --> 01:46:54.548
How about you. sir?

1070
01:46:54.548 --> 01:46:56.484
The Dailygraph?

1071
01:46:56.484 --> 01:46:58.816
\h\h\hGet your paper here.
only a cost of a tuppence.

1072
01:47:00.411 --> 01:47:02.556
It’s all about the ghost ship
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hat Whitby.

1073
01:47:02.556 --> 01:47:04.283
No survivors.

1074
01:47:11.422 --> 01:47:14.469
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hCLEMENS:
I’ve arrived in London.

1075
01:47:14.469 --> 01:47:19.232
The creature hunts for blood
\h\h\hsomewhere in the city.

1076
01:47:19.232 --> 01:47:23.071
but I know where it lays
to rest during the day.

1077
01:47:23.071 --> 01:47:24.809
\h\hBARMAID:
Carfax Abbey?

1078
01:47:24.809 --> 01:47:27.273
You the new owner?

1079
01:47:27.273 --> 01:47:29.484
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hCLEMENS:
No. miss. Just looking for him.

1080
01:47:29.484 --> 01:47:32.245
Oh. well. it’s a couple hours
\h\h\h\h\hto reach the abbey

1081
01:47:32.245 --> 01:47:34.654
in a carriage from here.

1082
01:47:34.654 --> 01:47:36.854
It gets dark on the moors.

1083
01:47:36.854 --> 01:47:39.593
\h\h\h\h\hIf I was you.
I’d wait till morning.

1084
01:47:39.593 --> 01:47:42.090
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYou know. miss.
I was thinking the same thing.

1085
01:47:54.608 --> 01:47:56.610
\h\h\hI have finally seen
the true darkness

1086
01:47:56.610 --> 01:47:59.943
\h\h\hthat dwells beneath
the surface of this world.

1087
01:47:59.943 --> 01:48:05.113
the evil that neither science
\h\h\hnor reason can explain.

1088
01:48:05.113 --> 01:48:07.852
Yet I have also seen its beauty

1089
01:48:07.852 --> 01:48:11.086
and those willing to give all
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hto protect it.

1090
01:49:10.882 --> 01:49:14.215
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hAnd so
I will pursue this foul beast.

1091
01:49:14.215 --> 01:49:17.251
\h\h\hAnd I swear by those
who have given their lives

1092
01:49:17.251 --> 01:49:20.353
that I will extinguish
\h\h\h\h\hthis blight

1093
01:49:20.353 --> 01:49:23.730
and send it back to hell.
