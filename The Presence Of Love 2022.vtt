Woman:
"Behold her.

00:00:13.734 --> 00:00:15.266
"single in the field.

7
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.433
"Yon solitary Highland lass.

8
00:00:17.567 --> 00:00:20.567
"reaping and singing by herself.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.233
"Stop here. or gently pass.

10
00:00:23.367 --> 00:00:25.300
"Alone she cuts and binds
the grain.

00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:28.400
"and sings a melancholy strain.

00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:33.700
"is overflowing with the sound.

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:35.900
"No sweeter voice was ever heard

"in springtime

"Breaking the silence

"among the furthest Hebrides.

"Will no one tell me

"Perhaps the plaintive
numbers flow

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.400
"for old unhappy far-off things
and battles long ago.

21
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.600
"Whate'er the theme.
the maiden sang

22
00:00:55.734 --> 00:00:58.633
"as if her song
could have no ending.

23
00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:02.533
"I saw her singing at her work
and o'er the sickle bending.

24
00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:04.834
"The music in my heart I bore.

25
00:01:04.967 --> 00:01:09.000
"long after it was heard
no more."

26
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:11.333
It's crazy. I have read that
poem a million times

27
00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:13.367
and it's now only just
coming to life.

28
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.200
Ah. well.
that's Wordsworth for you.

29
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:17.767
This is what I meant about
his connection

30
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.667
to the natural world.

31
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.467
He believed that poetry should
be written to provide pleasure

32
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.934
through a rhythmic and powerful
expression of emotion.

33
00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:29.533
It's risky to say
what we're feeling.

34
00:01:29.667 --> 00:01:31.266
Scary. even.

35
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.767
Well. I have to admit.
I was a little scared about

36
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.533
taking this class. but I've
actually really enjoyed it.

37
00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:39.033
Are you coming back next
semester?

38
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:40.967
Dr. Tompkins will be back
from sabbatical.

39
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.767
but I am-- I'm working on it.

40
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.800
Well. I hope so.
you have been incredible.

41
00:01:44.934 --> 00:01:46.633
Great example of hyperbole.

42
00:01:46.767 --> 00:01:48.633
You've clearly been paying attention.

43
00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:52.133
Oh. and as a thank you.

44
00:01:52.266 --> 00:01:54.834
I got you some of that British
chocolate that you love.

45
00:01:54.967 --> 00:01:56.934
My friend brought it back from
her studies abroad.

46
00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:58.433
You're my favorite student.

47
00:01:58.567 --> 00:02:00.900
I try.

48
00:02:01.033 --> 00:02:02.600
See you later. Bye.

49
00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:05.867
Next.

50
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.433
Dr. Lambert?

51
00:02:12.867 --> 00:02:14.200
Dean Grant.

52
00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:15.600
May I?

53
00:02:15.734 --> 00:02:17.900
Uh. please.

54
00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:19.900
Looks like you've made a lot
of fans here

55
00:02:20.033 --> 00:02:21.767
over the last three months.

56
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.567
Well. luckily I happen to be
teaching my favorite subject.

57
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.166
Well. it shows. Joss.

58
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.266
Well. hopefully it will give me
a better shot

59
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.600
at my interview next month.

60
00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:32.500
I know that tenure track positions

61
00:02:32.633 --> 00:02:34.100
are extremely competitive

62
00:02:34.233 --> 00:02:36.367
so if there's anything else
I can do to stand out...

63
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.433
Well. getting the interview in
the first place

64
00:02:38.567 --> 00:02:40.166
is half the battle.

65
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.767
But...

66
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.367
I just heard from
the Literary Review.

67
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.266
They kicked your paper back.

68
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.033
You're kidding.

69
00:02:48.166 --> 00:02:50.834
They're intrigued by your
dissection of Wordsworth's work.

70
00:02:50.967 --> 00:02:53.400
but they're not feeling like
you're saying anything new.

71
00:02:53.533 --> 00:02:55.166
Something is missing.

72
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.433
Also your lack of published work
is a problem.

73
00:02:58.567 --> 00:02:59.867
I've been published.

74
00:03:00.066 --> 00:03:02.567
But it hasn't been cited
or won any awards.

75
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.967
Department funding is vital
for this.

76
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.900
Funding...

77
00:03:07.033 --> 00:03:08.800
You know I'm on your side.

78
00:03:08.934 --> 00:03:10.400
Yes. I'm sorry.

79
00:03:10.533 --> 00:03:13.967
They're giving you two weeks
to re-submit.

80
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.133
You know. when I was your age.

81
00:03:16.266 --> 00:03:18.467
there were a lot of roadblocks.
and I pushed through

82
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.133
and I worked hard.

83
00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:22.633
Sometimes I thought I couldn't
do it. but I did.

84
00:03:22.767 --> 00:03:25.166
And I know you can too...

85
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.934
Joss?

86
00:03:28.066 --> 00:03:29.467
Are you okay?

87
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.834
I'm fine.

88
00:03:31.967 --> 00:03:33.600
Two weeks. Okay?

89
00:03:33.734 --> 00:03:35.166
Okay.
Okay.

90
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.500
I don't get it. you've taught
at five different universities.

91
00:04:07.633 --> 00:04:09.800
Sure. places that are smaller.

92
00:04:09.934 --> 00:04:12.367
and where your teaching ability
matters more

93
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.300
than how many books
I haven't published.

94
00:04:14.433 --> 00:04:16.700
Yes. but you served on the
faculty committee at this one.

95
00:04:16.834 --> 00:04:19.133
And you organized that week-long
reading retreat last year.

96
00:04:19.266 --> 00:04:21.166
which was incredible.
by the way.

97
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.367
I wish that mattered. Gwen.
but you know the saying.

98
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.700
It's publish or perish.

99
00:04:24.834 --> 00:04:26.667
That mentality
is too intense for me.

100
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.667
That's why I love being a librarian.

101
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.667
The most pressure I face
is collecting late fees.

102
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.033
Which you are horrible at.

103
00:04:32.166 --> 00:04:33.533
I know. I'm a real softy.

104
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.066
Ugh. I just wish I knew how to
get out of my head about this.

105
00:04:40.533 --> 00:04:43.333
Actually. um.

106
00:04:43.467 --> 00:04:45.400
I've been carrying this
around all week

107
00:04:45.533 --> 00:04:48.533
just waiting for the right time
to give it to you.

108
00:04:48.667 --> 00:04:49.800
What's this?

109
00:04:49.934 --> 00:04:52.533
It's a present.
From your mom.

110
00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:54.333
When was this?

111
00:04:54.467 --> 00:04:57.033
About a year ago. when her
health started taking a turn.

112
00:04:57.166 --> 00:05:01.033
You know Carol. always putting
everyone else first.

113
00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:02.433
Open it.

114
00:05:14.867 --> 00:05:17.433
She gave me specific
instructions to give this to you

115
00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:19.400
two weeks before your 35th birthday.

116
00:05:19.533 --> 00:05:21.467
Cornwall...

117
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.967
It's my job to make sure you go.

118
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.467
This was the year I promised
we would finally

119
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.100
go visit her family farm.
the one that she grew up on.

120
00:05:30.767 --> 00:05:32.533
She wanted to show me
the literary festival.

121
00:05:32.667 --> 00:05:36.667
She thought of everything.
Airfare. taxi. train fare.

122
00:05:38.667 --> 00:05:39.767
This ticket is for Monday.

123
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.133
Better start packing.

124
00:05:41.266 --> 00:05:42.867
I can't just pick up
and go to England.

125
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.433
What better place to write a
paper about English poets

126
00:05:44.567 --> 00:05:45.700
than England?

127
00:05:45.834 --> 00:05:47.300
What do I tell the dean?

128
00:05:47.433 --> 00:05:50.266
You could come up with a million
reasons not to do this.

129
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.734
but you made her a promise.

130
00:05:52.867 --> 00:05:54.600
You've barely done anything
for yourself

131
00:05:54.734 --> 00:05:55.867
since she passed away.

132
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.734
She wanted this for you.

133
00:05:57.867 --> 00:05:59.233
What if something happens?

134
00:05:59.367 --> 00:06:01.300
Like what? Killer sheep?

135
00:06:01.433 --> 00:06:02.800
You know what I mean.

136
00:06:02.934 --> 00:06:05.300
What if my anxiety gets really
bad over there?

137
00:06:05.433 --> 00:06:07.500
Then you use the techniques
your doctor gave you.

138
00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:11.767
In the meantime. eat right.
exercise. and take your meds.

139
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.533
You can call me anytime
you want.

140
00:06:14.667 --> 00:06:15.967
In fact. you should
call me often

141
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.133
so I can live vicariously
through you.

142
00:06:19.266 --> 00:06:20.700
Go. Joss.

143
00:06:22.133 --> 00:06:23.734
You need this.

144
00:06:29.734 --> 00:06:33.867
♪ Oh-oh-oh ♪

145
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.367
♪ Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh ♪

146
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.066
♪ Oh-oh-oh ♪

147
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.467
♪ Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh ♪

148
00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:07.600
Tegan. love. I think the
chickens have had

149
00:07:07.734 --> 00:07:09.700
quite enough breakfast
for the moment.

150
00:07:09.834 --> 00:07:12.800
They're looking quite plump
as it is. sweetheart.

151
00:07:15.834 --> 00:07:17.266
Tegan?

152
00:07:18.367 --> 00:07:20.333
Penny for your thoughts?

153
00:07:20.467 --> 00:07:22.500
I just don't know why they're
making us read our poems

154
00:07:22.633 --> 00:07:24.000
at the festival.

155
00:07:24.133 --> 00:07:26.266
Because you've been
working hard on them.

156
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.033
and letting the kids read one of
their poems at the festival

157
00:07:29.166 --> 00:07:30.333
is a tradition.

158
00:07:30.467 --> 00:07:31.834
We're not even done
with them yet.

159
00:07:31.967 --> 00:07:34.000
What if I don't finish?
What if I mess up?

160
00:07:34.133 --> 00:07:35.767
Hey.

161
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.934
That's the beauty
of creative writing.

162
00:07:38.066 --> 00:07:40.600
You can't go wrong. 'cause
anything you say is original.

163
00:07:40.734 --> 00:07:41.867
Okay?

164
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.333
Okay.
Yeah?

165
00:07:44.467 --> 00:07:45.700
Come one.

166
00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:48.867
Oh.

167
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.266
There we go.

168
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.100
Right. Now nip inside.
grab your backpack

169
00:07:52.233 --> 00:07:54.266
before Gran realizes we haven't
left yet. all right?

170
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.900
Oi! Forgetting something.
are we?

171
00:07:57.033 --> 00:07:58.467
Good girl. okay.

172
00:08:01.066 --> 00:08:02.734
Thanks. Gran.

173
00:08:02.867 --> 00:08:05.567
Glad I could be of service.
You two should be long gone.

174
00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.500
It's my fault.
I was feeding the chickens.

175
00:08:07.633 --> 00:08:09.834
It was my fault. I was stripping
the bed in the guest cottage.

176
00:08:09.967 --> 00:08:11.667
Just trying to keep on top
of the bookings.

177
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.333
You're trying to drive me mad
is what you're doing.

178
00:08:13.467 --> 00:08:14.734
I already changed them.

179
00:08:14.867 --> 00:08:17.266
Right. well then.
Just making double sure.

180
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.967
I don't know why I bother.

181
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.500
If that next booking
ever turns up. I'll be amazed.

182
00:08:21.633 --> 00:08:23.934
They reserved it nearly a year
ago and never confirmed.

183
00:08:24.066 --> 00:08:25.600
At least they paid in full.

184
00:08:25.734 --> 00:08:28.567
How you got me playing
chambermaid. I shall never know.

185
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:29.934
I think it rather suits you.

186
00:08:30.066 --> 00:08:31.433
Oh. I'm sure you're
tickled pink.

187
00:08:31.567 --> 00:08:33.633
Now it's your turn to play chauffeur

188
00:08:33.767 --> 00:08:36.400
and get this little princess
to school.

189
00:08:36.533 --> 00:08:39.400
Right. come on. you.
With pleasure.

190
00:08:41.233 --> 00:08:42.700
Your grace.

191
00:08:43.734 --> 00:08:44.900
Your lordship.

192
00:08:46.367 --> 00:08:48.166
Good boy.

193
00:09:10.166 --> 00:09:11.467
Hey!

194
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.000
You okay?

195
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.700
You were looking the wrong way.

196
00:09:15.834 --> 00:09:18.567
Wish I could say it was the
first time it's happened here.

197
00:09:21.133 --> 00:09:23.000
You all right?

198
00:09:23.133 --> 00:09:24.767
Yeah.

199
00:09:26.367 --> 00:09:28.000
Can I have my arm back?

200
00:09:29.266 --> 00:09:30.867
Of course. I'm sorry.

201
00:09:32.166 --> 00:09:33.300
Uh...

202
00:09:33.433 --> 00:09:35.233
Oh. I can help you with that.

203
00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:36.567
Are you my driver?

204
00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.200
Only if you're Jocelyn Lambert.

205
00:09:38.333 --> 00:09:40.967
Everyone calls me Joss.
but yes.

206
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.200
yes. that's me.

207
00:09:42.333 --> 00:09:44.700
Welcome to Cornwall.
I'm Daniel.

208
00:09:54.834 --> 00:09:56.166
What are you
smuggling in here?

209
00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.500
Books.
Books?

210
00:09:57.633 --> 00:09:59.800
We've got libraries full
of them here.

211
00:09:59.934 --> 00:10:03.300
Actually. we're quite well-known
for our written word.

212
00:10:03.433 --> 00:10:06.033
All right. party is over.
In the back with you.

213
00:10:08.033 --> 00:10:09.700
Come on. Samson. in the back.

214
00:10:09.834 --> 00:10:11.467
It's okay.
I can sit in the back.

215
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.367
He's just being stubborn.
He'll get there.

216
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.033
Oh. come on. Samson.

217
00:10:15.166 --> 00:10:16.567
I prefer it. actually.

218
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.900
Real classy. mate.

219
00:10:29.767 --> 00:10:34.433
♪ Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh ♪

220
00:10:35.467 --> 00:10:38.734
♪ Oh-oh-oh-oh ♪

221
00:10:38.867 --> 00:10:42.400
Direct route or scenic?

222
00:10:42.533 --> 00:10:43.867
I'll let you choose.

223
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.066
Oh. it's a no-brainer for me.

224
00:11:16.834 --> 00:11:18.200
Is it ready?

225
00:11:18.333 --> 00:11:20.934
Patience. my lovely.
You have to let it brew.

226
00:11:21.066 --> 00:11:23.033
Why don't you use a teabag
like dad?

227
00:11:23.166 --> 00:11:26.700
Because ladies use loose leaf.
like the queen.

228
00:11:26.834 --> 00:11:28.800
Daddy just presses on the bag
with a spoon.

229
00:11:28.934 --> 00:11:30.400
So does Tarzan. I suppose.

230
00:11:30.533 --> 00:11:31.934
But if you want to do it properly.

231
00:11:32.066 --> 00:11:33.433
you'll do it as I've shown you.

232
00:11:33.567 --> 00:11:35.967
Now you always
put the milk in first.

233
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.767
Before you fill the teacup.

234
00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.100
Not everything can be done
on a whim

235
00:11:42.233 --> 00:11:44.300
no matter what your father
tells you.

236
00:11:44.433 --> 00:11:46.266
What about jam and clotted
cream?

237
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.934
Jam first. of course.

238
00:11:49.934 --> 00:11:51.867
Felix!

239
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.567
Just finish your scone.

240
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.967
Hello. Felix.

241
00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.867
Mrs. Carter.
You're looking lovely today.

242
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.834
May I ask why
you're disturbing my sheep?

243
00:12:07.967 --> 00:12:09.266
I take it Danny failed
to mention

244
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.834
that I would be
stopping by today.

245
00:12:10.967 --> 00:12:12.300
He most certainly did.

246
00:12:12.433 --> 00:12:13.700
Brilliant.

247
00:12:13.834 --> 00:12:16.533
If it's about those monstrosities.

248
00:12:16.667 --> 00:12:19.133
you can save your breath
and my time.

249
00:12:19.266 --> 00:12:22.000
They're wind turbines.
Mrs. Carter. not Voldemort.

250
00:12:22.133 --> 00:12:23.667
It's all right to speak of them.

251
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.700
Oh. I know what they are. Felix.
I just don't want them.

252
00:12:25.834 --> 00:12:29.500
Well. shall we go in for a cuppa

253
00:12:29.633 --> 00:12:31.166
and have one of your famous
scones?

254
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.867
I don't remember inviting you
to tea and scones.

255
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.433
Come on. look.

256
00:12:35.567 --> 00:12:37.100
she's holding them up in the
window. isn't she?

257
00:12:37.233 --> 00:12:39.500
Merryn:
That's my granddaughter.

258
00:12:39.633 --> 00:12:41.033
She's having scones.

259
00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.500
Felix:
Here's Danny now.

260
00:12:59.166 --> 00:13:01.233
Do you want to tell me
what this is all about?

261
00:13:02.667 --> 00:13:05.000
Oh. hi. I'm sorry.
I'm Joss.

262
00:13:05.133 --> 00:13:06.734
I'm staying at the cottage.

263
00:13:06.867 --> 00:13:10.033
Well. that's lovely dear.
but I'm not talking to you.

264
00:13:10.166 --> 00:13:12.433
I'm talking to that
driver of yours.

265
00:13:12.567 --> 00:13:15.734
I asked Felix to come by
to explain our options.

266
00:13:15.867 --> 00:13:18.166
It's a great opportunity
in a growing industry.

267
00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.533
We have an industry. sheep.

268
00:13:21.667 --> 00:13:24.767
You've already turned my
mill house into a cheap motel.

269
00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:27.433
Forgive me if I don't want the
rest of the farm

270
00:13:27.567 --> 00:13:29.800
looking like an Orwell novel.

271
00:13:34.533 --> 00:13:38.166
I'm sorry about my mother.
she's in one of her moods.

272
00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:39.400
I take it you didn't
talk to her. then.

273
00:13:39.533 --> 00:13:41.000
I was working up to it.

274
00:13:41.133 --> 00:13:43.600
You're not just my driver.
are you?

275
00:13:43.734 --> 00:13:45.233
I wear many hats.

276
00:13:45.367 --> 00:13:48.233
Too many. if you ask me.
Right. I'll be off.

277
00:13:48.367 --> 00:13:50.934
It was lovely to meet you. miss.
Hope you have a pleasant stay.

278
00:13:51.066 --> 00:13:53.367
And give me a buzz.

279
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.934
Excuse me for not introducing
myself properly.

280
00:13:56.066 --> 00:13:57.400
I'm Daniel Carter.

281
00:13:57.533 --> 00:13:58.867
Some say I run the farm
around here.

282
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.500
I say the farm runs me.

283
00:14:01.633 --> 00:14:03.033
Right this way.

284
00:14:12.433 --> 00:14:14.100
So you have your own washing
machine downstairs.

285
00:14:14.233 --> 00:14:17.333
That's great. Do you have a
printer. by chance?

286
00:14:17.467 --> 00:14:20.233
Uh. no. not here.
but we have one in the house.

287
00:14:20.367 --> 00:14:22.567
so just knock
and you can use it anytime.

288
00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.133
Uh. which is also where
breakfast is served.

289
00:14:24.266 --> 00:14:26.600
usually by my mother.
Oh. okay.

290
00:14:26.734 --> 00:14:28.066
I know she comes off
a bit gruff.

291
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.667
she doesn't mean anything by it.

292
00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.166
I did appreciate the Orwell
reference. though.

293
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.467
Yeah. she's very well-read.

294
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.667
but sharp minds have sharp tongues.

295
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.100
Consider yourself warned.

296
00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:46.300
Well. I'm sure your knackered.
so I'll let you settle in.

297
00:14:46.433 --> 00:14:47.800
Oh. and if you need
- the Wi-
- Fi code.

298
00:14:47.934 --> 00:14:50.800
it's in the guest book
under my mobile number.

299
00:14:50.934 --> 00:14:52.734
If you have any questions.
best to ask me.

300
00:14:52.867 --> 00:14:55.100
Oh. and if you want to stretch
your legs.

301
00:14:55.233 --> 00:14:56.900
the sea is up and over
the hill a bit.

302
00:14:57.033 --> 00:14:58.767
You can't miss it.

303
00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.233
Thank you.

304
00:15:17.533 --> 00:15:19.867
"Flopsy and Mopsy and Cottontail

305
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.500
"had bread and milk
and blackberries for supper."

306
00:15:22.633 --> 00:15:25.533
"The end."

307
00:15:25.667 --> 00:15:27.900
So. do you want to tell me about
your day now?

308
00:15:28.033 --> 00:15:30.066
It was fine. dad.

309
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.567
Fine? That's all I get.

310
00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.166
Okay then.

311
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:36.867
Well. you should get to sleep.

312
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.066
So. good night. good night.

313
00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.567
mind the bedbugs don't bite.

314
00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.367
Ahh!
Dad. stop!

315
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.300
Okay. okay. Suit yourself.

316
00:15:46.433 --> 00:15:47.667
I love you.

317
00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.200
I love you too.

318
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.734
What if something happens?

319
00:16:22.367 --> 00:16:24.000
They're giving you two weeks
to resubmit.

320
00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.834
Okay. Mom.

321
00:16:31.433 --> 00:16:33.266
I'm here.

322
00:16:35.433 --> 00:16:36.834
Now what?

323
00:16:51.667 --> 00:16:53.767
Daniel:
Felix is coming by today.

324
00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.967
I thought we'd settled
that matter.

325
00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:57.600
We're just having a coffee.

326
00:16:57.734 --> 00:17:00.767
Good. Try to keep your grand
ideas to a minimum.

327
00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:03.333
I'm trying to put my business
degree to work out here.

328
00:17:03.467 --> 00:17:05.333
You traded in livestock futures.

329
00:17:05.467 --> 00:17:06.867
And what's that supposed
to mean. exactly?

330
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.500
You were hardly the Wolf of Wall
Street. were you?

331
00:17:10.633 --> 00:17:12.867
More like the sheep of Southampton.

332
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.867
I can still hear you.

333
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
All I'm saying is the country
suits you.

334
00:17:30.967 --> 00:17:32.100
Hi there. buddy!

335
00:17:32.233 --> 00:17:33.667
Sampson. no!

336
00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.934
Oh. it's okay.
we've met.

337
00:17:36.066 --> 00:17:37.767
But I haven't met you yet.
I'm Joss.

338
00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:39.300
I'm Tegan.

339
00:17:39.433 --> 00:17:42.133
Dad says I'm not supposed to
bother the guests.

340
00:17:42.266 --> 00:17:43.800
Oh. you're not bothering me.

341
00:17:43.934 --> 00:17:46.367
Tell me. Tegan. has he ever
eaten your homework?

342
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.867
No.
No?

343
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.367
Well. maybe he could eat mine.

344
00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:51.800
You have homework?

345
00:17:51.934 --> 00:17:54.500
Sort of. I'm just writing a
research paper.

346
00:17:54.633 --> 00:17:56.700
which is proving trickier
than I thought.

347
00:17:56.834 --> 00:17:58.633
I find writing tricky. too.

348
00:17:58.767 --> 00:18:00.166
Is it?

349
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.900
Sometimes.

350
00:18:02.033 --> 00:18:03.700
Well. I'm a teacher. so if you
ever have any questions

351
00:18:03.834 --> 00:18:06.400
or you need any help.
feel free to ask. okay?

352
00:18:06.533 --> 00:18:07.900
Thanks!

353
00:18:08.033 --> 00:18:09.400
As long as it's okay
with your mom and dad.

354
00:18:09.533 --> 00:18:12.000
It's just my Dad.
Well. and Gran. of course.

355
00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:15.533
Okay. well. make sure you ask
her too. yeah?

356
00:18:15.667 --> 00:18:17.000
Are you afraid of her?

357
00:18:17.133 --> 00:18:18.934
What. of your Gran?

358
00:18:19.066 --> 00:18:21.867
It's quite all right.
My friend Lily is afraid. too.

359
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.567
But she's really lovely to me.

360
00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:25.433
I'm sure she is.

361
00:18:25.567 --> 00:18:26.934
First bell is in 15.
are you ready?

362
00:18:27.066 --> 00:18:28.867
Yeah.

363
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.700
Ah.

364
00:18:30.834 --> 00:18:32.567
How'd you sleep?

365
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.533
Okay.

366
00:18:34.667 --> 00:18:36.000
That doesn't sound very convincing.

367
00:18:36.133 --> 00:18:37.934
Oh. sorry. no.

368
00:18:38.066 --> 00:18:40.266
I can't even blame it
on the jetlag.

369
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.700
I'm just not a great sleeper.

370
00:18:41.834 --> 00:18:43.367
It has nothing to do with
the cottage.

371
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:44.834
Maybe the fresh air will help
with that.

372
00:18:44.967 --> 00:18:46.433
Any plans?

373
00:18:46.567 --> 00:18:49.767
No. I just have this research
paper to work on.

374
00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.033
You flew all this way to work?

375
00:18:51.166 --> 00:18:53.233
Big deadline coming up.

376
00:18:53.367 --> 00:18:54.700
Daniel:
Well. good luck.

377
00:18:54.834 --> 00:18:56.367
Thank you.
Come on. you.

378
00:18:58.967 --> 00:19:00.467
Your turn to drive. Teeg.

379
00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:01.734
Tegan:

380
00:19:01.867 --> 00:19:03.667

388
00:19:52.767 --> 00:19:53.967
and she said.
"You're not invited!"

389
00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.467
No...
Yeah!

390
00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.300
I mean. I've jumped that fence
1.000 times.

391
00:19:57.433 --> 00:19:59.667
Who knew that this was going to
be the final straw. eh?

392
00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.166
Where is she. anyway?

393
00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:02.800
Out with her precious sheep.

394
00:20:02.934 --> 00:20:05.000
Ah. great. so we can talk
more freely.

395
00:20:05.133 --> 00:20:07.400
Every month. it gets more strained.

396
00:20:07.533 --> 00:20:09.066
Every suggestion I make.
she hates.

397
00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.567
I thought she would have been
thrilled to see you

398
00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:11.800
and Tegan at the farm.

399
00:20:11.934 --> 00:20:13.467
Tegan. yeah. but she treats me

400
00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.266
like the Spanish invading Cornwall.

401
00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.500
I mean. a little warning would
have been nice.

402
00:20:17.633 --> 00:20:19.000
Ah. come on. you know my mum.

403
00:20:19.133 --> 00:20:21.567
I do. she acts tough.
but we both know

404
00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:23.300
that I've been her favorite
since primary school.

405
00:20:23.433 --> 00:20:24.934
Debatable.
Come on!

406
00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:30.266
Look. I'm sorry. but all these
half measures you're doing

407
00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.100
to try to diversify
the farm. well.

408
00:20:33.233 --> 00:20:35.266
we know they're not going to
make much difference. are they?

409
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.600
This... this is your long-term.

410
00:20:38.734 --> 00:20:40.000
What. leasing my land to you?

411
00:20:40.133 --> 00:20:43.467
Not me. These beauties.

412
00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.266
I mean. she does have a point.
they do look rather dystopian.

413
00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.967
More science fiction.
if you ask me.

414
00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:51.133
Don't look at me like that.

415
00:20:51.266 --> 00:20:52.767
It was your idea
in the first place.

416
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.934
I know. But I also know
what she's going to say.

417
00:20:55.066 --> 00:20:57.233
That we're sheep farmers.
that's who we are.

418
00:20:57.367 --> 00:20:59.500
that's who we've always been.
And that they're going to ruin

419
00:20:59.633 --> 00:21:01.233
the landscape she built
with my father.

420
00:21:01.367 --> 00:21:03.033
Not totally.
No. not totally.

421
00:21:03.166 --> 00:21:04.867
I just need to find
the right time.

422
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
All right. well. they're not
gonna wait around much longer.

423
00:21:07.133 --> 00:21:09.367
They'll simply just offer
the contract to someone else.

424
00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.700
So can I check in next week?

425
00:21:11.834 --> 00:21:14.033
Yeah.
Right.

426
00:21:14.166 --> 00:21:16.300
Am I going to see you at
Harbor's Head this weekend?

427
00:21:16.433 --> 00:21:19.000
Two o'clock? Lily is requesting
Tegan's presence.

428
00:21:19.133 --> 00:21:21.200
No. I've got so much work
to do on the farm.

429
00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.567
We'll be there.

430
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.200

Hey there. buddy.

What are you up to?

442
00:23:07.967 --> 00:23:10.767
Not much. he hasn't lifted a paw
to help me.

443
00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.033
Wow.

444
00:23:15.166 --> 00:23:16.934
Quite the wall.

445
00:23:17.066 --> 00:23:18.367
Oh. it's built the Cornish way.

446
00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:20.700
You put mud between the stones

447
00:23:20.834 --> 00:23:22.734
so the plants can grow
between them.

448
00:23:22.867 --> 00:23:24.533
Fascinating.

449
00:23:24.667 --> 00:23:26.367
And very tedious.

450
00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.867
I've been at it a year and still
haven't fixed half the problems.

451
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.066
Sounds a bit like
my research paper.

452
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.900
A bit mucked up. then?

453
00:23:33.033 --> 00:23:34.734
So what brings you out here?

454
00:23:34.867 --> 00:23:37.266
Just stretching my legs. ruminating.

455
00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.800
Procrastinating.

456
00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:41.700
Do you want a hand?

457
00:23:43.367 --> 00:23:46.367
I'd rather build a wall
than bang my head against one.

458
00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:49.834
All right.
but you will get dirty.

459
00:23:49.967 --> 00:23:53.667
It's okay.
my B&B has a laundry machine.

460
00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.533
Posh.

461
00:23:55.667 --> 00:23:57.433
Here.

462
00:23:57.567 --> 00:23:58.700
And you use this.

463
00:23:58.834 --> 00:24:00.200
Oh. thanks.

464
00:24:03.233 --> 00:24:07.233
So. you're a literature
professor?

465
00:24:07.367 --> 00:24:09.133
What got you into that?

466
00:24:09.266 --> 00:24:12.600
Well. my Mom and my grandparents
introduced me to the classics

467
00:24:12.734 --> 00:24:15.600
when I was. well.
probably Tegan's age.

468
00:24:15.734 --> 00:24:19.233
Is that why you bring all
your books with you?

469
00:24:19.367 --> 00:24:22.000
Ah. it's for my research
on Wordsworth.

470
00:24:22.133 --> 00:24:23.266
Oh. the footballer.

471
00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.000
The poet. He's English.

472
00:24:26.133 --> 00:24:27.467
Don't tell me you haven't
heard of him.

473
00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.066
Of course I've heard of him.

474
00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.633
"Nature never did betray
the heart that loved her."

475
00:24:32.767 --> 00:24:33.900
Mick Jagger.

476
00:24:34.033 --> 00:24:35.467
Oh. stop it.

477
00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:38.133
Ah.

478
00:24:39.233 --> 00:24:40.834
So. um.

479
00:24:40.967 --> 00:24:42.400
why here?

480
00:24:42.533 --> 00:24:45.233
Why. on this whole island.
you chose this bit?

481
00:24:45.367 --> 00:24:46.967
This farm?

482
00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.934
Because this is where
my mom grew up.

483
00:24:50.066 --> 00:24:51.667
You're kidding.

484
00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:54.800
No. believe it or not.
my grandparents.

485
00:24:54.934 --> 00:24:56.433
Pat and Colin Penberthy.

486
00:24:56.567 --> 00:24:58.667
are the ones who sold the farm
to your parents.

487
00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.166
That's fascinating.

488
00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.400
We always wanted to come here.
my Mom and I.

489
00:25:03.533 --> 00:25:04.867
Oh. yeah?
Yeah.

490
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.333
We planned on it. um.
but time just...

491
00:25:10.767 --> 00:25:12.033
Ran out.

492
00:25:12.166 --> 00:25:14.000
She passed away last year.

493
00:25:15.166 --> 00:25:16.633
I'm so sorry.

494
00:25:16.767 --> 00:25:18.166
Me too.

495
00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:27.300
You know. having grown up
here myself.

496
00:25:27.433 --> 00:25:30.400
I can say she was a lucky woman.

497
00:25:30.533 --> 00:25:32.433
It's a beautiful place.

498
00:25:37.467 --> 00:25:39.066
Have you been here
your whole life?

499
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.200
No. I went to uni in London.

500
00:25:42.333 --> 00:25:44.867
I did my master's in business.

501
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Actually. I used to work
in global markets.

502
00:25:47.133 --> 00:25:48.800
Futures. mainly.

503
00:25:48.934 --> 00:25:51.300
And you gave all of that up to
come back and work on the land?

504
00:25:51.433 --> 00:25:53.000
How romantic of you.

505
00:25:53.133 --> 00:25:57.967
No. I came back to help my Mum
sort things out.

506
00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:01.533
She won't admit it. but she's
older than she thinks.

507
00:26:01.667 --> 00:26:03.934
And. um. yeah.

508
00:26:04.066 --> 00:26:06.400
Unfortunately. it's more work
than even I can handle.

509
00:26:06.533 --> 00:26:09.133
Well. we should get busy then.

510
00:26:12.266 --> 00:26:15.433
Hey. Gwen.
sorry I missed your call again.

511
00:26:15.567 --> 00:26:18.567
I was out building a rock wall.

512
00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:20.567
I will tell you about it
when we connect.

513
00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:23.934
but until then. tag. you're it.
Okay. bye.

514
00:26:24.066 --> 00:26:26.133
Hi. Is everything okay?

515
00:26:26.266 --> 00:26:30.533
Gran said I have to do some
homework before training today.

516
00:26:30.667 --> 00:26:34.033
and I still might need a little
bit of help if that's okay.

517
00:26:34.166 --> 00:26:35.600
Of course.

518
00:26:35.734 --> 00:26:38.133
It's just a silly short poem.
but every year.

519
00:26:38.266 --> 00:26:40.133
they make the year two kids read
them at the festival.

520
00:26:40.266 --> 00:26:41.767
Mm-hm.

521
00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.767
Have you gotten any feedback yet
from your teacher?

522
00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:47.533
We have to read in front
of the class. so no. not yet.

523
00:26:47.667 --> 00:26:49.066
I asked to go last.

524
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.867
Well. I would be happy
to take a look.

525
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.233
I haven't gotten very far.

526
00:26:53.367 --> 00:26:54.767
That's okay.

527
00:26:56.767 --> 00:26:58.533
But so far. is it right?

528
00:26:58.667 --> 00:27:00.767
There's no right or wrong
in creative writing.

529
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.800
That's what my dad says.

530
00:27:02.934 --> 00:27:04.900
Well. I agree.

531
00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:11.000
Have you tried mind-mapping?

532
00:27:11.133 --> 00:27:12.633
I don't know what that is.

533
00:27:12.767 --> 00:27:14.367
It's a really useful tool.

534
00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:15.800
and I would be so happy
to show you.

535
00:27:15.934 --> 00:27:18.667
Okay.

536
00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.867
But I've got to go to training
now. so maybe tomorrow?

537
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
I'll be here all day. so anytime.

538
00:27:24.133 --> 00:27:25.300
Thank you.

539
00:27:25.433 --> 00:27:27.033
Bye.
Bye.

540
00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.300
Hi. Lily!

541
00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:08.667
Using the family door now.
are we?

542
00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.600
Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't--

543
00:28:11.734 --> 00:28:13.033
No. no. no. don't worry.

544
00:28:13.166 --> 00:28:16.166
You are technically our guest.
I suppose.

545
00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.000
How can I be of service?

546
00:28:18.133 --> 00:28:19.834
Sorry.

547
00:28:19.967 --> 00:28:22.367
Um. thank you. Mrs. Carter.

548
00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.367
Is Daniel back from the field?

549
00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.600
That boy does what he likes
when he likes.

550
00:28:30.734 --> 00:28:32.367
May I ask why?

551
00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:35.100
I. uh. have a question for him.

552
00:28:35.233 --> 00:28:36.667
Is this about your
accommodation?

553
00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.600
I told him people would expect
a fancy resort.

554
00:28:39.734 --> 00:28:41.567
Not a drafty old mill room.

555
00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:43.834
No. it's actually--
it's about Tegan.

556
00:28:43.967 --> 00:28:46.033
You have a question about
my granddaughter?

557
00:28:47.467 --> 00:28:50.533
No. not exactly. I...

558
00:28:50.667 --> 00:28:51.900
Uh...

559
00:28:53.333 --> 00:28:55.500
I found her notebook.

560
00:28:55.633 --> 00:28:57.000
Thank you. Yeah.

561
00:28:57.133 --> 00:28:59.233
I'm sure she'll be quite pleased.

562
00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:01.567
Is that all?

563
00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:03.300
Oh. that's all. yes.

564
00:29:03.433 --> 00:29:04.600
Very well.

565
00:29:04.734 --> 00:29:05.967
Okay.

566
00:30:03.467 --> 00:30:05.367
Joss:
Daniel?

567
00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:07.633
Daniel! Good morning.

568
00:30:07.767 --> 00:30:09.567
Wasn't expecting to see you out
this early morning.

569
00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:11.633
Doing some early morning
procrastination?

570
00:30:13.333 --> 00:30:15.667
I actually wanted
to ask you something.

571
00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:19.066
Has Tegan been struggling with
reading and writing for awhile?

572
00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.900
What makes you say that?

573
00:30:21.033 --> 00:30:22.633
She asked me for some help
with a poem.

574
00:30:22.767 --> 00:30:24.166
She shouldn't have been
bothering you. I'm sorry.

575
00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:27.166
Oh. no. I offered.
But I noticed her notebook.

576
00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:28.800
and I saw something that
concerned me.

577
00:30:28.934 --> 00:30:30.333
Concerned you how?

578
00:30:30.467 --> 00:30:33.500
I think she may be showing signs
of dyslexia.

579
00:30:33.633 --> 00:30:37.066
Has her teacher mentioned
anything?

580
00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.700
Uh. just that she might need
some extra help reading.

581
00:30:39.834 --> 00:30:42.200
Um... she's had a tough time
with the move.

582
00:30:42.333 --> 00:30:44.800
she's fallen behind
a little bit.

583
00:30:44.934 --> 00:30:46.734
She's had to put up with more
than her fair share in life.

584
00:30:46.867 --> 00:30:49.800
but she's smart.
she makes great art.

585
00:30:49.934 --> 00:30:52.700
That makes sense. 'cause most
people with dyslexia.

586
00:30:52.834 --> 00:30:54.200
they're highly intelligent.

587
00:30:54.333 --> 00:30:56.066
Because they excel in
other areas.

588
00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.867
it can be really hard to spot.

589
00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.500
My Mom had it.

590
00:30:59.633 --> 00:31:01.066
She struggled a lot
when she was a kid.

591
00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.166
but she learned how
to manage it.

592
00:31:05.533 --> 00:31:07.033
Look. I'm sorry to hear
about your mother.

593
00:31:07.166 --> 00:31:08.900
but I think you're making
a bit of a leap here.

594
00:31:09.033 --> 00:31:10.567
I know this is overwhelming.

595
00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:13.233
but there's people who
specialize in this.

596
00:31:13.367 --> 00:31:16.300
And I would also be happy
to help.

597
00:31:16.433 --> 00:31:18.667
Uh. thanks. but we're sorted.

598
00:31:21.934 --> 00:31:23.400
Samson. come here.

599
00:31:32.433 --> 00:31:34.266
Come on.
Come on. you.

600
00:31:39.567 --> 00:31:41.367
That's beautiful. Tegan.

601
00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:42.934
What's it called?

602
00:31:43.066 --> 00:31:45.200
It's called Sampson the Mighty.

603
00:31:45.333 --> 00:31:47.533
Perfect.

604
00:31:47.667 --> 00:31:50.633
Why don't you write it up here
at the top?

605
00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:56.567
Well. it's you're choice.

606
00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:58.633
you're the artist.

607
00:32:05.633 --> 00:32:07.467
Be back in a mo'.

608
00:32:15.467 --> 00:32:18.133
Well. what do you think?

609
00:32:18.266 --> 00:32:23.066
I think the professor is poking
her nose in where she shouldn't.

610
00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:26.200
What if she's right?

611
00:32:26.333 --> 00:32:28.800
Maybe I should take her to the
doctor to at least rule it out.

612
00:32:28.934 --> 00:32:30.967
Oh. this is the last thing
she needs.

613
00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:32.367
What is that supposed to mean?

614
00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.633
She's already drawn
a short straw.

615
00:32:35.767 --> 00:32:38.467
What kind of mother leaves
her child?

616
00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.767
I warned you about Catherine.
from very the beginning.

617
00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:42.967
that she was no good for you.
But you wouldn't listen.

618
00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:46.900
Do you want to rehash my failed
marriage or talk about Tegan?

619
00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:12.066
We're going to
tuck in Polly.

620
00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.700
and we're going to
tuck in Laney.

621
00:33:13.834 --> 00:33:15.333
and we're going to
tuck in Dougie.

622
00:33:15.467 --> 00:33:16.567
Good night.
good night. good night!

623
00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:18.567
And you. There we go.

624
00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:20.767
Hey.

625
00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:24.000
Why didn't you tell me
that you were struggling?

626
00:33:24.133 --> 00:33:26.433
I didn't want you to worry.

627
00:33:26.567 --> 00:33:28.100
I'm not worried.

628
00:33:28.233 --> 00:33:30.000
Is this the face of
a worried man?

629
00:33:30.133 --> 00:33:31.433
Hmm?

630
00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.266
You know you can tell me anything.

631
00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.333
We're a team. right?

632
00:33:36.467 --> 00:33:38.266
Okay. Dad.

633
00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:41.133
Is Joss going to help me
with my poem?

634
00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:45.066
Uh. Joss is a guest so we
shouldn't be bothering her.

635
00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.266
But I'm going to talk
to your teacher

636
00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.367
and we're going to get
everything sorted out at school.

637
00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:50.934
Make a plan. yeah?

638
00:33:51.066 --> 00:33:54.867
Okay. I just like talking
to her. she's nice.

639
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.700
Yeah. she is nice.

640
00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:00.834
Um. sleep tight.

641
00:34:00.967 --> 00:34:02.166
Don't tickle me!

642
00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:03.700
I wouldn't dare.

643
00:34:05.734 --> 00:34:07.533
Okay. Ah.

644
00:34:09.734 --> 00:34:11.033
Does it go away?

645
00:34:13.133 --> 00:34:15.066
Does what? Dyslexia?

646
00:34:19.033 --> 00:34:20.400
No. it doesn't go away.

647
00:34:20.533 --> 00:34:22.133
but there's loads that we can do

648
00:34:22.266 --> 00:34:24.400
to make sure it gets
a lot better. all right?

649
00:34:24.533 --> 00:34:26.066
Okay.

650
00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:29.000
Yeah. I love you.

651
00:34:29.133 --> 00:34:31.066
I love you too.

652
00:35:00.767 --> 00:35:02.934
Tegan hasn't made many
connections since we got here.

653
00:35:04.967 --> 00:35:06.867
But she really likes you.

654
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.200
You know. I don't know
what we're dealing with exactly.

655
00:35:11.333 --> 00:35:15.233
but... I want to help
however we can.

656
00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:19.900
So. if your offer still stands?

657
00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:25.667
Of course.

658
00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:31.900
Goodnight. then.

659
00:35:32.033 --> 00:35:33.266
Goodnight.

660
00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.133
I love what you're saying here.

661
00:35:46.266 --> 00:35:47.467
About the river?

662
00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:48.934
Yeah. about how
it makes you happy.

663
00:35:49.066 --> 00:35:50.467
Do you want to try
reading the mind map.

664
00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.767
see how it sounds to you?
Let's start here. okay?

665
00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:56.533
I ran to the river.

666
00:35:56.667 --> 00:35:58.266
Good. good. Keep going.

667
00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:00.767
I can't remember
what comes next.

668
00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:04.300
Well. whatever you want
to be next is next.

669
00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:09.900
Do you know what I do
when I get stuck?

670
00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:14.266
I sing.

671
00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:15.367
Okay. not well.

672
00:36:16.934 --> 00:36:18.500
But it helps me find
the rhythm in the words.

673
00:36:18.633 --> 00:36:20.433
so I try to sing the poems.

674
00:36:20.567 --> 00:36:22.166
and sometimes...

675
00:36:23.734 --> 00:36:24.834
I dance them.

676
00:36:24.967 --> 00:36:26.533
Are you serious?

677
00:36:26.667 --> 00:36:29.433
Yeah. of course. it helps
the words just flow out of you.

678
00:36:29.567 --> 00:36:31.500
Do you want to see?

679
00:36:31.633 --> 00:36:34.066

697

Writing doesn't have
to all be hard work.

698
00:37:19.533 --> 00:37:21.333
It should be fun. too.

699
00:37:21.467 --> 00:37:23.367
Danny:
Says the woman who would
rather mend a granite wall

700
00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:25.667
than write her paper.

701
00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.333
Sorry. I didn't mean
to break it up.

702
00:37:28.467 --> 00:37:30.533
Oh. no. That's alright I think
we're almost done for the day.

703
00:37:30.667 --> 00:37:32.166
Don't you think. Tegan?

704
00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:35.834
Besides. I should get back
to writing my own paper.

705
00:37:35.967 --> 00:37:38.066
I'm still quite stuck actually.

706
00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:39.600
Did you try dancing?

707
00:37:39.734 --> 00:37:41.200
You know. I'm not sure
that would work for

708
00:37:41.333 --> 00:37:44.166
the research paper.
but I should try it. huh?

709
00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:45.567
What you need is a pasty.

710
00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:47.400
Yes!

711
00:37:47.533 --> 00:37:48.834
Actually. Felix and his wife
Isabelle are taking

712
00:37:48.967 --> 00:37:50.433
their daughter Lily
to the harbor head.

713
00:37:50.567 --> 00:37:51.934
and the puppet show.
We're gonna get pasties after.

714
00:37:52.066 --> 00:37:53.300
You should come along.

715
00:37:55.367 --> 00:37:56.500
Yes! You must.

716
00:37:56.633 --> 00:37:58.233
I really shouldn't.

717
00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:03.900
But maybe a change of
scenery would do me good.

718
00:38:04.033 --> 00:38:05.467
I would only stay
for an hour. though.

719
00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:06.500
We'll take it.

720
00:38:06.633 --> 00:38:08.767
Alright.

721
00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:11.266
Okay. but what is a pasty?

722
00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:12.700
Oh. well. let me tell you.

723
00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:32.433
Behind you! Behind you!

724
00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:48.734
Felix:
Lovely to see you again. Joss.

725
00:38:48.867 --> 00:38:50.333
How are you enjoying Cornwall?

726
00:38:50.467 --> 00:38:52.333
It's beautiful so far from
what I've seen at least.

727
00:38:52.467 --> 00:38:53.734
Surviving Mrs. Carter I presume?

728
00:38:53.867 --> 00:38:55.433
Easy!

729
00:38:55.567 --> 00:38:56.667
Fell free to ignore him.

730
00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:57.967
I'm Isabelle.
Oh. hi.

731
00:38:58.100 --> 00:38:59.734
Felix's incredibly
tolerant wife.

732
00:38:59.867 --> 00:39:01.567
Nice to meet you.

733
00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:03.467
Isabelle runs the marketing
for the literary festival.

734
00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:05.300
Oh. let's hope
you've heard of it.

735
00:39:05.433 --> 00:39:08.567
Of course. my mom grew up here.
she used to go to it as a child.

736
00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:10.133
Is that so?

737
00:39:10.266 --> 00:39:11.367
Yeah. she even
volunteered for the festival

738
00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:12.467
when she was in her 20s.

739
00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:14.066
Did she ever submit?

740
00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:15.533
Not original work.

741
00:39:15.667 --> 00:39:16.800
She wasn't much of
a writer herself.

742
00:39:16.934 --> 00:39:18.900
but she did
memorize all the greats

743
00:39:19.033 --> 00:39:21.300
and she would recite one
at the final event.

744
00:39:21.433 --> 00:39:23.834
Oh. how lovely.
What's her name?

745
00:39:23.967 --> 00:39:25.400
I bet my mother
will remember her.

746
00:39:25.533 --> 00:39:26.867
She remembers everything else.
Oh. shush.

747
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.066
Carol Lambert.

748
00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.567
Well. Carol Penberthy
was her maiden name.

749
00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:34.000
That sounds familiar.
but I'll ask her.

750
00:39:34.133 --> 00:39:36.367
Joss is a professor
of romantic literature.

751
00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:37.633
So. connection.

752
00:39:37.767 --> 00:39:39.633
That's brilliant.
Romantic eh?

753
00:39:39.767 --> 00:39:42.667
Danny boy over here is
a hopeless romantic himself.

754
00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.400
Aren't you?
That so?

755
00:39:46.133 --> 00:39:47.700
I never answer such
questions on an empty tummy.

756
00:39:47.834 --> 00:39:50.300
Well. Ashton's mum is
taking the girls for ice cream.

757
00:39:50.433 --> 00:39:52.667
Right. well. that just
means one thing. doesn't it?

758
00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.233
To the pub. Come on.

759
00:39:56.266 --> 00:40:00.233
How do they even think of this?
This is. like. genius.

760
00:40:00.367 --> 00:40:02.000
The tin miners used to take
this down the mines with them.

761
00:40:02.133 --> 00:40:03.233
and they would
never eat the crusts

762
00:40:03.367 --> 00:40:04.800
because their hands were dirty.

763
00:40:04.934 --> 00:40:06.200
I never knew that.
Is that real?

764
00:40:06.333 --> 00:40:07.567
So what's the verdict?

765
00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:09.233
Traditional or veg?

766
00:40:09.367 --> 00:40:10.667
Traditional. definitely.

767
00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:11.700
Danny:
All your meat
and veg in one bite.

768
00:40:11.834 --> 00:40:13.433
How can you go wrong?

769
00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:17.200
Hey. are we still on for Monday?

770
00:40:17.333 --> 00:40:18.867
Danny:
The surveyor? Yeah.

771
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.400
Must we talk business?
We're having such a good time.

772
00:40:21.533 --> 00:40:23.333
You don't have to decide yet.
but we will need to know how

773
00:40:23.467 --> 00:40:25.066
much. you know.
land you'll have to swap out

774
00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.166
if you decide to go that way.

775
00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:28.166
Who wants another beer?

776
00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:29.567
Yeah.
I will. yeah.

777
00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:31.033
I should actually. um--
I should get going.

778
00:40:31.166 --> 00:40:32.700
I've just--
I've slacked off enough.

779
00:40:32.834 --> 00:40:33.967
Yeah. we can go.

780
00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:35.834
Oh. no. That's okay. You stay.

781
00:40:35.967 --> 00:40:37.867
Have fun. I can walk by myself.

782
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.300
Just point me in
the right direction.

783
00:40:39.433 --> 00:40:42.133
Okay. em. we came
the more direct route.

784
00:40:42.266 --> 00:40:43.567
If you want
a more scenic version.

785
00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:46.400
then just turn left.
and you can't miss it.

786
00:40:46.533 --> 00:40:48.867
It's very easy to do.

787
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.333
Okay. Thank you.

788
00:40:52.467 --> 00:40:53.367
Bye.
Bye.

789
00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:55.400
Hey. Joss.

790
00:40:55.533 --> 00:40:59.633
Um... Thank you
for today with Tegan.

791
00:40:59.767 --> 00:41:02.600
Of course.
We can do more. too.

792
00:41:02.734 --> 00:41:03.600
You sure you don't want to stay?

793
00:41:03.734 --> 00:41:05.066
Next round's on Felix.

794
00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.767
I think I should just get back.

795
00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:09.033
Right.

796
00:41:09.166 --> 00:41:11.200
Or left. it's prettier.

797
00:41:23.567 --> 00:41:26.767
Gwen:
It looks like there's four
candidates in the running now.

798
00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:30.400
Four. how am I supposed
to compete with four?

799
00:41:30.533 --> 00:41:33.633
I didn't mean to worry you.
I just thought you should know.

800
00:41:33.767 --> 00:41:35.233
What am I going to do?

801
00:41:35.367 --> 00:41:37.066
I only have a week to
make this what they want.

802
00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.300
The paper?

803
00:41:38.433 --> 00:41:40.400
Your research is impeccable.

804
00:41:40.533 --> 00:41:42.300
I'm sure it just
needs a good edit.

805
00:41:42.433 --> 00:41:43.600
You'll figure it out.

806
00:41:43.734 --> 00:41:45.734
But what if I don't?
What if I can't?

807
00:41:45.867 --> 00:41:48.367
Joss. I know how much
this means to you.

808
00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:51.233
and. honestly.
you're the best teacher I have.

809
00:41:51.367 --> 00:41:53.200
I don't want to lose you.

810
00:41:53.333 --> 00:41:56.767
One step at a time.
Get the paper in.

811
00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:58.867
When you get back.
we'll talk about what else

812
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.934
you can do to
impress the board. okay?

813
00:42:03.066 --> 00:42:04.934
Okay.

814
00:42:05.066 --> 00:42:06.166
We'll talk soon.

815
00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:56.467
This will pass.

816
00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:03.400
"And in life's noisiest hour.
there whispers still

817
00:43:03.533 --> 00:43:05.400
the ceaseless love of thee.

818
00:43:05.533 --> 00:43:08.033
the heart's self-solace
and soliloquy."

819
00:43:35.433 --> 00:43:36.800
Promise you. Alex.
Best surveyor in the country.

820
00:43:36.934 --> 00:43:38.066
So. what does he think?

821
00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:40.166
A good 40%. at least.

822
00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:42.166
You know. to allow for
the number of wind turbines

823
00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:45.066
to satisfy the contract.
but once they're in...

824
00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:46.333
They take care of themselves?

825
00:43:46.467 --> 00:43:48.333
Guaranteed income.

826
00:43:48.467 --> 00:43:49.967
As long as the wind blows.

827
00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:52.600
and in Cornwall.
she always blows.

828
00:43:52.734 --> 00:43:53.834
Alright. so what else
do you need from me?

829
00:43:53.967 --> 00:43:56.700
Nothing much. just an answer.

830
00:43:58.233 --> 00:44:00.333
End of week?

831
00:44:00.467 --> 00:44:01.700
Yeah.

832
00:44:03.667 --> 00:44:06.133
Alex!

833
00:44:06.266 --> 00:44:08.000
Looks like
you're already coming. great.

834
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.333
How you been standing there?

835
00:44:15.467 --> 00:44:17.233
Long enough.

836
00:44:17.367 --> 00:44:19.000
Mum! Let's talk about this.

837
00:44:19.133 --> 00:44:21.367
Why? You seem to have made up
your mind for both of us.

838
00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:22.834
We agreed that
I would take over the farm.

839
00:44:22.967 --> 00:44:25.333
To preserve it.
not carve it up.

840
00:44:25.467 --> 00:44:26.734
You don't understand
what I'm dealing with.

841
00:44:26.867 --> 00:44:28.533
If it's too much for you.
hire some hands.

842
00:44:28.667 --> 00:44:30.467
It's not that simple.

843
00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:31.867
The markets are changing.

844
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.333
England is changing.
the whole world in fact.

845
00:44:33.467 --> 00:44:35.700
We can't keep
holding on to the past.

846
00:44:35.834 --> 00:44:37.567
I agreed to
the bed and breakfast.

847
00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:38.700
Isn't that enough for you?

848
00:44:38.834 --> 00:44:40.533
No.

849
00:44:40.667 --> 00:44:42.900
I'm doing everything I can.

850
00:44:43.033 --> 00:44:45.867
I promise you.
I won't make a final decision

851
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.133
without your approval.

852
00:44:47.266 --> 00:44:49.066
Good.

853
00:44:51.367 --> 00:44:54.000
I'm going to the cove.
Will you watch Tegan?

854
00:45:13.767 --> 00:45:15.133
Be right there.

855
00:45:19.266 --> 00:45:20.433
Are you busy at the moment?

856
00:45:20.567 --> 00:45:21.967
No. Not at the minute. no.

857
00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:23.367
Come on a drive with me.

858
00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:27.567
Oh. I actually--
I'm not busy right now

859
00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:30.200
but I really should
be getting back to it.

860
00:45:30.333 --> 00:45:34.567
I just--
I'm so behind and so uninspired.

861
00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:37.200
What was that line
from the Wordsworth poem?

862
00:45:37.333 --> 00:45:39.900
He wrote a lot. which one?

863
00:45:40.033 --> 00:45:41.600
The one you quoted me.

864
00:45:41.734 --> 00:45:45.100
Ah. "Nature never did betray
the heart that loved her."

865
00:45:45.233 --> 00:45:46.734
That's the one.

866
00:45:46.867 --> 00:45:48.467
What don't we get
you out to nature?

867
00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:52.433
I tried that yesterday
and she wasn't very hospitable.

868
00:45:52.567 --> 00:45:55.200
Doesn't sound like her.

869
00:45:55.333 --> 00:45:56.767
Maybe you need
a proper introduction.

870
00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:59.300
You mean like a wingman?

871
00:45:59.433 --> 00:46:00.867
I don't know what that means.
but if you'll come with me.

872
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.233
them yes.

873
00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:07.133
To be honest.
I could use the company.

874
00:46:07.266 --> 00:46:08.867
Feeling a bit
unmoored at the moment.

875
00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:13.166
I'll let you sit in the front.

876
00:46:15.066 --> 00:46:16.867
Must get my coat.

877
00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:25.000
Danny:
I'm feeling pretty
lucky that I peeled you

878
00:46:25.133 --> 00:46:27.000
away from that paper.

879
00:46:27.133 --> 00:46:28.333
Joss:
Please. don't remind me.

880
00:46:28.467 --> 00:46:29.967
I'm having enough
guilt as it is.

881
00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:32.800
Danny:
My apologies.
It's just up this way.

882
00:46:32.934 --> 00:46:34.333
Joss:
Wait a minute.
I recognize this place

883
00:46:34.467 --> 00:46:35.800
from my mom's old home videos.

884
00:46:35.934 --> 00:46:37.333
Danny:
Really?

885
00:46:37.467 --> 00:46:39.066
Joss:
She used to talk
about this all the time.

886
00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:45.033
She would climb to the clifftop
and sit there for hours

887
00:46:45.166 --> 00:46:48.200
when she was young. just waiting
for the sunset. reading.

888
00:46:48.333 --> 00:46:50.633
Taking pictures.
It was calming for her.

889
00:46:50.767 --> 00:46:52.500
Yeah. we do have proper sunsets.

890
00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:06.533
Okay. it's just
a little bit further.

891
00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:16.934
It doesn't really look safe.

892
00:47:21.533 --> 00:47:23.100
Danny:
You coming?

893
00:47:23.233 --> 00:47:26.633
Joss:
This will pass.
It's okay. This will pass.

894
00:47:28.567 --> 00:47:29.867
You alright?

895
00:47:31.467 --> 00:47:32.433
Get the paper in.

896
00:47:32.567 --> 00:47:33.567
But what if I don't?

897
00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:34.934
It's okay. This will pass.

898
00:47:35.066 --> 00:47:36.000
Almost there.

899
00:47:36.133 --> 00:47:37.700
I can't.

900
00:47:37.834 --> 00:47:39.000
Of course you can.

901
00:47:39.133 --> 00:47:40.233
You got this.
Just down the path.

902
00:47:40.367 --> 00:47:42.200
No. I can't.

903
00:47:42.333 --> 00:47:43.934
Okay. we'll turn back.

904
00:47:48.967 --> 00:47:51.400
Sorry about that back there.

905
00:47:51.533 --> 00:47:53.767
Nothing to be sorry about.
It's my fault for pushing you.

906
00:47:55.233 --> 00:47:58.200
I've been dealing with them.
anxiety attacks.

907
00:47:58.333 --> 00:47:59.767
since I was young.

908
00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:01.967
How young?

909
00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:03.934
They started when I was nine.

910
00:48:04.066 --> 00:48:07.667
I was in a car accident
with my dad. He died.

911
00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:09.767
I'm so sorry.

912
00:48:11.233 --> 00:48:13.066
I was always
a reserved kid before.

913
00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.500
but afterwards the fear just...

914
00:48:17.734 --> 00:48:21.100
Just took root
and never left.

915
00:48:23.633 --> 00:48:27.834
Mom always encouraged me to
push past it. take some risks.

916
00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:32.400
She actually still is.

917
00:48:32.533 --> 00:48:35.233
This whole trip is
a birthday present from her.

918
00:48:35.367 --> 00:48:36.600
When was your birthday?

919
00:48:36.734 --> 00:48:39.166
It's coming up.
it's on Saturday.

920
00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:41.166
Oh. great! Any fun plans?

921
00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:45.300
Well. at the moment.
quietly contemplating the course

922
00:48:45.433 --> 00:48:47.800
of my life.
whether it was a mistake

923
00:48:47.934 --> 00:48:49.400
to come here when I should be

924
00:48:49.533 --> 00:48:51.567
focused on
my professional goals.

925
00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:53.600
Is that before
or after the cake?

926
00:48:57.734 --> 00:49:00.567
Here. this is what
I wanted to show you.

927
00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:17.967
Why does this make me so happy?

928
00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:19.867
I know you're a book worm.

929
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.700
but you really take it to
the next metamorphosis.

930
00:49:23.834 --> 00:49:26.333
What would that be?
A book butterfly?

931
00:49:26.467 --> 00:49:30.367
If you're calling me a nerd.
I'm totally okay with that.

932
00:49:32.867 --> 00:49:36.200
Oh. I love this quote
by Oscar Wilde.

933
00:49:36.333 --> 00:49:37.967
"It's what you read
when you don't have to.

934
00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:40.667
that determines who you will
be when you can't help it."

935
00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:42.633
For those of us without
a degree in English literature.

936
00:49:42.767 --> 00:49:44.033
what does that mean?

937
00:49:45.967 --> 00:49:48.000
What you choose to
fill your mind with...

938
00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:52.834
...has a huge impact on
who you are as a person.

939
00:49:52.967 --> 00:49:54.300
So. you are what you read.

940
00:49:54.433 --> 00:49:55.667
Essentially.

941
00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:56.900
That is a scary thought.

942
00:49:57.033 --> 00:49:58.700
Which way is
the comic book section?

943
00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:03.633
I'm going to get us a table
at my favorite little cafe.

944
00:50:03.767 --> 00:50:06.066
Why don't you find yourself
a birthday gift from me?

945
00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:07.367
You don't have to do that.

946
00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:09.300
I know. but I'm English.

947
00:50:09.433 --> 00:50:10.834
being a gentleman
comes naturally.

948
00:50:13.033 --> 00:50:13.900
Cashier:
Thank you.

949
00:50:27.867 --> 00:50:29.533
Gran! I scored a--

950
00:50:29.667 --> 00:50:31.400
No boots in the house. dear.

951
00:50:31.533 --> 00:50:33.100
Door!

952
00:50:35.133 --> 00:50:36.233
That's my girl.

953
00:50:36.367 --> 00:50:39.166
Now what were you saying?

954
00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:41.200
I scored a goal
at training today.

955
00:50:41.333 --> 00:50:42.500
That's wonderful!

956
00:50:42.633 --> 00:50:44.467
Where's dad? I want to tell him.

957
00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:45.734
Your father is
out at the moment.

958
00:50:45.867 --> 00:50:47.200
That's okay.
I can tell Joss then.

959
00:50:47.333 --> 00:50:50.633
I'm afraid he's out with Joss.

960
00:50:50.767 --> 00:50:52.066
I believe he's driven
her to the cove.

961
00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:53.066
I'm sorry. dear.

962
00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:54.734
That's okay. I like Joss.

963
00:50:54.867 --> 00:50:56.400
Do you?

964
00:50:56.533 --> 00:50:58.233
Daddy does. too. I can tell.

965
00:50:58.367 --> 00:50:59.367
Is that so?

966
00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:01.200
I don't know if he fancies her.

967
00:51:01.333 --> 00:51:02.567
but he definitely likes her.

968
00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:04.066
What do you think?

969
00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:08.233
I assure you.
I don't know what to think.

970
00:51:08.367 --> 00:51:10.967
Off you go. To the bathroom.

971
00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:13.133
I don't want you stinking
at the dinner table.

972
00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:23.967
I am so excited to read this

973
00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:25.800
as soon as I get
a chance to pleasure read.

974
00:51:25.934 --> 00:51:27.033
Thank you.

975
00:51:27.166 --> 00:51:28.500
My pleasure. More tea?

976
00:51:28.633 --> 00:51:30.500
As long as you don't
have to get back.

977
00:51:30.633 --> 00:51:32.467
Soon. but I'm lucky.

978
00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:34.700
My mother makes an amazing gran.

979
00:51:34.834 --> 00:51:37.834
We've become quite
the team raising my daughter.

980
00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:40.667
Tegan mentioned
it's just the two of you.

981
00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.100
Must be hard.

982
00:51:42.233 --> 00:51:45.367
Is that your clever way
of asking if I'm single?

983
00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:47.600
It wasn't.

984
00:51:47.734 --> 00:51:50.433
but now that you mention it.

985
00:51:50.567 --> 00:51:53.367
I am.
and have been for a long time.

986
00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:56.867
Catherine. and I met in London.

987
00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.367
We got married
right after graduation.

988
00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:01.600
against our parents' wishes.

989
00:52:01.734 --> 00:52:04.533
I was in business school
when Tegan was born.

990
00:52:04.667 --> 00:52:08.433
And things changed quickly.

991
00:52:08.567 --> 00:52:12.700
Her parents cut her off.
and we started arguing.

992
00:52:12.834 --> 00:52:14.433
A lot.

993
00:52:14.567 --> 00:52:15.800
It was difficult.

994
00:52:18.066 --> 00:52:22.867
One day. I came home after class
and Tegan was with a babysitter.

995
00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:26.433
I never saw her again.

996
00:52:28.033 --> 00:52:29.667
She just left?

997
00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:34.200
She left a note saying that
it had gotten too much for her.

998
00:52:38.166 --> 00:52:40.266
And. um...

999
00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:42.166
Tegan doesn't remember.
though. luckily.

1000
00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:44.266
In her mind.
it's just been the two of us.

1001
00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:46.867
I'm so sorry.

1002
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.367
Don't be.

1003
00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:50.567
It's in the past.

1004
00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:51.967
Where it belongs.

1005
00:52:55.734 --> 00:52:57.867
You have an uncanny ability
to live in the present.

1006
00:52:59.467 --> 00:53:02.400
I'm always going over
what happened in the past

1007
00:53:02.533 --> 00:53:05.066
and worrying about what's
going to happen in the future.

1008
00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:07.633
Life's too short to
deal with all that stress.

1009
00:53:07.767 --> 00:53:09.100
All we can do is
deal with the problems

1010
00:53:09.233 --> 00:53:10.767
right in front of us

1011
00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:12.600
and choose what
brings us the most joy.

1012
00:53:12.734 --> 00:53:14.500
That's beautiful.

1013
00:53:14.633 --> 00:53:16.000
It's a Carter original.

1014
00:53:16.133 --> 00:53:17.800
I thought so.

1015
00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:25.467
Are you okay?

1016
00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:30.400
All this talk about
"joy" and "reading"

1017
00:53:30.533 --> 00:53:32.100
has me worried
about my Tegan.

1018
00:53:33.266 --> 00:53:35.066
She's going to be alright.

1019
00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:37.967
I have a meeting
coming up with her teacher.

1020
00:53:39.533 --> 00:53:42.333
Could I trouble you to join me?

1021
00:53:42.467 --> 00:53:44.066
You make me feel
much more comfortable.

1022
00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:45.967
Of course.

1023
00:53:48.467 --> 00:53:49.767
Of course.

1024
00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:55.066
Today we're going to try
something a little different.

1025
00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:57.100
Alright. I'm going to
read you the words

1026
00:53:57.233 --> 00:53:59.433
to one of my very
favorite Wordsworth poems

1027
00:53:59.567 --> 00:54:01.233
What's a Wordsworth poem?

1028
00:54:01.367 --> 00:54:05.867
Well. Wordsworth was a man
who wrote spectacular poetry.

1029
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.567
So. you're going to
listen to the words.

1030
00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:10.533
and then you're going
to write the words.

1031
00:54:10.667 --> 00:54:12.300
but with pictures.

1032
00:54:12.433 --> 00:54:13.700
Sounds hard.

1033
00:54:13.834 --> 00:54:16.033
Sure. but it's good
to have a challenge.

1034
00:54:16.166 --> 00:54:18.300
you know.
like in soccer practice.

1035
00:54:18.433 --> 00:54:20.166
You mean football?

1036
00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:22.667
Yes. Yes. I mean football.

1037
00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:24.166
Okay. should we try it?

1038
00:54:25.633 --> 00:54:29.133
Here's your pencils. Alright.

1039
00:54:29.266 --> 00:54:32.033
I wandered lonely as a cloud.

1040
00:54:32.166 --> 00:54:33.600
That one's easy.

1041
00:54:36.533 --> 00:54:39.000
That floats on high
o'er vales and hills.

1042
00:54:39.133 --> 00:54:40.233
What's a vale?

1043
00:54:40.367 --> 00:54:41.400
It's a valley.

1044
00:54:45.934 --> 00:54:47.633
When all at once I saw a crowd.

1045
00:54:47.767 --> 00:54:50.467
a host of golden daffodils.

1046
00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:53.400
Slow down!
I can't draw that fast!

1047
00:54:53.533 --> 00:54:56.000
It's alright. Just try not to
be intimidated by the words.

1048
00:54:56.133 --> 00:54:58.967
listen to them and think
about how they make you feel.

1049
00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:00.533
what they remind you of.

1050
00:55:00.667 --> 00:55:02.900
Think about the lyrics
to your favorite song.

1051
00:55:03.033 --> 00:55:04.367
The lyrics don't
always make sense.

1052
00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:06.700
but they feel right.

1053
00:55:06.834 --> 00:55:07.967
Alright. keep going.

1054
00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:11.266
Beside the lake.
beneath the trees.

1055
00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:14.600
fluttering and dancing
in the breeze.

1056
00:55:14.734 --> 00:55:17.633
Continuous as
the stars that shine

1057
00:55:17.767 --> 00:55:20.600
and twinkle on the milky way.

1058
00:55:20.734 --> 00:55:24.233
they stretched
in never-ending line

1059
00:55:24.367 --> 00:55:27.200
along the margin of a bay.

1060
00:55:27.333 --> 00:55:31.400
Ten-thousand saw I at a glance.

1061
00:55:31.533 --> 00:55:35.100
tossing their heads
in sprightly dance.

1062
00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:44.934
Joss:
Her symptoms were subtle.

1063
00:55:45.066 --> 00:55:47.133
I wouldn't have noticed
if I hadn't seen it before.

1064
00:55:47.266 --> 00:55:49.433
I appreciate your notes.
Dr. Lambert.

1065
00:55:49.567 --> 00:55:51.867
Of course we will need to
get a full evaluation done.

1066
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.567
starting with our
occupational therapist.

1067
00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:57.300
I did see signs. I just...

1068
00:55:59.066 --> 00:56:01.300
I thought she was adjusting
to her new life here.

1069
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.467
I thought it was a phase.

1070
00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:06.967
It's difficult to fully
diagnose it unless you know

1071
00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:10.033
what you're looking for.
but early intervention is key.

1072
00:56:10.166 --> 00:56:12.800
Yeah. I just don't
want her to be labeled.

1073
00:56:12.934 --> 00:56:14.667
That isn't going to happen here.

1074
00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:18.633
Mr. Carter. it doesn't do us any
good being hard on ourselves.

1075
00:56:20.166 --> 00:56:21.367
We are only responsible
for how we handle this

1076
00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:22.734
with Tegan moving forward.

1077
00:56:24.767 --> 00:56:26.000
What do we do
about the festival?

1078
00:56:26.133 --> 00:56:28.367
That is completely up to Tegan.

1079
00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:30.367
If she wants to
read her poem. great.

1080
00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:32.033
Or she can read
something else she likes.

1081
00:56:32.166 --> 00:56:33.300
Or. nothing at all.

1082
00:56:33.433 --> 00:56:35.033
That's okay too.

1083
00:56:35.166 --> 00:56:36.500
She can lead
the charge on this one.

1084
00:56:38.667 --> 00:56:41.500
There are no labels here.
Only support.

1085
00:57:07.867 --> 00:57:10.166
Merryn:
You should've just
left it up to the teacher.

1086
00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:13.066
I did.
Joss was only there to help.

1087
00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:15.433
You shouldn't involve her
any more than you have.

1088
00:57:15.567 --> 00:57:17.033
It was the right move.

1089
00:57:17.166 --> 00:57:19.934
Everything is always a brilliant
idea with you. isn't it?

1090
00:57:20.066 --> 00:57:21.700
Until it's not.

1091
00:57:21.834 --> 00:57:23.166
Excuse me?

1092
00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:26.233
You always lead
with your heart

1093
00:57:26.367 --> 00:57:28.166
at the expense of
everyone around you.

1094
00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:30.166
Are we done here?

1095
00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:32.567
Doesn't look like you are.

1096
00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:34.600
I've seen your plans.

1097
00:57:34.734 --> 00:57:36.166
You look through my things?

1098
00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:38.166
You left them out.

1099
00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:40.367
Were you going to
talk to me about this

1100
00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:42.667
or just leave me to
wake up to the apocalypse?

1101
00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:44.500
Nothing has been decided yet.

1102
00:57:44.633 --> 00:57:48.100
The how do you explain this
perfect little map of yours?

1103
00:57:51.133 --> 00:57:52.233
It's all planned out is it?

1104
00:57:52.367 --> 00:57:53.233
Just my thoughts
on where they should go.

1105
00:57:53.367 --> 00:57:54.900
I don't want to hear it.

1106
00:57:55.033 --> 00:57:57.567
You promised me.

1107
00:57:57.700 --> 00:58:00.333
Imagine how your father
would feel if he knew this is

1108
00:58:00.467 --> 00:58:02.133
what you were going to do to
his farm when you took over.

1109
00:58:02.266 --> 00:58:06.500
And imagine how your mother will
feel when she watches her son

1110
00:58:06.633 --> 00:58:10.800
give his heart away to another
woman who is bound to leave.

1111
00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:20.467
Joss:
And then he let me pick out

1112
00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:22.066
a book for my birthday.
Okay. I think I'm done.

1113
00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:23.166
With what?

1114
00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:24.734
Living vicariously through you.

1115
00:58:24.867 --> 00:58:26.000
I want to browse old books

1116
00:58:26.133 --> 00:58:28.567
with an Englishman. No fair.

1117
00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:30.166
So. he's cute?

1118
00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:32.333
It doesn't matter
because he lives in England.

1119
00:58:32.467 --> 00:58:34.734
and I'm leaving on Sunday.

1120
00:58:34.867 --> 00:58:36.467
Still could be fun.

1121
00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:38.567
You know what would be fun
is if you got on the redeye.

1122
00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:40.166
and you came
and met me at the festival.

1123
00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:41.400
That'd be fun.

1124
00:58:41.533 --> 00:58:42.500
I wish.

1125
00:58:42.633 --> 00:58:44.734
You know I wish.

1126
00:58:44.867 --> 00:58:46.233
Did you get your paper in?

1127
00:58:46.367 --> 00:58:50.066
Nope. nope. nope. No. I did not.

1128
00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:52.166
What? Why?
I thought you needed this.

1129
00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:54.166
I do or at least. I don't know.

1130
00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:55.800
everyone keeps
telling me that I do.

1131
00:58:55.934 --> 00:58:58.033
but it's like every time
I open my laptop.

1132
00:58:58.166 --> 00:59:00.867
just this wave of exhaustion

1133
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:04.033
just flows over me.

1134
00:59:04.166 --> 00:59:05.400
Burn out.
Do you remember Gareth?

1135
00:59:05.533 --> 00:59:07.133
The guy I who trained me?

1136
00:59:07.266 --> 00:59:09.567
He just up and quit.
No job. no plan. no nothing.

1137
00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:11.133
That is terrifying.

1138
00:59:11.266 --> 00:59:12.433
Or is it brave?

1139
00:59:12.567 --> 00:59:14.367
I'm sticking with terrifying.

1140
00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:16.066
Well in that case.
you might want to stock up on

1141
00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:18.567
some Galaxy bars and take
another crack at that paper.

1142
00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:20.567
In that case.
I'm going to stay here forever.

1143
00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:22.033
Aw. Love you.

1144
00:59:22.166 --> 00:59:23.467
Love you. too. Bye.

1145
00:59:39.333 --> 00:59:42.967
Hi. there.
May I use your printer. please?

1146
00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:44.600
Of course.

1147
00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:50.700
So sorry to bother you.

1148
00:59:50.834 --> 00:59:53.900
Oh. you're very welcome as long
as you know how it works.

1149
00:59:54.033 --> 00:59:55.767
I'm rather old fashioned.
I'm afraid.

1150
00:59:55.900 --> 00:59:59.300
Oh. well.
So am I. believe it or not.

1151
00:59:59.433 --> 01:00:01.033
It's actually why I need it.

1152
01:00:01.166 --> 01:00:02.734
Most people prefer to make
notes on a computer these days.

1153
01:00:02.867 --> 01:00:06.300
but I actually like
the hardcopy with a red pen.

1154
01:00:08.667 --> 01:00:10.533
You should see my manuscripts.

1155
01:00:10.667 --> 01:00:12.467
All the notes in the margins

1156
01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:15.133
they just look
like hieroglyphics.

1157
01:00:15.266 --> 01:00:16.400
Probably hard to decipher them.

1158
01:00:16.533 --> 01:00:20.333
but you know. it's my process.

1159
01:00:22.367 --> 01:00:24.700
It's on the desk in the corner.

1160
01:00:24.834 --> 01:00:26.066
Thank you.

1161
01:00:31.066 --> 01:00:32.600
Carol Lambert.

1162
01:00:35.233 --> 01:00:36.900
She made your reservation.
didn't she?

1163
01:00:37.033 --> 01:00:40.133
My mom.

1164
01:00:40.266 --> 01:00:41.867
Yeah.

1165
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.767
What was her maiden name?

1166
01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:46.400
Penberthy.

1167
01:00:46.533 --> 01:00:50.800
You know. she actually
grew up in this house.

1168
01:00:50.934 --> 01:00:53.700
My grandparents are
the ones who sold it to you.

1169
01:00:53.834 --> 01:00:56.300
Would you excuse me a moment?

1170
01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:01.667
Of course.

1171
01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:17.133
Joss.

1172
01:01:17.266 --> 01:01:18.700
I have something for you.

1173
01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:24.834
I found this box
about a year ago.

1174
01:01:24.967 --> 01:01:27.367
when I was
clearing out the mill.

1175
01:01:28.934 --> 01:01:30.734
I assumed it must've
been left by your--

1176
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.300
By your mother.

1177
01:01:43.467 --> 01:01:46.433
It just looked like
some old trinkets.

1178
01:01:46.567 --> 01:01:48.967
and that tattered book.

1179
01:01:53.333 --> 01:01:55.200
But I remember
thinking at the time.

1180
01:01:55.333 --> 01:01:58.433
I can't just throw them away.

1181
01:01:58.567 --> 01:02:01.033
They're someone's treasures.

1182
01:02:06.867 --> 01:02:08.867
It's from my grandma to my mom.

1183
01:02:15.166 --> 01:02:17.867
She memorized all these poems.
she would recite them to me.

1184
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.600
I wonder if she
knew this was here.

1185
01:02:26.967 --> 01:02:28.700
Ever since she died.
I feel like...

1186
01:02:30.867 --> 01:02:32.967
something important
has gone missing.

1187
01:02:36.233 --> 01:02:37.266
I keep searching for her.

1188
01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:38.867
as if she's just out of sight.

1189
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.200
and if I just
look hard enough...

1190
01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:47.767
That I can find her. again.

1191
01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:51.867
Loss is a terrible thing.

1192
01:02:53.967 --> 01:02:55.767
It never completely goes away.

1193
01:03:03.633 --> 01:03:04.967
I miss her so much.

1194
01:03:06.367 --> 01:03:07.767
Ah. love.

1195
01:03:11.467 --> 01:03:13.000
She's still with you.

1196
01:03:13.133 --> 01:03:17.400
Her love lives inside of you.

1197
01:03:17.533 --> 01:03:20.700
and you carry her in your heart.

1198
01:03:24.734 --> 01:03:27.500
I'd give anything
to see her again.

1199
01:03:29.266 --> 01:03:30.834
You will.

1200
01:03:34.734 --> 01:03:36.000
I'll leave you to it.

1201
01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:41.467
Take as long as you need.

1202
01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:43.000
Thank you.

1203
01:04:07.667 --> 01:04:09.800
The Presence of Love.

1204
01:04:17.533 --> 01:04:20.567
Oh. mom.

1205
01:04:32.834 --> 01:04:34.633
Danny:
Okay. shouldn't be
a long meeting.

1206
01:04:34.767 --> 01:04:36.300
They're just gonna
go over the testing with you

1207
01:04:36.433 --> 01:04:38.900
and introduce you
to some key people. Alright?

1208
01:04:39.033 --> 01:04:40.266
Okay.

1209
01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:44.333
I know it's not easy.

1210
01:04:44.467 --> 01:04:45.633
You mean. reading?

1211
01:04:45.767 --> 01:04:47.800
Just life. in general.

1212
01:04:47.934 --> 01:04:49.734
There are so many
emotions we have to navigate.

1213
01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:54.233
But--

1214
01:04:54.367 --> 01:04:56.133
You have me.

1215
01:04:56.266 --> 01:04:58.000
and you can talk to me
about anything. yeah?

1216
01:04:58.133 --> 01:04:59.500
I know. Dad.

1217
01:04:59.633 --> 01:05:01.633
Yeah. and it's not just me.

1218
01:05:01.767 --> 01:05:04.233
There's so many people
in your life that love you.

1219
01:05:04.367 --> 01:05:06.767
You have Isabelle
and Felix and Lily.

1220
01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:08.533
and your Gran. of course.

1221
01:05:08.667 --> 01:05:11.367
You can talk to any of us about
anything whenever you want.

1222
01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:13.000
I'm glad we came here.

1223
01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:15.700
To the farm.

1224
01:05:15.834 --> 01:05:17.400
Me. too. love.

1225
01:05:17.533 --> 01:05:19.033
Alright. Let's get in there

1226
01:05:19.166 --> 01:05:20.800
and show them what the
Carters are made of.

1227
01:05:22.533 --> 01:05:23.967
Come on.
Let's do it.

1228
01:06:54.367 --> 01:06:55.467
Someone is still
hard at work.

1229
01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:57.800
Oh. No.
Not really. Hi!

1230
01:06:57.934 --> 01:06:59.233
Tegan:
Hi. Joss.

1231
01:06:59.367 --> 01:07:00.934
Daniel:
No?

1232
01:07:01.066 --> 01:07:03.967
Yeah. At this point. I'm
just reading for pleasure.

1233
01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:05.467
I hope it's your
birthday book.

1234
01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:06.633
It's your birthday?

1235
01:07:06.767 --> 01:07:08.000
Tomorrow.

1236
01:07:08.133 --> 01:07:11.166
Hang on. If you're out
here. relaxing.

1237
01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:13.266
does that mean you
turned in your paper?

1238
01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:15.367
No.
No?

1239
01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:20.166
Because I. uh. withdrew
my application for tenure.

1240
01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:23.667
I thought that was the goal.
It was. but I realized

1241
01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:27.667
that all that tenure is
is professional security.

1242
01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:31.333
I think I confused a
secure job with safety.

1243
01:07:31.467 --> 01:07:34.000
There's no guarantees.

1244
01:07:34.133 --> 01:07:36.533
Life's a risk.

1245
01:07:36.667 --> 01:07:38.700
I think I have to
embrace it.

1246
01:07:38.834 --> 01:07:39.834
Really?

1247
01:07:39.967 --> 01:07:42.867
Yeah.
Yeah.

1248
01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.600
I didn't quit my job. though. if
that's what you're asking.

1249
01:07:45.734 --> 01:07:47.667
No.

1250
01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:52.166
I. uh. I requested to stay on
as an adjunct professor for now.

1251
01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:54.433
The dean already ask me if I
want to teach the summer term.

1252
01:07:54.567 --> 01:07:57.133
Well. this sounds like a
decision worth celebrating.

1253
01:07:57.266 --> 01:07:59.967
I think.

1254
01:08:00.166 --> 01:08:03.433
Tegan... I have something
I want to give you. Come here.

1255
01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:07.600
It's for you.
What is it?

1256
01:08:07.734 --> 01:08:11.000
It's a book of poetry that
my grandparents gave to my mom.

1257
01:08:11.133 --> 01:08:12.767
She had dyslexia. too.

1258
01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:14.600
Your mom?

1259
01:08:14.734 --> 01:08:16.900
Yeah.

1260
01:08:17.033 --> 01:08:19.500
You'll see all
of her notations.

1261
01:08:19.633 --> 01:08:22.700
that she saw the
poetry differently than I do.

1262
01:08:22.834 --> 01:08:25.800
but a beautiful
way that's all her own.

1263
01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:28.567
You'll see.

1264
01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:30.266
There's no wrong way.

1265
01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:32.500
Thank you.
You're welcome.

1266
01:08:32.633 --> 01:08:33.867
I'm going to go
tell Gran.

1267
01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.367
Okay.

1268
01:08:37.033 --> 01:08:38.600
Thank you.

1269
01:08:38.734 --> 01:08:39.900
It's nothing.

1270
01:08:40.033 --> 01:08:41.967
No. We both know it's
everything.

1271
01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:47.867
I know you were planning
on attending anyway.

1272
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.500
but. um... we'd really love
for you to ride along with us.

1273
01:08:52.633 --> 01:08:53.867
To the festival?

1274
01:08:56.467 --> 01:08:57.834
I'd love to.

1275
01:08:57.967 --> 01:09:00.100
Okay. Brill.

1276
01:09:01.133 --> 01:09:02.000
Brill.
Yeah.

1277
01:09:17.967 --> 01:09:19.133
Do you
have everything?

1278
01:09:19.266 --> 01:09:21.333
Yes.
I've already checked twice.

1279
01:09:21.467 --> 01:09:23.000
Third time's a charm.
Now. remember.

1280
01:09:23.133 --> 01:09:25.133
when you're up there. just
see how you feel. okay?

1281
01:09:25.266 --> 01:09:26.734
Look. Could we get a move on?

1282
01:09:26.867 --> 01:09:28.667
I want to be right at the front.
I'll meet you in there.

1283
01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:30.667
I just need a minute. alright?
Let's make that

1284
01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:34.333
a British minute. shall we? Not
the American interpretation.

1285
01:09:34.467 --> 01:09:35.867
Of course.

1286
01:09:59.066 --> 01:10:01.166
Woman:
I wonder that you
will still be talking.

1287
01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:03.667
Signior Benedick. nobody
marks you.

1288
01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:05.100
Man:
What. my dear Lady--

1289
01:10:05.233 --> 01:10:08.600
Oh. there's an
exclamation mark. Disdain!

1290
01:10:08.734 --> 01:10:10.467
...and the door of
your heart.

1291
01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.500
May the road rise up...

1292
01:10:12.633 --> 01:10:16.000
There was once a
day that owed time.

1293
01:10:16.133 --> 01:10:18.767
Girl:
With their trouble
behind. side by side.

1294
01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:21.133
then the wolf and the
rabbit pushed off to sea

1295
01:10:21.266 --> 01:10:23.734
and traveled to the one
place they could run free.

1296
01:10:33.133 --> 01:10:34.934
Alright. everyone.

1297
01:10:35.066 --> 01:10:37.867
It looks like we have
one more reading.

1298
01:10:44.233 --> 01:10:46.633
Hi. I wrote a
poem for today.

1299
01:10:46.767 --> 01:10:48.333
but I'm not going
to read it.

1300
01:10:48.467 --> 01:10:50.166
It wasn't ready.

1301
01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:51.734
I'm going
to read a poem

1302
01:10:51.867 --> 01:10:54.467
that somebody else
wrote instead.

1303
01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:56.667
a special one from
a friend.

1304
01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:59.934
"The Presence of Love"
by Samuel Coleridge.

1305
01:11:00.133 --> 01:11:03.200
"And in
Life's noisiest hour.

1306
01:11:03.333 --> 01:11:05.133
there whispers still

1307
01:11:05.266 --> 01:11:08.667
the ceaseless Love
of Thee.

1308
01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:13.400
The heart's Self-solace
and soliloquy.

1309
01:11:13.533 --> 01:11:15.300
You mould my Hopes.

1310
01:11:15.433 --> 01:11:17.500
you fashion me within...

1311
01:11:17.633 --> 01:11:19.633
And looking
to the Heaven.

1312
01:11:19.767 --> 01:11:22.567
that bends above you.

1313
01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:26.467
How oft! I bless the Lot.
that made me love you."

1314
01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:38.533
Oh. you did so good!

1315
01:11:38.667 --> 01:11:41.200
I'm so proud of you.

1316
01:11:41.333 --> 01:11:43.900
You must thank Ms.
Lambert for all her help.

1317
01:11:44.033 --> 01:11:45.533
Thank you so much.

1318
01:11:45.667 --> 01:11:47.567
Oh. Of course.

1319
01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:49.667
You were fantastic.

1320
01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:53.533
and you do know that's my
very favorite poem?

1321
01:11:53.667 --> 01:11:56.033
I didn't have a present to
give you. so I wanted

1322
01:11:56.166 --> 01:11:58.967
to read the poem at the
festival for your birthday.

1323
01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:02.734
Gran helped with the cards.
so it's partly from her. too.

1324
01:12:04.367 --> 01:12:05.967
It was perfect.

1325
01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:07.633
Now. let's get
you a cake.

1326
01:12:07.767 --> 01:12:08.900
That's a brilliant idea.

1327
01:12:09.033 --> 01:12:10.567
I don't
need a cake.

1328
01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:12.433
It's your birthday.

1329
01:12:12.567 --> 01:12:13.934
I know. but it's
not a big one.

1330
01:12:14.066 --> 01:12:15.200
Still. we should go out.

1331
01:12:15.333 --> 01:12:17.467
Every year should
be celebrated.

1332
01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:19.767
And you. little missy.

1333
01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:21.300
have your own party to go to.

1334
01:12:21.433 --> 01:12:23.066
So you should go
and join your classmates.

1335
01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:24.266
Yes!
Yeah.

1336
01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:25.734
I'll take her to
the party.

1337
01:12:25.867 --> 01:12:28.767
You two
should go out.

1338
01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:30.900
Tegan. your
fans await you.

1339
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:38.967
Should we walk around?

1340
01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:39.967
Yeah. Sure.

1341
01:12:54.066 --> 01:12:55.200
I still got to
get you that cake.

1342
01:12:55.333 --> 01:12:57.433
Oh. It's just
a silly birthday.

1343
01:12:57.567 --> 01:12:59.533
I don't need
anything special.

1344
01:12:59.667 --> 01:13:01.300
This view is enough.

1345
01:13:04.166 --> 01:13:06.467
What if I want
to do more?

1346
01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:09.300
There's so much I
can show you.

1347
01:13:09.433 --> 01:13:11.000
I'd like
that. but...

1348
01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
I'm leaving in
the morning.

1349
01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.100
Can't believe it's
almost been two weeks.

1350
01:13:19.233 --> 01:13:20.633
Then stay longer.

1351
01:13:22.133 --> 01:13:24.500
Don't tempt me.
I have to get home.

1352
01:13:24.633 --> 01:13:26.633
Then let's celebrate right
now. tonight.

1353
01:13:27.834 --> 01:13:29.834
I feel like
I already did.

1354
01:13:30.967 --> 01:13:32.967
Right here.

1355
01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:35.133
This place that she
always wanted me to see.

1356
01:13:36.333 --> 01:13:39.133
The festival we
planned to attend.

1357
01:13:39.266 --> 01:13:42.066
It's easier if I
go back now.

1358
01:13:43.834 --> 01:13:46.500
Can I at least take you to
the station tomorrow?

1359
01:13:46.633 --> 01:13:48.700
Everything has all
been so perfect.

1360
01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:52.567
I think I'd rather just
end on this.

1361
01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:56.700
This?

1362
01:13:58.734 --> 01:14:03.266
This sounds 19th century...
and not very promising.

1363
01:14:16.867 --> 01:14:18.567
"You lie in all
my many thoughts."

1364
01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:18.100
Okay. Make sure to
get the mill in it. yeah?

1365
01:16:18.233 --> 01:16:19.500
Thank you.

1366
01:16:20.934 --> 01:16:22.166
Thanks.
Okay.

1367
01:16:40.266 --> 01:16:43.100
Hey.

1368
01:16:43.233 --> 01:16:45.400
I'll miss you.

1369
01:16:45.533 --> 01:16:48.033
So will I.

1370
01:16:48.166 --> 01:16:50.266
I'm so glad you
got to see this place.

1371
01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:51.934
Me. too.

1372
01:16:52.066 --> 01:16:54.867
I'm not sure the
experience was

1373
01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.567
quite what you
wanted it to be.

1374
01:16:58.100 --> 01:16:59.400
It was so much more.

1375
01:17:09.433 --> 01:17:11.000
You give your dad
a hug for me.

1376
01:17:11.133 --> 01:17:12.000
Okay.

1377
01:17:20.834 --> 01:17:22.233
Thank you.

1378
01:18:00.734 --> 01:18:02.133
What?

1379
01:18:03.667 --> 01:18:05.233
I have to tell you something.

1380
01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.166
Your tea method is
far superior to mine.

1381
01:18:13.867 --> 01:18:16.300
I'm glad you've
finally come around.

1382
01:18:16.433 --> 01:18:18.000
Thank you.

1383
01:18:22.033 --> 01:18:24.300
What about the turbines?

1384
01:18:24.433 --> 01:18:26.600
Any chance you've
come around to those?

1385
01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:29.867
We have to address it.

1386
01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.033
So let's address it.

1387
01:18:32.166 --> 01:18:34.633
They are hideous
and noisy.

1388
01:18:34.767 --> 01:18:37.367
They'll be on the far
west pasture on the hill.

1389
01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:39.533
The noise will be minimal.
And what about the sheep?

1390
01:18:39.667 --> 01:18:41.567
What about the sheep?
They won't like it.

1391
01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:43.000
Well. they told you
that. did they?

1392
01:18:47.066 --> 01:18:48.233
I know this
is hard for you.

1393
01:18:52.333 --> 01:18:54.500
But it's an opportunity
that would really help us.

1394
01:18:56.900 --> 01:18:58.500
I think we should do it.

1395
01:19:01.734 --> 01:19:03.133
Very well.

1396
01:19:05.333 --> 01:19:06.867
Go ahead.

1397
01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.633
You have my blessing.

1398
01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:15.633
It must feel like you're losing
everything you hold dear.

1399
01:19:15.767 --> 01:19:17.734
but I promise you
I'll never let that happen.

1400
01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:21.300
I love
this place. too.

1401
01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:24.867
So does Tegan.

1402
01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:29.367
We're doing it
for her. too. Mum.

1403
01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:35.500
Ah. come here.

1404
01:19:38.433 --> 01:19:40.533
Forgive me for what
I said to you.

1405
01:19:41.667 --> 01:19:43.000
It was wicked.

1406
01:19:43.133 --> 01:19:45.400
and I've regretted
it ever since.

1407
01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.633
Your father would be very
proud of you. my boy.

1408
01:19:52.433 --> 01:19:56.800
You're a wonderful man
and an excellent father.

1409
01:19:56.934 --> 01:19:58.800
Mm.

1410
01:19:58.934 --> 01:20:01.767
And you deserve
to be loved

1411
01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:04.433
by someone who cares as
deeply as you do.

1412
01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.467
Man on speaker:
Train to Paddington
leaves in two minutes.

1413
01:20:30.333 --> 01:20:32.834
Joss!

1414
01:20:32.967 --> 01:20:34.300
Hey.

1415
01:20:34.433 --> 01:20:36.300
What are you doing here?

1416
01:20:36.433 --> 01:20:38.033
I need to stop you
from getting on that train.

1417
01:20:38.166 --> 01:20:39.500
But I--
Please. I've got two minutes

1418
01:20:39.633 --> 01:20:42.834
to say this to you.
so let me just say it.

1419
01:20:44.433 --> 01:20:46.667
You came to Cornwall
for many reasons.

1420
01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:48.633
and I know that I
wasn't one of them.

1421
01:20:48.767 --> 01:20:50.333
In fact. I'm
probably to blame

1422
01:20:50.467 --> 01:20:52.333
for constantly distracting
you from your research paper

1423
01:20:52.467 --> 01:20:54.633
and-- and stopping you
from achieving

1424
01:20:54.767 --> 01:20:56.867
the thing you
most wanted to achieve.

1425
01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.066
But in the words of the
great English poet.

1426
01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:02.500
"You can't always
get what you want."

1427
01:21:02.633 --> 01:21:05.834
I repeat. "You can't
always get what you want.

1428
01:21:05.967 --> 01:21:07.734
But if you try sometimes.
you just might find..."

1429
01:21:07.867 --> 01:21:09.233
"You get what
you need."

1430
01:21:09.367 --> 01:21:10.867
That's the one.

1431
01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.867
Don't leave. Joss.

1432
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.200
Use the cottage as a base.
Travel the world.

1433
01:21:15.333 --> 01:21:16.834
Fill up that
passport of yours.

1434
01:21:16.967 --> 01:21:19.200
Eat every single piece
of chocolate you can find

1435
01:21:19.333 --> 01:21:23.100
and-- and read every single
book that you wanted to. twice.

1436
01:21:23.233 --> 01:21:26.367
You're an expert
in Romantic literature.

1437
01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:27.600
Don't you think it's
time you did something

1438
01:21:27.734 --> 01:21:29.233
perfectly romantic?

1439
01:21:30.967 --> 01:21:33.100
I have a life
back in Boston.

1440
01:21:33.233 --> 01:21:35.200
An apartment. friends.

1441
01:21:35.333 --> 01:21:38.834
A professor once told
me that life is a risk.

1442
01:21:38.967 --> 01:21:40.600
You just have to
embrace it.

1443
01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:45.000
Do you know how scary
that would actually be?

1444
01:21:45.133 --> 01:21:46.734
I know.

1445
01:21:46.867 --> 01:21:48.367
but you'll have
the best wingman.

1446
01:21:53.834 --> 01:21:55.667
Okay.

1447
01:22:11.767 --> 01:22:13.166
You sure about this?

1448
01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:15.233
No.

1449
01:22:15.367 --> 01:22:18.233
I'm not. but I've
been banging my head

1450
01:22:18.367 --> 01:22:20.433
against the same
rock wall for years.

1451
01:22:20.567 --> 01:22:22.600
May as well try a
new direction.

1452
01:22:22.734 --> 01:22:24.633
see how that
goes for a bit.

1453
01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:27.300
You want to give me
a ride back?

1454
01:22:29.633 --> 01:22:31.200
Direct or scenic?

1455
01:22:33.633 --> 01:22:35.600
What do you think?
Mm.

1456
01:22:46.066 --> 01:22:49.800
You secured a luncheon
with Dylan Turner?

1457
01:22:49.934 --> 01:22:51.633
Well. the kids are
so excited he's reading.

1458
01:22:51.767 --> 01:22:53.233
I just wanted to
make the most of it.

1459
01:22:53.367 --> 01:22:55.433
I mean. between that
and the panel of writers

1460
01:22:55.567 --> 01:22:57.467
you pulled together. you
realize this festival

1461
01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:59.066
is going to market itself?

1462
01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:01.133
I'm just happy
to be a part of it.

1463
01:23:01.266 --> 01:23:02.667
Not as happy as I am.

1464
01:23:04.300 --> 01:23:06.166
Although I doubt I'm the
most excited one here.

1465
01:23:14.767 --> 01:23:17.400
I know this is your noisiest
hour. but I was wondering

1466
01:23:17.533 --> 01:23:19.633
if you had the time to
take a walk with me.

1467
01:23:25.867 --> 01:23:26.734
Always.
