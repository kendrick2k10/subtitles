00:00:47.797 --> 00:00:49.799
{\an8}Mm. something like that.

10
00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:51.217
{\an8}You don't have
to ask the mirror

11
00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:52.719
{\an8}who's the fairest
in the land.

12
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.221
{\an8}You live with

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:56.848

on your beauty.

14
00:00:56.848 --> 00:00:59.351
Oh-ho... you are smooth.

17
00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:09.110
{\an8}Hey. do you remember

18
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.987
{\an8}that gorgeous
Venetian mirror we saw

19
00:01:10.987 --> 00:01:12.614
{\an8}when we were on Murano?

20
00:01:12.614 --> 00:01:13.865
{\an8}With the funny shop owner?

21
00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:15.658
{\an8} Oh. yes!

22
00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:18.119
"You will have six children."

23
00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.538
{\an8}I am willing to compromise
with five.

24
00:01:20.538 --> 00:01:21.790
{\an8}No. I'm serious.

25
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.083
{\an8}If I could have figured out

26
00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:25.251
{\an8}how to fit that mirror
on an airplane with me.

27
00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.128
{\an8}it would be hanging on this wall
right now--

28
00:01:27.128 --> 00:01:28.254
{\an8}it was so beautiful.

29
00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:29.798
{\an8}Yes.

30
00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:32.967
{\an8}What is that?
What is that smell?

31
00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:38.098
{\an8}- No!
- Uh. I don't know.

32
00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:40.392
{\an8}Oh. cappuccinos?
Like every morning.

33
00:01:40.392 --> 00:01:41.810
{\an8}No. something else.
What is that?

34
00:01:43.978 --> 00:01:45.605
{\an8}Come. find out.

35
00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:51.277
Cornettos!

36
00:01:52.696 --> 00:01:54.864
I woke up early. so...

37
00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:56.199
How early did you wake up?

38
00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:58.034
They take hours to make.

39
00:01:58.034 --> 00:02:00.078
Early enough...

40
00:02:00.078 --> 00:02:01.996
to drive down to Gianni's
and buy them.

41
00:02:01.996 --> 00:02:03.748
So funny.

42
00:02:03.748 --> 00:02:06.543
That's the exact same recipe
that I use.

43
00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:07.502
There you go.

44
00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:09.504
Thank you.

45
00:02:09.504 --> 00:02:12.257
Mm.

46
00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:14.551
Why did you get up so early?

47
00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:17.137
Are you nervous about
the opening tonight?

48
00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:19.139
I should be.
but I'm really not.

49
00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.474
I feel confident
in our product line.

50
00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:24.144
Matteo's learning
the business quickly.

51
00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:25.478
The store looks good.

52
00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:27.355
Your wife will be there
to help you.

53
00:02:27.355 --> 00:02:29.816
My wife
will be there to help.

54
00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:32.736
I love your confidence.

55
00:02:32.736 --> 00:02:34.487
I wish I could borrow some.

56
00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:36.865
I think you are very confident
about your job.

57
00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:39.492
If Nancy retired today.

58
00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:41.161
and you were promoted
to take her place

59
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:42.954
as Department Chair.

60
00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:45.498
which part of her job
couldn't you do?

61
00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:47.167
Mm...

62
00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:48.460
I can do all of it.

63
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.212
and if not. I know
where to find the answers.

64
00:02:51.212 --> 00:02:52.255
See?

65
00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:54.132
You are confident.

66
00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:57.218
but Nancy gets inside your head.
pulls up a chair.

67
00:02:57.218 --> 00:02:59.596
and tries to convince you
the sky isn't blue.

68
00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:00.889
Heh. Okay.

69
00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.265
I know you don't love Nancy.

70
00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:04.184
but she has been
a good mentor to me.

71
00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:05.518
I don't dislike her.

72
00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:08.188
My only problem
is the effect she has on you.

73
00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:09.481
Well. on us.

74
00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:10.899
On us?
What do you mean?

75
00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:13.026
I mean. us--

76
00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:14.652
our life. children.

77
00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:17.697
You've been promised
this promotion.

78
00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:20.200
but she never seems
to actually retire.

79
00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:24.245
I just resent someone else

80
00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:26.956
having that much control
over our lives.

81
00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:30.627
Perfect timing!

82
00:03:32.253 --> 00:03:33.797
Thank you.

83
00:03:33.797 --> 00:03:36.341
Hmm!

84
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:38.051
♪ Mm-hmm-mm ♪

85
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:39.260
What is it?

86
00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:45.767
From Nonna. For you.

87
00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.771
Oh! What?

88
00:03:57.112 --> 00:03:59.447
Oh! This is gorgeous.

89
00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:00.740
What?

90
00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.744
Oh. let me read the card.

91
00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:06.496
Wow.

92
00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:12.877
- It's in Italian.
- Uh-uh.

93
00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:14.963
No. go ahead.

94
00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:16.631
You can do it.

95
00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:19.884
"Dearest Emma...

96
00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:23.096
I... made this... for you

97
00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:26.558
to wear to the..."

98
00:04:26.558 --> 00:04:29.144
<i>"Inaugurazione."</i>
In-aug-ur-a-zione.

99
00:04:29.144 --> 00:04:30.812
- Like a party?
- Right.

100
00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:32.939
Yeah. Tonight.

101
00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:35.108
"I wish to be there..."

102
00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:36.443
"I wish I could."
" <i>Vorrei."</i>

103
00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:38.278
"Wish I could be there.

104
00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:39.904
but remember--

105
00:04:39.904 --> 00:04:43.116
when you wear my lace.
you wear my love."

106
00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:44.617
-"...My love."
- Ohh...

107
00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:45.869
Nonna!

108
00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:47.037
I miss her.

109
00:04:47.037 --> 00:04:48.246
I miss her. too.

110
00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:50.790
And you are going
to be beautiful in this.

111
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.417
Thank you.

112
00:05:15.273 --> 00:05:17.901
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa!
Stop! Stop! Stop!

113
00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:20.070
You're scratchin' up the walls!
Here.

114
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.446
You need a fork.

115
00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:22.989
- A fork?
- Yes.

116
00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:24.407
A fork.

117
00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:26.451
Like... that.

118
00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:29.287
Now let me see the painting.

119
00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:31.373
Ah...

120
00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:34.167
See?

121
00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:36.002
Life hacks.

122
00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:37.754
Serious. Matteo...

123
00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:40.507
you spend too much time
watching videos.

124
00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:43.218
And you spend-a too much time
a-scratching up our walls. ah!

125
00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:45.720
<i>- Caffè?
- Sì.</i>

126
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.763
<i>Andiamo. dai.</i>

127
00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:51.518
And we'll see you next week.

128
00:05:58.566 --> 00:05:59.818
Wow.

129
00:05:59.818 --> 00:06:01.027
I know. right?

130
00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:02.862
This class is <i>a lot.</i>

131
00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:06.282
I know it's been a while.

132
00:06:06.282 --> 00:06:07.617
but do you remember

133
00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:09.994
if your Intro to Art History
class was as. uh...

134
00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:12.205
Rowdy? No.

135
00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:14.040
Well... maybe.

136
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.458
We had that one kid

137
00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:16.835
who kept getting food
delivered to the class.

138
00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:17.836
Remember him?

139
00:06:17.836 --> 00:06:19.546
- Vividly. In my nightmares.
- Oh!

140
00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:21.673
Well. you know how it is.

141
00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:23.925
They all just want
that General Ed credit.

142
00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:24.926
so they can get back

143
00:06:24.926 --> 00:06:26.720
to their Business
and STEM classes.

144
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.597
Mm. Yeah. I remember
my intro class in Italy.

145
00:06:29.597 --> 00:06:30.807
They were bored. too.

146
00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:32.392
They were a lot more
polite about it.

147
00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:33.643
but still... bored.

148
00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:35.520
Then I started focusing on art

149
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.397
that was actually relevant
to them.

150
00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:39.482
and they perked right up.

151
00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:41.568
Oh. I know
that's your plan here. too.

152
00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:42.694
Those kids
are gonna love Art History

153
00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:43.903
by the end of the semester

154
00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:45.238
because of you.

155
00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:47.115
Oh... we'll see.

156
00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:51.369
And don't worry
about grading the essays

157
00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:52.746
until the weekend.

158
00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:54.247
And if you don't have time.
I'm happy to do it.

159
00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:55.415
Ooh. would you mind doing it?

160
00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:56.624
I met this really great guy

161
00:06:56.624 --> 00:06:57.959
and we're going
to the Upper Peninsula

162
00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:59.252
this weekend.

163
00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:01.463
We're gonna hike.
and take a bunch of pictures.

164
00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:03.798
and camp under the stars.

165
00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:05.091
Really?

166
00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:06.468
No. Of course not.

167
00:07:06.468 --> 00:07:09.054
I'm going to be at home
all weekend. alone.

168
00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:10.472
eating box mac-and-cheese.

169
00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:12.599
and scrolling through.
trying to find

170
00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:14.267
a documentary
I haven't seen twice.

171
00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:16.061
I will grade the papers.

172
00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:17.562
Thank you.

173
00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:19.189
- Mm-hmm.
- Confession?

174
00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:21.191
I love box mac-and-cheese.

175
00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:25.195
My Grandma Bea used to slice up
hot dogs into it.

176
00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:26.613
so that's my favorite way
to eat it.

177
00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:27.906
Best comfort food ever.

178
00:07:27.906 --> 00:07:30.617
Although. the leftovers
do not heat up well.

179
00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:32.911
I'm sorry. you have
leftover mac-and-cheese?

180
00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:34.704
I don't even understand
what that means.

181
00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:37.499
You probably have leftover wine
sometimes. too.

182
00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:39.959
Whoa. Whoa. whoa. whoa.
Let's not get carried away.

183
00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:42.837
Can I show you
something gorgeous?

184
00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:44.339
Absolutely.

185
00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:47.300
Paolo's grandmother made this

186
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.844
for me to wear
to the opening tonight.

187
00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:51.137
That is...

188
00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:52.389
perfection.

189
00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:54.516
Nonna is so good at this.

190
00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:56.559
Hey...

191
00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:57.977
do you want to come tonight?

192
00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:01.231
Yeah! We could hire you
to take pictures.

193
00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:03.983
And...
there's gonna be good food.

194
00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:04.984
Food?

195
00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:07.320
Catered by <i>Il Pirata.</i>

196
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.530
Do not toy
with a starving grad student.

197
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:09.739
Free food.

198
00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:11.366
Those words--
those words right there...

199
00:08:11.366 --> 00:08:12.659
those are the magic words.

200
00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:14.494
I will be there
after my last seminar.

201
00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:15.995
Okay. I'll see you there.

202
00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:20.500
I'm gonna head down
and start to help them set up.

203
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.960
Emma? A moment?

204
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.671
I'd like to discuss
the article you proposed.

205
00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:26.464
Actually. could we--
could we do it later?

206
00:08:26.464 --> 00:08:27.674
I'm just headed down
to House of Stefano

207
00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:29.009
for their opening.

208
00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:31.052
Won't take but two minutes.
My office. please.

209
00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:32.262
Oh.

210
00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:34.222
Okay.

211
00:08:40.145 --> 00:08:41.479
"Two minutes."

212
00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:44.065
"Two minutes..."

213
00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.256
Emma!

214
00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:09.966
- I'm so sorry I'm late.
- Finally.

215
00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:13.011
I got stuck at work.
and Nancy just kept...

216
00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:14.304
Oh. no.

217
00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:15.430
What happened?

218
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:16.890
I forgot... Nonna's lace!

219
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.683
- It's okay.
- It's just sitting

220
00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:19.559
on the desk at work.
I'm sorry--

221
00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:20.810
It's okay. it's okay.

222
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.812
Come here.
I have something to show you.

223
00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:28.568
What? The veil?

224
00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.195
Where did you--
Where did you get this?

225
00:09:30.195 --> 00:09:32.197
How did this get here?

226
00:09:32.197 --> 00:09:33.782
We brought it. of course!

227
00:09:33.782 --> 00:09:35.784
It can't be an opening
of the House of Stefano

228
00:09:35.784 --> 00:09:37.410
without its most famous work.

229
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.286
And its biggest fans!

230
00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:40.497
Oh!

231
00:09:40.497 --> 00:09:42.540
You came!

232
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.625
Of course.
We wouldn't miss it.

233
00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:45.377
Did you bring the baby?

234
00:09:45.377 --> 00:09:46.586
No. he's in Boston.

235
00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:48.129
Peter says
they're gonna order a keg.

236
00:09:48.129 --> 00:09:50.090
shoot some pool.
and watch the playoffs.

237
00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:53.885
That sounds like
a great weekend to me!

238
00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:55.637
Did you meet Matteo.
Paulo's cousin?

239
00:09:55.637 --> 00:09:56.721
- We did.
- Yeah.

240
00:09:56.721 --> 00:09:57.847
He just moved here
from Florida.

241
00:09:57.847 --> 00:09:59.683
To help
with the family business.

242
00:09:59.683 --> 00:10:02.352
He has yet to spend
a winter in Chicago. though.

243
00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:04.062
so we don't know
how long he'll stay.

244
00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:05.105
Oh. I'll be fine.

245
00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:07.190
I've got some socks
and a jacket.

246
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.608
You're gonna die.

247
00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:11.569
Okay. everyone!
It's time to mingle.

248
00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:13.822
I kid...
because I care.

249
00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:15.699
- Is she?
- She's all right.

250
00:10:32.507 --> 00:10:34.009
You have to try these.

251
00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:35.301
- Thank you.
- Oh. what's in them?

252
00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:36.970
No idea. Just eat them.

253
00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:37.929
- Mm!
- Mm!

254
00:10:37.929 --> 00:10:39.014
Right?

255
00:10:39.014 --> 00:10:39.848
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

256
00:10:39.848 --> 00:10:42.308
This caterer is amazing.

257
00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:43.977
Remind me to text Nick

258
00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:45.812
and thank him
for the recommendation.

259
00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:47.981
You know.
that is Nick's superpower--

260
00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:50.859
in any city.
he knows the best Italian food.

261
00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:52.527
You want a good burger--
you're on your own.

262
00:10:52.527 --> 00:10:54.821
You want the best tortellini?
Ask Nick.

263
00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:02.829
Oh. you were right.
Matteo is such a good guy.

264
00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:04.497
- Isn't he?
- Yeah.

265
00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:06.041
Paolo's so happy
to be working with him.

266
00:11:06.041 --> 00:11:07.167
- Mm.
- Aw.

267
00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:09.210
Hey! You made it!

268
00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.672
Hi. Uh. wait.
is this <i>the veil?</i>

269
00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:14.466
This is <i>the</i> veil.

270
00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:18.178
Avery. Tracy.
this is <i>the</i> Lily.

271
00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:19.387
Oh. hi!

272
00:11:19.387 --> 00:11:20.805
Oh. Lily. it's so nice
to finally meet you.

273
00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:21.806
You're not just
a disembodied voice

274
00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:23.183
in Emma's office.

275
00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:25.852
It's really nice to meet
the two of you. too.

276
00:11:25.852 --> 00:11:28.730
Wait. so I'm... I'm conflicted
about the veil.

277
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.775
On one hand.
I really want to photograph it.

278
00:11:31.775 --> 00:11:32.901
but on the other hand.

279
00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:35.028
I feel like I should stay
far. far away.

280
00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:36.112
Aww--

281
00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:37.113
Oh!

282
00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:41.159
It's all yours.

283
00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:43.703
I have heard too many stories
about that veil.

284
00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:45.705
I'm gonna stand way over here!

285
00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:47.791
Stories?
What kind of stories?

286
00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:50.043
You didn't tell him?

287
00:11:50.043 --> 00:11:51.544
Tell me what?

288
00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:53.296
The veil has a past.

289
00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:54.714
The veil has "a past"?

290
00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:56.716
"The veil" has a past.

291
00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:58.593
Ooh. Tell me more.
Oh. wait.

292
00:11:58.593 --> 00:12:01.262
Is this one of those "new guy"
initiation things? 'Cause...

293
00:12:01.262 --> 00:12:03.390
No. it's a...

294
00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.891
- well...
- Avery.

295
00:12:04.891 --> 00:12:06.184
- Yeah.
- Let him have it.

296
00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:07.560
No. no. no. no. no.
You're the professor. Go!

297
00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.896
Oh... okay.

298
00:12:11.064 --> 00:12:14.234
Well. this veil was made
in the 1800s

299
00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:17.070
by House of Stefano
in Burano. Italy.

300
00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.906
It was made for a bride
named Arianna.

301
00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:22.617
who would go on to become
the "Contessa di Marco".

302
00:12:22.617 --> 00:12:23.993
There's even
a little "A" embroidered

303
00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:25.578
somewhere on there
for her.

304
00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:27.330
Oh...

305
00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:28.957
Ooh.

306
00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:30.333
Now. the House of Stefano

307
00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:33.920
thought the veil
had been destroyed in a fire...

308
00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.714
...but. um.

309
00:12:35.714 --> 00:12:38.299
through this complicated--

310
00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.345
...journey of--

311
00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:44.597
...of forbidden love.

312
00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.975
and women helping each other

313
00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:49.102
in their most vulnerable
of times.

314
00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:51.688
the veil made its way
to San Francisco.

315
00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:55.608
where Avery. Tracy.
and I bought it...

316
00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:56.943
even though none of us

317
00:12:56.943 --> 00:12:58.987
was even considering
getting married at the time.

318
00:12:58.987 --> 00:13:01.948
We just. uh...
loved the lace.

319
00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:03.742
Anyway. when we bought it.

320
00:13:03.742 --> 00:13:06.369
the shopkeeper told us

321
00:13:06.369 --> 00:13:09.456
that there is a legend
attached to this veil.

322
00:13:10.457 --> 00:13:11.833
Anyone

323
00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:15.712
who is in possession
of this veil...

324
00:13:15.712 --> 00:13:17.881
will find true love.

325
00:13:19.591 --> 00:13:24.054
Even though none of us really
believed it at the time...

326
00:13:24.054 --> 00:13:25.638
Well. technically.
Avery believed it.

327
00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:26.639
Oh. I believed
every word of it.

328
00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:29.267
True. And then.
the next day...

329
00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:31.644
and I mean this--
the very next day--

330
00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:33.938
Avery met Peter.

331
00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:36.399
who is now her husband
and the father of her son.

332
00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:38.818
It's true.
It's all true.

333
00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:40.362
I mean. he did think
I was marrying someone else

334
00:13:40.362 --> 00:13:42.697
because I was carrying around
a wedding veil.

335
00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:43.823
but it was complicated.

336
00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:45.950
Long story short.
it all worked out.

337
00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.827
and the rest is our history.

338
00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:50.705
And then...

339
00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:53.708
when Tracy
brought it to New York.

340
00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:54.918
she took it to a tailor

341
00:13:54.918 --> 00:13:57.420
to have a little tiny snag
repaired. and...

342
00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:00.256
I just happened--

343
00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:01.508
Oh. right.

344
00:14:01.508 --> 00:14:03.635
I-I met my husband.

345
00:14:05.095 --> 00:14:08.348
And. when I took it to Italy
to research its origins.

346
00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:09.474
that...

347
00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:11.226
is where I met Paolo.

348
00:14:12.394 --> 00:14:13.770
This veil is the reason

349
00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.064
we opened House of Stefano
in Chicago.

350
00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:19.234
Emma wanted to be here.

351
00:14:19.234 --> 00:14:21.653
and I wanted to be
wherever she was.

352
00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:24.989
Mm.

353
00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:29.744
So... that's just part
of the story

354
00:14:29.744 --> 00:14:31.663
<i>of Arianna's veil...</i>

355
00:14:31.663 --> 00:14:33.373
<i>so far.</i>

356
00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:34.708
<i>Aw.</i>

357
00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:38.586
Look at this.

358
00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:40.380
Look at what Peter
just bought him.

359
00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.549
Oh! Little gym shoes!

360
00:14:42.549 --> 00:14:44.259
- Oh. they're so cute!
- Right?

361
00:14:44.259 --> 00:14:45.885
He said he kicked 'em off immediately.

362
00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:47.429
along with his socks.

363
00:14:47.429 --> 00:14:49.389
He just wants to be barefoot
all the time.

364
00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:50.849
Because he's a smart kid!

365
00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:54.436
I can't believe
you forgot this.

366
00:14:54.436 --> 00:14:56.021
- I know.
- Let me see.

367
00:14:56.021 --> 00:14:58.023
This lace is just exquisite.

368
00:14:58.023 --> 00:14:59.899
It's even better in person.

369
00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:01.192
I feel terrible.

370
00:15:01.192 --> 00:15:03.403
It's just sitting
on my desk at work.

371
00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:06.156
Nancy just...
she gets me flustered.

372
00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.783
You think she's doing it
on purpose?

373
00:15:08.783 --> 00:15:10.452
No. I think
it's just how she is.

374
00:15:10.452 --> 00:15:12.454
Maybe she's just afraid
of retiring.

375
00:15:12.454 --> 00:15:14.622
and-and she's just looking
for reasons not to.

376
00:15:14.622 --> 00:15:16.249
What? She doesn't wanna retire

377
00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:18.418
so she's just giving Emma
extra work?

378
00:15:18.418 --> 00:15:19.961
So she feels like
she's not qualified

379
00:15:19.961 --> 00:15:21.588
or ready to be
the Department Chair?

380
00:15:21.588 --> 00:15:23.590
I don't-- yeah. maybe.

381
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:26.593
I'm sure we'll figure it out.
I-I have plenty of time.

382
00:15:26.593 --> 00:15:27.677
I'm home!

383
00:15:27.677 --> 00:15:29.637
- Oh. congratulations.
- Yeah!

384
00:15:29.637 --> 00:15:30.764
Thank you. <i>Grazie.</i>

385
00:15:30.764 --> 00:15:32.515
Are you happy?

386
00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:33.767
Seemed like it went so well.

387
00:15:33.767 --> 00:15:34.893
Ah. <i>così. così.</i>

388
00:15:34.893 --> 00:15:36.061
I'm disappointed

389
00:15:36.061 --> 00:15:37.771
that several clients
didn't come.

390
00:15:37.771 --> 00:15:38.938
Maybe I shouldn't have
scheduled it

391
00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:40.106
during the playoffs.

392
00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:41.733
By the way--
thanks for the veil story.

393
00:15:41.733 --> 00:15:42.650
It broke the ice.

394
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.069
My pleasure.

395
00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:47.572
<i>Mamma mia.</i> what is this?

396
00:15:47.572 --> 00:15:48.823
You don't like our food?

397
00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:50.075
- No!
- It's not that.

398
00:15:50.075 --> 00:15:51.368
We're just only here one night.

399
00:15:51.368 --> 00:15:52.619
Yeah. and we can't
come to Chicago

400
00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:54.245
and not have
a deep-dish pizza.

401
00:15:54.245 --> 00:15:55.872
It's a tradition.

402
00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:57.791
Tradition?
But that's not even pizza.

403
00:15:57.791 --> 00:15:58.875
Yes. that's pizza.

404
00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:00.502
A big flying saucer.

405
00:16:01.503 --> 00:16:02.629
This is pizza.

406
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:04.381
I agree with you.

407
00:16:04.381 --> 00:16:05.965
However. I am just grateful
at this point

408
00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:07.676
that it doesn't
have pineapple on it.

409
00:16:07.676 --> 00:16:10.136
Oh. I don't ever wanna see
pineapple on my pizza ever again

410
00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:11.554
- for my natural-born life.
- Excuse me.

411
00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:14.724
<i>Pronto.</i>

412
00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:16.267
That's all just for show.

413
00:16:16.267 --> 00:16:18.228
because every time
I have leftovers.

414
00:16:18.228 --> 00:16:21.189
it somehow magically
disappears out of my fridge.

415
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:23.191
Ooh. maybe you have
a little house elf.

416
00:16:23.191 --> 00:16:24.734
Ooh-hoo.

417
00:16:24.734 --> 00:16:25.860
I hope I have
a little house elf.

418
00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.154
If I do.
can he do some cleaning

419
00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:29.823
and some laundry.
if he's gonna eat all my--

420
00:16:29.823 --> 00:16:31.491
Hey. are you okay?

421
00:16:32.742 --> 00:16:34.369
That was my sister. Sophia.

422
00:16:34.369 --> 00:16:36.955
They're taking Dad
to the hospital.

423
00:16:39.582 --> 00:16:41.751
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

424
00:16:43.545 --> 00:16:44.671
What do you want to go?

425
00:16:44.671 --> 00:16:45.839
What do you want me to do?

426
00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:46.840
Tomorrow-- I don't know.

427
00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.675
I don't know. I don't know.

428
00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:53.513
Okay. I booked you
a flight out of O'Hare.

429
00:16:53.513 --> 00:16:55.432
Leaves in three hours.

430
00:16:55.432 --> 00:16:57.392
Window seat.

431
00:16:58.685 --> 00:17:00.520
Are you sure you don't
want me to go with you?

432
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.813
Thank you for offering.

433
00:17:01.813 --> 00:17:03.690
but let me see
what's going on first.

434
00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:05.608
But if you could
check on Matteo?

435
00:17:05.608 --> 00:17:06.985
Yeah. I can do that.

436
00:17:06.985 --> 00:17:08.194
He's going to drive me
to the airport.

437
00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:09.362
so I can run through

438
00:17:09.362 --> 00:17:11.448
some last-minute things
about the store.

439
00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:15.410
You just take a breath.

440
00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.623
Could be nothing. right?

441
00:17:22.459 --> 00:17:25.712
Right. Yes.

442
00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:28.548
I think he'll be better by
the time you get off the plane.

443
00:17:28.548 --> 00:17:30.467
Okay.

444
00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:39.434
Thank you both.

445
00:17:39.434 --> 00:17:41.436
I'm glad that you are here
with Emma.

446
00:17:41.436 --> 00:17:42.604
Of course.

447
00:17:42.604 --> 00:17:44.064
Yeah. we'll keep your dad
in our prayers.

448
00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:45.857
Thank you.

449
00:17:45.857 --> 00:17:47.484
- Okay.
- Bye.

450
00:17:50.153 --> 00:17:52.280
Bye. Call you soon.

451
00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.115
Okay.

452
00:17:55.617 --> 00:17:57.827
<i>Ti amo.</i>

453
00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:38.618
I thought I heard you up.

454
00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:40.245
- Hi.
- Any news?

455
00:18:40.245 --> 00:18:42.747
Well. I'm tracking his flight.

456
00:18:42.747 --> 00:18:44.040
He is...

457
00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.543
somewhere over
the Atlantic right now.

458
00:18:46.543 --> 00:18:48.878
Are you two having fun
without me?

459
00:18:48.878 --> 00:18:51.631
You know how
I struggle with F.O.M.O.

460
00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:53.133
What's going on?

461
00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:55.135
Sophia added me
to the group chat.

462
00:18:55.135 --> 00:18:57.679
but nothing so far.

463
00:18:57.679 --> 00:18:59.389
This is one of those
"no news is good news"

464
00:18:59.389 --> 00:19:01.057
- scenarios. isn't it?
- Absolutely.

465
00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:02.642
Yeah. definitely.

466
00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:06.062
Anyway. since I was awake.
I figured I would do some work.

467
00:19:06.062 --> 00:19:07.689
So what's going on?

468
00:19:07.689 --> 00:19:10.817
Reading an article
about the veil. actually.

469
00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:13.153
I was late to the party

470
00:19:13.153 --> 00:19:15.655
because Nancy told me
she wants me to publish

471
00:19:15.655 --> 00:19:16.823
just one more time

472
00:19:16.823 --> 00:19:18.283
before she hands over the reins.

473
00:19:18.283 --> 00:19:19.743
I know.

474
00:19:19.743 --> 00:19:21.411
I know. and if it's not this.
it'll be something else.

475
00:19:21.411 --> 00:19:22.537
and then it'll be
something else.

476
00:19:22.537 --> 00:19:24.247
and then
it'll be something else. but...

477
00:19:24.247 --> 00:19:26.166
the story of the veil's
so interesting.

478
00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:27.459
I figured
I should record its history.

479
00:19:27.459 --> 00:19:29.502
Yeah.

480
00:19:29.502 --> 00:19:31.338
Do you want me to leave it
when I go tomorrow?

481
00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:33.298
I mean. I feel like
it's time to...

482
00:19:33.298 --> 00:19:35.383
you know. for someone else
to have it for a while.

483
00:19:35.383 --> 00:19:36.259
Yeah. I'm happy to keep it
at the store

484
00:19:36.259 --> 00:19:37.552
with the christening gown.

485
00:19:37.552 --> 00:19:39.304
I don't think Matteo will mind.

486
00:19:39.304 --> 00:19:41.056
So. what's the story
with Matteo anyway?

487
00:19:41.056 --> 00:19:42.515
Why did he leave Miami?

488
00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:44.184
Oh...

489
00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:46.853
a tale as old as time--
broken heart.

490
00:19:46.853 --> 00:19:48.438
- Aw.
- Oh.

491
00:19:48.438 --> 00:19:51.191
Yeah. he had this relationship
and it went on far too long.

492
00:19:51.191 --> 00:19:52.817
and then he just kept trying.
kept trying.

493
00:19:52.817 --> 00:19:54.235
and then she moved away.

494
00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:56.279
and then they tried to do
the long-distance thing.

495
00:19:56.279 --> 00:19:58.490
Oh. I know
how that situation goes.

496
00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:00.367
Exactly.

497
00:20:00.367 --> 00:20:02.577
So. Paolo went down there
for business.

498
00:20:02.577 --> 00:20:04.120
they reconnected.

499
00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.373
and Matteo was ready
for a career change.

500
00:20:06.373 --> 00:20:09.042
and Paolo's delighted.

501
00:20:10.335 --> 00:20:11.711
You know how he is
about family.

502
00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:12.545
- Aw.
- Yeah.

503
00:20:12.545 --> 00:20:13.755
Of course.

504
00:20:13.755 --> 00:20:16.216
Wait a second.
Is that your five-year plan?

505
00:20:16.216 --> 00:20:18.218
Yes. Yes. it is.

506
00:20:18.218 --> 00:20:19.552
Of course.
I still keep it.

507
00:20:19.552 --> 00:20:21.388
I just revise it
every five years.

508
00:20:21.388 --> 00:20:23.181
Do you know what I think
is the funniest thing

509
00:20:23.181 --> 00:20:24.391
about your five-year plan?

510
00:20:24.391 --> 00:20:26.685
Uh. are you going to say
"everything"?

511
00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:30.563
Yes. actually. you're right--
it's everything.

512
00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:32.232
But. really.

513
00:20:32.232 --> 00:20:33.692
the funniest thing is...

514
00:20:33.692 --> 00:20:34.859
that the best thing
that ever happened to you--

515
00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:36.403
meeting and falling in love
with Paolo--

516
00:20:36.403 --> 00:20:37.779
isn't even on your list!

517
00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:39.114
Yes. it is.

518
00:20:39.114 --> 00:20:41.199
Oh. yeah. He added it
and didn't tell me.

519
00:20:41.199 --> 00:20:42.283
- Let me read it to you.
- What?

520
00:20:42.283 --> 00:20:43.284
Wait. I love this!

521
00:20:43.284 --> 00:20:44.411
I found it. yeah.

522
00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:46.621
Here we go.

523
00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:50.333
Ahem.

524
00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:52.836
"Meet a dashing
and exotic Italian--"

525
00:20:52.836 --> 00:20:54.129
Oh!

526
00:20:54.129 --> 00:20:55.755
"...Who sweeps me off my feet

527
00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:58.675
and makes me forget
other men even exist."

528
00:20:59.718 --> 00:21:00.927
Can you even?

529
00:21:00.927 --> 00:21:02.512
I mean...

530
00:21:02.512 --> 00:21:03.471
I just...

531
00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:04.222
What?

532
00:21:04.222 --> 00:21:05.807
Just this!

533
00:21:05.807 --> 00:21:07.017
It just makes me so happy.

534
00:21:07.017 --> 00:21:09.019
It reminds me of
the good old days. you know?

535
00:21:09.019 --> 00:21:10.645
We were in college.
and we were just sitting around.

536
00:21:10.645 --> 00:21:12.105
in our jammies.

537
00:21:12.105 --> 00:21:14.315
Except remember. we would
make those brownies in a mug?

538
00:21:14.315 --> 00:21:15.275
- Oh...
- Oh. yes.

539
00:21:15.275 --> 00:21:16.192
Oh. the best.

540
00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:16.985
Here. give me my phone.

541
00:21:16.985 --> 00:21:18.194
Mm.

542
00:21:18.194 --> 00:21:19.279
Selfie!

543
00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:20.238
- Oh.
- Come in tight.

544
00:21:20.238 --> 00:21:21.239
Okay.

545
00:21:21.239 --> 00:21:22.532
Everyone say "brownies".

546
00:21:22.532 --> 00:21:23.950
Okay. Of course.

547
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.243
One. two. three--

548
00:21:25.243 --> 00:21:26.911
Brownies!

549
00:21:28.413 --> 00:21:30.123
Oh. I love that.
Send that one to us.

550
00:21:30.123 --> 00:21:31.458
Aw.

551
00:21:31.458 --> 00:21:32.959
I think
I might actually have

552
00:21:32.959 --> 00:21:34.669
some brownie mix

553
00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:35.795
in my pantry

554
00:21:35.795 --> 00:21:36.963
right now.

555
00:21:48.683 --> 00:21:50.435
Good morning.
Any news yet?

556
00:21:50.435 --> 00:21:52.854
<i>They did a procedure...</i>

557
00:21:52.854 --> 00:21:54.981
and now he's resting.

558
00:21:54.981 --> 00:21:56.399
<i>We'll know more soon.</i>

559
00:21:56.399 --> 00:21:57.817
I'm so sorry.

560
00:21:57.817 --> 00:21:59.819
I really wish
I could be there with you.

561
00:21:59.819 --> 00:22:01.363
Me too.

562
00:22:02.864 --> 00:22:04.949
So... how are you?

563
00:22:04.949 --> 00:22:06.368
Good.

564
00:22:06.368 --> 00:22:08.453
Tracy and Avery just left
for O'Hare this morning.

565
00:22:08.453 --> 00:22:10.705
I'm gonna go down
to the shop

566
00:22:10.705 --> 00:22:12.707
<i>this afternoon.
check on Matteo.</i>

567
00:22:12.707 --> 00:22:13.667
Thanks.

568
00:22:13.667 --> 00:22:15.877
And right now.
in your honor.

569
00:22:15.877 --> 00:22:19.798
I am doing absolutely nothing
other than enjoying my coffee.

570
00:22:19.798 --> 00:22:21.341
I'm proud of you.

571
00:22:25.679 --> 00:22:26.846
I-I--

572
00:22:26.846 --> 00:22:28.515
I agree.

573
00:22:31.059 --> 00:22:33.019
Yeah. I feel--
I feel the same.

574
00:22:33.019 --> 00:22:35.063
Thank you.
Next time.

575
00:22:37.649 --> 00:22:40.193
Nancy sits in these meetings
all day.

576
00:22:40.193 --> 00:22:41.653
every day.

577
00:22:41.653 --> 00:22:43.822
I don't know
how she does it.

578
00:22:43.822 --> 00:22:47.200
15 minutes in. I feel my soul
start to leave my body.

579
00:22:48.326 --> 00:22:50.036
Thank you for coming last night.

580
00:22:50.036 --> 00:22:51.246
Of course.

581
00:22:51.246 --> 00:22:53.206
It was actually a lot of fun.

582
00:22:53.206 --> 00:22:54.332
and now I can cross

583
00:22:54.332 --> 00:22:55.959
"Attend the grand opening
of a lace store"

584
00:22:55.959 --> 00:22:58.461
off my bucket list.

585
00:22:58.461 --> 00:23:00.505
Actually. the lace
is kinda cool. isn't it?

586
00:23:00.505 --> 00:23:02.424
It really was.

587
00:23:02.424 --> 00:23:03.883
I mean. it was a good--

588
00:23:03.883 --> 00:23:05.093
what are you...

589
00:23:05.093 --> 00:23:06.720
what are you doing?

590
00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.388
Oh. you just got
a little Charlotte over here.

591
00:23:08.388 --> 00:23:09.806
She's a beauty.

592
00:23:09.806 --> 00:23:11.141
A "Charlotte"?

593
00:23:11.141 --> 00:23:12.726
- Yeah. a spider.
- A spider?

594
00:23:12.726 --> 00:23:13.643
Okay.

595
00:23:13.643 --> 00:23:15.687
Uh. how-- how big is it?

596
00:23:15.687 --> 00:23:18.106
- She's substantial.
- Substantial!

597
00:23:18.106 --> 00:23:20.567
Oh! Uh... uh...

598
00:23:20.567 --> 00:23:21.776
What are you-- What are you--

599
00:23:21.776 --> 00:23:23.403
What are you doing with it--
her?

600
00:23:23.403 --> 00:23:25.405
Just taking a little video.

601
00:23:25.405 --> 00:23:27.949
Whoa!
She's not dangerous.

602
00:23:27.949 --> 00:23:29.868
You know. spiders...

603
00:23:29.868 --> 00:23:31.828
they're just
not really my favorite.

604
00:23:31.828 --> 00:23:33.997
Okay. do you want me
to relocate her

605
00:23:33.997 --> 00:23:35.832
to some place
that's a little more...

606
00:23:35.832 --> 00:23:37.042
not your office?

607
00:23:37.042 --> 00:23:38.293
Mm-hmm. That's exactly--
- Okay. yeah. got it.

608
00:23:38.293 --> 00:23:39.669
...What I'd like.
That would be wonderful.

609
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:41.504
and I think right now would be
a great time to take

610
00:23:41.504 --> 00:23:43.423
a quick. spontaneous visit
over to the lace shop

611
00:23:43.423 --> 00:23:44.883
to see how Matteo's doing.

612
00:23:44.883 --> 00:23:46.426
- Do you want some company?
- So. I'm just...

613
00:23:46.426 --> 00:23:48.470
That would be wonderful. yes!

614
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:51.848
Once you get the spider
just out of the office--

615
00:23:51.848 --> 00:23:53.183
Where did you--
What? What's going on?

616
00:23:53.183 --> 00:23:54.225
Um...

617
00:23:54.225 --> 00:23:56.311
Charlotte has gone rogue.

618
00:23:56.311 --> 00:23:57.562
Rogue?

619
00:23:57.562 --> 00:23:58.897
Yeah. I don't know
where she is.

620
00:23:58.897 --> 00:24:00.065
And I'm out!

621
00:24:00.065 --> 00:24:01.232
Oh. come on!
She's just a little spider!

622
00:24:01.232 --> 00:24:02.942
She's more afraid of you
than you are of...

623
00:24:02.942 --> 00:24:04.277
ah. well.

624
00:24:04.277 --> 00:24:07.739
I guess that last part's
not actually true.

625
00:24:10.658 --> 00:24:12.035
I think that's a...

626
00:24:12.035 --> 00:24:13.078
Here. let me.

627
00:24:13.078 --> 00:24:15.538
Thank you.

628
00:24:19.376 --> 00:24:20.418
Oh.

629
00:24:20.418 --> 00:24:22.671
Hey.

630
00:24:24.047 --> 00:24:26.424
- Hi.
- Yup.

631
00:24:26.424 --> 00:24:28.968
So. I-- I told them
not to touch the veil.

632
00:24:28.968 --> 00:24:30.095
Is that the right call?

633
00:24:30.095 --> 00:24:31.554
Oh. 100% the right call. but--

634
00:24:31.554 --> 00:24:33.014
- Okay.
- ...Who are they?

635
00:24:33.014 --> 00:24:34.724
I don't know.

636
00:24:34.724 --> 00:24:36.685
It's just been a constant stream
of people all day.

637
00:24:36.685 --> 00:24:38.103
Everybody wants
to see the veil.

638
00:24:38.103 --> 00:24:40.814
Do you think we should
move it somewhere more secure?

639
00:24:40.814 --> 00:24:42.607
No. I don't think so.
They've been really respectful.

640
00:24:42.607 --> 00:24:44.442
I am so confused.

641
00:24:44.442 --> 00:24:46.569
How do they know
about the veil?

642
00:24:46.569 --> 00:24:50.365
Uh. somebody mentioned
something about a video online.

643
00:24:50.365 --> 00:24:51.950
I was gonna check it out
later tonight.

644
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:54.619
Video? What vid--

645
00:24:56.287 --> 00:24:58.164
Lily?

646
00:24:58.164 --> 00:24:59.207
Hmm?

647
00:24:59.207 --> 00:25:00.959
What video?

648
00:25:00.959 --> 00:25:03.586
It's her.

649
00:25:03.586 --> 00:25:06.339
It's "Everyone's
Favorite Art Historian"!

650
00:25:11.761 --> 00:25:14.264
Everyone's Favorite... what?

651
00:25:17.267 --> 00:25:18.560
Wh...

652
00:25:22.814 --> 00:25:25.275
<i>...Anyone who is
in possession of this veil</i>

653
00:25:25.275 --> 00:25:26.985
<i>will find true love.</i>

654
00:25:26.985 --> 00:25:28.528
Don't be mad.

655
00:25:28.528 --> 00:25:30.822
I'm not mad. but...

656
00:25:30.822 --> 00:25:33.408
"Everyone's Favorite
Art Historian"?

657
00:25:33.408 --> 00:25:34.993
That's just
what they do on there.

658
00:25:34.993 --> 00:25:37.454
There's. like. "Everyone's
Favorite Wafflemaker".

659
00:25:37.454 --> 00:25:39.247
and "Everyone's Favorite
Appliance Repair Woman".

660
00:25:39.247 --> 00:25:40.540
Oh. I follow her!

661
00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:41.958
Did you see that one about.
um. the dishwa--

662
00:25:41.958 --> 00:25:43.168
- The dishwasher pods?
- ...pods? Yes. yes!

663
00:25:43.168 --> 00:25:44.961
- I did. I had no idea.
- I know. me either!

664
00:25:44.961 --> 00:25:47.088
What is "on there"?
What is this on?

665
00:25:47.088 --> 00:25:48.173
Where is this?

666
00:25:48.173 --> 00:25:49.716
Oh. it's called "Clack".

667
00:25:49.716 --> 00:25:52.844
It's an app where
people upload their videos.

668
00:25:52.844 --> 00:25:55.221
So. it's
a new social media platform?

669
00:25:55.221 --> 00:25:56.598
Brand-new.

670
00:25:56.598 --> 00:25:58.641
but the videos
are supposed to be more. um...

671
00:25:58.641 --> 00:25:59.559
what's the word I'm looking for?

672
00:25:59.559 --> 00:26:00.518
Uh. socially redeemable?

673
00:26:00.518 --> 00:26:02.520
"Socially redeemable."

674
00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.315
There's lots of
knowledge sharing and beauty.

675
00:26:05.315 --> 00:26:07.400
Travel tips.
Goofy pet videos.

676
00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.985
Goofy pet videos!

677
00:26:08.985 --> 00:26:12.447
Okay. I'm not mad.
but I'm not comfortable either.

678
00:26:12.447 --> 00:26:14.657
You really should've
asked me first. Lily.

679
00:26:14.657 --> 00:26:16.576
I know. I'm sorry.

680
00:26:16.576 --> 00:26:18.078
But if it helps at all.

681
00:26:18.078 --> 00:26:20.121
it is not on the same channel
as my other videos.

682
00:26:21.623 --> 00:26:22.582
You know. the. uh...

683
00:26:22.582 --> 00:26:24.668
the "Charlotte" ones.

684
00:26:24.668 --> 00:26:25.960
Who's Charlotte?

685
00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:28.380
Uh...

686
00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:29.881
can we take it down?

687
00:26:29.881 --> 00:26:31.883
Sort of.

688
00:26:33.259 --> 00:26:35.553
You have 100.000 views.

689
00:26:35.553 --> 00:26:37.347
100.000 views?

690
00:26:37.347 --> 00:26:38.932
Uh-huh.
And it's been shared.

691
00:26:38.932 --> 00:26:40.266
A lot!

692
00:26:40.266 --> 00:26:42.936
So even if we take it down.
it is... everywhere.

693
00:26:42.936 --> 00:26:43.978
Emma.

694
00:26:43.978 --> 00:26:45.480
this is
just my humble opinion.

695
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.107
but I think you should
leave the video up.

696
00:26:47.107 --> 00:26:49.401
I mean. the opening numbers
were not that great.

697
00:26:49.401 --> 00:26:51.486
and this video
is bringing people in.

698
00:26:51.486 --> 00:26:52.946
They may not be buying anything.

699
00:26:52.946 --> 00:26:54.823
but it's bringing them
into the store.

700
00:26:54.823 --> 00:26:57.784
That gives me an idea.

701
00:26:57.784 --> 00:27:00.453
Everything you have
on the floor right now

702
00:27:00.453 --> 00:27:02.372
is wedding
and expensive items.

703
00:27:02.372 --> 00:27:04.833
to attract the large vendors
and other high-end customers.

704
00:27:04.833 --> 00:27:05.709
right?

705
00:27:05.709 --> 00:27:06.918
Right. yup.

706
00:27:06.918 --> 00:27:08.461
It's our traditional
business model.

707
00:27:08.461 --> 00:27:10.588
I almost sound like I know
what I'm talking about. huh?

708
00:27:10.588 --> 00:27:11.923
I bought it.

709
00:27:11.923 --> 00:27:14.092
Did you see that box
at the warehouse

710
00:27:14.092 --> 00:27:16.928
with the lace barrettes
and the fans...

711
00:27:16.928 --> 00:27:18.263
the small pocket squares
from Italy?

712
00:27:18.263 --> 00:27:19.389
Yeah.

713
00:27:19.389 --> 00:27:20.724
Okay. what if
we set up a display

714
00:27:20.724 --> 00:27:22.475
with just those small items?

715
00:27:22.475 --> 00:27:24.185
Because that's the type of thing

716
00:27:24.185 --> 00:27:26.813
that the walk-in traffic
might actually buy.

717
00:27:26.813 --> 00:27:28.648
A little piece
of the House of Stefano?

718
00:27:28.648 --> 00:27:30.066
That's actually
a really good idea!

719
00:27:30.066 --> 00:27:31.276
Yeah. I like it.

720
00:27:31.276 --> 00:27:32.777
Great.

721
00:27:32.777 --> 00:27:35.530
Well. then.
regarding the video...

722
00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:37.657
I don't love it.

723
00:27:37.657 --> 00:27:40.785
but if it has the potential
to help Paolo.

724
00:27:40.785 --> 00:27:43.455
I am okay
with you leaving it up.

725
00:27:47.083 --> 00:27:47.959
All right.

726
00:27:47.959 --> 00:27:50.211
I'm going to head home...

727
00:27:50.211 --> 00:27:52.047
and I'll see you tomorrow.

728
00:27:52.047 --> 00:27:54.841
- Okay.
-'Kay.

729
00:27:54.841 --> 00:27:57.844
Oh. hey. what was the thing
with the dishwasher pods?

730
00:27:57.844 --> 00:27:59.512
Oh. you don't put 'em
in the detergent thingy.

731
00:27:59.512 --> 00:28:00.847
It gunks it all up.

732
00:28:00.847 --> 00:28:03.183
Yeah. you just put it
in the utensil caddy.

733
00:28:03.183 --> 00:28:04.517
That's a good tip. Hmm.

734
00:28:04.517 --> 00:28:06.186
Call me
if you need anything.

735
00:28:06.186 --> 00:28:09.230
And I am
nobody's favorite art historian.

736
00:28:14.194 --> 00:28:16.071
Well. she's
my favorite art historian.

737
00:28:16.071 --> 00:28:18.073
Yeah. mine too.

738
00:28:20.033 --> 00:28:20.867
All right.

739
00:28:22.452 --> 00:28:24.621
Hey. do you know anything about
setting up a small display?

740
00:28:24.621 --> 00:28:25.830
I do. actually.

741
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:27.374
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

742
00:28:27.374 --> 00:28:28.792
- Follow me.
- Okay.

743
00:28:42.097 --> 00:28:43.348
Hi!

744
00:28:43.348 --> 00:28:45.266
So. what's the latest?

745
00:28:45.266 --> 00:28:48.228
<i>Well. they inserted
some stents.</i>

746
00:28:48.228 --> 00:28:50.438
and he has to take it easy
for a while.

747
00:28:50.438 --> 00:28:51.940
<i>but he's going to be fine.</i>

748
00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.526
Okay. I'm so relieved.

749
00:28:54.526 --> 00:28:57.237
Me too.

750
00:28:57.237 --> 00:28:59.072
<i>Look. I'm going to stay
a few more days</i>

751
00:28:59.072 --> 00:29:00.824
<i>to help Uncle Vittorio. okay?</i>

752
00:29:00.824 --> 00:29:01.991
Yeah. of course.

753
00:29:01.991 --> 00:29:06.121
<i>So. what's going on there?</i>

754
00:29:06.121 --> 00:29:09.582
Well. I can never. ever. ever

755
00:29:09.582 --> 00:29:10.917
go back in my office

756
00:29:10.917 --> 00:29:13.420
because a massive. mutant spider
lives there now.

757
00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:14.713
<i>So. there's that.</i>

758
00:29:14.713 --> 00:29:16.756
Just burn it down!

759
00:29:16.756 --> 00:29:18.758
Yes. that's exactly my plan.

760
00:29:18.758 --> 00:29:21.219
Oh. and I went into
the shop today.

761
00:29:21.219 --> 00:29:24.305
and you are never going to guess
what Lily did.

762
00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:37.861
And he's dating a model...

763
00:29:37.861 --> 00:29:39.571
because. of course. he is.

764
00:29:40.989 --> 00:29:42.615
Awesome.

765
00:30:07.474 --> 00:30:08.808
Whoa!

766
00:30:08.808 --> 00:30:10.935
Why? Why. why. why?
Why are you doing that?

767
00:30:10.935 --> 00:30:13.938
No. no. no!
Stop it! Stop! Stop!

768
00:30:15.357 --> 00:30:17.025
Why are you doing that?

769
00:30:20.487 --> 00:30:22.072
Oh!

770
00:30:24.824 --> 00:30:26.493
Thank you.

771
00:30:26.493 --> 00:30:27.577
For sure.

772
00:30:27.577 --> 00:30:29.579
Oh. just--
oh. pardon me. excuse me.

773
00:30:29.579 --> 00:30:30.622
Emma?

774
00:30:30.622 --> 00:30:31.831
Oh. good morning.

775
00:30:31.831 --> 00:30:33.500
Perfect timing.
Listen. I would like you

776
00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.835
to start coming
to staffing meetings with me.

777
00:30:35.835 --> 00:30:37.837
They can be heated at times.

778
00:30:37.837 --> 00:30:40.340
but I'd rather we both go
together for a while.

779
00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:42.509
and then I can
transition them to you.

780
00:30:42.509 --> 00:30:44.010
Of course. yes.
When are they?

781
00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:45.845
Tuesdays. two to four.

782
00:30:45.845 --> 00:30:48.473
I'm so sorry. I can't do that.
I have a conflict.

783
00:30:48.473 --> 00:30:50.016
That's when my intro class is.

784
00:30:50.016 --> 00:30:51.851
Oh. no. I gave Jason Moore
your intro class

785
00:30:51.851 --> 00:30:54.354
for the rest of the semester.

786
00:30:54.354 --> 00:30:55.647
Uh...

787
00:30:57.107 --> 00:30:59.442
It's just that Jason
teaches right out of the book.

788
00:30:59.442 --> 00:31:01.653
and I promised these kids
that they would--

789
00:31:01.653 --> 00:31:02.821
No. it's a GE class
for most of them.

790
00:31:02.821 --> 00:31:04.114
They'll be fine.

791
00:31:04.114 --> 00:31:05.865
I only have two classes
this semester.

792
00:31:05.865 --> 00:31:06.908
Yes. and once
you're Department Chair.

793
00:31:06.908 --> 00:31:08.368
you won't have any.
Oh. by the way--

794
00:31:08.368 --> 00:31:10.286
they called an impromptu
budget meeting for tonight.

795
00:31:10.286 --> 00:31:11.955
They're bringing dinner in.
Can you stay?

796
00:31:13.123 --> 00:31:14.582
Could I dial in?
I'm supposed to--

797
00:31:14.582 --> 00:31:15.750
I would rather you be there.

798
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:18.044
I need people to see you more

799
00:31:18.044 --> 00:31:20.755
so that they start coming to you
instead of me.

800
00:31:20.755 --> 00:31:22.382
Okay. yeah.
Uh. I can do that.

801
00:31:25.343 --> 00:31:27.262
Good talk.

802
00:31:33.018 --> 00:31:34.394
Thank you for restocking that.

803
00:31:34.394 --> 00:31:36.104
I can't believe how many
of them you've sold already.

804
00:31:36.104 --> 00:31:37.063
So many!

805
00:31:37.063 --> 00:31:38.148
Did you order more?

806
00:31:38.148 --> 00:31:39.315
Yeah. a bunch this morning.

807
00:31:39.315 --> 00:31:40.400
Great.

808
00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.735
Oh. there's Emma.

809
00:31:41.735 --> 00:31:42.861
Hey.

810
00:31:42.861 --> 00:31:44.571
It's so busy.

811
00:31:44.571 --> 00:31:46.156
Right? It's great.

812
00:31:46.156 --> 00:31:48.575
How's the new display doing?

813
00:31:48.575 --> 00:31:50.493
Great.
Thank you for the idea.

814
00:31:50.493 --> 00:31:52.454
I'm so glad.

815
00:31:55.457 --> 00:31:56.958
- Lily...
- Mm-hmm?

816
00:31:56.958 --> 00:31:58.710
The veil doesn't
really work like that.

817
00:31:58.710 --> 00:31:59.878
I think you're safe.

818
00:31:59.878 --> 00:32:02.172
Ha. Respectfully.
you do not know that.

819
00:32:02.172 --> 00:32:04.924
I am very susceptible
to things.

820
00:32:04.924 --> 00:32:06.217
- Okay.
- Excuse me?

821
00:32:07.427 --> 00:32:08.970
- Hi.
- Hi. again.

822
00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:10.597
You talked about
the veil before.

823
00:32:10.597 --> 00:32:12.974
but what is this gown here?

824
00:32:12.974 --> 00:32:15.769
This is actually
my husband's christening gown.

825
00:32:15.769 --> 00:32:18.563
along with several generations
of Di Stefano babies...

826
00:32:18.563 --> 00:32:21.107
but really.
it's so much more than that.

827
00:32:21.107 --> 00:32:23.818
This little gown offered us
an important clue

828
00:32:23.818 --> 00:32:26.071
in understanding
Arianna's story.

829
00:32:26.071 --> 00:32:27.739
If Arianna never had a child.

830
00:32:27.739 --> 00:32:30.825
why would she keep
a Christening gown in her trunk

831
00:32:30.825 --> 00:32:32.619
with her dearest possessions?

832
00:32:34.996 --> 00:32:37.791
This is going on Click
again. isn't it?

833
00:32:37.791 --> 00:32:39.834
"Clack." and yes. it is.

834
00:32:39.834 --> 00:32:41.044
- Lily...
- Keep talking. keep talking.

835
00:32:41.044 --> 00:32:43.672
Keep talking.

836
00:32:43.672 --> 00:32:46.508
Let me show you
this little detail over here...

837
00:32:53.598 --> 00:32:55.642
You're home!

838
00:32:55.642 --> 00:32:56.643
<i>Amore!</i>

839
00:32:56.643 --> 00:32:59.020
What? Hi.

840
00:33:00.855 --> 00:33:02.732
I missed this face.

841
00:33:05.026 --> 00:33:07.821
What happened?
Why are you here?

842
00:33:07.821 --> 00:33:09.572
Uncle Vittorio
has everything in hand.

843
00:33:09.572 --> 00:33:11.700
so I just jumped on a plane.

844
00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:13.660
but I can only stay
a few days.

845
00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:15.537
That's okay.
You're here now.

846
00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:21.126
I swear.
the machine was broken!

847
00:33:21.126 --> 00:33:22.794
You just don't have the touch.

848
00:33:24.004 --> 00:33:26.673
Thank you.

849
00:33:26.673 --> 00:33:28.717
So. how is Papa?

850
00:33:28.717 --> 00:33:30.260
Mm. happy to be home.

851
00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:32.679
but he's taking all of this
a little personally.

852
00:33:32.679 --> 00:33:34.681
I guess finding out
you're not Superman anymore

853
00:33:34.681 --> 00:33:36.182
can be humbling.

854
00:33:36.182 --> 00:33:37.100
Mm.

855
00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:39.019
You know what?

856
00:33:39.019 --> 00:33:40.603
I stopped by
the glass store.

857
00:33:40.603 --> 00:33:42.439
Your mirror is still there.

858
00:33:42.439 --> 00:33:44.858
and the shop owner asked me
how many children we have now.

859
00:33:44.858 --> 00:33:45.942
No. he didn't!

860
00:33:45.942 --> 00:33:47.068
He did!

861
00:33:47.068 --> 00:33:48.403
And he's holding that mirror
for you

862
00:33:48.403 --> 00:33:49.946
because you loved it so much.

863
00:33:49.946 --> 00:33:51.698
It's meant to be.

864
00:33:51.698 --> 00:33:53.158
Oh... okay.

865
00:33:53.158 --> 00:33:54.826
Well. maybe we can
sell the house.

866
00:33:54.826 --> 00:33:57.078
and use the money to cover
the cost of shipping it here.

867
00:33:57.078 --> 00:33:58.872
That's impressive
financial planning.

868
00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.000
<i>Piccolino.</i>

869
00:34:10.008 --> 00:34:12.135
I'm so glad
that Paolo is back.

870
00:34:12.135 --> 00:34:14.888
Matteo has a stack
of questions saved up.

871
00:34:16.056 --> 00:34:19.017
So. are you and Matteo
becoming friends?

872
00:34:19.017 --> 00:34:21.311
Friends? Sure.

873
00:34:21.311 --> 00:34:23.021
What you are thinking-- no.

874
00:34:23.021 --> 00:34:24.397
I didn't say a word.

875
00:34:24.397 --> 00:34:27.233
Yeah. but you thought it.
and I can read your mind.

876
00:34:27.233 --> 00:34:29.569
It's just that you guys
were standing right by the veil.

877
00:34:29.569 --> 00:34:31.029
Ah! Ba-ba-ba-- no!

878
00:34:31.029 --> 00:34:32.614
Don't-- Don't--
Don't do that. please.

879
00:34:32.614 --> 00:34:33.823
Okay. okay.

880
00:34:33.823 --> 00:34:35.325
Let me just ask you
one question.

881
00:34:35.325 --> 00:34:37.160
and then you can
tell me to back off.

882
00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:38.953
Is Matteo your type?

883
00:34:38.953 --> 00:34:40.497
Oh...

884
00:34:40.497 --> 00:34:43.458
is the handsome. hardworking.
funny guy

885
00:34:43.458 --> 00:34:45.418
with the model girlfriend
my "type". is that really--

886
00:34:45.418 --> 00:34:47.587
She's not his girlfriend anymore.

887
00:34:48.922 --> 00:34:50.674
Okay. Emma... ha.

888
00:34:50.674 --> 00:34:52.801
I make videos of cool bugs.

889
00:34:52.801 --> 00:34:54.678
I change my own oil.

890
00:34:54.678 --> 00:34:56.262
I climb on rocks.

891
00:34:56.262 --> 00:34:59.766
I'm collecting clips
of "cool moss" patterns.

892
00:34:59.766 --> 00:35:00.975
Wow.

893
00:35:00.975 --> 00:35:02.394
Yeah. I walk
in this park every day

894
00:35:02.394 --> 00:35:03.770
just to feel the grass.

895
00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:05.563
and I like myself just fine.

896
00:35:05.563 --> 00:35:07.273
but I also know

897
00:35:07.273 --> 00:35:08.942
that men don't always...

898
00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:13.488
Well. let's just say
I'm not usually attractive

899
00:35:13.488 --> 00:35:17.367
to the type of men
who likes women who ask them...

900
00:35:17.367 --> 00:35:19.452
what shade of cotton-candy
pink nail polish

901
00:35:19.452 --> 00:35:21.913
goes best
with their Gucci bag.

902
00:35:21.913 --> 00:35:25.125
I think you might be making
some assumptions about Matteo.

903
00:35:25.125 --> 00:35:26.084
And I think you might be
making some assumptions

904
00:35:26.084 --> 00:35:27.210
about my dating life.

905
00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:28.795
It hasn't been painless.

906
00:35:28.795 --> 00:35:29.963
I'm sorry.

907
00:35:29.963 --> 00:35:32.215
I just think you're amazing.

908
00:35:32.215 --> 00:35:33.842
And any guy would be lucky
to date you.

909
00:35:33.842 --> 00:35:35.635
Okay. thank you.

910
00:35:35.635 --> 00:35:37.137
You're very kind-- heh--

911
00:35:37.137 --> 00:35:38.304
and because you are so kind.

912
00:35:38.304 --> 00:35:39.848
now is probably a good time
to tell you

913
00:35:39.848 --> 00:35:41.641
that I read your article on
the veil and I didn't like it.

914
00:35:42.892 --> 00:35:45.061
Wha--?
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa!

915
00:35:45.061 --> 00:35:46.354
- What?
- Huh?

916
00:35:46.354 --> 00:35:47.480
What?

917
00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:48.982
Uh. I read your article
on the veil

918
00:35:48.982 --> 00:35:50.567
and I did not like it.

919
00:35:50.567 --> 00:35:52.110
No. no. no. I heard you. but
what's-- what's wrong with it?

920
00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:55.947
Um... it's fine.

921
00:35:55.947 --> 00:35:58.199
You know. it's...
it's full of facts.

922
00:35:58.199 --> 00:36:00.785
so that's... good.

923
00:36:00.785 --> 00:36:02.537
"Fine." factual.
and "good"?

924
00:36:02.537 --> 00:36:03.538
- Uh-huh.
- Wow.

925
00:36:05.206 --> 00:36:07.667
Well. you know. um.

926
00:36:07.667 --> 00:36:09.961
the history of the veil is more
than just names and dates.

927
00:36:09.961 --> 00:36:12.505
It's more than
just a list of facts.

928
00:36:12.505 --> 00:36:13.715
Yeah.

929
00:36:13.715 --> 00:36:15.800
Have you read the comments
on your videos?

930
00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:18.928
No. There is no joy to be found
in Internet comment sections.

931
00:36:18.928 --> 00:36:20.513
Okay. normally.
that is very true.

932
00:36:20.513 --> 00:36:23.683
but just this once.
I think you should.

933
00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:27.354
Look. I know about
"publish or perish."

934
00:36:27.354 --> 00:36:29.689
and I know that you really want
this Chair position.

935
00:36:29.689 --> 00:36:32.275
but Emma. when you are
out there doing your own thing.

936
00:36:32.275 --> 00:36:34.319
bringing your passion...

937
00:36:34.319 --> 00:36:36.529
that is how you engage people
in the history of art.

938
00:36:36.529 --> 00:36:38.865
Yeah. but that's not
how the university works.

939
00:36:38.865 --> 00:36:40.992
I know.

940
00:36:40.992 --> 00:36:42.202
and for the record.

941
00:36:42.202 --> 00:36:43.370
I do not like TA'ing
for Professor Moore--

942
00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:45.538
your intro class
is miserable now.

943
00:36:45.538 --> 00:36:46.539
Great.

944
00:36:46.539 --> 00:36:48.041
Okay. well...

945
00:36:48.041 --> 00:36:51.294
aside from that one really
bad typo on the first page.

946
00:36:51.294 --> 00:36:52.921
your article's fine.

947
00:36:54.297 --> 00:36:56.216
What?
What really bad typo?

948
00:36:56.216 --> 00:36:58.468
You misspelled "veil".

949
00:37:02.138 --> 00:37:03.765
Good meeting. everyone.
Thank you.

950
00:37:06.893 --> 00:37:08.228
Ahem.

951
00:37:08.228 --> 00:37:09.896
How's the article coming?

952
00:37:09.896 --> 00:37:11.189
Oh! Uh...

953
00:37:11.189 --> 00:37:14.234
well. I'm just in the middle
of an edit.

954
00:37:14.234 --> 00:37:16.736
so I'll have a first draft
over to you soon.

955
00:37:16.736 --> 00:37:19.572
Do you have time to. um. go over
the curriculum for next--

956
00:37:19.572 --> 00:37:21.032
No. not right now.

957
00:37:21.032 --> 00:37:26.079
Um. some of the students told me
about a video of you...

958
00:37:26.079 --> 00:37:27.914
so I asked them to show me.

959
00:37:27.914 --> 00:37:29.457
You were in the lace store

960
00:37:29.457 --> 00:37:31.918
talking about the history
of a wedding veil.

961
00:37:31.918 --> 00:37:34.379
That's right.

962
00:37:34.379 --> 00:37:36.381
I'd like you to stop
making these kinds of videos.

963
00:37:36.381 --> 00:37:37.799
Any videos. really.

964
00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:41.511
It's not against
university policy.

965
00:37:41.511 --> 00:37:43.346
No. I just don't like them.

966
00:37:43.346 --> 00:37:45.682
It's simply not what we do
in this department.

967
00:37:45.682 --> 00:37:47.392
If you have
something else to say.

968
00:37:47.392 --> 00:37:49.644
write another article.

969
00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:57.444
And she doesn't own you.

970
00:37:57.444 --> 00:38:00.071
The university
can't tell you what to do.

971
00:38:00.071 --> 00:38:01.531
Actually. they can.

972
00:38:01.531 --> 00:38:03.283
I mean.
in certain circumstances.

973
00:38:03.283 --> 00:38:04.617
but not this.

974
00:38:04.617 --> 00:38:06.494
They-- They love videos. documentaries.

975
00:38:06.494 --> 00:38:07.537
that sort of thing.

976
00:38:07.537 --> 00:38:08.663
This is--

977
00:38:08.663 --> 00:38:11.458
this is Nancy's reluctance
to change.

978
00:38:11.458 --> 00:38:14.127
Emma. I have something
important to ask you.

979
00:38:14.127 --> 00:38:17.756
Okay. I'll marry you. Again.

980
00:38:20.842 --> 00:38:22.469
Sorry.

981
00:38:22.469 --> 00:38:24.763
What-- What-- What's up?

982
00:38:24.763 --> 00:38:27.515
You know Nancy's
never going to retire. right?

983
00:38:27.515 --> 00:38:29.351
She's going to pass away
sitting at her desk

984
00:38:29.351 --> 00:38:31.644
when she's 110 years old.

985
00:38:31.644 --> 00:38:34.481
No. This is her final semester.

986
00:38:34.481 --> 00:38:36.691
I even had to give up
my intro class

987
00:38:36.691 --> 00:38:38.318
because she passed
another meeting to me.

988
00:38:38.318 --> 00:38:41.905
so. it's-- it's happening.

989
00:38:41.905 --> 00:38:43.656
But do you love it?

990
00:38:43.656 --> 00:38:45.825
I did not love
giving up my intro class.

991
00:38:45.825 --> 00:38:47.702
No. but--

992
00:38:47.702 --> 00:38:49.204
I mean all of it.

993
00:38:49.204 --> 00:38:51.498
You don't seem
to love it anymore.

994
00:38:51.498 --> 00:38:53.124
What if you walked away?

995
00:38:53.124 --> 00:38:55.877
Went somewhere else?

996
00:38:55.877 --> 00:38:58.046
Why would I do that?

997
00:38:58.046 --> 00:39:02.050
I've worked so long to get here.
and now I'm almost there.

998
00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:03.009
so why would I go
somewhere else?

999
00:39:03.009 --> 00:39:04.135
Where would I go?
I...

1000
00:39:08.014 --> 00:39:09.474
Italy.

1001
00:39:09.474 --> 00:39:11.476
Emma. I-- I'm sure
Natalia would love

1002
00:39:11.476 --> 00:39:13.186
to have you back
at the university.

1003
00:39:13.186 --> 00:39:15.689
and you loved
teaching in Italy.

1004
00:39:15.689 --> 00:39:16.981
Or no?

1005
00:39:16.981 --> 00:39:18.233
Paolo...

1006
00:39:18.233 --> 00:39:21.027
what is this really about?

1007
00:39:21.027 --> 00:39:22.570
Emma...

1008
00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:24.572
Papa's heart problem

1009
00:39:24.572 --> 00:39:27.450
was a wake-up call
for Uncle Vittorio.

1010
00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:28.952
He asked to work part-time

1011
00:39:28.952 --> 00:39:31.162
in a position
that allows him to travel.

1012
00:39:31.162 --> 00:39:33.039
That's wonderful.

1013
00:39:33.039 --> 00:39:35.166
I think that's wonderful. but...

1014
00:39:35.166 --> 00:39:36.876
Emma...

1015
00:39:36.876 --> 00:39:39.546
give me your hand.

1016
00:39:39.546 --> 00:39:41.798
Papa needs to retire.

1017
00:39:43.091 --> 00:39:44.801
And if Papa retires.

1018
00:39:44.801 --> 00:39:47.095
and Uncle Vittorio
semi-retires...

1019
00:39:47.095 --> 00:39:49.097
someone has to run the business.

1020
00:39:49.097 --> 00:39:50.682
and that's me.

1021
00:39:50.682 --> 00:39:53.518
and I cannot do that
from Chicago.

1022
00:39:53.518 --> 00:39:56.271
I have to move back to Italy

1023
00:39:56.271 --> 00:39:58.148
and take over
the family business.

1024
00:39:58.148 --> 00:39:59.983
or...

1025
00:39:59.983 --> 00:40:01.818
we will have to sell it all.

1026
00:40:04.612 --> 00:40:08.324
But there has to be
someone else.

1027
00:40:08.324 --> 00:40:10.035
What about Sophia?

1028
00:40:10.035 --> 00:40:11.286
She's already picking up

1029
00:40:11.286 --> 00:40:13.455
Uncle Vittorio's
marketing responsibilities.

1030
00:40:13.455 --> 00:40:15.832
There's no one else.

1031
00:40:20.879 --> 00:40:22.964
It's only me.

1032
00:40:33.224 --> 00:40:36.686
Well. that's a much bigger
suitcase than last time.

1033
00:40:38.355 --> 00:40:40.315
Two weeks.

1034
00:40:40.315 --> 00:40:42.150
Three at the most.

1035
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:44.319
I will talk to them.
I promise.

1036
00:40:44.319 --> 00:40:47.113
Maybe I can split my time.

1037
00:40:47.113 --> 00:40:50.450
It's just that I did
long-distance once before.

1038
00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:52.160
and it did not
go well for me.

1039
00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.204
I know.

1040
00:40:55.663 --> 00:40:59.042
But he was
the wrong man.

1041
00:40:59.042 --> 00:41:00.919
We will figure this out.

1042
00:41:00.919 --> 00:41:02.545
Okay?

1043
00:41:03.421 --> 00:41:05.298
Okay.

1044
00:41:06.257 --> 00:41:08.218
Yes?

1045
00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:22.315
I have to go.

1046
00:41:22.315 --> 00:41:24.275
I know.

1047
00:41:26.361 --> 00:41:28.071
<i>Ciao.</i>

1048
00:41:41.835 --> 00:41:44.713
So. did you guys talk about
moving back to Italy again?

1049
00:41:44.713 --> 00:41:46.172
<i>Not really.</i>

1050
00:41:46.172 --> 00:41:49.676
I-- I assumed we would.
but years in the future.

1051
00:41:49.676 --> 00:41:52.470
after we've raised the children
we don't even have yet.

1052
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:53.722
<i>I don't know.</i>

1053
00:41:53.722 --> 00:41:54.931
<i>I don't really know
how to solve this.</i>

1054
00:41:54.931 --> 00:41:56.391
You'll figure it out.

1055
00:41:56.391 --> 00:41:59.185
<i>You know you are "Everyone's
Favorite Art Historian."</i>

1056
00:42:00.437 --> 00:42:03.064
Okay. so you saw
the videos?

1057
00:42:03.064 --> 00:42:04.441
<i>Of course!</i>

1058
00:42:04.441 --> 00:42:05.608
We love them.

1059
00:42:05.608 --> 00:42:08.445
You are just a natural teacher.

1060
00:42:08.445 --> 00:42:10.196
And I know you think
being Department Chair

1061
00:42:10.196 --> 00:42:12.073
is the right path. but...

1062
00:42:13.533 --> 00:42:16.828
Speaking of--
Nancy's on the other line.

1063
00:42:16.828 --> 00:42:18.079
Okay. call us back tonight.

1064
00:42:18.079 --> 00:42:19.247
Okay. Love you.

1065
00:42:19.247 --> 00:42:20.081
Love you.

1066
00:42:22.459 --> 00:42:24.377
Good morning. Nancy.

1067
00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:34.763
Um...

1068
00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:43.646
Hi! Welcome
to the House of Stefano.

1069
00:42:43.646 --> 00:42:45.023
How can I help you?

1070
00:42:45.023 --> 00:42:46.566
Wow. that's a beautiful piece
that you've chosen.

1071
00:42:49.319 --> 00:42:50.779
Bye!

1072
00:42:51.988 --> 00:42:53.615
- Whew!
- Whoo.

1073
00:42:53.615 --> 00:42:55.283
That was over the top.

1074
00:42:55.283 --> 00:42:56.409
Thank you.

1075
00:42:56.409 --> 00:42:57.619
Of course.

1076
00:42:57.619 --> 00:42:59.329
You know. I came here
just to see

1077
00:42:59.329 --> 00:43:00.497
if I forgot
my sunglasses here.

1078
00:43:00.497 --> 00:43:01.623
That was four hours ago.

1079
00:43:01.623 --> 00:43:02.832
Yeah. but you were busy.

1080
00:43:02.832 --> 00:43:04.000
and that wasn't
just the small stuff.

1081
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.586
I sold two shawls
and a tablecloth!

1082
00:43:06.586 --> 00:43:07.796
Yes. you did.

1083
00:43:11.383 --> 00:43:13.385
How do you know
how to do that?

1084
00:43:13.385 --> 00:43:14.886
Do what?

1085
00:43:14.886 --> 00:43:16.763
Just jump in with customers

1086
00:43:16.763 --> 00:43:19.474
when you don't know
anything about lace?

1087
00:43:19.474 --> 00:43:21.017
My parents have
a hardware store.

1088
00:43:21.017 --> 00:43:24.479
One of those local shops
that has literally everything.

1089
00:43:24.479 --> 00:43:25.605
if you know where to look.

1090
00:43:25.605 --> 00:43:27.482
...I love places like that.
- Yeah.

1091
00:43:27.482 --> 00:43:29.275
So. what. you were
like the free labor?

1092
00:43:29.275 --> 00:43:33.238
Yeah! All of us were.
I'm the youngest of four.

1093
00:43:33.238 --> 00:43:34.489
You get really good

1094
00:43:34.489 --> 00:43:36.449
at working with the public
really young.

1095
00:43:36.449 --> 00:43:39.911
so. I guess customer service
is just customer service.

1096
00:43:39.911 --> 00:43:42.706
whether it's lace
or hex nuts.

1097
00:43:44.457 --> 00:43:45.750
I know.

1098
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:47.460
What do you got?

1099
00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:49.754
These. and these.

1100
00:43:49.754 --> 00:43:51.548
Okay! So. these are mine--

1101
00:43:51.548 --> 00:43:52.716
- Okay.
- But. fun fact--

1102
00:43:52.716 --> 00:43:54.134
...I like these better.

1103
00:43:54.134 --> 00:43:55.301
- Really?
- Yes.

1104
00:43:55.301 --> 00:43:56.344
Well. I'll tell you what.

1105
00:43:56.344 --> 00:43:57.887
Mm-hmm?

1106
00:43:57.887 --> 00:43:59.806
You come back in a month.
if nobody else has claimed them.

1107
00:43:59.806 --> 00:44:02.392
these bad boys
are yours.

1108
00:44:02.392 --> 00:44:03.852
Oh. ho! Okay.

1109
00:44:03.852 --> 00:44:05.562
That works for me.
Thank you.

1110
00:44:05.562 --> 00:44:06.730
Great.

1111
00:44:07.731 --> 00:44:09.607
Oh. here. let me.

1112
00:44:09.607 --> 00:44:11.735
Ahem. Okay.

1113
00:44:14.696 --> 00:44:17.532
There you go.

1114
00:44:17.532 --> 00:44:18.324
Oh. your...

1115
00:44:18.324 --> 00:44:20.452
here.

1116
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.085
Okay. Bye.

1117
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:34.215
Lily?

1118
00:44:34.215 --> 00:44:36.384
Yeah. hi. Oh! Hi.

1119
00:44:36.384 --> 00:44:38.053
Look. I know you're joking

1120
00:44:38.053 --> 00:44:40.263
with the whole
trying-to-avoid-the-veil thing.

1121
00:44:40.263 --> 00:44:42.265
but be honest.

1122
00:44:42.265 --> 00:44:43.600
Do you think there's any--

1123
00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:46.269
Do I think it's really
a magical talisman?

1124
00:44:47.395 --> 00:44:49.272
Yeah. something like that.

1125
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:53.610
Well...

1126
00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:57.864
Matteo. I think
that life is cruel...

1127
00:44:57.864 --> 00:45:00.367
and difficult...

1128
00:45:00.367 --> 00:45:02.410
Yeah.

1129
00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:08.041
But I also think
there's beauty...

1130
00:45:08.041 --> 00:45:09.376
and love

1131
00:45:09.376 --> 00:45:12.003
and magic all around us.

1132
00:45:12.003 --> 00:45:15.465
if we just take a second
to see it.

1133
00:45:17.092 --> 00:45:20.553
This veil
was just sitting in a shop

1134
00:45:20.553 --> 00:45:22.347
before Emma
and her friends saw it.

1135
00:45:22.347 --> 00:45:23.556
and because they saw it.

1136
00:45:23.556 --> 00:45:26.893
the grace of it
flows through their lives.

1137
00:45:29.145 --> 00:45:30.855
So...

1138
00:45:30.855 --> 00:45:32.565
you can call that magic.

1139
00:45:32.565 --> 00:45:34.943
or... enchantment.

1140
00:45:34.943 --> 00:45:38.071
or mysticism. or...

1141
00:45:39.072 --> 00:45:41.032
...the power of suggestion.

1142
00:45:41.032 --> 00:45:43.827
or even
a freakishly coincidental

1143
00:45:43.827 --> 00:45:46.287
string of good luck.

1144
00:45:46.287 --> 00:45:47.956
but...

1145
00:45:47.956 --> 00:45:49.791
I prefer to think of it

1146
00:45:49.791 --> 00:45:52.335
as the universe
righting itself...

1147
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:55.839
...when you least expect it to.

1148
00:46:00.135 --> 00:46:02.637
And that's probably way more
than you wanted to hear.

1149
00:46:03.722 --> 00:46:05.807
Um. so. why don't you
unlock the door.

1150
00:46:05.807 --> 00:46:08.560
and let me out of
this lace palace?

1151
00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:09.519
Sure.

1152
00:46:11.688 --> 00:46:13.356
Absolutely.

1153
00:46:15.233 --> 00:46:17.193
What. are you not leaving. too?

1154
00:46:17.193 --> 00:46:20.572
No. I. uh. I-I've been
packing up the veil at night

1155
00:46:20.572 --> 00:46:22.198
and taking it home
for safe-keeping.

1156
00:46:22.198 --> 00:46:24.409
just 'cause some of the folks
have been getting...

1157
00:46:24.409 --> 00:46:25.452
Overly enthusiastic?

1158
00:46:25.452 --> 00:46:26.369
Yeah.

1159
00:46:27.746 --> 00:46:30.623
Well. that's... smart.

1160
00:46:30.623 --> 00:46:33.335
Okay. Well. good night.

1161
00:46:33.335 --> 00:46:34.753
Lily--?

1162
00:46:34.753 --> 00:46:36.880
Yeah. hi.

1163
00:46:39.382 --> 00:46:41.134
There's this restaurant

1164
00:46:41.134 --> 00:46:42.677
that just opened up
down the street.

1165
00:46:42.677 --> 00:46:44.346
and they claim to have
better Cubanos

1166
00:46:44.346 --> 00:46:45.805
than they have in Miami.

1167
00:46:45.805 --> 00:46:48.016
Mm. that sounds like
a suspicious claim.

1168
00:46:48.016 --> 00:46:49.434
- Right?
- Yeah.

1169
00:46:49.434 --> 00:46:50.602
So. I was gonna go this week

1170
00:46:50.602 --> 00:46:51.811
and see if they could
back it up.

1171
00:46:51.811 --> 00:46:53.938
and I'm wondering if. um...

1172
00:46:53.938 --> 00:46:55.899
you'd like to come with me?

1173
00:46:58.526 --> 00:47:00.278
Okay.

1174
00:47:00.278 --> 00:47:01.488
Sure.

1175
00:47:01.488 --> 00:47:03.198
Okay!

1176
00:47:03.198 --> 00:47:04.366
Okay.

1177
00:47:04.366 --> 00:47:05.617
Cool.

1178
00:47:05.617 --> 00:47:06.826
Well. have a good night.

1179
00:47:06.826 --> 00:47:08.036
Goodnight.

1180
00:47:08.036 --> 00:47:09.412
Bye.

1181
00:47:09.412 --> 00:47:11.414
Goodnight.

1182
00:47:38.274 --> 00:47:40.694
Hi.

1183
00:47:40.694 --> 00:47:42.404
I know.
it's been two days.

1184
00:47:42.404 --> 00:47:44.489
I'm sorry.

1185
00:47:44.489 --> 00:47:46.199
And it has been three days.

1186
00:47:46.199 --> 00:47:48.451
Are you okay?
What's wrong?

1187
00:47:48.451 --> 00:47:50.912
Nothing's wrong.
I'm just really busy.

1188
00:47:50.912 --> 00:47:52.163
Not buying it.

1189
00:47:52.163 --> 00:47:54.082
I sent you
three pictures of Daniel.

1190
00:47:54.082 --> 00:47:55.458
I've sent you two articles

1191
00:47:55.458 --> 00:47:56.835
I thought
you would find interesting.

1192
00:47:56.835 --> 00:47:58.753
And a link
to a pair of shoes I love.

1193
00:47:58.753 --> 00:48:01.256
And a hilarious penguin video!

1194
00:48:01.256 --> 00:48:03.758
Well. all penguin videos
are hilarious.

1195
00:48:03.758 --> 00:48:05.927
<i>You always respond.
even when you're busy.</i>

1196
00:48:05.927 --> 00:48:09.055
<i>You always find time to send
at least a heart or something.</i>

1197
00:48:09.055 --> 00:48:10.432
Yeah. you're doing that thing

1198
00:48:10.432 --> 00:48:13.685
where you get vague
when you're feeling overwhelmed.

1199
00:48:13.685 --> 00:48:15.770
What? I don't get vague.

1200
00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:17.272
No. you do. actually.

1201
00:48:17.272 --> 00:48:19.107
Where's Paolo?
Is he back yet?

1202
00:48:19.107 --> 00:48:22.235
No. he is still in Italy

1203
00:48:22.235 --> 00:48:24.946
for at least
one or two more weeks.

1204
00:48:24.946 --> 00:48:26.489
<i>How are you
handling that?</i>

1205
00:48:26.489 --> 00:48:27.991
Uh...

1206
00:48:29.451 --> 00:48:31.077
Someone's at the door.

1207
00:48:31.077 --> 00:48:32.829
I'll call you later?

1208
00:48:32.829 --> 00:48:34.330
<i>Do you promise this time?</i>

1209
00:48:35.832 --> 00:48:37.083
Yeah. yeah. I will.
I promise.

1210
00:48:41.504 --> 00:48:42.964
Hi.

1211
00:48:42.964 --> 00:48:43.840
Emma di Stefano?

1212
00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:44.966
Yeah?

1213
00:48:44.966 --> 00:48:46.593
This is for you.

1214
00:48:46.593 --> 00:48:48.219
I didn't order a pizza.

1215
00:48:48.219 --> 00:48:50.638
Well. congratulations.
You just got a free pizza!

1216
00:48:50.638 --> 00:48:52.515
Thanks.

1217
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:22.629
What are you doing?

1218
00:49:22.629 --> 00:49:24.172
Oh. God.

1219
00:49:24.172 --> 00:49:26.174
Is this still
about that little spider?

1220
00:49:26.174 --> 00:49:28.009
It's not little.
"Substantial".

1221
00:49:28.009 --> 00:49:30.637
The word you used
was "substantial".

1222
00:49:30.637 --> 00:49:31.846
She's long gone.

1223
00:49:31.846 --> 00:49:33.223
Hey! Speaking of cool bugs--

1224
00:49:33.223 --> 00:49:34.516
That's not a thing.

1225
00:49:34.516 --> 00:49:36.643
Come on now.
Charlotte's cool. Be nice.

1226
00:49:36.643 --> 00:49:39.979
You will not believe what
I saw in the park this morning--

1227
00:49:39.979 --> 00:49:41.314
a giant swarm of ladybugs.

1228
00:49:41.314 --> 00:49:42.607
Oh.

1229
00:49:42.607 --> 00:49:43.858
Do you know what they call
a herd of ladybugs?

1230
00:49:43.858 --> 00:49:45.860
It's probably not a "herd".

1231
00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:47.112
- Oh.
- No.

1232
00:49:47.112 --> 00:49:48.697
They call it a "loveliness".

1233
00:49:48.697 --> 00:49:50.323
- Really?
- Can you believe that?

1234
00:49:50.323 --> 00:49:52.450
- A "loveliness"?
-"A loveliness of ladybugs."

1235
00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:53.827
- Oh.
- I know.

1236
00:49:53.827 --> 00:49:55.036
You know. sometimes.

1237
00:49:55.036 --> 00:49:56.538
the people who are in charge
of naming things

1238
00:49:56.538 --> 00:49:57.497
really get it right.

1239
00:49:57.497 --> 00:49:58.915
Hmm.

1240
00:49:58.915 --> 00:50:02.085
So. I did something last night

1241
00:50:02.085 --> 00:50:04.254
that I did not think
I was going to do.

1242
00:50:04.254 --> 00:50:05.964
I read all of the comments

1243
00:50:05.964 --> 00:50:07.799
on the two videos
you posted about me.

1244
00:50:07.799 --> 00:50:09.134
They're nice. aren't they?

1245
00:50:09.134 --> 00:50:11.553
Most of them
were quite lovely.

1246
00:50:14.681 --> 00:50:17.892
So...?

1247
00:50:17.892 --> 00:50:20.520
So. what video
are we doing next?

1248
00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:22.397
We are not.

1249
00:50:22.397 --> 00:50:24.357
Why not?

1250
00:50:24.357 --> 00:50:25.608
Emma. this could be
a whole thing.

1251
00:50:25.608 --> 00:50:27.235
Mini-stories.

1252
00:50:27.235 --> 00:50:27.986
You have so many views already.
and you weren't even trying.

1253
00:50:30.238 --> 00:50:32.449
Well. I've been asked
not to continue them.

1254
00:50:32.449 --> 00:50:33.408
By who? By Nancy?

1255
00:50:33.408 --> 00:50:34.909
Mm.

1256
00:50:34.909 --> 00:50:36.995
Since when does Nancy get
a vote in your personal life?

1257
00:50:36.995 --> 00:50:38.413
It doesn't really matter.

1258
00:50:38.413 --> 00:50:41.374
My brief stint as Everyone's
Favorite Art Historian

1259
00:50:41.374 --> 00:50:44.127
is officially over. and--

1260
00:50:45.045 --> 00:50:46.838
Is that--

1261
00:50:46.838 --> 00:50:48.006
what is in that?

1262
00:50:48.006 --> 00:50:48.923
Is that Charlotte
in that cup?

1263
00:50:48.923 --> 00:50:51.384
Yes.

1264
00:50:52.427 --> 00:50:53.762
- She was on my desk?
- Mm-hmm.

1265
00:50:54.929 --> 00:50:56.014
I thought you said
she was long gone.

1266
00:50:56.014 --> 00:50:57.766
I lied.

1267
00:50:57.766 --> 00:50:58.933
Do you wanna know
the exact moment

1268
00:50:58.933 --> 00:51:00.018
I decided
I wanted to T.A. for you?

1269
00:51:00.018 --> 00:51:01.978
No. I--

1270
00:51:01.978 --> 00:51:03.980
I'm gonna tell you.
It was freshman year.

1271
00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:05.023
You were talking about

1272
00:51:05.023 --> 00:51:06.775
the difference between
museum art

1273
00:51:06.775 --> 00:51:08.193
and the type of art
that you walk past every day.

1274
00:51:08.193 --> 00:51:09.402
and you don't even notice.

1275
00:51:09.402 --> 00:51:13.323
how art and history
are so interconnected.

1276
00:51:13.323 --> 00:51:15.909
You don't need to walk through
some museum to experience them.

1277
00:51:15.909 --> 00:51:17.827
That's when I realized
how accessible art could be.

1278
00:51:17.827 --> 00:51:19.788
if you just knew
where to look.

1279
00:51:19.788 --> 00:51:21.831
It was inspiring.

1280
00:51:21.831 --> 00:51:24.167
You were inspiring.

1281
00:51:25.335 --> 00:51:28.421
But I guess it's time
for your budget meeting.

1282
00:51:29.881 --> 00:51:32.008
Let's go. Charlotte.

1283
00:51:48.191 --> 00:51:51.027
And then there's
the Art History major?

1284
00:51:51.027 --> 00:51:52.195
And then there-- yep.

1285
00:51:53.947 --> 00:51:56.491
Yes. they're all very. very
jealous of my success.

1286
00:51:56.491 --> 00:51:58.118
but you know
how families are.

1287
00:51:58.118 --> 00:52:01.621
I'm the youngest.
and I'm the only girl. and...

1288
00:52:01.621 --> 00:52:03.498
the weird one.

1289
00:52:03.498 --> 00:52:05.917
Yeah. but we all--
we get along pretty well.

1290
00:52:07.002 --> 00:52:09.254
So. what's the verdict?

1291
00:52:09.254 --> 00:52:11.589
Oh. on the Cubano?

1292
00:52:11.589 --> 00:52:13.299
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

1293
00:52:13.299 --> 00:52:14.843
- No?
- No. I don't think--

1294
00:52:14.843 --> 00:52:16.136
I'm sorry.

1295
00:52:16.136 --> 00:52:19.055
I mean. it's nice
being this far from home.

1296
00:52:19.055 --> 00:52:21.057
it's like a little taste
of Miami. so...

1297
00:52:21.057 --> 00:52:23.184
- Oh.
- Yeah. what'd you think?

1298
00:52:23.184 --> 00:52:26.479
Um. well. this is
my first Cubano.

1299
00:52:26.479 --> 00:52:29.107
so it's the best one
I've ever had.

1300
00:52:29.107 --> 00:52:30.191
- Come on!
- Yeah.

1301
00:52:30.191 --> 00:52:31.484
Have you never been to Miami?

1302
00:52:31.484 --> 00:52:33.111
I have never been to Florida.

1303
00:52:33.111 --> 00:52:34.446
You serious?

1304
00:52:34.446 --> 00:52:36.781
Oh. wow. I gotta
take you sometime.

1305
00:52:36.781 --> 00:52:39.784
We'll go to Little Havana
and we'll have some real food.

1306
00:52:39.784 --> 00:52:41.077
and then I'll take you
to the beach. of course--

1307
00:52:41.077 --> 00:52:42.412
Ahem.

1308
00:52:42.412 --> 00:52:44.205
...And then. um. my friend
just got this boat--

1309
00:52:44.205 --> 00:52:45.749
Uh. talk to me
about you and Paolo.

1310
00:52:45.749 --> 00:52:47.083
How did you decide

1311
00:52:47.083 --> 00:52:48.376
to come up here
and start working for him?

1312
00:52:49.919 --> 00:52:52.213
Um...

1313
00:52:52.213 --> 00:52:53.923
not much to tell. really.

1314
00:52:53.923 --> 00:52:55.884
He just--
he needed help. so.

1315
00:53:20.116 --> 00:53:21.618
Okay.

1316
00:53:29.167 --> 00:53:30.627
Seriously?

1317
00:53:36.716 --> 00:53:37.676
Emma.

1318
00:53:37.676 --> 00:53:39.094
- Oh. good morning.
- Good morning.

1319
00:53:39.094 --> 00:53:40.595
I was wondering
if you would wait for me?

1320
00:53:40.595 --> 00:53:42.764
There's something
I'd like to discuss with you.

1321
00:53:42.764 --> 00:53:44.683
Of course.

1322
00:53:44.683 --> 00:53:46.976
Can I have
a black coffee. please?

1323
00:53:48.853 --> 00:53:51.606
So. it's basically
20 minutes at 350.

1324
00:53:51.606 --> 00:53:53.942
and then you glaze them
once they cool.

1325
00:53:53.942 --> 00:53:55.276
Well. that sounds delicious.

1326
00:53:55.276 --> 00:53:56.653
Mm!
Oh. the grandkids love them.

1327
00:53:56.653 --> 00:53:57.821
Mm-hmm.

1328
00:53:57.821 --> 00:53:59.823
Nancy...

1329
00:53:59.823 --> 00:54:02.951
I feel like
you might be avoiding something.

1330
00:54:02.951 --> 00:54:04.577
Well. I am.

1331
00:54:04.577 --> 00:54:06.162
Um...

1332
00:54:06.162 --> 00:54:08.373
it's a difficult issue
to address.

1333
00:54:08.373 --> 00:54:10.291
especially with
another woman.

1334
00:54:10.291 --> 00:54:12.711
Emma. I've always
enjoyed your style.

1335
00:54:14.129 --> 00:54:15.797
My style?

1336
00:54:15.797 --> 00:54:17.090
Yes. your taste in clothing--
the bright colors.

1337
00:54:17.090 --> 00:54:18.341
Oh.

1338
00:54:18.341 --> 00:54:20.135
You always look like

1339
00:54:20.135 --> 00:54:21.594
Andy Warhol
and Georgia O'Keeffe

1340
00:54:21.594 --> 00:54:23.471
are going
to a Holi festival together.

1341
00:54:23.471 --> 00:54:25.306
but you have to know.

1342
00:54:25.306 --> 00:54:26.474
it's just not
an appropriate look

1343
00:54:26.474 --> 00:54:28.184
for a Department Chair.

1344
00:54:28.184 --> 00:54:30.103
Now. before you argue with me.

1345
00:54:30.103 --> 00:54:31.896
I-- I don't care
about other departments.

1346
00:54:31.896 --> 00:54:34.649
I care about our department
and the image we present.

1347
00:54:34.649 --> 00:54:36.651
and if we're going to be
taken seriously--

1348
00:54:36.651 --> 00:54:39.946
Art History has
an uphill battle already.

1349
00:54:39.946 --> 00:54:42.490
Let's not make it harder
than it has to be.

1350
00:54:42.490 --> 00:54:43.408
Mm.

1351
00:54:43.408 --> 00:54:44.826
Mm. good talk!

1352
00:54:44.826 --> 00:54:45.994
Mm-hmm.

1353
00:54:47.871 --> 00:54:49.831
Enjoy your day.

1354
00:54:56.379 --> 00:54:58.381
Okay. yep.

1355
00:54:58.381 --> 00:55:00.508
I will send the contracts
over to him this morning.

1356
00:55:00.508 --> 00:55:02.093
<i>Bravo. Good.</i>

1357
00:55:02.093 --> 00:55:04.012
Listen. I need a favor.

1358
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:06.973
Really?

1359
00:55:06.973 --> 00:55:08.058
Okay.

1360
00:55:13.813 --> 00:55:15.398
I cannot believe

1361
00:55:15.398 --> 00:55:16.983
you have recruited me
to your life of crime.

1362
00:55:16.983 --> 00:55:18.193
This is breaking and entering.

1363
00:55:18.193 --> 00:55:19.861
There's no "breaking".

1364
00:55:19.861 --> 00:55:21.905
Paolo told me where the key was
and what the code is.

1365
00:55:21.905 --> 00:55:22.989
It's just "entering".

1366
00:55:22.989 --> 00:55:25.116
Who even keeps
a key under a flowerpot?

1367
00:55:25.116 --> 00:55:26.201
Paolo?

1368
00:55:26.201 --> 00:55:28.745
Come on.

1369
00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:32.290
How much time do we have?

1370
00:55:32.290 --> 00:55:35.043
Um. 20 minutes
until her class ends.

1371
00:55:35.043 --> 00:55:36.461
five minutes in her office.

1372
00:55:36.461 --> 00:55:38.004
10 minutes for her to walk home.
if nobody catches her.

1373
00:55:38.004 --> 00:55:39.255
So. our window is 35 minutes.

1374
00:55:39.255 --> 00:55:41.257
Okay.

1375
00:55:41.257 --> 00:55:43.677
You start in here.
and I'll set up out back.

1376
00:56:09.911 --> 00:56:12.080
Okay. backyard is done.

1377
00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:14.666
This looks amazing.

1378
00:56:14.666 --> 00:56:16.584
- Let's get out of here.
- Yeah. okay.

1379
00:56:23.633 --> 00:56:24.843
- Wait-wait-wait!
- What?

1380
00:56:24.843 --> 00:56:26.011
Music.

1381
00:56:26.011 --> 00:56:28.054
Go. go. go!

1382
00:56:35.979 --> 00:56:37.856
All clear.

1383
00:56:42.444 --> 00:56:43.987
Go. go. go.

1384
00:56:49.659 --> 00:56:51.202
Just walk normal!
Be yourself!

1385
00:56:51.202 --> 00:56:52.328
I don't know what means.

1386
00:56:52.328 --> 00:56:53.413
Those are two different things!

1387
00:56:55.832 --> 00:56:57.834
Whoa!

1388
00:57:03.631 --> 00:57:05.216
- Oh!
- Shh. shh. shh!

1389
00:57:07.177 --> 00:57:08.678
- Okay.
- Okay.

1390
00:57:08.678 --> 00:57:10.555
Okay.

1391
00:57:19.356 --> 00:57:21.524
Hello?

1392
00:57:34.954 --> 00:57:36.081
All right.

1393
00:57:36.081 --> 00:57:38.833
So. what's next on
our. uh. crime spree?

1394
00:57:38.833 --> 00:57:40.001
Oh. there's a wing place nearby.

1395
00:57:40.001 --> 00:57:41.711
You're talking about
Lord of the Wings?

1396
00:57:41.711 --> 00:57:42.754
- Yes!
- Where you have to sign

1397
00:57:42.754 --> 00:57:44.464
the waiver
if you order them spicy?

1398
00:57:44.464 --> 00:57:45.840
Yes. That's the one. yeah.

1399
00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:48.134
You wanna go do some damage.
mainly to ourselves?

1400
00:57:50.387 --> 00:57:52.097
Um...

1401
00:57:52.097 --> 00:57:53.223
you know what?

1402
00:57:53.223 --> 00:57:56.643
I-- Sorry.
I have to go.

1403
00:57:56.643 --> 00:57:59.229
Um. but have fun.

1404
00:57:59.229 --> 00:58:01.356
and remember that...

1405
00:58:01.356 --> 00:58:04.234
cold milk
helps with the heat. Heh!

1406
00:58:04.234 --> 00:58:05.819
Are-- Are you sure?

1407
00:58:54.701 --> 00:58:56.953
<i>Scusi. signorina?</i>

1408
00:58:56.953 --> 00:58:59.497
<i>Paolo!</i>

1409
00:58:59.497 --> 00:59:01.249
Is this seat taken?

1410
00:59:01.249 --> 00:59:04.419
Oh. this seat? Um...

1411
00:59:04.419 --> 00:59:07.797
well. I don't see
any other tables around.

1412
00:59:07.797 --> 00:59:10.383
so. yes. you could sit here.

1413
00:59:11.634 --> 00:59:13.470
Although...

1414
00:59:13.470 --> 00:59:16.306
you look familiar to me.

1415
00:59:16.306 --> 00:59:17.599
Were you following me?

1416
00:59:17.599 --> 00:59:19.934
No. but I get that a lot.

1417
00:59:19.934 --> 00:59:21.853
I see.

1418
00:59:21.853 --> 00:59:23.563
<i>You were fortunate
to get this table.</i>

1419
00:59:23.563 --> 00:59:24.731
<i>right by the water.</i>

1420
00:59:24.731 --> 00:59:26.649
<i>That's not easy in Venice.</i>

1421
00:59:28.276 --> 00:59:30.278
Yes. it's very beautiful.

1422
00:59:33.323 --> 00:59:34.574
<i>May I...</i>

1423
00:59:34.574 --> 00:59:36.117
pour for you?

1424
00:59:36.117 --> 00:59:37.744
No. thank you.

1425
00:59:37.744 --> 00:59:39.329
I think I could do it.

1426
00:59:43.667 --> 00:59:45.293
And to what are we toasting?

1427
00:59:45.293 --> 00:59:46.544
<i>All'amore.</i>

1428
00:59:46.544 --> 00:59:48.296
<i>To love!</i>

1429
00:59:48.296 --> 00:59:51.049
<i>To love.</i>

1430
00:59:53.802 --> 00:59:55.053
<i>And tell me.</i>

1431
00:59:55.053 --> 00:59:56.388
sir.

1432
00:59:56.388 --> 00:59:57.472
are you in love?

1433
00:59:57.472 --> 01:00:00.850
Sì. Very much so.

1434
01:00:00.850 --> 01:00:04.437
Well. she is
a very lucky lady.

1435
01:00:04.437 --> 01:00:05.855
No. I am lucky...

1436
01:00:05.855 --> 01:00:08.233
<i>and she has exquisite taste.</i>

1437
01:00:08.233 --> 01:00:10.985
<i>except for
one questionable position</i>

1438
01:00:10.985 --> 01:00:12.946
<i>on pizza.</i>

1439
01:00:22.455 --> 01:00:23.873
- Hi. there.
- Hey.

1440
01:00:23.873 --> 01:00:25.250
So...

1441
01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:28.086
I had a lovely date
with my husband last night.

1442
01:00:29.546 --> 01:00:32.841
He informed me
he had a local operative.

1443
01:00:32.841 --> 01:00:35.719
so just wanted to come by
and say thank you.

1444
01:00:35.719 --> 01:00:37.345
Well. I don't know
what you're talking about.

1445
01:00:37.345 --> 01:00:39.180
but you're welcome.

1446
01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:42.017
I know you miss him.
but he's gonna be home soon.

1447
01:00:42.017 --> 01:00:44.019
Hey. Emma?

1448
01:00:44.019 --> 01:00:47.397
Can I ask you
a question...

1449
01:00:49.149 --> 01:00:50.817
...about Lily?

1450
01:00:51.943 --> 01:00:53.236
Sure.

1451
01:00:53.236 --> 01:00:54.696
Okay.

1452
01:00:54.696 --> 01:00:58.408
So... I like her.

1453
01:00:58.408 --> 01:01:01.286
And we've been out a few times.

1454
01:01:01.286 --> 01:01:03.163
done a little light
breaking-and-entering--

1455
01:01:03.163 --> 01:01:04.289
Oh. did you?

1456
01:01:04.289 --> 01:01:06.166
Mm. just a little bit.

1457
01:01:06.166 --> 01:01:08.668
but like. we're out.
we're having fun.

1458
01:01:08.668 --> 01:01:10.337
we're talking.
we're connecting.

1459
01:01:10.337 --> 01:01:13.548
and then all of a sudden.
she throws up these walls.

1460
01:01:13.548 --> 01:01:14.966
Yeah.

1461
01:01:14.966 --> 01:01:17.927
And I know she mentioned
"Charlotte" the other day.

1462
01:01:17.927 --> 01:01:20.180
Is Charlotte. uh.
a girlfriend?

1463
01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:22.807
Or an ex-girlfriend.
or somebody that--

1464
01:01:22.807 --> 01:01:25.560
No. Charlotte's
her code word for spiders.

1465
01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:27.228
For spiders?

1466
01:01:27.228 --> 01:01:28.313
Mm-hmm.

1467
01:01:28.313 --> 01:01:29.731
I really adore Lily.

1468
01:01:29.731 --> 01:01:31.858
and nothing
would make me happier

1469
01:01:31.858 --> 01:01:33.193
than to see the two of you together.

1470
01:01:33.193 --> 01:01:36.029
but I really think
you just need to talk to her.

1471
01:01:37.739 --> 01:01:39.074
I-I will tell you. though.

1472
01:01:39.074 --> 01:01:41.576
that she often goes
to Grove Rock Park

1473
01:01:41.576 --> 01:01:44.579
in the mornings.

1474
01:01:44.579 --> 01:01:46.456
- Okay. thank you.
- For what it's worth.

1475
01:01:48.917 --> 01:01:51.336
Hey. quick question.

1476
01:01:51.336 --> 01:01:53.755
Are people still coming by
just to see the veil?

1477
01:01:53.755 --> 01:01:55.590
Oh. yeah. They love it.

1478
01:01:55.590 --> 01:01:58.009
Everybody wants to buy it.
or rent it.

1479
01:02:08.103 --> 01:02:09.396
Hi.

1480
01:02:09.396 --> 01:02:11.606
<i>Ciao. amore.</i>

1481
01:02:11.606 --> 01:02:13.191
Did you have dinner?

1482
01:02:13.191 --> 01:02:14.275
Not yet.

1483
01:02:14.275 --> 01:02:15.735
Um...

1484
01:02:15.735 --> 01:02:17.278
I wanna ask you something.

1485
01:02:17.278 --> 01:02:19.072
and I want you
to tell me the truth.

1486
01:02:19.072 --> 01:02:20.407
Of course.

1487
01:02:20.407 --> 01:02:21.366
<i>How is the store doing?</i>

1488
01:02:21.366 --> 01:02:23.993
It's early.

1489
01:02:23.993 --> 01:02:26.955
but breaking into
the U.S. market has been hard.

1490
01:02:26.955 --> 01:02:29.582
<i>but honestly.
our numbers look good.</i>

1491
01:02:29.582 --> 01:02:31.334
<i>'cause of
the small walk-in sales.</i>

1492
01:02:31.334 --> 01:02:34.170
Okay. so I wanna
run something past you.

1493
01:02:34.170 --> 01:02:36.464
It's a really bad idea.
and I need you to tell me that.

1494
01:02:36.464 --> 01:02:38.383
It's a really bad idea.

1495
01:02:38.383 --> 01:02:41.094
No! You have to listen first.
then you can tell me.

1496
01:02:41.094 --> 01:02:42.554
Okay.

1497
01:02:42.554 --> 01:02:46.016
So. I have been looking
at all the pictures Lily took

1498
01:02:46.016 --> 01:02:48.727
of people checking out the veil
on opening night.

1499
01:02:48.727 --> 01:02:52.313
People like this
come into the store every day.

1500
01:02:52.313 --> 01:02:53.648
<i>Sì.</i>

1501
01:02:53.648 --> 01:02:55.108
We know the House of Stefano

1502
01:02:55.108 --> 01:02:57.152
created Arianna's veil originally.

1503
01:02:57.152 --> 01:02:59.738
So. you guys own
all the rights to the design.

1504
01:02:59.738 --> 01:03:01.781
What if...

1505
01:03:01.781 --> 01:03:04.659
you began creating replicas
of Arianna's veil?

1506
01:03:04.659 --> 01:03:06.953
Hmm.

1507
01:03:06.953 --> 01:03:08.872
<i>It's a classically
beautiful design.</i>

1508
01:03:08.872 --> 01:03:10.832
That's why
Avery initially noticed it.

1509
01:03:10.832 --> 01:03:13.001
So. I think people will want it.

1510
01:03:13.001 --> 01:03:14.753
even if they don't
know the history.

1511
01:03:14.753 --> 01:03:17.464
Okay. continue.

1512
01:03:17.464 --> 01:03:20.425
And for those that do think
the veil is special.

1513
01:03:20.425 --> 01:03:22.427
even though they'll know
they're buying a replica

1514
01:03:22.427 --> 01:03:24.721
and it doesn't have
the same legend attached.

1515
01:03:24.721 --> 01:03:26.389
I think maybe
they'll still want it. too.

1516
01:03:26.389 --> 01:03:29.225
even if they're not planning on
getting married any time soon.

1517
01:03:29.225 --> 01:03:31.644
Who would buy a veil
if they're not getting married?

1518
01:03:31.644 --> 01:03:32.937
Well...

1519
01:03:34.356 --> 01:03:36.441
Of course. Never mind.

1520
01:03:36.441 --> 01:03:38.860
<i>And I thought we could
even customize it</i>

1521
01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:40.862
<i>with their initial.
just like the original.</i>

1522
01:03:40.862 --> 01:03:44.282
and you could call it
"The Arianna".

1523
01:03:45.742 --> 01:03:47.619
The Arianna...

1524
01:03:48.912 --> 01:03:51.289
I think it's brilliant.

1525
01:03:51.289 --> 01:03:54.209
<i>Let me ask Sophia about it
from a marketing perspective.</i>

1526
01:03:54.209 --> 01:03:55.752
What-what was that word
you just said?

1527
01:03:55.752 --> 01:03:57.796
Br--
It started with a "B"?

1528
01:03:57.796 --> 01:03:59.547
Which one?

1529
01:03:59.547 --> 01:04:01.841
"Brilliant." was it?

1530
01:04:01.841 --> 01:04:03.426
I think that was--
I think that was it.

1531
01:04:03.426 --> 01:04:05.178
<i>I don't remember.</i>

1532
01:04:05.178 --> 01:04:06.596
No. no. no.
I think you do remember.

1533
01:04:08.098 --> 01:04:10.392
Hey! I went over the essays
for your seminar class.

1534
01:04:10.392 --> 01:04:11.559
and I wasn't sure
about a few of them.

1535
01:04:11.559 --> 01:04:12.727
so when you get a minute.

1536
01:04:12.727 --> 01:04:14.145
can you make sure
you agree with my notes?

1537
01:04:14.145 --> 01:04:15.438
- Of course.
- Thank you.

1538
01:04:17.774 --> 01:04:19.442
Are you okay?

1539
01:04:19.442 --> 01:04:21.236
Did someone die?

1540
01:04:21.236 --> 01:04:23.738
No. Why?

1541
01:04:23.738 --> 01:04:25.156
Because you look sad

1542
01:04:25.156 --> 01:04:28.076
and you're dressed
for a funeral.

1543
01:04:28.076 --> 01:04:31.788
No. I am dressed
for the job I want.

1544
01:04:31.788 --> 01:04:33.373
You want to be
a defense attorney?

1545
01:04:33.373 --> 01:04:34.749
Ah... very funny.

1546
01:04:35.917 --> 01:04:38.086
Can I talk to you
about the videos?

1547
01:04:38.086 --> 01:04:40.463
I have to take them down?
It's okay. I understand.

1548
01:04:40.463 --> 01:04:42.215
I am surprised
that you got away with it

1549
01:04:42.215 --> 01:04:43.425
for as long as you did.

1550
01:04:43.425 --> 01:04:45.552
No. no. no. no. Leave them up.
It's okay.

1551
01:04:45.552 --> 01:04:47.303
Okay.

1552
01:04:48.221 --> 01:04:50.056
I wanted to ask you...

1553
01:04:52.434 --> 01:04:55.103
...do you really believe
these videos are a way

1554
01:04:55.103 --> 01:04:57.272
to get people interested
in everyday art?

1555
01:04:57.272 --> 01:04:58.440
I do.

1556
01:04:58.440 --> 01:04:59.858
and I was thinking.

1557
01:04:59.858 --> 01:05:01.276
do you remember that one class
where you talked about

1558
01:05:01.276 --> 01:05:03.862
the World's Fair in Chicago
in... whenever it is?

1559
01:05:03.862 --> 01:05:05.405
- 1893.
- 1893!

1560
01:05:05.405 --> 01:05:07.282
And they built the White City
for the exhibits.

1561
01:05:07.282 --> 01:05:09.284
but they didn't design
the buildings to last?

1562
01:05:09.284 --> 01:05:10.618
Right. but if you know
where to look.

1563
01:05:10.618 --> 01:05:12.203
there're still pieces of it
all around Chicago.

1564
01:05:12.203 --> 01:05:14.497
Exactly!
That is everyday art.

1565
01:05:14.497 --> 01:05:16.249
We could make more videos.

1566
01:05:16.249 --> 01:05:17.250
We could
make more videos...

1567
01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:20.128
but you cannot be dressed like

1568
01:05:20.128 --> 01:05:22.297
"Everyone's Favorite
Funeral Director".

1569
01:05:22.297 --> 01:05:23.882
Okay.

1570
01:05:23.882 --> 01:05:25.633
I really like this idea--

1571
01:05:25.633 --> 01:05:27.093
Mm-hmm.

1572
01:05:27.093 --> 01:05:28.803
...But I know Nancy doesn't.

1573
01:05:28.803 --> 01:05:30.472
So. my question to you is--

1574
01:05:30.472 --> 01:05:32.349
if I decide
to make more videos--

1575
01:05:32.349 --> 01:05:33.183
Mm-hmm?

1576
01:05:33.183 --> 01:05:34.517
- ...Are you in?
- I'm in.

1577
01:05:35.643 --> 01:05:36.644
You can think about it.

1578
01:05:36.644 --> 01:05:37.812
I'm in!

1579
01:05:37.812 --> 01:05:39.647
Don't have to decide
right away.

1580
01:05:39.647 --> 01:05:41.608
I'm in! I am in!

1581
01:05:41.608 --> 01:05:43.026
Just let it marinate.

1582
01:05:43.026 --> 01:05:45.278
I took three seconds.
and it turns out I'm in.

1583
01:05:55.372 --> 01:05:56.831
Hi.

1584
01:05:56.831 --> 01:05:58.583
I was just
about to head home.

1585
01:05:58.583 --> 01:05:59.709
<i>I won't keep you.</i>

1586
01:05:59.709 --> 01:06:02.337
I just talked to Sophia
about your idea.

1587
01:06:02.337 --> 01:06:04.214
<i>We'll do a trial run
and see.</i>

1588
01:06:04.214 --> 01:06:06.049
So...

1589
01:06:06.049 --> 01:06:07.425
<i>what are your plans
for tonight?</i>

1590
01:06:07.425 --> 01:06:10.178
Well. I was gonna do
one of my online-chat dinners

1591
01:06:10.178 --> 01:06:11.680
with Tracy and Avery.

1592
01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:14.849
I haven't really talked to them
for over a week.

1593
01:06:14.849 --> 01:06:16.768
Eh! <i>Mamma mia--</i>
a whole week?

1594
01:06:16.768 --> 01:06:19.979
That's a long time for us.

1595
01:06:19.979 --> 01:06:23.024
And speaking of long times...

1596
01:06:23.024 --> 01:06:25.193
when are you coming home?

1597
01:06:26.152 --> 01:06:27.570
Not much longer.

1598
01:06:29.030 --> 01:06:31.282
That's--

1599
01:06:32.909 --> 01:06:34.661
I gotta go.

1600
01:06:37.038 --> 01:06:38.707
Emma?

1601
01:06:38.707 --> 01:06:41.084
<i>Pronto.</i>

1602
01:06:56.891 --> 01:06:58.685
Finally! We're starved.

1603
01:06:58.685 --> 01:07:00.645
You forget our tummies
are on East Coast time.

1604
01:07:00.645 --> 01:07:03.314
What are you doing here?

1605
01:07:03.314 --> 01:07:05.066
Well. you did start to do
that vague thing again...

1606
01:07:05.066 --> 01:07:06.526
So. we flew in for the night.

1607
01:07:06.526 --> 01:07:07.861
We felt like
maybe you needed us.

1608
01:07:07.861 --> 01:07:09.237
Oh!

1609
01:07:10.947 --> 01:07:12.741
I really do.

1610
01:07:19.539 --> 01:07:20.707
Did someone die?

1611
01:07:22.792 --> 01:07:24.127
Um. I don't think so.

1612
01:07:28.256 --> 01:07:31.217
And then.
I kinda hung up on him.

1613
01:07:31.217 --> 01:07:32.677
It was not my finest moment.

1614
01:07:33.845 --> 01:07:36.264
All right. well.
let me help you with that.

1615
01:07:36.264 --> 01:07:38.141
I can only imagine
how hard this is.

1616
01:07:38.141 --> 01:07:40.560
but you guys
are so. so good together.

1617
01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:42.479
I mean. there has to be
a way forward.

1618
01:07:42.479 --> 01:07:43.938
I know.

1619
01:07:43.938 --> 01:07:45.774
This is gonna sound crazy.

1620
01:07:45.774 --> 01:07:48.360
because I'm the woman
who will never leave New York.

1621
01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:51.946
and probably. also.
it's pretty hypocritical of me.

1622
01:07:51.946 --> 01:07:54.699
but. um.
why stay in Chicago?

1623
01:07:54.699 --> 01:07:57.452
I mean. your family--
your parents moved to Florida.

1624
01:07:57.452 --> 01:08:00.914
You love Italy.
you love Paolo's whole family.

1625
01:08:00.914 --> 01:08:02.207
If you were there.

1626
01:08:02.207 --> 01:08:04.376
you would have a million
babysitters all lined up.

1627
01:08:04.376 --> 01:08:05.627
Oh. I can

1628
01:08:05.627 --> 01:08:07.253
co-sign to the importance
of that last point.

1629
01:08:07.253 --> 01:08:08.588
Wildly important.

1630
01:08:09.631 --> 01:08:12.384
So. what's keeping you
in Chicago?

1631
01:08:12.384 --> 01:08:14.469
My job.

1632
01:08:14.469 --> 01:08:18.348
I've worked so hard
to get where I'm at and...

1633
01:08:19.683 --> 01:08:23.687
...it just feels like Paolo's
choosing his job over me.

1634
01:08:25.897 --> 01:08:28.274
Oh.

1635
01:08:28.274 --> 01:08:29.943
That's kind of
what I'm doing. huh?

1636
01:08:31.319 --> 01:08:33.863
I'm choosing my job
over Paolo.

1637
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:38.451
A little.

1638
01:08:38.451 --> 01:08:40.829
Can I ask you a question?

1639
01:08:40.829 --> 01:08:42.497
After you got married.

1640
01:08:42.497 --> 01:08:46.042
did you change anything
on your five-year plan?

1641
01:08:47.669 --> 01:08:49.587
No. not really.

1642
01:08:49.587 --> 01:08:52.090
Okay. so that's
kind of the point.

1643
01:08:52.090 --> 01:08:54.342
He has his goals.
and you have yours.

1644
01:08:54.342 --> 01:08:56.928
but what is it
that you guys want as a couple?

1645
01:08:59.097 --> 01:09:01.016
You know we love you.

1646
01:09:01.016 --> 01:09:03.935
and we are in awe
of your determination.

1647
01:09:03.935 --> 01:09:05.854
It's very impressive.

1648
01:09:05.854 --> 01:09:10.358
but you are making decisions
for two people now. you know?

1649
01:09:10.358 --> 01:09:12.694
And it's okay
to not want something

1650
01:09:12.694 --> 01:09:15.196
because you have something.
or someone.

1651
01:09:15.196 --> 01:09:17.240
that you want more.

1652
01:09:20.076 --> 01:09:22.370
I really hate meetings.

1653
01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:25.040
Oh! We know. We know.

1654
01:09:26.583 --> 01:09:28.335
And then Nancy gave-- when
she gave away my intro class.

1655
01:09:28.335 --> 01:09:29.878
I wanted to cry.

1656
01:09:29.878 --> 01:09:31.629
And my videos--

1657
01:09:31.629 --> 01:09:32.464
They're so good!

1658
01:09:32.464 --> 01:09:34.007
Right? That's what I think.

1659
01:09:34.007 --> 01:09:36.426
That is the most Emma thing
I've ever seen you do. truly.

1660
01:09:36.426 --> 01:09:37.385
Ever.

1661
01:09:37.385 --> 01:09:40.221
I just can't-- I can't--

1662
01:09:40.221 --> 01:09:41.348
how am I supposed
to just tell Nancy.

1663
01:09:41.348 --> 01:09:43.224
"Oh. just kidding."

1664
01:09:43.224 --> 01:09:45.894
after everything she did
to prepare me for this job.

1665
01:09:45.894 --> 01:09:48.104
Emma? You can.

1666
01:09:48.104 --> 01:09:50.857
You can tell her "no".

1667
01:09:57.947 --> 01:09:59.407
I'm back!

1668
01:09:59.407 --> 01:10:01.868
Ah! I'm so sorry about
the take-out coffee.

1669
01:10:01.868 --> 01:10:04.120
My machine is possessed.

1670
01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.790
Nonna's lace
is so beautiful.

1671
01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:08.667
- Ohh. Isn't it?
- Yes.

1672
01:10:08.667 --> 01:10:10.210
I just keep forgetting
to wear it.

1673
01:10:10.210 --> 01:10:11.461
- Thank you.
- Look at this.

1674
01:10:11.461 --> 01:10:13.213
There's a little embroidered
"E" for "Emma".

1675
01:10:13.213 --> 01:10:15.465
What? I never saw that!

1676
01:10:15.465 --> 01:10:16.591
She's the sweetest.

1677
01:10:16.591 --> 01:10:18.009
- She really is.
- Thank you.

1678
01:10:18.009 --> 01:10:19.260
- You're welcome.
- So pretty.

1679
01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:21.388
Oh. no. you guys.
The car is here.

1680
01:10:21.388 --> 01:10:22.931
Oh. no! Already?

1681
01:10:22.931 --> 01:10:24.391
Yes.

1682
01:10:24.391 --> 01:10:25.892
I thought it was. like.
15 minutes out.

1683
01:10:25.892 --> 01:10:27.268
but it's here.

1684
01:10:27.268 --> 01:10:28.520
I can't believe
you only came out for one night.

1685
01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:29.437
- I love you.
- Always.

1686
01:10:29.437 --> 01:10:30.814
You needed us. so we came.

1687
01:10:30.814 --> 01:10:32.148
Yeah. it's what we do.

1688
01:10:32.148 --> 01:10:33.483
- I love you.
- I love you.

1689
01:10:33.483 --> 01:10:34.484
Okay. well. we have to go.

1690
01:10:34.484 --> 01:10:35.610
- My rating--
- Okay.

1691
01:10:35.610 --> 01:10:36.695
Can we take some of those
for the road?

1692
01:10:36.695 --> 01:10:37.779
Oh. take them all.

1693
01:10:37.779 --> 01:10:39.114
- Avery.
- Love you.

1694
01:10:39.114 --> 01:10:41.157
Okay. no spilling
in the car. though. Okay?

1695
01:10:49.874 --> 01:10:50.959
Hi.

1696
01:10:50.959 --> 01:10:51.918
Oh!

1697
01:10:51.918 --> 01:10:52.877
Um...

1698
01:10:52.877 --> 01:10:54.921
uh... whoa.

1699
01:10:54.921 --> 01:10:55.964
Ha-ha! Hi.

1700
01:10:55.964 --> 01:10:57.382
I. um...

1701
01:10:57.382 --> 01:11:00.593
meant to do...
all of that.

1702
01:11:00.593 --> 01:11:02.971
I wish I had. like.
a judge's card to hold up.

1703
01:11:02.971 --> 01:11:04.014
I'd give ya a 9.8.

1704
01:11:04.014 --> 01:11:05.682
Not a perfect 10?

1705
01:11:05.682 --> 01:11:08.977
No! You'd need to break
your camera or a key limb

1706
01:11:08.977 --> 01:11:10.562
for a perfect 10.

1707
01:11:10.562 --> 01:11:12.564
Um. so...

1708
01:11:12.564 --> 01:11:13.690
listen.

1709
01:11:13.690 --> 01:11:14.691
Yeah. okay.

1710
01:11:16.109 --> 01:11:19.529
I dated a woman in Miami.
but it didn't work out.

1711
01:11:19.529 --> 01:11:21.156
Actually. I guess
that's not fair.

1712
01:11:21.156 --> 01:11:22.323
It ended well for her.

1713
01:11:22.323 --> 01:11:24.159
because she's engaged
to him now.

1714
01:11:24.159 --> 01:11:26.119
Oh! Ouch. I'm sorry.

1715
01:11:28.580 --> 01:11:33.460
And I made a vow. on the spot.
to never get serious again.

1716
01:11:34.878 --> 01:11:37.005
And for a year. I didn't.
but now...

1717
01:11:37.005 --> 01:11:39.174
I'm sitting in this park.

1718
01:11:39.174 --> 01:11:43.178
and I'm thinking about
breaking my vow...

1719
01:11:43.178 --> 01:11:45.263
but I just have one problem.

1720
01:11:45.263 --> 01:11:47.724
Just one?

1721
01:11:47.724 --> 01:11:50.226
Just one.

1722
01:11:50.226 --> 01:11:52.354
See. there's this woman.

1723
01:11:52.354 --> 01:11:55.774
and she's different
in all the right ways.

1724
01:11:57.275 --> 01:11:59.402
She checks all the boxes.

1725
01:12:03.531 --> 01:12:06.785
But she runs
kinda hot and cold.

1726
01:12:08.203 --> 01:12:09.662
We're having fun.
we're getting close.

1727
01:12:09.662 --> 01:12:11.373
and then she's running
the 100-yard dash

1728
01:12:11.373 --> 01:12:14.209
to get away from me.

1729
01:12:14.209 --> 01:12:16.169
Yeah. that's
a protection thing.

1730
01:12:16.169 --> 01:12:17.879
She has--

1731
01:12:21.549 --> 01:12:26.554
I... have dated men in the past

1732
01:12:26.554 --> 01:12:30.892
and it's always ended up
with some sort of disconnect...

1733
01:12:32.852 --> 01:12:37.232
...I guess. between who I am...

1734
01:12:37.232 --> 01:12:40.110
and who they want me to be.

1735
01:12:43.363 --> 01:12:47.450
Well. maybe you just
dated the wrong men?

1736
01:12:49.077 --> 01:12:51.955
They seem like the right men
at first. you know?

1737
01:12:53.498 --> 01:12:56.960
And they-- they don't come
with a warning label.

1738
01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:00.046
so. by the time
you figure it out...

1739
01:13:00.046 --> 01:13:01.256
um...

1740
01:13:01.256 --> 01:13:03.258
I know.
I know what you mean.

1741
01:13:03.258 --> 01:13:05.301
It's like. um...

1742
01:13:05.301 --> 01:13:07.387
if you just try harder.

1743
01:13:07.387 --> 01:13:09.055
then you can
love enough for both of you.

1744
01:13:10.765 --> 01:13:13.643
Yeah. that's exactly
how it feels.

1745
01:13:17.105 --> 01:13:18.732
So...

1746
01:13:21.192 --> 01:13:22.193
...here's the deal.

1747
01:13:22.193 --> 01:13:23.987
Ooh...

1748
01:13:25.613 --> 01:13:27.824
We can give up.

1749
01:13:29.117 --> 01:13:30.618
Or...

1750
01:13:30.618 --> 01:13:33.121
we can take a chance.

1751
01:13:33.121 --> 01:13:35.331
Just for today.

1752
01:13:35.331 --> 01:13:38.168
We can worry
about tomorrow later.

1753
01:13:39.711 --> 01:13:41.129
So...

1754
01:13:41.129 --> 01:13:42.505
I just want to be
clear on this.

1755
01:13:42.505 --> 01:13:44.132
We're dating
just for today?

1756
01:13:44.132 --> 01:13:45.925
Yeah.

1757
01:13:45.925 --> 01:13:47.761
Just for today.

1758
01:13:50.263 --> 01:13:51.890
Okay. I'm in.

1759
01:13:51.890 --> 01:13:54.184
Okay.

1760
01:13:54.184 --> 01:13:56.144
I will date you
just for today.

1761
01:13:56.144 --> 01:13:57.854
- Great.
- Mm-hmm.

1762
01:13:59.689 --> 01:14:01.483
Did their visit help?

1763
01:14:01.483 --> 01:14:04.444
Well. it gave me some clarity. but...

1764
01:14:05.653 --> 01:14:08.365
Look. in the end.
I'm not sure it matters.

1765
01:14:08.365 --> 01:14:09.991
I've committed to this.

1766
01:14:09.991 --> 01:14:12.994
and Nancy has spent
a lot of time mentoring me.

1767
01:14:12.994 --> 01:14:15.163
and now she's finally
ready to retire.

1768
01:14:15.163 --> 01:14:16.998
I can't just back out now.

1769
01:14:16.998 --> 01:14:18.583
<i>Emma.</i>

1770
01:14:18.583 --> 01:14:22.003
The best we can arrange
is three weeks here in Italy.

1771
01:14:22.003 --> 01:14:23.296
<i>and one in Chicago.</i>

1772
01:14:23.296 --> 01:14:24.464
I know. it's not ideal.

1773
01:14:24.464 --> 01:14:26.383
but for now.
it's a solution.

1774
01:14:26.383 --> 01:14:28.259
No. that's not a solution.

1775
01:14:29.761 --> 01:14:32.347
Look. I know how this goes.

1776
01:14:32.347 --> 01:14:33.431
<i>That works for two months.</i>

1777
01:14:33.431 --> 01:14:35.392
<i>and then</i>

1778
01:14:35.392 --> 01:14:37.560
you're postponing
just by a week or two.

1779
01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:38.687
and then a couple months later.

1780
01:14:38.687 --> 01:14:40.438
you miss it entirely.

1781
01:14:40.438 --> 01:14:44.359
and then you're not picking up
when I call you.

1782
01:14:44.359 --> 01:14:45.443
and then...

1783
01:14:45.443 --> 01:14:47.904
<i>Amore.</i>

1784
01:14:51.074 --> 01:14:54.202
I told you.
when we were in Italy.

1785
01:14:54.202 --> 01:14:56.287
I can't do long distance.

1786
01:14:56.287 --> 01:14:58.248
I don't want to do that again.

1787
01:14:59.624 --> 01:15:02.544
This isn't just
a business decision for me.

1788
01:15:02.544 --> 01:15:04.004
Papa's illness showed me

1789
01:15:04.004 --> 01:15:05.797
that I live too far
from my family.

1790
01:15:07.799 --> 01:15:10.093
I thought
I was your family now.

1791
01:15:14.681 --> 01:15:16.850
Let's talk about this later.

1792
01:15:25.233 --> 01:15:27.318
We've got a problem.

1793
01:15:27.318 --> 01:15:29.696
Oh. Uh...

1794
01:15:29.696 --> 01:15:31.656
yeah. what's wrong?

1795
01:15:31.656 --> 01:15:35.493
I just got the final budget
for next semester.

1796
01:15:35.493 --> 01:15:36.911
and there's
no getting around it.

1797
01:15:36.911 --> 01:15:38.371
You're gonna have
to let someone go.

1798
01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:43.335
Even if you retire?

1799
01:15:43.335 --> 01:15:44.919
Even <i>when</i> I retire. yes.

1800
01:15:44.919 --> 01:15:46.588
We're still one person over.

1801
01:15:46.588 --> 01:15:49.257
Now. I recommend
that you let Carissa go.

1802
01:15:49.257 --> 01:15:50.967
She's our least-experienced
professor.

1803
01:15:50.967 --> 01:15:54.012
and she cancels
more classes than anybody.

1804
01:15:54.012 --> 01:15:57.057
But that's because
she has two-year-old twins.

1805
01:15:57.057 --> 01:15:58.558
Mm-hmm.

1806
01:15:58.558 --> 01:16:00.602
Well. it's your decision.

1807
01:16:00.602 --> 01:16:02.354
I'll need it by tomorrow.

1808
01:16:05.607 --> 01:16:06.983
Nancy?

1809
01:16:09.861 --> 01:16:13.365
I... made my decision.

1810
01:16:13.365 --> 01:16:15.825
Oh. that was fast.

1811
01:16:19.371 --> 01:16:21.373
I want to fire myself.

1812
01:16:21.373 --> 01:16:23.249
I'm so sorry.

1813
01:16:23.249 --> 01:16:26.336
I know you've done so much.
but I don't want to do this job.

1814
01:16:26.336 --> 01:16:27.962
It's-- It's--

1815
01:16:27.962 --> 01:16:30.840
It's not me. and--

1816
01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:32.634
Finally. Just...

1817
01:16:32.634 --> 01:16:34.177
Finally! Finally.

1818
01:16:34.177 --> 01:16:36.221
I've been waiting
for you to realize this.

1819
01:16:40.642 --> 01:16:42.977
- You knew?
- Mm. yeah.

1820
01:16:42.977 --> 01:16:44.229
Emma...

1821
01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:47.065
you have
so many talents.

1822
01:16:47.065 --> 01:16:50.193
Putting up with bureaucracy?
Not one of 'em.

1823
01:16:50.193 --> 01:16:52.404
Oh!

1824
01:16:52.404 --> 01:16:53.988
Well...

1825
01:16:53.988 --> 01:16:56.074
why didn't you say anything?

1826
01:16:56.074 --> 01:16:58.326
You know. I've never had
any success telling someone

1827
01:16:58.326 --> 01:17:01.204
that their dream
is not the right fit for them.

1828
01:17:01.204 --> 01:17:03.498
You needed
to figure it out for yourself.

1829
01:17:03.498 --> 01:17:05.667
I'm glad you finally did.

1830
01:17:05.667 --> 01:17:07.627
'cause...

1831
01:17:07.627 --> 01:17:10.171
I was running out
of ways to annoy you.

1832
01:17:11.464 --> 01:17:13.174
Goodnight.

1833
01:17:21.391 --> 01:17:23.852
Ohh!

1834
01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:30.483
Are you leaving me?

1835
01:17:30.483 --> 01:17:31.693
Paolo.

1836
01:17:33.987 --> 01:17:35.613
What are you doing here?

1837
01:17:35.613 --> 01:17:37.323
I flew home
to work all this out.

1838
01:17:38.533 --> 01:17:40.493
Where are you going?

1839
01:17:40.493 --> 01:17:42.954
To Italy.
to come find you.

1840
01:17:46.875 --> 01:17:48.918
I am never leaving you.

1841
01:17:52.005 --> 01:17:54.215
Oh. I love you so much.

1842
01:18:00.847 --> 01:18:02.557
I talked to my family.

1843
01:18:02.557 --> 01:18:03.975
and we thought that--

1844
01:18:03.975 --> 01:18:06.353
- Mm.
- Why are you shaking your head?

1845
01:18:06.353 --> 01:18:07.812
I'm not even done talking.

1846
01:18:07.812 --> 01:18:10.148
Because all you have
ever wanted to do

1847
01:18:10.148 --> 01:18:12.150
is run your family business.

1848
01:18:12.150 --> 01:18:14.861
live in Italy
with your family.

1849
01:18:14.861 --> 01:18:16.654
have a bunch of kids
running around.

1850
01:18:16.654 --> 01:18:18.156
some local wine.

1851
01:18:18.156 --> 01:18:20.909
maybe get your own boat.
and explore the coast.

1852
01:18:20.909 --> 01:18:23.161
That is true. yes.

1853
01:18:23.161 --> 01:18:25.997
but I don't want to do
any of it without you.

1854
01:18:25.997 --> 01:18:27.624
And I don't want
to be the reason

1855
01:18:27.624 --> 01:18:29.959
you don't do any of it.

1856
01:18:32.545 --> 01:18:34.047
Let me show you something.

1857
01:18:38.593 --> 01:18:40.387
What is it?

1858
01:18:42.347 --> 01:18:43.848
Your five-year plan.

1859
01:18:43.848 --> 01:18:45.934
Watch this.

1860
01:18:46.935 --> 01:18:50.522
No more five-year plan.

1861
01:18:50.522 --> 01:18:52.857
Except for this part.

1862
01:18:52.857 --> 01:18:53.817
Of course...

1863
01:18:53.817 --> 01:18:56.403
Of course.

1864
01:18:57.696 --> 01:18:59.322
And...

1865
01:18:59.322 --> 01:19:02.158
I'm pretty sure
I quit my job today.

1866
01:19:02.158 --> 01:19:03.451
Emma!

1867
01:19:03.451 --> 01:19:05.203
And I plan to do it officially
in the morning.

1868
01:19:05.203 --> 01:19:06.705
Why?

1869
01:19:06.705 --> 01:19:09.290
I'm done letting other people
make our decisions for us.

1870
01:19:10.750 --> 01:19:12.127
Good to know.

1871
01:19:16.923 --> 01:19:18.216
Anything else?

1872
01:19:18.216 --> 01:19:21.219
Mm. Yes.

1873
01:19:21.219 --> 01:19:23.263
Do you remember
those videos about the veil?

1874
01:19:23.263 --> 01:19:24.556
Mm-hmm.

1875
01:19:24.556 --> 01:19:27.058
Lily and I plan
to expand those into a series.

1876
01:19:27.058 --> 01:19:29.352
Art and history
are all around us.

1877
01:19:29.352 --> 01:19:31.771
and I think we should
be talking about them.

1878
01:19:31.771 --> 01:19:34.524
Of course.
because you are--

1879
01:19:34.524 --> 01:19:35.900
Oh. you're gonna say it?

1880
01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:37.569
"Everyone's
Favorite Art Historian".

1881
01:19:37.569 --> 01:19:39.112
Oh. you really--
Oh. wow.

1882
01:19:39.112 --> 01:19:41.740
You too?

1883
01:19:41.740 --> 01:19:43.742
Are you done?

1884
01:19:43.742 --> 01:19:45.410
Or there are more surprises?

1885
01:19:45.410 --> 01:19:46.578
No. I'm done.

1886
01:19:46.578 --> 01:19:47.746
Oh. wait!

1887
01:19:47.746 --> 01:19:48.872
Ah!

1888
01:19:48.872 --> 01:19:50.623
Matteo is in love with Lily.

1889
01:19:50.623 --> 01:19:52.250
- Wait! What?
- Yes!

1890
01:19:52.250 --> 01:19:54.085
We left the veil
in the shop!

1891
01:19:54.085 --> 01:19:56.046
What did you think
was gonna happen?

1892
01:19:59.799 --> 01:20:01.760
♪ You asked me
to sign my name ♪

1893
01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:03.303
♪ On a piece of paper ♪

1894
01:20:03.303 --> 01:20:04.929
♪ In black ink ♪

1895
01:20:04.929 --> 01:20:08.725
♪ So I signed it
"P.S.. I love you" ♪

1896
01:20:12.103 --> 01:20:14.314
♪ Whoa-oh-oh ♪

1897
01:20:14.314 --> 01:20:16.149
♪ You're finally in my life ♪

1898
01:20:18.026 --> 01:20:20.445
♪ Whoa-oh-oh ♪

1899
01:20:20.445 --> 01:20:23.740
♪ You're finally in my life
forevermore ♪

1900
01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:26.826
♪ Whoa-oh-oh ♪

1901
01:20:26.826 --> 01:20:29.996
♪ You're finally in my life
forevermore ♪

1902
01:20:31.790 --> 01:20:32.707
Go!

1903
01:20:41.383 --> 01:20:44.636
I am not prepared to admit
to the power of the veil.

1904
01:20:44.636 --> 01:20:45.887
but I will say

1905
01:20:45.887 --> 01:20:47.347
we have been
to a lot of weddings lately.

1906
01:20:47.347 --> 01:20:48.473
Oh. okay!

1907
01:20:48.473 --> 01:20:49.933
How's Matteo doing

1908
01:20:49.933 --> 01:20:51.476
in the store on his own.
with you guys in Italy?

1909
01:20:51.476 --> 01:20:52.727
So well.

1910
01:20:52.727 --> 01:20:55.313
and the replica veil
has become a best-seller.

1911
01:20:55.313 --> 01:20:58.149
I love these long weekends
where we get to be together.

1912
01:20:58.149 --> 01:21:00.193
and we get to hear
all about your videos.

1913
01:21:00.193 --> 01:21:01.403
And we can go antiquing.

1914
01:21:01.403 --> 01:21:03.655
And we can hear about
you living in Italy.

1915
01:21:03.655 --> 01:21:04.823
And we can go antiquing!

1916
01:21:04.823 --> 01:21:06.825
And we can make
a reservation for brunch.

1917
01:21:06.825 --> 01:21:08.201
And we can go antiquing!

1918
01:21:08.201 --> 01:21:09.411
Perfect.

1919
01:21:10.620 --> 01:21:12.497
Speaking of antiques...

1920
01:21:12.497 --> 01:21:14.874
do you remember that Venetian
mirror that I love?

1921
01:21:14.874 --> 01:21:15.917
Oh. you sent us photos.

1922
01:21:15.917 --> 01:21:17.919
Mm-hmm.

1923
01:21:17.919 --> 01:21:19.462
Paolo bought it for me
for my birthday!

1924
01:21:19.462 --> 01:21:20.213
- Really?
- What?

1925
01:21:20.213 --> 01:21:21.715
Yes. It's so beautiful.

1926
01:21:21.715 --> 01:21:24.467
Please tell me you can come out
and see it soon-- and me?

1927
01:21:24.467 --> 01:21:27.012
Of course! Of course
we'll make that happen.

1928
01:21:27.012 --> 01:21:28.388
You know.
I'm thinking. though.

1929
01:21:28.388 --> 01:21:30.223
that it might have
an interesting history

1930
01:21:30.223 --> 01:21:31.683
that you need to look into.

1931
01:21:31.683 --> 01:21:33.184
Hmm...

1932
01:21:33.184 --> 01:21:35.729
you know. I was actually
thinking the exact same thing.

1933
01:21:35.729 --> 01:21:37.355
- Of course.
- Matteo and Lily

1934
01:21:37.355 --> 01:21:38.940
are coming to Italy
for their honeymoon.

1935
01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:41.067
so I thought
I would do some research.

1936
01:21:41.067 --> 01:21:43.111
and maybe we could do
some videos while they're there.

1937
01:21:43.111 --> 01:21:44.612
- because--
- Because you are...

1938
01:21:44.612 --> 01:21:46.865
"Everyone's
Favorite Art Historian!"

1939
01:21:46.865 --> 01:21:48.033
You're gonna do it
every time?

1940
01:21:48.033 --> 01:21:49.367
Yeah. we're gonna do it
every time.

1941
01:21:49.367 --> 01:21:51.036
Every time!

1942
01:21:51.036 --> 01:21:52.579
Speaking of honeymoons. though...

1943
01:21:52.579 --> 01:21:54.914
Oh. I know. okay?
We'll make it happen.

1944
01:21:54.914 --> 01:21:56.416
We will.

1945
01:21:56.416 --> 01:21:58.918
We also need to decide
where the veil's going next.

1946
01:21:58.918 --> 01:22:00.712
Do you guys think it's time
for it to go back to New York?

1947
01:22:00.712 --> 01:22:02.297
To Nick's sisters?

1948
01:22:02.297 --> 01:22:03.715
Have I dropped enough hints?

1949
01:22:03.715 --> 01:22:06.009
Yes. I would love that.
if I could take it to them.

1950
01:22:06.009 --> 01:22:07.344
Then it's settled.

1951
01:22:07.344 --> 01:22:08.595
Oh. but what about
the christening gown?

1952
01:22:08.595 --> 01:22:10.013
Do you want me to send that
to New York. too?

1953
01:22:10.013 --> 01:22:11.806
I...

1954
01:22:11.806 --> 01:22:16.019
think I should probably
keep that with me in Italy

1955
01:22:16.019 --> 01:22:19.564
for at least
the next seven months or so.

1956
01:22:19.564 --> 01:22:20.815
Are you--?

1957
01:22:25.070 --> 01:22:27.238
Oh. my gosh. that's amazing!

1958
01:22:30.033 --> 01:22:32.452
Best news.

1959
01:22:36.623 --> 01:22:38.041
Aww.

1960
01:22:38.041 --> 01:22:39.626
Time for our toast.

1961
01:22:39.626 --> 01:22:42.629
Two champagnes
and one bubbly apple juice.

1962
01:22:44.881 --> 01:22:46.424
Ahh...

1963
01:22:46.424 --> 01:22:48.093
to friendship.

1964
01:22:48.093 --> 01:22:49.552
To the veil.

1965
01:22:49.552 --> 01:22:53.515
And to all the amazing women
who have worn it.

1966
01:22:53.515 --> 01:22:55.767
Aw!

1967
01:23:05.318 --> 01:23:07.821
So. in the first hour
of meeting Paolo.

1968
01:23:07.821 --> 01:23:10.323
he helped me buy a ticket
for the <i>vaporetto--</i>

1969
01:23:10.323 --> 01:23:11.282
True.

1970
01:23:11.282 --> 01:23:12.617
...Helped me with my Italian--

1971
01:23:12.617 --> 01:23:13.618
Also true.

1972
01:23:13.618 --> 01:23:15.453
- ...Found my lost ticket--
- Yes.

1973
01:23:15.453 --> 01:23:16.955
...Saved me
from falling into a canal--

1974
01:23:16.955 --> 01:23:18.456
Naturally.

1975
01:23:18.456 --> 01:23:19.749
...Helped me find the lace shop
that made my veil--

1976
01:23:19.749 --> 01:23:20.959
My shop.

1977
01:23:20.959 --> 01:23:22.627
- ...And bought me coffee.
-"Espresso".

1978
01:23:22.627 --> 01:23:23.962
So...

1979
01:23:23.962 --> 01:23:25.839
naturally.
I fell in love with him.

1980
01:23:25.839 --> 01:23:27.799
These things happen in Italy.

1981
01:23:30.844 --> 01:23:31.886
<i>Ciao!</i>
