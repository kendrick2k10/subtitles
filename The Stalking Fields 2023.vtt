Please. Please.

No. Please. Please.
Please. Please don't.

00:02:45.643 --> 00:02:48.603
Please.
No. no. please.

7
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.171
Don't... don't do that!

8
00:02:58.917 --> 00:03:01.268
Please. John.
just let me talk to him. Okay?

9
00:03:01.442 --> 00:03:02.573
<i>Absolutely fucking not.</i>

10
00:03:02.747 --> 00:03:04.662
Come on.
It's been months.

11
00:03:04.836 --> 00:03:06.396
- You don't even care. do you?
- I care.

12
00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:08.275
I care.
What do you think I'm...

13
00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:10.102
- No. you don't.
- Yes. I do.

14
00:03:10.277 --> 00:03:12.366
No. that's part of
what I'm talking about. Okay?

15
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.107
The only person that
matters to Rachel is Rachel.

16
00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.285
Where is it? Hmm?

17
00:03:19.764 --> 00:03:21.288
Give it to me now.

18
00:03:21.462 --> 00:03:22.702
Oh. is this where we are going?

19
00:03:22.767 --> 00:03:24.813
Yeah.

20
00:03:27.772 --> 00:03:29.296
Okay. Slow it down there.

21
00:03:30.645 --> 00:03:31.907
You know what?

22
00:03:33.561 --> 00:03:36.433
You are such a fucking pussy.

23
00:03:36.607 --> 00:03:38.479
Baby. come on.
Why would I...

24
00:03:38.653 --> 00:03:40.892
You're a whore not a thief.
Give me the fucking ring now.

25
00:03:40.916 --> 00:03:42.613
- <i>No.</i>
- Yeah.

26
00:03:42.787 --> 00:03:44.833
Well. I am his mother. okay?
And he's my only baby.

27
00:03:45.007 --> 00:03:46.922
<i>You had your chance.
You fucked it up.</i>

28
00:03:47.096 --> 00:03:50.360
That is not fair. And that...
And you know that's not true.

29
00:03:52.101 --> 00:03:55.060
Nothing? I'm walking out
right now. you got nothing?

30
00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:57.846
Let me see this purse.
Give me this... ow!

31
00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.543
You wanna hit. huh?

32
00:03:59.717 --> 00:04:02.633
I paid you to leave.
not to steal my shit.

33
00:04:04.505 --> 00:04:05.810
I said slow it down.

34
00:04:06.985 --> 00:04:08.509
I'm not a fucking whore.

35
00:04:09.553 --> 00:04:11.294
Dude. what the fuck?
Come on.

36
00:04:11.468 --> 00:04:15.516
So you know what?
You pay for it for once.

37
00:04:17.866 --> 00:04:19.433
<i>You're a fucking psycho.</i>

38
00:04:19.607 --> 00:04:21.565
<i>- You're a fucking psycho.
- Stay out.</i>

39
00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.437
<i>Don't ever
fucking call me again.</i>

40
00:04:23.611 --> 00:04:25.569
<i>You're such a fucking psycho.</i>

41
00:04:25.743 --> 00:04:27.895
<i>And you know something. you're
not gonna bring her back.</i>

42
00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.095
<i>and it's your fucking fault
you drunk piece of shit.</i>

43
00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:33.185
<i>Keep walking.</i>

44
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.186
<i>Come on.
I was just playing around.</i>

45
00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:35.579
<i>Fuck you.</i>

46
00:04:35.753 --> 00:04:36.753
<i>Jojo. good. copy.</i>

47
00:04:36.885 --> 00:04:38.626
<i>What the fuck. man?</i>

48
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.715
<i>JoJo.
This is Stalker Two.</i>

49
00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.848
<i>Standing by for timeline.
All copy? Over.</i>

50
00:04:45.981 --> 00:04:47.504
<i>Stalker Two. solid copy.</i>

51
00:04:47.678 --> 00:04:50.681
<i>Stand by for Stalker One.</i>

52
00:04:50.855 --> 00:04:53.423
. <i>go.</i>
<i>Stay frosty. motherfuckers.</i>

53
00:04:53.597 --> 00:04:56.165
<i>Proceed with plan.</i>

54
00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:58.123
<i>Stalker Two. roger that.</i>

55
00:05:20.145 --> 00:05:22.191
General Santiago
is calling in. sir.

56
00:05:23.105 --> 00:05:24.236
Patch him in.

57
00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:27.631
General Santiago.
Colonel Roake reporting.

58
00:05:27.805 --> 00:05:28.893
<i>At ease Colonel.</i>

59
00:05:29.067 --> 00:05:30.591
<i>Status report?</i>

60
00:05:30.765 --> 00:05:33.158
Sir. I have five fresh
new assignments inbound

61
00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:35.073
and Chief Woodman is en route.

62
00:05:35.247 --> 00:05:36.684
<i>Copy. ETA?</i>

63
00:05:36.858 --> 00:05:38.599
Five mikes. sir.

64
00:05:38.773 --> 00:05:40.296
<i>Is that Israeli bitch there yet?</i>

65
00:05:41.253 --> 00:05:43.778
Thank you for the compliment.

66
00:05:43.952 --> 00:05:45.780
<i>- Wasn't a compliment.</i>
- No?

67
00:05:45.954 --> 00:05:48.391
Where I come from. if you're
referred to as a bitch

68
00:05:48.565 --> 00:05:50.350
means you're doing your job.

69
00:05:50.524 --> 00:05:51.960
<i>Then you should get a promotion.</i>

70
00:05:52.134 --> 00:05:53.831
<i>Just stay the fuck
out of the way.</i>

71
00:05:54.005 --> 00:05:56.051
<i>You've done your part.
Now let us do ours.</i>

72
00:05:56.225 --> 00:05:58.401
We'll do the right thing
at whatever cost.

73
00:06:00.142 --> 00:06:01.404
<i>Keep me posted. Colonel Roake.</i>

74
00:06:02.274 --> 00:06:04.102
Copy that. sir.

75
00:06:04.276 --> 00:06:06.116
<i>I hand-picked you
for this program. You get it?</i>

76
00:06:08.846 --> 00:06:10.457
<i>Don't drop the ball on me now.</i>

77
00:06:10.631 --> 00:06:13.111
<i>Too close to the finish line.</i>

78
00:06:13.285 --> 00:06:14.939
<i>I want a status report
in 48 hours</i>

79
00:06:15.113 --> 00:06:16.854
<i>and a clinical eval
on Woodman post hunt.</i>

80
00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.161
Understood.

81
00:06:19.335 --> 00:06:20.989
<i>This man in particular</i>

82
00:06:21.163 --> 00:06:24.209
<i>is of special interest to us.
Marcus Woodman.</i>

83
00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:26.342
<i>You do well for him.</i>

84
00:06:26.516 --> 00:06:28.170
<i>there may be
a brigadier general spot</i>

85
00:06:28.344 --> 00:06:29.984
<i>in our covert ops unit
here in Washington.</i>

86
00:06:30.302 --> 00:06:31.695
I know the stakes.

87
00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:34.089
<i>Good. Carry on.</i>

88
00:06:38.615 --> 00:06:39.660
Great day.

89
00:06:47.363 --> 00:06:49.409
Woodman's transport
is ten minutes out. sir.

90
00:06:49.583 --> 00:06:50.863
I want you to keep an eye on it.

91
00:07:07.252 --> 00:07:10.517
<i>You're gonna love it.
Trust me.</i>

92
00:07:11.953 --> 00:07:14.303
Okay. Now I know that you said
you don't wanna do anything.

93
00:07:14.477 --> 00:07:15.609
but...

94
00:07:17.045 --> 00:07:18.089
here you go.

95
00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:23.617
Stop.

96
00:07:23.791 --> 00:07:24.922
<i>Blue Jay 1. out copy. over.</i>

97
00:07:25.096 --> 00:07:26.184
Babe. you okay?

98
00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:29.231
- Babe.
- Get...

99
00:07:29.405 --> 00:07:30.687
- Babe. it's just a present.
- Just get away.

100
00:07:30.711 --> 00:07:32.452
- Babe.
- Jess. get away.

101
00:07:32.626 --> 00:07:34.584
- Get away. Get away. Get out.
- Babe? Marcus!

102
00:07:34.758 --> 00:07:36.499
Just get out.
Get out. Get out.

103
00:07:36.673 --> 00:07:38.022
<i>It's just a box. Marcus.</i>

104
00:07:38.196 --> 00:07:39.676
<i>Marcus. please. it's just a box.</i>

105
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.330
<i>Get out!</i>

106
00:07:41.504 --> 00:07:42.636
<i>Please. Please. calm down.</i>

107
00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:44.289
<i>Please. make it stop.</i>

108
00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:47.379
<i>Please. it's just a box.</i>

109
00:07:47.554 --> 00:07:49.991
<i>Please. calm down. Please.</i>

110
00:07:50.165 --> 00:07:52.733
- Sir.
- Top. come in.

111
00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:55.300
- Thank you. sir.
- I called you here

112
00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:57.435
because I wanna talk to you
about our new recruit.

113
00:07:58.782 --> 00:07:59.914
We really need this one.

114
00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.438
Washington is telling us that

115
00:08:02.612 --> 00:08:04.658
if we pull this off
without a glitch...

116
00:08:06.181 --> 00:08:07.312
we get fully funded.

117
00:08:07.878 --> 00:08:09.227
Dream come true. sir.

118
00:08:10.054 --> 00:08:11.142
That it is.

119
00:08:17.584 --> 00:08:20.282
We pulled all the footage from
various devices in the home.

120
00:08:22.719 --> 00:08:24.939
Senior Chief Marcus Woodman.

121
00:08:26.593 --> 00:08:28.029
<i>911. what's your emergency?</i>

122
00:08:28.203 --> 00:08:29.944
Uh. it's my husband.

123
00:08:30.118 --> 00:08:32.118
He has locked himself
in the bathroom with his gun.

124
00:08:32.599 --> 00:08:33.861
Please help.

125
00:08:34.035 --> 00:08:35.471
Marcus.

126
00:08:36.341 --> 00:08:37.821
No. I don't know.

127
00:08:37.995 --> 00:08:39.780
I mean. he's talking
but not to me.

128
00:08:40.432 --> 00:08:43.566
Marcus. please.
Just come out baby. Please.

129
00:08:44.698 --> 00:08:47.831
I know you're in there.
Come back to me.

130
00:08:48.571 --> 00:08:51.922
I need you. Marcus.
I want you.

131
00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:57.624
Marcus. Marcus. Marcus.

132
00:09:01.149 --> 00:09:04.369
<i>Never scare me
like that again. please. babe.</i>

133
00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:06.894
Sir. it's hard to believe
all those stories.

134
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.650
Yeah. well you better believe
them 'cause they're all true.

135
00:09:12.203 --> 00:09:14.243
Behavioral avoidance
can happen to the best of them.

136
00:09:16.033 --> 00:09:17.905
The man spent
the last four months

137
00:09:18.079 --> 00:09:19.907
at AMACORP's
Prime Psych Facility

138
00:09:20.081 --> 00:09:23.998
being probed and tested
and evaluated.

139
00:09:24.999 --> 00:09:26.870
Voodoo bullshit if you ask me.

140
00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:30.178
Now. it's up to us to
get him back in the saddle...

141
00:09:31.353 --> 00:09:32.528
for Ghost.

142
00:09:33.398 --> 00:09:34.791
Ghost Recon.

143
00:09:34.965 --> 00:09:36.097
Exactly.

144
00:09:37.272 --> 00:09:38.752
Never met anyone up for that.

145
00:09:40.362 --> 00:09:44.584
And Top.
you and I we pull this off.

146
00:09:44.758 --> 00:09:46.890
it's gonna be
a huge win for both of us.

147
00:09:48.152 --> 00:09:50.198
Sir. he's arrived.
Would you like him here?

148
00:09:50.807 --> 00:09:52.592
- That's fine.
- Sir.

149
00:10:10.392 --> 00:10:11.785
Damn! I'm good.

150
00:10:11.959 --> 00:10:15.049
I mean. it was okay.

151
00:10:15.527 --> 00:10:18.226
I mean. just five out of
five cans okay or was it...

152
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.750
- Easy.
- I got it. It's okay.

153
00:10:20.924 --> 00:10:22.622
I know. I just...

154
00:10:22.796 --> 00:10:24.536
Uh...

155
00:10:26.103 --> 00:10:29.106
Anyway. do you wanna go set
the cans back up or?

156
00:10:29.846 --> 00:10:31.152
Yeah. For you.

157
00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:33.633
Oh. no. I'm not really
feeling it today.

158
00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.376
Look. if you don't
wanna talk about it.

159
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:40.248
you don't have to. but you can.

160
00:10:46.994 --> 00:10:48.169
I don't know.

161
00:10:53.043 --> 00:10:54.436
I just. uh...

162
00:11:00.703 --> 00:11:03.140
it's like doing good
doesn't feel good anymore.

163
00:11:06.491 --> 00:11:08.624
Like the right thing
became the wrong thing...

164
00:11:10.104 --> 00:11:11.583
if that makes any sense.

165
00:11:14.325 --> 00:11:16.023
I mean.
if it makes sense to you.

166
00:11:16.197 --> 00:11:17.502
then that's all that matters.

167
00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:20.288
And maybe you could
go to that place

168
00:11:20.462 --> 00:11:23.073
and you could talk to somebody
and maybe they'll understand.

169
00:11:23.247 --> 00:11:25.162
Hmm.

170
00:11:26.076 --> 00:11:28.818
Either way.
I'm here for you.

171
00:11:31.865 --> 00:11:33.083
You got this.

172
00:11:50.448 --> 00:11:51.754
The wife?

173
00:11:52.494 --> 00:11:55.715
She passed away unfortunately
a while after he got out.

174
00:11:56.454 --> 00:11:58.282
I think it's why
he joined the program.

175
00:11:58.456 --> 00:11:59.806
Nothing left for him at home.

176
00:12:00.981 --> 00:12:02.460
That's tough stuff right there.

177
00:12:04.549 --> 00:12:05.637
Yeah. it is.

178
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:11.295
Is he on board?

179
00:12:11.469 --> 00:12:12.819
He will be.

180
00:12:12.993 --> 00:12:14.908
Once he sees it's not about him.

181
00:12:15.082 --> 00:12:17.345
it's about the men and women
who will come after him.

182
00:12:17.519 --> 00:12:18.868
He is a soldier.

183
00:12:21.131 --> 00:12:22.524
He's not just any soldier.

184
00:12:24.178 --> 00:12:26.354
The man
is an exceptional Navy Seal.

185
00:12:26.528 --> 00:12:29.487
This is the fast track
back to where he belongs.

186
00:13:03.521 --> 00:13:06.481
- Hey. I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

187
00:13:06.655 --> 00:13:08.352
Yeah.

188
00:13:08.526 --> 00:13:10.417
You go deal with your friends.
They're here for you.

189
00:13:10.441 --> 00:13:11.747
I'm here for you.

190
00:13:12.922 --> 00:13:13.922
Thanks.

191
00:13:20.843 --> 00:13:22.003
Mind if I hang out over here?

192
00:13:22.149 --> 00:13:23.759
Mingling is not really my thing.

193
00:13:23.933 --> 00:13:25.543
Sure. I'm just
flipping these burgers

194
00:13:25.717 --> 00:13:26.956
pretending like I know
what I'm doing.

195
00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.808
Honestly. I like it.

196
00:13:29.373 --> 00:13:30.505
Greg.

197
00:13:31.332 --> 00:13:33.029
Marcus. nice to meet you.

198
00:13:33.203 --> 00:13:34.596
Like the poet king.

199
00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:36.728
- Or the assassin.
- Oh. yeah.

200
00:13:36.903 --> 00:13:38.383
Depends on
how you look at it I guess.

201
00:13:39.035 --> 00:13:40.167
That's true.

202
00:13:42.604 --> 00:13:43.910
Thanks for not saying that.

203
00:13:44.693 --> 00:13:45.693
Saying what?

204
00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:47.174
Uh. when people meet me.

205
00:13:47.348 --> 00:13:48.716
they usually can't wait
to get it out.

206
00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:50.090
Thank you for your service.

207
00:13:50.264 --> 00:13:52.092
Uh. yeah.
You guys don't like that.

208
00:13:52.266 --> 00:13:54.094
And I don't blame you.

209
00:13:54.268 --> 00:13:56.159
I think living a good life
is the best thanks I can give.

210
00:13:56.183 --> 00:13:57.227
Exactly.

211
00:13:58.663 --> 00:13:59.823
Jess said you're getting out?

212
00:14:01.231 --> 00:14:02.319
That's the plan.

213
00:14:32.001 --> 00:14:33.394
Took you long enough.

214
00:14:34.395 --> 00:14:35.526
What's that?

215
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.006
To get here.

216
00:14:38.268 --> 00:14:39.574
Car trouble?

217
00:14:41.793 --> 00:14:43.186
I'll drive next time.

218
00:14:44.274 --> 00:14:45.274
Shit.

219
00:14:45.406 --> 00:14:47.016
Heard about your wife.

220
00:14:49.671 --> 00:14:51.107
She's why I'm here.

221
00:14:51.281 --> 00:14:52.717
I never picked
one up along the way.

222
00:14:53.501 --> 00:14:54.850
It's too much to carry.

223
00:14:55.633 --> 00:14:57.374
- We ready to go?
- You know that mission.

224
00:14:59.681 --> 00:15:00.856
Is it true?

225
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:02.423
What's it to you. man?

226
00:15:02.597 --> 00:15:06.557
It's just.
you know. over 200 kills.

227
00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:09.125
You go on a Rambo and shit.

228
00:15:09.299 --> 00:15:12.563
And then. of course. you had
to put down your own objective.

229
00:15:13.782 --> 00:15:16.785
It's too wounded
to move so they say.

230
00:15:20.006 --> 00:15:21.833
So they say.

231
00:15:22.008 --> 00:15:24.208
You know. that's the thing
about Lone Survivor missions.

232
00:15:24.532 --> 00:15:28.188
It's only ever one version
of the story. yours.

233
00:15:28.362 --> 00:15:29.841
Ops aren't always clean.

234
00:15:30.016 --> 00:15:31.616
Oh. I'm not afraid
to get my hands dirty.

235
00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:33.889
I can see that.

236
00:15:37.632 --> 00:15:40.200
You know. the most
dangerous animal in the world.

237
00:15:40.374 --> 00:15:41.592
it's a desperate one.

238
00:15:42.724 --> 00:15:46.554
Had a mission like
yours once. Siberia.

239
00:15:46.728 --> 00:15:48.121
three days in the mountains.

240
00:15:49.035 --> 00:15:51.689
Snowstorm.
Signal was shit.

241
00:15:51.863 --> 00:15:54.562
Intel was wrong. like usual.

242
00:15:55.389 --> 00:15:59.219
We were hurt.
bleeding bad. no ammo.

243
00:15:59.393 --> 00:16:01.569
The forest was too thick
to land anything in.

244
00:16:01.743 --> 00:16:03.353
So we had to climb to elevation.

245
00:16:04.311 --> 00:16:06.835
Snow you've never seen
in your fucking life.

246
00:16:08.924 --> 00:16:10.665
About 15 hours in
we start getting tracked

247
00:16:10.839 --> 00:16:11.971
by a pack of wolves.

248
00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:15.191
Wolves.

249
00:16:15.713 --> 00:16:17.541
It doesn't happen
like you think.

250
00:16:18.194 --> 00:16:19.979
They don't come fast. they wait.

251
00:16:21.154 --> 00:16:23.634
They stalk you.
They scout ahead.

252
00:16:25.419 --> 00:16:27.508
They find the perfect
ground to attack.

253
00:16:27.682 --> 00:16:28.988
Just like us.

254
00:16:30.728 --> 00:16:33.644
My team and I. we took
a stand and we waited.

255
00:16:34.384 --> 00:16:36.125
Those wolves knew
what it was too.

256
00:16:37.474 --> 00:16:39.781
'Cause here comes the biggest
motherfucker they got.

257
00:16:40.521 --> 00:16:44.612
Gray. this black chest...

258
00:16:44.786 --> 00:16:47.006
these big yellow eyes.

259
00:16:48.703 --> 00:16:50.444
I knew when
I saw that motherfucker

260
00:16:50.618 --> 00:16:53.751
a sacrifice would have
to be made one way or another.

261
00:16:55.492 --> 00:16:56.885
I let him get close.

262
00:16:58.191 --> 00:16:59.801
And when he launched
I stuck my hand

263
00:16:59.975 --> 00:17:03.109
in that motherfuckers mouth
and I pulled him close.

264
00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.242
I was the last thing
he ever saw.

265
00:17:08.375 --> 00:17:11.682
So I'm still breathing
and he's not.

266
00:17:12.683 --> 00:17:14.294
- Lucky for you.
- You know.

267
00:17:14.468 --> 00:17:15.904
they talk like
you're some big hero.

268
00:17:16.905 --> 00:17:20.648
Well. my team is still alive.
your guy isn't.

269
00:17:23.172 --> 00:17:24.913
<i>Claver. ready for Woodman.</i>

270
00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:28.830
Time to let
the dog off the leash.

271
00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.444
You're wrong.

272
00:17:35.228 --> 00:17:36.490
How's that?

273
00:17:37.273 --> 00:17:40.755
The most dangerous animal.
it isn't the desperate one.

274
00:17:42.017 --> 00:17:44.367
It's one with nothing to lose.

275
00:17:48.545 --> 00:17:50.069
Ready?
One. two.

276
00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:29.412
I'll get him back to you

277
00:18:29.586 --> 00:18:30.848
after I debrief him.

278
00:18:31.501 --> 00:18:33.024
Top. take care of him.
Will you?

279
00:18:34.417 --> 00:18:35.462
Copy that sir.

280
00:18:36.724 --> 00:18:37.986
Thank you.

281
00:18:38.943 --> 00:18:40.031
Chief.

282
00:18:43.513 --> 00:18:44.601
I'm Colonel Roake.

283
00:18:45.776 --> 00:18:46.908
Good to meet you. son.

284
00:18:48.649 --> 00:18:49.693
Come on in.

285
00:19:00.313 --> 00:19:01.705
<i>Welcome to the new</i>

286
00:19:01.879 --> 00:19:03.533

How you doing. son?

291
00:19:40.004 --> 00:19:41.354
Fine.
Just ready to go.

292
00:19:42.616 --> 00:19:44.357
- You packed and strapped?
- Of course.

293
00:19:44.531 --> 00:19:46.291
Checked it twice
like I have been trained to.

294
00:19:46.968 --> 00:19:48.274
- Stay alert.
- Stay alive.

295
00:19:52.365 --> 00:19:53.583
You know. nerves are good.

296
00:19:54.236 --> 00:19:56.325
- Keeps you sharp.
- I'm not nervous.

297
00:19:57.065 --> 00:19:58.849
Hey. Top.
you mind if I have a word?

298
00:20:01.939 --> 00:20:03.071
Yeah.

299
00:20:09.556 --> 00:20:10.818
So. Marcus Woodman?

300
00:20:12.559 --> 00:20:13.821
Yeah.

301
00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.390
To be honest.

302
00:20:17.564 --> 00:20:18.671
I've heard some
wild ass shit about him.

303
00:20:18.695 --> 00:20:20.567
Hmm.
I hear ya.

304
00:20:20.741 --> 00:20:23.309
But we're the only ones who
can relate to this man. right?

305
00:20:24.832 --> 00:20:27.269
Like him or not.
he's one of ours.

306
00:20:27.443 --> 00:20:28.531
He's not one of mine.

307
00:20:30.229 --> 00:20:32.389
You kill one of our own.
there's no excuse. Not for me.

308
00:20:35.016 --> 00:20:36.191
Yeah.

309
00:20:36.757 --> 00:20:37.932
Hey.

310
00:20:40.848 --> 00:20:42.458
- Hey.
- Hello.

311
00:20:42.632 --> 00:20:44.721
- Hey.
- Hello.

Oh. God. Help.
Help me. Help me. please.

314
00:20:52.381 --> 00:20:54.209
Please.
Please. get me out of here.

Please. Please. Please.

316
00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:00.433
Why does my head hurt?

317
00:21:00.607 --> 00:21:01.967
Please help me out of here.
Please.

318
00:21:02.435 --> 00:21:03.827
I don't fucking know.

319
00:21:04.001 --> 00:21:05.307
I didn't do anything. please.

320
00:21:05.481 --> 00:21:06.721
Just calm down. Just calm down.

321
00:21:06.874 --> 00:21:08.049
Shut up. bitch!

322
00:21:08.223 --> 00:21:09.746
Please. somebody help.

323
00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.835
Help!
Hey! Somebody!

324
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.142
Let me out!

325
00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:16.971
It was just me and my boyfriend

326
00:21:17.145 --> 00:21:18.755
and we were having dinner
and then. uh...

327
00:21:19.408 --> 00:21:22.585
Yeah. let... let's start to...
I... I was out at the bar.

328
00:21:22.759 --> 00:21:24.544
Yo. I don't remember shit.

329
00:21:24.718 --> 00:21:27.895
I... I had just...
I was coming home from work.

330
00:21:28.069 --> 00:21:29.244
Let me out!

331
00:21:29.418 --> 00:21:31.072
Let me out! Let me out!

332
00:21:31.246 --> 00:21:32.789
- Keep it down. man.
- We're being watched.

333
00:21:32.813 --> 00:21:34.075
What?

334
00:21:34.249 --> 00:21:35.816
Look. we're being watched.

335
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:38.427
We're being watched.
Look there. Look. Look.

336
00:21:38.601 --> 00:21:41.561
Somebody.
anybody. let me out now.

337
00:21:41.735 --> 00:21:45.042
Help us!
Hello! Help!

338
00:21:55.575 --> 00:21:56.880
What number hunt
is this for you?

339
00:21:58.491 --> 00:22:00.144
I don't know.
A few dozen.

340
00:22:01.102 --> 00:22:04.366
And. um. how has your home life
been since treatment?

341
00:22:05.802 --> 00:22:07.064
Excellent. honestly.

342
00:22:08.065 --> 00:22:09.284
Professionally?

343
00:22:11.373 --> 00:22:12.548
Better than ever.

344
00:22:14.594 --> 00:22:17.118
So don't you think
it would be fair

345
00:22:17.292 --> 00:22:19.599
if we give this man
the same chances we gave you?

346
00:22:28.651 --> 00:22:30.174
Yeah. you're right.

347
00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.830
I just had to say something.

348
00:22:34.614 --> 00:22:36.790
Woodman will mainly be
with me and Junior today

349
00:22:36.964 --> 00:22:38.357
I'll keep an eye on him.

350
00:22:40.489 --> 00:22:42.404
How's the little
dumb dumb doing?

351
00:22:45.364 --> 00:22:46.800
He's wound a little
tight right now.

352
00:22:46.974 --> 00:22:48.192
but that's how it goes.

353
00:22:49.237 --> 00:22:51.848
His results will come
once he's been in the hot seat.

354
00:22:52.501 --> 00:22:54.373
Then we'll see if this
is preventative as well.

355
00:23:05.166 --> 00:23:06.167
The fuck are you?

356
00:23:09.649 --> 00:23:11.215
What the fuck?
Get off me.

357
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.348
Hey. hey.
Fuck you man.

358
00:23:13.522 --> 00:23:16.743
Seriously?
Answer me. Hey. hey.

359
00:23:20.094 --> 00:23:21.400
Don't fucking care.

360
00:23:25.969 --> 00:23:27.275
Help me.

361
00:23:45.336 --> 00:23:46.776
Can you just
tell me what's going on?

362
00:23:46.903 --> 00:23:48.688
What's going on?

363
00:23:48.862 --> 00:23:50.385
Person to person. please.

364
00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:55.912
They are ready.

365
00:24:02.049 --> 00:24:05.182

<i>Experimental.

373
00:24:21.111 --> 00:24:22.765
Okay.

374
00:24:22.939 --> 00:24:24.419
<i>The program's trying

What are you talking about?

377
00:24:29.206 --> 00:24:32.993
<i>I'm talking about serving
those who have served you.</i>

378

<i>Giving you an opportunity

379
00:24:35.691 --> 00:24:38.564

<i>The program will start
16 minutes after your release.</i>

381
00:24:42.176 --> 00:24:44.831
<i>Here is where I'm sure
you will have many questions.</i>

382
00:24:45.005 --> 00:24:46.659
I just wanna go home.

383
00:24:46.833 --> 00:24:48.419
No. no. no. You have...
You have the wrong people.

384
00:24:48.443 --> 00:24:51.054
Okay. I haven't done
anything wrong. Please.

385
00:24:51.228 --> 00:24:55.102
<i>You see. there are no accidents.</i>

386
00:24:55.276 --> 00:24:58.845
<i>Each of you.
you're all here for a reason.</i>

387
00:24:59.019 --> 00:25:00.934
<i>Rachel. for instance.</i>

<i>- Wow.</i>
- Fuck this and fuck you.

393
00:25:11.466 --> 00:25:12.598
This is deranged.

394
00:25:12.772 --> 00:25:15.426
<i>Sara. another addict</i>

<i>I mean. I could go on. shall I?</i>

397
00:25:19.692 --> 00:25:21.955
<i>None of you here are special.</i>

398
00:25:22.129 --> 00:25:25.524

<i>the US that you choose.</i>

404
00:25:39.973 --> 00:25:42.105
Hey. what
the fuck does that mean?

405
00:25:42.279 --> 00:25:46.414
What if we say. "Fuck this.
fuck you." and don't do shit?

406
00:25:48.285 --> 00:25:50.418
<i>Well. I should tell you
that each of you</i>

407
00:25:50.592 --> 00:25:53.377
<i>have a nano thermic
explosive in your brain.</i>

408
00:25:53.552 --> 00:25:56.206
<i>It's a tiny explosive.
but remote controlled.</i>

409
00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:57.991
What?

410
00:25:58.165 --> 00:25:59.949
<i>Should you choose
not to participate?</i>

411
00:26:00.123 --> 00:26:02.125
<i>Well. I can end your life.
It's nothing to me.</i>

412
00:26:03.126 --> 00:26:04.780
- Holy shit.
- God.

413
00:26:04.954 --> 00:26:08.175
<i>And finally. I want to express</i>

414
00:26:08.349 --> 00:26:10.612
<i>our gratitude for your service.</i>

415
00:26:10.786 --> 00:26:12.527
<i>Testing on humans has always had</i>

416
00:26:12.701 --> 00:26:14.398
<i>the quickest gains
in medical knowledge.</i>

417
00:26:14.573 --> 00:26:17.967
<i>And for that.
I want to say thank you</i>

418
00:26:18.141 --> 00:26:20.666
<i>for making
the ultimate sacrifice.</i>

419
00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.440
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.
Wait. wait. wait.

420
00:26:22.581 --> 00:26:24.381
What? Ultimate sacrifice.
What does that mean?

421
00:26:25.932 --> 00:26:27.281
<i>Zimieski. please escort them</i>

422
00:26:27.455 --> 00:26:28.978
<i>through the SW tunnel to begin.</i>

423
00:26:29.152 --> 00:26:32.286
<i>Oh. and good luck.</i>

424
00:26:38.684 --> 00:26:41.382
Don't fucking think about it.

425
00:26:58.268 --> 00:26:59.530
Anybody else?

426
00:27:11.064 --> 00:27:12.282
Get up.

427
00:27:15.764 --> 00:27:17.070
Get up against the wall.

428
00:27:18.245 --> 00:27:19.289
Hey. shit head.

429
00:27:20.551 --> 00:27:23.729
Scoot over. Jesus.
You wanna see something?

430
00:27:23.903 --> 00:27:25.818
- What is it?
- My hunt?

431
00:27:25.992 --> 00:27:27.428
No. not really.

432
00:27:27.602 --> 00:27:28.951
Why not?

433
00:27:29.125 --> 00:27:30.823
You know what?
Guess I'm kinda over

434
00:27:30.997 --> 00:27:32.825
watching other people
get the experience.

435
00:27:34.522 --> 00:27:37.568
I hear you.
And trust me. I get it.

436
00:27:37.743 --> 00:27:40.354
I wish that I would've
started off the way you are.

437
00:27:40.528 --> 00:27:43.009
Participation first. kill later.

438
00:27:43.487 --> 00:27:45.185
Death is a motherfucker.

439
00:27:45.402 --> 00:27:46.902
Without the right people.
it'll really fuck you up.

440
00:27:46.926 --> 00:27:48.188
Yeah. I get it.

441
00:27:48.362 --> 00:27:49.600
I'm kind of tired
of the excuses.

442
00:27:49.624 --> 00:27:50.930
Some people wanna kill.

443
00:27:51.104 --> 00:27:52.583
Okay.
And what if they don't?

444
00:27:53.367 --> 00:27:55.064
Really?

445
00:27:55.238 --> 00:27:56.781
No one's ever thought
they'd be good at killing

446
00:27:56.805 --> 00:27:58.217
and actually been right
about themselves?

447
00:27:58.241 --> 00:28:00.461
Jesus H... well.
I mean. here's the deal.

448
00:28:00.635 --> 00:28:02.463
Princess.
you're in a bit of a mood.

449
00:28:02.637 --> 00:28:05.422
So I'm gonna help less and
I'm gonna kick it over here.

450
00:28:05.596 --> 00:28:07.076
But just don't forget

451
00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:08.817
I can whoop
your fucking ass. all right?

452
00:28:08.991 --> 00:28:10.993
Sure. sure. sure.
Just know I can handle it.

453
00:28:11.907 --> 00:28:13.169
Handle what. boy?

454
00:28:13.343 --> 00:28:15.955
Kill. Dad.
I'm fucking ready. man.

455
00:28:16.129 --> 00:28:17.541
You have me
sitting here in the wings.

456
00:28:17.565 --> 00:28:19.219
I mean. how are
we supposed to know

457
00:28:19.393 --> 00:28:21.284
if it's preventative treatment
if we don't test it out?

458
00:28:21.308 --> 00:28:22.938
I know corporate's on your ass
but I'm fucking sick...

459
00:28:22.962 --> 00:28:24.202
I don't care what AMACORP says.

460
00:28:24.354 --> 00:28:25.834
You'll go
when I say you're ready.

461
00:28:34.538 --> 00:28:36.366
Don't worry about Woodman.

462
00:28:37.759 --> 00:28:40.980
You will go soon.

463
00:28:42.721 --> 00:28:44.244
<i>You have made it</i>

464
00:28:44.418 --> 00:28:46.159
<i>to the final stage
of your treatment.</i>

465
00:28:46.333 --> 00:28:48.988
<i>Now go enjoy yourself
and have a happy hunt.</i>

466
00:28:49.597 --> 00:28:51.164
That's exactly what we do here.

467
00:28:51.904 --> 00:28:52.948
Now. you know.

468
00:28:53.906 --> 00:28:56.299
No more rumors
or whisperings in your command.

469
00:28:56.473 --> 00:28:58.606
This is it.
Soft combat.

470
00:28:59.346 --> 00:29:00.666
It's why there's
so much hardware.

471
00:29:01.565 --> 00:29:04.830
Your support staff
is beyond excellent.

472
00:29:08.311 --> 00:29:11.184
While somewhat controversial.
these methods have been. well.

473
00:29:11.358 --> 00:29:13.577
beyond expectation
in terms of results.

474
00:29:15.492 --> 00:29:17.494
We get our soldiers
back to work.

475
00:29:17.668 --> 00:29:21.498
whether it's
for the country or for us.

476
00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:29.332
That's all well and good but
the real question here is...

477
00:29:30.812 --> 00:29:32.268
are you willing
to do the work necessary

478
00:29:32.292 --> 00:29:33.772
to get back out
where you belong?

479
00:29:36.078 --> 00:29:38.559
Because son.
your... your dossier is...

480
00:29:38.733 --> 00:29:39.952
Excellent.

481
00:29:42.215 --> 00:29:43.346
That it is.

482
00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:48.221
But it's not just about you.

483
00:29:48.395 --> 00:29:50.789
it's about a lot of other
men and women like you.

484
00:29:52.051 --> 00:29:54.662
The data
we retrieve in the field.

485
00:29:54.836 --> 00:29:56.969
it dramatically improves
our entire process.

486
00:29:59.362 --> 00:30:02.148
So if you ever
wanna make a difference.

487
00:30:02.322 --> 00:30:03.845
here's your chance.

488
00:30:04.933 --> 00:30:07.283
- Does it work?
- Yes. it does.

489
00:30:08.545 --> 00:30:10.069
This is something
to be proud of. son.

490
00:30:15.814 --> 00:30:17.946
Talked and thought enough
the last few months.

491
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:21.515
Let's get on with it.

492
00:30:25.127 --> 00:30:28.217
You heard the man.
let's get on with it.

493
00:30:46.366 --> 00:30:48.063
Protocol is as follows.

494
00:30:48.237 --> 00:30:50.239
You'll have exactly 60 minutes

495
00:30:50.413 --> 00:30:52.413
to get a head start
before your team gets their OP.

496
00:30:52.894 --> 00:30:55.288
- Fuck this shit. man.
- Fucking serious?

497
00:30:56.593 --> 00:30:57.638
Let's do this.

498
00:30:57.812 --> 00:30:59.770
- Okay.
- Okay.

499
00:31:04.079 --> 00:31:05.951
How do we survive
something like this?

500
00:31:08.127 --> 00:31:09.167
Just make it to the river.

501
00:31:10.259 --> 00:31:11.410
I'll get you. you piece of shit.

502
00:31:11.434 --> 00:31:13.088
- Stop.
- I swear.

503
00:31:13.262 --> 00:31:15.110
- Stop. Stop. Stop.
- You don't even fucking know.

504
00:31:15.134 --> 00:31:16.894
- I'll come for you. you fuck.
- Please stop.

505
00:31:28.364 --> 00:31:31.541
Please. You...
You don't have to do this.

506
00:31:31.715 --> 00:31:33.326
You can just...
You just let us go.

507
00:31:34.327 --> 00:31:35.458
You better hurry.

508
00:31:47.601 --> 00:31:48.689
Kill the music.

509
00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:51.561
No need.

510
00:31:51.735 --> 00:31:53.912
Up. rest.

511
00:31:54.477 --> 00:31:56.557
Chief. you can settle
in here with your support team.

512
00:31:57.045 --> 00:32:00.309
Gentlemen. ladies.

513
00:32:00.483 --> 00:32:01.702
you all know the drill.

514
00:32:02.529 --> 00:32:05.184
This man is in the final phases
of his treatment.

515
00:32:05.358 --> 00:32:07.882
which means he needs our help.

516
00:32:08.883 --> 00:32:12.626
So. we're gonna do
everything within our power

517
00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.802
to make sure we get him
back in the saddle.

518
00:32:15.716 --> 00:32:17.022
Is that clear with all of you?

519
00:32:17.196 --> 00:32:18.719
Yes. sir.

520
00:32:18.893 --> 00:32:20.373
I expect it to be done.

521
00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.637
- Good luck.
- Sir.

522
00:32:26.422 --> 00:32:27.510
Welcome.

523
00:32:30.252 --> 00:32:31.471
Make yourself at home.

524
00:32:32.733 --> 00:32:34.039
We're still a little ways out

525
00:32:34.213 --> 00:32:35.493
so you help yourself
to anything.

526
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:37.433
Thank you.

527
00:32:39.044 --> 00:32:41.785
Welcome. brother.
Good to have you.

528
00:32:42.699 --> 00:32:44.223
You boys kissing?

529
00:32:44.397 --> 00:32:46.094
You'd like that. wouldn't you?

530
00:32:46.268 --> 00:32:49.141
I would actually.
Um. don't listen to Price.

531
00:32:49.315 --> 00:32:51.230
He will never stop
talking to you.

532
00:32:51.404 --> 00:32:53.493
Oh. I thought
you got off my wit. my charm?

533
00:32:53.667 --> 00:32:56.104
Mm. I thought you'd know by now
when a woman was faking it.

534
00:32:56.278 --> 00:32:57.714
Damn.
That's cold.

535
00:32:59.151 --> 00:33:01.501
You know I love you Price.

536
00:33:01.675 --> 00:33:03.285
like a brother.

537
00:33:03.459 --> 00:33:05.896
Like a much younger.
slower brother

538
00:33:06.071 --> 00:33:07.768
who needs my help
just to tie his shoes.

539
00:33:07.942 --> 00:33:09.944
Okay.
Let the man settle in.

540
00:33:14.688 --> 00:33:16.690
Chief Woodman.
you can bunk up over there.

541
00:33:41.932 --> 00:33:43.195
Where are we headed?

542
00:33:43.369 --> 00:33:44.544
Straight to the river.

543
00:33:45.197 --> 00:33:46.807
How much time do we even have?

544
00:33:46.981 --> 00:33:48.504
Wait. wait.
He gave me a watch.

545
00:33:48.678 --> 00:33:50.028
Okay. we'll stop and check.

546
00:33:51.855 --> 00:33:52.855
What time you got?

547
00:33:52.987 --> 00:33:54.510
49 minutes left.

548
00:33:54.684 --> 00:33:56.077
No. we need to pick it up.

549
00:33:56.251 --> 00:33:58.123
No. we need to be smart.

550
00:33:58.297 --> 00:34:01.213
She's gonna kill us.
All right? She's moving slow.

551
00:34:01.387 --> 00:34:02.866
She should give me the watch.

552
00:34:03.041 --> 00:34:04.694
I have the best chance
to get out there.

553
00:34:04.868 --> 00:34:06.759
No. we have the best chance
if we stick together.

554
00:34:06.783 --> 00:34:08.674
Yeah. For the last time
I'm not giving you this watch.

555
00:34:08.698 --> 00:34:10.744
You think what you want.
I'm making it to the river.

556
00:34:10.918 --> 00:34:12.638
Look. if you don't have
anything good to say

557
00:34:12.702 --> 00:34:14.487
then just shut up.

558
00:34:14.661 --> 00:34:15.705
What's that?

559
00:34:17.359 --> 00:34:18.839
What?

560
00:34:20.406 --> 00:34:21.885
That.

561
00:34:22.625 --> 00:34:23.800
Oh. my...

562
00:34:24.671 --> 00:34:25.672
Careful.

563
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:28.283
Where are its arms and legs?

564
00:34:28.457 --> 00:34:29.893
What are you doing?

565
00:34:30.068 --> 00:34:31.286
Being of use.

566
00:34:35.595 --> 00:34:36.944
I think we should keep moving.

567
00:34:37.118 --> 00:34:38.511
Yeah.
What the fuck?

568
00:34:42.689 --> 00:34:44.125
Did you find anything?

569
00:34:44.734 --> 00:34:47.085
No.

570
00:34:47.259 --> 00:34:50.000
No. we should. uh. do like
she says and keep moving.

571
00:34:53.352 --> 00:34:54.744
Come on.

572
00:35:06.278 --> 00:35:07.496
Excuse me.

573
00:35:09.498 --> 00:35:11.021
Woodman's looking a little weak.

574
00:35:11.196 --> 00:35:12.762
Especially socially.

575
00:35:12.936 --> 00:35:14.764
You wanna explain that to me

576
00:35:14.938 --> 00:35:17.376
considering he spent so much
time at your research facility?

577
00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:19.073
He did.

578
00:35:19.247 --> 00:35:21.127
But we are talking about
a man who is considered

579
00:35:21.162 --> 00:35:22.487
to have been one
of our deadliest Seals

580
00:35:22.511 --> 00:35:24.034
in the last five years.

581
00:35:24.209 --> 00:35:26.211
So you okay sending him
out there with my men?

582
00:35:26.385 --> 00:35:29.518
Of course.
Colonel. let's be clear.

583
00:35:29.692 --> 00:35:31.781
Nothing we do
will ever fully get these men

584
00:35:31.955 --> 00:35:33.566
and women back
to where they once were.

585
00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:36.046
But we can see to it
that they're useful again.

586
00:35:36.221 --> 00:35:39.354
Useful people is
what makes society tick.

587
00:35:41.965 --> 00:35:43.271
Thanks for the education.

588
00:35:46.231 --> 00:35:47.928
If Woodman
doesn't shoot. you do.

589
00:35:48.102 --> 00:35:49.495
Yes. ma'am.

590
00:35:50.322 --> 00:35:53.368
43 minutes left.
Can we stop for a second?

591
00:35:53.542 --> 00:35:55.022
No.

592
00:35:55.196 --> 00:35:56.695
It's okay.
You just gotta stay positive.

593
00:35:56.719 --> 00:35:58.330
- Thanks.
- You know.

594
00:36:03.509 --> 00:36:04.901
Hey. hey!

595
00:36:05.075 --> 00:36:06.642
Guys. come quick.

596
00:36:06.816 --> 00:36:08.557
What the fuck?
Give it a minute. man.

597
00:36:09.515 --> 00:36:11.821
I thought
we cleaned up all the traps.

598
00:36:11.995 --> 00:36:13.388
We must have missed one. sir.

599
00:36:14.389 --> 00:36:16.043
It's a waste is what it is.

600
00:36:16.217 --> 00:36:17.784
Waste of a good resource.

601
00:36:17.958 --> 00:36:19.438
It won't happen again. sir.

602
00:36:21.048 --> 00:36:22.223
It better not.

603
00:36:28.534 --> 00:36:29.535
Be careful guys.

604
00:36:31.624 --> 00:36:32.755
Oh. my God.

605
00:36:32.929 --> 00:36:34.453
What the hell is that?

606
00:36:34.627 --> 00:36:37.151
Out here. a wolf trap
or something like that?

607
00:36:37.325 --> 00:36:38.587
How bad is it?

608
00:36:38.761 --> 00:36:40.041
How do you know
it's a wolf trap?

609
00:36:40.198 --> 00:36:41.677
Slowly.

610
00:36:41.851 --> 00:36:43.481
What? You've never seen
a wolf trap before?

611
00:36:43.505 --> 00:36:44.917
We don't have time
for this. we gotta go.

612
00:36:44.941 --> 00:36:47.988
Fuck you. Lance.
No seriously. Fuck you.

613
00:36:48.597 --> 00:36:50.991
- How do I get this thing off?
- Usually. that is uncinched.

614
00:36:51.165 --> 00:36:54.037
Let me try.

615
00:36:55.952 --> 00:36:57.780
- Please. It hurts.
- God. it's not moving.

616
00:36:58.607 --> 00:37:00.130
Stop whining.

617
00:37:00.305 --> 00:37:02.611
Either I'm not
strong enough or it's stuck.

618
00:37:04.222 --> 00:37:07.486
Fine. Fine. I'll fucking help
if it gets her out quicker.

619
00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:08.922
Hey.
You got it.

620
00:37:09.096 --> 00:37:10.619
All right. you ready?

621
00:37:13.143 --> 00:37:14.928
One. two. three.

622
00:37:15.102 --> 00:37:16.103
Pull.

623
00:37:16.277 --> 00:37:17.800
It's not moving.

624
00:37:17.974 --> 00:37:19.280
Pull harder motherfucker.

625
00:37:21.326 --> 00:37:23.023
It's not.

626
00:37:23.197 --> 00:37:24.546
Fuck!

627
00:37:25.721 --> 00:37:27.241
Uh. maybe we can
cut it with something.

628
00:37:27.375 --> 00:37:28.681
- Yeah.
- With what?

629
00:37:28.855 --> 00:37:30.248
Uh. let's see. Uh.

630
00:37:31.161 --> 00:37:32.617
The chain goes
all the way around the log

631
00:37:32.641 --> 00:37:34.121
there's no way
we're gonna move it.

632
00:37:34.295 --> 00:37:36.297
Or we could break it
with something somehow.

633
00:37:36.471 --> 00:37:38.952
Yeah. yeah. yeah.
Uh. a rock or anything sharp.

634
00:37:39.126 --> 00:37:40.736
- Oh. my God.
- Here. here. here.

635
00:37:41.302 --> 00:37:43.565
Oh. okay. okay. here.

636
00:37:47.439 --> 00:37:48.918
The shit's not working.

637
00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:51.530
Time?

638
00:37:51.704 --> 00:37:52.984
I don't know. she has the watch.

639
00:37:58.363 --> 00:38:01.148
Can we have it?
Just in case?

640
00:38:01.322 --> 00:38:03.106
Wait.

641
00:38:15.249 --> 00:38:16.598
Okay.

642
00:38:21.995 --> 00:38:23.301
Thirty-eight minutes.

643
00:38:23.475 --> 00:38:25.085
Which just means
we gotta be faster.

644
00:38:25.259 --> 00:38:27.179
No. it means we're
literally running out of time.

645
00:38:27.261 --> 00:38:29.045
We can't sit here
and play MacGyver forever.

646
00:38:29.219 --> 00:38:31.352
Seriously.
what is wrong with you?

647
00:38:31.526 --> 00:38:32.745
Look. we've got about an hour.

648
00:38:32.919 --> 00:38:34.442
We can still do this.

649
00:38:34.616 --> 00:38:36.202
I would want you to do
the same if it were me.

650
00:38:36.226 --> 00:38:38.054
I'm just being realistic.

651
00:38:38.228 --> 00:38:40.468
Oh. really? So you'd want us to
just leave you here for dead?

652
00:38:40.492 --> 00:38:41.971
Abso-fucking-lutely.

653
00:38:42.145 --> 00:38:43.799
You are a real
piece of work. man.

654
00:38:43.973 --> 00:38:45.853
I'm not dying for
some stranger. I... I'm sorry.

655
00:38:45.932 --> 00:38:47.847
Oh. but you can kill
one with your car?

656
00:38:48.674 --> 00:38:50.676
Fucking know
what you're talking about.

657
00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:52.634
Stop!

658
00:38:52.808 --> 00:38:54.593
- You don't fucking know.
- Stop.

659
00:38:54.767 --> 00:38:56.334
It's not helping
at all. Okay?

660
00:38:56.508 --> 00:38:58.684
Hey. hey. hey.
What's that?

661
00:39:05.821 --> 00:39:08.650
Look. put pressure right here.

662
00:39:08.824 --> 00:39:10.304
Quit the shit.

663
00:39:12.611 --> 00:39:13.916
A hunting vehicle.

664
00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:15.222
This shit is not gonna run.

665
00:39:15.396 --> 00:39:16.789
- Glove box.
- Right?

666
00:39:16.963 --> 00:39:18.323
Maybe there's something
we can use.

667
00:39:36.809 --> 00:39:38.288
Woodman takes out the band.

668
00:39:38.463 --> 00:39:40.726
it's with our support
and support only.

669
00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:46.732
Stay loose and have some fun.

670
00:39:48.211 --> 00:39:49.343
All right?

671
00:39:51.127 --> 00:39:52.651
Let's have a go.

672
00:40:16.326 --> 00:40:20.940
Fuck. Fuck.
Where's the fucking gun?

673
00:40:24.987 --> 00:40:26.859
I found something.

674
00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:30.689
- Jesus.
- Fuck!

675
00:40:30.863 --> 00:40:32.081
Sorry.

676
00:40:38.523 --> 00:40:40.046
This is stupid. but...

677
00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:41.264
What?

678
00:40:42.657 --> 00:40:44.398
I didn't do anything
that I wanted to do.

679
00:40:45.704 --> 00:40:46.792
What do you mean?

680
00:40:49.882 --> 00:40:51.274
I just...

681
00:40:52.754 --> 00:40:55.496
I was just too stupid.

682
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:57.367
I don't know. I was selfish.

683
00:40:57.542 --> 00:40:58.867
- Please don't talk like that.
- I'm gonna die here...

684
00:40:58.891 --> 00:41:00.240
Don't talk like that.

685
00:41:00.414 --> 00:41:02.024
I'm so sorry.
I did it all wrong.

686
00:41:02.198 --> 00:41:03.558
Don't be sorry.
Okay. Don't. Don't.

687
00:41:03.722 --> 00:41:05.162
- I did it all wrong.
- I promise you

688
00:41:05.288 --> 00:41:06.614
that we are gonna
get you out of here.

689
00:41:06.638 --> 00:41:07.943
It's okay.

690
00:41:09.945 --> 00:41:10.990
I'm sorry.

691
00:41:11.599 --> 00:41:14.602
Please. no.
Stay awake.

692
00:41:15.342 --> 00:41:17.779
Stay awake.
Rachel. just breathe.

693
00:41:17.953 --> 00:41:19.793
Okay. Just breathe.
We're gonna get outta here.

694
00:41:19.868 --> 00:41:20.956
We're gonna get outta here.

695
00:41:21.957 --> 00:41:25.874
Yeah. Hey. this looks like
the area we're in right now.

696
00:41:26.527 --> 00:41:27.963
- Right?
- Wait. Hold... hold on.

697
00:41:28.137 --> 00:41:29.697
We don't even know
if that shit is real.

698
00:41:29.965 --> 00:41:31.045
What are you talking about?

699
00:41:31.097 --> 00:41:32.794
Well. the map.

700
00:41:32.968 --> 00:41:34.380
I mean. it's a perfect
fucking map placed here for us.

701
00:41:34.404 --> 00:41:36.058
- We don't know.
- Come on.

702
00:41:36.232 --> 00:41:37.906
You can't be serious.
I mean. look at this thing.

703
00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:39.211
Looks like hasn't been
touched in forever.

704
00:41:39.235 --> 00:41:40.933
They probably forgot about it.

705
00:41:41.107 --> 00:41:42.824
And who gives a fuck?
It's the only thing we got.

706
00:41:42.848 --> 00:41:44.850
Feels like you're
working against us. it's crazy.

707
00:41:45.024 --> 00:41:47.156
Who me? You fuck face!
I'm trying to be smart.

708
00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:48.941
Who knows what
they set up for us?

709
00:41:49.115 --> 00:41:50.769
Holy shit.
Hey. hey. Guys.

710
00:41:50.943 --> 00:41:52.858
Holy shit.
This could be the river.

711
00:41:53.032 --> 00:41:55.469
And this looks like a clearing
not too far from here. right?

712
00:41:55.643 --> 00:41:56.818
Between us and the river.

713
00:41:56.992 --> 00:41:58.559
Yeah. Yeah.
I... I say...

714
00:41:58.733 --> 00:42:00.232
I say we go there
and try and find something

715
00:42:00.256 --> 00:42:01.582
to help us
get the hell outta here.

716
00:42:01.606 --> 00:42:02.998
Guys. she passed out.

717
00:42:03.172 --> 00:42:04.826
Shit.

718
00:42:06.001 --> 00:42:07.263
It's not good. guys.

719
00:42:12.486 --> 00:42:14.227
What... what is that?

720
00:42:16.142 --> 00:42:17.622
Kyle. what...
What time do you have?

721
00:42:19.188 --> 00:42:21.190
30 minutes. It might be
a warning or something.

722
00:42:21.364 --> 00:42:22.820
Yeah. unless
that lead was bullshitting

723
00:42:22.844 --> 00:42:24.280
and they're coming right now.

724
00:42:24.454 --> 00:42:25.649
Either way.
we probably shouldn't stay

725
00:42:25.673 --> 00:42:26.674
in one spot too long.

726
00:42:26.848 --> 00:42:28.110
What about helping Rachel?

727
00:42:43.822 --> 00:42:45.214
Eagle one. this is Red Dog one.

728
00:42:45.388 --> 00:42:46.694
Do you copy?

729
00:42:46.868 --> 00:42:48.043
<i>Red Dog. this is Eagle.</i>

730
00:42:48.217 --> 00:42:50.132
<i>We got you loud.</i>

731
00:42:50.306 --> 00:42:52.346
<i>Be advised that designated
call signs are in effect.</i>

732
00:42:52.395 --> 00:42:53.701
Copy Eagle one.

733
00:42:53.875 --> 00:42:55.921
Red Dog. two. three. four. five.

734
00:42:56.095 --> 00:42:57.618
this is Red Dog one. mic check.

735
00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.099
Three here.

736
00:43:00.273 --> 00:43:01.535
Four here.

737
00:43:01.709 --> 00:43:03.319
- Five here.
- Copy that.

738
00:43:03.493 --> 00:43:05.931
Eagle one. Red Dog one. two
and five will branch off

739
00:43:06.105 --> 00:43:09.064
to the southwest and head
down to the clearing. break.

740
00:43:09.238 --> 00:43:12.372
<i>Red Dog three and four will
team up and head southbound</i>

741
00:43:12.546 --> 00:43:14.026
<i>to flank them
as we flush them out.</i>

742
00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.898
<i>Red Dog one out.</i>

743
00:43:17.072 --> 00:43:18.378
<i>Great. Copy.</i>

744
00:43:26.691 --> 00:43:29.607
We already did this. All right?
We obviously have to leave her.

745
00:43:29.781 --> 00:43:31.130
We can't.

746
00:43:31.304 --> 00:43:32.958
If it weren't
for that map and watch.

747
00:43:33.132 --> 00:43:34.612
I wouldn't be standing here.

748
00:43:34.786 --> 00:43:36.614
Her leg is fucked
even if she wakes up.

749
00:43:36.788 --> 00:43:38.180
No. no. no. no.
Okay. Just wait.

750
00:43:38.354 --> 00:43:40.313
- For what?
- I can get her up.

751
00:43:40.487 --> 00:43:44.143
Okay? Come on. Rachel.
Wake up.

752
00:43:44.317 --> 00:43:45.927
Guys. I hate to say
but we have to go.

753
00:43:46.101 --> 00:43:47.320
- No.
- Now!

754
00:43:47.494 --> 00:43:48.843
Time?

755
00:43:49.539 --> 00:43:50.889
23 minutes.

756
00:43:51.846 --> 00:43:55.850
Hey. hey. hey. hey.
You wanna live. right?

757
00:43:56.024 --> 00:43:57.591
- Right?
- Yes.

758
00:43:57.765 --> 00:43:59.288
This is something we have to do.

759
00:43:59.462 --> 00:44:00.812
There is no choice here.

760
00:44:06.426 --> 00:44:08.515
- Okay. fine.
- Thank you. Thank you.

761
00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:31.712
Oh. my God.
The map is real.

762
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:34.367
You know. I don't see anybody.

763
00:44:35.934 --> 00:44:37.239
I can go down there.

764
00:44:37.762 --> 00:44:39.304
Yeah. why don't...
Why don't you give me the map?

765
00:44:39.328 --> 00:44:40.808
I'll check out over here.

766
00:44:40.982 --> 00:44:42.307
No. fuck that.
We'll never see you again.

767
00:44:42.331 --> 00:44:44.116
Are you sure?

768
00:44:44.290 --> 00:44:46.771
Yeah. I can go down there
and I'll... I'll scope it out

769
00:44:46.945 --> 00:44:48.076
and I'll wave you guys down.

770
00:44:49.077 --> 00:44:50.339
All right. you better hurry

771
00:44:50.513 --> 00:44:51.873
'cause we only got
13 minutes left.

772
00:45:19.325 --> 00:45:20.369
What's your deal?

773
00:45:21.196 --> 00:45:23.416
You're not
your usual jackass self today.

774
00:45:24.373 --> 00:45:26.071
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

775
00:45:26.245 --> 00:45:27.855
I heard you talking to Rawlings.

776
00:45:29.248 --> 00:45:31.076
You know that mission
at the ISO prison

777
00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:32.512
with the CIA dude?

778
00:45:33.165 --> 00:45:35.297
The one where one of ours
killed over 200 of theirs?

779
00:45:35.907 --> 00:45:37.430
Yeah. of course.

780
00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:39.388
Well.

781
00:45:43.044 --> 00:45:44.089
Woodman?

782
00:45:46.526 --> 00:45:47.788
- Oh.
- Yeah.

783
00:45:50.748 --> 00:45:52.706
Okay.

784
00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:54.249
All right.
I say we look for anything

785
00:45:54.273 --> 00:45:55.753
we can use to defend ourselves.

786
00:45:55.927 --> 00:45:57.537
I bet we could find
something that would

787
00:45:57.711 --> 00:45:59.341
- cut that chain on Rachel.
- No. she's dead. Sara!

788
00:45:59.365 --> 00:46:01.280
She's dead!
And we are too if we go back.

789
00:46:02.803 --> 00:46:05.240
Yeah.
We... weapons. Yeah. Okay.

790
00:46:05.414 --> 00:46:07.677
Uh. uh. I'll check
that big stuff over there.

791
00:46:07.852 --> 00:46:09.114
Okay. Yeah. Okay.

792
00:46:09.288 --> 00:46:10.568
Let's split up.
I'll go with you.

793
00:46:11.333 --> 00:46:12.813
Fine. We'll look over here.

794
00:46:20.995 --> 00:46:22.214
Check around the corner.

795
00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:23.974
That's one
of the most savage things

796
00:46:23.998 --> 00:46:24.999
I've ever heard of.

797
00:46:25.957 --> 00:46:27.523
I know.

798
00:46:29.047 --> 00:46:31.167
So. you afraid that there's
gonna be a bigger swinging

799
00:46:31.266 --> 00:46:32.441
dick around here?

800
00:46:32.615 --> 00:46:34.139
- Ha-ha.
- Mm-hmm.

801
00:46:34.313 --> 00:46:36.271
My dick is just
perfectly average. so fuck you.

802
00:46:36.445 --> 00:46:37.707
I'm just saying.

803
00:46:38.099 --> 00:46:39.535
Well. I'm saying there's some

804
00:46:39.753 --> 00:46:41.600
pretty fucked up details
said about that mission.

805
00:46:41.624 --> 00:46:43.191
- So?
- So?

806
00:46:43.975 --> 00:46:45.977
Stupid. my point being
that he wasn't actually

807
00:46:46.151 --> 00:46:47.282
too wounded to be moved.

808
00:46:47.979 --> 00:46:49.328
That woman executed him.

809
00:46:50.503 --> 00:46:52.592
See. that doesn't make
any fucking sense.

810
00:46:52.766 --> 00:46:55.029
because why would you
go through all of that effort

811
00:46:55.203 --> 00:46:56.248
just to kill the guy?

812
00:46:56.857 --> 00:46:58.119
That's what I'm saying.

813
00:46:58.816 --> 00:47:00.936
What if you weren't through
all that just to kill him?

814
00:47:04.343 --> 00:47:05.518
Fuck!

815
00:47:05.692 --> 00:47:08.564
Fuck! Fuck!

816
00:47:08.738 --> 00:47:12.133
I had to. I had to.
I had to. I had to.

817
00:47:12.917 --> 00:47:14.788
Even if it was
for a good reason.

818
00:47:14.962 --> 00:47:17.182
kill your own guy like that.
it had to fuck you up.

819
00:47:18.705 --> 00:47:20.750
He was in pretreatment
longer than us.

820
00:47:20.925 --> 00:47:22.448
Yeah. I know.
Like three months.

821
00:47:22.622 --> 00:47:23.686
What the fuck
were they doing with the guy?

822
00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:24.798
That place is hell.

823
00:47:26.234 --> 00:47:28.034
I don't know. I mean.
look what it did for us.

824
00:47:28.976 --> 00:47:30.499
I've got
almost a year sober now.

825
00:47:31.152 --> 00:47:32.371
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

826
00:47:32.545 --> 00:47:34.025
You're fucking nuts.

827
00:47:34.199 --> 00:47:35.809
Chris. Chris.

828
00:47:35.983 --> 00:47:37.898
Oh. fuck.
he fucking killed me that...

829
00:47:39.073 --> 00:47:42.207
Kyle. Kyle.
Kyle come here.

830
00:47:42.381 --> 00:47:43.948
- Please help me.
- I can't stand up.

831
00:47:44.122 --> 00:47:45.558
- I can't stand up.
- Kyle!

832
00:47:49.127 --> 00:47:52.217
Kyle and Lance just both left.
Oh. my God. Oh. my God.

833
00:47:52.391 --> 00:47:54.219
Oh God.

834
00:47:54.393 --> 00:47:55.742
Another one?

835
00:48:00.355 --> 00:48:02.096
You're slipping. Colonel.

836
00:48:02.967 --> 00:48:04.055
Show me.

837
00:48:05.056 --> 00:48:06.144
I said show me!

838
00:48:14.152 --> 00:48:15.196
Hey.

839
00:48:40.787 --> 00:48:41.875
Lance!

840
00:48:48.099 --> 00:48:49.187
Lance!

841
00:48:50.362 --> 00:48:53.060
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
it wasn't personal. man.

842
00:48:53.234 --> 00:48:55.410
- We gotta stop the bleeding.
- Okay. Okay.

843
00:49:01.677 --> 00:49:05.159
Oh fuck!

844
00:49:05.333 --> 00:49:06.378
Hey. cutie.

845
00:49:08.336 --> 00:49:10.860
Wait. Wait.
Wait. Hold on.

846
00:49:13.733 --> 00:49:15.213
I just wanna go home.

847
00:49:15.387 --> 00:49:16.736
Hey. don't do this.
Don't do this.

848
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:18.216
- Hey. hey.
- I wanna go home.

849
00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:19.670
Let's go back
for Chris and Sara.

850
00:49:19.739 --> 00:49:20.739
No. Do you wanna live?

851
00:49:21.741 --> 00:49:22.916
I wanna live.

852
00:49:27.051 --> 00:49:28.182
Oh. fuck.

853
00:49:34.536 --> 00:49:36.321
We can't have much time left.

854
00:49:37.931 --> 00:49:40.107
You know that motherfucker
took the watch.

855
00:49:40.281 --> 00:49:41.717
Okay.

856
00:49:41.891 --> 00:49:44.155
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go find anything

857
00:49:44.329 --> 00:49:45.609
that can help you
get outta here.

858
00:49:45.634 --> 00:49:46.809
All right?

859
00:49:47.375 --> 00:49:49.135
I didn't do anything.
Please. please. please.

860
00:49:49.203 --> 00:49:51.162
I didn't do anything.
You can take me away. okay?

861
00:49:51.336 --> 00:49:53.425
Red Dog one
this is Red Dog four.

862
00:49:53.599 --> 00:49:54.992
We got a live one. over.

863
00:49:55.166 --> 00:49:56.906
<i>Copy Red Dog four.</i>

864
00:49:57.081 --> 00:49:58.386
<i>How alive are we talking?</i>

865
00:49:59.997 --> 00:50:01.433
Red one this is Red four.

866
00:50:03.043 --> 00:50:04.610
She's got
a little kick in her left.

867
00:50:10.616 --> 00:50:12.096
Yeah. I wanna go home.

868
00:50:15.795 --> 00:50:18.493
- No. I am not leaving you here.
- Sara. Sara.

869
00:50:18.667 --> 00:50:19.755
Chris.

870
00:50:20.843 --> 00:50:22.643
What do you think
is gonna happen out there...

871
00:50:23.759 --> 00:50:25.152
realistically?

872
00:50:25.326 --> 00:50:28.199
No. no. no.
I am not leaving you.

873
00:50:28.373 --> 00:50:31.332
- Sara.
- I'm not. no. Chris.

874
00:50:31.506 --> 00:50:33.334
The best thing you can do is go.

875
00:50:33.508 --> 00:50:37.034
Lance. don't do that.

876
00:50:37.208 --> 00:50:40.559
Come on man.
Look. this is the river.

877
00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:44.345
You wanna go home?

878
00:50:50.003 --> 00:50:52.353
Shit! They are coming.

879
00:50:52.527 --> 00:50:53.615
Just fucking go.

880
00:50:54.399 --> 00:50:56.879
- Just fucking go.
- I'm sorry.

881
00:50:57.967 --> 00:51:01.014
I dunno how useful she'll be
for the program. over.

882
00:51:01.188 --> 00:51:02.972
I don't wanna die.
Please guys. please.

883
00:51:03.147 --> 00:51:04.800
<i>Woodman is priority one.</i>

884
00:51:04.974 --> 00:51:06.774
<i>Grab that target
move on to rally point Bravo.</i>

885
00:51:07.194 --> 00:51:08.369
Copy that.

886
00:51:08.543 --> 00:51:10.589
- Wait. wait. no. wait.
- Ah?

887
00:51:10.763 --> 00:51:12.323
Please. hey. no.
no. no. no. no. no. no.

888
00:51:22.644 --> 00:51:23.776
No. please. Please. Please.

889
00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:25.430
Hey. no. no. no. no. no.

890
00:51:25.604 --> 00:51:28.302
- No. no. come on.
- Lively one today.

891
00:51:28.476 --> 00:51:30.454
We're gonna work better
if we put our heads together.

892
00:51:30.478 --> 00:51:32.358
Let's just come up
with a different plan. Lance.

893
00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:35.309
You're crazy.

894
00:51:38.878 --> 00:51:40.706
Please. please. No. No. No!

895
00:51:43.361 --> 00:51:44.623
Whoo!

896
00:52:21.138 --> 00:52:23.444
<i>Remember. if Woodman
doesn't kill. you do.</i>

897
00:52:25.316 --> 00:52:26.621
I found one. I found one.

898
00:52:35.543 --> 00:52:36.849
Shitheels
must have deserted him.

899
00:52:40.505 --> 00:52:41.897
That what happen. boy?

900
00:52:42.071 --> 00:52:43.071
They leave ya?

901
00:52:43.203 --> 00:52:44.291
Fuck.

902
00:52:45.466 --> 00:52:47.076
Someone severed
your Achilles tendon.

903
00:52:48.469 --> 00:52:49.514
That's no fun.

904
00:52:56.521 --> 00:52:57.961
It's your show.
what do you wanna do?

905
00:53:00.829 --> 00:53:02.396
Hey. Junior.
can you give us a moment?

906
00:53:06.139 --> 00:53:07.184
You okay?

907
00:53:10.883 --> 00:53:12.711
<i>Blue Jay one. sitrep. over.</i>

908
00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:18.238
I just need
a private moment with him.

909
00:53:18.412 --> 00:53:20.109
Please. please. please.

910
00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:22.024
Attaboy.

911
00:53:28.030 --> 00:53:30.207
Please. don't.
Please. don't. Please. don't.

912
00:53:38.302 --> 00:53:40.260
Please. please.
You don't have to do it.

913
00:53:40.434 --> 00:53:42.219
Please let me go.
Please. please.

914
00:53:42.915 --> 00:53:44.395
Don't. Stop.

915
00:53:48.312 --> 00:53:49.487
Yes.

916
00:53:52.446 --> 00:53:53.926
Please.

917
00:53:59.801 --> 00:54:00.889
Stop!

918
00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:23.564
Excellent.

919
00:54:27.786 --> 00:54:28.830
Good work. soldier.

920
00:55:13.397 --> 00:55:14.920
<i>Red one. it's Red three.</i>

921
00:55:15.964 --> 00:55:17.270
<i>It's done. over.</i>

922
00:55:19.968 --> 00:55:21.056
Copy that.

923
00:55:23.363 --> 00:55:24.408
Come on.

924
00:55:28.063 --> 00:55:30.065
We'll push him back down
towards Price and Lipson.

925
00:55:30.762 --> 00:55:32.111
There you can
continue your work.

926
00:55:49.041 --> 00:55:50.347
Sara. Sara.

927
00:55:51.173 --> 00:55:53.175
Get off me.
What the hell? Get off me.

928
00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:54.786
- Get off me.
- Stop!

929
00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:55.787
- I'm saving you right now.
- Get off me!

930
00:55:55.961 --> 00:55:57.179
Why did you leave?

931
00:55:58.093 --> 00:56:01.140
Why didn't you come back?
Did you know that Chris died?

932
00:56:01.923 --> 00:56:03.011
Why?

933
00:56:04.535 --> 00:56:05.927
- Why?
- I came down here

934
00:56:06.101 --> 00:56:07.842
because Lance
took the map. okay?

935
00:56:08.016 --> 00:56:10.018
I was not leaving you.
I was coming back for you.

936
00:56:13.239 --> 00:56:16.329
And when I got down here.
I saw that.

937
00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:23.292
Oh. my God.

938
00:56:23.467 --> 00:56:25.556
- What happened to his...
- I don't know.

939
00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:27.253
My best guess
is that that charge

940
00:56:27.427 --> 00:56:29.298
detonated as soon
as he crossed the river.

941
00:56:31.518 --> 00:56:33.215
Must be some sort of fail-safe.

942
00:56:36.088 --> 00:56:37.648
They were
never gonna let us outta here.

943
00:56:39.744 --> 00:56:41.136
At least not across the river.

944
00:56:43.530 --> 00:56:44.575
So. what now?

945
00:56:46.403 --> 00:56:49.101
We stick together
and we survive.

946
00:57:08.076 --> 00:57:09.164
All right.

947
00:57:09.948 --> 00:57:11.906
Remember. we're here
to support Woodman.

948
00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:14.256
So let's try to make
the best of what we have left.

949
00:57:14.735 --> 00:57:16.615
Lipson. we're gonna need
your pathfinder skills.

950
00:57:16.694 --> 00:57:18.217
Try and track 'em
along the river.

951
00:57:18.391 --> 00:57:20.064
see if they diverted somewhere.
take Woodman.

952
00:57:20.088 --> 00:57:21.588
Price and I will
head to the high ground

953
00:57:21.612 --> 00:57:23.048
try to flush 'em down to you.

954
00:57:24.745 --> 00:57:25.833
Junior. go with Lipson.

955
00:57:27.008 --> 00:57:28.096
All right. let's move out.

956
00:57:33.624 --> 00:57:35.464
You sure we can fix
what's wrong with this guy?

957
00:57:36.496 --> 00:57:39.325
What did I tell you?
Don't worry about Woodman.

958
00:57:40.892 --> 00:57:42.023
Keep your head in the game.

959
00:57:51.859 --> 00:57:54.296
Hey. how long do you think
until we get to that mountain?

960
00:57:55.036 --> 00:57:56.821
I don't know.
about two trail miles

961
00:57:56.995 --> 00:57:59.040
before we clear the forest
and hit some foothills.

962
00:57:59.693 --> 00:58:01.521
Meaning?

963
00:58:01.695 --> 00:58:03.958
Sorry. uh. three more miles
till we reach higher ground.

964
00:58:06.395 --> 00:58:08.355
Do you think we could
get to the other side of it?

965
00:58:09.442 --> 00:58:10.835
Maybe there's
a town or something.

966
00:58:12.097 --> 00:58:14.578
I don't know.
But we gotta try. right?

967
00:58:16.231 --> 00:58:17.319
Right.

968
00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:20.105
Come on.

969
00:58:40.081 --> 00:58:41.641
Is all that shit
they said you did true?

970
00:58:42.431 --> 00:58:44.521
Depends what was said.

971
00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:47.045
Bet it was hard
to kill one of your own guys.

972
00:58:47.698 --> 00:58:49.134
Yeah. I could do it if I had to.

973
00:58:49.308 --> 00:58:50.352
You weren't there.

974
00:58:50.962 --> 00:58:52.311
Don't believe
everything you hear.

975
00:58:52.485 --> 00:58:54.226
- What happened?
- That's enough.

976
00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:56.445
Have some fucking respect.

977
00:58:56.924 --> 00:58:58.970
The trail's fresh here.
so we're about to engage.

978
00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:03.322
- There she is.
- Stop it.

979
00:59:03.801 --> 00:59:05.237
It's Woodman's shot.

980
00:59:05.411 --> 00:59:06.673
Practicing my aim.

981
00:59:24.038 --> 00:59:25.213
That's a mess.

982
00:59:25.387 --> 00:59:27.215
I prefer close quarters anyways.

983
00:59:27.389 --> 00:59:28.782
Fuck this!

984
00:59:55.766 --> 00:59:57.855
He's killing his own people.

985
00:59:58.507 --> 01:00:00.161
Motherfucker has gone crazy.

986
01:00:03.121 --> 01:00:04.296
Move.

987
01:00:07.516 --> 01:00:09.431
Somebody want to tell me
what the holy fuck

988
01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:10.911
is going on around here?

989
01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.610
Woodman is
going after everyone. sir.

990
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:16.917
My program.

991
01:00:17.091 --> 01:00:18.136
Damn it!

992
01:00:20.007 --> 01:00:21.443
Come in. Woodman. over.

993
01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:23.073
He's removed
his tracking device. sir.

994
01:00:23.097 --> 01:00:24.577
Obviously.

995
01:00:27.536 --> 01:00:28.973
<i>Woodman. come in. over.</i>

996
01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:32.846
<i>Come in. Woodman. over.</i>

997
01:00:35.936 --> 01:00:38.722
<i>Woodman.
Come in. Woodman. over.</i>

998
01:00:46.251 --> 01:00:47.556
The fuck was that?

999
01:00:47.731 --> 01:00:48.949
- What?
- I don't know.

1000
01:00:49.123 --> 01:00:50.690
I don't know.

1001
01:00:50.864 --> 01:00:52.537
He's just...
He... he just... I got back...

1002
01:00:52.561 --> 01:00:54.235
I gotta get outta here.
You don't understand.

1003
01:00:54.259 --> 01:00:55.956
Look. look. look. I know...

1004
01:00:56.130 --> 01:00:58.108
I know it's a lot to take in.
but we gotta stay calm.

1005
01:00:58.132 --> 01:00:59.936
He's going after everybody.
I... I... gotta get outta here.

1006
01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:01.372
I gotta... I gotta get back.
You don't understand.

1007
01:01:01.396 --> 01:01:02.916
- Like. you don't understand.
- I know.

1008
01:01:03.050 --> 01:01:04.419
Kyle. you just gotta...
You gotta breathe.

1009
01:01:04.443 --> 01:01:07.141
Just stop.
Breathe. breathe. okay?

1010
01:01:07.315 --> 01:01:08.752
Okay. Okay. okay.

1011
01:01:09.361 --> 01:01:11.058
Okay? Okay?

1012
01:01:11.232 --> 01:01:12.277
Yeah. Fuck!

1013
01:01:15.759 --> 01:01:16.803
Okay.

1014
01:01:22.417 --> 01:01:24.071
I don't recognize any of this.

1015
01:01:25.159 --> 01:01:26.334
I don't know where we are.

1016
01:01:27.901 --> 01:01:29.141
I don't know.
Lance had the map.

1017
01:01:34.734 --> 01:01:37.389
We should go back to the place
they were holding us in.

1018
01:01:40.392 --> 01:01:42.263
You want to go back
to those psychopaths?

1019
01:01:42.786 --> 01:01:44.265
Yeah. Yeah.

1020
01:01:44.439 --> 01:01:45.808
I mean. it's the only thing
I can think of.

1021
01:01:45.832 --> 01:01:47.138
If they brought us in that way.

1022
01:01:47.312 --> 01:01:48.748
then I bet
we can go out that way.

1023
01:01:51.316 --> 01:01:53.144
That actually
fucking makes sense.

1024
01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:56.380
And we just gotta
figure out how to get there.

1025
01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:04.720
Oh. God.

1026
01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:25.263
You lying down on duty. boy?

1027
01:02:29.789 --> 01:02:31.095
You answer when I talk to you.

1028
01:02:34.185 --> 01:02:35.229
God!

1029
01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:41.801
You're a mess son.

1030
01:02:43.803 --> 01:02:46.023
Look at these zips are undone.

1031
01:02:50.636 --> 01:02:51.724
At ease. son.

1032
01:03:14.355 --> 01:03:15.530
Hey. man.

1033
01:03:16.227 --> 01:03:17.794
Stop! Top. Top.

1034
01:03:17.968 --> 01:03:19.752
Jason! Jason!

1035
01:03:20.709 --> 01:03:21.972
It's me.

1036
01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:28.065
You with me?

1037
01:03:29.631 --> 01:03:30.719
Are you with me?

1038
01:03:36.551 --> 01:03:37.551
Let's go.

1039
01:03:48.215 --> 01:03:49.216
Whose radio was that?

1040
01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:50.696
Price.

1041
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:52.393
- Is he still on?
- Yes. sir.

1042
01:03:53.307 --> 01:03:54.482
Why isn't he saying anything?

1043
01:03:58.443 --> 01:03:59.531
Oh. God.

1044
01:04:01.968 --> 01:04:04.318
Price.
Price come in. over.

1045
01:04:06.494 --> 01:04:07.974
<i>Price.
Come in. Price.</i>

1046
01:04:13.588 --> 01:04:15.808
Sir. Junior and Lipson are dead.

1047
01:04:15.982 --> 01:04:18.115
<i>It's Woodman. He's gone rogue.</i>

1048
01:04:18.289 --> 01:04:19.507
<i>Fall back to command.</i>

1049
01:04:21.596 --> 01:04:23.598
We'll find him.

1050
01:04:23.772 --> 01:04:25.774
<i>Negative. Negative.</i>

1051
01:04:25.949 --> 01:04:28.734
<i>Fall back to command
and wait for QRF.</i>

1052
01:04:30.518 --> 01:04:32.390
I'm sorry sir. but fuck that.

1053
01:04:33.043 --> 01:04:36.176
We got it covered.
We want this one. over and out.

1054
01:04:36.350 --> 01:04:38.265
<i>Negative.</i>

1055
01:04:38.439 --> 01:04:42.095
<i>Rawlings respond. Rawlings.
the program is at stake.</i>

1056
01:04:59.069 --> 01:05:01.134
I say we split up and we
flush this motherfucker out.

1057
01:05:01.158 --> 01:05:02.202
Yeah.

1058
01:05:07.816 --> 01:05:09.456
We need to get them
outta there right now.

1059
01:05:09.514 --> 01:05:12.212
No. they stay.

1060
01:05:13.344 --> 01:05:14.562
What did you just say to me?

1061
01:05:14.736 --> 01:05:16.129
Those are my men out there.

1062
01:05:16.303 --> 01:05:18.523
My program. my data.
They stay.

1063
01:05:19.611 --> 01:05:21.352
They know
what they signed up for.

1064
01:05:21.526 --> 01:05:24.137
You think because some
politician owes you a favor

1065
01:05:24.311 --> 01:05:26.009
that you know
what's coming our direction?

1066
01:05:26.183 --> 01:05:28.489
Because you don't.
You need to think again.

1067
01:05:28.663 --> 01:05:30.361
Colonel...

1068
01:05:30.535 --> 01:05:32.415
If the military wasn't
such a little boys' club.

1069
01:05:32.493 --> 01:05:34.800
I doubt you would've ever been
let in in the first place.

1070
01:05:36.149 --> 01:05:37.324
So. get back to work.

1071
01:05:52.122 --> 01:05:53.601
I don't know where we are.

1072
01:05:53.775 --> 01:05:55.342
I don't know
how I got so turned around.

1073
01:05:55.516 --> 01:05:56.996
This is not working.

1074
01:05:57.170 --> 01:05:58.713
It's okay.
Don't be so hard on yourself.

1075
01:05:58.737 --> 01:06:00.913
- We'll get there.
- This is hopeless. Sara.

1076
01:06:01.087 --> 01:06:02.393
Do you understand that?

1077
01:06:02.567 --> 01:06:04.264
He is gonna find us and kill us.

1078
01:06:04.438 --> 01:06:06.358
No. no. no. no. Stop. okay?
This is not hopeless.

1079
01:06:06.832 --> 01:06:09.008
I didn't come this far to just
give up right now. okay?

1080
01:06:09.182 --> 01:06:10.967
I am getting back to my son.

1081
01:06:12.316 --> 01:06:13.316
You have a son?

1082
01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:23.675
Woodman is still in the area.
sir. he's moving.

1083
01:06:25.111 --> 01:06:27.940
- Get Zimieski in here.
- Zimieski. back to base.

1084
01:06:55.185 --> 01:06:57.317
One. You go that way.

1085
01:06:58.405 --> 01:06:59.885
I go the other way.

1086
01:07:11.853 --> 01:07:13.507
No!

1087
01:07:15.335 --> 01:07:16.728
- No!
- Thank you.

1088
01:07:49.239 --> 01:07:50.457
This won't erase what you did.

1089
01:09:06.185 --> 01:09:07.447
Eyes on Gravedigger.

1090
01:09:09.449 --> 01:09:12.757
Stop. Stop.
I'm not going anywhere.

1091
01:09:12.931 --> 01:09:14.324
It's time
to get you home. cowboy.

1092
01:09:14.498 --> 01:09:15.803
- Let's do this.
- Stop!

1093
01:09:15.977 --> 01:09:17.718
I am set to blow.

1094
01:09:19.285 --> 01:09:20.895
You need to
get your boys outta here.

1095
01:09:21.069 --> 01:09:22.332
I'm not leaving you.

1096
01:09:22.506 --> 01:09:24.203
Listen. you fucking moron.

1097
01:09:24.377 --> 01:09:27.946
If you try to move me.
you and your boys are dead.

1098
01:09:30.644 --> 01:09:32.385
Look. we don't have time.

1099
01:09:34.344 --> 01:09:35.910
I need you to finish me.

1100
01:09:36.084 --> 01:09:37.738
I'm not doing that.

1101
01:09:37.912 --> 01:09:40.828
I'm not asking you.
I'm telling you I am fucked.

1102
01:09:42.569 --> 01:09:44.310
They've cut me in places.

1103
01:09:45.572 --> 01:09:47.661
I can't even feel my legs.

1104
01:09:50.577 --> 01:09:53.537
I need you to finish me.

1105
01:09:55.887 --> 01:09:58.411
They don't win. I win.

1106
01:10:03.199 --> 01:10:05.592
Are you a killer? Huh?

1107
01:10:05.766 --> 01:10:07.942
Then do your goddamn job.

1108
01:10:10.902 --> 01:10:12.686
No. we're not out yet.

1109
01:10:16.168 --> 01:10:17.213
Look at me.

1110
01:10:18.910 --> 01:10:20.172
It's okay.

1111
01:10:25.177 --> 01:10:26.222
That's it.

1112
01:10:27.223 --> 01:10:28.659
That's my boy.

1113
01:10:30.791 --> 01:10:33.881
Thank you. son. Thank you.

1114
01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:55.575
Sir.
inclement weather approaching.

1115
01:10:55.599 --> 01:10:56.991
Possible rainfall.

1116
01:10:57.165 --> 01:11:00.604
Rawlings. fall back. over.

1117
01:11:00.778 --> 01:11:03.259
<i>Fall back.
Rawlings. fall back. over.</i>

1118
01:11:24.062 --> 01:11:26.499
What the fuck is wrong
with Rawlings' equipment?

1119
01:11:26.673 --> 01:11:28.849
It seems fine. It's stationary.
It must have come off.

1120
01:11:29.023 --> 01:11:30.023
Fuck!

1121
01:11:56.050 --> 01:11:58.096
Fuck you. Fuck AMACORP.

1122
01:11:58.270 --> 01:12:00.577
You and your psycho
babble bullshit.

1123
01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:03.275
The program was just mine
before you showed up.

1124
01:12:03.449 --> 01:12:04.769
We could have saved
so many lives.

1125
01:12:06.496 --> 01:12:09.934
This blood is on your hands.
not mine.

1126
01:12:36.177 --> 01:12:37.527
- Abort the mission.
- No.

1127
01:12:37.701 --> 01:12:38.789
Stay on task.

1128
01:12:40.617 --> 01:12:41.661
Did I stutter?

1129
01:12:42.923 --> 01:12:44.925
Abort the goddamn mission.

1130
01:12:47.275 --> 01:12:48.973
Hey!

1131
01:12:51.541 --> 01:12:54.370
We have not finished yet.

1132
01:13:17.610 --> 01:13:19.046
You're out.

1133
01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:20.352
I know.

1134
01:13:26.097 --> 01:13:27.228
Yeah. me too.

1135
01:13:35.323 --> 01:13:36.412
You bitch!

1136
01:13:37.630 --> 01:13:39.327
You shot me.

1137
01:13:41.199 --> 01:13:42.635
You're a coward.

1138
01:13:46.117 --> 01:13:47.684
If you're gonna shoot a man...

1139
01:13:48.859 --> 01:13:51.078
you shoot him face to face.

1140
01:13:54.168 --> 01:13:56.954
Like I said.
we're not finished yet.

1141
01:14:51.922 --> 01:14:53.053
He was my son.

1142
01:16:35.242 --> 01:16:37.201
<i>Clear everything.</i>

1143
01:16:37.375 --> 01:16:39.377
<i>Clear it all. You. with me?</i>

1144
01:16:39.551 --> 01:16:40.639
Hurry up.

1145
01:16:41.292 --> 01:16:42.467
How much time?

1146
01:16:42.641 --> 01:16:43.860
It's almost done. ma'am.

1147
01:16:47.037 --> 01:16:48.429
QRF in 45 mikes.

1148
01:16:49.213 --> 01:16:50.562
What is it?

1149
01:17:37.696 --> 01:17:38.741
Sara?

1150
01:17:40.481 --> 01:17:43.571
You... you left me again.

1151
01:17:43.746 --> 01:17:45.878
I'm sorry. I freaked out.

1152
01:17:46.052 --> 01:17:48.968
I thought they got you.
But you made it. You're here.

1153
01:17:49.142 --> 01:17:50.796
Get away from me.
Get away from me.

1154
01:17:50.970 --> 01:17:52.450
No. no. no. no.
We need each other.

1155
01:17:52.624 --> 01:17:53.886
Woodman is still out there.

1156
01:17:56.497 --> 01:17:58.017
- Who are you talking about?
- The guy.

1157
01:17:58.108 --> 01:17:59.979
The guy who was
killing everybody.

1158
01:18:00.153 --> 01:18:02.434
I heard somebody say his name
when he was in here earlier.

1159
01:18:06.594 --> 01:18:09.336
Look. I'm really sorry. okay?

1160
01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:11.295
I am a coward. A piece of shit.

1161
01:18:11.469 --> 01:18:14.124
There is no denying that.
We need to get out of here.

1162
01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:23.655
Whoa!

1163
01:18:23.829 --> 01:18:26.049
Look. I can explain.
I can explain.

1164
01:18:26.223 --> 01:18:27.615
Explain what?

1165
01:18:27.790 --> 01:18:29.269
I was just
doing my duty. all right?

1166
01:18:29.443 --> 01:18:31.184
I was ordered.

1167
01:18:31.358 --> 01:18:33.249
You don't understand.
It's a program to help vets.

1168
01:18:33.273 --> 01:18:34.448
It is a good thing.

1169
01:18:34.622 --> 01:18:35.841
You were with them...

1170
01:18:37.190 --> 01:18:38.409
the whole time?

1171
01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:42.326
I was just doing my job.

1172
01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:43.893
Sara. look at me.

1173
01:18:44.067 --> 01:18:45.764
Look at me. Sara.

1174
01:18:45.938 --> 01:18:48.419
Sara. look at me. Look.

1175
01:18:50.551 --> 01:18:52.031
No.

1176
01:18:52.205 --> 01:18:53.805
Don't do it. please.
Don't do it. please.

1177
01:18:54.686 --> 01:18:56.296
My job is to be the fail-safe.

1178
01:18:57.558 --> 01:18:59.647
Make sure you stay
on the hunting grounds.

1179
01:19:02.041 --> 01:19:05.044
Make sure these veterans
get the help that they need.

1180
01:19:05.218 --> 01:19:06.742
Please don't do this.
Please.

1181
01:19:09.483 --> 01:19:10.963
The program helps.

1182
01:19:12.182 --> 01:19:14.271
Why couldn't you just
die like the rest of them?

1183
01:20:10.196 --> 01:20:11.284
Sara.

1184
01:20:12.155 --> 01:20:14.026
Sara. come on.

1185
01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:16.420
Sara. Sara. Sara.

1186
01:20:18.639 --> 01:20:20.095
Hey. hey. hey. It's okay.
It's okay. You're fine.

1187
01:20:20.119 --> 01:20:21.251
You're fine. It's okay.

1188
01:20:21.773 --> 01:20:24.471
Chris. I heard you dying.

1189
01:20:24.645 --> 01:20:26.125
- I know.
- No. no. no.

1190
01:20:26.299 --> 01:20:28.258
- I heard you dying.
- I know. I know.

1191
01:20:28.432 --> 01:20:29.737
What happened?

1192
01:20:30.564 --> 01:20:31.609
He saved my life.

1193
01:20:33.306 --> 01:20:34.438
Who?

1194
01:20:35.526 --> 01:20:36.614
Him.

1195
01:20:38.485 --> 01:20:40.618
- Woodman.
- No. no. no. no. no. no.

1196
01:20:40.792 --> 01:20:42.663
He's the only reason
why I'm still alive.

1197
01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:43.926
No. no. your face.

1198
01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:45.492
He's not a good man.

1199
01:20:45.666 --> 01:20:47.146
He had to make it
look real or else

1200
01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:48.515
he would've
had to really kill me.

1201
01:20:48.539 --> 01:20:50.019
I don't believe you.

1202
01:20:50.193 --> 01:20:51.629
That piece of shit.
he hunted us.

1203
01:20:51.803 --> 01:20:53.152
He hunted us.

1204
01:20:53.326 --> 01:20:55.111
He had to make it seem that way.

1205
01:20:55.285 --> 01:20:57.461
He's here to shut
down the program. okay?

1206
01:20:57.635 --> 01:20:59.115
- What?
- Yeah.

1207
01:20:59.811 --> 01:21:01.073
What?

1208
01:21:02.422 --> 01:21:04.250
Okay. what is this
program exactly?

1209
01:21:08.864 --> 01:21:10.953
This program is meant
to get us back to killing.

1210
01:21:12.084 --> 01:21:13.694
Plain and simple.

1211
01:21:13.869 --> 01:21:15.871
Military can't lose
their investments.

1212
01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:18.438
So then. why did you help us?

1213
01:21:21.311 --> 01:21:23.182
I did something
I could never take back.

1214
01:21:28.666 --> 01:21:29.666
You remind me of her.

1215
01:21:46.423 --> 01:21:49.556
<i>I must congratulate you. Marcus.</i>

1216
01:21:49.730 --> 01:21:52.690
<i>You are far more dangerous
than even I expected.</i>

1217
01:21:52.864 --> 01:21:54.822
You know. one thing
I learned many years ago

1218
01:21:54.997 --> 01:21:56.955
is there are no accidents.

1219
01:21:57.129 --> 01:21:59.653
It was no accident
that you were selected

1220
01:21:59.827 --> 01:22:01.655
for that mission
all those years ago.

1221
01:22:04.136 --> 01:22:07.574
<i>It was no accident
that my colleague was tortured</i>

1222
01:22:07.748 --> 01:22:09.533
<i>so close to death.</i>

1223
01:22:11.187 --> 01:22:12.840
And it was no accident

1224
01:22:13.015 --> 01:22:16.844
that you were forced
to make an impossible decision.

1225
01:22:17.019 --> 01:22:19.412
<i>I suppose
you saved us all in the end.</i>

1226
01:22:19.586 --> 01:22:21.066
It's okay.

1227
01:22:25.201 --> 01:22:28.117
<i>You see. I never
wanted to cure PTSD.</i>

1228
01:22:28.291 --> 01:22:32.730
I wanted to harness it.
turn it into a weapon.

1229
01:22:32.904 --> 01:22:35.820
<i>That old man
tried to stop my program.</i>

1230
01:22:36.647 --> 01:22:37.691
He had to go.

1231
01:22:38.518 --> 01:22:40.433
And I saw an opportunity.

1232
01:22:42.174 --> 01:22:45.743
<i>Marcus. I have been in your head</i>

1233
01:22:45.917 --> 01:22:48.093
since before
you even you knew my name.

1234
01:22:48.267 --> 01:22:50.400
Breaking you down.

1235
01:22:50.574 --> 01:22:51.792
Mind if hang out over here?

1236
01:22:51.967 --> 01:22:53.098
Clearing the field.

1237
01:22:55.144 --> 01:22:58.756
You were the key to the true
Stalking Fields Program.

1238
01:22:58.930 --> 01:23:01.150
The one I designed.

1239
01:23:01.324 --> 01:23:03.891
And now. thanks to you.
I have everything I need

1240
01:23:04.066 --> 01:23:07.939
to show those bureaucrats
how effective it is.

1241
01:23:08.113 --> 01:23:11.943
<i>Give a man a purpose he'll
turn into a ferocious dog.</i>

1242
01:23:12.117 --> 01:23:14.641
<i>Just like I gave you when...</i>

1243
01:23:14.815 --> 01:23:16.774
<i>When I killed
your wife and child.</i>

1244
01:23:18.428 --> 01:23:20.734
<i>Claver said they died slowly.</i>

1245
01:23:25.696 --> 01:23:26.871
Car trouble?

1246
01:23:35.358 --> 01:23:36.750
I'll drive next time.

1247
01:23:38.883 --> 01:23:42.669
<i>You see. there are no accidents.</i>

1248
01:23:42.843 --> 01:23:45.455
<i>Your rage
gave me my life's work.</i>

1249
01:23:45.629 --> 01:23:48.632
<i>And in exchange
I give you your life.</i>

1250
01:23:50.373 --> 01:23:52.940
<i>You just remember that. Marcus.</i>

1251
01:23:53.115 --> 01:23:54.594
<i>If you ever get the itch</i>

1252
01:23:54.768 --> 01:23:57.249
<i>to come back
to the stalking fields.</i>

1253
01:24:03.212 --> 01:24:04.430
I'm so sorry.

1255
01:24:19.141 --> 01:24:20.640
- Come on. Let's go.
- Hey. hey. hey man.

1256
01:24:20.664 --> 01:24:23.014
Come on.
Hey man. Snap out of it.

1257
01:24:24.668 --> 01:24:26.017
Look. I know you're hurt.

1258
01:24:26.191 --> 01:24:27.751
but we can't do anything
if you're dead.

1259
01:24:27.845 --> 01:24:29.475
We... we need your help
to get out of this.

1260
01:24:29.499 --> 01:24:30.674
Come on.

1261
01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:37.376

You got this.

1266
01:25:06.884 --> 01:25:08.190
You need to go.
