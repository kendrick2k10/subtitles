Breaking news here. guys.
out of Hollywood this morning.

C-list actor...
C-list actor...

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:37.001
Let's upgrade him.
The devoted actor...

Longtime actor...
Emerging actor...

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:42.545
Up-and-coming actor.
John Durfy Junior. has died.

10
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.843
What?
What?

11
00:00:43.878 --> 00:00:45.383
Apparently.
he was attempting a stunt

12
00:00:45.418 --> 00:00:47.583
to prepare for his upcoming role
as Harry Houdini.

13
00:00:47.618 --> 00:00:48.683
Whoa.
He got the gig.

14
00:00:48.718 --> 00:00:50.047
This story is crazy.

15
00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:52.687
So. allegedly.
Mr. Durfy was a method actor

16
00:00:52.722 --> 00:00:54.854
and was working with
a retired magician.

17
00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:56.856
For those who don't understand
method acting.

18
00:00:56.891 --> 00:00:59.397
it's usually when
one actor decides
to take it really seriously

19
00:00:59.432 --> 00:01:01.168
and bums out everyone else
on the set.

20
00:01:01.203 --> 00:01:03.236
He needs a better method.
He was doin' a stunt.

21
00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:04.666
Stunt went wrong--
Stunt gone wrong--

22
00:01:04.701 --> 00:01:06.206
Sounds like a stunt
gone wrong right there.

23
00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:08.274
Yeah. it did.
I mean. it really went wrong.

24
00:01:08.309 --> 00:01:12.773
Durfy died during a stunt
gone wrong involving Durfy
being handcuffed...

25
00:01:12.808 --> 00:01:14.907
Attempting to swallow a...

26
00:01:14.942 --> 00:01:16.106
A key?

27
00:01:16.141 --> 00:01:18.713
[all]
...he tragically choked on.

28
00:01:18.748 --> 00:01:21.254
Entertainment sources say
it's another senseless death

29
00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.388
at the hands of method acting.

30
00:01:23.423 --> 00:01:24.752
That is sad news.
[cohost] Wow.

31
00:01:24.787 --> 00:01:26.589
What a terrible tragedy.
Whew.

32
00:01:26.624 --> 00:01:29.361
John Durfy Junior.
may he rest in peace.

I-- I can't believe it.
I just can't believe it.

35
00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.698
[sniffles]
Neither can I.

36
00:02:10.536 --> 00:02:11.997
I feel like
I just saw him.

37
00:02:13.374 --> 00:02:15.440
Yeah. he just called me
last week.

38
00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.676
It was a butt-dial.
but still...

39
00:02:21.712 --> 00:02:23.217
It's just not real.

40
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.352
It can't be real.

41
00:02:26.387 --> 00:02:28.387
Hey.
what if it's not real?

42
00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:30.587
It's real. Zane.

43
00:02:31.854 --> 00:02:33.260
So where's Shelly?

44
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.187
[Doc] He's outside.
He needed a minute.

45
00:02:37.222 --> 00:02:39.332
[bell tolling]
[crying]

46
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.437
[speaker]
I think we can get started.

47
00:02:45.472 --> 00:02:48.000
I wanna thank everybody
for being here today

48
00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.641
to honor
the life of my brother.

49
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.205
Murphy John Durfy Junior.

50
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.109
It means a lot.
His name was Murphy Durfy?

51
00:02:58.144 --> 00:02:59.319
I had no idea.

52
00:02:59.354 --> 00:03:00.551
I didn't know that.
Shh. Doc.

53
00:03:00.586 --> 00:03:02.487
Since Mom and Dad passed.

54
00:03:02.522 --> 00:03:07.888
it's just been
me and my brother
and my sister.

55
00:03:07.923 --> 00:03:10.693
I wanna thank Uncle Tommy
for comin' all the way up
from Texas.

56
00:03:13.566 --> 00:03:15.126
Thanks. Tommy.

57
00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:17.304
What?

58
00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:21.099
You know. Durfy was older
than I am. but I always
felt like the big brother.

59
00:03:22.938 --> 00:03:24.443
Always looked after him.

60
00:03:25.446 --> 00:03:26.940
Tried to do my best.

61
00:03:29.747 --> 00:03:31.582
Standin' up here today.
I realize...

62
00:03:33.388 --> 00:03:35.322
maybe I didn't do enough.

63
00:03:35.357 --> 00:03:37.247
Oh. hell no. Jack.

64
00:03:37.282 --> 00:03:39.986
No. you were the best brother
he could ever ask for.

65
00:03:40.021 --> 00:03:44.298
Hell. if they had a--
a buckle for best brother.

66
00:03:44.333 --> 00:03:46.333
yours would be
the size of Texas.

67
00:03:46.368 --> 00:03:47.796
Go Cowboys!

68
00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:49.127
[mourners murmur]

69
00:03:49.162 --> 00:03:51.030
[Jack] Thank you. Tommy.
Appreciate that.

70
00:03:51.065 --> 00:03:51.932
What?
Okay.

71
00:03:51.967 --> 00:03:54.374
[sniffles] Anyway.

72
00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:58.972
if anybody would like to
get up here and share a memory.
now's the time.

73
00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:03.581
"Durfy was my friend.
and when I lost my nuts.
Durfy treated me--

74
00:04:03.616 --> 00:04:06.716
always treated me
like a person who had nuts."
[cries]

75
00:04:18.092 --> 00:04:19.630
[grunts]

76
00:04:35.142 --> 00:04:36.647
Hi. everybody. I'm Bob.

77
00:04:39.344 --> 00:04:41.586
Me and these guys
grew up with Durf.

78
00:04:42.754 --> 00:04:44.787
As you can see. we're--
we're pack animals.

79
00:04:44.822 --> 00:04:46.822
We practically
raised each other.

80
00:04:48.023 --> 00:04:49.396
We're family.

81
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.666
[sighs] And when we were kids.
we started this thing
called the Buddy Games.

82
00:04:56.999 --> 00:05:00.836
It started as Wiffle ball
in the backyard. and--

83
00:05:00.871 --> 00:05:03.267
Well. it evolved
into a tradition

84
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.808
that continues even today.

85
00:05:06.877 --> 00:05:08.415
It's ours.

86
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.208
And Durfy...

87
00:05:16.084 --> 00:05:17.787
And Durfy showed up...

88
00:05:19.725 --> 00:05:22.187
No matter where he was in life.
he always showed up.

89
00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:26.026
We all did.

90
00:05:26.061 --> 00:05:28.996
We show up for each other.
I mean. that's the point. right?

91
00:05:30.901 --> 00:05:32.329
Well. today...

92
00:05:35.367 --> 00:05:36.905
today we're down a man.

93
00:05:39.074 --> 00:05:42.878
And I-I-- I just...
I don't think any of us
can believe it.

94
00:05:42.913 --> 00:05:45.012
[Jack]
You know. I remember loanin'--

95
00:05:45.047 --> 00:05:49.489
loanin' Durfy some money
for a few of those Buddy Games.

96
00:05:49.524 --> 00:05:52.789
Even though I thought
they were a little lame
and a total waste of time.

97
00:05:52.824 --> 00:05:56.628
[mourners chuckle]
They were important to him.
and that's what mattered.

98
00:05:57.598 --> 00:05:59.059
'Cause that's
what brothers do.

99
00:05:59.798 --> 00:06:01.193
Thank you. Bob.

100
00:06:01.228 --> 00:06:04.031
Would anyone else
like to come up and share?

101
00:06:04.066 --> 00:06:06.000
Yeah. I--
I'd like to say somethin'.

102
00:06:06.035 --> 00:06:07.441
That's why we're here. Jack.

103
00:06:08.103 --> 00:06:09.135
Go. buddy.

104
00:06:12.877 --> 00:06:14.074
It's okay.

105
00:06:14.109 --> 00:06:15.240
Durfy...

106
00:06:16.782 --> 00:06:19.376
He wasn't just
one of my best friends.

107
00:06:21.886 --> 00:06:25.283
He was also my first patient
as a chiropractor.

108
00:06:26.451 --> 00:06:28.022
When I got certified.

109
00:06:28.057 --> 00:06:31.289
everyone was too scared
to have me work on 'em.

110
00:06:33.095 --> 00:06:35.128
Except for Durfy. [chuckles]

111
00:06:36.736 --> 00:06:39.737
He never sued me.
Doesn't matter
how bad I hurt him.

112
00:06:39.772 --> 00:06:41.167
[mourners chuckle]

113
00:06:41.202 --> 00:06:43.070
Oh. and I hurt him.

114
00:06:43.105 --> 00:06:44.302
[all laughing]

115
00:06:46.614 --> 00:06:48.339
Okay. great.

116
00:06:48.374 --> 00:06:49.747
[Zane] Thanks. Jack.
That--

117
00:06:49.782 --> 00:06:51.408
Uh. Zane here. [chuckles]

118
00:06:53.786 --> 00:06:57.755
Durfy had such
a beautiful heart.
[chuckles]

119
00:06:59.418 --> 00:07:03.321
He was the first person
that I ever told that I was gay.

120
00:07:05.193 --> 00:07:06.995
That's right.

121
00:07:07.965 --> 00:07:09.734
You're not alone. Uncle Tommy.

122
00:07:09.769 --> 00:07:11.395
[clears throat]

123
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.738
I knew that I could trust him.

124
00:07:15.973 --> 00:07:18.303
And I knew that
he would never judge me.

125
00:07:20.945 --> 00:07:22.780
And he kept my secret for...

126
00:07:23.475 --> 00:07:25.552
for decades.

127
00:07:25.587 --> 00:07:29.149
Until I came out again
to Doc on his table.
[chuckles]

128
00:07:29.184 --> 00:07:31.283
Isn't that right. Doc?
[laughs]
Yeah.

129
00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:35.694
Durfy also
helped me put together
my first leather swing set.

130
00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:38.158
[mourners chuckle]
If you all don't know
what that is...

131
00:07:38.193 --> 00:07:39.962
Okay. Zane. that was great.
...it's an indoor...

132
00:07:39.997 --> 00:07:41.359
Zane. that was great.
It's for indoors.

133
00:07:41.394 --> 00:07:43.031
Zane. I think
they'll figure it out.

134
00:07:43.066 --> 00:07:45.429
[Bender]
Well. Murphy Durfy.

135
00:07:45.464 --> 00:07:49.235
I met Durfy in kindergarten.
That's how far back we go.

136
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.402
I was on the playground.
picking my nose.

137
00:07:51.437 --> 00:07:54.647
Kid walks up. laughs at me.
punches me in the face.

138
00:07:54.682 --> 00:07:57.441
This squirrelly kid named Durfy
tackled that kid.

139
00:07:57.476 --> 00:07:58.816
pinned him down.

140
00:07:58.851 --> 00:08:01.511
and he goes.
"You think that's funny?

141
00:08:01.546 --> 00:08:02.853
'Cause it's snot."

142
00:08:02.888 --> 00:08:04.283
[all laughing]

143
00:08:04.318 --> 00:08:06.087
And he proceeded to
pick the kid's nose

144
00:08:06.122 --> 00:08:09.695
and slap the kid's boogers
right in his face.

145
00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.961
Then I joined in.
It was just pick and slap.

146
00:08:11.996 --> 00:08:13.765
Pick and slap. pick and slap.

147
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.767
Okay. Bender. Bender.

148
00:08:15.802 --> 00:08:18.297
That's enough
from you guys. okay?

149
00:08:18.332 --> 00:08:20.167
You know. you're the reason
we're here. right?

150
00:08:20.202 --> 00:08:23.038
All the partyin'
and your stupid
fuckin' Buddy Games.

151
00:08:23.073 --> 00:08:24.677
Look where it got you.

152
00:08:24.712 --> 00:08:26.910
You're nothin' but single.
middle-aged losers.

153
00:08:26.945 --> 00:08:29.077
You never grew up.
[imitates fart]

154
00:08:29.112 --> 00:08:31.475
[mourners chuckle]

155
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.378
I got this. Jack.

156
00:08:33.413 --> 00:08:35.721
Now. I've heard
just about enough
of this shit.

157
00:08:35.756 --> 00:08:37.756
There are three
important things in life:

158
00:08:37.791 --> 00:08:40.924
hard work. determination
and the good book.

159
00:08:40.959 --> 00:08:43.025
And that all went out the window

160
00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:47.733
when he started hangin' out
with his buddies
instead of his family.

161
00:08:47.768 --> 00:08:50.329
And look.
he didn't even have kids.
Hell. I got nine!

162
00:08:50.364 --> 00:08:53.706
That's right. And tellin' him
that he needed to be an actor

163
00:08:53.741 --> 00:08:55.906
instead of followin'
in the family business

164
00:08:55.941 --> 00:08:57.237
and doin' good. honest work?

165
00:08:57.272 --> 00:08:59.338
No. he goes chasin' dreams.

166
00:08:59.373 --> 00:09:02.506
Well. I've said it once.
I'll say it again.
dreams are stupid!

167
00:09:02.541 --> 00:09:04.409
Exactly right!

168
00:09:04.444 --> 00:09:06.950
I've said it nine times!

169
00:09:06.985 --> 00:09:09.381
Don't chase your dreams.
What?

170
00:09:09.416 --> 00:09:12.186
Come on.
[Jack] Finally. somebody's
speakin' some sense around here.

171
00:09:12.221 --> 00:09:16.256
Jack. we only encouraged Durfy
to do what made him happy. okay?
That's what friends do.

172

I'm a trained professional.

674
00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:53.684
Hold him. guys.
Did I get her number?

675
00:30:54.522 --> 00:30:57.325
[groans] Ow. ow.

676
00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:58.326
My nose...

677
00:30:58.361 --> 00:30:59.932
[screams]
There you go.

678
00:30:59.967 --> 00:31:02.495
Oh. fuckin' biscuits and gravy.

679
00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:04.101
Doc. don't... Ow.

680
00:31:04.136 --> 00:31:07.269
[Doc] Just go like...
[scream echoes]

681
00:31:09.636 --> 00:31:11.075
Good as new.

682
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:13.374
Yeah. I know you enjoyed that.

683
00:31:13.409 --> 00:31:15.046
Little bit. Little bit.

684
00:31:15.081 --> 00:31:17.477
Oh. there you are.

685
00:31:17.941 --> 00:31:19.952
You lost.

686
00:31:19.987 --> 00:31:22.988
But. hey.
I didn't think you'd make it
past the first round.

687
00:31:23.023 --> 00:31:26.090
Pretty impressive
for a bunch of old dicks.

688
00:31:26.125 --> 00:31:29.291
You're older
than we are. Marty.
Okay. boomer. don't flex.

689
00:31:29.326 --> 00:31:31.524
Don't talk like that.
You have gray pubic hair.

690
00:31:31.559 --> 00:31:34.725
I am sorry I didn't
tell you guys when
I started the games. okay?

691
00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.629
But I never expected
to see you again. ever.

692
00:31:37.664 --> 00:31:40.929
So what do you say?
Can we call it even?
Yes. Yes. please.

693
00:31:40.964 --> 00:31:42.799
So. where's that
other friend of yours?

694
00:31:42.834 --> 00:31:45.043
You remember. that goofy guy
who was in love
with my waitress?

695
00:31:45.078 --> 00:31:46.572
Durf. yeah.

696
00:31:50.875 --> 00:31:53.150
Oh. shit. man.
I'm sorry to hear that.

697
00:31:53.185 --> 00:31:55.548
What brings you back here now?

698
00:31:55.583 --> 00:31:57.220
We were gonna spread
his ashes at the lake.

699
00:31:57.255 --> 00:31:59.453
but it was spring break.
and it was a full-on shit show.

700
00:31:59.488 --> 00:32:02.225
Oh. man. So. where
are you gonna do it?

701
00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:04.227
I don't know.
It's gettin' dark.

702
00:32:04.262 --> 00:32:06.625
I guess we'll find
a place to stay
and figure it out tomorrow.

703
00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:08.429
Good luck with that.

704
00:32:08.464 --> 00:32:09.760
We're all booked up around here.
It's spring break.

705
00:32:09.795 --> 00:32:11.894
Oh. that's just great.
Shit.

706
00:32:11.929 --> 00:32:12.796
Fuck.

707
00:32:15.405 --> 00:32:16.899
[Marty] Oh. um...

708
00:32:19.838 --> 00:32:21.706
You should probably
have this.

709
00:32:21.741 --> 00:32:23.444
Oh. Durf!
That's the girl.

710
00:32:23.479 --> 00:32:25.776
[Doc] Look how young he is.
[Bender] Yes. that's her.

711
00:32:25.811 --> 00:32:27.349
What's her name again?
Celia.

712
00:32:27.384 --> 00:32:29.219
Yeah. that's right. Celia.

713
00:32:29.254 --> 00:32:31.815
She left here about the same
time this photo was taken.

714
00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:33.421
Cute girl. real sweet.

715
00:32:33.456 --> 00:32:35.654
[chuckles]
Real country though.

716
00:32:35.689 --> 00:32:38.162
You know. she quit
after I banned you guys.

717
00:32:38.197 --> 00:32:41.594
but I'll tell you somethin'.
she was in love
with your friend.

718
00:32:41.629 --> 00:32:44.927
Wow. God. remember
he talked about her
for years?

719
00:32:44.962 --> 00:32:47.039
He never stopped.
Where does she live now?

720
00:32:47.074 --> 00:32:49.107
Well. last I heard.

721
00:32:49.142 --> 00:32:52.737
she. uh. moved to a small town
not too far from here
called Backwater.

722
00:32:52.772 --> 00:32:54.871
Right. the backwater town
is called Backwater?

723
00:32:54.906 --> 00:32:56.477
[chuckles]
[phone ringing]

724
00:32:56.512 --> 00:32:58.446
All right. well.
thank you. Marty.

725
00:32:58.481 --> 00:33:00.151
I appreciate it.
[Marty] No worries.

726
00:33:00.186 --> 00:33:01.548
Oh. it's Zane.
Hey. hey. hey.

727
00:33:01.583 --> 00:33:03.121
Oh. nice.
How you doin'?

728
00:33:03.156 --> 00:33:04.320
Hi. Zane!
You okay?

729
00:33:04.355 --> 00:33:05.618
You look completely different.

730
00:33:05.653 --> 00:33:07.356
<i>Yeah. I had to change it up.</i>

731
00:33:07.391 --> 00:33:09.787
<i>Bob. I'm startin' to</i>
<i>get freaked out. man.</i>

732
00:33:09.822 --> 00:33:11.954
<i>Jack got ahold of</i>
<i>my phone number somehow.</i>

733
00:33:11.989 --> 00:33:15.331
<i>He keeps calling and calling</i>
<i>and leaving these</i>
<i>very threatening voice mails.</i>

734
00:33:15.366 --> 00:33:17.069
I can hear Uncle Tommy
in the background.

735
00:33:17.104 --> 00:33:19.566
twirling his mustache
and polishing his fucking gun.

736
00:33:19.601 --> 00:33:22.371
Hey. he's just
playin' mind games.
Block that shit. bro.

737
00:33:22.406 --> 00:33:24.307
Yeah. but if he
already has my number.

738
00:33:24.342 --> 00:33:26.540
who's to say
he hasn't figured out
where I live too. Doc?

739
00:33:26.575 --> 00:33:28.575
Listen to Doc.
Stay calm. don't engage.

740
00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:30.346
He's just trying
to get information out of you.

741
00:33:30.381 --> 00:33:33.217
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Yeah. you're probably right.</i>

742
00:33:33.252 --> 00:33:35.318
<i>I just wish I hadn't</i>
<i>smacked him in the balls.</i>

743
00:33:35.353 --> 00:33:38.222
<i>By the way. Jack...</i>
<i>all broomstick.</i>

744
00:33:38.257 --> 00:33:40.015
[Bob] Who's that?
<i>Who's who?</i>

745
00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:42.094
I see a little silhouetto
of a man.

746
00:33:43.427 --> 00:33:44.954
Oh. [chuckles]

747
00:33:44.989 --> 00:33:47.231
That's Whitley.
He's my new lover.

748
00:33:49.268 --> 00:33:51.169
<i>What?</i>

749
00:33:51.204 --> 00:33:55.668
Uh. nothin'. I don't know.
You guys just kinda look alike.

750
00:33:55.703 --> 00:33:58.539
Yeah. Doc. my life is in danger.
I had to go incognito.

751
00:33:58.574 --> 00:34:02.147
Luckily. Whitley owns a salon.
and he used himself
as a template.

752
00:34:02.182 --> 00:34:03.841
Hey. Wonderbuns.
come here for a sec.

753
00:34:03.876 --> 00:34:05.007
[chuckles] God.

754
00:34:05.042 --> 00:34:06.041
Wonderbuns?

755
00:34:07.385 --> 00:34:09.352
<i>They think we look alike.</i>
<i>Aw.</i>

756
00:34:09.387 --> 00:34:12.047
<i>Which means</i>
<i>you did a fantastic job.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

757
00:34:12.082 --> 00:34:15.556
Dude. it's like where
a person gets a dog. and then
they start to look alike.

758
00:34:15.591 --> 00:34:18.229
It's like that.
except two gay guys.
Yep.

759
00:34:18.264 --> 00:34:20.858
<i>Loud and proud.</i>
<i>Don't hate us</i>
<i>because we're beautiful.</i>

760
00:34:20.893 --> 00:34:23.267
That's not why we hate you.
No. I love it. Zane.

761
00:34:23.302 --> 00:34:25.170
You can literally
go fuck yourself.

762
00:34:25.205 --> 00:34:28.899
[Zane]<i> Bender!</i>
Wow. Your friends seem nice.

763
00:34:29.935 --> 00:34:31.066
[sighs]

764
00:34:31.706 --> 00:34:33.409
<i>Thanks a lot.</i>

765
00:34:33.444 --> 00:34:35.213
<i>Guess I won't be getting</i>
<i>any ass tonight.</i>

766
00:34:35.248 --> 00:34:36.874
Hey. fellas.
time to wrap your shit up.

767
00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:39.151
About five minutes. yeah?
All right. all right.

768
00:34:39.186 --> 00:34:40.284
Okay.

769
00:34:40.319 --> 00:34:41.516
Oh. hey.
check this out. Zane.

770
00:34:42.354 --> 00:34:44.288
Remember her?

771
00:34:44.323 --> 00:34:47.687
That's Celia.
The one Durfy
never stopped talkin' about.

772
00:34:47.722 --> 00:34:49.986
<i>Celia.</i>
<i>Oh. my God. Yes.</i>

773
00:34:50.021 --> 00:34:52.923
Hey. do you think
maybe she'd wanna come with us
to scatter his ashes?

774
00:34:52.958 --> 00:34:55.992
I am loving
the sound of that.
It's so romantic.

775
00:34:56.027 --> 00:34:58.500
That's a solid idea.
I think she'd wanna know.

776
00:34:58.535 --> 00:35:00.766
I think we should find Celia
for Durfy.

777
00:35:00.801 --> 00:35:03.670
Oh. I miss you guys.
I wish I was there with you.

778
00:35:03.705 --> 00:35:06.277
But don't worry about me.
I'll be safe.

779
00:35:06.312 --> 00:35:08.576
Here with Whitley.
In the swing.

780
00:35:08.611 --> 00:35:09.973
All right. buddy.
we'll keep you posted.

781
00:35:10.008 --> 00:35:11.216
Okay. bye.

782
00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:14.516
That's so sweet.

783
00:35:14.551 --> 00:35:16.518
[Whitley]
I need you. Come to me.
Yep.

784
00:35:16.553 --> 00:35:18.652
Where the fuck
are we gonna sleep tonight?

785
00:35:18.687 --> 00:35:21.952
No idea.
[person] You're quite
the gladiator. Bobfather.

786
00:35:26.024 --> 00:35:27.331
I'm sorry.
do I know you?

787
00:35:28.125 --> 00:35:29.663
I go by Phoenix.

788
00:35:31.337 --> 00:35:35.064
I watched you compete.
and I came away quite impressed.

789
00:35:36.133 --> 00:35:37.308
Thank you.

790
00:35:38.773 --> 00:35:40.839
I'd say you and your friends
look lost.

791
00:35:40.874 --> 00:35:43.710
but I know
there's no such thing.

792
00:35:48.519 --> 00:35:50.013
Can I help you with somethin'?

793
00:35:50.048 --> 00:35:52.521
My apologies
if you find my gaze
intimidating.

794
00:35:52.556 --> 00:35:54.787
I believe the surest way
to really know someone

795
00:35:54.822 --> 00:35:56.624
is to look unflinchingly
at them.

796
00:35:56.659 --> 00:35:58.362
Did you lose your spaceship?

797
00:35:58.397 --> 00:36:01.024
[chuckles]

798
00:36:01.059 --> 00:36:03.928
I welcome you and your friends
to a party this evening.

799
00:36:03.963 --> 00:36:04.830
Ooh.

800
00:36:04.865 --> 00:36:06.799
It's the full moon.

801
00:36:06.834 --> 00:36:10.869
And my friends and I
will honor the moon queen
with a bacchanalia.

802
00:36:10.904 --> 00:36:12.640
A fucking alien?
What'd she say?
[Bob] Yeah.

803
00:36:12.675 --> 00:36:14.972
That sounds nice.
but I-- I think we're good.

804
00:36:15.007 --> 00:36:18.679
Be that as it may. I sense
the world has brought you and I
here tonight for a reason.

805
00:36:18.714 --> 00:36:20.285
Who am I to reject fate?

806
00:36:21.244 --> 00:36:22.584
Come to the party.

807
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:28.293
And if you need
a place to sleep.
that can be arranged.

808
00:36:28.328 --> 00:36:32.363
When the moon is high.
find us on the far side
of the lake.

812
00:36:46.313 --> 00:36:49.204
Well. that was weird. man.
[exhales] Oh. my God.

813
00:36:49.239 --> 00:36:50.777
Yeah.

814
00:36:50.812 --> 00:36:52.977
Yeah. but she did offer us
a place to sleep tonight.

815
00:36:53.012 --> 00:36:55.650
Pretty fucking hot too. man.
I just caught a semi.

816
00:36:55.685 --> 00:36:57.322
She said party.

817
00:36:57.357 --> 00:36:59.819
And we're all fuckin' weird.
We should just go.

818
00:37:01.152 --> 00:37:02.888
Let's do this.

00:37:05.189 --> 00:37:07.695

is this party? We're on
the other side of the lake.

821
00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:09.862
[Bob] I don't know. man.
[Doc] This is killin' my buzz.

824
00:37:13.802 --> 00:37:16.671
Doc. she offered us
a place to sleep.
We've got no other option.

825
00:37:16.706 --> 00:37:19.608
Just keep going.
Yeah. we do. Bob. We can
get back in your helicopter

826
00:37:19.643 --> 00:37:22.270
and go to Bumfuck Island
or whatever and find Celia.

827
00:37:22.305 --> 00:37:25.042
Yeah. just show up in
a helicopter in the middle
of the night. unannounced.

828
00:37:25.077 --> 00:37:27.176
People fucking
love that. Bender.
That's a great idea.

829
00:37:27.211 --> 00:37:30.245
I'm sure a lot of people do...
Hey. shut up!
Shut up. you idiots.

[Doc]
I think we found our party.

833
00:37:34.757 --> 00:37:36.625
[Shelly]
Could be any kind of party.

[cheering]

842
00:37:58.616 --> 00:38:00.649
[Shelly] I don't know how to
dance to this kind of music.

843
00:38:00.684 --> 00:38:02.354
I could use a beer.
I'll tell you that.

844
00:38:02.389 --> 00:38:03.883
Yeah. they have beer?
I hope so.

845
00:38:03.918 --> 00:38:05.280
[Bender] I feel like
they have everything.

846
00:38:05.315 --> 00:38:06.721
[Bob] She said she was
gonna be here. right?

847
00:38:06.756 --> 00:38:08.459
There can't possibly be

848
00:38:08.494 --> 00:38:10.923
another giant fuckin' raging
party out here. can there?

849
00:38:10.958 --> 00:38:12.958
[Bob] What was her name again?
That girl?

850
00:38:12.993 --> 00:38:15.191
Falcon?
I have no idea.
Falcon?

851
00:38:15.864 --> 00:38:17.666
[Shelly] Falcon!

852
00:38:17.701 --> 00:38:19.437
[Doc] I only have a few hairs.

853
00:38:19.472 --> 00:38:20.999
Don't burn 'em. please.
[Bob] Do you know a Falcon?

854
00:38:21.034 --> 00:38:22.264
[Doc] Falcon.

855
00:38:22.299 --> 00:38:24.772
Do you guys know
a girl named Falcon?

856
00:38:24.807 --> 00:38:26.741
Friends!

857
00:38:26.776 --> 00:38:30.008
Tonight we welcome
new travelers.

858
00:38:30.043 --> 00:38:33.814
This... is Bobfather.

859
00:38:33.849 --> 00:38:35.651
[crowd] Bobfather.
Hey.

860
00:38:35.686 --> 00:38:38.819
This is. uh--
Enough with
the Western formalities.

861
00:38:38.854 --> 00:38:40.854
Names are anchors.

862
00:38:40.889 --> 00:38:42.955
They will learn
their real names shortly.

863
00:38:44.464 --> 00:38:46.497
The moon decides.

864
00:38:46.532 --> 00:38:48.400
[crowd murmuring]

865
00:38:52.329 --> 00:38:53.999
She calls you...

866
00:38:58.643 --> 00:38:59.741
Beef Chimi.

867
00:38:59.776 --> 00:39:01.204
Beef Chimi?
[crowd] Beef Chimi.

868
00:39:01.239 --> 00:39:02.370
Beef Chimi?
That's good.
That works.

869
00:39:02.405 --> 00:39:03.976
I like it.
I don't hate that.

870
00:39:04.011 --> 00:39:04.944
And you!

Swollen what?

874
00:39:15.352 --> 00:39:17.154
Swollen Tick or Dick?

875
00:39:17.189 --> 00:39:18.386
Hole and dick?

876
00:39:18.421 --> 00:39:20.531
And you. Broken Man.
What?

877
00:39:20.566 --> 00:39:22.797
That's very. uh.
accurate.

[upbeat music plays]
[cheering. applauding]

879
00:39:26.704 --> 00:39:29.738
Here. we reject
capitalist society.

880
00:39:29.773 --> 00:39:33.137
Here. we are dedicated
to anti-consumerism

881
00:39:33.172 --> 00:39:35.678
and self-expression.

882
00:39:35.713 --> 00:39:39.077
And we really like
to party our asses off.

883
00:39:39.112 --> 00:39:40.848
Yeah.
All right.
I like that.

884
00:39:40.883 --> 00:39:44.016
This is Headwound. Sarah?

885
00:39:44.051 --> 00:39:46.117
She will help you
find your journey.

886
00:39:46.152 --> 00:39:48.053
Oh. my God.
Enjoy.

887
00:39:48.088 --> 00:39:49.956
I have others to attend to.

888
00:39:50.728 --> 00:39:52.596
Our paths will cross again.

889
00:39:52.631 --> 00:39:54.862
Look at her head.
Are you okay?

890
00:39:56.701 --> 00:39:58.998
You should probably
get that looked at.
Yeah. it's pretty bad.

891
00:39:59.033 --> 00:40:00.703
Have we met before?

892
00:40:00.738 --> 00:40:01.770
No.

893
00:40:02.641 --> 00:40:04.575
You sure?

894
00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:07.677
Uh...
I can taste
your pheromones.

895
00:40:07.712 --> 00:40:10.812
Hey. can you buy me a drink?
I'll chow your box for a week.

896
00:40:11.617 --> 00:40:12.913
Two wet ones.

897
00:40:12.948 --> 00:40:14.948
My-- My box is. uh.
singing. [chuckles]

898
00:40:14.983 --> 00:40:16.279
Hmm.

899
00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:19.491
Are you sure
we've never met?

900
00:40:20.527 --> 00:40:22.890
Nope.
Okay.

901
00:40:22.925 --> 00:40:24.419
Fuck.
Isn't that the girl from...

902
00:40:24.454 --> 00:40:25.453
I know.

903
00:40:25.488 --> 00:40:29.633
So. what will your journey be?

904
00:40:29.668 --> 00:40:31.261
Yeah...
Yeah. I'm good. man.

905
00:40:31.296 --> 00:40:32.735
No. no. no.
we're good.
Hey. Doc.

906
00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:34.935
What the fuck
are you doin' over there?

907
00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:39.775
Mmm. These shiitakes
taste like shit.
but I'm fuckin' hungry. man.

908
00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:42.173
You guys want some?
Those are magic mushrooms.

909
00:40:43.583 --> 00:40:44.813
Shut the fuck up.

910
00:40:44.848 --> 00:40:46.749
[Shelly laughs]
They are.

911
00:40:46.784 --> 00:40:48.751
Don't fuckin' tell me that.
I just ate ten of these things.

912
00:40:48.786 --> 00:40:50.984
You're gonna trip
your balls off. dude.
Oh. my God.

913
00:40:51.019 --> 00:40:52.953
Fuck. I'm gonna be so high.
[Headwound] Yes.

914
00:40:52.988 --> 00:40:54.592
You're gonna be high
for. like. a week.

915
00:40:54.627 --> 00:40:56.594
Bob. Come on.
you gotta trip with me.

916
00:40:56.629 --> 00:40:58.794
No. I'm not...
Don't make me trip alone. man.

917
00:40:58.829 --> 00:41:00.323
Bender. come on. Please.

918
00:41:00.358 --> 00:41:02.567
Maybe one.
One? I took ten of 'em.

919
00:41:02.602 --> 00:41:04.096
I'm not gonna let you
trip alone.

920
00:41:04.131 --> 00:41:06.065
And also. I think
Durfy would want this.

921
00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:07.935
Yes. Durfy would want this.

922
00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:10.003
Shelly. come on.
I'm not taking
any fuckin' mushrooms.

923
00:41:10.038 --> 00:41:11.466
I'll eat
these pink things. though.

924
00:41:11.501 --> 00:41:12.643
Ooh.

925
00:41:12.678 --> 00:41:14.106
That's fun.

926
00:41:14.141 --> 00:41:15.877
[Doc] Well. maybe
a gummy might mellow me out.

927
00:41:15.912 --> 00:41:17.879
[Bob] I'll have a couple of 'em.

928
00:41:17.914 --> 00:41:19.980
[Bender] I want this one.
Those are good.

929
00:41:20.015 --> 00:41:22.818
What do you recommend?
What goes good with the pink?

930
00:41:22.853 --> 00:41:25.051
Put your hand on things.
and whatever sticks.

931
00:41:26.252 --> 00:41:27.823
Maybe a second one.

932
00:41:27.858 --> 00:41:31.057
I ate too many bees today.
[Bob] You did what?

933
00:41:32.764 --> 00:41:35.292
[Shelly] Oh.
[people moaning]

934
00:41:35.327 --> 00:41:37.734
Well. this feels naughty.
[chuckles]

935
00:41:37.769 --> 00:41:39.197
Hey. man.

936
00:41:39.232 --> 00:41:42.035
Whoa! 'Sup. dudes?
What do you got there?

937
00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:44.169
This?
It's-- It's nothing.

938
00:41:44.204 --> 00:41:46.204
I'm cool. man.
I did acid in Vegas.

939
00:41:46.239 --> 00:41:49.108
Okay. look. Old Man Winter.
you can't handle this.

940
00:41:49.143 --> 00:41:51.011
I can't handle it?
Yeah.

941
00:41:51.046 --> 00:41:52.749
I can't fuckin' handle it?
No.

942
00:41:52.784 --> 00:41:55.444
My wife blew my balls off
with a paint gun. Gimme.

943
00:41:55.479 --> 00:41:57.754
[croaking]

944
00:41:57.789 --> 00:42:00.185
Oh. shit! That's a frog!

945
00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:02.990
It's His Holiness. Toad Ra.

946
00:42:03.025 --> 00:42:05.355
Just one tap of the tongue

947
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:09.194
is the most powerful
hallucinogen in the whole
western hemisphere.

948
00:42:09.229 --> 00:42:11.163
Ew. you lick that fuckin' frog?

949
00:42:11.198 --> 00:42:12.461
Toad.

950
00:42:12.496 --> 00:42:15.134
Gimme.
I can't be responsible. man.

951
00:42:15.169 --> 00:42:18.676
Gimme the frog.
Some people never come back
from this. friend.

952
00:42:18.711 --> 00:42:22.042
Oh. yeah? Hello. froggy.
[laughing]

953
00:42:22.077 --> 00:42:23.780
[croaking]

954
00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:31.920
Just one tap is enough
to dissolve all consciousness...

955
00:42:31.955 --> 00:42:33.317
What are you doing. man?

956
00:42:34.617 --> 00:42:37.288
That's an abomination!
Yo. give me that back. man.

957
00:42:38.423 --> 00:42:41.424
Do you have any idea
what you just did?

958
00:42:44.066 --> 00:42:45.527
No. dude!
[croaks]

959
00:42:45.562 --> 00:42:47.529
Holy...
Yo. give me that back.
Give me that.

960
00:42:47.564 --> 00:42:49.267
[Shelly]
I'll eat that fuckin' frog. bro.

961
00:42:49.302 --> 00:42:50.642
Who are you. man?

962
00:42:50.677 --> 00:42:52.534
You're welcome. sweetheart.
[laughs]

963
00:42:52.569 --> 00:42:54.646
Yeah. whatever. man.
Let's get outta here.

964
00:42:54.681 --> 00:42:58.749
Puffnuts. Butterscotch.
this guy's about to
go fuckin' nuts. man.

965
00:43:00.753 --> 00:43:03.886
See that. ladies?
I perform amphibalingous.

966
00:43:03.921 --> 00:43:07.219
Who wants to fuck?

967
00:43:07.254 --> 00:43:08.957
I do have to poop though.

968
00:43:16.736 --> 00:43:19.165
What is this.
some kind of a staring contest?

969
00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:25.776
No. this is the most intense
eye-gazing session
I've ever encountered.

970
00:43:25.811 --> 00:43:27.272
Eye-gazing?

971
00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.011
Not just the eyes.

972
00:43:30.574 --> 00:43:31.606
The soul.

973
00:43:32.983 --> 00:43:35.313
I can see your past life.

974
00:43:36.019 --> 00:43:38.481
<i>You are Sasquatch.</i>

975
00:43:38.516 --> 00:43:40.791
[chuckling]
I'm sorry.

976
00:43:40.826 --> 00:43:43.794
but there's
not enough drugs in the world
to make this interesting.

977
00:43:43.829 --> 00:43:45.620
Look.

978
00:43:45.655 --> 00:43:48.062
This isn't gonna work on me.
It's just--
<i>Deep.</i>

979
00:43:49.461 --> 00:43:50.702
Deep.

980
00:43:53.839 --> 00:43:56.466
You are good.

981
00:44:02.672 --> 00:44:05.915
Hey. what's up. man?
Do you have tequila or vodka?

982
00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:07.983
Hi. Um. no.
neither of those.

983
00:44:08.018 --> 00:44:10.414
What I do have
are supplies.

984
00:44:10.449 --> 00:44:12.317
I want a cocktail.
not a crayon.

985
00:44:12.352 --> 00:44:13.890
This is just. um--

986
00:44:13.925 --> 00:44:15.991
It's fun. it's soothing.

987
00:44:16.026 --> 00:44:18.697
Yeah. so is jerking off.
but I don't do that
in front of strangers.

988
00:44:19.722 --> 00:44:21.062
Okay.
Do you have whiskey?

989
00:44:21.097 --> 00:44:22.162
Just hear me out.

990
00:44:22.197 --> 00:44:23.559
I think we. as a society.

991
00:44:23.594 --> 00:44:26.738
I think we fail to satisfy
our inner child.

992
00:44:26.773 --> 00:44:28.938
Do you have
a crayon-flavored vodka?

993
00:44:28.973 --> 00:44:32.073
Uh. I think--
I think we both know
that's not a thing.

994
00:44:32.108 --> 00:44:33.668
Oh. who's that?

995
00:44:33.703 --> 00:44:35.912
Is that a good boy?
That's a good boy.

996
00:44:35.947 --> 00:44:38.277
Would you not
refer to them that way?

997
00:44:38.312 --> 00:44:40.411
What do you mean. "them"?
I'm talking to the dog.

998
00:44:40.446 --> 00:44:43.051
It's just that
you're using heteronormative.
cisgendered pronouns.

999
00:44:43.086 --> 00:44:44.712
and-- and we don't love that.

1000
00:44:44.747 --> 00:44:47.055
It's offensive.
No idea what you just said.

1001
00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:48.991
You're assuming
the dog's a male.

1002
00:44:49.026 --> 00:44:52.093
I'm not assuming.
I'm just staring
at his nuts right now.

1003
00:44:52.128 --> 00:44:56.295
I think you're suffering
from some pretty severe
toxic masculinity. okay?

1004
00:44:56.330 --> 00:44:58.066
I find it triggering.
I'm regressing.

1005
00:44:58.101 --> 00:45:00.464
So can you get the fuck
out of my room. Dad?

1006
00:45:01.137 --> 00:45:02.906
Okay.

Yes.

1009
00:45:15.052 --> 00:45:16.381
Of course.

1010
00:45:18.286 --> 00:45:19.417
Wait.

1011
00:45:20.453 --> 00:45:22.024
Where are we?

1012
00:45:22.059 --> 00:45:23.223
Where we belong.

1013
00:45:23.258 --> 00:45:25.390
I feel so peaceful.

1014
00:45:25.425 --> 00:45:26.897

1015
00:45:26.932 --> 00:45:28.393

1025

1026

are amazing.

1028

1029
00:46:07.104 --> 00:46:08.466
I agree. but...

1030
00:46:08.501 --> 00:46:09.940
But what?

1031
00:46:09.975 --> 00:46:11.601
I don't wanna offend you.

1032
00:46:11.636 --> 00:46:13.537
as you're clearly trying
to form a connection here.

1033
00:46:13.572 --> 00:46:15.572
but I'd be remiss
not to point out your use

1034
00:46:15.607 --> 00:46:17.981
of northern hemisphere-specific
seasonal language.

1035
00:46:18.918 --> 00:46:20.148
Okay. you-- you lost me.

1036
00:46:20.183 --> 00:46:22.282
Just a tiny
inclusive language thing.

1037
00:46:22.317 --> 00:46:24.053
Yeah. I--
I still don't understand.

1038
00:46:24.088 --> 00:46:27.419
Well. instead of summer.
I like to say August.

1039
00:46:27.454 --> 00:46:31.555
Or even third quarter.
because although it might be
that warm season for me.

1040
00:46:31.590 --> 00:46:34.525
it's not that warm season
for everybody else.

1041
00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:36.395
We're all
in the same hemisphere here.

1042
00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:38.826
Sure. but it's winter
in New Zealand.

1043
00:46:38.861 --> 00:46:40.432
But we're not in New Zealand.

1044
00:46:40.467 --> 00:46:42.170
Is anybody here in New Zealand?

1045
00:46:42.205 --> 00:46:44.139
I'm just trying
to spread respect
and understanding.

1046
00:46:44.174 --> 00:46:45.437
Is that a problem?

1047
00:46:45.978 --> 00:46:47.538
No.

1048
00:46:47.573 --> 00:46:52.917
No. No. I was just... admiring
the third-quarter stars.

1049
00:46:52.952 --> 00:46:55.414
I appreciate your openness.
Bobfather!

1050
00:46:55.449 --> 00:46:57.350
Just the man
I was looking for.
Come.

1051
00:46:57.385 --> 00:46:59.484
There's something
I wanna show you.
Okay. Okay.

1052
00:47:00.487 --> 00:47:02.619
Enjoy the evening.

1053
00:47:02.654 --> 00:47:05.259
[Phoenix] I knew.
upon first seeing you. that you
were just the sort of man

1054
00:47:05.294 --> 00:47:08.196
I have been both avoiding
and looking for
for quite some time.

1055
00:47:08.231 --> 00:47:09.824
[Bob]
And what kind of man is that?

1056
00:47:09.859 --> 00:47:11.903
Let's just say. of a time.

1057
00:47:11.938 --> 00:47:13.498
Uh...
Old-fashioned.

1058
00:47:13.533 --> 00:47:16.369
Macho. manly.

[scoffs] Okay.

emotionally available
and sensitive these days.

1061

You catch them crying
over cat food commercials.

1062
00:47:26.645 --> 00:47:29.514
So. what are you trying to say?
You're-- You're into older men?

1063
00:47:30.913 --> 00:47:32.583
No.
Oh.

1064
00:47:32.618 --> 00:47:36.818
I have a thing
for competition.
Uh-huh.

1065
00:47:36.853 --> 00:47:41.691
Years of toxic relationships
have led to much introspection
and soul-sculpting

1066
00:47:41.726 --> 00:47:45.035
to reach the heightened form
you see before you now.

1067
00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:50.106

like a snake sheds...

1069
00:47:54.046 --> 00:47:57.476
I'm sorry.
where are we going?
And yet. I can't help myself.

1070
00:47:57.511 --> 00:48:01.678
Seeing you and your comrades
ignited a dormant creature
in me. yes!

1071
00:48:01.713 --> 00:48:04.285
I feel the burning desire
to compete.

1072
00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:07.519
And it burns. Bobfather.
It burns.

1073
00:48:07.554 --> 00:48:11.358
The young reject competition.
but I know now that it
is the great equalizer.

1074
00:48:11.393 --> 00:48:13.162
It drives us to oneness.

1075
00:48:13.197 --> 00:48:16.726
One can be both mindful
and still strive for victory.
yes?

1076
00:48:16.761 --> 00:48:19.135
I hadn't really
thought about it.
There you are.

1077
00:48:19.170 --> 00:48:20.972
Can we leave?
These people suck.

1078
00:48:21.007 --> 00:48:21.973
Come!

So. this is your place?

1174
00:54:04.647 --> 00:54:06.713
Xanadu. my home.
The fruits of my labor.

1175
00:54:06.748 --> 00:54:09.320
Yeah. it's cool.
Why does the house talk?

1176
00:54:09.355 --> 00:54:13.885
That's K.A.R.E.N.
It stands for Kind Automated
Righteous Emotional Neurobot.

1177
00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:15.425
She runs my household.

1178
00:54:16.725 --> 00:54:18.956
So. what is it that you do?

1179
00:54:18.991 --> 00:54:20.056
Do?

1180
00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:24.258
I guess you could say

1181
00:54:24.293 --> 00:54:27.965
I simply exist
in this human vessel

1182
00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.803
to spread
my love and knowledge

1183
00:54:30.838 --> 00:54:35.478
to lift up other souls
and guide them
towards enlightenment.

1184
00:54:35.513 --> 00:54:37.744
So that paid for this?

1185
00:54:37.779 --> 00:54:42.243
Also. I created an app
that translates dog barks
into emojis.

1186
00:54:42.278 --> 00:54:44.751
While I don't subscribe
to paper currency.

1187
00:54:44.786 --> 00:54:47.985
I will admit
it was a necessary sacrifice
of my talents

1188
00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:50.218
to provide this sanctuary.

1189
00:54:50.253 --> 00:54:52.396
Plus. I really love jet skis.
[exclaims]

1190
00:54:52.431 --> 00:54:54.530
Yeah! Jet skis.
Hey. yeah. so do we.

1191
00:54:54.565 --> 00:54:56.092
Gotta have money for that.
Yeah.

1192
00:54:56.127 --> 00:54:58.226
Oh. perfect!

1193
00:54:58.261 --> 00:55:00.833
We've prepared
some morning cordials I think
will be to your liking.

1194
00:55:00.868 --> 00:55:02.967
Bloody Mary. yes. please.

1195
00:55:03.002 --> 00:55:05.233
This will help
make this place less weird.

1196
00:55:05.268 --> 00:55:06.707
Thank you.
No offense.

1197
00:55:07.974 --> 00:55:10.271
Mmm.
God bless vodka.
Mmm.

1198
00:55:10.306 --> 00:55:11.778
Don't thank God.
thank K.A.R.E.N.

1199
00:55:11.813 --> 00:55:13.648
She scanned your bodies
during your slumber.

1200
00:55:13.683 --> 00:55:15.452
so she knows
just what you like.

1201
00:55:15.487 --> 00:55:16.816
Is that why I had a boner?
Wait.

1202
00:55:16.851 --> 00:55:19.621
What do you mean
she scanned our bodies?

1203
00:55:19.656 --> 00:55:23.284
Where are Shelly and-- and Doc?
We really should
probably get goin'.

1204
00:55:23.319 --> 00:55:24.351
Yeah.

1205
00:55:24.386 --> 00:55:26.463
Who?
Shelly and Doc.

1206
00:55:26.498 --> 00:55:30.192
Our f-- Uh...
Swollen Tick and Beef Chimi.

1207
00:55:30.227 --> 00:55:32.194
The fake doctor and the guy
who looks like Gargamel?

1208
00:55:32.229 --> 00:55:35.164
I assure you. everyone
who is meant to be here is here.

1209
00:55:36.035 --> 00:55:37.441
Now please.

1210
00:55:37.476 --> 00:55:40.202
help yourselves and drink up.

1211
00:55:40.237 --> 00:55:42.171
It will help you. I promise.

1212
00:55:42.206 --> 00:55:45.042
I will leave you to prepare
for the morning commitment.

1213
00:55:46.375 --> 00:55:47.814
I will see you there.

1214
00:55:49.081 --> 00:55:50.718
See you there.

1215
00:55:50.753 --> 00:55:52.720
Morning commitment?
Does that mean
they're here?

1216
00:55:52.755 --> 00:55:55.217
I'm gonna--
I'm gonna go find them.
This is so weird.

1217
00:56:05.702 --> 00:56:06.899
Doc. Shelly.

1218
00:56:07.572 --> 00:56:09.066
Time to get up.

1219
00:56:09.101 --> 00:56:10.837
We got breakfast. buddy.

1220
00:56:10.872 --> 00:56:12.201
[doorknob rattles]

1221
00:56:14.777 --> 00:56:16.744
Doc. Shelly.

1222
00:56:16.779 --> 00:56:18.878
Let's go.
We got Bloody Marys. Let's go.

1223
00:56:18.913 --> 00:56:20.451
[doorknob rattles]

1224
00:56:23.588 --> 00:56:25.588
[K.A.R.E.N.]<i> Hello. Bob.</i>

1225
00:56:25.623 --> 00:56:30.384
<i>Just a reminder</i>
<i>that breakfast service</i>
<i>will end promptly at 10:00 a.m.</i>

1226
00:56:30.419 --> 00:56:33.354
<i>It is now 9:50 a.m.</i>

1227
00:56:33.389 --> 00:56:36.731
<i>Please find your way</i>
<i>to the Great Room</i>
<i>while supplies last.</i>

1228
00:56:36.766 --> 00:56:39.734
<i>There will be</i>
<i>no other meals until dusk.</i>

1229
00:56:54.652 --> 00:56:56.443
I didn't find 'em.

1230
00:56:56.478 --> 00:56:59.248
And honestly. this place
is just creepin' me out.

1231
00:56:59.283 --> 00:57:01.217
I'm gonna go outside
and try to call 'em.

1232
00:57:01.252 --> 00:57:03.384
[English accent]
That's a good idea. Gary.

1233
00:57:03.419 --> 00:57:08.422
I've had three Bloody Marys.
and they're pure magic.

1234
00:57:08.457 --> 00:57:09.764
What? How-- [sighs]

1235
00:57:09.799 --> 00:57:11.733
And they are powerful.

1236
00:57:11.768 --> 00:57:13.427
Okay.
I feel like really.
really good.

1237
00:57:13.462 --> 00:57:15.396
I-- I think we probably
shouldn't split up.

1238
00:57:15.431 --> 00:57:16.870
Come with me.
[normal voice] Okay.

1239
00:57:16.905 --> 00:57:18.674
Come on.
No. Leave it.

1240
00:57:19.303 --> 00:57:20.643
Okay.
Let's go.

1241
00:57:21.404 --> 00:57:24.581
[rooster crows]

1242
00:57:24.616 --> 00:57:26.781
[chickens clucking]
[dogs barking in distance]

1243
00:57:32.250 --> 00:57:34.118
[rooster crows]

1244
00:57:34.824 --> 00:57:36.120
[groaning]

1245
00:57:40.489 --> 00:57:42.126
[grunts. sniffles]

1246
00:57:42.161 --> 00:57:43.325
[groans]

1247
00:57:45.098 --> 00:57:46.328
What the fuck?

1248
00:57:48.805 --> 00:57:51.201
What the fuck! Are you...
[clucking]

1249
00:57:51.236 --> 00:57:53.610
[breathing heavily]

1250
00:57:53.645 --> 00:57:55.205
Okay.

1251
00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:57.174
There's a chicken in my bed.

1252
00:57:59.013 --> 00:58:01.310
[laughing]
There was a chicken in my bed.

1253
00:58:01.345 --> 00:58:03.444
[Shelly] Speak of the devil.

1254
00:58:03.479 --> 00:58:06.282
Well. if he's a devil.
then sign me up for hell.
you know what I mean?

1255
00:58:06.317 --> 00:58:08.020
Where's Bob?
Where's Bender?

1256
00:58:08.055 --> 00:58:09.384
Where the fuck are we?

1257
00:58:09.419 --> 00:58:11.628
Remember. you're
at the Panty Hamster.

1258
00:58:11.663 --> 00:58:15.863
We like to think
it marries old-world charm
with modern conveniences.

1259
00:58:15.898 --> 00:58:18.228
Sit down now.
I'll get you a plate.

1260
00:58:19.297 --> 00:58:20.329
You earned it.

1261
00:58:20.364 --> 00:58:21.330
Oh. hell. yeah.

1262
00:58:22.674 --> 00:58:24.531
Please tell me
I didn't fuck a chicken.

1263
00:58:24.566 --> 00:58:25.939
Oh. you don't remember?

1264
00:58:25.974 --> 00:58:27.402
I don't remember shit
from last night.

1265
00:58:27.437 --> 00:58:28.876
Oh. man.
how's your jaw?

1266
00:58:28.911 --> 00:58:30.581
I think it was. um.

1267
00:58:30.616 --> 00:58:33.045
"The bigger the FUPA.
the sweeter the chalupa.
Shelly."

1268
00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:34.684
That's what you kept sayin'
last night.

1269
00:58:36.886 --> 00:58:38.853
No.
You were all smiles.

1270
00:58:38.888 --> 00:58:41.152
There you go. big guy.
[chuckles]

1271
00:58:42.122 --> 00:58:43.825
Maybe you're not hungry.

1272
00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:45.827
After all. you got
a belly full of pussy.

1273
00:58:45.862 --> 00:58:47.928
[laughing]

1274
00:58:47.963 --> 00:58:51.063
You know.
most men don't like to
kiss a Wookiee that much.

1275
00:58:51.098 --> 00:58:53.769
but like I was tellin'
your friend here.

1276
00:58:53.804 --> 00:58:56.563
you were like
Pac-Man down there.

1277
00:58:56.598 --> 00:58:59.709
[imitating Pac-Man. laughing]

1278
00:59:01.911 --> 00:59:04.912
[Shelly] Eat your eggs. man.
They're gonna get
cold and slimy.

1279
00:59:04.947 --> 00:59:06.342
[clucking]

1280
00:59:07.477 --> 00:59:09.378
Oh. now you don't wanna eat?

1281
00:59:11.756 --> 00:59:14.548
[grunts] Come on.

1282
00:59:14.583 --> 00:59:16.022
[breathing heavily]

1283
00:59:20.292 --> 00:59:23.964
How does
such a high-tech house
have no service?

1284
00:59:32.007 --> 00:59:33.369
Hey.

1285
00:59:33.404 --> 00:59:35.646
Hey. come on. You okay?

1286
00:59:35.681 --> 00:59:37.439
Amazing.

1287
00:59:37.474 --> 00:59:40.145
Hey. hey. hey.
[shouts] Oh.

1288
00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:42.818
Come on. Come on.
Oh. shit.

1289
00:59:42.853 --> 00:59:44.116
[gong chimes]

1290
00:59:44.151 --> 00:59:45.315
Come!

1291
00:59:46.857 --> 00:59:47.922
Come!

1292
00:59:48.452 --> 00:59:49.825
[hissing]

1293
00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:51.255
Come on.
Come on. come here.

1294
00:59:58.429 --> 01:00:00.737
Just in time for the wokening.

1295
01:00:01.597 --> 01:00:03.267
I knew you'd find your own way.

1296
01:00:03.302 --> 01:00:06.908
Yeah. uh. we're actually
looking for our friends.

1297
01:00:06.943 --> 01:00:09.845
Maybe you could give us
a drive into town. or--
or I don't know.

1298
01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:11.275
Point us
in the right direction?

1299
01:00:11.310 --> 01:00:13.541
Soon. my antique warriors.

1300
01:00:13.576 --> 01:00:16.918
Everything comes in time.
but right now
is the time to evolve.

1301
01:00:17.822 --> 01:00:18.854
You'll see.

1302
01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:22.583
I don't wanna evolve.
I wanna go home.

1303
01:00:24.488 --> 01:00:26.928
Yo. Doc and Shelly
are probably down there.
We should just go.

1304
01:00:26.963 --> 01:00:29.194
You think?
Okay. let's go.

1305
01:00:30.329 --> 01:00:31.361
Yeah.

1306
01:00:31.968 --> 01:00:33.297
What?

1307
01:00:33.332 --> 01:00:35.805
You're fuckin'...
What are you...

1308
01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:41.745
[muffled thumping. moaning]

1309
01:00:47.049 --> 01:00:49.148
Finish already.

1310
01:00:51.889 --> 01:00:52.954
Geez.

1311
01:00:52.989 --> 01:00:54.483
[chicken clucking]

1312
01:00:54.518 --> 01:00:56.958
That's weird.
Come on. get. Get.

1313
01:00:56.993 --> 01:00:58.652
Chick digs you. buddy.

1314
01:00:58.687 --> 01:01:01.259
Did you even call Bob
and see if he could
come get us?

1315
01:01:01.294 --> 01:01:03.492
I called both of them.
Went straight to voice mail.

1316
01:01:03.527 --> 01:01:05.098
[sighs]

1317
01:01:05.133 --> 01:01:06.869
[door closes]
How'd they--

1318
01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:09.872
You okay?

1319
01:01:09.907 --> 01:01:11.368
Yeah. I'm fine.

1320
01:01:18.850 --> 01:01:21.345
[farting.
feces splattering]
Oh!

1321
01:01:24.548 --> 01:01:25.580
Okay.

1322
01:01:27.353 --> 01:01:28.990
Zane.

1323
01:01:29.025 --> 01:01:30.893
What is Zane
gonna possibly do?

1324
01:01:30.928 --> 01:01:32.862
Nothin'. But he's
gonna love this story.
[phone rings]

1325
01:01:32.897 --> 01:01:34.226
Shelly!

1326
01:01:34.261 --> 01:01:36.525
Oh. thank God.
What happened to your nose?

1327
01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:39.000
Are you guys okay?
I've been worried sick
about you.

1328
01:01:39.035 --> 01:01:41.233
[Shelly]<i> Hey. buddy.</i>
<i>it's just me and Doc now.</i>

1329
01:01:41.268 --> 01:01:44.533
<i>Listen. we were stayin'</i>
<i>at this seedy little Airbnb</i>
<i>last night.</i>

1330
01:01:44.568 --> 01:01:47.008
<i>and Doc had his face full of--</i>
<i>Give me that thing.</i>

1331
01:01:47.043 --> 01:01:49.241
<i>Hey. buddy. have you heard</i>
<i>from Bob or Bender?</i>

1332
01:01:49.276 --> 01:01:51.947
No. I haven't.
I keep calling.
and I just get voice mail.

1333
01:01:51.982 --> 01:01:54.378
[banging on door]
[Jack] Zane?

1334
01:01:54.413 --> 01:01:56.017
Open up the door.
Oh. my God.

1335
01:01:56.712 --> 01:01:58.019
Oh. my God. you guys.

1336
01:01:58.054 --> 01:02:00.252
<i>They found me. Right now.</i>

1337
01:02:00.287 --> 01:02:03.156
<i>And they sound so. so angry.</i>
<i>What do I do?</i>

1338
01:02:03.191 --> 01:02:05.752
Hide. hide.
Don't make any noise.
Get down somewhere and hide.

1339
01:02:05.787 --> 01:02:07.897
[Jack] I'm not fucking around...

1666
01:16:47.305 --> 01:16:49.943
And-- [groaning]

1667
01:16:51.474 --> 01:16:53.573
You all right?

1668
01:16:53.608 --> 01:16:55.311
It's the first one. right?

1669
01:16:55.346 --> 01:16:58.083
The chick with the body hair
turned her armpits into vaginas

1670
01:16:58.118 --> 01:16:59.821
to give her more powers
as a woman!

1671
01:16:59.856 --> 01:17:02.054
No. no.
Ow! [groans]

1672
01:17:02.089 --> 01:17:04.122
Yeah. you kinda
deserved that one.

1673

[Phoenix]
<i>Wrong. They are both examples</i>

1674
01:17:07.424 --> 01:17:08.731
So we were both right!

1675
01:17:08.766 --> 01:17:10.832
[Phoenix]
<i>No. Both wrong.</i>

1676
01:17:10.867 --> 01:17:13.593
<i>Next one.</i>
<i>What is wrong with this image?</i>

1677
01:17:14.596 --> 01:17:15.969
[Bob] Uh...

1678
01:17:17.401 --> 01:17:21.172
Gender reveal parties
are bad for the environment.

1679
01:17:22.274 --> 01:17:24.846
Turtles and baby seals
and shit will eat that.

1680
01:17:24.881 --> 01:17:27.783
Yeah. that's good.
You shouldn't brag
about having kids online

1681
01:17:27.818 --> 01:17:29.312
because some people
can't have kids.

1682
01:17:29.347 --> 01:17:30.786
Yes.
Yes.

1683
01:17:30.821 --> 01:17:31.919

1688
01:17:40.193 --> 01:17:41.995
Oh. my God.
Three?

1689
01:17:45.330 --> 01:17:47.836
Okay. all right. Here it is.
We're gettin' out of here.

1690
01:17:47.871 --> 01:17:52.434
The parents.
they shouldn't decide
their boy or girlness.

1691
01:17:52.469 --> 01:17:53.776
or whatever it's called.

1692
01:17:53.811 --> 01:17:56.944
the gender re-- re--
ration. or whatever.

1693
01:17:56.979 --> 01:17:59.177
The kids should decide
their own gender.

1694
01:17:59.212 --> 01:18:01.047
What? Nah.
[groans]

1695

1696
01:18:03.744 --> 01:18:05.447
Yeah.
I know I was right!

1697
01:18:05.482 --> 01:18:07.680
You don't cancel me.
I cancel you!

1698
01:18:07.715 --> 01:18:08.758

1699
01:18:08.793 --> 01:18:11.552
Again! Again!

1700
01:18:11.587 --> 01:18:14.225

Oh! [laughs]

1701
01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:16.524

I'm not afraid of you!

1702
01:18:16.559 --> 01:18:17.998

1704
01:18:21.762 --> 01:18:23.333

1706
01:18:31.882 --> 01:18:33.948
Thank you.

1707
01:18:33.983 --> 01:18:36.709
Now take off the straps.
We won. Let us go.

1708
01:18:42.684 --> 01:18:43.892
You didn't win.

1709
01:18:45.291 --> 01:18:46.829
No. we did win.

1710
01:18:46.864 --> 01:18:48.897
We beat the clock.
We beat the game. We won.

1711
01:18:48.932 --> 01:18:50.624

You learned. didn't you?

1713
01:18:53.398 --> 01:18:55.838
Yeah. sure. whatever.
Let us go.

1714
01:18:55.873 --> 01:19:01.305
You see. I've always had
terrible taste in men. Bob.

1715
01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:03.406
No matter how evolved
I've become.

1716
01:19:03.441 --> 01:19:05.474
no matter how peaceful
the community I built was.

1717
01:19:05.509 --> 01:19:08.213
I couldn't help
but be attracted to men
who are less than perfect.

1718
01:19:08.248 --> 01:19:09.775
less than empathetic.

1719
01:19:09.810 --> 01:19:11.887
less than woke.
Ugh.

1720
01:19:11.922 --> 01:19:14.219
Men like you. Bob.
Ah.

1721
01:19:14.254 --> 01:19:16.386
[Phoenix] I always thought
I could change them.

1722
01:19:16.421 --> 01:19:17.750
as I have changed.

1723
01:19:18.489 --> 01:19:20.588
Reborn like the phoenix.

1724
01:19:22.790 --> 01:19:26.165
Tell me.
have I changed you. Bob?

1725
01:19:27.795 --> 01:19:30.169
Yeah.
I'm not sure I'm the one
that has the issues here.

1726
01:19:30.204 --> 01:19:31.797
but yeah. I have. uh--

1727
01:19:31.832 --> 01:19:33.304
I've changed.
I'm way different.
Can we go?

1728
01:19:33.339 --> 01:19:34.338
No.

1729
01:19:36.309 --> 01:19:39.112
You like to play games.
isn't that right. Bobfather?

1730
01:19:39.147 --> 01:19:40.344
Yeah. I do.

1731
01:19:41.611 --> 01:19:43.182
And in my heart of hearts.

1732
01:19:44.020 --> 01:19:46.053
I like them too.

1733
01:19:46.088 --> 01:19:47.747
Now. come on.

1734

Ugh.

1738
01:19:57.792 --> 01:20:02.234
Up until this point.
we've played children's games.

1739
01:20:02.269 --> 01:20:04.467
It's now time
to play something real.

1740
01:20:05.701 --> 01:20:07.107
Something with stakes.

1741

supposed to mean?

1742

Oh. my God.

1743
01:20:09.804 --> 01:20:11.606
Holy shit.

1744
01:20:11.641 --> 01:20:13.883
A game originated
with a czarist.
Put the fucking gun away.

1745
01:20:13.918 --> 01:20:19.449
It was a game intended
as the ultimate test
of bravery and will.

Oh. my God.
You are out of your mind.

I am not gonna do that.

1754

But you do!

The Japanese samurai
lived life by the Bushido.

1757

of dying or living as though
one was already dead.

He talked about you
for years.

1842
01:24:39.007 --> 01:24:42.250
And we all felt
that it was right that--

1843
01:24:42.285 --> 01:24:45.319
Well. we track you down
and let you know what happened.

1844
01:24:47.521 --> 01:24:48.850
I loved him.

1845
01:24:51.294 --> 01:24:53.459
And I often thought
about trying to find him.

1846
01:24:53.494 --> 01:24:55.593

he felt the same way.

I'm so sorry. my love.

1875
01:26:07.832 --> 01:26:09.535
They actually
tracked us down here

1876
01:26:09.570 --> 01:26:12.065
to give us some very sad news
about your father.

1877

what's happening?

Jack.
he described you so clearly.
I remember it even now.

1879
01:26:24.684 --> 01:26:28.455
The intensity.
the protectiveness.

1880
01:26:28.490 --> 01:26:31.150
He said you were
a very good brother.
Really?

1881

I made up that last part.

1882
01:26:32.857 --> 01:26:35.022
You know. I only spent
a very short time with Durfy.

1883
01:26:35.057 --> 01:26:38.025
but it was full
of so much passion and love.

1884
01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:41.160

be so grateful

1885

he should stay with you.

And then
when the time's right.
maybe we could--
