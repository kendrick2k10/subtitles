Bonjour.

9
00:00:53.458 --> 00:00:57.666
Once upon a time
in a magical kingdom called Andalasia.

10
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.291
a baby was found in the forest.

11
00:01:01.083 --> 00:01:03.375
With no mother or father to speak of.

12
00:01:03.458 --> 00:01:08.583
the baby was raised by the animals.
who loved her as one of their own.

13
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:11.958
-And her name was Giselle.

14
00:01:13.041 --> 00:01:15.916
Giselle grew into a beautiful young lady…

15
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.166
{\an8}with a loving heart and a secret desire.

16
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.583

A true love's kiss ♪

18
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:32.958
Until one day. she won the love
of Andalasia's bravest prince!

19
00:01:33.458 --> 00:01:39.250
{\an8}But then. Giselle was pushed
through a portal by an Evil Queen

20
00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:43.583
and landed in a strange
and extremely confusing kingdom called…

21
00:01:44.291 --> 00:01:47.625
♪ New York City
New York City ♪

22
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.375
There she met Robert.
who was a lawyer with dreamy eyes

23
00:01:52.458 --> 00:01:57.083
and a daughter named Morgan.
who saw magic everywhere she went.

24
00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:59.583
So Giselle and Robert fell in love.

25
00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:00.666
And they lived…

26
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.041
♪ Ever. ever after ♪

27
00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:09.250
-Dad. Dad!

28
00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:12.125
-Come on! Read it again. Dad.
-Get over here!

29
00:02:12.208 --> 00:02:16.875
What if I told you that "ever after"
wasn't the end of their story?

30
00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.000
-Oh!

31
00:02:18.083 --> 00:02:20.083
We've heard this story a million times.

32
00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:21.875
That's how it always ends.

33
00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.041
Uh. uh. uh.
You only heard part of the story.

34
00:02:25.041 --> 00:02:27.916
See. it turns out. New York wasn't
Giselle's happily-ever-after after all.

35
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.041
-Huh?
-What? Huh?

36
00:02:29.125 --> 00:02:31.625
Well. I'm not too proud
of my part in this one.

37
00:02:31.708 --> 00:02:33.875
but if you two will get into bed.
I'll read it to ya.

38
00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:38.166
This story begins
where the old one left off:

39
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.916
in the kingdom of New York
after "happily ever after."

40
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.791
After? But there is no after.
after "happily ever after."

41
00:02:45.875 --> 00:02:51.250
Yeah. You just get married
then nothing ever happens to you again.

42
00:02:51.333 --> 00:02:53.166
Oh. not in this world.

43
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.791
Over there.
things would never stop happening.

44
00:02:55.875 --> 00:02:58.166
For Giselle. a few years went by.

45
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.875
Morgan sprouted up. and eventually.
Robert and Giselle had a baby.

46
00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.583
A beautiful girl named Sofia.

47
00:03:05.666 --> 00:03:08.916
And for one moment.
Giselle truly had it all.

48
00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.375
And that's when things began to change.

49
00:03:13.916 --> 00:03:18.416
{\an8}First. with all the baby stuff.
their castle in the sky shrunk two sizes.

50
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.375
Then. life got so busy.

51
00:03:20.458 --> 00:03:23.833
it felt like a sleeping curse
fell over them every single night.

52
00:03:24.416 --> 00:03:27.166
But the hardest part of all was Morgan.

53
00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:31.791
She became what that world calls
a "teenager."

54
00:03:32.541 --> 00:03:36.041
And it felt to Giselle
that she had set out to a faraway place

55
00:03:36.125 --> 00:03:37.750
where she could never go.

56
00:03:38.375 --> 00:03:41.041
With so much change.
Giselle started feeling

57
00:03:41.125 --> 00:03:45.000
{\an8}that life in the kingdom of New York
wasn't such a fairy tale after all.

58
00:03:46.291 --> 00:03:49.583
And that's when she saw… a sign.

59
00:03:49.666 --> 00:03:51.375
{\an8}And. suddenly. she realized

60
00:03:51.458 --> 00:03:54.458
{\an8}their happily-ever-after
might be somewhere else.

61
00:03:55.125 --> 00:03:59.541
So. Giselle and Robert began their quest
for a new happily-ever-after.

62
00:04:05.875 --> 00:04:08.375
All right. Next stop: "Monroeville."

63
00:04:08.458 --> 00:04:10.000
Where the hell's Monroeville?

64
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
I don't know.

65
00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.625
It's got to be better than here.

66
00:04:18.666 --> 00:04:23.166
I know that change can be scary.
but it can also be exciting.

67
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.083
Think of all of the wonderful new people
you're going to meet

68
00:04:26.166 --> 00:04:28.583
who will love you just as much as I do.

69
00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:32.958
And remember.
whenever you need a friend. what do we do?

70
00:04:56.916 --> 00:04:59.791
-Morgan. can you try and help out here?

71
00:04:59.875 --> 00:05:03.125
I am helping. I'm literally telling
the entire Internet about my kidnapping.

72
00:05:03.208 --> 00:05:04.583
Everyone agrees it's a tragedy.

73
00:05:04.666 --> 00:05:07.291
You know. a lot of people move
to the suburbs from the city.

74
00:05:07.375 --> 00:05:08.833
and they're wildly happy.

75
00:05:08.916 --> 00:05:11.416
Yeah. well. I was wildly happy here.

76
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.083
Can you back me up on this. Sofia?

77
00:05:14.583 --> 00:05:15.875
You are no help.

78
00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.333
So. who's excited for our new adventure?

79
00:05:18.416 --> 00:05:19.791
-Very excited.

80
00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:24.000
-Oh. that's… sarcasm.
-Sarcasm. yeah.

81
00:05:24.583 --> 00:05:29.000
But. Morgan. I promise.
Monroeville is the perfect place.

82
00:05:29.083 --> 00:05:31.791
Perfect for you. maybe.
Not so much for me.

83
00:05:32.541 --> 00:05:35.000
-Morgan--
-Ah. ah. ah. No speeches.

84
00:05:35.083 --> 00:05:37.083
If we're gonna do this. let's just go.

85
00:05:38.708 --> 00:05:40.875
Teenagers are like this. She'll be fine.

86
00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:44.000
I hope so.

87
00:05:44.875 --> 00:05:47.458
We really did have magic memories here.
didn't we?

88
00:05:47.541 --> 00:05:49.250
We did. And we'll have more.

89
00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:53.583
Trust me. if I learned anything
from meeting a princess on a billboard.

90
00:05:53.666 --> 00:05:56.291
it's that sometimes
you just have to take a leap.

91
00:05:57.375 --> 00:05:58.208
Hmm.

92
00:05:59.041 --> 00:06:01.375
Let's start our new life.

93
00:06:07.208 --> 00:06:10.125
And so they packed up and moved…

00:06:32.833 --> 00:06:36.041
It's the closest thing to Andalasia
I've ever seen.

100
00:06:36.125 --> 00:06:38.083
-Our house is like a castle.

101
00:06:38.166 --> 00:06:39.166
I'll have my own room.

102
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.791
You've told me a million times.

103
00:06:42.458 --> 00:06:44.000
-Hey. look.

104
00:06:44.083 --> 00:06:45.708
Mm-hmm.

105
00:06:45.791 --> 00:06:47.375
Well. you never know. Morgan.

106
00:06:47.458 --> 00:06:51.166
Maybe Monroeville will give you
a little magic like I had growing up.

107
00:06:51.916 --> 00:06:52.750
Hmm.

108
00:06:55.875 --> 00:06:56.875
Here it is.

109
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.958
Oh. good. The walls are back up.

110
00:07:01.041 --> 00:07:02.500
The walls were down?

111
00:07:04.708 --> 00:07:06.750
-Oh.
-Oh. boy.

112
00:07:06.833 --> 00:07:09.250
Wow. Interesting castle.

113
00:07:09.333 --> 00:07:12.583
We're running a little behind schedule.
so you just have to have vision.

114
00:07:12.666 --> 00:07:14.333
A new baby in town.

115
00:07:14.416 --> 00:07:16.541
-We would've brought gifts.
-Oh.

116
00:07:16.625 --> 00:07:18.541
We're great with naps.
if you ever need help.

117
00:07:18.625 --> 00:07:19.708
Oh. my. Thank you.

118
00:07:19.791 --> 00:07:21.750
-I might take you up on that.
-Mmm.

119
00:07:21.833 --> 00:07:24.166
-Oh. should we go check out our new home?
-Yeah.

120
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.375
It's all part of the adventure.

121
00:07:26.458 --> 00:07:27.458
Bye.

122
00:07:30.791 --> 00:07:33.375
-That goes in the living room. Thanks.

123
00:07:35.416 --> 00:07:38.208
Yeah. that's not an adventure.
That's a landfill.

124
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.541
-A land filled with adventure.

125
00:07:42.625 --> 00:07:46.166
Here. let me take my little princess
and show you the rest of the house.

126
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.916
-Yes. It's okay. Off we go.

127
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.125
I am going to go see if one of those
movers will move me back to New York.

128
00:07:56.708 --> 00:07:59.375
I know it's hard to start over
someplace new.

129
00:07:59.875 --> 00:08:01.250
I did it once.

130
00:08:01.333 --> 00:08:02.958
Not really on purpose.

131
00:08:03.541 --> 00:08:07.125
but I found that you just have to
look at things the right way.

132
00:08:07.208 --> 00:08:08.333
Oh. no.

133
00:08:09.041 --> 00:08:10.458

00:10:28.875 --> 00:10:29.875
Wow.

174
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.000
I know I got carried away.
and you can change anything.

175
00:10:37.083 --> 00:10:40.041
I just wanted you to have a real room
when you got here.

176
00:10:42.291 --> 00:10:44.875
Yeah. She made them promise
that it would be done.

177
00:10:49.083 --> 00:10:50.416
It's beautiful. Mom.

178
00:10:51.458 --> 00:10:52.458
Really?

179
00:10:55.708 --> 00:10:58.083
Oh. pretty soon.
this whole place will feel like home.

180
00:10:58.166 --> 00:11:00.083
You'll see. You'll see.

181
00:11:00.583 --> 00:11:01.583
-Uh. yeah.
-Yeah.

182
00:11:02.791 --> 00:11:05.166
-Good job. honey. Good job. Good job.
-Mmm.

183
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.125
-Oh. no. no. no. no. no. no. no.

184
00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:13.708
-Oh. my--
-Shut it off!

185
00:11:13.791 --> 00:11:16.333
-That's my stuff! Oh. help!
-Smother the flame!

186
00:11:16.416 --> 00:11:17.750
-What--
-Grab a blanket!

187
00:11:17.833 --> 00:11:19.625

-I can't--

189
00:11:20.791 --> 00:11:22.583

Hello. hello!

191
00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.166
Do we know somebody?

192
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:29.041
No. But we can.

193
00:11:30.166 --> 00:11:33.083
What are you? Color-blind?
That's not green. That's aqua.

194
00:11:33.916 --> 00:11:35.583
-What are they? Fish?

195
00:11:35.666 --> 00:11:37.166
-Oh.
-Oh.

196
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:39.541
Hope you don't mind. Door was open.

197
00:11:39.625 --> 00:11:42.208
-Giselle and Robert. right? And Morgan.
-Oh. Yeah.

198
00:11:42.291 --> 00:11:44.833
-Oh. and little Sofia.

199
00:11:44.916 --> 00:11:47.125
-Why. yes. How did you know?
-Hi.

200
00:11:47.208 --> 00:11:49.375
Malvina Monroe.

201
00:11:49.458 --> 00:11:51.708
-Oh.
-I would've sold you this house.

202
00:11:51.791 --> 00:11:55.541
but I deal in slightly more
upscale homes. so…

203
00:11:55.625 --> 00:11:56.833
Mm-hmm.

204
00:11:56.916 --> 00:11:58.791
-Rosaleen and Ruby!

205
00:11:58.875 --> 00:12:00.958
Oh. they smell so good.

206
00:12:01.041 --> 00:12:03.375
-Oh.
-Oh! Wow.

207
00:12:03.458 --> 00:12:05.875
-Giselle.
-It's really something.

208
00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.333
She made it all herself.

209
00:12:07.416 --> 00:12:08.666
Even the baskets.

210
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:10.041
-Really?

211
00:12:11.208 --> 00:12:12.291
I weave.

212
00:12:12.375 --> 00:12:14.500
Well. that's very nice of you.

213
00:12:14.583 --> 00:12:15.916
And a little weird.

214
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.833
Morgan.
why don't we take these into the kitchen?

215
00:12:18.916 --> 00:12:20.416
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

216
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.458
-Nice to meet you.
-We'll just get right--

217
00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:23.625
Bye now.

218
00:12:23.708 --> 00:12:25.500
I have one that age too.

219
00:12:25.583 --> 00:12:27.833
-So pouty.
-Oh.

220
00:12:27.916 --> 00:12:29.416
But he's still the apple of my eye.

221
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:31.375
-Of everyone's eye.

222
00:12:31.458 --> 00:12:34.208
More like the apple
of everybody's whole face.

223
00:12:35.125 --> 00:12:36.708
Oh--

224
00:12:36.791 --> 00:12:40.833
Now. if you all need anything.
I'm your gal. all right?

225
00:12:40.916 --> 00:12:43.125
-Oh. Mm-hmm.
-I know this town better than anyone else.

226
00:12:43.208 --> 00:12:46.125
So modest. She made this town what it is.

227
00:12:46.208 --> 00:12:48.291
Oh. yeah. She's like a queen around here.

228
00:12:48.375 --> 00:12:52.125
Oh. Well. then I'm doubly honored.

229
00:12:52.208 --> 00:12:55.041
I think that every town
should have a queen. so…

230
00:12:55.708 --> 00:12:56.708
Yeah.

231
00:12:57.375 --> 00:12:58.375
Good night.

232
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.250
Well. that wasn't exactly
the first day we'd hoped for. but…

233
00:13:04.916 --> 00:13:06.833
Maybe we should've waited another month.

234
00:13:06.916 --> 00:13:10.250
No. we pushed it three times.
Don't worry. We'll settle in.

235
00:13:10.333 --> 00:13:11.666
-Listen to that.

236
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.541
-That is so much better than 5th Avenue.

237
00:13:14.625 --> 00:13:16.833
Mmm. no. that's just weirdly louder.

238
00:13:16.916 --> 00:13:19.916
Those crickets composed that song
just for us to say.

239
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.208
-"Hello."

240
00:13:21.291 --> 00:13:23.541
As a thank-you.
we should build 'em a resort.

241
00:13:23.625 --> 00:13:25.583
-I don't think they have one of those.

242
00:13:25.666 --> 00:13:28.666
Can we just talk about the fact that
we moved out here to get more space.

243
00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:30.625
and now we're just
sleeping in the same room?

244
00:13:30.708 --> 00:13:32.958
-I know.
-Morgan. we talked about this.

245
00:13:33.041 --> 00:13:35.166
It's just until the smoke
clears your room.

246
00:13:35.791 --> 00:13:37.791
Yeah.

bathed in the light of a forgiving moon…

Oh. no. I don't have a sword.

295
00:16:01.708 --> 00:16:03.833
Oh. I just assumed that.
now that you are a country squire.

296
00:16:03.916 --> 00:16:06.041
-you'd have more need of a sword.
-No. still a lawyer.

297
00:16:06.125 --> 00:16:07.125
Ah. tragic.

-I do a lot.
-Yes. of course.

300

A brave front is required
to face a life as barren as this.

301

Perhaps this will help.

302
00:16:19.791 --> 00:16:20.791
-It's yours.
-Oh. no!

303
00:16:20.875 --> 00:16:22.250

00:18:38.041 --> 00:18:40.541
♪ And if she has questions
Just consult this scroll ♪

347
00:18:41.125 --> 00:18:42.916
The scroll? Oh.

348
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.541
You just ask the scroll any questions.
and the answers appear.

349
00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:48.916
Or I suppose. in this land.
you just read it?

350
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.041
How do you live in this place?

351
00:18:52.125 --> 00:18:55.125
-Oh. How about that?

352
00:18:55.208 --> 00:18:57.791
You're a true daughter of Andalasia.

353
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Hmm?

354
00:19:04.666 --> 00:19:09.000
Okay. well. uh. if you don't have a wand
for a fake daughter of Andalasia.

355
00:19:09.083 --> 00:19:11.166
-I'm gonna go change.
-Oh--

356
00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:12.958
And yes. I will look in your closet.

357
00:19:13.041 --> 00:19:15.291
I'm sure there are lots
of fun options in there

358
00:19:15.375 --> 00:19:18.208
for making a real splash at my new school.

359
00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:19.833
Yes.

360
00:19:20.625 --> 00:19:24.458
She sometimes says one thing
and means the opposite.

361
00:19:24.541 --> 00:19:26.416
-Huh?
-I can never tell.

362
00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.291
-It's-- Yeah.

363
00:19:28.375 --> 00:19:30.708
Yeah. well. that's teenagers for you.

364
00:19:31.958 --> 00:19:33.000
Are you okay?

365
00:19:33.083 --> 00:19:34.958
-Oh. yes. It's fine.
-Hmm…

366
00:19:35.916 --> 00:19:36.916
I just--

367
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.375
Hmm?

368
00:19:38.458 --> 00:19:42.750
Is it sometimes easier
to live in Andalasia?

369
00:19:45.208 --> 00:19:46.208
Oh.

370
00:19:46.291 --> 00:19:48.583
Well. I wouldn't say easier.

371
00:19:49.208 --> 00:19:52.583
-We have dragons and ogre rebellions.

372
00:19:52.666 --> 00:19:56.625
See. in Andalasia the hardest part of life
is finding your happily-ever-after.

373
00:19:57.375 --> 00:20:00.458
-Everything else seems easy.
-Mm-hmm.

374
00:20:00.541 --> 00:20:03.250
This world is-- feels very different.

375
00:20:03.333 --> 00:20:04.583
Yeah. It's true.

376
00:20:04.666 --> 00:20:08.625
Happily ever after is more
of a concept here than it is a thing.

377
00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:11.625
Really? How horribly bleak.

378
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:17.666
Well. I say. that if this world is not
to your liking. then you must change it.

379
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:19.291
Well. honey. it's not always that easy.

380
00:20:19.375 --> 00:20:20.916
Hogwashery!

381
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.416
If anyone can make something out of this.
why. it's our Giselle.

382
00:20:35.958 --> 00:20:36.958
Made it.

383
00:20:37.041 --> 00:20:38.458
Is that a sword?

384
00:20:39.291 --> 00:20:40.458
Yeah. Yeah. it is.

385
00:20:41.458 --> 00:20:42.458
Hmm.

386
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:51.791
Little tip: You should tell 'em.
"no bag. double wrapped."

387
00:20:51.875 --> 00:20:55.000
And maybe leave the sword
at home next time.

388
00:20:55.083 --> 00:20:57.083
-Don't listen to him.

389
00:20:57.166 --> 00:20:58.166
You gotta do you.

390
00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:00.833
After all.
you're riding this train over and over.

391
00:21:00.916 --> 00:21:06.500
And over and over.
And over and over. And over and over.

392
00:21:06.583 --> 00:21:08.041
And then you die.

393
00:21:08.958 --> 00:21:10.458
It's just reality. man.

394
00:21:10.541 --> 00:21:12.750
Metro North to Grand Central Station.

395
00:21:12.833 --> 00:21:14.041
Next stop. Poughkeepsie.

396
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.833
Oh. I gotta go in!
Save me a seat!

397
00:21:21.125 --> 00:21:23.958
I feel like a human get-well bouquet.

398
00:21:24.041 --> 00:21:26.958
Don't be silly.
You look beautiful.

399
00:21:27.041 --> 00:21:30.791
The flowers on your skirt bring out
the rest of the flowers on your skirt.

400
00:21:30.875 --> 00:21:31.875
-Oh. great.

401
00:21:33.083 --> 00:21:34.791
-Oh. my.
-Very nice!

402
00:21:34.875 --> 00:21:36.958
This is a big improvement from last year.

403
00:21:37.041 --> 00:21:39.041
She really is involved.

404
00:21:39.125 --> 00:21:42.458
-Congrats. you made it!
-Thank you.

405
00:21:42.541 --> 00:21:46.583
Wow. You really do have a talent
for baked goods.

406
00:21:46.666 --> 00:21:49.666
-It's just a little fundraiser.
-For. um. Monroe-fest? What's that?

407
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:53.625
It's the biggest event of the year.
Malvina organizes the whole thing.

408
00:21:53.708 --> 00:21:55.166
-It's spectacular.
-Mmm?

409
00:21:55.250 --> 00:22:00.083
There's also games and a little fun vote
for prince and princess.

410
00:22:00.166 --> 00:22:02.833
{\an8}Her son Tyson's won prince
three years in a row.

411
00:22:02.916 --> 00:22:05.291
Even when he broke both his legs.
he still won.

412
00:22:05.375 --> 00:22:07.666
-It's not rigged. I promise.
-Mm-mmm.

413
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:09.500
I think it sounds wonderful.

414
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.916
I love festivals. We have them
all the time where I come from.

415
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000
-Mmm.
-Ah!

416
00:22:14.083 --> 00:22:16.541
They were usually interrupted
by evil forces of some kind.

417
00:22:16.625 --> 00:22:19.708
but when they weren't.
it really brought people together.

418
00:22:19.791 --> 00:22:22.583
-Aha.
-I would love to help if you need it.

419
00:22:22.666 --> 00:22:24.791
You actually should take her up on that.

420
00:22:24.875 --> 00:22:27.125
This one time she made a forest
entirely out of M&M's

421
00:22:27.208 --> 00:22:28.916
and had it delivered
to my class by pigeon.

422
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.541
-That's right.
-Yeah.

423
00:22:30.625 --> 00:22:32.541
No one beats her at this kind of stuff.

424
00:22:32.625 --> 00:22:35.583
-Huh? Is that so?

425
00:22:36.666 --> 00:22:38.958
Well. here we go.

426
00:22:39.041 --> 00:22:42.250
Morgan? You're gonna be great.

427
00:22:44.041 --> 00:22:45.333
Thank you.

428
00:22:46.666 --> 00:22:48.458
-Hmm.
-Tee-hee-hee.

429
00:22:50.458 --> 00:22:53.875
♪ Just believe in yourself! ♪

430
00:22:53.958 --> 00:22:56.833
-What? Wait. What was that?

431
00:23:00.166 --> 00:23:05.708
You know. Giselle. if you have time.
I'd love to buy you a coffee

432
00:23:05.791 --> 00:23:10.000
-and hear more about your M&M masterpiece…
-Oh.

433
00:23:10.083 --> 00:23:13.833
…and whatever else there is
to know about our newest Monrovians.

434
00:23:14.416 --> 00:23:17.458
That would be so nice. Thank you.

435
00:23:18.583 --> 00:23:19.791
Hey.

436
00:23:19.875 --> 00:23:23.083
-Excuse you!
-I'm living the full cliché here.

437
00:23:24.291 --> 00:23:26.708
They must have an urgent selfie to post.

438
00:23:26.791 --> 00:23:27.833
Hmm.

439
00:23:28.333 --> 00:23:29.875
Hey. you're the new girl from New York.

440
00:23:29.958 --> 00:23:34.583
Uh. Morgan.
And you're Tyson from cupcakes.

441
00:23:34.666 --> 00:23:36.125
Ah. you met my mother.

442
00:23:36.208 --> 00:23:38.625
Yeah.
I just try to ignore whatever she's doing.

443
00:23:38.708 --> 00:23:40.458
She gets kind of intense.

444
00:23:40.541 --> 00:23:43.583
Yeah. well. imagine if she was made
of magic and sang at the drive-through.

445
00:23:43.666 --> 00:23:44.625
Huh.

446
00:23:44.708 --> 00:23:45.708
-Yeah.

447
00:23:45.791 --> 00:23:48.250
Tyson! Come on!

448
00:23:48.333 --> 00:23:50.500
-Dipset. bro.
-Let's go. man!

449
00:23:53.375 --> 00:23:55.208
-Ew. Look what she's wearing.
-Whoa.

450
00:23:55.291 --> 00:23:58.125
-Whoa. That's a lot of flowers.
-Like. a lot.

451
00:23:59.916 --> 00:24:03.625
Extra large cappuccino with five shots.

452
00:24:03.708 --> 00:24:04.875
-There it is.
-Hmm.

453
00:24:05.625 --> 00:24:08.333
-Now. let me see…
-Hmm?

454
00:24:08.916 --> 00:24:10.500
-Herbal tea…
-Oh.

455
00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:12.916
Chamomile-- No!

456
00:24:16.666 --> 00:24:17.958
Hibiscus.

457
00:24:18.958 --> 00:24:21.000
You're right. He's right.

458
00:24:21.083 --> 00:24:24.833
Oh. Edgar knows everything.
He's my eyes and ears.

459
00:24:25.625 --> 00:24:26.875
Thank you.

460
00:24:26.958 --> 00:24:29.875
-Oh?
-Wow. you guys move really quickly.

461
00:24:29.958 --> 00:24:31.791
-We go wherever she needs us to be.
-Mm-hmm.

462
00:24:31.875 --> 00:24:36.291
As you can see. Giselle.
our town is really just one big family.

463
00:24:36.375 --> 00:24:39.833
And like a family.
everyone has their place in it.

464
00:24:39.916 --> 00:24:40.916
You know?

465
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.125
And once you've found where you fit.

466
00:24:44.208 --> 00:24:47.166
Monroeville can be whatever you wish.

467
00:24:49.708 --> 00:24:52.625
You know. I think you're right.

468
00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:59.375
Oh. I'm so glad you like it.

469
00:24:59.458 --> 00:25:01.083
Do you think we should add music?

470
00:25:02.083 --> 00:25:04.916
-Oh.

471
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.458
Oh.

472
00:25:06.541 --> 00:25:09.625
Hi. Morgan. How did it go?

473
00:25:09.708 --> 00:25:10.875
It was fine.

474
00:25:25.083 --> 00:25:26.708
Does this mean it didn't go well?

475
00:25:26.791 --> 00:25:30.833
Well. no one talked to me all day.
so I got a lot of me-time. That was nice.

476
00:25:30.916 --> 00:25:31.750
Oh.

477
00:25:31.833 --> 00:25:33.708
Yes. that was sarcasm. My day sucked.

478
00:25:38.458 --> 00:25:41.958
Well. this isn't anything
a little glitter couldn't fix.

479
00:25:42.041 --> 00:25:43.625
It's old anyway. What's the point?

480
00:25:43.708 --> 00:25:48.041
The point is. is that it's a memory tree.
and as we say in Andalasia--

481
00:25:48.125 --> 00:25:51.125
"Memories are the most powerful magic
of all." I know.

482
00:25:51.208 --> 00:25:53.125
I'm not really sure
it works the same way here.

483
00:25:56.541 --> 00:25:58.166
-Morgan.

484
00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:01.833
I know you didn't want to come here.

485
00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:04.791
But if you give it a chance.
it will get better.

486
00:26:04.875 --> 00:26:05.875
What if it doesn't?

487
00:26:05.958 --> 00:26:08.750
I should go back to school in New York.
I can take the train with Dad.

488
00:26:08.833 --> 00:26:11.250
-It'll be fine.
-It's only been a day.

489
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:15.041
We just have to figure out
where you fit in.

490
00:26:15.125 --> 00:26:17.083
We won't do anything. okay?

491
00:26:17.708 --> 00:26:20.541
If I'm gonna do this.
then I have to do it myself. all right?

492
00:26:20.625 --> 00:26:21.500
Okay.

493
00:26:21.583 --> 00:26:23.166
I'm not a little girl anymore.

494
00:26:23.875 --> 00:26:24.875
-I got this.
-Mm-hmm.

495
00:27:06.583 --> 00:27:07.583
-Hmm?

496
00:27:13.583 --> 00:27:16.625
"Meet you at school.
I have a wonderful idea."

497
00:27:17.375 --> 00:27:19.541
This cannot be good.

498
00:27:19.625 --> 00:27:22.750
-And there you go. There you go.

499
00:27:22.833 --> 00:27:25.916
Vote for Morgan. She is new here.

500
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.541
And she makes a great friend.

501
00:27:28.708 --> 00:27:30.791
-Who is Morgan?
-I'm glad you like them.

502
00:27:30.875 --> 00:27:34.458
There you go. Vote for Morgan.

503
00:27:34.541 --> 00:27:35.916
What are you doing?

504
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.791
Oh. well. I was just thinking.

505
00:27:37.875 --> 00:27:40.416
in Andalasia.
we have festivals all the time.

506
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.041
and everybody knows
the prince and the princess.

507
00:27:43.125 --> 00:27:44.375
And now everyone will know you.

508
00:27:44.458 --> 00:27:47.833
Yes. but I told you
that I could figure this out on my own.

509
00:27:49.125 --> 00:27:51.458
Why won't you let me do that?

510
00:27:52.416 --> 00:27:55.541
-Morgan. Morgan.
-Oh.

511
00:27:55.625 --> 00:27:58.416
I'm sorry. Giselle. but you can't have
a table on school property

512
00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.333
unless you're an official member
of a committee.

513
00:28:00.416 --> 00:28:02.500
Oh. well. I'm sorry. I didn't know.

514
00:28:02.583 --> 00:28:04.083
Well. now you do.

515
00:28:04.166 --> 00:28:06.541
-Ladies.
-Gladly.

516
00:28:06.625 --> 00:28:07.750
Excuse me.

517
00:28:08.916 --> 00:28:10.916
-Oh. these cupcakes look incredible!

518
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.375
-Oh.
-Take it all down. All of it.

519
00:28:14.625 --> 00:28:17.083
She's never been this late
without calling.

520
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.583
I think she's turned off her phone.

521
00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:23.000
-That's it. She's grounded.

522
00:28:24.166 --> 00:28:26.333
Do you remember when we made this?

523
00:28:27.833 --> 00:28:31.916
She used to beg me for stories
from Andalasia every night.

524
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.500
and her favorite ones were always
about the Magical Memory Tree.

525
00:28:35.583 --> 00:28:37.416
She used to love those.

526
00:28:38.958 --> 00:28:40.291
I don't know what happened.

527
00:28:40.375 --> 00:28:42.041
Oh. nothing happened.

528
00:28:42.125 --> 00:28:44.666
Teenagers do this all the time.
That's all it is.

529
00:28:45.291 --> 00:28:46.750
It's more than that.

530
00:28:50.541 --> 00:28:52.708
I never sing the right song anymore.

531
00:28:53.291 --> 00:28:56.791
and even when I make cupcakes.
everything goes wrong.

532
00:28:56.875 --> 00:28:58.958
I used to be good at things.

533
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:06.000
Things will get better.
Just give it a second.

534
00:29:08.958 --> 00:29:11.000
Robert. are you happy here?

535
00:29:15.333 --> 00:29:16.333
We just got here.

536
00:29:16.416 --> 00:29:17.708
Hmm.

537
00:29:19.083 --> 00:29:23.083
When is the last time
that you were truly happy?

538
00:29:25.458 --> 00:29:26.583
Uh. well…

539
00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.083
It's not that I'm unhappy.

540
00:29:31.375 --> 00:29:32.833
It just-- Sometimes I wonder if--

541
00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:36.625
if time's just slipping away.

542
00:29:36.708 --> 00:29:42.333
and I'll be riding a train over and over
and over again for the rest of my life.

543
00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.375
-Oh. Morgan.
-What-- Where have you been?

544
00:29:46.541 --> 00:29:48.666
-I went to New York.
-By yourself?

545
00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:52.000
I've been riding the subway alone
since I was 13. Let's calm down. please.

546
00:29:52.083 --> 00:29:54.375
Don't tell me to calm down.

547
00:29:54.458 --> 00:29:56.125
-What were you thinking?
-I don't know. Dad.

548
00:29:56.208 --> 00:29:58.791
I was thinking. though. maybe
you should have left me where I belong.

549
00:29:58.875 --> 00:30:00.166
You belong here.

550
00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:01.708
No. I don't!

551
00:30:01.791 --> 00:30:06.666
Look. I know that you want to live in some
perfect fairy-tale land. but we don't.

552
00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:09.458
-Okay? We live here…
-If you want to be mad. you be mad at me.

553
00:30:09.541 --> 00:30:12.791
-…in this stupid town. and I hate it!
-But do not talk to your mother like that!

554
00:30:12.875 --> 00:30:14.083
My mother?

555
00:30:14.166 --> 00:30:15.083
Mm-hmm.

556
00:30:15.166 --> 00:30:16.500
She is not my mother.

557
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.208
She's my stepmother.

558
00:30:20.208 --> 00:30:22.500
-That's all she'll ever be.

559
00:30:22.583 --> 00:30:23.916
Stepmother?

560
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.416
She didn't mean that.

561
00:30:25.916 --> 00:30:27.958
I think maybe she did.

562
00:30:31.958 --> 00:30:33.875
I can't change that.

00:40:28.208 --> 00:40:30.000
-Yes.

693
00:40:37.375 --> 00:40:38.791
Aah.

694
00:40:38.875 --> 00:40:42.333
And she's a magic queen.
Those are always fun.

695
00:40:42.416 --> 00:40:44.208
Eh. I ain't sure how fun she looks.

696
00:40:44.791 --> 00:40:48.041
Giselle. how lovely to see you.

697
00:40:48.125 --> 00:40:51.166
Out doing some last-minute shopping
for tonight. are we?

698
00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:52.541
What's tonight?

699
00:40:53.583 --> 00:40:54.958
Your Majesty.

700
00:40:55.041 --> 00:40:57.166
For the festival. milady.

701
00:40:57.250 --> 00:40:59.666
Oh. the festival. Is that still happening?

702
00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:01.083
Why wouldn't it?

703
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:04.666
No power on Earth could stop it.

704
00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:09.625
It's my… little gift to my people.

705
00:41:09.708 --> 00:41:10.708
-Oh.

706
00:41:10.791 --> 00:41:14.083
Of course. Your Majesty.

707
00:41:17.041 --> 00:41:19.041
That's an interesting trinket.

708
00:41:19.541 --> 00:41:21.083
Oh. um…

709
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:28.750
Mmm.

710
00:41:32.833 --> 00:41:35.625
Why don't you just focus
on your little party?

711
00:41:35.708 --> 00:41:40.291
After all. baked goods
are what you do best. Your Majesty.

712
00:41:42.208 --> 00:41:43.458
That's wicked.

713
00:41:43.541 --> 00:41:45.291
The wickedest.

714
00:41:45.375 --> 00:41:47.625
Leaping lollipops. what was that?

715
00:41:52.708 --> 00:41:56.708
You know…
…I was just realizing that

716
00:41:56.791 --> 00:42:00.000
this is her very first festival
in Monrolasia.

717
00:42:00.083 --> 00:42:02.041
and we'll need to get you a new dress.
and…

718
00:42:02.125 --> 00:42:04.250
-…well. we better get right on that.
-Huh?

719
00:42:04.333 --> 00:42:06.416
See you tonight. Your Majesty.

720
00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:16.208
Something is going on with her.

721
00:42:16.291 --> 00:42:18.333
And I wanna know what.

722
00:42:21.333 --> 00:42:23.041
-Your Majesty.

723
00:42:24.916 --> 00:42:26.250
Your Majesty.

724
00:42:26.333 --> 00:42:28.708
Everyone. out.

725
00:42:28.791 --> 00:42:29.833
Out. Out.

726
00:42:35.875 --> 00:42:38.333
Mirror. mirror on the wall.

727
00:42:38.416 --> 00:42:43.208
who's the… most powerful of them all?

728
00:42:46.208 --> 00:42:47.208
Mirror?

729
00:42:47.291 --> 00:42:48.541
Nope.

730
00:42:48.625 --> 00:42:49.625
Mirror!

731
00:42:50.458 --> 00:42:52.916
Wha-- Did you not hear the question?

732
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.958
I did. Your Majesty.

733
00:42:55.041 --> 00:42:59.208
I just don't want to end up shattered
on the floor. if I can help it.

734
00:42:59.291 --> 00:43:01.125
Just tell me who it is.

735
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.666
-But it's always you.

736
00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:09.708
Oh. well. he must not understand.

737
00:43:09.791 --> 00:43:13.625
We said most powerful. not the prettiest.

738
00:43:13.708 --> 00:43:15.583
I mean. this guy. huh?

739
00:43:17.083 --> 00:43:19.333
Apologies. Your Majesty.

740
00:43:19.416 --> 00:43:21.916
I just-- I don't know what's happening.

741
00:43:22.625 --> 00:43:23.625
I do.

742
00:43:24.375 --> 00:43:27.833
It's that wand she's been so coy about.

743
00:43:27.916 --> 00:43:31.250
It's dripping with magic.
Even a fool could see it.

744
00:43:31.333 --> 00:43:33.916
-You two. get it for me!
-Hmm.

745
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.208
But-- Wait--

746
00:43:35.291 --> 00:43:36.875
You mean-- You mean steal it?

747
00:43:36.958 --> 00:43:39.458
Uh. yes. Your Majesty.

748
00:43:39.541 --> 00:43:42.208
But-- Ow. ow. ow. ow!

749
00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:52.916
Oh. Giselle. What have you done?

750
00:43:56.583 --> 00:44:00.208
Dresses certainly are different
than when I was almost a princess.

751
00:44:00.791 --> 00:44:01.875
How do I look?

752
00:44:04.583 --> 00:44:07.791
-Oh. Morgan. You look wonderful.

753
00:44:07.875 --> 00:44:09.666
What do you think?

754
00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:12.500
-It's beautiful.
-Then we'll take it.

755
00:44:12.583 --> 00:44:14.250
-You really don't have to do that.

756
00:44:14.333 --> 00:44:15.666
I'm sure it's very expensive.

757
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:16.833
Of course. I do.

758
00:44:16.916 --> 00:44:19.416
I've always dreamed
of sharing a night like this with you.

759
00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:21.958
-and it's going to be perfect.

760
00:44:22.041 --> 00:44:23.208
Now we just need shoes.

761
00:44:33.375 --> 00:44:34.375
Hmm.

762
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.750
So. Miss Giselle.
we must find a dress for you too.

763
00:44:41.833 --> 00:44:44.083
Oh. no. Thank you. I'm fine.

764
00:44:44.166 --> 00:44:45.583
Nonsense!

765
00:44:45.666 --> 00:44:50.583
These are one of a kind:
hand dipped in actual fairy dust.

766
00:44:50.666 --> 00:44:52.125
You will twinkle like a star.

767
00:44:52.208 --> 00:44:55.666
Oh. that is a very aggressive twinkle.
but I really don't need--

768
00:45:01.708 --> 00:45:02.708
Hmm.

769
00:45:06.708 --> 00:45:08.333
Miss Giselle?

770
00:45:10.166 --> 00:45:12.666
Miss Giselle. is everything okay?

771
00:45:15.333 --> 00:45:18.750
You know. I was just thinking.

772
00:45:19.375 --> 00:45:22.708
I really do have a figure for fashion.

773
00:45:22.791 --> 00:45:26.208
The finest hourglass
would shatter with envy.

774
00:45:26.291 --> 00:45:28.083
Oh.

775
00:45:29.375 --> 00:45:30.666
Let's try them all.

776
00:45:35.708 --> 00:45:36.916
Ooh. Oh.

777
00:45:44.791 --> 00:45:46.916
What is that smell?

778
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.958
Oh. hey. it's me. You know why?
I fell into a gutter!

779
00:45:50.041 --> 00:45:51.666
Oh!

780
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:53.541
Geez. you buy the whole town?

781
00:45:53.625 --> 00:45:56.458
Well… …it's not all for me.

782
00:45:56.541 --> 00:45:57.833
Hmm. Is that so?

783
00:45:57.916 --> 00:46:02.666
Picture our Morgan. the belle of the ball…

784
00:46:04.666 --> 00:46:05.750
in this!

785
00:46:07.125 --> 00:46:08.333
Huh?

786
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.041
Oh.

787
00:46:11.583 --> 00:46:12.583
Well…

788
00:46:12.666 --> 00:46:14.000
Well?

789
00:46:16.416 --> 00:46:19.375
Ooh. Okay.

790
00:46:19.458 --> 00:46:21.666
-Over to the right.

791
00:46:24.791 --> 00:46:30.083
It looks… different in this light.

792
00:46:30.916 --> 00:46:34.166
It's definitely air-conditioned!

793
00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:35.291
Oh!

794
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.625
What happened? It's torn to shreds.

795
00:46:39.708 --> 00:46:42.125
Why. it's hardly fit for a maid.

796
00:46:42.208 --> 00:46:44.041
Not exactly how I would've put it.

797
00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:47.083
What? It was a little judgy.

798
00:46:47.666 --> 00:46:50.208
-Well. perhaps I can mend it.
-No. No mending.

799
00:46:50.291 --> 00:46:51.291
I got it.

800
00:46:51.375 --> 00:46:54.125
I'll just march right down there
and demand an explanation.

801
00:46:54.916 --> 00:46:57.541
-Okay. well. I'm off to market.

802
00:46:57.625 --> 00:47:00.666
and then I'll have plenty of time
to get ready for the festival.

803
00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:02.083
-Mm-hmm.

804
00:47:03.083 --> 00:47:04.291
-Oh!
-Hmm?

805
00:47:05.333 --> 00:47:07.208
Thank you for everything. Stepmother.

806
00:47:13.375 --> 00:47:14.458
Stepmother?

807
00:47:17.541 --> 00:47:18.750
Oh. no.

808
00:47:19.375 --> 00:47:20.375
What?

809
00:47:21.625 --> 00:47:23.541
-What?
-Oh!

810
00:47:23.625 --> 00:47:26.333
My hair. it's so high.
and my dress is so low.

811
00:47:26.416 --> 00:47:28.791
And of course.
I want that dress to be made of rags.

812
00:47:28.875 --> 00:47:30.416
People like me always do.

813
00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:32.375
People like who?
What are you talking about?

814
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.125
Oh. no. Pip.

815
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.375
I'm afraid that my wish
is turning me into a--

816
00:47:37.458 --> 00:47:38.291
A what?

817
00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:40.708
It's turning me into a…

818
00:47:40.791 --> 00:47:41.666
A what?

819
00:47:44.166 --> 00:47:45.833
A wicked stepmother.

820
00:47:45.916 --> 00:47:48.041
What? Come on!

821
00:47:49.916 --> 00:47:52.166
Oh. actually. Yeah. No.
No. no. I can totally see it.

822
00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:54.791
Oh. no. Oh. Pip!

823
00:47:56.041 --> 00:47:58.625
Uh. hey. slow down!
Where are we going?

824
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:09.375
Who lives in this rat hole?

825
00:48:09.958 --> 00:48:11.208
Morgan does.

826
00:48:11.875 --> 00:48:14.750
Stepdaughters always live
in attics or dungeons.

827
00:48:14.833 --> 00:48:17.000
Oh. Pip. do you know what this means?

828
00:48:17.083 --> 00:48:19.416
I am the villain of Monrolasia!

829
00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:21.416
Well. you're not the only villain.

830
00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:24.458
Well. that's silly.
There can only ever be one villain.

831
00:48:25.083 --> 00:48:27.541
Not counting minions or pets.

832
00:48:28.375 --> 00:48:30.916
Or villains that you don't know
are villains until it's too late.

833
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.875
Well. Monrolasia might be different.

834
00:48:32.958 --> 00:48:37.125
'Cause there's you.
and then there's that evil queen you made.

835
00:48:37.208 --> 00:48:39.333
Who. Malvina? She's not evil. She's--

836
00:48:39.416 --> 00:48:41.375
Uh. did you see that outfit?

837
00:48:41.458 --> 00:48:45.375
With the big gestures and the crazy eyes!

838
00:48:46.666 --> 00:48:48.166
Oh. no.

839
00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:51.416
So. you better unwish that wish quick
before she. uh--

840
00:48:53.041 --> 00:48:54.041
-Pip?

841
00:48:54.125 --> 00:48:56.750
I don't feel so--

842
00:48:58.916 --> 00:49:00.125
What's wrong?

843
00:49:05.916 --> 00:49:08.291
-Oh! Oh.

844
00:49:11.958 --> 00:49:13.791
-Oh. Pip.

845
00:49:13.875 --> 00:49:17.166
Wicked stepmothers don't have
cute chipmunks as friends. They have--

846
00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:20.208
Cats!

847
00:49:20.291 --> 00:49:24.958
Oh. I can't be an evil cat.
They eat chipmunks!

848
00:49:25.041 --> 00:49:27.083
Oh. I'm gonna be sick!

849
00:49:32.916 --> 00:49:35.875
Surely there's an adventure
out here somewhere.

850
00:49:37.875 --> 00:49:39.375
A bellow of distress.

851
00:49:41.125 --> 00:49:42.666
Finally!

852
00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:44.333
What are we to do?

853
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.666
I'm not going in there.
You go in.

854
00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:48.708
Well. I'm certainly not going in there.

855
00:49:48.791 --> 00:49:50.083
Are you a dragon slayer?

856
00:49:50.166 --> 00:49:51.166
I believe I am.

857
00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:53.833
-Ooh.

858
00:49:53.916 --> 00:49:57.125
Never fear. I shall slay the beast.

859
00:49:57.208 --> 00:49:59.750
I wouldn't if I were you.
It is very large.

860
00:49:59.833 --> 00:50:02.083
-Oh.
-And cranky.

861
00:50:02.166 --> 00:50:06.791
Hmm. A very large and cranky dragon is
just what I've been looking for.

862
00:50:07.458 --> 00:50:08.458
Won't be a moment.

863
00:50:08.541 --> 00:50:11.708
-Onward. my sweetness.

864
00:50:23.833 --> 00:50:25.291
Have you done this before?

865
00:50:27.083 --> 00:50:32.375
Have-- Of course. yes. I have--
I have slain many a dragon.

866
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.708
-Good on you.
-Oh!

867
00:50:48.791 --> 00:50:51.000
-Ow. Oh. oh.

868
00:50:51.083 --> 00:50:54.083
-Hot. That's hot.

869
00:50:55.583 --> 00:50:56.583
I shall persevere.

870
00:50:57.458 --> 00:50:59.750
I shall conquer the craven beast!

871
00:50:59.833 --> 00:51:01.208
-I shall--

872
00:51:03.416 --> 00:51:04.416
Hey!

873
00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:08.291
No offense. sir. but you might want
to find another profession.

874
00:51:20.625 --> 00:51:22.125
Uh. what are you doing?

875
00:51:22.208 --> 00:51:25.791
Nancy said if we had any problems.
all we had to do was ask.

876
00:51:25.875 --> 00:51:29.291
Welcome to your magical
wishing wand experience!

877
00:51:29.375 --> 00:51:30.875
-If you should ever have a question…
-Oh.

878
00:51:30.958 --> 00:51:33.625
…just ask. and I shall appear.

879
00:51:33.708 --> 00:51:36.333
-Hello!
-Hey. we got no time for this.

880
00:51:36.416 --> 00:51:37.750
Good kitty. Good kitty.

881
00:51:37.833 --> 00:51:40.208
I'm sorry. My friend's a little anxious

882
00:51:40.291 --> 00:51:43.291
because we need to undo a wish
as soon as possible.

883
00:51:43.375 --> 00:51:44.916
Oh. Didn't like what you got. huh?

884
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.041
Well. I wished for a fairy-tale life.

885
00:51:48.125 --> 00:51:50.625
and it made my town
a place like Andalasia.

886
00:51:51.125 --> 00:51:54.208
And now I'm slowly turning
into a wicked stepmother.

887
00:51:54.291 --> 00:51:56.583
And I'm her soon-to-be-evil cat.

888
00:51:56.666 --> 00:51:58.791
-Oh!

889
00:51:58.875 --> 00:52:02.250
Oh. you changed the world.
What? You changed the world!

890
00:52:02.333 --> 00:52:04.750
Do you know how much magic
it takes to make that happen?

891
00:52:04.833 --> 00:52:05.666
-Whoo!

892
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:08.333
Where do you think
all that magic comes from. hmm?

893
00:52:08.416 --> 00:52:10.291
Andalasia. that's where.

894
00:52:10.375 --> 00:52:12.833
This is world-ending stuff.

895
00:52:12.916 --> 00:52:16.125
This is definitely a wish to be unwished.

896
00:52:16.791 --> 00:52:17.875
Good luck.

897
00:52:17.958 --> 00:52:19.833
-Uh-oh!

898
00:52:19.916 --> 00:52:22.666
What we need to know
is how to unwish the wish!

899
00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:24.166
Welcome to the magical--

900
00:52:24.250 --> 00:52:26.541
Whoa. it's you. Okay.

901
00:52:26.625 --> 00:52:30.166
See. we always build in a certain amount
of time to reverse the wish.

902
00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:31.875
You know. in case you change your mind.

903
00:52:31.958 --> 00:52:34.250
Thank goodness you are not
all villain yet.

904
00:52:34.333 --> 00:52:36.500
-Good.
-Watch the tassels. please.

905
00:52:36.583 --> 00:52:39.208
So. how far along are we? Let's see.

906
00:52:39.291 --> 00:52:40.791
Stepmothers. Well. they're wicked.

907
00:52:40.875 --> 00:52:42.875
Wicked good. Mmm.

908
00:52:42.958 --> 00:52:45.041
Check on that one.

909
00:52:45.125 --> 00:52:46.875
The other three are. well. vain…

910
00:52:46.958 --> 00:52:50.041
I'm not vain.
I just look good in everything.

911
00:52:50.125 --> 00:52:51.458
There it is. Okay.

912
00:52:51.541 --> 00:52:54.250
-Uh-oh.
-Cruel and ambitious.

913
00:52:54.333 --> 00:52:58.291
Yes. I would say your clock
has not run out yet.

914
00:52:58.375 --> 00:53:00.041
-Good.
-What kinda clock do you mean?

915
00:53:00.125 --> 00:53:01.583
-It could be anything.

916
00:53:01.666 --> 00:53:04.458
Have you seen
a flower dropping petals? Huh?

917
00:53:04.541 --> 00:53:05.625
-No?
-Mm-mmm.

918
00:53:05.708 --> 00:53:08.708
How about a clock
counting down to midnight

919
00:53:08.791 --> 00:53:10.875
-with an ominous-sounding chime?

920
00:53:10.958 --> 00:53:14.208
I mean. it's pretty on the nose.
but it's a classic!

921
00:53:14.291 --> 00:53:17.000
You know. that's not a litter box.
That's where I live.

922
00:53:17.083 --> 00:53:18.541
-Not to worry. though.

923
00:53:18.625 --> 00:53:20.958
-As long as you unwish it before midnight…

924
00:53:21.041 --> 00:53:22.333
…you'll be fine.

925
00:53:22.416 --> 00:53:23.541
What happens at midnight?

926
00:53:23.625 --> 00:53:27.166
On the last stroke of- 00.
the spell is set.

927
00:53:27.250 --> 00:53:29.833
and nothing will be as it was before.

928
00:53:29.916 --> 00:53:32.875
It means your wish is permanent.

929
00:53:32.958 --> 00:53:36.916
For all time. 'ime. 'ime. 'ime!

930
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.166
I did that for effect.

931
00:53:40.083 --> 00:53:41.208
Permanent.

932
00:53:41.291 --> 00:53:46.833
To unwish your wish. all you have to do
is use the wand. labeled "wand."

933
00:53:46.916 --> 00:53:49.416
-Where is it?
-Yes. yes. yes. It's right--

934
00:53:51.208 --> 00:53:52.208
Uh…

935
00:53:52.291 --> 00:53:53.916
-It's gone.

936
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.000
Oh. no.

937
00:53:55.083 --> 00:53:57.708
Well. good luck with all of this.
You need it.

938
00:53:59.958 --> 00:54:03.125
-Hurry! It's already--
-Two o'clock.

939
00:54:03.208 --> 00:54:05.916
-That means it's cruelty.

940
00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:08.458
No. no. no. no.

941
00:54:08.541 --> 00:54:10.625
We can't let this happen.
We have to fight it.

942
00:54:10.708 --> 00:54:13.500
I'm not an evil cat. I'm not an evil cat.
I'm not an evil cat.

943
00:54:13.583 --> 00:54:16.041
You stay here.
I have to find a way to stop this.

944
00:54:16.125 --> 00:54:18.625
And I have to lick this.
for some reason.

945
00:54:18.708 --> 00:54:19.541
Hmm.

946
00:54:19.625 --> 00:54:22.625
Ugh. Aw. yeah. that's real bad.

947
00:54:23.791 --> 00:54:27.208
It's all going to be okay.
We just need some magic.

948
00:54:27.291 --> 00:54:29.916
As we say in Andalasia.
"Magic fixes everything."

949
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.000
Or breaks it?

950
00:54:31.083 --> 00:54:32.958
But then you find more magic
to undo the magic.

951
00:54:33.041 --> 00:54:34.833
-and then everything's fine again.
-Good day. madam.

952
00:54:34.916 --> 00:54:37.125
Oh. Well. at least we look fine.

953
00:54:37.208 --> 00:54:39.666
That is not important right now.

954
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:40.958
Speak for yourself.

955
00:54:41.041 --> 00:54:43.750
But Robert will certainly appreciate it.

956
00:54:43.833 --> 00:54:45.875
If he isn't slain by something.

957
00:54:45.958 --> 00:54:49.541
Oh. no! She's right.
I mean. I'm right.

958
00:54:49.625 --> 00:54:54.375
He thinks he's a prince. With a sword.
Who knows what he'll find out there?

959
00:54:54.958 --> 00:54:55.958
Or Morgan.

960
00:54:57.083 --> 00:54:59.708
Although. nothing ever happens
to young girls in Andalasia.

961
00:54:59.791 --> 00:55:02.250
They just sing and pick flowers

962
00:55:02.333 --> 00:55:07.208
and sometimes get trapped in a tower
or a dungeon or get kidnapped by trolls.

963
00:55:07.291 --> 00:55:08.916
Or witches. Oh. my!

964
00:55:11.583 --> 00:55:13.000
Oh. that's nice.

965
00:55:18.041 --> 00:55:19.041
-Thank you.
-Oh.

966
00:55:19.125 --> 00:55:21.541
-That's… quite a frock.

967
00:55:21.625 --> 00:55:23.541
-What is she wearing?

968
00:55:23.625 --> 00:55:26.625
Good morning. Morgan.
You ready for the big festival tonight?

969
00:55:26.708 --> 00:55:29.958
Of course. Uh. my stepmother
even bought me a new dress.

970
00:55:30.041 --> 00:55:31.291
She's never done that before.

971
00:55:31.375 --> 00:55:33.833

Well. I would be careful then.

1010
00:58:38.458 --> 00:58:41.166
The squishy dragon fruit
can be a little bit…

1011
00:58:43.208 --> 00:58:44.250
…grumpy.

1012
00:58:51.208 --> 00:58:53.875
Sugar dates. figs and pistachios!

1013
00:58:55.166 --> 00:58:56.208
Can I help you. love?

1014
00:58:56.291 --> 00:58:58.708
Oh. yes. Do you have anything
that can reverse magic

1015
00:58:58.791 --> 00:59:01.375
that you didn't intend to use.
perhaps a poultice?

1016
00:59:01.458 --> 00:59:03.583
Or an unguent? Those can be very powerful.

1017
00:59:03.666 --> 00:59:05.041
No unguents. no.

1018
00:59:07.708 --> 00:59:09.750
This one makes your eyelashes curly.

1019
00:59:09.833 --> 00:59:10.916
Um…

1020
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:14.583
Oh. Curly eyelashes? Why not?

1021
00:59:14.666 --> 00:59:19.000
No! We don't have any time for vanity.
we need to pull ourselves together.

1022
00:59:19.708 --> 00:59:20.708
Um…

1023
00:59:22.333 --> 00:59:24.833
So. I assume
you'll be attending the ball this evening?

1024
00:59:24.916 --> 00:59:28.625
Yes. I am. I'm very excited.

1025
00:59:28.708 --> 00:59:31.291
-I've never been to a ball before.
-Oh. no. No. no. no.

1026
00:59:31.375 --> 00:59:33.125
Stepmothers never handle this well.

1027
00:59:33.208 --> 00:59:36.000
My mother loves these parties.
I feel like I've been to a thousand.

1028
00:59:36.083 --> 00:59:38.166
That must be wonderful.

1029
00:59:39.083 --> 00:59:40.666
Sure. Sometimes.

1030
00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:43.250
Just not what I would choose if I could.

1031
00:59:45.250 --> 00:59:46.250
I understand that.

1032
00:59:47.708 --> 00:59:52.125
Well. um. since this is your first ball.
maybe I could show you around?

1033
00:59:52.208 --> 00:59:54.791
Make sure you have the perfect partner
to dance with?

1034
00:59:55.583 --> 00:59:57.166
Uh…

1035
00:59:57.250 --> 01:00:00.625
Are there imperfect partners?

1036
01:00:00.708 --> 01:00:05.166
Oh. yes. Stick with me.
Your toes will be very happy you did.

1037
01:00:05.250 --> 01:00:08.041
Well. then on their behalf.
I thank you.

1038
01:00:09.625 --> 01:00:11.041
And I accept.

1039
01:00:11.125 --> 01:00:12.333
Then I am honored.

1040
01:00:20.666 --> 01:00:21.666
Hmm.

1041
01:00:23.708 --> 01:00:26.625
I'll give it to her!
She likes me when I give her things.

1042
01:00:26.708 --> 01:00:30.125
-But I'm the one who got it!
-I'm the one that pulled you out.

1043
01:00:31.541 --> 01:00:35.958
Any wand of Giselle's
can't possibly be that powerful.

1044
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.125
But. I suppose I should see
what I can do with it.

1045
01:00:41.208 --> 01:00:42.916
-Oh.
-Mm-hmm.

1046
01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.750
Let's see. I wish…

1047
01:00:45.833 --> 01:00:46.666
-Mm-hmm?

1048
01:00:47.416 --> 01:00:49.083
-…Ruby…
-Oh.

1049
01:00:50.083 --> 01:00:51.125
…was a toad.

1050
01:00:51.208 --> 01:00:53.208
Oh. no. no. no. no. no!

1051
01:00:58.750 --> 01:01:02.041
Oh. I'm a talking toad. I knew. I--

1052
01:01:02.125 --> 01:01:03.375
-Oh! Oh.

1053
01:01:03.458 --> 01:01:05.083
-Phew.
-Stupid chair!

1054
01:01:07.541 --> 01:01:11.458
Mirror! What kind of magic is this?

1055
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.083
Ask any question and I shall appear.

1056
01:01:15.166 --> 01:01:18.500
Well. that's an easy one.
It's Andalasian magic.

1057
01:01:18.583 --> 01:01:22.291
which means only a true son
or daughter of Andalasia can. um…

1058
01:01:22.375 --> 01:01:23.916
…use it.

1059
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.291
-Aah.
-Mmm.

1060
01:01:25.375 --> 01:01:27.541
Hello. Who are you?

1061
01:01:27.625 --> 01:01:28.875
Grab him.

1062
01:01:29.458 --> 01:01:31.166
-Gotcha!

1063
01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:32.541
Oh! Stop! Stop!

1064
01:01:32.625 --> 01:01:34.000
-He's a slippery little devil.

1065
01:01:34.083 --> 01:01:36.416
-I'm ticklish over there. My tassels!
-Oh. so cute!

1066
01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.000
Careful of the fine print.

1067
01:01:38.083 --> 01:01:42.083
I'm sorry.
Did you say. "Ask any question"?

1068
01:01:42.166 --> 01:01:45.291
Oh. no. Away. Poof! Away.
Come-- Poof!

1069
01:01:45.375 --> 01:01:48.625
No. no. you're not going anywhere.

1070
01:01:48.708 --> 01:01:50.958
I've got quite a number of questions.

1071
01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:54.583
-Lots and lots and lots of questions.
-Mm-hmm.

1072
01:01:54.666 --> 01:01:57.541
So you're going to start
from the beginning…

1073
01:01:57.625 --> 01:01:58.625
Don't ask me.

1074
01:01:58.708 --> 01:02:02.208
…or I might have to do a little editing.

1075
01:02:19.375 --> 01:02:20.750
That's quite the bouquet.

1076
01:02:20.833 --> 01:02:22.916
They're gonna match my dress perfectly.

1077
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.250
and they were growing wild
just by the market.

1078
01:02:25.333 --> 01:02:26.625
Aren't they beautiful?

1079
01:02:26.708 --> 01:02:28.708
The world is truly a miracle.

1080
01:02:29.333 --> 01:02:33.500
Oh. the most wonderful thing happened.
Tyson asked me to the festival.

1081
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.666
Hmm. Thrilling.

1082
01:02:36.916 --> 01:02:40.166
But I'm afraid you won't be attending
the festival tonight after all.

1083
01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:41.958
You have far too many chores to do.

1084
01:02:43.416 --> 01:02:44.833
But I've done all my chores.

1085
01:02:44.916 --> 01:02:47.833
What about the carpets in the hall?
Awfully dusty.

1086
01:02:48.333 --> 01:02:50.458
And the windows? I can't see a thing.

1087
01:02:50.541 --> 01:02:53.750
And then there's the gardening
and the sewing and the mending.

1088
01:02:53.833 --> 01:02:56.625
And don't forget about the chimneys.
Filthy business.

1089
01:02:58.083 --> 01:03:01.541
Yes. perhaps there are a few
that I've missed.

1090
01:03:01.625 --> 01:03:05.000
-Oh. but surely they can wait--
-Are you speaking back to me?

1091
01:03:05.083 --> 01:03:07.958
No. of course not.
I would never do such a thing.

1092
01:03:08.041 --> 01:03:10.750
Perhaps you need
to remember your place here.

1093
01:03:10.833 --> 01:03:14.500
Until you do. you are not to leave
this room. except for chores.

1094
01:03:14.583 --> 01:03:16.875
And then only when I say.

1095
01:03:16.958 --> 01:03:19.583
But I promised Tyson
that I would be there.

1096
01:03:19.666 --> 01:03:21.166
Oh. come now. Morgan.

1097
01:03:21.250 --> 01:03:25.083
A boy like Tyson has plenty of options
and. frankly. better ones.

1098
01:03:25.166 --> 01:03:26.875
But not to worry.

1099
01:03:27.541 --> 01:03:31.541
You can enjoy your evening
from up here in your little perch.

1100
01:03:32.083 --> 01:03:34.416
I'm sure it will be just as magical.

1101
01:03:35.625 --> 01:03:37.750
That is sarcasm. isn't it?

1102
01:03:37.833 --> 01:03:39.125
Huh.

1103
01:03:39.208 --> 01:03:41.416
Not so hard to understand after all.

1104
01:03:42.041 --> 01:03:43.291
-Stepmother.
-Hmm?

1105
01:03:44.333 --> 01:03:47.250
Stepmother. please.
You can't-- You can't be this cruel.

1106
01:03:48.708 --> 01:03:53.000
Oh. I can't help it. dear.
It's just who I am.

1107
01:03:54.416 --> 01:03:56.750
No. No!

1108
01:03:57.625 --> 01:04:00.000
No. you have to let me out!
You can't be this cruel.

1109
01:04:00.083 --> 01:04:02.500
-Please! Please. you can't do this.

1110
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Stepmother!

1111
01:04:07.708 --> 01:04:11.125
Apples! Juicy apples!

1112
01:04:11.208 --> 01:04:13.333
-Ooh.

1113
01:04:17.208 --> 01:04:19.875
Giant!

1114
01:04:20.375 --> 01:04:21.583
Giant!

1115
01:04:21.666 --> 01:04:22.916
A giant is coming?

1116
01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.375
A giant. it's coming!

1117
01:04:31.625 --> 01:04:32.625
Best take cover.

1118
01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:41.500
Ah!

1119
01:04:43.041 --> 01:04:44.625
Rope! Ha! Yes!

1120
01:04:44.708 --> 01:04:45.916
What are you doing?

1121
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.583
I'm gonna take this rope
and trip the giant.

1122
01:04:49.666 --> 01:04:52.916
And then he or she will be mine!

1123
01:05:09.541 --> 01:05:11.333
Oh. no!

1124
01:05:17.541 --> 01:05:19.500
Oh!

1125
01:05:19.583 --> 01:05:21.250
Oh. hey. It's all right.

1126
01:05:28.041 --> 01:05:30.750
No!

1127
01:05:30.833 --> 01:05:33.833
-Help me! I'm stuck!

1128
01:05:33.916 --> 01:05:35.333
-Oh!
-Help!

1129
01:05:35.416 --> 01:05:37.000
-Oh. no.
-Please! Help!

1130
01:05:37.083 --> 01:05:39.500
-I'm coming!

1131
01:05:42.291 --> 01:05:44.750
It's okay. It's okay.

1132
01:05:45.333 --> 01:05:46.500
It's all done now.

1133
01:05:46.583 --> 01:05:49.416
The big bad giant is gone.

1134
01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.166
Bella!

1135
01:05:51.250 --> 01:05:52.583
-Mommy!
-Oh.

1136
01:05:53.791 --> 01:05:54.875
Mom.

1137
01:05:56.083 --> 01:05:57.625
I'm sorry!

1138
01:05:57.708 --> 01:05:59.541
I turned away for one second!

1139
01:05:59.625 --> 01:06:02.500
-We are in your debt. sir.
-A true hero.

1140
01:06:02.583 --> 01:06:04.083
Oh. I wouldn't say that.

1141
01:06:04.166 --> 01:06:08.125
Thanks to you. our family is safe.
I'm forever grateful.

1142
01:06:12.833 --> 01:06:13.833
Hmm.

1143
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:31.833
Oh.

1144
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:36.750
Uh…

1145
01:06:37.833 --> 01:06:38.833
Okay.

1146
01:06:52.625 --> 01:06:53.833
Going somewhere?

1147
01:06:55.416 --> 01:06:57.916
No. it's--
It's not what you think.

1148
01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000
-I--
-Hmm.

1149
01:06:59.083 --> 01:07:01.041
I just have to tell him
why I won't be there.

1150
01:07:01.125 --> 01:07:03.625
Stepmother. please.
I'll be home in no time at all.

1151
01:07:03.708 --> 01:07:05.833
Oh. you're right. You will be.

1152
01:07:05.916 --> 01:07:07.833
Because you're not going anywhere.

1153
01:07:07.916 --> 01:07:10.708
Please! Please don't do this!

1154
01:07:10.791 --> 01:07:11.791
-Please--

1155
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.583
-Morgan?
-Stepmother?

1156
01:07:17.041 --> 01:07:18.125
Morgan.

1157
01:07:18.208 --> 01:07:19.500
Are you okay?

1158
01:07:19.583 --> 01:07:22.041
Never better!
Now we're going back up to your tower.

1159
01:07:23.958 --> 01:07:26.583
Oh. no. It can't be. Not yet.

1160
01:07:26.666 --> 01:07:28.250
What are you talking about?

1161
01:07:28.333 --> 01:07:29.875
Ambition.

1162
01:07:30.708 --> 01:07:33.000
It's the last one. and then I'm fully her.

1163
01:07:33.083 --> 01:07:34.208
What is going on?

1164
01:07:36.583 --> 01:07:38.500
-Oh. Morgan. I'm so sorry.
-What is--

1165
01:07:38.583 --> 01:07:40.375
It's all my fault.

1166
01:07:41.208 --> 01:07:44.041
I wished for a fairy-tale life.
and it's all gone terribly wrong.

1167
01:07:44.125 --> 01:07:45.958
-Or terribly right.

1168
01:07:46.041 --> 01:07:47.333
No. Wait!

1169
01:07:47.416 --> 01:07:50.208
Poor sweet Giselle doesn't know
what she wants. but I do.

1170
01:07:50.291 --> 01:07:53.291
-Stepmother. please just--
-Morgan. you have to listen to me.

1171
01:07:53.375 --> 01:07:55.166
Oh. yes. yes.

1172
01:07:55.250 --> 01:07:57.833
Perfect little Morgan.
not so perfect now. is she?

1173
01:07:59.125 --> 01:08:00.875
Don't you dare!

1174
01:08:02.083 --> 01:08:04.625
Oh. I'll dare all I like.

1175
01:08:04.708 --> 01:08:07.208
Stop it! You're-- You're scaring me.

1176
01:08:07.291 --> 01:08:08.291
I know.

1177
01:08:08.375 --> 01:08:10.458
I wish I could do it myself.

1178
01:08:10.541 --> 01:08:14.041
but who knows what would happen
if I went over there like this?

1179
01:08:14.958 --> 01:08:15.958
You have to go.

1180
01:08:17.458 --> 01:08:19.250
Yes!

1181
01:08:19.750 --> 01:08:21.583
Get help before it's too late.

1182
01:08:23.250 --> 01:08:26.916
-And you have to do it before midnight.
-Do what?

1183
01:08:27.625 --> 01:08:28.958
Save us.

1184
01:08:34.708 --> 01:08:35.708
Oh.

1185
01:08:38.583 --> 01:08:40.416
Wretched girl!

1186
01:08:44.875 --> 01:08:46.750
-You three!

1187
01:08:46.833 --> 01:08:48.791
You look like you're good with children.

1188
01:08:48.875 --> 01:08:52.583
My precious darling needs tending to.
See to it.

1189
01:08:56.583 --> 01:09:00.958
Mmm.
Oh. I feel superior to all living things.

1190
01:09:01.041 --> 01:09:03.250
I don't know why we were fighting this.

1191
01:09:03.333 --> 01:09:04.333
Indeed!

1192
01:09:04.416 --> 01:09:09.583
Who knew that being a villain
could feel so… liberating?

1193
01:09:10.375 --> 01:09:12.708
-Now. I just need to find that wand.

1194
01:09:21.375 --> 01:09:23.875
What have we here?

1195
01:09:36.208 --> 01:09:39.458
You know. stepmothers are many things.

1196
01:09:39.541 --> 01:09:42.083
But one of the things we are not
is powerful.

1197
01:09:42.166 --> 01:09:45.333
That's why we have to go through
all of these ridiculous manipulations.

1198
01:09:45.416 --> 01:09:47.291
We have no power of our own.

1199
01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:52.125
Now that Morgan's gone.
I'm not a stepmother anymore.

1200
01:09:53.125 --> 01:09:56.208
So I think it's time
I took on a new role in this town.

1201
01:09:57.625 --> 01:09:59.458
I'd like to be queen!

1202
01:10:00.291 --> 01:10:01.916
Yeah. but there's already a queen.

1203
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.791
and I feel like
she is really attached to the job.

1204
01:10:04.875 --> 01:10:07.541
That should be easy enough to fix.

1205
01:10:07.625 --> 01:10:13.250
A villain like Malvina can't resist
a chance to show the world how bad she is.

1206
01:10:13.333 --> 01:10:15.291
Mmm. So. where are we going?

1207
01:10:15.375 --> 01:10:16.625
I say we give it to her.

1208
01:10:17.958 --> 01:10:21.375
And then I have a little job for you.
my pet.

1209
01:10:21.458 --> 01:10:25.458
Ooh. Do I get to be evil now?

1210
01:10:25.541 --> 01:10:26.708
-Oh. yes.

1211
01:10:34.041 --> 01:10:35.125
Oh.

1212
01:10:35.208 --> 01:10:36.583
Uh-uh. Oh.

1213
01:10:44.458 --> 01:10:47.375
-Hmm?
-Mirror. mirror in her hand.

1214
01:10:47.458 --> 01:10:50.208
Who is the most blatantly insecure woman.

1215
01:10:50.291 --> 01:10:53.250
whose constant need
to ask her own reflection for validation

1216
01:10:53.333 --> 01:10:56.458
suggests that what she really needs to do
is to love herself.

1217
01:10:57.458 --> 01:10:58.833
in all the land?

1218
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.833
Giselle. a pleasure as always.

1219
01:11:04.458 --> 01:11:07.333
Yes. I imagine it is.

1220
01:11:07.416 --> 01:11:12.041
Well. I was hoping that I'd run into you.
and look at this. It seems I have.

1221
01:11:13.875 --> 01:11:16.291
So. what can I do for you then?

1222
01:11:17.041 --> 01:11:19.250
I thought it only fair
to give you a chance

1223
01:11:19.333 --> 01:11:24.166
to hand Monrolasia over to me peacefully
before any unpleasantness begins.

1224
01:11:24.666 --> 01:11:25.750
-Mmm?

1225
01:11:28.958 --> 01:11:31.000
And why would I do that?

1226
01:11:31.083 --> 01:11:34.208
Because this town is mine.

1227
01:11:35.125 --> 01:11:36.916
I think we both know that. don't we?

1228
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.458
Oh…

1229
01:11:40.041 --> 01:11:41.625
-Oh.

1230
01:11:42.916 --> 01:11:47.958
Sadly. I'm going to have to decline
your generous offer.

1231
01:11:48.041 --> 01:11:51.791
Having had a chat
with your little scroll friend.

1232
01:11:51.875 --> 01:11:55.666
it's clear that Monrolasia is everything
it was meant to be.

1233
01:11:56.166 --> 01:11:59.125
however that might have occurred.

1234
01:12:01.458 --> 01:12:02.583
Hmm.

1235
01:12:02.666 --> 01:12:04.958
Well. I tried.

1236
01:12:05.041 --> 01:12:08.375
But if you won't accept the offer.

1237
01:12:09.208 --> 01:12:11.791
you know there's only one thing
that can happen.

1238
01:12:11.875 --> 01:12:13.000
Indeed.

1239
01:12:14.208 --> 01:12:15.208
Dance-off!

1240
01:12:15.291 --> 01:12:16.958
You see what I gotta put up with?

1241
01:12:17.833 --> 01:12:19.291
One of us has to die.

1242
01:12:19.958 --> 01:12:23.041
Mmm. Say. midnight?

1243
01:12:23.125 --> 01:12:24.333
Sounds about right.

1244
01:12:24.833 --> 01:12:27.708
Again.
I'm so sorry to ruin your little party

1245
01:12:27.791 --> 01:12:30.583
with all of this messy
"destroying you" business.

1246
01:12:30.666 --> 01:12:32.625
Oh. Giselle.

1247
01:12:33.666 --> 01:12:35.083
You're hilarious.

1248
01:12:36.541 --> 01:12:39.750

Oh.

1307
01:16:24.125 --> 01:16:25.333
What happened?

1308
01:16:26.875 --> 01:16:27.875
The well!

1309
01:16:29.166 --> 01:16:31.750
Oh. no. no. no.

1310
01:16:32.541 --> 01:16:37.125
Why am I so pointy?
And my eyebrows are so perfect.

1311
01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:40.416
What the heck am I wearing?

1312
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.166
Is this Andalasia?

1313
01:16:44.666 --> 01:16:47.625
Wow. This is not what I pictured at all.

1314
01:16:47.708 --> 01:16:49.416
-Morgan?
-Nancy.

1315
01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:51.083
What are you doing here?

1316
01:16:51.166 --> 01:16:52.750
I'm not sure.

1317
01:16:52.833 --> 01:16:54.875
Something weird happened.

1318
01:16:54.958 --> 01:16:58.666
Did it. by any chance.
include a giant hole in your sky?

1319
01:16:58.750 --> 01:17:01.125
A what? What the heck is that?

1320
01:17:01.625 --> 01:17:04.541
Last night.
that mysterious hole appeared in the sky

1321
01:17:04.625 --> 01:17:08.750
and started pulling all of our magic
into some other place.

1322
01:17:08.833 --> 01:17:09.958
Oh.

1323
01:17:10.041 --> 01:17:13.000
Okay. Morgan. tell us what happened.

1324
01:17:13.083 --> 01:17:18.000
Well. Giselle and I had
a pretty bad fight. And then. uh…

1325
01:17:18.083 --> 01:17:19.208
And then what?

1326
01:17:19.291 --> 01:17:21.833
-I'm not sure. exactly.

1327
01:17:21.916 --> 01:17:25.875
But the last thing I remember is
Giselle acting really. really cruel.

1328
01:17:25.958 --> 01:17:29.833
And then she said something about
making a wish and that I had to fix it.

1329
01:17:29.916 --> 01:17:33.583
Oh. Edward. The wishing wand.
She must have used it.

1330
01:17:33.666 --> 01:17:37.125
But what could she have possibly
wished for that would have done all this?

1331
01:17:37.208 --> 01:17:42.333
Well. whatever it was. it turned our whole
town into some kind of fairy-tale place.

1332
01:17:42.416 --> 01:17:44.000
Just like Andalasia.

1333
01:17:44.708 --> 01:17:47.458
Morgan. a wish so big
that it changes a world

1334
01:17:47.541 --> 01:17:49.375
wouldn't need a little of our magic.

1335
01:17:49.875 --> 01:17:53.250
Why. it would-- It would need all of it.
every last bit.

1336
01:17:53.333 --> 01:17:56.541
Wait.
But everything here is made of magic.

1337
01:17:56.625 --> 01:18:00.125
If it's all gone.
then what happens to Andalasia?

1338
01:18:00.208 --> 01:18:01.833
If we can't reverse this.

1339
01:18:01.916 --> 01:18:04.666
everything Andalasian
will be gone forever.

1340
01:18:04.750 --> 01:18:08.541
I don't want Andalasia
to disappear forever.

1341
01:18:08.625 --> 01:18:10.291
-I know. I know.
-No.

1342
01:18:10.375 --> 01:18:11.875
There must be something we can do.

1343
01:18:11.958 --> 01:18:17.250
Giselle just needs to remember who she is.
and then she can fix all of this.

1344
01:18:17.333 --> 01:18:18.416
I know she can.

1345
01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:20.916
Remember? Edward!

1346
01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.166
Of course.

1347
01:18:22.250 --> 01:18:24.375
The magic of memories.

1348
01:18:24.458 --> 01:18:26.333
What? You mean Giselle's memory tree?

1349
01:18:27.125 --> 01:18:28.333
It's real?

1350
01:18:28.416 --> 01:18:32.083
It is.
And it's the strongest magic there is.

1351
01:18:40.416 --> 01:18:41.416
Hello.

1352
01:18:42.791 --> 01:18:43.791
Who are you?

1353
01:18:44.291 --> 01:18:45.833
We're your garden fairies.

1354
01:18:45.916 --> 01:18:49.208
-I'd turn around if I were you.
-Unless you wanna get thrown off the roof.

1355
01:18:50.916 --> 01:18:51.916
Hmm.

1356
01:18:54.416 --> 01:18:56.791
Ah!

1357
01:18:56.875 --> 01:19:00.333
Seems like the babysitters
have had quite the day.

1358
01:19:00.416 --> 01:19:03.666
So have I. dear.

1359
01:19:05.958 --> 01:19:06.958
Hmm.

1360
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:08.750
Hmm.

1361
01:19:12.541 --> 01:19:16.000
We're really going to need
something more regal than this.

1362
01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:17.666
And minions.

1363
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:20.791
We'll definitely need minions
if we want anything done right.

1364
01:19:21.875 --> 01:19:23.875
Where did you say Morgan was again?

1365
01:19:23.958 --> 01:19:25.333
Oh.

1366
01:19:25.416 --> 01:19:26.500
Who knows?

1367
01:19:26.583 --> 01:19:28.916
-Hmm.
-Probably singing to a mouse or something.

1368
01:19:29.708 --> 01:19:31.833
But who cares? Tonight's about me.

1369
01:19:34.750 --> 01:19:35.750
Stop the carriage.

1370
01:19:35.833 --> 01:19:36.833
Whoa!

1371
01:19:36.916 --> 01:19:37.791
Robert.

1372
01:19:38.458 --> 01:19:40.500
Morgan wouldn't just disappear like this.

1373
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.750
Unless something's happened.

1374
01:19:43.375 --> 01:19:45.791
Something's wrong.
I'm going to go find her.

1375
01:19:45.875 --> 01:19:48.000
Oh. well. another fruitless quest.

1376
01:19:48.083 --> 01:19:50.458
-but… …good luck with that.

1377
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Drive!

1378
01:19:55.083 --> 01:19:56.458
-Hyah!

1379
01:20:05.875 --> 01:20:10.375
Okay. I knew it was a tree house.
but that's a "tree house."

1380
01:20:10.458 --> 01:20:12.500
-We do whimsy really well.
-Huh.

1381
01:20:12.583 --> 01:20:14.125
I think the tree is over here.

1382
01:20:19.875 --> 01:20:21.250
That's it. That's the tree!

1383
01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:33.666
Oh. no.

1384
01:20:40.541 --> 01:20:41.583
It's dead.

1385
01:20:43.208 --> 01:20:46.416
Never fear. We will come up with something
very smart at the very last minute

1386
01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:47.958
that solves all our problems.

1387
01:20:48.041 --> 01:20:49.083
Edward.

1388
01:20:49.750 --> 01:20:51.333
What? That's how it works here.

1389
01:20:51.416 --> 01:20:53.333
There has to be something we can do.

1390
01:20:54.083 --> 01:20:58.791
You know. for a little girl with no mom.

1391
01:20:58.875 --> 01:21:01.666
seeing a princess hanging from a billboard
was magic.

1392
01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:04.583
I-I knew it was real.
I didn't even have to think about it.

1393
01:21:04.666 --> 01:21:06.583
Things were so much easier back then.

1394
01:21:06.666 --> 01:21:08.625
-I'll never forget you.
-Whoa.

1395
01:21:08.708 --> 01:21:09.791
What was that?

1396
01:21:09.875 --> 01:21:11.791
You brought the flower back to life.

1397
01:21:11.875 --> 01:21:12.916
I did?

1398
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.125
But how? I'm not magic.

1399
01:21:15.208 --> 01:21:16.708
No. but these memories are.

1400
01:21:17.208 --> 01:21:19.041
And they live inside you as well.

1401
01:21:19.125 --> 01:21:20.708
Which means their magic does too.

1402
01:21:20.791 --> 01:21:22.500
Morgan. you're the key.

1403
01:21:22.583 --> 01:21:25.166
That's what Giselle meant
by telling you to save us.

1404
01:21:25.250 --> 01:21:28.166
So. maybe if I can bring
some of this tree back.

1405
01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:31.875
the magic in it will get her to remember
that who she really is. is good.

1406
01:21:32.375 --> 01:21:33.583
Then she'll fix this.

1407
01:21:34.458 --> 01:21:36.166
I think we're running out of time.

1408
01:21:37.208 --> 01:21:38.750
But what if it doesn't work?

1409
01:21:38.833 --> 01:21:40.458
Morgan. it will.

1410
01:21:40.541 --> 01:21:43.750
You just have to remember
all the good in these moments

1411
01:21:43.833 --> 01:21:45.375
because you're a part of them.

1412
01:21:45.916 --> 01:21:48.083

1451

{\an8}It-- It's my memory tree.

1452
01:25:01.166 --> 01:25:02.500
{\an8}I can bring her back.

1453
01:25:54.083 --> 01:25:55.833
I think I'm just gonna go get some air.

1454
01:25:55.916 --> 01:25:58.291
Whatever. dear. Back by midnight.

1455
01:26:04.875 --> 01:26:06.791
I should be at that party.

1456
01:26:06.875 --> 01:26:08.041
Instead. I'm here.

1457
01:26:08.125 --> 01:26:11.375
-babysitting you babysitting this wand.

1458
01:26:11.458 --> 01:26:14.125
-And all because she doesn't trust you.

1459
01:26:14.208 --> 01:26:16.000
Or maybe she doesn't trust you.

1460
01:26:16.083 --> 01:26:18.083
I'm not the one
she tried to turn into a toad.

1461
01:26:18.166 --> 01:26:20.666
-Well. maybe she likes toads.

1462
01:26:20.750 --> 01:26:25.541
No matter what reptile she turns you into.
I am her right-hand lady.

1463
01:26:25.625 --> 01:26:28.416
Which means that
you should be doing the dumb stuff.

1464
01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:31.791
And I should be looking fabulous
at the festival.

1465
01:26:33.208 --> 01:26:34.208
Okay. then go.

1466
01:26:34.708 --> 01:26:38.041
And I'll tell Malvina that
you abandoned the wand.

1467
01:26:38.125 --> 01:26:41.541
and we'll see who ends up a warty toad.

1468
01:26:43.041 --> 01:26:46.375
I would never be the warty toad.

1469
01:26:46.458 --> 01:26:48.916
-Look in a mirror lately? An honest one?

1470
01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.875
-Ooh.

1471
01:26:50.958 --> 01:26:53.583
-Oh. it's gonna be like that?
-Uh-huh.

1472
01:26:53.666 --> 01:26:56.166
Well. I guess
we will both just babysit the wand.

1473
01:26:56.250 --> 01:26:57.333
I guess we will.

1474
01:26:57.916 --> 01:26:59.750
-Little advice. Get a life.

1475
01:26:59.833 --> 01:27:01.083
She hates you both.

1476
01:27:01.166 --> 01:27:02.958
-Whoo-hoo!
-Look out! Incoming!

1477
01:27:03.041 --> 01:27:04.666
-Hey. Scroll! Scram!

1478
01:27:04.750 --> 01:27:06.000
Watch it!

1479
01:27:06.083 --> 01:27:08.458
If there are no more questions. goodbye.

1480
01:27:10.291 --> 01:27:13.333
Let go of my tail!

1481
01:27:13.416 --> 01:27:16.458
Okay. Ladies. have you learned nothing?
Gotta be quicker than that.

1482
01:27:16.541 --> 01:27:18.250
-How is he so fast?
-Oh.

1483
01:27:18.333 --> 01:27:19.541
Oh.

1484
01:27:19.625 --> 01:27:22.125
-We can get him down.
-Oh. hey. wait. Come on!

1485
01:27:23.125 --> 01:27:24.666
And away we go!

1486
01:27:25.666 --> 01:27:29.333
Hey. you ladies have been great.
but I got a ball to catch. See you later.

1487
01:27:36.958 --> 01:27:38.125
Do I look ready?

1488
01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:44.041
There you are. my pet. Any problems?

1489
01:27:44.791 --> 01:27:46.541
Nope. Turns out I'm good at evil.

1490
01:27:48.708 --> 01:27:53.166
Well. now comes the fun part.

1491
01:27:55.333 --> 01:27:56.625
I'm ready now.

1492
01:27:58.666 --> 01:28:00.125
Hope I'm not underdressed.

1493
01:28:00.791 --> 01:28:02.875
Oh. wait a second. What is this?

1494
01:28:05.125 --> 01:28:06.708
Ooh. Ooh. yeah.

1495
01:28:08.333 --> 01:28:11.250
Uh. Uh. hey! Wait a minute. I'm with her.

1496
01:28:11.333 --> 01:28:13.250
Folks. this is my stop.

1497
01:28:13.333 --> 01:28:14.750
Hello? Mr. Wig.

1498
01:28:16.333 --> 01:28:19.208
Forgot abou-- I'm with her.
I gotta get out of here. Hey!

1499
01:28:19.291 --> 01:28:22.291
Hey! Hey. what's happening? Wait a minute.

1500
01:28:22.375 --> 01:28:23.875
You forgot about me!

1501
01:28:38.791 --> 01:28:39.791
Hmm.

1502
01:28:43.541 --> 01:28:46.083
Morgan. where have you been? Are you okay?

1503
01:28:46.166 --> 01:28:47.666
No. Actually I'm really. really not.

1504
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:49.208
-Can I get a lift?
-Of course.

1505
01:28:49.291 --> 01:28:51.208
Go! I'll be right behind you.

1506
01:28:58.291 --> 01:28:59.541
Now. let's see.

1507
01:29:01.250 --> 01:29:04.875
I wish to be Queen of Monrolasia.

1508
01:29:08.333 --> 01:29:09.333
Ah.

1509
01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.541
Make way! Make way!

1510
01:29:13.166 --> 01:29:14.333
We have to get inside.

1511
01:29:25.166 --> 01:29:27.750
I believe you are in my seat.

1512
01:29:32.458 --> 01:29:33.875
You again.

1513
01:29:37.166 --> 01:29:42.458
And I believe it's time we end this
once and for all.

1514
01:29:42.958 --> 01:29:45.958
Oh. yes. Please.

1515
01:30:02.750 --> 01:30:04.708
Stupid chair!

1516
01:30:04.791 --> 01:30:07.875
Why does this keep happening?

1517
01:30:14.375 --> 01:30:15.875
Is this my mother's doing?

1518
01:30:17.458 --> 01:30:20.041
No. it's Andalasia.

1519
01:30:20.125 --> 01:30:21.500
It's breaking through.

1520
01:30:23.625 --> 01:30:26.500
Okay. Deep breath. Suck in.

1521
01:30:43.333 --> 01:30:44.458
I wish.

1522
01:31:01.166 --> 01:31:03.125
Guards.

1523
01:31:07.666 --> 01:31:09.291
Destroy her.

1524
01:31:11.083 --> 01:31:12.208
I wish.

1525
01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:20.625
Mmm.

1526
01:31:20.708 --> 01:31:23.833
They're just butterflies! Idiots!

1527
01:31:33.208 --> 01:31:35.000
-Your Majesty! Your Majesty!
-Oh.

1528
01:31:35.083 --> 01:31:36.666
Ruby wants to tell you something
about the wand.

1529
01:31:36.750 --> 01:31:39.458
-Oh. does she?

1530
01:31:40.875 --> 01:31:42.208
-Hi!

1531
01:31:43.083 --> 01:31:45.833
It was her fault.
She's the one that should be the toad.

1532
01:31:45.916 --> 01:31:47.625
And you're the one who let the cat in.

1533
01:31:47.708 --> 01:31:49.958
You two are the worst!

1534
01:31:50.041 --> 01:31:53.208
-Huh?

1535
01:31:59.375 --> 01:32:00.958
Speaking of toads.

1536
01:32:01.041 --> 01:32:02.750
I wish.

1537
01:32:20.166 --> 01:32:22.166
-Nancy!
-Robert!

1538
01:32:22.250 --> 01:32:23.458
Have you seen Morgan?

1539
01:32:23.541 --> 01:32:26.208
-Yes. She's here. She's fine.
-Oh. thank goodness.

1540
01:32:26.291 --> 01:32:28.041
My God. people are going crazy.

1541
01:32:28.125 --> 01:32:30.875
I know. I know. Listen. it's Giselle.
She's under a curse.

1542
01:32:30.958 --> 01:32:33.375
We have to save her so she can stop this.

1543
01:32:33.458 --> 01:32:34.333
A curse?

1544
01:32:35.375 --> 01:32:36.375
Let's go!

1545
01:32:41.916 --> 01:32:42.916
Morgan!

1546
01:32:43.916 --> 01:32:45.041
Dad!

1547
01:32:45.625 --> 01:32:46.625
Dad!

1548
01:32:46.708 --> 01:32:48.166
How have you fared? Oh!

1549
01:32:48.250 --> 01:32:50.166
I have searched both hither and yon.

1550
01:32:50.250 --> 01:32:51.833
We need to get inside. Let's go.

1551
01:32:51.916 --> 01:32:53.541
When did my daughter become so brave?

1552
01:32:54.333 --> 01:32:55.416
Now we save Giselle.

1553
01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:56.958
Time to be heroes.

1554
01:33:18.375 --> 01:33:20.500
-Need a hand?

1555
01:33:21.625 --> 01:33:23.500
-Mother. stop this!
-Giselle!

1556
01:33:37.875 --> 01:33:39.458
-Hmm.

1557
01:33:40.666 --> 01:33:42.708
Useless garbage.

1558
01:33:43.333 --> 01:33:44.166
No!

1559
01:33:45.166 --> 01:33:46.166
Giselle. no!

1560
01:33:53.166 --> 01:33:54.791
This is a very nice place.

1561
01:33:54.875 --> 01:33:56.958
-Yeah.
-This is a date.

1562
01:33:57.041 --> 01:33:59.708
-She's very kind and very sweet.
-Yeah.

1563
01:34:00.416 --> 01:34:03.041
-Giselle!
-I'm right here. Morgan.

1564
01:34:04.333 --> 01:34:05.708
Hey. wait for me!

1565
01:34:07.041 --> 01:34:09.541
Mom. where are you going?

1566
01:34:09.625 --> 01:34:11.500
I'm not going anywhere.

1567
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:15.875
You'll always be a princess to me.

1568
01:34:18.416 --> 01:34:20.041
Higher! Higher. Mom!

1569
01:34:27.125 --> 01:34:30.041
Uh-oh.
What the heck is going on around here?

1570
01:34:30.625 --> 01:34:31.750
Uh. Giselle!

1571
01:34:40.625 --> 01:34:41.625
Oh.

1572
01:34:55.708 --> 01:34:56.708
Robert.

1573
01:35:00.833 --> 01:35:01.916
My sweet Giselle.

1574
01:35:03.208 --> 01:35:04.583
You've come back to me.

1575
01:35:05.666 --> 01:35:09.083
I'm so sorry. I don't want minions.

1576
01:35:13.625 --> 01:35:15.500
Nancy. where's Edward?

1577
01:35:15.583 --> 01:35:17.666
He stayed behind to protect Andalasia.

1578
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:18.750
Oh. no.

1579
01:35:18.833 --> 01:35:20.666
-Please. we have to hurry.

1580
01:35:22.833 --> 01:35:24.208
The magic is disappearing.

1581
01:35:25.333 --> 01:35:28.500
We have to stop this
or everything Andalasian will die.

1582
01:35:30.875 --> 01:35:32.416
And that means that you…

1583
01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.000
will?

1584
01:35:35.083 --> 01:35:36.083
No.

1585
01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:38.625
No. I--

1586
01:35:39.458 --> 01:35:40.541
I can fix this.

1587
01:35:41.125 --> 01:35:42.375
Stop!

1588
01:35:43.250 --> 01:35:45.166
I wouldn't if I were you.

1589
01:35:47.291 --> 01:35:48.541
-Morgan.

1590
01:35:48.625 --> 01:35:50.000
Morgan!

1591
01:35:50.083 --> 01:35:52.875
-Mother. what are you doing?
-Oh. relax. darling.

1592
01:35:52.958 --> 01:35:55.041
It's just a little sleeping potion.

1593
01:35:55.125 --> 01:35:59.500
It was actually meant for Giselle.
but this'll do.

1594
01:35:59.583 --> 01:36:01.125
Malvina. you have to undo it.

1595
01:36:01.208 --> 01:36:02.333
Oh. and I shall.

1596
01:36:02.416 --> 01:36:06.250
Your helpful scroll explained
at the last stroke of midnight.

1597
01:36:06.333 --> 01:36:07.500
your wish is permanent.

1598
01:36:07.583 --> 01:36:09.541
And I like this world.

1599
01:36:09.625 --> 01:36:12.000
So you're going to drop that wand
and let the clock strike.

1600
01:36:12.083 --> 01:36:14.291
and then. she'll be free.

1601
01:36:14.375 --> 01:36:18.625
But if I do that. Andalasia dies.

1602
01:36:19.541 --> 01:36:22.208
And if you don't do it. she dies.

1603
01:36:23.375 --> 01:36:25.916
-No.
-Cease. evil witch.

1604
01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.916
Oh. Robert. Don't you think
you're being a little harsh?

1605
01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.208
Malvina. please.

1606
01:36:31.333 --> 01:36:32.458
This isn't you.

1607
01:36:32.541 --> 01:36:33.500
It is now.

1608
01:36:33.583 --> 01:36:38.041
Just as you wished it.

1609
01:36:38.125 --> 01:36:39.875
No!

1610
01:36:59.333 --> 01:37:00.583
Morgan.

1611
01:37:10.791 --> 01:37:13.000
I feel weak.

1612
01:37:13.083 --> 01:37:14.625
Giselle. Giselle.

1613
01:37:14.708 --> 01:37:17.250
-What's happening?

1614
01:37:17.333 --> 01:37:19.375
-Are you okay?
-I don't know.

1615
01:37:39.541 --> 01:37:40.708
No.

1616
01:37:40.791 --> 01:37:47.458
Isn't it marvelous when two worlds
come together in such… harmony?

1617
01:37:56.041 --> 01:38:00.166
When the clock strikes- 00.
the spell will be set.

1618
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:04.875
No.

1619
01:38:07.666 --> 01:38:09.708
-This is not how it ends.
-Huh.

1620
01:38:10.458 --> 01:38:11.833
I'm coming with you.

1621
01:38:11.916 --> 01:38:13.208
Robert.

1622
01:38:13.958 --> 01:38:16.208
Some heroes.

1623
01:38:25.791 --> 01:38:28.208
-What are we gonna do?
-It can't strike midnight!

1624
01:38:51.333 --> 01:38:54.250
It's like a wish come true.

1625
01:38:54.791 --> 01:38:56.041
-Please hold on.

1626
01:38:56.125 --> 01:38:57.500
I'm so sorry.

1627
01:38:57.583 --> 01:38:58.833
This is all my fault.

1628
01:38:58.916 --> 01:39:02.000
No. no. no. There has to be
something else that we can do.

1629
01:39:02.083 --> 01:39:03.708
-I just wish…
-No.

1630
01:39:06.916 --> 01:39:09.250
That piece of wand. Grab it.

1631
01:39:09.791 --> 01:39:12.125
Ticktock. ticktock.

1632
01:39:14.916 --> 01:39:16.708
-Tyson. your sword!

1633
01:39:19.333 --> 01:39:20.625
Hold on!

1634
01:39:24.416 --> 01:39:25.750
Morgan.

1635
01:39:25.833 --> 01:39:28.833
You can't break magic.

1636
01:39:29.625 --> 01:39:30.833
Listen to me.

1637
01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:34.708
You have to make a new wish. Morgan.

1638
01:39:34.791 --> 01:39:36.458
My magic is almost gone.

1639
01:39:37.250 --> 01:39:40.916
Oh. according to your droll little scroll.

1640
01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:45.416
no one but a true Andalasian
can use that broken piece of kindling.

1641
01:39:45.500 --> 01:39:47.500
But go for it.

1642
01:39:48.291 --> 01:39:53.333
She's right. I can't.
I'm not a true daughter of Andalasia.

1643
01:39:53.416 --> 01:39:56.250
You are a true daughter of Andalasia.

1644
01:39:57.625 --> 01:40:00.291

-Please.

1669
01:41:34.208 --> 01:41:35.458
Giselle.

1670
01:41:39.041 --> 01:41:40.625
What do I wish for?

1671
01:41:40.708 --> 01:41:44.333
Ticktock. ticktock.

1672
01:41:46.125 --> 01:41:47.125
Wait.

1673
01:41:47.791 --> 01:41:48.875
Where are the chimes?

1674
01:41:50.291 --> 01:41:51.708
Why isn't it midnight?

1675
01:41:53.833 --> 01:41:56.000
Why isn't it midnight?

1676
01:42:18.666 --> 01:42:23.291
I wish I was home… with my mom.

1677
01:42:53.791 --> 01:42:56.291
-Oh. yes. sweet thing.

1678
01:42:57.500 --> 01:42:58.750
Mom.

1679
01:43:00.916 --> 01:43:02.833
Morgan.

1680
01:43:02.916 --> 01:43:04.000
Mom!

1681
01:43:04.083 --> 01:43:05.333
You did it!

1682
01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:07.208
I was so scared.

1683
01:43:07.291 --> 01:43:10.208
I know. But you saved me.

1684
01:43:11.250 --> 01:43:12.500
You saved us all.

1685
01:43:14.250 --> 01:43:16.333
Good morning.

1686
01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:21.375
Oh. I had the craziest dreams last night.

1687
01:43:22.500 --> 01:43:25.291
-Good morning.

1688
01:43:28.458 --> 01:43:30.666
He really doesn't remember anything?

1689
01:43:31.333 --> 01:43:35.166
Only the person who wields the magic
ever really remembers it clearly.

1690
01:43:35.250 --> 01:43:37.208
To everyone else.
it's sort of like a dream.

1691
01:43:38.375 --> 01:43:42.083
Well. I can't wait for you to explain
to him how he sang with a garbage pail

1692
01:43:42.166 --> 01:43:44.208
-and defeated an evil queen.

1693
01:43:44.958 --> 01:43:47.250
-Good luck with that.

1694
01:43:55.833 --> 01:43:58.958
I had a horrible dream about toads.

1695
01:43:59.625 --> 01:44:00.833
-Me too.

1696
01:44:03.375 --> 01:44:04.375
Good morning. Edgar.

1697
01:44:04.958 --> 01:44:06.583
Giselle. the usual?

1698
01:44:07.083 --> 01:44:08.833
Oh. yes. please. Thank you.

1699
01:44:14.666 --> 01:44:17.708
Good morning. I'm sorry to interrupt.

1700
01:44:18.291 --> 01:44:19.625
I just thought I'd say hi.

1701
01:44:20.125 --> 01:44:25.875
And I really wanted to apologize
for a lot of things.

1702
01:44:27.250 --> 01:44:29.875
I just really wanted Morgan
to be happy here.

1703
01:44:29.958 --> 01:44:32.333
and I guess I got a little carried away.

1704
01:44:36.291 --> 01:44:38.458
Okay. Enjoy your coffees.

1705
01:44:41.583 --> 01:44:42.583
You know…

1706
01:44:47.958 --> 01:44:48.958
Um.

1707
01:44:50.125 --> 01:44:55.625
I have the tendency
to get carried away myself sometimes.

1708
01:44:56.250 --> 01:44:57.625
No.

1709
01:44:57.708 --> 01:45:04.083
It turns out we do have room on one
of our committees. if you'd be interested.

1710
01:45:04.166 --> 01:45:05.458
Mmm. Hmm?

1711
01:45:06.291 --> 01:45:09.625
I think our town could use
someone like you.

1712
01:45:11.291 --> 01:45:13.625
I'd love that.

1713
01:45:14.583 --> 01:45:16.041
-Oh!
-Oh. we're hugging.

1714
01:45:16.125 --> 01:45:17.958
-Okay.

1715
01:45:18.041 --> 01:45:20.291
-Not your chair.
-Oh. right. Nope. Okay.

1716
01:45:20.375 --> 01:45:21.625
Mm-hmm. Yep.

1717
01:45:24.916 --> 01:45:29.791
And so. a new story for Giselle
and her family began in Monroeville.

1718
01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:32.000
Without the magic this time.

1719
01:45:32.833 --> 01:45:36.916
Robert opened a small practice in town.
and never rode the train again.

1720
01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.083
Sofia sprouted up.

1721
01:45:39.166 --> 01:45:40.833
-And Morgan…
-Hey. Morgan!

1722
01:45:46.166 --> 01:45:48.708
-Um. I'll be back in a sec.
-Mm-hmm.

1723
01:45:48.791 --> 01:45:51.250
Well. she was still a teenager.

1724
01:45:51.333 --> 01:45:52.958
-Stop looking at me. It's creepy.
-No. I'm just--

1725
01:45:53.041 --> 01:45:54.458
-Not looking!
-Gonna pour some--

1726
01:45:54.541 --> 01:45:56.875
-I am so sorry I'm late.
-Oh!

1727
01:45:56.958 --> 01:45:59.083
-There was a gaggle of hobgoblins…
-That's okay.

1728
01:45:59.166 --> 01:46:00.291
…in the woods today.

1729
01:46:00.375 --> 01:46:03.041
-They just wouldn't give up.

1730
01:46:03.125 --> 01:46:05.291
It took the whole village
to drive 'em out.

1731
01:46:05.375 --> 01:46:07.583
-Where is Edward? Did he stay behind?

1732
01:46:07.666 --> 01:46:10.208
Oh. no. no. no. He's here.
He's engaged in battle.

1733
01:46:10.291 --> 01:46:12.541
-Of course.
-Back. you wild beasts! Back!

1734
01:46:13.708 --> 01:46:14.708
You're dead!

1735
01:46:14.791 --> 01:46:16.416
No. I'm not. You merely grazed me.

1736
01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:17.875
-You grazed me!

1737
01:46:17.958 --> 01:46:19.250
I'm not dead.

1738
01:46:19.333 --> 01:46:20.791
Look. I have barely a limp!

1739
01:46:24.875 --> 01:46:27.125
Your tiny peasants are quite fierce.

1740
01:46:28.958 --> 01:46:30.875
-As are you. Robert…
-Oh. no.

1741
01:46:30.958 --> 01:46:35.583
…who so grandly helped save the day
with my sword.

1742
01:46:35.666 --> 01:46:39.416
Well. may your adventures
with my sword continue. my good man.

1743
01:46:39.500 --> 01:46:43.708
-Actually. Edward. I've hung up the sword.
-Ah.

1744
01:46:43.791 --> 01:46:46.166
I'm happy to say
I don't really need it here.

1745
01:46:46.250 --> 01:46:47.625
-Really?
-Yeah.

1746
01:46:47.708 --> 01:46:49.083
-Yeah.
-What a tragedy.

1747
01:46:49.166 --> 01:46:50.291
Can I have it back?

1748
01:46:50.375 --> 01:46:51.541
-Yes. Of course you can.

1749
01:46:51.625 --> 01:46:53.500
-Okay. Great.
-Shall we feast?

1750
01:46:53.583 --> 01:46:55.041
-Absolutely.
-What can I get you?

1751
01:46:55.125 --> 01:46:57.833
-But first. we have a very special gift.

1752
01:46:57.916 --> 01:47:01.208
Whatever dish you wish
will appear on this plate.

1753
01:47:01.291 --> 01:47:02.541
-Hmm?
-Oh. Oh.

1754
01:47:02.625 --> 01:47:04.250
That's all that it does. That's--

1755
01:47:04.333 --> 01:47:06.166
-Right? That's-- We're fairly certain.
-Yeah.

1756
01:47:06.833 --> 01:47:08.541
-Maybe you should make the wish.
-Yes.

1757
01:47:08.625 --> 01:47:10.666
-All right.
-Oh!

1758
01:47:10.750 --> 01:47:12.708
Excuse me.
I must defend my honor.

1759
01:47:12.791 --> 01:47:14.458
-I declare a do-over!
-I'll go deal with that.

1760
01:47:14.541 --> 01:47:16.375
-Here. Let me help you.
-Yes. of course.

1761
01:47:16.458 --> 01:47:17.625
I'm coming too!

1762
01:47:19.291 --> 01:47:21.166
-Got you!

1763
01:47:33.208 --> 01:47:34.583
What was that for?

1764
01:47:34.666 --> 01:47:36.125
-I just love you.
-Mmm.

1765
01:47:36.208 --> 01:47:38.583
