00:19:28.512 --> 00:19:31.929
Just let me tag team
with you on that.

360
00:19:31.929 --> 00:19:33.033
- I'm good.

361
00:19:33.033 --> 00:19:34.173
The day I need help to satisfy

362
00:19:34.173 --> 00:19:35.657
the person I'm in bed with.

363
00:19:35.657 --> 00:19:37.141
I'll join a monastery.

364
00:19:37.141 --> 00:19:39.039
Besides. you won't
catch my underwear

365
00:19:39.039 --> 00:19:41.041
next to a trophy case.

366
00:19:41.041 --> 00:19:42.284
- No.

367
00:19:42.284 --> 00:19:43.596
I wouldn't do that to you.

368
00:19:45.701 --> 00:19:48.704
- Nikki. you still
trying to play or what?

369
00:19:48.704 --> 00:19:50.706
- Yeah. it's on my to do list.

370
00:19:50.706 --> 00:19:53.813
- Oh. you tryin' to
join a bougie club. huh?

371
00:19:53.813 --> 00:19:55.021
Oh. you gonna have to max out

372
00:19:55.021 --> 00:19:57.748
your pop's credit
card for all of that.

373
00:19:57.748 --> 00:19:58.749
- Uh-uh.

374
00:19:58.749 --> 00:20:00.129
No need for all that.

375
00:20:00.129 --> 00:20:02.477
I have persuasive
talents of my own.

376
00:20:02.477 --> 00:20:06.032
- Just like you and every
other woman on this campus.

377
00:20:06.032 --> 00:20:07.240
- I don't know about the others.

378
00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.449
but I don't need anyone
to open doors for me.

379
00:20:11.486 --> 00:20:12.797
- Bullshit. man.

380
00:20:14.558 --> 00:20:15.800
- Think I'm playin'?

381
00:20:17.561 --> 00:20:19.148
- Listen. I'm just sayin'.

382
00:20:19.148 --> 00:20:20.357
You got a better chance

383
00:20:20.357 --> 00:20:21.772
of smashing the
most popular dude

384
00:20:21.772 --> 00:20:23.774
on campus for all that.

385
00:20:23.774 --> 00:20:25.603
- No need for all that.

386
00:20:25.603 --> 00:20:27.226
Not my type of crowd anyway.

387
00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:29.193
Besides. you won't catch
me getting knocked down

388
00:20:29.193 --> 00:20:31.368
like some drum
line or something.

389
00:20:31.368 --> 00:20:33.232
- Aight. you say that now.

390
00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:36.235
but if the opportunity arose.

391
00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:38.133
I guarantee you
you'd grab onto it.

392
00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:42.413
I'm just being serious.

393
00:20:42.413 --> 00:20:45.244
Look. we all know it
ain't always about

394
00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:46.900
what you know to get yourself

395
00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.385
through that door.

396
00:20:48.385 --> 00:20:50.007
For sure. how you
think most them girls

397
00:20:50.007 --> 00:20:51.767
got them high paying jobs?

398
00:20:51.767 --> 00:20:53.252
We know it ain't the smarts.

399
00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:55.530
For real.

400
00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:56.531
'Cause I know for
sure all them girls

401
00:20:56.531 --> 00:20:58.257
don't have a 3.8 GPA.

403
00:21:04.884 --> 00:21:09.268

Always.

408
00:21:14.031 --> 00:21:17.276
- I'm about to go smoke man.

409
00:21:17.276 --> 00:21:20.279
- How many fights you gonna
keep getting into. man?

410
00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:21.901
- I don't wanna
talk about it man.

00:21:21.901 --> 00:21:23.903
- Jesus Christ. man.
what's going on?

412
00:21:23.903 --> 00:21:25.422
- Man. what's up with those two?

413
00:21:25.422 --> 00:21:27.424
- Man. you know. their usual.

414
00:21:28.839 --> 00:21:30.047
- Man. that dude just
needs to give it up. man.

415
00:21:30.047 --> 00:21:32.049
Didn't he just get
out of a relationship?

416
00:21:32.049 --> 00:21:33.844
- Look. we all know
he been liking Nikki

417
00:21:33.844 --> 00:21:34.948
since high school. bro.

418
00:21:34.948 --> 00:21:36.881
Man. just consistent. bro.

419
00:21:36.881 --> 00:21:38.607
you know that's all it is.

420
00:21:38.607 --> 00:21:40.057
- Yeah. I hear you.

421
00:21:40.057 --> 00:21:42.370
but we all gotta catch
hell every once in a while.

422
00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:43.232
Except for me.

[door closing]

424
00:21:45.649 --> 00:21:46.477
- What up. what up.

425
00:21:46.477 --> 00:21:47.409
- What's up with you?

426
00:21:49.929 --> 00:21:51.310
- Karey bringing it.

427
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.345
- Karey. unh!

428
00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:58.317
Hey. but look. I'm
not gonna lie. man.

429
00:21:58.317 --> 00:22:00.664
I honestly think
that Nikki might be

430
00:22:00.664 --> 00:22:02.735
on the sweet side. bro.

431
00:22:02.735 --> 00:22:04.357
- Really?

432
00:22:04.357 --> 00:22:05.220
- Really?

433
00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:06.221
Like when the last time

434
00:22:06.221 --> 00:22:07.947
you ever see her with a man?

435
00:22:07.947 --> 00:22:09.431
And then on top of that.

436
00:22:09.431 --> 00:22:10.639
we not fixing to say oh.
it's because she's bougie

437
00:22:10.639 --> 00:22:12.814
as to why she can't get one.

438
00:22:13.987 --> 00:22:16.783
- I mean. maybe that's
just what she likes.

439
00:22:16.783 --> 00:22:18.613
- Yeah. I guess so. bro.

440
00:22:18.613 --> 00:22:20.131
- Well. I mean for now.

441
00:22:20.131 --> 00:22:21.409
I just don't think
that a woman can say

442
00:22:21.409 --> 00:22:22.375
that she doesn't like something

443
00:22:22.375 --> 00:22:24.515
that's she's never had.

444
00:22:24.515 --> 00:22:25.827
- Of course they can.

445
00:22:27.104 --> 00:22:28.450
- I doubt it.

446
00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:29.693
- Oh. really.

447
00:22:29.693 --> 00:22:31.142
- Okay. so have you
ever taken six inches

448
00:22:31.142 --> 00:22:33.041
from another man?

449
00:22:33.041 --> 00:22:34.456
- Hell. no. what the
hell I look like?

450
00:22:34.456 --> 00:22:35.664
- Oh. okay.

451
00:22:35.664 --> 00:22:36.596
So what makes you so sure

452
00:22:36.596 --> 00:22:38.736
that you wouldn't like it?

453
00:22:38.736 --> 00:22:40.669
- Hell. you trippin'.

454
00:22:40.669 --> 00:22:43.120
Look. I could say
the same for you.

455
00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.466
- You very well could.

456
00:22:45.605 --> 00:22:47.642
- Here y'all go again.

457
00:22:47.642 --> 00:22:48.574
- Man. what's you trying to say?

458
00:22:48.574 --> 00:22:49.885
- I'm just sayin'.

459
00:22:49.885 --> 00:22:51.231
If y'all gonna be
in here. you know.

460
00:22:51.231 --> 00:22:52.267
with the ruthlessness

461
00:22:52.267 --> 00:22:53.924
and the recklessness.

462
00:22:53.924 --> 00:22:54.959
I might as well. you know.

463
00:22:54.959 --> 00:22:56.167
have another come up.

464
00:22:56.167 --> 00:22:57.410
You know what I'm saying.

465
00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:58.446
I might as well just go
ahead and quit my job

466
00:22:58.446 --> 00:22:59.895
and live off y'all.

467
00:22:59.895 --> 00:23:01.380
- Listen. all I'm
trying to say is

468
00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:02.864
I don't think that a woman

469
00:23:02.864 --> 00:23:04.383
that's never had
a good six inches

470
00:23:04.383 --> 00:23:07.386
in her life can say that
she doesn't want something

471
00:23:07.386 --> 00:23:09.353
that she's never had.

472
00:23:11.493 --> 00:23:12.839

Mm. mm. mm.

484

- Yeah. you can say that again.

485

- [Tommy] You could say.
hey. man. chill out.

of shawties you wanna

accept virgins. right?

have any holes

right for saying that.

had something good
anyway. right?

508

- I guess.

509
00:24:55.459 --> 00:24:57.979
- Something good as
in long and thick?

510
00:24:57.979 --> 00:25:00.913
- Well. I guess that
means you're disqualified.

511
00:25:00.913 --> 00:25:02.121
- Now I know I don't need

512

to bust out my photo album.

I'll be sure to pull
my track record. too.

515
00:25:06.781 --> 00:25:08.092
so we can compare the two.

- Yeah. let's do that.

517
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:12.683
So we can see that clearly.

518
00:25:12.683 --> 00:25:14.927
your track record
doesn't compare to mine.

519
00:25:17.274 --> 00:25:18.931
- You're right.
you know I prefer

520
00:25:18.931 --> 00:25:20.208
to wake up to a dime.

521
00:25:20.208 --> 00:25:21.312
rather than the fours and fives

522

that you like to pull.

523
00:25:22.521 --> 00:25:24.488
Clearly one of mine
is worth 10 of yours.

525
00:25:26.455 --> 00:25:27.526
to take the throne.

526
00:25:27.526 --> 00:25:28.492
- I mean. I'm just saying.

527
00:25:28.492 --> 00:25:30.149
It takes a woman to know a woman

528
00:25:30.149 --> 00:25:31.599
and since I know women.

529
00:25:31.599 --> 00:25:33.532
I have a better chance
at making history

530
00:25:33.532 --> 00:25:34.498
than any man would.

531
00:25:36.604 --> 00:25:39.434
- You trying to bet
something on that.

532
00:25:39.434 --> 00:25:40.711
- You already know.
I ain't never run

533
00:25:40.711 --> 00:25:42.023
from the competition.

00:25:42.023 --> 00:25:43.369
- Well. shoot. let's go ahead

535
00:25:43.369 --> 00:25:44.301
and get it poppin' then.

00:40:17.242 --> 00:40:20.141
- I mean. nothing
much. it's all good.

898
00:40:20.141 --> 00:40:21.936
- Man. quit bullshitting.

899
00:40:21.936 --> 00:40:23.524
you know what I'm talking about.

900
00:40:26.182 --> 00:40:27.701
She is cool or whatever.

901
00:40:27.701 --> 00:40:30.289
but you might want to tell
her to chill a little bit.

902
00:40:31.463 --> 00:40:32.913
- I mean. she does
have a little bit

903
00:40:32.913 --> 00:40:34.397
of a jealousy thing going on.

904
00:40:34.397 --> 00:40:36.710
but it's not that bad.

905
00:40:39.333 --> 00:40:40.127
- You sure?

906
00:40:41.335 --> 00:40:42.612
Don't let things
get outta control.

907
00:40:42.612 --> 00:40:43.924
Next thing you know.
she gonna be tapping

908
00:40:43.924 --> 00:40:46.374
your phone like old
girl did on "Power."

909
00:40:46.374 --> 00:40:47.962
No need to worry about that.

910
00:40:49.101 --> 00:40:50.068
Yeah. aight.

911
00:40:53.002 --> 00:40:54.693
- What's going on?

912
00:40:54.693 --> 00:40:56.384
- That's my cue.

913
00:40:56.384 --> 00:40:57.800
- [Karey] Your cue?

914
00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:02.701
- Yeah. I smell
grits. eggs. bacon.

915
00:41:05.911 --> 00:41:07.050
with a touch of syrup.

916
00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:08.051
- You greedy.

917
00:41:08.051 --> 00:41:11.158
- Yeah. aight.
- Yeah. aight.

918
00:41:11.158 --> 00:41:12.090
- Let's go.

919
00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:13.436
- Good morning. Ms. Gill.

920
00:41:13.436 --> 00:41:15.127
Sure smells good in here.

921
00:41:15.127 --> 00:41:16.439
You got croissants. too?

922
00:41:17.336 --> 00:41:18.579
- Hey. Ron.

923
00:41:18.579 --> 00:41:20.098
By the looks of it.
you look like you need

924
00:41:20.098 --> 00:41:22.134
a home cooked meal.

925
00:41:22.134 --> 00:41:23.791
How is everything?

926
00:41:23.791 --> 00:41:24.999
- You can sure say that again.

927
00:41:24.999 --> 00:41:27.450
But. you know.
same old same old.

928
00:41:28.969 --> 00:41:30.246
- I hear that you
are on your way

929
00:41:30.246 --> 00:41:32.800
to getting a full
ride in grad school.

930
00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:33.939
- Yeah.

931
00:41:33.939 --> 00:41:35.182
It looks like that.

932
00:41:35.182 --> 00:41:36.908
I just gotta close this deal.

933
00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:44.191
- Still playing poker. I see.

934
00:41:45.503 --> 00:41:47.677
- [Ronnie] Yeah.
something like that.

935
00:41:47.677 --> 00:41:50.853
- Maybe you just
need to find a way

936
00:41:50.853 --> 00:41:51.923
to stay outta trouble.

937
00:41:52.993 --> 00:41:54.304
- Mm.

938
00:41:54.304 --> 00:41:56.306
I mean. I don't really
have to look very far

939
00:41:56.306 --> 00:41:57.894
because where I'm from.

940
00:41:57.894 --> 00:41:59.413
trouble seems to find me.

941
00:42:01.449 --> 00:42:02.899
- Why is that every
black man's excuse

942
00:42:02.899 --> 00:42:04.901
that come from the hood?

943
00:42:04.901 --> 00:42:05.971
- Maybe because that's where

944
00:42:05.971 --> 00:42:07.835
all the trouble resides.

945
00:42:10.217 --> 00:42:12.219
- You know. I could
probably pull some strings

946
00:42:12.219 --> 00:42:13.600
for you at my job.

947
00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:15.015
We can use someone like you.

948
00:42:16.292 --> 00:42:17.845
- Me?

949
00:42:17.845 --> 00:42:20.123
Working a traditional
nine to five?

950
00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:22.263
For minimum wage?

951
00:42:23.126 --> 00:42:25.163
Ah. you see. me going that route

952
00:42:25.163 --> 00:42:27.821
is exactly what's gonna
keep me in the hood.

953
00:42:30.513 --> 00:42:31.721
- That sounds a whole lot better

954
00:42:31.721 --> 00:42:33.033
than gambling your life away

955
00:42:33.033 --> 00:42:34.690
for a few poker chips.

956
00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:39.142
- Ms. Gill. believe me.

957
00:42:39.142 --> 00:42:41.075
It's never just a
few poker chips.

958
00:42:43.284 --> 00:42:44.389
- Anyways.

959
00:42:44.389 --> 00:42:45.632
How's your grandma doing?

960
00:42:46.943 --> 00:42:48.669
- She's doing pretty good.

961
00:42:48.669 --> 00:42:50.153
How about yourself?

962
00:42:50.153 --> 00:42:53.985
- Well. outside of
these god awful hours.

963
00:42:53.985 --> 00:42:54.848
everything's fine.

964
00:42:59.784 --> 00:43:00.716
- You look like you can use

965
00:43:00.716 --> 00:43:01.889
a little stress reliever.

966
00:43:01.889 --> 00:43:04.512
[Ms. Gill laughing]

967
00:43:04.512 --> 00:43:05.790
- If by drinking that poison

968
00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:07.895
that you like to dive into.

969
00:43:07.895 --> 00:43:10.035
I'm think I'm a take rain check.

970
00:43:11.174 --> 00:43:12.555
- That's not even
what I mean. Ms. Gill.

971
00:43:12.555 --> 00:43:13.798
I'm just saying I think

972
00:43:13.798 --> 00:43:15.834
that you should get out
of the house sometimes.

973
00:43:15.834 --> 00:43:20.321
You know. going to
God's house is great.

974
00:43:21.495 --> 00:43:22.703
I mean. it's awesome.
but at the same time

975
00:43:22.703 --> 00:43:24.981
I know you wanna
create some memories

976
00:43:24.981 --> 00:43:27.363
that you can share
with your grandchildren

977
00:43:27.363 --> 00:43:28.571
once they start coming.

978
00:43:29.952 --> 00:43:34.508
I mean. what's a life without
exciting stories to tell?

979
00:43:34.508 --> 00:43:35.751
Not a life at all. really.

980
00:43:35.751 --> 00:43:38.339
- You know what. that's
my cue. how 'bout that?

981
00:43:38.339 --> 00:43:39.962
I'm a holler at you.

982
00:43:39.962 --> 00:43:41.239
Aight.
- Aight.

983
00:43:45.001 --> 00:43:46.589
- You right.

984
00:43:46.589 --> 00:43:48.108
But the way my child is going.

985
00:43:49.557 --> 00:43:51.767
I don't look for anything
like that anytime soon.

986
00:43:51.767 --> 00:43:53.389
- Yeah. I know what you mean.

987
00:43:53.389 --> 00:43:54.597
but maybe that's something

988
00:43:54.597 --> 00:43:56.530
you should talk to her about.

989
00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:59.084
Although I know it probably
won't do very much good.

990
00:44:00.396 --> 00:44:01.846
- I'm not gonna waste my time.

991
00:44:02.778 --> 00:44:03.606
This.

992
00:44:05.573 --> 00:44:07.368
Is all I need.

993
00:44:07.368 --> 00:44:09.647
- I cannot argue with you there.

994
00:44:11.338 --> 00:44:12.580
Nah. seriously. though.

995
00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:15.100
You need to get
out of the house.

996
00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:18.310
As a matter of fact.
I'm gonna take you out.

997
00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:21.451
- I'm not so sure about that.

998
00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:25.663
- Why. you ain't got
nothing else to do.

999
00:44:31.254 --> 00:44:32.290
- Okay.

1000
00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:33.705
Why not?

1001
00:44:33.705 --> 00:44:35.811
When and where are we going?

1002
00:44:35.811 --> 00:44:37.295
- Listen. don't you
worry about that.

1003
00:44:37.295 --> 00:44:39.366
You just make sure you
don't flake on me tonight.

1004
00:44:40.816 --> 00:44:43.853
- Mister. you have
yourself a deal.

1005
00:44:43.853 --> 00:44:45.061
Let me get you a plate.

1006
00:44:45.061 --> 00:44:47.408
- See. now that's what
I'm talking about.

1007
00:44:47.408 --> 00:44:49.617
A couple of them
croissants up there.

1008
00:44:49.617 --> 00:44:52.620
[upbeat funk music]

1009
00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:01.975
- Yo. Ron. where you at man?

1010
00:45:01.975 --> 00:45:03.217
Call me back.

1011
00:45:04.978 --> 00:45:07.256
- Oh. I didn't expect
to find you here.

1012
00:45:07.256 --> 00:45:09.051
- Uh. well. last time I checked

1013
00:45:09.051 --> 00:45:11.087
it is our place of
higher learning. right.

1014
00:45:11.087 --> 00:45:12.537
- I know that. but
I didn't expect

1015
00:45:12.537 --> 00:45:13.365
to see you.

1016
00:45:13.365 --> 00:45:14.850
- Well. here I am.

1017
00:45:17.335 --> 00:45:19.889
- Looks like you got your
eyes on something else.

1018
00:45:19.889 --> 00:45:20.821
- Huh?

1019
00:45:20.821 --> 00:45:23.099
Oh. I mean. something like that.

1020
00:45:25.274 --> 00:45:26.447
- [Flex] Want me
to introduce you.

1021
00:45:26.447 --> 00:45:27.966
- Introduce me?

1022
00:45:27.966 --> 00:45:30.486
What makes you think I
need any introduction?

1023
00:45:30.486 --> 00:45:33.178
- Sweat beating down
your face. that's all.

1024
00:45:33.178 --> 00:45:35.629
Besides it's that that
time of season anyway.

1025
00:45:35.629 --> 00:45:36.664
- Which is?

1026
00:45:36.664 --> 00:45:37.493
- Cuffin' season.

1027
00:45:39.633 --> 00:45:42.947
Look I'm just messing
with you. come on.

1028
00:45:46.226 --> 00:45:48.815
You keep your head
in the books all day?

1029
00:45:48.815 --> 00:45:49.988
- Of course.

1030
00:45:49.988 --> 00:45:51.990
Gotta keep them
grades up to compete.

1031
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:54.648
Besides. there ain't much
to look at until now.

1032
00:45:54.648 --> 00:45:55.614
- Just trying to run game.

1033
00:45:55.614 --> 00:45:56.754
If you really felt that way.

1034
00:45:56.754 --> 00:45:58.238
we coulda been
skipped small talk.

1035
00:45:58.238 --> 00:46:00.205
- That's what I'm doing.

1036
00:46:00.205 --> 00:46:01.828
Besides. who said I
was talking about you?

1037
00:46:01.828 --> 00:46:03.761
- Oh. it's like that. huh?
- Mm-hmm.

1038
00:46:03.761 --> 00:46:06.280
- It's all right. you'd
be missing out anyway.

1039
00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:07.385
Anyhow. this is-

1040
00:46:07.385 --> 00:46:08.593
- Karey.

1041
00:46:08.593 --> 00:46:09.421
- Yeah.

1042
00:46:10.388 --> 00:46:12.183
- [Woman] I know who she is.

1043
00:46:12.183 --> 00:46:14.357
- Is that a good thing or bad?

1044
00:46:14.357 --> 00:46:16.256
- Well. it depends
on your performance

1045
00:46:16.256 --> 00:46:19.155
and behavior to see if
you confirm the rumors.

1046
00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:24.126
- That's my cue.

1047
00:46:24.126 --> 00:46:25.299
I'm a catch y'all later.

1048
00:46:31.202 --> 00:46:33.687
- So. what's your major?

1049
00:46:33.687 --> 00:46:35.309
- Psychology.

1050
00:46:35.309 --> 00:46:36.241
- Oh. yeah.

1051
00:46:36.241 --> 00:46:38.002
So you're trying to be...

1052
00:46:38.002 --> 00:46:39.727
- A family psychologist.

1053
00:46:39.727 --> 00:46:41.419
- What made you pick that major?

1054
00:46:42.627 --> 00:46:43.835
- Well. I like to
work with children

1055
00:46:43.835 --> 00:46:47.011
and families and my
upbringing wasn't

1056
00:46:47.011 --> 00:46:48.806
in the best of environments.

1057
00:46:48.806 --> 00:46:50.808
so this is my way
of giving back.

1058
00:46:52.223 --> 00:46:53.086
So what about you?

1059
00:46:53.086 --> 00:46:54.018
What's your major?

1060
00:46:54.018 --> 00:46:55.536
- I'm majoring in pre-med

1061
00:46:55.536 --> 00:46:56.952
with a minor in economics.

1062
00:46:56.952 --> 00:46:58.332
- Okay.

1063
00:46:58.332 --> 00:47:00.127
Because?

1064
00:47:00.127 --> 00:47:01.853
- Well. as far as the
economics part goes.

1065
00:47:01.853 --> 00:47:03.682
I mean. I like numbers.

1066
00:47:03.682 --> 00:47:05.719
I'm pretty good
with calculation.

1067
00:47:05.719 --> 00:47:09.999
- So I take it you're always
weighing a risk and what not?

1068
00:47:09.999 --> 00:47:11.863
- Yeah. something like that.

1069
00:47:11.863 --> 00:47:13.865
- So is that why you
like to play poker?

1070
00:47:14.866 --> 00:47:16.592
- You done your homework I see.

1071
00:47:16.592 --> 00:47:18.318
- You could say that.

1072
00:47:19.629 --> 00:47:22.184
So. I hear you're
quite the player.

1073
00:47:22.184 --> 00:47:23.185

00:55:33.709 --> 00:55:35.332
- Terry from the Gammas?

1252
00:55:35.332 --> 00:55:36.263
- Yeah.

1253
00:55:36.263 --> 00:55:37.472
She's the one. y'all.

1254
00:55:37.472 --> 00:55:38.404
- Ooh.

1255
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:42.235
You might as well fuck
Beyonce. too while you at it.

1256
00:55:42.235 --> 00:55:43.616
- Oh. please believe.

1257
00:55:43.616 --> 00:55:44.858
she's somewhere on a list. too.

1258
00:55:44.858 --> 00:55:46.101
Don't get it twisted.

1259
00:55:46.101 --> 00:55:47.620
- Okay.

1260
00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:48.862
What happened to Shelley?

1261
00:55:50.036 --> 00:55:52.728
- Man. I just can't deal
with that whiny type.

1262
00:55:52.728 --> 00:55:54.937
Not to mention the
stalker type either.

1263
00:55:54.937 --> 00:55:57.595
And besides. that
extra thousand dollars

1264
00:55:57.595 --> 00:56:00.080
is gonna have my resume
looking real nice.

1265
00:56:01.116 --> 00:56:02.497
- I don't know about all that.

1266
00:56:02.497 --> 00:56:04.395
- What's that supposed to mean?

1267
00:56:04.395 --> 00:56:06.535
- It means he doesn't
think you and Ronnie

1268
00:56:06.535 --> 00:56:10.608
both were serious about
this bet y'all got going on.

1269
00:56:10.608 --> 00:56:11.816
- Why wouldn't we be?

1270
00:56:11.816 --> 00:56:14.025
- I mean. 'cause y'all
old friends. like.

1271
00:56:14.025 --> 00:56:16.338
we don't want y'all
fiending over some money.

1272
00:56:16.338 --> 00:56:17.166
you feel me?

1273
00:56:17.166 --> 00:56:18.167
At the same time.

1274
00:56:18.167 --> 00:56:19.997
you need to definitely watch out

1275
00:56:19.997 --> 00:56:21.481
for that little
Gamma that you got.

1276
00:56:21.481 --> 00:56:23.380
'cause you know what they
say about those Gammas.

1277
00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:25.243
They always turn people out.

1278
00:56:25.243 --> 00:56:26.900
- Yeah. honestly.
you might as well

1279
00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:29.178
just join the organization.

1280
00:56:29.178 --> 00:56:30.801
- Oh. hell. no. that
is not my thing.

1281
00:56:30.801 --> 00:56:32.492
- What's wrong with
pledging a sorority?

1282
00:56:32.492 --> 00:56:34.080
- I didn't say nothing
was wrong with it.

1283
00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:35.495
I just see them
hos as the uppity

1284
00:56:35.495 --> 00:56:37.532
and bougie type. that's all.

1285
00:56:37.532 --> 00:56:39.188
- Speaking of bougie.

1286
00:56:39.188 --> 00:56:40.258
What's up Nikki.

1287
00:56:40.258 --> 00:56:41.812
- Not a damn thing.

1288
00:56:42.744 --> 00:56:44.539
- How's the search going Nikki?

1289
00:56:44.539 --> 00:56:45.747
- Tough.

1290
00:56:45.747 --> 00:56:47.438
I still have to write
an entrance letter

1291
00:56:47.438 --> 00:56:49.406
and I haven't even
gotten a mentor yet.

1292
00:56:49.406 --> 00:56:51.649
- What. you better
talk to Karey.

1293
00:56:51.649 --> 00:56:52.823
She got the plug already.

1294
00:56:52.823 --> 00:56:53.651
- Really?

1295
00:56:54.549 --> 00:56:55.446
- For sho'.

1296
00:56:56.827 --> 00:56:59.036

- So who is she?

1300
00:57:05.283 --> 00:57:07.113
- Terry Williamson.

1301
00:57:07.113 --> 00:57:08.183
- Okay.

1302
00:57:08.183 --> 00:57:09.495
What?

1303
00:57:09.495 --> 00:57:13.568
Okay. roll up. so you
tryna fuck her. right.

1304
00:57:13.568 --> 00:57:15.846
- Something like that.
something like that.

1305
00:57:15.846 --> 00:57:17.917
- Well. you better get in line

1306
00:57:17.917 --> 00:57:20.782
'cause many have
tried and failed.

1307
00:57:20.782 --> 00:57:21.783
- Okay. well. it sounds like

1308
00:57:21.783 --> 00:57:22.715
you been hanging around

1309
00:57:22.715 --> 00:57:24.475
with a bunch of losers to me.

1310
00:57:24.475 --> 00:57:26.063
- Doesn't say much about y'all.

1311
00:57:27.029 --> 00:57:28.306
- Know what. whatever.

1312
00:57:28.306 --> 00:57:29.653
What y'all getting
into this weekend?

1313
00:57:29.653 --> 00:57:31.240
- You know me. man.

1314
00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:33.173
like I'm a be just chillin' out.

1315
00:57:33.173 --> 00:57:34.934
Prolly at the bowling
alley or something.

1316
00:57:34.934 --> 00:57:37.454
- Yeah. I got a shawtie
I'm tryna to meet

1317
00:57:37.454 --> 00:57:40.664
after this interest
meeting for the Gammas.

1318
00:57:40.664 --> 00:57:41.492
- Wait.

1319
00:57:42.528 --> 00:57:43.598
Interest meeting.

1320
00:57:43.598 --> 00:57:45.358
They had an interest meeting.

1321
00:57:45.358 --> 00:57:47.325
- Yeah. it's about that time.

1322
00:57:47.325 --> 00:57:48.154
You know.

1323
00:57:48.154 --> 00:57:49.155
Why. are you interested?

1324
00:57:49.155 --> 00:57:50.570
- Oh. no.

1325
00:57:50.570 --> 00:57:53.331
Not my crowd. I just
didn't know how it worked.

1326
00:57:53.331 --> 00:57:55.402
- Basically what happens is

1327
00:57:56.507 --> 00:57:58.509
they have an interest
meeting every year

1328
00:57:58.509 --> 00:58:01.616
and. you know. they have
the girls come out there

1329
00:58:01.616 --> 00:58:04.032
and stuff like that
and you know how

1330
00:58:04.032 --> 00:58:04.860
they be looking.

1331
00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:05.792
- Yeah. yeah.

1332
00:58:05.792 --> 00:58:07.000
- And then they go in there

1333
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.243
and they think that
they. you know.

1334
00:58:08.243 --> 00:58:09.486
got a fair shot. but
they really don't.

1335
00:58:09.486 --> 00:58:10.694
They already know who
it is that they picking

1336
00:58:10.694 --> 00:58:12.765
before they even bring
the girls out there. so.

1337
00:58:13.628 --> 00:58:14.870
You should go down there

1338
00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:16.389
and see what's up.
it may benefit you.

1339
00:58:16.389 --> 00:58:18.425
- Oh. no. no uh-uh.

1340
00:58:18.425 --> 00:58:20.635
this is not my
type of thing. so.

1341
00:58:20.635 --> 00:58:23.707
but anyway. I'm gonna get going

1342
00:58:23.707 --> 00:58:26.192
and I'll see you guys later.

1343
00:58:26.192 --> 00:58:27.642
Peace.

1344
00:58:27.642 --> 00:58:28.815
- Aight. yeah.

1345
00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:33.993
[upbeat funk music]

1346
00:58:39.861 --> 00:58:42.415
- Good evening madam.

1347
00:58:42.415 --> 00:58:44.382
- Thank you. but
I'm not interested.

1348
00:58:44.382 --> 00:58:45.522
I have a boyfriend.

1349
00:58:45.522 --> 00:58:46.384
- Boyfriend?

1350
00:58:46.384 --> 00:58:47.420
No. it's not like that.

1351
00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:48.904
I was trying to invite you.

1352
00:58:48.904 --> 00:58:51.148
- Okay. let me stop
you right there.

1353
00:58:51.148 --> 00:58:52.356
I don't mean to be rude.

1354
00:58:52.356 --> 00:58:55.324
but I just don't have
any time to spend.

1355
00:58:55.324 --> 00:58:56.636
- Well. it's not like that.

1356
00:58:56.636 --> 00:58:58.362
What I wanted to do
was invite you out

1357
00:58:58.362 --> 00:59:00.433
to our church services
tomorrow night.

1358
00:59:00.433 --> 00:59:01.641
We'll have an
interesting meeting

1359
00:59:01.641 --> 00:59:02.884
for anyone that
may be interested

1360
00:59:02.884 --> 00:59:04.989
in going on a free trip to Korea

1361
00:59:04.989 --> 00:59:06.543
to help tutor some kids.

1362
00:59:07.751 --> 00:59:08.890
- Oh.

1363
00:59:08.890 --> 00:59:09.787
Okay.

1364
00:59:09.787 --> 00:59:11.237
Well. sorry.

1365
00:59:12.790 --> 00:59:14.965
I just don't really
do the church thing

1366
00:59:14.965 --> 00:59:18.209
and I've kind of had my
fair share of fake people.

1367
00:59:19.314 --> 00:59:20.591
- I completely understand.

1368
00:59:20.591 --> 00:59:21.937
but if you change your mind.

1369
00:59:21.937 --> 00:59:23.663
don't hesitate to stop by.

1370
00:59:25.113 --> 00:59:25.941
- Thanks.

1371
00:59:25.941 --> 00:59:27.529
But. no thanks.

1372
00:59:48.308 --> 00:59:49.931
- There's no need to be ashamed.

1373
00:59:49.931 --> 00:59:51.449
I could've happened to anyone.

1374
00:59:53.141 --> 00:59:54.314
So who were those guys?

1375
00:59:56.662 --> 00:59:59.181
- Just some dudes I know
from around the way.

1376
01:00:00.458 --> 01:00:01.908
- I can see that.

1377
01:00:01.908 --> 01:00:03.116
The question is
which around the way

1378
01:00:03.116 --> 01:00:04.428
have you been mingling in?

1379
01:00:06.430 --> 01:00:08.881
- I mean it's not
really hard to tell.

1380
01:00:08.881 --> 01:00:10.054
You see where I stay.

1381
01:00:11.124 --> 01:00:14.472
- You ever thought about moving?

1382
01:00:14.472 --> 01:00:15.301
- Moving.

1383
01:00:17.544 --> 01:00:18.442
Of course I have.

1384
01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:21.341
But I haven't exactly
been in a situation

1385
01:00:21.341 --> 01:00:24.586
where I'm able to just
up and leave. you know.

1386
01:00:25.829 --> 01:00:27.589
- Sounds more like
an excuse to me.

1387
01:00:29.315 --> 01:00:31.144
What you expect me to say?

1388
01:00:31.144 --> 01:00:32.214
That I understand.

1389
01:00:33.388 --> 01:00:34.320
At the end of the
day. the only thing

1390
01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:36.115
that matters is the end result.

1391
01:00:36.115 --> 01:00:37.357
You can't tell me
that you're willing

1392
01:00:37.357 --> 01:00:39.256
to risk your earnings
to play poker.

1393
01:00:39.256 --> 01:00:41.120
but too scared to
move outta the hood.

1394
01:00:46.125 --> 01:00:47.644
- You're right about one thing.

1395
01:00:48.541 --> 01:00:49.646
I am lucky.

1396
01:00:51.199 --> 01:00:52.269
But it doesn't really look like

1397
01:00:52.269 --> 01:00:53.650
I'm having much of a choice

1398
01:00:54.927 --> 01:00:57.446
being that my rent
money was in that bag.

1399
01:00:57.446 --> 01:00:59.690
which I'm already two
months behind in paying.

1400
01:01:05.869 --> 01:01:07.353
Where'd you bring me anyways?

1401
01:01:08.526 --> 01:01:09.804
- A place that's
a whole lot safer

1402
01:01:09.804 --> 01:01:11.288
than where you just came from.

1403
01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:16.051
- [Sorority Girl 1] So
who's next on the list?

1404
01:01:18.571 --> 01:01:20.331
- [Sorority Girl 2]
That's a cute picture.

1405
01:01:25.164 --> 01:01:28.512
- [Sorority Girl 1] I'm not
too impressed with that one.

1406
01:01:28.512 --> 01:01:29.582
- Okay.

1407
01:01:29.582 --> 01:01:31.895
We have Hederina George.

1408
01:01:31.895 --> 01:01:33.448
She's a major in
political science

1409
01:01:33.448 --> 01:01:34.863

the tradition of
Gammas in her family.

01:01:39.005 --> 01:01:40.835
She's been around
since she was four.

1413
01:01:40.835 --> 01:01:41.974
- Right.

1414
01:01:41.974 --> 01:01:43.838
- She has three
community service awards

1415
01:01:43.838 --> 01:01:45.874
through her church and...

1416
01:01:49.429 --> 01:01:51.224
Yeah. she has as
lot of good source..

1417
01:01:52.432 --> 01:01:54.849
- I don't know.
what do you think?

1418
01:01:54.849 --> 01:01:56.713
- I mean. it sounds
nice on paper.

1419
01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:58.784
but I don't know this chick.

1420
01:01:58.784 --> 01:02:00.475
- I haven't seen
her around anywhere.

1421
01:02:00.475 --> 01:02:01.994
- [Sorority Girl 2] Yeah. next.

1422
01:02:01.994 --> 01:02:05.929
- Well. right here we

1425
01:02:10.899 --> 01:02:15.524
She has a GPA of a 3.3 and
three letters of recommendation.

1426
01:02:15.524 --> 01:02:20.150
Says here she was an MVP from
last season of volleyball.

1427
01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:25.051
Her hobbies are working
out and swimming.

1428
01:02:26.397 --> 01:02:27.536
- Don't like that post.

1429
01:02:28.848 --> 01:02:29.780
Let me see.

1430
01:02:33.266 --> 01:02:34.095
Yeah.

1431
01:02:35.268 --> 01:02:37.477
I mean. have you seen
her around or anything?

1432
01:02:38.547 --> 01:02:40.722
- I mean. I've seen her around.

1433
01:02:40.722 --> 01:02:43.069
She acts like she's too
good and guess what?

1434
01:02:43.069 --> 01:02:44.277
- What?

1435
01:02:44.277 --> 01:02:46.072
- She hangs out
with Remy and Tommy.

1436
01:02:47.556 --> 01:02:49.317
- Wait. is she
that redhead chick?

1437
01:02:50.249 --> 01:02:51.526
Oh. my gosh.

1438
01:02:51.526 --> 01:02:52.769
I mean the only time
I've ever seen her

1439
01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:55.047
is when she's been
toe down at the club.

1440
01:02:55.047 --> 01:02:56.773
I mean. she does
stay on that side

1441
01:02:56.773 --> 01:02:58.119
if you know what I mean.

1442
01:02:58.119 --> 01:02:59.361
- Exactly.

1443
01:02:59.361 --> 01:03:00.949
And her resume isn't
even up to par.

1444
01:03:03.296 --> 01:03:04.228
- I mean does she have anything

1445
01:03:04.228 --> 01:03:05.954
through service at least?

1446
01:03:05.954 --> 01:03:07.473
I don't see it in here.

1447
01:03:09.302 --> 01:03:10.856
I don't know.

1448
01:03:10.856 --> 01:03:13.272
I mean more than
a GPA and an MVP.

1449
01:03:13.272 --> 01:03:14.514
- [Sorority Girl 1] Right.

1450
01:03:14.514 --> 01:03:15.722
- I mean if the only
time I'm gonna see

1451
01:03:15.722 --> 01:03:16.896
this chick is when
it's time to pregame.

1452
01:03:16.896 --> 01:03:18.484
that's a problem.

1453
01:03:20.003 --> 01:03:21.280
I mean it'd be nice

1454
01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:22.315
if we had someone
with a connection

1455
01:03:22.315 --> 01:03:23.558
to the church. you know.
- Exactly.

1456
01:03:23.558 --> 01:03:25.871
- Something useful.
but I don't know.

1457
01:03:25.871 --> 01:03:27.182
We can least put her
in the maybe pile

1458
01:03:27.182 --> 01:03:28.735
'cause at least she's pretty.

1459
01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:30.841
We put her in the maybe.

1460
01:03:30.841 --> 01:03:33.879
but right now I'm just...

1461
01:03:36.398 --> 01:03:37.814
- Good evening ladies.

1462
01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:41.541
Hi. I'm Nikki Tremaine.

1463
01:03:43.647 --> 01:03:45.166
Nice to meet you.

1464
01:03:45.166 --> 01:03:46.615
I just wanted to invite you guys

1465
01:03:46.615 --> 01:03:50.654
to a little event I'm
hosting at my church.

1466
01:03:50.654 --> 01:03:52.518
- Okay. what church.

1467
01:03:52.518 --> 01:03:54.865
It's right there.

1468
01:03:55.762 --> 01:03:57.523
- St. Matthews Church.

1469
01:03:57.523 --> 01:03:59.042
- [Nikki] That one. yes.

1470
01:03:59.042 --> 01:04:00.526
- And what exactly do you do?

1471
01:04:00.526 --> 01:04:03.667
- I am the event
coordinator there.

1472
01:04:03.667 --> 01:04:04.875
- Interesting.

1473
01:04:04.875 --> 01:04:06.014
I've never seen
you there before.

1474
01:04:06.014 --> 01:04:07.498
I've been there for three years

1475
01:04:07.498 --> 01:04:09.846
and you've never been around.

1476
01:04:09.846 --> 01:04:11.744
- Yes. well. with
all the partying

1477
01:04:11.744 --> 01:04:14.712
and studying done. I am now able

1478
01:04:14.712 --> 01:04:16.335
to give back to the community

1479
01:04:16.335 --> 01:04:19.062
and especially to the Lord.

1480
01:04:19.062 --> 01:04:20.235
- Can't argue with that.

1481
01:04:20.235 --> 01:04:22.065
- Anyhow. I just wanted
to invite you guys

1482
01:04:22.065 --> 01:04:23.238
to see if you
would be interested

1483
01:04:23.238 --> 01:04:26.034
in coming to support it.

1484
01:04:26.034 --> 01:04:28.761
- Okay. do you have
any extra flyers?

1485
01:04:28.761 --> 01:04:32.627
- No. that's my last
one. I'm so sorry.

1486
01:04:32.627 --> 01:04:34.491
But. it was nice
meeting you ladies

1487
01:04:34.491 --> 01:04:36.113
and I hope to see you there.

1488
01:04:36.113 --> 01:04:37.459
- Okay.

1489
01:04:37.459 --> 01:04:39.323
- Toodles.

1490
01:04:39.323 --> 01:04:41.670
- Can you believe her.
- I can't.

1491
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:43.293
- At least she's
connected to the church.

1492
01:04:43.293 --> 01:04:44.190
I'll give her that.

1493
01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:47.193
[upbeat funk music]

1494
01:05:07.938 --> 01:05:08.801
- Damn.

1495
01:05:09.733 --> 01:05:11.804
She thinker in a stickup.

1496
01:05:11.804 --> 01:05:13.668
- Boy. you ain't never lie.

1497
01:05:14.703 --> 01:05:15.981
Look at it.

1498
01:05:15.981 --> 01:05:18.604
- Let me see. zoom in. zoom in.

1499
01:05:18.604 --> 01:05:21.262
Ooh. whee. I gotta
give it to you K.

1500
01:05:21.262 --> 01:05:22.539
you pull this one off.

1501
01:05:22.539 --> 01:05:24.851
I'll have to call
you the real MVP.

1502
01:05:24.851 --> 01:05:28.407
- Look. don't let Ronnie
hear that. though.

1503
01:05:28.407 --> 01:05:29.995
- Yeah. look Ronnie
ain't gotta worry

1504
01:05:29.995 --> 01:05:32.204
about all that. you
know what I'm saying.

1505
01:05:32.204 --> 01:05:35.034
- Look. both of them
can get it either way.

1506
01:05:35.034 --> 01:05:37.140
As a matter of fact. hey. K.

1507
01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:39.107
can you put me on as
soon as you get it.

1508
01:05:39.107 --> 01:05:41.385
- Look. we'll see
about all that.

1509
01:05:41.385 --> 01:05:42.628
But as of right now.

1510
01:05:42.628 --> 01:05:44.561
I'm gonna have to
cuff this one y'all.

1511
01:05:44.561 --> 01:05:46.563
- Cuff. are you playing cuff?

1512
01:05:46.563 --> 01:05:47.702
Oh. you gonna love.

1513
01:05:47.702 --> 01:05:50.774
I never took you as the type.

1514
01:05:50.774 --> 01:05:52.155
- I don't know man.

1515
01:05:52.155 --> 01:05:54.295
this one's vibe just
seems different.

1516
01:05:54.295 --> 01:05:55.123
- Oh. different.

1517
01:05:55.123 --> 01:05:56.435
- So what is it?

1518
01:05:56.435 --> 01:05:58.644
It's the tits?

1519
01:05:58.644 --> 01:05:59.990
Nah. it's the thighs.

1520
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.749
- No. bruh. it's that ass.
- It's the ass.

1521
01:06:03.476 --> 01:06:05.375
- Negative. negative gentlemen.

1522
01:06:05.375 --> 01:06:07.377
Look. it's that smile
and that pretty face.

1523
01:06:07.377 --> 01:06:09.068
Just look at it. damn.

1524
01:06:09.068 --> 01:06:12.416
- What about fat
ass pussy print?

1525
01:06:15.902 --> 01:06:18.215
See. here I am thinking
you're damn day

1526
01:06:18.215 --> 01:06:20.493
is looking at my picture

1527
01:06:20.493 --> 01:06:22.047
and you about to leave
the floor looking

1528
01:06:22.047 --> 01:06:23.324
at the next bitch.

1529
01:06:23.324 --> 01:06:26.327
- Man. look at the
time. it's time to go.

1530
01:06:26.327 --> 01:06:27.328
Come on man. we gotta go.

1531
01:06:27.328 --> 01:06:28.985
- So you just gonna leave me.

1532
01:06:28.985 --> 01:06:29.882
- Catch you later. K.

1533
01:06:29.882 --> 01:06:30.987
- We both out.

1534
01:06:35.681 --> 01:06:36.923
- Really!

1535
01:06:36.923 --> 01:06:39.616
Look. I was just.
I was just looking.

1536
01:06:39.616 --> 01:06:42.170
- I see you telling
one half of the truth.

1537
01:06:42.170 --> 01:06:43.551
but the better question would be

1538
01:06:43.551 --> 01:06:44.931
are you fucking her?

1539
01:06:44.931 --> 01:06:46.623
- No. I'm not fucking her.

1540
01:06:48.211 --> 01:06:52.215
- By the way your face
is. I couldn't tell.

1541
01:06:52.215 --> 01:06:53.768
What happened to us hooking up?

1542
01:06:56.357 --> 01:06:58.324
- I just got caught
up on something.

1543
01:06:58.324 --> 01:06:59.291
- Like what?

1544
01:06:59.291 --> 01:07:00.913
Hanging over at Tommy's place?

1545
01:07:00.913 --> 01:07:03.398
Being here is more important
than hanging with me?

1546
01:07:06.229 --> 01:07:07.368
See.

1547
01:07:07.368 --> 01:07:09.025
That's what I'm talking about.

1548
01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:10.302
How you expect me to hold up

1549
01:07:10.302 --> 01:07:12.925
my end of things and be strong

1550
01:07:12.925 --> 01:07:14.409
when you can't even hold down

1551
01:07:14.409 --> 01:07:16.273
your end of the bargain.

1552
01:07:17.688 --> 01:07:18.931
You know what?

1553
01:07:18.931 --> 01:07:20.657
Do you even wanna
be with me anymore?

1554
01:07:23.418 --> 01:07:24.730
That's all I needed to know.

1555
01:07:24.730 --> 01:07:27.043
- Man. come on. stop being-

1556
01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:28.354
- Don't even waste my time.

1557
01:07:28.354 --> 01:07:30.149
Do you like her?

1558
01:07:30.149 --> 01:07:32.151
- Look. she's nobody.

1559
01:07:32.151 --> 01:07:33.014
Damn.

1560
01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:34.912
What?

1561
01:07:34.912 --> 01:07:35.741
- Really.

1562
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:40.677
- Ooh.

1563
01:07:40.677 --> 01:07:41.850
How you doing?

1564
01:07:43.404 --> 01:07:45.302
- Let me holler at her.

1565
01:07:51.412 --> 01:07:52.999
- What you doing here Addison?

1566
01:07:52.999 --> 01:07:55.036
- I was hoping we could talk.

1567
01:07:55.036 --> 01:07:56.106
- Talk?

1568
01:07:56.106 --> 01:07:57.176
Talk about what?

1569
01:07:57.176 --> 01:08:02.112
- Can we go somewhere quiet?

1570
01:08:02.733 --> 01:08:03.941
- Come on. man.

1571
01:08:09.982 --> 01:08:11.673
- I sure hope it's a
shower in this place

1572
01:08:11.673 --> 01:08:13.434
so I can clean myself.

1573
01:08:16.644 --> 01:08:20.096
Listen. for what it's worth.

1574
01:08:21.097 --> 01:08:22.546
I wanna say thank you because

1575
01:08:22.546 --> 01:08:25.170
you didn't have to do
what you did. but you did.

1576
01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:27.896
- I know your type.

1577
01:08:30.036 --> 01:08:31.314
- Really?

1578
01:08:31.314 --> 01:08:32.211
- Yeah. really.

1579
01:08:33.799 --> 01:08:35.076
- I guess I need to
work on my poker face

1580
01:08:35.076 --> 01:08:36.905
'cause it seems as
if a lot of people

1581
01:08:36.905 --> 01:08:39.494
got me figured out these days.

1582
01:08:39.494 --> 01:08:40.495
- Maybe you do.

1583
01:08:44.603 --> 01:08:45.742
- You know. I'm really surprised

1584
01:08:45.742 --> 01:08:48.193
to find a girl like you here.

1585
01:08:49.090 --> 01:08:49.918
- Why is that?

1586
01:08:51.230 --> 01:08:53.025
- You know I always took it

1587
01:08:53.025 --> 01:08:55.372
that you sorority
types were. you know.

1588
01:08:56.684 --> 01:08:58.651
uppity and rich.

1589
01:09:00.722 --> 01:09:02.828
- Well. for what it's worth.

1590
01:09:02.828 --> 01:09:04.105
not everything you hear about us

1591
01:09:04.105 --> 01:09:05.796
is entirely accurate.

1592
01:09:05.796 --> 01:09:08.144
We don't all come from
prestigious backgrounds.

1593
01:09:09.697 --> 01:09:10.905
- Sure had me fooled.

1594
01:09:12.286 --> 01:09:15.220
- But to be curious. what
do they say about us?

1595
01:09:16.566 --> 01:09:19.431
- You know. that
you're rich. stuck up

1596
01:09:19.431 --> 01:09:21.778
and you only associate yourself

1597
01:09:21.778 --> 01:09:23.228
with the purists.

1598
01:09:24.263 --> 01:09:25.230
- Define pure.

1599
01:09:27.646 --> 01:09:29.165
- Let's just say the type

1600
01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:33.376
that hasn't given up
their most precious asset.

1601
01:09:36.172 --> 01:09:37.621
- Well. you're close.

1602
01:09:38.657 --> 01:09:39.865
Most of us are pure

1603
01:09:41.038 --> 01:09:44.352
and some of us are stuck
up. but not all of us.

1604
01:09:46.423 --> 01:09:49.288
But yes. most of my
kind do have money.

1605
01:09:51.221 --> 01:09:52.084
- I figured.

1606
01:09:54.259 --> 01:09:56.882
So. how do you get your money?

1607
01:09:58.055 --> 01:10:00.023
- That's what you're
about to find out.

1608
01:10:08.273 --> 01:10:10.620
- [Ronnie] I'm not
quite sure I understand.

1609
01:10:11.828 --> 01:10:15.763
- Ronnie. this is
a beautiful woman

1610
01:10:15.763 --> 01:10:18.006
who just came from
a hard day at work.

1611
01:10:18.006 --> 01:10:19.215
Now she doesn't have time

1612
01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:21.562
to go to Blue Martini
or some Bible study

1613
01:10:21.562 --> 01:10:23.495
to find Prince Charming.

1614
01:10:23.495 --> 01:10:24.944
She has a kid at home and wants

1615
01:10:24.944 --> 01:10:26.946
to fulfill her needs
without any obligation

1616
01:10:26.946 --> 01:10:28.638
or attachment for that matter.

1617
01:10:29.811 --> 01:10:31.951
She has needs just like
any woman or man has.

1618
01:10:33.159 --> 01:10:34.954
That's where you come in.

1619
01:10:34.954 --> 01:10:36.232
Don't worry about anything.

1620
01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:37.198
It's completely safe

1621
01:10:37.198 --> 01:10:39.235
and security's right outside.

1622
01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:40.512
And I don't think I need

1623
01:10:40.512 --> 01:10:41.478
to explain the kind
of debt you owe me

1624
01:10:41.478 --> 01:10:42.790
from saving your life tonight.

1625
01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:46.621
Besides. I'm sure you
could use the rent money.

1626
01:10:46.621 --> 01:10:48.554
Now I expect you to be
a very good employee

1627
01:10:48.554 --> 01:10:49.866
and pay your debt.

1628
01:10:51.902 --> 01:10:52.731
Don't worry. there's
money at the end

1629
01:10:52.731 --> 01:10:54.077
of the session.

1630
01:10:54.077 --> 01:10:56.079
She'll leave it
on the nightstand.

1631
01:10:59.324 --> 01:11:00.463
You work for me now.

1656

- Does that matter.

1657
01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:24.330
It still doesn't change the fact

1658
01:13:24.330 --> 01:13:25.815
that the people who rarely play

1659
01:13:25.815 --> 01:13:27.333
are the ones who actually win.

1660
01:13:30.647 --> 01:13:33.132
- People come around
when something happens

1661
01:13:33.132 --> 01:13:34.927
or they need something.

1662
01:13:34.927 --> 01:13:36.964
Getting paid to do
that almost seems

1663
01:13:36.964 --> 01:13:39.622
too good to be true.

1664
01:13:39.622 --> 01:13:41.244
She used to always tell me.

1665
01:13:41.244 --> 01:13:43.004
hey. you need to slow down

1666
01:13:43.004 --> 01:13:44.212
when I was playing poker

1667
01:13:44.212 --> 01:13:45.835
and I was like slow down
and go find someone.

1668
01:13:47.492 --> 01:13:50.080
I guess she doesn't want
me to end up like her.

1669
01:13:55.638 --> 01:13:57.156
- I think there's something

1670
01:13:57.156 --> 01:13:59.676
that you might wanna know
about your little boyfriend.

1671
01:13:59.676 --> 01:14:00.608
- [Girl] Let's just
say I need to be

1672
01:14:00.608 --> 01:14:03.369
in touch with the camera.

1673
01:14:03.369 --> 01:14:05.302
- [Karey] So you
are trying to play.

1674
01:14:05.302 --> 01:14:06.476
- What the hell are you doing?

1675
01:14:06.476 --> 01:14:08.409
What the hell does that
have to do with me?

1676
01:14:08.409 --> 01:14:09.790
Girl. it's survival out here.

1677
01:14:09.790 --> 01:14:13.552
- You know. you know
you're really not that bad.

1678
01:14:14.519 --> 01:14:16.624
- We still going to the party?

1679
01:14:16.624 --> 01:14:17.832
