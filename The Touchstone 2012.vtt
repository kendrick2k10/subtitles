00:01:31.753 --> 00:01:33.432
- Gimme your water. faggot.

5
00:01:33.498 --> 00:01:34.604
I'm so fucking thirsty.

6
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.148
- Oh my God.
- Oh my God.

00:01:36.214 --> 00:01:39.381
(students chattering)

8
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:41.571
- [Student] How big is it?

9
00:01:41.637 --> 00:01:43.574
(laughing)

10
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.034
- [Student] Oh my God. really big.

11
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.267
(students chattering)

12
00:01:53.691 --> 00:01:54.919
- [Student] You know
what I'm talking about.

13
00:01:54.985 --> 00:01:56.501
- No. I don't.
- Yeah. you do!

14
00:01:56.567 --> 00:01:59.734
(students chattering)

15
00:02:03.618 --> 00:02:04.845
- [Student] It's okay. it's gonna be okay.

16
00:02:04.911 --> 00:02:06.016
- What's up?

17
00:02:06.082 --> 00:02:07.163
- I thought I told you to leave me alone.

18
00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.029
(thudding)

19
00:02:08.062 --> 00:02:10.308
Are you for real. are you?

20
00:02:10.374 --> 00:02:13.977
(students chattering)

21
00:02:14.043 --> 00:02:16.460
(books thud)

22
00:02:17.923 --> 00:02:19.204
- [Student] What's up. queer bait?

23
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.224
- Oh. if it isn't Justin
and his baby Peterson.

24
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.414
- Ouch.
- Blow me. dude.

25
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.974
- Hey. was that Amber
that was just walking by

26
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.077
with her fine ass?

27
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.574
- Yeah. me and her. we got
a little thing going on.

28
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.757
- Oh. please. you couldn't hit that

29
00:02:29.823 --> 00:02:31.474
with roofies and a guided missile.

30
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.714
- Oh. you're one to talk. Romeo.

31
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.543
- Hey. what do you think
about my massage parlor idea?

32
00:02:36.525 --> 00:02:38.711
- I mean. I'm into it.
but we still need a ride.

33
00:02:38.777 --> 00:02:40.684
- Yeah. I was planning
on asking Roger at lunch.

34
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.124
- That kid is the biggest
pussy in our school.

35
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.064
10 bucks says he doesn't do it.

36
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.930
- Bet.

37
00:02:45.963 --> 00:02:47.014
Hey. see you third period?

38
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.280
- All right. sounds good. man.

39
00:02:49.915 --> 00:02:52.154
- You know. raccoons are
really filthy animals.

40
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.334
but they make great hats.

41
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.224
Just look at this one.

42
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.490
Can anyone tell me who
made this hat famous?

43
00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.844
Anyone?

44
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:00.943
Amber McKay?

45
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.164
- Davy Crockett.

46
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.834
- That's right. the greatest explorer

47
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.494
on the American frontier.

48
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.374
Just like each of you. because. tomorrow.

49
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.694
on our field trip to Kickapoo Mountain.

50
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.264
we're gonna be looking for fossils

51
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.954
and arrowheads and bones and relics.

52
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.163
anything you can find.

53
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.154
- How about finding a clue?

54
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.477
He thinks cosplaying is gonna
make this shit interesting?

55
00:03:21.543 --> 00:03:23.184
- Yeah. and. to make matters worse.

56
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.964
tomorrow's gonna be hot as balls.

57
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.514
- [Teacher] Who could
beat something like that?

58
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.480
- Speaking of hot.

59
00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.026
I'd like to explore for
some of her buried treasure.

60
00:03:33.092 --> 00:03:35.994
- [Teacher] I had to get a
whole bunch of rabies shots.

61
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.897
- What do you mean?

62
00:03:36.963 --> 00:03:38.103
- And then I got scurvy.

63
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.324
- A massage parlor?

64
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.224
I bet you'd catch more
crabs than an Alaskan whore.

65
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.622
- That's what condoms are for. dude.

66
00:03:48.688 --> 00:03:50.624
- Didn't you hear they busted
one of those places last week?

67
00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.634
It was on the news. the
cops locked up everyone.

68
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.800
- Yeah. where do you think I got the idea?

69
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.094
- You guys are straight-up crazy.

70
00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.670
- Look. Ryan's dad said this only happens

71
00:03:59.736 --> 00:04:01.374
once every five years.

72
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.174
They raid some unlucky
joint just to make it

73
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.604
look like they care about
stopping prostitution.

74
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.633
Then it's back to business as usual.

75
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:09.780
- It's true. man.

76
00:04:09.813 --> 00:04:11.334
When was the last time you
heard about a raid like that?

77
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.903
- Yeah. so you in?

78
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.858
- Sorry. I don't need it that bad.

79
00:04:16.924 --> 00:04:18.074
- You know who says that?

80
00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.573
Guys who need it the worst.

81
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.033
- 10 bucks. man.

82
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.464
- Better see if Sean can take us.

83
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.114
- Sean. for reals?

84
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.404
Come on. man. I'm not letting that pussy-

85
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.674
- Ah. too late.

86
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.055
Sent.
- Great.

87
00:04:36.121 --> 00:04:37.247
(Justin chuckles)

88
00:04:37.313 --> 00:04:39.044
- Have you guys seen Jordan today?

89
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.204
- [Girls] Oh my God!

90
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.654
- He's so cute.

91
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.094
- So. Cindy. what are you wearing

92
00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.674
to your party Friday?

93
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.284
- [Cindy] I don't know.
I haven't found it yet.

94
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.794
- [Student] What about you. Amber?

95
00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.343
- Well. Matt likes red. so you know.

96
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.634
- So you seriously let him
influence what you wear?

97
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.254
- Hey. sometimes a girl's gotta sacrifice.

98
00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.204
- And how far does the sacrifice go?

99
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.070
Have you guys...

100
00:05:00.103 --> 00:05:00.951
- No!

101
00:05:01.017 --> 00:05:03.564
But we do lots of non-entry stuff.

102
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.764
If I let him get with me too soon.

103
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.304
he may decide there's nothing to keep

104
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.670
him around for the summer.

105
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.734
- Guys are such horndogs.

106
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.804
- Not all guys.

107
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.184
Like Diaz. he's the opposite.

108
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.414
I feel like I'm ready. but
he just keeps making excuses.

109
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.374
Maybe...
- Don't be ridiculous.

110
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.373
You're beautiful.

111
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.614
- Maybe he has steroid dick.

112
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.163
You know. the one muscle
that doesn't benefit.

113
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.344
- Hey. what do you guys think of Ryan?

114
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.404
- Ew. isn't he like best buds

115
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.474
with that perv Justin Peterson?

116
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.340
- [Girls] Ew!

117
00:05:35.373 --> 00:05:37.134
- He's disgusting.
- Gross.

118
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.374
- Yeah. but I don't know.
I heard he likes me.

119
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.324
- I don't get you. Amber.

120
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.004
Matt is fucking hot. and
you're considering Ryan?

121
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.954
- Last time I checked.
a girl can still look.

122
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.173
A girl has got to keep
her options open. right?

123
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.694
- All I know is. I wouldn't
fuck Justin Peterson

124
00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:53.827
with your pussy.

125
00:05:53.893 --> 00:05:56.034
(laughing)
- Cindy!

126
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.764
- Did you see Amber's butt
in those skinny jeans today?

127
00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.234
Aw. man. she bent over and. ooh.

128
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.623
out popped the whale tail.

129
00:06:02.482 --> 00:06:03.564
- What the hell's a whale tail?

130
00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.274
- Dude. it's like when
the thong is poking out

131
00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.223
and it's like a whale tail.

132
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.700
- [Boy] What's up. my niggas?

133
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.414
- Nice one. Sean.

134
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.204
- So I heard there's a couple of pussies

135
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:17.714
out here looking for a ride.

136
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.064
- Yeah. you got mama's whip?

137
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.964
- Yeah. would your mom blow
me for a wooden nickel?

138
00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:23.063
Of course.

139
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.083
- [Justin] Go to the car.

140
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.354
- [Sean] Hold on. I just
gotta move some shit.

141
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:39.420
Got a diaper bag and some
baby shit or something.

142
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.970
- Fuck off. nerd.
- You don't know us like that.

143
00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:45.062
- What?

144
00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.563
Assholes.

145
00:07:02.344 --> 00:07:03.144
(knocking)

146
00:07:03.177 --> 00:07:05.100
- [Ryan] Hey. buddy. can you let us in?

147
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:07.360
- [Justin] Asshole.

148
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.814
- What. I thought you guys were too cool.

149
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.674
- Dude. Pam Blake and Tammy
Powers were right there.

150
00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:14.734
What did you want us to do?

151
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.024
- Yeah. this car is like
kryptonite to all poontang.

152
00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:19.424
- Man. did they see me get in?

153
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:20.374
- Yeah. probably.

154
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.114
- Shit. why didn't you guys say anything?

155
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.424
- Oh. like you had a chance anyway.

156
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:25.323
Just drive.

157
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.384
- All right. so who am
I dropping off first?

158
00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:36.064
- Who said anything about going home?

159
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:36.930
- My mom. for one. I mean...

160
00:07:36.963 --> 00:07:38.144
- See. here we are.

161
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.464
This is what I was telling
you about. the back pages.

162
00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.644
Oh. see. look. they got tantric massage.

163
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:44.474
That's Kama Sutra type stuff. you know?

164
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.374
Me love you long time.

165
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.114
Oh. and here's some shiatsu.

166
00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.411
I'm pretty sure that's
like doggy style. right?

167
00:07:50.477 --> 00:07:52.094
- You retard. you're thinking of Shih Tzu.

168
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.144
- [Sean] What are you guys looking at?

169
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.084
- God. massage. dumb ass!

170
00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:56.224
What. are you trying to get us killed?

171
00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:57.090
- Jesus. seriously. man.

172
00:07:57.123 --> 00:07:58.414
pay attention.
- Fuck.

173
00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.701
- [Ryan] All right. what
about this one up here?

174
00:07:59.767 --> 00:08:02.864
- [Justin] $95. what. are they
giving me a free phone. too?

175
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:04.664
- Wait. massage. are you guys high?

176
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:07.493
I just heard on the news. they
raided one of those places.

177
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:09.820
- All right. this one over here.

178
00:08:09.853 --> 00:08:11.764
There's no price. maybe 95 is cheap.

179
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:13.364
- Nah. nah. I saw this on the Internet.

180
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:15.703
chicks giving it up for like 50 bucks.

181
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:18.440
- Where are we going?

182
00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.214
- Take us here. this one.

183
00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.764
Take us to 8107 Wheeler Avenue.

184
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.434
- That's like way across town.

185
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:27.584
My mom needs the car.

186
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:29.054
- Oh. stop being a wuss.

187
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.313
Mommy will understand.

188
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:32.671
- Well. your dad will. anyways.

189
00:08:32.737 --> 00:08:34.037
- [Justin] (chuckles) Bet.

190
00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.030
- Just drive. faggot.

191
00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:56.904
- What the hell. this
doesn't look like anything.

192
00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.664
- Yeah. well. maybe that's the point.

193
00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:00.544
- It says Suite 300-A.

194
00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:03.384
- Maybe someone should stay guard outside.

195
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:04.250
- Stay guard for what?

196
00:09:04.283 --> 00:09:06.710
We're not bank robbers. I
just wanna get my dick sucked.

197
00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.264
- Wait. wait. shithead.
how's this gonna work?

198
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:16.154
What are we supposed to say?

199
00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.031
- Just ask for the special.

200
00:09:17.097 --> 00:09:18.314
- What's the special?

201
00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:19.284
- Does it matter?

202
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:20.424
It's not like they're accidentally

203
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:22.364
gonna give us an oil
change instead of a blowjob

204
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:23.730
if we ask for the special.

205
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.484
- Shit. man. I don't have any
cash. just my credit cards.

206
00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:28.444
- Just use that.

207
00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.634
- You explain to mom a massage parlor bill

208
00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.001
on her statement.

209
00:09:32.067 --> 00:09:32.867
- He makes a good point.

210
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.354
- All right. well. just
wait for us in the lobby.

211
00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.784
We'll get you next time.

212
00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:39.114
Just don't fucking leave us here. okay?

213
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.013
- Okay.

214
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:50.104
- Can I help you?

215
00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:51.534
- [Justin] We're here for the...

216
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.939
- We're here for the special.

217
00:09:53.005 --> 00:09:53.923
- Yeah.

218
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.733
- You been here before?

219
00:09:56.799 --> 00:09:57.902
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

220
00:09:57.968 --> 00:10:00.634
Yeah. lots of times.

221
00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:01.533
- Yeah.

222
00:10:02.847 --> 00:10:05.314
- $65. each one. you pay now.

223
00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.621
- See. told you. 95 my ass.

224
00:10:08.687 --> 00:10:11.604
(soft Asian music)

225
00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:19.699
- Oh. I'm good. I already got a massage.

226
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:22.719
From my mom.

227
00:10:22.785 --> 00:10:25.702
(soft Asian music)

228
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:44.623
Not any fucking porn?

229
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:51.413
- You pick girl now.

230
00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.364
- Hi. I'm Ryan.

231
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:54.603
- Hi. I'm Walter.

232
00:10:58.559 --> 00:10:59.392
You.

233
00:11:00.906 --> 00:11:02.589
(woman sighs)

234
00:11:02.655 --> 00:11:05.572
(soft Asian music)

235
00:11:09.908 --> 00:11:11.074
- Ryan?
- Oh. no.

236
00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.083
it's actually Brian with a B.

237
00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.981
- [Sean] Do you take credit cards?

238
00:11:17.047 --> 00:11:19.964
(soft Asian music)

239
00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:27.793
- So. just like this?

240
00:11:30.939 --> 00:11:32.673
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

241
00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.780
You wanna look me in the eyes?

242
00:11:40.235 --> 00:11:41.318
I don't know.

243
00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:43.952
What?

244
00:11:46.117 --> 00:11:48.487
I'm pretty sure this was not in the ad.

245
00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:53.576
- Welcome.

246
00:11:53.642 --> 00:11:56.559
(soft Asian music)

247
00:11:58.650 --> 00:11:59.947
- To the special.

248
00:12:00.013 --> 00:12:00.846
- Sure.

249
00:12:04.888 --> 00:12:05.888
- Thank you.

250
00:12:11.646 --> 00:12:15.499
(woman speaking foreign language)

251
00:12:15.565 --> 00:12:18.482
(soft Asian music)

252
00:12:32.788 --> 00:12:34.371
- [Sean] Holy shit!

253
00:12:40.588 --> 00:12:41.687
- Cannot speak English!

254
00:12:41.753 --> 00:12:45.454
She ask you. $100 full service!

255
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.754
1-0-0.

256
00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:48.854
- Oh. okay.

257
00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.200
- You say you been here before!

258
00:12:51.266 --> 00:12:53.723
- I paid 65. so I'm not
going to pay any more.

259
00:12:57.816 --> 00:13:01.983
(woman speaking foreign language)

260
00:13:03.605 --> 00:13:04.808
- Bullshit!

261
00:13:04.874 --> 00:13:07.207
(screaming)

262
00:13:11.229 --> 00:13:13.142
- Raid. dude. it's a fucking raid!

263
00:13:13.208 --> 00:13:17.018
(chattering in foreign language)

264
00:13:17.084 --> 00:13:19.130
- Hey. hey. hey. cops. hold it!

265
00:13:19.196 --> 00:13:21.664
(shouting)

266
00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:23.067
- [Justine] Go. go. go. go. go!

267
00:13:23.133 --> 00:13:25.383
(shouting)

268
00:13:30.826 --> 00:13:32.245
Is he coming?

269
00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:33.767
- I don't think so. man.

270
00:13:33.833 --> 00:13:36.333
(siren wails)

271
00:13:38.317 --> 00:13:40.960
Shit. dude. where the fuck is Sean?

272
00:13:41.026 --> 00:13:42.126
- Are you shitting me?

273
00:13:43.241 --> 00:13:44.783
Aw. dude.

274
00:13:44.849 --> 00:13:46.766
Come on. let's get out.

275
00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:49.804
- How could that happen?

276
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:53.260
- I don't know. dude. I
was horny and distracted.

277
00:13:53.326 --> 00:13:55.934
- You know what the cops are
gonna do if they find that?

278
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.054
- Fuck!

279
00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.896
- All right. relax. relax.

280
00:13:58.962 --> 00:13:59.914
What was in it?

281
00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.644
- My school ID. my library card.

282
00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:02.978
like another 50 bucks.

283
00:14:03.044 --> 00:14:04.127
- Dude. damn.

284
00:14:06.135 --> 00:14:07.611
Sean!

285
00:14:07.677 --> 00:14:09.037
Where the fuck where you. asshole?

286
00:14:10.228 --> 00:14:12.052
You know the place got raided?

287
00:14:12.118 --> 00:14:13.784
- Yeah. yeah. imagine that.

288
00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:16.164
Hey. check this out.

289
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:17.644
- Jesus Christ. dude.

290
00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:18.510
- [Sean] Yep.

291
00:14:18.543 --> 00:14:19.594
- That's got to be like 1000 bucks.

292
00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.824
- Hey. look with your
eyes. not your hands.

293
00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:23.164
- What'd you do?

294
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:24.473
- Well. I took it.

295
00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:27.574
Found it and just took it.

296
00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:28.894
Pretty gangster. huh?

297
00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.484
- Dude. I'm impressed. that's awesome.

298
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:33.047
- [Justin] You better
give us out 65 bucks back.

299
00:14:33.113 --> 00:14:34.063
You fucking better!

300
00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.554
Fuck!

301
00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:38.436
- The bitch stole his wallet. man.

302
00:14:38.502 --> 00:14:40.897
Let's get outta here.

303
00:14:40.963 --> 00:14:43.213
(van revs)

304
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:54.044
Nah. man. I'm sure if they found it.

305
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.202
they would've called your parents by now.

306
00:14:56.268 --> 00:14:57.935
- [Woman] I do not want
to hear anymore about

307
00:14:58.001 --> 00:15:00.455
how I don't pay you enough attention!

308
00:15:00.521 --> 00:15:01.794
- [Man] Well. you don't!

309
00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.924
This cable gets laid more than me!

310
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:07.134
When was the last time
you weren't too tired?

311
00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.374
- Nah. dude. it's my parents.

312
00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.594
I can't hear you.

313
00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:11.474
I'm gonna call you
back. though. all right?

314
00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:12.927
All right. bye.
- Will you keep it down

315
00:15:12.993 --> 00:15:14.179
for Christ's sake?

316
00:15:14.245 --> 00:15:15.845
Your son is in...
- You're the one

317
00:15:15.911 --> 00:15:17.306
who needs to keep it down!

318
00:15:17.372 --> 00:15:19.098
A man needs to sow his oats

319
00:15:19.164 --> 00:15:20.606
more than once every six months!

320
00:15:20.672 --> 00:15:24.005
(pounding thrash metal)

321
00:15:27.629 --> 00:15:28.712
- Get out there!

322
00:15:28.778 --> 00:15:30.070
We're gonna kill Western this year.

323
00:15:30.136 --> 00:15:30.993
- Western is dead!

324
00:15:31.059 --> 00:15:32.316
- It's already to go!

325
00:15:32.382 --> 00:15:33.418
- Yeah!

326
00:15:33.484 --> 00:15:35.897
- Come here. wall fag.

327
00:15:35.963 --> 00:15:37.285
You know what time it is?

328
00:15:37.351 --> 00:15:39.934
Flight 269 cleared for takeoff.

329
00:15:40.879 --> 00:15:43.175
Get the fuck off.
- I'm outta here.

330
00:15:43.241 --> 00:15:44.272
- What?

331
00:15:44.338 --> 00:15:45.792
- Move over. faggots.

332
00:15:45.858 --> 00:15:46.658
- [Sean] Ow!

333
00:15:46.693 --> 00:15:48.294
- [Bully] Time to break this!

334
00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.147
(laughing)

335
00:15:50.213 --> 00:15:51.587
(Sean groans)

336
00:15:51.653 --> 00:15:53.224
Looks really good faggot.

337
00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:54.299
Cry home to your mother.

338
00:15:54.365 --> 00:15:56.483
(Sean groans)

339
00:15:56.549 --> 00:15:58.137
(shouting)
(groaning)

340
00:15:58.203 --> 00:15:59.308
- Come on. bitch.

341
00:15:59.374 --> 00:16:00.836
It's time for your big entrance.

342
00:16:00.902 --> 00:16:01.853
- Come on. you pompous fag.

343
00:16:01.919 --> 00:16:03.741
Let everyone see your tighty whities.

344
00:16:03.807 --> 00:16:05.938
- No. I don't wanna do this!

345
00:16:06.004 --> 00:16:07.205
- Guess where we're going?

346
00:16:07.271 --> 00:16:08.355
- Why do you?

347
00:16:08.421 --> 00:16:09.897
Oh. no!

348
00:16:09.963 --> 00:16:12.535
- [Bully] Outside. faggot.

349
00:16:12.601 --> 00:16:13.401
Outside. bitch.

350
00:16:13.434 --> 00:16:18.370
(laughing)
(chattering)

351
00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:20.158
- [Student] Poor Sean. are you okay?

352
00:16:20.224 --> 00:16:24.891
(laughing)
(chattering)

353
00:16:26.743 --> 00:16:27.993
- I got your shorts. man.

354
00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:31.074
- Thanks.

355
00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.940
Excuse me while I go commit suicide.

356
00:16:33.949 --> 00:16:35.844
- [Student] Take pictures!

357
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:36.710
- [Ryan] Is your ass okay?

358
00:16:36.743 --> 00:16:38.511
- [Student] Oh my God.

359
00:16:38.577 --> 00:16:39.994
- [Student] What?

360
00:16:49.423 --> 00:16:51.514
- Hey. Ryan. how was school?

361
00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.034
- It sucked.

362
00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.534
- Ryan!

363
00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.224
- What. Mom. you want me to lie?

364
00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:58.064
We had to play football in PE today.

365
00:16:58.130 --> 00:16:58.930
It was embarrassing.

366
00:16:58.970 --> 00:16:59.866
- Oh yeah?

367
00:16:59.932 --> 00:17:01.474
Meet any hot babes?

368
00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:02.740
- Just the cheerleaders.

369
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:04.743
- Cheerleaders.

370
00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:07.994
Let me tell you about that.

371
00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:09.514
You think you want girls.

372
00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:12.234
and. before you know it. you're 45.

373
00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.154
you're balding. maybe you
put on a pound or two.

374
00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.574
and your dearly beloved wife of 20 years

375
00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.844
won't give you the time of day.

376
00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:22.077
- And your point is. Bill?

377
00:17:22.921 --> 00:17:25.181
- Well. I remember when
you were a cheerleader.

378
00:17:25.247 --> 00:17:27.034
- Oh. back when you were in shape?

379
00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.123
Now look at you.

380
00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.064
- I'm just saying. a lot of young ladies

381
00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:32.514
would be very interested in me.

382
00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:33.904
- Dad. Mom!

383
00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:34.993
Are you kidding me?

384
00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.374
- Do your homework. young man!

385
00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.623
And clean that filthy rodent cage!

386
00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:49.603
Ryan!

387
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:53.624
Ryan. can you come down for a minute?

388
00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:54.553
Ryan!

389
00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:57.324
- Yeah?

390
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:59.804
- Your permission slip.
the field trip tomorrow.

391
00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:01.470
- That's right. I almost forgot.

392
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.874
Dad. I saw on the news last night

393
00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:06.264
that the massage parlor got raided again.

394
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:07.184
I thought you said that only happens

395
00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:09.224
like once every five years.

396
00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:12.144
- Yeah. well. I've been wrong before.

397
00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:13.954
It's terrible news. though.

398
00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:17.254
Now where am I gonna go
to get my weekly coochie?

399
00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.014
- That's not funny!

400
00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.711
- It's a joke. El. at
least an attempt at one.

401
00:18:21.777 --> 00:18:23.334
- You can go wherever you want.

402
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.381
No one would have you.

403
00:18:24.447 --> 00:18:26.653
and I won't be here when you get back.

404
00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:33.494
- Dad.

405
00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:34.510
- [Dad] Yeah. Ryan?

406
00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:37.963
- Never mind.

407
00:18:44.629 --> 00:18:47.129
(bus rumbles)

408
00:18:48.957 --> 00:18:51.574
- All right. we're going on
a trip to Kickapoo Mountain.

409
00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.583
Gonna see lots of cliffs
and water and waterfalls.

410
00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.079
Hey. you boys aren't
playing for money. are you?

411
00:18:58.145 --> 00:18:59.193
- [Boy] No.

412
00:18:59.259 --> 00:19:02.618
- No. not at all.
- Okay. all right.

413
00:19:02.684 --> 00:19:04.074
All right. we're gonna see the mountain.

414
00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:05.366
we're gonna see the
river and some waterfalls

415
00:19:05.432 --> 00:19:07.951
and lots of (speaker drowned out by bus).

416
00:19:08.017 --> 00:19:09.292
We're going to see waterfalls

417
00:19:09.358 --> 00:19:12.665
and bugs and bears (speaker
cut off by squeaking).

418
00:19:12.731 --> 00:19:14.981
(laughing)

419
00:19:15.861 --> 00:19:17.404
And then we're gonna
see where Daniel Boone

420
00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:18.755
paddled his canoe down the river

421
00:19:18.821 --> 00:19:21.510
and Pike wrestled a bear.

422
00:19:21.576 --> 00:19:23.826
(laughing)

423
00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:28.464
All right. we're here.

424
00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:30.913
Everybody out. leave
your lunches on the bus.

425
00:19:40.099 --> 00:19:40.899
- Dude. Amber's all alone.

426
00:19:40.932 --> 00:19:42.364
You should go talk to her.

427
00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:43.321
- What am I gonna say?

428
00:19:43.387 --> 00:19:46.624
Hey. Amber. I'm the retard who
you want nothing to do with.

429
00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:48.338
but will you have sex with me?

430
00:19:48.404 --> 00:19:49.204
Is that good?

431
00:19:49.262 --> 00:19:50.744
- That's not bad.

432
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:53.114
Or you could go give her
a compliment or something.

433
00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:54.680
God. just watch me. all right?

434
00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:10.433
- Excuse you.

435
00:20:21.362 --> 00:20:23.594
- That was good. that was really smooth.

436
00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:24.760
I thought you had her.

437
00:20:25.775 --> 00:20:28.275
(water roars)

438
00:20:44.915 --> 00:20:48.082
(students chattering)

439
00:20:55.555 --> 00:20:58.009
- [Teacher] Wow. getting a
little bit violent over there.

440
00:20:58.075 --> 00:20:58.908
- I know!

441
00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:01.404
- [Ryan] You find anything?

442
00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:03.434
- Yeah. I found out how much my balls

443
00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.404
can sweat in 30 minutes.

444
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:06.705
- This sucks!
- This sucks!

445
00:21:06.771 --> 00:21:10.297
It sucks.
- Man. this shit sucks.

446
00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.080
- [Justin] What is that?

447
00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:20.704
Should we go talk to Rosenbaum?

448
00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:21.570
- [Ryan] Yeah. where is he?

449
00:21:21.603 --> 00:21:22.723
- How the fuck would I know?

450
00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:32.047
- Hey. Mr. Rosenbaum. you
ever see one of these before?

451
00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.764
- [Mr. Rosenbaum] Looks like
a small fetish of some kind.

452
00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:44.494
- A fetish. like into feet
or bukkake or something?

453
00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.334
- Don't be stupid. Justin.

454
00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.234
It's a name given to
small carvings like this

455
00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:49.744
by Native American peoples.

456
00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:52.224
They believe it harnesses
the power of nature.

457
00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:53.741
Nice find. Wilson.

458
00:21:53.807 --> 00:21:58.807
- Thanks.

459
00:21:59.604 --> 00:22:02.187
(water hisses)

460
00:22:14.053 --> 00:22:15.636
- [Justin] Ah. God.

461
00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:19.974
- [Cindy] Hey. Brian. what's going on?

462
00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.054
- It's Ryan. actually.

463
00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:25.294
- Hi. Ryan. you have
something on your face there.

464
00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:26.663
- Um. what?

465
00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:30.496
Yeah. totally.

466
00:22:30.562 --> 00:22:31.762
- [Girl] Oh. poor thing.

467
00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.944
Dust him and he gets so cute.

468
00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:36.367
- [Amber] Why don't you come sit with me?

469
00:22:36.433 --> 00:22:37.944
- With me.

470
00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:39.396
- I mean. ladies. we can just all go up

471
00:22:39.462 --> 00:22:41.462
and sit together. right?

472
00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:48.913
Yeah. that's fine. okay.

473
00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.643
- Oh my God. Ryan. you are so funny!

474
00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:56.333
- I try really hard.

475
00:22:58.580 --> 00:22:59.634
- Oh. you have sweat dripping

476
00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:00.904
from your forehead right there.

477
00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:02.320
- [Cindy] All that digging.

478
00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:07.370
- [Amber] You mind if
I. you know. wash you

479
00:23:07.436 --> 00:23:09.241
off a little later. hmm?

480
00:23:09.307 --> 00:23:10.696
- [Ryan] I don't mind at all. no.

481
00:23:10.762 --> 00:23:12.012
- [Amber] Okay.

482
00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.274
- Yeah. I'm telling
you. man. it was crazy.

483
00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.344
It was like a feeding frenzy.

484
00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:24.824
Sydney Tollover even grabbed it.

485
00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:26.134
- Grabbed what?

486
00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.554
- It. you retard.

487
00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:29.920
- She grabbed your Justin
Peterson on the bus?

488
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:33.302
- Dude. all I know is that
they wanted it. all right?

489
00:23:33.368 --> 00:23:35.363
Goddamn. Amber smelled so good!

490
00:23:36.966 --> 00:23:37.799
Ah. shit.

491
00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:39.793
- Hey. what up. Ryan?

492
00:23:41.173 --> 00:23:42.814
- What's up. Matt?

493
00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.874
- So. what do you think you're
doing with Amber today. huh?

494
00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:48.224
You know. my Amber?

495
00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:50.124
- Yeah. faggot.
- Wait. your Amber?

496
00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:51.524
Like. you got a receipt for that shit?

497
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:52.943
- Back the fuck up.

498
00:23:53.863 --> 00:23:55.474
- Dude. what the hell. all right?

499
00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:57.274
She came on to me. I didn't do anything.

500
00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:58.694
- All right. well. maybe next time.

501
00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.704
you should play a little harder to get.

502
00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:02.844
- Yeah. well. maybe Amber

503
00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:04.604
finally got herself a little class.

504
00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:06.725
- Yeah. class.
- Got herself some class. huh?

505
00:24:06.791 --> 00:24:08.064
(grunting)

506
00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:09.954
- Stay down like how your dad likes it.

507
00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:11.344
- Fuck face!

508
00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:12.510
- [Diaz] Dumb asshole.

509
00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.944
- [Justin] Dude. you all right?

510
00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:17.444
- Yeah. yeah.
- I had your back.

511
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:18.414
I mean. from like over there.

512
00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.647
but. like. you got his back?
- Yeah.

513
00:24:20.713 --> 00:24:23.735
- [Ryan] Fuck those guys. man.

514
00:24:23.801 --> 00:24:26.774
- [Justin] The car is that way.

515
00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.834
- So how was the field trip today?

516
00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.304
- It was all right. I guess.

517
00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:31.644
Beats being at school.

518
00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:33.644
- Find anything interesting?

519
00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:34.560
- Actually. yeah.

520
00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:41.490
(mysterious instrumental music)

521
00:24:44.031 --> 00:24:46.084
- Say. that's pretty neat!

522
00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:48.374
Looks like a little rabbit or something.

523
00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.134
- [Ryan] You like it. it's yours.

524
00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.154
- You don't want it?

525
00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:53.024
- Hell no. it's just an old rock.

526
00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:54.314
- Suit yourself.

527
00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:55.213
Thanks!

528
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.914
You know. there was a time when you

529
00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:06.564
used to kiss me goodbye.

530
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:08.980
- That ship sailed a long time ago.

531
00:25:09.046 --> 00:25:10.224
- You see that. Ryan?

532
00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:12.090
That's a former cheerleader talking.

533
00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:18.440
- Maybe there's nothing worth
kissing any more anyway.

534
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.623
Oh. you're still here.

535
00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:23.293
Ryan. I.

536
00:25:29.663 --> 00:25:33.034
- Sir. excuse me. sir.
you forgot your receipt.

537
00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:34.864
- Oh. thanks very much.

538
00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:35.763
- And my number.

539
00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:37.663
Call me.

540
00:25:39.824 --> 00:25:40.657
Okay?

541
00:25:49.238 --> 00:25:51.738
(phone rings)

542
00:25:56.837 --> 00:25:57.637
- Hello?

543
00:25:57.670 --> 00:25:58.905
Who is this?

544
00:25:58.971 --> 00:26:00.784
Oh. well. you'll have to hold on.

545
00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:02.273
Just hold on a minute.

546
00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.534
Bill. it's for you.

547
00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.073
Tom Riley from golf.

548
00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:10.173
- Hello.

549
00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:12.563
Tom. yes.

550
00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:17.123
There must be some misunderstanding.

551
00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:23.254
Yeah. but that's not the way it happened.

552
00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:26.726
I swear to you. your
Lindsey was hitting on me.

553
00:26:26.792 --> 00:26:29.634
Of course I know she's 17!

554
00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:31.957
I don't think of your daughter that way.

555
00:26:32.023 --> 00:26:33.863
I never said two words to her.

556
00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:40.504
I'm telling you for the
last time. talk to her!

557
00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:42.123
She came on to me.

558
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:45.094
I didn't do anything!

559
00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:46.483
- He didn't do anything.

560
00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:49.634
- That's right.

561
00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.073
Now. goodnight.

562
00:26:58.100 --> 00:26:59.484
- I'm telling you. it's the rock.

563
00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:01.514
I mean. seriously. that's
gotta be the reason

564
00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:02.814
why those girls got all sexed up with me

565
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.144
on the bus yesterday.

566
00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:05.030
- Bullshit.

567
00:27:05.096 --> 00:27:06.364
You're so fucking dumb.
- You're an idiot. man.

568
00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:07.804
- No. I'm not kidding. I'm not kidding.

569
00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:09.774
My dad's golf partner won't even talk

570
00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:11.414
to him anymore because. all of a sudden.

571
00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.544
his daughter wants to fuck my dad

572
00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:14.844
right after I gave him the rock.

573
00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:16.574
- Gotta admit. that's pretty wack.

574
00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.568
- You think it has some
sort of Spanish fly powers

575
00:27:18.634 --> 00:27:20.374
or something?

576
00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.744
- I mean. yeah. something like that.

577
00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:23.754
You know. it's definitely
more than just a rock.

578
00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.314
- I mean. there's only
one way to make sure

579
00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:26.474
it works like you say it does.

580
00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:28.144
- Yeah. no. we gotta test it.

581
00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:29.754
- Yeah. like now.

582
00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:30.774
So give it!

583
00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:31.974
- My dad still has it.

584
00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.224
- Well. you gotta get it back!

585
00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:35.274
- Yeah. I know. but I don't
wanna get him suspicious.

586
00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:36.894
I gotta wait for the right
opportunity to swipe it.

587
00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.304
- Hey. man. we'll go to the library

588
00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:39.174
and try to figure out what it is.

589
00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.594
- Yeah. that's a good idea.

590
00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:42.844
I'm gonna go home. I'm gonna grab it.

591
00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:43.954
and then we'll meet up later.

592
00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:47.224
- Wait. we'll go to the library?

593
00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:48.454
- Come on. man. it'll be nice.

594
00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:49.901
Just me and you browsing.
- I'm so fucking lucky

595
00:27:49.967 --> 00:27:51.550
you're my ride home.

596
00:27:56.670 --> 00:27:58.954
Dude. you have no idea
how many cool points

597
00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:01.264
I'm losing being seen at a library.

598
00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:03.824
- Dude. you are so stupid.

599
00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:05.954
A condition. which studies show.

600
00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.394
is linked to low library patronage.

601
00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.847
- Yeah. so is nerdism.

602
00:28:10.913 --> 00:28:11.914
- That's not even a word. man.

603
00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:13.497
- Shut up. Sean!
- You can't just add

604
00:28:13.563 --> 00:28:16.513
"ism" to a word.
- Let's just find a computer.

605
00:28:16.579 --> 00:28:18.100
- [Sean] All right. all
right. all right. all right.

606
00:28:18.166 --> 00:28:21.354
So just look up Native American.

607
00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:23.733
Okay. just Native American.
- I got it.

608
00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:28.524
- Stones. rocks.
- How about this one?

609
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:31.974
- Hi. welcome to my wild world of fantasy.

610
00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.068
- Wild world of fantasy. Sean.

611
00:28:34.134 --> 00:28:35.934
- What is this?
- I absolutely love to play.

612
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.604
- She loves to play.
- I enjoy all sorts

613
00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:39.190
of kinky fetish fun.

614
00:28:39.256 --> 00:28:41.568
- Kinky fetish fun. Sean.

615
00:28:41.634 --> 00:28:44.237
- It's too loud.
- You sick. sick bastard!

616
00:28:44.303 --> 00:28:45.989
- [Sean] Just turn it down.

617
00:28:46.055 --> 00:28:47.884
I don't want people looking at it.

618
00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:49.024
- There's no one here.
- Sometimes. I like to spank

619
00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:51.484
bad little boys.
- Keep that guy.

620
00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:52.864
those guys waiting?

621
00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:54.294
- After all. you need to be punished

622
00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.004
when you've been naughty.

623
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:57.055
- [Justin] Punished.

624
00:28:57.121 --> 00:28:59.124
- I'm talking to you. Uncle Frank!

625
00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.990
- [Sean] All right. navigate away.

626
00:29:00.023 --> 00:29:02.714
People might be monitoring
user activity or something.

627
00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:04.060
- [Justin] Really?

628
00:29:04.126 --> 00:29:04.966
- Yeah.
- They don't monitor

629
00:29:05.032 --> 00:29:07.423
that shit. who has the time?

630
00:29:07.489 --> 00:29:08.289
- [Sean] I don't know.

631
00:29:08.322 --> 00:29:09.438
just navigate away.
- Hi. guys.

632
00:29:09.504 --> 00:29:10.478
- [Fetish Girl] I know
exactly what you need.

633
00:29:10.544 --> 00:29:12.534
- Hey. Cindy.
- I'll restrain you

634
00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.374
and make you crawl on your hands and knees

635
00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:16.774
and clean my toilet with your tongue.

636
00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:19.593
And. after that...
- Disgusting!

637
00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.774
- [Fetish Girl] I'll
drain you of your nasty

638
00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:22.784
man juice.
- Station Two.

639
00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:23.617
- [Fetish Girl] And feed it to you

640
00:29:23.683 --> 00:29:25.023
like the pig that you are!

641
00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:27.784
- Can I use your computer
to print something.

642
00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:30.104
- Well. you'll have to ask Sean.

643
00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:31.378
He's the one using it.

644
00:29:31.444 --> 00:29:32.764
- [Sean] Nah.

645
00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:35.554
- Station Two. I'm going to
have to ask you to leave.

646
00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:37.039
- Yeah. get a life. perv.

647
00:29:37.105 --> 00:29:37.905
Am I right?
- Would you like me

648
00:29:37.938 --> 00:29:38.738
to paddle your little bottom for you?

649
00:29:38.771 --> 00:29:42.064
- We cannot have public access computers

650
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:44.934
used to view pornographic content!

651
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:45.934
- [Fetish Girl] Well.
you can forget about it.

652
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.604
you sick bastard!

653
00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:48.720
- Fucking never mind.

654
00:29:50.086 --> 00:29:52.804
- And this is also a no swear zone.

655
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:55.413
Now beat it. Mister.

656
00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:59.124
- [Fetish Girl] And I'll
put these toes in your face

657
00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:01.248
and give you all this
athlete's foot. actually.

658
00:30:01.314 --> 00:30:03.481
- Ew. what the hell?
- God!

659
00:30:04.686 --> 00:30:07.186
- [Fetish Girl] You like that?

660
00:30:16.063 --> 00:30:18.034
- Video game broken?

661
00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:20.194
- What. a guy can't just
hang out with his dad

662
00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:21.364
and watch the news?

663
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:22.484
- You kidding me?

664
00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:23.453
This is great!

665
00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.264
Tell you what. you want a beer?

666
00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:28.664
- Fuck. yeah. sure.

667
00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:30.363
- Get one for me. too. would you?

668
00:30:43.043 --> 00:30:45.526
Well. I'm gonna take a shower.

669
00:30:45.592 --> 00:30:46.793
No more beer for you.

670
00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:48.523
- All right.

671
00:30:52.604 --> 00:30:55.271
(shower hisses)

672
00:31:15.371 --> 00:31:17.291
- Ooh. Lindsey.

673
00:31:17.357 --> 00:31:20.524
Oh. holy fuck!
- I didn't see anything!

674
00:31:31.009 --> 00:31:32.315
So. you guys ready for this?

675
00:31:32.381 --> 00:31:33.696
- Yeah.
- Oh. yeah.

676
00:31:33.762 --> 00:31:37.345
(funky instrumental music)

677
00:32:55.136 --> 00:32:57.886
Dude. can you fucking believe it?

678
00:33:00.503 --> 00:33:02.120
- [Amber] Ooh. hi. Brian.

679
00:33:02.186 --> 00:33:02.986
- Amber.

680
00:33:03.019 --> 00:33:04.844
- I was wondering what you
were doing after school?

681
00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:06.557
Maybe you and I could. um?

682
00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:17.674
Oh. so. like I was saying.

683
00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:20.273
maybe you and I could go out after school.

684
00:33:21.727 --> 00:33:22.527
- And me.

685
00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:23.854
I'm having a party this Friday.

686
00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:24.911
if you wanna come.

687
00:33:24.977 --> 00:33:25.982
- Excuse me. ladies.

688
00:33:26.048 --> 00:33:28.544
You. I need a word with you.

689
00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:29.443
Grab him. boys.

690
00:33:30.505 --> 00:33:31.338
- Hey.

691
00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:36.394
Stop!

692
00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:37.686
What are you doing?

693
00:33:37.752 --> 00:33:38.835
Let go of me!

694
00:33:40.769 --> 00:33:43.257
Hands. get your hands out of my pants!

695
00:33:43.323 --> 00:33:46.240
(funky rock music)

696
00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:02.564
- And so. class. tonight's assignment

697
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:06.404
is to read any short story by any author

698
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:07.963
of the Romantic period.

699
00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.994
Katie. darling. where do
you think you're going?

700
00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:12.804
- I was just gonna change my seat

701
00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:14.183
somewhere in the back.

702
00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:18.683
- No. you'll sit in your assigned seat.

703
00:34:20.222 --> 00:34:21.489
- Hey. stop!
- Move!

704
00:34:21.555 --> 00:34:23.039
- Girls!
- Stop!

705
00:34:23.105 --> 00:34:24.406
- He's mine!
- Hey. stop!

706
00:34:24.472 --> 00:34:26.111
- Stop!
- What are you doing?

707
00:34:26.177 --> 00:34:29.037
- Katie. go. go to the
principal's office right now!

708
00:34:29.103 --> 00:34:31.475
- Get outta here!
- Stop!

709
00:34:31.541 --> 00:34:33.128
- What's going on?
- Katie. no!

710
00:34:33.194 --> 00:34:34.584
- Girls. stop it!
- Get off of him!

711
00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:36.074
- Stop it. Gina.

712
00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:37.122
Go to the principal's office

713
00:34:37.188 --> 00:34:37.988
right now.
- Yeah. go to

714
00:34:38.021 --> 00:34:39.470
the principal's office.
- He's mine!

715
00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.318
- You. too.

716
00:34:42.384 --> 00:34:43.801
Come on. get out.

717
00:34:49.323 --> 00:34:51.024
- I didn't do anything.

718
00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:52.812
- What's that you've got. Mr. Wilson?

719
00:34:52.878 --> 00:34:54.287
- Oh. it's nothing.

720
00:34:54.353 --> 00:34:56.083
It's my good luck charm.

721
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.104
- Well. whatever it is. it has nothing

722
00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:01.064
to do with English literature.

723
00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:03.734
- It's got something to do
with the Romantic period.

724
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.050
- Now. you may have it back after class

725
00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:09.847
or later in detention. if you'd rather.

726
00:35:15.737 --> 00:35:19.737
(percussive instrumental music)

727
00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:15.606
♪ Yeah. yeah. yeah ♪

728
00:36:15.672 --> 00:36:17.229
♪ Yeah. yeah. yeah ♪

729
00:36:17.295 --> 00:36:18.095
(record scratches)

730
00:36:18.128 --> 00:36:19.502
What's going on here?

731
00:36:19.568 --> 00:36:20.857
(bell rings)

732
00:36:20.923 --> 00:36:24.923
(percussive instrumental music)

733
00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:43.754
- Miss Sumner. I've been bad.

734
00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:44.870
Can I have detention?

735
00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:47.581
- Boys. go on.

736
00:36:47.647 --> 00:36:49.108
You're gonna be late for your next period.

737
00:36:49.174 --> 00:36:50.883
Go on. go. go. go.

738
00:36:55.419 --> 00:36:58.103
- Miss Sumner. you are
so fucking beautiful.

739
00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:00.477
- Thank you. Art.

740
00:37:00.543 --> 00:37:02.134
Thank you. go on.

741
00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:05.437
Shoo. shoo. shoo. shoo.
go. go. go. go. go.

742
00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:08.570
Go. boys. go.

743
00:37:08.636 --> 00:37:12.636
(percussive instrumental music)

744
00:37:21.970 --> 00:37:25.464
Next time. leave your toys at home.

745
00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:26.330
- Yes. ma'am.

746
00:37:26.363 --> 00:37:29.242
(record scratches)

747
00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:33.064
- Dude!

748
00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:33.954
Try it.

749
00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:35.494
- No way. man.

750
00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:37.160
- Well. here. give it. I'll try.

751
00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:43.367
- Yes. Mr. Peterson?

752
00:37:43.433 --> 00:37:47.863
- Miss Sumner. I was
wondering. do you like me?

753
00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:53.164
- Well. certainly. Justin.

754
00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:54.702
I like all my students.

755
00:37:54.768 --> 00:37:56.768
- Good. 'cause I just wanted to know if.

756
00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:02.474
- Wait til I talk to your mother

757
00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:04.190
about that filthy mouth of yours!

758
00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:07.527
- [Justin] Didn't work at all.

759
00:38:09.497 --> 00:38:11.084
- So. you're sure you
haven't seen him. man?

760
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:12.514
- Yeah. dude. not since
fifth period English.

761
00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:13.972
- Guys.
- Oh my God!

762
00:38:14.038 --> 00:38:15.304
- Dude. where have you been. man?

763
00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:16.724
- I'm trying to get away
from these girls. man.

764
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:18.643
If I'm not careful.
they'll be all over me.

765
00:38:18.709 --> 00:38:20.459
You know. it kinda sucks being hot.

766
00:38:21.418 --> 00:38:22.218
- Yeah. don't forget it's just because

767
00:38:22.251 --> 00:38:23.574
of what's in your pocket.

768
00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.104
You are still a loser.

769
00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:25.970
- Yeah. man.

770
00:38:26.003 --> 00:38:27.234
- And it doesn't even work right.

771
00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:28.100
- Are you kidding me?

772
00:38:28.133 --> 00:38:29.374
Did you not see Sumner today?

773
00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.894
She was off the chain hot.

774
00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.114
- Sumner. from the English department?

775
00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:34.501
Are you high. man?

776
00:38:34.567 --> 00:38:35.367
- [Ryan] You didn't tell him?

777
00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:36.924
- Nope.
- Dude. Sumner got a hold

778
00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:38.054
of the rock today and she turned

779
00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:40.444
into like the phattest
hottie I've ever seen.

780
00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:42.714
- Shit. man. if only I
was dumb like you guys

781
00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:45.114
and wasn't in AP. we could
have the same classes.

782
00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:48.414
- Gee. no offense. asshole.

783
00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:49.834
And. anyway. how come when I had the rock

784
00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:51.174
and I talked to Sumner. she went all

785
00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:52.854
Jerry Springer on me?

786
00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.254
- I can't figure that one out.

787
00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:56.184
- You hit on Sumner?

788
00:38:56.250 --> 00:38:57.264
- Maybe she's like a tranny or something.

789
00:38:57.330 --> 00:38:59.164
I've seen some pictures
where you can hardly tell

790
00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:00.994
if they have...
- Dude. shut the fuck up.

791
00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:03.524
No way. dude. all right. listen.

792
00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:04.744
it's very obvious that we need to do

793
00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:06.294
some more tests on this.

794
00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.514
All right. can you guys skip next period?

795
00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:09.634
- Dude. for this. I would skip college.

796
00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:11.684
- All right. all right.
Sean. go get your car.

797
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:12.914
- Wait. why?

798
00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:14.144
- Don't ask fucking questions.

799
00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:15.433
just go get your car.

800
00:39:16.768 --> 00:39:18.744
- Okay.
- Shit. girls. girls. come on!

801
00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:20.860
- I'll get my car. meet me at the corner.

802
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:26.524
All right. where are we going?

803
00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:27.390
- To your house.

804
00:39:27.423 --> 00:39:29.174
- What. that's the last place I wanna go

805
00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:30.344
when we're skipping school.

806
00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:31.210
- Yeah. I know. I just wanna try

807
00:39:31.243 --> 00:39:32.530
this thing out on your mom.

808
00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:34.954
- What. no way you and that rock

809
00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:36.564
are going anywhere near my mom!

810
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:39.377
- Jesus. take it easy. psycho. all right?

811
00:39:39.443 --> 00:39:41.744
I just wanna see if someone like your mom.

812
00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:44.504
like a Sumner. doesn't
get the hots for me.

813
00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:45.624
That might tell us something.

814
00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:47.924
- Yeah. it'll mean she's
not into stupid fags.

815
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:51.464
- Oh. come on. Sean. it's not
about him banging your mom.

816
00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:52.734
Is it?

817
00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:53.744
- Of course not. dude.

818
00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:56.283
Sean's mom is a cow. not a cougar.

819
00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:59.584
- Take it back. say you're
sorry and take it back

820
00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:01.370
or get out of my car and
we're not friends anymore.

821
00:40:01.436 --> 00:40:03.984
- Jesus. dude. don't be so sensitive.

822
00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:05.754
- Say you're sorry.

823
00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:07.144
- All right. all right. I'm sorry.

824
00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:09.054
We can go somewhere else.

825
00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:09.953
I'm sorry.

826
00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:14.050
I'm sorry your mom is a cow.

827
00:40:14.116 --> 00:40:15.728
(Justin moos)

828
00:40:15.794 --> 00:40:18.044
(laughing)

829
00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:21.464
- So. what are we doing at the mall?

830
00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:23.464
Only the skeezers hang out here.

831
00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:25.024
- He's got a plan obviously.

832
00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:26.024
- Yeah. what?

833
00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:28.453
- Just a plan. shut the fuck up.

834
00:40:31.591 --> 00:40:33.814
All right. so what's this
plan of yours. genius?

835
00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:35.384
- It'll all make sense in a minute.

836
00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:36.354
Just keep your eyes peeled.

837
00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:37.410
- For what?
- For what?

838
00:40:37.476 --> 00:40:38.444
- You'll see.

839
00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:39.923
- I see a mall.

840
00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:42.313
- There she is.

841
00:40:43.528 --> 00:40:45.454
- What. all I see is Sally Beasley.

842
00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.454
- Easy Beasley. I get it now.

843
00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.374
- Yep. yep.

844
00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.644
I'm thinking the rock
only works on virgins.

845
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:52.954
- Oh. yeah. you idiots. Sally Beasley's

846
00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:55.104
slept with like half our class already.

847
00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:57.640
- I think the point is
to prove it won't work.

848
00:40:58.593 --> 00:40:59.426
- Yeah.

849
00:41:03.709 --> 00:41:04.959
- There she is.

850
00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:14.223
Hey. Easy. uh. Sally.

851
00:41:15.762 --> 00:41:17.542
How you doing?
- I know you?

852
00:41:17.608 --> 00:41:19.904
- We go to school together. Ryan Wilson.

853
00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:22.284
- Right. right.

854
00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:25.723
- I was just wondering if
you're feeling what I'm feeling.

855
00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:28.963
- Like that stomach
flu thing going around?

856
00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:31.747
- No. not the stomach flu thing.

857
00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:36.593
- You must be Billy Godfried's brother.

858
00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:38.524
- No.

859
00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:39.984
- Yeah. you are.

860
00:41:40.050 --> 00:41:42.983
I'd recognize that bone
structure anywhere.

861
00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:45.976
Only. you're even cuter.

862
00:41:46.042 --> 00:41:47.824
(Sean chuckles)

863
00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:51.203
- I think we've learned
all we need to know. guys.

864
00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:54.423
- Let's go.
- Thanks a lot. Sally.

865
00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.744
- Come on.
- Whatever. you guys

866
00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:57.643
are weird.

867
00:41:58.540 --> 00:41:59.904
- Dude. can you believe this?

868
00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:01.204
I mean. holy shit!

869
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:03.204
- I know. man. Sally likes me.

870
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:05.623
- No. ass clown. fucking virgins!

871
00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:09.354
- Hey. Ryan. didn't you say before

872
00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:11.194
when Sumner got the stone

873
00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:13.173
that you said she looked hot.

874
00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:16.204
- Yeah. well. why are
you bringing that up?

875
00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:17.634
- Well. I mean. you said before

876
00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:19.014
that while you were on vacation

877
00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:20.983
you bagged no fewer than two hotties.

878
00:42:22.035 --> 00:42:25.014
- You guys know I've always
had a thing for Sumner.

879
00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:26.892
I mean. I always thought
she was really sexy.

880
00:42:26.958 --> 00:42:28.124
like kind of like a TILF.

881
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:30.940
- Try a GILF. maybe. virgin.

882
00:42:31.006 --> 00:42:32.191
- Whatever. dickwad.

883
00:42:32.257 --> 00:42:34.590
(chuckling)

884
00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:40.004
The point is it was no different for me

885
00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:41.454
yesterday with Sumner.

886
00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:43.694
Why. did you think she was
hot just because of the stone.

887
00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:44.747
you fucking virgin?

888
00:42:44.813 --> 00:42:47.054
- Hey. first off. this
is about you. Wilson.

889
00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:49.224
and. second off. you all know I had

890
00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:51.224
Nancy Mullin upstairs at that party

891
00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:52.743
last year on Halloween.

892
00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:57.763
Oh my God.

893
00:43:00.663 --> 00:43:02.413
- I'm gonna fuck you.

894
00:43:03.786 --> 00:43:04.924
Fuck!

895
00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:06.084
Justin Peterson!

896
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:08.025
I thought you were Mike!

897
00:43:08.091 --> 00:43:09.060
- No shit?

898
00:43:09.126 --> 00:43:10.977
He's a skeleton. too.

899
00:43:11.043 --> 00:43:12.626
- So fucking gross!

900
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:14.773
- I can be Mike!

901
00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:18.274
Mike's a dick!

902
00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:20.634
- Yeah. conveniently on
the night she left town.

903
00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:22.354
so we could never confirm the hit.

904
00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:26.874
- Awm. whatever. you know
she was digging on my boner.

905
00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:28.284
- Yeah. whatever.

906
00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:29.707
Jesus.
- Well. wait. anyway.

907
00:43:29.773 --> 00:43:31.593
what are you talking about. virgin?

908
00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:35.414
- Oh yeah. don't bother with him.

909
00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.780
He's not gonna understand.

910
00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:44.453
- Hey. son.

911
00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:47.864
- Hey.

912
00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:49.634
- How was school today?

913
00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:51.560
And don't say it sucked.

914
00:43:51.626 --> 00:43:52.793
- It was okay.

915
00:43:53.887 --> 00:43:55.083
Are you guys okay?

916
00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.963
- Everything's good. real good.

917
00:44:02.110 --> 00:44:03.960
- All right. I'm gonna be in my room.

918
00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:22.934
Yeah. man. I'm sitting down. what's up?

919
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.254
- So where would you find
the highest concentration

920
00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:28.274
of virgins this side
of the known universe.

921
00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:30.733
- I don't know. sitting
right behind your computer?

922
00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:35.274
- Ha. very funny. no.

923
00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:37.364
Remember that girl that I challenged

924
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:39.724
to that hot dog eating
contest in my pants?

925
00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:41.065
The one who slapped me?

926
00:44:41.131 --> 00:44:42.954
- (chuckles) Yeah. dude.
that was hilarious.

927
00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:43.820
Then you...

928
00:44:43.853 --> 00:44:45.924
- Yeah. where did she go to school?

929
00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:48.094
Yeah. remember. we
stopped her that one time?

930
00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:48.960
- Yeah. yeah. I remember.

931
00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:51.474
It was like Saint something.

932
00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:53.538
- Saint Agnes Catholic School

933
00:44:53.604 --> 00:44:56.143
for Girls!
- For Girls!

934
00:44:58.330 --> 00:44:59.973
- Hi.
- Hey.

935
00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:04.754
- So where's your new boyfriends.

936
00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:07.944
Ryan and that dork with the glasses?

937
00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:09.110
- I haven't seen them.

938
00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:13.284
- Tell you what. if you ever. ever

939
00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:14.800
embarrass me like that again!

940
00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:18.304
- Ow. you're hurting me.

941
00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:21.693
- No. you're only hurting yourself.

942
00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:26.830
- What are you looking at?

943
00:45:29.034 --> 00:45:32.510
(deep organ music)

944
00:45:32.576 --> 00:45:34.021
- Oh. here we go. here we go.

945
00:45:34.087 --> 00:45:36.984
- Where did you guys find this place?

946
00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:39.750
- Sure as hell didn't find
it in a fucking library.

947
00:45:39.816 --> 00:45:41.381
- Oh. this is gonna be fun.

948
00:45:41.447 --> 00:45:42.459
- Let's do this.

949
00:45:42.525 --> 00:45:46.108
(tense instrumental music)

950
00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:10.264
- Shit. man. they've got security.

951
00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:12.344
- Well. if you were
interested in preserving

952
00:46:12.410 --> 00:46:15.576
the hymens of 500 girls. wouldn't you...

953
00:46:15.642 --> 00:46:16.475
- Shut up.

954
00:46:17.596 --> 00:46:19.179
Oh. shit. let's go.

955
00:46:20.481 --> 00:46:21.501
- Okay.

956
00:46:21.567 --> 00:46:25.150
(tense instrumental music)

957
00:46:50.599 --> 00:46:52.366
- [Girl] Do something. come on!

958
00:46:52.432 --> 00:46:55.182
(girls shouting)

959
00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:58.497
- [Girl] Oh my gosh.

960
00:46:58.563 --> 00:46:59.363
You're so mean.

961
00:46:59.414 --> 00:47:02.331
(girls chattering)

962
00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:04.220
- [Girl] You suck.

963
00:47:04.253 --> 00:47:07.164
(girls chattering)

964
00:47:15.358 --> 00:47:16.859
- [Girl] Come on. really?

965
00:47:16.925 --> 00:47:20.675
(magical instrumental music)

966
00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:29.318
- [Girl] Ow. my face!

967
00:47:29.384 --> 00:47:31.734
- See. you have to pay attention.

968
00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:33.194
Your enemies are all around you.

969
00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:35.264
They try and get things from you.

970
00:47:35.330 --> 00:47:37.354
They want your goodies. and you must

971
00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:40.293
always protect yourselves.
ladies. at all times.

972
00:47:41.154 --> 00:47:44.499
(tense instrumental music)

973
00:47:44.565 --> 00:47:46.457
Okay. ladies. remember.
it's about winning.

974
00:47:46.523 --> 00:47:47.336
- Gimme the rock.

975
00:47:47.402 --> 00:47:48.588
- No.
- Come on. gimme the rock!

976
00:47:48.654 --> 00:47:49.801
Give me the rock!

977
00:47:49.867 --> 00:47:54.114
- And to be sure that no one. no one.

978
00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:55.703
gets your goodies.

979
00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:03.574
- Hi there.

980
00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:06.143
- [Justin] Hi. I've come for you.

981
00:48:08.801 --> 00:48:10.411
- You lucky bastard.

982
00:48:10.477 --> 00:48:12.041
- Why'd you give him the rock. man?

983
00:48:12.107 --> 00:48:14.724
- Can you believe this?

984
00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:16.296
- Allow me!

985
00:48:16.362 --> 00:48:18.223
- Oh. Jesus Christ!

986
00:48:19.352 --> 00:48:21.624
(gasping)

987
00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:24.584
Sorry. forgot. Catholic school.

988
00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:26.293
- I'll come back for you.
- Run. dude!

989
00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:28.834
- [Justin] Go. go. go!

990
00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:32.096
- Two JP's loose. on the run. copy!

991
00:48:32.162 --> 00:48:33.594
- JP's?

992
00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:35.302
- Juvenile perverts!

993
00:48:35.368 --> 00:48:39.201
(exciting instrumental music)

994
00:49:26.796 --> 00:49:29.207
- That was way too close. dude.

995
00:49:29.273 --> 00:49:30.073
How'd you get away?

996
00:49:30.106 --> 00:49:31.941
- I punched him. man.

997
00:49:32.007 --> 00:49:33.022
- Punched him?
- Yeah.

998
00:49:33.088 --> 00:49:34.030
- Dude!

999
00:49:34.096 --> 00:49:36.955
(toilet flushes)

1000
00:49:37.021 --> 00:49:38.240
No. no. no. no. no.

1001
00:49:38.306 --> 00:49:39.879
No. no. please. please don't scream.

1002
00:49:39.945 --> 00:49:41.742
(girl screams)

1003
00:49:41.808 --> 00:49:45.641
(exciting instrumental music)

1004
00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:52.827
- Hey. how are you?

1005
00:49:57.284 --> 00:49:58.534
Yeah. I'm good.

1006
00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:01.583
So are we still on for dinner tonight?

1007
00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:05.340
Oh. why is that?

1008
00:50:07.917 --> 00:50:08.897
- Hey.

1009
00:50:08.963 --> 00:50:10.118
- Hi.
- How are you?

1010
00:50:10.184 --> 00:50:12.184
- I'm good. how are you?

1011
00:50:15.424 --> 00:50:16.611
Fuck. call me!

1012
00:50:16.677 --> 00:50:20.510
(exciting instrumental music)

1013
00:51:36.261 --> 00:51:37.414
- Been looking for them for 20 minutes.

1014
00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:39.514
- 20 minutes. you mean we lost them?

1015
00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:41.004
- Yeah. or else we scared them off.

1016
00:51:41.070 --> 00:51:42.200
- Man.

1017
00:51:42.266 --> 00:51:43.084
- [Justin] Ow!

1018
00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:44.007
- What the?

1019
00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:49.323
- I can explain.

1020
00:51:54.610 --> 00:51:56.860
(laughing)

1021
00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:02.592
- Shit. man. where's Justin?

1022
00:52:02.658 --> 00:52:05.304
- I don't know. dude. he's
trapped behind enemy lines.

1023
00:52:05.370 --> 00:52:06.678
- He's fucked.

1024
00:52:06.744 --> 00:52:08.661
- Let's get outta here.

1025
00:52:10.590 --> 00:52:12.124
- You mean you have no library card.

1026
00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:13.894
no ID. no nothing?

1027
00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:18.180
- No. I lost it all at Mass.

1028
00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:22.544
- I'm going out to look for the others.

1029
00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:23.443
- Good idea.

1030
00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:27.224
- Jim. I think we can handle it from here.

1031
00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:29.274
Why don't you go ahead with Dwayne?

1032
00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:31.894
- Well. he's not armed. but.

1033
00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:35.804
- Jim. please. God will protect us.

1034
00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:38.103
- Okay. Sister. you're the boss.

1035
00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:47.234
- Look. sisters. I know.

1036
00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:49.723
I'm a really good kid. it's just. I don't.

1037
00:52:53.296 --> 00:52:55.359
Oh. Jesus Christ!

1038
00:52:55.425 --> 00:52:58.964
- Oh. my blessed son.

1039
00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:02.554
my hot. hot son!

1040
00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:04.020
- [Justin] Oh. Jesus Christ!

1041
00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:13.694
- Sister Pat. I can't believe you.

1042
00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:15.384
acting like a whore of Babylon.

1043
00:53:15.450 --> 00:53:17.334
- Don't you sister me. Sister!

1044
00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:20.063
I saw you and that
pornographic tongue of yours.

1045
00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:33.640
- Okay. so where are you now?

1046
00:53:34.917 --> 00:53:35.717
Are you okay. dude?

1047
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:36.880
You sound a little weird.

1048
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:39.694
Okay. okay. bye.

1049
00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:40.734
- So what's the dealio. man?

1050
00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:41.843
- Dude. he got away.

1051
00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:43.520
- Thank God.

1052
00:53:43.553 --> 00:53:45.223
- I will. turn this piece of shit around.

1053
00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:01.914
All right. so you at least
saved the rock. right?

1054
00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:02.813
- Yeah. here.

1055
00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:07.284
I'd rather have nothing
to do with it right now.

1056
00:54:07.350 --> 00:54:08.684
- Dude. what's wrong with him?

1057
00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:10.494
Maybe we should take him to
the hospital or something.

1058
00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:12.044
- No. dude. that's just
gonna freak him out.

1059
00:54:12.110 --> 00:54:13.554
and don't call his parents.

1060
00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:14.424
Just shut the fuck up.

1061
00:54:14.490 --> 00:54:16.044
- Are you sure you can't remember

1062
00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:18.503
anything after the guards
left the room. man?

1063
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:21.410
- I don't wanna talk about it.

1064
00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:29.744
I can't believe we cut all day of school.

1065
00:54:29.810 --> 00:54:32.364
we're sober. and we struck out.

1066
00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:33.824
- Dude. you gotta look at it this way.

1067
00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:35.494
We still have a magic rock that can

1068
00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:37.224
get us laid whenever we want.

1069
00:54:37.290 --> 00:54:39.607
- Yeah. all it's gotten me so
far is punched in the face.

1070
00:54:39.673 --> 00:54:42.424
- Man. I'm like scarred for life.

1071
00:54:42.490 --> 00:54:44.194
- That's it. dude. what
happened back there?

1072
00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:46.424
- I said I don't wanna talk about it.

1073
00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:47.290
- All right.

1074
00:54:47.323 --> 00:54:48.214
- The point is. we've had that rock

1075
00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:51.274
for like three days. and we
haven't done dick with it.

1076
00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:54.704
- Yeah. he's right. man. you
never even let me touch it.

1077
00:54:54.770 --> 00:54:55.570
- That's what she said.

1078
00:54:55.603 --> 00:54:56.883
- Cut the jokes. Wilson.

1079
00:54:58.378 --> 00:54:59.494
We just wanna get laid.

1080
00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:01.360
like any guys in our position would.

1081
00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:06.564
- All right. the Catholic
school thing was your idea.

1082
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:08.464
- That's not the point.

1083
00:55:08.530 --> 00:55:13.374
The point is I've never
gotten laid ever. all right?

1084
00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:14.744
There. I said it.

1085
00:55:14.810 --> 00:55:17.094
And society puts a lot of
pressure on a guy like me.

1086
00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:19.204
who won't feel normal
until he earns the right

1087
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:22.603
to say. sure. I had sex. so what?

1088
00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:26.904
- There's always Cindy's party tonight.

1089
00:55:26.970 --> 00:55:29.244
We sort of got invited.

1090
00:55:29.310 --> 00:55:31.314
I say we get in there and tap

1091
00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:34.384
some hot cheerleader ass
before the magic is gone.

1092
00:55:34.450 --> 00:55:36.679
- Now he is speaking my language.

1093
00:55:36.745 --> 00:55:37.704
- All right. all right. all right.

1094
00:55:37.770 --> 00:55:38.914
I'm gonna bring the rock tonight.

1095
00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:39.914
Are you happy?

1096
00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:41.963
I don't see how this is my fault. though.

1097
00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:45.173
- Woo!

1098
00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:58.341
- [Ryan] Dad!

1099
00:55:58.407 --> 00:55:59.454
- [Bill] Yeah. Ryan?

1100
00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:00.620
- Nothing. never mind.

1101
00:56:08.196 --> 00:56:09.113
Penicillin.

1102
00:56:10.697 --> 00:56:12.614
Rabies. who has rabies?

1103
00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:15.374
Scurvy?

1104
00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:16.490
What is he. a pirate?

1105
00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:21.193
Jackpot!

1106
00:56:29.926 --> 00:56:32.593
(pills clatter)

1107
00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:47.773
Nom don't come in. I'm not decent!

1108
00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:51.694
- Got a minute?

1109
00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:52.663
- Yeah. sure.

1110
00:56:56.784 --> 00:57:00.324
- Before you go out to wherever
you're gonna go tonight.

1111
00:57:00.390 --> 00:57:03.373
I wanted to talk to you
about your mom and me.

1112
00:57:06.570 --> 00:57:07.594
I guess you figured out by now

1113
00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:11.074
that the tension's
pretty thick around here.

1114
00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:12.190
- Yeah. a little bit.

1115
00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:14.987
- This is the part of the conversation

1116
00:57:15.053 --> 00:57:18.504
where the Dad manual
says I'm supposed to tell

1117
00:57:18.570 --> 00:57:19.914
you how everything's gonna be all right

1118
00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:21.773
and how you shouldn't worry.

1119
00:57:24.410 --> 00:57:25.860
But you're not a kid anymore.

1120
00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:28.873
You deserve better than that.

1121
00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:34.253
The truth is. your mom and me.

1122
00:57:34.319 --> 00:57:37.784
we've been talking. and. well.

1123
00:57:37.850 --> 00:57:39.950
I just don't know how it's gonna turn out.

1124
00:57:41.410 --> 00:57:43.754
- But you still love her. right?

1125
00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:47.143
- Yeah. yeah. of course. I
love her. I love your mom.

1126
00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:49.973
Your mom is a wonderful woman.

1127
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:52.853
She's a beautiful woman.

1128
00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:56.644
I probably should've told her that

1129
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:58.143
more often than I did.

1130
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:05.870
But this marriage. it's like the old song.

1131
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:10.243
the thrill is gone.

1132
00:58:17.864 --> 00:58:19.443
Listen. no matter what happens.

1133
00:58:20.349 --> 00:58:22.774
you know that your mom and I both.

1134
00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:24.354
we love you very much.

1135
00:58:24.420 --> 00:58:25.453
- Yeah. sure. Dad.

1136
00:58:26.522 --> 00:58:27.522
- All right.

1137
00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:34.341
- Thanks for being so
straight with me. Dad.

1138
00:58:34.407 --> 00:58:35.393
- Any time. buddy.

1139
00:58:38.790 --> 00:58:41.773
Ryan. your mom is right.

1140
00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:45.614
that guinea pig cage.

1141
00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:47.277
this room does smell like pee.

1142
00:59:03.839 --> 00:59:06.164
- All right. I think we're good.

1143
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:07.224
Ready?

1144
00:59:07.290 --> 00:59:08.534
- What's with all the sneaking around?

1145
00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:10.770
- If you must know. I got grounded

1146
00:59:12.410 --> 00:59:14.394
for what I said to Sumner.

1147
00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:16.114
- What exactly did you say to her?

1148
00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:18.134
- I asked her if she
wanted to go down on me

1149
00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:21.241
and suck my dick and
finger my butthole. okay?

1150
00:59:21.307 --> 00:59:23.144
- (chuckles) Jesus. dude.

1151
00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:25.560
- Yeah. I mean. I've
always wanted it done. so.

1152
00:59:27.370 --> 00:59:28.273
- With Sumner?

1153
00:59:29.290 --> 00:59:32.234
- Ah. no. dude. like in general.

1154
00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:33.100
- All right. that's what I thought.

1155
00:59:33.133 --> 00:59:34.753
because that bitch has big hands.

1156
00:59:38.615 --> 00:59:39.843
- [Justin] Look at this guy.

1157
00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:49.294
- [Ryan] What are you doing. shitass?

1158
00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:50.160
- [Justin] Yeah. get off that car.

1159
00:59:50.193 --> 00:59:50.993
You're gonna scratch it.

1160
00:59:51.026 --> 00:59:52.894
- [Ryan] Where's your van?

1161
00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:54.189
- This is my car.

1162
00:59:54.255 --> 00:59:55.055
(Justin laughs)

1163
00:59:55.088 --> 00:59:56.614
- Bullshit.
- Yeah. okay.

1164
00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:57.480
- Bullshit.
- You got a bunch

1165
00:59:57.513 --> 00:59:58.874
of keys. but that doesn't mean you're...

1166
00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:00.153
- Just get in.

1167
01:00:01.521 --> 01:00:03.771
- [Ryan] What the fuck.
where'd you get this?

1168
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:08.904
- You remember the money I
got from the massage parlor?

1169
01:00:08.970 --> 01:00:10.604
- No way. dude.
- Yeah.

1170
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:12.203
- Oh. so you can go out and buy a car

1171
01:00:12.269 --> 01:00:13.863
and you can't give me $65?

1172
01:00:15.090 --> 01:00:17.153
- [Sean] Come on. man. let's go.

1173
01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:19.894
- Fucking asshole. dude.

1174
01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:21.223
Just. let's go.

1175
01:00:22.690 --> 01:00:25.083
Hold on. (laughing)

1176
01:00:26.367 --> 01:00:28.867
(roof buzzes)

1177
01:00:30.163 --> 01:00:31.663
- That is so sexy.

1178
01:00:35.544 --> 01:00:36.461
Damn. dude.

1179
01:00:39.718 --> 01:00:40.518
I'm jealous.

1180
01:00:40.551 --> 01:00:41.611
- How are we not gonna
get laid in this thing?

1181
01:00:41.677 --> 01:00:43.244
- We will get laid in this thing.

1182
01:00:43.310 --> 01:00:45.744
- Anyways. anyways. who's
got something to drink.

1183
01:00:45.810 --> 01:00:49.368
'cause I got nothing. and
I need something. please.

1184
01:00:49.434 --> 01:00:52.604
- Well. I got these wine coolers.

1185
01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:54.993
My mom used to drink
them before my dad left.

1186
01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.082
- Well. maybe that's why he left.

1187
01:00:58.148 --> 01:01:00.574
(Ryan chuckles)

1188
01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:04.414
- [Sean] Dude. dude. don't
get it all over my car. man.

1189
01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:05.734
Well. what do you have?

1190
01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:07.534
- I got pills!

1191
01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:09.683
I think they're prescription.

1192
01:01:10.548 --> 01:01:11.348
- Prescription?
- Yeah.

1193
01:01:11.381 --> 01:01:13.094
- Here. hold this.

1194
01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:13.993
- Dude.

1195
01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:16.714
Yeah.
- What is this

1196
01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:17.884
brown stuff in here?

1197
01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:19.414
- It's hedgehog shit. but.

1198
01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:20.313
- Oh!
- Dude. what?

1199
01:01:22.550 --> 01:01:24.114
- It's not even that important.

1200
01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:25.113
Let's just dig in.

1201
01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:29.204
That's pussy shit.
- How is it?

1202
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:31.083
- That is pussy shit.
- Okay. man.

1203
01:01:32.130 --> 01:01:36.683
Well. no one wants your
little shit medicine.

1204
01:01:37.830 --> 01:01:39.494
(laughing)

1205
01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:40.663
How's that taste?

1206
01:01:41.890 --> 01:01:43.275
Terrible?

1207
01:01:43.341 --> 01:01:46.341
(heavy metal music)

1208
01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:52.893
- Are we good?

1209
01:01:57.296 --> 01:01:59.434
What the fuck are you doing?

1210
01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:01.324
- Dancing. man. what does it look like?

1211
01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:02.984
- It looks like you're
having a goddamn seizure

1212
01:02:03.050 --> 01:02:04.354
is what it looks like.

1213
01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:05.881
- Okay. okay. man. just give me the rock

1214
01:02:05.947 --> 01:02:07.513
so I can get some cock.

1215
01:02:08.778 --> 01:02:10.728
- Did he just say what I think he said?

1216
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:14.494
- I mean so I can give her some cock.

1217
01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:15.454
- All right. that's what I thought.

1218
01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:16.914
All right. you're gonna go in there.

1219
01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:18.494
you're gonna find the first
girl you want. all right?

1220
01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.134
Otherwise. you're gonna
have honeys all over you.

1221
01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:21.644
- Right.
- You wanna be careful.

1222
01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:24.024
otherwise. we're gonna score
a big fat zero on this.

1223
01:02:24.090 --> 01:02:25.290
You got it?
- I got it.

1224
01:02:26.242 --> 01:02:27.075
- All right.

1225
01:02:29.730 --> 01:02:31.130
What the fuck are you doing?

1226
01:02:32.050 --> 01:02:34.800
- It's cologne. man. I wanna
smell nice for the ladies.

1227
01:02:36.050 --> 01:02:37.824
- Would you just get your
ass in there. all right?

1228
01:02:37.890 --> 01:02:38.690
And make sure you come back

1229
01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:40.204
as soon as you're done
taking care of business

1230
01:02:40.270 --> 01:02:42.444
so we can have a turn.
- Okay.

1231
01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:45.304
- If you so much as look at
Amber. I'll fucking kill you.

1232
01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:46.170
You got it?

1233
01:02:46.203 --> 01:02:49.354
- Okay. man. does my hair look good?

1234
01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:50.220
- It looks terrible.

1235
01:02:50.253 --> 01:02:51.614
- What the fuck does it matter?

1236
01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:53.524
It's a sure goddamned thing.

1237
01:02:53.590 --> 01:02:55.090
Get your ass in there already!

1238
01:02:56.206 --> 01:02:57.506
- Okay. man. wish me luck.

1239
01:02:58.420 --> 01:02:59.253
- Good luck.

1240
01:03:00.737 --> 01:03:01.904
- [Sean] Yeah!

1241
01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:05.143
- He is so fucked.

1242
01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.164
- [Sean] Woo!

1243
01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:09.593
- Which means we're fucked.

1244
01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:13.584
- Why the fuck did we give him
the rock in the first place?

1245
01:03:13.650 --> 01:03:14.894
We just screwed ourselves!

1246
01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:16.843
Oh my fucking God. dude!

1247
01:03:21.043 --> 01:03:24.314
- I have some drinks downstairs
if you wanna go grab some.

1248
01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:25.314
I'll be right there.

1249
01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:26.770
Hey. wait!

1250
01:03:26.836 --> 01:03:27.636
- [Boy] Who the fuck was that?

1251
01:03:27.669 --> 01:03:28.919
- Some wieners.

1252
01:03:33.261 --> 01:03:34.884
- Hey. Sean. right?

1253
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:37.764
- Yeah. Tammy from geometry.

1254
01:03:37.830 --> 01:03:39.566
- Yeah. did you just get here?

1255
01:03:39.632 --> 01:03:40.965
- Uh. uh...
- Huh?

1256
01:03:43.466 --> 01:03:44.299
Are you okay?

1257
01:03:47.230 --> 01:03:48.823
You disgusting creep!

1258
01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:52.273
- Wait a minute. you're not a virgin?

1259
01:03:53.369 --> 01:03:54.169
- I never!

1260
01:03:54.202 --> 01:03:55.224
(Sean groans)

1261
01:03:55.290 --> 01:03:58.134
What business is it of yours anyways?

1262
01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:00.033
You have a lot of nerve. asshole.

1263
01:04:02.044 --> 01:04:03.677
And if you ever tell
anyone about me fucking

1264
01:04:03.743 --> 01:04:06.943
Matt Waite at the carnival.
I'll fucking kill you.

1265
01:04:10.759 --> 01:04:12.373
- Bitches be crazy. right?

1266
01:04:13.888 --> 01:04:16.805
(funky rock music)

1267
01:04:33.610 --> 01:04:34.653
- Hey. handsome.

1268
01:04:35.530 --> 01:04:37.704
- Oh. hey. Sally.

1269
01:04:37.770 --> 01:04:40.584
You here with someone?

1270
01:04:40.650 --> 01:04:41.977
- I'm here with you.

1271
01:04:44.810 --> 01:04:47.733
You know. there's a back room with a sofa.

1272
01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:52.094
- Are you drunk. 'cause I could...

1273
01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:53.713
- No. follow me.

1274
01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:08.211
Is this okay?

1275
01:05:08.277 --> 01:05:10.703
- Oh. yeah. it's nice.

1276
01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:14.253
Do you come here a lot?

1277
01:05:19.537 --> 01:05:20.344
- Hmm?

1278
01:05:20.410 --> 01:05:22.133
- Have you been here before?

1279
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:35.123
Uh. uh. Sally. can I ask you a question?

1280
01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:37.573
- Sure.

1281
01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:45.040
- You've done this. I've
never done this before.

1282
01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:47.513
So why me?

1283
01:05:50.651 --> 01:05:52.463
- You seem nice.

1284
01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:57.037
The opposite of most guys I've been with.

1285
01:06:01.370 --> 01:06:05.134
It turns out. most guys really are pigs.

1286
01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:06.823
- I'm not a pig. am I?

1287
01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:12.094
- If you're asking the question

1288
01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:14.733
because you think that you might be one.

1289
01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:18.414
it means you have a conscience

1290
01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:23.480
and. therefore. no. you
definitely are not a pig.

1291
01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:27.300
- That's good to know.

1292
01:06:50.490 --> 01:06:54.444
- What do you think. who do
you think he's doing in there?

1293
01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:55.510
- I don't know. man.

1294
01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:57.794
I swear to God. if he loses that rock

1295
01:06:57.860 --> 01:06:59.734
or gets caught or something!

1296
01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:01.614
- Dude. you're freaking out. right. man?

1297
01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:02.594
Chill. it'll be all right.

1298
01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:03.924
- It shouldn't take him
more than 10 seconds.

1299
01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:04.974
He should be out here by now.

1300
01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:06.563
- Maybe he's doubling up.

1301
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:10.733
- All right. it's 10:40. I'm going in.

1302
01:07:12.210 --> 01:07:13.043
- Let's do this!

1303
01:07:17.570 --> 01:07:19.987
(chattering)

1304
01:07:26.598 --> 01:07:28.106
- One more time. one more time.

1305
01:07:28.172 --> 01:07:31.021
(chattering)

1306
01:07:31.087 --> 01:07:32.004
- You suck!

1307
01:07:35.085 --> 01:07:37.335
(shouting)

1308
01:07:39.011 --> 01:07:41.959
- Oh. way to like spill it on my back.

1309
01:07:42.025 --> 01:07:43.448
- I bet you like that. huh?

1310
01:07:43.514 --> 01:07:45.764
(shouting)

1311
01:07:51.188 --> 01:07:52.422
- Miss!

1312
01:07:52.488 --> 01:07:54.905
(chattering)

1313
01:07:57.068 --> 01:07:58.230
- You can do it. let's go!

1314
01:07:58.296 --> 01:07:59.096
- I got it.

1315
01:07:59.156 --> 01:08:01.406
(shouting)

1316
01:08:04.503 --> 01:08:06.384
- I am so fucking twisted.

1317
01:08:06.450 --> 01:08:08.174
This stuff is so amazing.

1318
01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:09.073
- It is.

1319
01:08:12.550 --> 01:08:14.914
Save some for me.
- Okay.

1320
01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:17.358
- Finish your game now. faggot.

1321
01:08:17.424 --> 01:08:18.257
- What the fuck?

1322
01:08:20.926 --> 01:08:22.454
- I can't believe she's not here yet.

1323
01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:25.159
- I know. can you believe
what she did with him?

1324
01:08:25.225 --> 01:08:26.617
Homewrecker.

1325
01:08:26.683 --> 01:08:27.909
- [Girl] Oh. hi. guys.

1326
01:08:27.975 --> 01:08:30.392
(chattering)

1327
01:08:34.367 --> 01:08:36.617
- Sorry about that!
- Okay.

1328
01:08:38.488 --> 01:08:39.655
And I'm drunk.

1329
01:08:40.574 --> 01:08:41.732
- Where'd you get that ball?

1330
01:08:41.798 --> 01:08:43.367
- Man. I took it from
the fucking pool table.

1331
01:08:43.433 --> 01:08:44.843
It's a shitty sport.

1332
01:08:46.780 --> 01:08:48.998
- Come on. come on. make this shot.

1333
01:08:49.064 --> 01:08:50.348
- All right. bitch.
- I got this. I got this.

1334
01:08:50.414 --> 01:08:52.145
- All right. move it.

1335
01:08:52.211 --> 01:08:55.232
(chattering)

1336
01:08:55.298 --> 01:08:56.298
Drunk bitch.

1337
01:08:57.961 --> 01:08:59.484
My quarter now.

1338
01:08:59.550 --> 01:09:01.277
- Hey. we need a replacement.

1339
01:09:01.343 --> 01:09:02.143
Anybody?

1340
01:09:02.176 --> 01:09:02.976
Hey!

1341
01:09:03.009 --> 01:09:03.945
Justin.
- Faggot.

1342
01:09:04.011 --> 01:09:04.811
- Come on.
- Me?

1343
01:09:04.844 --> 01:09:06.234
- [Matt] Come on.
Peterson. are you a pussy?

1344
01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:09.990
- Oh. fuck that. let's do this. come on.

1345
01:09:10.056 --> 01:09:11.698
- Come on.

1346
01:09:11.764 --> 01:09:12.597
All right.

1347
01:09:14.982 --> 01:09:15.982
We got this.

1348
01:09:17.148 --> 01:09:18.714
- [Party-Goer] You suck. you suck.

1349
01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:19.580
- No!
- Come on.

1350
01:09:19.627 --> 01:09:21.834
- [Matt] Someone gets
lost in the muscle sauce.

1351
01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:23.050
trying to play catcher.

1352
01:09:23.908 --> 01:09:25.382
- Hey. Amber.

1353
01:09:25.448 --> 01:09:26.494
- Hey.
- Hey.

1354
01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:27.824
This is an awesome party.

1355
01:09:27.890 --> 01:09:28.754
- Yeah.

1356
01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:31.183
- So Cindy's parents
don't mind about all this?

1357
01:09:31.249 --> 01:09:32.191
- They're in Barbados.

1358
01:09:32.257 --> 01:09:34.007
- Oh. that's awesome.

1359
01:09:35.370 --> 01:09:37.874
I was wondering. have you
seen Sean around anywhere?

1360
01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:39.133
- No. try outside.

1361
01:09:40.190 --> 01:09:43.284
- Yeah. I looked outside.
but what about upstairs?

1362
01:09:43.350 --> 01:09:44.411
- In the bedrooms?

1363
01:09:44.477 --> 01:09:46.394
(chuckling)

1364
01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:47.260
- Yeah.
- All I know

1365
01:09:47.293 --> 01:09:48.323
is I haven't seen him.

1366
01:09:48.389 --> 01:09:49.189
- All right.

1367
01:09:49.222 --> 01:09:50.514
Listen. I was wondering if maybe sometime

1368
01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:53.080
you wanted to go out to
dinner and a movie. maybe?

1369
01:09:53.978 --> 01:09:56.364
- Aw. thank you!

1370
01:09:56.430 --> 01:10:00.084
But. you know. I'm kinda seeing
Matt Waite right now. so.

1371
01:10:00.150 --> 01:10:01.984
- Yeah. I know. but I'm gonna

1372
01:10:02.050 --> 01:10:03.269
definitely see you later. okay?

1373
01:10:03.335 --> 01:10:05.352
- Okay.
- All right.

1374
01:10:05.418 --> 01:10:09.001
(pulsing electronic music)

1375
01:10:12.579 --> 01:10:16.717
- Okay. well. I'm going
to go freshen up a bit.

1376
01:10:18.850 --> 01:10:20.605
- I'll come find you.

1377
01:10:20.671 --> 01:10:21.471
- [Sally] Okay.

1378
01:10:21.507 --> 01:10:25.090
(pulsing electronic music)

1379
01:10:31.690 --> 01:10:32.532
- Hey!

1380
01:10:32.598 --> 01:10:36.348
(pulsing instrumental music)

1381
01:11:01.050 --> 01:11:02.480
You smell nice.

1382
01:11:02.546 --> 01:11:04.274
- (chuckles) Hey.

1383
01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:07.067
- Why haven't I ever noticed
you have such a cute ass?

1384
01:11:07.133 --> 01:11:08.654
(Sean chuckles nervously)

1385
01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:10.409
Come on. let me just suck it.

1386
01:11:10.475 --> 01:11:11.604
- Dude. dude. what are you doing?

1387
01:11:11.670 --> 01:11:12.623
What. dude!

1388
01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:14.630
Stop!

1389
01:11:14.663 --> 01:11:17.624
(Sean screams)
- Don't struggle.

1390
01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:18.844
- [Sean] This won't fly. I can't!

1391
01:11:18.910 --> 01:11:20.119
- Oh. Jesus. dude. throw me the rock.

1392
01:11:20.185 --> 01:11:20.985
get rid of it!

1393
01:11:21.018 --> 01:11:24.208
(pulsing electronic music)

1394
01:11:24.274 --> 01:11:25.502
- Oh my God. what the?

1395
01:11:25.568 --> 01:11:26.586
Oh my God!

1396
01:11:26.652 --> 01:11:30.235
(pulsing electronic music)

1397
01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:36.327
(chattering)

1398
01:11:38.079 --> 01:11:40.015
- Amber. Amber. come here.

1399
01:11:40.081 --> 01:11:43.271
I wanna show you something. come here.

1400
01:11:43.337 --> 01:11:44.224
Do you wanna go upstairs?

1401
01:11:44.290 --> 01:11:45.144
- Sure.

1402
01:11:45.210 --> 01:11:46.356
- All right. come here.

1403
01:11:46.422 --> 01:11:48.839
(chattering)

1404
01:11:51.463 --> 01:11:52.440
- Nothing.

1405
01:11:52.506 --> 01:11:54.154
(shouting)

1406
01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:56.452
- Diaz. let's go. Freddy!

1407
01:11:56.518 --> 01:11:57.987
Come on. take a little sip.

1408
01:11:58.053 --> 01:12:00.243
- [Matt] All right. all right. all right.

1409
01:12:00.309 --> 01:12:03.077
(shouting)

1410
01:12:03.143 --> 01:12:03.976
- Diaz!

1411
01:12:06.482 --> 01:12:07.587
- [Matt] All right. one
more. one more. one more.

1412
01:12:07.653 --> 01:12:08.584
one more. one more.

1413
01:12:08.650 --> 01:12:11.421
(chattering)

1414
01:12:11.487 --> 01:12:13.737
(shouting)

1415
01:12:18.744 --> 01:12:20.097
- [Party-Goers] Drink.
drink. drink. drink.

1416
01:12:20.163 --> 01:12:22.268
drink. drink. drink. drink. drink. drink.

1417
01:12:22.334 --> 01:12:23.266
drink. drink. drink. drink. drink. drink

1418
01:12:23.332 --> 01:12:26.515
drink. drink. drink. drink. drink.

1419
01:12:26.581 --> 01:12:28.831
(shouting)

1420
01:12:35.938 --> 01:12:40.438
(laughing)
(retching)

1421
01:12:41.519 --> 01:12:42.575
- [Party=goer] Oh my God!

1422
01:12:42.641 --> 01:12:44.536
- You mother-faggot.

1423
01:12:44.602 --> 01:12:45.994
My grandmother gave me this shirt.

1424
01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:47.251
What's wrong with you?

1425
01:12:47.317 --> 01:12:49.734
(chattering)

1426
01:12:52.109 --> 01:12:53.922
- Oh. get the fuck outta here!

1427
01:12:53.988 --> 01:12:57.468
(pulsing electronic music)

1428
01:12:57.534 --> 01:12:59.096
- Wait. wait. wait.

1429
01:12:59.162 --> 01:13:00.812
I actually kind of like the dark.

1430
01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:04.133
- Whatever you want. sweetie. anything.

1431
01:13:05.791 --> 01:13:09.374
(pulsing electronic music)

1432
01:13:15.790 --> 01:13:16.623
- Amber. wait.

1433
01:13:19.431 --> 01:13:22.624
- I want you to know.
I've never. you know.

1434
01:13:22.690 --> 01:13:24.574
- No. trust me. I know.

1435
01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:26.854
- It feels so strange.

1436
01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:28.311
- Strange like you don't wanna do this?

1437
01:13:28.377 --> 01:13:30.134
- No. of course. I do.

1438
01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:32.604
It's just I can't believe
you and I have never.

1439
01:13:32.670 --> 01:13:34.264
- That's because you really don't...

1440
01:13:34.330 --> 01:13:36.184
- Whatever you want. Ryan Wilson.

1441
01:13:36.250 --> 01:13:37.223
I'm yours.

1442
01:13:40.290 --> 01:13:41.123
- Amber. wait.

1443
01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:42.960
I can't do this.

1444
01:13:42.993 --> 01:13:44.114
- Is it me?

1445
01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:45.684
Oh. you want me to go down. okay.

1446
01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:46.550
- No. no. no. no.

1447
01:13:46.583 --> 01:13:49.413
I don't need you. I just
realized I don't have a condom.

1448
01:13:50.270 --> 01:13:51.814
- Are you serious?

1449
01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:53.184
Look. I'm so ready for this.

1450
01:13:53.250 --> 01:13:54.634
- No. Amber. trust me.

1451
01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:58.294
I am crazy about you. it's
just that this is wrong.

1452
01:13:58.360 --> 01:13:59.193
I'm sorry.

1453
01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:05.434
- [Justin] Oh my God. dude.

1454
01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:06.601
All right. all right.
all right. tell me. bro.

1455
01:14:06.667 --> 01:14:08.144
was it really wet?

1456
01:14:08.210 --> 01:14:11.624
- Yeah. and hot. but the good hot.

1457
01:14:11.690 --> 01:14:13.044
- [Justin] Oh my God. that is amazing!

1458
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:16.014
- Yeah. but you know. right?

1459
01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:18.774
- Oh. about Easy Beasley. yeah.
everybody knows about that.

1460
01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:20.134
I'm talking about Diaz almost getting

1461
01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:21.944
his mouth all over your dick. dude.

1462
01:14:22.010 --> 01:14:23.224
I heard you got some of that cock

1463
01:14:23.290 --> 01:14:24.890
you were talking about earlier.

1464
01:14:24.956 --> 01:14:26.004
- [Sean] Okay.

1465
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:29.434
- Oh. stud muffin. tell
me. was she amazing?

1466
01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:30.451
- Yeah. man. she was amazing.

1467
01:14:30.517 --> 01:14:31.814
- All right. well. you have to tell me

1468
01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:32.974
all about it later. but. for now.

1469
01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:35.647
please. give me the rock.

1470
01:14:35.713 --> 01:14:37.773
- I don't think it's
such a good idea. dude.

1471
01:14:38.846 --> 01:14:40.654
- What are you talking
about. are you fucking crazy?

1472
01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:41.604
- Yeah. fair is fair.

1473
01:14:41.670 --> 01:14:43.504
- Give me the goddamn rock.

1474
01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:44.537
- I couldn't do it. all right?

1475
01:14:44.603 --> 01:14:45.964
I pussyed out.

1476
01:14:46.030 --> 01:14:47.414
- Bullshit. you expect us to believe

1477
01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:49.494
that you didn't get with
the finest piece of ass

1478
01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:50.327
that goes to our high school?

1479
01:14:50.393 --> 01:14:52.834
- Dude. this is so wrong. all right?

1480
01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:55.244
These girls think that we're
untouchables. all right?

1481
01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:56.154
They don't even like us.

1482
01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:57.724
The only reason why they
wanna have sex with us

1483
01:14:57.790 --> 01:14:59.404
is because of this fucking rock.

1484
01:14:59.470 --> 01:15:01.513
It's like date rape. it's sick.

1485
01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:04.934
- Are you fucking crazy?

1486
01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.664
All of a sudden. you're a fucking saint?

1487
01:15:06.730 --> 01:15:08.384
Look. just because you
can't take advantage

1488
01:15:08.450 --> 01:15:10.884
of the best thing that's
ever happened to guys ever.

1489
01:15:10.950 --> 01:15:12.494
doesn't mean I feel the same way.

1490
01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:14.004
You and Sean had your chance.

1491
01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:15.654
Now give me the fucking
rock. it's my turn.

1492
01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:17.320
- I'm not giving it to you. man.

1493
01:15:19.133 --> 01:15:20.211
- [Justin] Give me the fucking rock.

1494
01:15:20.277 --> 01:15:22.071
- Get outta here. dude. I'm
not giving you the rock.

1495
01:15:22.137 --> 01:15:22.937
- If you don't give me that rock.

1496
01:15:22.970 --> 01:15:23.884
you're fucking dead. all right?

1497
01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:25.134
You're fucking dead!

1498
01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:27.360
- Well. you're just gonna
have to take it from me. man.

1499
01:15:30.268 --> 01:15:31.411
- [Justin] Give me the...

1500
01:15:31.477 --> 01:15:32.964
- Fuck. get off of me. man!

1501
01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:33.830
What's wrong with you?

1502
01:15:33.863 --> 01:15:34.961
(fleshy smack)
(grunting)

1503
01:15:35.027 --> 01:15:37.870
- Give me the fucking rock.
(fleshy smacks)

1504
01:15:38.862 --> 01:15:40.195
Fucking asshole.

1505
01:15:41.201 --> 01:15:42.284
Fucking shit.

1506
01:15:45.286 --> 01:15:48.703
(funky electronic music)

1507
01:15:51.683 --> 01:15:54.059
- Cindy. hey. you and me. upstairs.

1508
01:15:54.125 --> 01:15:55.272
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1509
01:15:55.338 --> 01:15:57.755
(chattering)

1510
01:16:03.554 --> 01:16:05.174
- It's weird. you know. man?

1511
01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:10.240
You and Justin have been
friends since like forever.

1512
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:11.110
- Yeah. well. we didn't know Diaz

1513
01:16:11.143 --> 01:16:12.780
was a gay virgin. either. did we?

1514
01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:15.633
- No.

1515
01:16:19.569 --> 01:16:21.404
- I think my parents are
getting a divorce. man.

1516
01:16:21.470 --> 01:16:22.763
- Shit. man.

1517
01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:25.623
I'm sorry.

1518
01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:27.847
What are you gonna do?

1519
01:16:27.913 --> 01:16:30.584
- Here's your fucking rock
back. you stupid pussy.

1520
01:16:30.650 --> 01:16:32.034
- Justin. where you going. man?

1521
01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:32.970
Ryan's...

1522
01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:37.324
What are we gonna do about the rock?

1523
01:16:37.390 --> 01:16:38.584
- I'll take care of it. dude.

1524
01:16:38.650 --> 01:16:39.534
- What are you gonna do with it?

1525
01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:41.100
- I said I'll take care of it!

1526
01:16:44.928 --> 01:16:47.845
(moody rock music)

1527
01:17:02.279 --> 01:17:07.279
♪ I don't want to go it alone ♪

1528
01:17:10.115 --> 01:17:13.254
♪ I don't want to go it alone ♪

1529
01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:14.153
- [Justin] Ryan.

1530
01:17:18.910 --> 01:17:20.234
- How'd you find me here?

1531
01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:22.744
- We've been best friends
since we were seven. dude.

1532
01:17:22.810 --> 01:17:24.010
You run when you're mad.

1533
01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:27.220
- What the fuck do you want?

1534
01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:30.814
- Just wanna say I'm sorry. dude.

1535
01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:33.904
I mean. last night. this
whole thing with the rock.

1536
01:17:33.970 --> 01:17:37.963
it's just I don't wanna
lose my best friend. right?

1537
01:17:39.570 --> 01:17:42.344
- Who sounds like the pussy now. huh?

1538
01:17:42.410 --> 01:17:44.583
- I guess I resemble that remark a little.

1539
01:17:45.450 --> 01:17:47.414
- A little like your baby Peterson?

1540
01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:48.563
- Fuck off. dude.

1541
01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:52.954
- Yeah. I guess we're cool.

1542
01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:54.347
- Good.

1543
01:17:54.413 --> 01:17:55.394
So I wanna tell you this new plan

1544
01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:56.560
about us getting laid.

1545
01:17:57.790 --> 01:18:00.454
- (chuckles) Do I even wanna hear this?

1546
01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:01.964
- Swingers clubs. dude.

1547
01:18:02.030 --> 01:18:03.294
All right. we pay 50 bucks.

1548
01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:05.014
and these wives just like split up

1549
01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:05.880
with their husbands for it.

1550
01:18:05.913 --> 01:18:07.874
- Where do you get these ideas?

1551
01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:09.154
- Where do I get all my ideas?

1552
01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:10.363
They just come to me.

1553
01:18:11.684 --> 01:18:12.517
- Right.

1554
01:18:14.851 --> 01:18:16.827
- All right. man. we good?

1555
01:18:16.893 --> 01:18:18.476
- Yeah.
- All right.

1556
01:18:20.090 --> 01:18:22.144
What'd you do with the rock. anyway?

1557
01:18:22.210 --> 01:18:24.034
- I figured we'd use it one last time.

1558
01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:24.954
I gave it to the two people who need

1559
01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:26.627
it way more than we do.
- Awesome.

1560
01:18:26.693 --> 01:18:29.110
(rock music)

1561
01:18:45.390 --> 01:18:46.740
- Well. that was the movie.

1562
01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:50.633
- I've seen better. I've gotta tell you.

1563
01:18:51.710 --> 01:18:53.657
No explosions. no car chases.

1564
01:18:53.723 --> 01:18:55.564
- Oh. please.

1565
01:18:55.630 --> 01:18:57.449
It was romantic. I loved it.

1566
01:18:57.515 --> 01:18:58.580
- Hey there. stud.

1567
01:18:58.646 --> 01:19:01.313
(girls chatter)

1568
01:19:03.734 --> 01:19:05.418
- What is this. what's going on?

1569
01:19:05.484 --> 01:19:06.965
- I told you. the ladies can't keep

1570
01:19:07.031 --> 01:19:07.831
their hands off me.

1571
01:19:07.864 --> 01:19:09.667
- Hey. beefcake.

1572
01:19:09.733 --> 01:19:11.797
- Come here. big daddy.

1573
01:19:11.863 --> 01:19:13.280
- How can you be?

1574
01:19:15.370 --> 01:19:17.504
Girls. ladies!

1575
01:19:17.570 --> 01:19:19.414
Let me make something clear.

1576
01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:23.594
He may not be perfect. we
may argue from time to time.

1577
01:19:23.660 --> 01:19:26.454
I may not always give him all
the attention he deserves.

1578
01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:28.384
but this is my man!

1579
01:19:28.450 --> 01:19:32.054
And nobody's allowed to put
their hands on him anywhere

1580
01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:36.034
or take him home and make
love to him. except me!

1581
01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:36.933
Now get out!

1582
01:19:41.645 --> 01:19:42.978
Come here. baby.

1583
01:19:52.271 --> 01:19:55.938
(sultry instrumental music)

1584
01:19:57.607 --> 01:20:00.203
Oh. Daddy. oh. Daddy.

1585
01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:03.394
Come here. tiger.

1586
01:20:03.460 --> 01:20:04.641
Whoa.

1587
01:20:04.707 --> 01:20:07.060
- Give me some of that jiggy-boo. baby.

1588
01:20:07.126 --> 01:20:09.376
(laughing)

1589
01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:13.880
- [Mom] You are hot. hot. hot!

1590
01:20:15.012 --> 01:20:15.845
Oh. baby!

1591
01:20:18.807 --> 01:20:20.284
- Well. Amber. I'm sorry
that you can't acknowledge

1592
01:20:20.350 --> 01:20:22.800
that Changling is the
greatest movie of all time.

1593
01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:27.734
No. I am being serious.
- Oh. baby!

1594
01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:29.833
- I can't hear you. it's my parents.

1595
01:20:31.090 --> 01:20:33.333
Anyways. are you going to Ava's party?

1596
01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:35.984
Nah. I heard it's supposed to be great.

1597
01:20:36.050 --> 01:20:37.682
I think they're getting a keg.

1598
01:20:37.748 --> 01:20:38.852
and I was thinking that maybe we could.

1599
01:20:38.918 --> 01:20:40.024
I don't know. go together?

1600
01:20:40.090 --> 01:20:41.014
- Okay.

1601
01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:41.913
- Yeah?

1602
01:20:47.147 --> 01:20:49.730
(water hisses)

1603
01:21:03.690 --> 01:21:05.944
- Are you sure you wanna do this?

1604
01:21:06.010 --> 01:21:07.110
- Yeah. I'm sure. man.

1605
01:21:08.110 --> 01:21:09.784
- What are we doing up here. anyway?

1606
01:21:09.850 --> 01:21:12.144
- It's a long story and. believe me.

1607
01:21:12.210 --> 01:21:14.160
if I told you. you wouldn't believe me.

1608
01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:17.850
- What's with the rock?

1609
01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:21.284
- Found it on Mr. Rosenbaum's field trip.

1610
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:22.183
It's a fetish.

1611
01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:24.474
- You mean like when you get off

1612
01:21:24.540 --> 01:21:26.824
from being choked during sex?

1613
01:21:26.890 --> 01:21:28.374
- Well. that's enough talk.

1614
01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:29.583
Let's just throw it.

1615
01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:32.314
- [Sally] Can I throw it?

1616
01:21:32.380 --> 01:21:33.213
- Yeah. sure.

1617
01:21:37.473 --> 01:21:40.144
Oh my God. Sally. anyone
ever tell you that...

1618
01:21:40.210 --> 01:21:42.023
- [Justin] The hottest girl ever.

1619
01:21:43.250 --> 01:21:45.414
- No. but thanks.

1620
01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:47.982
- Hey. I'd throw that thing if I were you.

1621
01:21:48.048 --> 01:21:48.881
- Okay.

1622
01:21:50.473 --> 01:21:53.056
(water hisses)

1623
01:21:58.827 --> 01:22:00.154
- You never did it.

1624
01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:01.307
- I couldn't after what you said.

1625
01:22:01.373 --> 01:22:04.754
It made me guilty. I got whisky dick.

1626
01:22:04.820 --> 01:22:07.694
- You mean neither of you two guys

1627
01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:09.353
actually did anything?

1628
01:22:09.419 --> 01:22:10.983
- What. what are we talking about?

1629
01:22:11.049 --> 01:22:12.564
What's going on?
- Nothing!

1630
01:22:12.630 --> 01:22:14.634
And when it comes to these two virgins.

1631
01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:15.653
I mean nothing.

1632
01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:18.126
Come on. let's go.

1633
01:22:18.192 --> 01:22:19.442
- [Sally] Okay.

1634
01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:23.184
- Oh. well. I guess that's that.

1635
01:22:23.250 --> 01:22:24.124
- Yeah.

1636
01:22:24.190 --> 01:22:26.064
Well. who needs magical powers anyway

1637
01:22:26.130 --> 01:22:27.794
when you're all that?

1638
01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:29.804
- I mean. right. we'll get
laid when the time's right.

1639
01:22:29.870 --> 01:22:31.234
- Yeah.

1640
01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:32.614
- So tell me about this swingers thing.

1641
01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:34.914
- Oh yeah. it's advertised online.

1642
01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:38.104
These married chicks. right.
they swap partners and stuff.

1643
01:22:38.170 --> 01:22:39.944
- Wait. wait. wait. how old are they?

1644
01:22:40.010 --> 01:22:41.494
- I'm pretty sure they wouldn't appreciate

1645
01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:44.720
us asking that. but.
anyway. these married.

1646
01:22:46.677 --> 01:22:50.094
(percussive rock music)
