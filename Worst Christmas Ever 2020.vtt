That'll be all?

38
00:04:09.842 --> 00:04:11.010
It'll be $10.99.

39
00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:26.659
Would you like a bag with that?

40
00:04:30.096 --> 00:04:31.097
Do you have a bathroom?

Oh.

Sophia!

54
00:06:08.728 --> 00:06:13.065
Me-a Sophia. you stole my heart

55
00:06:13.165 --> 00:06:16.635
and then I sharded.

56
00:06:16.736 --> 00:06:18.671
- Sophia!
- Oh. my God.

57
00:06:19.105 --> 00:06:20.006
What's you doing?

58
00:06:20.873 --> 00:06:22.574
Walking. what does it look like?

59
00:06:22.808 --> 00:06:24.243
It looks like
you could use a lift.

60
00:06:24.343 --> 00:06:25.644
You could use a car.

61
00:06:26.045 --> 00:06:28.247
Well. I got
my driver's permit last week

62
00:06:28.347 --> 00:06:29.882
and I've been
delivering papers. so...

63
00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.885
my uncle's Sunfire
will be mine in no time.

64
00:06:32.985 --> 00:06:34.153
- Oh. yeah?
- Yeah.

65
00:06:35.121 --> 00:06:38.791
By then I bet you could use
a ride but I might be too busy.

66
00:06:38.891 --> 00:06:40.826
I thought you were in love with me?

67
00:06:40.926 --> 00:06:42.594
Now you're going to be too busy.

68
00:06:42.695 --> 00:06:45.297
I was in love in you.
that was last year.

69
00:06:45.398 --> 00:06:47.933
Plus. I heard you're
with Trey Davis now.

70
00:06:48.034 --> 00:06:49.969
We broke up. Kind of.

71
00:06:50.936 --> 00:06:53.239
- I figured.
- What's that suppose to mean?

72
00:06:53.739 --> 00:06:57.109
Well. when I was coming here.
I passed Madison Fatchek's house

73
00:06:57.209 --> 00:06:59.912
and as soon as her dad
leaves. I see him walk in.

74
00:07:00.346 --> 00:07:01.781
Fatchick. Fatchek?

75
00:07:01.881 --> 00:07:03.215
She's not so fat anymore.

76
00:07:04.016 --> 00:07:06.218
I heard she got
her stomach stapled.

77
00:07:07.153 --> 00:07:09.288
Jimmy Stam says that
she's anorexic.

78
00:07:09.388 --> 00:07:10.990
She's probably bulimic.

79
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.893
Those titties. still fat though.

80
00:07:16.929 --> 00:07:18.631
You're so gross!

81
00:07:18.731 --> 00:07:19.965
Just saying.

82
00:07:20.066 --> 00:07:21.566
Isn't her dad a cop?

83
00:07:21.667 --> 00:07:24.203
He's a detective and Jimmy Stam

84
00:07:24.303 --> 00:07:26.806
told me that she helps
her cousin sell weed

85
00:07:26.906 --> 00:07:28.274
and he doesn't detect shit.

86
00:07:28.741 --> 00:07:30.209
That must be where Trey's
been getting faded.

87
00:07:32.144 --> 00:07:33.312
He's probably getting
more than just weed.

88
00:07:35.347 --> 00:07:37.149
- Stop.
- What?

89
00:07:37.683 --> 00:07:38.583
Your shoe's untied.

90
00:07:39.418 --> 00:07:41.287
The stupid thing
keeps coming undone.

91
00:07:44.857 --> 00:07:45.991
You should double knot it.

92
00:07:46.092 --> 00:07:47.093
You should hold on.

107
00:09:12.077 --> 00:09:13.879
- He got fired.

108
00:09:13.979 --> 00:09:15.214
I know. Right?

109
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:19.685
What are you doing tonight?

110
00:09:20.853 --> 00:09:23.055
- I don't know.
- My parents are going to the casino

111
00:09:23.155 --> 00:09:24.757
and I know where
they keep their booze

112
00:09:24.857 --> 00:09:27.426
if you want to go back to
my place and Netflix and chill.

113
00:09:28.027 --> 00:09:30.462
- I can't.
- Yeah. right. whatever.

114
00:09:31.463 --> 00:09:32.331
Noah.

115
00:09:33.399 --> 00:09:34.266
Noah!

116
00:09:40.973 --> 00:09:42.274
Why don't you
cook dinner for once?

117
00:09:42.374 --> 00:09:43.442
Because I don't want to.

118
00:09:43.542 --> 00:09:45.077
Why don't you
get off my nutsack?

119
00:09:45.177 --> 00:09:46.412
You are such a prick.

120
00:09:47.647 --> 00:09:49.782
- You want me to turn off the power again?
- Woman. please.

121
00:09:49.882 --> 00:09:51.984
How many times we have to
go through this. Rayjon?

122
00:09:52.084 --> 00:09:55.387
We need to save money. get that
through your freaking skull.

123
00:09:55.487 --> 00:09:57.790
Yeah. and how much that outfit
cost at Penny's yesterday?

124
00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:59.358
- I got that for work.
- Sure you did.

125
00:09:59.458 --> 00:10:01.260
You really think it cost
more than those golf clubs

126
00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.728
you got out in the garage?

127
00:10:03.395 --> 00:10:04.997
Again with the golf clubs.

128
00:10:05.097 --> 00:10:07.299
What'd you think. you were
Tiger Woods or something?

129
00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:09.735
You're going to sell those
things tomorrow. you hear me?

130
00:10:09.835 --> 00:10:10.736
No. I ain't.

131
00:10:10.836 --> 00:10:12.171
If you don't then I will.

132
00:10:12.271 --> 00:10:14.006
Go to work. Theresa.

133
00:10:14.106 --> 00:10:16.275
At least I got a job.
you freaking deadbeat.

134
00:10:18.544 --> 00:10:20.379
What did you say?

135
00:10:23.249 --> 00:10:26.151
Eat... a... dick.

136
00:10:28.153 --> 00:10:29.255
That's got
a good beat to it. right?

137
00:10:29.355 --> 00:10:31.423
Real mature.
say it a little louder

138
00:10:31.523 --> 00:10:32.358
so the kids can hear you.

139
00:10:34.593 --> 00:10:37.963
Eat a dick. eat a dick.
take a big old bite.

140
00:10:38.063 --> 00:10:39.164
or a little lick.

141
00:10:39.431 --> 00:10:41.133
I should record that
right there.

142
00:10:49.408 --> 00:10:50.943
<i>We've all had a shitty Christmas</i>

143
00:10:51.043 --> 00:10:53.078
<i>at one time or another. right?</i>

144
00:11:01.086 --> 00:11:03.422
<i>Like. when I was four years old</i>

145
00:11:04.023 --> 00:11:07.793
<i>my dumbass daddy robbed
a Quick Mart twice.</i>

146
00:11:08.894 --> 00:11:11.797
<i>Ask my mom about that Christmas.
and all she'll say</i>

147
00:11:11.897 --> 00:11:14.566
<i>is. "He didn't get me
nothing that year."</i>

148
00:11:14.668 --> 00:11:16.468
Why are you bitching at me?

149
00:11:16.568 --> 00:11:19.471
Because you didn't get me
nothing for Christmas this year.

150
00:11:19.571 --> 00:11:21.006
you cheap son of a bitch.

151
00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:25.544
- Wait. what time is it?
- It's 11:53.

152
00:11:25.645 --> 00:11:28.347
Well. it ain't
Christmas morning yet.

153
00:11:30.449 --> 00:11:32.017
Where you going?

154
00:11:32.117 --> 00:11:33.819
The night is young. Theresa.

155
00:11:33.919 --> 00:11:35.321
The night is not young.

156
00:11:35.421 --> 00:11:37.056
it's Christmas freaking Eve.

157
00:11:37.156 --> 00:11:40.092
You can't get nothing now.
every where's closed.

158
00:11:40.592 --> 00:11:42.361
We'll see about that.

159
00:11:50.302 --> 00:11:54.306
- Nefantarter. holy shit. is that you?
- Yeah.

160
00:11:54.406 --> 00:11:57.209
You look good. man.

161
00:11:57.309 --> 00:11:59.078
Yeah. yeah. I'm good.

162
00:11:59.178 --> 00:12:02.348
You need anything. man.
I got ups and downs.

163
00:12:02.448 --> 00:12:05.984
- and loopty-loos.
- No. thanks. man.

164
00:12:06.085 --> 00:12:08.120
I told you I'm good.

165
00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.190
Been clean for two years.
You ain't noticed?

166
00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:15.127
Two... two years. it's been
that long. holy shit. man.

167
00:12:15.227 --> 00:12:20.165
I remember when you were
everyday. twice a day.

168
00:12:20.265 --> 00:12:22.067
Yeah. not anymore.

169
00:12:22.501 --> 00:12:25.504
Hey. hey. didn't you
go to jail or some shit

170
00:12:25.604 --> 00:12:27.106
for leaving your kid in the car

171
00:12:27.206 --> 00:12:30.042
while you were getting
a handy at the Rub & Tug?

172
00:12:31.343 --> 00:12:33.879
Yeah. I was all doped out

173
00:12:33.979 --> 00:12:35.881
on that crystal blue
shit back then.

174
00:12:36.448 --> 00:12:39.418
Oh. yeah. crystal blue.

175
00:12:39.518 --> 00:12:42.020
I got that
crystal blue shit. man.

176
00:12:44.056 --> 00:12:45.290
Not anymore.

177
00:12:56.034 --> 00:13:00.439
I know what you like. mama.
you like that white chocolate.

178
00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:08.280
- $1.87.
- $1.87?

179
00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:12.084
- Yes.
- Uh. that's a bit steep. ain't it?

180
00:13:12.184 --> 00:13:16.188
- Tax.
- Yeah. yeah. tax my ass.

181
00:13:16.723 --> 00:13:19.391
Shit. I forgot my wallet.

182
00:13:21.994 --> 00:13:24.430
I'll tell you what. you pay me.

183
00:13:25.297 --> 00:13:27.634
- What?
- You pay me.

184
00:13:28.267 --> 00:13:29.935
Come on. open the register.

185
00:13:33.439 --> 00:13:36.275
Open the register.

186
00:13:39.211 --> 00:13:42.581
Next time you should. uh.
catch it with your hands. not your face.

187
00:13:44.016 --> 00:13:45.951
Come on. come on.
underneath too.

188
00:13:46.653 --> 00:13:49.955
Holy Christmas tits!

189
00:13:50.055 --> 00:13:51.290
Is this for me?

190
00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:53.325
Be a good little elf

191
00:13:53.425 --> 00:13:55.127
and put it all in Santa's sack.

192
00:13:56.094 --> 00:13:57.129
Uh-uh.

193
00:13:59.331 --> 00:14:03.001
Hey. uh. sorry about your eye.

194
00:14:15.481 --> 00:14:17.015
<i>My daddy took all that money.</i>

195
00:14:17.616 --> 00:14:19.117
<i>and put it straight in his arm.</i>

196
00:14:20.385 --> 00:14:22.387
Oh. shit.

197
00:14:33.766 --> 00:14:36.502
Ah. I forgot the goddamn candy.

198
00:14:41.774 --> 00:14:43.575
And I tell him. don't
you ever come back here.

199
00:14:43.676 --> 00:14:46.044
or I'll kick your
shitty little ass. punk.

200
00:14:50.817 --> 00:14:54.353
I forgot my candy
bar. but since I'm here.

201
00:14:54.453 --> 00:14:58.524
why don't you do me a favor
and give me your wallet?

202
00:14:58.624 --> 00:15:01.426
Please. sir. you've
already robbed us once.

203
00:15:01.861 --> 00:15:05.330
No. I already robbed him.

204
00:15:10.235 --> 00:15:11.738
Damn.

205
00:15:12.337 --> 00:15:14.273
I'm sorry.
none of you guys can catch.

206
00:15:14.373 --> 00:15:16.441
that's too bad.

207
00:15:18.878 --> 00:15:22.447
Merry Christmas. fellas.

208
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:47.139
Oh. oh. there it is. oh. oh.

209
00:15:54.681 --> 00:15:56.849
You cheap son of a bitch.

210
00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:57.817
Theresa.

211
00:15:58.685 --> 00:15:59.418
You didn't get me nothing

212
00:15:59.986 --> 00:16:00.653
for Christmas this year.

213
00:16:01.353 --> 00:16:02.120
Uh. that's not true.

214
00:16:03.522 --> 00:16:06.291
I. I got you
your favorite candy bar.

215
00:16:08.628 --> 00:16:10.730
Eat it. Daddy.

216
00:16:25.678 --> 00:16:26.679
I want candy.

217
00:16:31.216 --> 00:16:32.819
Oh. Oh!

218
00:16:32.919 --> 00:16:35.554
- What kind are you going to get?
- Peanut butter.

219
00:16:36.388 --> 00:16:37.489
I'm going to get caramel.

220
00:16:37.589 --> 00:16:39.458
You should try
the white chocolate.

221
00:16:39.558 --> 00:16:42.327
Mm. It's delicious.

222
00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:52.672

He sounds like a nuub.

231
00:17:14.827 --> 00:17:15.762
What'd you say?

232
00:17:16.228 --> 00:17:18.463
Yeah. total nuub.

Man. shut up.

00:17:32.511 --> 00:17:35.180
- He sucks.
- You all think you all are bad?

239
00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.916
I ought to kick both of
your asses when I see you all.

240
00:17:37.016 --> 00:17:38.316
You best believe that.

241
00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:39.819
Come on. boys.
let's go to the mall.

242
00:17:40.753 --> 00:17:42.421
Who wants to see Santa?

243
00:17:44.623 --> 00:17:47.592
Yay!

244
00:17:55.968 --> 00:17:57.970
What?

245
00:17:58.071 --> 00:18:00.372
- Sophia.
- Go away!

246
00:18:01.306 --> 00:18:02.842
Is everything
all right. sweetie?

247
00:18:05.277 --> 00:18:06.946
You have to work
on Christmas Eve?

248
00:18:07.046 --> 00:18:09.614
Yeah. we're doing
inventory today.

249
00:18:10.016 --> 00:18:11.818
I could use the extra hours.

250
00:18:12.551 --> 00:18:14.252
I'll be home by 11. don't worry.

251
00:18:15.287 --> 00:18:17.824
Just makes sure dickhead downstairs
cooks something for dinner.

252
00:18:19.591 --> 00:18:20.927
- Did you hear me?
- Yes!

253
00:18:22.527 --> 00:18:24.229
You don't mind
if I borrow these. do you?

254
00:18:24.864 --> 00:18:26.331
I'll give them back. I swear.

255
00:18:28.567 --> 00:18:30.602
What's the matter. is it Trey?

256
00:18:31.603 --> 00:18:32.471
What did he do now?

257
00:18:32.571 --> 00:18:34.006
Mind your own business.

258
00:18:34.741 --> 00:18:36.642
I was a teenager
once too. you know?

259
00:18:37.609 --> 00:18:38.644
Until I got pregnant.

260
00:18:39.411 --> 00:18:40.913
Anyways. been there done that.

261
00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.547
I'm always here
if you need to talk.

262
00:18:43.716 --> 00:18:46.318
- Mom.
- Oh. no. I can't right now. honey. I got to go.

263
00:18:47.352 --> 00:18:49.454
Do me a favor though. stop by
and see your grandparents today.

264
00:18:49.756 --> 00:18:52.457
- Do I have to?
- Yes. you have to.

265
00:18:52.959 --> 00:18:55.494
- Why?
- Because they're old.

266
00:18:55.594 --> 00:18:57.295
and they live.
like. five blocks away

267
00:18:57.395 --> 00:18:58.664
and they're probably
going to die soon.

268
00:18:59.766 --> 00:19:01.667
- And because I said so.
- Whatever!

269
00:19:01.768 --> 00:19:03.268
You don't think Grandma
could use the extra help.

270
00:19:03.736 --> 00:19:05.037
Malecia was supposed
to come over.

271
00:19:05.638 --> 00:19:07.907
So go later.
they'd love to see you.

272
00:19:08.007 --> 00:19:10.009
Fine. I'll go
but it's total bullshit.

273
00:19:10.109 --> 00:19:13.445
- Sophia Hendrix. so help me. God.
- That is not my name.

274
00:19:13.545 --> 00:19:15.982
Girl. sometimes I swear you act
like a spoiled little twat.

275
00:19:16.682 --> 00:19:18.350
If you want to keep
your daddy's last name

276
00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:20.820
and be known as the daughter
as an OD'd smack addict.

277
00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.388
go ahead but don't come
crying to me again

278
00:19:23.488 --> 00:19:24.791
when they start
bullying you in school.

279
00:19:26.125 --> 00:19:27.794
Great. now I'm really
going to be late.

280
00:19:28.393 --> 00:19:29.327
Can I use this?

281
00:19:31.731 --> 00:19:32.665
I love you. sweetie.

282
00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.650
Hey. I remember you.
you live on Easy Street. right?

283
00:19:51.651 --> 00:19:53.085
Your mama like jewelry?

284
00:19:53.186 --> 00:19:54.854
She got any diamonds?

285
00:19:55.453 --> 00:19:58.024
Hey. where
the hoe. hoe. hoes at?

286
00:19:58.124 --> 00:20:00.458
How about I take you
home with me tonight?

287
00:20:00.559 --> 00:20:02.094
Could be my elf on the shelf.

288
00:20:02.895 --> 00:20:03.930
No. thanks.

289
00:20:04.462 --> 00:20:05.932
You ain't even my type.

290
00:20:15.975 --> 00:20:17.710
Okay. everybody.
let's take a little break.

291
00:20:20.746 --> 00:20:23.049
I'm sorry. folks. I just
need a word with old St. Nick.

292
00:20:23.983 --> 00:20:25.350
We'll be open in ten minutes.

293
00:20:26.518 --> 00:20:28.486
It's bad enough you show up
three sheets to the wind.

294
00:20:28.587 --> 00:20:31.590
You smell like you parked your
sleigh up Rudolph's rotten asshole.

295
00:20:31.691 --> 00:20:34.961
and you definitely can't smoke
the wacky tobacy here.

296
00:20:35.995 --> 00:20:37.063
not in my mall.

297
00:20:41.067 --> 00:20:42.467
You got something to say to me?

298
00:20:44.971 --> 00:20:46.973

321
00:22:08.921 --> 00:22:10.622
Hi. Mr. Hendricks.
is Sophia home?

322
00:22:13.225 --> 00:22:14.160
Yeah. she upstairs.

323
00:22:15.861 --> 00:22:17.029
Hi. Malecia.

324
00:22:19.597 --> 00:22:23.069
Oh. what now. sucker?

325
00:22:23.169 --> 00:22:24.637
Wait. that's not fair.

326
00:22:24.737 --> 00:22:26.072
Who is it?

327
00:22:26.172 --> 00:22:27.673
It's me. open up.

328
00:22:32.544 --> 00:22:34.612
Thank you so
much for coming over.

329
00:22:34.714 --> 00:22:36.481
Anything for my BFF.

330
00:22:43.823 --> 00:22:46.624
Oh. God. your stepbrother
is such a freak.

331
00:22:47.193 --> 00:22:48.560
Why. what'd he do now?

332
00:22:48.995 --> 00:22:51.063
Notta. boy's just whack.

333
00:22:52.231 --> 00:22:55.267
You have no idea. he sits
down there playing games

334
00:22:55.368 --> 00:22:58.570
all day because
he has. like. zero friends.

335
00:22:58.671 --> 00:23:00.139
What about the little boy
from down the street.

336
00:23:00.239 --> 00:23:02.008
uh... Franki. what's his face?

337
00:23:02.108 --> 00:23:03.642
Oh. RJ kicked
the crap out of him.

338
00:23:03.743 --> 00:23:05.878
so now Mrs. Baylaw won't
let him come over anymore.

339
00:23:05.978 --> 00:23:07.279
The boy's. like. ten years old.

340
00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:09.148
- Yep.
- With asthma.

341
00:23:09.915 --> 00:23:12.151
RJ gets picked on by all
the kids in his own grade.

342
00:23:12.251 --> 00:23:15.287
so he pays that forward by
bullying anyone weaker than him.

343
00:23:15.388 --> 00:23:16.922
Freakshow.

344
00:23:17.256 --> 00:23:20.159
In other news.
so what's up with Sophia?

345
00:23:21.227 --> 00:23:22.828
I'm pregnant.

346
00:23:23.062 --> 00:23:24.764
Shut up. are you serious?

347
00:23:25.597 --> 00:23:28.200
Oh. that's wild.
do you know who's it is?

348
00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.170
Of course I know
who's it is. it's Trey's!

349
00:23:31.771 --> 00:23:33.538
- Oh.
- What?

350
00:23:34.073 --> 00:23:36.208
- Nothing.
- No. tell me. what?

351
00:23:36.308 --> 00:23:39.544
It's like I heard
he was with Fatchick now.

352
00:23:39.645 --> 00:23:41.579
No. he just gets
weed off of her.

353
00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.782
That's not what I heard.

354
00:23:42.882 --> 00:23:44.850
Can we focus
on the problem here?

355
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:47.552
- What's that?
- The baby. Malecia. the baby!

356
00:23:47.653 --> 00:23:49.955
- Oh. gee. relax.
- Relax?

357
00:23:50.056 --> 00:23:53.826
I cannot relax.
My mom is going to kill me.

358
00:23:53.926 --> 00:23:55.795
My whole life is over!

359
00:23:55.895 --> 00:23:57.663
I'm going to have
to drop out of school.

360
00:23:57.763 --> 00:24:01.100
I'm going to have to get.
like. a job for diapers.

361
00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.302
No. you won't.
that's what welfare's for.

362
00:24:03.836 --> 00:24:04.904
What?

363
00:24:05.004 --> 00:24:07.673
I'm going to get so fat!

364
00:24:07.773 --> 00:24:09.341
Well. look at the bright side.

365
00:24:09.442 --> 00:24:11.343
if Trey's into Madison Fatchek.

366
00:24:11.944 --> 00:24:14.280
maybe he likes a little
extra cushion for the pushing.

367
00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.282
Ow. sorry.

368
00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:19.118
He's not with Fatchek.

369
00:24:20.386 --> 00:24:23.122
Besides. heard she lost. like.
a lot of weight or something.

370
00:24:23.222 --> 00:24:24.990
Oh. I have an idea.

371
00:24:26.258 --> 00:24:28.360
- Well. spit it out.
- Girl. that's what you should have done.

372
00:24:29.695 --> 00:24:31.596
Ow. sorry.

373
00:24:33.032 --> 00:24:35.901
You could get an abortion.

374
00:24:37.069 --> 00:24:39.071
You mean. like. kill it?

375
00:24:39.171 --> 00:24:41.340
You can't kill something that's
not been born yet. can you?

376
00:24:42.308 --> 00:24:46.045
I mean. I guess not.
Is that even legal?

377
00:24:46.145 --> 00:24:48.881
Of course it's legal. it's been
legal since. like. the '80's.

378
00:24:49.248 --> 00:24:51.317
Haven't you ever heard
of a woman's right to choose?

379
00:24:52.184 --> 00:24:54.019
I thought it was choosing
the name or something.

380
00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:57.123
No. dummy.
that means you can choose

381
00:24:57.223 --> 00:24:59.959
to keep it or...

382
00:25:01.794 --> 00:25:03.963
- So my mom would never know?
- Nope.

383
00:25:04.063 --> 00:25:05.297
Nobody ever has to know.

384
00:25:05.998 --> 00:25:07.633
Here. let's search it.

385
00:25:09.301 --> 00:25:13.772
Ohio abortions... got it.

386
00:25:14.206 --> 00:25:16.075
Well. what's it say?

387
00:25:17.343 --> 00:25:18.244
Uh...

388
00:25:21.947 --> 00:25:25.784
A parent must consent
before a minor gets an abortion.

389
00:25:26.785 --> 00:25:28.387
My life is so over.

390
00:25:30.222 --> 00:25:31.757
Want to go get pizza?

391
00:25:32.424 --> 00:25:34.226
Go grab me another
six pack out the fridge.

392
00:25:37.997 --> 00:25:40.266
- Can I get one?
- Yeah. no.

393
00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.808
- Where you all going?
- Out.

394
00:25:49.909 --> 00:25:50.910
You got to babysit
the boys next door.

395
00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:53.412
- Uh. no one told me that.
- Yeah. the neighbor lady

396
00:25:53.512 --> 00:25:55.080
came over this morning.
asked if you could watch them

397
00:25:55.181 --> 00:25:57.116
while she do some
last minute Christmas shopping.

398
00:25:57.216 --> 00:25:59.251
- So I told her. all right.
- Well. I can't.

399
00:25:59.351 --> 00:26:01.754
Your mom going to be heated
when she find out.

400
00:26:01.854 --> 00:26:04.990
- You know we need that scrilla.
- Sorry. not sorry.

401
00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:08.761
Malecia!

402
00:26:09.962 --> 00:26:10.963
I can babysit.

403
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:13.265
You?

404
00:26:22.341 --> 00:26:24.777
- So when did it happen?
- What?

405
00:26:26.378 --> 00:26:28.047
Oh. oh!

406
00:26:28.147 --> 00:26:30.816
- Oh. yeah.
- On Thanksgiving.

407
00:26:30.916 --> 00:26:33.152
Get out. he stuffed you
up on turkey day?

408
00:26:35.888 --> 00:26:37.423
Was it at his house or yours?

409
00:26:37.523 --> 00:26:40.125
He actually got in a huge fight
with his parents that night.

410
00:26:40.793 --> 00:26:44.129
had nowhere to go to eat so
I invited him over to join us.

411
00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:45.798
Oh. you're too sweet.

412
00:26:46.198 --> 00:26:47.466
It actually happened in his car.

413
00:26:50.302 --> 00:26:53.005
<i>Next thing I knew
we were just doing it.</i>

414
00:26:53.839 --> 00:26:55.007
<i>How'd you get pregnant?</i>

415
00:26:55.107 --> 00:26:56.342
Uh. last time I checked

416
00:26:56.442 --> 00:26:58.344
there's only one way
to get pregnant.

417
00:26:58.444 --> 00:27:01.013
- Didn't he use a condom?
- Yeah. at first.

418
00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:02.481
Then it kept getting...

419
00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:07.052
- soft.
- The condom?

420
00:27:07.152 --> 00:27:08.187
No. him!

421
00:27:08.287 --> 00:27:09.388
So he had to take it off.

422
00:27:10.155 --> 00:27:11.323
Oh.

423
00:27:22.067 --> 00:27:24.370
- Sophia!
- Oh. no.

424
00:27:26.205 --> 00:27:30.209
I waited for my period.
it just never came.

425
00:27:33.912 --> 00:27:35.814
- No way!
- What!

426
00:27:36.081 --> 00:27:39.018
It's my mom. she says
someone broke into the house.

427
00:27:39.118 --> 00:27:41.487
- Really?
- Sorry. bae. got to go.

428
00:27:46.225 --> 00:27:49.395
Stay strong. girl.
you'll figure it out. Hundo p.

429
00:27:52.364 --> 00:27:54.867
Oh. hell no.
they took our presents.

430
00:28:09.315 --> 00:28:14.253
Sophia. won't you
ride with me-a?

431
00:28:14.353 --> 00:28:15.521
Are you stalking me?

432
00:28:16.188 --> 00:28:17.456
You wish I was stalking you.

433
00:28:17.556 --> 00:28:19.124
So you're not stalking me?

434
00:28:19.224 --> 00:28:20.959
No. I'm. uh.
I'm on my way to Walmart.

435
00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:22.328
- Oh. really?
- Yeah.

436
00:28:22.428 --> 00:28:24.997
- Walmart's that way.
- Oh. I mean. uh.

437
00:28:25.097 --> 00:28:26.265
I mean. I'm coming
back from Walmart.

438
00:28:26.365 --> 00:28:28.067
Oh. What'd you get?

439
00:28:28.167 --> 00:28:32.037
I. uh. I shoplifted this gum.
you want a piece?

440
00:28:32.471 --> 00:28:34.406
- You stole this?
- Maybe.

441
00:28:34.506 --> 00:28:36.342
would that turn you on?

442
00:28:37.176 --> 00:28:38.610
I mean. that's why you're
with Trey. right.

443
00:28:38.712 --> 00:28:39.945
you like criminals.

444
00:28:40.312 --> 00:28:41.180
No.

445
00:28:42.181 --> 00:28:44.049
Huh. I just figured it
probably made you wet

446
00:28:44.149 --> 00:28:45.250
every time he talks about juvie.

447
00:28:45.351 --> 00:28:47.186
Ew.

448
00:28:49.054 --> 00:28:51.323
He's 18 now. so no more juvie.

449
00:28:51.423 --> 00:28:53.158
You know that's
so statutory right?

450
00:28:53.258 --> 00:28:54.893
- Shut up!
- I'm just saying.

451
00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:00.532
- So why him?
- Why not?

452
00:29:01.133 --> 00:29:02.368
Because he's a complete tool.

453
00:29:02.468 --> 00:29:04.570
- You're a tool!
- Good one.

454
00:29:05.471 --> 00:29:06.972
Why do you think he's a tool?

455
00:29:07.506 --> 00:29:08.907
Where do I even start?

456
00:29:10.008 --> 00:29:12.544
Jimmy Stam told me his real name
is Edward Davis III.

457
00:29:12.645 --> 00:29:14.647
He just calls himself
Trey to sound black.

458
00:29:15.247 --> 00:29:18.517
He acts like he's all hood and
gangster. he's country as shit.

459
00:29:18.617 --> 00:29:21.620
His dad's
the fishing warden. real hood.

460
00:29:23.255 --> 00:29:25.290
And plus isn't he
supposed to be a senior?

461
00:29:25.391 --> 00:29:27.226
He's failed
three years in a row.

462
00:29:28.327 --> 00:29:31.430
He's a liar. he's an asshole
and he's a scumbag.

463
00:29:31.964 --> 00:29:33.532
I bet he's cheating
on you right now.

464
00:29:34.299 --> 00:29:36.435
People like him need
to be put in their place.

465
00:29:38.237 --> 00:29:41.073
Okay. psycho. let's go.

466
00:29:41.173 --> 00:29:43.342
- Where are we going?
- Madison Fatchek's house.

467
00:29:43.442 --> 00:29:46.378
- Okey dokey. pretty lady.
- You're such a dork.

468
00:30:14.473 --> 00:30:16.108
Oh. look at these losers.

469
00:30:16.208 --> 00:30:18.177
Isn't that Trey's little slut?

470
00:30:18.678 --> 00:30:20.579
Hey. watch this.

471
00:30:27.252 --> 00:30:28.153
Fags!

472
00:30:32.558 --> 00:30:33.959
Assholes.

473
00:30:34.359 --> 00:30:36.195
I think those were Trey's friends.

474
00:30:46.405 --> 00:30:48.507
- That's his whip. right?
- Yeah.

475
00:30:49.408 --> 00:30:50.643
He probably stole it.

476
00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:15.702
I told you so.

477
00:31:15.802 --> 00:31:17.069
He's just smoking some weed.

478
00:31:17.169 --> 00:31:18.270
it isn't even
that big of a deal.

479
00:31:41.794 --> 00:31:43.028
Oh. snap!

480
00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:45.030
- Busted.
- Oh.

481
00:31:46.532 --> 00:31:47.634
Seriously?

482
00:31:50.737 --> 00:31:52.170
Let's go!

483
00:31:57.175 --> 00:31:59.478
Sophia.
it's not what it looks like!

484
00:31:59.578 --> 00:32:00.813
You lied to me!

485
00:32:00.914 --> 00:32:03.081
I'm sorry. shawty.
my head's all messed up.

486
00:32:03.181 --> 00:32:04.416
I don't even know
what's going on.

487
00:32:04.516 --> 00:32:05.617
Let that bitch go. Trey.

488
00:32:05.718 --> 00:32:07.553
Who you calling a bitch. skank?

489
00:32:07.654 --> 00:32:09.756
Tell her you're with
a real woman now.

490
00:32:09.856 --> 00:32:11.156
Shut up. skank.

491
00:32:12.157 --> 00:32:13.258
Sophia.

492
00:32:13.693 --> 00:32:16.061
Okay. hoe. you gots to go.

493
00:32:16.161 --> 00:32:18.430
I'm about to pop you
like a cherry on prom night.

494
00:32:24.202 --> 00:32:25.203
Whoa!

495
00:32:31.711 --> 00:32:34.313
Damn!

496
00:32:34.413 --> 00:32:36.849
Oh.

497
00:32:38.317 --> 00:32:40.853
- Are you getting that?
- Yep.

498
00:32:42.287 --> 00:32:43.155
Oh. man.

499
00:32:58.503 --> 00:33:00.472
- All right.
- Hell yeah!

500
00:33:09.247 --> 00:33:10.783
Are you going to
help me up or what?

501
00:33:12.484 --> 00:33:13.686
Hey. give me my shirt back.

502
00:33:16.956 --> 00:33:18.323
Sophia. wait!

503
00:33:22.829 --> 00:33:24.396
What are you looking at?

504
00:33:24.496 --> 00:33:27.867
This one's going on YouTube!

505
00:33:52.324 --> 00:33:54.593
- You okay?
- No.

506
00:33:55.327 --> 00:33:57.462
Well. look.
my offer still stands.

507
00:33:57.562 --> 00:33:59.598
nothing's better for a heartache
than a horror movie.

508
00:33:59.699 --> 00:34:02.200
a bottle of 151 and some
Sprite to chase it down.

509
00:34:02.802 --> 00:34:05.437
There's actually this flick
called. <i>Silent Night. Deadly Night</i>

510
00:34:05.537 --> 00:34:07.239
- about a deranged...
- I can't.

511
00:34:07.774 --> 00:34:09.207
Well. if Santa's not your thing.

512
00:34:09.307 --> 00:34:10.810
there's always
<i>Killer Klowns from Outer Space.</i>

513
00:34:10.910 --> 00:34:12.611
No. I can't come over.

514
00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:15.648
Don't tell me
it's because of Trey.

515
00:34:15.748 --> 00:34:17.850
he's cheating on you.
you saw it with your own eyes.

516
00:34:18.785 --> 00:34:20.753
There's two types
of men in this world.

517
00:34:20.853 --> 00:34:22.287
and he's neither of them.

518
00:34:23.723 --> 00:34:28.293
You're smart. you're fun. you're
beautiful. you're perfect.

519
00:34:29.729 --> 00:34:30.663
Stop.

520
00:34:31.898 --> 00:34:32.765
What?

521
00:34:33.933 --> 00:34:34.934
I'm...

522
00:34:35.902 --> 00:34:37.637
Let me guess. you're
still in love with him?

523
00:34:38.336 --> 00:34:39.438
I give up.

524
00:34:39.906 --> 00:34:41.206
Noah.

525
00:34:42.842 --> 00:34:44.409
I'm pregnant!

526
00:34:45.645 --> 00:34:46.846
With his?

527
00:34:49.816 --> 00:34:51.651
I guess I was wrong
about you. Sophia.

528
00:34:51.751 --> 00:34:53.351
you're not
as smart as I thought.

529
00:34:54.519 --> 00:34:55.387
Good luck.

530
00:34:56.189 --> 00:34:57.757
- What?
- You're going to need it.

531
00:35:02.995 --> 00:35:04.897
He spit on us!

532
00:35:24.951 --> 00:35:26.251
What's wrong with you?

533
00:35:43.568 --> 00:35:45.403
Hey.

534
00:35:46.873 --> 00:35:48.340
You all right?

535
00:35:49.108 --> 00:35:51.476
You need to talk?

536
00:35:51.978 --> 00:35:53.478
Is this about that white boy

537
00:35:53.578 --> 00:35:55.047
that thinks of himself
as a brother?

538
00:35:55.882 --> 00:35:57.616
You just let me know.

539
00:35:57.717 --> 00:36:00.418
I've been waiting months to slap
the black out of his mouth.

540
00:36:01.654 --> 00:36:04.523
Or if it's a womanly issue.

541
00:36:05.057 --> 00:36:07.026
your mom
won't be back for awhile.

542
00:36:07.126 --> 00:36:08.795
but you can always
go to your Grandma's.

543
00:36:09.528 --> 00:36:12.531
- Just go away!
- Okay.

544
00:36:12.632 --> 00:36:15.001
I'm just trying to help. God.

545
00:36:22.108 --> 00:36:24.309
How long you going to be in there?

546
00:36:25.577 --> 00:36:27.512
I got to take a shit!

547
00:37:05.584 --> 00:37:07.619
- Get off my porch.
- Grandpa.

548
00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:11.123
- I will shoot.
- Grandpa. it's me. Sophia.

549
00:37:11.657 --> 00:37:13.693
- Who?
- Your granddaughter!

550
00:37:14.559 --> 00:37:16.762
Oh. yeah.

551
00:37:16.863 --> 00:37:19.765
- Come on in. sweetie pie.
- Okay.

552
00:37:43.923 --> 00:37:46.458
Go on. take a seat. sit down.

553
00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:49.461
What happened to your eye?

554
00:37:52.564 --> 00:37:55.400
- What's that?
- Your eye. what happened?

555
00:37:55.735 --> 00:37:58.436
That ain't nothing. I'm fine.

556
00:38:12.517 --> 00:38:14.486
I'm sorry. where are my manners.

557
00:38:14.586 --> 00:38:17.622
would you like something
to drink some milk or pop?

558
00:38:17.924 --> 00:38:19.025
No. thanks.

559
00:38:19.659 --> 00:38:21.861
- You want to cookie?
- No. I'm good.

560
00:38:21.961 --> 00:38:23.029
Well. suit yourself.

561
00:38:27.233 --> 00:38:28.134
Where's Grandma at?

562
00:38:50.156 --> 00:38:51.791
We just don't want
any trouble here. ma'am.

563
00:39:03.769 --> 00:39:06.172
- You worthless piece of garbage!
- Hey!

564
00:39:06.272 --> 00:39:09.709
- Ow!
- Settle down.

565
00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:14.180
Okay. that was against the law.

566
00:39:22.755 --> 00:39:24.790
Oh. who gives a shit.

567
00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:26.624
I was just hoping
to talk to her.

568
00:39:27.026 --> 00:39:29.494
Why. you have
a bad day at school?

569
00:39:29.962 --> 00:39:32.231
Oh. there's no school today.
it's Christmas Eve.

570
00:39:32.898 --> 00:39:34.033
Oh. yeah.

571
00:39:35.234 --> 00:39:37.569
I knew that.

572
00:39:38.871 --> 00:39:40.572
Can I ask you
a question. Grandpa?

573
00:39:41.774 --> 00:39:43.242
Shoot. kiddo.

574
00:39:43.943 --> 00:39:46.078
Why did you and Grandma
stop after Mom came along?

575
00:39:46.912 --> 00:39:49.048
Like. why didn't you guys
have any more kids?

576
00:39:56.088 --> 00:39:58.090
- We did.
- What?

577
00:39:59.591 --> 00:40:00.659
Your mama...

578
00:40:02.328 --> 00:40:04.296
she was actually
our second child.

579
00:40:05.798 --> 00:40:08.768
She's got an older sister
out there somewhere.

580
00:40:09.735 --> 00:40:10.736
What?

581
00:40:13.939 --> 00:40:14.974
You know what.

582
00:40:15.975 --> 00:40:18.144
your grandma would fry
my balls for breakfast

583
00:40:18.244 --> 00:40:21.947
if she knew I was going to tell you
this. but guess what. kiddy...

584
00:40:23.382 --> 00:40:25.651
want you get to my age
you start passing secrets

585
00:40:25.751 --> 00:40:27.619
like you pass gas.

586
00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:29.155
Oh. Grandpa.

587
00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:32.825
It's milk.

588
00:40:33.625 --> 00:40:34.827
So what happened to her?

589
00:40:37.029 --> 00:40:39.331
- Who's that?
- Mom's sister.

590
00:40:44.103 --> 00:40:45.971
You know that story about how

591
00:40:46.072 --> 00:40:47.940
me and your Grandma met.
don't you?

592
00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:50.109
Yeah. at a Cleveland Indians
game. right?

593
00:40:50.209 --> 00:40:53.813
We didn't meet
at no Indians game.

594
00:40:53.913 --> 00:40:55.981
that was just a.
just a bunch of hog wash

595
00:40:56.082 --> 00:40:57.615
your grandma told everyone.

596
00:40:58.350 --> 00:41:01.053
Christ. we. we met at a church.

597
00:41:01.153 --> 00:41:03.022
You and Grandma went to church?

598
00:41:03.122 --> 00:41:06.225
Hell yes.
we went in to church.

599
00:41:08.327 --> 00:41:11.931
That was damn near 50 years ago.

600
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:21.073
<i>You see your grandma
was real religious back then.</i>

601
00:41:22.374 --> 00:41:25.010
<i>I attended
on a regular basis. though</i>

602
00:41:25.111 --> 00:41:27.780
<i>I wasn't much
for the singing and dancing</i>

603
00:41:28.681 --> 00:41:29.782
<i>till I met her.</i>

604
00:41:30.916 --> 00:41:35.121
<i>From that moment on
there was no getting between us.</i>

605
00:41:39.825 --> 00:41:41.026
Good Lord!

606
00:41:41.127 --> 00:41:45.831
Oh. my God. oh. oh.
oh. my God. oh. oh.

607
00:41:45.931 --> 00:41:49.168
amen. oh. amen. oh. my God!

608
00:41:50.102 --> 00:41:51.804
Long story short...

609
00:41:53.439 --> 00:41:54.707
I put a bun in her over.

610
00:41:56.041 --> 00:41:59.745
And after a few months.
that baby girl was upon us.

611
00:42:02.348 --> 00:42:04.250
So we put her up for adoption.

612
00:42:05.050 --> 00:42:06.051
Why?

613
00:42:06.152 --> 00:42:08.320
Well. I didn't have a job.

614
00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:11.090
we had no way
to support her and it's...

615
00:42:13.192 --> 00:42:16.262
sometimes life only gives you
one choice in the moment.

616
00:42:18.164 --> 00:42:20.699
I always hoped that
she had a good life.

617
00:42:20.799 --> 00:42:22.868
she. she found a good family

618
00:42:22.968 --> 00:42:25.404
that loved her
and took care of her.

619
00:42:28.307 --> 00:42:30.976
Anyway. Grandma and me.
we moved on.

620
00:42:32.912 --> 00:42:36.015
After a few years.
I got a job at the mill.

621
00:42:36.415 --> 00:42:39.885
We built a house
and we started trying again.

622
00:42:40.486 --> 00:42:42.254
That's when your mama came along

623
00:42:42.354 --> 00:42:45.824
and believe me. with all the
spit and vinegar in her veins.

624
00:42:46.292 --> 00:42:48.861
one was enough.

625
00:42:48.961 --> 00:42:49.795
Wow.

626
00:42:50.396 --> 00:42:51.463
Yeah.

627
00:42:52.698 --> 00:42:56.335
Funny thing is we. we ain't
never been back to church since.

628
00:42:57.469 --> 00:43:00.239
So I bought myself
a wedding coat

629
00:43:00.339 --> 00:43:02.241
and I met her at the courthouse.

630
00:43:03.876 --> 00:43:06.011
- And that was that.
- Yeah.

631
00:43:07.046 --> 00:43:09.481
And that. sweetie pie. was that.

632
00:43:12.051 --> 00:43:15.321
Son of a bitch.
what time is it?

633
00:43:15.421 --> 00:43:17.223
Uh. it's a quarter past eight.

634
00:43:17.323 --> 00:43:19.358
Yeah. I forgot to take
my cholesterol pills.

635
00:43:23.896 --> 00:43:25.798
Are you sure I can't get
you something to eat?

636
00:43:26.198 --> 00:43:29.101
No. thanks. Grandpa. I haven't had
much of an appetite today anyway.

637
00:43:29.568 --> 00:43:30.970
Plus. I got to get going.

638
00:43:33.339 --> 00:43:34.306
Bye. Grandpa.

639
00:43:39.979 --> 00:43:41.347
Hey. tell Grandma I said hi.

640
00:43:42.047 --> 00:43:42.948
Okay.

641
00:43:43.849 --> 00:43:44.516
Bye!

642
00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.956
Yeah. Grandma.

Yep. Jesus is the one.
Jesus is the daddy.

654
00:44:40.139 --> 00:44:43.275
he knocked me up.
I'm still a virgin.

655

Your brother was being a bad
boy. but if your mommy asks.

660

he fell down when you were
playing tag. you understand?

666
00:45:35.961 --> 00:45:39.031
Have you even got my texts. I've been
blowing up the phone like a hella cray.

667
00:45:39.598 --> 00:45:41.233
I don't know what
I was thinking.

668
00:45:41.333 --> 00:45:44.103
Maybe I thought. you know.
you're on a break. or something.

669
00:45:44.203 --> 00:45:46.138

670

in your hands. you feel me?

671
00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:50.409
- Trey. I have something to tell you.
- Whoa. whoa. whoa. wait.

672

Let me finish. let me finish.

673
00:45:52.679 --> 00:45:54.580
I know I made a mistake.

674
00:45:54.681 --> 00:45:58.016
but the truth is that hoe
ain't got nothing on you. girl.

675
00:45:59.686 --> 00:46:01.286

00:46:05.257 --> 00:46:06.258
I love everything...

679
00:46:07.292 --> 00:46:09.328
Wait. what?

680
00:46:09.428 --> 00:46:10.630
You heard me.

681
00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:11.530
That shit ain't mine.

682
00:46:12.398 --> 00:46:13.899
I know that shit
for reals ain't mine.

683
00:46:13.999 --> 00:46:16.235
- Who's do you think it is?
- I don't know.

684
00:46:16.335 --> 00:46:18.103
maybe it's that one kid
you've been hanging with.

685
00:46:18.203 --> 00:46:19.571
What's his name. Noah Vanhomo?

686
00:46:19.672 --> 00:46:21.540
- No.
- I see the way he look at you.

687
00:46:22.274 --> 00:46:23.375
- He hit that. huh?
- No.

688
00:46:23.475 --> 00:46:25.010
- I know he hit that.
- Trey.

689
00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:26.545
You're the only person

690
00:46:26.646 --> 00:46:27.647
I've ever been with.

691
00:46:28.782 --> 00:46:31.216
You expect me to believe that?
