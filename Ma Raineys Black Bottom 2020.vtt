<i>Everybody got it.</i>

195

<i>Everybody can't play like I do.</i>

196
00:11:23.083 --> 00:11:24.916
<i>Everybody can't have their own band.</i>

197
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.375
<i>Until you get your own band</i>
<i>where you can play what you want.</i>

<i>I could look at y'all</i>
<i>and see what kind of band it is.</i>

203
00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:41.375
<i>I could look at Toledo</i>

204
00:11:41.458 --> 00:11:44.833
<i>Oh. now Toledo ain't said nothing to you.</i>

<i>rehearse the music or ain't you?</i>

206

<i>Oh. come on. Levee.</i>
<i>We was all just having fun.</i>

716
00:35:24.916 --> 00:35:27.125

<i>He don't need nobody messing with him</i>

721
00:35:35.875 --> 00:35:39.000
<i>'Cause you don't know nothing about me.</i>
<i>You don't know Levee.</i>

722

<i>You don't know nothing</i>
<i>about what kind of blood I got!</i>

723
00:35:41.416 --> 00:35:43.375
<i>What kind of a heart I got beating here!</i>

724
00:35:46.125 --> 00:35:47.708
<i>I was eight years old</i>

725
00:35:48.291 --> 00:35:50.708
<i>when a gang of white mans</i>
<i>come into my daddy's house</i>

726
00:35:50.791 --> 00:35:53.208
<i>and have to do with my mama</i>
<i>any way they want.</i>

727
00:35:54.708 --> 00:35:59.291
<i>We was living in Jefferson County.</i>
<i>about eight miles outside of Natchez.</i>

728
00:35:59.375 --> 00:36:02.666
<i>My daddy's name was Memphis.</i>
<i>Memphis Lee Green.</i>

729
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:07.041
<i>Had him near 50 acres of good</i>
<i>farming land. I'm talking good land.</i>

730
00:36:07.125 --> 00:36:08.708
<i>Grow anything you want.</i>

731
00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.500
<i>He done gone off of shares</i>
<i>and bought this land</i>

732
00:36:11.583 --> 00:36:14.125
<i>from Mr. Hallie's widow woman</i>
<i>after he done passed on.</i>

733
00:36:14.208 --> 00:36:17.166
<i>Folks called him a uppity nigger</i>
<i>'cause he done saved and borrowed</i>

734
00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:19.875
<i>to where he could</i>
<i>buy this land and be independent.</i>

735
00:36:21.125 --> 00:36:22.833
<i>It was coming on planting time.</i>

736
00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:26.916
<i>and my daddy went into Natchez</i>
<i>to get him some seed and fertilizer.</i>

737
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.500
<i>Called me. say. "Levee.</i>
<i>you the man of the house now."</i>

738
00:36:33.333 --> 00:36:35.458
<i>"Take care of your mama while I'm gone."</i>

739
00:36:38.416 --> 00:36:39.958
<i>I wasn't but a little boy.</i>

740
00:36:41.541 --> 00:36:42.875
<i>Eight years old.</i>

741
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.083
<i>My mama…</i>

742
00:36:48.291 --> 00:36:51.416
<i>was frying up some chicken</i>
<i>when them mans come in the house.</i>

743
00:36:52.333 --> 00:36:54.125
<i>Must have been eight or nine of 'em.</i>

744
00:36:55.458 --> 00:36:59.875
<i>She's standing there frying that chicken</i>
<i>when them mans come and took a hold of her</i>

745
00:36:59.958 --> 00:37:04.541
<i>just like you take hold of a mule</i>
<i>and make it do what you want.</i>

746
00:37:08.541 --> 00:37:10.041
<i>There was my mama…</i>

747
00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:13.208
<i>with a gang of white mans.</i>

748
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:19.666
<i>She tried to fight 'em off.</i>

749
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.750
<i>I could see where </i>
<i>it wasn't gonna do her any good.</i>

750
00:37:25.041 --> 00:37:27.125
<i>I didn't know what they was doing to her.</i>

751
00:37:27.208 --> 00:37:30.541
<i>but I figured whatever it was.</i>
<i>they might as well do to me too.</i>

752
00:37:32.666 --> 00:37:36.625
<i>My daddy had a knife he kept around there</i>
<i>for hunting and working and whatnot.</i>

753
00:37:36.708 --> 00:37:39.708
<i>And I knew where he kept it.</i>
<i>I went and got it.</i>

754
00:37:42.125 --> 00:37:47.125
<i>I'm gonna show you</i>
<i>how spooked up I was by the white man.</i>

755
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.875
<i>I tried my damnedest</i>
<i>to cut one of them's throat.</i>

756
00:37:53.208 --> 00:37:54.750
<i>I hit him on the shoulder.</i>

757
00:37:55.875 --> 00:37:57.541
<i>He reached back.</i>
<i>grabbed hold of that knife.</i>

758
00:37:57.625 --> 00:38:00.041
<i>and whacked me across the chest with it.</i>

759
00:38:03.916 --> 00:38:05.000
<i>[sniffles]</i>

760
00:38:05.833 --> 00:38:07.416
<i>That's what made them stop.</i>

761
00:38:08.833 --> 00:38:11.041
<i>They was scared</i>
<i>I was gonna bleed to death.</i>

762
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.791
<i>My mama wrapped me in a blanket.</i>

763
00:38:14.875 --> 00:38:18.000
<i>carried me two miles</i>
<i>down to the Furlow place</i>

764
00:38:18.083 --> 00:38:20.333
<i>and they drove me up to Doc Albans.</i>

765
00:38:20.416 --> 00:38:23.958
<i>He was waiting on a calf to be born.</i>
<i>and he say he ain't had time to see me.</i>

766
00:38:25.125 --> 00:38:27.375
<i>They carried me to Miss Etta. the midwife.</i>

767
00:38:28.541 --> 00:38:30.000
<i>and she fixed me up.</i>

768
00:38:32.333 --> 00:38:33.791
<i>My daddy came back</i>

769
00:38:34.791 --> 00:38:37.708
<i>and acted like he done accepted</i>
<i>the facts of what happened.</i>

770
00:38:38.208 --> 00:38:40.583
<i>He got the names</i>
<i>of them mans from Mama.</i>

771
00:38:41.708 --> 00:38:43.000
<i>He found out who they was.</i>

772
00:38:43.083 --> 00:38:45.333
<i>and then we announced</i>
<i>we was moving out that county.</i>

773
00:38:45.416 --> 00:38:47.916
<i>We said goodbye to everybody.</i>
<i>all the neighbors.</i>

774
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.291
<i>[breathes deeply]</i>

775
00:38:50.375 --> 00:38:53.375
<i>My daddy went and smiled</i>
<i>in the face of one of them crackers</i>

776
00:38:53.458 --> 00:38:54.916
<i>who had been with my mama.</i>

777
00:38:57.125 --> 00:38:58.708
<i>Smiled in his face…</i>

778
00:38:59.958 --> 00:39:01.625
<i>and sold him our land.</i>

779
00:39:03.833 --> 00:39:06.500
<i>We moved over with relations in Caldwell.</i>

780
00:39:07.208 --> 00:39:09.000
<i>He got us settled in.</i>

781

<i>got to tend with the consequences.</i>

1183
01:02:11.166 --> 01:02:14.541
<i>That's the best sense you made all day.</i>

1184
01:02:14.625 --> 01:02:17.833
<i>That's the only sensible thing</i>
<i>you said today. admitting you was a fool.</i>

1185
01:02:17.916 --> 01:02:21.375
<i>Oh. I admits it. all right.</i>
<i>Ain't nothing wrong with it.</i>

<i>Gonna be a bit more things</i>
<i>before I'm finished with it.</i>

1188
01:02:27.250 --> 01:02:29.375
<i>But I ain't never been</i>
<i>the same fool twice.</i>

1189
01:02:29.458 --> 01:02:30.791
<i>That's where we part ways.</i>

1190
01:02:30.875 --> 01:02:33.208
<i>But you been a fool. That's what counts.</i>

1191
01:02:33.291 --> 01:02:35.416
<i>Talking about I'm a fool</i>
<i>for asking the girl her name.</i>

1192
01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:37.125
<i>and here you is one yourself.</i>

1193
01:02:37.208 --> 01:02:39.000
<i>I married a woman. A good woman.</i>

1194
01:02:39.083 --> 01:02:42.125
<i>To this day.</i>
<i>I can't say nothing bad about this woman.</i>

1195
01:02:42.208 --> 01:02:45.583
<i>I married her with all the good intentions</i>
<i>and graces of being hooked up.</i>

1196
01:02:45.666 --> 01:02:47.875
<i>bound to her for the rest of my life.</i>

1197
01:02:47.958 --> 01:02:49.833
<i>Looking for this woman</i>
<i>to put me in my grave.</i>

1198
01:02:50.416 --> 01:02:52.666
<i>but she went out and joined the church.</i>

1199
01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.625
<i>She got up there</i>
<i>and got to seeing them good Christian men</i>

1200
01:02:58.708 --> 01:03:00.791
<i>and wondering why I ain't like that.</i>

1201
01:03:01.375 --> 01:03:04.125
<i>Soon she figured</i>
<i>she hooked up to a heathen.</i>

1202
01:03:04.208 --> 01:03:05.500
<i>Couldn't live like that.</i>

1203
01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:07.750
<i>So she left.</i>

1204
01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:09.625
<i>Hmm.</i>

1205
01:03:09.708 --> 01:03:14.416
<i>I just sat down and I figured I was a fool</i>

1206
01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:18.000
<i>not to see that she needed</i>
<i>something that I wasn't giving her.</i>

1207
01:03:18.083 --> 01:03:20.416
<i>else she wouldn't have been</i>
<i>up there at the church.</i>

1208
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:21.958
<i>So. yeah…</i>

1209
01:03:22.833 --> 01:03:25.041
<i>Toledo been a fool about a woman.</i>

1210
01:03:26.416 --> 01:03:27.791
<i>That's part of making life.</i>

1211
01:03:28.958 --> 01:03:31.041
<i>Toledo. what you call a fool</i>

1212
01:03:31.125 --> 01:03:33.416
<i>and what I call a fool</i>
<i>are two different things.</i>

1213
01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:37.666
<i>A fool is responsible</i>
<i>for what happen to him.</i>

1214
01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:40.291
<i>A fool cause it to happen. Like Levee.</i>

1215
01:03:40.791 --> 01:03:44.583
<i>He keep messing around with Ma's gal.</i>
<i>his feet be out there scraping the ground.</i>

1216
01:03:44.666 --> 01:03:46.750
<i>-That's a fool.</i>
<i>-Nothing gonna happen to Levee.</i>

1217
01:03:46.833 --> 01:03:48.416
<i>Levee ain't gonna let</i>
<i>nothing happen to him.</i>

1218
01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:51.375
<i>Better not let Ma see you ask her.</i>
<i>That's what the man's trying to tell you.</i>

1219
01:03:51.458 --> 01:03:53.208
<i>I don't need nobody to tell me nothing.</i>

1220
01:03:53.291 --> 01:03:55.958
<i>Toledo. all I'm saying is.</i>
<i>from the looks of it.</i>

1221
01:03:56.041 --> 01:03:58.375
<i>from your story.</i>
<i>I don't think life treated you fair.</i>

1222
01:03:58.458 --> 01:03:59.750
<i>Oh. life's fair.</i>

1223
01:03:59.833 --> 01:04:00.958
<i>Life ain't shit.</i>

1224
01:04:01.041 --> 01:04:03.208
<i>You can put it in a paper bag</i>
<i>and carry it around with you.</i>

1225
01:04:03.291 --> 01:04:05.500
<i>-It ain't got no balls.</i>
<i>-[door clangs]</i>

1226
01:04:05.583 --> 01:04:08.333
<i>Now death? Death got some style.</i>

1227
01:04:08.416 --> 01:04:11.000
<i>Death will kick your ass</i>
<i>and make you wish you never been born.</i>

1228
01:04:11.083 --> 01:04:12.500
<i>That's how bad death is.</i>

1229
01:04:12.583 --> 01:04:14.791
<i>But you can rule over life.</i>
<i>Life ain't nothing.</i>

1230
01:04:14.875 --> 01:04:17.625
<i>Nigga talking about life is fair</i>
<i>and ain't got a pot to piss in.</i>

<i>to figure out what he gonna do.</i>

1283
01:06:39.250 --> 01:06:40.750
<i>when he noticed a couple of white fellas</i>

1284
01:06:40.833 --> 01:06:42.875

<i>Then two or three more fellas</i>
<i>come up and join the other one.</i>

1287
01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:53.250
<i>Now he look around the station.</i>
<i>He don't see no colored folks nowhere.</i>

<i>The people in the big city?</i>
<i>They want something with some fire to it.</i>

<i>Like I say. they're not</i>
<i>the kind of songs we're looking for.</i>

1515
01:20:18.833 --> 01:20:21.250
<i>Mr. Sturdyvant.</i>
<i>you asked me to write them songs.</i>

<i>You told me you was</i>
<i>gonna let me record them.</i>

<i>When I heard them. they didn't sound</i>
<i>like the kind I'm looking for right now.</i>

<i>You got to hear me play them.</i>

1524

<i>you had playing them songs.</i>

1530
