[peaceful music playing]

4
00:00:17.916 --> 00:00:19.458
[woman] I often think…

5
00:00:20.458 --> 00:00:22.375
marriage is like the ocean.

6
00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:26.375
At its best.

7
00:00:26.458 --> 00:00:28.750
it's the most glorious thing in the world.

8
00:00:30.875 --> 00:00:32.541
Deep with desire…

9
00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.000
majestic…

10
00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.125
yet gentle.

11
00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:43.291
Just pure magic.

12
00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:46.958
But when it's like…

00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:48.208
[upbeat music playing]

00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.666
[man singing Hindi]

15
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:05.875
[woman] Marriage is hectic.
Like one lucky packet it is.

16
00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.833
You don't know what you're gonna get.

17
00:01:07.916 --> 00:01:09.083
What do you think?

18
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:10.625
About?

19
00:01:10.708 --> 00:01:11.916
My hair.

20
00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.041
Oh… okay.

21
00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:15.958
Mm-hmm…

22
00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:17.500
How much you paid for it?

23
00:01:17.583 --> 00:01:18.916
Eight hundred.

24
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.291
[chuckles]

25
00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:21.625
They ripped you off. huh?

26
00:01:22.208 --> 00:01:23.708
You should try my barber.

27
00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:26.916
[woman] Marriage can also
be like one big tsunami.

28
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.250
That wave will come from nowhere.
You don't know what hit you. man.

29
00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:34.583
Shanti. so short you cut my fingernails.

30
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.041
Ah. she made a top breakfast.

31
00:01:37.916 --> 00:01:39.083
Yeah. She don't mind.

32
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:42.208
[woman] Yeah.
marriage can be like a cup of tea.

33
00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:43.708
Shanti. organize me a cup of tea.

34
00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:46.916
[woman]
Sometimes strong or sometimes weak.

35
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.375
And you ask yourself.
"Hey. what happened here?"

36
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.125
What are you doing?
Giving those ribbons a perm?

37
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.125
You know. I can't wait for the day
that I become a proud Aya.

38
00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:08.791
Hey. there's only one Aya in this town.

39
00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.541
and she is not dead yet.

40
00:02:14.541 --> 00:02:16.000
You know. they'll be here soon.

41
00:02:16.083 --> 00:02:18.250
[Aya] Can I help you all?

42
00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:22.083
No. you just sit there
and help Desan blow those balloons.

43
00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:26.041
I'm on my last few breaths.
and you want I must blow balloons.

44
00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:27.291
Very untidy. Shanti.

45
00:02:27.375 --> 00:02:28.333
No. it isn't.

46
00:02:28.416 --> 00:02:29.916
-Very untidy.
-No. it isn't.

47
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.750
Look at this. You do it.

48
00:02:33.208 --> 00:02:35.625
Hey. did you look at the list
of baby names from our moms?

49
00:02:35.708 --> 00:02:37.583
Agh… [chuckles]

50
00:02:38.416 --> 00:02:40.208
-So Jennifer and Shanti.
-[chuckles]

51
00:02:41.375 --> 00:02:44.291
When we are gonna be parents.
we are doing things our way.

52
00:02:45.833 --> 00:02:47.875
You got new shoes bro. huh?

53
00:02:48.791 --> 00:02:51.125
Huh… wanna get a good look. Brazzo.

54
00:02:51.208 --> 00:02:53.500
-[laughing]
-Oh gosh!

55
00:02:53.583 --> 00:02:56.166
[scoffs] "Wanna take a good look. Brazzo?"

56
00:02:57.791 --> 00:03:01.958
As for Preggie. I don't know whether
he's calling "Shanti" or "I want tea".

57
00:03:02.458 --> 00:03:03.958
He… [sighs]

58
00:03:04.041 --> 00:03:05.125
You're stressed?

59
00:03:06.125 --> 00:03:07.458
No. I didn't eat this morning.

60
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:11.458
Hmm. way to go. Shanti.
Intermittent fasting.

61
00:03:11.541 --> 00:03:14.666
Where I got time for
'intermission' fasting and all this thing

62
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.875
when Preggie keeps inviting people home?

63
00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.083
No. Again?

64
00:03:19.916 --> 00:03:20.875
Preggie is an ass.

65
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.583
[Shanti] If he is happy. then I am happy.

66
00:03:25.208 --> 00:03:26.041
I think.

67
00:03:27.416 --> 00:03:28.375
Okay. I don't know.

68
00:03:28.916 --> 00:03:31.166
-Listen. we have a plan. remember?
-Hmm.

69
00:03:31.666 --> 00:03:33.041
It's your 50th birthday.

70
00:03:33.708 --> 00:03:35.750
It's a couples-only holiday.

71
00:03:36.333 --> 00:03:39.958
This is the holiday
when we get our husbands back.

72
00:03:40.041 --> 00:03:42.625
-Yeah.
-[Elvis] Brazzo. this is the holiday

73
00:03:42.708 --> 00:03:44.375
where we dodge the wives. huh?

74
00:03:44.458 --> 00:03:45.791
[laughing]

75
00:03:47.541 --> 00:03:50.125
[gasps] Guys. they are here.
Preggie. Elvis. come!

76
00:03:50.208 --> 00:03:52.666
-Aya. come on. Let's go.
-Mama. come on. Come on.

77
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.000
[honking]

78
00:04:00.541 --> 00:04:01.541
Come on.

79
00:04:01.625 --> 00:04:02.833
[upbeat music playing]

80
00:05:07.791 --> 00:05:09.833
Come here.
You're gonna drop her. Oh.

81
00:05:10.416 --> 00:05:12.541
I don't even know
how these two managed to make a baby.

82
00:05:12.625 --> 00:05:14.666
and they haven't even said
a word to each other.

83
00:05:15.166 --> 00:05:16.958
You don't need to talk for that.

84
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.916
[gasps] Oh man!
Look at how cute they look.

85
00:05:21.416 --> 00:05:22.750
Pregnancy looks good on her.

86
00:05:24.666 --> 00:05:26.958
Nice to see you
suddenly so observant. Elvis.

87
00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:27.875
Huh?

88
00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:29.666
Hey. what happened?

89
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.625
Menopause.

90
00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:35.541
I think Jodi and Prishen
will have a baby soon.

91
00:05:35.625 --> 00:05:37.541
Yeah. hopefully.

92
00:05:37.625 --> 00:05:41.416
It will be the best 50th present ever.

93
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.000
-I know.
-Shanti. Shanti.

94
00:05:44.875 --> 00:05:45.875
I'll have some tea.

95
00:05:47.166 --> 00:05:48.208
Make for Elvis too.

96
00:05:48.916 --> 00:05:50.666
Just wait a minute.

97
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.666
-It's contagious. bro.
-Hmm.

98
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.125
Half teaspoon sugar
and extra milk for me and boil the milk.

99
00:05:57.041 --> 00:05:59.041
Where are we gonna leave Aya
when we go on this trip?

100
00:05:59.125 --> 00:06:02.083
I wanna come too.
I don't want to go stay by my connections.

101
00:06:02.166 --> 00:06:05.166
You can stay at Shanti's house
with Arsevan and Poobasha.

102
00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.166
See. Elvis? She want I must die.

103
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.875
Ma. please. If that's what I wanted.
you would be long gone.

104
00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.041
-[Elvis] Now.
-[Jennifer] She started it.

105
00:06:13.125 --> 00:06:15.625
You all must read in the paper
for my funeral message.

106
00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:18.750
Classifications. Page number two.

107
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.958
Mother of Elvis Kandasamy. 80 something.

108
00:06:23.708 --> 00:06:27.125
heart of gold. gone too soon.

109
00:06:27.791 --> 00:06:30.916
She ran out of luck
but was not out for a duck.

110
00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:33.958
Why I must bloody boil the milk…

111
00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:35.750
Boil it on her damn head.

112
00:06:37.458 --> 00:06:38.625
[shutter clicking]

113
00:06:39.916 --> 00:06:41.166
[phone ringing]

114
00:06:45.166 --> 00:06:47.458
Hey. She takes a bit long to answer.

115
00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:48.416
[chuckles]

116
00:06:49.083 --> 00:06:51.750
Fifty bucks they'll ask
when we're gonna have a baby.

117
00:06:51.833 --> 00:06:53.833
-Oh. you're on.
-[laughs]

118
00:06:53.916 --> 00:06:55.083
Come quick. Quick.

119
00:06:55.541 --> 00:06:56.375
Hey.

120
00:06:56.458 --> 00:06:57.833
I'm warning the two of you.

121
00:06:57.916 --> 00:07:00.166
No asking them about
having children and all that.

122
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.208
-Yeah. every time you say the same thing.
-There they are.

123
00:07:03.291 --> 00:07:04.708
-Hi!
-Hello.

124
00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:05.625
Hi. everyone.

125
00:07:05.708 --> 00:07:07.458
We were just talking about you all.

126
00:07:07.541 --> 00:07:08.875
How was the baby shower?

127
00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:13.500
So lovely.
Jodi. your face is looking so. uh. full.

128
00:07:13.583 --> 00:07:14.416
Shh.

129
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.916
What? I didn't say anything.

130
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.166
-[Aya] Let me say hello.
-Hey. Aya.

131
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.375
You hold it in front.

132
00:07:19.458 --> 00:07:20.833
-There you are.
-Hello.

133
00:07:20.916 --> 00:07:24.500
Tell me something. when I'm going
to become a great grandmother?

134
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.958
[Jennifer] Don't. Really. Give me that.

135
00:07:27.041 --> 00:07:28.750
[Aya] You didn't tell me I mustn't say it.

136
00:07:28.833 --> 00:07:31.708
Elvis told all of us not to say anything.
and you had to go blurt it out.

137
00:07:31.791 --> 00:07:35.291
Hey. I can't hold anything in.
Just like I can't hold a fart at my age.

138
00:07:35.375 --> 00:07:37.333
Shut up. They're still on the line.

139
00:07:37.416 --> 00:07:39.041
Ma. we've got some good news.

140
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.625
-Oh my God. It's happening.
-Your birthday wish is coming true.

141
00:07:43.708 --> 00:07:44.583
I just knew it.

142
00:07:44.666 --> 00:07:46.208
Guys. calm down first.

143
00:07:46.291 --> 00:07:48.875
We are calm. absolutely calm.

144
00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.250
My second name is Calm-la.

145
00:07:51.333 --> 00:07:52.333
[chuckles]

146
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.708
We're coming home for Diwali.

147
00:07:58.125 --> 00:08:00.625
Wow. Wow. that… that is so nice.

148
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:02.333
It's fantastic.

149
00:08:02.416 --> 00:08:04.416
Well. Jodi and I discussed it. and…

150
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.500
Well. we're sorry
about missing your birthday. Ma.

151
00:08:06.583 --> 00:08:09.875
Hey. the two of you.
you all do a lot of discussing. huh?

152
00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:10.916
Marriage 101. guys.

153
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.375
-Communication is key.
-[chuckles]

154
00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.458
Tell me something. Prishen.

155
00:08:15.541 --> 00:08:17.500
How I am gonna be a great grandmother

156
00:08:17.583 --> 00:08:20.250
if you don't put your key…
You know what I mean. eh?

157
00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:22.625
Oh my God. Ma. Really. really?

158
00:08:22.708 --> 00:08:24.166
Okay. we're gonna get going.

159
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:26.625
-but we'll see you guys soon.
-[all] Bye.

160
00:08:26.708 --> 00:08:28.958
-Love you. Bye.
-Bye.

161
00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:30.791
Wow.

162
00:08:30.875 --> 00:08:33.958
Really Ma. I mean. you're so raw.

163
00:08:34.041 --> 00:08:37.000
I mean. there's no other word
to describe it. It's just raw.

164
00:08:39.666 --> 00:08:42.416
[Shanti] I just packed easy things
so the guys can cook for us.

165
00:08:43.125 --> 00:08:44.875
Do you know
Preggie has never cooked for me?

166
00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.166
[Jennifer] Hmm.
so how does it make you feel?

167
00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:49.250
The idea of him cooking for you.

168
00:08:49.333 --> 00:08:53.583
[clicks tongue] Okay. so my ears get hot.

169
00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:55.083
[chuckles]

170
00:08:55.166 --> 00:08:56.500
And I get so shy.

171
00:08:56.583 --> 00:09:00.208
Oh my God. you just said he turns you on.
Turns you on. right?

172
00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:02.583
Hmm…

173
00:09:03.375 --> 00:09:05.541
Shanti is getting turned on.

174
00:09:05.625 --> 00:09:08.416
Shut up. man. Jen.
Anyway. what naughty things you got?

175
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.833

00:17:54.083 --> 00:17:56.833
-So. Elvis. this place is yours. right?
-Yeah.

354
00:17:57.416 --> 00:17:58.333
It's ours.

355
00:17:59.833 --> 00:18:00.666
It's ours.

356
00:18:01.375 --> 00:18:03.333
Tall and you know how to rev an engine.

357
00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:05.625
Seriously. Jen. I am jealous.

358
00:18:15.791 --> 00:18:18.875
[scoffs] Okay. Anybody is hungry?

359
00:18:19.458 --> 00:18:20.416
We all are.

360
00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:22.750
Listen to me nicely. all right?

361
00:18:22.833 --> 00:18:25.916
This is so ridiculous.
I don't know what to say.

362
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.125
[Aya] If the gulgulas are not round.

363
00:18:28.208 --> 00:18:31.416
then the gulab jamun
will always face to the ground.

364
00:18:32.166 --> 00:18:33.250
[laughing]

365
00:18:33.333 --> 00:18:34.166
Ma.

366
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.291
[Jennifer] Did you see Preggie?
Smiling like a Cheshire cat. and Elvis…

367
00:18:40.125 --> 00:18:40.958
She's just…

368
00:18:41.041 --> 00:18:44.375
Shanti. how's the tea coming?

369
00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:46.708
What happened? The kettle's not working?

370
00:18:46.791 --> 00:18:48.500
I'd like to club these two.

371
00:18:49.208 --> 00:18:50.541
[clatters]

372
00:18:50.625 --> 00:18:51.833
Thank you.

373
00:18:53.083 --> 00:18:56.750
Okay. everyone.
We have done the room allocations.

374
00:18:57.333 --> 00:19:00.166
So Shanti and Preggie.
you will have the main suite.

375
00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:02.375
Elvis and I will be down the hall.

376
00:19:02.458 --> 00:19:06.041
And Jodi and Prishen.
you will be in the room next to us.

377
00:19:06.125 --> 00:19:07.583
That leaves the last bedroom

378
00:19:07.666 --> 00:19:09.958
for Aya and Baby.

379
00:19:10.458 --> 00:19:11.583
Put it there. partner.

380
00:19:13.041 --> 00:19:16.875
Look. she's getting over a breakup.
and she'll require a bit of privacy. eh?

381
00:19:17.708 --> 00:19:19.458
Then I also want my own room.

382
00:19:19.541 --> 00:19:20.791
Ma. please. just shut it.

383
00:19:20.875 --> 00:19:24.250
Hey. I just don't want anybody
to wake up next to my dead body. huh?

384
00:19:24.333 --> 00:19:27.458
Come on. Jen. Organize something for Baby.

385
00:19:29.416 --> 00:19:33.583
Okay. le-- let's try this.
Baby. um. you get your own room.

386
00:19:33.666 --> 00:19:37.291
Um. Jodi. you and Aya can share room.

387
00:19:37.875 --> 00:19:41.833
And Prishen. you can shack it up
with Desan on the couch.

388
00:19:42.583 --> 00:19:43.416
Sorted?

389
00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:46.166
Dad. Jodi and I were looking forward
to having our own room.

390
00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:48.666
Son. your Auntie came
all the way from China.

391
00:19:49.291 --> 00:19:50.500
Yeah. but Dad. come on…

392
00:19:50.583 --> 00:19:53.375
Hey. you can rough it up
for a few days. right? Come on.

393
00:19:53.458 --> 00:19:57.625
Wait till you try Baby's chow. Her cooking
will give that one a run for her money.

394
00:19:58.708 --> 00:19:59.708
That one?

395
00:19:59.791 --> 00:20:02.875
Yeah. you. Because not this one.

396
00:20:02.958 --> 00:20:04.125
[chuckles]

397
00:20:04.208 --> 00:20:05.083
Elvis.

398
00:20:05.875 --> 00:20:08.083
Shall I tell them.
or do you wanna tell them?

399
00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:10.166
-You tell them.
-Okay.

400
00:20:11.375 --> 00:20:12.666
I am moving in with you. guys.

401
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:16.708
-Yeah. we know. One week.
-Yeah. we know. for one week.

402
00:20:16.791 --> 00:20:18.791
No. man. For good.

403
00:20:19.375 --> 00:20:21.583
Forever. In Chatsworth.

404
00:20:21.666 --> 00:20:23.291
[uneasy music playing]

405
00:20:34.208 --> 00:20:36.583
[screaming]

406
00:20:36.666 --> 00:20:40.500
Okay. okay. okay. Keep calm and breathe.
Shanti. just breathe. Breathe.

407
00:20:40.583 --> 00:20:43.416
She's gonna be staying
in my house forever. Jen. forever.

408
00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.750
Yeah. but why don't you
speak up for yourself?

409
00:20:45.833 --> 00:20:48.416
-Because he looks so happy about it.
-But that's your problem.

410
00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.583
You are always thinking
of everybody else. never about yourself.

411
00:20:52.083 --> 00:20:55.750
What about you? Why can't you tell Elvis
that he makes you feel invisible?

412
00:20:55.833 --> 00:20:57.541
Are you crazy? I can't do that.

413
00:20:57.625 --> 00:20:59.750
I don't want him to think that I am needy.

414
00:20:59.833 --> 00:21:02.208
But it's okay for him
to be running after Baby?

415
00:21:02.791 --> 00:21:04.083
But it's your sister-in-law.

416
00:21:04.666 --> 00:21:06.041
Oh. so now it's my fault?

417
00:21:06.125 --> 00:21:10.583
Exactly. Why don't you tell your family
members to stay away from my husband?

418
00:21:11.125 --> 00:21:12.333
What are you gonna do about it?

419
00:21:14.875 --> 00:21:15.833
What did you say?

420
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:19.208
I said. "What are you gonna do about it?"

421
00:21:19.291 --> 00:21:23.166
Really? Why don't you come closer
and say that to my face?

422
00:21:23.791 --> 00:21:25.291
Come on. Come on.

423
00:21:25.916 --> 00:21:27.125
Come on.

424
00:21:27.958 --> 00:21:28.833
Hey.

425
00:21:29.375 --> 00:21:30.208
Hey!

[Shanti] I can't see anything!

434
00:21:53.208 --> 00:21:54.750
Let me go!

435
00:21:54.833 --> 00:21:57.500
[Jennifer] This is it. This is it.

436

439
00:22:05.583 --> 00:22:06.791
Forever. Shanti.

440
00:22:08.416 --> 00:22:11.541
She's gonna be throwing herself
at my husband forever.

441
00:22:11.625 --> 00:22:12.541
[exhales]

442
00:22:12.625 --> 00:22:15.500
What about me? She's gonna be in my house.

443
00:22:15.583 --> 00:22:18.250
She gonna take over.
and Preggie's just gonna let her.

444
00:22:22.083 --> 00:22:23.125
Baby must go.

445
00:22:24.416 --> 00:22:25.250
Yeah.

446
00:22:26.333 --> 00:22:27.208
Yeah.

447
00:22:28.041 --> 00:22:30.541
Let's bounce this Baby
before it's too late.

448
00:22:30.625 --> 00:22:32.875
Whatever it takes. let's do this.

449
00:22:32.958 --> 00:22:34.958
[upbeat music playing]

450
00:23:01.833 --> 00:23:04.041
Oh. my sister…

451
00:23:04.125 --> 00:23:05.875
-Whoa.
-Yeah.

452
00:23:05.958 --> 00:23:07.833

Oh!

454
00:23:09.166 --> 00:23:10.958
[Prishen] Okay. last one.
That's the last one.

455
00:23:11.041 --> 00:23:13.625
-Aya. come on. Aya.
-Come on. Aya.

456
00:23:13.708 --> 00:23:16.208
-Your turn now. Come on.
-[Aya] No. no. no.

457
00:23:16.291 --> 00:23:17.875
Can you catch nuts with your mouth?

458
00:23:18.458 --> 00:23:20.875
No. but you look like a pro.

459
00:23:21.458 --> 00:23:23.708
Come on.
Time for our beach walk. Remember?

460
00:23:23.791 --> 00:23:25.375
[Preggie] We got a better idea.

461
00:23:25.458 --> 00:23:28.250
Thirty seconds.
And look. it's Baby's favorite.

462

Oh. my poor baby.

Ma. it's so early. Please wake him up.

Yeah. but it's not easy.
Sleeps like a log. man.

478
00:24:47.458 --> 00:24:51.500
Um… so Baby.
what brings you back to South Africa?

479
00:24:52.541 --> 00:24:54.833
Uh. well. I just missed my family.

Mm-hmm.

481
00:24:56.541 --> 00:24:59.833
But true. after 12 years.
you're only missing them now?

482

To be honest. I. uh…

I went through
a rough period in China and…

484

Hey. you don't have to explain anything.

[grunts]

527
00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:54.458
Jodi…

528
00:26:56.083 --> 00:26:57.000
are you there?

529
00:26:59.208 --> 00:27:00.250
Yes. Aya.

530
00:27:01.833 --> 00:27:04.708
Come. hold me like I used
to hold you when you were small.

531
00:27:18.708 --> 00:27:20.083
[chuckles quietly]

532
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:22.958
How your team lost? [laughs]

533
00:27:23.041 --> 00:27:23.875
Did you come here to…

534
00:27:23.958 --> 00:27:27.250
-Loser. loser. You lost.
-I'm not a loser.

-[sighs] Elvis. finally.
-Uh-hmm.

537
00:27:33.458 --> 00:27:35.041
Some alone time.

538
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:38.541
-Oh. you want some alone time?
-Mm-hmm.

539
00:27:38.625 --> 00:27:39.916
Okay. I'll go then.

540
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.250
-No. No. no. wait…
-[chuckles]

541
00:27:42.333 --> 00:27:43.875
Alone with you.

542
00:27:43.958 --> 00:27:45.166
Ah.

[sighs]

545
00:27:48.541 --> 00:27:49.541
It's been too long.

546
00:27:50.666 --> 00:27:52.291
-Far too long.
-Mm-hmm.

547
00:27:55.833 --> 00:27:57.041
Take off your shirt.

[Elvis] Oh. baby.

554
00:28:27.875 --> 00:28:29.041
-What?
-What?

555
00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:31.625
What did you just say?

556
00:28:33.208 --> 00:28:34.208
"Oh. baby."

557
00:28:34.291 --> 00:28:36.875
Really. Elvis?
Is that all you can think about? Baby?

558
00:28:36.958 --> 00:28:40.583
I mean from the time we got here.
it's just Baby. Baby. Baby. all the time.

559
00:28:40.666 --> 00:28:42.166
I wasn't thinking about her.

560
00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:43.083
Please. just…

561
00:28:43.166 --> 00:28:44.041
-Hey.
-No.

562

-Someone's coming.
-What?

567
00:28:52.958 --> 00:28:55.375
I heard someone coming. Get up. Let's go

[chuckles]

569
00:29:04.125 --> 00:29:05.208
You also can't sleep?

570
00:29:05.791 --> 00:29:07.291
[scoffs] Too much coffee.

571
00:29:07.375 --> 00:29:10.375
I'm still a bit jet lagged.
At least you can keep me company.

572
00:29:11.041 --> 00:29:12.500
[chuckles] Okay.

573
00:29:15.083 --> 00:29:16.208
You want something?

574
00:29:16.291 --> 00:29:19.291
Uh. no. I'm. I'm good.
Thanks. Auntie Baby.

577
00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:26.750
Get rid of her.

578
00:29:26.833 --> 00:29:28.416
I think… I'm trying. I'm trying.

579
00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.791
-[Jodi] Why don't you…
-Let me think. Let me think.

580
00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.250
Can you only think
with one head at a time?

581
00:29:33.333 --> 00:29:35.125
[Prishen] I'm sorry.

-You want some milk. my boy?
-No! He. uh. he wet the bed.

585
00:29:46.708 --> 00:29:49.208
Oh yeah. shame. I heard about that.

586
00:29:49.291 --> 00:29:51.083
So. you're a big shot doctor now?

587
00:29:51.958 --> 00:29:53.208
How much do you earn exactly?

588
00:29:53.291 --> 00:29:54.500
[Prishen] Oh!

589
00:29:54.583 --> 00:29:56.833
Oh my God!

590

Desan. what is wrong with you.
I'm so sorry. Auntie Baby.

Good night. Auntie Baby.

[Shanti] It's not a holiday
if you won't take all the free things:

604
00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:48.208

[Shanti] So. this is where
Preggie went this morning.

Shanti. she doesn't allow me to cook.
Am I right. babe?

Oh. please.

703
00:37:33.791 --> 00:37:35.875
[Baby] Hey. Elvis. catch me if you can.

704
00:37:35.958 --> 00:37:39.250
And look at that one.
gallivanting with my husband.

705
00:37:39.833 --> 00:37:41.416
[Aya] If I was you. I'd boot her.

706
00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:44.250
If she doesn't have any issue
with Martin being married then…

707
00:37:44.333 --> 00:37:45.166
Who's Martin?

708
00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:48.541
[Baby] Elvis. you need much more stamina
that if you want to catch up with me.

709
00:37:48.625 --> 00:37:49.625
[Elvis] Okay. I'm coming.

710
00:37:49.708 --> 00:37:53.041
Maybe Martin is the one
responsible for her rough patch.

711
00:37:54.125 --> 00:37:55.000
Mm-huh.

712
00:37:55.083 --> 00:37:57.000
I don't believe any of her stories.

713
00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:58.958
You know what I think we should do?

714
00:37:59.041 --> 00:38:02.125
I think we need to get her
to open up to us.

715
00:38:02.208 --> 00:38:05.500
Then. we can figure out a way
to send her packing back to China.

716
00:38:06.333 --> 00:38:10.000
Well. we haven't been the most welcoming
to her from the time she arrived.

717
00:38:11.458 --> 00:38:12.500
I can help you.

718
00:38:12.583 --> 00:38:14.625
Aw. how are you gonna help us?

719
00:38:15.333 --> 00:38:16.541
Everybody comes to me

720
00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:20.000
Cause you know what?
I've got a trusting face.

721
00:38:20.083 --> 00:38:22.791
[chuckles]
And I've got Aishwarya Rai face.

722
00:38:22.875 --> 00:38:24.125
[laughing]

723
00:38:24.875 --> 00:38:30.000
But she's right because Baby won't
suspect a thing from a little old lady.

724
00:38:30.708 --> 00:38:33.666
Please. don't let
that little old lady fool you.

725
00:38:35.333 --> 00:38:37.500
So. what's in it for me?

726
00:38:38.791 --> 00:38:40.291
Told you. See?

727
00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:43.916
I'll take you to the market.

728
00:38:44.416 --> 00:38:45.250
No. thanks.

729
00:38:45.791 --> 00:38:47.041
But you love the market.

730
00:38:48.333 --> 00:38:50.250
I also love the casino.

731
00:38:50.333 --> 00:38:53.791
Okay. I'll take you
extra time to the casino once a week.

732
00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:56.583
Twice a week.

733
00:38:56.666 --> 00:39:01.333
No. One extra hour once a week.
and I won't tell Elvis where you were.

734
00:39:02.791 --> 00:39:04.708
-Deal.
-Fine.

735
00:39:04.791 --> 00:39:06.916
[peaceful music playing]

736
00:39:11.583 --> 00:39:15.500
Lot of suitors I got.
Must be something about me.

737
00:39:15.583 --> 00:39:17.833
[chuckles] Aya. you kill me.

738
00:39:17.916 --> 00:39:19.791
Me too. I'm also dying. [laughs]

739
00:39:20.833 --> 00:39:21.875
[Jennifer] No Baby.

740
00:39:21.958 --> 00:39:22.833
[chuckles]

741
00:39:23.583 --> 00:39:26.208
We actually have
our husbands all to ourselves.

742
00:39:26.291 --> 00:39:27.125
Exactly.

743
00:39:28.416 --> 00:39:30.625
-Where are they?
-[Shanti] Why are they taking so long?

744
00:39:31.333 --> 00:39:32.416
What do I tell them?

745
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.833
I think we should
stay out of this one. babe.

746
00:39:35.833 --> 00:39:36.833
Okay.

747
00:39:36.916 --> 00:39:37.916
I love you.

748
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.208
Love you too. Bye.

749
00:39:43.791 --> 00:39:47.750
It's so nice of Jennifer to do this. huh?
She must be such a kindhearted woman.

750
00:39:48.333 --> 00:39:50.458
Must be. I don't know.

751
00:39:50.541 --> 00:39:51.375
[chuckles]

752
00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:55.333
Such a beautiful girl like yourself.
Why you not married?

753
00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:00.458
Can we have two cocktails. please?

754
00:40:00.541 --> 00:40:02.583
Hey. enough now. man. I am full.

755
00:40:04.708 --> 00:40:07.041
-[Preggie] Hey. Elvis. I’m on.
-Pull man. pull.

756
00:40:07.125 --> 00:40:08.125
-I am pulling.
-Reel!

757
00:40:08.208 --> 00:40:09.541
-I am reeling.
-Come on!

758
00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:11.916
You know what this means?

759
00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.166
I… I don't know what this means.

760
00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:16.333
Yeah. means your laddie knows nothing.

761
00:40:16.416 --> 00:40:17.250
[laughing]

762
00:40:17.333 --> 00:40:18.333
[phone rings]

763
00:40:18.416 --> 00:40:19.250
Hey…

764
00:40:20.041 --> 00:40:21.833
-[phone rings]
-Jennifer.

765
00:40:21.916 --> 00:40:23.166
Not now.

766
00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:24.208
[phone rings]

767
00:40:24.791 --> 00:40:25.750
[Elvis] Hey. Love.

768
00:40:25.833 --> 00:40:28.458
Where are you? Are you guys at the beach?

769
00:40:28.541 --> 00:40:30.250
[Elvis] No. we are at the shop.

770
00:40:30.833 --> 00:40:33.583
Yeah. yeah. this lady got a bit sick

771
00:40:33.666 --> 00:40:36.416
and Prishen doesn't wanna take
any chances.

772
00:40:37.208 --> 00:40:38.375
Yeah. of course.

773
00:40:38.458 --> 00:40:41.666
[Elvis] It's funny. man.
We wanted to spend some time with you

774
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:45.791
at the picnic. but. love.
seems like we can't make it. huh?

775
00:40:46.375 --> 00:40:47.666
Oh. don't worry about it.

776
00:40:48.916 --> 00:40:50.625
Okay. love. Bye.

777
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:53.916
[chuckling]

778
00:40:55.458 --> 00:40:57.833
Bro. it's a shark. man.

779
00:40:57.916 --> 00:40:59.333
-[Elvis] Huh?
-A shark.

780
00:41:01.666 --> 00:41:02.583
What's going on?

781
00:41:03.416 --> 00:41:04.250
What?

782
00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:06.083
[sighs]

783
00:41:07.208 --> 00:41:10.708
All this time in China.
no one's chopsticks you liked?

784
00:41:10.791 --> 00:41:12.750
Hey. you're terrible. [chuckles]

785
00:41:13.958 --> 00:41:16.208
But not one person
read your fortune cookie?

786
00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:19.250
Thank God. Here. drink this.

787
00:41:19.958 --> 00:41:21.625
-What's this?
-Just taste it.

788
00:41:25.875 --> 00:41:26.708
Mm…

789
00:41:27.666 --> 00:41:28.500
Nice.

790
00:41:29.166 --> 00:41:32.833
Hey. I have been wasting my time
drinking coconut water all this time.

791
00:41:33.458 --> 00:41:36.833
The casino is just a few minutes away.
What you say. Aya?

792
00:41:37.375 --> 00:41:39.375
Hey. Elvis don't like when I go. huh?

793
00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:41.791
I won't say if you won't.

794
00:41:46.916 --> 00:41:47.875
Cheers.

795
00:41:50.666 --> 00:41:54.208
[Elvis] So. uh. what you told Jodi
about where we are?

796
00:41:55.083 --> 00:41:56.750
[Prishen]
I told her the truth. Uncle Elvis.

797
00:41:56.833 --> 00:41:58.791
Hey. what's wrong with you?

798
00:41:58.875 --> 00:42:01.500
[sighs] She won't tell anyone
if that's what you are worried about.

799
00:42:01.583 --> 00:42:04.000
[chuckles] That's my laddie.

800
00:42:05.125 --> 00:42:10.291
Dad. the truth. like a dead fish.
always finds its way to the surface.

801
00:42:10.375 --> 00:42:11.291
[chuckles]

802
00:42:13.916 --> 00:42:14.750
Hey. laddie…

803
00:42:16.291 --> 00:42:18.000
you mustn't worry about the truth.

804
00:42:18.708 --> 00:42:20.958
You must focus on keeping the peace.

805
00:42:22.041 --> 00:42:26.250
You see. if you keep the peace.
you extend the marriage lease.

806
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.541
Sometimes. the truth gets in the way.

807
00:42:30.416 --> 00:42:32.166
I totally disagree. Uncle Elvis.

808
00:42:32.708 --> 00:42:36.583
Cool. Preggs. he totally disagrees.

809
00:42:36.666 --> 00:42:39.666
Ooh. using big man's words. huh?

810
00:42:40.333 --> 00:42:42.750
[laughing]

811
00:42:43.458 --> 00:42:45.625
Come on. I mean.

812
00:42:45.708 --> 00:42:49.000
we've been watching the way
you and Prishen look at each other.

813
00:42:49.083 --> 00:42:50.500
With bedroom eyes.

814
00:42:51.333 --> 00:42:52.291
What?

815
00:42:52.916 --> 00:42:54.375
Bedroom eyes. man.

816
00:42:54.458 --> 00:42:57.083
Like when you are in the mood to do rude.

817
00:42:59.000 --> 00:42:59.833
What?

818
00:43:03.875 --> 00:43:04.708
[chuckles]

819
00:43:05.916 --> 00:43:07.208
[laughing]

820
00:43:07.291 --> 00:43:09.458
[Jennifer]
You look like you're constipated.

821
00:43:09.541 --> 00:43:12.375
[laughing]

822
00:43:12.458 --> 00:43:13.791
[laughing]

823
00:43:13.875 --> 00:43:17.416
Hey. we saw how you always
turn to Jodi to check for everything.

824
00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:18.458
Yeah.

825
00:43:18.541 --> 00:43:22.000
See. I will be Jodi. right?
Come here. come here. Come close.

826
00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:24.458
-Closer. closer.
-Hey Elvis. now I hold.

827
00:43:24.583 --> 00:43:25.666
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

828
00:43:26.375 --> 00:43:27.666
[kisses. sighs]

829
00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:29.541
What you say. Prishen?

830
00:43:30.875 --> 00:43:33.750
Can I go to the shop? Can I go to the gym?

831
00:43:33.833 --> 00:43:36.375
-Ah. we don't sound like that.
-Yeah.

832
00:43:36.458 --> 00:43:38.000
-Come here. Come here.
-Go. go.

833
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:39.916
Tighter. tighter.

834
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.958
-Tighter. right? Close enough?
-Hmm!

835
00:43:42.791 --> 00:43:43.625
[smacks lips]

836
00:43:44.541 --> 00:43:47.500
-What you say. Prishen? [kisses]
-[laughing]

837
00:43:47.583 --> 00:43:48.416
Can I sleep now?

838
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.041
Can I eat now?

839
00:43:50.125 --> 00:43:51.166
Can I drink now?

840
00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:52.541
Tell me what to do now.

841
00:43:52.625 --> 00:43:53.708
[laughing]

842
00:43:54.666 --> 00:43:57.291
-I don't sound like that.
-Hey. hey. hey.

843
00:43:57.375 --> 00:44:01.208
We saw with our own two eyes how you
turn and check with Jodi for everything.

844
00:44:01.291 --> 00:44:02.291
Yeah.

845
00:44:02.375 --> 00:44:04.750
-Your neck is not sprained. laddie?
-Huh?

846
00:44:04.833 --> 00:44:07.583
-Swing. swing. swing.
-Swing. swing. swing.

847
00:44:07.666 --> 00:44:09.375
[laughing]

848
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.583
[indistinct chatter]

849
00:44:12.791 --> 00:44:14.333
[laughing]

850
00:44:14.875 --> 00:44:17.958
[Elvis] We were so convincing.
We said that the lady was sick.

851
00:44:18.041 --> 00:44:20.333
He was even making
the sounds of a sick lady.

852
00:44:20.416 --> 00:44:22.375
Save me! Quick!

853
00:44:22.458 --> 00:44:23.583
[laughing]

854
00:44:25.416 --> 00:44:27.208
-Hey.
-Hi.

855
00:44:28.041 --> 00:44:29.375
What are you laughing at?

856
00:44:30.625 --> 00:44:32.416
Lucky. I marinated extra meat. huh?

857
00:44:32.958 --> 00:44:35.083
That fish you've bought is so small.

858
00:44:35.166 --> 00:44:37.541
Exactly. So why would you guys
even buy them?

859
00:44:37.625 --> 00:44:41.541
You all can't choose. That's the problem.
Look at this. This looks like sardines.

860
00:44:42.041 --> 00:44:43.166
Except for this one.

861
00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:44.500
-Yeah.
-This one's a decent size.

862
00:44:44.583 --> 00:44:46.041
Hey. that's the one I caught.

863
00:44:51.708 --> 00:44:52.750
You caught?

864
00:44:59.291 --> 00:45:00.250
Come on. Shanti.

865
00:45:01.125 --> 00:45:03.791
Let's go. I suddenly lost my appetite.

866
00:45:09.166 --> 00:45:11.666
So. uh. Dad… [clears throat]

867
00:45:12.458 --> 00:45:14.333
How's the neck there? Feeling sprained?

868
00:45:14.416 --> 00:45:15.833
Hey. hey. hey. hey.

869
00:45:18.916 --> 00:45:21.125
-This Baby will be the death of me.
-[grunts]

870
00:45:22.458 --> 00:45:25.125
She comes back to Chatsworth with us.
we are finished.

871
00:45:27.666 --> 00:45:28.666
What a thing.

872
00:45:33.166 --> 00:45:34.125
And?

873
00:45:34.208 --> 00:45:35.458
I have big ears.

874
00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:37.916
What did you find out. Aya?

875
00:45:38.791 --> 00:45:39.750
I don't know.

876
00:45:39.833 --> 00:45:41.500
-What you found out?

I'm actually at her apartment now.
I was hoping…

898

She won't even know anyone there.

899
00:46:34.541 --> 00:46:37.666

ask your father if he wants tea.

You take your wives for granted.

Just stop. or it will be too late.
Cause why?

Something about the birth of a baby.

Maybe it makes us feel hopeful.

1477
