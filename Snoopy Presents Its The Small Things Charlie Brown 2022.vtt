3
00:01:07.943 --> 00:01:09.111
Yay!

4
00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:18.328
Hooray! You did it. Charlie Brown.

5
00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:21.290
-Hooray!
-Way to go. Charlie Brown.

6
00:01:21.373 --> 00:01:22.791
Yay!

7
00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:28.338
Yay!

8
00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:32.968
Charlie Brown!
Charlie Brown! Charlie Brown!

9
00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:34.928
Way to go. Charlie Brown.

10
00:01:39.558 --> 00:01:40.767
Who did--

11
00:01:58.368 --> 00:02:01.288
Why can't I have a normal dog.
like everyone else?

12
00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:12.883
Good morning. Linus.

13
00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:15.427
Good morning. Charlie Brown.

14
00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:28.065
I had that same dream again last night.

15
00:02:30.651 --> 00:02:32.319
Which one was that. Charlie Brown?

16
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.115
The one where
we finally beat Peppermint Patty's team.

17
00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:44.498
Think it might be a sign that this year's
going to be our year to win the pennant.

18
00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:46.875
You said that about last year.

19
00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:49.086
and the year before that.

20
00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.089
and the year before that.

21
00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:55.217
Yes. but it's different this time.

22
00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:57.636
We've been training really hard.

23
00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.638
Our batting skills are better.

24
00:02:59.721 --> 00:03:01.849
Our throwing skills have improved.

25
00:03:01.932 --> 00:03:04.142
I'm positive that we're going to win.

26
00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.729
I don't know. Charlie Brown.

27
00:03:07.813 --> 00:03:10.691
Peppermint Patty and her team
have won the neighborhood pennant

28
00:03:10.774 --> 00:03:12.568
every year since she moved here.

29
00:03:18.282 --> 00:03:19.491
That may be true.

30
00:03:19.575 --> 00:03:24.121
Tomorrow. I believe we will finally have
another pennant to raise on our flagpole.

31
00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:36.842
I admire your confidence in the face
of overwhelming odds. Charlie Brown.

32
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.601
Nice throw.

33
00:03:46.185 --> 00:03:47.686
Keep your knees up. Shermy.

34
00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.188
That's a five-star move.

35
00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:51.356
-Two. three. four.
-Good energy. Pigpen.

36
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.774
Hi-yah!

37
00:03:53.317 --> 00:03:56.361
-Great swing. Lucy.
-Thanks. Charlie Brown.

38
00:03:58.488 --> 00:03:59.615
All right. team.

39
00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:02.451
This is our last practice
before the big game tomorrow.

40
00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:04.912
which we are going to win.

41
00:04:04.995 --> 00:04:06.455
Wait.

42
00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:07.915
Has anyone seen Snoopy?

43
00:04:25.724 --> 00:04:28.310
My dog. The all-star.

44
00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:38.695
Okay. Let's get started.

45
00:04:39.905 --> 00:04:41.073
I've got it.

46
00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:55.963
Grounder!

47
00:04:59.216 --> 00:05:00.342
Ball hog.

48
00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:02.344
Great hustle. gang.

49
00:05:03.095 --> 00:05:05.305
Out of the way. This one's mine.

50
00:05:17.818 --> 00:05:19.653
My naturally curly hair!

51
00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:22.781
Good grief.

52
00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:24.992
Hello. big brother.

53
00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:27.619
Your star player has arrived.

54
00:05:29.955 --> 00:05:31.164
My star player?

55
00:05:31.248 --> 00:05:32.165
That's right.

56
00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:35.711
You promised me. when I turn five.
I can join your team.

57
00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:37.087
Remember?

58
00:05:38.172 --> 00:05:40.007
It's been a whole year already?

59
00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:47.097
Okay. Sally.

60
00:05:47.181 --> 00:05:48.640
A promise is a promise.

61
00:05:48.724 --> 00:05:49.975
Let's get you suited up.

62
00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:01.153
Thank you. big brother.

63
00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:03.989
Or should I say. "manager"?

64
00:06:06.158 --> 00:06:08.535
All right. Let's see what you got.

65
00:06:10.621 --> 00:06:14.583
I've waited my whole life for this moment.

66
00:06:19.505 --> 00:06:21.048
That's okay. Sally.

67
00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:22.299
You might not believe it.

68
00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:25.052
but I wasn't always
the great pitcher you see before you.

69
00:06:28.514 --> 00:06:31.433
Get ready to see
what I can bring to your team.

70
00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:05.259
I got it. I got it.

71
00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:10.472
I don't got it.

72
00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:14.643
I guess I'm just not ready for this.

73
00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:18.772
Listen. Sally. I'm sure--

74
00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:22.442
Oh. no. It's Peppermint Patty.

75
00:08:03.901 --> 00:08:06.236
Hey. guys. Wait for me.

76
00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:16.788
Hey there. Chuck. ol' boy.

77
00:08:16.872 --> 00:08:20.250
I thought I'd ride through and see
if you're ready to lose another pennant

78
00:08:20.334 --> 00:08:22.920
to the better half
of the neighborhood tomorrow.

79
00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:24.922
Not this year. Peppermint Patty.

80
00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:28.050
My team is in shipshape condition
and ready to go.

81
00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:30.719
Have you ever seen
a better-looking group of players?

82
00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:37.726
Whatever you say. Chuck.

83
00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:42.188
Hey. Coach.
do we really have to play here?

84
00:08:42.272 --> 00:08:45.776
It looks more like a landfill
than a ball field.

85
00:08:46.485 --> 00:08:49.905
Yeah. and dirtier
than their third baseman.

86
00:08:52.616 --> 00:08:54.117
Look. Chuck.

87
00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:57.538
I could be nice to you tomorrow
and throw a few innings.

88
00:08:57.621 --> 00:09:01.041
but you wouldn't want that. would you?

89
00:09:02.793 --> 00:09:05.671
Don't you worry about us.
Peppermint Patty.

90
00:09:05.754 --> 00:09:07.047
We'll be ready.

91
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.132
I like your spirit. Chuck.

92
00:09:09.633 --> 00:09:14.513
I look forward to handing you
a good old-fashioned clobbering tomorrow.

93
00:09:23.856 --> 00:09:25.983
I finally turned five.

94
00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:30.696
only to find out I'm still too small
to play baseball with the team.

95
00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:52.759
Why. hello. little flower.

96
00:09:55.846 --> 00:09:58.015
What are you doing
out here all by yourself?

97
00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:04.730
Do you ever feel
like you just don't fit in?

98
00:10:09.318 --> 00:10:11.236
Yeah. me too.

99
00:10:11.737 --> 00:10:13.697
I think we have a lot in common.

100
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.381
Small guys like us.

101
00:10:32.216 --> 00:10:33.634
we ought to stick together.

102
00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:38.722
Don't worry. I'll look out for you.

103
00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:40.182
I promise.

104
00:11:03.956 --> 00:11:05.999
Don't listen
to what Peppermint Patty said.

105
00:11:06.083 --> 00:11:08.752
She's not your manager. I am.

106
00:11:08.836 --> 00:11:10.170
I know we can win.

107
00:11:10.254 --> 00:11:13.048
We just need to stick together
and play as a team.

108
00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:15.801
Why do you make us
go through this routine every year?

109
00:11:15.884 --> 00:11:19.805
No matter what we try.
the result is always the same.

110
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:22.474
Peppermint Patty wins.

111
00:11:22.558 --> 00:11:24.268
And we lose.

112
00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:26.770
That's for sure. She's got a point there.

113
00:11:26.854 --> 00:11:28.605
What's the matter with you guys?

114
00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:30.649
Where is your confidence?

115
00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:33.652
Have faith that this year
will be different.

116
00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:36.905
We've done our homework.
We know their strengths.

117
00:11:36.989 --> 00:11:38.574
And we know their weaknesses.

118
00:11:38.657 --> 00:11:40.117
By sundown tomorrow.

119
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.704
I guarantee we'll be raising
another pennant up on that flagpole.

120
00:11:43.787 --> 00:11:45.289
But only if you believe.

121
00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:47.207
Are you with me?

122
00:11:51.628 --> 00:11:53.755
Yay! Hooray!

123
00:11:53.839 --> 00:11:55.215
Yay! Yay!

124
00:11:55.299 --> 00:11:56.508
Come on. team.

125
00:11:56.592 --> 00:11:59.261
Go. go. go! Let's hit that field.

126
00:11:59.845 --> 00:12:01.221
Yay!

127
00:12:02.931 --> 00:12:04.558
You've got to be kidding me.

128
00:12:04.641 --> 00:12:05.893
This is ridiculous.

129
00:12:05.976 --> 00:12:07.936
-Seriously?
-What is she doing?

130
00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.479
Sally?

131
00:12:09.563 --> 00:12:10.898
Hello. big brother.

132
00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:12.649
Can you move. please?

133
00:12:12.733 --> 00:12:14.484
You're sort of in the way.

134
00:12:14.568 --> 00:12:16.153
She's fully in the way.

135
00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:17.613
-You said it. Franklin.
-Yeah.

136
00:12:17.696 --> 00:12:18.989
-Uh-huh.
-That's right.

137
00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:20.657
This is a travesty.

138
00:12:20.741 --> 00:12:24.661
Isn't this the most beautiful flower
you've ever seen?

139
00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:28.457
Flower? It's a dandelion.

140
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.043
Dandelions are weeds. Sally.

141
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.253
Don't call her that.

142
00:12:33.337 --> 00:12:35.464
You're going to hurt her feelings.

143
00:12:35.547 --> 00:12:39.551
She's a beautiful little flower.
and she deserves to be admired.

144
00:12:39.635 --> 00:12:41.637
It's also on the pitcher's mound.

145
00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.263
It's going to be trampled.

146
00:12:43.347 --> 00:12:45.390
I'm not going to let that happen.

147
00:12:45.474 --> 00:12:48.560
She's my friend.
and I made a promise to protect her.

148
00:12:48.644 --> 00:12:49.853
What?

149
00:12:49.937 --> 00:12:52.523
I thought you said we had to practice.

150
00:12:52.606 --> 00:12:55.025
Yeah. Let's get this show on the road!

151
00:12:56.485 --> 00:12:57.986
Settle down. everyone.

152
00:12:58.070 --> 00:12:59.196
I'll handle this.

153
00:13:00.531 --> 00:13:04.201
Sally. I'll bet you didn't know Mom made
your favorite cookies this morning.

154
00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:06.828
Maybe if you hurry home.
she'll give you one.

155
00:13:09.498 --> 00:13:12.209
I will not be manipulated.

156
00:13:13.043 --> 00:13:15.629
Perhaps you should try
a different approach.

157
00:13:16.255 --> 00:13:18.549
-Such as?
-The Socratic method.

158
00:13:18.632 --> 00:13:23.053
It's a form of argumentative dialogue
based on asking and answering questions

159
00:13:23.136 --> 00:13:24.972
to stimulate critical thinking.

160
00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:26.932
Socratic what?

161
00:13:28.267 --> 00:13:29.601
Begging might also work.

162
00:13:32.771 --> 00:13:33.814
Sally.

163
00:13:34.606 --> 00:13:36.692
please move!

164
00:13:36.775 --> 00:13:38.861
We've got to practice for tomorrow's game.

165
00:13:39.486 --> 00:13:40.696
I'm not moving.

166
00:13:42.948 --> 00:13:45.409
This is just great.

167
00:13:45.492 --> 00:13:47.911
Now we're for sure
not going to win that pennant!

168
00:13:52.291 --> 00:13:54.042
This is a minor setback.

169
00:13:54.126 --> 00:13:55.544
No big deal.

170
00:13:55.627 --> 00:13:57.212
I know my little sister.

171
00:13:57.296 --> 00:13:59.506
She'll get bored and go home soon.

172
00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:02.509
Until then. we can practice around her.

173
00:14:02.593 --> 00:14:04.344
Everyone. take your positions.

174
00:14:13.979 --> 00:14:16.023
"Once in a golden hour

175
00:14:16.732 --> 00:14:18.692
I cast to earth a seed.

176
00:14:19.735 --> 00:14:22.112
Up there came a flower.

177
00:14:22.988 --> 00:14:25.115
The people said. a weed."

178
00:14:31.663 --> 00:14:32.581
Mine. mine!

179
00:14:52.601 --> 00:14:54.061
Strike three!

180
00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:55.187
Rats!

181
00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:15.082
Sally? I know we had our differences.
but look.

182
00:15:15.165 --> 00:15:17.000
I brought you some of Mom's cookies.

183
00:15:38.397 --> 00:15:39.648
She'll be back.

184
00:15:39.731 --> 00:15:40.774
I hope.

185
00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:45.279
That lumpy old mound
can't be very comfortable.

186
00:15:45.779 --> 00:15:48.073
By morning.
everything will be back to normal.

187
00:16:11.305 --> 00:16:12.431
Game day.

188
00:16:18.604 --> 00:16:20.314
Wish me luck. Joe.

189
00:16:22.858 --> 00:16:26.987
Charlie Brown!
Charlie Brown! Charlie Brown!

190
00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:33.285
Charlie Brown! Charlie Brown!
Charlie Brown!

191
00:16:33.368 --> 00:16:35.662
Charlie… Brown?

192
00:16:35.746 --> 00:16:37.331
Good morning. big brother.

193
00:16:37.414 --> 00:16:40.125
Sally. what in the world are you doing?

194
00:16:40.209 --> 00:16:42.794
You can't keep sitting
on the pitcher's mound forever.

195
00:16:42.878 --> 00:16:44.213
Yes. I can!

196
00:16:44.296 --> 00:16:47.132
I made a promise.
and I'm not going to break it.

197
00:16:47.925 --> 00:16:49.051
Can't you see?

198
00:16:49.134 --> 00:16:50.969
This flower needs me.

199
00:16:51.053 --> 00:16:53.222
But today's the championship game.

200
00:16:53.305 --> 00:16:55.807
Don't you have any idea
what's at stake here?

201
00:16:55.891 --> 00:16:57.059
I sure do.

202
00:16:57.142 --> 00:16:59.353
And it's not your game.

203
00:16:59.937 --> 00:17:02.940
What's important is this little flower.

204
00:17:03.023 --> 00:17:05.442
But it's not a flower. It's a weed.

205
00:17:05.526 --> 00:17:07.027
I don't believe it.

206
00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:08.862
She's still here!

207
00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:11.698
What happened to.
"I know my little sister"?

208
00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:14.785
When has Charlie Brown
ever done anything right?

209
00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:17.954
Big brother.
can you take this conversation elsewhere?

210
00:17:18.038 --> 00:17:20.749
All this conflict
is making my flower nervous.

211
00:17:21.333 --> 00:17:22.542
All right. everyone.

212
00:17:22.626 --> 00:17:24.336
Just give me some time to think.

213
00:17:28.841 --> 00:17:31.510
Thank you for opening up
before the game today. Lucy.

214
00:17:32.261 --> 00:17:34.346
I'm in desperate need of some help.

215
00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:36.890
You've come to the right place then.
Charlie Brown.

216
00:17:36.974 --> 00:17:40.060
There's no one more qualified
to solve your problems than me.

217
00:17:40.143 --> 00:17:41.353
Let me pull your file.

218
00:17:47.401 --> 00:17:48.527
Go on.

219
00:17:51.321 --> 00:17:53.282
Actually. it's about Sally.

220
00:17:53.365 --> 00:17:55.284
She still won't move
from the pitcher's mound.

221
00:17:55.367 --> 00:17:57.369
and today's the championship game.

222
00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.955
I thought maybe you could talk to her.

223
00:18:02.124 --> 00:18:04.209
I don't normally make field calls.

224
00:18:05.127 --> 00:18:07.504
This is going to cost you
an extra five cents.

225
00:18:10.507 --> 00:18:13.969
Would you take three cents
and a butterscotch?

226
00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:17.764
I'll do it!

227
00:18:26.148 --> 00:18:28.442
I don't understand
what Sally is trying to prove.

228
00:18:28.525 --> 00:18:31.320
It's just one small. insignificant weed.

229
00:18:32.571 --> 00:18:34.281
Don't worry. Charlie Brown.

230
00:18:34.364 --> 00:18:35.699
I'll handle this.

231
00:18:39.286 --> 00:18:41.038
Lucy's very convincing.

232
00:18:41.121 --> 00:18:42.915
I'm sure this is going to work.

233
00:18:45.501 --> 00:18:47.753
It is. It's working.

234
00:18:47.836 --> 00:18:49.338
Sally's standing.

235
00:18:49.421 --> 00:18:51.590
Any second now she's going to move.

236
00:18:53.884 --> 00:18:54.927
She's sitting!

237
00:18:55.552 --> 00:18:56.720
Don't sit down!

238
00:18:57.721 --> 00:18:59.097
Now Lucy's sitting too?

239
00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:01.558
You're not supposed to be sitting!

240
00:19:01.642 --> 00:19:03.477
You're supposed to be moving!

241
00:19:04.436 --> 00:19:05.854
I demand a refund.

242
00:19:06.355 --> 00:19:08.190
Don't worry. little flower.

243
00:19:08.273 --> 00:19:11.026
Charlie Brown is just here to say hello.

244
00:19:11.527 --> 00:19:12.653
I am?

245
00:19:12.736 --> 00:19:14.279
We won't let him hurt you.

246
00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.740
We? Who's we?

247
00:19:16.823 --> 00:19:18.450
What about the game?

248
00:19:18.534 --> 00:19:20.035
We can't play now.

249
00:19:20.118 --> 00:19:21.870
Don't you see. Charlie Brown?

250
00:19:21.954 --> 00:19:26.875
Sally is a lone spirit. standing up
for her beliefs in the face of adversity.

251
00:19:26.959 --> 00:19:31.088
She's strong.
She's powerful. She's inspiring.

252
00:19:31.588 --> 00:19:34.883
Come to think of it. you know
who she reminds me of. Charlie Brown?

253
00:19:34.967 --> 00:19:35.884
She reminds me of…

254
00:19:36.385 --> 00:19:37.553
me!

255
00:19:38.679 --> 00:19:40.764
I think I made a big mistake.

256
00:19:44.685 --> 00:19:46.895
Attention. fellow citizens.

257
00:19:46.979 --> 00:19:52.150
Sally Brown is taking a stand
to save a poor. defenseless flower.

258
00:19:52.234 --> 00:19:55.070
She has a message that must be heard.

259
00:19:55.153 --> 00:19:57.573
She has a voice that won't be silenced.

260
00:19:59.074 --> 00:20:01.577
Did you hear what Sally Brown is doing?

261
00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:04.538
I heard she sat outside all night
to protect the flower.

262
00:20:04.621 --> 00:20:08.083
I never knew she was such a rebel.
And she's in my class.

263
00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:10.377
Must be a pretty special flower.

264
00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:13.130
-You going?
-I'll bring a plate of hamburger snacks.

265
00:20:13.213 --> 00:20:15.215
Meet you there. And spread the word!

266
00:20:15.299 --> 00:20:17.843
What she doesn't have is you!

267
00:20:17.926 --> 00:20:20.888
That's right. she needs your help.

268
00:20:20.971 --> 00:20:24.600
After all. flowers can't
protect themselves. can they?

269
00:20:24.683 --> 00:20:28.061
So be like Sally. take a stand!

270
00:20:28.145 --> 00:20:30.439
Join us for the sit-in on the mound.

271
00:20:30.522 --> 00:20:32.900
Tell your friends. spread the word!

272
00:20:32.983 --> 00:20:36.403
Exercise your First Amendment rights!

273
00:20:48.749 --> 00:20:51.126
What in the world is this?

274
00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:53.337
You were supposed
to get rid of your sister.

275
00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:56.423
Yeah! Not bring back reinforcements!

276
00:20:56.507 --> 00:20:59.468
What's the plan now. Coach?

277
00:20:59.551 --> 00:21:01.011
Well. I…

278
00:21:02.262 --> 00:21:04.681
How are you doing. little flower?

279
00:21:04.765 --> 00:21:06.934
I wish I brought my radio.

280
00:21:07.017 --> 00:21:09.228
I hear flowers really like music.

281
00:21:10.062 --> 00:21:11.563
I could help you with that.

282
00:21:11.647 --> 00:21:14.399
Oh. Schroeder!

283
00:21:14.483 --> 00:21:16.401
We could use your help over here!

284
00:21:16.902 --> 00:21:19.404
Flowers just love classical music.

285
00:21:25.327 --> 00:21:27.079
What about the game?

286
00:21:27.162 --> 00:21:30.207
Baseball games come and go. Charlie Brown.

287
00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:33.877
But a receptive audience
is something I simply cannot turn down.

288
00:21:38.841 --> 00:21:42.386
Wow. little flower.
Look at all your new friends.

289
00:21:42.469 --> 00:21:44.763
You'll never be lonely again.

290
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:48.016
Can you believe it?

291
00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:53.146
On a field like this. Sally found
something beautiful to care about.

292
00:21:54.189 --> 00:21:55.899
I wanna know what it feels like

293
00:21:55.983 --> 00:21:59.611
to care about something
as much as Sally cares about that flower.

294
00:22:02.281 --> 00:22:03.824
Hey! Where are you going?

295
00:22:04.658 --> 00:22:07.119
Wait. let's not make any hasty decisions.

296
00:22:07.202 --> 00:22:08.912
What about the neighborhood pennant?

297
00:22:08.996 --> 00:22:10.497
What about the bragging rights?

298
00:22:10.581 --> 00:22:12.124
What about my championship?

299
00:22:18.755 --> 00:22:20.507
At least you're still with me.

300
00:22:20.591 --> 00:22:21.884
Aren't you. Snoopy?

301
00:22:26.805 --> 00:22:28.182
Not you. too!

302
00:22:28.265 --> 00:22:30.642
Good grief. What's next?

303
00:23:10.891 --> 00:23:13.227
This has really gotten out of control.

304
00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:17.147
Doesn't anyone care about
the championship game anymore?

305
00:23:17.231 --> 00:23:18.607
Can you hear that?

306
00:23:20.359 --> 00:23:25.322
No. no. you've got to listen closer

307
00:23:26.865 --> 00:23:29.826
A dandelion speaks

308
00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:35.123
Don't laugh
She's got some things to teach us

309
00:23:36.124 --> 00:23:39.294
It's the small things
Like us

310
00:23:39.378 --> 00:23:44.925
We come together to make big things

311
00:23:45.634 --> 00:23:47.678
Like a baseball game

312
00:23:48.887 --> 00:23:51.098
It's not just one

313
00:23:51.598 --> 00:23:53.475
It's everyone

314
00:23:53.976 --> 00:23:55.894
And to be fair

315
00:23:56.603 --> 00:24:01.275
We don't own this ground
Charlie Brown

316
00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:04.278
We share it

317
00:24:05.112 --> 00:24:07.823
So whoa up!
Slow down

318
00:24:07.906 --> 00:24:09.908
There's life on the mound

319
00:24:09.992 --> 00:24:12.828
Can you hear the sound?

320
00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:17.249
It's the small things. Charlie Brown

321
00:24:18.834 --> 00:24:22.171
Can't you see yourself?
Right there

322
00:24:22.254 --> 00:24:27.050
That's you. alone
You're a lonely flower

323
00:24:28.427 --> 00:24:31.054
But a field of us. you know

324
00:24:31.638 --> 00:24:36.810
We make a team and that's our power

325
00:24:36.894 --> 00:24:38.979
So be aware

326
00:24:39.771 --> 00:24:42.274
Of where you step

327
00:24:42.357 --> 00:24:48.197
And what and who
You might be stepping on

328
00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.532
Look up
Look now

329
00:24:50.616 --> 00:24:52.618
So huge
So wow

330
00:24:52.701 --> 00:24:55.412
Let me break it down

331
00:24:56.413 --> 00:25:00.501
Little droplets make big clouds

332
00:25:01.043 --> 00:25:05.088
It's the small things. Charlie Brown

333
00:25:06.715 --> 00:25:10.552
Lots and lots
Of the tiniest dots

334
00:25:10.636 --> 00:25:16.934
Can make shapes
Even faces when viewed far away

335
00:25:17.726 --> 00:25:20.187
And the quietest voice

336
00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:24.733
Could cut through the noise

337
00:25:24.816 --> 00:25:28.570
When it's speaking

338
00:25:29.863 --> 00:25:31.031
The truth

339
00:25:35.786 --> 00:25:37.829
Look up
Look down

340
00:25:37.913 --> 00:25:42.709
The sky and the ground
Getting louder now

341
00:25:44.169 --> 00:25:47.840
The voice of the bravest flower

342
00:25:48.632 --> 00:25:52.845
Too small to hear without

343
00:25:53.345 --> 00:25:57.558
Some perspective. Charlie Brown

344
00:25:58.141 --> 00:26:04.648
Do the right thing
Are you with me. Charlie Brown?

345
00:26:12.948 --> 00:26:14.867
How could this get any worse?

346
00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:31.717
Hey. Chuck. ol' boy.

347
00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.468
Ready for the big game?

348
00:26:33.552 --> 00:26:36.471
Ready to slug it out
for nine long innings?

349
00:26:36.555 --> 00:26:39.766
Ready to see
which team will reign supreme?

350
00:26:45.397 --> 00:26:48.609
What's with the party?
I thought we were playing ball.

351
00:26:51.945 --> 00:26:54.239
I see what's going on here.

352
00:26:54.323 --> 00:26:57.201
The old infield sit-in maneuver.

353
00:26:57.284 --> 00:27:00.954
Nice try. Chuck.
but it's not going to work.

354
00:27:01.038 --> 00:27:02.039
Yeah!

355
00:27:03.081 --> 00:27:06.376
You got your own sister
to camp out on the mound

356
00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:08.921
so we can't clobber you at the plate?

357
00:27:09.004 --> 00:27:12.090
You think if we can't play.
then you can't lose?

358
00:27:12.591 --> 00:27:13.884
Is that it. Chuck?

359
00:27:13.967 --> 00:27:15.844
No. I want to play.

360
00:27:15.928 --> 00:27:20.224
It's just that this dandelion
seems to mean a lot to a lot of people.

361
00:27:20.807 --> 00:27:22.643
Especially my little sister.

362
00:27:22.726 --> 00:27:26.980
I get it. The old dandelion excuse.

363
00:27:27.064 --> 00:27:30.067
Heard it a million times. Chuck.

364
00:27:30.651 --> 00:27:34.404
We'll just mark this game down
as a loss for you. due to a forfeit.

365
00:27:34.488 --> 00:27:37.950
-Yes!
-Champions again!

366
00:27:38.033 --> 00:27:41.411
What kind of manager
can't even keep his team together?

367
00:27:41.912 --> 00:27:43.705
Don't listen to them. Chuck.

368
00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:46.166
We all know
how tough a five-year-old can be.

369
00:27:46.667 --> 00:27:49.461
Little sisters always win
against their big brothers.

370
00:27:49.962 --> 00:27:53.048
And hey. remember.
there's always next year.

371
00:27:55.884 --> 00:27:56.927
Next year?

372
00:28:02.015 --> 00:28:06.520
Charlie Brown!
Charlie Brown! Charlie Brown!

373
00:28:06.603 --> 00:28:07.980
Hold it right there.

374
00:28:08.939 --> 00:28:10.649
This game isn't over yet.

375
00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:14.069
I don't need to get everyone to leave.

376
00:28:14.152 --> 00:28:16.154
I just need the dandelion to leave.

377
00:28:16.238 --> 00:28:18.156
And then everyone else will follow.

378
00:28:37.426 --> 00:28:38.760
Out of the way. Sally.

379
00:28:42.472 --> 00:28:44.766
Sorry. but this has to be done.

380
00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:46.643
Not a chance. big brother.

381
00:28:46.727 --> 00:28:48.979
I won't let you hurt my flower.

382
00:28:50.314 --> 00:28:52.983
Sally. I'm not going to hurt it.

383
00:28:53.066 --> 00:28:54.401
You have to trust me.

384
00:28:54.902 --> 00:28:56.737
Permission denied!

385
00:29:02.618 --> 00:29:03.744
Sally. please.

386
00:29:03.827 --> 00:29:05.704
-No!
-Out of my way.

387
00:29:05.787 --> 00:29:07.039
I said no!

388
00:29:07.122 --> 00:29:09.666
-Please. you don't understand.
-Back off!

389
00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:11.877
Leave us alone!

390
00:29:17.883 --> 00:29:20.260
Sally. I'm just gonna move it!

391
00:29:20.344 --> 00:29:22.888
But I made a promise to her!

392
00:29:29.144 --> 00:29:30.646
Little flower?

393
00:29:32.689 --> 00:29:34.274
Are you okay?

394
00:29:46.161 --> 00:29:47.829
Look what you did!

395
00:29:48.997 --> 00:29:50.207
You killed it.

396
00:29:50.999 --> 00:29:52.793
Sally? I--

397
00:29:52.876 --> 00:29:54.461
I guess you win.

398
00:29:56.672 --> 00:29:58.131
Enjoy your baseball game.

399
00:30:11.478 --> 00:30:12.521
So. Chuck.

400
00:30:13.522 --> 00:30:15.732
now that this flower festival has ended.

401
00:30:16.233 --> 00:30:18.610
do you still want to play for the pennant?

402
00:30:20.487 --> 00:30:21.488
All of a sudden.

403
00:30:21.989 --> 00:30:24.241
it just doesn't
seem all that important to me.

404
00:30:57.524 --> 00:30:58.525
Wow!

405
00:31:46.573 --> 00:31:48.283
Sally. wait!

406
00:31:54.414 --> 00:31:57.167
Sally. wait. If I could just explain.

407
00:31:57.668 --> 00:31:58.961
Go away.

408
00:32:00.963 --> 00:32:03.298
I didn't mean for that
to happen to your flower.

409
00:32:03.382 --> 00:32:05.217
You have to believe me.

410
00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:07.302
You never cared about her.

411
00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:12.349
But I do care about you.

412
00:32:13.725 --> 00:32:16.395
I should have seen
how much that flower meant to you.

413
00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:19.398
instead of focusing so much on baseball.

414
00:32:27.656 --> 00:32:28.740
It's just…

415
00:32:29.825 --> 00:32:32.703
I really cared about this little flower.

416
00:32:35.706 --> 00:32:36.748
I know.

417
00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:42.254
Sally?

418
00:32:43.755 --> 00:32:44.923
I'm sorry.

419
00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:54.224
I know.

420
00:32:57.561 --> 00:32:59.146
There's something you have to see.

421
00:33:18.665 --> 00:33:20.959
You and your flower
really made a difference.

422
00:33:26.507 --> 00:33:28.383
It's beautiful.

423
00:33:29.468 --> 00:33:30.802
I did that?

424
00:34:36.784 --> 00:34:38.661
We could use more mulch. Pigpen.

425
00:34:42.206 --> 00:34:44.960
Remember to space out the plants!

426
00:34:45.043 --> 00:34:47.545
We wanna give those tomatoes room to grow!

427
00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:51.757
Everyone. please gather around.

428
00:34:52.759 --> 00:34:56.597
Thank you all for being here today
for the grand reopening of our ballpark.

429
00:34:56.679 --> 00:35:00.475
A new field and a new beginning
demands a new team mascot.

430
00:35:02.102 --> 00:35:03.353
The Dandelions.

431
00:35:03.437 --> 00:35:05.063
Yay!

432
00:35:05.147 --> 00:35:06.607
What do you think. Sally?

433
00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:07.733
Do you like it?

434
00:35:08.817 --> 00:35:09.985
Do I like it?

435
00:35:10.986 --> 00:35:12.154
I love it!

436
00:35:12.654 --> 00:35:16.033
My little flower friend would be so proud.

437
00:35:16.116 --> 00:35:18.410
There's another surprise I have for you.

438
00:35:23.123 --> 00:35:24.499
Welcome to the team.

439
00:35:26.168 --> 00:35:27.836
Assistant manager!

440
00:35:28.337 --> 00:35:30.380
Me? Really?

441
00:35:34.009 --> 00:35:35.719
This is sweet and all.

442
00:35:35.802 --> 00:35:38.013
but when are we going to start the game?

443
00:35:41.892 --> 00:35:43.602
What are you all standing around for?

444
00:35:43.685 --> 00:35:46.063
Let's play ball!

445
00:35:47.648 --> 00:35:50.067
Come on! Move it. move it. move it!

446
00:35:53.403 --> 00:35:57.157
You know. cleaning up
this ball field has got me thinking.

447
00:35:57.241 --> 00:35:58.951
Maybe we shouldn't stop here.

448
00:35:59.826 --> 00:36:03.664
Wiser words have never been spoken.

449
00:36:17.761 --> 00:36:19.263
Keep your chin up. Chuck.

450
00:36:19.888 --> 00:36:23.600
Winning isn't everything when you got
such a beautiful ballpark to play in.

451
00:36:31.358 --> 00:36:32.401
She is right.

452
00:36:33.861 --> 00:36:35.529
But it would have been nice!
