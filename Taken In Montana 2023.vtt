[dramatic music]

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:40.917
-Can you tell?

5
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.875
I'm feeling more
relaxed already.

6
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.833
-That's great. honey.

7
00:00:44.875 --> 00:00:46.083
-Huh?
-Hmm?

8
00:00:46.167 --> 00:00:47.458
-Oh. you just wait.

9
00:00:47.542 --> 00:00:50.583
You haven't seen mountains
or forests like that.

10
00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:51.667
Look. look!

11
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.500
-Oh yeah.

12
00:00:57.583 --> 00:01:01.000
-Hi. Craig Gerard.
I made a reservation last month.

13
00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:02.875
-I have it right here.

14
00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.167
First time visiting Montana?

15
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.667
-Oh yeah. uh. we're headed up
to Big Sky.

16
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.000
-You'll have your pick of
many beautiful hiking trails.

17
00:01:09.042 --> 00:01:10.083
-Oh. fantastic.
Thank you.

18
00:01:10.167 --> 00:01:11.667
[phone ringing]

00:01:11.708 --> 00:01:13.375
-[scoffs]
Oh crap.

20
00:01:13.458 --> 00:01:15.875
I told them not to call me
this week.

21
00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.417
-You should take that.

22
00:01:18.542 --> 00:01:19.792
-This is Sarah.

23
00:01:21.833 --> 00:01:25.458
No. I can't.

24
00:01:25.542 --> 00:01:28.250
Because I told you
I'm on vacation.

25
00:01:31.708 --> 00:01:32.833
-Hey Dad.

26
00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:34.500
-Yes?

27
00:01:34.542 --> 00:01:35.875
-Can I drive?

28
00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.333
-I don't know. Regan.

29
00:01:37.417 --> 00:01:40.667
-Please? I never get to practice
my driving.

30
00:01:40.792 --> 00:01:42.625
And isn't that the whole reason
we're in Montana.

31
00:01:42.708 --> 00:01:45.542
to get a totally different
experience than New York?

32
00:01:45.667 --> 00:01:49.000
-[chuckles]
Yeah. something like that.

33
00:01:49.083 --> 00:01:50.542
Only if your mom says yes.

34
00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:57.417
Alright. thank you.

35
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.833
-Give the story to Riley then.

36
00:02:00.542 --> 00:02:01.750
Yeah. seriously.

37
00:02:03.292 --> 00:02:06.250
Look. I really need this break.
Okay?

38
00:02:06.375 --> 00:02:09.083
For me and for my family.

39
00:02:10.667 --> 00:02:11.833
Thanks.

40
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.167
-Hey!

41
00:02:16.167 --> 00:02:19.667
Hello. Uh. candy for the road?
Two for $5.

42
00:02:19.792 --> 00:02:20.958
-How much for that?

43
00:02:21.042 --> 00:02:23.625
-My Swiss army knife?

44
00:02:23.708 --> 00:02:24.917
-Yeah.

45
00:02:25.042 --> 00:02:28.000
-Well. this is a very
useful multitool.

46
00:02:28.042 --> 00:02:31.417
-I'm aware.
I'll give you 20 bucks.

47
00:02:31.542 --> 00:02:34.500
-25 and I'll throw in
a chocolate too?

48
00:02:34.542 --> 00:02:35.500
-Deal.

49
00:02:38.708 --> 00:02:40.250
Â´Kay. 25.

50
00:02:42.083 --> 00:02:43.667
-Pleasure doing business
with ya.

51
00:02:44.833 --> 00:02:45.792
-[chuckles]

52
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.167
-What do you need that for?

53
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.250
-Well... take a look out there

54
00:02:56.333 --> 00:02:58.875
at that wilderness
we're heading into.

55
00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.875
You can never be too prepared.

56
00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:05.542
-Okay. So... how do you feel

57
00:03:05.667 --> 00:03:08.833
about helping me prepare
for a potential situation

58
00:03:08.917 --> 00:03:10.417
where I'd need
to drive a car?

59
00:03:15.667 --> 00:03:18.000
-Make sure you slow down
around the curves.

60
00:03:18.083 --> 00:03:20.167
-Yeah. I know. Mom.

61
00:03:20.208 --> 00:03:22.583
-It is really beautiful
out here.

62
00:03:22.708 --> 00:03:23.792
Come on. be honest.

63
00:03:23.875 --> 00:03:26.292
Isn't this better than being
home by yourself?

64
00:03:26.375 --> 00:03:28.667
-Not like I had much
of a choice.

65
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.333
-Okay. let's not
get into that again.

66
00:03:31.417 --> 00:03:34.333
-I'm not getting
into anything again.

67
00:03:34.417 --> 00:03:36.125
I mean. if you guys want
your daughter along

68
00:03:36.208 --> 00:03:39.167
on what could've been a romantic
getaway. then that's on you.

69
00:03:39.208 --> 00:03:40.500
-Okay. okay.

70
00:03:40.542 --> 00:03:42.833
We'll have plenty of time
alone this fall

71
00:03:42.875 --> 00:03:44.458
when you're in college.

72
00:03:44.583 --> 00:03:47.417
-Or hopefully you'll make better
choices than you did this year.

73
00:03:49.125 --> 00:03:51.542
-I thought we weren't getting
into that again?

74
00:03:51.667 --> 00:03:52.833
-Hey! Watch out!

75
00:03:52.917 --> 00:03:53.708
-Whoa. whoa. whoa.
-Rabbit!

76
00:03:53.792 --> 00:03:54.833
-Mom!
-Whoa.

77
00:03:54.917 --> 00:03:56.292
-Mom. you can't yell like that.

78
00:03:56.375 --> 00:03:57.542
-Okay. Shh...

79
00:03:57.667 --> 00:04:00.083
-I'm sorry. I didn't know
if you saw it.

81

-[Sarah] What is he...?

82
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:04.750
-Crap.

83
00:04:04.833 --> 00:04:05.792
-It's okay.

84
00:04:05.875 --> 00:04:07.167
Just. uh... ease up
to the speed limit.

[truck horn honks]

86
00:04:08.208 --> 00:04:09.333
-Okay.

87
00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:11.833
-Just... sweetie. stay calm.

88
00:04:11.875 --> 00:04:12.875
-What is this guy's problem?

00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.792
[truck horn honks]

90
00:04:15.875 --> 00:04:16.958

92
00:04:22.833 --> 00:04:24.250
-Dad.

93
00:04:24.333 --> 00:04:27.000
-What is he doing?
Why didn't he pass us?

94
00:04:27.125 --> 00:04:28.125
-There's nowhere
for me to pull over.

95
00:04:28.208 --> 00:04:30.167
-Okay. Stay calm. sweetie.

96
00:04:30.208 --> 00:04:33.000
He'll pass us when there's
a break to do so.

97
00:04:33.083 --> 00:04:34.250
-[Regan] He's messing with us.

98
00:04:34.333 --> 00:04:35.792
-Alright. there's a turn out
right ahead.

99
00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:36.833
Just go up there. okay?

100
00:04:36.917 --> 00:04:38.500
-Okay.

101

102
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:40.750
Oh my God!

103
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:41.417
-Are you kidding me?

104
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.708
-Okay. Pull over!

105
00:04:45.417 --> 00:04:47.042
-Calm down. calm down.
Go ahead. go ahead.

106
00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:48.792
[truck horn honks]

107
00:04:53.042 --> 00:04:53.833
It's alright.

108
00:04:53.875 --> 00:04:54.917
-He's pulling off too.

109
00:04:57.917 --> 00:04:58.667
-What?

110
00:05:05.333 --> 00:05:06.833
[engine revving]

111
00:05:06.875 --> 00:05:09.917
-Dad. what just happened?

112
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.333
-Are you okay?

113
00:05:11.417 --> 00:05:13.625
-Yeah. no I'm fine.
But what was his problem?

114
00:05:13.708 --> 00:05:16.000
-It's not your fault.
I'll... I'll drive from here.

115
00:05:16.083 --> 00:05:17.667
-Yeah. you drive.
-Gladly.

116
00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.875
I have a new appreciation
for the subway.

117
00:05:25.875 --> 00:05:27.583
-Oh. what now?

118
00:05:27.667 --> 00:05:29.750
-Who knows?
It's probably nothing.

119
00:05:30.792 --> 00:05:31.708
-Hey folks.

120
00:05:31.833 --> 00:05:33.167
-Afternoon.

121
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.042
-Everything okay?

122
00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:35.833
-Uh. yes. Uh...

123
00:05:35.917 --> 00:05:37.167
-I'm Jude.

124
00:05:37.208 --> 00:05:38.625
-Craig Gerard.
nice to meet you.

125
00:05:38.708 --> 00:05:41.000
This is my wife. Sarah.
my daughter. Regan.

126
00:05:41.083 --> 00:05:45.083
We just had a little scare
with an aggressive driver.

127
00:05:45.083 --> 00:05:48.583
-It wasn't just a little scare.
It was serious road rage.

128
00:05:48.667 --> 00:05:50.042
-I'm sorry about that.

129
00:05:50.167 --> 00:05:53.375
-I'm sorry. are you with the
forest service or something?

130
00:05:53.458 --> 00:05:54.958
-Yes ma'am.

131
00:05:55.042 --> 00:05:56.458
-You look a little young.

132
00:05:56.542 --> 00:05:58.333
-Mom! You can't
just say that.

133
00:05:58.458 --> 00:05:59.958
-[chuckles] No. no. no.
It's okay.

134
00:06:00.042 --> 00:06:01.458
I admit I'm a trainee ranger.

135
00:06:01.542 --> 00:06:03.083
but I can take a report on
that driver if you'd like.

136
00:06:03.167 --> 00:06:04.167
-Yes! Yes. we would...

137
00:06:04.208 --> 00:06:05.750
-Oh. no.
No. no. no.

138
00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:08.542
We don't want this to cast a
cloud over our first day here.

139
00:06:08.667 --> 00:06:10.542
-Well. I promise most folks
around here

140
00:06:10.667 --> 00:06:15.333
are pretty easy going.
Not road-ragey at all.

141
00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:16.667
Where y'all from?

142
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:17.667
-Uh... New York.

143
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:18.917
-Oh. you're staying up
at the resort?

144
00:06:19.042 --> 00:06:20.083
-Yeah.

145
00:06:20.167 --> 00:06:21.292
-Sorry. are we free to go now?

146
00:06:21.375 --> 00:06:22.750
-Of course.

147
00:06:22.833 --> 00:06:25.333
I apologize for taking up
your time.

148
00:06:25.417 --> 00:06:27.000
Enjoy your time in
the Big Sky State.

149
00:06:29.667 --> 00:06:31.083
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

150
00:06:33.542 --> 00:06:34.875
-He's just asking us questions.

151
00:06:39.708 --> 00:06:42.042
-Mom!
That was so rude of you.

152
00:06:42.125 --> 00:06:44.917
-It seemed odd.
Didn't it?

153
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.375
Why was he asking
where we were staying?

154
00:06:47.458 --> 00:06:48.542
-I'm sure he was just
keeping tabs

155
00:06:48.542 --> 00:06:50.458
on the tourists in the area.

156
00:06:50.542 --> 00:06:52.333
-And you're one to talk about
interrogating people.

157
00:06:52.417 --> 00:06:53.833
Miss investigative reporter.

158
00:06:53.917 --> 00:06:57.833
-Alright. alright.
I'll... let it go.

159
00:06:57.875 --> 00:07:00.333
-And you just thought
he was cute.

160
00:07:00.417 --> 00:07:01.833
-[scoffs]
Come on. Dad.

161
00:07:03.875 --> 00:07:06.792
[peaceful music]

162
00:07:27.208 --> 00:07:28.333
-[Regan] Wow.

163
00:07:28.417 --> 00:07:29.375
-[Craig laughs]
That's the reaction.

164
00:07:29.458 --> 00:07:30.375
Pretty cool. huh?

165
00:07:30.458 --> 00:07:31.458
-Yeah. You did good. Craig.

166
00:07:31.542 --> 00:07:32.875
-Oh. thank you.

167
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.417
I guess you were right.

168
00:07:34.542 --> 00:07:37.083
one last family vacation
wasn't such a bad idea. Huh?

169
00:07:37.167 --> 00:07:38.125
-[chuckles]

170
00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:39.667
-Let's go in. Come on.

171
00:07:43.333 --> 00:07:45.000
-[Sarah] Oh.

172
00:07:45.083 --> 00:07:47.792
-[Craig chuckles]
-[Sarah] Wow. this is so nice.

173
00:07:47.875 --> 00:07:49.125
-[Regan] Are those antlers real?

174
00:07:49.208 --> 00:07:50.625
-Yup.

175
00:07:50.708 --> 00:07:52.708
Wow.

176
00:07:52.792 --> 00:07:56.333
-Well. well. well.
If it ain't Craig Gerard!

177
00:07:56.417 --> 00:07:59.917
-[chuckles]
-Oh... Jackson Green!

178
00:08:00.042 --> 00:08:01.833
Oh. it has been a while.
Hasn't it?

179
00:08:01.917 --> 00:08:03.583
-Yeah.
-Wow.

180
00:08:03.708 --> 00:08:05.875
-College. right?
About 20 years ago.

181
00:08:05.875 --> 00:08:08.667
-Yeah.
-Jeez.

182
00:08:08.708 --> 00:08:10.042
This is my wife. Sarah.

183
00:08:10.125 --> 00:08:10.750
-Hi.
-Sarah.

184
00:08:10.875 --> 00:08:12.208
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

185
00:08:12.292 --> 00:08:13.333
-And my daughter. Regan.

186
00:08:13.375 --> 00:08:15.208
-Regan. hey.
-Hey.

187
00:08:15.292 --> 00:08:17.542
-Yeah. the trouble this guy used
to get me into. right Craig?

188
00:08:17.625 --> 00:08:18.917
-[laughs]
-Oh. really?

189
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.458
I think it was the other way
around actually.

190
00:08:20.542 --> 00:08:21.958
-I don't know about that.

191
00:08:22.042 --> 00:08:23.417
So. what brings you out
to these parts. huh?

192
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:24.833
-We have some clientele

193
00:08:24.875 --> 00:08:26.833
that have been raving
about this lodge

194
00:08:26.917 --> 00:08:28.750
and the surrounding
national park.

195
00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:29.792
-Mm-hmm.

196
00:08:29.875 --> 00:08:31.167
-Your family was
from these parts. right?

197
00:08:31.167 --> 00:08:32.333
-Yup.

198
00:08:32.458 --> 00:08:34.167
-So is this place yours?

199
00:08:34.292 --> 00:08:35.958
-Uh... yes it is.

200
00:08:36.042 --> 00:08:37.250
-Oh my God.

201
00:08:37.333 --> 00:08:38.458
[both chuckle]

202
00:08:38.542 --> 00:08:39.667
What a small world.

203
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:40.875
-But hey. listen.

204
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.583
Uh... we got a lot of catching
up to do. right?

205
00:08:42.667 --> 00:08:45.333
So... why don't you all get
settled. and then Craig...

206
00:08:45.375 --> 00:08:46.500
we should have a drink.

207
00:08:46.583 --> 00:08:48.000
-Alright. I look forward to it.

208
00:08:48.042 --> 00:08:49.250
-Okay. Me too.

209
00:08:49.333 --> 00:08:51.083
Okay. Uh. go right that way
and they'll help you.

210
00:08:51.167 --> 00:08:52.708
-Thank you.
-Okay.

211
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.042
-It's so quiet here.

212
00:09:03.125 --> 00:09:05.750
-You're gonna sleep like a baby
tonight with no traffic noise.

213
00:09:08.208 --> 00:09:11.167
-Kinda seems like he knew
we were coming.

214
00:09:11.208 --> 00:09:11.958
-Hmm?

215
00:09:13.083 --> 00:09:16.250
-This isn't part of some
elaborate surprise. is it?

216
00:09:16.375 --> 00:09:18.042
You know how much
I hate surprises.

217
00:09:18.125 --> 00:09:21.667
-No surprises.
Just some weird coincidence.

218
00:09:24.208 --> 00:09:27.083
-Oh...

219
00:09:27.167 --> 00:09:30.125
Looks like my purchase already
came in handy.

220
00:09:30.208 --> 00:09:32.083
-Oh... nice one. Mom.

221
00:09:32.167 --> 00:09:33.083
-Thank you.

222
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.333
-You know what?

223
00:09:35.375 --> 00:09:37.500
I'm gonna take Jackson up
on the offer for the drinks.

224
00:09:37.542 --> 00:09:40.250
so if you two ladies don't mind
me ducking out?

225
00:09:40.375 --> 00:09:41.125
-No.

226
00:09:42.042 --> 00:09:43.667
-Why don't you two
go check out the spa?

227
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:44.792
-Ooh. there's a spa?

228
00:09:44.875 --> 00:09:46.458
-Yeah.

229
00:09:46.542 --> 00:09:48.458
-Oh.
That could be a good idea.

230
00:09:48.542 --> 00:09:50.958
We could get facials
or massages.

231
00:09:52.375 --> 00:09:54.167
-You know. actually
I'm good here.

232
00:10:05.417 --> 00:10:08.625
-I was surprised to see your
name pop up on the reservations.

233
00:10:10.792 --> 00:10:12.667
How long have I been trying
to get you come out here?

234
00:10:12.708 --> 00:10:14.417
-[chuckles]
-A while.

235
00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:15.417
-Yeah. well...

236
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.250
[glasses clink]

237
00:10:17.208 --> 00:10:18.583
[both chuckle]

238
00:10:20.792 --> 00:10:22.917
-Oh yeah. that's the good stuff.

239
00:10:24.375 --> 00:10:25.958
Oh...

240
00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:30.000
-Jackson. I wanted to talk
to you about our arrangement.

241
00:10:32.542 --> 00:10:35.125
-Oh. so that's why you didn't
tell me you were coming.

242
00:10:35.125 --> 00:10:39.250
-Well. I wanted to have this
conversation face to face.

243
00:10:39.333 --> 00:10:41.500
I think. uh...

244
00:10:41.542 --> 00:10:43.708
our arrangement has run
its course.

245
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:48.667
-Well things are going well
at the store. aren't they?

246
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:51.167
-Your infusion of cash
got me back on my feet

247
00:10:51.292 --> 00:10:52.458
when I needed it.

248
00:10:52.542 --> 00:10:53.458
-And my advice.

249
00:10:53.542 --> 00:10:55.000
-True. Um...

250
00:10:55.042 --> 00:10:56.500
-Right?

251
00:10:56.583 --> 00:10:59.542
-Expanding the outdoor sporting
gear to include hunting supplies

252
00:10:59.625 --> 00:11:03.125
has. uh. proven more lucrative
than I expected.

253
00:11:03.208 --> 00:11:04.708
-Inside every man
there's a little boy

254
00:11:04.792 --> 00:11:06.375
who used to play cowboys.

255
00:11:06.458 --> 00:11:08.333
even those fancy
Wall Street traders.

256
00:11:08.417 --> 00:11:09.958
-Yeah. I suppose so.

257
00:11:10.042 --> 00:11:11.333
-Yeah. and since you started
referring them here.

258
00:11:11.458 --> 00:11:13.000
they can play for real.
Right?

259
00:11:13.083 --> 00:11:14.458
You give Â´em the tools. I give
Â´em the four-star service

260
00:11:14.542 --> 00:11:15.958
they're accustomed to.

261
00:11:16.042 --> 00:11:17.958
combined with the wilderness
experience they crave.

262
00:11:18.042 --> 00:11:19.917
That's right.
[chuckles]

263
00:11:20.042 --> 00:11:21.708
-I know the sales pitch.
Jackson.

264
00:11:21.792 --> 00:11:25.500
I. um... I just...

265
00:11:25.583 --> 00:11:27.958
I don't think I'm the right
business partner for you.

266
00:11:29.167 --> 00:11:32.917
-Well. I mean...
you know. I get that.

267
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.708
You know. things change.
Right?

268
00:11:38.875 --> 00:11:40.542
I mean. we're a long ways
away from college

269
00:11:40.625 --> 00:11:43.000
when you and I were
thick as thieves. Right?

270
00:11:45.042 --> 00:11:47.667
But you know. out of
all our college crew...

271
00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:51.667
I never thought you and I would
lose touch like we did.

272
00:11:53.792 --> 00:11:56.917
-Well that wasn't on purpose.
you know.

273
00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.417
After what happened
senior year...

274
00:11:58.542 --> 00:11:59.583
-Water under the bridge.

275
00:11:59.667 --> 00:12:00.417
[clears throat]

276
00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:06.000
-Anyway... life happened.

277
00:12:06.083 --> 00:12:08.500
I had to take over
my father's store.

278
00:12:08.583 --> 00:12:09.667
Then I met Sarah.

279
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:10.875
-Yeah.

280
00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.458
-You know. time goes by.

281
00:12:12.542 --> 00:12:14.083
-It sure does.

282
00:12:15.125 --> 00:12:17.417
I understand.

283
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.958
-I'm glad that we got to connect
at the reunion...

284
00:12:21.083 --> 00:12:23.625
because look what it's brought.

285
00:12:23.625 --> 00:12:26.542
A very beneficial relationship.

286
00:12:26.625 --> 00:12:29.250
-That's run its course.

287
00:12:29.333 --> 00:12:32.208
-It doesn't mean we have
to become strangers again.

288
00:12:34.583 --> 00:12:38.750
-So your wife. she...

289
00:12:38.833 --> 00:12:42.125
she doesn't know about our.
uh... arrangement?

290
00:12:45.083 --> 00:12:47.042
-I didn't see any need
to worry her.

291
00:12:47.042 --> 00:12:48.958
-Yeah. Well. I can
understand that.

292
00:12:49.042 --> 00:12:52.542
We men have to protect
our families. right?

293
00:12:52.667 --> 00:12:58.083
So. if you don't want Sarah to
know. then... mum's the word.

294
00:13:00.125 --> 00:13:01.500
-Thank you.

295
00:13:01.583 --> 00:13:03.458
-Yeah. of course.
Of course.

296
00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.833
I'm wondering if maybe
you could do.

297
00:13:07.875 --> 00:13:09.875
well. a small favor
for me in return.

298
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.292
-What is it?

299
00:13:13.375 --> 00:13:15.833
-Just a little delivery to
an important associate of mine.

300
00:13:18.125 --> 00:13:20.000
I'm having dinner
with the mayor tonight.

301
00:13:20.083 --> 00:13:23.208
-Oh.
-And I... can't take it myself.

302
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.917
-So could you do that for me.
Craig?

303
00:13:27.042 --> 00:13:29.000
Just one last thing
so we can. uh...

304
00:13:30.083 --> 00:13:32.375
[paper rips]
...part on good terms?

305
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:33.958
-Of course.

306
00:14:03.625 --> 00:14:06.542
[birds chirping]

307
00:14:13.708 --> 00:14:15.792
-So how's Jackson?

308
00:14:15.875 --> 00:14:17.583
-Huh?

309
00:14:17.667 --> 00:14:19.458
How's Jackson?

310
00:14:19.542 --> 00:14:20.958
Jackson's fine.

311
00:14:23.833 --> 00:14:25.500
-Just catching up on old times?

312
00:14:26.875 --> 00:14:29.833
-Well. yes.
It's been a while.

313
00:14:32.875 --> 00:14:35.625
-Alright. I'm gonna go to bed.

314
00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:37.333
-Oh. thank God.

315
00:14:37.333 --> 00:14:40.167
I didn't wanna be the first
to give in.

316
00:14:40.208 --> 00:14:44.708
But since you displayed
weakness. my only child. go!

317
00:14:44.792 --> 00:14:46.167
-Okay.

318
00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:47.042
[both chuckle]

319
00:14:47.125 --> 00:14:48.750
-Goodnight sweetheart.
-Mm-hmm.

320
00:14:48.833 --> 00:14:49.917
-Goodnight kiddo.

321
00:14:51.125 --> 00:14:52.917
-Goodnight old-timers.

322
00:14:56.292 --> 00:14:57.042
[door shuts]

323
00:14:58.375 --> 00:15:00.125
-What aren't you telling me.
Craig?

324
00:15:02.625 --> 00:15:03.542
-About what?

325
00:15:05.167 --> 00:15:06.667
-[Sarah] What are we really
doing here?

326
00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:09.458
-[Craig] Nothing.

327
00:15:09.542 --> 00:15:10.792
-[Sarah] Don't you think
it's a little weird?

328
00:15:10.875 --> 00:15:12.125
-[Craig] Yes!

329
00:15:12.208 --> 00:15:13.417
We haven't seen each other
in a long time.

330
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.167
-[Sarah] I mean. it's kind of
a coincidence

331
00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:17.667
that we just run into your
buddy from college.

332
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.000
-[Craig] Good coincidence.

333
00:15:19.042 --> 00:15:20.417
-[Sarah ]There's something else
going on.

334
00:15:31.875 --> 00:15:33.958
[crickets chirping]

335
00:15:59.708 --> 00:16:00.458
-Are you following me?

336
00:16:00.542 --> 00:16:01.708
-No! No. no.

337
00:16:01.792 --> 00:16:03.417
I didn't mean to scare you.
I swear.

338
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.625
I'm... I'm Tyler.

339
00:16:05.708 --> 00:16:06.958
-You work here?

340
00:16:07.042 --> 00:16:10.042
-Yeah. Which means I...
I live here too.

341
00:16:10.125 --> 00:16:12.000
At least for the season.

342
00:16:12.083 --> 00:16:13.417
I lead group hikes all day

343
00:16:13.542 --> 00:16:16.333
so that's why I like coming out
here after my shift.

344
00:16:16.417 --> 00:16:18.583
-Well. sorry for interrupting
your solitude.

345
00:16:18.708 --> 00:16:21.958
-Sorry for walking in
a menacing fashion.

346
00:16:22.042 --> 00:16:23.333
[both chuckle]

347
00:16:24.583 --> 00:16:26.000
-I'm Regan.

348
00:16:26.083 --> 00:16:28.000
-Nice to meet you. Regan.

349
00:16:28.042 --> 00:16:30.583
-It's awesome
that you live here.

350
00:16:30.708 --> 00:16:33.500
-Yeah. It's pretty great.

351
00:16:33.583 --> 00:16:35.833
Are you camping out?

352
00:16:35.875 --> 00:16:39.542
-Uh... yeah. I thought
I'd give it a go.

353
00:16:39.625 --> 00:16:43.000
-City girl wanted a night
under the stars. huh?

354
00:16:43.042 --> 00:16:44.542
-How'd you know
I was a city girl?

355
00:16:44.625 --> 00:16:46.667
-Uh... just a hunch.

356
00:16:46.708 --> 00:16:48.083
[laughs]

357
00:16:48.208 --> 00:16:49.417
-Well it's impossible

358
00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.000
to see the stars like this
in New York City.

359
00:16:52.083 --> 00:16:55.000
-Oh! The big city.

360
00:16:55.125 --> 00:16:57.500
-[chuckles]
Yeah. so they say.

361
00:16:57.583 --> 00:16:59.917
-I could show you a camping spot
if you want.

362
00:16:59.917 --> 00:17:00.708
-Really?

363
00:17:00.792 --> 00:17:01.792
-Yeah.

364
00:17:01.875 --> 00:17:03.125
-Yeah. that'd be great.

365
00:17:04.375 --> 00:17:05.625
-See the creek?

366
00:17:06.708 --> 00:17:09.667
So you. uh. follow that north
about 50 yards.

367
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:13.000
There's a little clearing.
I've camped there myself.

368
00:17:13.042 --> 00:17:15.083
You can't miss it.

369
00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:16.625
-Sounds great. thanks.

370
00:17:18.125 --> 00:17:21.292
-Yeah. See you around.
city girl.

371
00:17:21.375 --> 00:17:23.083
-[chuckles]
Yeah. alright.

372
00:17:49.875 --> 00:17:51.792
-What are you doing?

373
00:17:51.792 --> 00:17:53.750
-[sighs]
Just out for a walk.

374
00:17:58.708 --> 00:18:00.583
-It's the middle of the night.

375
00:18:00.667 --> 00:18:02.125
-I couldn't sleep.

376
00:18:03.125 --> 00:18:06.292
-You could sleep through
an earthquake.

377
00:18:06.375 --> 00:18:07.792
[sighs]

378
00:18:15.417 --> 00:18:19.458
I thought we were really
gonna try on this trip.

379
00:18:19.542 --> 00:18:22.042
That means you have
to talk to me.

380
00:18:22.167 --> 00:18:25.042
-I understand that
but this isn't about us.

381
00:18:25.125 --> 00:18:26.792
-Well. what's it about?

382
00:18:28.042 --> 00:18:30.667
-I have to do a... a favor
for Jackson.

383
00:18:31.917 --> 00:18:32.792
-Jackson?

384
00:18:34.417 --> 00:18:37.333
The owner of this lodge who
you haven't seen since college.

385
00:18:37.375 --> 00:18:39.625
who I've never met
until today?

386
00:18:41.542 --> 00:18:43.167
Oh. I see.

387
00:18:46.875 --> 00:18:49.333
This is about business.
Isn't it?

388
00:18:49.375 --> 00:18:50.875
-God...

389
00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:54.458
-You wanted me to think that you
found this place on your own.

390
00:18:54.542 --> 00:18:57.042
Some place that I would love.
some place that...

391
00:18:57.125 --> 00:18:58.500
that would be good for us.

392
00:18:58.625 --> 00:19:03.708
But this is just a place where
you could get a good deal.

393
00:19:03.792 --> 00:19:06.750
Or do some new deal.

394
00:19:06.833 --> 00:19:08.167
-It's not that.

395
00:19:10.833 --> 00:19:12.625
-This trip was never about us.

396
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.667
-Sarah. I'm here for you.

397
00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:20.292
What does it matter
how I found the place

398
00:19:20.375 --> 00:19:22.250
or if I know the owner?

399
00:19:22.333 --> 00:19:24.042
-Because you lied about it.

400
00:19:24.125 --> 00:19:25.542
-Really?

401
00:19:26.333 --> 00:19:28.833
Well I didn't mean to.

402
00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:30.583
I was embarrassed. okay?

403
00:19:32.167 --> 00:19:33.292
I mean. look at the place.

404
00:19:33.292 --> 00:19:34.792
I could never compete
with Jackson.

405
00:19:36.792 --> 00:19:38.125
-[sighs]

406
00:19:43.458 --> 00:19:45.833
So... what's this
mysterious favor?

407
00:19:45.875 --> 00:19:49.250
-I have to deliver some
documents to a colleague.

408
00:19:49.333 --> 00:19:50.917
-Doesn't he have staff for that?

409
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.125
-I don't know.
I didn't ask.

410
00:19:53.208 --> 00:19:55.000
-And you decided to make
this delivery

411
00:19:55.042 --> 00:19:57.375
in the middle of the night.

412
00:19:57.458 --> 00:19:59.792
When you knew that you could
keep it a secret from me.

413
00:19:59.875 --> 00:20:01.208
Got it.

414
00:20:01.292 --> 00:20:02.958
-Sarah. this doesn't have
to ruin anything.

415
00:20:03.042 --> 00:20:05.167
It's a quick errand.

416
00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:07.583
-But I don't understand
why he needs you to do it.

417
00:20:07.667 --> 00:20:10.667
-Maybe you don't need
to understand!

418
00:20:10.708 --> 00:20:12.000
You don't have the right

419
00:20:12.042 --> 00:20:13.875
to every detail of other
people's lives.

420
00:20:13.958 --> 00:20:15.250
-I never said I did.

421
00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:19.583
-Yet you look at everything.
I mean everything.

422
00:20:19.708 --> 00:20:22.167
like it's a news story
you need to uncover.

423
00:20:25.083 --> 00:20:26.167
-Fine.

424
00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:28.333
He's your friend.
you trust him.

425
00:20:28.417 --> 00:20:30.250
I will not ask any
more questions.

426
00:20:30.375 --> 00:20:31.583
-Thank you.

427
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.625
-But I'm coming with you.

428
00:20:34.708 --> 00:20:35.667
-No. Sarah...

429
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:37.208
-What?

430
00:20:37.292 --> 00:20:38.833
We're supposed to be spending
time together.

431
00:20:38.917 --> 00:20:40.542
-[sighs]

432
00:20:40.667 --> 00:20:43.583
-So... we can do a little
stargazing.

433
00:20:44.542 --> 00:20:45.875
-[laughs]

434
00:20:47.667 --> 00:20:49.250
Stargaze?

435
00:20:49.333 --> 00:20:50.750
-I'll go get dressed.

436
00:20:51.958 --> 00:20:54.833

[thunder rumbles]

439
00:21:19.708 --> 00:21:23.167
This. uh. colleague of Jackson's
sure lives off the beaten path.

440
00:21:23.333 --> 00:21:25.042
-I guess that's why
he didn't have time

441
00:21:25.125 --> 00:21:28.500
to come out here himself.

442
00:21:28.542 --> 00:21:29.625
-Right.

443
00:21:35.167 --> 00:21:37.417
Well. my signal's totally dead.

444
00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.583
-I have a couple bars.
don't worry.

445
00:21:40.667 --> 00:21:44.875
According to the directions.
the turn out is right ahead.

446
00:21:54.042 --> 00:21:56.042
-This can't be the place.

447
00:21:56.167 --> 00:21:57.458
-Must be.

448
00:21:59.542 --> 00:22:01.625
You just wait here.
I'll only be a minute.

449
00:22:17.917 --> 00:22:20.375
-Who the hell are you?

450
00:22:20.375 --> 00:22:23.958
-Uh... Jackson said you'd be
expecting a delivery.

451
00:22:24.042 --> 00:22:26.292
-Okay then. Give it here.

452
00:22:32.208 --> 00:22:35.292
[dramatic music]

453
00:22:46.125 --> 00:22:47.792
-What the hell?

454
00:22:54.208 --> 00:22:57.458
-He also said you might have
something to send back to him?

455
00:22:59.042 --> 00:23:00.750
-Hold on a minute.

456
00:23:06.042 --> 00:23:07.542
Why don't you step inside?

457
00:23:07.625 --> 00:23:10.083
I'll write a quick note.
take it back with you.

458
00:23:10.875 --> 00:23:11.625
-Uh...

459
00:23:12.583 --> 00:23:13.667
-Craig.

460
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:14.625
-Okay.

461
00:23:16.375 --> 00:23:18.083
-Craig!

463

-[screams]
No!

464
00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:26.000
-Do as I say or
I'll slice his throat

465
00:23:26.083 --> 00:23:28.292
before you take another step.

466
00:23:28.375 --> 00:23:30.875
Step towards me.

467
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.333
-Okay.
-Nice and slow.

468
00:23:33.375 --> 00:23:35.167
-[grunts]
-We don't want any trouble.

469
00:23:35.208 --> 00:23:38.667
Call Jackson. this is just
a big misunderstanding.

470
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:40.000
-Shut up.

471
00:23:40.042 --> 00:23:43.833
-Please. we promise not
to say anything to anybody.

472
00:23:43.875 --> 00:23:45.625
-I just told you to keep
your mouth shut

473
00:23:45.708 --> 00:23:47.125
and you're still talking.

474
00:23:47.208 --> 00:23:48.042
-I... I just...

476
00:24:01.833 --> 00:24:02.542
-Craig.

477

Craig.

478
00:24:05.208 --> 00:24:06.333
Craig!

479
00:24:06.417 --> 00:24:07.458
Wake up!

480
00:24:08.792 --> 00:24:09.667

Oh come on. come on.
come on.

484
00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.125
-I need to see you right now.

485
00:24:44.625 --> 00:24:46.125
You know the place.

[car door slams shut]

488
00:25:00.292 --> 00:25:03.458
-You do not call me unless
it's absolutely critical.

489
00:25:03.542 --> 00:25:09.167
-I know the damn rules.
Another one. no surprises.

490
00:25:09.208 --> 00:25:10.458
-Oh. come on.

491
00:25:10.542 --> 00:25:11.500
Don't tell me you couldn't
handle Craig.

492
00:25:11.625 --> 00:25:13.333
-Handling him
would've been fine.

493
00:25:13.417 --> 00:25:15.917
It's when his old lady
come screeching up.

494
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.125
things took a turn.

495
00:25:19.833 --> 00:25:21.625
-Well. that's unfortunate.

496
00:25:21.708 --> 00:25:24.417
-Unfortunate for you.

497
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:25.500
-Excuse me?

498
00:25:25.542 --> 00:25:27.750
-These are special
circumstances.

499
00:25:27.833 --> 00:25:29.583
I've never killed
a woman before.

500
00:25:29.708 --> 00:25:31.292
-Oh. come on.
Don't get principled on me now.

501
00:25:31.417 --> 00:25:33.333
-It's not a matter of principle.

502
00:25:33.458 --> 00:25:35.333
It's about price.

503
00:25:35.375 --> 00:25:37.542
-Okay. Alright.

504
00:25:37.625 --> 00:25:38.792
-I'm thinking double.

505
00:25:38.875 --> 00:25:40.083
-Oh. come on.
Now listen...

506
00:25:40.208 --> 00:25:41.583
-No. you listen to me.

507
00:25:41.667 --> 00:25:45.000
For once. I figure I got
the upper hand.

508
00:25:45.083 --> 00:25:49.167
If this whole setup goes south.
I can disappear.

509
00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:53.375
But you?
You got a lot to lose.

510

00:30:12.833 --> 00:30:14.083
Oh my God. you're awake.

538
00:30:35.292 --> 00:30:37.500
-Okay. pretend like you're
unconscious. Okay?

539
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:38.333
-Okay.

540
00:30:46.375 --> 00:30:47.792
-Who's Regan?

541
00:30:49.042 --> 00:30:53.958
-Regan is our daughter.
She's in New York.

542
00:30:54.042 --> 00:30:55.958
She's probably just checking in.

543
00:30:59.167 --> 00:31:02.250
-Well I guess little girl's
gonna have to get by on her own.

544
00:31:02.375 --> 00:31:03.333
[thud]

545
00:31:13.083 --> 00:31:15.750
-Hi. Um. were there any messages
left for me today?

546
00:31:15.833 --> 00:31:17.042
Regan Gerard.

547
00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:20.500
-Sorry. I don't see anything.

548
00:31:20.542 --> 00:31:22.000
-Um... okay.

549
00:31:22.083 --> 00:31:23.833
Were there any morning
activities or anything like that

550
00:31:23.875 --> 00:31:26.292
charged to our room?
Cabin 32.

551

[keyboard clacks]

552
00:31:30.042 --> 00:31:32.250
-I'm not seeing anything.

553
00:31:32.333 --> 00:31:34.417
Um... did you wanna
book anything?

554
00:31:34.542 --> 00:31:36.542
We have mountain bikes for rent.

555
00:31:36.667 --> 00:31:38.625
-Uh. no. That's... no.
that's okay.

556
00:31:38.708 --> 00:31:42.667
Um... just one last question.

557
00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:44.000
Have you seen either
of these people

558
00:31:44.083 --> 00:31:45.792
come through the lodge
at all today?

559
00:31:45.792 --> 00:31:48.833
-Sorry. No. not today.

560
00:31:48.958 --> 00:31:50.875
-Okay. uh... thanks.

561
00:32:03.708 --> 00:32:04.958
-[sighs]

562
00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:08.125
Dammit.

563
00:32:08.208 --> 00:32:09.000
-What?

564
00:32:09.083 --> 00:32:10.250
-He locked the door.

565
00:32:10.375 --> 00:32:12.167
I got outside last night
but he locked it.

566
00:32:13.792 --> 00:32:16.042
-Oh my God. What have I
got us into?

567
00:32:16.042 --> 00:32:17.542
-Do you remember that story.

568
00:32:17.625 --> 00:32:20.000
that story that I covered in
Asia about the tiger poaching?

569
00:32:20.042 --> 00:32:22.042
These are the same tools.

570
00:32:22.125 --> 00:32:23.625
These are the same tools
poachers use

571
00:32:23.708 --> 00:32:25.500
to work the animal hides.

572
00:32:25.583 --> 00:32:28.708
And. and... these cages.
and the ones outside...

573
00:32:28.792 --> 00:32:29.833
-I saw those too.

574
00:32:29.875 --> 00:32:31.417
-Yeah.

575
00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:34.333
That envelope you delivered.
it was full of client info.

576
00:32:34.417 --> 00:32:38.167
All hard copies. no electronic
records. Okay?

577
00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:40.417
Your... your friend Jackson
is a poacher

578
00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:43.333
and that client list was a list
of all these rich people

579
00:32:43.458 --> 00:32:46.000
that wanna hunt
endangered animals.

00:32:46.042 --> 00:32:48.292
Probably. I don't know.
wolves in this area.

581
00:32:48.375 --> 00:32:50.167
And this lunatic
is the same guy

582
00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:52.000
that ran us off the road
yesterday.

583
00:32:52.125 --> 00:32:54.958
-I can't believe this is
happening to us.

584
00:32:55.042 --> 00:32:59.958
-I need you to not panic
right now. Okay?

585
00:33:00.042 --> 00:33:03.125
-Sarah. I can't believe Jackson
would try and...

586
00:33:03.208 --> 00:33:05.500
-I don't give a crap
about Jackson right now.

587
00:33:05.583 --> 00:33:07.875
You need to focus on
getting out of here

588
00:33:07.958 --> 00:33:09.667
so we can get to our daughter
before they do.

589
00:33:09.792 --> 00:33:11.167
Do you understand?

590
00:33:11.208 --> 00:33:13.750
-Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay.

591
00:33:13.833 --> 00:33:14.667
-[sighs]

592
00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.750
-[voicemail] Hi. this is Sarah.
You know what to do.

593
00:33:31.833 --> 00:33:32.833
-[sighs] God.

594
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.250
Okay. you guys have been
gone for hours.

595
00:33:34.333 --> 00:33:36.083
If you're trying to teach me
some kind of lesson

596
00:33:36.167 --> 00:33:38.375
by disappearing all day.
it's not funny.

597
00:33:38.458 --> 00:33:41.125
Can you call me back?
Please? Now.

598
00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:59.667
Hi. Um...
I wanted to check

599
00:33:59.708 --> 00:34:02.708
if there were any car accidents
that happened last night

600
00:34:02.792 --> 00:34:06.583
or any man or woman
that might've been admitted

601
00:34:06.708 --> 00:34:08.208
to the hospital today.

602
00:34:12.958 --> 00:34:15.667
No. Okay.

603
00:34:16.917 --> 00:34:20.833
And there's nobody there by
the name of Craig Gerard or...

604
00:34:20.875 --> 00:34:22.250
or Sarah Gerard?

605
00:34:28.792 --> 00:34:30.542
Okay. Thank you.

606
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:38.875
-Hello again.

607
00:34:38.958 --> 00:34:40.417
-Uh. still no messages for me?

608
00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:42.458
-No. sorry.

609
00:34:42.542 --> 00:34:44.708
-Can I rent one of those
bicycles that you mentioned?

610
00:34:44.792 --> 00:34:46.292
-Of course. Miss Gerard.

611
00:34:51.417 --> 00:34:53.250
-You need to see to our guests'

612
00:34:53.333 --> 00:34:56.167

immediately.

615

Get a grip. Regan.

616
00:35:48.417 --> 00:35:49.292
Okay.

617
00:36:01.292 --> 00:36:04.667
-Hello young lady.
How can I help you?

618
00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:06.833
-Do rangers help when people
are missing?

619
00:36:08.542 --> 00:36:10.667
-You know someone who's gone
missing in the forest?

620
00:36:10.708 --> 00:36:12.042
-Maybe.

621
00:36:12.125 --> 00:36:13.208
I'm staying with my parents
at the resort

622
00:36:13.333 --> 00:36:15.333
and they've been gone
all morning.

623
00:36:15.333 --> 00:36:16.708
[door squeaks]

624
00:36:17.583 --> 00:36:21.000
-Hi. The girl who battled
road rage.

625
00:36:21.083 --> 00:36:22.833
Regan. right?

626
00:36:22.875 --> 00:36:23.875
-Yeah. right.

627
00:36:26.208 --> 00:36:29.042
-She says her parents
might be missing.

628
00:36:29.167 --> 00:36:30.500
-Oh. what happened?

629
00:36:31.875 --> 00:36:33.333
-I don't know.

630
00:36:33.458 --> 00:36:34.625
They weren't in the cabin
when I got back this morning

631
00:36:34.708 --> 00:36:36.667
and they're not answering
their phones.

632
00:36:36.708 --> 00:36:38.500
No calls. texts.

633
00:36:38.583 --> 00:36:42.542
-What time did you notice
them gone?

634
00:36:42.667 --> 00:36:44.625
-Around 7:00 AM.

635
00:36:44.708 --> 00:36:46.458
-And where were you
before that?

636
00:36:46.542 --> 00:36:48.167
-I camped out last night.

637
00:36:48.292 --> 00:36:50.500
-Alone?

638
00:36:50.625 --> 00:36:51.375
-Yes.

639
00:36:52.708 --> 00:36:54.667
-Then don't you think
it's likely

640
00:36:54.792 --> 00:36:57.375
they're looking for you
right now?

641
00:36:57.458 --> 00:36:59.958
-Yeah. but they haven't
even tried to call me.

642
00:37:00.042 --> 00:37:02.667
I mean. my mom would never be
without her phone.

643
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:06.000
-I mean. maybe they've tried
calling because...

644
00:37:06.083 --> 00:37:08.833
reception out here
is pretty shoddy.

645
00:37:08.958 --> 00:37:10.167
-Yeah. it's not like them.

646
00:37:10.208 --> 00:37:12.292
They didn't leave a note
or anything. and...

647
00:37:12.375 --> 00:37:13.833
I don't know. I feel like
something's wrong.

648
00:37:13.875 --> 00:37:16.875
-Okay. Okay. Okay.

649
00:37:16.958 --> 00:37:20.000
I have a feeling your parents
will be back any moment.

650
00:37:20.042 --> 00:37:24.833
But if they're not. you call me.
I'll call the Sheriff

651
00:37:24.917 --> 00:37:28.000
and have a missing
person's report filed.

652
00:37:28.042 --> 00:37:30.542
-Maybe I can go up to the resort
and help her find her parents.

653
00:37:30.625 --> 00:37:32.708
-You've got work here.

654
00:37:32.792 --> 00:37:35.792
But I promise. we'll help
when the time comes.

655
00:37:37.292 --> 00:37:42.333
But... I bet your parents turn
up on their own any time now.

656
00:37:46.667 --> 00:37:49.833
-There has to be something sharp
enough that can cut this rope.

657
00:37:49.917 --> 00:37:52.958
-I know. I know.
I'm looking. I'm looking.

658
00:37:53.042 --> 00:37:55.375
I can't believe I left my knife
out there last night.

660
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:07.125

Wait.

664
00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:16.833
Wait a second. I...

665
00:38:16.875 --> 00:38:18.458
I saw a guy do this once
when we were in the bush.

666
00:38:18.542 --> 00:38:20.333
Maybe this will work.

[engine revving]

712
00:40:28.583 --> 00:40:29.708
-Sarah. watch out.

713
00:40:29.833 --> 00:40:31.083
-Oh my God!
He's getting on my side.

714
00:40:31.208 --> 00:40:32.250
-Don't let him get there!

715
00:40:32.333 --> 00:40:33.542
-I can't!

716
00:40:33.667 --> 00:40:34.875
-Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa!
-[tires squeal]

717
00:40:40.208 --> 00:40:41.333
-[panting]
-Are you okay?

718
00:40:41.375 --> 00:40:44.292
-Yeah. I think so.
How about you?

719
00:40:44.375 --> 00:40:45.667
-Yeah.

720
00:40:47.125 --> 00:40:48.208
I just... I...

721
00:40:48.375 --> 00:40:49.458
-Come on.

722
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.042
-Oh my God. we gotta go.

723
00:40:52.167 --> 00:40:55.000
-You think you know these
woods better than me?

724
00:40:55.708 --> 00:40:56.875
-He's got another arrow.
come on!

725
00:40:58.375 --> 00:40:59.333

726
00:40:59.375 --> 00:41:00.167
[both gasp]

727
00:41:02.583 --> 00:41:04.167
-Trees are thicker this way.
we can lose him.

728
00:41:04.292 --> 00:41:05.042
-Okay.

729
00:41:08.375 --> 00:41:09.250
-[arrow whistles]
-[thud]

730
00:41:09.333 --> 00:41:10.167
[screams]
Ahhhh!!!!

731
00:41:11.375 --> 00:41:13.500
Sarah. Sarah!

732
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.833
-Oh my God.

733
00:41:15.917 --> 00:41:16.958
Craig?

734
00:41:17.042 --> 00:41:19.042
Oh my God!
We have to keep going.

735
00:41:23.042 --> 00:41:25.917
[dramatic music]

736
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.167
-Hey! City girl.

737
00:41:33.208 --> 00:41:34.208
-Hey.

738
00:41:34.292 --> 00:41:35.875
-How'd that camping spot
work out?

739
00:41:35.958 --> 00:41:39.000
-Oh yeah. it was really pretty.
Thanks.

740
00:41:39.083 --> 00:41:40.542
-Is everything okay?

741
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.292
-I just... I can't seem
to find my parents.

742
00:41:45.375 --> 00:41:48.083
-Yeah. it's a big place.

743
00:41:48.167 --> 00:41:53.292
-No. it's not that. It's...
they've been gone all morning

744
00:41:53.292 --> 00:41:55.542
and they're not answering
any of my calls. and...

745
00:41:55.667 --> 00:41:57.125
I don't know what to do.

746
00:41:57.208 --> 00:41:59.167
-I'm sure they'll turn up.

747
00:41:59.208 --> 00:42:01.583
-Yeah. you sound exactly
like the rangers.

748
00:42:01.708 --> 00:42:03.292
-Wait. you talked
to the rangers?

749
00:42:03.375 --> 00:42:04.667
-Yeah. They told me to.
you know.

750
00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:07.667
keep waiting for them
to turn up but...

751
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:10.292
they wouldn't just disappear
on me like this and...

752
00:42:10.375 --> 00:42:13.500
trust me. you don't know
my mother.

753
00:42:13.625 --> 00:42:15.958
I'm really worried something
is wrong.

754
00:42:17.625 --> 00:42:19.917
And nobody will listen
to me. so...

755
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000
-I'm so sorry. I didn't know
it was that serious.

756
00:42:23.042 --> 00:42:24.917
-It's alright.
How could you know?

757
00:42:25.042 --> 00:42:27.792
-Hey. uh... it's gonna be
okay. Alright?

758
00:42:27.875 --> 00:42:30.167
Why don't we go talk
to my uncle?

759
00:42:30.208 --> 00:42:31.250
-Who's your uncle?

760
00:42:31.333 --> 00:42:32.625
-He owns the resort.

761
00:42:32.708 --> 00:42:33.917
-What. really?

762
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.167
-Yeah. He'll know what to do.

763
00:42:36.292 --> 00:42:37.417
Can I take your bike?

764
00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:39.250
-Uh... yeah. Thank you.

765
00:42:39.333 --> 00:42:40.917
-Yeah. no problem.

766
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.000
-Thanks.

767
00:42:43.708 --> 00:42:45.583
So. what do you think?

768
00:42:45.667 --> 00:42:47.792
-Hmm. What do I think?

769
00:42:47.875 --> 00:42:53.042
Well... I don't agree
with the rangers on much

770
00:42:53.167 --> 00:42:56.458
but. uh. I think they might
be right.

771
00:42:56.542 --> 00:42:57.792
And if I know your dad.

772
00:42:57.875 --> 00:42:59.083
I'm sure the moment he found out
you were gone

773
00:42:59.208 --> 00:43:01.417
he probably ran off
to try to find you.

774
00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:04.167
But unfortunately outsiders
bite off more than they can chew

775
00:43:04.292 --> 00:43:05.750
when it comes to the forest.

776
00:43:05.833 --> 00:43:07.083
They... you know.
they get turned around.

777
00:43:07.167 --> 00:43:08.625
they lose cell phone
reception. they...

778
00:43:08.708 --> 00:43:09.708
-Yeah. but it's been...

779
00:43:09.833 --> 00:43:11.250
-No. Uh. uh. uh...

780
00:43:11.333 --> 00:43:12.625
Let me finish.

781
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.875
Now having said that. it's
always better to worry sooner

782
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.333
and feel silly later than
to wait too long. Right?

783
00:43:21.417 --> 00:43:22.583
So here's what I'm gonna do.

784
00:43:22.708 --> 00:43:24.000
I'm gonna get those rangers
on the phone.

785
00:43:24.042 --> 00:43:26.042
and we're gonna get to the
bottom of this. Alright?

786
00:43:26.167 --> 00:43:27.708
I promise you that.

787
00:43:28.583 --> 00:43:29.583
-[sighs]
Thank you.

788
00:43:29.667 --> 00:43:31.042
Thank you so much.

789
00:43:31.958 --> 00:43:33.875
-Do you have the...
the card?

790
00:43:33.958 --> 00:43:36.292
-Uh...
-That. uh. he gave you?

791
00:43:36.375 --> 00:43:37.792
-Yes. Of course.

792
00:43:42.208 --> 00:43:42.958
-[sighs]

793
00:43:44.667 --> 00:43:47.458
Okay. So. uh. here's what's
gonna happen.

794
00:43:47.542 --> 00:43:50.875
Tyler's gonna stick with you
Â´till we sort this out. Okay?

795
00:43:50.958 --> 00:43:54.917
And if you need anything.
anything at all. he'll help.

796
00:43:57.167 --> 00:43:58.125
-Are you sure?

797
00:43:58.208 --> 00:43:59.208
-Of course.

798
00:44:00.958 --> 00:44:04.333
-Okay. Thank you both.

799
00:44:04.417 --> 00:44:07.208
-Of course.
Get outta here.

800
00:44:07.208 --> 00:44:08.333
Try and have some fun.

801
00:44:29.375 --> 00:44:32.625
[both breathing heavily]

802
00:44:32.708 --> 00:44:35.833
-I... I... I don't think I can
go much longer on this leg.

803
00:44:35.958 --> 00:44:38.458
-Okay. It's probably because
your adrenaline's wearing off.

804
00:44:38.542 --> 00:44:39.375
-[groans]

805
00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:40.667
-You gotta sit down.

806
00:44:40.792 --> 00:44:42.958
[panting]

807
00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:47.292
-[wincing]

808
00:44:47.375 --> 00:44:48.708
-Here. let me check it.

809
00:44:50.375 --> 00:44:53.500
It looks like it went
straight through.

810
00:44:53.667 --> 00:44:54.958
Doesn't look like it hit
an artery though.

811
00:44:55.042 --> 00:44:56.667
there'd be way more blood.

812
00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:58.500
-Are you gonna pull it out?

813
00:44:58.542 --> 00:45:00.958
-I don't want to. but... I don't
know how you're gonna...

814
00:45:01.042 --> 00:45:04.792
keep going with it sticking
straight out like that.

815
00:45:04.792 --> 00:45:07.292
-We have arrows like this
at the store.

816
00:45:07.375 --> 00:45:08.750
The tip is a screw-on.

817
00:45:08.833 --> 00:45:11.125
you can... you can
take it off.

818
00:45:11.208 --> 00:45:12.250
-Okay.

819
00:45:12.333 --> 00:45:13.333
-Just go slow.

820
00:45:13.417 --> 00:45:14.250
-Okay.
-Oh!

821
00:45:18.167 --> 00:45:19.208
-I got it.

822
00:45:20.125 --> 00:45:21.500
I'm gonna have to pull it out.

823
00:45:21.583 --> 00:45:22.417
-Alright.

824
00:45:26.875 --> 00:45:31.292
-I need something to...
I need something to put over it.

825
00:45:32.917 --> 00:45:37.000
Something to tighten it.
to cover it.

826
00:45:37.042 --> 00:45:39.167
I think if I come over here
I got a better angle.

827
00:45:39.208 --> 00:45:40.958
-[groaning]
Okay! Okay!

828
00:45:41.042 --> 00:45:42.083
Oh!

829
00:45:42.167 --> 00:45:44.250
-I'm sorry. Okay.
This is gonna hurt.

830
00:45:44.375 --> 00:45:45.000
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

831
00:45:45.042 --> 00:45:46.667
-One...
-Mm-hmm.

832
00:45:46.708 --> 00:45:49.833
-Two... three!
-[muffled screams]

833
00:45:49.875 --> 00:45:51.792
-Okay. Okay.

834
00:45:55.167 --> 00:45:58.875
I'm sorry.
I gotta tie this.

835
00:45:58.958 --> 00:46:00.042
-[exertion grunts]

836
00:46:03.625 --> 00:46:05.375
-It's gotta be tight.
-I know.

837
00:46:06.167 --> 00:46:07.167
-There.

838
00:46:07.208 --> 00:46:08.917
-[deep inhale]

839
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.667
-Okay. Now take
a deep breath.

840
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:14.208
-[breathing heavily]

841
00:46:17.958 --> 00:46:20.417
How far is the car
from here?

842
00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:22.792
-I don't know.
A few miles?

843
00:46:25.083 --> 00:46:29.875
-If we go back in that direction
we'll find the road. right?

844
00:46:29.958 --> 00:46:32.583
If he's not following us.

845
00:46:32.583 --> 00:46:33.500
-Yeah.

846
00:46:35.875 --> 00:46:37.458
-[branch cracks]
-What was that?

847
00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:40.375
-We gotta keep moving.
Come on.

848
00:46:40.458 --> 00:46:41.500
-Okay.
-Here we go.

849
00:46:43.208 --> 00:46:44.167
-Ahhh!!!

850
00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:45.875
[wincing]

851
00:46:48.417 --> 00:46:49.917
-Come on.

852
00:46:55.458 --> 00:46:57.708
-So... how long have you been
working for your uncle?

853
00:46:57.792 --> 00:46:59.667
-Several years. on and off.

854
00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:02.333
Summer breaks when I was in high
school and now it's full time.

855
00:47:02.375 --> 00:47:04.500
-Are you learning
the family business?

856
00:47:04.583 --> 00:47:07.708
-Actually. at first it was a way
to keep me outta trouble.

857
00:47:07.833 --> 00:47:09.625
-[chuckles]
Oh. is that so?

858
00:47:09.708 --> 00:47:11.958
-Yeah. Uh. believe it or not

859
00:47:12.042 --> 00:47:13.792
I used to be a bit of
a juvenile delinquent.

860
00:47:13.875 --> 00:47:15.958
So my parents started
sending me here.

861
00:47:16.042 --> 00:47:18.042
hoping the work would
set me straight.

862
00:47:18.125 --> 00:47:19.458
-Seems like it worked.

863
00:47:19.542 --> 00:47:20.333
-It did.

864
00:47:23.708 --> 00:47:25.458
-No way.

865
00:47:25.542 --> 00:47:27.250
-What?
-Oh my...

866
00:47:27.333 --> 00:47:32.208
My mom promised she wouldn't
bring this on vacation

867
00:47:32.208 --> 00:47:34.167
but I should've known to look
for it immediately.

868
00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:35.750
-You know your mom's password?

869
00:47:35.833 --> 00:47:37.000
-Um... yeah.

870
00:47:37.042 --> 00:47:39.792
Let's not tell her that
when we find her.

871
00:47:39.875 --> 00:47:42.417
-What are we looking for?

872
00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:44.667
-Um... all of her devices
are connected.

873
00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:46.792
so if she has
her phone on her.

874
00:47:46.875 --> 00:47:49.542
and the device tracking app
is working...

875
00:47:49.625 --> 00:47:50.958
Yes! Right there. look.

876
00:47:51.042 --> 00:47:52.250
-Yeah. I know right
where that is.

877
00:47:52.375 --> 00:47:53.333
-Okay.

878
00:47:53.458 --> 00:47:54.458
-I'll let my uncle know.

879
00:47:54.542 --> 00:47:56.167
-No. I...

880
00:47:56.292 --> 00:47:58.250
I don't wanna keep explaining
myself to men over and over

881
00:47:58.333 --> 00:48:01.833
that won't listen to me
or do anything.

882
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:02.917
No offense.

883
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.500
-None taken.

884
00:48:04.625 --> 00:48:05.667
-Can you take me?

885
00:48:05.708 --> 00:48:07.125
-Yeah. Let's go.

886
00:48:13.958 --> 00:48:15.125
-Do you see anything?

887
00:48:15.208 --> 00:48:16.125
-No.

888
00:48:18.667 --> 00:48:20.333
-Ugh. No.

889
00:48:20.417 --> 00:48:22.208
-What? What is it?

890
00:48:22.292 --> 00:48:24.750
-My phone just lost reception.

891
00:48:24.875 --> 00:48:26.833
My mom and I are on
the same plan. so...

892
00:48:26.917 --> 00:48:28.042
this is probably just
the last place

893
00:48:28.125 --> 00:48:29.667
that her phone had service.

894
00:48:34.167 --> 00:48:35.208
Mom?

895
00:48:36.333 --> 00:48:37.458
Dad?

896
00:48:38.333 --> 00:48:39.542
-What about your
dad's phone?

897
00:48:39.625 --> 00:48:41.333
-He's on a different plan
than us for work.

898
00:48:44.042 --> 00:48:45.792
-Hey. maybe we should head
back to the resort.

899
00:48:45.875 --> 00:48:49.000
I mean. if they try to call you.
you can be in service range.

900
00:48:49.125 --> 00:48:50.250
-Can't we just go a little
bit further?

901
00:48:50.333 --> 00:48:51.917
Maybe their car's
out there somewhere.

902
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.250
-Regan. the forest is huge.

903
00:48:54.375 --> 00:48:56.333
-Yeah. but you know this place.
Right?

904
00:48:56.333 --> 00:48:57.667
-Yeah.

905
00:48:57.708 --> 00:49:00.750
Any expert would tell you that
going too deep into the forest.

906
00:49:00.833 --> 00:49:04.083
without a plan.
is not a good idea.

907
00:49:05.292 --> 00:49:07.167
-I mean. at least we can give
this location to your uncle

908
00:49:07.208 --> 00:49:09.125
to help narrow down
the search area. Right?

909
00:49:09.208 --> 00:49:11.125
-Yeah. Yeah. it's a good point.

910
00:49:12.667 --> 00:49:13.583
Right.

911
00:49:25.042 --> 00:49:26.250
[car shuts off]

912
00:49:26.333 --> 00:49:28.083
-Well. thanks for coming
out there with me.

913
00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:30.375
-Do you want me to come in?

914
00:49:32.083 --> 00:49:33.958
-Uh... no. That's okay.

915
00:49:34.042 --> 00:49:35.667
I think I just wanna be alone
for a while.

916
00:49:37.958 --> 00:49:39.208
-I'll tell my uncle
about the signal

917
00:49:39.292 --> 00:49:42.125
and ask if anyone's
heard anything.

918
00:49:44.167 --> 00:49:45.625
Are you sure you're okay?

919
00:49:50.125 --> 00:49:53.875
-Yeah. I just...
things haven't been

920
00:49:53.958 --> 00:49:57.708
so great between me
and my parents recently.

921
00:49:57.792 --> 00:50:00.500
Especially me and my mom.

922
00:50:00.542 --> 00:50:02.667
She doesn't really
trust me anymore.

923
00:50:02.792 --> 00:50:04.042
-Why not?

924
00:50:06.708 --> 00:50:12.167
-Um... I made some mistakes.

925
00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:15.083
Over spring break my friends
wanted to throw this party.

926
00:50:15.167 --> 00:50:17.833
and I knew it was
a bad idea.

927
00:50:17.917 --> 00:50:19.750
Because I knew
that getting in trouble

928
00:50:19.833 --> 00:50:24.042
could jeopardize college.
my future... everything.

929
00:50:24.167 --> 00:50:25.708
-But you went along
with it anyway.

930
00:50:28.542 --> 00:50:30.625
-Yeah. I did.

931
00:50:30.708 --> 00:50:32.458
And it got out of control

932
00:50:32.542 --> 00:50:34.333
because people we didn't even
know were showing up.

933
00:50:34.417 --> 00:50:37.375
and all of these older guys
with so much alcohol.

934
00:50:37.458 --> 00:50:39.000
and I knew something
was gonna go wrong

935
00:50:39.083 --> 00:50:41.833
or someone was
gonna get hurt.

936
00:50:41.875 --> 00:50:43.208
-What happened?

937
00:50:44.625 --> 00:50:46.333
-Uh. everybody knows
that the cops came.

938
00:50:46.417 --> 00:50:48.458
but people don't know
that I called them.

939
00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:51.542
-Oh no.

940
00:50:53.542 --> 00:50:55.625
-If I don't get the chance
to earn her trust again

941
00:50:55.708 --> 00:50:57.000
or her forgiveness...

942
00:50:57.042 --> 00:50:58.958
-Hey. hey. hey. It's gonna
be okay. Right?

943
00:50:59.042 --> 00:51:01.250
It's only been a day.
Right?

944
00:51:01.333 --> 00:51:03.250
Uncle Jackson was right
when he said

945
00:51:03.375 --> 00:51:07.000
people get lost out here
all the time.

946
00:51:07.083 --> 00:51:10.333
They don't... they don't realize
how far something is on a map.

947
00:51:10.458 --> 00:51:12.208
Or they leave their
phones behind

948
00:51:12.292 --> 00:51:15.125
'cause they're trying
to unplug.

949
00:51:15.208 --> 00:51:17.833
But you know what?
They always turn up.

950
00:51:20.375 --> 00:51:23.833
-Yeah. I hope you're right.

951
00:51:23.917 --> 00:51:25.250
[sniffs]

952
00:51:26.875 --> 00:51:28.458
-I'll call you later. okay?

953
00:51:29.667 --> 00:51:30.667
-Okay.

954
00:51:36.292 --> 00:51:37.333
Thanks again.

955
00:51:37.417 --> 00:51:38.375
-Yeah.

956
00:51:40.875 --> 00:51:41.667
[car engine starts]

957
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:44.792
-Regan.

958
00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:56.708
-It looks like we...
we ran...

959
00:51:56.792 --> 00:52:02.292
we ran straight north...
after that wreck. so...

960
00:52:02.417 --> 00:52:06.167
hopefully the... the road's
still to the west of us.

961
00:52:08.042 --> 00:52:10.500
We just need to get away
from that lunatic

962
00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:12.625
so we can get back to it safely.

963
00:52:12.708 --> 00:52:14.792
-You were always good
at directions.

964
00:52:14.875 --> 00:52:15.792
-Yeah.

965
00:52:15.875 --> 00:52:17.000
-Oh! Ow. ow!
-Ooh. careful.

966
00:52:17.042 --> 00:52:18.625
-Ow. ow.

967
00:52:18.708 --> 00:52:23.333
-Wait. Wait. let's get...
back over here.

968
00:52:23.417 --> 00:52:24.833
-No. I'm okay.
-Yeah?

969
00:52:24.917 --> 00:52:25.750
-I'm okay.

970
00:52:27.083 --> 00:52:28.375
-Alright. Come here.
you need to sit down.

971
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.083
-You need to sit down.
-Alright.

972
00:52:32.167 --> 00:52:33.167
-Careful.

973
00:52:35.167 --> 00:52:37.292
-[groans]

974
00:52:37.375 --> 00:52:40.792
Regan would've told someone
that we were missing.

975
00:52:40.792 --> 00:52:42.917
Rangers are probably out
right now looking for us.

976
00:52:45.458 --> 00:52:46.542
-We need to get back to her

977
00:52:46.625 --> 00:52:50.042
before they realize
she's a liability.

978
00:52:50.125 --> 00:52:53.125
-Jackson wouldn't hurt a child.

979
00:52:53.208 --> 00:52:54.208
No.

980
00:52:56.042 --> 00:52:57.042
-What are you doing here?

981
00:52:57.167 --> 00:52:59.042
-I didn't mean to startle you.

982
00:52:59.125 --> 00:53:00.542
-Is it something
about my parents?

983
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:06.708
-Can we... go somewhere
and talk?

984
00:53:06.792 --> 00:53:08.167
I think your parents have
gotten mixed up in something

985
00:53:08.208 --> 00:53:10.542
I've been investigating.

986
00:53:10.625 --> 00:53:11.792
-Aren't you just a trainee?

987
00:53:11.875 --> 00:53:13.500
-Yes. But there's something big
happening here

988
00:53:13.583 --> 00:53:15.125
that a lot of people pretend
not to see.

989
00:53:15.208 --> 00:53:17.042
and I wanna put a stop
to those things.

990
00:53:17.125 --> 00:53:19.083
-Like what?

991
00:53:19.208 --> 00:53:20.625
-Like poaching.

992
00:53:20.708 --> 00:53:21.750
-Poaching?

993
00:53:23.458 --> 00:53:25.458
My parents would never be
involved in something like that.

994
00:53:25.542 --> 00:53:27.375
-Maybe not intentionally.

995
00:53:27.458 --> 00:53:29.917
Please. We shouldn't
talk here.

996
00:53:34.875 --> 00:53:35.792
[camera snaps]

997
00:53:37.958 --> 00:53:39.667
-Try anything and
there's evidence right there

998
00:53:39.708 --> 00:53:40.875
of who did it.

999
00:53:42.875 --> 00:53:44.375
-You're a smart girl.

1000
00:53:44.458 --> 00:53:46.333
But I hope I can show you
that I'm on your side.

1001
00:53:50.875 --> 00:53:53.375
[ominous music]

1002
00:53:59.208 --> 00:54:00.542
-You got the cash?

1003
00:54:02.958 --> 00:54:04.250
-Is it done?

1004
00:54:04.875 --> 00:54:06.250
-Almost.

1005
00:54:06.375 --> 00:54:07.750
-What's that supposed to mean?

1006
00:54:07.833 --> 00:54:10.500
-Look. they're not gonna be
an issue for you anymore.

1007
00:54:10.542 --> 00:54:12.333
You have my word.

1008
00:54:12.417 --> 00:54:14.667
Since when did you wanna know
all the dirty details?

1009
00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:17.542
-Since it's obvious you're
not telling me something.

1010
00:54:17.542 --> 00:54:19.375
-They tried to escape.
they crashed their car.

1011
00:54:19.458 --> 00:54:20.500
and they ran into the woods.

1012
00:54:20.542 --> 00:54:21.667
-That's not good enough.

1013
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:23.250
I got rangers sniffing around.

1014
00:54:23.375 --> 00:54:25.000
the FEDs are waiting
for just one mistake.

1015
00:54:25.083 --> 00:54:26.625
No loose ends.

1016
00:54:26.708 --> 00:54:30.000
-I clipped one in the leg.
They're as good as dead.

1017
00:54:30.083 --> 00:54:31.250
If anybody finds their body.

1018
00:54:31.333 --> 00:54:33.917
it's a case of a couple
of idiot hikers.

1019
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.042
Open and shut.

1020
00:54:36.125 --> 00:54:37.750
-Where's their car?

1021
00:54:37.833 --> 00:54:41.417
-Off the old logging road.
Just above the cabin.

1022
00:54:45.792 --> 00:54:48.625
-Alright.
Get back to the cabin.

1023
00:54:49.458 --> 00:54:52.667
Focus on prepping for
the clients next week.

1024
00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:53.708
It's all there.

1025
00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:57.917
Forget any of this
ever happened.

1026
00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.333
-Always do.

1027
00:55:08.083 --> 00:55:09.708
-It's wolves mostly.

1028
00:55:09.875 --> 00:55:11.792
Rich folks wanna hunt something
wild and dangerous.

1029
00:55:14.292 --> 00:55:15.917
-That's so cruel.

1030
00:55:16.042 --> 00:55:17.167
-It is.

1031
00:55:17.167 --> 00:55:18.417
I mean. it's not illegal
to hunt them.

1032
00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:20.083
but only within special
trapping seasons

1033
00:55:20.208 --> 00:55:22.458
and never in the park.

1034
00:55:22.583 --> 00:55:24.708
Wolves are protected
within federal lands.

1035
00:55:24.792 --> 00:55:27.833
That's where the poachers
come in.

1036
00:55:27.917 --> 00:55:29.333
-So why aren't your forest
ranger buddies

1037
00:55:29.458 --> 00:55:31.833
doing anything about it?

1038
00:55:31.917 --> 00:55:33.042
-Some have tried

1039
00:55:33.167 --> 00:55:35.125
but we're understaffed
on a huge amount of land.

1040
00:55:35.208 --> 00:55:37.292
And these people know how to
cover up what they're doing.

1041
00:55:37.375 --> 00:55:38.625
You know. say.
by owning a resort

1042
00:55:38.708 --> 00:55:41.333
just outside the
federal boundaries.

1043
00:55:41.375 --> 00:55:43.708
-You think the owner of
this place is in on it?

1044
00:55:43.792 --> 00:55:45.250
-Yeah.

1045
00:55:45.333 --> 00:55:47.833
-I still don't understand what
that has to do with my parents.

1046
00:55:47.875 --> 00:55:49.333
-Because the owner.
Jackson Green.

1047
00:55:49.417 --> 00:55:51.125
is an old friend
of your father's.

1048
00:55:51.208 --> 00:55:53.625
-That doesn't mean anything.
they went to college together.

1049
00:55:53.708 --> 00:55:55.333
-Jackson has a private
lounge downstairs

1050
00:55:55.417 --> 00:55:58.833
where he entertains
his important clientele.

1051
00:55:58.917 --> 00:56:01.250
I saw your father go
in empty-handed

1052
00:56:01.333 --> 00:56:03.500
and come out with an envelope.

1053
00:56:03.542 --> 00:56:06.042
And he looks nervous.

1054
00:56:06.125 --> 00:56:08.500
-But I talked to Jackson
and he said he would help.

1055
00:56:08.583 --> 00:56:09.875
-And you trust him?

1056
00:56:09.875 --> 00:56:10.833
-Yeah.

1057
00:56:10.875 --> 00:56:13.000
-You can't trust him. Regan.
Okay?

1058
00:56:13.083 --> 00:56:15.042
You can't trust either of them.

1059
00:56:15.125 --> 00:56:17.333
-But I can trust you?

1060
00:56:17.375 --> 00:56:19.333
The person calling my father
a poacher

1061
00:56:19.458 --> 00:56:21.000
because you saw him
with an envelope.

1062
00:56:21.083 --> 00:56:23.000
-I'm not calling your father
anything. Okay?

1063
00:56:23.125 --> 00:56:25.667
But he took something from
Jackson and now he's missing.

1064
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:27.542
That makes me think
he could be in danger.

1065
00:56:27.667 --> 00:56:29.000
-If this family is so dangerous

1066
00:56:29.125 --> 00:56:31.875
then why isn't anyone
doing anything about it?

1067
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.500
-Take a look around you.

1068
00:56:33.625 --> 00:56:36.167
They've been prominent in
this community for a long time.

1069
00:56:36.167 --> 00:56:39.333
If you know the right people.
and you have enough money.

1070
00:56:39.375 --> 00:56:41.042
you can get away with
just about anything.

1071
00:56:42.958 --> 00:56:44.250
-This is insane.

1072
00:56:44.375 --> 00:56:47.000
I mean. Tyler has done nothing
but help.

1073
00:56:47.042 --> 00:56:49.333
-Look. you have a decision
to make. Regan.

1074
00:56:49.417 --> 00:56:50.667
All I can tell you about myself

1075
00:56:50.708 --> 00:56:52.625
is how much I care about
keeping this place safe.

1076
00:56:52.708 --> 00:56:56.292
That includes the wolves
and your parents too.

1077
00:56:56.375 --> 00:56:57.458
And you.

1078
00:57:00.583 --> 00:57:02.208
I'll be close by.

1079
00:57:02.292 --> 00:57:04.375
Just please. don't go anywhere
with Jackson or Tyler again

1080
00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:05.833
without calling me.

1081
00:57:07.708 --> 00:57:10.542
This is the number to
my station and to my cell.

1082
00:57:10.625 --> 00:57:11.833
Call me any time.

1083
00:57:29.292 --> 00:57:31.125
[phone vibrates]

1084
00:57:35.167 --> 00:57:36.375
-Hey.

1085
00:57:36.458 --> 00:57:38.708
-Hey. Just calling
to check up on you.

1086
00:57:38.792 --> 00:57:41.917
-That's really sweet of you.
Thank you.

1087
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:42.958
-Any word?

1088
00:57:43.083 --> 00:57:45.583
-Not yet. Hey. can I ask you
a question?

1089
00:57:45.667 --> 00:57:47.250
-Yeah. What's up?

1090
00:57:47.333 --> 00:57:49.583
-When your uncle said that he
doesn't agree with the rangers

1091
00:57:49.667 --> 00:57:52.000
on much... what's his problem
with them?

1092
00:57:52.083 --> 00:57:54.042
-Oh. it's just local politics
and stuff.

1093
00:57:54.167 --> 00:57:57.500
Conservation versus commerce.
That eternal debate.

1094
00:57:57.583 --> 00:57:59.958
-He's not on the side
of conservation. I take it?

1095
00:58:00.042 --> 00:58:02.000
-Let's just say he's not
into being told

1096
00:58:02.042 --> 00:58:03.375
what he can or can't do.

1097
00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:06.458
-But he did call and ask them
for their help like he said?

1098
00:58:06.542 --> 00:58:08.000
-Of course.

1099
00:58:08.083 --> 00:58:11.875
All hands on deck.
just like we promised.

1100
00:58:11.958 --> 00:58:13.833
-Great.

1101
00:58:13.875 --> 00:58:15.917
Uh. look. I'm getting another
call so I gotta go.

1102
00:58:26.875 --> 00:58:28.042
-[voicemail] This is ranger
Ward.

1103
00:58:33.583 --> 00:58:35.667
[digging]

1104
00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:43.875
-Come in.

1105
00:58:44.542 --> 00:58:46.000
[sighs]

1106
00:58:49.417 --> 00:58:53.042
Jackson never called the ranger
station like he said he would.

1107
00:58:53.125 --> 00:58:55.167
-I could've told you that
before if you'd asked.

1108
00:58:55.333 --> 00:58:58.375
-Yeah. well I didn't know if I
could trust you then. did I?

1109
00:58:58.458 --> 00:58:59.833
-And what about now?

1110
00:59:01.542 --> 00:59:03.250
-Yeah.

1111
00:59:03.375 --> 00:59:04.625
I trust you.

1112
00:59:05.542 --> 00:59:06.875
And I have a plan.

1113
00:59:06.958 --> 00:59:08.500
You said you saw my dad leave
Jackson's lounge

1114
00:59:08.583 --> 00:59:10.292
with an envelope?

1115
00:59:10.375 --> 00:59:11.833
-That's right.

1116
00:59:11.917 --> 00:59:13.958
-I think there could be
information in there.

1117
00:59:14.042 --> 00:59:16.292
You know. help us find them.
know where they went.

1118
00:59:18.208 --> 00:59:20.167
-It's possible.

1119
00:59:20.208 --> 00:59:21.833
-Help me get in there.

1120
00:59:21.875 --> 00:59:22.625
-If you get caught...

1121
00:59:22.708 --> 00:59:23.833
-I won't.

1122
00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:26.000
Not with your help.

1123
00:59:28.875 --> 00:59:31.917
But if you say no...
I'm going anyway.

1124
00:59:33.708 --> 00:59:36.833
[dramatic music]

1125
00:59:42.792 --> 00:59:45.458
-Jackson always makes
the rounds at 7:00 PM.

1126
00:59:45.542 --> 00:59:47.000
He'll be in the bar
for at least an hour

1127
00:59:47.125 --> 00:59:50.083
schmoozing with the guests.
looking for potential clients.

1128
00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:55.083
-That's our window.

1129
00:59:56.625 --> 00:59:58.833
-Cleaning staff always
has master keys.

1130
01:00:01.292 --> 01:00:04.000
The trick is making sure they
never know the keys are gone.

1131
01:00:27.042 --> 01:00:27.917
[drawers squeak]

1132
01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:41.500
-Hey.

1133
01:00:41.583 --> 01:00:42.875
-I'm still looking.

1134
01:00:48.083 --> 01:00:50.125
-Regan. Tyler just walked in.

1135
01:00:50.208 --> 01:00:51.167
-Hi.

1136
01:00:51.250 --> 01:00:52.375
-Excuse me.
If you guys need anything...

1137
01:00:52.458 --> 01:00:53.500
-Wait. is he coming back
this way?

1138
01:00:53.542 --> 01:00:54.792
-I'm watching.

1139
01:00:58.875 --> 01:01:00.167
-We gotta talk in your office.

1140
01:01:02.167 --> 01:01:03.667
-You need to get
outta there now.

1141
01:01:03.708 --> 01:01:05.417
-No. no. no!
I need more time.

1142
01:01:05.542 --> 01:01:06.458
-Regan. get out.

1143
01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:09.208
They're coming your way.

1144
01:01:12.708 --> 01:01:15.833
[ominous music]

1145
01:01:18.458 --> 01:01:21.875
-I'll be honest. I'm glad
we got rid of that guy.

1146
01:01:21.958 --> 01:01:23.333
We don't need him.

1147
01:01:26.042 --> 01:01:28.208
-Yeah. now that you're
stepping up. we sure don't.

1148
01:01:33.458 --> 01:01:34.875
And what about the Gerards?

1149
01:01:34.958 --> 01:01:36.667
I wanted them handled
before the day was out.

1150
01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:38.250
-There wasn't enough time.

1151
01:01:38.333 --> 01:01:40.875
The sun's going down.
I can't track Â´em in the dark.

1152
01:01:40.958 --> 01:01:43.875
I managed to ditch
their car though.

1153
01:01:43.875 --> 01:01:46.708
-I am not gonna let Craig ruin
everything I built.

1154
01:01:46.792 --> 01:01:49.625
-What's the story
with you two anyway?

1155
01:01:49.708 --> 01:01:53.125
-Everything always came
so easy to Craig.

1156
01:01:53.208 --> 01:01:55.458
In college he had
a perfect girlfriend.

1157
01:01:55.542 --> 01:01:57.292
Quarterback.

1158
01:01:57.375 --> 01:01:59.750
Dean's list.

1159
01:01:59.833 --> 01:02:02.083
And honestly. I didn't care.
I was happy for him.

1160
01:02:04.375 --> 01:02:06.458
Until senior year.

1161
01:02:06.542 --> 01:02:08.292
-Was he why you quit college?

1162
01:02:08.375 --> 01:02:11.500
-Oh. no. no. no. no. no.
I didn't quit.

1163
01:02:11.542 --> 01:02:13.167
I was asked to leave.

1164
01:02:17.958 --> 01:02:19.750
It was after a football game.

1165
01:02:21.667 --> 01:02:23.000
He picked a fight
with some of the players

1166
01:02:23.042 --> 01:02:24.667
from the opposing team.

1167
01:02:24.708 --> 01:02:27.542
He was gonna get pummeled
so I jumped in.

1168
01:02:29.083 --> 01:02:31.208
Things got outta control

1169
01:02:31.292 --> 01:02:33.583
and the guy sustained
some serious injuries.

1170
01:02:33.708 --> 01:02:36.750
And then Craig's daddy
and the university swooped in

1171
01:02:36.833 --> 01:02:38.583
and saved him from
all repercussions.

1172
01:02:38.708 --> 01:02:40.333
And I was blamed
for everything.

1173
01:02:43.042 --> 01:02:46.167
And then his dad died and
he was left the business.

1174
01:02:47.542 --> 01:02:49.042
He was handed everything.

1175
01:02:50.333 --> 01:02:52.167
You know. having him come
to me begging for money

1176
01:02:52.250 --> 01:02:54.833
'cause he couldn't hack it...

1177
01:02:54.875 --> 01:02:56.917
that was one of the best days
of my life.

1178
01:02:59.750 --> 01:03:04.875
But... well. he's outlived
his usefulness at this point.

1179
01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.208
-I'll handle Â´em.

1180
01:03:07.917 --> 01:03:09.917
-Yeah. you'd better.

1181
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.167
We can't go another day

1182
01:03:11.292 --> 01:03:13.208
without actually sending out
a search party.

1183
01:03:13.292 --> 01:03:15.042
Their daughter
isn't that stupid.

1184
01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:17.042
-No. but she trusts me.

1185
01:03:17.208 --> 01:03:19.333
If things were to turn sideways
I can handle her too.

1186
01:03:19.375 --> 01:03:20.125
-No. no. no.

1187
01:03:20.208 --> 01:03:21.250
Just look. too many people know

1188
01:03:21.333 --> 01:03:22.667
she's been asking questions.
Alright?

1189
01:03:22.792 --> 01:03:24.500
Just settle down.

1190
01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:25.667
Make sure you find the Gerards

1191
01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:32.667
before anyone else has
a chance to. Okay?

1192
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:37.042
We can still make this
out to be a. uh...

1193
01:03:37.042 --> 01:03:39.042
misadventure on their part.

1194
01:03:40.542 --> 01:03:43.833
-Don't worry.
I'll go out at first light.

1195
01:03:43.917 --> 01:03:45.250
I've got this.

1196
01:03:50.875 --> 01:03:54.083
-I'm trusting you.
Don't make me regret it.

1197
01:04:02.625 --> 01:04:05.875
[door opens and shuts]

1198
01:04:10.042 --> 01:04:12.125
-[breathing heavily]

1199
01:04:12.833 --> 01:04:14.333
-Shh. shh. shh!
It's me.

1200
01:04:14.458 --> 01:04:15.792
Tell me what happened.

1201
01:04:15.875 --> 01:04:18.292
-[panting]

1202
01:04:19.708 --> 01:04:23.167
We have to stop Tyler.
He's gonna kill my parents.

1203
01:04:29.125 --> 01:04:31.417
-We should go to the rangers.
Tell them what's going on.

1204
01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:32.667
-No. No!

1205
01:04:32.708 --> 01:04:35.625
Tyler and Jackson are just
gonna deny everything.

1206
01:04:36.875 --> 01:04:40.000
And they're gonna know
it was me.

1207
01:04:40.083 --> 01:04:42.292
They have an idea
of where they are.

1208
01:04:42.375 --> 01:04:44.292
Nobody else knows where
to look for my parents.

1209
01:04:46.083 --> 01:04:47.458
-So we follow Tyler.

1210
01:04:48.542 --> 01:04:49.958
-It's our only chance.

1211
01:04:50.042 --> 01:04:51.333
-It could work.

1212
01:04:51.417 --> 01:04:52.792
The rangers have tracking
devices for animals.

1213
01:04:52.917 --> 01:04:54.500
If we could just plant
one on him...

1214
01:04:55.042 --> 01:04:57.458
-Yeah. I could do it.
I'll ask to see him tonight.

1215
01:04:57.542 --> 01:04:58.792
-No. no way.

1216
01:04:58.875 --> 01:05:00.250
Not after we know
what he's capable of.

1217
01:05:01.042 --> 01:05:03.417
-I can't let him
find them first.

1218
01:05:06.375 --> 01:05:07.542
-Okay.

1219
01:05:12.625 --> 01:05:14.417
[party music playing]

1220
01:05:20.833 --> 01:05:22.583
-Sorry. give me one sec.

1221
01:05:24.042 --> 01:05:25.167
-How's it going?
-Hey.

1222
01:05:25.208 --> 01:05:26.667
-You can take a seat
right here.

1223
01:05:28.875 --> 01:05:30.083
-Thanks for the invite.

1224
01:05:30.167 --> 01:05:31.667
I. uh. needed to get out
of my cabin.

1225
01:05:31.708 --> 01:05:33.833
-Yeah. of course.

1226
01:05:33.875 --> 01:05:37.083
Um... I wish we could meet under
better circumstances. but...

1227
01:05:37.167 --> 01:05:38.458
it's good to see you.

1228
01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:42.250
-So do you guys do
this every night?

1229
01:05:42.333 --> 01:05:43.333
-[chuckles]
Yeah.

1230
01:05:43.375 --> 01:05:46.208
It's a really good way
to unwind.

1231
01:05:46.333 --> 01:05:48.042
-Do you like your co-workers?

1232
01:05:48.167 --> 01:05:50.167
-Yeah. they're okay.

1233
01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:53.083
Most of them are just seasonal
employees. so...

1234
01:05:53.208 --> 01:05:56.167
we don't get too attached
to anyone around here.

1235
01:05:56.250 --> 01:05:57.167
-Hmm.

1236
01:05:58.458 --> 01:06:01.292
-Oh! Are you. uh...
are you thirsty?

1237
01:06:01.375 --> 01:06:03.333
-Uh... actually do you have
anything else?

1238
01:06:03.417 --> 01:06:04.333
I don't...

1239
01:06:04.417 --> 01:06:07.917
-Oh. right. Sorry about that.
Stupid me.

1240
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.542
I'll be right back.
Don't move.

1241
01:06:17.708 --> 01:06:18.542
[bottles clinking]

1242
01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:37.708
So they only had this.
uh. this cola here.

1243
01:06:37.792 --> 01:06:41.792
The... Hey. are you okay?

1244
01:06:41.875 --> 01:06:43.250
-Oh. sorry. I just...

1245
01:06:43.375 --> 01:06:45.333
Maybe I shouldn't have
come out tonight.

1246
01:06:45.375 --> 01:06:49.208
-Okay. Uh... maybe the...
the drink will help?

1247
01:06:49.333 --> 01:06:52.167
-I don't think so.
Um... but thank you.

1248
01:06:52.292 --> 01:06:54.500
I'll call you tomorrow. okay?

1249
01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:56.417
-Yeah. Okay.

1250
01:07:01.542 --> 01:07:03.417
[crickets chirping]

1251
01:07:10.708 --> 01:07:13.583
[soft music]

1252
01:07:15.875 --> 01:07:17.542
-You should try and go to sleep.

1253
01:07:19.042 --> 01:07:20.583
-I wish I could.

1254
01:07:22.958 --> 01:07:25.167
-I wanna tell you something.

1255
01:07:27.042 --> 01:07:29.583
-Have we reached final
confession time already?

1256
01:07:30.708 --> 01:07:32.458
-I'm serious.

1257
01:07:32.542 --> 01:07:35.333
-I'm sorry.
I'm listening.

1258
01:07:38.250 --> 01:07:40.833
-Bringing Regan on this trip.

1259
01:07:40.917 --> 01:07:44.875
it wasn't Â´cause I was worried
about leaving her home alone.

1260
01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.833
I mean. despite what she thinks.
I actually do trust her.

1261
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.208
-Okay.

1262
01:07:55.292 --> 01:07:57.583
-My real worry was us.

1263
01:07:59.083 --> 01:08:02.167
Romantic couple's vacation?

1264
01:08:02.292 --> 01:08:03.833
-Could end up being a disaster.

1265
01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:08.458
-Yeah.

1266
01:08:08.542 --> 01:08:13.458
-Well... I guess it turned out
better than I expected. huh?

1267
01:08:13.542 --> 01:08:15.250
[both chuckle]

1268
01:08:21.292 --> 01:08:25.125
-We've just been so
out of sync lately.

1269
01:08:25.208 --> 01:08:27.208
How did it come to this?

1270
01:08:30.167 --> 01:08:32.667
-We both were consumed by work.

1271
01:08:35.917 --> 01:08:40.125
-[sighs] Yeah.
I guess so.

1272
01:08:47.417 --> 01:08:48.917
[sighs]

1273
01:08:52.625 --> 01:08:55.375
-Well. if this is confession
time. I have one.

1274
01:09:00.375 --> 01:09:03.500
I borrowed money from Jackson
last year to save the store.

1275
01:09:06.042 --> 01:09:08.792
That's why we're here.

1276
01:09:08.875 --> 01:09:15.333
I organized this trip to tell
him in person that I was done.

1277
01:09:15.417 --> 01:09:17.292
-I thought you said everything
was okay.

1278
01:09:19.958 --> 01:09:21.292
You said that...

1279
01:09:21.375 --> 01:09:22.417
that we had enough of a safety
net to keep going.

1280
01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:25.333
-Jackson was our safety net.

1281
01:09:25.375 --> 01:09:27.333
I paid him back but
that wasn't enough.

1282
01:09:29.125 --> 01:09:31.917
-What do you mean.
did he need more money?

1283
01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.208
-Not exactly.

1284
01:09:35.833 --> 01:09:42.708
He wanted me to help build a...
a clientele base in New York

1285
01:09:42.833 --> 01:09:47.125
of all those wealthy
east coast hunters

1286
01:09:47.208 --> 01:09:51.958
that are interested
in exotic adventures.

1287
01:09:52.042 --> 01:09:53.333
-Illegal poaching.

1288
01:09:55.333 --> 01:09:56.750
You knew?

1289
01:09:56.833 --> 01:10:02.875
-No. I... I mean.
I didn't at first.

1290
01:10:02.875 --> 01:10:05.208
Then I started to hear things
from the people

1291
01:10:05.292 --> 01:10:07.000
I referred to the lodge.

1292
01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:17.250
I guess I suspected more than
I wanted to admit.

1293
01:10:18.917 --> 01:10:21.500
I told him I wanted out.

1294
01:10:21.542 --> 01:10:23.667
-Someone like that doesn't
take no for an answer.

1295
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:26.667
-I thought he was just trying to
show me that he was in control

1296
01:10:26.833 --> 01:10:29.875
by sending me on this
dumb errand

1297
01:10:29.958 --> 01:10:33.500
in exchange for not telling you
about the... the money.

1298
01:10:33.583 --> 01:10:38.417
I swear. I swear. I never
thought we'd be in danger.

1299
01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:41.667
-You knew all along
and you lied to me.

1300
01:10:41.708 --> 01:10:42.750
-I know.

1301
01:10:45.667 --> 01:10:50.542
I didn't want you to think
less of me.

1302
01:10:50.625 --> 01:10:52.667
I'm so sorry about all of it.

1303
01:11:03.458 --> 01:11:04.667
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

1304
01:11:07.417 --> 01:11:09.000
-I don't know how I'm supposed
to stay here all night.

1305
01:11:09.083 --> 01:11:10.417
I feel like I should be
out there

1306
01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:11.500
looking for them right now.

1307
01:11:12.583 --> 01:11:16.708
-It's just a few more hours.
You should get some sleep.

1308
01:11:18.208 --> 01:11:20.167
-Will you stay?

1309
01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:22.833
-Of course.
You're safe. I promise.

1310
01:11:25.042 --> 01:11:26.542
-I believe you.

1311
01:11:32.667 --> 01:11:33.708
Thank you.

1312
01:11:42.292 --> 01:11:45.333
[dramatic music]

1313
01:11:46.375 --> 01:11:48.417
-[wolves howling]
-[branch cracks]

1314
01:12:06.417 --> 01:12:07.750
-Craig! Wake up.
-What's going on?

1315
01:12:07.875 --> 01:12:08.750
-Wake up.

1316
01:12:10.958 --> 01:12:12.500
-Is that a wolf?

1317
01:12:12.583 --> 01:12:14.542
-Yeah. we must be too close
to their territory.

1318
01:12:14.667 --> 01:12:16.000
We have to head back
towards the route.

1319
01:12:16.083 --> 01:12:18.083
-Okay.
-Okay.

1320
01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:19.167
-Okay.
-[groans]

1321
01:12:19.208 --> 01:12:20.250
Hold on.

1322
01:12:20.333 --> 01:12:21.542
-We need to move.
Can you make it?

1323
01:12:21.542 --> 01:12:22.833
-Yeah. I'll be fine.

1324
01:12:22.917 --> 01:12:23.917
-Okay. let's go.

1325
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:24.958
-[groans]
-Come on.

1326
01:12:25.083 --> 01:12:26.042
-Okay. Ow.

1327
01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:29.917
-There you are.
You scared me.

1328
01:12:31.292 --> 01:12:33.167
-Oh. sorry.
I couldn't sleep.

1329
01:12:33.250 --> 01:12:34.833
-Do you want some company?

1330
01:12:34.917 --> 01:12:35.958
-Sure.

1331
01:12:40.542 --> 01:12:42.458
It's so peaceful out here.

1332
01:12:43.875 --> 01:12:46.000
I never knew a place
could feel like this.

1333
01:12:47.917 --> 01:12:51.000
I understand why you wanna
protect it at all costs.

1334
01:12:52.625 --> 01:12:54.000
-My parents have always
been involved

1335
01:12:54.042 --> 01:12:55.792
in environmental issues.

1336
01:12:55.875 --> 01:12:58.417
Protesting projects that harm
the land. that sort of thing.

1337
01:12:59.833 --> 01:13:02.458
[chuckles] I remember one time
when I was 11 or 12.

1338
01:13:02.542 --> 01:13:03.667
my parents dropped me off
at my grandma's

1339
01:13:03.792 --> 01:13:05.667
so they could go to a protest.

1340
01:13:05.708 --> 01:13:07.542
They didn't come back.

1341
01:13:07.625 --> 01:13:10.792
I didn't know where they were
for three days.

1342
01:13:10.875 --> 01:13:12.500
-What happened?

1343
01:13:12.542 --> 01:13:15.125
-All the protestors
had been arrested.

1344
01:13:15.208 --> 01:13:18.042
They were finally let out
and everything was fine. but...

1345
01:13:18.125 --> 01:13:21.500
I was never so scared in my life
not knowing where they were.

1346
01:13:21.583 --> 01:13:22.958
I understand how
you're feeling.

1347
01:13:29.167 --> 01:13:33.500
-Are they the reason you risk
so much to expose the poachers?

1348
01:13:33.542 --> 01:13:34.917
-They taught me not to back down
from people

1349
01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.125
who care more about money
than about living creatures.

1350
01:13:41.583 --> 01:13:44.500
-I'm glad you got them back.

1351
01:13:44.625 --> 01:13:46.667
I really hope I get
mine back too.

1352
01:13:51.958 --> 01:13:54.750
I just can't stop thinking
about them being out there.

1353
01:13:54.875 --> 01:13:58.292
you know. possibly hurt
or something.

1354
01:13:58.375 --> 01:13:59.542
[sighs]

1355
01:13:59.625 --> 01:14:00.917
What if they don't make it
to tomorrow?

1356
01:14:01.042 --> 01:14:02.042
-Hey.

1357
01:14:02.208 --> 01:14:06.083
They must be pretty smart.
They raised you. right?

1358
01:14:06.167 --> 01:14:10.708
Plus. I met your mother.
She seems pretty tough to me.

1359
01:14:10.833 --> 01:14:12.375
[chuckles]

1360
01:14:12.542 --> 01:14:14.458
They'll take care
of themselves.

1361
01:14:15.667 --> 01:14:17.750
And we'll find them.
I promise.

1362
01:14:27.125 --> 01:14:30.167
[dramatic music]

1363
01:14:35.542 --> 01:14:36.917
-How does it look?

1364
01:14:37.958 --> 01:14:40.333
-He's about a quarter
mile ahead.

1365
01:14:40.417 --> 01:14:42.000
-Okay.

1366
01:14:42.042 --> 01:14:43.083
Good.

1367
01:14:55.875 --> 01:14:57.500
-Wait. he's slowing down.

1368
01:15:10.917 --> 01:15:11.792
It stopped.

1369
01:15:13.125 --> 01:15:14.292
I think he parked.

1370
01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:37.625
[dramatic music]

1371
01:16:02.583 --> 01:16:03.917
-Here!

1372
01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:06.708
-Shh. Sound carries out here.

1373
01:16:06.833 --> 01:16:08.583
-This could be from their car.

1374
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.125
-This way.

1375
01:16:33.208 --> 01:16:35.167
[both groaning]

1376
01:16:36.458 --> 01:16:38.250
-Ahhhh!!!!

1377
01:16:38.333 --> 01:16:39.667
[panting]

1378
01:16:40.542 --> 01:16:41.917
-Oh God.

1379
01:16:42.042 --> 01:16:43.083
Okay.

1380
01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:50.708
-[coughing]

1381
01:16:52.083 --> 01:16:53.042
-Here.

1382
01:16:56.708 --> 01:16:58.833
-I think you should leave
me here.

1383
01:16:58.917 --> 01:17:02.583
-No. I am not doing that.

1384
01:17:02.667 --> 01:17:05.792
-You need to think about
at least one of us

1385
01:17:05.875 --> 01:17:08.000
getting back to Regan.

1386
01:17:08.042 --> 01:17:10.000
-Okay. you listen to me
right now. Okay?

1387
01:17:10.125 --> 01:17:13.875
We are both making it
back to Regan. Okay?

1388
01:17:13.958 --> 01:17:18.375
I have reported from war zones.
from natural disasters...

1389
01:17:18.458 --> 01:17:19.542
and I have seen
a lot of people

1390
01:17:19.667 --> 01:17:21.708
in a lot worse situations
than this.

1391
01:17:21.833 --> 01:17:23.167
We are not giving up
that easily.

1392
01:17:23.250 --> 01:17:24.333
Do you understand?

1393
01:17:25.375 --> 01:17:26.250
-Okay.

1394
01:17:28.042 --> 01:17:29.458
-Craig.

1395
01:17:29.542 --> 01:17:30.333
Craig!

1396
01:17:31.958 --> 01:17:35.208
Craig. Craig. Craig!

1397
01:17:37.583 --> 01:17:39.167
[grunts]

1398
01:17:47.542 --> 01:17:48.917
-Beautiful. isn't it?

1399
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.042
-Ranger Ward. Morning.

1400
01:17:52.167 --> 01:17:53.542
-Mr Green. uh...

1401
01:17:53.625 --> 01:17:56.250
I just wanted to let you know
we're gonna be starting

1402
01:17:56.333 --> 01:17:59.333
that search for that couple
who were staying here.

1403
01:17:59.417 --> 01:18:01.125
-Yeah. of course.
Of course.

1404
01:18:01.208 --> 01:18:02.917
You know we hope for the best
in these situations.

1405
01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.458
but unfortunately sometimes...

1406
01:18:04.542 --> 01:18:07.917
-Unfortunately sometimes people
think they can handle this area

1407
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.875
when they are woefully
inexperienced.

1408
01:18:11.958 --> 01:18:16.042
Listen. I wanted to speak
with their daughter Regan

1409
01:18:16.125 --> 01:18:19.583
but. uh. I haven't been able
to track her down this morning.

1410
01:18:19.667 --> 01:18:22.042
-She wasn't at her
family's cabin?

1411
01:18:22.167 --> 01:18:23.958
-She's not answering
her phone either.

1412
01:18:24.042 --> 01:18:27.125
-Hmm. Well I'm sure
she's nearby.

1413
01:18:27.208 --> 01:18:29.500
She'd wanna participate
in the search. right?

1414
01:18:29.583 --> 01:18:31.417
-That's what I thought. but...

1415
01:18:33.542 --> 01:18:35.333
Don't tell me you've lost
her too.

1416
01:18:57.583 --> 01:18:58.792
-Hey. wait.

1417
01:18:58.875 --> 01:19:00.167
It stopped again.

1418
01:19:02.042 --> 01:19:03.250
-He could be taking a break.

1419
01:19:03.333 --> 01:19:04.833
-Yeah. or he could've found
the tracker.

1420
01:19:04.917 --> 01:19:06.167
-Gotcha!
-[gasps]

1421
01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:12.792
-[sobbing]

1422
01:19:18.625 --> 01:19:19.875
-[Regan] Let me go!

1423
01:19:22.333 --> 01:19:25.250
[intense music]

1424
01:19:26.542 --> 01:19:27.708
-Get your hands off of her.

1425
01:19:27.792 --> 01:19:31.000
-You two thought you were
so clever.

1426
01:19:31.042 --> 01:19:33.167
Is he the type of guy
that you're into?

1427
01:19:33.208 --> 01:19:34.542
The hero type?

1428
01:19:34.625 --> 01:19:36.167
How boring.

1429
01:19:36.208 --> 01:19:37.208
-Oh. screw you.

1430
01:19:37.208 --> 01:19:38.333
[thud]

1431
01:19:38.458 --> 01:19:40.083
-[grunts]

1432
01:19:40.542 --> 01:19:41.542
Come back here you little...

1433
01:19:41.625 --> 01:19:42.625
-Hey psycho!

1434
01:19:42.708 --> 01:19:44.167
-[groans]

1435
01:19:44.208 --> 01:19:46.208
[blows thudding]

1436
01:19:50.542 --> 01:19:51.333
-[thud]

1437
01:19:51.708 --> 01:19:52.500
-Jude!

1438
01:19:57.292 --> 01:19:57.875
-[laughs]

1439
01:19:57.958 --> 01:19:58.833
That's cute.

1440
01:19:58.875 --> 01:20:00.208
-Screw you.

1441
01:20:01.333 --> 01:20:03.083
You know you're just like
your uncle?

1442
01:20:03.167 --> 01:20:05.667
-There's worse people
to look up to.

1443
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:07.833
Do you really think you can
outsmart me?

1444
01:20:11.250 --> 01:20:12.083
[chuckles]

1445
01:20:13.833 --> 01:20:15.208
Nice try.

1446
01:20:18.208 --> 01:20:18.958
[thud]

1447
01:20:22.083 --> 01:20:25.500
-Don't move or I will gladly put
this branch through your skull.

1448
01:20:25.542 --> 01:20:26.333
-Mom!

1449
01:20:26.417 --> 01:20:27.375
-We need rope.

1450
01:20:27.542 --> 01:20:28.375
-He has a backpack.

1451
01:20:28.458 --> 01:20:29.500
-Go see if he's got rope.

1452
01:20:30.292 --> 01:20:31.833
I said don't move!

1453
01:20:38.708 --> 01:20:40.333
Quick.

1454
01:20:40.417 --> 01:20:41.917
Alright. get up.

1455
01:20:42.042 --> 01:20:43.500
Turn around.

1456
01:20:43.542 --> 01:20:44.875
Slowly!

1457
01:20:46.583 --> 01:20:47.958
-YouÂ´re gonna regret this.

1458
01:20:48.708 --> 01:20:49.625
-Move!

1459
01:20:50.750 --> 01:20:52.375
Up against that tree.

1460
01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:54.000
Get down.

1461
01:21:05.333 --> 01:21:07.542
-[groaning]

1462
01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:11.292
-Here. let me help you up.

1463
01:21:12.958 --> 01:21:13.917
Are you okay?

1464
01:21:14.042 --> 01:21:15.208
-Uh huh.
-Okay.

1465
01:21:19.083 --> 01:21:22.000
-Well this is convenient.

1466
01:21:22.042 --> 01:21:24.000
Got you all in one place.

1467
01:21:25.208 --> 01:21:27.125
Drop the knife. Sarah.

1468
01:21:30.042 --> 01:21:32.042
Everybody on the ground.

1469
01:21:32.542 --> 01:21:33.625
-Mom.

1470
01:21:33.708 --> 01:21:34.667
-Just do what he says.

1471
01:21:36.125 --> 01:21:38.167
-Go on. There you go.

1472
01:21:40.292 --> 01:21:41.458
Where is he?

1473
01:21:43.333 --> 01:21:44.583
[Jackson] Hmm?

1474
01:21:49.875 --> 01:21:51.000
-Mom?

1475
01:21:51.083 --> 01:21:52.417
-It's okay. baby.

1476
01:21:54.792 --> 01:21:57.667
-[laughs]

1477
01:21:57.750 --> 01:22:02.083
Well that serves him right.
Spineless. worthless coward.

1478
01:22:02.208 --> 01:22:04.167
Almost ruined my life
for the second time.

1479
01:22:04.250 --> 01:22:05.208
Almost!

1480
01:22:06.250 --> 01:22:08.667
Everybody always had
to rescue Craig.

1481
01:22:08.708 --> 01:22:11.042
could never save himself.

1482
01:22:13.542 --> 01:22:15.542
Couldn't even provide
for his own family.

1483
01:22:15.625 --> 01:22:18.333
-Yeah. well at least he had a
family worth fighting for. Okay?

1484
01:22:18.458 --> 01:22:19.750
-Shut up.

1485
01:22:19.833 --> 01:22:22.000
-And you...

1486
01:22:22.042 --> 01:22:24.000
I couldn't rely on you
for one simple task?

1487
01:22:24.083 --> 01:22:24.917
-I tried.

1488
01:22:25.042 --> 01:22:26.333
-[mocking]
I tried!

1489
01:22:28.875 --> 01:22:31.208
Well if you want something done
right. you gotta do it yourself.

1490
01:22:31.333 --> 01:22:32.500
-[grunts]

1491
01:22:37.208 --> 01:22:38.375
-Ugh!

1492
01:22:39.333 --> 01:22:42.000
-It's over. okay?
Don't move.

1493
01:22:42.042 --> 01:22:43.500
-This is over when
I say it's over!

1494
01:22:46.375 --> 01:22:48.458
-Dad. Dad.

1495
01:22:48.542 --> 01:22:49.625
-Stay right there.

1496
01:22:51.958 --> 01:22:53.333
-Dammit!

1497
01:22:53.417 --> 01:22:55.833
-Sweetheart. You... you
found us.

1498
01:22:55.917 --> 01:22:57.875
-Yeah. Mom found me.

1499
01:22:57.958 --> 01:22:59.125
-Good.

1500
01:23:00.083 --> 01:23:01.375
It's okay.

1501
01:23:02.875 --> 01:23:04.167
[breathing heavily]

1502
01:23:04.250 --> 01:23:05.750
-You're gonna be okay.
you're gonna be okay.

1503
01:23:05.875 --> 01:23:09.625
Dad! Dad! Dad!
Stay with me.

1504
01:23:09.708 --> 01:23:10.792
Dad!

1505
01:23:16.792 --> 01:23:18.375
[velcro rips]

1506
01:23:21.792 --> 01:23:23.125
-Thank you.

1507
01:23:27.667 --> 01:23:28.583
Oh...

1508
01:23:28.667 --> 01:23:29.833
-How you feeling?

1509
01:23:29.917 --> 01:23:32.208
-Much better.

1510
01:23:32.333 --> 01:23:35.208
Whatever they've given me
is working.

1511
01:23:35.292 --> 01:23:37.042
-Only the best medicine
for my husband.

1512
01:23:37.125 --> 01:23:38.417
-[chuckles]

1513
01:23:39.542 --> 01:23:46.500
Hey... I am so sorry I got us
into this mess.

1514
01:23:46.583 --> 01:23:49.167
-I know you are.

1515
01:23:49.208 --> 01:23:53.958
-And thank you for not
giving up on me out there.

1516
01:23:54.042 --> 01:23:56.333
-I would never.

1517
01:23:56.417 --> 01:24:02.958
-And I promise from now on
I'll always be honest with you.

1518
01:24:03.042 --> 01:24:05.083
No more lies.

1519
01:24:05.208 --> 01:24:09.917
-And I know I haven't always
been present for you.

1520
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.542
I love my job. but...

1521
01:24:12.667 --> 01:24:14.625
you have to know
that there is no story

1522
01:24:14.708 --> 01:24:17.750
that is more important to me
than the story of our family.

1523
01:24:21.042 --> 01:24:22.542
-I'm glad to hear that.

1524
01:24:23.875 --> 01:24:26.500
-I love you.
-I love you too.

1525
01:24:32.875 --> 01:24:36.042
-Mom? Can I talk to you
for a sec?

1526
01:24:36.125 --> 01:24:37.500
-Of course.

1527
01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:39.750
-Go on.

1528
01:24:47.208 --> 01:24:50.750
-Hey. What is it?

1529
01:24:50.833 --> 01:24:53.292
-I know you haven't been
that happy with me recently.

1530
01:24:53.375 --> 01:24:56.708
-Oh. Honey. it's all
in the past.

1531
01:24:56.792 --> 01:24:58.667
Doesn't matter now.

1532
01:24:58.750 --> 01:25:00.250
-No. it does matter.

1533
01:25:00.333 --> 01:25:03.500
-Regan. I know that I have been
hard on you.

1534
01:25:03.542 --> 01:25:04.792
Too hard on you.

1535
01:25:06.917 --> 01:25:08.833
Your dad and I are
so proud of you

1536
01:25:08.917 --> 01:25:11.500
for the way you rescued us.

1537
01:25:11.583 --> 01:25:16.167
And I am really proud of you
for who you are.

1538
01:25:16.208 --> 01:25:17.625
-Thank you. Mom.

1539
01:25:19.833 --> 01:25:21.292
-I love you.

1540
01:25:22.833 --> 01:25:24.250
-I love you too.

1541
01:25:27.542 --> 01:25:29.542
-Jude. Thanks for everything.

1542
01:25:29.625 --> 01:25:31.333
-Of course. sir.
Safe travels.

1543
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.667
-Take care. Jude.
Thank you.

1544
01:25:37.083 --> 01:25:38.500
Honey.

1545
01:25:40.375 --> 01:25:41.750
-I wish we had a little
more time. you know.

1546
01:25:41.875 --> 01:25:45.917
under a little more
normal circumstances.

1547
01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:47.708
-I could write to you.

1548
01:25:47.792 --> 01:25:49.167
-Write to me?
-Mm-hmm.

1549
01:25:49.250 --> 01:25:50.417
-Like with a pen and paper?

1550
01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:53.167
-And envelope and stamp.

1551
01:25:53.208 --> 01:25:54.792
-[chuckles]
How quaint.

1552
01:25:58.708 --> 01:26:00.125
Okay.

1553
01:26:00.208 --> 01:26:01.833
