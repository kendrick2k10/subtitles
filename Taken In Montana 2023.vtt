[dramatic music]

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:40.917
-Can you tell?

5
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.875
I'm feeling more
relaxed already.

6
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.833
-That's great. honey.

7
00:00:44.875 --> 00:00:46.083
-Huh?
-Hmm?

8
00:00:46.167 --> 00:00:47.458
-Oh. you just wait.

9
00:00:47.542 --> 00:00:50.583
You haven't seen mountains
or forests like that.

10
00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:51.667
Look. look!

11
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.500
-Oh yeah.

12
00:00:57.583 --> 00:01:01.000
-Hi. Craig Gerard.
I made a reservation last month.

13
00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:02.875
-I have it right here.

14
00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.167
First time visiting Montana?

15
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.667
-Oh yeah. uh. we're headed up
to Big Sky.

16
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.000
-You'll have your pick of
many beautiful hiking trails.

17
00:01:09.042 --> 00:01:10.083
-Oh. fantastic.
Thank you.

18
00:01:10.167 --> 00:01:11.667
[phone ringing]

00:01:11.708 --> 00:01:13.375
-[scoffs]
Oh crap.

20
00:01:13.458 --> 00:01:15.875
I told them not to call me
this week.

21
00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.417
-You should take that.

22
00:01:18.542 --> 00:01:19.792
-This is Sarah.

23
00:01:21.833 --> 00:01:25.458
No. I can't.

24
00:01:25.542 --> 00:01:28.250
Because I told you
I'm on vacation.

25
00:01:31.708 --> 00:01:32.833
-Hey Dad.

26
00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:34.500
-Yes?

27
00:01:34.542 --> 00:01:35.875
-Can I drive?

28
00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.333
-I don't know. Regan.

29
00:01:37.417 --> 00:01:40.667
-Please? I never get to practice
my driving.

30
00:01:40.792 --> 00:01:42.625
And isn't that the whole reason
we're in Montana.

31
00:01:42.708 --> 00:01:45.542
to get a totally different
experience than New York?

32
00:01:45.667 --> 00:01:49.000
-[chuckles]
Yeah. something like that.

33
00:01:49.083 --> 00:01:50.542
Only if your mom says yes.

34
00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:57.417
Alright. thank you.

35
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.833
-Give the story to Riley then.

36
00:02:00.542 --> 00:02:01.750
Yeah. seriously.

37
00:02:03.292 --> 00:02:06.250
Look. I really need this break.
Okay?

38
00:02:06.375 --> 00:02:09.083
For me and for my family.

39
00:02:10.667 --> 00:02:11.833
Thanks.

40
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.167
-Hey!

41
00:02:16.167 --> 00:02:19.667
Hello. Uh. candy for the road?
Two for $5.

42
00:02:19.792 --> 00:02:20.958
-How much for that?

43
00:02:21.042 --> 00:02:23.625
-My Swiss army knife?

44
00:02:23.708 --> 00:02:24.917
-Yeah.

45
00:02:25.042 --> 00:02:28.000
-Well. this is a very
useful multitool.

46
00:02:28.042 --> 00:02:31.417
-I'm aware.
I'll give you 20 bucks.

47
00:02:31.542 --> 00:02:34.500
-25 and I'll throw in
a chocolate too?

48
00:02:34.542 --> 00:02:35.500
-Deal.

49
00:02:38.708 --> 00:02:40.250
´Kay. 25.

50
00:02:42.083 --> 00:02:43.667
-Pleasure doing business
with ya.

51
00:02:44.833 --> 00:02:45.792
-[chuckles]

52
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.167
-What do you need that for?

53
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.250
-Well... take a look out there

54
00:02:56.333 --> 00:02:58.875
at that wilderness
we're heading into.

55
00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.875
You can never be too prepared.

56
00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:05.542
-Okay. So... how do you feel

57
00:03:05.667 --> 00:03:08.833
about helping me prepare
for a potential situation

58
00:03:08.917 --> 00:03:10.417
where I'd need
to drive a car?

59
00:03:15.667 --> 00:03:18.000
-Make sure you slow down
around the curves.

60
00:03:18.083 --> 00:03:20.167
-Yeah. I know. Mom.

61
00:03:20.208 --> 00:03:22.583
-It is really beautiful
out here.

62
00:03:22.708 --> 00:03:23.792
Come on. be honest.

63
00:03:23.875 --> 00:03:26.292
Isn't this better than being
home by yourself?

64
00:03:26.375 --> 00:03:28.667
-Not like I had much
of a choice.

65
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.333
-Okay. let's not
get into that again.

66
00:03:31.417 --> 00:03:34.333
-I'm not getting
into anything again.

67
00:03:34.417 --> 00:03:36.125
I mean. if you guys want
your daughter along

68
00:03:36.208 --> 00:03:39.167
on what could've been a romantic
getaway. then that's on you.

69
00:03:39.208 --> 00:03:40.500
-Okay. okay.

70
00:03:40.542 --> 00:03:42.833
We'll have plenty of time
alone this fall

71
00:03:42.875 --> 00:03:44.458
when you're in college.

72
00:03:44.583 --> 00:03:47.417
-Or hopefully you'll make better
choices than you did this year.

73
00:03:49.125 --> 00:03:51.542
-I thought we weren't getting
into that again?

74
00:03:51.667 --> 00:03:52.833
-Hey! Watch out!

75
00:03:52.917 --> 00:03:53.708
-Whoa. whoa. whoa.
-Rabbit!

76
00:03:53.792 --> 00:03:54.833
-Mom!
-Whoa.

77
00:03:54.917 --> 00:03:56.292
-Mom. you can't yell like that.

78
00:03:56.375 --> 00:03:57.542
-Okay. Shh...

79
00:03:57.667 --> 00:04:00.083
-I'm sorry. I didn't know
if you saw it.

81
00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:03.667
-[Sarah] What is he...?

82
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:04.750
-Crap.

83
00:04:04.833 --> 00:04:05.792
-It's okay.

84
00:04:05.875 --> 00:04:07.167
Just. uh... ease up
to the speed limit.

[truck horn honks]

86
00:04:08.208 --> 00:04:09.333
-Okay.

87
00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:11.833
-Just... sweetie. stay calm.

88
00:04:11.875 --> 00:04:12.875
-What is this guy's problem?

00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.792
[truck horn honks]

90
00:04:15.875 --> 00:04:16.958

92
00:04:22.833 --> 00:04:24.250
-Dad.

93
00:04:24.333 --> 00:04:27.000
-What is he doing?
Why didn't he pass us?

94
00:04:27.125 --> 00:04:28.125
-There's nowhere
for me to pull over.

95
00:04:28.208 --> 00:04:30.167
-Okay. Stay calm. sweetie.

96
00:04:30.208 --> 00:04:33.000
He'll pass us when there's
a break to do so.

97
00:04:33.083 --> 00:04:34.250
-[Regan] He's messing with us.

98
00:04:34.333 --> 00:04:35.792
-Alright. there's a turn out
right ahead.

99
00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:36.833
Just go up there. okay?

100
00:04:36.917 --> 00:04:38.500
-Okay.

101

102
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:40.750
Oh my God!

103
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:41.417
-Are you kidding me?

104
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.708
-Okay. Pull over!

105
00:04:45.417 --> 00:04:47.042
-Calm down. calm down.
Go ahead. go ahead.

106
00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:48.792
[truck horn honks]

107
00:04:53.042 --> 00:04:53.833
It's alright.

108
00:04:53.875 --> 00:04:54.917
-He's pulling off too.

109
00:04:57.917 --> 00:04:58.667
-What?

110
00:05:05.333 --> 00:05:06.833
[engine revving]

111
00:05:06.875 --> 00:05:09.917
-Dad. what just happened?

112
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.333
-Are you okay?

113
00:05:11.417 --> 00:05:13.625
-Yeah. no I'm fine.
But what was his problem?

114
00:05:13.708 --> 00:05:16.000
-It's not your fault.
I'll... I'll drive from here.

115
00:05:16.083 --> 00:05:17.667
-Yeah. you drive.
-Gladly.

116
00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.875
I have a new appreciation
for the subway.

117
00:05:25.875 --> 00:05:27.583
-Oh. what now?

118
00:05:27.667 --> 00:05:29.750
-Who knows?
It's probably nothing.

119
00:05:30.792 --> 00:05:31.708
-Hey folks.

120
00:05:31.833 --> 00:05:33.167
-Afternoon.

121
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.042
-Everything okay?

122
00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:35.833
-Uh. yes. Uh...

123
00:05:35.917 --> 00:05:37.167
-I'm Jude.

124
00:05:37.208 --> 00:05:38.625
-Craig Gerard.
nice to meet you.

125
00:05:38.708 --> 00:05:41.000
This is my wife. Sarah.
my daughter. Regan.

126
00:05:41.083 --> 00:05:45.083
We just had a little scare
with an aggressive driver.

127
00:05:45.083 --> 00:05:48.583
-It wasn't just a little scare.
It was serious road rage.

128
00:05:48.667 --> 00:05:50.042
-I'm sorry about that.

129
00:05:50.167 --> 00:05:53.375
-I'm sorry. are you with the
forest service or something?

130
00:05:53.458 --> 00:05:54.958
-Yes ma'am.

131
00:05:55.042 --> 00:05:56.458
-You look a little young.

132
00:05:56.542 --> 00:05:58.333
-Mom! You can't
just say that.

133
00:05:58.458 --> 00:05:59.958
-[chuckles] No. no. no.
It's okay.

134
00:06:00.042 --> 00:06:01.458
I admit I'm a trainee ranger.

135
00:06:01.542 --> 00:06:03.083
but I can take a report on
that driver if you'd like.

136
00:06:03.167 --> 00:06:04.167
-Yes! Yes. we would...

137
00:06:04.208 --> 00:06:05.750
-Oh. no.
No. no. no.

138
00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:08.542
We don't want this to cast a
cloud over our first day here.

139
00:06:08.667 --> 00:06:10.542
-Well. I promise most folks
around here

140
00:06:10.667 --> 00:06:15.333
are pretty easy going.
Not road-ragey at all.

141
00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:16.667
Where y'all from?

142
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:17.667
-Uh... New York.

143
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:18.917
-Oh. you're staying up
at the resort?

144
00:06:19.042 --> 00:06:20.083
-Yeah.

145
00:06:20.167 --> 00:06:21.292
-Sorry. are we free to go now?

146
00:06:21.375 --> 00:06:22.750
-Of course.

147
00:06:22.833 --> 00:06:25.333
I apologize for taking up
your time.

148
00:06:25.417 --> 00:06:27.000
Enjoy your time in
the Big Sky State.

149
00:06:29.667 --> 00:06:31.083
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

150
00:06:33.542 --> 00:06:34.875
-He's just asking us questions.

151
00:06:39.708 --> 00:06:42.042
-Mom!
That was so rude of you.

152
00:06:42.125 --> 00:06:44.917
-It seemed odd.
Didn't it?

153
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.375
Why was he asking
where we were staying?

154
00:06:47.458 --> 00:06:48.542
-I'm sure he was just
keeping tabs

155
00:06:48.542 --> 00:06:50.458
on the tourists in the area.

156
00:06:50.542 --> 00:06:52.333
-And you're one to talk about
interrogating people.

157
00:06:52.417 --> 00:06:53.833
Miss investigative reporter.

158
00:06:53.917 --> 00:06:57.833
-Alright. alright.
I'll... let it go.

159
00:06:57.875 --> 00:07:00.333
-And you just thought
he was cute.

160
00:07:00.417 --> 00:07:01.833
-[scoffs]
Come on. Dad.

161
00:07:03.875 --> 00:07:06.792
[peaceful music]

162
00:07:27.208 --> 00:07:28.333
-[Regan] Wow.

163
00:07:28.417 --> 00:07:29.375
-[Craig laughs]
That's the reaction.

164
00:07:29.458 --> 00:07:30.375
Pretty cool. huh?

165
00:07:30.458 --> 00:07:31.458
-Yeah. You did good. Craig.

166
00:07:31.542 --> 00:07:32.875
-Oh. thank you.

167
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.417
I guess you were right.

168
00:07:34.542 --> 00:07:37.083
one last family vacation
wasn't such a bad idea. Huh?

169
00:07:37.167 --> 00:07:38.125
-[chuckles]

170
00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:39.667
-Let's go in. Come on.

171
00:07:43.333 --> 00:07:45.000
-[Sarah] Oh.

172
00:07:45.083 --> 00:07:47.792
-[Craig chuckles]
-[Sarah] Wow. this is so nice.

173
00:07:47.875 --> 00:07:49.125
-[Regan] Are those antlers real?

174
00:07:49.208 --> 00:07:50.625
-Yup.

175
00:07:50.708 --> 00:07:52.708
Wow.

176
00:07:52.792 --> 00:07:56.333
-Well. well. well.
If it ain't Craig Gerard!

177
00:07:56.417 --> 00:07:59.917
-[chuckles]
-Oh... Jackson Green!

178
00:08:00.042 --> 00:08:01.833
Oh. it has been a while.
Hasn't it?

179
00:08:01.917 --> 00:08:03.583
-Yeah.
-Wow.

180
00:08:03.708 --> 00:08:05.875
-College. right?
About 20 years ago.

181
00:08:05.875 --> 00:08:08.667
-Yeah.
-Jeez.

182
00:08:08.708 --> 00:08:10.042
This is my wife. Sarah.

183
00:08:10.125 --> 00:08:10.750
-Hi.
-Sarah.

184
00:08:10.875 --> 00:08:12.208
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

185
00:08:12.292 --> 00:08:13.333
-And my daughter. Regan.

186
00:08:13.375 --> 00:08:15.208
-Regan. hey.
-Hey.

187
00:08:15.292 --> 00:08:17.542
-Yeah. the trouble this guy used
to get me into. right Craig?

188
00:08:17.625 --> 00:08:18.917
-[laughs]
-Oh. really?

189
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.458
I think it was the other way
around actually.

190
00:08:20.542 --> 00:08:21.958
-I don't know about that.

191
00:08:22.042 --> 00:08:23.417
So. what brings you out
to these parts. huh?

192
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:24.833
-We have some clientele

193
00:08:24.875 --> 00:08:26.833
that have been raving
about this lodge

194
00:08:26.917 --> 00:08:28.750
and the surrounding
national park.

195
00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:29.792
-Mm-hmm.

196
00:08:29.875 --> 00:08:31.167
-Your family was
from these parts. right?

197
00:08:31.167 --> 00:08:32.333
-Yup.

198
00:08:32.458 --> 00:08:34.167
-So is this place yours?

199
00:08:34.292 --> 00:08:35.958
-Uh... yes it is.

200
00:08:36.042 --> 00:08:37.250
-Oh my God.

201
00:08:37.333 --> 00:08:38.458
[both chuckle]

202
00:08:38.542 --> 00:08:39.667
What a small world.

203
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:40.875
-But hey. listen.

204
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.583
Uh... we got a lot of catching
up to do. right?

205
00:08:42.667 --> 00:08:45.333
So... why don't you all get
settled. and then Craig...

206
00:08:45.375 --> 00:08:46.500
we should have a drink.

207
00:08:46.583 --> 00:08:48.000
-Alright. I look forward to it.

208
00:08:48.042 --> 00:08:49.250
-Okay. Me too.

209
00:08:49.333 --> 00:08:51.083
Okay. Uh. go right that way
and they'll help you.

210
00:08:51.167 --> 00:08:52.708
-Thank you.
-Okay.

211
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.042
-It's so quiet here.

212
00:09:03.125 --> 00:09:05.750
-You're gonna sleep like a baby
tonight with no traffic noise.

213
00:09:08.208 --> 00:09:11.167
-Kinda seems like he knew
we were coming.

214
00:09:11.208 --> 00:09:11.958
-Hmm?

215
00:09:13.083 --> 00:09:16.250
-This isn't part of some
elaborate surprise. is it?

216
00:09:16.375 --> 00:09:18.042
You know how much
I hate surprises.

217
00:09:18.125 --> 00:09:21.667
-No surprises.
Just some weird coincidence.

218
00:09:24.208 --> 00:09:27.083
-Oh...

219
00:09:27.167 --> 00:09:30.125
Looks like my purchase already
came in handy.

220
00:09:30.208 --> 00:09:32.083
-Oh... nice one. Mom.

221
00:09:32.167 --> 00:09:33.083
-Thank you.

222
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.333
-You know what?

223
00:09:35.375 --> 00:09:37.500
I'm gonna take Jackson up
on the offer for the drinks.

224
00:09:37.542 --> 00:09:40.250
so if you two ladies don't mind
me ducking out?

225
00:09:40.375 --> 00:09:41.125
-No.

226
00:09:42.042 --> 00:09:43.667
-Why don't you two
go check out the spa?

227
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:44.792
-Ooh. there's a spa?

228
00:09:44.875 --> 00:09:46.458
-Yeah.

229
00:09:46.542 --> 00:09:48.458
-Oh.
That could be a good idea.

230
00:09:48.542 --> 00:09:50.958
We could get facials
or massages.

231
00:09:52.375 --> 00:09:54.167
-You know. actually
I'm good here.

232
00:10:05.417 --> 00:10:08.625
-I was surprised to see your
name pop up on the reservations.

233
00:10:10.792 --> 00:10:12.667
How long have I been trying
to get you come out here?

234
00:10:12.708 --> 00:10:14.417
-[chuckles]
-A while.

235
00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:15.417
-Yeah. well...

236
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.250
[glasses clink]

237
00:10:17.208 --> 00:10:18.583
[both chuckle]

238
00:10:20.792 --> 00:10:22.917
-Oh yeah. that's the good stuff.

239
00:10:24.375 --> 00:10:25.958
Oh...

240
00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:30.000
-Jackson. I wanted to talk
to you about our arrangement.

241
00:10:32.542 --> 00:10:35.125
-Oh. so that's why you didn't
tell me you were coming.

242
00:10:35.125 --> 00:10:39.250
-Well. I wanted to have this
conversation face to face.

243
00:10:39.333 --> 00:10:41.500
I think. uh...

244
00:10:41.542 --> 00:10:43.708
our arrangement has run
its course.

245
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:48.667
-Well things are going well
at the store. aren't they?

246
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:51.167
-Your infusion of cash
got me back on my feet

247
00:10:51.292 --> 00:10:52.458
when I needed it.

248
00:10:52.542 --> 00:10:53.458
-And my advice.

249
00:10:53.542 --> 00:10:55.000
-True. Um...

250
00:10:55.042 --> 00:10:56.500
-Right?

251
00:10:56.583 --> 00:10:59.542
-Expanding the outdoor sporting
gear to include hunting supplies

252
00:10:59.625 --> 00:11:03.125
has. uh. proven more lucrative
than I expected.

253
00:11:03.208 --> 00:11:04.708
-Inside every man
there's a little boy

254
00:11:04.792 --> 00:11:06.375
who used to play cowboys.

255
00:11:06.458 --> 00:11:08.333
even those fancy
Wall Street traders.

256
00:11:08.417 --> 00:11:09.958
-Yeah. I suppose so.

257
00:11:10.042 --> 00:11:11.333
-Yeah. and since you started
referring them here.

258
00:11:11.458 --> 00:11:13.000
they can play for real.
Right?

259
00:11:13.083 --> 00:11:14.458
You give ´em the tools. I give
´em the four-star service

260
00:11:14.542 --> 00:11:15.958
they're accustomed to.

261
00:11:16.042 --> 00:11:17.958
combined with the wilderness
experience they crave.

262
00:11:18.042 --> 00:11:19.917
That's right.
[chuckles]

263
00:11:20.042 --> 00:11:21.708
-I know the sales pitch.
Jackson.

264
00:11:21.792 --> 00:11:25.500
I. um... I just...

265
00:11:25.583 --> 00:11:27.958
I don't think I'm the right
business partner for you.

266
00:11:29.167 --> 00:11:32.917
-Well. I mean...
you know. I get that.

267
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.708
You know. things change.
Right?

268
00:11:38.875 --> 00:11:40.542
I mean. we're a long ways
away from college

269
00:11:40.625 --> 00:11:43.000
when you and I were
thick as thieves. Right?

270
00:11:45.042 --> 00:11:47.667
But you know. out of
all our college crew...

271
00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:51.667
I never thought you and I would
lose touch like we did.

272
00:11:53.792 --> 00:11:56.917
-Well that wasn't on purpose.
you know.

273
00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.417
After what happened
senior year...

274
00:11:58.542 --> 00:11:59.583
-Water under the bridge.

275
00:11:59.667 --> 00:12:00.417
[clears throat]

276
00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:06.000
-Anyway... life happened.

277
00:12:06.083 --> 00:12:08.500
I had to take over
my father's store.

278
00:12:08.583 --> 00:12:09.667
Then I met Sarah.

279
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:10.875
-Yeah.

280
00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.458
-You know. time goes by.

281
00:12:12.542 --> 00:12:14.083
-It sure does.

282
00:12:15.125 --> 00:12:17.417
I understand.

283
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.958
-I'm glad that we got to connect
at the reunion...

284
00:12:21.083 --> 00:12:23.625
because look what it's brought.

285
00:12:23.625 --> 00:12:26.542
A very beneficial relationship.

286
00:12:26.625 --> 00:12:29.250
-That's run its course.

287
00:12:29.333 --> 00:12:32.208
-It doesn't mean we have
to become strangers again.

288
00:12:34.583 --> 00:12:38.750
-So your wife. she...

289
00:12:38.833 --> 00:12:42.125
she doesn't know about our.
uh... arrangement?

290
00:12:45.083 --> 00:12:47.042
-I didn't see any need
to worry her.

291
00:12:47.042 --> 00:12:48.958
-Yeah. Well. I can
understand that.

292
00:12:49.042 --> 00:12:52.542
We men have to protect
our families. right?

293
00:12:52.667 --> 00:12:58.083
So. if you don't want Sarah to
know. then... mum's the word.

294
00:13:00.125 --> 00:13:01.500
-Thank you.

295
00:13:01.583 --> 00:13:03.458
-Yeah. of course.
Of course.

296
00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.833
I'm wondering if maybe
you could do.

297
00:13:07.875 --> 00:13:09.875
well. a small favor
for me in return.

298
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.292
-What is it?

299
00:13:13.375 --> 00:13:15.833
-Just a little delivery to
an important associate of mine.

300
00:13:18.125 --> 00:13:20.000
I'm having dinner
with the mayor tonight.

301
00:13:20.083 --> 00:13:23.208
-Oh.
-And I... can't take it myself.

302
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.917
-So could you do that for me.
Craig?

303
00:13:27.042 --> 00:13:29.000
Just one last thing
so we can. uh...

304
00:13:30.083 --> 00:13:32.375
[paper rips]
...part on good terms?

305
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:33.958
-Of course.

306
00:14:03.625 --> 00:14:06.542
[birds chirping]

307
00:14:13.708 --> 00:14:15.792
-So how's Jackson?

308
00:14:15.875 --> 00:14:17.583
-Huh?

309
00:14:17.667 --> 00:14:19.458
How's Jackson?

310
00:14:19.542 --> 00:14:20.958
Jackson's fine.

311
00:14:23.833 --> 00:14:25.500
-Just catching up on old times?

312
00:14:26.875 --> 00:14:29.833
-Well. yes.
It's been a while.

313
00:14:32.875 --> 00:14:35.625
-Alright. I'm gonna go to bed.

314
00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:37.333
-Oh. thank God.

315
00:14:37.333 --> 00:14:40.167
I didn't wanna be the first
to give in.

316
00:14:40.208 --> 00:14:44.708
But since you displayed
weakness. my only child. go!

317
00:14:44.792 --> 00:14:46.167
-Okay.

318
00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:47.042
[both chuckle]

319
00:14:47.125 --> 00:14:48.750
-Goodnight sweetheart.
-Mm-hmm.

320
00:14:48.833 --> 00:14:49.917
-Goodnight kiddo.

321
00:14:51.125 --> 00:14:52.917
-Goodnight old-timers.

322
00:14:56.292 --> 00:14:57.042
[door shuts]

323
00:14:58.375 --> 00:15:00.125
-What aren't you telling me.
Craig?

324
00:15:02.625 --> 00:15:03.542
-About what?

325
00:15:05.167 --> 00:15:06.667
-[Sarah] What are we really
doing here?

326
00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:09.458
-[Craig] Nothing.

327
00:15:09.542 --> 00:15:10.792
-[Sarah] Don't you think
it's a little weird?

328
00:15:10.875 --> 00:15:12.125
-[Craig] Yes!

329
00:15:12.208 --> 00:15:13.417
We haven't seen each other
in a long time.

330
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.167
-[Sarah] I mean. it's kind of
a coincidence

331
00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:17.667
that we just run into your
buddy from college.

332
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.000
-[Craig] Good coincidence.

333
00:15:19.042 --> 00:15:20.417
-[Sarah ]There's something else
going on.

334
00:15:31.875 --> 00:15:33.958
[crickets chirping]

335
00:15:59.708 --> 00:16:00.458
-Are you following me?

336
00:16:00.542 --> 00:16:01.708
-No! No. no.

337
00:16:01.792 --> 00:16:03.417
I didn't mean to scare you.
I swear.

338
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.625
I'm... I'm Tyler.

339
00:16:05.708 --> 00:16:06.958
-You work here?

340
00:16:07.042 --> 00:16:10.042
-Yeah. Which means I...
I live here too.

341
00:16:10.125 --> 00:16:12.000
At least for the season.

342
00:16:12.083 --> 00:16:13.417
I lead group hikes all day

343
00:16:13.542 --> 00:16:16.333
so that's why I like coming out
here after my shift.

344
00:16:16.417 --> 00:16:18.583
-Well. sorry for interrupting
your solitude.

345
00:16:18.708 --> 00:16:21.958
-Sorry for walking in
a menacing fashion.

346
00:16:22.042 --> 00:16:23.333
[both chuckle]

347
00:16:24.583 --> 00:16:26.000
-I'm Regan.

348
00:16:26.083 --> 00:16:28.000
-Nice to meet you. Regan.

349
00:16:28.042 --> 00:16:30.583
-It's awesome
that you live here.

350
00:16:30.708 --> 00:16:33.500
-Yeah. It's pretty great.

351
00:16:33.583 --> 00:16:35.833
Are you camping out?

352
00:16:35.875 --> 00:16:39.542
-Uh... yeah. I thought
I'd give it a go.

353
00:16:39.625 --> 00:16:43.000
-City girl wanted a night
under the stars. huh?

354
00:16:43.042 --> 00:16:44.542
-How'd you know
I was a city girl?

355
00:16:44.625 --> 00:16:46.667
-Uh... just a hunch.

356
00:16:46.708 --> 00:16:48.083
[laughs]

357
00:16:48.208 --> 00:16:49.417
-Well it's impossible

358
00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.000
to see the stars like this
in New York City.

359
00:16:52.083 --> 00:16:55.000
-Oh! The big city.

360
00:16:55.125 --> 00:16:57.500
-[chuckles]
Yeah. so they say.

361
00:16:57.583 --> 00:16:59.917
-I could show you a camping spot
if you want.

362
00:16:59.917 --> 00:17:00.708
-Really?

363
00:17:00.792 --> 00:17:01.792
-Yeah.

364
00:17:01.875 --> 00:17:03.125
-Yeah. that'd be great.

365
00:17:04.375 --> 00:17:05.625
-See the creek?

366
00:17:06.708 --> 00:17:09.667
So you. uh. follow that north
about 50 yards.

367
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:13.000
There's a little clearing.
I've camped there myself.

368
00:17:13.042 --> 00:17:15.083
You can't miss it.

369
00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:16.625
-Sounds great. thanks.

370
00:17:18.125 --> 00:17:21.292
-Yeah. See you around.
city girl.

371
00:17:21.375 --> 00:17:23.083
-[chuckles]
Yeah. alright.

372
00:17:49.875 --> 00:17:51.792
-What are you doing?

373
00:17:51.792 --> 00:17:53.750
-[sighs]
Just out for a walk.

374
00:17:58.708 --> 00:18:00.583
-It's the middle of the night.

375
00:18:00.667 --> 00:18:02.125
-I couldn't sleep.

376
00:18:03.125 --> 00:18:06.292
-You could sleep through
an earthquake.

377
00:18:06.375 --> 00:18:07.792
[sighs]

378
00:18:15.417 --> 00:18:19.458
I thought we were really
gonna try on this trip.

379
00:18:19.542 --> 00:18:22.042
That means you have
to talk to me.

380
00:18:22.167 --> 00:18:25.042
-I understand that
but this isn't about us.

381
00:18:25.125 --> 00:18:26.792
-Well. what's it about?

382
00:18:28.042 --> 00:18:30.667
-I have to do a... a favor
for Jackson.

383
00:18:31.917 --> 00:18:32.792
-Jackson?

384
00:18:34.417 --> 00:18:37.333
The owner of this lodge who
you haven't seen since college.

385
00:18:37.375 --> 00:18:39.625
who I've never met
until today?

386
00:18:41.542 --> 00:18:43.167
Oh. I see.

387
00:18:46.875 --> 00:18:49.333
This is about business.
Isn't it?

388
00:18:49.375 --> 00:18:50.875
-God...

389
00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:54.458
-You wanted me to think that you
found this place on your own.

390
00:18:54.542 --> 00:18:57.042
Some place that I would love.
some place that...

391
00:18:57.125 --> 00:18:58.500
that would be good for us.

392
00:18:58.625 --> 00:19:03.708
But this is just a place where
you could get a good deal.

393
00:19:03.792 --> 00:19:06.750
Or do some new deal.

394
00:19:06.833 --> 00:19:08.167
-It's not that.

395
00:19:10.833 --> 00:19:12.625
-This trip was never about us.

396
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.667
-Sarah. I'm here for you.

397
00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:20.292
What does it matter
how I found the place

398
00:19:20.375 --> 00:19:22.250
or if I know the owner?

399
00:19:22.333 --> 00:19:24.042
-Because you lied about it.

400
00:19:24.125 --> 00:19:25.542
-Really?

401
00:19:26.333 --> 00:19:28.833
Well I didn't mean to.

402
00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:30.583
I was embarrassed. okay?

403
00:19:32.167 --> 00:19:33.292
I mean. look at the place.

404
00:19:33.292 --> 00:19:34.792
I could never compete
with Jackson.

405
00:19:36.792 --> 00:19:38.125
-[sighs]

406
00:19:43.458 --> 00:19:45.833
So... what's this
mysterious favor?

407
00:19:45.875 --> 00:19:49.250
-I have to deliver some
documents to a colleague.

408
00:19:49.333 --> 00:19:50.917
-Doesn't he have staff for that?

409
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.125
-I don't know.
I didn't ask.

410
00:19:53.208 --> 00:19:55.000
-And you decided to make
this delivery

411
00:19:55.042 --> 00:19:57.375
in the middle of the night.

412
00:19:57.458 --> 00:19:59.792
When you knew that you could
keep it a secret from me.

413
00:19:59.875 --> 00:20:01.208
Got it.

414
00:20:01.292 --> 00:20:02.958
-Sarah. this doesn't have
to ruin anything.

415
00:20:03.042 --> 00:20:05.167
It's a quick errand.

416
00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:07.583
-But I don't understand
why he needs you to do it.

417
00:20:07.667 --> 00:20:10.667
-Maybe you don't need
to understand!

418
00:20:10.708 --> 00:20:12.000
You don't have the right

419
00:20:12.042 --> 00:20:13.875
to every detail of other
people's lives.

420
00:20:13.958 --> 00:20:15.250
-I never said I did.

421
00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:19.583
-Yet you look at everything.
I mean everything.

422
00:20:19.708 --> 00:20:22.167
like it's a news story
you need to uncover.

423
00:20:25.083 --> 00:20:26.167
-Fine.

424
00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:28.333
He's your friend.
you trust him.

425
00:20:28.417 --> 00:20:30.250
I will not ask any
more questions.

426
00:20:30.375 --> 00:20:31.583
-Thank you.

427
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.625
-But I'm coming with you.

428
00:20:34.708 --> 00:20:35.667
-No. Sarah...

429
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:37.208
-What?

430
00:20:37.292 --> 00:20:38.833
We're supposed to be spending
time together.

431
00:20:38.917 --> 00:20:40.542
-[sighs]

432
00:20:40.667 --> 00:20:43.583
-So... we can do a little
stargazing.

433
00:20:44.542 --> 00:20:45.875
-[laughs]

434
00:20:47.667 --> 00:20:49.250
Stargaze?

435
00:20:49.333 --> 00:20:50.750
-I'll go get dressed.

436
00:20:51.958 --> 00:20:54.833

[thunder rumbles]

439
00:21:19.708 --> 00:21:23.167
This. uh. colleague of Jackson's
sure lives off the beaten path.

440
00:21:23.333 --> 00:21:25.042
-I guess that's why
he didn't have time

441
00:21:25.125 --> 00:21:28.500
to come out here himself.

442
00:21:28.542 --> 00:21:29.625
-Right.

443
00:21:35.167 --> 00:21:37.417
Well. my signal's totally dead.

444
00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.583
-I have a couple bars.
don't worry.

445
00:21:40.667 --> 00:21:44.875
According to the directions.
the turn out is right ahead.

446
00:21:54.042 --> 00:21:56.042
-This can't be the place.

447
00:21:56.167 --> 00:21:57.458
-Must be.

448
00:21:59.542 --> 00:22:01.625
You just wait here.
I'll only be a minute.

449
00:22:17.917 --> 00:22:20.375
-Who the hell are you?

450
00:22:20.375 --> 00:22:23.958
-Uh... Jackson said you'd be
expecting a delivery.

451
00:22:24.042 --> 00:22:26.292
-Okay then. Give it here.

452
00:22:32.208 --> 00:22:35.292
[dramatic music]

453
00:22:46.125 --> 00:22:47.792
-What the hell?

454
00:22:54.208 --> 00:22:57.458
-He also said you might have
something to send back to him?

455
00:22:59.042 --> 00:23:00.750
-Hold on a minute.

456
00:23:06.042 --> 00:23:07.542
Why don't you step inside?

457
00:23:07.625 --> 00:23:10.083
I'll write a quick note.
take it back with you.

458
00:23:10.875 --> 00:23:11.625
-Uh...

459
00:23:12.583 --> 00:23:13.667
-Craig.

460
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:14.625
-Okay.

461
00:23:16.375 --> 00:23:18.083
-Craig!

-[screams]
No!

464
00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:26.000
-Do as I say or
I'll slice his throat

465
00:23:26.083 --> 00:23:28.292
before you take another step.

466
00:23:28.375 --> 00:23:30.875
Step towards me.

467
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.333
-Okay.
-Nice and slow.

468
00:23:33.375 --> 00:23:35.167
-[grunts]
-We don't want any trouble.

469
00:23:35.208 --> 00:23:38.667
Call Jackson. this is just
a big misunderstanding.

470
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:40.000
-Shut up.

471
00:23:40.042 --> 00:23:43.833
-Please. we promise not
to say anything to anybody.

472
00:23:43.875 --> 00:23:45.625
-I just told you to keep
your mouth shut

473
00:23:45.708 --> 00:23:47.125
and you're still talking.

474
00:23:47.208 --> 00:23:48.042

Craig.

478
00:24:05.208 --> 00:24:06.333
Craig!

479
00:24:06.417 --> 00:24:07.458
Wake up!

480
00:24:08.792 --> 00:24:09.667

Oh come on. come on.
come on.

484

-I need to see you right now.

485
00:24:44.625 --> 00:24:46.125
You know the place.

488
00:25:00.292 --> 00:25:03.458
-You do not call me unless
it's absolutely critical.

489
00:25:03.542 --> 00:25:09.167
-I know the damn rules.
Another one. no surprises.

490
00:25:09.208 --> 00:25:10.458
-Oh. come on.

491
00:25:10.542 --> 00:25:11.500
Don't tell me you couldn't
handle Craig.

492
00:25:11.625 --> 00:25:13.333
-Handling him
would've been fine.

493
00:25:13.417 --> 00:25:15.917
It's when his old lady
come screeching up.

494
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.125
things took a turn.

495
00:25:19.833 --> 00:25:21.625
-Well. that's unfortunate.

496
00:25:21.708 --> 00:25:24.417
-Unfortunate for you.

497
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:25.500
-Excuse me?

498
00:25:25.542 --> 00:25:27.750
-These are special
circumstances.

499
00:25:27.833 --> 00:25:29.583
I've never killed
a woman before.

500
00:25:29.708 --> 00:25:31.292
-Oh. come on.
Don't get principled on me now.

501
00:25:31.417 --> 00:25:33.333
-It's not a matter of principle.

502
00:25:33.458 --> 00:25:35.333
It's about price.

503
00:25:35.375 --> 00:25:37.542
-Okay. Alright.

504
00:25:37.625 --> 00:25:38.792
-I'm thinking double.

505
00:25:38.875 --> 00:25:40.083
-Oh. come on.
Now listen...

506
00:25:40.208 --> 00:25:41.583
-No. you listen to me.

507
00:25:41.667 --> 00:25:45.000
For once. I figure I got
the upper hand.

508
00:25:45.083 --> 00:25:49.167
If this whole setup goes south.
I can disappear.

509
00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:53.375
But you?
You got a lot to lose.

510

538
00:30:35.292 --> 00:30:37.500
-Okay. pretend like you're
unconscious. Okay?

539
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:38.333
-Okay.

540
00:30:46.375 --> 00:30:47.792
-Who's Regan?

541
00:30:49.042 --> 00:30:53.958
-Regan is our daughter.
She's in New York.

542
00:30:54.042 --> 00:30:55.958
She's probably just checking in.

543
00:30:59.167 --> 00:31:02.250
-Well I guess little girl's
gonna have to get by on her own.

544

[thud]

545
00:31:13.083 --> 00:31:15.750
-Hi. Um. were there any messages
left for me today?

546
00:31:15.833 --> 00:31:17.042
Regan Gerard.

547
00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:20.500
-Sorry. I don't see anything.

548
00:31:20.542 --> 00:31:22.000
-Um... okay.

549
00:31:22.083 --> 00:31:23.833
Were there any morning
activities or anything like that

550
00:31:23.875 --> 00:31:26.292

Cabin 32.

[keyboard clacks]

552
00:31:30.042 --> 00:31:32.250
-I'm not seeing anything.

553
00:31:32.333 --> 00:31:34.417
Um... did you wanna
book anything?

554
00:31:34.542 --> 00:31:36.542
We have mountain bikes for rent.

555
00:31:36.667 --> 00:31:38.625
-Uh. no. That's... no.
that's okay.

556
00:31:38.708 --> 00:31:42.667
Um... just one last question.

557
00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:44.000
Have you seen either
of these people

558
00:31:44.083 --> 00:31:45.792
come through the lodge
at all today?

559
00:31:45.792 --> 00:31:48.833
-Sorry. No. not today.

560
00:31:48.958 --> 00:31:50.875
-Okay. uh... thanks.

-[sighs]

562
00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:08.125
Dammit.

563
00:32:08.208 --> 00:32:09.000
-What?

564
00:32:09.083 --> 00:32:10.250
-He locked the door.

565
00:32:10.375 --> 00:32:12.167
I got outside last night
but he locked it.

566
00:32:13.792 --> 00:32:16.042
-Oh my God. What have I
got us into?

567
00:32:16.042 --> 00:32:17.542
-Do you remember that story.

568
00:32:17.625 --> 00:32:20.000
that story that I covered in
Asia about the tiger poaching?

569
00:32:20.042 --> 00:32:22.042
These are the same tools.

570
00:32:22.125 --> 00:32:23.625
These are the same tools
poachers use

571
00:32:23.708 --> 00:32:25.500
to work the animal hides.

572
00:32:25.583 --> 00:32:28.708
And. and... these cages.
and the ones outside...

573
00:32:28.792 --> 00:32:29.833
-I saw those too.

574
00:32:29.875 --> 00:32:31.417
-Yeah.

575
00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:34.333
That envelope you delivered.
it was full of client info.

576
00:32:34.417 --> 00:32:38.167
All hard copies. no electronic
records. Okay?

577
00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:40.417
Your... your friend Jackson
is a poacher

578
00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:43.333
and that client list was a list
of all these rich people

579
00:32:43.458 --> 00:32:46.000
that wanna hunt
endangered animals.

Probably. I don't know.
wolves in this area.

581
00:32:48.375 --> 00:32:50.167
And this lunatic
is the same guy

582
00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:52.000
that ran us off the road
yesterday.

583
00:32:52.125 --> 00:32:54.958
-I can't believe this is
happening to us.

584
00:32:55.042 --> 00:32:59.958
-I need you to not panic
right now. Okay?

585
00:33:00.042 --> 00:33:03.125
-Sarah. I can't believe Jackson
would try and...

586
00:33:03.208 --> 00:33:05.500
-I don't give a crap
about Jackson right now.

587
00:33:05.583 --> 00:33:07.875
You need to focus on
getting out of here

588
00:33:07.958 --> 00:33:09.667
so we can get to our daughter
before they do.

589
00:33:09.792 --> 00:33:11.167
Do you understand?

590
00:33:11.208 --> 00:33:13.750
-Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay.

591
00:33:13.833 --> 00:33:14.667
-[sighs]

592
00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.750
-[voicemail] Hi. this is Sarah.
You know what to do.

-[sighs] God.

594
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.250
Okay. you guys have been
gone for hours.

595
00:33:34.333 --> 00:33:36.083
If you're trying to teach me
some kind of lesson

596
00:33:36.167 --> 00:33:38.375
by disappearing all day.
it's not funny.

597
00:33:38.458 --> 00:33:41.125
Can you call me back?
Please? Now.

598
00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:59.667
Hi. Um...
I wanted to check

599
00:33:59.708 --> 00:34:02.708
if there were any car accidents
that happened last night

600
00:34:02.792 --> 00:34:06.583
or any man or woman
that might've been admitted

601
00:34:06.708 --> 00:34:08.208
to the hospital today.

602
00:34:12.958 --> 00:34:15.667
No. Okay.

603
00:34:16.917 --> 00:34:20.833
And there's nobody there by
the name of Craig Gerard or...

604
00:34:20.875 --> 00:34:22.250
or Sarah Gerard?

605
00:34:28.792 --> 00:34:30.542
Okay. Thank you.

606
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:38.875
-Hello again.

607
00:34:38.958 --> 00:34:40.417
-Uh. still no messages for me?

608
00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:42.458
-No. sorry.

609
00:34:42.542 --> 00:34:44.708
-Can I rent one of those
bicycles that you mentioned?

610
00:34:44.792 --> 00:34:46.292
-Of course. Miss Gerard.

611
00:34:51.417 --> 00:34:53.250
-You need to see to our guests'

612
00:34:53.333 --> 00:34:56.167

immediately.

Get a grip. Regan.

616
00:35:48.417 --> 00:35:49.292
Okay.

617
00:36:01.292 --> 00:36:04.667
-Hello young lady.
How can I help you?

618
00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:06.833
-Do rangers help when people
are missing?

619
00:36:08.542 --> 00:36:10.667
-You know someone who's gone
missing in the forest?

620
00:36:10.708 --> 00:36:12.042
-Maybe.

621
00:36:12.125 --> 00:36:13.208
I'm staying with my parents
at the resort

622
00:36:13.333 --> 00:36:15.333
and they've been gone
all morning.

623

[door squeaks]

624
00:36:17.583 --> 00:36:21.000
-Hi. The girl who battled
road rage.

625
00:36:21.083 --> 00:36:22.833
Regan. right?

626
00:36:22.875 --> 00:36:23.875
-Yeah. right.

627
00:36:26.208 --> 00:36:29.042
-She says her parents
might be missing.

628
00:36:29.167 --> 00:36:30.500
-Oh. what happened?

629
00:36:31.875 --> 00:36:33.333
-I don't know.

630
00:36:33.458 --> 00:36:34.625
They weren't in the cabin
when I got back this morning

631
00:36:34.708 --> 00:36:36.667
and they're not answering
their phones.

632
00:36:36.708 --> 00:36:38.500
No calls. texts.

633
00:36:38.583 --> 00:36:42.542
-What time did you notice
them gone?

634
00:36:42.667 --> 00:36:44.625
-Around 7:00 AM.

635
00:36:44.708 --> 00:36:46.458
-And where were you
before that?

636
00:36:46.542 --> 00:36:48.167
-I camped out last night.

637
00:36:48.292 --> 00:36:50.500
-Alone?

638
00:36:50.625 --> 00:36:51.375
-Yes.

639
00:36:52.708 --> 00:36:54.667
-Then don't you think
it's likely

640
00:36:54.792 --> 00:36:57.375
they're looking for you
right now?

641
00:36:57.458 --> 00:36:59.958
-Yeah. but they haven't
even tried to call me.

642
00:37:00.042 --> 00:37:02.667
I mean. my mom would never be
without her phone.

643
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:06.000
-I mean. maybe they've tried
calling because...

644
00:37:06.083 --> 00:37:08.833
reception out here
is pretty shoddy.

645
00:37:08.958 --> 00:37:10.167
-Yeah. it's not like them.

646
00:37:10.208 --> 00:37:12.292
They didn't leave a note
or anything. and...

647
00:37:12.375 --> 00:37:13.833
I don't know. I feel like
something's wrong.

648
00:37:13.875 --> 00:37:16.875
-Okay. Okay. Okay.

649
00:37:16.958 --> 00:37:20.000
I have a feeling your parents
will be back any moment.

650
00:37:20.042 --> 00:37:24.833
But if they're not. you call me.
I'll call the Sheriff

651
00:37:24.917 --> 00:37:28.000
and have a missing
person's report filed.

652
00:37:28.042 --> 00:37:30.542
-Maybe I can go up to the resort
and help her find her parents.

653
00:37:30.625 --> 00:37:32.708
-You've got work here.

654
00:37:32.792 --> 00:37:35.792
But I promise. we'll help
when the time comes.

655
00:37:37.292 --> 00:37:42.333
But... I bet your parents turn
up on their own any time now.

656
00:37:46.667 --> 00:37:49.833
-There has to be something sharp
enough that can cut this rope.

657
00:37:49.917 --> 00:37:52.958
-I know. I know.
I'm looking. I'm looking.

658
00:37:53.042 --> 00:37:55.375
I can't believe I left my knife
out there last night.

Wait.

664
00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:16.833
Wait a second. I...

665
00:38:16.875 --> 00:38:18.458
I saw a guy do this once
when we were in the bush.

666
00:38:18.542 --> 00:38:20.333
Maybe this will work.

00:40:28.583 --> 00:40:29.708
-Sarah. watch out.

713
00:40:29.833 --> 00:40:31.083
-Oh my God!
He's getting on my side.

714
00:40:31.208 --> 00:40:32.250
-Don't let him get there!

715
00:40:32.333 --> 00:40:33.542
-I can't!

716
00:40:33.667 --> 00:40:34.875
-Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa!
-[tires squeal]

717
00:40:40.208 --> 00:40:41.333
-[panting]
-Are you okay?

718
00:40:41.375 --> 00:40:44.292
-Yeah. I think so.
How about you?

719
00:40:44.375 --> 00:40:45.667
-Yeah.

720
00:40:47.125 --> 00:40:48.208
I just... I...

721
00:40:48.375 --> 00:40:49.458
-Come on.

722
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.042
-Oh my God. we gotta go.

723
00:40:52.167 --> 00:40:55.000
-You think you know these
woods better than me?

724
00:40:55.708 --> 00:40:56.875
-He's got another arrow.
come on!

725
00:40:58.375 --> 00:40:59.333

-[thud]

726
00:40:59.375 --> 00:41:00.167
[both gasp]

727
00:41:02.583 --> 00:41:04.167
-Trees are thicker this way.
we can lose him.

728
00:41:04.292 --> 00:41:05.042
-Okay.

729
00:41:08.375 --> 00:41:09.250
-[arrow whistles]
-[thud]

730
00:41:09.333 --> 00:41:10.167
[screams]
Ahhhh!!!!

731
00:41:11.375 --> 00:41:13.500
Sarah. Sarah!

732
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.833
-Oh my God.

733
00:41:15.917 --> 00:41:16.958
Craig?

734
00:41:17.042 --> 00:41:19.042
Oh my God!
We have to keep going.

735
00:41:23.042 --> 00:41:25.917
[dramatic music]

736
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.167
-Hey! City girl.

737
00:41:33.208 --> 00:41:34.208
-Hey.

738
00:41:34.292 --> 00:41:35.875
-How'd that camping spot
work out?

739
00:41:35.958 --> 00:41:39.000
-Oh yeah. it was really pretty.
Thanks.

740
00:41:39.083 --> 00:41:40.542
-Is everything okay?

741
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.292
-I just... I can't seem
to find my parents.

742
00:41:45.375 --> 00:41:48.083
-Yeah. it's a big place.

743
00:41:48.167 --> 00:41:53.292
-No. it's not that. It's...
they've been gone all morning

744
00:41:53.292 --> 00:41:55.542
and they're not answering
any of my calls. and...

745
00:41:55.667 --> 00:41:57.125
I don't know what to do.

746
00:41:57.208 --> 00:41:59.167
-I'm sure they'll turn up.

747
00:41:59.208 --> 00:42:01.583
-Yeah. you sound exactly
like the rangers.

748
00:42:01.708 --> 00:42:03.292
-Wait. you talked
to the rangers?

749
00:42:03.375 --> 00:42:04.667
-Yeah. They told me to.
you know.

750
00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:07.667
keep waiting for them
to turn up but...

751
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:10.292
they wouldn't just disappear
on me like this and...

752
00:42:10.375 --> 00:42:13.500
trust me. you don't know
my mother.

753
00:42:13.625 --> 00:42:15.958
I'm really worried something
is wrong.

754
00:42:17.625 --> 00:42:19.917
And nobody will listen
to me. so...

755
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000
-I'm so sorry. I didn't know
it was that serious.

756
00:42:23.042 --> 00:42:24.917
-It's alright.
How could you know?

757
00:42:25.042 --> 00:42:27.792
-Hey. uh... it's gonna be
okay. Alright?

758
00:42:27.875 --> 00:42:30.167
Why don't we go talk
to my uncle?

759
00:42:30.208 --> 00:42:31.250
-Who's your uncle?

760
00:42:31.333 --> 00:42:32.625
-He owns the resort.

761
00:42:32.708 --> 00:42:33.917
-What. really?

762
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.167
-Yeah. He'll know what to do.

763
00:42:36.292 --> 00:42:37.417
Can I take your bike?

764
00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:39.250
-Uh... yeah. Thank you.

765
00:42:39.333 --> 00:42:40.917
-Yeah. no problem.

766
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.000
-Thanks.

767
00:42:43.708 --> 00:42:45.583
So. what do you think?

768
00:42:45.667 --> 00:42:47.792
-Hmm. What do I think?

769
00:42:47.875 --> 00:42:53.042
Well... I don't agree
with the rangers on much

770
00:42:53.167 --> 00:42:56.458
but. uh. I think they might
be right.

771
00:42:56.542 --> 00:42:57.792
And if I know your dad.

772
00:42:57.875 --> 00:42:59.083
I'm sure the moment he found out
you were gone

773
00:42:59.208 --> 00:43:01.417
he probably ran off
to try to find you.

774
00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:04.167
But unfortunately outsiders
bite off more than they can chew

775
00:43:04.292 --> 00:43:05.750
when it comes to the forest.

776
00:43:05.833 --> 00:43:07.083
They... you know.
they get turned around.

777
00:43:07.167 --> 00:43:08.625
they lose cell phone
reception. they...

778
00:43:08.708 --> 00:43:09.708
-Yeah. but it's been...

779
00:43:09.833 --> 00:43:11.250
-No. Uh. uh. uh...

780
00:43:11.333 --> 00:43:12.625
Let me finish.

781
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.875
Now having said that. it's
always better to worry sooner

782
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.333
and feel silly later than
to wait too long. Right?

783
00:43:21.417 --> 00:43:22.583
So here's what I'm gonna do.

784
00:43:22.708 --> 00:43:24.000
I'm gonna get those rangers
on the phone.

785
00:43:24.042 --> 00:43:26.042
and we're gonna get to the
bottom of this. Alright?

786
00:43:26.167 --> 00:43:27.708
I promise you that.

787
00:43:28.583 --> 00:43:29.583
-[sighs]
Thank you.

788
00:43:29.667 --> 00:43:31.042
Thank you so much.

789
00:43:31.958 --> 00:43:33.875
-Do you have the...
the card?

790
00:43:33.958 --> 00:43:36.292
-Uh...
-That. uh. he gave you?

791
00:43:36.375 --> 00:43:37.792
-Yes. Of course.

792
00:43:42.208 --> 00:43:42.958
-[sighs]

793
00:43:44.667 --> 00:43:47.458
Okay. So. uh. here's what's
gonna happen.

794
00:43:47.542 --> 00:43:50.875
Tyler's gonna stick with you
´till we sort this out. Okay?

795
00:43:50.958 --> 00:43:54.917
And if you need anything.
anything at all. he'll help.

796
00:43:57.167 --> 00:43:58.125
-Are you sure?

797
00:43:58.208 --> 00:43:59.208
-Of course.

798
00:44:00.958 --> 00:44:04.333
-Okay. Thank you both.

799
00:44:04.417 --> 00:44:07.208
-Of course.
Get outta here.

800
00:44:07.208 --> 00:44:08.333
Try and have some fun.

801
00:44:29.375 --> 00:44:32.625
[both breathing heavily]

802
00:44:32.708 --> 00:44:35.833
-I... I... I don't think I can
go much longer on this leg.

803
00:44:35.958 --> 00:44:38.458
-Okay. It's probably because
your adrenaline's wearing off.

804
00:44:38.542 --> 00:44:39.375
-[groans]

805
00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:40.667
-You gotta sit down.

806
00:44:40.792 --> 00:44:42.958
[panting]

807
00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:47.292
-[wincing]

808
00:44:47.375 --> 00:44:48.708
-Here. let me check it.

809
00:44:50.375 --> 00:44:53.500
It looks like it went
straight through.

810
00:44:53.667 --> 00:44:54.958
Doesn't look like it hit
an artery though.

811
00:44:55.042 --> 00:44:56.667
there'd be way more blood.

812
00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:58.500
-Are you gonna pull it out?

813
00:44:58.542 --> 00:45:00.958
-I don't want to. but... I don't
know how you're gonna...

814
00:45:01.042 --> 00:45:04.792
keep going with it sticking
straight out like that.

815
00:45:04.792 --> 00:45:07.292
-We have arrows like this
at the store.

816
00:45:07.375 --> 00:45:08.750
The tip is a screw-on.

817
00:45:08.833 --> 00:45:11.125
you can... you can
take it off.

818
00:45:11.208 --> 00:45:12.250
-Okay.

819
00:45:12.333 --> 00:45:13.333
-Just go slow.

820
00:45:13.417 --> 00:45:14.250
-Okay.
-Oh!

821
00:45:18.167 --> 00:45:19.208
-I got it.

822
00:45:20.125 --> 00:45:21.500
I'm gonna have to pull it out.

823
00:45:21.583 --> 00:45:22.417
-Alright.

824
00:45:26.875 --> 00:45:31.292
-I need something to...
I need something to put over it.

825
00:45:32.917 --> 00:45:37.000
Something to tighten it.
to cover it.

826
00:45:37.042 --> 00:45:39.167
I think if I come over here
I got a better angle.

827
00:45:39.208 --> 00:45:40.958
-[groaning]
Okay! Okay!

828
00:45:41.042 --> 00:45:42.083
Oh!

829
00:45:42.167 --> 00:45:44.250
-I'm sorry. Okay.
This is gonna hurt.

830
00:45:44.375 --> 00:45:45.000
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

831
00:45:45.042 --> 00:45:46.667
-One...
-Mm-hmm.

832
00:45:46.708 --> 00:45:49.833
-Two... three!
-[muffled screams]

833
00:45:49.875 --> 00:45:51.792
-Okay. Okay.

834
00:45:55.167 --> 00:45:58.875
I'm sorry.
I gotta tie this.

835
00:45:58.958 --> 00:46:00.042
-[exertion grunts]

836
00:46:03.625 --> 00:46:05.375
-It's gotta be tight.
-I know.

837
00:46:06.167 --> 00:46:07.167
-There.

838
00:46:07.208 --> 00:46:08.917
-[deep inhale]

839
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.667
-Okay. Now take
a deep breath.

840
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:14.208
-[breathing heavily]

841
00:46:17.958 --> 00:46:20.417
How far is the car
from here?

842
00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:22.792
-I don't know.
A few miles?

843
00:46:25.083 --> 00:46:29.875
-If we go back in that direction
we'll find the road. right?

844
00:46:29.958 --> 00:46:32.583
If he's not following us.

845
00:46:32.583 --> 00:46:33.500
-Yeah.

846
00:46:35.875 --> 00:46:37.458
-[branch cracks]
-What was that?

847
00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:40.375
-We gotta keep moving.
Come on.

848
00:46:40.458 --> 00:46:41.500
-Okay.
-Here we go.

849
00:46:43.208 --> 00:46:44.167
-Ahhh!!!

850
00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:45.875
[wincing]

851
00:46:48.417 --> 00:46:49.917
-Come on.

852
00:46:55.458 --> 00:46:57.708
-So... how long have you been
working for your uncle?

853
00:46:57.792 --> 00:46:59.667
-Several years. on and off.

854
00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:02.333
Summer breaks when I was in high
school and now it's full time.

855
00:47:02.375 --> 00:47:04.500
-Are you learning
the family business?

856
00:47:04.583 --> 00:47:07.708
-Actually. at first it was a way
to keep me outta trouble.

857
00:47:07.833 --> 00:47:09.625
-[chuckles]
Oh. is that so?

858
00:47:09.708 --> 00:47:11.958
-Yeah. Uh. believe it or not

859
00:47:12.042 --> 00:47:13.792
I used to be a bit of
a juvenile delinquent.

860
00:47:13.875 --> 00:47:15.958
So my parents started
sending me here.

861
00:47:16.042 --> 00:47:18.042
hoping the work would
set me straight.

862
00:47:18.125 --> 00:47:19.458
-Seems like it worked.

863
00:47:19.542 --> 00:47:20.333
-It did.

864
00:47:23.708 --> 00:47:25.458
-No way.

865
00:47:25.542 --> 00:47:27.250
-What?
-Oh my...

866
00:47:27.333 --> 00:47:32.208
My mom promised she wouldn't
bring this on vacation

867
00:47:32.208 --> 00:47:34.167
but I should've known to look
for it immediately.

868
00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:35.750
-You know your mom's password?

869
00:47:35.833 --> 00:47:37.000
-Um... yeah.

870
00:47:37.042 --> 00:47:39.792
Let's not tell her that
when we find her.

871
00:47:39.875 --> 00:47:42.417
-What are we looking for?

872
00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:44.667
-Um... all of her devices
are connected.

873
00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:46.792
so if she has
her phone on her.

874
00:47:46.875 --> 00:47:49.542
and the device tracking app
is working...

875
00:47:49.625 --> 00:47:50.958
Yes! Right there. look.

876
00:47:51.042 --> 00:47:52.250
-Yeah. I know right
where that is.

877
00:47:52.375 --> 00:47:53.333
-Okay.

878
00:47:53.458 --> 00:47:54.458
-I'll let my uncle know.

879
00:47:54.542 --> 00:47:56.167
-No. I...

880
00:47:56.292 --> 00:47:58.250
I don't wanna keep explaining
myself to men over and over

881
00:47:58.333 --> 00:48:01.833
that won't listen to me
or do anything.

882
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:02.917
No offense.

883
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.500
-None taken.

884
00:48:04.625 --> 00:48:05.667
-Can you take me?

885
00:48:05.708 --> 00:48:07.125
-Yeah. Let's go.

886
00:48:13.958 --> 00:48:15.125
-Do you see anything?

887
00:48:15.208 --> 00:48:16.125
-No.

888
00:48:18.667 --> 00:48:20.333
-Ugh. No.

889
00:48:20.417 --> 00:48:22.208
-What? What is it?

890
00:48:22.292 --> 00:48:24.750
-My phone just lost reception.

891
00:48:24.875 --> 00:48:26.833
My mom and I are on
the same plan. so...

892
00:48:26.917 --> 00:48:28.042
this is probably just
the last place

893
00:48:28.125 --> 00:48:29.667
that her phone had service.

894
00:48:34.167 --> 00:48:35.208
Mom?

895
00:48:36.333 --> 00:48:37.458
Dad?

896
00:48:38.333 --> 00:48:39.542
-What about your
dad's phone?

897
00:48:39.625 --> 00:48:41.333
-He's on a different plan
than us for work.

898
00:48:44.042 --> 00:48:45.792
-Hey. maybe we should head
back to the resort.

899
00:48:45.875 --> 00:48:49.000
I mean. if they try to call you.
you can be in service range.

900
00:48:49.125 --> 00:48:50.250
-Can't we just go a little
bit further?

901
00:48:50.333 --> 00:48:51.917
Maybe their car's
out there somewhere.

902
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.250
-Regan. the forest is huge.

903
00:48:54.375 --> 00:48:56.333
-Yeah. but you know this place.
Right?

904
00:48:56.333 --> 00:48:57.667
-Yeah.

905
00:48:57.708 --> 00:49:00.750
Any expert would tell you that
going too deep into the forest.

906
00:49:00.833 --> 00:49:04.083
without a plan.
is not a good idea.

907
00:49:05.292 --> 00:49:07.167
-I mean. at least we can give
this location to your uncle

908
00:49:07.208 --> 00:49:09.125
to help narrow down
the search area. Right?

909
00:49:09.208 --> 00:49:11.125
-Yeah. Yeah. it's a good point.

910
00:49:12.667 --> 00:49:13.583
Right.

911
00:49:25.042 --> 00:49:26.250
[car shuts off]

912
00:49:26.333 --> 00:49:28.083
-Well. thanks for coming
out there with me.

913
00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:30.375
-Do you want me to come in?

914
00:49:32.083 --> 00:49:33.958
-Uh... no. That's okay.

915
00:49:34.042 --> 00:49:35.667
I think I just wanna be alone
for a while.

916
00:49:37.958 --> 00:49:39.208
-I'll tell my uncle
about the signal

917
00:49:39.292 --> 00:49:42.125
and ask if anyone's
heard anything.

918
00:49:44.167 --> 00:49:45.625
Are you sure you're okay?

919
00:49:50.125 --> 00:49:53.875
-Yeah. I just...
things haven't been

920
00:49:53.958 --> 00:49:57.708
so great between me
and my parents recently.

921
00:49:57.792 --> 00:50:00.500
Especially me and my mom.

922
00:50:00.542 --> 00:50:02.667
She doesn't really
trust me anymore.

923
00:50:02.792 --> 00:50:04.042
-Why not?

924
00:50:06.708 --> 00:50:12.167
-Um... I made some mistakes.

925
00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:15.083
Over spring break my friends
wanted to throw this party.

926
00:50:15.167 --> 00:50:17.833
and I knew it was
a bad idea.

927
00:50:17.917 --> 00:50:19.750
Because I knew
that getting in trouble

928
00:50:19.833 --> 00:50:24.042
could jeopardize college.
my future... everything.

929
00:50:24.167 --> 00:50:25.708
-But you went along
with it anyway.

930
00:50:28.542 --> 00:50:30.625
-Yeah. I did.

931
00:50:30.708 --> 00:50:32.458
And it got out of control

932
00:50:32.542 --> 00:50:34.333
because people we didn't even
know were showing up.

933
00:50:34.417 --> 00:50:37.375
and all of these older guys
with so much alcohol.

934
00:50:37.458 --> 00:50:39.000
and I knew something
was gonna go wrong

935
00:50:39.083 --> 00:50:41.833
or someone was
gonna get hurt.

936
00:50:41.875 --> 00:50:43.208
-What happened?

937
00:50:44.625 --> 00:50:46.333
-Uh. everybody knows
that the cops came.

938
00:50:46.417 --> 00:50:48.458
but people don't know
that I called them.

939
00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:51.542
-Oh no.

940
00:50:53.542 --> 00:50:55.625
-If I don't get the chance
to earn her trust again

941
00:50:55.708 --> 00:50:57.000
or her forgiveness...

942
00:50:57.042 --> 00:50:58.958
-Hey. hey. hey. It's gonna
be okay. Right?

943
00:50:59.042 --> 00:51:01.250
It's only been a day.
Right?

944
00:51:01.333 --> 00:51:03.250
Uncle Jackson was right
when he said

945
00:51:03.375 --> 00:51:07.000
people get lost out here
all the time.

946
00:51:07.083 --> 00:51:10.333
They don't... they don't realize
how far something is on a map.

947
00:51:10.458 --> 00:51:12.208
Or they leave their
phones behind

948
00:51:12.292 --> 00:51:15.125
'cause they're trying
to unplug.

949
00:51:15.208 --> 00:51:17.833
But you know what?
They always turn up.

950
00:51:20.375 --> 00:51:23.833
-Yeah. I hope you're right.

951
00:51:23.917 --> 00:51:25.250
[sniffs]

952
00:51:26.875 --> 00:51:28.458
-I'll call you later. okay?

953
00:51:29.667 --> 00:51:30.667
-Okay.

954
00:51:36.292 --> 00:51:37.333
Thanks again.

955
00:51:37.417 --> 00:51:38.375
-Yeah.

956
00:51:40.875 --> 00:51:41.667
[car engine starts]

957
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:44.792
-Regan.

958
00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:56.708
-It looks like we...
we ran...

959
00:51:56.792 --> 00:52:02.292
we ran straight north...
after that wreck. so...

960
00:52:02.417 --> 00:52:06.167
hopefully the... the road's
still to the west of us.

961
00:52:08.042 --> 00:52:10.500
We just need to get away
from that lunatic

962
00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:12.625
so we can get back to it safely.

963
00:52:12.708 --> 00:52:14.792
-You were always good
at directions.

964
00:52:14.875 --> 00:52:15.792
-Yeah.

965
00:52:15.875 --> 00:52:17.000
-Oh! Ow. ow!
-Ooh. careful.

966
00:52:17.042 --> 00:52:18.625
-Ow. ow.

967
00:52:18.708 --> 00:52:23.333
-Wait. Wait. let's get...
back over here.

968
00:52:23.417 --> 00:52:24.833
-No. I'm okay.
-Yeah?

969
00:52:24.917 --> 00:52:25.750
-I'm okay.

970
00:52:27.083 --> 00:52:28.375
-Alright. Come here.
you need to sit down.

971
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.083
-You need to sit down.
-Alright.

972
00:52:32.167 --> 00:52:33.167
-Careful.

973
00:52:35.167 --> 00:52:37.292
-[groans]

974
00:52:37.375 --> 00:52:40.792
Regan would've told someone
that we were missing.

975
00:52:40.792 --> 00:52:42.917
Rangers are probably out
right now looking for us.

976
00:52:45.458 --> 00:52:46.542
-We need to get back to her

977
00:52:46.625 --> 00:52:50.042
before they realize
she's a liability.

978
00:52:50.125 --> 00:52:53.125
-Jackson wouldn't hurt a child.

979
00:52:53.208 --> 00:52:54.208
No.

980
00:52:56.042 --> 00:52:57.042
-What are you doing here?

981
00:52:57.167 --> 00:52:59.042
-I didn't mean to startle you.

982
00:52:59.125 --> 00:53:00.542
-Is it something
about my parents?

983
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:06.708
-Can we... go somewhere
and talk?

984
00:53:06.792 --> 00:53:08.167
I think your parents have
gotten mixed up in something

985
00:53:08.208 --> 00:53:10.542
I've been investigating.

986
00:53:10.625 --> 00:53:11.792
-Aren't you just a trainee?

987
00:53:11.875 --> 00:53:13.500
-Yes. But there's something big
happening here

988
00:53:13.583 --> 00:53:15.125
that a lot of people pretend
not to see.

989
00:53:15.208 --> 00:53:17.042
and I wanna put a stop
to those things.

990
00:53:17.125 --> 00:53:19.083
-Like what?

991
00:53:19.208 --> 00:53:20.625
-Like poaching.

992
00:53:20.708 --> 00:53:21.750
-Poaching?

993
00:53:23.458 --> 00:53:25.458
My parents would never be
involved in something like that.

994
00:53:25.542 --> 00:53:27.375
-Maybe not intentionally.

995
00:53:27.458 --> 00:53:29.917
Please. We shouldn't
talk here.

996
00:53:34.875 --> 00:53:35.792
[camera snaps]

997
00:53:37.958 --> 00:53:39.667
-Try anything and
there's evidence right there

998
00:53:39.708 --> 00:53:40.875
of who did it.

999
00:53:42.875 --> 00:53:44.375
-You're a smart girl.

1000
00:53:44.458 --> 00:53:46.333
But I hope I can show you
that I'm on your side.

1001
00:53:50.875 --> 00:53:53.375
[ominous music]

1002
00:53:59.208 --> 00:54:00.542
-You got the cash?

1003
00:54:02.958 --> 00:54:04.250
-Is it done?

1004
00:54:04.875 --> 00:54:06.250
-Almost.

1005
00:54:06.375 --> 00:54:07.750
-What's that supposed to mean?

1006
00:54:07.833 --> 00:54:10.500
-Look. they're not gonna be
an issue for you anymore.

1007
00:54:10.542 --> 00:54:12.333
You have my word.

1008
00:54:12.417 --> 00:54:14.667
Since when did you wanna know
all the dirty details?

1009
00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:17.542
-Since it's obvious you're
not telling me something.

1010
00:54:17.542 --> 00:54:19.375
-They tried to escape.
they crashed their car.

1011
00:54:19.458 --> 00:54:20.500
and they ran into the woods.

1012
00:54:20.542 --> 00:54:21.667
-That's not good enough.

1013
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:23.250
I got rangers sniffing around.

1014
00:54:23.375 --> 00:54:25.000
the FEDs are waiting
for just one mistake.

1015
00:54:25.083 --> 00:54:26.625
No loose ends.

1016
00:54:26.708 --> 00:54:30.000
-I clipped one in the leg.
They're as good as dead.

1017
00:54:30.083 --> 00:54:31.250
If anybody finds their body.

1018
00:54:31.333 --> 00:54:33.917
it's a case of a couple
of idiot hikers.

1019
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.042
Open and shut.

1020
00:54:36.125 --> 00:54:37.750
-Where's their car?

1021
00:54:37.833 --> 00:54:41.417
-Off the old logging road.
Just above the cabin.

1022
00:54:45.792 --> 00:54:48.625
-Alright.
Get back to the cabin.

1023
00:54:49.458 --> 00:54:52.667
Focus on prepping for
the clients next week.

1024
00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:53.708
It's all there.

1025
00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:57.917
Forget any of this
ever happened.

1026
00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.333
-Always do.

1027
00:55:08.083 --> 00:55:09.708
-It's wolves mostly.

1028
00:55:09.875 --> 00:55:11.792
Rich folks wanna hunt something
wild and dangerous.

1029
00:55:14.292 --> 00:55:15.917
-That's so cruel.

1030
00:55:16.042 --> 00:55:17.167
-It is.

1031
00:55:17.167 --> 00:55:18.417
I mean. it's not illegal
to hunt them.

1032
00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:20.083
but only within special
trapping seasons

1033
00:55:20.208 --> 00:55:22.458
and never in the park.

1034
00:55:22.583 --> 00:55:24.708
Wolves are protected
within federal lands.

1035
00:55:24.792 --> 00:55:27.833
That's where the poachers
come in.

1036
00:55:27.917 --> 00:55:29.333
-So why aren't your forest
ranger buddies

1037
00:55:29.458 --> 00:55:31.833
doing anything about it?

1038
00:55:31.917 --> 00:55:33.042
-Some have tried

1039
00:55:33.167 --> 00:55:35.125
but we're understaffed
on a huge amount of land.

1040
00:55:35.208 --> 00:55:37.292
And these people know how to
cover up what they're doing.

1041
00:55:37.375 --> 00:55:38.625
You know. say.
by owning a resort

1042
00:55:38.708 --> 00:55:41.333
just outside the
federal boundaries.

1043
00:55:41.375 --> 00:55:43.708
-You think the owner of
this place is in on it?

1044
00:55:43.792 --> 00:55:45.250
-Yeah.

1045
00:55:45.333 --> 00:55:47.833
-I still don't understand what
that has to do with my parents.

1046
00:55:47.875 --> 00:55:49.333
-Because the owner.
Jackson Green.

1047
00:55:49.417 --> 00:55:51.125
is an old friend
of your father's.

1048
00:55:51.208 --> 00:55:53.625
-That doesn't mean anything.
they went to college together.

1049
00:55:53.708 --> 00:55:55.333
-Jackson has a private
lounge downstairs

1050
00:55:55.417 --> 00:55:58.833
where he entertains
his important clientele.

1051
00:55:58.917 --> 00:56:01.250
I saw your father go
in empty-handed

1052
00:56:01.333 --> 00:56:03.500
and come out with an envelope.

1053
00:56:03.542 --> 00:56:06.042
And he looks nervous.

1054
00:56:06.125 --> 00:56:08.500
-But I talked to Jackson
and he said he would help.

1055
00:56:08.583 --> 00:56:09.875
-And you trust him?

1056
00:56:09.875 --> 00:56:10.833
-Yeah.

1057
00:56:10.875 --> 00:56:13.000
-You can't trust him. Regan.
Okay?

1058
00:56:13.083 --> 00:56:15.042
You can't trust either of them.

1059
00:56:15.125 --> 00:56:17.333
-But I can trust you?

1060
00:56:17.375 --> 00:56:19.333
The person calling my father
a poacher

1061
00:56:19.458 --> 00:56:21.000
because you saw him
with an envelope.

1062
00:56:21.083 --> 00:56:23.000
-I'm not calling your father
anything. Okay?

1063
00:56:23.125 --> 00:56:25.667
But he took something from
Jackson and now he's missing.

1064
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:27.542
That makes me think
he could be in danger.

1065
00:56:27.667 --> 00:56:29.000
-If this family is so dangerous

1066
00:56:29.125 --> 00:56:31.875
then why isn't anyone
doing anything about it?

1067
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.500
-Take a look around you.

1068
00:56:33.625 --> 00:56:36.167
They've been prominent in
this community for a long time.

1069
00:56:36.167 --> 00:56:39.333
If you know the right people.
and you have enough money.

1070
00:56:39.375 --> 00:56:41.042
you can get away with
just about anything.

1071
00:56:42.958 --> 00:56:44.250
-This is insane.

1072
00:56:44.375 --> 00:56:47.000
I mean. Tyler has done nothing
but help.

1073
00:56:47.042 --> 00:56:49.333
-Look. you have a decision
to make. Regan.

1074
00:56:49.417 --> 00:56:50.667
All I can tell you about myself

1075
00:56:50.708 --> 00:56:52.625
is how much I care about
keeping this place safe.

1076
00:56:52.708 --> 00:56:56.292
That includes the wolves
and your parents too.

1077
00:56:56.375 --> 00:56:57.458
And you.

1078
00:57:00.583 --> 00:57:02.208
I'll be close by.

1079
00:57:02.292 --> 00:57:04.375
Just please. don't go anywhere
with Jackson or Tyler again

1080
00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:05.833
without calling me.

1081
00:57:07.708 --> 00:57:10.542
This is the number to
my station and to my cell.

1082
00:57:10.625 --> 00:57:11.833
Call me any time.

1083
00:57:29.292 --> 00:57:31.125
[phone vibrates]

1084
00:57:35.167 --> 00:57:36.375
-Hey.

1085
00:57:36.458 --> 00:57:38.708
-Hey. Just calling
to check up on you.

1086
00:57:38.792 --> 00:57:41.917
-That's really sweet of you.
Thank you.

1087
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:42.958
-Any word?

1088
00:57:43.083 --> 00:57:45.583
-Not yet. Hey. can I ask you
a question?

1089
00:57:45.667 --> 00:57:47.250
-Yeah. What's up?

1090
00:57:47.333 --> 00:57:49.583
-When your uncle said that he
doesn't agree with the rangers

1091
00:57:49.667 --> 00:57:52.000
on much... what's his problem
with them?

1092
00:57:52.083 --> 00:57:54.042
-Oh. it's just local politics
and stuff.

1093
00:57:54.167 --> 00:57:57.500
Conservation versus commerce.
That eternal debate.

1094
00:57:57.583 --> 00:57:59.958
-He's not on the side
of conservation. I take it?

1095
00:58:00.042 --> 00:58:02.000
-Let's just say he's not
into being told

1096
00:58:02.042 --> 00:58:03.375
what he can or can't do.

1097
00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:06.458
-But he did call and ask them
for their help like he said?

1098
00:58:06.542 --> 00:58:08.000
-Of course.

1099
00:58:08.083 --> 00:58:11.875
All hands on deck.
just like we promised.

1100
00:58:11.958 --> 00:58:13.833
-Great.

1101
00:58:13.875 --> 00:58:15.917
Uh. look. I'm getting another
call so I gotta go.

1102
00:58:26.875 --> 00:58:28.042
-[voicemail] This is ranger
Ward.

1103
00:58:33.583 --> 00:58:35.667
[digging]

1104
00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:43.875
-Come in.

1105
00:58:44.542 --> 00:58:46.000
[sighs]

1106
00:58:49.417 --> 00:58:53.042
Jackson never called the ranger
station like he said he would.

1107
00:58:53.125 --> 00:58:55.167
-I could've told you that
before if you'd asked.

1108
00:58:55.333 --> 00:58:58.375
-Yeah. well I didn't know if I
could trust you then. did I?

1109
00:58:58.458 --> 00:58:59.833
-And what about now?

1110
00:59:01.542 --> 00:59:03.250
-Yeah.

1111
00:59:03.375 --> 00:59:04.625
I trust you.

1112
00:59:05.542 --> 00:59:06.875
And I have a plan.

1113
00:59:06.958 --> 00:59:08.500
You said you saw my dad leave
Jackson's lounge

1114
00:59:08.583 --> 00:59:10.292
with an envelope?

1115
00:59:10.375 --> 00:59:11.833
-That's right.

1116
00:59:11.917 --> 00:59:13.958
-I think there could be
information in there.

1117
00:59:14.042 --> 00:59:16.292
You know. help us find them.
know where they went.

1118
00:59:18.208 --> 00:59:20.167
-It's possible.

1119
00:59:20.208 --> 00:59:21.833
-Help me get in there.

1120
00:59:21.875 --> 00:59:22.625
-If you get caught...

1121
00:59:22.708 --> 00:59:23.833
-I won't.

1122
00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:26.000
Not with your help.

1123
00:59:28.875 --> 00:59:31.917
But if you say no...
I'm going anyway.

1124
00:59:33.708 --> 00:59:36.833
[dramatic music]

1125
00:59:42.792 --> 00:59:45.458
-Jackson always makes
the rounds at 7:00 PM.

1126
00:59:45.542 --> 00:59:47.000
He'll be in the bar
for at least an hour

1127
00:59:47.125 --> 00:59:50.083
schmoozing with the guests.
looking for potential clients.

1128
00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:55.083
-That's our window.

1129
00:59:56.625 --> 00:59:58.833
-Cleaning staff always
has master keys.

1130
01:00:01.292 --> 01:00:04.000
The trick is making sure they
never know the keys are gone.

1131
01:00:27.042 --> 01:00:27.917
[drawers squeak]

1132
01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:41.500
-Hey.

1133
01:00:41.583 --> 01:00:42.875
-I'm still looking.

1134
01:00:48.083 --> 01:00:50.125
-Regan. Tyler just walked in.

1135
01:00:50.208 --> 01:00:51.167
-Hi.

1136
01:00:51.250 --> 01:00:52.375
-Excuse me.
If you guys need anything...

1137
01:00:52.458 --> 01:00:53.500
-Wait. is he coming back
this way?

1138
01:00:53.542 --> 01:00:54.792
-I'm watching.

1139
01:00:58.875 --> 01:01:00.167
-We gotta talk in your office.

1140
01:01:02.167 --> 01:01:03.667
-You need to get
outta there now.

1141
01:01:03.708 --> 01:01:05.417
-No. no. no!
I need more time.

1142
01:01:05.542 --> 01:01:06.458
-Regan. get out.

1143
01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:09.208
They're coming your way.

1144
01:01:12.708 --> 01:01:15.833
[ominous music]

1145
01:01:18.458 --> 01:01:21.875
-I'll be honest. I'm glad
we got rid of that guy.

1146
01:01:21.958 --> 01:01:23.333
We don't need him.

1147
01:01:26.042 --> 01:01:28.208
-Yeah. now that you're
stepping up. we sure don't.

1148
01:01:33.458 --> 01:01:34.875
And what about the Gerards?

1149
01:01:34.958 --> 01:01:36.667
I wanted them handled
before the day was out.

1150
01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:38.250
-There wasn't enough time.

1151
01:01:38.333 --> 01:01:40.875
The sun's going down.
I can't track ´em in the dark.

1152
01:01:40.958 --> 01:01:43.875
I managed to ditch
their car though.

1153
01:01:43.875 --> 01:01:46.708
-I am not gonna let Craig ruin
everything I built.

1154
01:01:46.792 --> 01:01:49.625
-What's the story
with you two anyway?

1155
01:01:49.708 --> 01:01:53.125
-Everything always came
so easy to Craig.

1156
01:01:53.208 --> 01:01:55.458
In college he had
a perfect girlfriend.

1157
01:01:55.542 --> 01:01:57.292
Quarterback.

1158
01:01:57.375 --> 01:01:59.750
Dean's list.

1159
01:01:59.833 --> 01:02:02.083
And honestly. I didn't care.
I was happy for him.

1160
01:02:04.375 --> 01:02:06.458
Until senior year.

1161
01:02:06.542 --> 01:02:08.292
-Was he why you quit college?

1162
01:02:08.375 --> 01:02:11.500
-Oh. no. no. no. no. no.
I didn't quit.

1163
01:02:11.542 --> 01:02:13.167
I was asked to leave.

1164
01:02:17.958 --> 01:02:19.750
It was after a football game.

1165
01:02:21.667 --> 01:02:23.000
He picked a fight
with some of the players

1166
01:02:23.042 --> 01:02:24.667
from the opposing team.

1167
01:02:24.708 --> 01:02:27.542
He was gonna get pummeled
so I jumped in.

1168
01:02:29.083 --> 01:02:31.208
Things got outta control

1169
01:02:31.292 --> 01:02:33.583
and the guy sustained
some serious injuries.

1170
01:02:33.708 --> 01:02:36.750
And then Craig's daddy
and the university swooped in

1171
01:02:36.833 --> 01:02:38.583
and saved him from
all repercussions.

1172
01:02:38.708 --> 01:02:40.333
And I was blamed
for everything.

1173
01:02:43.042 --> 01:02:46.167
And then his dad died and
he was left the business.

1174
01:02:47.542 --> 01:02:49.042
He was handed everything.

1175
01:02:50.333 --> 01:02:52.167
You know. having him come
to me begging for money

1176
01:02:52.250 --> 01:02:54.833
'cause he couldn't hack it...

1177
01:02:54.875 --> 01:02:56.917
that was one of the best days
of my life.

1178
01:02:59.750 --> 01:03:04.875
But... well. he's outlived
his usefulness at this point.

1179
01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.208
-I'll handle ´em.

1180
01:03:07.917 --> 01:03:09.917
-Yeah. you'd better.

1181
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.167
We can't go another day

1182
01:03:11.292 --> 01:03:13.208
without actually sending out
a search party.

1183
01:03:13.292 --> 01:03:15.042
Their daughter
isn't that stupid.

1184
01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:17.042
-No. but she trusts me.

1185
01:03:17.208 --> 01:03:19.333
If things were to turn sideways
I can handle her too.

1186
01:03:19.375 --> 01:03:20.125
-No. no. no.

1187
01:03:20.208 --> 01:03:21.250
Just look. too many people know

1188
01:03:21.333 --> 01:03:22.667
she's been asking questions.
Alright?

1189
01:03:22.792 --> 01:03:24.500
Just settle down.

1190
01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:25.667
Make sure you find the Gerards

1191
01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:32.667
before anyone else has
a chance to. Okay?

1192
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:37.042
We can still make this
out to be a. uh...

1193
01:03:37.042 --> 01:03:39.042
misadventure on their part.

1194
01:03:40.542 --> 01:03:43.833
-Don't worry.
I'll go out at first light.

1195
01:03:43.917 --> 01:03:45.250
I've got this.

1196
01:03:50.875 --> 01:03:54.083
-I'm trusting you.
Don't make me regret it.

1197
01:04:02.625 --> 01:04:05.875
[door opens and shuts]

1198
01:04:10.042 --> 01:04:12.125
-[breathing heavily]

1199
01:04:12.833 --> 01:04:14.333
-Shh. shh. shh!
It's me.

1200
01:04:14.458 --> 01:04:15.792
Tell me what happened.

1201
01:04:15.875 --> 01:04:18.292
-[panting]

1202
01:04:19.708 --> 01:04:23.167
We have to stop Tyler.
He's gonna kill my parents.

1203
01:04:29.125 --> 01:04:31.417
-We should go to the rangers.
Tell them what's going on.

1204
01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:32.667
-No. No!

1205
01:04:32.708 --> 01:04:35.625
Tyler and Jackson are just
gonna deny everything.

1206
01:04:36.875 --> 01:04:40.000
And they're gonna know
it was me.

1207
01:04:40.083 --> 01:04:42.292
They have an idea
of where they are.

1208
01:04:42.375 --> 01:04:44.292
Nobody else knows where
to look for my parents.

1209
01:04:46.083 --> 01:04:47.458
-So we follow Tyler.

1210
01:04:48.542 --> 01:04:49.958
-It's our only chance.

1211
01:04:50.042 --> 01:04:51.333
-It could work.

1212
01:04:51.417 --> 01:04:52.792
The rangers have tracking
devices for animals.

1213
01:04:52.917 --> 01:04:54.500
If we could just plant
one on him...

1214
01:04:55.042 --> 01:04:57.458
-Yeah. I could do it.
I'll ask to see him tonight.

1215
01:04:57.542 --> 01:04:58.792
-No. no way.

1216
01:04:58.875 --> 01:05:00.250
Not after we know
what he's capable of.

1217
01:05:01.042 --> 01:05:03.417
-I can't let him
find them first.

1218
01:05:06.375 --> 01:05:07.542
-Okay.

1219
01:05:12.625 --> 01:05:14.417
[party music playing]

1220
01:05:20.833 --> 01:05:22.583
-Sorry. give me one sec.

1221
01:05:24.042 --> 01:05:25.167
-How's it going?
-Hey.

1222
01:05:25.208 --> 01:05:26.667
-You can take a seat
right here.

1223
01:05:28.875 --> 01:05:30.083
-Thanks for the invite.

1224
01:05:30.167 --> 01:05:31.667
I. uh. needed to get out
of my cabin.

1225
01:05:31.708 --> 01:05:33.833
-Yeah. of course.

1226
01:05:33.875 --> 01:05:37.083
Um... I wish we could meet under
better circumstances. but...

1227
01:05:37.167 --> 01:05:38.458
it's good to see you.

1228
01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:42.250
-So do you guys do
this every night?

1229
01:05:42.333 --> 01:05:43.333
-[chuckles]
Yeah.

1230
01:05:43.375 --> 01:05:46.208
It's a really good way
to unwind.

1231
01:05:46.333 --> 01:05:48.042
-Do you like your co-workers?

1232
01:05:48.167 --> 01:05:50.167
-Yeah. they're okay.

1233
01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:53.083
Most of them are just seasonal
employees. so...

1234
01:05:53.208 --> 01:05:56.167
we don't get too attached
to anyone around here.

1235
01:05:56.250 --> 01:05:57.167
-Hmm.

1236
01:05:58.458 --> 01:06:01.292
-Oh! Are you. uh...
are you thirsty?

1237
01:06:01.375 --> 01:06:03.333
-Uh... actually do you have
anything else?

1238
01:06:03.417 --> 01:06:04.333
I don't...

1239
01:06:04.417 --> 01:06:07.917
-Oh. right. Sorry about that.
Stupid me.

1240
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.542
I'll be right back.
Don't move.

1241
01:06:17.708 --> 01:06:18.542
[bottles clinking]

1242
01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:37.708
So they only had this.
uh. this cola here.

1243
01:06:37.792 --> 01:06:41.792
The... Hey. are you okay?

1244
01:06:41.875 --> 01:06:43.250
-Oh. sorry. I just...

1245
01:06:43.375 --> 01:06:45.333
Maybe I shouldn't have
come out tonight.

1246
01:06:45.375 --> 01:06:49.208
-Okay. Uh... maybe the...
the drink will help?

1247
01:06:49.333 --> 01:06:52.167
-I don't think so.
Um... but thank you.

1248
01:06:52.292 --> 01:06:54.500
I'll call you tomorrow. okay?

1249
01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:56.417
-Yeah. Okay.

1250
01:07:01.542 --> 01:07:03.417
[crickets chirping]

1251
01:07:10.708 --> 01:07:13.583
[soft music]

1252
01:07:15.875 --> 01:07:17.542
-You should try and go to sleep.

1253
01:07:19.042 --> 01:07:20.583
-I wish I could.

1254
01:07:22.958 --> 01:07:25.167
-I wanna tell you something.

1255
01:07:27.042 --> 01:07:29.583
-Have we reached final
confession time already?

1256
01:07:30.708 --> 01:07:32.458
-I'm serious.

1257
01:07:32.542 --> 01:07:35.333
-I'm sorry.
I'm listening.

1258
01:07:38.250 --> 01:07:40.833
-Bringing Regan on this trip.

1259
01:07:40.917 --> 01:07:44.875
it wasn't ´cause I was worried
about leaving her home alone.

1260
01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.833
I mean. despite what she thinks.
I actually do trust her.

1261
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.208
-Okay.

1262
01:07:55.292 --> 01:07:57.583
-My real worry was us.

1263
01:07:59.083 --> 01:08:02.167
Romantic couple's vacation?

1264
01:08:02.292 --> 01:08:03.833
-Could end up being a disaster.

1265
01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:08.458
-Yeah.

1266
01:08:08.542 --> 01:08:13.458
-Well... I guess it turned out
better than I expected. huh?

1267
01:08:13.542 --> 01:08:15.250
[both chuckle]

1268
01:08:21.292 --> 01:08:25.125
-We've just been so
out of sync lately.

1269
01:08:25.208 --> 01:08:27.208
How did it come to this?

1270
01:08:30.167 --> 01:08:32.667
-We both were consumed by work.

1271
01:08:35.917 --> 01:08:40.125
-[sighs] Yeah.
I guess so.

1272
01:08:47.417 --> 01:08:48.917
[sighs]

1273
01:08:52.625 --> 01:08:55.375
-Well. if this is confession
time. I have one.

1274
01:09:00.375 --> 01:09:03.500
I borrowed money from Jackson
last year to save the store.

1275
01:09:06.042 --> 01:09:08.792
That's why we're here.

1276
01:09:08.875 --> 01:09:15.333
I organized this trip to tell
him in person that I was done.

1277
01:09:15.417 --> 01:09:17.292
-I thought you said everything
was okay.

1278
01:09:19.958 --> 01:09:21.292
You said that...

1279
01:09:21.375 --> 01:09:22.417
that we had enough of a safety
net to keep going.

1280
01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:25.333
-Jackson was our safety net.

1281
01:09:25.375 --> 01:09:27.333
I paid him back but
that wasn't enough.

1282
01:09:29.125 --> 01:09:31.917
-What do you mean.
did he need more money?

1283
01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.208
-Not exactly.

1284
01:09:35.833 --> 01:09:42.708
He wanted me to help build a...
a clientele base in New York

1285
01:09:42.833 --> 01:09:47.125
of all those wealthy
east coast hunters

1286
01:09:47.208 --> 01:09:51.958
that are interested
in exotic adventures.

1287
01:09:52.042 --> 01:09:53.333
-Illegal poaching.

1288
01:09:55.333 --> 01:09:56.750
You knew?

1289
01:09:56.833 --> 01:10:02.875
-No. I... I mean.
I didn't at first.

1290
01:10:02.875 --> 01:10:05.208
Then I started to hear things
from the people

1291
01:10:05.292 --> 01:10:07.000
I referred to the lodge.

1292
01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:17.250
I guess I suspected more than
I wanted to admit.

1293
01:10:18.917 --> 01:10:21.500
I told him I wanted out.

1294
01:10:21.542 --> 01:10:23.667
-Someone like that doesn't
take no for an answer.

1295
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:26.667
-I thought he was just trying to
show me that he was in control

1296
01:10:26.833 --> 01:10:29.875
by sending me on this
dumb errand

1297
01:10:29.958 --> 01:10:33.500
in exchange for not telling you
about the... the money.

1298
01:10:33.583 --> 01:10:38.417
I swear. I swear. I never
thought we'd be in danger.

1299
01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:41.667
-You knew all along
and you lied to me.

1300
01:10:41.708 --> 01:10:42.750
-I know.

1301
01:10:45.667 --> 01:10:50.542
I didn't want you to think
less of me.

1302
01:10:50.625 --> 01:10:52.667
I'm so sorry about all of it.

1303
01:11:03.458 --> 01:11:04.667
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

1304
01:11:07.417 --> 01:11:09.000
-I don't know how I'm supposed
to stay here all night.

1305
01:11:09.083 --> 01:11:10.417
I feel like I should be
out there

1306
01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:11.500
looking for them right now.

1307
01:11:12.583 --> 01:11:16.708
-It's just a few more hours.
You should get some sleep.

1308
01:11:18.208 --> 01:11:20.167
-Will you stay?

1309
01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:22.833
-Of course.
You're safe. I promise.

1310
01:11:25.042 --> 01:11:26.542
-I believe you.

1311
01:11:32.667 --> 01:11:33.708
Thank you.

1312
01:11:42.292 --> 01:11:45.333
[dramatic music]

1313
01:11:46.375 --> 01:11:48.417
-[wolves howling]
-[branch cracks]

1314
01:12:06.417 --> 01:12:07.750
-Craig! Wake up.
-What's going on?

1315
01:12:07.875 --> 01:12:08.750
-Wake up.

1316
01:12:10.958 --> 01:12:12.500
-Is that a wolf?

1317
01:12:12.583 --> 01:12:14.542
-Yeah. we must be too close
to their territory.

1318
01:12:14.667 --> 01:12:16.000
We have to head back
towards the route.

1319
01:12:16.083 --> 01:12:18.083
-Okay.
-Okay.

1320
01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:19.167
-Okay.
-[groans]

1321
01:12:19.208 --> 01:12:20.250
Hold on.

1322
01:12:20.333 --> 01:12:21.542
-We need to move.
Can you make it?

1323
01:12:21.542 --> 01:12:22.833
-Yeah. I'll be fine.

1324
01:12:22.917 --> 01:12:23.917
-Okay. let's go.

1325
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:24.958
-[groans]
-Come on.

1326
01:12:25.083 --> 01:12:26.042
-Okay. Ow.

1327
01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:29.917
-There you are.
You scared me.

1328
01:12:31.292 --> 01:12:33.167
-Oh. sorry.
I couldn't sleep.

1329
01:12:33.250 --> 01:12:34.833
-Do you want some company?

1330
01:12:34.917 --> 01:12:35.958
-Sure.

1331
01:12:40.542 --> 01:12:42.458
It's so peaceful out here.

1332
01:12:43.875 --> 01:12:46.000
I never knew a place
could feel like this.

1333
01:12:47.917 --> 01:12:51.000
I understand why you wanna
protect it at all costs.

1334
01:12:52.625 --> 01:12:54.000
-My parents have always
been involved

1335
01:12:54.042 --> 01:12:55.792
in environmental issues.

1336
01:12:55.875 --> 01:12:58.417
Protesting projects that harm
the land. that sort of thing.

1337
01:12:59.833 --> 01:13:02.458
[chuckles] I remember one time
when I was 11 or 12.

1338
01:13:02.542 --> 01:13:03.667
my parents dropped me off
at my grandma's

1339
01:13:03.792 --> 01:13:05.667
so they could go to a protest.

1340
01:13:05.708 --> 01:13:07.542
They didn't come back.

1341
01:13:07.625 --> 01:13:10.792
I didn't know where they were
for three days.

1342
01:13:10.875 --> 01:13:12.500
-What happened?

1343
01:13:12.542 --> 01:13:15.125
-All the protestors
had been arrested.

1344
01:13:15.208 --> 01:13:18.042
They were finally let out
and everything was fine. but...

1345
01:13:18.125 --> 01:13:21.500
I was never so scared in my life
not knowing where they were.

1346
01:13:21.583 --> 01:13:22.958
I understand how
you're feeling.

1347
01:13:29.167 --> 01:13:33.500
-Are they the reason you risk
so much to expose the poachers?

1348
01:13:33.542 --> 01:13:34.917
-They taught me not to back down
from people

1349
01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.125
who care more about money
than about living creatures.

1350
01:13:41.583 --> 01:13:44.500
-I'm glad you got them back.

1351
01:13:44.625 --> 01:13:46.667
I really hope I get
mine back too.

1352
01:13:51.958 --> 01:13:54.750
I just can't stop thinking
about them being out there.

1353
01:13:54.875 --> 01:13:58.292
you know. possibly hurt
or something.

1354
01:13:58.375 --> 01:13:59.542
[sighs]

1355
01:13:59.625 --> 01:14:00.917
What if they don't make it
to tomorrow?

1356
01:14:01.042 --> 01:14:02.042
-Hey.

1357
01:14:02.208 --> 01:14:06.083
They must be pretty smart.
They raised you. right?

1358
01:14:06.167 --> 01:14:10.708
Plus. I met your mother.
She seems pretty tough to me.

1359
01:14:10.833 --> 01:14:12.375
[chuckles]

1360
01:14:12.542 --> 01:14:14.458
They'll take care
of themselves.

1361
01:14:15.667 --> 01:14:17.750
And we'll find them.
I promise.

1362
01:14:27.125 --> 01:14:30.167
[dramatic music]

1363
01:14:35.542 --> 01:14:36.917
-How does it look?

1364
01:14:37.958 --> 01:14:40.333
-He's about a quarter
mile ahead.

1365
01:14:40.417 --> 01:14:42.000
-Okay.

1366
01:14:42.042 --> 01:14:43.083
Good.

1367
01:14:55.875 --> 01:14:57.500
-Wait. he's slowing down.

1368
01:15:10.917 --> 01:15:11.792
It stopped.

1369
01:15:13.125 --> 01:15:14.292
I think he parked.

1370
01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:37.625
[dramatic music]

1371
01:16:02.583 --> 01:16:03.917
-Here!

1372
01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:06.708
-Shh. Sound carries out here.

1373
01:16:06.833 --> 01:16:08.583
-This could be from their car.

1374
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.125
-This way.

1375
01:16:33.208 --> 01:16:35.167
[both groaning]

1376
01:16:36.458 --> 01:16:38.250
-Ahhhh!!!!

1377
01:16:38.333 --> 01:16:39.667
[panting]

1378
01:16:40.542 --> 01:16:41.917
-Oh God.

1379
01:16:42.042 --> 01:16:43.083
Okay.

1380
01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:50.708
-[coughing]

1381
01:16:52.083 --> 01:16:53.042
-Here.

1382
01:16:56.708 --> 01:16:58.833
-I think you should leave
me here.

1383
01:16:58.917 --> 01:17:02.583
-No. I am not doing that.

1384
01:17:02.667 --> 01:17:05.792
-You need to think about
at least one of us

1385
01:17:05.875 --> 01:17:08.000
getting back to Regan.

1386
01:17:08.042 --> 01:17:10.000
-Okay. you listen to me
right now. Okay?

1387
01:17:10.125 --> 01:17:13.875
We are both making it
back to Regan. Okay?

1388
01:17:13.958 --> 01:17:18.375
I have reported from war zones.
from natural disasters...

1389
01:17:18.458 --> 01:17:19.542
and I have seen
a lot of people

1390
01:17:19.667 --> 01:17:21.708
in a lot worse situations
than this.

1391
01:17:21.833 --> 01:17:23.167
We are not giving up
that easily.

1392
01:17:23.250 --> 01:17:24.333
Do you understand?

1393
01:17:25.375 --> 01:17:26.250
-Okay.

1394
01:17:28.042 --> 01:17:29.458
-Craig.

1395
01:17:29.542 --> 01:17:30.333
Craig!

1396
01:17:31.958 --> 01:17:35.208
Craig. Craig. Craig!

1397
01:17:37.583 --> 01:17:39.167
[grunts]

1398
01:17:47.542 --> 01:17:48.917
-Beautiful. isn't it?

1399
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.042
-Ranger Ward. Morning.

1400
01:17:52.167 --> 01:17:53.542
-Mr Green. uh...

1401
01:17:53.625 --> 01:17:56.250
I just wanted to let you know
we're gonna be starting

1402
01:17:56.333 --> 01:17:59.333
that search for that couple
who were staying here.

1403
01:17:59.417 --> 01:18:01.125
-Yeah. of course.
Of course.

1404
01:18:01.208 --> 01:18:02.917
You know we hope for the best
in these situations.

1405
01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.458
but unfortunately sometimes...

1406
01:18:04.542 --> 01:18:07.917
-Unfortunately sometimes people
think they can handle this area

1407
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.875
when they are woefully
inexperienced.

1408
01:18:11.958 --> 01:18:16.042
Listen. I wanted to speak
with their daughter Regan

1409
01:18:16.125 --> 01:18:19.583
but. uh. I haven't been able
to track her down this morning.

1410
01:18:19.667 --> 01:18:22.042
-She wasn't at her
family's cabin?

1411
01:18:22.167 --> 01:18:23.958
-She's not answering
her phone either.

1412
01:18:24.042 --> 01:18:27.125
-Hmm. Well I'm sure
she's nearby.

1413
01:18:27.208 --> 01:18:29.500
She'd wanna participate
in the search. right?

1414
01:18:29.583 --> 01:18:31.417
-That's what I thought. but...

1415
01:18:33.542 --> 01:18:35.333
Don't tell me you've lost
her too.

1416
01:18:57.583 --> 01:18:58.792
-Hey. wait.

1417
01:18:58.875 --> 01:19:00.167
It stopped again.

1418
01:19:02.042 --> 01:19:03.250
-He could be taking a break.

1419
01:19:03.333 --> 01:19:04.833
-Yeah. or he could've found
the tracker.

1420
01:19:04.917 --> 01:19:06.167
-Gotcha!

[intense music]

1424
01:19:26.542 --> 01:19:27.708
-Get your hands off of her.

1425
01:19:27.792 --> 01:19:31.000
-You two thought you were
so clever.

1426
01:19:31.042 --> 01:19:33.167
Is he the type of guy
that you're into?

1427
01:19:33.208 --> 01:19:34.542
The hero type?

1428
01:19:34.625 --> 01:19:36.167
How boring.

1429
01:19:36.208 --> 01:19:37.208

-Screw you.

1441
01:20:01.333 --> 01:20:03.083
You know you're just like
your uncle?

1442
01:20:03.167 --> 01:20:05.667
-There's worse people
to look up to.

1443
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:07.833
Do you really think you can
outsmart me?

1444

[chuckles]

1445
01:20:13.833 --> 01:20:15.208
Nice try.

[thud]

1447
01:20:22.083 --> 01:20:25.500
-Don't move or I will gladly put
this branch through your skull.

1448
01:20:25.542 --> 01:20:26.333
-Mom!

1449
01:20:26.417 --> 01:20:27.375
-We need rope.

1450

-He has a backpack.

1451
01:20:28.458 --> 01:20:29.500
-Go see if he's got rope.

1452
01:20:30.292 --> 01:20:31.833
I said don't move!

Alright. get up.

1455
01:20:42.042 --> 01:20:43.500
Turn around.

1456
01:20:43.542 --> 01:20:44.875
Slowly!

1457
01:20:46.583 --> 01:20:47.958
-You´re gonna regret this.

1458
01:20:48.708 --> 01:20:49.625
-Move!

1459
01:20:50.750 --> 01:20:52.375
Up against that tree.

1460
01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:54.000
Get down.

-Here. let me help you up.

1463

Are you okay?

1464
01:21:14.042 --> 01:21:15.208
-Uh huh.
-Okay.

1465
01:21:19.083 --> 01:21:22.000
-Well this is convenient.

1466

Got you all in one place.

-Go on. There you go.

1472
01:21:40.292 --> 01:21:41.458
Where is he?

01:21:43.333 --> 01:21:44.583
[Jackson] Hmm?

1474

Well that serves him right.
Spineless. worthless coward.

Almost ruined my life
for the second time.

Almost!

1480

Everybody always had
to rescue Craig.

could never save himself.

1482
01:22:13.542 --> 01:22:15.542
Couldn't even provide
for his own family.

1483
01:22:15.625 --> 01:22:18.333
-Yeah. well at least he had a
family worth fighting for. Okay?

1484
01:22:18.458 --> 01:22:19.750
-Shut up.

1485
01:22:19.833 --> 01:22:22.000
-And you...

1486
01:22:22.042 --> 01:22:24.000
I couldn't rely on you
for one simple task?

1487
01:22:24.083 --> 01:22:24.917
-I tried.

1488
01:22:25.042 --> 01:22:26.333
-[mocking]
I tried!

1489
01:22:28.875 --> 01:22:31.208

-Much better.

is working.

into this mess.

-I know you are.

1515
01:23:49.208 --> 01:23:53.958
-And thank you for not
giving up on me out there.

1516

-I would never.

1517
01:23:56.417 --> 01:24:02.958
-And I promise from now on
I'll always be honest with you.

1518

No more lies.

-And I know I haven't always
been present for you.

I love my job. but...

1521
01:24:12.667 --> 01:24:14.625
you have to know
that there is no story

1522
01:24:14.708 --> 01:24:17.750
that is more important to me
than the story of our family.

1523
01:24:21.042 --> 01:24:22.542
-I'm glad to hear that.

1524

-I know you haven't been
that happy with me recently.

-Oh. Honey. it's all
in the past.

1531
01:24:56.792 --> 01:24:58.667
Doesn't matter now.

-No. it does matter.

hard on you.

more time. you know.

normal circumstances.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:47.708
-I could write to you.

-Write to me?
-Mm-hmm.
