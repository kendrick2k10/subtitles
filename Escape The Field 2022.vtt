3
00:03:31.518 --> 00:03:33.386
Stay away from me!
Stay back!
Jesus Christ!

4
00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:34.816
Okay. Okay. ma'am. Okay.

5
00:03:34.851 --> 00:03:37.753
Just calm down. okay. ma'am?
Just calm down.

6
00:03:37.788 --> 00:03:38.853
Where am I?

7
00:03:38.888 --> 00:03:40.987
I have no idea.

8
00:03:41.022 --> 00:03:43.957
I just woke up in this field.
and I'm looking to leave. okay?

9
00:03:43.992 --> 00:03:46.300
You want to take it easy
with that?

10
00:03:46.335 --> 00:03:49.028
Okay. I'm gonna stand up now.
all right?

11
00:03:49.063 --> 00:03:50.502
Don't.

12
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.341
Listen! Listen to me.

13
00:03:55.806 --> 00:03:58.510
I'm unarmed. okay?

14
00:03:58.545 --> 00:04:02.415
And if you were
going to shoot me.
you'd have done it already.

15
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.583
So I'm getting up. okay?

16
00:04:08.357 --> 00:04:09.983
I'm not gonna hurt you.

17
00:04:13.494 --> 00:04:14.856
I don't believe you.

18
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.694
For Chrissakes.

19
00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.302
If I did this.
why would I give you a gun?

20
00:04:25.506 --> 00:04:26.538
Huh?

21
00:04:29.103 --> 00:04:30.509
Well. who are you then?

22
00:04:31.512 --> 00:04:34.381
Name's Tyler. And you?

23
00:04:35.681 --> 00:04:37.681
Sam.
Sam.

24
00:04:37.716 --> 00:04:41.883
Hi. Sam. It's nice to meet you.
Do you mind. huh?

25
00:04:41.918 --> 00:04:44.886
How about you just
point that somewhere else?

26
00:04:45.388 --> 00:04:47.328
Stay there.
Fine.

27
00:04:52.126 --> 00:04:54.632
Where did you get
that thing anyway?

28
00:04:54.667 --> 00:04:56.029
It was next to me
when I woke up.

29
00:04:56.064 --> 00:05:00.066
Anything else?
You got more pockets in those?

30
00:05:00.101 --> 00:05:01.342
Empty.

31
00:05:03.544 --> 00:05:05.577
Mmm. This okay?

32
00:05:06.074 --> 00:05:07.810
Huh? Yeah?

33
00:05:08.912 --> 00:05:10.109
Okay.

34
00:05:13.114 --> 00:05:15.422
In my pocket.
when I woke up.

35
00:05:16.117 --> 00:05:17.886
Matches.

36
00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:23.463
Everything else is gone.
My phone. my wallet.
Everything.

37
00:05:23.498 --> 00:05:25.927
This doesn't make any sense.
How did we get here?

38
00:05:27.128 --> 00:05:29.634
Like I said. I have no idea.

39
00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.373
But I don't intend on
sticking around to find out.

40
00:05:34.608 --> 00:05:35.805
I'm gonna go.

41
00:05:37.743 --> 00:05:39.611
You're free to come
with me if you want.

42
00:05:41.747 --> 00:05:43.615
No. I'm gonna stay here
and wait for help.

43
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.114
You think that's a good idea?

44
00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:50.622
And you think trusting you
is a better one?

45
00:05:52.527 --> 00:05:53.559
Hmm.

46
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.891
Fair enough.

47
00:06:04.231 --> 00:06:05.472
Okay.

48
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.546
Good luck. Sam.

49
00:06:14.945 --> 00:06:15.977
Wait.

50
00:06:30.565 --> 00:06:31.894
You keep the gun.

51
00:06:33.194 --> 00:06:34.732
I'm gonna stay
way out front.

52
00:06:36.571 --> 00:06:37.735
Let's leave it at that.

53
00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:11.736
Hey. hey.

54
00:07:16.743 --> 00:07:17.940
Hello!

55
00:07:17.975 --> 00:07:19.744
Really? Are you crazy?

56
00:07:24.014 --> 00:07:25.585
Anybody there?

57
00:07:27.083 --> 00:07:28.489
Over here!

58
00:07:31.252 --> 00:07:33.186
You have no idea
who's out there.

59
00:07:34.926 --> 00:07:37.762
I didn't know who you were.
You seem all right.

60
00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:57.243
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
Stop right there.

61
00:07:57.278 --> 00:08:00.015
-Take it easy.
-Who the hell are you?

62
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:02.050
-We're just trying
to get out of here.
-Oh. yeah?

63
00:08:03.757 --> 00:08:04.888
Prove it.

64
00:08:07.992 --> 00:08:11.290
I woke up in this field.
I started walking.

65
00:08:11.325 --> 00:08:12.566
Found her.

66
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.832
Now. here we are.

67
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.839
She's in the same boat.
Trust me.

68
00:08:28.782 --> 00:08:29.880
Fine.

69
00:08:32.247 --> 00:08:33.312
Okay!

70
00:08:34.953 --> 00:08:36.117
Come on out.

71
00:08:54.775 --> 00:08:55.972
What the fuck?

72
00:09:00.176 --> 00:09:01.274
Uh...

73
00:09:06.688 --> 00:09:07.819
I'm Tyler.

74
00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:09.722
This is Sam.

75
00:09:14.421 --> 00:09:15.662
I'm Ryan.

76
00:09:15.697 --> 00:09:17.664
Hey. Ryan.
Hi.

77
00:09:18.766 --> 00:09:19.963
This is Ethan.

78
00:09:19.998 --> 00:09:21.129
That's Denise.

79
00:09:25.971 --> 00:09:27.608
Well. that's nice.

80
00:09:30.679 --> 00:09:31.744
I found it.

81
00:09:34.012 --> 00:09:35.308
Lucky you.

82
00:09:39.215 --> 00:09:40.720
What did you find?

83
00:09:42.053 --> 00:09:45.384
I. uh...
I just woke up with. um...

84
00:09:47.696 --> 00:09:48.860
matches.

85
00:09:50.061 --> 00:09:51.863
I got this.

86
00:09:51.898 --> 00:09:54.228
She's got a knife.

87
00:09:54.263 --> 00:09:56.901
-They gave him a compass.
-Who are they?

88
00:09:56.936 --> 00:09:59.739
Well. that's
the million-dollar question
now. isn't it?

89
00:09:59.774 --> 00:10:04.073
My guess?
It's got something
to do with this.

90
00:10:04.108 --> 00:10:08.176
It's a symbol.
It's on all of our items.

91
00:10:16.153 --> 00:10:17.350
Well. I'll be.

92
00:10:19.893 --> 00:10:21.024
It's on mine too.

93
00:10:22.093 --> 00:10:26.997
Look. we've been
staying on point
using his compass.

94
00:10:27.032 --> 00:10:29.868
We've gone about three klicks.
We are bound to find something.

95
00:10:32.037 --> 00:10:33.432
Makes sense.

96
00:10:35.172 --> 00:10:38.074
Can we just go? I'm thirsty.

97
00:10:45.853 --> 00:10:46.918
Hey.

98
00:10:47.756 --> 00:10:48.788
Look.

99
00:10:50.055 --> 00:10:51.318
Stronger as a group.

100
00:10:54.323 --> 00:10:55.421
We'll follow.

101
00:10:56.798 --> 00:10:58.699
Great. Let's go.
All right.

102
00:11:09.437 --> 00:11:10.843
You good with this?

103
00:11:11.345 --> 00:11:12.845
Like I have a choice?

104
00:12:25.414 --> 00:12:27.348
What was that?

105
00:12:27.383 --> 00:12:28.987
I don't know.

106
00:12:29.022 --> 00:12:30.483
Can anyone tell
where that came from?

107
00:12:30.518 --> 00:12:33.321
Sounds like
it came from all over.

108
00:12:38.592 --> 00:12:40.229
Maybe he knows.

109
00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.539
It's like a scarecrow.
right?

110
00:12:55.246 --> 00:12:57.180
Maybe we're just
in a farmer's field.

111
00:12:59.888 --> 00:13:02.823
Honestly.
you ever seen
anything like this?

112
00:13:04.222 --> 00:13:06.090
I can't say
that I have.

113
00:13:06.125 --> 00:13:07.927
When I was a kid.
my dad used to take us on--

114
00:13:07.962 --> 00:13:09.192
Hold on.

115
00:13:09.227 --> 00:13:11.161
What was that?
Shh.

116
00:13:18.203 --> 00:13:20.236
Where am I? Stay back.

117
00:13:20.271 --> 00:13:22.502
What the hell is that?

118
00:13:22.537 --> 00:13:25.505
It's okay.
No one is gonna hurt you.

119
00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:29.575
-Something tells me
you woke up in this field

120
00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:31.610
and you have no idea
how you got here.

121
00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:34.184
Just tell us
what you remember.

122
00:13:34.681 --> 00:13:38.122
I. um... I was...

123
00:13:38.157 --> 00:13:42.929
Um. I was in my flat writing--
writing yearly conditions and...

124
00:13:44.229 --> 00:13:46.900
Uh-- And then
that's all I remember.

125
00:13:46.935 --> 00:13:49.331
I must have crashed
really hard.
Writing what?

126
00:13:51.137 --> 00:13:54.039
Code. If blue is the sky...

127
00:13:55.471 --> 00:13:57.240
What did you get?

128
00:13:57.275 --> 00:14:01.508
What? I didn't get anything.
It's just what I do.

129
00:14:01.543 --> 00:14:04.511
No. What did you
wake up with?

130
00:14:05.217 --> 00:14:06.381
Uh--

131
00:14:07.483 --> 00:14:09.318
We all woke up
with something.

132
00:14:12.125 --> 00:14:13.894
Well.
I don't have anything.

133
00:14:15.458 --> 00:14:17.293
Nothing?

134
00:14:17.328 --> 00:14:23.266
No. I woke up.
I heard the siren.
and then I started running.

135
00:14:24.566 --> 00:14:26.698
Are you sure?
Mm-hmm.

136
00:14:26.733 --> 00:14:30.306
Because that makes you
the only one without an item.

137
00:14:30.341 --> 00:14:32.374
and I'm not buying it.
Whoa!

138
00:14:32.409 --> 00:14:34.574
Back off.
She said she doesn't
have anything.

139
00:14:36.413 --> 00:14:38.083
I don't trust her.

140
00:14:38.118 --> 00:14:41.350
I just-- I just want
to get out of here.

141
00:14:42.089 --> 00:14:43.220
Whatever.

142
00:14:45.092 --> 00:14:46.322
This way.
Great.

143
00:14:55.564 --> 00:14:58.004
He'll calm down.

144
00:14:58.039 --> 00:15:00.204
I'd say this is new territory
for everyone.

145
00:15:01.009 --> 00:15:02.206
Just stick with us.

146
00:15:04.375 --> 00:15:06.309
Yeah.
You okay?

147
00:15:12.779 --> 00:15:14.053
I know.

148
00:15:46.153 --> 00:15:47.251
Here.

149
00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:15.411
So who's your pick?

150
00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.117
My pick?

151
00:16:18.152 --> 00:16:19.613
Who brought us here?

152
00:16:20.215 --> 00:16:22.616
Obviously.
it wasn't Ethan.

153
00:16:22.651 --> 00:16:24.255
I don't think it was you.

154
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:26.521
I know it wasn't me.

155
00:16:27.821 --> 00:16:31.163
The jury is still out
on you. cowboy.

156
00:16:32.793 --> 00:16:34.760
You think
it was one of us?

157
00:16:34.795 --> 00:16:36.168
You don't?

158
00:16:38.403 --> 00:16:40.502
Those two are comfortable enough
to fall asleep.

159
00:16:40.537 --> 00:16:42.372
Sure sign of guilt.
if you ask me.

160
00:16:42.407 --> 00:16:44.242
Guilt?

161
00:16:45.044 --> 00:16:48.642
-They're all exhausted.
-And we're not?

162
00:16:49.678 --> 00:16:51.678
Could have been
any of us.

163
00:16:53.682 --> 00:16:55.418
Well. I know
it wasn't me.

164
00:17:01.228 --> 00:17:02.557
It's getting colder.

165
00:17:05.628 --> 00:17:07.463
What's with the outfit
anyway?

166
00:17:08.334 --> 00:17:09.531
Oh.

167
00:17:10.798 --> 00:17:14.371
-You mean my attire?

168
00:17:17.904 --> 00:17:20.113
My fiancé was working late.

169
00:17:20.841 --> 00:17:22.577
and I wanted
to surprise him.

170
00:17:23.712 --> 00:17:25.712
Rose petals. candles.

171
00:17:26.247 --> 00:17:28.352
me in bed wearing this.

172
00:17:28.915 --> 00:17:30.354
The whole bit.

173
00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:34.259
I must have fallen asleep.

174
00:17:34.294 --> 00:17:36.195
I'm sure
he would have loved it.

175
00:17:38.199 --> 00:17:39.363
You think?

176
00:17:40.465 --> 00:17:42.333
Absolutely.

177
00:17:59.913 --> 00:18:01.880
What the hell is that?

178
00:18:03.785 --> 00:18:05.158
Oh. my God.
What?

179
00:18:05.193 --> 00:18:06.225
One. two. three...

180
00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:07.622
What?

181
00:18:07.657 --> 00:18:08.722
Hey. hey.

182
00:18:11.199 --> 00:18:12.726
One. two. three. four...

183
00:18:12.761 --> 00:18:14.926
-Are you okay?
-One. two. three.
four. five. six.

184
00:18:14.961 --> 00:18:16.928
Hey. Let us help you.
all right?

185
00:18:16.963 --> 00:18:19.766
It's the same. It's the same.

186
00:18:21.374 --> 00:18:23.242
There's something
in the field.

187
00:18:23.277 --> 00:18:26.212
Come with us.
We'll find a way out.

188
00:18:26.247 --> 00:18:27.510
There is no way out.

189
00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.560
We need to get
the fuck out of here!

190
00:18:52.504 --> 00:18:53.932
Help me.

191
00:18:56.937 --> 00:18:58.838
-Just stay with him.
Stay with him.
-Okay.

192
00:19:14.856 --> 00:19:16.262
Oh. God.

193
00:19:34.007 --> 00:19:36.777
You're a real piece of shit.
You know that?

194
00:19:37.613 --> 00:19:39.978
You knocked me on my ass
and left me to die.

195
00:19:40.013 --> 00:19:41.848
you spineless little fuck.

196
00:19:43.852 --> 00:19:47.260
Denise. I'm sorry. I--

197
00:19:51.563 --> 00:19:55.334
Just stay still. okay?
Okay.

198
00:19:55.369 --> 00:19:57.501
Maybe we should--
Maybe we should just--

199
00:19:57.536 --> 00:19:59.338
Don't touch it.
Please don't touch it.
Okay.

200
00:19:59.373 --> 00:20:01.406
Don't touch it. please.
Okay. Okay. okay.

201
00:20:03.971 --> 00:20:06.576
Stop moving.
I think you're making it worse.

202
00:20:06.611 --> 00:20:07.973
It's not that.

203
00:20:11.011 --> 00:20:14.551
I just remembered the last time
I saw my girlfriend.

204
00:20:14.586 --> 00:20:17.818
We had an argument
about nothing really.

205
00:20:17.853 --> 00:20:19.886
and she stormed
out of the flat.

206
00:20:21.461 --> 00:20:23.692
And I just kept coding.

207
00:20:26.697 --> 00:20:30.567
And then the next thing you know
is that I wake up here.

208
00:20:30.602 --> 00:20:31.799
I'm so sorry.

209
00:20:33.099 --> 00:20:34.967
There you are.

210
00:20:37.103 --> 00:20:38.740
What the hell happened to her?

211
00:20:39.709 --> 00:20:43.074
We were running together
and we didn't see the fence.

212
00:20:45.045 --> 00:20:46.583
She's hurt.

213
00:20:46.618 --> 00:20:50.752
Well. I'm not surprised.

214
00:20:50.787 --> 00:20:53.689
See what you can do for her
until we find the doc. okay?

215
00:20:53.724 --> 00:20:54.921
Yeah.

216
00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:22.718
Hey. hey.

217
00:21:22.753 --> 00:21:24.786
You fucking left us!

218
00:21:24.821 --> 00:21:26.524
Hey.
No. Fuck you!

219
00:21:26.559 --> 00:21:28.625
Ethan. Ethan.

220
00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:31.958
I can't do this.
I can't. I can't.

221
00:21:31.993 --> 00:21:35.401
I just--
I don't want to be here.
I don't want to be here.

222
00:21:35.436 --> 00:21:39.669
Hey. hey. Ethan. Ethan.
It's okay. It's okay. Okay?

223
00:21:39.704 --> 00:21:42.375
We're going to get out of here.
Whatever that thing is.
it's gone now.

224
00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:44.069
We're gonna be home soon. okay?

225
00:21:44.104 --> 00:21:46.874
I haven't been home
since my mom died
two years ago.

226
00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:49.613
My dad doesn't care about me.
He just leaves me
at school to rot.

227
00:21:49.648 --> 00:21:50.779
Shh. shh.

228
00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:53.947
I miss my mom.

229
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:59.458
Do you still have
that compass?

230
00:22:06.995 --> 00:22:11.030
Here. you see that needle?
It's going to lead us
out of here.

231
00:22:11.065 --> 00:22:12.405
Do you really think so?

232
00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.934
I know so.

233
00:22:15.003 --> 00:22:16.673
You just need to
stay strong.

234
00:22:16.708 --> 00:22:19.005
and we're gonna
get through this together. okay?

235
00:22:21.977 --> 00:22:23.416
You got this. bud.

236
00:22:24.749 --> 00:22:26.452
We can't do this
without you.

237
00:22:45.165 --> 00:22:46.505
There.

238
00:22:49.939 --> 00:22:51.576
Come on.

239
00:22:54.581 --> 00:22:56.482
It's okay.
Here come the others.

240
00:22:56.946 --> 00:22:58.110
Let me through.

241
00:22:58.915 --> 00:23:00.651
It looks pretty bad.

242
00:23:00.686 --> 00:23:02.587
Okay. Let me take a look.
That hurts!

243
00:23:02.622 --> 00:23:04.721
You need to keep it down.
We don't know where
that thing is.

244
00:23:04.756 --> 00:23:06.492
Hey. hey. hey. Over here.

245
00:23:06.527 --> 00:23:08.791
I need you to relax. okay?
Just look at me.

246
00:23:08.826 --> 00:23:11.860
Can you take one deep breath
for me and hold it?

247
00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.962
Now-- Now exhale slowly.

248
00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:20.869
You're lucky.
It's not in the lung.

249
00:23:20.904 --> 00:23:23.168
So. I'm all right? Huh?

250
00:23:23.203 --> 00:23:25.577
No! What are you doing?
Don't touch it. I'm good.

251
00:23:25.612 --> 00:23:26.974
I can manage.
It needs to be removed.

252
00:23:27.009 --> 00:23:28.206
No. no. no. I'm good.

253
00:23:28.241 --> 00:23:30.516
I'm good. I can manage.

254
00:23:30.551 --> 00:23:32.518
-Take this.
-I'm fine. Please stop.
Stop. I'm fine.

255
00:23:32.553 --> 00:23:34.982
-Cameron. Cameron.
-Forget the--
Don't touch me!

256
00:23:35.017 --> 00:23:37.490
We need to do something
about this noise. Denise?

257
00:23:37.525 --> 00:23:41.153
No! Don't. please.

258
00:23:41.188 --> 00:23:42.957
-I'm sorry.

259
00:23:42.992 --> 00:23:45.630
-I need you to trust me.
-No. please! Please.

260
00:23:55.906 --> 00:23:58.269
Hey. How's she doing?

261
00:23:58.304 --> 00:23:59.776
She's okay.

262
00:23:59.811 --> 00:24:02.141
All right. Well.
if she can't keep up.

263
00:24:03.815 --> 00:24:05.518
we'll help her.

264
00:24:05.553 --> 00:24:07.685
No one gets left behind.

265
00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.884
I like that plan.

266
00:24:10.085 --> 00:24:11.986
We need water.
Yeah.

267
00:24:12.021 --> 00:24:13.856
You couldn't be
more right.

268
00:24:14.958 --> 00:24:16.859
That man
from last night...

269
00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:23.063
he had all
the same items as us.

270
00:24:23.098 --> 00:24:25.230
You think there's
others out here?

271
00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.870
Definitely.

272
00:24:27.905 --> 00:24:29.036
What. you think?

273
00:24:30.809 --> 00:24:32.105
Oh. hell. who knows.

274
00:24:33.041 --> 00:24:36.615
This whole situation
is fucked if you ask me.

275
00:24:37.112 --> 00:24:38.518
It really is.

276
00:24:40.181 --> 00:24:41.213
Okay.

277
00:24:42.722 --> 00:24:44.216
Let's go wake them up.

278
00:24:54.767 --> 00:24:55.832
You good?

279
00:24:56.802 --> 00:24:59.539
I'm good. Thanks.

280
00:25:32.838 --> 00:25:34.937
How far have we gone?

281
00:25:34.972 --> 00:25:36.774
I don't know.

282
00:25:36.809 --> 00:25:38.974
You would think we'd have
found something by now.

283
00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:44.683
Anyone back home wondering
where you are?

284
00:25:48.216 --> 00:25:49.589
Um...

285
00:25:51.021 --> 00:25:52.350
Folks have passed.

286
00:25:52.385 --> 00:25:55.155
Uh. I used to be married.

287
00:25:56.257 --> 00:25:59.698
Now divorced. Um...

288
00:25:59.733 --> 00:26:04.670
I did get
a beautiful little girl
out of the deal. though.

289
00:26:04.705 --> 00:26:07.970
Pretty sure she's wondering
where I am right now.

290
00:26:10.073 --> 00:26:11.138
A little girl.

291
00:26:12.075 --> 00:26:13.239
She's seven.

292
00:26:14.242 --> 00:26:16.275
What's her name?

293
00:26:17.113 --> 00:26:19.311
Sedona Mackenzie.

294
00:26:19.346 --> 00:26:23.821
And she's just. well...
a wonder.

295
00:26:23.856 --> 00:26:25.988
Amazes me
in every single way.

296
00:26:27.761 --> 00:26:28.991
That's quite a name.

297
00:26:30.731 --> 00:26:32.192
Siddy Mac for short.

298
00:26:32.794 --> 00:26:34.931
That's very Texas.
Very.

299
00:26:37.298 --> 00:26:38.363
How about you?

300
00:26:39.839 --> 00:26:40.937
Just work.

301
00:26:43.744 --> 00:26:44.908
That sounds lonely.

302
00:26:48.045 --> 00:26:49.847
My mom died
when I was young.

303
00:26:49.882 --> 00:26:52.377
I lost my dad
earlier this year.

304
00:26:52.412 --> 00:26:57.921
I work 36-hour shifts.
so no time for friends
or relationships.

305
00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:01.254
Well. nothing that sticks.

306
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:05.357
What's the last thing
you remember?

307
00:27:07.031 --> 00:27:09.966
Falling asleep
in the on-call room.

308
00:27:10.001 --> 00:27:13.266
Laid down to catch a few Z's
and next thing you know. I...

309
00:27:15.039 --> 00:27:16.104
What is it?

310
00:27:18.042 --> 00:27:20.878
Someone had to have come
in there. have access.

311
00:27:20.913 --> 00:27:24.343
drug me and take me
out of the hospital
without anyone noticing.

312
00:27:24.378 --> 00:27:26.015
Who could do that?

313
00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:27.280
The government.

314
00:27:29.284 --> 00:27:32.450
Governments have been running
these kinds of experiments
for years.

315
00:27:33.761 --> 00:27:35.321
You think
this whole thing's a test?

316
00:27:35.356 --> 00:27:37.928
I've run data collation
and analysis
for the Pentagon

317
00:27:37.963 --> 00:27:39.996
that only comes from
this type of activity.

318
00:27:40.031 --> 00:27:44.066
Whoa. whoa. whoa. What?
You work for the Pentagon?

319
00:27:47.236 --> 00:27:52.074
You're talking about
reprogramming.
selective memory erasure.

320
00:27:52.109 --> 00:27:54.439
chemical therapy.
micro-implants.

321
00:27:54.474 --> 00:27:57.409
PTSD experimental
memory treatments.

322
00:27:59.116 --> 00:28:01.820
-Yeah.
-What the fuck are you two
talking about?

323
00:28:03.989 --> 00:28:06.517
Are you okay?
Yeah. yeah. yeah.
I just need to rest.

324
00:28:06.552 --> 00:28:08.992
No. No.
We're not stopping.

325
00:28:09.027 --> 00:28:10.323
I need to go
to the bathroom.

326
00:28:10.358 --> 00:28:12.325
And honestly. I could do
with a minute alone.

327
00:28:12.965 --> 00:28:14.030
Jesus Christ.

328
00:28:14.065 --> 00:28:15.394
Let's take five.

329
00:28:16.496 --> 00:28:17.902
Okay?

330
00:28:21.006 --> 00:28:22.907
-I'm going too.
-I'll come.

331
00:28:23.877 --> 00:28:25.008
I have to go too.

332
00:28:28.079 --> 00:28:29.474
Stay close.

333
00:28:33.821 --> 00:28:35.986
You good.
or you got to go?

334
00:28:36.021 --> 00:28:39.759
No fluids for a day and a half.
Nothing in. nothing out.

335
00:28:41.895 --> 00:28:44.423
Maybe there's
something in the corn.

336
00:28:47.263 --> 00:28:48.768
Some water. you know.

337
00:28:56.008 --> 00:28:57.304
It's rotten.

338
00:28:58.571 --> 00:28:59.812
It's all the same.

339
00:29:00.947 --> 00:29:03.211
What the hell was
Denise rambling about?

340
00:29:07.283 --> 00:29:10.790
I'm telling you.
it's all about
instinct for me.

341
00:29:12.288 --> 00:29:13.859
Gotta trust your gut.

342
00:29:15.291 --> 00:29:16.862
You all right there. chief?

343
00:29:18.866 --> 00:29:20.261
Something's not right.

344
00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:25.035
You know what I don't trust?

345
00:29:25.873 --> 00:29:26.938
What's that?

346
00:29:28.975 --> 00:29:30.073
Cameron.

347
00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.256
Motherfucker.

348
00:29:50.931 --> 00:29:52.095
Give me that.

349
00:29:54.099 --> 00:29:55.395
See? I fucking knew it.

350
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:57.463
Huh?

351
00:29:57.498 --> 00:29:59.531
What did you expect me
to do?

352
00:30:01.139 --> 00:30:02.908
Settle down. bud.

353
00:30:02.943 --> 00:30:05.075
She deserved it!
She's hurt.

354
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:06.571
She's holding out on us. man.

355
00:30:09.444 --> 00:30:12.412
-She had water!
-You need to calm down.

356
00:30:12.447 --> 00:30:14.414
She had water
the whole fucking time!

357
00:30:14.449 --> 00:30:16.482
What did you expect me
to do. huh?

358
00:30:16.517 --> 00:30:19.188
What. hand it over
'cause you said
we're a team?

359
00:30:19.223 --> 00:30:23.522
You think I don't know
how this goes? It's been
the same way my whole life.

360
00:30:23.557 --> 00:30:25.898
"Fuck her.
I'll just take her shit.

361
00:30:25.933 --> 00:30:28.131
-And there's nothing
she can do about it."
-Don't give me that shit.

362
00:30:28.166 --> 00:30:30.331
We've been trying to help you.
We've been trying
to protect you.

363
00:30:30.366 --> 00:30:33.136
So I'm supposed to suddenly
just trust you with my life?

364
00:30:33.171 --> 00:30:36.370
How do I know
you're not the one
who did this to us?

365
00:30:36.405 --> 00:30:39.472
Uh-huh.
Are you fucking kidding me?

366
00:30:39.507 --> 00:30:42.046
Yeah. yeah. yeah.
I did what I had to do
to take care of myself.

367
00:30:43.643 --> 00:30:46.446
Look. she's scared.
What. are you on her side?

368
00:30:46.481 --> 00:30:51.022
It was only half full anyway.
There wasn't enough
for everyone.

369
00:30:52.289 --> 00:30:53.420
How much is left?

370
00:30:56.557 --> 00:30:58.491
No. no. don't stop now.

371
00:30:59.527 --> 00:31:00.559
Tell him.

372
00:31:04.697 --> 00:31:05.938
None.

373
00:31:07.205 --> 00:31:08.435
What's wrong with you?

374
00:31:16.511 --> 00:31:17.675
Denise.

375
00:31:33.429 --> 00:31:35.000
Sam?

376
00:31:36.003 --> 00:31:37.134
Sam?

377
00:31:42.042 --> 00:31:43.404
Ethan?

378
00:31:52.547 --> 00:31:53.744
Help!

379
00:31:53.779 --> 00:31:55.251
Help!
Denise! Fuck.

380
00:31:56.518 --> 00:31:59.420
-No. it's this way!
-Sam! Sam!

381
00:31:59.455 --> 00:32:01.323
Denise!
Shit.

382
00:32:06.792 --> 00:32:08.231
Denise!

383
00:32:10.598 --> 00:32:11.663
Sam!

384
00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.588
-Shit.
-Sam!

385
00:32:36.459 --> 00:32:37.491
Sam!

386
00:32:39.264 --> 00:32:40.692
Where are you guys?

387
00:32:40.727 --> 00:32:42.133
We're over here!

388
00:32:52.343 --> 00:32:55.608
-This is her fault.
-What? Why would you
even say that?

389
00:32:55.643 --> 00:32:57.742
Stop! We have to go
look for her.

390
00:32:57.777 --> 00:32:59.612
No. no. no.
Whatever that thing is.

391
00:32:59.647 --> 00:33:02.219
it's close
and it's coming for us next.

392
00:33:06.522 --> 00:33:09.292
Staying here would be
a big mistake.

393
00:33:10.427 --> 00:33:12.427
We need to stick together.

394
00:33:12.462 --> 00:33:15.100
She can't be far.
Look. I like her too.

395
00:33:15.135 --> 00:33:17.267
But I don't want to be here
when that thing comes back.

396
00:33:17.302 --> 00:33:20.105
Yeah. Ethan. let's go.

397
00:33:22.208 --> 00:33:24.175
Please. Come on.

398
00:33:28.412 --> 00:33:30.478
We can't just leave.
We can't.

399
00:33:30.513 --> 00:33:33.085
I don't think
we have a choice.

400
00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:36.253
I'm sorry.
We're better off
sticking together.

401
00:33:36.288 --> 00:33:38.123
I'm not so sure
about that.

402
00:33:58.673 --> 00:34:00.739
What's wrong
with this thing?

403
00:34:00.774 --> 00:34:05.150
-What? What is it?
-This thing is...

404
00:34:05.185 --> 00:34:07.350
I-- I don't know.
It's been pointing north.
Now it's--

405
00:34:07.385 --> 00:34:09.187
Are you sure
you're reading it right?
Let me see.

406
00:34:09.222 --> 00:34:10.287
Yes. I'm reading it right.

407
00:34:10.322 --> 00:34:12.124
Are you sure about that?

408
00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:15.259
Because you just said north.
and you've had us going south.

409
00:34:15.294 --> 00:34:18.262
-What?
-That's west.

410
00:34:18.297 --> 00:34:21.793
-We've been following
the needle.
-And that's south.

411
00:34:21.828 --> 00:34:23.729
What's your problem?

412
00:34:26.932 --> 00:34:28.371
Oh. no.

413
00:34:31.904 --> 00:34:33.409
That's impossible.

414
00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:35.642
Fuck.

415
00:34:53.695 --> 00:34:55.299
This--
This can't be right.

416
00:34:55.334 --> 00:34:56.630
Perfect.

417
00:34:56.665 --> 00:34:59.369
You've had us
walking around in circles.

418
00:34:59.404 --> 00:35:02.471
Get that fucking finger
out of my face. you idiot.

419
00:35:02.506 --> 00:35:04.242
-Hey. hey. hey!

420
00:35:04.277 --> 00:35:06.277
-You little shit.
-Hey.

421
00:35:06.807 --> 00:35:07.938
All right?

422
00:35:07.973 --> 00:35:09.610
Hey. what's this?

423
00:35:11.416 --> 00:35:12.448
Oh. my God.

424
00:35:14.782 --> 00:35:16.254
There's no handle.

425
00:35:16.289 --> 00:35:17.882
Watch out. Watch out.

426
00:35:26.464 --> 00:35:27.661
Let me try?

427
00:35:52.721 --> 00:35:56.690
Okay. okay. Come on. Come on.

428
00:35:56.725 --> 00:35:59.726
The compass
wasn't leading us south.
It was leading us here.

429
00:35:59.761 --> 00:36:01.431
To this faucet.

430
00:36:02.962 --> 00:36:05.666
You think
we're supposed to find this?

431
00:36:07.769 --> 00:36:08.867
I do.

432
00:36:10.035 --> 00:36:11.771
So what now?

433
00:36:12.873 --> 00:36:14.642
Ryan. can you
look at the bottle?

434
00:36:17.383 --> 00:36:18.844
It's a tree. So what?

435
00:36:18.879 --> 00:36:20.747
No. it's not just a tree.
It is the tree.

436
00:36:22.421 --> 00:36:23.651
I don't get it.

437
00:36:23.686 --> 00:36:25.884
I've seen that tree.
this morning.

438
00:36:25.919 --> 00:36:27.622
This morning?
Yes.

439
00:36:28.625 --> 00:36:30.295
What are you saying?

440
00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:31.791
I'm saying
I think there is
more to these items

441
00:36:31.826 --> 00:36:33.023
than just
their obvious functions.

442
00:36:33.058 --> 00:36:34.695
Because of a tree
on a bottle?

443
00:36:39.834 --> 00:36:42.571
Okay. This isn't a compass.

444
00:36:42.606 --> 00:36:45.409
It's an indicator
designed to do one thing:

445
00:36:45.444 --> 00:36:47.741
lead us to this faucet
and then turn it on.

446
00:36:47.776 --> 00:36:51.382
That's why the needle
started spinning. because
we were right on top of it.

447
00:36:52.913 --> 00:36:56.387
The square on
the other one's shirt
isn't in the same place.

448
00:36:56.422 --> 00:36:59.951
It was closer
to the middle before.
Now it's further to the right.

449
00:36:59.986 --> 00:37:02.591
And the tree on the bottle.
it has to be the next clue.

450
00:37:02.626 --> 00:37:05.363
It's a puzzle.
Yes.

451
00:37:05.398 --> 00:37:06.727
So what are you thinking?

452
00:37:06.762 --> 00:37:09.026
I think we should go
back to the tree.

453
00:37:09.061 --> 00:37:11.600
What? That's absurd.

454
00:37:11.635 --> 00:37:14.834
You want to go backwards
because of a tree on a bottle.

455
00:37:14.869 --> 00:37:16.440
Not just the tree.
but yes.

456
00:37:16.475 --> 00:37:18.343
That doesn't make any sense.

457
00:37:18.378 --> 00:37:20.807
We should keep going
in the same direction.

458
00:37:20.842 --> 00:37:22.941
South. away from here.

459
00:37:31.589 --> 00:37:33.050
Who thinks
we should go back?

460
00:37:33.085 --> 00:37:35.426
I do.

461
00:37:35.461 --> 00:37:37.560
Okay.

462
00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:41.894
-We go back.
-Oh. my days.
Are you lot serious?

463
00:37:41.929 --> 00:37:43.566
This doesn't
make any sense.

464
00:37:43.601 --> 00:37:45.865
Plus. we have no way
of finding our way back.

465
00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.835
Sure we do.
Now we know the needle
points to the faucet.

466
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:50.969
we have a point of reference
using the compass.

467
00:37:51.004 --> 00:37:52.476
We were going south. right?

468
00:37:53.479 --> 00:37:55.809
This is a bad idea.

469
00:37:55.844 --> 00:37:58.548
All right then.
Let's keep moving.

470
00:38:00.387 --> 00:38:01.419
Okay.

471
00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:10.593
Hey. hey.
We're better as a group.

472
00:38:10.628 --> 00:38:12.826
We can look out
for each other.

473
00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:16.962
Come on.

474
00:38:30.076 --> 00:38:31.482
Oh. fuck.

475
00:38:46.433 --> 00:38:47.696
You coming or what?

476
00:38:50.701 --> 00:38:51.733
Yeah.

477
00:38:55.772 --> 00:38:56.870
Right behind you.

478
00:39:45.591 --> 00:39:47.690
-Shit.

479
00:39:51.597 --> 00:39:54.158
Are you all right?

480
00:39:54.193 --> 00:39:57.865
-How did-- How did you...
-Are you okay? Huh?

481
00:40:01.838 --> 00:40:03.475
What the hell is that?

482
00:40:05.545 --> 00:40:10.515
It's a trap.
Are you kidding?
Fucking traps?

483
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:13.980
Someone spent a lot of time
working on these.
Why?

484
00:40:14.015 --> 00:40:18.688
I don't know. My guess
is to kill that thing
that's hunting us.

485
00:40:18.723 --> 00:40:20.690
It's going to be dark soon.

486
00:40:20.725 --> 00:40:23.726
And cold. All right.
another couple klicks.

487
00:40:23.761 --> 00:40:26.190
We're just gonna--
No. who put you
in charge? Huh?

488
00:40:26.225 --> 00:40:28.599
We need to turn back
and go south.

489
00:40:28.634 --> 00:40:30.128
Surely. you can't be
this fucking stupid.

490
00:40:34.904 --> 00:40:36.101
Hey!
Ryan!

491
00:40:36.136 --> 00:40:37.509
Hey!
Stop!

492
00:40:37.544 --> 00:40:39.269
Ryan! Put her down! Now!

493
00:40:39.304 --> 00:40:40.974
Ryan! Stop!

494
00:40:41.009 --> 00:40:45.077
-Ryan! Put her down! Now!
-Ryan!

495
00:40:45.112 --> 00:40:48.949
Ryan. put her down.
Put her down. Ryan.

496
00:40:58.026 --> 00:41:00.994
You're losing it. man.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

497
00:41:01.029 --> 00:41:03.535
-Let me help you.
Deep breath.
-Huh?

498
00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:06.164
What's wrong with him?
What's wrong with him?

499
00:41:06.199 --> 00:41:08.606
You're okay.
Keep him away from me.

500
00:41:08.641 --> 00:41:10.839
Ryan.

501
00:41:10.874 --> 00:41:13.138
Hey. where are you going?

502
00:41:15.879 --> 00:41:18.308
Ryan?
Tyler? Will you help me?

503
00:41:18.343 --> 00:41:19.584
Okay.

504
00:41:20.851 --> 00:41:22.213
Be right back.

505
00:41:22.248 --> 00:41:24.523
Hey. Be careful.

506
00:41:33.094 --> 00:41:35.534
This reminds me
of Afghanistan.

507
00:41:37.098 --> 00:41:38.735
The sky on fire.

508
00:41:39.903 --> 00:41:41.298
Terribly beautiful.

509
00:41:45.271 --> 00:41:47.106
I lost them all. you know.

510
00:41:49.847 --> 00:41:51.583
Every last one of them.

511
00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.214
My entire unit...

512
00:41:58.185 --> 00:42:01.923
was pinned down and wiped out
all because of me.

513
00:42:04.224 --> 00:42:08.600
As squad leader.
I made the heading choice...

514
00:42:13.068 --> 00:42:16.839
and I led us
right into an ambush.

515
00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:21.613
They didn't stand a chance.

516
00:42:24.915 --> 00:42:27.586
I am so sorry. Ryan...

517
00:42:29.282 --> 00:42:33.350
but I need you here
right now. with us.

518
00:42:41.096 --> 00:42:45.230
I've got to show you something.
but you gotta--

519
00:42:45.265 --> 00:42:47.870
you gotta promise
not to tell the others.

520
00:42:57.244 --> 00:42:58.980
I was injected...

521
00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:02.885
with whatever's in that.

522
00:43:17.297 --> 00:43:19.671
Just keep an eye on me.
all right?

523
00:43:21.268 --> 00:43:23.070
Something is...

524
00:43:28.781 --> 00:43:30.407
is-- is different.

525
00:44:03.277 --> 00:44:04.408
Holy shit.

526
00:44:09.822 --> 00:44:11.789
Okay.

527
00:44:11.824 --> 00:44:15.089
Okay. there has to be something.
The compass led us to water.

528
00:44:15.124 --> 00:44:17.124
The matches lit
the fire and lantern.

529
00:44:17.159 --> 00:44:18.488
The canteen led us here.

530
00:44:18.523 --> 00:44:20.798
It has to be here somewhere.

531
00:44:20.833 --> 00:44:24.934
It's just a tree.
A dead fucking tree.

532
00:44:31.173 --> 00:44:32.205
Anything?

533
00:44:33.846 --> 00:44:36.044
Oh. this was
such a waste of time.

534
00:44:36.079 --> 00:44:40.180
Now we're that much hungrier
and the entire day is gone.

535
00:44:40.215 --> 00:44:43.084
-Look. you didn't have
to come with us.
-I know.

536
00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:10.309
Hey. can you bring
that light over here?

537
00:45:34.874 --> 00:45:36.170
Is that a map?

538
00:45:39.604 --> 00:45:41.945
That is exactly what it is.

539
00:45:42.442 --> 00:45:43.474
You see--

540
00:45:44.143 --> 00:45:47.819
You see here?
The fence line.

541
00:45:47.854 --> 00:45:51.988
That puts us. um.
here. I think.

542
00:45:52.023 --> 00:45:54.155
We need to focus
on what we know.

543
00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:57.994
So. look.
that would actually
put us here.

544
00:45:59.327 --> 00:46:02.130
You're right.
Look at this.

545
00:46:02.165 --> 00:46:04.363
With these grid lines.

546
00:46:04.398 --> 00:46:07.938
it would only make sense
if something else lined up.

547
00:46:09.205 --> 00:46:11.469
Something goes
on top of this.
Right.

548
00:46:11.504 --> 00:46:13.878
A-A-An overlay.

549
00:46:13.913 --> 00:46:16.078
It has to be here somewhere.

550
00:46:19.611 --> 00:46:20.852
Ryan.

551
00:46:22.581 --> 00:46:23.822
What is it?

552
00:46:25.386 --> 00:46:27.287
There's a shape
on top of this pole.

553
00:46:29.324 --> 00:46:30.488
Wait a second.

554
00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:43.138
Oh!

555
00:46:46.605 --> 00:46:49.507
-Y-You need to focus.
-Yeah. yeah. yeah. Okay.

556
00:46:49.542 --> 00:46:53.379
There. that's it!
But nothing lines up.

557
00:46:53.414 --> 00:46:54.446
Wait.

558
00:47:00.993 --> 00:47:02.289
Holy shit.

559
00:47:02.324 --> 00:47:04.027
Move it
a bit more to the right.

560
00:47:05.657 --> 00:47:07.228
Stop!

561
00:47:07.263 --> 00:47:09.329
No way.

562
00:47:09.364 --> 00:47:11.001
It's a path.
Right there.

563
00:47:11.036 --> 00:47:12.497
It has to be the way out.

564
00:47:12.532 --> 00:47:15.401
-Yeah.
-What. do you think or you know?

565
00:47:15.436 --> 00:47:17.535
We just have to get
the grid count
and direction right.

566
00:47:17.570 --> 00:47:19.911
and then follow it out.

567
00:47:19.946 --> 00:47:23.277
So look. if we go north
three fence lines.

568
00:47:23.312 --> 00:47:28.183
and then east two fence lines.
then north again to
this last grid square...

569
00:47:28.218 --> 00:47:32.088
That's-- That's where
the line ends. so I think
it's our way out of here.

570
00:47:34.653 --> 00:47:35.894
Shit.

571
00:47:36.688 --> 00:47:38.160
Tyler!

572
00:48:04.254 --> 00:48:05.924
Get up. all right?

573
00:48:06.553 --> 00:48:08.025
It's still out there.

574
00:48:29.279 --> 00:48:30.608
Do what you can for him.

575
00:48:30.643 --> 00:48:31.741
Where are you going?

576
00:48:31.776 --> 00:48:34.381
To kill that fucking thing.

577
00:48:35.186 --> 00:48:36.548
You okay?
Yeah.

578
00:48:36.583 --> 00:48:38.583
Okay. keep pressure there.
Let's go.

579
00:48:38.618 --> 00:48:41.223
Let's go. Come on. Come on.

580
00:48:41.258 --> 00:48:43.159
Come on.

581
00:48:58.638 --> 00:49:01.408
No. no. no. no. no. No.

582
00:49:23.828 --> 00:49:26.136
No. no. no.

583
00:49:27.799 --> 00:49:30.173
No. no. no. no. no.
Cameron.

584
00:49:32.639 --> 00:49:34.606
No. no. no.

585
00:49:41.846 --> 00:49:44.154
No. no. Ethan. No.

586
00:49:45.487 --> 00:49:47.322
Ethan. no. Please.

587
00:50:03.208 --> 00:50:06.440
I've got to take
your shirt off. okay?
Mm-hmm.

588
00:50:08.477 --> 00:50:12.215
Shit. Tyler.
Did you get a look at it?
No.

589
00:50:13.185 --> 00:50:14.778
-That bad?
-Oh. it's fine.

590
00:50:14.813 --> 00:50:17.781
Keep pressure here.
We have to stop the bleeding.

591
00:50:17.816 --> 00:50:21.686
I'm gonna tie this around now.
okay? One. two. three.

592
00:50:22.821 --> 00:50:24.755
We need to keep moving.

593
00:50:26.330 --> 00:50:29.430
What about the others?
They know to keep north.

594
00:50:29.465 --> 00:50:33.533
We're following
the fence lines on the map.
Now get up.

595
00:50:36.868 --> 00:50:39.275
Okay. let's go.

596
00:50:42.181 --> 00:50:45.281
Ethan. no. Please. no. no.

597
00:50:48.748 --> 00:50:50.484
What have you done. Cameron?

598
00:50:52.488 --> 00:50:54.653
I didn't see him.
I swear. I swear.

599
00:50:54.688 --> 00:50:56.886
I didn't. I-I didn't.

600
00:50:56.921 --> 00:51:00.329
He just came
out of nowhere. Please. no.
No. don't go. Don't go.

601
00:51:00.364 --> 00:51:02.859
Please don't leave me.
Shh...

602
00:51:04.566 --> 00:51:08.436
Please. Ryan.
you can't leave me!
Please. please. please.

603
00:52:01.590 --> 00:52:03.359
Please tell me
I'm not seeing that.

604
00:52:12.997 --> 00:52:15.866
These Mr. Creepys
are really starting
to freak me out.

605
00:52:18.838 --> 00:52:21.674
All the same.
he must be here for a reason.

606
00:52:21.709 --> 00:52:23.907
Yeah. to fuck with us.

607
00:52:26.549 --> 00:52:29.946
Okay. so these--
these are the fence lines.
which means--

608
00:52:29.981 --> 00:52:32.454
Oh. my God.
The shirt. The shirt.

609
00:52:32.489 --> 00:52:34.258
It's the pattern
from the tree.

610
00:52:34.293 --> 00:52:36.392
It was right in front of us
the whole time.

611
00:52:36.427 --> 00:52:39.329
Do you think
it's part of the map?
It's not part of. It is the map.

612
00:52:39.364 --> 00:52:42.794
Maybe it's the way out.
We need to get this off.

613
00:53:02.288 --> 00:53:03.848
See this square here?

614
00:53:03.883 --> 00:53:07.016
Here. this--
this is the first humanoid.

615
00:53:07.051 --> 00:53:10.987
And the second one.
this is where
we found the water.

616
00:53:11.022 --> 00:53:15.266
See? We crossed
all of these fence lines
and back from the water.

617
00:53:15.301 --> 00:53:16.993
which makes this one the tree.

618
00:53:17.028 --> 00:53:20.029
Which got us to this fence line.
the last grid on the tree map.

619
00:53:20.064 --> 00:53:22.504
which is where we are now.

620
00:53:22.539 --> 00:53:25.771
There has to be something
we're missing. We just need
to figure out what it is.

621
00:53:34.584 --> 00:53:35.649
Okay.

622
00:53:37.818 --> 00:53:39.686
What the hell
is this thing?

623
00:53:43.890 --> 00:53:45.362
There's something here.

624
00:53:46.332 --> 00:53:47.958
What is it?
I don't know.

625
00:53:47.993 --> 00:53:50.334
But it disappears
under the arm.

626
00:54:20.663 --> 00:54:22.696
That's the same
as the faucet.

627
00:54:32.243 --> 00:54:34.070
It's not coming back off.

628
00:54:43.114 --> 00:54:44.388
What is this?

629
00:54:44.423 --> 00:54:45.686
I'm not sure.

630
00:54:48.790 --> 00:54:51.362
The pattern
matches the switches.

631
00:54:51.397 --> 00:54:52.594
Huh?
Okay.

632
00:54:54.092 --> 00:54:55.795
See? They match.

633
00:54:55.830 --> 00:54:59.799
On. off. on. on.

634
00:54:59.834 --> 00:55:02.340
off. off. on.

635
00:55:29.996 --> 00:55:31.127
What do you think?

636
00:55:32.471 --> 00:55:33.866
I don't know.

637
00:55:35.639 --> 00:55:36.671
I don't know.

638
00:56:14.205 --> 00:56:15.842
What is this place?

639
00:56:48.646 --> 00:56:50.481
I think
we should go back.

640
00:56:50.516 --> 00:56:52.076
Back to where?

641
00:56:52.111 --> 00:56:54.243
Maybe there's
another way in.

642
00:56:56.753 --> 00:56:58.049
Shit.

643
00:57:08.633 --> 00:57:11.634
Okay. It's okay.
Let's stay calm.

644
00:57:11.669 --> 00:57:13.834
There's been a solution
to every puzzle.

645
00:57:14.639 --> 00:57:16.166
Right?
Right.

646
00:57:17.004 --> 00:57:18.707
We got this.

647
00:57:22.746 --> 00:57:24.845
Okay?

648
00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:26.583
Okay. let's do this.

649
00:57:44.328 --> 00:57:47.868
Let's just see what's
at the end of these and we'll
meet right back here. Okay?

650
00:57:47.903 --> 00:57:48.968
Okay.

651
00:58:02.951 --> 00:58:04.621
What do you see?

652
00:58:04.656 --> 00:58:07.855
Mine's about ten feet down.
and a left.

653
00:58:07.890 --> 00:58:10.858
Mine's a right.
Okay. we should stick together.

654
00:58:10.893 --> 00:58:13.091
Let's just go
right back to the middle
and we'll keep going.

655
00:58:15.194 --> 00:58:17.260
-Tyler!
-Sam!

656
00:58:17.295 --> 00:58:20.065
Tyler!
Sam!

657
00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:23.167
Okay. focus.
There's gotta be something.
There's gotta be something.

658
00:58:26.711 --> 00:58:28.579
Come on. come on.

659
00:58:29.076 --> 00:58:30.075
Oh!

660
00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:33.111
The symbol. Okay. okay.

661
00:58:34.114 --> 00:58:36.851
Sam!
Tyler. No. No. No.

662
00:58:36.886 --> 00:58:38.281
Tyler. I'm coming!

663
00:58:38.316 --> 00:58:40.151
Tyler. Tyler!

664
00:58:41.924 --> 00:58:43.660
Fuck. Fuck.

665
00:58:44.729 --> 00:58:46.223
Come on. come on.

666
00:58:47.996 --> 00:58:49.831
Yes.

667
00:58:53.298 --> 00:58:54.671
Tyler!

668
00:59:12.856 --> 00:59:13.888
Hey.

669
00:59:17.894 --> 00:59:19.223
That seriously sucked.

670
00:59:22.701 --> 00:59:24.030
Let me take a look here.

671
00:59:25.704 --> 00:59:27.671
I know. I know.

672
00:59:29.202 --> 00:59:31.136
You need fresh bandages.
Okay.

673
00:59:38.376 --> 00:59:40.013
Keep your hand here.

674
00:59:40.048 --> 00:59:43.016
Okay.
Not ideal. but it'll work.

675
00:59:43.051 --> 00:59:44.853
Okay. Okay.

676
00:59:48.727 --> 00:59:49.924
What is this?

677
00:59:56.262 --> 00:59:57.635
What is that?

678
00:59:58.231 --> 01:00:00.165
I have no idea.

679
01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:05.742
I think it's a map.

680
01:00:08.010 --> 01:00:09.042
Of what?

681
01:00:10.144 --> 01:00:11.275
This maze.

682
01:00:14.148 --> 01:00:18.018
It's like parts
are missing. though.
It doesn't make any sense.

683
01:00:21.892 --> 01:00:22.957
The card.

684
01:00:33.068 --> 01:00:34.100
This lines up.

685
01:00:34.905 --> 01:00:36.234
No way.

686
01:00:36.269 --> 01:00:40.238
The red markings.
These must be the traps.

687
01:00:40.273 --> 01:00:43.846
Why would you even trust this?
Why would it be here?

688
01:00:43.881 --> 01:00:46.310
Maybe they figure
if you make it this far?

689
01:00:48.985 --> 01:00:51.986
If you were alone.
that cord is the only way
to pull yourself out.

690
01:00:52.021 --> 01:00:53.218
If I was alone.

691
01:00:54.353 --> 01:00:55.385
I'd be dead.

692
01:00:57.191 --> 01:00:59.961
Okay. Let's do this.

693
01:00:59.996 --> 01:01:01.358
Yeah.

694
01:01:01.393 --> 01:01:02.425
All right.

695
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.032
I know.

696
01:01:06.464 --> 01:01:08.970
That's good. Okay.

697
01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:41.332
Okay.

698
01:02:33.089 --> 01:02:34.187
Hello?

699
01:02:38.589 --> 01:02:42.162
Is anyone there?

700
01:03:41.058 --> 01:03:42.321
What is this?

701
01:03:45.095 --> 01:03:46.556
Only one way to find out.

702
01:04:17.523 --> 01:04:19.655
It's some kind
of machine.

703
01:04:23.694 --> 01:04:27.135
Okay. guess that
would have been too easy.

704
01:04:28.303 --> 01:04:29.533
There's always an answer.

705
01:04:32.208 --> 01:04:33.438
The bullet.

706
01:04:43.681 --> 01:04:45.252
It's on.

707
01:04:47.157 --> 01:04:50.994
It's another card.
It's the same thing.
a switch pattern.

708
01:04:51.458 --> 01:04:52.490
Okay.

709
01:04:57.695 --> 01:05:00.267
-This has to work.

710
01:05:02.304 --> 01:05:05.008
What are we missing?

711
01:05:08.376 --> 01:05:09.606
Try the lever.

712
01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:16.283
Okay.

713
01:05:18.419 --> 01:05:20.320
Fuck.

714
01:05:20.355 --> 01:05:23.158
Other side.
Maybe they work together.

715
01:05:25.228 --> 01:05:28.526
-Oh...
-You need to take a break.

716
01:05:28.561 --> 01:05:32.398
Yeah. not a problem.

717
01:05:38.472 --> 01:05:40.307
There's a slot. right?

718
01:05:41.739 --> 01:05:44.212
-How did you know?
-Knife.

719
01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:49.679
It's the only thing
we haven't used
and don't have.

720
01:05:50.451 --> 01:05:52.418
So that's it?

721
01:05:52.453 --> 01:05:55.553
We tried.
It was a good effort.

722
01:05:57.524 --> 01:05:59.755
No. No. we have to go back.

723
01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:01.196
Go back?

724
01:06:02.166 --> 01:06:04.265
Where?

725
01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:07.763
I can't remember the last time
I'd seen the knife. Can you?

726
01:06:07.798 --> 01:06:09.237
Well. then
we're gonna find it.

727
01:06:09.272 --> 01:06:11.602
I've got nothing left
in the tank.

728
01:06:14.211 --> 01:06:16.673
I'll be back. I promise.

729
01:06:18.182 --> 01:06:19.412
I know you will.

730
01:07:12.467 --> 01:07:13.499
Okay.

731
01:08:09.227 --> 01:08:11.161
There they are.
There they are.

732
01:08:42.986 --> 01:08:44.557
No sound.

733
01:08:45.395 --> 01:08:46.823
Do you understand?

734
01:08:54.503 --> 01:08:55.733
What happened to you?

735
01:08:58.342 --> 01:08:59.473
Where are the others?

736
01:08:59.508 --> 01:09:00.606
Shh!

737
01:09:23.499 --> 01:09:25.202
I'm sorry.

738
01:09:26.436 --> 01:09:29.305
I'm sorry. You just--

739
01:09:29.868 --> 01:09:31.538
You have to be quiet.

740
01:09:34.444 --> 01:09:35.674
It's coming.

741
01:10:07.939 --> 01:10:10.313
You have to stay away from me.

742
01:10:16.354 --> 01:10:17.683
I need your help.

743
01:10:27.992 --> 01:10:30.498
The knife. Fuck it.

744
01:10:59.793 --> 01:11:01.331
Oh. my God.

745
01:11:25.390 --> 01:11:27.357
Help me. Please.
It's okay. I'm here.

746
01:11:27.392 --> 01:11:28.952
I don't want to die.
Shh! Shh!

747
01:11:28.987 --> 01:11:31.592
Please. I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.

748
01:11:31.627 --> 01:11:34.122
It's okay. I'm here. I'm here.
But you have to be quiet. Okay?

749
01:11:34.157 --> 01:11:35.629
You have to be quiet. okay?

750
01:11:35.664 --> 01:11:37.059
Don't leave me.
I won't.

751
01:11:46.136 --> 01:11:48.444
Oh. my God. You're human.

752
01:12:01.492 --> 01:12:02.953
Get the fuck outta here.

753
01:12:05.122 --> 01:12:07.760
You and I have
some unfinished business.

754
01:13:08.757 --> 01:13:12.561
Die. motherfucker!

755
01:13:23.035 --> 01:13:25.673
How the hell did you
last out here for so long?

756
01:13:50.799 --> 01:13:52.469
It's time to die.

757
01:14:32.643 --> 01:14:34.973
Tyler.
I've got the knife.

758
01:14:35.008 --> 01:14:38.647
Tyler? Tyler. wake up. Wake up.
We're getting out of here.

759
01:14:38.682 --> 01:14:39.714
Okay?

760
01:14:40.816 --> 01:14:41.848
Come on.

761
01:14:46.283 --> 01:14:48.558
Stay with me.
We're almost there.

762
01:14:55.699 --> 01:14:57.831
On three. Ready?

763
01:14:58.603 --> 01:14:59.899
I'm ready.

764
01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:03.903
One. two. three.

765
01:15:20.823 --> 01:15:24.088
No. No. No.

766
01:15:24.827 --> 01:15:25.925
No.

767
01:15:27.357 --> 01:15:29.027
No. no!

768
01:15:29.062 --> 01:15:30.567
No!

769
01:15:32.362 --> 01:15:33.603
No.

770
01:15:36.069 --> 01:15:37.739
They're fucking with us.

771
01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:40.709
It's just a game to them.

772
01:15:42.108 --> 01:15:44.240
I'm done
playing their game.

773
01:15:51.315 --> 01:15:52.347
Okay.

774
01:15:55.253 --> 01:15:56.593
Okay.

775
01:16:08.706 --> 01:16:09.738
Matches.

776
01:16:16.076 --> 01:16:18.846
I don't think this
is part of the puzzle.

777
01:16:19.783 --> 01:16:21.145
Fuck the puzzle.

778
01:17:20.008 --> 01:17:21.337
You beat 'em. you know.

779
01:17:32.053 --> 01:17:35.417
Just give me a minute to rest
and then we'll get out of here.

780
01:17:37.091 --> 01:17:40.026
You're going to make it
through this. Tyler.

781
01:17:40.061 --> 01:17:42.424
We're going to make it
through this together.

782
01:17:42.459 --> 01:17:43.931
Both of us.

783
01:17:44.633 --> 01:17:46.769
Think about
your little girl.

784
01:17:46.804 --> 01:17:49.002
She needs you.
She needs her--

785
01:18:24.842 --> 01:18:31.242
We... can... get... out.

786
01:18:31.277 --> 01:18:34.080
There is no way out.

787
01:19:49.421 --> 01:19:51.355
<i>Evac. transport. action one.</i>

788
01:19:51.390 --> 01:19:53.225
<i>Medical team.</i>
<i>prep for arrival...</i>

789
01:19:54.899 --> 01:19:56.327
<i>That's affirmative.</i>

790
01:19:56.362 --> 01:19:58.197
<i>Retrieve subjects</i>
<i>for phase two.</i>

791
01:19:59.596 --> 01:20:04.940
<i>Primary is priority.</i>
<i>Repeat. primary is priority.</i>

792
01:20:04.975 --> 01:20:07.107
<i>Green. green.</i>

793
01:20:07.142 --> 01:20:10.638
<i>Phase two. green.</i>
<i>Operation completion. green.</i>

794
01:20:10.673 --> 01:20:13.916
<i>Zone four active.</i>
<i>roger. confirmed.</i>

795
01:20:13.951 --> 01:20:16.314
<i>All subjects</i>
<i>are priority alpha.</i>

796
01:22:29.416 --> 01:22:32.483
One-- One--
One. two. three.
four. five. six.

797
01:22:34.223 --> 01:22:37.356
Same again. same again.
same again. same again. same...

798
01:22:38.524 --> 01:22:40.194
This whole thing...

799
01:22:43.661 --> 01:22:44.726
There is no way--

800
01:22:55.541 --> 01:22:57.145
Stop.
