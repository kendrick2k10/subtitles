00:02:08.197 --> 00:02:10.820
Nana! Nana!
Hurry up. I need a pee.

4
00:02:15.652 --> 00:02:17.102
Hurry. hurry.

5
00:02:17.965 --> 00:02:19.725
- Come on. Nana.

6
00:02:19.725 --> 00:02:22.694
Let me see you.

7
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.904
God knows what
she's come up with this time.

8
00:02:25.904 --> 00:02:27.595
Ma. we've been here ages.
Come on.

9
00:02:27.595 --> 00:02:29.666
- Ma. he's going to wet himself.

10
00:02:29.666 --> 00:02:32.290
Would you's ever wait?
I'm trying to do me hair.

11
00:02:32.876 --> 00:02:34.119
We've been waiting.

12
00:02:34.568 --> 00:02:36.811
- Would you hurry up?
I'm bursting.

13
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:38.330
We want to see you.
Come on out.

14
00:02:40.815 --> 00:02:42.990
- Are you's ready now?
Yes!

15
00:02:52.896 --> 00:02:54.691
- Jesus!
- What?

16
00:02:57.556 --> 00:02:58.833
Whoo-whoo!

17
00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.219
Open up. you bastard.

18
00:03:20.855 --> 00:03:22.409
I'll put it back.
God. I swear.

19
00:03:36.492 --> 00:03:37.458
Hiya. son.

20
00:03:40.323 --> 00:03:41.359
Hiya. Rosie.

21
00:03:43.188 --> 00:03:45.052
Are you hiding?
Where did Rosie go?

22
00:03:45.673 --> 00:03:47.054
Daniel. where's Rosie?

23
00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:50.195
- Jeez. give us a look at you.
- Wash your hands.

24
00:03:58.238 --> 00:03:59.239
George...

25
00:04:00.688 --> 00:04:02.103
have you any money?

26
00:04:02.103 --> 00:04:04.416
Why do you need it?
- Pilgrimage.

27
00:04:04.796 --> 00:04:06.038
What bleeding pilgrimage?

28
00:04:06.038 --> 00:04:07.799
We're entering
a talent contest.

29
00:04:08.696 --> 00:04:10.077
The winner gets two tickets

30
00:04:10.077 --> 00:04:11.665
to go to Lourdes
with the parish.

31
00:04:12.321 --> 00:04:15.116
Dolly. I don't care
what you do. win or lose.

32
00:04:15.116 --> 00:04:16.359
you're not taking
him to Lourdes.

33
00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.258
- Why not?
- Because I'm out there

34
00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:19.604
every day. breaking me bollocks

35
00:04:19.604 --> 00:04:21.157
and you want to give
our money to the church?

36
00:04:21.433 --> 00:04:23.332
- They have loads.
- We've been to all the doctors

37
00:04:23.332 --> 00:04:25.265
in Dublin. and they don't
know what's wrong with him.

38
00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.094
And some faker in Lourdes
is going to know?

39
00:04:27.094 --> 00:04:29.269
Miracles happen there. George.

40
00:04:30.925 --> 00:04:32.064
He could speak.

41
00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:34.274
That's all we want.

42
00:04:40.487 --> 00:04:41.902
We can't just give up on him.

43
00:04:42.661 --> 00:04:44.007
Look. maybe he doesn't
want to talk.

44
00:04:44.974 --> 00:04:46.251
That's fine with me.

45
00:04:48.667 --> 00:04:52.084
- Where's Rosie? Find Rosie.

46
00:04:56.744 --> 00:04:58.090
You going to feed the meter?

47
00:05:02.371 --> 00:05:05.132
Oh. Maureen.
the things I do for you.

48
00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:08.618
You're probably up there
in stitches. laughing at me.

49
00:05:10.517 --> 00:05:14.728
Let's see
if Tommy can do that.

50
00:05:32.884 --> 00:05:34.782
<i>And he said
"I heard you the first time."</i>

51
00:06:14.201 --> 00:06:16.686
Right. Here you are.
love. Mind how you go.

52
00:06:43.506 --> 00:06:44.645
Chrissie Aherne?

53
00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:48.269
- Father Dermot.
- Yeah.

54
00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:51.445
Thank you...

55
00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:53.965
for contacting me.

56
00:06:55.518 --> 00:06:58.487
I'm sorry I was too late.
My flight was cancelled.

57
00:06:58.487 --> 00:06:59.591
- I...
- You're here now.

58
00:07:00.212 --> 00:07:01.766
That's all that matters.

59
00:07:04.113 --> 00:07:06.391
Let me offer you
my heartfelt condolences.

60
00:07:06.874 --> 00:07:08.738
The death of a parent
is a terrible loss.

61
00:07:11.465 --> 00:07:12.432
I'm fine.

62
00:07:17.471 --> 00:07:20.716
- Big turnout for the vigil.
- Well now. you see.

63
00:07:21.302 --> 00:07:23.960
we have the Holy Cross All Stars
Talent Contest tonight.

64
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.306
It's been planned for months.

65
00:07:26.273 --> 00:07:29.069
It's a-- it's a
fundraiser for Lourdes.

66
00:07:30.242 --> 00:07:31.554
Your mother was on the committee

67
00:07:31.554 --> 00:07:33.556
and she worked so hard
to make it a success

68
00:07:33.556 --> 00:07:36.628
and everyone felt that she'd
want us to go ahead with it.

69
00:07:37.042 --> 00:07:39.597
We kind of feel it's sort
of like Maureen's wake.

70
00:07:41.978 --> 00:07:43.704
I hope you don't think
we're being insensitive.

71
00:07:44.533 --> 00:07:45.603
It's fine.

72
00:07:49.158 --> 00:07:50.780
May I have the keys
to the house. please?

73
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.851
I'm sorry. yeah. of course.

74
00:08:01.653 --> 00:08:03.655
-  There you go.
-  Thank you.

75
00:08:06.555 --> 00:08:08.004
- A lot of flowers.
- Hm.

76
00:08:10.248 --> 00:08:12.250
Let me know how much it cost.
I'll pay you back.

77
00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:13.734
The parish didn't pay
for the flowers.

78
00:08:15.287 --> 00:08:16.288
Who did it?

79
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.844
Your mother's friend. Lily Fox.

80
00:08:23.572 --> 00:08:25.194
- Tommy.
Yeah.

81
00:08:25.194 --> 00:08:28.853
Would you. would you give
me a hand with this zip?

82
00:08:28.853 --> 00:08:30.026
- I can't...
- Yeah.

83
00:08:30.786 --> 00:08:33.513
God be with the days
when somebody died.

84
00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:35.584
the whole street went dark.

85
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:40.002
Now. look at us. We're off
to do a bloody cabaret.

86
00:08:43.868 --> 00:08:45.041
How do I look?

87
00:08:45.594 --> 00:08:47.527
You look lovely.

88
00:08:52.566 --> 00:08:56.708
I went to visit Declan today.
asked him to bring us luck.

89
00:08:57.502 --> 00:08:59.228
You're not visiting
our son.

90
00:08:59.711 --> 00:09:01.886
you're visiting
a pile of bad memories

91
00:09:01.886 --> 00:09:05.061
stuffed with rocks and statues
that don't mean anything.

92
00:09:05.579 --> 00:09:08.927
I asked him to watch
over me tonight.

93
00:09:09.894 --> 00:09:11.896
What do you want to be
going to Lourdes for anyway?

94
00:09:13.794 --> 00:09:17.108
I've always wanted
to go there. all my life.

95
00:09:18.661 --> 00:09:22.631
And look. look. I'm
running out of chances.

96
00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.154
Can't catch me.
- I'll get you. Patrick.

97
00:09:29.154 --> 00:09:30.466
You're finished with him.

98
00:09:30.466 --> 00:09:32.606
Get back here.
- He's a waster. that fella.

99
00:09:32.606 --> 00:09:35.402
The sooner you get rid of him.
the better.

100
00:09:35.402 --> 00:09:36.955
I don't want to get
rid of him. Ma.

101
00:09:36.955 --> 00:09:38.370
Besides. where are you
going to live?

102
00:09:38.785 --> 00:09:40.269
Not here. We're bursting.

103
00:09:40.683 --> 00:09:42.305
We've put our names
down for a house.

104
00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:44.169
Maybe we'll get
Auntie Maureen's.

105
00:09:44.169 --> 00:09:47.207
Christ on a bike!
Can we bury her first?

106
00:09:49.623 --> 00:09:51.176
Where the hell are you going?

107
00:09:51.176 --> 00:09:52.971
Out.
You are on your arse.

108
00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.422
- I'm going to the pub.
- No. you're bloody-well not.

109
00:09:55.422 --> 00:09:56.768
You're minding
them kids for once.

110
00:09:57.251 --> 00:09:58.632
I'm going to the charity show.

111
00:09:59.115 --> 00:10:01.255
Sure. why do you want to win
a trip to bleeding Lourdes?

112
00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:02.774
I'm going out.

113
00:10:02.774 --> 00:10:04.500
One of these days
you'll come home.

114
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.329
and I won't be
shagging-well here.

115
00:10:06.329 --> 00:10:08.262
Promises. promises.

116
00:10:09.367 --> 00:10:12.128
- You're minding them kids.

117
00:10:12.128 --> 00:10:13.854
- I'm not minding them.
- Oh. yeah. you are.

118
00:10:13.854 --> 00:10:15.994

and do my hair.

Oh. just a little bump.

- Sore?

147
00:12:33.407 --> 00:12:35.962
- When you. when you touch it.
- I don't think so.

Well. if it was
the other way round.

00:12:49.044 --> 00:12:50.597
you'd should be in trouble.

154
00:12:50.597 --> 00:12:52.495

you have it.

Well.
let's hear it for The Miracles.

188
00:14:49.854 --> 00:14:51.649
Absolutely brilliant. ladies.

189
00:14:51.649 --> 00:14:53.996
- Well done. Enjoy your night.
- Thank you.

190
00:14:53.996 --> 00:14:56.343
Yes. yeah. thank you.

191
00:14:56.792 --> 00:15:01.797
That was great. honestly.
We'll win. I know it.

192
00:15:05.939 --> 00:15:07.078
I don't believe it.

193
00:15:08.424 --> 00:15:09.632
Mother of God.

194
00:15:10.426 --> 00:15:11.462
Who is it?

195
00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.843
Auntie Maureen's daughter.

196
00:15:13.843 --> 00:15:15.604
- Mrs. Aherne had a daughter?
Yeah.

197
00:15:15.604 --> 00:15:16.743
Risen from the dead.

198
00:15:20.609 --> 00:15:21.886
I wouldn't have recognized you.

199
00:15:22.956 --> 00:15:26.270
Okay. 40 years will do that
to you.

200
00:15:28.099 --> 00:15:29.583
It'll do a lot of things to you.

201
00:15:31.654 --> 00:15:35.451
Well. I'm sorry for your loss.

202
00:15:40.008 --> 00:15:42.976
Eileen. hi.

203
00:15:45.668 --> 00:15:46.842
Mm.

204
00:15:46.842 --> 00:15:49.362
Oh. you remember me. I was--
I was sure you wouldn't.

205
00:15:49.362 --> 00:15:51.812
- Yeah. who forgets family?
- Yeah. who does that?

206
00:15:58.785 --> 00:16:02.237
I'm Dolly Hennessey.
one of the neighbors.

207
00:16:02.996 --> 00:16:05.792
Very sorry for your loss.
Your Ma was a great neighbor.

208
00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:07.621
Thank you.

209
00:16:08.484 --> 00:16:10.072
It's very nice
to meet you. Dolly.

210
00:16:10.072 --> 00:16:13.041
- You were very good up there.
- Thank you.

211
00:16:13.489 --> 00:16:16.285
How much were the flowers?
I want to pay you back.

212
00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:18.874
I bought them for your mother.

213
00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.981
She didn't think you'd be here.

214
00:16:26.019 --> 00:16:27.434
Why would she think that?

215
00:16:27.434 --> 00:16:29.333
Have you ever come back
in 40 years?

216
00:16:34.476 --> 00:16:35.511
For the flowers.

217
00:16:41.241 --> 00:16:43.485
I don't need that.

218
00:16:45.107 --> 00:16:48.524
It was an honor.
Your mother was a saint.

219
00:17:02.883 --> 00:17:05.714
Well now. who'd have thunk it?

220
00:17:06.611 --> 00:17:08.544
Maureen's daughter.
and coming all this way.

221
00:17:09.269 --> 00:17:11.271
And only a little bit late.

222
00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:14.240
Yes. but it's great
to have her back.

223
00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:17.381
Marvelous.
absolutely bloody marvelous.

224
00:17:25.078 --> 00:17:26.424
<i>We all thought
she was dead.</i>

225
00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:29.496
<i>She kept her figure
all the same though. didn't she?</i>

226
00:17:29.496 --> 00:17:31.533
I didn't notice a ring. Did you?

227
00:17:31.843 --> 00:17:33.052
Who'd have her. Lily?

228
00:17:33.742 --> 00:17:35.330
She's sour milk. that one.

229
00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:37.159
I can't believe
you's are badmouthing her

230
00:17:37.159 --> 00:17:38.333
and her mother only dead.

231
00:17:38.781 --> 00:17:41.129
She never cared about
her mother. Dolly.

232
00:17:41.129 --> 00:17:44.546
Coming back 40 years later
when the poor woman's gone.

233
00:17:44.546 --> 00:17:45.892
She was a friend.

234
00:17:46.962 --> 00:17:51.725
Eileen. Eileen was everything
for Chrissie.

235
00:17:52.899 --> 00:17:54.176
Being an only child.

236
00:17:54.487 --> 00:17:57.628
Eileen looked out for her.
protected her.

237
00:17:58.629 --> 00:18:01.425
They were cousins
and best friends.

238
00:18:02.426 --> 00:18:04.324
You never mentioned this before.

239
00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:07.534
Eileen. Chrissie and my Declan.

240
00:18:07.534 --> 00:18:11.297
you couldn't put a couple
of cigarette paper between them.

241
00:18:11.607 --> 00:18:15.439
- But why did she go to America?
-  She had to leave.

242
00:18:16.371 --> 00:18:17.924
- What do you mean?
-  Dolly.

243
00:18:18.166 --> 00:18:21.652
some things are best
left unsaid. Now. leave it.

Dolly. Peter wants you
to have the tickets...

251
00:19:01.692 --> 00:19:04.315
- so Daniel can go to Lourdes.
- So. he can learn to talk.

252
00:19:06.386 --> 00:19:08.630
Thank you. Peter.

253
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:10.045
Oh. oh. My heart.

254
00:19:11.426 --> 00:19:14.325
- What a boy you are.

255
00:19:15.119 --> 00:19:17.121
That is so good of him.

256
00:19:17.708 --> 00:19:21.677
- Daniel.
- You're going to Lourdes.

257
00:19:22.437 --> 00:19:25.716
We're going to Lourdes.

258
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:29.996
- We're going with Lily.
It's wonderful.

259
00:20:16.905 --> 00:20:19.218
And I heard a loud voice
from the throne saying.

260
00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:22.669
"Look. God's dwelling place is
now amongst the people.

261
00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:23.877
and he will dwell with them.

262
00:20:24.568 --> 00:20:25.741
They will be his people

263
00:20:25.741 --> 00:20:28.088
and God himself will be
with them and be their God.

264
00:20:28.779 --> 00:20:30.712
He will wipe every tear
from their eyes.

265
00:20:32.507 --> 00:20:34.750
There will be no more death
or mourning

266
00:20:35.095 --> 00:20:36.545
or crying or pain...

267
00:20:39.824 --> 00:20:42.102
for the old order
of things has passed away."

268
00:21:04.504 --> 00:21:07.680
Is Mrs. Fox going to Lourdes
to grow her leg back?

269
00:21:08.439 --> 00:21:09.613
No. my love.

270
00:21:09.613 --> 00:21:11.270
Her leg is not going
to grow back.

271
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:12.961
She's going to help Dolly
and Daniel.

272
00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:23.178
Wonderful service. Father.

273
00:21:24.317 --> 00:21:27.803
It came to me all of a sudden.
Maureen's ticket to Lourdes.

274
00:21:28.114 --> 00:21:30.185
it's terrible for it
to go to waste.

275
00:21:32.808 --> 00:21:35.742
I have this lump on my breast.

276
00:21:36.122 --> 00:21:38.262
I see. And have you been
to the doctor with it?

277
00:21:38.262 --> 00:21:39.332
Oh. no.

278
00:21:39.712 --> 00:21:41.265
I want to go to Lourdes.

279
00:21:42.404 --> 00:21:44.303
Since poor Maureen is gone.

280
00:21:44.303 --> 00:21:46.719
she'd want her ticket put
to good use.

281
00:21:48.962 --> 00:21:50.516
I'll see what I can do.

282
00:21:51.482 --> 00:21:52.656
Bless you. Father.

283
00:21:58.662 --> 00:22:00.319
I'm sorry for your loss.

284
00:22:01.078 --> 00:22:05.116
Your Ma asked me to give you
this in case you came home.

285
00:22:17.577 --> 00:22:20.235
<i>"Dear Chrissie.
if you are reading this.</i>

286
00:22:20.235 --> 00:22:21.961
<i>it means you came
for my funeral.</i>

287
00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.135
<i>so thank you for that.</i>

288
00:22:25.551 --> 00:22:27.760
<i>I remember you
saying when you left</i>

289
00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.210
<i>that you'd only come
back when I was dead.</i>

290
00:22:31.211 --> 00:22:32.247
<i>Welcome home.</i>

291
00:22:33.628 --> 00:22:36.631
<i>I don't know the pain
and the joy that you've known.</i>

292
00:22:37.183 --> 00:22:38.978
<i>I guess I don't really know
you at all.</i>

293
00:22:39.427 --> 00:22:42.395
<i>not the you
that is reading this today.</i>

294
00:22:43.431 --> 00:22:46.675
<i>But you're here.
and that tells me everything.</i>

295
00:22:48.367 --> 00:22:50.438
<i>I've been saving
for a very long time</i>

296
00:22:50.438 --> 00:22:54.062
<i>to come and see you in America.
I always wanted to see Boston.</i>

297
00:22:57.065 --> 00:22:58.860
<i>We are more alike
than you think.</i>

298
00:22:59.378 --> 00:23:02.208
<i>We both carry our pain
too proudly.</i>

299
00:23:04.244 --> 00:23:06.937
<i>I know you have no love
for Lily Fox or Eileen.</i>

300
00:23:07.627 --> 00:23:11.562
<i>I don't blame you for that.
but it's a heavy load to carry.</i>

301
00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:16.671
<i>I've left something for you</i>

302
00:23:16.671 --> 00:23:18.880
<i>in the top drawer
of my dressing table.</i>

303
00:23:28.959 --> 00:23:33.412
<i>I'm sorry for what I said.
I'm sorry for what I did.</i>

304
00:23:45.078 --> 00:23:47.218
<i>The last words you hear
from a mother</i>

305
00:23:47.667 --> 00:23:49.393
<i>shouldn't be angry ones.</i>

306
00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:54.847
<i>I love you. Chrissie.
with all my heart.</i>

307
00:23:56.849 --> 00:23:57.953
<i>God bless."</i>

308
00:23:59.161 --> 00:24:01.612
- Hello. hello?

309
00:24:14.556 --> 00:24:15.695
How are you. Chrissie?

310
00:24:17.179 --> 00:24:18.491
My mother is dead.

311
00:24:18.491 --> 00:24:21.183
I'm in a place I swore
I would never come back to.

312
00:24:21.183 --> 00:24:23.669
everyone is happy
as ever to see me.

313
00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:28.501
so overall. I'd
say. yeah. mixed.

314
00:24:29.744 --> 00:24:31.366
You seem a little cross. maybe.

315
00:24:32.436 --> 00:24:33.437
You think?

316
00:24:45.587 --> 00:24:46.899
- From my mother.
- Thank you.

317
00:24:48.556 --> 00:24:51.490
Put it to good use.
Just do not give it to the nuns.

318
00:24:55.908 --> 00:24:57.530
This is your mother's voucher
for Lourdes.

319
00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.878
Give it to someone who needs it.
I don't need a cure.

320
00:25:01.258 --> 00:25:03.225
Not everyone goes to Lourdes
for a cure.

321
00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.401
No?

322
00:25:08.368 --> 00:25:09.853
What was she looking for. then?

323
00:25:12.131 --> 00:25:13.201
Reconciliation.

324
00:25:17.067 --> 00:25:18.931
I think she'd like you
to go in her place.

325
00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:23.245
Take the voucher.

326
00:25:25.213 --> 00:25:26.525
I don't need it.

327
00:25:55.899 --> 00:25:57.176
Chrissie wanted you to have it.

328
00:26:00.973 --> 00:26:02.630
You didn't tell her
about my lump. did you?

329
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:04.632
No. no. no. no. no.
Strictly between ourselves.

330
00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:08.774
Congratulations.
You're coming to Lourdes.

331
00:26:12.294 --> 00:26:13.744
It's a service of gratitude

332
00:26:13.744 --> 00:26:15.090
to God and Our Lady.

333
00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:17.230
Service of gratitude
to my bleeding arse.

334
00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:20.406
It's one big gimmick
to squeeze my money out of me.

335
00:26:20.406 --> 00:26:21.890
Do you not know
the "Song of Bernadette"?

336
00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:22.995
No.

337
00:26:22.995 --> 00:26:26.067
- How does it go again?
- It's not a song. it's a film.

338
00:26:26.308 --> 00:26:28.000
It's about St Bernadette

339
00:26:28.345 --> 00:26:30.312
and how she saw
the Blessed Virgin at Lourdes.

340
00:26:30.589 --> 00:26:32.418
You're not going
to no bleeding Lourdes.

341
00:26:32.418 --> 00:26:33.937
I have to go. Frank. please.

342
00:26:34.316 --> 00:26:35.663
You got something
all of a sudden?

343
00:26:36.008 --> 00:26:37.009
Course not.

344
00:26:40.529 --> 00:26:44.188
You're not going on any holiday
in the French Riviera

345
00:26:44.188 --> 00:26:48.503
with Father Too Good-looking
for his own bleeding good.

346
00:26:49.159 --> 00:26:50.781
You think I can't see
what's going on?

347
00:26:51.161 --> 00:26:54.578
I'll be helping Dolly and Daniel
and the other poor unfortunates.

348
00:26:54.578 --> 00:26:56.718
Unfortunate.
that's a good one.

349
00:26:56.718 --> 00:26:58.306
What about me?
I'm the unfortunate one.

350
00:26:58.306 --> 00:27:00.826
Who's going to have to do the
cooking and the cleaning

351
00:27:00.826 --> 00:27:02.172
and minding the children?

352
00:27:02.172 --> 00:27:04.346
Not me. I can tell you.
That's your job.

353
00:27:04.346 --> 00:27:05.416
Will you go
and sell that ticket?

354
00:27:05.865 --> 00:27:07.522
I'm not selling it.

355
00:27:07.522 --> 00:27:10.698
Sell it! Sell it
to some poor unfortunate.

356
00:27:54.673 --> 00:27:57.192
- Joe. how are you?
Good morning. Father.

357
00:27:57.192 --> 00:28:00.506
There's nobody here yet
but they'll be along anon.

358
00:28:01.093 --> 00:28:02.542
Right. I better go
in and get my bag.

359
00:28:02.957 --> 00:28:05.269
You can't go. I won't allow it.

360
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:07.893
- I'm going.
- What'll I do on me own?

361
00:28:08.479 --> 00:28:10.689
I'll be back before you know it.

362
00:28:12.035 --> 00:28:14.762
Now. will you stop
making me feel bad?

363
00:28:14.762 --> 00:28:17.937
- What if something happens?
- Go back to bed. Tommy.

364
00:28:17.937 --> 00:28:19.559
You'll be safe there.

365
00:28:24.668 --> 00:28:27.809
Oh. Jimmy. Jimmy.
will you tell Mr. Dunne

366
00:28:27.809 --> 00:28:31.192
we've got a leak.
Would he call over right away?

367
00:28:31.433 --> 00:28:33.056
- Yes. Mrs. Fox.
Good lad.

368
00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.507
I didn't see a leak.

369
00:28:36.749 --> 00:28:39.338
Well. it's all wet
in the bathroom.

370
00:28:40.097 --> 00:28:42.859
- Just a mo.

371
00:28:58.253 --> 00:29:00.117
I think it's the lav.

372
00:29:00.635 --> 00:29:02.602
I've got to hurry.
I've got to hurry.

373
00:29:04.432 --> 00:29:06.089
I'm going to Tom
and Lily's house.

374
00:29:07.469 --> 00:29:08.470
They have a leak.

375
00:29:09.644 --> 00:29:13.130
- Oh. I hope it's not too bad.

376
00:29:19.861 --> 00:29:22.174
Tommy?

377
00:29:23.451 --> 00:29:25.142
Don't burn
your father's sausages.

378
00:29:25.142 --> 00:29:26.143
whatever you do.

379
00:29:26.523 --> 00:29:28.767
And remember
Patrick's asthma medicine.

380
00:29:28.767 --> 00:29:32.667
And look. if you still want
to marry your sweetie pie

381
00:29:33.047 --> 00:29:35.497
after you've cooked and cleaned
and scrubbed for a week

382
00:29:35.877 --> 00:29:38.362
while he sits in the pub
and talks shite with the lads.

383
00:29:38.707 --> 00:29:41.055
who am I to stand
in the way of true love?

384
00:29:41.331 --> 00:29:43.505
- Do you mean that. Ma?

385
00:29:48.856 --> 00:29:50.167
Now. be good to them.

386
00:29:51.513 --> 00:29:53.205
- What are you doing?

387
00:29:53.205 --> 00:29:54.344
Kissing you goodbye.

388
00:29:55.794 --> 00:29:57.519
It's not like I'm going
down to the shops.

389
00:29:57.865 --> 00:29:59.970
I'm going abroad. To France.

390
00:30:01.834 --> 00:30:02.835
To France?

391
00:30:03.491 --> 00:30:05.286
I thought you were going
to Lourdes.

392
00:30:07.633 --> 00:30:10.947
- But you are coming back. Ma?
- Maybe. maybe not.

393
00:30:15.054 --> 00:30:17.194
Eileen.
you made it. Show me that bag.

394
00:30:18.092 --> 00:30:20.301
- I'll put it in the back.
-  Thank you. Father.

395
00:30:26.894 --> 00:30:29.620
- Hello. hello.
Come and sit down.

396
00:30:29.862 --> 00:30:32.313
- You are here.

397
00:30:38.802 --> 00:30:40.804
- Where's Dolly?
- I don't know.

398
00:30:40.804 --> 00:30:42.530
She should be here. surely.

399
00:30:50.538 --> 00:30:52.989
Sorry. son.
you're going nowhere.

400
00:30:56.682 --> 00:30:58.995
Jesus. Dolly. don't start.

401
00:31:02.032 --> 00:31:03.206
What's that?

402
00:31:04.552 --> 00:31:07.106
- We're going to Lourdes.
- You are. me bollocks.

403
00:31:07.106 --> 00:31:09.384
Ruth in Number 45

404
00:31:09.384 --> 00:31:11.870
said she'd mind Rosie
while you're at work.

405
00:31:12.525 --> 00:31:14.596
Dolly. Dolly!

406
00:31:15.943 --> 00:31:17.047
If you go out that door.

407
00:31:17.047 --> 00:31:18.497
don't bleeding bother
coming back.

408
00:31:23.536 --> 00:31:25.159
Oh. oh. no!

409
00:31:25.159 --> 00:31:27.471
Father. no. we can't go.
we can't go.

410
00:31:27.471 --> 00:31:30.889
- We can't. Dolly is not here.
- We can't wait any longer

411
00:31:30.889 --> 00:31:32.304
otherwise we won't make it
to the ferry.

412
00:31:32.891 --> 00:31:34.547
- Fire ahead there. Joe.
A catastrophe!

413
00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:36.791
On. no. I can't believe it.

414
00:31:37.965 --> 00:31:40.312
Wait. wait. wait!

415
00:31:40.622 --> 00:31:42.245
- Wait a minute.
- There they are.

416
00:31:42.245 --> 00:31:44.903
- Stop. stop!
- She has to sit here.

417
00:31:45.248 --> 00:31:47.077
- Thank God. they're here.
- Oh. my God.

418
00:31:47.802 --> 00:31:50.115
My dear girl.
where were you?

419
00:31:50.391 --> 00:31:52.082
The skin
of your teeth. Dolly.

420
00:31:52.082 --> 00:31:53.566
Oh. yeah. as yours.

421
00:31:53.566 --> 00:31:56.742
- Oh. come on in.
- Daniel. come along.

422
00:31:57.018 --> 00:31:58.054
Hello. Father.

423
00:32:02.644 --> 00:32:05.130
- There we go.
- Thank you.

424
00:32:05.509 --> 00:32:07.960
- Oh!
- You can go ahead now.

425
00:32:08.374 --> 00:32:09.928
Thank you.

426
00:32:28.118 --> 00:32:31.328
- Holy Mary. Mother of God.
- I don't shagging believe it.

427
00:32:40.199 --> 00:32:42.305
Welcome. Chrissie.
There's a place here

428
00:32:42.305 --> 00:32:44.376
if you don't mind
sitting alongside me.

429
00:32:47.275 --> 00:32:48.449
Excuse me.

430
00:33:04.775 --> 00:33:06.191
To Lourdes. driver.

431
00:34:19.609 --> 00:34:20.610
Hi.

432
00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:24.476
What's your name?

433
00:34:27.099 --> 00:34:28.307
- Daniel.
-  Wow.

434
00:34:29.722 --> 00:34:32.070
Hi. Daniel. I'm Chrissie.

435
00:34:35.038 --> 00:34:36.384
He doesn't talk yet.

436
00:34:38.490 --> 00:34:40.768
My Ma says he'll talk
when he's something to say.

437
00:34:42.597 --> 00:34:43.702
Isn't that right. Daniel?

438
00:34:47.361 --> 00:34:48.569
Very sensible.

439
00:35:00.995 --> 00:35:02.652
Look. Daniel.

440
00:35:03.687 --> 00:35:05.827
Daniel. look.
there's the Basilica.

441
00:35:58.501 --> 00:36:00.158
- Welcome to Lourdes.
- Oh.

442
00:36:00.848 --> 00:36:03.885
Oh. Father. I can't believe it.

443
00:36:03.885 --> 00:36:07.475
We're here. we're really here.

444
00:36:09.719 --> 00:36:11.030
- Ah!
<i>- Bonjour.</i>

445
00:36:11.341 --> 00:36:14.793
I've always wanted
a bellboy to carry my bags.

446
00:36:16.726 --> 00:36:20.557
Isn't it gorgeous?
Hotel de Bernadette.

447
00:36:31.396 --> 00:36:34.019
Chrissie. I have you
in room number eight.

448
00:36:34.019 --> 00:36:36.055
- Hm.
- See you later.

449
00:36:38.989 --> 00:36:40.198
You. number 14.

450
00:36:42.476 --> 00:36:43.546
Please. this way.

451
00:36:52.486 --> 00:36:53.625
Isn't this lovely?

452
00:36:56.144 --> 00:36:58.043
Don't you get talking
to that one at all. Dolly.

453
00:36:58.595 --> 00:37:00.079
Who? Chrissie?

454
00:37:00.563 --> 00:37:02.081
What the hell
is she doing here?

455
00:37:03.255 --> 00:37:04.912
I think she just wanted a break

456
00:37:04.912 --> 00:37:06.741
with her Ma passing
and all that.

457
00:37:06.741 --> 00:37:07.949
I'll tell you what she's up to.

458
00:37:08.847 --> 00:37:09.848
What?

459
00:37:10.124 --> 00:37:12.126
Father Dermot.
that's what she's after.

460
00:37:18.891 --> 00:37:20.617
It appears
I am sharing with you.

461
00:37:22.895 --> 00:37:27.072
And look. the Basilica.
Isn't it beautiful?

462
00:37:28.625 --> 00:37:29.799
Is there only one bed?

463
00:37:31.283 --> 00:37:32.974
Your Ma wouldn't have fussed.

464
00:37:32.974 --> 00:37:36.254
Well...
I am not my mother.

465
00:37:36.599 --> 00:37:38.048
Ain't that the truth.

466
00:37:39.498 --> 00:37:40.499
What does that mean?

467
00:37:43.226 --> 00:37:45.055
Show some respect. Chrissie.

468
00:37:45.918 --> 00:37:47.920
This is a holy place.

469
00:37:52.062 --> 00:37:53.616
Father's taking us
to the grotto.

470
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:55.583
and he's booked the baths
for tomorrow.

471
00:37:56.515 --> 00:37:57.758
See you downstairs. Lil.

472
00:37:58.448 --> 00:37:59.415
Right.

473
00:38:03.936 --> 00:38:05.524
Whatever the reason you came.

474
00:38:05.524 --> 00:38:07.595
it wasn't to sit
in a hotel room.

475
00:38:22.023 --> 00:38:23.922
I wasn't
expecting all this.

476
00:38:24.854 --> 00:38:26.476
All what?

477
00:38:26.476 --> 00:38:27.995
- Selling.
- Selling.

478
00:38:28.823 --> 00:38:29.824
Yeah.

479
00:38:30.894 --> 00:38:33.276
You'd think it was
Liberty Market back in Dublin.

480
00:38:33.828 --> 00:38:34.829
I suppose.

481
00:38:36.141 --> 00:38:38.005
I thought
our Lord hated all that

482
00:38:38.005 --> 00:38:39.386
when he chased them
out of the temple.

483
00:38:40.525 --> 00:38:41.871
Hard to believe though.
isn't it?

484
00:38:43.355 --> 00:38:46.979
Her coming after having Jesus
to coming here to Lourdes?

485
00:38:48.187 --> 00:38:49.568
And France. like.

486
00:38:49.568 --> 00:38:50.569
I mean...

487
00:38:51.225 --> 00:38:53.883
Why did she suddenly show up
after all these years?

488
00:38:58.128 --> 00:38:59.854
I'm asking myself
the same thing.

489
00:39:04.134 --> 00:39:05.308
What you got there. Daniel?

490
00:39:10.313 --> 00:39:11.349
Look!

491
00:39:14.352 --> 00:39:16.837
Ah. It's so pretty.

492
00:39:18.183 --> 00:39:20.979
I'll treat you. Daniel.
Not a word to Frank. you hear?

493
00:39:23.361 --> 00:39:25.880
And I'll have 12 of them
miraculous medals.

494
00:39:26.812 --> 00:39:28.780
Let's go and have
a look at those rosary beads.

495
00:39:29.401 --> 00:39:30.782
We could get one for Grandma.

496
00:39:55.358 --> 00:39:56.808
Mother of God!

497
00:39:59.949 --> 00:40:01.571
I can't believe it.

498
00:40:02.745 --> 00:40:05.782
Our Blessed Lady in Heaven.

499
00:40:06.093 --> 00:40:07.405
There's where
she appeared.

500
00:40:08.406 --> 00:40:10.925
right there on that spot.

501
00:40:10.925 --> 00:40:13.307
When you think of all
she went through...

502
00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:16.552
watching her poor son...

503
00:40:17.898 --> 00:40:19.209
crucified.

504
00:40:20.521 --> 00:40:23.317
She's picked a good place
to stand. all the same.

505
00:40:24.145 --> 00:40:27.148
- What?
- So. we could all see her.

506
00:40:28.149 --> 00:40:29.288
Oh.

507
00:40:34.017 --> 00:40:35.847
Do you believe
she really came here?

508
00:40:37.538 --> 00:40:41.162
The Virgin Mary picked this spot
and that girl?

509
00:40:42.819 --> 00:40:44.925
Yes. yes. I do.

510
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:49.999
Whether she did
or not. is unimportant.

511
00:40:51.449 --> 00:40:53.278
You might want to keep that
to yourself.

512
00:41:04.807 --> 00:41:06.671
Wonder what that
one came here for.

513
00:41:07.879 --> 00:41:09.812
Well. maybe
our Lady brought her.

514
00:41:10.191 --> 00:41:13.816
I think she's nice.
So is her clothes.

515
00:41:33.042 --> 00:41:35.044
Would you stop staring?

516
00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:38.530
People hate to be stared at.

517
00:41:43.052 --> 00:41:45.710
Look. isn't it beautiful?

518
00:41:46.607 --> 00:41:49.610
See. that's where
all the crutches used to hang

519
00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:51.405
from all the miracles.

520
00:41:53.718 --> 00:41:56.203
We'll find a miracle
for you. Daniel.

521
00:41:56.514 --> 00:41:58.205
Daniel. Lily's talking to you.

522
00:41:58.792 --> 00:42:00.414
It's all right. love.
never mind.

523
00:42:00.932 --> 00:42:02.485
God. imagine though.

524
00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:03.866
What?

525
00:42:04.556 --> 00:42:08.008
If we seen one happening
right in front of our eyes.

526
00:42:08.595 --> 00:42:09.975
a miracle like.

527
00:42:10.355 --> 00:42:12.322
I think I'd die
if I seen people get up.

528
00:42:12.702 --> 00:42:14.773
throw their crutches away
and walk.

529
00:42:14.773 --> 00:42:16.568
But it might not
be crutches. Eileen.

530
00:42:18.363 --> 00:42:20.054
Other things get cured. too.

531
00:42:20.952 --> 00:42:22.712
Tumors and things
you can't see.

532
00:42:24.749 --> 00:42:25.784
Now. that's right.

533
00:42:26.751 --> 00:42:29.270
How do we know there wasn't
hundreds of them cures?

534
00:42:30.237 --> 00:42:31.859
Sure. look at Lily over there.

535
00:42:33.516 --> 00:42:35.518
What about Lily over there?

536
00:42:35.967 --> 00:42:37.865
Well. you don't need a crutch.

537
00:42:38.797 --> 00:42:40.005
Excuse me?

538
00:42:40.696 --> 00:42:43.630
For your leg.
You don't need a crutch to walk.

539
00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:45.183
so if you got a cure now

540
00:42:46.011 --> 00:42:48.117
you wouldn't have a crutch
to put up on the wall.

541
00:42:48.117 --> 00:42:52.949
I didn't come here looking
for my leg to grow longer.

542
00:42:52.949 --> 00:42:54.261
for God's sake.

543
00:42:54.261 --> 00:42:56.021
I wouldn't know
what to do with myself.

544
00:42:56.435 --> 00:42:59.611
In fact. I'd probably lose
my balance.

545
00:43:04.236 --> 00:43:06.307
Jesus!

546
00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:21.944
How in the name of Jesus
am I supposed to do this?

547
00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:24.325
Do what your wife
does every day.

548
00:43:24.671 --> 00:43:28.226
- What's that?
- Give us your hand.

549
00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:34.508
Oh. Hmm.

550
00:43:34.888 --> 00:43:36.959
Did your poor wife
pass away on you?

551
00:43:36.959 --> 00:43:38.167
What? Jesus. no.

552
00:43:39.306 --> 00:43:41.170
- She's in Lourdes.
- Lourdes?

553
00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:44.794
Well. there's a miracle
for her now.

554
00:43:45.692 --> 00:43:47.279
You. shopping.

555
00:43:48.591 --> 00:43:51.318
Best of luck to you.

556
00:43:54.804 --> 00:43:56.841
Oh.
- Jesus. poor Ma.

557
00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:59.222
Don't know why
she hasn't left you already.

558
00:43:59.222 --> 00:44:01.949
On. sorry. I forgot.
She has left you.

559
00:44:01.949 --> 00:44:02.985
What?

560
00:44:04.158 --> 00:44:05.159
Kathy...

561
00:44:06.885 --> 00:44:08.231
Is she not coming back?

562
00:44:08.231 --> 00:44:10.820
Well. ask yourself. Da.
why would she?

563
00:44:13.823 --> 00:44:15.135
- Rosie. hold still.

564
00:44:18.448 --> 00:44:20.278
- Rosie. Rosie.

565
00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:23.488
-  Stop it.

566
00:44:24.454 --> 00:44:25.663
- Come on. Rosie.
Mama.

567
00:44:26.353 --> 00:44:27.526
No. Mama's not here.

568
00:44:27.526 --> 00:44:29.321
- There you go.

569
00:44:31.565 --> 00:44:33.291
I think we have it.

570
00:44:34.499 --> 00:44:38.158
- Yeah.

571
00:44:38.537 --> 00:44:39.642
Yeah.

572
00:44:56.694 --> 00:45:00.939
<i>♪ Blue shoes. blue nails</i>

573
00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:05.219
<i>♪ A blue dress
That never fails ♪</i>

574
00:45:05.219 --> 00:45:08.533
<i>♪ There's no color
In the rainbow ♪</i>

575
00:45:08.533 --> 00:45:10.742
<i>♪ That my girl can't be</i>

576
00:45:10.742 --> 00:45:15.022
Mm.  Mm.

577
00:45:42.429 --> 00:45:43.810
"She'll ruin your life."

578
00:45:45.604 --> 00:45:46.605
What?

579
00:45:48.711 --> 00:45:50.230
Isn't that
what you said to Declan?

580
00:45:52.404 --> 00:45:55.407
-"She'll ruin your life"?
- Not now. Chrissie.

581
00:45:57.824 --> 00:45:59.549
I was 17.

582
00:46:01.172 --> 00:46:04.313
I was pregnant.
We were so happy.

583
00:46:04.692 --> 00:46:07.626
We were so-- How was I going
to ruin his life?

584
00:46:07.626 --> 00:46:09.836
I thought you were
trying to trap him.

585
00:46:11.044 --> 00:46:13.978
He was my son. my only son.

586
00:46:18.223 --> 00:46:20.778
I wanted him to have
a better life than I had.

587
00:46:22.124 --> 00:46:23.090
We would have.

588
00:46:27.785 --> 00:46:28.924
How did you manage it?

589
00:46:30.684 --> 00:46:32.479
How did you convince her
to shut me out?

590
00:46:35.827 --> 00:46:37.691
Your mother did her best.

591
00:46:38.381 --> 00:46:42.558
but with your father dead
there was no-one to reel you in.

592
00:46:42.558 --> 00:46:45.354
There was no talking to you.
You were wild.

593
00:46:46.907 --> 00:46:48.219
Your mother forgave me.

594
00:46:49.151 --> 00:46:52.602
God punished me. didn't he?
Taking my boy like that.

595
00:46:53.983 --> 00:46:55.295
He punished all of us.

596
00:47:34.575 --> 00:47:38.510
No tea. no eggs. no sausages.

597
00:47:38.752 --> 00:47:40.512
It's no breakfast at all.

598
00:47:41.444 --> 00:47:43.274
Must be what
it's like in a convent.

599
00:48:03.259 --> 00:48:04.882
Here. I'm gonna take
this up to Daniel.

600
00:48:06.884 --> 00:48:08.299
Blackberry.

601
00:48:09.438 --> 00:48:10.611
Not like there is at home.

602
00:48:12.406 --> 00:48:13.407
Want to taste?

603
00:48:18.792 --> 00:48:20.276
We used to pick blackberries.

604
00:48:21.691 --> 00:48:22.727
You and me. and Declan.

605
00:48:24.315 --> 00:48:27.007
We'd lie on the grass.
and we'd eat them.

606
00:48:27.318 --> 00:48:28.975
and we'd brag
about our future. and...

607
00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:32.461
...oh. God.
We were so full of ourselves.

608
00:48:34.601 --> 00:48:35.602
Declan and you...

609
00:48:38.777 --> 00:48:40.538
- and me.

610
00:48:43.506 --> 00:48:45.301
I never heard
you come in last night.

611
00:48:45.301 --> 00:48:46.268
You must have been late.

612
00:48:47.579 --> 00:48:49.064
Well. I'm glad
I didn't wake you.

613
00:48:50.651 --> 00:48:51.929
Talking to Father Dermot?

614
00:48:54.207 --> 00:48:55.587
A priest.

615
00:48:56.934 --> 00:48:58.314
You always did
love a challenge.

616
00:49:04.182 --> 00:49:05.459
Declan could swim like a fish.

617
00:49:07.772 --> 00:49:10.568
Makes you wonder how he.
of all people...

618
00:49:12.328 --> 00:49:13.467
- would drown.

619
00:49:29.345 --> 00:49:30.312
Where's Lily?

620
00:49:31.002 --> 00:49:32.590
Her leg was hurting
this morning.

621
00:49:44.498 --> 00:49:46.535
Are you coming
to the baths?

622
00:49:46.535 --> 00:49:48.502
-  No.
- You okay?

623
00:49:49.434 --> 00:49:51.747
It's just me leg. You go ahead.

624
00:49:51.747 --> 00:49:53.818
I'll catch up
with you's all later.

625
00:49:54.888 --> 00:49:55.993
So. it's...

626
00:50:00.963 --> 00:50:03.897
- You look pale.
- I must have overdone it.

627
00:50:09.385 --> 00:50:11.663
You seem to know
what you're doing.

628
00:50:16.737 --> 00:50:19.706
Chrissie. Chrissie. the baby.
What happened?

629
00:50:35.446 --> 00:50:36.516
Your pulse is normal.

630
00:50:41.762 --> 00:50:43.661
I think we need to get you
a wheelchair.

631
00:50:46.905 --> 00:50:49.874
Now. you need to take it
easy on that leg today.

632
00:50:51.427 --> 00:50:52.463
I'll go fetch a chair.

633
00:50:55.362 --> 00:50:56.363
Yeah.

634
00:51:25.772 --> 00:51:29.327
Now. is everyone set?
Everyone ready?

635
00:51:29.741 --> 00:51:33.159
Well. here we go.
This is what we came for.

636
00:51:35.816 --> 00:51:40.166
Now. be strong.
Whatever you might see.

637
00:51:40.959 --> 00:51:44.170
the heartbreak of the world
is upon us.

638
00:51:52.695 --> 00:51:55.733
- Is that someone dying?
- It's the water.

639
00:51:56.561 --> 00:51:58.770
- They say it's bitter cold.

640
00:51:58.770 --> 00:51:59.771
Jesus.

641
00:52:00.634 --> 00:52:02.464
They're not stepping
in the same water as us.

642
00:52:02.464 --> 00:52:04.362
- are they?
- Oh. of course. they are.

643
00:52:04.673 --> 00:52:05.984
But that's a bit much.

644
00:52:07.089 --> 00:52:08.711
We'll be catching infections.

645
00:52:08.711 --> 00:52:10.403
Oh. no.
you won't catch a thing.

646
00:52:10.403 --> 00:52:12.991
This is Lourdes.
It's another miracle.

647
00:52:12.991 --> 00:52:15.994
Our Lady told everyone
to come and bathe...

648
00:52:15.994 --> 00:52:18.687
- ...in the miraculous water.

649
00:52:20.516 --> 00:52:21.828
- That's the man!

650
00:52:21.828 --> 00:52:23.554
It's a miracle.
He's after walking.

651
00:52:23.554 --> 00:52:24.727
It is a miracle.

652
00:52:24.727 --> 00:52:26.695
- Get him in. get him in quick.

653
00:52:27.005 --> 00:52:29.422
- Her Lady is here.
Oh. come on Daniel.

654
00:52:29.422 --> 00:52:33.150
We're only here five minutes
and there's one already.

655
00:52:33.633 --> 00:52:34.634
Get Daniel in.

656
00:52:35.290 --> 00:52:38.085
- I touched him. I touched him.

657
00:52:38.085 --> 00:52:39.708
Get him
in the same bath.

658
00:53:04.836 --> 00:53:06.700
<i>Tres bien.</i> come on down.

659
00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:12.741
Come on.

660
00:53:14.915 --> 00:53:15.916
Come down.

661
00:53:32.278 --> 00:53:34.590
Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!

662
00:53:37.628 --> 00:53:38.629
It's nice.

663
00:53:40.665 --> 00:53:42.357
Come on. Daniel. please.

664
00:53:45.429 --> 00:53:47.638
I'm serious now. come on.

665
00:53:50.468 --> 00:53:52.470
Jesus!

666
00:53:59.443 --> 00:54:02.066
Jes--

667
00:54:03.964 --> 00:54:05.207
- Daniel.
Jesus!

668
00:54:10.419 --> 00:54:11.386
We're ready.

669
00:54:12.214 --> 00:54:13.250
I'm not.

670
00:54:16.839 --> 00:54:18.669
I believe you had
a miracle today.

671
00:54:19.256 --> 00:54:21.050
The poor crippled man
who ran out.

672
00:54:21.637 --> 00:54:24.744
Ah. no. false alarm.
Every day we have one.

673
00:54:25.779 --> 00:54:27.747
- Really?
- Every day.

674
00:54:28.644 --> 00:54:30.991
But only the men.
Always the men.

675
00:54:31.958 --> 00:54:33.131
You know what men are like.

676
00:54:35.099 --> 00:54:38.275
But the real miracles like.
how many a day would you get?

677
00:54:57.328 --> 00:54:58.536
You're all right. Daniel?

678
00:55:14.414 --> 00:55:15.450
Daniel!

679
00:55:16.416 --> 00:55:18.176
Daniel. did you say something?

680
00:55:18.176 --> 00:55:20.075
Say it again. Come on. come on.

681
00:55:20.075 --> 00:55:21.870
Dolly...
- You can do it. I'm listening.

682
00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:23.527
- ...just give him a minute.
- Say. Ma.

683
00:55:23.527 --> 00:55:26.323
- Ma. Ma. Ma. Ma. Ma. Ma.
- Dolly.

684
00:55:27.427 --> 00:55:28.877
We should try again. maybe.

685
00:55:29.291 --> 00:55:30.948
Oh. he only touched the water.

686
00:55:30.948 --> 00:55:32.846
If we could get him
all the way in.

687
00:55:32.846 --> 00:55:34.469
Dolly. just...
just look at him.

688
00:55:36.367 --> 00:55:37.989
Let him tell you
what he's trying to say.

689
00:55:42.339 --> 00:55:44.030
I'm so sorry. my love.

690
00:55:45.549 --> 00:55:46.653
So. sorry.

691
00:55:50.692 --> 00:55:53.453
- I'm a terrible mother.
- Oh.

692
00:55:53.453 --> 00:55:55.559
Stop it.
Dolly. it's just not true.

693
00:56:14.888 --> 00:56:16.925
- Well. that's that then.
- What?

694
00:56:18.547 --> 00:56:20.894
Guess how many miracles
there is after being.

695
00:56:20.894 --> 00:56:22.896
- How many? What?
- Sixty-two.

696
00:56:23.966 --> 00:56:27.763
- Sixty-two.
- That's very good in one day.

697
00:56:28.177 --> 00:56:29.178
Not in a day.

698
00:56:30.283 --> 00:56:32.458
Well. in a week.
that's still very good.

699
00:56:32.458 --> 00:56:33.424
Not in a week...

700
00:56:34.183 --> 00:56:38.360
since she first appeared
in 1858.

701
00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:41.915
1858?

702
00:56:43.434 --> 00:56:44.435
Oh. it couldn't be.

703
00:56:45.091 --> 00:56:48.128
I have to tell you.
I'm very disappointed. Lily.

704
00:56:49.371 --> 00:56:52.132
Frank was right.
It's all a bloody gimmick.

705
00:57:07.285 --> 00:57:08.839
Oh. that looks lovely.

706
00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:11.289
Lovely bit of stew.

707
00:57:12.118 --> 00:57:13.740
There you go. Now. uh...

708
00:57:15.155 --> 00:57:16.502
want a bit more?

709
00:57:17.399 --> 00:57:19.228
No. it's really good for you.
you know.

710
00:57:20.678 --> 00:57:22.680
Oh. boy. Uh. eat.

711
00:57:26.097 --> 00:57:27.167
I said eat.

712
00:57:30.447 --> 00:57:31.448
Mm-hmm.

713
00:57:34.554 --> 00:57:35.521
Well?

714
00:57:37.626 --> 00:57:39.076
- It's good.
- Mm-hm.

715
00:57:39.732 --> 00:57:41.803
It's hardly burnt at all.

716
00:57:44.012 --> 00:57:47.705
Excuse me. you always expect
a certain amount of burn

717
00:57:48.016 --> 00:57:49.189
with the stew.

718
00:57:49.189 --> 00:57:51.951
- Ugh. I can't eat it.

719
00:57:52.641 --> 00:57:54.988
- That was a bit curt.

720
00:57:54.988 --> 00:57:56.127
A little abrupt.

721
00:57:58.233 --> 00:57:59.717
Come on. eat up.

722
00:57:59.717 --> 00:58:01.961
I didn't know
you had it in you. Da.

723
00:58:01.961 --> 00:58:03.203
- Hm.
I... I don't.

724
00:58:03.203 --> 00:58:04.998
I... I made it up
as I went along.

725
00:58:06.137 --> 00:58:07.345
It's not as good as Ma's. anyway.

726
00:58:08.657 --> 00:58:10.866
Well. nothing is as good
as Ma's. you know.

727
00:58:41.379 --> 00:58:45.556

all of a sudden.

732
00:59:01.089 --> 00:59:03.747
I don't give a shite anymore.

733
00:59:05.956 --> 00:59:07.785
Raising six children is.

734
00:59:08.199 --> 00:59:10.443
obviously. not good enough
for some people.

735
00:59:11.824 --> 00:59:14.516
And a nursemaid

736
00:59:15.172 --> 00:59:16.173
Twelve.

737
00:59:16.898 --> 00:59:18.002

00:59:45.167 --> 00:59:46.824
- Excellent.
- Thank you. Chrissie.

746
00:59:47.411 --> 00:59:49.309
Goodnight. Daniel.

747
00:59:49.309 --> 00:59:52.761
That was good. Daniel.
Now. off you go to bed.

748
00:59:53.106 --> 00:59:54.142
God bless. hey.

749
00:59:55.212 --> 00:59:56.420
Goodnight. Lily.

750
00:59:56.972 --> 00:59:58.802
Anyone else
have a song for us now?

751
00:59:58.802 --> 01:00:02.150
- Oh. Eileen. give us a song.
- Right. you are.

752
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:04.773
so I don't have to listen
to Chrissie Aherne anymore.

753
01:00:07.189 --> 01:00:10.710

<i>♪ Are you the woman

761
01:00:54.374 --> 01:00:56.169
You can't sing that song here.

762
01:00:57.481 --> 01:00:59.034
Do you not like it. Father?

763
01:01:01.588 --> 01:01:04.039
Were you never a child?
We used to skip to it.

764
01:01:04.557 --> 01:01:06.179
You're in Lourdes now. Eileen.

765
01:01:07.318 --> 01:01:09.666
Don't you dare
lecture me. laddie.

766
01:01:10.943 --> 01:01:13.048
Dragging people halfway
around the world.

767
01:01:14.015 --> 01:01:17.225
only to disappoint them
when there is no miracles.

768
01:01:18.398 --> 01:01:22.230
It's a con. It's a sham.
You're a conman.

769
01:01:23.369 --> 01:01:26.406
Come on. its bedtime. Eileen.
Come on.

770
01:01:26.855 --> 01:01:28.857
Palling around
with Chrissie Aherne.

771
01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:32.585
If you ladies forgive me.
I'll... I'll... I'll...

772
01:01:32.585 --> 01:01:34.518
I can't believe you's. Eileen.

773
01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:38.418
carrying on like a corner boy
in Lourdes.

774
01:01:38.418 --> 01:01:41.111
I'm sorry. Sorry. Lily.

775
01:01:42.768 --> 01:01:46.047
-  Lily. I'm sorry.
- Oh. it's all right.

776
01:01:46.047 --> 01:01:47.220
It's all right.

777
01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:50.120
- Come on. we'll go to bed.
-  I am sorry. Lily.

778
01:01:50.534 --> 01:01:52.674
I just want to go home
and be with my kids.

779
01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:54.711
Come on. now.

780
01:01:55.884 --> 01:01:57.334
Apologies. Father.

781
01:01:58.438 --> 01:02:01.062
Why did you leave
and never come back?

782
01:02:01.062 --> 01:02:02.063
Leave?

783
01:02:04.134 --> 01:02:05.618
I was banished. Eileen.

784
01:02:07.137 --> 01:02:09.139
You were there. You remember.

785
01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:12.107
And who told them
about the pregnancy?

786
01:02:14.385 --> 01:02:15.870
You were my best friend.

787
01:02:17.250 --> 01:02:18.700
You were the only one I told.

788
01:02:19.666 --> 01:02:23.394
Why didn't you give the baby
to the nuns as you was told?

789
01:02:24.154 --> 01:02:28.572
- Come on. Eileen. Come on.
Don't start with me...

790
01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:33.232
Pretending all these years
it was an accident.

791
01:02:34.854 --> 01:02:37.408
It was the guilt
that killed Declan.

792
01:02:39.790 --> 01:02:42.551
You killed him with the guilt.

793
01:02:53.735 --> 01:02:56.255
Apologies. Father.
- It's okay.

794
01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:02.779
Poor woman.

795
01:03:04.677 --> 01:03:07.024
Her condition at present though.
it's hardly surprising.

796
01:03:54.002 --> 01:03:55.832
I just can't live
with what I've done.

797
01:03:57.488 --> 01:03:58.489
Dolly.

798
01:04:00.871 --> 01:04:02.321
- Dolly. just breathe.

799
01:04:03.598 --> 01:04:06.083
- Here. Come. come sit.

800
01:04:19.407 --> 01:04:20.857
I have to make a confession.

801
01:04:21.512 --> 01:04:22.893
I'll get Father Dermot.

802
01:04:22.893 --> 01:04:25.378
Oh. I don't think
he'll come after all that.

803
01:04:26.759 --> 01:04:28.347
Well. I have to confess me sin.

804
01:04:30.521 --> 01:04:31.729
What sin. Dolly?

805
01:04:32.523 --> 01:04:34.042
I ruined him.

806
01:04:35.733 --> 01:04:36.734
What did you do?

807
01:04:37.839 --> 01:04:40.566
Did you smack him. Dolly?
We all do that.

808
01:04:41.532 --> 01:04:43.086
- You get overwhelmed.

809
01:04:43.949 --> 01:04:44.915
No.

810
01:04:45.571 --> 01:04:47.021
The trauma in the womb...

811
01:04:48.677 --> 01:04:49.678
what I done on him.

812
01:04:50.956 --> 01:04:51.922
What did you do?

813
01:04:54.062 --> 01:04:55.615
I tried to miscarry him.

814
01:04:58.998 --> 01:05:01.587
Oh. that's old wives' tales.
Dolly.

815
01:05:02.381 --> 01:05:03.761
None of them work.

816
01:05:04.555 --> 01:05:07.489
Between ourselves.
I threw myself down the stairs

817
01:05:07.489 --> 01:05:09.422
more times
than I had hot dinners.

818
01:05:11.873 --> 01:05:13.806
Thank God.
they came out the same way.

819
01:05:15.946 --> 01:05:17.568
What one did you do. Dolly?

820
01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:22.815
I can't.

821
01:05:22.815 --> 01:05:25.887
Oh. it's best
you get it off your chest.

822
01:05:25.887 --> 01:05:29.718
You'll see yourself.
it's probably nothing.

823
01:05:30.650 --> 01:05:33.584
Now. how... how...
how did you try?

824
01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:36.484
- Just leave her alone.

825
01:05:37.347 --> 01:05:39.487
- She doesn't wanna say.
- But I want to tell.

826
01:05:39.487 --> 01:05:42.766
- I have to confess.
- No. No. you don't have to.

827
01:05:42.766 --> 01:05:45.251
Guilt is killing her.
isn't it. Dolly?

828
01:05:46.666 --> 01:05:47.667
See?

829
01:05:48.841 --> 01:05:50.015
Go on. Dolly. love.

830
01:05:51.395 --> 01:05:55.434
- I filled the bath with water.
- Dolly. don't tell them.

831
01:05:56.987 --> 01:05:58.126
You can tell us. Dolly.

832
01:05:59.507 --> 01:06:03.028
You filled the bath up
and then what happened?

833
01:06:04.719 --> 01:06:07.584
It was freezing.
just like today...

834
01:06:10.794 --> 01:06:12.382
and then I got the whisky.

835
01:06:13.797 --> 01:06:14.798
Whisky?

836
01:06:16.662 --> 01:06:17.766
Five bottles.

837
01:06:19.837 --> 01:06:21.529
Five bottles?

838
01:06:22.426 --> 01:06:24.877
You could have killed yourself
drinking five bottles of whisky.

839
01:06:24.877 --> 01:06:26.016
I didn't drink them.

840
01:06:27.535 --> 01:06:29.157
What did you do with them then?

841
01:06:30.503 --> 01:06:31.849
I poured them in the bath.

842
01:06:35.198 --> 01:06:36.958
- What did you do that for?

843
01:06:37.407 --> 01:06:40.479
You know why.
I sat in it to make it pass.

844
01:06:41.273 --> 01:06:44.276
That's how I know
I done it to him.

845
01:06:44.276 --> 01:06:47.313
You didn't do anything. Dolly.

846
01:06:49.867 --> 01:06:51.628
Sure. I mean...

847
01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:54.907
he's perfect. Daniel.

848
01:06:57.668 --> 01:06:59.049
You didn't do anything. Dolly.

849
01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:03.536
It has to be boiling water.

850
01:07:03.536 --> 01:07:05.400
How do you know.
Chrissie?

851
01:07:06.298 --> 01:07:08.438
Because when I made it
to Boston...

852
01:07:09.887 --> 01:07:11.027
my landlady...

853
01:07:14.064 --> 01:07:15.031
she knew.

854
01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:18.862
She knew I was sick every day.

855
01:07:20.795 --> 01:07:23.073
I think she was used
to girls like me.

856
01:07:24.074 --> 01:07:25.524
She told me I couldn't stay...

857
01:07:26.594 --> 01:07:28.837
and she gave me
a name and an address.

858
01:07:32.048 --> 01:07:34.360
So. I went
just a few blocks away...

859
01:07:36.949 --> 01:07:38.847
and this woman...

860
01:07:40.435 --> 01:07:41.540
she gave me pills.

861
01:07:42.265 --> 01:07:44.060
She gave me something to drink.

862
01:07:49.962 --> 01:07:52.275
She did
what she had to do

863
01:07:53.414 --> 01:07:54.415
and then...

864
01:07:55.726 --> 01:07:56.969
she put me in a bathtub.

865
01:08:00.662 --> 01:08:02.147
The water has to be boiling.

866
01:08:13.192 --> 01:08:14.159
Oh.

867
01:08:16.333 --> 01:08:17.610
Chrissie.

868
01:08:22.788 --> 01:08:24.755
Oh. thank you.

869
01:09:01.413 --> 01:09:02.379
Chrissie?

870
01:09:04.209 --> 01:09:05.313
Hmm?

871
01:09:07.039 --> 01:09:10.180
Would you take me
to the baths in the morning?

872
01:09:12.976 --> 01:09:13.977
Would you?

873
01:09:43.386 --> 01:09:46.872
Eileen was only doing
what she thought

874
01:09:46.872 --> 01:09:51.601
was best for you.
same as your Ma and me.

875
01:09:52.912 --> 01:09:53.913
Declan...

876
01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:57.158
told us you were...

877
01:09:57.158 --> 01:09:58.332
...you were leaving.

878
01:10:00.092 --> 01:10:01.093
He...

879
01:10:01.852 --> 01:10:03.337
God. he loved you. Chrissie.

880
01:10:05.235 --> 01:10:06.616
He wanted to marry you...

881
01:10:07.755 --> 01:10:09.274
have the baby with you.

882
01:10:13.726 --> 01:10:15.211
I should never have meddled.

883
01:10:19.076 --> 01:10:20.561
It's because...
it's because of me...

884
01:10:21.734 --> 01:10:23.736
- he's dead.
- Oh. Lily.

885
01:10:23.736 --> 01:10:26.291
-  Oh. no.

886
01:10:26.291 --> 01:10:27.637
We lied to him.

887
01:10:29.501 --> 01:10:31.123
Yeah. we were ashamed.

888
01:10:32.642 --> 01:10:33.643
We lied.

889
01:10:35.127 --> 01:10:36.370
I lied.

890
01:10:38.268 --> 01:10:39.235
I told him...

891
01:10:40.650 --> 01:10:44.654
you were going to America
to find a better life...

892
01:10:46.621 --> 01:10:48.209
and that you'd done with him.

893
01:10:52.144 --> 01:10:54.664
And it destroyed him.

894
01:10:57.114 --> 01:11:00.117
I destroyed him
as sure as I gave him life.

895
01:11:05.053 --> 01:11:07.918
Now. I'm old. Chrissie.

896
01:11:08.954 --> 01:11:09.955
I'll be dying...

897
01:11:11.059 --> 01:11:12.129
soon enough.

898
01:11:13.165 --> 01:11:14.649
If it's a cold as...

899
01:11:16.513 --> 01:11:19.896
...Eileen says it is.
it'll be very s... soon.

900
01:11:20.483 --> 01:11:23.934
But I... I couldn't go...

901
01:11:23.934 --> 01:11:25.936
We're ready for you now.
my darling.

902
01:11:25.936 --> 01:11:28.939
...without trying
to tell you what...

903
01:11:50.823 --> 01:11:51.962
- Oh.

904
01:13:21.362 --> 01:13:22.363
Thank you.

905
01:13:23.364 --> 01:13:24.952
Oh.

906
01:13:26.367 --> 01:13:27.437
Oh. Jesus.

907
01:13:28.818 --> 01:13:32.062
I was hoping
she might come to me.

908
01:13:33.201 --> 01:13:36.273
- Who? The Virgin Mary?
No.

909
01:13:36.998 --> 01:13:39.449
No. your mother. Maureen.

910
01:13:40.761 --> 01:13:41.969
I was hoping she might...

911
01:13:43.073 --> 01:13:45.213
tell me what to expect.
you know. when I...

912
01:13:45.835 --> 01:13:47.319
when I got up there.

913
01:13:48.458 --> 01:13:52.255
If I get there.
I don't suppose I deserve that.

914
01:13:52.842 --> 01:13:53.843
I mean. I...

915
01:13:55.603 --> 01:13:57.605
I haven't believed. you know?

916
01:13:58.503 --> 01:14:03.024
Not properly. not since.
Declan. you know?

917
01:14:03.024 --> 01:14:06.027
But I... I...
I didn't have the heart

918
01:14:06.027 --> 01:14:07.684
to say that to your mother.

919
01:14:09.410 --> 01:14:10.411
No.

920
01:14:11.101 --> 01:14:12.102
Well...

921
01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:15.243
you wouldn't have wanted
to take that away from her.

922
01:14:16.866 --> 01:14:17.832
She loved it.

923
01:14:19.006 --> 01:14:20.421
All the hocus pocus.

924
01:14:22.423 --> 01:14:24.908
Well. there's always hope.
isn't there?

925
01:14:25.219 --> 01:14:28.602
Um. even... even when you don't
completely believe.

926
01:14:31.259 --> 01:14:32.260
Peace...

927
01:14:34.297 --> 01:14:35.367
that's what I hope for.

928
01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:38.474
Peace.

929
01:14:42.581 --> 01:14:44.894
I'm glad you came home. Chrissie.

930
01:14:46.067 --> 01:14:49.036
Your mother would
have been so proud.

931
01:14:51.314 --> 01:14:54.731
I've... I've no right
to ask you this. but...

932
01:14:55.905 --> 01:14:57.562
can you ever forgive me?

933
01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:09.366
Thank you.

934
01:15:12.162 --> 01:15:14.302
Thank you. Chrissie.

935
01:15:25.866 --> 01:15:27.764
I'm sorry about last night. Father.

936
01:15:29.386 --> 01:15:30.526
I don't take it back.

937
01:15:31.734 --> 01:15:33.701
You're. uh.
what do you call it...

938
01:15:34.909 --> 01:15:36.359
I gather the baths didn't help.

939
01:15:38.879 --> 01:15:40.743
You don't come to Lourdes
for a miracle. Eileen.

940
01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:42.745
You come for the strength

941
01:15:42.745 --> 01:15:43.918
to go on
when there is no miracle.

942
01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:50.511
Hmm.

943
01:16:26.616 --> 01:16:27.583
I loved you.

944
01:16:31.034 --> 01:16:32.898
I loved you and you left.

945
01:16:38.007 --> 01:16:39.008
So. I hated you.

946
01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:44.461
I didn't mean to...

947
01:16:46.429 --> 01:16:47.430
but I did.

948
01:16:52.159 --> 01:16:53.609
But I never hated you...

949
01:16:55.576 --> 01:16:56.784
more than I loved you.

950
01:17:03.066 --> 01:17:06.104
And that is what
God's punishing me for.

951
01:17:09.797 --> 01:17:12.248
- The hate.
- Punishing you?

952
01:17:16.873 --> 01:17:17.840
I have a lump...

953
01:17:19.117 --> 01:17:20.118
in my breast.

954
01:17:23.190 --> 01:17:24.191
Here.

955
01:17:29.852 --> 01:17:33.027
- There'll be no miracle for me.
- What does the doctor say?

956
01:17:36.893 --> 01:17:38.067
Have you been to a doctor?

957
01:17:46.385 --> 01:17:48.353
Why can't people like us
have miracles?

958
01:17:52.081 --> 01:17:53.979
Why can't I have a miracle?

959
01:17:56.741 --> 01:17:57.983
I go to Mass.

960
01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:01.297
- I come to Lourdes.
- We'll go together...

961
01:18:03.506 --> 01:18:05.542
to the doctor.
We'll find you the best one.

962
01:18:10.030 --> 01:18:10.996
I'll go with you.

963
01:18:22.767 --> 01:18:25.493
- Does it hurt?
- Yeah.

964
01:18:26.805 --> 01:18:30.326
- And that's bad. isn't it?
- No. That's... that's hopeful.

965
01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:34.917
Are you losing weight?

966
01:18:37.471 --> 01:18:39.093
Does it look like
I've lost weight?

967
01:18:39.093 --> 01:18:40.577
- You cow.

968
01:18:41.924 --> 01:18:43.788
- Well.

969
01:18:44.927 --> 01:18:48.137
- That is a very. very good sign.

970
01:19:28.798 --> 01:19:29.799
Dolly?

971
01:19:30.627 --> 01:19:32.802
George told me that
if I went to Lourdes

972
01:19:32.802 --> 01:19:36.426
- I shouldn't bother coming back.
- I'm sure he didn't mean it.

973
01:19:42.985 --> 01:19:44.814
Okay. Go get him. come on.

974
01:19:45.988 --> 01:19:46.954
Wish me luck.

975
01:19:58.863 --> 01:20:00.796
Mama.

976
01:20:01.486 --> 01:20:02.521
Hello.

977
01:20:03.799 --> 01:20:06.491
- Hi.  We've missed you.

978
01:20:06.491 --> 01:20:07.941
It was terrible quiet
without you.

979
01:20:09.287 --> 01:20:10.288
We missed you.

980
01:20:12.842 --> 01:20:13.809
Hiya. son.

981
01:20:15.224 --> 01:20:16.225
Did you enjoy yourself?

982
01:20:18.883 --> 01:20:19.849
Let me see.

983
01:20:24.198 --> 01:20:25.165
That is something.

984
01:20:35.382 --> 01:20:38.212
- Ah. love. Long lost love.
- We missed you.

985
01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:41.112
- Who is this little man?

986
01:20:41.112 --> 01:20:42.665
- It's so good to see you.
Hi.

987
01:20:42.665 --> 01:20:43.942
Hello.
Hi. Nana.

988
01:20:43.942 --> 01:20:45.979
Oh...  ...darling.
darling. look at you.

989
01:20:46.289 --> 01:20:47.290
Look at you.

990
01:20:47.808 --> 01:20:48.844
Hey.

991
01:20:51.018 --> 01:20:53.400
Ah. let a man at that.
would you?

992
01:20:54.539 --> 01:20:56.092
Frank. what have you done now?

993
01:20:56.610 --> 01:20:59.475
- Just trying to make you happy.
- Happy?

994
01:21:00.372 --> 01:21:01.649
What do you mean. happy?

995
01:21:02.650 --> 01:21:03.651
Happy.

996
01:21:07.414 --> 01:21:09.588
- Great to have you back.
- Oh.

997
01:21:14.421 --> 01:21:15.905
I think I had me a miracle.

998
01:21:16.975 --> 01:21:17.942
What?

999
01:21:18.770 --> 01:21:19.944
I actually missed you.

1000
01:21:22.222 --> 01:21:23.257
Aw.

1001
01:21:33.267 --> 01:21:35.960
- Oh. Tommy!

1002
01:21:36.581 --> 01:21:40.136
- You're still alive.
-  Just about.

1003
01:21:40.136 --> 01:21:43.105
Thought I'd hang around.
wanted to see your face.

1004
01:21:43.105 --> 01:21:46.418
- Oh. bless you. Tommy.

1005
01:21:49.076 --> 01:21:50.043
You look...

1006
01:21:51.009 --> 01:21:52.286
different.

1007
01:21:53.115 --> 01:21:54.254
You too.

1008
01:21:56.773 --> 01:21:58.051
Dada.

1009
01:22:02.365 --> 01:22:04.091
Where's Rosie?
Where's she gone?

1010
01:22:04.091 --> 01:22:06.162
Where is she?

1011
01:22:06.162 --> 01:22:07.508
There she is. There's Rosie.

1012
01:22:07.508 --> 01:22:09.683
Where's she gone?

1013
01:22:09.683 --> 01:22:11.098
- There's Rosie.
- Home.

1014
01:22:15.758 --> 01:22:18.588
I'm just got to go and see.
you know...

1015
01:22:18.588 --> 01:22:20.245
I know. I know.

1016
01:22:21.488 --> 01:22:22.765
Thank you. See you.

1017
01:22:23.593 --> 01:22:25.112
I want to show you something.

1018
01:22:26.010 --> 01:22:29.496
Will you come with me?
It's not that far.

1019
01:22:32.154 --> 01:22:33.983
It's a walk
I never thought

1020
01:22:33.983 --> 01:22:34.950
I'd take with you.
