00:08:39.606 --> 00:08:43.566
[laughing] I almost kept
a straight face.

175
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:45.960
Bullshit. You can't keep
a straight anything.

176
00:08:46.003 --> 00:08:47.309
Here. I'm tired of tending bar.

177
00:08:47.875 --> 00:08:49.050
Freshen my drink. you fruit.

178
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.270
I ever tell you about the
time I was stuck

179
00:08:52.314 --> 00:08:54.925
out on the Elsenborn
Ridge. and the only way

180
00:08:54.969 --> 00:08:58.842
I could keep my lap warm was
by spooning Orville Ketcham.

181
00:08:59.147 --> 00:09:00.931
-that Tommy from London?
-Vaguely.

182
00:09:02.498 --> 00:09:04.195
Say what you want
about the Tommies.

183
00:09:04.239 --> 00:09:07.198
but they've got some warm rumps.

184
00:09:07.459 --> 00:09:08.199
[chuckling] Okay.

185
00:09:10.419 --> 00:09:12.247
Hard to believe that
was a year ago.

186
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:18.122
I. I wanna thank you all
for being here.

187
00:09:19.994 --> 00:09:22.605
It's been a hard start to
the winter without Susie.

188
00:09:24.346 --> 00:09:25.869
-To Susan.
-Hear. hear.

189
00:09:26.217 --> 00:09:27.479
-To Susan.
-To Susie.

190
00:09:28.437 --> 00:09:30.091
Ah. Susie.

191
00:09:33.311 --> 00:09:34.748
[sad music]

192
00:09:35.879 --> 00:09:37.011
Well. it helps having you here.

193
00:09:40.101 --> 00:09:42.190
I never thought I'd spend
a Christmas without her.

194
00:09:43.234 --> 00:09:44.409
None of us did. Hock.

195
00:09:46.455 --> 00:09:51.155
It's been six weeks now
since she... checked out.

196
00:09:53.636 --> 00:09:57.205
I've been doing a lot
of reading. you know.

197
00:09:57.248 --> 00:10:01.165
to pass the time and keep
the wits about me.

198
00:10:03.037 --> 00:10:07.302
Started with psychology.
you know.

199
00:10:07.345 --> 00:10:09.521
thinking I could figure out
why she did what she did.

200
00:10:11.306 --> 00:10:13.264
But then I switched
to metaphysics.

201
00:10:13.874 --> 00:10:15.266
You ever heard that word?
I hadn't.

202
00:10:16.703 --> 00:10:23.100
Yeah. it's ghosts and
hokum. Weird nonsense.

203
00:10:23.797 --> 00:10:27.191
You know. just to keep hopeful.

204
00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:29.324
-Hopeful?
-Yeah.

205
00:10:29.367 --> 00:10:32.196
Stories of. o-of fellas
that can talk to the dead:

206
00:10:32.806 --> 00:10:37.506
mediums... clairvoyants...
spirit guides.

207
00:10:37.811 --> 00:10:40.944
Grifters. During the Great
War. my no-good uncle

208
00:10:40.988 --> 00:10:42.685
charged folks a buffalo nickel

209
00:10:43.338 --> 00:10:45.557
to give them messages
from their dead kids.

210
00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:48.125
They just wanna feel like
something else is out there.

211
00:10:49.561 --> 00:10:50.084
They're scared.

212
00:10:50.867 --> 00:10:51.912
It's all hooey.

213
00:10:53.261 --> 00:10:57.569
Ah well you know. but
outta every hundred cases

214
00:10:57.613 --> 00:11:01.443
that they debunk. all that
hooey. one or two check out.

215
00:11:02.487 --> 00:11:03.793
I mean. they got a whole society

216
00:11:03.837 --> 00:11:05.621
that keeps tabs on it in the UK.

217
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.233
Come on Hock. Now I've known you

218
00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:11.018
since we were eight years old.

219
00:11:12.628 --> 00:11:15.500
You used to laugh at people
who bought into this malarkey.

220
00:11:17.981 --> 00:11:19.853
Well. I'm not saying
that I believe it.

221
00:11:21.419 --> 00:11:26.947
But listen... you're all
here tonight and that's...

222
00:11:27.861 --> 00:11:28.905
that's very special.

223
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.910
And I'm just wondering
if you would humor me.

224
00:11:34.563 --> 00:11:40.003
♪ He's harmless with his woo.
it's only in his eyes♪

225
00:11:41.613 --> 00:11:45.705
Now. you probably all
think it's a load of bunk.

226
00:11:46.967 --> 00:11:49.926
But. uh... this séance thing.

227
00:11:51.275 --> 00:11:53.016
there's a lot of
corroborating evidence.

228
00:11:55.192 --> 00:11:57.586
Hock. I...

229
00:12:03.026 --> 00:12:07.291
Colonel. I know it's been
rough since Thanksgiving.

230
00:12:08.162 --> 00:12:09.729
but this is not the answer.

231
00:12:13.297 --> 00:12:17.824
So this. this is just...
it's silly.

232
00:12:21.871 --> 00:12:26.049
Sure. well maybe just
for a laugh.

233
00:12:26.528 --> 00:12:27.659
A laugh. Hock?

234
00:12:30.358 --> 00:12:31.185
This isn't funny.

235
00:12:38.975 --> 00:12:43.023
Listen. you can all
roll your eyes

236
00:12:43.066 --> 00:12:44.981
until they snap off
inside your head.

237
00:12:46.026 --> 00:12:47.854
But I started going to church

238
00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:54.295
three days a week
after Susie... left.

239
00:12:55.296 --> 00:12:57.254
I was looking for answers.

240
00:12:57.298 --> 00:13:00.083
You know. why she did
what she did.

241
00:13:01.737 --> 00:13:05.045
And afterwards. every
time I would sit down

242
00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.309
with the reverend and
he would tell me

243
00:13:08.352 --> 00:13:09.745
all about the afterlife.

244
00:13:11.268 --> 00:13:14.358
He would go on and on
about the glory of heaven

245
00:13:14.402 --> 00:13:16.839
and the fires of hell.

246
00:13:16.883 --> 00:13:18.623
He told me all about redemption.

247
00:13:19.624 --> 00:13:25.369
and all the babies in purgatory.
and everything in between.

248
00:13:27.154 --> 00:13:30.418
And after going to mass
for four weeks.

249
00:13:31.549 --> 00:13:34.944
like some sort of
brainwashed schmuck.

250
00:13:35.379 --> 00:13:38.078
that holier-than-thou son
of a bitch had the nerve

251
00:13:38.121 --> 00:13:41.690
to say that what Susie
did was unforgivable.

252
00:13:43.344 --> 00:13:48.262
That my wife. a good
church-going patriot.

253
00:13:49.567 --> 00:13:54.616
was damned to hell
because of what she did?!

254
00:13:55.922 --> 00:13:57.445
I mean. do you know why
she did what she did?!

255
00:13:59.447 --> 00:14:02.232
It was because of the
Krauts next door!

256
00:14:04.669 --> 00:14:06.976
She knew they were spying
for the Nazis!

257
00:14:10.588 --> 00:14:13.156
And I didn't believe her.
Nobody did.

258
00:14:14.157 --> 00:14:16.116
And she couldn't take that.

259
00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.380
She couldn't take
that her friends

260
00:14:19.423 --> 00:14:22.557
and her family didn't
believe her.

261
00:14:23.775 --> 00:14:25.212
But what was she gonna do?

262
00:14:25.255 --> 00:14:28.824
She put it in the reports.
and no one was listening.

263
00:14:29.259 --> 00:14:32.001
And then on
Thanksgiving morning.

264
00:14:33.263 --> 00:14:35.222
right before I went out
for a pack of Raleighs.

265
00:14:36.484 --> 00:14:37.398
she said it again.

266
00:14:39.052 --> 00:14:40.531
She said they were
moving in on her.

267
00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.794
that they knew that she knew.

268
00:14:44.971 --> 00:14:47.799
And I. I jus- I. I laughed.

269
00:14:48.844 --> 00:14:50.063
I just. I laughed at her.

270
00:14:51.368 --> 00:14:55.329
And then when I came
back. she was just all...

271
00:14:57.853 --> 00:15:01.857
and that priest. he had
the nerve to say

272
00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:03.685
that she was damned to hell.

273
00:15:05.687 --> 00:15:07.428
Well. I just walked out.

274
00:15:07.471 --> 00:15:12.433
I mean. I gave up. quit
believing in any of it.

275
00:15:12.476 --> 00:15:14.391
I decided right there and then

276
00:15:15.436 --> 00:15:17.612
that if Susie was
damned to hell.

277
00:15:17.655 --> 00:15:19.614
then the whole thing was
fucking bullshit!

278
00:15:22.051 --> 00:15:25.098
All of it! When you die.
it's just... just nothing.

279
00:15:25.402 --> 00:15:27.317
You're just fucking worm food.

280
00:15:28.231 --> 00:15:30.190
And then I started
thinking about that.

281
00:15:31.191 --> 00:15:35.760
and that seemed
[gasping] even scarier.

282
00:15:37.545 --> 00:15:42.593
So t-t-there's just nothing?
That Susie's just gone.

283
00:15:42.637 --> 00:15:45.466
Gone forever because I
didn't listen to her?

284
00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:48.556
-I didn't believe her?
-Hock.

285
00:15:49.513 --> 00:15:50.036
[sigh]

286
00:15:51.037 --> 00:15:52.908
Sweetheart. we all miss Susie.

287
00:15:54.127 --> 00:15:56.999
Then please. will you humor me?

288
00:15:59.045 --> 00:16:00.872
I mean. I think it's
abundantly clear

289
00:16:00.916 --> 00:16:02.222
that I'm not in a good place.

290
00:16:04.354 --> 00:16:06.008
I've held out as much hope
as any man can.

291
00:16:07.183 --> 00:16:11.231
And now I just. I need
you to do this.

292
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:15.191
I need this. I need
this from you.

293
00:16:16.062 --> 00:16:17.324
Here. Now.

294
00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:24.157
Sir. we are here for you.

295
00:16:25.549 --> 00:16:26.246
But not for this.

296
00:16:32.687 --> 00:16:34.167
I am not comfortable right now.

297
00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:35.951
Meet my friends. we're
never comfortable.

298
00:16:40.651 --> 00:16:43.611
[calming music]

299
00:16:45.656 --> 00:16:47.223
Sit down. Paul.

300
00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.314
Okay.

301
00:16:53.403 --> 00:16:59.018
Don't you just hope after
all this death. the war.

302
00:16:59.366 --> 00:17:02.499
all the nightmares... that
there's something else?

303
00:17:03.544 --> 00:17:06.025
I already believe Hock.
I don't need to see it.

304
00:17:07.939 --> 00:17:09.376
You remember Jimmy Rogers?

305
00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:13.205
That poor kid we tried to staple
back together in Normandy?

306
00:17:14.685 --> 00:17:18.211
Don't you just want to
know that he's still

307
00:17:18.253 --> 00:17:20.300
got that smile on his
face out there somewhere?

308
00:17:23.041 --> 00:17:23.825
What about you?

309
00:17:25.392 --> 00:17:28.830
Don't you wish you had proof
that all the other fellas

310
00:17:28.873 --> 00:17:32.964
at your base. they didn't
just burst into dust and flame

311
00:17:33.008 --> 00:17:35.184
when those Kraut bombs
came raining down on them?

312
00:17:37.273 --> 00:17:41.756
-And your wife. Clive.
-And my wife.

313
00:17:43.801 --> 00:17:44.976
All right. so where.

314
00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.630
where are you keeping
the Ouija board?

315
00:17:47.153 --> 00:17:48.328
Oh. well this is different.
Arch.

316
00:17:49.764 --> 00:17:52.027
See with Ouija. the spirits
speak through the board.

317
00:17:54.029 --> 00:17:56.814
writing messages and
stories and such.

318
00:17:57.511 --> 00:18:03.212
But with a séance. the spirits
speak directly through us.

319
00:18:04.561 --> 00:18:06.563
All you really need
is a mirror.

320
00:18:08.261 --> 00:18:12.047
and a couple of friends who
aren't afraid to hold hands.

321
00:18:12.395 --> 00:18:15.137
What do you say. Paulie? Will
you hold my hand?

322
00:18:19.185 --> 00:18:20.142
[laughing]

323
00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:21.839
I need a scotch.

324
00:18:21.883 --> 00:18:24.407
Ah. ah. ah... We're supposed
to have clear minds.

325
00:18:24.799 --> 00:18:26.496
Clear minds. Hock?

326
00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.542
You're three fucking
bottles in already.

327
00:18:28.933 --> 00:18:31.675
[scoffing] Well. then we
split this one.

328
00:18:31.936 --> 00:18:32.981
[glass slammed onto table]

329
00:18:43.774 --> 00:18:49.215
-[lights buzzing]
-[soft uneasy music]

330
00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:54.437
So they. they say if you
have something

331
00:18:54.481 --> 00:18:56.787
that belonged to the person
you're trying to contact.

332
00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:02.532
that it's a little easier.

333
00:19:02.576 --> 00:19:03.881
Is that Susan's handkerchief?

334
00:19:04.621 --> 00:19:05.970
Oh my God. Hock.

335
00:19:07.537 --> 00:19:09.670
-Why'd you hold onto that?
-[handkerchief ripping]

336
00:19:10.627 --> 00:19:12.238
I. I wanna be clear.

337
00:19:12.281 --> 00:19:15.415
I. I believe in the afterlife.
I believe in heaven and hell.

338
00:19:15.458 --> 00:19:18.200
I believe Susie's out there.
but I don't believe in this.

339
00:19:21.943 --> 00:19:25.076
-Look.
-[necklace clanking]

340
00:19:29.255 --> 00:19:32.345
if we can just make
contact with anyone.

341
00:19:34.042 --> 00:19:38.786
if we can just confirm that
there's something else.

342
00:19:39.395 --> 00:19:41.005
Whatever. Hock.

343
00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:44.531
Just don't play us for a
bunch of fools.

344
00:19:45.271 --> 00:19:47.186

00:41:06.551 --> 00:41:08.901
That's why he wanted me
to come here early today.

691
00:41:09.379 --> 00:41:10.163
What?

692
00:41:11.817 --> 00:41:14.167
That's what he'd been trying
to tell me all afternoon.

693
00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:17.736
-What?
-He wanted me to kill this woman

694
00:41:17.779 --> 00:41:19.477
before y'all even showed up.

695
00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:24.090
And right. right before he
popped himself.

696
00:41:25.047 --> 00:41:28.224
he said he needed me to
do something for him.

697
00:41:28.268 --> 00:41:29.965
before he would even
let me leave.

698
00:41:30.313 --> 00:41:32.751
I don't get it. If he
wanted to kill her.

699
00:41:32.794 --> 00:41:34.056
why didn't he just
do it himself?

700
00:41:35.623 --> 00:41:37.059
Because Hock wasn't a killer.

701
00:41:39.366 --> 00:41:42.543
I'm sorry. Colonel Clive
Hockstatter wasn't a killer?

702
00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:44.502
Oh. he had no problem
with killing.

703
00:41:45.459 --> 00:41:46.765
He just couldn't do it himself.

704
00:41:47.853 --> 00:41:49.811
He'd freeze up. look
like he was gonna heave.

705
00:41:49.855 --> 00:41:53.206
Any time there was blood.
he'd send in someone else

706
00:41:53.249 --> 00:41:56.035
to get their hands red.
someone like me.

707
00:41:56.992 --> 00:41:58.994
-That's drivel.
-No. it's true.

708
00:42:00.169 --> 00:42:03.521
No. no fellas. all those
stories he regaled to me.

709
00:42:03.564 --> 00:42:05.261
-on and on and--
-Marla.

710
00:42:05.305 --> 00:42:06.393
-What?
-That was bunko.

711
00:42:07.525 --> 00:42:09.265
You know how he felt about you.

712
00:42:11.354 --> 00:42:13.487
He would say anything to put
stars in your pretty eyes.

713
00:42:15.315 --> 00:42:19.275
Excuse me... may we please
get back to me?

714
00:42:19.841 --> 00:42:21.408
-Sure.
-Arch. knock it off.

715
00:42:21.451 --> 00:42:23.845
No. I want some straight
dope on why Susie and Hock

716
00:42:23.889 --> 00:42:25.238
thought this dame was a Nazi.

717
00:42:27.066 --> 00:42:30.156
Because. because I'm German...
Archie?

718
00:42:31.331 --> 00:42:32.767
Because I sound like the enemy.

719
00:42:33.638 --> 00:42:37.424
Well. if it looks like a duck
and it quacks like a duck.

720
00:42:37.816 --> 00:42:39.731
It could still be a goose.

721
00:42:41.602 --> 00:42:44.213
You know. when
we came to America...

722
00:42:45.345 --> 00:42:46.912
It was for a better life.

723
00:42:49.305 --> 00:42:51.656
They told us it was The
Great Melting Pot.

724
00:42:52.918 --> 00:42:56.617
A place where every
race. every religion.

725
00:42:57.662 --> 00:42:59.098
every language was welcome.

726
00:43:01.666 --> 00:43:04.146
Silver-tongued government
propaganda. all of it.

727
00:43:08.803 --> 00:43:11.371
Hey! That's Hock's booze.

728
00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:15.375
- Ja? well he owes me one.

729
00:43:17.725 --> 00:43:19.074
[Hildegard clears throat]

730
00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:23.949
It's easy to create an enemy.

731
00:43:25.428 --> 00:43:29.650
All you need are slanty
eyes. different color skin.

732
00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:32.000
or an accent.

733
00:43:35.177 --> 00:43:36.918
But it's always better
if they speak

734
00:43:36.962 --> 00:43:38.267
a different tongue. isn't it?

735
00:43:41.314 --> 00:43:43.882
Must be easier to kill someone
when you can't understand

736
00:43:43.925 --> 00:43:45.797
their cries for help.
-Shut up.

737
00:43:46.885 --> 00:43:49.191
You've killed a lot of
Germans. haven't you?

738
00:43:49.235 --> 00:43:50.628
So what's one more?

739
00:43:51.063 --> 00:43:53.805
But when was the last
time you killed someone

740
00:43:54.632 --> 00:43:56.372
who could tell you their
husband's name.

741
00:43:58.157 --> 00:44:00.159
or their children's
favorite radio show?

742
00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:01.290
[gun clicks]

743
00:44:02.857 --> 00:44:05.773
I'm not some nameless soldier
shouting fascist nonsense.

744
00:44:06.208 --> 00:44:08.297
I'm a green grocer who
came to New York

745
00:44:08.341 --> 00:44:10.125
chasing the American dream.

746
00:44:13.041 --> 00:44:17.829
My friends call me Hildy.
My husband's name is Juürgen.

747
00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:22.224
My girls go to PS 124.

748
00:44:25.053 --> 00:44:26.489
And we let them
stay up to listen

749
00:44:26.533 --> 00:44:28.056
to "The Charlotte
Greenwood Show".

750
00:44:30.232 --> 00:44:33.671
-Goddamn it.
-Are we good?

751
00:44:34.802 --> 00:44:39.589
No. I'm not gonna shoot
you. but I don't like you.

752
00:44:40.199 --> 00:44:41.287
I don't like your name.

753
00:44:42.549 --> 00:44:43.768
and I don't like you
living in my country.

754
00:44:45.552 --> 00:44:49.687
Well. suppose that's a start.
isn't it?

755
00:44:54.648 --> 00:44:56.041
Now. can we please
open the door?

756
00:44:56.476 --> 00:44:58.870
No. we cannot.

757
00:45:00.872 --> 00:45:02.787
You know. y'all might
fall for a solid

758
00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:06.225
dog and pony show. but not me.

759
00:45:09.228 --> 00:45:12.840
Let's see... when was
the last time

760
00:45:12.884 --> 00:45:15.625
I killed someone who
spoke English?

761
00:45:17.410 --> 00:45:19.586
Yeah. a year and
a half ago in Salerno.

762
00:45:21.153 --> 00:45:25.070
A weasely little Wop with
big brown eyes...

763
00:45:26.332 --> 00:45:28.943
Looked me up and down
half a dozen times

764
00:45:28.987 --> 00:45:31.903
before stammering out.
"I l-l-love America."

765
00:45:34.296 --> 00:45:36.559
[sips drink and sighs]

766
00:45:37.125 --> 00:45:38.692
I stabbed that little
Dago right in the mouth.

767
00:45:41.086 --> 00:45:41.956
Do you wanna know why?

768
00:45:44.045 --> 00:45:45.655
Because given half a chance.

769
00:45:45.699 --> 00:45:48.223
he would've done the
same Goddamn thing to me.

770
00:45:49.224 --> 00:45:52.227
Or maybe he was just a
scared Italian boy.

771
00:45:52.662 --> 00:45:54.795
who secretly loved America.

772
00:45:58.364 --> 00:46:00.758
Get those words outta your
mouth. you dirty Kraut.

773
00:46:02.411 --> 00:46:03.195
[glass hitting table]

774
00:46:04.762 --> 00:46:07.025
You don't get to talk about
my country. Neither did he.

775
00:46:09.549 --> 00:46:10.768
This is my country!!!

776
00:46:12.726 --> 00:46:13.379
Land of the free.

777
00:46:14.119 --> 00:46:16.034
Pssh! She's a Nazi!

778
00:46:17.122 --> 00:46:18.732
You say your last
name's DiFranco?

779
00:46:19.428 --> 00:46:20.821
What of it?

780
00:46:20.865 --> 00:46:23.998
You boast of killing
Italians. and yet you are one.

781
00:46:27.872 --> 00:46:29.003
She's takin' us for a walk.

782
00:46:30.048 --> 00:46:32.354
Jesus. Breathe. DiFranco.

783
00:46:32.659 --> 00:46:34.400
After all we've seen tonight.
she knows!

784
00:46:34.748 --> 00:46:35.793
What? What have you seen?

785
00:46:37.098 --> 00:46:38.186
You were in the closet.
didn't you hear it?

786
00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:40.406
Well. I. I was drugged.

787
00:46:40.449 --> 00:46:42.277
I-I think I'm still drugged.

788
00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:44.976
-Damn it.
-I heard voices.

789
00:46:45.411 --> 00:46:49.632
I heard Clive yelling and.
and a gunshot.

790
00:46:50.068 --> 00:46:52.244
I panicked. I started
kicking harder.

791
00:46:53.332 --> 00:46:57.292
There was a... a séance.
[chuckling]

792
00:46:58.903 --> 00:47:00.687
And we connected with. with-

793
00:47:01.079 --> 00:47:04.169
Why are you telling
her any of this?

794
00:47:04.909 --> 00:47:06.127
It was Susan! She told Clive--

795
00:47:06.171 --> 00:47:07.868
Shut up. Bob.

796
00:47:09.478 --> 00:47:11.437
What are you trying to
accomplish here Paul. huh?

797
00:47:13.265 --> 00:47:14.919
Open the Goddamn door!

798
00:47:14.962 --> 00:47:17.530
Or what. Marla? You
going to break my finger?

799
00:47:17.573 --> 00:47:18.618
Oh. I might.

800
00:47:19.924 --> 00:47:20.489
Why don't you just try
and interrogate it open?

801
00:47:20.533 --> 00:47:21.316
Okay.

802
00:47:22.448 --> 00:47:24.798
She's on the beam. Paul.
Open the door.

803
00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:26.408
Three minutes. Arch.

804
00:47:27.932 --> 00:47:30.151
That's how long it's been
since you've had your doubts.

805
00:47:30.195 --> 00:47:32.588
and now you're willing to let
this bitch stroll outta here.

806
00:47:33.938 --> 00:47:37.680
Classic. Right when I
need you. you turn faggot.

807
00:47:39.508 --> 00:47:40.466
Excuse me?

808
00:47:42.903 --> 00:47:43.686
You know what I mean.

809
00:47:44.992 --> 00:47:46.515
Yeah. I do. But I'm gonna
pretend like I don't

810
00:47:46.559 --> 00:47:48.300
and we're still being
cordial to one another.

811
00:47:48.343 --> 00:47:49.475
Oh. for God's sake.

812
00:47:49.518 --> 00:47:51.129
If you've got a problem Major.
speak up.

813
00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:54.045
But it'd better be
about Brownshirts.

814
00:47:54.088 --> 00:47:55.829
and not wearing I'm
dippin' my dick.

815
00:47:57.048 --> 00:47:58.179
We're on the same team. Paulie.

816
00:48:00.616 --> 00:48:04.838
Thanks for the reminder...
Baby Butcher.

817
00:48:05.056 --> 00:48:08.581
-[tense ominous music]
-What does that mean?

818
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:09.974
Nothin'.

819
00:48:11.801 --> 00:48:12.846
What does that mean. Paul?

820
00:48:14.543 --> 00:48:15.066
Well...

821
00:48:17.329 --> 00:48:21.159
it might mean. that Archie here.

822
00:48:22.290 --> 00:48:24.684
asked me to stand before
the grand jury

823
00:48:24.727 --> 00:48:26.077
and tell them that I did not see

824
00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:28.253
what I definitely saw
back in Berlin.

825
00:48:30.385 --> 00:48:31.430
All to protect my friend.

826
00:48:33.345 --> 00:48:34.999
and the reputation of
this great country.

827
00:48:36.217 --> 00:48:38.611
I knew it. Dammit. I
knew you did it.

828
00:48:38.654 --> 00:48:40.395
-Shut up.
-Archie?

829
00:48:43.442 --> 00:48:45.923
Paul... he did it?

830
00:48:46.662 --> 00:48:49.404
[soft uneasy music]

831
00:48:51.406 --> 00:48:52.190
You did it?

832
00:48:53.974 --> 00:48:55.062
Archie was right. Marla.

833
00:48:57.151 --> 00:48:59.806
You've never had two dozen
Nazis charging at you.

834
00:49:01.242 --> 00:49:03.244
He's not being tried
for killing Nazis. Paul.

835
00:49:06.291 --> 00:49:08.249
He's being tried
for killing children.

836
00:49:08.989 --> 00:49:11.209
[soft ominous music]

837
00:49:11.252 --> 00:49:14.038
You're Archibald Stanton.
from the news radio?

838
00:49:15.865 --> 00:49:17.867
The Berlin Butcher?

839
00:49:20.261 --> 00:49:22.307
You said the kid who who
did it was. was dead.

840
00:49:23.612 --> 00:49:24.396
Surprise.

841
00:49:27.442 --> 00:49:28.617
Oh. I'm going to be sick.

842
00:49:30.837 --> 00:49:31.969
Don't be so dramatic. Marla.

843
00:49:32.012 --> 00:49:33.231
You're starting to
sound like Hock.

844
00:49:33.274 --> 00:49:34.145
Shut up.

845
00:49:34.667 --> 00:49:35.842
I told you he did it.

846
00:49:38.236 --> 00:49:41.195
You wanna know what
happened. Marla? Huh?

847
00:49:43.981 --> 00:49:46.679
We were being picked off
by two Nazi sharpshooters.

848
00:49:47.941 --> 00:49:51.989
One by one. kid after
screaming all-American kid.

849
00:49:52.293 --> 00:49:53.991
Hock knew we had to
take that rooftop.

850
00:49:56.254 --> 00:50:00.214
So he told Archie that
if he led the charge

851
00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:04.001
and saved even one more of
our boys from sniper fire.

852
00:50:05.045 --> 00:50:07.091
he'd have a hero's
welcome when he got home.

853
00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:09.049
He said he was my Colonel.

854
00:50:10.398 --> 00:50:11.921
and that if anything went wrong.

855
00:50:11.965 --> 00:50:13.358
he would take responsibility.

856
00:50:14.185 --> 00:50:15.142
I didn't think about it.

857
00:50:16.274 --> 00:50:17.710
In war. you don't
have time to think.

858
00:50:17.753 --> 00:50:19.755
You look at the faces of the
men you've sworn to save.

859
00:50:19.799 --> 00:50:21.018
and you race into hell.

860
00:50:21.322 --> 00:50:22.671
And I... I ran straight for
that building.

861
00:50:24.151 --> 00:50:25.979
praying that if one of
the countless bullets

862
00:50:26.023 --> 00:50:28.199
I heard whizzing past
my ears actually hit me.

863
00:50:29.722 --> 00:50:32.855
that it'd be over quick.
and I wouldn't be left

864
00:50:32.899 --> 00:50:34.422
flopping around on the road.

865
00:50:35.684 --> 00:50:37.208
And I pressed against that wall.

866
00:50:37.251 --> 00:50:38.339
Oh God...

867
00:50:38.383 --> 00:50:40.037
Broke the first window
I came to and.

868
00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:44.606
tossed a belt of pineapples
into that building.

869
00:50:45.868 --> 00:50:49.046
It wasn't until after the
smoke cleared that we saw--

870
00:50:49.611 --> 00:50:51.526
It was a kindergarten center.

871
00:50:52.745 --> 00:50:54.355
I've been reading about
this for weeks.

872
00:50:55.965 --> 00:50:57.532
It was a children's shelter.

873
00:50:58.011 --> 00:50:59.230
War isn't fair. Kraut.

874
00:51:00.144 --> 00:51:02.102
I followed my orders
to the letter.

875
00:51:02.146 --> 00:51:03.930
I did exactly as I was told.

876
00:51:05.149 --> 00:51:06.628
Our boys took the roof.

877
00:51:07.325 --> 00:51:10.067
knocked off their snipers
and saved our soldiers.

878
00:51:11.242 --> 00:51:15.463
Fifty-six children.

879
00:51:16.073 --> 00:51:17.161
[sighs]

880
00:51:18.466 --> 00:51:19.859
You knew they were in there.

881
00:51:21.252 --> 00:51:23.080
Everyone knew they
were in there.

882
00:51:23.558 --> 00:51:25.038
It was a registered shelter.

883
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:28.128
Hock knew. He just didn't care.

884
00:51:28.607 --> 00:51:31.610
God... damn it.

885
00:51:32.219 --> 00:51:34.003
When the press asked. he
made up a story

886
00:51:34.047 --> 00:51:35.831
about a trigger-happy private.

887
00:51:36.354 --> 00:51:38.007
said he was killed in the blast.

888
00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:44.144
But people started talking.

889
00:51:45.928 --> 00:51:48.409
Soldiers started putting it
together and I. I got worried.

890
00:51:49.193 --> 00:51:50.672
but he said everything
was gonna be okay.

891
00:51:50.716 --> 00:51:53.458
He was gonna clear my name
and keep me outta prison.

892
00:51:54.937 --> 00:51:56.678
and that everyone was
going to eat crow.

893
00:51:59.116 --> 00:52:03.859
And that people would
stop saying those awful.

894
00:52:04.904 --> 00:52:07.689
awful things to my mama every
time she left her house.

895
00:52:08.995 --> 00:52:13.217
Well... Clive just blew his
brains out. so...

896
00:52:19.223 --> 00:52:23.140
-[dark music]
-I'm a good man.

897
00:52:25.011 --> 00:52:27.709
I mean. who. who... who are you?

898
00:52:30.059 --> 00:52:32.018
I mean. what. what kind of man?

899
00:52:32.279 --> 00:52:33.150
You can't say that.

900
00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:39.068
You weren't there... It happens.

901
00:52:40.287 --> 00:52:41.332
"It happens"?!

902
00:52:42.463 --> 00:52:44.944
God. all those kids.

903
00:52:45.945 --> 00:52:48.208
I mean. what kind
of man. would--

904
00:52:48.252 --> 00:52:49.166
[Hildegard] A good one.

905
00:52:50.689 --> 00:52:53.387
In war. good men are tasked
with doing terrible things

906
00:52:53.431 --> 00:52:54.519
every single day.

907
00:52:55.737 --> 00:52:57.391
This does not make them
terrible people.

908
00:52:58.610 --> 00:53:00.177
[Paul] And what do you
know about war?

909
00:53:01.395 --> 00:53:03.441
I know my family is
still in Berlin.

910
00:53:03.745 --> 00:53:05.747
My nieces and nephews...

911
00:53:06.966 --> 00:53:08.054
They could have been
in that school.

912
00:53:09.751 --> 00:53:12.885
but somehow I cannot call
you a monster. Major Stanton.

913
00:53:14.539 --> 00:53:17.194
You were fighting for
your country.

914
00:53:18.499 --> 00:53:19.718
You were doing your job.

915
00:53:20.284 --> 00:53:22.634
-[soft ominous music]
-I was... I still am.

916
00:53:25.637 --> 00:53:26.986
I'm not a bad man.

917
00:53:27.769 --> 00:53:30.032
No. none of us are bad.

918
00:53:30.468 --> 00:53:33.819
We simply do as. as we
are commanded.

919
00:53:35.429 --> 00:53:37.997
And just who is your Commander?

920
00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:42.784
I thought you worked in
a grocery store

921
00:53:42.828 --> 00:53:44.308
with your father-in-law.

922
00:53:44.612 --> 00:53:46.048
Ja. I do.

923
00:53:46.527 --> 00:53:48.137
And you call him... Commander?

924
00:53:48.181 --> 00:53:50.662
No. no. I do not call
him Commander.

925
00:53:50.705 --> 00:53:54.100
I. I work for him. so
I do as as he commands.

926
00:53:54.492 --> 00:53:55.884
Don't play with me. bitch.

927
00:53:57.321 --> 00:53:59.236
I can see your mask slipping

928
00:53:59.279 --> 00:54:00.889
every time you open your mouth.

929
00:54:02.326 --> 00:54:05.416
I have tried to express to
you that I do not believe

930
00:54:05.459 --> 00:54:08.506
a man's singular actions
make him evil.

931
00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:10.899
Especially if that man believes

932
00:54:10.943 --> 00:54:12.640
that what he is doing is moral.

933
00:54:13.772 --> 00:54:16.209
I do not believe Major
Stanton to be a bad man.

934
00:54:16.253 --> 00:54:18.733
simply because he was
following orders.

935
00:54:19.473 --> 00:54:22.041
Just like I do not believe
you to. to be a bad man.

936
00:54:22.389 --> 00:54:24.435
because you are trying
to protect your friend.

937
00:54:24.783 --> 00:54:25.958
and your country.

938
00:54:28.526 --> 00:54:29.091
Say it.

939
00:54:32.965 --> 00:54:35.968
Some days I can even
try to believe

940
00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:39.232
that my mentally ill
neighbors who were only acting

941
00:54:39.276 --> 00:54:42.148
out of a crushing love for
their government and homeland

942
00:54:43.192 --> 00:54:45.412
were not bad people.

943
00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:47.240
[Paul] Say it.

944
00:54:49.503 --> 00:54:55.204
My name is Hildy Bauman. I
moved to New York in 1931.

945
00:54:57.032 --> 00:54:59.208
My father-in-law owns the
grocery two blocks away.

946
00:54:59.252 --> 00:55:02.342
I work there! I live
three doors down from here

947
00:55:02.386 --> 00:55:04.779
with my husband and
my two girls.

948
00:55:04.823 --> 00:55:10.045
-Say it.
-[soft uneasy music]

949
00:55:14.528 --> 00:55:18.315
-I am an American.
-Liar!!!

950
00:55:18.706 --> 00:55:22.449
Can we please just open the
door and call the police?

951
00:55:22.493 --> 00:55:24.103
-[radio screeching]
-♪ Is you is or is you ain't♪

952
00:55:24.146 --> 00:55:25.887
-Not again.
-For God's sake.

953
00:55:26.671 --> 00:55:27.454
[radio stops]

954
00:55:30.414 --> 00:55:31.893
What are you
gonna do. Paul? Huh?!

955
00:55:32.503 --> 00:55:34.809
Kill her right here in
Hock's brownstone?! Is that--

956
00:55:34.853 --> 00:55:36.855
Just open the door. Paul!

957
00:55:36.898 --> 00:55:39.205
They're right Major.
open the door.

958
00:55:39.248 --> 00:55:40.946
We're losing our
heaven-sent minds.

959
00:55:41.642 --> 00:55:42.339
You can't mean that.

960
00:55:43.209 --> 00:55:44.166
Please. Major.

961
00:55:48.606 --> 00:55:50.042
I can't believe what
I'm hearing.

962
00:55:52.784 --> 00:55:56.788
Archie. you are an
American hero.

963
00:55:58.746 --> 00:55:59.747
You're not the kind
of man who lets

964
00:55:59.791 --> 00:56:01.880
a Nazi spy walk out of a room.

965
00:56:04.491 --> 00:56:05.884
-Marla.
-What?

966
00:56:06.188 --> 00:56:07.712
The Krauts bombed your base.

967
00:56:07.755 --> 00:56:09.322
Yeah.

968
00:56:09.366 --> 00:56:12.281
They burnt your pretty body
and left you with a gimp leg.

969
00:56:12.325 --> 00:56:14.893
They killed every friend
you had outside this room.

970
00:56:14.936 --> 00:56:15.850
I know.

971
00:56:17.722 --> 00:56:19.027
-Bob.
-Yeah?

972
00:56:21.726 --> 00:56:24.119
Well. I don't know tits
about what it is you do.

973
00:56:25.207 --> 00:56:28.254
But somehow I doubt that
the Pentagon would allow

974
00:56:28.297 --> 00:56:30.169
a Nazi sympathizer to
push their pencils.

975
00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:38.786
Really? Nobody?

976
00:56:41.528 --> 00:56:46.011
Well in that case Major.
I'll make you a deal.

977
00:56:48.317 --> 00:56:53.322
I give you the key. you
give me the gun.

978
00:56:53.627 --> 00:56:54.933
Absolutely not.

979
00:56:54.976 --> 00:56:56.587
I am not speaking to you. Bob.

980
00:56:57.239 --> 00:57:00.025
I'm sorry Major. but I
can't do that.

981
00:57:04.290 --> 00:57:08.425
Well then. I guess we'd
better get cozy.

982
00:57:09.295 --> 00:57:11.645
To hell with you then.
and to hell with this!

983
00:57:11.689 --> 00:57:13.299
Archie. what are you doing?!

984
00:57:13.342 --> 00:57:15.823
[gunshots]

985
00:57:17.129 --> 00:57:20.915
[grunting] God damn it!

986
00:57:21.350 --> 00:57:25.659
[gasping] I- I don't understand.

987
00:57:30.142 --> 00:57:31.622
-Why won't it open?
-[gun blasting]

988
00:57:34.059 --> 00:57:35.234
Check the rounds.

989
00:57:35.277 --> 00:57:37.845
[gun clicking]

990
00:57:37.889 --> 00:57:40.065
Well. the bullet Clive
used sure worked!

991
00:57:40.108 --> 00:57:44.199
Enough! Paul I need you
to take the key

992
00:57:44.243 --> 00:57:47.159
out of your pocket and
open the goddam door.

993
00:57:47.812 --> 00:57:49.509
This is not up for discussion.

994
00:57:50.031 --> 00:57:52.251
and I don't want to point
a weapon at my friend.

995
00:57:53.557 --> 00:57:55.384
Oh. Archie...

996
00:57:57.256 --> 00:57:58.083
Please. Major?

997
00:58:00.128 --> 00:58:03.480
Fine. Fuck all'a ya.

998
00:58:10.095 --> 00:58:14.447
But. if you make me
open this door

999
00:58:16.057 --> 00:58:18.059
and go against everything I am.

1000
00:58:20.671 --> 00:58:22.803
I will not take the stand
for you. Archie.

1001
00:58:25.284 --> 00:58:29.810
Oh. I will stand. before
my God and my country.

1002
00:58:31.029 --> 00:58:33.379
and I will tell them how
you spinelessly

1003
00:58:33.422 --> 00:58:36.121
blew those toddlers
limb from limb.

1004
00:58:36.164 --> 00:58:38.166
just like the newsmen
say you did.

1005
00:58:38.732 --> 00:58:42.475
Hock had me come early
before any of y'all.

1006
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:48.089
to do what he couldn't do.
what. what Susie couldn't do.

1007
00:58:48.873 --> 00:58:50.657
He wanted me to kill this woman.

1008
00:58:51.919 --> 00:58:53.834
And if you make me
open this door.

1009
00:58:54.618 --> 00:58:57.490
I will follow that Nazi
home and beat her to death

1010
00:58:57.534 --> 00:58:58.622
in front of her family.

1011
00:58:58.665 --> 00:59:01.102
-[gun clicking]
-[soft tense music]

1012
00:59:01.146 --> 00:59:02.930
I am not a Nazi.

1013
00:59:02.974 --> 00:59:04.802
-[cane crashing]
-That's it!!!

1014
00:59:05.803 --> 00:59:06.891
What's it?

1015
00:59:07.282 --> 00:59:08.501
You wanna know if she's a Nazi.
Paul?

1016
00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:10.503
Huh? Is that it? You want proof?

1017
00:59:11.243 --> 00:59:12.200
Is that the only way
you're gonna let us out

1018
00:59:12.244 --> 00:59:13.593
of this Goddamn room?

1019
00:59:13.898 --> 00:59:15.029
I already know.

1020
00:59:15.639 --> 00:59:16.465
You don't know squat.

1021
00:59:17.554 --> 00:59:18.816
And if you're not
gonna help. and

1022
00:59:18.859 --> 00:59:20.557
if you're just gonna
panic. I'm taking charge.

1023
00:59:23.385 --> 00:59:25.431
If this were my base. I'd
demand all three of you

1024
00:59:25.474 --> 00:59:27.955
get out of this room. but
apparently that's not an option.

1025
00:59:27.999 --> 00:59:30.610
-So get over there.
-What?

1026
00:59:30.915 --> 00:59:32.133
Go over there. all of you.

1027
00:59:33.308 --> 00:59:34.614
What are you doing. Marla?

1028
00:59:35.659 --> 00:59:38.096
My job... my shitty job.

1029
00:59:38.662 --> 00:59:40.272
Marla. I don't think
that's the best idea.

1030
00:59:40.315 --> 00:59:42.230
You know what? I'm
all out of ideas.

1031
00:59:44.406 --> 00:59:46.104
This will confirm it one
way or another. go on.

1032
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:51.892
Go on.

1033
00:59:55.417 --> 00:59:56.418
Sit. Frau Bauman.

1034
00:59:57.985 --> 01:00:00.858
Um... why?

1035
01:00:01.902 --> 01:00:03.121
Because I told you to.

1036
01:00:04.122 --> 01:00:07.038
[soft ominous music]

1037
01:00:16.525 --> 01:00:20.617
[cane tapping]

1038
01:00:27.014 --> 01:00:28.189
I don't think you're a spy.

1039
01:00:29.582 --> 01:00:31.149
-Thank you.
-Don't thank me.

1040
01:00:34.282 --> 01:00:36.589
We've apparently found
ourselves in a situation

1041
01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:38.156
where you and I can't
leave this room

1042
01:00:38.199 --> 01:00:40.158
until we are certain
you're not a Nazi.

1043
01:00:47.121 --> 01:00:48.470
Hold my hand. Hildy.

1044
01:00:52.431 --> 01:00:57.001
[soft ominous music]

1045
01:00:58.089 --> 01:00:58.872
Fuck you. Paul.

1046
01:00:59.873 --> 01:01:01.092
What. what is-

1047
01:01:01.396 --> 01:01:02.180
Sh-sh-sh.

1048
01:01:03.442 --> 01:01:07.925
[speaking in German]

1049
01:01:08.403 --> 01:01:09.187
Hmm?

1050
01:01:10.797 --> 01:01:11.624
Mm-hmm.

1051
01:01:13.452 --> 01:01:15.149
Stay with me now. Hildy.
Here we go.

1052
01:01:19.066 --> 01:01:21.939
You need to listen to me very
closely right now Hildy. hmm?

1053
01:01:24.942 --> 01:01:27.031
If you stand up. you'll
be admitting guilt.

1054
01:01:28.597 --> 01:01:30.643
If you attempt to break free.
you'll be admitting guilt.

1055
01:01:31.383 --> 01:01:33.602
You will stay seated
with your hand in mine.

1056
01:01:33.646 --> 01:01:36.083
until I tell you our time
together is complete.

1057
01:01:36.867 --> 01:01:38.129
-But--
-You will answer

1058
01:01:38.172 --> 01:01:39.739
every question no matter
how many times I ask it.

1059
01:01:43.743 --> 01:01:45.179
And although it might
seem otherwise.

1060
01:01:45.223 --> 01:01:47.094
you and I are alone.
quite alone right now.

1061
01:01:52.143 --> 01:01:55.712
Now. what is your full name?

1062
01:01:56.669 --> 01:01:58.192
Um. Hildegard Bauman.

1063
01:02:00.673 --> 01:02:02.370
Are you now. or have
you ever been

1064
01:02:02.414 --> 01:02:04.764
a member of the National
Socialist German Workers Party?

1065
01:02:05.939 --> 01:02:07.767
No. the Nazi party no
longer exists.

1066
01:02:07.811 --> 01:02:08.812
That's not what I asked.

1067
01:02:09.247 --> 01:02:12.076
No. no. no. no. no. Mm-mm. No.

1068
01:02:14.208 --> 01:02:15.514
Who's your primary employer?

1069
01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:17.472
Bergen Street Grocery.

1070
01:02:17.908 --> 01:02:19.257
What's your husband's full name?

1071
01:02:20.824 --> 01:02:23.174
-Juürgen Bauman.
-Mm-hmm.

1072
01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:29.093
What are your daughter's names?

1073
01:02:33.662 --> 01:02:35.186
Robin and Melissa Bauman.

1074
01:02:38.667 --> 01:02:40.234
Why did Susan
Hockstatter believe

1075
01:02:40.278 --> 01:02:42.149
you were a spy for the
German government?

1076
01:02:42.193 --> 01:02:43.760
Because she was a sick woman.

1077
01:02:43.803 --> 01:02:44.630
Bullshit.

1078
01:02:46.937 --> 01:02:48.112
Did you want me to stop. Paul?

1079
01:02:50.941 --> 01:02:52.333
Why did Susan
Hockstatter believe

1080
01:02:52.377 --> 01:02:54.074
you were a spy for the
German government?

1081
01:02:54.118 --> 01:02:55.989
-I told you.
-You will answer.

1082
01:02:56.381 --> 01:02:58.513
Oh. no. [gasping]

1083
01:02:58.557 --> 01:03:01.081
All of my questions. no matter
how many times I ask them.

1084
01:03:02.822 --> 01:03:04.258
Why did Susan
Hockstatter...

1085
01:03:06.347 --> 01:03:08.436
believe you were a spy for the
German government?

1086
01:03:09.698 --> 01:03:11.526
Because. because I
have an accent.

1087
01:03:11.570 --> 01:03:16.009
Because she needed a
personification of her fears.

1088
01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:19.230
Because she wasn't ready
for this war to be over.

1089
01:03:21.014 --> 01:03:22.363
And her husband.
Clive Hockstatter?

1090
01:03:23.756 --> 01:03:25.976
He- he didn't believe
her when she was alive.

1091
01:03:26.628 --> 01:03:28.805
It was only after she
died that he needed

1092
01:03:28.848 --> 01:03:31.416
a- a target to aim
his guilt at.

1093
01:03:32.852 --> 01:03:34.288
I became that target.

1094
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:36.987
You do realize the
Hockstatters were not religious

1095
01:03:37.030 --> 01:03:38.597
or political fanatics. correct?

1096
01:03:39.728 --> 01:03:41.426
That they were
high-ranking military.

1097
01:03:42.079 --> 01:03:44.037
and upstanding members of
their community?

1098
01:03:45.604 --> 01:03:46.866
- Ja.
-Yeah.

1099
01:03:47.693 --> 01:03:51.392
But they were
sick people. [screaming]

1100
01:03:51.436 --> 01:03:55.048
Hildy! Fraäulein!
Are you now.

1101
01:03:55.657 --> 01:03:57.398
or have you ever been a
member of the Nazi party?

1102
01:03:57.834 --> 01:03:59.836
Nein... Nein...

1103
01:04:00.227 --> 01:04:03.230
Are you now or have you
ever been a member

1104
01:04:03.274 --> 01:04:05.580
of the National Socialist
German Workers Party?

1105
01:04:06.625 --> 01:04:09.846
What? ...No! [screaming]

1106
01:04:09.889 --> 01:04:12.196
Are you now. or have
you ever been a member

1107
01:04:12.239 --> 01:04:15.286
of the National Socialist
German Workers Party?

1108
01:04:16.548 --> 01:04:19.072
Nein... Nein.

1109
01:04:21.422 --> 01:04:22.510
What's your full name?

1110
01:04:24.121 --> 01:04:29.648
Hildy... [whimpering]
Hildegard Bauman.

1111
01:04:32.477 --> 01:04:33.608
Verzeíhung.

1112
01:04:33.652 --> 01:04:39.310
[Hildegard gasping]

1113
01:04:44.228 --> 01:04:45.011
[cane tapping]

1114
01:04:48.841 --> 01:04:50.451
Open the door Paul.
She's not a Nazi.

1115
01:04:51.844 --> 01:04:52.932
Open the door!

1116
01:04:57.763 --> 01:04:58.895
I can't believe what
I'm hearing.

1117
01:05:00.548 --> 01:05:02.072
Is that all you're
going to do to her?

1118
01:05:02.724 --> 01:05:04.074
You wanna do my job for me.
Paul?

1119
01:05:04.726 --> 01:05:07.381
No. but I. I just-

1120
01:05:07.947 --> 01:05:09.253
That's all I needed to do. Paul.

1121
01:05:10.471 --> 01:05:11.211
I have my answer.

1122
01:05:12.821 --> 01:05:14.475
And if you have any
respect for me whatsoever.

1123
01:05:14.519 --> 01:05:15.999
you'll take that as
your answer too.

1124
01:05:17.696 --> 01:05:23.745
Earlier you said um.
faith was about

1125
01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:27.575
what you couldn't see?
About what you believe?

1126
01:05:30.665 --> 01:05:31.797
Well. I know what I believe.

1127
01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:33.320
Open the damn door.

1128
01:05:36.541 --> 01:05:37.934
[footsteps]

1129
01:05:40.545 --> 01:05:42.286
Marla. you are the finest woman

1130
01:05:42.329 --> 01:05:43.983
the US military has ever seen.

1131
01:05:44.462 --> 01:05:45.245
I'm not.

1132
01:05:46.377 --> 01:05:48.292
It's such a goddam
shame you ended up

1133
01:05:48.335 --> 01:05:50.163
with this pencil neck.

1134
01:05:50.772 --> 01:05:51.556
[Marla scoffs]

1135
01:05:55.473 --> 01:05:57.736
[footsteps]

1136
01:06:00.086 --> 01:06:06.179
-[key clicking]
-[strange. eerie music]

1137
01:06:07.615 --> 01:06:08.573
What the hell?

1138
01:06:10.401 --> 01:06:14.187
The. the key it just. it
just disappeared.

1139
01:06:14.231 --> 01:06:15.754
Paul. don't you dare.

1140
01:06:15.797 --> 01:06:17.712
The door. the door just ate it.

1141
01:06:17.756 --> 01:06:19.584
[Bob] That's a load of baloney.
Paul.

1142
01:06:19.627 --> 01:06:20.846
[Marla] What did you do?

1143
01:06:20.889 --> 01:06:22.979
I didn't do any. do you
see it on me anywhere?

1144
01:06:23.022 --> 01:06:24.502
-Paul!
-Come on.

1145
01:06:24.545 --> 01:06:25.633
I didn't do anything.

1146
01:06:25.677 --> 01:06:27.070
Well. somebody better
do something.

1147
01:06:27.896 --> 01:06:29.420
[Clive] Somebody...

1148
01:06:30.073 --> 01:06:31.683
[ominous music]

1149
01:06:31.726 --> 01:06:36.557
[Clive breathing]

1150
01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:39.865
Somebody is.

1151
01:06:40.648 --> 01:06:44.652
going to do something.

1152
01:06:45.653 --> 01:06:48.613
[Hildegard gasping]

1153
01:06:48.917 --> 01:06:50.745
[Clive gasping]

1154
01:06:51.050 --> 01:06:52.443
No. no. no. no. no. no.
no. no. no. I. what?

1155
01:06:57.578 --> 01:07:02.322
[gasping] Somebody is
going to

1156
01:07:02.757 --> 01:07:06.587
kill... that... Nazi.

1157
01:07:07.719 --> 01:07:09.068
Leiber Gott!

1158
01:07:09.112 --> 01:07:10.417
-Clive--
-He's dead. right?

1159
01:07:10.461 --> 01:07:11.853
-Clive?
-He's very dead.

1160
01:07:12.898 --> 01:07:14.291
Well. he doesn't sound dead!

1161
01:07:14.726 --> 01:07:17.555
[soft ominous music]

1162
01:07:20.862 --> 01:07:23.213
Major...

1163
01:07:26.564 --> 01:07:29.610
No. no. no... This. this
isn't. this isn't right.

1164
01:07:30.959 --> 01:07:34.485
-Help. somebody help!
-Can anyone hear us?!

1165
01:07:34.528 --> 01:07:36.574
Help! Help! Help!

1166
01:07:36.617 --> 01:07:38.532
Ich muss hier raus.
verdammt nochmal!

1167
01:07:39.794 --> 01:07:42.493
-Shut up...
-Can anyone help me?!

1168
01:07:42.536 --> 01:07:44.408
Help! Help! Help!

1169
01:07:44.451 --> 01:07:47.802
Outta the way!

1170
01:07:48.151 --> 01:07:53.504
Shut up... shut up!

1171
01:07:53.547 --> 01:07:54.418
[poker clangs on floor]

1172
01:07:56.420 --> 01:07:57.421
Shut up!!!

1173
01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:05.733
Hock?

1174
01:08:08.432 --> 01:08:13.611
Oh. what is going on?
[clearing throat]

1175
01:08:20.747 --> 01:08:23.099
-Colonel?
-Be careful.

1176
01:08:23.707 --> 01:08:26.928
[soft ominous music]

1177
01:08:35.502 --> 01:08:36.068
Colonel?

1178
01:08:40.377 --> 01:08:42.466
Kill... her.

1179
01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:49.037
What?

1180
01:08:50.648 --> 01:08:55.218
Kill... the... Nazi.

1181
01:08:59.221 --> 01:09:01.136
[heavy breathing]
[clears throat]

1182
01:09:07.273 --> 01:09:08.100
Okay.

1183
01:09:09.188 --> 01:09:11.886
No! Nein!
No. no. no! Please.

1184
01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:13.888
-No. Paul.
-Please. please.

1185
01:09:15.238 --> 01:09:16.108
You heard him.

1186
01:09:17.935 --> 01:09:19.546
Oh. this is hell. this room...

1187
01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:22.462
[soft ominous music]

1188
01:09:29.121 --> 01:09:32.429
And we're locked in it until
one of us offs this Kraut.

1189
01:09:33.865 --> 01:09:35.953
There. there must be
another way.

1190
01:09:35.997 --> 01:09:38.216
Oh. I pray there isn't.

1191
01:09:38.609 --> 01:09:39.740
There has to be.

1192
01:09:40.263 --> 01:09:44.049
This. this is why we
are here tonight.

1193
01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:47.835
Not for support. not to
save our friend.

1194
01:09:47.879 --> 01:09:49.968
He was dead before we
even got here.

1195
01:09:51.404 --> 01:09:53.798
Hock needs one of us to
get our hands red.

1196
01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:58.455
Wait... we finish the séance.

1197
01:09:59.934 --> 01:10:01.675
-What?
-Yeah. we. we finish the séance.

1198
01:10:02.110 --> 01:10:03.547
We're. we're still in
another realm.

1199
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:06.202
Hock said if we uncoupled
our hands during the séance.

1200
01:10:06.245 --> 01:10:07.507
that the door would stay open.

1201
01:10:07.551 --> 01:10:09.422
The door is locked. Marla.

1202
01:10:09.466 --> 01:10:12.208
Not the parlor door! The door
to the other side. you know?

1203
01:10:13.296 --> 01:10:14.993
But if we can close that door.

1204
01:10:15.385 --> 01:10:19.476
whatever's keeping us in
here has to go back. correct?

1205
01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:21.304
That's insane.

1206
01:10:21.347 --> 01:10:23.784
Our dead friend says
we have to kill

1207
01:10:23.828 --> 01:10:25.743
