00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:15.015
- [Man] Another glass?

6
00:00:17.226 --> 00:00:18.352
- [Woman] I had one.

7
00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:19.144
- [Man] Today?

8
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.066
Just don't understand
why you have to drink.

9
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:27.069
- I'm not drinking.
- You just had another glass!

10
00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:28.028
- [Woman] Why do
you feel this need

11
00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:29.863
to control everything that I do?

12
00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:31.531
- I am concerned.
- Oh. really?

13
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:33.158
You're concerned?
- Here we go.

14
00:00:35.244 --> 00:00:36.620
- Don't do that.

15
00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:40.165
- I have given you no
reason not to trust me.

16
00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:45.170
- Really?

17
00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:49.383
Because I see the way that
you talk to your co-workers.

18
00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:51.009
- They're my co-workers.

19
00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:53.637
- And your texts back and
forth. what's her name again?

20
00:00:53.637 --> 00:00:55.264
- These are your
own god damn issues

21
00:00:55.264 --> 00:00:57.099
that you have to get over.

22
00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:59.226
I have been faithful
to you. Olivia!

23
00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:00.894
- Yeah.

24
00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:01.645
For now.

25
00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:07.901
- Okay. so you're
gonna crucify me

26
00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:10.487
for something I have not done.

27
00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:14.116
Meanwhile. I come in
here. and you're drinking!

28
00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.996
(glass smashes)

29
00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:22.874
I'm done.

30
00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:30.299
(door clacks)

31
00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:38.223

(Olivia sighs)

35
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.873
- Happy birthday. Dad.

36
00:02:04.207 --> 00:02:06.752
- [Father] So I have
to call you. huh?

37
00:02:06.752 --> 00:02:10.005
- I'm sorry.
- No. no. I know you're busy.

38
00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:11.131
Too busy for your dad.

39
00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:15.135
- How was your day?

40
00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:17.429
- How was my day. well.

41
00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:19.306
your mother's taking
me out to dinner.

42
00:02:20.307 --> 00:02:21.183
- Lucky you.

43
00:02:24.186 --> 00:02:25.854
- So how about you. kiddo?

44
00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:27.314
Are you doin' okay?

45
00:02:32.736 --> 00:02:34.321
- Yeah.

46
00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:35.614
Yeah. I'm fine.

47
00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:40.202
- Are you sure about that?

48
00:02:41.453 --> 00:02:42.371
- Miss you.

49
00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:47.876
- I know. I miss you. too.

50
00:02:49.795 --> 00:02:52.255
Look. why don't
you come home. huh?

51
00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:53.924
- [Olivia] You know
I can't do that.

52
00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:56.134
Can't be around her.

53
00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:03.308
- Yeah. I know.
(muffled footsteps clack)

54
00:03:04.226 --> 00:03:05.227
(knocks on glass)

55
00:03:05.227 --> 00:03:06.645
Hey. sweetheart.
hold on one sec.

56
00:03:06.645 --> 00:03:08.688
(window whines)
(suspenseful music)

57
00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:09.898
Yeah. can I help you?

58
00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:14.528
- Dad?

59
00:03:14.528 --> 00:03:16.822
(phone bleeps)

60
00:03:16.822 --> 00:03:17.614
Hello?

61
00:03:30.252 --> 00:03:31.294
(phone rings)

62
00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:33.755
(phone bleeps)

63
00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.968
- [Man] The search
continues for famed

64
00:03:37.968 --> 00:03:40.011
children's book author.
Stanley Prescott.

65
00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:41.221
- [Woman] We all
love him so much.

66
00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:42.722
I pray to God that he's okay.

67
00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:44.433
- [Man] But how does somebody
like Stanley Prescott

68
00:03:44.433 --> 00:03:45.976
just go missing?

69
00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:47.769
He's the most important
person on the friggin' island.

70
00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.021
- [Man] I mean. he's definitely
the wealthiest. (chuckles)

71
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:51.314
- [Man] But him and his wife

72
00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:52.482
always give back
to the community.

73
00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:54.401
- [Man] They do. they do.

74
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:56.528
- [Woman] I spoke with
Father James yesterday.

75
00:03:56.528 --> 00:03:58.697
He said "don't give
up on Stanley."

76
00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:01.408
- [Man] I'll be honest with you.

77
00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:02.576
I don't think he's
on the island.

78
00:04:02.576 --> 00:04:04.244
- [Man] You think he took off?

79
00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:07.372
- [Man] I'll be surprised if
his body washes up on shore.

80
00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:11.084
(ominous orchestral music)

81
00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:26.683
(distant boat horn blows)
(wings flap)

82
00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:48.330
(crickets chirp)

83
00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:57.214
(door creaks)

84
00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:02.344
- She's a good picture-taker.

85
00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:06.765
Olivia's in New York now
and she is taking pictures.

86
00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:09.893
which is some sort of hobby.

87
00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:11.770
(coughs) There she finally is.

88
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:12.687
- Hello.
- Olivia.

89
00:05:14.272 --> 00:05:17.400
Look at you. you have
that wonderful baby glow.

90
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.402
- Beautiful.
(Olivia chuckles)

91
00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:21.029
- I thought you would
be here by three.

92
00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:28.411
- Any word?

93
00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:29.454
- Nothing. no.

94
00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:31.540
They're still searching.

95
00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:35.752
- They're going to find
your father. I know it.

96
00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:44.511
- (laughs) Well. probably
run off with some whore.

97
00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:47.430
- [Woman] Jesus. Susan.
don't say such a thing!

98
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.848
- [Susan] He's never home.

99
00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:51.935
(water splashes)
(footsteps clack)

100
00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:55.522
- [Woman] Hey. you
shouldn't be doing those.

101
00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:56.773
- It's fine.

102
00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:58.900
- You know. I remember
when I was pregnant.

103
00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.069
I used to send Chris out
in the middle of the night.

104
00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:02.654
because I was
craving pineapples.

105
00:06:04.948 --> 00:06:08.702
He'd play music for Darren
when he was still in my belly.

106
00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:11.121
He'd sing to him.

107
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:12.455
- Thought about adoption.

108
00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:15.458
- Oh. well. you know.

109
00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:18.461
there's a lot of couples out
there that can't have children.

110
00:06:19.963 --> 00:06:21.673
A baby is a blessing from God.

111
00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:24.050
and God gave him to
us for a reason. so.

112
00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:30.473
- I have to go to the bathroom.

113
00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:33.351
(dark orchestral music)
(footsteps clack)

114
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:35.729
(bulb buzzes)

115
00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:41.484
(sniffles)

116
00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:44.446
- Yeah.

117
00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:46.239
I know.

118
00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:50.160
(knocks on glass)

119
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.953
(window whines)

120
00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:54.456
(phone bleeps)

121
00:06:58.543 --> 00:07:01.463
- Do you really think he'd
run off with someone else?

122
00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:05.050
(Susan chuckles)

123
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.721
- We went out to dinner once
and um. this fan of his.

124
00:07:09.721 --> 00:07:14.726
some fan. she was old enough.
I mean. she was Olivia's age.

125
00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:17.103
The way they talked
to each other.

126
00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:18.813
- Mom. you have no--
(knocks)

127
00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:21.816
(suspenseful music)

128
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:26.738
- (sighs) Okay.

129
00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:29.949
(knocks)

130
00:07:31.743 --> 00:07:34.371
(door creaks)

131
00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:57.352
Thank you so much. sweetie.
you remember Olivia?

132
00:07:58.603 --> 00:07:59.604
- Thank you.

133
00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:03.483
(solemn piano music)

134
00:08:06.945 --> 00:08:09.489
(inhales sharply)

135
00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:14.244
- They used the wrong shade
on his face. it's too dark.

136
00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:16.871
It's so sweet of you to come.
- I'm so sorry.

137
00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:19.332
- Thank you. you know Olivia?

138
00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:20.834
- Thank you for coming.

139
00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:21.835
- Thank you.

140
00:08:24.254 --> 00:08:27.090
I can't bare to talk
to anyone else. I...

141
00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:28.800
- Why don't you get some air?

142
00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:33.263
- Because I have
to be a good host.

143
00:08:33.263 --> 00:08:36.015
Olivia. people came all this
way to show their respects.

144
00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:38.727
- Okay.

145
00:08:41.062 --> 00:08:43.606
(door slams)

146
00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:58.830
- Who is that. Olivia. do
you know. standing there?

147
00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:02.417
- Nope. I don't know her.

148
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:06.546
- (scoffs) Were we not just
talking about bad makeup?

149
00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:11.426
Caked on like a French hooker.

150
00:09:12.677 --> 00:09:13.553
- Don't do this.

151
00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:15.889
- It's offensive.

152
00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:21.352
Presenting herself that
way at my husband's wake.

153
00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:24.731
(woman sobs)

154
00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:30.070
She was sleeping with him.

155
00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:34.199
- I can't believe you'd
bring that up again.

156
00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:36.034
- She ignored us completely.

157
00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:40.079
(door slams)

158
00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:42.665
(Olivia scoffs)

159
00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:48.588
- He would never do that to us.

160
00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:51.925
- You didn't know
him like I did.

161
00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:56.930
He became disinterested in
me after I gave birth to you.

162
00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:19.077
(phone vibrates)

163
00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:26.042
(woman sobs)

164
00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:37.679
- Who shall separate us
from the love of Christ?

165
00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:39.222
Shall tribulation?

166
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:44.435
Or persecution or famine?
(camera snaps)

167
00:10:44.435 --> 00:10:47.272
Or nakedness or peril or sword?

168
00:10:48.857 --> 00:10:52.694
As it is written for thy sake.
we are killed all day long.

169
00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:54.654
We are accounted as
sheep for the slaughter.

170
00:10:57.198 --> 00:11:01.828
Nay. in all these things.
we are more than conquerors.

171
00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:03.830
through him that loved us.

172
00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:07.709
For I am convinced that
neither death. nor life.

173
00:11:09.043 --> 00:11:10.795
nor angels. nor demons.

174
00:11:12.547 --> 00:11:15.842
nor powers. nor things present.
nor things things to come.

175
00:11:17.176 --> 00:11:20.763
nor height. nor depth.
nor any other creature

176
00:11:20.763 --> 00:11:23.641
shall be able to separate
us from the love of God.

177
00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:27.228
which is in Christ.
Jesus. our Lord.

178
00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:29.981
Amen.

179
00:11:29.981 --> 00:11:33.067
("Moonlight Sonata")

180
00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:45.371
- Your father was such an
extraordinary man. Olivia.

181
00:11:45.371 --> 00:11:50.335
He touched so many
others with his work.

182
00:11:51.878 --> 00:11:54.672
I'll always remember him
at the children's hospital.

183
00:11:54.672 --> 00:11:55.882
reading from his books.

184
00:11:57.759 --> 00:11:58.843
- (chuckles) Yeah. me too.

185
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.555
- How long is it you stay home?

186
00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:04.682
- I'm actually leaving tomorrow.

187
00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:09.604
I'm having the baby in New
York and I'm due in two days.

188
00:12:09.604 --> 00:12:10.980
- Two days?

189
00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.357
Gosh. that soon.

190
00:12:13.608 --> 00:12:15.485
(Olivia chuckles)

191
00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:17.737
Well. congratulations.

192
00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:19.989
A baby is a blessing from God.

193
00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:21.074
- So I've heard.

194
00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:26.871
- You know. I don't mean
to be presumptuous. but.

195
00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:28.414
as you may or may not know.

196
00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:31.876
your father was a big
contributor with our church.

197
00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:35.380
We'd be fortunate.
fortunate and grateful.

198
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.881
if that were to continue.

199
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.967
- I'll talk to my mother.

200
00:12:40.385 --> 00:12:42.595
- She stopped coming
a few years ago.

201
00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.520
- She didn't say.

202
00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.107
- I know the relationship
that Stanley had with Christ.

203
00:12:55.566 --> 00:12:57.610
It's what he would've wanted.

204
00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.696
- Then I'm sure it'll
be in the will. Father.

205
00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:01.823
Thank you for the
service. it was beautiful.

206
00:13:12.834 --> 00:13:14.627
- I'm surprised you
haven't poured yourself

207
00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:15.628
a glass of wine yet.

208
00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:18.256
- Don't worry. I
won't embarrass you.

209
00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:21.217
- What did the priest want?

210
00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:23.344
- Tried to shake
me down for money.

211
00:13:23.344 --> 00:13:25.680
Said Dad always
made contributions.

212
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.266
- Why didn't he ask me?

213
00:13:28.266 --> 00:13:29.892
- [Olivia] He said you don't
go to the church anymore.

214
00:13:29.892 --> 00:13:30.810
- No. I do not.

215
00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:33.813
Did he tell you why?

216
00:13:35.898 --> 00:13:36.899
- Didn't ask.

217
00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:38.818
- Well...

218
00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:42.196
(footsteps clack)

219
00:13:42.196 --> 00:13:45.074
You know. I still care
about all of these people.

220
00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:50.163
even if they want nothing
to do with me. (chuckles)

221
00:13:51.372 --> 00:13:52.832
- Everyone's here
to support you. Mom.

222
00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:56.544
- It's for your
father. not for me.

223
00:13:56.544 --> 00:13:58.921
- Funerals are for the
living. not the dead.

224
00:13:59.922 --> 00:14:01.007
(somber orchestral music)

225
00:14:01.007 --> 00:14:03.342
- That is the silliest
thing I've ever heard.

226
00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:36.042
(Olivia chuckles)

227
00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:49.847
(phone vibrates)

228
00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:53.810
(Olivia sighs)

229
00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:06.072
(car approaches)

230
00:15:06.072 --> 00:15:09.075
(suspenseful music)

231
00:15:15.414 --> 00:15:18.042
(engine hums)

232
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.462
(camera snaps)

233
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.342
(engine roars)

234
00:15:29.137 --> 00:15:31.389
(distant boat horn blows)
(gulls squawk)

235
00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:36.394
(background chatter)
(distant music)

236
00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:39.397
- The town's getting
zoning in place

237
00:15:39.397 --> 00:15:41.607
to put a statue up near
the ferry terminal.

238
00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:44.402
You should be proud.

239
00:15:51.075 --> 00:15:54.162
- Listen. the last
time I talked to him.

240
00:15:54.162 --> 00:15:55.580
our conversation was cut short.

241
00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:01.586
- Yeah. I saw that
in your statement.

242
00:16:01.586 --> 00:16:04.380
Listen. his death was
ruled a heart attack.

243
00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.674
There was no evidence
of foul play.

244
00:16:06.674 --> 00:16:08.467
- It's just that it...

245
00:16:09.427 --> 00:16:10.511
It seems strange.

246
00:16:12.054 --> 00:16:15.683
- We both know how awful cell
service is on this island.

247
00:16:15.683 --> 00:16:16.475
Right?

248
00:16:17.351 --> 00:16:18.978
- [Man] (chuckles) Hey. Chief!

249
00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:20.563
Good to see ya here.

250
00:16:20.563 --> 00:16:21.731
- Kellen.

251
00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:23.399
- Miss Prescott.

252
00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:26.402
I just wanna say. I'm so sorry.

253
00:16:26.402 --> 00:16:28.362
Anyone that goes through
something like that. but

254
00:16:28.362 --> 00:16:31.991
especially you. I mean. Stanley
was an inspiration to me.

255
00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:34.160
I grew up reading him books.

256
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.995
- Thank you.

257
00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:38.623
- What brings you to
this side of the bay?

258
00:16:38.623 --> 00:16:39.749
- Farmers' market.

259
00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:48.549
- Well. thank you. Kellen.

260
00:16:48.549 --> 00:16:49.342
- Yeah.

261
00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:51.844
All right.

262
00:16:51.844 --> 00:16:53.763
It's good seeing you.
nice to meet you.

263
00:16:57.016 --> 00:16:59.268
(bell rings)

264
00:17:01.729 --> 00:17:04.774
- I imagine this kind of thing
happens a lot these days.

265
00:17:04.774 --> 00:17:06.150
- Yeah.

266
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:08.611
I like hearing from
people who admired him.

267
00:17:10.154 --> 00:17:10.947
It's nice.

268
00:17:20.206 --> 00:17:22.583
(door creaks)

269
00:17:27.213 --> 00:17:29.840
(clock ticks)

270
00:17:36.347 --> 00:17:37.223
Mom. are you okay?

271
00:17:40.977 --> 00:17:41.727
- Olivia...

272
00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:45.523
(clears throat)

273
00:17:45.523 --> 00:17:47.608
How did the funeral
pictures turn out?

274
00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:52.780
- I don't know. I haven't
really gone through them.

275
00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.865
- I was thinking about
what you said yesterday.

276
00:17:54.865 --> 00:17:57.368
about Father James shaking
you down for money.

277
00:18:00.579 --> 00:18:04.583
What an awful thing to say.
with everything he's done.

278
00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:08.796
- Okay?

279
00:18:08.796 --> 00:18:11.299
- I'm gonna make a
sizeable donation to them.

280
00:18:11.299 --> 00:18:12.758
after we sell the sailboat.

281
00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:17.305
How much should we give
them. do you think?

282
00:18:18.723 --> 00:18:20.266
- I don't know.

283
00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:22.810
How much is the sailboat worth?

284
00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:24.312
- Ah.

285
00:18:24.312 --> 00:18:26.439
(distant boat horn blows)

286
00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:27.440
I have no idea.

287
00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:31.986
We've got all these
things now. Olivia.

288
00:18:31.986 --> 00:18:35.948
and I don't know how or who...

289
00:18:38.492 --> 00:18:40.411
Who'll have all
that he's left to...

290
00:18:44.206 --> 00:18:45.916
What do you want for dinner?

291
00:18:50.463 --> 00:18:51.589
Wow.

292
00:18:51.589 --> 00:18:52.590
That was fast.

293
00:18:54.008 --> 00:18:56.010
Your father's barely
cold in the ground.

294
00:18:57.303 --> 00:19:01.015
- I'm due any day. and I'm
having the baby in New York.

295
00:19:01.015 --> 00:19:02.641
- Yes. well. you've
cut your mother

296
00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:04.935
completely out of that
process. haven't you?

297
00:19:04.935 --> 00:19:07.480
- God. Mom. not
everything is about you.

298
00:19:09.774 --> 00:19:11.901
(somber orchestral music)

299
00:19:11.901 --> 00:19:13.277
- I am all alone.

300
00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.654
I'm all alone now.

301
00:19:21.369 --> 00:19:24.121
(Olivia sighs)

302
00:19:32.254 --> 00:19:34.131
- I'm taking Dad's car.

303
00:19:34.131 --> 00:19:36.926
(footsteps clack)

304
00:19:39.303 --> 00:19:41.931
(clock ticks)

305
00:20:19.802 --> 00:20:22.471
(water splashes)

306
00:20:28.436 --> 00:20:31.814
(distant boat horn blows)

307
00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:37.945
(background chatter)
(faint string music)

308
00:20:39.363 --> 00:20:40.865
- Good evening. miss.

309
00:20:40.865 --> 00:20:43.826
Can I grab you a
sparkling water to start?

310
00:20:43.826 --> 00:20:45.995
- Actually. could I
grab a glass of Malbec?

311
00:20:47.663 --> 00:20:48.414
- Yeah. sure.

312
00:20:57.715 --> 00:20:58.466
- Hi!

313
00:20:59.842 --> 00:21:01.135
Kellen.

314
00:21:01.135 --> 00:21:02.595
We met earlier at
the coffee shop.

315
00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:05.764
- Farmers' market?

316
00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:09.351
- Yeah. (chuckles) yeah.
- Right. (chuckles)

317
00:21:09.351 --> 00:21:10.311
- Small world.

318
00:21:12.271 --> 00:21:14.773
You know. the ferry
doesn't run after seven.

319
00:21:14.773 --> 00:21:16.609
You're about to be
stuck on the mainland.

320
00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.153
Mind if I sit?

321
00:21:23.073 --> 00:21:25.784
- [Waiter] We have a
Malbec for the lady.

322
00:21:25.784 --> 00:21:28.621
And will you be joining us
this evening as well. sir?

323
00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:29.413
- Um...

324
00:21:32.708 --> 00:21:34.502
- [Waiter] All right.
how about a drink?

325
00:21:34.502 --> 00:21:36.253
- I'll have what she's havin'.

326
00:21:36.253 --> 00:21:39.757
And an order of the ricotta
and braised leek crostini.

327
00:21:39.757 --> 00:21:40.591
- [Waiter] Perfect.

328
00:21:40.591 --> 00:21:41.509
- How's that sound?

329
00:21:44.053 --> 00:21:46.305
(Olivia chuckles)

330
00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:49.058
Look at you. you
are just glowing.

331
00:21:50.726 --> 00:21:52.061
(chuckles)

332
00:21:52.061 --> 00:21:53.521
And you have a lovely smile.

333
00:21:56.607 --> 00:21:58.734
God. I'm making it awkward.
all right. tell me.

334
00:21:58.734 --> 00:22:01.237
You're not going back to the
island. where are you goin'?

335
00:22:02.071 --> 00:22:04.031
- I live in New York.

336
00:22:04.031 --> 00:22:05.658
- New York?
- Mm-hm.

337
00:22:05.658 --> 00:22:07.868
- I've never been
there. how is it?

338
00:22:07.868 --> 00:22:11.539
Do you love it?
- It's. uh. you know.

339
00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:13.791
- No. I don't know.
(chuckles) what else?

340
00:22:15.834 --> 00:22:19.088
- I don't know. it's a big city.

341
00:22:20.422 --> 00:22:25.135
Lots of buildings
and subways and...

342
00:22:25.135 --> 00:22:26.428
- You are so descriptive.

343
00:22:26.428 --> 00:22:29.390
(both laugh)

344
00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:31.267
- A Malbec for you.
- Awesome.

345
00:22:31.267 --> 00:22:33.352
- And a menu.
- Thank you.

346
00:22:36.689 --> 00:22:37.982
Well. what now?

347
00:22:37.982 --> 00:22:38.899
How about a toast?

348
00:22:41.527 --> 00:22:42.820
To men like your father.

349
00:22:44.405 --> 00:22:47.866
who've changed the lives of so
many people around the world.

350
00:22:49.285 --> 00:22:50.035
Including me.

351
00:22:54.456 --> 00:22:59.420
Cheers.
(glasses clink)

352
00:23:03.674 --> 00:23:05.467
- Thank you for saying that.

353
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:09.597
- Well. it should be said.

354
00:23:11.015 --> 00:23:12.433
You're gonna have to
forgive me when I say

355
00:23:12.433 --> 00:23:14.059
I really envy you.

356
00:23:14.059 --> 00:23:16.770
You're about to start
this incredible journey.

357
00:23:18.272 --> 00:23:20.149
There's something about
being a parent I've noticed.

358
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:22.234
especially in mothers.

359
00:23:22.234 --> 00:23:25.446
They possess this
unconditional love.

360
00:23:25.446 --> 00:23:27.740
It's really incredible to see.

361
00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:31.785
I hope to one day
have that for someone.

362
00:23:34.204 --> 00:23:36.624
I'd do anything to
be in your position.

363
00:23:36.624 --> 00:23:37.625
To be a...

364
00:23:39.168 --> 00:23:39.918
Father.

365
00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:47.509
- If you'll just excuse me.

366
00:23:47.509 --> 00:23:49.595
I'm gonna use the
restroom really quickly.

367
00:23:49.595 --> 00:23:53.682
- Oh. right. baby
bladder. yeah. (chuckles)

368
00:23:53.682 --> 00:23:57.436
I'll save your crostini.
(Olivia chuckles)

369
00:24:00.522 --> 00:24:03.359
(ominous tones)

370
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:07.571
(water splashes)

371
00:24:11.575 --> 00:24:14.953
(somber orchestral music)

372
00:24:21.418 --> 00:24:23.879
(Olivia sighs)

373
00:24:24.713 --> 00:24:27.508
(Olivia chuckles)

374
00:24:31.553 --> 00:24:32.596
(Olivia giggles)

375
00:24:32.596 --> 00:24:36.642
- You're crazy.
that's funny. (laughs)

376
00:24:36.642 --> 00:24:38.644
I gotta say. you have
lived a full life.

377
00:24:40.312 --> 00:24:41.647
(chuckles)

378
00:24:41.647 --> 00:24:43.440
And now you're
gonna be a mother.

379
00:24:45.192 --> 00:24:46.527
- Yeah.

380
00:24:46.527 --> 00:24:48.570
- You're gonna be a great one.
(Olivia chuckles)

381
00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:51.156
And your daughter is gonna
get the best of everything.

382
00:24:51.156 --> 00:24:51.907
You know?

383
00:24:52.741 --> 00:24:54.618
Experiences and schools.

384
00:24:54.618 --> 00:24:56.662
and she's gonna
travel the world and--

385
00:24:56.662 --> 00:24:58.706
- Not end up in Maine.

386
00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.292
- Yeah. that's what I was
trying to say! (chuckles)

387
00:25:02.292 --> 00:25:04.670
- Oh. it's not a bad place
to come back to. though.

388
00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:05.713
Yeah.

389
00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:09.133
- Sure.

390
00:25:10.134 --> 00:25:12.177
And she will

391
00:25:13.637 --> 00:25:15.389
go back to

392
00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.683
the city.

393
00:25:19.435 --> 00:25:20.227
As her...

394
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:24.356
Gosh. it's strange
to think about.

395
00:25:25.566 --> 00:25:28.569
Which. who knows. well.
it's not what you had.

396
00:25:28.569 --> 00:25:29.737
(Olivia chuckles)

397
00:25:29.737 --> 00:25:30.654
And maybe better.

398
00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:34.158
- Yeah.

399
00:25:36.535 --> 00:25:37.619
What I had.

400
00:25:43.876 --> 00:25:48.088
I am bringing a baby
into this world...

401
00:25:52.509 --> 00:25:56.346
And I don't wanna end up
like my mom. (chuckles)

402
00:26:01.935 --> 00:26:02.853
And Greg.

403
00:26:05.898 --> 00:26:09.735
Greg is great. you know.
he's a really good guy

404
00:26:09.735 --> 00:26:11.570
and he's gonna be a good dad.

405
00:26:14.573 --> 00:26:17.576
But. you know. it would just
crush me if I broke him.

406
00:26:20.454 --> 00:26:21.872
Like my mom broke my dad.

407
00:26:30.297 --> 00:26:33.717
There's just a lot
of unhappiness there.

408
00:26:39.932 --> 00:26:42.851
That's the first time I've
ever said that out loud.

409
00:26:42.851 --> 00:26:46.855
- Well. it takes a lot
of strength to say that.

410
00:26:46.855 --> 00:26:50.609
I've always believed that
strength is something that...

411
00:26:50.609 --> 00:26:55.614
(heartbeat thuds)
(muffled chatter)

412
00:26:58.158 --> 00:27:03.080
(Olivia breaths heavily)
(tense music)

413
00:27:03.831 --> 00:27:04.623
You okay?

414
00:27:05.707 --> 00:27:06.750
- Yeah.

415
00:27:08.961 --> 00:27:10.212
Oh. Jesus.

416
00:27:10.212 --> 00:27:12.673
- You know. the Lord
cries when you say that.

417
00:27:12.673 --> 00:27:13.841
(cutlery clinks)

418
00:27:13.841 --> 00:27:16.051
Oh. um. hey. can we get a check?

419
00:27:17.928 --> 00:27:19.388
It's okay.

420
00:27:19.388 --> 00:27:20.681
- [Manager] Is everything
okay here. sir?

421
00:27:20.681 --> 00:27:22.808
- Yeah. everything's
just fine. thank you.

422
00:27:22.808 --> 00:27:24.142
- [Manager] How much
did she have to drink?

423
00:27:24.142 --> 00:27:25.602
- She had one glass of wine.
- One glass?

424
00:27:26.854 --> 00:27:28.897
- All right. just
relax. come on. honey.

425
00:27:28.897 --> 00:27:30.357
- Sir.
- Oh. right.

426
00:27:30.357 --> 00:27:31.316
This should take
care of everything.

427
00:27:31.316 --> 00:27:33.610
I think she's going into labor.

428
00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:34.528
- Labor?

429
00:27:34.528 --> 00:27:35.863
Should we call an ambulance?

430
00:27:35.863 --> 00:27:37.281
- [Keller] No. no. no.
I have it. thank you.

431
00:27:37.281 --> 00:27:39.116
- I guess she's
going into labor.

432
00:27:39.116 --> 00:27:43.829
She's gonna have a baby!
(patrons applaud)

433
00:27:45.289 --> 00:27:47.165
- Okay. right through
here. honey. let's go.

434
00:27:47.165 --> 00:27:48.750
Shh. shh.

435
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:49.835
Sir?

436
00:27:49.835 --> 00:27:50.878
24. please. thank you.

437
00:27:50.878 --> 00:27:52.963
Okay. honey. we're
gonna get you home.

438
00:27:52.963 --> 00:27:54.590
You'll be fine.

439
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:55.883
- Is she okay?

440
00:27:55.883 --> 00:27:57.342
- Yeah. a little pregnancy
sickness. thank you.

441
00:27:59.678 --> 00:28:00.679
That's us.

442
00:28:02.598 --> 00:28:03.682
- Oh. no.
- Come on.

443
00:28:05.309 --> 00:28:06.476
Right in there. honey.

444
00:28:07.853 --> 00:28:09.021
All right. watch your head.

445
00:28:11.356 --> 00:28:13.358
It's gonna be just fine.

446
00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:23.785
(tires screech)
(engine roars)

447
00:28:37.883 --> 00:28:41.053
(tire bangs and hisses)

448
00:28:47.809 --> 00:28:48.602
No.

449
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:56.485
(door creaks)
(dark orchestral music)

450
00:28:56.985 --> 00:28:59.988
(keys clink)

451
00:28:59.988 --> 00:29:02.532
(door creaks)

452
00:29:07.496 --> 00:29:09.623
(grunts)

453
00:29:14.169 --> 00:29:17.881
(car approaches)

454
00:29:17.881 --> 00:29:20.842
(siren wails)

455
00:29:20.842 --> 00:29:25.389
(door clicks)
(hushed chatter)

456
00:29:25.389 --> 00:29:27.933
- [Radio] Copy that. 10-four.

457
00:29:27.933 --> 00:29:29.476
- [Officer] How's
it going over there?

458
00:29:29.476 --> 00:29:30.394
- It's going good.

459
00:29:32.562 --> 00:29:34.189
(bolt clunks)

460
00:29:34.189 --> 00:29:36.566
- You okay?
(suspenseful music)

461
00:29:36.566 --> 00:29:41.321
- Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.
it's just. you know.

462
00:29:41.321 --> 00:29:42.906
- [Officer] You had
anything to drink tonight?

463
00:29:42.906 --> 00:29:45.283
(tools clang)

464
00:29:47.244 --> 00:29:50.539
(Kellen sighs)

465
00:29:50.539 --> 00:29:51.289
- No. sir.

466
00:30:05.637 --> 00:30:06.471
- Who's this now?

467
00:30:07.597 --> 00:30:08.932
- I was just taking her home.

468
00:30:10.183 --> 00:30:13.812
We were having supper
at the restaurant.

469
00:30:13.812 --> 00:30:15.605
She fell asleep. she's pregnant.

470
00:30:17.024 --> 00:30:18.525
- She's a friend of yours?

471
00:30:18.525 --> 00:30:20.068
- Yes. sir. family friend.

472
00:30:21.862 --> 00:30:23.572
- What restaurant?

473
00:30:23.572 --> 00:30:24.614
- [Kellen] What's that?

474
00:30:25.907 --> 00:30:26.867
- What restaurant?

475
00:30:27.826 --> 00:30:30.328
- Oh. de Lucio's. de Lucio's.

476
00:30:33.915 --> 00:30:36.084
- They make a mad chicken parm.

477
00:30:36.084 --> 00:30:38.211
- Yeah. yeah. I haven't
had anything there

478
00:30:38.211 --> 00:30:41.173
that I didn't like.
actually. (chuckles)

479
00:30:42.924 --> 00:30:44.926
- Hey. you know. I got
a friend over there.

480
00:30:44.926 --> 00:30:45.927
Steve.

481
00:30:46.887 --> 00:30:48.430
- Yeah. Steve. yeah. oh man.

482
00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:50.974
He makes a Manhattan out of
this world. I'm tellin' ya.

483
00:30:52.976 --> 00:30:54.853
Not that I had one
tonight. (chuckles)

484
00:30:54.853 --> 00:30:57.981
(officer chuckles)

485
00:31:00.734 --> 00:31:03.737
- Hey. you mind
if I wake her up?

486
00:31:03.737 --> 00:31:04.613
- No. I don't mind.

487
00:31:04.613 --> 00:31:05.405
Sure. go ahead.

488
00:31:07.657 --> 00:31:10.368
She might. though. (chuckles)

489
00:31:13.038 --> 00:31:15.332
- (grunts) I'll
let the lady sleep.

490
00:31:16.374 --> 00:31:18.085
Save you some trouble. right?

491
00:31:18.085 --> 00:31:20.087
- Oh. appreciate it.

492
00:31:20.087 --> 00:31:21.963
(officer chuckles)

493
00:31:21.963 --> 00:31:23.965
- All right. you
got it from here?

494
00:31:23.965 --> 00:31:25.342
- Yeah.

495
00:31:25.342 --> 00:31:26.134
I think so.

496
00:31:27.636 --> 00:31:30.138
- [Officer] All right. I'll
wait over here till you're done.

497
00:31:30.138 --> 00:31:32.516
- Appreciate it. thank you.

498
00:31:32.516 --> 00:31:35.102
- You have a good night now.
- You too. officer.

499
00:31:38.271 --> 00:31:39.606
(door thuds)

500
00:31:39.606 --> 00:31:42.192
(engine starts)

501
00:31:44.945 --> 00:31:48.073
(dark orchestral music)

502
00:33:23.293 --> 00:33:28.298
(door slams)
(bulb crackles)

503
00:33:30.217 --> 00:33:32.219
(sighs)

504
00:33:33.261 --> 00:33:35.388
(laughs)

505
00:33:42.771 --> 00:33:44.773
(sighs)

506
00:34:02.999 --> 00:34:05.252
(wind blows)

507
00:34:07.212 --> 00:34:10.840
(muffled classical music)

508
00:34:30.652 --> 00:34:32.070
How you feelin'?

509
00:34:42.122 --> 00:34:44.666
There's a glass of
water next to ya.

510
00:34:49.796 --> 00:34:51.047
- What happened?

511
00:34:52.299 --> 00:34:54.175
- You got sick.

512
00:34:54.175 --> 00:34:55.176
At the restaurant?

513
00:34:58.054 --> 00:34:58.888
- Sick?

514
00:34:58.888 --> 00:35:01.141
- Yeah.
(distant clang)

515
00:35:02.684 --> 00:35:06.187
Oh. that's my mother.
(distant scraping)

516
00:35:07.522 --> 00:35:10.275
I would've taken you home but
I didn't know where you lived.

517
00:35:11.276 --> 00:35:12.360
You couldn't tell me.

518
00:35:16.656 --> 00:35:19.200
- I'm sorry. I don't
remember what happened.

519
00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:22.787
- Tell ya what. we'll talk
everything over breakfast.

520
00:35:24.122 --> 00:35:25.081
- Where's my purse?

521
00:35:26.207 --> 00:35:27.709
- [Kellen] Let's talk first.

522
00:35:29.127 --> 00:35:29.919
- I have to go.

523
00:35:32.047 --> 00:35:33.381
(Kellen sniffs)

524
00:35:33.381 --> 00:35:34.174
- Mm!

525
00:35:35.675 --> 00:35:37.344
You smell that?

526
00:35:37.344 --> 00:35:42.349
(eggs sizzle)
(spatula scrapes)

527
00:35:49.481 --> 00:35:50.231
- Not there.

528
00:35:55.653 --> 00:35:58.323
(spatula scrapes)

529
00:35:58.323 --> 00:35:59.532
Not there. either.

530
00:35:59.532 --> 00:36:00.450
Back to the window.

531
00:36:08.333 --> 00:36:10.877
(spatula scrapes)

532
00:36:10.877 --> 00:36:11.878
- Thank you.

533
00:36:13.713 --> 00:36:15.090
- Uh. Regina?

534
00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:16.966
(pan thuds)

535
00:36:16.966 --> 00:36:17.759
- What?

536
00:36:18.968 --> 00:36:20.261
- Olivia said thank you.

537
00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:22.847
- Yeah. I heard her.

538
00:36:25.475 --> 00:36:27.352
(door creaks)

539
00:36:27.352 --> 00:36:28.687
- I apologize.

540
00:36:31.064 --> 00:36:32.732
- [Boy] Paper's on time.

541
00:36:32.732 --> 00:36:34.109
- Charlie. this is Olivia.

542
00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:39.364
- That chair's always empty.

543
00:36:39.364 --> 00:36:40.365
- [Kellen] It's okay. Charlie.

544
00:36:40.365 --> 00:36:41.991
She's gonna be joining
us for breakfast.

545
00:36:54.337 --> 00:36:56.714
(sighs)

546
00:36:56.714 --> 00:36:58.925
- Is she your friend?

547
00:37:00.343 --> 00:37:01.636
- She is our friend.

548
00:37:08.435 --> 00:37:11.646
- Well. we know one thing.
you didn't get her pregnant.

549
00:37:11.646 --> 00:37:14.899
(tense orchestral music)

550
00:37:14.899 --> 00:37:16.776
- That's not appropriate.

551
00:37:22.574 --> 00:37:25.785
- (groans) I'm sorry.

552
00:37:31.458 --> 00:37:32.750
- That's okay.

553
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:35.044
(chuckles)

554
00:37:36.838 --> 00:37:38.798
(Regina pants)

555
00:37:38.798 --> 00:37:41.134
(chuckles)

556
00:37:43.052 --> 00:37:43.845
Let's pray.

557
00:37:48.057 --> 00:37:49.309
Dear Heavenly Father.

558
00:37:49.309 --> 00:37:50.310
- Why have you
been following me?

559
00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:56.483
(Kellen sighs)

560
00:37:59.694 --> 00:38:03.323
- I haven't been completely
honest with you and I apologize.

561
00:38:03.323 --> 00:38:06.201
That is to say. (chuckles)

562
00:38:06.993 --> 00:38:08.328
I knew your father.

563
00:38:10.788 --> 00:38:12.123
Regina knew your father.

564
00:38:14.542 --> 00:38:18.254
Charlie is your father's son.

565
00:38:25.386 --> 00:38:27.472
- I swear to God if you talk--
- Please.

566
00:38:27.472 --> 00:38:29.516
Do not use the Lord's name
in vain in this house.

567
00:38:29.516 --> 00:38:30.308
- Jesus. okay. I'm leaving.

568
00:38:30.308 --> 00:38:32.393
- Damn it. sit!

569
00:38:32.393 --> 00:38:33.186
Now!

570
00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:35.855
Sit.

571
00:38:35.855 --> 00:38:36.648
Now.

572
00:38:45.281 --> 00:38:46.074
I'm so sorry.

573
00:38:47.575 --> 00:38:49.661
Listen. I know this
is hard to hear.

574
00:38:51.079 --> 00:38:52.914
Especially that Stanley's
been paying us off

575
00:38:52.914 --> 00:38:54.165
to keep this quiet.

576
00:38:55.708 --> 00:38:58.127
As you can see. it
hasn't been much.

577
00:38:58.127 --> 00:39:01.172
Though we're humble servants
of God. we don't need much.

578
00:39:01.172 --> 00:39:02.340
Do we?

579
00:39:04.342 --> 00:39:06.427
But the fact remains. Charlie.

580
00:39:07.887 --> 00:39:10.348
has a legal right to
what's been left for you.

581
00:39:10.348 --> 00:39:12.850
He is Stanley's flesh and blood.

582
00:39:19.357 --> 00:39:20.400
- Bullshit.

583
00:39:24.112 --> 00:39:25.947
- Okay. well. I'd
say the same thing.

584
00:39:25.947 --> 00:39:28.491
if I was sittin' where
you're sittin' but.

585
00:39:28.491 --> 00:39:32.537
imagine what the headlines
would say. if we went to court.

586
00:39:36.874 --> 00:39:38.376
I didn't wanna do that.
I came to you first.

587
00:39:38.376 --> 00:39:42.463
because I think that you
deserve the courtesy of choosing

588
00:39:42.463 --> 00:39:45.383
to do what's right. and...

589
00:39:47.427 --> 00:39:50.763
The opportunity to meet
your brother. face to face.

590
00:40:07.905 --> 00:40:09.991
One way or another.

591
00:40:09.991 --> 00:40:11.743
you're gonna give me
half of that inheritance.

592
00:40:11.743 --> 00:40:14.412
so I can give Charlie
the life he deserves.

593
00:40:16.748 --> 00:40:18.625
(thud)

594
00:40:21.294 --> 00:40:23.546
(door slams)

595
00:40:26.007 --> 00:40:26.799
Charlie?

596
00:40:28.635 --> 00:40:30.094
Charlie.

597
00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:32.722
- I told him it was a bad
idea to bring you here.

598
00:40:32.722 --> 00:40:34.932
(chuckles)

599
00:40:34.932 --> 00:40:36.434
Soon you'll find
out what it's like

600
00:40:36.434 --> 00:40:38.603
to bring a child into
this world alone.

601
00:40:40.521 --> 00:40:44.150
The only difference is.
you'll be able to afford it.

602
00:41:10.134 --> 00:41:14.472
- I'm truly sorry about the
pain of your father's betrayal.

603
00:41:14.472 --> 00:41:17.016
I pray God gives you the
strength to do what's right.

604
00:41:20.937 --> 00:41:25.149
Give place unto wrath.
vengeance is mine to repay.

605
00:41:33.616 --> 00:41:34.409
Olivia?

606
00:41:36.661 --> 00:41:40.498
Your father was a monster.

607
00:41:41.666 --> 00:41:43.543
But he's given you
an incredible gift.

608
00:41:44.711 --> 00:41:45.503
This opportunity.

609
00:42:07.108 --> 00:42:09.652
- I was 15 when I had Kellen.

610
00:42:12.697 --> 00:42:13.740
Did my best.

611
00:42:23.499 --> 00:42:26.169
(water splashes)

612
00:42:28.129 --> 00:42:29.922
- Any bruises?
- No.

613
00:42:29.922 --> 00:42:33.634
And I checked the baby's
heart rate. it's fine.

614
00:42:33.634 --> 00:42:36.262
- [Chief] Your ordered
a blood and urine test?

615
00:42:36.262 --> 00:42:37.638
- Of course.
- Okay.

616
00:42:39.599 --> 00:42:40.683
Listen. Olivia. I'm sorry.

617
00:42:40.683 --> 00:42:43.519
I gotta run through
this one more time.

618
00:42:43.519 --> 00:42:45.605
When you woke up. you
were fully clothed?

619
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:47.982
- Yes.

620
00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:50.485
- [Chief] And then
what happened?

621
00:42:52.361 --> 00:42:54.781
- And then his mom
made me breakfast.

622
00:42:54.781 --> 00:42:56.407
- Regina?
- Yes. Regina.

623
00:42:59.327 --> 00:43:00.745
- Why didn't you leave then?

624
00:43:02.205 --> 00:43:04.582
- Because he didn't give
me back my purse yet.

625
00:43:06.751 --> 00:43:08.044
- And then what?

626
00:43:08.044 --> 00:43:09.921
- [Olivia] And then
he threatened me.

627
00:43:10.755 --> 00:43:11.798
- How so?

628
00:43:12.924 --> 00:43:16.385
- (sighs) He said "vengeance
is mine to repay."

629
00:43:17.804 --> 00:43:19.222
I think it's from the Bible.

630
00:43:19.222 --> 00:43:21.641
He wouldn't stop
talking about it.

631
00:43:21.641 --> 00:43:24.769
- Why would he say
that. "vengeance."
"vengeance is mine?"

632
00:43:31.484 --> 00:43:32.276
- I don't know.

633
00:43:36.197 --> 00:43:36.989
- Hm.

634
00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:43.621
(sighs)

635
00:43:43.621 --> 00:43:45.623
Okay. look. I gotta be honest.

636
00:43:45.623 --> 00:43:47.667
I don't have enough to
charge him with anything.

637
00:43:50.837 --> 00:43:53.506
(sighs)

638
00:43:53.506 --> 00:43:57.677
I'll do what I can to make
sure he leaves you alone.

639
00:44:01.722 --> 00:44:03.474
(door slams)

640
00:44:03.474 --> 00:44:04.642
(lock clicks)

641
00:44:04.642 --> 00:44:05.685
- Olivia?

642
00:44:06.936 --> 00:44:08.604
What're you doing here?

643
00:44:08.604 --> 00:44:10.565
I thought you were going to
New York to have your baby?

644
00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:17.697
Am I to simply expect
to see you whirling in

645
00:44:17.697 --> 00:44:21.742
and out of my house
whenever you feel like it?

646
00:44:21.742 --> 00:44:25.663
You know. I deserve some respect
and a little consideration.

647
00:44:25.663 --> 00:44:27.456
I have just lost my husband.

648
00:44:27.456 --> 00:44:30.793
You have always been the most
competitive. manipulative.

649
00:44:30.793 --> 00:44:34.714
you pitted your father and me
against each other for years.

650
00:44:34.714 --> 00:44:35.715
- You did that.

651
00:44:35.715 --> 00:44:37.008
That was you. Mom.

652
00:44:38.551 --> 00:44:41.721
God. you even blame me
for Dad cheating on you.

653
00:44:41.721 --> 00:44:44.599
- Your father hated
me. because of you.

654
00:44:45.975 --> 00:44:47.435
- No. he didn't.

655
00:44:47.435 --> 00:44:50.479
- Yes. he did. because
he wanted a son.

656
00:44:50.479 --> 00:44:52.773
And after you were born.
I couldn't give him one.

657
00:44:56.903 --> 00:44:59.864
- Then why'd you stay?
- Because it was my duty.

658
00:44:59.864 --> 00:45:01.866
I sacrificed everything for you.

659
00:45:01.866 --> 00:45:05.119
- Well. I didn't ask you to
do that. so you don't get

660
00:45:05.119 --> 00:45:07.705
to hold that over my head
for the rest of my life.

661
00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:17.924
- When you have your child.

662
00:45:17.924 --> 00:45:19.967
then you will know

663
00:45:19.967 --> 00:45:22.762
how I feel being your mother.

664
00:45:24.847 --> 00:45:27.683
(Olivia scoffs)

665
00:45:29.852 --> 00:45:31.228
(distant dog barks)

666
00:45:31.228 --> 00:45:34.523
(lobster shell cracks)

667
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:41.572
(lobster meat squelches)

668
00:45:47.662 --> 00:45:48.454
(Kellen chuckles)

669
00:45:48.454 --> 00:45:49.246
- Hello. Chief.

670
00:45:50.331 --> 00:45:51.123
- Kellen.

671
00:45:56.963 --> 00:45:58.631
(clears throat)

672
00:45:58.631 --> 00:46:01.759
Thank you. Susie. and um.
a beer for the young man.

673
00:46:04.804 --> 00:46:08.140
You need to leave
Olivia Prescott alone.

674
00:46:09.934 --> 00:46:10.893
- I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

675
00:46:10.893 --> 00:46:12.979
Did I do something wrong?

676
00:46:12.979 --> 00:46:15.523
(Chief clears his throat)

677
00:46:15.523 --> 00:46:16.899
- So what happened last night?

678
00:46:19.527 --> 00:46:20.987
- Oh. I ran into her at supper.

679
00:46:22.405 --> 00:46:26.075
- You just happened
to run into her?

680
00:46:26.075 --> 00:46:27.284
(Kellen chuckles)

681
00:46:27.284 --> 00:46:29.161
- I go to de Lucia's
all the time.

682
00:46:29.161 --> 00:46:30.329
Great chicken parm.

683
00:46:31.414 --> 00:46:32.790
You know Steve. the bartender?

684
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:33.791
- Okay.

685
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:41.132
- Well. okay. so let's
get one thing clear.

686
00:46:41.132 --> 00:46:41.924
She.

687
00:46:43.009 --> 00:46:44.677
asked me.

688
00:46:44.677 --> 00:46:45.970
to join her.

689
00:46:46.929 --> 00:46:49.056
I didn't wanna be
rude. I obliged.

690
00:46:49.056 --> 00:46:50.057
She's very pleasant.

691
00:46:51.225 --> 00:46:53.519
Couple laughs. she's
really charming.

692
00:46:55.813 --> 00:46:57.314
Then she got sick.

693
00:46:58.816 --> 00:47:00.317
And I took her home.

694
00:47:01.318 --> 00:47:03.487
(lobster shell cracks)

695
00:47:03.487 --> 00:47:06.866
- She thinks you did more than
just take her home. Kellen.

696
00:47:11.037 --> 00:47:14.290
(lobster meat squelches)

697
00:47:18.085 --> 00:47:18.878
- Chief.

698
00:47:21.338 --> 00:47:23.466
What could I possibly do?

699
00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:27.720
- Old habits die hard.

700
00:47:35.144 --> 00:47:37.897
- I've paid for my sins.

701
00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:41.942
I've changed.

702
00:47:44.028 --> 00:47:46.781
- She went to go see
Dr. Baker this morning.

703
00:47:46.781 --> 00:47:47.740
They called me.

704
00:47:50.951 --> 00:47:53.579
You better pray to god those
tests come back negative.

705
00:47:55.581 --> 00:47:57.083
You understand me?

706
00:47:57.083 --> 00:48:00.544
(tense orchestral music)

707
00:48:12.765 --> 00:48:13.933
Enjoy your beer.

708
00:49:09.989 --> 00:49:11.323
(phone rings)

709
00:49:11.323 --> 00:49:12.241
- [Greg] Hi. you've
reached the law firm

710
00:49:12.241 --> 00:49:14.160
of Greg Barner and Associates.

711
00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:15.327
Please leave a message.

712
00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:26.172
(phone vibrates)

713
00:49:30.426 --> 00:49:31.468
- Hey.

714
00:49:31.468 --> 00:49:32.803
- [Greg] Hey. is it time?

715
00:49:34.847 --> 00:49:35.639
Hello?

716
00:49:37.975 --> 00:49:38.767
- No.

717
00:49:42.396 --> 00:49:43.898
- Is everything okay?

718
00:49:47.902 --> 00:49:50.196
(Olivia sighs)
I've been trying to call you.

719
00:49:52.156 --> 00:49:53.199
- I know.

720
00:49:57.786 --> 00:49:58.996
- Do you need anything?

721
00:50:03.584 --> 00:50:04.460
- No. I'm fine.

722
00:50:08.172 --> 00:50:08.964
I'm sorry.

723
00:50:14.178 --> 00:50:14.970
- [Greg] Me too.

724
00:50:18.849 --> 00:50:19.850
- Goodnight.

725
00:50:25.689 --> 00:50:28.192
(Greg sighs)

726
00:50:42.748 --> 00:50:45.084
(clock ticks)

727
00:50:45.084 --> 00:50:47.169
(knocks)

728
00:50:52.841 --> 00:50:55.594
(footsteps clack)

729
00:50:56.679 --> 00:50:57.721
- Good mornin'!

730
00:50:58.931 --> 00:51:01.225
- Good morning. can I help you?

731
00:51:01.225 --> 00:51:04.436
- Yeah. uh. so sorry to
bother you. Miss Prescott.

732
00:51:04.436 --> 00:51:07.773
We haven't actually
formally been introduced.

733
00:51:07.773 --> 00:51:09.108
but I'm a friend of Olivia's.

734
00:51:10.359 --> 00:51:11.777
- Uh-huh.

735
00:51:11.777 --> 00:51:12.778
Hello.

736
00:51:12.778 --> 00:51:14.238
- I know it's early. again.

737
00:51:14.238 --> 00:51:15.823
- Yes. it's quite early.
(Kellen laughs)

738
00:51:15.823 --> 00:51:17.783
- Again. I apologize.

739
00:51:17.783 --> 00:51:22.788
You see. there was this
misunderstandin' the other day.

740
00:51:23.455 --> 00:51:24.748
and I wanted to come by.

741
00:51:24.748 --> 00:51:26.792
and I'd love to talk
to your daughter.

742
00:51:26.792 --> 00:51:29.712
and just clear everything up.

743
00:51:34.258 --> 00:51:38.762
And those are some lovely
earrings. might I add.

744
00:51:38.762 --> 00:51:39.513
Wow.

745
00:51:40.723 --> 00:51:43.142
- Oh. thank you.
they were a gift.

746
00:51:43.142 --> 00:51:47.688
Olivia is asleep right now.
so I will tell her that--

747
00:51:47.688 --> 00:51:49.106
- Kellen.

748
00:51:49.106 --> 00:51:51.942
- Kellen. I will tell her
that Kellen stopped by.

749
00:51:51.942 --> 00:51:53.193
- Great.
- Good to see you.

750
00:51:53.193 --> 00:51:54.945
- Oh. you know
what. Miss Prescott?

751
00:51:54.945 --> 00:51:57.698
I got on the first
ferry over this mornin'.

752
00:51:57.698 --> 00:52:01.285
(laughs) It is not easy
gettin' on this island.

753
00:52:01.285 --> 00:52:03.370
- No. the ferry's
the only way. yeah.

754
00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:06.123
- Yeah. so if you wouldn't mind.

755
00:52:06.123 --> 00:52:09.460
I'd prefer to just
come inside and wait.

756
00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:13.255
I hadn't gotten in my
prayers yet this mornin'.

757
00:52:13.255 --> 00:52:15.299
and I won't be any
trouble. I assure ya.

758
00:52:17.843 --> 00:52:21.305
- I'm sorry. you wanna
come into my house to pray?

759
00:52:21.305 --> 00:52:23.891
- Yeah. I'm a member of
the Mother of Mercy Church.

760
00:52:23.891 --> 00:52:27.019
right across the bay. perhaps
you know Father James?

761
00:52:27.019 --> 00:52:28.937
- I do know Father James.

762
00:52:30.647 --> 00:52:33.233
(clears throat)

763
00:52:33.233 --> 00:52:35.235
(sighs)

764
00:52:37.071 --> 00:52:37.863
Yep.

765
00:52:40.699 --> 00:52:41.575
(lock clicks)

766
00:52:41.575 --> 00:52:43.702
(door creaks)

767
00:52:43.702 --> 00:52:45.621
- He's a mentor of mine.
- Is he now?

768
00:52:45.621 --> 00:52:47.498
Well. please. come in.

769
00:52:47.498 --> 00:52:49.500
(door creaks)

770
00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:51.794
(chuckles)

771
00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:04.390
- So sorry to hear about
Stanley. he was quite the man.

772
00:53:05.307 --> 00:53:06.308
- [Susan] Thank you.

773
00:53:10.521 --> 00:53:13.023
- I've heard this
property is breathtaking.

774
00:53:13.023 --> 00:53:16.068
but the rumors don't do
it justice. Miss Prescott.

775
00:53:17.319 --> 00:53:20.364
- Well. it was Stanley's
dream. his design.

776
00:53:20.364 --> 00:53:21.990
(clears throat)

777
00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:24.118
Feels empty without him in it.

778
00:53:24.118 --> 00:53:24.910
- Oh.

779
00:53:26.203 --> 00:53:28.622
I'm sure the Lord will find a
way to fill it with comfort.

780
00:53:34.086 --> 00:53:38.674
Yes. Stanley was the
pride of Dark Harbor.

781
00:53:38.674 --> 00:53:40.717
(chuckles) Wasn't he?

782
00:53:40.717 --> 00:53:42.261
- Yes. he was.

783
00:53:43.429 --> 00:53:44.430
Did you know him?

784
00:53:45.305 --> 00:53:46.682
- Who didn't know Stanley?

785
00:53:48.267 --> 00:53:51.186
- And how do you know Olivia?

786
00:53:51.186 --> 00:53:52.771
- Long-time friends.

787
00:53:52.771 --> 00:53:54.398
- Really?

788
00:53:54.398 --> 00:53:56.400
She never mentioned you. but
don't take it personally.

789
00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.694
She doesn't tell
me much. (chuckles)

790
00:53:58.694 --> 00:54:01.155
- Oh. it's okay. I'm sure
she's under a lot of stress

791
00:54:01.155 --> 00:54:03.323
with the baby soon to arrive.
- Mm-hm.

792
00:54:03.323 --> 00:54:07.077
Well. I don't think a baby
was much on her agenda.

793
00:54:07.077 --> 00:54:10.456
whatever she thought
her agenda might be.

794
00:54:10.456 --> 00:54:12.416
I don't think she would've
continued the pregnancy without

795
00:54:12.416 --> 00:54:15.419
the influence of the boyfriend
who is now the ex-boyfriend.

796
00:54:15.419 --> 00:54:17.838
I think. I don't know.
it's hard to keep track.

797
00:54:25.179 --> 00:54:28.265
(joyful piano music)

798
00:54:54.458 --> 00:54:57.252
(Kellen chuckles)

799
00:55:00.297 --> 00:55:01.632
It's nice to meet a young man

800
00:55:01.632 --> 00:55:04.384
who has such an
appreciation for music.

801
00:55:04.384 --> 00:55:07.888
(Kellen chuckles)

802
00:55:07.888 --> 00:55:10.015
- Well. I'd love to
play another. but.

803
00:55:10.015 --> 00:55:12.434
that's the only song
I know. (chuckles)

804
00:55:12.434 --> 00:55:13.435
- It's a good start.

805
00:55:14.603 --> 00:55:18.315
You know. when I
play. I try to imagine

806
00:55:18.315 --> 00:55:21.401
that each of the notes
is my innermost feelings.

807
00:55:23.195 --> 00:55:28.200
(muffled chatter)
(tense orchestral music)

808
00:55:37.501 --> 00:55:38.293
- Hello.

809
00:55:39.586 --> 00:55:41.505
- I'll make some coffee.
I'll be back in a minute.

810
00:55:48.887 --> 00:55:51.682
(Kellen chuckles)

811
00:55:52.891 --> 00:55:54.893
- You went to the chief.

812
00:55:56.228 --> 00:55:57.020
Why?

813
00:55:58.397 --> 00:55:59.606
- What did you do to me?

814
00:56:02.859 --> 00:56:03.986
- I took care of you.

815
00:56:07.864 --> 00:56:09.199
I was concerned.

816
00:56:11.451 --> 00:56:12.411
about the baby.

817
00:56:13.662 --> 00:56:16.790
(music swells)

818
00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:18.709
(slap)

819
00:56:21.461 --> 00:56:23.338
- It'll just be
another minute or two.

820
00:56:25.882 --> 00:56:27.551
- I'm afraid I have to go.

821
00:56:28.677 --> 00:56:31.555
I'll tell Father
James you said hello.

822
00:56:31.555 --> 00:56:33.515
It's a pleasure meeting
you. Miss Prescott.

823
00:56:33.515 --> 00:56:34.891
- I'll walk you out.

824
00:56:37.728 --> 00:56:39.563
- [Kellen] I didn't know
what else to do. Father.

825
00:56:39.563 --> 00:56:42.608
I've never seen a
sign so clearly.

826
00:56:43.442 --> 00:56:45.986
- I don't think you understand.

827
00:56:45.986 --> 00:56:48.864
- No. Father. I
understand everything now.

828
00:56:51.116 --> 00:56:52.993
- If you have respect
for the church

829
00:56:52.993 --> 00:56:55.662
and you have respect for
me. then you'll do as I say

830
00:56:55.662 --> 00:56:58.290
and you'll leave
the Prescotts alone.

831
00:56:58.290 --> 00:57:00.208
- How can you side with them?

832
00:57:00.208 --> 00:57:01.585
- I'm not siding with anyone.

833
00:57:02.586 --> 00:57:04.463
I'm protecting you.

834
00:57:04.463 --> 00:57:06.048
- [Kellen] From who?

835
00:57:08.508 --> 00:57:09.760
- From yourself.

836
00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:11.511
- Hah!

837
00:57:11.511 --> 00:57:13.639
You think you're my savior now?

838
00:57:13.639 --> 00:57:15.807
(Father James sighs)

839
00:57:15.807 --> 00:57:20.812
- Faith is something that
takes a lifetime to understand.

840
00:57:23.273 --> 00:57:25.817
- I'm beginning to question
your convictions. Father.

841
00:57:28.362 --> 00:57:29.655
Let me ask you somethin'.

842
00:57:31.323 --> 00:57:32.783
I was three months in.

843
00:57:32.783 --> 00:57:35.952
I had a bullseye on
my back from day one.

844
00:57:38.455 --> 00:57:41.083
The woman I raped had a
brother in my cellblock.

845
00:57:42.292 --> 00:57:43.585
What're the odds?

846
00:57:45.087 --> 00:57:47.255
On Sunday mornin'. they
cornered me in the showers.

847
00:57:47.255 --> 00:57:50.008
I figured I was gonna
catch a beatin'.

848
00:57:51.259 --> 00:57:53.136
Maybe they'd teach me a lesson.

849
00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:57.307
Then they may even
have their way with me.

850
00:57:58.475 --> 00:58:00.310
But instead. I saw a blade.

851
00:58:04.398 --> 00:58:07.359
It's funny. at first I
couldn't feel a thing.

852
00:58:07.359 --> 00:58:09.569
I just watched the
blood flood down my leg.

853
00:58:13.824 --> 00:58:16.535
Has anything like that ever
happened to you. Father?

854
00:58:20.664 --> 00:58:21.707
- No.

855
00:58:22.749 --> 00:58:23.542
It hasn't.

856
00:58:25.335 --> 00:58:28.839
- So when you talk about
understanding faith.

857
00:58:30.382 --> 00:58:33.218
no amount of time compares
to an experience like that.

858
00:58:35.721 --> 00:58:37.472
You have a lot to learn. Father.

859
00:58:52.404 --> 00:58:56.032
(muffled door thuds)

860
00:58:56.032 --> 00:58:57.075
(door creaks)

861
00:58:57.075 --> 00:58:58.368
- [Chief] Hey. Regina.

862
00:58:58.368 --> 00:58:59.161
- Robert.

863
00:59:05.459 --> 00:59:06.251
- What happened?

864
00:59:08.128 --> 00:59:08.920
- I fell.

865
00:59:10.672 --> 00:59:11.757
- That so?
- Yeah.

866
00:59:12.758 --> 00:59:13.884
What can I do for you?

867
00:59:15.051 --> 00:59:17.179
- I spoke with
Kellen last night.

868
00:59:17.179 --> 00:59:19.347
I need to talk to him again.

869
00:59:19.347 --> 00:59:20.140
Is he here?

870
00:59:22.726 --> 00:59:23.518
- No.

871
00:59:28.607 --> 00:59:30.692
- You call me immediately
if he stops by.

872
00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:36.072
- Is he in trouble again?

873
00:59:38.992 --> 00:59:40.076
- Call me. Regina.

874
00:59:44.414 --> 00:59:45.332
(door thuds)

875
00:59:45.332 --> 00:59:47.918
(engine starts)

876
00:59:50.796 --> 00:59:53.507
(gulls squawk)

877
00:59:55.592 --> 00:59:59.221
(distant boat horn blows)

878
01:00:14.736 --> 01:00:16.780
- I didn't wanna believe a
single part of what he said.

879
01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:19.741
but when I looked into
Charlie's eyes. I just. I.

880
01:00:21.201 --> 01:00:23.370
I saw this piece of myself.

881
01:00:25.497 --> 01:00:27.374
- What do you suppose
it is that frightens you

882
01:00:27.374 --> 01:00:30.418
about the idea of Charlie
being your brother?

883
01:00:30.418 --> 01:00:32.796
(Olivia chuckles)

884
01:00:32.796 --> 01:00:35.173
- My entire life
has been a betrayal.

885
01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:39.636
And I never really knew
the man that I loved most.

886
01:00:48.603 --> 01:00:50.146
- You know. Olivia. you...

887
01:00:51.773 --> 01:00:55.360
Your father was protecting
you. he knew what having

888
01:00:55.360 --> 01:01:00.156
an illegitimate child would do
to your mother. and in turn.

889
01:01:01.783 --> 01:01:03.076
how that would affect you.

890
01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:06.788
Your father wasn't perfect.

891
01:01:07.747 --> 01:01:09.708
He loved in ways
he shouldn't have.

892
01:01:12.878 --> 01:01:13.670
He. um...

893
01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:20.552
He asked me to set up a
trust for Charlie. and I did.

894
01:01:21.845 --> 01:01:24.472
You see. your father was
concerned that Regina

895
01:01:24.472 --> 01:01:26.892
wouldn't be able to manage
the money herself and...

896
01:01:29.394 --> 01:01:30.896
I kept your father's secret.

897
01:01:32.314 --> 01:01:34.983
That's why I approached you
the way I did at the funeral.

898
01:01:36.902 --> 01:01:38.320
And I'm sorry.

899
01:01:42.782 --> 01:01:45.160
I'm sorry you had to
find out the way you did.

900
01:01:48.663 --> 01:01:50.081
- It's not right. Father.

901
01:01:56.588 --> 01:02:00.967
- It's not always about how
others define what's right.

902
01:02:02.886 --> 01:02:07.057
Humanity is choosing
what's best for others.

903
01:02:12.771 --> 01:02:14.773
Now. if you want. if
you're not comfortable

904
01:02:14.773 --> 01:02:18.568
with the situation. you
can build your own trust.

905
01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:19.778
- It's not about the money.

906
01:02:23.365 --> 01:02:25.617
(chuckles)

907
01:02:25.617 --> 01:02:26.576
I have a brother.

908
01:02:28.745 --> 01:02:29.537
- Yeah.

909
01:02:31.289 --> 01:02:33.583
(chuckles)

910
01:02:35.961 --> 01:02:38.922
(phone vibrates)

911
01:02:41.341 --> 01:02:42.634
- Hello?

912
01:02:42.634 --> 01:02:44.177
- [Robert] Olivia. hi.
it's Chief Sanders.

913
01:02:44.177 --> 01:02:47.597
Listen. Dr. Baker
got the results back
from your blood test.

914
01:02:48.848 --> 01:02:51.059
They did find traces of
rohypnol in your system.

915
01:02:52.477 --> 01:02:53.228
I'm sorry.

916
01:02:55.438 --> 01:02:56.189
- Okay.

917
01:03:07.075 --> 01:03:08.743
(door creaks)

918
01:03:08.743 --> 01:03:10.245
- We need to talk about Charlie.

919
01:03:25.969 --> 01:03:28.596
(door creaks)

920
01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:39.816
- I need to make sure that
Charlie is provided for.

921
01:03:41.026 --> 01:03:42.444
- I'm gonna do everything
that I can for him.

922
01:03:42.444 --> 01:03:44.946
- The child support?
(tense orchestral music)

923
01:03:44.946 --> 01:03:46.156
- It will continue.

924
01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:51.077
But I wanna do more for him.

925
01:03:55.874 --> 01:04:00.003
(sighs) We want Charlie safe.

926
01:04:00.003 --> 01:04:02.630
Just until Kellen is in custody.

927
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:03.548
It's not safe here.

928
01:04:10.513 --> 01:04:12.891
(Regina sobs)

929
01:04:14.392 --> 01:04:16.394
- You know. I offered to
have an abortion when I got

930
01:04:16.394 --> 01:04:19.064
pregnant with Charlie. but
your father wouldn't let me.

931
01:04:25.278 --> 01:04:26.154
- Did he love you?

932
01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:35.497
- He loved you.

933
01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:49.803
Okay. you take Charlie.

934
01:04:49.803 --> 01:04:52.889
I'm gonna stay here and
I'll call Chief Sanders

935
01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:54.974
as soon as Kellen gets home.

936
01:04:54.974 --> 01:04:55.767
- Okay.

937
01:04:56.601 --> 01:04:57.393
- Thank you.

938
01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:06.277
(door creaks)

939
01:05:06.277 --> 01:05:08.029
- Oh. (pants)

940
01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:10.532
- [Regina] Are you okay?

941
01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:13.493
- Yeah.

942
01:05:14.911 --> 01:05:19.916
Yeah. I'm fine.

943
01:05:20.834 --> 01:05:23.670
(tense orchestral music)

944
01:05:27.966 --> 01:05:30.468
(wind howls)

945
01:05:39.144 --> 01:05:42.147
(fire crackles)

946
01:05:42.147 --> 01:05:45.567
(classical piano music)

947
01:05:49.737 --> 01:05:51.030
- (scoffs) Where's Charlie?

948
01:05:53.867 --> 01:05:55.910
- Chief Sanders is
looking for you.

949
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:56.953
- Oh. okay.

950
01:05:56.953 --> 01:05:59.164
- He's gonna put you
away for good. Kellen.

951
01:05:59.164 --> 01:06:01.624
- I'm tryin' to get this
family what we deserve.

952
01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:03.126
- You're ruining
everything for Charlie.

953
01:06:03.126 --> 01:06:04.210
- Charlie needs a father!

954
01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:06.087
- You're not his father!

955
01:06:06.087 --> 01:06:07.130
(Kellen chuckles)

956
01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:08.047
- [Kellen] Charlie!

957
01:06:10.049 --> 01:06:11.050
Charlie!

958
01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:14.137
(muffled clattering)

959
01:06:16.389 --> 01:06:17.557
- No. no. no!

960
01:06:18.725 --> 01:06:19.851
- Where's Charlie?

961
01:06:19.851 --> 01:06:21.603
- He's not here.

962
01:06:21.603 --> 01:06:22.812
- You gave him to the
Prescotts. didn't you?

963
01:06:22.812 --> 01:06:24.397
- [Regina] Yeah. I did!

964
01:06:24.397 --> 01:06:25.690
- [Kellen] Why?

965
01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:27.150
- I'm not gonna let
you ruin his life!

966
01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:29.861
- Olivia doesn't even
want her own daughter.

967
01:06:29.861 --> 01:06:31.112
They're sinners!

968
01:06:31.112 --> 01:06:33.156
- Yeah. look at
you. casting stones!

969
01:06:35.366 --> 01:06:37.160
(tense orchestral music)

970
01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:38.953
I wish I had aborted
you when I had a...

971
01:06:38.953 --> 01:06:41.039
(Kellen grunts)
(thud)

972
01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:43.333
(grunts)
(slap)

973
01:06:43.333 --> 01:06:47.337
No. no!

974
01:06:47.337 --> 01:06:52.342
(oven clicks)
(gasps and chokes)

975
01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:57.847
(fire crackles)
(classical piano music)

976
01:07:16.199 --> 01:07:18.826
(door creaks)

977
01:07:20.536 --> 01:07:21.996
- [Olivia] Mom. this is--

978
01:07:21.996 --> 01:07:23.122
- Hello. Charlie.

979
01:07:38.179 --> 01:07:40.181
(sighs)

980
01:07:40.181 --> 01:07:41.057
I've known for years.

981
01:07:42.642 --> 01:07:45.019
About all the money and all
the lies and all the women.

982
01:07:46.271 --> 01:07:49.065
And you two thought you
were so clever. didn't you?

983
01:07:50.608 --> 01:07:53.111
That son of a bitch
was never faithful.

984
01:07:55.697 --> 01:07:56.489
You knew.

985
01:07:57.782 --> 01:08:01.869
You knew and you
covered it up for years.

986
01:08:01.869 --> 01:08:04.289
(scoffs)

987
01:08:04.289 --> 01:08:05.415
Shame on you.

988
01:08:27.854 --> 01:08:29.230
(somber music)

989
01:08:29.230 --> 01:08:33.192
He was brilliant and he
meant so much to so many.

990
01:08:34.444 --> 01:08:37.280
He lit up every room
that he walked into.

991
01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:39.157
and everybody loved him.

992
01:08:42.994 --> 01:08:44.162
And I loved him.

993
01:08:49.083 --> 01:08:52.337
So I kept it quiet. I
didn't say anything.

994
01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:59.635
But it was my silence that
started eating away at me.

995
01:08:59.635 --> 01:09:02.263
until it hurt you.

996
01:09:06.225 --> 01:09:09.354
As you grew up. I grew
more and more distant.

997
01:09:12.774 --> 01:09:14.484
and you didn't deserve it.

998
01:09:16.903 --> 01:09:18.696
You didn't deserve it.

999
01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:25.286
I'm sorry.

1000
01:09:25.286 --> 01:09:26.371
Oh. God. I'm...

1001
01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.298
I. I'm sorry. I...

1002
01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:44.347
(Olivia sighs)

1003
01:09:44.347 --> 01:09:45.890
- I'm sorry. too.

1004
01:09:49.227 --> 01:09:51.604
- You have nothing
to be sorry about.

1005
01:09:51.604 --> 01:09:52.397
Nothing.

1006
01:10:05.368 --> 01:10:07.453
(chuckles)

1007
01:10:13.501 --> 01:10:14.293
Well.

1008
01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:18.423
I'm Susan.

1009
01:10:28.349 --> 01:10:31.310
(phone vibrates)

1010
01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:34.522
- [Olivia] Hello?

1011
01:10:34.522 --> 01:10:35.565
- Charlie. why don't
you come over here

1012
01:10:35.565 --> 01:10:36.983
and look at these books?

1013
01:10:36.983 --> 01:10:38.526
I think you'll find
them very interesting.

1014
01:10:38.526 --> 01:10:40.111
- [Robert] Olivia.
where are you?

1015
01:10:40.111 --> 01:10:41.070
- I'm home.

1016
01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:42.447
- Listen. we found Regina

1017
01:10:42.447 --> 01:10:44.073
almost beaten to
death at her home.

1018
01:10:44.073 --> 01:10:46.284
They're rushing her to
the hospital right now.

1019
01:10:46.284 --> 01:10:48.161
Kellen's still missing.

1020
01:10:48.161 --> 01:10:49.495
- What?

1021
01:10:49.495 --> 01:10:52.373
- [Robert] She has another
son. Charlie. he's missing too.

1022
01:10:52.373 --> 01:10:53.749
- [Olivia] He's here.

1023
01:10:53.749 --> 01:10:55.376
- [Robert] Excuse me?

1024
01:10:55.376 --> 01:10:56.711
- [Olivia] Charlie's here.
I have him. he's safe.

1025
01:10:56.711 --> 01:10:58.504
- [Robert] I'm on
my way. don't move.

1026
01:10:58.504 --> 01:11:00.298
Olivia.

1027
01:11:00.298 --> 01:11:01.674
- Yeah.
- Stay inside.

1028
01:11:01.674 --> 01:11:03.843
Keep the doors locked. I'll
be there as soon as I can.

1029
01:11:05.011 --> 01:11:06.429
(Olivia sighs)

1030
01:11:06.429 --> 01:11:08.681
(footsteps clack)

1031
01:11:08.681 --> 01:11:09.891
- [Susan] What's happened?

1032
01:11:11.476 --> 01:11:13.811
- They're taking Charlie's
mom to the hospital.

1033
01:11:15.354 --> 01:11:17.690
And they're still
looking for Kellen.

1034
01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:18.858
- Kellen?

1035
01:11:18.858 --> 01:11:20.401
Who was here?

1036
01:11:21.486 --> 01:11:24.322
- Yeah. he's Charlie's
half-brother.

1037
01:11:24.322 --> 01:11:25.615
Chief Sanders is on the way.

1038
01:11:25.615 --> 01:11:27.867
so we should be ready
to go when he gets here.

1039
01:11:34.332 --> 01:11:36.834
- My mom used to read these
to me when I was younger.

1040
01:11:39.837 --> 01:11:41.881
I don't think we have
any of them anymore.

1041
01:12:01.234 --> 01:12:04.237
(suspenseful music)

1042
01:12:19.043 --> 01:12:22.129
- [Kellen] Your
father was a monster.

1043
01:12:36.978 --> 01:12:38.229
- No. no. no.

1044
01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:40.356
- Olivia!
- Oh. no. no.

1045
01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:42.775
- Come with me. come on.

1046
01:12:42.775 --> 01:12:44.110
Come on. keep breathing.

1047
01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:45.528
Breathe. sweetie.

1048
01:12:45.528 --> 01:12:47.196
(Olivia groans)

1049
01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:48.990
Breathe. breathe with me.

1050
01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:49.991
Just breathe.
sweetie. just breathe.

1051
01:12:51.534 --> 01:12:55.913
It's okay. it's okay.
(Olivia pants and groans)

1052
01:12:55.913 --> 01:12:58.332
It's okay. it's okay.
I'm here. I'm here.

1053
01:12:58.332 --> 01:13:00.710
(door rattles)

1054
01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:07.508
- Charlie.

1055
01:13:07.508 --> 01:13:09.260
Come lock the door behind me.

1056
01:13:10.553 --> 01:13:14.890
- It's okay. I've got you.
I've got you. I've got you.

1057
01:13:17.727 --> 01:13:20.354
(door creaks)

1058
01:13:25.568 --> 01:13:27.903
(locks clicks)

1059
01:13:27.903 --> 01:13:30.364
- [Father James] Kellen?

1060
01:13:30.364 --> 01:13:31.407
Can we talk?

1061
01:13:34.327 --> 01:13:35.828
(wind whistles)

1062
01:13:35.828 --> 01:13:36.829
(Olivia groans)

1063
01:13:36.829 --> 01:13:39.498
- I know. sweetie. I know.

1064
01:13:39.498 --> 01:13:41.542
Just breathe. short.
quick breaths.

1065
01:13:41.542 --> 01:13:44.545
(both pant sharply)

1066
01:13:44.545 --> 01:13:47.298
You're doing fine. Olivia.
it's gonna be okay.

1067
01:13:47.298 --> 01:13:48.591
Here it comes again. okay.

1068
01:13:48.591 --> 01:13:51.719
Okay. hold my hand. hold

1069
01:13:51.719 --> 01:13:55.139
(Olivia groans)
Squeeze.

1070
01:14:03.481 --> 01:14:04.523
- Kellen?

1071
01:14:13.199 --> 01:14:15.242
Can we talk?

1072
01:14:15.242 --> 01:14:16.827
- Hold my hand.

1073
01:14:16.827 --> 01:14:18.079
I'm here. sweetie.

1074
01:14:18.079 --> 01:14:20.581
Squeeze my hand. Olivia.
it's gonna be okay.

1075
01:14:20.581 --> 01:14:22.500
She's coming. she's coming.
(Olivia groans)

1076
01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.585
You're doing fine.
you're doing fine.

1077
01:14:27.004 --> 01:14:29.006
- [Father James] There's
nothing to be afraid of.

1078
01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:35.137
(wood creaks)

1079
01:14:37.431 --> 01:14:39.642
- It's about time.
it's about time.

1080
01:14:39.642 --> 01:14:42.645
Look at me. I want you to bear
down and I want you to push!

1081
01:14:42.645 --> 01:14:43.896
I want you to push!

1082
01:14:43.896 --> 01:14:47.983
Push. Olivia. push!
(Olivia grunts)

1083
01:14:52.697 --> 01:14:55.074
(siren wails)

1084
01:14:59.453 --> 01:15:02.373
(Olivia groans)
You're gonna be fine.

1085
01:15:02.373 --> 01:15:04.500
(giggles) Here she comes!
(Olivia pants)

1086
01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.919
(Olivia groans)
(giggles)

1087
01:15:06.919 --> 01:15:09.422
(baby cries)

1088
01:15:11.674 --> 01:15:15.761
(warm orchestral music)
(baby cries)

1089
01:15:15.761 --> 01:15:17.930
Say hi to momma.

1090
01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:20.433
(baby cries)

1091
01:15:30.359 --> 01:15:31.944
Oh. she's beautiful.

1092
01:15:33.446 --> 01:15:37.032
(Olivia chuckles and pants)

1093
01:15:47.293 --> 01:15:49.670
(door creaks)

1094
01:15:52.423 --> 01:15:53.507
(chuckles)

1095
01:15:53.507 --> 01:15:55.551
- Everyone okay?
- She's fine.

1096
01:15:55.551 --> 01:15:56.635
They're fine. everything's fine.

1097
01:16:07.855 --> 01:16:09.690
(ominous orchestral music)

1098
01:16:09.690 --> 01:16:10.733
Oh. oh!

1099
01:16:11.776 --> 01:16:13.778
(Kellen grunts)
No. God. no!

1100
01:16:13.778 --> 01:16:17.948
(blood splashes)
(Robert chokes)

1101
01:16:17.948 --> 01:16:20.576
(body clunks)

1102
01:16:21.452 --> 01:16:24.622
- Kellen.
(Robert groans)

1103
01:16:24.622 --> 01:16:27.625
(suspenseful music)

1104
01:16:36.008 --> 01:16:37.510
What have you done?

1105
01:16:46.352 --> 01:16:48.813
(Kellen pants)

1106
01:17:14.547 --> 01:17:16.507
- [Kellen] Hey. Charlie.

1107
01:17:16.507 --> 01:17:18.676
Why don't you come over
here and stand with me?

1108
01:17:18.676 --> 01:17:21.303
- Let's leave the
boy out of this. hm?

1109
01:17:21.303 --> 01:17:22.096
- I'm not talkin' to you.

1110
01:17:22.096 --> 01:17:23.389
Charlie?

1111
01:17:23.389 --> 01:17:24.431
Come over here.

1112
01:17:24.431 --> 01:17:26.642
- No. no. I wanna go home.

1113
01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:28.102
- I wanna show you
somethin'. buddy.

1114
01:17:28.102 --> 01:17:29.311
- Leave the boy alone.

1115
01:17:31.021 --> 01:17:33.232
- Father. you don't
know what the boy needs.

1116
01:17:34.358 --> 01:17:36.110
God knows what he needs.

1117
01:17:38.153 --> 01:17:39.655
And I'm doing God's work.

1118
01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:44.201
- Do you really believe that?

1119
01:18:01.343 --> 01:18:04.138
- Once upon a time. there
was a boy named Kellen.

1120
01:18:05.764 --> 01:18:09.768
who took beatin' after
beatin' after beatin'.

1121
01:18:09.768 --> 01:18:13.731
Needless to say. his daddy
was a real piece of shit.

1122
01:18:18.444 --> 01:18:22.072
Then one day. along came
a man named Stanley.

1123
01:18:23.532 --> 01:18:28.078
Stanley had the
opportunity and the means.

1124
01:18:28.078 --> 01:18:29.663
to help Kellen.

1125
01:18:30.581 --> 01:18:33.584
and he chose not to help him.

1126
01:18:35.711 --> 01:18:36.503
Why not?

1127
01:18:42.092 --> 01:18:45.846
What kind of sick prick
immortalizes a kid as a worm?

1128
01:18:51.352 --> 01:18:52.144
I ask you.

1129
01:18:59.443 --> 01:19:00.778
(sighs)

1130
01:19:00.778 --> 01:19:04.907
And the days rolled on until
Kellen came to collect.

1131
01:19:06.909 --> 01:19:10.162
and Stanley was eaten by worms.

1132
01:19:11.121 --> 01:19:14.500
and breathed his last.

1133
01:19:21.757 --> 01:19:23.133
That's a good one.

1134
01:19:27.554 --> 01:19:29.807
- You killed him. you
killed my husband.

1135
01:19:29.807 --> 01:19:30.849
- Oh. I wanted to.

1136
01:19:32.643 --> 01:19:34.895
The old coward had
a heart attack.

1137
01:19:36.271 --> 01:19:37.356
It was a let-down.

1138
01:19:38.399 --> 01:19:42.444
But God knew what a man he was.

1139
01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:45.322
and delivered him to
me. as an offering.

1140
01:19:46.782 --> 01:19:48.701
And all was made right.

1141
01:19:49.702 --> 01:19:50.703
(Susan grunts)

1142
01:19:50.703 --> 01:19:51.495
Uh-uh.

1143
01:19:53.539 --> 01:19:54.832
(grunts)
- No!

1144
01:19:54.832 --> 01:19:55.874
(groans)

1145
01:19:55.874 --> 01:19:56.667
- Listen. put it down.

1146
01:19:57.876 --> 01:19:59.753
Just put it down.

1147
01:20:00.921 --> 01:20:01.714
That's enough.

1148
01:20:04.883 --> 01:20:06.135
I don't want to do this.

1149
01:20:07.553 --> 01:20:09.179
- You're so weak.

1150
01:20:10.389 --> 01:20:12.224
You're not gonna
pull that trigger.

1151
01:20:12.224 --> 01:20:13.017
- Kellen.

1152
01:20:14.268 --> 01:20:15.227
Let's stop. hm?

1153
01:20:18.313 --> 01:20:20.107
- I'll put it down.
I'll put it down.

1154
01:20:21.233 --> 01:20:26.196
(metal clangs)
(Father James yelps)

1155
01:20:31.035 --> 01:20:33.412
(metal thuds)

1156
01:20:38.542 --> 01:20:42.296
This is God's plan.

1157
01:20:48.469 --> 01:20:50.721
(chuckles)

1158
01:20:52.514 --> 01:20:53.265
That baby

1159
01:20:55.184 --> 01:20:56.852
has been delivered to me.

1160
01:21:05.944 --> 01:21:07.237
I'm the father.

1161
01:21:11.533 --> 01:21:14.119
- [Susan] Dear God. no. no.

1162
01:21:14.119 --> 01:21:15.871
- Move. move.
- Oh. dear God. no.

1163
01:21:15.871 --> 01:21:16.747
- No. no.

1164
01:21:17.790 --> 01:21:19.208
(guns cocks)
(gasps)

1165
01:21:19.208 --> 01:21:20.000
No!

1166
01:21:21.376 --> 01:21:22.378
- Move!
- No!

1167
01:21:24.129 --> 01:21:24.922
God!

1168
01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:29.051
(knife scrapes)

1169
01:21:29.051 --> 01:21:30.886
- Let the children.

1170
01:21:32.054 --> 01:21:34.306
come to me.
(knife slices)

1171
01:21:34.306 --> 01:21:36.058
Do not hinder them.

1172
01:21:38.477 --> 01:21:41.021
For the kingdom of heaven

1173
01:21:42.439 --> 01:21:47.444
belongs to such as these. shh.
(baby cries)

1174
01:21:49.446 --> 01:21:53.992
(chuckles)
(baby cries)

1175
01:21:55.494 --> 01:21:58.622
Charlie. can you go
fetch us a bowl of water?

1176
01:21:58.622 --> 01:22:00.833
Priest James. I'm gonna
need you to get up.

1177
01:22:00.833 --> 01:22:01.959
Olivia. you too.

1178
01:22:03.252 --> 01:22:05.379
It's time for the baptism.

1179
01:22:05.379 --> 01:22:08.382
(baby cries)

1180
01:22:08.382 --> 01:22:09.758
Come on. come on. come on.

1181
01:22:11.468 --> 01:22:12.261
Good boy.

1182
01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:15.806
Olivia. I'm gonna
need to stand. please.

1183
01:22:15.806 --> 01:22:18.100
(baby cries)

1184
01:22:21.395 --> 01:22:22.729
Come on up.

1185
01:22:22.729 --> 01:22:24.815
Join the family.
- Oh. no.

1186
01:22:29.027 --> 01:22:30.696
- We're a family now.

1187
01:22:39.163 --> 01:22:39.955
We're ready.

1188
01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:42.457
Isn't she precious?

1189
01:22:49.131 --> 01:22:50.465
(kiss)

1190
01:22:59.099 --> 01:23:01.310
(chuckles)

1191
01:23:02.728 --> 01:23:03.937
Bless my baby.

1192
01:23:06.607 --> 01:23:07.399
- Yeah.

1193
01:23:16.867 --> 01:23:21.205
And even as John the Baptist
came forth from the water.

1194
01:23:22.664 --> 01:23:24.374
they thought him mad.

1195
01:23:26.084 --> 01:23:27.794
(music swells)

1196
01:23:27.794 --> 01:23:32.799

(sharp thuds)
(Kellen groans)

1198
01:23:39.306 --> 01:23:41.475
Stay back. stay back.

1199
01:23:41.475 --> 01:23:46.146
(Olivia grunts)
(sharp rapid thuds)

1200

(peaceful orchestral music)

1203
01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:29.815
And so. in the
name of the Father.

1204
01:24:31.233 --> 01:24:34.653
and of the Son. and
of the Holy Spirit.

1205
01:24:36.071 --> 01:24:40.075
I christen you. Charlotte
McKinley Prescott.

(door thuds)

1207
01:25:01.555 --> 01:25:02.347
- Charlie.

1208
01:25:19.031 --> 01:25:21.158
- She's a beautiful girl.

1209
01:25:23.327 --> 01:25:25.329
So how are ya. are you okay?

1210
01:25:27.331 --> 01:25:28.707
- Still having nightmares.

1211
01:25:31.918 --> 01:25:33.253
- I think we always will.

1212
01:25:37.883 --> 01:25:39.343
- Look after my mom for me.

1213
01:25:42.429 --> 01:25:44.556
- Of course. of course I will.

1214
01:25:47.184 --> 01:25:48.560
How about your father?

1215
01:25:54.107 --> 01:25:54.900
- What about him?

1216
01:25:57.861 --> 01:26:00.572
- You think you'll find it
in your heart to forgive him?

1217
01:26:02.032 --> 01:26:05.410
(distant boat horn blows)

1218
01:26:11.083 --> 01:26:12.250
Forgiveness. Olivia.

1219
01:26:14.294 --> 01:26:16.380
It's the best medicine
for the heart.

1220
01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:23.553
You be well now.

1221
01:26:26.848 --> 01:26:28.392
You take care of yourself.

1222
01:26:42.406 --> 01:26:43.490
- You take good pictures.

1223
01:26:49.371 --> 01:26:51.623
- [Olivia] You all
packed for the city?

1224
01:26:51.623 --> 01:26:52.416
- Yeah.

1225
01:27:02.467 --> 01:27:04.177
- Hey. Charlie. can I see that?
