I don't play basketball.
I don't play volleyball.

22
00:00:50.822 --> 00:00:51.854
I'm not a model.

23
00:00:51.923 --> 00:00:53.255
and since I have
everybody's attention.

24
00:00:53.324 --> 00:00:55.224
just wanna let you all know

25
00:00:55.293 --> 00:00:57.259

00:00:59.063 --> 00:01:01.157
Clean 'em up!

28

They're all greasy and dusty
and shit. What's that about?

29
00:01:05.436 --> 00:01:08.037
I get mistaken for a man
sometimes. It's all good.

30
00:01:08.106 --> 00:01:09.633
I don't care.
I'm very confident.

31
00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:11.374
I don't give a fuck. right?

32
00:01:11.443 --> 00:01:12.908
(laughter)

33
00:01:12.977 --> 00:01:14.543
But sometimes.
it hurts my feelings.

34
00:01:14.612 --> 00:01:15.878
(laughter)

35
00:01:15.947 --> 00:01:17.312
When I was flying out
to New York.

36
00:01:17.381 --> 00:01:19.014
as soon as we land-- Now.

37
00:01:19.083 --> 00:01:21.749
I don't look like this
when I fly. right?

38
00:01:21.818 --> 00:01:25.153
I'm. like. sweatpants.
you know. sneakers.
baggy T-shirt.

39
00:01:25.222 --> 00:01:28.423
hair pulled back.
glasses. mask. right? No makeup.

40
00:01:28.492 --> 00:01:31.626
And so. when we land
in New York.

41
00:01:31.695 --> 00:01:34.362
the woman across the aisle.
she-- she props up.

42
00:01:34.431 --> 00:01:37.365
She's a tiny woman.
She props up out of her chair.

43
00:01:37.434 --> 00:01:38.667
You know. she's getting her bag.

44
00:01:38.736 --> 00:01:41.173
but she starts struggling
with her bag.

45
00:01:43.573 --> 00:01:46.345
And then this
fine-ass Black guy

46
00:01:47.144 --> 00:01:48.839
helps her with her bag.

47
00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:50.946
And I was like.
I'm gonna struggle.

48
00:01:51.015 --> 00:01:53.082
(laughter. applause)

49
00:01:53.151 --> 00:01:54.786
With my bag. right?

50
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.221
But like I said. I didn't
look like this. right?

51
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.022
So. I get up. and I'm like.

52
00:02:01.091 --> 00:02:03.528
-"Oh." (pouty sigh)
-(laughter)

53
00:02:04.795 --> 00:02:07.127
"My little wrist.

54
00:02:07.632 --> 00:02:08.964
Owie!"

55
00:02:09.033 --> 00:02:11.100
(groans) And he looks at me.
He's like.

56
00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:12.801
"You got that. bro?"

57
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.970
(laughter)

58
00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:16.105
I didn't give a fuck.
I was like.

59
00:02:16.174 --> 00:02:18.173
"Yeah. it's all good. dog!

60
00:02:18.242 --> 00:02:19.878
-Don't even trip."
-(applause)

61
00:02:21.278 --> 00:02:23.278
I am Latina.
Any Latinos in the house?

62
00:02:23.347 --> 00:02:26.782
-(cheering. applause)
-Nice.

63
00:02:26.851 --> 00:02:28.517
Yeah.

64
00:02:28.586 --> 00:02:31.086
I'm a-- I'm a very proud Latina.

65
00:02:31.155 --> 00:02:32.855
I'm a very proud Latina.
Um...

66
00:02:32.924 --> 00:02:34.184
And it was-- it was--

67
00:02:34.253 --> 00:02:36.524
It's funny because. you know.
because of how I look.

68
00:02:36.593 --> 00:02:38.793
people don't think
I'm Latina. right?

69
00:02:38.862 --> 00:02:41.696
I once. when I worked as
a bank teller. I had this woman.

70
00:02:41.765 --> 00:02:43.565
A lot of people think I'm mixed
with Black and white.

71
00:02:43.634 --> 00:02:45.300
especially in California.
In New York. y'all know.

72
00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:47.602
Y'all don't get it fucked up
in New York. Y'all know.

73
00:02:47.671 --> 00:02:49.638
You guys got everything in
New York. so you're just like.

74
00:02:49.707 --> 00:02:53.608
"Ah. mija !" Right?
As soon as they see me. "Ah!"

75
00:02:53.677 --> 00:02:55.911
But in California. they're--
if you don't look Mexican.
they're like.

76
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.148
-"What?"
-(laughter)

77
00:02:59.217 --> 00:03:02.317
So. I'm working as
a teller. uh. in Cali.

78
00:03:02.386 --> 00:03:05.320
and this customer.
her account was all fucked up.

79
00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:08.990
and she starts talking shit
about me in Spanish

80
00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:11.726
-at the teller window
right in front of me. right?
-(booing)

81
00:03:11.795 --> 00:03:13.495
Probably thought I was mixed
Black and white.

82
00:03:13.564 --> 00:03:15.597
Probably didn't know
I spoke Spanish.

83
00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:18.166
So. she's talking shit. And as
soon as she finishes. I'm like.

84
00:03:18.235 --> 00:03:19.634
"Oh. I'm sorry. (laughs)

85
00:03:19.703 --> 00:03:22.307
"Looks like I won't be able to
help you with this account..."

86
00:03:25.243 --> 00:03:28.313
(applause. cheering)

87
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.414
So. she was upset.
She was upset.

88
00:03:33.483 --> 00:03:35.751
She's upset.
She goes up to my manager.

89
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.353
She's like. "Oh. my God!

90
00:03:38.422 --> 00:03:40.756
This young woman just called me
an old bitch in Spanish."

91
00:03:40.825 --> 00:03:42.958
And my manager was like.
"(gasps) Wha...

92
00:03:43.027 --> 00:03:45.393
She is Black and white!
She don't speak Spanish!"

93
00:03:45.462 --> 00:03:48.196
I was like... (imitates airhorn)

94
00:03:48.265 --> 00:03:50.132
Wu-Tang is for the children!

95
00:03:50.201 --> 00:03:52.771
Bobby Digital!
(beeping) Um...

96
00:03:54.138 --> 00:03:57.740
-Stupid bitch. Um...
-(laughter)

97
00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:59.675
It's crazy though because.
like. you know.

98
00:03:59.744 --> 00:04:01.243
Latinos. we're everything.
right?

99
00:04:01.312 --> 00:04:03.378
We're the blackest Black.
we're the whitest white.

100
00:04:03.447 --> 00:04:05.647
We look like every--
We are everybody. right?

101
00:04:05.716 --> 00:04:09.284
That's why we're
taking over. girl. ha! Um...

102
00:04:09.353 --> 00:04:11.018
But it's-it's a mind-fuck
in Hollywood. too.

103
00:04:11.087 --> 00:04:13.521
because. like Sofia Vergara--
I don't know if you guys know.

104
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.758
but Sofia Vergara.
when she got "Modern Family."

105
00:04:15.827 --> 00:04:18.427
it was because
she dyed her hair brown.

106
00:04:18.496 --> 00:04:20.895
so she could look
"more Latina." right?

107
00:04:20.964 --> 00:04:23.559
Which is crazy. That's fucked up
that she had to do that.

108
00:04:23.628 --> 00:04:26.301
And then when she got the role
on "Modern Family."
what happened?

109
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.671
The Latinos gave her backlash

110
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.705
because she was
"too stereotypical."

111
00:04:30.774 --> 00:04:32.608
They didn't like the way
she represented Latinos.

112
00:04:32.677 --> 00:04:34.009
And I was like. (clicks tongue)

113
00:04:34.078 --> 00:04:36.779
I got a lot of family members
that act like her. okay?

114
00:04:36.848 --> 00:04:38.580
(laughter)

115
00:04:38.649 --> 00:04:41.686
Yeah. it's my gay Uncles
pero still. you know. like?

116
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.057
They deserve representation.

117
00:04:48.025 --> 00:04:50.992
So. because I grew up
in a conservative. uh. town.

118
00:04:51.061 --> 00:04:53.462
I-- you know.
I don't identify as white.
I don't.

119
00:04:53.531 --> 00:04:56.331
I identify as white-passing.
and the difference

120
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.533
between white
and white-passing

121
00:04:58.602 --> 00:05:01.870
is that I would never put
my parents in a nursing home.

122
00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:04.006
-Um...
-(applause)

123
00:05:04.075 --> 00:05:07.710
-(laughs) Oh shit.
-(cheering)

124
00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:09.014
Thank you.

125
00:05:10.414 --> 00:05:12.481

I can't have you guys
applauding every joke.

128
00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.652
-I don't got that kind of time.
Please don't do that.
-(laughter)

129
00:05:17.721 --> 00:05:19.788
Just laugh. I-I don't wanna

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:28.230
I know. girl. Um...

133
00:05:28.299 --> 00:05:31.467
So. the pandemic fucked
shit up. right?

134
00:05:31.536 --> 00:05:32.768
I think it-- it changed me.

135
00:05:32.837 --> 00:05:34.169
I don't know if it
changed you. guys.

136
00:05:34.238 --> 00:05:36.571
I appreciate you guys
all coming out.

137
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.408
You guys aren't wearing masks.
What is wrong with you?

138
00:05:38.477 --> 00:05:39.407
I don't know.

139
00:05:39.476 --> 00:05:42.343
Shout out to you. sir.
Thank you.

140
00:05:42.412 --> 00:05:44.612
Um. but the pandemic
changed me.

141
00:05:44.681 --> 00:05:46.447
Remember at the begin--
It's been so long. right?

142
00:05:46.516 --> 00:05:48.016
It's been so long.
Remember at the beginning.

143
00:05:48.085 --> 00:05:51.019
people were posting
stupid shit on social media?

144
00:05:51.088 --> 00:05:53.088
I had hella friends just

145
00:05:53.157 --> 00:05:54.589
I had one friend that was like.

148
00:05:58.862 --> 00:06:01.696

00:06:06.737 --> 00:06:08.403

154
00:06:13.345 --> 00:06:14.575

Hashtag hella broke.

156
00:06:17.316 --> 00:06:18.914
Okay. Alright.

I know who I'm gonna
hit up for bail money.

158
00:06:21.085 --> 00:06:22.617
(laughter. applause)

159
00:06:22.686 --> 00:06:24.753
And then. the vaccine
rollout happened.

160
00:06:24.822 --> 00:06:26.655
and I was so excited.
you know.

161
00:06:26.724 --> 00:06:29.692
because being single during
the pandemic was rough. right?

162
00:06:29.761 --> 00:06:31.860
-(audience agreeing)
-It was rough!

163
00:06:31.929 --> 00:06:33.729
Me and all my homegirls

164
00:06:33.798 --> 00:06:34.997
when the vaccine

00:06:38.302 --> 00:06:41.097
"Yeah. me--"
Bitch. I was so desperate.

168
00:06:41.166 --> 00:06:43.439
I almost ordered

169
00:06:43.508 --> 00:06:45.235
(laughter)

170
00:06:45.304 --> 00:06:46.608
That's where I was at.

171
00:06:46.677 --> 00:06:48.711
it was gonna show up
and be 5'6".

172
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.212
(laughter)

173
00:06:50.281 --> 00:06:51.480
I turn it on. it be like.

174
00:06:51.549 --> 00:06:54.116

"I am 5'9". Beep. boop. boop."

175
00:06:54.185 --> 00:06:57.417
(applause. laughter)

176
00:06:58.255 --> 00:06:59.554
I don't know why. y'all men.

177
00:06:59.623 --> 00:07:01.156
you guys always lie
about your height.

178
00:07:01.225 --> 00:07:02.892
I don't know
what that's about.

179
00:07:02.961 --> 00:07:04.659
Men lie so much
about their height.

180
00:07:04.728 --> 00:07:07.896
they accuse me of
being seven feet tall.

181
00:07:07.965 --> 00:07:09.531
(laughter)

182
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.866
That's happened
more than three times.

183
00:07:11.935 --> 00:07:15.204
You realize how
fucked up that is?
Anyways. alright.

184
00:07:15.273 --> 00:07:19.041
So. I was getting--
I was getting thirsty. man.
It was hard.

185
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.676
And then. in the group chat.
we were all like.

186
00:07:20.745 --> 00:07:21.877
I just wanna get
back out there.

187
00:07:21.946 --> 00:07:23.612
I'm gonna join the dating
websites. Me. too.

188
00:07:23.681 --> 00:07:24.780
And one of my homegirls
was like.

189
00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:27.086
"Marcella.
I just miss kissing."

190
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.418
(laughter)

191
00:07:29.487 --> 00:07:31.186
I was like. "It's been
two years. bitch.

192
00:07:31.255 --> 00:07:33.155
I wanna be railed into a wall."

193
00:07:33.224 --> 00:07:36.091
(applause. laughter)

194
00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.761
I want a dude to blow
my back out so hard.

195
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:42.067
my scoliosis reverses.
you feel me?

196
00:07:44.902 --> 00:07:46.634
God damn.

197
00:07:46.703 --> 00:07:49.604
Kissing. I don't even kiss
one-night stands.

198
00:07:49.673 --> 00:07:52.174
I had a one-night stand try
to kiss me once. I was like.

199
00:07:52.243 --> 00:07:54.076
"Sir. ew! I don't know you!"

200
00:07:54.145 --> 00:07:57.012
(laughter)

201
00:07:57.081 --> 00:08:00.148
-Now. let's go raw dog. come on.

202
00:08:00.217 --> 00:08:03.186
Oh. we got some hoes in

203
00:08:03.255 --> 00:08:04.554

204
00:08:04.623 --> 00:08:06.754
-Yeah.
-(cheering continues)

205
00:08:06.823 --> 00:08:11.293
Alright. relax. you
thirsty-ass bitches. God damn.

206
00:08:11.362 --> 00:08:14.629
Uh. and I-- you know what I miss

207
00:08:14.698 --> 00:08:16.665
-is going out dancing.
-(sad groans)

208
00:08:16.734 --> 00:08:18.266
That's-- All the girls got sad.

209
00:08:18.335 --> 00:08:20.135
-(laughter)
-I know! I miss it!

210
00:08:20.204 --> 00:08:22.470
I miss going out dancing.
I used to go every week.

211
00:08:22.539 --> 00:08:24.973
It was so fun.
and I miss going out dancing.

212
00:08:25.042 --> 00:08:28.075
Um. I-I-- My favorite is going
to gay clubs. right?

213
00:08:28.144 --> 00:08:31.379
I love going to gay clubs 'cause
gay men love straight women.
They love--

214
00:08:31.448 --> 00:08:33.015
You could walk in.
looking like shit.

215
00:08:33.084 --> 00:08:35.550
-I've done it before.
-(laughter)

216
00:08:35.619 --> 00:08:37.086
And one time--
It's a safe space. right?

217
00:08:37.155 --> 00:08:38.786
They're not gon--
They're not there
to bug you. right?

218
00:08:38.855 --> 00:08:40.923
You can just do whatever.
You can smell however you want.

219
00:08:40.992 --> 00:08:41.957
No one cares.

220
00:08:42.026 --> 00:08:43.558
I one time walked
into a gay club.

221
00:08:43.627 --> 00:08:45.693
looking like straight-up shit
head-to-toe.

222
00:08:45.762 --> 00:08:47.662
and as soon as I walked in.
this little queen was like.

223
00:08:47.731 --> 00:08:50.666
"Yes. girl!
You serving hobo realness!"

224
00:08:50.735 --> 00:08:53.468
-(applause)
-(laughs)

225
00:08:53.537 --> 00:08:56.972
I was like. "Thank you!
Thank you."

226
00:08:57.041 --> 00:08:58.534
But I hate going
to straight clubs

227
00:08:58.603 --> 00:09:01.876
'cause. men. y'all have lost
your sense of decorum.

228
00:09:01.945 --> 00:09:04.180
Motherfuckers went from.
"May I have this dance." to...

229
00:09:04.249 --> 00:09:05.809
(grunting)

230
00:09:05.878 --> 00:09:07.082
(laughter)

231
00:09:07.151 --> 00:09:09.651
(grunting)

232
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.087
Just shit-faced drunk.
just thrusting their genitals.

233
00:09:12.156 --> 00:09:15.023
-They're doing (blubbering).
-(laughter)

234
00:09:15.092 --> 00:09:17.287
You're just minding
your business with your girl.

235
00:09:17.356 --> 00:09:18.693
doing the little
junior high circle.

236
00:09:18.762 --> 00:09:21.996
-minding your business. right?
-(laughter)

237
00:09:22.065 --> 00:09:24.533
And they just. (grunting)--
"Oh. my God! Is that a mosquito?

238
00:09:24.602 --> 00:09:27.368
-Ah!"
-(applause)

239
00:09:27.437 --> 00:09:29.637
And straight dudes
are tenacious.

240
00:09:29.706 --> 00:09:31.673
It's a numbers game for
straight men. They're like.

241
00:09:31.742 --> 00:09:33.441
"Oh my bad. my bad."
And they just move on.

242
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:36.916
-(blubbering)
-(laughter)

243
00:09:37.782 --> 00:09:39.381
"Oh. no. my bad.
my bad. my bad."

244
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:41.483
-(grunting)
-(laughter)

245
00:09:41.552 --> 00:09:42.988
(blubbering)

246
00:09:45.256 --> 00:09:47.222
And then when you try to be
like. "Oh. no. thank you."

247
00:09:47.291 --> 00:09:48.690
they're just. they just...

248
00:09:48.759 --> 00:09:50.058
"Hey. you don't have
to play hard to get."

249
00:09:50.127 --> 00:09:52.295
Sir. you're playing
hard to get away from!

250
00:09:52.364 --> 00:09:53.628
(applause)

251
00:09:53.697 --> 00:09:57.467
Leave me alone.
No means no. Bill Cosby. Um...

252
00:09:57.536 --> 00:10:00.135
(shocked groans)

253
00:10:00.204 --> 00:10:02.438
If that's what you're
offended by. just buckle up.

254
00:10:02.507 --> 00:10:03.939
(laughter)

255
00:10:04.008 --> 00:10:07.409
I got some shit in
the second half. Alright. um...

256
00:10:07.478 --> 00:10:09.711
But I do.
I miss going out dancing.

257
00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:11.213
I. uh... (laughs)

258
00:10:11.282 --> 00:10:13.882
I one time had a guy
approach me at the bar.

259
00:10:13.951 --> 00:10:17.152
He comes right up to me.
He's like.
"I been watchin' you."

260
00:10:17.221 --> 00:10:19.658
Which is a bad start.
right. ladies?

261
00:10:20.325 --> 00:10:22.691
Creepy as fuck.

262
00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.527
He's like. "You're very tall."

263
00:10:25.596 --> 00:10:28.964
I was like. cool. he has
eyeballs? I don't...

264
00:10:29.033 --> 00:10:31.166
He's like. "You don't move
like a tall person."

265
00:10:31.235 --> 00:10:33.501
-What the fuck does that mean?
-(laughter)

266
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:34.970
Does he expect me
to walk in the room

267
00:10:35.039 --> 00:10:36.939
and just start dunking on fools?

268
00:10:37.008 --> 00:10:38.907
(laughter)

269
00:10:38.976 --> 00:10:41.410
Soon as I walk in. every room
I walk into. I'm like.

270
00:10:41.479 --> 00:10:43.546
"Hey. guys.
I'm here from downtown!"

271
00:10:43.615 --> 00:10:46.114
(applause)

272
00:10:46.183 --> 00:10:48.984
"What's up. y'all?
Boom-shakalaka!

273
00:10:49.053 --> 00:10:53.088
She's on fire!" I don't know
what I'm doing wrong.

274
00:10:53.157 --> 00:10:55.924
I once had a guy roll up on me.
Literally. He's in a wheelchair.

275
00:10:55.993 --> 00:10:58.493
-He rolls up.
-(laughter)

276
00:10:58.562 --> 00:11:00.863
I'm so excited.
I don't have a type.

277
00:11:00.932 --> 00:11:02.665
I really don't.
Short. tall. fat. skinny.

278
00:11:02.734 --> 00:11:03.865
I don't give a fuck.
You got a dick?

279
00:11:03.934 --> 00:11:05.501
I wanna see it.
I wanna smell it.

280
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.807
(applause)

281
00:11:09.674 --> 00:11:11.241
I'm like a curious puppy.

282
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:14.213
(rapid sniffing)

283
00:11:17.915 --> 00:11:21.116
So this fool rolls up.
I'm excited. He goes like this.

284
00:11:21.185 --> 00:11:23.318
I love confidence in a man.
When he goes like this.

285
00:11:23.387 --> 00:11:24.948
I'm like. oh. what's up?

286
00:11:25.017 --> 00:11:26.391
(laughter)

287
00:11:27.391 --> 00:11:28.623
And he says. and I quote.

288
00:11:28.692 --> 00:11:32.161
"You would be perfect
if you had a fat ass."

289
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:33.996
(audience gasps)

290
00:11:34.065 --> 00:11:36.465
I was like.
"You don't have legs."

291
00:11:36.534 --> 00:11:39.134
(laughter)

292
00:11:39.203 --> 00:11:42.637
(applause)

293
00:11:42.706 --> 00:11:44.039
And I wasn't even
gonna bring it up!

294
00:11:44.108 --> 00:11:46.441
I had no problem
with this shit. right?

295
00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:48.477
I'm glad you guys
enjoyed that.

296
00:11:48.546 --> 00:11:50.045
(laughter)

297
00:11:50.114 --> 00:11:51.881
For anybody at home
who's watching

298
00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:53.543
and is uptight about it.
just so you know.

299
00:11:53.612 --> 00:11:56.151
I'm not the bad guy
in that story. okay?

300
00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.621
MLK taught me to judge people by
the content of their character.

301
00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:03.258
-That dude was a dick. right?
-(applause)

302
00:12:03.327 --> 00:12:05.160
Because think about it.
He could have been clever

303
00:12:05.229 --> 00:12:07.262
with this shit.
but he chose to neg me.

304
00:12:07.331 --> 00:12:08.697
I hate when men neg.

305
00:12:08.766 --> 00:12:10.132
For-- Young women.
do not fall for negging.

306
00:12:10.201 --> 00:12:13.301
Negging is when a man includes
a insult in his compliment.

307
00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:15.737
That's not a compliment.
Just say I'm perfect.

308
00:12:15.806 --> 00:12:17.472
We both know that's not true.
Who gives a fuck?

309
00:12:17.541 --> 00:12:18.908
Are you trying to fuck or not?

310
00:12:18.977 --> 00:12:21.813
(applause. laughter)

311
00:12:22.447 --> 00:12:23.639
Right?

312
00:12:23.708 --> 00:12:25.647
And he could have been clever
with this shit.

313
00:12:25.716 --> 00:12:27.615
He could've fucking rolled up.
did this.

314
00:12:27.684 --> 00:12:29.885
I would've been like.
"What's up?"
He could've been like.

315
00:12:29.954 --> 00:12:32.120
"You ain't got no ass.
I ain't got no legs.

316
00:12:32.189 --> 00:12:34.155
Together.
we make a whole person."

317
00:12:34.224 --> 00:12:36.219
-(cheering)
-I'd have been like.

318
00:12:36.288 --> 00:12:38.261
"Oh. shit. let's go!"

319
00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.366
(applause)

320
00:12:44.468 --> 00:12:47.663
-Your guys' clapping
is stressing me out. Um...
-(laughter)

321
00:12:47.732 --> 00:12:51.206
I don't like it.
You guys are too lit right now!

322
00:12:51.275 --> 00:12:53.773
I'm good. huh?
That's the problem. Um.

323
00:12:54.646 --> 00:12:56.479
(laughing)

324
00:12:56.548 --> 00:12:58.013
(applause)

325
00:12:58.082 --> 00:13:00.049
They got it. They heard it.

326
00:13:00.118 --> 00:13:01.616
But ever since
I was a little girl.

327
00:13:01.685 --> 00:13:03.585
I always wanted a man
to approach me

328
00:13:03.654 --> 00:13:07.388
the way Michael Jackson used
to approach women in his videos.

329
00:13:07.457 --> 00:13:09.892
That's all I ever wanted.
Ever since I was a little girl.

330
00:13:09.961 --> 00:13:12.064
I just wanted a guy
to be all like--

331
00:13:12.697 --> 00:13:15.935
(laughter)

332
00:13:19.904 --> 00:13:23.639
"What's your name?
(imitating Michael Jackson)

333
00:13:23.708 --> 00:13:26.274
(laughter)

334
00:13:26.343 --> 00:13:27.109
(sings high note)

335
00:13:27.178 --> 00:13:30.415
(imitating Michael Jackson)

336
00:13:33.251 --> 00:13:35.587
(laughter)

337
00:13:36.754 --> 00:13:39.992
(applause)

338
00:13:43.461 --> 00:13:44.727
"Can I buy you a drink?

339
00:13:44.796 --> 00:13:46.328
(laughter)

340
00:13:46.397 --> 00:13:49.565
Vodka tonic? Be right back."
Just moonwalks.

341
00:13:49.634 --> 00:13:51.734
(laughter. applause)

342
00:13:51.803 --> 00:13:53.438
Into my heart. Okay.

343
00:13:55.306 --> 00:13:56.341
(laughs)

344
00:13:57.742 --> 00:13:59.011
(laughs)

345
00:14:00.712 --> 00:14:02.878
This is too much. Um...

346
00:14:02.947 --> 00:14:05.381
Anybody drunk?
I'm fuckin' lit.
bitch. right up.

347
00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:08.184
(cheering)

348
00:14:08.253 --> 00:14:09.150
(sighs)

349
00:14:09.219 --> 00:14:11.120
But here's the thing.
I realized

350
00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:13.588
that I don't want
all that shit. right?

351
00:14:13.657 --> 00:14:16.125
I was like. I don't--
I miss going out dancing.

352
00:14:16.194 --> 00:14:19.394
but I don't-- I don't miss
these dudes. right?

353
00:14:19.463 --> 00:14:22.197
And I was like.
I need to work on myself.

354
00:14:22.266 --> 00:14:24.500
Because the truth is I'm 37.

355
00:14:24.569 --> 00:14:26.134
and I've been single

356
00:14:26.203 --> 00:14:28.704
-all those 37 years.
-(laughter)

357
00:14:28.773 --> 00:14:31.073
And during the pandemic.
I was like.

358
00:14:31.142 --> 00:14:32.741
"Oh. shit. it's me."

359
00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:34.776
(laughter)

360
00:14:34.845 --> 00:14:36.078
It's me. I'm the problem.
And. bitch.

361
00:14:36.147 --> 00:14:39.281
if you're not laughing.
girl. it's you.

362
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:41.617
You need to work on yourself.
You need to do some
self-reflecting--

363
00:14:41.686 --> 00:14:44.853
-Don't point at her!
-(laughter)

364
00:14:44.922 --> 00:14:46.558
Oh. it's you. (laughs)

365
00:14:47.625 --> 00:14:49.759
And she said. "It's us."

366
00:14:49.828 --> 00:14:51.594
It's her and I.

367
00:14:51.663 --> 00:14:53.396
We. too. are the problem.

368
00:14:53.465 --> 00:14:54.964
(laughter)

369
00:14:55.033 --> 00:14:57.633
That goofy-ass outfit.
of course. you're single. Um...

370
00:14:57.702 --> 00:15:00.469
Audience:
Oh!

371
00:15:00.538 --> 00:15:03.175
(applause)

372
00:15:04.809 --> 00:15:07.609
Me deflecting your kisses.
Ah! Ah!

373
00:15:07.678 --> 00:15:09.912
Uh. and I realized I need
to work on myself. right?

374
00:15:09.981 --> 00:15:12.280
I was like. bitch.
it's time to grow up. right?

375
00:15:12.349 --> 00:15:14.883
And then I started thinking
about shit. how I am.

376
00:15:14.952 --> 00:15:17.319
I had an epiphany
when I was watching

377
00:15:17.388 --> 00:15:19.120
"Beauty and the Beast"
with my niece.

378
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:20.621
Okay. it's her favorite movie.

379
00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:23.025
Of course. I grew up
in the '90s. right?
I love that movie.

380
00:15:23.094 --> 00:15:26.327
So we're watching it.
and we get to that scene where.

381
00:15:26.396 --> 00:15:28.363
you know.
Belle has that realization.

382
00:15:28.432 --> 00:15:30.665
and the snowball fight scene.
you know what I'm talking about?

383
00:15:30.734 --> 00:15:33.068
Where she starts. like.
looking at him different.

384
00:15:33.137 --> 00:15:34.937
(scattered laughter)

385
00:15:35.006 --> 00:15:36.171
She starts realizing shit.

386
00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.509
I was like. I start
realizing shit. you know?

387
00:15:39.578 --> 00:15:42.614
-I mean...
-(laughter)

388
00:15:43.581 --> 00:15:45.881
I'm coarse.

389
00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:47.750
I'm unrefined. I'm the Beast!

390
00:15:47.819 --> 00:15:50.055
-No!
-(laughter)

391
00:15:51.221 --> 00:15:53.154
And I was like.
let me chill out.

392
00:15:53.223 --> 00:15:55.490
We kept watching
the movie. right?

393
00:15:55.559 --> 00:15:57.058
As we watched the movie.
I was like. oh!

394
00:15:57.127 --> 00:16:00.128
-I. too. slurp my oatmeal.
-(laughter)

395
00:16:00.197 --> 00:16:03.598
I also look good in a--
in a blue suit.

396
00:16:03.667 --> 00:16:05.700
I'm the Beast. right?
So I accepted that. I was like.

397
00:16:05.769 --> 00:16:07.698
that's who I am. I'm the Beast.
The next time I fucked a dude.

398
00:16:07.767 --> 00:16:09.939
I was like.
"Yeah. kill the Beast!"

399
00:16:10.008 --> 00:16:13.108
Psht! Kill the Beast.
Psht! Be my guest.

400
00:16:13.177 --> 00:16:16.412
Psht! Put this pussy.
Psht! To the test.

401
00:16:16.481 --> 00:16:17.549
Psht! Okay.

402
00:16:18.744 --> 00:16:21.249
-(laughter continues)
-(laughs)

403
00:16:21.318 --> 00:16:23.553
That was for all
the Disney heads.
you know what I'm sayin'?

404
00:16:23.622 --> 00:16:25.190
(humming) Okay.

405
00:16:26.523 --> 00:16:28.423
So. I was like.
I gotta work on myself.

406
00:16:28.492 --> 00:16:30.825
And it's hard because.
you know. I--

407
00:16:30.894 --> 00:16:35.063
You know. I have. obviously.
a great sense of humor. right?

408
00:16:35.132 --> 00:16:36.264
And men. on the dating profiles.

409
00:16:36.333 --> 00:16:37.565
they always say
they want a woman

410
00:16:37.634 --> 00:16:39.400
with a good sense of humor.
They always say that.

411
00:16:39.469 --> 00:16:41.136
"I want a woman--"
But they don't!

412
00:16:41.205 --> 00:16:42.971
Because when men say
they want a woman

413
00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.372
with a good sense of humor.
what they mean

414
00:16:44.441 --> 00:16:46.207
is they want a chick
whose boobs bounce

415
00:16:46.276 --> 00:16:48.478
when she laughs at his jokes.

416
00:16:48.547 --> 00:16:50.245
(laughter. applause)

417
00:16:50.314 --> 00:16:52.514
You see how the men
aren't clapping?

418
00:16:52.583 --> 00:16:54.716
The women are clapping
but the men aren't. okay?

419
00:16:54.785 --> 00:16:57.553
Because that's true.
They're like. "What?
No. come on."

420
00:16:57.622 --> 00:17:00.389
(laughter)

421
00:17:00.458 --> 00:17:02.524
So I was trying to watch-- I've
been trying to watch myself.

422
00:17:02.593 --> 00:17:05.556
I was looking at the last dude
that I was. I was talking to.

423
00:17:05.625 --> 00:17:07.462
I was like. what happened?

424
00:17:07.531 --> 00:17:09.634
And then. I looked at
our old text messages.

425
00:17:11.202 --> 00:17:14.439
This dude goes. "Marcella.
you have a beautiful face."

426
00:17:15.907 --> 00:17:17.472
And my response was.

427
00:17:17.541 --> 00:17:19.908
"I look like my dad.
Are you gay?"

428
00:17:19.977 --> 00:17:22.143
(laughter)

429
00:17:22.212 --> 00:17:24.580
No wonder it didn't work out.

430
00:17:24.649 --> 00:17:26.949
Gee whiz. right?

431
00:17:27.018 --> 00:17:28.383
So. I've been working
on myself. right?

432
00:17:28.452 --> 00:17:30.189
I'm trying to watch
my mouth a little bit.

433
00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:32.855
I'm dating a short guy right now

434
00:17:32.924 --> 00:17:34.423
because I don't have
a choice. right?

435
00:17:34.492 --> 00:17:35.523
(laughter)

436
00:17:35.592 --> 00:17:38.493
He's always asking me
for piggyback rides.

437
00:17:38.562 --> 00:17:41.700
Every time he hugs me. it looks
like a koala bear on a tree.

438
00:17:43.233 --> 00:17:45.433
It's all good.
I like how you guys are like.

439
00:17:45.502 --> 00:17:48.536
-"Come on. give him a chance."
-(laughter)

440
00:17:48.605 --> 00:17:50.072
I did give him a chance.
It's going on for a--

441
00:17:50.141 --> 00:17:51.506
It's been going on
for a minute now.

442
00:17:51.575 --> 00:17:54.877
-and we are in love.
okay? Yes!
-(cheering)

443
00:17:54.946 --> 00:17:56.778
I am in love!

444
00:17:56.847 --> 00:17:59.514
For the first time in my life--
No. wait. let me correct that.

445
00:17:59.583 --> 00:18:02.752
This is the first time
in my life someone
loves me back.

446
00:18:02.821 --> 00:18:04.586
Audience:
Aw...

447
00:18:04.655 --> 00:18:07.655
You see. the girls are like.
"Ooh. I feel that."

448
00:18:07.724 --> 00:18:10.162
You felt that right here.
bitch. huh?

449
00:18:10.895 --> 00:18:13.361
(laughs)

450
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:15.898
And it's been great.
I'm-- I am enjoying it. but I--

451
00:18:15.967 --> 00:18:17.466
So I'm trying to like
watch my mouth.

452
00:18:17.535 --> 00:18:19.902
Not-- You know.
not when it counts.
but you know what I mean?

453
00:18:19.971 --> 00:18:21.336
(laughter)

454
00:18:21.405 --> 00:18:23.138
Like trying to watch what
I say out of my mouth.

455
00:18:23.207 --> 00:18:24.707
now what goes into it. right?

456
00:18:24.776 --> 00:18:26.374
(laughter)

457
00:18:26.443 --> 00:18:28.911
And so.
and the first time we had sex.

458
00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.713
I was trying to be mindful.

459
00:18:30.782 --> 00:18:32.384
and I took off my shirt.

460
00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:34.378
And he--

461
00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:36.652
(laughter)

462
00:18:36.721 --> 00:18:39.154
Bitch. I-- Was that you?

463
00:18:39.223 --> 00:18:41.824
She went. "Okay."

464
00:18:41.893 --> 00:18:43.659
-She taking notes!
-(laughter)

465
00:18:43.728 --> 00:18:44.988
She's like. "Okay."

466
00:18:45.057 --> 00:18:47.630
Are you a bitch. too?
Is that the problem?

467
00:18:47.699 --> 00:18:49.031
Are you trying
to work on yourself

468
00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:50.369
because you're a bitch. too?

469
00:18:51.702 --> 00:18:54.303
-You're fucking sliding
into your chair.
-(laughter)

470
00:18:54.372 --> 00:18:56.066
What happened?
Let's talk about it.

471
00:18:56.135 --> 00:18:57.901
What's wrong with you. girl?
No. just kidding.

472
00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.642
You're a bitch.
That's what it is. Okay.

473
00:18:59.711 --> 00:19:01.476
(laughter)

474
00:19:01.545 --> 00:19:03.845
So. the first time we're having
sex. I take off my shirt.

475
00:19:03.914 --> 00:19:08.050
and he was like. "Marcella.
you have incredible breasts."

476
00:19:08.119 --> 00:19:10.753
-It took all of me...
-(quiet laughter)

477
00:19:10.822 --> 00:19:12.353
not to say...

478
00:19:12.422 --> 00:19:14.722
-"You. too."
-(loud laughter)

479
00:19:14.791 --> 00:19:18.230
-He doesn't need
to hear that shit!
-(applause)

480
00:19:18.796 --> 00:19:20.399
He knows.

481
00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.101
So. I'm trying to watch my mouth
with this dude. He's great.

482
00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:29.471
Yeah. he's great. I love him.
We're a very progressive couple.

483
00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:32.908
Yeah. he's pansexual.
and I am also a hoe. Um...

484
00:19:32.977 --> 00:19:35.543
(laughter. applause)

485
00:19:35.612 --> 00:19:37.416
-Audience member: Woo!
-(laughs)

486
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:40.181
That's funny you wooed
at that. sir.

487
00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:41.250
because I've been watching you.

488
00:19:41.319 --> 00:19:43.384
and you've been
hesitating to laugh.

489
00:19:43.453 --> 00:19:45.086
And then you wooed
that pansexual shit

490
00:19:45.155 --> 00:19:48.423
-because you love to suck
a dick and eat a pussy!
-(cheering)

491
00:19:48.492 --> 00:19:52.695
And! And eat a pussy! I love it!

(sighs. laughs)

497
00:20:06.945 --> 00:20:08.944
(cheering. applause)

498
00:20:09.013 --> 00:20:11.984
No! No excessive clapping.
I don't have time for it.

499
00:20:13.084 --> 00:20:15.883
I gotta focus.

500
00:20:15.952 --> 00:20:18.420
That's your laugh?
That's a good-- Uh! I just--
I'm too--

501
00:20:18.489 --> 00:20:20.956
I have too much ADHD.
When I hear shit. I'm like...

502
00:20:21.025 --> 00:20:22.157
(growls)

503
00:20:22.226 --> 00:20:23.458
Come watch me

504
00:20:23.527 --> 00:20:25.894
so I can make fun
of your laugh! Okay.

505
00:20:25.963 --> 00:20:28.663
Focus. Focus.
Let me get back on track. Okay.

506
00:20:28.732 --> 00:20:31.834
Okay. so we've been going
for a few months now.

507
00:20:31.903 --> 00:20:33.869
Eight-- Eight months.
something like that.

508
00:20:33.938 --> 00:20:35.437
But. like three months into it.

509
00:20:35.506 --> 00:20:37.305
I told my homegirl--
You know. I was all excited.

510
00:20:37.374 --> 00:20:39.641
I was telling my closest
homegirls about it.

511
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:42.443
and one of my homegirls
who's known me for a long time.
she was like.

512
00:20:42.512 --> 00:20:44.279
"Marcella. you need
move in with him!"

513
00:20:44.348 --> 00:20:46.648
And I was like. "Whoa!

514
00:20:46.717 --> 00:20:48.083
Relax."

515
00:20:48.152 --> 00:20:50.352
You know. like.
I'm trying to go slow.

516
00:20:50.421 --> 00:20:51.653
And she was like. "Marcella.

517
00:20:51.722 --> 00:20:53.555
"I just know you've dealt
with so many fuck-boys.

518
00:20:53.624 --> 00:20:55.391
and you're not getting
any younger." And I was like.

519
00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.025
"Okay. relax again."

520
00:20:57.094 --> 00:20:58.627
(laughter)

521
00:20:58.696 --> 00:20:59.990
-I'm not...
-Member: Going too far.

522
00:21:00.059 --> 00:21:03.165
-Yeah. going too far!
-(laughter)

523
00:21:03.234 --> 00:21:04.366
And I just went.
"You know what. girl?

524
00:21:04.435 --> 00:21:06.634
I'm just not trying
to ruin things. right?"

525
00:21:06.703 --> 00:21:08.164
And she goes.
"Don't worry. Marcella.

526
00:21:08.233 --> 00:21:11.206
It'll get ruined
because everything gets ruined."

527
00:21:11.275 --> 00:21:12.907
(groaning laughter)

528
00:21:12.976 --> 00:21:15.978
I was like.
"Damn. you're single?
Who would've guessed?"

529
00:21:16.047 --> 00:21:17.312
(laughter)

530
00:21:17.381 --> 00:21:19.048
Who the fuck says that shit.
right? I was like.

531
00:21:19.117 --> 00:21:20.916
"You know what?
I got somebody
I want you to meet."

532
00:21:20.985 --> 00:21:21.984
She was like. "Really? Who?"

533
00:21:22.053 --> 00:21:23.985
I was like. "My therapist.
you fuckin' bitch."

534
00:21:24.054 --> 00:21:25.187
Who--

535
00:21:25.256 --> 00:21:27.856
Who says that to someone
who's newly in love?

536
00:21:27.925 --> 00:21:30.493
(applause)

537
00:21:30.562 --> 00:21:31.627
But it's hard. right?

538
00:21:31.696 --> 00:21:33.562
To try to change
and to focus on it

539
00:21:33.631 --> 00:21:36.331
because then you also start
to internalize your fuck-ups.

540
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.633
Right? You feel terrible.

541
00:21:38.702 --> 00:21:41.936
I once was going
to my homegirl's house.

542
00:21:42.005 --> 00:21:43.972
I shouldn't say homegirl 'cause
we're not super good friends.

543
00:21:44.041 --> 00:21:46.508
My friend Teresa.
she's a beautiful Asian girl.

544
00:21:46.577 --> 00:21:49.410
right? And. like.
we've kicked it before.

545
00:21:49.479 --> 00:21:52.614
so I know what she looks like.

546
00:21:52.683 --> 00:21:55.385
But then. I'm walking up
to her house.

547
00:21:55.454 --> 00:21:58.153
and I see her.

548
00:21:58.222 --> 00:22:01.456
and I'm about to be like.
"Hey. girl! What's up?" Right?

549
00:22:01.525 --> 00:22:04.793
And I'm right here.
I'm right at. "He..."

550
00:22:04.862 --> 00:22:06.028
(laughter)

551
00:22:06.097 --> 00:22:07.662
I'm like... (squeaks)

552
00:22:07.731 --> 00:22:11.633
And I realize that
she's not looking at me

553
00:22:11.702 --> 00:22:14.370
with the same familiar eyes...

554
00:22:14.439 --> 00:22:16.404
that I'm looking at her.

555
00:22:16.473 --> 00:22:19.308
And I was like. "He-- Oh...

556
00:22:19.377 --> 00:22:22.677
-"I'm a racist. Oh. my God."
-(laughter)

557
00:22:22.746 --> 00:22:25.681
"I think all Asians
look alike. Sandra Oh no."

558
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:27.582
(laughter)

559
00:22:27.651 --> 00:22:30.152
"I'm a racist. Oh. my-- I think
all Asians look like this--

560
00:22:30.221 --> 00:22:31.954
Oh my-- This is terrible."

561
00:22:32.023 --> 00:22:33.689
I'm str-- I have all these
intrusive thoughts.

562
00:22:33.758 --> 00:22:35.891
and as I'm having
these thoughts.

563
00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.325
the girl. she looks at me.
she's like.

564
00:22:37.394 --> 00:22:39.260
"Are you Marcella?
I'm Teresa's twin sister."

565
00:22:39.329 --> 00:22:41.297
-I was like. twins!
-(laughter)

566
00:22:41.366 --> 00:22:45.133
(applause)

567
00:22:45.202 --> 00:22:47.439
That's a racist's
worst nightmare!

568
00:22:48.805 --> 00:22:51.043
You gotta let a bitch know
when you're twins.

569
00:22:53.444 --> 00:22:56.078
It's hard trying to be
a better person.

570
00:22:56.147 --> 00:22:57.813
But here's what I do like.

571
00:22:57.882 --> 00:23:00.315
I do like the music
on the radio right now

572
00:23:00.384 --> 00:23:02.852
with all the rap girlies.
I love it.

573
00:23:02.921 --> 00:23:06.321
Megan. Cardi. Doja.
Saweetie. the City Girls.

574
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:08.758
I love all of it.
Latto. I love all of it.

575
00:23:08.827 --> 00:23:10.691
I'm so happy these girls
are on the radio.

576
00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.695
and they're-- but they're always
rapping about broke dudes

577
00:23:13.764 --> 00:23:16.331
or shitting on broke dudes.
right? Cardi had that one song.

578
00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.634
-"Broke boys don't
deserve no pussy."
-Audience: I know that's right!

579
00:23:19.703 --> 00:23:22.833
-Brainwashed.
You see these bitches?
-(laughter)

580
00:23:22.902 --> 00:23:24.573
Fucking brainwashed.

581
00:23:24.642 --> 00:23:25.874
That shit ain't right.

582
00:23:25.943 --> 00:23:28.743
That's classism. girl!
That's elitism!

583
00:23:28.812 --> 00:23:30.578
And here's the fucked-up part.
They never tell you

584
00:23:30.647 --> 00:23:33.052
why you shouldn't
fuck a broke dude.

585
00:23:34.751 --> 00:23:36.919
Does anybody know why you
shouldn't fuck a broke dude?

586
00:23:36.988 --> 00:23:38.987
(indistinct suggestions)

587
00:23:39.056 --> 00:23:41.022
They got the best dick.

588
00:23:41.091 --> 00:23:42.958
(cheers. laughter)

589
00:23:43.027 --> 00:23:44.960
They got the--
Broke dudes got the best dick.

590
00:23:45.029 --> 00:23:47.163
That's facts.
I've done the research.

591
00:23:47.232 --> 00:23:50.800
(laughter)

592
00:23:50.869 --> 00:23:52.034
And why do they have
the best dick?

593
00:23:52.103 --> 00:23:54.403
Because they've been
sleeping all day...

594
00:23:54.472 --> 00:23:55.905
(laughter)

595
00:23:55.974 --> 00:23:59.174
then they fuck
the shit out of you!

596
00:23:59.243 --> 00:24:02.578
And your stupid young ass
is like. "There was a spark."

597
00:24:02.647 --> 00:24:04.679
-(laughter)
-(sighs)

598
00:24:04.748 --> 00:24:07.282
Like. that wasn't a spark. girl.
He's just well-rested.

599
00:24:07.351 --> 00:24:09.150
-(laughter)
-Right?

600
00:24:09.219 --> 00:24:11.887
"Like. you don't understand.
We had romantic shower sex."

601
00:24:11.956 --> 00:24:14.357
Bitch. he needed
to take a shower.

602
00:24:14.426 --> 00:24:16.291
(laughter)

603
00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.727
"Marcella.
you don't understand.

604
00:24:17.796 --> 00:24:18.928
In the morning.
he made me coffee."

605
00:24:18.997 --> 00:24:21.864
Girl. he is
a 46-year-old barista.

606
00:24:21.933 --> 00:24:23.568
(laughter)

607
00:24:24.169 --> 00:24:25.534
(laughs)

608
00:24:25.603 --> 00:24:27.335
Look. I'm not saying
don't fuck them.

609
00:24:27.404 --> 00:24:31.072
Just don't fall for them.
That's what I'm saying. right?

610
00:24:31.141 --> 00:24:33.375
'Cause they either
fuck you right
or they pay all your bills.

611
00:24:33.444 --> 00:24:35.378
-It's never both.
-(laughter)

612
00:24:35.447 --> 00:24:37.680
Because if it's both...

613
00:24:37.749 --> 00:24:40.585
-he's cheating on you.
-(laughter)

614
00:24:42.652 --> 00:24:44.653
Yeah. but I've been
trying to grow up.

615
00:24:44.722 --> 00:24:46.989
get better.
be a better person.

616
00:24:47.058 --> 00:24:48.351
And. uh. it's hard.

617
00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:49.958
But I always think about
how I was as a kid.

618
00:24:50.027 --> 00:24:51.894
You guys remember
the DARE program?

619
00:24:51.963 --> 00:24:53.523
Guys. remember the DARE program?
Oh. my God.

620
00:24:53.592 --> 00:24:55.430
I love the DARE program.
For those that don't remember.

621
00:24:55.499 --> 00:24:57.332
the DARE program
was a program.

622
00:24:57.401 --> 00:25:00.602
an abstinence--
an abstinence-only...

623
00:25:00.671 --> 00:25:04.106
Wait. A drug and alcohol
resistance program.

624
00:25:04.175 --> 00:25:06.845
Right? Just taught you
to say no. That's all it was.

625
00:25:07.545 --> 00:25:09.878
And I fucking loved it.

626
00:25:09.947 --> 00:25:13.181
I-- When I was a kid.
I loved being good.

627
00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:16.384
I love getting straight A's.
I loved being a snitch.

628
00:25:16.453 --> 00:25:18.587
-I loved it.
-(laughter)

629
00:25:18.656 --> 00:25:21.689
My siblings fuckin' hated me.

630
00:25:21.758 --> 00:25:24.059
I was like. "Listen.
I'm not here to make friends."

631
00:25:24.128 --> 00:25:25.094
(laughter)

632
00:25:25.163 --> 00:25:28.000
"They feed me
and buy me toys! Come on!"

633
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.200
And I loved the DARE program.
It was built for me. I loved it.

634
00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:35.170
And I loved. "Say no to drugs."
I loved being good.

635
00:25:35.239 --> 00:25:38.040
And. uh. I actually...

636
00:25:38.109 --> 00:25:39.841
(laughs) I don't know
if you remember.

637
00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:42.444
at the end of the DARE program.
you wrote an essay

638
00:25:42.513 --> 00:25:45.108
about why you love
the DARE program.

639
00:25:45.177 --> 00:25:46.147
Girl. my essay was so good.

640
00:25:46.216 --> 00:25:48.984
I got to read it
in front of the whole school.

641
00:25:49.053 --> 00:25:49.952
(laughter)

642
00:25:50.021 --> 00:25:52.888
Yeah. That's how good
it was. okay?

643
00:25:52.957 --> 00:25:54.890
I was so proud.
My mom was so proud.

644
00:25:54.959 --> 00:25:57.659
My mom was so proud of me.
she framed it

645
00:25:57.728 --> 00:26:00.162
and had it hanging
by the front door.

646
00:26:00.231 --> 00:26:02.231
Right. but. yeah. Adorable.
Yeah. You leave the house.

647
00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.567
and it was right there.
Every time I left. I was like.

648
00:26:04.636 --> 00:26:05.934
-"Mm..."
-(laughter)

649
00:26:06.003 --> 00:26:07.335
And then I think back. I'm like.

650
00:26:07.404 --> 00:26:08.704
no wonder my siblings hated me.

651
00:26:08.773 --> 00:26:10.205
You know. like. how annoying.

652
00:26:10.274 --> 00:26:11.841
But whatever.
you know?

653
00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:14.276
I was proud of myself.
I loved it.

654
00:26:14.345 --> 00:26:15.915
And then. I grew up.

655
00:26:17.381 --> 00:26:20.710
I started drinking at 21.
which is good. That's good.

656
00:26:20.779 --> 00:26:23.646
-I started smoking weed
around 24. right?
-(lone laugh)

657
00:26:23.715 --> 00:26:26.189
And-- I don't like the way
you laughed at that. ma'am.

658
00:26:26.258 --> 00:26:28.424
(laughter)

659
00:26:28.493 --> 00:26:30.125
Damn... Your laughter.

660
00:26:30.194 --> 00:26:32.160
you just called me a virgin
with that laughter.

661
00:26:32.229 --> 00:26:33.765
I don't like that.

662
00:26:34.599 --> 00:26:36.498
And so.

663
00:26:36.567 --> 00:26:38.100
uh. the first time I got high.

664
00:26:38.169 --> 00:26:41.103
I went back to my mother's
house. my parents' house.

665
00:26:41.172 --> 00:26:42.938
and I was high as shit.

666
00:26:43.007 --> 00:26:44.439
and I was trying to hide it.

667
00:26:44.508 --> 00:26:46.774
Like. looking down
and shit. you know.

668
00:26:46.843 --> 00:26:49.044
And parents. they--
if there's parents of kids here.

669
00:26:49.113 --> 00:26:51.213
you know. You know when
something is up with your kid.

670
00:26:51.282 --> 00:26:54.249
You know when they're happy.
sad. when something's up.

671
00:26:54.318 --> 00:26:55.317
when something's bothering them.

672
00:26:55.386 --> 00:26:57.385
when they wanna talk
about something. you know.

673
00:26:57.454 --> 00:27:00.889
So. my mom knew
since I walked in
that something was up. right?

674
00:27:00.958 --> 00:27:03.091
But she-- but I was looking all.
you know. I was. like.

675
00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.993
not trying to look at her.
And she-- she's 5'8".

676
00:27:05.062 --> 00:27:06.762
so she was trying
to get up under me. She's like.

677
00:27:06.831 --> 00:27:08.833
-qué te pasa . Marcella?
-(laughter)

678
00:27:10.168 --> 00:27:12.400
Qué te pasa. Marcella?

679
00:27:12.469 --> 00:27:14.970
Ey. Marcella. qué te pasa?

680
00:27:15.039 --> 00:27:16.472
Marcella. qué te pasa.
Marcella?

681
00:27:16.541 --> 00:27:18.106
(clicking tongue)

682
00:27:18.175 --> 00:27:19.575
(laughter)

683
00:27:19.644 --> 00:27:20.913
Qué te pasa?

684
00:27:22.714 --> 00:27:23.979
And I don't lie.
I've never lied.

685
00:27:24.048 --> 00:27:26.682
I've always been a good kid.
so I don't lie.

686
00:27:26.751 --> 00:27:29.188
So. on her sixth qué te pasa.

687
00:27:30.421 --> 00:27:32.120
I told my mother.

688
00:27:32.189 --> 00:27:34.990
-"I am high on marijuana!"
-(laughter)

689
00:27:35.059 --> 00:27:38.297
That's how I said it.
"I am high on marijuana."

690
00:27:40.164 --> 00:27:43.198
And she was upset.
Yeah. And-and--

691
00:27:43.267 --> 00:27:45.600
You know. she got me in trouble.
I went to my room.

692
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:47.002
And in the morning.
when I got up.

693
00:27:47.071 --> 00:27:49.304
I was too ashamed to. like. go--
like. go say good morning.

694
00:27:49.373 --> 00:27:50.873
None of that shit.
I didn't do none of that.

695
00:27:50.942 --> 00:27:52.407
I just. like.
snuck out of the house.

696
00:27:52.476 --> 00:27:54.877
and as I was sneaking out of
the house to get breakfast.

697
00:27:54.946 --> 00:27:57.680
I noticed that the essay...

698
00:27:57.749 --> 00:27:59.682
Audience:
Aw...

699
00:27:59.751 --> 00:28:01.987
...was taken down.
It was gone.

700
00:28:03.421 --> 00:28:06.354
You know. Latinos. we don't.
like. talk about our problems

701
00:28:06.423 --> 00:28:07.723
or what's bothering us.

702
00:28:07.792 --> 00:28:10.125
So I had never mentioned it.

703
00:28:10.194 --> 00:28:12.428
I was like.
"She-- she not wrong."

704
00:28:12.497 --> 00:28:14.166
(laughter)

705
00:28:15.467 --> 00:28:18.166
And then. a month ago.

706
00:28:18.235 --> 00:28:20.836
I heard her moving
something. like. in the back.

707
00:28:20.905 --> 00:28:23.205
and I hear something
fall and break.

708
00:28:23.274 --> 00:28:25.468
Like. something crashes.

709
00:28:25.537 --> 00:28:27.479
And I just hear.
"Oh. sorry. Marcella."

710
00:28:28.613 --> 00:28:29.879
And I was like. what?

711
00:28:29.948 --> 00:28:31.880
And it was the DARE essay.

712
00:28:31.949 --> 00:28:33.315
She had saved it.

713
00:28:33.384 --> 00:28:35.451
So I brought it here
to read to you guys.

714
00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.820
(applause)

715
00:28:37.889 --> 00:28:40.389
So... Look at that.

716
00:28:40.458 --> 00:28:43.195
(cheering)

717
00:28:44.829 --> 00:28:46.862
The stationery.
This is the original.

718
00:28:46.931 --> 00:28:49.431
The cardstock. It's legit.

719
00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.427
Okay.

720
00:28:51.496 --> 00:28:53.669
"I promise
to say no to drugs..."

721
00:28:53.738 --> 00:28:54.837
(laughter)

722
00:28:54.906 --> 00:28:57.406
"because of the everyday things
I wanna do.

723
00:28:57.475 --> 00:28:59.442
Breathe and stay alive."

724
00:28:59.511 --> 00:29:01.043
(laughter)

725
00:29:01.112 --> 00:29:04.213
"Drugs are something
I will never do.

726
00:29:04.282 --> 00:29:07.616
"Drugs aren't just
flashy things.
They are deadly things.

727
00:29:07.685 --> 00:29:09.051
"If you think drugs are cool

728
00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.687
"because famous people like
models and TV stars use them.

729
00:29:11.756 --> 00:29:13.449
you think wrong." All capital.

730
00:29:13.518 --> 00:29:15.691
-"You think wrong."
-(laughter)

731
00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:18.560
"I promise again
to say no to drugs.

732
00:29:18.629 --> 00:29:20.029
"The only way
I can keep my promise

733
00:29:20.098 --> 00:29:22.131
"is to pick good friends.
people I trust.

734
00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.132
"and great adults
that I can depend on.

735
00:29:24.201 --> 00:29:25.834
"If I didn't have
all those people.

736
00:29:25.903 --> 00:29:27.703
who knows where
I'd be right now?"

737
00:29:27.772 --> 00:29:29.305
I'm 10.

738
00:29:29.374 --> 00:29:31.572
(laughter)

739
00:29:31.641 --> 00:29:34.877
"The promise is very important
to keep because of cancer.

740
00:29:34.946 --> 00:29:36.712
-AIDS..."
-(audience groaning)

741
00:29:36.781 --> 00:29:39.515
It was the '90s.
"Cancer. AIDS.

742
00:29:39.584 --> 00:29:41.016
"and a lot of deadly things.

743
00:29:41.085 --> 00:29:43.919
"If everyone knew about this
and cared about themselves.

744
00:29:43.988 --> 00:29:46.755
"no one would be
buying drugs today.

745
00:29:46.824 --> 00:29:48.523
"My goals are never.
ever to use drugs.

746
00:29:48.592 --> 00:29:50.826
but that will be hard
because all of the pressure."

747
00:29:50.895 --> 00:29:52.160
(laughter)

748
00:29:52.229 --> 00:29:53.863
"My other goals
are to become a teacher

749
00:29:53.932 --> 00:29:56.226
and to have
a lovely drug-free family."

750
00:29:56.295 --> 00:29:57.660
Audience:
Aw...

751
00:29:57.729 --> 00:29:59.534
"The most fun thing
I did in DARE was acting

752
00:29:59.603 --> 00:30:01.871
"and learning all about drugs.

756
00:30:10.475 --> 00:30:12.384
So I wrote a little response.

757
00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:16.417
-"You dumb little bitch."
-(laughter)

758
00:30:16.486 --> 00:30:20.388
"You broke your promise
and your mother's heart.

"First of all.
you really should take a break

Drugs are great."

"And life is hard.

"Drugs can get you
through the day

767
00:30:37.675 --> 00:30:39.775
or help you sleep at night.
and they even clear your skin."

768

-That's true.

"Additionally. the DARE program
will end very soon

777

ineffective."

"Look. in 'Parable of the

"So. little me.
it's time to start changing
