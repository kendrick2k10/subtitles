00:01:28.261 --> 00:01:29.261
Hello. Tom.

4
00:01:47.037 --> 00:01:47.981
What's this for?

5
00:01:47.983 --> 00:01:49.936
I can't Bury him if he ain't dead.

6
00:01:52.123 --> 00:01:53.514
You mean he pulled through?

7
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:55.770
I'll be damned.

8
00:01:56.391 --> 00:01:58.853
He's not there. The sheriff's office.

9
00:02:15.102 --> 00:02:16.269
I'll be damned.

10
00:02:18.324 --> 00:02:19.324
You're alive.

11
00:02:22.074 --> 00:02:24.232
What in god's name
happened to you out there?

12
00:02:25.191 --> 00:02:28.454
Yankee bullets. Tried to snuff us out.

13
00:02:30.494 --> 00:02:32.550
There ain't no
Yankees around these parts.

14
00:02:33.592 --> 00:02:34.981
How long were you
wandering around out there

15
00:02:34.983 --> 00:02:36.069
all wounded and such?

16
00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:39.780
There ain't not telling.

17
00:02:41.501 --> 00:02:43.794
Yeah. I'm not sure how
long you was laying there

18
00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:45.410
before I stumbled across you.

19
00:02:46.827 --> 00:02:47.827
Luckily I did.

20
00:02:48.697 --> 00:02:50.276
Beat the coyotes and the wolves.

21
00:02:52.731 --> 00:02:54.070
Will you get me out of here?

22
00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.765
I guess I could go have
a word with the sheriff.

23
00:02:58.767 --> 00:02:59.767
see what I can do.

24
00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.934
First you can to tell me

25
00:03:01.936 --> 00:03:03.780
a little bit about the battle you was in?

26
00:03:05.668 --> 00:03:07.442
Well we had the Yankees on the run.

27
00:03:08.603 --> 00:03:09.706
That's for damned sure.

28
00:03:13.315 --> 00:03:16.632
Hell. they didn't know whether
to scratch their watches

29
00:03:16.634 --> 00:03:19.619
or wind their asses.

30
00:03:21.074 --> 00:03:22.704
Where do you call home. soldier?

31
00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.780
San antone.

32
00:03:28.622 --> 00:03:33.417
San Antonio. Woo-wee. you
is a long way from home.

33
00:03:35.776 --> 00:03:37.699
Alright. I'll go see if I
can track down the sheriff

34
00:03:37.701 --> 00:03:39.064
and see if we can get you out of here.

35
00:03:39.066 --> 00:03:41.250
And if I can. I'll give you a coin

36
00:03:41.252 --> 00:03:43.609
and you can hop a train to vicksburg.

37
00:03:43.611 --> 00:03:46.937
From there. you can catch a buckwagon

38
00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:49.052
or a stagecoach on down to Texas.

39
00:03:50.181 --> 00:03:52.049
- Much obliged.
- Yeah.

40
00:03:52.051 --> 00:03:53.631
When you get there. you tell the men

41
00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:55.360
if Jeff Davis wants to win this war.

42
00:03:56.434 --> 00:03:57.799
he's gonna need more texans.

43
00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:00.810
Alright.

44
00:04:02.418 --> 00:04:03.418
Sit tight.

45
00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:02.158
Give me two.

46
00:05:10.377 --> 00:05:11.496
Here you go.

47
00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:16.392
Morning. huck.

48
00:05:17.348 --> 00:05:18.428
What do you say there. Jim?

49
00:05:19.161 --> 00:05:20.986
- I say whiskey.
- Rye?

50
00:05:22.105 --> 00:05:25.004
- Bourbon.
- Spoken like a true irishman.

51
00:05:32.572 --> 00:05:33.572
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

52
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.780
- How's you?
- How's you?

53
00:05:45.782 --> 00:05:47.141
A tall whiskey.

54
00:05:52.553 --> 00:05:53.673
Here you go.

55
00:06:00.628 --> 00:06:01.628
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

56
00:06:08.695 --> 00:06:10.357
So. you on leave?

57
00:06:12.263 --> 00:06:13.845
I'm on leave from cutting dust.

58
00:06:14.679 --> 00:06:16.217
I meant leave from the army.

59
00:06:20.627 --> 00:06:22.572
There ain't no army for me no more.

60
00:06:24.468 --> 00:06:25.468
Are you a cripple?

61
00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:30.055
I ain't a cripple.

62
00:06:31.396 --> 00:06:33.312
Took a couple of yankee bullets.

63
00:06:33.314 --> 00:06:34.752
busted my leg some years back.

64
00:06:37.133 --> 00:06:41.444
So are you gonna let that stand?

65
00:06:41.446 --> 00:06:42.504
Yankee bullets?

66
00:06:44.663 --> 00:06:47.208
Them boys up north are just
doing what they were told.

67
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.457
It ain't nothing personal.

68
00:06:50.771 --> 00:06:51.568
What the hell?

69
00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:53.130
What the hell is wrong with people?

70
00:06:54.182 --> 00:06:55.216
You just ain't got the stomach for it.

71
00:06:55.218 --> 00:06:56.731
That's what it is.

72
00:06:56.733 --> 00:06:59.187
Let me tell you. old Jeff
Davis and general Lee.

73
00:06:59.189 --> 00:07:01.306
they're gonna need every
able bodied man they can get

74
00:07:01.308 --> 00:07:03.408
if we're gonna pull them off this miracle.

75
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:04.410
God damn.

76
00:07:05.544 --> 00:07:08.987
If you're so eager to fight.
take a rifle. head east.

77
00:07:12.097 --> 00:07:12.894
You know I would.

78
00:07:12.896 --> 00:07:15.711
except for I got these flat feet.

79
00:07:15.713 --> 00:07:18.271
so they probably wouldn't even let me.

80
00:07:18.273 --> 00:07:20.151
You know what? Don't. don't...

81
00:07:20.153 --> 00:07:21.571
You believe this fella?

82
00:07:21.573 --> 00:07:22.654
He's scared of battle.

83
00:07:22.656 --> 00:07:24.526
I've got no quarrel with you. mister.

84
00:07:25.916 --> 00:07:28.121
But if you think I'm going
to go back and get shot

85
00:07:28.123 --> 00:07:30.415
so a plantation owner
can own more slaves...

86
00:07:34.251 --> 00:07:36.934
Blasphemy. God damned blasphemy.

87
00:07:36.936 --> 00:07:39.258
How dare you talk about
your homeland like that!

88
00:07:47.697 --> 00:07:50.951
Skin it. or else I say we're done here.

89
00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:53.530
Yeah?

90
00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:55.986
Just take it easy. boys.

91
00:07:58.275 --> 00:07:59.136
If you two want to kill one another.

92
00:07:59.138 --> 00:08:01.318
kindly draw a line out in the street.

93
00:08:22.836 --> 00:08:23.894
Sorry. huck.

94
00:08:25.466 --> 00:08:28.373
This damned war's got everyone
on one side or the other.

95
00:08:31.429 --> 00:08:32.429
Appears so.

96
00:08:34.086 --> 00:08:36.577
Not to stoke the fire. but I heard

97
00:08:36.579 --> 00:08:39.776
a man named beauregard
stopped in here last night.

98
00:08:41.537 --> 00:08:42.629
Sounds familiar.

99
00:08:42.631 --> 00:08:45.597
It's arliss beauregard.

100
00:08:45.599 --> 00:08:47.085
He took a room down at the inn.

101
00:08:47.963 --> 00:08:51.409
He says that there are rumors
that Lee might surrender.

102
00:08:52.691 --> 00:08:53.825
- Surrender?
- Yeah.

103
00:08:54.875 --> 00:08:57.464
He says he's down here
recruiting soldiers from Texas.

104
00:08:59.634 --> 00:09:01.552
He's probably looking for funding.

105
00:09:01.554 --> 00:09:02.561
in case Lee bows out.

106
00:09:06.031 --> 00:09:07.760
- Thanks for the heads up.
- You bet.

107
00:09:11.335 --> 00:09:13.519
I'm gonna skin out and lay low.

108
00:09:13.521 --> 00:09:15.202
- See you later.
- Alright. huck.

109
00:09:59.546 --> 00:10:01.161
Buenos noches. Como estas?

110
00:10:01.163 --> 00:10:05.065
Buenos noches. mi amigo.
Estoy bien. gracias.

111
00:10:05.067 --> 00:10:07.398
And I see your Spanish is improving.

112
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.400
Well. I'm trying.

113
00:10:09.158 --> 00:10:10.993
I don't know how you Mexicans do it.

114
00:10:12.167 --> 00:10:13.833
What can I get you?

115
00:10:13.835 --> 00:10:15.562
One cerveza and a bourbon. please.

116
00:10:17.432 --> 00:10:19.014
Clear off this table over here.

117
00:10:33.625 --> 00:10:35.185
I am parched.

118
00:10:35.187 --> 00:10:36.187
I am too.

119
00:10:43.249 --> 00:10:44.393
Here you go.

120
00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:48.234
One beer. and one bourbon.

121
00:10:48.236 --> 00:10:49.236
Gracias. mi amigo.

122
00:10:50.394 --> 00:10:52.895
Well howdy. miss Marisol.
How are you doing today?

123
00:10:52.897 --> 00:10:53.694
I am well.

124
00:10:53.696 --> 00:10:54.696
Thank you for asking.

125
00:10:55.774 --> 00:10:58.141
So. what brings you to San antone?

126
00:10:58.143 --> 00:11:00.812
Supplies for my ranch.
and medicine for the cows.

127
00:11:01.691 --> 00:11:04.063
You can't get that
sort of thing in laredo?

128
00:11:38.058 --> 00:11:39.058
Evening.

129
00:11:39.784 --> 00:11:42.923
What's a fellow gotta do to get
a decent drink in this town?

130
00:11:45.577 --> 00:11:46.577
What'll it be?

131
00:11:47.322 --> 00:11:48.521
Bourbon. if you please.

132
00:11:57.806 --> 00:12:00.239
Trust you found your
room to your liking?

133
00:12:00.241 --> 00:12:01.260
Fine. thanks.

134
00:12:04.259 --> 00:12:08.397
I'm gonna spend the day
looking for volunteers.

135
00:12:08.399 --> 00:12:11.076
Where might a man looking
for soldiers to enlist

136
00:12:11.078 --> 00:12:14.073
begin such a search in your fine town?

137
00:12:15.048 --> 00:12:16.106
Volunteers?

138
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:22.790
Why. yes.

139
00:12:23.545 --> 00:12:26.248
Able bodied men looking
to fight the good fight

140
00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:27.250
against the north.

141
00:12:28.935 --> 00:12:30.566
I was not aware of any shortage.

142
00:12:32.733 --> 00:12:35.426
If Lee surrenders.
we're all gonna be needing

143
00:12:35.428 --> 00:12:38.332
to finance a war against the north.

144
00:12:38.334 --> 00:12:41.094
In fact. I'm sweeping
through Texas right now

145
00:12:41.096 --> 00:12:43.391
looking for young men that wish to enlist.

146
00:12:45.172 --> 00:12:46.172
The south.

147
00:12:47.112 --> 00:12:49.927
You know the south has always
been outgunned and outmanned.

148
00:12:49.929 --> 00:12:54.386
Well. we might not be as
industrialized as the north.

149
00:12:54.388 --> 00:12:56.371
but we have spirit.

150
00:12:56.373 --> 00:12:59.119
I'm sorry. I must have missed your name.

151
00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:03.013
Ramiro garza. This
is my daughter Marisol.

152
00:13:05.006 --> 00:13:06.013
Lovely to meet you.

153
00:13:11.259 --> 00:13:14.195
Arliss beauregard at your pleasure.

154
00:13:16.034 --> 00:13:17.787
Finance an army. you say?

155
00:13:17.789 --> 00:13:19.959
Should Lee tuck his tail and run.

156
00:13:21.222 --> 00:13:23.495
Well. let's pray that
it don't come to that.

157
00:13:25.237 --> 00:13:26.735
Well. my daughter and I
will be staying the night.

158
00:13:26.737 --> 00:13:28.758
so let's meet back here tonight

159
00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.113
and we'll discuss what you're
looking for in private.

160
00:13:32.625 --> 00:13:33.625
Very well.

161
00:13:36.519 --> 00:13:37.519
Say 10 o'clock?

162
00:13:38.878 --> 00:13:39.878
Until then.

163
00:13:40.761 --> 00:13:42.290
Until then.

164
00:13:42.292 --> 00:13:43.292
Evening. sir.

165
00:13:44.639 --> 00:13:45.639
My lady.

166
00:14:02.816 --> 00:14:03.816
Excuse me.

167
00:14:05.184 --> 00:14:06.247
Evening.

168
00:14:06.249 --> 00:14:07.640
Can you help me find these?

169
00:14:15.715 --> 00:14:17.381
I can get that ready by tomorrow.

170
00:14:17.383 --> 00:14:18.678
first thing in the morning.

171
00:14:20.081 --> 00:14:21.081
Thank you.

172
00:14:22.716 --> 00:14:23.850
That man in the bar.

173
00:14:26.005 --> 00:14:27.005
who was he?

174
00:14:27.897 --> 00:14:30.615
Oh. Something "beauregard."

175
00:14:34.637 --> 00:14:35.637
What'd he want?

176
00:14:36.948 --> 00:14:40.637
He mentioned the war.
and looking for young men.

177
00:14:42.856 --> 00:14:44.350
To enlist?

178
00:14:44.352 --> 00:14:45.352
I think so.

179
00:14:47.277 --> 00:14:49.531
He said something about
Lee and the war ending.

180
00:14:52.082 --> 00:14:53.082
What about you?

181
00:14:53.791 --> 00:14:56.107
What do you think of these
americanos fighting a war?

182
00:14:59.046 --> 00:15:00.059
Hard for me to believe you can use

183
00:15:00.061 --> 00:15:02.410
the words "civil" and
"war" in the same sentence.

184
00:15:04.607 --> 00:15:05.971
The real problem is sin.

185
00:15:09.037 --> 00:15:11.003
Man is always trying to kill one another.

186
00:15:13.014 --> 00:15:15.074
Have you ever heard of the
story of Cain and able?

187
00:15:15.076 --> 00:15:16.275
In the Bible.

188
00:15:18.522 --> 00:15:20.012
We're a fallen people.

189
00:15:22.547 --> 00:15:26.019
"Life. Liberty."

190
00:15:28.659 --> 00:15:29.933
those words don't hold up much

191
00:15:29.935 --> 00:15:31.757
unless you're willing to work for 'em.

192
00:15:33.682 --> 00:15:35.452
Thomas Jefferson said that. yes?

193
00:15:39.449 --> 00:15:42.549
Yeah. that's right. You're educated.

194
00:15:44.464 --> 00:15:45.464
Of course.

195
00:15:47.668 --> 00:15:49.253
I didn't mean to insult.

196
00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:52.810
It's just you being a Mexican and all.

197
00:15:52.812 --> 00:15:54.460
you sure know a lot about our history.

198
00:15:56.241 --> 00:15:59.912
Those words. how can they not mean them

199
00:15:59.914 --> 00:16:01.833
when American kill each other over them?

200
00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:05.566
They just got a different
way of doing it. that's all.

201
00:16:08.193 --> 00:16:11.202
The south's fortune is tied
up in slave labor. and.

202
00:16:14.137 --> 00:16:16.130
well. they'd rather sacrifice

203
00:16:16.132 --> 00:16:17.871
human lives for personal wealth.

204
00:16:19.738 --> 00:16:21.752
But the north didn't invent slaves either.

205
00:16:23.507 --> 00:16:27.372
The hebrews in Egypt.
los indios. espanoles.

206
00:16:30.498 --> 00:16:31.697
no one's hands are clean.

207
00:16:32.618 --> 00:16:34.008
You know your history. too.

208
00:16:37.068 --> 00:16:39.708
Well. to move forward you've
got to understand the past.

209
00:16:44.433 --> 00:16:47.243
I'll get that list to you the
first thing in the morning.

210
00:16:47.245 --> 00:16:48.636
- Muchas gracias.
- De nada.

211
00:16:58.483 --> 00:16:59.689
What?

212
00:16:59.691 --> 00:17:02.145
Well. gentlemen. the
rooster crows mighty early

213
00:17:02.147 --> 00:17:02.943
this time of the year.

214
00:17:02.945 --> 00:17:04.432
I'm gonna call it a night.

215
00:17:05.916 --> 00:17:06.916
Evening. sir.

216
00:17:08.054 --> 00:17:09.894
Welcome to San Antonio.

217
00:17:09.896 --> 00:17:11.766
- Buenos noches. senor.
- Buenos noches.

218
00:17:15.285 --> 00:17:16.286
He's too old.

219
00:17:18.421 --> 00:17:19.724
Yep.

220
00:17:19.726 --> 00:17:24.461
You know. those blue
belly sons of bitches.

221
00:17:24.463 --> 00:17:28.135
all those damned Yankees
above the Mason-Dixon

222
00:17:28.137 --> 00:17:30.849
have proven to be much more resilient

223
00:17:30.851 --> 00:17:32.273
than we first had thought.

224
00:17:33.996 --> 00:17:37.663
The south needs money. money and guns.

225
00:17:38.791 --> 00:17:42.386
because if we're gonna
preserve our way of life.

226
00:17:42.388 --> 00:17:45.906
it's gotta be a true
all-hands-on-deck approach

227
00:17:45.908 --> 00:17:47.282
for the rest of the war.

228
00:17:49.149 --> 00:17:51.786
So I take it that recruiting
is not going as planned?

229
00:17:52.688 --> 00:17:55.333
Nobody wants to serve Lee.

230
00:17:55.335 --> 00:17:58.977
Rumors swirling about him
waving the white flag.

231
00:17:58.979 --> 00:18:01.241
supply lines diminishing.

232
00:18:01.243 --> 00:18:04.928
Hell. who wants to be on
the losing end of a rifle?

233
00:18:06.623 --> 00:18:11.013
Tell me. What is wrong
with an end to the war. huh?

234
00:18:11.015 --> 00:18:13.886
Brother versus brother is
no way to live out conflict.

235
00:18:19.637 --> 00:18:22.325
That's a curse on our confederacy.

236
00:18:27.185 --> 00:18:31.263
Forgive me. That was
unpleasant and uncalled for.

237
00:18:32.728 --> 00:18:35.387
But my passion equals my resolve.

238
00:18:37.525 --> 00:18:40.168
Then let's talk about
a return on investment.

239
00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:42.479
Once we win the war with the north.

240
00:18:42.481 --> 00:18:46.028
you will be greeted with
ten times your investment.

241
00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:48.665
Gold. labor. taxes. you name it.

242
00:18:48.667 --> 00:18:51.346
You're first money in. first money out.

243
00:18:53.678 --> 00:18:54.544
And how much?

244
00:18:54.546 --> 00:18:57.923
$1.000 a month until Christmas.

245
00:18:57.925 --> 00:19:00.759
$1.000. and what makes you think

246
00:19:00.761 --> 00:19:02.007
I have this kind of money?

247
00:19:05.297 --> 00:19:06.479
Mr. Garza.

248
00:19:10.226 --> 00:19:12.464
when a man like you comes to town.

249
00:19:13.756 --> 00:19:16.266
it behooves someone like me

250
00:19:16.268 --> 00:19:19.532
to do a little looking into his past.

251
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.696
I know all about the ranch in laredo.

252
00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.659
your sugar cane fields.

253
00:19:31.066 --> 00:19:33.433
how profitable you have been

254
00:19:33.435 --> 00:19:36.660
despite the uproars in Mexico.

255
00:19:44.103 --> 00:19:48.658
I'm gonna give you until
morning to consider my proposal.

256
00:19:53.527 --> 00:19:54.966
And if I reject?

257
00:19:59.252 --> 00:20:04.048
That would be very
unwise of you. Mr. Garza.

258
00:20:10.569 --> 00:20:14.403
I do not need until
morning to make my decision.

259
00:20:14.405 --> 00:20:17.280
I will not be bullied
into joining your war.

260
00:20:17.282 --> 00:20:19.103
You find another backer
who will help you spill

261
00:20:19.105 --> 00:20:21.452
the blood of your brothers in the north.

262
00:20:21.454 --> 00:20:23.040
That backer will not be me.

263
00:20:27.771 --> 00:20:31.335
Evening.

264
00:20:37.457 --> 00:20:39.780
Give me about a week. it'll be ready.

265
00:20:39.782 --> 00:20:41.726
All right. Much obliged.

266
00:20:41.728 --> 00:20:42.728
Thank you.

267
00:20:47.431 --> 00:20:49.705
Marisol! Marisol!

268
00:20:49.707 --> 00:20:51.451
Donde estas?

269
00:20:51.453 --> 00:20:53.053
Have you seen my daughter. Marisol garza?

270
00:20:53.055 --> 00:20:54.541
We ain't seen anyone. mister.

271
00:20:55.961 --> 00:20:58.022
Have you seen my
daughter. Marisol garza?

272
00:20:59.634 --> 00:21:00.784
She came by yesterday.

273
00:21:02.041 --> 00:21:03.527
Dropped off a list of medicine.

274
00:21:04.916 --> 00:21:06.304
Is she alright?

275
00:21:06.306 --> 00:21:08.810
I went this morning and
she was not in the hotel.

276
00:21:08.812 --> 00:21:09.970
What about the ladies' store?

277
00:21:09.972 --> 00:21:12.298
I've looked everywhere.
No one has seen her.

278
00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:13.509
You might need to check on that guy

279
00:21:13.511 --> 00:21:15.369
that came through town yesterday.

280
00:21:15.371 --> 00:21:16.683
the one who stayed at the hotel.

281
00:21:16.685 --> 00:21:17.685
Arliss?

282
00:21:19.109 --> 00:21:20.109
In my experience.

283
00:21:21.145 --> 00:21:23.447
men like that come through
town for two reasons.

284
00:21:24.329 --> 00:21:25.329
Which are?

285
00:21:26.861 --> 00:21:27.861
Take a guess.

286
00:21:28.693 --> 00:21:30.033
He approached me with a business offer

287
00:21:30.035 --> 00:21:31.189
to finance his army.

288
00:21:36.125 --> 00:21:38.645
He don't look like no general to me.

289
00:21:38.647 --> 00:21:39.969
The only one I haven't asked is

290
00:21:39.971 --> 00:21:41.585
the cantinero in the saloon.

291
00:21:44.171 --> 00:21:47.713
Huck? He might shed some light on it.

292
00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.612
I think you've had
enough there. old timer.

293
00:21:51.614 --> 00:21:52.812
Move it on down the road.

294
00:21:59.276 --> 00:22:00.838
Have you seen my
daughter. Marisol garza?

295
00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:01.840
No!

296
00:22:03.726 --> 00:22:06.151
Senor garza. is everything alright?

297
00:22:06.153 --> 00:22:07.887
You look like you've seen a ghost.

298
00:22:07.889 --> 00:22:10.193
- Marisol is missing.
- Missing?

299
00:22:11.562 --> 00:22:13.823
No one has seen her this morning.

300
00:22:13.825 --> 00:22:16.341
Where's that war empath that
crawled into town yesterday?

301
00:22:17.479 --> 00:22:18.594
Major beauregard.

302
00:22:19.742 --> 00:22:20.824
The last I saw of him was

303
00:22:20.826 --> 00:22:22.771
when I was locking up for the night.

304
00:22:22.773 --> 00:22:23.845
Where?

305
00:22:23.847 --> 00:22:25.916
He was walking into the hotel.

306
00:22:25.918 --> 00:22:27.595
He rented a room there. same as you.

307
00:22:27.597 --> 00:22:29.436
I didn't think nothing of it.

308
00:22:29.438 --> 00:22:30.438
The hotel.

309
00:22:34.406 --> 00:22:35.828
Don't give me that look. huck.

310
00:22:53.702 --> 00:22:54.702
Hey.

311
00:22:57.461 --> 00:22:58.696
What'd this beauregard
say when you told him

312
00:22:58.698 --> 00:23:00.089
you wouldn't finance his war?

313
00:23:01.633 --> 00:23:02.806
He did not say much.

314
00:23:07.196 --> 00:23:08.298
He met your daughter?

315
00:23:09.257 --> 00:23:10.408
He knows she's with you.

316
00:23:11.981 --> 00:23:12.981
Si.

317
00:23:14.849 --> 00:23:16.065
My money says that
son of a bitch took her

318
00:23:16.067 --> 00:23:19.546
- with him when he left.
- What? Why?

319
00:23:19.548 --> 00:23:21.095
- Ransom.
- Ransom?

320
00:23:27.997 --> 00:23:29.549
Think about it.

321
00:23:29.551 --> 00:23:30.798
She's nowhere to be found.

322
00:23:31.718 --> 00:23:33.984
- Her things still in her room?
- Yes.

323
00:23:34.797 --> 00:23:37.447
I bet that hotel says he
skinned out early this morning.

324
00:23:38.355 --> 00:23:39.504
Di me.

325
00:23:39.506 --> 00:23:41.916
- What can I do?
- Depends.

326
00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:44.352
Stay here. wait.

327
00:23:45.567 --> 00:23:47.828
Go to Mexico. hope he finds you.

328
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:49.545
No. I can pay someone

329
00:23:49.547 --> 00:23:51.645
to hunt him down like a dog and kill him.

330
00:23:51.647 --> 00:23:52.647
That's an option.

331
00:23:54.716 --> 00:23:57.754
I'll need a posse. a bounty hunter.

332
00:23:57.756 --> 00:24:00.871
That's no good. not in this town.

333
00:24:00.873 --> 00:24:03.441
You've got to go to lubbock
for that sort of thing.

334
00:24:03.443 --> 00:24:04.501
You can do it.

335
00:24:05.313 --> 00:24:06.855
Me? No.

336
00:24:06.857 --> 00:24:07.857
My days are over.

337
00:24:08.804 --> 00:24:10.874
No. I'll pay you 10.000 in gold.

338
00:24:10.876 --> 00:24:12.231
Just bring Marisol home.

339
00:24:14.424 --> 00:24:16.781
Think about it. You want
a ranch of your own?

340
00:24:16.783 --> 00:24:19.620
Land? All of it.

341
00:24:19.622 --> 00:24:21.092
I am a man of my word.

342
00:24:22.221 --> 00:24:24.185
I can set you up for
the rest of your life.

343
00:24:24.187 --> 00:24:27.787
Just bring me my daughter. and
you will see that I am true.

344
00:24:32.195 --> 00:24:34.414
I can't. I'm sorry.

345
00:24:36.319 --> 00:24:37.319
Good luck.

346
00:24:47.686 --> 00:24:50.041
What's the matter with you?

347
00:24:50.043 --> 00:24:50.901
Quick. give me a bourbon.

348
00:24:50.903 --> 00:24:53.205
before I change my mind
and do something stupid.

349
00:24:55.219 --> 00:24:57.383
It's a little early to
be drinking. even for you.

350
00:25:07.718 --> 00:25:10.595
Well. you know you're gonna
help that man find his daughter.

351
00:25:11.633 --> 00:25:12.633
I can't.

352
00:25:13.491 --> 00:25:15.983
I promised myself I wouldn't kill again.

353
00:25:15.985 --> 00:25:17.637
Well. who says you've gotta kill?

354
00:25:19.629 --> 00:25:21.656
Men like beauregard
don't listen to reason.

355
00:25:22.756 --> 00:25:23.768
All the more reason for you to stop him

356
00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:25.655
before he hurts somebody else.

357
00:25:28.683 --> 00:25:30.052
What if I can't find her?

358
00:25:30.054 --> 00:25:32.378
Well. there's always the
livery over there for ya.

359
00:25:36.087 --> 00:25:40.882
I came here to start
again. live a peaceful life.

360
00:25:42.784 --> 00:25:46.308
Well. you know what they say
about people who start again?

361
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:47.310
It's a good thing.

362
00:25:48.285 --> 00:25:49.434
Kind of scary when you find out

363
00:25:49.436 --> 00:25:52.193
what you're really made of in the process.

364
00:26:35.883 --> 00:26:36.883
I'll do it.

365
00:26:38.856 --> 00:26:40.201
10.000. not a penny less.

366
00:26:41.109 --> 00:26:43.232
Of course. I am a man of my word.

367
00:26:48.273 --> 00:26:50.875
I'm gonna go to my ranch.
pack some belongings.

368
00:26:52.954 --> 00:26:54.141
And I'll be on the trail at first light.

369
00:26:54.143 --> 00:26:56.059
I'll do everything in my
power to bring her back.

370
00:26:56.061 --> 00:26:58.826
Please. Just bring my mijita back to me.

371
00:27:00.329 --> 00:27:02.422
I won't kill arliss
without a good reason.

372
00:27:03.455 --> 00:27:05.325
If he touches one hair on her head...

373
00:27:06.629 --> 00:27:07.732
That's a good reason.

374
00:27:08.595 --> 00:27:10.694
I can have my vaqueros ride with you.

375
00:27:10.696 --> 00:27:13.259
No. No. it's best I go alone.

376
00:27:14.436 --> 00:27:16.966
Besides. I don't know
how long I might be gone.

377
00:27:16.968 --> 00:27:18.088
Then find me before you ride

378
00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:20.152
and I will give you
half the gold up front.

379
00:27:21.178 --> 00:27:22.514
Just bring me my daughter.

380
00:27:44.169 --> 00:27:46.929
You'll never get away with this.

381
00:27:46.931 --> 00:27:48.020
Is that right?

382
00:27:48.022 --> 00:27:49.455
My father will send his vaqueros for me.

383
00:27:49.457 --> 00:27:51.402
and when they find you...

384
00:27:51.404 --> 00:27:55.438
"When." "when" is key
word in your sentence.

385
00:27:56.711 --> 00:27:58.684
What are you going to do with me?

386
00:27:58.686 --> 00:27:59.686
Right now?

387
00:28:02.235 --> 00:28:03.235
Nothing.

388
00:28:05.869 --> 00:28:07.411
But you see this?

389
00:28:07.413 --> 00:28:09.157
This here is a ransom note

390
00:28:09.159 --> 00:28:11.878
that's gonna be delivered
to your father demanding

391
00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:16.675
$10.000 in exchange for your
safe return back to Mexico.

392
00:28:18.634 --> 00:28:19.654
Your war money.

393
00:28:23.151 --> 00:28:24.252
With that kind of money.

394
00:28:24.254 --> 00:28:26.631
we can fund the army through the new year.

395
00:28:26.633 --> 00:28:28.928
should Lee roll over and die.

396
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:36.106
My father is many
things. loyal. wealthy.

397
00:28:36.108 --> 00:28:37.703
A fool is not one of them.

398
00:28:39.954 --> 00:28:42.013
Well neither am I.

399
00:28:42.015 --> 00:28:46.109
With that kind of money. I
could promote myself to general.

400
00:28:46.111 --> 00:28:48.473
take command of my own private army.

401
00:28:49.282 --> 00:28:52.429
Hell. your
father couldn't touch me

402
00:28:52.431 --> 00:28:56.588
with a copper cannonball.
even if he tried.

403
00:29:06.423 --> 00:29:08.037
Shame. really.

404
00:30:21.238 --> 00:30:23.768
Hey. mister. you want
a drink or something?

405
00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:24.825
I'll have a whiskey.

406
00:30:25.717 --> 00:30:27.978
You're new in town. ain't you?

407
00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:28.980
How can you tell?

408
00:30:30.157 --> 00:30:31.311
It's pretty obvious.

409
00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:37.022
I don't get nothing but regulars
walking in and out of here.

410
00:30:37.024 --> 00:30:39.793
let alone an ex-soldier like yourself.

411
00:30:39.795 --> 00:30:40.795
Soldier?

412
00:30:41.991 --> 00:30:44.929
Obvious. Y'all carry
it in your shoulders.

413
00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:48.779
The reason I'm in
town is I'm looking for

414
00:30:48.781 --> 00:30:50.904
a fellow that goes by arliss beauregard.

415
00:30:52.311 --> 00:30:54.820
He says he's a major.
but I have my doubts.

416
00:30:54.822 --> 00:30:56.687
He might've come through
on a recruiting trip.

417
00:30:56.689 --> 00:30:57.689
Recruiting?

418
00:30:58.609 --> 00:31:00.988
Yeah. For confederate men
looking to join the cause?

419
00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:02.959
What cause would that be. sugar?

420
00:31:04.133 --> 00:31:05.133
A senseless one.

421
00:31:05.834 --> 00:31:07.917
Well. what's this
arliss feller look like?

422
00:31:09.027 --> 00:31:10.034
Not like a soldier.

423
00:31:10.993 --> 00:31:13.149
Looks like he's been counting
money his whole life.

424
00:31:13.151 --> 00:31:14.541
- Got a girl with him.
- Wife?

425
00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:19.315
Hostage. a Mexican. That's
why I'm looking for him.

426
00:31:19.317 --> 00:31:20.783
Well. like I said.

427
00:31:20.785 --> 00:31:23.614
I don't get nothing but regulars
coming in and out of here.

428
00:31:28.581 --> 00:31:30.419
Thanks for the drink.

429
00:31:32.239 --> 00:31:35.356
Ma'am.

430
00:31:54.343 --> 00:31:55.463
Hey. mister.

431
00:31:56.702 --> 00:31:58.166
About that man you're looking for...

432
00:31:58.168 --> 00:31:59.454
What about him?

433
00:31:59.456 --> 00:32:01.858
Is there a reward or
a bounty or something?

434
00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:03.441
Perhaps.

435
00:32:03.443 --> 00:32:06.821
Well. meet me out back.

436
00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:09.056
- at dark.
- At dark.

437
00:32:24.858 --> 00:32:26.968
Your man came through
here a few days ago.

438
00:32:27.994 --> 00:32:30.342
Why did you lie to me in the bar?

439
00:32:30.344 --> 00:32:33.080
Small town and lots of
ears in that old place.

440
00:32:33.988 --> 00:32:35.708
Fair enough. So?

441
00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:39.386
Like I said. he came through here.

442
00:32:39.388 --> 00:32:41.304
Mexican gal with him.

443
00:32:41.306 --> 00:32:42.651
He bought a bottle of rye.

444
00:32:43.722 --> 00:32:46.363
Got a big old room at the hotel up yonder.

445
00:32:47.175 --> 00:32:49.129
He asked about a couple of whores. too.

446
00:32:49.131 --> 00:32:50.443
Which I thought was mighty strange

447
00:32:50.445 --> 00:32:52.987
being he had that pretty
young lady with him already.

448
00:32:53.965 --> 00:32:55.075
I guess he doesn't want the trouble

449
00:32:55.077 --> 00:32:57.991
that comes with touching a woman
who don't wanna be touched.

450
00:32:57.993 --> 00:33:00.149
especially with her father
being who he is and all.

451
00:33:00.151 --> 00:33:03.218
What? Is she some kind of
Mexican royalty or something?

452
00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:04.220
More or less.

453
00:33:08.063 --> 00:33:09.063
What's this for?

454
00:33:09.852 --> 00:33:11.252
Did they say where they were going?

455
00:33:16.969 --> 00:33:18.704
Son of a bitch.

456
00:33:59.276 --> 00:34:01.110
- Evening.
- No vacancies.

457
00:34:02.258 --> 00:34:04.400
I ain't looking for a
room. I'm looking for a man.

458
00:34:05.231 --> 00:34:07.483
Goes by the name of beauregard.
have you heard of him?

459
00:34:07.485 --> 00:34:09.499
Well. I can't give out that information.

460
00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:11.885
What about now?

461
00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:21.821
Arliss beauregard.
checked out two days ago.

462
00:34:21.823 --> 00:34:22.823
Alone?

463
00:34:24.682 --> 00:34:28.122
Well. it doesn't
say. but I seem to remember

464
00:34:28.124 --> 00:34:29.898
he had several lady friends with him.

465
00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:31.825
Any of them Mexican?

466
00:34:32.737 --> 00:34:35.060
Well. perhaps. Don't really recall.

467
00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:39.323
Make any mention of where he was going?

468
00:34:39.325 --> 00:34:41.414
Well. now that you mention it.

469
00:34:41.416 --> 00:34:43.572
I did overhear him talking
to the hotel barkeep

470
00:34:43.574 --> 00:34:45.787
- about Jackson.
- Mississippi?

471
00:34:45.789 --> 00:34:46.844
Yep. That's the one.

472
00:34:47.963 --> 00:34:50.649
He even had us telegram a
letter for him before he left.

473
00:34:51.524 --> 00:34:52.321
A letter. huh?

474
00:34:52.323 --> 00:34:53.867
Oh yeah. First class.

475
00:34:54.910 --> 00:34:57.439
Not to Jackson. though. San Antonio.

476
00:34:57.441 --> 00:34:59.942
Said he had some business down there.

477
00:34:59.944 --> 00:35:01.981
Did you see what was on
that letter by any chance?

478
00:35:04.203 --> 00:35:05.203
Nope.

479
00:35:05.948 --> 00:35:07.022
How about now?

480
00:35:29.067 --> 00:35:30.067
Afternoon.

481
00:35:30.845 --> 00:35:32.267
- How are you?
- Doing well.

482
00:35:33.312 --> 00:35:34.158
I'm looking for an arliss beauregard.

483
00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:36.165
Do you know where I can find him?

484
00:35:36.167 --> 00:35:37.167
Right that way.

485
00:35:39.893 --> 00:35:41.373
- Much obliged.
- Have a good evening.

486
00:35:56.881 --> 00:35:58.240
May I help you?

487
00:35:59.693 --> 00:36:01.515
You're a long way from Texas. major.

488
00:36:05.159 --> 00:36:06.159
Excuse me?

489
00:36:07.806 --> 00:36:10.283
It's over. Where is she?

490
00:36:11.249 --> 00:36:12.924
And you are?

491
00:36:12.926 --> 00:36:14.796
It doesn't matter who I am.

492
00:36:14.798 --> 00:36:15.852
I'm here for the girl.

493
00:36:18.701 --> 00:36:21.288
Don't tell me that mister garza paid you

494
00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:25.920
to come all the way here to
save his previous little Nina.

495
00:36:25.922 --> 00:36:27.848
It's more noble that
what you're doing here.

496
00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:28.850
Is that right?

497
00:36:30.861 --> 00:36:33.238
I'm taking Marisol garza back to Texas.

498
00:36:36.107 --> 00:36:38.834
I might just have
something to say about that.

499
00:36:40.087 --> 00:36:43.409
You see. Marisol is my fiance.

500
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:46.756
We are to be married in the fall.

501
00:36:48.872 --> 00:36:50.790
I ain't here to argue with you. major.

502
00:36:51.751 --> 00:36:53.269
And I ain't asking.

503
00:36:55.835 --> 00:36:57.003
We're getting her together.

504
00:36:57.005 --> 00:37:00.388
There's no need to. She's right outside.

505
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:02.970
Marisol. darling. come in here.

506
00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:11.436
Come here. darling.

507
00:37:11.438 --> 00:37:14.429
This man's got some kind of crazy idea

508
00:37:14.431 --> 00:37:17.435
that you're here being
held against your will.

509
00:37:18.458 --> 00:37:22.087
I informed him that we are
gonna be married in September.

510
00:37:23.896 --> 00:37:26.397
And then I got to thinking.

511
00:37:26.399 --> 00:37:28.857
maybe we should extend him an invite.

512
00:37:31.751 --> 00:37:33.312
What do you say?

513
00:37:33.314 --> 00:37:34.657
Whatever you say. my love.

514
00:37:35.769 --> 00:37:38.975
Marisol. your father sent me.

515
00:37:39.807 --> 00:37:43.550
Oh! Did he get the telegram?

516
00:37:44.449 --> 00:37:47.142
He's gonna make one
hell of a father-in-law.

517
00:37:47.144 --> 00:37:48.705
Don't you think. Marisol?

518
00:37:48.707 --> 00:37:50.323
What telegram are you talking about?

519
00:37:50.325 --> 00:37:52.464
Why the ransom note.

520
00:37:52.466 --> 00:37:54.651
I knew that he would be more than happy

521
00:37:54.653 --> 00:37:59.297
to financially support
our struggle for Liberty.

522
00:38:00.743 --> 00:38:04.836
You blackmailed him. in
exchange for his own daughter.

523
00:38:04.838 --> 00:38:08.960
I gave him every chance
to support this cause.

524
00:38:08.962 --> 00:38:12.086
He chose to turn his back on me

525
00:38:12.088 --> 00:38:15.361
and the freedom of every
man south of the Dixon.

526
00:38:16.174 --> 00:38:20.969
Now he was either too stupid
not to see what was coming

527
00:38:21.132 --> 00:38:23.010
or he was too blind not to see

528
00:38:23.012 --> 00:38:25.450
what was going on right under his nose.

529
00:38:27.117 --> 00:38:31.528
I'm curious. What did he
offer you to come get her?

530
00:38:34.204 --> 00:38:35.498
Everything you asked for.

531
00:38:36.697 --> 00:38:37.697
All of it.

532
00:38:38.674 --> 00:38:41.233
He ain't paying you a red
cent. you son of a bitch.

533
00:38:51.495 --> 00:38:53.253
Hey! Where'd you go?

534
00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:57.192
This is how it's going
to work. journeyman!

535
00:38:58.439 --> 00:39:00.902
You're either going to ride back to Texas

536
00:39:00.904 --> 00:39:05.524
and tell her father you
couldn't find his little girl.

537
00:39:05.526 --> 00:39:08.703
or I'm gonna put a bullet
in the side of her skull.

538
00:39:09.611 --> 00:39:12.035
Now. what's it going to be?

539
00:39:12.037 --> 00:39:13.037
Alright!

540
00:39:15.164 --> 00:39:16.171
Don't shoot the girl!

541
00:39:18.224 --> 00:39:19.475
I'm coming out.

542
00:39:19.477 --> 00:39:21.348
- What's your answer?
- I repeat.

543
00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:22.437
do not shoot the girl!

544
00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:35.355
That's what I thought. yeah.

545
00:39:36.204 --> 00:39:39.148
Now. I'm gonna give you three seconds

546
00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:42.298
to get on your horse and
ride the hell out of here.

547
00:39:43.153 --> 00:39:44.961
or Marisol's gonna die.

548
00:40:17.694 --> 00:40:18.694
Hey. Tully.

549
00:40:21.675 --> 00:40:25.167
How could you betray the south?

550
00:40:27.485 --> 00:40:30.962
How could you betray the confederacy?

551
00:40:30.964 --> 00:40:33.195
$10.000 and a bullet cuts a lot of ties.

552
00:40:42.264 --> 00:40:43.264
Let's go.

553
00:40:52.466 --> 00:40:54.314
- Hey. Are you okay?
- Yes.

554
00:40:54.316 --> 00:40:56.256
It's alright. he's gone.

555
00:40:56.258 --> 00:40:57.916
No one's gonna hurt you.

556
00:40:57.918 --> 00:41:00.372
Don't worry. no one's going to hurt you.

557
00:41:00.374 --> 00:41:01.510
You're going home.

558
00:41:01.512 --> 00:41:02.960
Alright? You're going home.

559
00:41:10.661 --> 00:41:12.244
How long is the ride back home?

560
00:41:15.949 --> 00:41:17.147
About a week.

561
00:41:19.739 --> 00:41:20.890
No one's gonna hurt you.

562
00:41:24.261 --> 00:41:26.083
Does my father know I'm still alive?

563
00:41:27.841 --> 00:41:29.404
I don't really know what he knows.

564
00:41:31.425 --> 00:41:33.151
I haven't been back in eight months.

565
00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:38.777
They got those in laredo?

566
00:41:40.248 --> 00:41:42.118
I take it you haven't been to laredo.

567
00:41:43.902 --> 00:41:46.293
Once. a long time ago.

568
00:41:48.185 --> 00:41:49.384
I went out west to fight.

569
00:41:52.602 --> 00:41:54.424
I was with the volunteers in Missouri.

570
00:41:56.427 --> 00:41:58.968
By the time we got to
San antone. it was 1842.

571
00:42:03.543 --> 00:42:05.502
700 of us on the way to mier.

572
00:42:10.534 --> 00:42:12.261
Somervell had had it with the raids.

573
00:42:14.735 --> 00:42:15.735
We took laredo.

574
00:42:17.449 --> 00:42:18.900
guererro not long after that.

575
00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:25.997
Two days before Christmas.
well that same 700.

576
00:42:27.059 --> 00:42:28.740
we all went across the rio grande.

577
00:42:31.633 --> 00:42:32.430
What we didn't know.

578
00:42:32.432 --> 00:42:34.312
there was 1.000 Mexicans waiting for us.

579
00:42:38.414 --> 00:42:39.433
We were outnumbered.

580
00:42:46.345 --> 00:42:47.863
Still ended up killing 600.

581
00:42:49.948 --> 00:42:51.958
Left another 200 for dead.

582
00:42:55.647 --> 00:42:58.045
The day after Christmas.
the Mexicans surrendered.

583
00:43:02.191 --> 00:43:04.013
I never seen so much blood or fear.

584
00:43:09.237 --> 00:43:10.645
Some of us had made it back over

585
00:43:10.647 --> 00:43:12.040
with the skin on our backs.

586
00:43:16.662 --> 00:43:18.980
The Mexicans caught the rest.

587
00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:21.714
Executed one for every ten.

588
00:43:28.828 --> 00:43:33.224
When the war was over. well.
I was gonna live in Texas.

589
00:43:39.217 --> 00:43:41.950
I signed up for Lee's army
and went and fought the north.

590
00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:44.331
Worst mistake of my life.

591
00:43:48.124 --> 00:43:49.124
Why?

592
00:43:54.073 --> 00:43:55.672
No one wins a war.

593
00:43:57.793 --> 00:43:58.793
Poor people die.

594
00:44:00.907 --> 00:44:02.237
and the rich get richer.

595
00:44:05.814 --> 00:44:08.681
I saw it the same in Mexico
as I did in Virginia.

596
00:44:09.928 --> 00:44:12.304
I just thought I could make a difference.

597
00:44:12.306 --> 00:44:15.845
- Did you?
- A difference?

598
00:44:17.041 --> 00:44:18.041
Hell no.

599
00:44:22.355 --> 00:44:24.913
I am thankful you came for me.

600
00:44:29.166 --> 00:44:31.324
It wasn't an easy choice.

601
00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:36.225
but it was the right one.

602
00:44:42.063 --> 00:44:43.309
Time to get some shut eye.

603
00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:45.275
We've got a long trip.

604
00:45:04.552 --> 00:45:07.169
Marisol! Mari.

605
00:45:07.171 --> 00:45:09.614
Oye. Are you okay?

606
00:45:09.616 --> 00:45:10.616
I'm fine.

607
00:45:13.793 --> 00:45:14.793
Oye.

608
00:45:16.879 --> 00:45:19.070
I was worried sick.

609
00:45:19.072 --> 00:45:22.005
I never heard back from you
after he sent the telegram.

610
00:45:22.007 --> 00:45:25.321
and I thought for sure you were be dead.

611
00:45:25.323 --> 00:45:27.692
I told you that I didn't
know how long it was gonna be.

612
00:45:27.694 --> 00:45:28.694
And beauregard?

613
00:45:31.386 --> 00:45:32.880
Bueno. A deal is a deal.

614
00:45:32.882 --> 00:45:34.280
Please. come inside.

615
00:45:34.282 --> 00:45:35.913
Let's share a drink and celebrate.

616
00:45:39.663 --> 00:45:42.106
Thank you. but it's been a long trip.

617
00:45:42.108 --> 00:45:45.372
Of course. I'll stop by in
the morning with your payment.

618
00:46:14.102 --> 00:46:16.473
Ah. I thought you would be sleeping.

619
00:46:21.333 --> 00:46:22.675
Not much sleep these days.

620
00:46:23.654 --> 00:46:24.744
Ah. me either.

621
00:46:25.821 --> 00:46:28.698
Look. I just wanted to stop by
before I head back to laredo.

622
00:46:31.853 --> 00:46:34.671
I cannot thank you enough
for what you have done.

623
00:46:34.673 --> 00:46:36.546
Marisol told me what had happened.

624
00:46:44.551 --> 00:46:46.314
I'm just happy to be home.

625
00:46:46.316 --> 00:46:47.371
Thanks for the bounty.

626
00:46:48.464 --> 00:46:49.474
It is not a bounty.

627
00:46:51.485 --> 00:46:52.500
Excuse me?

628
00:46:52.502 --> 00:46:54.787
It is not a bounty
or a payment for a job.

629
00:46:57.076 --> 00:46:58.249
It is a wedding present.

630
00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:07.221
I don't want to marry your daughter.

631
00:47:07.223 --> 00:47:08.805
Ah. but she wants to marry you.

632
00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:12.448
Look. make it easy for her.

633
00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:14.759
A man should ask for a
woman's hand in marriage.

634
00:47:14.761 --> 00:47:16.001
not the other way around.

635
00:47:18.607 --> 00:47:19.892
What about Mexico?

636
00:47:19.894 --> 00:47:22.570
Mexico. She is in love.

637
00:47:23.814 --> 00:47:24.821
Who am I to stop her?

638
00:47:32.932 --> 00:47:35.809
I ain't never been married before.

639
00:47:37.357 --> 00:47:40.249
It will not be easy.
but I have faith in you.

640
00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:53.543
Sorry. I did
not mean to scare you.

641
00:47:53.545 --> 00:47:56.247
- Your father was...
- My answer is yes.

642
00:47:56.249 --> 00:47:58.630
I overheard you talking about the wedding.

643
00:48:03.097 --> 00:48:04.247
I ain't the right guy.

644
00:48:07.035 --> 00:48:08.874
How do you know that?

645
00:48:11.715 --> 00:48:13.794
What if it doesn't work?

646
00:48:15.111 --> 00:48:16.950
Then it doesn't work.

647
00:48:21.407 --> 00:48:22.424
Then it's settled.

648
00:48:24.285 --> 00:48:28.552
Yes.

649
00:48:31.407 --> 00:48:33.590
This gold isn't safe here. okay?

650
00:48:33.592 --> 00:48:34.389
Okay.

651
00:48:34.391 --> 00:48:35.558
I'm gonna take it to the bank.

652
00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:36.357
I will go with you.

653
00:48:36.359 --> 00:48:37.634
No. no. no. no. You stay here.

654
00:48:38.687 --> 00:48:40.125
You stay here and wait for me.

655
00:48:41.261 --> 00:48:42.411
- Okay.
- I'll be back.

656
00:49:01.886 --> 00:49:04.214
Hey. there. I wanna talk to you.

657
00:49:04.216 --> 00:49:05.876
Now what you got in that there bag?

658
00:49:05.878 --> 00:49:07.638
None of your business
what's in this bag.

659
00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:08.530
Yeah. it is.

660
00:49:08.532 --> 00:49:10.927
It become my business in Jackson.

661
00:49:10.929 --> 00:49:12.807
What do you think. Waylon?

662
00:49:12.809 --> 00:49:16.399
Well. I do think we
ought to have a look-see.

663
00:49:17.643 --> 00:49:20.595
Now. don't make us have
to go visit the girl.

664
00:49:20.597 --> 00:49:22.925
cooperative as she is known to be.

665
00:49:22.927 --> 00:49:25.965
Yeah. Wasn't that arliss's woman?

666
00:49:25.967 --> 00:49:27.644
I believe there was gonna be a marriage

667
00:49:27.646 --> 00:49:29.033
as a matter of fact.

668
00:49:29.035 --> 00:49:31.441
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit?

669
00:49:31.443 --> 00:49:33.638
Convince a Texas judge otherwise.

670
00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:36.726
especially with two eye-witness soldiers.

671
00:49:36.728 --> 00:49:38.557
I believe that there is gold.

672
00:49:38.559 --> 00:49:40.749
- Oh. no shit?
- A lot of it. too.

673
00:49:41.785 --> 00:49:43.755
Well. hell. it looks
like we might've hit

674
00:49:43.757 --> 00:49:44.951
the jackpot with this one. Tully.

675
00:49:44.953 --> 00:49:46.431
I believe so.

676
00:49:46.433 --> 00:49:48.617
Take the gold and leave town.

677
00:49:48.619 --> 00:49:50.286
Are you trying to give orders now. boy?

678
00:49:50.288 --> 00:49:52.914
The man we take orders
from is dead because of you.

679
00:49:52.916 --> 00:49:56.156
We tracked you all the way into Texas.

680
00:49:56.158 --> 00:49:58.445
This is gonna be your penance.

681
00:50:02.823 --> 00:50:04.806
We oughta make it quick.
before someone sees us.

682
00:50:04.808 --> 00:50:06.834
Nah. let's make him remember that.

683
00:50:16.169 --> 00:50:18.299
Come on. Let's get outta here.

684
00:50:39.471 --> 00:50:40.679
How was your day?

685
00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:48.140
Same.

686
00:50:50.546 --> 00:50:51.996
Did you get the corral repaired?

687
00:50:53.892 --> 00:50:54.892
Yep.

688
00:50:56.793 --> 00:50:58.254
And?

689
00:50:58.256 --> 00:50:59.668
- And what?
- That's it?

690
00:51:01.277 --> 00:51:03.207
That's it? It's a god-damned fence.

691
00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:06.198
Alright? It was broken and now it's fixed.

692
00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:08.917
You don't have to be an asshole.

693
00:51:15.499 --> 00:51:20.292
Every day. we talk about the fence.

694
00:51:20.294 --> 00:51:21.294
Every day.

695
00:51:23.248 --> 00:51:26.665
Now it's fixed. so I
want you to be satisfied.

696
00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:28.696
Now look. don't take this out on me.

697
00:51:28.698 --> 00:51:31.106
I'm not the one who
lost the gold. you did.

698
00:51:31.108 --> 00:51:32.738
We need to make a life without it.

699
00:51:36.675 --> 00:51:37.998
Have I never complained?

700
00:51:45.309 --> 00:51:46.309
You don't have to.

701
00:51:47.876 --> 00:51:48.876
Oh really?

702
00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:51.386
I see the way you look at me.

703
00:51:53.122 --> 00:51:55.523
- And how is that?
- Ashamed.

704
00:52:03.988 --> 00:52:06.242
How many times has my
father offered us help?

705
00:52:09.838 --> 00:52:10.973
I don't want his money.

706
00:52:11.872 --> 00:52:13.692
Not just his money.
but moving to laredo?

707
00:52:13.694 --> 00:52:17.437
A texan living in
Mexico? No way in hell.

708
00:52:18.882 --> 00:52:20.501
- What do you want from me?
- I want the man I married.

709
00:52:20.503 --> 00:52:22.438
not the man you are now.

710
00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:24.337
I don't want him. Where
is James Orville bain?

711
00:52:24.339 --> 00:52:25.401
That's the man I want.

712
00:52:26.746 --> 00:52:27.543
I hate it when you use that name.

713
00:52:27.545 --> 00:52:28.739
Yeah. it was your grandfather's name.

714
00:52:28.741 --> 00:52:30.528
- You should be proud.
- I am proud!

715
00:52:34.361 --> 00:52:36.794
That's exactly why I
hate it that you stayed!

716
00:52:41.669 --> 00:52:43.225
You'd rather have me leave.

717
00:52:51.266 --> 00:52:53.503
I didn't mean what I said.

718
00:52:56.542 --> 00:52:58.867
I don't want you to go anywhere.

719
00:53:01.732 --> 00:53:05.120
This life I imagined
when I set out after you.

720
00:53:08.359 --> 00:53:09.685
it's not what's happened.

721
00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:12.511
I wanted something more.

722
00:53:13.458 --> 00:53:14.596
Honey. you're wrong.

723
00:53:18.352 --> 00:53:20.625
I married you. James Orville bain.

724
00:53:22.695 --> 00:53:24.853
and I love you to this day.

725
00:53:26.885 --> 00:53:29.474
You aren't just some man who
shovels out horse stalls.

726
00:53:34.185 --> 00:53:36.733
I don't know if I can
find that other man.

727
00:53:36.735 --> 00:53:39.044
Well. we can try together.

728
00:53:39.046 --> 00:53:42.068
We can find him. the two of us.

729
00:54:07.363 --> 00:54:09.521
Now. here's a good thing.

730
00:54:12.424 --> 00:54:15.381
I don't know. Waylon. I don't know.

731
00:54:16.553 --> 00:54:18.353
But if I was a betting man.

732
00:54:20.546 --> 00:54:21.546
which I am.

733
00:54:24.257 --> 00:54:26.989
we're gonna have all of our luck up here.

734
00:54:26.991 --> 00:54:28.442
uphill. in the north track.

735
00:54:29.379 --> 00:54:31.153
That old man ain't ever gonna sell.

736
00:54:32.707 --> 00:54:33.707
Family land.

737
00:54:35.085 --> 00:54:38.097
Oh. we just haven't made
him the right offer yet.

738
00:54:38.099 --> 00:54:38.896
And what would that be?

739
00:54:38.898 --> 00:54:40.034
What was the last offer?

740
00:54:41.607 --> 00:54:43.686
Well. I've got my notes.

741
00:54:45.356 --> 00:54:46.452
Let's see.

742
00:54:48.588 --> 00:54:49.588
Yep.

743
00:54:50.432 --> 00:54:51.895
- $200.
- $200.

744
00:54:51.897 --> 00:54:54.216
- Cash in hand.
- Make it three $300.

745
00:54:54.218 --> 00:54:56.009
Tell him we can start drilling next month.

746
00:54:56.011 --> 00:54:59.313
A month advance on top. that's 600 total.

747
00:55:00.247 --> 00:55:01.289
- $600?
- Yeah.

748
00:55:02.139 --> 00:55:02.953
You sure about that?

749
00:55:02.955 --> 00:55:04.602
If he don't sell for
that. he's a damned fool.

750
00:55:04.604 --> 00:55:06.378
Do you want the tract or not. Waylon?

751
00:55:07.913 --> 00:55:10.352
You've gotta spend money to make money.

752
00:55:10.354 --> 00:55:11.151
I guess that makes sense.

753
00:55:11.153 --> 00:55:13.771
And that reminds me.
too. there's a racehorse

754
00:55:13.773 --> 00:55:15.739
I want to look at just outside of Austin.

755
00:55:17.475 --> 00:55:20.426
- That's in Texas.
- Why?

756
00:55:20.428 --> 00:55:22.251
- You wanna go back to Texas?
- Yeah.

757
00:55:23.795 --> 00:55:26.792
Well. what about the
fellow we damn near killed?

758
00:55:26.794 --> 00:55:29.930
"Damn near killed?" I
believe he bellied up. Waylon.

759
00:55:29.932 --> 00:55:32.649
I've seen tougher men die
from less. so have you.

760
00:55:33.529 --> 00:55:35.047
Well. how do you know he's dead?

761
00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:38.054
You know how I know he's dead?

762
00:55:38.056 --> 00:55:39.741
'Cause I can't for the life of me remember

763
00:55:39.743 --> 00:55:40.743
what he looks like.

764
00:55:41.847 --> 00:55:42.782
And that's just how.

765
00:55:42.784 --> 00:55:44.057
That happens every time.

766
00:55:44.059 --> 00:55:46.373
You know. when they're
gone they're just gone.

767
00:55:47.761 --> 00:55:49.859
But what I do remember clear as the day is

768
00:55:49.861 --> 00:55:52.008
that sweet seniorita he had with him.

769
00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:53.667
Remember her?

770
00:55:53.669 --> 00:55:54.789
She was awfully pretty.

771
00:55:54.791 --> 00:55:56.942
Yeah. I wouldn't mind
bumping into her again.

772
00:55:58.713 --> 00:56:00.190
Alright. Well...

773
00:56:01.255 --> 00:56:04.082
When do you wanna go?

774
00:56:04.084 --> 00:56:05.971
I say we settle up the
tract with the old man

775
00:56:05.973 --> 00:56:07.410
and catch a train down to Austin

776
00:56:07.412 --> 00:56:09.385
and ride the rest of the way.

777
00:56:09.387 --> 00:56:11.380
You know. it's been awhile

778
00:56:11.382 --> 00:56:14.368
since I took a horse on a nice long ride.

779
00:56:17.951 --> 00:56:18.951
I got it.

780
00:56:28.322 --> 00:56:30.700
How are you
and the lady holding up?

781
00:56:32.002 --> 00:56:33.002
Why do you ask?

782
00:56:33.737 --> 00:56:35.385
Just making conversation.

783
00:56:35.387 --> 00:56:36.387
No you ain't.

784
00:56:36.989 --> 00:56:39.068
She said something. didn't she?

785
00:56:39.070 --> 00:56:39.979
Well. she came through here

786
00:56:39.981 --> 00:56:41.803
a couple of days ago. looking for you.

787
00:56:42.685 --> 00:56:44.795
Kind of sounded like
the honeymoon was over.

788
00:56:47.356 --> 00:56:49.142
Yeah. for a very long time.

789
00:56:52.861 --> 00:56:54.566
Well. maybe that
racehorse coming into town

790
00:56:54.568 --> 00:56:55.860
will cheer you up.

791
00:56:55.862 --> 00:56:56.965
What racehorse?

792
00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:01.770
You haven't heard?

793
00:57:03.842 --> 00:57:04.993
Tully and Waylon Ford?

794
00:57:07.265 --> 00:57:09.345
What? You know those two men?

795
00:57:09.347 --> 00:57:11.617
Oilmen from Mississippi?

796
00:57:11.619 --> 00:57:13.259
- I'll be damned. It's them.
- Who?

797
00:57:14.923 --> 00:57:17.386
Those two sons of bitches
that jumped me five years back.

798
00:57:20.328 --> 00:57:21.124
Are you sure?

799
00:57:21.126 --> 00:57:22.781
I'll never forget their faces.

800
00:57:22.783 --> 00:57:24.561
They're coming through San antone?

801
00:57:24.563 --> 00:57:25.923
- Here. look at that.
- Let me see.

802
00:57:27.846 --> 00:57:31.311
Yeah. It says their horse
won first place last year.

803
00:57:33.397 --> 00:57:35.071
And they're taking the horse on tour.

804
00:57:36.037 --> 00:57:39.123
Says they're looking to sell
some of their stock too.

805
00:57:39.125 --> 00:57:42.532
I've got to convince them
to meet me here. alone.

806
00:57:44.802 --> 00:57:46.694
- Jim...
- Hey. hey.

807
00:57:50.604 --> 00:57:51.401
Somehow I'll do it.

808
00:57:51.403 --> 00:57:54.280
I'll get 'em alone. tell 'em
I'm here to buy that horse.

809
00:57:56.771 --> 00:57:58.035
Let me get my gold back.

810
00:57:58.037 --> 00:58:00.632
put those sons of bitches in the dirt.

811
00:58:02.717 --> 00:58:04.753
You think they've got that gold on them?

812
00:58:05.583 --> 00:58:06.618
They just travel the country

813
00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:08.810
with a pot of gold on their hip?

814
00:58:09.709 --> 00:58:11.097
- Do you Irish...
- Hey.

815
00:58:11.099 --> 00:58:14.300
You said it yourself. "oilmen."

816
00:58:14.302 --> 00:58:16.938
Well I don't know so much about that.

817
00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:19.050
Alright. Somehow we'll
get 'em to the bar.

818
00:58:20.059 --> 00:58:22.795
I don't know how yet. but I'm gonna do it.

819
00:58:22.797 --> 00:58:24.188
convince 'em I'm here to buy that horse.

820
00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:25.886
You think somebody's
really going to sell

821
00:58:25.888 --> 00:58:27.387
a first place racehorse?

822
00:58:28.573 --> 00:58:32.086
If that offer is big enough.
they sure as shit will.

823
00:58:34.145 --> 00:58:36.497
- Why here?
- Hey. people here know me.

824
00:58:37.747 --> 00:58:39.087
know what I've been through.

825
00:58:40.369 --> 00:58:42.335
This is my chance to set things straight.

826
00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:44.920
get my life back.

827
00:58:46.286 --> 00:58:48.505
- What about Marisol?
- What about her?

828
00:58:50.257 --> 00:58:51.885
She'll cut my man-parts off

829
00:58:51.887 --> 00:58:54.189
if she finds out I had
anything to do with this.

830
00:58:56.577 --> 00:58:58.543
Huck. you can help me with this or not.

831
00:59:01.756 --> 00:59:03.050
Now. that's what I thought.

832
00:59:32.103 --> 00:59:33.493
Christ. Waylon.

833
00:59:34.493 --> 00:59:35.924
What? Did I scare you. brother?

834
00:59:35.926 --> 00:59:37.737
I think I had a god damned heart attack.

835
00:59:37.739 --> 00:59:39.506
What've you got for me today to do?

836
00:59:41.939 --> 00:59:44.138
- Central union gram.
- What's it say?

837
00:59:45.008 --> 00:59:48.881
Well. apparently some old
boy down in Texas wants to buy

838
00:59:48.883 --> 00:59:51.359
- one of our horses.
- How much?

839
00:59:51.361 --> 00:59:52.560
You're gonna like this.

840
00:59:53.477 --> 00:59:55.959
- $1.000.
- Oh. no shit.

841
00:59:55.961 --> 00:59:57.207
That's all I need to know.

842
00:59:58.914 --> 01:00:01.358
Heard about your good fortune
in the San Antonio express.

843
01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:03.602
I told you they'd be reading
our names in the paper.

844
01:00:03.604 --> 01:00:05.207
Congratulations to you.

845
01:00:05.209 --> 01:00:07.603
I. too. am a horse breeder.

846
01:00:07.605 --> 01:00:11.620
though I have not had the good
fortune you have experienced.

847
01:00:11.622 --> 01:00:15.135
I will be in San Antonio for
several more days on business.

848
01:00:15.937 --> 01:00:18.621
I'd much like to purchase
some stock from you.

849
01:00:18.623 --> 01:00:20.589
I was so...

850
01:00:23.063 --> 01:00:24.020
It's "impressed."

851
01:00:24.022 --> 01:00:25.748
Yeah. I know what it says. Waylon.

852
01:00:26.604 --> 01:00:29.458
"Impressed with your horse
and the story I read of.

853
01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:32.206
we wanted to buy your stock sight unseen."

854
01:00:32.208 --> 01:00:36.705
Well. you hear that? "Sight unseen."

855
01:00:36.707 --> 01:00:38.928
For a horse breeder.
that's not too bright.

856
01:00:42.877 --> 01:00:45.877
Well. I reckon we know a thing or two

857
01:00:45.879 --> 01:00:47.497
about making money off of texans.

858
01:00:47.499 --> 01:00:50.614
and we're going to San Antonio
for just a couple of days.

859
01:00:50.616 --> 01:00:52.446
Set it up. Let's do it.

860
01:00:52.448 --> 01:00:55.712
$1.000. we could us buy
two horses for that.

861
01:00:58.480 --> 01:00:59.480
Consider it done.

862
01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:15.724
Good afternoon. gentlemen.

863
01:01:15.726 --> 01:01:16.640
When your name is Ford

864
01:01:16.642 --> 01:01:19.453
and you own the finest racehorse in Texas.

865
01:01:19.455 --> 01:01:20.714
it's always a fine day.

866
01:01:22.610 --> 01:01:24.459
Racing man. huh?

867
01:01:24.461 --> 01:01:26.032
Yes. sir. I breed 'em.

868
01:01:26.034 --> 01:01:27.950
Finest stock this side of Kentucky.

869
01:01:27.952 --> 01:01:29.916
Just proved that a couple of days ago.

870
01:01:29.918 --> 01:01:31.834
This spring we're gonna
race her in the saratoga.

871
01:01:31.836 --> 01:01:34.394
and the whole world's gonna
know how great my stock is.

872
01:01:34.396 --> 01:01:35.396
Our stock.

873
01:01:37.484 --> 01:01:40.084
Well. that calls for
a drink on the house.

874
01:01:40.086 --> 01:01:41.832
That's mighty fine of you.

875
01:01:43.152 --> 01:01:44.152
- Bourbon?
- Bourbon.

876
01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:50.740
Whew.

877
01:01:52.398 --> 01:01:54.247
To the confederacy.

878
01:01:54.249 --> 01:01:56.759
And all those hard-nosed
southern sons of bitches

879
01:01:56.761 --> 01:01:58.524
who never buckled under.

880
01:01:58.526 --> 01:01:59.964
- Hear. hear.
- To the south.

881
01:02:03.973 --> 01:02:07.170
Mm.

882
01:02:08.188 --> 01:02:10.208
I'll have another.

883
01:02:10.210 --> 01:02:11.217
Yes. sir.

884
01:02:13.765 --> 01:02:16.424
Tastes like home.

885
01:02:18.196 --> 01:02:19.196
Gentlemen.

886
01:02:23.883 --> 01:02:25.881
Well. color me purple.

887
01:02:26.798 --> 01:02:27.885
You're tubby Ford.

888
01:02:29.129 --> 01:02:30.129
Tully.

889
01:02:30.874 --> 01:02:32.073
And you're Waylon Ford?

890
01:02:34.183 --> 01:02:36.751
You two own the southern
oil and gas company?

891
01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:38.324
That's right.

892
01:02:38.326 --> 01:02:40.185
Racehorses and oil fields.

893
01:02:40.187 --> 01:02:42.184
the best two vices on god's green earth.

894
01:02:45.596 --> 01:02:49.334
What brings two famous types
like you to this shit hole?

895
01:02:49.336 --> 01:02:51.894
Well. we were invited to your fair town.

896
01:02:51.896 --> 01:02:54.024
There's a horse breeder
who wants to purchase

897
01:02:54.026 --> 01:02:56.364
- some of my stock.
- Our stock.

898
01:02:56.366 --> 01:02:58.924
Of course. Waylon. our stock.

899
01:02:58.926 --> 01:03:02.794
And we're to meet him right
here in your fine saloon.

900
01:03:04.604 --> 01:03:06.453
- Redbone?
- That's right.

901
01:03:06.455 --> 01:03:08.793
My pride and joy. you must have
read about him in the paper.

902
01:03:08.795 --> 01:03:09.828
- Indeed.
- Mm.

903
01:03:11.346 --> 01:03:13.502
I've also hear that horse traders are

904
01:03:13.504 --> 01:03:15.516
some of the most low-life sons of bitches

905
01:03:15.518 --> 01:03:17.640
known to walk the face of the earth.

906
01:03:19.325 --> 01:03:23.236
Yeah? Who would say something like that?

907
01:03:23.238 --> 01:03:25.696
Well. they come through
here from time to time.

908
01:03:27.132 --> 01:03:28.511
I don't see many smiling faces.

909
01:03:28.513 --> 01:03:30.697
- I can tell you that.
- Hmm.

910
01:03:30.699 --> 01:03:33.076
Let me tell you something. barman.

911
01:03:33.078 --> 01:03:34.811
This is not a poor man's game.

912
01:03:34.813 --> 01:03:36.778
Not many folks can afford this business.

913
01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:38.283
and if you can't run with the big dogs.

914
01:03:38.285 --> 01:03:39.799
stay under the porch.

915
01:03:39.801 --> 01:03:41.966
This fellow knows what I have for sale.

916
01:03:41.968 --> 01:03:43.740
We'll be walking outta
here with one less horse

917
01:03:43.742 --> 01:03:45.037
and a whole lot more money.

918
01:03:46.450 --> 01:03:47.955
Well. where's your buyer?

919
01:03:48.885 --> 01:03:50.487
Well. that I do not know.

920
01:03:52.843 --> 01:03:53.640
But you know what?

921
01:03:53.642 --> 01:03:56.192
As long as you've got
more of this fine bourbon.

922
01:03:56.194 --> 01:03:58.212
I reckon he can just take his sweet time.

923
01:03:58.214 --> 01:03:59.307
Come on. Waylon.

924
01:04:06.322 --> 01:04:09.749
- I don't understand.
- Which part?

925
01:04:09.751 --> 01:04:11.717
You think this will get your gold back?

926
01:04:16.191 --> 01:04:17.729
If it goes as planned. yes.

927
01:04:17.731 --> 01:04:19.205
Huck's gonna let me know
when they're good and drunk.

928
01:04:19.207 --> 01:04:20.227
And then what?

929
01:04:21.998 --> 01:04:23.416
It's best if you don't know.

930
01:04:23.418 --> 01:04:24.960
I don't want you involved in it.

931
01:04:24.962 --> 01:04:26.254
I'm already involved.

932
01:04:26.256 --> 01:04:27.348
I don't want you anywhere near me

933
01:04:27.350 --> 01:04:29.220
- when that shooting starts.
- Shooting?

934
01:04:31.330 --> 01:04:35.404
I'm posing as a businessman
looking to buy racing stock.

935
01:04:35.406 --> 01:04:36.203
He's gonna meet me.

936
01:04:36.205 --> 01:04:38.290
I'm gonna confront him about the money.

937
01:04:38.292 --> 01:04:39.834
It's either that or I kill them.

938
01:04:39.836 --> 01:04:41.096
Kill them? Oh!

939
01:04:44.469 --> 01:04:46.006
They took everything from us.

940
01:04:47.993 --> 01:04:49.428
Don't you understand that?

941
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:50.655
I don't think this is a good idea.

942
01:04:50.657 --> 01:04:53.213
You wanted to find Jim Orville bain?

943
01:04:53.215 --> 01:04:54.882
This is how we do it.

944
01:04:54.884 --> 01:04:55.908
This is not what I had in mind.

945
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:58.584
dios mio. to be a widow at 40 years old.

946
01:04:58.586 --> 01:05:01.834
When I rescued you in
Jackson. that was Jim.

947
01:05:03.762 --> 01:05:04.769
You have to trust me.

948
01:05:05.644 --> 01:05:06.651
This is the only way.

949
01:05:11.692 --> 01:05:15.036
No. Jim. We could run away to Mexico.

950
01:05:17.239 --> 01:05:18.091
My father would give
us a house to live in.

951
01:05:18.093 --> 01:05:20.728
You would have a lifetime job.

952
01:05:20.730 --> 01:05:22.253
You could take over the ranch someday.

953
01:05:22.255 --> 01:05:23.293
We could talk to him.

954
01:05:25.868 --> 01:05:27.436
If I go to Mexico. I'm dead already.

955
01:05:28.328 --> 01:05:29.448
You know that.

956
01:05:30.512 --> 01:05:31.335
You gotta trust me.

957
01:05:31.337 --> 01:05:32.443
This is the only way.

958
01:05:35.892 --> 01:05:37.964
You just promise me
you'll stay right here.

959
01:05:40.491 --> 01:05:41.929
Okay. I promise.

960
01:05:42.847 --> 01:05:44.765
But you come back to me.

961
01:05:46.318 --> 01:05:47.318
I promise.

962
01:05:52.552 --> 01:05:53.552
I promise.

963
01:06:24.387 --> 01:06:25.387
Yeah.

964
01:06:26.448 --> 01:06:30.373
Barman! Another bottle. if you please.

965
01:06:30.375 --> 01:06:32.651
None of that rot-your-guts coffin varnish.

966
01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:36.065
I want more of that
bourbon. if you don't mind.

967
01:06:37.894 --> 01:06:39.844
- Coming right up.
- Yeah.

968
01:06:41.804 --> 01:06:42.804
Well...

969
01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:46.867
If you two don't plan
on draining that bottle.

970
01:06:46.869 --> 01:06:48.125
I don't mind a little rum brave.

971
01:06:48.127 --> 01:06:51.136
but I got no room for stupid drunks.

972
01:06:53.958 --> 01:06:56.553
You know what we need?

973
01:06:56.555 --> 01:06:57.352
- We need whores.
- Yeah.

974
01:06:57.354 --> 01:06:58.881
You got any whores?

975
01:06:58.883 --> 01:07:00.276
No. I'm afraid we don't provide

976
01:07:00.278 --> 01:07:02.355
that type of service around here anymore.

977
01:07:02.357 --> 01:07:04.886
What the hell kind
of place you run around here?

978
01:07:04.888 --> 01:07:07.076
You ain't got no whores?

979
01:07:07.078 --> 01:07:08.706
Just alcohol and cigars.

980
01:07:08.708 --> 01:07:12.504
It's family establishment.

981
01:07:12.506 --> 01:07:14.743
Barman. do you mind giving
us a little bit of privacy?

982
01:07:18.397 --> 01:07:21.461
I ain't even seen a
woman around here all day.

983
01:07:21.463 --> 01:07:22.463
No.

984
01:07:25.798 --> 01:07:26.917
No whores...

985
01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:39.904
Howdy. Could I get a beer?

986
01:07:42.687 --> 01:07:45.054
- There you go.
- Much obliged.

987
01:07:45.056 --> 01:07:46.255
Hey. big fella?

988
01:07:47.223 --> 01:07:48.410
Yeah. why don't you come over here?

989
01:07:48.412 --> 01:07:49.910
I wanna talk to you.

990
01:07:49.912 --> 01:07:51.670
- Me?
- Yeah. Come on.

991
01:07:54.291 --> 01:07:55.291
Sit.

992
01:07:57.955 --> 01:08:00.026
- You've got yourself a drink?
- Yes. sir.

993
01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:03.050
Alright. what's your name. big man?

994
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:05.390
Bud Rogers.

995
01:08:06.011 --> 01:08:08.157
- Bud Rogers.
- Yes. sir.

996
01:08:08.159 --> 01:08:08.956
Waylon and Tully.

997
01:08:08.958 --> 01:08:10.675
Were you ever in the army. bud?

998
01:08:11.842 --> 01:08:13.502
No. sir. I'm a farmer.

999
01:08:13.504 --> 01:08:15.139
- Farmer?
- Yes. sir.

1000
01:08:15.141 --> 01:08:17.584
We're farmers. too. What's your crop?

1001
01:08:17.586 --> 01:08:19.330
- Corn. mostly.
- Ah. it don't matter.

1002
01:08:19.332 --> 01:08:20.970
Do you got any reason to believe

1003
01:08:20.972 --> 01:08:23.046
there might be oil underneath that crop?

1004
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000
- No. sir.
- No?

1005
01:08:28.078 --> 01:08:29.688
Boy. you could be shitting in high cotton

1006
01:08:29.690 --> 01:08:30.800
and not even know it.

1007
01:08:30.802 --> 01:08:34.550
My brother here could make
you a very. very rich man.

1008
01:08:34.552 --> 01:08:35.354
That's right.

1009
01:08:35.356 --> 01:08:36.476
- Go on.
- Sir?

1010
01:08:38.488 --> 01:08:39.853
He don't know what oil is. I reckon.

1011
01:08:39.855 --> 01:08:41.465
You know. it's neither here nor there.

1012
01:08:41.467 --> 01:08:43.104
I want to put some money
in your pocket tonight.

1013
01:08:43.106 --> 01:08:44.106
How's that sound?

1014
01:08:45.945 --> 01:08:46.806
What do y'all want me to do?

1015
01:08:46.808 --> 01:08:47.689
Yeah. Here's the deal.

1016
01:08:47.691 --> 01:08:50.393
We're gonna go on a business transaction

1017
01:08:50.395 --> 01:08:51.841
here with a complete stranger.

1018
01:08:51.843 --> 01:08:55.850
and let's just say that
the stakes are high.

1019
01:08:55.852 --> 01:08:57.358
Now what I want you to do

1020
01:08:58.279 --> 01:09:00.815
is stand behind my brother Waylon here.

1021
01:09:00.817 --> 01:09:01.968
You know. with a pistol.

1022
01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:05.916
Why would I do that?

1023
01:09:05.918 --> 01:09:07.836
Because you look mean.

1024
01:09:08.914 --> 01:09:11.408
Do you want to earn a
little money tonight or not?

1025
01:09:13.192 --> 01:09:14.216
Maybe. yeah.

1026
01:09:14.218 --> 01:09:16.700
Yeah. this is. this is fine.

1027
01:09:16.702 --> 01:09:17.745
I'm too drunk for this.

1028
01:09:17.747 --> 01:09:19.174
I'm drunk as a fool now.

1029
01:09:19.176 --> 01:09:20.969
And you're stout as a mule. You know?

1030
01:09:21.797 --> 01:09:23.060
What I want you to do

1031
01:09:24.393 --> 01:09:27.240
is to stand behind Waylon
here with a pistol.

1032
01:09:27.242 --> 01:09:28.726
Now. if everything goes well.

1033
01:09:28.728 --> 01:09:31.478
we're gonna walk out of here
richer than what we came in.

1034
01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:32.955
We're gonna sell this dumb old horse.

1035
01:09:32.957 --> 01:09:34.979
Of course. if it doesn't go well.

1036
01:09:34.981 --> 01:09:37.281
I'm gonna shoot some asshole.

1037
01:09:37.283 --> 01:09:39.458
take the next train to waco. I reckon.

1038
01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:41.440
Either way. you'll make
$50 just to sit there

1039
01:09:41.442 --> 01:09:43.538
all stupid with a pistol in your hand now.

1040
01:09:46.048 --> 01:09:49.096
- Alright. Sounds good.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1041
01:09:49.098 --> 01:09:49.895
- Good man.
- No big deal.

1042
01:09:49.897 --> 01:09:52.270
- Yes. sir.
- We do this all the time.

1043
01:09:52.272 --> 01:09:55.512
Ain't nothing gonna happen.

1044
01:09:55.514 --> 01:09:56.855
More than likely. he's legit.

1045
01:09:56.857 --> 01:10:00.892
You just gotta be extra
cautious in this odd world.

1046
01:10:00.894 --> 01:10:04.167
There's a lot of crooks out there.

1047
01:10:05.248 --> 01:10:06.735
No honor among thieves.

1048
01:10:07.598 --> 01:10:10.328
Exactly! Who said that?

1049
01:10:12.019 --> 01:10:13.715
Now. who might you be?

1050
01:10:13.717 --> 01:10:16.585
- Just a man.
- "Just a man."

1051
01:10:16.587 --> 01:10:19.191
Just a man looking for a horse.

1052
01:10:19.193 --> 01:10:20.610
Oh. you sent the letter!

1053
01:10:20.612 --> 01:10:21.972
Come on over here. boy.

1054
01:10:21.974 --> 01:10:23.141
Been waiting on you.

1055
01:10:24.184 --> 01:10:25.875
Get yourself a drink.

1056
01:10:25.877 --> 01:10:27.131
No. thank you.

1057
01:10:27.133 --> 01:10:28.628
Well. why don't you come a little closer

1058
01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:30.747
where we can get a look at you?

1059
01:10:30.749 --> 01:10:31.804
You bring the horse?

1060
01:10:32.677 --> 01:10:34.765
The letter said "sight unseen."

1061
01:10:35.976 --> 01:10:37.249
No horse. no deal.

1062
01:10:37.251 --> 01:10:38.048
Now. now. now. now wait a minute.

1063
01:10:38.050 --> 01:10:39.057
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

1064
01:10:40.762 --> 01:10:43.627
Now look. mister. I don't
even know what to call you.

1065
01:10:43.629 --> 01:10:45.967
- first of all.
- Bain.

1066
01:10:45.969 --> 01:10:48.844
- Bain?
- James Orville bain.

1067
01:10:48.846 --> 01:10:52.628
Okay. Jim Orville bain. Some name.

1068
01:10:53.459 --> 01:10:55.034
You don't remember me. do you?

1069
01:11:02.379 --> 01:11:04.213
- Tully?
- Huh?

1070
01:11:04.215 --> 01:11:05.512
That's the old boy we robbed.

1071
01:11:05.514 --> 01:11:06.514
Shut up. Waylon.

1072
01:11:08.276 --> 01:11:11.478
This place serves the strongest shit

1073
01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:12.523
this side of Mississippi.

1074
01:11:12.525 --> 01:11:14.307
I believe I'm seeing a ghost.

1075
01:11:14.309 --> 01:11:15.309
No ghost.

1076
01:11:16.716 --> 01:11:18.250
You robbed me outside that bank.

1077
01:11:20.075 --> 01:11:22.141
a saddle full of Mexican gold.

1078
01:11:24.057 --> 01:11:25.902
Mexican gold. huh?

1079
01:11:30.162 --> 01:11:31.162
God damn it!

1080
01:11:34.291 --> 01:11:37.410
Why don't you tell me what it
is that you want. Jim bain?

1081
01:11:37.412 --> 01:11:40.249
I want that gold you stole
from you. you son of a bitch.

1082
01:11:40.251 --> 01:11:43.490
Major arliss beauregard's
gold that you stole?

1083
01:11:43.492 --> 01:11:44.675
You killed him.

1084
01:11:46.235 --> 01:11:48.516
I was just doing the lord's work.

1085
01:11:48.518 --> 01:11:51.794
Beauregard is rotting in the
pits of hell right now. boy.

1086
01:11:51.796 --> 01:11:52.764
And you're about to join him.

1087
01:11:52.766 --> 01:11:55.171
You're a god danged traitor. bain.

1088
01:11:55.173 --> 01:11:59.607
See. we needed men like you
to help fight for the cause.

1089
01:12:03.401 --> 01:12:06.794
You tucked tail and ran like
a bitch with a skinned knee.

1090
01:12:09.864 --> 01:12:13.571
Waylon. the younger. weaker brother.

1091
01:12:14.690 --> 01:12:15.985
There always is one. right?

1092
01:12:16.963 --> 01:12:18.246
That war was over before it started.

1093
01:12:18.248 --> 01:12:19.680
you stupid son of a bitch.

1094
01:12:21.223 --> 01:12:23.070
It just took you hillbillies
about four years too late

1095
01:12:23.072 --> 01:12:24.086
to figure it out. that's all.

1096
01:12:24.088 --> 01:12:26.213
Why you piece of shit.

1097
01:12:26.215 --> 01:12:28.318
No!

1098
01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:30.550
You shot Waylon. you son of a bitch!

1099
01:12:30.552 --> 01:12:33.825
Easy there. oilman. or you'll be next.

1100
01:12:33.827 --> 01:12:36.464
Damn it! He shot me in the leg!

1101
01:12:41.606 --> 01:12:42.701
If you don't get help right now.

1102
01:12:42.703 --> 01:12:45.089
he'll bleed out and that's on your hands.

1103
01:12:45.091 --> 01:12:46.672
I guarantee he won't be lonely.

1104
01:12:46.674 --> 01:12:48.264
You'll burn for this. Jim bain.

1105
01:12:48.266 --> 01:12:49.952
Maybe. maybe not.

1106
01:12:49.954 --> 01:12:52.541
My company will send men for you.

1107
01:12:52.543 --> 01:12:54.104
They will kill you.

1108
01:12:54.106 --> 01:12:55.984
They'll kill all of you.

1109
01:12:55.986 --> 01:12:58.880
and anyone in 50 miles who looks like you.

1110
01:12:58.882 --> 01:13:01.010
and burn their god damned house down.

1111
01:13:01.012 --> 01:13:04.390
With the wife and the kids
and the family dog inside.

1112
01:13:05.298 --> 01:13:08.058
Before they kick you off a high tree.

1113
01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:09.689
you'll get to watch them take turns

1114
01:13:09.691 --> 01:13:12.144
with that sweet Mexican wife of yours.

1115
01:13:12.146 --> 01:13:14.441
over and over and over.

1116
01:13:15.754 --> 01:13:19.750
Yeah. ain't like we
haven't already had a taste.

1117
01:13:20.909 --> 01:13:21.909
No!

1118
01:13:26.090 --> 01:13:27.090
Waylon...

1119
01:13:35.707 --> 01:13:37.122
$10.000?

1120
01:13:38.165 --> 01:13:40.723
Plus interest. 1.000 a year.

1121
01:13:40.725 --> 01:13:43.107
I don't have your gold. Jim bain.

1122
01:13:44.154 --> 01:13:48.002
All I've got for you is lead.
and I'm feeling generous.

1123
01:13:49.807 --> 01:13:51.858
You want to finish this?

1124
01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:53.928
We do it in the street. like men.

1125
01:13:56.428 --> 01:13:57.547
Let's do it.

1126
01:14:10.853 --> 01:14:13.264
Why don't you call off your dogs?

1127
01:14:13.266 --> 01:14:14.678
Make this a fair fight.

1128
01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:44.811
Guess this ain't your day.

1129
01:14:45.828 --> 01:14:50.623
How embarrassing.
you all dead in the street.

1130
01:14:50.668 --> 01:14:53.323
and me going to have my way

1131
01:14:53.325 --> 01:14:56.629
with that fiery little Mexican
bitch you were so fond of.

1132
01:14:59.501 --> 01:15:01.398
Speak of the devil.

1133
01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:02.951
Hands up.

1134
01:15:02.953 --> 01:15:04.246
Now easy there. precious.

1135
01:15:04.248 --> 01:15:05.661
Don't do nothing foolish.

1136
01:15:07.001 --> 01:15:08.025
Lord have mercy.

1137
01:15:08.027 --> 01:15:10.720
You know how to handle that big old gun?

1138
01:15:10.722 --> 01:15:11.519
Don't worry about me.

1139
01:15:11.521 --> 01:15:13.223
You worry about yourself.

1140
01:15:13.225 --> 01:15:14.604
You're the one with it pointed at you.

1141
01:15:14.606 --> 01:15:16.493
Now. let's be reasonable.

1142
01:15:16.495 --> 01:15:19.054
We all came here to make a deal. right?

1143
01:15:19.056 --> 01:15:21.269
So let's make one. What do you say?

1144
01:15:21.271 --> 01:15:24.539
- Deal?
- I'm a businessman.

1145
01:15:24.541 --> 01:15:25.901
I'm sure we can find us a way

1146
01:15:25.903 --> 01:15:29.694
that everybody walks out of
this mess alive. except him.

1147
01:15:30.593 --> 01:15:32.432
Your husband killed my brother.

1148
01:15:32.434 --> 01:15:35.290
Meeting his end was his own fault.

1149
01:15:35.292 --> 01:15:39.529
I dare you to find a Texas
judge that'll say otherwise.

1150
01:15:39.531 --> 01:15:42.047
My husband didn't call
you here to make a deal.

1151
01:15:43.185 --> 01:15:44.483
He came here to kill you.

1152
01:15:45.612 --> 01:15:46.612
But he didn't.

1153
01:15:47.338 --> 01:15:49.997
You have $10.000 of Mexican
gold that belongs to him.

1154
01:15:51.088 --> 01:15:53.186
He's gone. it should come to me.

1155
01:15:53.188 --> 01:15:55.646
Is that right? Bless your heart.

1156
01:15:57.130 --> 01:16:00.355
Okay. Don't get your
peppers in a wad. seniorita.

1157
01:16:02.462 --> 01:16:04.877
Now my bank is a right
far piece from here.

1158
01:16:04.879 --> 01:16:07.303
I'm afraid you will
have to accept a check.

1159
01:16:07.305 --> 01:16:08.305
Cash.

1160
01:16:09.252 --> 01:16:11.384
- Cash?
- Plus interest.

1161
01:16:12.946 --> 01:16:16.773
What the hell
do you know about interest?

1162
01:16:18.123 --> 01:16:22.063
Okay. interest. what do you think is fair?

1163
01:16:22.065 --> 01:16:24.575
An extra $5.000.

1164
01:16:24.577 --> 01:16:27.287
$5.000 seems a bit steep.

1165
01:16:27.289 --> 01:16:31.121
$10.000. and I Bury you without a head.

1166
01:16:32.144 --> 01:16:33.494
The extra five. I leave it where it is.

1167
01:16:33.496 --> 01:16:36.271
Same goes for the man inside. Your choice.

1168
01:16:37.198 --> 01:16:39.656
The former Mrs. Bain
drives a hell of a bargain.

1169
01:16:43.672 --> 01:16:45.590
That's why I stopped arguing with her.

1170
01:16:50.778 --> 01:16:52.847
Checkbook. get it out.

1171
01:17:03.013 --> 01:17:04.372
Marisol. take it.

1172
01:17:05.831 --> 01:17:07.510
What are you doing?

1173
01:17:11.011 --> 01:17:14.032
You win. Jim bain. You win.

1174
01:17:15.915 --> 01:17:20.710
Just get me the hell out of
Texas so I can Bury my brother.

1175
01:17:21.305 --> 01:17:23.486
At least give me that.

1176
01:17:23.488 --> 01:17:25.026
I'm just doing the lord's work.

1177
01:17:31.294 --> 01:17:34.374
Oh god. You're hurt real bad.

1178
01:17:34.376 --> 01:17:37.501
Bud. run out for a doctor. Oh...

1179
01:17:37.503 --> 01:17:39.227
The check. Where the check?

1180
01:17:39.229 --> 01:17:40.646
It's right here. Don't worry.

1181
01:17:40.648 --> 01:17:41.855
Don't worry about that. okay?

1182
01:17:41.857 --> 01:17:43.255
Just stay with me.

1183
01:17:43.257 --> 01:17:44.545
Be still. Stay with me.

1184
01:17:44.547 --> 01:17:46.320
Take his hand.

1185
01:17:46.322 --> 01:17:48.588
take his hand and sign it.

1186
01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:50.211
- Okay.
- Make him sign his name.

1187
01:17:50.213 --> 01:17:51.727
Okay.

1188
01:17:51.729 --> 01:17:55.923
I want you to cash that
before you go to Mexico.

1189
01:17:55.925 --> 01:17:56.722
Jim. you're scaring me.

1190
01:17:56.724 --> 01:17:58.679
Don't talk like that.
Don't talk like that.

1191
01:17:58.681 --> 01:18:01.372
You're going to be
okay. Just stay with me.

1192
01:18:01.374 --> 01:18:03.060
- Where are you?
- Stay with me.

1193
01:18:03.062 --> 01:18:05.816
Jim? Jim?

1194
01:18:07.243 --> 01:18:09.023
God damn. you're beautiful.

1195
01:18:09.025 --> 01:18:10.624
You're so beautiful.

1196
01:18:11.941 --> 01:18:15.617
Jim. stay. Jim...

1197
01:18:20.425 --> 01:18:21.425
Jim!

1198
01:18:24.079 --> 01:18:25.079
Jim?

1199
01:18:25.809 --> 01:18:26.809
Jim!

1200
01:18:36.266 --> 01:18:37.063
Good morning.

1201
01:18:37.065 --> 01:18:39.740
Well. I'm just stopping by to see you.

1202
01:18:39.742 --> 01:18:41.277
You look lovely today.

1203
01:18:41.279 --> 01:18:42.323
Thank you.

1204
01:18:42.325 --> 01:18:44.902
I sure am going to miss
your smiling face around here.

1205
01:18:44.904 --> 01:18:46.726
You're always kind. always a friend.

1206
01:18:47.561 --> 01:18:50.102
Is there anything I can
do to convince you to stay?

1207
01:18:51.644 --> 01:18:54.354
No. Mexico is my new home.

1208
01:18:55.406 --> 01:18:57.228
Maybe some day you can pay us a visit.

1209
01:18:58.379 --> 01:19:01.136
Well. you tell Ramiro I
said "hello." would you?

1210
01:19:01.138 --> 01:19:03.766
I will.

1211
01:19:03.768 --> 01:19:05.320
Are you ready?

1212
01:19:07.396 --> 01:19:08.396
I think so.

1213
01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:10.789
I'll give you a moment.

1214
01:19:16.255 --> 01:19:17.255
So how's the arm?

1215
01:19:18.269 --> 01:19:19.269
Hurts like hell.

1216
01:19:20.043 --> 01:19:22.089
The Mexican air ought
to do it some good.

1217
01:19:23.077 --> 01:19:25.649
I always pictured old Jim bain dressed in

1218
01:19:25.651 --> 01:19:27.699
one of those Mexican farmer suits.

1219
01:19:29.499 --> 01:19:31.105
That'll be the day.

1220
01:19:31.107 --> 01:19:32.638
That'll be something.

1221
01:19:36.242 --> 01:19:37.999
Thank you for everything.

1222
01:19:40.039 --> 01:19:42.047
You take care of that
woman. You hear me?

1223
01:19:45.507 --> 01:19:48.702
If you ever decide to
donate any of that $15.000.

1224
01:19:49.682 --> 01:19:52.538
I know an old. worn-out saloon
that could use some help.

1225
01:19:55.413 --> 01:19:59.002
Huck. check the register.
