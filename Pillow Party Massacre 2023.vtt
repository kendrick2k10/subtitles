Oh. speaking of shitty

enough

deal with that bullshit.

and here they all are.

about her.

performative fucking shit.

233
00:17:01.468 --> 00:17:03.125
- Yeah. that's precisely the
reason I

234
00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.816
didn't wanna have a wake.

235
00:17:04.851 --> 00:17:07.095

are blowing up my phone

Bridge Lake like nothing.

If there was just one goddamn
thing I wish we would do

240
00:17:21.419 --> 00:17:25.320
is to talk about what
is actually happening.

241
00:17:25.354 --> 00:17:29.289
- I'm confused. Are you
still complaining about Mom?

242
00:17:29.324 --> 00:17:32.465
- All of it. everything. I don't
know.

243
00:17:34.467 --> 00:17:38.402
Sometimes I do feel like
I am completely alone.

244
00:17:39.886 --> 00:17:41.750

there

not pretending the world isn't
turning.

246
00:17:44.753 --> 00:17:47.273
- Is that gonna make it any
better?

00:17:47.307 --> 00:17:48.584
- What?

248
00:17:48.619 --> 00:17:50.897
- Like. if you acknowledge it
and. and wallow in this shit.

249
00:17:50.931 --> 00:17:53.589
is that gonna make you feel
better?

250
00:17:53.624 --> 00:17:57.766
- I think it would give us
some closure by facing it.

251

- Filthy female cow. Make it
laugh.

252
00:18:01.563 --> 00:18:05.601

problem doesn't always mean

253
00:18:05.636 --> 00:18:07.707
that you've conquered it.

255
00:18:12.815 --> 00:18:14.300
But I gotta tell ya.

256
00:18:14.334 --> 00:18:17.613
if you're gonna spend
my summer fee fi foeing

257
00:18:17.648 --> 00:18:19.408
around Grandma's house.

258
00:18:19.443 --> 00:18:22.894
it's gonna send my brain
into hyper drive mode.

259
00:18:22.929 --> 00:18:26.588
and the only way that I
can purge that from myself

260
00:18:26.622 --> 00:18:29.315
is to blow it out with a bullet.

261
00:18:29.349 --> 00:18:30.868
- [sighs] You're such a dick.

262

like to go to another wake

with all of our family
members blathering on

264
00:18:37.702 --> 00:18:40.843
about how great and wonderful I
am.

265
00:18:40.878 --> 00:18:44.640

couple

with your fucking friends.

imagine her

275
00:19:20.987 --> 00:19:25.647
in some padded room the minute
we walk into that place?

probably will. all of you.

want now?

278

279
00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.598
- Not one of them will even
mention it.

to?

copes the same way you do.

282
00:19:54.952 --> 00:19:57.610
and odds are you're probably

00:19:57.644 --> 00:19:59.715

feel shitty.

maybe you can take some
comfort in the fact that.

287
00:20:09.725 --> 00:20:13.798
by you being there. maybe they
have less shitty of a time.

deed for the summer.

353
00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.812
I haven't thought about that in
years.

- Holy fucking shit!

364
00:27:20.431 --> 00:27:23.400

[cars and truck whoosh past]

366
00:27:33.479 --> 00:27:37.000
- Hey. remind me why we come

00:27:37.034 --> 00:27:40.106
Because it's tradition. Sam.
Come on.

Excuse me. Hi. excuse me.

387
00:29:01.153 --> 00:29:05.364
I. I don't know if you
maybe want something to eat.

388
00:29:05.398 --> 00:29:09.540
but I do have like Corn
Nuts if. if you want them.

You. you wanna beer?

[soft tense music]

406
00:30:19.334 --> 00:30:22.337
I. I got this from a man in
Rumaila.

407
00:30:26.514 --> 00:30:30.173
He was a member of the
Iraqi Republican Guard.

408
00:30:30.207 --> 00:30:31.864
an older gentleman.

409
00:30:33.452 --> 00:30:35.454
He. he was injured by a mortar.

410
00:30:35.488 --> 00:30:39.458
and I pulled him to an American
med unit.

411
00:30:39.492 --> 00:30:44.221
and he gave me this coin and
said he got it from someone

412
00:30:45.188 --> 00:30:47.224
he'd given shelter to.

413
00:30:47.259 --> 00:30:51.608
Said next time someone does
something generous for me

414
00:30:52.954 --> 00:30:56.889
to give 'em this coin.
tell 'em to do the same.

415
00:30:57.717 --> 00:31:02.170
the idea of being. as long
as the coin keeps moving.

416
00:31:03.654 --> 00:31:05.001
there's still some good in the
world.

417

[phone rings]
[footsteps shuffle]

418
00:31:11.214 --> 00:31:13.181
- I can't take this.

419
00:31:13.216 --> 00:31:15.287
- Don't hang onto it too long.

420
00:31:15.321 --> 00:31:18.428
Don't let the coin stop
circulating.

421
00:31:18.462 --> 00:31:19.463
- Thank you.

422
00:31:21.431 --> 00:31:24.606

[footsteps shuffle]

425
00:31:29.542 --> 00:31:31.682
- No. what does that mean?

426
00:31:35.341 --> 00:31:38.310
Okay. well. then what should we
do?

427
00:31:41.554 --> 00:31:43.280
No. I mean. yes. yes.

428
00:31:43.315 --> 00:31:46.249
No. I'm glad you did too. Mom.
I...

429
00:31:47.284 --> 00:31:48.630
No. we will. we will.

430
00:31:48.665 --> 00:31:53.049
If you could just keep me
updated. that'd be great.

431
00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:56.086
Bye. Yeah. I love you.

432
00:31:56.121 --> 00:31:57.674
Bye.
- What's wrong?

433
00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:02.506
Well. this is fucking crazy.
- What?

434
00:32:02.541 --> 00:32:07.063
- You know that emergency
service announcement we got?

435
00:32:07.097 --> 00:32:11.722
Well. there was. there was a
breakout at Rainier Springs.

436
00:32:15.312 --> 00:32:16.520
- Wait. really?

437
00:32:18.384 --> 00:32:21.387
- Yeah. I mean. nothing's
confirmed.

438
00:32:23.424 --> 00:32:25.736
but my mom just wanted to
see if we saw it. you know.

439
00:32:25.771 --> 00:32:30.949
and she just. she still thinks
we should enjoy the weekend.

440
00:32:31.225 --> 00:32:33.572
not let it worry us too much.

441
00:32:34.538 --> 00:32:35.677
- Wow.
- Yeah.

442
00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:42.650
- Escaped prisoner. college
girls. and a cabin in the woods?

443
00:32:42.684 --> 00:32:44.341
I've seen this movie before.

444
00:32:44.376 --> 00:32:46.481
- Yeah. totally a horror movie.

445
00:32:46.516 --> 00:32:48.414
- Yeah. great. but this
isn't a horror movie.

446
00:32:48.449 --> 00:32:50.347
This is real life. so.

447
00:32:50.382 --> 00:32:53.040
- And statistically. you know.

448
00:32:53.074 --> 00:32:55.559
a house up on Burnt Bridge Lake.

449
00:32:55.594 --> 00:32:58.217
it's. it's like the
safest place you could be.

450
00:32:58.252 --> 00:32:59.356
- A fucking army could roll
through there

451
00:32:59.391 --> 00:33:01.980
and nobody would even find us.

452
00:33:03.084 --> 00:33:04.430
Come on.

458
00:33:19.376 --> 00:33:21.654
over 20 miles of forest road.

459
00:33:21.689 --> 00:33:23.622
Requesting additional

[doors open]
[girls grunt]

463
00:33:59.382 --> 00:34:01.522
- Shangri-La.
- Hamunaptra.

464
00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:04.835
- Well. hello again.
- Oh my God.

465
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:08.218
I'm so glad my mom kept
this house in the divorce!

[women laugh]
[footsteps shuffle]

467
00:34:14.914 --> 00:34:16.640
Huh.
- What?

468
00:34:16.675 --> 00:34:18.746
- Goddamn key isn't here.

469
00:34:22.129 --> 00:34:24.579
Huh. Well. if that isn't
sketchy.

470

[people speak indistinctly]
[door slams]

471
00:34:31.897 --> 00:34:34.072
Oh. Ron. you moron. God.

472
00:34:36.384 --> 00:34:38.869
- How is your brother anyway?
- Stupid.

473
00:34:38.904 --> 00:34:41.872
He's good. I guess they're
buying a place.

474
00:34:41.907 --> 00:34:44.220
- Still with Catherine Simmons?

475
00:34:44.254 --> 00:34:45.497
- Yep.

476
00:34:45.531 --> 00:34:47.568
- How's she?
- Still a cunt.

477
00:34:47.602 --> 00:34:48.603
[women laugh]

478
00:34:48.638 --> 00:34:51.227
Oh. yes! Oh my goodness. guys!

479
00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:56.784
- Need another beer yet?

480
00:34:56.818 --> 00:34:59.683
- Come on.
- What is this?

481
00:34:59.718 --> 00:35:01.892
What the. really? A cutting
board?

482
00:35:01.927 --> 00:35:04.792
God. fucking Ronald. Damn
brother.

483
00:35:05.827 --> 00:35:07.208
Stupid brother.

[cans clatter]

486
00:35:22.465 --> 00:35:24.812
- All right. What is this to?

487
00:35:25.951 --> 00:35:27.194
- Summer break!

488
00:35:27.228 --> 00:35:29.886
- [imitates buzzer] The answer
is not on the board. Miles.

489
00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:32.578
Alana. you got a better one?
- Gettin' fucking trashed!

490
00:35:32.613 --> 00:35:33.545
- Yeah!
- No. come on.

491
00:35:33.579 --> 00:35:35.719
We gotta have something better
than that.

492
00:35:35.754 --> 00:35:38.343
Let me think.
- Panther squad.

493
00:35:39.551 --> 00:35:41.277
- Panther squad. bitches!
- Ooh. Sam!

494
00:35:41.311 --> 00:35:43.589

- [Samantha] Cheer.

498
00:35:51.977 --> 00:35:53.703
- I'm surprised Mikki isn't
here.

499
00:35:53.737 --> 00:35:55.912
- I know. I thought she'd
beat us here by hours.

500
00:35:55.946 --> 00:35:58.777
- Someone should call her.

501
00:35:58.811 --> 00:36:01.607
- Let's see if you can
find the spot. Alana.

502
00:36:01.642 --> 00:36:04.886
- I mean. it's like right here.

503
00:36:04.921 --> 00:36:06.405
- If Mikki's still Mikki.

504
00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:10.306
she's probably lost and
we'll have to go find her.

505
00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:12.653
- Remember that one 4th of
July up here by ourselves

506
00:36:12.687 --> 00:36:14.655
and Mikki got lost at the
lake when the sun was setting?

507
00:36:14.689 --> 00:36:16.519
- Yeah. because you and her went

508
00:36:16.553 --> 00:36:19.349
for a walk completely shit
faced. right?

509
00:36:19.384 --> 00:36:20.695
- I wasn't.

510
00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:24.630
- Oh. I remember you being
drunk. like fucked kind of
drunk.

511
00:36:24.665 --> 00:36:26.701
- Oh. off that gross
malt stuff Ron bought us.

512
00:36:26.736 --> 00:36:28.807
- [Barbra] Oh God. [laughs]

513
00:36:28.841 --> 00:36:29.980
- I was not drunk.
- Found it!

514
00:36:30.015 --> 00:36:33.225
And then. and then we saw
you guys. then we all hid.

515
00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:35.848
and then Ashley jumped
out of the bushes at you.

516
00:36:35.883 --> 00:36:37.367
[women laugh]

517
00:36:37.402 --> 00:36:40.267
I knew you were there. I could
hear you.

518
00:36:40.301 --> 00:36:44.961
- And Mikki screamed so
loud that she peed herself.

519
00:36:44.995 --> 00:36:49.552
We had to come back and put
her in the bath. [laughs] Fuck.

520
00:36:49.586 --> 00:36:51.933
[soft music]

521
00:36:56.662 --> 00:37:01.322
God. was that the last time
we were up here altogether?

522
00:37:02.634 --> 00:37:03.497
- Yeah.

523
00:37:06.016 --> 00:37:08.640
Yeah. Mikki and Ashley didn't.

524
00:37:08.674 --> 00:37:10.676
didn't go for spring
break our senior year. so-

525
00:37:10.711 --> 00:37:13.679
- Didn't answer.
- She's probably close.

526
00:37:13.714 --> 00:37:16.958
- Yeah. at a service range on
the 101.

527
00:37:16.993 --> 00:37:19.720
- I call it. Miss Cleo.
- Mikki!

528
00:37:24.414 --> 00:37:26.692
- Oh. good afternoon. girls.

529
00:37:28.556 --> 00:37:30.420
Are your. your parents here

530
00:37:30.455 --> 00:37:32.905
or the owner of the residence.
maybe?

531
00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:34.666
- Well. yeah. it's my mom's
house.

532
00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:38.497
so is there something wrong?
- Oh. no. ma'am.

533
00:37:40.016 --> 00:37:42.329
We're with the National Park
Service.

534
00:37:42.363 --> 00:37:46.056
and we saw you guys headed up
this way.

535
00:37:46.091 --> 00:37:50.406
and we thought we'd just.
you know. stop in and.

536
00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:53.098
and let you guys know that
there is in fact still a.

537
00:37:53.132 --> 00:37:54.858
a burn ban and effect in the
area.

538
00:37:54.893 --> 00:37:58.345
So. you know. no campfires. no
grilling.

539
00:38:00.554 --> 00:38:03.108
I don't know if you ladies
or smokers. but. you know.

540
00:38:03.142 --> 00:38:06.422
just put your butts
out before tossing 'em.

541
00:38:06.456 --> 00:38:07.664
- Okay. thanks.

542
00:38:08.562 --> 00:38:11.289
- Yeah. like I said. we're just.

543
00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:17.364
just doing a general welfare
check of the area and-

544
00:38:19.124 --> 00:38:20.884
- You know. sorry to bother you.
ladies.

545
00:38:20.919 --> 00:38:23.370
- Yeah.
- Thank you for your time.

546
00:38:23.404 --> 00:38:26.096
Come on. Shawna.
- Okay. thanks.

547
00:38:26.131 --> 00:38:27.650
- Oh. wait. wait.

548
00:38:29.755 --> 00:38:33.069
So we got that emergency
service alert or whatever.

549
00:38:33.103 --> 00:38:38.108
[soft tense music]
[birds caw]

550
00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:40.697
- Okay.
- Yeah.

551
00:38:40.732 --> 00:38:44.529
So do you know anything about it
or?

552
00:38:44.563 --> 00:38:47.877
- Nah. I wouldn't worry about
that. Everything's okay.

553
00:38:47.911 --> 00:38:50.569
- Was it really a prison break?

554
00:38:52.813 --> 00:38:56.472
- Well. we don't have any
concrete information right now.

555
00:38:56.506 --> 00:39:00.096
and nothing's been confirmed.
so. again.

556
00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:00.993
nothing to worry about.

557
00:39:01.028 --> 00:39:02.201
Just have a great rest of your
evening.

558
00:39:02.236 --> 00:39:06.067
- Yeah. I mean. unless it's
Bear Grylls that escaped.

559
00:39:06.102 --> 00:39:08.104
think you guys are in a
pretty good spot. [laughs]

560
00:39:08.138 --> 00:39:10.796
- Anyway. have a great
rest of your evening.

561
00:39:10.831 --> 00:39:11.797
Sorry to bother you ladies.

562
00:39:11.832 --> 00:39:15.387
and keep that drinking to a
minimum. okay?

563
00:39:15.422 --> 00:39:17.044
- Okay.
- Have. have fun. [laughs]

564
00:39:17.078 --> 00:39:18.563
- Come on. Shawna.
- Thank you.

565
00:39:18.597 --> 00:39:20.772
- Yeah. Blue Lives Matter or
whatever.

566
00:39:20.806 --> 00:39:21.669
- Sh!

567
00:39:22.739 --> 00:39:24.672
Sh sh sh!
- What?

568
00:39:24.707 --> 00:39:26.536
- Are you trying to get us in
trouble?

569
00:39:26.571 --> 00:39:28.607
- Oh. fuck them.

570
00:39:28.642 --> 00:39:30.540
- You gotta be fucking kidding
me.

571
00:39:30.575 --> 00:39:31.438
- What?

572
00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:34.786
- I've got four delicious
little girls up in this cabin.

573
00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:38.203
I mean. what is this. the
Washington Chainsaw Massacre?

574
00:39:38.237 --> 00:39:39.066
- Well. that's what happens

575
00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:41.033
when you only have two peace
officers

576
00:39:41.068 --> 00:39:43.622
covering 20 square miles of
forest land.

577
00:39:43.657 --> 00:39:46.901
[tense dark music]

578
00:39:46.936 --> 00:39:48.489
It'll be fine.

579
00:39:48.524 --> 00:39:50.802
[birds caw]

580
00:39:57.533 --> 00:39:58.913
- What side of the bed do you
want?

581
00:39:58.948 --> 00:40:00.087
[soft ethereal music]

582
00:40:00.121 --> 00:40:05.126
[bag thuds]
[Miles chuckles]

583
00:40:14.066 --> 00:40:17.553
Apologies in advance.
but I just gotta say it.

584
00:40:17.587 --> 00:40:21.522
It's gonna be a little
weird without Ashley here.

585
00:40:21.557 --> 00:40:23.179
I know. it's. it's...

586
00:40:25.837 --> 00:40:29.841
I just had to say it.
- No. I'm so glad you did.

587
00:40:32.084 --> 00:40:35.502
I've been thinking the exact
same thing.

588
00:40:35.536 --> 00:40:39.126
It's. it's almost why I didn't
come. if I'm being honest.

589
00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:42.854
- I'm glad you decided
to. I miss you. Sam.

590
00:40:42.888 --> 00:40:46.098
- I miss you. too. and I am
having fun.

591
00:40:47.134 --> 00:40:48.722
- [Miles] Me. too.

592
00:40:51.794 --> 00:40:55.591
- Does it. does it ever
make you feel guilty?

593
00:40:58.697 --> 00:41:03.840
You know. that you're happy?
Does that even make sense?

594
00:41:03.875 --> 00:41:07.603
- Sorta. I think I know what you
mean.

595
00:41:07.637 --> 00:41:09.846
- You know. it's like with my
mom.

596
00:41:09.881 --> 00:41:13.229
You know. I. I feel guilty that
I'm okay.

597
00:41:15.058 --> 00:41:16.888
Everyone keeps saying how bad
they feel.

598
00:41:16.922 --> 00:41:21.548
and it's not that I feel
good or that I'm not sad.

599
00:41:21.582 --> 00:41:23.273
but. you know.
- Yeah.

600
00:41:25.759 --> 00:41:29.210
- Our relationship was
not the best. but still.

601
00:41:29.245 --> 00:41:32.144
I don't know. I feel like
karma is gonna come for me.

602
00:41:32.179 --> 00:41:34.906
and same with Ashley. you know?

603
00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:37.529
I mean. we. how do I say this?

604
00:41:42.361 --> 00:41:46.296
Nothing happened to us. You
know. everyone felt bad for us.

605
00:41:46.331 --> 00:41:47.297
We were the victims.

606
00:41:47.332 --> 00:41:50.197
Everyone held our hand. and. I
don't know.

607
00:41:50.231 --> 00:41:52.579
I feel guilty that I can come
here

608
00:41:52.613 --> 00:41:54.822
and. and be happy. you know?

609
00:41:54.857 --> 00:41:57.031
And I need to know that
I'm not the only one who.

610
00:41:57.066 --> 00:41:59.275
who sees it for what it is.

611
00:42:00.587 --> 00:42:01.588
- I guess.

612
00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:07.904
But let's not let
it ruin our time. you know?

613
00:42:07.939 --> 00:42:11.977
I don't wanna stew. It's not
good for me.

614
00:42:12.012 --> 00:42:13.841
Of course. I wish things were
different

615
00:42:13.876 --> 00:42:15.878
and Ashley were with us.

616
00:42:17.396 --> 00:42:20.745
- She is. Ashley will always be
with us.

617
00:42:20.779 --> 00:42:24.058
[tense brooding music]

618
00:42:25.128 --> 00:42:27.337
- Hey. are you two
assholes like going to bed

619
00:42:27.372 --> 00:42:29.167
or are you gonna come have a
drink?

620
00:42:29.201 --> 00:42:32.929
- Yeah!
- Come on! [laughs]

621
00:42:35.863 --> 00:42:38.279
[birds chirp]

622
00:42:48.013 --> 00:42:50.706
- Oh. it's gonna be
perfect for sunbathing.

623
00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:53.950
- Oh. I'm fucking dying in
there. dude.

624
00:42:56.263 --> 00:42:59.231
How do people do that?
- Easy peasy.

625
00:42:59.266 --> 00:43:01.061
- No. That's not fun.

626
00:43:12.244 --> 00:43:15.247
[soft gentle music]

627
00:43:26.396 --> 00:43:30.262
[people chatter indistinctly]

628
00:43:33.369 --> 00:43:34.232
- I know.
- Nailed it.

629
00:43:34.266 --> 00:43:35.751
- I don't know. It's been a long
time.

630
00:43:35.785 --> 00:43:36.579
- You'll get used to it.
- You know?

631
00:43:36.614 --> 00:43:39.340
[speaks indistinctly] or
something.

632
00:43:39.375 --> 00:43:42.102
- Hand me one of those. will ya?

633
00:43:43.482 --> 00:43:45.139
Ooh. This is great.

634
00:43:47.832 --> 00:43:48.971
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

635
00:43:51.249 --> 00:43:53.700
- Oh. I needed this. [laughs]

636
00:43:53.734 --> 00:43:56.150
[wind blows]

637
00:43:58.187 --> 00:43:59.844
Hey. Alana.
- Yo.

638
00:43:59.878 --> 00:44:01.431
- Truth or dare?

639
00:44:01.466 --> 00:44:03.641
- Fuck. What are we. 12?

640
00:44:04.883 --> 00:44:05.884
Truth.

641
00:44:05.919 --> 00:44:09.060
- Have you seen Chris
since you've been back?

642
00:44:09.094 --> 00:44:12.753
- I mean. you mean like seen.
seen him?

643
00:44:12.788 --> 00:44:15.169
- Like with your eyes.
Have you talked to him?

644
00:44:15.204 --> 00:44:16.343
- I mean. he came sulking around
here

645
00:44:16.377 --> 00:44:18.448
when I first got back to my
mom's.

646
00:44:18.483 --> 00:44:21.866
- Really? Okay. and then what
happened?

647
00:44:23.522 --> 00:44:27.216
- I told him to get lost.
- Really?

648
00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:30.012
Truthfully now. Alana.
- Am I speaking Norwegian?

649
00:44:30.046 --> 00:44:32.808
I told him to never contact me
again.

650
00:44:32.842 --> 00:44:36.328
- Okay. I guess we
must've heard wrong then.

651
00:44:36.363 --> 00:44:38.952
[women laugh]

652
00:44:39.953 --> 00:44:42.852
All right. your turn.
- Okay. Miles.

653
00:44:42.887 --> 00:44:45.372
Truth or dare?
- Truth.

654
00:44:45.406 --> 00:44:48.409
- Okay. what's the
craziest thing you've done

655
00:44:48.444 --> 00:44:50.377
since starting college?

656
00:44:51.516 --> 00:44:54.899
- Craziest?
- Or. or big or unexpected?

657
00:44:58.523 --> 00:45:01.181
- I mean. I came out to my dad.

658
00:45:03.114 --> 00:45:05.461
- Really?
- No shit.

659
00:45:05.495 --> 00:45:09.361
How did it old Pastor Pat take
that one?

660
00:45:09.396 --> 00:45:12.433
- Pretty well. actually. He kind
of knew.

661
00:45:12.468 --> 00:45:17.473
- That's good. Congrats.
- [laughs] Yeah.

662
00:45:17.853 --> 00:45:20.269
All right. Sam. Truth or dare?

663
00:45:21.235 --> 00:45:22.098
- Dare.

664
00:45:24.445 --> 00:45:28.760
Oh shit. I don't really
have a dare. Let me think.

665
00:45:30.072 --> 00:45:33.247
I. I dare you to-

666
00:45:33.282 --> 00:45:36.285
- Fuck it. Truth then.
- Okay. good.

667
00:45:40.323 --> 00:45:42.394
In the case of an emergency.

668
00:45:42.429 --> 00:45:46.985
like let's say that escaped
ex murderer comes around.

669
00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:49.850
who here do you trust the least?

670
00:45:49.885 --> 00:45:51.024
- Barb.
- What?

671
00:45:51.058 --> 00:45:53.095
[Alana laughs]

672
00:45:53.129 --> 00:45:55.166
- [Samantha] I'm sorry.
I love you. but yeah.

673
00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:56.443
of everyone here. it's you.

674
00:45:56.477 --> 00:46:01.344
- [scoffs] All right. thank you
for that.

675
00:46:02.829 --> 00:46:06.867
- [laughs] Okay. well then. it's
my turn.

676
00:46:06.902 --> 00:46:08.904
and Barb. truth or dare?

677
00:46:13.978 --> 00:46:15.186
- Truth. truth.

678
00:46:18.016 --> 00:46:20.087
- After all of this time.

679
00:46:21.502 --> 00:46:24.609
how do you feel about what
happened?

680
00:46:24.643 --> 00:46:27.957
[soft ethereal music]

681
00:46:35.309 --> 00:46:40.314
- Honestly. I tried everything
to not think about it at all.

682
00:46:43.455 --> 00:46:44.905
- Can I ask why?

683
00:46:47.287 --> 00:46:50.255

00:59:39.437 --> 00:59:41.094
- It's cool.

856
00:59:41.129 --> 00:59:43.165
- And here I thought I was
invited to this cool cabin

857
00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:47.135
with a house full of
bunch of hot single girls.

858
00:59:49.827 --> 00:59:50.656
Yeah. I should've caught on
that.

859
00:59:50.690 --> 00:59:53.175
Maybe it was too good to be
true.

860
00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:55.868
- Yeah. you probably should've.

861
00:59:55.902 --> 00:59:56.765
- My bad.

862
00:59:58.871 --> 01:00:01.390
- Jesus. How long is she gonna
be?

863
01:00:01.425 --> 01:00:04.359

almost 20 minutes already.

864

tonight!

865
01:00:08.121 --> 01:00:12.332

- You guys wanna smoke weed?

866
01:00:13.402 --> 01:00:17.786
I'm sorry. I just meant
that I have a spliff.

867
01:00:17.821 --> 01:00:20.271
Do you guys wanna smoke?

868
01:00:20.306 --> 01:00:21.410
- No.

869
01:00:21.445 --> 01:00:26.381
We grew up and developed
real drug habits. so thanks.

870
01:00:26.415 --> 01:00:27.865
- Right. My bad.

871
01:00:29.833 --> 01:00:33.699
Yeah. sorry. I'm just
gonna go wait outside.

872
01:00:33.733 --> 01:00:36.460
Whenever they're done talking or
whatever.

873
01:00:36.494 --> 01:00:38.738

out there waiting for him.

01:01:42.043 --> 01:01:45.046
Hey. I'm sorry about crashing
your party.

888
01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:48.981
I really didn't know that-
- No. no. it's fine.

889
01:01:49.015 --> 01:01:52.398
I'm sorry for how we reacted
towards you.

890
01:01:52.432 --> 01:01:55.953
That really wasn't cool.
- It's all right.

891
01:01:57.161 --> 01:02:00.302
- So you. you don't have to wait
out here.

892
01:02:00.337 --> 01:02:02.201
Knowing those two. it's gonna be
awhile.

893
01:02:02.235 --> 01:02:05.100
- [laughs] Yeah.
- So you can come back in

894
01:02:05.135 --> 01:02:09.864
and have a drink if you want.
- All right. cool. Thanks.

895
01:02:11.382 --> 01:02:13.246
I'm. I'm gonna just finish this.

896
01:02:13.281 --> 01:02:15.904

Are you sure he didn't come back
in here?

916

917
01:04:39.323 --> 01:04:42.395

You don't think-

really weird going on all day.

- Right? Where the hell is
Mikki?

933
01:05:48.323 --> 01:05:50.601

- I'm calling her right now.

934

- Okay. Hey. don't trip. all
right?

935
01:05:53.604 --> 01:05:56.228
He's probably just out
taking a piss somewhere.

936
01:05:56.262 --> 01:05:57.401
I didn't mean to freak you out.

937
01:05:57.436 --> 01:05:58.575
- Okay. let's just be sure.

938
01:05:58.609 --> 01:05:59.990
Too many weird things have
happened today

939
01:06:00.025 --> 01:06:02.613
to just be a coincidence.
and. to be honest.

940
01:06:02.648 --> 01:06:06.410
I have had this kind of weird
gut feeling about it all day.

941
01:06:06.445 --> 01:06:10.138
- He's probably just down
by the car taking a piss.

942
01:06:10.173 --> 01:06:11.036
- She's still not answering.

943
01:06:11.070 --> 01:06:13.141
I'm. I'm gonna. just gonna call
my mom.

944
01:06:13.176 --> 01:06:15.454
- Guys. this is weird.
Let's get outta here.

945
01:06:15.488 --> 01:06:17.490
- Just wait. It's safer inside.

946
01:06:17.525 --> 01:06:18.664
- Hey. Mom.
- Okay.

947
01:06:18.698 --> 01:06:20.321
can someone please tell me
what the fuck is going on?

948
01:06:20.355 --> 01:06:22.702
- Okay. you heard that
emergency alert earlier?

949
01:06:22.737 --> 01:06:24.497
Well. Barb's mom called to tell
us

950
01:06:24.532 --> 01:06:26.327
that somebody fucking escaped
from prison.

951
01:06:26.361 --> 01:06:28.122
and then we get here.
and now Mikki is missing.

952
01:06:28.156 --> 01:06:30.572
- And she should've been
here before we were.

953
01:06:30.607 --> 01:06:34.369
- Okay. as always. you
are overreacting. Alana.

954
01:06:34.404 --> 01:06:37.303
You. you and your friends.
they always do this.

955
01:06:37.338 --> 01:06:38.580
- Okay. this is serious. Chris.

956
01:06:38.615 --> 01:06:40.306
No one's been able to get ahold
of her.

957
01:06:40.341 --> 01:06:42.653
- Yeah. but plus these cops came
by

958
01:06:42.688 --> 01:06:44.793
doing this weird welfare
check or something.

959
01:06:44.828 --> 01:06:46.209
- I'm trying to hear! Shh!

960
01:06:46.243 --> 01:06:47.072
- You know. we would still be a
thing

961
01:06:47.106 --> 01:06:48.452
if it weren't for shit like
this.

962
01:06:48.487 --> 01:06:49.453

- I'm just gonna-

963

- Sh!
- Wait. stop!

01:06:50.834 --> 01:06:52.008
- What. Mom?

965
01:06:53.285 --> 01:06:54.493
No. I. I was...

966
01:06:56.357 --> 01:06:58.807
No. I was saying. are you sure?

967
01:06:58.842 --> 01:07:00.292
[sighs] Okay. yeah.

968
01:07:00.326 --> 01:07:04.399
because she's just still
answering her phone. so.

969
01:07:05.297 --> 01:07:06.643
Okay. I love you.

970
01:07:08.231 --> 01:07:10.233
Bye.
- What did she say?

971
01:07:10.267 --> 01:07:14.306
- [sighs] She. [laughs] well.

972
01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:16.825
I feel like a fucking idiot now.

973
01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:21.554
That emergency service
announcement. it's a false
alarm.

974
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:23.246
- Really?
- Yeah.

975
01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:26.145
but she's gonna call Mikki's
parents

976
01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:30.770
and see if they've heard.
- Thank god. Jesus Christ. I-

977
01:07:30.805 --> 01:07:33.739
- Great. Now can I go
find my friend please?

978
01:07:33.773 --> 01:07:36.086

I mean. we were all thinking
the same thing. right?

I suppose it is a little stupid.
[sighs]

985

you.

- I mean. I don't really know
him. Why?

1000
01:09:22.951 --> 01:09:25.437
- He seemed like a nice guy.

1001
01:09:25.471 --> 01:09:29.406
I mean. I really questioned
his taste in friends. but-

1002

- Yeah. look. Sam. No.
- Seriously.

to be here this summer.
