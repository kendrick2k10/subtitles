[***]

8
00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:12.238
Is this
where you try to stab me?

9
00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:14.074
[laughs]

10
00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:15.575
Just help me up.

11
00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:18.661
Good job.

12
00:01:18.703 --> 00:01:19.788
Professor Lindo?

13
00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:21.956
Please continue. Miss Teagarden.

14
00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:23.083
Okay.

15
00:01:23.124 --> 00:01:24.876
So. the murderer told police

16
00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:26.252
that his victim. Barbara Evans.

17
00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:27.754
tried to stab him
with a pair of scissors

18
00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:29.422
while hiding under a desk.

19
00:01:29.464 --> 00:01:31.174
and his lawyers
claimed self-defense.

20
00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:32.759
but who can tell me

21
00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:33.677
why that doesn't match up

22
00:01:33.718 --> 00:01:34.844
with the facts

23
00:01:34.886 --> 00:01:36.471
the author presents
in this book?

24
00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:38.848
Yes!

25
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.183
Great job today.

26
00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:42.143
[student] Thank you so much.

27
00:01:44.688 --> 00:01:46.523
Well done. Miss Teagarden.

28
00:01:46.564 --> 00:01:47.732
You really had them
paying attention

29
00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:48.817
with that re-enactment.

30
00:01:48.858 --> 00:01:50.443
I certainly picked
the right person

31
00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:51.653
to be my teaching assistant.

32
00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:53.238
Well. thanks.

33
00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:54.489
I really try
to picture the scene

34
00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:56.449
when I read true crime.
you know.

35
00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:57.826
like trying to figure out
what really happened

36
00:01:57.867 --> 00:01:59.285
is kinda like therapy to me.

37
00:01:59.327 --> 00:02:00.412
Hmm.

38
00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:02.706
Yeah. that makes sense to me.

39
00:02:02.747 --> 00:02:04.290
You know. I am very curious

40
00:02:04.332 --> 00:02:07.210
to see what topic you settle on
for your master's thesis.

41
00:02:07.252 --> 00:02:09.796
You know. your deadline
to turn that in to me

42
00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:11.464
is next Friday.

43
00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:13.299
Well. after reading your book
on the Laci Peterson case.

44
00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:15.510
and all that stuff

45
00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:16.720
about how the prosecutor
would test out his theories

46
00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:17.887
on Internet message boards.

47
00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:19.723
I was thinking something like.

48
00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:21.766
"The impact of amateur sleuths
on the justice system."

49
00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:24.310
Hmm. that's a good start.

50
00:02:24.352 --> 00:02:26.271
I know. I need to do
more research.

51
00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:27.731
but I can't this week.

52
00:02:27.772 --> 00:02:29.607
not with starting that new job
at the diner.

53
00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:31.151
and trying to keep
my friend. Sally. sane

54
00:02:31.192 --> 00:02:32.193
before her wedding.

55
00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:35.363
Speaking of which.
I should get going.

56
00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:37.032
Uh. burgers or bride?

57
00:02:37.073 --> 00:02:38.658
Burgers.

58
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.868
Great.

59
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.708
[***]

60
00:02:50.045 --> 00:02:51.963
Do we have steamed broccoli?

61
00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:54.549
Uh. yeah.

62
00:02:56.051 --> 00:02:57.010
You must be the new server.

63
00:02:57.052 --> 00:02:58.219
I'm Daniel.

64
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.639
Oh!
Hey. um. I'm Roe.

65
00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:06.227
Um. is there some abbreviation
I should use?

66
00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.647
Officially. it's B-R-O-C.
but "BR" works. too.

67
00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:10.899
After 12 years here.

68
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.026
I've got abbreviations
for the abbreviations.

69
00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:15.195
12 years. Wow.

70
00:03:15.236 --> 00:03:16.905
Yeah. the owner is kinda like
a dad to me.

71
00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:18.031
and it's a pretty good gig.

72
00:03:18.073 --> 00:03:18.823
[dings order bell]

73
00:03:23.787 --> 00:03:24.996
[man] Roe Teagarden?

74
00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:26.498
Oh!

75
00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:29.793
Arthur!

76
00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:31.002
Hey!

77
00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:32.754
Here. let me help you out here.

78
00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:35.757
Um. this is for you.

79
00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:38.385
Enjoy.

80
00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:39.427
[Arthur] I knew you'd be
back in town

81
00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:40.637
for Sally's wedding.

82
00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:42.597
I just didn't expect
to run into you here.

83
00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:43.390
I thought you were living
in Seattle

84
00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:44.557
working on your Master's.

85
00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.351
Well. I was.
I did my first year there.

86
00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:47.686
but then I found out

87
00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:49.020
that the Library Science program
at Lawrenceton U

88
00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:51.773
offers a specialization
in true-crime literature.

89
00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:52.941
so here I am.

90
00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:54.651
working two jobs
for tuition money.

91
00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:56.444
Mondays and Wednesdays as a TA.

92
00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:57.821
and then another
three days a week here.

93
00:03:57.862 --> 00:03:58.905
True Crime. huh?

94
00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:00.699
Classic Roe.

95
00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.410
I remember you carrying around
true-crime books in high school.

96
00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:04.536
reading them between classes.

97
00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:06.996
Still my M.O..

98
00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:08.248
Just finished this one.

99
00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:11.251
Assigned reading
for the undergrads I teach.

100
00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:12.836
"Quest for Justice:
The Killing of Barbara Evans."

101
00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:14.212
Interesting.

102
00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:15.964
-Take it.
-Yeah?

103
00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:17.257
Yeah. I think you'd like it.

104
00:04:17.298 --> 00:04:18.633
and. obviously.

105
00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:20.343
you're in the crime-solving
business these days.

106
00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:23.722
The uniform
looks good on you. Arthur.

107
00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:24.889
Oh. thanks.

108
00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:26.391
I. uh...

109
00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:28.476
Yeah. if you're going to be
working here. um...

110
00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:31.271
you'll be seeing me in it a lot.

111
00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:32.689
Yeah. me and my compadres.

112
00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:35.191
we like to eat here
after our shift is over. so...

113
00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:36.776
[order bell dings]

114
00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:37.819
I've got food up.

115
00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:38.862
but will I see you

116
00:04:38.903 --> 00:04:40.405
at Sally's wedding
kick-off party?

117
00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:41.489
I'll be there.

118
00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:43.366
Okay.

119
00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:49.330
[whispering] "Compadres..."

120
00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:53.460
[***]

121
00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:08.725
[Aida] Aurora?

122
00:05:08.767 --> 00:05:11.311
Oh. thank goodness you're here.

123
00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:13.146
You know. we have to leave
for Sally's party

124
00:05:13.188 --> 00:05:14.064
in less than an hour.

125
00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:14.856
so you--

126
00:05:16.024 --> 00:05:17.067
Honey. um...

127
00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:18.068
please don't sit
on the couch

128
00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:20.695
with those soiled diner clothes.

129
00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:21.780
I can smell the grease
from here.

130
00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:23.365
Yes. Mother.

131
00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:24.908
You know. I barely had time
to stop at the gym

132
00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:26.493
after the office.

133
00:05:26.534 --> 00:05:28.453
and then. I had to bring home
insurance audits

134
00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:29.913
to work on after the party.

135
00:05:29.954 --> 00:05:31.247
You brought work home again?

136
00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:32.332
Mm-hmm.

137
00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:33.500
You know. I took this temp job

138
00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:35.293
because I wanted to keep
the lights on

139
00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:36.252
at the real-estate office.

140
00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:37.712
but at this point.

141
00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:40.006
I have sold more boat insurance
than I have houses.

142
00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:42.008
I'm sure
that'll turn around soon.

143
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.010
Maybe I should just...

144
00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:45.303
close the office
and admit defeat.

145
00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:46.805
Mother. no.

146
00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:48.807
You have worked years
to start your own agency.

147
00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:50.392
You can't just give up
on your dream.

148
00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:53.478
Yeah. well. I call it
being more realistic.

149
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.522
[doorbell rings]

150
00:05:57.607 --> 00:05:58.942
-Hey. Sally.
-Hi.

151
00:05:58.983 --> 00:06:00.151
I know we're early.

152
00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:01.152
but Matt has some things
he needs to do

153
00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:02.153
before the party. so...

154
00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:03.405
Hey. Aurora.

155
00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:04.447
Thanks for giving her
a ride today.

156
00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:05.615
[Roe] Of course.

157
00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:06.449
What else
is a Maid of Honor for?

158
00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:07.867
See you there?

159
00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:08.910
Hello. Aida!

160
00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:10.286
Oh. hello. Matt!

161
00:06:10.328 --> 00:06:11.496
-See you.
-Bye.

162
00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:13.289
[Sally]
I don't know why I thought

163
00:06:13.331 --> 00:06:14.457
throwing a party
three days before the wedding

164
00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:15.750
was a good idea.

165
00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:17.836
[Aida]
It was a great idea. Sally.

166
00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:18.878
[Sally] Oh. no.

167
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.714
I forgot to tell Matt

168
00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:22.632
that Aunt Gladys doesn't want
to be picked up till 7:30!

169
00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:24.801
It's okay. I'll go tell him.

170
00:06:25.927 --> 00:06:27.554
Matt?

171
00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:30.557
Matt!

[car engine starting]

174
00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.418
Sally. I'm sorry.

175
00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.627
I couldn't catch Matt.

176
00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:01.755
He was gone
by the time I got outside.

177
00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:04.132
Oh. not to worry.
I can go pick up Gladys.

178
00:07:04.174 --> 00:07:05.550
I mean. she and I haven't
seen each other for a while.

179
00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:06.760
so it'll be fun to catch up.

180
00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:08.178
Thank you. Aida.

181
00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:09.429
I'll send Matt a text.

182
00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:10.555
[Aida] Okay.

183
00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:12.182
So this is very eye-catching.

184
00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:13.892
I mean. really. Sally.

185
00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:16.895
your interior-design blog
is very impressive.

186
00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:18.021
Yeah. you know.
Matt could make one of these

187
00:07:18.063 --> 00:07:19.939
for your real-estate office.

188
00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:21.775
Yeah. maybe.

189
00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:22.609
You know. this isn't
how I thought I would use

190
00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:23.777
my journalism degree.

191
00:07:23.818 --> 00:07:25.570
but Matt's been so encouraging.

192
00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:26.946
and my email list
is growing. so...

193
00:07:26.988 --> 00:07:28.948
So you actually
finished your degree?

194
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.784
Well. not technically.

195
00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:33.536
I still have six credits to go.

196
00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:34.537
Did I tell you guys?

197
00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:36.206
Matt and Carson
got a huge offer

198
00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:37.040
to buy their company.

199
00:07:37.082 --> 00:07:38.291
Wow!

200
00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:40.251
For their web-platform thing?

201
00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:41.169
Megablog?

202
00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:42.462
It's Giggoblog.

203
00:07:42.504 --> 00:07:43.797
and. yeah.
it's a big money offer

204
00:07:43.838 --> 00:07:44.964
that's supposed to go through
next week.

205
00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:46.424
Oh. congratulations!

206
00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:47.676
Thank you.

207
00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:49.094
Now. um.

208
00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:51.221
I'd better go look for something
to wear to the party.

209
00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:52.263
You too.

210
00:07:53.431 --> 00:07:54.724
[sighs]

211
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:56.768
[chuckles]

212
00:07:59.354 --> 00:08:01.147
Wanna see my blog?

213
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:03.149
Over here.

214
00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:04.984
Just don't tell my mother
I'm sitting on the couch.

215
00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:05.985
Deal.

216
00:08:06.027 --> 00:08:07.487
I love her.

217
00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:08.655
and I am lucky to have
a rent-free place to live.

218
00:08:08.697 --> 00:08:09.739
but it is not so easy

219
00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:10.990
moving back in with your mom

220
00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:13.993
after being on your own
for eight years.

221
00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:15.078
She still treats me

222
00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.079
like I'm barely
out of high school.

223
00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:17.038
At my bridal shower.

224
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.248
she kept asking me

225
00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:20.000
why I was "rushing"
to the altar.

226
00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:22.002
but then again. a lot of people
have been asking me that.

227
00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:25.255
Well. I mean.
it did happen kinda fast.

228
00:08:25.296 --> 00:08:26.339
I mean. that concert
where you met

229
00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:27.549
was. like. what.
seven months ago?

230
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.259
Please tell me
my Maid of Honor

231
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.343
is not a doubter. too?

232
00:08:30.385 --> 00:08:32.178
No. no. not a doubter.

233
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.555
I am definitely Team Matt.

234
00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:35.056
I've never seen you this happy.

235
00:08:35.098 --> 00:08:36.975
I am so happy.

236
00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:39.769
and you moving home

237
00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:41.813
is the cherry on top.

238
00:08:41.855 --> 00:08:43.565
All right. show me
the wonders of your blog.

239
00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:47.902
I just have to ask you.

240
00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:49.237
is that
what you're going to wear?

241
00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:50.947
[groans]
Okay. I'm changing.

242
00:08:50.989 --> 00:08:52.032
She said it--

243
00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:53.533
Sally. Mother.
everyone in this house--

244
00:08:53.575 --> 00:08:54.826
I'm changing!

245
00:08:54.868 --> 00:09:00.957
* This heart has waited... *

246
00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:05.003
[Sally]
Well. what do you think. Roe?

247
00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:06.046
Wow. Sally.

248
00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:08.381
this place really is
quite the venue.

249
00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:09.799
When I was little.

250
00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:11.468
my Grammy and I
used to come here for tea

251
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:12.385
every month.

252
00:09:12.427 --> 00:09:13.553
Aw...

253
00:09:13.595 --> 00:09:15.263
I knew when I was nine

254
00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:17.557
this would be the perfect place
to have my wedding.

255
00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:18.767
[Roe] Well. it's beautiful.

256
00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:20.518
and you did
an incredible job decorating.

257
00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.936
I hope you took
lots of pictures for the blog.

258
00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:23.313
[Sally] Oh. yeah.
Matt already did.

259
00:09:23.355 --> 00:09:24.981
and he already
uploaded everything.

260
00:09:25.023 --> 00:09:26.399
I honestly think

261
00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:27.692
he could do anything
with the Internet.

262
00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:29.402
Yeah. you gotta watch out
for my brother.

263
00:09:29.444 --> 00:09:30.737
He once hacked into
the college website

264
00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:32.530
just to prove to the professor
that he could.

265
00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:33.865
[laughing]

266
00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:34.991
Hey. Kara. you want
to help me with these?

267
00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:35.950
Yeah. I'd love to.

268
00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:37.285
-Oops!
-Thanks.

269
00:09:37.327 --> 00:09:38.870
-I'll take some.
-Thank you.

270
00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:40.372
I wish there could be
a placecard for my mom.

271
00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:41.748
She just...

272
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.416
she would have loved to see
Matt get married.

273
00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:44.459
Oh!

274
00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:45.919
Your mom died?

275
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.545
-I'm so sorry. I had no idea.
-Oh. no. no. no...

276
00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:49.756
I mean. I know your dad passed
when you guys were young. but...

277
00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:52.300
Yeah. Matt was only 15
when she passed.

278
00:09:52.342 --> 00:09:54.928
but. Sally. I can't tell you
how much it means to me

279
00:09:54.969 --> 00:09:57.847
that we get to be part
of the beautiful Allison clan.

280
00:09:57.889 --> 00:09:59.099
and I just love you so much!

281
00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.100
Oh...

282
00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:01.267
-Hey!
-Roe!

283
00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:02.602
I gotta thank you
for lending me that book.

284
00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:04.187
the one on the Evans' murder.

285
00:10:04.229 --> 00:10:05.814
I'm two chapters in already.
It's great.

286
00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:07.399
Right?
I couldn't put it down.

287
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.317
Yeah. no. that lead detective
is quite a character.

288
00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:10.735
I think that's
what I want to do.

289
00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:12.320
make my way up to detective.

290
00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:13.530
I'm actually already assigned

291
00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:14.864
to our homicide detective's
detail.

292
00:10:14.906 --> 00:10:16.533
Arthur!
That's amazing!

293
00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:19.160
Oh. I can't wait
to hear your stories.

294
00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:20.203
[Arthur] Ladies!
Lovely to see you both.

295
00:10:20.245 --> 00:10:21.454
Hi.

296
00:10:21.496 --> 00:10:23.081
There you are. darling girl.

297
00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:24.207
You're home.

298
00:10:24.249 --> 00:10:25.166
[Arthur] Can I offer you
some champagne?

299
00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:26.793
-I'd love some.
-Yes.

300
00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:29.045
Oh. your mother must be
over the moon.

301
00:10:29.087 --> 00:10:29.921
Are you kidding?

302
00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:31.131
Her mother is thrilled.

303
00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:32.799
I missed her so much.

304
00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:34.134
[Roe] Yes. it's like
I never left.

305
00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:35.176
Oh...

306
00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:36.094
[laughing]

307
00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:38.096
Aurora! Hey.

308
00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:39.347
I want to introduce you
to someone.

309
00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:42.017
Maid of honor. the best man.

310
00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:43.685
Aurora Teagarden.
Carson Hayford.

311
00:10:43.727 --> 00:10:44.978
Nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

312
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.396
You as well.

313
00:10:46.438 --> 00:10:47.439
I'm glad we're finally getting
this show on the road.

314
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.815
Mm-hmm!

315
00:10:48.857 --> 00:10:49.816
Oh. yeah. nothing's
going to keep these two

316
00:10:49.858 --> 00:10:50.942
from getting together.
[chuckles]

317
00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:52.986
Mind if I steal Matt
for a second?

318
00:10:53.028 --> 00:10:54.696
Duty calls.

319
00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:00.201
Hi!

320
00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:06.291
[Arthur]
Well. it's great to see you.

321
00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:07.459
it really is.

322
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.877
So I keep hearing

323
00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:10.337
that Matt and Carson
are about to be millionaires?

324
00:11:10.378 --> 00:11:11.755
Mm-hmm.

325
00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:14.716
Sally's found love
and also enviable security.

326
00:11:14.758 --> 00:11:16.259
And so quickly.

327
00:11:16.301 --> 00:11:17.719
Well. maybe you can find them
an enviable home to buy.

328
00:11:17.761 --> 00:11:18.762
and quickly.

329
00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:19.971
And quickly.

330
00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:21.681
[man shouting]
Where's Matt Walker?

331
00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:24.434
Walker. you owe me.

332
00:11:24.476 --> 00:11:25.852
and I'm gonna make sure you pay!

333
00:11:25.894 --> 00:11:27.437
[Matt] Take it easy.
Take it easy.

334
00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:29.022
Hey. can we do something
about that?

335
00:11:29.064 --> 00:11:30.357
-[Matt] Get off me!
-Hey. what's going on?

336
00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:31.691
[man] I'm going!

337
00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:32.692
[Matt] Nothing's happening.
it's all right.

338
00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:33.860
I'm coming after you.

339
00:11:41.993 --> 00:11:43.411
-Who was that?
-I don't know.

340
00:11:43.453 --> 00:11:45.372
I've never seen him before.

341
00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:46.623
[Roe] What?

342
00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:48.083
That doesn't make sense

343
00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:49.959
for a stranger
to confront you like that?

344
00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:51.628
Yeah. and what did he mean
he's coming after you?

345
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.047
I have no idea.

346
00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:56.299
Honestly. that was
the weirdest thing

347
00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:57.342
that's ever happened to me.

348
00:11:57.384 --> 00:11:58.885
aside from that stray dog

349
00:11:58.927 --> 00:12:00.595
jumping in my car that one time?

350
00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:01.888
He was trying
to come home with me.

351
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:02.931
It was probably his owner.
[giggling]

352
00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:04.265
Yes. it probably was.

353
00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:13.525
Everyone's staring.

354
00:12:15.777 --> 00:12:17.737
Everyone. attention?

355
00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:18.905
If you haven't found
a glass of champagne.

356
00:12:18.947 --> 00:12:20.448
it's time to pick one up.

357
00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:24.911
Thank you.

358
00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:28.206
[Roe] To Sally.

359
00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:30.583
my best friend
and my chosen sister.

360
00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:33.044
I remember in freshman English

361
00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:34.921
when all the stories you wrote

362
00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:36.589
always had some kind of
love story in them.

363
00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:38.591
[everyone chuckling]

364
00:12:38.633 --> 00:12:39.926
So it's pretty surreal

365
00:12:39.968 --> 00:12:42.178
to see you live out
your own love story now

366
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.347
with someone
who not only gets you.

367
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:45.306
but also supports your work.

368
00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:48.935
You okay?

369
00:12:48.977 --> 00:12:50.186
Yeah.
Yeah. I'm great.

370
00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:56.901
To the bride and groom.

371
00:12:56.943 --> 00:12:58.695
and their happily ever after!

372
00:12:58.737 --> 00:13:00.447
[everyone repeating]
To the bride and groom!

373
00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:02.449
[glasses clinking]

374
00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:13.209
[chuckling]

375
00:13:13.251 --> 00:13:14.753
And I expect
a phone call from you

376
00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:16.880
if you plan on
staying out late. okay?

377
00:13:16.921 --> 00:13:20.091
Mother. how about we pretend
I'm actually an adult now?

378
00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:21.426
Or how about we pretend

379
00:13:21.468 --> 00:13:23.636
that you actually like
my fussing over you

380
00:13:23.678 --> 00:13:25.305
because you know
how much I've missed it.

381
00:13:25.347 --> 00:13:27.557
Yes. I love you.

382
00:13:27.599 --> 00:13:29.225
I love you. too.

383
00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:30.518
Have fun.
Don't stay out too late.

384
00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.644
Yeah. yeah.

385
00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:33.355
I love you. Mother.

386
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.359
Are you kidding?

387
00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.485
Hey!

388
00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:39.819
Who is that woman?

389
00:13:39.861 --> 00:13:42.238
I saw her
outside my house earlier.

390
00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:45.617
That is Matt's ex-girlfriend.

391
00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:48.495
Dawn Palmer.

392
00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:49.537
She's gone stalker on him.

393
00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:50.663
Crashed his bachelor party.

394
00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:52.374
and I had to run interference.

395
00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:53.375
Does Sally know about her?

396
00:13:53.416 --> 00:13:54.668
I don't know.

397
00:13:54.709 --> 00:13:57.170
Dawn's a pain.
but basically harmless.

398
00:13:57.212 --> 00:13:59.005
Matt thinks once he's married.
she'll knock it off.

399
00:13:59.047 --> 00:14:00.423
Stalking is a crime.

400
00:14:00.465 --> 00:14:02.133
Why doesn't he just report her
to the police?

401
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:05.512
Not my circus. not my monkeys.

402
00:14:14.104 --> 00:14:15.980
I thought you were going
to drive me home.

403
00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:18.358
I know. I just. I had
a little too much to drink.

404
00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.984
so I...

405
00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:21.736
I'm gonna take a cab.
sleep it off.

406
00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:24.364
I'll call you in the morning?

407
00:14:24.406 --> 00:14:25.573
I'm sorry.

408
00:14:28.118 --> 00:14:28.993
Okay.

409
00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:30.495
Good night. Matt.

410
00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:34.374
Hey. how you doing?

411
00:14:34.416 --> 00:14:36.209
Matt hasn't been himself
all evening.

412
00:14:36.251 --> 00:14:38.545
[laughs]
Oh. don't worry about it.

413
00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:40.463
He always gets a little nervous
before big events.

414
00:14:40.505 --> 00:14:41.715
and getting married

415
00:14:41.756 --> 00:14:43.008
is about as big an event
as it gets. so...

416
00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:44.050
it's gonna be fine.

417
00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:45.593
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

418
00:14:45.635 --> 00:14:46.761
[woman] Miss Allison.
do you have a minute. please?

419
00:14:46.803 --> 00:14:47.971
Oh. I...

420
00:14:48.013 --> 00:14:49.597
Yeah. no. you go do you.

421
00:14:50.682 --> 00:14:52.100
Hey...

422
00:14:52.142 --> 00:14:54.644
were you just saying that
to make her feel better.

423
00:14:54.686 --> 00:14:55.812
or do you actually think

424
00:14:55.854 --> 00:14:57.188
there's nothing
to be worried about?

425
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:58.732
Maybe a little of both.

426
00:14:58.773 --> 00:14:59.733
I'm gonna take off.

427
00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:01.067
Hey. Sally!

428
00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:02.110
I'll see you
at the dress fitting.

429
00:15:02.152 --> 00:15:03.403
-[Sally] Bye. Kara.
-Love you.

430
00:15:03.445 --> 00:15:04.195
Bye.
Have a good one.

431
00:15:09.451 --> 00:15:12.078
Hi. friend.

432
00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.455
Do you remember
when you'd get super stressed

433
00:15:13.496 --> 00:15:14.706
before finals.

434
00:15:14.748 --> 00:15:15.749
so we'd have a sleepover.

435
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.000
and you'd come over.

436
00:15:17.042 --> 00:15:19.044
and we'd study.
and then watch a movie?

437
00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:20.837
Want to spend the night?

438
00:15:20.879 --> 00:15:23.757
There's a new true-crime doc
I'm dying to see.

439
00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:24.758
True crime?

440
00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:27.093
Thank you. but no thank you.

441
00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:29.637
Anyways. I'm tired.

442
00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:30.638
I'll just see you
tomorrow. okay?

443
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.140
I'll pick you up at the diner?

444
00:15:32.182 --> 00:15:33.099
Yeah.

445
00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:34.392
Dress fitting tomorrow.

446
00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:35.894
You got it.

447
00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:37.437
'Night. Sally.

448
00:15:37.479 --> 00:15:38.480
Good night.

449
00:15:41.816 --> 00:15:43.985
[***]

450
00:15:51.826 --> 00:15:53.161
What are you doing here?

451
00:15:53.203 --> 00:15:54.245
Oh. hey.

452
00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:55.455
I'm just meeting
a couple of friends.

453
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.124
Is that a frittata?

454
00:15:58.166 --> 00:15:59.209
I didn't know we had that
on the menu.

455
00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:00.543
We don't.

456
00:16:00.585 --> 00:16:02.545
I just made it for me to eat
before we clock in.

457
00:16:02.587 --> 00:16:04.464
Want a taste?

458
00:16:04.506 --> 00:16:05.382
Sure.

459
00:16:09.844 --> 00:16:11.054
Wow.

460
00:16:11.096 --> 00:16:12.097
That is delicious.

461
00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:13.431
It should be.

462
00:16:13.473 --> 00:16:14.683
You're looking at
a culinary-school graduate.

463
00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:17.143
You're a chef?

464
00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:18.812
Then why are you...?

465
00:16:18.853 --> 00:16:21.189
Working in a diner?

466
00:16:21.231 --> 00:16:24.192
Emilio is the one
who paid for my training. so...

467
00:16:24.234 --> 00:16:26.486
how ungrateful would I be
to go work somewhere else?

468
00:16:28.822 --> 00:16:30.532
Okay. so my friend
is getting married on Saturday.

469
00:16:30.573 --> 00:16:32.033
and I promised

470
00:16:32.075 --> 00:16:33.993
I would make her and the other
bridesmaid breakfast.

471
00:16:34.035 --> 00:16:35.370
but maybe
I could bring them here

472
00:16:35.412 --> 00:16:37.664
and you could make
some of that instead?

473
00:16:37.706 --> 00:16:38.998
Yeah!

474
00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.417
Yeah. I'd love to cook
for your friends.

475
00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:41.209
Oh. thank you.

476
00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:42.836
You just made my day.

477
00:16:42.877 --> 00:16:44.295
-Arthur! Hi.
-Hey.

478
00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:45.839
Kinda early
for you to be in here.

479
00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.049
Ah. just grabbing
a quick coffee to go.

480
00:16:48.091 --> 00:16:50.218
Hey. uh. did you--

481
00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.387
did you think that party
was a bit weird last night?

482
00:16:52.429 --> 00:16:54.264
You mean
with the party crashers.

483
00:16:54.305 --> 00:16:55.682
stalkers.

484
00:16:55.724 --> 00:16:57.642
and the groom ditching the bride
at the end of the night?

485
00:16:57.684 --> 00:16:58.852
No. not weird at all.

486
00:16:58.893 --> 00:17:00.812
Wait. stalkers?
What stalkers?

487
00:17:00.854 --> 00:17:03.940
Dawn Palmer. Matt's ex.

488
00:17:03.982 --> 00:17:06.192
According to Carson.
she's basically harmless.

489
00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:07.610
Oh.

490
00:17:07.652 --> 00:17:09.904
Hey! What happened?

491
00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:11.156
Matt was supposed
to call me this morning.

492
00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:12.198
and he didn't.

493
00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.241
He's not answering the phone.

494
00:17:13.283 --> 00:17:14.284
and when I went to his condo.

495
00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:16.077
he didn't answer when I knocked.

496
00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:18.955
and I don't know
the door combination this month.

497
00:17:18.997 --> 00:17:20.206
It changes every month.

498
00:17:20.248 --> 00:17:22.208
And he's not replying
to my texts either.

499
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.085
[Sally] I'm so worried.

500
00:17:24.127 --> 00:17:26.087
Do you think I should file
a missing person's report?

501
00:17:26.129 --> 00:17:27.797
Can't do that until
he's been missing 24 hours.

502
00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:29.090
but try not to worry too much.

503
00:17:29.132 --> 00:17:30.550
Every year.

504
00:17:30.592 --> 00:17:32.218
the department gets one or two
missing groom cases.

505
00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.096
They always turn up. Sal.

506
00:17:35.138 --> 00:17:37.349
Yeah. I'm sure Matt's
just off working on his vows.

507
00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:39.100
Let's go
to your dress fitting. and--

508
00:17:39.142 --> 00:17:40.393
I think Kara
should just go with me.

509
00:17:40.435 --> 00:17:42.771
I want you to try to find Matt.

510
00:17:42.812 --> 00:17:44.064
Do you remember

511
00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:45.565
when you found my lost cat
in 10th grade?

512
00:17:45.607 --> 00:17:48.193
Or the time that you found
my finals paper

513
00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:49.694
for U.S. History?

514
00:17:49.736 --> 00:17:51.780
You're really good at
finding things. Roe.

515
00:17:51.821 --> 00:17:54.532
You always have been.

516
00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:56.242
Okay. I'll try.

517
00:17:56.284 --> 00:17:57.619
[Arthur] I can help.

518
00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.454
I don't start my shift
for another hour. so...

519
00:17:59.496 --> 00:18:01.164
[Kara] Thank you. both of you.

520
00:18:01.206 --> 00:18:02.832
Thank you so much.

521
00:18:02.874 --> 00:18:06.503
Sally. let's go get you
into your beautiful dress.

522
00:18:06.544 --> 00:18:07.420
Thank you.

523
00:18:07.462 --> 00:18:08.713
[Kara] It's going to be okay.

524
00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.050
Not sure
where to start. though.

525
00:18:12.092 --> 00:18:14.344
We should go to Matt's.
see if we can get in.

526
00:18:14.386 --> 00:18:16.262
How are we going to get in
if Sally can't get in?

527
00:18:17.889 --> 00:18:19.140
I don't know.

528
00:18:19.182 --> 00:18:21.726
but it's worth
taking a look. right?

529
00:18:24.479 --> 00:18:26.481
[Roe] So. Sally already
knocked and called.

530
00:18:26.523 --> 00:18:28.108
[Arthur] How do we even know
if he's home or not?

531
00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:29.567
[Roe] We don't.
we're winging it.

532
00:18:29.609 --> 00:18:30.860
Now come on.

533
00:18:33.822 --> 00:18:35.615
So. Matt's got this
combination lock on his door.

534
00:18:35.657 --> 00:18:36.950
Sally says

535
00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:38.284
he has a bunch of expensive
computer equipment.

536
00:18:38.326 --> 00:18:39.619
and keys can be copied.

537
00:18:39.661 --> 00:18:41.037
so this is more secure.

538
00:18:41.079 --> 00:18:43.039
but Sally doesn't even
have the code.

539
00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:44.249
What's he gonna do
after they're married?

540
00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:45.750
Still make her knock?

541
00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:47.752
We have to get in there.

542
00:18:47.794 --> 00:18:48.837
Roe. with or without the code.

543
00:18:48.878 --> 00:18:50.213
it's breaking and entering.

544
00:18:50.255 --> 00:18:52.173
Let me call in
a wellness check.

545
00:18:52.215 --> 00:18:53.758
get permission
to call a locksmith--

546
00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.302
Arthur. what if Matt's in there
and needs medical attention?

547
00:18:56.344 --> 00:18:58.138
Come on! Kick it in.

548
00:18:58.179 --> 00:18:59.222
Breaking and entering
is a crime.

549
00:18:59.264 --> 00:19:00.932
I could get suspended.

550
00:19:02.934 --> 00:19:04.310
Okay. fine. turn around.

551
00:19:04.352 --> 00:19:05.353
-You mean--
-Arthur. just--

552
00:19:07.105 --> 00:19:09.482
Turn around. okay?

553
00:19:09.524 --> 00:19:10.775
-I think that this is--
-Shh. shh. shh!

554
00:19:10.817 --> 00:19:11.860
Okay?

555
00:19:11.901 --> 00:19:13.528
No breaking. just entering.

556
00:19:27.292 --> 00:19:30.670
[***]

557
00:19:38.303 --> 00:19:41.723
[***]

558
00:19:51.441 --> 00:19:52.359
Oh. my--

559
00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.693
[glass breaking inside]

560
00:19:53.735 --> 00:19:54.611
Roe!
[banging on door]

561
00:19:54.652 --> 00:19:55.570
Roe!

562
00:20:00.408 --> 00:20:01.493
Okay. a little breaking.

563
00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:02.410
[exhaling]

564
00:20:02.452 --> 00:20:03.578
Come in.

565
00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.413
Don't be worried about it.
come on!

566
00:20:05.455 --> 00:20:06.456
Yeah.

567
00:20:10.085 --> 00:20:12.629
[Roe] There are no signs of Matt
in the bedrooms or bathrooms.

568
00:20:19.177 --> 00:20:21.137
Wow. look at this set-up.

569
00:20:21.179 --> 00:20:23.682
Must take a lot
to run a web platform.

570
00:20:23.723 --> 00:20:25.141
Matt left his phone.

571
00:20:25.183 --> 00:20:26.393
No phone. no car?

572
00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:27.394
That can't be good.

573
00:20:27.435 --> 00:20:28.478
Maybe there's a text

574
00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.105
and it'll tell us
where he is.

575
00:20:30.146 --> 00:20:31.564
What is that?

576
00:20:31.606 --> 00:20:32.941
Ceramic?

577
00:20:32.982 --> 00:20:34.275
A piece of a mug?

578
00:20:37.696 --> 00:20:39.280
Arthur. look.

579
00:20:39.322 --> 00:20:40.615
Looks like blood.

580
00:20:42.617 --> 00:20:43.993
[Arthur]
It definitely could be...

581
00:20:44.035 --> 00:20:45.328
There...

582
00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:47.497
more drops...

583
00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.004
...leading to the balcony.

584
00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.635
[Roe]
I didn't notice this before.

585
00:21:37.005 --> 00:21:39.382
We found him.

586
00:21:39.424 --> 00:21:40.925
We found Matt.

587
00:21:46.598 --> 00:21:47.432
[***]

588
00:21:53.271 --> 00:21:54.856
If Matt had too much to drink.

589
00:21:54.898 --> 00:21:58.401
maybe he got dizzy.
fell off the balcony?

590
00:21:58.443 --> 00:22:00.236
Not if those drops
on the floor of his condo

591
00:22:00.278 --> 00:22:02.072
were blood.

592
00:22:02.113 --> 00:22:03.198
Okay. let's turn him over.

593
00:22:06.951 --> 00:22:08.745
It's not Matt.

594
00:22:08.787 --> 00:22:10.288
[Arthur] Not Matt.
but he looks familiar.

595
00:22:11.998 --> 00:22:13.583
That's the guy
that confronted Matt last night

596
00:22:13.625 --> 00:22:14.584
at the party.

597
00:22:14.626 --> 00:22:15.835
Did you get a name?

598
00:22:15.877 --> 00:22:17.337
No. Matt said
he had no idea who he was.

599
00:22:18.546 --> 00:22:20.840
Let's hope Mr. Mysterious
has some ID on him.

600
00:22:20.882 --> 00:22:22.926
Smith. why don't you take
Miss Teagarden

601
00:22:22.967 --> 00:22:23.968
off my crime scene?

602
00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:25.011
Yes. Detective Cook.

603
00:22:25.053 --> 00:22:26.304
Let's go. Roe.

604
00:22:41.569 --> 00:22:42.946
Hey. It's not Matt.

605
00:22:42.987 --> 00:22:45.365
[Sally] Oh. thank god!

606
00:22:45.407 --> 00:22:47.409
Wait. so there was a body
under Matt's balcony.

607
00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:48.410
but it wasn't Matt?

608
00:22:48.451 --> 00:22:50.453
No.

609
00:22:50.495 --> 00:22:51.955
Then who was it?

610
00:22:51.996 --> 00:22:53.123
It was the guy who crashed
your party last night.

611
00:22:53.164 --> 00:22:55.083
the one who was yelling at Matt.

612
00:22:55.125 --> 00:22:56.126
You know who he is?

613
00:22:56.167 --> 00:22:57.252
No.

614
00:22:57.293 --> 00:23:00.255
Wait. so do we know
where Matt is?

615
00:23:04.092 --> 00:23:07.262
Um. sorry. I'll be right back.

616
00:23:12.142 --> 00:23:14.853
Hey. you're Dawn?

617
00:23:14.894 --> 00:23:16.813
You're Dawn Palmer. right?

618
00:23:16.855 --> 00:23:18.398
You've been following Matt.

619
00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.357
Did you follow him home
from the party last night?

620
00:23:19.399 --> 00:23:20.567
Yes.

621
00:23:20.608 --> 00:23:21.943
I knew he'd want to see me.

622
00:23:21.985 --> 00:23:24.029
and I was right.

623
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:26.239
He said that he was glad
to finally talk to me.

624
00:23:26.281 --> 00:23:28.199
Well. did he mention
anything else?

625
00:23:28.241 --> 00:23:30.160
Did he say he had plans
to go somewhere. or--?

626
00:23:30.201 --> 00:23:32.912
My conversations with Matt
are none of your business.

627
00:23:32.954 --> 00:23:33.872
Dawn. look. I just need
a couple of answer--

628
00:23:33.913 --> 00:23:35.498
Dawn!

629
00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.500
Dawn. the police are going
to want to talk to you!

630
00:23:37.542 --> 00:23:39.753
Dawn!

631
00:23:39.794 --> 00:23:41.379
[groans]

632
00:23:44.924 --> 00:23:46.593
Do you have any updates?

633
00:23:46.634 --> 00:23:48.011
So that was Dawn Palmer.

634
00:23:48.053 --> 00:23:49.512
Matt's stalker?

635
00:23:49.554 --> 00:23:50.889
She said she spoke to Matt
last night.

636
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:51.723
That was Dawn?

637
00:23:52.932 --> 00:23:53.892
So he spoke to her last night?

638
00:23:53.933 --> 00:23:55.185
What did he say?

639
00:23:55.226 --> 00:23:56.811
She wouldn't tell me.

640
00:23:56.853 --> 00:23:57.854
She doesn't like
to stick around.

641
00:23:57.896 --> 00:23:58.897
[Arthur] We'll track her down.

642
00:23:58.938 --> 00:24:00.190
but right now.

643
00:24:00.231 --> 00:24:01.066
we have a name
to go with the body.

644
00:24:01.107 --> 00:24:02.484
His driver's license says

645
00:24:02.525 --> 00:24:05.195
he's Brody Kresser
from Walnut Creek. California.

646
00:24:05.236 --> 00:24:06.196
That name ring a bell
with any of you?

647
00:24:06.237 --> 00:24:07.364
No.

648
00:24:07.405 --> 00:24:10.325
And Matt claimed
not to know him?

649
00:24:10.367 --> 00:24:12.786
What do you mean claimed?

650
00:24:12.827 --> 00:24:14.204
If Matt said
that he didn't know him.

651
00:24:14.245 --> 00:24:16.122
then he didn't know him. okay?

652
00:24:21.002 --> 00:24:22.837
Maybe you should give her
a ride home.

653
00:24:22.879 --> 00:24:23.922
let her catch her breath.

654
00:24:23.963 --> 00:24:25.465
Well. could you?

655
00:24:25.507 --> 00:24:26.341
Yeah. no. I--

656
00:24:26.383 --> 00:24:27.425
Yeah. Kara can take her home.

657
00:24:27.467 --> 00:24:28.718
I mean. I'd like to
stick around

658
00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:29.844
and see what else you find--

659
00:24:29.886 --> 00:24:31.471
Kara needs to answer
a few questions

660
00:24:31.513 --> 00:24:33.682
from Detective Cook
regarding her brother.

661
00:24:33.723 --> 00:24:34.849
Basic background information.

662
00:24:34.891 --> 00:24:36.351
-Okay?
-Okay.

663
00:24:39.896 --> 00:24:41.314
[sighs]

664
00:24:41.356 --> 00:24:44.943
Well. I can tell you this...

665
00:24:44.984 --> 00:24:47.153
The medical examiner
just found a huge gash

666
00:24:47.195 --> 00:24:49.489
on the side
of Brody Kresser's head...

667
00:24:49.531 --> 00:24:50.907
Well. if he fell off
that balcony--

668
00:24:50.949 --> 00:24:53.576
...with a shard
of ceramic in it.

669
00:24:53.618 --> 00:24:55.620
Ceramic like the one
we found inside Matt's condo?

670
00:24:55.662 --> 00:24:57.288
Yeah.

671
00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:59.916
It's not looking like
an accidental fall.

672
00:24:59.958 --> 00:25:01.793
It's looking like a homicide.

673
00:25:01.835 --> 00:25:04.254
So the blood
inside the condo...

674
00:25:04.295 --> 00:25:06.089
Matt could be the one
who killed him.

675
00:25:06.131 --> 00:25:08.049
It would explain
why he's missing.

676
00:25:08.091 --> 00:25:09.342
He's on the run.

677
00:25:09.384 --> 00:25:10.927
[exhales]

678
00:25:10.969 --> 00:25:12.303
Someone has to break it
to Sally.

679
00:25:12.345 --> 00:25:14.097
and I think it'd be better
coming from you

680
00:25:14.139 --> 00:25:16.224
than Detective Cook.

681
00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:21.688
[exhales] Yeah. all right.

682
00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:22.522
Wish me luck.

683
00:25:24.357 --> 00:25:25.483
Oh...

684
00:25:30.321 --> 00:25:31.865
[Roe] Sally. you're not
listening to me.

685
00:25:31.906 --> 00:25:33.199
This is serious.

686
00:25:33.241 --> 00:25:34.200
It's something
you need to be prepared for.

687
00:25:34.242 --> 00:25:35.535
Right. but I think

688
00:25:35.577 --> 00:25:37.037
that you might be
overreacting a little bit.

689
00:25:37.078 --> 00:25:38.121
-Aida?
-What?

690
00:25:38.163 --> 00:25:39.414
Will you please tell Roe

691
00:25:39.456 --> 00:25:42.542
that studying true crime
is warping her mind?

692
00:25:42.584 --> 00:25:44.127
She thinks
that we can't find Matt

693
00:25:44.169 --> 00:25:45.920
because he's involved
in killing someone.

694
00:25:45.962 --> 00:25:47.297
It's a possibility.

695
00:25:47.339 --> 00:25:49.007
one of many
the police are considering.

696
00:25:49.049 --> 00:25:50.091
But it's absurd.

697
00:25:50.133 --> 00:25:52.135
Roe. my Matt?

698
00:25:52.177 --> 00:25:55.180
He volunteers
at an animal shelter.

699
00:25:56.639 --> 00:25:59.267
It is crazy to think
that he could kill someone.

700
00:26:03.188 --> 00:26:05.523
I have to go call my parents.

701
00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:10.820
What in the world is going on?

702
00:26:10.862 --> 00:26:12.447
It's been a long day.

703
00:26:12.489 --> 00:26:14.407
Let's make some tea.
and I'll fill you in.

704
00:26:14.449 --> 00:26:15.909
Please.

705
00:26:24.459 --> 00:26:25.710
Carson.

706
00:26:25.752 --> 00:26:28.004
Just the person
we've been wanting to talk to.

707
00:26:28.046 --> 00:26:30.173
Hey. what-what's going on?

708
00:26:30.215 --> 00:26:31.383
You know
Matt's missing. right?

709
00:26:31.424 --> 00:26:32.592
What?

710
00:26:32.634 --> 00:26:34.803
Well. I know he didn't show up
at the shop

711
00:26:34.844 --> 00:26:36.179
to pick up the tuxedos
that he was supposed to

712
00:26:36.221 --> 00:26:37.347
this morning.

713
00:26:37.389 --> 00:26:39.683
No. You're telling me
he's missing?

714
00:26:39.724 --> 00:26:41.226
Neither Sally nor his sister
have heard from him

715
00:26:41.267 --> 00:26:42.018
since last night.

716
00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:43.436
Oh.

717
00:26:43.478 --> 00:26:44.813
Do you have any idea
where he is?

718
00:26:44.854 --> 00:26:46.022
Wh-- No.

719
00:26:46.064 --> 00:26:47.357
No...

720
00:26:48.733 --> 00:26:50.610
Is that why all the patrol cars
are out front?

721
00:26:50.652 --> 00:26:51.736
No. those are here

722
00:26:51.778 --> 00:26:53.697
because we found a body
on the premises.

723
00:26:53.738 --> 00:26:55.407
A body?

724
00:26:55.448 --> 00:26:56.616
Oh...

725
00:26:56.658 --> 00:26:57.826
but it's not Matt.

726
00:26:57.867 --> 00:26:58.702
It's the guy he had
that altercation with

727
00:26:58.743 --> 00:26:59.828
last night.

728
00:26:59.869 --> 00:27:01.329
A guy named Brody Kresser.

729
00:27:01.371 --> 00:27:02.747
Did you know him?

730
00:27:02.789 --> 00:27:03.832
No.

731
00:27:03.873 --> 00:27:05.417
No. I'm sure that was...

732
00:27:05.458 --> 00:27:06.543
I've never seen him
before last night.

733
00:27:06.584 --> 00:27:07.836
No. that's crazy.
That's awful.

734
00:27:07.877 --> 00:27:10.588
So if the body isn't Matt.

735
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:13.216
um. why are you guys
searching his place?

736
00:27:13.258 --> 00:27:14.259
Shouldn't you be out
looking for him?

737
00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:15.677
Well. we're hoping
to find something

738
00:27:15.719 --> 00:27:17.971
that might tell us where
he's disappeared to. for one.

739
00:27:18.013 --> 00:27:19.472
Right.

740
00:27:19.514 --> 00:27:21.641
You really
have no ideas on that?

741
00:27:22.892 --> 00:27:24.394
No.
No. zero ideas.

742
00:27:24.436 --> 00:27:26.396
I wish I could help. you know.

743
00:27:26.438 --> 00:27:28.982
Um. you know.
the computers in there.

744
00:27:29.024 --> 00:27:29.941
they don't belong to Matt.

745
00:27:29.983 --> 00:27:31.860
they belong to our company.

746
00:27:31.901 --> 00:27:33.153
If it's okay with you.

747
00:27:33.194 --> 00:27:35.321
I'd like to pack them up
and take them with me.

748
00:27:35.363 --> 00:27:36.781
Yeah. that's--
that's not going to happen.

749
00:27:36.823 --> 00:27:38.700
Right. I understand.

750
00:27:38.742 --> 00:27:42.037
but if you are thinking
of taking them.

751
00:27:42.078 --> 00:27:43.538
I expect to see a warrant

752
00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:46.082
specific to Giggoblog property.
of course.

753
00:27:46.124 --> 00:27:46.958
Well. I don't think
Detective Cook

754
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.209
was considering that before.

755
00:27:48.251 --> 00:27:50.587
but. uh.
I'm guessing he will now.

756
00:27:50.628 --> 00:27:52.088
Right...

757
00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:53.381
Right.

758
00:27:55.008 --> 00:27:57.927
Well. um. I'll leave you be.

759
00:27:57.969 --> 00:27:59.137
and keep me posted.

760
00:27:59.179 --> 00:28:01.014
You bet.

761
00:28:01.056 --> 00:28:03.391
See you.

762
00:28:14.152 --> 00:28:15.987
Hmm...

763
00:28:16.029 --> 00:28:18.573
So it appears Brody Kresser's
only address his entire life

764
00:28:18.615 --> 00:28:21.826
was his parents' house
in Walnut Creek. California.

765
00:28:21.868 --> 00:28:24.245
Although it's probably
his house now.

766
00:28:24.287 --> 00:28:25.955
There's an obituary here
for his mother. Alice.

767
00:28:25.997 --> 00:28:26.956
from three years ago.

768
00:28:26.998 --> 00:28:28.875
She died just one month

769
00:28:28.917 --> 00:28:30.585
after her husband was killed
in a car accident.

770
00:28:30.627 --> 00:28:31.795
Oh. my gosh.

771
00:28:31.836 --> 00:28:33.296
how tragic to lose
both of your parents

772
00:28:33.338 --> 00:28:34.964
so close together.

773
00:28:35.006 --> 00:28:37.133
Aurora. please promise me

774
00:28:37.175 --> 00:28:38.176
you'll always
take care of yourself.

775
00:28:38.218 --> 00:28:39.761
and you will stay
out of trouble.

776
00:28:39.803 --> 00:28:41.346
Mother. do not worry.

777
00:28:41.388 --> 00:28:43.264
I do not plan on making a habit
out of this sort of thing.

778
00:28:43.306 --> 00:28:44.182
That's good.

779
00:28:46.351 --> 00:28:47.560
[Sally sighs]

780
00:28:47.602 --> 00:28:49.854
Okay. so my parents want me
to stay with them

781
00:28:49.896 --> 00:28:51.648
until Matt shows up.

782
00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:53.024
They promised they'd help me

783
00:28:53.066 --> 00:28:54.484
finish setting everything up
for the wedding.

784
00:28:54.526 --> 00:28:57.112
The wedding?

785
00:28:57.153 --> 00:28:58.780
Sally. how are you going
to have a wedding

786
00:28:58.822 --> 00:29:00.031
without a groom?

787
00:29:00.073 --> 00:29:01.074
You heard what Arthur said?

788
00:29:01.116 --> 00:29:02.867
Missing grooms always show up.

789
00:29:02.909 --> 00:29:05.161
I'm sure that Matt

790
00:29:05.203 --> 00:29:06.204
is going to come
bursting through the door

791
00:29:06.246 --> 00:29:07.163
any second.

792
00:29:07.205 --> 00:29:08.915
and explain
everything to you.

793
00:29:08.957 --> 00:29:10.625
Of course he will.

794
00:29:12.377 --> 00:29:13.378
Mm-hmm.

795
00:29:14.963 --> 00:29:17.298
All right. well. you call me
if you need anything.

796
00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:18.591
What if what I need

797
00:29:18.633 --> 00:29:20.802
is for you to believe
that Matt will show up?

798
00:29:20.844 --> 00:29:22.178
I'm so sorry
this is happening.

799
00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:23.054
Oh.

800
00:29:25.265 --> 00:29:26.349
Carson!

801
00:29:26.391 --> 00:29:28.101
You've heard from Matt?

802
00:29:28.143 --> 00:29:29.853
No.

803
00:29:29.894 --> 00:29:31.604
No. I'm here to find out
if you have.

804
00:29:33.023 --> 00:29:34.983
No. we still don't know
where he is.

805
00:29:35.025 --> 00:29:36.901
I mean. you're his fiancée.

806
00:29:36.943 --> 00:29:38.862
Surely. you must have some idea
where he went.

807
00:29:38.903 --> 00:29:40.822
some special place
he likes to go.

808
00:29:40.864 --> 00:29:41.823
Don't you think
we'd have looked there

809
00:29:41.865 --> 00:29:42.866
if she knew?

810
00:29:42.907 --> 00:29:43.950
I'm sorry. you're right.

811
00:29:43.992 --> 00:29:46.286
I'm just worried
out of my mind.

812
00:29:48.038 --> 00:29:49.497
[car horn honks]

813
00:29:49.539 --> 00:29:50.957
That's my dad.
I gotta go.

814
00:29:50.999 --> 00:29:52.083
Okay.
Keep me posted?

815
00:29:52.125 --> 00:29:53.585
Yeah.

816
00:29:53.626 --> 00:29:55.503
-Bye.
-Bye.

817
00:29:56.755 --> 00:29:58.381
Sorry to bother.

818
00:29:58.423 --> 00:30:00.008
Hey. Carson.

819
00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:01.968
if you don't mind me asking.

820
00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:05.013
how did you and Matt meet?

821
00:30:05.055 --> 00:30:07.557
We were in the same
web-coding class in college.

822
00:30:07.599 --> 00:30:09.059
He was way better than me.

823
00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.894
so I glommed onto him
when it came to team projects.

824
00:30:10.935 --> 00:30:12.645
That's where he told me
about the idea

825
00:30:12.687 --> 00:30:13.897
for a blogging platform.

826
00:30:13.938 --> 00:30:15.398
and a business dream was born.

827
00:30:16.524 --> 00:30:17.734
So why do you think

828
00:30:17.776 --> 00:30:19.486
Brody Kresser confronted him
like that?

829
00:30:19.527 --> 00:30:21.738
I mean. was it. like.
some kind of rivalry?

830
00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:22.989
Did they know each other--

831
00:30:23.031 --> 00:30:24.407
You know what. I already had
your cop friend

832
00:30:24.449 --> 00:30:25.700
grill me about this.

833
00:30:25.742 --> 00:30:27.285
I don't know
what you're getting at.

834
00:30:27.327 --> 00:30:29.245
but I never heard of the guy.

835
00:30:29.287 --> 00:30:32.957
If he knew Matt. it wasn't
through Giggoblog. okay?

836
00:30:33.708 --> 00:30:34.584
Okay.

837
00:30:34.626 --> 00:30:37.045
I'll see you.

838
00:30:39.839 --> 00:30:42.550
[***]

839
00:30:55.563 --> 00:30:58.274
Roe Teagarden.
what are you still doing here?

840
00:30:58.316 --> 00:31:00.318
Well. I was hoping to do
some research. but...

841
00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:03.029
Researching your thesis topic?

842
00:31:03.071 --> 00:31:06.157
My friend's fiancé. Matt.
went missing.

843
00:31:06.199 --> 00:31:08.952
and while we were
looking for him.

844
00:31:08.993 --> 00:31:10.745
we found a body
under his balcony.

845
00:31:10.787 --> 00:31:13.623
Wait. you found a body?

846
00:31:13.665 --> 00:31:14.958
A dead body?

847
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.751
The police think it's murder.

848
00:31:16.793 --> 00:31:17.711
and I'm afraid
Matt may have killed him

849
00:31:17.752 --> 00:31:18.837
and taken off.

850
00:31:18.878 --> 00:31:20.964
and that's why
no one can find him.

851
00:31:21.006 --> 00:31:23.967
So. what exactly
had you planned to research?

852
00:31:24.009 --> 00:31:27.053
Well. I thought I'd start
with the victim.

853
00:31:27.095 --> 00:31:29.723
maybe look into
Matt's company. or...

854
00:31:29.764 --> 00:31:32.183
Honestly. I'm not really sure.

855
00:31:32.225 --> 00:31:33.685
You're in your second year

856
00:31:33.727 --> 00:31:35.145
of library
and information science.

857
00:31:35.186 --> 00:31:37.939
and you're still
not sure where to start?

858
00:31:37.981 --> 00:31:41.192
Okay. let's...
let's try this.

859
00:31:41.234 --> 00:31:42.694
Um...

860
00:31:42.736 --> 00:31:46.031
what is the seventh principle
of Information Science?

861
00:31:46.072 --> 00:31:47.991
Information can be converted
to knowledge

862
00:31:48.033 --> 00:31:49.617
through
the "knowledge instinct".

863
00:31:49.659 --> 00:31:52.537
So then. where did
your instinct tell you to begin?

864
00:31:52.579 --> 00:31:54.039
With the victim.

865
00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.332
I thought I should learn
everything I could about him.

866
00:31:56.374 --> 00:31:59.210
Did you know that
these computers are connected

867
00:31:59.252 --> 00:32:02.297
to all the university databases?

868
00:32:07.844 --> 00:32:10.013
Okay. so.

869
00:32:10.055 --> 00:32:11.681
now you need
a plan of attack.

870
00:32:11.723 --> 00:32:14.184
Tell me the eighth principle
of information science.

871
00:32:14.225 --> 00:32:17.562
That's the one
on knowledge ecologies. right?

872
00:32:18.772 --> 00:32:20.023
No information stands alone.

873
00:32:20.065 --> 00:32:21.483
All information is produced

874
00:32:21.524 --> 00:32:24.652
within the context
of social relationships. so...

875
00:32:24.694 --> 00:32:25.987
I could start

876
00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:26.738
with Brody Kresser's
family and friends.

877
00:32:28.239 --> 00:32:31.409
Thank you for your help.

878
00:32:36.039 --> 00:32:38.041
We still haven't located
any family for Kresser.

879
00:32:38.083 --> 00:32:39.459
His parents are dead.
no siblings.

880
00:32:39.501 --> 00:32:41.211
I'm working on tracking down
an aunt in New England.

881
00:32:41.252 --> 00:32:42.796
What about work history?

882
00:32:42.837 --> 00:32:44.089
Coming up empty on that. too.

883
00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:45.632
He's never been employed
that I can tell.

884
00:32:45.674 --> 00:32:47.425
Although his parents
seemed pretty well-to-do.

885
00:32:47.467 --> 00:32:49.594
He inherited their house
in Walnut Creek.

886
00:32:51.429 --> 00:32:52.305
Sorry.

887
00:32:52.347 --> 00:32:54.182
So what's he doing up here?

888
00:32:54.224 --> 00:32:56.643
Looking for Matt Walker.
apparently.

889
00:32:56.685 --> 00:32:58.645
Well. the preliminary search
on Walker's condo

890
00:32:58.687 --> 00:32:59.771
came up with nothing.

891
00:32:59.813 --> 00:33:00.939
Nothing
on his cell phone either.

892
00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:02.357
no mysterious calls or texts.

893
00:33:02.399 --> 00:33:04.192
However. the ceramic shard

894
00:33:04.234 --> 00:33:05.485
they found
under the coffee table

895
00:33:05.527 --> 00:33:08.071
is a match to the shard
we found

896
00:33:08.113 --> 00:33:09.531
in the wound
in Kresser's head.

897
00:33:09.572 --> 00:33:11.991
but there's nothing else
matching it in the condo.

898
00:33:12.033 --> 00:33:13.743
So the killer
picked up the pieces?

899
00:33:13.785 --> 00:33:15.412
Yeah...

900
00:33:15.453 --> 00:33:17.747
and hopefully threw them
in a dumpster nearby.

901
00:33:19.165 --> 00:33:21.001
It's too bad the condo
association was too cheap

902
00:33:21.042 --> 00:33:22.627
to spring for security cameras.

903
00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:24.462
And how long

904
00:33:24.504 --> 00:33:26.047
before we get DNA blood results
from the condo?

905
00:33:26.089 --> 00:33:27.674
About 10 days.

906
00:33:27.716 --> 00:33:29.467
but I think it's pretty clear
what happened.

907
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:31.636
Matt Walker lied
about knowing Kresser.

908
00:33:31.678 --> 00:33:33.096
After the altercation
at the party.

909
00:33:33.138 --> 00:33:34.431
Kresser shows up at his place.

910
00:33:34.472 --> 00:33:35.765
they get into another fight.

911
00:33:35.807 --> 00:33:37.017
Walker kills him.

912
00:33:37.058 --> 00:33:38.309
and in a panic.
throws him off the balcony.

913
00:33:38.351 --> 00:33:40.437
then makes himself scarce.

914
00:33:40.478 --> 00:33:42.355
Um. but don't we need
to establish motive first?

915
00:33:43.898 --> 00:33:46.109
Thank you. Smith.
I almost forgot.

916
00:33:46.151 --> 00:33:48.111
After we get
another warrant signed.

917
00:33:48.153 --> 00:33:49.404
we'll bring in
Walker's computers.

918
00:33:49.446 --> 00:33:51.031
I'm sure we'll find
the why there.

919
00:33:51.072 --> 00:33:52.282
I'm not worried.
the evidence is solid.

920
00:33:52.323 --> 00:33:53.992
What we really need to do

921
00:33:54.034 --> 00:33:56.119
is talk to the woman
who was stalking Walker.

922
00:33:56.161 --> 00:33:57.996
the one who said she saw him

923
00:33:58.038 --> 00:33:59.456
standing at his place
last night.

924
00:33:59.497 --> 00:34:00.623
Dawn Palmer.

925
00:34:00.665 --> 00:34:01.791
Yeah.

926
00:34:01.833 --> 00:34:03.960
She's a possible
material witness.

927
00:34:04.002 --> 00:34:06.296
Find her. bring her to me.

928
00:34:06.338 --> 00:34:07.505
and clean up your desk.

929
00:34:18.475 --> 00:34:20.352
[clicking]

930
00:34:24.981 --> 00:34:27.525
No way.

931
00:34:27.567 --> 00:34:29.402
Find something?

932
00:34:29.444 --> 00:34:31.154
An archived
social-media account

933
00:34:31.196 --> 00:34:33.281
belonging to Alice Kresser.

934
00:34:33.323 --> 00:34:34.366
Brody's mother.

935
00:34:36.368 --> 00:34:38.661
Turns out Matt was lying
about not knowing Brody.

936
00:34:40.538 --> 00:34:42.957
I just found
a photo of them together.

937
00:35:00.809 --> 00:35:03.019
So Matt knew the dead guy.

938
00:35:03.061 --> 00:35:05.355
And his parents.

939
00:35:05.397 --> 00:35:06.648
This was posted five years ago.

940
00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:07.857
The caption said

941
00:35:07.899 --> 00:35:10.443
it was Brody's father's
birthday party.

942
00:35:10.485 --> 00:35:12.612
Look. I'm really sorry.

943
00:35:12.654 --> 00:35:15.448
but I have to give this
to the police.

944
00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:17.617
No. Please. you can't do that.

945
00:35:17.659 --> 00:35:18.910
Please. you can't.

946
00:35:18.952 --> 00:35:20.120
They might think that Matt

947
00:35:20.161 --> 00:35:21.621
had something to do
with this guy's death.

948
00:35:21.663 --> 00:35:22.956
and he did not.

949
00:35:22.997 --> 00:35:24.124
There's absolutely no world

950
00:35:24.165 --> 00:35:26.376
in which Matt
would hurt anybody ever.

951
00:35:26.418 --> 00:35:27.711
I hope that's true.

952
00:35:27.752 --> 00:35:29.838
for your sake. for Sally's sake.

953
00:35:32.882 --> 00:35:34.718
Ever since I saw Dawn
yesterday.

954
00:35:34.759 --> 00:35:36.177
I've had this terrible feeling

955
00:35:36.219 --> 00:35:37.971
that maybe she was so upset
about Matt marrying Sally

956
00:35:38.013 --> 00:35:39.347
that she did something to him.

957
00:35:39.389 --> 00:35:41.182
Like. if she can't have him.
then nobody can.

958
00:35:41.224 --> 00:35:43.560
and this Brody guy
got in the way. or...

959
00:35:43.601 --> 00:35:44.978
Hi.

960
00:35:46.271 --> 00:35:47.647
He's here for the photo.

961
00:35:47.689 --> 00:35:51.192
but you should tell him
what you told me about Dawn.

962
00:35:51.234 --> 00:35:52.485
If you're talking about
Dawn Palmer.

963
00:35:52.527 --> 00:35:54.446
we have an APB out on her
right now.

964
00:35:54.487 --> 00:35:57.115
but until then...

965
00:36:01.202 --> 00:36:02.787
...this is not a good look
for your brother.

966
00:36:10.754 --> 00:36:11.963
I've always loved
the tradition

967
00:36:12.005 --> 00:36:13.214
of giving out wedding favors.

968
00:36:13.256 --> 00:36:15.592
you know. so your guests
have a memento

969
00:36:15.633 --> 00:36:17.260
of your special day.

970
00:36:17.302 --> 00:36:21.014
Well. I'm glad your divorce
didn't sour you on marriage.

971
00:36:21.056 --> 00:36:23.141
Oh. no. quite the contrary.

972
00:36:23.183 --> 00:36:26.311
I'm a bigger proponent
than ever.

973
00:36:26.353 --> 00:36:27.604
I took for granted

974
00:36:27.645 --> 00:36:28.980
how much marriage grounds you.
you know.

975
00:36:29.022 --> 00:36:31.775
Everything seems
so much more precarious

976
00:36:31.816 --> 00:36:33.360
when you go it alone.

977
00:36:33.401 --> 00:36:34.277
Do you miss Charles?

978
00:36:36.112 --> 00:36:38.823
Every day.

979
00:36:38.865 --> 00:36:42.869
but he and I made
the logical decision for us.

980
00:36:42.911 --> 00:36:45.580
and so I see no reason
to be maudlin about it.

981
00:36:45.622 --> 00:36:47.290
[door opens and closes]

982
00:36:47.332 --> 00:36:48.958
-[Roe] Hey.
-Hey.

983
00:36:55.215 --> 00:36:56.925
Whatever
Sally needs help with.

984
00:36:56.966 --> 00:36:58.426
I'm willing to help her.

985
00:37:00.303 --> 00:37:01.805
[Sally] I want to be ready
for the wedding.

986
00:37:01.846 --> 00:37:03.098
The rehearsal dinner is tonight.

987
00:37:03.139 --> 00:37:05.392
and I know Matt will be there.

988
00:37:05.433 --> 00:37:07.060
I don't want him to think
I lost faith in him.

989
00:37:07.102 --> 00:37:09.229
'cause I know that he would
never lose faith in me.

990
00:37:10.814 --> 00:37:12.273
Um. Sally?

991
00:37:12.315 --> 00:37:13.900
Hmm?

992
00:37:20.532 --> 00:37:22.200
There's something
you need to see.

993
00:37:26.705 --> 00:37:29.040
Turns out
Matt did know the victim.

994
00:37:34.045 --> 00:37:35.797
This will all make sense

995
00:37:35.839 --> 00:37:38.383
when he comes back
and explains himself.

996
00:37:38.425 --> 00:37:40.552
You'll see.

997
00:37:40.593 --> 00:37:44.222
If you don't mind.
I have to take these to the car.

998
00:37:51.312 --> 00:37:54.899
[slow hold music playing
over phone]

999
00:37:57.861 --> 00:37:58.987
[Detective Cook clearing throat]

1000
00:38:02.741 --> 00:38:06.202
Uh... what is it?

1001
00:38:06.244 --> 00:38:07.746
The medical examiner
just gave me a preview

1002
00:38:07.787 --> 00:38:09.873
of Kresser's autopsy results.

1003
00:38:09.914 --> 00:38:10.749
He's narrowed down
the time of death

1004
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:11.916
between 10:00 PM and midnight

1005
00:38:11.958 --> 00:38:13.043
the night of the party.

1006
00:38:13.084 --> 00:38:15.420
Pretty much
what we figured. right?

1007
00:38:15.462 --> 00:38:16.838
Right.

1008
00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:17.881
He also said the gash
on the victim's head

1009
00:38:17.922 --> 00:38:19.299
was not fatal.

1010
00:38:19.341 --> 00:38:21.134
Broke the skin.
but not the skull.

1011
00:38:21.176 --> 00:38:22.802
The cause of death
was internal bleeding

1012
00:38:22.844 --> 00:38:24.346
from injuries sustained
during the fall.

1013
00:38:24.387 --> 00:38:27.682
So. this might not be
a homicide after all.

1014
00:38:27.724 --> 00:38:29.726
not if Kresser fell on his own.

1015
00:38:29.768 --> 00:38:31.603
Maybe he was pushed.

1016
00:38:31.644 --> 00:38:33.938
Yeah. maybe.

1017
00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:36.941
On the bright side.
we did find Ms. Palmer.

1018
00:38:36.983 --> 00:38:39.235
She was at the Cedarbridge Inn.

1019
00:38:39.277 --> 00:38:41.446
parked in the lot
right next to Matt Walker's car.

1020
00:38:41.488 --> 00:38:45.575
which had been there
since the other night.

1021
00:38:45.617 --> 00:38:48.078
Let's see what she has to say.

1022
00:38:49.954 --> 00:38:51.039
You were seen outside
Matt Walker's condo

1023
00:38:51.081 --> 00:38:52.499
the other night.

1024
00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:53.958
-We've been looking for--
-I don't know what you mean.

1025
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.168
We have a witness who--

1026
00:38:58.505 --> 00:39:01.841
We have a witness
who said she spoke to you.

1027
00:39:01.883 --> 00:39:03.301
and you told her
you followed Matt home

1028
00:39:03.343 --> 00:39:04.844
from his wedding kick-off party.

1029
00:39:04.886 --> 00:39:05.762
Well. she was lying.

1030
00:39:05.804 --> 00:39:07.430
I wasn't there.

1031
00:39:07.472 --> 00:39:08.431
[Detective Cook] Miss Palmer.
you're the one that's lying.

1032
00:39:08.473 --> 00:39:09.933
and I'd like to know why.

1033
00:39:09.974 --> 00:39:11.101
Because
it's none of your business

1034
00:39:11.142 --> 00:39:13.645
if I saw Matt or didn't see him.

1035
00:39:13.687 --> 00:39:16.773
I would never reveal anything
that he told me in confidence.

1036
00:39:16.815 --> 00:39:19.150
not to you. not to anyone.

1037
00:39:19.192 --> 00:39:20.276
[Cook] This is not a game.

1038
00:39:20.318 --> 00:39:22.112
This is a murder investigation.

1039
00:39:22.153 --> 00:39:23.238
and if you're
withholding information--

1040
00:39:23.279 --> 00:39:24.698
I'll never betray Matt.

1041
00:39:24.739 --> 00:39:26.491
Never.

1042
00:39:29.869 --> 00:39:31.955
Well. then. Miss Palmer.

1043
00:39:31.996 --> 00:39:33.415
you can just sit here

1044
00:39:33.456 --> 00:39:35.375
and think about
what it's going to feel like

1045
00:39:35.417 --> 00:39:38.503
when we charge you
with accessory to murder.

1046
00:39:40.463 --> 00:39:42.132
[chair banging]

1047
00:39:48.013 --> 00:39:49.889
I'm thirsty.

1048
00:39:49.931 --> 00:39:52.142
You have a soda machine
around here?

1049
00:39:53.268 --> 00:39:54.144
Really?

1050
00:39:56.021 --> 00:39:57.272
You know. I am impressed

1051
00:39:57.313 --> 00:39:59.149
that you haven't
given up on your search.

1052
00:39:59.190 --> 00:40:00.859
You know. 'cause
information science prescribes

1053
00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:02.110
that you stay on the same track

1054
00:40:02.152 --> 00:40:03.862
until you're sure
you've exhausted it.

1055
00:40:03.903 --> 00:40:05.030
which...

1056
00:40:05.071 --> 00:40:06.322
can be exhausting.

1057
00:40:06.364 --> 00:40:07.907
Well.

1058
00:40:07.949 --> 00:40:09.367
I went into
the court-system database

1059
00:40:09.409 --> 00:40:10.785
for Walnut Creek.

1060
00:40:10.827 --> 00:40:13.580
and look. Brody Kresser's
parents filed for bankruptcy

1061
00:40:13.621 --> 00:40:15.665
just weeks before
Brody's father's car crash.

1062
00:40:15.707 --> 00:40:17.125
That's an intriguing find.

1063
00:40:17.167 --> 00:40:18.626
A strange find.

1064
00:40:18.668 --> 00:40:20.587
because I also found
an archived social media post

1065
00:40:20.628 --> 00:40:22.005
from Brody Kresser's mother

1066
00:40:22.047 --> 00:40:23.006
where she talks about
her husband

1067
00:40:23.048 --> 00:40:24.549
quitting a Silicon Valley job

1068
00:40:24.591 --> 00:40:25.675
for. quote. a new venture.

1069
00:40:26.885 --> 00:40:28.303
Here. I'll show you.

1070
00:40:32.682 --> 00:40:34.017
I-I don't understand.

1071
00:40:34.059 --> 00:40:36.186
Her account is gone.

1072
00:40:36.227 --> 00:40:37.228
It was here. like.
20 minutes ago.

1073
00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:39.064
How could it be deleted?

1074
00:40:39.105 --> 00:40:40.523
Um. well. someone
with override access

1075
00:40:40.565 --> 00:40:41.608
in the archive?

1076
00:40:41.649 --> 00:40:43.360
I do know someone

1077
00:40:43.401 --> 00:40:45.695
who can supposedly do anything
on the Internet.

1078
00:40:56.581 --> 00:40:58.667
[groans] I knew it.

1079
00:40:59.918 --> 00:41:01.878
"Matt. I gave him the cash.

1080
00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.839
and he swears
he won't ask for more."

1081
00:41:09.969 --> 00:41:10.887
What?

1082
00:41:10.929 --> 00:41:11.846
[yelps] Oh!

1083
00:41:14.599 --> 00:41:15.517
[stamping]

1084
00:41:15.558 --> 00:41:18.353
[man grunts]

1085
00:41:20.897 --> 00:41:21.815
Aurora?

1086
00:41:21.856 --> 00:41:23.191
Matt?

1087
00:41:27.737 --> 00:41:30.365
I'm sorry. I...

1088
00:41:30.407 --> 00:41:32.784
I thought you were Dawn. okay?

1089
00:41:32.826 --> 00:41:33.827
She's the only one
I thought would be crazy enough

1090
00:41:33.868 --> 00:41:35.620
to break in here.

1091
00:41:35.662 --> 00:41:36.788
What is wrong with you?

1092
00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:37.914
Do you know how worried
Sally's been?

1093
00:41:37.956 --> 00:41:40.291
I didn't mean to worry her.

1094
00:41:40.333 --> 00:41:43.545
I just had some things
I had to take care of.

1095
00:41:43.586 --> 00:41:45.463
and I didn't have my phone.

1096
00:41:45.505 --> 00:41:47.048
I'm guessing
you left it behind

1097
00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:48.717
so the police couldn't use
cell phone towers to ping you

1098
00:41:48.758 --> 00:41:51.386
and track you down.

1099
00:41:51.428 --> 00:41:53.805
What are you talking about?

1100
00:41:53.847 --> 00:41:54.639
Are you calling Sally?

1101
00:41:54.681 --> 00:41:56.391
Shh! Hey!

1102
00:41:56.433 --> 00:41:57.559
Arthur?

1103
00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.227
Yeah. I. um. I found Matt.

1104
00:41:59.269 --> 00:42:01.021
Mm-hmm.

1105
00:42:01.062 --> 00:42:02.689
Yeah. I'm at his condo.

1106
00:42:02.731 --> 00:42:04.190
Okay.

1107
00:42:04.232 --> 00:42:05.942
Okay. thanks.

1108
00:42:05.984 --> 00:42:07.902
I'm supposed to inform you

1109
00:42:07.944 --> 00:42:09.070
that you need to wait here

1110
00:42:09.112 --> 00:42:10.363
for Detective Cook and Arthur
to arrive.

1111
00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:14.034
Why would I leave?

1112
00:42:14.075 --> 00:42:14.993
I get married tomorrow.

1113
00:42:15.035 --> 00:42:16.786
Really?

1114
00:42:16.828 --> 00:42:18.580
That's why you came back?

1115
00:42:18.621 --> 00:42:19.706
For your wedding?

1116
00:42:19.748 --> 00:42:21.082
Yes.

1117
00:42:21.124 --> 00:42:22.417
Not to get to your computer

1118
00:42:22.459 --> 00:42:24.961
and delete that email
I just saw on your screen?

1119
00:42:25.003 --> 00:42:26.921
Matt. I found a photo
of you and Brody together

1120
00:42:26.963 --> 00:42:28.256
at his father's birthday party.

1121
00:42:28.298 --> 00:42:31.134
I gave a copy to the police.
and I showed Sally.

1122
00:42:31.176 --> 00:42:31.843
You showed Sally?

1123
00:42:31.885 --> 00:42:33.762
Of course I did.

1124
00:42:33.803 --> 00:42:35.930
Now I'm calling Sally.

1125
00:42:35.972 --> 00:42:38.183
She deserves to know
where you've been.

1126
00:42:39.517 --> 00:42:40.393
Your sister. too.

1127
00:42:42.896 --> 00:42:44.647
[Arthur] You jumped
the balcony again?

1128
00:42:44.689 --> 00:42:46.900
Yeah. and when I got in there.

1129
00:42:46.941 --> 00:42:48.777
Matt was deleting stuff
off his computer.

1130
00:42:48.818 --> 00:42:49.611
How'd you even get in there?

1131
00:42:49.652 --> 00:42:50.779
I read a manual

1132
00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:52.197
on how to pick a lock
this morning.

1133
00:42:52.238 --> 00:42:53.323
Of course.

1134
00:42:56.034 --> 00:42:57.577
Sorry.

1135
00:42:57.619 --> 00:42:58.870
Aurora.

1136
00:42:58.912 --> 00:42:59.788
Whoa.
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

1137
00:42:59.829 --> 00:43:01.623
Where is he?
Where's...

1138
00:43:01.664 --> 00:43:03.583
Oh. thank goodness. you're okay.

1139
00:43:03.625 --> 00:43:05.210
I'm sorry. Sally.

1140
00:43:07.253 --> 00:43:08.505
Are you guys arresting him?

1141
00:43:08.546 --> 00:43:10.256
We're just taking him in
to answer some questions.

1142
00:43:10.298 --> 00:43:13.343
Roe. if you get any more ideas
about this case.

1143
00:43:13.385 --> 00:43:15.220
call me first.

1144
00:43:21.267 --> 00:43:23.687
They're just going
to question him. right?

1145
00:43:23.728 --> 00:43:25.105
Um...

1146
00:43:25.146 --> 00:43:26.439
yeah.

1147
00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:43.039
You're free to go.

1148
00:43:43.081 --> 00:43:44.249
Matt!

1149
00:44:04.227 --> 00:44:05.145
I had nothing to do with that.

1150
00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:08.314
You had an altercation
with this guy

1151
00:44:08.356 --> 00:44:09.691
just hours before
this happened to him.

1152
00:44:09.733 --> 00:44:11.234
You lied about knowing him.

1153
00:44:11.276 --> 00:44:13.194
You disappeared
after his murder.

1154
00:44:13.236 --> 00:44:15.447
left your fiancée and friends
and family in the dark.

1155
00:44:15.488 --> 00:44:17.198
I think you had
everything to do with this.

1156
00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:19.284
Look. I know how bad this looks.
but I...

1157
00:44:24.914 --> 00:44:26.499
I don't think I should answer
any more questions

1158
00:44:26.541 --> 00:44:27.751
until I've spoken to a lawyer.

1159
00:44:27.792 --> 00:44:29.627
If you're not
charging me with anything...

1160
00:44:29.669 --> 00:44:30.670
You want to have formal charges?

1161
00:44:32.422 --> 00:44:33.465
Fine.

1162
00:44:33.506 --> 00:44:35.592
Let's see what the D.A.
has to say.

1163
00:44:43.141 --> 00:44:44.684
Sally deserves better.

1164
00:44:47.437 --> 00:44:50.690
I know she does...

1165
00:44:50.732 --> 00:44:51.524
but I do love her.

1166
00:44:53.985 --> 00:44:56.321
Yeah. I understand.

1167
00:44:57.447 --> 00:44:59.032
Well?

1168
00:44:59.074 --> 00:45:01.868
The D.A. won't support
formal charges against Walker.

1169
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:03.828
Says we don't have enough.

1170
00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:04.621
But the victim's blood
is in the condo.

1171
00:45:04.662 --> 00:45:05.413
It's solid evidence.

1172
00:45:05.455 --> 00:45:06.456
Circumstantial.

1173
00:45:06.498 --> 00:45:07.999
The hit on the head
didn't kill him.

1174
00:45:08.041 --> 00:45:09.834
the fall off the balcony did.

1175
00:45:09.876 --> 00:45:11.336
We have no evidence
that Walker pushed him.

1176
00:45:11.378 --> 00:45:13.171
there's no DNA
on Kresser's clothing.

1177
00:45:13.213 --> 00:45:15.090
nothing under his fingernails.

1178
00:45:15.131 --> 00:45:16.925
We can't even place Walker
at the condo

1179
00:45:16.966 --> 00:45:18.259
at the time of death.

1180
00:45:18.301 --> 00:45:19.427
We got no security footage.
no taxi receipts.

1181
00:45:19.469 --> 00:45:21.262
We got nothing.

1182
00:45:21.304 --> 00:45:22.764
Well. if we could get Dawn
to talk to us.

1183
00:45:22.806 --> 00:45:23.890
she could place him
at the condo.

1184
00:45:23.932 --> 00:45:25.308
Good luck with that.

1185
00:45:26.393 --> 00:45:28.770
For now.
we got to cut Walker loose.

1186
00:45:28.812 --> 00:45:30.271
but I want you to tail him.

1187
00:45:30.313 --> 00:45:31.940
No more disappearing suspects.

1188
00:45:31.981 --> 00:45:33.316
You got it.

1189
00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:38.822
[Arthur] Like Cook told you.

1190
00:45:38.863 --> 00:45:41.324
do not under any circumstances
leave town.

1191
00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:47.497
Hi.

1192
00:45:49.874 --> 00:45:52.585
[Kara] Welcome back.
little brother.

1193
00:45:56.548 --> 00:45:58.967
Uh. it's almost time
for the wedding rehearsal.

1194
00:45:59.009 --> 00:46:00.760
We should head
straight to the church.

1195
00:46:00.802 --> 00:46:02.178
[Roe] Um. I'm sorry.

1196
00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:03.888
You've been gone for days.

1197
00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:06.141
we found a body
under your balcony.

1198
00:46:06.182 --> 00:46:07.684
and you want to go on
as if nothing has happened?

1199
00:46:07.726 --> 00:46:09.144
I had nothing to do
with Brody Kresser's death.

1200
00:46:09.185 --> 00:46:11.646
but if you're asking
if I still want to marry Sally.

1201
00:46:11.688 --> 00:46:13.648
the answer is yes.

1202
00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:15.650
of course I do.

1203
00:46:15.692 --> 00:46:18.403
Sally. is that what you want?

1204
00:46:18.445 --> 00:46:19.904
For all of us
to go to the rehearsal?

1205
00:46:19.946 --> 00:46:21.239
Just-just...

1206
00:46:21.281 --> 00:46:23.950
ride to the church
with me. okay?

1207
00:46:23.992 --> 00:46:24.701
I'll explain everything.

1208
00:46:27.537 --> 00:46:29.456
Roe and Kara have been
helping me keep it together

1209
00:46:29.497 --> 00:46:30.540
for two days.

1210
00:46:30.582 --> 00:46:32.917
They deserve
an explanation as well.

1211
00:46:32.959 --> 00:46:34.044
You're right...

1212
00:46:34.085 --> 00:46:36.421
they do...

1213
00:46:37.672 --> 00:46:39.257
...but not here.

1214
00:46:42.177 --> 00:46:45.847
[Sally] Okay.

1215
00:46:45.889 --> 00:46:47.557
[Roe] Why don't we start with
why you lied about knowing Brody

1216
00:46:47.599 --> 00:46:48.725
that night at the party?

1217
00:46:48.767 --> 00:46:50.143
[Matt] I didn't lie.

1218
00:46:50.185 --> 00:46:52.270
I didn't realize it was him
until after he left.

1219
00:46:52.312 --> 00:46:54.564
The son of a friend
I was close to once.

1220
00:46:54.606 --> 00:46:56.024
John Kresser.

1221
00:46:56.066 --> 00:46:57.192
John was a guest speaker

1222
00:46:57.233 --> 00:46:59.027
in one of
my computer science classes.

1223
00:46:59.069 --> 00:47:01.154
He became sort of
a mentor to me.

1224
00:47:01.196 --> 00:47:02.697
I only met Brody once
at a party.

1225
00:47:02.739 --> 00:47:04.199
I barely spoke to the guy.

1226
00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:08.078
John was the one
I was actually friends with...

1227
00:47:08.119 --> 00:47:09.621
until I came up with
the idea for Giggoblog.

1228
00:47:09.662 --> 00:47:11.164
He didn't think it was
a very good idea.

1229
00:47:11.206 --> 00:47:13.917
gave it
some pretty heavy criticism.

1230
00:47:13.958 --> 00:47:15.919
I didn't take it well.

1231
00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:17.337
said some things I regret.

1232
00:47:17.379 --> 00:47:19.381
and we weren't friends
after that.

1233
00:47:19.422 --> 00:47:21.883
Brody was yelling at you
that you owed him.

1234
00:47:21.925 --> 00:47:23.259
What did he think you owe him?

1235
00:47:23.301 --> 00:47:25.345
[Matt] An apology. I guess.

1236
00:47:25.387 --> 00:47:27.722
The apology
I should have gave John.

1237
00:47:27.764 --> 00:47:29.391
He. um...

1238
00:47:29.432 --> 00:47:31.810
died in that car accident
before I had the chance.

1239
00:47:31.851 --> 00:47:33.770
Matt. that's awful.
I'm so sorry.

1240
00:47:33.812 --> 00:47:36.064
What happened with Brody
at the party really threw me.

1241
00:47:36.106 --> 00:47:38.692
so I took a cab
to a bar downtown.

1242
00:47:38.733 --> 00:47:40.068
Dawn Palmer said

1243
00:47:40.110 --> 00:47:42.654
she followed you home
to your condo that night.

1244
00:47:42.696 --> 00:47:43.863
She said she spoke with you.

1245
00:47:43.905 --> 00:47:45.532
Dawn...

1246
00:47:45.573 --> 00:47:48.076
Dawn will say anything.
That didn't happen.

1247
00:47:48.118 --> 00:47:49.536
I didn't get home
until the middle of the night.

1248
00:47:49.577 --> 00:47:50.745
Some guy from the bar
dropped me off.

1249
00:47:50.787 --> 00:47:53.415
A guy?
What was his name?

1250
00:47:53.456 --> 00:47:54.958
I don't know. Fred something.

1251
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.669
Fred Baskin. or Haskins.

1252
00:47:57.711 --> 00:47:59.587
When I got home.
I was still in my head.

1253
00:47:59.629 --> 00:48:01.214
so I went for a walk.

1254
00:48:01.256 --> 00:48:03.800
I ended up at that motel.
the Great 8. near the mall.

1255
00:48:03.842 --> 00:48:06.219
I didn't have my phone.
I didn't have my car.

1256
00:48:06.261 --> 00:48:08.221
I just sat in that room
thinking.

1257
00:48:08.263 --> 00:48:11.474
Thinking about
the Kresser thing.

1258
00:48:11.516 --> 00:48:12.642
about us.

1259
00:48:12.684 --> 00:48:15.270
Worrying I wasn't
good enough for you.

1260
00:48:15.311 --> 00:48:16.813
So you sat in the room
for two days

1261
00:48:16.855 --> 00:48:17.647
and never called me?

1262
00:48:19.607 --> 00:48:20.734
That first morning.

1263
00:48:20.775 --> 00:48:22.694
I turned on the TV.
and I saw the news.

1264
00:48:22.736 --> 00:48:24.946
Brody Kresser's body
found outside my building?

1265
00:48:24.988 --> 00:48:25.989
I got scared.

1266
00:48:26.031 --> 00:48:28.283
I didn't know what to do.

1267
00:48:28.324 --> 00:48:29.117
This morning. I shook it off.

1268
00:48:29.159 --> 00:48:30.118
I walked home and I--

1269
00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:31.703
And used your web skills

1270
00:48:31.745 --> 00:48:34.247
to find Alice Kresser's
archived social-media account

1271
00:48:34.289 --> 00:48:36.374
and delete it.

1272
00:48:36.416 --> 00:48:38.626
Okay. yes.
I deleted some things.

1273
00:48:38.668 --> 00:48:41.254
I remembered seeing
that picture of me and Brody.

1274
00:48:41.296 --> 00:48:43.131
and I was worried that
it wasn't going to look good.

1275
00:48:43.173 --> 00:48:44.090
and guess what?

1276
00:48:44.132 --> 00:48:46.092
I was right.

1277
00:48:46.134 --> 00:48:48.678
but I swear
I didn't do anything to him.

1278
00:48:54.142 --> 00:48:56.811
Sally...

1279
00:48:56.853 --> 00:48:58.229
I'm so sorry.

1280
00:48:58.271 --> 00:48:59.481
I'm an idiot.

1281
00:48:59.522 --> 00:49:01.691
I should have never
put you through that.

1282
00:49:01.733 --> 00:49:03.318
but this whole thing.

1283
00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:05.987
it taught me one thing.

1284
00:49:06.029 --> 00:49:06.988
I love you.

1285
00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:09.449
like crazy.

1286
00:49:09.491 --> 00:49:10.533
and I still want to marry you

1287
00:49:10.575 --> 00:49:12.744
and prove
for the rest of my life

1288
00:49:12.786 --> 00:49:14.454
that I deserve you.

1289
00:49:22.545 --> 00:49:24.339
Okay.

1290
00:49:24.381 --> 00:49:27.175
Why don't we just
go to the wedding rehearsal.

1291
00:49:27.217 --> 00:49:29.469
and we can talk about it later?

1292
00:49:29.511 --> 00:49:30.136
Okay?

1293
00:49:30.178 --> 00:49:30.970
Yeah.

1294
00:49:41.815 --> 00:49:44.693
See. I told you
he'd have an explanation.

1295
00:49:53.493 --> 00:49:54.786
Matt must have told Sally
some story

1296
00:49:54.828 --> 00:49:56.538
to explain himself.

1297
00:49:56.579 --> 00:49:58.373
Oh. yeah. he had quite the story
all right.

1298
00:49:58.415 --> 00:50:00.583
Wouldn't be surprised
if every word of it was a lie.

1299
00:50:00.625 --> 00:50:02.335
Well. Cook wants me
tailing him.

1300
00:50:02.377 --> 00:50:04.421
so maybe
we'll know something soon.

1301
00:50:04.462 --> 00:50:06.006
Is this wedding
really still on?

1302
00:50:06.047 --> 00:50:07.549
I guess so.

1303
00:50:07.590 --> 00:50:08.842
We don't have a lot of time
to prove who did this--

1304
00:50:08.883 --> 00:50:10.218
No. not "we."

1305
00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:11.636
You don't
have to prove anything.

1306
00:50:11.678 --> 00:50:12.929
Detective Cook and the
Lawrenceton Police Department

1307
00:50:12.971 --> 00:50:13.847
have to prove it.

1308
00:50:13.888 --> 00:50:15.432
Fine.

1309
00:50:15.473 --> 00:50:17.559
then you all need to prove this
by 5:00 p.m. tomorrow.

1310
00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:20.520
or we might have to watch
our friend marry a murderer.

1311
00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:23.273
Good point.

1312
00:50:30.071 --> 00:50:31.656
Cook!

1313
00:50:31.698 --> 00:50:32.866
Smith.

1314
00:50:32.907 --> 00:50:34.701
What are you doing here?

1315
00:50:34.743 --> 00:50:35.869
I thought I put you on Walker.

1316
00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:37.203
I got Timms to tail him.

1317
00:50:37.245 --> 00:50:38.538
I thought
you'd want to hear the story

1318
00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:39.539
Walker told his fiancée.

1319
00:50:39.581 --> 00:50:40.832
Did you?

1320
00:50:40.874 --> 00:50:42.792
Yeah. so he was
drinking at a bar

1321
00:50:42.834 --> 00:50:45.086
with some guy who dropped him
at his condo

1322
00:50:45.128 --> 00:50:46.838
before he walked
to the Great 8 Motel.

1323
00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:48.173
Did he spit out a name
for the ride.

1324
00:50:48.214 --> 00:50:50.008
or did he just call him
"some guy"?

1325
00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:52.177
Uh. he said the guy's name
was Fred Baskin

1326
00:50:52.218 --> 00:50:53.345
or maybe Haskins.

1327
00:50:53.386 --> 00:50:56.598
So Walker gets dropped off
at his condo.

1328
00:50:56.639 --> 00:50:57.724
and then for some reason.

1329
00:50:57.766 --> 00:50:58.600
heads over to the Great 8 Motel?

1330
00:50:58.641 --> 00:50:59.684
Yeah.

1331
00:50:59.726 --> 00:51:01.394
Huh.

1332
00:51:01.436 --> 00:51:03.146
Okay. so at least
Walker admits

1333
00:51:03.188 --> 00:51:05.023
to being at his condo
that night.

1334
00:51:05.065 --> 00:51:06.983
Maybe he did cross paths
with Brody Kresser.

1335
00:51:07.025 --> 00:51:08.860
We gotta find this Fred guy.

1336
00:51:08.902 --> 00:51:10.570
He's a witness that places
Walker at the crime scene.

1337
00:51:10.612 --> 00:51:12.739
You find him.

1338
00:51:12.781 --> 00:51:13.907
I'll head over
to the Great 8 Motel.

1339
00:51:13.948 --> 00:51:15.241
make sure that he actually
stayed there.

1340
00:51:15.283 --> 00:51:16.868
Maybe he left
over some evidence.

1341
00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:19.037
perhaps a shard of ceramic.

1342
00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:21.581
Looks like the case
against Walker's

1343
00:51:21.623 --> 00:51:22.749
coming together.

1344
00:51:22.791 --> 00:51:24.459
You should smile. Smith.

1345
00:51:39.724 --> 00:51:40.892
Aurora. hey.

1346
00:51:40.934 --> 00:51:42.143
-[gasps]
-I didn't mean to scare you.

1347
00:51:42.185 --> 00:51:43.395
Just...

1348
00:51:43.436 --> 00:51:44.979
did that rehearsal dinner

1349
00:51:45.021 --> 00:51:46.690
feel like some weird
alternate reality or what?

1350
00:51:46.731 --> 00:51:48.274
Uh. yeah.

1351
00:51:48.316 --> 00:51:49.776
I mean. it was a little strange
that they're going on

1352
00:51:49.818 --> 00:51:51.152
as if nothing
has happened. but--

1353
00:51:51.194 --> 00:51:53.238
I'm curious
what he said to Sally

1354
00:51:53.279 --> 00:51:56.241
to make her forget that
he went missing for two days.

1355
00:51:56.282 --> 00:51:57.701
Uh. I don't know.

1356
00:51:57.742 --> 00:52:00.662
something about wrestling
with self-doubt in a motel room.

1357
00:52:00.704 --> 00:52:02.956
Did he say anything else?

1358
00:52:02.997 --> 00:52:06.543
Anything about Brody Kresser?

1359
00:52:06.584 --> 00:52:08.920
Just that he knew his father.

1360
00:52:08.962 --> 00:52:11.131
Did he say how he knew him?

1361
00:52:11.172 --> 00:52:13.341
He said he was like
some kind of mentor.

1362
00:52:13.383 --> 00:52:14.551
and they had a falling out

1363
00:52:14.592 --> 00:52:15.552
over you guys
starting the blog platform.

1364
00:52:15.593 --> 00:52:17.053
What?

1365
00:52:17.095 --> 00:52:17.971
That...

1366
00:52:18.013 --> 00:52:20.223
Wait. is he going around

1367
00:52:20.265 --> 00:52:22.058
saying that I knew
this John Kresser?

1368
00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:23.518
Did he tell the police that?

1369
00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:25.228
I don't know
anything about him.

1370
00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:26.646
I don't know
what Matt's got himself into.

1371
00:52:26.688 --> 00:52:27.814
but that's on him.

1372
00:52:27.856 --> 00:52:30.150
He's not
dragging me down with him.

1373
00:52:30.191 --> 00:52:31.359
I've got to make some calls.

1374
00:52:31.401 --> 00:52:32.235
Good night.

1375
00:52:38.074 --> 00:52:38.992
What?

1380
00:53:05.935 --> 00:53:07.437
What's it to you?

1381
00:53:07.479 --> 00:53:08.563
I'm looking for a guy

1382
00:53:08.605 --> 00:53:10.148
who might have been here
two nights ago.

1383
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:11.983
Were you here Wednesday night?

1384
00:53:14.152 --> 00:53:15.904
I'll say it again.
what's it to you?

1385
00:53:17.906 --> 00:53:19.491
The guy I'm looking for.

1386
00:53:19.532 --> 00:53:20.450
his name's Fred Baskin.

1387
00:53:20.492 --> 00:53:23.036
or maybe Fred Haskins.

1388
00:53:23.078 --> 00:53:24.788
He supposedly hung out
with this guy.

1389
00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:25.747
and they closed the place down.

1390
00:53:25.789 --> 00:53:26.831
Matty!

1391

00:53:27.916 --> 00:53:29.793
That's what I called him.

Crying in his beer.

1394
00:53:30.919 --> 00:53:32.921
Dude owes me 50 bucks.

1395
00:53:32.962 --> 00:53:34.756
Wait. you're Fred--

1396
00:53:34.798 --> 00:53:35.674
Haskins.

1397
00:53:38.593 --> 00:53:40.053
Can I get you a beer?

1398
00:53:41.221 --> 00:53:42.597
Sure.

Hey.

00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:03.952
Do you mind if I. uh--

1405
00:54:05.787 --> 00:54:08.289
Wow. pretty retro.

1406
00:54:08.331 --> 00:54:09.290
No judging.

1407
00:54:09.332 --> 00:54:11.001
I haven't had time
to redecorate.

1408
00:54:11.042 --> 00:54:12.711
I'm trying to organize
everything I know

1409
00:54:12.752 --> 00:54:14.045
about the Kresser case.

1410
00:54:14.087 --> 00:54:15.380
I thought we agreed

1411
00:54:15.422 --> 00:54:16.423
you weren't going to get
involved in this case.

1412
00:54:16.464 --> 00:54:18.091
or put yourself
in danger anymore.

1413
00:54:18.133 --> 00:54:19.300
Arthur. how is me
writing things down

1414
00:54:19.342 --> 00:54:20.301
in my own bedroom

1415
00:54:20.343 --> 00:54:22.053
getting involved?

1416
00:54:22.095 --> 00:54:24.180
It's just me
writing things down.

1417
00:54:24.222 --> 00:54:26.433
Now. tell me everything
you know that I don't. Hmm?

1418
00:54:26.474 --> 00:54:27.767
Okay. I know this.

1419
00:54:27.809 --> 00:54:28.935
Cook confirmed

1420
00:54:28.977 --> 00:54:30.395
Matt did stay
at the Great 8 Motel

1421
00:54:30.437 --> 00:54:31.646
for two days.

1422
00:54:31.688 --> 00:54:34.107
I found this Fred Haskins
Matt told you about.

1423
00:54:34.149 --> 00:54:35.900
He was there that night
drinking with Matt.

1424
00:54:35.942 --> 00:54:38.111
from 9:30 until
they shut the place down.

1425
00:54:38.153 --> 00:54:41.281
Haskins then gave Matt
a ride home at 2:30 a.m..

1426
00:54:41.322 --> 00:54:44.367
way past Brody Kresser's
estimated time of death.

1427
00:54:44.409 --> 00:54:46.369
So it seems
Matt does have an alibi.

1428
00:54:46.411 --> 00:54:48.371
Okay.

1429
00:54:48.413 --> 00:54:50.832
So...

1430
00:54:50.874 --> 00:54:52.167
So good.

1431
00:54:52.208 --> 00:54:53.877
So Sally's not about
to marry a murderer.

1432
00:54:53.918 --> 00:54:56.463
Wait. where did this photo
come from?

1433
00:54:59.507 --> 00:55:01.301
The same party
this photo was taken--

1434
00:55:01.343 --> 00:55:03.887
John Kresser's birthday
four years ago.

1435
00:55:03.928 --> 00:55:05.388
That's John.

1436
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:07.223
Caption said that guy's name
is Albert Paulson.

1437
00:55:07.265 --> 00:55:08.683
It didn't say who that guy is.

1438
00:55:08.725 --> 00:55:09.809
I know who he is.

1439
00:55:09.851 --> 00:55:11.686
I just talked to him
for an hour.

1440
00:55:11.728 --> 00:55:14.522
That's Fred Haskins.

1441
00:55:14.564 --> 00:55:16.149
Matt and Haskins
didn't meet at the bar.

1442
00:55:16.191 --> 00:55:17.692
They knew each other
through John Kresser.

1443
00:55:20.278 --> 00:55:21.613
So Matt's alibi is fake.

1444
00:55:25.116 --> 00:55:27.702
[groans] We are right back
where we started.

1445
00:55:27.744 --> 00:55:31.247
Arthur. what am I
supposed to do?

1446
00:55:31.289 --> 00:55:33.625
I'm supposed to meet
Sally and Kara in the morning.

1447
00:55:33.667 --> 00:55:35.752
and I'm not sure I'm expected
to just waltz down the aisle

1448
00:55:35.794 --> 00:55:37.671
when Sally is probably
going to marry a murderer...

1449
00:55:39.506 --> 00:55:41.383
...or if it's not him.
it's his best man.

1450
00:55:41.424 --> 00:55:42.842
who was very paranoid
about John Kresser's death.

1451
00:55:42.884 --> 00:55:44.177
Oh. really?

1452
00:55:44.219 --> 00:55:45.345
Then there's creepy Dawn

1453
00:55:45.387 --> 00:55:46.846
who just keeps
showing up everywhere.

1454
00:55:46.888 --> 00:55:48.640
I mean. if we can't prove
who this is before the wedding.

1455
00:55:48.682 --> 00:55:50.350
it's going to feel like a bomb
is sitting under the church.

1456
00:55:50.392 --> 00:55:51.476
First off.

1457
00:55:51.518 --> 00:55:52.769
we'll have a tail on Matt
the whole day.

1458
00:55:52.811 --> 00:55:55.188
That means Carson will be
under surveillance. too.

1459
00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:56.815
That's great. but wouldn't
solving the case be better?

1460
00:55:56.856 --> 00:55:58.692
-Roe!
-Let me help.

1461
00:55:58.733 --> 00:56:00.610
Come on. think about it.

1462
00:56:00.652 --> 00:56:03.154
You wouldn't know that Matt
faked his alibi

1463
00:56:03.196 --> 00:56:04.572
if I hadn't found that photo.

1464
00:56:04.614 --> 00:56:05.532
Hmm?

1465
00:56:06.866 --> 00:56:08.368
[chuckles]

1466
00:56:08.410 --> 00:56:09.619
Fine.

1467
00:56:09.661 --> 00:56:10.745
but promise me

1468
00:56:10.787 --> 00:56:11.996
that if you come up with
any leads.

1469
00:56:12.038 --> 00:56:14.749
you won't go chasing after them
on your own.

1470
00:56:14.791 --> 00:56:17.669
Fine. I promise.

1471
00:56:17.711 --> 00:56:18.837
Okay.

1472
00:56:20.463 --> 00:56:22.090
You know...

1473
00:56:22.132 --> 00:56:24.092
life was starting to seem
nice and predictable.

1474
00:56:24.134 --> 00:56:26.177
even a bit boring...

1475
00:56:28.763 --> 00:56:30.223
...then you came back to town.

1476
00:56:32.684 --> 00:56:33.727
You're welcome.

1477
00:56:33.768 --> 00:56:34.602
[chuckles]

1478
00:56:36.521 --> 00:56:38.231
[***]

1479
00:56:47.991 --> 00:56:50.785
Okay. Albert Paulson.

1480
00:56:50.827 --> 00:56:53.038
let's find out who you are.

1481
00:56:53.079 --> 00:56:55.623
[***]

1482
00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:58.084
It's cold today.

1483
00:56:58.126 --> 00:56:59.961
I'm glad it's not
an outdoor wedding.

1484
00:57:00.003 --> 00:57:01.588
You're a little early.
aren't you?

1485
00:57:01.629 --> 00:57:03.256
Well. I didn't want you
to have to do all the work.

1486
00:57:03.298 --> 00:57:05.258
I thought I could help chop
or stir or something.

1487
00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:06.843
Ah. don't worry about it.

1488
00:57:06.885 --> 00:57:08.636
I'm making a prosciutto quiche
with spinach and feta cheese.

1489
00:57:08.678 --> 00:57:09.763
Wow.

1490
00:57:09.804 --> 00:57:11.306
That sounds incredible.

1491
00:57:11.348 --> 00:57:13.058
I really didn't mean for you
to go through that much trouble.

1492
00:57:13.099 --> 00:57:14.517
It's your best friend's
wedding.

1493
00:57:14.559 --> 00:57:16.394
Plus. I'm a sucker for romance.

1494
00:57:17.395 --> 00:57:18.438
Hmm.

1495
00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:20.440
I don't have time for romance.

1496
00:57:20.482 --> 00:57:22.734
Between writing a thesis
and having two jobs.

1497
00:57:22.776 --> 00:57:23.485
I have no time to date.

1498
00:57:24.569 --> 00:57:27.322
You're going
to a wedding tonight.

1499
00:57:27.364 --> 00:57:29.741
Feels like a perfect occasion
for a date.

1500
00:57:31.326 --> 00:57:34.829
Are you trying to get me
to bring you as my date?

1501
00:57:34.871 --> 00:57:36.164
Is it working?

1502
00:57:37.374 --> 00:57:38.291
Maybe.

1503
00:57:38.333 --> 00:57:39.376
[cell phone ringing]

1504
00:57:39.417 --> 00:57:41.336
Oh. um...

1505
00:57:41.378 --> 00:57:43.296
Hi. this is Roe Teagarden.

1506
00:57:43.338 --> 00:57:44.464
Is this Albert Paulson?

1507
00:57:44.506 --> 00:57:46.633
As if he'd be here
on a Saturday!

1508
00:57:46.675 --> 00:57:48.385
No. I'm his paralegal.

1509
00:57:48.426 --> 00:57:50.679
I screen emails
from our contact inbox.

1510
00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:52.222
You said
you're researching a story

1511
00:57:52.263 --> 00:57:53.682
about John Kresser?

1512
00:57:53.723 --> 00:57:55.308
So to speak.

1513
00:57:55.350 --> 00:57:56.726
I know that John Kresser
and your boss

1514
00:57:56.768 --> 00:57:57.936
were very close friends.

1515
00:57:57.977 --> 00:57:59.437
Like brothers.

1516
00:57:59.479 --> 00:58:00.939
Ah. such a sweetheart.

1517
00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:03.650
I don't think I'll ever
get over him dying like he did.

1518
00:58:03.692 --> 00:58:04.859
So sad.

1519
00:58:04.901 --> 00:58:06.027
and so weird

1520
00:58:06.069 --> 00:58:07.237
and out of nowhere.

1521
00:58:07.278 --> 00:58:08.905
Um. are you saying

1522
00:58:08.947 --> 00:58:09.948
that John Kresser's death

1523
00:58:09.989 --> 00:58:11.366
was suspicious?

1524
00:58:11.408 --> 00:58:13.618
He dies in an accident

1525
00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:16.121
three days before he was
about to file his lawsuit?

1526
00:58:16.162 --> 00:58:18.748
Why the police chose
not to investigate it.

1527
00:58:18.790 --> 00:58:19.624
I'll never know.

1528
00:58:19.666 --> 00:58:20.792
Wait. wait.

1529
00:58:20.834 --> 00:58:23.670
John Kresser
was going to file a lawsuit?

1530
00:58:23.712 --> 00:58:26.840
[***]

1531
00:58:26.881 --> 00:58:28.341
[giggling]

1532
00:58:30.051 --> 00:58:31.052
[Sally] Hey. Roe!

1533
00:58:31.094 --> 00:58:32.178
It's your wedding day!

1534
00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:34.347
I'm so nervous.

1535
00:58:34.389 --> 00:58:35.890
Okay. so I had this dream
last night

1536
00:58:35.932 --> 00:58:38.226
that I put on my wedding dress.
and it turned black.

1537
00:58:38.268 --> 00:58:39.728
Do you think that's a bad omen?

1538
00:58:41.062 --> 00:58:42.397
I hope you're hungry.

1539
00:58:42.439 --> 00:58:43.857
'cause my friend. Daniel.
is making us a feast.

1540
00:58:43.898 --> 00:58:45.650
Oh. I forgot.

1541
00:58:45.692 --> 00:58:46.985
I have to grab my bridesmaids'
presents out of my car--

1542
00:58:47.027 --> 00:58:48.319
That's okay. I'll go grab them.

1543
00:58:48.361 --> 00:58:50.196
You are the best.

1544
00:58:50.238 --> 00:58:52.907
Oh. you know what.
why don't you take this?

1545
00:58:52.949 --> 00:58:54.075
It's really cold.

1546
00:58:54.117 --> 00:58:55.285
Keys are in the pocket.

1547
00:58:55.326 --> 00:58:57.203
Presents are in the trunk.

1548
00:58:57.245 --> 00:58:58.580
-Thank you!
-[cell phone ringing]

1549
00:58:58.621 --> 00:58:59.873
Okay. Oh!

1550
00:58:59.914 --> 00:59:00.749
Look at all this!

1551
00:59:00.790 --> 00:59:02.375
Arthur. hey.

1552
00:59:02.417 --> 00:59:04.085
Please tell me
you have the evidence you need

1553
00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:05.170
to make an arrest today.

1554
00:59:05.211 --> 00:59:06.379
[Arthur] Not yet.

1555
00:59:06.421 --> 00:59:08.006
but I found
a report for the crash

1556
00:59:08.048 --> 00:59:09.716
that killed John Kresser.

1557
00:59:09.758 --> 00:59:11.134
His car broke through
the guard rail.

1558
00:59:11.176 --> 00:59:13.803
went off into a ravine.

1559
00:59:13.845 --> 00:59:15.555
Also. I spoke with Carson
this morning.

1560
00:59:15.597 --> 00:59:18.141
asked him about that
and about Haskins.

1561
00:59:18.183 --> 00:59:19.601
He didn't respond well.

1562
00:59:19.642 --> 00:59:21.144
Refused to talk to us
without his lawyer present.

1563
00:59:21.186 --> 00:59:22.937
Then there's Dawn.

1564
00:59:22.979 --> 00:59:25.106
What about her?

1565
00:59:25.148 --> 00:59:26.983
Well. Cook has me
tailing her today.

1566
00:59:27.025 --> 00:59:29.527
and she has decided
to tail Sally.

1567
00:59:29.569 --> 00:59:30.945
She's outside the diner

1568
00:59:30.987 --> 00:59:32.447
you guys are
having breakfast at right now.

1569
00:59:32.489 --> 00:59:34.824
sitting in her car
in the parking lot.

1570
00:59:34.866 --> 00:59:36.326
If she makes a move
on the diner.

1571
00:59:36.368 --> 00:59:39.287
I'll arrest her for harassment.

1572
00:59:39.329 --> 00:59:42.123
Good to know
Officer Smith is on the job.

1573
00:59:42.165 --> 00:59:43.833
You getting out of here?

1574
00:59:43.875 --> 00:59:44.876
Oh. no. I'll be right back!

1575
00:59:44.918 --> 00:59:46.795
Oh. don't let me forget.

1576
00:59:46.836 --> 00:59:47.837
After breakfast.

1577
00:59:47.879 --> 00:59:49.214
I have to tell you
about a lawsuit

1578
00:59:49.255 --> 00:59:51.091
John Kresser was about to file
before he died.

1579
00:59:51.132 --> 00:59:52.258
I convinced
his lawyer's paralegal

1580
00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:53.301
to fax me over a draft copy.

1581
00:59:53.343 --> 00:59:54.260
I'll call you after.

1582
00:59:54.302 --> 00:59:55.261
A lawsuit?

1583
00:59:55.303 --> 00:59:57.514
After breakfast.

1584
01:00:03.937 --> 01:00:05.689
[engine revving. tires skidding]

1585
01:00:07.148 --> 01:00:07.816
[Arthur's voice echoing] Roe!

1586

[tires skidding]

1587
01:00:20.245 --> 01:00:22.831
Roe! Roe!

1588
01:00:22.872 --> 01:00:24.082
Are you okay?

1589
01:00:24.124 --> 01:00:25.166
-Yeah. I'm okay. Are you okay?
-Yeah.

1590
01:00:25.208 --> 01:00:26.334
Roe. you okay?

1591
01:00:26.376 --> 01:00:27.460
Yeah. I'm fine.

1592
01:00:31.006 --> 01:00:32.173
You okay?

1593
01:00:32.215 --> 01:00:33.633
Are you okay?

1594
01:00:33.675 --> 01:00:34.467
I want you
to get out of the vehicle.

1595
01:00:34.509 --> 01:00:36.803
slowly raise your hands.

1596
01:00:36.845 --> 01:00:39.014
There you go.
Are you carrying a weapon?

1597
01:00:41.850 --> 01:00:44.102
You may have just helped
catch a killer.

1598
01:00:56.781 --> 01:00:57.907
I wasn't trying to get her.

1599
01:00:57.949 --> 01:00:59.325
I thought it was Sally.

1600
01:00:59.367 --> 01:01:00.869
I had to stop her
from trying to marry my Matt!

1601
01:01:06.166 --> 01:01:07.334
[Sally] You were almost killed

1602
01:01:07.375 --> 01:01:08.626
because she thought you were me.

1603
01:01:08.668 --> 01:01:10.420
Sally. I'm okay.

1604
01:01:10.462 --> 01:01:11.671
[Arthur]
You sure you're okay. Roe?

1605
01:01:11.713 --> 01:01:12.714
Yeah.

1606
01:01:12.756 --> 01:01:13.840
Just cold.

1607
01:01:13.882 --> 01:01:15.175
Here. you can borrow this.

1608
01:01:15.216 --> 01:01:16.718
No. it's okay. Arthur. really.

1609
01:01:19.512 --> 01:01:20.472
Thank you.

1610
01:01:20.513 --> 01:01:21.348
Of course.

1611
01:01:25.143 --> 01:01:26.269
[Arthur] I told you

1612
01:01:26.311 --> 01:01:27.604
getting involved
in this case was trouble.

1613
01:01:27.645 --> 01:01:30.190
Arthur. I was just
getting presents out of the car.

1614
01:01:30.231 --> 01:01:31.483
[Kara] But clearly.
Dawn is violent

1615
01:01:31.524 --> 01:01:33.401
and not as harmless
as Matt thought.

1616
01:01:33.443 --> 01:01:35.695
I mean. she must be the one
who killed Brody. right?

1617
01:01:35.737 --> 01:01:38.365
Maybe she thought
she was protecting him?

1618
01:01:38.406 --> 01:01:40.617
It's a possibility.
but we're still investigating.

1619
01:01:40.658 --> 01:01:42.577
How am I
supposed to get married

1620
01:01:42.619 --> 01:01:44.537
when my best friend
was nearly run over?

1621
01:01:44.579 --> 01:01:45.622
[Arthur] Postponing the wedding

1622
01:01:45.663 --> 01:01:46.915
until we find out
who killed Kresser

1623
01:01:46.956 --> 01:01:48.541
might not be a bad idea. Sal.

1624
01:01:48.583 --> 01:01:50.627
Yeah. I mean. maybe
just for a week or two?

1625
01:01:53.546 --> 01:01:54.714
Maybe that's what's best.

1626
01:01:56.049 --> 01:01:56.883
[Kara] What are you guys
talking about?

1627
01:01:56.925 --> 01:01:58.927
How is that what's best?

1628
01:01:58.968 --> 01:02:00.178
Dawn wanted
to stop the wedding.

1629
01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:02.347
and now you're going
to let her have her way?

1630
01:02:06.893 --> 01:02:08.978
You're right.

1631
01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:13.191
I'm not going to let Dawn
take mine and Matt's happiness.

1632
01:02:13.233 --> 01:02:14.401
[sniffles]

1633
01:02:14.442 --> 01:02:16.569
Let's go back inside.

1634
01:02:16.611 --> 01:02:17.612
Okay?

1635
01:02:26.121 --> 01:02:27.664
I gotta say thanks

1636
01:02:27.706 --> 01:02:28.665
for pulling Roe out of the way
of that car.

1637
01:02:31.209 --> 01:02:34.421
I wasn't sure
if I was about to watch her...

1638
01:02:37.632 --> 01:02:39.509
Anyway. uh. Roe.

1639
01:02:39.551 --> 01:02:41.428
I'll let you know
what happens with Dawn.

1640
01:02:41.469 --> 01:02:44.305
and then I'd like
to see that lawsuit.

1641
01:02:51.062 --> 01:02:52.647
[Daniel]
I'd say that guy's into you.

1642
01:02:52.689 --> 01:02:54.482
Arthur?

1643
01:02:54.524 --> 01:02:57.318
No. for as long
as we've been friends?

1644
01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:59.362
Hey. you want to keep him
in the friend zone.

1645
01:02:59.404 --> 01:03:01.031
I'm not gonna argue.

1646
01:03:02.782 --> 01:03:04.451
I've got to get
that quiche out of the oven.

1647
01:03:22.302 --> 01:03:25.138
[Dawn] Oh. my god.
you're totally overreacting.

1648
01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:28.433
Yeah. I tried to hit Sally.
but I wasn't trying to kill her.

1649
01:03:28.475 --> 01:03:29.768
I just wanted to maybe
break her leg a little bit

1650
01:03:29.809 --> 01:03:31.353
so she couldn't
walk down the aisle.

1651
01:03:34.022 --> 01:03:35.732
You think I'm crazy.

1652
01:03:35.774 --> 01:03:37.817
Well. I'm not.

1653
01:03:37.859 --> 01:03:41.654
Sally isn't the goody-two-shoes
that you think.

1654
01:03:41.696 --> 01:03:44.449
She somehow tricked Matt
into marrying her.

1655
01:03:44.491 --> 01:03:47.827
when I know that I'm the one
that he really loves.

1656
01:03:47.869 --> 01:03:50.789
Okay. so you tried
to break Sally's legs

1657
01:03:50.830 --> 01:03:51.706
to help Matt.

1658
01:03:53.625 --> 01:03:55.752
Did you try breaking
Brody Kresser's head

1659
01:03:55.794 --> 01:03:56.628
to help Matt. too?

1660
01:03:57.754 --> 01:03:58.588
Brody who?

1661
01:04:01.257 --> 01:04:03.218
Is this your handiwork?

1662
01:04:03.259 --> 01:04:05.095
Did you attack this man
in Matt's condo.

1663
01:04:05.136 --> 01:04:06.513
then push him off the balcony?

1664
01:04:06.554 --> 01:04:08.390
No. I did not do that.

1665
01:04:08.431 --> 01:04:09.683
[Arthur] But you were
at his condo that night.

1666
01:04:09.724 --> 01:04:10.850
the night of the party?

1667
01:04:10.892 --> 01:04:13.770
You told my friend
that you saw Matt.

1668
01:04:13.812 --> 01:04:15.772
What time
did you see him there?

1669
01:04:15.814 --> 01:04:18.274
If I saw Matt.
I wouldn't tell you.

1670
01:04:18.316 --> 01:04:21.986
I will never betray Matt.

1671
01:04:22.028 --> 01:04:24.489
Never.

1672
01:04:35.375 --> 01:04:37.043
Oh!

1673
01:04:37.085 --> 01:04:39.754
I'm just going to place this
on the bridal table.

1674
01:04:41.006 --> 01:04:44.634
Oh. Sally did
such a fantastic job decorating.

1675
01:04:44.676 --> 01:04:47.178
Ah. yes. she's quite talented.

1676
01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:48.805
I have a friend

1677
01:04:48.847 --> 01:04:50.932
who is. uh. interested
in selling her home.

1678
01:04:50.974 --> 01:04:53.560
and I recommended you
as a listing agent.

1679
01:04:53.601 --> 01:04:55.562
She's expecting eight figures

1680
01:04:55.603 --> 01:04:58.106
and is very particular.

1681
01:04:58.148 --> 01:05:00.608
Well. thank you
for the recommendation. Gladys.

1682
01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:03.403
but you know. my office hasn't
been very productive lately.

1683
01:05:03.445 --> 01:05:05.071
so maybe after I get
a few more listings.

1684
01:05:05.113 --> 01:05:06.364
I could call her--

1685
01:05:06.406 --> 01:05:08.199
I told her that you were
a very skilled woman

1686
01:05:08.241 --> 01:05:09.743
with rare gumption.

1687
01:05:09.784 --> 01:05:12.912
and you'd be very enthusiastic
about helping her out.

1688
01:05:12.954 --> 01:05:14.581
Was I mistaken?

1689
01:05:14.622 --> 01:05:15.915
No.

1690
01:05:15.957 --> 01:05:19.169
I... I just may have mislaid
my gumption lately.

1691
01:05:19.210 --> 01:05:21.379
Well. I suggest
that you find it

1692
01:05:21.421 --> 01:05:23.131
before you give her a call.

1693
01:05:23.173 --> 01:05:25.008
I've got her card right here.

1694
01:05:25.050 --> 01:05:26.051
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

1695
01:05:27.677 --> 01:05:29.471
Morning. Aida.
Aunt Gladys.

1696
01:05:29.512 --> 01:05:31.097
-Hello.
-Hi!

1697
01:05:31.139 --> 01:05:31.931
Just dropping off
the champagne.

1698
01:05:31.973 --> 01:05:32.974
Splendid.

1699
01:05:34.684 --> 01:05:35.810
Matthew!

1700
01:05:36.853 --> 01:05:37.937
Carson.

1701
01:05:37.979 --> 01:05:39.773
Where you been. buddy?

1702
01:05:39.814 --> 01:05:41.441
You're ducking
your best-man duties.

1703
01:05:41.483 --> 01:05:42.734
What's with this text
you sent me?

1704
01:05:42.776 --> 01:05:45.111
You grabbing screenshots
of our emails?

1705
01:05:45.153 --> 01:05:46.279
I want that flash drive--

1706
01:05:46.321 --> 01:05:48.073
Shh!

1707
01:05:50.784 --> 01:05:53.286
I told you.
I'm not gonna use it.

1708
01:05:53.328 --> 01:05:54.746
I just wanted some insurance

1709
01:05:54.788 --> 01:05:58.249
to make sure you don't do to me
what you did to John.

1710
01:05:58.291 --> 01:05:59.542
Look. I will give you the drive

1711
01:05:59.584 --> 01:06:01.503
after the sale goes through.

1712
01:06:01.544 --> 01:06:02.837
and I get my half of the money.

1713
01:06:02.879 --> 01:06:04.005
You don't want to play
that game with me.

1714
01:06:04.047 --> 01:06:05.548
especially not
when Sally's cop friend

1715
01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:06.675
is asking me about Fred Haskins.

1716
01:06:08.343 --> 01:06:10.095
Haskins. Matt!

1717
01:06:10.136 --> 01:06:10.970
You pulled him into this?

1718
01:06:11.012 --> 01:06:11.846
You're an idiot.

1719
01:06:11.888 --> 01:06:12.931
[Matt] Why?

1720
01:06:12.972 --> 01:06:14.015
Because I don't want
to take the blame

1721
01:06:14.057 --> 01:06:15.183
for something I didn't do?

1722
01:06:15.225 --> 01:06:17.644
Always playing innocent.
but I know better.

1723
01:06:17.686 --> 01:06:19.813
There's no way I'm going
to let you use Haskins

1724
01:06:19.854 --> 01:06:21.106
to set me up to take the fall
for what you did.

1725
01:06:25.402 --> 01:06:27.821
Matt. is everything okay?

1726
01:06:27.862 --> 01:06:29.489
Uh...

1727
01:06:29.531 --> 01:06:30.990
yeah. yeah. everything's great.

1728
01:06:31.032 --> 01:06:34.077
We're just a little on edge
about the big event.

1729
01:06:34.119 --> 01:06:35.912
-Weddings.
-Yeah.

1730
01:06:35.954 --> 01:06:37.997
You know what.
there's another box outside.

1731
01:06:38.039 --> 01:06:39.374
I'm gonna go grab it.

1732
01:06:39.416 --> 01:06:40.542
Okay.

1733
01:06:48.341 --> 01:06:50.552
[cell phone ringing]

1734
01:06:51.553 --> 01:06:52.804
Hey. Arthur.

1735
01:06:52.846 --> 01:06:53.805
I'm just on my way
to meet Sally and Kara.

1736
01:06:53.847 --> 01:06:54.723
What's up?

1737
01:06:54.764 --> 01:06:55.807
Well. despite Dawn Palmer

1738
01:06:55.849 --> 01:06:57.517
trying to run down
her ex's bride.

1739
01:06:57.559 --> 01:06:59.686
she didn't kill Brody Kresser.

1740
01:06:59.728 --> 01:07:00.603
In fact. she was nowhere near
Matt's condo building

1741
01:07:00.645 --> 01:07:02.564
that night.

1742
01:07:02.605 --> 01:07:04.566
Her father showed us proof
that she was with him.

1743
01:07:04.607 --> 01:07:06.818
and the restaurant
they were at confirmed.

1744
01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:08.486
Well. I guess
that's good for her.

1745
01:07:08.528 --> 01:07:10.030
but bad for Sally.

1746
01:07:10.071 --> 01:07:11.197
I mean. that means Matt

1747
01:07:11.239 --> 01:07:12.240
is still most likely
the one who did it.

1748
01:07:12.282 --> 01:07:13.491
Maybe. maybe not.

1749
01:07:13.533 --> 01:07:15.285
We just got access
to security footage

1750
01:07:15.326 --> 01:07:16.911
taken from the Cedarbridge Inn
the night of the party.

1751
01:07:16.953 --> 01:07:18.371
And?

1752
01:07:18.413 --> 01:07:19.622
Well. it seems

1753
01:07:19.664 --> 01:07:22.250
Carson confronted Brody
after they left.

1754
01:07:22.292 --> 01:07:23.668
and it clearly got physical.

1755
01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:25.003
I don't know.

1756
01:07:25.045 --> 01:07:26.504
Something's missing.

1757
01:07:26.546 --> 01:07:28.131
So why don't you tell me

1758
01:07:28.173 --> 01:07:29.466
what's in that lawsuit
you've been talking about?

1759
01:07:29.507 --> 01:07:32.218
Well. I don't really know
what's in it yet.

1760
01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:33.511
I mean. I had it faxed

1761
01:07:33.553 --> 01:07:35.138
to the only place I know
with a fax machine--

1762
01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:36.222
my professor's office.

1763
01:07:36.264 --> 01:07:38.266
but look.

1764
01:07:38.308 --> 01:07:39.726
I'm supposed to meet
Sally and Kara at the salon.

1765
01:07:39.768 --> 01:07:41.561
but I'll go pick up
the lawsuit document

1766
01:07:41.603 --> 01:07:42.479
and call you back from there?

1767
01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:43.271
Sounds good.

1768
01:07:44.939 --> 01:07:46.107
[groans]

1769
01:07:50.111 --> 01:07:52.405
[sighs]

1770
01:07:52.447 --> 01:07:54.824
You look beautiful. Sally.

1771
01:07:54.866 --> 01:07:56.409
I just...

1772
01:07:56.451 --> 01:07:58.536
Oh. I needed to try it on
one last time.

1773
01:07:58.578 --> 01:07:59.621
With everything
that's happened.

1774
01:07:59.662 --> 01:08:00.413
I was just really nervous.
[chuckles]

1775
01:08:00.455 --> 01:08:02.165
Yeah.

1776
01:08:02.207 --> 01:08:03.416
Well. it's going to be okay.

1777
01:08:03.458 --> 01:08:05.126
Okay? I promise personally.

1778
01:08:07.462 --> 01:08:09.964
Let me get your veil
and my bubbles.

1779
01:08:10.006 --> 01:08:11.466
[laughing]

1780
01:08:11.508 --> 01:08:12.425
We have so much to do
before the ceremony.

1781
01:08:12.467 --> 01:08:13.593
I love you.

1782
01:08:13.635 --> 01:08:14.552
-Love you.
-See you soon.

1783
01:08:14.594 --> 01:08:16.388
Hey.

1784
01:08:16.429 --> 01:08:18.098
Carson!

1785
01:08:18.139 --> 01:08:19.849
[giggling]

1786
01:08:19.891 --> 01:08:21.559
I'm sorry to do this. Sally.

1787
01:08:21.601 --> 01:08:22.894
I really am--

1788
01:08:22.936 --> 01:08:25.730
Okay. Sally.
I really need to talk to you!

1789
01:08:25.772 --> 01:08:27.315
Roe. your hair.
why haven't you--

1790
01:08:27.357 --> 01:08:28.441
Okay. forget about my hair.

1791
01:08:28.483 --> 01:08:29.317
there is something
really important

1792
01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:30.360
I need to tell you--

1793
01:08:30.402 --> 01:08:31.986
What you both need to do

1794
01:08:32.028 --> 01:08:34.197
is stop talking

1795
01:08:34.239 --> 01:08:35.657
and listen to me.

1796
01:08:48.294 --> 01:08:49.838
[Carson] No need
to fall apart on me. Sally.

1797
01:08:49.879 --> 01:08:51.214
I'm not going to hurt you.

1798
01:08:51.256 --> 01:08:53.633
I just need to get
Matt's attention.

1799
01:08:53.675 --> 01:08:55.260
and get him to hand me
a flash drive

1800
01:08:55.301 --> 01:08:56.886
that he's using to threaten me.

1801
01:08:56.928 --> 01:08:58.763
Why would Matt
want to threaten you?

1802
01:08:58.805 --> 01:09:00.348
You're his best friend.

1803
01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:02.058
Well. that
may have been true once.

1804
01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:03.768
but not anymore.

1805
01:09:03.810 --> 01:09:05.854
That's what happens
when you commit crimes together.

1806
01:09:05.895 --> 01:09:06.938
What?

1807
01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:09.107
What crimes?

1808
01:09:09.149 --> 01:09:10.608
Well. first.

1809
01:09:10.650 --> 01:09:12.819
Matt and Carson stole the idea
for Giggoblog

1810
01:09:12.861 --> 01:09:14.029
from Brody Kresser's father.

1811
01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:15.989
No. No.

1812
01:09:16.031 --> 01:09:17.949
Giggoblog was Matt's idea.
and mine.

1813
01:09:17.991 --> 01:09:19.242
We came up with it.

1814
01:09:19.284 --> 01:09:21.411
But John Kresser
wrote the code for it.

1815
01:09:22.829 --> 01:09:24.456
Okay. yeah.

1816
01:09:24.497 --> 01:09:27.042
Matt's first pass
at writing the code

1817
01:09:27.083 --> 01:09:28.001
didn't work well.

1818
01:09:28.043 --> 01:09:29.627
John revised it.

1819
01:09:29.669 --> 01:09:30.628
added a few things.

1820
01:09:30.670 --> 01:09:32.714
but then he got greedy.

1821
01:09:32.756 --> 01:09:34.591
Demanded half a stake
in the company.

1822
01:09:34.632 --> 01:09:36.968
when I was the one
who wrote the business plan.

1823
01:09:37.010 --> 01:09:38.303
found the investors.

1824
01:09:38.345 --> 01:09:39.971
We did months of work.

1825
01:09:40.013 --> 01:09:42.557
He writes code for a week
and wants half?

1826
01:09:42.599 --> 01:09:44.517
No...

1827
01:09:44.559 --> 01:09:45.935
No way.

1828
01:09:45.977 --> 01:09:47.437
[Roe] Is that really
what you believe?

1829
01:09:48.897 --> 01:09:50.523
This is a draft of the lawsuit

1830
01:09:50.565 --> 01:09:51.983
that John Kresser
was going to file

1831
01:09:52.025 --> 01:09:53.818
against Giggoblog.

1832
01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:55.320
He did expect a 50% share.

1833
01:09:55.362 --> 01:09:56.654
He was promised it

1834
01:09:56.696 --> 01:09:59.324
when he did more than 90%
of the platform's code.

1835
01:09:59.366 --> 01:10:00.200
There's a list
of exhibits in here

1836
01:10:00.241 --> 01:10:01.659
that support his claim.

1837
01:10:01.701 --> 01:10:02.827
Is this true?

1838
01:10:02.869 --> 01:10:04.996
Did you and Matt
steal someone else's work?

1839
01:10:05.038 --> 01:10:07.040
There's also a copy
of an affidavit

1840
01:10:07.082 --> 01:10:08.458
signed by Fred Haskins

1841
01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:09.584
who claimed
he wrote some of the code.

1842
01:10:09.626 --> 01:10:12.045
but Fred Haskins
doesn't write code.

1843
01:10:12.087 --> 01:10:13.672
He's a licensed plumber.

1844
01:10:13.713 --> 01:10:14.964
currently unemployed.

1845
01:10:15.006 --> 01:10:16.174
Unless. of course.

1846
01:10:16.216 --> 01:10:18.009
you count providing
fake alibis and evidence

1847
01:10:18.051 --> 01:10:19.010
as employment.

1848
01:10:19.052 --> 01:10:20.387
Okay. all right. all right.

1849
01:10:20.428 --> 01:10:22.472
that's enough. Aurora.

1850
01:10:22.514 --> 01:10:24.474
I mean it.

1851
01:10:24.516 --> 01:10:26.601
Either you stop talking

1852
01:10:26.643 --> 01:10:28.395
about stuff
you don't know about. or--

1853
01:10:28.436 --> 01:10:29.688
Or what?

1854
01:10:29.729 --> 01:10:31.564
You're gonna hire Haskins
to run me off the road

1855
01:10:31.606 --> 01:10:33.191
the same way you hired him
to do to John Kresser?

1856
01:10:33.233 --> 01:10:36.277
Roe. what are you saying?

1857
01:10:38.571 --> 01:10:40.907
John was conveniently killed
in a car crash

1858
01:10:40.949 --> 01:10:44.577
three days before this lawsuit
was supposed to be filed.

1859
01:10:44.619 --> 01:10:48.373
and I saw Matt deleting an email
between him and Carson

1860
01:10:48.415 --> 01:10:50.083
saying someone had been paid.

1861
01:10:50.125 --> 01:10:52.711
and wouldn't be asking for more.

1862
01:10:52.752 --> 01:10:55.714
Carson. is that email
on the flash drive you want?

1863
01:10:55.755 --> 01:10:57.966
The proof that you and Matt
paid to have someone killed?

1864
01:11:00.719 --> 01:11:01.511
Sally. call Matt.

1865
01:11:01.553 --> 01:11:03.054
tell him to get himself here

1866
01:11:03.096 --> 01:11:05.223
and hand me that flash drive

1867
01:11:05.265 --> 01:11:06.474
if he ever
wants to see you again.

1868
01:11:11.062 --> 01:11:11.938
Do it now!

1869
01:11:13.064 --> 01:11:14.941
Okay...

1870
01:11:19.404 --> 01:11:23.033
Hey. you know what?
I'll do it.

1871
01:11:28.955 --> 01:11:30.707
Hey. Matt. it's Roe.

1872
01:11:30.749 --> 01:11:34.127
Yeah. I know. just. uh.
listen carefully. okay?

1873
01:11:34.169 --> 01:11:36.296
Carson has taken
Sally and me hostage

1874
01:11:36.338 --> 01:11:37.380
at the Cedarbridge Inn.

1875
01:11:37.422 --> 01:11:39.090
He has a gun.

1876
01:11:39.132 --> 01:11:40.175
He wants the flash drive--

1877
01:11:40.216 --> 01:11:42.844
Tell him no police.

1878
01:11:42.886 --> 01:11:43.928
or Sally dies.

1879
01:11:43.970 --> 01:11:45.930
He heard you.

1880
01:11:45.972 --> 01:11:48.099
He understands.

1881
01:11:48.141 --> 01:11:49.809
Please hurry.

1882
01:11:51.061 --> 01:11:52.312
It's okay. all right?

1883
01:11:52.354 --> 01:11:53.938
Help is on the way.

1884
01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:54.898
Matt's on the way.

1885
01:11:54.939 --> 01:11:56.107
Good.

1886
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:57.442
I'll get my flash drive.

1887
01:11:57.484 --> 01:11:59.778
and I'll be on my way.

1888
01:11:59.819 --> 01:12:00.987
[Roe] You really think

1889
01:12:01.029 --> 01:12:02.322
the police
are just going to let you walk?

1890
01:12:03.323 --> 01:12:05.367
Carson. you paid for a murder.

1891
01:12:05.408 --> 01:12:06.534
Probably two.

1892
01:12:06.576 --> 01:12:08.286
Oh. I did not kill
Brody Kresser.

1893
01:12:08.328 --> 01:12:09.287
No. that...

1894
01:12:09.329 --> 01:12:10.455
that's all Matt.

1895
01:12:10.497 --> 01:12:12.874
That's not true!

1896
01:12:12.916 --> 01:12:14.209
He would never...

1897
01:12:14.250 --> 01:12:16.211
I didn't think
he had it in him either.

1898
01:12:16.252 --> 01:12:17.754
but what do you know.
when push came to shove.

1899
01:12:17.796 --> 01:12:18.963
Matt got it together

1900
01:12:19.005 --> 01:12:23.093
and shoved John's greedy kid
off his balcony.

1901
01:12:26.554 --> 01:12:28.139
[rattling door handle]

1902
01:12:28.181 --> 01:12:30.433
[chuckling] Um... hey. Sally?

1903
01:12:30.475 --> 01:12:31.309
I think somehow the door locked.

1904
01:12:31.351 --> 01:12:33.186
[knocking] Hey. Sally?

1905
01:12:33.228 --> 01:12:35.021
Um... hey. Kara!

1906
01:12:35.063 --> 01:12:36.856
Uh. Sally's fine.

1907
01:12:36.898 --> 01:12:38.858
She's just got. um...

1908
01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:40.402
pre-wedding jitters.

1909
01:12:40.443 --> 01:12:42.821
Um. why don't you go across
to the church.

1910
01:12:42.862 --> 01:12:44.823
and you can be ready to help her
when we get there?

1911
01:12:44.864 --> 01:12:46.199
[Kara] Uh. no. um...

1912
01:12:46.241 --> 01:12:47.492
the bridesmaids aren't
supposed to leave the bride.

1913
01:12:47.534 --> 01:12:51.454
I think I'll just. uh.
I'll just wait out here.

1914
01:12:58.628 --> 01:12:59.587
Carson...

1915
01:13:01.256 --> 01:13:03.008
...you actually believe
Matt killed Brody.

1916
01:13:03.049 --> 01:13:05.593
You're not just saying that
to throw the blame off yourself.

1917
01:13:05.635 --> 01:13:06.928
Well. how could I do it?

1918
01:13:06.970 --> 01:13:09.014
With the combination
on that lock on his door.

1919
01:13:09.055 --> 01:13:10.515
I have no way to get in.

1920
01:13:11.891 --> 01:13:14.894
Him and his stupid system
of changing the combinations...

1921
01:13:14.936 --> 01:13:16.229
Wait. he has a system?

1922
01:13:16.271 --> 01:13:17.522
Based on what?

1923
01:13:17.564 --> 01:13:18.815
Stuff from before we met.

1924
01:13:18.857 --> 01:13:20.108
Childhood pets.

1925
01:13:20.150 --> 01:13:22.193
dogs. cats. lizards. whatever...

1926
01:13:22.235 --> 01:13:23.570
The point is

1927
01:13:23.611 --> 01:13:25.864
we all know
Kresser was hit on the head

1928
01:13:25.905 --> 01:13:28.283
inside the condo. hmm?

1929
01:13:28.324 --> 01:13:31.453
And Matt is the only person
who can get in.

1930
01:13:31.494 --> 01:13:33.788
so put two and two together.

1931
01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:35.040
He did it.

1932
01:13:35.081 --> 01:13:36.916
No. Matt is a gentle soul!

1933
01:13:38.835 --> 01:13:40.503
Love is blind.

1934
01:13:40.545 --> 01:13:42.464
Speaking of. where is Matt?

1935
01:13:43.423 --> 01:13:45.008
Huh? Where is he?

1936
01:13:46.926 --> 01:13:47.761
Call him again.

1937
01:13:49.429 --> 01:13:50.221
I need to talk to him
this time.

1938
01:13:50.263 --> 01:13:53.391
Sally. no.

1939
01:13:53.433 --> 01:13:55.810
Trust me. okay?

1940
01:14:00.690 --> 01:14:02.901
-Hey!
-Kara. where's Sally?

1941
01:14:02.942 --> 01:14:04.110
In there.

1942
01:14:04.152 --> 01:14:05.528
-Back up. back up.
-What's going on. Matt?

1943
01:14:05.570 --> 01:14:06.363
[knocking urgently]
Sally. hey!

1944
01:14:06.404 --> 01:14:07.322
Hey. it's me.

1945
01:14:07.364 --> 01:14:08.698
Matt. be careful!

1946
01:14:12.619 --> 01:14:13.703
We're gonna go out that door...

1947
01:14:15.872 --> 01:14:17.916
...and he's going to hand me
the flash drive.

1948
01:14:17.957 --> 01:14:20.627
You hear that. Matty?

1949
01:14:20.669 --> 01:14:21.836
Yeah.

1950
01:14:21.878 --> 01:14:22.796
Yeah. I heard you.

1951
01:14:22.837 --> 01:14:23.963
I have the drive.

1952
01:14:26.341 --> 01:14:27.801
[Carson] Open the door.

1953
01:14:31.346 --> 01:14:32.639
Sally. it's going to be okay.

1954
01:14:34.391 --> 01:14:35.600
Carson. come on.
she has nothing to do with this.

1955
01:14:36.643 --> 01:14:39.187
Give me the drive.

1956
01:14:39.229 --> 01:14:42.065
Sorry. Sally.

1957
01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:45.443
[sobbing]

1958
01:14:45.485 --> 01:14:48.488
[Carson] Now...

1959
01:14:48.530 --> 01:14:49.280
you're gonna let me
through the front door.

1960
01:14:49.322 --> 01:14:50.448
so I can get outta here.

1961
01:14:50.490 --> 01:14:53.410
then you can have
your little wedding.

1962
01:14:53.451 --> 01:14:54.244
Carson. whatever it is
you're trying to do.

1963
01:14:54.285 --> 01:14:55.286
you need to stop--

1964
01:14:55.328 --> 01:14:57.288
Stop talking. Kara!

1965
01:14:57.330 --> 01:14:58.456
Stop it right now.

1966
01:14:58.498 --> 01:14:59.791
Hey. hey. hey. look.
Look at me.

1967
01:14:59.833 --> 01:15:03.211
I should have never
made the drive. okay?

1968
01:15:03.253 --> 01:15:04.462
When Haskins called me.

1969
01:15:04.504 --> 01:15:05.964
he said that you had
already contacted him.

1970
01:15:06.006 --> 01:15:07.048
How was I supposed to know
I wasn't next?

1971
01:15:07.090 --> 01:15:10.343
Shut up
and let me get out of here!

1972
01:15:10.385 --> 01:15:11.761
Drop it. Carson!
Let her go.

1973
01:15:11.803 --> 01:15:13.179
Hey. come here. come here.

1974
01:15:13.221 --> 01:15:15.390
You're okay. you're okay.
you're okay. you're okay...

1975
01:15:15.432 --> 01:15:16.516
[sobbing]

1976
01:15:19.519 --> 01:15:20.979
Anything you say

1977
01:15:21.021 --> 01:15:23.231
can and will be used against you
in a court of law.

1978
01:15:23.273 --> 01:15:24.482
You have the right
to an attorney.

1979
01:15:24.524 --> 01:15:25.483
If you choose not to have one.

1980
01:15:25.525 --> 01:15:27.277
one will be appointed to you.

1981
01:15:27.318 --> 01:15:28.695
[Arthur] Nice ruse.

1982
01:15:28.737 --> 01:15:30.113
calling me when he thought
you were calling Matt.

1983
01:15:30.155 --> 01:15:32.407
This reminds me of the end
of that true-crime book

1984
01:15:32.449 --> 01:15:33.783
you gave me on the Evans' case.

1985
01:15:33.825 --> 01:15:35.785
The wrong guy arrested.

1986
01:15:35.827 --> 01:15:37.037
and it was a whole year

1987
01:15:37.078 --> 01:15:38.288
before the new detective
on the case realized

1988
01:15:38.329 --> 01:15:40.331
the pieces didn't add up.

1989
01:15:40.373 --> 01:15:41.958
The floor
where the murder happened

1990
01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.044
was locked tight.

1991
01:15:45.879 --> 01:15:47.756
Do you remember
how the detective figured out

1992
01:15:47.797 --> 01:15:49.591
who the real killer had to be?

1993
01:15:49.632 --> 01:15:50.633
He realized the janitor
was only the one

1994
01:15:50.675 --> 01:15:51.718
with the keys to that floor.

1995
01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:52.719
Exactly.

1996
01:15:52.761 --> 01:15:54.596
The one with the keys did it.

1997
01:15:54.637 --> 01:15:56.056
or in this case.

1998
01:15:56.097 --> 01:15:59.184
the one
with the combinations did it.

1999
01:15:59.225 --> 01:16:02.687
Arthur. I don't think
Carson killed Brody Kresser.

2000
01:16:02.729 --> 01:16:05.106
So it was Matt after all then.

2001
01:16:05.148 --> 01:16:07.859
Maybe. but I don't know.
it doesn't feel right.

2002
01:16:07.901 --> 01:16:08.777
It seems like
we're missing something.

2003
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:15.533
Well. if it wasn't Matt.
Carson or Dawn.

2004
01:16:15.575 --> 01:16:18.495
who killed Brody Kresser?

2005
01:16:18.536 --> 01:16:20.121
[Cook] Smith!

2006
01:16:20.163 --> 01:16:22.123
Get over here.

2007
01:16:34.719 --> 01:16:36.054
[***]

2008
01:16:36.096 --> 01:16:37.555
[Arthur's voice echoing]
Who killed Brody Kresser?

2009
01:16:39.265 --> 01:16:40.642
[Roe's voice echoing]
I don't know.

2010
01:16:40.684 --> 01:16:41.810
it doesn't feel right.

2011
01:16:41.851 --> 01:16:43.478
It seems like
we're missing something.

2012
01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:44.229
[Prof. Lindo's voice echoing]
Tell me the Eighth Principle

2013
01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:45.438
of Information Science.

2014
01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:47.440
[Roe] No information
stands alone.

2015
01:16:47.482 --> 01:16:51.861
All information exists
in the context of...

2016
01:16:54.406 --> 01:16:57.409
...existing relationships.

2017
01:17:06.042 --> 01:17:07.085
Kara!

2018
01:17:07.127 --> 01:17:09.170
Kara. what are you doing?

2019
01:17:09.212 --> 01:17:10.547
Matt told the police
it was Carson.

2020
01:17:10.588 --> 01:17:12.674
and Carson's going to tell
the police it was Matt.

2021
01:17:12.716 --> 01:17:13.508
It was not Matt.

2022
01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:14.634
No. it wasn't.

2023
01:17:14.676 --> 01:17:16.469
It was you.

2024
01:17:17.387 --> 01:17:18.513
The night of the party.

2025
01:17:18.555 --> 01:17:20.348
you were concerned about Matt.

2026
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:22.017
You went to his condo
to wait for him to come home.

2027
01:17:22.058 --> 01:17:23.184
but he didn't.

2028
01:17:23.226 --> 01:17:25.562
Instead.
an angry Brody Kresser did.

2029
01:17:25.603 --> 01:17:26.896
and he found you.

2030
01:17:26.938 --> 01:17:28.648
Matt's protective older sister.

2031
01:17:28.690 --> 01:17:30.191
and the only other person
in the world

2032
01:17:30.233 --> 01:17:31.776
who knows the names
of the childhood pets

2033
01:17:31.818 --> 01:17:33.111
that Matt uses
to reset the combination lock

2034
01:17:33.153 --> 01:17:34.154
on his door.

2035
01:17:34.195 --> 01:17:35.947
Kara. look around.

2036
01:17:35.989 --> 01:17:37.991
You can't run from this.

2037
01:17:40.535 --> 01:17:43.038
He was threatening
to ruin Matt's life.

2038
01:17:43.079 --> 01:17:44.622
So you hit him on the head
with a vase.

2039
01:17:44.664 --> 01:17:45.915
but it didn't knock him out.
did it?

2040
01:17:47.167 --> 01:17:49.210
He chased you onto the balcony.

2041
01:17:49.252 --> 01:17:51.671
and somehow. you managed
to push him over the edge.

2042
01:17:51.713 --> 01:17:54.215
You picked up the pieces
and locked the door behind you.

2043
01:17:54.257 --> 01:17:56.259
My mom made me swear
on her deathbed

2044
01:17:56.301 --> 01:17:57.761
that I would protect
my little brother.

2045
01:17:57.802 --> 01:17:59.471
and that is the only reason
that I did this.

2046
01:17:59.512 --> 01:18:03.141
How was letting suspicion
fall on Matt protecting him?

2047
01:18:03.183 --> 01:18:04.476
I would never
have let him be arrested.

2048
01:18:04.517 --> 01:18:05.685
There was just
so little evidence.

2049
01:18:05.727 --> 01:18:07.395
I thought this would all
blow over. and...

2050
01:18:10.398 --> 01:18:11.775
I thought he'd marry Sally.

2051
01:18:11.816 --> 01:18:13.568
and then... [crying]

2052
01:18:13.610 --> 01:18:16.571
he'd finally get the family
that he deserved.

2053
01:18:16.613 --> 01:18:18.198
She's gonna leave him
after all this.

2054
01:18:18.239 --> 01:18:19.407
It's all ruined.

2055
01:18:19.449 --> 01:18:21.409
I ruined everything.

2056

2058
01:18:46.643 --> 01:18:49.521
Hey...

2059
01:18:51.815 --> 01:18:53.024
Would you think I'm crazy

2060
01:18:53.066 --> 01:18:54.734
if I said I still
wanted to get married today?

2061
01:18:54.776 --> 01:18:55.902
[chuckling]

2062
01:18:55.944 --> 01:18:57.445
I still have the tux.

2063
01:18:58.738 --> 01:19:03.076
Look. whatever
Carson told you I did.

2064
01:19:03.118 --> 01:19:04.369
it was all him.

2065
01:19:04.411 --> 01:19:07.205
I didn't do anything wrong.

2066
01:19:07.247 --> 01:19:09.207
except stay quiet.

2067
01:19:09.249 --> 01:19:10.458
[sighs]

2068
01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:12.711
But I am not that man anymore.

2069
01:19:12.752 --> 01:19:14.295
You...

2070
01:19:14.337 --> 01:19:17.132
you made me a better person.

2071
01:19:17.173 --> 01:19:19.300
So please. just...

2072
01:19:19.342 --> 01:19:21.344
just give me one more chance.

2073
01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:28.018
Matt...

2074
01:19:28.059 --> 01:19:29.602
my faith in you
stretched farther

2075
01:19:29.644 --> 01:19:33.606
than I ever could've imagined.

2076
01:19:33.648 --> 01:19:35.525
but...

2077
01:19:35.567 --> 01:19:38.445
it won't stretch any more.

2078
01:19:44.868 --> 01:19:45.702
I'm sorry.

2079
01:19:48.079 --> 01:19:49.497
[police officer] Well. I guess
take her into custody

2080
01:19:49.539 --> 01:19:51.041
and then we'll see what happens.

2081
01:19:52.876 --> 01:19:54.627
I'm going to have to take her
to the station.

2082
01:20:01.384 --> 01:20:02.886
What's going on?

2083
01:20:04.346 --> 01:20:07.015
I'm sorry.

2084
01:20:07.057 --> 01:20:08.016
It was Kara.

2085
01:20:09.976 --> 01:20:11.061
[Matt calling] Kara!

2086
01:20:11.102 --> 01:20:12.437
No.

2087
01:20:20.987 --> 01:20:22.197
[chuckling ruefully]

2088
01:20:22.238 --> 01:20:23.740
I'm not getting married
today. Roe.

2089
01:20:23.782 --> 01:20:25.575
I know.

2090
01:20:28.912 --> 01:20:30.830
But hey.

2091
01:20:30.872 --> 01:20:33.291
you won't have a sister-in-law
who's a murderer.

2092
01:20:33.333 --> 01:20:34.376
Too soon?

2093
01:20:34.417 --> 01:20:35.418
Okay. sorry.

2094
01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:36.544

01:20:41.383 --> 01:20:42.801
My thesis topic.

2098
01:20:42.842 --> 01:20:44.010
Hmm...

2099
01:20:44.052 --> 01:20:46.304
"How the Knowledge
of True-crime Literature

2101
01:20:48.431 --> 01:20:50.225
Huh. okay.

2102
01:20:50.266 --> 01:20:51.893
Well. you got my attention.

2103
01:20:51.935 --> 01:20:53.144
Now come sit down

2104
01:20:53.186 --> 01:20:54.437
and take me through
your approach.

2105
01:20:54.479 --> 01:20:55.689
Okay. so here's
what I'm thinking...

2106
01:20:59.651 --> 01:21:01.569
I'm glad you learned to listen
to your instincts. Sally.

2107
01:21:01.611 --> 01:21:03.488
Better a bad announcement.
than a bad marriage.

2108
01:21:03.530 --> 01:21:04.989
Thank you. Aida.

2109
01:21:05.031 --> 01:21:06.408
I'm going to go call

2110
01:21:06.449 --> 01:21:08.201
a potential
new real-estate client.

2111
01:21:08.243 --> 01:21:09.411
see if
she'll list her house with me.

2112
01:21:09.452 --> 01:21:12.205
I've heard
she's very particular.

2113
01:21:12.247 --> 01:21:14.833
Then you will be
her ideal agent. Mother.

2114
01:21:14.874 --> 01:21:16.501
Aw...

2115
01:21:16.543 --> 01:21:18.169
How lucky am I to have
such a cheerleader?

2116
01:21:18.211 --> 01:21:19.462
You are.

2117
01:21:21.381 --> 01:21:22.132
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

2118
01:21:26.261 --> 01:21:29.222
Daniel said he made this
special for you.

2119
01:21:29.264 --> 01:21:31.099
That will go a long way

2120
01:21:31.141 --> 01:21:32.892
in curing what ails me.

2121
01:21:32.934 --> 01:21:36.062
and so will never. ever
mentioning Matt's name again.

2122
01:21:37.647 --> 01:21:39.441
I cannot believe
I was hours away

2123
01:21:39.482 --> 01:21:41.776
from marrying a criminal.

2124
01:21:41.818 --> 01:21:43.653
Promise me it will never. ever.
ever come up.

2125
01:21:43.695 --> 01:21:44.612
Promise.

2126
01:21:46.281 --> 01:21:47.073
I promise.

2127
01:21:48.158 --> 01:21:49.117
You promise.

2128
01:21:49.159 --> 01:21:50.035
Oh. be right back.

2129
01:21:50.076 --> 01:21:51.119
Hey.

2130
01:21:51.161 --> 01:21:52.120
-Hey.
-Arthur.

2131
01:21:52.162 --> 01:21:53.455
Any news?

2132
01:21:53.496 --> 01:21:55.331
Well. charges have been filed
against Kara

2133
01:21:55.373 --> 01:21:56.958
for the murder of Brody Kresser.

2134
01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.711
and both Matt and Carson
have agreed to plead guilty

2135
01:21:59.753 --> 01:22:01.713
to conspiracy
to murder his father.

2136
01:22:01.755 --> 01:22:02.964
Thought I'd let Sally know.

2137
01:22:03.006 --> 01:22:05.175
Ooh. um.

2138
01:22:05.216 --> 01:22:07.218
she actually
just made me promise

2139
01:22:07.260 --> 01:22:10.347
that we would never bring up
Matt's name. like. ever again.

2140
01:22:10.388 --> 01:22:12.182
so maybe
she doesn't want to know.

2141
01:22:12.223 --> 01:22:13.600
Yeah. fair.

2142
01:22:13.641 --> 01:22:14.601
Oh. I almost forgot.

2143
01:22:21.316 --> 01:22:23.151
Thank you for the loan.

2144
01:22:23.193 --> 01:22:24.778
Of course.

2145
01:22:25.862 --> 01:22:27.405
So...

2146
01:22:27.447 --> 01:22:29.532
you and the cook.

2147
01:22:29.574 --> 01:22:30.575
you guys. uh...

2148
01:22:30.617 --> 01:22:32.911
dating. or...?

2149
01:22:32.952 --> 01:22:35.538
I mean. I wouldn't say
we're dating.

2150
01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:37.207
I mean. we're going
on a date tonight.

2151
01:22:37.248 --> 01:22:39.501
Although. um...

2152
01:22:39.542 --> 01:22:43.546
he has this crazy idea
that you want to date me?

2153
01:22:45.799 --> 01:22:47.676
Oh. uh...

2154
01:22:47.717 --> 01:22:49.636
I mean. for as long
as we've been friends?

2155
01:22:49.678 --> 01:22:51.429
How weird would that be?

2156
01:22:51.471 --> 01:22:53.765
[laughing awkwardly]
Yeah. so weird.

2157
01:22:53.807 --> 01:22:54.724
Yeah...

2158
01:22:54.766 --> 01:22:56.685
Yeah.

2159
01:22:58.478 --> 01:23:00.897
Anyways. I should. uh.
say a quick hi to Sally.

2160
01:23:11.908 --> 01:23:13.660
Ah. I think I'm okay...

2161
01:23:13.702 --> 01:23:15.078
All right. scoot in.

2162
01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:17.497
It's my break.
and I always read on my break--

2163
01:23:17.539 --> 01:23:18.540
Wait. wait. wait. wait. wait.

2164
01:23:18.581 --> 01:23:20.625
-We said no more true crime!
-What!

2165
01:23:20.667 --> 01:23:21.543
I did not agree to that.

2166
01:23:21.584 --> 01:23:22.544
What's this one about?

2167
01:23:22.585 --> 01:23:23.837
After everything
that's happened?

2168
01:23:23.878 --> 01:23:24.754
Oh. it's so good. Arthur.
you're going to love it.

2169
01:23:24.796 --> 01:23:26.548
Okay. so this woman.

2170
01:23:26.589 --> 01:23:28.216
she goes missing
in Portland. Oregon.

2171
01:23:28.258 --> 01:23:30.885
she's found in Washington State
a month later.

2172
01:23:30.927 --> 01:23:32.512
It's this crazy journey
of how she got there...

2173
01:23:32.554 --> 01:23:34.097
[***]

2174
01:23:38.226 --> 01:23:42.105
[***]
