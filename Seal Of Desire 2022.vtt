00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.766
<i>Life. extraordinary.</i>

4
00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:10.144
<i>people.</i>

5
00:01:11.345 --> 00:01:14.841
<i>I can't say why</i>

6
00:01:14.876 --> 00:01:17.613
<i>people fascinate me</i>
<i>so much.</i>

7
00:01:18.847 --> 00:01:20.385
<i>If I had to give a reason.</i>

8
00:01:21.784 --> 00:01:23.454
<i>it's because</i>

9
00:01:23.489 --> 00:01:25.852
<i>we're so different.</i>

10
00:01:25.887 --> 00:01:28.822
<i>each and every one of us.</i>

11
00:01:31.728 --> 00:01:33.365
<i>Isn't it amazing to know</i>

12
00:01:34.632 --> 00:01:36.335
<i>there's not another version</i>
<i>of you?</i>

13
00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:39.030
<i>There was only you.</i>

14
00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:45.410
<i>That's what's fascinating.</i>

15
00:01:47.744 --> 00:01:50.041
<i>especially women.</i>

16
00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:58.654
<i>What do these images</i>
<i>remind you of?</i>

17
00:02:03.694 --> 00:02:05.958
<i>Women.</i>

18
00:02:05.993 --> 00:02:09.533
<i>So complex. but so perfect.</i>

19
00:02:11.537 --> 00:02:14.505
<i>To understand them is like</i>
<i>trying to understand income tax.</i>

20
00:02:16.168 --> 00:02:17.871
<i>Exactly.</i>

21
00:02:17.906 --> 00:02:21.072
<i>No one gets it. but I do.</i>

22
00:02:22.207 --> 00:02:24.174
<i>Not income tax.</i>

23
00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.385
<i>women.</i>

24
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.585
<i>Her. for example.</i>

25
00:02:29.885 --> 00:02:32.116
<i>Just look at her.</i>

26
00:02:35.264 --> 00:02:37.198
<i>Look how perfect she is.</i>

27
00:02:38.894 --> 00:02:40.927
<i>It's like</i>
<i>she was designed by Apple.</i>

28
00:02:42.535 --> 00:02:45.965
<i>Is she happy with him</i>
<i>in this moment?</i>

29
00:02:50.202 --> 00:02:53.478
<i>She's smiling.</i>
<i>but looking closely.</i>

30
00:02:54.613 --> 00:02:57.108
<i>her eyes.</i>

31
00:02:57.143 --> 00:02:58.780
<i>there's uncertainty.</i>

32
00:03:00.146 --> 00:03:01.651
<i>She doesn't fully trust him.</i>

33
00:03:03.248 --> 00:03:05.721
<i>Every time he speaks.</i>
<i>she lifts her head</i>

34
00:03:05.756 --> 00:03:07.085
<i>and squints her eyes.</i>

35
00:03:08.495 --> 00:03:10.528
<i>This could also mean</i>
<i>she's intrigued by him.</i>

36
00:03:10.563 --> 00:03:12.827
<i>but it's not the case here.</i>

37
00:03:14.468 --> 00:03:17.062
<i>This woman. for example.</i>

38
00:03:17.097 --> 00:03:19.504
<i>this is what intrigue</i>
<i>looks like.</i>

39
00:03:21.475 --> 00:03:23.574
<i>The difference is that</i>
<i>after she raises her head</i>

40
00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.807
<i>and squints her eyes.</i>

41
00:03:25.842 --> 00:03:28.073
<i>there's a slight adjustment</i>
<i>to her head.</i>

42
00:03:28.108 --> 00:03:30.977
<i>She brings it back down</i>
<i>only a little bit.</i>

43
00:03:32.277 --> 00:03:33.782
<i>This.</i>

44
00:03:33.817 --> 00:03:35.718
<i>This tells us</i>
<i>she's not only intrigued.</i>

45
00:03:35.753 --> 00:03:37.786
<i>but wants something.</i>

46
00:03:38.954 --> 00:03:40.954
<i>What does she want?</i>

47
00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:42.956
<i>With silence.</i>

48
00:03:42.991 --> 00:03:44.925
<i>I get answers.</i>

49
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.598
<i>Silence says many things</i>

50
00:03:47.633 --> 00:03:49.028
<i>without saying anything.</i>

51
00:03:50.262 --> 00:03:52.130
<i>Next comes...</i>

52
00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:54.308
Why are you looking at me
like that?

53
00:03:54.343 --> 00:03:55.474
I'm just looking.

54
00:03:56.642 --> 00:03:57.839
Anything new?

55
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.743
Few things.

56
00:04:00.778 --> 00:04:02.140
Like?

57
00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:03.779
Your perfume.

58
00:04:03.814 --> 00:04:04.912
That's new.

59
00:04:04.947 --> 00:04:06.353
Stop deflecting.

60
00:04:06.388 --> 00:04:07.552
You know what I'm talking
about with you.

61
00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.116
<i>It's all over her face.</i>

62
00:04:11.151 --> 00:04:12.854
<i>She wants me.</i>

63
00:04:14.462 --> 00:04:15.626
<i>and she's looking forward</i>
<i>to the day</i>

64
00:04:15.661 --> 00:04:17.023
<i>when it finally happens.</i>

65
00:04:19.566 --> 00:04:20.895
<i>But I want something else.</i>

66
00:04:24.802 --> 00:04:26.098
You know what?

67
00:04:26.133 --> 00:04:27.473
I'm. uh.
I'm getting a little tired.

68
00:04:27.508 --> 00:04:29.167
I think
I'm gonna call it a night.

69
00:04:29.202 --> 00:04:30.707
- Okay.
I'll walk you out.

70
00:04:30.742 --> 00:04:32.170
No. no. no. I'm good.

71
00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:33.347
Thank you.

72
00:04:33.382 --> 00:04:34.480
Have a good night.

73
00:04:34.515 --> 00:04:35.745
You. too.

74
00:04:37.716 --> 00:04:39.881
- ...wine. champagne
or whatever you want.

75
00:04:41.753 --> 00:04:43.181
<i>There are people</i>
<i>in this world</i>

76
00:04:43.216 --> 00:04:45.216
<i>who ignore</i>
<i>their natural instincts.</i>

77
00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:49.396
<i>our instincts of wanting more.</i>

78
00:04:51.158 --> 00:04:53.158
<i>In Las Vegas.</i>
<i>people tend to let go</i>

79
00:04:53.193 --> 00:04:56.403
<i>and live almost carefree.</i>

80
00:04:56.438 --> 00:04:58.867
<i>which is why I fit in so well.</i>

81
00:05:00.673 --> 00:05:03.003
<i>I can fulfill</i>
<i>my darkest desires.</i>

82
00:05:03.038 --> 00:05:05.841
<i>and no one will even notice.</i>

83
00:05:21.221 --> 00:05:23.254
<i>I promise.</i>
<i>it isn't what it looks like.</i>

84
00:06:20.621 --> 00:06:21.686
<i>Perfect.</i>

85
00:06:33.997 --> 00:06:35.161
Okay. okay. okay.

86
00:06:37.803 --> 00:06:38.967
Come on.

87
00:06:46.042 --> 00:06:47.514
I'm just gonna go
freshen up. okay?

88
00:07:36.191 --> 00:07:37.498
<i>Damn!</i>

89
00:07:38.831 --> 00:07:40.193
<i>What was I thinking?</i>

90
00:07:42.703 --> 00:07:44.230
<i>This shouldn't have happened.</i>

91
00:07:48.071 --> 00:07:49.576
<i>Couldn't help myself.</i>

92
00:08:02.921 --> 00:08:04.591
<i>What are you doing?</i>

93
00:08:20.565 --> 00:08:21.740
- Wait.

94
00:08:23.744 --> 00:08:25.172
- What are you doing?

95
00:08:25.207 --> 00:08:27.042
Go away!

96
00:08:27.077 --> 00:08:28.714
I was going to ask you
the same thing.

97
00:08:30.146 --> 00:08:31.475
You don't want to be here.

98
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:34.951
You're right.

99
00:08:34.986 --> 00:08:36.854
I don't.

100
00:08:36.889 --> 00:08:38.086
You should leave.

101
00:08:39.485 --> 00:08:40.825
I think we both should.

102
00:08:44.127 --> 00:08:45.390
Leave or I'll jump.

103
00:08:47.592 --> 00:08:49.493
I'm sure you don't want
to be here anymore than I do.

104
00:08:53.774 --> 00:08:55.103
Don't be so sure.

105
00:08:56.909 --> 00:08:59.437
I'm sure that
wherever you were. you.

106
00:08:59.472 --> 00:09:00.812
uh. you left in a bit of a rush.

107
00:09:00.847 --> 00:09:04.409
You don't have a jacket.
got no purse.

108
00:09:06.985 --> 00:09:08.512
-Why don't we just-
-Don't!

109
00:09:10.791 --> 00:09:11.955
Okay.

110
00:09:13.695 --> 00:09:16.355
All I'm saying is.
you're not alone.

111
00:09:18.194 --> 00:09:20.799
Now that you have
a moment. just...

112
00:09:20.834 --> 00:09:22.295
just think about
what you're doing.

113
00:09:26.972 --> 00:09:28.741
I'm...

114
00:09:28.776 --> 00:09:30.534
I'm sorry about this.
I have to. I have to take this.

115
00:09:31.944 --> 00:09:33.603
Hello.

116
00:09:33.638 --> 00:09:35.308
Hey. Mama.
You okay?

117
00:09:36.784 --> 00:09:38.685
Okay. great. Let me. let me
give you a call back. okay?

118
00:09:40.612 --> 00:09:41.853
Because I'm with a friend
and I.

119
00:09:41.888 --> 00:09:43.052
and I don't want to be rude.

120
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:46.057
With who?

121
00:09:49.126 --> 00:09:50.125
Emma.

122
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.995
Emma.

123
00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:53.832
I'm with Emma. Ma.

124
00:09:55.627 --> 00:09:58.364
No. we actually. uh.
we just met. Listen. I'm...

125
00:09:58.399 --> 00:10:00.003
I'm trying to help her
with something right now.

126
00:10:00.038 --> 00:10:01.400
I'mma give you
a call back. okay?

127
00:10:02.843 --> 00:10:05.041
Okay.
I love you. too.

128
00:10:05.076 --> 00:10:06.174
All right.

129
00:10:07.408 --> 00:10:08.847
I'm sorry about that.

130
00:10:08.882 --> 00:10:10.178
If. if it wasn't my mama.

131
00:10:10.213 --> 00:10:12.015
I wouldn't have picked up
right now.

132
00:10:13.678 --> 00:10:16.118
Um...

133
00:10:16.153 --> 00:10:18.054
Emma. is it possible
that we can maybe

134
00:10:18.089 --> 00:10:19.891
go somewhere and. and talk?

135
00:10:23.325 --> 00:10:25.666
<i>I pay attention to things</i>
<i>most people don't see.</i>

136
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.132
<i>but I see you. Emma.</i>

137
00:10:30.167 --> 00:10:32.398
<i>I treat her place</i>
<i>as if it's my own</i>

138
00:10:32.433 --> 00:10:33.872
<i>to make her more comfortable.</i>

139
00:10:35.106 --> 00:10:37.040
Uh. where's your light?

140
00:10:37.075 --> 00:10:38.745
-Over here.
-Okay.

141
00:10:40.342 --> 00:10:41.407
Leave it.

142
00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:44.817
Okay.

143
00:10:44.852 --> 00:10:46.984
I'mma go grab you
some blankets

144
00:10:47.019 --> 00:10:48.678
or something. okay?

145
00:10:48.713 --> 00:10:51.186
And we can talk about
whatever you want to talk about.

146
00:10:54.961 --> 00:10:56.092
It's okay.

147
00:10:57.623 --> 00:11:00.228
We all go through things. okay?

148
00:11:00.263 --> 00:11:01.328
I've been there.

149
00:11:01.363 --> 00:11:02.428
We all have.

150
00:11:10.141 --> 00:11:12.042
<i>I'm not taking</i>
<i>advantage of this woman.</i>

151
00:11:16.378 --> 00:11:17.718
<i>This isn't for me.</i>

152
00:11:22.582 --> 00:11:24.120
<i>This is for her.</i>

153
00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.588
<i>Believe it or not.</i>
<i>she needs this.</i>

154
00:11:33.593 --> 00:11:34.801
<i>She's broken.</i>

155
00:11:39.104 --> 00:11:41.005
<i>And I'm her temporary fix.</i>

156
00:11:45.946 --> 00:11:47.176
<i>just a moment.</i>

157
00:11:51.952 --> 00:11:53.446
<i>a feeling...</i>

158
00:11:57.925 --> 00:11:59.584
<i>she wishes can last forever.</i>

159
00:12:28.351 --> 00:12:31.924
<i>Last night was definitely</i>
<i>an unusual night for me.</i>

160
00:12:31.959 --> 00:12:33.354
<i>But what happened. happened</i>

161
00:12:33.389 --> 00:12:34.718
<i>so I can be there for her.</i>

162
00:12:40.396 --> 00:12:43.804
<i>"Emma. I'm sorry I had to leave.</i>

163
00:12:45.368 --> 00:12:47.808
<i>"You looked so comfortable</i>
<i>and I didn't want to wake you.</i>

164
00:12:49.207 --> 00:12:51.845
<i>"What a night we shared.</i>

165
00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:55.013
<i>"It feels as if it was meant</i>
<i>to be because</i>

166
00:12:55.048 --> 00:12:57.609
<i>"we both needed someone.</i>

167
00:12:57.644 --> 00:12:59.380
<i>"Thank you for being</i>
<i>there for me.</i>

168
00:13:00.988 --> 00:13:02.823
<i>"Stop reading and look</i>
<i>under your pillow.</i>

169
00:13:04.816 --> 00:13:08.653
<i>"Don't think of this as charity</i>
<i>or anything like that.</i>

170
00:13:08.688 --> 00:13:12.525
<i>"Look at it as a thank you</i>
<i>for an experience</i>

171
00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.834
<i>"that was priceless.</i>

172
00:13:15.101 --> 00:13:17.431
<i>"It's not much.</i>
<i>but I hope this helps.</i>

173
00:13:18.907 --> 00:13:20.236
<i>"You take care of yourself."</i>

174
00:13:25.276 --> 00:13:26.880
<i>Money.</i>

175
00:13:26.915 --> 00:13:29.344
<i>the root of all evil.</i>

176
00:13:29.379 --> 00:13:30.741
<i>almost made us loser.</i>

177
00:13:32.085 --> 00:13:34.745
<i>Money is never my go-to.</i>

178
00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.682
<i>but in this case.</i>
<i>it was necessary.</i>

179
00:13:37.717 --> 00:13:40.025
<i>It possibly saved her life.</i>

180
00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.060
<i>I'll never know.</i>

181
00:13:42.095 --> 00:13:43.226
<i>It's best that way.</i>

182
00:13:44.559 --> 00:13:46.658
<i>I live in the moment.</i>

183
00:13:46.693 --> 00:13:48.726
<i>Last night we had a moment.</i>

184
00:13:50.268 --> 00:13:53.698
<i>Now that moment is over.</i>
<i>it's time to move on.</i>

185
00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:14.521
What up. boss?
You in early.

186
00:14:14.556 --> 00:14:16.094
And you're late.

187
00:14:16.129 --> 00:14:17.689
I'm not sure
if you noticed me over

188
00:14:17.724 --> 00:14:18.899
in the lobby. sir.
but I was here before you.

189
00:14:20.496 --> 00:14:22.364
What time do we open?

190
00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:23.794
At- 00.

191
00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:25.136
What time is it now?

192
00:14:26.766 --> 00:14:27.941
- 50.

193
00:14:27.976 --> 00:14:29.206
Who do you work for?

194
00:14:29.241 --> 00:14:30.867
For you. sir.

195
00:14:30.902 --> 00:14:32.077
But I'm not really
understanding these questions.

196
00:14:32.112 --> 00:14:33.243
You work for me?

197
00:14:33.278 --> 00:14:35.707
Is my office in the lobby?

198
00:14:37.414 --> 00:14:40.954
If you're not at your desk
at- 45. you're late.

199
00:14:40.989 --> 00:14:42.384
How are you assisting me

200
00:14:42.419 --> 00:14:43.418
when there's no assistant
for my client

201
00:14:43.453 --> 00:14:44.617
when they come in. Kevin?

202
00:14:47.754 --> 00:14:49.259
I need you to be
more professional here.

203
00:14:51.131 --> 00:14:54.297
You represent me.
so I need you to represent.

204
00:14:55.762 --> 00:14:57.267
Talk to the ladies
on your break.

205
00:14:57.302 --> 00:14:58.631
Matter of fact. give them
a chance to come to you.

206
00:15:00.701 --> 00:15:02.569
But. Joe. did you see shorty?

207
00:15:02.604 --> 00:15:04.109
She was bad as hell.

208
00:15:04.144 --> 00:15:05.440
You can't wait
on a piece of ass like that.

209
00:15:05.475 --> 00:15:07.178
You feel me?
You've seen it.

210
00:15:12.383 --> 00:15:14.680
<i>There's</i>
<i>no re-living moments.</i>

211
00:15:14.715 --> 00:15:18.552
<i>Trust me.</i>
<i>it never turns out well.</i>

212
00:15:31.336 --> 00:15:32.467
- There he is.

213
00:15:33.965 --> 00:15:35.305
Another great night. huh?

214
00:15:36.539 --> 00:15:39.210
I take it you had
another bad one.

215
00:15:39.245 --> 00:15:40.541
Don't want to talk about it.

216
00:15:41.874 --> 00:15:44.941
I just-I don't understand.

217
00:15:44.976 --> 00:15:47.779
You're very handsome
and intelligent. man.

218
00:15:47.814 --> 00:15:49.022
You would think
after all this time.

219
00:15:49.057 --> 00:15:50.188
she'd recognize it.

220
00:15:50.223 --> 00:15:51.420
Yeah. you would think.

221
00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.193
Just give it
another 10 years or so.

222
00:15:55.228 --> 00:15:57.195
I don't have 10 years!

223
00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:00.660
I'm just joking. man.

224
00:16:02.169 --> 00:16:03.333
I have an idea.

225
00:16:04.567 --> 00:16:06.567
I'm not cheating on my wife.

226
00:16:06.602 --> 00:16:08.866
I'm not suggesting you
cheat on your wife.

227
00:16:10.375 --> 00:16:11.440
What?

228
00:16:14.577 --> 00:16:18.315
What I was going
to suggest is. for today.

229
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:21.153
we switch assistants.

230
00:16:21.188 --> 00:16:22.781
help make your day
a little easier.

231
00:16:27.458 --> 00:16:31.196
Malcolm. we've known
each other a long time.

232
00:16:31.231 --> 00:16:33.363
16 strong years.

233
00:16:33.398 --> 00:16:35.167
Yeah.

234
00:16:35.202 --> 00:16:36.894
And you don't think
I wouldn't recognize

235
00:16:36.929 --> 00:16:38.170
when you're trying
to manipulate me?

236
00:16:39.932 --> 00:16:41.404
Kevin is horrible.

237
00:16:41.439 --> 00:16:42.702
-Kevin is not that bad.
-You know what?

238
00:16:44.035 --> 00:16:45.573
You can have Melissa
for the day.

239
00:16:45.608 --> 00:16:47.113
Thank you.

240
00:16:47.148 --> 00:16:49.280
But we get to switch offices
for the week.

241
00:16:49.315 --> 00:16:50.776
-How does that even-
-I didn't think so.

242
00:16:52.549 --> 00:16:54.186
Why do you get
the best office anyway?

243
00:16:54.221 --> 00:16:55.517
We're supposed to be partners.

244
00:16:55.552 --> 00:16:56.617
We are-

245
00:16:57.752 --> 00:16:59.620
We are partners.

246
00:16:59.655 --> 00:17:01.325
I pay more rent than you do.

247
00:17:07.927 --> 00:17:09.795
<i>I remember</i>
<i>when Calvin first got married.</i>

248
00:17:11.997 --> 00:17:15.438
<i>They were happy for a moment.</i>

249
00:17:19.576 --> 00:17:24.150
<i>The thing is.</i>
<i>love doesn't exist.</i>

250
00:17:25.681 --> 00:17:27.285
<i>only lustful moments.</i>

251
00:17:28.783 --> 00:17:30.453
<i>When we have a moment</i>
<i>with someone.</i>

252
00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.985
<i>we try to extend this moment</i>
<i>to last longer than intended.</i>

253
00:17:38.298 --> 00:17:40.023
<i>That's how relationships happen.</i>

254
00:17:43.028 --> 00:17:47.107
<i>And you end up here...</i>
<i>seeking counsel.</i>

255
00:17:54.776 --> 00:17:56.347
- Sir. uh.
your 9 o'clock is here.

256
00:17:56.382 --> 00:17:57.480
Send her in.

257
00:18:00.947 --> 00:18:02.683
Hello. Mr. King.

258
00:18:02.718 --> 00:18:05.620
Elizabeth. I told you.
call me Malcolm.

259
00:18:05.655 --> 00:18:07.358
And I told you to call me Liz.

260
00:18:10.154 --> 00:18:11.527
How you doing?

261
00:18:11.562 --> 00:18:13.529
I'm actually doing good.

262
00:18:13.564 --> 00:18:15.663
Things are good. thanks to you.

263
00:18:15.698 --> 00:18:17.830
-Nice.
-Yeah.

264
00:18:17.865 --> 00:18:19.172
-Take a seat.
-Thanks.

265
00:18:22.969 --> 00:18:26.135
So I finally convinced
my husband to come in.

266
00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:28.137
-Really?
-Yeah.

267
00:18:28.172 --> 00:18:29.347
Wow.
How did you do that?

268
00:18:29.382 --> 00:18:30.975
It wasn't easy.

269
00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:32.680
I bet.

270
00:18:32.715 --> 00:18:34.044
So then he'll be joining us
in your next session?

271
00:18:34.079 --> 00:18:36.189
No. he's actually here now.

272
00:18:36.224 --> 00:18:37.190
Listen. I understand.

273
00:18:37.225 --> 00:18:38.521
I got to go.

274
00:18:38.556 --> 00:18:40.655
Uh-Hey. sorry.
Work.

275
00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:42.657
<i>Work. huh?</i>
<i>That's original.</i>

276
00:18:42.692 --> 00:18:44.230
I had to take it.

277
00:18:44.265 --> 00:18:48.564
Um. Mr. King-Malcolm.
this is my husband. Zach.

278
00:18:48.599 --> 00:18:51.061
You look familiar.
Have we met before?

279
00:18:55.672 --> 00:18:57.210
I'm sure I'd remember.

280
00:18:57.245 --> 00:18:58.409
Of course.

281
00:19:00.039 --> 00:19:02.809
Nice to finally meet you.
Zach. I've heard so much.

282
00:19:02.844 --> 00:19:04.514
I hope not all bad.

283
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:05.713
<i>Of course it is.</i>

284
00:19:05.748 --> 00:19:07.143
Please. take a seat.

285
00:19:07.178 --> 00:19:08.254
Thank you.

286
00:19:12.458 --> 00:19:15.690
So. Zach. I want you
to tell me

287
00:19:15.725 --> 00:19:17.527
what finally made you
decide to come in?

288
00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.332
Well. you just get
right to it. huh?

289
00:19:20.367 --> 00:19:21.564
Well. you are paying
by the hour. so...

290
00:19:22.897 --> 00:19:24.028
Honestly...

291
00:19:26.736 --> 00:19:28.131
I love my wife. Malcolm-

292
00:19:29.233 --> 00:19:30.375
Mr. King.

293
00:19:33.413 --> 00:19:35.941
Mr. King.

294
00:19:35.976 --> 00:19:38.009
I want things to work.

295
00:19:38.044 --> 00:19:39.780
I know my wife feels
very strongly about me

296
00:19:39.815 --> 00:19:41.254
coming in to see you.

297
00:19:41.289 --> 00:19:43.883
And here I am. so...

298
00:19:45.293 --> 00:19:47.293
I understand there's
ups and downs in relationships.

299
00:19:47.328 --> 00:19:49.185
we have them.
everyone has them.

300
00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:50.560
you know. but that's
the whole reason

301
00:19:50.595 --> 00:19:51.462
we got married
in the first place.

302
00:19:51.497 --> 00:19:53.024
We love each other.

303
00:19:53.059 --> 00:19:54.795
You know. I think
there's just about anything-

304
00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:57.897
<i>This is what bothers</i>
<i>me the most about my job.</i>

305
00:19:57.932 --> 00:20:03.408
<i>There's so much hope</i>
<i>in her eyes. the pain she's in.</i>

306
00:20:03.443 --> 00:20:04.772
<i>Just hang in there. Liz.</i>

307
00:20:15.587 --> 00:20:17.950
Melissa.

308
00:20:17.985 --> 00:20:20.260
Is any of these clients
here for us?

309
00:20:21.494 --> 00:20:22.988
If you actually did your job.

310
00:20:23.023 --> 00:20:24.759
you wouldn't have
to ask me that.

311
00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:29.060
Well. the thing is. though.

312
00:20:29.095 --> 00:20:31.370
everybody here looks old
and miserable. I guess not.

313
00:20:37.268 --> 00:20:39.103
Hmm. hmm. hmm. hmm.

314
00:20:41.041 --> 00:20:42.975
What are you staring at?

315
00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:44.284
Staring at you. beautiful.

316
00:20:46.046 --> 00:20:47.287
Well. stop.

317
00:20:48.488 --> 00:20:50.620
Stop?

318
00:20:50.655 --> 00:20:52.325
I think it's time
we stop playing these games

319
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.954
with each other and really say
what's on our minds.

320
00:20:57.662 --> 00:20:59.156
What the fuck
are you talking about?

321
00:20:59.191 --> 00:21:00.300
- Hmm.

322
00:21:01.963 --> 00:21:03.963
No. no. No!

323
00:21:03.998 --> 00:21:05.096
Let him go.

324
00:21:05.131 --> 00:21:06.570
It's about us.

325
00:21:08.332 --> 00:21:09.474
Oh. my God.

326
00:21:11.236 --> 00:21:13.379
Well. that concludes
our session.

327
00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:16.745
I'll walk you guys out.

328
00:21:24.392 --> 00:21:25.622
Thank you.

329
00:21:25.657 --> 00:21:26.656
Thank you.
I'll see you soon.

330
00:21:26.691 --> 00:21:27.756
I'll see you soon.

331
00:21:29.221 --> 00:21:34.631
Like I said. I'm all in.
Mal-Mr. King.

332
00:21:34.666 --> 00:21:37.997
Thank you for being
there for her. for us.

333
00:21:38.032 --> 00:21:39.636
What happened here?

334
00:21:39.671 --> 00:21:41.407
Oh. um. nothing.

335
00:21:41.442 --> 00:21:42.771
-Work stuff.
-Hmm.

336
00:21:45.006 --> 00:21:46.478
Thank you for coming in. Zach.

337
00:21:46.513 --> 00:21:47.644
Yeah.

338
00:21:47.679 --> 00:21:48.744
See you soon.

339
00:21:51.419 --> 00:21:52.847
<i>Zach thinks he has me</i>
<i>convinced</i>

340
00:21:52.882 --> 00:21:54.178
<i>he cares about his marriage.</i>

341
00:21:57.282 --> 00:21:59.051
<i>The only thing</i>
<i>you convinced me</i>

342
00:21:59.086 --> 00:22:00.723
<i>of is that you truly care</i>
<i>about your mistress.</i>

343
00:22:06.027 --> 00:22:07.400
What is this?

344
00:22:25.948 --> 00:22:27.882
<i>You want to convince</i>
<i>your wife enough</i>

345
00:22:27.917 --> 00:22:29.719
<i>so you can continue</i>
<i>to get away with it.</i>

346
00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.428
<i>Too bad your mistress</i>
<i>doesn't feel the same about you.</i>

347
00:23:55.741 --> 00:23:57.037
I've heard about you.

348
00:23:59.844 --> 00:24:01.008
The Messiah.

349
00:24:03.507 --> 00:24:04.682
<i>Who?</i>

350
00:24:15.662 --> 00:24:18.322
So you are the savior of women?

351
00:24:18.357 --> 00:24:19.565
<i>She's not scared.</i>

352
00:24:20.931 --> 00:24:22.997
<i>In fact. she looks</i>
<i>almost happy to see me.</i>

353
00:24:24.495 --> 00:24:26.198
<i>A strange man</i>
<i>in your house with a mask</i>

354
00:24:26.233 --> 00:24:27.672
<i>and you're okay with it?</i>

355
00:24:29.005 --> 00:24:30.070
Nothing to say?

356
00:24:31.678 --> 00:24:33.073
<i>You'll tell me</i>
<i>what I want to know.</i>

357
00:24:36.947 --> 00:24:39.409
No. I think it's beautiful
what you're doing.

358
00:24:41.413 --> 00:24:43.248
showing these women
who they married.

359
00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.194
I've been wanting to meet you.

360
00:24:57.704 --> 00:24:59.033
For the longest.

361
00:24:59.068 --> 00:25:00.771
I wasn't even sure
if you existed.

362
00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:06.436
We share a common interest.

363
00:25:10.981 --> 00:25:12.376
as you already know.

364
00:25:13.951 --> 00:25:15.918
<i>She knows</i>
<i>what she's doing.</i>

365
00:25:15.953 --> 00:25:18.184
<i>talking.</i>
<i>but not saying anything.</i>

366
00:25:18.219 --> 00:25:19.218
Sure?

367
00:25:19.253 --> 00:25:20.516
<i>She's smart.</i>

368
00:25:20.551 --> 00:25:21.627
It's good.

369
00:25:23.488 --> 00:25:24.597
Raincheck.

370
00:25:26.326 --> 00:25:28.293
<i>Why is this woman not scared?</i>

371
00:25:30.165 --> 00:25:31.967
So. how did you find me?

372
00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:34.398
- You?

373
00:25:37.502 --> 00:25:40.580
Wait. you're not here for me?

374
00:25:44.014 --> 00:25:45.046
I thought...

375
00:25:48.656 --> 00:25:50.480
Wow.

376
00:25:50.515 --> 00:25:51.954
- I should leave.

377
00:25:55.091 --> 00:25:56.156
Wait.

378
00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:00.325
Is it only married
women you save?

379
00:26:03.363 --> 00:26:04.703
I guess so.

380
00:26:28.619 --> 00:26:30.553
- So.
how much do you know?

381
00:26:34.966 --> 00:26:36.064
What?

382
00:26:44.877 --> 00:26:46.140
You wanna take pictures...

383
00:26:50.014 --> 00:26:51.079
For the wife?

384
00:26:56.218 --> 00:26:57.415
You deserve it.

385
00:27:00.387 --> 00:27:01.518
But what about me?

386
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:04.928
What do I get?

387
00:27:07.262 --> 00:27:08.701
The heartbroken mistress?

388
00:27:14.038 --> 00:27:17.039
I'll do it for you.

389
00:27:19.879 --> 00:27:21.373
But I want something in return.

390
00:28:36.615 --> 00:28:37.856
It's my sister.

391
00:28:49.529 --> 00:28:50.770
<i>How do you know me?</i>

392
00:28:52.532 --> 00:28:56.336
<i>If you knew my name.</i>
<i>you would have said it.</i>

393
00:28:59.704 --> 00:29:01.671
<i>And why would you think</i>
<i>I was there for you?</i>

394
00:29:05.149 --> 00:29:06.610
<i>It's been over a week.</i>

395
00:29:06.645 --> 00:29:07.886
<i>and I can't get you</i>
<i>out of my mind.</i>

396
00:29:11.617 --> 00:29:15.685
<i>We had a moment.</i>
<i>but that moment has passed.</i>

397
00:29:18.899 --> 00:29:20.129
<i>Move on. Malcolm.</i>

398
00:29:25.499 --> 00:29:29.138
<i>Sometimes.</i>
<i>it's difficult to let go.</i>

399
00:29:33.243 --> 00:29:34.539
<i>So I look at these...</i>

400
00:29:39.711 --> 00:29:41.744
<i>to remind me of what once was.</i>

401
00:31:49.874 --> 00:31:51.016
<i>- You like my hair?</i>

402
00:31:51.051 --> 00:31:52.413
<i>Yeah?</i>

403
00:31:54.054 --> 00:31:55.812
<i>- This is always</i>
<i>the hardest part.</i>

404
00:31:55.847 --> 00:31:57.748
<i>- I appreciate it.</i>

405
00:31:57.783 --> 00:32:00.025
<i>- I had to wait</i>
<i>until she had time to process.</i>

406
00:32:02.623 --> 00:32:04.359
<i>While Zach</i>
<i>was on his business trip</i>

407
00:32:04.394 --> 00:32:06.526
<i>for a few days</i>
<i>it was the perfect time.</i>

408
00:32:08.662 --> 00:32:09.969
<i>I'm sorry. Liz.</i>

409
00:32:11.863 --> 00:32:16.503
<i>Love. the word shouldn't exist.</i>

410
00:32:16.538 --> 00:32:20.408
<i>It should be replaced with pain</i>
<i>because that's how love is.</i>

411
00:32:23.809 --> 00:32:25.017
What's going on. man?

412
00:32:27.318 --> 00:32:28.911
Just don't know
how much longer I can take this.

413
00:32:30.684 --> 00:32:33.751
You know. you say that a lot.
but yet you still do.

414
00:32:35.018 --> 00:32:36.853
I want my family.

415
00:32:36.888 --> 00:32:38.657
After 10 years. marriage.

416
00:32:38.692 --> 00:32:41.462
raising kids
and family vacations. it's...

417
00:32:43.664 --> 00:32:45.301
It's not like
you understand. right?

418
00:32:45.336 --> 00:32:47.006
What do you mean. man?
I get it.

419
00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.833
Sorry. I just...

420
00:32:49.868 --> 00:32:51.307
It's cool.

421
00:32:51.342 --> 00:32:52.440
I just...

422
00:32:54.114 --> 00:32:56.114
wish my wife wanted me.
you know?

423
00:32:57.678 --> 00:32:59.381
Everything I do
is a failed attempt.

424
00:33:06.016 --> 00:33:07.488
What happened?

425
00:33:12.462 --> 00:33:13.560
- Hmm.

426
00:33:14.794 --> 00:33:16.563
So tired.

427
00:33:18.897 --> 00:33:19.896
Goodnight. honey.

428
00:33:19.931 --> 00:33:21.337
Goodnight?

429
00:33:21.372 --> 00:33:22.602
I'm tired.

430
00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:28.773
Mm-mmm.

431
00:33:28.808 --> 00:33:30.511
Hey.

432
00:33:33.153 --> 00:33:34.284
Oh.

433
00:33:37.949 --> 00:33:42.292
Oh. baby. what's wrong?

434
00:33:42.327 --> 00:33:43.689
I'm scared.

435
00:33:43.724 --> 00:33:46.956
Oh. honey.
did you have a bad dream?

436
00:33:46.991 --> 00:33:48.727
You need to sleep
with mommy and daddy?

437
00:33:48.762 --> 00:33:50.729
-Mm-hmm.
-Well. come here.

438
00:33:50.764 --> 00:33:52.401
Come here.

439
00:33:52.436 --> 00:33:53.666
Oh. let's put you up.

440
00:33:55.065 --> 00:33:56.702
-Oh!
-All right.

441
00:33:56.737 --> 00:33:58.539
You want covers?

442
00:33:58.574 --> 00:34:00.607
Oh. that's my girl.

443
00:34:00.642 --> 00:34:02.114
Mmm. is that better?

444
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:03.247
She just went to bed
10 minutes ago.

445
00:34:03.282 --> 00:34:04.479
Shh!

446
00:35:18.885 --> 00:35:20.049
Oh. my God!

447
00:35:20.084 --> 00:35:21.226
Oh!

448
00:35:24.759 --> 00:35:26.154
Why didn't you lock the door?

449
00:35:26.189 --> 00:35:27.529
There's no lock on it.

450
00:35:27.564 --> 00:35:29.201
So you don't do it then?

451
00:35:29.236 --> 00:35:30.730
You don't understand.
it's been like six months.

452
00:35:30.765 --> 00:35:32.303
-Six months. man.
-Yeah.

453
00:35:32.338 --> 00:35:33.865
That's crazy.

454
00:35:35.737 --> 00:35:37.132
-Good morning.
-How'd you sleep?

455
00:35:37.167 --> 00:35:38.375
Really well.

456
00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:39.706
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

457
00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:42.005
Wow.
Man. that's-

458
00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:43.248
Is that for me?

459
00:35:43.283 --> 00:35:44.414
Oh. yeah. you can take this.

460
00:35:44.449 --> 00:35:45.547
Thank you.

461
00:35:48.046 --> 00:35:50.046
I'll. uh.
I'll be in there in a minute.

462
00:35:50.081 --> 00:35:51.223
You better.

463
00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:56.228
Wow.

464
00:35:56.263 --> 00:35:57.361
Six months. huh?

465
00:35:58.925 --> 00:36:00.188
Yeah. that's crazy. man.

466
00:36:00.223 --> 00:36:01.497
I'm sorry about that.

467
00:36:01.532 --> 00:36:03.532
Yeah.

468
00:36:03.567 --> 00:36:04.797
Well. you'll see.

469
00:36:06.273 --> 00:36:07.635
See how it is.
when you get married.

470
00:36:09.441 --> 00:36:10.935
That's the thing.
I'm not-

471
00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:12.376
You're not getting married.
Yeah. I know.

472
00:36:12.411 --> 00:36:13.542
Don't.

473
00:36:17.548 --> 00:36:19.845
Out of all the women
you've been with.

474
00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:21.110
not one you actually care about?

475
00:36:22.982 --> 00:36:24.047
What you mean. man?

476
00:36:24.082 --> 00:36:25.587
I care about all of them.

477
00:36:25.622 --> 00:36:26.819
You know what I mean.

478
00:36:28.427 --> 00:36:31.494
There's actually one woman
I met recently.

479
00:36:34.257 --> 00:36:35.399
She's pretty interesting.

480
00:36:38.096 --> 00:36:40.635
Interesting. you mean.
interesting enough to see again?

481
00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:42.538
Exactly.

482
00:36:42.573 --> 00:36:43.737
Okay.

483
00:36:43.772 --> 00:36:45.101
So why don't you?

484
00:36:45.136 --> 00:36:47.543
Was it just a one-night stand?

485
00:36:47.578 --> 00:36:48.643
Come on. man.

486
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:50.975
You know me.

487
00:36:52.616 --> 00:36:54.715
You know you could
try being normal for once.

488
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:57.586
like. maybe even learn
the name first.

489
00:36:57.621 --> 00:36:59.588
You know. it's not that weird.

490
00:36:59.623 --> 00:37:01.249
Do me a favor. man.
I'm about to take off.

491
00:37:01.284 --> 00:37:03.526
Can you. uh. lock up for me

492
00:37:04.991 --> 00:37:07.156
and then make sure
she's gone before you leave?

493
00:37:07.191 --> 00:37:08.432
-Appreciate you.
-What?

494
00:37:08.467 --> 00:37:10.258
Thanks. man.

495
00:37:10.293 --> 00:37:11.765
In one ear and out the other.

496
00:37:15.474 --> 00:37:16.902
Who am I giving advice?

497
00:37:16.937 --> 00:37:18.035
I can't even get laid
by my own wife.

498
00:37:25.715 --> 00:37:26.846
Oh. shit.

499
00:37:26.881 --> 00:37:28.210
All right. lady. time to go.

500
00:37:31.952 --> 00:37:34.216
<i>I keep coming here</i>
<i>thinking I may run into you.</i>

501
00:37:35.989 --> 00:37:38.924
<i>If I did. what would I even say?</i>

502
00:37:38.959 --> 00:37:40.189
<i>"Remember that night</i>
<i>you found out</i>

503
00:37:40.224 --> 00:37:41.861
<i>"your boyfriend was married?</i>

504
00:37:41.896 --> 00:37:43.368
<i>"I'm the guy you kissed.</i>

505
00:37:43.403 --> 00:37:44.600
<i>"Yeah. you know</i>
<i>the one with the mask."</i>

506
00:37:44.635 --> 00:37:46.404
<i>What is wrong with you. Malcolm?</i>

507
00:37:47.704 --> 00:37:49.770
<i>Why are you even here?</i>

508
00:37:49.805 --> 00:37:51.508
<i>The moment is gone. accept it.</i>

509
00:37:57.483 --> 00:37:58.548
<i>Could this be?</i>

510
00:37:59.683 --> 00:38:00.880
<i>No.</i>

511
00:38:02.147 --> 00:38:04.213
<i>Is that her?</i>

512
00:38:04.248 --> 00:38:05.654
<i>I think...</i>

513
00:38:05.689 --> 00:38:06.886
<i>think it is.</i>

514
00:38:27.073 --> 00:38:28.336
Excuse me. miss.

515
00:38:28.371 --> 00:38:30.041
You need a hand?

516
00:38:30.076 --> 00:38:31.306
-Oh...
<i>-It's not her.</i>

517
00:38:31.341 --> 00:38:32.879
No. thank you.

518
00:38:32.914 --> 00:38:35.684
My husband should be
right down. but thanks.

519
00:38:35.719 --> 00:38:37.389
<i>- Husband?</i>

520
00:38:37.424 --> 00:38:38.984
<i>Do I really come across</i>
<i>like a serial killer?</i>

521
00:38:39.019 --> 00:38:40.249
Are you sure?
I really don't mind.

522
00:38:40.284 --> 00:38:41.822
No. really. I'm okay.

523
00:38:41.857 --> 00:38:42.856
Thank you.

524
00:38:42.891 --> 00:38:44.429
Okay. okay.

525
00:38:44.464 --> 00:38:47.663
<i>Maybe I'll just</i>
<i>knock on the door.</i>

526
00:38:47.698 --> 00:38:49.093
Oh. shit.

527
00:38:50.261 --> 00:38:52.569
Oh. I'm...
I'm so sorry.

528
00:38:52.604 --> 00:38:54.263
You must be Tyler.

529
00:38:54.298 --> 00:38:56.705
And this is your Airbnb.

530
00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:57.838
Please forgive me.

531
00:38:57.873 --> 00:38:59.169
I thought that you were just-

532
00:38:59.204 --> 00:39:00.544
Don't worry about it.
It's okay.

533
00:39:00.579 --> 00:39:01.611
I just wanted to come by
and make sure

534
00:39:01.646 --> 00:39:03.107
you had everything you need.

535
00:39:03.142 --> 00:39:04.174
-That's all.
-Oh. I really appreciate it.

536
00:39:04.209 --> 00:39:05.340
Everything looks lovely.

537
00:39:05.375 --> 00:39:06.946
-Okay.
-Thank you.

538
00:39:06.981 --> 00:39:07.947
-Well. you enjoy your stay.
-Have a great day.

539
00:39:07.982 --> 00:39:09.751
-No problem.
-Thanks.

540
00:39:09.786 --> 00:39:10.851
-Don't forget your-
-Uh.

541
00:39:10.886 --> 00:39:11.951
There you go.

542
00:39:13.284 --> 00:39:14.723
<i>Looks like you got away from me.</i>

543
00:39:15.924 --> 00:39:18.254
<i>Probably for the best.</i>

544
00:39:18.289 --> 00:39:23.600
<i>Maybe I'll see you again.</i>
<i>but maybe I'm not supposed to.</i>

545
00:39:23.635 --> 00:39:26.933
<i>Besides. I have work to do.</i>

546
00:40:04.269 --> 00:40:08.007
<i>Is it wrong or is it right</i>
<i>for the right reasons?</i>

547
00:40:11.375 --> 00:40:14.046
<i>Either way. I could be wrong</i>
<i>for doing the right thing.</i>

548
00:40:16.556 --> 00:40:17.720
- Yeah.

549
00:40:46.476 --> 00:40:47.882
Oh. no!

550
00:40:54.088 --> 00:40:55.384
No!
Please don't!

551
00:40:55.419 --> 00:40:57.529
Please.

552
00:41:50.375 --> 00:41:51.880
- Hi.

553
00:41:51.915 --> 00:41:54.014
Liz. hey.

554
00:41:54.049 --> 00:41:55.114
You okay?

555
00:41:56.381 --> 00:41:58.689
Zach's having an affair.

556
00:41:58.724 --> 00:42:00.625
<i>And now you're here.</i>

557
00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:02.187
Liz. I'm sorry to hear that.

558
00:42:02.222 --> 00:42:03.958
I'm sorry I didn't come earlier.

559
00:42:05.093 --> 00:42:06.763
It's okay.
I totally-

560
00:42:11.165 --> 00:42:13.396
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry about this.

561
00:42:35.321 --> 00:42:36.694
<i>This isn't what it looks like.</i>

562
00:42:39.358 --> 00:42:41.094
<i>I'm lying.</i>

563
00:42:41.129 --> 00:42:42.865
<i>This is exactly</i>
<i>what it looks like.</i>

564
00:42:44.495 --> 00:42:47.100
<i>This is my safe zone.</i>

565
00:42:47.135 --> 00:42:49.608
<i>because this leads</i>
<i>to absolutely nothing.</i>

566
00:42:51.304 --> 00:42:54.778
<i>Just a one-time thing</i>
<i>to ease a broken heart.</i>

567
00:42:56.815 --> 00:42:58.507
<i>I have a thing</i>
<i>for women in pain.</i>

568
00:42:59.818 --> 00:43:02.687
<i>And apparently.</i>
<i>they have a thing for me.</i>

569
00:43:04.856 --> 00:43:07.186
<i>It's obvious why.</i>

570
00:43:07.221 --> 00:43:09.122
<i>I make them feel safe.</i>

571
00:43:10.653 --> 00:43:13.632
<i>They tell me their darkest.</i>
<i>most intimate secrets</i>

572
00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:17.636
<i>because I listen. I'm trusted.</i>

573
00:43:20.168 --> 00:43:23.532
<i>Now they know.</i>
<i>they are living lives</i>

574
00:43:23.567 --> 00:43:24.973
<i>with their cheating spouses.</i>

575
00:43:38.516 --> 00:43:41.825
<i>Listen.</i>
<i>before you react</i>

576
00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:46.225
<i>and do the first thing</i>
<i>that comes to mind. think.</i>

577
00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:48.359
<i>what is the best way</i>
<i>in getting revenge?</i>

578
00:43:49.769 --> 00:43:52.033
<i>What will hurt him the most?</i>

579
00:43:52.068 --> 00:43:54.431
<i>This is what you do.</i>

580
00:43:56.204 --> 00:43:57.676
<i>I'm sorry for your pain.</i>

581
00:43:59.372 --> 00:44:02.076
<i>These files were only</i>
<i>for your eyes</i>

582
00:44:02.111 --> 00:44:06.982
<i>and will be deleted</i>
<i>in three. two. one.</i>

583
00:44:11.923 --> 00:44:13.186
I really messed up.

584
00:44:16.026 --> 00:44:17.762
I wish she'd give me
a second chance.

585
00:44:21.592 --> 00:44:25.198
Every day it hurts

586
00:44:25.233 --> 00:44:28.399
more and more.

587
00:44:29.633 --> 00:44:32.909
and you'd think that in time.

588
00:44:32.944 --> 00:44:36.748
the pain would heal.
but not this pain.

589
00:44:38.147 --> 00:44:40.477
She was the love of my life.
and now she's gone.

590
00:44:41.788 --> 00:44:42.952
She left me.

591
00:44:45.121 --> 00:44:46.318
I would have changed for her.

592
00:44:48.421 --> 00:44:49.728
Whatever she needed.

593
00:44:52.425 --> 00:44:53.622
If she'd just
come back to me.

594
00:44:53.657 --> 00:44:56.394
I could tell her. show her.

595
00:45:09.079 --> 00:45:12.245
It would have been
31 years today.

596
00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:14.478
Today.

597
00:45:14.513 --> 00:45:17.283
And I'm trying. man.

598
00:45:17.318 --> 00:45:20.583
It's just so. so hard.

599
00:45:22.455 --> 00:45:24.257
and I haven't even been
talking to our daughter

600
00:45:24.292 --> 00:45:25.654
since she left us and...

601
00:45:27.427 --> 00:45:30.769
They don't need me. we need her.

602
00:45:34.302 --> 00:45:36.533
There's just nothing left
for me here anymore.

603
00:45:51.682 --> 00:45:56.058
Harold.
Bethany didn't leave you.

604
00:45:57.963 --> 00:45:59.160
She passed away.

605
00:46:00.559 --> 00:46:01.998
Almost four years ago.

606
00:46:04.167 --> 00:46:05.364
She's not coming back.

607
00:46:06.697 --> 00:46:10.006
You don't think...
I know she's dead.

608
00:46:15.046 --> 00:46:16.639
If she could speak to you.

609
00:46:16.674 --> 00:46:18.014
I'm sure she would tell you
to find happiness.

610
00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:20.676
Yeah. she would.

611
00:46:24.319 --> 00:46:26.187
That's why I'm here.

612
00:46:26.222 --> 00:46:27.386
I'm trying.

613
00:46:29.588 --> 00:46:30.829
You're doing great.

614
00:46:33.691 --> 00:46:36.725
<i>- First sessions</i>
<i>are always the worst.</i>

615
00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:39.134
<i>It usually starts</i>
<i>as a competition about</i>

616
00:46:39.169 --> 00:46:41.202
<i>who's right and who's wrong.</i>

617
00:46:41.237 --> 00:46:44.667
<i>or like in this case.</i>
<i>we sit here in complete silence.</i>

618
00:46:44.702 --> 00:46:47.010
Why don't we begin with
what brought you two in today?

619
00:46:55.922 --> 00:46:56.921
He's cheating on me.

620
00:46:56.956 --> 00:46:58.186
No. I'm not.

621
00:46:58.221 --> 00:46:59.891
Yes. you are.
Just admit it.

622
00:46:59.926 --> 00:47:01.321
Why would I cheat on you?

623
00:47:01.356 --> 00:47:02.993
You tell me.
you're the one doing it.

624
00:47:03.028 --> 00:47:04.192
I love you.

625
00:47:04.227 --> 00:47:05.721
Don't touch me.

626
00:47:08.759 --> 00:47:11.826
Hilda. why are you saying
Johnathon is cheating on you?

627
00:47:11.861 --> 00:47:13.465
Because he is.

628
00:47:14.765 --> 00:47:15.830
I understand.

629
00:47:15.865 --> 00:47:18.404
I can just feel it.

630
00:47:18.439 --> 00:47:19.768
It's like a woman's intuition.

631
00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:23.178
Are there any other reasons?

632
00:47:23.213 --> 00:47:24.410
Because...

633
00:47:25.985 --> 00:47:27.512
we're not having sex.

634
00:47:27.547 --> 00:47:29.613
so I know
he's getting it from somewhere.

635
00:47:29.648 --> 00:47:31.549
Every time
I try to make a move.

636
00:47:31.584 --> 00:47:33.716
you turn me down.

637
00:47:33.751 --> 00:47:35.619
-You don't try.
-Well. not anymore.

638
00:47:35.654 --> 00:47:37.225
Why would I continue to try

639
00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:38.754
when all I get are your excuses?

640
00:47:38.789 --> 00:47:39.931
I don't give you excuses.

641
00:47:39.966 --> 00:47:41.460
I'm sorry.

642
00:47:41.495 --> 00:47:42.857
-Your reasons.
-Oh. my God.

643
00:47:42.892 --> 00:47:44.562
And more headaches

644
00:47:44.597 --> 00:47:46.762
and the longest period
of any woman I've ever met.

645
00:47:46.797 --> 00:47:48.269
Oh. don't look like that.
Come on.

646
00:47:48.304 --> 00:47:49.402
This is why we're here.
right. to talk.

647
00:47:49.437 --> 00:47:50.601
So I'm talking.

648
00:47:50.636 --> 00:47:52.339
So what?
You think I'm lying?

649
00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:56.145
Malcolm. is it?

650
00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:57.575
Wow.

651
00:47:57.610 --> 00:47:58.807
You're a doctor.

652
00:47:58.842 --> 00:48:00.215
Tell me. is it. um.

653
00:48:00.250 --> 00:48:02.316
is it possible
for a healthy woman

654
00:48:02.351 --> 00:48:03.647
to have periods that last
an entire month

655
00:48:03.682 --> 00:48:05.319
with maybe one day off?

656
00:48:05.354 --> 00:48:07.222
Ha! Exactly. It's bullshit.

657
00:48:07.257 --> 00:48:08.487
What's bullshit?

658
00:48:08.522 --> 00:48:09.994
You're the one that's lying.

659
00:48:10.029 --> 00:48:11.094
and you're not even man
enough to admit

660
00:48:11.129 --> 00:48:12.095
that you're cheating on me.

661
00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:13.459
And I already know.

662
00:48:13.494 --> 00:48:16.462
I love you too
damn much to cheat.

663
00:48:16.497 --> 00:48:18.629
We'll see.
when I get my envelope

664
00:48:18.664 --> 00:48:20.070
with all of your dirty
little secrets.

665
00:48:20.105 --> 00:48:21.236
<i>- What?</i>

666
00:48:21.271 --> 00:48:23.106
Oh.
Oh. well. you know what?

667
00:48:23.141 --> 00:48:24.569
He only goes after men
who are actually cheating.

668
00:48:24.604 --> 00:48:25.669
so you won't be getting
anything

669
00:48:25.704 --> 00:48:27.440
because I'm not cheating.

670
00:48:27.475 --> 00:48:28.936
<i>-- Wait a minute.</i>
-Well. we'll see about that.

671
00:48:28.971 --> 00:48:31.510
I'm sorry about that.
um. but who is he?

672
00:48:31.545 --> 00:48:33.578
She's talking about some guy

673
00:48:33.613 --> 00:48:35.316
who supposedly leaves
an envelope

674
00:48:35.351 --> 00:48:37.945
on the doorsteps of wives
who are being cheated on.

675
00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:39.320
<i>Damn.</i>

676
00:48:39.355 --> 00:48:40.618
Is this true?

677
00:48:40.653 --> 00:48:42.686
No. it's not.

678
00:48:42.721 --> 00:48:45.128
But she does constantly
use this against me.

679
00:48:45.163 --> 00:48:47.295
So why would these women
make all of this up?

680
00:48:47.330 --> 00:48:49.528
They all have no proof.

681
00:48:49.563 --> 00:48:51.860
Just an envelope
with an empty flash drive.

682
00:48:51.895 --> 00:48:53.466
You want an empty flash drive?

683
00:48:53.501 --> 00:48:54.830
-I'll go down-
-That doesn't even make sense.

684
00:48:54.865 --> 00:48:55.930
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>so it's not just</i>

685
00:48:55.965 --> 00:48:58.471
<i>a friend of theirs that talked.</i>

686
00:48:58.506 --> 00:49:00.011
<i>There must be a source.</i>

687
00:49:00.046 --> 00:49:01.606
<i>I need to get rid of it.</i>

688
00:49:01.641 --> 00:49:02.970
<i>This can come back-</i>

689
00:49:03.005 --> 00:49:03.872
- Malcolm.
what do you think?

690
00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:08.547
Where does your source
come from?

691
00:49:08.582 --> 00:49:10.021
I told you. I just know.

692
00:49:10.056 --> 00:49:11.484
No. no. no. I'm sorry.

693
00:49:11.519 --> 00:49:13.156
not your source
on Johnathon cheating.

694
00:49:13.191 --> 00:49:16.489
but your source on this man
with the envelopes.

695
00:49:16.524 --> 00:49:17.589
Why?

696
00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:22.891
Well. I believe that
your source.

697
00:49:22.926 --> 00:49:25.729
all of these women.
as you put it.

698
00:49:25.764 --> 00:49:28.501
may have you frightened
that you're next.

699
00:49:29.735 --> 00:49:31.570
And if you get together
with these women

700
00:49:31.605 --> 00:49:33.836
on a regular to talk
about these things.

701
00:49:33.871 --> 00:49:35.475
they can make you feel somewhat-

702
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:38.214
I don't know
any of these women personally.

703
00:49:39.448 --> 00:49:41.976
In fact. I don't even know
any of their names.

704
00:49:42.011 --> 00:49:45.023
I follow this blog.
Temporary Forevers.

705
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:54.230
<i>Okay.</i>

706
00:49:54.265 --> 00:49:56.958
<i>Temporary Forevers.</i>

707
00:49:58.764 --> 00:49:59.862
<i>Let's see.</i>

708
00:50:03.868 --> 00:50:05.934
<i>-- I've heard about you.</i>
<i>-- Mmm.</i>

709
00:50:05.969 --> 00:50:07.177
<i>Messiah.</i>

710
00:50:07.212 --> 00:50:09.509
<i>- The Messiah.</i>

711
00:50:09.544 --> 00:50:11.115
- Okay.

712
00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:12.875
<i>- I caught</i>
<i>my husband cheating.</i>

713
00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:14.547
<i>Well. I didn't.</i>

714
00:50:14.582 --> 00:50:16.681
<i>Someone left</i>
<i>an envelope on my doorstep.</i>

715
00:50:16.716 --> 00:50:18.045
<i>- I thought</i>
<i>I was the only one.</i>

716
00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:19.189
<i>- Me too.</i>

717
00:50:19.224 --> 00:50:21.686
<i>I never said anything to anyone.</i>

718
00:50:21.721 --> 00:50:23.721
<i>I thought they would think</i>
<i>I was making it up.</i>

719
00:50:23.756 --> 00:50:27.021
<i>Everything deletes</i>
<i>the moment you watch it.</i>

720
00:50:27.056 --> 00:50:28.231
<i>Happy-</i>

721
00:50:28.266 --> 00:50:30.200
<i>- There you are.</i>

722
00:50:30.235 --> 00:50:32.301
<i>- I got everything</i>
<i>and he got what he deserved-</i>

723
00:50:32.336 --> 00:50:34.930
<i>- So you're the one</i>
<i>making me famous.</i>

724
00:50:36.472 --> 00:50:38.274
<i>Veronica Wilson.</i>

725
00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:40.408
<i>- I just</i>
<i>had a date with the Messiah.</i>

726
00:50:40.443 --> 00:50:41.574
<i>- Oh. my God.</i>
<i>are you serious?</i>

727
00:50:41.609 --> 00:50:42.872
<i>What does he look like?</i>

728
00:50:42.907 --> 00:50:44.379
<i>- I didn't see his face.</i>

729
00:50:44.414 --> 00:50:45.545
<i>- So what did you</i>
<i>have to say</i>

730
00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:46.876
<i>about our little encounter?</i>

731
00:50:46.911 --> 00:50:48.042
<i>You didn't see his face?</i>

732
00:50:48.077 --> 00:50:50.121
<i>- I didn't.</i>

733
00:50:50.156 --> 00:50:51.353
<i>He wears a mask.</i>

734
00:50:52.653 --> 00:50:54.719
<i>I wish I could see him again.</i>

735
00:50:54.754 --> 00:50:56.424
<i>- Hmm.</i>

736
00:50:56.459 --> 00:50:58.195
<i>Maybe it's time we meet again.</i>

737
00:51:16.809 --> 00:51:19.150
I have an appointment
at- 00 with Malcolm.

738
00:51:19.185 --> 00:51:21.416
Okay. Can you just sign it
for me right there. please?

739
00:51:21.451 --> 00:51:22.549
Thank you.

740
00:51:26.951 --> 00:51:28.852
All right. just have a seat.
he'll be with you shortly.

741
00:51:28.887 --> 00:51:29.985
Thank you.

742
00:51:38.633 --> 00:51:40.534
Sir. your 10 o'clock is here.

743
00:51:41.669 --> 00:51:42.800
All right.

744
00:51:58.488 --> 00:52:00.653
Okay. I thought
you weren't coming in today.

745
00:52:00.688 --> 00:52:02.655
I didn't think you cared.

746
00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:03.854
I don't.

747
00:52:03.889 --> 00:52:05.493
Well. I wasn't gonna come in.

748
00:52:05.528 --> 00:52:07.495
but I realized

749
00:52:07.530 --> 00:52:08.892
I didn't want you here
all by yourself.

750
00:52:11.732 --> 00:52:13.600
That's sweet. Kevin.

751
00:52:15.406 --> 00:52:17.571
Not sweeter than lips.
I'm guessing.

752
00:52:17.606 --> 00:52:18.869
Mm-hmm.

753
00:52:21.709 --> 00:52:23.544
Look in the desk.

754
00:52:23.579 --> 00:52:25.348
Why?

755
00:52:25.383 --> 00:52:26.877
Just look in the desk.

756
00:52:28.914 --> 00:52:30.188
Voila.
You like?

757
00:52:31.785 --> 00:52:34.016
Okay. that was pretty good.

758
00:52:34.051 --> 00:52:37.261
Tonight. I want you to wear
nothing but that rose.

759
00:52:40.398 --> 00:52:41.859
You just have to ruin it.

760
00:52:47.064 --> 00:52:49.702
Oh. I see somebody loves you.

761
00:52:49.737 --> 00:52:52.001
I used to get
my Becky flowers all the time.

762
00:52:52.036 --> 00:52:53.574
Thank you. Mr. Moore.

763
00:52:53.609 --> 00:52:55.004
-Calvin will be right with you.
-All right.

764
00:52:55.039 --> 00:52:56.775
Tell him to hurry. would you?
Yeah.

765
00:52:56.810 --> 00:52:58.711
No. I'm just kidding.
I got no place to be.

766
00:53:18.062 --> 00:53:19.798
Looking at that man like you
just want to eat him.

767
00:53:23.738 --> 00:53:26.871
Kevin. you ever realize that.
like.

768
00:53:26.906 --> 00:53:29.577
a woman comes in here
sad and then leaves.

769
00:53:29.612 --> 00:53:32.074
I don't know. not so sad?

770
00:53:33.616 --> 00:53:34.747
All the time.

771
00:53:34.782 --> 00:53:36.078
Man's good at his show.

772
00:53:36.113 --> 00:53:38.652
Look. you ever noticed
every time

773
00:53:38.687 --> 00:53:40.115
I come to work
how happy you are?

774
00:53:42.922 --> 00:53:44.823
That doesn't make sense.

775
00:53:44.858 --> 00:53:46.990
It makes perfect sense.

776
00:53:47.025 --> 00:53:49.091
I'm good at my job.

777
00:53:49.126 --> 00:53:50.334
Oh. my God.

778
00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:05.173
<i>Still nothing.</i>

779
00:54:05.208 --> 00:54:06.647
<i>Why haven't you written back?</i>

780
00:54:25.668 --> 00:54:26.865
Hey.

781
00:54:28.297 --> 00:54:29.373
It's me.

782
00:54:29.408 --> 00:54:30.704
I see.

783
00:54:32.972 --> 00:54:34.642
What's going on?

784
00:54:34.677 --> 00:54:35.874
Came to see you.

785
00:54:38.241 --> 00:54:39.482
So you changed
some things around

786
00:54:39.517 --> 00:54:40.813
since the last time I was here.

787
00:54:43.488 --> 00:54:44.817
Yeah.

788
00:54:44.852 --> 00:54:46.324
Uh. that was almost a year ago.

789
00:54:48.251 --> 00:54:49.558
Has it been that long?

790
00:54:51.496 --> 00:54:52.561
Mm-hmm.

791
00:54:54.356 --> 00:54:56.367
I miss this view.

792
00:54:56.402 --> 00:54:58.061
Yeah. it's. uh. something.

793
00:55:00.736 --> 00:55:02.373
So what...

794
00:55:02.408 --> 00:55:04.067
what brings you by?

795
00:55:04.102 --> 00:55:05.442
Funny you should ask.

796
00:55:07.545 --> 00:55:11.173
Um. I was just at home
thinking about that one time.

797
00:55:12.682 --> 00:55:14.517
Yeah.

798
00:55:14.552 --> 00:55:15.980
Um. do you remember
that conversation

799
00:55:16.015 --> 00:55:18.015
we had the last time
you was here?

800
00:55:20.052 --> 00:55:21.392
It was so long ago.

801
00:55:22.725 --> 00:55:25.253
We agreed that because
we work together.

802
00:55:25.288 --> 00:55:27.761
this is probably
not the best idea.

803
00:55:29.259 --> 00:55:33.261
I think one time a year is fine.

804
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:42.171
<i>She is tempting.</i>

805
00:55:42.206 --> 00:55:43.645
<i>but I'm not going to do</i>
<i>that again.</i>

806
00:55:46.408 --> 00:55:49.948
<i>Um. Melissa. I'm...</i>
<i>I'm sorry. I really...</i>

807
00:55:49.983 --> 00:55:52.082
<i>I have some serious work</i>
<i>I got to get to. I'm...</i>

808
00:55:52.117 --> 00:55:54.887
<i>I'm sorry about this. okay?</i>

809
00:55:54.922 --> 00:55:56.625
Unbelievable.

810
00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:59.221
We work together.

811
00:55:59.256 --> 00:56:00.794
We work together.

812
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:02.224
but it's okay for you
to screw your clients.

813
00:56:02.259 --> 00:56:04.028
- Wait. what?

814
00:56:04.063 --> 00:56:05.469
Look. you don't want to waste
your time worried about

815
00:56:05.504 --> 00:56:07.229
somebody like me. okay?

816
00:56:09.134 --> 00:56:10.639
You're young and beautiful.

817
00:56:12.104 --> 00:56:14.577
And besides. Kevin.
you know. he cares about you.

818
00:56:16.009 --> 00:56:17.514
And I care about you.

819
00:56:20.244 --> 00:56:22.453
Look. I'm not here just for sex.

820
00:56:24.314 --> 00:56:25.621
I just thought
that was the only way

821
00:56:25.656 --> 00:56:26.853
to get your attention.

822
00:56:30.529 --> 00:56:33.189
I'd love to go out
with you on a real date.

823
00:56:37.459 --> 00:56:41.670
But I see you and I know
that's not what you want.

824
00:56:43.707 --> 00:56:45.542
Not just with me.
but with anybody.

825
00:56:48.107 --> 00:56:49.370
Well. you can get back to work.

826
00:56:51.044 --> 00:56:52.340
I'm sorry I came by.

00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:09.665

And that's why
you wanted to meet.

872
01:01:42.632 --> 01:01:43.774
This is an interview?

873
01:01:45.074 --> 01:01:47.701
Good. because I have
some questions

874
01:01:47.736 --> 01:01:49.241
I'm sure the ladies
on my blog

875
01:01:49.276 --> 01:01:50.605
would love to know about. too.

876
01:01:55.315 --> 01:01:57.711

I was hoping
you can take it down.

880
01:02:08.361 --> 01:02:11.934
Oh. I get it.
you want to stay discreet.

881
01:02:13.971 --> 01:02:15.168
Exactly.

882
01:02:15.203 --> 01:02:16.301
No.

883
01:02:18.206 --> 01:02:19.436
No?

884
01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:26.014
Let me explain something.

885
01:02:26.049 --> 01:02:29.743
My blog is an outlet
for women to discuss things.

886
01:02:29.778 --> 01:02:31.822
And you are a big part
of that now.

887
01:02:35.784 --> 01:02:36.926
I shouldn't have come.

888
01:02:36.961 --> 01:02:38.059
Wait.

889
01:02:42.362 --> 01:02:43.625
What would you like to know?

890
01:02:45.563 --> 01:02:49.301
Interview with the Messiah?

891
01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:52.975
First question.

892
01:02:55.474 --> 01:02:56.638
Why?

893
01:02:58.345 --> 01:03:01.643
<i>I can't believe it.</i>
<i>she deleted the Messiah page.</i>

894
01:03:05.517 --> 01:03:06.989
<i>There you are. Johnathon.</i>

895
01:03:09.356 --> 01:03:10.586
<i>And who are you?</i>

896
01:03:14.031 --> 01:03:15.866
<i>Looks like you were right.</i>
<i>Hilda.</i>

897
01:03:20.939 --> 01:03:22.268
<i>And she's pregnant.</i>

898
01:03:23.909 --> 01:03:25.403
<i>A woman's intuition.</i>

899
01:03:27.044 --> 01:03:28.736
<i>Didn't think</i>
<i>that was a real thing.</i>

900
01:03:42.125 --> 01:03:44.092
<i>I can't believe you deleted it.</i>

901
01:03:45.854 --> 01:03:47.755
<i>There's no reason</i>
<i>to see you again.</i>

902
01:03:49.363 --> 01:03:52.265
<i>You did what I wanted. but why?</i>

903
01:03:54.071 --> 01:03:55.796
<i>What was it that made you do it?</i>

904
01:03:57.976 --> 01:04:00.042
<i>Damn!</i>

905
01:04:00.077 --> 01:04:01.802
<i>You are so hard to read.</i>

906
01:04:20.823 --> 01:04:23.758
<i>All right. Johnathon.</i>
<i>where are we?</i>

907
01:05:01.534 --> 01:05:04.766
<i>This is your sister</i>

908
01:05:05.934 --> 01:05:07.208
<i>and her husband.</i>

909
01:05:08.772 --> 01:05:12.543
<i>You want what they have.</i>
<i>a family.</i>

910
01:05:24.689 --> 01:05:26.524
Sorry. I'm late.

911
01:05:26.559 --> 01:05:28.130
Yeah.
I'm surprised.

912
01:05:28.165 --> 01:05:29.626
You're never late.

913
01:05:29.661 --> 01:05:31.430
Things have been
a little upside down lately.

914
01:05:31.465 --> 01:05:33.267
How so?

915
01:05:33.302 --> 01:05:34.961
How you been?

916
01:05:34.996 --> 01:05:37.337
Malcolm. you know that
if you continue to deflect.

917
01:05:37.372 --> 01:05:38.965
your sessions won't count.

918
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.670
- Can I get you
two anything to drink?

919
01:05:40.705 --> 01:05:42.441
Hi. Um. can you
just give us a minute?

920
01:05:42.476 --> 01:05:44.806
-- Yeah. sure.
-Thank you so much.

921
01:05:44.841 --> 01:05:47.446
All right. so.

922
01:05:47.481 --> 01:05:49.052
Really?

923
01:05:49.087 --> 01:05:51.516
Yeah. really.
What's going on?

924
01:05:51.551 --> 01:05:53.485
You know I don't like
you doing that.

925
01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:56.389
You asked me to help.
That's all I'm trying to do.

926
01:05:56.424 --> 01:05:58.457
If my license wasn't
on the line.

927
01:05:58.492 --> 01:06:01.064
we wouldn't be having
these conversations.

928
01:06:01.099 --> 01:06:02.527
We legally have to talk
about this. so...

929
01:06:02.562 --> 01:06:04.529
Yeah. exactly.

930
01:06:04.564 --> 01:06:06.036
So instead of going
to anyone else.

931
01:06:06.071 --> 01:06:07.334
you decided to come to me.

932
01:06:07.369 --> 01:06:08.962
Because you're a friend.

933
01:06:08.997 --> 01:06:10.238
Yeah. but. Malcolm.
that doesn't mean that

934
01:06:10.273 --> 01:06:11.668
I'm not going to do my job.

935
01:06:11.703 --> 01:06:12.999
I like these sessions
to feel more like

936
01:06:13.034 --> 01:06:14.836
conversation. not therapy.

937
01:06:18.248 --> 01:06:19.676
Are you seeing escorts?

938
01:06:21.746 --> 01:06:23.548
Wow. Really?

939
01:06:23.583 --> 01:06:26.551
Doing anything that would be
considered sexually illegal?

940
01:06:26.586 --> 01:06:28.190
Will you keep your voice down?
We're at a restaurant.

941
01:06:28.225 --> 01:06:29.884
Because if you are...

942
01:06:29.919 --> 01:06:31.094
I met somebody.

943
01:06:32.229 --> 01:06:33.624
Oh. okay.

944
01:06:35.958 --> 01:06:37.100
Hmm.

945
01:06:40.798 --> 01:06:42.435
Are you... are you cool.

946
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:43.601
You just...

947
01:06:43.636 --> 01:06:45.273
Oh. no. I'm good.
I'm good.

948
01:06:45.308 --> 01:06:47.110
You just seem
a little jealous. that's all.

949
01:06:47.145 --> 01:06:49.002
No. I'm... I'm just-

950
01:06:49.037 --> 01:06:50.344
I'm not jealous.
I'm just curious.

951
01:06:50.379 --> 01:06:52.511
So tell me about her.

952
01:06:52.546 --> 01:06:54.414
We went on a date

953
01:06:56.044 --> 01:06:57.846
and I haven't heard from her.

954
01:06:57.881 --> 01:07:00.222
But isn't that what you prefer.
to keep things simple.

955
01:07:00.257 --> 01:07:02.224
keep your urges in check?

956
01:07:02.259 --> 01:07:03.918
Yeah. it is.

957
01:07:05.790 --> 01:07:07.625
I just kind of want to see
her again. you know?

958
01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:08.956
So then why don't you call her?

959
01:07:10.135 --> 01:07:11.332
I don't have her number.

960
01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:14.500
Okay. so question. uh.

961
01:07:15.998 --> 01:07:18.867
what is it about her that makes
you want to see her again?

962
01:07:18.902 --> 01:07:20.638
I don't know.

963
01:07:20.673 --> 01:07:22.310
Well. maybe you should
ask yourself why.

964
01:07:27.515 --> 01:07:29.075
Mmm.

965
01:07:29.110 --> 01:07:30.912
Hey. boss.

966
01:07:30.947 --> 01:07:32.650
You gotta try these cupcakes
Melissa made.

967
01:07:32.685 --> 01:07:35.290
Cupcakes. this early?

968
01:07:35.325 --> 01:07:38.326
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah. you should try one.

969
01:07:38.361 --> 01:07:39.921
I thought
you was allergic to chocolate.

970
01:07:39.956 --> 01:07:41.395
Mmm. I am.

971
01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:42.792
It's just food coloring.

972
01:07:42.827 --> 01:07:44.893
No. it isn't.

973
01:07:44.928 --> 01:07:46.169
Stop playing.

974
01:07:46.204 --> 01:07:47.962
Why would I dye
a vanilla cupcake

975
01:07:47.997 --> 01:07:49.502
to look like
a chocolate cupcake?

976
01:08:00.383 --> 01:08:03.109
Um. Melissa. listen.
I'm sorry about-

977
01:08:03.144 --> 01:08:05.353
I'm so sorry.

978
01:08:05.388 --> 01:08:06.684
I don't know
what I was thinking.

979
01:08:08.193 --> 01:08:09.819
I hope I didn't make
you uncomfortable

980
01:08:09.854 --> 01:08:11.161
or anything like that.

981
01:08:11.196 --> 01:08:13.020
No. you didn't.

982
01:08:13.055 --> 01:08:15.627
The last thing I want to do
is ruin our work environment.

983
01:08:15.662 --> 01:08:16.958
Yeah. me too.

984
01:08:18.159 --> 01:08:20.203
I apologize. too.

985
01:08:20.238 --> 01:08:21.699
I should've known better

986
01:08:21.734 --> 01:08:24.636
when we had
our first little encounter.

987
01:08:24.671 --> 01:08:26.275
Mm-hmm.

988
01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:27.705
But I want you to know
I'm a professional.

989
01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:29.003
I take my job very serious.

990
01:08:29.038 --> 01:08:30.213
I don't want you to think I'm-

991
01:08:30.248 --> 01:08:31.379
I know that.

992
01:08:32.844 --> 01:08:34.217
I was just being jealous.

993
01:08:36.045 --> 01:08:37.484
I think you're a great guy.

994
01:08:41.017 --> 01:08:42.324
Um. ignore what I said.

995
01:08:43.921 --> 01:08:45.492
So we good?

996
01:08:45.527 --> 01:08:46.526
Guys. I think
I need to go to the hospital.

997
01:08:46.561 --> 01:08:48.022
-Damn!
-Oh. my God!

998
01:08:54.162 --> 01:08:56.338
He'll be okay.

999
01:08:56.373 --> 01:08:57.438
I'll cover for him.

1000
01:08:59.739 --> 01:09:01.541
Uh. are you sure?

1001
01:09:01.576 --> 01:09:02.905
-I don't want to-
-Yeah.

1002
01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:04.643
Okay...
overwhelm you or anything.

1003
01:09:04.678 --> 01:09:06.139
Not a problem...

1004
01:09:06.174 --> 01:09:07.679
Okay.

1005
01:09:07.714 --> 01:09:08.845
..boss.

1006
01:09:23.301 --> 01:09:25.367
<i>Today is going</i>
<i>to be one of those days.</i>

1007
01:09:39.779 --> 01:09:41.383
<i>What have you been up to?</i>

1008
01:09:43.145 --> 01:09:46.113
<i>Maybe I should</i>
<i>send another message.</i>

1009
01:09:46.148 --> 01:09:50.392
<i>Just to say thank you.</i>
<i>or maybe I should just ask...</i>

1010
01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:53.494
<i>how are you.</i>

1011
01:09:57.995 --> 01:09:59.764
<i>- Malcolm.</i>
<i>your 9 o'clock is here.</i>

1012
01:10:02.769 --> 01:10:04.164
How does that make you feel?

1013
01:10:05.838 --> 01:10:07.277
Angry.

1014
01:10:07.312 --> 01:10:08.740
You want a clean sponge
and dirty dishes?

1015
01:10:08.775 --> 01:10:10.808
My girl is driving me
fucking nuts.

1016
01:10:10.843 --> 01:10:12.579
I don't really
wanna talk about it.

1017
01:10:12.614 --> 01:10:14.075
I don't know what to do anymore.

1018
01:10:14.110 --> 01:10:16.418
You're at home all day
while I'm working.

1019
01:10:16.453 --> 01:10:17.881
Man. it's not even like

1020
01:10:17.916 --> 01:10:20.752
something specific or.
like. her.

1021
01:10:20.787 --> 01:10:24.217
Just...
just every day. bro. with her.

1022
01:10:24.252 --> 01:10:28.562
Without someone being
there to actually

1023
01:10:28.597 --> 01:10:31.598
speak for our people.
then we have no voice.

1024
01:10:31.633 --> 01:10:33.633
We become complacent
like we have now.

1025
01:10:33.668 --> 01:10:36.097
But what about you?

1026
01:10:36.132 --> 01:10:37.637
What about. what about me?

1027
01:10:37.672 --> 01:10:39.232
I'm at home. I'm at the crib.

1028
01:10:39.267 --> 01:10:41.443
You know where
I'm at all the time.

1029
01:10:41.478 --> 01:10:42.840
I need... I need a man.

1030
01:10:42.875 --> 01:10:44.347
Is that. is that what
you're saying?

1031
01:10:44.382 --> 01:10:45.645
I clean up the place.
I put it all back.

1032
01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:47.009
She says nothing.

1033
01:10:47.044 --> 01:10:48.780
-I want this to-
-Nothing's happening.

1034
01:10:48.815 --> 01:10:50.485
I'm not going to stop
playing my game.

1035
01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:51.948
I'm not going to stop
loving you.

1036
01:10:51.983 --> 01:10:53.752
I can't take this shit anymore.

1037
01:10:53.787 --> 01:10:56.920
I have this dream of me
getting on top of her. man.

1038
01:10:56.955 --> 01:10:58.427
And it's not enough.

1039
01:10:58.462 --> 01:10:59.791
We deserve more.

1040
01:10:59.826 --> 01:11:01.826
I try to go out of my way
to make sure

1041
01:11:01.861 --> 01:11:03.289
you feel comfortable.

1042
01:11:03.324 --> 01:11:05.093
that you always have
your latest games.

1043
01:11:05.128 --> 01:11:06.666
Are you married?

1044
01:11:06.701 --> 01:11:08.030
Hmm.

1045
01:11:08.065 --> 01:11:09.834
Am I wrong. though?
Like...

1046
01:11:09.869 --> 01:11:11.341
She cheated on me with a guy.

1047
01:11:11.376 --> 01:11:13.343
I need someone
to be there for me.

1048
01:11:13.378 --> 01:11:14.608
Am I overreacting?

1049
01:11:14.643 --> 01:11:15.807
Oh. we'll see.

1050
01:11:15.842 --> 01:11:16.973
All right. bro.

1051
01:11:17.008 --> 01:11:18.139
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

1052
01:11:18.174 --> 01:11:19.382
Appreciate it.

1053
01:11:28.184 --> 01:11:29.359
How are you holding up?

1054
01:11:30.527 --> 01:11:31.889
I'm hanging.

1055
01:11:31.924 --> 01:11:33.220
How's Kevin?

1056
01:11:33.255 --> 01:11:35.695
He's okay.
He's at the doctor. so...

1057
01:11:35.730 --> 01:11:37.730
Okay. good.

1058
01:11:37.765 --> 01:11:39.094
You ready for your
last appointment?

1059
01:11:40.328 --> 01:11:41.503
Yeah. no choice.

1060
01:11:42.704 --> 01:11:44.638
Yeah. let's get it done.

1061
01:11:44.673 --> 01:11:45.837
You got it.

1062
01:11:47.709 --> 01:11:49.005
Oh. Melissa.

1063
01:11:51.581 --> 01:11:52.778
Thank you.

1064
01:12:18.773 --> 01:12:20.201
I'm sorry about this.

1065
01:12:20.236 --> 01:12:21.840
I had an accident.

1066
01:12:21.875 --> 01:12:23.237
Oh. no worries.

1067
01:12:26.814 --> 01:12:28.011
<i>Shit.</i>

1068
01:12:28.046 --> 01:12:30.046
Malcolm. is it?

1069
01:12:30.081 --> 01:12:31.487
It is.

1070
01:12:33.381 --> 01:12:34.424
Veronica. right?

1071
01:12:34.459 --> 01:12:36.382
Yes. it is.

1072
01:12:36.417 --> 01:12:38.791
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

1073
01:12:38.826 --> 01:12:40.463
Please take a seat.

1074
01:12:42.467 --> 01:12:43.730
<i>Why are you here?</i>

1075
01:12:45.965 --> 01:12:47.228
<i>You figured it out?</i>

1076
01:12:48.396 --> 01:12:49.472
Damn.

1077
01:12:49.507 --> 01:12:51.199
Okay.

1078
01:12:51.234 --> 01:12:52.442
Sorry about that.

1079
01:12:54.237 --> 01:12:56.270
I had a little accident
a minute ago.

1080
01:13:02.113 --> 01:13:05.983
So. what brings you in?

1081
01:13:06.018 --> 01:13:08.414
Oh. you just get right to it?

1082
01:13:08.449 --> 01:13:09.756
-Okay.
-Um...

1083
01:13:09.791 --> 01:13:11.219
I'm sorry about that.

1084
01:13:11.254 --> 01:13:12.319
How's your day?

1085
01:13:12.354 --> 01:13:14.387
<i>I'm completely fucking up.</i>

1086
01:13:14.422 --> 01:13:15.663
Malcolm.

1087
01:13:16.831 --> 01:13:17.962
Yes.

1088
01:13:17.997 --> 01:13:19.425
<i>Why are you messing with me?</i>

1089
01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:21.064
<i>Just come out and say it.</i>

1090
01:13:21.099 --> 01:13:23.363
Is it okay if I ask you
some questions first?

1091
01:13:24.773 --> 01:13:26.135
Of course.

1092
01:13:26.170 --> 01:13:27.675
It's just my first time
doing this.

1093
01:13:27.710 --> 01:13:29.237
and I feel it'll help me...

1094
01:13:29.272 --> 01:13:30.579
Open up.

1095
01:13:30.614 --> 01:13:32.845
I understand.

1096
01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:34.583
What would you like to know?

1097
01:13:34.618 --> 01:13:36.178
How long have
you been doing this?

1098
01:13:38.446 --> 01:13:40.116
Almost a year.

1099
01:13:40.151 --> 01:13:41.381
Hmm.

1100
01:13:43.385 --> 01:13:45.792
What made you want to do this?

1101
01:13:45.827 --> 01:13:48.861
People hurting people.

1102
01:13:51.866 --> 01:13:54.031
You can give a person
everything and...

1103
01:13:56.233 --> 01:13:58.332
get nothing.
but pain every time.

1104
01:13:58.367 --> 01:14:00.367
You're talking from experience?

1105
01:14:02.008 --> 01:14:05.174
Tell me about your experiences.

1106
01:14:07.046 --> 01:14:09.442
Talking about relationships?

1107
01:14:09.477 --> 01:14:10.982
Talking about...

1108
01:14:12.887 --> 01:14:14.524
whatever the question
means to you.

1109
01:14:16.825 --> 01:14:19.056
We're here to talk
about you. not me.

1110
01:14:21.665 --> 01:14:23.027
Next question.

1111
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:28.065
What's this?

1112
01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:29.902
The infinity symbol.

1113
01:14:29.937 --> 01:14:33.939
I know.
but there's a piece missing.

1114
01:14:35.437 --> 01:14:36.711
It's broken.

1115
01:14:38.209 --> 01:14:41.782
When a spouse cheats.
they're breaking vows.

1116
01:14:44.622 --> 01:14:46.413
Tell me something about you.

1117
01:14:46.448 --> 01:14:47.920
In time.

1118
01:14:51.189 --> 01:14:52.760
Are you married?

1119
01:14:52.795 --> 01:14:55.598
I am single. actually.

1120
01:14:55.633 --> 01:14:57.259
You?

1121
01:14:57.294 --> 01:15:00.097
But you do couples therapy.

1122
01:15:00.132 --> 01:15:02.264
I do.

1123
01:15:02.299 --> 01:15:03.771
Do I need to be
in a relationship

1124
01:15:03.806 --> 01:15:05.707
to do couples therapy?

1125
01:15:05.742 --> 01:15:06.873
No.

1126
01:15:06.908 --> 01:15:08.006
I'm sorry.

1127
01:15:08.041 --> 01:15:10.679
Yeah. I'm single. at the moment.

1128
01:15:10.714 --> 01:15:11.944
At the moment.

1129
01:15:13.277 --> 01:15:15.541
So that means
there's someone.

1130
01:15:15.576 --> 01:15:17.378
you're just not sure
how serious it is.

1131
01:15:18.755 --> 01:15:20.414
It's complicated.

1132
01:15:20.449 --> 01:15:21.756
It's always complicated.

1133
01:15:23.221 --> 01:15:24.627
But not with you.

1134
01:15:26.455 --> 01:15:27.729
What do you mean?

1135
01:15:27.764 --> 01:15:29.599
I see you embedded this.

1136
01:15:30.899 --> 01:15:32.426
Why?

1137
01:15:32.461 --> 01:15:33.900
Because you gave it to me.

1138
01:15:37.939 --> 01:15:39.235
Tell me.

1139
01:15:40.469 --> 01:15:42.238
Do you ever think about
that night?

1140
01:15:45.683 --> 01:15:48.277
Uh. thank you.
I think that's everything.

1141
01:15:53.317 --> 01:15:54.756
Maybe we can...

1142
01:15:55.957 --> 01:15:58.221
do this again sometime?

1143
01:15:58.256 --> 01:15:59.354
Maybe.

1144
01:16:09.597 --> 01:16:11.432
Does she make
you dinner every night?

1145
01:16:14.811 --> 01:16:16.008
Most nights.

1146
01:16:17.814 --> 01:16:20.342
Does she take care of the kids.
keep the house clean?

1147
01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:25.017
Yeah.

1148
01:16:26.647 --> 01:16:27.789
Do you?

1149
01:16:31.289 --> 01:16:32.662
I mean. I have work.

1150
01:16:34.127 --> 01:16:35.357
Does she work?

1151
01:16:40.298 --> 01:16:41.462
Yeah.

1152
01:16:42.971 --> 01:16:44.905
So she loves you.

1153
01:16:46.337 --> 01:16:47.941
Look. just because
people have been together

1154
01:16:47.976 --> 01:16:49.943
for a long time.
it doesn't mean

1155
01:16:49.978 --> 01:16:52.341
the romance
or affection has died.

1156
01:16:52.376 --> 01:16:54.882
It just changes.

1157
01:16:54.917 --> 01:16:57.720
I mean. what do
you want from her?

1158
01:17:00.351 --> 01:17:01.988
Want her to bring you
flowers every day.

1159
01:17:03.519 --> 01:17:04.991
Do you bring her flowers?

1160
01:17:08.898 --> 01:17:10.799
So. maybe she's feeling

1161
01:17:10.834 --> 01:17:12.493
some of what you're feeling
right now.

1162
01:17:14.530 --> 01:17:17.366
And you said you've tried
everything. I mean. have you?

1163
01:17:17.401 --> 01:17:21.843
If you simply just tried
to sit down and talk with her.

1164
01:17:21.878 --> 01:17:25.506
communicate how you feel
and why you feel this way.

1165
01:17:25.541 --> 01:17:28.850
and then ask her how she feels.

1166
01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:34.581
You ever thought about
being a therapist?

1167
01:17:38.686 --> 01:17:39.861
What up. boss?

1168
01:17:39.896 --> 01:17:40.961
You ready
for your 2 o'clock?

1169
01:17:42.525 --> 01:17:46.164
Kevin. has a Veronica Wilson
called in.

1170
01:17:46.199 --> 01:17:47.737
to make her next appointment?

1171
01:17:47.772 --> 01:17:49.530
She still hasn't.
but I'll be sure to let you know

1172
01:17:49.565 --> 01:17:51.598
when she does. I got you.

1173
01:17:51.633 --> 01:17:52.742
Damn.

1174
01:17:52.777 --> 01:17:53.941
Oh. matter of fact. you know

1175
01:17:53.976 --> 01:17:55.404
her number's on the file. right?

1176
01:17:55.439 --> 01:17:56.537
I'm just saying.

1177
01:17:57.705 --> 01:17:59.881
I know.

1178
01:17:59.916 --> 01:18:02.345
But what do I always tell you?

1179
01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:03.918
Not to eat chocolate
at work again.

1180
01:18:03.953 --> 01:18:06.349
If I want to kill myself.
do it on my own time.

1181
01:18:06.384 --> 01:18:07.581
The other thing.

1182
01:18:09.387 --> 01:18:10.727
To be patient.

1183
01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:15.655
I'm letting her come to me.

1184
01:18:38.647 --> 01:18:40.152
<i>Why did you come here?</i>

1185
01:18:42.288 --> 01:18:43.991
<i>If I have to be honest.</i>

1186
01:18:44.026 --> 01:18:46.026
<i>I didn't think it would take you</i>
<i>this long to come back.</i>

1187
01:18:49.427 --> 01:18:50.591
Hey.

1188
01:18:50.626 --> 01:18:51.933
Hey. hey.

1189
01:18:51.968 --> 01:18:53.099
I hope you don't mind.

1190
01:18:53.134 --> 01:18:54.661
The door was open and I just...

1191
01:18:54.696 --> 01:18:56.168
Excuse me. miss.
what's your name?

1192
01:18:56.203 --> 01:18:57.598
Veronica.

1193
01:18:57.633 --> 01:18:58.973
Veronica.

1194
01:18:59.008 --> 01:19:01.008
Yes. Veronica Wilson.

1195
01:19:01.043 --> 01:19:02.141
-I had an appointment.
-Yeah.

1196
01:19:02.176 --> 01:19:03.571
You called yesterday.

1197
01:19:03.606 --> 01:19:05.144
but your phone was like
a little static.

1198
01:19:05.179 --> 01:19:05.947
What you got.
a little android or something?

1199
01:19:05.982 --> 01:19:07.740
Thank you. Kevin.

1200
01:19:07.775 --> 01:19:09.148
Okay.

1201
01:19:09.183 --> 01:19:10.347
Um. do y'all need anything?

1202
01:19:10.382 --> 01:19:12.019
-I'm fine.
-You sure?

1203
01:19:12.054 --> 01:19:13.119
I'll be right out here
if you do.

1204
01:19:13.154 --> 01:19:15.187
Kevin. close the door.

1205
01:19:15.222 --> 01:19:16.892
Well. I'm gonna do some
paperwork or something.

1206
01:19:19.490 --> 01:19:20.720
Did you tell him about me?

1207
01:19:22.691 --> 01:19:26.396
Uh. did I...

1208
01:19:29.907 --> 01:19:31.203
Please. take a seat.

1209
01:19:37.981 --> 01:19:39.640
I'm glad you decided
to come back.

1210
01:19:40.885 --> 01:19:42.148
Can I ask you a question?

1211
01:19:42.183 --> 01:19:44.315
More questions?

1212
01:19:44.350 --> 01:19:46.350
I know.

1213
01:19:46.385 --> 01:19:47.516
You know.
you're not paying me

1214
01:19:47.551 --> 01:19:49.452
to learn about me.

1215
01:19:49.487 --> 01:19:50.585
<i>Or are you?</i>

1216
01:19:55.196 --> 01:19:57.724
I was just wondering
if it's at all possible

1217
01:19:57.759 --> 01:19:59.594
to have sessions elsewhere.

1218
01:20:00.696 --> 01:20:02.399
Elsewhere?

1219
01:20:02.434 --> 01:20:03.873
I know that's unprofessional.

1220
01:20:03.908 --> 01:20:06.469
I just think that
a different environment

1221
01:20:06.504 --> 01:20:08.606
might help me
communicate better.

1222
01:20:11.674 --> 01:20:12.739
I understand.

1223
01:20:15.051 --> 01:20:16.215
I know a place.

1224
01:20:19.748 --> 01:20:20.956
Is this better?

1225
01:20:22.421 --> 01:20:23.585
Much better.

1226
01:20:24.786 --> 01:20:28.359
You know. I'm the same way.

1227
01:20:28.394 --> 01:20:30.262
What do you mean?

1228
01:20:30.297 --> 01:20:32.935
How about just this
once we talk about you?

1229
01:20:34.763 --> 01:20:36.367
Well. I appreciate
what you're doing.

1230
01:20:37.535 --> 01:20:38.864
It definitely helps.

1231
01:20:38.899 --> 01:20:40.107
Yeah.

1232
01:20:43.574 --> 01:20:44.771
I have an idea.

1233
01:20:46.412 --> 01:20:49.281
Instead of these being like
typical therapy sessions.

1234
01:20:50.746 --> 01:20:52.053
why don't we be friends?

1235
01:20:53.782 --> 01:20:55.958
What do you mean. friends?

1236
01:20:55.993 --> 01:20:58.026
I mean. instead of us
meeting at my office

1237
01:20:58.061 --> 01:21:00.963
once a week.
we can meet at other places.

1238
01:21:03.099 --> 01:21:04.395
Like dating?

1239
01:21:06.135 --> 01:21:08.003
Uh. no. not like dating.

1240
01:21:09.798 --> 01:21:11.501
Just until you feel comfortable.

1241
01:21:15.639 --> 01:21:17.177
I'll choose the next place.

1242
01:21:40.631 --> 01:21:42.103
Okay. okay. okay.

1243
01:21:42.138 --> 01:21:43.335
Okay.

1244
01:21:43.370 --> 01:21:44.699
You okay?

1245
01:21:46.109 --> 01:21:47.933
I can't believe I agreed to it.

1246
01:21:47.968 --> 01:21:49.638
What were you expecting?

1247
01:21:49.673 --> 01:21:51.409
Dinner and movie?

1248
01:21:51.444 --> 01:21:52.575
Maybe.

1249
01:22:10.133 --> 01:22:11.330
You come here a lot?

1250
01:22:12.861 --> 01:22:15.169
I used to.

1251
01:22:15.204 --> 01:22:17.402
My parents used to bring me
and my sister here all the time.

1252
01:22:19.538 --> 01:22:20.801
Why used to?

1253
01:22:23.872 --> 01:22:26.543
Is it me or does it seem like
every family has that

1254
01:22:26.578 --> 01:22:28.809
one family member that
keeps everyone together.

1255
01:22:30.417 --> 01:22:33.187
the person that keeps
everyone in check?

1256
01:22:35.015 --> 01:22:39.160
No matter what they did.
if the family messes up.

1257
01:22:39.195 --> 01:22:41.756
you forgive family and move on.

1258
01:22:42.924 --> 01:22:44.990
That's it.

1259
01:22:45.025 --> 01:22:46.266
Seems that way.

1260
01:22:48.369 --> 01:22:50.270
Yeah. that's...

1261
01:22:51.999 --> 01:22:53.669
that's what my mom was for us.

1262
01:22:55.442 --> 01:22:59.708
She. uh. she kept us together.

1263
01:22:59.743 --> 01:23:01.512
Me. my dad. and my sister.

1264
01:23:03.043 --> 01:23:04.713
She was always there...

1265
01:23:07.047 --> 01:23:08.288
until she wasn't.

1266
01:23:11.425 --> 01:23:12.754
What happened to her?

1267
01:23:15.561 --> 01:23:19.860
She died. and none of us
were ready for it.

1268
01:23:24.064 --> 01:23:25.371
How did she pass?

1269
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:29.573
I remember her telling me

1270
01:23:29.608 --> 01:23:31.080
I was gonna have
a baby brother.

1271
01:23:34.613 --> 01:23:36.217
But she died giving birth.

1272
01:23:40.553 --> 01:23:41.915
What about the baby?

1273
01:23:44.755 --> 01:23:46.161
Baby didn't make it. either.

1274
01:23:50.794 --> 01:23:53.300
Things changed.

1275
01:23:53.335 --> 01:23:55.071
You and your family
ever since. huh?

1276
01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:00.604
Yeah. it's been a while.

1277
01:24:02.146 --> 01:24:06.115
but for years I just tried
to stay in front of it.

1278
01:24:06.150 --> 01:24:10.977
not face it. but I miss my mom.

1279
01:24:12.651 --> 01:24:13.980
I miss my family.

1280
01:24:15.753 --> 01:24:20.085
You and your family been
distant with each other

1281
01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:21.328
ever since your mom?

1282
01:24:23.299 --> 01:24:28.665
Yeah. I've been distant.
we've all been distant.

1283
01:24:30.207 --> 01:24:31.536
Yeah.

1284
01:24:33.507 --> 01:24:35.144
It happens that way sometimes.

1285
01:24:37.973 --> 01:24:40.842
Even though your mother is
no longer with us. I'm sure...

1286
01:24:42.615 --> 01:24:45.517
she'd want all of you
to still be close.

1287
01:24:47.521 --> 01:24:49.015
still love each other.

1288
01:24:52.361 --> 01:24:54.053
Maybe you can be
that person now.

1289
01:25:24.019 --> 01:25:29.429
<i>People. I can't say</i>
<i>why people fascinate me so much.</i>

1290
01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:33.499
<i>If I had to give a reason.</i>

1291
01:25:33.534 --> 01:25:35.600
<i>it's because</i>
<i>we're so different...</i>

1292
01:25:37.032 --> 01:25:40.176
<i>each and every one of us.</i>

1293
01:25:41.575 --> 01:25:43.069

- Hey. Daddy.

1324
01:28:12.693 --> 01:28:14.220
-Hey.
-Good to see you.

1325
01:28:14.255 --> 01:28:15.727
-Did you miss me?

1326
01:28:15.762 --> 01:28:17.223
-How are you?
-- Hey. Emma.

1327
01:28:17.258 --> 01:28:18.499
-Good to see you.
-Nice to see you.

1328
01:28:18.534 --> 01:28:20.061
Daddy. this is-

1329
01:28:20.096 --> 01:28:21.161
Malcolm.

1330
01:28:21.196 --> 01:28:22.734
Hey.
How you doing?

1331
01:28:22.769 --> 01:28:24.868
I'm good.
Small world.

1332
01:28:24.903 --> 01:28:26.738
Wait. how do you two know
each other?

1333
01:28:26.773 --> 01:28:29.807
Oh. you're a patient of his?

1334
01:28:29.842 --> 01:28:32.238
Not of his.
His partner. Calvin.

1335
01:28:32.273 --> 01:28:34.581
I've known Malcolm
for a few years.

1336
01:28:34.616 --> 01:28:37.210
Him and Calvin.
they're good men.

1337
01:28:37.245 --> 01:28:39.421
Okay.
Well. this is my sister. Emma.

1338
01:28:39.456 --> 01:28:41.522
<i>Please don't say it.</i>

1339
01:28:41.557 --> 01:28:44.690
We've met. actually.

1340
01:28:44.725 --> 01:28:46.120
Oh. really?

1341
01:28:47.695 --> 01:28:49.189
Okay. well...

1342
01:28:49.224 --> 01:28:51.092
I'm sorry.

1343
01:28:51.127 --> 01:28:52.566
I got. I got to take this.
Hello?

1344
01:28:54.471 --> 01:28:56.537
Yeah.

1345
01:28:56.572 --> 01:28:58.033
-Okay.
-Always busy.

1346
01:28:58.068 --> 01:28:59.166
Yeah. I'm on my way right now.

1347
01:28:59.201 --> 01:29:00.409
Okay.

1348
01:29:02.039 --> 01:29:03.577
I'm sorry. I gotta.
I gotta to take off.

1349
01:29:03.612 --> 01:29:05.546
-Seriously?
-Yeah. it's... it's work.

1350
01:29:05.581 --> 01:29:06.877
- Okay.

1351
01:29:06.912 --> 01:29:09.583
Hey. I'll see you soon.

1352
01:29:13.314 --> 01:29:15.556
I'm sorry. he's...
You wanna sit?

1353
01:29:28.230 --> 01:29:31.264
<i>How did I miss this...</i>
<i>projection?</i>

1354
01:29:32.476 --> 01:29:34.740
<i>It was obvious.</i>

1355
01:29:34.775 --> 01:29:38.304
<i>But I've been too consumed</i>
<i>with you. I missed it.</i>

1356
01:29:40.176 --> 01:29:41.516
<i>I know this is it.</i>

1357
01:29:43.113 --> 01:29:45.487
<i>Maybe it should be.</i>

1358
01:29:45.522 --> 01:29:47.280
<i>I'm losing myself to this woman.</i>

1359
01:29:48.756 --> 01:29:51.757
<i>Once Emma tells her</i>
<i>what happened. that's it.</i>

1360
01:30:19.655 --> 01:30:21.688
Are you okay?

1361
01:30:21.723 --> 01:30:23.019
Um...

1362
01:30:35.495 --> 01:30:38.573
Malcolm. I've been there.

1363
01:30:40.467 --> 01:30:44.073
I want you to know that
if you need someone to talk to.

1364
01:30:46.682 --> 01:30:47.978
I'm here for you.

1365
01:30:48.013 --> 01:30:50.013
<i>Talk about what exactly?</i>

1366
01:30:50.048 --> 01:30:52.015
Actually. yeah.

1367
01:30:54.481 --> 01:30:56.316
I actually do need
somebody to talk to.

1368
01:30:57.891 --> 01:30:59.154
<i>What do you know?</i>

1369
01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:04.423
I. uh...

1370
01:31:12.741 --> 01:31:14.103
I've been there.

1371
01:31:15.777 --> 01:31:17.810
Yeah.

1372
01:31:17.845 --> 01:31:19.273
We've all had our hearts broken.

1373
01:31:24.753 --> 01:31:30.218
I'll be... here for you
if you need someone any time.

1374
01:31:38.129 --> 01:31:39.634
Melissa. I wanna...

1375
01:31:41.462 --> 01:31:43.033
I wanna ask you a question.

1376
01:31:44.234 --> 01:31:45.574
Okay.

1377
01:31:45.609 --> 01:31:46.938
And I want the truth.

1378
01:31:53.914 --> 01:31:55.383
How do you know Veronica?

1379
01:31:58.446 --> 01:32:00.820
I don't know anyone
named Veronica.

1380
01:32:04.485 --> 01:32:05.924
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1381
01:32:05.959 --> 01:32:07.321
You don't know
what I'm talking about.

1382
01:32:09.996 --> 01:32:12.524
You know. uh.
not too long ago.

1383
01:32:12.559 --> 01:32:16.869
you told me that...
you care about me.

1384
01:32:16.904 --> 01:32:18.068
I do.

1385
01:32:18.103 --> 01:32:20.037
As you see me.

1386
01:32:20.072 --> 01:32:21.775
I do.

1387
01:32:21.810 --> 01:32:23.403
All I. all I want is the truth.

1388
01:32:29.818 --> 01:32:31.785
I... hired her.

1389
01:32:35.692 --> 01:32:37.120
Wait. what?

1390
01:32:39.124 --> 01:32:40.519
I hired her.

1391
01:32:44.668 --> 01:32:47.801
I hired her to hurt you
the way that you hurt me.

1392
01:32:52.709 --> 01:32:54.335
You fucked my sister?

1393
01:32:57.274 --> 01:32:58.504
Huh?

1394
01:33:07.856 --> 01:33:08.987
<i>You were there with Zach</i>

1395
01:33:09.022 --> 01:33:10.725
<i>for the same reason I was.</i>

1396
01:33:16.700 --> 01:33:18.524
You were hired to be with me?

1397
01:33:21.804 --> 01:33:23.232
Um. excuse me. sir.

1398
01:33:24.972 --> 01:33:27.742
Do you need me to reschedule
your next appointment?

1399
01:33:37.820 --> 01:33:39.314
No. Kevin. it's. uh. it's okay.

1400
01:33:39.349 --> 01:33:40.579
You could send him in.

1401
01:33:50.767 --> 01:33:52.030
- I'm sorry.

1402
01:34:07.949 --> 01:34:11.049
Johnathon.
hey. how's it going?

1403
01:34:12.283 --> 01:34:13.579
Uh...

1404
01:34:13.614 --> 01:34:14.954
Yeah. I understand.
Have a seat.

1405
01:34:19.356 --> 01:34:22.489
Sounds like you're having
some lady problems of your own.

1406
01:34:22.524 --> 01:34:24.524
Yeah.

1407
01:34:24.559 --> 01:34:25.624
Where's Hilda?

1408
01:34:27.133 --> 01:34:28.561
It's just me today.

1409
01:34:34.910 --> 01:34:36.107
Um...

1410
01:35:05.171 --> 01:35:06.731
<i>I thought</i>
<i>I wanted what you wanted.</i>

1411
01:35:06.766 --> 01:35:10.977
<i>Johnathon. love. a family.</i>

1412
01:35:12.574 --> 01:35:14.673
<i>Looks like neither</i>
<i>one of us is getting that.</i>

1413
01:35:36.598 --> 01:35:38.664
<i>Nine days since we last talked.</i>

1414
01:35:40.470 --> 01:35:42.338
<i>We have more in common</i>
<i>than I knew.</i>

1415
01:35:43.638 --> 01:35:45.275
<i>both living two lives.</i>

1416
01:35:46.949 --> 01:35:49.609
<i>For a moment. I thought</i>
<i>I wanted more with you.</i>

1417
01:35:59.489 --> 01:36:01.753
<i>What can I say?</i>

1418
01:36:01.788 --> 01:36:06.230
<i>I tried to stop thinking</i>
<i>about you. but yet I come here.</i>

1419
01:36:09.004 --> 01:36:10.905
<i>I wonder</i>
<i>if I ever crossed your mind.</i>

1420
01:36:14.471 --> 01:36:15.701
Mind if I join you?

1421
01:36:18.475 --> 01:36:19.540
Please do.

1422
01:36:21.346 --> 01:36:22.576
What brings you here?

1423
01:36:25.988 --> 01:36:27.053
You.

1424
01:36:28.485 --> 01:36:30.320
-Look. I'm sorry-
-What happened between me-

1425
01:36:32.027 --> 01:36:34.786
Wow. this is crazy.

1426
01:36:34.821 --> 01:36:36.898
This isn't me.
I don't. I don't do this.

1427
01:36:38.330 --> 01:36:40.627
Do what?

1428
01:36:40.662 --> 01:36:42.970
Fumble over my words.
not sure what to say.

1429
01:36:43.005 --> 01:36:47.733
This is. uh.
definitely new territory for me.

1430
01:36:47.768 --> 01:36:49.339
Well. then let me go first.

1431
01:36:52.949 --> 01:36:56.082
I was hired to hurt you.

1432
01:36:56.117 --> 01:36:57.919
Hired?

1433
01:36:57.954 --> 01:36:59.811
Wow. Let me. let me
ask you a question.

1434
01:36:59.846 --> 01:37:03.485
if you didn't. would you give
a refund or that you just...

1435
01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:05.223
Malcolm.

1436
01:37:06.556 --> 01:37:09.656
I don't do relationships.

1437
01:37:09.691 --> 01:37:10.822
Okay?

1438
01:37:10.857 --> 01:37:12.263
Uh-huh.

1439
01:37:12.298 --> 01:37:15.002
It's hard for me to trust
and not because

1440
01:37:15.037 --> 01:37:17.004
some guy broke my heart
or anything like that.

1441
01:37:17.039 --> 01:37:19.171
it's just...

1442
01:37:19.206 --> 01:37:23.703
My parents. for example.
my dad was all about my mom

1443
01:37:23.738 --> 01:37:28.180
and now that she's gone.
he's in constant pain.

1444
01:37:28.215 --> 01:37:30.578
pain that I don't ever
want to experience.

1445
01:37:32.054 --> 01:37:33.086
Okay?

1446
01:37:33.121 --> 01:37:34.087
And I've learned that everything

1447
01:37:34.122 --> 01:37:35.814
has an expiration date.

1448
01:37:37.092 --> 01:37:38.322
even love.

1449
01:37:41.822 --> 01:37:44.262
I don't do relationships.
either.

1450
01:37:44.297 --> 01:37:45.395
I don't believe in them.

1451
01:37:47.729 --> 01:37:51.269
I believe that everything
is temporary.

1452
01:37:51.304 --> 01:37:52.974
that we all drain
the special moments

1453
01:37:53.009 --> 01:37:54.437
in our lives so much.

1454
01:37:56.441 --> 01:37:57.605
they're no longer special.

1455
01:37:59.939 --> 01:38:03.952
Then I met you
and every moment was special.

1456
01:38:06.583 --> 01:38:08.583
Like you said. everything
has an expiration date.

1457
01:38:08.618 --> 01:38:10.783
so with the little time
we have left with our lives.

1458
01:38:10.818 --> 01:38:13.687
I don't want to waste another
moment without you in it.

1459
01:38:15.262 --> 01:38:17.064
I'm not saying
let's go get married

1460
01:38:17.099 --> 01:38:18.395
or anything like that.
I'm just saying time

1461
01:38:18.430 --> 01:38:21.761
without you in it is
a waste of time.

1462
01:38:25.668 --> 01:38:28.768
Malcolm. I'm sorry.
I just-I can't.

1463
01:40:57.919 --> 01:40:59.160
You followed me?

1464
01:41:00.988 --> 01:41:02.493
You recorded our conversation?

1465
01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:05.331
I did.

1466
01:41:09.469 --> 01:41:10.864
You plan on releasing it?

1467
01:41:12.802 --> 01:41:13.966
I do.

1468
01:41:16.608 --> 01:41:17.673
Good.

1469
01:41:21.514 --> 01:41:22.810
I thought you didn't
want them to know.

1470
01:41:26.651 --> 01:41:28.123
I want them to know.

1471
01:41:31.821 --> 01:41:33.623
Wait.

1472
01:41:33.658 --> 01:41:34.987
Malcolm.

1473
01:41:41.127 --> 01:41:44.634
<i>She knows</i>
<i>the truth. who I am.</i>

1474
01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.835
<i>There's only one thing left</i>
<i>for me to do.</i>

1475
01:41:52.677 --> 01:41:54.446
<i>- He should just mind</i>
<i>his own damn business.</i>

1476
01:41:54.481 --> 01:41:56.140
<i>Like. why are you doing this?</i>

1477
01:41:56.175 --> 01:41:57.977
<i>- He wears a mask.</i>

1478
01:41:58.012 --> 01:42:00.188
<i>- If anyone knows</i>
<i>who this man is. tell us.</i>

1479
01:42:00.223 --> 01:42:01.816
<i>- I don't think he is real.</i>

1480
01:42:01.851 --> 01:42:03.114
<i>- I don't think</i>
<i>he is real.</i>

1481
01:42:03.149 --> 01:42:04.148
<i>- Did you see the video?</i>

1482
01:42:04.183 --> 01:42:05.853
<i>He looks pretty real.</i>

1483
01:42:05.888 --> 01:42:07.393
<i>-- He helped me.</i>
<i>-- He helped me.</i>

1484
01:42:07.428 --> 01:42:08.625
<i>-I love him.</i>
<i>-- I love him.</i>

1485
01:42:08.660 --> 01:42:10.330
<i>- I think he's dreamy.</i>

1486
01:42:10.365 --> 01:42:11.991
<i>It's this envelope</i>

1487
01:42:12.026 --> 01:42:13.762
<i>with the word Truth.</i>

1488
01:42:15.029 --> 01:42:16.204
<i>Messiah.</i>

1489
01:42:18.065 --> 01:42:21.473
<i>- Many of you</i>
<i>have questioned if I exist.</i>

1490
01:42:21.508 --> 01:42:25.345
<i>by now.</i>
<i>you know the truth. I do.</i>

1491
01:42:26.777 --> 01:42:29.712
<i>I have made a serious</i>
<i>impact on the lives</i>

1492
01:42:29.747 --> 01:42:31.846
<i>of many with my line of work.</i>

1493
01:42:33.421 --> 01:42:35.685
<i>You have questions.</i>

1494
01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:38.853
<i>but your biggest question is.</i>
<i>who am I?</i>
