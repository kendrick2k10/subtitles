3
00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:15.366
- Boy. am I glad school is out.

4
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:17.368
I could really use the vacation.

5
00:01:17.368 --> 00:01:20.914
I was wondering
why you showed up late today.

6
00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:23.458
Honestly. I'm a little
surprised you showed up at all.

7
00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:25.418
- Well. a promise is a promise.

8
00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:27.504
I just didn't promise
to be here early.

9
00:01:27.504 --> 00:01:29.547
Well.
you did miss my mom's

10
00:01:29.547 --> 00:01:33.718
famous chocolate chip
muffins. but I saved you two.

11
00:01:33.718 --> 00:01:35.053
- Dude. you're awesome.

12
00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:37.013
- I know.

13
00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:39.641
So. while you're working
on those muffins.

14
00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:41.935
I think that we should
maybe talk about our plans.

15
00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:43.186
- Yup.

16
00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:44.395
- Well. I was thinking
maybe we could use

17
00:01:44.395 --> 00:01:46.689
that shed in the woods
around the corner?

18
00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:47.732
- Sounds great to me.

19
00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:50.318
- So. when do you wanna start?

20
00:01:50.318 --> 00:01:51.820
- How about tomorrow afternoon?

21
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.614
I've got a dentist
appointment in the morning.

22
00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:55.532
- Works for me.

23
00:01:57.534 --> 00:01:59.702
- Hi. guys!
- Katie!

24
00:01:59.702 --> 00:02:01.204
What are you doing here?

25
00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:04.541
- Uh. I live here. Cam.
Say. what you working on?

26
00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:07.085
- Um. a project.

27
00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:09.045
- Can I help. please? Can I?

28
00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:11.548
- No. You're too small.

29
00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:12.507
- Cam?

30
00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:14.008
- Sorry. Katie. Not this time.

31
00:02:15.426 --> 00:02:18.221
Hey. Bryson. do you wanna
take a ride around the lake?

32
00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:20.014
- Cam.

33
00:02:20.014 --> 00:02:21.724
- Katie. we'll see
you later. okay?

34
00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:42.620
- Kids. time to eat.

35
00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:48.001
Where's Cameron?
- He might be in the garage.

36
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.086
- Can you go get him. please?
- Sure. Mom.

37
00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:57.093
- Anna. Drew? Put your
things away. please.

38
00:02:57.093 --> 00:03:00.889
- But Mom. I'm right in the
middle of texting Alison.

39
00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.265
- We're gonna have a nice
family dinner tonight.

40
00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:03.600
without electronics.

41
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.601
Alison can wait.

42
00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:11.107
- You just can't seem
to stop reading now.

43
00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:12.066
can you. Einstein?

44
00:03:16.654 --> 00:03:17.488
Noodles?

45
00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:20.158
Again. Mom?

46
00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:23.494
- Cam. I'm doing the best that
I can right now. Let's pray.

47
00:03:23.494 --> 00:03:26.122
- Can I pray. Mom?
- Sure. go ahead.

48
00:03:26.122 --> 00:03:28.124
- Dear Jesus. thank you for this

49
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.502
delicious supper.

50
00:03:31.502 --> 00:03:35.423
Please bless it to our bodies
and help us not to complain.

51
00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:37.217
In Jesus' name. amen.
- Amen.

52
00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:40.428
- How'd your project
go today. Cam?

53
00:03:40.428 --> 00:03:41.804
- Project? What project?

54
00:03:41.804 --> 00:03:43.306
- Probably making rocket fuel

55
00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:45.183
out of beanstalks or something.

56
00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:48.186
- Actually. there's a present
study underway in Norway

57
00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:50.813
where scientists are
experimenting with ideology

58
00:03:50.813 --> 00:03:53.733
to use plant matter to-
- That's nice. Einstein.

59
00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:55.151
That's not what we're doing.

60
00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:56.653
Look. me and Bryson.

61
00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:58.821
we're just having fun with this
project and it's not illegal

62
00:03:58.821 --> 00:04:00.406
and let's just leave it at that.

63
00:04:01.824 --> 00:04:04.160
- Cameron. I know you're
16. but you have no right

64
00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.162
to speak to me or
your brother that way.

65
00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.801
Chelsea speaking.

66
00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:21.552
Oh. hi. Susanna.

67
00:04:21.552 --> 00:04:24.764
No. you're not interrupting.
I was just packing my lunch.

68
00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:26.391
What's going on?

69
00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:27.350
Really?

70
00:04:28.726 --> 00:04:30.436
Oh. I don't know if I...

71
00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:32.230
Tell you what. I'll
think about it.

72
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.190
and then I'll give
you a call back.

73
00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.818
Sure. Thanks for
letting me know.

74
00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:37.652
Bye.

75
00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:42.407
- Who was that. Mom?

76
00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:43.700
- Mrs. Anderson.
the pastor's wife.

77
00:04:44.742 --> 00:04:45.576
- Oh.

78
00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:48.204
- Can you go get the
others and have 'em

79
00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:50.331
meet me in the living room?

80
00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:51.165
- Yep.

81
00:04:58.881 --> 00:05:00.967
- What're you reading
now. Einstein?

82
00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.010
- Ballastography.

83
00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:04.053
- What?

84
00:05:04.053 --> 00:05:05.555
- Exploring the
liquid sheets of the-

85
00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:08.349
- You know what? I
don't wanna know.

86
00:05:11.352 --> 00:05:12.895
- Thanks for coming. guys.

87
00:05:12.895 --> 00:05:14.981
Mrs. Anderson called
a few minutes ago.

88
00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:16.649
There's something we
need to talk about.

89
00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:19.694
- I'm sorry. Mom. that I
spilled by water all over Emma.

90
00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:20.903
I tripped. honest!

91
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.449
- Katelyn. what're
you talking about?

92
00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.910
- You mean Mrs. Anderson wasn't
calling to tell about me?

93
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.412
- No. dear.

94
00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:30.621
She was calling to tell
me about a lady's retreat

95
00:05:30.621 --> 00:05:32.457
that's happening in
Sandpoint this weekend.

96
00:05:32.457 --> 00:05:35.251
and she wanted to know if
I was interested in going.

97
00:05:35.251 --> 00:05:36.085
- Are you?

98
00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:39.464
- Yes. but I'm not sure about
leaving the four of you alone.

99
00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:41.507
- Oh. come on.
Mom. We'll be fine.

100
00:05:41.507 --> 00:05:42.967
How many days is it?

101
00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:45.928
- I'd leave Thursday night
and come back Saturday night.

102
00:05:45.928 --> 00:05:48.681
- Two days and two
nights. We'll be fine.

103
00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:50.975
- Yeah. Mom. you gotta
go. You need a break.

104
00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:53.728
- I amicably second that motion.

105
00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:54.937
- Katelyn?

106
00:05:54.937 --> 00:05:57.857
- Can I still go to
Vacation Bible School?

107
00:05:57.857 --> 00:05:59.067
- If Cam will take you.

108
00:06:00.234 --> 00:06:01.611
- Sure thing. short stuff.

109
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:02.612
- I say go!

110
00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:04.864
- Bye!
- Bye.

111
00:06:06.282 --> 00:06:09.327
- Have a good weekend. guys.
Don't burn the house down.

112
00:06:17.293 --> 00:06:19.545
- Cam. Cam!

113
00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:22.715
We gotta go to
Vacation Bible School!

114
00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:25.885
- Katie. go get ready!

115
00:06:27.345 --> 00:06:29.931
Anna. Drew? We're
leaving in 15 minutes!

116
00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:53.579
Whoa. whoa.

117
00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:55.164
Who...

118
00:06:55.164 --> 00:06:59.043
You know what? No. just
come on. get in the car.

119
00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:09.929
Okay. yep!

120
00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:16.561
All right. we're here.

121
00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:19.063
- Cam. this isn't
the right church!

122
00:07:19.063 --> 00:07:20.314
- What?

123
00:07:20.314 --> 00:07:21.816
- I said-
- No. I know what you said.

124
00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:23.317
But what do you mean this
isn't the right church?

125
00:07:23.317 --> 00:07:25.570
- It's at Grace Bible Church.

126
00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.531
Up the corner
and two boulevards down.

127
00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:38.708
- I'll be ambulating over
at Nathan's house after.

128
00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:40.543
- Hey. Einstein. whatever
that meant in English.

129
00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:42.128
you need to be home by dinner.

130
00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:42.962
- Naturally.

131
00:07:45.381 --> 00:07:47.508
- Katie. I'll be back
to pick you up at one.

132
00:07:47.508 --> 00:07:49.010
It ends at noon.

133
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.595
- Then I'll pick you up at noon.

134
00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:55.224
Okay. where am I taking you?

135
00:07:55.224 --> 00:07:56.517
- To the mall.

136
00:07:56.517 --> 00:07:58.561
- All right. and next
time we leave the house.

137
00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:01.147
can you please just make
sure that Katie's matching?

138
00:08:04.233 --> 00:08:05.067
- Definitely.

139
00:08:13.075 --> 00:08:15.536
- All right. well. let's put
a little carbon in there.

140
00:08:15.536 --> 00:08:16.454
Yeah. there you go.

141
00:08:18.247 --> 00:08:19.457
Keep it going.

142
00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:21.000
I think we can take a
break for lunch now.

143
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.251
I gotta go pick up Katie.

144
00:08:23.419 --> 00:08:26.214
- Man. it's a quarter
to one. I'm starved.

145
00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:27.048
- What?

146
00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:30.092
I was supposed to be
there at noon. I'm late!

147
00:08:30.092 --> 00:08:31.594
- You go get her. I'll clean up.

148
00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:32.845
- All right. Thanks. man.

149
00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:35.806
Oh. Bryson! My keys.

150
00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:38.309
Here.

151
00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:39.477
- Thanks. man.
- Yeah.

152
00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:45.191
- Katie. I'm so sorry. I
got the times mixed up.

153
00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:47.860
- It's okay. I had
lunch with Miss Nicole.

154
00:08:49.403 --> 00:08:50.905
- How can I make it up to you?

155
00:08:54.116 --> 00:08:55.910
- Will you take me for ice cream

156
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.663
and then play Monopoly with me?

157
00:08:59.872 --> 00:09:01.457
- Yeah. sure. Come on. let's go.

158
00:09:07.129 --> 00:09:08.130
No.

159
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:08.965
- Yes!

160
00:09:10.424 --> 00:09:11.300
I have...

161
00:09:14.303 --> 00:09:16.430
Seven hotels on Boardwalk.

162
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:17.431
- You little squirt.

163
00:09:20.309 --> 00:09:21.644
- Pay it. big brother.

164
00:09:21.644 --> 00:09:22.478
- Katelyn...

165
00:09:23.771 --> 00:09:26.315
I have $11.

166
00:09:26.315 --> 00:09:28.651
You pretty much own
everything that I have.

167
00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:32.572
Can I just go to jail now?

168
00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:33.406
Hello?

169
00:09:34.282 --> 00:09:35.116
Oh. hey. Drew.

170
00:09:37.034 --> 00:09:39.620
Dude. I'm playing
with Katie right now.

171
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.205
Can't they just give you a ride?

172
00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:44.792
I'll be there in
maybe like 10 minutes.

173
00:09:46.043 --> 00:09:48.212
All right. I'll see you then.

174
00:09:48.212 --> 00:09:50.256
- I have 25 million!

175
00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:53.050
I told
you you'd cream me.

176
00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:54.302
I gotta go pick up Drew. okay?

177
00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:55.720
Hey. Anna. will you
just watch Katie?

178
00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.013
I just gotta go pick up Drew.

179
00:09:57.013 --> 00:09:58.681
And maybe think about
something for dinner.

180
00:09:58.681 --> 00:10:01.225
- I don't get a choice?
- Nope. I'll be back soon.

181
00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:03.936
Try and stay
out of trouble. okay?

182
00:10:03.936 --> 00:10:05.438
I gotta go call Alison.

183
00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:07.648
- What about dinner?
- Later!

184
00:10:20.202 --> 00:10:23.205
- Dude. I hope Anna has
dinner ready. I'm starving.

185
00:10:31.005 --> 00:10:33.424
- Sorry. Cam. I burnt dinner.

186
00:10:35.092 --> 00:10:38.054
- I told Anna to make
dinner. not you! Anna!

187
00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:39.513
- I had an important phone call!

188
00:10:39.513 --> 00:10:40.931
I did not know she
was gonna do it.

189
00:10:40.931 --> 00:10:42.475
- Important phone call?

190
00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:43.476
All you ever do is gab on
the phone with your friends!

191
00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:44.935
It's not that important!

192
00:10:44.935 --> 00:10:46.395
- And what do you and
Bryson do? Make worthless...

193
00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:51.692
- Taylor residence.
Katelyn speaking.

194
00:10:51.692 --> 00:10:53.736
Hi. Mom. Mm-hm.

195
00:10:53.736 --> 00:10:54.654
I'll tell them.

196
00:10:55.863 --> 00:10:58.324
Mom's gonna be home at 6:30!

197
00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:00.618
- Tonight?
- Mm-hm.

198
00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:01.410
- Oh. boy.

199
00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:04.955
Okay.

200
00:11:04.955 --> 00:11:06.707
This place has gotta
get cleaned up.

201
00:11:06.707 --> 00:11:08.542
and I'm not doing
it by myself. okay?

202
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:11.754
Look. we have to put
our differences aside

203
00:11:11.754 --> 00:11:14.757
and we have to get this place
cleaned up or we're all dead.

204
00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:17.176
Who's with me?

205
00:11:20.763 --> 00:11:21.597
- Fine.

206
00:11:55.589 --> 00:11:56.924
- I've gotta run to
the Western Grill.

207
00:11:56.924 --> 00:11:58.467
I'll be back soon. Keep it up!

208
00:11:58.467 --> 00:11:59.260
- Okay.

209
00:12:05.641 --> 00:12:07.226
- Mom's coming up the road!

210
00:12:29.832 --> 00:12:31.542
- Hi. kids.

211
00:12:31.542 --> 00:12:32.501
Hi. Mom.

212
00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:35.629
- Wow. The house looks amazing.

213
00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:37.673
And Western Grill for dinner?

214
00:12:37.673 --> 00:12:38.924
Thank you.

215
00:12:38.924 --> 00:12:40.176
No problem. Mom.

216
00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:41.969
- Did everything go smoothly?

217
00:12:41.969 --> 00:12:43.512
- We managed.

218
00:12:43.512 --> 00:12:45.973
Why don't you tell
us about the retreat?

219
00:12:45.973 --> 00:12:49.185
It was so relaxing
and it was so wonderful

220
00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:51.854
to spend time connecting
with other ladies of faith.

221
00:12:53.022 --> 00:12:55.149
What about you guys?
Did you do anything fun?

222
00:13:01.071 --> 00:13:02.948
- Cam. this is great.

223
00:13:02.948 --> 00:13:05.159
At this rate. we'll have
these fireworks done

224
00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:06.368
long before the 4th.

225
00:13:06.368 --> 00:13:08.287
- I know. right? It's
gonna be fantastic.

226
00:13:08.287 --> 00:13:09.121
- Oh. yeah.

227
00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:15.377
- Hey. Bryson?

228
00:13:15.377 --> 00:13:16.212
- Yeah?

229
00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:18.798
- Where's the fire extinguisher?

230
00:13:19.882 --> 00:13:22.635
- I forgot it.
Don't you have one?

231
00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:25.054
- Yeah. actually. I probably
should. Probably in the garage.

232
00:13:25.054 --> 00:13:26.305
I can go check.
- Okay.

233
00:13:27.556 --> 00:13:29.391
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

234
00:13:52.915 --> 00:13:54.625
What you doing. Cam?

235
00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:56.085
- Katie. what're
you doing in here?

236
00:13:56.085 --> 00:13:58.796
- You're making an awful racket.

237
00:13:58.796 --> 00:14:00.464
I'm
just looking for something.

238
00:14:00.464 --> 00:14:02.007
- Can I help?

239
00:14:02.007 --> 00:14:04.718
- No. just go back inside.
I have to go meet Bryson.

240
00:14:04.718 --> 00:14:06.262
- Can I come?

241
00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:07.972
- No. you'd just be in the way.

242
00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:09.682
- Would not.
- Would too.

243
00:14:09.682 --> 00:14:12.101
Now. go back inside and
play dolls or something.

244
00:14:17.898 --> 00:14:19.108
Why don't you just
go back inside

245
00:14:19.108 --> 00:14:20.609
and see if Anna or Drew
will play with you?

246
00:14:20.609 --> 00:14:25.573
- Anna's at Alison's and
Drew's studying prontons again.

247
00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:26.866
- Protons. Katie.

248
00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:27.700
- Whatever.

249
00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:31.954
- Look. if you go
back inside right now.

250
00:14:31.954 --> 00:14:33.914
I'll play Monopoly
with you later.

251
00:14:33.914 --> 00:14:35.040
- You mean it?

252
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:35.916
- You bet. kiddo.

253
00:14:52.308 --> 00:14:53.809
- What was that Cam said?

254
00:14:58.063 --> 00:14:59.440
I think this was it.

255
00:15:21.837 --> 00:15:22.671
- Bryson!

256
00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:26.884
Bryson?

257
00:15:28.385 --> 00:15:29.345
- Cameron. help me.

258
00:15:36.727 --> 00:15:38.979
Cam. please.

259
00:15:38.979 --> 00:15:39.813
- I can't.

260
00:15:39.813 --> 00:15:40.773
- Please!

261
00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:41.607
Cam!

262
00:15:43.192 --> 00:15:44.026
- I can't!

263
00:16:11.053 --> 00:16:12.471
- I'm sorry. son.

264
00:16:15.724 --> 00:16:16.558
Ma'am.

265
00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.292
- I'm so sorry. Bryson.

266
00:16:42.292 --> 00:16:43.877
I'm so sorry that I failed you.

267
00:16:54.596 --> 00:16:56.432
- Are you okay. honey?

268
00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:00.436
You know I'm always here
for you if you wanna talk.

269
00:17:00.436 --> 00:17:02.938
- Talking won't
change anything. Mom!

270
00:17:02.938 --> 00:17:03.772
Anything.

271
00:17:11.655 --> 00:17:13.115
- I wish you were still here.

272
00:17:16.577 --> 00:17:18.287
You always knew
how to handle him.

273
00:17:22.458 --> 00:17:23.333
Father...

274
00:17:24.376 --> 00:17:27.087
I need your help with Cameron.

275
00:17:28.964 --> 00:17:30.132
Help me!

276
00:17:30.132 --> 00:17:31.091
I can't!

277
00:17:31.091 --> 00:17:32.509
Cam!

278
00:17:32.509 --> 00:17:33.927
I can't. I can't!

279
00:18:14.551 --> 00:18:15.636
- Is something wrong?

280
00:18:17.721 --> 00:18:19.848
- What makes you say that?

281
00:18:19.848 --> 00:18:21.100
- You're drinking milk.

282
00:18:22.017 --> 00:18:23.352
- And?

283
00:18:23.352 --> 00:18:24.686
- You never drink milk.

284
00:18:25.896 --> 00:18:27.147
- I'm fine.

285
00:18:27.147 --> 00:18:28.273
- I don't think so.

286
00:18:29.358 --> 00:18:30.692
- Katie!

287
00:18:30.692 --> 00:18:32.778
I said I'm fine. okay?

288
00:18:32.778 --> 00:18:33.987
Just leave me alone.

289
00:18:33.987 --> 00:18:34.905
- I'm sorry. Cam.

290
00:18:43.872 --> 00:18:46.542
- It's really sweet of
you to offer. Julie.

291
00:18:46.542 --> 00:18:48.794
I'm just not sure
he's ready yet.

292
00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:51.380
Sure. I'll call you
when I know more.

293
00:18:52.297 --> 00:18:54.216
I love you too. sis.

294
00:18:54.216 --> 00:18:55.008
Bye.

295
00:19:02.349 --> 00:19:03.433
Hey. you got a sec?

296
00:19:04.351 --> 00:19:05.394
- I suppose.

297
00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.063
- Aunt Julie just
called and invited you

298
00:19:08.063 --> 00:19:10.357
to spend the remainder
of the summer with them.

299
00:19:11.567 --> 00:19:13.485
I told her I wasn't
sure if you were up

300
00:19:13.485 --> 00:19:15.696
for visiting just yet.
but I'd let her know.

301
00:19:17.531 --> 00:19:18.365
- Okay.

302
00:19:19.241 --> 00:19:20.492
- Is that an "okay. I'll go".

303
00:19:20.492 --> 00:19:22.744
or an "okay. I'll let you know"?

304
00:19:22.744 --> 00:19:23.745
- I'll let you know.

305
00:19:24.746 --> 00:19:25.581
- Okay.

306
00:19:26.748 --> 00:19:29.585
Cam. a change of scenery
might do you some good.

307
00:19:29.585 --> 00:19:30.419
- Maybe.

308
00:19:32.212 --> 00:19:33.589
- Well. goodnight.

309
00:19:34.506 --> 00:19:35.340
I love you.

310
00:19:36.175 --> 00:19:37.009
- Goodnight.

311
00:19:39.136 --> 00:19:41.930
We could use that shed.
- Sounds great to me.

312
00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:43.599
- Where's the fire extinguisher?

313
00:19:43.599 --> 00:19:44.433
- Please.

314
00:19:44.433 --> 00:19:45.267
- I can't!

315
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:08.540
I've gotta get out of here.

316
00:20:15.797 --> 00:20:16.673
Got a sec?

317
00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:21.303
I think that I'll go.

318
00:20:22.137 --> 00:20:24.431
To Aunt Julie's. I mean.

319
00:20:24.431 --> 00:20:26.516
- Okay. I'll call and tell her.

320
00:20:26.516 --> 00:20:27.351
- Thanks.

321
00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:31.021
Oh. and Mom?

322
00:20:32.272 --> 00:20:33.523
The sooner. the better.

323
00:20:34.691 --> 00:20:35.984
- I'll tell her that. too.

324
00:20:38.195 --> 00:20:40.822
You won't
forget me. will you. Cam?

325
00:20:40.822 --> 00:20:43.200
- Don't be silly. It's
only for the summer.

326
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.244
- I'm being serious.

327
00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:47.162
- I won't forget you.

328
00:20:47.162 --> 00:20:48.163
- Will you write?

329
00:20:49.957 --> 00:20:51.375
- Write?

330
00:20:51.375 --> 00:20:52.167
- Call?

331
00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:55.712
- Yeah. I'll call.

332
00:20:59.258 --> 00:21:00.342
Bye. guys.

333
00:21:00.342 --> 00:21:01.718
- Bye.

334
00:21:01.718 --> 00:21:02.886
I'll miss you.

335
00:21:05.347 --> 00:21:06.974
- Okay. we'll see you all later.

336
00:21:06.974 --> 00:21:08.308
Bye.

337
00:21:17.901 --> 00:21:19.528
- Cameron. I'm so sorry
that Justin and Jayden

338
00:21:19.528 --> 00:21:20.862
aren't here to welcome you.

339
00:21:20.862 --> 00:21:22.114
They're at camp until Sunday.

340
00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:23.573
but they'll be home
again on Monday.

341
00:21:23.573 --> 00:21:24.866
- No. that's all
right. Aunt Julie.

342
00:21:24.866 --> 00:21:27.035
I don't really mind
the peace and quiet.

343
00:21:27.035 --> 00:21:29.579
Um. I saw the population
sign back there.

344
00:21:29.579 --> 00:21:31.999
and I was just wondering
if that's a joke.

345
00:21:31.999 --> 00:21:33.834
No.

346
00:21:33.834 --> 00:21:35.419
In fact. it needs to
be updated. right?

347
00:21:35.419 --> 00:21:39.006
Because the Moores
left last year

348
00:21:39.006 --> 00:21:42.050
and they had eight kids?

349
00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:47.014
But the Carters came last
month and they have four kids.

350
00:21:47.889 --> 00:21:49.224
Oh. oh. and you're here now!

351
00:21:49.224 --> 00:21:53.562
So it really should be 961!

352
00:21:53.562 --> 00:21:54.855
Right?

353
00:21:54.855 --> 00:21:56.815
Yeah. don't worry.
You'll get used to it.

354
00:22:02.696 --> 00:22:04.239
- Well. at least it looks nice.

355
00:22:17.794 --> 00:22:18.920
- Good morning. Cameron.

356
00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:19.796
Morning.

357
00:22:22.424 --> 00:22:23.925
- Did you sleep well?

358
00:22:23.925 --> 00:22:25.427
- Yeah.

359
00:22:25.427 --> 00:22:28.263
- It must be that good
clean country air. huh?

360
00:22:29.723 --> 00:22:32.225
Hey. how about we do a
little sightseeing today?

361
00:22:34.061 --> 00:22:35.312
- Sure.

362
00:22:35.312 --> 00:22:36.605
- Good!

363
00:22:36.605 --> 00:22:37.522
Julie?

364
00:22:37.522 --> 00:22:38.607
- You two go on ahead.

365
00:22:39.441 --> 00:22:40.650
- All right!

366
00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:43.612
So. nine AM. I'll
begin introducing you

367
00:22:43.612 --> 00:22:47.449
to the 960 people
of West Prairie.

368
00:22:47.449 --> 00:22:48.825
- Can't wait.
- All right.

369
00:23:03.465 --> 00:23:04.299
- Where are we?

370
00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.638
- West Prairie Investors.
This is where I work.

371
00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:12.974
- West Prairie's big enough
for an investment company?

372
00:23:12.974 --> 00:23:14.976
- Oh. you'd be
surprised. Come on.

373
00:23:16.478 --> 00:23:17.896
- All right. I'll
let Mr. Dorrity know

374
00:23:17.896 --> 00:23:19.439
and he'll be in touch with you.

375
00:23:19.439 --> 00:23:21.691
My pleasure. have a
great day. Goodbye.

376
00:23:23.151 --> 00:23:25.404
Good morning. Mr. Gallagher.
What brings you in today?

377
00:23:25.404 --> 00:23:27.406
- Well. I'm showing
my nephew around

378
00:23:27.406 --> 00:23:28.698
this small town of ours.

379
00:23:28.698 --> 00:23:30.200
Oh. in fact!

380
00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.828
Cameron. this is Elise Thompson.

381
00:23:32.828 --> 00:23:36.581
She is the best secretary
of West Prairie Investors.

382
00:23:36.581 --> 00:23:38.917
And Elise. this is
Cameron Taylor. my nephew.

383
00:23:38.917 --> 00:23:41.002
He's gonna be spending
the summer with us.

384
00:23:41.002 --> 00:23:43.547
- I'm also the only
secretary.

385
00:23:43.547 --> 00:23:46.174
It's good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. too.

386
00:23:46.174 --> 00:23:49.469
How long have you worked here?
- Oh. almost three years.

387
00:23:49.469 --> 00:23:51.179
- Oh. and thankfully
she's not done yet.

388
00:23:51.179 --> 00:23:54.641
because her fiance had the
good sense to stay put.

389
00:23:54.641 --> 00:23:56.268
here in West Prairie.

390
00:23:56.268 --> 00:23:57.686
I don't know what we
would do without her.

391
00:23:57.686 --> 00:24:00.522
- You know. I could be
replaced. Mr. Gallagher.

392
00:24:00.522 --> 00:24:02.732
but for now. I'm staying.

393
00:24:02.732 --> 00:24:04.192
- When are you getting married?

394
00:24:04.192 --> 00:24:06.361
- September.
- Congratulations.

395
00:24:06.361 --> 00:24:08.780

is missing the
signature of Mrs...

397
00:24:12.951 --> 00:24:14.995
Hello. Phil. Who's your friend?

398
00:24:14.995 --> 00:24:17.873

400
00:24:22.461 --> 00:24:23.962

401
00:24:23.962 --> 00:24:25.505

404
00:24:29.509 --> 00:24:31.052

407
00:24:54.951 --> 00:24:55.911
Why today?

408
00:25:04.586 --> 00:25:05.837
- Cameron. are you awake?

409
00:25:07.214 --> 00:25:08.048
- Mm-mm.

410
00:25:09.424 --> 00:25:11.259
- Are you planning to
attend the parade with us?

411
00:25:13.261 --> 00:25:14.721
- Mm-mm.

412
00:25:14.721 --> 00:25:16.014
- All right.

413
00:25:16.014 --> 00:25:17.224
We're just about ready to leave

414
00:25:17.224 --> 00:25:19.601
and I'll put your
breakfast in the fridge.

415
00:25:19.601 --> 00:25:21.186
- Thanks.

416
00:25:21.186 --> 00:25:22.604
- See you in a bit.
- Mm-hm.

417
00:25:46.461 --> 00:25:49.130
- Hey. you gonna be joining
us for fireworks tonight?

418
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:51.383
- No. sir.

419
00:25:53.176 --> 00:25:54.010
- Okay.

420
00:25:55.428 --> 00:25:57.013
Well. we're gonna be back late.

421
00:25:57.013 --> 00:25:59.808
so why don't you make
yourself at home?

422
00:25:59.808 --> 00:26:00.642
- Thanks.

423
00:27:04.289 --> 00:27:05.999
So. Uncle Phil took
me to his office

424
00:27:05.999 --> 00:27:08.627
and introduced me to
two of his coworkers.

425
00:27:08.627 --> 00:27:11.046
And then he took me on
a tour through town.

426
00:27:11.046 --> 00:27:12.047
- What did you see?

427
00:27:13.423 --> 00:27:16.718
- Well. there's a gas
station. two grocery stores.

428
00:27:16.718 --> 00:27:20.221
a restaurant. a library and
Uncle Phil's investment firm.

429
00:27:21.181 --> 00:27:22.349
- That's it?

430
00:27:22.349 --> 00:27:25.060
- Uh. well. there's
two churches.

431
00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:26.603
Oh. and get this.

432
00:27:26.603 --> 00:27:28.688
The entering West Prairie sign
and exiting West Prairie sign

433
00:27:28.688 --> 00:27:29.731
are one and the same.

434
00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:34.569
No. I'm not being serious about
that part. but it is small.

435
00:27:37.906 --> 00:27:39.491
Uncle Phil has some horses. too.

436
00:27:41.743 --> 00:27:44.454
No. I cannot bring
that home in my suitcase.

437
00:27:45.747 --> 00:27:48.041
Yeah. I can send
you some pictures.

438
00:27:48.041 --> 00:27:48.875
Oh. hold on.

439
00:27:50.293 --> 00:27:54.673
A car just pulled up. I think
Justin and Jayden are back.

440
00:27:54.673 --> 00:27:55.757
All right. I gotta go.

441
00:27:56.925 --> 00:27:58.885
All right. I love you too.

442
00:27:58.885 --> 00:27:59.719
Bye.

443
00:28:03.598 --> 00:28:05.141
Hi. guys.

444
00:28:05.141 --> 00:28:06.726
- Hey. Long time no see.

445
00:28:07.602 --> 00:28:09.145
- Yeah. it's been like what.

446
00:28:09.145 --> 00:28:10.647
two years or
somethin' like that?

447
00:28:10.647 --> 00:28:13.233
- Too long. whenever it
was. When'd you get here?

448
00:28:13.233 --> 00:28:14.901
- Thursday night.

449
00:28:14.901 --> 00:28:16.653
- Did Dad take you
sightseeing yet?

450
00:28:16.653 --> 00:28:19.739
- Uh. yes. Quite the
small town you got here.

451
00:28:19.739 --> 00:28:21.908
- Spoken like a true
city boy. huh. Jayden?

452
00:28:23.159 --> 00:28:26.121
Well. anyway. we're
glad you're here though.

453
00:28:26.121 --> 00:28:28.123
Well. let's get this
baggage outta here.

454
00:28:29.457 --> 00:28:31.793
Well. see you later.
- All right.

455
00:28:31.793 --> 00:28:33.128
- See you later.
- See ya.

456
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:37.173
- Cameron. Uncle Phil
forgot his lunch.

457
00:28:37.173 --> 00:28:38.800
Would you run it to him for me?

458
00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:39.634
- Yeah. sure.

459
00:28:40.802 --> 00:28:42.387
- Thank you. dear.
- No problem.

460
00:28:45.473 --> 00:28:46.474
Yeah.

461
00:28:48.935 --> 00:28:50.437
Cameron. good morning!

462
00:28:50.437 --> 00:28:52.063
Um. how are you?

463
00:28:52.063 --> 00:28:54.482
- I'm good. how are you?
- Just fine. thanks.

464
00:28:54.482 --> 00:28:56.443
Cameron. this is my
fiance. Micah Stanton.

465
00:28:56.443 --> 00:28:59.112
Micah. this is Mr. Gallagher's
nephew. Cameron Taylor.

466
00:28:59.112 --> 00:29:00.822
- I've been hearing quite
a bit about you. Cameron.

467
00:29:00.822 --> 00:29:03.158
It's good to finally meet you.
- Nice to meet you. too.

468
00:29:03.158 --> 00:29:04.659
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

469
00:29:04.659 --> 00:29:06.202
- Oh. no.

470
00:29:06.202 --> 00:29:08.329
Micah was just bringing by
some coffee for my break.

471
00:29:08.329 --> 00:29:09.831
Can I help you with anything?

472
00:29:09.831 --> 00:29:12.500
- Uh. Aunt Julie told me to
drop this off for Uncle Phil.

473
00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.043
It's just his lunch.

474
00:29:14.043 --> 00:29:15.211
- I can take it for ya.

475
00:29:20.884 --> 00:29:24.179
- All right. well. I should
probably get going. so...

476
00:29:24.179 --> 00:29:25.555
- Hey. uh. Cameron?

477
00:29:27.015 --> 00:29:31.394
We were hoping. um. if you
think you'd be interested.

478
00:29:31.394 --> 00:29:34.314
we'd really love to have you
join us for church sometime.

479
00:29:34.314 --> 00:29:35.148
- Oh! Um...

480
00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.069

481
00:29:40.069 --> 00:29:41.780
But. but no. so...

482
00:29:42.697 --> 00:29:43.740
- Take care. Cameron.

483
00:29:46.618 --> 00:29:48.036
I wonder what's up with him.

484
00:29:55.418 --> 00:29:57.378

485
00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:01.674

00:30:05.094 --> 00:30:07.096
Elise's younger brother.

488
00:30:07.096 --> 00:30:08.723
Are you a photographer?

489
00:30:08.723 --> 00:30:11.184
- It's honestly just a hobby.
Do you live around here?

490
00:30:11.184 --> 00:30:13.728

00:30:36.584 --> 00:30:40.129

500
00:30:40.129 --> 00:30:41.422
- Coffee?

501
00:30:41.422 --> 00:30:42.841
- Don't tell me you
aren't a coffee drinker.

502
00:30:42.841 --> 00:30:44.259
- No. I mean...

503
00:30:44.259 --> 00:30:47.762
I mean. yes. I. I'm
a coffee drinker.

504
00:30:47.762 --> 00:30:48.930

tomorrow for a
picnic at the lake.

514
00:31:17.292 --> 00:31:18.585
Uncle Alan's coming. too.

515
00:31:19.419 --> 00:31:20.962
- Oh. um...

516
00:31:20.962 --> 00:31:22.630
I don't wanna
impose or anything.

517
00:31:24.591 --> 00:31:27.302
I'm not the most social
person in the world.

518
00:31:27.302 --> 00:31:28.845
- Don't worry.
You're not imposing.

519
00:31:28.845 --> 00:31:30.346
Besides. if you
don't wanna talk.

520
00:31:30.346 --> 00:31:32.307
you can just sit
there. eat cookies.

521
00:31:32.307 --> 00:31:33.892
listen to us talk. if you want.

522
00:31:35.101 --> 00:31:38.271
In all seriousness. we'd
really like to have you.

523
00:31:38.271 --> 00:31:39.981
- You know what. how about I
give you a call in the morning

524
00:31:39.981 --> 00:31:41.941
and I can let you know?
- Perfect.

525
00:31:47.655 --> 00:31:48.448
Cameron?

526
00:31:49.657 --> 00:31:51.409
There's something I've
been meaning to ask you.

527
00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:53.703
- What's that?

528
00:31:53.703 --> 00:31:55.830
- What exactly brought
you to West Prairie?

529
00:31:58.041 --> 00:31:59.584
- I have family here. don't I?

530
00:31:59.584 --> 00:32:01.836
- Well. sure. but-
- Then that's why I'm here.

531
00:32:06.215 --> 00:32:09.802
Thanks for the invite. Jonah.
but I should get going.

532
00:32:09.802 --> 00:32:11.679
- My pleasure.
Thanks for coming.

533
00:32:23.775 --> 00:32:25.860
- I'm so sorry.
- No. it was my fault.

534
00:32:27.612 --> 00:32:30.531
Are you okay?
- Yeah. just fine. thank you.

535
00:32:30.531 --> 00:32:31.699
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

536
00:32:34.702 --> 00:32:36.204
- Have a nice day.
- You too.

537
00:32:38.665 --> 00:32:40.124
- Morning. Cameron.

538
00:32:40.124 --> 00:32:43.544
I noticed your meeting with
Mikayla was a smashing success.

539
00:32:43.544 --> 00:32:45.171
- Yeah. who is she anyways?

540
00:32:45.171 --> 00:32:47.006
Is she a friend of
yours or something?

541
00:32:47.006 --> 00:32:48.508
- She's one of the
girls I mentor.

542
00:32:48.508 --> 00:32:50.510
I asked her to come
by on my break.

543
00:32:53.221 --> 00:32:54.555
How was coffee with Jonah?

544
00:32:59.727 --> 00:33:01.771
- Is there anything
I can help you with?

545
00:33:04.357 --> 00:33:05.566
- I don't know.

546
00:33:07.819 --> 00:33:10.446
What time does Uncle
Phil get off of work?

547
00:33:11.406 --> 00:33:12.240
- 4:30.

548
00:33:13.574 --> 00:33:14.409
- Okay. thanks.

549
00:33:16.452 --> 00:33:17.286
- Cameron?

550
00:33:19.288 --> 00:33:23.084
Are you okay?

551
00:33:23.084 --> 00:33:23.918
- No.

552
00:33:27.463 --> 00:33:28.423
I gotta go.

553
00:33:48.943 --> 00:33:50.111
- Hey. you want a ride?

554
00:33:51.612 --> 00:33:52.447
- Yeah. sure.

555
00:34:03.875 --> 00:34:06.919
So. what brings
you out this time of day?

556
00:34:06.919 --> 00:34:08.379
- Well. I had coffee with Jonah.

557
00:34:08.379 --> 00:34:11.299
and then I went around
town and saw some sights.

558
00:34:11.299 --> 00:34:13.634
- Find anything spectacular?

559
00:34:13.634 --> 00:34:15.053
- Not really.

560
00:34:15.053 --> 00:34:17.930
- Tomorrow. Jonah.
Elise. Micah and I

561
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:20.141
are gonna go for a
picnic on the lake.

562
00:34:20.141 --> 00:34:21.684
You're welcome to join us.

563
00:34:21.684 --> 00:34:23.144
- Thanks.

564
00:34:23.144 --> 00:34:25.354
Jonah already invited me
but I'm supposed to call him

565
00:34:25.354 --> 00:34:27.273
tomorrow. let him know
if I'm coming or not.

566
00:34:27.273 --> 00:34:28.775
- Well. we'd love to have you.

567
00:34:33.321 --> 00:34:35.865
- Thanks for the ride.
- You're welcome. any time.

568
00:34:40.828 --> 00:34:41.662
Hey. Cameron.

569
00:34:43.539 --> 00:34:47.001
If you ever need anything.
come see me. okay?

570
00:34:47.001 --> 00:34:49.045
- You mean at the office?
- Yes. or at my house.

571
00:34:49.045 --> 00:34:51.172
It's the last one
on Cessford Drive.

572
00:34:51.172 --> 00:34:53.007
My door is always open to you.

573
00:34:53.007 --> 00:34:53.841
- Okay. thanks.

574
00:34:55.426 --> 00:34:56.219
- Always.

575
00:35:03.726 --> 00:35:05.853
- Hey. Cameron. Where you been?

576
00:35:05.853 --> 00:35:07.271
- Well. I was out looking around

577
00:35:07.271 --> 00:35:09.190
and then Mr. Dorrity
offered me a ride back home.

578
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:11.317
Yeah.
that sounds like Alan.

579
00:35:11.317 --> 00:35:13.694
He's the best partner
I could've asked for.

580
00:35:13.694 --> 00:35:15.988
Good man. He knows his stuff.

581
00:35:17.198 --> 00:35:18.491
- He seems nice enough.

582
00:35:18.491 --> 00:35:20.701
- Nice? He's more than nice.

583
00:35:20.701 --> 00:35:22.745
A more honest man.
I've never met.

584
00:35:22.745 --> 00:35:24.914
You can trust him with anything.

585
00:35:24.914 --> 00:35:26.165
- I don't know.

586
00:35:26.165 --> 00:35:27.750
He's kinda crazy though.
Dad. Don't you think?

587
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:28.709
- Crazy?

588
00:35:28.709 --> 00:35:31.754
- Well. he's not exactly crazy.

589
00:35:31.754 --> 00:35:34.173
but he is one of those
religious fanatics.

590
00:35:34.173 --> 00:35:36.342
- You mean a Christian?

591
00:35:36.342 --> 00:35:37.844
- Whatever you wanna call 'em.

592
00:35:37.844 --> 00:35:40.721
Always lookin' on the bright
side and talking about

593
00:35:40.721 --> 00:35:43.349
an invisible God
and that Jesus guy.

594
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:46.060
- And you ended up with
two of them as coworkers.

595
00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:48.396
I don't
know how that happened.

596
00:35:48.396 --> 00:35:49.856
But I tell ya. Alan and Elise

597
00:35:49.856 --> 00:35:52.733
are two of the best people
I've ever worked with.

598
00:35:52.733 --> 00:35:55.403
I just take everything with
a grain of salt. you know?

599
00:35:55.403 --> 00:35:58.406
I appreciate their hard work.

600
00:35:58.406 --> 00:36:01.534
but I tell 'em to leave
their religion alone with me.

601
00:36:03.452 --> 00:36:05.538
No. I wouldn't pay
their religious talk

602
00:36:05.538 --> 00:36:07.331
too much mind. Cameron.

603
00:36:07.331 --> 00:36:08.708
It's not worth the hassle.

604
00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:14.672
- And Jesus. we're just so
grateful this time together.

605
00:36:14.672 --> 00:36:16.757
Thank you for this food
we're about to enjoy.

606
00:36:16.757 --> 00:36:18.801
and thank you that
Cameron could join us.

607
00:36:20.052 --> 00:36:22.889
- Hey. Micah. you should
tell Cameron that joke.

608
00:36:22.889 --> 00:36:23.681
- Okay.

609
00:36:25.099 --> 00:36:27.602
I admit I was wrong about
how good my chiropractor is.

610
00:36:27.602 --> 00:36:28.895
I stand corrected.

611
00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:33.357
- Here. let me get a photo.
- Oh. yeah. great.

612
00:36:35.735 --> 00:36:40.489
- As my adopted niece
from China says...

613
00:36:41.657 --> 00:36:43.618
Which means "eggplant".

614
00:36:49.498 --> 00:36:50.750
- Thank you for
everything. Mr. Dorrity.

615
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:52.501
- It was our pleasure.

616
00:36:52.501 --> 00:36:57.048
- Mr. Dorrity? Why
do the Thompson kids
call you Uncle Alan?

617
00:36:57.048 --> 00:36:59.217
Are you related somehow?

618
00:36:59.217 --> 00:37:00.259
- No. we're not.

619
00:37:01.636 --> 00:37:04.972
Most of the young people around
West Prairie call me that.

620
00:37:04.972 --> 00:37:07.808
I never had any
children of my own. so.

621
00:37:08.851 --> 00:37:10.269
I adopt nieces and nephews.

622
00:37:11.896 --> 00:37:14.982
- Okay. Well. I was
just wondering. so
I'll see you later.

623
00:37:16.275 --> 00:37:17.068
- Take care.

624
00:37:18.736 --> 00:37:20.404
- Good morning.
- Morning.

625
00:37:21.739 --> 00:37:23.115
How'd you sleep?

626
00:37:23.115 --> 00:37:25.159
- Good. You?

627
00:37:25.159 --> 00:37:25.993
- Good.

628
00:37:27.662 --> 00:37:31.999
- So. my girlfriend Skyler is
having a party tomorrow night.

629
00:37:32.959 --> 00:37:33.793
You wanna come?

630
00:37:37.129 --> 00:37:38.839
- What kind of party?

631
00:37:38.839 --> 00:37:40.174
- Just. just a party.

632
00:37:41.926 --> 00:37:43.552
- I don't know.

633
00:37:43.552 --> 00:37:46.430
- Come on. Where's your
sense of adventure?

634
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:47.974
- Who said I had one?

635
00:37:47.974 --> 00:37:52.478
- Probably forgot to pack it
in your suitcase.

636
00:37:52.478 --> 00:37:53.896
So what do you say?

637
00:37:53.896 --> 00:37:55.898
Tomorrow night. seven o'clock?

638
00:37:55.898 --> 00:37:57.400
Let's go.

639
00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:00.111
- Just what do you plan
on doing at this party?

640
00:38:00.111 --> 00:38:02.697
- Just what you do at any party.

641
00:38:02.697 --> 00:38:05.741
Just talk to some people. eat.

642
00:38:07.034 --> 00:38:07.868
- And drink?

643
00:38:09.203 --> 00:38:10.913
- It wouldn't be
a party otherwise.

644
00:38:12.039 --> 00:38:13.416
- Thanks. but no thanks.

645
00:38:15.793 --> 00:38:16.627
- Okay.

646
00:38:17.712 --> 00:38:18.546
Whatever.

647
00:38:21.173 --> 00:38:22.008
You know. Cam.

648
00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:25.386
You're a real well-behaved kid.

649
00:38:25.386 --> 00:38:27.763
but you're kind
of a momma's boy.

650
00:38:28.889 --> 00:38:31.058
It's about time you manned up.

651
00:38:31.058 --> 00:38:32.143
See ya.

652
00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.024
- All righty. I'll forward
your message to Mr. Gallagher

653
00:38:38.024 --> 00:38:40.192
and he'll be in
contact with you.

654
00:38:40.192 --> 00:38:42.403
Thank you so much.
Have a great day.

655
00:38:45.406 --> 00:38:47.408
Can I help you with
somethin'. Mr. Taylor?

656
00:38:47.408 --> 00:38:50.077
- I was just seeing
if Mr. Dorrity was in?

657
00:38:50.077 --> 00:38:51.579
- Yeah. he's here.

658
00:38:51.579 --> 00:38:54.415
He's in a meeting right
now. but he should be out in

659
00:38:54.415 --> 00:38:56.417
the next couple of minutes.

660
00:38:56.417 --> 00:38:57.585
Excuse me for a moment.

661
00:38:59.295 --> 00:39:01.130
Thanks for calling
West Prairie Investors.

662
00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:02.923
This is Elise speaking.

663
00:39:02.923 --> 00:39:04.967
Oh. hello. Mr. Bridges.

664
00:39:04.967 --> 00:39:06.761
Yes. of course.

665
00:39:06.761 --> 00:39:08.929
No. it's no problem
at all. Goodbye.

666
00:39:11.432 --> 00:39:12.892
- I'll get in touch
with both of you

667
00:39:12.892 --> 00:39:15.728
once I've had a chance to
analyze your financial profile.

668
00:39:15.728 --> 00:39:16.937
- When can we expect
to hear from you?

669
00:39:16.937 --> 00:39:18.439
- By Monday.

670
00:39:18.439 --> 00:39:20.149
I'll have Elise set up a
meeting and we can discuss

671
00:39:20.149 --> 00:39:23.778
your financial objectives
and goals in greater detail.

672
00:39:23.778 --> 00:39:25.237
- Thank you so much. Al.
- Mm-hm.

673
00:39:25.237 --> 00:39:26.947
- Yes. thank you.
- My pleasure.

674
00:39:26.947 --> 00:39:28.783
Now. you have yourselves
a wonderful rest

675
00:39:28.783 --> 00:39:31.077
of this beautiful day.

676
00:39:31.077 --> 00:39:33.954
Days like this make
me wish I could get off early.

677
00:39:35.414 --> 00:39:38.376
Cameron! I'm so sorry. I
didn't even see you there.

678
00:39:38.376 --> 00:39:40.378
How are you. son?
- I'm doing all right.

679
00:39:40.378 --> 00:39:42.046
I. um...

680
00:39:42.046 --> 00:39:45.091
I was just wondering if
you've got some time to talk.

681
00:39:45.091 --> 00:39:46.592
- What time's the
next one. Elise?

682
00:39:46.592 --> 00:39:47.885
You're done
for the day. Uncle.

683
00:39:47.885 --> 00:39:49.512
- Really now!

684
00:39:49.512 --> 00:39:52.098
Well then. Cameron. I've got
all the time in the world.

685
00:39:52.098 --> 00:39:53.641
Come on back to the
office. We can talk there.

686
00:39:53.641 --> 00:39:54.975
Okay.

687
00:39:54.975 --> 00:39:56.894
- All right. see you
soon. Bye. Micah.

688
00:40:08.823 --> 00:40:12.159
Uncle. I set an appointment
for you with Mr. White

689
00:40:12.159 --> 00:40:15.413
tomorrow at 3:30 for
a 15 minute slot.

690
00:40:15.413 --> 00:40:16.997
- Perfect.
- All right.

691
00:40:16.997 --> 00:40:18.290
Thank you. Elise.

692
00:40:19.375 --> 00:40:20.668
- Have a good
evening. gentlemen.

693
00:40:25.381 --> 00:40:26.215
- Hey. Elise?

694
00:40:33.055 --> 00:40:34.432
Hey. Elise?

695
00:40:34.432 --> 00:40:35.558
Wait.

696
00:40:35.558 --> 00:40:36.392
- What?

697
00:40:37.685 --> 00:40:39.770
- You dropped this.

698
00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:40.521
Oh.

699
00:40:45.943 --> 00:40:47.236
- Are you okay?

700
00:40:47.236 --> 00:40:49.572
Yeah. Yeah. I'm okay.

701
00:40:50.781 --> 00:40:52.158
Um...

702
00:40:52.158 --> 00:40:54.326
Thank you so much.

703
00:40:54.326 --> 00:40:57.705
This letter is. uh.
very valuable to me.

704
00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:00.749
- Yeah.

705
00:41:00.749 --> 00:41:02.168
- I'll see you later. Cameron.

706
00:41:13.554 --> 00:41:15.222
- Mr. Dorrity?

707
00:41:15.222 --> 00:41:16.223
- Back here!

708
00:41:20.728 --> 00:41:23.481
Did you get whatever
it was back to Elise?

709
00:41:23.481 --> 00:41:24.899
- Yeah. but it was really weird.

710
00:41:24.899 --> 00:41:25.733
- How so?

711
00:41:27.193 --> 00:41:30.404
- It was postmarked by a Kyle
Thompson in the US military?

712
00:41:30.404 --> 00:41:31.238
Who is he?

713
00:41:33.908 --> 00:41:34.742
- Her father.

714
00:41:36.535 --> 00:41:38.162
- Elise's dad is
in the military?

715
00:41:39.288 --> 00:41:40.122
- He was.

716
00:41:42.082 --> 00:41:44.251
- Wait. what do you mean he was?

717
00:41:49.798 --> 00:41:51.634
- I think you should
ask Elise about that.

718
00:41:56.222 --> 00:41:58.724
- Hey. Where is everyone?

719
00:41:58.724 --> 00:42:00.809
- Dad's at work. Mom
ran to the store.

720
00:42:00.809 --> 00:42:03.103
and Justin's with Skyler.

721
00:42:03.103 --> 00:42:04.939
- Should've guessed.
- Hm?

722
00:42:04.939 --> 00:42:06.440
- Nothing.

723
00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:08.400
- So. it's just me
and you for lunch.

724
00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.194
Hope you like peanut
butter and jelly.

725
00:42:10.194 --> 00:42:11.403
- Yeah. sure. Thanks.

726
00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:22.790
- So. got any plans
for this afternoon?

727
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:24.291
- I was just thinking
about heading into town

728
00:42:24.291 --> 00:42:25.751
to take some pictures.

729
00:42:25.751 --> 00:42:26.585
- Oh.

730
00:42:27.419 --> 00:42:28.254
- Why?

731
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:30.923
- I was just wondering
if you wanted to come out

732
00:42:30.923 --> 00:42:32.508
to the woods with me.

733
00:42:32.508 --> 00:42:34.301
- Oh. um...

734
00:42:35.135 --> 00:42:36.637
I don't think so.

735
00:42:36.637 --> 00:42:38.764
- Why not? Are you chicken?

736
00:42:38.764 --> 00:42:40.140
- No.

737
00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:42.101
- Then why not?

738
00:42:43.644 --> 00:42:46.188
- I just. I don't
feel like it. okay?

739
00:42:46.188 --> 00:42:48.649
- But I can't go without
adult supervision.

740
00:42:48.649 --> 00:42:50.442
- Why not? It's just the woods.

741
00:42:50.442 --> 00:42:51.527
- Mom and Dad's rules.

742
00:42:54.446 --> 00:42:57.241
- Look. I don't mean to
spoil your fun and all.

743
00:42:58.617 --> 00:43:00.452
but I just can't.

744
00:43:04.665 --> 00:43:06.917
Thanks for the sandwich. cuz.
- Yeah. sure.

745
00:43:08.669 --> 00:43:09.878
You know what. Cam?

746
00:43:11.046 --> 00:43:12.464
I don't know if
it has to do with

747
00:43:12.464 --> 00:43:14.967
you losing your best
friend earlier this summer.

748
00:43:14.967 --> 00:43:17.177
but you're not as fun
as you used to be.

749
00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:22.182
- I'll see you later.

750
00:43:35.571 --> 00:43:37.656
- Cameron. Mr. Dorrity's
in a meeting right now.

751
00:43:37.656 --> 00:43:39.241
but he should be done soon.

752
00:43:39.241 --> 00:43:42.411
Actually. I didn't
come here to see him today.

753
00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:44.997
I came to see you.

754
00:43:44.997 --> 00:43:47.916
- Me?
- Well. I mean. I...

755
00:43:47.916 --> 00:43:51.337
I wanted to ask you something.
if you have a moment.

756
00:43:51.337 --> 00:43:52.254
- Yeah. I do.

757
00:43:57.509 --> 00:44:00.596
- Well. you see. it's...

758
00:44:00.596 --> 00:44:03.807
It's about the envelope
that you dropped on Friday.

759
00:44:03.807 --> 00:44:08.771
I couldn't help but to see
the military postmark on it.

760
00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:10.939
And the sender's name.

761
00:44:11.899 --> 00:44:13.275
I asked Mr. Dorrity.

762
00:44:14.735 --> 00:44:17.571
and he said that it
was from your father.

763
00:44:19.281 --> 00:44:20.115
- That's right.

764
00:44:22.743 --> 00:44:25.579
- He said that your
father was military.

765
00:44:25.579 --> 00:44:26.413
- Yeah.

766
00:44:27.748 --> 00:44:28.582
- Well...

767
00:44:30.459 --> 00:44:32.336
He said "was".

768
00:44:33.379 --> 00:44:34.922
Not "is".

769
00:44:34.922 --> 00:44:37.216
And I was just
wondering. why is that?

770
00:44:39.009 --> 00:44:41.053
I mean. I asked Mr. Dorrity.

771
00:44:42.763 --> 00:44:45.391
but he told me that
I should ask you.

772
00:44:47.309 --> 00:44:50.270
- He said "was". Cameron.

773
00:44:51.689 --> 00:44:53.899
because my father
died in Afghanistan

774
00:44:53.899 --> 00:44:55.526
in combat 10 years ago.

775
00:44:58.904 --> 00:45:02.783
That letter was the last one
I received from him as a kid.

776
00:45:04.118 --> 00:45:07.079
It was written the
night before he died.

777
00:45:11.417 --> 00:45:13.085
- I'm so sorry.

778
00:45:13.085 --> 00:45:14.586
Thanks.

779
00:45:18.549 --> 00:45:19.758
I still think about him.

780
00:45:21.969 --> 00:45:26.181
I can remember his
laugh and his smile.

781
00:45:27.975 --> 00:45:31.353
And his voice. when he
would read the Bible to me.

782
00:45:35.357 --> 00:45:38.819
And the last time
he hugged me.

783
00:45:41.697 --> 00:45:43.323
- Does it ever make you mad?

784
00:45:44.658 --> 00:45:45.826
- No.

785
00:45:45.826 --> 00:45:46.660
Not anymore.

786
00:45:48.787 --> 00:45:49.747
It used to. though.

787
00:45:51.999 --> 00:45:54.710
I didn't think it was fair
of God to take him from me.

788
00:45:56.837 --> 00:45:59.840
And it took me years
to learn to be grateful

789
00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:01.425
for the time that
I had with him.

790
00:46:02.718 --> 00:46:05.512
instead of agonizing
over the years I didn't.

791
00:46:07.765 --> 00:46:10.684
- So you don't hate
God for taking him?

792
00:46:11.685 --> 00:46:12.519
- Not at all.

793
00:46:14.521 --> 00:46:17.441
My dad died because he jumped
in front of his friend.

794
00:46:17.441 --> 00:46:18.734
to save his friend's life.

795
00:46:21.487 --> 00:46:22.446
He's a hero.

796
00:46:27.034 --> 00:46:28.202
Mr. Dorrity?

797
00:46:30.329 --> 00:46:31.163
Yeah?

798
00:46:33.707 --> 00:46:34.917
- How can you believe in God?

799
00:46:34.917 --> 00:46:37.377
- Well. what do you mean. son?

800
00:46:37.377 --> 00:46:39.630
- How can you believe
in a loving God?

801
00:46:42.549 --> 00:46:44.051
- You don't believe
in him. then?

802
00:46:44.051 --> 00:46:44.885
- No. sir.

803
00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:47.054
I can't.

804
00:46:49.056 --> 00:46:50.724
- I think the best way
to answer your question

805
00:46:50.724 --> 00:46:51.850
is by asking you one.

806
00:46:53.018 --> 00:46:54.102
Why don't you believe?

807
00:46:55.103 --> 00:46:56.730
- You really wanna know?
- I do.

808
00:46:58.941 --> 00:47:02.653
- Last month. my best
friend. Bryson. died.

809
00:47:02.653 --> 00:47:04.655
Because the fireworks
that we were working on

810
00:47:04.655 --> 00:47:05.739
accidentally went off.

811
00:47:06.949 --> 00:47:09.409
Can you tell me
how that is loving?

812
00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:12.830
- I'm afraid I can't.

813
00:47:14.289 --> 00:47:18.710
I don't know why God would
take your best friend.

814
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:22.089
but I do know this.

815
00:47:22.089 --> 00:47:26.343
God works all things out to
the good for those who love him

816
00:47:26.343 --> 00:47:29.388
and those who are called
according to his purposes.

817
00:47:30.597 --> 00:47:33.433
But we're not guaranteed
to know the good

818
00:47:33.433 --> 00:47:34.518
this side of eternity.

819
00:47:36.854 --> 00:47:37.938
- It was all my fault.

820
00:47:39.398 --> 00:47:40.774
- What do you mean? I thought
you said it was an accident?

821
00:47:40.774 --> 00:47:43.402
- It was. but I
could've saved Bryson.

822
00:47:44.528 --> 00:47:46.446
I dropped the fire
extinguisher outside.

823
00:47:48.699 --> 00:47:50.200
- So you are saying-

824
00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:53.287
- Bryson died because I didn't
act when I had the one thing

825
00:47:53.287 --> 00:47:56.582
that could save his
life in my hands.

826
00:47:56.582 --> 00:47:59.668
I turned and ran
like the coward I am.

827
00:48:01.628 --> 00:48:04.464
My dad would be ashamed of me.

828
00:48:04.464 --> 00:48:08.093
- Why do you say that?
- My father was a firefighter.

829
00:48:08.093 --> 00:48:11.513
He rushed into burning buildings
to save people's lives.

830
00:48:13.307 --> 00:48:15.183
And what did his son do?

831
00:48:15.183 --> 00:48:16.476
He turned and ran.

832
00:48:17.769 --> 00:48:19.146
How's that for a story?

833
00:48:19.146 --> 00:48:20.981
- It doesn't have to end there.

834
00:48:20.981 --> 00:48:22.858
- What do you mean?

835
00:48:22.858 --> 00:48:24.735
The story's done. finished!

836
00:48:24.735 --> 00:48:27.654
Bryson's gone. and
it's all my fault.

837
00:48:29.072 --> 00:48:33.160
- Bryson's story on this earth
is over. but yours is not.

838
00:48:34.328 --> 00:48:36.747
Life is not defined
by one mistake.

839
00:48:38.415 --> 00:48:40.667
- Nothing can fix
the mess I've made.

840
00:48:44.004 --> 00:48:44.838
- You're right.

841
00:48:46.256 --> 00:48:47.090
Nothing can.

842
00:48:50.218 --> 00:48:51.345
Only someone.

843
00:48:52.638 --> 00:48:53.597
- You mean...

844
00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:55.974
Jesus.

845
00:48:57.142 --> 00:49:00.228
- If you repent and
put your trust in him.

846
00:49:00.228 --> 00:49:02.648
your life will be
totally changed.

847
00:49:04.691 --> 00:49:07.069
Cameron. would you be open
to meeting with me weekly?

848
00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:09.863
Going through scripture? I
could answers your questions.

849
00:49:14.076 --> 00:49:14.910
- I'd like that.

850
00:49:23.168 --> 00:49:24.002
For me?

851
00:49:26.129 --> 00:49:27.547
- You'll put it to good use.

852
00:49:52.406 --> 00:49:55.575
Cameron Taylor.
what is going on?

853
00:49:55.575 --> 00:49:56.702
- I saw your light on.

854
00:49:57.786 --> 00:49:58.620
- Come in.

855
00:50:03.417 --> 00:50:04.751
I just made a pot of tea.

856
00:50:06.753 --> 00:50:08.255
You want a cup?

857
00:50:08.255 --> 00:50:09.089
- Yes. please.

858
00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:13.510
- Grab a seat on the couch.
You want any cream or sugar?

859
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:14.928
- Uh. one sugar. please.

860
00:50:23.103 --> 00:50:24.563
Thank you.

861
00:50:24.563 --> 00:50:25.397
- You're welcome.

862
00:50:26.815 --> 00:50:30.318
Now. tell me what you were
doing on my front porch

863
00:50:30.318 --> 00:50:31.778
at half-past midnight.

864
00:50:32.946 --> 00:50:34.781
- I had a question.

865
00:50:34.781 --> 00:50:37.492
Oh. when I
said we could get together

866
00:50:37.492 --> 00:50:38.869
and I'd answer your questions.

867
00:50:38.869 --> 00:50:41.288
midnight wasn't exactly
what I had in mind.

868
00:50:41.288 --> 00:50:45.125
- I know. I know. but I'm
sorry. this just couldn't wait.

869
00:50:45.125 --> 00:50:47.627
- I'll let it pass this
time. What's your question?

870
00:50:48.837 --> 00:50:52.049
- It's about one of
the verses. It said...

871
00:50:53.508 --> 00:50:55.969
"For God so loved the world

872
00:50:55.969 --> 00:50:58.889
that he gave his
only begotten son

873
00:50:58.889 --> 00:51:02.809
so that who has ever believed
in him would not perish

874
00:51:02.809 --> 00:51:05.479
but have everlasting life."

875
00:51:05.479 --> 00:51:10.484
And you see. I mean. I know all
about Jesus dying and stuff.

876
00:51:11.651 --> 00:51:15.405
but I don't see how
that shows his love.

877
00:51:15.405 --> 00:51:17.824
or how that could
apply to me because

878
00:51:17.824 --> 00:51:19.826
I sure haven't seen
his love in my life.

879
00:51:19.826 --> 00:51:22.621
- I wouldn't be too sure
about that. Let me show you.

880
00:51:24.456 --> 00:51:28.877
Right at the start in Genesis 1.

881
00:51:28.877 --> 00:51:32.380
we see God creating everything.

882
00:51:36.051 --> 00:51:37.344
Thanks
for explaining.

883
00:51:37.344 --> 00:51:39.346
- You're welcome. Any time.

884
00:51:39.346 --> 00:51:41.598
But if you. uh.

885
00:51:41.598 --> 00:51:44.017
are gonna come at midnight
again. just get permission.

886
00:51:44.017 --> 00:51:45.602
- Yeah. sorry.

887
00:51:45.602 --> 00:51:46.645
No worries.

888
00:51:46.645 --> 00:51:49.147
Oh.

889
00:51:50.357 --> 00:51:51.691
Hello?

890
00:51:51.691 --> 00:51:53.735
Hi. Julie.

891
00:51:53.735 --> 00:51:54.986
Yes. he's here.

892
00:51:55.862 --> 00:51:57.364
Oh. no. he's fine.

893
00:51:57.364 --> 00:51:59.282
I'll have him home
again in 10 minutes.

894
00:52:00.242 --> 00:52:01.243
Okay.

895
00:52:01.243 --> 00:52:02.577
Goodnight.

896
00:52:02.577 --> 00:52:05.956
Well. your aunt Julie
noticed you were gone.

897
00:52:05.956 --> 00:52:09.876
- Did she sound mad?
- Not mad. more scared.

898
00:52:09.876 --> 00:52:11.294
Come on. son.

899
00:52:24.558 --> 00:52:27.018
You got one?
- I got it.

900
00:52:27.018 --> 00:52:28.270
- Oh.

901
00:52:36.695 --> 00:52:38.488
- Are you having a nice day?

902
00:52:38.488 --> 00:52:42.159
- It's going all right.
Me and Uncle Phil...

903
00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:19.696
- "But God commandeth
his love toward us.

904
00:53:19.696 --> 00:53:23.867
in that. while we were yet
sinners. Christ died for us.

905
00:53:25.285 --> 00:53:28.079
Much more then. being now
justified by his blood.

906
00:53:29.247 --> 00:53:31.249
we shall be saved from
wrath through him."

907
00:53:35.837 --> 00:53:36.671
For me?

908
00:53:38.965 --> 00:53:39.799
No.

909
00:53:41.635 --> 00:53:42.469
It couldn't be.

910
00:53:46.056 --> 00:53:46.890
Could it?

911
00:53:55.815 --> 00:53:57.651
- Hey. Cameron!
- Is Uncle Alan in?

912
00:53:57.651 --> 00:53:59.361
- Uh. no. He took the
day off to go fishing.

913
00:53:59.361 --> 00:54:00.403
- All right. I gotta go.

914
00:54:11.790 --> 00:54:13.208
Uncle Alan!

915
00:54:13.208 --> 00:54:14.042
Uncle Alan!

916
00:54:15.293 --> 00:54:16.962
- Is something wrong?

917
00:54:16.962 --> 00:54:17.796
- Kinda.

918
00:54:19.005 --> 00:54:21.007
It's about the verses
you had me read today.

919
00:54:22.342 --> 00:54:25.178
- What part of that passage
was troubling to you?

920
00:54:25.178 --> 00:54:27.639
- Romans. Chapter
5. Verse 8 and 9.

921
00:54:28.807 --> 00:54:30.350
That's how far I got to read.

922
00:54:31.476 --> 00:54:34.104
I've done so many bad
things in my life.

923
00:54:34.104 --> 00:54:37.857
and I just don't see how he
could have done it for me.

924
00:54:37.857 --> 00:54:41.611
- Seeing yourself as a
sinner in need of a savior

925
00:54:41.611 --> 00:54:43.196
is actually just the first step.

926
00:54:44.531 --> 00:54:47.200
- But still. I don't see
how he could've done it.

927
00:54:48.076 --> 00:54:49.911
- Let me put it to you this way.

928
00:54:49.911 --> 00:54:52.622
If you were trapped inside
of a burning building.

929
00:54:53.748 --> 00:54:55.208
do you think that your father

930
00:54:55.208 --> 00:54:57.460
would've rushed in to save you?

931
00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:59.337
- Yes. of course.

932
00:54:59.337 --> 00:55:00.213
- How do you know?

933
00:55:01.715 --> 00:55:02.841
- Because he's my dad.

934
00:55:03.758 --> 00:55:05.051
He loved me.

935
00:55:05.051 --> 00:55:07.178
- That's how the
Lord is. Cameron.

936
00:55:07.178 --> 00:55:10.223
God wants that
none should perish.

937
00:55:10.223 --> 00:55:13.685
but that everyone come to
repentance and faith in him.

938
00:55:15.103 --> 00:55:20.066
God's way of escape was
to sacrifice his own son.

939
00:55:21.568 --> 00:55:22.902
and do you know what?

940
00:55:22.902 --> 00:55:25.405
He would've died for you alone.

941
00:55:25.405 --> 00:55:28.074
if you were the only
sinner in the whole world.

942
00:55:29.743 --> 00:55:32.579
- You mean...

943
00:55:32.579 --> 00:55:33.997
After everything I've done...

944
00:55:35.790 --> 00:55:37.083
How much I've hated him...

945
00:55:39.753 --> 00:55:40.879
He loves me that much?

946
00:55:44.090 --> 00:55:45.508
- More than you can imagine.

947
00:55:53.808 --> 00:55:55.143
- All right!

948
00:55:55.143 --> 00:55:55.977
Good job.

949
00:55:57.645 --> 00:56:00.648
All right. Wanna
hand the tire over?

950
00:56:18.416 --> 00:56:19.751
I love you. son.

951
00:56:20.794 --> 00:56:22.629
- I love you too. Dad.

952
00:56:30.553 --> 00:56:34.140
"For whosoever shall call
upon the name of the Lord

953
00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:35.308
shall be saved."

954
00:56:40.605 --> 00:56:41.439
Even me.

955
00:56:47.195 --> 00:56:49.989
- I've been procrastinating.
It's fine. we'll get there.

956
00:56:51.449 --> 00:56:54.035
Cameron. you only have one
speed and it's running.

957
00:56:54.035 --> 00:56:55.495
- Well. I can't help it
when I have good news.

958
00:56:55.495 --> 00:56:56.955
- Good news?

959
00:56:56.955 --> 00:56:58.832
- I repented and believed
in Jesus yesterday.

960
00:56:58.832 --> 00:57:00.333
Cameron.

961
00:57:00.333 --> 00:57:02.961
That's... That's incredible.

962
00:57:02.961 --> 00:57:04.963
Wow. Praise the Lord.

963
00:57:04.963 --> 00:57:07.549
- I just couldn't wait to
tell Uncle Alan. Is he in?

964
00:57:07.549 --> 00:57:09.342
- Yeah. he's here.
He's in the back.

965
00:57:09.342 --> 00:57:11.094
You go ahead.
- Okay. thanks.

966
00:57:18.935 --> 00:57:19.769
- Come in.

967
00:57:23.648 --> 00:57:25.275
Cameron!

968
00:57:25.275 --> 00:57:27.193
What brings you here so early?

969
00:57:27.193 --> 00:57:28.695
- I had something to tell you.

970
00:57:30.321 --> 00:57:31.489
I got saved last night.

971
00:57:36.244 --> 00:57:37.704
- You did?
- Yeah.

972
00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:40.206
- Oh. thank you. Lord!

973
00:57:41.916 --> 00:57:43.418
- It feels like a burden
has been lifted off me

974
00:57:43.418 --> 00:57:45.628
that I've been trying to
get rid of for so long.

975
00:57:47.505 --> 00:57:51.009
- That's all part of the
beauty of salvation. son.

976
00:57:51.009 --> 00:57:54.053
When God works in
the heart of a man.

977
00:57:54.053 --> 00:57:56.055
the extraordinary happens.

978
00:57:59.726 --> 00:58:01.227
Have you told your mom yet?

979
00:58:01.227 --> 00:58:02.979
- Not yet. I was gonna tell
her this morning. though.

980
00:58:02.979 --> 00:58:05.565
- I know she will be thrilled.
- Me too.

981
00:58:05.565 --> 00:58:07.609
So. I should probably
better get going.

982
00:58:07.609 --> 00:58:09.110
- Oh. Cameron.

983
00:58:09.110 --> 00:58:11.488
How are you feeling now
about Bryson and your dad?

984
00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:14.157
- A lot better.

985
00:58:14.157 --> 00:58:16.701
I have a sense of peace
to it. even though

986
00:58:16.701 --> 00:58:18.411
I still don't understand it.

987
00:58:21.539 --> 00:58:22.749
I should probably get going.

988
00:58:22.749 --> 00:58:24.000
I told Aunt Julie I
wouldn't be too long.

989
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.127
so I'll see you
later. Uncle Alan.

990
00:58:26.127 --> 00:58:27.128
- Take care.

991
00:58:37.096 --> 00:58:38.765
- Where's Aunt Julie?

992
00:58:38.765 --> 00:58:39.974
- She went to the grocery store.

993
00:58:39.974 --> 00:58:42.143
She always goes
early on Thursdays.

994
00:58:42.143 --> 00:58:42.977
- Oh.

995
00:59:04.499 --> 00:59:07.710
- Say. Cam. uh. why don't
you spend the day with us?

996
00:59:08.628 --> 00:59:09.837
- Doing what?

997
00:59:09.837 --> 00:59:11.422
- We have this really
cool fort in the woods.

998
00:59:11.422 --> 00:59:12.507
I think you'd like it.

999
00:59:14.467 --> 00:59:15.301
- I don't know.

1000
00:59:16.469 --> 00:59:18.596
- Come on. don't be a chicken.

1001
00:59:18.596 --> 00:59:19.889
Buck-buck-buck. buck-buck!

1002
00:59:21.057 --> 00:59:22.767
- Cam. summer's
already almost over

1003
00:59:22.767 --> 00:59:24.894
and you've barely
spent any time with us.

1004
00:59:26.479 --> 00:59:27.855
- I suppose I could.

1005
00:59:27.855 --> 00:59:29.649
- That's the spirit.

1006
00:59:29.649 --> 00:59:30.692
- Come on. let's go.

1007
00:59:33.736 --> 00:59:34.654
- Let's go.

1008
00:59:50.753 --> 00:59:52.505
Ah. what's the matter with you?

1009
00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:55.383
- Nothing.

1010
01:00:01.848 --> 01:00:04.350
What are you guys doing?
- Fireworks!

1011
01:00:04.350 --> 01:00:05.184
- What?

1012
01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:10.148
- Hello?

1013
01:00:10.148 --> 01:00:11.608
Hey. Dad.

1014
01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:13.401
Just walking in the woods.

1015
01:00:14.944 --> 01:00:17.196
Sure. I'll be right over.

1016
01:00:17.196 --> 01:00:18.448
Sorry. guys. I gotta run.

1017
01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:20.867
Dad needs a file
he forgot at home.

1018
01:00:20.867 --> 01:00:22.076
Stay with Jayden.
won't you. Cam?

1019
01:00:22.076 --> 01:00:23.786
She's not allowed
out here alone.

1020
01:00:23.786 --> 01:00:24.621
See ya.

1021
01:00:34.005 --> 01:00:36.090
- Wanna see our fireworks?

1022
01:00:37.175 --> 01:00:40.011
- Uh... No. that's. that's okay.

1023
01:00:40.011 --> 01:00:42.388
No. I'm good.

1024
01:00:42.388 --> 01:00:44.474
- What's your problem. Cam?

1025
01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:47.602
- I just... They're
not all that safe.

1026
01:00:47.602 --> 01:00:49.145
- We'll be fine!

1027
01:00:49.145 --> 01:00:50.730
It's not like their gonna
explode just like that.

1028
01:00:52.106 --> 01:00:52.899
- But I mean...

1029
01:00:54.108 --> 01:00:55.693
- We start them
after 4th of July.

1030
01:00:55.693 --> 01:00:58.571
He says fireworks are
only for the holidays.

1031
01:00:58.571 --> 01:01:00.740
- I'm sorry. Jayden. I
just can't right now.

1032
01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:02.200
- Fine. be that way.

1033
01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:03.785
Just wait for me until I'm done.

1034
01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:06.245
Here we go.

1035
01:01:21.219 --> 01:01:22.053
Cameron!

1036
01:01:24.055 --> 01:01:24.889
- Please.

1037
01:01:24.889 --> 01:01:25.723
- I can't!

1038
01:01:26.808 --> 01:01:28.226
- Oh. God. help me.

1039
01:01:28.226 --> 01:01:29.060
Jayden!

1040
01:01:30.019 --> 01:01:31.187
Jayden?

1041
01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:32.855
Are you all right?

1042
01:01:32.855 --> 01:01:34.065
I think so.

1043
01:01:34.065 --> 01:01:35.775
- Can you walk?
- I think so.

1044
01:01:35.775 --> 01:01:36.984
- Is it your arm?

1045
01:01:38.111 --> 01:01:39.153
Jayden. get down!

1046
01:01:40.446 --> 01:01:41.572
- Cameron?

1047
01:01:41.572 --> 01:01:42.782
- Jayden?

1048
01:01:42.782 --> 01:01:43.908
Jayden. go now!
- Let me help you!

1049
01:01:43.908 --> 01:01:45.326
- Jayden. go now!

1050
01:01:48.413 --> 01:01:49.205
- Cameron!

1051
01:01:50.123 --> 01:01:52.208
Cameron? Cameron?

1052
01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:54.502
Oh. please just say one word
so I know you're not dead.

1053
01:01:58.256 --> 01:02:00.299
Hold on. Cam. I'm
gonna go get help.

1054
01:02:16.691 --> 01:02:18.568
Justin. Mom. Dad! Anyone!

1055
01:02:23.865 --> 01:02:25.324
Mr. Dorrity! Mr. Dorrity!

1056
01:02:25.324 --> 01:02:27.201
- Jayden. what's the matter?
What happened to you?

1057
01:02:27.201 --> 01:02:28.995
- It's all my fault.
- What is? What happened?

1058
01:02:28.995 --> 01:02:30.496
- It's Cameron. he's hurt bad!

1059
01:02:31.622 --> 01:02:32.957
- Cameron?

1060
01:02:32.957 --> 01:02:34.000
Show me where.

1061
01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:45.595
Cameron!

1062
01:02:50.349 --> 01:02:52.018
Cameron. can you hear me?

1063
01:02:55.229 --> 01:02:56.773
No.

1064
01:02:56.773 --> 01:02:58.900
Jayden. I'm gonna call 911.

1065
01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:02.028
Go stand by the edge of the
woods and wave them here. okay?

1066
01:03:03.362 --> 01:03:05.656
If you don't go.
they'll never find us.

1067
01:03:12.997 --> 01:03:14.582
Oh. please. Father.

1068
01:03:17.001 --> 01:03:18.377
Save Stephen's boy.

1069
01:03:22.215 --> 01:03:24.091
911.
What's your emergency?

1070
01:03:24.091 --> 01:03:25.384
- Adam. this is Alan.

1071
01:03:25.384 --> 01:03:28.179
We have a structure fire
and a nonresponsive boy

1072
01:03:28.179 --> 01:03:30.223
in the backwoods of
the Gallagher place.

1073
01:03:30.223 --> 01:03:32.975
We need an ambulance
and a firetruck ASAP.

1074
01:03:32.975 --> 01:03:34.852
- I'll send them now.
- Good.

1075
01:03:34.852 --> 01:03:37.688
Jayden will be by the edge
of the woods to wave them in.

1076
01:03:37.688 --> 01:03:39.690
Perfect.
I'll be praying. Alan.

1077
01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:41.567
- Thank you. Adam.

1078
01:03:42.902 --> 01:03:45.822
Oh. please.

1079
01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:49.700
Not him. too.

1080
01:04:15.935 --> 01:04:16.769
- Jayden?

1081
01:04:18.729 --> 01:04:19.564
Is that you?

1082
01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:21.941
- It's me.

1083
01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:26.988
- Where am I?

1084
01:04:26.988 --> 01:04:27.822
- The hospital.

1085
01:04:29.115 --> 01:04:31.075
Mom and Dad are on their way.

1086
01:04:31.075 --> 01:04:33.286
Mr. Dorrity stepped
out a while ago.

1087
01:04:33.286 --> 01:04:34.662
He had to make a phone call.

1088
01:04:44.171 --> 01:04:45.923
It's all my fault.

1089
01:04:45.923 --> 01:04:49.969
I should've listened to you.
- Don't worry. Jayden.

1090
01:04:49.969 --> 01:04:52.138
- Why did you do it?

1091
01:04:52.138 --> 01:04:55.474
- Do you know why I was so
worried about the fireworks?

1092
01:04:58.477 --> 01:04:59.562
Last month.

1093
01:05:01.022 --> 01:05:02.565
my best friend. Bryson.

1094
01:05:03.774 --> 01:05:05.151
died because of his...

1095
01:05:06.694 --> 01:05:10.489
Our fireworks that
we were working on
accidentally went off.

1096
01:05:13.034 --> 01:05:14.327
I could've saved him.

1097
01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:18.789
but I was too scared.

1098
01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:24.337
And he died because
I was a coward.

1099
01:05:26.005 --> 01:05:27.506
- Weren't you scared this time?

1100
01:05:30.009 --> 01:05:30.885
- Terrified.

1101
01:05:32.178 --> 01:05:33.846
But...

1102
01:05:33.846 --> 01:05:34.722
Last night.

1103
01:05:35.848 --> 01:05:36.891
I got saved.

1104
01:05:38.017 --> 01:05:39.852
and as I stood there. scared.

1105
01:05:40.728 --> 01:05:42.355
I remembered a Bible verse

1106
01:05:42.355 --> 01:05:44.273
that Uncle Alan
had shared with me.

1107
01:05:46.067 --> 01:05:48.819
"Greater love hath
no man than this.

1108
01:05:50.279 --> 01:05:54.033
that a man lay down his
life for his friends."

1109
01:05:54.033 --> 01:05:56.577
And I knew that if
I had died today.

1110
01:05:58.162 --> 01:06:00.247
I would be up in
heaven with Jesus.

1111
01:06:01.874 --> 01:06:03.334
and he paid for my sins

1112
01:06:04.502 --> 01:06:06.212
so that I could live
forever with him.

1113
01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:09.256
Jayden. are you
ready to meet him?

1114
01:06:12.134 --> 01:06:13.302
- No. I'm not.

1115
01:06:15.262 --> 01:06:18.516
It scares me to think
how close I was to death.

1116
01:06:18.516 --> 01:06:20.226
If it wasn't for
you. I'd be dead.

1117
01:06:21.394 --> 01:06:23.604
- Jayden. what I did

1118
01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:27.316
was only a picture
to what Jesus did.

1119
01:06:29.735 --> 01:06:31.988
Every time you've told a lie.

1120
01:06:33.614 --> 01:06:36.492
every time you've
disobeyed your parents.

1121
01:06:36.492 --> 01:06:37.827
condemns you before God.

1122
01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:41.789
and that's where the
amazing part happens.

1123
01:06:41.789 --> 01:06:45.251
He rushed in to a burning
building. so to speak.

1124
01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:47.169
to save us from our sins.

1125
01:06:49.755 --> 01:06:51.716
- I want what you have.

1126
01:06:52.758 --> 01:06:54.552
Do you think you could help me?

1127
01:06:54.552 --> 01:06:56.554
- There's nothing
else I'd rather do.

1128
01:07:05.438 --> 01:07:07.773
- Oh. when we get up there.

1129
01:07:07.773 --> 01:07:09.150
let me make sure
the coast is clear.

1130
01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:10.818
Wait in the lobby. okay?
- Okay.

1131
01:07:26.667 --> 01:07:27.793
- Justin. Jayden.

1132
01:07:46.437 --> 01:07:47.271
- Cameron.

1133
01:07:48.981 --> 01:07:49.815
Cameron.

1134
01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:57.948
- Uncle Alan?
- How are you feeling. son?

1135
01:08:00.659 --> 01:08:03.079
- My leg kinda hurts.

1136
01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:07.166
And my head. but other
than that. I'm just tired.

1137
01:08:07.166 --> 01:08:08.167
- Praise the Lord.

1138
01:08:10.002 --> 01:08:13.047
I have some visitors for you.
if you're up to seeing them.

1139
01:08:13.047 --> 01:08:14.256
- Who?

1140
01:08:14.256 --> 01:08:15.091
- You'll see.

1141
01:08:19.553 --> 01:08:23.265
- Mom?

1142
01:08:24.683 --> 01:08:27.853
What're you guys doing here?
- Uncle Alan picked us up.

1143
01:08:27.853 --> 01:08:29.897
- How do you know Uncle Alan?

1144
01:08:29.897 --> 01:08:32.691
- That's a story for another
time. How are you feeling?

1145
01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:37.238
- They've mostly drugged
me for the pain. so.

1146
01:08:37.238 --> 01:08:38.656
I'm mostly just tired.

1147
01:08:40.407 --> 01:08:42.785
I was gonna call
you this morning.

1148
01:08:42.785 --> 01:08:45.955
It's just with the accident
and everything. I got held up.

1149
01:08:48.207 --> 01:08:49.500
I became a Christian.

1150
01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:50.709
- Hurray!

1151
01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:52.169
- Cam!

1152
01:08:52.169 --> 01:08:55.172
- I just wanna thank you.
Mom. for not giving up on me.

1153
01:08:56.465 --> 01:08:58.175
I'm really sorry. Mom.

1154
01:08:58.175 --> 01:09:00.177
for the way that I've
been treating you.

1155
01:09:01.178 --> 01:09:03.722
And I hope you can forgive me.

1156
01:09:03.722 --> 01:09:05.432
- You're forgiven. son.

1157
01:09:05.432 --> 01:09:07.518
- Mr. Dorrity told
us what happened.

1158
01:09:07.518 --> 01:09:09.436
You're a real hero. Cam.

1159
01:09:10.813 --> 01:09:11.647
- Yeah. you are.

1160
01:09:12.523 --> 01:09:13.566
Just like Dad.

1161
01:09:21.073 --> 01:09:22.408
- West Prairie Investors.

1162
01:09:22.408 --> 01:09:24.910
The most honest investors
in West Prairie.

1163
01:09:24.910 --> 01:09:26.787
- What you doin'?
- Oh. you know.

1164
01:09:26.787 --> 01:09:27.872
Showing you how it's done.

1165
01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:29.039
- Really?
- Yeah.

1166
01:09:29.039 --> 01:09:30.249
- Is that why
you're in my chair?

1167
01:09:30.249 --> 01:09:31.959
- It's a comfy chair.
How's that cabinet?

1168
01:09:31.959 --> 01:09:34.670
- Not comfy. thank you.
- Yeah. you're welcome.

1169
01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:37.047
- Hey. guys.
- Cameron!

1170
01:09:37.047 --> 01:09:38.674
It's so good to see you.
- It's good to see you.

1171
01:09:38.674 --> 01:09:40.426
How are you?
- Not bad.

1172
01:09:40.426 --> 01:09:41.260
- Good.
- Good.

1173
01:09:42.887 --> 01:09:45.097
- My crutches are
a little. you know-

1174
01:09:45.097 --> 01:09:47.474
- Too big?
- Yeah. yeah.

1175
01:09:47.474 --> 01:09:49.226
- How are you doing?
- Uh. good.

1176
01:09:49.226 --> 01:09:51.395
I'm glad to be out
of the hospital.

1177
01:09:51.395 --> 01:09:55.774
But I still have a headache
and sore leg. but yeah.

1178
01:09:55.774 --> 01:09:56.609
- That's good.

1179
01:09:58.110 --> 01:10:00.738
- Um. is Uncle Alan in?

1180
01:10:00.738 --> 01:10:02.698
- Yeah. he's here.
He's in the back.

1181
01:10:02.698 --> 01:10:04.283
- You know. Elise. do
you wanna page him?

1182
01:10:04.283 --> 01:10:06.952
We might be able to
save Cameron a walk.

1183
01:10:06.952 --> 01:10:08.078
- Yeah. sure.

1184
01:10:08.078 --> 01:10:09.622
- Thanks.

1185
01:10:09.622 --> 01:10:11.999
- Uncle Alan? Cameron's
here to see you.

1186
01:10:13.626 --> 01:10:14.460
Sure thing.

1187
01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:17.796
All right. he's on his way.

1188
01:10:17.796 --> 01:10:18.672
- Thanks. Elise.

1189
01:10:20.841 --> 01:10:22.843
So. the wedding's
only a few weeks away.

1190
01:10:23.802 --> 01:10:25.054
Are you excited?

1191
01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:27.139
- We'd get married
tomorrow. but...

1192
01:10:28.307 --> 01:10:29.767
- What?

1193
01:10:29.767 --> 01:10:32.311
A meeting of my favorite
people and I wasn't invited?

1194
01:10:32.311 --> 01:10:34.563
- You were invited. Uncle
Alan. You're just late.

1195
01:10:36.065 --> 01:10:37.650
- So. what can I do
for you. Cameron?

1196
01:10:37.650 --> 01:10:40.611
- I was actually wondering if
you were ready to go fishing.

1197
01:10:41.946 --> 01:10:43.781
- Absolutely.

1198
01:10:51.622 --> 01:10:53.040
- Oh. Uh-oh.

1199
01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:53.832
Are you okay?

1200
01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:57.002
Here. I got ya.

1201
01:11:02.383 --> 01:11:05.219
- Ow.
- Here. let me put this down.

1202
01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:15.396
There we go.
- All right.

1203
01:11:15.396 --> 01:11:18.565
- There we go. there we go.
- Yep. yep.

1204
01:11:25.155 --> 01:11:25.990
All right.

1205
01:11:28.993 --> 01:11:29.827
There we go.

1206
01:11:31.829 --> 01:11:32.663
Made it.

1207
01:11:33.872 --> 01:11:35.708
- You really need to
get those adjusted.

1208
01:11:46.844 --> 01:11:49.221
Thank you for
all you did. Uncle Alan.

1209
01:11:49.221 --> 01:11:52.057
It really meant a lot. going
to get my mom and siblings.

1210
01:11:53.434 --> 01:11:54.435
- It was my pleasure.

1211
01:11:56.729 --> 01:11:59.398
I knew that your mom
would wanna be there.

1212
01:11:59.398 --> 01:12:02.276
and that she'd be too worried
to wanna think about driving.

1213
01:12:11.869 --> 01:12:14.204
- I wanted to ask you something.

1214
01:12:14.204 --> 01:12:16.248
How do you know my mom?

1215
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:18.834
- That's a long story.

1216
01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:24.923
- I'd like to hear it.
It'd fill a couple gaps.

1217
01:12:24.923 --> 01:12:26.550
- I suppose it's only fair.

1218
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:29.553
Since you told me your story.
I should tell you mine.

1219
01:12:29.553 --> 01:12:31.889
A long time ago. when
I was a little boy.

1220
01:12:32.848 --> 01:12:33.891
I had a best friend.

1221
01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:36.143
Stephen Taylor.

1222
01:12:37.728 --> 01:12:39.480
- You mean my dad?

1223
01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:41.398
- The one and the same.

1224
01:12:41.398 --> 01:12:43.275
Almost our entire childhood.

1225
01:12:43.275 --> 01:12:45.110
we lived right
nextdoor to each other.

1226
01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:48.614
Then our senior year. your
mom moved to the neighborhood.

1227
01:12:48.614 --> 01:12:51.033
We both thought she was
the prettiest freshman

1228
01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:52.743
we'd ever seen.

1229
01:12:52.743 --> 01:12:54.203
You're kidding?

1230
01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:55.621
No. I'm not.

1231
01:12:56.830 --> 01:12:59.708
To make a really
long story short.

1232
01:12:59.708 --> 01:13:01.585
she liked your dad
better than me.

1233
01:13:01.585 --> 01:13:04.463
So after school and being
best man at their wedding.

1234
01:13:04.463 --> 01:13:07.216
I moved away from the
city to West Prairie.

1235
01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:11.678
and I met someone who
changed my life forever.

1236
01:13:12.888 --> 01:13:13.722
- Who?

1237
01:13:14.973 --> 01:13:15.808
- Kyle Thompson.

1238
01:13:17.184 --> 01:13:18.394
- Elise and Jonah's dad?

1239
01:13:19.895 --> 01:13:21.480
- Yeah. he was a
new client of mine.

1240
01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:24.233
He shared the Gospel with
me and invited me to church.

1241
01:13:25.359 --> 01:13:26.652
- Did you go?

1242
01:13:26.652 --> 01:13:27.653
- Not at first.

1243
01:13:29.029 --> 01:13:30.781
But after we were
becoming friends.

1244
01:13:30.781 --> 01:13:34.159
I started to see the marked
difference between our lives

1245
01:13:34.159 --> 01:13:35.953
and I wanted what he had.

1246
01:13:37.204 --> 01:13:39.206
I became a Christian
a few months later.

1247
01:13:40.207 --> 01:13:41.208
- Wow.

1248
01:13:41.208 --> 01:13:43.335
- But that's not
the whole story.

1249
01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:47.548
The firm was pretty successful.

1250
01:13:47.548 --> 01:13:50.843
and Kyle talked me into
joining the military with him.

1251
01:13:52.302 --> 01:13:55.264
So I turned the leadership of
the firm over to your uncle

1252
01:13:55.264 --> 01:13:58.642
and after our training. we
shipped off to Afghanistan.

1253
01:14:01.186 --> 01:14:02.479
On one of our missions.

1254
01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:05.357
we were ambushed.

1255
01:14:07.317 --> 01:14:09.361
Kyle saw this guy aiming at me.

1256
01:14:14.241 --> 01:14:15.742
And he jumped in front of me.

1257
01:14:19.329 --> 01:14:22.332
To take the bullet
that was meant for me.

1258
01:14:25.210 --> 01:14:27.629
- So. you were the friend

1259
01:14:27.629 --> 01:14:29.840
that Elise's dad jumped
in front of to save?

1260
01:14:31.049 --> 01:14:32.509
- Yes. I was.

1261
01:14:35.345 --> 01:14:37.764
- I can't believe my mom
never told me about this.

1262
01:14:37.764 --> 01:14:40.476
- Well. she didn't know
all the details and

1263
01:14:41.852 --> 01:14:44.021
when your dad died. it
was really hard on her.

1264
01:14:44.021 --> 01:14:46.815
- Yeah. and having to
deal with the likes of me

1265
01:14:46.815 --> 01:14:48.525
probably wasn't helping. either.

1266
01:14:48.525 --> 01:14:50.819
- She called me before
you came. you know.

1267
01:14:51.862 --> 01:14:52.696
- She did?

1268
01:14:53.906 --> 01:14:55.657
- She didn't give me
any of the details.

1269
01:14:55.657 --> 01:14:58.619
She just said "Cameron's
gonna be in town.

1270
01:15:00.621 --> 01:15:02.372
Would you watch
over Stephen's boy?"

1271
01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:05.709
I told her I would.

1272
01:15:07.127 --> 01:15:08.795
- Well. it looks like we both
got second chances of life.

1273
01:15:08.795 --> 01:15:09.755
didn't we?

1274
01:15:09.755 --> 01:15:10.839
- I suppose we did.

1275
01:15:12.049 --> 01:15:13.133
Let's do some fishin'.

1276
01:15:31.735 --> 01:15:32.945
- Hey. Jonah. what's up?

1277
01:15:32.945 --> 01:15:34.488
- I was just looking
at the calendar

1278
01:15:34.488 --> 01:15:36.365
and wanted to make sure
that you were doing okay.

1279
01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:37.324
- Yeah. yeah. I am.

1280
01:15:39.201 --> 01:15:40.619
Hold on one sec.

1281
01:15:40.619 --> 01:15:42.913
- We've got to go soon.

1282
01:15:42.913 --> 01:15:44.665
- All right. I'll be
there in a few minutes.

1283
01:15:45.707 --> 01:15:47.042
Sorry about that.

1284
01:15:47.042 --> 01:15:48.293
- No worries.

1285
01:15:48.293 --> 01:15:49.419
- We're about to take
a trip to West Prairie.

1286
01:15:49.419 --> 01:15:50.837
- No way!

1287
01:15:50.837 --> 01:15:52.214
Cam. that's awesome.

1288
01:15:52.214 --> 01:15:54.258
- Yeah. I can't wait
to see everyone.

1289
01:15:55.634 --> 01:15:57.302
But I should probably get
going. They're about to leave.

1290
01:15:57.302 --> 01:16:00.097
- Sounds good.
- All right. bye. Jonah.

1291
01:16:00.097 --> 01:16:01.974
- Cam. are you coming. son?

1292
01:16:01.974 --> 01:16:04.726
- Yeah. I'll be
right there. Dad.
