Right.

Fuck it. Look.

76
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:30.624
they don't give two shits
about what we do.

77
00:07:30.798 --> 00:07:31.668
All right?

78
00:07:32.016 --> 00:07:33.322
But I see you.

79
00:07:34.366 --> 00:07:35.498
and you don't fit in.

80
00:07:37.065 --> 00:07:39.502
You do what I say.
You don't talk back.

81
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:42.070
You do shit around here
I wouldn't even do.

82
00:07:43.985 --> 00:07:45.029
So let me ask you...

83
00:07:47.031 --> 00:07:49.164
Why do you work
so fucking hard at this job?

84
00:07:51.862 --> 00:07:52.994
I-- I... I don't...

85
00:07:53.777 --> 00:07:55.736
-  I don't know.
- Look.

86
00:07:58.956 --> 00:08:03.308
I got some scoop on a new spot

87
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.355
They're gonna be opening
some manager positions.

88
00:08:07.443 --> 00:08:08.879
I could put in
a good word for you.

89
00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.100
This... this is not some
charity bullshit. okay?

90
00:08:12.535 --> 00:08:14.668
I recommend someone
halfway decent.

91
00:08:14.755 --> 00:08:15.799
it makes me look good.

92
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.019

that loses their shit.

182
00:13:32.899 --> 00:13:34.901
Okay.

183
00:13:34.988 --> 00:13:36.511
See?
That's gross. Come on.

184
00:13:36.598 --> 00:13:38.252
What a guy.
Come on. let's go.

185
00:13:38.556 --> 00:13:39.949
Good job. Bradley.

186
00:14:50.802 --> 00:14:52.761
Let's do it
- in the freezer today.
Chris. no.

187
00:14:52.848 --> 00:14:55.068
There's still a rash
on my ass from last time.

188
00:14:55.155 --> 00:14:56.417
Hey. where were you. buddy?

189
00:15:20.528 --> 00:15:21.659
What the fuck is go...

190
00:15:32.235 --> 00:15:33.193
Stop!

191
00:15:38.894 --> 00:15:40.852
What are you planning
on doing back there. Hardy?

192
00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:43.768
Please don't...
don't... don't do this.

193
00:16:05.834 --> 00:16:09.751
Hey.

194
00:16:10.317 --> 00:16:11.231
Shit.

195
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:13.929
Shut the fuck up!

196
00:17:38.709 --> 00:17:40.407
Help me
move these two to the back.

197
00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.858
Bradley. don't make me do
some "count to ten" bullshit.

198
00:18:16.356 --> 00:18:17.922
Look at this fucking mess.

199
00:18:41.511 --> 00:18:44.775
Take a leg.

200
00:18:54.655 --> 00:18:56.222
Fuck.

201
00:19:16.633 --> 00:19:17.721
Fucking move.

202
00:19:20.985 --> 00:19:22.291
Goddamn.

203
00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.041
Where's your phone?

204
00:19:34.564 --> 00:19:35.478
In my jacket.

205
00:20:11.035 --> 00:20:11.949
Go.

206
00:20:13.603 --> 00:20:14.517
Walk.

207
00:20:28.139 --> 00:20:29.706
Move all that shit
out the front seat.

208
00:20:36.191 --> 00:20:38.498
Bradley. I could've killed you
a hundred times by now.

209
00:20:38.585 --> 00:20:40.587
Will you get in the fucking car?

210
00:20:42.632 --> 00:20:44.852

217
00:21:14.795 --> 00:21:16.013
I've already done the math.

218
00:21:16.927 --> 00:21:19.278
Next shift starts at 2:00.
It's 8:30 now.

219
00:21:19.365 --> 00:21:21.628
That's five and a half hours
before anybody gets inside.

220
00:21:21.715 --> 00:21:23.020
That is assuming. of course.

221
00:21:23.107 --> 00:21:25.414
some potential customer
doesn't fucking freak

222
00:21:25.501 --> 00:21:27.242
'cause they can't get
their curly fry fix.

223
00:21:27.329 --> 00:21:28.896
they break a window
or some shit.

224
00:21:29.897 --> 00:21:31.290
So chances are.

225
00:21:31.551 --> 00:21:34.075
five and a half hours
before anybody steps inside.

226
00:21:34.162 --> 00:21:36.773
Now. if we're lucky.
it's gonna be fucking Donnie.

227
00:21:37.861 --> 00:21:39.646
You know.
he'll take it as a blessing.

228
00:21:39.733 --> 00:21:41.778
sees the store's closed.
he's gonna take his ass home.

229
00:21:41.865 --> 00:21:42.953
But if it's Carla.

230
00:21:44.912 --> 00:21:46.566
then she may know
that something's up.

231
00:21:48.219 --> 00:21:50.657
She may call headquarters.
may call the cops.

232
00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.615
But I'm thinking...

233
00:21:54.965 --> 00:21:57.011
still gonna be like
at least an hour

234
00:21:57.098 --> 00:21:58.926
before they figure out
what's in the freezer.

235
00:21:59.013 --> 00:22:00.493
then another hour
for them to clean the shit

236
00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:01.668
out of their pants and...

237
00:22:02.495 --> 00:22:04.497
figure out what to do
about a triple homicide

238
00:22:04.584 --> 00:22:07.195
in a town of 10.000 people.
So that's at least...

239
00:22:08.675 --> 00:22:10.154
seven hours from now.

240
00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:18.119
Seven hours.

241
00:22:20.251 --> 00:22:23.429
Man. who knows where
we're gonna be in seven hours?

242
00:22:27.955 --> 00:22:28.999
You hungry?

243
00:22:31.088 --> 00:22:32.176

Mm-hmm?

250
00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:18.222
What is that?
Oh.
that's the specialty.

251
00:23:21.312 --> 00:23:24.011
All righty...

What do you mean?

258
00:23:45.075 --> 00:23:46.337
Oh. you mean like...

259

gonna ask me that.

What can I get for you gentlemen
this fine morning?

261
00:23:54.694 --> 00:23:55.999
Well...

262
00:23:57.044 --> 00:23:58.785
Marsha...

263
00:23:58.872 --> 00:24:01.744
Marsha. Marsha. Marsha.
uh. I got a question for you.

264
00:24:02.049 --> 00:24:05.922
Does the short stack
come with hash browns?

265
00:24:06.009 --> 00:24:07.184
No. just toast.

266
00:24:08.098 --> 00:24:09.709
That's a shame.

267
00:24:09.796 --> 00:24:11.885
- But the omelets do?
- Correct. sir.

268
00:24:11.972 --> 00:24:14.148
Okay. Well. then
it's gonna be a. uh.

269
00:24:14.235 --> 00:24:16.150
western omelet
kind of morning for me.

270
00:24:16.237 --> 00:24:19.632
And for Mister...

271
00:24:23.157 --> 00:24:25.028
Bradley. what is your last name?

272
00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:26.595
It's Bradley.

273
00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:29.598
Your name
is "Bradley Bradley"?

274
00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:33.602
No. my last--
My first name is Randy.

275
00:24:33.689 --> 00:24:34.864
Randy?

276
00:24:34.951 --> 00:24:37.824
Well. two first names.
that's really special.

277
00:24:39.347 --> 00:24:41.001
It's very special. Randy.

278
00:24:42.568 --> 00:24:43.873
Uh. What are you eating?

279
00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:45.571
Um...

280
00:24:46.049 --> 00:24:47.486
I'm fine. thanks.

281
00:24:49.139 --> 00:24:51.098
You know what. let's just
get him a cinnamon bun.

282
00:24:51.185 --> 00:24:52.578
He can snack on that.

283
00:24:52.665 --> 00:24:55.494
Western omelet. cinnamon bun.
Coming right up.

284
00:24:56.103 --> 00:24:57.234
Thanks.

285
00:24:57.321 --> 00:24:58.453
Actually. you know what?
Hold up.

286
00:24:58.714 --> 00:25:00.716
I got another question
for you. Marsha.

287
00:25:00.977 --> 00:25:01.935
Shoot.

288
00:25:04.459 --> 00:25:05.678
How long have you worked here?

289
00:25:06.113 --> 00:25:07.549
'Bout six years now.

290
00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:10.944
And in the dining industry
overall?

291
00:25:11.161 --> 00:25:14.904
Guessing 19.
maybe 20 years.

292
00:25:14.991 --> 00:25:16.079
Right.

293
00:25:16.384 --> 00:25:17.820
-  Long time. huh?
It is a long time.

294
00:25:17.907 --> 00:25:19.213
You lived around here
your whole life?

295
00:25:19.387 --> 00:25:20.736
Why. as a matter of fact.
I have.

296
00:25:22.695 --> 00:25:25.611
You got any kids?
- Yes. Two boys.

297
00:25:26.002 --> 00:25:27.482
Eighteen and twenty-two.

298
00:25:28.701 --> 00:25:31.530
When's the last time
- you talked to them?
Well...

299
00:25:31.617 --> 00:25:32.748
You got a husband?

300
00:25:34.097 --> 00:25:37.318
Well. that's just--When was the last time
you've done something. Marsha?

301
00:25:37.666 --> 00:25:39.494
I--Like. really done something.

302
00:25:42.584 --> 00:25:43.629
Something that mattered.

303
00:25:53.508 --> 00:25:54.727
Nothing springs to mind?

304
00:25:58.339 --> 00:26:00.994
I'm going to go
place your order.

305
00:26:01.472 --> 00:26:02.430
Okay.

306
00:26:03.431 --> 00:26:04.475
Good chat. Marsh.

307
00:26:09.959 --> 00:26:11.308
Don't look at me like that.

308
00:26:11.613 --> 00:26:13.746
You think that
affected her life in any way?

309
00:26:22.102 --> 00:26:23.059
What about me?

310
00:26:26.062 --> 00:26:27.368
What about you what?

311
00:26:30.589 --> 00:26:32.373
What does
this have to do with me?

312
00:26:34.636 --> 00:26:36.551
You mean why are you here
right now?

313
00:26:39.293 --> 00:26:42.252
Because. Randy.
I have been watching you.

314
00:26:42.601 --> 00:26:45.778
and I know for a fact that
you are better than this shit.

315
00:26:47.693 --> 00:26:49.172
You have a full-sized.

316
00:26:49.259 --> 00:26:52.480
honest-to-God.
functioning human brain.

317
00:26:53.655 --> 00:26:56.789
And yet. today. I watched you
eat a day-old cheeseburger

318
00:26:56.876 --> 00:26:59.661
because a walking dick with arms
fucking told you to.

319
00:27:02.403 --> 00:27:03.883
You are twenty years old.

320
00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:05.711
and you are already
more pathetic

321
00:27:05.798 --> 00:27:08.104
than every person
in this godforsaken town.

322
00:27:08.191 --> 00:27:10.585
and that bugs
the living shit out of me.

323
00:27:16.591 --> 00:27:18.941
But there's something
about you. Hmm?

324
00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:23.076
There's something fixable.

325
00:27:25.556 --> 00:27:26.993
And I believe that.

326
00:27:30.344 --> 00:27:32.476
I mean. hell.
when you were standing there...

327
00:27:34.914 --> 00:27:36.045
watching me.

328
00:27:37.656 --> 00:27:39.092
waiting for me to kill you.

329
00:27:45.315 --> 00:27:47.187
That was the only thing
I believed.

330
00:27:53.628 --> 00:27:55.064
Does that answer your question?

331
00:28:00.635 --> 00:28:01.854
Thanks. Marsha.

332
00:28:14.823 --> 00:28:16.172
So. what now. then?

333
00:28:18.435 --> 00:28:20.655
I'm gonna eat my omelet
is "What now then?"

334
00:28:32.101 --> 00:28:34.190
What the fuck
are you doing? Let's go.

335
00:29:01.435 --> 00:29:02.958
I'm actually twenty-one.

336
00:29:04.873 --> 00:29:06.048
What?

337
00:29:06.353 --> 00:29:09.095
Before. you said I was twenty.
but I'm actually twenty-one.

338
00:29:15.405 --> 00:29:17.233
So. how long you been
out of high school?

339
00:29:18.931 --> 00:29:20.236
What is it. like three years?

340
00:29:20.323 --> 00:29:21.237
Two.

341
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:23.892
I got held back a year.

342
00:29:25.459 --> 00:29:26.460
When?

343
00:29:30.029 --> 00:29:31.073
Second grade.

344
00:29:35.208 --> 00:29:37.253
- Shut the fuck up.
- What?

345
00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:38.820
What do you mean. "What?"

346
00:29:38.907 --> 00:29:41.431
How the fuck
do you fail second grade?

347
00:29:41.518 --> 00:29:44.434
Uh. I... I didn't fail.
I just got held back.

348
00:29:44.521 --> 00:29:46.001
For what?

349
00:29:46.697 --> 00:29:50.179
What'd you do?
You colored outside the lines?

350
00:29:52.138 --> 00:29:55.315
My mom just didn't think
that I was ready.

351
00:29:55.402 --> 00:29:58.927
Sounds like a crock
of bullshit to me. Randy.

352
00:30:00.886 --> 00:30:03.671
- Yeah. maybe.
- No. fucking definitely.

353
00:30:03.758 --> 00:30:05.934
That's some
over-parenting bullshit.

354
00:30:07.762 --> 00:30:09.764
You need to stand up
for yourself.

355
00:30:11.722 --> 00:30:14.813
Don't let them decide
- what's right for you.
- Well. I was only seven.

356
00:30:16.466 --> 00:30:17.598
Still.

357
00:30:35.964 --> 00:30:37.052
Bring that.

358
00:30:45.278 --> 00:30:46.366
This way.

359
00:30:50.196 --> 00:30:51.110
Let's go.

360
00:31:01.076 --> 00:31:02.121
Hey. Ma.

361
00:31:04.558 --> 00:31:05.602
I'll be right back.

362
00:31:16.483 --> 00:31:18.746
Hey. Give me that.

363
00:31:19.965 --> 00:31:21.401
I got you some breakfast.

364
00:31:22.228 --> 00:31:23.185
Thank you.

365
00:31:30.323 --> 00:31:33.543
Benny. did you get me
some cigarettes?

366
00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:35.937
No. Ma.
I forgot your cigarettes.

367
00:31:36.024 --> 00:31:38.940
Benny.
I asked you before you left.

368
00:31:39.027 --> 00:31:40.855
Yeah. well. you know...

369
00:31:42.117 --> 00:31:45.686
...you can
always get 'em yourself. Ma.

370
00:31:47.862 --> 00:31:52.084
Benny. you know
I can't get my cigarettes--

371
00:31:52.171 --> 00:31:54.042
Here's some fucking cigarettes.
Eat your breakfast.

372
00:31:55.261 --> 00:31:57.437
Don't touch anything.
I'll be right back.

373
00:32:10.363 --> 00:32:11.451
Who are you?

374
00:32:13.757 --> 00:32:16.282
Uh. I'm... I'm... I'm a friend.

375
00:32:17.109 --> 00:32:18.153
F... from work.

376
00:32:26.466 --> 00:32:28.337
What's all over your shirt?

377
00:32:33.212 --> 00:32:34.213
Um...

378
00:32:36.345 --> 00:32:37.390
It's ketchup.

379
00:32:38.478 --> 00:32:43.265
I-- I-- I spilled a big...
big thing of ketchup at work.

380
00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:47.095
Doesn't look like ketchup.

381
00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.315
Well. it's...
it's just dried now.

382
00:32:49.924 --> 00:32:51.012
It's from a while ago.

383
00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.762
Doesn't look like ketchup.

384
00:33:13.774 --> 00:33:14.862
Phone.

385
00:33:16.037 --> 00:33:17.125
Hmm?

386
00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:21.956
Hand me the phone.

387
00:33:23.827 --> 00:33:25.394
I need to make a call.

388
00:33:33.489 --> 00:33:34.490
Okay.

389
00:33:40.105 --> 00:33:41.019
Okay.

390
00:34:00.908 --> 00:34:02.866
Come on now.
Hand me the damn phone.

391
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:16.445
Give me the phone.

392
00:34:17.011 --> 00:34:18.752
What the fuck
are you doing?

393
00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.278
What the fuck did I say to you?

394
00:34:23.365 --> 00:34:25.193
What the fuck did I say to you?

395
00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.108
I said
don't fucking touch anything.

396
00:34:27.195 --> 00:34:28.849
- You think I'm fucking with you?
- I'm just--

397
00:34:28.936 --> 00:34:30.111
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

398
00:34:30.198 --> 00:34:31.634
She... she...
she wanted the phone.

399
00:34:31.721 --> 00:34:33.984
She said she needed
to call somebody.

400
00:34:39.077 --> 00:34:40.948
Who the fuck
do you need to call?

401
00:34:42.428 --> 00:34:44.952
I want to call someone.

402
00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:51.045
Shit. Fucking no phone calls!

403
00:34:54.309 --> 00:34:55.267
Put 'em on.

404
00:35:00.924 --> 00:35:02.361
I just wanted to make

405
00:35:02.796 --> 00:35:05.538
a damn phone call. Benny.

406
00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:12.936
Come on. Walk.

407
00:35:38.962 --> 00:35:43.053
Randy. I think I may have been
sending you some mixed messages.

408
00:35:46.448 --> 00:35:48.668
I think that
when I talked to you

409
00:35:50.887 --> 00:35:52.585
about making your own decisions.

410
00:35:52.672 --> 00:35:55.588
you may have taken that
as a call to action.

411
00:35:58.156 --> 00:35:59.418
And maybe it was.

412
00:36:01.681 --> 00:36:03.204
And maybe that's my fault.

413
00:36:07.948 --> 00:36:09.732
But there's certain decisions...

414
00:36:09.993 --> 00:36:13.388
Certain decisions
that are bad decisions.

415
00:36:14.302 --> 00:36:15.912
Stupid decisions.

416
00:36:15.999 --> 00:36:18.437
And... and they put me
in a difficult position.

417
00:36:22.223 --> 00:36:23.659
They put me in a bind.

418
00:36:26.009 --> 00:36:29.709
Because it forces me
to hurt you...

419
00:36:32.973 --> 00:36:35.541
...when what I really want to do
is help you.

420
00:36:38.892 --> 00:36:40.372
You believe me. don't you?

421
00:36:44.854 --> 00:36:47.422
Because I really
fucking do.

422
00:36:50.382 --> 00:36:52.993
So let's just forget
about everything that happened.

423
00:36:54.168 --> 00:36:56.170
We'll forget
about everything in that house.

424
00:36:56.257 --> 00:37:00.653
and from now on.
the rest of today is about you.

425
00:37:05.962 --> 00:37:07.268
And if I'm gonna help you...

426
00:37:11.316 --> 00:37:12.621
like. really help you...

427
00:37:15.972 --> 00:37:18.105
...then I can't have you
getting in my way.

428
00:37:22.022 --> 00:37:25.068
I need you to work with me.
not against me.

429
00:37:25.678 --> 00:37:26.548
Okay?

430
00:37:30.248 --> 00:37:32.772
So. we square?

431
00:37:37.037 --> 00:37:37.994
Yeah.

432
00:37:39.779 --> 00:37:40.693
We're square.

433
00:37:42.912 --> 00:37:43.957
Super.

434
00:38:08.808 --> 00:38:10.418
Oh. fuck. man.

435
00:38:17.904 --> 00:38:19.253
Let me ask you something.

436
00:38:21.473 --> 00:38:22.691
That stuff Chris was saying

437
00:38:22.822 --> 00:38:24.780
about you not having
a girlfriend. Is that true?

438
00:38:26.652 --> 00:38:29.437
Uh. Yeah. Yeah. it's true.

439
00:38:31.004 --> 00:38:31.961
Are you gay?

440
00:38:33.572 --> 00:38:34.790
No. I'm not gay.

441
00:38:36.966 --> 00:38:38.098
You a virgin?

442
00:38:39.142 --> 00:38:40.143
Uh...

443
00:38:41.797 --> 00:38:44.757
Yeah.
That's good.

444
00:38:45.932 --> 00:38:47.890
- It is?
- Yeah. definitely.

445
00:38:49.588 --> 00:38:51.372
Look. you start having sex.
there's a chance

446
00:38:51.459 --> 00:38:53.374
that whoever you're fucking
is gonna get pregnant.

447
00:38:54.593 --> 00:38:57.247
Then some poor kid's gonna be
stuck with you as a father.

448
00:38:57.335 --> 00:38:59.685
Now. that's nothing personal.

449
00:38:59.772 --> 00:39:01.730
Too many guys
start fucking too early.

450
00:39:01.817 --> 00:39:03.645
they end up with kids
they don't want.

451
00:39:04.037 --> 00:39:05.560
Those kids grow up.
and they find out

452
00:39:05.647 --> 00:39:08.868
they only exist because
they had horny teenage parents.

453
00:39:13.263 --> 00:39:14.352
They start doing crack.

454
00:39:14.917 --> 00:39:16.789
they join a cult.

455
00:39:17.616 --> 00:39:20.880
or worse. they start having
their own unprotected sex.

456
00:39:31.151 --> 00:39:33.545
I'm beginning to think
that most of today's problems

457
00:39:33.632 --> 00:39:35.808
are a direct result
from the fact that teenagers

458
00:39:35.895 --> 00:39:38.027
can't stop themselves
from fucking each other.

459
00:39:39.986 --> 00:39:41.030
So. really.

460
00:39:42.858 --> 00:39:44.425
you're doing the world a favor.

461
00:39:48.037 --> 00:39:50.083
Yeah. I guess so.

462
00:39:53.216 --> 00:39:54.522
You ever had one?

463
00:39:56.568 --> 00:39:57.569
A girlfriend?

464
00:39:58.526 --> 00:40:02.878
Uh. Yeah. yeah. I... I had one.
It was a couple years ago.

465
00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:08.667
What was her name?

466
00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:12.932
Lisa.

467
00:40:13.019 --> 00:40:15.413
Lisa. like the Simpson.

468
00:40:18.111 --> 00:40:19.025
What happened?

469
00:40:21.027 --> 00:40:22.855
Her... her cat died.

470
00:40:25.727 --> 00:40:26.859
What do you mean?

471
00:40:28.774 --> 00:40:31.254
Her cat died. and then we

472
00:40:31.864 --> 00:40:33.953
just sort of stopped dating
after that.

473
00:40:34.127 --> 00:40:35.345
Because her cat died?

474
00:40:35.694 --> 00:40:36.738
Yeah.

475
00:40:37.609 --> 00:40:39.219
Or... kind of.

476
00:40:39.306 --> 00:40:41.569
What-- What are you--
What are you saying to me?

477
00:40:42.527 --> 00:40:44.920
What are you trying to say?
Like. you're saying she said.

478
00:40:45.007 --> 00:40:47.749
"I can't date you
- because my cat died"?
- No.

479
00:40:47.836 --> 00:40:49.751
I didn't--BENSON:
Then what the fuck did she say?

480
00:40:50.317 --> 00:40:53.451
We never really
- talked about it after.
But you were never like.

481
00:40:53.538 --> 00:40:55.453
"Hey. you remember that time
you broke up with me

482
00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:57.106
because of your fucking cat?"

483
00:40:58.804 --> 00:40:59.805
No. not really.

484
00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:04.200
This is.
like. unbelievable!

485
00:41:05.288 --> 00:41:07.073
Randy. no!

486
00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:09.205
Wait. where are we...
where are we going now?

487
00:41:09.292 --> 00:41:12.600
I need cigarettes.

488
00:41:16.822 --> 00:41:18.388
That is unbelievable.

489
00:41:44.502 --> 00:41:45.459
Let's go!

490
00:41:53.946 --> 00:41:57.210
You know. I saw you eyeballing
the gun when that pig drove by.

491
00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:03.172
I need you to remember
what we talked about.

492
00:42:04.826 --> 00:42:05.827
I remember.

493
00:42:06.262 --> 00:42:07.307
Do you?

494
00:42:08.787 --> 00:42:10.005
'Cause I'm not so sure.

495
00:42:17.491 --> 00:42:19.493
Top that off.
I'm gonna go pay inside.

496
00:43:18.421 --> 00:43:19.553
Get in the car.

497
00:43:20.206 --> 00:43:21.207
I got an idea.

498
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:24.819
So. this Lisa...

499
00:43:26.125 --> 00:43:27.779
...you said
she works at the mall?

500
00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:30.608
Yeah.

501
00:43:32.479 --> 00:43:33.698
Think she's working today?

502
00:43:36.135 --> 00:43:37.789
I don't-- Uh. I don't know.

503
00:43:37.876 --> 00:43:40.400
Maybe. yeah. Sometimes.
she works on the weekends.

504
00:43:40.487 --> 00:43:41.706
Then that's where we're going.

505
00:43:44.012 --> 00:43:45.448
- Really?
- Yes.

506
00:43:45.535 --> 00:43:47.363
Yes! Fuck yes!

507
00:43:47.625 --> 00:43:50.671
Okay... We're gonna go meet Lisa.

508
00:43:50.758 --> 00:43:53.761
Look. this...
This makes so much sense.

509
00:43:54.414 --> 00:43:57.199
We got to... You got to go

510
00:43:58.548 --> 00:44:00.550
and talk to this Lisa...

511
00:44:00.638 --> 00:44:03.510
figure out what her deal is.
figure out why she dumped you...

512
00:44:03.597 --> 00:44:04.642
I-- I--...and then. you know.

513
00:44:04.729 --> 00:44:06.469
you can go. you can make up... I--

514
00:44:06.556 --> 00:44:08.036
...you can become best friends.

515
00:44:08.123 --> 00:44:09.908
you can punch her
- in the fucking face.
- Okay. but you--

516
00:44:09.995 --> 00:44:13.476
I don't care. but it is
imperative that you talk to her.

517
00:44:13.563 --> 00:44:16.001
because this is gonna help you
figure out your shit.

518
00:44:16.088 --> 00:44:18.873
Okay. um. but she--
Well. she might not--

519
00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:20.353
W... what if she's not there?

520
00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:23.878
Don't cross bridges
before you get to 'em. Randy.

Hello? Is anyone here?

527
00:44:56.519 --> 00:44:57.695
Just a second.

528
00:44:59.174 --> 00:45:00.654
Hey. how can I...

529
00:45:01.786 --> 00:45:02.830
Randy.

530
00:45:02.917 --> 00:45:04.266
Lisa. hi.

531
00:45:04.789 --> 00:45:06.312
Uh. How are you?

532
00:45:06.529 --> 00:45:08.009
I'm fine.

533
00:45:08.444 --> 00:45:09.619
How are you?

534
00:45:09.837 --> 00:45:11.273
Oh. I'm good.

535
00:45:12.318 --> 00:45:13.275
Yeah.

536
00:45:14.407 --> 00:45:16.626
Since when do you
listen to Motoörhead?

537
00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:21.283
Uh. I don't know. Just recently.

538
00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:22.545
Really?

539
00:45:22.632 --> 00:45:24.591
Yeah.
I-- I-- I like their. um...

540
00:45:26.375 --> 00:45:27.768
I really like their music.

541
00:45:29.509 --> 00:45:30.423
Okay.

542
00:45:32.468 --> 00:45:34.470
So...  ...what's up?

543
00:45:35.863 --> 00:45:38.083
Well. uh. you know.
I was just stopping by.

544
00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:41.347
and I was actually
kinda wondering if we could

545
00:45:41.434 --> 00:45:43.653
- talk for a bit.
- Oh. Now's not really
a good time.

546
00:45:43.741 --> 00:45:46.395
Um. I know it looks dead
in here. but. uh.

547
00:45:46.482 --> 00:45:49.529
I've got a party of
second graders in an hour. so...

548
00:45:52.924 --> 00:45:54.708
Uh.
Well. it... it... it wouldn't...

549
00:45:54.795 --> 00:45:55.709
It wouldn't be that long.

550
00:45:55.883 --> 00:45:57.058
I'm sorry.
but I'm... I'm working.

551
00:45:57.232 --> 00:45:58.930
I'm here to help customers.

552
00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:09.462
Well. we can be customers.

553
00:46:12.247 --> 00:46:14.249
You want to decorate
stuffed animals?

554
00:46:14.815 --> 00:46:16.556
Yeah. Sure.

555
00:46:17.426 --> 00:46:19.472
If you talk to me while I do it.

556
00:46:24.738 --> 00:46:27.045
- Which one?
Uh. T-- What?

557
00:46:27.697 --> 00:46:31.353
Which stuffed animal
- do you want to decorate?
- Oh.  Um...

558
00:46:32.441 --> 00:46:37.098
Uh. Uh. I... How about the.
um... crocodile?

559
00:46:38.839 --> 00:46:39.797
You want one. too?

560
00:46:42.103 --> 00:46:43.713
Let me get a giraffe.

561
00:46:44.845 --> 00:46:46.020
Okay.

562
00:46:46.107 --> 00:46:49.197
Let me go get them
from the back. Excuse me.

563
00:46:50.503 --> 00:46:54.028
<i>♪ All the thousand lies
It comes with no surprise ♪</i>

564
00:46:54.115 --> 00:46:56.248
<i>♪ I'm gonna loud again ♪</i>

565
00:46:56.335 --> 00:46:58.511
<i>♪ I'm gonna go party
With my friends ♪</i>

566
00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:03.429
You're gonna be
a good boy. right. Randy?

567
00:47:11.698 --> 00:47:14.527
Randy. this is fucking weird.

568
00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:18.705
Yeah. I guess it kind of is.

569
00:47:19.924 --> 00:47:22.404
You want to tell me
what's going on?

570
00:47:25.146 --> 00:47:26.104
Yeah.

571
00:47:26.887 --> 00:47:27.888
Um...

572
00:47:30.412 --> 00:47:32.023
I was wondering...

573
00:47:33.981 --> 00:47:36.331
I was wondering
why you broke up with me

574
00:47:37.071 --> 00:47:38.377
after Oreo died.

575
00:47:40.205 --> 00:47:42.381
This is what you wanted
to talk to me about?

576
00:47:43.512 --> 00:47:46.428
Well. we never really
talked about it.

577
00:47:49.692 --> 00:47:52.043
No. I guess we didn't.

578
00:47:55.307 --> 00:47:56.177
So...

579
00:48:02.749 --> 00:48:07.319
It wasn't that I cared
so much about Oreo.

580
00:48:07.406 --> 00:48:09.538
I mean. I did. but...

581
00:48:10.452 --> 00:48:12.977
I... I wanted you
to care about him.

582
00:48:13.064 --> 00:48:15.675
Or I guess I wanted you
to care about the fact

583
00:48:15.762 --> 00:48:17.024
I cared about him.

584
00:48:17.546 --> 00:48:20.419
I wanted you to care
about something. Randy. I...

585
00:48:21.289 --> 00:48:24.031
I had no idea
whether you liked anything.

586
00:48:24.292 --> 00:48:26.164
You were always so closed off.

587
00:48:26.251 --> 00:48:28.818
We... we never talked
about what you wanted to do

588
00:48:28.906 --> 00:48:30.385
or how you felt
about your family

589
00:48:30.472 --> 00:48:31.560
or your friends.

590
00:48:35.042 --> 00:48:36.957
We never even talked about
what happened to you

591
00:48:37.044 --> 00:48:38.132
in second grade.

592
00:48:45.966 --> 00:48:48.142
Look. I...
I know it was unfair of me

593
00:48:48.229 --> 00:48:49.622
to just walk away
like that. but...

594
00:48:50.362 --> 00:48:52.712
...you didn't even try
to chase after me.

595
00:48:55.062 --> 00:48:57.630
Kind of just assumed
it didn't matter to you.

596
00:49:03.462 --> 00:49:04.550
Well.

597
00:49:06.639 --> 00:49:07.553
it did.

598
00:49:09.772 --> 00:49:10.991
Listen. Randy.

599
00:49:11.731 --> 00:49:13.907
I appreciate you coming here. really.

600
00:49:14.212 --> 00:49:15.430
I think it's good that...

601
00:49:15.517 --> 00:49:17.650
that you're trying
to change things up. but...

602
00:49:17.737 --> 00:49:21.306
this just doesn't seem
like the right way to do it.

603
00:49:21.959 --> 00:49:23.351
I don't get this.

604
00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:27.399
And I really don't get him.

605
00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:33.622
Yeah. I guess I'm just kind of
in a weird place right now.

606
00:49:33.709 --> 00:49:35.798
No kidding.

607
00:49:35.885 --> 00:49:39.672
You're spending your Saturday
gluing sequins on a crocodile.

608
00:49:39.759 --> 00:49:41.587
How's it going?

609
00:49:42.109 --> 00:49:44.982
Oh. look at you.
Fucking Picasso.

610
00:49:45.939 --> 00:49:47.462
That's pretty good. Randy.

611
00:49:51.162 --> 00:49:52.337
What are you doing later?

612
00:49:53.164 --> 00:49:54.165
Uh...

613
00:49:54.643 --> 00:49:57.385
I just started my shift. so...

614
00:49:59.431 --> 00:50:01.476
So. like.
if we came back later tonight.

615
00:50:01.563 --> 00:50:02.738
you might still be here?

616
00:50:03.174 --> 00:50:05.306
Uh. we should probably
get going.

617
00:50:06.525 --> 00:50:09.484
Right?
Before all those kids show up?

618
00:50:13.358 --> 00:50:17.275
Right. the kids.
Got the. uh. kids coming.

619
00:50:17.362 --> 00:50:18.493
Right.

620
00:50:20.408 --> 00:50:21.931
You keep up
the good work. huh?

621
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:28.721
Come on. Randy.

622
00:50:30.027 --> 00:50:33.073
Uh. see you later. Randy.

623
00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:35.510
Let's go.

624
00:50:35.597 --> 00:50:36.511
Um...

625
00:50:38.861 --> 00:50:39.949
Yeah. I'll...

626
00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:42.430
see you.

627
00:50:46.826 --> 00:50:48.871
I'm sure she's
a lovely girl. Randy.

628
00:50:48.958 --> 00:50:52.179
but honestly. I don't think
she's worth the fuss.

629
00:50:53.354 --> 00:50:54.268
Why not?

630
00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:56.357
Well. for starters.
she works in a shopping mall.

631
00:50:56.488 --> 00:50:57.793
Well. what's wrong
with shopping malls?

632
00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:59.534
Oh. I don't know.
They're just the embodiment

633
00:50:59.621 --> 00:51:00.927
of corporate greed
and everything else

634
00:51:01.014 --> 00:51:02.407
that's fucked-up in the world.

635
00:51:02.494 --> 00:51:03.625
Well. we work in fast food.

636
00:51:03.712 --> 00:51:05.236
Isn't that. like.
the same thing?

637
00:51:05.323 --> 00:51:07.760
No. it's not.

638
00:51:08.891 --> 00:51:10.632
People go to fast food places

639
00:51:10.719 --> 00:51:11.938
'cause they need something
to eat.

640
00:51:12.025 --> 00:51:14.810
A mall serves
absolutely no purpose.

641
00:51:15.594 --> 00:51:17.639
They just lump together
every form of consumption

642
00:51:17.726 --> 00:51:20.860
into one giant. glittering.
air-conditioned asshole.

643
00:51:24.081 --> 00:51:26.213
Besides. I don't work
in fast food anymore.

644
00:51:30.478 --> 00:51:32.393
- What the fuck is that?
- That's my cell phone.

645
00:51:35.657 --> 00:51:38.399
Says "Mom."Yeah. uh. I should answer that.

646
00:51:38.747 --> 00:51:40.097
I don't think
that's a good idea.

647
00:51:40.184 --> 00:51:42.186
No. I promise it'll be
much worse if I don't.

648
00:51:47.278 --> 00:51:49.845
- Okay.
- Now make it quick.

649
00:51:53.762 --> 00:51:55.634
- What?
- Just. it's for precaution.

650
00:51:55.721 --> 00:51:56.591
Mm.

651
00:51:56.852 --> 00:51:57.984
Hi. Mom.

652
00:51:58.941 --> 00:52:00.639
<i>That was four rings
before picking up. Randy.</i>

653
00:52:00.639 --> 00:52:01.727
<i>Is something wrong?</i> Uh. no. Mom.

654
00:52:02.771 --> 00:52:04.512
<i>Are you avoiding me?</i> Of course not. Mom.

655
00:52:04.599 --> 00:52:06.035
Uh. It just took me a second.

656
00:52:06.819 --> 00:52:08.908
<i>Where are you? It sounds like
you're outside somewhere.</i>

657
00:52:08.995 --> 00:52:11.737
No. I'm... Well. yes.
I'm-- I'm outside of the mall.

658
00:52:11.824 --> 00:52:14.479
- I'm... I'm with a friend.

659
00:52:14.566 --> 00:52:15.958
He-- He just-- He-- He--

660
00:52:16.045 --> 00:52:18.178
He wanted me
to help him pick out some stuff.

661
00:52:19.092 --> 00:52:20.920
<i>Well. you've been
out of work for a while.</i>

662
00:52:21.007 --> 00:52:22.400
<i>When were you planning
on telling me this?</i>

663
00:52:24.576 --> 00:52:26.708
<i>Do I know
this friend? What's his name?</i>

664
00:52:26.795 --> 00:52:28.797
Hi... his... his name is Benson. You...

665
00:52:30.103 --> 00:52:31.626
You don't know him
but he's a nice guy.

666
00:52:31.713 --> 00:52:33.062
<i>Try not to be too long.</i>

667
00:52:34.890 --> 00:52:36.457
Okay. well. listen. Mom.
I... I should probably--

668
00:52:36.544 --> 00:52:38.024
-  End the call.
<i>Don't forget.</i>

669
00:52:38.111 --> 00:52:39.330
<i>we need you to come home
for dinner.</i>

670
00:52:39.417 --> 00:52:40.766
<i>We're hosting
Haley's dance team tonight.</i>

671
00:52:40.853 --> 00:52:41.854
Uh. Right. right.

672
00:52:42.202 --> 00:52:43.290
Okay. yeah. I-- Hang up the phone.

673
00:52:43.595 --> 00:52:45.292
I have to go. RANDY'S MOM:
<i>And I need you to wear</i>

674
00:52:45.379 --> 00:52:46.989
<i>that white button-down shirt
that I left out for you.</i>

675
00:52:47.076 --> 00:52:48.643
Okay. Bye. Mom.

676
00:52:53.605 --> 00:52:55.433
- Is she always like that?
- Yeah. pretty much.

677
00:52:56.085 --> 00:52:58.305
I don't know what the fuck
is wrong with you. Randy.

678
00:52:58.392 --> 00:53:00.002
but you're never gonna
figure it out if your mom's

679
00:53:00.089 --> 00:53:01.830
dragging you around
by your dick all day.

680
00:53:02.962 --> 00:53:04.093
She's a little too involved...

681
00:53:04.224 --> 00:53:05.443
...in how you make decisions.

682
00:53:05.530 --> 00:53:08.837
Yeah. Guess so.

683
00:53:10.056 --> 00:53:12.058
I mean. she held you back
in second grade

684
00:53:12.145 --> 00:53:14.887
for Christ's sake.
Who the fuck does that?

685
00:53:15.148 --> 00:53:16.149
Yeah.

686
00:53:16.236 --> 00:53:18.064
It's just
micromanaging bullshit.

687
00:53:19.196 --> 00:53:20.893
Listen. you're a fucking adult. Randy.

688
00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:23.374
You need to have
a little self-respect.

689
00:53:23.461 --> 00:53:25.114
Well. there's something
I should tell you.

690
00:53:27.029 --> 00:53:28.074
What?

691
00:53:28.335 --> 00:53:29.902
About when I got held back.

692
00:53:29.989 --> 00:53:31.338
It wasn't just 'cause of my mom.

693
00:53:34.602 --> 00:53:35.516
What do you mean?

694
00:53:36.909 --> 00:53:40.913
Um. there was.
um... there was an incident.

695
00:53:43.394 --> 00:53:45.352
- An incident?
- Yeah.

696
00:53:47.049 --> 00:53:47.963
Um...

697
00:53:48.094 --> 00:53:50.270
- What. like a fire?
- No. not exactly.

698
00:53:50.357 --> 00:53:51.793
What the fuck are you
talking about. then?

699
00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:53.099
I had this teacher.

700
00:53:54.579 --> 00:53:55.536
Miss Beard.

701
00:53:57.364 --> 00:53:59.061
And she was. like. this...

702
00:54:01.803 --> 00:54:03.196
Everyone loved her.

703
00:54:03.544 --> 00:54:08.027
I mean. I loved her.

704
00:54:08.114 --> 00:54:10.029
Only. there was this game
we would play.

705
00:54:10.116 --> 00:54:12.945
Um... it was a...

706
00:54:13.032 --> 00:54:15.382
You know when you're. like.
kicking field goals

707
00:54:16.731 --> 00:54:18.603
- but you're using your fingers?
- Yeah.

708
00:54:18.690 --> 00:54:20.561
And... and the football's
an eraser?

709
00:54:20.648 --> 00:54:23.999
Well. we used to do it with a...
with a folded-up piece of paper.

710
00:54:24.086 --> 00:54:25.174
- but yeah.
- Right.

711
00:54:25.262 --> 00:54:26.524
Well. we did it with erasers.

712
00:54:26.785 --> 00:54:27.786
Okay.

713
00:54:28.221 --> 00:54:31.529
And like I said.
w... we'd all play it.

714
00:54:31.616 --> 00:54:32.530
and. um...

715
00:54:33.879 --> 00:54:36.055
it got really disruptive.
I guess. and one day.

716
00:54:36.142 --> 00:54:39.450
Miss Beard had just
had it with us and...

717
00:54:41.016 --> 00:54:43.149
I was the one
she caught doing it. and so...

718
00:54:44.542 --> 00:54:45.934
she yelled.

719
00:54:47.588 --> 00:54:51.853
And something about it
just made me so angry because...

720
00:54:52.114 --> 00:54:54.769
I was being singled out

721
00:54:54.856 --> 00:54:57.163
even though we'd all done it.

722
00:54:57.424 --> 00:54:59.948
It just seemed so unfair.
and I... I... I'd never--

723
00:55:00.035 --> 00:55:01.123
Sure.

724
00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:04.213
I'd never felt
that angry before.

725
00:55:04.779 --> 00:55:05.693
Yeah.

726
00:55:06.303 --> 00:55:07.956
And so I... I took the eraser.

727
00:55:08.043 --> 00:55:11.395
and I put it to the end
of this stupid plastic ruler.

728
00:55:11.482 --> 00:55:13.048
and I pulled it back
like it was a catapult.

729
00:55:13.135 --> 00:55:15.790
and I shot it. and it went
flying through the air.

730
00:55:15.877 --> 00:55:18.489
It was. like. I'd never seen
something fly so fast.

731
00:55:18.619 --> 00:55:20.229
Um.

732
00:55:23.015 --> 00:55:24.146
And it hit her in the eye.

733
00:55:26.801 --> 00:55:27.846
Like. right in the eye.

734
00:55:32.546 --> 00:55:34.287
You knocked out
your teacher's eye?

735
00:55:34.896 --> 00:55:36.028
No. I didn't...

736
00:55:36.811 --> 00:55:37.812
It didn't knock it out.

737
00:55:38.770 --> 00:55:39.814
It just...

738
00:55:40.772 --> 00:55:41.947
There was. um...

739
00:55:42.034 --> 00:55:43.688
Apparently. there were
some bits of lead...

740
00:55:44.515 --> 00:55:47.474
still on the eraser and...
and they got stuck in her eye.

741
00:55:47.561 --> 00:55:49.389
and they had to remove it.

742
00:55:49.476 --> 00:55:51.260
So you knocked out
your teacher's eye?

743
00:55:51.348 --> 00:55:54.002
I wasn't trying to. Oh. my God.

744
00:55:55.264 --> 00:55:56.962
My God!

745
00:56:04.535 --> 00:56:05.840
Well. it gets worse.

746
00:56:09.278 --> 00:56:12.847
How...  How the fuck
does it get worse

747
00:56:12.934 --> 00:56:14.849
than you knocking out
your teacher's eye?

748
00:56:14.936 --> 00:56:16.329
Well. when she came back.
she had...

749
00:56:16.416 --> 00:56:17.939
she had to wear
an eye patch and--

750
00:56:25.599 --> 00:56:27.471
And all the kids started
calling her Blackbeard.

751
00:56:32.258 --> 00:56:33.738
They wouldn't just--BENSON:
That's fucking incredible.

752
00:56:33.825 --> 00:56:34.695
They wouldn't stop.

753
00:56:34.913 --> 00:56:35.783
They wouldn't stop.

754
00:56:36.044 --> 00:56:38.046
And... and then
all the other teachers

755
00:56:38.133 --> 00:56:39.657
started calling her Blackbeard
behind her back.

756
00:56:39.744 --> 00:56:41.398
Like. her life
totally fell apart.

757
00:56:43.312 --> 00:56:45.880
And... and... and then we heard

758
00:56:45.967 --> 00:56:47.578
she wouldn't even. like.
leave the house.

759
00:56:49.231 --> 00:56:51.451
And then after that.
she took a leave of absence.

760
00:56:52.757 --> 00:56:54.149
And so my mom...

761
00:56:55.455 --> 00:56:57.718
she decided it might be best
for me if...

762
00:56:59.024 --> 00:57:00.547
...if I took second grade
all over again.

763
00:57:01.722 --> 00:57:06.335
That's pretty fucked-up.

764
00:57:08.207 --> 00:57:10.949
- Yeah. It is.
- Yeah.

765
00:57:18.522 --> 00:57:19.827
What's she do now?

766
00:57:21.394 --> 00:57:22.917
I think she's back to teaching.

767
00:57:26.181 --> 00:57:27.792
You really fucked up
her life. huh?

768
00:57:33.145 --> 00:57:34.886
Yeah. I guess I did.

769
00:57:38.846 --> 00:57:42.328
God. hey. Hey. Hey.

770
00:57:42.415 --> 00:57:44.591
Come on.

771
00:57:45.897 --> 00:57:46.985
It was an accident.

772
00:57:51.816 --> 00:57:52.904
Forget about it.

773
00:57:54.166 --> 00:57:56.211
It's not the kind of thing
you just forget.

774
00:57:59.476 --> 00:58:01.434
And besides.
it wasn't an accident.

775
00:58:04.437 --> 00:58:06.047
You're seven years old. Randy.

776
00:58:09.747 --> 00:58:11.749
You're not trying
to take your teacher's eye out.

777
00:58:11.836 --> 00:58:13.707
No. listen.
Miss Beard was...

778
00:58:13.794 --> 00:58:15.666
she was... she was special.

779
00:58:15.753 --> 00:58:18.103
-  Randy.
And because of me.

780
00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:19.365
her life was ruined.

781
00:58:20.758 --> 00:58:22.629
You know why I let Chris
walk all over me?

782
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:25.371
Why I ate
that cheeseburger today?

783
00:58:25.458 --> 00:58:28.069
Because nothing good comes
from me making my own decisions.

784
00:58:29.810 --> 00:58:33.248
The one time I let myself react
the way I wanted to.

785
00:58:33.422 --> 00:58:34.685
I ruined a person's life.

786
00:58:36.904 --> 00:58:39.733
So... yeah. maybe you're right.

787
00:58:41.474 --> 00:58:42.823
Maybe I'm a waste of space.

788
00:58:45.478 --> 00:58:48.046
But at least I don't get
in the way of other... people

789
00:58:48.612 --> 00:58:49.700
trying to be happy.

790
00:58:52.964 --> 00:58:54.008
So. there you go.

791
00:59:03.148 --> 00:59:05.629
You said she still works
at your old elementary school?

792
00:59:14.159 --> 00:59:15.856
Benson.
we don't need to do this.

793
00:59:16.117 --> 00:59:17.031
It's not like...

794
00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:25.866
Benson. Benson.

795
00:59:26.345 --> 00:59:28.173
I'm telling you.
we... we can't do this.

796
00:59:28.695 --> 00:59:30.262
I don't see why not.

797
00:59:30.349 --> 00:59:31.785
Well. it's Saturday.
No one's even here.

798
00:59:31.872 --> 00:59:33.178
Relax.

799
00:59:34.396 --> 00:59:35.702
We're just gonna check it out.

800
00:59:40.011 --> 00:59:43.231
Okay. wait.
Benson. please. please--

801
00:59:43.318 --> 00:59:44.929
- No!
- Cool your jets. Randy.

802
00:59:45.016 --> 00:59:47.148
You-- You can't just m... mess
with other people's lives.

803
00:59:47.235 --> 00:59:49.194
I'm not messing with anybody.

804
00:59:51.457 --> 00:59:53.111
I'm doing this
for your own good.

805
00:59:54.634 --> 00:59:55.896
You say nothing good comes
from you ever reacting?

806
00:59:55.983 --> 00:59:57.376
Well. how about
never reacting at all?

807
00:59:58.899 --> 01:00:01.032
- Do you think that's safer?
Mm-hmm.

808
01:00:01.119 --> 01:00:02.294
Because it's not.

809
01:00:03.991 --> 01:00:05.166
Let me show you.

810
01:00:11.346 --> 01:00:13.784
Do you see what happens
when you do nothing?

811
01:00:15.742 --> 01:00:18.615
Now. I've spent all day
listening to you

812
01:00:18.702 --> 01:00:20.573
come up with excuse after excuse

813
01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:22.836
for being the sad little person
that you are.

814
01:00:24.272 --> 01:00:26.274
And now we're gonna
do something about it.

815
01:00:27.536 --> 01:00:29.756
We're gonna find this fucking
cyclops teacher of yours.

816
01:00:29.843 --> 01:00:31.236
and we're gonna see
if she's really worth

817
01:00:31.453 --> 01:00:34.500
you throwing
your entire life away over.

818
01:00:38.199 --> 01:00:40.158
We're already here.

819
01:00:40.854 --> 01:00:42.377
We've come all this way.

820
01:00:42.726 --> 01:00:46.164
and there is no way
that I am leaving...

821
01:00:48.775 --> 01:00:51.778
...until I see a woman
with an eye patch.

822
01:00:51.865 --> 01:00:54.085
Let's go.

823
01:01:06.837 --> 01:01:08.969
- May I help you?
Yes.

824
01:01:09.056 --> 01:01:10.797
Uh. we were wondering...

825
01:01:11.493 --> 01:01:14.192
does Miss Patricia Beard
still work here?

826
01:01:14.279 --> 01:01:15.672
Yes. she does.

827
01:01:15.759 --> 01:01:16.716
Wonderful.

828
01:01:17.935 --> 01:01:20.546
She wouldn't happen
to be here today. would she?

829
01:01:20.633 --> 01:01:23.462
Well. n... no. gentlemen.
It's Saturday.

830
01:01:24.158 --> 01:01:26.291
We really only have
the janitorial staff

831
01:01:26.378 --> 01:01:28.902
and a few administrators
that pop in.

832
01:01:29.555 --> 01:01:31.339
Yeah. of course. Of course.
That makes sense.

833
01:01:32.036 --> 01:01:34.734
Um.

834
01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:36.518
Well. then you wouldn't be able

835
01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:38.607
to give us her address.
would you?

836
01:01:39.521 --> 01:01:43.700
I'm sorry. but who exactly
am I speaking with?

837
01:01:44.701 --> 01:01:46.224
Oh.

838
01:01:46.572 --> 01:01:49.270
We're. um--
We're former students.

839
01:01:50.315 --> 01:01:51.969
We're just looking
to get in touch with her.

840
01:01:52.404 --> 01:01:54.188
Well. it's really not
within my discretion

841
01:01:54.275 --> 01:01:55.668
to provide you

842
01:01:55.799 --> 01:01:57.626
with our faculty's
personal information.

843
01:01:57.714 --> 01:02:00.455
And I totally get that.
I do. I totally get it.

844
01:02:01.282 --> 01:02:03.894
Um. listen. this is--I'm sorry. but I can't.

845
01:02:03.981 --> 01:02:05.330
No. I... I understand.

846
01:02:06.244 --> 01:02:08.768
This is a very
special situation.

847
01:02:09.856 --> 01:02:11.075
You see. this...

848
01:02:13.991 --> 01:02:15.253
...is Randy Bradley.

849
01:02:16.210 --> 01:02:17.081
Hi.

850
01:02:21.476 --> 01:02:22.521
Come on. miss.

851
01:02:22.608 --> 01:02:23.914
You've worked here
long enough. right?

852
01:02:24.001 --> 01:02:25.611
The Randy Bradley.
with the...

853
01:02:28.005 --> 01:02:29.484
Oh.

854
01:02:29.571 --> 01:02:31.617
- Yeah.
- Well. I...

855
01:02:33.053 --> 01:02:34.446
I don't know.

856
01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:36.970
Look. we're moving
to the city tomorrow.

857
01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:40.147
and Randy here.
he was just...

858
01:02:42.410 --> 01:02:43.716
Well. he was hoping
to have a chance

859
01:02:43.803 --> 01:02:45.457
to pay his respects
before we took off.

860
01:02:48.808 --> 01:02:50.375
Please. miss.
it's a small favor.

861
01:02:51.593 --> 01:02:53.160
But it would mean a lot.

862
01:02:54.727 --> 01:02:55.815
Well...

863
01:02:58.122 --> 01:03:00.167
All right.

864
01:03:00.254 --> 01:03:02.300
I suppose
I can make an exception.

865
01:03:02.735 --> 01:03:04.128
Thank you.

866
01:03:04.215 --> 01:03:09.220
Let's see. Let's see.

867
01:03:24.017 --> 01:03:27.455
Carol. I left the schedule
on my desk.

868
01:03:27.542 --> 01:03:29.370
Of course. Mr. Sheppard.
Have a good evening.

869
01:03:29.457 --> 01:03:30.676
I'll see you on Monday.

870
01:03:32.634 --> 01:03:35.202
- Mr. Sheppard.
- Yes?

871
01:03:38.858 --> 01:03:41.818
- Elliot Sheppard?
Yes. that's right.

872
01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:46.170
You used to teach third grade
at Central Elementary.

873
01:03:46.344 --> 01:03:50.870
Yes. Yes. I did.
That's been quite a while ago.

874
01:03:54.743 --> 01:03:58.138
I'm sorry. uh. d... do I...?No. No. no. no. no.

875
01:03:59.357 --> 01:04:02.273
No. I just knew somebody
who... who used to go there.

876
01:04:03.665 --> 01:04:05.624
Well...
...nice to meet you.

877
01:04:06.930 --> 01:04:08.148
I'll see you. Carol.

878
01:04:08.845 --> 01:04:10.629
Have a good night. Mr. Sheppard.

879
01:04:12.283 --> 01:04:15.982
1737 Hazel Drive. Centerwood.

880
01:04:16.591 --> 01:04:18.115
It's just past the diner.

881
01:04:18.202 --> 01:04:21.335
- Just follow Snowbank.
- Okay. Thank you.

882
01:04:21.683 --> 01:04:23.337
A... and. Mr. Bradley.

883
01:04:24.295 --> 01:04:26.340
I really think
you're doing the right thing.

884
01:04:27.689 --> 01:04:29.561
Good for you.

885
01:04:47.796 --> 01:04:48.667
Stay.

886
01:04:53.628 --> 01:04:54.673
Hey. Sheppard.

887
01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:01.549
Wait. No.

888
01:05:06.554 --> 01:05:08.687
Stand up!

889
01:05:22.266 --> 01:05:23.136
Wait. Benson.

890
01:05:25.051 --> 01:05:26.096
Benson. Benson. no.

891
01:05:30.752 --> 01:05:32.711
Benson. you can't. You...

892
01:05:32.798 --> 01:05:34.278
Look. look. look.
We have Miss Beard's address.

893
01:05:34.452 --> 01:05:35.583
We have to go find her.

894
01:05:35.757 --> 01:05:37.281
You... you said--

895
01:05:37.368 --> 01:05:39.761
You said you were doing...
doing this for me.

896
01:05:40.806 --> 01:05:43.026
You... you told me to...
you told me to do something.

897
01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.549
We're doing something.

898
01:05:55.342 --> 01:05:56.343
Let's go!

899
01:05:59.172 --> 01:06:01.044
Randy!

900
01:06:22.369 --> 01:06:25.068
That... that guy--BENSON: You bring him up again.

901
01:06:25.242 --> 01:06:26.330
and I'll kill you.

902
01:06:35.469 --> 01:06:37.906
Things got fucked-up
back there.

903
01:06:38.429 --> 01:06:39.821
You were right to intervene.

904
01:06:42.694 --> 01:06:43.956
You're learning. huh?

905
01:06:48.221 --> 01:06:50.528
Look. I told you
I was doing this for you.

906
01:06:50.615 --> 01:06:51.659
and I meant it.

907
01:06:57.056 --> 01:06:59.754
So let's just forget about it. huh?

908
01:07:02.192 --> 01:07:03.454
Forget about him.

909
01:07:08.937 --> 01:07:10.026
Everything's cool.

910
01:07:19.296 --> 01:07:20.819
Everything's cool. right?

911
01:07:22.473 --> 01:07:23.430
Randy?

912
01:07:25.258 --> 01:07:27.695
Yeah. Definitely.

913
01:07:31.177 --> 01:07:32.178
Good.

914
01:07:46.149 --> 01:07:47.193
This is it?

915
01:07:48.673 --> 01:07:49.630
This is it.

916
01:07:51.284 --> 01:07:52.590
Do we really need...

917
01:08:22.446 --> 01:08:23.490
Quiet. Crisco.

918
01:08:29.627 --> 01:08:30.628
May I help you?

919
01:08:32.412 --> 01:08:35.807
- It's a little late for visitors.
- Hi. W-- Uh. we...

920
01:08:36.068 --> 01:08:38.766
Uh. we... Uh. Hi.

921
01:08:40.725 --> 01:08:41.813
Randy?

922
01:08:42.727 --> 01:08:44.642
Randy Bradley. is that you?

923
01:08:45.817 --> 01:08:46.992
Yeah.  Hi.

924
01:08:50.996 --> 01:08:52.389
Uh. H... How are you?

925
01:08:52.476 --> 01:08:54.173
I'm doing well.
Randy. How are you?

926
01:08:56.219 --> 01:09:00.310
- This is so unexpected.
- Uh. yeah. I guess it is.

927
01:09:00.397 --> 01:09:01.572
Sorry.

928
01:09:01.659 --> 01:09:03.791
No. there's no reason
to apologize.

929
01:09:05.445 --> 01:09:06.359
Hello.

930
01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:08.405
This is Benson.

931
01:09:09.275 --> 01:09:10.146
Hi.

932
01:09:11.451 --> 01:09:12.931
So. what brings you
out this way?

933
01:09:14.585 --> 01:09:15.847
Um...

934
01:09:19.372 --> 01:09:20.243
I. um...

935
01:09:21.809 --> 01:09:24.160
I wanted to. uh...

936
01:09:28.555 --> 01:09:29.948
I needed-- I'm sorry.

937
01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:35.475
Do you want to maybe come inside
for a minute?

938
01:09:40.611 --> 01:09:41.916
- Okay.
Okay.

939
01:09:42.526 --> 01:09:43.483
Yeah.

940
01:09:45.442 --> 01:09:47.618
Be careful. the walls
are still a little wet.

941
01:09:55.321 --> 01:09:56.888
You can have a seat
if you want.

942
01:09:58.194 --> 01:09:59.195
I'm good.

943
01:10:04.722 --> 01:10:06.767
Can I use your restroom?

944
01:10:06.854 --> 01:10:08.334
Sure.
It's right through there.

945
01:10:08.421 --> 01:10:11.032
- just first door on the left.
- All right.

946
01:10:16.429 --> 01:10:17.996
Here you go.

947
01:10:25.786 --> 01:10:26.918
He's interesting.

948
01:10:27.745 --> 01:10:28.789
Yeah.

949
01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:34.839
Is he always so quiet?

950
01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:36.884
Not really.

951
01:10:42.977 --> 01:10:44.240
Are you feeling any better?

952
01:10:46.503 --> 01:10:48.287
Yeah. Thank you.

953
01:10:50.942 --> 01:10:53.161
I just wasn't expecting...

954
01:10:55.076 --> 01:10:56.600
I don't know
what I was expecting.

955
01:10:56.861 --> 01:10:58.297
Well...

956
01:10:59.211 --> 01:11:01.909
I must say it's a bit of a shock
for me. too.

957
01:11:02.736 --> 01:11:05.957
I don't normally get visits
from former students.

958
01:11:06.914 --> 01:11:08.873
We were at the school
before we came here.

959
01:11:09.656 --> 01:11:11.354
They had your address.
I hope that's okay.

960
01:11:11.963 --> 01:11:13.007
Of course.

961
01:11:19.710 --> 01:11:20.711
Miss Beard...

962
01:11:23.714 --> 01:11:25.019
I know it's. um...

963
01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:29.328
too late for me to do
anything about it. but. um.

964
01:11:29.415 --> 01:11:31.112
I just... I... I wanted to...

965
01:11:34.899 --> 01:11:36.944
I needed to tell you...

966
01:11:39.033 --> 01:11:40.339
how sorry I am for. um...

967
01:11:41.688 --> 01:11:42.689
about the...

968
01:11:44.517 --> 01:11:45.692
about what happened.

969
01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:49.261
I know it doesn't make it
any better. but I've...

970
01:11:51.481 --> 01:11:53.439
felt absolutely terrible
about it for a really...

971
01:11:53.918 --> 01:11:57.530
really long time and. um.
if it was...

972
01:11:57.704 --> 01:12:00.707
Sorry. If there was. uh.
some... some way I could. um...

973
01:12:05.277 --> 01:12:06.800
Uh. if I...

974
01:12:09.281 --> 01:12:10.282
Is that...

975
01:12:12.632 --> 01:12:16.375
My daughter.

976
01:12:16.462 --> 01:12:17.681
You have a daughter?

977
01:12:18.072 --> 01:12:20.510
Yes. Tessa.

978
01:12:23.861 --> 01:12:24.731
So...

979
01:12:26.516 --> 01:12:27.386
you're married?

980
01:12:29.170 --> 01:12:30.041
Divorced.

981
01:12:30.694 --> 01:12:33.610
She's at her dad's
for the weekend.

982
01:12:38.223 --> 01:12:41.966
After the sabbatical...

983
01:12:43.924 --> 01:12:44.969
I traveled for a bit.

984
01:12:47.014 --> 01:12:48.451
Got involved with this guy.

985
01:12:50.801 --> 01:12:53.456
Wound up in a marriage that
probably never should've been.

986
01:12:54.195 --> 01:12:56.937
When you get older.

987
01:12:57.024 --> 01:12:59.505
you'll see that
such things tend to happen

988
01:12:59.766 --> 01:13:02.203
pretty easily if you let them.

989
01:13:04.467 --> 01:13:05.903
But I... I can't complain.

990
01:13:07.731 --> 01:13:09.341
If things hadn't happened
the way they did.

991
01:13:09.428 --> 01:13:10.690
I wouldn't have her.

992
01:13:10.777 --> 01:13:14.128
Wow. that's. uh...

993
01:13:19.569 --> 01:13:21.309
I...

994
01:13:21.397 --> 01:13:24.356
I think I expected you
to be less...

995
01:13:25.836 --> 01:13:27.664
Happy?

996
01:13:30.318 --> 01:13:32.625
Well...

997
01:13:33.670 --> 01:13:36.194
...If you showed up here
ten years ago.

998
01:13:37.456 --> 01:13:39.502
you might have found
more of what you were expecting.

999
01:13:41.765 --> 01:13:46.204
After I lost the eye. I spent
a lot of time being miserable.

1000
01:13:47.901 --> 01:13:49.816
It took me a while
to realize that I was actually

1001
01:13:50.817 --> 01:13:52.906
pretty lucky that things
happened the way they did.

1002
01:13:54.386 --> 01:13:55.300
"Lucky"?

1003
01:13:56.170 --> 01:13:59.478
Yeah. Of course.
my life wasn't perfect.

1004
01:14:01.088 --> 01:14:02.133
Mm.

1005
01:14:02.438 --> 01:14:04.570
If all it took was
for one bad thing to happen

1006
01:14:04.657 --> 01:14:08.705
for me to lose my job.
my coworkers. my fiancé.

1007
01:14:08.792 --> 01:14:10.576
then none
of those things were worth

1008
01:14:10.663 --> 01:14:12.143
really having
in the first place.

1009
01:14:13.536 --> 01:14:16.016
And they all would've
disappointed me eventually.

1010
01:14:17.148 --> 01:14:20.020
Yeah. but weren't you
h... happier before?

1011
01:14:21.369 --> 01:14:23.459
Maybe I thought so at the time.

1012
01:14:24.851 --> 01:14:27.332
But I wouldn't want to go back.

1013
01:14:28.594 --> 01:14:30.466
The truth is...

1014
01:14:31.728 --> 01:14:33.120
everyone gets hurt. Randy.

1015
01:14:34.252 --> 01:14:35.819
Not everyone is ready for it.

1016
01:15:00.365 --> 01:15:02.846
You know. I...
I always wondered...

1017
01:15:03.455 --> 01:15:05.718
...if I would get a chance
to see you again.

1018
01:15:08.373 --> 01:15:11.985
You were such
a sweet little kid.

1019
01:15:14.597 --> 01:15:17.121
I was worried that whole...

1020
01:15:18.209 --> 01:15:20.254
...experience might have
shook you up a bit.

1021
01:15:28.088 --> 01:15:30.917
I guess I kind of always
assumed you...

1022
01:15:31.004 --> 01:15:33.180
- ...hated me.
- For what happened?

1023
01:15:35.661 --> 01:15:36.532
Of course not.

1024
01:15:39.622 --> 01:15:41.798
It takes a lot of energy
to hate a seven-year-old.

1025
01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:08.912
Anyway. it was really
brave of you to come see me.

1026
01:16:10.043 --> 01:16:11.349
Most people wouldn't have.

1027
01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:39.986
Let's go.

1028
01:16:41.335 --> 01:16:42.728
Get up. Let's go.

1029
01:16:43.424 --> 01:16:45.513
I'm sorry.
I was just cleaning up.
but if you'd like

1030
01:16:45.644 --> 01:16:46.819
some tea. there's--BENSON: No. no.

1031
01:16:46.993 --> 01:16:48.952
I'm good. I'm good.
We're actually gonna get going.

1032
01:16:49.082 --> 01:16:51.171
Oh. But you have
to at least tell me

1033
01:16:51.258 --> 01:16:52.520
how you know Randy here.

1034
01:16:53.347 --> 01:16:55.045
Uh. we work together.

1035
01:16:55.393 --> 01:16:56.786
Well. we used to work together.

1036
01:16:59.919 --> 01:17:02.356
Randy's real sorry
about your eye.

1037
01:17:02.443 --> 01:17:03.575
He told you that. right?

1038
01:17:04.576 --> 01:17:05.490
Yes. he did.

1039
01:17:06.883 --> 01:17:09.320
Good. Can we go?

1040
01:17:09.407 --> 01:17:11.235
Sorry. uh.
let me just answer that.

1041
01:17:11.322 --> 01:17:12.540
and then I'll see you two out.

1042
01:17:17.328 --> 01:17:18.372
Hello?

1043
01:17:18.982 --> 01:17:19.852
Hi. Carol.

1044
01:17:21.332 --> 01:17:22.202
What?

1045
01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:24.552
Wait. Slow down.

1046
01:17:27.425 --> 01:17:29.383
Oh. my God. that's horrible.

1047
01:17:32.212 --> 01:17:34.650
Uh. is he...

1048
01:17:39.132 --> 01:17:41.047
Oh. God.

1049
01:17:44.398 --> 01:17:48.489
Yeah. of course. I will.
Has anyone called Susan?

1050
01:18:07.465 --> 01:18:08.553
Everything okay?

1051
01:18:10.207 --> 01:18:13.340
Uh.
Someone just assaulted our...

1052
01:18:14.124 --> 01:18:15.560
vice principal
in the parking lot.

1053
01:18:15.821 --> 01:18:16.822
Hmm.

1054
01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:21.174
Is he alive?

1055
01:18:23.176 --> 01:18:26.049
Apparently. he was when
the ambulance got there. but...

1056
01:18:27.833 --> 01:18:29.705
No. he didn't make it
to the hospital.

1057
01:18:37.756 --> 01:18:40.759
Outside of a elementary school.

1058
01:18:42.761 --> 01:18:44.154
Randy. you were just there.

1059
01:18:45.416 --> 01:18:46.852
Did you hear anything
about that?

1060
01:18:50.247 --> 01:18:52.423
Um--BENSON: No.

1061
01:18:57.950 --> 01:18:59.517
No. we didn't hear anything
about it.

1062
01:19:18.623 --> 01:19:19.755
Shit.

1063
01:19:19.929 --> 01:19:22.192
No. no. Benson. No. no.
- Oh. my God.

1064
01:19:22.322 --> 01:19:23.497
- What are you doing?
- Put it away.

1065
01:19:23.628 --> 01:19:24.977
- Shut up.
I don't understand.

1066
01:19:25.151 --> 01:19:26.022
You can't kill her.

1067
01:19:26.370 --> 01:19:27.545
Well. we can't fucking
leave her here. can we?

1068
01:19:27.675 --> 01:19:28.938
Look. Benson. please--Hey!

1069
01:19:30.678 --> 01:19:32.245
I am not getting caught

1070
01:19:32.332 --> 01:19:34.770
on account of that fucking
shit stain of an old man!

1071
01:19:34.857 --> 01:19:36.293
Do you fucking understand me?

1072
01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:38.643
This isn't what you want.
- You don't know me!

1073
01:19:39.818 --> 01:19:41.689
You don't know
what the fuck I want!

1074
01:19:41.951 --> 01:19:44.475
You're the reason we fucking
came here in the first place!

1075
01:19:44.562 --> 01:19:45.911
This is your fucking fault!

1076
01:19:45.998 --> 01:19:47.870
Okay. okay. fine. yes.
it's my fault. but...

1077
01:19:48.261 --> 01:19:49.959
We're here because you wanted
to help me. Benson. Uh.

1078
01:19:50.046 --> 01:19:51.525
How is-- How is killing her
gonna help me?

1079
01:19:51.612 --> 01:19:53.005
My daughter.

1080
01:19:53.092 --> 01:19:54.702
- her name is Tessa.
- Don't say her name.
Shut up.

1081
01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:55.921
- She's eight.
Don't say her name.

1082
01:19:56.008 --> 01:19:57.270
- Shut up!
- She's about to have a birthday.

1083
01:19:58.010 --> 01:19:59.577
Shut the fuck up!
- I was gonna take her to...

1084
01:20:01.753 --> 01:20:04.234
Will you shut
this fucking dog up!

1085
01:20:04.321 --> 01:20:07.411
Quiet. Crisco. Quiet. baby.

1086
01:20:07.498 --> 01:20:09.108
Benson. you... you can't.

1087
01:20:09.195 --> 01:20:11.502
Stop telling me what I can
and can't do. Randy.

1088
01:20:22.121 --> 01:20:25.908
Okay. let's go.

1089
01:20:25.995 --> 01:20:27.257
Empty your pockets.

1090
01:20:27.344 --> 01:20:28.562
Wait. wait.
she's coming with us?

1091
01:20:28.649 --> 01:20:29.650
Empty your fucking--

1092
01:20:30.477 --> 01:20:31.827
She's coming with us.
Empty your pockets.

1093
01:20:31.827 --> 01:20:33.263
Can't we just...

1094
01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:34.394
Shut up!

1095
01:20:56.068 --> 01:20:57.243
Where are you taking us?

1096
01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:04.207
You're the one
who attacked Elliot?

1097
01:21:06.949 --> 01:21:08.298
Why would you do that?

1098
01:21:08.385 --> 01:21:09.690
Will you shut the fuck up?

1099
01:21:09.777 --> 01:21:10.866
But why are you--

1100
01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:12.389
Will you shut the fuck up?

1101
01:21:15.131 --> 01:21:17.350
Just shut up!

1102
01:21:21.528 --> 01:21:24.053
I was gonna fucking shoot you.

1103
01:21:25.619 --> 01:21:27.447
You're lucky Randy here
talked me out of it.

1104
01:21:27.534 --> 01:21:29.580
Just shut the fuck up.

1105
01:21:34.411 --> 01:21:36.804
You see. Randy here.

1106
01:21:37.936 --> 01:21:39.633
he was my little experiment
for the day.

1107
01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:40.634
Right. Randy?

1108
01:21:42.985 --> 01:21:45.204
And he had a few things
that he needed to work out.

1109
01:21:45.291 --> 01:21:47.467
and I was gonna help him
with those things.

1110
01:21:50.906 --> 01:21:54.170
Turns out that
you're one of them.

1111
01:21:57.086 --> 01:21:58.914
Now. if you want to know
why this is happening...

1112
01:22:01.177 --> 01:22:02.265
you can thank him.

1113
01:22:16.714 --> 01:22:18.237
Benson.

1114
01:22:20.674 --> 01:22:22.285
What. Randy?

1115
01:22:23.112 --> 01:22:24.852
I... I need to use the bathroom.

1116
01:22:26.506 --> 01:22:28.682
I can't help you. bro.

1117
01:22:30.989 --> 01:22:33.557
I... I haven't gone all day.
I kind of really need to go.

1118
01:22:33.644 --> 01:22:35.167
Well. then look
in the back seat!

1119
01:22:36.038 --> 01:22:38.649
Find a soda bottle or some shit.
I don't know.

1120
01:22:42.566 --> 01:22:44.568
It's not a bottle situation. Benson.

1121
01:22:46.091 --> 01:22:48.398
Of course it's not.
Are you fucking serious?

1122
01:23:10.768 --> 01:23:11.812
Benson.

1123
01:23:12.378 --> 01:23:13.379
Can I go?

1124
01:23:17.993 --> 01:23:19.472
I want my coffee first.

1125
01:23:21.997 --> 01:23:23.868
You could just
let us go. you know.

1126
01:23:25.217 --> 01:23:26.784
You could leave right now.

1127
01:23:26.871 --> 01:23:28.699
and no one would have to know
that this happened.

1128
01:23:29.439 --> 01:23:30.483
Stop talking.

1129
01:23:32.181 --> 01:23:34.226
You don't want
to make things worse

1130
01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:35.619
for yourself by taking hostages.

1131
01:23:35.706 --> 01:23:36.794
You have no idea

1132
01:23:36.881 --> 01:23:38.578
what's really happening
right now.

1133
01:23:41.973 --> 01:23:45.324
I'm gonna get my food.
I'm gonna get my coffee.

1134
01:23:45.585 --> 01:23:48.240
and then I'm going to decide
where we're going.

1135
01:23:48.327 --> 01:23:49.720
and then we are
going to go there.

1136
01:23:49.807 --> 01:23:51.809
because I'm deciding.

1137
01:23:53.419 --> 01:23:54.290
Not you.

1138
01:23:56.422 --> 01:23:57.554
No more talking.

1139
01:23:59.382 --> 01:24:00.513
Ready to order?

1140
01:24:01.775 --> 01:24:03.125
Yeah.
I'll take a coffee.

1141
01:24:04.039 --> 01:24:05.040
And y'all?

1142
01:24:06.824 --> 01:24:08.086
Well. what about food?

1143
01:24:12.438 --> 01:24:14.875
Just give us
another minute. will you?

1144
01:24:14.962 --> 01:24:16.051
Sure thing.

1145
01:24:26.278 --> 01:24:27.323
Can I go now?

1146
01:24:29.542 --> 01:24:31.240
Please. You can see
the bathroom right there.

1147
01:24:39.987 --> 01:24:41.163
Two minutes. Go.

1148
01:25:03.141 --> 01:25:04.838
<i>9-1-1. What is your emergency?</i>

1149
01:25:04.925 --> 01:25:05.883
I...

1150
01:25:07.276 --> 01:25:08.755
Uh.
There's... there's a situation

1151
01:25:08.842 --> 01:25:09.930
at the Kutzburg Diner.

1152
01:25:10.844 --> 01:25:12.759
<i>What kind
of situation. sir? What's wrong?</i>

1153
01:25:13.195 --> 01:25:15.414
There's a...
there's a... a man with a gun.

1154
01:25:15.849 --> 01:25:18.461
<i>Is anyone hurt?</i> Uh. No. no. Not yet.

1155
01:25:18.722 --> 01:25:20.071
<i>But there's a man with a gun?</i>

1156
01:25:20.158 --> 01:25:21.377
<i>And he's dangerous?</i>

1157
01:25:21.899 --> 01:25:23.596
Well. he... he might... Uh.

1158
01:25:23.683 --> 01:25:26.295
No. he... he's not necessarily
gonna hurt anyone. so--

1159
01:25:26.382 --> 01:25:27.687
<i>But he has a gun?</i>

1160
01:25:28.210 --> 01:25:29.689
<i>And he's threatening people
with the gun?</i>

1161
01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:33.606
Uh. no. Uh. Well. yes. he has
a gun but he...

1162
01:25:33.693 --> 01:25:35.391
Yeah. I'm...
I'm in the bathroom right now.

1163
01:25:35.478 --> 01:25:36.957
I have to go back out there.

1164
01:25:37.044 --> 01:25:38.437
<i>Please stay
on the line if you can.</i>

1165
01:25:38.568 --> 01:25:40.091
What's the address?

1166
01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:44.226
Uh. I don't... I don't know.
It's the Kutzburg Diner.

1167
01:25:44.313 --> 01:25:45.879
It's off of Route 100.
Just come quick.

1168
01:27:12.096 --> 01:27:13.184
Benson.

1169
01:27:14.881 --> 01:27:16.361
What?

1170
01:27:18.755 --> 01:27:24.456
I need to talk to you.

1171
01:27:26.502 --> 01:27:29.026
We need another minute.

1172
01:27:29.331 --> 01:27:30.462
You don't know me.

1173
01:27:31.724 --> 01:27:33.117
You don't know me at all.

1174
01:27:33.944 --> 01:27:38.905
And for you to insinuate
that I've wasted my life or...

1175
01:27:39.993 --> 01:27:43.606
or that I'm not a good mother
is wrong.

1176
01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:47.044
To say those things
to someone you don't even know.

1177
01:27:47.523 --> 01:27:49.351
- that's wrong.
- Come on. Marsha.

1178
01:27:49.438 --> 01:27:50.613
- It's time to head home.
No!

1179
01:27:52.354 --> 01:27:56.140
I've sacrificed a lot in life.
I have.

1180
01:27:56.923 --> 01:27:59.665
For you to come in here
and say those things is wrong.

1181
01:28:00.013 --> 01:28:00.971
You're wrong.

1182
01:28:01.841 --> 01:28:03.539
Leave these men alone.

1183
01:28:03.843 --> 01:28:06.063
I don't want him served
in this restaurant!

1184
01:28:06.150 --> 01:28:09.240
- Sweetheart.
- I'm not going! He's going!

1185
01:28:09.893 --> 01:28:11.590
- Take back what you said!
- Shut the fuck up!

1186
01:28:13.636 --> 01:28:16.421
Back up! Back the fuck up!

1187
01:28:16.508 --> 01:28:18.467
You. get the fuck
out of here now!

1188
01:28:18.554 --> 01:28:20.207
On the ground.

1189
01:28:20.295 --> 01:28:22.340
On the ground!
Don't fucking look at me!

1190
01:28:22.427 --> 01:28:23.602
Get on the ground.

1191
01:28:23.863 --> 01:28:26.953
I was making a fucking point.

1192
01:28:27.476 --> 01:28:30.522
It had nothing to do with you.
Do you fucking understand me?

1193
01:28:30.609 --> 01:28:32.437
I don't give a fuck
about your life!

1194
01:28:32.524 --> 01:28:34.221
Benson.
- What?

1195
01:28:35.005 --> 01:28:38.922
You have to stop.

1196
01:28:39.357 --> 01:28:43.840
What the f... What?
There's no...

1197
01:28:43.927 --> 01:28:45.407
there's no point
to what you're doing.

1198
01:28:49.193 --> 01:28:50.325
You told me...

1199
01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:52.849
Benson. you told me this woman

1200
01:28:52.936 --> 01:28:55.025
would never do anything
about what you said.

1201
01:28:55.112 --> 01:28:56.983
and she just did.
and you shot her for it.

1202
01:28:57.114 --> 01:28:58.507
Are you fucking
kidding me right now?

1203
01:28:58.594 --> 01:29:00.117
You're doing this shit
right now?

1204
01:29:00.204 --> 01:29:01.858
You've got
this whole fucked-up worldview.

1205
01:29:01.945 --> 01:29:03.686
like you've got it all
figured out. Benson. BENSON: Fuck!

1206
01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:06.776
But I've been sitting
next to you all day.

1207
01:29:07.254 --> 01:29:08.168
watching you drive

1208
01:29:08.647 --> 01:29:10.214
around the same roads
you've been driving around

1209
01:29:10.301 --> 01:29:11.650
your whole life--Who the fuck are you?

1210
01:29:11.781 --> 01:29:14.523
Who the fuck are you to talk
to me like this right now?

1211
01:29:14.610 --> 01:29:16.568
After everything
I've fucking done for you!

1212
01:29:16.655 --> 01:29:19.397
- Listen. Benson.
I am fucking listening
to you. Randy!

1213
01:29:19.484 --> 01:29:22.531
No.

1214
01:29:25.272 --> 01:29:29.625
Listen.

1215
01:29:29.712 --> 01:29:30.800
Listen.

1216
01:29:36.458 --> 01:29:38.808
Oh. shit.

1217
01:29:42.028 --> 01:29:46.598
Fuck. Okay.
What the f...

1218
01:29:47.207 --> 01:29:49.775
Who called 'em? Who called 'em?

1219
01:29:52.343 --> 01:29:56.086
Who called 'em?

1220
01:29:56.347 --> 01:29:59.524
It was you.
It was you. wasn't it?

1221
01:29:59.611 --> 01:30:02.309
It was you. wasn't it.
you fucking bitch?

1222
01:30:02.571 --> 01:30:04.616
- You fucking bitch!
No. Benson. wai--

1223
01:30:08.664 --> 01:30:10.535
Shit. shit. shit. shit.

1224
01:30:10.622 --> 01:30:13.843
Fuck. Fuck. Stupid.
- Get a fucking-- Get something!
Okay.

1225
01:30:14.017 --> 01:30:16.846
Shit!  Goddamn it!

1226
01:30:16.933 --> 01:30:19.326
Why the fuck did you
do that. you fucking idiot?

1227
01:30:19.414 --> 01:30:21.807
Here. Here.

1228
01:30:22.155 --> 01:30:23.330
Fuck.

1229
01:30:23.418 --> 01:30:25.681
Fuck. Randy. I'm sorry.

1230
01:30:26.029 --> 01:30:28.031
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Fuck.

1231
01:30:28.597 --> 01:30:30.294
Oh. fuck. fuck.

1232
01:30:32.470 --> 01:30:34.559
I did it. I did it.

1233
01:30:34.951 --> 01:30:39.608
I did it.
I called the... cops.

1234
01:30:39.695 --> 01:30:42.132
I called...
I called the cops.

1235
01:30:44.961 --> 01:30:46.528
I c... I called the cops.

1236
01:31:06.983 --> 01:31:08.375
It was me.

1237
01:31:11.727 --> 01:31:14.207
It was me.

1238
01:31:27.003 --> 01:31:28.483
You're still in charge. Benson.

1239
01:32:02.212 --> 01:32:03.866
You know. when I was a kid...

1240
01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:13.963
...I went to the zoo
on a class trip.

1241
01:32:26.149 --> 01:32:27.846
And when I came home...

1242
01:32:32.329 --> 01:32:35.114
I decided I wanted
to be a giraffe when I grew up.

1243
01:32:42.774 --> 01:32:43.601
Hmm.

1244
01:33:01.532 --> 01:33:03.316
I was never in charge. Randy.

1245
01:33:33.129 --> 01:33:34.130
Benson.

1246
01:33:34.913 --> 01:33:37.133
Hands up!
Get on the ground!

1247
01:33:37.612 --> 01:33:39.918
- Get on the fucking ground now!
Get your hands up now!

1248
01:33:40.005 --> 01:33:41.441
Gun! Gun! Gun!
Gun! Gun!

1249
01:33:51.887 --> 01:33:56.021
Do not move!
- Stay right there.
- Do not move your fucking hands!

1250
01:33:57.893 --> 01:34:01.070
Okay. don't move.

1251
01:34:42.067 --> 01:34:44.026
<i>Now you're just
playing with the eraser.</i>

1252
01:34:45.027 --> 01:34:46.158
Flick it right through.

1253
01:34:47.856 --> 01:34:49.509
- Like this?
Yeah.

1254
01:34:51.076 --> 01:34:54.384
Nice. That was... that was
pretty impressive. I must say.

1255
01:34:55.690 --> 01:34:58.170
Give it a really good flick.

1256
01:34:58.257 --> 01:34:59.737
- That was a really good flick.
I'm home.

1257
01:34:59.868 --> 01:35:01.391
Mom!

1258
01:35:02.653 --> 01:35:05.395
Hi. baby.

1259
01:35:05.482 --> 01:35:07.005
Can you help me put this away
in the kitchen?

1260
01:35:07.092 --> 01:35:08.485
Yeah.
- Just a second.

1261
01:35:12.619 --> 01:35:13.664
Hi. Mom.

1262
01:35:14.534 --> 01:35:16.972
<i>Hi. Randy. Hey. how's--</i>

1263
01:35:17.059 --> 01:35:19.496
It's fine. Mom. I'm just. uh...

1264
01:35:19.583 --> 01:35:20.671

1265
01:35:22.629 --> 01:35:23.674
<i>Will you be home for dinner?</i>

1266
01:35:24.501 --> 01:35:25.589
Uh.

1267
01:35:26.024 --> 01:35:28.287
I told you. Mom.
I'm meeting friends.

1268
01:35:28.374 --> 01:35:31.813
<i>Okay. then.
Uh. sounds... sounds good.</i>

1269
01:35:33.379 --> 01:35:35.730
<i>All right. then.</i> I'll see you tonight. Mom.

1270
01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:40.604
<i>I love you.</i> I love you. Bye.

1271
01:35:42.911 --> 01:35:44.129
Here you go.

1272
01:35:44.216 --> 01:35:46.262
Are you sure you're good
for next Tuesday?

1273
01:35:46.349 --> 01:35:48.003
Yep. I'll be here.
- Okay.

1274
01:35:48.090 --> 01:35:49.613

Bye.

1275
01:35:51.615 --> 01:35:53.748

a good job cleaning up.
