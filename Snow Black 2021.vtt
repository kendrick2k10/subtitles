178
00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.295
(gun fires)

179
00:07:35.998 --> 00:07:38.667
(bomb explodes)

180
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:44.507

181
00:07:44.548 --> 00:07:46.800
(gun fires)

182
00:07:57.935 --> 00:08:00.690
What the fuck
happened out there?

183
00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:04.110
We made this our mission.

184
00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:11.367
(mumbles) practising
this mission.

185
00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:16.413
Sloppy you need me to
mention anything to you?

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.877
Better read the fucking

All your hat. your

Fuck you better shape up.

189
00:08:31.595 --> 00:08:34.265
That's what you should know huh?

190
00:08:35.432 --> 00:08:37.183
Did you run the idea?

191
00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:40.978
(indistinct)

192
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.023
Is everything here clear?

193
00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:44.983
- Yes sir.

194
00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:49.280
- (Indistinct) what the

195
00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:52.115
Your were probably

00:08:52.157 --> 00:08:53.950
Where were you
(mumbles) two guys

197
00:08:53.992 --> 00:08:55.785
and you fucking

198
00:08:55.827 --> 00:09:00.082
and you ain't got no
fucking gun cover our back.

199
00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:01.792
Jesus fucking Christ.

200
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:09.175
Two months four days
practicing this mission.

201
00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:15.263
I got the best (Indistinct).

202
00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.227
Hey get the fuck out of here.

203
00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:21.020
- Sir.

204
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.773
(Dramatic music)

205
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:36.617
- See you're asking why
we ditch you.

206
00:09:36.658 --> 00:09:39.830
the Philippines and you
pull this shit.

207
00:09:40.872 --> 00:09:43.167
Get the fuck out of my face.

208
00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:50.132
- You made it.

209
00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:03.060
You're finally here.

210
00:10:03.102 --> 00:10:04.647
And I thought the army
was going to turn you

211
00:10:04.688 --> 00:10:06.898
into a stone cold killer.

212
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.317
- Marines dad it was
the marines.

213
00:10:09.358 --> 00:10:12.028
- Army marines shit
it's all the same to me.

214
00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.157
I'm just glad you're home.

215
00:10:16.242 --> 00:10:18.995
(birds chirping)

216
00:10:33.467 --> 00:10:34.925
- (mumbles) Kenya upstairs?

217
00:10:34.967 --> 00:10:37.972
- Yeah she's been around all
day but I haven't seen her.

218
00:10:38.013 --> 00:10:40.348
(indistinct)

219
00:10:41.933 --> 00:10:43.143
- And if you left I
should have softened up

220
00:10:43.185 --> 00:10:44.770
a little bit on her.

221
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.440
You know you look just
like your mother.

222
00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.567
- Been a while since
I've heard that.

223
00:10:51.608 --> 00:10:53.778
- I guess I can't
believe you're here.

224
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.323
I bet you tried anything
to stay away from us.

225
00:10:56.365 --> 00:10:57.365
- Yeah.

226
00:10:57.407 --> 00:10:59.993
- I just want my family back.

227
00:11:00.035 --> 00:11:01.453
- How did she die?

228
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.668
- A week after you left

229
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.047
we had a run with came back.

230
00:11:12.922 --> 00:11:14.715
- Don't you pay that butcher.

231
00:11:14.757 --> 00:11:18.095
- Don't tell me what to
do with my money.

232
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:21.473
- What's happening here?

233
00:11:21.515 --> 00:11:23.725
- Mom's high again.

234
00:11:23.767 --> 00:11:25.310
- Don't disrespect your mother.

235
00:11:25.352 --> 00:11:26.562
- She's a crack head.

236
00:11:26.603 --> 00:11:27.395
- Get out.

237
00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:28.355
- I hate you

238
00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:36.655

239
00:11:36.697 --> 00:11:39.200

240
00:11:43.787 --> 00:11:45.205
- They weren't

241
00:11:45.247 --> 00:11:49.877
- We got your mom to
rehab (mumbles) open up.

242
00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:52.797
(indistinct)

243
00:11:54.588 --> 00:11:56.465
- They shop for rehab (mumbles)?

244
00:11:56.507 --> 00:11:59.428
- Sort of what happens
all the time.

245
00:12:02.973 --> 00:12:03.807
- Hey siz

246
00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:05.768

00:12:08.812 --> 00:12:12.315
Take her bag upstairs
I'm sure she's tired.

249
00:12:20.032 --> 00:12:21.200
- Here let me.

250
00:12:25.203 --> 00:12:28.123
- Thanks (mumbles)

251
00:12:38.048 --> 00:12:43.055
It has actually been a
while since I've been here.

252
00:12:43.097 --> 00:12:46.017
- (mumbles) the same.

253
00:12:47.392 --> 00:12:51.980
You know you don't have
to keep stuff bottled in.

254
00:12:52.022 --> 00:12:54.148
- Keep what bottled in.

255
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.192
- I know you.

256
00:13:01.488 --> 00:13:04.785
- Ever since you left
I've been feeling.

257
00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:09.582

258
00:13:13.125 --> 00:13:15.170
It's hard keep planting
up some kinda (mumbles).

259
00:13:15.212 --> 00:13:17.715
- I just had to get outta here.

260
00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.595
- I felt like you
left me behind.

261
00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.807
You taught me a lot about life.

262
00:13:28.182 --> 00:13:31.228
But never anything
about abandonment.

263
00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.072
I had to watch mum

264
00:13:44.615 --> 00:13:48.703
(mumbles) like she was a zombie.

265
00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.167
I always hoped I really thought

266
00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:58.880
it could get better after rehab.

267
00:14:00.465 --> 00:14:03.885
- I'm sorry if it makes
you feel any better.

268
00:14:03.927 --> 00:14:07.430
The military was not
sunshine and rainbows.

269
00:14:08.682 --> 00:14:11.852
- I can tell you're
hiding things too.

270
00:14:23.653 --> 00:14:27.910
- So this is the type of
stuff you're watching now?

00:14:38.462 --> 00:14:40.255
Let me show something.

272

and they got this
drug called seed.

296

It's like people are killing
each other. going crazy

297
00:15:46.655 --> 00:15:48.072
in the streets.

298
00:15:48.113 --> 00:15:50.325
You gotta watch out and be
careful while you out here.

00:28:29.207 --> 00:28:31.252

00:28:39.175 --> 00:28:42.888
And your sister. hers
was the same way.

448
00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:44.557
- She was a drug mule?

449
00:28:44.598 --> 00:28:47.558
- No. your sister was beaten

450
00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:51.480
and someone forcibly made
her swallow the drugs.

451
00:28:51.522 --> 00:28:53.982
- The cops wanted to
keep it quiet?

452
00:28:54.023 --> 00:28:55.067
- There are some things
you should know

453
00:28:55.108 --> 00:28:57.693
about this city. Ms. Camden.

454
00:28:57.735 --> 00:28:59.738
There are a lot of people
who wanna keep things

455
00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.198
in the status quo.

456
00:29:02.658 --> 00:29:03.660

to the church here for
over 25 years.

470
00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:36.418
And yet just last week we
laid to rest mother Camden

471
00:30:38.253 --> 00:30:40.423
and now they placed Kenya.

472
00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:48.723
Our hearts are heavy.

Church we feel defeated.

475
00:31:01.108 --> 00:31:05.615
We feel like we can't
accomplish the goal of survival.

476
00:31:09.075 --> 00:31:11.078
How do we overcome that?

477
00:31:13.788 --> 00:31:18.543
What can we do to save the
lives that are remaining here?

478
00:31:24.217 --> 00:31:25.510
Anybody? Anyone?

479
00:31:28.262 --> 00:31:30.432
Wake up we cannot continue

480
00:31:35.018 --> 00:31:37.272
to die and live in despair.

481
00:31:40.565 --> 00:31:45.447
There's a whole community of
people out there that need us.

482
00:31:47.113 --> 00:31:48.865
And this tragedy.

483

another loved one

484
00:31:53.787 --> 00:31:55.790

I can't stay here.

492

- [Sarah] No they ain't talking.

496
00:32:27.947 --> 00:32:29.280
They don't say a lot.

497
00:32:29.322 --> 00:32:31.325
I'm willing to bet that
Bloodbornes were involved.

498
00:32:31.367 --> 00:32:32.785
- [Sidney] You know
that for sure?

499

00:32:36.997 --> 00:32:39.625
- [Sidney] That looks like
a good place to start. stop.

503
00:32:39.667 --> 00:32:40.835
- [Sarah] What?

504
00:32:42.377 --> 00:32:44.003

Somebody somewhere. knows

- Relax I'll make it quick.

508
00:32:50.302 --> 00:32:52.303
- That's a dangerous place.

509
00:32:52.345 --> 00:32:53.472
- What could I do?

510
00:32:53.513 --> 00:32:54.848
I'm just the woman.

00:33:15.243 --> 00:33:18.955
Can you tell me who is the
leader of the Bloodbornes?

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:22.208
- I'm not your momma.

515
00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:25.920

We've just come from the
chief of police.

534
00:35:31.755 --> 00:35:34.925
and he doesn't have any
answers for me.

00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:06.665
I'm talking children.

00:36:06.707 --> 00:36:08.375
Mr. Knoc son is dead.

You have yet to do
anything about it.

547
00:36:20.137 --> 00:36:23.390
And like. here's what I
gathered so far.

549
00:36:27.685 --> 00:36:30.980
about it. I'mma to have
to figure it out.

00:36:31.022 --> 00:36:33.483
and take care of it myself.
because this is not cool.

00:36:33.525 --> 00:36:35.402
I got one son left.

552
00:36:35.443 --> 00:36:36.528
It's not good.

553
00:36:37.778 --> 00:36:39.155

Weed is not illegal

Anyway I think this
belongs to you.

561
00:37:03.888 --> 00:37:04.890
You should have it.

something stupid.

684
00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:07.483

Yeah. that's right.

I did a background check on you.

688
00:42:16.033 --> 00:42:18.995
Seems like you're some
kind of spook for the army?

689
00:42:19.037 --> 00:42:20.413
- Marines.

690
00:42:20.455 --> 00:42:23.207
- Bullshit tell me the truth.

691
00:42:23.248 --> 00:42:26.293
- I did counter
insurgency for the CIA.

692
00:42:26.335 --> 00:42:29.757
My CO even gave me a code
name snow black.

693
00:42:40.308 --> 00:42:42.602
I was a high rank killer.

694
00:42:42.643 --> 00:42:44.687
No better than the dirt
bags I was putting

695
00:42:44.728 --> 00:42:47.650
in (mumbles) boxes.

696
00:42:54.863 --> 00:42:59.785
Before that I was brought up
on a review for depression.

697
00:42:59.827 --> 00:43:01.537
I thought I was losing my mind.

698
00:43:01.578 --> 00:43:03.540
I even put a bullet to my head.

699
00:43:03.582 --> 00:43:05.583
What the fuck was I thinking?

700
00:43:05.625 --> 00:43:08.002
- Then why are you back here?

701
00:43:08.043 --> 00:43:09.128
- My mother died.

702
00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:11.172
I didn't get a chance
to say goodbye.

703
00:43:11.213 --> 00:43:12.925
I came to bury my mum.

704
00:43:14.425 --> 00:43:17.345
Someone so beautiful
yet so deadly.

705
00:43:18.303 --> 00:43:20.723
- I do what needs to be done.

706
00:43:23.308 --> 00:43:26.562
- Don't you don't know what
you're getting yourself into.

707
00:43:26.603 --> 00:43:29.273
- They don't know what they're
getting themselves into.

708
00:43:29.315 --> 00:43:30.525
- So is that what you gonna do?

709
00:43:30.567 --> 00:43:31.735

about my city and the
great things we're doing

743

00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:19.152
- Well. I mean. we've got a
lot of civic projects going on.

747
00:46:19.193 --> 00:46:20.820
A lot of inclusiveness.

748
00:46:20.862 --> 00:46:25.115
We're always looking to
honor all of our people

749
00:46:25.157 --> 00:46:27.243
all the diversity that
we have that we're proud

750
00:46:27.285 --> 00:46:29.663
of in King city. infrastructure.

751
00:46:31.163 --> 00:46:34.500
King city's on the rise. we're
happy to be a part of it.

752
00:46:34.542 --> 00:46:35.793
- So I hear that

753
00:46:37.293 --> 00:46:41.132
you know. about gang
Bloodbornes. the Bloodbornes?

754
00:46:42.467 --> 00:46:46.095
- Right we are aware of
the. the bloodbornes.

755
00:46:46.137 --> 00:46:47.388
we're aware of this new drug

756
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:49.348
the seed that they're pushing.

757
00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:54.145
And we're constantly trying
to take it out of distribution

758
00:46:55.603 --> 00:47:00.400
and hold people accountable
that they're pushing it.

759
00:47:00.442 --> 00:47:04.155
- You're out there in the
city. you must be talking

760
00:47:04.197 --> 00:47:07.617
to them. you know have
some kind of relationship.

761
00:47:07.658 --> 00:47:11.287
- So we have no ties or
affiliations with the

762
00:47:11.328 --> 00:47:12.372
Bloodbornes.

763
00:47:14.123 --> 00:47:15.708
I am aware of them.

764
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:18.378
I have had concerned
citizens come to us.

765
00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:23.633
about even the deaths that
have occurred because of that.

766
00:47:23.675 --> 00:47:25.092
- [Jessica] Yeah.

767
00:47:25.133 --> 00:47:30.140
- I've worked with people
that are concerned. citizens.

768
00:47:30.182 --> 00:47:30.765
some with like

769
00:47:32.182 --> 00:47:36.313
well. I mean. for instance.
Ricardo White. who has

770
00:47:39.398 --> 00:47:43.612
funds available to help
us try and eliminate this.

771
00:47:43.653 --> 00:47:45.445
And he's a concerned person

772
00:47:45.487 --> 00:47:49.200
citizen who is aiding us
in finding the resources

773
00:47:49.242 --> 00:47:50.492
to do something (mumbles)

774
00:47:50.533 --> 00:47:54.122
What is your affiliation
with Ricardo White?

775
00:47:55.998 --> 00:48:00.420
= Well. the truth is that
people will push a narrative.

776
00:48:00.462 --> 00:48:01.672
And the truth is.

777
00:48:01.713 --> 00:48:02.463
- Yeah

778
00:48:02.505 --> 00:48:03.922
- If you let a rumor run.

779
00:48:03.963 --> 00:48:08.720
it will run rampant that
you're not gonna get the truth.

780
00:48:08.762 --> 00:48:09.887
When you're gonna

781
00:48:09.928 --> 00:48:11.805
- I think it's a little
more than that.

782
00:48:11.847 --> 00:48:14.392
- So they're just rumors
and if you're trying to...

783
00:48:14.433 --> 00:48:16.477
- [Host] Come on (mumbles)
calm down you don't have...

784
00:48:16.518 --> 00:48:20.230
- No I think maybe you
need to calm down.

785
00:48:20.272 --> 00:48:22.817
My daughter's been

And I am a victim of
this myself.

789
00:48:29.698 --> 00:48:30.992
- Oh we have a call.

790
00:48:31.033 --> 00:48:32.785

I tell you what I'm
gonna do about it.

801

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:12.200
to the police station and I
will just push them to do more.

803

I get in their face.

804
00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:18.497

851
00:54:21.175 --> 00:54:23.512

852
00:54:29.392 --> 00:54:30.477
That's funny.
