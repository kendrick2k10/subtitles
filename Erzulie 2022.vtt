00:10:42.377 --> 00:10:44.113
<i>because you made</i>
<i>a promise. son.</i>

183
00:10:44.148 --> 00:10:46.313
I'm not yer frigging son!

184
00:10:46.348 --> 00:10:48.722
<i> To delete</i>
<i>all old messages.</i>

185
00:10:48.757 --> 00:10:49.822
<i>press delete.</i>

186
00:10:49.857 --> 00:10:52.022
<i>All old messages deleted.</i>

187
00:10:55.995 --> 00:10:57.258
It's not so bad.

188
00:11:00.802 --> 00:11:02.769
Hey. you're safe with us.

189
00:11:02.804 --> 00:11:04.166
You know that. right?

190
00:11:04.201 --> 00:11:05.805
Yeah. I know. I just--

191
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.906
I just want to talk
about something else.

192
00:11:10.207 --> 00:11:12.438
-Shots?

193
00:11:12.473 --> 00:11:14.110
Of course.

194
00:11:19.315 --> 00:11:22.151
Anyone else
getting in the pool?

195
00:11:22.186 --> 00:11:25.220
-Faye?
-Maybe later.

196
00:11:27.092 --> 00:11:28.861
This blows.

197
00:11:28.896 --> 00:11:30.258
I wanted to float the river.

198
00:11:30.293 --> 00:11:31.831
You can float in the pool.

199
00:11:31.866 --> 00:11:33.525
Yeah. it's not quite the same.

200
00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.363
Remember how it's like 40 of
us squished in. like sardines?

201
00:11:36.398 --> 00:11:38.200
Yeah. but at least
we're not gator food

202
00:11:38.235 --> 00:11:39.498
because that
would ruin the vibe.

203
00:11:39.533 --> 00:11:41.335
Yeah.

204
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:43.337
Remember when that lady
dove into the shallow end

205
00:11:43.372 --> 00:11:45.504
of the river and
cracked her head open?

206
00:11:45.539 --> 00:11:47.440
Samantha Caldwell.

207
00:11:47.475 --> 00:11:50.311
Yeah. Samantha.

208
00:11:50.346 --> 00:11:52.346
Didn't she win the
lottery the next day. too?

209
00:11:52.381 --> 00:11:54.249
Yeah. a cool million.

210
00:11:54.284 --> 00:11:57.120
She didn't need the
program after that. I guess.

211
00:11:57.155 --> 00:11:59.793
When's the next
retreat going to be Wendy?

212
00:11:59.828 --> 00:12:01.927
Is it too late to
request Hot Springs?

213
00:12:01.962 --> 00:12:03.929
There won't be
any more retreats.

214
00:12:03.964 --> 00:12:06.800
-What?
-Huh?

215
00:12:06.835 --> 00:12:08.329
What?

216
00:12:09.365 --> 00:12:11.431
The city
cancelled the whole program.

217
00:12:13.336 --> 00:12:15.501
Didn't even take a vote.

218
00:12:16.504 --> 00:12:18.471
Why?

219
00:12:18.506 --> 00:12:21.078
They wanted to amp up
police at our sister shelters.

220
00:12:21.113 --> 00:12:23.542
And I fought them on it.

221
00:12:25.414 --> 00:12:26.787
Hard.

222
00:12:28.153 --> 00:12:29.988
They knew the
retreat was my baby.

223
00:12:30.023 --> 00:12:32.485
so they shut it
down and fired me.

224
00:12:33.092 --> 00:12:34.927
I knew something was up

225
00:12:34.962 --> 00:12:37.061
when you stopped sending the
newsletter. like Halloween.

226
00:12:38.196 --> 00:12:40.031
Why wouldn't you tell us?

227
00:12:41.496 --> 00:12:42.869
Guilt?

228
00:12:44.136 --> 00:12:45.399
Shame.

229
00:12:47.403 --> 00:12:49.238
Especially when I lost the car.

230
00:12:49.273 --> 00:12:50.569
-You lost the car?
-Wait. is that why

231
00:12:50.604 --> 00:12:52.175
you took the shuttle?

232
00:12:53.376 --> 00:12:55.112
You know better than that.

233
00:12:55.917 --> 00:12:57.345
If I have a ride.
you have a ride.

234
00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.017
If I have a couch.
you have a couch.

235
00:12:59.052 --> 00:13:01.052
If she has chips. I have chips.

236
00:13:02.187 --> 00:13:04.055
Sharing is caring. remember?

237
00:13:05.322 --> 00:13:07.223
You have to let us know.

238
00:13:16.465 --> 00:13:18.333
If you had me
like that--

239
00:13:18.368 --> 00:13:20.533
-Yeah.
-Like around here.

240
00:13:20.568 --> 00:13:22.040
like this
and then I push it down.

241
00:13:22.075 --> 00:13:23.470
-I feel that.
-You do? Okay.

242
00:13:23.505 --> 00:13:25.010
Try it. ready?

243
00:13:25.045 --> 00:13:26.143
Boop.

244
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.178
Oh. Ah. Yeah.

245
00:13:28.213 --> 00:13:29.608
-Did I do it?
-Yeah. you did it. nailed it.

246
00:13:29.643 --> 00:13:31.148
You're just saying that.

247
00:13:31.183 --> 00:13:33.282
No. if you do it like that...

248
00:13:52.006 --> 00:13:54.039
And feel.

249
00:13:58.144 --> 00:14:00.474
Ah. shit.

250
00:14:00.509 --> 00:14:05.017
Wendy. did you
bring any toilet paper?

251
00:14:06.251 --> 00:14:07.987
Wendy?

252
00:14:34.378 --> 00:14:37.049
Why would she be down here?

253
00:14:37.084 --> 00:14:38.413
Wendy?

254
00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.548
Wendy?

255
00:14:41.583 --> 00:14:42.648
Hey.

256
00:14:42.683 --> 00:14:44.518
Wendy?

257
00:14:44.553 --> 00:14:46.322
What are you doing over here?

258
00:14:46.357 --> 00:14:48.324
Oh. my God.
it smells like death.

259
00:14:48.359 --> 00:14:49.490
Ooh. yup.

260
00:14:49.525 --> 00:14:52.295
You having fun without us?

261
00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.000
I'm not asking you
to agree with me.

262
00:14:54.035 --> 00:14:55.661
but please
don't try to stop me.

263
00:14:56.763 --> 00:14:59.104
Are these fried fish scales?

264
00:14:59.139 --> 00:15:01.667
-Are you tripping without us?
-No.

265
00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:06.078
Remember how Samantha Caldwell
cracked her head open

266
00:15:06.113 --> 00:15:08.509
-and won the lottery?
-Yeah.

267
00:15:10.084 --> 00:15:11.545
That's because
she bled in this river.

268
00:15:13.648 --> 00:15:16.022
These waters are sacred.

269
00:15:16.057 --> 00:15:17.991
They belong to Erzulie.

270
00:15:18.026 --> 00:15:20.389
Mrs. Lafitte told me
when she gave me the scales.

271
00:15:21.095 --> 00:15:23.029
These fish scales.

272
00:15:23.064 --> 00:15:25.658
These mermaid scales.

273
00:15:25.693 --> 00:15:27.693
So. according to Mrs. Lafitte.

274
00:15:27.728 --> 00:15:31.433
this is a sacred river that
belongs to the goddess Erzulie.

275
00:15:32.436 --> 00:15:35.767
And if we bleed in it.
she'll grant our wishes.

276
00:15:35.802 --> 00:15:37.571
It's up to her to decide.

277
00:15:37.606 --> 00:15:40.211
But she's known to favor
and protect women and children.

278
00:15:40.246 --> 00:15:42.642
Look. it says right here.

279
00:15:42.677 --> 00:15:46.745
"She who pours her
hearts water in the river.

280
00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:51.552
joins her heart to Erzulie
as all rivers join the sea."

281
00:15:51.587 --> 00:15:56.590
-And so right now. you are--
-Erzulie is here in this river.

282
00:15:56.625 --> 00:15:59.791
If Samantha Caldwell can
get her blessings. I can too.

283
00:15:59.826 --> 00:16:02.464
Okay and so this is why you're
dressed like Miss Cleo.

284
00:16:02.499 --> 00:16:04.697
That's why you can
respect the process.

285
00:16:04.732 --> 00:16:06.435
-Thank you. Violet.
-What are you doing?

286
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:09.438
Get out of the water. crazy.

287
00:16:09.473 --> 00:16:10.571
Mother of waters...

288
00:16:10.606 --> 00:16:12.507
Intervention?

289
00:16:12.542 --> 00:16:14.311
Receive this salt.

290
00:16:14.346 --> 00:16:17.050
-We should stop her. right?
-And know my sacrifice.

291
00:16:17.085 --> 00:16:19.415
I don't know. when things
were really bad with James.

292
00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:22.055
I started going
to this palm reader.

293
00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:23.716
So maybe it's
kind of like that.

294
00:16:23.751 --> 00:16:27.720
Receive this earth
and know my journey.

295
00:16:27.755 --> 00:16:30.294
I mean. my aunt is
really into crystals.

296
00:16:31.693 --> 00:16:35.167
Yeah. this is more
of an active delusion.

297
00:16:35.202 --> 00:16:36.729
Receive this blood.

298
00:16:39.767 --> 00:16:41.569
And know my desire.

299
00:16:44.244 --> 00:16:45.738
Send your daughter to bless me.

300
00:16:47.544 --> 00:16:49.544
Send your daughter. Erzulie.

301
00:16:49.579 --> 00:16:51.513
Oh. I don't know.
I think we can

302
00:16:51.548 --> 00:16:53.812
just be supportive and she'll
wrap it up soon.

303
00:16:55.684 --> 00:16:57.486
Stupid...

304
00:17:05.265 --> 00:17:06.726
What?

305
00:17:06.761 --> 00:17:08.167
Wow.

306
00:17:10.798 --> 00:17:12.105
How did you do that?

307
00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.568
Change your minds?

308
00:17:13.603 --> 00:17:15.372
Grab some earth. come on.

309
00:17:17.706 --> 00:17:19.376
She's a goddess.

310
00:17:19.411 --> 00:17:21.543
Do you think she can.
like. talk to the dead?

311
00:17:21.578 --> 00:17:23.446
You can ask.

312
00:17:24.647 --> 00:17:26.317
Take the salt.

313
00:17:36.362 --> 00:17:38.164
Oh. God.

314
00:17:39.629 --> 00:17:41.167
Faye?

315
00:17:41.202 --> 00:17:44.137
Oh. I can't.
I'm going to stay here.

316
00:17:44.766 --> 00:17:46.832
She could help
make you feel safe again.

317
00:17:46.867 --> 00:17:48.471
That isn't safe for me.

318
00:17:50.178 --> 00:17:51.672
It's fine. I'm just
going to be over here.

319
00:17:51.707 --> 00:17:53.146
Call me when you're done.

320
00:17:53.181 --> 00:17:55.346
I don't want
to walk home alone.

321
00:18:01.519 --> 00:18:03.354
-Okay.
-Right.

322
00:18:07.459 --> 00:18:10.328
Yeah. when we get home. I
call dibs on the shower.

323
00:18:10.363 --> 00:18:11.593
I'll arm wrestle you for it.

324
00:18:11.628 --> 00:18:13.397
Yeah. well. jokes on you.

325
00:18:13.432 --> 00:18:14.563
Because I'm asking this
goddess for super strength.

326
00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.204
Do you guys hear that?

327
00:18:19.603 --> 00:18:21.273
Erzulie.

328
00:18:21.308 --> 00:18:22.604
Erzulie.

329
00:18:23.871 --> 00:18:25.574
Erzulie.

330
00:18:26.544 --> 00:18:27.873
Erzulie.

331
00:18:27.908 --> 00:18:29.578
Erzulie.

332
00:18:29.613 --> 00:18:30.678
Erzulie.

333
00:18:30.713 --> 00:18:32.317
That does it. too far!

334
00:18:32.352 --> 00:18:35.221
Wait. we are almost finished.

335
00:18:35.256 --> 00:18:36.354
It could be her.

336
00:18:36.389 --> 00:18:37.784
Wendy. get out.

337
00:18:37.819 --> 00:18:39.588
Erzulie!

338
00:18:39.623 --> 00:18:40.919
Faye!

339
00:18:40.954 --> 00:18:42.360
Faye!

340
00:18:58.444 --> 00:18:59.509
Oh. my God.

341
00:18:59.544 --> 00:19:00.609
Wait. wait. wait.

342
00:19:00.644 --> 00:19:02.842
Careful. I just cut myself.

343
00:19:04.483 --> 00:19:05.614
There is someone there.

344
00:19:05.649 --> 00:19:07.319
Should we ask them some help?

345
00:19:07.354 --> 00:19:08.980
No. are you kidding?

346
00:19:09.015 --> 00:19:10.553
He looks sketchy.

347
00:19:10.588 --> 00:19:12.522
I'm just-- Hold on.

348
00:19:15.494 --> 00:19:17.824
I thought I heard something.

349
00:19:17.859 --> 00:19:20.299
Anyway. I'll keep you posted.

350
00:19:21.434 --> 00:19:24.468
Shh. shh. shh.

351
00:19:41.322 --> 00:19:42.387
Sorry this hurts.

352
00:19:43.951 --> 00:19:47.260
-Hey. you.
-Thanks.

353
00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:59.536
I didn't mean for
anyone to get hurt.

354
00:19:59.571 --> 00:20:01.901
Yeah. except Faye almost
got her leg ripped off.

355
00:20:01.936 --> 00:20:03.771
Well. I didn't
ask you to be there.

356
00:20:05.676 --> 00:20:08.413
That's kind of
part of the problem.

357
00:20:11.979 --> 00:20:14.452
When do we know
if the spell worked?

358
00:20:14.487 --> 00:20:15.849
I don't know.

359
00:20:16.852 --> 00:20:19.050
I thought Erzulie would
appear at the river.

360
00:20:19.085 --> 00:20:20.953
All this was for nothing?

361
00:20:20.988 --> 00:20:22.625

00:44:59.168 --> 00:45:01.102
Is this a map of the property?

718
00:45:01.137 --> 00:45:02.433
Hey. hey.

719
00:45:02.468 --> 00:45:03.973
Can I see that for a
second. please?

720
00:45:04.008 --> 00:45:05.942
Please. thank you.

721
00:45:05.977 --> 00:45:07.273
All right.

722
00:45:07.308 --> 00:45:08.538
How about we
don't ask any questions

723
00:45:08.573 --> 00:45:10.782
and we never saw each other?

724
00:45:10.817 --> 00:45:11.981
-That's fine by me.
-Great.

725
00:45:12.016 --> 00:45:13.510
-Awesome.
-All right.

726
00:45:13.545 --> 00:45:16.117
Oh and Mrs. Lafitte
said I could take this. too.

727
00:45:16.152 --> 00:45:18.053
Sure. have fun with that.

728
00:45:18.088 --> 00:45:19.318
I'll leave you to it.

729
00:45:19.353 --> 00:45:20.957
-Thank you.
-Peace out.

730
00:45:21.322 --> 00:45:23.190
Oh. what the hell.

731
00:45:30.903 --> 00:45:33.904
Okay. oh.
I got us wheels.

732
00:45:33.939 --> 00:45:35.334
Okay.

733
00:45:35.567 --> 00:45:37.204
Where's Faye and Violet?

734
00:45:37.239 --> 00:45:38.337
They went back
to the cabin.

735
00:45:39.571 --> 00:45:41.208
Okay. well. we're not alone.

736
00:45:41.243 --> 00:45:43.045
There's some dude
snooping at river house. so--

737
00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:45.476
-Does he know what we're up to?
-Not. yet.

738
00:45:45.511 --> 00:45:47.511
I kind of want to
know what he is up to.

739
00:45:48.954 --> 00:45:50.052
Now is not the time.

740
00:45:50.087 --> 00:45:51.515
Um. excuse me.

741
00:45:51.550 --> 00:45:54.023
Goddess.
Ma'am. I just want to--

742
00:45:54.058 --> 00:45:56.553
Okay. one. two. three.

743
00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:07.432
♪

744
00:46:18.445 --> 00:46:20.214
Damn.

745
00:46:49.542 --> 00:46:50.882
Oh. they're here.

746
00:46:58.023 --> 00:47:00.122
Oh. shit. that was fast.

747
00:47:15.436 --> 00:47:17.634
They're watching.

748
00:47:22.575 --> 00:47:24.443
<i>This person cannot be reached</i>

749
00:47:24.478 --> 00:47:26.511
<i>at the moment. please leave a</i>
<i>message after the tone.</i>

750
00:47:28.185 --> 00:47:29.921
Pickup. uh--
oh. you can't pick up.

751
00:47:29.956 --> 00:47:32.451
this is voicemail.
uh. call me back.

752
00:47:32.486 --> 00:47:35.058
I'm breathing because I don't
have my ATV. they've taken it.

753
00:47:35.093 --> 00:47:36.554
And they
knew exactly where the key was.

754
00:47:36.589 --> 00:47:38.930
<i> Boss? Boss?</i>

755
00:47:38.965 --> 00:47:40.327
<i>Hey. I can hear you--</i>

756
00:47:40.362 --> 00:47:42.032
Is that what I think it is?

757
00:47:42.067 --> 00:47:43.495
<i>Where-- where are you?</i>

758
00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:45.365
Oh. my God.
Oh. I can't believe it.

759
00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:46.465
<i>What're you talking about?</i>

760
00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:47.631
She was right.

761
00:47:47.666 --> 00:47:49.171
<i> Boss?</i>

762
00:47:49.206 --> 00:47:51.074
She was right.

763
00:47:53.441 --> 00:47:55.177
<i> Oh. my God. Oh. my God.</i>

764
00:47:55.212 --> 00:47:57.146
Did you not hear her
offer us our hearts' desires?

765
00:47:57.181 --> 00:47:59.478
I mean.
don't you want in on that?

766
00:47:59.513 --> 00:48:01.579
She killed James. Violet.

767
00:48:03.748 --> 00:48:06.452
Vi. need a hand!

768
00:48:07.719 --> 00:48:09.620
What if it was self-defense?

769
00:48:09.655 --> 00:48:12.128
-Violet.
-I'm coming.

770
00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.969
I'll be right back. okay?

771
00:48:25.110 --> 00:48:28.045
I'm drying her
off so her legs appear.

772
00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:29.574
-<i> Splash. </i> anyone?
-Okay. that's great.

773
00:48:29.609 --> 00:48:31.477
But we have
even bigger problems.

774
00:48:31.512 --> 00:48:33.611
Bigger than
being framed for murder?

775
00:48:33.646 --> 00:48:35.580
That biohazard
map I saw.

776
00:48:35.615 --> 00:48:38.220
like. who knows what
we've been exposed to.

777
00:48:38.255 --> 00:48:41.058
Our skin is
probably going to fall off.

778
00:48:41.093 --> 00:48:43.027
She's right.

779
00:48:43.062 --> 00:48:44.754
It won't be long before
someone comes to question us.

780
00:48:44.789 --> 00:48:47.097
Well. should we return
the stolen ATV?

781
00:48:47.132 --> 00:48:50.430
Borrowed. Too late. I'm pretty
sure Rhett .

782
00:48:50.465 --> 00:48:52.267
So we're just going to
leave it parked out front.

783
00:48:52.302 --> 00:48:54.236
What is our alibi for that?

784
00:48:54.271 --> 00:48:56.601
Maybe we needed transportation

785
00:48:56.636 --> 00:48:58.207
because Faye
sprained her ankle.

786
00:48:58.242 --> 00:49:00.374
-Leave me out of it.
-No. no. no.

787
00:49:00.409 --> 00:49:02.112
Shouldn't we say
we were here all day?

788
00:49:02.147 --> 00:49:04.147
My fingerprints
are all over the lobby.

789
00:49:04.182 --> 00:49:07.018
No. we can say we went in to
get help and no one was there.

790
00:49:07.053 --> 00:49:09.416
Which is true.
so we borrowed the ATV.

791
00:49:09.451 --> 00:49:11.088
The call history will match up.

792
00:49:11.123 --> 00:49:13.057
Then we went on a
first aid run and we were here

793
00:49:13.092 --> 00:49:14.157
the rest of the night.

794
00:49:14.192 --> 00:49:15.686
I said. leave me out of it.

795
00:49:15.721 --> 00:49:17.424
I'm not going to lie for her.

796
00:49:17.459 --> 00:49:18.755
If your story
doesn't match ours.

797
00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:20.493
then we'll all be suspect.

798
00:49:20.528 --> 00:49:22.033
Well. then maybe we
should just tell the truth.

799
00:49:22.068 --> 00:49:23.298
What is it that
you don't understand

800
00:49:23.333 --> 00:49:25.267
about needing to keep this
a secret?

801
00:49:25.302 --> 00:49:28.666
I'm not going to risk my life
so that you can do black magic.

802
00:49:28.701 --> 00:49:30.140
Not when you
clearly couldn't care less

803
00:49:30.175 --> 00:49:31.603
about me or my happiness.

804
00:49:31.638 --> 00:49:33.374
Faye!

805
00:49:33.409 --> 00:49:35.310
No and you. did you
not see his guts in the pool?

806
00:49:35.345 --> 00:49:37.477
Did that look like
self-defense to you?

807
00:49:37.512 --> 00:49:39.776
No. that was human sacrifice.

808
00:49:39.811 --> 00:49:42.119
The fact that you're all
here pampering her instead

809
00:49:42.154 --> 00:49:46.123
of losing your minds tells
me everything I need to know.

810
00:49:46.158 --> 00:49:48.686
We've got a once in a
lifetime chance here. Faye.

811
00:49:48.721 --> 00:49:50.754
You've got to learn to
see that for what it is.

812
00:49:50.789 --> 00:49:52.690
It's-- it's a miracle.

813
00:49:52.725 --> 00:49:54.395
We have to stick together.

814
00:49:55.827 --> 00:49:57.167
Are you coming?

815
00:49:57.202 --> 00:49:58.630
There's nowhere to go.

816
00:49:58.665 --> 00:50:01.468
I will walk to a payphone
and I will call a cab.

817
00:50:01.503 --> 00:50:04.339
You seriously want her
blessing after what she did?

818
00:50:04.374 --> 00:50:06.737
I harmed you.

819
00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:09.047
Whoa.

820
00:50:10.215 --> 00:50:12.611
Erzulie.

821
00:50:15.253 --> 00:50:18.650
That was never my intention.

822
00:50:20.324 --> 00:50:21.653
But you...

823
00:50:26.858 --> 00:50:29.199
You will never know peace.

824
00:50:31.137 --> 00:50:34.600
Unless you can admit
your hearts' desires.

825
00:50:42.214 --> 00:50:48.548
It's your blood that
screams to me of freedom.

826
00:50:51.916 --> 00:50:53.586
Did I not rescue you?

827
00:50:54.259 --> 00:50:55.324
No!

828
00:50:56.525 --> 00:50:59.691
No. I didn't ask
to be rescued.

829
00:50:59.726 --> 00:51:02.760
I-- I didn't ask to be
protected.

830
00:51:02.795 --> 00:51:04.861
I never wanted that.

831
00:51:04.896 --> 00:51:09.767
I did. I'm sorry. I didn't
want him dead. I swear.

832
00:51:09.802 --> 00:51:12.704
I just-- I just wanted
you safe and happy.

833
00:51:13.476 --> 00:51:14.640
I release you.

834
00:51:17.282 --> 00:51:21.713
Faye! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

835
00:51:22.287 --> 00:51:24.287
What gave
you the right. Violet?

836
00:51:26.687 --> 00:51:29.226
A debt has not been paid.

837
00:51:29.756 --> 00:51:30.788
Please.

838
00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:32.823
You don't owe us anything.

839
00:51:35.465 --> 00:51:37.861
I think we need to look out
for ourselves from here on out.

840
00:51:40.503 --> 00:51:42.239
Is this your desire?

841
00:51:54.451 --> 00:51:55.879
It is.

842
00:52:21.610 --> 00:52:24.314
Probably should have
asked for a cure for cancer.

843
00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:28.780
Or help with the dead body.
Whatever.

844
00:52:32.555 --> 00:52:34.687
I'll pretend I have
the sprained ankle.

845
00:52:35.624 --> 00:52:37.195
If anyone asks.

846
00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:39.626
That will last
about two seconds.

847
00:52:40.761 --> 00:52:42.464
I'm not actually gonna
to sprain it.

848
00:52:43.368 --> 00:52:44.994
Can we please tell
the truth now?

849
00:52:45.029 --> 00:52:47.865
We're not selling out
a Goddess to the police!

850
00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:49.636
Why are you choosing
her over us?

851
00:52:49.671 --> 00:52:51.407
She's not even human!

852
00:52:51.442 --> 00:52:53.970
How is she the monster
in your eyes and not James?!

853
00:52:54.005 --> 00:52:55.708
I loved him!

854
00:52:55.743 --> 00:52:57.006
You were
a counselor.

855
00:52:57.041 --> 00:52:58.678
how do you not
understand that?!

856
00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:06.290
Go upstairs.

857
00:53:06.325 --> 00:53:07.456
Go upstairs.

858
00:53:12.562 --> 00:53:15.893
Oh. Hello.

859
00:53:15.928 --> 00:53:17.829
Uh. is everything all right?

860
00:53:17.864 --> 00:53:18.995
I heard raised voices.

861
00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:21.569
Oh. that's my fault.

862
00:53:21.604 --> 00:53:23.769
I always turn
on the TV too loud.

863
00:53:23.804 --> 00:53:25.001
I didn't wake you?

864
00:53:25.036 --> 00:53:26.706
-Oh. no. no.
-Did I?

865
00:53:26.741 --> 00:53:28.774
That's not why
I was here. I was. uh...

866
00:53:29.678 --> 00:53:33.350
I'm here 'cause--
Actually. while I am here.

867
00:53:33.385 --> 00:53:34.780
you want to tell me
why my all-terrain vehicle

868
00:53:34.815 --> 00:53:36.584
is parked
in your garden?

869
00:53:36.619 --> 00:53:38.850
Oh. he didn't tell you? I
thought somebody left a mess--

870
00:53:38.885 --> 00:53:40.720
-No. nobody left me a message.
-Oh.

871
00:53:40.755 --> 00:53:43.921
How embarrassing. I--
Um. we had a little accident.

872
00:53:43.956 --> 00:53:45.824
Nothing major.

873
00:53:45.859 --> 00:53:48.728
My friend sprained her ankle
and we needed to get her back

874
00:53:48.763 --> 00:53:49.828
to the cabin.

875
00:53:49.863 --> 00:53:51.467
And you weren't here.

876
00:53:51.502 --> 00:53:54.305
I-- Is that okay?
We really did try and call.

877
00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:57.737
You know. I-- I do not like
that you just helped yourself

878
00:53:57.772 --> 00:53:59.607
to the-- the rental equipment.

879
00:53:59.642 --> 00:54:02.610
But I-- I apologize that I was
not available to help you.

880
00:54:03.041 --> 00:54:04.513
Does your friend
need a doctor?

881
00:54:04.548 --> 00:54:05.976
Oh. no.

882
00:54:06.011 --> 00:54:08.979
No. she's sleeping it off.
um. but thank you.

883
00:54:09.014 --> 00:54:10.816
Let me get you that key.

884
00:54:15.658 --> 00:54:17.295
So sorry about...

885
00:54:18.122 --> 00:54:19.396
the mix-up.

886
00:54:19.893 --> 00:54:20.925
Yeah.

887
00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:23.796
Did you enjoy the pool?

888
00:54:24.436 --> 00:54:26.931
Yes. well. briefly.

889
00:54:26.966 --> 00:54:28.966
That was before
my friend slipped.

890
00:54:29.001 --> 00:54:30.407
Oh. what a shame.

891
00:54:31.641 --> 00:54:32.904
She'll be all right.

892
00:54:32.939 --> 00:54:35.544
Uh. she'll--
She's sleeping it off.

893
00:54:35.579 --> 00:54:36.941
We promise not to sue.

894
00:54:36.976 --> 00:54:40.747
Sue!
That's pretty funny.

895
00:54:40.782 --> 00:54:42.947
Well. thank you. I--
I appreciate that very much.

896
00:54:44.115 --> 00:54:45.620
You know. I checked my phone

897
00:54:45.655 --> 00:54:48.392
and it seems that
the only time I missed

898
00:54:48.427 --> 00:54:51.626
a call was right around...
four o'clock.

899
00:54:52.893 --> 00:54:55.498
That-- That sounds about right.

900
00:54:55.533 --> 00:54:57.335
-Four o'clock?
-Mm-hmm.

901
00:54:58.602 --> 00:55:02.835
Don't you think it's funny that
your porch would still be wet?

902
00:55:04.839 --> 00:55:06.036
Whoa!

903
00:55:17.819 --> 00:55:18.884
Now...

904
00:55:20.591 --> 00:55:22.525
are you going to be
the one to take the fall

905
00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:23.757
for the body that's
in the pool?

906
00:55:29.468 --> 00:55:31.061
Are you going to tell
me where the mermaid is?

907
00:55:38.807 --> 00:55:41.005
Where's all your little
lesbian girlfriends?

908
00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:42.776
They're sleeping.

909
00:55:42.811 --> 00:55:44.811
Please. I-- I don't know
what you're talking about.

910
00:55:49.048 --> 00:55:50.146
Please. I...

911
00:55:51.886 --> 00:55:53.017
What are you doing?

912
00:55:55.186 --> 00:55:56.559
Mmm.

913
00:55:58.596 --> 00:56:00.530
I know the smell of fish
when I smell it.

914
00:56:04.602 --> 00:56:05.667
Open it.

915
00:56:08.474 --> 00:56:09.836
Open it.

916
00:56:09.871 --> 00:56:11.035
Open it!

917
00:56:11.070 --> 00:56:12.806
-Okay.

918
00:56:14.975 --> 00:56:16.040
Yeah.

919
00:56:18.011 --> 00:56:21.177
The whole town thought
she was-- she was touched.

920
00:56:21.784 --> 00:56:23.916
But my dad was a fool
for letting her run her mouth

921
00:56:23.951 --> 00:56:24.983
on and on.

922
00:56:25.689 --> 00:56:26.787
But the mermaid...

923
00:56:27.218 --> 00:56:28.492
Your mother?

924
00:56:29.661 --> 00:56:33.464
Stepmother. She is not my
mother. she's my stepmother.

925
00:56:33.499 --> 00:56:34.564
Open it.

926
00:56:42.167 --> 00:56:43.232
Open it.

927
00:56:50.043 --> 00:56:51.779
-Where is she?!

928
00:56:51.814 --> 00:56:55.112
Erzulie's gone. okay?
She left. we sent her away.

929
00:56:55.147 --> 00:56:57.015
Oh. oh. yeah. sent her away.

930
00:56:57.050 --> 00:56:59.886
Because that's
exactly what everyone

931
00:56:59.921 --> 00:57:03.560
does when they find out
that mermaids actually exist.

932
00:57:03.595 --> 00:57:05.089
They just--
They just send them away.

933
00:57:05.124 --> 00:57:06.893
We didn't want any trouble.

934
00:57:06.928 --> 00:57:08.631
We didn't mean for anything
to get out of hand.

935
00:57:21.943 --> 00:57:25.516
Well. I guess
they're not asleep

936
00:57:25.551 --> 00:57:26.616
like you said they were.

937
00:57:28.554 --> 00:57:29.916
She's gone.

938
00:57:29.951 --> 00:57:32.149
See. the others had
nothing to do with this.

939
00:57:49.674 --> 00:57:51.135
... understand why we
aren't calling the police.

940
00:57:51.907 --> 00:57:53.302
You think you are
some kind of heroes. huh?

941
00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:56.107
Hiding that freak!

942
00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:00.914
You think she's some type
of mystical feminine protector?

943
00:58:00.949 --> 00:58:02.586
She's nothing
but a maneater!

944
00:58:02.621 --> 00:58:04.049
That kid in the pool's
going to be like every man

945
00:58:04.084 --> 00:58:07.283
-in your life.

946
00:58:07.318 --> 00:58:09.153
Wow.

947
00:58:09.188 --> 00:58:10.924
Wow. I never thought I'd
see the day that Wendy Woloft

948
00:58:10.959 --> 00:58:12.321
shoved a sock
in a hostage's mouth.

949
00:58:12.356 --> 00:58:14.092
He was gonna shoot us. Faye.

950
00:58:14.127 --> 00:58:16.226
He doesn't get to keep
the moral high ground. okay?

951
00:58:16.261 --> 00:58:18.294
Listen. there's no talking
our way out of this now.

952
00:58:18.329 --> 00:58:21.033
So. I say we leave
and don't look back.

953
00:58:21.772 --> 00:58:24.575
Listen. I have
some cousins in New Mexico.

954
00:58:24.610 --> 00:58:26.005
they'll give us
a place to stay.

955
00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:27.644
But if we leave him here
and nobody finds him.

956
00:58:27.679 --> 00:58:29.613
that's more blood on our hands.

957
00:58:29.648 --> 00:58:31.340
We can call in an anonymous tip
once we're at a safe distance.

958
00:58:31.375 --> 00:58:33.716
No! Wha-- We're just gonna
leave and go to

959
00:58:33.751 --> 00:58:35.212
New Mexico?

960
00:58:35.247 --> 00:58:36.950
And then we're just
gonna start over?

961
00:58:36.985 --> 00:58:38.655
How would that even work?

962
00:58:38.690 --> 00:58:40.283
Don't know. Faye.
let's figure it out in the car.

963
00:58:40.318 --> 00:58:43.121
I'm sorry. but not all of us
can just drop everything

964
00:58:43.156 --> 00:58:44.859
and drive to--
New Mexico

965
00:58:44.894 --> 00:58:47.026
and live like drifter burnouts.

966
00:58:47.061 --> 00:58:48.896
First of all. fuck you.

967
00:58:48.931 --> 00:58:51.701
Second of all. I don't care
where you drive us. Violet.

968
00:58:51.736 --> 00:58:54.033
As long as it's away from here.

969
00:58:54.068 --> 00:58:56.332
You're missing
the whole plan.

970
00:58:59.304 --> 00:59:01.007
Let's just go home.

971
00:59:01.042 --> 00:59:03.581
Let's just go home!

972
00:59:05.079 --> 00:59:06.617
I'll take
the fall for everything.

973
00:59:07.246 --> 00:59:08.652
I don't care anymore.

974
00:59:09.688 --> 00:59:11.017
-Wendy.
-I'm sorry.

975
00:59:17.663 --> 00:59:18.827
What is that?

976
00:59:34.405 --> 00:59:36.009
Hello.

977
00:59:37.441 --> 00:59:40.079
Ma'am. you-- you shouldn't
be swimming here.

978
00:59:41.214 --> 00:59:45.051
Actually. sorry. you really
shouldn't be anywhere

979
00:59:45.086 --> 00:59:46.690
near this water.

980
00:59:46.725 --> 00:59:49.022
It's dangerous and you don't
want to touch it.

981
00:59:49.057 --> 00:59:50.859
much less swim in it.

982
00:59:52.126 --> 00:59:55.765
Um. .
Stay right there.

983
00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:57.668
Don't move. don't move.
don't move. don't move.

984
00:59:59.463 --> 01:00:01.639
Hi. hi. hi.

985
01:00:03.467 --> 01:00:06.941
Hang on just one second.
Can I-- Can I just explain

986
01:00:06.976 --> 01:00:08.140
something to you. please?

987
01:00:08.175 --> 01:00:10.714
Look. there's a chemical plant.

988
01:00:10.749 --> 01:00:12.144
It's been dumping just upriver.

989
01:00:12.718 --> 01:00:14.278
I'm gonna try
to put this into a--

990
01:00:14.313 --> 01:00:15.686
I'm a bit
of an environmental--

991
01:00:15.721 --> 01:00:17.215
Oh. my God! Ma'am.

992
01:00:17.250 --> 01:00:18.381
Ma'am.

993
01:00:19.186 --> 01:00:22.759
Uh. the water is poison. okay?

994
01:00:24.092 --> 01:00:25.256
Can you just--

995
01:00:26.798 --> 01:00:28.325
You dropped this.

996
01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:30.030
Don't know how you don't fix
your trunk before a road trip.

997
01:00:30.065 --> 01:00:31.702
but whatever.

998
01:00:31.737 --> 01:00:33.000
I'll just put things back here.

999
01:00:33.035 --> 01:00:34.430
I think I left my charger.

1000
01:00:40.141 --> 01:00:41.305
Evening. ladies.

1001
01:00:42.913 --> 01:00:44.176
Is Rhett Lafitte in there?

1002
01:00:44.211 --> 01:00:45.342
Afraid not.

1003
01:00:48.116 --> 01:00:49.445
Well. that's his ATV.

1004
01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:52.283
Oh. no. we rented that one.

1005
01:00:53.385 --> 01:00:57.387
Uh. that sounds a little fishy
to me. don't it. Delmar?

1006
01:00:57.422 --> 01:01:01.424
Yeah. I mean Rhett don't let
nobody play with his toolbox.

1007
01:01:02.097 --> 01:01:03.261
-Yeah. not a soul.

1008
01:01:03.296 --> 01:01:04.900
-Fine.
-Whoa.

1009
01:01:04.935 --> 01:01:06.869
Listen. you seem kind
of confused.

1010
01:01:06.904 --> 01:01:08.299
Is there any way
that I can help you?

1011
01:01:10.303 --> 01:01:12.072
Yes.

1012
01:01:12.107 --> 01:01:13.876
What-- What-- Yes?

1013
01:01:13.911 --> 01:01:15.471
That-- That was--
That-- That's a yes.

1014
01:01:15.506 --> 01:01:17.407
I didn't know
you spoke English.

1015
01:01:19.543 --> 01:01:21.950
One of them took my gun.
it's in their shit.

1016
01:01:21.985 --> 01:01:23.314
I'm looking.

1017
01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:30.255
Found the gun!

1018
01:01:31.995 --> 01:01:33.060
And this.

1019
01:01:34.096 --> 01:01:35.524
What is it. boss?

1020
01:01:35.559 --> 01:01:36.965
I believe
that's genuine mermaid scales.

1021
01:01:37.429 --> 01:01:39.297
What? Are you high right now?

1022
01:01:39.332 --> 01:01:41.002
Little bit.

1023
01:01:41.037 --> 01:01:42.839
Did you call us out here
in the middle of the night

1024
01:01:42.874 --> 01:01:44.170
to tell us another one of your
mom's campfire stories?

1025
01:01:45.272 --> 01:01:46.502
She's not my mama.

1026
01:01:47.945 --> 01:01:49.076
And you don't believe me?

1027
01:01:49.111 --> 01:01:50.341
Look out by the pool.

1028
01:01:50.376 --> 01:01:53.377
There's a body up there

1029
01:01:53.412 --> 01:01:56.985
with its guts all hanging out.

1030
01:01:59.891 --> 01:02:01.187
Oh. booby.

1031
01:02:01.222 --> 01:02:02.485
What does this have
to do with them?

1032
01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:04.421
Witnesses. Loose ends.

1033
01:02:04.456 --> 01:02:07.391
No. you need us. You don't have
a clue of where to find her.

1034
01:02:07.426 --> 01:02:08.931
She's a mermaid. sweetheart.

1035
01:02:09.593 --> 01:02:11.164
She went towards the water.

1036
01:02:12.002 --> 01:02:15.102
Even if that's true.
I don't need all of them.

1037
01:02:15.137 --> 01:02:16.807
You'll never catch her
without us.

1038
01:02:16.842 --> 01:02:18.402
You don't even know
how to call her.

1039
01:02:18.437 --> 01:02:19.975
You have
the key in your hand

1040
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:21.405
and you don't even know
how to use it.

1041
01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:23.209
-Can you even read it?
-Shut her up so I can think.

1042
01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:28.049
You okay?

1043
01:02:30.251 --> 01:02:31.514
What's it say. boss?

1044
01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:34.957
I don't know.

1045
01:02:34.992 --> 01:02:36.057
Damn it.

1046
01:02:44.529 --> 01:02:45.561
Wendy.

1047
01:02:46.971 --> 01:02:49.070
Miss Know-It-All.
you're coming with us.

1048
01:02:49.105 --> 01:02:50.874
-No!

1049
01:02:50.909 --> 01:02:52.502
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

1050
01:02:52.537 --> 01:02:56.044
All right. since she's coming
with us. they can--

1051
01:02:56.079 --> 01:02:58.244
Well. shoot them.

1052
01:02:58.279 --> 01:03:00.312
You'll only make her--
You'll only make her angry!

1053
01:03:00.347 --> 01:03:01.984
Then you'll never
take her down.

1054
01:03:02.019 --> 01:03:03.854
We're bound to her
by blood.

1055
01:03:03.889 --> 01:03:06.054
Remember the stories. Rhett.
she was trying to warn you.

1056
01:03:06.089 --> 01:03:08.056
Your mother. she wasn't lying
when she said--

1057
01:03:08.091 --> 01:03:10.421
<i>Step. </i> Mother.
She's my stepmother.

1058
01:03:10.456 --> 01:03:12.456
What the hell
is she talking about?

1059
01:03:13.096 --> 01:03:14.161
-Rhett.
-Yeah. Rhett?

1060
01:03:15.164 --> 01:03:17.131
It sounds like your mom
put a hit out on you.

1061
01:03:17.166 --> 01:03:18.462
-No.

1062
01:03:18.497 --> 01:03:19.936
Call her
my mom more time.

1063
01:03:19.971 --> 01:03:21.036
I dare you.

1064
01:03:25.438 --> 01:03:27.273
But she's right.
They're bound by blood.

1065
01:03:28.408 --> 01:03:30.474
So. yay. congratulations.

1066

You just earned yourselves
an extra hour on Earth. Mm.

1067
01:03:37.021 --> 01:03:38.581
You better make it count.

1068
01:03:38.616 --> 01:03:39.857
Hmm?

1069
01:03:42.026 --> 01:03:44.422

01:03:50.331 --> 01:03:53.068
-Let's go.

1074
01:04:01.606 --> 01:04:04.046
.
You gon' make it.

1075
01:04:06.182 --> 01:04:08.644
So. there. guys.
that's where you set the trap.

1076
01:04:08.679 --> 01:04:11.383
The razor wire.
Here's where that frat boy

1077
01:04:11.418 --> 01:04:14.650
died. so she's got to have
a nest around here somewhere.

1078
01:04:18.194 --> 01:04:21.063
Smell that right there. Wendy.
That's the smell of money. huh?

1079
01:04:21.098 --> 01:04:23.164
-What is he up to?
-I told you to quit letting him

1080
01:04:23.199 --> 01:04:24.968
do that cocaine.

1081
01:04:25.003 --> 01:04:27.597
This is

-All right.
-Wait. so what are we doing?

1086
01:04:44.418 --> 01:04:46.550
Well. right now. what you have
to do is go get that net.

1087
01:04:46.585 --> 01:04:47.650
because we're gon' trap her.

1088
01:04:47.685 --> 01:04:49.421
Oh. my God.

1089
01:04:49.456 --> 01:04:52.094
-Trap her like a crawfish.
-I like crawfish.

Oh. man. what was that?

1093
01:05:08.607 --> 01:05:11.278
Shut up. Let's go.

1094
01:05:11.313 --> 01:05:13.346
Dusty. you know I've been
scared of the dark ever since

1095
01:05:13.381 --> 01:05:16.349
we've been little kids.
Oh. man. I...

1096
01:05:18.023 --> 01:05:20.122
I am tired of being his
cokehead bodyguard.

1097
01:05:20.718 --> 01:05:22.993
I hate these hours!

1098
01:05:24.491 --> 01:05:28.328
That's the part you don't like?
Not the fact that we're on

1099
01:05:28.363 --> 01:05:30.363
some sort of wild<i> D&D</i>
goose chase?

1100
01:05:31.597 --> 01:05:35.467
Yeah. I'm just
saying it's weird. You know?

1101
01:05:35.502 --> 01:05:37.634
That kid did get ate out there.

1102
01:05:37.669 --> 01:05:39.537
And ain't nobody ever seen no
alligator up in this river.

1103
01:05:39.572 --> 01:05:41.605
You know that.

1104
01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:44.212
How does that make
killer swamp mermaid

1105
01:05:44.247 --> 01:05:46.049
the next logical answer?

1106
01:05:46.084 --> 01:05:47.116
-I don't know.
-Think!

1107
01:05:48.219 --> 01:05:50.086
Let's just tell him we did it
and get out of here.

1108
01:05:50.121 --> 01:05:51.285
Here. come on.

1109

We need the money. let's go.
Come on.

Oh. no.

1114
01:06:05.598 --> 01:06:08.764
-Oh. oh! Oh. God.

1115
01:06:10.108 --> 01:06:11.602
I don't know if this
is the best time.

1116
01:06:11.637 --> 01:06:13.274
but I got a take a leak.

1117
01:06:13.309 --> 01:06:16.409
Don't--
Don't leave me down here!

1118
01:06:16.444 --> 01:06:18.180
Just. uh. stand tight.
Hold on.

1119
01:06:22.648 --> 01:06:24.450
You gotta be kidding me.

But just. like. I just want you
to know that I'm not prepared

1123

I know the owners.

1124
01:06:38.565 --> 01:06:41.302
Yep. That's what I'll do.
Good talk.
