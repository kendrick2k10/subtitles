00:01:44.102 --> 00:01:45.631
In the beginning.

13
00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:49.668
everything feels so alive and...

14
00:01:49.668 --> 00:01:51.406
exciting.

15
00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:59.414
But time makes it predictable.

16
00:02:03.187 --> 00:02:05.585
He doesn’t really
see me anymore.

17
00:02:08.291 --> 00:02:11.657
It’s as if he’s replaced me
with someone else.

18
00:02:15.331 --> 00:02:19.302
I’ve lost those parts
of who I am...

19
00:02:19.302 --> 00:02:21.238
or who I could be.

20
00:02:23.537 --> 00:02:27.442
And... I’m scared
I won’t ever get them back.

21
00:02:30.148 --> 00:02:32.216
Maybe I shouldn’t
be telling you this.

22
00:02:37.287 --> 00:02:40.752
Another 500.000
people have been displaced

23
00:02:40.752 --> 00:02:42.457
by the vast tornado systems

24
00:02:42.457 --> 00:02:45.130
wreaking havoc
on Central and Western Europe.

25
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.330
European leaders
have described the storms

26
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.233
as catastrophic
in scale and power...

27
00:02:49.233 --> 00:02:51.598
The warning period
for severe heat and drought

28
00:02:51.598 --> 00:02:55.338
has been extended again
to nearly 60 million Americans

29
00:02:55.338 --> 00:02:58.176
under the Federal Government’s
Climate Alert System.

30
00:03:05.414 --> 00:03:07.416
...or underlying
health conditions

31
00:03:07.416 --> 00:03:09.418
are reminded
to take extra precautions

32
00:03:09.418 --> 00:03:12.157
and remain indoors
when possible.

33
00:04:46.812 --> 00:04:48.484
Hen?

34
00:04:50.651 --> 00:04:52.290
Hen!

35
00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.557
You expecting anyone?

36
00:05:03.598 --> 00:05:05.798
What? What is it?

37
00:05:05.798 --> 00:05:07.569
Didn’t hear you come in.

38
00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.773
Someone’s here.
- Oh.

39
00:05:13.773 --> 00:05:15.775
Looks official. doesn’t it?

40
00:05:15.775 --> 00:05:17.843
Yeah. could be.

41
00:05:17.843 --> 00:05:20.516
When was the last time
we had a visitor?

42
00:05:24.817 --> 00:05:26.654
He must be lost.

43
00:05:26.654 --> 00:05:28.656
No. I don’t think so.

44
00:05:31.395 --> 00:05:34.563
He must want something.

45
00:05:34.563 --> 00:05:36.697
- W... Oh. my God.

46
00:05:36.697 --> 00:05:37.863
Hey. whoa...

47
00:05:37.863 --> 00:05:39.634
- Um...
- You been messing with this?

48
00:05:39.634 --> 00:05:41.768
What are you talking about?
- It’s empty. Hen.

49
00:05:41.768 --> 00:05:43.440
Yeah. We never leave it loaded.

50
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.277
What do you mean.
we never leave it loaded?

51
00:05:45.277 --> 00:05:46.806
Just put the gun back!
Put it back.

52
00:05:46.806 --> 00:05:48.478
- Or what?

53
00:05:48.478 --> 00:05:50.909
Just put the gun back. OK?
We need to go. Come on.

54
00:05:52.581 --> 00:05:55.716
I can’t do anything
with the gun. It’s empty.

55
00:05:56.651 --> 00:05:58.653
Go.

56
00:06:05.792 --> 00:06:07.563
Hello?

57
00:06:07.563 --> 00:06:11.336
I’m sorry.
I know it’s late.

58
00:06:11.336 --> 00:06:12.832
Is that Henrietta?

59
00:06:15.472 --> 00:06:18.442
Who’s that?
Terrance.

60
00:06:18.442 --> 00:06:21.038
Yeah. we don’t know
any Terrance.

61
00:06:21.038 --> 00:06:24.415
Junior?

62
00:06:24.415 --> 00:06:26.681
I think you’ll want to hear
what I have to say.

63
00:06:26.681 --> 00:06:27.946
Both of you.

64
00:06:27.946 --> 00:06:29.420
No.

65
00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:36.922
What’s this about?

66
00:06:36.922 --> 00:06:39.023
I’m here
on behalf of OuterMore.

67
00:06:39.023 --> 00:06:40.662
OuterMore?

68
00:06:40.662 --> 00:06:43.566
We’re working on
the climate migration strategy.

69
00:06:43.566 --> 00:06:46.503
Specifically.
Off-Earth habitation.

70
00:06:46.503 --> 00:06:48.065
What is he saying?

71
00:06:48.065 --> 00:06:49.869
I think he means
living in space.

72
00:06:51.805 --> 00:06:53.576
You OK if I came in?

73
00:06:56.678 --> 00:06:58.009
Yeah.

74
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.456
Anybody else
in the car?

75
00:07:05.456 --> 00:07:07.953
No.
making these visits is my job.

76
00:07:07.953 --> 00:07:09.361
Hi.

77
00:07:21.131 --> 00:07:24.134
Do you want to sit down?
Sure.

78
00:07:24.134 --> 00:07:25.839
OK.

79
00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:27.478
Mm-hm.

80
00:07:33.814 --> 00:07:35.981
It’s a great place.
Hm.

81
00:07:37.015 --> 00:07:39.490
Charming.

82
00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:40.821
Rustic.

83
00:07:41.888 --> 00:07:43.725
How old is it?

84
00:07:43.725 --> 00:07:47.498
Ah. it’s old.
Couple of hundred years.

85
00:07:47.498 --> 00:07:49.962
Wow.

86
00:07:49.962 --> 00:07:53.702
You just... you just
don’t see this anymore.

87
00:07:53.702 --> 00:07:55.572
Guessing it’s always
been in the family?

88
00:07:55.572 --> 00:07:57.937
Yeah. Yeah. fifth generation.

89
00:07:57.937 --> 00:07:59.840
Oh. I love that.

90
00:08:00.973 --> 00:08:02.843
The old ways of living.

91
00:08:02.843 --> 00:08:05.076
Yep.
still a few of us left. so...

92
00:08:06.418 --> 00:08:08.882
But you don’t farm it. do you?

93
00:08:08.882 --> 00:08:11.115
Right. well. this is...
this is very exciting.

94
00:08:11.115 --> 00:08:13.623
but before I say anything.

95
00:08:13.623 --> 00:08:15.625
I’m supposed to show you this.

96
00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:18.463
Now. I’m sure you’ve seen
our previous campaigns.

97
00:08:18.463 --> 00:08:20.124
but this one is special.

98
00:08:20.124 --> 00:08:22.159
- Can you see OK?

99
00:08:22.159 --> 00:08:23.864
Yep. Can you see?

100
00:08:24.931 --> 00:08:26.130
Uh-huh.

101
00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:27.967
We are all
so proud of you.

102
00:08:27.967 --> 00:08:29.540
It is so inspiring.

103
00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.476
You’re giving us hope
for the planet.

104
00:08:31.476 --> 00:08:33.511
I got chosen.
I’m going to space.

105
00:08:33.511 --> 00:08:35.678
We’re all
eternally grateful.

106
00:08:35.678 --> 00:08:37.581
I can’t wait to see
your smiling face soon.

107
00:08:37.581 --> 00:08:39.715
We’ve been working on
the next phase of transition

108
00:08:39.715 --> 00:08:41.112
for a long time.

109
00:08:41.112 --> 00:08:43.213
Uh. there’s always been
several possibilities

110
00:08:43.213 --> 00:08:45.050
of human existence in space.

111
00:08:46.491 --> 00:08:52.761
we decided to build our own
space station. our own planet.

112
00:08:53.828 --> 00:08:55.896
Go further.

113
00:08:55.896 --> 00:08:57.700
Be better.

114
00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.604
For the planet. For the future.

115
00:09:00.604 --> 00:09:02.573
For all of us.

116
00:09:02.573 --> 00:09:04.806
How will you rise?

117
00:09:04.806 --> 00:09:07.479
Yeah. what... what’s that
got to do with us?

118
00:09:07.479 --> 00:09:10.515
Right. so I’m here
because of the installation.

119
00:09:10.515 --> 00:09:12.913
Ah. the first wave
of temporary resettlement.

120
00:09:12.913 --> 00:09:15.520
Oh. yeah. yeah. no. I think
I heard about this shit once.

121
00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.247
You did?
- Looks pretty ridiculous.

122
00:09:17.247 --> 00:09:19.249
I mean. why would you
spend money up there

123
00:09:19.249 --> 00:09:21.119
when you should
be fixing things here?

124
00:09:21.119 --> 00:09:24.122
Well. see.
our motivation is proactive.

125
00:09:24.122 --> 00:09:26.256
to help
our children’s children.

126
00:09:28.192 --> 00:09:30.700
Do you have kids?

127
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:34.638
Could I trouble you
for a glass of water?

128
00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:41.579
Yeah.

129
00:09:41.579 --> 00:09:43.207
I’ll have a beer. yeah.
- Yeah.

130
00:09:43.207 --> 00:09:45.517
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

131
00:09:49.884 --> 00:09:51.655
It’s hot.

132
00:09:51.655 --> 00:09:53.591
I’m used to air conditioning.

133
00:09:53.591 --> 00:09:54.889
Right.
Yeah.

134
00:09:56.561 --> 00:09:59.861
Do you remember a time when
there were farms around here?

135
00:10:01.632 --> 00:10:06.802
With livestock. and crops.
Real farms. no offense.

136
00:10:08.001 --> 00:10:09.607
Mm-hm.

137
00:10:10.839 --> 00:10:13.743
Yeah. only as a kid. though.

138
00:10:13.743 --> 00:10:15.745
Must have been bought up
or burned.

139
00:10:15.745 --> 00:10:19.243
- Burned?
- Yeah. By the corporations.

140
00:10:19.243 --> 00:10:20.915
They burn all the old farms.

141
00:10:20.915 --> 00:10:22.851
clearing the fields
for their hybrid stuff.

142
00:10:22.851 --> 00:10:24.622
They don’t give a shit.

143
00:10:24.622 --> 00:10:26.987
I noticed all the canola
on the drive on the way in.

144
00:10:26.987 --> 00:10:28.890
I didn’t realize
it grew this time of year.

145
00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:31.563
All year round.
Barely needs water.

146
00:10:31.563 --> 00:10:33.092
Doesn’t seem natural.

147
00:10:33.092 --> 00:10:34.599
It’s not.

148
00:10:36.095 --> 00:10:38.262
Man. you could...

149
00:10:38.262 --> 00:10:41.199
you could do whatever you want
out here.

150
00:10:42.673 --> 00:10:44.675
Here you go.

151
00:10:44.675 --> 00:10:45.940
Thank you.

152
00:10:47.579 --> 00:10:50.109
Oh. yeah. you won’t get
water like that in the city.

153
00:10:50.109 --> 00:10:52.309
- Thanks.
- Yeah. I do love it.

154
00:10:53.948 --> 00:10:55.345
Mmm.

155
00:10:55.345 --> 00:10:56.786
Cheers.

156
00:10:58.084 --> 00:11:02.055
So. I’ve been assigned
to your file.

157
00:11:02.055 --> 00:11:03.760
We have a file?

158
00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.630
You didn’t sign us up
for anything. did you?

159
00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:08.193
No.

160
00:11:08.193 --> 00:11:10.261
OK. so this guy just showed up
out of nowhere. right?

161
00:11:10.261 --> 00:11:11.669
Yeah. it’s not my fault...

162
00:11:11.669 --> 00:11:13.231
Wouldn’t be the first
fucking time...

163
00:11:13.231 --> 00:11:15.640
No. it’s true.
No. you didn’t. you didn’t.

164
00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.071
Um. but we’ve had
our first lottery.

165
00:11:18.071 --> 00:11:24.143
I’m excited to say
that you’ve made the shortlist.

166
00:11:24.143 --> 00:11:28.048
You’re one step closer
to living up there.

167
00:11:28.048 --> 00:11:30.215
OK...

168
00:11:30.215 --> 00:11:33.691
OK. well.
you’re wasting your time

169
00:11:33.691 --> 00:11:36.991
because we... we haven’t
even been on an airplane.

170
00:11:36.991 --> 00:11:38.993
and she’d... she’d hate it.

171
00:11:38.993 --> 00:11:41.325
Oh. so you wouldn’t?
You wouldn’t hate it?

172
00:11:41.325 --> 00:11:43.833
I...I’m just saying
you wouldn’t like flying.

173
00:11:43.833 --> 00:11:45.835
You’ve also never been
on an airplane.

174
00:11:45.835 --> 00:11:48.233
OK. we both don’t fucking like
flying. What’s the big deal?

175
00:11:48.233 --> 00:11:51.236
Alright. I should... I should
clarify. sorry. Um...

176
00:11:51.236 --> 00:11:54.206
I’m talking about you here.
Junior. Only you.

177
00:11:54.206 --> 00:11:55.878
What...?

178
00:11:55.878 --> 00:11:58.683
These tests require
real physical strength.

179
00:11:58.683 --> 00:12:01.246
specific skills.
all of which you have. Junior.

180
00:12:01.246 --> 00:12:04.249
Wait. wait. wait. you’re not
fucking around. right?

181
00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.021
No. this is just a warning.

182
00:12:09.727 --> 00:12:11.993
Sorry.

183
00:12:11.993 --> 00:12:13.863
Sorry. warning’s
the wrong word.

184
00:12:13.863 --> 00:12:15.733
This is... this is good news.

185
00:12:15.733 --> 00:12:17.295
It’s good news?

186
00:12:17.295 --> 00:12:20.969
And the... the government
knows about this. right?

187
00:12:20.969 --> 00:12:22.399
We are the government.

188
00:12:22.399 --> 00:12:26.172
Our space station
is orbiting Earth as we speak.

189
00:12:26.172 --> 00:12:28.339
And what if... what if
I just say no. right?

190
00:12:28.339 --> 00:12:30.110
If I just refuse.

191
00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:31.749
What happens then?

192
00:12:33.245 --> 00:12:36.050
You do know about conscription?

193
00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:37.348
During the old wars.

194
00:12:37.348 --> 00:12:39.383
if-if you were picked.
you had to go to war.

195
00:12:39.383 --> 00:12:41.759
And if you didn’t. well...

196
00:12:43.992 --> 00:12:45.158
Yeah.

197
00:12:49.096 --> 00:12:50.867
Are you threatening us?

198
00:12:51.835 --> 00:12:53.397
- Junior.
- Is that what’s happening?

199
00:12:53.397 --> 00:12:54.838
Junior.
- No. no.

200
00:12:54.838 --> 00:12:56.268
Are... are you
threatening us?

201
00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:59.139
We could lose the farm.

202
00:13:01.471 --> 00:13:05.145
Let’s not focus
on the rule of law here. OK?

203
00:13:05.145 --> 00:13:07.752
This operation
could end up being

204
00:13:07.752 --> 00:13:11.888
the biggest public initiative
ever. OK?

205
00:13:11.888 --> 00:13:14.319
You’d be a hero. Junior.

206
00:13:14.319 --> 00:13:16.420
Do you want to live
mundane lives

207
00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.730
like everyone else.

208
00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:22.030
or do you want to be part of
something special and unique?

209
00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:25.165
Because that’s what
this is really about.

210
00:13:25.165 --> 00:13:27.365
A chance to be
a better version of yourself.

211
00:13:27.365 --> 00:13:29.169
Sounds pretty good.

212
00:13:29.169 --> 00:13:31.303
Listen.
it’s time to move on.

213
00:13:31.303 --> 00:13:34.372
Soon. most of us
won’t be able to live here.

214
00:13:34.372 --> 00:13:36.979
Our planet was marvelous -
is marvelous -

215
00:13:36.979 --> 00:13:39.245
but it’s given us all it can.

216
00:13:39.245 --> 00:13:42.149
No. it didn’t give us anything.
We stole it.

217
00:13:42.149 --> 00:13:44.921
How long’s
the shortlist?

218
00:13:44.921 --> 00:13:46.384
I can’t reveal that.
- Wait...

219
00:13:46.384 --> 00:13:48.793
But what I can tell you is
that nothing will be decided

220
00:13:48.793 --> 00:13:49.959
for a couple of years.

221
00:13:49.959 --> 00:13:51.323
A couple of years?

222
00:13:51.323 --> 00:13:53.160
Yeah. sadly.
these tests

223
00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.799
will run
in two-year cycles.

224
00:13:54.799 --> 00:13:57.032
Right. so you expect us
to just go on living

225
00:13:57.032 --> 00:13:59.133
like everything’s normal?

226
00:14:00.266 --> 00:14:03.170
Yes. Because it is.

227
00:14:04.237 --> 00:14:06.008
Nothing’s been decided yet.

228
00:14:07.141 --> 00:14:08.373
Mm-hm.

229
00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.160
You look after that
wee Henrietta for me.

230
00:14:27.832 --> 00:14:29.900
These kinds of things
can be upsetting.

231
00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.000
Yeah.

232
00:15:24.988 --> 00:15:26.187
Really?

233
00:15:27.859 --> 00:15:31.962
Are you just gonna
go to sleep after that. huh?

234
00:15:31.962 --> 00:15:33.964
Sorry.

235
00:15:33.964 --> 00:15:36.967
Can we talk tomorrow?
I’m not feeling well.

236
00:15:38.331 --> 00:15:41.400
No. we should
talk about this now.

237
00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:45.338
Do you think you could sleep
in the guest room tonight?

238
00:15:45.338 --> 00:15:47.637
I just don’t want you
to catch anything.

239
00:15:54.952 --> 00:15:57.152
Since when has that mattered. huh?

240
00:15:59.616 --> 00:16:01.552
I’d rather be alone.

241
00:16:04.126 --> 00:16:06.623
You’re serious. You want me
to sleep in the guest room?

242
00:16:06.623 --> 00:16:07.932
Please.

243
00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:18.602
- How did you know?

244
00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:21.407
How did I know what?

245
00:16:22.342 --> 00:16:26.181
Before he got... Hen.

246
00:16:26.181 --> 00:16:28.953
Before he got out. you said.
"He must want something."

247
00:16:28.953 --> 00:16:30.482
How did you know it was a man?

248
00:16:30.482 --> 00:16:32.187
I don’t know.
is that what I said?

249
00:16:32.187 --> 00:16:34.585
Yeah. when the car pulled up.
Oh. I don’t know.

250
00:16:34.585 --> 00:16:36.191
It wasn’t intentional.

251
00:16:36.191 --> 00:16:38.424
I mean. if I said it. it was
probably without thinking.

252
00:16:38.424 --> 00:16:39.656
Listen. I’m exhausted.

253
00:16:39.656 --> 00:16:41.658
and if it’s OK.
I just want to go to sleep...

254
00:16:41.658 --> 00:16:43.594
When you said it.
it was so certain. so...

255
00:16:43.594 --> 00:16:45.134
OK. well. name one woman

256
00:16:45.134 --> 00:16:47.103
that would drive up here
at night. alone. hmm?

257
00:16:47.103 --> 00:16:48.632
The way he was
looking at you...

258
00:16:48.632 --> 00:16:50.271
Why are you pushing me?

259
00:17:02.547 --> 00:17:03.713
OK.

260
00:17:13.657 --> 00:17:15.494
Could you shut the door?

261
00:17:17.661 --> 00:17:19.168
Sure.

262
00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:36.746
Wow.

263
00:17:38.055 --> 00:17:39.386
Wow.

264
00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:43.126
Oh...

265
00:17:43.126 --> 00:17:44.655
Just beautiful!

266
00:17:46.393 --> 00:17:47.658
Fuck me.

267
00:17:55.204 --> 00:17:56.337
Fuck.

268
00:18:04.147 --> 00:18:06.314

You know
we won’t see him again.

283
00:21:10.927 --> 00:21:13.666
They’re not actually interested
in someone like me.

284
00:21:13.666 --> 00:21:15.800
What have I got to offer?

285
00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:16.933
Hm.

286
00:21:18.209 --> 00:21:20.739
You might be surprised.

287
00:21:23.511 --> 00:21:25.909
Do me a favor?
What?

288
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:27.812
Stop wearing that shirt.

289
00:21:30.518 --> 00:21:33.917
Why? I like this shirt.

290
00:21:35.424 --> 00:21:37.690
You were wearing it
the day we met.

291
00:21:39.956 --> 00:21:42.794
And the more you wear it.
the more worn out it’ll get.

292
00:21:46.699 --> 00:21:47.799
Hm.

293
00:21:49.438 --> 00:21:52.507
So. what else do you remember
about that day?

294
00:21:54.476 --> 00:21:56.346
We were happy.

295
00:23:09.716 --> 00:23:11.355
I miss you.

296
00:24:15.452 --> 00:24:17.652
Do you still
like living here?

297
00:24:18.719 --> 00:24:19.819
Why?

298
00:24:21.887 --> 00:24:24.428
Do you feel happy here?

299
00:24:25.528 --> 00:24:27.662
Of course I’m happy here.

300
00:24:27.662 --> 00:24:29.092
Aren’t you?

301
00:24:31.468 --> 00:24:33.470
What am I to you?

302
00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.969
Oh. you know. if this is
about me leaving.

303
00:24:37.969 --> 00:24:39.674
if you’re worried about that...

304
00:24:39.674 --> 00:24:41.676
No it’s not. it’s not.
It’s about us.

305
00:24:41.676 --> 00:24:43.447
Us?
- Yeah.

306
00:24:46.978 --> 00:24:50.014
Did you have any questions
when we got married?

307
00:24:50.014 --> 00:24:52.555
There shouldn’t be questions.

308
00:24:52.555 --> 00:24:53.985
We all have questions.

309
00:24:53.985 --> 00:24:55.888
Well. not when
you take your vows.

310
00:24:57.659 --> 00:25:01.190
So in seven years.
you’ve never felt any doubt?

311
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:03.830
Never.

312
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:06.833
Getting married straight out
of school doesn’t worry you.

313
00:25:06.833 --> 00:25:09.737
- when you’re still a teenager?
- We weren’t school friends.

314
00:25:09.737 --> 00:25:11.442
And we’re different.

315
00:25:12.806 --> 00:25:14.874
We met at the right time.

316
00:25:16.106 --> 00:25:17.844
Sorry I’ve been distant.

317
00:25:17.844 --> 00:25:19.549
It’s OK.

318
00:25:24.917 --> 00:25:27.623
What do you think about more.
the past or the future?

319
00:25:27.623 --> 00:25:29.152
What?

320
00:25:29.152 --> 00:25:32.089
Jesus. what is this?
- Sorry.

321
00:25:32.089 --> 00:25:33.596
Oh...

322
00:25:33.596 --> 00:25:35.664
I don’t mean to pepper you
with questions like this

323
00:25:35.664 --> 00:25:38.227
first thing in the morning.
but I really want to know.

324
00:25:38.227 --> 00:25:39.668
OK.

325
00:25:41.967 --> 00:25:44.640
Uh. I think...

326
00:25:45.806 --> 00:25:47.511
...we need a bigger bed.

327
00:25:50.745 --> 00:25:53.616
I was asking you
a serious question.

328
00:25:53.616 --> 00:25:54.782
I know.

329
00:25:55.783 --> 00:25:57.488
You’re not taking me seriously.

330
00:25:57.488 --> 00:25:59.721
- I’m sorry.
- No. you’re not.

331
00:25:59.721 --> 00:26:00.920
No. I’m not.

332
00:26:01.921 --> 00:26:03.758
OK. I’m sorry. babe.

333
00:26:04.858 --> 00:26:06.794
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah.

334
00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:41.664
Coo-ee!

335
00:26:47.769 --> 00:26:49.133
Coo-ee!

336
00:28:31.708 --> 00:28:34.304
To get the best understanding
of life up there.

337
00:28:34.304 --> 00:28:36.680
the selected group
needs to be random.

338
00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:37.912
All walks of life.

339
00:28:37.912 --> 00:28:39.375
OK. so pick someone else. Terrance.

340
00:28:39.375 --> 00:28:41.113
People like us
don’t belong in space.

341
00:28:41.113 --> 00:28:42.653
But that’s the whole point.

342
00:28:42.653 --> 00:28:45.854
At some stage. all of us
may need to go. Permanently.

343
00:28:47.284 --> 00:28:50.122
You’ll receive
handsome compensation.

344
00:28:50.122 --> 00:28:52.223
A thank-you from the government.

345
00:28:53.994 --> 00:28:56.733
Look. you’ve been gifted
a rare opportunity

346
00:28:56.733 --> 00:28:58.394
that for now seems daunting.

347
00:28:58.394 --> 00:29:01.672
But why does the unknown
have to be a burden?

348
00:29:01.672 --> 00:29:04.972
Junior. this is
incredibly rare. OK?

349
00:29:04.972 --> 00:29:07.403
And you’ve been selected.

350
00:29:07.403 --> 00:29:09.207
You’re going to
the installation.

351
00:29:09.207 --> 00:29:11.913
No. no. listen to me. I don’t
like how you just show up here.

352
00:29:11.913 --> 00:29:13.882
and you say all this shit
and you act

353
00:29:13.882 --> 00:29:16.115
like we should be thanking you.

354
00:29:16.115 --> 00:29:18.953
And if it’s such... if it’s such
a fucking great opportunity.

355
00:29:18.953 --> 00:29:22.121
why is it only you
that shows up here?

356
00:29:22.121 --> 00:29:25.157
Where the fuck
is everyone else. Terrance?

357
00:29:25.157 --> 00:29:27.060
Would it help
if there were more people

358
00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:28.864
scurrying around your house
and property?

359
00:29:30.426 --> 00:29:32.164
What’s in your bags?

360
00:29:32.164 --> 00:29:34.430
I thought
I’d drop some things off.

361
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:38.071
I’ll have to stay.
now that it’s official.

362
00:29:38.071 --> 00:29:40.007
Here? You’re staying here?

363
00:29:40.007 --> 00:29:41.844
If you recall
from my last visit. Hen...

364
00:29:41.844 --> 00:29:44.044
I thought we still
had longer together. Terrance.

365
00:29:44.044 --> 00:29:46.178
...it was all
explained in the paperwork.

366
00:29:46.178 --> 00:29:47.916
I assume there’s a guest room?

367
00:29:47.916 --> 00:29:49.819
This is bullshit.
- Why?

368
00:29:49.819 --> 00:29:51.986
There are
a series of steps to complete.

369
00:29:51.986 --> 00:29:53.889
Observations.
data to collect...

370
00:29:53.889 --> 00:29:55.825
When does he leave?

371
00:29:55.825 --> 00:29:57.827
Couple of weeks.

372
00:29:58.993 --> 00:30:00.357
Why?

373
00:30:00.357 --> 00:30:03.426
This next stage
is going to go fast.

374
00:30:03.426 --> 00:30:06.363
Look. I’ll stay nearby for now.

375
00:30:06.363 --> 00:30:08.365
Give you guys
a little more alone time.

376
00:30:08.365 --> 00:30:09.971
Come here. come here.

377
00:30:09.971 --> 00:30:11.742
Shh. Shh. shh.

378
00:30:11.742 --> 00:30:13.469
It’s OK. baby.
It’s OK. Shh.

379
00:30:13.469 --> 00:30:14.844
Shh. shh.

380
00:30:48.207 --> 00:30:50.341
♪ Why does the sun... ♪

381
00:30:50.341 --> 00:30:51.540
Come on.

382
00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:55.049
♪ Go on shining?

383
00:30:55.049 --> 00:31:02.122
♪ Why does the sea
rush to shore?

384
00:31:02.122 --> 00:31:04.861
♪ Don’t they know... ♪

385
00:31:04.861 --> 00:31:08.359
♪ It’s the end of the world?

386
00:31:08.359 --> 00:31:12.066
♪ Cos you don’t love me
anymore... ♪

387
00:31:12.066 --> 00:31:14.002
Hey. hey. hey. hey!

388
00:31:15.201 --> 00:31:16.532
Hey. these are mine!

389
00:31:16.532 --> 00:31:19.271
Yeah. well. you never wear ’em.
and they stink.

390
00:31:19.271 --> 00:31:22.142
Well. I hate breaking in
new gloves. so...

391
00:31:22.142 --> 00:31:24.111
This is why
we have so much stuff.

392
00:31:24.111 --> 00:31:26.113
because you can’t let go.
Of anything.

393
00:31:26.113 --> 00:31:27.884
What do...
what do you mean by that?

394
00:31:27.884 --> 00:31:29.919
It means that all of this
is just shit.

395
00:31:29.919 --> 00:31:31.580
It’s stuff from your past.
not ours.

396
00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:34.022
OK. and if you start
throwing things out randomly...

397
00:31:34.022 --> 00:31:35.287
Stop it. OK?

398
00:31:37.058 --> 00:31:39.027
I...I need this stuff.

399
00:31:40.523 --> 00:31:43.295
Your face is flushed.
- Well...

400
00:31:43.295 --> 00:31:45.066
I... Hen. I just...

401
00:31:45.066 --> 00:31:47.596
Listen. I just wish that
you wouldn’t get like this.

402
00:31:47.596 --> 00:31:49.070
especially tonight.

403
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:50.940
Why? What’s so special
about tonight?

404
00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:52.843
Because it’s our last chance
to be alone.

405
00:31:52.843 --> 00:31:56.143
Oh. God. yeah. and I guess you
just wanted a quiet night in?

406
00:31:56.143 --> 00:31:58.376
- Just like the old days? Yeah?
- OK.

407
00:31:58.376 --> 00:32:01.181
we haven’t even talked about
me leaving and you’re acting

408
00:32:01.181 --> 00:32:03.612
like this is no big deal.
like it’s not even happening.

409
00:32:03.612 --> 00:32:05.581
- Give me that!
- Fucking talk to me!

410
00:32:05.581 --> 00:32:09.123
This is happening faster
than I was expecting it to.

411
00:32:09.123 --> 00:32:10.993
And now he’s coming to stay.

412
00:32:10.993 --> 00:32:13.226
OK. well... so why are you
cleaning the fucking house?

413
00:32:13.226 --> 00:32:16.064
Just give me the...! I don’t
want you stressing over him.

414
00:32:16.064 --> 00:32:18.066
- I’m not stressing.
- OK. then. what is it?

415
00:32:18.066 --> 00:32:21.135
What is it? Look at me.
Look at me.

416
00:32:21.135 --> 00:32:23.170
I’m really worried about you.
OK?

417
00:32:24.974 --> 00:32:26.173
Hey.

418
00:32:27.911 --> 00:32:33.609
Hen? I’m going away for years.
OK? It’s not days.

419
00:32:33.609 --> 00:32:35.644
I’m worried
about leaving you here alone.

420
00:32:35.644 --> 00:32:37.954
You don’t have to
worry about that. Junior.

421
00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:42.453
Fuck!
What?

422
00:32:45.093 --> 00:32:46.930
That. In there.

423
00:32:54.069 --> 00:32:57.435
Oh.
I’ve never seen one like it.

424
00:32:57.435 --> 00:33:00.273
They’re getting bigger. God.
I hope it’s not an infestation.

425
00:33:00.273 --> 00:33:02.638
They’ll get into the walls.
Christ. that’s all I need.

426
00:33:02.638 --> 00:33:05.311
It’s only one.

427
00:33:05.311 --> 00:33:07.379
Well. one is too many.
- Mm.

428
00:33:09.612 --> 00:33:12.153
I’m checking our room for more.

429
00:33:15.255 --> 00:33:16.487
Hey.

430
00:33:18.291 --> 00:33:19.996
Hey. little guy.

431
00:33:21.129 --> 00:33:22.691
Junior.

432
00:33:22.691 --> 00:33:24.528
What is it?
You’re staring.

433
00:33:24.528 --> 00:33:27.069
Don’t... Ah...
It’s OK. I’ll take care of it.

434
00:33:28.037 --> 00:33:29.467
Hmm?

435
00:33:36.243 --> 00:33:38.212
Why aren’t you moving?

436
00:34:28.658 --> 00:34:30.132
Here you go.

437
00:34:33.333 --> 00:34:36.270
What are you doing here?
What’s wrong?

438
00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:38.602
I. uh...

439
00:34:38.602 --> 00:34:41.539
I started thinking
about leaving.

440
00:34:41.539 --> 00:34:44.575
The things I’ll miss.
things that aren’t obvious.

441
00:34:44.575 --> 00:34:46.478
Maybe we should talk
about this outside...

442
00:34:46.478 --> 00:34:51.681
No. no. no. just like
stupid little things like...

443
00:34:51.681 --> 00:34:54.552
Like how by the sound
of the floor creaking.

444
00:34:54.552 --> 00:34:56.554
I know that
it’s your steps upstairs.

445
00:34:58.061 --> 00:35:01.328
And nobody
could ever recognize that.

446
00:35:01.328 --> 00:35:03.297
It feels like
a secret between us.

447
00:35:03.297 --> 00:35:04.430
It’s...

448
00:35:06.069 --> 00:35:08.599
I’ll miss hearing those steps.

449
00:35:08.599 --> 00:35:11.074
Hey. Junior.
- What?

450
00:35:11.074 --> 00:35:13.340
Can we just
talk about this tonight?

451
00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:16.244
- You know we need this job.
- No. let’s just be together.

452
00:35:17.278 --> 00:35:18.708
Like right now.

453
00:35:20.314 --> 00:35:21.678
- Hmm?

454
00:35:21.678 --> 00:35:23.581
None of this matters.

455
00:36:30.879 --> 00:36:34.157
Strange. how dying
can still be beautiful. Hm.

456
00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:36.885
Are you afraid
of dying?

457
00:36:39.756 --> 00:36:42.165
Maybe of not being ready.

458
00:37:07.553 --> 00:37:12.195
Have you ever thought.
what if we’re not actually...

459
00:37:12.195 --> 00:37:15.231
looking up at the sky?

460
00:37:16.529 --> 00:37:19.202
What if we’re actually
looking down?

461
00:37:21.204 --> 00:37:23.371
The sky below us.

462
00:37:24.471 --> 00:37:26.836
Try. Think about it.

463
00:37:39.816 --> 00:37:42.225
Oh.

464
00:37:44.227 --> 00:37:46.559
- See?
- Oh. yeah.

465
00:37:49.727 --> 00:37:51.465
Give me my pants!

466
00:37:51.465 --> 00:37:52.631
Whoo-oo!

467
00:37:52.631 --> 00:37:54.930
Hen. I’m serious.

468
00:37:58.505 --> 00:38:00.441
Wha-hey!

469
00:38:09.582 --> 00:38:11.815
Why don’t we just disappear?

470
00:38:11.815 --> 00:38:13.520
Get out of here?

471
00:38:25.928 --> 00:38:27.369
Oh.

472
00:38:35.971 --> 00:38:38.941
Hello. Hi.

473
00:38:39.909 --> 00:38:41.614
Look at you.

474
00:38:42.648 --> 00:38:44.287
I’m not gonna hurt you.

475
00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:46.256
Come here.

476
00:38:48.984 --> 00:38:52.922
It’s OK. Good boy.

477
00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:56.497
What happened to you. hey?

478
00:38:58.268 --> 00:39:00.270
Where did you come from?

479
00:39:02.899 --> 00:39:04.637
It’s OK.

480
00:39:04.637 --> 00:39:07.508
There you go. See? Good boy.

481
00:39:09.004 --> 00:39:10.478
Junior?

482
00:39:11.578 --> 00:39:12.777
Junior!

483
00:39:14.614 --> 00:39:16.748
Oh. shit. Junior!

484
00:39:18.882 --> 00:39:21.291
Junior! Fuck.

485
00:39:21.291 --> 00:39:22.622
Junior!

486
00:39:24.987 --> 00:39:26.593
Stop!

487
00:39:27.792 --> 00:39:29.497
Where are you going?

488
00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:38.440
Junior!

489
00:40:21.483 --> 00:40:23.012
No! Fuck off! No!

490
00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:25.619
Junior!

491
00:40:25.619 --> 00:40:27.588
Don’t hurt him.
It’s not his fault!

492
00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:53.383
Hey...
- Are you OK?

493
00:40:53.383 --> 00:40:56.386
Hey. Hey. hey. hey. Hey.

494
00:40:57.783 --> 00:41:00.049
Did they hurt you?

495
00:41:00.049 --> 00:41:02.788
- Who?
- Are you hurt?

496
00:41:02.788 --> 00:41:05.725
- I’m OK.
- There were men and...

497
00:41:05.725 --> 00:41:07.859
- No. no. no. no.
- You... you were screaming.

498
00:41:07.859 --> 00:41:09.795
No. they were just
burning an old barn.

499
00:41:09.795 --> 00:41:12.468
You’re confused.
You hurt yourself.

500
00:41:12.468 --> 00:41:14.569
But you’re gonna be OK.

501
00:41:14.569 --> 00:41:16.406
You’re lucky.
- No. we...

502
00:41:16.406 --> 00:41:18.639
We need to tell someone
about what’s happening.

503
00:41:18.639 --> 00:41:20.410
Tell them what? Tell them what?

504
00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:22.445
You had an accident.
that’s all.

505
00:41:22.445 --> 00:41:24.942
No. no. no.
we’re in danger. baby. OK?

506
00:41:24.942 --> 00:41:27.846
Junior. Junior.

507
00:41:27.846 --> 00:41:30.915
You’re the one
that ran into the fire.

508
00:41:32.785 --> 00:41:36.052
Why would you do that. hmm?

509
00:41:36.052 --> 00:41:39.726
What do you mean?
- What... what was in the fire?

510
00:41:39.726 --> 00:41:42.498
I hope this wasn’t done intentionally.

511
00:41:42.498 --> 00:41:45.094
You. uh... you think
I did this on purpose?

512
00:41:45.094 --> 00:41:48.163
Well. an injury won’t change
anything. You know that. right?

513
00:41:48.163 --> 00:41:50.473
I can’t feel
this side of my body.

514
00:41:50.473 --> 00:41:51.903
That’s the anesthetic.

515
00:41:51.903 --> 00:41:54.004
It’ll wear off soon.
But you won’t be able

516
00:41:54.004 --> 00:41:55.907
to use that arm much
for a while. though.

517
00:41:55.907 --> 00:41:58.107
and you have to get used
to that recliner of yours.

518
00:41:58.107 --> 00:41:59.515
Why?

519
00:41:59.515 --> 00:42:01.044
Well. you can’t sleep
lying down.

520
00:42:01.044 --> 00:42:03.112
You can recline to
about 45 degrees but that’s it.

521
00:42:03.112 --> 00:42:05.015
What do you mean.
I can’t sleep lying down?

522
00:42:05.015 --> 00:42:06.819
The doctor did
a minor procedure and...

523
00:42:06.819 --> 00:42:08.216
A procedure? What doctor?

524
00:42:08.216 --> 00:42:10.526
She operated on your
injured shoulder. the tendon.

525
00:42:10.526 --> 00:42:12.726
It went very well. but she’d
like to leave it covered.

526
00:42:17.126 --> 00:42:19.931
Ah. here. You gotta take these.

527
00:42:35.716 --> 00:42:37.652
Jacqueline du Pre.

528
00:42:41.084 --> 00:42:46.496
"A musician of nature
with an unerring instinct."

529
00:42:47.959 --> 00:42:49.928
That’s how her husband
described her.

530
00:42:55.736 --> 00:43:00.543
I know this hasn’t been easy
on either of you.

531
00:43:00.543 --> 00:43:03.546
But soon.
all of this will be behind us.

532
00:43:03.546 --> 00:43:07.946
So I would like to congratulate
you on making it this far.

533
00:43:09.585 --> 00:43:12.687
South of France.
The real thing.

534
00:43:12.687 --> 00:43:16.218
Why are you following me?

535
00:43:16.218 --> 00:43:19.529
I’m keeping you safe.
both of you. It’s crucial.

536
00:43:19.529 --> 00:43:21.960
Both of us? What...?

537
00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:23.764
We’re taking Junior away.

538
00:43:23.764 --> 00:43:25.931
You’ve never been all alone
out here before.

539
00:43:25.931 --> 00:43:29.000
Yeah. so?

540
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.904
Could be a real strain on her.
On your marriage.

541
00:43:31.904 --> 00:43:34.104
You’re the one
that’s forcing me to leave her.

542
00:43:34.104 --> 00:43:36.612
Well. so we have to do
what’s moral.

543
00:43:36.612 --> 00:43:39.043
And what do you consider
to be moral?

544
00:43:40.847 --> 00:43:42.783
We’re going to replace you.

545
00:43:42.783 --> 00:43:45.115
What. me?

546
00:43:45.115 --> 00:43:47.953
We’re going to ensure Hen
has company while you’re away.

547
00:43:47.953 --> 00:43:50.758
No. fuck off. There’s no
fucking way that’s happening.

548
00:43:52.089 --> 00:43:54.861
What. do you really want
to leave her here all alone?

549
00:43:54.861 --> 00:43:56.566
Day after day?
Night after night?

550
00:43:56.566 --> 00:43:58.029
She can handle herself. Terrance.

551
00:43:58.029 --> 00:44:00.603
Sorry. why doesn’t anybody
ask me how I feel about it?

552
00:44:00.603 --> 00:44:02.264
Cos I’m right fucking here.
- Calm down.

553
00:44:02.264 --> 00:44:04.673
No. no. no.
you fucking calm down.

554
00:44:04.673 --> 00:44:07.071
Hear me out. OK?

555
00:44:07.071 --> 00:44:09.942
It’s not another man.

556
00:44:09.942 --> 00:44:12.109
We’re developing
a biological replacement.

557
00:44:12.109 --> 00:44:13.649
Oh. my God.

558
00:44:13.649 --> 00:44:15.310
What the fuck
is he talking about?

559
00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:17.752
In the old days.
you would have left Hen with

560
00:44:17.752 --> 00:44:19.952
a two-dimensional photo
of yourself.

561
00:44:19.952 --> 00:44:21.954
This is the next step. OK?

562
00:44:21.954 --> 00:44:25.727
A dynamic copy of you.
with living tissue.

563
00:44:25.727 --> 00:44:28.257
- volume and a body.
- I don’t want a fucking robot

564
00:44:28.257 --> 00:44:29.995
living with my wife.

565
00:44:29.995 --> 00:44:32.635
Ah. it’s not a robot. OK?

566
00:44:32.635 --> 00:44:35.605
It’s a new kind
of self-determining life form.

567
00:44:35.605 --> 00:44:40.203
The first to live in a domestic
setting as freely as you do.

568
00:44:40.203 --> 00:44:42.304
You’ll see.

569
00:44:42.304 --> 00:44:44.680
It’s going to be astonishing.

570
00:44:45.813 --> 00:44:47.716
There’s a series
of interviews. OK?

571
00:44:47.716 --> 00:44:49.212
No detail is inconsequential.

572
00:44:49.212 --> 00:44:52.281
Only to observe you
and record your daily routine.

573
00:44:52.281 --> 00:44:55.823
That’s why you’re staying.
- This is fucking insane.

574
00:44:55.823 --> 00:44:59.057
For example. what did you
have for breakfast. my man?

575
00:44:59.057 --> 00:45:02.698
OK.
Look.

576
00:45:02.698 --> 00:45:06.196
OuterMore has a duty of care
to those left behind.

577
00:45:07.967 --> 00:45:11.872
You know what my dad
used to get us to do?

578
00:45:11.872 --> 00:45:14.303
What’s that?
- Test of manhood.

579
00:45:14.303 --> 00:45:17.207
- Don’t be an idiot.
- We’d go outside. stand apart

580
00:45:17.207 --> 00:45:19.209
and we each got one punch
at the other.

581
00:45:21.310 --> 00:45:22.982
Oh. you’d punch each other?

582
00:45:22.982 --> 00:45:25.116
- Yeah. you ever punch someone?

583
00:45:25.116 --> 00:45:27.316
Mm. can’t say I have.
- Mm.

584
00:45:27.316 --> 00:45:29.758
I guess that’s what being
a man is. though. right?

585
00:45:29.758 --> 00:45:31.727
Hen. I am just having
a conversation.

586
00:45:31.727 --> 00:45:33.696
So would you do
your test of manhood with me?

587
00:45:33.696 --> 00:45:35.192
Now you’re just being dumb.

588
00:45:45.037 --> 00:45:46.302
Fuck.

589
00:46:10.161 --> 00:46:12.064
As air quality continues

590
00:46:12.064 --> 00:46:13.329
to decline worldwide.

591
00:46:13.329 --> 00:46:15.100
an estimated 1 billion children

592
00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:17.806
remain at risk of developing
respiratory disease.

593
00:46:17.806 --> 00:46:21.073
According to the UN.
820 million children

594
00:46:21.073 --> 00:46:23.339
have experienced
prolonged mega-droughts

595
00:46:23.339 --> 00:46:26.177
and have never seen rain
in their lifetimes.

596
00:46:26.177 --> 00:46:28.443
We now go live
to the Earth Concert stage.

597
00:46:28.443 --> 00:46:30.214
Buzz has been building all day

598
00:46:30.214 --> 00:46:33.756
for this historic performance
of music icons.

599
00:46:33.756 --> 00:46:35.725
Sarita. can you hear me?

600
00:46:35.725 --> 00:46:38.893
Jay. the
energy down here is electric!

601
00:46:38.893 --> 00:46:40.730
An unbelievable line-up.

602
00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:43.733
the likes of which hasn’t been
seen since the Live Aid show

603
00:46:43.733 --> 00:46:45.229
back in the 20th century.

604
00:46:45.229 --> 00:46:47.935
Once again standing up
for what they insist

605
00:46:47.935 --> 00:46:50.938
is the greatest emergency
of this generation.

606
00:46:50.938 --> 00:46:54.040
There is no more time left
for talk and debate

607
00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:58.044
but to offset the centuries
of exploitation and neglect.

608
00:46:58.044 --> 00:47:00.079
The crowds here are huge and...

609
00:47:00.079 --> 00:47:02.312
♪ Yeah
I have dreamed the dream

610
00:47:02.312 --> 00:47:04.116
♪ I have dreamed the dream

611
00:47:04.116 --> 00:47:07.119
♪ Of every common man
♪ Of a common man

612
00:47:07.119 --> 00:47:09.187
♪ Hoping to rise

613
00:47:09.187 --> 00:47:11.288
♪ Hoping to rise... ♪

614
00:47:13.829 --> 00:47:15.358
♪ I have sworn by my blood... ♪

615
00:47:15.358 --> 00:47:18.999
Terrance. I don’t care
what you’re planning. OK?

616
00:47:18.999 --> 00:47:21.199
But whatever you bring here.
it won’t be me.

617
00:47:21.199 --> 00:47:24.235
you know.
cos I can’t be replaced.

618
00:47:24.235 --> 00:47:26.875
Nothing wrong
with a growing self-confidence.

619
00:47:26.875 --> 00:47:30.208
Just make sure for your own
sake it never hurts Hen.

620
00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:36.951
Have you ever hurt her?

621
00:47:41.384 --> 00:47:42.517
Fuck!

622
00:47:47.522 --> 00:47:49.524
No hands!

623
00:47:51.130 --> 00:47:54.232
Whoo! Whoo!

624
00:47:57.169 --> 00:47:59.072
Whoo!

625
00:48:15.022 --> 00:48:18.157
Any hook. any chicken.
it doesn’t matter.

626
00:48:18.157 --> 00:48:19.587
I’m glad the pills

627
00:48:19.587 --> 00:48:21.259
are working on your shoulder.

628
00:48:21.259 --> 00:48:23.063
I do feel energized.

629
00:48:23.063 --> 00:48:24.559
Because
in the coming days

630
00:48:24.559 --> 00:48:26.264
you will be under
enormous physical

631
00:48:26.264 --> 00:48:27.903
and psychological pressure.

632
00:48:30.235 --> 00:48:32.908
OK. You ready?

633
00:48:32.908 --> 00:48:34.074
Alright.

634
00:48:43.083 --> 00:48:45.151
You have to
get used to these tests.

635
00:48:45.151 --> 00:48:48.154
There are more when you arrive.
some less pleasant than others.

636
00:48:51.091 --> 00:48:52.521
Oh. fuck.

637
00:48:52.521 --> 00:48:56.899
Deep tendon carpal-tunnel
reflex test.

638
00:48:56.899 --> 00:48:58.868
I’m so sorry. It’s done.

639
00:49:05.369 --> 00:49:08.042
- Done at work already?
- Why is he facing the wall?

640
00:49:08.042 --> 00:49:09.571
Hen.
you can’t be here.

641
00:49:10.979 --> 00:49:12.574
I think he’s had enough.

642
00:49:12.574 --> 00:49:14.642
You OK?
Uh-huh.

643
00:49:14.642 --> 00:49:16.215
We agreed.

644
00:49:20.923 --> 00:49:22.353
Be downstairs.
- Yep.

645
00:49:29.228 --> 00:49:31.032
What the fuck
was that?

646
00:49:35.267 --> 00:49:38.402
Yeah. we really need
to make sure she’s OK.

647
00:49:40.239 --> 00:49:42.109
If you notice anything unusual.

648
00:49:42.109 --> 00:49:46.377
or if she’s acting odd.
it’s best you tell me.

649
00:49:46.377 --> 00:49:48.115
OK.
If we’re to help her

650
00:49:48.115 --> 00:49:49.919
while you’re away.

651
00:49:49.919 --> 00:49:53.186
your replacement will
need to know what you know.

652
00:49:53.186 --> 00:49:56.420
I need to have an intimate
understanding of your marriage.

653
00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:58.026
the good and the bad.

654
00:49:59.621 --> 00:50:01.425
And anything
you tell me up here.

655
00:50:01.425 --> 00:50:03.394
I promise it’s confidential.

656
00:50:03.394 --> 00:50:05.330
It’s between you and me.

657
00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:09.268
You can handle that. right?

658
00:50:09.268 --> 00:50:10.500
Mm-hm.

659
00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:15.307
This is more
than saving the farm. Junior.

660
00:50:15.307 --> 00:50:17.507
It’s about ensuring
your marriage survives

661
00:50:17.507 --> 00:50:19.146
while you’re gone.

662
00:50:31.587 --> 00:50:33.523
Have you ever
cheated on her?

663
00:50:33.523 --> 00:50:34.689
What?

664
00:50:36.328 --> 00:50:37.494
Hen.

665
00:50:38.462 --> 00:50:41.399
No. definitely not.

666
00:50:41.399 --> 00:50:43.632
You never fantasized
about another woman?

667
00:50:43.632 --> 00:50:45.040
Ahh...

668
00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:47.306
Come on.
- No. I don’t know. I...

669
00:50:47.306 --> 00:50:49.143
No. I. um...

670
00:50:51.013 --> 00:50:52.641
Has she ever
cheated on you?

671
00:50:52.641 --> 00:50:54.313
Oh. fuck you.
Has she?

672
00:50:54.313 --> 00:50:56.381
No.

673
00:50:56.381 --> 00:50:58.647
You’re not
basing that on trust. are you?

674
00:50:58.647 --> 00:51:00.385
I’m basing it on what I know.

675
00:51:00.385 --> 00:51:02.156
Do you feel you know

676
00:51:02.156 --> 00:51:04.488
how she would react
in every situation?

677
00:51:04.488 --> 00:51:06.688
Have you ever asked her
the question yourself?

678
00:51:06.688 --> 00:51:08.294
Hen’s not like that.

679
00:51:08.294 --> 00:51:10.098
But you don’t
actually believe

680
00:51:10.098 --> 00:51:12.034
you know Hen better
than she knows herself?

681
00:51:12.034 --> 00:51:14.333
I’m not saying that.
Look. there are

682
00:51:14.333 --> 00:51:17.138
things about her you don’t know
and will never know. OK?

683
00:51:17.138 --> 00:51:20.306
Thoughts. feelings.
all her years before you.

684
00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:27.115
Listen. mate.

685
00:51:29.051 --> 00:51:31.053
Hey.

686
00:51:31.053 --> 00:51:34.650
Look. she has desires
that existed before you

687
00:51:34.650 --> 00:51:37.059
and exist beyond you.

688
00:51:39.754 --> 00:51:42.130
You can accept that. right?
- No. I...

689
00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:43.296
Hey. Junior.

690
00:51:58.212 --> 00:52:00.379
I suppose you want me to stop.

691
00:52:02.546 --> 00:52:05.549
No. Why?

692
00:52:06.484 --> 00:52:08.651
You usually don’t like it.

693
00:52:10.092 --> 00:52:12.193
You used to tell me
not to play.

694
00:52:13.161 --> 00:52:14.657
Sorry?

695
00:52:18.265 --> 00:52:21.664
As long as we move
from day to day.

696
00:52:21.664 --> 00:52:25.272
living the routine
that was established...

697
00:52:25.272 --> 00:52:27.406
that you established...

698
00:52:28.737 --> 00:52:30.805
...you’re convinced I’m happy.

699
00:52:34.479 --> 00:52:38.714
Walking the same path
as everyone who came before me.

700
00:52:44.786 --> 00:52:46.854
Your mom.

701
00:52:46.854 --> 00:52:49.263
My mom.

702
00:52:49.263 --> 00:52:51.331
Their moms. Their moms.

703
00:53:15.355 --> 00:53:17.390
I’m starting to worry.

704
00:53:19.821 --> 00:53:22.758
- What if the rain never comes?
- Mm.

705
00:53:22.758 --> 00:53:24.826
I never want you to worry.

706
00:53:27.136 --> 00:53:28.599
Yeah. I know.

707
00:53:49.686 --> 00:53:53.162

710

I’ve never
talked about this stuff before.

711
00:54:09.178 --> 00:54:12.214
Really?
Mm-hm. Never.

712
00:54:13.413 --> 00:54:15.250
Hen?

713
00:54:15.250 --> 00:54:19.188
I just think having
other living things around...

714
00:54:19.188 --> 00:54:20.684
does something.

715
00:54:20.684 --> 00:54:22.587
Makes you hopeful. I think.

716
00:54:25.524 --> 00:54:27.757
I really miss the trees. though.

717
00:54:27.757 --> 00:54:29.594
Trees. though...

718
00:54:29.594 --> 00:54:32.234
The trees?

719
00:54:32.234 --> 00:54:36.469
Yeah. more of them were
around when I was growing up.

720
00:54:36.469 --> 00:54:40.605
Some were. um...
some were shy.

721
00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:49.350
And then others were
really bold and ancient.

722
00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:52.848
Wise.

723
00:54:52.848 --> 00:54:55.818
You only have to spend time
with them and I just...

724
00:54:55.818 --> 00:54:58.227
I love their personalities
so much.

725
00:54:58.227 --> 00:54:59.558
Personalities?

726
00:54:59.558 --> 00:55:01.395
Junior thinks I’m crazy.

727
00:55:01.395 --> 00:55:03.826
but. I mean. people do.

728
00:55:03.826 --> 00:55:07.698
Dogs do. Cats do.

729
00:55:07.698 --> 00:55:10.437
Why would you draw a line
with trees?

730
00:55:12.406 --> 00:55:15.244
I don’t know.

731
00:55:15.244 --> 00:55:18.973
It’s sad we need proof
to believe in something.

732
00:55:18.973 --> 00:55:21.448
Belief is deceptive.

733
00:55:21.448 --> 00:55:23.384
Mm...

734
00:55:23.384 --> 00:55:27.014
No. it’s not. It’s...

735
00:55:27.014 --> 00:55:29.522
It’s a feeling
and when you have it.

736
00:55:29.522 --> 00:55:32.558
it is... it’s exhilarating.

737
00:55:43.998 --> 00:55:46.968
Can we talk
about the piano?

738
00:55:46.968 --> 00:55:48.343
OK.

739
00:55:49.410 --> 00:55:51.610
Why the basement?

740
00:55:51.610 --> 00:55:54.382
Looks like it hasn’t
been played in years.

741
00:55:56.384 --> 00:55:58.551
He doesn’t like it
when I play.

742
00:56:01.686 --> 00:56:05.723
Maybe it’s what’s in the music
that scares him. I don’t know.

743
00:56:05.723 --> 00:56:07.428
What’s in it?

744
00:56:07.428 --> 00:56:09.694
All that’s gone.

745
00:56:11.498 --> 00:56:13.599
Gone?

746
00:56:13.599 --> 00:56:17.405
Affection. Possibility.

747
00:56:17.405 --> 00:56:22.476
Um... curiosity.
That’s... that’s a big one.

748
00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:27.811
He used to love that about me.

749
00:56:30.077 --> 00:56:33.751
Do you think knowing
Junior for as long as you have

750
00:56:33.751 --> 00:56:36.050
has taken that away?

751
00:56:41.330 --> 00:56:42.661
In the beginning.

752
00:56:42.661 --> 00:56:46.863
everything feels so alive and...

753
00:56:46.863 --> 00:56:49.030
exciting.

754
00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:52.671
But time makes it predictable.

755
00:56:52.671 --> 00:56:55.674
He doesn’t really
see me anymore.

756
00:56:55.674 --> 00:56:59.711
It’s as if he’s replaced me
with someone else.

757
00:56:59.711 --> 00:57:03.616
I’ve lost those parts
of who I am...

758
00:57:03.616 --> 00:57:05.981
or who I could be.

759
00:57:05.981 --> 00:57:09.919
And... I’m scared
I won’t ever get them back.

760
00:57:11.723 --> 00:57:13.989
Maybe I shouldn’t
be telling you this.

761
00:57:15.958 --> 00:57:18.565
Why would you
live with that fear?

762
00:57:20.765 --> 00:57:23.438
Don’t deny yourself
those parts.

763
00:57:23.438 --> 00:57:25.473
No. I don’t want to anymore.

764
00:57:25.473 --> 00:57:27.409
Good. Good.

765
00:57:27.409 --> 00:57:30.610
I encourage you
to use this opportunity

766
00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:33.514
to act on your instincts.

767
00:57:35.648 --> 00:57:37.584
How real will he look?

768
00:57:37.584 --> 00:57:39.080
Identical.

769
00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:42.490
Will he behave
like Junior?

770
00:57:42.490 --> 00:57:44.657
Just like
when you first knew him.

your hydration levels.

01:02:09.790 --> 01:02:11.022
What’s that?

829
01:02:12.694 --> 01:02:14.894
Your wife. Junior.

830
01:02:14.894 --> 01:02:17.732
Is she open and honest
with her preferences?

831
01:02:17.732 --> 01:02:21.769
- About what?
- Come on. You know.

832
01:02:21.769 --> 01:02:23.034
Fucking.

833
01:02:24.365 --> 01:02:27.137
Is she explicit
about what she likes?

834
01:02:27.137 --> 01:02:29.304
What did you just say?
- What she needs.

835
01:02:29.304 --> 01:02:31.207
- What?
- Every relationship depends

836
01:02:31.207 --> 01:02:33.044
on open and honest communication.

837
01:02:33.044 --> 01:02:35.409
Oh. fuck you.
You know that.

No. No. I’m...

843
01:02:58.333 --> 01:03:00.104
You two fascinate me.

844
01:03:00.104 --> 01:03:01.842
People fascinate me too.

845
01:03:01.842 --> 01:03:04.713
Really?
- Mm.

846
01:03:04.713 --> 01:03:07.914
I watch people sometimes.

847
01:03:07.914 --> 01:03:09.916
See things.

848
01:03:09.916 --> 01:03:11.478
What do you see?

849
01:03:15.790 --> 01:03:18.089
The guys in the lunch room. right?

850
01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:22.390
They bite
hunks of their sandwiches.

851
01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:24.733
meat and bread.

852
01:03:24.733 --> 01:03:26.229
and they...

853
01:03:26.229 --> 01:03:29.067
they grind it together
into some disgusting paste.

854
01:03:29.067 --> 01:03:32.334
And whatever wasn’t swallowed
would just be stuck...

855
01:03:32.334 --> 01:03:35.304
between yellow teeth
and infected gums.

856
01:03:40.276 --> 01:03:42.982
And it’s not just eating.

857
01:03:42.982 --> 01:03:44.247
No.

858
01:03:45.919 --> 01:03:47.855
I’ve seen a co-worker
fall asleep

859
01:03:47.855 --> 01:03:50.451
with his mouth gaping open.

860
01:03:50.451 --> 01:03:53.388
And I felt sick
at the sight of it.

861
01:03:53.388 --> 01:03:56.831
I mean. think about...

862
01:03:56.831 --> 01:04:00.527
earwax and pus and fingernails.

863
01:04:00.527 --> 01:04:02.331
I...I...

864
01:04:04.399 --> 01:04:08.777
I’ve seen guys spit on
the ground and just walk away.

865
01:04:08.777 --> 01:04:11.978
Just walk away
and they don’t...

866
01:04:11.978 --> 01:04:15.179
I mean. we’re fucking oblivious
to it most of the time!

867
01:04:15.179 --> 01:04:17.786
We don’t even fucking see it!

868
01:04:22.252 --> 01:04:24.188
But one day...

869
01:04:28.192 --> 01:04:31.129
...I...I started to wonder
why that is.

870
01:04:33.428 --> 01:04:35.298
And then one of the guys.

871
01:04:35.298 --> 01:04:38.906
he wipes his fucking nose
with his fucking napkin.

872
01:04:38.906 --> 01:04:40.941
Just balls it up.
drops it on the plate.

873
01:04:40.941 --> 01:04:43.108
full of fucking snot.

874
01:04:46.078 --> 01:04:49.114
And then very slowly...

875
01:04:49.114 --> 01:04:51.446
it just started to unfurl.

876
01:04:54.053 --> 01:04:55.549
All on its own.

877
01:04:57.287 --> 01:04:59.993
As if it wanted to be seen.

878
01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:03.425
And then. I mean.
that’s when I realized

879
01:05:03.425 --> 01:05:05.526
our common seam in each of us

880
01:05:05.526 --> 01:05:09.167
is our own
built-in fucking scum.

881
01:05:11.235 --> 01:05:15.976
Our dirt. Our grease.

882
01:05:18.176 --> 01:05:19.980
- Fuck you!

883
01:05:24.886 --> 01:05:26.415
What the hell
is going on?!

884
01:05:27.856 --> 01:05:29.583
Hen. everything’s fine!

885
01:05:29.583 --> 01:05:31.387
Let me in!
He’s fine!

886
01:05:31.387 --> 01:05:33.158
- Let me in!
- He’s fine!

887
01:05:33.158 --> 01:05:35.094
It’s OK!
Junior!

888
01:05:35.094 --> 01:05:37.459
Stop! He’s fine.
Let me in. Terrance!

889
01:05:37.459 --> 01:05:39.934
Fucking Terrance.
open the fucking door!

890
01:05:39.934 --> 01:05:42.101
Go downstairs!
He’s fine!

891
01:05:44.136 --> 01:05:46.105
No!

892
01:05:50.208 --> 01:05:53.442
Jeez! Hell!

893
01:06:15.365 --> 01:06:17.334
No.

894
01:06:21.008 --> 01:06:23.538
This is fucking crazy.

895
01:06:27.377 --> 01:06:32.085
What’s a boat
without an anchor?

896
01:06:42.656 --> 01:06:44.427
Little Hen.

897
01:06:48.596 --> 01:06:50.268
I’m here.

898
01:07:03.017 --> 01:07:05.118
I was just taking a shower.

899
01:07:13.423 --> 01:07:15.128
It’s OK.

900
01:07:20.001 --> 01:07:21.266
Shhh.

901
01:07:29.142 --> 01:07:34.378
When I get back.
let’s do something.

902
01:07:36.743 --> 01:07:38.415
Go somewhere.

903
01:07:43.090 --> 01:07:44.652
Make a family.

904
01:07:49.492 --> 01:07:54.365
But whatever we decide to do.
let’s decide together. OK?

905
01:07:56.499 --> 01:07:58.270
Mm-hm.

906
01:07:58.270 --> 01:08:00.041
We’ll be together.

907
01:08:02.571 --> 01:08:05.079
Like we used to be.

908
01:10:49.177 --> 01:10:50.772
Fucking cowards!

909
01:11:48.698 --> 01:11:50.601
Keep a low profile.

910
01:11:50.601 --> 01:11:52.306
Yes.

911
01:11:52.306 --> 01:11:54.473
I’m going
to go upstairs and get going.

912
01:13:01.309 --> 01:13:03.971
When Hen played the piano.

913
01:13:03.971 --> 01:13:05.643
did you like it?

914
01:13:05.643 --> 01:13:08.382
Oh. I don’t really remember.

915
01:13:08.382 --> 01:13:10.043
Why are you asking me that?

916
01:13:10.043 --> 01:13:12.650
She said you’re
the reason she doesn’t play.

917
01:13:13.849 --> 01:13:15.752
She told you that?

918
01:13:18.084 --> 01:13:22.462
When you listened to
it. how did it make you feel?

919
01:13:25.564 --> 01:13:29.095
I...I enjoyed it
in the beginning. but...

920
01:13:31.031 --> 01:13:32.703
...it changed her.

921
01:13:32.703 --> 01:13:34.067
Changed her?

922
01:13:36.509 --> 01:13:39.908
I didn’t know
who she was when she played.

923
01:13:39.908 --> 01:13:43.747
like she was trying
to be someone else.

924
01:13:45.848 --> 01:13:47.982
That was...

925
01:13:47.982 --> 01:13:50.754
That was a while ago.
- God.

926
01:13:50.754 --> 01:13:53.790
How does it feel
to listen to that now.

927
01:13:53.790 --> 01:13:55.561
having gone through it?

928
01:13:58.597 --> 01:14:01.127
I’ve always had this fantasy that...

929
01:14:03.833 --> 01:14:06.968
...there’s something else
out there for me.

930
01:14:06.968 --> 01:14:09.443
What do you think
it would take?

931
01:14:09.443 --> 01:14:11.104
To leave?
Yeah.

932
01:14:13.139 --> 01:14:14.778
Courage.

933
01:14:17.979 --> 01:14:21.048
The courage
to let everything go.

934
01:14:22.654 --> 01:14:24.524
Mm.

935
01:14:24.524 --> 01:14:26.757
Follow what I feel.

936
01:14:26.757 --> 01:14:28.594
Not be scared.

937
01:14:34.633 --> 01:14:37.405
And where would you go?

938
01:14:37.405 --> 01:14:40.441
There are places. There’s...

939
01:14:40.441 --> 01:14:44.005
There’s places with life.

940
01:14:44.005 --> 01:14:46.447
Mmm.
- Places with other people.

941
01:14:46.447 --> 01:14:49.648
God. with new people.

942
01:14:50.814 --> 01:14:52.783
With music.

943
01:14:52.783 --> 01:14:54.752
Mmm.

944
01:14:54.752 --> 01:14:58.525
Somewhere that just
doesn’t feel like it’s dying.

945
01:15:02.529 --> 01:15:05.466
And instead of...

946
01:15:05.466 --> 01:15:07.534
trying to explain that
to him...

947
01:15:07.534 --> 01:15:09.866
...or to justify it.

948
01:15:09.866 --> 01:15:12.803
I would just do the opposite.

949
01:15:12.803 --> 01:15:16.807
I’d leave a letter.
but it would be blank.

950
01:15:18.842 --> 01:15:20.778
So... so nothing at all?

951
01:15:24.551 --> 01:15:28.951
It would say nothing and
everything at the same time.

952
01:15:28.951 --> 01:15:30.920
Oh...

953
01:15:37.531 --> 01:15:41.029
You know I can
help you. if you do decide.

954
01:15:41.029 --> 01:15:43.130
I know what he needs.
- I’ll be OK.

955
01:15:43.130 --> 01:15:44.835
Yeah.

956
01:15:53.712 --> 01:15:55.549
You’re a lying piece of shit.

957
01:15:55.549 --> 01:15:57.111
We’re going to
clarify everything.

958
01:15:57.111 --> 01:15:59.113
Oh. it’s pretty fucking
obvious. though.

959
01:15:59.113 --> 01:16:01.687
So. tell me.
- No. this is over. Terrance.

960
01:16:01.687 --> 01:16:03.656
You’re fucking leaving now.

961
01:16:03.656 --> 01:16:05.185
And. baby. we’re gonna talk.

962
01:16:05.185 --> 01:16:07.825
Baby. you’re gonna talk to
me properly. No more bullshit.

963
01:16:07.825 --> 01:16:09.728
What do you think is going on?

964
01:16:09.728 --> 01:16:13.028
No. no. no. no. No more
fucking questions. Terrance.

965
01:16:13.028 --> 01:16:15.129
Hen. this has got to stop. OK?

966
01:16:15.129 --> 01:16:16.636
OK.

967
01:16:18.066 --> 01:16:21.069
Yeah. Yeah. you want my wife.
don’t you?

968
01:16:21.069 --> 01:16:23.940
Yeah? Yeah. you want to keep
her company while I’m gone.

969
01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:25.271
Calm down. Calm down.

970
01:16:25.271 --> 01:16:27.515
You’re fucking sick.
Terrance!

971
01:16:27.515 --> 01:16:29.209
Hey. hey. it’s OK.

972
01:16:29.209 --> 01:16:31.046
Junior! Junior. Stop.

973
01:16:31.046 --> 01:16:33.213
Hey. Hey.
It’s not what you think.

974
01:16:33.213 --> 01:16:34.918
It’s not what you think.

975
01:16:37.184 --> 01:16:38.955
Fucking do something.

976
01:16:46.732 --> 01:16:50.032
♪ Although the sun is shining

977
01:16:50.032 --> 01:16:52.265
♪ High above

978
01:16:54.168 --> 01:16:57.138
♪ The one thing on my mind

979
01:16:57.138 --> 01:16:59.580
♪ Is you my love... ♪
It’s OK.

980
01:17:00.306 --> 01:17:01.648
No!

981
01:18:08.847 --> 01:18:13.280
Hey. I’ve missed you.

982
01:18:18.219 --> 01:18:20.089
It’s so good
to be back.

983
01:18:38.074 --> 01:18:39.779
It’s time.

984
01:18:42.111 --> 01:18:43.816
OK.

985
01:18:43.816 --> 01:18:45.752
You coming?

986
01:18:45.752 --> 01:18:47.116
You go.

987
01:18:48.414 --> 01:18:49.789
OK.

988
01:19:07.037 --> 01:19:09.941
No. you fucking calm down...

989
01:19:17.047 --> 01:19:18.818
Fucking Terrance.

990
01:19:18.818 --> 01:19:20.314
open the fucking door!

991
01:19:35.868 --> 01:19:40.136
Holy shit.
It’s so fucking real.

992
01:19:46.472 --> 01:19:48.375
Hen?

993
01:19:48.375 --> 01:19:50.410
I’m sorry.

994
01:19:50.410 --> 01:19:51.950
Hen?

995
01:19:52.951 --> 01:19:55.250
I know you’re confused.

996
01:20:06.393 --> 01:20:12.839
Oh. no. Oh. no...

997
01:20:12.839 --> 01:20:16.205
I know how you must be feeling.
but I need you to stay calm.

998
01:20:16.205 --> 01:20:18.779
Ohh...

999
01:20:22.475 --> 01:20:25.148
I’m sorry
we had to deceive you.

1000
01:20:25.148 --> 01:20:26.787
but it was the only way

1001
01:20:26.787 --> 01:20:30.087
to test your full capacity
and function.

1002
01:20:30.087 --> 01:20:32.188
It’s critical that
you were lucid enough

1003
01:20:32.188 --> 01:20:34.993
to experience the reversal
face-to-face.

1004
01:20:37.193 --> 01:20:40.196
This is
not the replacement. Junior.

1005
01:20:41.329 --> 01:20:44.838
It’s you.
You’re the replacement.

1006
01:20:44.838 --> 01:20:48.105
Oh! No.

1007
01:20:48.105 --> 01:20:50.503
This...
- No...

1008
01:20:50.503 --> 01:20:53.077
This is Hen’s real husband. OK?

1009
01:20:53.077 --> 01:20:56.916
No.
No. no. no. that’s bullshit!

1010
01:20:56.916 --> 01:20:59.446
- Terrance. where is she?
- She’s safe in the house.

1011
01:20:59.446 --> 01:21:01.921
Where is she? Hen? Hen!

1012
01:21:01.921 --> 01:21:05.386
Please! Hen. don’t listen
to ’em. OK?

1013
01:21:05.386 --> 01:21:08.290
What... I’m not gonna let them
do anything to you. OK?

1014
01:21:08.290 --> 01:21:10.259
I’m not going anywhere. baby.

1015
01:21:16.166 --> 01:21:20.269
The same day Junior left
to live on the installation.

1016
01:21:26.341 --> 01:21:29.047
When our headlights
turned you on...

1017
01:21:32.314 --> 01:21:34.217
...that was the beginning.

1018
01:21:36.285 --> 01:21:38.254
That was the day
your mission started.

1019
01:21:46.262 --> 01:21:51.938
You were free to experience
a real. human relationship.

1020
01:21:55.073 --> 01:21:58.109
We wanted your
focus to be your present-tense.

1021
01:21:58.109 --> 01:22:00.012
but we had to design
your memory.

1022
01:22:00.012 --> 01:22:01.541
You’re a fucking liar.

1023
01:22:01.541 --> 01:22:04.511
We gave that to you
after spending many months

1024
01:22:04.511 --> 01:22:07.580
talking with Junior
before he left.

1025
01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:10.858
Hen!

1026
01:22:10.858 --> 01:22:13.058
I need to know you’re OK.

1027
01:22:13.058 --> 01:22:16.193
I need you here.
I need to hear your voice.

1028
01:22:16.193 --> 01:22:17.898
Hen!

1029
01:22:17.898 --> 01:22:20.131
Hen?

1030
01:22:20.131 --> 01:22:22.463
Your memories are his.

1031
01:22:38.347 --> 01:22:39.986
Oh.

1032
01:22:39.986 --> 01:22:41.614
It’s OK.

1033
01:22:41.614 --> 01:22:45.453
It’s OK. it’s OK.
I’m here. I’m here.

1034
01:22:45.453 --> 01:22:49.028
Baby. Baby.
Terrance is wrong. OK?

1035
01:22:49.028 --> 01:22:50.458
Whatever this is.

1036
01:22:50.458 --> 01:22:53.230
whatever you’ve done.
it doesn’t matter. OK?

1037
01:22:53.230 --> 01:22:55.100
Why?

1038
01:22:57.036 --> 01:22:58.565
I’m sorry.
No.

1039
01:22:58.565 --> 01:23:01.238
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

1040
01:23:01.238 --> 01:23:03.405
Sorry.
I’m so sorry.

1041
01:23:03.405 --> 01:23:05.374
I am sorry.

1042
01:23:05.374 --> 01:23:07.211
I love you.

1043
01:23:08.344 --> 01:23:10.379
I love you.
I love you too.

1044
01:23:10.379 --> 01:23:14.218
You have to go.
- It’s OK.

1045
01:23:14.218 --> 01:23:16.286
I love you.
No...

1046
01:23:16.286 --> 01:23:19.058
You have to go. baby.
- No...

1047
01:23:21.654 --> 01:23:25.064
Don’t. Don’t do this.
Please don’t do this.

1048
01:23:27.264 --> 01:23:30.102
- No!
- No. no. no. no. no!

1049
01:23:30.102 --> 01:23:32.203
No! No. get the fuck off of me!

1050
01:23:32.203 --> 01:23:35.305
No. no. baby. please!
- No!

1051
01:23:35.305 --> 01:23:36.944
Please! Hen!

1052
01:23:36.944 --> 01:23:39.441
Baby! Baby. please!

1053
01:23:39.441 --> 01:23:45.249
Shame on you! Shame on you!

1054
01:23:45.249 --> 01:23:48.516
You’re going to hell! Fuck you!

1055
01:23:48.516 --> 01:23:50.584
Hen. no!

1056
01:23:52.685 --> 01:23:55.391
This can never
be forgiven!

1057
01:23:57.195 --> 01:24:00.066
Get off of me!

1058
01:24:01.969 --> 01:24:04.301
Get off of me!

1059
01:24:04.301 --> 01:24:05.599
No!

1060
01:24:47.113 --> 01:24:49.610
No. No!

1061
01:24:49.610 --> 01:24:53.647
No! Get off of me!

1062
01:25:16.703 --> 01:25:20.377
There were other possibilities
for how this part might go.

1063
01:25:20.377 --> 01:25:24.117
We set out to create consciousness.

1064
01:25:24.117 --> 01:25:29.353
To validate it
through real human connection.

1065
01:25:29.353 --> 01:25:31.520
But we never dreamed Hen
would experience love.

1066
01:25:41.629 --> 01:25:43.268
Junior.

1067
01:25:44.764 --> 01:25:47.206
Hen had no idea
how this would end.

1068
01:25:48.306 --> 01:25:50.539
I never told her.

1069
01:25:50.539 --> 01:25:53.410
You’re not real.

1070
01:25:53.410 --> 01:25:56.479
But what you have both
shown us here tonight...

1071
01:25:56.479 --> 01:25:58.844
is a gift to humanity.

1072
01:25:58.844 --> 01:26:01.583
This is my life.

1073
01:26:04.586 --> 01:26:07.721
This is our life.

1074
01:26:11.329 --> 01:26:14.431
They’re going to be
writing about you for years.

1075
01:26:21.339 --> 01:26:22.802
Hen.

1076
01:26:32.581 --> 01:26:34.286
Hi.

1077
01:26:45.693 --> 01:26:48.234
We’ll go somewhere else.

1078
01:26:56.209 --> 01:26:57.705
I’m sorry.

1079
01:27:52.298 --> 01:27:53.761
Thank you.

1080
01:28:12.318 --> 01:28:14.716
No. I’m fine.

1081
01:28:17.257 --> 01:28:20.788
Oh. fuck this gravity shit.

1082
01:30:44.569 --> 01:30:46.032
Why?

1083
01:30:48.969 --> 01:30:54.975
I was. oh. hoping for loyalty.

1084
01:30:54.975 --> 01:30:56.614
Trust.

1085
01:30:57.780 --> 01:30:59.485
How can you say that?

1086
01:30:59.485 --> 01:31:01.718
’Cause you’re my fucking wife.

1087
01:31:01.718 --> 01:31:03.885
There were rules. We agreed.

1088
01:31:03.885 --> 01:31:05.722
It’s not like that.
- OK.

1089
01:31:05.722 --> 01:31:08.153
Then. explain.
What is it like?

1090
01:31:08.153 --> 01:31:10.397
This wasn’t an affair.

1091
01:31:13.763 --> 01:31:16.799
I saw you in him.

1092
01:31:17.899 --> 01:31:20.066
You saw me in it?

1093
01:31:21.067 --> 01:31:23.509
I saw what we’ve lost.

1094
01:31:27.777 --> 01:31:30.846
It’s you
that I fell in love with again.

1095
01:31:30.846 --> 01:31:35.653
It wasn’t me. Hen.
It wasn’t real.

1096
01:31:35.653 --> 01:31:37.622
What I’m feeling is real.

1097
01:31:37.622 --> 01:31:40.988
I know what’s real
and what we need.

1098
01:31:40.988 --> 01:31:44.596
And what is that?

1099
01:31:44.596 --> 01:31:47.467
Is that to take each other
for granted?

1100
01:31:47.467 --> 01:31:48.534
No?

1101
01:31:48.534 --> 01:31:50.030
No.

1102
01:31:50.030 --> 01:31:52.571
Is that to just stay like this?

1103
01:31:52.571 --> 01:31:55.442
To just stand still? For what?

1104
01:31:57.444 --> 01:31:59.776
We had dreams together. remember?

1105
01:31:59.776 --> 01:32:02.108
We can just leave and
we can just get out of here.

1106
01:32:02.108 --> 01:32:04.583
- We can do something together.
- My family is buried

1107
01:32:04.583 --> 01:32:06.783
out there
in the fucking ground!

1108
01:32:06.783 --> 01:32:11.018
I can’t throw it all away to
go off on some fucking wander

1109
01:32:11.018 --> 01:32:14.153
that proves nothing.

1110
01:32:14.153 --> 01:32:19.862
This farm. this house.
this life. it’s us. Hen.

1111
01:32:19.862 --> 01:32:22.799
We made it. We should
be fucking proud.

1112
01:32:26.066 --> 01:32:28.838
There is nothing out there
for you.

1113
01:32:32.809 --> 01:32:34.943
I know that now.
There’s nothing.

1114
01:32:39.585 --> 01:32:40.949
Ah...

1115
01:33:14.279 --> 01:33:15.753

Oh! I’m sorry.

1130
01:34:08.102 --> 01:34:10.577
I’m sorry.

1131

Come on.
I’ll help you up. Come on.

1132
