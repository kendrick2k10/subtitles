00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:37.647
'Cause we were starting
to go into a lockdown.

174
00:08:37.778 --> 00:08:39.344
People are so scared of airports
right now.

175
00:08:39.475 --> 00:08:42.870
and I was going on a flight
to Miami for spring break.

176
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.307
and I was like.
"They hate spring break."

177
00:08:45.437 --> 00:08:48.092
So I was just like. perfect
opportunity to mix that all up.

178
00:08:48.223 --> 00:08:51.400
So I just went for it. and
I licked the airplane toilet.

179
00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:53.228
and I made the TikTok.

180
00:08:53.358 --> 00:08:55.796
Obviously cleaned the toilet
first. but that doesn't matter.

181
00:08:55.926 --> 00:08:57.624
I still licked the toilet.

182
00:09:02.585 --> 00:09:04.108
We didn't check my phone
for two hours.

183
00:09:04.239 --> 00:09:07.111
We go back. it's
at fucking 15 million views.

184
00:09:08.199 --> 00:09:09.636
And then I'm getting

185
00:09:09.766 --> 00:09:11.333
all kinds of calls and emails
from the news.

186
00:09:11.463 --> 00:09:13.770
That was my first time
being in the news.

187
00:09:13.901 --> 00:09:15.859
I loved how it felt.
I loved the clout.

188
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.339
I loved all the followers
I was getting.

189
00:09:17.469 --> 00:09:18.862
I loved all the attention.

190
00:09:18.993 --> 00:09:20.951
I loved the fighting.
the banter.

191
00:09:21.082 --> 00:09:23.301
just when I was gaining. the
interviews. I really liked it.

192
00:09:23.432 --> 00:09:25.477
That was probably
one of my biggest scandals.

193
00:09:25.608 --> 00:09:27.262
'cause that was
so international.

194
00:09:27.392 --> 00:09:28.872
and it was just wild.

195
00:09:29.003 --> 00:09:30.787
They wrote about my song
in the New York Times.

196
00:09:30.918 --> 00:09:32.746
Skinny Legend Anthem
isn't a good song.

197
00:09:32.876 --> 00:09:34.486
It's catchy.
but it's not a good song.

201

202
00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:46.498

and they did.

00:09:46.629 --> 00:09:48.283
And now I have millions
of streams on that.

204
00:09:48.413 --> 00:09:50.720
I made a lot of money off of it.
And it's like...

205
00:09:50.851 --> 00:09:52.983
all I had to do
is lick a toilet.

206
00:09:54.506 --> 00:09:56.378
I would do it again.

How much can you shock people?

213
00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:16.964
And that's the direction
that I kind of took it.

214
00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.795
Don't tell anyone. Okay?

215
00:10:21.925 --> 00:10:23.710
I couldn't find the bathroom.
- Hey?

216
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.842
- I couldn't find
the bathroom.

217
00:10:25.973 --> 00:10:28.062
Don't tell anyone. please.
Okay?

Just kidding.
It's a water bottle. man.

00:10:33.328 --> 00:10:35.983
It's a water bottle.
He was getting so scared.

220
00:10:36.113 --> 00:10:37.941
We had filmed his clip

221
00:10:38.072 --> 00:10:39.551
where I'd shot a pellet
through my cheek.

222
00:10:39.682 --> 00:10:41.553
So we took a pellet gun

223
00:10:41.684 --> 00:10:43.773
and put it on the inside
of my cheek.

224
00:10:43.904 --> 00:10:46.994
- Don't do it. Turner.
Oh!

225
00:10:47.124 --> 00:10:49.300
- Pretty graphic.
but it worked perfectly.

226
00:10:49.431 --> 00:10:51.085
It shot right through.

227
00:10:51.215 --> 00:10:53.565
I could squirt beer out of it.
It was pretty cool.

228
00:10:53.696 --> 00:10:55.002
And so I sent that over
to World Star.

229
00:10:55.132 --> 00:10:56.960
Sent that to a bunch of
meme pages on Instagram.

230
00:10:57.091 --> 00:10:59.833
And I think World Star
ended up picking it up.

231
00:10:59.963 --> 00:11:02.009
Got like a million views
on World Star

232
00:11:02.139 --> 00:11:03.619
in like an hour
or something like that.

233
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:06.317
and I just remember
I gained like 3.000 followers.

234
00:11:06.448 --> 00:11:08.102
I had. like. 600 followers
at the time.

235
00:11:08.232 --> 00:11:09.756
I gained 3.000 right there.

236
00:11:09.886 --> 00:11:12.541
And that's when I was kind
of like. Whoa. this is cool.

237
00:11:14.282 --> 00:11:16.893
The excitement. I can describe
exactly where I was that night.

00:11:17.024 --> 00:11:19.374
I was working at Panera Bread.

239
00:11:19.504 --> 00:11:21.028
I was a dishwasher there.

240
00:11:21.158 --> 00:11:23.552
and I guess I had my phone
not on silent.

241
00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:26.860
and I had my Instagram
notification bell still on.

242
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:28.122
And I remember...
[imitates dinging]

So I went to the washroom.

244
00:11:30.559 --> 00:11:32.692
and I'd seen everybody send it
in my DMs saying.

245
00:11:32.822 --> 00:11:34.737
"Yo. it's over 500.000 views."

246
00:11:34.868 --> 00:11:36.260

all this traction.

00:11:36.391 --> 00:11:38.872
I was like. holy...
I wanted to go home right there.

00:11:39.002 --> 00:11:40.830
I was so excited
to start replying to comments.

00:11:40.961 --> 00:11:42.353
And that's when I was kind
of like.

Whoa. this is kind of bigger
than just my hometown.

an emergency visit

to my shopper's office

00:14:31.653 --> 00:14:33.089
to get an outfit for court.

316
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.309
because Kim Kardashian's
literally suing me.

332
00:15:08.255 --> 00:15:10.170

was even crazier

Absolutely not.

00:15:26.621 --> 00:15:30.407
And then I find out recently
that Jeffree Star and Kanye West

342
00:15:30.538 --> 00:15:33.454
were the fourth most
Googled couple of 2021.

343
00:15:33.584 --> 00:15:35.891
So I had that much influence
and that much power.

344
00:15:37.066 --> 00:15:38.328
That was crazy.

345
00:15:43.812 --> 00:15:46.032
- My first job. I was 17.

346
00:15:46.162 --> 00:15:48.469
I worked at Taco Bell.

347
00:15:48.599 --> 00:15:49.687
Mostly as fast food.

348
00:15:49.818 --> 00:15:52.603
I worked at McDonald's.
Burger King.

349
00:15:52.734 --> 00:15:54.954
I worked at CVS.

350
00:15:55.084 --> 00:15:59.132
I realized when it comes
to being a content creator.

351
00:15:59.262 --> 00:16:02.700
it's about resources.
it's about money.

352
00:16:02.831 --> 00:16:05.573
I don't have that.
I never had that.

353
00:16:05.703 --> 00:16:08.010
Everything I had was...
you know. it's a sacrifice.

354
00:16:08.141 --> 00:16:10.795
If I lose my computer.
and everything that I have.

355
00:16:10.926 --> 00:16:12.928
I can't afford
to buy it again.

356
00:16:14.277 --> 00:16:16.540
When I started thinking about
the controversial videos

357
00:16:16.671 --> 00:16:18.934
and why I created that.
it was free to do that.

358
00:16:19.065 --> 00:16:22.329
I can use this
to build a audience.

359
00:16:22.459 --> 00:16:24.722
and I don't have to pay
for promotion for this.

360
00:16:24.853 --> 00:16:26.550
The promotion's going
to come to me.

361
00:16:26.681 --> 00:16:29.510
I'm going to go forward with
this and see where it takes me.

362
00:16:33.775 --> 00:16:37.170
The first thing I say is going
to catch people's attention.

363
00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.433
so I try to swear.
and just saying fuck it.

364
00:16:39.563 --> 00:16:41.565
People are going to be like.
Oh. is this guy serious?

365
00:16:41.696 --> 00:16:43.132
I have to get
into that character.

366
00:16:43.263 --> 00:16:45.004
and I have to make it
believable.

367
00:16:45.134 --> 00:16:47.441
I just try to be
very aggressive.

368
00:16:47.571 --> 00:16:49.399
That's what's going to get
people's attention.

369
00:16:51.967 --> 00:16:54.230
Fuck Rite Aid.
CVS. bitch!

370
00:16:54.361 --> 00:16:56.015
[crashing]

371
00:17:00.889 --> 00:17:03.196
[crashing]

372
00:17:04.284 --> 00:17:06.199
We don't support none of this
shit right here. nigga.

373
00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:08.331
And I didn't know
if it was going to go viral.

374
00:17:08.462 --> 00:17:10.203
I didn't know
if it was going to work.

375
00:17:10.333 --> 00:17:12.161
I believed it would.
but wasn't really sure.

376
00:17:14.468 --> 00:17:16.818
Within three days.
I got 100.000 views.

377
00:17:18.298 --> 00:17:19.995
I was very happy
when that video went viral.

378
00:17:20.126 --> 00:17:22.563
It could be addictive. getting
all that kind of attention.

379
00:17:24.304 --> 00:17:27.002
I was real happy.
and I'm like. Yo. this is crazy.

380
00:17:27.133 --> 00:17:28.786
However people feel about it.

381
00:17:28.917 --> 00:17:30.440
whether you think
it's funny or you don't.

382
00:17:30.571 --> 00:17:33.661
if I can monetize this. if I can
get a fan base from this.

383
00:17:33.791 --> 00:17:36.098
then that's for myself.

384
00:17:40.102 --> 00:17:43.018
- Why do content creators
not stop?

385
00:17:43.149 --> 00:17:46.326
Internet fame is a fame
unlike on any other.

386
00:17:46.456 --> 00:17:49.024
There is no way to experience
internet fame

387
00:17:49.155 --> 00:17:50.504
unless you've experienced it.

388
00:17:50.634 --> 00:17:52.245
There's a dopamine hit

389
00:17:52.375 --> 00:17:54.508
that has no tangible experience
in real life.

390
00:17:54.638 --> 00:17:55.900
In fact. if anything.

391
00:17:56.031 --> 00:17:58.294
it's incredibly hard to describe

392
00:17:58.425 --> 00:18:01.123
internet fame to someone
outside the internet.

393
00:18:01.254 --> 00:18:03.691
That is a platform exploit
designed specifically

394
00:18:03.821 --> 00:18:06.128
to train people to do it again

395
00:18:06.259 --> 00:18:07.782
and then do it again
and do it again.

396
00:18:07.912 --> 00:18:10.872
- And that's why it becomes
an addiction for them.

397
00:18:11.002 --> 00:18:15.094
My name is Dr. Donna Rockwell.
and I'm a clinical psychologist.

398
00:18:15.224 --> 00:18:18.053
One of my key research interests

399
00:18:18.184 --> 00:18:20.708
is the psychology
of fame and celebrity.

400
00:18:20.838 --> 00:18:24.929
When somebody recognizes you.
when someone adores you.

401
00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:29.064
they become used to it. and
they want that hit of dopamine.

402
00:18:29.195 --> 00:18:31.719
but it can't last forever.

403
00:18:31.849 --> 00:18:34.287
[cheering]

404
00:18:37.638 --> 00:18:39.161
- Tell me your thoughts on this.
Are you excited?

405
00:18:39.292 --> 00:18:42.077
- I actually am.
No one wants to do it.

406
00:18:42.208 --> 00:18:43.470
I want to do this.
This is a great idea.

407
00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.341
- Yeah.
- I'm Jacob Hillhouse.

408
00:18:45.472 --> 00:18:46.951
and this is
the porta-potty rave.

409
00:18:47.082 --> 00:18:50.041
[shouting]

410
00:18:50.172 --> 00:18:52.174
I remember when
I first started this.

411
00:18:52.305 --> 00:18:55.395
one of my biggest inspirations.
Steve-O.

412
00:18:55.525 --> 00:18:57.658
I posted on Facebook.
you can go find it.

413
00:18:57.788 --> 00:18:59.355
I said. I'm manifesting this.

414
00:18:59.486 --> 00:19:02.619
I'm going to work with Steve-O
sooner than later.

415
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:04.491
2019. I got to work with him.
We did a video.

416
00:19:04.621 --> 00:19:06.362
He tattooed me.

417
00:19:06.493 --> 00:19:09.365
I actually have a tramp stamp
now. which is awesome.

418
00:19:09.496 --> 00:19:11.193
So that's one of
my biggest wins.

419
00:19:11.324 --> 00:19:12.977
I keep mentioning Jackass.

420
00:19:13.108 --> 00:19:14.501
but it's because
they're such a staple

421
00:19:14.631 --> 00:19:17.721
in this whole
content creation side.

422
00:19:17.852 --> 00:19:19.810
where when they stopped
making movies and stuff.

423
00:19:19.941 --> 00:19:21.943
there was a little hole
that wasn't filled anymore.

424
00:19:22.073 --> 00:19:23.510
You had a few one-offs.

425
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.599
but there was never people
that loved the craft

426
00:19:25.729 --> 00:19:27.644
of doing a stunt.
- Ready to see a big miss?

427
00:19:27.775 --> 00:19:29.080
- Buddy. I played a lot of Nerf
back in the day.

428
00:19:29.211 --> 00:19:30.299
- Ooh...!

429
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:33.911
[laughing]

430
00:19:34.042 --> 00:19:36.566
- I can do these crazy things.
I can make these awesome videos.

431
00:19:36.697 --> 00:19:39.308
I can create this content
without anything.

432
00:19:52.147 --> 00:19:53.322
- Hey. I remember
when I was a kid.

433
00:19:53.453 --> 00:19:54.976
I used to try to get away
with everything.

434
00:19:55.106 --> 00:19:57.413
Now I don't give a fuck.

435
00:20:00.329 --> 00:20:03.332
The next video I would post
would be

436
00:20:03.463 --> 00:20:06.117
a video that I did walking into
CVS. stealing.

437
00:20:06.248 --> 00:20:08.032
[man]: How much is that?

438
00:20:08.163 --> 00:20:10.252
- $19.99? Sheesh!

439
00:20:10.383 --> 00:20:12.559
That's way too much.

440
00:20:12.689 --> 00:20:16.606
Yeah. I'm going to just take
some Sour Patches.

441
00:20:16.737 --> 00:20:18.391
Lifesavers.

442
00:20:18.521 --> 00:20:20.480
- Can you get those
out of your pants?

443
00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:22.569
- Why would I take them
out of my pants?

444
00:20:22.699 --> 00:20:23.874
- Because it's disgusting.

445
00:20:24.005 --> 00:20:25.398
- Nah. I'm all good with that.

446
00:20:25.528 --> 00:20:27.269
I ended up getting arrested
for that.

447
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.053
I remember my first time
sitting in jail

448
00:20:29.184 --> 00:20:31.578
over these videos.

449
00:20:31.708 --> 00:20:33.449
I realized this is
way out of my control.

450
00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:34.624
I think I know
what I'm doing. but I don't.

451
00:20:34.755 --> 00:20:36.800
[crashing]

452
00:20:36.931 --> 00:20:38.498
When I was in jail.

453
00:20:38.628 --> 00:20:40.543
I knew that I was going
to have to make more videos.

454
00:20:40.674 --> 00:20:42.284
So that means I also have
to go to jail.

455
00:20:42.415 --> 00:20:44.678
When I get out of jail. I knew
that at some point in time.

456
00:20:44.808 --> 00:20:46.941
I was most likely
going to end up back in jail.

457
00:20:47.071 --> 00:20:50.074
- Going viral doesn't
guarantee

458
00:20:50.205 --> 00:20:52.163
you're going
to benefit financially.

459
00:20:52.294 --> 00:20:53.469
A lot of these influencers

460
00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.080
have to find ways
to make money themselves.

461
00:20:56.211 --> 00:20:58.779
- Gofundme.com/jumannestruggle.

462

463
00:21:08.136 --> 00:21:10.225
Follow me on Instagram.
@jumannestruggled

464
00:21:10.356 --> 00:21:12.183
- They're stuck trying
to figure out.

465
00:21:12.314 --> 00:21:14.447
"How am I going
to make money?"

466
00:21:15.535 --> 00:21:17.841
- Hello.
How's it going?

467
00:21:17.972 --> 00:21:21.062
I am Jade. also known
as Jadasaur.

468
00:21:21.192 --> 00:21:23.586
I love basketball.

469
00:21:23.717 --> 00:21:26.589
I like doing social experiments
just to see people's reactions.

470
00:21:27.982 --> 00:21:30.854
I'm a content creator.
so I like to make people laugh.

471
00:21:30.985 --> 00:21:34.075
I started just pumping out
content in Singapore for fun.

472
00:21:34.205 --> 00:21:36.773
because like. Okay.
this is a new experience.

473
00:21:36.904 --> 00:21:38.819
I didn't expect to gain
a following at all.

474
00:21:38.949 --> 00:21:40.647
I was just being stupid
in Singapore.

475
00:21:40.777 --> 00:21:42.605
and people.
they liked how weird I was.

476
00:21:43.737 --> 00:21:46.653
I was like. Oh. okay.
I'll just... Kept going.

477
00:21:46.783 --> 00:21:49.046
And that's when
the algorithm picked me up.

478
00:21:49.177 --> 00:21:51.135
It's like I won the lottery.

479
00:21:51.919 --> 00:21:54.574
Instagram is my funnel
for OnlyFans.

480
00:21:54.704 --> 00:21:57.533
and that's how I advertise
for OnlyFans.

481
00:21:57.664 --> 00:22:00.406
Instagram is the main advertiser
for OnlyFans.

482
00:22:00.536 --> 00:22:02.451
They come from TikTok
to Instagram.

483
00:22:02.582 --> 00:22:04.540
and then Instagram
to OnlyFans.

484
00:22:08.457 --> 00:22:10.851
Honestly. OnlyFans has
changed my life.

485
00:22:10.981 --> 00:22:13.767
It's given me financial freedom.
I wouldn't be able to live here

486
00:22:13.897 --> 00:22:16.465
if it weren't for OnlyFans.
to be honest. so...

487
00:22:16.596 --> 00:22:19.990
It's made so many creators
millionaires.

488
00:22:20.121 --> 00:22:22.384
I never would've.
in a million years.

489
00:22:22.515 --> 00:22:25.474
thought that I could
make money monthly

490
00:22:25.605 --> 00:22:28.390
just selling my pictures
and videos.

491
00:22:28.521 --> 00:22:31.175
and it's great.
[laughing]

492
00:22:31.306 --> 00:22:34.614
I can't complain.
Yeah.

493
00:22:38.095 --> 00:22:40.620
- Instagram's a fantasy.
It really is a fantasy.

494
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:42.665
and it's like
you're going on there.

495
00:22:42.796 --> 00:22:44.493
you're seeing the best
presentation of everyone.

496
00:22:44.624 --> 00:22:46.887
And that's why
I have a huge emphasis

497
00:22:47.017 --> 00:22:49.629
on just being hot.
because it's like. I have to be.

498
00:22:49.759 --> 00:22:52.762
Like every time I get a new
surgery. or when I do something.

499
00:22:52.893 --> 00:22:55.722
every time I change my look
or whatever. it just like...

500
00:22:55.852 --> 00:22:57.680
it helps.

501
00:22:57.811 --> 00:23:01.336
- It's bigger than "sex sells."
but sexualized content sells.

502
00:23:01.467 --> 00:23:05.296
And we can do that in extreme
ways like pornography.

503
00:23:05.427 --> 00:23:07.603
or in sort of more mundane.
subtle ways.

504
00:23:07.734 --> 00:23:10.476
like certain poses
that are very sexualized

505
00:23:10.606 --> 00:23:13.914
and taken from
porn chic aesthetics.

506
00:23:14.044 --> 00:23:15.959
are very flirtatious.

507
00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:18.266
and mimic what we might see
in traditional pornography.

508
00:23:18.397 --> 00:23:20.355
So it might not be porn.

509
00:23:20.486 --> 00:23:24.490
but it takes all of the poses
and gestures

510
00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:26.666
and formats of porn.

511
00:23:26.796 --> 00:23:29.233
and waters it down
for a mainstream audience.

[hip hop music]

513
00:23:43.378 --> 00:23:45.032
- Can you can describe
where we are. or...?

514
00:23:45.162 --> 00:23:46.860
- We're in the smoosh room.

515
00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:50.820
This is where we make
OnlyFans content.

516
00:23:50.951 --> 00:23:55.042
We have all had sex
on this couch over the years

517

when his parents go on vacation.

518
00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:59.960
On Thanksgiving.
we had an orgy here.

519
00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:01.744
Seven people.

520
00:24:01.875 --> 00:24:03.442
It's very squeaky. though.

521
00:24:03.572 --> 00:24:05.966
- You would know better than me.

522
00:24:06.096 --> 00:24:07.750
You just got with someone here
the other day.

523
00:24:07.881 --> 00:24:09.752
- Yeah.
- Half of her videos

524
00:24:09.883 --> 00:24:13.103
I'm basically a director in.
- He films them.

525
00:24:13.234 --> 00:24:16.411
- Our trusty favorite.

526
00:24:16.542 --> 00:24:19.458
- This has been
inside of us both.

527
00:24:19.588 --> 00:24:21.677
- It's like show and tell.
[laughing]

528
00:24:22.896 --> 00:24:24.593
So. we have duct tape.

529
00:24:24.724 --> 00:24:26.856
- For bondage play.

530
00:24:26.987 --> 00:24:29.729
- A screwdriver that I don't
know why is in here.

531
00:24:29.859 --> 00:24:32.601
but check out Ava's OnlyFans
to find out.

532
00:24:32.732 --> 00:24:34.603
- Yeah.

533
00:24:34.734 --> 00:24:38.389
That clip goes on the wall
to make people horny.

534
00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.609
and then
we sell them our nudes.

535
00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:41.958
I know you've heard
of gay for pay.

536
00:24:42.089 --> 00:24:43.699
He'll do straight for pay.
- Yes.

537
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:45.745
Yeah.
Well. I'm not bi technically.

538
00:24:45.875 --> 00:24:47.790
but I'll do stuff for money.

539
00:24:47.921 --> 00:24:49.792
- Someone wanted him
to shit on camera once.

540
00:24:49.923 --> 00:24:51.446
- I know.

541
00:24:51.577 --> 00:24:54.101
- How much did they
pay for that?

542
00:24:54.231 --> 00:24:56.233
- It wasn't that much.

543
00:24:56.364 --> 00:25:00.194
I was really drunk.
I took whatever they offered.

544
00:25:00.324 --> 00:25:03.327
And then they unsubscribed.
so I don't think I did it right.

545
00:25:03.458 --> 00:25:06.113
- Yeah. our friend shit
on some guy in a basement

546
00:25:06.243 --> 00:25:07.897
for 10 grand.

547
00:25:08.028 --> 00:25:09.551
- See. that I would do.
- Me too.

548
00:25:09.682 --> 00:25:11.335
Shit all over that guy.

549
00:25:11.466 --> 00:25:13.337
- I respect the hustle.

550
00:25:13.468 --> 00:25:15.252
- I would do it too.

551
00:25:15.383 --> 00:25:17.516
This guy just subscribed.

552
00:25:17.646 --> 00:25:18.691
Time to tell him
thank you.

553
00:25:18.821 --> 00:25:21.171
"Thank you for subbing."

[light music]

555
00:25:33.357 --> 00:25:37.405
- Yeah. So the mime was an idea
that we came up with.

556
00:25:37.536 --> 00:25:39.276
'Cause mimes.
they're silent. right?

557
00:25:39.407 --> 00:25:41.235
So when you're in pain.

558
00:25:41.365 --> 00:25:43.629
most of the time you're making
some sort of noise.

559
00:25:43.759 --> 00:25:46.109
You're screaming a swear word
or something. Aaah!

560
00:25:47.589 --> 00:25:50.157
So we thought.
Let's do painful things.

561
00:25:50.287 --> 00:25:52.681
you'll dress up as a mime. and
then you can't make a noise.

562
00:25:52.812 --> 00:25:54.509
You have to just use
your facial expressions.

563
00:25:58.818 --> 00:26:00.428
It's a stunt.

564
00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:03.257
We get that shock value
and that craziness to it.

565
00:26:03.387 --> 00:26:05.346
but then there's comic value
behind it.

566
00:26:05.476 --> 00:26:06.782
There's comedy to it.
people are like.

567
00:26:06.913 --> 00:26:08.697
Oh. that was crazy.
but it was funny.

568
00:26:08.828 --> 00:26:10.525
And that's what made Jackass
so successful.

569
00:26:13.441 --> 00:26:14.790
I like watching people get hurt.

570
00:26:14.921 --> 00:26:16.836
I bet everybody here has
watched Ridiculousness

571
00:26:16.966 --> 00:26:18.794
or America's Funniest
Home Videos.

572
00:26:18.925 --> 00:26:21.014
People want to see it
all the time.

573
00:26:21.144 --> 00:26:23.103
so there's people now like me
on the internet

574
00:26:23.233 --> 00:26:25.627
that will do it for you. and
you can watch it all the time.

575
00:26:28.021 --> 00:26:31.285
So yeah. for the mime.
it blew up on TikTok originally.

576
00:26:31.415 --> 00:26:33.766
So like. okay. let's keep
the mime gig going.

577
00:26:33.896 --> 00:26:37.596
I think I gained like a million
on TikTok in like two weeks.

578
00:26:37.726 --> 00:26:39.598
I'd never seen those
numbers before. Right?

579
00:26:39.728 --> 00:26:41.904
We started uploading them
to YouTube.

580
00:26:42.035 --> 00:26:43.950
People started going over
to our YouTube

581
00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.082
because at the end of the day.
YouTube is the main goal;

582
00:26:46.213 --> 00:26:47.388
that's where we drive everybody.

583
00:26:47.518 --> 00:26:49.129
And people love it. so...

584
00:26:59.748 --> 00:27:02.969
- I go by either Easton _Cyruss
or Peter Teatime.

585
00:27:03.099 --> 00:27:05.362
depending on the platform
that you'll find me on.

586
00:27:05.493 --> 00:27:08.583
I feel like Easton _Cyruss and
the TikTok content is more...

587
00:27:08.714 --> 00:27:11.064
of just fast-paced bangers.

588
00:27:11.194 --> 00:27:13.370
whereas the Peter Teatime
content was supposed to be

589
00:27:13.501 --> 00:27:16.547
more about parkour
and training and athletic stuff

590
00:27:16.678 --> 00:27:18.898
versus the high-risk stuff.

591
00:27:19.028 --> 00:27:20.943
But now they've kind of blended
into all being...

592
00:27:21.074 --> 00:27:22.945
the high-risk stuff.
[chuckles]

593
00:27:23.076 --> 00:27:25.382
I just found more success

594
00:27:25.513 --> 00:27:27.994
through the high-risk stuff
online.

595
00:27:28.124 --> 00:27:29.996
and the success of it
made me want to pursue that

596
00:27:30.126 --> 00:27:31.084
more than the other avenues.

597
00:27:33.216 --> 00:27:35.523
- What we click on
and what we interact with.

598
00:27:35.654 --> 00:27:37.220
whether we like it or not.

599
00:27:37.351 --> 00:27:40.267
this new attention economy
is brokered by all of us.

600
00:27:40.397 --> 00:27:43.444
We are the ones that get to
decide as consumers

601
00:27:43.574 --> 00:27:46.708
what gets pushed to the top and
who makes it in this world.

602
00:27:53.584 --> 00:27:56.109
I think what most people
don't know about influencers

603
00:27:56.239 --> 00:27:57.763
is it's a ton of work.

604
00:27:57.893 --> 00:28:00.243

As far as in why people would
want to watch.

620
00:28:44.679 --> 00:28:48.901
people want to see someone
that just came from the bottom

621
00:28:49.031 --> 00:28:51.686
and found a way to make it
to the top.

622
00:28:51.817 --> 00:28:53.775
and that might attract people.

00:28:53.906 --> 00:28:56.082
I'm about to add you right now.

00:28:56.212 --> 00:28:58.475
Yo. what's up bro?
[fan]: I got a question for you.

625
00:28:58.606 --> 00:29:02.175
So in that one where you were
running through the store

626
00:29:02.305 --> 00:29:04.568
knocking stuff off the shelves.

627
00:29:04.699 --> 00:29:06.745
what was going
through your mind?

628
00:29:06.875 --> 00:29:08.747
- I know this might sound funny.

629
00:29:08.877 --> 00:29:12.228
but I'm trying to make sure
nobody hurts me.

630
00:29:12.359 --> 00:29:15.231
and I try not to get
into any physical altercations.

631
00:29:15.362 --> 00:29:16.798
You know what I'm saying?
[fan]: I don't blame you.

632
00:29:17.712 --> 00:29:19.888
- Hey. you got to fight Jake
Paul.

633
00:29:20.019 --> 00:29:22.021
- Jake Paul? Jake Paul
would probably knock me out.

634
00:29:22.151 --> 00:29:25.198
I'll get in the ring. though.
I'll do it.

635
00:29:25.328 --> 00:29:27.940
I would do it just for
the publicity. though. honestly.

636
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:29.419
- Yeah. you really got to.
You just got to...

637
00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:31.291
- Just for the publicity.

follow. they going to follow.

00:29:33.728 --> 00:29:35.599
The people that support
is going to support.

640
00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:37.558
And that's all I could do.
is just try my best

00:29:37.688 --> 00:29:40.169
to move in a direction
I want to go in.

642
00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:42.781
and I just have to continue
to move forward.

00:29:42.911 --> 00:29:44.608
I don't know
what the future holds.

644
00:29:44.739 --> 00:29:45.871

- I'm from Jamaica. bro.
- Jamaica. All right.

648
00:29:52.878 --> 00:29:54.836
I was just asking. but yeah.
All right. go ahead.

649
00:29:54.967 --> 00:29:56.533
My fault. bro.

650
00:29:56.664 --> 00:30:01.887
- One of your most iconic lines
was. "$19.99. nigga?"

651
00:30:02.017 --> 00:30:06.630
- Sheesh! Yeah.
- Oh. my God.

652
00:30:06.761 --> 00:30:08.807
- Someone asked the question.
he said.

653
00:30:08.937 --> 00:30:10.896
"When are you going
to become happy?"

654
00:30:11.026 --> 00:30:13.072
That's a good question.
bro.

655
00:30:13.202 --> 00:30:15.335
That's a good question. man.
I don't know.

656
00:30:15.465 --> 00:30:17.511
I'm probably not going to be
satisfied

657
00:30:17.641 --> 00:30:21.428
until I'm making money
as a full-time content creator.

658
00:30:23.517 --> 00:30:25.214
I've been contacted
by so many people.

659
00:30:25.345 --> 00:30:27.738
and I do have people
that tell me. you know.

660
00:30:27.869 --> 00:30:30.002
keep my head up
and move in a better direction.

661
00:30:30.132 --> 00:30:32.221
People understand
the way how I feel.

662
00:30:32.352 --> 00:30:34.049
So yeah. if I didn't have faith.

663
00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:35.964
I wouldn't have done
the videos that I did.

664
00:30:40.229 --> 00:30:43.015
- There are no rules
for being a content creator.

665
00:30:43.145 --> 00:30:45.800
There's no more ad breaks.

666
00:30:45.931 --> 00:30:49.848
there's no more adherence
to some sort of structural

667
00:30:49.978 --> 00:30:51.675
"You can and cannot do this."

668
00:30:51.806 --> 00:30:54.635
We have to be aware that the
rules aren't established

669
00:30:54.765 --> 00:30:56.376
by the structure any longer.

670
00:30:56.506 --> 00:30:58.726
The rules are established
by the content creator.

671
00:31:02.251 --> 00:31:04.688
So one of my most famous climbs

672
00:31:04.819 --> 00:31:08.127
was the Golden Gate Bridge
in San Francisco. California.

673
00:31:09.258 --> 00:31:11.870
Guys. we've just made it
to the top.

674
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.349
This is incredible
to be honest.

675
00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.308
It's so beautiful up here.

676
00:31:15.438 --> 00:31:18.006
And I'm not allowed to talk
about how I climbed the bridge

677
00:31:18.137 --> 00:31:20.095
or any aspects of the climb
itself.

678
00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:23.098
It's a federal monument.

679
00:31:23.229 --> 00:31:26.797
and the repercussions of
climbing it were pretty severe.

680
00:31:26.928 --> 00:31:29.148
A British agency.
they picked up the story

681
00:31:29.278 --> 00:31:32.151
and they aired it.
and that very same day.

682
00:31:32.281 --> 00:31:34.588
thousands of people were
messaging me. news companies.

683
00:31:34.718 --> 00:31:36.590
"Hey. we want to do
an interview with you."

684
00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.505
And the story just blew up.
And my video went

685
00:31:38.635 --> 00:31:40.637
from 10 views on YouTube
to like 150.000.

686
00:31:40.768 --> 00:31:42.988
It just took off.

687
00:31:43.118 --> 00:31:44.903
Started seeing some
of the ad revenue flow in.

688
00:31:45.033 --> 00:31:46.817
I got really excited about it.

689
00:31:46.948 --> 00:31:49.559
And then the legal ramifications
hit me.

690
00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:53.607
Homeland Security
and the FBI got involved.

691
00:31:53.737 --> 00:31:55.914
And so they tracked me down.
They got in contact with me

692
00:31:56.044 --> 00:31:58.525
and they came to meet with me
in Wisconsin.

693
00:31:58.655 --> 00:32:00.266
For starters.

694
00:32:00.396 --> 00:32:02.355
we got hit with the criminal
case of trespassing.

695
00:32:02.485 --> 00:32:05.445
And then on top of that.
we got sued

696
00:32:05.575 --> 00:32:07.577
by the Bridge Authority
themselves for $50.000.

697
00:32:07.708 --> 00:32:09.405
And they pretty much
interrogated me.

698
00:32:09.536 --> 00:32:11.277
and they ended up
asking me about

699
00:32:11.407 --> 00:32:14.149
how could they prevent
other people from climbing it.

700
00:32:15.498 --> 00:32:18.153
It became a very high-profile
case in San Francisco.

701
00:32:18.284 --> 00:32:20.199
It was in the news every day.

702
00:32:20.329 --> 00:32:22.027
And the lawyer who ended up
taking my case

703
00:32:22.157 --> 00:32:24.420
was a rock climber.
and he felt for us.

704
00:32:24.551 --> 00:32:27.162
And he wanted the fame
of taking on the case.

705
00:32:27.293 --> 00:32:29.730
so he took it on for us
for a very low cost.

706
00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:31.819
and he got us off
of all the charges.

707
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:33.952
And it went over
pretty smoothly in the end.

708
00:32:40.393 --> 00:32:42.786
- You can DM. you can direct
message a celebrity

709
00:32:42.917 --> 00:32:44.658
on their account.

710
00:32:44.788 --> 00:32:47.791
which I think probably
gets people very excited.

711
00:32:47.922 --> 00:32:50.664
- Okay. first comment.

712
00:32:50.794 --> 00:32:52.535
- Comments. comments. comments.

713
00:32:52.666 --> 00:32:55.103
- "Ay!
Hearts. hearts. hearts."

714
00:32:55.234 --> 00:32:58.367
"Wow. Heart. heart. heart."
Lot of hearts.

715
00:32:58.498 --> 00:33:00.717
- My comments are like half
and half: half good. half bad.

716
00:33:00.848 --> 00:33:02.545
Or depending on the posts.
they're all good.

717
00:33:02.676 --> 00:33:04.373
or sometimes they're more
bad ones than good.

718
00:33:04.504 --> 00:33:07.246
- Perfect and sexy.
Thanks for the smile.

719
00:33:07.376 --> 00:33:09.204
Heart eyes. heart eyes.
heart eyes.

720
00:33:09.335 --> 00:33:11.511
- Dewayne Davis 84.

721
00:33:11.641 --> 00:33:14.601
"Clout is the most dangerous
disease out there."

722
00:33:14.731 --> 00:33:17.169
It's true. I mean.
it's true. It's...

723
00:33:17.299 --> 00:33:20.085
He said. "You're a masochist."
What does that mean?

724
00:33:20.215 --> 00:33:22.043
I keep getting those comments.

725
00:33:22.174 --> 00:33:25.394
I think it's someone
that likes pain.

726
00:33:25.525 --> 00:33:27.396
I think that's what that means.
I could be wrong.

727
00:33:27.527 --> 00:33:30.095
I'm not sitting there being
like. "Yeah. this is awesome."

728
00:33:30.225 --> 00:33:33.315
Yeah. no.
I'm definitely not a masochist.

729
00:33:33.446 --> 00:33:34.969
Yeah.

730
00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:39.321
"Kids with semi-well-off
parents. expensive hoodie.

731
00:33:39.452 --> 00:33:42.020
GoPro. martial arts
or gymnastics training.

732
00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:43.760
sense of entitlement.

733
00:33:43.891 --> 00:33:45.849
bored kids
with too much free time.

734
00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.287
and parents that pay
too little attention."

735
00:33:48.417 --> 00:33:50.376
I mean. he's pretty spot
on with all of that.

736
00:33:50.506 --> 00:33:52.987
but what's so bad
about a middle-class kid

737
00:33:53.118 --> 00:33:54.641
doing something he enjoys?

738
00:33:54.771 --> 00:33:56.773
- They're not going to say
bad things.

739
00:33:56.904 --> 00:33:59.124
I don't think
they'll say bad things.

740
00:33:59.254 --> 00:34:01.430
I have a pretty good fan base.
They love me.

741
00:34:01.561 --> 00:34:03.041
- You dumb as shit.

742
00:34:03.171 --> 00:34:04.651
Um...

743
00:34:04.781 --> 00:34:06.435
Yeah.
Straight to the point.

744
00:34:06.566 --> 00:34:08.785
I can't disagree.

745
00:34:08.916 --> 00:34:10.787
- You an inspiration to me.
You feel me?

746
00:34:10.918 --> 00:34:12.615
- I'm an inspiration? How?

747
00:34:12.746 --> 00:34:15.401
How I inspire you?

748
00:34:15.531 --> 00:34:18.317
- You inspire me by doing
crazy shit at grocery stores.

749
00:34:18.447 --> 00:34:21.015
and it just reminds me that
you got me to realize sometimes.

750
00:34:21.146 --> 00:34:22.843
you got to not give a fuck
and do what you got to do.

751
00:34:22.973 --> 00:34:24.932
You feel me?
- I feel you.

752
00:34:25.063 --> 00:34:26.977
That's not the kind of
inspiration I want to be.

753
00:34:27.108 --> 00:34:28.849
but I understand
where you're coming from.

754
00:34:40.948 --> 00:34:42.689
- Oh. damn.
This one hurts.

755
00:34:42.819 --> 00:34:45.735
Spensah said. "Boy from Whitby
suburbs still trying to make it

756
00:34:45.866 --> 00:34:47.476
after 10 years
of failed attempts."

757
00:34:47.607 --> 00:34:50.523
Damn!
Um...

758
00:34:50.653 --> 00:34:53.482
I am from the Whitby
suburbs.

759
00:34:53.613 --> 00:34:55.571
It hasn't been 10 years. man.
Give me a break.

760
00:34:55.702 --> 00:34:57.530
It's been maybe like
half of that.

761
00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:00.359
It hurts because it's like...

762
00:35:00.489 --> 00:35:02.056
It's not one of those ones
where it's like.

763
00:35:02.187 --> 00:35:04.145
"Look at this skinny asshole."

764
00:35:04.276 --> 00:35:06.800
It's ones that
I've personally sat down here.

765
00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:08.802
or like in my car
when I'm driving or something.

766
00:35:08.932 --> 00:35:12.458
that I've thought about.
that kind of gets myself down.

767
00:35:12.588 --> 00:35:14.503
So then it's like
when someone comments it.

768
00:35:14.634 --> 00:35:16.636
like. "Oh. damn. I have thought
about that before."

769
00:35:16.766 --> 00:35:19.378
So it kind of cuts deep.
If I've thought about it.

770
00:35:19.508 --> 00:35:21.293
Damn. that person's thinking
about it too.

771
00:35:21.423 --> 00:35:23.295
So it's like. Damn. it has been
a while.

772
00:35:23.425 --> 00:35:25.340
and I still haven't made it.
type thing.

773
00:35:25.471 --> 00:35:27.516
And then when you see someone
else put it into words.

774
00:35:27.647 --> 00:35:30.302
and it's publicly right there.
it's like. Oh. damn.

775
00:35:31.999 --> 00:35:33.696
You know what. Spensah?

776
00:35:33.827 --> 00:35:35.307
I'm going to remember that.

777
00:35:35.437 --> 00:35:37.352
I'm going to write down
that @name.

778
00:35:37.483 --> 00:35:39.920
and then five years from now. if
I'm still in the exact same spot

779
00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:42.052
that I am sitting
right here today.

780
00:35:42.183 --> 00:35:44.490
then I'll give you that W.

781
00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:47.188
But... for now.
yeah. that one hurt.

782
00:35:47.319 --> 00:35:48.842
Damn.

783
00:35:51.888 --> 00:35:54.761
- Everyone's on their phones
all the time.

784
00:35:54.891 --> 00:35:59.113
and people are getting less
face-to-face time. which is sad.

785
00:35:59.244 --> 00:36:02.160
but it's happening.

786
00:36:03.248 --> 00:36:05.075
How the tipping works
is that

787
00:36:05.206 --> 00:36:08.383
they can tip to send you
a message.

788
00:36:08.514 --> 00:36:10.646
So when they send you a message.

789
00:36:10.777 --> 00:36:12.953
they can request
anything they want.

790
00:36:13.083 --> 00:36:14.737
So they can basically
type like.

791
00:36:14.868 --> 00:36:16.391
"Hey. can I have these videos?"

792
00:36:16.522 --> 00:36:18.001
"Can I have these nudes?"

793
00:36:18.132 --> 00:36:20.047
"Can I have this kind of video?"

794
00:36:20.178 --> 00:36:21.527
"Can I have a JOI video?"

795
00:36:21.657 --> 00:36:24.530
Most often request I get
is JOI videos.

796
00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:26.880
Jerk off instructions.

797
00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:30.579
For some reason I think they
like to hear me talk to them.

798
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:32.233
It's just interesting.

799
00:36:32.364 --> 00:36:35.018
'Cause it's very personalized.

800
00:36:35.149 --> 00:36:37.195
and that's why they buy it.

801
00:36:37.325 --> 00:36:39.284
because it's directed
towards them.

802
00:36:39.414 --> 00:36:42.025
When they tip.
they can have any type of JOI.

803
00:36:42.156 --> 00:36:43.636
They can request.

804
00:36:43.766 --> 00:36:46.595
"Can you call me Daddy
at the end?" Stuff like that.

805
00:36:46.726 --> 00:36:47.988
Right?

806
00:36:48.118 --> 00:36:50.643
So they can make it
their own. like a story.

807
00:36:50.773 --> 00:36:52.732
[chuckles]

808
00:36:54.342 --> 00:36:56.736
[woman]: You're just looking
like that.

809
00:36:59.042 --> 00:37:01.654
- If you like to have Charli
dance to your song.

810
00:37:02.785 --> 00:37:05.745
I think I used to be more
ignorant to all this shit

811
00:37:05.875 --> 00:37:08.138
and the realities of social
media and life.

812
00:37:08.269 --> 00:37:10.967
and then I saw the effects that
it had on Ethan to get canceled.

813
00:37:11.098 --> 00:37:13.883
- My mirror broke. Um...

814
00:37:14.014 --> 00:37:16.103
How's your day going?

815
00:37:16.234 --> 00:37:19.672
- I was 20 when I met him

816
00:37:19.802 --> 00:37:21.717
and he was 16.

817
00:37:21.848 --> 00:37:23.893
I didn't know he was 16
when we met.

818
00:37:24.024 --> 00:37:26.374
because he told me he was 20.
and he lied.

819
00:37:26.505 --> 00:37:28.637
And we became friends before
I ever knew how old he was.

820
00:37:28.768 --> 00:37:31.771
so then I had to not care.
I felt really close to him

821
00:37:31.901 --> 00:37:33.816
because he understood me
and I understood him.

822
00:37:33.947 --> 00:37:35.905
And we both were working
social media.

823
00:37:36.036 --> 00:37:37.951
so we were very much helping
each other a lot with that.

824
00:37:38.081 --> 00:37:40.823
And then just losing that
was really hard.

825
00:37:40.954 --> 00:37:43.826
because it was just like losing
someone that was my partner.

826
00:37:43.957 --> 00:37:46.046
- Everyone's been trying
the giant straw challenge.

827
00:37:46.176 --> 00:37:47.482
so I'm going to try it.

828
00:37:47.613 --> 00:37:49.267
- His internet career started
falling apart

829
00:37:49.397 --> 00:37:51.269
'cause he made
some dumb decisions...

830
00:37:51.399 --> 00:37:52.400
[retches]

831
00:37:52.531 --> 00:37:54.272
...but that made him die.

832
00:37:57.405 --> 00:38:00.365
- I am Deanne Krusensterna.

833
00:38:00.495 --> 00:38:04.282
I am the mother of Ethan Peters.

834
00:38:04.412 --> 00:38:06.371
Ethan is supreme.

835
00:38:07.981 --> 00:38:10.070
Ethan will always be the
outrageous one of the group.

836
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.463
- Mwah!

837
00:38:11.593 --> 00:38:13.116
He is the one who is going
to say.

838
00:38:13.247 --> 00:38:16.119
"Hey. I'm here. Pay attention."

839
00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:21.037
He made well over six figures
right before COVID hit.

840
00:38:21.168 --> 00:38:26.347
But then he did a video
on TikTok.

841
00:38:26.478 --> 00:38:29.263
and there was a woman that
was taking her kids to Disney

842
00:38:29.394 --> 00:38:30.917
every single day.

843
00:38:31.047 --> 00:38:32.875
and he made a funny video

844
00:38:33.006 --> 00:38:34.921
about calling child
protective services.

845
00:38:35.051 --> 00:38:36.618
'cause that would be
a horrible thing.

846
00:38:36.749 --> 00:38:38.533
We are not Disney
kind of people.

847
00:38:38.664 --> 00:38:40.274
We'd rather go
to a rock festival.

848
00:38:40.405 --> 00:38:43.016
or anything
but hang out at Disney.

849
00:38:44.234 --> 00:38:46.759
- And we said. what if
your kids something else?

850
00:38:46.889 --> 00:38:48.804
What if they like Marvel
and stuff like that?

851
00:38:48.935 --> 00:38:51.067
And we were just making a joke.
Just 'cause you love Disney.

852
00:38:51.198 --> 00:38:52.765
what if your kids
don't love Disney?

853
00:38:52.895 --> 00:38:54.288
- They attacked.

854
00:38:54.419 --> 00:38:58.074
They decided that
he was making fun

855
00:38:58.205 --> 00:39:01.208
of this woman's children.
which he wasn't.

856
00:39:01.339 --> 00:39:04.646
They went after brands.
contacting brands.

857
00:39:04.777 --> 00:39:07.954
telling brands that
this is a horrible person.

858
00:39:08.084 --> 00:39:09.738
you shouldn't be using
this person.

859
00:39:09.869 --> 00:39:12.741
And brands started dropping him.

860
00:39:12.872 --> 00:39:14.961
- He lost all of his brand deals
and endorsements.

861
00:39:15.091 --> 00:39:18.399
loses followers. loses so much.

862
00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:20.270
And it really was.

863
00:39:20.401 --> 00:39:22.708
that's what sent him
over the edge. losing so much.

864
00:39:25.101 --> 00:39:27.495
- Instead of just saying.
you know what?

865
00:39:27.626 --> 00:39:29.236
I don't like this person.
I don't like their content.

866
00:39:29.367 --> 00:39:31.456
I'm not going to watch them.

867
00:39:31.586 --> 00:39:36.635
they find this need
to destroy them.

868

[alarm beeping loudly]

869
00:39:42.249 --> 00:39:44.469
- You know what?
I helped him make that TikTok.

870
00:39:44.599 --> 00:39:46.035
I don't really feel guilt
about that

871
00:39:46.166 --> 00:39:48.211
because Ethan did nothing wrong
in that TikTok.

872
00:39:48.342 --> 00:39:49.778
Nothing wrong at all.

873
00:39:49.909 --> 00:39:52.041
The internet decided to make him
think it was wrong.

874
00:39:52.172 --> 00:39:55.436
That's their fault.
Here's the thing:

875
00:39:55.567 --> 00:39:59.005
I will never think it wasn't
part of my fault that he's dead.

876
00:39:59.135 --> 00:40:00.876
I've gone through
our text messages

877
00:40:01.007 --> 00:40:03.009
and I've gone through our DMs.
and there'd be points

878
00:40:03.139 --> 00:40:05.011
where he'd be posting
about his life. and I'd be like.

879
00:40:05.141 --> 00:40:09.319
Go get a fucking Xanax.
I will never ever. ever say

880
00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:13.411
I'm not a part of the reason
that 17-year-old kid's dead.

881
00:40:27.816 --> 00:40:30.515
- She didn't have to use
the platform like that.

882
00:40:30.645 --> 00:40:32.342
You know what?

883
00:40:32.473 --> 00:40:35.520
She could have simply sent him
a message and said.

884
00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:37.435
"Hey. I was quite offended
by your video.

885
00:40:37.565 --> 00:40:40.481
But that video hurt my feelings

886
00:40:40.612 --> 00:40:43.136
and I would really be sad if my
kids grew up and saw it one day.

887
00:40:43.266 --> 00:40:44.964
Could you please take it down?"

888
00:40:45.094 --> 00:40:47.053
I guarantee Ethan probably
would've taken it down.

889
00:40:47.183 --> 00:40:49.882
They're still commenting on
his Instagrams every single day.

bullying a post of a dead child.

891
00:40:53.668 --> 00:40:56.628
- Another one.
"Bitch."

892
00:40:56.758 --> 00:40:59.718
She says. "This is what happens
when you let your son be gay.

893
00:40:59.848 --> 00:41:03.069
If you slapped the shit out of
him when he came out of you.

894
00:41:03.199 --> 00:41:04.984
then maybe this wouldn't have
happened."

895
00:41:05.114 --> 00:41:06.942
You're only on my account

896
00:41:07.073 --> 00:41:10.598
because you wanted
to leave this message.

897
00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:15.081
It's just absolutely insane.

898
00:41:15.211 --> 00:41:17.257
Who does that?

899
00:41:17.387 --> 00:41:20.042
- You have to be. That was a kid
making mistake 'cause he was 17.

900
00:41:20.173 --> 00:41:22.523
And you have to think about.
What did I do when I was 17?

901
00:41:22.654 --> 00:41:24.438
How did I act when I was 17?

902
00:41:24.569 --> 00:41:26.222
What are the mistakes
I've made in life?

903
00:41:26.353 --> 00:41:28.355
You have a privilege that
you didn't do that on camera.

904
00:41:28.486 --> 00:41:30.052
It's a fucking privilege.

905
00:41:30.183 --> 00:41:31.663
There's things that
I said on the internet.

906
00:41:31.793 --> 00:41:33.839
like. I'll look back on videos
I made on 2019

907
00:41:33.969 --> 00:41:39.105
and my Instagram archive.
and I'm like. yikes!

908
00:41:39.235 --> 00:41:42.282
I would never do that at 23
because I grew the fuck up.

spent 10 years...

913
00:42:18.144 --> 00:42:20.102
I didn't have no love
for it.

914
00:42:20.233 --> 00:42:21.669
I didn't have any passion.

915
00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:24.324
I didn't have that motivation
to get up every day

916
00:42:24.454 --> 00:42:26.326
and do this and do that.

917
00:42:29.938 --> 00:42:32.201
If I wasn't a content creator.

918
00:42:32.332 --> 00:42:34.987
I honestly think
I'd be in a lot of trouble.

919
00:42:35.117 --> 00:42:39.252
The chances of me committing.
like. real crimes...

920
00:42:40.949 --> 00:42:43.561
Probably would be a criminal.
like a real criminal.

921
00:42:43.691 --> 00:42:46.041
unfortunately.

922
00:42:46.172 --> 00:42:48.957
I don't know what I would do.
That's the problem.

923
00:42:49.088 --> 00:42:51.264
So I decided if I'm going
to go to jail.

924
00:42:51.394 --> 00:42:53.222
I'm going to go to jail
for these videos.

925
00:42:58.184 --> 00:43:00.447
I had one bad day at work.

926
00:43:01.927 --> 00:43:05.408
I look at the customers. they're
all the way to the door.

927
00:43:05.539 --> 00:43:08.586
things weren't moving the way I
wanted to. It was an impulse.

and I want it now.

929
00:43:11.632 --> 00:43:14.548

it's a lot of tolerance.

is temporary. bro. deadass.

I don't want to do this.

to be doing none of this.

And I don't know what else
to do. You feel me?

biggest fans. I guess.

00:44:26.751 --> 00:44:28.927
My yearbook quote:

954
00:44:29.057 --> 00:44:31.930
"I understand
the consequences of my actions.

955
00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:34.323
but I also understand
the benefits."

956
00:44:34.454 --> 00:44:36.325
It's a Jumanne quote.

957
00:44:36.456 --> 00:44:40.503
and it plays into
his entire YouTube persona.

958
00:44:40.634 --> 00:44:43.071
- Yeah. one day I'm going
to be a millionaire.

959
00:44:43.202 --> 00:44:45.291
All this is temporary.

Subway video he released...

so freaking much.

That video. when it blew up.
got over a million views.

965

Even my friends
got a hold of the video.

970
00:45:17.105 --> 00:45:21.544
And also. it made it
onto the local news as well.

971
00:45:21.675 --> 00:45:26.636
The Subway one really hit
the media for real. though.

972
00:45:26.767 --> 00:45:29.770
When he did that stuff.
he knew what he signed up for.

973
00:45:29.901 --> 00:45:32.120
I know he's doing it
for a reason.

974
00:45:32.251 --> 00:45:35.384
I know he's not just doing it
for clout. Right?

975
00:45:35.515 --> 00:45:37.473
I mean he is.

976
00:45:37.604 --> 00:45:40.259
but I don't think he's a bad
person when he does that stuff.

977
00:45:40.389 --> 00:45:43.001
He clearly knows it's wrong.

978
00:45:43.131 --> 00:45:45.699
And even though it's wrong.

979
00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:49.268
it's just there to get
the attention that he needs.

[neon buzzing lightly]

981
00:46:03.325 --> 00:46:05.545
- At the beginning
of when Jake started this.

982
00:46:05.675 --> 00:46:08.940
I don't think I understood
what the platform was

983
00:46:09.070 --> 00:46:10.811
or what it was intended for.

984
00:46:10.942 --> 00:46:12.160
All I understood was that
my son

985
00:46:12.291 --> 00:46:13.771
was making
some poor decisions

986
00:46:13.901 --> 00:46:15.381
and putting himself
in harm's way

987
00:46:15.511 --> 00:46:18.906
for laughter
or for comedic value.

988
00:46:19.037 --> 00:46:21.039
And as Jake was going
through high school

989
00:46:21.169 --> 00:46:22.997
and finishing up high school.

990
00:46:23.128 --> 00:46:25.086
and you hear about other
parents and their kids.

991
00:46:25.217 --> 00:46:27.785
and they're going off
to college or university.

992
00:46:27.915 --> 00:46:29.525
and my son's an influencer.

993
00:46:29.656 --> 00:46:31.527
I was like. I don't even
know what that means.

Are you going to go to school?

996
00:46:35.227 --> 00:46:37.403
So it's just a world
that I never knew.

997
00:46:37.533 --> 00:46:39.579
and I'm not even sure
that I could say

998
00:46:39.709 --> 00:46:41.276
I completely
understand it still.

999
00:46:41.407 --> 00:46:42.930
- I quit.

1000
00:46:43.061 --> 00:46:45.498
- I remember at a burger joint

1001
00:46:45.628 --> 00:46:47.761
was a young boy.

1002
00:46:47.892 --> 00:46:49.415
and he's just trying to...

1003
00:46:49.545 --> 00:46:51.809
You know. he's trying
to get Jake's attention.

1004
00:46:51.939 --> 00:46:53.854
And he's identified.
he knows who he is.

1005
00:46:53.985 --> 00:46:55.638
and he's trying to get
his attention.

1006
00:46:55.769 --> 00:46:57.379
and he wanted to take a picture
with Jake.

1007
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:59.729
Well. those are kind of like
smile moments for me

1008
00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:02.428
where... may not understand.

1009
00:47:02.558 --> 00:47:04.909
but those are the fun times.

1010
00:47:11.002 --> 00:47:13.047
- Having Ava as a daughter

1011
00:47:13.178 --> 00:47:17.138
has been very challenging.
to say the least.

1012
00:47:17.269 --> 00:47:20.228
I mean. the stunts she pulls
and all this stuff.

1013
00:47:20.359 --> 00:47:22.100
but I do have
to give her credit.

1014
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:26.452
The fact that she's...
worldwide news so many times.

1015
00:47:26.582 --> 00:47:29.890
and enough money to
be starting a 401k.

1016
00:47:30.021 --> 00:47:32.501
is very impressive
at your age.

1017
00:47:32.632 --> 00:47:34.677
And so...
Not that I like what she's...

1018
00:47:34.808 --> 00:47:37.071
I'd rather have her get married
to some guy.

1019
00:47:37.202 --> 00:47:38.638
- I don't want to do that.

1020
00:47:38.768 --> 00:47:40.901
Listen to this DM I got
from some guy:

1021
00:47:41.032 --> 00:47:43.469
"Just had a drink
with your dad in Manhattan.

1022
00:47:43.599 --> 00:47:46.080
He's so proud of you
and showed me your page.

1023
00:47:46.211 --> 00:47:47.995
Would love to connect."

1024
00:47:48.126 --> 00:47:49.910
Obviously
this creepy old man...

1025
00:47:50.041 --> 00:47:51.869
- But you didn't...
He's a plastic surgeon.

1026
00:47:51.999 --> 00:47:53.392
He's offering you
free plastic surgery.

1027
00:47:58.397 --> 00:48:00.660
- I never thought
about the fame.

1028
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:02.967
I mean. you would talk about.

1029
00:48:03.097 --> 00:48:06.405
"Oh wow. this clip got
so many likes. or whatever."

1030
00:48:06.535 --> 00:48:08.102
- Mm-hmm.

1031
00:48:08.233 --> 00:48:12.193
It never fazed me that
I would equate that with fame.

1032
00:48:12.324 --> 00:48:15.240
- Nowhere near where I want
to be in the social media.

1033
00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:17.764
I just want to keep building
followers and a fan base.

1034
00:48:17.895 --> 00:48:19.374
- See. and I'm oblivious
to all that.

1035
00:48:19.505 --> 00:48:21.202
- I never thought
that it would actually...

1036
00:48:21.333 --> 00:48:22.987
ever get to be this big.

1037
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.773
[yelping]

1038
00:48:27.905 --> 00:48:29.602
- Look at her on her pony
at the horse show.

1039
00:48:29.732 --> 00:48:31.909
She won a ribbon. Right?
She had a really nice life.

1040
00:48:32.039 --> 00:48:33.562
She just didn't like
how she looked.

1041
00:48:33.693 --> 00:48:35.347
You notice it.
- Yeah. 'cause she bullied me.

1042
00:48:35.477 --> 00:48:37.218
- I did.

1043
00:48:37.349 --> 00:48:39.829
I bullied her 'cause
I didn't want her to get fat.

1044
00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:41.440
She wouldn't stop eating out.

1045
00:48:41.570 --> 00:48:43.398
- So I got an eating disorder
and threw up everywhere.

1046
00:48:43.529 --> 00:48:45.357
She used to go on a bikini
on her trampoline

1047
00:48:45.487 --> 00:48:47.707
and bounce on the trampoline
in a bikini

1048
00:48:47.837 --> 00:48:49.361
to make all the moms upset.

1049
00:48:49.491 --> 00:48:52.668
And the kids would come home
on the bus from school.

1050
00:48:52.799 --> 00:48:55.280
and then we would all see my
mother in a bikini. bouncing.

1051
00:48:55.410 --> 00:48:57.064
- Guilty.

1052
00:48:57.195 --> 00:49:00.154
- And she wonders
why I have an OnlyFans.

1053
00:49:02.765 --> 00:49:04.550
- It's been tough at times

1054
00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:06.421
watching certain stunts
or activities

1055
00:49:06.552 --> 00:49:08.815
that my son has done that he
would put himself in harm's way.

1056
00:49:08.946 --> 00:49:11.600
And as a mom. you want
your children safe.

1057
00:49:11.731 --> 00:49:14.081
And to see him
cause himself harm...

1058
00:49:14.212 --> 00:49:15.909
Because I think at that age.

1059
00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:17.780
you don't think anything's
ever going to happen.

1060
00:49:17.911 --> 00:49:19.521
You assume that all
will be well.

1061
00:49:19.652 --> 00:49:21.349
or always going to recover.

1062
00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:23.351
And as a parent. you always
look at. "What if it doesn't?"

1063
00:49:23.482 --> 00:49:24.831
What if that one time...?

1064
00:49:24.962 --> 00:49:26.267
- Okay. Go again.
Let's go again.

1065
00:49:26.398 --> 00:49:28.356
Ready?
We're going to go.

1066
00:49:28.487 --> 00:49:30.315
- So I definitely had
some strains for sure.

1067
00:49:30.445 --> 00:49:33.187
And you try to be understanding
and tolerant

1068
00:49:33.318 --> 00:49:36.582
but still provide the direction
and guidance

1069
00:49:36.712 --> 00:49:39.585
as to what they're doing
might not be viewed as favorably

1070
00:49:39.715 --> 00:49:41.108
in the general public.

1071
00:49:41.239 --> 00:49:44.024
But it's been...

1072
00:49:44.155 --> 00:49:46.592
it has been challenging
throughout some of the years.

1073
00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:54.817
- I don't like the
rooftopping at all.

1074
00:49:54.948 --> 00:49:56.863
- Which is fair.
- We've had fights.

1075
00:49:56.994 --> 00:49:58.473
I've yelled and I've...

1076
00:49:58.604 --> 00:50:01.172
"You're not doing this!"
Well. I'm not going to...

1077
00:50:01.302 --> 00:50:03.609
- I'm 22 years old.
- ...ground a 22-year-old guy!

1078
00:50:03.739 --> 00:50:06.090
What am I going to do?
You know...

1079
00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:08.744
And then he would say.
Well. I wouldn't do it

1080
00:50:08.875 --> 00:50:11.095
if I wasn't comfortable
doing it.

1081
00:50:11.225 --> 00:50:13.836
I wouldn't do it if I knew
I was going to get hurt.

1082
00:50:13.967 --> 00:50:16.622
I wouldn't do it
if I knew I couldn't do it.

1083
00:50:16.752 --> 00:50:18.537
And I said.
Well. accidents happen.

1084
00:50:18.667 --> 00:50:21.540
And I pray a lot for him.

1085
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:23.411
A really lot.

1086
00:50:39.036 --> 00:50:40.472
So I have blonde hair now.

1087
00:50:41.951 --> 00:50:43.910
I've got a nice mustache
going on.

1088
00:50:44.041 --> 00:50:45.955
The new Jackass movie
just came out.

1089
00:50:47.174 --> 00:50:48.697
They took
one of my bits. I think.

1090
00:50:48.828 --> 00:50:51.135
What are you going to do?
It's the internet.

1091
00:50:51.265 --> 00:50:54.573
I can't trademark a video.

1092
00:50:54.703 --> 00:50:57.315
I can't trademark the mime.
You know?

1093
00:50:57.445 --> 00:50:59.621
People have been doing it
since. I don't know. 1920s.

1094
00:50:59.752 --> 00:51:01.449
[yelling]

1095
00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:04.496
Yeah. it sucks.
But it is what it is.

1096
00:51:04.626 --> 00:51:06.889
Steve-O's been an inspiration.

1097
00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:08.108
I've mentioned that many times.

1098
00:51:08.239 --> 00:51:10.328
that Steve-O is kind
of the reason

1099
00:51:10.458 --> 00:51:12.156
why I got into doing stunts
and stuff.

1100
00:51:12.286 --> 00:51:14.114
And yeah. with the whole
mime bit.

1101
00:51:14.245 --> 00:51:18.118
it was a clearcut ripoff
to the tee.

1102
00:51:18.249 --> 00:51:20.338
even with the skateboard
hitting the shin.

1103
00:51:20.468 --> 00:51:22.166
Would've been nice
to get the invite.

1104
00:51:22.296 --> 00:51:24.342
It would've been cool to get
a little bit of credit in there.

1105
00:51:24.472 --> 00:51:26.561
But what are you going to do?

1106
00:51:29.173 --> 00:51:30.652
Good shot.

1107
00:51:32.828 --> 00:51:34.482
The butter is
on the top. dude.

1108
00:51:34.613 --> 00:51:36.223
Fucking ridiculous.

1109
00:51:38.312 --> 00:51:40.706
"Do not attempt any of the
stunts you're about to see."

1110
00:51:40.836 --> 00:51:43.056
If only a whole generation
listened to that. bro.

1111
00:51:43.187 --> 00:51:44.884
Legit. man.

1112
00:51:50.803 --> 00:51:52.152
[laughing]

1113
00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:54.415
Yo!

1114
00:51:54.546 --> 00:51:55.634
Dude. he just...

1115
00:51:55.764 --> 00:51:57.897
Yo. what the fuck?

1116
00:51:58.854 --> 00:52:00.378
Wow.

1117
00:52:01.857 --> 00:52:03.294
[onscreen]:
This is the quiet game.

1118
00:52:03.424 --> 00:52:05.948
- Okay. Here's my live reaction

1119
00:52:06.079 --> 00:52:07.820
to seeing Jackass
take the mime idea.

1120
00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:09.387
[onscreen]: Are you ready?

1121
00:52:09.517 --> 00:52:11.432
[yelling onscreen]
- Oh. my God. dude.

1122
00:52:11.563 --> 00:52:14.087
- So confidence is...

1123
00:52:14.218 --> 00:52:16.394
- Yeah. they fully
kind of took it. but...

1124
00:52:21.399 --> 00:52:24.358
[ethereal music]

1125
00:52:32.236 --> 00:52:34.890
It's kind of like
a fresh start a little bit.

1126
00:52:35.021 --> 00:52:37.719
So that's how I'm going
to try and look at it.

1127
00:52:37.850 --> 00:52:39.286
And I don't know.

1128
00:52:39.417 --> 00:52:41.506
I think it's time to retire
the whole mime thing.

1129
00:52:41.636 --> 00:52:43.769
I want to be known
as Jake Hillhouse too;

1130
00:52:43.899 --> 00:52:46.250
I don't want to be known as the
guy that puts on mime makeup

1131
00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:48.991
and fucks himself up.
You know?

1132
00:52:49.122 --> 00:52:51.994
I mean. Steve-O made a noise.
and I never made a noise.

1133
00:52:52.125 --> 00:52:54.301
So I got him on that.

1134
00:53:05.007 --> 00:53:06.270
- Where should we start?

1135
00:53:07.749 --> 00:53:11.188
This... this is my gold
Chanel bag.

1136
00:53:11.318 --> 00:53:13.842
It's covered in flies.

1137
00:53:14.713 --> 00:53:16.454
because though
I am an influencer.

1138
00:53:16.584 --> 00:53:19.935
I live like the dirty
ratchet Jersey bitch I am.

1139
00:53:20.066 --> 00:53:23.591
This bag was $6.000.

1140
00:53:23.722 --> 00:53:25.550
People look at it
and they're like. Oh. my God.

1141
00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:27.813
that's the most gorgeous
Chanel bag I've ever seen.

1142
00:53:27.943 --> 00:53:29.206
And it's just special
and different.

1143
00:53:29.336 --> 00:53:30.859
I only buy bags
that are special.

1144
00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:32.861
This is my latest purchase.

1145
00:53:32.992 --> 00:53:35.342
I thought the color
was quite pretty.

1146
00:53:35.473 --> 00:53:38.476
This is how I would imagine
unicorn semen would look

1147
00:53:38.606 --> 00:53:41.130
if a unicorn ejaculated
onto a purse.

1148
00:53:41.261 --> 00:53:42.784
This is kind of the vibe I got.

1149
00:53:42.915 --> 00:53:44.656
This is the real prize.

1150
00:53:44.786 --> 00:53:46.223
Little dirty.

1151
00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:50.879
This one was like 7.000.

1152
00:53:51.010 --> 00:53:54.405
This one was 4.000.
which is cheaper for my bags.

1153
00:53:54.535 --> 00:53:55.884
I just started collecting them.

1154
00:53:56.015 --> 00:53:57.799
I got a designer purse
addiction.

1155
00:53:57.930 --> 00:53:59.801
And I got addicted
to the fucking bags.

1156
00:53:59.932 --> 00:54:01.673
And I didn't even carry them.

1157
00:54:01.803 --> 00:54:03.631
I would just go to the store
and see one that was cute.

1158
00:54:03.762 --> 00:54:05.242
and I could afford it.
so I bought it.

1159
00:54:05.372 --> 00:54:06.765
Then I realized
at the end of the year.

1160
00:54:06.895 --> 00:54:10.247
I was just like.
I spent at least $150.000

1161
00:54:10.377 --> 00:54:12.771
on purses that
I don't even carry.

1162
00:54:12.901 --> 00:54:17.036
Oh. no. It appears
the cats have chewed it.

1163
00:54:17.166 --> 00:54:18.559
Oh. no.

1164
00:54:18.690 --> 00:54:20.344
My cats chewed on this.

1165
00:54:20.474 --> 00:54:22.041
That sucks.

1166
00:54:22.911 --> 00:54:24.478
Oh. well.

1167
00:54:24.609 --> 00:54:26.915
Guess it's staying with me
and not ever being sold.

1168
00:54:27.046 --> 00:54:28.656
[coughs]

1169
00:54:28.787 --> 00:54:30.310
Not that I would want
to sell this one anyway.

1170
00:54:30.441 --> 00:54:33.835
I got rich way too fast.

1171
00:54:33.966 --> 00:54:35.924
I made a very immature decision.

1172
00:54:36.055 --> 00:54:38.057
So if you get really rich
off the internet.

1173
00:54:38.187 --> 00:54:40.407
save it
and don't buy dumb shit.

1174
00:54:40.538 --> 00:54:44.281
'Cause it's like when you give a
21-year-old six figures a year.

1175
00:54:44.411 --> 00:54:46.370
and obviously she's going
to blow it on Chanel bags.

1176
00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:49.068
Now I'm getting older
and realizing

1177
00:54:49.198 --> 00:54:52.071
I should invest my money
on myself and my ass.

1178
00:54:52.201 --> 00:54:54.334
It's an investment.

1179
00:55:10.959 --> 00:55:13.222
[clanging]

1180
00:55:17.052 --> 00:55:19.141
- Um. I could...

1181
00:55:19.272 --> 00:55:21.753
The amount of money
that I've made over time

1182
00:55:21.883 --> 00:55:24.277
from my content.

1183
00:55:24.408 --> 00:55:26.540
I probably made
a little bit more than $500.

1184
00:55:26.671 --> 00:55:29.413
But that's over two years maybe.

1185
00:55:29.543 --> 00:55:33.068
I didn't make anything
that was worth it financially.

1186
00:55:33.199 --> 00:55:36.768
I've made money.
but it wasn't worth it.

1187
00:55:43.078 --> 00:55:46.299
- I think a lot of what's
driving influencer culture

1188
00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:52.392
is the dream or allure that
you might be able to make it

1189
00:55:52.523 --> 00:55:54.655
and that it might be lucrative.

1190
00:55:54.786 --> 00:55:56.788
and you could be the one
that goes viral.

1191
00:55:56.918 --> 00:56:01.314
So that's what's making
the content get pushed out.

1192
00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:10.192
- Statistically. to be
a super famous. I'm talking

1193
00:56:10.323 --> 00:56:13.631
top-end. super famous
internet celebrity YouTuber.

1194
00:56:13.761 --> 00:56:16.111
your odds are extremely low.

1195
00:56:16.242 --> 00:56:19.680
There are over 3.000 channels
making six figures a year

1196
00:56:19.811 --> 00:56:21.203
on YouTube:

1197
00:56:21.334 --> 00:56:23.249
underneath one tenth
of one tenth of 1%.

1198
00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:24.468
Not good.

1199
00:56:24.598 --> 00:56:25.991
Your odds.

1200
00:56:26.121 --> 00:56:27.819
your current odds.

1201
00:56:27.949 --> 00:56:31.562
are easier to get drafted
onto a professional sports team

1202
00:56:31.692 --> 00:56:33.346
and go to Harvard

1203
00:56:33.477 --> 00:56:35.304
and then get drafted
onto another sports team

1204
00:56:35.435 --> 00:56:38.046
is easier than becoming
a super famous YouTuber.

1205
00:56:38.177 --> 00:56:41.833
So it is statistically
difficult

1206
00:56:41.963 --> 00:56:44.575
to become super famous.

1207
00:56:44.705 --> 00:56:47.360
That being said.
anyone can do it.

1208
00:56:53.975 --> 00:56:55.890
- Anybody want to join the live?

1209
00:56:58.066 --> 00:57:00.939
Damn. Terrence ain't pop up
or Teddy. This is crazy.

1210
00:57:01.069 --> 00:57:04.290
They're not even here. bro.
at all.

1211
00:57:05.291 --> 00:57:07.467
Um...

1212
00:57:09.382 --> 00:57:11.340
Yeah. I mean. it is what it is.

1213
00:57:11.471 --> 00:57:13.299
You know what I'm saying?
So...

1214
00:57:18.739 --> 00:57:21.089
Might of have had
a couple viral videos.

1215
00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:23.178
but that doesn't mean nothing.
I didn't make any real...

1216
00:57:23.309 --> 00:57:25.746
I didn't make almost any money
off those videos.

1217
00:57:25.877 --> 00:57:29.141
so regardless
on how many millions of views

1218
00:57:29.271 --> 00:57:32.884
that my videos generated.
it hasn't done anything for me.

1219
00:57:33.014 --> 00:57:36.191
My reality is I have
a bad reputation locally.

1220
00:57:36.322 --> 00:57:39.064
The people that are coming
to my profiles

1221
00:57:39.194 --> 00:57:40.587
and sending me messages.

1222
00:57:40.718 --> 00:57:42.502
but they're coming out
of the controversy.

1223
00:57:42.633 --> 00:57:43.982
so they're coming through hate.

1224
00:57:44.112 --> 00:57:46.201
They're angry
and they want to criticize.

1225
00:57:46.332 --> 00:57:48.160
And that's really it. it is.

1226
00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:51.119
And everything I did is like
a circus. I was a clown.

1227
00:57:51.250 --> 00:57:53.644
And if I'm going to be a clown.
I have to be a clown.

1228
00:57:53.774 --> 00:57:55.428
I can't just take off
the clown suit

1229
00:57:55.559 --> 00:57:56.821
and put on a business suit

1230
00:57:56.951 --> 00:57:58.866
and think people are going
to stay for the show.

1231
00:57:58.997 --> 00:58:00.738
They're not.
They came to see a clown.

1232
00:58:00.868 --> 00:58:02.130
That's what they came
to the circus for.

1233
00:58:02.261 --> 00:58:03.958
They want to see the act.

1234
00:58:08.659 --> 00:58:12.576
"What's a message you hope
to express most in your story?"

1235
00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:19.887
I don't know.

1236
00:58:20.018 --> 00:58:21.759
Just a person trying
to find himself.

1237
00:58:21.889 --> 00:58:23.804
I don't know.
I don't know.

1238
00:58:23.935 --> 00:58:25.763
I'm just a regular person. bro.
Just a human being.

1239
00:58:42.649 --> 00:58:44.869
- My TikTok has been deleted.
which sucks.

1240
00:58:44.999 --> 00:58:46.566
Tried appealing it.

1241
00:58:46.697 --> 00:58:48.220
Doesn't look like
it's happening.

1242
00:58:48.350 --> 00:58:50.309
They have the ability
to just take you down.

1243
00:58:50.439 --> 00:58:52.920
[yelling]
Pry it open.

1244
00:58:53.051 --> 00:58:55.096
Ow. fuck!

1245
00:58:55.227 --> 00:58:58.578
Yeah. I think I was taken down
for self-harm. which.

1246
00:58:58.709 --> 00:59:00.537
you know. it kind of makes
sense. it kind of doesn't.

1247
00:59:00.667 --> 00:59:02.147
I don't know.
It just sucks

1248
00:59:02.277 --> 00:59:05.890
'cause that was a big form
of numbers

1249
00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:08.327
to push towards my YouTube
and push towards my Instagram.

1250
00:59:08.457 --> 00:59:09.981
So yeah. it sucks.

1251
00:59:10.111 --> 00:59:13.114
I didn't make a single dollar.
at least not from TikTok.

1252
00:59:13.245 --> 00:59:14.812
I didn't make a single dollar.

1253
00:59:14.942 --> 00:59:18.859
So to dumb it down for you.

1254
00:59:18.990 --> 00:59:20.731
I don't know what's next.
but I do know

1255
00:59:20.861 --> 00:59:23.777
that I do want to reshape it so
that I can do this for a living.

1256
00:59:23.908 --> 00:59:27.694
Because right now I'm not
doing it for a living.

1257
00:59:27.825 --> 00:59:30.088
'cause I don't make anything
from it really.

1258
00:59:39.706 --> 00:59:42.535
- I forever am going
to be looked at

1259
00:59:42.666 --> 00:59:44.972
as the girl who licked a toilet
seat. but who cares?

1260
00:59:45.103 --> 00:59:47.888
If I licked a toilet seat
and I was really ugly.

1261
00:59:48.019 --> 00:59:52.501
I would not have gone
as explosive as it did.

1262
00:59:52.632 --> 00:59:55.287
But there was some sex appeal
in me licking that toilet seat.

1263
00:59:55.417 --> 00:59:57.289
You know what I'm saying?

1264
00:59:57.419 --> 01:00:00.074
And it's like. if I was an ugly
girl licking a toilet seat.

1265
01:00:00.205 --> 01:00:02.599
it wouldn't have done
as the numbers did.

1266
01:00:02.729 --> 01:00:05.471
But I think especially
what I do for a living.

1267
01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:09.518
sex just really sells.

1268
01:00:09.649 --> 01:00:13.348
You cannot be a woman
who has zero talent.

1269
01:00:13.479 --> 01:00:15.133
Like. I don't have talent.

1270
01:00:15.263 --> 01:00:18.571
My talent is manipulating
the media and blowing up online.

1271
01:00:18.702 --> 01:00:19.616
I would say that's talent.

1272
01:00:19.746 --> 01:00:21.530
But besides that.

1273
01:00:21.661 --> 01:00:23.271
we live in a society
where we're seen as objects.

1274
01:00:23.402 --> 01:00:24.838
We just are.

1275
01:00:24.969 --> 01:00:26.840
And a lot of people
don't want to admit it.

1276
01:00:26.971 --> 01:00:28.799
There are women
who don't want to appeal

1277
01:00:28.929 --> 01:00:31.192
to the male gaze and they go
very against the grain.

1278
01:00:31.323 --> 01:00:33.368
And good for them for that.
But I'm not going to do that

1279
01:00:33.499 --> 01:00:35.806
because I see the advantage
of taking over the male gaze.

1280
01:00:35.936 --> 01:00:37.416
And if men just want
to have sex with me

1281
01:00:37.546 --> 01:00:38.896
and see me as a sex object.

1282
01:00:39.026 --> 01:00:41.028
'cause it's what was happening
to me for years

1283
01:00:41.159 --> 01:00:43.161
and happening to every girl
I've ever known.

1284
01:00:43.291 --> 01:00:45.293
I was just like. Well.
let's just make money off of it.

1285
01:00:45.424 --> 01:00:46.947
Just in general.

1286
01:00:47.078 --> 01:00:48.645
there are girls
who don't have OnlyFans

1287
01:00:48.775 --> 01:00:50.647
who are getting used by men.

1288
01:00:50.777 --> 01:00:53.171
At least
I make money off of it.

1289
01:00:53.301 --> 01:00:55.608
'cause you could not be
a little sexy internet girl.

1290
01:00:55.739 --> 01:00:57.349
but then you'll have to go work
a nine-to-five.

1291
01:00:57.479 --> 01:00:59.786
or you'll probably be
sexually harassed at your job.

1292
01:01:08.099 --> 01:01:09.927
- We need to be tuned in.

1293
01:01:10.057 --> 01:01:12.451
We can't passively interact the
way that television allows us

1294
01:01:12.581 --> 01:01:13.974
to sit back and consume.

1295
01:01:14.105 --> 01:01:16.020
And we need to remember

1296
01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:18.196
that we are actually
in charge of the platform.

1297
01:01:18.326 --> 01:01:20.111
It isn't the platform
in charge of us.

1298
01:01:20.241 --> 01:01:22.896
- One of the reasons the TikTok
algorithm is so powerful

1299
01:01:23.027 --> 01:01:25.072
is it's based on something
called dwell time

1300
01:01:25.203 --> 01:01:27.509
and actually
what you're watching.

1301
01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:30.643
So it's not as much
what you like or share;

1302
01:01:30.774 --> 01:01:32.340
it's what you're actually
watching.

1303
01:01:32.471 --> 01:01:34.995
which is a much better indicator
of what you as a consumer

1304
01:01:35.126 --> 01:01:36.910
are interested in.

1305
01:01:37.041 --> 01:01:39.696
So as much as consumers
might say they don't want drama.

1306
01:01:39.826 --> 01:01:41.523
they don't want a certain
type of content.

1307
01:01:41.654 --> 01:01:44.875
it actually is sort of a mirror
back to ourselves

1308
01:01:45.005 --> 01:01:47.442
because we're the ones that
are liking. commenting.

1309
01:01:47.573 --> 01:01:50.010
sharing. and engaging
with that content.

1310
01:01:51.316 --> 01:01:53.144
- Yeah.

1311
01:01:54.972 --> 01:01:57.322
- I was getting harassed a lot
in the DMs by people saying.

1312
01:01:57.452 --> 01:01:59.716
Why weren't you in the new
Jackass? Jackass stole your bit.

1313
01:01:59.846 --> 01:02:01.848
Have you seen the new Jackass?
How come they didn't ask you

1314
01:02:01.979 --> 01:02:04.024
to be in the mime bit?
Blah. blah. blah.

1315
01:02:04.155 --> 01:02:08.028
So I just posted an Instagram
video dressed as the mime.

1316
01:02:08.159 --> 01:02:11.118
and I said. You can't trademark
a genius idea.

1317
01:02:11.249 --> 01:02:13.381
Kind of egg on the people

1318
01:02:13.512 --> 01:02:15.644
that were already harassing me
about that.

1319
01:02:15.775 --> 01:02:18.082
And I guess Steve-O
might not have known.

1320
01:02:18.212 --> 01:02:21.825
He has known about me since 2017
when I snorted pepper spray

1321
01:02:21.955 --> 01:02:23.391
'cause he sent me
a video saying.

1322
01:02:23.522 --> 01:02:26.003
"Good job on the pepper spray
snort. bro."

1323
01:02:26.133 --> 01:02:28.875
And he said. "Looking at the
comments on your last post.

1324
01:02:29.006 --> 01:02:31.225
people are saying that we copied
you with our silent game bit.

1325
01:02:31.356 --> 01:02:32.749
Did you really do that first?"

1326
01:02:32.879 --> 01:02:34.838
And I just basically replied
saying.

1327
01:02:34.968 --> 01:02:37.101
Yeah. that's been my thing
for two. three years now.

1328
01:02:38.798 --> 01:02:41.192
And he replied saying
something like. "Yikes."

1329
01:02:41.322 --> 01:02:44.064
But moral of the story is that
I did get the follow back.

1330
01:02:44.195 --> 01:02:46.284
So...

1331
01:02:46.414 --> 01:02:48.590
Steve-O's been an inspiration.
so that's really cool.

1332
01:02:51.245 --> 01:02:53.073
I mean. who knows? Maybe
they'll do a Jackass 5

1333
01:02:53.204 --> 01:02:55.380
and I'll be the star.

1334
01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:58.862
You never know. I mean.
life can work that way. Right?

1335
01:03:08.349 --> 01:03:11.309
- I feel like things are just
getting worse.

1336
01:03:11.439 --> 01:03:15.487
You know? It's like
after the whole Subway thing.

1337
01:03:15.617 --> 01:03:18.446
when I just reflect
on my reputation.

1338
01:03:18.577 --> 01:03:22.407
I'm like... that thought of
suicide was definitely there.

1339
01:03:22.537 --> 01:03:24.757
It was there multiple times.
You know?

1340
01:03:24.888 --> 01:03:27.629
Even though I'm not dead.

1341
01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.936
I feel like it's only
a matter of time. I guess.

1342
01:03:30.067 --> 01:03:31.677
It's just deep depression.
I guess.

1343
01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:33.418
It does that to people.

1344
01:03:35.289 --> 01:03:39.903
For some people like myself.
it becomes your life.

1345
01:03:40.991 --> 01:03:44.516
I've adapted to it for so long.

01:19:51.438 --> 01:19:53.919
and a girl who really loves
her life now.

1679
01:19:55.312 --> 01:19:57.357
And I'm a girl who has
an OnlyFans.

1680
01:19:57.488 --> 01:20:00.796
and a girl who has a verified
check mark on Instagram.

1681
01:20:00.926 --> 01:20:04.495
I'm so many things. so why
ever put a label on it?

1682
01:20:04.625 --> 01:20:07.063
And I think people
want to do that really badly.

1683
01:20:07.193 --> 01:20:09.108
So I don't know.

1684
01:20:09.239 --> 01:20:12.068
I just... I am Ava.
That's that.

1685
01:20:18.335 --> 01:20:20.946
- The brand going forward is
just Jumanne

1686
01:20:21.077 --> 01:20:22.687
to kind of reflect
that I'm trying to change.

1687
01:20:25.211 --> 01:20:27.344
I'm just going to be myself.
you know.

1688
01:20:27.474 --> 01:20:29.563
So people that are genuine
enough to really

1689
01:20:29.694 --> 01:20:31.391
see me
for who I am.

1690
01:20:31.522 --> 01:20:34.177
they'll just see the transition
that I'm trying to make.

1691
01:20:36.919 --> 01:20:39.747
♪ You could see all of my flaws
I could never be right ♪

1692
01:20:39.878 --> 01:20:41.445
♪ 'Cause I'm usually wrong

1693
01:20:41.575 --> 01:20:44.665
♪ I won't ever be perfect
this the way I was born ♪♪

1694
01:20:44.796 --> 01:20:46.319
At this point. it's just
about me

1695
01:20:46.450 --> 01:20:50.149
doing everything that I need
to do to rebrand myself

1696
01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:51.977
and rebuild my platform.

1697
01:20:52.108 --> 01:20:54.110
It's just going to have
to speak for itself.

1698
01:20:56.939 --> 01:20:58.244
My recording session.

1699
01:20:58.375 --> 01:21:00.551
the engineer and producer
that I was working with.

1700
01:21:00.681 --> 01:21:02.988
just the relationship that
I've been building with him.

1701
01:21:03.119 --> 01:21:05.469
I'm happy about that.
It was great.

1702
01:21:05.599 --> 01:21:07.775
It was a good experience.

1703
01:21:07.906 --> 01:21:10.169
♪ Made it this far
I refuse to turn back now ♪

1704
01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:12.998
♪ Nothing left to lose
tell my why would I forfeit ♪

1705
01:21:13.129 --> 01:21:15.783
♪ Hate it or love it I'ma make
it out of the struggle ♪♪

1706
01:21:24.705 --> 01:21:27.360
It's been five years
since this all started.

1707
01:21:27.491 --> 01:21:29.580
and I'm done with all of it.

1708
01:21:29.710 --> 01:21:33.932
as far as all of this
struggling. the whole concept.

1709
01:21:34.063 --> 01:21:36.369
I'm going to just move forward.
man.

1710
01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:38.458
and move in a better direction

1711
01:21:38.589 --> 01:21:40.808
and learning from everything
that I did.

1712
01:21:40.939 --> 01:21:43.420
And I might not be able
to reach a point of success.

1713
01:21:43.550 --> 01:21:45.596
but I could definitely prove
that I'm not the person

1714
01:21:45.726 --> 01:21:47.380
that I portrayed to be.

1715
01:21:49.339 --> 01:21:51.297
Hey. y'all. What's good?
I'm doing it again.

1716
01:21:51.428 --> 01:21:53.778
Y'all want little
somethin' somethin'?

1717
01:21:53.909 --> 01:21:56.346
Yeah. that's all Jumanne.

1718
01:21:56.476 --> 01:21:58.826
And I'm just so happy.
I'm rapping.

1719
01:21:58.957 --> 01:22:00.828
I'm doing one of my dreams.

1720
01:22:00.959 --> 01:22:03.788
I really want to be a football
player. but it's all good.

1721
01:22:03.919 --> 01:22:06.486
Got my MySpace.
