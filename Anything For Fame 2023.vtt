00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:37.647
'Cause we were starting
to go into a lockdown.

174
00:08:37.778 --> 00:08:39.344
People are so scared of airports
right now.

175
00:08:39.475 --> 00:08:42.870
and I was going on a flight
to Miami for spring break.

176
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.307
and I was like.
"They hate spring break."

177
00:08:45.437 --> 00:08:48.092
So I was just like. perfect
opportunity to mix that all up.

178
00:08:48.223 --> 00:08:51.400
So I just went for it. and
I licked the airplane toilet.

179
00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:53.228
and I made the TikTok.

180
00:08:53.358 --> 00:08:55.796
Obviously cleaned the toilet
first. but that doesn't matter.

181
00:08:55.926 --> 00:08:57.624
I still licked the toilet.

182
00:09:02.585 --> 00:09:04.108
We didn't check my phone
for two hours.

183
00:09:04.239 --> 00:09:07.111
We go back. it's
at fucking 15 million views.

184
00:09:08.199 --> 00:09:09.636
And then I'm getting

185
00:09:09.766 --> 00:09:11.333
all kinds of calls and emails
from the news.

186
00:09:11.463 --> 00:09:13.770
That was my first time
being in the news.

187
00:09:13.901 --> 00:09:15.859
I loved how it felt.
I loved the clout.

188
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.339
I loved all the followers
I was getting.

189
00:09:17.469 --> 00:09:18.862
I loved all the attention.

190
00:09:18.993 --> 00:09:20.951
I loved the fighting.
the banter.

191
00:09:21.082 --> 00:09:23.301
just when I was gaining. the
interviews. I really liked it.

192
00:09:23.432 --> 00:09:25.477
That was probably
one of my biggest scandals.

193
00:09:25.608 --> 00:09:27.262
'cause that was
so international.

194
00:09:27.392 --> 00:09:28.872
and it was just wild.

195
00:09:29.003 --> 00:09:30.787
They wrote about my song
in the New York Times.

196
00:09:30.918 --> 00:09:32.746
Skinny Legend Anthem
isn't a good song.

197
00:09:32.876 --> 00:09:34.486
It's catchy.
but it's not a good song.

198
00:09:34.617 --> 00:09:36.227
â™ª I am a skinny legend

199
00:09:36.358 --> 00:09:39.927
â™ª Damn I might take your man
I got clout I got clout â™ª

200
00:09:40.057 --> 00:09:42.625
And so it's like. for me
to have my really bad song

201
00:09:42.756 --> 00:09:44.453
in the New York Times.

202
00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:46.498
people are going to Google it.
and they did.

203
00:09:46.629 --> 00:09:48.283
And now I have millions
of streams on that.

204
00:09:48.413 --> 00:09:50.720
I made a lot of money off of it.
And it's like...

205
00:09:50.851 --> 00:09:52.983
all I had to do
is lick a toilet.

206
00:09:54.506 --> 00:09:56.378
I would do it again.

207
00:09:56.508 --> 00:09:58.598
I'm planning things
that are similar.

208
00:09:58.728 --> 00:10:00.164
do again
and again and again.

209
00:10:04.212 --> 00:10:05.692
- I'm on fire!
I'm on fire!

210
00:10:05.822 --> 00:10:08.695
[shots. shouting indistinctly]

211
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.351
- We got to come up
with new ideas that are crazier.

212
00:10:13.482 --> 00:10:15.179
How much can you shock people?

213
00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:16.964
And that's the direction
that I kind of took it.

214
00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.795
Don't tell anyone. Okay?

215
00:10:21.925 --> 00:10:23.710
I couldn't find the bathroom.
- Hey?

216
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.842
- I couldn't find
the bathroom.

217
00:10:25.973 --> 00:10:28.062
Don't tell anyone. please.
Okay?

218
00:10:31.543 --> 00:10:33.197
Just kidding.
It's a water bottle. man.

219
00:10:33.328 --> 00:10:35.983
It's a water bottle.
He was getting so scared.

220
00:10:36.113 --> 00:10:37.941
We had filmed his clip

221
00:10:38.072 --> 00:10:39.551
where I'd shot a pellet
through my cheek.

222
00:10:39.682 --> 00:10:41.553
So we took a pellet gun

223
00:10:41.684 --> 00:10:43.773
and put it on the inside
of my cheek.

224
00:10:43.904 --> 00:10:46.994
- Don't do it. Turner.
Oh!

225
00:10:47.124 --> 00:10:49.300
- Pretty graphic.
but it worked perfectly.

226
00:10:49.431 --> 00:10:51.085
It shot right through.

227
00:10:51.215 --> 00:10:53.565
I could squirt beer out of it.
It was pretty cool.

228
00:10:53.696 --> 00:10:55.002
And so I sent that over
to World Star.

229
00:10:55.132 --> 00:10:56.960
Sent that to a bunch of
meme pages on Instagram.

230
00:10:57.091 --> 00:10:59.833
And I think World Star
ended up picking it up.

231
00:10:59.963 --> 00:11:02.009
Got like a million views
on World Star

232
00:11:02.139 --> 00:11:03.619
in like an hour
or something like that.

233
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:06.317
and I just remember
I gained like 3.000 followers.

234
00:11:06.448 --> 00:11:08.102
I had. like. 600 followers
at the time.

235
00:11:08.232 --> 00:11:09.756
I gained 3.000 right there.

236
00:11:09.886 --> 00:11:12.541
And that's when I was kind
of like. Whoa. this is cool.

237
00:11:14.282 --> 00:11:16.893
The excitement. I can describe
exactly where I was that night.

238
00:11:17.024 --> 00:11:19.374
I was working at Panera Bread.

239
00:11:19.504 --> 00:11:21.028
I was a dishwasher there.

240
00:11:21.158 --> 00:11:23.552
and I guess I had my phone
not on silent.

241
00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:26.860
and I had my Instagram
notification bell still on.

242
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:28.122
And I remember...
[imitates dinging]

243
00:11:28.252 --> 00:11:30.428
I'm like holy...
So I went to the washroom.

244
00:11:30.559 --> 00:11:32.692
and I'd seen everybody send it
in my DMs saying.

245
00:11:32.822 --> 00:11:34.737
"Yo. it's over 500.000 views."

246
00:11:34.868 --> 00:11:36.260
and I'm seeing
all this traction.

247
00:11:36.391 --> 00:11:38.872
I was like. holy...
I wanted to go home right there.

248
00:11:39.002 --> 00:11:40.830
I was so excited
to start replying to comments.

249
00:11:40.961 --> 00:11:42.353
And that's when I was kind
of like.

250
00:11:42.484 --> 00:11:45.095
Whoa. this is kind of bigger
than just my hometown.

251
00:11:45.226 --> 00:11:47.315
This is cool.
- Is your name Jake?

252
00:11:47.445 --> 00:11:48.838
- Yeah. that's me.

253
00:11:48.969 --> 00:11:50.710
- You're the dude
that does dumb shit.

254
00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.015
Dude. I'm following you
on Instagram!

255
00:11:52.146 --> 00:11:53.974
- This is what I wanted.
a little fan base.

256
00:11:54.104 --> 00:11:56.019
It doesn't have to be huge.
Just this little fan base

257
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.369
of people commenting.
and that come back every day

258
00:11:58.500 --> 00:11:59.806
to watch me for me.

259
00:11:59.936 --> 00:12:01.808
And I went home.
That was super exciting.

260
00:12:01.938 --> 00:12:04.419
Yeah. it was awesome.
[rock music]

261
00:12:06.769 --> 00:12:09.032
- What's up? It's Jumanne.
I just got out of the shower.

262
00:12:10.555 --> 00:12:12.557
Look.
I'll take this off.

263
00:12:12.688 --> 00:12:14.995
My blowup bed has a hole in it.

264
00:12:15.125 --> 00:12:17.649
So yeah. you know how this go.

265
00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:19.129
Got to go get
a new air mattress.

266
00:12:21.131 --> 00:12:23.264
Probably going to grab
this one right here.

267
00:12:24.439 --> 00:12:26.093
[beeping]

268
00:12:28.095 --> 00:12:29.792
All right. hold up.

269
00:12:29.923 --> 00:12:31.707
My receipt.

270
00:12:33.187 --> 00:12:35.058
He just wanted
to check my receipt.

271
00:12:35.189 --> 00:12:37.844
But yeah. I'm going to just
have to take the bus.

272
00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:44.589
My air mattress usually
probably lasts

273
00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.591
about three to four months.

274
00:12:46.722 --> 00:12:48.942
I just grab whatever I see.

275
00:12:49.072 --> 00:12:52.510
$10. $15. so I don't really
have a preference.

276
00:12:56.297 --> 00:12:58.908
I always have to blow it up
every three to four days.

277
00:12:59.039 --> 00:13:01.693
It'll be hard on my back
if I don't put air in it.

278
00:13:01.824 --> 00:13:03.957
[whirring]

279
00:13:04.087 --> 00:13:06.350
Yeah. so it can be an issue.

280
00:13:10.311 --> 00:13:12.966
You know. I just appreciate
the situation that I'm in.

281
00:13:13.096 --> 00:13:15.490
'cause I know it could be worse.

282
00:13:19.842 --> 00:13:21.409
[hip hop music]

283
00:13:21.539 --> 00:13:24.151
â™ª Guys I can't do this
until I have had nicotine â™ªâ™ª

284
00:13:24.281 --> 00:13:25.935
- I never went viral
on accident.

285
00:13:26.066 --> 00:13:27.284
I did it on purpose.

286
00:13:27.415 --> 00:13:29.069
I made the song Skinny Legend
Anthem with a plan.

287
00:13:29.199 --> 00:13:32.812
and it worked. Jeffree
and Kanye. It was a plan.

288
00:13:32.942 --> 00:13:35.162
I said. There's already rumors
about Kanye being gay.

289
00:13:35.292 --> 00:13:36.946
Let's play up on those.

290
00:13:37.077 --> 00:13:38.992
And I said. what would drive
TikTok kids crazy?

291
00:13:39.122 --> 00:13:40.558
How can I make
this all about me?

292
00:13:40.689 --> 00:13:42.647
So I immediately make
the TikTok. and I say.

293
00:13:42.778 --> 00:13:45.302
"This divorce comes as
no surprise.

294
00:13:45.433 --> 00:13:48.131
Kanye has been hooking up
with a very famous beauty guru.

295
00:13:48.262 --> 00:13:49.959
male beauty guru."

296
00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:52.744
Jeffree Star had moved
to Wyoming.

297
00:13:52.875 --> 00:13:55.747
and obviously that aligned
super well.

298
00:13:55.878 --> 00:13:57.314
'cause Kanye West lived
in Wyoming.

299
00:13:57.445 --> 00:13:59.708
So people were like. "Oh. my
God. this makes so much sense.

300
00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:01.231
Everyone ran with the story.

301
00:14:01.362 --> 00:14:03.059
People are making
TikTok about it.

302
00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:04.974
Now that Kim's finally
doing this. I feel like

303
00:14:05.105 --> 00:14:07.847
I can spill the tea that I've
been holding onto for months.

304
00:14:07.977 --> 00:14:10.066
This whole divorce
comes as no surprise.

305
00:14:10.197 --> 00:14:12.721
Kanye's been hooking up
with a very famous beauty guru.

306
00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:14.636
People in the scene
have known for a while.

307
00:14:14.766 --> 00:14:16.899
I wake up in the morning; it's
trending number one on Twitter.

308
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:19.336
and I was just like.
Oh. I did that.

309
00:14:19.467 --> 00:14:21.121
And then everyone
starts coming to my page.

310
00:14:21.251 --> 00:14:23.253
I'm getting millions
and millions of views.

311
00:14:23.384 --> 00:14:25.212
So I'm like. How can I keep
this story going?

312
00:14:25.342 --> 00:14:27.736
How can I keep it going?
I say Kim's suing me.

313
00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:29.869
Hey. TikTok. So I had to make
an emergency visit

314
00:14:29.999 --> 00:14:31.522
to my shopper's office

315
00:14:31.653 --> 00:14:33.089
to get an outfit for court.

316
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.309
because Kim Kardashian's
literally suing me.

317
00:14:35.439 --> 00:14:37.006
Like. thanks. bitch.

318
00:14:37.137 --> 00:14:38.616
I need an excuse
to shop anyway.

319
00:14:38.747 --> 00:14:39.879
Bring it on.

320
00:14:40.009 --> 00:14:42.446
And I made
a fake legal document.

321
00:14:42.577 --> 00:14:44.361
and I posted on TikTok.

322
00:14:44.492 --> 00:14:47.799
And the news ran wild with that.

323
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:50.237
because the media doesn't care
about being honest with you.

324
00:14:50.367 --> 00:14:51.673
Who wouldn't want to read

325
00:14:51.803 --> 00:14:54.023
about Kanye West hooking up
with Jeffree Star?

326
00:14:54.154 --> 00:14:57.592
So they didn't do any research
in it; they just ran with it.

327
00:14:57.722 --> 00:15:00.812
Kris Jenner says is
absolutely not true.

328
00:15:00.943 --> 00:15:03.119
makes a statement about me
to TMZ.

329
00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:04.947
And I mean.
it was crazy and it was funny.

330
00:15:05.078 --> 00:15:06.775
And then eventually
it was just like.

331
00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:08.124
Yeah. I made this all up.

332
00:15:08.255 --> 00:15:10.170
and me admitting I made it up
was even crazier

333
00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.867
because people were like.

334
00:15:11.998 --> 00:15:14.043
No fucking...
Like. this girl's crazy.

335
00:15:14.174 --> 00:15:16.176
Did I do harm?
Maybe a little.

336
00:15:16.306 --> 00:15:18.004
Was it ethical?
Absolutely not.

337
00:15:18.134 --> 00:15:20.397
Is anything in social media
ethical? No.

338
00:15:20.528 --> 00:15:22.138
Is the media ethical?
No.

339
00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:24.140
I'm just as bad
as everyone else.

340
00:15:24.271 --> 00:15:26.490
especially in that scandal
and that situation.

341
00:15:26.621 --> 00:15:30.407
And then I find out recently
that Jeffree Star and Kanye West

342
00:15:30.538 --> 00:15:33.454
were the fourth most
Googled couple of 2021.

343
00:15:33.584 --> 00:15:35.891
So I had that much influence
and that much power.

344
00:15:37.066 --> 00:15:38.328
That was crazy.

345
00:15:43.812 --> 00:15:46.032
- My first job. I was 17.

346
00:15:46.162 --> 00:15:48.469
I worked at Taco Bell.

347
00:15:48.599 --> 00:15:49.687
Mostly as fast food.

348
00:15:49.818 --> 00:15:52.603
I worked at McDonald's.
Burger King.

349
00:15:52.734 --> 00:15:54.954
I worked at CVS.

350
00:15:55.084 --> 00:15:59.132
I realized when it comes
to being a content creator.

351
00:15:59.262 --> 00:16:02.700
it's about resources.
it's about money.

352
00:16:02.831 --> 00:16:05.573
I don't have that.
I never had that.

353
00:16:05.703 --> 00:16:08.010
Everything I had was...
you know. it's a sacrifice.

354
00:16:08.141 --> 00:16:10.795
If I lose my computer.
and everything that I have.

355
00:16:10.926 --> 00:16:12.928
I can't afford
to buy it again.

356
00:16:14.277 --> 00:16:16.540
When I started thinking about
the controversial videos

357
00:16:16.671 --> 00:16:18.934
and why I created that.
it was free to do that.

358
00:16:19.065 --> 00:16:22.329
I can use this
to build a audience.

359
00:16:22.459 --> 00:16:24.722
and I don't have to pay
for promotion for this.

360
00:16:24.853 --> 00:16:26.550
The promotion's going
to come to me.

361
00:16:26.681 --> 00:16:29.510
I'm going to go forward with
this and see where it takes me.

362
00:16:33.775 --> 00:16:37.170
The first thing I say is going
to catch people's attention.

363
00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.433
so I try to swear.
and just saying fuck it.

364
00:16:39.563 --> 00:16:41.565
People are going to be like.
Oh. is this guy serious?

365
00:16:41.696 --> 00:16:43.132
I have to get
into that character.

366
00:16:43.263 --> 00:16:45.004
and I have to make it
believable.

367
00:16:45.134 --> 00:16:47.441
I just try to be
very aggressive.

368
00:16:47.571 --> 00:16:49.399
That's what's going to get
people's attention.

369
00:16:51.967 --> 00:16:54.230
Fuck Rite Aid.
CVS. bitch!

370
00:16:54.361 --> 00:16:56.015
[crashing]

371
00:17:00.889 --> 00:17:03.196
[crashing]

372
00:17:04.284 --> 00:17:06.199
We don't support none of this
shit right here. nigga.

373
00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:08.331
And I didn't know
if it was going to go viral.

374
00:17:08.462 --> 00:17:10.203
I didn't know
if it was going to work.

375
00:17:10.333 --> 00:17:12.161
I believed it would.
but wasn't really sure.

376
00:17:14.468 --> 00:17:16.818
Within three days.
I got 100.000 views.

377
00:17:18.298 --> 00:17:19.995
I was very happy
when that video went viral.

378
00:17:20.126 --> 00:17:22.563
It could be addictive. getting
all that kind of attention.

379
00:17:24.304 --> 00:17:27.002
I was real happy.
and I'm like. Yo. this is crazy.

380
00:17:27.133 --> 00:17:28.786
However people feel about it.

381
00:17:28.917 --> 00:17:30.440
whether you think
it's funny or you don't.

382
00:17:30.571 --> 00:17:33.661
if I can monetize this. if I can
get a fan base from this.

383
00:17:33.791 --> 00:17:36.098
then that's for myself.

384
00:17:40.102 --> 00:17:43.018
- Why do content creators
not stop?

385
00:17:43.149 --> 00:17:46.326
Internet fame is a fame
unlike on any other.

386
00:17:46.456 --> 00:17:49.024
There is no way to experience
internet fame

387
00:17:49.155 --> 00:17:50.504
unless you've experienced it.

388
00:17:50.634 --> 00:17:52.245
There's a dopamine hit

389
00:17:52.375 --> 00:17:54.508
that has no tangible experience
in real life.

390
00:17:54.638 --> 00:17:55.900
In fact. if anything.

391
00:17:56.031 --> 00:17:58.294
it's incredibly hard to describe

392
00:17:58.425 --> 00:18:01.123
internet fame to someone
outside the internet.

393
00:18:01.254 --> 00:18:03.691
That is a platform exploit
designed specifically

394
00:18:03.821 --> 00:18:06.128
to train people to do it again

395
00:18:06.259 --> 00:18:07.782
and then do it again
and do it again.

396
00:18:07.912 --> 00:18:10.872
- And that's why it becomes
an addiction for them.

397
00:18:11.002 --> 00:18:15.094
My name is Dr. Donna Rockwell.
and I'm a clinical psychologist.

398
00:18:15.224 --> 00:18:18.053
One of my key research interests

399
00:18:18.184 --> 00:18:20.708
is the psychology
of fame and celebrity.

400
00:18:20.838 --> 00:18:24.929
When somebody recognizes you.
when someone adores you.

401
00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:29.064
they become used to it. and
they want that hit of dopamine.

402
00:18:29.195 --> 00:18:31.719
but it can't last forever.

403
00:18:31.849 --> 00:18:34.287
[cheering]

404
00:18:37.638 --> 00:18:39.161
- Tell me your thoughts on this.
Are you excited?

405
00:18:39.292 --> 00:18:42.077
- I actually am.
No one wants to do it.

406
00:18:42.208 --> 00:18:43.470
I want to do this.
This is a great idea.

407
00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.341
- Yeah.
- I'm Jacob Hillhouse.

408
00:18:45.472 --> 00:18:46.951
and this is
the porta-potty rave.

409
00:18:47.082 --> 00:18:50.041
[shouting]

410
00:18:50.172 --> 00:18:52.174
I remember when
I first started this.

411
00:18:52.305 --> 00:18:55.395
one of my biggest inspirations.
Steve-O.

412
00:18:55.525 --> 00:18:57.658
I posted on Facebook.
you can go find it.

413
00:18:57.788 --> 00:18:59.355
I said. I'm manifesting this.

414
00:18:59.486 --> 00:19:02.619
I'm going to work with Steve-O
sooner than later.

415
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:04.491
2019. I got to work with him.
We did a video.

416
00:19:04.621 --> 00:19:06.362
He tattooed me.

417
00:19:06.493 --> 00:19:09.365
I actually have a tramp stamp
now. which is awesome.

418
00:19:09.496 --> 00:19:11.193
So that's one of
my biggest wins.

419
00:19:11.324 --> 00:19:12.977
I keep mentioning Jackass.

420
00:19:13.108 --> 00:19:14.501
but it's because
they're such a staple

421
00:19:14.631 --> 00:19:17.721
in this whole
content creation side.

422
00:19:17.852 --> 00:19:19.810
where when they stopped
making movies and stuff.

423
00:19:19.941 --> 00:19:21.943
there was a little hole
that wasn't filled anymore.

424
00:19:22.073 --> 00:19:23.510
You had a few one-offs.

425
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.599
but there was never people
that loved the craft

426
00:19:25.729 --> 00:19:27.644
of doing a stunt.
- Ready to see a big miss?

427
00:19:27.775 --> 00:19:29.080
- Buddy. I played a lot of Nerf
back in the day.

428
00:19:29.211 --> 00:19:30.299
- Ooh...!

429
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:33.911
[laughing]

430
00:19:34.042 --> 00:19:36.566
- I can do these crazy things.
I can make these awesome videos.

431
00:19:36.697 --> 00:19:39.308
I can create this content
without anything.

432
00:19:52.147 --> 00:19:53.322
- Hey. I remember
when I was a kid.

433
00:19:53.453 --> 00:19:54.976
I used to try to get away
with everything.

434
00:19:55.106 --> 00:19:57.413
Now I don't give a fuck.

435
00:20:00.329 --> 00:20:03.332
The next video I would post
would be

436
00:20:03.463 --> 00:20:06.117
a video that I did walking into
CVS. stealing.

437
00:20:06.248 --> 00:20:08.032
[man]: How much is that?

438
00:20:08.163 --> 00:20:10.252
- $19.99? Sheesh!

439
00:20:10.383 --> 00:20:12.559
That's way too much.

440
00:20:12.689 --> 00:20:16.606
Yeah. I'm going to just take
some Sour Patches.

441
00:20:16.737 --> 00:20:18.391
Lifesavers.

442
00:20:18.521 --> 00:20:20.480
- Can you get those
out of your pants?

443
00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:22.569
- Why would I take them
out of my pants?

444
00:20:22.699 --> 00:20:23.874
- Because it's disgusting.

445
00:20:24.005 --> 00:20:25.398
- Nah. I'm all good with that.

446
00:20:25.528 --> 00:20:27.269
I ended up getting arrested
for that.

447
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.053
I remember my first time
sitting in jail

448
00:20:29.184 --> 00:20:31.578
over these videos.

449
00:20:31.708 --> 00:20:33.449
I realized this is
way out of my control.

450
00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:34.624
I think I know
what I'm doing. but I don't.

451
00:20:34.755 --> 00:20:36.800
[crashing]

452
00:20:36.931 --> 00:20:38.498
When I was in jail.

453
00:20:38.628 --> 00:20:40.543
I knew that I was going
to have to make more videos.

454
00:20:40.674 --> 00:20:42.284
So that means I also have
to go to jail.

455
00:20:42.415 --> 00:20:44.678
When I get out of jail. I knew
that at some point in time.

456
00:20:44.808 --> 00:20:46.941
I was most likely
going to end up back in jail.

457
00:20:47.071 --> 00:20:50.074
- Going viral doesn't
guarantee

458
00:20:50.205 --> 00:20:52.163
you're going
to benefit financially.

459
00:20:52.294 --> 00:20:53.469
A lot of these influencers

460
00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.080
have to find ways
to make money themselves.

461
00:20:56.211 --> 00:20:58.779
- Gofundme.com/jumannestruggle.

462

463
00:21:08.136 --> 00:21:10.225
Follow me on Instagram.
@jumannestruggled

464
00:21:10.356 --> 00:21:12.183
- They're stuck trying
to figure out.

465
00:21:12.314 --> 00:21:14.447
"How am I going
to make money?"

466
00:21:15.535 --> 00:21:17.841
- Hello.
How's it going?

467
00:21:17.972 --> 00:21:21.062
I am Jade. also known
as Jadasaur.

468
00:21:21.192 --> 00:21:23.586
I love basketball.

469
00:21:23.717 --> 00:21:26.589
I like doing social experiments
just to see people's reactions.

470
00:21:27.982 --> 00:21:30.854
I'm a content creator.
so I like to make people laugh.

471
00:21:30.985 --> 00:21:34.075
I started just pumping out
content in Singapore for fun.

472
00:21:34.205 --> 00:21:36.773
because like. Okay.
this is a new experience.

473
00:21:36.904 --> 00:21:38.819
I didn't expect to gain
a following at all.

474
00:21:38.949 --> 00:21:40.647
I was just being stupid
in Singapore.

475
00:21:40.777 --> 00:21:42.605
and people.
they liked how weird I was.

476
00:21:43.737 --> 00:21:46.653
I was like. Oh. okay.
I'll just... Kept going.

477
00:21:46.783 --> 00:21:49.046
And that's when
the algorithm picked me up.

478
00:21:49.177 --> 00:21:51.135
It's like I won the lottery.

479
00:21:51.919 --> 00:21:54.574
Instagram is my funnel
for OnlyFans.

480
00:21:54.704 --> 00:21:57.533
and that's how I advertise
for OnlyFans.

481
00:21:57.664 --> 00:22:00.406
Instagram is the main advertiser
for OnlyFans.

482
00:22:00.536 --> 00:22:02.451
They come from TikTok
to Instagram.

483
00:22:02.582 --> 00:22:04.540
and then Instagram
to OnlyFans.

484
00:22:08.457 --> 00:22:10.851
Honestly. OnlyFans has
changed my life.

485
00:22:10.981 --> 00:22:13.767
It's given me financial freedom.
I wouldn't be able to live here

486
00:22:13.897 --> 00:22:16.465
if it weren't for OnlyFans.
to be honest. so...

487
00:22:16.596 --> 00:22:19.990
It's made so many creators
millionaires.

488
00:22:20.121 --> 00:22:22.384
I never would've.
in a million years.

489
00:22:22.515 --> 00:22:25.474
thought that I could
make money monthly

490
00:22:25.605 --> 00:22:28.390
just selling my pictures
and videos.

491
00:22:28.521 --> 00:22:31.175
and it's great.
[laughing]

492
00:22:31.306 --> 00:22:34.614
I can't complain.
Yeah.

493
00:22:38.095 --> 00:22:40.620
- Instagram's a fantasy.
It really is a fantasy.

494
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:42.665
and it's like
you're going on there.

495
00:22:42.796 --> 00:22:44.493
you're seeing the best
presentation of everyone.

496
00:22:44.624 --> 00:22:46.887
And that's why
I have a huge emphasis

497
00:22:47.017 --> 00:22:49.629
on just being hot.
because it's like. I have to be.

498
00:22:49.759 --> 00:22:52.762
Like every time I get a new
surgery. or when I do something.

499
00:22:52.893 --> 00:22:55.722
every time I change my look
or whatever. it just like...

500
00:22:55.852 --> 00:22:57.680
it helps.

501
00:22:57.811 --> 00:23:01.336
- It's bigger than "sex sells."
but sexualized content sells.

502
00:23:01.467 --> 00:23:05.296
And we can do that in extreme
ways like pornography.

503
00:23:05.427 --> 00:23:07.603
or in sort of more mundane.
subtle ways.

504
00:23:07.734 --> 00:23:10.476
like certain poses
that are very sexualized

505
00:23:10.606 --> 00:23:13.914
and taken from
porn chic aesthetics.

506
00:23:14.044 --> 00:23:15.959
are very flirtatious.

507
00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:18.266
and mimic what we might see
in traditional pornography.

508
00:23:18.397 --> 00:23:20.355
So it might not be porn.

509
00:23:20.486 --> 00:23:24.490
but it takes all of the poses
and gestures

510
00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:26.666
and formats of porn.

511
00:23:26.796 --> 00:23:29.233
and waters it down
for a mainstream audience.

[hip hop music]

513
00:23:43.378 --> 00:23:45.032
- Can you can describe
where we are. or...?

514
00:23:45.162 --> 00:23:46.860
- We're in the smoosh room.

515
00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:50.820
This is where we make
OnlyFans content.

516
00:23:50.951 --> 00:23:55.042
We have all had sex
on this couch over the years

517

when his parents go on vacation.

518
00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:59.960
On Thanksgiving.
we had an orgy here.

519
00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:01.744
Seven people.

520
00:24:01.875 --> 00:24:03.442
It's very squeaky. though.

521
00:24:03.572 --> 00:24:05.966
- You would know better than me.

522
00:24:06.096 --> 00:24:07.750
You just got with someone here
the other day.

523
00:24:07.881 --> 00:24:09.752
- Yeah.
- Half of her videos

524
00:24:09.883 --> 00:24:13.103
I'm basically a director in.
- He films them.

525
00:24:13.234 --> 00:24:16.411
- Our trusty favorite.

526
00:24:16.542 --> 00:24:19.458
- This has been
inside of us both.

527
00:24:19.588 --> 00:24:21.677
- It's like show and tell.
[laughing]

528
00:24:22.896 --> 00:24:24.593
So. we have duct tape.

529
00:24:24.724 --> 00:24:26.856
- For bondage play.

530
00:24:26.987 --> 00:24:29.729
- A screwdriver that I don't
know why is in here.

531
00:24:29.859 --> 00:24:32.601
but check out Ava's OnlyFans
to find out.

532
00:24:32.732 --> 00:24:34.603
- Yeah.

533
00:24:34.734 --> 00:24:38.389
That clip goes on the wall
to make people horny.

534
00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.609
and then
we sell them our nudes.

535
00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:41.958
I know you've heard
of gay for pay.

536
00:24:42.089 --> 00:24:43.699
He'll do straight for pay.
- Yes.

537
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:45.745
Yeah.
Well. I'm not bi technically.

538
00:24:45.875 --> 00:24:47.790
but I'll do stuff for money.

539
00:24:47.921 --> 00:24:49.792
- Someone wanted him
to shit on camera once.

540
00:24:49.923 --> 00:24:51.446
- I know.

541
00:24:51.577 --> 00:24:54.101
- How much did they
pay for that?

542
00:24:54.231 --> 00:24:56.233
- It wasn't that much.

543
00:24:56.364 --> 00:25:00.194
I was really drunk.
I took whatever they offered.

544
00:25:00.324 --> 00:25:03.327
And then they unsubscribed.
so I don't think I did it right.

545
00:25:03.458 --> 00:25:06.113
- Yeah. our friend shit
on some guy in a basement

546
00:25:06.243 --> 00:25:07.897
for 10 grand.

547
00:25:08.028 --> 00:25:09.551
- See. that I would do.
- Me too.

548
00:25:09.682 --> 00:25:11.335
Shit all over that guy.

549
00:25:11.466 --> 00:25:13.337
- I respect the hustle.

550
00:25:13.468 --> 00:25:15.252
- I would do it too.

551
00:25:15.383 --> 00:25:17.516
This guy just subscribed.

552
00:25:17.646 --> 00:25:18.691
Time to tell him
thank you.

553
00:25:18.821 --> 00:25:21.171
"Thank you for subbing."

[light music]

555
00:25:33.357 --> 00:25:37.405
- Yeah. So the mime was an idea
that we came up with.

556
00:25:37.536 --> 00:25:39.276
'Cause mimes.
they're silent. right?

557
00:25:39.407 --> 00:25:41.235
So when you're in pain.

558
00:25:41.365 --> 00:25:43.629
most of the time you're making
some sort of noise.

559
00:25:43.759 --> 00:25:46.109
You're screaming a swear word
or something. Aaah!

560
00:25:47.589 --> 00:25:50.157
So we thought.
Let's do painful things.

561
00:25:50.287 --> 00:25:52.681
you'll dress up as a mime. and
then you can't make a noise.

562
00:25:52.812 --> 00:25:54.509
You have to just use
your facial expressions.

563
00:25:58.818 --> 00:26:00.428
It's a stunt.

564
00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:03.257
We get that shock value
and that craziness to it.

565
00:26:03.387 --> 00:26:05.346
but then there's comic value
behind it.

566
00:26:05.476 --> 00:26:06.782
There's comedy to it.
people are like.

567
00:26:06.913 --> 00:26:08.697
Oh. that was crazy.
but it was funny.

568
00:26:08.828 --> 00:26:10.525
And that's what made Jackass
so successful.

569
00:26:13.441 --> 00:26:14.790
I like watching people get hurt.

570
00:26:14.921 --> 00:26:16.836
I bet everybody here has
watched Ridiculousness

571
00:26:16.966 --> 00:26:18.794
or America's Funniest
Home Videos.

572
00:26:18.925 --> 00:26:21.014
People want to see it
all the time.

573
00:26:21.144 --> 00:26:23.103
so there's people now like me
on the internet

574
00:26:23.233 --> 00:26:25.627
that will do it for you. and
you can watch it all the time.

575
00:26:28.021 --> 00:26:31.285
So yeah. for the mime.
it blew up on TikTok originally.

576
00:26:31.415 --> 00:26:33.766
So like. okay. let's keep
the mime gig going.

577
00:26:33.896 --> 00:26:37.596
I think I gained like a million
on TikTok in like two weeks.

578
00:26:37.726 --> 00:26:39.598
I'd never seen those
numbers before. Right?

579
00:26:39.728 --> 00:26:41.904
We started uploading them
to YouTube.

580
00:26:42.035 --> 00:26:43.950
People started going over
to our YouTube

581
00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.082
because at the end of the day.
YouTube is the main goal;

582
00:26:46.213 --> 00:26:47.388
that's where we drive everybody.

583
00:26:47.518 --> 00:26:49.129
And people love it. so...

584
00:26:59.748 --> 00:27:02.969
- I go by either Easton _Cyruss
or Peter Teatime.

585
00:27:03.099 --> 00:27:05.362
depending on the platform
that you'll find me on.

586
00:27:05.493 --> 00:27:08.583
I feel like Easton _Cyruss and
the TikTok content is more...

587
00:27:08.714 --> 00:27:11.064
of just fast-paced bangers.

588
00:27:11.194 --> 00:27:13.370
whereas the Peter Teatime
content was supposed to be

589
00:27:13.501 --> 00:27:16.547
more about parkour
and training and athletic stuff

590
00:27:16.678 --> 00:27:18.898
versus the high-risk stuff.

591
00:27:19.028 --> 00:27:20.943
But now they've kind of blended
into all being...

592
00:27:21.074 --> 00:27:22.945
the high-risk stuff.
[chuckles]

593
00:27:23.076 --> 00:27:25.382
I just found more success

594
00:27:25.513 --> 00:27:27.994
through the high-risk stuff
online.

595
00:27:28.124 --> 00:27:29.996
and the success of it
made me want to pursue that

596
00:27:30.126 --> 00:27:31.084
more than the other avenues.

597
00:27:33.216 --> 00:27:35.523
- What we click on
and what we interact with.

598
00:27:35.654 --> 00:27:37.220
whether we like it or not.

599
00:27:37.351 --> 00:27:40.267
this new attention economy
is brokered by all of us.

600
00:27:40.397 --> 00:27:43.444
We are the ones that get to
decide as consumers

601
00:27:43.574 --> 00:27:46.708
what gets pushed to the top and
who makes it in this world.

602
00:27:53.584 --> 00:27:56.109
I think what most people
don't know about influencers

603
00:27:56.239 --> 00:27:57.763
is it's a ton of work.

604
00:27:57.893 --> 00:28:00.243

As far as in why people would
want to watch.

620
00:28:44.679 --> 00:28:48.901
people want to see someone
that just came from the bottom

621
00:28:49.031 --> 00:28:51.686
and found a way to make it
to the top.

622
00:28:51.817 --> 00:28:53.775
and that might attract people.

00:28:53.906 --> 00:28:56.082
I'm about to add you right now.

00:28:56.212 --> 00:28:58.475
Yo. what's up bro?
[fan]: I got a question for you.

625
00:28:58.606 --> 00:29:02.175
So in that one where you were
running through the store

626
00:29:02.305 --> 00:29:04.568
knocking stuff off the shelves.

627
00:29:04.699 --> 00:29:06.745
what was going
through your mind?

628
00:29:06.875 --> 00:29:08.747
- I know this might sound funny.

629
00:29:08.877 --> 00:29:12.228
but I'm trying to make sure
nobody hurts me.

630
00:29:12.359 --> 00:29:15.231
and I try not to get
into any physical altercations.

631
00:29:15.362 --> 00:29:16.798
You know what I'm saying?
[fan]: I don't blame you.

632
00:29:17.712 --> 00:29:19.888
- Hey. you got to fight Jake
Paul.

633
00:29:20.019 --> 00:29:22.021
- Jake Paul? Jake Paul
would probably knock me out.

634
00:29:22.151 --> 00:29:25.198
I'll get in the ring. though.
I'll do it.

635
00:29:25.328 --> 00:29:27.940
I would do it just for
the publicity. though. honestly.

636
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:29.419
- Yeah. you really got to.
You just got to...

637
00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:31.291
- Just for the publicity.

follow. they going to follow.

00:29:33.728 --> 00:29:35.599
The people that support
is going to support.

640
00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:37.558
And that's all I could do.
is just try my best

00:29:37.688 --> 00:29:40.169
to move in a direction
I want to go in.

642
00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:42.781
and I just have to continue
to move forward.

00:29:42.911 --> 00:29:44.608
I don't know
what the future holds.

644
00:29:44.739 --> 00:29:45.871

- I'm from Jamaica. bro.
- Jamaica. All right.

648
00:29:52.878 --> 00:29:54.836
I was just asking. but yeah.
All right. go ahead.

649
00:29:54.967 --> 00:29:56.533
My fault. bro.

650
00:29:56.664 --> 00:30:01.887
- One of your most iconic lines
was. "$19.99. nigga?"

651
00:30:02.017 --> 00:30:06.630
- Sheesh! Yeah.
- Oh. my God.

652
00:30:06.761 --> 00:30:08.807
- Someone asked the question.
he said.

653
00:30:08.937 --> 00:30:10.896
"When are you going
to become happy?"

654
00:30:11.026 --> 00:30:13.072
That's a good question.
bro.

655
00:30:13.202 --> 00:30:15.335
That's a good question. man.
I don't know.

656
00:30:15.465 --> 00:30:17.511
I'm probably not going to be
satisfied

657
00:30:17.641 --> 00:30:21.428
until I'm making money
as a full-time content creator.

658
00:30:23.517 --> 00:30:25.214
I've been contacted
by so many people.

659
00:30:25.345 --> 00:30:27.738
and I do have people
that tell me. you know.

660
00:30:27.869 --> 00:30:30.002
keep my head up
and move in a better direction.

661
00:30:30.132 --> 00:30:32.221
People understand
the way how I feel.

662
00:30:32.352 --> 00:30:34.049
So yeah. if I didn't have faith.

663
00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:35.964
I wouldn't have done
the videos that I did.

664
00:30:40.229 --> 00:30:43.015
- There are no rules
for being a content creator.

665
00:30:43.145 --> 00:30:45.800
There's no more ad breaks.

666
00:30:45.931 --> 00:30:49.848
there's no more adherence
to some sort of structural

667
00:30:49.978 --> 00:30:51.675
"You can and cannot do this."

668
00:30:51.806 --> 00:30:54.635
We have to be aware that the
rules aren't established

669
00:30:54.765 --> 00:30:56.376
by the structure any longer.

670
00:30:56.506 --> 00:30:58.726
The rules are established
by the content creator.

671
00:31:02.251 --> 00:31:04.688
So one of my most famous climbs

672
00:31:04.819 --> 00:31:08.127
was the Golden Gate Bridge
in San Francisco. California.

673
00:31:09.258 --> 00:31:11.870
Guys. we've just made it
to the top.

674
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.349
This is incredible
to be honest.

675
00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.308
It's so beautiful up here.

676
00:31:15.438 --> 00:31:18.006
And I'm not allowed to talk
about how I climbed the bridge

677
00:31:18.137 --> 00:31:20.095
or any aspects of the climb
itself.

678
00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:23.098
It's a federal monument.

679
00:31:23.229 --> 00:31:26.797
and the repercussions of
climbing it were pretty severe.

680
00:31:26.928 --> 00:31:29.148
A British agency.
they picked up the story

681
00:31:29.278 --> 00:31:32.151
and they aired it.
and that very same day.

682
00:31:32.281 --> 00:31:34.588
thousands of people were
messaging me. news companies.

683
00:31:34.718 --> 00:31:36.590
"Hey. we want to do
an interview with you."

684
00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.505
And the story just blew up.
And my video went

685
00:31:38.635 --> 00:31:40.637
from 10 views on YouTube
to like 150.000.

686
00:31:40.768 --> 00:31:42.988
It just took off.

687
00:31:43.118 --> 00:31:44.903
Started seeing some
of the ad revenue flow in.

688
00:31:45.033 --> 00:31:46.817
I got really excited about it.

689
00:31:46.948 --> 00:31:49.559
And then the legal ramifications
hit me.

690
00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:53.607
Homeland Security
and the FBI got involved.

691
00:31:53.737 --> 00:31:55.914
And so they tracked me down.
They got in contact with me

692
00:31:56.044 --> 00:31:58.525
and they came to meet with me
in Wisconsin.

693
00:31:58.655 --> 00:32:00.266
For starters.

694
00:32:00.396 --> 00:32:02.355
we got hit with the criminal
case of trespassing.

695
00:32:02.485 --> 00:32:05.445
And then on top of that.
we got sued

696
00:32:05.575 --> 00:32:07.577
by the Bridge Authority
themselves for $50.000.

697
00:32:07.708 --> 00:32:09.405
And they pretty much
interrogated me.

698
00:32:09.536 --> 00:32:11.277
and they ended up
asking me about

699
00:32:11.407 --> 00:32:14.149
how could they prevent
other people from climbing it.

700
00:32:15.498 --> 00:32:18.153
It became a very high-profile
case in San Francisco.

701
00:32:18.284 --> 00:32:20.199
It was in the news every day.

702
00:32:20.329 --> 00:32:22.027
And the lawyer who ended up
taking my case

703
00:32:22.157 --> 00:32:24.420
was a rock climber.
and he felt for us.

704
00:32:24.551 --> 00:32:27.162
And he wanted the fame
of taking on the case.

705
00:32:27.293 --> 00:32:29.730
so he took it on for us
for a very low cost.

706
00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:31.819
and he got us off
of all the charges.

707
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:33.952
And it went over
pretty smoothly in the end.

708
00:32:40.393 --> 00:32:42.786
- You can DM. you can direct
message a celebrity

709
00:32:42.917 --> 00:32:44.658
on their account.

710
00:32:44.788 --> 00:32:47.791
which I think probably
gets people very excited.

711
00:32:47.922 --> 00:32:50.664
- Okay. first comment.

712
00:32:50.794 --> 00:32:52.535
- Comments. comments. comments.

713
00:32:52.666 --> 00:32:55.103
- "Ay!
Hearts. hearts. hearts."

714
00:32:55.234 --> 00:32:58.367
"Wow. Heart. heart. heart."
Lot of hearts.

715
00:32:58.498 --> 00:33:00.717
- My comments are like half
and half: half good. half bad.

716
00:33:00.848 --> 00:33:02.545
Or depending on the posts.
they're all good.

717
00:33:02.676 --> 00:33:04.373
or sometimes they're more
bad ones than good.

718
00:33:04.504 --> 00:33:07.246
- Perfect and sexy.
Thanks for the smile.

719
00:33:07.376 --> 00:33:09.204
Heart eyes. heart eyes.
heart eyes.

720
00:33:09.335 --> 00:33:11.511
- Dewayne Davis 84.

721
00:33:11.641 --> 00:33:14.601
"Clout is the most dangerous
disease out there."

722
00:33:14.731 --> 00:33:17.169
It's true. I mean.
it's true. It's...

723
00:33:17.299 --> 00:33:20.085
He said. "You're a masochist."
What does that mean?

724
00:33:20.215 --> 00:33:22.043
I keep getting those comments.

725
00:33:22.174 --> 00:33:25.394
I think it's someone
that likes pain.

726
00:33:25.525 --> 00:33:27.396
I think that's what that means.
I could be wrong.

727
00:33:27.527 --> 00:33:30.095
I'm not sitting there being
like. "Yeah. this is awesome."

728
00:33:30.225 --> 00:33:33.315
Yeah. no.
I'm definitely not a masochist.

729
00:33:33.446 --> 00:33:34.969
Yeah.

730
00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:39.321
"Kids with semi-well-off
parents. expensive hoodie.

731
00:33:39.452 --> 00:33:42.020
GoPro. martial arts
or gymnastics training.

732
00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:43.760
sense of entitlement.

733
00:33:43.891 --> 00:33:45.849
bored kids
with too much free time.

734
00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.287
and parents that pay
too little attention."

735
00:33:48.417 --> 00:33:50.376
I mean. he's pretty spot
on with all of that.

736
00:33:50.506 --> 00:33:52.987
but what's so bad
about a middle-class kid

737
00:33:53.118 --> 00:33:54.641
doing something he enjoys?

738
00:33:54.771 --> 00:33:56.773
- They're not going to say
bad things.

739
00:33:56.904 --> 00:33:59.124
I don't think
they'll say bad things.

740
00:33:59.254 --> 00:34:01.430
I have a pretty good fan base.
They love me.

741
00:34:01.561 --> 00:34:03.041
- You dumb as shit.

742
00:34:03.171 --> 00:34:04.651
Um...

743
00:34:04.781 --> 00:34:06.435
Yeah.
Straight to the point.

744
00:34:06.566 --> 00:34:08.785
I can't disagree.

745
00:34:08.916 --> 00:34:10.787
- You an inspiration to me.
You feel me?

746
00:34:10.918 --> 00:34:12.615
- I'm an inspiration? How?

747
00:34:12.746 --> 00:34:15.401
How I inspire you?

748
00:34:15.531 --> 00:34:18.317
- You inspire me by doing
crazy shit at grocery stores.

749
00:34:18.447 --> 00:34:21.015
and it just reminds me that
you got me to realize sometimes.

750
00:34:21.146 --> 00:34:22.843
you got to not give a fuck
and do what you got to do.

751
00:34:22.973 --> 00:34:24.932
You feel me?
- I feel you.

752
00:34:25.063 --> 00:34:26.977
That's not the kind of
inspiration I want to be.

753
00:34:27.108 --> 00:34:28.849
but I understand
where you're coming from.

754
00:34:40.948 --> 00:34:42.689
- Oh. damn.
This one hurts.

755
00:34:42.819 --> 00:34:45.735
Spensah said. "Boy from Whitby
suburbs still trying to make it

756
00:34:45.866 --> 00:34:47.476
after 10 years
of failed attempts."

757
00:34:47.607 --> 00:34:50.523
Damn!
Um...

758
00:34:50.653 --> 00:34:53.482
I am from the Whitby
suburbs.

759
00:34:53.613 --> 00:34:55.571
It hasn't been 10 years. man.
Give me a break.

760
00:34:55.702 --> 00:34:57.530
It's been maybe like
half of that.

761
00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:00.359
It hurts because it's like...

762
00:35:00.489 --> 00:35:02.056
It's not one of those ones
where it's like.

763
00:35:02.187 --> 00:35:04.145
"Look at this skinny asshole."

764
00:35:04.276 --> 00:35:06.800
It's ones that
I've personally sat down here.

765
00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:08.802
or like in my car
when I'm driving or something.

766
00:35:08.932 --> 00:35:12.458
that I've thought about.
that kind of gets myself down.

767
00:35:12.588 --> 00:35:14.503
So then it's like
when someone comments it.

768
00:35:14.634 --> 00:35:16.636
like. "Oh. damn. I have thought
about that before."

769
00:35:16.766 --> 00:35:19.378
So it kind of cuts deep.
If I've thought about it.

770
00:35:19.508 --> 00:35:21.293
Damn. that person's thinking
about it too.

771
00:35:21.423 --> 00:35:23.295
So it's like. Damn. it has been
a while.

772
00:35:23.425 --> 00:35:25.340
and I still haven't made it.
type thing.

773
00:35:25.471 --> 00:35:27.516
And then when you see someone
else put it into words.

774
00:35:27.647 --> 00:35:30.302
and it's publicly right there.
it's like. Oh. damn.

775
00:35:31.999 --> 00:35:33.696
You know what. Spensah?

776
00:35:33.827 --> 00:35:35.307
I'm going to remember that.

777
00:35:35.437 --> 00:35:37.352
I'm going to write down
that @name.

778
00:35:37.483 --> 00:35:39.920
and then five years from now. if
I'm still in the exact same spot

779
00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:42.052
that I am sitting
right here today.

780
00:35:42.183 --> 00:35:44.490
then I'll give you that W.

781
00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:47.188
But... for now.
yeah. that one hurt.

782
00:35:47.319 --> 00:35:48.842
Damn.

783
00:35:51.888 --> 00:35:54.761
- Everyone's on their phones
all the time.

784
00:35:54.891 --> 00:35:59.113
and people are getting less
face-to-face time. which is sad.

785
00:35:59.244 --> 00:36:02.160
but it's happening.

786
00:36:03.248 --> 00:36:05.075
How the tipping works
is that

787
00:36:05.206 --> 00:36:08.383
they can tip to send you
a message.

788
00:36:08.514 --> 00:36:10.646
So when they send you a message.

789
00:36:10.777 --> 00:36:12.953
they can request
anything they want.

790
00:36:13.083 --> 00:36:14.737
So they can basically
type like.

791
00:36:14.868 --> 00:36:16.391
"Hey. can I have these videos?"

792
00:36:16.522 --> 00:36:18.001
"Can I have these nudes?"

793
00:36:18.132 --> 00:36:20.047
"Can I have this kind of video?"

794
00:36:20.178 --> 00:36:21.527
"Can I have a JOI video?"

795
00:36:21.657 --> 00:36:24.530
Most often request I get
is JOI videos.

796
00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:26.880
Jerk off instructions.

797
00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:30.579
For some reason I think they
like to hear me talk to them.

798
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:32.233
It's just interesting.

799
00:36:32.364 --> 00:36:35.018
'Cause it's very personalized.

800
00:36:35.149 --> 00:36:37.195
and that's why they buy it.

801
00:36:37.325 --> 00:36:39.284
because it's directed
towards them.

802
00:36:39.414 --> 00:36:42.025
When they tip.
they can have any type of JOI.

803
00:36:42.156 --> 00:36:43.636
They can request.

804
00:36:43.766 --> 00:36:46.595
"Can you call me Daddy
at the end?" Stuff like that.

805
00:36:46.726 --> 00:36:47.988
Right?

806
00:36:48.118 --> 00:36:50.643
So they can make it
their own. like a story.

807
00:36:50.773 --> 00:36:52.732
[chuckles]

808
00:36:54.342 --> 00:36:56.736
[woman]: You're just looking
like that.

809
00:36:59.042 --> 00:37:01.654
- If you like to have Charli
dance to your song.

810
00:37:02.785 --> 00:37:05.745
I think I used to be more
ignorant to all this shit

811
00:37:05.875 --> 00:37:08.138
and the realities of social
media and life.

812
00:37:08.269 --> 00:37:10.967
and then I saw the effects that
it had on Ethan to get canceled.

813
00:37:11.098 --> 00:37:13.883
- My mirror broke. Um...

814
00:37:14.014 --> 00:37:16.103
How's your day going?

815
00:37:16.234 --> 00:37:19.672
- I was 20 when I met him

816
00:37:19.802 --> 00:37:21.717
and he was 16.

817
00:37:21.848 --> 00:37:23.893
I didn't know he was 16
when we met.

818
00:37:24.024 --> 00:37:26.374
because he told me he was 20.
and he lied.

819
00:37:26.505 --> 00:37:28.637
And we became friends before
I ever knew how old he was.

820
00:37:28.768 --> 00:37:31.771
so then I had to not care.
I felt really close to him

821
00:37:31.901 --> 00:37:33.816
because he understood me
and I understood him.

822
00:37:33.947 --> 00:37:35.905
And we both were working
social media.

823
00:37:36.036 --> 00:37:37.951
so we were very much helping
each other a lot with that.

824
00:37:38.081 --> 00:37:40.823
And then just losing that
was really hard.

825
00:37:40.954 --> 00:37:43.826
because it was just like losing
someone that was my partner.

826
00:37:43.957 --> 00:37:46.046
- Everyone's been trying
the giant straw challenge.

827
00:37:46.176 --> 00:37:47.482
so I'm going to try it.

828
00:37:47.613 --> 00:37:49.267
- His internet career started
falling apart

829
00:37:49.397 --> 00:37:51.269
'cause he made
some dumb decisions...

830
00:37:51.399 --> 00:37:52.400
[retches]

831
00:37:52.531 --> 00:37:54.272
...but that made him die.

832
00:37:57.405 --> 00:38:00.365
- I am Deanne Krusensterna.

833
00:38:00.495 --> 00:38:04.282
I am the mother of Ethan Peters.

834
00:38:04.412 --> 00:38:06.371
Ethan is supreme.

835
00:38:07.981 --> 00:38:10.070
Ethan will always be the
outrageous one of the group.

836
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.463
- Mwah!

837
00:38:11.593 --> 00:38:13.116
He is the one who is going
to say.

838
00:38:13.247 --> 00:38:16.119
"Hey. I'm here. Pay attention."

839
00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:21.037
He made well over six figures
right before COVID hit.

840
00:38:21.168 --> 00:38:26.347
But then he did a video
on TikTok.

841
00:38:26.478 --> 00:38:29.263
and there was a woman that
was taking her kids to Disney

842
00:38:29.394 --> 00:38:30.917
every single day.

843
00:38:31.047 --> 00:38:32.875
and he made a funny video

844
00:38:33.006 --> 00:38:34.921
about calling child
protective services.

845
00:38:35.051 --> 00:38:36.618
'cause that would be
a horrible thing.

846
00:38:36.749 --> 00:38:38.533
We are not Disney
kind of people.

847
00:38:38.664 --> 00:38:40.274
We'd rather go
to a rock festival.

848
00:38:40.405 --> 00:38:43.016
or anything
but hang out at Disney.

849
00:38:44.234 --> 00:38:46.759
- And we said. what if
your kids something else?

850
00:38:46.889 --> 00:38:48.804
What if they like Marvel
and stuff like that?

851
00:38:48.935 --> 00:38:51.067
And we were just making a joke.
Just 'cause you love Disney.

852
00:38:51.198 --> 00:38:52.765
what if your kids
don't love Disney?

853
00:38:52.895 --> 00:38:54.288
- They attacked.

854
00:38:54.419 --> 00:38:58.074
They decided that
he was making fun

855
00:38:58.205 --> 00:39:01.208
of this woman's children.
which he wasn't.

856
00:39:01.339 --> 00:39:04.646
They went after brands.
contacting brands.

857
00:39:04.777 --> 00:39:07.954
telling brands that
this is a horrible person.

858
00:39:08.084 --> 00:39:09.738
you shouldn't be using
this person.

859
00:39:09.869 --> 00:39:12.741
And brands started dropping him.

860
00:39:12.872 --> 00:39:14.961
- He lost all of his brand deals
and endorsements.

861
00:39:15.091 --> 00:39:18.399
loses followers. loses so much.

862
00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:20.270
And it really was.

863
00:39:20.401 --> 00:39:22.708
that's what sent him
over the edge. losing so much.

864
00:39:25.101 --> 00:39:27.495
- Instead of just saying.
you know what?

865
00:39:27.626 --> 00:39:29.236
I don't like this person.
I don't like their content.

866
00:39:29.367 --> 00:39:31.456
I'm not going to watch them.

867
00:39:31.586 --> 00:39:36.635
they find this need
to destroy them.

868

[alarm beeping loudly]

869
00:39:42.249 --> 00:39:44.469
- You know what?
I helped him make that TikTok.

870
00:39:44.599 --> 00:39:46.035
I don't really feel guilt
about that

871
00:39:46.166 --> 00:39:48.211
because Ethan did nothing wrong
in that TikTok.

872
00:39:48.342 --> 00:39:49.778
Nothing wrong at all.

873
00:39:49.909 --> 00:39:52.041
The internet decided to make him
think it was wrong.

874
00:39:52.172 --> 00:39:55.436
That's their fault.
Here's the thing:

875
00:39:55.567 --> 00:39:59.005
I will never think it wasn't
part of my fault that he's dead.

876
00:39:59.135 --> 00:40:00.876
I've gone through
our text messages

877
00:40:01.007 --> 00:40:03.009
and I've gone through our DMs.
and there'd be points

878
00:40:03.139 --> 00:40:05.011
where he'd be posting
about his life. and I'd be like.

879
00:40:05.141 --> 00:40:09.319
Go get a fucking Xanax.
I will never ever. ever say

880
00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:13.411
I'm not a part of the reason
that 17-year-old kid's dead.

881
00:40:27.816 --> 00:40:30.515
- She didn't have to use
the platform like that.

882
00:40:30.645 --> 00:40:32.342
You know what?

883
00:40:32.473 --> 00:40:35.520
She could have simply sent him
a message and said.

884
00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:37.435
"Hey. I was quite offended
by your video.

885
00:40:37.565 --> 00:40:40.481
But that video hurt my feelings

886
00:40:40.612 --> 00:40:43.136
and I would really be sad if my
kids grew up and saw it one day.

887
00:40:43.266 --> 00:40:44.964
Could you please take it down?"

888
00:40:45.094 --> 00:40:47.053
I guarantee Ethan probably
would've taken it down.

889
00:40:47.183 --> 00:40:49.882
They're still commenting on
his Instagrams every single day.

bullying a post of a dead child.

891
00:40:53.668 --> 00:40:56.628
- Another one.
"Bitch."

892
00:40:56.758 --> 00:40:59.718
She says. "This is what happens
when you let your son be gay.

893
00:40:59.848 --> 00:41:03.069
If you slapped the shit out of
him when he came out of you.

894
00:41:03.199 --> 00:41:04.984
then maybe this wouldn't have
happened."

895
00:41:05.114 --> 00:41:06.942
You're only on my account

896
00:41:07.073 --> 00:41:10.598
because you wanted
to leave this message.

897
00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:15.081
It's just absolutely insane.

898
00:41:15.211 --> 00:41:17.257
Who does that?

899
00:41:17.387 --> 00:41:20.042
- You have to be. That was a kid
making mistake 'cause he was 17.

900
00:41:20.173 --> 00:41:22.523
And you have to think about.
What did I do when I was 17?

901
00:41:22.654 --> 00:41:24.438
How did I act when I was 17?

902
00:41:24.569 --> 00:41:26.222
What are the mistakes
I've made in life?

903
00:41:26.353 --> 00:41:28.355
You have a privilege that
you didn't do that on camera.

904
00:41:28.486 --> 00:41:30.052
It's a fucking privilege.

905
00:41:30.183 --> 00:41:31.663
There's things that
I said on the internet.

906
00:41:31.793 --> 00:41:33.839
like. I'll look back on videos
I made on 2019

907
00:41:33.969 --> 00:41:39.105
and my Instagram archive.
and I'm like. yikes!

908
00:41:39.235 --> 00:41:42.282
I would never do that at 23
because I grew the fuck up.

spent 10 years...

913
00:42:18.144 --> 00:42:20.102
I didn't have no love
for it.

914
00:42:20.233 --> 00:42:21.669
I didn't have any passion.

915
00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:24.324
I didn't have that motivation
to get up every day

916
00:42:24.454 --> 00:42:26.326
and do this and do that.

917
00:42:29.938 --> 00:42:32.201
If I wasn't a content creator.

918
00:42:32.332 --> 00:42:34.987
I honestly think
I'd be in a lot of trouble.

919
00:42:35.117 --> 00:42:39.252
The chances of me committing.
like. real crimes...

920
00:42:40.949 --> 00:42:43.561
Probably would be a criminal.
like a real criminal.

921
00:42:43.691 --> 00:42:46.041
unfortunately.

922
00:42:46.172 --> 00:42:48.957
I don't know what I would do.
That's the problem.

923
00:42:49.088 --> 00:42:51.264
So I decided if I'm going
to go to jail.

924
00:42:51.394 --> 00:42:53.222
I'm going to go to jail
for these videos.

925
00:42:58.184 --> 00:43:00.447
I had one bad day at work.

926
00:43:01.927 --> 00:43:05.408
I look at the customers. they're
all the way to the door.

927
00:43:05.539 --> 00:43:08.586
things weren't moving the way I
wanted to. It was an impulse.

and I want it now.

929
00:43:11.632 --> 00:43:14.548

it's a lot of tolerance.

is temporary. bro. deadass.

I don't want to do this.

to be doing none of this.

And I don't know what else
to do. You feel me?

biggest fans. I guess.

00:44:26.751 --> 00:44:28.927
My yearbook quote:

954
00:44:29.057 --> 00:44:31.930
"I understand
the consequences of my actions.

955
00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:34.323
but I also understand
the benefits."

956
00:44:34.454 --> 00:44:36.325
It's a Jumanne quote.

957
00:44:36.456 --> 00:44:40.503
and it plays into
his entire YouTube persona.

958
00:44:40.634 --> 00:44:43.071
- Yeah. one day I'm going
to be a millionaire.

959
00:44:43.202 --> 00:44:45.291
All this is temporary.

Subway video he released...

so freaking much.

That video. when it blew up.
got over a million views.

965

Even my friends
got a hold of the video.

970
00:45:17.105 --> 00:45:21.544
And also. it made it
onto the local news as well.

971
00:45:21.675 --> 00:45:26.636
The Subway one really hit
the media for real. though.

972
00:45:26.767 --> 00:45:29.770
When he did that stuff.
he knew what he signed up for.

973
00:45:29.901 --> 00:45:32.120
I know he's doing it
for a reason.

974
00:45:32.251 --> 00:45:35.384
I know he's not just doing it
for clout. Right?

975
00:45:35.515 --> 00:45:37.473
I mean he is.

976
00:45:37.604 --> 00:45:40.259
but I don't think he's a bad
person when he does that stuff.

977
00:45:40.389 --> 00:45:43.001
He clearly knows it's wrong.

978
00:45:43.131 --> 00:45:45.699
And even though it's wrong.

979
00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:49.268
it's just there to get
the attention that he needs.

[neon buzzing lightly]

981
00:46:03.325 --> 00:46:05.545
- At the beginning
of when Jake started this.

982
00:46:05.675 --> 00:46:08.940
I don't think I understood
what the platform was

983
00:46:09.070 --> 00:46:10.811
or what it was intended for.

984
00:46:10.942 --> 00:46:12.160
All I understood was that
my son

985
00:46:12.291 --> 00:46:13.771
was making
some poor decisions

986
00:46:13.901 --> 00:46:15.381
and putting himself
in harm's way

987
00:46:15.511 --> 00:46:18.906
for laughter
or for comedic value.

988
00:46:19.037 --> 00:46:21.039
And as Jake was going
through high school

989
00:46:21.169 --> 00:46:22.997
and finishing up high school.

990
00:46:23.128 --> 00:46:25.086
and you hear about other
parents and their kids.

991
00:46:25.217 --> 00:46:27.785
and they're going off
to college or university.

992
00:46:27.915 --> 00:46:29.525
and my son's an influencer.

993
00:46:29.656 --> 00:46:31.527
I was like. I don't even
know what that means.

Are you going to go to school?

996
00:46:35.227 --> 00:46:37.403
So it's just a world
that I never knew.

997
00:46:37.533 --> 00:46:39.579
and I'm not even sure
that I could say

998
00:46:39.709 --> 00:46:41.276
I completely
understand it still.

999
00:46:41.407 --> 00:46:42.930
- I quit.

1000
00:46:43.061 --> 00:46:45.498
- I remember at a burger joint

1001
00:46:45.628 --> 00:46:47.761
was a young boy.

1002
00:46:47.892 --> 00:46:49.415
and he's just trying to...

1003
00:46:49.545 --> 00:46:51.809
You know. he's trying
to get Jake's attention.

1004
00:46:51.939 --> 00:46:53.854
And he's identified.
he knows who he is.

1005
00:46:53.985 --> 00:46:55.638
and he's trying to get
his attention.

1006
00:46:55.769 --> 00:46:57.379
and he wanted to take a picture
with Jake.

1007
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:59.729
Well. those are kind of like
smile moments for me

1008
00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:02.428
where... may not understand.

1009
00:47:02.558 --> 00:47:04.909
but those are the fun times.

1010
00:47:11.002 --> 00:47:13.047
- Having Ava as a daughter

1011
00:47:13.178 --> 00:47:17.138
has been very challenging.
to say the least.

1012
00:47:17.269 --> 00:47:20.228
I mean. the stunts she pulls
and all this stuff.

1013
00:47:20.359 --> 00:47:22.100
but I do have
to give her credit.

1014
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:26.452
The fact that she's...
worldwide news so many times.

1015
00:47:26.582 --> 00:47:29.890
and enough money to
be starting a 401k.

1016
00:47:30.021 --> 00:47:32.501
is very impressive
at your age.

1017
00:47:32.632 --> 00:47:34.677
And so...
Not that I like what she's...

1018
00:47:34.808 --> 00:47:37.071
I'd rather have her get married
to some guy.

1019
00:47:37.202 --> 00:47:38.638
- I don't want to do that.

1020
00:47:38.768 --> 00:47:40.901
Listen to this DM I got
from some guy:

1021
00:47:41.032 --> 00:47:43.469
"Just had a drink
with your dad in Manhattan.

1022
00:47:43.599 --> 00:47:46.080
He's so proud of you
and showed me your page.

1023
00:47:46.211 --> 00:47:47.995
Would love to connect."

1024
00:47:48.126 --> 00:47:49.910
Obviously
this creepy old man...

1025
00:47:50.041 --> 00:47:51.869
- But you didn't...
He's a plastic surgeon.

1026
00:47:51.999 --> 00:47:53.392
He's offering you
free plastic surgery.

1027
00:47:58.397 --> 00:48:00.660
- I never thought
about the fame.

1028
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:02.967
I mean. you would talk about.

1029
00:48:03.097 --> 00:48:06.405
"Oh wow. this clip got
so many likes. or whatever."

1030
00:48:06.535 --> 00:48:08.102
- Mm-hmm.

1031
00:48:08.233 --> 00:48:12.193
It never fazed me that
I would equate that with fame.

1032
00:48:12.324 --> 00:48:15.240
- Nowhere near where I want
to be in the social media.

1033
00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:17.764
I just want to keep building
followers and a fan base.

1034
00:48:17.895 --> 00:48:19.374
- See. and I'm oblivious
to all that.

1035
00:48:19.505 --> 00:48:21.202
- I never thought
that it would actually...

1036
00:48:21.333 --> 00:48:22.987
ever get to be this big.

1037
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.773
[yelping]

1038
00:48:27.905 --> 00:48:29.602
- Look at her on her pony
at the horse show.

1039
00:48:29.732 --> 00:48:31.909
She won a ribbon. Right?
She had a really nice life.

1040
00:48:32.039 --> 00:48:33.562
She just didn't like
how she looked.

1041
00:48:33.693 --> 00:48:35.347
You notice it.
- Yeah. 'cause she bullied me.

1042
00:48:35.477 --> 00:48:37.218
- I did.

1043
00:48:37.349 --> 00:48:39.829
I bullied her 'cause
I didn't want her to get fat.

1044
00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:41.440
She wouldn't stop eating out.

1045
00:48:41.570 --> 00:48:43.398
- So I got an eating disorder
and threw up everywhere.

1046
00:48:43.529 --> 00:48:45.357
She used to go on a bikini
on her trampoline

1047
00:48:45.487 --> 00:48:47.707
and bounce on the trampoline
in a bikini

1048
00:48:47.837 --> 00:48:49.361
to make all the moms upset.

1049
00:48:49.491 --> 00:48:52.668
And the kids would come home
on the bus from school.

1050
00:48:52.799 --> 00:48:55.280
and then we would all see my
mother in a bikini. bouncing.

1051
00:48:55.410 --> 00:48:57.064
- Guilty.

1052
00:48:57.195 --> 00:49:00.154
- And she wonders
why I have an OnlyFans.

1053
00:49:02.765 --> 00:49:04.550
- It's been tough at times

1054
00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:06.421
watching certain stunts
or activities

1055
00:49:06.552 --> 00:49:08.815
that my son has done that he
would put himself in harm's way.

1056
00:49:08.946 --> 00:49:11.600
And as a mom. you want
your children safe.

1057
00:49:11.731 --> 00:49:14.081
And to see him
cause himself harm...

1058
00:49:14.212 --> 00:49:15.909
Because I think at that age.

1059
00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:17.780
you don't think anything's
ever going to happen.

1060
00:49:17.911 --> 00:49:19.521
You assume that all
will be well.

1061
00:49:19.652 --> 00:49:21.349
or always going to recover.

1062
00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:23.351
And as a parent. you always
look at. "What if it doesn't?"

1063
00:49:23.482 --> 00:49:24.831
What if that one time...?

1064
00:49:24.962 --> 00:49:26.267
- Okay. Go again.
Let's go again.

1065
00:49:26.398 --> 00:49:28.356
Ready?
We're going to go.

1066
00:49:28.487 --> 00:49:30.315
- So I definitely had
some strains for sure.

1067
00:49:30.445 --> 00:49:33.187
And you try to be understanding
and tolerant

1068
00:49:33.318 --> 00:49:36.582
but still provide the direction
and guidance

1069
00:49:36.712 --> 00:49:39.585
as to what they're doing
might not be viewed as favorably

1070
00:49:39.715 --> 00:49:41.108
in the general public.

1071
00:49:41.239 --> 00:49:44.024
But it's been...

1072
00:49:44.155 --> 00:49:46.592
it has been challenging
throughout some of the years.

1073
00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:54.817
- I don't like the
rooftopping at all.

1074
00:49:54.948 --> 00:49:56.863
- Which is fair.
- We've had fights.

1075
00:49:56.994 --> 00:49:58.473
I've yelled and I've...

1076
00:49:58.604 --> 00:50:01.172
"You're not doing this!"
Well. I'm not going to...

1077
00:50:01.302 --> 00:50:03.609
- I'm 22 years old.
- ...ground a 22-year-old guy!

1078
00:50:03.739 --> 00:50:06.090
What am I going to do?
You know...

1079
00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:08.744
And then he would say.
Well. I wouldn't do it

1080
00:50:08.875 --> 00:50:11.095
if I wasn't comfortable
doing it.

1081
00:50:11.225 --> 00:50:13.836
I wouldn't do it if I knew
I was going to get hurt.

1082
00:50:13.967 --> 00:50:16.622
I wouldn't do it
if I knew I couldn't do it.

1083
00:50:16.752 --> 00:50:18.537
And I said.
Well. accidents happen.

1084
00:50:18.667 --> 00:50:21.540
And I pray a lot for him.

1085
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:23.411
A really lot.

1086
00:50:39.036 --> 00:50:40.472
So I have blonde hair now.

1087
00:50:41.951 --> 00:50:43.910
I've got a nice mustache
going on.

1088
00:50:44.041 --> 00:50:45.955
The new Jackass movie
just came out.

1089
00:50:47.174 --> 00:50:48.697
They took
one of my bits. I think.

1090
00:50:48.828 --> 00:50:51.135
What are you going to do?
It's the internet.

1091
00:50:51.265 --> 00:50:54.573
I can't trademark a video.

1092
00:50:54.703 --> 00:50:57.315
I can't trademark the mime.
You know?

1093
00:50:57.445 --> 00:50:59.621
People have been doing it
since. I don't know. 1920s.

1094
00:50:59.752 --> 00:51:01.449
[yelling]

1095
00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:04.496
Yeah. it sucks.
But it is what it is.

1096
00:51:04.626 --> 00:51:06.889
Steve-O's been an inspiration.

1097
00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:08.108
I've mentioned that many times.

1098
00:51:08.239 --> 00:51:10.328
that Steve-O is kind
of the reason

1099
00:51:10.458 --> 00:51:12.156
why I got into doing stunts
and stuff.

1100
00:51:12.286 --> 00:51:14.114
And yeah. with the whole
mime bit.

1101
00:51:14.245 --> 00:51:18.118
it was a clearcut ripoff
to the tee.

1102
00:51:18.249 --> 00:51:20.338
even with the skateboard
hitting the shin.

1103
00:51:20.468 --> 00:51:22.166
Would've been nice
to get the invite.

1104
00:51:22.296 --> 00:51:24.342
It would've been cool to get
a little bit of credit in there.

1105
00:51:24.472 --> 00:51:26.561
But what are you going to do?

1106
00:51:29.173 --> 00:51:30.652
Good shot.

1107
00:51:32.828 --> 00:51:34.482
The butter is
on the top. dude.

1108
00:51:34.613 --> 00:51:36.223
Fucking ridiculous.

1109
00:51:38.312 --> 00:51:40.706
"Do not attempt any of the
stunts you're about to see."

1110
00:51:40.836 --> 00:51:43.056
If only a whole generation
listened to that. bro.

1111
00:51:43.187 --> 00:51:44.884
Legit. man.

1112
00:51:50.803 --> 00:51:52.152
[laughing]

1113
00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:54.415
Yo!

1114
00:51:54.546 --> 00:51:55.634
Dude. he just...

1115
00:51:55.764 --> 00:51:57.897
Yo. what the fuck?

1116
00:51:58.854 --> 00:52:00.378
Wow.

1117
00:52:01.857 --> 00:52:03.294
[onscreen]:
This is the quiet game.

1118
00:52:03.424 --> 00:52:05.948
- Okay. Here's my live reaction

1119
00:52:06.079 --> 00:52:07.820
to seeing Jackass
take the mime idea.

1120
00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:09.387
[onscreen]: Are you ready?

1121
00:52:09.517 --> 00:52:11.432
[yelling onscreen]
- Oh. my God. dude.

1122
00:52:11.563 --> 00:52:14.087
- So confidence is...

1123
00:52:14.218 --> 00:52:16.394
- Yeah. they fully
kind of took it. but...

1124
00:52:21.399 --> 00:52:24.358
[ethereal music]

1125
00:52:32.236 --> 00:52:34.890
It's kind of like
a fresh start a little bit.

1126
00:52:35.021 --> 00:52:37.719
So that's how I'm going
to try and look at it.

1127
00:52:37.850 --> 00:52:39.286
And I don't know.

1128
00:52:39.417 --> 00:52:41.506
I think it's time to retire
the whole mime thing.

1129
00:52:41.636 --> 00:52:43.769
I want to be known
as Jake Hillhouse too;

1130
00:52:43.899 --> 00:52:46.250
I don't want to be known as the
guy that puts on mime makeup

1131
00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:48.991
and fucks himself up.
You know?

1132
00:52:49.122 --> 00:52:51.994
I mean. Steve-O made a noise.
and I never made a noise.

1133
00:52:52.125 --> 00:52:54.301
So I got him on that.

1134
00:53:05.007 --> 00:53:06.270
- Where should we start?

1135
00:53:07.749 --> 00:53:11.188
This... this is my gold
Chanel bag.

1136
00:53:11.318 --> 00:53:13.842
It's covered in flies.

1137
00:53:14.713 --> 00:53:16.454
because though
I am an influencer.

1138
00:53:16.584 --> 00:53:19.935
I live like the dirty
ratchet Jersey bitch I am.

1139
00:53:20.066 --> 00:53:23.591
This bag was $6.000.

1140
00:53:23.722 --> 00:53:25.550
People look at it
and they're like. Oh. my God.

1141
00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:27.813
that's the most gorgeous
Chanel bag I've ever seen.

1142
00:53:27.943 --> 00:53:29.206
And it's just special
and different.

1143
00:53:29.336 --> 00:53:30.859
I only buy bags
that are special.

1144
00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:32.861
This is my latest purchase.

1145
00:53:32.992 --> 00:53:35.342
I thought the color
was quite pretty.

1146
00:53:35.473 --> 00:53:38.476
This is how I would imagine
unicorn semen would look

1147
00:53:38.606 --> 00:53:41.130
if a unicorn ejaculated
onto a purse.

1148
00:53:41.261 --> 00:53:42.784
This is kind of the vibe I got.

1149
00:53:42.915 --> 00:53:44.656
This is the real prize.

1150
00:53:44.786 --> 00:53:46.223
Little dirty.

1151
00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:50.879
This one was like 7.000.

1152
00:53:51.010 --> 00:53:54.405
This one was 4.000.
which is cheaper for my bags.

1153
00:53:54.535 --> 00:53:55.884
I just started collecting them.

1154
00:53:56.015 --> 00:53:57.799
I got a designer purse
addiction.

1155
00:53:57.930 --> 00:53:59.801
And I got addicted
to the fucking bags.

1156
00:53:59.932 --> 00:54:01.673
And I didn't even carry them.

1157
00:54:01.803 --> 00:54:03.631
I would just go to the store
and see one that was cute.

1158
00:54:03.762 --> 00:54:05.242
and I could afford it.
so I bought it.

1159
00:54:05.372 --> 00:54:06.765
Then I realized
at the end of the year.

1160
00:54:06.895 --> 00:54:10.247
I was just like.
I spent at least $150.000

1161
00:54:10.377 --> 00:54:12.771
on purses that
I don't even carry.

1162
00:54:12.901 --> 00:54:17.036
Oh. no. It appears
the cats have chewed it.

1163
00:54:17.166 --> 00:54:18.559
Oh. no.

1164
00:54:18.690 --> 00:54:20.344
My cats chewed on this.

1165
00:54:20.474 --> 00:54:22.041
That sucks.

1166
00:54:22.911 --> 00:54:24.478
Oh. well.

1167
00:54:24.609 --> 00:54:26.915
Guess it's staying with me
and not ever being sold.

1168
00:54:27.046 --> 00:54:28.656
[coughs]

1169
00:54:28.787 --> 00:54:30.310
Not that I would want
to sell this one anyway.

1170
00:54:30.441 --> 00:54:33.835
I got rich way too fast.

1171
00:54:33.966 --> 00:54:35.924
I made a very immature decision.

1172
00:54:36.055 --> 00:54:38.057
So if you get really rich
off the internet.

1173
00:54:38.187 --> 00:54:40.407
save it
and don't buy dumb shit.

1174
00:54:40.538 --> 00:54:44.281
'Cause it's like when you give a
21-year-old six figures a year.

1175
00:54:44.411 --> 00:54:46.370
and obviously she's going
to blow it on Chanel bags.

1176
00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:49.068
Now I'm getting older
and realizing

1177
00:54:49.198 --> 00:54:52.071
I should invest my money
on myself and my ass.

1178
00:54:52.201 --> 00:54:54.334
It's an investment.

1179
00:55:10.959 --> 00:55:13.222
[clanging]

1180
00:55:17.052 --> 00:55:19.141
- Um. I could...

1181
00:55:19.272 --> 00:55:21.753
The amount of money
that I've made over time

1182
00:55:21.883 --> 00:55:24.277
from my content.

1183
00:55:24.408 --> 00:55:26.540
I probably made
a little bit more than $500.

1184
00:55:26.671 --> 00:55:29.413
But that's over two years maybe.

1185
00:55:29.543 --> 00:55:33.068
I didn't make anything
that was worth it financially.

1186
00:55:33.199 --> 00:55:36.768
I've made money.
but it wasn't worth it.

1187
00:55:43.078 --> 00:55:46.299
- I think a lot of what's
driving influencer culture

1188
00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:52.392
is the dream or allure that
you might be able to make it

1189
00:55:52.523 --> 00:55:54.655
and that it might be lucrative.

1190
00:55:54.786 --> 00:55:56.788
and you could be the one
that goes viral.

1191
00:55:56.918 --> 00:56:01.314
So that's what's making
the content get pushed out.

1192
00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:10.192
- Statistically. to be
a super famous. I'm talking

1193
00:56:10.323 --> 00:56:13.631
top-end. super famous
internet celebrity YouTuber.

1194
00:56:13.761 --> 00:56:16.111
your odds are extremely low.

1195
00:56:16.242 --> 00:56:19.680
There are over 3.000 channels
making six figures a year

1196
00:56:19.811 --> 00:56:21.203
on YouTube:

1197
00:56:21.334 --> 00:56:23.249
underneath one tenth
of one tenth of 1%.

1198
00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:24.468
Not good.

1199
00:56:24.598 --> 00:56:25.991
Your odds.

1200
00:56:26.121 --> 00:56:27.819
your current odds.

1201
00:56:27.949 --> 00:56:31.562
are easier to get drafted
onto a professional sports team

1202
00:56:31.692 --> 00:56:33.346
and go to Harvard

1203
00:56:33.477 --> 00:56:35.304
and then get drafted
onto another sports team

1204
00:56:35.435 --> 00:56:38.046
is easier than becoming
a super famous YouTuber.

1205
00:56:38.177 --> 00:56:41.833
So it is statistically
difficult

1206
00:56:41.963 --> 00:56:44.575
to become super famous.

1207
00:56:44.705 --> 00:56:47.360
That being said.
anyone can do it.

1208
00:56:53.975 --> 00:56:55.890
- Anybody want to join the live?

1209
00:56:58.066 --> 00:57:00.939
Damn. Terrence ain't pop up
or Teddy. This is crazy.

1210
00:57:01.069 --> 00:57:04.290
They're not even here. bro.
at all.

1211
00:57:05.291 --> 00:57:07.467
Um...

1212
00:57:09.382 --> 00:57:11.340
Yeah. I mean. it is what it is.

1213
00:57:11.471 --> 00:57:13.299
You know what I'm saying?
So...

1214
00:57:18.739 --> 00:57:21.089
Might of have had
a couple viral videos.

1215
00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:23.178
but that doesn't mean nothing.
I didn't make any real...

1216
00:57:23.309 --> 00:57:25.746
I didn't make almost any money
off those videos.

1217
00:57:25.877 --> 00:57:29.141
so regardless
on how many millions of views

1218
00:57:29.271 --> 00:57:32.884
that my videos generated.
it hasn't done anything for me.

1219
00:57:33.014 --> 00:57:36.191
My reality is I have
a bad reputation locally.

1220
00:57:36.322 --> 00:57:39.064
The people that are coming
to my profiles

1221
00:57:39.194 --> 00:57:40.587
and sending me messages.

1222
00:57:40.718 --> 00:57:42.502
but they're coming out
of the controversy.

1223
00:57:42.633 --> 00:57:43.982
so they're coming through hate.

1224
00:57:44.112 --> 00:57:46.201
They're angry
and they want to criticize.

1225
00:57:46.332 --> 00:57:48.160
And that's really it. it is.

1226
00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:51.119
And everything I did is like
a circus. I was a clown.

1227
00:57:51.250 --> 00:57:53.644
And if I'm going to be a clown.
I have to be a clown.

1228
00:57:53.774 --> 00:57:55.428
I can't just take off
the clown suit

1229
00:57:55.559 --> 00:57:56.821
and put on a business suit

1230
00:57:56.951 --> 00:57:58.866
and think people are going
to stay for the show.

1231
00:57:58.997 --> 00:58:00.738
They're not.
They came to see a clown.

1232
00:58:00.868 --> 00:58:02.130
That's what they came
to the circus for.

1233
00:58:02.261 --> 00:58:03.958
They want to see the act.

1234
00:58:08.659 --> 00:58:12.576
"What's a message you hope
to express most in your story?"

1235
00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:19.887
I don't know.

1236
00:58:20.018 --> 00:58:21.759
Just a person trying
to find himself.

1237
00:58:21.889 --> 00:58:23.804
I don't know.
I don't know.

1238
00:58:23.935 --> 00:58:25.763
I'm just a regular person. bro.
Just a human being.

1239
00:58:42.649 --> 00:58:44.869
- My TikTok has been deleted.
which sucks.

1240
00:58:44.999 --> 00:58:46.566
Tried appealing it.

1241
00:58:46.697 --> 00:58:48.220
Doesn't look like
it's happening.

1242
00:58:48.350 --> 00:58:50.309
They have the ability
to just take you down.

1243
00:58:50.439 --> 00:58:52.920
[yelling]
Pry it open.

1244
00:58:53.051 --> 00:58:55.096
Ow. fuck!

1245
00:58:55.227 --> 00:58:58.578
Yeah. I think I was taken down
for self-harm. which.

1246
00:58:58.709 --> 00:59:00.537
you know. it kind of makes
sense. it kind of doesn't.

1247
00:59:00.667 --> 00:59:02.147
I don't know.
It just sucks

1248
00:59:02.277 --> 00:59:05.890
'cause that was a big form
of numbers

1249
00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:08.327
to push towards my YouTube
and push towards my Instagram.

1250
00:59:08.457 --> 00:59:09.981
So yeah. it sucks.

1251
00:59:10.111 --> 00:59:13.114
I didn't make a single dollar.
at least not from TikTok.

1252
00:59:13.245 --> 00:59:14.812
I didn't make a single dollar.

1253
00:59:14.942 --> 00:59:18.859
So to dumb it down for you.

1254
00:59:18.990 --> 00:59:20.731
I don't know what's next.
but I do know

1255
00:59:20.861 --> 00:59:23.777
that I do want to reshape it so
that I can do this for a living.

1256
00:59:23.908 --> 00:59:27.694
Because right now I'm not
doing it for a living.

1257
00:59:27.825 --> 00:59:30.088
'cause I don't make anything
from it really.

1258
00:59:39.706 --> 00:59:42.535
- I forever am going
to be looked at

1259
00:59:42.666 --> 00:59:44.972
as the girl who licked a toilet
seat. but who cares?

1260
00:59:45.103 --> 00:59:47.888
If I licked a toilet seat
and I was really ugly.

1261
00:59:48.019 --> 00:59:52.501
I would not have gone
as explosive as it did.

1262
00:59:52.632 --> 00:59:55.287
But there was some sex appeal
in me licking that toilet seat.

1263
00:59:55.417 --> 00:59:57.289
You know what I'm saying?

1264
00:59:57.419 --> 01:00:00.074
And it's like. if I was an ugly
girl licking a toilet seat.

1265
01:00:00.205 --> 01:00:02.599
it wouldn't have done
as the numbers did.

1266
01:00:02.729 --> 01:00:05.471
But I think especially
what I do for a living.

1267
01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:09.518
sex just really sells.

1268
01:00:09.649 --> 01:00:13.348
You cannot be a woman
who has zero talent.

1269
01:00:13.479 --> 01:00:15.133
Like. I don't have talent.

1270
01:00:15.263 --> 01:00:18.571
My talent is manipulating
the media and blowing up online.

1271
01:00:18.702 --> 01:00:19.616
I would say that's talent.

1272
01:00:19.746 --> 01:00:21.530
But besides that.

1273
01:00:21.661 --> 01:00:23.271
we live in a society
where we're seen as objects.

1274
01:00:23.402 --> 01:00:24.838
We just are.

1275
01:00:24.969 --> 01:00:26.840
And a lot of people
don't want to admit it.

1276
01:00:26.971 --> 01:00:28.799
There are women
who don't want to appeal

1277
01:00:28.929 --> 01:00:31.192
to the male gaze and they go
very against the grain.

1278
01:00:31.323 --> 01:00:33.368
And good for them for that.
But I'm not going to do that

1279
01:00:33.499 --> 01:00:35.806
because I see the advantage
of taking over the male gaze.

1280
01:00:35.936 --> 01:00:37.416
And if men just want
to have sex with me

1281
01:00:37.546 --> 01:00:38.896
and see me as a sex object.

1282
01:00:39.026 --> 01:00:41.028
'cause it's what was happening
to me for years

1283
01:00:41.159 --> 01:00:43.161
and happening to every girl
I've ever known.

1284
01:00:43.291 --> 01:00:45.293
I was just like. Well.
let's just make money off of it.

1285
01:00:45.424 --> 01:00:46.947
Just in general.

1286
01:00:47.078 --> 01:00:48.645
there are girls
who don't have OnlyFans

1287
01:00:48.775 --> 01:00:50.647
who are getting used by men.

1288
01:00:50.777 --> 01:00:53.171
At least
I make money off of it.

1289
01:00:53.301 --> 01:00:55.608
'cause you could not be
a little sexy internet girl.

1290
01:00:55.739 --> 01:00:57.349
but then you'll have to go work
a nine-to-five.

1291
01:00:57.479 --> 01:00:59.786
or you'll probably be
sexually harassed at your job.

1292
01:01:08.099 --> 01:01:09.927
- We need to be tuned in.

1293
01:01:10.057 --> 01:01:12.451
We can't passively interact the
way that television allows us

1294
01:01:12.581 --> 01:01:13.974
to sit back and consume.

1295
01:01:14.105 --> 01:01:16.020
And we need to remember

1296
01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:18.196
that we are actually
in charge of the platform.

1297
01:01:18.326 --> 01:01:20.111
It isn't the platform
in charge of us.

1298
01:01:20.241 --> 01:01:22.896
- One of the reasons the TikTok
algorithm is so powerful

1299
01:01:23.027 --> 01:01:25.072
is it's based on something
called dwell time

1300
01:01:25.203 --> 01:01:27.509
and actually
what you're watching.

1301
01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:30.643
So it's not as much
what you like or share;

1302
01:01:30.774 --> 01:01:32.340
it's what you're actually
watching.

1303
01:01:32.471 --> 01:01:34.995
which is a much better indicator
of what you as a consumer

1304
01:01:35.126 --> 01:01:36.910
are interested in.

1305
01:01:37.041 --> 01:01:39.696
So as much as consumers
might say they don't want drama.

1306
01:01:39.826 --> 01:01:41.523
they don't want a certain
type of content.

1307
01:01:41.654 --> 01:01:44.875
it actually is sort of a mirror
back to ourselves

1308
01:01:45.005 --> 01:01:47.442
because we're the ones that
are liking. commenting.

1309
01:01:47.573 --> 01:01:50.010
sharing. and engaging
with that content.

1310
01:01:51.316 --> 01:01:53.144
- Yeah.

1311
01:01:54.972 --> 01:01:57.322
- I was getting harassed a lot
in the DMs by people saying.

1312
01:01:57.452 --> 01:01:59.716
Why weren't you in the new
Jackass? Jackass stole your bit.

1313
01:01:59.846 --> 01:02:01.848
Have you seen the new Jackass?
How come they didn't ask you

1314
01:02:01.979 --> 01:02:04.024
to be in the mime bit?
Blah. blah. blah.

1315
01:02:04.155 --> 01:02:08.028
So I just posted an Instagram
video dressed as the mime.

1316
01:02:08.159 --> 01:02:11.118
and I said. You can't trademark
a genius idea.

1317
01:02:11.249 --> 01:02:13.381
Kind of egg on the people

1318
01:02:13.512 --> 01:02:15.644
that were already harassing me
about that.

1319
01:02:15.775 --> 01:02:18.082
And I guess Steve-O
might not have known.

1320
01:02:18.212 --> 01:02:21.825
He has known about me since 2017
when I snorted pepper spray

1321
01:02:21.955 --> 01:02:23.391
'cause he sent me
a video saying.

1322
01:02:23.522 --> 01:02:26.003
"Good job on the pepper spray
snort. bro."

1323
01:02:26.133 --> 01:02:28.875
And he said. "Looking at the
comments on your last post.

1324
01:02:29.006 --> 01:02:31.225
people are saying that we copied
you with our silent game bit.

1325
01:02:31.356 --> 01:02:32.749
Did you really do that first?"

1326
01:02:32.879 --> 01:02:34.838
And I just basically replied
saying.

1327
01:02:34.968 --> 01:02:37.101
Yeah. that's been my thing
for two. three years now.

1328
01:02:38.798 --> 01:02:41.192
And he replied saying
something like. "Yikes."

1329
01:02:41.322 --> 01:02:44.064
But moral of the story is that
I did get the follow back.

1330
01:02:44.195 --> 01:02:46.284
So...

1331
01:02:46.414 --> 01:02:48.590
Steve-O's been an inspiration.
so that's really cool.

1332
01:02:51.245 --> 01:02:53.073
I mean. who knows? Maybe
they'll do a Jackass 5

1333
01:02:53.204 --> 01:02:55.380
and I'll be the star.

1334
01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:58.862
You never know. I mean.
life can work that way. Right?

1335
01:03:08.349 --> 01:03:11.309
- I feel like things are just
getting worse.

1336
01:03:11.439 --> 01:03:15.487
You know? It's like
after the whole Subway thing.

1337
01:03:15.617 --> 01:03:18.446
when I just reflect
on my reputation.

1338
01:03:18.577 --> 01:03:22.407
I'm like... that thought of
suicide was definitely there.

1339
01:03:22.537 --> 01:03:24.757
It was there multiple times.
You know?

1340
01:03:24.888 --> 01:03:27.629
Even though I'm not dead.

1341
01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.936
I feel like it's only
a matter of time. I guess.

1342
01:03:30.067 --> 01:03:31.677
It's just deep depression.
I guess.

1343
01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:33.418
It does that to people.

1344
01:03:35.289 --> 01:03:39.903
For some people like myself.
it becomes your life.

1345
01:03:40.991 --> 01:03:44.516
I've adapted to it for so long.
it's just a part of me.

Suicidal thoughts
kind of start off like.

1347
01:03:47.562 --> 01:03:49.477
"Oh. what if I wasn't here
no more? Who would care?"

1348
01:03:49.608 --> 01:03:51.566
It's not really thinking.

1349
01:03:51.697 --> 01:03:54.004
"Oh. I should kill myself."

1350
01:03:54.134 --> 01:03:56.180
but I wonder
who would care if I wasn't?

1351
01:03:56.310 --> 01:03:58.269
And that's kind of the slow
process of like.

1352
01:03:58.399 --> 01:03:59.966
no. I don't want to be here
no more. But you never know.

1353
01:04:00.097 --> 01:04:02.273
I think people that killed
themselves.

1354
01:04:02.403 --> 01:04:04.362
they know it's coming. but
they don't know exactly when.

1355
01:04:04.492 --> 01:04:06.016
I think it just hits them.

1356
01:04:06.146 --> 01:04:08.192
So I try to be humble
about that.

Nice try.

1362
01:04:37.569 --> 01:04:39.353

something like this

in a threatening situation

Number one rule:
check your surfaces.

Sometimes these tries
take like 30 tries.

You know. you watch the videos.
you watch people do it.

It looks like. Oh. they're just
super good

- I wouldn't do something

1384
01:05:34.713 --> 01:05:36.497
if it's not in front of a camera
or for views.

1385
01:05:36.628 --> 01:05:39.457
I guess I say this
because I have trained years.

1386
01:05:39.587 --> 01:05:41.894
Now I'm just at the point
where I want an audience

1387

my hard work to.

get better.

1391

go for it.

But if that's going to put
you out of your comfort zone.

1393
01:05:52.644 --> 01:05:54.515
then that's when you have
to call it there

1394

and say.
Why am I doing this?

1395
01:05:56.126 --> 01:05:58.432
And am I even capable
of doing this?

- You know your limits.
You know?

that's pretty much what it is.

who are like.

Man. what you do is so dumb.
but I watch it anyway.

Then there's a lot of people
who are like. That's so cool.

like that.

and I want to see
somebody do it.

And that's one of the reasons
I do it too.

1412
01:06:30.638 --> 01:06:32.423
is because if it wasn't me
up there doing it.

01:06:32.553 --> 01:06:34.120
I'm sure somebody else
would be up there doing it.

The risks of it is that

1415
01:06:36.209 --> 01:06:38.646
anybody with a cell phone now
can go do some stupid shit

1416

and think that
they're going to get famous

1417
01:06:41.301 --> 01:06:43.825
or get money from it
and then fuck themselves up

1418
01:06:43.956 --> 01:06:46.524
and get hurt. but that's always
been the risk.

1419
01:06:49.135 --> 01:06:52.138
People were doing dumb shit
before there were cameras. so...

I am proud of the amount
of followers

I'm not really happy with that.

for a lot more

self-sufficient off my content.

to get outside

some more viral content.

feel like Batman or Superman

on the edge of a building.

that feeling

01:07:36.617 --> 01:07:38.141

after.

the repercussions are

and all kinds of experiences.

because they see my Instagram.

they see my music.

and filtered through Instagram.

like I'm talking right now.

go to social media for anyway.

They want me to do
something crazy.

1453

probably all in all.

that have happened.

If I didn't spend
that six grand.

I wouldn't have met this person.
wouldn't have got this footage.

this thing to this person

as an investment.
Even if the trip is terrible

1474
01:09:36.737 --> 01:09:39.653
and nothing worked out.
you made noise somehow.

you have to look at it.

to try something bigger.

to supplement income.

it helped me pay
for where I'm living right now.

1514
01:11:41.819 --> 01:11:45.649
I feel like everyone can be
an online personality.

1515
01:11:45.779 --> 01:11:49.000
It's definitely easier
to do online.

1516
01:11:49.130 --> 01:11:50.784
You just post
whatever you want.

1517
01:11:50.915 --> 01:11:54.092

So as you're telling him that.

1520
01:11:58.662 --> 01:12:01.360
picture two or three people
that you love.

1521

TikTok. I could just be myself.

1526
01:12:15.983 --> 01:12:18.899
TikTok is just like.
"Yo. just pump out quantity."

1527
01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:21.119
Quantity over quality
for TikTok.

1528
01:12:21.249 --> 01:12:23.164
But for acting. I have to...

1529
01:12:23.295 --> 01:12:24.688
A lot of thought goes in it.

1530
01:12:24.818 --> 01:12:27.517
and it takes
a lot of mental energy.

01:12:45.056 --> 01:12:46.753
I finally figured out
what I'm going to do

1534

as far as creating content.

1535
01:12:48.581 --> 01:12:50.191
and honestly. I'm going to just
focus on music.

1536

I'm going to just go all in
with music

1537

this out.

I wanted to entertain.

so I just resorted
to paying for fame.

the definition

1644
01:17:51.623 --> 01:17:53.843
and that's
that we need to matter.

1645
01:17:53.973 --> 01:17:57.977
We need to feel relevant

important. contributive.

And I think that it's just

1648
01:18:02.895 --> 01:18:05.681
that fame has gotten confused
with relevance.

1649
01:18:05.811 --> 01:18:09.902
Because now when people are
famous they're feeling relevant.

1650
01:18:10.033 --> 01:18:13.514
and if they're feeling relevant
then they exist.

1651

and if they exist
then they matter.

that we're already famous.

My life. my existence. my fame.

1659
01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:43.893
And I need to matter
to the people in my life

1660
01:18:44.023 --> 01:18:46.983
who I touch and who touch me.

1661
01:18:47.113 --> 01:18:49.028
It can't just be about me.

1662
01:18:49.159 --> 01:18:51.335
It has to be about we.

1663
01:18:58.559 --> 01:19:01.214
- It's hard to say who you are.

1664
01:19:01.345 --> 01:19:03.956
I think we all struggle
with identity issues.

1665
01:19:04.087 --> 01:19:07.351
I've been a lot of people
in 23 years.

I used to have glasses
and be bullied.

1669

And I used to believe
in unicorns when I was a child.

1670
01:19:23.410 --> 01:19:25.151
Never made fun of me for it.

1671
01:19:25.282 --> 01:19:29.112
Then I also was a fucking
drug addict in college.

1672
01:19:29.242 --> 01:19:32.942
And I was a girl

1673
01:19:33.072 --> 01:19:35.901
who had really
abusive boyfriends.

1674
01:19:36.032 --> 01:19:38.251
And I was a girl
who licked a toilet seat.

1675
01:19:38.382 --> 01:19:40.688
And I was a girl
who made Skinny Legend Anthem.

1676
01:19:40.819 --> 01:19:43.126
But I'm also a girl
who really loves her cats.

1677
01:19:45.389 --> 01:19:47.913
and really loves
her best friend.

1678
01:19:51.438 --> 01:19:53.919
and a girl who really loves
her life now.

1679
01:19:55.312 --> 01:19:57.357
And I'm a girl who has
an OnlyFans.

1680
01:19:57.488 --> 01:20:00.796
and a girl who has a verified
check mark on Instagram.

1681
01:20:00.926 --> 01:20:04.495
I'm so many things. so why
ever put a label on it?

1682
01:20:04.625 --> 01:20:07.063
And I think people
want to do that really badly.

1683
01:20:07.193 --> 01:20:09.108
So I don't know.

1684
01:20:09.239 --> 01:20:12.068
I just... I am Ava.
That's that.

1685
01:20:18.335 --> 01:20:20.946
- The brand going forward is
just Jumanne

1686
01:20:21.077 --> 01:20:22.687
to kind of reflect
that I'm trying to change.

1687
01:20:25.211 --> 01:20:27.344
I'm just going to be myself.
you know.

1688
01:20:27.474 --> 01:20:29.563
So people that are genuine
enough to really

1689
01:20:29.694 --> 01:20:31.391
see me
for who I am.

1690
01:20:31.522 --> 01:20:34.177
they'll just see the transition
that I'm trying to make.

1691
01:20:36.919 --> 01:20:39.747
â™ª You could see all of my flaws
I could never be right â™ª

1692
01:20:39.878 --> 01:20:41.445
â™ª 'Cause I'm usually wrong

1693
01:20:41.575 --> 01:20:44.665
â™ª I won't ever be perfect
this the way I was born â™ªâ™ª

1694
01:20:44.796 --> 01:20:46.319
At this point. it's just
about me

1695
01:20:46.450 --> 01:20:50.149
doing everything that I need
to do to rebrand myself

1696
01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:51.977
and rebuild my platform.

1697
01:20:52.108 --> 01:20:54.110
It's just going to have
to speak for itself.

1698
01:20:56.939 --> 01:20:58.244
My recording session.

1699
01:20:58.375 --> 01:21:00.551
the engineer and producer
that I was working with.

1700
01:21:00.681 --> 01:21:02.988
just the relationship that
I've been building with him.

1701
01:21:03.119 --> 01:21:05.469
I'm happy about that.
It was great.

1702
01:21:05.599 --> 01:21:07.775
It was a good experience.

1703
01:21:07.906 --> 01:21:10.169
â™ª Made it this far
I refuse to turn back now â™ª

1704
01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:12.998
â™ª Nothing left to lose
tell my why would I forfeit â™ª

1705
01:21:13.129 --> 01:21:15.783
â™ª Hate it or love it I'ma make
it out of the struggle â™ªâ™ª

1706
01:21:24.705 --> 01:21:27.360
It's been five years
since this all started.

1707
01:21:27.491 --> 01:21:29.580
and I'm done with all of it.

1708
01:21:29.710 --> 01:21:33.932
as far as all of this
struggling. the whole concept.

1709
01:21:34.063 --> 01:21:36.369
I'm going to just move forward.
man.

1710
01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:38.458
and move in a better direction

1711
01:21:38.589 --> 01:21:40.808
and learning from everything
that I did.

1712
01:21:40.939 --> 01:21:43.420
And I might not be able
to reach a point of success.

1713
01:21:43.550 --> 01:21:45.596
but I could definitely prove
that I'm not the person

1714
01:21:45.726 --> 01:21:47.380
that I portrayed to be.

1715
01:21:49.339 --> 01:21:51.297
Hey. y'all. What's good?
I'm doing it again.

1716
01:21:51.428 --> 01:21:53.778
Y'all want little
somethin' somethin'?

1717
01:21:53.909 --> 01:21:56.346
Yeah. that's all Jumanne.

1718
01:21:56.476 --> 01:21:58.826
And I'm just so happy.
I'm rapping.

1719
01:21:58.957 --> 01:22:00.828
I'm doing one of my dreams.

1720
01:22:00.959 --> 01:22:03.788
I really want to be a football
player. but it's all good.

1721
01:22:03.919 --> 01:22:06.486
Got my MySpace.
got my videos up there.

1722
01:22:06.617 --> 01:22:08.619
And y'all going
to see more on me.

1723
01:22:08.749 --> 01:22:11.143
All right?
Believe that. Peace.
